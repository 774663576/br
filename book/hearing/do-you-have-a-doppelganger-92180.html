<p>Even though the word comes from spiritual folklore, we use it in a very real way. When two people look very similar, we can call them doppelgangers.</p>
<p>English has other expressions that have a similar meaning. If someone looks like someone else, you can call them a look-alike, spitting image or mirror image.</p>
<p>Let's hear two friends use some of these expressions.</p>
<p><em>A: Were you at the airport yesterday?</em></p>
<p><em>B: No. I haven't been to the airport in over a year. </em></p>
<p><em>A: Are you sure about that? </em></p>
<p><em>B: I think I would know if I were at the airport. Why do you ask?</em></p>
<p><em>A: Well, if you weren't there, then I ran into your doppelganger. She was a mirror image of you!</em></p>
<p><em>B: Wow, I've heard about doppelgangers. But I didn't think I really had a look-alike out there in the world. </em></p>
<p><em>A: Well, you do. And they are on their way to Costa Rica. </em></p>
<p><em>B: I wish I could trade places with my doppelganger!</em></p>
<p>If you know someone who looks exactly like another person, you can also call them a dead ringer.</p>
<p>Experts say this expression comes from American horse racing, and usage began in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
<p>Sometimes, racehorse owners would race a horse under a false name and <strong>pedigree</strong>. They did this to trick people who bet money on race results. These horses were called "ringers."</p>
<p>Here is how to use this expression in a sentence: My best friend in college is a dead ringer for George Clooney. When we're out in public, he gets asked for his autograph all the time.</p>
<p>In the expression "dead ringer," the word "dead" does not mean lifeless. In this case, it means exact or <strong>precise</strong>. It is a way to add <strong>emphasis, </strong>or highlight something. For example, if I am sure that my friend is right about something, I can say she is dead right. We can also say someone is "dead wrong" if they are most certainly wrong.</p>

[00:00.04]And now, Words and Their Stories,
[00:12.20]from VOA Learning English.
[00:15.08]English borrows from many other languages.
[00:23.64]And today we talk about a word
[00:26.84]that comes from German – doppelganger.
[00:31.84]The word "doppelganger"
[00:33.68]comes from German folklore.
[00:37.16]The online dictionary Merriam-Webster
[00:40.04]describes the old story.
[00:42.96]All living creatures have a spirit
[00:45.88]who is invisible but exactly the same
[00:50.16]as the living person.
[00:53.28]But just because you can't see them,
[00:55.96]doppelgangers are not ghosts.
[00:59.04]They are sometimes described
[01:01.64]as "the spiritual opposite or negative
[01:05.44]of their human counterpart."
[01:09.04]Even though the word
[01:10.44]comes from spiritual folklore,
[01:12.96]we use it in a very real way.
[01:17.08]When two people look very similar,
[01:20.04]we can call them doppelgangers.
[01:24.44]English has other expressions
[01:26.68]that have a similar meaning.
[01:30.32]If someone looks like someone else,
[01:33.40]you can call them a look-alike,
[01:36.12]spitting image or mirror image.
[01:41.64]Let's hear two friends
[01:43.44]use some of these expressions.
[01:46.32]A: Were you at the airport yesterday?
[01:48.48]B: No. I haven't been to the airport in over a year.
[01:52.44]A: Are you sure about that?
[01:54.20]B: I think I would know
[01:55.36]if I were at the airport.
[01:57.04]Why do you ask?
[01:58.88]A: Well, if you weren't there,
[02:00.48]then I ran into your doppelganger.
[02:02.24]She was a mirror image of you!
[02:04.40]B: Wow, I've heard about doppelgangers.
[02:07.64]But I didn't think I really had
[02:10.36]a look-alike out there in the world.
[02:12.56]A: Well, you do.
[02:14.16]And they are on their way to Costa Rica.
[02:16.96]B: I wish I could trade places with my doppelganger!
[02:21.24]If you know someone who looks
[02:23.56]exactly like another person,
[02:26.00]you can also call them a dead ringer.
[02:31.56]Experts say this expression comes
[02:34.56]from American horse racing,
[02:37.04]and usage began in the late 19th century.
[02:43.12]Sometimes, racehorse owners
[02:46.00]would race a horse
[02:47.84]under a false name and pedigree.
[02:52.00]They did this to trick people
[02:54.00]who bet money on race results.
[02:57.52]These horses were called "ringers."
[03:00.64]Here is how to use this expression in a sentence:
[03:05.16]My best friend in college
[03:07.56]is a dead ringer for George Clooney.
[03:11.24]When we're out in public,
[03:12.92]he gets asked for his autograph all the time.
[03:18.68]In the expression "dead ringer,"
[03:21.08]the word "dead" does not mean lifeless.
[03:24.84]In this case, it means exact or precise.
[03:30.56]It is a way to add emphasis,
[03:32.84]or highlight something.
[03:35.80]For example, if I am sure
[03:38.00]that my friend is right about something,
[03:40.52]I can say she is dead right.
[03:44.40]We can also say someone is "dead wrong"
[03:47.60]if they are most certainly wrong.
[03:52.24]The next time you want to describe two people
[03:55.04]who look the same,
[03:56.60]you can choose any of these expressions.
[03:59.84]And that's all the time we have
[04:02.60]for this Words and Their Stories.
[04:04.68]Until next time ...
[04:06.40]I'm Anna Matteo.
