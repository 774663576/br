。
[00:01.24]The Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, or GAVI,
[00:07.00]struggled to buy vaccines for needy countries
[00:10.32]during the COVID-19 pandemic.
[00:14.04]The organization said it has now set up plans
[00:17.80]to draw money immediately
[00:19.40]if it needs to buy vaccines for future pandemics.
[00:24.32]GAVI Chief Executive Seth Berkley said
[00:27.40]that, in 2020 and 2021,
[00:30.52]GAVI was limited in its ability to buy COVID-19 vaccines.
[00:36.52]Although donors had promised to give GAVI $2.4 billion,
[00:41.64]the group only had $400 million in cash on hand.
[00:47.36]Berkley told Reuters: "We've now put in a series
[00:50.64]of really interesting instruments. Some here in the U.S.,
[00:54.80]some in Europe, that allow us to front-load donor funding...
[01:00.12]we can then go ahead and make those commitments and start spending,
[01:04.28]knowing that those donors' funds will come."
[01:08.40]"The idea would be to have enough to jumpstart it," Berkley said.
[01:13.68]In April, GAVI announced a similar funding plan
[01:17.32]of $4.8 billion as part of its COVID response.
[01:23.08]GAVI and the World Health Organization (WHO)
[01:26.84]ran the international COVAX program.
[01:31.16]That partnership provides COVID-19 vaccines
[01:35.20]to the world's poorer countries.
[01:38.48]COVAX has sent more than 1.72 billion vaccine treatments to 146 countries.
[01:46.92]Still, the group struggled to buy enough vaccines
[01:50.88]to share with poor countries in the first half of 2021.
[01:56.32]Berkley said that was because some countries,
[01:59.40]including the United States, India, South Africa and Britain,
[02:04.84]wanted to keep a large number of vaccines for themselves.
[02:10.04]"All across the world, there were countries saying,
[02:13.20]‘We're only going to take care of ourselves first,'" he said.
[02:18.40]Berkley said that for future pandemics it will be important
[02:22.88]to make vaccines in more places
[02:25.64]and develop vaccine manufacturing ability
[02:29.56]in smaller countries like Singapore and Rwanda.
[02:34.04]Now, improved production has led
[02:36.48]to an oversupply of vaccines this year.
[02:40.84]Since June, COVAX has even been asking vaccine makers
[02:45.32]to cut or slow deliveries of 400 million
[02:49.12]to 600 million vaccine treatments.
[02:53.20]COVAX already has 300 to 400 million COVID-19 vaccine doses available
[03:00.72]if countries need more supply, Berkley said.
