In 1822, an American professor named Clement Clarke Moore wrote a poem that redefined the image of Saint Nicholas. It was called "Account of a Visit from Saint Nicholas." He did not expect it to be published. He wrote it as a Christmas present for his young children. In recent years, experts have questioned whether Moore actually wrote the poem.</p>
<p>Some believe it was written by Henry Livingston, a map maker in New York who wrote and published funny poems in his spare time.</p>
<p>But whoever wrote this classic poem, it has since become a favorite around the world. This poem combines the traditions of Santa Claus, seasonal decorations and gift-giving that have come to define Christmas in America.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="VOA Learning English Presents 'A Visit From St. Nicholas'" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/9BC4B48F-8C2D-4097-B73E-B411786E115D_w268_r1.png"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">VOA Learning English Presents 'A Visit From St. Nicholas'</span></div>
<p>We give you the staff of Learning English reading Clement Clarke Moore's poem, popularly known as "'Twas the Night Before Christmas."</p>
<p>
<em>‘Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house<br/>
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.<br/>
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,<br/>
In hopes that Saint Nicholas soon would be there.</em></p>
<p><em>The children were nestled all snug in their beds,<br/>
While visions of sugar plums danced in their heads.<br/>
And mamma in her ‘kerchief, and I in my cap,<br/>
Had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap.</em></p>
<p><em>When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,<br/>
I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.<br/>
Away to the window I flew like a flash,<br/>
Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.</em></p>
<p><em>The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow<br/>
Gave lustre of mid-day to objects below.<br/>
When, what to my wondering eyes did appear,<br/>
But a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny reindeer.</em></p>
<p><em>With a little old driver, so lively and quick,<br/>
I knew in a moment it must be Saint Nick.<br/>
More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,<br/>
And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name!</em></p>
<p><em>"Now Dasher! Now, Dancer! Now, Prancer and Vixen!<br/>
On, Comet! On, Cupid! On Donder and Blitzen!<br/>
To the top of the porch! To the top of the wall!<br/>
Now dash away! Dash away! Dash away all!"</em></p>
<p><em>As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,<br/>
When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky.<br/>
So up to the house-top the coursers they flew,<br/>
With the sleigh full of toys, and Saint Nicholas, too.</em></p>
<p><em>And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof<br/>
The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.<br/>
As I drew in my head, and was turning around,<br/>
Down the chimney Saint Nicholas came with a bound.</em></p>
<p><em>He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,<br/>
And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot.<br/>
A bundle of toys he had flung on his back,<br/>
And he looked like a peddler, just opening his pack.</em></p>
<p><em>His eyes -- how they twinkled! His dimples how merry!<br/>
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!<br/>
His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,<br/>
And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow.</em></p>
<p><em>The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,<br/>
And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath.<br/>
He had a broad face and a little round belly,<br/>
That shook when he laughed, like a bowlful of jelly!<br/>
He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,<br/>
And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself!<br/>
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,<br/>
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.</em></p>
<p><em>He spoke not a word, and went straight to his work,<br/>
Filled all the stockings, then turned with a jerk.<br/>
And laying his finger aside of his nose,<br/>
And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose!</em></p>
<p><em>He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,<br/>
And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.<br/>
But I heard him exclaim, ‘ere he drove out of sight,<br/>
"Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good-night!"</em></p>
