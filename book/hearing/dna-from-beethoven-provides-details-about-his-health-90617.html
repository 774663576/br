[00:00.04]Researchers who examined DNA
[00:03.68]from famous German composer Ludwig van Beethoven
[00:08.56]have learned new details about his health.
[00:13.76]The DNA – which came from Beethoven's hair
[00:18.08]– did not provide a cause for his deafness.
[00:22.00]But the samples did find
[00:25.08]that he had a genetic risk for liver disease.
[00:29.96]The DNA also showed evidence that Beethoven
[00:34.84]was infected with the virus hepatitis B
[00:38.88]in the last months of his life.
[00:42.56]The virus damages the liver.
[00:45.16]The findings recently appeared in a study
[00:49.56]in the publication Current Biology.
[00:53.16]The findings suggest Beethoven's liver issues
[00:58.24]were enough to cause the liver failure
[01:01.88]widely believed to have killed him.
[01:04.68]The composer was also believed
[01:08.12]to have been a heavy drinker of alcohol,
[01:11.24]which can affect the liver.
[01:13.84]March 26 is the 196th anniversary
[01:19.92]of Beethoven's death in Vienna, Austria.
[01:23.88]The composer himself wrote that he wanted doctors
[01:28.72]to study his health problems after he died.
[01:32.96]Axel Schmidt is a geneticist
[01:36.68]at Germany's University Hospital Bonn
[01:40.12]who helped lead the research.
[01:42.84]He told The Associated Press
[01:45.84]it is established that Beethoven's sicknesses
[01:50.00]had "sometimes very much limited his creative work."
[01:55.04]Schmidt added that for many doctors,
[01:59.00]"it has always been a mystery" what exactly killed him.
[02:04.24]Since his death, scientists have long
[02:08.60]tried to piece together Beethoven's medical history.
[02:13.20]And they have offered a series of possible explanations
[02:18.16]for his many health conditions.
[02:21.00]But new examination technology and methods
[02:25.60]now make it possible to revisit health
[02:29.08]and death information by studying ancient DNA.
[02:34.92]The DNA samples were collected from locks of hair
[02:40.12]that had been cut from Beethoven's head.
[02:43.80]After cleaning Beethoven's hair one piece at a time,
[02:48.64]scientists put the pieces into a substance
[02:53.04]and collected small amounts of DNA,
[02:56.84]said study author Tristan James Alexander Begg.
[03:02.64]He was a writer of the study and is a biology professor
[03:07.76]at the University of Cambridge.
[03:10.24]Getting enough genetic material was difficult,
[03:14.68]said another writer of the study, Johannes Krause.
[03:19.40]He is a paleogeneticist at Germany's
[03:23.40]Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology.
[03:28.72]Krause said the process was difficult
[03:32.68]because DNA in hair
[03:35.28]gets cut up into very small pieces.
[03:38.96]But finally, after using up almost 3 meters of Beethoven's hair,
[03:45.56]the team was able to piece together a genome
[03:49.40]that they could test for signs of genetic disease, Krause said.
[03:56.24]The question of what caused Beethoven's hearing loss
[04:00.36]remains unanswered, said Ohio State University's Dr. Avraham Z. Cooper.
[04:08.76]He was not involved in the study.
[04:12.28]Cooper said that mystery might continue forever
[04:16.64]because genetics can only show us
[04:19.72]half of the "nature and nurture" elements
[04:23.76]that make up our health.
[04:25.84]However, Cooper added that the mystery
[04:29.84]is part of what makes Beethoven so interesting and popular:
[04:35.72]"I think the fact that we can't know is OK," he said.
