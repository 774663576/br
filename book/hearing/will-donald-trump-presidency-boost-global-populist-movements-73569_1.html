<div class="content">Populist movements are making major gains across the world with the inauguration of Donald Trump as the 45th president of the United States.随着川普就任美国第45任总统，民粹主义在全球取得重大进展。
<p>Most political observers believe Trump's path to the presidency was fueled by populist policies. Populist movements attempt to appeal to common people by rejecting established political organizations often seen as elite.大多数政治观察家认为，川普的总统之路是由民粹主义政策所推动的。民粹主义运动试图通过否定被视为精英的既定政治组织来吸引普通人。</p>
<p>In his inauguration speech, Trump spoke of his strong desire to put the interests of Americans first, above all else.<br/>川普在就职演说中谈到了他将美国人的利益放在首位的强烈愿望。</p>
<p>Trump said his administration will seek "friendship and goodwill" with other nations. But he added: "We do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first."<br/>川普说，我们将谋求与其它国家的友谊和友好。但他补充说：“但我们是本着这样的理解去做，即所有国家都有权利将自己的利益放在第一位。”</p>
<p>"We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs," he said. "Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength."<br/>他说：“我们必须保护我们的国界，不让其他国家制造我们的产品，窃取我们的公司，破坏我们的就业。实行保护将带来宏伟的繁荣和实力。”</p>
<p>In the past, Trump has questioned the relevance of the 67-year-old NATO military alliance. During his speech, he said the United States will aim to "reinforce old alliances and form new ones."<br/>过去，川普曾质疑已经成立67年的北约军事联盟的实质作用。他在演讲中表示，美国的目标是“强化既有联盟并形成新的联盟。”</p>
<p>Trump has repeatedly promised to build a wall along the southern U.S. border to keep illegal immigrants out. He also called for severe immigration enforcement measures for people already in the U.S.<br/>川普一再承诺在美国南部边境修建一堵高墙，把非法移民挡在门外。他还呼吁对已经在美国的人士实施严格的移民执法措施。</p>
<p>Thomas Greven is a political science professor at Germany's Free University of Berlin. He says Trump won the presidency with a message of economic protectionism and tough immigration reforms.<br/>托马斯·格雷文（Thomas Greven）是德国柏林自由大学的政治学教授。他说，川普当上总统意味着经济保护主义和严厉的移民改革。</p>
<p>He said Trump could give a boost to other populist movements around the world, depending on how he handles his first months in office.<br/>他说，川普可能会促进世界各地的民粹运动，这取决于他上任首月的动作。</p>
<p>"Now right-wing populists everywhere who feel validated by Trump's victory will have to account - to a certain extent - for everything he does and says."<br/>他说：“现在各地受到川普胜选鼓舞的右翼民粹主义者将必须在一定程度上考虑川普的所作和所言。”</p>
<p>But Greven said Trump could disappoint supporters both at home and abroad if his policies end up offending other nations.<br/>但是格雷文表示，如果川普的政策最终发展到触怒其它国家，就可能会让国内外的支持者失望。</p>
<p>"An international movement of nationalists is frail because they end up offending each other," he said.<br/>他说：“民族主义者国际运动非常薄弱，因为他们最终发展到触怒彼此。”</p>
<p>Similar policies have been used by political movements in other countries as a way to win votes.<br/>其它国家的政治运动也采用了类似政策以赢得选举。</p>
<p><strong>Brexit vote<br/>退欧公投</strong></p>
<p>One of the biggest examples was last year's Brexit referendum, in which British citizens voted to leave the European Union. The campaign for Britain leaving the E.U. also focused heavily on immigration issues. It said Britain was not able to effectively control the number of immigrants because of E.U. rules.<br/>最重大的例子之一就是去年的英国公投，英国公民投票决定退出欧盟。英国退欧运动也重点关注移民问题，它称由于欧盟的规定，英国无法有效控制移民数量。</p>
<p>The Brexit movement believed the E.U. imposed too many regulations in Britain. It also argued that its leaders were not accountable to the British government or its citizens.<br/>退欧运动认为欧盟对英国强加了过多规章。它还认为，欧盟领导人对英国政府或其公民不负责任。</p>
<p>Trump has repeatedly praised Britain's decision to leave the E.U. He recently said in an interview that Brexit would "end up being a great thing." He predicted that more E.U. members would choose to leave, mainly because of immigration problems in Europe.<br/>川普一再赞扬英国退出欧盟的决定。他最近在接受采访时表示，退欧最终将会发展成为一件伟大的事情。他预计会有更多欧盟成员国选择退出，主要是因为欧洲的移民问题。</p>
<p>"If refugees keep pouring into different parts of Europe, I think it's going to be very hard to keep it together, because people are angry about it," Trump said.<br/>川普说：“如果难民不断涌入欧盟各个地方，我认为将会很难维持欧盟的团结，因为人们对此非常生气。”</p>
<p><strong>Immigration, an issue in Germany's election<br/>移民也是德国大选的一项难题</strong></p>
<p>Trump has also criticized German Chancellor Angela Merkel for that country's decision to open its borders in 2015 to about one million refugees. Most of the refugees were Muslims fleeing war in the Middle East. Trump called the action "a catastrophic mistake."<br/>川普还批评了德国总理默克尔在2015年决定向100万难民开放该国边境。大多数难民是逃离中东战乱的穆斯林。川普称此举是一项灾难性的错误。</p>
<p>Merkel is seeking a fourth term as chancellor in elections to be held in September. Her popularity has dropped since the refugee crisis.<br/>默克尔正谋求在9月份举行的大选中第四次连任总理。自难民危机以来她的人气已经有所下降。</p>
<p>Last month, a man drove a truck through a Christmas market in Berlin, killing 12 people. The anti-immigration Alternative for Germany party (AfD) blamed Merkel's immigration policies for allowing the attack to happen.<br/>上月，一名男子驾驶开车冲入柏林的一家圣诞市场，造成12人死亡。反移民的德国另类选择党（简称AfD）指责默克尔的移民政策纵容了这次袭击的发生。</p>
<p>Professor Greven said the AfD will win a presence in parliament and is likely to make bigger gains at the state level.<br/>格雷文教授表示，德国另类选择党将会在议会中赢得一席之地，并且可能会在州一级赢得更大胜利。</p>
<p>Currently, Merkel's CDU-led alliance is leading in polls against the AfD. But even if her party wins in September, she will likely have to form a coalition government with other parties.<br/>目前，默克尔以基民盟为主导的联盟在民意调查中领先于德国另类选择党。但是即使她的党派在9月胜选，她可能还是必须同其它党派组成联合政府。</p>
<p><strong>Rise of National Front in France<br/>法国国民阵线的崛起</strong></p>
<p>In France, the leader of the far-right National Front (NF), Marine Le Pen, is a leading candidate for that country's presidential election in April. She has said she believes Trump's win and the Brexit vote have helped her campaign.<br/>在法国，极右翼国民阵线领导人勒庞是该国4月份总统选举的重要候选人。她说她相信川普的胜选和退欧公投帮助了她的竞选。</p>
<p>The National Front has heavily used anti-immigration policies to win voter support. It has specifically spoken out against Muslim immigration after several major terrorist attacks hit France.<br/>国民阵线大量使用反移民政策来赢得选民支持。在法国发生的几次重大恐怖主义袭击之后，它都特意站出来大声疾呼反对穆斯林移民。</p>
<p>During a recent interview, Le Pen outlined some of her priorities if she won the presidency. She said she would hold a referendum on leaving the E.U., close French borders and push for an alliance with Russia and the United States to fight Islamist terrorism.<br/>在最近的一次采访中，勒庞概述了如果她当上总统要做的一些优先事项。她说，她将会就退出欧盟、关闭法国边界、推动同俄美两国联盟共同打击伊斯兰恐怖主义举行一次全民公投。</p>
<p>Greven said France's National Front has moved on from being the party of the lower middle class to more of a working class party. It is now appealing to a larger number of voters, including former communists and socialists, he added.<br/>格雷文表示，法国国民阵线已经从中产阶级下层的政党更多地转变为一家工人阶级政党。他补充说，该党现在吸引了更多选民，包括前共产主义者和社会主义者。</p>
<p>Other politicians in Europe have also faced strong opposition from populist or nationalist candidates.<br/>欧洲的其他政治家也面临着来自民粹主义和民族主义候选人的强烈反对。</p>
<p><strong>Populist Movement in other EU nations<br/>欧洲其它国家的民粹主义运动</strong></p>
<p>In a close race in Austria last month, far-right candidate Norbert Hofer won 47 percent of the vote against Green Party candidate Alexander Van der Bellen. Even though Hofer lost, the close election reflected increasing gains of populist movements.<br/>上个月在奥地利举行的一场势均力敌的竞选中，极右派候选人诺伯特·霍费尔（Norbert Hofer）在同绿党候选人亚历山大·范德贝伦（Alexander Van der Bellen）的竞选中赢得了47%的选票。即使霍费尔失败了，这场势均力敌的选举也反映了民粹主义运动不断获利。</p>
<p>In Italy, Prime Minister Matteo Renzi resigned in December after losing to populist and national parties in a referendum over constitutional reforms.<br/>在修宪公投败给了民粹主义和民族主义政党后，意大利总理马修·伦齐（Matteo Renzi）在12月提出了辞职。</p>
<p>In the Netherlands, recent polls showed continued strong support for far-right politician Geert Wilders ahead of a general election in March.<br/>荷兰最近的民意调查显示了3月大选之前对极右翼政治家吉尔特·威尔德斯（Geert Wilders）的持续大力支持。</p>
<p>Wilders and his Freedom Party have repeatedly made statements against Islam and Muslim immigration. Wilders himself was found guilty of inciting discrimination and insulting a minority group. The charges came after he led a chant at a meeting calling for the Netherlands to accept fewer Moroccan immigrants.<br/>威尔德斯及其自由党一再声明反对伊斯兰和穆斯林移民。威尔德斯本人被判犯有煽动歧视和侮辱少数群体的罪名。这些指控是他在一场呼吁荷兰人接收少量摩洛哥移民的会议上带头反复喊口号之后发出的。</p>

[by:www.21voa.com]
[00:00.00]快捷键：S播放/暂停，A快退，D快进，W循环。
[00:00.00]Populist movements are making major gains across the world
[00:05.14]with the inauguration of Donald Trump as the 45th president of the United States.
[00:13.06]Most political observers believe Trump's path to the presidency was fueled by populist policies.
[00:23.90]Populist movements attempt to appeal to common people
[00:28.96]by rejecting established political organizations often seen as elite.
[00:36.85]In his inauguration speech, Trump spoke of his strong desire
[00:43.15]to put the interests of Americans first, above all else.
[00:49.03]Trump said his administration will seek "friendship and goodwill" with other nations.
[00:57.49]But he added: "We do so with the understanding
[01:01.96]that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first."
[01:08.72]"We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products,
[01:16.17]stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs," he said.
[01:21.63]"Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength."
[01:27.56]In the past, Trump has questioned the relevance of the 67-year-old NATO military alliance.
[01:36.94]During his speech, he said the United States will aim to "reinforce old alliances and form new ones."
[01:47.23]Trump has repeatedly promised to build a wall along the southern U.S. border to keep illegal immigrants out.
[01:57.10]He also called for severe immigration enforcement measures for people already in the U.S.
[02:05.88]Thomas Greven is a political science professor at Germany's Free University of Berlin.
[02:15.13]He says Trump won the presidency with a message of economic protectionism and tough immigration reforms.
[02:25.63]He said Trump could give a boost to other populist movements around the world,
[02:32.26]depending on how he handles his first months in office.
[02:36.81]"Now right-wing populists everywhere who feel validated by Trump's victory will have to account
[02:45.90]- to a certain extent - for everything he does and says."
[02:51.65]But Greven said Trump could disappoint supporters
[02:56.27]both at home and abroad if his policies end up offending other nations.
[03:03.22]"An international movement of nationalists is frail because they end up offending each other," he said.
[03:13.41]Similar policies have been used by political movements in other countries as a way to win votes.
[03:22.39]One of the biggest examples was last year's Brexit referendum,
[03:28.48]in which British citizens voted to leave the European Union.
[03:33.18]The campaign for Britain leaving the E.U. also focused heavily on immigration issues.
[03:41.30]It said Britain was not able to effectively control the number of immigrants because of E.U. rules.
[03:49.82]The Brexit movement believed the E.U. imposed too many regulations in Britain.
[03:57.03]It also argued that its leaders were not accountable to the British government or its citizens.
[04:04.95]Trump has repeatedly praised Britain's decision to leave the E.U.
[04:10.69]He recently said in an interview that Brexit would "end up being a great thing."
[04:16.94]He predicted that more E.U. members would choose to leave,
[04:21.27]mainly because of immigration problems in Europe.
[04:25.63]"If refugees keep pouring into different parts of Europe,
[04:30.68]I think it's going to be very hard to keep it together, because people are angry about it," Trump said.
[04:38.33]Trump has also criticized German Chancellor Angela Merkel for that country's decision
[04:46.27]to open its borders in 2015 to about one million refugees.
[04:52.59]Most of the refugees were Muslims fleeing war in the Middle East.
[04:58.29]Trump called the action "a catastrophic mistake."
[05:02.96]Merkel is seeking a fourth term as chancellor in elections to be held in September.
[05:09.96]Her popularity has dropped since the refugee crisis.
[05:14.25]Last month, a man drove a truck through a Christmas market in Berlin, killing 12 people.
[05:22.08]The anti-immigration Alternative for Germany party (AfD)
[05:26.63]blamed Merkel's immigration policies for allowing the attack to happen.
[05:33.27]Professor Greven said the AfD will win a presence in parliament
[05:39.69]and is likely to make bigger gains at the state level.
[05:43.87]Currently, Merkel's CDU-led alliance is leading in polls against the AfD.
[05:51.81]But even if her party wins in September,
[05:55.73]she will likely have to form a coalition government with other parties.
[06:00.77]In France, the leader of the far-right National Front (NF), Marine Le Pen,
[06:07.51]is a leading candidate for that country's presidential election in April.
[06:12.84]She has said she believes Trump's win and the Brexit vote have helped her campaign.
[06:19.42]The National Front has heavily used anti-immigration policies to win voter support.
[06:27.21]It has specifically spoken out against Muslim immigration after several major terrorist attacks hit France.
[06:36.27]During a recent interview, Le Pen outlined some of her priorities if she won the presidency.
[06:44.11]She said she would hold a referendum on leaving the E.U.,
[06:48.86]close French borders and push for an alliance with Russia and the United States to fight Islamist terrorism.
[06:58.22]Greven said France's National Front has moved on
[07:02.84]from being the party of the lower middle class to more of a working class party.
[07:08.32]It is now appealing to a larger number of voters,
[07:11.83]including former communists and socialists, he added.
[07:17.00]Other politicians in Europe have also faced strong opposition from populist or nationalist candidates.
[07:26.66]In a close race in Austria last month, far-right candidate Norbert Hofer
[07:33.72]won 47 percent of the vote against Green Party candidate Alexander Van der Bellen.
[07:41.45]Even though Hofer lost, the close election reflected increasing gains of populist movements.
[07:49.49]In Italy, Prime Minister Matteo Renzi resigned in December
[07:55.53]after losing to populist and national parties in a referendum over constitutional reforms.
[08:03.31]In the Netherlands, recent polls showed continued strong support
[08:08.62]for far-right politician Geert Wilders ahead of a general election in March.
[08:15.43]Wilders and his Freedom Party have repeatedly made statements against Islam and Muslim immigration.
[08:23.92]Wilders himself was found guilty of inciting discrimination and insulting a minority group.
[08:31.71]The charges came after he led a chant at a meeting
