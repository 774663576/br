。
[00:00.04]A 14-year-old student from San Antonio, Texas,
[00:05.08]has won the Scripps National Spelling Bee on her fourth attempt.
[00:11.20]Harini Logan's victory came late Thursday
[00:14.96]in the first-ever spell-off tiebreaker of the competition.
[00:20.28]Logan spelled 21 words correctly
[00:24.68]during the 90-second spell-off.
[00:28.00]That was six more than her opponent,
[00:32.16]12-year-old Vikram Raju of Aurora, Colorado.
[00:38.04]The judges said the winning word was "moorhen,"
[00:42.40]which means a female, red grouse bird.
[00:47.40]Logan's victory came after it appeared
[00:50.48]that she had answered a question incorrectly
[00:53.96]during the vocabulary round of the spelling bee.
[00:57.56]But she was soon reinstated.
[01:01.24]She defined the word "pullulation"
[01:04.68]as the nesting of mating birds.
[01:07.48]But the judges said the correct answer
[01:10.60]was the swarming of bees.
[01:13.40]"My heart stopped for a second," Harini said.
[01:18.12]A few minutes later, head judge Mary Brooks
[01:22.32]said the judges studied the word and her answer.
[01:27.40]They decided to change their decision:
[01:30.80]"The answer you gave to that word is considered correct,
[01:34.92]so we are going to reinstate you."
[01:38.84]Grace Walters has trained Logan in spelling for some time.
[01:43.72]She said, "Harini has been to hell and back
[01:48.04]with her spelling bee experiences,"
[01:51.60]Harini said she was afraid when the spell-off
[01:55.08]was introduced last year,
[01:57.08]saying, "I go slow. That's my thing.
[02:01.40]I didn't know how I would fare in that setting."
[02:06.40]Over the past few months, Harini
[02:09.16]prepared for the possibility of a spell-off.
[02:13.12]And on Thursday, Harini won the $50,000 in prizes.
[02:19.40]She is the first-ever spelling bee champion
[02:22.76]to have been reinstated during the competition.
[02:28.12]The Scripps National Spelling Bee
[02:30.64]takes place in Washington, D.C..
[02:33.20]It has been held since 1925.
[02:37.72]Vikram Raju came in second.
[02:40.72]He said: "I just had to be a little faster."
[02:44.48]He hopes to return next year.
[02:47.56]The spelling bee returned to in-person competition this year
[02:52.04]after being held mostly online last year.
[02:56.20]"In the end, it's all been worth it," Walters said.
[03:00.76]"This is the ending Harini deserves."
