。
[00:00.04]The West Coast of the United States
[00:03.04]produces over 90 percent of America's wine,
[00:07.76]an alcoholic drink.
[00:10.00]However, the area is also prone to wildfires.
[00:16.64]Such fires cost the American wine industry
[00:20.88]billions of dollars in 2020.
[00:25.20]The smoke affects the flavor of the growing grapes
[00:30.44]that later become the wine.
[00:32.88]And, the flavor is undesirable,
[00:35.76]say some wine drinkers.
[00:39.36]So, wine experts from state universities in the area
[00:44.40]are working together to protect wine grapes
[00:48.16]from wildfire smoke.
[00:52.36]In 2020, economists say,
[00:55.36]wildfires caused billions of dollars of losses,
[00:59.76]which included the wine industry.
[01:04.48]As a result, the U.S. Department of Agriculture
[01:08.92]is paying for grape research at some state schools.
[01:15.68]They include University of California, Davis (UC Davis),
[01:20.84]Oregon State University and Washington State University.
[01:27.16]The research investment is worthy, agriculture officials say,
[01:32.28]because wine grapes are America's highest-value crop.
[01:38.12]Tom Collins is a wine scientist at Washington State.
[01:43.12]He said "the ability to continue to make wine" is at risk
[01:47.84]in areas where smoke might be more common.
[01:52.12]Cole Cerrato is a researcher working on the problem in Oregon.
[01:58.48]He stood in Oregon State's vineyard,
[02:00.92]near the small town of Alpine.
[02:04.48]He lit a fire and blew the smoke through a hose
[02:08.72]and into a row of grapes covered in plastic.
[02:12.96]Cerrato and other researchers have done this before.
[02:18.12]They turned the treated grapes into wine.
[02:22.88]The result was, the wine
[02:25.52]had an unpleasant flavor of smoke and ash.
[02:32.16]The scientists are working to find a way
[02:34.92]to keep the smoke from getting through the grape skins
[02:39.20]and creating a bad taste in the wine.
[02:43.12]Some are trying to create a process
[02:46.28]that will treat wine and remove the smokiness.
[02:51.08]But they are concerned such a process
[02:54.28]might remove some of the wine's good flavors, too.
[02:59.20]Others think they can combine
[03:01.36]smoke-affected grapes with other grapes.
[03:04.28]The mix might lessen the smoky flavor.
[03:08.92]And Collins is working on a spray
[03:12.28]made from water and a kind of clay
[03:15.20]that would protect the grapes from smoke.
[03:19.20]But all the grapes would need to be washed first
[03:23.04]before being turned into wine.
[03:26.96]Oregon State is experimenting
[03:29.40]with a similar spray treatment for grapes.
[03:33.92]In addition, the USDA has provided $7 million
[03:39.16]toward setting up smoke sensors in vineyards.
[03:45.04]Anita Oberholster is leading the efforts
[03:48.36]to save the wine grapes at UC Davis.
[03:52.68]In an internet post by UC Davis,
[03:55.96]she said a network of sensors would help
[03:59.20]grape growers learn if their grapes are at risk.
[04:03.32]In addition, the readings from the sensors
[04:06.04]will permit the growers
[04:08.24]to prove their grapes are free from smoke damage.
[04:14.68]Winemakers are glad that the universities
[04:17.32]are working to help the industry.
[04:19.60]Greg Jones runs the Abacela winery
[04:23.28]in southern Oregon and is the director
[04:26.24]of the state's winemaking trade group.
[04:29.92]He said the research has "gone a long way."
[04:32.88]Now the grape-growers can quickly find out
[04:36.44]if the fruit has been hurt by the smoke.
[04:39.68]In the past, winemakers would not know
[04:42.92]about the wine until it was ready to drink.
[04:46.92]"I think it's increasingly clear that
[04:49.36]we're not likely to find a magic bullet," Collins said.
[04:53.44]But, he said, the researchers
[04:56.20]will find ways to keep the wine business successful.
