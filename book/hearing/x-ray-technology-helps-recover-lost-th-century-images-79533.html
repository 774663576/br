<p>The world's very first <strong>photographs</strong> were taken in the 1830s.</p>
<p>Scientists now say they have found a way to recover lost images made from the very first photographic process. The new method uses X-ray technology and light imaging to help save images badly damaged by the effects of age.</p>
<p>Researchers from Canada's <a class="wsw__a" href="http://www.uwo.ca/">University of Western Ontario</a> <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-27714-5">published</a> a report on their findings.</p>
<p>The first widely accepted photographic process was the creation of France's <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/dagu/hd_dagu.htm" target="_blank">Louis Daguerre</a> in 1839. Images made by this method were called <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.britannica.com/daguerreotype" target="_blank">daguerreotypes</a>.</p>
<div class="contentImage"><img alt="Portrait of Louis Daguerre (public domain)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/2B2B86BB-6435-4441-97F2-3A816D9631AB_w268_r0.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Portrait of Louis Daguerre (public domain)</span></div>
<p>The process involved combining metal particles and chemicals on a silver-covered piece of copper to <strong>reflect</strong>, or give back, images of light. This reflective process was able to produce sharp, colorless pictures. In the beginning, the technology required people to sit completely still for at least one minute for the process to capture a photograph.</p>
<p>The daguerreotype first made it possible to capture and save "true" images that presented a realistic look at history. This is because, unlike paintings, daguerreotypes reflected exactly what was photographed.</p>
<p>But over time, daguerreotypes may suffer damage because of environmental conditions, such as heat and bright light. Some of the damaged images can become unrecognizable.</p>
<p>Research chemists at Western University <a class="wsw__a" href="https://mediarelations.uwo.ca/2018/06/22/western-led-research-team-uncovers-lost-images-19th-century-using-21st-century-tech/" target="_blank">say</a> they have found a high-tech way to bring these photographic treasures back to life. The team developed the process over several years while studying the chemical changes that harm daguerreotype images.</p><span class="c-sticky-element__close-el c-sticky-element__swipe-el ta-c" title="close"><span class="ico ico-close m-0"></span></span>
<p>
</p><p>The team used X-ray technology to map and examine daguerreotype <strong>plates</strong> from the 19th century. The process is designed to identify the levels and position of mercury particles on the plates.</p>
<p>Western University's <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.uwo.ca/chem/people/faculty/sham.htm" target="_blank">Tsun-Kong (T.K.) Sham</a> was one of the lead researchers on the project. He says mercury is necessary to creating photographic imagery. While the surface may be heavily damaged, the mercury particles remain.</p>
<p>"By looking at the mercury, we can <strong>retrieve</strong> the image in great detail," he said.</p>
<p>Researchers said the X-ray imaging process takes about eight hours on each daguerreotype plate. When complete, full images can be recovered, even if they could not be seen at all before.</p>
<p>The research chemists showed how their process helped <strong>restore</strong> two images from the collection of the <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.gallery.ca/">National Gallery of Canada</a>. Those photos - which experts say could have been created as early as 1850 - were <strong>tarnished</strong> so badly they were unrecognizable.</p>
<p><a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.facebook.com/ChemistryatWestern/posts/1733238460023839" target="_blank">Madalena Kozachuk</a> helped to lead the research. She is studying to earn a doctorate of philosophy in Western University's Department of Chemistry.</p>
<p>Kozachuk <a class="wsw__a" href="https://mediarelations.uwo.ca/2018/06/22/western-led-research-team-uncovers-lost-images-19th-century-using-21st-century-tech/">said</a> that she was surprised when the image first appeared after being "hidden behind time" for many years.</p>
<p>"But then we see it, and we can see such fine details: the eyes, the <strong>folds</strong> of the clothing, the detailed <strong>embroidered</strong> patterns of the table cloth," she said. </p>
<p>The researchers say they did not find evidence that any part of the process damaged the <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.daguerre.org/page/DagFAQ?" target="_blank">19th-century plates</a>.</p>
<p>Photography experts estimate that millions of daguerreotype images may have been created over 20 years in the 19th century. Eventually, the process was replaced with other methods.</p>
<p>"By improving the process of restoring these centuries-old images, the scientists are <strong>contributing</strong> to the historical record," the university said in a statement. "What was thought to be lost, showing the life and times of people from the 19th century, can now be found."</p>
<p>The researchers say this new way to recover lost images without damaging effects will help museums breathe new life into some of their oldest image collections.</p>
