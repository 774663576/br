<p class="Body">There are currently more than 533,000 .ai web domains, an increase of more than 10 times since 2018. Webster predicts domain-related earnings will keep rising, possibly even doubling this year from last year's $32 million.</p>

。
[00:00.04]The Caribbean island of Anguilla
[00:03.36]is getting a economic lift
[00:06.08]from companies registering internet addresses
[00:10.24]through the British territory.
[00:13.04]The companies are seeking to show
[00:16.80]they are involved
[00:18.08]in the artificial intelligence (AI) industry.
[00:22.52]One way to do this is
[00:25.20]to secure an internet address
[00:28.28]that ends in .ai.
[00:31.56]Anguilla owns the right
[00:34.28]to issue the .ai domain ending
[00:37.84]to organizations.
[00:39.92]It gained that right in the 1990s,
[00:43.88]based on the territory's name.
[00:46.80]Other nations and territories
[00:50.00]have similar control
[00:51.96]over domain registrations with letters
[00:55.32]with links to their name.
[00:57.52]For Anguilla, the popular rise of AI
[01:02.16]has permitted the territory
[01:04.52]to make a lot of money
[01:06.24]from new registrations ending in .ai.
[01:11.20]Some examples from the technology world
[01:15.60]include Google, which uses google.ai
[01:20.28]for its AI offerings.
[01:22.72]The chief of social media service X,
[01:26.48]Elon Musk, chose to register x.ai
[01:31.40]as the homepage for X‘s Grok AI tool.
[01:36.40]And AI search engine Perplexity
[01:40.40]uses perplexity.ai.
[01:44.56]In Anguilla, earnings from web domain registration
[01:49.24]increased by four times last year
[01:53.24]to $32 million as the rise in AI systems
[01:58.64]increased sharply.
[02:01.16]The earnings now account for about 20 percent
[02:05.16]of the total amount the government brings in.
[02:09.12]Before the increased interest in AI,
[02:13.20]the amount remained at about five percent.
[02:17.56]Anguilla's government
[02:19.80]– which uses the gov.ai domain
[02:23.32]– collects money each time
[02:25.72]an .ai web address is re-registered.
[02:29.96]It also gets paid when new addresses are registered
[02:34.68]and expired ones are sold off to new buyers.
[02:39.72]Some registrations have brought
[02:42.88]in tens of thousands of dollars.
[02:45.72]Anguilla is 91 square kilometers
[02:49.84]and has a population of about 16,000.
[02:54.24]Its ocean areas and natural offerings
[02:58.28]bring in foreign visitors.
[03:00.76]But the island has faced economic difficulties
[03:05.08]since the COVID-19 pandemic,
[03:08.16]and it can be hit by powerful storms.
[03:12.64]Anguilla does not have its own AI industry.
[03:17.28]But the territory's premier, Ellis Webster,
[03:21.52]hopes that will one day change.
[03:24.80]He told the Associated Press it was just luck
[03:29.52]that Anguilla was assigned the .ai domain.
[03:33.92]It could also have gone to nearby Antigua,
[03:38.12]which has the same letters in its name.
[03:42.08]Webster said the money from domain registrations
[03:46.56]eases pressure on government finances
[03:50.28]and helps support several important projects.
[03:54.44]But, he said the territory must be careful
[03:58.52]not to completely depend on it.
[04:01.64]"You can't predict how long this is going to last,"
[04:06.68]Webster told the AP.
[04:09.56]"So I don't want to have our economy and our country
[04:14.28]and all our programs just based on this."
[04:18.36]To help keep up with the explosive growth
[04:22.28]in .ai registrations,
[04:24.96]Anguilla signed a deal with a U.S.-based company,
[04:29.00]Identity Digital, to manage the process.
[04:33.44]The company has said it plans to add
[04:37.44]all .ai domain services
[04:40.48]to its systems by the start of next year.
[04:44.80]There are currently more than 533,000 .ai web domains,
[04:52.52]an increase of more than 10 times since 2018.
[04:57.60]Webster predicts domain-related earnings
[05:01.88]will keep rising, possibly even doubling this year
[05:06.56]from last year's $32 million.
[05:10.60]He noted the money can finance
[05:13.60]the expansion of the territory's airport,
[05:17.56]provide free medical care for older citizens
[05:21.52]and complete a technology job training center
[05:25.72]for high school students.
[05:28.16]The income also provides "budget support"
[05:32.56]for other projects the government
[05:34.96]plans to launch, Webster said.
[05:38.24]One of those is a national development program
[05:42.92]that includes money for hurricane recovery efforts.
