。
[00:00.04]A Mars explorer operated
[00:02.92]by the American space agency NASA
[00:06.36]has captured a rock that scientists say
[00:10.96]shows possible signs of ancient microbial life.
[00:15.92]NASA said in a recent statement
[00:19.60]that the Perseverance explorer, or rover,
[00:23.72]collected the rock on July 21.
[00:27.24]Scientists working on the Perseverance team
[00:31.72]nicknamed the rock "Cheyava Falls,"
[00:34.72]after the tallest waterfall in the Grand Canyon.
[00:39.20]The rover's exploration area is believed
[00:43.32]to include a former river valley
[00:46.48]measuring about 400 meters wide.
[00:49.80]The valley is thought to have formed by water
[00:54.16]rushing into Jezero Crater billions of years ago.
[01:00.12]Scientists believe the area around Jezero Crater
[01:05.08]contained large bodies of water in the distant past.
[01:09.96]NASA's statement says the rock shows signs of
[01:15.12]"chemical signatures and structures
[01:18.28]that could possibly have been formed
[01:21.16]by life billions of years ago..."
[01:24.64]NASA team members based their findings
[01:28.48]on examinations of the rock with imaging equipment
[01:32.48]and multiple scientific instruments.
[01:36.04]But they noted that additional research is needed
[01:40.40]to confirm a history of microbial life.
[01:44.96]The examinations did suggest
[01:48.32]the rock contains "organic compounds,"
[01:52.20]NASA said.
[01:53.80]But the statement added,
[01:55.84]"While such carbon-based molecules
[01:58.48]are considered the building blocks of life,
[02:01.92]they also can be formed
[02:04.24]by non-biological processes."
[02:07.68]Perseverance uses its robotic arm
[02:11.64]and drilling equipment to capture rock
[02:14.92]and soil samples from the Martian surface.
[02:19.20]So far, it has collected 22 samples.
[02:23.76]The rover has secured the samples in special containers
[02:28.44]and they are to be picked up and returned to Earth
[02:32.68]during a future mission.
[02:35.44]Ken Farley is a project scientist
[02:38.80]with the Perseverance team
[02:41.04]at Caltech in Pasadena, California.
[02:44.76]He said, "Cheyava Falls is the most puzzling,
[02:49.44]complex, and potentially important rock
[02:53.44]yet investigated by Perseverance."
[02:57.08]Farley said unusual color spots
[03:00.60]and other structural elements in the samples
[03:03.96]suggest "chemical reactions"
[03:06.92]that might have given energy
[03:09.36]to ancient microbial life.
[03:12.24]But he noted that so far, scientists
[03:16.16]have not been able to identify
[03:18.84]exactly how the rock formed.
[03:21.76]The team described the rock
[03:24.80]as containing white veins
[03:27.60]that may have been created
[03:29.56]by the substance calcium sulfate.
[03:32.88]Between the veins, examiners found
[03:36.00]lines of material with a reddish color.
[03:39.52]These lines suggest the presence of hematite,
[03:44.32]a common substance found in many rocks on Earth.
[03:49.00]David Flannery is an astrobiologist
[03:53.00]and member of the Perseverance science team
[03:57.00]from the Queensland University of Technology in Australia.
[04:02.68]He said that on Earth,
[04:04.84]these kinds of rock elements are often linked
[04:08.64]"with the fossilized record of microbes
[04:12.20]living in the subsurface."
[04:14.76]The scientists said the new findings
[04:18.52]strengthen existing evidence
[04:21.12]that such rocks may have been created
[04:24.16]or were changed by flowing water on Mars
[04:28.28]billions of years ago.
[04:30.56]Caltech's Farley said the rock sample
[04:34.44]had already been imaged
[04:36.60]and examined with lasers, X-ray equipment
[04:40.72]and other instruments
[04:42.40]as much as possible in recent weeks.
[04:45.84]He noted that Perseverance
[04:48.40]has done as much as it can
[04:50.72]to examine the newly discovered samples.
[04:54.28]Farley added, "To fully understand
[04:57.80]what really happened in that Martian river valley
[05:01.52]at Jezero Crater billions of years ago,
[05:05.32]we'd want to bring the Cheyava Falls
[05:08.56]sample back to Earth."
[05:10.76]That way, he said,
[05:13.08]"it can be studied with the powerful instruments
[05:16.88]available in laboratories."
