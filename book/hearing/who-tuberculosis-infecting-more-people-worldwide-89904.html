。
[00:00.04]A recent report by the World Health Organization (WHO)
[00:06.36]says the number of people infected
[00:08.92]with tuberculosis increased worldwide.
[00:12.52]The United Nations health agency
[00:15.64]said more than 10 million people around the world
[00:19.32]became sick with tuberculosis (TB) in 2021.
[00:25.72]That is a 4.5 percent increase from the year before.
[00:30.64]About 1.6 million people died, WHO said.
[00:35.96]It added that about 450,000 cases
[00:40.60]involved people infected with drug-resistant TB,
[00:44.88]3 percent more than in 2020.
[00:48.96]Dr. Mel Spigelman is president of the non-profit group TB Alliance.
[00:55.68]Spigelman said more than 10 years of progress
[00:59.04]was lost when COVID-19 appeared in 2020.
[01:04.52]He said that although there were gains in some areas
[01:08.64]"we are still behind in just about every...goal regarding TB."
[01:14.72]WHO also blamed COVID-19 for much of the rise in TB,
[01:20.92]saying the pandemic "continues to have a damaging" effect "
[01:25.44]on access to TB diagnosis and treatment."
[01:30.72]It said progress made before 2019
[01:34.00]has since slowed, stopped, or moved back.
[01:38.92]With fewer people being diagnosed with the highly infectious disease,
[01:44.24]more patients unknowingly spread tuberculosis.
[01:47.92]WHO also said COVID-19 restrictions,
[01:52.84]including lockdowns and physical distancing,
[01:56.20]also limited TB treatment services.
[01:59.56]Such restrictions may have caused some people
[02:03.00]to not go to health centers for fear of catching coronavirus.
[02:08.12]Officials added that issues in the global economy also caused problems.
[02:14.40]About half of all TB patients and their families
[02:18.32]face high costs for their treatments.
[02:21.52]WHO called for more countries
[02:24.76]to cover all TB diagnosis and treatment costs.
[02:29.32]After COVID-19, TB is the world's deadliest infectious disease.
[02:35.72]It is caused by bacteria that usually affect the lungs.
[02:40.80]The germs are mostly spread from person to person in the air,
[02:45.72]such as when an infected person coughs.
[02:49.12]TB mostly affects adults,
[02:52.00]especially those who do not have enough food
[02:55.32]or have other health conditions like HIV.
[02:59.64]More than 95 percent of TB cases are in developing countries.
[03:05.24]A WHO report said only one in three people
[03:09.72]with drug-resistant TB are receiving treatment.
[03:13.68]Dr. Hannah Spencer is with Doctors Without Borders in South Africa.
[03:19.36]Spencer said, "Drug-resistant TB is curable, but alarmingly,
[03:25.80]cases are on the rise for the first time in years."
[03:30.24]She added, "It's urgent that shorter, safer
[03:34.40]and more effective treatments are scaled up now."
[03:38.00]Spencer called for lowering the price of TB treatments
[03:42.40]so a complete treatment costs no more than $500.
[03:48.68]WHO also said conflicts in Eastern Europe, Africa
[03:53.68]and the Middle East have worsened the choices for patients
[03:58.00]seeking TB diagnosis and treatment.
[04:02.16]Ukraine had one of the world's worst TB epidemics
[04:06.20]even before Russia invaded the country in February.
[04:10.36]Health experts fear the inability of patients to get treated
[04:14.92]could fuel the rise of more drug-resistant TB
[04:18.72]across Ukraine and surrounding countries.
[04:22.84]While TB patients can seek care in Ukraine,
[04:26.52]the country has seen a shortage of important medicines.
[04:30.80]Officials also have a hard time following the progress of patients.
