<div class="content">Former Pink Floyd musician David Gilmour sold his guitar collection last month for $21.5 million at an auction to raise money for needy organizations. The collection included his well-known "Black Strat" Fender Stratocaster. It was sold for nearly $4 million to the owner of a U.S. National Football League team.上个月，平克·弗洛伊德乐队前乐手大卫·吉尔摩在一场拍卖会上以2150万美元的价格卖出了他的吉他珍藏，以便为有需要的组织筹集资金。这些藏品包括他那把著名的“Black Strat” 芬达初投者吉他。这把吉他以近400万美元的价格卖给了美国国家橄榄球联盟某球队的老板。
