<p>Potkey said she enjoys helping children play sports. But, there is one problem: space. The donations take up an entire room in her home.</p>
<p>She said she hopes to someday do the aid work full time.</p>
<p>"I feel like there's so much more need that I could help," Potkey said.</p>

[00:00.04]Rhiannon Potkey writes about sports for a newspaper in Tennessee.
[00:06.72]She learned through that work that some young people
[00:11.24]did not have good sports equipment, or gear.
[00:15.76]She decided to do something about it.
[00:19.32]Potkey started an aid group called Goods4Greatness.
[00:24.64]The charity connects teams and children
[00:28.12]who need sports equipment with donors.
[00:31.44]Like Aubree Munro.
[00:35.00]Munro is a player on the U.S.A. Women's softball team.
[00:40.48]She was hoping to compete at the Olympics in Japan last year.
[00:47.12]When the event was delayed because of the coronavirus pandemic,
[00:52.08]Munro started cleaning out her home in Florida.
[00:56.36]She realized she had a lot of extra sports equipment.
[01:01.28]Munro had heard about Potkey's organization.
[01:05.40]So she sent pictures of the gear she no longer needed.
[01:10.44]Potkey helped find people in Florida
[01:13.56]who could use the softball equipment.
[01:16.92]Munro said by making the donation, she was "paying it forward."
[01:23.08]This means to do good for someone
[01:26.72]as a thanks for the help other people give you.
[01:30.44]One person who got some of her softball equipment
[01:34.12]was a girl who reminded Munro of herself when she was young.
[01:40.88]"That one was particularly special," she said.
[01:45.16]"I had a lot of people do really great things for me
[01:49.32]when I was growing up."
[01:51.72]Munro said doing something nice for a stranger made her feel good.
[01:58.36]Many people have donated to Goods4Greatness.
[02:02.36]The softball team at Duke University
[02:05.80]in Durham, North Carolina donated used equipment.
[02:11.12]Former U.S. Women's Soccer star Julie Foudy
[02:15.68]donated 100 soccer balls.
[02:19.32]Colleges in states including Georgia,
[02:22.48]California and Colorado sent equipment, too.
[02:27.44]The U.S. is a big place.
[02:30.32]Potkey said her group saves on expenses
[02:34.36]by finding donors in the same areas as those who need the equipment.
[02:41.36]Jarrett Walls is the tennis coach
[02:44.68]at a high school near Raleigh, North Carolina.
[02:47.68]He said many of his players never would have tried the sport
[02:53.76]if it had not been for the donation from Potkey's charity.
[02:59.36]Last year, he said, only seven girls tried to play tennis.
[03:04.64]This year, he has about 30.
[03:08.32]Potkey said she enjoys helping children play sports.
[03:13.56]But, there is one problem: space.
[03:18.28]The donations take up an entire room in her home.
[03:23.04]She said she hopes to someday do the aid work full time.
[03:30.16]"I feel like there's so much more need
[03:34.00]that I could help," Potkey said.
