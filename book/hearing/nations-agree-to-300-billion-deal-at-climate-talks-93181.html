。
[00:02.04]Countries from around the world
[00:04.08]recently agreed to provide $300 billion
[00:08.16]to support poor nations
[00:10.32]in the face of climate change.
[00:13.64]The agreement reached on November 24
[00:17.08]at the United Nations climate talks in Azerbaijan
[00:21.20]left many unsatisfied.
[00:24.68]But some were hopeful
[00:26.44]that it would be a step in the right direction.
[00:30.40]The final deal says that rich countries
[00:33.40]have agreed to collectively provide
[00:36.04]at least $300 billion a year by 2035.
[00:42.44]The amount is much smaller than the $1.3 trillion
[00:46.92]that developing nations were asking for
[00:50.40]and that experts said was needed.
[00:54.92]Chandni Raina is India's negotiator at the climate talks.
[01:00.88]She told The Associated Press
[01:03.36]that the amount of money in the deal was very small.
[01:07.92]She said, "I'm sorry to say we cannot accept it."
[01:12.80]Nigeria's Nkiruka Maduekwe,
[01:16.04]head of the National Council on Climate Change,
[01:19.48]called the deal an insult and a joke.
[01:24.00]Ani Dasgupta is head of the environmental organization
[01:28.40]World Resources Institute.
[01:31.68]Dasgupta called it "an important down payment
[01:35.12]toward a safer, more equitable future."
[01:38.96]However, he added that the poorest countries
[01:42.00]are "rightfully disappointed"
[01:44.32]that wealthy nations did not offer more money
[01:47.20]with billions of lives at risk.
[01:50.60]The meeting went on longer than expected
[01:53.68]because of serious divisions
[01:55.84]and strong disagreements among countries.
[01:59.84]But delegations who feel more hopeful
[02:02.52]about the agreement
[02:04.16]said this deal is headed in the right direction,
[02:07.44]with hopes that more money
[02:09.32]will come in the future.
[02:12.00]Eamon Ryan, Ireland's environment minister,
[02:15.80]called the agreement "a huge relief."
[02:19.76]He said in a time of division and war,
[02:23.24]"the fact that we could get it through
[02:25.52]in these difficult circumstances is really important."
[02:29.64]The final agreement includes a call
[02:33.04]for parties to work together
[02:35.08]using "all public and private sources"
[02:38.08]to get closer to the $1.3 trillion per year goal by 2035.
[02:46.16]That means also pushing for large
[02:48.56]international banks to help pay the bill.
[02:52.60]And it means, hopefully,
[02:54.88]that companies and private investors
[02:58.16]will follow by spending their money toward climate action.
[03:03.64]The agreement also calls for developing countries
[03:07.16]that receive money to limit
[03:10.12]or cut the release of heat-trapping gases.
[03:14.44]Those targets are to be set early next year.
[03:17.76]They are part of the plan to keep cutting pollution
[03:21.92]with new targets every five years,
[03:24.64]which the world agreed to
[03:26.64]at the U.N. talks in Paris in 2015.
[03:31.36]The money will pay for the move away from fossil fuels
[03:34.88]toward clean energy.
[03:37.68]It will go to countries hard hit by extreme weather
[03:41.68]to prepare for floods, storms and fires.
[03:46.44]It will also go toward improving a farming process
[03:50.16]to help them survive weather extremes.
[03:54.28]In areas hit regularly by severe storms,
[03:57.92]the money can help build stronger homes
[04:00.88]or help people move to safer places.
[04:05.12]The Philippines, for example, has been hit
[04:07.92]by six major storms in less than a month.
[04:11.80]Millions of people faced strong winds,
[04:14.80]rising waters and serious damage to homes,
[04:18.56]roads and bridges and farmland.
[04:23.04]Esther Penunia works with
[04:25.56]the Asian Farmers Association.
[04:29.00]She said many farmers
[04:30.60]had to deal with storm damage
[04:32.72]such as trees that will not produce fruit
[04:36.04]for months or years, or animals that died.
