[by:www.21voa.com]
[00:00.00]快捷键：S播放/暂停，A快退，D快进，W循环。
[00:00.04]A new study suggests that Venus
[00:04.20]likely never had water flowing on its surface.
[00:08.84]The research was based on data
[00:12.76]related to the chemical makeup
[00:15.48]of the planet's atmosphere.
[00:18.36]Scientists have long considered
[00:21.92]whether Venus once held liquid water,
[00:25.72]even possibly large oceans.
[00:29.16]Such research was based on the fact
[00:32.88]that Venus is like our own planet in many ways.
[00:38.04]It is a rocky planet similar
[00:40.84]in structure and size to Earth
[00:43.88]and is also our closest planetary neighbor.
[00:48.84]But the latest study provides evidence
[00:52.80]that Venus has likely always been the hot,
[00:56.96]extremely dry planet it remains today.
[01:02.08]Researchers from Britain's
[01:05.00]University of Cambridge led the study.
[01:08.88]It recently appeared in the publication
[01:12.76]Nature Astronomy.
[01:15.04]The researchers' data examinations
[01:19.24]led them to conclude that both the surface
[01:23.52]and interior of Venus remain dry.
[01:27.84]The team said the strongest evidence that Venus
[01:32.60]once had large amounts of water
[01:35.32]would be the discovery of some water
[01:38.56]inside the planet today.
[01:41.16]But the study provided no evidence of that.
[01:45.84]Since water is considered
[01:48.52]an important element for supporting life,
[01:51.80]the researchers also suggest that Venus
[01:55.96]was likely never habitable,
[01:58.96]or able to support life.
[02:02.00]The lead writer of the study
[02:04.84]was Tereza Constantinou,
[02:07.96]a doctoral student at the University
[02:10.92]of Cambridge's Institute of Astronomy.
[02:15.08]She told Reuters news agency,
[02:18.60]"We suggest that a habitable past
[02:22.16]would be associated with Venus'
[02:25.32]present interior being water-rich,
[02:28.60]and a dry past with Venus'
[02:31.64]present interior being dry."
[02:34.92]The researchers explained they attempted
[02:39.28]to measure the current destruction rate
[02:42.20]of molecules in water, carbon dioxide
[02:46.60]and carbonyl sulfide in Venus' atmosphere.
[02:50.96]The state of the planet's atmosphere
[02:54.20]is linked to volcanic activity, the team said.
[02:59.16]"Volcanism, through its supply of gases
[03:03.36]to the atmosphere, provides a window
[03:06.52]into the interior of rocky planets like Venus,"
[03:10.96]the researchers wrote in a statement.
[03:14.36]"As magma rises from the mantle to the surface,
[03:18.96]it releases gases
[03:21.20]from the deeper portions of the planet.
[03:24.36]Volcanic explosions, or eruptions,
[03:28.76]can provide information on the amount of water
[03:32.88]contained deep below a planet's surface,
[03:37.12]the scientists said.
[03:40.00]On Earth, for example,
[03:42.24]volcanic eruptions mostly release steam,
[03:46.60]a vapor created when water gets heated.
[03:50.36]Measurements of volcanic gases on Earth
[03:54.68]have shown they release about
[03:57.16]60 percent water vapor.
[04:00.08]But the researchers said their examinations
[04:04.32]suggested volcanic gases released on Venus
[04:08.96]were less than 6 percent water vapor.
[04:12.96]This persuaded the team to conclude
[04:16.60]that the planet's interior
[04:18.88]– the source of the magma
[04:20.80]that releases volcanic gases
[04:23.48]– must be very dry.
[04:26.44]The team noted that scientists
[04:30.20]have had two leading theories
[04:32.76]on the history of water on Venus.
[04:36.12]The first is that the planet
[04:39.04]had a moderate climate for billions of years,
[04:42.80]with liquid water flowing over areas of the surface.
[04:47.68]Over time, widespread volcanic activity
[04:52.00]likely led to extreme heat and dry conditions
[04:56.52]that made the water disappear.
[04:59.72]The second theory imagined Venus
[05:03.24]as being very hot from the beginning,
[05:06.36]preventing liquid water
[05:08.52]from ever forming on the surface.
[05:11.72]Constantinou said, "Both of those theories
[05:16.40]are based on climate models,
[05:19.04]but we wanted to take a different approach
[05:22.16]based on observations of
[05:24.64]Venus' current atmospheric chemistry."
[05:28.56]She added that the team did not find evidence
[05:33.20]that any chemicals being removed
[05:35.84]from the atmosphere were later being restored.
[05:40.44]This provides strong evidence that Venus
[05:44.32]has a very dry interior today,
[05:47.48]the scientists concluded.
[05:50.28]"The atmospheric chemistry suggests
[05:54.28]that volcanic eruptions on Venus
[05:57.40]release very little water,
[05:59.92]implying that the planet's interior
[06:03.16]...is equally dry," Constantinou said.
[06:07.40]She added that her team
[06:10.28]"would have loved to find that Venus
[06:13.52]was once a planet much closer to our own."
[06:17.40]However, Constantinou noted
[06:20.44]the finding suggests that researchers
[06:23.92]should center their searches
[06:26.60]"on planets that are mostly likely
[06:29.60]to be able to support life
[06:32.00]– at least life as we know it."
