<p>He said people who work in movies have their <strong>stock-in-trade</strong>, or their special qualities that make them different from another actor.

Crabtree-Ireland wants to be sure actors keep making money from their special qualities.</p>
<p>For example, the labor organization wants to prevent movie production companies from taking an actor's image in one movie and using it to create a "digital double" for a new movie.</p>

[00:00.00]Leaders of the SAG-AFTRA actors' union 
[00:04.70]say the group's members are concerned 
[00:08.00]that they will lose work because of Artificial Intelligence, or AI, tools.
[00:16.03]The labor organization started talks 
[00:19.71]with Hollywood movie studios about a new contract this week.
[00:26.01]Duncan Crabtree-Ireland is the main person 
[00:30.54]speaking with movie studios on behalf of the actors. 
[00:35.51]He is SAG-AFTRA's negotiator.
[00:38.98]He said people who work in movies have their stock-in-trade, 
[00:44.79]or their special qualities that make them different from another actor. 
[00:51.23]He listed an actor's name, voice, personality 
[00:56.11]and likeness when describing those qualities. 
[01:00.71]Crabtree-Ireland wants to be sure actors 
[01:04.81]keep making money from their special qualities.
[01:09.60]For example, the labor organization 
[01:13.21]wants to prevent movie production companies 
[01:16.76]from taking an actor's image in one movie 
[01:20.87]and using it to create a "digital double" for a new movie.
[01:27.15]Crabtree-Ireland said it would not be fair to do that 
[01:33.28]without paying extra.
[01:35.72]Artificial intelligence tools have already been used 
[01:40.53]to make "deepfakes" of well-known actors Tom Cruise 
[01:45.59]and Keanu Reeves.
