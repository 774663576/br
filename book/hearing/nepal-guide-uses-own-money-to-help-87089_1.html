<div class="content">Crowds of foreign visitors usually enjoy the scenic trails in Nepal's Himalayan mountains. But for more than a year, the trails have been empty. And most of the country's tourism industry is still shut down by the pandemic.
成群结队的外国游客通常喜欢走在尼泊尔喜马拉雅山脉风景优美的小路上。但是这一年多来，小路上一直空空荡荡。该国大部分旅游业仍因为大流行而停业。
<p>That means tens of thousands of Sherpa guides have been left without the work needed to feed their families. Ang Phurba Sherpa has been trying to help those struggling the most during the pandemic. He told the Associated Press that he also hopes his actions lead others to do the same.
这意味着数以万计的夏尔巴向导失去了养家糊口所需的工作。昂普巴·夏尔巴一直在努力帮助大流行期间最艰难的那些人。他对美联社表示，他希望自己的行为能够引发他人效仿。</p>
<p>Sherpa has been loading his truck with large bags of rice, lentils, cooking oil and other necessities. He bought the food supplies with his own money and delivers them himself to many families in Kathmandu.<br/>
昂普巴一直在给他的卡车上装大袋的大米、扁豆、食用油和其它必需品。他用自己的钱购买了这些食品，然后亲自分发给加德满都的许多家庭。</p>
<p>Sherpa told reporters: "I am trying to help in any way I can because I thought I should give to our community ..."<br/>
昂普巴告诉记者：“我在尽我所能提供帮助，因为我认为我应该回报我们的社区。”</p>
<p>He adds that the guides have no work and need help. Nepal normally has two trekking seasons each year — spring and autumn. That is when the majority of foreigners come to hike the trails that cut through the country's snow-covered mountains.<br/>
他还表示，这些导游没有工作并且需要帮助。尼泊尔每年通常有两个徒步旅游季：春季和秋季。大多数外国人在那时候来到该国徒步穿越白雪覆盖的山脉。</p>
<p>In 2019, about 171,000 tourists visited Nepal to trek. They paid for hiking guides, ate in restaurants, slept at inns, and bought equipment. In 2020, there were hardly any tourists. It is the same again this year.<br/>
2019年，大约有17.1万名游客前往尼泊尔徒步。他们付钱雇佣登山向导，到餐馆吃饭，进旅馆睡觉，并且购买各种设备。2020年游客罕至。今年也是如此。</p>
<p>Nepal reopened to tourists in March, but only a few hundred foreigners have come. Also, they come to climb the country's famous mountains, such as Mount Everest, and not to trek.<br/>
尼泊尔在今年3月重新对游客开放，但是只有几百名外国游客来。此外，他们来是为了攀登该国的珠穆朗玛峰之类的名山，而不是来徒步。</p>
<p>"The guides are facing lots of trouble and they are in pain..." Sherpa said.<br/>
昂普巴表示：“向导们面临诸多困难，他们过得很煎熬。”</p>
<p>As a trekking guide himself, he said he is also in "a difficult situation." But he said he wants to help his fellow guides and hopes they will "come out to help each other." Their situation has been made worse by a new lockdown that started in April as cases of the COVID-19 virus increased in the area.<br/>
昂普巴自己也是徒步向导，他说他也处于困境。但是他表示，他想要帮助他的同事们，并希望他们站出来互相帮助。随着该地区新冠病毒病例的攀升，四月份开始的新一轮封锁使他们的状况变得更糟。</p>
<p>Sherpa has helped Kunjun Lama, another guide. He has been struggling to feed his family of six. He said the rice and oil he received would help his family for a month.<br/>
昂普巴帮助了另一位向导Kunjun Lama。他一直在努力养活他的一家六口。他说，他收到的大米和食用油可以帮助他的家人过上一个月。</p>
<p>"It has been two years and I have had not had any trekking guide work," Lama said. He added that "the worst part is there is no other work available at all right now."<br/>
Lama表示：“我已经有两年没有干过任何徒步向导工作。”他还表示：“更糟糕的是现在根本没有其它工作可以干。”</p>
<p>As well as helping his fellow guides, for the past three months Sherpa has been taking food to a shelter for 57 disabled children.<br/>
除了帮助其他向导，过去三个月里，昂普巴一直在为57名残疾儿童提供食物。</p>
<p>Shelter operator Dendi Sherpa said the main source of money had been his own pay from guide work. Without that, he had been struggling to run the shelter.<br/>
庇护所运营者丹迪·夏尔巴表示，这里的主要资金来源是他自身通过向导工作获取的报酬。没有这些报酬，他一直在艰难地运营着这个庇护所。</p>
<p>"But with help like this we are able to feed the children," he said.<br/>
丹迪表示：“但是有了这样的帮助，我们就能养活这些孩子们。”</p>
