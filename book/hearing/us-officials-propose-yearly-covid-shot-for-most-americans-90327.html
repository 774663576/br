[00:00.04]U.S. health officials are proposing that most American adults
[00:05.60]and children should receive a single,
[00:09.72]yearly COVID-19 vaccine shot.
[00:13.56]The plan, put forward by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA),
[00:20.56]would remove the need for people to get a series of injections
[00:25.68]and boosters throughout the year to stay protected.
[00:31.28]The proposal was announced as vaccine rates
[00:35.08]in the U.S. have dropped sharply.
[00:38.64]About 80 percent of Americans
[00:41.88]have had at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose.
[00:47.20]But only 16 percent of vaccine candidates
[00:51.80]have received the latest boosters that were approved in August.
[00:58.32]The FDA will ask an outside group of vaccine experts
[01:04.64]to consider its proposal during a meeting on Thursday.
[01:10.00]In documents published online, FDA scientists
[01:15.68]say many Americans now have "preexisting immunity" against COVID-19.
[01:24.60]This immunity came either from being vaccinated
[01:29.60]or infected, or a combination of the two.
[01:34.52]The FDA says that level of immunity
[01:38.92]should provide enough protection for most Americans
[01:43.84]to move to a yearly booster shot against the latest virus versions.
[01:51.16]A similar yearly vaccination system
[01:54.72]is already in place in the U.S. for influenza, or flu.
[02:01.16]The highly spreadable viral infection
[02:05.00]often affects people during the cold season.
[02:09.88]The FDA noted that for adults with weakened immune systems
[02:15.28]and very small children, a two-dose combination
[02:19.76]may be needed for protection against COVID-19.
[02:25.00]Scientists and vaccine companies plan to study vaccination
[02:31.68]and infection rates and other data
[02:35.28]to decide who should receive a single or two-dose shot.
[02:40.76]The FDA will also ask its experts
[02:45.60]to vote on whether all vaccines should target
[02:49.76]the same virus versions, called strains.
[02:54.44]That step would be needed to take away the booster shot system.
[03:00.96]The first shots launched by Pfizer and Moderna
[03:05.88]targeted the strain of the virus that began spreading
[03:10.56]in 2020 and quickly traveled across the world.
[03:15.52]The latest boosters launched last autumn
[03:19.68]were changed to target later strains that appeared.
[03:24.28]The FDA's proposal calls for the agency,
[03:29.20]independent experts and manufacturers
[03:33.24]to decide which strains to target by early summer each year.
[03:39.64]This would leave several months for vaccine makers
[03:44.24]to produce and launch new shots before the autumn.
[03:49.20]That is about the same system
[03:52.60]long used to administer the yearly flu shot.
[03:57.88]FDA officials say moving to a yearly COVID-19 vaccine plan
[04:05.48]would make it easier to publicize future vaccination campaigns.
[04:11.64]This could help increase vaccination rates nationwide.
[04:17.76]The first two-dose COVID shots have offered strong protection
[04:23.84]against severe disease and death
[04:26.92]no matter what strain people were infected with.
[04:31.08]But the vaccines have proven to be less effective
[04:35.56]against mild infection cases.
[04:39.12]Experts continue to debate whether the latest boosters
[04:44.80]have effectively improved protection,
[04:48.28]especially for younger and generally healthy Americans.
