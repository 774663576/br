。
[00:01.08]Fabrizio Cardinali, age 72,
[00:04.84]says he has no use for electricity.
[00:08.40]For more than fifty years, he has lived
[00:11.96]entirely off the public electricity network, or grid.
[00:17.36]That makes him one of the few people in Europe
[00:20.88]unconcerned about rising energy costs this winter.
[00:25.80]Cardinali lives in a stone house near Ancona,
[00:30.08]on Italy's eastern Adriatic coast.
[00:34.24]By choice, he has no electricity,
[00:37.52]no gas, and no indoor plumbing.
[00:41.32]"I was not interested in being part of the world as it was going.
[00:46.80]So I left everything - family, university, friends, the sports team,
[00:54.04]and set off in a completely different direction," he said.
[00:58.52]"You give something up to obtain something else
[01:02.12]that is more important," he said.
[01:04.88]In the past, he lived alone.
[01:08.72]Right now, he has two people who live with him,
[01:12.56]as well as animals such as a rooster, chickens and a cat.
[01:18.44]He calls the small community
[01:21.04]"The Tribe of the Harmonious Walnuts."
[01:24.56]Harmonious means having parts that are related
[01:27.92]or combined in a pleasing way.
[01:30.96]But it can also mean not experiencing disagreement or fighting.
[01:36.36]Cardinali and his friends,
[01:38.92]who gave their names only as Agnese and Andrea,
[01:43.04]use a wood-burning stove for cooking and warmth.
[01:47.40]They read by lamps fueled with used cooking oil
[01:51.88]that is given to them by neighbors.
[01:55.76]"I feel privileged to have the freedom to choose my freedom,"
[02:00.08]said Agnese, 35, who moved in two years ago.
[02:05.16]Andrea, 46, spends the week there but goes home to Macerata,
[02:11.84]about 50 kilometers away, each weekend to look after his mother.
[02:17.60]The "harmonious walnuts" grow fruit and vegetables,
[02:21.80]olives to produce olive oil, and keep bees for honey.
[02:26.48]A local group sells them foods such as legumes,
[02:30.88]cereals and wheat, which they grind to make their own bread.
[02:36.48]When possible, they trade goods for things they need.
[02:41.24]Although some people have called him "the Hermit of Cupramontana,"
[02:46.08]Cardinali says he is not a hermit.
[02:50.00]A hermit is a person who lives in a simple way apart from others.
[02:55.52]Instead, Cardinali believes life is best lived in small communities.
[03:02.28]His first piece of advice for anyone who wants to follow his example is:
[03:08.04]"Throw away your so-called smart phone."
[03:11.40]Cardinali sometimes travels short distances to visit friends.
[03:16.80]He takes olives to a stone press to make oil,
[03:20.80]and walks or gets rides to the nearest town
[03:24.48]to have a coffee with local people or visit the doctor.
[03:29.32]"I've been living this way for about 51 years
[03:32.68]and I have never regretted it," he said.
[03:36.40]Cardinali added, "there have been difficulties,
[03:40.28]but they never made me think that I made the wrong choice ...."
