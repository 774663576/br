。
[00:00.04]In 2017, a workplace accident
[00:05.00]resulted in Phil Durst losing sight in his left eye.
[00:11.44]He experienced severe pain from the incident
[00:15.00]which left him unable to tolerate light.
[00:19.40]He also experienced severe headaches four or five times a day.
[00:26.20]Then he underwent an experimental operation
[00:31.20]that aims to treat severe injuries
[00:34.72]in one eye with stem cells from the other eye.
[00:40.84]Durst said he went from being completely blind
[00:45.08]to seeing well enough to drive.
[00:48.84]Regaining his sight was an emotional experience
[00:53.52]for the 51-year-old from Homewood, Alabama.
[00:59.00]Durst was one of four patients to get stem cell transplants
[01:04.84]as part of the first study
[01:07.84]to test the method in the United States.
[01:12.88]Although additional treatment is needed,
[01:16.64]experts say the stem cell transplant
[01:20.20]offers hope to people
[01:22.64]who are not getting results from other methods.
[01:27.60]The experimental research results
[01:30.92]were published recently in Science Advances.
[01:36.36]A larger study is underway.
[01:39.60]The operation is designed to treat "limbal stem cell deficiency."
[01:47.08]It is a disorder of part of the eye called the cornea.
[01:52.92]The problem happens after chemical burns and other injuries.
[01:59.12]Limbal cells are needed to keep
[02:01.80]the outer surface of the cornea healthy.
[02:06.36]Patients without limbal cells cannot have corneal transplants
[02:12.08]that are commonly used to improve sight.
[02:16.52]Dr. Ula Jurkunas is an ophthalmologist
[02:21.72]at the treatment center Mass Eye and Ear in Boston, Massachusetts.
[02:29.16]She was the main researcher for the study.
[02:32.88]She said the experimental method
[02:36.64]involves taking a few stem cells from the healthy eye,
[02:41.08]then expanding them and growing them on a graft.
[02:46.68]The research took place at a laboratory
[02:50.16]at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston.
[02:55.36]A few weeks later, the grafts are transplanted into the injured eye.
[03:02.16]Durst was the first patient to undergo the operation.
[03:08.24]"The great part of it is that we're using a patient's own tissue,"
[03:13.68]not donor tissue the body might reject, Jurkunas said.
[03:19.92]She said this method is better than a different operation
[03:24.44]that takes a very large piece of stem cells from a healthy eye
[03:29.60]for use on an injured eye –
[03:32.56]but risks damaging the good eye.
[03:36.32]Both of Durst's eyes were hurt in the accident.
[03:41.64]For six to eight months,
[03:43.56]his sight was so bad that his wife or son had to lead him around.
[03:50.28]But his right eye was less injured than his left one
[03:54.48]and could provide stem cells for the transplant.
[03:59.64]Jurkunas also works with Harvard Medical School.
[04:04.92]She said Durst's 2018 operation
[04:08.80]was the product of almost 20 years of research.
[04:14.72]She said the researchers were happy to finally do the operation.
[04:21.20]All patients in the study
[04:23.20]reported that their cornea surfaces improved to normal.
[04:29.04]Durst and another patient
[04:31.44]were then able to get transplants of man-made corneas.
[04:37.72]Two others reported improved sight
[04:40.92]with the stem cell transplant alone.
[04:44.96]A fifth patient did not receive the operation
[04:48.64]because the stem cells were not able to expand enough.
[04:53.88]Durst said the vision in his right eye
[04:56.96]is nearly normal but the vision in his left could improve.
[05:02.68]He will have another operation in September to correct it.
[05:08.00]Researchers are finishing the next step of the clinical trial,
[05:12.80]which includes 15 patients.
[05:16.36]Jurkunas estimates that 1,000 people in the U.S.
[05:21.08]could be helped every year by this sort of stem cell transplant.
[05:26.92]The treatment has also been studied in Japan.
[05:30.76]I'm Gregory Stachel.
