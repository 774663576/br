<p>The study is based on observations collected in December 2023 by the James Webb Space Telescope. The American space agency NASA operates the orbiting observatory.</p>
<p>Researchers combined the information from the James Webb with existing data to make new estimates for the exoplanet's mass and size. These suggest that LHS 1140 b is “a promising super-Earth ice or water world,” the University of Montreal <a class="wsw__a" href="https://exoplanetes.umontreal.ca/en/astronomers-find-surprising-ice-world-in-the-habitable-zone-with-webb-data/">said</a> in a statement.</p>
<p>Some past studies had suggested the exoplanet might be a gas giant, also known as a mini-Neptune. But the researchers said the new study provides evidence that LHS 1140 b is more likely a super-Earth, a rocky planet bigger than Earth.</p>
<p>The new research supports a NASA-led study from October 2023 that <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.nasa.gov/science-research/planetary-science/astrobiology/nasa-some-icy-exoplanets-may-have-habitable-oceans-and-geysers/">suggested</a> at least 17 observed exoplanets could hold oceans of liquid water. That study noted that sometimes water from these oceans likely breaks through large pieces of ice to form <strong>geysers</strong>.</p>
<p>Scientists had already identified LHS 1140 b as being within its star's “<strong>habitable</strong> zone.” Exoplanets found within this zone are believed to have temperatures that would permit water to exist in liquid form.</p>
<p>Measurements made by the James Webb data suggest the exoplanet “is less dense” than expected for a rocky, Earth-like body. The researchers estimated that 10 to 20 percent of LHS 1140 b's mass might be made up of water. The possibility of a large liquid ocean would be found on the side of the planet always facing the star that it orbits.</p>
<p>The new data collected by the James Webb showed the exoplanet might also have a nitrogen-rich atmosphere. This differs from earlier research that suggested a possible atmosphere that was mostly hydrogen.</p>
<p>Charles Cadieux is a doctoral student at the University of Montreal's Trottier Institute for Research on Exoplanets. He was the lead writer of the study.</p>
<p>Cadieux said in a statement, “Of all currently known temperate exoplanets, LHS 1140 b could well be our <strong>best bet</strong> to one day indirectly confirm liquid water on the surface of an <strong>alien</strong> world beyond our solar system.” He noted that if the study's findings can be confirmed, the data would represent “a major <strong>milestone</strong>” in the search for exoplanets that could possibly support life.</p>
<p>René Doyon is a project scientist at the University of Montreal. He helped lead the research.

<p>He estimated that at least one more year of observations will be needed “to confirm that LHS 1140 b has an atmosphere.”</p>
<p>The process of confirming whether carbon dioxide is present in the atmosphere and liquid water exists on the surface would likely require several years of observations, Doyon noted.</p>

<p>With further data collection and investigation, MacDonald noted there is a good possibility “we might just have found evidence of air on this world.”</p>

。
[00:00.04]Researchers say new telescope observations
[00:05.04]suggest an Earth-like planet
[00:08.28]outside our solar system
[00:11.04]may hold a large liquid ocean.
[00:14.80]The exoplanet is known as LHS 1140 b.
[00:22.92]Astronomers believe it sits about
[00:26.28]48 light years away from Earth.
[00:29.52]A light year is the distance light travels in a year
[00:35.04]– about 9.5 trillion kilometers.
[00:39.48]The research – led by astronomers
[00:43.32]at the University of Montreal in Canada
[00:46.80]– shows the possibility the exoplanet
[00:50.80]might hold the right conditions
[00:53.40]to support some form of life.
[00:56.36]A study explaining the findings recently appeared
[01:01.84]in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.
[01:05.80]The study is based on observations
[01:09.88]collected in December 2023
[01:13.68]by the James Webb Space Telescope.
[01:17.24]The American space agency NASA
[01:20.92]operates the orbiting observatory.
[01:24.68]Researchers combined the information
[01:29.12]from the James Webb with existing data
[01:33.24]to make new estimates
[01:35.48]for the exoplanet's mass and size.
[01:39.96]These suggest that LHS 1140 b
[01:45.88]is "a promising super-Earth ice or water world,"
[01:51.44]the University of Montreal said in a statement.
[01:55.92]Some past studies had suggested the exoplanet
[02:01.40]might be a gas giant, also known as a mini-Neptune.
[02:07.40]But the researchers said the new study
[02:11.44]provides evidence that LHS 1140 b
[02:17.00]is more likely a super-Earth,
[02:19.84]a rocky planet bigger than Earth.
[02:23.72]The new research supports a NASA-led study
[02:28.12]from October 2023 that suggested
[02:32.56]at least 17 observed exoplanets
[02:36.88]could hold oceans of liquid water.
[02:40.32]That study noted that sometimes water
[02:44.68]from these oceans likely breaks through
[02:48.32]large pieces of ice to form geysers.
[02:52.76]Scientists had already identified LHS 1140 b
[02:59.56]as being within its star's "habitable zone."
[03:04.48]Exoplanets found within this zone
[03:08.44]are believed to have temperatures that would
[03:11.80]permit water to exist in liquid form.
[03:15.92]Measurements made by the James Webb data
[03:20.08]suggest the exoplanet "is less dense"
[03:24.48]than expected for a rocky, Earth-like body.
[03:28.92]The researchers estimated that 10 to 20 percent
[03:34.16]of LHS 1140 b's mass might be made up of water.
[03:41.20]The possibility of a large liquid ocean
[03:45.04]would be found on the side of the planet
[03:48.28]always facing the star that it orbits.
[03:51.80]The new data collected by the James Webb
[03:55.88]showed the exoplanet might also have
[03:59.64]a nitrogen-rich atmosphere.
[04:02.52]This differs from earlier research that suggested
[04:07.52]a possible atmosphere that was mostly hydrogen.
[04:12.28]Charles Cadieux is a doctoral student
[04:16.32]at the University of Montreal's
[04:18.96]Trottier Institute for Research on Exoplanets.
[04:24.16]He was the lead writer of the study.
[04:27.80]Cadieux said in a statement,
[04:30.76]"Of all currently known temperate exoplanets,
[04:34.88]LHS 1140 b could well be our best bet
[04:41.60]to one day indirectly confirm liquid water
[04:45.56]on the surface of an alien world
[04:48.48]beyond our solar system."
[04:51.12]He noted that if the study's findings can be confirmed,
[04:56.44]the data would represent "a major milestone"
[05:00.60]in the search for exoplanets
[05:03.64]that could possibly support life.
[05:06.40]René Doyon is a project scientist
[05:11.20]at the University of Montreal.
[05:14.20]He helped lead the research.
[05:17.28]He said more observations will be needed
[05:21.12]to confirm the current study's findings.
[05:24.80]"The current hint of a nitrogen-rich atmosphere
[05:29.52]begs for confirmation with more data," Doyon said.
[05:35.12]He estimated that at least
[05:37.56]one more year of observations will be needed
[05:41.20]"to confirm that LHS 1140 b has an atmosphere."
[05:48.48]The process of confirming
[05:50.96]whether carbon dioxide is present in the atmosphere
[05:55.12]and liquid water exists on the surface
[05:58.84]would likely require several years
[06:01.36]of observations, Doyon noted.
[06:04.68]Ryan MacDonald is a NASA Sagan Fellow
[06:09.20]in the University of Michigan's Department of Astronomy
[06:13.60]who helped examine the James Webb data.
[06:17.28]He said, "This is the first time we have ever seen a hint
[06:23.48]of an atmosphere on a habitable zone rocky
[06:27.40]or ice-rich exoplanet."
[06:30.08]With further data collection and investigation,
[06:34.56]MacDonald noted there is a good possibility
[06:38.60]"we might just have found evidence
[06:41.60]of air on this world."
