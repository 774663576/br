<p><strong>Answer </strong></p>
<p>Hello Siyang!</p>
<p>This is a great question. Often these words are used as <strong>synonyms</strong>, but there are differences. Let's look at how we use these words and find some examples to help us understand.</p>
<p>Let's start with "country."</p>
<p>A "country" is an organized political unit. We often describe "countries" as "states," especially when talking about politics. Joshua Keating, a former editor for the website <em>Foreign Policy</em> says there are several things that are needed to become a country.</p>
<p>A country needs territory or land. Next, people living there must live there permanently. Then the international community must recognize the boundaries or borders of the country.</p>
<p>Next, the country must have full <strong>sovereignty</strong> or the freedom of rule and be recognized by other countries. Finally, a country is ruled by a government or political body.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of how to use "country" in a sentence.</p>
<p><em>There are no countries in Antarctica, but some countries like Chile and New Zealand have claimed areas of it.</em></p>
<p><em>I have been to several countries in Europe including Romania, Czechia, Estonia and Finland.</em></p>
<p><em>Even though The United States is made up of smaller units called "states," they are not sovereign countries and are not internationally recognized as such.</em></p>
<p><em>California is a state and has the world's 4th largest economy, but it is not a country.</em></p>
<p>We often use "country" and "state" as synonyms, especially to differentiate the other meaning of "country" as a place outside of a city that has fields, farmland, trees, or<strong> </strong>villages.</p>
<p><em>Regina enjoys going to the country on the weekends to visit her family's farm in West Virginia.</em></p>
<p>And now let's move onto "nation."</p>
<p>"Nation" has two different meanings. Firstly, a "nation" can describe the same thing as the word "country" or "state." Our VOA Word Book describes a "nation" as a "country" together with its political and social systems. Let's look at an example.</p>
<p><em>There are 193 nations that make up the international organization called The United Nations.</em></p>
<p><em>The nation of Argentina recently won the FIFA World Cup.</em></p>
<p>"Nation" also has another meaning. It is the people of an area who are connected by a common culture or<strong> </strong>identity.</p>
<p>Sometimes a "country" or "state" is represented by one "nation," called a "nation-state."</p>
<p><em>Japan, Finland, and even the United States are considered nation-states.</em></p>
<p>Not all "nations" of people have their own "country" or border of their land that is recognized internationally.</p>
<p>Examples of "nations" of people without their own "country" include: The Kurdish people and native or<strong> indigenous</strong> people like Native Americans.</p>
<p><em>The Kurdish nation lives throughout a region called Kurdistan, which is spread throughout five countries. Kurds have a common language and culture.</em></p>
<p><em>First Nations people are an indigenous nation group in Canada.</em></p>

[00:01.88]Hello! This week on Ask a Teacher,
[00:06.20]we will answer a question about the difference
[00:10.12]between "nation" and "country."
[00:14.68]Hi VOA Learning English,
[00:18.00]Could you please help and explain
[00:21.20]what the difference is in usage
[00:24.28]between "nation" and "country?"
[00:28.12]Thanks and regards,
[00:30.92]Siyang Hao
[00:34.00]Hello Siyang!
[00:35.92]This is a great question.
[00:39.08]Often these words are used as synonyms,
[00:44.28]but there are differences.
[00:47.56]Let's look at how we use these words
[00:51.12]and find some examples to help us understand.
[00:55.88]Let's start with "country."
[01:00.24]A "country" is an organized political unit.
[01:05.32]We often describe "countries" as "states,"
[01:09.60]especially when talking about politics.
[01:14.68]Joshua Keating, a former editor
[01:17.72]for the website Foreign Policy
[01:20.52]says there are several things
[01:23.00]that are needed to become a country.
[01:26.84]A country needs territory or land.
[01:31.44]Next, people living there must live there permanently.
[01:36.92]Then the international community
[01:39.72]must recognize the boundaries
[01:42.76]or borders of the country.
[01:46.28]Next, the country must have full sovereignty
[01:50.60]or the freedom of rule
[01:53.28]and be recognized by other countries.
[01:57.28]Finally, a country is ruled
[02:00.40]by a government or political body.
[02:04.96]Here are some examples of how to use "country" in a sentence.
[02:11.80]There are no countries in Antarctica,
[02:15.52]but some countries like Chile
[02:18.56]and New Zealand have claimed areas of it.
[02:23.60]I have been to several countries in Europe
[02:27.08]including Romania, Czechia, Estonia and Finland.
[02:35.04]Even though The United States is made up
[02:38.28]of smaller units called "states,"
[02:41.84]they are not sovereign countries
[02:44.48]and are not internationally recognized as such.
[02:48.84]California is a state
[02:52.32]and has the world's 4th largest economy,
[02:56.48]but it is not a country.
[03:00.20]We often use "country" and "state" as synonyms,
[03:04.92]especially to differentiate the other meaning of "country"
[03:10.44]as a place outside of a city
[03:13.96]that has fields, farmland, trees, or villages.
[03:20.44]Regina enjoys going to the country on the weekends
[03:24.88]to visit her family's farm in West Virginia.
[03:30.24]And now let's move onto "nation."
[03:33.60]"Nation" has two different meanings.
[03:37.16]Firstly, a "nation" can describe the same thing
[03:41.68]as the word "country" or "state."
[03:44.76]Our VOA Word Book describes a "nation" as a "country"
[03:50.76]together with its political and social systems.
[03:55.36]Let's look at an example.
[03:59.32]There are 193 nations that make up
[04:04.32]the international organization called The United Nations.
[04:09.64]The nation of Argentina
[04:12.92]recently won the FIFA World Cup.
[04:17.28]"Nation" also has another meaning.
[04:21.00]It is the people of an area who are connected
[04:25.64]by a common culture or identity.
[04:30.12]Sometimes a "country" or "state"
[04:33.16]is represented by one "nation," called a "nation-state."
[04:40.68]Japan, Finland, and even the United States
[04:45.60]are considered nation-states.
[04:49.56]Not all "nations" of people have their own "country"
[04:54.00]or border of their land that is recognized internationally.
[05:00.92]Examples of "nations" of people
[05:03.76]without their own "country" include: The Kurdish people
[05:07.76]and native or indigenous people like Native Americans.
[05:13.92]The Kurdish nation lives throughout a region called Kurdistan,
[05:19.52]which is spread throughout five countries.
[05:23.16]Kurds have a common language and culture.
[05:28.92]First Nations people are an indigenous nation group in Canada.
[05:35.88]Please let us know if these explanations
[05:39.32]and examples have helped you!
