<textarea id="lrc_content" name="textfield" style="display:none;">[ti:Experts Consider China's Proposed Development Bank]
[ar:Mario Ritter]
[al:Economics Repor]

[00:00.00]From VOA Learning English, this is the Economics Report.
[00:05.73]The United States has expressed concerns 
[00:09.95]about China's plan to create a new development bank for Asia. 
[00:15.22]U.S. officials say they have questions 
[00:19.01]about how the new bank's system of governance. 
[00:21.79]But some experts say opposition 
[00:25.23]to the new organization may not be a good idea.
[00:28.56]China and 20 other countries 
[00:32.29]launched the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank last month. 
[00:36.69]But some nations, including the United States, 
[00:40.69]wonder whether the bank meets international models 
[00:44.54]for governance and openness. 
[00:46.97]U.S. State Department official Jen Psaki 
[00:51.47]says openness would be important for such an organization.
[00:56.46]"Our view is that it would need to be done 
[00:59.71]in a transparent manner with a high level of - high standards, 
[01:03.70]and that's something that we've conveyed 
[01:05.94]to countries in the region, 
[01:07.03]that we've conveyed as well to the Chinese."
[01:09.27]She added that the United States is concerned 
[01:13.00]about the unclear nature of the bank. 
[01:15.59]Many critics see it as possible competitor 
[01:19.93]to existing institutions like the Asian Development Bank.
[01:25.01]Some observers say the U.S. opposition 
[01:29.88]to the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank is a mistake. 
[01:34.36]Richard Cronin directs the Southeast Asia Program 
[01:39.34]at the Henry L. Stimson Center, in Washington, DC.
[01:43.84]"Safeguards and accountability issues 
[01:47.48]are certainly valid issues, 
[01:48.72]but the other thing is it's the reality. 
[01:51.46]It's happening. So the U.S. can express concerns but, you know, 
[01:58.88]it's not very good international politics 
[02:03.23]to take a stance against the bank. 
[02:04.47]I mean, it's going to happen."
[02:06.18]The United States is not the only nation 
[02:08.86]to have reservations about the new development bank. 
[02:12.60]Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott 
[02:16.53]recently said his government would like to join. 
[02:20.11]But first, he said, 
[02:22.20]it needs the bank to have the kind of transparency found 
[02:26.78]in organizations such as the World Bank. 
[02:30.12]South Korea has said more consideration is needed 
[02:35.40]on the new bank's governance.
[02:37.39]Richard Cronin also says geopolitical considerations 
[02:43.59]are the biggest reason why the United States 
[02:47.14]and some of its allies have not joined the bank. 
[02:51.13]The U.S. and its traditional allies have heavily influenced 
[02:57.37]the international banking system for many years. 
[03:00.95]They have funded and worked through institutions 
[03:06.02]such as the World Bank and the Asia Development Bank. 
[03:10.76]For a long time, 
[03:13.51]China and other developing economies have said 
[03:17.37]they have little influence at Western-led development banks.
[03:22.35]Some observers say the United States should consider 
[03:27.97]joining the new bank instead of ignoring it. 
[03:31.31]Kenneth Lieberthal works at the Brookings Institution in Washington. 
[03:37.24]He formerly served as a special advisor to the president 
[03:42.06]during the administration of Bill Clinton.
[03:45.26]"I think we actually ought to get engaged with this, 
[03:49.98]becoming a part of it, and try to, through that engagement, 
[03:54.16]both show the Chinese that we are prepared 
[03:57.25]to accept a greater role for them in areas 
[04:01.83]where they are contributing to public goods 
[04:03.92]and we want to work with them to have the standards 
[04:06.41]be standards that are necessary to sustain 
[04:10.14]the way the international system now functions."
[04:12.42]Mr. Lieberthal believes that 
[04:14.67]if the United States does not get involved, 
[04:17.70]it risks appearing unwilling to take steps to improve the area.
[04:23.28]And that's the VOA Learning English Economics Report.
