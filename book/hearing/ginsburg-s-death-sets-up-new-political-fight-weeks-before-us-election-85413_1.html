<div class="content">The death of a United States Supreme Court justice has set off a new political battle just six weeks before the nation's presidential election.
美国最高法院一位大法官在大选前6周去世引发了一场新的政治斗争。
<p>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died Friday night at her home in Washington, D.C. She was 87 years old.
大法官鲁斯·巴德·金斯伯格周五晚上在华盛顿的家中去世，享年87岁。</p>
<p>Over the weekend, crowds gathered near the Supreme Court building to remember the life of Ginsburg, who served over 27 years on the high court.<br/>
周末，人们聚集在最高法院大楼附近，缅怀曾在最高法院任职超过27年的金斯伯格的一生。</p>
<p>Some people brought flowers and pictures of the justice. One group performed the Christian hymn "Amazing Grace." Ginsburg was the first Jewish woman on the court. One sign read, "Today we mourn, tomorrow we fight."<br/>
有人带来了鲜花和这位大法官的照片。有人演唱了基督教赞美诗“Amazing Grace”。金斯伯格是最高法院的首位犹太女性。一个标语上写道：“今天我们哀悼，明天我们战斗。”</p>
<p>Weekend memorials also took place in other U.S. cities. In New York City's Brooklyn neighborhood, where Ginsburg was born, people gathered to remember her judicial work and lifelong public service.<br/>
美国其它城市周末也举行了纪念活动。在金斯伯格出生的纽约市布鲁克林区，人们聚在一起缅怀她的司法工作和终生公共服务。</p>
<p>Ginsburg was best known for her defense of the rights of women and minorities. She spent her final years on the Supreme Court as the unquestioned leader of its liberal wing.<br/>
金斯伯格以捍卫妇女和少数群体的权利而闻名。她在最高法院任职的最后几年成为了自由派毋容置疑的领导人。</p>
<p>After her death was reported, praise of Ginsburg appeared to come from all political sides, including the White House.<br/>
金斯伯格去世的报道出来之后，政界各方都对金斯伯格赞誉有加，其中也包括白宫在内。</p>
<p>In a statement, President Donald Trump said, "Her opinions, including well-known decisions regarding the legal equality of women and the disabled, have inspired all Americans, and generations of great legal minds."<br/>
川普总统在一份声明中表示：“她的观点，包括有关妇女和残疾人在法律上平等的那些众所周知的决定，激励了所有美国人以及一代又一代法律精英。”</p>
<p>His statement noted that Ginsburg had "demonstrated that one can disagree without being disagreeable."<br/>
他在声明中指出，金斯伯格证明了“一个人可以反对，但又不给人带来反感。”</p>
<p>Supreme Court justices are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. Some U.S. politicians were quick to express their opinion about moving forward with filling her seat on the high court.<br/>
最高法院大法官由总统提名并由参议院确认。一些美国政客迅速对推动填补金斯伯格在最高法院留下的空缺表达了观点。</p>
<p>Top Republican Party lawmakers are pressing for action on Ginsburg's replacement before the November 3 election. Democratic Party supporters want to delay the action until after the election, hoping their presidential candidate, Joe Biden, will win.<br/>
共和党高层议员督促在11月3日大选前采取行动取代金斯伯格。民主党支持者希望将行动推迟到大选之后，寄希望于他们的总统候选人拜登能够当选。</p>
<p>Trump, the Republican nominee, said on Monday he is considering a short list of candidates to replace Ginsburg. The president reportedly plans to announce his choice on Friday or Saturday.<br/>
共和党总统候选人川普周一表示，他正在考虑少数几位候选人来取代金斯伯格。据报道，川普计划在周五或周六宣布他的选择。</p>
<p>It will be Trump's third nominee to the Supreme Court since taking office in 2017. Ginsburg's death gives him the chance to shape a conservative majority that will likely influence the court's decisions for years to come.<br/>
这将是川普2017年上任以来提名的第三位最高法院大法官。金斯伯格的去世使他有机会形成保守派多数优势，这很可能会影响最高法院未来几年的裁决。</p>
<p>Trump rejected calls that the Republican-controlled Senate should wait to vote on a nominee until after the election. "The final vote should be taken before the election. We have plenty of time for that," he said.<br/>
川普拒绝了共和党控制的参议院应等到大选之后再对候选人进行投票的呼吁。他说：“应该在大选前进行最后表决。我们有足够时间这么做。”</p>
<p>Former Vice President Biden called Trump's plan for a quick vote to replace Ginsburg "an exercise of raw political power."<br/>
前副总统拜登称川普计划快速投票取代金斯伯格“是行使原始的政治权力。”</p>
<p>Trump has suggested he will nominate a woman and confirmed the names of two possibilities: Judge Amy Coney Barrett and Judge Barbara Lagoa. Barrett serves on the Chicago-based 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, while Lagoa is a federal district judge from Florida. Both are said to have taken right-leaning positions in court rulings.<br/>
川普表示他会提名一位女性，并确认了两位潜在人选：艾米·科尼·巴雷特法官和芭芭拉·拉古亚法官。巴雷特在芝加哥的美国第七巡回上诉法院任职，而拉古亚是来自佛罗里达州的一位联邦地方法官。据说两人在法院裁决中都持右倾立场。</p>
<p>Trump noted that Lagoa is a Hispanic-American from the politically important state of Florida. Lagoa, a Cuban-American, is "excellent, she's Hispanic, she's a terrific woman," Trump said. "We love Florida."<br/>
川普指出，拉古亚是来自政治重镇佛罗里达州的一位拉丁裔美国人。川普表示，拉古亚这位古巴裔美国人非常优秀，她是拉丁裔，是一位了不起的女人。我们爱佛罗里达。”</p>
<p>As the battle over the replacement process began, Reuters news agency noted a sharp rise in political donations from Democratic Party supporters. More than $90 million flowed from the donors in just over 24 hours, Reuters reported.<br/>
路透社指出，随着对取代程序的斗争打响，民主党支持者的政治捐款急剧增加。路透社报道称，短短24小时捐款人就捐出了超过9千万美元。</p>
<p>On the Republican side, Iowa Senator Joni Ernst's re-election campaign sent out an email shortly after Ginsburg's death was announced. "BREAKING: The future of the Supreme Court is on the line," the email read.<br/>
在共和党方面，爱荷华州参议员乔尼·恩斯特的连任竞选团队在金斯伯格去世被公开后不久发出了一份电邮。邮件写道：“突发新闻：最高法院的未来处在危险中。”</p>
<p>At a Trump campaign event in North Carolina, supporters shouted "fill that seat" when the president raised the issue of the open court seat. Speaking at the event Saturday, Paulette Fittshur told The Associated Press she believes Ginsburg's death "was God's perfect timing in this election." She called it "a golden opportunity for conservatives."<br/>
在北卡罗莱纳州的川普竞选活动上，当川普提到最高法院的席位空缺问题时，支持者大喊：“占上这个席位。”保莱特·菲茨瑟在周六的活动上对美联社表示，金斯伯格的去世是“这次大选中上帝的最好安排。”她称这是“保守派千载难逢的机会。”</p>
<p>But another Trump supporter, Chris Holmes, said a nomination fight is not what the country needs or what Republicans should take on before the presidential election.<br/>
但是另一位川普的支持者克里斯·霍尔姆斯表示，提名之争不是美国所需要的，也不是共和党在总统大选前应该采取的行动。</p>
<p>Holmes, a 58-year old engineer, also attended the North Carolina campaign event. Holmes said he was worried about what might happen after November 3 if the result is disputed or unclear: "Violence is coming," he warned.<br/>
58岁的工程师霍尔姆斯也参加了北卡罗莱纳州的竞选活动。霍尔姆斯表示，他担心在11月3日之后，如果竞选结果有争议或是优势不明显，可能会有事发生。他警告说：“暴力即将来临。”</p>

。
[00:00.04]The death of a United States Supreme Court justice
[00:04.72]has set off a new political battle
[00:08.36]just six weeks before the nation's presidential election.
[00:15.48]Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died Friday night
[00:20.28]at her home in Washington, D.C. She was 87 years old.
[00:27.64]Over the weekend, crowds gathered near the Supreme Court building
[00:32.88]to remember the life of Ginsburg, who served over 27 years on the high court.
[00:41.44]Some people brought flowers and pictures of the justice.
[00:47.04]One group performed the Christian hymn "Amazing Grace."
[00:53.36]Ginsburg was the first Jewish woman on the court.
[00:58.68]One sign read, "Today we mourn, tomorrow we fight."
[01:05.60]Weekend memorials also took place in other U.S. cities.
[01:11.68]In New York City's Brooklyn neighborhood, where Ginsburg was born,
[01:16.64]people gathered to remember her judicial work and lifelong public service.
[01:24.64]Ginsburg was best known for her defense of the rights of women and minorities.
[01:33.00]She spent her final years on the Supreme Court
[01:36.84]as the unquestioned leader of its liberal wing.
[01:42.04]After her death was reported, praise of Ginsburg
[01:46.28]appeared to come from all political sides, including the White House.
[01:52.96]In a statement, President Donald Trump said, "Her opinions,
[01:58.24]including well-known decisions regarding
[02:01.64]the legal equality of women and the disabled,
[02:05.92]have inspired all Americans, and generations of great legal minds."
[02:14.08]His statement noted that Ginsburg had "demonstrated
[02:18.80]that one can disagree without being disagreeable."
[02:24.60]Supreme Court justices are nominated by the president
[02:29.40]and confirmed by the Senate.
[02:33.20]Some U.S. politicians were quick to express their opinion
[02:38.00]about moving forward with filling her seat on the high court.
[02:44.08]Top Republican Party lawmakers are pressing for action
[02:48.80]on Ginsburg's replacement before the November 3 election.
[02:55.48]Democratic Party supporters want to delay the action until after the election,
[03:01.68]hoping their presidential candidate, Joe Biden, will win.
[03:08.12]Trump, the Republican nominee, said on Monday
[03:12.60]he is considering a short list of candidates to replace Ginsburg.
[03:18.52]The president reportedly plans to announce his choice on Friday or Saturday.
[03:26.64]It will be Trump's third nominee to the Supreme Court
[03:30.92]since taking office in 2017.
[03:35.36]Ginsburg's death gives him the chance to shape a conservative majority
[03:41.36]that will likely influence the court's decisions for years to come.
[03:47.84]Trump rejected calls that the Republican-controlled Senate
[03:52.44]should wait to vote on a nominee until after the election.
[03:58.08]"The final vote should be taken before the election.
[04:02.36]We have plenty of time for that," he said.
[04:07.64]Former Vice President Biden called Trump's plan for a quick vote
[04:12.88]to replace Ginsburg "an exercise of raw political power."
[04:19.68]Trump has suggested he will nominate a woman
[04:23.56]and confirmed the names of two possibilities:
[04:27.72]Judge Amy Coney Barrett and Judge Barbara Lagoa.
[04:34.16]Barrett serves on the Chicago-based 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals,
[04:40.56]while Lagoa is a federal district judge from Florida. B
[04:46.40]oth are said to have taken right-leaning positions in court rulings.
[04:53.64]Trump noted that Lagoa is a Hispanic-American
[04:57.92]from the politically important state of Florida.
[05:01.96]Lagoa, a Cuban-American, is "excellent, she's Hispanic,
[05:07.36]she's a terrific woman," Trump said. "We love Florida."
[05:13.72]As the battle over the replacement process began, Reuters news agency noted
[05:20.32]a sharp rise in political donations from Democratic Party supporters.
[05:27.12]More than $90 million flowed from the donors
[05:31.48]in just over 24 hours, Reuters reported.
[05:37.12]On the Republican side, Iowa Senator Joni Ernst's re-election campaign
[05:43.72]sent out an email shortly after Ginsburg's death was announced.
[05:49.96]"BREAKING: The future of the Supreme Court is on the line," the email read.
[05:57.32]At a Trump campaign event in North Carolina,supporters shouted "fill that seat"
[06:04.20]when the president raised the issue of the open court seat.
[06:09.20]Speaking at the event Saturday, Paulette Fittshur told The Associated Press
[06:15.36]she believes Ginsburg's death "was God's perfect timing in this election."
[06:22.04]She called it "a golden opportunity for conservatives."
[06:28.12]But another Trump supporter, Chris Holmes,
[06:31.64]said a nomination fight is not what the country needs
[06:36.32]or what Republicans should take on before the presidential election.
[06:43.32]Holmes, a 58-year old engineer, also attended the North Carolina campaign event.
[06:51.92]Holmes said he was worried about what might happen after November 3
[06:57.84]if the result is disputed or unclear: "Violence is coming," he warned.
