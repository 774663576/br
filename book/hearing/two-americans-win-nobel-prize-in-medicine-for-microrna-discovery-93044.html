<p>Fletcher said that microRNA provides genetic instructions that tell cells to make new proteins. “MicroRNA <strong>alters</strong> how genes in the cell work,” said Fletcher, who is not associated with the Nobel prize.</p>

。
[00:00.04]Two Americans have won
[00:02.96]the 2024 Nobel Prize
[00:05.64]in Physiology or Medicine
[00:08.12]for their discovery of genetic material
[00:11.72]called microRNA.
[00:15.32]Victor Ambros is a professor
[00:18.32]at the University of Massachusetts
[00:21.24]and Gary Ruvkun
[00:23.24]is a Harvard University professor.
[00:27.20]The Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institute,
[00:31.88]a group of 50 professors,
[00:34.72]decided to award the two
[00:37.44]for identifying genetic molecules
[00:40.92]that help control how genes work.
[00:45.16]The Nobel Assembly said the discovery is
[00:49.44]"proving to be fundamentally important
[00:53.04]for how organisms develop and function."
[00:58.00]In explaining the importance of the work,
[01:01.20]the group said it "revealed
[01:03.84]a completely new principle of gene regulation
[01:08.20]that turned out to be essential
[01:11.20]for multicellular organisms, including humans."
[01:18.48]RNA takes genetic information from DNA
[01:24.08]through a process called transcription.
[01:28.84]RNA then becomes involved in protein production
[01:34.36]or other activities within the cell.
[01:38.52]Ambros and Ruvkun found that microRNA,
[01:44.80]or very short chains of molecules,
[01:48.40]are needed for normal genetic development.
[01:53.32]The committee said changes in the way
[01:56.76]that microRNA functions
[02:00.04]can lead to major genetic changes,
[02:03.88]or mutations, over time.
[02:08.48]Nobel's website said
[02:10.84]the changes can lead to diseases
[02:14.04]such as cancer, diabetes
[02:17.32]and autoimmune diseases.
[02:21.52]Ambros carried out research that helped lead
[02:25.48]to the discovery at Harvard University.
[02:29.20]Ruvkun researched
[02:31.44]at Massachusetts General Hospital
[02:34.60]and Harvard Medical School.
[02:38.88]At first, Ambros and Ruvkun
[02:42.08]were interested in genes that control
[02:45.52]when genetic developments take place.
[02:49.56]These developments ensure
[02:52.04]that different kinds of cells
[02:54.48]develop at the right time.
[02:58.76]The scientists studied the genetic material
[03:02.72]of a one-millimeter-long worm C. elegans
[03:08.12]which is commonly used for research.
[03:12.60]They studied two mutant strains of worms
[03:17.24]that displayed defects in the timing of activation
[03:22.24]of genetic programs during development.
[03:27.72]They wanted to identify the mutated genes
[03:31.72]in the worms and what the genes did.
[03:36.96]After some time, they finally found
[03:40.32]that microRNA controlled the mutation.
[03:44.96]They also believe that this mutation
[03:49.32]has permitted organisms to change, or evolve,
[03:54.12]over hundreds of millions of years.
[03:58.96]Dr. Claire Fletcher is a cancer researcher
[04:03.48]with Imperial College London.
[04:06.88]Fletcher said the discovery of microRNA
[04:12.16]has opened new ways for treating cancer.
[04:17.40]Fletcher said that microRNA
[04:20.96]provides genetic instructions
[04:23.96]that tell cells to make new proteins.
[04:29.36]"MicroRNA alters
[04:32.00]how genes in the cell work," said Fletcher,
[04:36.60]who is not associated with the Nobel prize.
[04:41.92]"We can take a microRNA
[04:44.96]that we know alters the activity of that gene
[04:49.32]and we can deliver that particular microRNA
[04:54.32]to cancer cells to stop that mutated gene
[04:59.16]from having its effect," Fletcher added.
[05:04.56]Last year's Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology
[05:09.04]was also awarded for developments related to RNA.
[05:16.00]Hungarian-American Katalin Karikó
[05:20.32]and American Drew Weissman
[05:23.32]were recognized for discoveries
[05:26.36]that enabled messenger RNA,
[05:29.16]or mRNA, vaccines for COVID-19.
[05:36.32]The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine
[05:39.80]is valued at about $1 million.
[05:44.48]Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel
[05:47.60]established the Nobel Prizes
[05:50.72]to recognize important discoveries
[05:53.88]that have aided humanity.
[05:57.64]Thomas Perlmann is the Secretary-General
[06:01.72]of the Nobel Committee.
[06:03.76]He said it took a long time
[06:06.80]before Ruvkun came to the phone,
[06:10.20]but he was "happy,
[06:12.04]when he understood what it was all about."
