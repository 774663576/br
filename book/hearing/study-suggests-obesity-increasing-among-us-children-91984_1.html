。
[00:01.00]A new study adds to evidence
[00:03.20]that obesity is becoming more common
[00:06.40]in young children in America.
[00:09.56]The study appeared in the medical publication Pediatrics.
[00:14.08]The findings are similar to other national data,
[00:18.16]which suggests around 2.5 percent
[00:21.76]of all preschool-aged children
[00:24.36]were severely obese during the same period.
[00:28.20]One of the study's writers, Heidi Blanck
[00:32.00]of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
[00:36.68]said "We were doing well
[00:39.12]and now we see this upward trend....
[00:42.24]We are dismayed at seeing these findings."
[00:45.64]Dismayed is a term that means
[00:48.40]very worried or disappointed.
[00:51.00]The study looked at children ages 2 to 4
[00:55.52]who took part in the Women, Infants
[00:58.40]and Children (WIC) program.
[01:02.60]The program gives healthy foods and other services
[01:06.52]to preschool-aged children in low-income families.
[01:11.28]The children were weighed and measured.
[01:14.36]The researchers found that 2.1 percent of kids
[01:18.80]in the program were severely obese in 2010.
[01:23.68]Six years later, the rate had dropped to 1.8 percent.
[01:29.24]But by 2020, it was 2 percent.
[01:33.28]That amounts to about 33,000
[01:36.68]of more than 1.6 million kids in the WIC program.
[01:42.60]The study showed major increases in 20 states.
[01:46.92]California's was the highest at 2.8 percent.
[01:51.88]There also were large increases
[01:54.68]in some racial and ethnic groups.
[01:57.64]The highest rate, about 2.8 percent,
[02:01.32]was among Hispanic children.
[02:04.52]Experts say severe obesity at a very early age
[02:09.16]is nearly irreversible
[02:11.32]– meaning the damage is nearly impossible to undo.
[02:15.12]Severe obesity is strongly linked
[02:18.60]with health problems and an early death.
[02:22.60]It is not clear why the increase occurred, Blanck said.
[02:27.56]When WIC obesity rates dropped,
[02:30.00]some experts suggested 2009 policy changes
[02:34.68]might be responsible.
[02:36.80]Those changes took out juice from infant food packages,
[02:41.40]provided less saturated fat, and tried to make it easier
[02:46.00]for people to buy fruits and vegetables.
[02:49.28]The package has not changed.
[02:52.20]But "the daily hardships
[02:54.12]that families living in poverty are facing
[02:57.40]may be harder today than they were 10 years ago,
[03:00.96]and the slight increases in the WIC package
[03:04.44]just weren't enough," said Dr. Sarah Armstrong,
[03:08.64]a Duke University childhood obesity researcher.
[03:13.48]The researchers faced difficulties.
[03:16.52]The number of kids in WIC declined in the past ten years.
[03:21.72]And the study included 2020,
[03:24.96]the year the COVID-19 pandemic hit.
[03:28.32]At the time, fewer parents
[03:30.96]brought their children in to see doctors.
[03:34.24]That reduced the amount of complete information available.
[03:39.24]Despite its limitations, it was a "very well done study,"
[03:44.24]said Deanna Hoelscher,
[03:46.16]a childhood obesity researcher
[03:48.92]at the UTHealth Houston School of Public Health.
[03:53.28]She added, "It gives you a hint of what's going on."
[03:58.48]What has happened since 2020 is not yet known.
[04:02.52]Some small studies have suggested an increase
[04:05.16]in childhood obesity — especially during the pandemic.
[04:10.52]During the pandemic, kids were kept home from schools.
[04:15.08]Their eating and bedtime schedules
[04:17.76]were changed and physical activity decreased.
[04:22.20]"We are thinking it's going to get worse," Hoelscher said.
[04:27.24]I'm John Russell.
