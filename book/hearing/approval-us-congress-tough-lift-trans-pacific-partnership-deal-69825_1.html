[00:25.56]will pass in the U.S. Congress.
[00:29.44]Vietnam is one of the countries included in the TPP.
[00:34.80]But members of the U.S. Senate, which approves trade agreements, are not so sure.
[00:42.36]Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said
[00:48.08]the president was "overly optimistic" about passage of the deal.
[00:53.76]"There's been a sourness on trade" in Congress, he added.
[00:59.76]Democrats in the Senate also have voiced concerns.
[01:03.84]Chuck Schumer of New York called passing the TPP a "tough lift," or a difficult effort.
[01:14.60]Dick Durbin of Illinois pointed to the lack of support for the agreement
[01:20.37]among the candidates for president.
[01:24.28]"When you have the three leading presidential candidates of both parties opposing TPP,
[01:31.68]it's an indication that political sentiment is not in favor of the agreement," said Durbin.
[01:39.04]Democratic Party candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders,
[01:45.60]and Republican Party candidate Donald Trump, have said they oppose the TPP trade deal.
[01:54.04]Some labor unions, environment groups and human-rights groups also strongly oppose the deal.
[02:03.28]The TPP was created to reduce import taxes, such as tariffs,
[02:09.67]which are considered barriers to trade.
[02:13.40]It also puts in place rules for trade and enforcement.
[02:18.40]Partners include Japan, Canada, Australia, Mexico and Vietnam.

[02:48.31]"There are winners and losers in every trade deal," he said.
[02:53.96]Many problems linked to trade with China,
[02:57.44]such as job losses, have already taken place, he said.
[03:03.24]The TPP, he noted, does not deal with China trade.

[03:38.12]Hatch is not happy about the length of time U.S. companies
[03:42.64]would keep exclusive rights to their drug and biological products.
