<p>Let's hear some examples:</p>
<p><em>She works <u>like gangbusters</u> and gets the job done quickly. </em></p>
<p><em>The wildflowers are spreading <u>like gangbusters</u>.</em></p>
<p>We can use this expression to describe something that starts with a lot of <strong>enthusiasm</strong>. It can also mean someone or something is having great effect -- usually in a good way. Whatever the attempt is, it is successful.</p>
<p>To start something <u>like gangbusters</u> can also mean it involves great force or <strong>aggressiveness</strong>. For example, the partners worked <u>like gangbusters</u> to open their business before their <strong>rivals</strong> in the city.</p>
<p><u>Like gangbusters</u> can simply mean something is growing very fast. For example, if the economy is growing <u>like gangbusters,</u> it is growing very fast.</p>
<p>Sometimes we add the phrasal verb “come on,” making the expression <u>to come on like gangbusters.</u> The expression <u>to come on like gangbusters</u> can also mean to work hard and in an energetic, forceful manner to get something done.</p>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<p><em>When I gave the lesson to my students, they <u>came on like gangbusters</u> to try to solve the mystery.</em></p>
<p><em>The new employee <u>came on like gangbusters</u> during her first few months on the job. </em></p>
<p>But why <u>gangbusters</u>?</p>
<p>As a noun, <u>gangbuster</u> is a term for a law-enforcement officer who breaks up organized crime. <u>Gangbusters</u> often use forceful or aggressive means.</p>
<p>Word experts say the expression <u>like gangbusters</u> comes from a popular radio show called <em>Gang Busters</em> broadcast in the United States from 1935 to 1957. This crime-fighting radio drama started with a lot of noise and excitement – police sirens, screams, gun fire and exciting music.</p>
<p><u>Gangbuster</u> is also an adjective. It can describe something that is excellent or successful. For example, experts are reporting of a <u>gangbusters</u> housing market in rural areas.</p>
<p>It can also describe someone who is energetic or <strong>eager</strong> to do something. For example, if someone asks you to volunteer during the weekend you can say, “I'm not really <u>gangbusters</u> over that idea." However, this usage is not as common as <u>to come on like gangbusters.</u></p>
<p>And if you do not want to use <u>gangbusters</u>, you could say you <u>started something with a bang</u>. To <u>start or begin something with a bang </u>means you start in an exciting and noticeable way. You can also say to <u>be back with a bang.</u></p>
<p>Here's an example using that expression:</p>
<p><em>The singer took a year off. But with her new <strong>album</strong>, she's <u>back with a bang.</u></em></p>

。
[00:08.44]And now, Words and Their Stories,
[00:11.96]from VOA Learning English.
[00:19.36]With a new project, you may want to start
[00:22.80]with energy and excitement.
[00:25.72]If that is the case, you could say
[00:28.76]you want to start like gangbusters.
[00:33.28]To start like gangbusters means
[00:35.76]you start a project on the right foot
[00:38.96]– an exciting one!
[00:41.00]You begin with energy, speed,
[00:44.96]and sometimes, attention-getting success.
[00:49.92]Let's hear some examples:
[00:52.92]She works like gangbusters
[00:55.04]and gets the job done quickly.
[00:58.04]The wildflowers are spreading
[01:00.52]like gangbusters.
[01:03.20]We can use this expression to describe something
[01:06.36]that starts with a lot of enthusiasm.
[01:09.52]It can also mean someone or something
[01:13.72]is having great effect -- usually in a good way.
[01:18.84]Whatever the attempt is, it is successful.
[01:24.36]To start something like gangbusters
[01:27.28]can also mean it involves
[01:29.92]great force or aggressiveness.
[01:34.60]For example, the partners worked like gangbusters
[01:38.76]to open their business before their rivals in the city.
[01:44.24]Like gangbusters can simply mean
[01:46.76]something is growing very fast.
[01:49.80]For example, if the economy is growing
[01:53.20]like gangbusters, it is growing very fast.
[01:57.64]Sometimes we add the phrasal verb "come on,"
[02:01.28]making the expression to come on like gangbusters.
[02:06.80]The expression to come on like gangbusters
[02:09.92]can also mean to work hard and in an energetic,
[02:14.64]forceful manner to get something done.
[02:18.48]Here are some examples:
[02:20.96]When I gave the lesson to my students,
[02:24.24]they came on like gangbusters
[02:26.72]to try to solve the mystery.
[02:30.40]The new employee came on like gangbusters
[02:33.96]during her first few months on the job.
[02:39.44]But why gangbusters?
[02:42.12]As a noun, gangbuster is a term
[02:45.96]for a law-enforcement officer
[02:48.48]who breaks up organized crime.
[02:51.76]Gangbusters often use
[02:53.88]forceful or aggressive means.
[02:57.44]Word experts say the expression
[03:00.48]like gangbusters comes from
[03:02.60]a popular radio show called Gang Busters
[03:06.32]broadcast in the United States
[03:09.04]from 1935 to 1957.
[03:14.32]This crime-fighting radio drama
[03:16.84]started with a lot of noise and excitement
[03:20.76]– police sirens, screams,
[03:23.36]gun fire and exciting music.
[03:27.12]Gangbuster is also an adjective.
[03:30.00]It can describe something
[03:32.16]that is excellent or successful.
[03:34.88]For example, experts are reporting
[03:38.36]of a gangbusters housing market in rural areas.
[03:42.88]It can also describe someone
[03:45.40]who is energetic or eager to do something.
[03:48.80]For example, if someone
[03:51.24]asks you to volunteer during the weekend
[03:54.12]you can say,
[03:55.48]"I'm not really gangbusters over that idea."
[04:00.40]However, this usage is not as common
[04:03.96]as to come on like gangbusters.
[04:07.96]And if you do not want to use gangbusters,
[04:11.36]you could say you started something with a bang.
[04:15.64]To start or begin something with a bang
[04:19.48]means you start in an exciting
[04:22.92]and noticeable way.
[04:25.72]You can also say to be back with a bang.
[04:28.68]Here's an example using that expression:
[04:33.08]The singer took a year off.
[04:35.48]But with her new album,
[04:38.04]she's back with a bang.
[04:41.80]And that's end of this Words and Their Stories.
[04:44.68]Until next time, I'm Anna Matteo.
