。
[00:00.04]Arab Americans have long been a part
[00:03.60]of life in the United States.
[00:06.76]A small museum in Dearborn,
[00:10.08]Michigan is trying to tell their stories.
[00:14.08]Called the Arab American National Museum,
[00:18.08]it has an exhibit about Joseph Haggar.
[00:22.16]He was a Lebanese immigrant who founded
[00:25.32]Haggar's clothing company in 1926.
[00:30.40]Diana Abouali is the museum's director.
[00:35.64]Abouali said, "He settled in Texas,
[00:39.08]and he started this pant company
[00:41.72]that was extremely successful in the 20th century."
[00:46.68]She added, "He also revolutionized
[00:50.04]the way that pants and clothing were mass produced."
[00:55.88]Haggar came up with the word "slacks"
[00:58.96]to describe pants that people would wear while relaxing.
[01:05.16]His slacks were worn by many American men
[01:08.96]including the 36th U.S. president, Lyndon Johnson.
[01:15.68]Stories like Haggar's are important to the museum's mission
[01:20.60]to show how Arab Americans
[01:23.72]have been part of American life
[01:26.12]since the late 19th century.
[01:29.76]"We communicate the American narrative
[01:32.72]in the voices of Arab Americans.
[01:36.28]They express their experiences
[01:38.68]in their own words," Abouali said.
[01:42.64]"This provides people with a more authentic
[01:46.08]and real representation of what it means
[01:49.68]to be Arab American."
[01:53.08]The museum attempts to share
[01:55.32]the Arab American experience,
[01:57.60]including the path to America, home and work life,
[02:02.52]and service in the U.S. Armed Forces.
[02:07.80]The offerings include an exhibit
[02:10.76]about the hundreds of Syrian and Lebanese immigrants
[02:15.08]in North Dakota between 1890 and World War I.
[02:22.16]Thousands of their descendants
[02:24.20]still live in the north central state today.
[02:28.76]Another exhibit includes lists
[02:31.88]of Arab American passengers
[02:34.28]on the Titanic, which sank in 1912.
[02:40.00]The museum also tries to change
[02:42.76]religious misunderstandings.
[02:45.84]"Half of the Arab American community
[02:48.84]is Christian," Abouali said.
[02:51.84]"And in fact, the earlier immigrants,
[02:55.60]who came in the late 19th century,
[02:58.76]early 20th century, were predominantly Christian."
[03:04.48]A "wall of fame" shows other well-known Arab Americans.
[03:10.12]They include reporter Helen Thomas,
[03:13.72]known as the first woman
[03:15.64]to end a White House press conference by saying,
[03:19.04]"Thank you, Mr. President." Others are actress Kathy Najimy,
[03:25.00]former U.S. Secretary of Health
[03:27.64]and Human Services Donna Shalala,
[03:31.20]and Candace Lightner,
[03:33.96]who founded Mothers Against Drunk Driving in 1980.
[03:40.40]Stories of Arab immigrants
[03:42.80]are often misunderstood among Americans.
[03:47.64]Jasmine Hawamdeh is the director of arts and culture
[03:52.32]at the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee.
[03:57.44]She said people often think of "the angry Arab,
[04:01.44]the terrorist Arab," or are "afraid
[04:04.88]of the Arab that comes from abroad."
[04:08.36]Another harmful idea, she said,
[04:10.96]is "the oppressed Arab woman."
[04:14.60]The museum tries to correct these false narratives
[04:18.28]about Arab Americans.
[04:21.00]But Abouali said the museum also tries to present
[04:26.24]Arab Americans as "ourselves."
[04:30.76]Although Arab Americans come from 22 countries,
[04:34.80]from northern Africa to western Asia,
[04:38.04]she said once they settle in the U.S.,
[04:41.68]they become as American as they are Arab.
