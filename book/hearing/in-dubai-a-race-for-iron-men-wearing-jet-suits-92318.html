。
[00:00.04]The pilots started their jet engines
[00:02.96]on a runway in the United Arab Emirates city
[00:06.76]of Dubai on Wednesday.
[00:09.88]But they were not preparing to fly an aircraft.
[00:14.80]They themselves would fly
[00:17.28]— in the first-ever "jet suit race."
[00:21.76]The seven pilots with jet engines on their backs
[00:26.00]raced along the tall buildings of Dubai
[00:30.04]like a scene from the movie Iron Man.
[00:34.68]"The closest analogy would be that dream of flying
[00:39.92]... and then going wherever your mind is taking you,"
[00:44.60]said Richard Browning.
[00:47.52]He is the founder and chief test pilot
[00:51.52]for Gravity Industries,
[00:54.04]the company that held the race with Dubai.
[00:58.56]Browning added that the movie
[01:01.12]created the scene using computer technology,
[01:05.36]but his company did it "for real."
[01:10.12]The pilots wore 1,500-horsepower jet suits for the race.
[01:18.24]Those engines have more mechanical power
[01:21.88]than most sports cars and use the same fuel
[01:26.76]as the Airbus A380 and Boeing 777 passenger jets.
[01:35.28]Then came what pilot Issa Kalfon
[01:38.72]called "the moment of truth."
[01:42.28]The engines roared and pilots jumped
[01:46.08]and leaned forward.
[01:48.88]And they took off like a helicopter.
[01:52.80]Organizers said they took off from the runway
[01:57.84]next to the water to enable higher speeds.
[02:02.92]The jet suit currently can reach speeds
[02:06.52]of 128 kilometers an hour, Gravity Industries said.
[02:13.76]It is also safer for the pilots
[02:16.84]to fly short distances above water.
[02:21.64]Kalfon, who won the race,
[02:24.52]said he was nervous before his flight.
[02:28.44]"Everything's hot, it's running,
[02:31.44]the engines are screaming at you," Kalfon said.
[02:35.60]But he said the jet suit was safe and easy to handle.
[02:42.92]There was one crash during Wednesday's race.
[02:47.40]Emirati pilot Ahmed al-Shehhi
[02:50.68]smashed into the water, going feet first
[02:55.52]but immediately came to the surface
[02:58.48]to give a thumbs-up to rescuers.
[03:02.96]An announcer described him as having
[03:06.00]just 12 days of training before the race.
[03:11.12]"It's pretty amazing to see
[03:13.40]that they can do this in Dubai,
[03:15.84]and they have these guys flying over the water,"
[03:19.92]said Jennifer Ross, an American who lives in Dubai.
[03:26.00]"It's kind of like astronauts flying around in space."
[03:31.72]With its beaches, bars and buildings,
[03:35.12]Dubai has long been a city
[03:37.68]known for its love of aviation.
[03:41.96]The city is home to the world's
[03:44.44]busiest airport for international travel.
[03:49.60]It also has been developing the idea
[03:53.08]of flying taxis for several years.
[03:57.76]There are risks to jet suit travel, however.
[04:03.00]In 2020, Vincent Reffet
[04:06.64]died in a crash during training
[04:09.72]for a different flying project.
[04:13.20]He was famous for once flying alongside
[04:17.16]a two-level Emirates A380 jet.
