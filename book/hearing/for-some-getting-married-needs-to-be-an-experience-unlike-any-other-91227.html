<p>More <strong>couples</strong> are asking guests to wear nontraditional clothing to their marriage ceremonies.</p>
<p>The result appears to be that many guests are not sure what to think about it and are confused by the unusual requests.</p>
<p>Maggie Long is 34 years old and lives in New York. Not too long ago, she attended the wedding of a close friend at a restaurant in Denver, Colorado. The couple described the suggested clothing for the event as, "dive bar semiformal." A dive bar is a low cost drinking place where people are not known for good behavior.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Wedding guests who adhered to the dress code of Space Disco Cowboy, pose at a wedding in Austin, Texas on March 30, 2019.

<p>"I love a <strong>theme</strong>," said Long. "It's fun that people aren't taking weddings so seriously, but I had no idea what that meant."</p>
<p>At the dive bar wedding, Long said many older guests got into the idea. One guest wore a rainbow tie-dye shirt, a colorful informal shirt made popular in the 1960s.</p>
<p>Other wedding guests have been invited to weddings that were described as, "tropical formal," "<strong>snappy</strong> casual" and "garden party <strong>whimsical</strong>."</p>
<p>Emily Coyne is the founder of Emily Coyne Events, a wedding design company based in San Francisco, California. She said many couples are trying to make their weddings different from everyone else's wedding.</p>
<p>"The key is making sure there's communication behind the <strong>dress code</strong>. Don't just confuse guests," she said.</p>
<p>When her company designs wedding websites for couples, it includes descriptions for the dress code. The dress code is a description of the kinds of clothes considered right for the event. "Tropical formal," for example, might include long dresses in bright colors and <strong>suits</strong> with unusual ties.</p>
<p>"Most guests have a lot of fun with it," Coyne said.</p>
<p>Rikki Gotthelf attended her friend's "space <strong>disco</strong> cowboy" wedding. The hosts sent their guests to an <strong>abandoned</strong> town near Austin, Texas.</p>
<p>For guidance, Gotthelf looked to Sophie Strauss, who calls herself a "<strong>stylist</strong> for regular people." Strauss suggests asking the couple directly if they had not made themselves clear.</p>
<p>She tells guests dealing with strange dress codes to remember: "It's not a <strong>costume</strong>. Unless, of course, it's <strong>literally</strong> a costume party."</p>
<p>Often, there is some form of personal meaning behind the unusual wedding themes. Thirty-two-year-old Madison Smith is getting married in May 2024. Her dress code calls for "black tie sunset glam."</p>
<p>"It's in honor of my late grandfather," she said. "His favorite thing was the sunsets where I'm getting married." The wedding will be taking place on Long Beach Island, New Jersey.</p>
<p>She hopes for sunset-colored dresses that are orange, yellow, purple, blue or pink. She also wants suits with elements that are of similar, sunset colors.</p>
<p>Jove Meyer is the owner of an event planning company in Brooklyn. He has dealt with dress codes that included "colorful cocktail," and "red carpet ready."</p>
<p>"I always suggest couples <strong>clarify</strong> exactly what they mean," he said.</p>
<p>Brittny Drye is the lead editor of the wedding magazine Love Inc. She said guests should not be unwilling to ask the couple about an unusual dress code.</p>
<p>When couples are asking their guests to wear nontraditional clothes, "they're signing themselves up to be asked questions," Drye said.</p>
