<textarea id="lrc_content" name="textfield" style="display:none;">[ti:Marriages in South Korea Rise Slightly after Years of Decrease]

。
[00:00.04]The number of marriages in South Korea
[00:04.00]rose in 2023 for the first time
[00:08.76]in more than ten years.
[00:12.20]The increase came after the pandemic
[00:15.28]which forced some couples
[00:17.84]to delay marriage plans.
[00:21.00]But the data did not point
[00:22.88]to a continued increase
[00:25.24]in the aging country.
[00:28.32]The small rise in marriages last year
[00:31.96]comes as its fertility rate
[00:35.00]continued to decrease.
[00:38.12]South Korea's fertility rate,
[00:40.80]or the average number of children
[00:44.04]born per woman, is already the world's lowest.
[00:49.60]It is falling because women are concerned
[00:53.32]about their careers, the cost of raising children,
[00:57.88]or are deciding not to have babies.
[01:02.40]Government data showed a total of
[01:05.52]193,657 couples got married last year.
[01:14.32]That is up 1.0 percent
[01:17.60]from 191,690 a year earlier.
[01:24.68]It is the first increase since 2011.
[01:30.08]That compares with a 0.4 percent drop in 2022.
[01:37.44]That was when South Korea started
[01:40.32]to ease restrictions on social gatherings
[01:44.60]put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic.
[01:49.96]The restrictions saw the number of marriages
[01:53.32]decrease 9.8 percent in 2021
[01:58.40]and 10.7 percent in 2020.
[02:03.52]The 2023 number of marriages, however,
[02:07.64]remains well below the 239,159 marriages
[02:15.24]seen in 2019.
[02:18.72]And that compares to a yearly number
[02:22.00]of more than 320,000 recorded 10 years earlier.
[02:29.08]A government official said that couples
[02:31.96]delaying marriage was a reason for more marriages
[02:36.12]in the second half of 2022
[02:39.64]and the first half of 2023.
[02:44.00]"In the second half of 2023,
[02:47.12]however, marriages fell year-on-year,
[02:51.28]indicating that people
[02:53.24]who had been delaying marriage
[02:55.32]due to COVID-19 have now mostly got married,"
[03:00.20]the official told reporters.
[03:03.68]The 2023 increase was also well below
[03:07.88]the increases seen in nearby China.
[03:11.96]Marriages in China rose 12.4 percent last year.
[03:17.72]That happened as more couples got married
[03:20.76]after delays caused by the pandemic.
[03:25.12]Most South Koreans say high housing costs
[03:29.04]are the biggest reason for getting married.
[03:33.12]Many also see marriage as the first step
[03:36.92]before having a baby in the Asian country.
[03:41.60]The Yonhap news agency
[03:43.76]reported a recent study of 500 South Koreans
[03:48.92]aged between 19 and 23.
[03:53.04]It showed that 50.4 percent of those asked
[03:58.04]did not plan on getting married or having children.
[04:03.00]The government says it will take "extraordinary measure"
[04:07.32]to deal the low birth rate.
[04:10.92]Political parties are promising public housing
[04:14.92]and easier loans for young South Koreans
[04:18.84]ahead of the April legislative election.
[04:23.72]Marriages with a foreign national
[04:26.52]greatly increased for a second year,
[04:29.88]increasing 18.3 percent to 19,717.
