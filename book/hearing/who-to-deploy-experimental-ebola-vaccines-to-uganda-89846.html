[00:00.04]The World Health Organization (WHO) says
[00:05.04]it is preparing to deploy experimental Ebola vaccines to Uganda.
[00:13.04]The WHO's representative in Uganda, Yonas Tegegn Woldemariam,
[00:20.44]said Wednesday the deployment would happen in about "two weeks."
[00:25.88]The two vaccines being sent to the East African nation
[00:31.32]are still undergoing development.
[00:34.40]But they aim to target the Ebola version
[00:38.60]currently spreading in Uganda.
[00:41.56]One vaccine was developed by a U.S.-based nonprofit,
[00:46.92]the Sabin Vaccine Institute.
[00:50.36]The other was developed by Britain's Oxford University
[00:55.44]and the Serum Institute in India.
[00:59.72]"We are getting closer and closer to deploying vaccines,"
[01:04.56]Woldemariam told The Associated Press.
[01:08.32]"This is just another tool that we are going to try."
[01:13.60]Officials said health workers in Uganda
[01:17.72]were making final preparations to receive
[01:21.24]and give out the experimental vaccines.
[01:25.36]Ebola is a virus that can cause severe bleeding
[01:30.12]and organ failure.
[01:31.76]In serious cases, it can lead to death.
[01:35.64]A version of Ebola that came from Sudan
[01:40.16]is currently spreading in Uganda.
[01:43.32]So far, the virus has infected at least 60 people
[01:49.32]and killed 44 in Uganda, WHO officials said.
[01:56.80]Those numbers do not include people who likely died of Ebola
[02:02.44]before the latest outbreak was confirmed.
[02:06.44]Uganda declared the outbreak on September 20.
[02:11.36]It happened in a rural farming community
[02:15.12]about 150 kilometers west of the capital, Kampala.
[02:21.36]Officials in the area have issued stay-at-home orders
[02:26.44]and other restrictions in an effort to contain virus spread.
[02:33.16]Ebola is passed through contact with bodily fluids
[02:37.72]of a sick person or by infected materials.
[02:42.00]Symptoms can include high temperature,
[02:46.08]vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain and bleeding.
[02:51.16]The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
[02:56.00]states that scientists do not know
[02:59.48]where the Ebola virus came from.
[03:02.24]But based on similar viruses,
[03:05.52]they believe it likely starts in "bats or non-human primates."
[03:12.28]Ugandan officials are still investigating
[03:16.00]the start of the current outbreak.
[03:19.16]Uganda has already had several Ebola outbreaks,
[03:24.08]including one in 2000 that killed more than 200 people.
[03:29.88]An outbreak of Ebola that started in West Africa in 2014
[03:36.04]killed more than 11,000 people.
[03:39.80]Ebola was discovered in 1976
[03:44.08]during two different outbreaks
[03:46.76]that happened at the same time in Sudan
[03:50.36]and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
[03:53.80]The virus was first identified in a village in the Congo
[03:59.36]near the Ebola River and that is where it got its name.
