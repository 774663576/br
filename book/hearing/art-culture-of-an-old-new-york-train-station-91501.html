。
[00:00.04]The first subway station in New York City
[00:05.00]was designed to be a masterpiece
[00:08.44]and was considered a "jewel in the crown" when it opened.
[00:15.28]The trains in New York City's public transportation system,
[00:20.16]its subway, mostly run underground.
[00:25.48]Today, the main concern of subway designers
[00:29.96]is that their systems work correctly.
[00:34.68]New York's subway opened in 1904.
[00:40.04]City Hall Station was one of New York City's
[00:44.56]first underground subway stations.
[00:49.12]Now called Old City Hall Station,
[00:52.76]it was built during a time
[00:55.60]when many public buildings and spaces
[00:59.40]were designed to appear majestic.
[01:03.32]The goal was to demonstrate
[01:05.72]that New York could compete culturally
[01:09.16]with great European cities, sometimes called metropolises.
[01:15.96]"It was a statement that New York City had arrived
[01:19.56]at the level of the great European metropolises
[01:23.56]like London and Paris, Rome, Madrid...
[01:28.20]that New York City was taking its place
[01:31.76]as a world city," said Clifton Hood.
[01:36.88]Hood is a history professor at Hobart
[01:40.44]and William Smith Colleges in Geneva, New York.
[01:45.48]Inside Old City Hall Station,
[01:48.48]the top is not flat in shape but curved instead.
[01:54.88]The walls rise up to create a high, round shape known as a vault.
[02:02.12]Square pieces of glass, called tiles, shine.
[02:08.56]Some of the lights in the station are called chandeliers.
[02:13.32]These are beautiful hanging lights
[02:17.12]that hold many individual light bulbs
[02:20.64]and look like huge pieces of jewelry.
[02:25.64]Polly Desjarlais is with the New York Transit Museum.
[02:30.40]She said she was "blown away"
[02:34.44]when she first saw the old station.
[02:38.60]She used words like "lovely, elegant
[02:42.88]and really unique space" to describe the station.
[02:48.96]"I've heard [the station]be described as a celebration of curves,
[02:54.44]because there are a lot of curves.
[02:57.00]Everything is sort-of rounded," Desjarlais said.
[03:02.44]But those beautiful curves are why the station
[03:06.52]is no longer part of the normal subway system.
[03:11.24]Its rounded platform cannot fit long trains.
[03:16.60]"The platform at City Hall is really curved.
[03:21.00]It's a very, very tight curve,
[03:24.00]and the platform itself is just over 200 feet long.
[03:29.76]So, it's short," Desjarlais said.
[03:33.40]"As the subway got busier...
[03:36.08]trains got longer, and we added cars...
[03:39.72]We were growing those platforms and making them longer..."
[03:45.40]Although it is no longer part of the subway system,
[03:49.32]Old City Hall Station is still being used.
[03:53.44]One train line, the No. 6,
[03:56.88]uses the Old City Hall Station to turn around.
[04:01.52]And while the public cannot enter the station from the street,
[04:06.72]the members of the New York Transit Museum
[04:10.68]can see the station a few times a year
[04:14.40]at a cost of about $50.
[04:17.48]Over the years, there have been ideas
[04:21.00]to make the old station a restaurant
[04:24.12]or a place for travelers to the city to visit.
[04:29.00]However, security concerns put those ideas to rest.
[04:34.48]Today, the unofficial way for the public to see the old station
[04:40.08]is by taking the No. 6 train
[04:43.12]and staying on after the last stop.
[04:48.24]Then, the train turns around at the Old City Hall Station,
[04:53.28]and riders will be able to see the majestic space.
