<div class="line_en">He liked to see her deft movements, and she watched him too now and then with that maternal spirit of hers which was so amusing and yet so charming. He was clumsy at first, and she laughed at him. When she bent over and showed him how best to deal with a whole line their hands met. He was surprised to see her blush. He could not persuade himself that she was a woman; because he had known her as a flapper, he could not help looking upon her as a child still; yet the number of her admirers showed that she was a child no longer; and though they had only been down a few days one of Sally's cousins was already so attentive that she had to endure a lot of chaffing. His name was Peter Gann, and he was the son of Mrs. Athelny's sister, who had married a farmer near Ferne. Everyone knew why he found it necessary to walk through the hop-field every day.</div>

<div class="line_en">A call-off by the sounding of a horn was made for breakfast at eight, and though Mrs. Athelny told them they had not deserved it, they ate it very heartily. They set to work again and worked till twelve, when the horn sounded once more for dinner. At intervals the measurer went his round from bin to bin, accompanied by the booker, who entered first in his own book and then in the hopper's the number of bushels picked. As each bin was filled it was measured out in bushel baskets into a huge bag called a poke; and this the measurer and the pole-puller carried off between them and put on the waggon. Athelny came back now and then with stories of how much Mrs. Heath or Mrs. Jones had picked, and he conjured his family to beat her: he was always wanting to make records, and sometimes in his enthusiasm picked steadily for an hour. His chief amusement in it, however, was that it showed the beauty of his graceful hands, of which he was excessively proud. He spent much time manicuring them. He told Philip, as he stretched out his tapering fingers, that the Spanish grandees had always slept in oiled gloves to preserve their whiteness. The hand that wrung the throat of Europe, he remarked dramatically, was as shapely and exquisite as a woman's; and he looked at his own, as he delicately picked the hops, and sighed with self-satisfaction. When he grew tired of this he rolled himself a cigarette and discoursed to Philip of art and literature. In the afternoon it grew very hot. Work did not proceed so actively and conversation halted. The incessant chatter of the morning dwindled now to desultory remarks. Tiny beads of sweat stood on Sally's upper lip, and as she worked her lips were slightly parted. She was like a rosebud bursting into flower.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="八点钟，号角声起，该是吃早饭的时候了。阿西尔尼夫人笑骂他们都还没下力，不配去吃饭，可他们才不听这一套，早就开始狼吞虎咽了。吃过饭后，大家又开始劳作，一直忙到十二点午饭的号角吹响。测量员不时来田里转转，带着一个记账的小工挨个箱子地称重。他把每队采摘的蒲式耳数分别记在自己和采摘员的账本上。每个箱子装满后就用蒲式耳采摘篮一篮一篮地盛出来，装到一个大口袋里。随后，计量员和一个扛着扁担的人就把口袋抬走，堆到运货车上去了。阿西尔尼一会儿回来一趟，跟他们说希斯夫人或者琼斯夫人又采了多少，还鼓动家人快点超过她们。他老是想创下最高纪录，有时候心里热情高涨还能稳稳地坐下来工作一个钟头。对于他来说，这份工作最大的乐趣就是能好好展示他那双引以为傲的漂亮的手。他可是花了不少工夫修剪指甲呢。他伸出自己的纤纤十指，给菲利普说西班牙大公为了保持双手白皙嫩滑，睡觉的时候都要先搽橄榄油再戴上手套。“那双扼住欧洲咽喉的手，”他手舞足蹈地大侃道，“和女人的手一模一样，又细又滑。”他轻轻拈起啤酒花，眼睛盯着自己的手，得意地长出一口气。每次觉得厌烦了，就卷上一根烟卷，和菲利普聊几句文学、艺术。午后天气炎热，大家干起活来的劲头明显不足，谈话声也渐渐弱了下去。上午时分热情高涨的叽叽喳喳已经变成现在没精打采的片语只言。萨莉的上唇沁出密密的汗珠，她手底下忙着，嘴唇不自觉地微微张开，整个人就像一朵含苞待放的玫瑰骨朵儿。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Calling-off time depended on the state of the oast-house. Sometimes it was filled early, and as many hops had been picked by three or four as could be dried during the night. Then work was stopped. But generally the last measuring of the day began at five. As each company had its bin measured it gathered up its things and, chatting again now that work was over, sauntered out of the garden. The women went back to the huts to clean up and prepare the supper, while a good many of the men strolled down the road to the public-house. A glass of beer was very pleasant after the day's work.</div>

<div class="line_en">He was an outlandish figure, with his wide-brimmed hat and pointed beard, among those country folk, and it was easy to see that they thought him very queer; but his spirits were so high, his enthusiasm so contagious, that it was impossible not to like him. Conversation went easily. A certain number of pleasantries were exchanged in the broad, slow accent of the Isle of Thanet, and there was uproarious laughter at the sallies of the local wag. A pleasant gathering! It would have been a hard-hearted person who did not feel a glow of satisfaction in his fellows. Philip's eyes wandered out of the window where it was bright and sunny still; there were little white curtains in it tied up with red ribbon like those of a cottage window, and on the sill were pots of geraniums. In due course one by one the idlers got up and sauntered back to the meadow where supper was cooking.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿西尔尼是号怪人，尖尖的脑袋上戴着宽檐帽子，在一群乡下人中间格格不入。不难看出，他们都觉得他非常奇怪。但是他兴致极高，热情洋溢，带着身边的人也高兴起来，叫人很难不喜欢。谈话自然而然地进行着。大家操一口浓浓的萨尼特岛口音，逗笑打趣，妙语连珠。不时爆发出的大笑几乎要把房顶都掀翻了。多有意思的聚会啊！恐怕身处这群可爱的伙伴之间，只有石头心肠的人才会眉头紧皱吧。菲利普的眼睛看向窗外，天空亮堂堂的，太阳也还没有落山。酒馆的窗户和农舍一样，都挂着用红丝带扎好的白色小帘，窗台上摆着几盆天竺葵。慢慢地，闲坐在这儿的人一个个都起身往小屋走了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She gave him the money, copper by copper. The bar-parlour was already well filled. It had a sanded floor, benches round it, and yellow pictures of Victorian prize-fighters on the walls. The licencee knew all his customers by name, and he leaned over his bar smiling benignly at two young men who were throwing rings on a stick that stood up from the floor: their failure was greeted with a good deal of hearty chaff from the rest of the company. Room was made for the new arrivals. Philip found himself sitting between an old labourer in corduroys, with string tied under his knees, and a shiny-faced lad of seventeen with a love-lock neatly plastered on his red forehead. Athelny insisted on trying his hand at the throwing of rings. He backed himself for half a pint and won it. As he drank the loser's health he said:</div>

<div class="line_en">He was tired and happy. After supper, balancing himself against the wall of the hut on a chair without a back, he smoked his pipe and looked at the night. Sally was busy. She passed in and out of the hut, and he lazily watched her methodical actions. Her walk attracted his notice; it was not particularly graceful, but it was easy and assured; she swung her legs from the hips, and her feet seemed to tread the earth with decision. Athelny had gone off to gossip with one of the neighbours, and presently Philip heard his wife address the world in general.</div>

<div class="line_en">They turned a corner, and a breath of warm wind beat for a moment against their faces. The earth gave forth its freshness. There was something strange in the tremulous night, and something, you knew not what, seemed to be waiting; the silence was on a sudden pregnant with meaning. Philip had a queer feeling in his heart, it seemed very full, it seemed to melt (the hackneyed phrases expressed precisely the curious sensation), he felt happy and anxious and expectant. To his memory came back those lines in which Jessica and Lorenzo murmur melodious words to one another, capping each other's utterance; but passion shines bright and clear through the conceits that amuse them. He did not know what there was in the air that made his senses so strangely alert; it seemed to him that he was pure soul to enjoy the scents and the sounds and the savours of the earth. He had never felt such an exquisite capacity for beauty. He was afraid that Sally by speaking would break the spell, but she said never a word, and he wanted to hear the sound of her voice. Its low richness was the voice of the country night itself.</div>
