He felt like Moses as the sea of red sashes and caps parted before him, allowing him to pass.

<div class="line_en">"His research proved yet again that man's mind is progressing faster than his soul!" The camerlegno's voice was sharper than he had expected. He lowered his voice. "If a man as spiritual as your father could create a weapon like the one we saw tonight, imagine what an ordinary man will do with his technology."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="「他的研究再一次证明人类的理性发展得比心灵要快！」总司库的声音不自觉尖锐起来。他压低声音。「如果一个像你父亲那么重视性灵的人，都可以製造出像我们今晚所看到的武器，那想想一个普通人会利用这种技术去做什么。」">查看中文翻译</div>

Mankind was not spiritually evolved enough for the powers he possessed. We have never created a weapon we have not used!

Leonardo Vetra's genius was dangerous for another reason.</div>

<div class="line_en">"You mean the day they stop needing thechurch," Vittoria challenged, moving toward him. "Doubt is your last shred of control. It isdoubt that brings souls to you. Our need to know that life has meaning. Man's insecurity and need for an enlightened soul assuring him everything is part of a master plan. But the church is not the only enlightened soul on the planet! We all seek God in different ways. What are you afraid of? That God will show himself somewhereother than inside these walls? That people will find him in their own lives and leave your antiquated rituals behind? Religions evolve! The mind finds answers, the heart grapples with new truths. My father was onyour quest! A parallel path! Why couldn't you see that? God is not some omnipotent authority looking down from above, threatening to throw us into a pit of fire if we disobey. God is the energy that flows through the synapses of our nervous system and the chambers of our hearts! God is in all things!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="「你指的是他们不再需要教会的那一天吧。」薇多利雅指责道，她走向总司库。「你最后的控制工具，就是怀疑。怀疑带领人们的灵魂走向你。我们必须确定生命是有意义的。人类的不安全感以及灵魂启蒙的需要，让他们确信一切都是在伟大计画之下。但教会不是地球上唯一受启蒙的灵魂！我们都以不同的方式在寻找上帝。你怕的是什么？怕上帝显示自己，却不在梵蒂冈的围墙内？怕人们会在自己的生活裡找到上帝，而抛弃你们陈旧的仪式？宗教一直在演进！理性会找出解答，心灵会努力了解新的真相。我父亲追求的东西跟你们一样！朝向同一个方向！你为什么不明白这点？上帝不是什么无所不能的权威，高高在上往下看著，威胁如果我们不听话，就要把我们丢进火坑裡。上帝是一股能量，流经我们神经系统的每个突触，以及心脏的每个心室。上帝就在世间万物中！」">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"For centuries," the camerlegno said, "the church has stood by while science picked away at religion bit by bit. Debunking miracles. Training the mind to overcome the heart. Condemning religion as the opiate of the masses. They denounce God as a hallucination -- a delusional crutch for those too weak to accept that life is meaningless. I could not stand by while science presumed to harness the power of God himself! Proof, you say? Yes, proof of science's ignorance! What is wrong with the admission that something exists beyond our understanding? The day science substantiates God in a lab is the day people stop needing faith!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="「几世纪以来，」总司库说：「当科学一点接一点挑剔宗教时，教会总是袖手旁观。揭穿奇蹟的真相，训练人们的理智战胜心灵，谴责宗教是人民的鸦片。科学指控上帝是一种幻觉──是一种虚幻的支柱，提供给那些脆弱得不肯承认生命毫无意义的人。当科学擅自使用上帝的权力时，我不能袖手旁观！你们想要证据吗？没错，科学愚昧的证据！承认有些事物是我们无法理解的，这有什么不对？科学在实验室裡证实上帝存在的那一天，就是人们不再需要宗教的那一天！」">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Exceptscience," the camerlegno fired back, his eyes showing only pity. "Science, by definition, is soulless. Divorced from the heart. Intellectual miracles like antimatter arrive in this world with no ethical instructions attached. This in itself is perilous! But when science heralds its Godless pursuits as the enlightened path? Promising answers to questions whose beauty is that they have no answers?" He shook his head. "No."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="「科学除外。」总司库反击，眼中只有怜悯。「在定义上，科学就是没有灵魂，跟心灵是完全两回事。像反物质这类知性的奇蹟来到这个世界，没有附加任何道德指南。这本身就太危险了！可是当科学把追求无神当作启蒙的道路呢？甚至保证要回答那些根本没有答案的问题呢？」他摇摇头。「不行。」">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The camerlegno turned to him, surprised by the pain in his voice. CertainlyMortati could understand. Headlines carried science's miracles every day. How long had it been for religion? Centuries? Religion needed a miracle! Something to awaken a sleeping world. Bring them back to the path of righteousness. Restore faith. Thepreferiti were not leaders anyway, they were transformers -- liberals prepared to embrace the new world and abandon the old ways! This was the only way. A new leader. Young. Powerful. Vibrant. Miraculous. Thepreferiti served the church far more effectively in death than they ever could alive. Horror and Hope. Offer four souls to save millions. The world would remember them forever as martyrs. The church would raise glorious tribute to their names. How many thousands have died for the glory of God? They are only four.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="总司库转向他，很惊讶他声音中的痛苦。莫塔提一定明白他的用意。报纸标题天天都有科学的奇蹟。但宗教奇蹟多久没出现了？几世纪了？宗教需要一个奇蹟！唤醒沉睡的世界。把他们带回正确的道路，恢复他们的信仰。四位候选人无论如何不是领袖，他们是改革者──拥抱新世界、弃绝古老方式的自由派！这是唯一的方法。教会需要新领袖，年轻、强势、充满生气、能创造奇蹟。那四位候选人死掉，对教会的实际帮助会比活著更多。恐怖与希望。牺牲四条人命，却能拯救几百万人。世人会永远记得这四位殉道者。教会将称颂他们的名字。有几千、几万人曾为神的荣耀而死？这回才四个人而已。">查看中文翻译</div>

Burn a church and the community rises up, holding hands, singing hymns of defiance as they rebuild. Look how they flock tonight. Fear has brought them home. Forge modern demons for modern man. Apathy is dead. Show them the face of evil -- Satanists lurking among us -- running our governments, our banks, our schools, threatening to obliterate the very House of God with their misguided science. Depravity runs deep. Man must be vigilant. Seek the goodness. Become the goodness!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="「听听那个歌声。」总司库说，微笑著，自己也满心喜悦。「没有什么要比邪恶出现更能团结人心的了。烧掉一座教堂，整个社区就会站起来手牵手，在重建教堂时唱著挑战的讚美诗。看看今夜他们都聚集在这裡，恐惧把他们带到心灵的家园来。我们要为现代人打造现代的恶魔。冷漠无情已经消失了。让他们看看邪恶的脸孔──潜伏在我们之间的魔鬼崇拜者──统治著我们的政府、我们的银行、我们的学校，威胁要以他们受到误导的科学，毁掉这座上帝的寓所。邪恶力量潜伏得很深，人类必须小心警惕。寻找良善，成为善人！」">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The camerlegno saw the horror in Mortati's eyes and again felt confused. Was it the morphine? Mortati was looking at him as if the camerlegno himself had killed these men with his bare hands. I would do even that for God, the camerlegno thought, and yet he had not. The deeds had been carried out by the Hassassin -- a heathen soul tricked into thinking he was doing the work of the Illuminati. I am Janus, the camerlegno had told him. I will prove my power. And he had. The Hassassin's hatred had made him God's pawn.</div>

<div class="line_en">The camerlegno did not answer. Mortati had no way of knowing, but the brands had been confiscated by the Vatican over a century ago. They had been locked away, forgotten and dust covered, in the Papal Vault -- the Pope's private reliquary, deep within his Borgia apartments. The Papal Vault contained those items the church deemed too dangerous for anyone's eyes except the Pope's.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="总司库没回答。莫塔提无从得知，但那些烙印模是超过一个世纪前被梵蒂冈没收的。一直被封锁、遗忘、罩满灰尘，就放在教宗保险库──教宗的私人圣物箱，位于波吉亚大楼的深处。教宗保险库裡放了一些被教会认为太危险、除教宗外不宜让其他人看到的东西。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="「可是……那些烙印呢？」莫塔提的声音充满愤慨。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The vault's key was passed down from Pope to Pope. Camerlegno Carlo Ventresca had purloined the key and ventured inside; the myth of what the vault contained was bewitching -- the original manuscript for the fourteen unpublished books of the Bible known as theApocrypha, the third prophecy of Fatima, the first two having come true and the third so terrifying the church would never reveal it. In addition to these, the camerlegno had found the Illuminati Collection -- all the secrets the church had uncovered after banishing the group from Rome… their contemptible Path of Illumination… the cunning deceit of the Vatican's head artist, Bernini… Europe's top scientists mocking religion as they secretly assembled in the Vatican's own Castle St. Angelo. The collection included a pentagon box containing iron brands, one of them the mythical Illuminati Diamond. This was a part of Vatican history the ancients thought best forgotten. The camerlegno, however, had disagreed.</div>

And so we hang the symbol of the crucifix before our eyes bloody, painful, agonizing -- to remind us of evil's power! To keep our hearts vigilant!
