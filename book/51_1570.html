<div class="line_en">My sister and my mother come first. I reach out to Prim and she climbs on my lap, her arms around my neck, head on my shoulder, just like she did when she was a toddler. My mother sits beside me and wraps her arms around us. For a few minutes, we say nothing. Then I start telling them all the things they must remember to do, now that I will not be there to do them for them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="妈妈和妹妹最先来到。我上前抱住波丽姆，她爬到我的膝盖上，搂着我的脖子，头倚在我肩上，就像她在蹒跚学步时一样。妈妈坐在我身边，搂着我们两个。有几分钟，我们没说话。过了一会，我开始嘱咐她们要牢记哪些事情，那些事情我已不再能够为她们做了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The moment the anthem ends, we are taken into custody. I don't mean we're handcuffed or anything, but a group of Peacekeepers marches us through the front door of the Justice Building. Maybe tributes have tried to escape in the past. I've never seen that happen though.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="国歌一结束，我们就被监管起来。我并不是说被拷起来或者别的什么，而是由治安警看管着，穿过法院大楼的前门。以前的“贡品”也许有逃跑的，尽管我从没见过这种事情发生。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Once inside, I'm conducted to a room and left alone. It's the richest place I've ever been in, with thick, deep carpets and a velvet couch and chairs. I know velvet because my mother has a dress with a collar made of the stuff. When I sit on the couch, I can't help running my fingers over the fabric repeatedly. It helps to calm me as I try to prepare for the next hour. The time allotted for the tributes to say good-bye to their loved ones. I cannot afford to get upset, to leave this room with puffy eyes and a red nose. Crying is not an option. There will be more cameras at the train station.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="进到门里，我被领我到一间屋子里，一个人留在那。这是我见过的最华丽的地方，厚厚的地毯，天鹅绒的沙发和椅子。我之所以认得天鹅绒，是因为妈妈有一件衣服的领子就是用那东西做得。我坐在沙发上，忍不住用手来回抚弄着柔软的天鹅绒，这可以帮我镇静下来，迎接下一时刻的到来。不久，我们就要和所爱的人说再见，而我是不能分心的，我不能红鼻子肿眼泡地从这件屋子走出去。哭不是好的选择。火车站会有更多的摄相机在等着我们。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Prim is not to take any tesserae. They can get by, if they're careful, on selling Prim's goat milk and cheese and the small apothecary business my mother now runs for the people in the Seam. Gale will get her the herbs she doesn't grow herself, but she must be very careful to describe them because he's not as familiar with them as I am. He'll also bring them game -- he and I made a pact about this a year or so ago -- and will probably not ask for compensation, but they should thank him with some kind of trade, like milk or medicine.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我告诉她们波丽姆决不能领食品券。她们节俭些，靠卖波丽姆的羊产的羊奶和奶酪，还有妈妈在“夹缝地带”开的小药店生意，还能凑活着过。盖尔会把妈妈没法种的草药采来给她，可一定要详详细细把草药的样子告诉他，因为他不像我那么熟悉。他还会带给她们猎物――我们俩大约一年前做了约定――应该不要她们的报偿，可她们也得对他表示感谢，给他些羊奶或者药什么的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When I am done with instructions about fuel, and trading, and staying in school, I turn to my mother and grip her arm, hard. "Listen to me. Are you listening to me?" She nods, alarmed by my intensity. She must know what's coming. "You can't leave again," I say.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我又对家里烧的柴火、怎么交换货物、上学等事嘱咐了她们一番，之后我转过身来，紧紧抓住妈妈的胳膊，说：“一定要听我的话，你在听吗？”她点点头，对我说话的强烈语气吃了一惊。对要发生的事，她一定也明白。“你不能再离开我们了。”我说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I don't bother suggesting Prim learn to hunt. I tried to teach her a couple of times and it was disastrous. The woods terrified her, and whenever I shot something, she'd get teary and talk about how we might be able to heal it if we got it home soon enough. But she makes out well with her goat, so I concentrate on that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我不用建议波丽姆去学打猎了，因为以前我也教过她一两次，可简直都是灾难。她一到林子里就害怕，我打猎物，她就眼泪汪汪地，说是如果打到猎物，马上拿回家还能把它的伤口治好之类的话。她养的羊还真不错，所以我也就随她了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="这时治安警来到门口，示意时间到了，我们紧紧拥抱在一起，甚至弄疼了彼此，我嘴里不住地说着：“我爱你，爱你们俩。”她们刚要说话，保安就命令她们出去，然后关上了门。我把头埋在天鹅绒枕头里，好像它能把一切烦恼挡在外面。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Someone else enters the room, and when I look up, I'm surprised to see it's the baker, Peeta Mellark's father. I can't believe he's come to visit me. After all, I'll be trying to kill his son soon. But we do know each other a bit, and he knows Prim even better. When she sells her goat cheeses at the Hob, she puts two of them aside for him and he gives her a generous amount of bread in return. We always wait to trade with him when his witch of a wife isn't around because he's so much nicer. I feel certain he would never have hit his son the way she did over the burned bread. But why has he come to see me?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="又有人进来了，我抬头看时，很吃了一惊，是面包房老板，皮塔·麦拉克的爸爸。我不敢相信他会来看我。不管怎么说，我不久就要竭尽全力杀死他的儿子。可我们并不怎么认识，他甚至对波丽姆还更熟悉些，因为波丽姆在矿上卖奶酪时，每次都给他留出两块儿，他也会很慷慨地给她些面包。我们总是等他刁蛮的老婆不在跟前的时候才跟他交易，因为他比他老婆好多了。我很肯定他一定不会像他老婆，因为烤糊的面包而去殴打自己的儿子。可他为什么要来看我？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Thank you," I say. The baker's not a very talkative man in the best of times, and today he has no words at all. "I had some of your bread this morning. My friend Gale gave you a squirrel for it." He nods, as if remembering the squirrel. "Not your best trade," I say. He shrugs as if it couldn't possibly matter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“谢谢你。”我说。面包房老板平时就不大爱说话，此时更是无语。“我今天早晨就吃了你们的面包，是我朋友盖尔用松鼠换的。”他点点头，好像想起了松鼠的事。“你吃亏了。”我说。他耸耸肩，好像并不太在意。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I feel some of the pressure in my chest lighten at his words. People deal with me, but they are genuinely fond of Prim. Maybe there will be enough fondness to keep her alive.</div>

"They let you wear one thing from your district in the arena. One thing to remind you of home. Will you wear this?" She holds out the circular gold pin that was on her dress earlier. I hadn't paid much attention to it before, but now I see it's a small bird in flight.</div>

<div class="line_en">Finally, Gale is here and maybe there is nothing romantic between us, but when he opens his arms I don't hesitate to go into them.

<div class="line_en">"I don't even know if there'll be wood," I say. Another year, they tossed everybody into a landscape of nothing but boulders and sand and scruffy bushes. I particularly hated that year. Many contestants were bitten by venomous snakes or went insane from thirst.</div>

<div class="line_en">Peeta Mellark, on the other hand, has obviously been crying and interestingly enough does not seem to be trying to cover it up. I immediately wonder if this will be his strategy in the Games. To appear weak and frightened, to reassure the other tributes that he is no competition at all, and then come out fighting. This worked very well for a girl, Johanna Mason, from District 7 a few years back. She seemed like such a sniveling, cowardly fool that no one bothered about her until there were only a handful of contestants left. It turned out she could kill viciously. Pretty clever, the way she played it. But this seems an odd strategy for Peeta Mellark because he's a baker's son. All those years of having enough to eat and hauling bread trays around have made him broad-shouldered and strong. It will take an awful lot of weeping to convince anyone to overlook him.</div>

<div class="line_en">In school, they tell us the Capitol was built in a place once called the Rockies. District 12 was in a region known as Appalachia. Even hundreds of years ago, they mined coal here. Which is why our miners have to dig so deep.</div>

<div class="line_en">Somehow it all comes back to coal at school. Besides basic reading and math most of our instruction is coal-related. Except for the weekly lecture on the history of Panem. It's mostly a lot of blather about what we owe the Capitol. I know there must be more than they're telling us, an actual account of what happened during the rebellion.

<div class="line_en">They're funny birds and something of a slap in the face to the Capitol. During the rebellion, the Capitol bred a series of genetically altered animals as weapons. The common term for them was muttations, or sometimes mutts for short. One was a special bird called a jabberjay that had the ability to memorize and repeat whole human conversations. They were homing birds, exclusively male, that were released into regions where the Capitol's enemies were known to be hiding. After the birds gathered words, they'd fly back to centers to be recorded. It took people awhile to realize what was going on in the districts, how private conversations were being transmitted. Then, of course, the rebels fed the Capitol endless lies, and the joke was on it. So the centers were shut down and the birds were abandoned to die off in the wild.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这些鸟很滑稽，也是对凯匹特一种嘲讽。以前各区反抗凯匹特时，凯匹特人饲养了各种转基因鸟类作为武器。通常这些鸟被称作“杂种鸟”，或者有时就叫“杂种”作为简称。其中一种鸟被叫作“叽喳鸟”，它能够记住并重复人们说过的所有的话，能自引导返回鸟巢，特别是雄鸟。它们被放到凯匹特敌人藏身的地方。鸟听到情报后，就飞回中心报信。各辖区的人用了很长时间才弄清楚他们私下的谈话以及区里的事情是怎么被传递出去的。于是，这些反叛者给凯匹特送去了许多假情报，凯匹特因此被愚弄。所有饲养中心关闭，那些鸟被遗弃，随它们在野外自生自灭。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Only they didn't die off. Instead, the jabberjays mated with female mockingbirds, creating a whole new species that could replicate both bird whistles and human melodies. They had lost the ability to enunciate words but could still mimic a range of human vocal sounds, from a child's high-pitched warble to a man's deep tones. And they could re-create songs. Not just a few notes, but whole songs with multiple verses, if you had the patience to sing them and if they liked your voice.</div>

<div class="line_en">My father was particularly fond of mockingjays. When we went hunting, he would whistle or sing complicated songs to them and, after a polite pause, they'd always sing back. Not everyone is treated with such respect. But whenever my father sang, all the birds in the area would fall silent and listen. His voice was that beautiful, high and clear and so filled with life it made you want to laugh and cry at the same time. I could never bring myself to continue the practice after he was gone. Still, there's something comforting about the little bird. It's like having a piece of my father with me, protecting me. I fasten the pin onto my shirt, and with the dark green fabric as a background, I can almost imagine the mockingjay flying through the trees.</div>

<div class="line_en">One by one, we see the other reapings, the names called, the volunteers stepping forward or, more often, not. We examine the faces of the kids who will be our competition. A few stand out in my mind. A monstrous boy who lunges forward to volunteer from District 2. A fox-faced girl with sleek red hair from District 5. A boy with a crippled foot from District 10. And most hauntingly, a twelve-year-old girl from District 11. She has dark brown skin and eyes, but other than that, she's very like Prim in size and demeanor. Only when she mounts the stage and they ask for volunteers, all you can hear is the wind whistling through the decrepit buildings around her. There's no one willing to take her place.</div>

You can't miss the desperation in my voice as I shove Prim behind me, as if I'm afraid no one will hear and they'll take Prim away. But, of course, they do hear. I see Gale pulling her off me and watch myself mount the stage. The commentators are not sure what to say about the crowd's refusal to applaud. The silent salute. One says that District 12 has always been a bit backward but that local customs can be charming. As if on cue, Haymitch falls off the stage, and they groan comically. Peeta's name is drawn, and he quietly takes his place. We shake hands. They cut to the anthem again, and the program ends.</div>
