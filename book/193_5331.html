<div class="line_en">Fear, Langdon now realized, was an intense motivator. Short of breath, he fumbled through the blackness toward the revolving door. He found the button on the wall and rammed his palm against it. Nothing happened. He tried again. The door was dead.</div>

<div class="line_en">When he threw his weight into the door, for an instant he thought he felt the door start to turn. He pushed again, seeing stars. Now he realized it was the entire room turning, not the door. Staggering away, Langdon tripped over the base of a rolling ladder and fell hard. He tore his knee against the edge of a book stack. Swearing, he got up and groped for the ladder.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他倒在地板上，一時間還以為門開始旋轉了。他又掙扎著起身，眼前冒金星，這才明白是整個房間在轉，不是門。蘭登踉蹌後退，跌倒在一把有腳輪的梯子底下，而且跌得很重，膝蓋被一個書架的邊緣刮破了。他冒著汗爬起身來，茫然摸索著找梯子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Spinning blind, he called out, but his voice emerged strangled. The peril of his predicament suddenly closed in around him. His lungs strained for oxygen as the adrenaline doubled his heart rate. He felt like someone had just punched him in the gut.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他盲目轉身，張嘴大喊，但發出的聲音卻被悶住了。他忽然感覺到危險的困境緊緊籠罩著他。他的肺急需氧氣，腎上腺素使他的心跳加倍。他覺得好像肚子剛被人打了一拳。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He found it. He had hoped it would be heavy wood or iron, but it was aluminum. He grabbed the ladder and held it like a battering ram. Then he ran through the dark at the glass wall. It was closer than he thought. The ladder hit head-on, bouncing off. From the feeble sound of the collision, Langdon knew he was going to need a hell of a lot more than an aluminum ladder to break this glass.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他找到了。但他本來希望梯子會是沉重的木頭或鐵製的，結果是鋁梯。他抓住梯子橫過來，當成破城錘似的，然後跑過黑暗衝向玻璃牆。牆比他以為的要近，梯子迎面撞上，彈回來。從碰撞時所發出的微弱聲響，蘭登明白他需要遠比鋁梯更有份量的東西，才能打破這面玻璃。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When he flashed on the semiautomatic, his hopes surged and then instantly fell. The weapon was gone. Olivetti had relieved him of it in the Pope's office, saying he did not want loaded weapons around with the camerlegno present. It made sense at the time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他想到那把半自動手槍，滿腹希望瞬間湧起，迅即又落下。槍不在他身上。歐里維提在教宗辦公室裡收回去了，說他不希望總司庫在場時，有人帶著武器走來走去。當時他覺得很有道理。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Langdon called out again, making less sound than the last time.</div>

<div class="line_en">Next he remembered the walkie-talkie the guard had left on the table outside the vault. Why the hell didn't I bring it in! As the purple stars began to dance before his eyes, Langdon forced himself to think. You've been trapped before, he told himself. You survived worse. You were just a kid and you figured it out. The crushing darkness came flooding in. Think!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接下來他想起那個衛兵留在外頭桌上的對講機。我幹嘛不帶進來呢！當眼前開始冒出紫色星星，蘭登硬逼自己趕快想辦法。你以前也被困住過，他告訴自己。你從更壞的情況撐過來。當時你只是個小孩，卻還是想出了辦法。無邊的漆黑緊緊籠罩著他。快想！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Langdon lowered himself onto the floor. He rolled over on his back and laid his hands at his sides. The first step was to gain control.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="這裡還有很多空氣，他告訴自己。還有很多。現在趕快想。他等待著，一半也期望著燈光隨時會再度亮起。結果沒有。他躺在那裡，現在呼吸比較順暢了，心中很奇怪地掠過了放棄的念頭。他感覺好平靜，然後奮力抵抗那個念頭。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">On Langdon's wrist, Mickey Mouse glowed happily as if enjoying the dark: 9:33P. M. Half an hour untilFire. Langdon thought it felt a whole hell of a lot later. His mind, instead of coming up with a plan for escape, was suddenly demanding an explanation. Who turned off the power? Was Rocher expanding his search? Wouldn't Olivetti have warned Rocher that I'm in here! Langdon knew at this point it made no difference.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="蘭登的手腕上，米老鼠開心地發著光，好像是在享受這片黑暗：九點三十三分。離火還有半小時。他腦子裡沒想到脫身計畫，卻忽然渴望一個解釋。誰關掉了電源？羅榭擴大搜索範圍了嗎？歐里維提沒警告羅榭我在這裡！想到這裡，蘭登明白其實沒差了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He wondered if any of the books in here were stored in heavy, steel, fireproof file cabinets. Langdon had seen them from time to time in other archives but had seen none here. Besides, finding one in the dark could prove time-consuming. Not that he could lift one anyway, particularly in his present state.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他很好奇，這裡會不會有哪本書收藏在厚厚的、鋼製的、防火的檔案櫃裡。蘭登在別的檔案室不時見到過這種櫃子，在這裡卻沒看到。何況在一片黑暗中尋找，實在太花時間了。就算找到他也搬不動，尤其是以他現在的虛弱狀況。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Opening his mouth wide and tipping back his head, Langdon pulled the deepest breaths he could manage. Each breath burned a little less than the last. His head cleared. He reeled his thoughts in and forced the gears into motion.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="蘭登頭後仰，張大嘴巴，使盡全力深呼吸。每個呼吸所造成的灼痛感都比上一個要減輕一點。現在腦袋清醒了，他收拾思緒，強迫自己開始好好思考。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">How about the examination table? Langdon knew this vault, like the other, had an examination table in the center of the stacks. So what! He knew he couldn't lift it. Not to mention, even if he could drag it, he wouldn't get it far. The stacks were closely packed, the aisles between them far too narrow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那閱覽桌呢？蘭登知道這個書庫就跟其他的一樣，房間中央會有個閱覽桌。那又怎樣！他知道他沒法搬起閱覽桌。更不必說，就算他拖得動桌子，也拖不了太遠。周圍的書架緊緊包圍著那張桌子，書架間的走道又太狹窄。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Suddenly, Langdon knew.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="忽然間，蘭登知道該怎麼做了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Positioning himself against the book stack like a football player against a training sled, he planted his feet and pushed. If I can somehow tip the shelf. But it barely moved. He realigned and pushed again. His feet slipped backward on the floor. The stack creaked but did not move.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他頭抵著書架，兩手張開扶著，擺出像美式足球員抵著訓練用滑撬的姿勢，然後站穩了腳用力推。如果我能設法推倒這個書架，但書架幾乎沒動。他重來一次，再推。他的雙腳在地板上往後滑。書架發出了吱嘎聲，但是沒移動。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">With a burst of confidence, he jumped to his feet far too fast. Swaying in the fog of a head rush, he reached out in the dark for support. His hand found a stack. Waiting a moment, he forced himself to conserve. He would need all of his strength to do this.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他生出一股信心，趕緊跳起身，速度太猛了。結果一時間暈眩得站不穩，在黑暗中伸手找個東西扶。他摸到了一個書架，等了一會兒，逼自己要省點力氣。接下來的行動得用上他所有的體力。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Finding the glass wall again, he placed one hand on it to guide him as he raced in the dark toward the far end of the vault. The back wall loomed suddenly, and he collided with it, crushing his shoulder. Cursing, Langdon circled the shelf and grabbed the stack at about eye level. Then, propping one leg on the glass behind him and another on the lower shelves, he started to climb. Books fell around him, fluttering into the darkness. He didn't care. Instinct for survival had long since overridden archival decorum. He sensed his equilibrium was hampered by the total darkness and closed his eyes, coaxing his brain to ignore visual input. He moved faster now. The air felt leaner the higher he went. He scrambled toward the upper shelves, stepping on books, trying to gain purchase, heaving himself upward. Then, like a rock climber conquering a rock face, Langdon grasped the top shelf. Stretching his legs out behind him, he walked his feet up the glass wall until he was almost horizontal.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他又回頭找到了玻璃牆，一手扶著好辨別方向，然後在黑暗中急步走向書庫深處。書庫的後牆忽然出現，他肩膀猛地撞上了。蘭登詛咒著，繞到最裡側那排書架後方，在大約眼睛的高度抓住書架。然後，他一腳撐在身後的玻璃牆上，另一腳跨在低處的書架格子上，開始往上爬。架上的書紛紛往下掉，散落在黑暗中。他沒理會。求生的本能早已蓋過了檔案管理員的禮儀。他感覺自己在一片黑暗中失去了平衡感，於是閉上眼睛，告訴自己的腦子不要理會眼睛所看到的。現在他移動得更快了。爬得愈高，感覺上空氣就愈稀薄。他往最高層書架攀爬，踩著一堆書，想把自己墊得高些，身體往上舉起。然後，就像攀岩者克服了一塊岩石，蘭登抓住了最頂層書架。他伸長兩條腿，抵在玻璃牆上，直到整個身子幾乎成水平。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他用力得頭都發暈了，把雙腳抵在身後的牆上，手臂和胸部緊抱著書架，然後猛力一推。一點動靜都沒有。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was an instant of weightless uncertainty. Then, with a thundering of books sliding off the shelves, Langdon and the shelf were falling forward.</div>

<div class="line_en">Now or never, Robert, a voice urged. Just like the leg press in the Harvard gym.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="羅柏，生死就看這一關了。一個聲音催促著。就像哈佛健身房裡的腿部推舉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Langdon rocked the shelf, extending his legs farther with each push. His quadriceps burned now, and he blocked the pain. The pendulum was in motion. Three more pushes, he urged himself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="蘭登搖晃著書架，隨著每次推動，雙腿愈來愈能伸展。膝蓋處的四頭肌好痛，他抵抗著那股痛。鐘擺作用正在進行中。再推三次，他催促自己。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Fighting for air, he repositioned and tried again, extending his legs. Ever so slightly, the stack moved. He pushed again, and the stack rocked forward an inch or so and then back. Langdon took advantage of the motion, inhaling what felt like an oxygenless breath and heaving again. The shelf rocked farther.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他掙扎著喘氣，重新擺好姿勢，又試了一次，努力伸展腿部。書架動了，雖然只是微微動一點。他又推，書架往前晃了一吋左右，然後又晃回來。蘭登利用這個動能，猛力吸了口好像不含氧的空氣，再度用力推。書架晃得更厲害了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Halfway to the ground, the shelf hit the stack next to it. Langdon hung on, throwing his weight forward, urging the second shelf to topple. There was a moment of motionless panic, and then, creaking under the weight, the second stack began to tip. Langdon was falling again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="倒到一半，書架撞上了隔壁那個。蘭登抓在上頭，把自己身體的重量往前壓，逼第二個書架翻倒。有那麼一刻靜止的緊張，然後，在重壓之下，第二個書架發出吱嘎聲，開始翻倒。蘭登又跟著往前落。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Like enormous dominoes, the stacks began to topple, one after another. Metal on metal, books tumbling everywhere. Langdon held on as his inclined stack bounced downward like a ratchet on a jack. He wondered how many stacks there were in all. How much would they weigh? The glass at the far end was thick…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="彷彿巨大的骨牌般，那些書架紛紛倒了下去，一個接一個。金屬書架壓著金屬書架，書翻落一地。蘭登像千斤頂上的防逆轉棘輪般，緊抓著他那個往下傾倒的書架。他納悶著這裡總共有多少書架，總重量會有多少？外頭那面玻璃很厚……">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Langdon's stack had fallen almost to the horizontal when he heard what he was waiting for -- a different kind of collision. Far off. At the end of the vault. The sharp smack of metal on glass. The vault around him shook, and Langdon knew the final stack, weighted down by the others, had hit the glass hard. The sound that followed was the most unwelcome sound Langdon had ever heard.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="蘭登的書架幾乎倒成水平時，他聽到了自己一直在等待的聲音──一種不一樣的碰撞聲，從書庫的另一頭遠遠傳來，那是金屬撞上玻璃的尖銳脆響。整個書庫震動起來，蘭登知道最後一個書架帶著其他書架的重量，狠狠撞上了那面玻璃。接下來的聲音是蘭登畢生最不想聽到的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was no crashing of glass, only the resounding thud as the wall accepted the weight of the stacks now propped against it. He lay wide-eyed on the pile of books. Somewhere in the distance there was a creaking. Langdon would have held his breath to listen, but he had none left to hold.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="沒有玻璃的爆裂聲，只有玻璃牆承受那些書架重量壓靠上去的響亮碰撞聲。他睜大眼睛躺在那堆書上。遠處傳來一個吱嘎聲，蘭登想憋住氣聽清楚，卻已經沒氣可憋了。">查看中文翻译</div>
