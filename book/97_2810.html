<div class="line_en">Back at the castle, the king and queen immediately ordered that the castle gates be locked. All the doors were closed and the windows shuttered. They kept the girls secluded and no longer opened the castle to visitors. The family stayed hidden, tucked away inside their walled kingdom.</div>

<div class="line_en">Worried, the king gave Elsa a pair of leather gloves. He advised her to keep them on at all times, and reminded her that she had to hide her icy magic in order to stay safe. "Conceal it," he told her.</div>

<div class="line_en">The training was difficult, and Elsa often felt unable to contain her magic. Ice seemed to form on her fingertips whenever she laughed or cried or became upset.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="训练的过程很困难，艾莎经常觉得无法控制自己的魔力。只要在她笑或哭或沮丧的时候，她的指尖似乎就会结冰。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The king and queen acted just as cautiously inside the castle. As the princesses grew, their parents did everything they could to ensure that Elsa learned to control herself. That meant the girls were hardly ever together. Nor did Elsa seek Anna out, since she was afraid she might accidentally hurt her. Day after day, Elsa spent most of her time training to be the next ruler -- and learning to keep her powers in check.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="国王和王后在城堡里行事小心谨慎。随着公主们渐渐长大，她们的父母尽一切所能确保艾莎能够自我克制。这就意味着姐妹俩基本不待在一起。艾莎也不会找安娜出去，因为她害怕会不小心伤害到妹妹。日子一天天过去了，艾莎大部分时间都在接受训练，学习如何治理国家——并学习控制魔力。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The years slipped by. Anna spent most of her time alone. Sometimes she played with her dolls; sometimes she pretended to have conversations with painted portraits in the gallery. But she was lonely.</div>

<div class="line_en">There was no reply from inside. The door did not open. Eventually, Anna went out into the courtyard and tried to build a snowman by herself. After rolling out a lopsided ball, she glanced up at Elsa's window and thought she saw someone smiling down at her. But when she looked again, the face was gone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="里面没有回应，房门也没有打开。最后，安娜独自走到院里，试着自己堆雪人。在滚了一个不对称的雪球之后，她抬眼瞥见了艾莎房间的窗户，好像看到有人在对她微笑。但是当她再看一眼的时候，却没了人影。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Without any memory of Elsa's magic, Anna had no idea why she was always alone. Over time, she simply came to accept that her sister's coldness was part of who she was. She didn't know that Elsa was lonely too, and that she missed Anna as much as Anna missed her. Elsa longed to play with Anna but was fearful of the harm her magic might cause by mistake.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因为完全不记得艾莎的魔法了，安娜丝毫不知道为什么她总是一个人。慢慢地，她开始认为姐姐就是这样一个冰冷的人。她不知道艾莎也很孤独，而且艾莎也非常想念她，就像她想念姐姐艾莎一样。艾莎多么渴望和安娜一起玩耍，却害怕她的魔法会误伤到妹妹。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">One day years later, when the girls were teenagers, the king and queen boarded a ship, intending to visit another kingdom. They hugged their daughters goodbye and left them at home, as they had many times before. But this time, the king and queen never returned. A storm engulfedthe ship, and they were lost at sea. The kingdom mourned their rulers.</div>
