<div class="line_en">Kitty was lying on her bed and the shutters were closed. It was after luncheon and the servants slept. What she had learnt that morning (and now she was certain that it was true) filled her with consternation. Ever since she came home she had been trying to think; but her mind was a blank, and she could not collect her thoughts. Suddenly she heard a step, the feet were booted so that it could not be one of the boys; with a gasp of apprehension she realized that it could only be her husband. He was in the sitting-room and she heard herself called. She did not reply. There was a moment's silence and then a knock on her door.</div>

<div class="line_en">He did now what he did seldom; he looked her full in the face; his professional instincts were stronger than his personal. She hesitated. Then she forced herself to meet his eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他直视着她的脸，这是一直以来他从未有过的。不过从他的神情来看，职业的诊察要多于丈夫的关切。她迟疑了一会儿，然后强迫自己盯住那双眼睛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She was accustomed to his habit of meeting with silence a statement which you would naturally expect to evoke an exclamation, but never had it seemed to her more devastating. He said nothing; he made no gesture; no movement on his face nor change of expression in his dark eyes indicated that he had heard. She felt suddenly inclined to cry. If a man loved his wife and his wife loved him, at such a moment they were drawn together by a poignant emotion. The silence was intolerable and she broke it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她已经习惯于在发表一通言论后，本应听到惊呼而得到的却往往是他的沉默，不过她不会因此受到多大影响。他一句话也没说，身体动也没动，脸上的肌肉像冻住一样，黑色的眼珠没有闪过任何新的神情表明他听到了什么。她忽然涌起想哭的欲望。如果一个男人爱他的妻子，他的妻子也爱他，得知这个消息时他们应该欢天喜地拥抱在一起。寂静让人难以忍受，她开口了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She gave a little gasp. There was just a shadow of a tremor in his voice; it was dreadful that cold self-control of his which made the smallest token of emotion so shattering. She did not know why she thought suddenly of an instrument she had been shown in Hong Kong upon which a needle oscillated a little and she had been told that this represented an earthquake a thousand miles away in which perhaps a thousand persons had lost their lives. She looked at him. He was ghastly pale. She had seen that pallor on him once, twice before. He was looking down, a little sideways.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她猛吸了一口气。他的声音里有某种吓人的东西，他太冷漠太镇定了，哪怕一丁点感情也绝不轻易外露，他这个人简直就像个怪物。她不知为什么想起了在香港看过的一件仪器，人们告诉她仪器上的针虽然只是微微震动，但是一千英里外就可能已经发生了一场地震，一千个人会在这场地震中死去。她看着他，他面无血色，这种脸色以前她曾见过一两次。他看向了地板，身子也朝一边侧了过去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She clasped her hands. She knew that if she could say yes it would mean everything in the world to him. He would believe her, of course he would believe her, because he Wanted to; and then he would forgive. She knew how deep was his tenderness and how ready he was, for all his shyness, to expend it. She knew that he was not vindictive; he would forgive her if she could but give him an excuse to, an excuse that touched his heart, and he would forgive completely. She could count on him never to throw the past in her teeth. Cruel he might be, cold and morbid, but he was neither mean nor petty. It would alter everything if she said yes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她攥紧了手。她知道如果她说了是，对他来说就意味着一个新的世界来临了。他会相信她，毫无疑问他会相信她，因为他想信。然后他就会尽弃前嫌原谅她。她知道他虽然害羞，但是他的心里藏着无尽的柔情，随时准备对人倾注出来。他绝不是记仇的人，他会原谅她。只要她给他一个借口，一个触动他心弦的借口，从前的是是非非他都会既往不咎。他绝不会兴师问罪，旧事重提，对此她可以一万个放心。或许他是残酷的，冷漠的，甚而是有些病态，但是他既不卑劣也不小气。如果她说了是，便会从此扭转乾坤。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嗯？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And she had an urgent need for sympathy. The unexpected knowledge that she was with child had overwhelmed her with strange hopes and unforeseen desires. She felt weak, frightened a little, alone and very far from any friends. That morning, though she cared little for her mother, she had had a sudden craving to be with her. She needed help and consolation. She did not love Walter, she knew that she never could, but at this moment she longed with all her heart for him to take her in his arms so that she could lay her head on his breast; clinging to him she could have cried happily; she wanted him to kiss her and she wanted to twine her arms around his neck.</div>

<div class="line_en">She began to weep. She had lied so much and she could lie so easily. What could a lie matter when it could only do good? A lie, a lie, what was a lie? It was so easy to say yes. She saw Walter's eyes melt and his arms outstretched towards her. She couldn't say it; she didn't know why, she just couldn't. All she had gone through during these bitter weeks, Charlie and his unkindness, the cholera and all these people dying, the nuns, oddly enough even that funny, drunken little Waddington, it all seemed to have changed her so that she did not know herself; though she was so deeply moved, some bystander in her soul seemed to watch her with terror and surprise. She had to tell the truth. It did not seem worth while to lie. Her thoughts wandered strangely: on a sudden she saw that dead beggar at the foot of the compound wall. Why should she think of him? She did not sob, the tears streamed down her face, quite easily, from wide eyes. At last she answered the question. He had asked her if he was the child's father.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她开始哭了。她撒了那么多的谎，现在不怕再撒一个。如果一句谎话将会带来好事，那又何乐而不为呢？谎言，谎言，谎言到底算什么？说“是”将会轻而易举。她几乎已经看到了瓦尔特狂喜的眼神和朝她张开的手臂。但是她不能。不知为什么，她就是不能。这几个苦难的礼拜以来她所经历过的一切——查理和他的卑劣，霍乱和正在死去的人们，嬷嬷，甚至那位滑稽的小酒鬼韦丁顿，似乎都在她的心里留下了什么，她变了，连自己也认不出自己。尽管她被美好的前景深深地打动了，但她感到在她的灵魂里，一群旁观者似乎正在惊恐地好奇地望着她。除了说真话，她别无选择。她觉得撒谎似乎并不值得。她的思绪胡乱地游动着，突然，她的眼前浮现出那个死乞丐躺在墙根下的情景。她为什么会想起他？她没有抽泣，眼泪像决了堤一样从她大大的眼睛里痛痛快快地淌下来。最后，她做出了回答。他曾问她他是不是孩子的父亲。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He gave the ghost of a chuckle. It made Kitty shudder. "It's a bit awkward, isn't it?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他吃吃地笑了，笑声像幽灵一样诡异。凯蒂不禁浑身颤抖。“有点难堪，对不对？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His answer was characteristic, it was exactly what she would have expected him to say, but it made her heart sink. She wondered it he realized how hard it had been for her to tell the truth (at the same moment she recognized that it had not been in the least hard, but inevitable) and if he gave her credit for it. Her answer, / don't know, I don't know, hammered away in her head. It was impossible now to take it back. She got her handkerchief from her bag and dried her eyes. They did not speak. There was a siphon on the table by her bed and he got her a glass of water. He brought it to her and held the glass while she drank. She noticed how thin his hand was, it was a fine hand, slender, with long fingers, but now it was nothing but skin and bone; it trembled a little; he could control his face, but his hand betrayed him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的回答符合他的个性，一点也没有出乎她的意料，但还是让她的心沉了下去。她希望他能够意识到她的思想经过多么激烈的斗争才最终说出了真相（同时她觉得这个选择其实并不艰难，而是自然而然不可避免的），希望他能对她给予信任。“我不知道，我不知道……”她的回答在她的脑子里嗡嗡地回响。现在已经不可能把它收回了。她从提包里找出手帕，擦干了眼泪。两个人都没有说话。床边的桌子上放着一根吸管，他为她端来了一杯水，将吸管插上。他走到她的跟前，手端着杯子，让她用吸管喝水。她注意到他的手，曾经精美、修长，指如青葱，现在只剩下皮包骨头了。他的手微微地颤抖着。他把表情控制得很好，但这只手背叛了他。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She drank the water and he put the glass back. He sat down on a chair and lit a cigarette. He gave a little sigh. Once or twice before she had heard him sigh like that and it always gave her a catch at the heart. Looking at him now, for he was staring with abstracted gaze out of the window, she was surprised that she had not noticed before how terribly thin he had grown during the last weeks. His temples were sunken and the bones of his face showed through the skin. His clothes hung on him loosely as though they had been made for a larger man. Through his sunburn his face had a greenish pallor. He looked exhausted. He was working too hard, sleeping little, and eating nothing. In her own grief and perturbation she found room to pity him. It was cruel to think that she could do nothing for him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她喝完了水，他把杯子放了回去。他坐到一把椅子上，掏出一根烟来点着，然后轻轻地叹了一声。他这样叹气曾经有过一两次，每次都会叫她胆战心惊。他的眼睛出神地望着窗外，她可以观察他一小会儿。她惊奇地发现他瘦得出奇，过去的几个礼拜以来她竟然没有注意到。他的太阳穴深深地陷了进去，脸上的骨头明显地凸了出来。身上的衣服空空荡荡的，好像穿的是别人的大号衣服。他的脸晒黑了，但是脸色苍白，甚至有些发绿。整个人看上去疲惫不堪。他工作太过辛苦了，几乎是废寝忘食。她正忙着哀伤悲痛，胡思乱想，但是也忍不住同情起他来。她什么也帮不上，这太残忍了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He put his hand over his forehead, as though his head were aching, and she had a feeling that in his brain too those words hammered madly: I don't know, I don't know. It was strange that this moody, cold, and shy man should have such a natural affection for very little babies; most men didn't care much even for their own, but the nuns, touched and a little amused, had more than once spoken of it. If he felt like that about those funny little Chinese babies what would he have felt about his own? Kitty bit her lips in order to prevent herself from crying again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他用手捂住前额，好像头疼的样子，她感觉他的脑子里也一直回荡着那个声音似的：我不知道，我不知道。这个情绪不定、冷漠害羞的男人，竟然见了小孩子就会变得柔情蜜意的，真令凯蒂无法理解。男人大多连亲生的孩子都不会放在心上，可是嬷嬷们不止一次地提过瓦尔特对孩子的喜爱，她们甚至被他感动，把这当成了趣谈。对那些逗人的中国婴儿尚且如此，如果是自己的孩子他又会怎么样呢？凯蒂咬住嘴唇，竭力不让自己再哭出来。">查看中文翻译</div>
