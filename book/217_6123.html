<div class="line_en">She said she wouldn't let me go by myself, but her husband would be in by and by, maybe in a hour and a half, and she'd send him along with me. Then she got to talking about her husband, and about her relations up the river, and her relations down the river, and about how much better off they used to was, and how they didn't know but they'd made a mistake coming to our town, instead of letting well alone – and so on and so on, till I was afeard I had made a mistake coming to her to find out what was going on in the town; but by and by she dropped on to pap and the murder, and then I was pretty willing to let her clatter right along. She told about me and Tom Sawyer finding the six thousand dollars (only she got it ten) and all about pap and what a hard lot he was, and what a hard lot I was, and at last she got down to where I was murdered.

And there's a reward out for old Finn, too – two hundred dollars. You see, he come to town the morning after the murder, and told about it, and was out with 'em on the ferryboat hunt, and right away after he up and left. Before night they wanted to lynch him, but he was gone, you see. Well, next day they found out the nigger was gone; they found out he hadn't ben seen sence ten o'clock the night the murder was done. So then they put it on him, you see; and while they was full of it, next day, back comes old Finn, and went boo-hooing to Judge Thatcher to get money to hunt for the nigger all over Illinois with. The judge gave him some, and that evening he got drunk, and was around till after midnight with a couple of mighty hard-looking strangers, and then went off with them. Well, he hain't come back sence, and they ain't looking for him back till this thing blows over a little, for people thinks now that he killed his boy and fixed things so folks would think robbers done it, and then he'd get Huck's money without having to bother a long time with a lawsuit. People do say he warn't any too good to do it. Oh, he's sly, I reckon. If he don't come back for a year he'll be all right. You can't prove anything on him, you know; everything will be quieted down then, and he'll walk in Huck's money as easy as nothing."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, you're innocent, ain't you! Does three hundred dollars lay around every day for people to pick up? Some folks think the nigger ain't far from here. I'm one of them – but I hain't talked it around. A few days ago I was talking with an old couple that lives next door in the log shanty, and they happened to say hardly anybody ever goes to that island over yonder that they call Jackson's Island. Don't anybody live there? says I. No, nobody, says they. I didn't say any more, but I done some thinking. I was pretty near certain I'd seen smoke over there, about the head of the island, a day or two before that, so I says to myself, like as not that nigger's hiding over there; anyway, says I, it's worth the trouble to give the place a hunt. I hain't seen any smoke sence, so I reckon maybe he's gone, if it was him; but husband's going over to see – him and another man. He was gone up the river; but he got back to-day, and I told him as soon as he got here two hours ago."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“啊，你可真是不懂事啊！难道三百大洋是能天天摆在那里让人随手一拣就到手的么？有些人认为那个黑奴离这儿不远呢。我就是其中的一个——不过我没有到处说就是了。才几天前，我对隔壁木棚里的一对老年夫妇说过话，他们随口讲到，人们如今没有去附近那个叫做杰克逊岛的小岛。我问道，那里有人住么？他们说没有。我没有接下去说什么，不过我倒是想过一想的。我可以十分肯定，我曾望见过那儿冒烟，是在岛的尖端那边，时间是在这以前的一两天。我因此上曾自个儿盘算过，那个黑奴多半就在那边啊。这样就值得花工夫到岛上去来个搜捕，在这以后，就没有再见到冒烟了。我寻思，说不定他溜走了，要是他就是那个黑奴的话。不过，我丈夫反正就要上那边去看一趟——他和另外一个人要去。他出门到上游去了，不过今天回来了，两个钟点以前，他一回到家，我就对他说过了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

She was right about the rats. You'd see one stick his nose out of a hole in the corner every little while. She said she had to have things handy to throw at them when she was alone, or they wouldn't give her no peace. She showed me a bar of lead twisted up into a knot, and said she was a good shot with it generly, but she'd wrenched her arm a day or two ago, and didn't know whether she could throw true now. But she watched for a chance, and directly banged away at a rat; but she missed him wide, and said "Ouch!" it hurt her arm so. Then she told me to try for the next one. I wanted to be getting away before the old man got back, but of course I didn't let on. I got the thing, and the first rat that showed his nose I let drive, and if he'd a stayed where he was he'd a been a tolerable sick rat. She said that was first-rate, and she reckoned I would hive the next one. She went and got the lump of lead and fetched it back, and brought along a hank of yarn which she wanted me to help her with.

I traveled nights, and hid daytimes and slept, and the bag of bread and meat I carried from home lasted me all the way, and I had a-plenty. I said I believed my uncle Abner Moore would take care of me, and so that was why I struck out for this town of Goshen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这样，我就说，事已如此，也不用再装了。还说，我会把一切的一切原原本本都倒给她听，只是她答应了的不许反悔。随后我告诉她，我父母双亡，按照法律，把我给栓住在乡下一个卑鄙的农民手里，离大河有三十英里。他虐待我，我再也不能忍受了。他出门几天，我便乘机偷了他女儿的几件旧衣服，溜出了家门。这三十英里，我走了三个晚上。我只在晚山走，白天躲起来，找地方睡，家里带出来的一袋面包和肉供我一路上食用。东西是足够的。我相信我的叔叔阿勃纳·摩尔会照看我的。这就是为什么我要上高申镇来。">查看中文翻译</div>

And don't go about women in that old calico. You do a girl tolerable poor, but you might fool men, maybe. Bless you, child, when you set out to thread a needle don't hold the thread still and fetch the needle up to it; hold the needle still and poke the thread at it; that's the way a woman most always does, but a man always does t'other way. And when you throw at a rat or anything, hitch yourself up a tiptoe and fetch your hand up over your head as awkward as you can, and miss your rat about six or seven foot. Throw stiff-armed from the shoulder, like there was a pivot there for it to turn on, like a girl; not from the wrist and elbow, with your arm out to one side, like a boy. And, mind you, when a girl tries to catch anything in her lap she throws her knees apart; she don't clap them together, the way you did when you catched the lump of lead. Why, I spotted you for a boy when you was threading the needle; and I contrived the other things just to make certain. Now trot along to your uncle, Sarah Mary Williams George Elexander Peters, and if you get into trouble you send word to Mrs. Judith Loftus, which is me, and I'll do what I can to get you out of it. Keep the river road all the way, and next time you tramp take shoes and socks with you. The river road's a rocky one, and your feet'll be in a condition when you get to Goshen, I reckon."</div>

<div class="line_en">I went up the bank about fifty yards, and then I doubled on my tracks and slipped back to where my canoe was, a good piece below the house. I jumped in, and was off in a hurry. I went up-stream far enough to make the head of the island, and then started across. I took off the sun-bonnet, for I didn't want no blinders on then. When I was about the middle I heard the clock begin to strike, so I stops and listens; the sound come faint over the water but clear – eleven. When I struck the head of the island I never waited to blow, though I was most winded, but I shoved right into the timber where my old camp used to be, and started a good fire there on a high and dry spot.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我沿河岸往上游走了五十码，然后急步走回来，溜到了系独木舟的地方，就是离那家人家相当远的一个去处。我跳上船，急急忙忙开船。我朝上水划了相当一段路，为的是能划到岛子的顶端，然后往对岸划去。我取下了遮阳帽，因为我这时候已经不需要这遮眼的东西了。我划到大河的水中央的时候，听到钟声响起来了。我便停了下来，仔细听着。声音从水上传来，很轻，可是很清楚——十一下子。我一到了岛尖，尽管累得喘不过气来，不敢停下来缓一口气，便直奔我早先宿营的林子那里，拣一个干燥的高处生起一堆大火。">查看中文翻译</div>

We put out the camp fire at the cavern the first thing, and didn't show a candle outside after that.</div>
