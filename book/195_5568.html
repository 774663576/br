<div class="line_en">The student was supposed to attend in the out-patients' room every day, see cases, and pick up what information he could; but on the days on which he clerked his duties were a little more definite. At that time the out-patients' department at St. Luke's consisted of three rooms, leading into one another, and a large, dark waiting-room with massive pillars of masonry and long benches. Here the patients waited after having been given their `letters' at mid-day; and the long rows of them, bottles and gallipots in hand, some tattered and dirty, others decent enough, sitting in the dimness, men and women of all ages, children, gave one an impression which was weird and horrible. They suggested the grim drawings of Daumier. All the rooms were painted alike, in salmon-colour with a high dado of maroon; and there was in them an odour of disinfectants, mingling as the afternoon wore on with the crude stench of humanity. The first room was the largest and in the middle of it were a table and an office chair for the physician; on each side of this were two smaller tables, a little lower: at one of these sat the house-physician and at the other the clerk who took the `book' for the day. This was a large volume in which were written down the name, age, sex, profession, of the patient and the diagnosis of his disease.</div>

<div class="line_en">At the beginning of the winter session Philip became an out-patients' clerk. There were three assistant-physicians who took out-patients, two days a week each, and Philip put his name down for Dr. Tyrell. He was popular with the students, and there was some competition to be his clerk. Dr. Tyrell was a tall, thin man of thirty-five, with a very small head, red hair cut short, and prominent blue eyes: his face was bright scarlet. He talked well in a pleasant voice, was fond of a little joke, and treated the world lightly. He was a successful man, with a large consulting practice and a knighthood in prospect. From commerce with students and poor people he had the patronising air, and from dealing always with the sick he had the healthy man's jovial condescension, which some consultants achieve as the professional manner. He made the patient feel like a boy confronted by a jolly schoolmaster; his illness was an absurd piece of naughtiness which amused rather than irritated.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="冬季学期一开始，菲利普成了门诊医师的助理。门诊部一共有三个助理医师，每人每周负责坐诊两天，菲利普跟在蒂勒尔医生下面学习。蒂勒尔医生很受学生欢迎，想做他的学徒还得经过一番竞争才行。他时年四十五岁，个子高高瘦瘦，脑袋很小，满头红发剪得极短，蓝色的眼珠往外凸着，脸色酡红。说话时语调活泼轻巧，喜欢讲笑话，对人情世事豁达宽恕。他是个事业有成的男人，从医多年，救死扶伤无数，有望受封骑士头衔。由于经常和穷人、学生打交道，他自然养成一种高高在上却体贴和善的态度。病人见得多了，他一个身强体壮的人深谙知足常乐之理，愿意屈尊俯就，为病人着想。这种态度常被一些医生视作专业的标识。他使病人觉得自己好像是闯了祸的学生，正站在笑眯眯的校长面前，而疾病不过是因为调皮捣蛋犯下的错，有趣却不致人发怒。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At half past one the house-physician came in, rang the bell, and told the porter to send in the old patients. There were always a good many of these, and it was necessary to get through as many of them as possible before Dr. Tyrell came at two. The H. P. with whom Philip came in contact was a dapper little man, excessively conscious of his importance: he treated the clerks with condescension and patently resented the familiarity of older students who had been his contemporaries and did not use him with the respect he felt his present position demanded. He set about the cases. A clerk helped him. The patients streamed in. The men came first. Chronic bronchitis, "a nasty 'acking cough," was what they chiefly suffered from; one went to the H. P. and the other to the clerk, handing in their letters: if they were going on well the words Rep 14 were written on them, and they went to the dispensary with their bottles or gallipots in order to have medicine given them for fourteen days more. Some old stagers held back so that they might be seen by the physician himself, but they seldom succeeded in this; and only three or four, whose condition seemed to demand his attention, were kept.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="住院医师下午一点半来，先摇铃让护工把老病号唤进来。数量还真不少，要赶在两点蒂勒尔医生上班前尽量多打发走几个。和菲利普共事的住院医师是个干净利落的矮个小伙，自视甚高，总对助理摆出居高临下的臭架子。几个和他年纪相仿的大龄学生喜欢套近乎，并没有因为他是医师而表示出应有的尊敬。他把对这些人的埋怨统统写在脸上。开始看病了，助手在一旁帮着医师诊断。病人络绎不绝。最先进来的是男病号，他们得的都是慢性支气管炎，“剧烈、持续的咳嗽”是主要症状。每次进来两个人，分别把挂号证递给住院医师和医师助手。要是他们的病情有所好转，就在病历上写上“14”，让他们拿着药瓶药罐再去领十四天的药。有些老油子拼命往后挤，想过一会儿等蒂勒尔医生给他们看病，但是这种做法很少奏效，只有三四个人的病情值得让医生亲自上阵瞧瞧。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They came in one by one and walked up to the table at which sat Dr. Tyrell. They were old men and young men and middle-aged men, mostly of the labouring class, dock labourers, draymen, factory hands, barmen; but some, neatly dressed, were of a station which was obviously superior, shop-assistants, clerks, and the like. Dr. Tyrell looked at these with suspicion. Sometimes they put on shabby clothes in order to pretend they were poor; but he had a keen eye to prevent what he regarded as fraud and sometimes refused to see people who, he thought, could well pay for medical attendance. Women were the worst offenders and they managed the thing more clumsily. They would wear a cloak and a skirt which were almost in rags, and neglect to take the rings off their fingers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们一个一个按顺序走进诊室，坐在蒂勒尔医生的桌前。这些人里有年轻的，也有老的，还有中等年纪的，大多都是些干体力活的，码头小工啦、马车车夫啦、工厂工人啦、酒馆侍者啦等等，还有一些穿戴整齐的人，显然等级更高一些，像什么商场店员和办公室职员之类。蒂勒尔总是一脸狐疑地打量着这些人。有时候他们故意穿得破破烂烂装成穷人，可蒂勒尔天生目光敏锐，一眼就能识出骗子。有时他觉得一些人应该能支付得起医疗费，就干脆拒绝给他们看病。女人是最可恶的惯犯，又天生愚不可及，总是要露出些狐狸尾巴。她们刻意穿上打满补丁的外套和裙子，但却忘了把手指上的戒指摘下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dr. Tyrell came in with quick movements and a breezy manner. He reminded one slightly of a clown leaping into the arena of a circus with the cry: Here we are again. His air seemed to indicate: What's all this nonsense about being ill? I'll soon put that right. He took his seat, asked if there were any old patients for him to see, rapidly passed them in review, looking at them with shrewd eyes as he discussed their symptoms, cracked a joke (at which all the clerks laughed heartily) with the H. P., who laughed heartily too but with an air as if he thought it was rather impudent for the clerks to laugh, remarked that it was a fine day or a hot one, and rang the bell for the porter to show in the new patients.</div>

<div class="line_en">Dr. Tyrell gave each of his clerks a case to examine. The clerk took the patient into one of the inner rooms; they were smaller, and each had a couch in it covered with black horse-hair: he asked his patient a variety of questions, examined his lungs, his heart, and his liver, made notes of fact on the hospital letter, formed in his own mind some idea of the diagnosis, and then waited for Dr. Tyrell to come in. This he did, followed by a small crowd of students, when he had finished the men, and the clerk read out what he had learned. The physician asked him one or two questions, and examined the patient himself. If there was anything interesting to hear students applied their stethoscope: you would see a man with two or three to the chest, and two perhaps to his back, while others waited impatiently to listen. The patient stood among them a little embarrassed, but not altogether displeased to find himself the centre of attention: he listened confusedly while Dr. Tyrell discoursed glibly on the case. Two or three students listened again to recognise the murmur or the crepitation which the physician described, and then the man was told to put on his clothes.</div>

<div class="line_en">When the various cases had been examined Dr. Tyrell went back into the large room and sat down again at his desk. He asked any student who happened to be standing near him what he would prescribe for a patient he had just seen. The student mentioned one or two drugs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="等这几个病例都诊断完，蒂勒尔医生又回到那间大屋，坐回到自己的椅子上。他随口提问站在身边的学生，应该给刚才那个病人开些什么药。学生给出了一个处方，提出一两种药的名字来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This always made the students laugh, and with a twinkle of amusement at his own bright humour the physician prescribed some other drug than that which the student had suggested. When there were two cases of exactly the same sort and the student proposed the treatment which the physician had ordered for the first, Dr. Tyrell exercised considerable ingenuity in thinking of something else. Sometimes, knowing that in the dispensary they were worked off their legs and preferred to give the medicines which they had all ready, the good hospital mixtures which had been found by the experience of years to answer their purpose so well, he amused himself by writing an elaborate prescription.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="学生们哄堂大笑，医生调皮地眨眨眼睛，给出了和学生意见全然不同的几味药。有时候两个病人的病情一模一样，学生照着他之前的处方给药，可他偏要别出心裁，想个不一样的方子。医院的药剂师经常忙得叫苦连天，想优先采用之前已经配好的药方，最好是医院用了好几年，一直疗效不错的那种。蒂勒尔医生明知这一点，还经常写些复杂难配的处方来自娱自乐。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They entered. With the men the most common ailments were due to the excessive use of alcohol, but with the women they were due to defective nourishment. By about six o'clock they were finished. Philip, exhausted by standing all the time, by the bad air, and by the attention he had given, strolled over with his fellow-clerks to the Medical School to have tea. He found the work of absorbing interest. There was humanity there in the rough, the materials the artist worked on; and Philip felt a curious thrill when it occurred to him that he was in the position of the artist and the patients were like clay in his hands. He remembered with an amused shrug of the shoulders his life in Paris, absorbed in colour, tone, values, Heaven knows what, with the aim of producing beautiful things: the directness of contact with men and women gave a thrill of power which he had never known. He found an endless excitement in looking at their faces and hearing them speak; they came in each with his peculiarity, some shuffling uncouthly, some with a little trip, others with heavy, slow tread, some shyly. Often you could guess their trades by the look of them. You learnt in what way to put your questions so that they should be understood, you discovered on what subjects nearly all lied, and by what inquiries you could extort the truth notwithstanding. You saw the different way people took the same things. The diagnosis of dangerous illness would be accepted by one with a laugh and a joke, by another with dumb despair. Philip found that he was less shy with these people than he had ever been with others; he felt not exactly sympathy, for sympathy suggests condescension; but he felt at home with them. He found that he was able to put them at their ease, and, when he had been given a case to find out what he could about it, it seemed to him that the patient delivered himself into his hands with a peculiar confidence.</div>

<div class="line_en">It seemed to Philip that he alone of the clerks saw the dramatic interest of those afternoons. To the others men and women were only cases, good if they were complicated, tiresome if obvious; they heard murmurs and were astonished at abnormal livers; an unexpected sound in the lungs gave them something to talk about. But to Philip there was much more. He found an interest in just looking at them, in the shape of their heads and their hands, in the look of their eyes and the length of their noses. You saw in that room human nature taken by surprise, and often the mask of custom was torn off rudely, showing you the soul all raw. Sometimes you saw an untaught stoicism which was profoundly moving. Once Philip saw a man, rough and illiterate, told his case was hopeless; and, self-controlled himself, he wondered at the splendid instinct which forced the fellow to keep a stiff upper-lip before strangers. But was it possible for him to be brave when he was by himself, face to face with his soul, or would he then surrender to despair? Sometimes there was tragedy. Once a young woman brought her sister to be examined, a girl of eighteen, with delicate features and large blue eyes, fair hair that sparkled with gold when a ray of autumn sunshine touched it for a moment, and a skin of amazing beauty. The students' eyes went to her with little smiles. They did not often see a pretty girl in these dingy rooms. The elder woman gave the family history, father and mother had died of phthisis, a brother and a sister, these two were the only ones left. The girl had been coughing lately and losing weight. She took off her blouse and the skin of her neck was like milk. Dr. Tyrell examined her quietly, with his usual rapid method; he told two or three of his clerks to apply their stethoscopes to a place he indicated with his finger; and then she was allowed to dress. The sister was standing a little apart and she spoke to him in a low voice, so that the girl should not hear. Her voice trembled with fear.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="菲利普觉得下午在医院值班非常有趣，可似乎自己是所有助理里唯一一个这么觉得的。对其他人来说，来看病的男人女人不过只是病号罢了，如果他们得了疑难杂症，就刚好可以研究一番。如果病情很普通，那诊断过程则会很无聊。他们听听心脏有没有杂音，偶尔发现肝脏不正常或者肺部有奇怪的声音就会大惊小怪地议论不休。可菲利普却能看到更多。他喜欢认真观察每个病人：头和手的形状、眼睛的样子、鼻子的长度。在诊室里经常能看到人在受到惊吓时的第一反应，那些常规的面具被残忍地撕扯下来，灵魂赤裸裸地暴露眼前。有时，本能的隐忍才是最为动人的一幕。菲利普接诊过一个大字不识的糙汉子，告诉他病情已经无药可救了。菲利普尽量把结果平静地传达出来，眼前这个男人在一群陌生人面前咬紧牙关，其坚强而伟大的本能反应让菲利普都惊讶不已。然而，当他独处一室，直面内心时，是否还能坚强如此？还是会向绝望投降？有时，这里会有悲剧上演。一个年轻女人带着妹妹来看病。女孩才十八岁，面孔精致，湛蓝的眼睛目光灼灼，浓密的秀发在秋日的阳光下闪耀着星星点点的金辉，皮肤白皙细腻，毫无瑕疵。所有学生的眼光都被她吸引过去，毕竟在这几间阴暗的小诊室里难得见到这样姿色不凡的姑娘。她姐姐讲了讲家里的事：父母都死于肺结核，还有一个哥哥和姐姐也都难逃厄运，最后只剩下她俩相依为命了。妹妹最近咳得厉害，体重一个劲儿往下掉。医生让小女孩脱下上衣，只见她颈子上的皮肤像牛奶一样洁白光亮。蒂勒尔医生默默地给她做检查，手法快而熟练，他指了指几个部位让助理拿听诊器听一下，然后让女孩穿上衣服。姐姐站在稍远的地方，压低声音询问医生，以免让妹妹听到什么动静。她害怕得声音都发抖了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She began to cry, while the doctor looked at her gravely; he thought she too had the type; she would not make old bones either. The girl turned round and saw her sister's tears. She understood what they meant. The colour fled from her lovely face and tears fell down her cheeks. The two stood for a minute or two, crying silently, and then the older, forgetting the indifferent crowd that watched them, went up to her, took her in her arms, and rocked her gently to and fro as if she were a baby.</div>

Complete rest was his only chance. The physician did not ask impossibilities.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sometimes there was comedy. Now and then came a flash of cockney humour, now and then some old lady, a character such as Charles Dickens might have drawn, would amuse them by her garrulous oddities. Once a woman came who was a member of the ballet at a famous music-hall. She looked fifty, but gave her age as twenty-eight. She was outrageously painted and ogled the students impudently with large black eyes; her smiles were grossly alluring. She had abundant self-confidence and treated Dr. Tyrell, vastly amused, with the easy familiarity with which she might have used an intoxicated admirer. She had chronic bronchitis, and told him it hindered her in the exercise of her profession.</div>

<div class="line_en">But on the whole the impression was neither of tragedy nor of comedy. There was no describing it. It was manifold and various; there were tears and laughter, happiness and woe; it was tedious and interesting and indifferent; it was as you saw it: it was tumultuous and passionate; it was grave; it was sad and comic; it was trivial; it was simple and complex; joy was there and despair; the love of mothers for their children, and of men for women; lust trailed itself through the rooms with leaden feet, punishing the guilty and the innocent, helpless wives and wretched children; drink seized men and women and cost its inevitable price; death sighed in these rooms; and the beginning of life, filling some poor girl with terror and shame, was diagnosed there. There was neither good nor bad there. There were just facts. It was life.</div>
