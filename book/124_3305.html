<div class="line_en">The hotel brought a breakfast to our room that, much to my delight, featured deli meat among many other denials of American breakfast constructions. The dress I'd planned to wear to meet Peter Van Houten had been moved up in the rotation for the Oranjee dinner, so after I showered and got my hair to lie halfway flat, I spent like thirty minutes debating with Mom the various benefits and drawbacks of the available outfits before deciding to dress as much like Anna in AIA as possible: Chuck Taylors and dark jeans like she always wore, and a light blue T-shirt.</div>

Augustus took me by one arm and grabbed the oxygen cart with the other, and we walked up the three steps to the lacquered blue-black front door. My heart pounded. One closed door away from the answers I'd dreamed of ever since I first read that last unfinished page.</div>

His face and belly were so round, and his arms so skinny, that he looked like a dough ball with four sticks stuck into it. "Mr. Van Houten?" Augustus asked, his voice squeaking a bit.</div>

Augustus and I were together in the Improbable Creatures Club: us and duck-billed platypuses.</div>

<div class="line_en">Of course, I had hoped that Peter Van Houten would be sane, but the world is not a wish-granting factory. The important thing was that the door was open and I was crossing the threshold to learn what happens after the end of An Imperial Affliction. That was enough. We followed him and Lidewij inside, past a huge oak dining room table with only two chairs, into a creepily sterile living room. It looked like a museum, except there was no art on the empty white walls. Aside from one couch and one lounge chair, both a mix of steel and black leather, the room seemed empty. Then I noticed two large black garbage bags, full and twist-tied, behind the couch.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当然啦，我本来希望彼得·范·豪滕是个神志正常的老人家，不过这世界又不是批量满足心愿的大工厂。最重要的是，大门敞开，我已经迈过了通向《无比美妙的痛苦》结尾之后故事的门槛。这就足够了。我们跟着他和李德薇进了屋，路过一张只有两把椅子的巨大橡木餐桌，来到一个简洁得令人脊背发毛的客厅。这儿看起来就像个美术馆，只不过空落落的白墙上没有一张美术作品。除了一张长沙发和一把安乐椅（都是不锈钢和黑色真皮材质），房间里似乎一无所有。然后我注意到，沙发背后有两个大大的黑色垃圾袋，装得满满的，扎着口。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Fan mail," Van Houten answered as he sat down in the lounge chair. "Eighteen years' worth of it. Can't open it. Terrifying. Yours are the first missives to which I have replied, and look where that got me. I frankly find the reality of readers wholly unappetizing."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“读者来信。”范·豪滕说着坐进安乐椅，“十八年来的读者来信。没法拆开。可怕极了。我回复的第一拨长函就是你们的，可你们瞧，让我落到什么地步。坦白地说，现实中的读者委实令我感觉索然无味。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That explained why he'd never replied to my letters: He'd never read them. I wondered why he kept them at all, let alone in an otherwise empty formal living room.

<div class="line_cn" title="“我还觉得太阳已经升起来了呢。”李德薇说。话虽如此，她还是转身去客厅的吧台伸手拿了一瓶威士忌，往玻璃杯里倒入半杯，然后把酒拿给他。彼得·范·豪滕浅啜一口，在椅子上坐直身体。“这么好的酒理当以最好的姿势品尝。”他说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"True," Lidewij said. "I do not know how you go on, without your family. I do not know." As I read about each of the seven who died, I thought of Otto Frank not being a father anymore, left with a diary instead of a wife and two daughters. At the end of the hallway, a huge book, bigger than a dictionary, contained the names of the 103,000 dead from the Netherlands in the Holocaust. (Only 5,000 of the deported Dutch Jews, a wall label explained, had survived. 5,000 Otto Franks.) The book was turned to the page with Anne Frank's name, but what got me about it was the fact that right beneath her name there were four Aron Franks. Four. Four Aron Franks without museums, without historical markers, without anyone to mourn them. I silently resolved to remember and pray for the four Aron Franks as long as I was around. (Maybe some people need to believe in a proper and omnipotent God to pray, but I don't.)</div>
