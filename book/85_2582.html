<div class="line_en">The cake reads "Good luck! Fight hard!" and on the side, along the vanilla-frosted edge, someone has added the words, "Come home soon," in blue squiggly letters, but the "o-o-n" is squeezed together, so it reads more like "son" or "Come home son."</div>

<div class="line_en">Eddie squeezed the trigger. Whoosh. The fire shot up quickly. The bamboo was dry, and within a minute the walls of the barn were melting in orange and yellow flames. Off in the distance, Eddie heard the rumble of an engine -- the Captain, he hoped, had found something to escape in -- and then, suddenly, from the skies, the first sounds of bombing, the noise they had been hearing every night. It was even closer now, and Eddie realized whoever it was would see the flames. They might be rescued. He might be going home! He turned to the burning barn and… What was that?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱迪扳动了喷火器的扳机。呼——火焰马上蹿了起来。竹子很干燥，顷刻间，谷仓仓壁便消失在橘黄色的火焰里。爱迪听到远处传来马达的轰隆声——他希望，上尉找到了他们可以乘坐逃走的东西——然后，天空突然传来了第一声炮响，这是他们最近每天晚上听到的声音。这会儿，声音更靠近了。爱迪意识到，不管那是什么人，都可能看到这里的火光。没准儿，他们能被营救出去。他可以回家了！他朝着正在燃烧的谷仓转过身来…那是什么？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Eddie watched, sneered, then moved down the path to the final hut. It was larger, more like a barn, and he lifted his weapon. This was over, he said to himself. Over. All these weeks and months in the hands of those bastards, those subhuman guards with their bad teeth and bony faces and the dead hornets in their soup. He didn't know what would happen to them next, but it could not be any worse than what they had endured.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱迪望着，轻蔑地一笑，然后，循着小路来到最后一个竹棚前。这个竹棚大些，更像一个谷仓，爱迪举起了喷火器。结束了，他自言自语道。终于结束了。这么多个日日夜夜，落在那些王八蛋的手里，那些牙齿歪斜、面目枯瘦、没有人味的看守，还有他们汤里的黄蜂。他不知道下面还会发生什么事情，但起码不会比他们已经经历过的事情更糟。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In truth, the bullet had never been fully removed. It had cut through several nerves and tendons and shattered against a bone, fracturing it vertically. Eddie had two surgeries. Neither cured the problem. The doctors said he'd be left with a limp, one likely to get worse with age as the misshapen bones deteriorated. "The best we can do," he was told. Was it? Who could say? All Eddie knew was that he'd awoken in a medical unit and his life was never the same. His running was over. His dancing was over. Worse, for some reason, the way he used to feel about things was over, too. He withdrew. Things seemed silly or pointless. War had crawled inside of Eddie, in his leg and in his soul. He learned many things as a soldier. He came home a different man.</div>

<div class="line_en">There was a gate, a makeshift thing of wood and wire, but because the ground dropped off sharply on both sides, they could not go around it. The Captain grabbed a rifle and jumped out. He shot the lock and pushed the gate open. He motioned for Morton to take the wheel, then pointed to his eyes, signaling he would check the path ahead, which curled into a thicket of trees. He ran, as best he could in his bare feet, 50 yards beyond the turn in the road.</div>

<div class="line_en">The land mine exploded instantly, like a burping flame from the earth's core.
