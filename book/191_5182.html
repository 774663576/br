<div class="line_en">Dorothy lived in the midst of the great Kansas prairies, with Uncle Henry, who was a farmer, and Aunt Em, who was the farmer's wife.</div>

<div class="line_en">Their house was small, for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon many miles. There were four walls, a floor and a roof, which made one room; and this room contained a rusty looking cookstove, a cupboard for the dishes, a table, three or four chairs, and the beds.</div>

<div class="line_en">Uncle Henry and Aunt Em had a big bed in one corner, and Dorothy a little bed in another corner.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="亨利叔叔和爱姆婶婶睡的大床，放在角落里，多萝茜睡的小床，放在另外一个角落里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was no garret at all, and no cellar -- except a small hole dug in the ground, called a cyclone cellar, where the family could go in case one of those great whirlwinds arose, mighty enough to crush any building in its path. It was reached by a trap door in the middle of the floor, from which a ladder led down into the small, dark hole.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="屋子里没有阁楼，也没有地下室，只有那么一个小洞，直掘到地面下，这洞叫做“旋风的地洞”。倘若大旋风刮来时，全家人可以躲进里面去，因为在旋风经过的途中，不论什么屋子它都能够吹倒。在地板的中央，装着一扇活动的木门，那里有一座梯子，走下去就到了那又小又黑的地洞里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When Dorothy stood in the doorway and looked around, she could see nothing but the great gray prairie on every side. Not a tree nor a house broke the broad sweep of flat country that reached to the edge of the sky in all directions. The sun had baked the plowed land into a gray mass, with little cracks running through it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当多萝茜站在门口，向四周眺望时，除了四周都是灰色的大草原以外，什么也看不见。在那一片宽阔平坦的原野上没有一棵树，也没有一间小屋子。每一个方向，都一直伸展到天边。那太阳烤炙着这耕作过的田地，使它变成为一片灰色的有许多裂缝的荒土。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Even the grass was not green, for the sun had burned the tops of the long blades until they were the same gray color to be seen everywhere. Once the house had been painted, but the sun blistered the paint and the rains washed it away, and now the house was as dull and gray as everything else.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="即使是草也不绿，因为太阳烤炙着它们的顶部长叶，使得它们不论从何处看起来，同样的都是灰色的。有一次，屋子油漆过了，但是太阳把油漆晒起了泡，雨把它洗干净了，如今这屋子也像其他东西一样地暗淡和灰色了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="当爱姆婶婶初到这里来的时候，是一个年轻的美丽的妻子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The sun and wind had changed her, too. They had taken the sparkle from her eyes and left them a sober gray; they had taken the red from her cheeks and lips, and they were gray also. She was thin and gaunt, and never smiled now.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="太阳和风也把她的样儿改变了。它们从她的服睛里，拿走了光辉，留下了一种沉重的灰色；从她的面颊上和嘴唇上，拿走了红润，也只剩灰色了。如今她消瘦而且憔悴，不再微笑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When Dorothy, who was an orphan, first came to her, Aunt Em had been so startled by the child's laughter that she would scream and press her hand upon her heart whenever Dorothy's merry voice reached her ears; and she still looked at the little girl with wonder that she could find anything to laugh at.</div>

<div class="line_en">Uncle Henry never laughed. He worked hard from morning till night and did not know what joy was. He was gray also, from his long beard to his rough boots, and he looked stern and solemn, and rarely spoke.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was Toto that made Dorothy laugh, and saved her from growing as gray as her other surroundings. Toto was not gray; he was a little black dog, with long silky hair and small black eyes that twinkled merrily on either side of his funny, wee nose. Toto played all day long, and Dorothy played with him, and loved him dearly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="引得多萝茜好笑的是托托，在周围的一切事物都同样地逐渐变成灰色的环境中，托托不是灰色的；它是一只小黑狗，有着柔软滑润的长毛，一双黑的小眼睛，在它那有趣的极小的鼻子两边，快乐地眨着。托托整天地玩着，多萝茜跟它在一块儿玩着，并且十分喜欢它。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Today, however, they were not playing. Uncle Henry sat upon the doorstep and looked anxiously at the sky, which was even grayer than usual.</div>

<div class="line_en">Dorothy caught Toto at last and started to follow her aunt. When she was halfway across the room there came a great shriek from the wind, and the house shook so hard that she lost her footing and sat down suddenly upon the floor.</div>

<div class="line_en">The north and south winds met where the house stood, and made it the exact center of the cyclone. In the middle of a cyclone the air is generally still, but the great pressure of the wind on every side of the house raised it up higher and higher, until it was at the very top of the cyclone; and there it remained and was carried miles and miles away as easily as you could carry a feather.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那南方的和北方的风，在屋子的地方会合着，形成了旋风的中心。在旋风的中央，那空气通常是平静的，但是四周的强大风力压迫着这屋子，使它更高更高地上升起来，直升到旋风的最高顶；屋子在空中好几里好几里地被带走，轻易得像你带走一根羽毛。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was very dark, and the wind howled horribly around her, but Dorothy found she was riding quite easily. After the first few whirls around, and one other time when the house tipped badly, she felt as if she were being rocked gently, like a baby in a cradle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时候，天空非常黑暗，风在她的四周可怕地怒吼着。但是多萝茜乘坐得十分舒服。在第一次稍微旋转以后，当那屋子剧烈地倾斜时，她似乎觉得自己被徐缓地摇荡着，像一个婴儿躺在一只摇篮里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Toto did not like it. He ran about the room, now here, now there, barking loudly; but Dorothy sat quite still on the floor and waited to see what would happen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="托托不喜欢这样子摇荡。它满屋子奔走着，一会儿这里，一会儿那里，大声地吠着；但是多萝茜在地板上坐得十分安静，等着看看有什么事情发生。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Once Toto got too near the open trap door, and fell in; and at first the little girl thought she had lost him. But soon she saw one of his ears sticking up through the hole, for the strong pressure of the air was keeping him up so that he could not fall.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有一次，托托太靠近那打开着的活动地板的门，并且掉了下去；这小女孩子起初想它是掉下去了。但是过了一会儿，她看见了它的一只耳朵，在洞口竖起，强大的空 气压力托住了它，使得它掉不下去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She crept to the hole, caught Toto by the ear, and dragged him into the room again, afterward closing the trap door so that no more accidents could happen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她就爬到洞口，捉住了托托的耳朵，再把它拉进屋子里来，关上了那活动的地板门，使得以后再不会发生意外的事情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Hour after hour passed away, and slowly Dorothy got over her fright; but she felt quite lonely, and the wind shrieked so loudly all about her that she nearly became deaf.</div>

<div class="line_en">At first she had wondered if she would be dashed to pieces when the house fell again; but as the hours passed and nothing terrible happened, she stopped worrying and resolved to wait calmly and see what the future would bring.</div>

<div class="line_en">At last she crawled over the swaying floor to her bed, and lay down upon it; and Toto followed and lay down beside her.</div>
