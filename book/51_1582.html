<div class="line_en">I enter a nightmare from which I wake repeatedly only to find a greater terror awaiting me. All the things I dread most, all the things I dread for others manifest in such vivid detail I can't help but believe they're real. Each time I wake, I think, At last, this is over, but it isn't. It's only the beginning of a new chapter of torture. How many ways do I watch Prim die? Relive my father's last moments? Feel my own body ripped apart? This is the nature of the tracker jacker venom, so carefully created to target the place where fear lives in your brain.</div>

<div class="line_en">When I finally do come to my senses, I lie still, waiting for the next onslaught of imagery. But eventually I accept that the poison must have finally worked its way out of my system, leaving my body wracked and feeble. I'm still lying on my side, locked in the fetal position. I lift a hand to my eyes to find them sound, untouched by ants that never existed. Simply stretching out my limbs requires an enormous effort. So many parts of me hurt, it doesn't seem worthwhile taking inventory of them. Very, very slowly I manage to sit up. I'm in a shallow hole, not filled with the humming orange bubbles of my hallucination but with old, dead leaves. My clothing's damp, but I don't know whether pond water, dew, rain, or sweat is the cause. For a long time, all I can do is take tiny sips from my bottle and watch a beetle crawl up the side of a honeysuckle bush.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当我的意识渐渐恢复时，我仍静静地躺着，等着下一次可怕记忆袭来，但终于，我感觉蜂毒的不良后果已经慢慢消失，身体极度疲乏衰弱。我仰面躺着，保持着胎儿的姿势，把手举到眼前，能看见，蚂蚁不存在，也没碰我眼睛。仅仅伸开四肢就费了好大力气，我浑身——身体的每一个部位——都极其疼痛，我慢慢、慢慢地坐起来。我刚才躺在一个浅坑里，里面也没有幻觉中的橘红色泡泡，而是一堆落叶。我的衣服很湿，不知是池塘的水、还是露水、抑或是雨水或汗水把它打湿了。很长时间，我能做的只是吮吸着瓶子里的水，看着一只蜜蜂在身旁的金银花丛中飞动。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A foul, rotten taste pervades my mouth, and the water has little effect on it. I drag myself over to the honeysuckle bush and pluck a flower. I gently pull the stamen through the blossom and set the drop of nectar on my tongue. The sweetness spreads through my mouth, down my throat, warming my veins with memories of summer, and my home woods and Gale's presence beside me. For some reason, our discussion from that last morning comes back to me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我的嘴里满是腐烂的臭味，喝水也不管用。我爬到金银花丛，摘了一朵花，轻轻地拔出花蕊，把花蜜滴在舌头上。甜甜的味道在口中散开，顺喉而下，它把我带回夏天的美好记忆中，我想起了家乡的丛林和盖尔，想起我们临别那天早晨说的话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">How long have I been out? It was morning when I lost reason. Now it's afternoon. But the stiffness in my joints suggests more than a day has passed, even two possibly. If so, I'll have no way of knowing which tributes survived that tracker jacker attack. Not Glimmer or the girl from District 4. But there was the boy from District 1, both tributes from District 2, and Peeta. Did they die from the stings? Certainly if they lived, their last days must have been as horrid as my own. And what about Rue? She's so small, it wouldn't take much venom to do her in. But then again… the tracker jackers would've had to catch her, and she had a good head start.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我意识混乱有多长时间了？我失去正常意识是在今天早上，现在已到了下午，可僵硬的关节让我感觉过去了不止一天，甚至可能是两天。这么说，我无法知晓追踪蜂究竟蜇死了几个职业选手。除去格丽默和四区的女孩，还有一区的男孩、二区的一男一女，还有皮塔。他们也因蜂毒而死去了吗？当然，如果他们还活着，前两天也一定和我的处境一样恐怖。露露怎么样了呢？她那么娇小，无需很多蜂毒就能要了她的命。可是…追踪蜂也许不会蜇她，因为她所处位置很有利。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And suddenly, I'm not thinking of Gale but of Peeta and… Peeta! He saved my life! I think. Because by the time we met up, I couldn't tell what was real and what the tracker jacker venom had caused me to imagine. But if he did, and my instincts tell me he did, what for? Is he simply working the Lover Boy angle he initiated at the interview? Or was he actually trying to protect me? And if he was, what was he doing with those Careers in the first place? None of it makes sense.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然，我的思维不在盖尔那里，而到了皮塔那里。皮塔…！“他救了我的命！”我在心里思量着。我们相遇时，我不知道什么是真实的，什么是蜂毒导致的幻象。可如果他真的救了我昵？我的直觉告诉我这是真的。可为什么？是在扮演电视访谈时他自己说起的天使吗？或者就是为了保护我？如果是，那他怎么会和那帮人混在一起？所有的解释都不成立。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So I focus on the one really good thing that's happened since I landed in the arena. I have a bow and arrows! A full dozen arrows if you count the one I retrieved in the tree. They bear no trace of the noxious green slime that came from Glimmer's body -- which leads me to believe that might not have been wholly real -- but they have a fair amount of dried blood on them. I can clean them later, but I do take a minute to shoot a few into a nearby tree. They are more like the weapons in the Training Center than my ones at home, but who cares? That I can work with.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我又想起进入竞技场后最好的一件事，那就是弓箭！我数一数，算上在树上拔的那支，一共有十二支箭。箭上没有一点格丽默身上的绿色毒液，我觉得肯定是幻觉。但箭上有很多血，我可以以后再把它洗掉。我朝附近的林子射了几支箭，与我在家的弓箭相比，它与竞技场的那把弓箭感觉更相似。谁在乎呢？能用就行。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The weapons give me an entirely new perspective on the Games. I know I have tough opponents left to face. But I am no longer merely prey that runs and hides or takes desperate measures. If Cato broke through the trees right now, I wouldn't flee, I'd shoot. I find I'm actually anticipating the moment with pleasure.</div>

<div class="line_en">But first, I have to get some strength back in my body. I'm very dehydrated again and my water supply is dangerously low. The little padding I was able to put on by gorging myself during prep time in the Capitol is gone, plus several more pounds as well. My hip bones and ribs are more prominent than I remember them being since those awful months after my father's death. And then there are my wounds to contend with -- burns, cuts, and bruises from smashing into the trees, and three tracker jacker stings, which are as sore and swollen as ever. I treat my burns with the ointment and try dabbing a bit on my stings as well, but it has no effect on them. My mother knew a treatment for them, some type of leaf that could draw out the poison, but she seldom had cause to use it, and I don't even remember its name let alone its appearance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是，我要先恢复体力，我的身体已严重缺水，瓶子里的水也即将告罄。参赛前在凯匹特猛吃猛喝所增加的几磅重量，现在已消耗殆尽。我臀部的骨头和肋骨比爸爸过世时那段艰难的日子还要突出，还浑身是伤——烧伤、划伤、撞在树上的淤青、黄蜂蜇的毒包。毒包比以前更肿更疼，我用药膏治疗烧伤，把毒包挑开，可没太大效果。妈妈知道治疗毒包的方法，用一种草药能把毒液吸出来，但很少有机会使用这方法，而我甚至不记得草药的名字，更不用说它的外观了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Water first, I think. You can hunt along the way now. It's easy to see the direction I came from by the path of destruction my crazed body made through the foliage. So I walk off in the other direction, hoping my enemies still lie locked in the surreal world of tracker jacker venom.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“首先要弄到水。”我思忖着，“然后可以边走边打猎。”从我蹒跚走过时踩倒的草很容易判断刚才行走的方向，所以我朝另一个方向走去，寄希望于对手蜂毒仍在发作。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I can't move too quickly, my joints reject any abrupt motions. But I establish the slow hunter's tread I use when tracking game. Within a few minutes, I spot a rabbit and make my first kill with the bow and arrow. It's not my usual clean shot through the eye, but I'll take it. After about an hour, I find a stream, shallow but wide, and more than sufficient for my needs. The sun's hot and severe, so while I wait for my water to purify I strip down to my underclothes and wade into the mild current. I'm filthy from head to toe. I try splashing myself but eventually just lie down in the water for a few minutes, letting it wash off the soot and blood and skin that has started to peel off my burns. After rinsing out my clothes and hanging them on bushes to dry, I sit on the bank in the sun for a bit, untangling my hair with my fingers. My appetite returns and I eat a cracker and a strip of beef. With a handful of moss, I polish the blood from my silver weapons.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我走不快，只要猛动关节就会疼痛，于是我采用平时捕猎时慢走的办法。没过几分钟，我就发现一只兔子，用箭打到了它。箭并没有像往常那样干净利索地从兔子眼睛里穿过，可没关系。走了大约一个小时，我发现了一条小溪，很浅，但很宽，足够我用的。阳光炙热，在给水消毒的当儿，我脱掉外衣，趟到缓缓的溪水里。我浑身上下脏极了，我把水撩到身上，冲洗着身上的泥垢，最后索性在水里躺了几分钟，让溪水把我身上的烟尘、血迹和烧伤脱落的死皮冲掉。我接着又洗了洗衣服，之后放在树丛里晾着。我坐在有阳光的岸边，用手把辫子拆开。肚子又咕咕叫了，吃了几块饼干和一点牛肉，然后抓起一把青苔，把银色弓箭上的血洗刷干净。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In one motion, I turn to the sound, bringing the bow and arrow to my shoulder. There's no one there. No one I can see anyway. Then I spot the tip of a child's boot just peeking out from behind the trunk of a tree. My shoulders relax and I grin. She can move through the woods like a shadow, you have to give her that. How else could she have followed me? The words come out of my mouth before I can stop them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我反应很快，立刻转向发出声音的方向，把弓箭背到背上。没有人，至少我没看见人，接着我看到一个小孩靴子尖从树后露出来。我立刻放松下来，咧开嘴笑了。她可以像影子一样在林子里移动，这么说是公平的，不然她怎么可能一直跟着我？我不由得说道：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Refreshed, I treat my burns again, braid back my hair, and dress in the damp clothes, knowing the sun will dry them soon enough. Following the stream against its current seems the smartest course of action. I'm traveling uphill now, which I prefer, with a source of fresh water not only for myself but possible game. I easily take out a strange bird that must be some form of wild turkey. Anyway, it looks plenty edible to me. By late afternoon, I decide to build a small fire to cook the meat, betting that dusk will help conceal the smoke and I can quench the fire by nightfall. I clean the game, taking extra care with the bird, but there's nothing alarming about it. Once the feathers are plucked, it's no bigger than a chicken, but it's plump and firm. I've just placed the first lot over the coals when I hear the twig snap.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在我的精神振作起来，我处理了烧伤，梳好头发，穿上潮湿的衣服——太阳一会儿就会把它晒干。现在顺着溪流走似乎是最聪明的选择，我正在向山上走，这是我喜欢的方向。我要喝溪水，猎物也要喝。我很快又打到一只像火鸡一样的鸟，它看上去可以吃。到了傍晚，我准备生火烤肉，借着黄昏容易隐藏烟雾，到晚上，我再把火扑灭。我宰杀、清洗猎物，对那只鸟特别小心，但它看上去应该没问题，拔掉毛以后，跟鸡差不多大，只不过肉更肥、更硬实。我把肉放在火上烤，突然听到嫩树枝发出的噼啪声。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I can tell by her expression that it's not that uncommon an occurrence. A public whipping's a rare thing in District 12, although occasionally one occurs. Technically, Gale and I could be whipped on a daily basis for poaching in the woods -- well, technically, we could get a whole lot worse -- except all the officials buy our meat. Besides, our mayor, Madge's father, doesn't seem to have much taste for such events. Maybe being the least prestigious, poorest, most ridiculed district in the country has its advantages. Such as, being largely ignored by the Capitol as long as we produce our coal quotas.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我从她的表情可以看出这种事经常发生。当众鞭打在十二区很少发生，尽管有时也会有。照那么说，我和盖尔因为在树林中偷猎天天都要挨鞭子，我挨的更多；不过那些当官的要吃肉、买肉；再说，我们的市长，也就是马奇的爸爸，对这类事情不感兴趣。作为全国最没名气、最穷、也最常遭讪笑的区，也许有它一定的好处，只要我们完成自己的生产配额，凯匹特就不再理会我们了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It's interesting, hearing about her life. We have so little communication with anyone outside our district.

<div class="line_en">"Oh, yes, we have them back home. I've been eating them for days," she says, popping a handful in her mouth. I tentatively bite into one, and it's as good as our blackberries. Taking Rue on as an ally seems a better choice all the time. We divide up our food supplies, so in case we're separated, we'll both be set for a few days. Apart from the food, Rue has a small water skin, a homemade slingshot, and an extra pair of socks. She also has a sharp shard of rock she uses as a knife. "I know it's not much," she says as if embarrassed, "but I had to get away from the Cornucopia fast."</div>
