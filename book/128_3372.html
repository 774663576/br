<div class="line_en">I made it very snappy on the phone because I was afraid my parents would barge in on me right in the middle of it. They didn't, though. Mr. Antolini was very nice. He said I could come right over if I wanted to. I think I probably woke he and his wife up, because it took them a helluva long time to answer the phone. The first thing he asked me was if anything was wrong, and I said no. I said I'd flunked out of Pencey, though. I thought I might as well tell him. He said "Good God," when I said that. He had a good sense of humor and all. He told me to come right over if I felt like it.</div>

<div class="line_en">He was about the best teacher I ever had, Mr. Antolini. He was a pretty young guy, not much older than my brother D. B., and you could kid around with him without losing your respect for him. He was the one that finally picked up that boy that jumped out the window I told you about, James Castle. Old Mr. Antolini felt his pulse and all, and then he took off his coat and put it over James Castle and carried him all the way over to the infirmary. He didn't even give a damn if his coat got all bloody.</div>

<div class="line_en">When I got back to D. B.'s room, old Phoebe'd turned the radio on. This dance music was coming out. She'd turned it on low, though, so the maid wouldn't hear it. You should've seen her. She was sitting smack in the middle of the bed, outside the covers, with her legs folded like one of those Yogi guys. She was listening to the music. She kills me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我回到DB房里的时候，发现老菲芘已经把收音机开了，正播送舞曲。她把声音开得很低，免得被女佣人听见。你真该看见她当时的样子。她直挺挺地坐在床中央，在被褥外面，象印度的修行僧那样盘着双腿。她正在欣赏音乐。我见了真把她爱煞。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"C'mon," I said. "You feel like dancing?" I taught her how to dance and all when she was a tiny little kid. She's a very good dancer. I mean I just taught her a few things. She learned it mostly by herself. You can't teach somebody how to really dance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“喂，”我说。“你想跳舞吗？”她还是个很小很小的毛孩子的时候，我就教会了她跳舞什么的。她是个了不起的舞蹈家。我是说我只教了她一些基本动作。她主要靠自学。舞要真正跳得好，光靠人教可不成。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You have shoes on," she said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你穿着鞋呢，”她说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'll take 'em off. C'mon."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我可以脱掉。来吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She practically jumped off the bed, and then she waited while I took my shoes off, and then I danced with her for a while. She's really damn good. I don't like people that dance with little kids, because most of the time it looks terrible. I mean if you're out at a restaurant somewhere and you see some old guy take his little kid out on the dance floor. Usually they keep yanking the kid's dress up in the back by mistake, and the kid can't dance worth a damn anyway, and it looks terrible, but I don't do it out in public with Phoebe or anything. We just horse around in the house. It's different with her anyway, because she can dance. She can follow anything you do. I mean if you hold her in close as hell so that it doesn't matter that your legs are so much longer. She stays right with you. You can cross over, or do some corny dips, or even jitterbug a little, and she stays right with you. You can even tango, for God's sake.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她简直是从床上跳下来的，然后她等着我把鞋子脱掉，我们就一起跳了会儿舞。她的舞跳得真是好极了。我不喜欢人们跟小孩子一块儿跳舞，因为十有九次那样子总是十分难看。我是说，在外面的餐厅里你总看见那么个老家伙带着自己的小孩子在舞池里跳舞。他们总是牛头不对马嘴，老攥住孩子背上的衣服一个劲儿往上拉，那孩子呢，简直他妈的不会跳舞，所以那样子真是难看极了，可我从来不带菲芘或别的孩子在公共场所跳舞。我们只是在家里跳着玩儿。不过话说回来，她毕竟与别的孩子不同，因为她会跳舞。不管你怎么跳她都跟得上。我是说位只要把她搂得紧紧的，那样一来不管你的腿比她长多少，也就不碍事了。她会紧跟着你。你可以转身，可以跳些粗俗的花步，甚至还可以跳会儿摇摆舞，她始终紧跟着你。你甚至还可以跳探戈呢，老天爷。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="我们跳了约莫四个曲子。在每个曲子的间歇时间，她的样子好笑得要命。她摆好了跳舞的姿势。她甚至连话都不说。你得跟她一起摆好姿势等乐队再一次开始演奏。我见了差点儿笑死。可你还不准笑哩。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“怎么进步的？”我说。我又挨着她在床上坐下了。我有点儿喘不过气来。我抽烟抽得他妈的太凶了，呼吸短得要命。她却连气都没喘一下。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then, all of a sudden, I started to cry. I couldn't help it. I did it so nobody could hear me, but I did it. It scared hell out of old Phoebe when I started doing it, and she came over and tried to make me stop, but once you get started, you can't just stop on a goddam dime. I was still sitting on the edge of the bed when I did it, and she put her old arm around my neck, and I put my arm around her, too, but I still couldn't stop for a long time. I thought I was going to choke to death or something. Boy, I scared hell out of poor old Phoebe. The damn window was open and everything, and I could feel her shivering and all, because all she had on was her pajamas. I tried to make her get back in bed, but she wouldn't go. Finally I stopped. But it certainly took me a long, long time. Then I finished buttoning my coat and all. I told her I'd keep in touch with her. She told me I could sleep with her if I wanted to, but I said no, that I'd better beat it, that Mr. Antolini was waiting for me and all. Then I took my hunting hat out of my coat pocket and gave it to her. She likes those kind of crazy hats. She didn't want to take it, but I made her. I'll bet she slept with it on. She really likes those kind of hats. Then I told her again I'd give her a buzz if I got a chance, and then I left.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一霎时，我哭了起来。我实在是情不自禁。我尽量不哭出声，可我的确哭了。我一哭，可把老菲芘吓坏了，她走过来想劝住我，可你只要一哭开，就没法看在区区一毛钱份上止住。我哭的时候仍坐在床沿上，她伸过一只胳膊来搂住我的脖子，我也伸出一只胳膊搂住她，可我依旧哭了好久，没法止住。我觉得自己哽咽得都快憋死了。嘿，我把可怜的老菲芘吓坏了。那扇混帐窗子正开着，我感觉得出她正在哆嗦，因为她身上只穿着一套睡衣裤。我想叫她回到床上去，可她不肯。最后我终于止住了。不过的的确确费了我很大很大工夫。接着我扣好大衣上的钮扣。我告诉她说我会跟她保持联系的。她对我说，要是我愿意的话，可以跟她一起睡，可我说不啦，我还是走的好，安多里尼先生正等着我哩。随后我从大衣袋里掏出我那顶猎人帽送给她。她喜爱这一类混帐帽子。她不肯接受，可我让她收下了。我敢打赌她准是戴着这顶帽子睡觉的。她的确喜爱这一类帽子。随后我又告诉她说，我一有机会就打电话给她，说完我就走了出来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I walked all the way downstairs, instead of taking the elevator. I went down the back stairs. I nearly broke my neck on about ten million garbage pails, but I got out all right. The elevator boy didn't even see me. He probably still thinks I'm up at the Dicksteins'.</div>
