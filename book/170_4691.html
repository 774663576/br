<div class="line_en">They sighted her in the narrows between the Isle of Cedars and the rugged hills of the Astapori hinterlands, just as the black priest Moqorro had said they would. "Ghiscari," Longwater Pyke shouted down from the crow's nest. Victarion Greyjoy watched her sail grow larger from the forecastle. Soon he could make out her oars rising and falling, and the long white wake behind her shining in the moonlight, like a scar across the sea.</div>

<div class="line_en">The captain of the galley had realized his peril by then. He changed course for the west, making for the Isle of Cedars, perhaps hoping to shelter in some hidden cove or run his pursuers onto the jagged rocks along the island's northeast coast. His galley was heavy laden, though, and the ironborn had the wind. Grief and Iron Victory cut across the quarry's course, whilst swift Sparrowhawk and agile Fingerdancer swept behind her. Even then the Ghiscari captain did not strike his banners. By the time Lamentation came alongside the prey, raking her larboard side and splintering her oars, both ships were so close to the haunted ruins of Ghozai that they could hear the monkeys chattering as the first dawn light washed over the city's broken pyramids.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到那时候，商船的船长意识到他的危险。他向西改变了航向，冲向雪松岛，也许希望躲进某个隐藏的小海湾，或沿着岛的东北岸驶向参差不齐的礁石逃离他的追捕者。不过他的商船令人担忧地载满了货物，并且铁种有风助阵。悲伤号和无敌铁种号抄近路切断猎物的航线，同时迅速的食雀鹰号和敏捷的手指舞号在她身后包抄。即使这样，吉斯的船长并没有降下他的旗帜。到那时悲叹号向猎物靠过来，擦着她的左侧舷，她的桨纷纷裂成碎片，两艘船都离闹鬼的苟再废墟这样近，以至于他们能听到猴子们喳喳的喧闹声，第一道曙光掠过这座城市破碎的金字塔。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Their prize was named Ghiscari Dawn, the galley's captain said when he was delivered to Victarion in chains. She was out of New Ghis and returning there by way of Yunkai after trading at Meereen. The man spoke no decent tongue but only a guttural Ghiscari, full of growls and hisses, as ugly a language as Victarion Greyjoy had ever heard. Moqorro translated the captain's words into the Common Tongue of Westeros. The war for Meereen was won, the captain claimed; the dragon queen was dead, and a Ghiscari by the name of Hizdak ruled the city now.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们的奖品被命名为吉斯之黎明号，商船的船长说，当他带着锁链被押到维克塔利昂面前。她自新吉斯离开，在弥林交易后途径渊凯正返回那里。这个人不会讲高雅的语言，只会一种刺耳的吉斯语，充满吼叫和嘶嘶声，像维克塔利昂·葛雷乔伊曾听过的一样难听的一种语言。莫阔罗将船长的话翻译成维斯特洛的通用语。弥林的战争赢了，船长声称：龙女王死了，一名叫赫尔扎克的吉斯人现在统治那座城市。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Victarion had his tongue torn out for lying. Daenerys Targaryen was not dead, Moqorro assured him; his red god R'hllor had shown him the queen's face in his sacred fires. The captain could not abide lies, so he had the Ghiscari captain bound hand and foot and thrown overboard, a sacrifice to the Drowned God. "Your red god will have his due," he promised Moqorro, "but the seas are ruled by the Drowned God."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因为撒谎，维克塔利昂拔掉了他的舌头。丹妮莉丝·坦格利安没有死，莫阔罗向他保证；他的红神拉赫洛在他的圣火中向他展示了女王的脸。船长不能容忍谎言，所以他下令将吉斯的船长捆上手脚，扔下船，一件献给淹神的祭品。“你的红神将得到他应得的，”他允诺莫阔罗，但大海是被淹神统治的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"There are no gods but R'hllor and the Other, whose name may not be said." The sorcerer priest was garbed in somber black, but for a hint of golden thread at collar, cuffs, and hem. There was no red cloth aboard the Iron Victory, but it was not meet that Moqorro go about in the salt-stained rags he had been wearing when the Vole fished him from the sea, so Victarion had commanded Tom Tidewood to sew new robes for him from whatever was at hand, and had even donated some of his own tunics to the purpose. Of black and gold those were, for the arms of House Greyjoy showed a golden kraken on a black field, and the banners and sails of their ships displayed the same. The crimson-and-scarlet robes of the red priests were alien to the ironborn, but Victarion had hoped his men might accept Moqorro more easily once clad in Greyjoy colors.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没有其他的神，只有拉赫洛和另一个其名字不可以说的。”巫师僧人身着暗黑色，但衣领、袖口、和下摆处有一点点金线。无敌铁种号上没有红色的布，但莫阔罗套着田鼠把他从海中捞上来时曾穿的那身盐渍的破布条走来走去并不合适，所以维克塔利昂吩咐漂木汤姆为他缝几件全新的长袍，用手头的无论什么布料，甚至为此赠送了他自己的一些外衣。它们是黑色和金色的，葛雷乔伊家族的徽章描绘着黑色的底子上一只金色的海怪，他们船上的旗帜和帆展开相同的。对于铁种来说，穿深红色和鲜红色长袍的红袍僧是格格不入的，但维克塔利昂希望他的手下可能会更容易接受莫阔罗，一旦他穿上葛雷乔伊的颜色。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He hoped in vain. Clad in black from head to heel, with a mask of red-and-orange flames tattooed across his face, the priest appeared more sinister than ever. The crew shunned him when he walked the deck, and men would spit if his shadow chanced to fall upon them. Even the Vole, who had fished the red priest from the sea, had urged Victarion to give him to the Drowned God.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的期望落空了。从头到脚身着黑色，一个红色和橙黄色的火焰纹面具横在他的脸上，僧人似乎比以前更邪恶了。当他走在甲板上，船员回避他，如果他的影子碰巧落在他们身上，人们会吐口水。甚至田鼠，这个把红袍僧从海里捞上来的人，力劝维克塔利昂将他献给淹神。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But Moqorro knew these strange shores in ways the ironborn did not, and secrets of the dragonkind as well. The Crow's Eye keeps wizards, why shouldn't I? His black sorcerer was more puissant than all of Euron's three, even if you threw them in a pot and boiled them down to one. The Damphair might disapprove, but Aeron and his pieties were far away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但莫阔罗有手段了解这些陌生的海岸，铁种则没有，还有龙类的秘密。鸦眼雇用巫师们，我为什么不能？他的黑巫师比攸伦的三个都要强大，纵然你把他们扔进锅里煮了倒出一个来。湿发可能不赞成，但伊伦和他的虔诚远在天边。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So Victarion closed his burned hand into a mighty fist, and said, "Ghiscari Dawn is no fit name for a ship of the Iron Fleet.

<div class="line_en">"The black priest is calling demons down on us," one oarsman was heard to say. When that was reported to Victarion, he had the man scourged until his back was blood from shoulders to buttocks. So when Moqorro said, "Your lost lambs will return to the flock off the isle called Yaros," the captain said, "Pray that they do, priest. Or you may be the next to taste the whip."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“黑僧人召唤恶魔降祸于我们，”一位桨手被人听到他这么说。当这件事被报告给维克塔利昂时，他下令鞭打这个人，直到他的背部从肩膀到臀部都是血。所以当莫阔罗说，“在那个名为雅洛斯的小岛的沿海，你迷失的羔羊会返回羊群。”船长说，“祈祷他们如此，僧人。否则你可能是下一个尝鞭子的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The next day a sudden squall descended on them. Moqorro had predicted that as well. When the rains moved on, three ships were found to have vanished. Victarion had no way to know whether they had foundered, run aground, or been blown off course. "They know where we are going," he told his crew. "If they are still afloat, we will meet again." The iron captain had no time to wait for laggards. Not with his bride encircled by her enemies. The most beautiful woman in the world has urgent need of my axe.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天一场突然的风暴袭击了他们。莫阔罗也曾预测到这个。当这场雨离开后，三艘船被发现不见了。维克塔利昂没办法知道他们是否搁浅了，沉没了，或被吹离了航线。“他们知道我们要去哪儿，”他告诉他的船员。“如果他们还浮在水面上，我们将再次相遇。”铁船长没有时间等待落后者。不行，与此同时他的新娘被她的敌人们包围。世界上最美丽的女人迫切需要我的斧头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Besides, Moqorro assured him that the three ships were not lost. Each night, the sorcerer priest would kindle a fire on the forecastle of the Iron Victory and stalk around the flames, chanting prayers. The firelight made his black skin shine like polished onyx, and sometimes Victarion could swear that the flames tattooed on his face were dancing too, twisting and bending, melting into one another, their colors changing with every turn of the priest's head.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此外，莫阔罗向他保证，三艘船都没有丢。每一个夜晚，巫师僧人会在无敌铁种号的甲板上点燃一堆火，大踏步绕着火焰走，咏唱着经文。火光使他黑色的皮肤光泽像抛光的玛瑙，有时维克塔利昂可以发誓他脸上的火焰纹身也在跳舞，缠绕着、弯曲着，融为一体，它们的颜色随着僧人脑袋的每一次转动而改变着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This time it was a Myrish cog named Dove, on her way to Yunkai by way of New Ghis with a cargo of carpets, sweet green wines, and Myrish lace. Her captain owned a Myrish eye that made far-off things look close -- two glass lenses in a series of brass tubes, cunningly wrought so that each section slid into the next, until the eye was no longer than a dirk. Victarion claimed that treasure for himself. The cog he renamed Shrike. Her crew would be kept for ransom, the captain decreed. They were neither slaves nor slavers, but free Myrmen and seasoned sailors. Such men were worth good coin. Sailing out of Myr, the Dove brought them no fresh news of Meereen or Daenerys, only stale reports of Dothraki horsemen along the Rhoyne, the Golden Company upon the march, and others things Victarion already knew.</div>

<div class="line_en">And so it came to pass. This time the prey proved to be a pair of galleys, long and sleek and fast. Ralf the Limper was the first to sight them, but they soon outdistanced Woe and Forlorn Hope, so Victarion sent Iron Wing, Sparrowhawk, and Kraken's Kiss to run them down. He had no swifter ships than those three. The pursuit lasted the best part of the day, but in the end both galleys were boarded and taken, after brief but brutal fights. They had been running empty, Victarion learned, making for New Ghis to load supplies and weapons for the Ghiscari legions encamped before Meereen… and to bring fresh legionaries to the war, to replace all the men who'd died. "Men slain in battle?" asked Victarion. The crews of the galleys denied it; the deaths were from a bloody flux. The pale mare, they called it. And like the captain of the Ghiscari Dawn, the captains of the galleys repeated the lie that Daenerys Targaryen was dead.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="事情就这样发生了。这次的猎物被证实是一对战船，修长、线条流畅、速度快。瘸子拉尔夫第一个发现她们，但她们很快就超过了悲哀号和敢死队号，因此维克塔利昂派铁翼号，食雀鹰号，和海妖之吻号追捕她们。他没有比这三艘船更快的船了。追击持续了一天中最精彩的部分，但到最后两艘战船都被登上并劫获，经过了短暂但残酷的战斗之后。她们空舱行驶，维克塔利昂获悉，前往新吉斯，为在弥林前扎营的吉斯军团装补给…并带新的军团来作战，以代替所有已经死去的士兵。“在战斗中被杀死的人？”维克塔利昂问。战船的船员否定：死亡源于一种该死的传染病。他们称之为‘苍白母马’。像吉斯之黎明号的船长一样，战船的两名船长重复了那个谎言：丹妮莉丝·坦格利安死了。">查看中文翻译</div>

He wondered if this was how his brother Aeron felt when the Drowned God spoke to him. He could almost hear the god's voice welling up from the depths of the sea.

Their holds were packed with trade goods, wines and silks and spices, rare woods and rarer scents, but the ships themselves were the true prize. Later that same day, a fishing ketch was taken by Seven Skulls and Thrall's Bane. She was a small, slow, dingy thing, hardly worth the effort of boarding. Victarion was displeased to hear that it had taken two of his own ships to bring the fishermen to heel. Yet it was from their lips that he heard of the black dragon's return.

<div class="line_en">"Your Drowned God is a demon," the black priest Moqorro said afterward. "He is no more than a thrall of the Other, the dark god whose name must not be spoken."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Take care, priest," Victarion warned him. "There are godly men aboard this ship who would tear out your tongue for speaking such blasphemies. Your red god will have his due, I swear it. My word is iron. Ask any of my men."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“当心，僧人，”维克塔利昂警告他。“讲这样亵渎神明的话，在这艘船上敬虔的人会撕下你的舌头。你的红神将得到他应得的，我发誓。我的话是铁。问我任何一名手下。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He should not have said that. Victarion took him around the throat with his burned hand and lifted him bodily into the air. Slamming him back against the mast, he squeezed till the Yunkishman's face turned as black as the fingers digging into his flesh. The man kicked and writhed for a while, trying fruitlessly to pry loose the captain's grip. "No man calls Victarion Greyjoy a fool and lives to boast of it." When he opened his hand, the man's limp body flopped to the deck. Longwater Pyke and Tom Tidewood chucked it over the rail, another offering to the Drowned God.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他不该这样说。维克塔利昂用烧伤的手掐住他的喉咙，把他的身体提在半空中。将他的后背砰的一声撞在桅杆上，他使劲掐，直到这名渊凯人的脸色变得像挖进他肉里的手指那样黑。这个男人踢腿扭动了一阵子，徒劳地试图撬松船长紧握的手。“没人叫维克塔利昂·葛雷乔伊傻瓜还有命去炫耀。”当他松开他的手，这人毫无生气的身体瘫倒在甲板上。长水派克和漂木汤姆将尸体越过栏杆扔了下去，又一个献给淹神的祭品。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Strange sails grew more common north of Yaros. They were very near to Yunkai, and the coast between the Yellow City and Meereen would be teeming with merchantmen and supply ships coming and going, so Victarion took the Iron Fleet out into the deeper waters, beyond the sight of land. Even there they would encounter other vessels. "Let none escape to give warning to our foes," the iron captain commanded. None did.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="雅洛斯岛以北，陌生的帆变得更常见。他们非常接近渊凯，这座黄色城市与弥林之间的海岸，将会充满着来来往往的商船和补给船，所以维克塔利昂让铁舰队进入更深的海域，看不到陆地。即使在那里他们也会遇到其它船只。“不许放跑一个去警告我们的敌人，“铁船长命令。一个也逃不掉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Those words pleased Victarion Greyjoy mightily, as he told the dusky woman that night. "My brother Balon was a great man," he said, "but I shall do what he could not. The Iron Islands shall be free again, and the Old Way will return. Even Dagon could not do that." Almost a hundred years had passed since Dagon Greyjoy sat the Seastone Chair, but the ironborn still told tales of his raids and battles. In Dagon's day a weak king sat the Iron Throne, his rheumy eyes fixed across the narrow sea where bastards and exiles plotted rebellion. So forth from Pyke Lord Dagon sailed, to make the Sunset Sea his own. "He bearded the lion in his den and tied the direwolf's tail in knots, but even Dagon could not defeat the dragons. But I shall make the dragon queen mine own. She will share my bed and bear me many mighty sons."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这些话令维克塔利昂·葛雷乔伊非常高兴，正如那天晚上他告诉黑女人。“我哥哥巴隆是一位伟大的人，”他说，“但我将要做他不能做的。铁群岛将重获自由，古道将恢复。甚至戴贡都做不到这个。”差不多已经过去了一百年，自从戴贡？葛雷乔伊坐在海石椅上，但铁种仍在讲述他劫掠和战斗的故事。在戴贡的时代，一位软弱的国王坐在铁王座上，他潮湿的双眼盯向狭海对面，在那里杂种们和流亡者们策划了叛乱。因此戴贡大人从派克岛向外航行，去让日落之海成为他自己的。“他能深入狮穴扯狮子的胡须，将冰原狼们的尾巴打成蝴蝶结，但是，甚至戴贡也不能战胜龙。但我要使龙女王成为我自己的。她会分享我的床，为我生许多强有力的儿子。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For himself, Victarion claimed the seven choicest girls. One had red-gold hair and freckles on her teats. One shaved herself all over. One was brown-haired and brown-eyed, shy as a mouse. One had the biggest breasts he had ever seen. The fifth was a little thing, with straight black hair and golden skin. Her eyes were the color of amber. The sixth was white as milk, with golden rings through her nipples and her nether lips, the seventh black as a squid's ink. The slavers of Yunkai had trained them in the way of the seven sighs, but that was not why Victarion wanted them. His dusky woman was enough to satisfy his appetites until he could reach Meereen and claim his queen. No man had need of candles when the sun awaited him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="为自己，维克塔利昂索取了七位最好的女孩。一个是金红色的头发，乳头上有几点雀斑。一个浑身剃光。一个是棕色头发、棕色眼睛，胆怯的像只老鼠。一个有他曾见过的最大的乳房。第五个是一个小东西，有直的黑发和金色的皮肤。她的眼睛是琥珀的颜色。第六个白的像牛奶，几个黄金吊环穿在她的乳头和下嘴唇上，第七个黑如乌贼墨。渊凯的奴隶贩子训练她们关于七种叹息的方法，但这不是维克塔利昂要她们的原因。他的黑女人足够满足他的欲望，直到他能到达弥林并赢得他的女王。没有人需要蜡烛，当太阳在等待着他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Victarion put the slavers to the sword, then sent his men below to un-chain the rowers. "You row for me now. Row hard, and you shall prosper." The girls he divided amongst his captains. "The Lyseni would have made whores of you," he told them, "but we have saved you. Now you need only serve one man instead of many. Those who please their captains may be taken as salt wives, an honorable station." The perfumed boys he wrapped in chains and threw into the sea. They were unnatural creatures, and the ship smelled better once cleansed of their presence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="维克塔利昂杀死了那些奴隶贩子，然后派人到下面去解开桨手们的铁链。“你们现在为我划船。努力划，你们必须成功做到。”女孩被他分给了他的船长们。“里斯人会让你们当鸡女，”他说，“但我们拯救了你们。现在你们只需伺候一个男人而不是许多。那些取悦于她们的船长的可能被收作盐妻，一个体面的身份。”芬芳的男孩被他绕上铁链抛进了大海。他们是反常的生物，一旦清理掉他们，船就闻起来更佳。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The sea was green and the sky was grey the morning Grief and Warrior Wench and Victarion's own Iron Victory captured the slaver galley from Yunkai in the waters due north of the Yellow City. In her holds were twenty perfumed boys and four score girls destined for the pleasure houses of Lys. Her crew never thought to find peril so close to their home waters, and the ironborn had little trouble taking her. She was named the Willing Maiden.</div>

<div class="line_en">The galley he renamed the Slaver's Scream. With her, the ships of the Iron Fleet numbered one-and-sixty. "Every ship we capture makes us stronger," Victarion told his ironborn, "but from here it will grow harder. On the morrow or the day after, we are like to meet with warships. We are entering the home waters of Meereen, where the fleets of our foes await us. We will meet with ships from all three Slaver Cities, ships from Tolos and Elyria and New Ghis, even ships from Qarth." He took care not to mention the green galleys of Old Volantis that surely must be sailing up through the Gulf of Grief even as he spoke. "These slavers are feeble things. You have seen how they run before us, heard how they squeal when we put them to the sword. Every man of you is worth twenty of them, for only we are made of iron. Remember this when first we next spy some slaver's sails. Give no quarter and expect none. What need have we of quarter? We are the ironborn, and two gods look over us. We will seize their ships, smash their hopes, and turn their bay to blood."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="运奴船他改名为奴隶之尖叫号。算上她，铁舰队的船数达到了六十一艘。“我们捕获的每一艘船都使我们更强大，”维克塔利昂告诉他的铁种，“但打这儿起，要时刻准备战斗。在明天或后天，我们可能遭遇到战船。我们正在进入弥林的领海，敌人的舰队正在那里等待着我们。我们将碰到来自全部三个奴隶城市的船，来自托罗斯、埃利亚、新吉斯的船，甚至来自从魁尔斯的船。”他小心不提起旧瓦兰提斯的绿色战船，想必一定正向北航行通过悲痛海湾，正当他讲话的时候。“那些奴隶主是软弱的东西。你们见到过在我们面前他们是如何逃跑的，当我们杀死他们的时候，听到他们是如何长声尖叫的。你们每个人都顶他们二十个人，只因我们是铁做的。记住这个，当我们随后首先发现某个奴隶贩子的帆。不接受投降，不给他们希望。我们要仁慈干什么？我们是铁种，两位神灵眷顾着我们。我们将俘获他们的船，粉碎他们的希望，把他们的海湾变成一片血海。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"With this gift of innocence and beauty, we honor both the gods," he proclaimed, as the warships of the Iron Fleet rowed past the burning ketch. "Let these girls be reborn in light, undefiled by mortal lust, or let them descend to the Drowned God's watery halls, to feast and dance and laugh until the seas dry up."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“献上这个纯真美丽的礼物，我们尊敬的两位神，”他宣告，当铁舰队的战船划船从熊熊燃烧的渔船旁边经过。“让这些女孩从火焰中重生，纯洁无暇摆脱凡人的欲望，或让她们降到淹神的水底圣殿，享用美食、跳舞、欢笑直到大海枯竭。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A great cry went up at his words. The captain answered with a nod, grim-faced, then called for the seven girls he had claimed to be brought on deck, the loveliest of all those found aboard the Willing Maiden. He kissed them each upon the cheeks and told them of the honor that awaited them, though they did not understand his words. Then he had them put aboard the fishing ketch that they had captured, cut her loose, and had her set afire.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一阵巨大的欢呼响应他的话。船长点头回应，表情严肃，然后要求带他索取的七名女孩到甲板上来，在甘心少女号上发现的所有那些女孩中最可爱的。他吻了她们每个人的脸颊，告诉她们荣耀在等待着她们，尽管她们不懂他的话。然后他将她们送上曾抓获的那条捕鱼船，割断她的缆绳，朝她放火。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Near the end, before the smoking ketch was swallowed by the sea, the cries of the seven sweetlings changed to joyous song, it seemed to Victarion Greyjoy. A great wind came up then, a wind that filled their sails and swept them north and east and north again, toward Meereen and its pyramids of many-colored bricks. On wings of song I fly to you, Daenerys, the iron captain thought.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Once." One of his brother's mongrels had sounded the hellhorn at the kingsmoot on Old Wyk. A monster of a man he had been, huge and shaven-headed, with rings of gold and jet and jade around arms thick with muscle, and a great hawk tattooed across his chest. "The sound it made… it burned, somehow. As if my bones were on fire, searing my flesh from within. Those writings glowed red-hot, then white-hot and painful to look upon. It seemed as if the sound would never end. It was like some long scream. A thousand screams, all melted into one."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“一次。”在老威克岛的选王会上，他哥哥的混血儿中的一位曾吹响了地狱号角。他曾是一头怪兽，巨大的光头，戴着黄金和黑玉的戒指、绿玉环绕着隆起肌肉的两条粗胳膊，一只巨鹰纹身横在他的胸前。“它发出的声音…它能燃烧，不知为什么。仿佛我的骨头着了火，从里面烧焦我的肉。这些文字变成炽热的红色，然后热得发白，难以直视。看起来好像这个声音将永远也不会结束。它就像某种长长的尖叫。一千个尖叫，都汇成一片。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That night, for the first time, he brought forth the dragon horn that the Crow's Eye had found amongst the smoking wastes of great Valyria. A twisted thing it was, six feet long from end to end, gleaming black and banded with red gold and dark Valyrian steel. Euron's hellhorn. Victarion ran his hand along it. The horn was as warm and smooth as the dusky woman's thighs, and so shiny that he could see a twisted likeness of his own features in its depths. Strange sorcerous writings had been cut into the bands that girded it. "Valyrian glyphs," Moqorro called them.</div>
