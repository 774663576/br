<meta content="他的眼睛比正常位置低了一英寸，几乎掉到了脸中间。它们向下倾斜得厉害，好像有人在他脸上呈对角线砍了一刀，左眼明显比右眼低多了。它们还向外凸出，因为他的眼窝太浅，容纳不下眼珠。他的上眼皮总是耷拉着，好像快要睡着了。下眼皮则下垂得厉害，看起来好像被一根无形的线向下拉着，你可以看到眼睑里面红色的血肉，好像从里面翻了出来。他没有眉毛和睫毛，相对他的脸来说，他的鼻子大得不成比例，像块赘肉。他的头部在耳朵的位置瘪了进去，像是有人用大钳子把他的脸从中间夹了一下。他也没有颧骨。从鼻翼两侧到嘴巴两侧，有两道深深的皱纹纵贯而下，这让他的容貌有一种蜡状感。有时候人们会认为他是被烧伤的，因为他的容貌看起来好像融化了，形同垂泪的蜡烛。一系列矫正上颚的手术在他嘴巴四周留下了好几个疤痕，最醒目的是一条锯齿状的切口，从他的上嘴唇中央一直延伸到鼻子。他的上牙很小，并呈八字形斜开。他有很严重的龅牙，还有一副尺寸过小的颚骨，下巴也小得可怜。在他很小的时候，如果不是动手术把他的腿骨移植到了下颚，他根本就没有下巴。如果没有下巴，他的舌头就会从嘴里掉出来。谢天谢地，现在他已经好多了。至少，他已经可以吃东西了——他小的时候，只能靠导管喂食。他也能说话了，已经学会了把舌头放在嘴里——不过他花了好几年时间才掌握这门技巧。他也学会了如何控制住，不让口水滴到脖子上。这些都被看作奇迹。当他还是个小婴儿的时候，医生认为他根本存活不了。" name="description"/>

<div class="line_en">His eyes are about an inch below where they should be on his face, almost to halfway down his cheeks. They slant downward at an extreme angle, almost like diagonal slits that someone cut into his face, and the left one is noticeably lower than the right one. They bulge outward because his eye cavities are too shallow to accommodate them. The top eyelids are always halfway closed, like he's on the verge of sleeping. The lower eyelids sag so much they almost look like a piece of invisible string is pulling them downward: you can see the red part on the inside, like they're almost inside out. He doesn't have eyebrows or eyelashes. His nose is disproportionately big for his face, and kind of fleshy. His head is pinched in on the sides where the ears should be, like someone used giant pliers and crushed the middle part of his face. He doesn't have cheekbones. There are deep creases running down both sides of his nose to his mouth, which gives him a waxy appearance. Sometimes people assume he's been burned in a fire: his features look like they've been melted, like the drippings on the side of a candle. Several surgeries to correct his palate have left a few scars around his mouth, the most noticeable one being a jagged gash running from the middle of his upper lip to his nose. His upper teeth are small and splay out. He has a severe overbite and an extremely undersized jawbone. He has a very small chin. When he was very little, before a piece of his hip bone was surgically implanted into his lower jaw, he really had no chin at all. His tongue would just hang out of his mouth with nothing underneath to block it. Thankfully, it's better now. He can eat, at least: when he was younger, he had a feeding tube. And he can talk. And he's learned to keep his tongue inside his mouth, though that took him several years to master. He's also learned to control the drool that used to run down his neck. These are considered miracles. When he was a baby, the doctors didn't think he'd live.</div>

<div class="line_en">He can hear, too. Most kids born with these types of birth defects have problems with their middle ears that prevent them from hearing, but so far August can hear well enough through his tiny cauliflower-shaped ears. The doctors think that eventually he'll need to wear hearing aids, though. August hates the thought of this. He thinks the hearing aids will get noticed too much. I don't tell him that the hearing aids would be the least of his problems, of course, because I'm sure he knows this.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他也听得见了。大部分先天畸形孩子的中耳都会有问题，以致听力受损，但是到目前为止，奥古斯特那花椰菜般的小小耳朵的听力还算不错。不过，医生认为他最终要使用助听器才行。奥古斯特讨厌这样的可能。他觉得助听器太惹人注意了。我当然没有跟他说，助听器只是他所有问题中最小的一个，因为我可以肯定他知道这一点。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Does August see how other people see him, or has he gotten so good at pretending not to see that it doesn't bother him? Or does it bother him? When he looks in the mirror, does he see the Auggie Mom and Dad see, or does he see the Auggie everyone else sees? Or is there another August he sees, someone in his dreams behind the misshapen head and face? Sometimes when I looked at Grans, I could see the pretty girl she used to be underneath the wrinkles. I could see the girl from Ipanema inside the old-lady walk. Does August see himself as he might have looked without that single gene that caused the catastrophe of his face?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="奥古斯特看得见别人怎么看他吗？或者他已经修炼到视而不见，不受干扰了？还是这一切都困扰着他？当他照镜子的时候，他看到的是妈妈和爸爸眼中的奥吉，还是别人眼中的奥吉？或者，他看到的是另一个奥古斯特，一个在他梦境里的隐藏在畸形头脸背后的人？有时候我看着外婆，我能在深深皱纹下看到那个曾经的漂亮女孩，我也能从步履蹒跚中看到那个来自依帕内玛的女孩。难道奥古斯特能看到自己的脸没有被单基因毁坏掉的样子？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I wish I could ask him this stuff. I wish he would tell me how he feels. He used to be easier to read before the surgeries. You knew that when his eyes squinted, he was happy. When his mouth went straight, he was being mischievous. When his cheeks trembled, he was about to cry. He looks better now, no doubt about that, but the signs we used to gauge his moods are all gone. There are new ones, of course. Mom and Dad can read every single one. But I'm having trouble keeping up. And there's a part of me that doesn't want to keep trying: why can't he just say what he's feeling like everyone else? He doesn't have a trache tube in his mouth anymore that keeps him from talking. His jaw's not wired shut. He's ten years old. He can use his words. But we circle around him like he's still the baby he used to be. We change plans, go to plan B, interrupt conversations, go back on promises depending on his moods, his whims, his needs. That was fine when he was little. But he needs to grow up now. We need to let him, help him, make him grow up. Here's what I think: we've all spent so much time trying to make August think he's normal that he actually thinks he is normal. And the problem is, he's not.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我希望能问他这些问题。我希望他能告诉我他的感受。动手术前，还比较容易看懂他。你知道他眯眼，说明他很高兴。他撇嘴，说明他正在调皮。他下巴颤抖，说明他想哭。毫无疑问，他现在好多了，但是我们过去识别他情绪的信号也消失了。当然，又有了新的信号。妈妈和爸爸对此了如指掌。但我却很难跟得上了。我也不想尝试了：为什么他不能像其他所有人那样说出他的感受？他嘴里已经不再含着阻碍他说话的导管了。他的下巴也没有被缝起来。他已经十岁了。他可以组织自己的语言了。但是我们依然围着他团团转，好像他依然是个还没长大的婴儿。我们根据他的心情、他的心血来潮和他的需要改变计划、采取备用方案、中断谈话、出尔反尔等等。如果他还小，这样做没关系。但是现在他需要长大。我们需要允许他、帮助他、促使他长大。我真正想说的是：我们已经花了那么长时间努力让奥古斯特觉得他是普通人，他也真的觉得自己是。但问题是，他不是。">查看中文翻译</div>
