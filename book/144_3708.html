<div class="line_en">Loddstone studios was the most powerful movie-making entity in Hollywood, but Athena Aquitane's refusal to go back to work was a costly treachery.

Six of the rooms were devoted to his large collection of paintings.</div>

<div class="line_en">Eli Marrion dominated this gathering. His body was eighty years old but so cleverly disguised you took it for no more than sixty. His gray hair was perfectly cut and tinted to silver, his dark suit broadened his shoulders, added flesh to his bones, insulated his pipe-thin shanks. Mahogany shoes anchored him to earth. A white shirt was vertically cut with a rose-colored tie that pinked his grayish pallor. But his rule over LoddStone Studios was absolute only when he wanted it to be. There were times when it was more prudent to let mere mortals exercise their free will.</div>

<div class="line_en">But writers? All they had to do was make that initial tracing on blank white paper. You hired another dozen to work it over. Then the producer shaped the plot. The director invented Business (sometimes a whole new picture), and then the stars came up with inspired bits of dialogue. Then there was the Creative Staff of the Studio who, in long, carefully thought out memos, gave writers insights, plot ideas, and wish lists. Bantz had seen many a million-dollar script from a big-shot screenwriter paid a million dollars, only to find when the picture was finished it contained not a single plot incident or word of dialogue of the writer's. Sure, Eli had a soft spot for writers, but that was because they were so easy to screw on their contracts.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那么，编剧们呢？需要他们做的，不过是在几张白纸上开个头。然后你还得再另雇十几个人完成。制片人敲定情节，导演开始拍（有时候拍出来的是完全不同的电影），影星们用点点滴滴的灵感即兴编几句对白。接下来，电影公司的创意人员对照着又长又细致的备忘录，给写手提意见和要求，提供情节。邦茨见过好多次，某个著名编剧写出来的剧本号称价值百万，也拿到了百万美元的酬劳，结果等到电影最后拍出来，连一个情节、一句对白都没用上。伊莱对待编剧的态度当然会软一些——不过是因为他们在签合同的时候好欺负罢了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Bantz refused to give even the standard lip service to writers. It was true you needed a script to start, but Bantz believed that you lived and died by casting. Star power. Directors were important because they could steal you blind. Producers, no slouches when it came to thievery, were necessary for the manic energy that started a movie.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对于编剧，邦茨连空头许诺都不愿意给。没错，要想开拍，得先有剧本，但邦茨相信，作品成败靠的是演员阵容、明星的力量。导演之所以重要，是因为他们会在不知不觉中掏空你的钱。制片人虽然也十分乐于坑钱，但要启动一部电影，少不了他们那种旺盛精力。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was Bantz who took over from movie directors after their artistic cut and made their films acceptable to audiences.

It was Bantz who negotiated very tough contracts with Talent. Especially writers.</div>

There was no doubt about it, people who pursued money rather than art had longer careers, got more pleasure in life, were much better and more socially valuable people than those artists who tried to show the divine spark in human beings.

<div class="line_en">Bobby Bantz had gathered them all up from the festival going on outside the mansion. The only Talent there was the director of Messalina, a woman named Dita Tommey, in the A class and known as the best with female stars, which in Hollywood today meant not homosexual but feminist. The fact that she was also a lesbian was irrelevant to all these men in the conference room. Dita Tommey brought in her pictures under budget, her pictures made money, and her liaisons with females caused far less trouble on a picture than a male director screwing his actresses did. Lesbian lovers of the famous were docile.</div>

<div class="line_en">Messalina told the story of the Roman Empire under the Emperor Claudius from a feminist point of view. History, written by males, painted the Empress Messalina as a corrupt and murderous harlot, who one night took on the whole population of Rome in sexual debauch. But in the movie creating her life almost two thousand years later, she was revealed as a tragic heroine, an Antigone, another Medea. A woman who, using the only weapons available to her, tried to change a world in which men were so dominant that they treated the female sex, half the human race, as if they were slaves.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a great concept -- rampant sex acts in full color and a highly relevant and popular theme -- but it needed a perfect package to make the whole thing credible. First Claudia De Lena wrote a script that was witty and had a strong story line. Dita Tommey as director was a pragmatic and politically correct choice. She had a dry intelligence and was a proven director. Athena Aquitane was perfect as Messalina and had completely dominated the picture so far. She had the beauty of face and body, and the genius of her acting made everything plausible. More important, she was one of the three female Bankable Stars in the world. Claudia, with her own offbeat genius, had even given her a scene in which Messalina, seduced by the growing Christian legends, saved martyrs from the sure death of the amphitheater. When Tommey read the scene she said to Claudia, "Hey, there's a limit."</div>

Curiously enough, he was wearing a tie, shirt, and jacket, perhaps to show that after all he was still a banker.

<div class="line_en">Pollard looked at the man with curiosity. The guy was handsome as the rugged Marlboro man in the cigarette ads, except that his skin was red with sun and booze and his body build was bulkier. He had that charming drawl of the South, which was both humorous and dangerous. A lot of women fell in love with such men. In New York there had been some cops with the same kind of looks, and they had scored like bandits. You sent them out on murder cases and in a week they were consoling the widows. Jim Losey was a cop like that, come to think of it. Pollard had never been so lucky.</div>
