<div class="line_en">"We are standing at the Acropolis. The word means 'citadel'-- or more precisely, 'the city on the hill.' People have lived up here since the Stone Age. The reason, naturally, was its unique location. The elevated plateau was easy to defend against marauders. From the Acrop-olis there was also an excellent view down to one of the best harbors in the Mediterranean. As the early Athens began to develop on the plain below the plateau, the Acropolis was used as a fortress and sacred shrine… During the first half of the fifth century B. C., a bitter war was waged against the Persians, and in 480 the Persian king Xerxes plundered Athens and burned all the old wooden buildings of the Acropolis. A year later the Persians were defeated, and that was the beginning of the Golden Age of Athens. The Acropolis was rebuilt -- prouder and more magnificent than ever -- and now purely as a sacred shrine.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们现在正站在雅典的高城（Acropolis）。这个字的意思是‘城堡’，或者更准确地说，是‘山城’的意思。自从石器时代以来，这里就有人居住。这自然是因为它地理位置特殊的缘故。它的地势高，在盗匪入侵时容易防守。从高城这儿俯瞰，可以很清楚地看到地中海的一个良港。古代雅典人开始在高地下面的平原发展时，高城被当作城堡和神庙。公元前第四世纪的前半，雅典人对波斯人发动了一场惨烈的战争。公元前48O年时，波斯国王齐尔克西（Xerxes）率兵掠夺了雅典城，并将高城所有的古老木造建筑焚烧净尽。一年后，波斯人被打败，雅典的黄金时代也从此开始。雅典人开始重建高城，规模更大，气象也更雄浑，而且完全做为神庙使用。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"This was the period when Socrates walked through the streets and squares talking with the Athenians. He could thus have witnessed the rebirth of the Acropolis and watched the construction of all the proud buildings we see around us. And what a building site it was! Behind me you can see the biggest temple, the Parthenon, which means 'the Virgin's Place.' It was built in honor of Athene, the patron goddess of Athens. The huge marble structure does not have a single straight line; all four sides are slightly curved to make the building appear less heavy. In spite of its colossal dimensions, it gives the impression of lightness. In other words, it presents an optical illusion. The columns lean slightly inwards, and would form a pyramid 1,500 meters high if they were continued to a point above the temple. The temple contained nothing but a twelve-meter-high statue of Athene. The white marble, which in those days was painted in vivid colors, was transported here from a mountain sixteen kilometers away."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“就在这个时期，苏格拉底穿梭在大街小巷与广场上，与雅典人民谈话。他原本可以目睹高城的复兴，并看到我们四周这些雄伟建筑的进展。你瞧，这是一个多么好的地方。在我后面，你可以看到世界上最大的神庙巴特农神殿。巴特农（Parthenon）的意思是‘处女之地’，是为了崇奉雅典的保护神雅典娜（Athene）而建造的。这整座宏伟的大理石建筑看不到一条直线。它的四面墙壁都稍微有些弧度，以使整栋建筑看来不致太过沉重。也因此这座神庙虽然硕大无朋，却仍给人轻巧之感，这就是所谓的视觉幻象。神殿所有的柱子都微向内弯，如果继续朝上发展，将可以形成一座一千五百公尺高的金字塔。神殿内只有一尊十二公尺高的雅典娜雕像。此处所用的白色大理石是从十六公里以外的一座山上运来的，当年上面还有五彩的图画。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"There you can see the old Dionysos Theater," continued the man in the beret. "It is probably the very oldest theater in Europe. This is where the great tragedies of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides were performed during the time of Socrates. I referred earlier to the ill-fated King Oedipus. The tragedy about him, by Sophocles, was first performed here. But they also played comedies. The best known writer of comedies was Aristophanes, who also wrote a spiteful comedy about Socrates as the buffoon of Athens. Right at the back you can see the stone wall which the actors used as a backdrop. It was called skene, and is the origin of our word 'scene.' Incidentally, the word 'theater' comes from an old Greek word meaning 'to see.' But we must get back to the philosophers, Sophie. We are going around the Parthenon and down through the gateway…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你在那里可以看到古老的酒神剧院。”这位戴着扁帽的老人继续说：“这也许是欧洲最古老的剧院。在苏格拉底时期，伊思齐勒斯（Aeschylus）、索福克里斯（Sophocles）与尤瑞皮底斯（Euripides）等希腊剧作家写的伟大悲剧就在这儿上演。我以前曾经提到命运凄惨的伊迪帕斯国王。这出悲剧最先就是在这儿上演。不过这里也演喜剧。当时最知名的喜剧作家叫亚里斯多芬尼斯（Aristophanes）。他曾经写过一出恶毒的喜剧，将苏格拉底描写成雅典的一个丑角。在剧院正后方，你可以看到一块当年被演员们用作背景的地方，叫做skene，英文的scene（场景）这个字就是由此字衍生的。顺便一提的是，英文theater（剧院、剧场）这个字是源自古希腊文，原意是“看”。不过，到这里，我们得回头谈谈哲学家了。现在我们要绕过巴特农神殿走下去，经过大门口…”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The next moment he appeared among the ancient ruins. High up beneath the sky -- at the top of Sophie's screen -- towered the monumental Athene temple on the Acropolis. Her philosophy teacher had seated himself on one of the blocks of marble. He looked into the camera and said: "We are sitting in the old agora in Athens. A sorry sight, don't you think? Today, I mean. But once it was surrounded by splendid temples, courts of justice and other public offices, shops, a concert hall, and even a large gymnastics building. All situated around the square, which was a large open space… The whole of European civilization was founded in this modest area.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不久，他出现在这片古废墟中。在荧屏上方，只见高城的雅典娜神殿巍然矗立在天空下。她的哲学教师已经坐在一块大理石上。一两分钟后，他看着摄影机说：“现在我们正坐在从前雅典的市区广场上。如今这里的景象令人唏嘘，不是吗？但从前这里四周环绕的都是壮丽的神殿、法院和其他政府机构、商店、音乐厅，甚至还有一个大型的体育场。这些建筑物环绕着广场，而广场本身则是一个宽阔开放的空间…整个欧洲的文明都在这个朴实的地方扎下根基。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The little man walked around the huge temple and passed some smaller temples on his right. Then he began to walk down some steps between several tall columns. When he reached the foot of the Acropolis, he went up a small hill and pointed out toward Athens: "The hill we are standing on is called Areopagos. It was here that the Athenian high court of justice passed judgment in murder trials. Many hundreds of years later, St. Paul the Apostle stood here and preached about Jesus and Christianity to the Athenians. We shall return to what he said on a later occasion. Down to the left you can see the remains of the old city square in Athens, the agora. With the exception of the large temple to Hephaestos, the god of smiths and metalworkers, only some blocks of marble are preserved. Let us go down…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个矮小的男人绕过巨大的神殿，经过右边几座较小的神庙。然后他开始沿着两边排列着高大石柱的梯阶走下去。到达高城的最低点时，他走上一座小山丘，用手遥指着雅典的方向：“我们现在站的这个小山丘是古代雅典的高等法院（Areopagos），也是雅典人审判杀人犯的地方。几百年以后，使徒保罗曾站在此处对雅典人宣扬耶稣基督的教诲。以后我们会谈到他所说的。在左下方，你可以看到雅典古老的市区广场（Agora）的遗迹，如今除了供奉铁匠与金属工人之神贺非斯托思（Hephaestos）的大神庙之外，只剩下几块大理石了。现在我们继续往下走…”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Words such as politics and democracy, economy and history, biology and physics, mathematics and logic, theology and philosophy, ethics and psychology, theory and method, idea and system date back to the tiny populace whose everyday life centered around this square. This is where Socrates spent so much of his time talking to the people he met. He might have buttonholed a slave bearing a jar of olive oil, and asked the unfortunate man a question on philosophy, for Socrates held that a slave had the same common sense as a man of rank. Perhaps he stood in an animated wrangle with one of the citizens -- or held a subdued conversation with his young pupil Plato. It is extraordinary to think about. We still speak of Socratic or Platonic philosophy, but actually being Plato or Socrates is quite another matter."</div>

<div class="line_en">Above the skyline Sophie could still see the Acropolis, but now both that and all the buildings down on the square were brand-new. They were covered with gold and painted in garish colors. Gaily dressed people were strolling about the square. Some wore swords, others carried jars on their heads, and one of them had a roll of papyrus under his arm.</div>

<div class="line_en">The philosopher rose from the block of marble he was sitting on and said quietly: "It was actually my intention to leave it at that, Sophie.

But I am not yet sure that you have grasped just how splendid these surroundings once were… so I am very tempted to go a bit further. It is quite irregular of course… but I am sure I can count on it remaining just between the two of us. Oh well, a tiny glimpse will suffice anyway…"</div>
