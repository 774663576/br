<div class="line_en">Jeb Blake leaned over his cup of coffee, speaking in a raspy voice. Nearly seventy, he was lean and tall-almost too thin-and his face was deeply wrinkled. The thinning hair on his head was almost white, and his Adam's apple protruded from his neck like a small prune. His arms were tattooed and scarred, covered with sun spots, and the knuckles on his hands were permanently swollen from years of wear and tear as a shrimper. If not for his eyes, a person would think he was frail and sick when looking at him, but in truth he was far from it. He still worked almost every day, though only part-time now, always leaving the house before daybreak and returning around noon.</div>

<div class="line_en">Rolling the first of the dozen cigarettes he would smoke a day, Jeb Blake stared at his son. For years his doctor told him he was killing himself by smoking, but because the doctor died of a heart attack at sixty, his father didn't put much faith in medical advice. As it was, Garrett assumed the old man would probably outlive him as well.</div>

<div class="line_en">A few minutes later they finished their coffee. Garrett tossed a couple of dollars onto the table and followed his father out of the diner, toward his truck in the parking lot. When Garrett finally got to the shop, a dozen different things were going through his head. Unable to concentrate on the paperwork he needed to do, he decided to go back to the docks to finish working on the engine he had started repairing the day before. Though he definitely had to spend some time in the shop today, at the moment he needed to be alone.</div>

<div class="line_en">Garrett pulled his toolbox from the back of his truck and carried it to the boat he used when he taught scuba diving. An older Boston Whaler, it was large enough to carry up to eight students and the necessary gear needed for underwater dives.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="盖瑞特从卡车后面拉出工具箱，将它带到他那艘带肺潜水教学船上。那是一艘更旧的“波士顿捕鲸者”，它足以装得下八名学员以及水下潜水的必要装备。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Working on the engine was time-consuming but not difficult, and he'd made good headway the day before. As he removed the engine casing, he thought about the conversation he'd had with his father. He'd been right, of course. There wasn't any reason to continue feeling the way he did, but-as God was his witness-he didn't know how to stop it. Catherine had meant everything to him. All she'd had to do was look at him and he'd feel as if everything were suddenly right in the world. And when she smiled... Lord, that was something he'd never been able to find in anyone else. To have something like that taken away... it just wasn't fair. And more than that, it just seemed wrong. Why her, of all people? And why him? For months he had lain awake at night, asking himself "What if." What if she'd waited an extra second before crossing the street? What if they had lingered at breakfast for another few minutes? What if he'd gone with her that morning instead of going straight to the shop? A thousand what ifs, and he was no closer to understanding the whole thing than he had been when it first happened.</div>

<div class="line_en">The sun rose overhead as he worked steadily, and he found himself wiping the sweat as it formed on his forehead. Yesterday at about this time, he remembered, he'd watched as Theresa walked down the docks toward Happenstance. He'd noticed her right away, if for no other reason than she was alone. Women who looked as she did almost never came down to the docks alone. Usually they were accompanied by wealthy, older gentlemen who owned the yachts that were moored on the other side of the marina. When she stopped at his boat, he'd been surprised, though he'd expected her to pause for only a moment before moving on to her final destination. That's what most people usually did. But after watching her for a little while, he realized that she had come to the docks to see Happenstance, and the way she kept pacing around made it seem as if she were there for something else as well.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在他稳步工作的当儿，太阳升上了头顶，他拭去了额上的汗水。他记得，昨天这个时候，他正看着特丽莎从码头上走下来，朝“意外号”走去。如果她不是独自一人，他不会立即注意到她。通常像她这样的女人身边都有富有、年长的绅士陪伴，他们拥有私人快艇，快艇停靠在船坞另一侧。当她在他的船边停下来时，他很吃惊，他以为她只会停留片刻，然后就会朝她的最终目的地走去。大部分人都是这样。但是他观察了她一会儿，他意识到她是专程到码头来看“意外号”的，看她四下走动的样子，似乎她此行还有别的目的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Trying to clear his mind, he concentrated on the task at hand. He removed the bolts that held the carburetor in place and removed it from the engine. Carefully he began to take it apart, making sure nothing was too worn inside. He didn't think that this was the source of the problem, though he wanted a closer look just to make sure.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="试着理清脑中烦乱的思绪，他把注意力集中到手中的工作上。他取下了固定化油器的螺栓，将它从发动机上取下来。小心翼翼地将它拆开，看看里面有没有什么太旧了。虽然他认为问题不是出在这里，但他还是想仔细看看以便确定。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He shook his head then, knowing that didn't make any sense. She said she'd read the articles in the shop-maybe that's where the strange look came from. He thought about it, finally deciding that had to be the case. He knew he'd never met her before-he would have remembered something like that-and besides, she was vacationing from Boston. It was the only plausible explanation he could come up with, but even now there was some thing that didn't sit quite right about the whole situation.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后他摇了摇头，知道那毫无意义。她说过，她在商店里读过那些文章——也许她那奇怪的表情就是因为这些。他想了想，最后断定肯定是这样。他知道他之前从来没有见过她——如果见过，这样的女人他是不会忘记的——除此外，她是从波士顿来度假的。这是他能想到的唯一可能的理由，但甚至是现在，整件事依然有什么地方不对劲的地方。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His curiosity aroused, he'd gone over to speak with her. At the time, he didn't notice it, but when he was closing up the boat later in the evening, he realized there was something odd in the way she had first looked at him. It was almost as if she recognized something about him that he usually kept buried deep within himself. More than that, it was as if she knew more about him than she was willing to admit.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的好奇心被点燃了，他走过去跟她攀谈。在当时，他没有注意到，但是当天晚上，他朝船走近时，他意识到她看他的第一眼有点奇怪。就好像她在他身上认出了什么，那是他通常深埋于心底的秘密。不仅如此，好像她对他所知的比她愿意承认的更多。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They'd gone sailing, enjoyed each other's company, and said good-bye. That was the end of it. As he'd told his father, he couldn't reach her again even if he wanted to. Right now she was probably on her way back to Boston, or she would be in a few days, and he had a hundred things to do this week. Summer was a popular season for diving classes, and he was booked up every weekend until late August. He had neither the time nor the energy to call every hotel in Wilmington to find her, and even if he did, what would he say? What could he say that wouldn't sound ridiculous?</div>

<div class="line_en">With these questions rolling through his mind, he worked on the engine. After finding and replacing a leaking clamp, he reinstalled the carburetor and the engine casing and cranked the motor. The engine sounding much better, he freed the boat from its lines and took the Boston Whaler out for forty minutes. He ran it through a series of speeds, started and stopped the engine more than once, and when satisfied, returned the boat to its slip. Pleased that it had taken less time than he'd thought it would, he collected his tools, returned them to his truck, and drove the couple of blocks to Island Diving.</div>

Ian, one of his summertime employees, was on the phone when Garrett walked up and handed him three slips of paper.

When she entered the shop, both Ian and Garrett stared at her as she glanced around. Finally spotting him, she smiled and called out, "Hi," from where she was standing, and Ian raised his eyebrow at Garrett, as if to ask "What haven't you been telling me?" Garrett ignored the expression and moved toward Theresa with her jacket in hand.

<div class="line_en">Hank's had been in business since the pier was built and was frequented by locals and tourists alike. Low in ambience but high in character, it was similar to the pier restaurants they had on Cape Cod-wooden floors scraped and scuffed by years of sandy shoes, large windows offering a view of the Atlantic Ocean, pictures of trophy fish on the walls. Off to one side was a door that led to the kitchen, and Theresa saw plates of fresh seafood loaded on trays, carried by waiters and waitresses dressed in shorts and blue T-shirts emblazoned with the name of the restaurant. The tables and chairs were wooden, sturdy looking, and decorated by the carvings of hundreds of former visitors. It wasn't a place that required more than casual beachwear, and Theresa noticed that most of the people there looked as though they had been lying in the sun most of the morning.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="自从码头建起后，汉克斯就开始营业了，不仅当地人时常光顾小店，游客也趋之若鹜。小店的环境很低调，但品质优良，它和科德角湾上的其他码头餐馆相似——同样是木地板。被沾满沙子的鞋子长年累月地刮擦，地板已经磨损了；透过宽大的窗户望去，太平洋美景一览无余；墙上挂着很多热带鱼图片。店一边是一扇通往厨房的门，特丽莎看到托盘里装满了一盘盘的新鲜海鲜，身着短裤和蓝T恤的男女服务生们端着碗碟在小店中不停地穿梭，他们的T恤上印着餐馆的名字。餐桌和椅子都是木制的，看起来很结实，来往的成百上千位顾客在上面留下了其雕刻大作。在这个地方就餐，身着随意的海滨泳装也无伤大雅，特丽莎注意到那里的大部分人看起来好像上午大部分时间都躺在太阳底下。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The food arrived a few minutes later, and they continued their conversation as they ate. This time Garrett spoke more than she did, telling her what it was like growing up in the South, and why he'd never leave given the choice. He also told her about some of the adventurous things that had happened while sailing or scuba diving. She listened, fascinated. Compared with the stories that the men told up in Boston-which usually focused on business accomplishments-his stories were completely new to her. He spoke about the thousands of different sea creatures he had seen on his dives and what it was like to sail through a storm that had come up unexpectedly and nearly capsized his boat. One time he'd even been chased by a hammerhead shark and was forced to take cover in the wreck he'd been exploring. "I almost ran out of air before I could come up," he said, shaking his head at the memory.</div>

<div class="line_en">Theresa watched him closely as he spoke, pleased that he had loosened up compared with the evening before. She still noticed the things she had last night-the lean face, his light blue eyes, and the easy way he moved. Yet there was energy in the way he spoke to her now, and she found the change appealing. No longer did he seem to be measuring every word he said. They finished their lunch-he was right, the food was delicious-and went through a second beer each as the ceiling fans whirred overhead. With the sun rising steadily in the sky, it was hot in the restaurant now, but no less crowded. After the bill arrived, Garrett put some money on the table and motioned for them to leave.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在他侃侃而谈时特丽莎仔细观察着他，很高兴地发现相较于昨晚，他已经明显放松了下来。她依然注意到昨晚曾注意到的东西——他瘦长的脸，那双淡蓝色的眼睛，还有他随意的动作。然而现在，他对她说话的方式蕴含着力量，她发现这种转变极为诱人。他不再斟词酌句。他们吃完了午餐——他所言非虚，食物很美味——当吊在天花板上的吊扇在他们头顶开始呼啦旋转时，他们又各自干掉了一瓶啤酒。现在太阳已经稳稳当当地升上了天空，餐馆里闷热难当，但顾客依然不减。账单送来时，盖瑞特将钱放在餐桌上，示意他们离开。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"How about a walk along the beach? It's usually a little cooler down by the water." When she said yes, he led her to the side of the pier and started down the steps, walking beside Theresa. The steps were slightly warped and thinly layered with sand, forcing them to hold the railings as they made their way down. Once they reached the beach, they turned toward the water, walking beneath the pier. The shade was refreshing in the midday heat, and when they reached the compact sand at the edge of the tide, both of them stopped for a moment to remove their shoes. All around them, families were crowded onto towels and splashing in the water.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“到海滩上散散步怎么样？在海边通常会凉快一点。”她说好，于是，他前面开路，带她走到码头边，走下台阶，他和特丽莎并肩而行。台阶有点歪斜，每一级都很薄，上面布满了沙子，逼得他们在往下走时不得不抓住栏杆。他们一到海滩，便朝海水走去，在码头下行走。此时正是正午时分，烈日当头，热浪滚滚，码头下的阴凉处很是怡人，当他们走到海浪边结实的沙滩上时，两人都停下片刻，脱掉了鞋子。他们周围全都是一家子，或挤在沙滩巾上，或在水里嬉戏。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Garrett surveyed the freshly planted pansies lining the porch. He smiled. "They're great, but don't you think you should have left some of the dirt in the flower bed?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="盖瑞特审视着门廊两旁刚种下的紫罗兰。他笑了。“超棒的，但是难道你不认为花坛里该留点儿泥土吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"How do you like the flowers?" She gestured at a freshly turned patch of soil.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你喜欢这些花儿吗？”她指着一块新翻的泥土。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Her knees were dark from kneeling in the dirt, and a streak of mud ran across her cheek. Her hair was escaping from a messy ponytail, and her face was red and sweating from exertion.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她的膝盖因跪在泥土里变得漆黑，一道泥痕从她脸上穿过。凌乱的发丝从蓬乱的马尾辫上散落下来，她的脸通红，因卖力干活而大汗淋漓。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She wiped her forehead with the back of her hand and stood, squinting up at him in the bright sunlight. "Do I look that bad?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她用手背擦了擦额头，站在那里，在明晃晃的阳光下眯起双眼，抬头看他。“我看起来是不是很糟糕？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You look perfect."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你看起来堪称完美。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He sighed and finally turned his head. Theresa was staring at him, waiting. He spoke softly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他叹了口气，扭转头。特丽莎正凝望着他，静静等待着。他轻声开口了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Catherine took off her gloves and tossed them on the porch. "I'm not perfect, Garrett, but thanks. C'mon, let me get you some lunch. I know you've got to get back to the shop."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凯瑟琳脱下手套，将它们扔到门廊上。“拜托，我不完美，盖瑞特，但还是谢谢你的虚伪，好吧，让我给你准备午餐。我知道你待会儿还得赶回店里去。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"She was everything I ever wanted. She was beautiful and charming, with a quick sense of humor, and she supported me in everything I did. I'd known her practically my whole life-we went to school together. We got married a year after I graduated from UNC. We were married for six years before the accident, and they were the best six years I ever had. When she was taken away..." He paused as if he were at a loss for words. "I don't know whether I'll ever get used to being without her."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“她是我曾经想要的一切。她美丽迷人，机智幽默，无论我干什么她都鼎力支持。我们自小认识——我们一起上学。从卡罗来纳大学毕业一年后我们就结婚了。在事故发生前，我们已经结婚了六年，那是我这辈子过得最幸福的六年。当她被带走时……”他顿了顿，好像不知道该怎么说好，“我不知道自己能否习惯没有她的生活。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After a few moments, Garrett absently tossed the remaining shells into the water. "I'm sorry about that," he said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="过来好一会儿，盖瑞特漫不经心地将剩下的贝壳扔进海水中。“对不起，跟你说这些。”他说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The way he spoke about Catherine made Theresa hurt for him more than she would have imagined. It wasn't just his voice, but the look on his face before he described her-as if torn between the beauty of his memories and the pain of remembering. Though the letters had been touching, they hadn't prepared her for this. I shouldn't have brought it up, she thought. I already knew how he felt about her. There wasn't any reason to make him talk about it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他讲凯瑟琳的方式让特丽莎比想象的更为他难过。不仅仅是他的声音，也包括他在描述她之前脸上的神情——好像他在记忆的美丽和回忆的痛苦之间被撕扯。尽管那些信已经感人至深，但它们还没有让她准备好面对这真实的一幕。我不该提这个，她想，我已经知道他对她的感受了。没有任何理由让他亲口说出来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But there was, another voice in her head suddenly chimed in. You had to see his reaction for yourself. You had to find out whether he was ready to put the past behind him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是有理由的，她头脑中的另一个声音突然插进来。你得亲眼看看他的反应。你得弄明白他是否已经准备好将过去留在身后。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“什么？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I shouldn't have told you about her. Or so much about me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不应该跟你讲她，你还有自己的许多事。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I didn't mean to come off sounding like I did." He spoke as if he'd done something wrong. Theresa's reaction was almost instinctive.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我本不想用刚才那种语气来讲的。”他说，好像自己做错了什么。特丽莎几乎是本能地做出反应。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's okay, Garrett. I wanted to know. I asked you about her, remember?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没事的，盖瑞特。我想知道。是我让你谈她的，记得吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Stepping toward him, she reached for his hand. Taking it slowly in hers, she squeezed it gently. When she looked at him, she saw surprise in his eyes, though he didn't try to pull away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她朝他走去，把手伸向他，慢慢地将他的手握在自己手里，轻柔地捏了捏。她深情地望着他，她看到他眼里的吃惊，但是他没有试着把手抽回去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我知道，只是已经过了三年了……”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You lost a wife-something that most people our age don't know anything about." He lowered his eyes as she struggled for the right words.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你失去了深爱的妻子——这是我们大部分同龄人都没有体会过的。”当她挣扎着找适当的话来安慰他时，他垂下了双眼。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She squeezed his hand again, and Garrett felt her touch warm him. For some reason he didn't want to let go.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她又捏了捏他的手，盖瑞特感到她的触摸温暖了他。不知为何，他不想她放开。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They turned around and started back to the pier, talking quietly about the last three years, still holding hands. By the time they reached his truck and headed back to the shop, Garrett was more confused than ever. The events of the past two days were just so unexpected. Theresa wasn't just a stranger anymore, nor was she just a friend. There was no question he was drawn to her. But then again, she'd be gone in a few days, and he knew that it was probably better that way.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们转身向后凝望着码头，静静地谈着过去的三年，依然手牵着手。他们走到他的卡车边，然后朝海岛潜水店开车行去，盖瑞特比以往任何时候都更困惑。过去几天发生的事情太出人意料了。特丽莎不再只是个陌生人，也不仅仅是个朋友。毫无疑问，他被她吸引住了。但是问题又来了，过几天她就要走了，而他认为也许那样更好。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"What are you thinking?" she asked. Garrett shifted the truck into a higher gear as they made their way over the bridge toward Wilmington and Island Diving. Go ahead, he thought. Tell her what's really going through your head.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你在想什么？”她问，当他们经过大桥朝威尔明顿和海岛潜水店开去时，盖瑞特将卡车调到更高的挡位上。勇敢向前，他想。告诉她你头脑中真正的想法。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="她笑了。“我正盼望着你这么说。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我在想，”他终于开口了，自己吃了一惊，“如果你今晚没有什么安排，我想请你过来吃晚餐。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was still surprised at himself for asking as he turned left onto the road that led to his shop.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当他转弯向左拐上通往商店的马路时他依然对自己做出的邀请暗自心惊。">查看中文翻译</div>
