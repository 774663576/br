<div class="line_en">Thornfield Hall became quite busy the next day, now that the master had returned. People kept coming to visit him on business. I enjoyed the new, cheerful atmosphere. But I could not make Adele concentrate on her lessons because she was constantly talking about the presents Mr Rochester had promised to bring her. That evening we were invited to have tea with him. I immediately recognized the traveller I had helped, with his dark hair and skin, his square forehead and his stern look. His leg was supported on a chair, but he made no effort to greet me when I entered. In fact, he neither spoke nor moved.</div>

<div class="line_en">"That's enough!" he called after a few minutes. "Yes, you do indeed play a ittle, just like any schoolgirl, better than some perhaps. Now, bring me your sketches." I fetched them from my room Having looked carefully at them, he chose three.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“够了！”几分钟后他喊道。“是的，你的确只会一点儿，和其他女学生一模一样，可能比有的还弹得好一点儿。现在把你的素描拿来看看。”我从房间把画取来，他仔细看了看，挑出了三张。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"And you stayed there eight years, so you are now eighteen?" I nodded. "I would never have been able to guess your age," he went on. "Now, what did you learn there? Can you play the piano?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"These are interesting," he said. "You have only expressed the shadow of your ideas, because you aren't good enough at drawing or painting, but the ideas, where did they come from? Who taught you to draw wind, and space, and feeling? But put them away now, Miss Eyre. Do you realize it's nine o'clock? Adèle should be in bed by now. Good night to you all." Mr Rochester's mood had suddenly changed, and he clearly wished to be alone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“很有意思。”他说。“你只是表达了你的想法的影子，因为你不善绘画，可是这些想法，都是从哪儿来的？谁教你画风、画空间、画情感的？不过，收起来吧，爱小姐。你知道已经9点钟了吗？阿黛拉该上床了。各位晚安。”罗切斯特先生的情绪忽然变了，他显然想单独待着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, there was a lot of bad feeling in the family. The father was very fond of money, and wanted to keep the family property together, so the elder brother inherited most of it. I don't know what happened, but I do know Mr Edward (that's the master) quarrelled with his family. That's why he's travelled so much. When his brother died, he inherited Thornfield, but I'm not surprised he doesn't come here often."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“唉，他家里感情不好。父亲非常贪财，希望把家族的产业守在一起，因此老大继承了大部分产业。我不知出了什么事，但我知道爱德华先生（就是主人）曾和他的家人吵过架，这就是为什么他常常出游。他哥哥死后，他继承了特恩费得，但他不常回来，我并不感到奇怪。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="几天后的一个晚上，我被邀请在晚饭后和罗切斯特先生谈话。在房间的一角，阿黛拉正兴致勃勃地向费尔法斯太太讲述她得到的礼物。罗切斯特先生让我离火近些。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I don't like the conversation of children or old ladies," he murmured to me. "But they are entertaining each other at the moment, so I can amuse myself." Tonight he did not look so stern, and there was a softness in his fine, dark eyes. As I was looking at him, he suddenly turned and caught my look.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不喜欢小孩子和老太太的对话。”他悄悄对我说。“可是她们正互相逗趣，我自己也可以找点乐。”今晚他看上去没有那么严肃了，他漂亮的黑眼睛里透着温柔。我正看着，他突然转过身来，碰到了我的目光。">查看中文翻译</div>
