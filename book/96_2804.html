<div class="line_en">Howl opened the door toward the end of the afternoon and sauntered in, whistling. He seemed to have got over the mandrake root. It did not make Sophie feel any better to find he had not gone to Wales after all. She gave him her very fiercest glare.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="近傍晚时，哈尔打开店门晃进来，边吹着口哨，他似乎已经由曼陀罗花根带给他的震惊中恢复过来。但是发现他没有去威尔斯，并未让苏菲觉得好过些。她给他最恶毒的一瞥。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes!" growled Sophie. "And don't give me that about being in mourning! Which one is it really?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“就是有！”苏菲吼道：“别跟我来什么‘守丧中’那一套！到底这是哪一件？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Howl shrugged and held up one trailing sleeve as if he were not sure which it was. He stared at it, looking puzzled. The black color of it ran downward from his shoulder into the pointed, hanging tip. His shoulder and the top of his sleeve grew brown, then gray, while the pointed tip turned inkier and inkier, until Howl was wearing a back suit with one blue-and-silver sleeve whose end seemed to have been dipped in tar. "That one," he said, and let the black spread back up to his shoulder again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈尔耸耸肩，拉起一边垂下的长袖，仿佛他自己也不太确定到底是哪一件。他望着袖子，露出困惑的表情，袖子的黑色开始由肩膀一路往下退，退到垂着的袖子尖端。他的肩膀与袖子上部先是变成褐色，然后转灰，尖尖的袖端则越来越黑，越来越像墨汁，直到那件黑衣的一只袖子变成蓝色和银色，尾端则好像在沥青桶里浸过。“就是这个。”说完，他让黑色又爬回肩膀。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"He is?" said Howl, and he set off toward the dog with a speed that showed he was quite glad to get away from Sophie. This of course was the last thing the dog-man wanted. He backed away. Howl pounced, and caught him by two handfuls of shaggy hair before he could reach the door. "So he is!" he said, and knelt down to look into what could be seen of the sheepdog's eyes. "Sophie," he said, "what do you mean by not telling me about this? This dog is a man! And he's in a terrible state!" Howl whirled round on one knee, still holding the dog. Sophie looked into Howl's glass-marble glare and realized that Howl was angry now, really angry.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“什么？”哈尔说着，对狗冲过去，速度之快显示他很高兴能离开苏菲。狗人当然不愿意，它往后退。哈尔扑过去，在它逃到门口前双手抓住两把长毛。“果然没错。”他蹲下来看进牧羊犬的双眼。“苏菲，”他问：“你什么意思？瞒着我这样的事？这狗是一个人呢！它的状况非常可怜！”他以一个膝盖做轴心转过来，手里仍抓着狗。苏菲看着哈尔玻璃珠似的眼睛，知道他在生气，而且是非常生气！">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="哈尔气得不想听，他跳起来，将狗拖过地板。“如果我不是心里有事的话，早发现了。”他说：“过来，我要你来卡西法前面。”狗四只脚紧抓着地板，哈尔用力拉它，它死命撑着、滑着。“麦可！”哈尔大叫。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Then I let you off and just blame Sophie," Howl said, hauling the dog through the broom cupboard. "Anything like this is always Sophie! But you knew, didn't you Calcifer?" he said as the two of them dragged the dog in front of the hearth.</div>

<div class="line_en">Calcifer surged to a deep, roaring blue. Sophie, watching prudently from the door of the broom cupboard, saw the shaggy dog shape fade away inside the man shape. It faded to dog again, then back to man, blurred, then hardened. Finally, Howl and Michael were each holding the arm of a ginger-haired man in a crumpled brown suit. Sophie was not surprised she had not recognized him. Apart from his anxious look, his face was almost totally lacking in personality.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡西法高涨成一股吼叫的、深蓝色的焰火，苏菲站在储物柜的门口慎重看着。她看到长毛狗的形象在人的形象内消失，人又消失成狗，再变为人，然后是一片模糊，接着，影像逐渐具体化，最后，哈尔跟麦可各抓着一个穿着皱巴巴棕色套装，有赤黄色头发男子的一只臂膀。苏菲一点也不奇怪为何她没认出他来，因为虽然他脸上满是焦虑，但他的脸几乎完全没有个性。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The dog-man tried to get away, but Howl got his shoulder under its chest and shoved, so that it went up onto its hind legs, willy-nilly. Then he and Michael held it there. "What's the silly creature holding out for?" Howl panted. "This feels like one of the Witch of the Waste's again, doesn't it?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="狗人试着逃跑，但是哈尔将肩膀顶在它胸部用力推，令它以后腿站起来。他跟麦可就这样抓着它。“这笨蛋干吗一直抗拒？”哈尔气喘吁吁。“感觉上好像又是女巫的杰作，不是吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Calcifer was an unusually sickly shade of blue. "All right," he said sulkily.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡西法的脸色变成不寻常的病恹恹的蓝色，悻悻然地说：“好啦！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Do I have to ask you?" Howl said. "All right, I should have noticed myself! But you disgust me, Calcifer! Compared with the way the Witch treats her demon, you live a revoltingly easy life, and all I ask in return is that you tell me things I need to know. This is twice you've let me down!

<div class="line_cn" title="“这种事还要我问吗？”哈尔怒道：“好吧，我是应该自己发现。但是你令我作呕！那女巫师怎么对待她的火魔的？相较之下，你的生活简直好的令人嫌恶。我唯一要求的回报是你告诉我，我需要知道的事。但是，这是你第二次辜负我了！现在，立刻帮我把这家伙变回原形！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“不知道，”波西瓦说：“我什么都不记得。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Michael was suddenly seized with the most exciting idea. He leaned over Percival and asked, "Did you ever answer to the name of Justin -- or Your Royal Highness?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="麦可突然有一个令人非常兴奋的想法，他弯下腰问波西瓦说：“有没有人称呼你为贾斯丁或阁下过？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Though that seemed to mean Howl was no longer angry, Sophie found she was angrier than ever. She stumped off into the shop, where she banged about, shutting the shop and putting things away for the night. She went to look at her daffodils. Something had gone horribly wrong with them. They were wet brown things trailing out of a bucket full of the poisonous-smelling liquid she had ever come across.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽然那意味着哈尔似乎不再生气了，苏菲却觉得更气。她蹒跚地走到店里，把东西敲的震天响，然后关店，收拾东西。她走过去看那些喇叭水仙，它们显然发生很可怕的事，全都变为湿湿的褐色物体，垂在桶外。桶里则满是她所见过闻起来毒性最强的液体。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"What's all this, now?" said Howl, arriving in the shop. He bent over the bucket and sniffed. "You seem to have some rather efficient week-killer here. How about trying it on those weeds on the drive of the mansion?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“又怎么了？”哈尔来到店里，问道，他弯腰闻一闻，说：“这好像是非常有效的除草剂。那大房子车道旁的杂草开刀，试试它的威力怎么样？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Percival looked up anxiously. They had given him the guitar, rather as you gave a baby a rattle, and he was sitting making horrible twangings.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="波西瓦台起头来，脸上透着焦虑。他们把吉他拿给他，就像给小孩拨浪鼓一样，他一直坐在那儿玩吉他，弄出可怕的噪音。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I will," said Sophie. "I feel like killing something!" She slammed around until she had found a watering can, and stumped through into the castle with the can and the bucket, where she hurled open the door, orange-down, onto the mansion drive.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我会的，”苏菲说：“我想杀些什么！”她四处翻得嘭嘭作响，终于找到一个洒水壶。她带着这个洒水壶和那桶除草剂进入城堡，用力打开门，桔色向下，去到大房子的车道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, confound it all!" Sophie yelled.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“噢，该死的！”苏菲大叫。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So Percival laid down the guitar and took the bucket carefully out of Sophie's hand. Sophie stumped out into a golden summer evening at the end of the valley. Everyone had been much too busy up to now to pay much attention to the mansion. It was much grander than Sophie had realized. It had a weedy terrace with statues along the edge, and steps down to the drive. When Sophie looked back-on the pretext of telling Percival to hurry up -- she saw the house was very big, with more statues along the roof, and rows of windows. But it was derelict. Green mildew ran down the peeling wall from every window. Many of the windows were broken, and the shutters that should have folded against the walls beside them were gray and blistered and hanging sideways.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="波西瓦放下吉他，将桶子小心翼翼地由苏菲手中接过来。苏菲走出大门，迎接她的是山谷尾段金黄色的夏日黄昏。截至目前为止，每个人都太忙，无暇顾及这间大宅，它比苏菲所知的还要壮观，外头有个杂草丛生的阳台，四周饰有雕像。由阳台可以走下车道。当苏菲回头想叫波西瓦走快些时，她发现这房子实在很大，沿着屋顶还有更多的雕像，然后是整排整排的窗户，但整个房子都荒废了。绿色的霉长满了每个窗口下剥落的墙，许多窗子都破了，而原该收好、靠在窗边的木板套窗都成了灰色，油漆都已斑驳。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="苏菲走了约莫车道的四分之一，边走边杀杂草。当波西瓦替她加满洒水壶时，她指责他：“你记得的远比你招供的多。女巫到底想由你那里得到什么？那次她为何带你到店里来？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Percival meekly did as she said. He was no fun at all to bully. Sophie suspected that was why Howl had sent him with her. She snorted, and took her anger out on the weeds. Whatever the stuff was that killed the daffodils, it was strong. The weeds in the drive died as soon as it touched them. So did the grass at the sides of the drive, until Sophie calmed down a little, the evening calmed her. The fresh air was blowing off the distant hills, and clumps of trees planted at the sides of the drive rustled majestically in it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="波西瓦顺从地照做了。凶这个人一点都不好玩，苏菲怀疑这就是为什么哈尔会要他跟过来的原因。她哼哼出声，把怒气出在杂草上，不论杀死喇叭水仙的到底是什么东西，它的毒性确实很强！车道上的杂草一碰到它就死，连车道旁的草皮都跟着遭殃，一直到苏菲情绪稍稍平复下来为止。是傍晚的气氛令她平静下来，新鲜的空气由远方的山丘吹拂过来，种在车道旁的树从随之飒飒作响。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Huh!" said Sophie. "I think the least Howl could do is to make the place look a bit more lived in. But no! He's far too busy gadding off to Wales! Don't just stand there, Percival! Pour some of that stuff into the can and then come along behind me.</div>

It caught up with me just as I'd got to a farm, and the people there saw me change into a dog and thought I was a werewolf and tried to kill me. I had to bite one to get away.

<div class="line_en">"No, but I must have known something. It had to do with the curse she'd put on him," Percival explained, "but I've no idea what it was. She took it, you see, after we came to the shop. I feel bad about that. I was trying to stop her knowing, because a curse is an evil thing, and I did it by thinking about Lettie. Lettie was just in my head. I don't know how I knew her, because Lettie said she'd never seen me when I went to Upper Folding. But I knew all about her -- enough so that when the Witch made me tell her about Lettie, I said she kept a hat shop in Market Chipping. So the Witch went there to teach us both a lesson. And you were there. She thought you were Lettie. I was horrified, because I didn't know Lettie had a sister."</div>

She said, 'Something terrible has happened to Sophie! And the worst of it is she'll think she's safe from Howl. Sophie's too kind herself to see how heartless Howl is!'

<div class="line_en">Sophie shuddered. Since the scarecrow was out on the road, she did not dare leave now. She picked up the watering can and stumped back to the mansion. A fluttering caught her eye as she went. She looked up at the building. The flutter was from long white curtains blowing from an open French window beyond the statues of the terrace. The statues were now clean white stone, and she could see curtains at most of the windows, and glass too. The shutters were now folded properly beside them, newly painted white. Not a green stain nor a blister marked the new creamy plaster of the house front. The front door was a masterpiece of black paint and gold scrollwork, centering on a gilded lion with a ring in its mouth for a doorknocker.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="苏菲全身发抖。既然稻草人就在路上某处，她就不敢离开了。她捡起洒水壶，走回大宅，边走着，她突然注意到有什么在飘动着，她抬起头来，看到阳台雕像后头敞开的法式窗子，有长长的白色窗帘在飘扬。雕像都变成干净的白色石雕，几乎每个窗户都挂上窗帘，并且装上了玻璃。木制的套窗都新上过白漆，好好地收在窗旁。屋前新刷上的白石膏上见不到一点绿斑或泡泡。前门更是个精心杰作——黑漆大门加上金色的蔓叶花饰，中间是只镀金的狮子，嘴里衔环，作为叩门之用。">查看中文翻译</div>
