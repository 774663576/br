<div class="line_en">Dick Hallorann's flight was called at 6:45 A. M., EST, and the boarding clerk held him by Gate 31, shifting his flight bag nervously from hand to hand, until the last call at 6:55. They were both looking for a man named Carlton Vecker, the only passenger on TWA's flight 196 from Miami to Denver who hadn't checked in.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Just coffee, babe," he said, and went down the aisle to a seat in the smoking section. He kept expecting the no-show Vecker to pop through the door like a jack-in-the-box at the last second. The woman in the seat by the window was reading You Can Be Your Own Best Friend with a sour, unbelieving expression on her face. Hallorann buckled his seat belt and then wrapped his large black hands around the seat's armrests and promised the absent Carlton Vecker that it would take him and five strong TWA flight attendants to drag him out of his seat. He kept his eye on his watch. It dragged off the minutes to the 7:00 takeoff time with maddening slowness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“来一杯咖啡，宝贝儿，”他说，然后沿过道走去，在吸烟区找到了一个座位。他一直期待着尚未露面的韦科最后一秒钟突然撞进门来。挨着窗子的座位里的女人在看一本《做自己最好的朋友》，脸上带着鄙夷、不信任的表情。哈洛伦扣上安全带，然后将两只粗大的黑手牢牢地套在扶手上，暗自发誓，未露面的韦科加上五个强壮的机组人员才能把他从座位上拽出去。他一直盯着手表，时间终于一分钟一分钟地捱到了七点正，慢得简直让人发疯。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He had spent the night at the airport, going from counter to counter -- United, American, TWA, Continental, Braniff -- haunting the ticket clerks. Sometime after midnight, drinking his eighth or ninth cup of coffee in the canteen, he had decided he was being an asshole to have taken this whole thing on his own shoulders. There were authorities. He had gone down to the nearest bank of telephones, and after talking to three different operators, he had gotten the emergency number of the Rocky Mountain National Park Authority.</div>

<div class="line_en">"No, we are not," Staunton said angrily. Hallorann was relieved at the sound of anger in the voice. For the first time he felt he was speaking to a man and not to a recording. "I'm the only man here, sir. Every other ranger in the park, plus game wardens, plus volunteers, are up in Hasty Notch, risking their lives because three stupid assholes with six months' experience decided to try the north face of King's Ram. They're stuck halfway up there and maybe they'll get down and maybe they won't. There are two choppers up there and the men who are flying them are risking their lives because it's night here and it's starting to snow. So if you're still having trouble putting it all together, I'll give you a hand with it. Number one, I don't have anybody to send to the Overlook. Number two, the Overlook isn't a priority here -- what happens in the park is a priority. Number three, by daybreak neither one of those choppers will be able to fly because it's going to snow like crazy, according to the National Weather Service. Do you understand the situation?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，我们没喝酒，”斯汤顿生气地说。哈洛伦听出声音中含着愤怒，他情绪缓和了一些。他第一次觉得他在跟人而不是跟一个录音装置说话。“这里只有我一个人，先生。公园里别的所有的森林管理员加上狩猎管理员和志愿者都冒着生命危险到哈斯蒂诺奇去了，因为三个只有六个月登山经验的蠢货想从金斯兰姆峰北面登上去。他们陷在了半路上，也许他们下得来，也许下不来。那里有两架直升机，驾驶员都冒着生命危险，因为现在天已经黑了，雪又下起来了。因此，要是你还有别的什么麻烦，请一起提出来，我会帮你一把。第一，我没有人可以派往远望饭店。第二，远望饭店在这里不是优先考虑的——公园里发生的事才是。第三，黎明之前直升机无法飞行，因为根据国家气象台的预报，今天夜里有暴风雪。这些情况你都明白吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
