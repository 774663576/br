<div class="line_en">Later, she'd listen to music. She'd saved the last two batteries Park had given her so that she could listen to her tape player today when she missed him most. She had five tapes from him now -- which meant, if her batteries lasted, she had four hundred and fifty minutes to spend with Park in her head, holding his hand.</div>

<div class="line_en">The only bad thing about their new bus routine was that it had seriously cut back on their conversations. She could hardly look at Park when he was touching her. And Park seemed to have a hard time finishing his sentences. (Which meant he liked her. Ha.)</div>

<div class="line_en">(Besides they didn't just hold hands. Park touched her hands like they were something rare and precious, like her fingers were intimately connected to the rest of her body. Which, of course, they were. It was hard to explain. He made her feel like more than the sum of her parts.)</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="（何况，那不只是牵手。帕克摸她的手，就好像在摸什么罕有又珍贵的东西，好像她的手指跟身体其他部位紧密相连。事实上也如此，很难解释。帕克让她觉得自己的身体不仅仅是各个部位的总和。）">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What?" Eleanor sat by the wall now, because it made her feel safer, less exposed. She could almost pretend that they had the bus to themselves.</div>

<div class="line_en">Yesterday, on the way home from school, their bus had to take a fifteen-minute detour because of a busted sewer pipe. Steve had started cussing about how he needed to get to his new job at the gas station. And Park had said, "Wow."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“他们叫我…哦…嗯…”然后他笑了，玩着她的小小波浪卷发。（抚弄她的头发是他们的最新进展，很棒。有时放学后，他会突然出现在她身后，抓一下她的马尾，或者拍打她的发髻。）">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He did have really cute hair. Really, really. Short in the back, but kind of long and fanned out in the front. It was completely straight and almost completely black, which, on Park, seemed like a lifestyle choice. He always wore black, practically head to toe. Black punk rock T-shirts over black thermal long-sleeved shirts. Black sneakers. Blue jeans. Almost all black, almost every day. (He did have one white T-shirt, but it said "Black Flag" on the front in big, black letters.)</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的头发，真的、真的，很可爱。后面短，前面长，自由地垂散着。他的头发很直，几近全黑。黑色似乎是帕克的生活态度。他总是穿黑色衣服，从头黑到脚。黑色的朋克乐队T恤，内搭黑色长袖衬衫。黑色球鞋。蓝色牛仔裤。嗯，几近全黑。天天如此。（他倒也有一件白色的，但胸前也是黑色大字“黑旗乐队”（44）。）【注：（44）黑旗乐队（Black Flag），美国硬核朋克乐队。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Whenever Eleanor wore black, her mom said that she looked like she was going to a funeral -- in a coffin. Anyway, her mom used to say stuff like that, back when she occasionally noticed what Eleanor was wearing. Eleanor had taken all the safety pins from her mom's sewing kit and used them to pin scraps of silk and velvet over the holes in her jeans, and her mom hadn't even mentioned it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="每次埃莉诺穿黑衣服，妈妈就说她像是去参加葬礼——是躺在棺材里的那个。总之，那是妈妈以前会说的话，那时她还会偶尔注意埃莉诺的穿着。埃莉诺拿走妈妈针线盒里所有的安全别针，把碎丝缎、天鹅绒别到牛仔裤的破洞上，她也一句话都没有。">查看中文翻译</div>
