<div class="line_en">He shrugged and Wendy saw Danny's paternity in the gesture; Jack could hardly have done it better himself. She would get no more out of Danny. She felt strong exasperation mixed with an even stronger love: the love was helpless, the exasperation came from a feeling that she was deliberately being excluded. With the two of them around she sometimes felt like an outsider, a bit player who had accidentally wandered back onstage while the main action was taking place. Well, they wouldn't be able to exclude her this winter, her two exasperating males; quarters were going to be a little too close for that. She suddenly realized she was feeling jealous of the closeness between her husband and her son, and felt ashamed. That was too close to the way her own mother might have felt… too close for comfort.</div>

He caught her looking at him and gave her a wink… a decidedly lecherous one. She looked away hurriedly. Jack was over by the window just outside the restaurant, studying the view. He looked rapt and dreamy.</div>

<div class="line_en">Wendy silently applauded the head clerk, who looked greatly relieved. Ullman looked like the type of man who might take any shortage out of the head clerk's hide… without ever spilling a drop of blood. Wendy didn't much care for Ullman or his officious, ostentatiously bustling manner. He was like every boss she'd ever had, male or female. He would be saccharin sweet with the guests, a petty tyrant when he was backstage with the help. But now school was out and the head clerk's pleasure was written large on his face. It was out for everyone but she and Jack and Danny, anyway.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="领班如释重负，温迪不禁暗暗为他感到高兴。厄尔曼看上去是这样一种人：他能敲出领班骨子里的每一个不是，但又不会让他溅出一滴血。温迪不太喜欢厄尔曼这个人和他那自以为是、故作忙碌的派头。他跟她见到过的每个老板——无论男女——都一个德行：在顾客面前笑容可掬，在背后对雇员却极尽专横之能事。但现在放假了，解放了，领班的喜悦心情明显地写在了脸上。是的，人人都放假了，除了杰克、丹尼和她。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes, sir." Braddock walked around the desk, his face sober and dignified, as befitted his position, but when his back was entirely to Ullman, he grinned like a schoolboy. He spoke briefly to the two girls still waiting by the door for their ride, and he was followed out by a brief burst of stifled laughter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是，先生，”领班走过服务台，表情庄重严肃，但是，完全背对厄尔曼后，他孩子似的做了个大鬼脸。他跟还在门边等着上车的两个姑娘说了点什么，她们忍不住哧哧笑起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now Wendy began to notice the silence of the place. It had fallen over the hotel like a heavy blanket muting everything but the faint pulse of the afternoon wind outside. From where she stood she could look through the inner office, now neat to the point of sterility with its two bare desks and two sets of gray filing cabinets. Beyond that she could see Hallorann's spotless kitchen, the big portholed double doors propped open by rubber wedges.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在，温迪开始注意到这个地方是多么地安静。寂静像一张厚重的毯子罩在饭店上，除了屋外微弱的风声，它裹住了一切。从她站立的地方可以看到饭店的办公室，现在，里面只有两张光秃秃的写字台和两套灰色的文件柜，整个房间整洁得如同医院的无菌室。再远些，她可以看到哈洛伦一尘不染的厨房，厨房的双扇门用橡胶楔子支开着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I thought I would take a few extra minutes and show you through the Hotel," Ullman said, and Wendy reflected that you could always hear that capital H in Ullman's voice. You were supposed to hear it. "I'm sure your husband will get to know the ins and outs of the Overlook quite well, Mrs. Torrance, but you and your son will doubtless keep more to the lobby level and the first floor, where your quarters are."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我原本就想额外花点时间带你们转转饭店，”厄尔曼说。温迪注意到，厄尔曼在说“饭店”两个字时加重了语气——你准能听出来！“托兰斯夫人，我相信你丈夫会逐渐熟悉饭店的里里外外的，但你和你儿子无疑更多的时间将待在一楼和你们住的二楼。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Let's go up to third and work our way down," Ullman said. He sounded positively enthused.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们先上四楼，然后一路下来，”厄尔曼说，兴致很高。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"So was the Titanic," Jack said, looking up at the cut-glass globe in the center of the elevator ceiling. Wendy bit the inside of her cheek to keep the smile away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“泰坦尼克号客轮也这么安全，”杰克说，仰头看着电梯天花板中央的雕花玻璃灯。温迪咬住腮帮子，忍住没笑出来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Not at all," Ullman said: "The shop is shut. Tout fins, for this season, at least. And I plan to overnight in Boulder -- at the Boulderado, of course. Only decent hotel this side of Denver… except for the Overlook itself, of course. This way." They stepped into the elevator together. It was ornately scrolled in copper and brass, but it settled appreciably before Ullman pulled the gate across.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没关系，”厄尔曼说。“饭店关张了。彻底关了，至少对这一季来说是这样。今晚我准备住在博尔德——当然是在博尔德拉多饭店。这一带唯一一家体面的饭店…当然，除了远望饭店之外。这边请。”他们一起走进了电梯。黄铜和红铜的涡形装饰使电梯看上去华丽无比，可是在厄尔曼拉上门之前，电梯明显地下沉了一些。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Wendy had a vision of the four of them being trapped between floors like flies in a bottle and found in the spring… with little bits and pieces gone… like the Donner Party…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="温迪设想了一幅景象：他们四个陷在楼层之间，就像封在瓶子里的苍蝇，春天里他们被发现了…尸体上这里少一块，那里缺一片…就跟唐纳登山队一样…">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That's reassuring," Jack said. He ruffed Danny's hair. "The plane ain't gonna crash, doc."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这倒让人很放心，”杰克说。他搓了搓丹尼的头发，接着说：“博士，飞机不会坠毁。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The elevator began to rise, with some vibration and clashing and banging from below at first. Then the ride smoothed out. At the third floor Ullman brought them to a bumpy stop, retracted the gate, and opened the door. The elevator car was still six inches below floor level. Danny gazed at the difference in height between the third-floor hall and the elevator floor as if he had just sensed the universe was not as sane as he had been told. Ullman cleared his throat and raised the car a little, brought it to a stop with a jerk (still two inches low), and they all climbed out. With their weight gone the car rebounded almost to floor level, something Wendy did not find reassuring at all. Safe as houses or not, she resolved to take the stairs when she had to go up or down in this place. And under no conditions would she allow the three of them to get into the rickety thing together.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="电梯开始上升，最初一会儿下面有些振动和碰撞，后来逐渐平稳下来。上到四楼，厄尔曼哐当一声停下电梯，拉开电梯厢的门，推开了外面的门。电梯厢离楼层还有六英寸。丹尼瞪着四楼走廊与电梯间的那个高差，仿佛刚刚觉悟到，这个世界并非像人们告诉他的那样合情合理。厄尔曼清了清嗓子，开始把电梯厢往上升，电梯猛地一搡，停了下来（还低两英寸），他们都登了上去。减去了他们的重量，电梯厢升上来，大致与楼层地面平齐了。温迪可没发现这是什么让人放心的东西，不管它是否像楼房一样安全，她都打定主意在这里只爬楼梯。无论如何她都不会让他们三个一起踏进这个不可靠的东西。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ullman was not amused. He slid the inner gate across with a rattle and a bang. "The Titanic made only one voyage, Mr. Torrance. This elevator has made thousands of them since it was installed in 1926."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="厄尔曼可不感到这有什么好笑的。他哐啷哐啷地拉上电梯厢的门，说：“托兰斯先生，泰坦尼克只做过一次航行，但是，这部电梯自从1926年安装以来上上下下过成千上万次。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Of course not," Ullman said, nettled. "All the rugs were shampooed just two days ago." Wendy glanced down at the hall runner herself. Pretty, but definitely not anything she would choose for her own home, if the day ever came when she had one. Deep blue pile, it was entwined with what seemed to be a surrealistic jungle scene full of ropes and vines and trees filled with exotic birds. It was hard to tell just what sort of birds, because all the interweaving was done in unshaded black, giving only silhouettes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“当然不会有，”厄尔曼不快地说。“所有的地毯昨天都用香波洗过。”温迪自己也低头看了看走廊上铺的地毯。很漂亮，但是，如果有一天她有了自己的家，她绝不会选用这种地毯。地毯深蓝的底子上织着扭曲缠结的丛林图案，里面布满了藤蔓树木，还有许多奇异的鸟儿。很难认出那些是什么鸟，因为图案用的是不分明暗的黑色，只能让人看出那些东西的轮廓。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They walked down the hall, which was comfortably wide. The wallpaper was silk, a lighter blue to go against the rug. Electric flambeaux stood at ten-foot intervals at a height of about seven feet. Fashioned to look like London gas lamps, the bulbs were masked behind cloudy, cream-hued glass that was bound with crisscrossing iron strips.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们顺着宽宽的走廊向前走着。墙纸是丝质的，浅蓝色，与地毯的深色形成对比。装饰烛台装在大约七英尺高的地方，每隔10英尺一个，样式像伦敦的气灯，电灯外装着乳白色玻璃罩，并用交叉纵横的窄铁皮固定着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jack and Wendy were so absorbed in the view that they didn't look down at Danny, who was staring not out the window but at the red-and-white-striped silk wallpaper to the left, where a door opened into an interior bedroom. And his gasp, which had been mingled with theirs, had nothing to do with beauty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杰克和温迪忘情于眼前的美景，一时没顾上看看丹尼。此时丹尼没有往窗外看，却盯着左边墙上带着红白相间条纹的真丝墙纸，那儿开着一道门，通往里面的卧室。让他跟爸爸妈妈一起屏住呼吸的，原来不是窗外的景色。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It sure is," Jack said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“当然，”杰克说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ullman nodded, pleased. "Mr. Derwent had those installed throughout the Hotel after the war -- number Two, I mean. In fact most -- although not all -- of the third-floor decorating scheme was his idea. This is 300, the Presidential Suite."</div>

The clouds around and behind this picture-postcard view were also tinted gold, and a sunbeam glinted duskily down into the darkly pooled firs below the timberline.</div>

<div class="line_en">He twisted his key in the lock of the mahogany double doors and swung them wide. The sitting room's wide western exposure made them all gasp, which had probably been Ullman's intention. He smiled. "Quite a view, isn't it?"</div>

Danny said he did, although he didn't really care for the mountains, one way or the other. As Ullman was closing the door behind them, Danny looked back over his shoulder. The bloodstain had returned, only now it was fresh. It was running. Ullman, looking directly at it, went on with his running commentary about the famous men who had stayed here.

They were all sweets up here, Mr. Ullman said, although Danny didn't see any candy.

<div class="line_en">This fire extinguisher was a little older than others he had seen -- the one in the nursery school, for instance -- but that was not so unusual. Nonetheless it filled him with faint unease, curled up there against the light blue wallpaper like a sleeping snake. And he was glad when it was out of sight around the corner.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这条消防管比他以前看到过的都旧一些——比如幼儿园那一条——这有什么大惊小怪的呢？然而，它蜷在淡蓝色的墙纸上，像一条入睡的蛇，给他心中带来了惴惴不安的感觉。转过墙角，消防管看不见了，他感到十分庆幸。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was an old-fashioned extinguisher, a flat hose folded back a dozen times upon itself, one end attached to a large red valve, the other ending in a brass nozzle. The folds of the hose were secured with a red steel slat on a hinge. In case of a fire you could knock the steel slat up and out of the way with one hard push and the hose was yours. Danny could see that much; he was good at seeing how things worked. By the time he was two and a half he had been unlocking the protective gate his father had installed at the top of the stairs in the Stovington house. He had seen how the lock worked. His daddy said it was a NACK. Some people had the NACK and some people didn't.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是一条老式消防管：一卷盘了十几圈的软布管，一端连在一个红色的大阀门上，另一头接着一个黄铜喷嘴。丹尼知道这种消防管怎么用，搞清楚这些玩意儿的工作原理对他来说很容易。两岁半的时候，他就常打开他爸爸装在他们家楼梯口的安全门。他明白锁是怎么管用的，他爸爸说这是窍门儿，有的人会窍门儿，有的人不会。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Of course all the windows have to be shuttered," Mr. Ullman said as they stepped back into the elevator. Once again the car sank queasily beneath their feet. "But I'm particularly concerned about the one in the Presidential Suite. The original bill on that window was four hundred and twenty dollars, and that was over thirty years ago. It would cost eight times that to replace today."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“当然，所有的窗户都得关上窗板，”他们回到电梯里后，厄尔曼说。电梯厢又往下沉了一些，不免让人心里直打鼓。“但我想特别关照一下总统套间的那一栋。原价420美元，可这是30年前的事了。现在要更换可得花8倍那么多。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then down to the first floor. Mr. Ullman didn't show them into any rooms here until they had almost reached the thickly carpeted staircase that led down into the lobby again. "Here are your quarters," he said. "I think you'll find them adequate." They went in. Danny was braced for whatever might be there. There was nothing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们又下到了二楼。厄尔曼先生没带他们去看这层楼的客房，他们直接来到紧挨着楼梯间——楼梯铺着厚厚的地毯，向下直通往前了——的一套房间门前。“你们就住这里，”厄尔曼说。“我想你们会发现这套房间够用了。”他们走了进去。不管里面有什么糟糕的东西，丹尼都已经做好了准备。但是，什么也没有。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They went down to the second floor where there were more rooms and even more twists and turns in the corridor. The light from the windows had begun to fade appreciably now as the sun went behind the mountains. Mr. Ullman showed them one or two rooms and that was all. He walked past 217, the one Dick Hallorann had warned him about, without slowing. Danny looked at the bland number -- plate on the door with uneasy fascination.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们下到三楼，这儿的房间更多，甚至走廊上的弯弯拐拐也多一些。现在，太阳已经落山，窗外照进来的光线已经明显地暗淡下去了。厄尔曼先生只带他们看了一两个房间。他径直走过了217房间——就是哈洛伦要丹尼别进去的那个房间——连脚步都没慢下来。丹尼望着平淡无奇的门牌，心里很不自在。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Wendy Torrance felt a strong surge of relief. The Presidential Suite, with its cold elegance, had made her feel awkward and clumsy -- it was all very well to visit some restored historical building with a bedroom plaque that announced Abraham Lincoln or Franklin D. Roosevelt had slept there, but another thing entirely to imagine you and your husband lying beneath acreages of linen and perhaps making love where the greatest men in the world had once lain (the most powerful, anyway, she amended). But this apartment was simpler, homier, almost inviting. She thought she could abide this place for a season with no great difficulty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="温迪—托兰斯大大地松了一口气。总统套间那种冷冰冰的精致考究使她感到局促不安、无所适从——参观某座复原历史建筑，也许它墙壁上挂的匾牌还宣称亚伯拉罕—林肯或富兰克林—罗斯福在此就寝，这确实不错。但是，想像自己和丈夫躺在几英亩亚麻织物下，也许还要在世界上最伟大的（不，应该是最有权势的）人物曾经躺过的地方做爱，那就完全是另外一回事了。但这套房间简朴得多，它更像一个家，简直算得上温馨可爱了。她想，在这里逗留一冬对她来说没有什么大问题。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No kitchen, of course," Ullman said, "but there is a dumb-waiter. This apartment is directly over the kitchen." He slid aside a square of paneling and disclosed a wide, squarer tray. He gave it a push and it disappeared, trailing rope behind it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“当然，没有厨房，”厄尔曼说。“但有一部送菜的升降机。这套房间恰好在厨房正上方。”他取下一张墙板，露出一个大大的方托盘。他推了一下，托盘不见了，后面跟下来一条绳子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It's a secret passage!" Danny said excitedly to his mother, momentarily forgetting all fears in favor of that intoxicating shaft behind the wall. "Just like in Abbott and Costello Meet the Monsters!" Mr. Ullman frowned but Wendy smiled indulgently. Danny ran over to the dumb-waiter and peered down the shaft.,</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“秘密通道！”丹尼兴奋地对妈妈说，一时忘记了墙后那个迷魂的深洞可能会带来的所有恐惧。“跟动画片《阿伯特和科斯特罗遇妖记》中一样！”厄尔曼皱起了眉头，但温迪慈爱地笑了。丹尼跑到升降机旁边，伸着脑袋往竖井里瞅。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"This way, please." He opened the door on the far side of the living room. It gave on the bedroom, which was spacious and airy. There were twin beds. Wendy looked at her husband, smiled, shrugged.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这边请。”厄尔曼打开了起居室靠里的一道门。那是一间卧室，里面宽敞、通风，有两张单人床。温迪看着丈夫，对他笑了笑，耸了耸肩。">查看中文翻译</div>

He led them back into the sitting room, where a second door opened on a second bedroom, this one equipped with bunk beds. A radiator clanked in one corner, and the rug on the floor was a hideous embroidery of western sage and cactus -- Danny had already fallen in love with it, Wendy saw. The walls of this smaller room were paneled in real pine.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“啊，当然，”厄尔曼说，一时没明白过来。很快，他的脸色明朗起来，一道红晕从脖子根爬了上来。“随便你们。”他们跟厄尔曼回到起居室，接着又跟他进了另一间卧室。这间屋子里有一张上下床。暖气片在角落里呼呼作响，地毯上粗糙地绣着鼠尾草和仙人掌——温迪看出，丹尼已经喜欢上了这张地毯。这间小屋子的墙裙是用真正的松木镶成的。">查看中文翻译</div>
