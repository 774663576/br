<div class="line_en">Young anthropologists know all about missionaries before they've met any. They play a large role in the demonology of the subject, beside self-righteous administrators and exploitative colonials. The only intellectually respectable response to a tin rattled in one's face by someone collecting for missionary work is a reasoned refutation of the whole concept of missionary interference. The documentation is there. Anthropologists point out, in their introductory courses to students, the excesses and shortsightedness of Melanesian missions that culminated in cargocults and famines. The Brazilian orders in the Amazon are charged with trading in slaves and child prostitutes, stealing land and intimidating the natives with force and threats of Hellfire. Missions destroy traditional cultures and self-respect, reducing peoples all over the globe to the state of helpless, baffled morons living on charity and in economic and cultural thraldom to the West. The great dishonesty lies in exporting to the Third World systems of thought that the West itself has largely discarded.</div>

<div class="line_en">To my great surprise, I was received with much warmth. Far from being rampant cultural imperialists, I found the missionaries -- except for one or two of the old school -- to be extremely diffident about imposing their own views. Anthropology seemed, in fact, to be accorded a rather embarrassingly high position as a sovereign remedy against unfortunate cultural misunderstandings -- a position which I could not honestly have claimed for it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大大出乎意料，我受到热情欢迎。我发现传教士并非猖獗的文化帝国主义者（少数一两个老派传教士除外），相反，他们极端谦虚，不将自己的观点强加于别人。相较之下，人类学似乎被捧上难堪的高位，成为对抗文化误解的特效药——这是我无法衷心接受的位置。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">All this was in the back of my mind when I reached the American mission at N'gaoundere. It was something of a betrayal of anthropological principles even to be talking to missionaries: anthropologists have been obsessed with keeping themselves free of this taint since Malinowski, self-styled inventor of fieldwork, first issued his impassioned cry to the ethnographer to get up off the mission veranda and go out into the villages. Still, I would be on my guard against the devil's wiles and might save myself much time by talking to people who had actually lived in Dowayoland.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当我抵达恩冈代雷的美国教会时，内心深处正是这种想法。就连与传教士说话，都好像背叛了人类学：因为自从号称发明田野调查的马林诺夫斯基呼吁人类学者从教会的阳台起身，走进部落做研究，人类学者便惶恐沾上与教会打交道的污点。我会小心提防魔鬼诡计，何况我若想省时间，便应与真正的多瓦悠住民接触。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">My original contact was Ron Nelson, who ran a mission radio studio whose programmes were distributed over much of West Africa -- when the transmitters were not being nationalized by any particular government. He and his wife radiated a sort of calm strength far removed from the god-squad hysteria I had rather expected; after all, anyone who went out to Christianize the heathen must be a religious fanatic. I certainly found the latter among some of the more extreme groups working in Cameroon, people who railed against me for taking a couple of fertility dolls back to Europe on the grounds that I was importing the devil into God's territory; they should be burnt, not exhibited. Fortunately they were in the minority and, it seemed, a declining one if the younger missionaries I met were anything to go by.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我碰到的第一个传教士是朗恩·尼尔森（Ron Nelson），他经营一个教会电台，播音范围涵盖西非洲大部分地区（发射器非属国有的地方）。他和太太散发着一股静谧的力量，远非我想象中歇斯底里的上帝卫队（毕竟愿意远渡重洋、驯化异教徒皈依基督的人必定是个宗教狂）。我的确在一些较极端的宗教团体中看过这类疯子，当我打算带几尊繁生偶像（fertility doll）回欧洲时，他们抨击我将魔鬼带进上帝的国度；这些偶像应当被焚毁，而不是拿来展览。幸好，这类宗教狂是少数，如果我碰到的年轻传教士成为主流，他们将更趋式微。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On the whole, it was surprising how much work was being done on the local cultures and languages, translation work, pure linguistic research and attempts to adapt liturgy to local symbolic idiom; my own research would have been quite impossible without the mission's support. My funds having now been incautiously committed to the maw of an African bank, it was thanks to a loan from the mission that I was able to set myself up for the field in the first place. When I was ill, the mission hospital patched me up. When I was stranded, the missionaries put me up. When I ran out of supplies, they let me buy at their store which was theoretically only for their own personnel. To the jaded, ravenous fieldworker this was an Aladdin's cave of imported goodies at reduced prices.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="整体而言，我很讶异传教士完成了许多工作，包括对当地文化、语言、翻译、语言学的研究，并将祈祷文翻译成当地的符号语言。没有教会的协助，我的研究绝不可能完成。我的研究经费不小心被非洲银行吞下肚，全靠教会借钱给我，才能开始设立田野工作点。当我生病，教会治愈我。当我束手无策，教会给我打气。当我的补给品耗尽，教会让我在理论上只供所属人员使用的福利社买东西。对饥饿、疲惫的田野工作者而言，那个福利社是阿拉丁神灯里的宝库，提供便宜的进口物资。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The French missionaries also took me somewhat under their wing, clearly taking the view that we Europeans must stand together in the face of Americans. My favourite was Père Henri, a jolly, energetic extrovert. He had lived for a number of years with the nomadic Fulani and, as one of his colleagues put it, "never been able to bring himself to preach to them". He was totally in love with the people and spent hours discussing subtle points of grammar with so-called "pure Fulani" speakers. His room at the seminary out in the hills was a shrine and a laboratory. With the aid of the most amazing Heath Robinson devices he collected recordings from ethnographic informants, edited them, typed them up and cross-referenced them all with switches operated by a swipe of the elbow, a stamp of the foot, a bang of the knee. He was a man who seemed to rev at twice the speed of normal mortals. On hearing that I was after a vehicle for the bush, he immediately whisked me off on a whistlestop tour of his contacts that involved viewing a number of broken-down jalopies at inflated prices. We ended up at the airport bar, run by a typical French colonial who turned out to be a Cockney who knew a man who knew a man, etc. By the end of the afternoon cars were coming round for the second time and Père Henri had negotiated a complicated series of options and prerogatives with insurance I could fill in for myself to cover anything under the sun. In the end I bought Ron Nelson's car with money loaned from the mission and piled in some mission supplies, fully intending to take off immediately for the field. Various people had lent me material they had accumulated from the mission's twenty-odd years in Dowayoland, not just linguistic information but outlines of kinship organization (wildly wrong) and all manner of ethnographic odds and ends that enabled me to convince the Dowayos that I knew far more about their culture than I was letting on and would detect half-truths and evasions as easy as winking. I had corresponded with two Summer Institute of Linguistics researchers while still in England who had furnished me with a word-list, an outline of the verb system and the basic phonemes, so I felt as well equipped as anyone needed to be. I fondly pictured myself heading out into the bush the next morning, the air clean and fresh, to begin from scratch a ruthlessly profound analysis of the culture of my very own primitive people. It was at this point that bureaucracy laid me low again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="法国教会也相当照顾我，显然认为欧洲人必须团结对抗美国人。我最喜欢的法国传教士是活力十足、快乐外向的佩雷·亨利（Pére Henri）。他曾和游牧民族富来尼人（Fulani）生活好几年，据他的同事说，他始终“无法提起勇气向富来尼人传教”。他热爱富来尼人，每天花数小时与会说“纯”富来尼语的人讨论文法细节。亨利位于山丘顶耶稣会的房间是圣坛，也是图书馆。他录下许多与民族志报告人（informant）的谈话。靠着神妙如希思·鲁滨逊（Heath Robinson）的机器，辅以手肘推撞、脚踩、膝盖撞击各种复杂开关，他还完成了所有的资料整编、打字、交叉对比。他是那种转速比常人快一倍的人。当他听说我需要一辆车子进入丛林，马上带我旋风般走访各种门路，包括看了几辆十分便宜、几乎要解体的老爷车。最后我们抵达机场酒吧，老板乍看是典型的法国殖民者，却是伦敦人，他认识某个人，那个人又认识一些有车要卖的人。下午，亨利又带我去看了一些车，并帮我谈妥复杂的保险选择，只要是在太阳底下发生的意外，都在保险之内。最后，我用教会借我的钱买了尼尔森的车子，装满补给品，准备立刻前往田野。他们也慷慨借了一些工具给我，那是教会扎根多瓦悠兰二十年，辛苦炮制出来的东西。除了语言学资料外，还有亲属关系表（错得离谱），以及民族志学的零碎资料，足以让我唬弄多瓦悠人——我熟悉他们的文化，要察觉他们是否说谎，易如反掌。我还在英国时，曾和“萨摩亚语言学研究所”里的两位研究员联络，取得多瓦悠语的词汇表，以及一份动词系统与基本音素的大纲。我自觉准备十分充分了，快乐地揣想第二天便可以进入空气干净清新的丛林，对“我的原始人”展开严谨无比的深入分析。就在这时，官僚作风再度将我击倒在地。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I trooped off to the préfecture with the required documents in my hand. Then began the most convoluted and bizarre paper-chase. I was told I would be charged £120 registration fee, and after only a small amount of the by now expected jostling and arrogance I secured a piece of paper to take to the Finance Ministry who rejected it on the grounds that it did not have 200 francs' worth of fiscal stamps on it to pay administration costs. Fiscal stamps, under rules apparently spontaneously invented for that day alone, could only be purchased at the post office at the counter marked "parcels". The post office had no fiscal stamps for any sum less than 250 francs, so I attached one of these. At the Finance Ministry this was held to be improper and contrary to good administrative order. The Inspector would have to decide what to do. Alas, it was to be regretted that the Inspector was "detained at lunch on business" but he would surely return. He did not return that day. I found a fatalistic Fulani taxi driver, similarly becalmed, who drew great comfort from his Muslim religion in this time of adversity. He was also involved in a major campaign to pay his electricity bill and rushed from one office to another trying to catch both off their guard. He was greeted with growing disapproval and I guessed that it was as punishment for his indecent haste that my piece of paper was finally stamped by competent authorities and I moved on to the next stage, after a mere three hours. Returning the next day, I revisited the office I had started from and exchanged all my pieces of paper for yet another in triplicate; these I exchanged after some hours for several more that I had stamped over on the other side of town (with but a short detour to buy more fiscal stamps). At the Finance Ministry the taxi driver was still there, deep in prayer, convinced that only direct supernatural intervention could aid him. I sped on past.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因此，我拿着所需文件出发前往县府，展开生平最错综复杂、诡异的追逐游戏。他们告诉我牌照登记费是一百二十镑，经过一番免不了却不算严重的推挤，我拿到宝贵的牌照登记表，送到财政部，他们却拒收，因为上面没有两百中非法郎的印花（用来支付行政费用）。根据此地规定，印花只限当日有效，而且仅邮局的“包裹”柜台有售。但是邮局没有低于两百五十法郎面值的印花，我便贴上两百五十法郎印花。回到财政部，他们却认为此举不符办事规矩，必须交由督察裁决。悲哀的是，督察被“公事饭局”耽搁了，稍晚一定会回来。他一直没回来。我看到一个宿命的富来尼计程车司机，同样在衙门里寸步难行，靠着穆斯林的信仰对抗逆境。他的重要战役是付电费，从一个办公室冲到另一个办公室，企图抽冷子逮住一个肯办事的人。办事人员对他越来越不客气，我想是在惩罚他的催促，毕竟我也不过才花了三个小时，就找到合格的人盖好章，可以进行下一阶段的公文跑件。第二天我重返财政部，回到最早的那间办公室，将手中的文件交出去，换来一式三份的表格；又经过数个小时的跑文，将这个一式三份的表格换成更多一式三份的表格，然后送到城的那一头盖章（中间只绕了一小段路去买所需印花）。这时，那个富来尼司机依然呆坐在财政部，虔诚祈祷，相信惟有上苍的直接干预，他才能获救。我快步从他身边走过。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The drive to Gouna, my turn-off, was through torrential rain and quite uneventful. The road was tarmac and, by local standards, good. Having been warned of certain of its more interesting features, I drove slowly as I descended from the plateau on to the plain and the temperature rose as if I were driving into an oven. One of the principal hazards of driving in the area is road-safety features. For example, there are a number of bridges which are only wide enough for one-way traffic. To ensure that drivers do not approach these at incautious speed, the authorities have judiciously placed a double line of bricks across the road -- in those days without warning signs -- on either side of the bridge. The burnt-out wrecks of cars and trucks whose drivers were unaware of this precaution are littered about the river beds. Many of them were killed. Spotting the new wrecks on the road was a standard way of relieving the boredom of driving through the featureless scrub. When one travelled by bush-taxi, each wreck was the occasion for a new story from the inevitable well-informed fellow passenger. Over there was a truck from Chad that had burst into flames because the petrol tank had been split open. That was the carcass of the motorbike ridden by two Frenchmen. They had been travelling at over eighty miles an hour when they hit the bricks and one had been impaled on the railings of the bridge.</div>

The man who had sent me off initially received me with great amusement at the préfecture and shooed other clients out of his office to offer me a chair. "Congratulations," he said with a huge grin. "Most people take much longer than that. Have you the documents, the receipts and the declaration?" All these were swiftly produced. He slipped them into a folder. "Thank you. Drop by next week." Rather melodramatically, I recoiled in horror. He smiled beatifically. "We have run out of registration cards, but expect them within a few days." It is some indication that I had begun to adapt that I stood my ground, argued with force and venom and left the office with a temporary card and the entire folder in my possession.</div>

There is a great difference between any landscape as represented on a British map of the ordnance survey type and the French map with which I had equipped myself.

<div class="line_en">For the first ten miles or so the dirt road was comparatively easy going. To either side of me stretched well-tended fields of what I clearly identified as maize and turned out to be millet, interspersed with areas of blackened scrubland. There, at last, hoeing contentedly in their gardens to either side of the road, were the people I had come to see, the Dowayos. First impressions were favourable. They smiled and waved, pausing in their endeavours to follow my passage up the road with their eyes and fell to lively discussion -- clearly attempting to identify me. The road gradually became worse and worse until it was just a series of shattered boulders and deep craters. I had clearly wandered from the track. At this point two small boys hurried up carrying their shoes on their heads to protect them from the mud. To my relief they spoke French. This was indeed the road. Was it not very bad? It had been better. I learnt later that the funds for its repair had mysteriously disappeared. The sous-préfet had, about the same time, bought a large, low, American car. It was held to be poetic justice that the state of the road prevented him driving it to town. I gladly gave the boys a lift to their school, which they assured me was just up the road. As we bucked and juddered along, we took on various others until I had a fine collection of seven or eight.</div>

Finally, it just ran out of steam in a tangle of undergrowth and a flagpole. I turned round, looking for the rest of it; there wasn't any. It had the air of a Wild West town down Mexico way during the siesta. A few ragged figures sidled about the streets and stared at me. A tin sign announced the presence of a bar, a depressing shanty tricked out in advertisements for the national lottery and the campaign against illiteracy. It was full of snappy expressions such as: "The illiterate adult, incapable and lacking information, has always constituted an obstacle to the setting of any initiative tending towards the general upliftment of a country." It was not clear how illiterates were supposed to read the placard. The bar was deserted but I slumped down on a stool and waited, glumly considering the sea of mud that made up the street.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="事实上，它只是个小村，仅有的一条街道延伸数百码，两旁是泥屋与铝片屋顶。数百码后，这条街便后继无力，消失于矮树丛与旗杆后面。我转身四顾，企图寻找路的踪迹，但是没有，它就此打住。波利小镇有墨西哥西部城镇的午觉气氛。几个衣衫褴褛的人在街上游走，瞪着我看。酒吧挂着锡制招牌，那是间惨淡的小屋，墙上的装饰是乐透彩券的广告与消除文盲运动的口号。它以抖擞的语气写道：“文盲缺乏能力与资讯，是迈向国家整体水准提升的障碍。”我不知道文盲要如何阅读这个告示。酒吧空无一人，但是我跌坐椅上，等待，忧愁地望着道路前方的泥海。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Having finally met my Dowayos, I was at something of a loss for conversation. "You are all Dowayos?" I inquired. There was a stunned silence. I repeated the question. As one, they roared with outrage. Haughtily, they disclaimed any kinship with that debased race of sons of dogs. They, it seemed, were Dupa. It was implied that no one but an idiot could confuse the two. The Dowayos lived over the other side of the mountain. Our conversation was over. Some ten miles or so further on they disembarked at their school, still looking somewhat affronted, and thanked me politely. I soldiered on alone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="终于遇见我的多瓦悠人，我反而不知该说些什么。“你们是多瓦悠人吗？”我问。惊人的沉寂。我重复问题。他们同声怒吼，傲慢否认与那种“狗崽子低级民族”有任何关系。他们是都帕（Dupa）人。只有笨蛋白痴才会搞混两者。多瓦悠人住在山的那一边。我们的谈话骤然结束。又开了十几英里，学校到了，下车时，他们脸上依然带着被侮辱的表情，礼貌向我道谢。我继续往前行。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Bars the world over are the place to go to get the feel of a town and the general lie of the land; this was no exception. After about ten minutes a furtive-looking man appeared and told me there was no point in my sitting there as they had run out of beer three weeks ago but the truck was expected within twenty-four hours. I was by now familiar with the disease of optimism and left, with directions to the Protestant mission.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="举世皆然，酒吧是你具体感受城镇气氛与谎言幻象的地方，毫无例外。十分钟后，一个脸色疲惫的男人出现，告诉我呆坐无用，啤酒三个星期前便卖完了，新货可望在一天内抵达。现在，我已经摸透这种无可救药的“乐观病”，转身离去，前往新教会。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This turned out to be a collection of tin-roofed houses such as I had come to recognize as the general mission style, grouped round a church of breeze blocks with a corrugated spire. The establishment was run by a wild-eyed American pastor and his family who had been in the business for some twenty-five years. It was an offshoot of the N'gaoundere mission and they had kindly offered to put me up until I got settled in a village. One thing had puzzled me: whenever I asked about the Poli mission people were immediately shifty or evasive. They spoke of the strains of the bush, the isolation, the heat. The first time I saw Pastor Brown, things began to fall into place. (Pastor Brown is not his real name and you can regard him-as a fictitious character if you like.)</div>

<div class="line_en">A bizarre figure sailed forth from the house, naked to the waist and exhibiting a huge paunch. On his head was a solar topee of imperial stamp, the effect of which was rather at variance with the bright purple sunglasses beneath. In his hand he bore a huge bunch of keys and a spanner. In the entire time I knew Herbert Brown I don't think I ever heard him finish a sentence, even though he used three languages simultaneously, switching from English to Fulani to French and back in the space of four words. A short, rapid burst of speech would be cut off by a Fulani oath, a gesture, a complete change of subject. His life-style was similar. He would punctuate a Bible class with welding a bicycle frame in the garage that was all his joy, abandoning this to rain blows on the aged generator of the station that was acting up, rushing off to dispense cough medicine at the house before the effectiveness of beating the generator had been established, and being waylaid before he got there by the need to chase goats from his garden or deliver a homily on the evils of debt. All this was accompanied by great screams and cries of rage, despair and frustration that turned him crimson in the face and led one to fear for his life. He believed fervently in the Devil with whom he was locked in a bitter personal combat. This explained why everything he tried to do for the people came to nought. The tractors he imported fell to pieces, the pumps broke down, the buildings fell apart. His life was an unabating whirlwind of struggle against entropy -- making do, mending, borrowing a bit from here to bodge that, using this to hold that down, sawing, cutting, hammering, beating.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一个奇怪的人影现身屋前，上身赤裸，露出便便大腹。他头戴遮阳帽，上面有大英帝国标记，与帽檐下的鲜紫色太阳眼镜形成不协调画面，手上拿着一大串钥匙与螺丝起子。打从我认识布朗牧师以来，从未听他完整说过一个句子，虽然他口操三种语言，短短四个字，便从英语说到富来尼语、法语又跳回英语，还不时以富来尼语咒骂、肢体动作、改变话题来打断原本就十分快速简短的句子。他的生活方式也类似如此。他可以突然放下经课，跑去最爱的车库敲打脚踏车钢圈；也可以把年迈失修、胡乱发作的发电机狠捶一顿，发电机还没有教训好，又跑去发放咳嗽药；半途可能又跑到园子里赶山羊，回去对会众发表讲道，抨击欠债的罪恶。这一团混乱还必定伴随尖叫与怒吼、绝望与挫折，脸色胀得猪肝红，让身旁人唯恐他一命呜呼。他强烈相信魔鬼存在，因为他就深陷一场与魔鬼的个人殊死战。这解释了为何他的努力总是变成泡影。他进口的农耕机碎成破片、水泵坏了、房子倾颓瓦解。他的生命就像一页与熵（entropy）的对抗史——将就使用、修修补补、挖东补西、左支右绌、锯这砍那、捶打敲击——漩涡般无止尽。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The station was engulfed in an atmosphere of manic tension that was totally opposed to that of the nearby Catholic mission; there, all was calm and well ordered. A single French priest ran the mission with his two "mothers", nuns who dispensed medicine. There were even flowers. The Dowayos explained this by pointing out that the Protestant was a blacksmith. Among the Dowayos, blacksmiths are a separate group, contacts with whom have to be strictly regulated. They cannot marry other Dowayos, nor eat with them, draw water with them or go into their houses. They are disruptive because of their noise and smell and the strange way they speak.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因为如此，这个教会充满疯狂紧张气氛，与邻近天主教堂恰成对比；那里宁静安详、一切有序。只有一位神父管理教会，手下两名修女负责分发药品。园子里甚至还种花呢！多瓦悠人对此有一解，他们说新教会的牧师是铁匠。在多瓦悠社会里，铁匠是隔离的阶级，与其他阶级的接触受到严格限制。铁匠阶级只能与铁匠阶级通婚，不能与其他多瓦悠人共食，也不能一起汲水或者进入他人的房子。铁匠必须与众人隔离，因为他们制造噪音、气味，还说话奇怪。">查看中文翻译</div>
