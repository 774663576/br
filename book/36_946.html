<div class="line_en">In the light of the world's attitude toward woman and her duties, the nature of Carrie's mental state deserves consideration. Actions such as hers are measured by an arbitrary scale. Society possesses a conventional standard whereby it judges all things. All men should be good, all women virtuous. Wherefore, villain, hast thou failed?</div>

<div class="line_en">For all the liberal analysis of Spencer and our modern naturalistic philosophers, we have but an infantile perception of morals. There is more in the subject than mere conformity to a law of evolution. It is yet deeper than conformity to things of earth alone. It is more involved than we, as yet, perceive. Answer, first, why the heart thrills; explain wherefore some plaintive note goes wandering about the world, undying; make clear the rose's subtle alchemy evolving its ruddy lamp in light and rain. In the essence of these facts lie the first principles of morals.</div>

<div class="line_en">The rooms were comfortably enough furnished. There was a good Brussels carpet on the floor, rich in dull red and lemon shades, and representing large jardinieres filled with gorgeous, impossible flowers. There was a large pier-glass mirror between the two windows. A large, soft, green, plush-covered couch occupied one corner, and several rocking-chairs were set about. Some pictures, several rugs, a few small pieces of bric-a-brac, and the tale of contents is told.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the view of a certain stratum of society, Carrie was comfortably established -- in the eyes of the starveling, beaten by every wind and gusty sheet of rain, she was safe in a halcyon harbour. Drouet had taken three rooms, furnished, in Ogden Place, facing Union Park, on the West Side. That was a little, green-carpeted breathing spot, than which, to-day, there is nothing more beautiful in Chicago. It afforded a vista pleasant to contemplate. The best room looked out upon the lawn of the park, now sear and brown, where a little lake lay sheltered. Over the bare limbs of the trees, which now swayed in the wintry wind, rose the steeple of the Union Park Congregational Church, and far off the towers of several others.</div>

<div class="line_en">Here, then, was Carrie, established in a pleasant fashion, free of certain difficulties which most ominously confronted her, laden with many new ones which were of a mental order, and altogether so turned about in all of her earthly relationships that she might well have been a new and different individual. She looked into her glass and saw a prettier Carrie than she had seen before; she looked into her mind, a mirror prepared of her own and the world's opinions, and saw a worse. Between these two images she wavered, hesitating which to believe.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="嘉莉就在这种惬意的地方安顿下来，摆脱了那些一直威胁着她的生活上的困顿，可是同时她又添上了许多心理上的负担。她的人际关系发生了如此大的改变，真可以把她看成是一个与旧日告别的新人。她从镜子里看到一个比以前漂亮的嘉莉，但是从她脑中的那面镜子里，她看到了一个比以前丑恶的嘉莉，那面镜子代表了她自己的看法和世俗的见解。她在这两个影象之间摇摆不定，不知道该相信哪个好。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the bedroom, off the front room, was Carrie's trunk, bought by Drouet, and in the wardrobe built into the wall quite an array of clothing -- more than she had ever possessed before, and of very becoming designs. There was a third room for possible use as a kitchen, where Drouet had Carrie establish a little portable gas stove for the preparation of small lunches, oysters, Welsh rarebits, and the like, of which he was exceedingly fond; and, lastly, a bath. The whole place was cosey, in that it was lighted by gas and heated by furnace registers, possessing also a small grate, set with an asbestos back, a method of cheerful warming which was then first coming into use. By her industry and natural love of order, which now developed, the place maintained an air pleasing in the extreme.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在前屋后面的卧室里，有嘉莉的一个大箱子，是杜洛埃给她买的。壁橱里挂着一长排衣服——她从未有过这么多衣服，而且款式和她那么相配。另外还有一个房间，打算作厨房，杜洛埃已经要嘉莉在那里装了一个简易活动煤气炉，以便烧些简单的便餐和杜洛埃爱吃的牡蛎、烤奶酪面包之类的食品。最后还有个洗澡间。整个房子很舒适，点着煤气灯，还有调温取暖设备，那种设备还带有一个衬着石棉的炉栅，是当时刚采用的，令人非常舒适愉快。由于嘉莉天生勤快爱干净，如今爱干净的脾气更有所发展，这地方收拾得非常舒适，令人愉快极了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Once the bright days of summer pass by, a city takes on that sombre garb of grey, wrapt in which it goes about its labours during the long winter. Its endless buildings look grey, its sky and its streets assume a sombre hue; the scattered, leafless trees and wind-blown dust and paper but add to the general solemnity of colour. There seems to be something in the chill breezes which scurry through the long, narrow thoroughfares productive of rueful thoughts. Not poets alone, nor artists, nor that superior order of mind which arrogates to itself all refinement, feel this, but dogs and all men. These feel as much as the poet, though they have not the same power of expression. The sparrow upon the wire, the cat in the doorway, the dray horse tugging his weary load, feel the long, keen breaths of winter. It strikes to the heart of all life, animate and inanimate. If it were not for the artificial fires of merriment, the rush of profit-seeking trade, and pleasure-selling amusements; if the various merchants failed to make the customary display within and without their establishments; if our streets were not strung with signs of gorgeous hues and thronged with hurrying purchasers, we would quickly discover how firmly the chill hand of winter lays upon the heart; how dispiriting are the days during which the sun withholds a portion of our allowance of light and warmth. We are more dependent upon these things than is often thought. We are insects produced by heat, and pass without it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="明媚的夏天一过去，城市披上了灰濛濛的外衣。整个长长的冬天，它穿着这件色调灰暗的外衣从事着各种活动。那无数的楼房，那天空，那街道，都蒙上了一层灰暗的色调。光秃秃的树木以及在风中飞舞的灰尘和废纸，更增添了阴沉严峻的气氛。寒风在长长窄窄的大街上扫过，风中似乎有什么东西引起人的惆怅。并非只有诗人、艺术家、或者感情细腻的上流人物才感受到了这种愁思。连狗和普通人都受了感染。他们的感受和诗人一样深刻，只是他们无法像诗人一样表达自己的感觉。停在电线上的麻雀，躲在门洞里的猫，还有负重跋涉的辕马，都感受到了悠长刺骨的冬的气息。世上万物，一切有生命的和没有生命的东西，都深切感受到这气息刺心入肺。要是没有那些欢乐的炉火，没有以营利为目的的商业活动，没有出售欢乐的游乐场所，要是没有那些在店堂内外照常展出的货物，没有街上那些花花绿绿的招牌，没有熙熙攘攘的顾客，我们会迅速感受到冰冷的冬之手沉重地压在我们心上。碰到阴雨天，太阳不肯赐予我们那一份应得的光和热，这种日子是多么让人沮丧埃我们对光和热的依赖，远远超出了常人的想象。我们只是一群由光和热孕育的昆虫，离开了光和热，我们就不复存在了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was when Carrie was alone, looking out across the park, that she would be listening to this. It would come infrequently -- when something else did not interfere, when the pleasant side was not too apparent, when Drouet was not there. It was somewhat clear in utterance at first, but never wholly convincing. There was always an answer, always the December days threatened. She was alone; she was desireful; she was fearful of the whistling wind. The voice of want made answer for her.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="这话在嘉莉听来，有点轻率不体谅人。她看得出杜洛埃的情感不那么细腻。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was referring to some property which he said he had, and which required so much attention, adjustment, and what not, that somehow or other it interfered with his free moral, personal actions.</div>

<div class="line_en">Carrie accepted this as basis for hope -- it was a sort of salve to her conscience, a pleasant way out. Under the circumstances, things would be righted. Her actions would be justified. She really was not enamoured of Drouet. She was more clever than he. In a dim way, she was beginning to see where he lacked. If it had not been for this, if she had not been able to measure and judge him in a way, she would have been worse off than she was. She would have adored him. She would have been utterly wretched in her fear of not gaining his affection, of losing his interest, of being swept away and left without an anchorage. As it was, she wavered a little, slightly anxious, at first, to gain him completely, but later feeling at ease in waiting. She was not exactly sure what she thought of him -- what she wanted to do.</div>

<div class="line_en">When Hurstwood called, she met a man who was more clever than Drouet in a hundred ways. He paid that peculiar deference to women which every member of the sex appreciates. He was not overawed, he was not overbold. His great charm was attentiveness. Schooled in winning those birds of fine feather among his own sex, the merchants and professionals who visited his resort, he could use even greater tact when endeavouring to prove agreeable to some one who charmed him. In a pretty woman of any refinement of feeling whatsoever he found his greatest incentive. He was mild, placid, assured, giving the impression that he wished to be of service only -- to do something which would make the lady more pleased.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="赫斯渥来访时，她发现他在各方面比杜洛埃聪明。他对她表示的那份恭维，是每个女人都会赏识的。他并不吓得唯唯诺诺，也不太放肆大胆。他的最大魅力是殷勤周到。他的职业使他训练有素，善于讨好那些春风得意的男性同胞，那些光顾他的酒店的商人和高等专业人员。那么，在遇到一个让他着迷的人物时，他当然会使出更高明的手段，博取好感。一个美貌女子，不管她有何种优美情感，总是激发他施展最大的魅力。他温和、宁静、自信，给人的印象是他只想为你效劳——能做些什么令女士更高兴。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Drouet had ability in this line himself when the game was worth the candle, but he was too much the egotist to reach the polish which Hurstwood possessed. He was too buoyant, too full of ruddy life, too assured. He succeeded with many who were not quite schooled in the art of love. He failed dismally where the woman was slightly experienced and possessed innate refinement. In the case of Carrie he found a woman who was all of the latter, but none of the former. He was lucky in the fact that opportunity tumbled into his lap, as it were. A few years later, with a little more experience, the slightest tide of success, and he had not been able to approach Carrie at all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在这种事情上，杜洛埃也是很有一套的，只要他认为值得下一番功夫。但是他太自高自大，缺乏赫斯渥那份温文尔雅。他太轻浮快活，太爱寻欢作乐，又太自信了。他在勾引那些初出茅庐，缺乏爱情经验的姑娘时往往成功。但是碰到稍有经验，情感高雅的女子时，他就一筹莫展，不能得手了。在嘉莉身上，他看到的是后一类姑娘，而不是前者。事实上，机会自己送上门来，他太运气了。再过几年，筹嘉莉稍有一点阅历，生活上稍稍顺利一些，那他就别想接近她了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He was in the best form for entertaining this evening. His clothes were particularly new and rich in appearance. The coat lapels stood out with that medium stiffness which excellent cloth possesses. The vest was of a rich Scotch plaid, set with a double row of round mother-of-pearl buttons. His cravat was a shiny combination of silken threads, not loud, not inconspicuous. What he wore did not strike the eye so forcibly as that which Drouet had on, but Carrie could see the elegance of the material. Hurstwood's shoes were of soft, black calf, polished only to a dull shine. Drouet wore patent leather but Carrie could not help feeling that there was a distinction in favour of the soft leather, where all else was so rich. She noticed these things almost unconsciously. They were things which would naturally flow from the situation. She was used to Drouet's appearance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天晚上，他保持着最佳精神状态来助兴逗趣。他穿着一身特别考究的新衣服，领子挺刮地翻下来，显然是用最高级的衣料做的。背心是用昂贵的苏格兰花呢做的，上面钉着两排珠母圆扣，他的领结是发光的丝织品，颜色既不花俏，也不太素净。他的衣服不像杜洛埃的那样引人注目，但是嘉莉可以看出料子的高雅。赫斯渥脚上穿了一双黑皮鞋，是用柔软的小牛皮做的，只擦得微微发亮。杜洛埃穿的是皮鞋。但是嘉莉感到，考究的衣服还是配软牛皮鞋好。她几乎是无意识地注意到这些细节。平常看惯了杜洛埃的穿着，在这种场合，这些细节自然而然地就显露了出来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It isn't very difficult," returned Hurstwood. "You could do very well in a few weeks."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Suppose we have a little game of euchre?" suggested Hurstwood, after a light round of conversation. He was rather dexterous in avoiding everything that would suggest that he knew anything of Carrie's past. He kept away from personalities altogether, and confined himself to those things which did not concern individuals at all. By his manner, he put Carrie at her ease, and by his deference and pleasantries he amused her. He pretended to be seriously interested in all she said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们来打尤卡朴克好吗？”谈了一会儿话以后赫斯渥提议说。他态度圆活，避开任何让人看出他知道嘉莉过去的话题。他的谈话完全不涉及个人，只说些和任何人无关的事情。他的举动使嘉莉感到轻松自如了，他的殷勤和风趣又让她感到愉快。对她说的每一句话，他都装出一副很认真很感兴趣的神气。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">By his tact he made Drouet feel that he admired his choice. There was something in his manner that showed that he was pleased to be there. Drouet felt really closer to him than ever before. It gave him more respect for Carrie. Her appearance came into a new light, under Hurstwood's appreciation. The situation livened considerably.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他这么使手腕，使得杜洛埃感到他很佩服他的选择。他的一举一动都表示他很乐意和他们在一起。于是杜洛埃感到和他更亲近了，这也增加了他对嘉莉的尊重。由于赫斯渥的赏识，他对她的美貌有了新的认识。气氛大大地活跃起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我不会打牌，”嘉莉说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“来，让我瞧瞧你的牌。”赫斯渥说着，彬彬有礼地从嘉莉背后看过去。“你有些什么牌？”他看了一会儿。“你的牌很不错，”他说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He did not look at her often. When he did, it was with a mild light in his eye. Not a shade was there of anything save geniality and kindness. He took back the shifty, clever gleam, and replaced it with one of innocence. Carrie could not guess but that it was pleasure with him in the immediate thing. She felt that he considered she was doing a great deal.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他并不经常看她。即使看时，也只用温和的目光。他的眼神里只显出愉快与和气，看不出一丝邪意。他把他的狡黠和精明都收了起来，显出一脸的正气。嘉莉毫无疑心，以为他醉心于眼前打牌的乐趣里。她感觉得出，他认为她打得很不赖。">查看中文翻译</div>
