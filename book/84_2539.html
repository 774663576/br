<div class="line_en">When January 1 dawned like any other morning, it broke Dad's spirit. He never again mentioned Y2K. He slipped into despondency, dragging himself in from the junkyard each night, silent and heavy. He'd sit in front of the TV for hours, a black cloud hovering.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mother said it was time for another trip to Arizona. Luke was serving a mission for the church, so it was just me, Richard and Audrey who piled into the old Chevy Astro van Dad had fixed up. Dad removed the seats, except the two in front, and in their place he put a queen mattress; then he heaved himself onto it and didn't move for the rest of the drive.</div>

<div class="line_en">As it had years before, the Arizona sun revived Dad. He lay out on the porch on the hard cement, soaking it up, while the rest of us read or watched TV. After a few days he began to improve, and we braced ourselves for the nightly arguments between him and Grandma. Grandma was seeing a lot of doctors these days, because she had cancer in her bone marrow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就像多年前一样，亚利桑那州的太阳又让爸爸复苏了。他躺在门廊外坚硬的水泥地面上，汲取着阳光，我们其他人则看书或看电视。几天后他的情况开始好转，我们便为他和奶奶晚上的争吵做好了准备。最近奶奶经常去看医生，因为她患了骨髓癌。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Those doctors will just kill you quicker," Dad said one evening when Grandma returned from a consultation. Grandma refused to quit chemotherapy, but she did ask Mother about herbal treatments. Mother had brought some with her, hoping Grandma would ask, and Grandma tried them -- foot soaks in red clay, cups of bitter parsley tea, tinctures of horsetail and hydrangea.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那些医生会更快地要了你的命。”一天晚上，奶奶就诊归来时爸爸说。奶奶拒绝停止化疗，但她确实也向母亲讨要过草药疗法。母亲带了一些草药来，希望奶奶向她求助，奶奶也试过——用红黏土泡脚，喝苦涩的欧芹茶，还有马尾和绣球花酊剂。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It's three in the morning, and we are making our way from southern to northern Utah, when the weather changes from the dry chill of the desert to the freezing gales of an alpine winter. Ice claims the road. Snowflakes flick against the windshield like tiny insects, a few at first, then so many the road disappears. We push forward into the heart of the storm. The van skids and jerks. The wind is furious, the view out the window pure white. Richard pulls over. He says we can't go any further.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那是凌晨三点，我们正从南往北穿越犹他州，天气突变，沙漠的干燥寒冷变为高山的寒风刺骨。道路冰封。雪花像小虫子一样拍打着挡风玻璃，一开始只有几片，一会儿便密到道路都看不清了。我们向暴风雪中心前进。面包车打滑、颠簸。狂风乱作，窗外一片白雪茫茫。理查德靠边停车。他说我们不能再往前走了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Richard sits tensely, his hand clutching the armrest, his knuckles bleaching each time the tires slip. Mother lies on her side, her face next to mine, taking small sips of air each time the van fishtails, then holding her breath as Dad corrects and it snakes back into the lane. She is so rigid, I think she might shatter. My body tenses with hers; together we brace a hundred times for impact.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="理查德紧张地坐着，紧握扶手，每次轮胎打滑，他的指关节都白了。母亲侧身躺着，脸紧贴我的脸，每次面包车摆尾行驶都倒吸一口气，然后屏住呼吸，直到爸爸调整好车开回车道。她太紧绷了，我觉得她可能会散架。我的身体随着她紧张起来；我们一起做好了一百次撞击的准备。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I awoke to blackness. Something ice-cold was running down my back. We're in a lake! I thought. Something heavy was on top of me. The mattress. I tried to kick it off but couldn't, so I crawled beneath it, my hands and knees pressing into the ceiling of the van, which was upside down. I came to a broken window. It was full of snow. Then I understood: we were in a field, not a lake. I crawled through the broken glass and stood, unsteadily. I couldn't seem to gain my balance. I looked around but saw no one. The van was empty. My family was gone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我在黑暗中醒来。有什么冰冷的东西沿着我的背流下来。我们掉进了湖里！我心想。有什么沉重的东西压在我身上。是床垫。我想把它踢开，但没成功，于是我就在它下面爬行，双手和膝盖压在翻过来的车顶上。我来到一扇破碎的车窗前。外面是茫茫白雪。接着我明白了：我们是在一片田野中，不是在湖里面。我爬出破碎的车窗，摇摇晃晃站起来，但似乎无法保持平衡。我环顾四周，可一个人影也没有。面包车是空的。我的家人不见了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I circled the wreck twice before I spied Dad's hunched silhouette on a hillock in the distance. I called to him, and he called to the others, who were spread out through the field. Dad waded toward me through the snowdrifts, and as he stepped into a beam from the broken headlights I saw a six-inch gash in his forearm and blood slashing into the snow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我绕着残骸转了两圈，才发现远处小山丘上爸爸弯腰驼背的身影。我喊他，他在喊其他人，他们都四散在田野中。爸爸穿过雪堆朝我走来，当他走进一束破碎的车头灯的光线中，我看见他前臂有一道六英寸的口子，鲜血在雪地上划出痕迹。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I was told later that I'd been unconscious, hidden under the mattress, for several minutes. They'd shouted my name. When I didn't answer, they thought I must have been thrown from the van, through the broken window, so they'd left to search for me.</div>

<div class="line_en">The police arrived, then an ambulance. I don't know who called them. I didn't tell them I'd blacked out -- I was afraid they'd take me to a hospital. I just sat in the police car next to Richard, wrapped in a reflective blanket like the one I had in my "head for the hills" bag. We listened to the radio while the cops asked Dad why the van wasn't insured, and why he'd removed the seats and seatbelts.</div>

<div class="line_en">I awoke one morning and it wouldn't move. It didn't hurt, not at first, but no matter how hard I concentrated on turning my head, it wouldn't give more than an inch. The paralysis spread lower, until it felt like I had a metal rod running the length of my back and into my skull. When I couldn't bend forward or turn my head, the soreness set in. I had a constant, crippling headache, and I couldn't stand without holding on to something.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一天早上醒来，我发现脖子无法动弹。一开始并不疼，但不管我怎么努力扭头，都无法移动超过一英寸。瘫痪往下延伸，感觉好像有一根金属杆沿着我的背部直插进颅骨。我没法向前弯腰或转头，一这么做就会疼痛。我还有了持续而剧烈的头痛，不抓住什么东西就站不起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mother called an energy specialist named Rosie. I was lying on my bed, where I'd been for two weeks, when she appeared in the doorway, wavy and distorted, as if I were looking at her through a pool of water. Her voice was high in pitch, cheerful. It told me to imagine myself, whole and healthy, protected by a white bubble. Inside the bubble I was to place all the objects I loved, all the colors that made me feel at peace. I envisioned the bubble; I imagined myself at its center, able to stand, to run. Behind me was a Mormon temple, and Kamikaze, Luke's old goat, long dead. A green glow lighted everything.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="母亲打电话给一位名叫罗西的能量专家。她出现在门口时我已卧床两周了，我看着她像波浪一样扭曲，仿佛是透过一摊水看她似的。她的声音高亢而欢快，让我想象自己完整而健康，被一个白色泡泡保护着。我要将一切喜欢的事物，所有让我感到平静的颜色都放在这个泡泡里面。我想象着这个泡泡，想象自己居其中心，能够站立、奔跑。我身后是一座摩门教教堂，还有卢克那只早已死去的老山羊“神风”。一道绿光照亮了一切。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It belonged to my brother Shawn, who'd quarreled with my father at seventeen and run off to work odd jobs, mostly trucking and welding. He'd come home because Dad had asked for his help. From my bed, I'd heard Shawn say that he would only stay until Dad could put together a real crew. This was just a favor, he said, until Dad could get back on his feet.</div>

<div class="line_en">I imagined the bubble every morning, afternoon and night, but my neck remained immobile. Slowly, over the course of a month, I got used to the headaches. I learned how to stand, then how to walk. I used my eyes to stay upright; if I closed them even for a moment, the world would shift and I would fall.

<div class="line_en">It was odd finding him in the house, this brother who was nearly a stranger to me. People in town seemed to know him better than I did. I'd heard rumors about him at Worm Creek. People said he was trouble, a bully, a bad egg, that he was always hunting or being hunted by hooligans from Utah or even further afield. People said he carried a gun, either concealed on his body or strapped to his big black motorcycle. Once someone said that Shawn wasn't really bad, that he only got into brawls because he had a reputation for being unbeatable -- for knowing all there was to know about martial arts, for fighting like a man who feels no pain -- so every strung-out wannabe in the valley thought he could make a name for himself by besting him. It wasn't Shawn's fault, really. As I listened to these rumors, he came alive in my mind as more legend than flesh.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在家里见到这个哥哥有点儿奇怪，对我来说他几乎是陌生人。镇上的人似乎比我更了解他。我在虫溪剧院听说过关于他的传言。人们说他爱惹麻烦，是个恶霸、坏蛋，总是和犹他州或者更远的街头流氓混在一起，不是去围追别人，就是被别人堵截。人们说他有枪，要么藏在身上，要么绑在他那辆黑色的大摩托车上。有人曾说，肖恩不是真坏，他跟人打架，只因有个打遍天下无敌手的名声——他深谙天下武术，打架时感觉不到疼痛——所以山谷里每个想混出点儿名堂来的愣头小子都认为打败他便可以崭露头角。其实这不是肖恩的错。听闻这些传言，他在我脑海中的形象栩栩如生，比起一个活生生的人，更像是一个传奇。">查看中文翻译</div>
