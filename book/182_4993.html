<div class="line_en">The place where they had met the Fauns was, of course, Dancing Lawn itself, and here Caspian and his friends remained till the night of the great Council. To sleep under the stars, to drink nothing but well water and to live chiefly on nuts and wild fruit, was a strange experience for Caspian after his bed with silken sheets in a tapestried chamber at the castle, with meals laid out on gold and silver dishes in the anteroom, and attendants ready at his call. But he had never enjoyed himself more. Never had sleep been more refreshing nor food tasted more savoury, and he began already to harden and his face wore a kinglier look.</div>

<div class="line_en">When the great night came, and his various strange subjects came stealing into the lawn by ones and twos and threes or by sixes and sevens -- the moon then shining almost at her full -- his heart swelled as he saw their numbers and heard their greetings. All whom he had met were there: Bulgy Bears and Red Dwarfs and Black Dwarfs, Moles and Badgers, Hares and Hedgehogs, and others whom he had not yet seen -- five Satyrs as red as foxes, the whole contingent of Talking Mice, armed to the teeth and following a shrill trumpet, some Owls, the Old Raven of Ravenscaur. Last of all (and this took Caspian's breath away), with the Centaurs came a small but genuine Giant, Wimbleweather of Deadman's Hill, carrying on his back a basketful of rather sea-sick Dwarfs who had accepted his offer of a lift and were now wishing they had walked instead.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那辉煌的夜晚终于来临了。明月当空，洒下一片皎洁的光芒，凯斯宾的那些形形色色、奇形怪状的臣民们三五成群地陆续来到跳舞场。看到这么多朋友，听着他们的欢歌笑语，凯斯宾不禁心花怒放。与他见过面的朋友全都来了，大棕熊、红小矮人和黑小矮人，还有鼹鼠、獾、兔子和刺猬，另外还有一些没见过面的朋友，如五个毛发火红的大猩猩，猫头鹰，甚至还有一群渡鸦。老鼠大军全副武装，踏着尖厉的喇叭声列队走来，真是威风凛凛。走在最后面的是和人头马一道来的巨人韦姆布威热。他巨大的身材使凯斯宾惊得目瞪口呆。巨人身后背着满满一筐子易晕船的小矮人，他们接受了他好心的提议，由他背了来。可是现在，他们一个个被颠得晕头转向，都后悔说，这一路还不如自己走的好。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When all the other creatures had been persuaded to sit down quietly in a great circle, and when (with more difficulty) they had got Pattertwig to stop running to and fro and saying "Silence! Silence, everyone, for the King's speech", Caspian, feeling a little nervous, got up. "Narnians!" he began, but he never got any further, for at that very moment Camillo the Hare said, "Hush! There's a Man somewhere near."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大家终于被他们说服，围成一圈坐了下来。然后他们又费了好大劲儿，才使佩蒂威格闭上嘴——它来回不停地奔跑，嘴里叫着：“静一静，静一静！请诸位安静，国王要演说了。”凯斯宾站起身来，心里有点儿紧张。“纳尼亚的臣民们！”他开始讲话了。可是当他刚要往下说时，兔子卡梅罗突然竖起耳朵，警觉地做了个手势“嘘！有人来了！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Bulgy Bears were very anxious to have the feast first and leave the council till afterwards: perhaps till tomorrow. Reepicheep and his Mice said that councils and feasts could both wait, and proposed storming Miraz in his own castle that very night. Pattertwig and the other Squirrels said they could talk and eat at the same time, so why not have the council and feast all at once? The Moles proposed throwing up entrenchments round the Lawn before they did anything else. The Fauns thought it would be better to begin with a solemn dance. The Old Raven, while agreeing with the Bears that it would take too long to have a full council before supper, begged to be allowed to give a brief address to the whole company. But Caspian and the Centaurs and the Dwarfs overruled all these suggestions and insisted on holding a real council of war at once.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大狗熊们最关心的是举行宴会，它们提出把政务会延迟一两天；雷佩契普和它的老鼠大军则建议暂缓举行盛宴和会议，当天夜里就直捣城堡，袭击弥若兹，打他个猝不及防；以佩蒂威格为首的松鼠们说，边吃边谈最省时间，为什么不能同时开始？鼹鼠们郑重提议先在跳舞场四周挖出一道防御壕沟，以防不测，然后再做其他事情；羊怪们认为最好先隆重地跳一次集体舞；老渡鸦却表示同意狗熊们的意见，说要把整个会议开完了再吃饭（忙乱中它把程序说反了！），同时它还请求允许它先向全体朋友简短致辞。可是凯斯宾、人头马和小矮人们不同意所有这些提议，坚持立即召开一次关于战争的会议。）">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"By your horse Destrier," said Doctor Cornelius. "The poor brute knew no better. When you were knocked off, of course, he went dawdling back to his stable in the castle. Then the secret of your flight was known. I made myself scarce, having no wish to be questioned about it in Miraz's torture chamber. I had a pretty good guess from my crystal as to where I should find you. But all day -- that was the day before yesterday -- I saw Miraz's tracking parties out in the woods. Yesterday I learned that his army is out. I don't think some of your -- um -- pure-blooded Dwarfs have as much woodcraft as might be expected. You've left tracks all over the place. Great carelessness. At any rate something has warned Miraz that Old Narnia is not so dead as he had hoped, and he is on the move."</div>

<div class="line_en">"It lies within the skirts of the Great Woods and it is a huge mound which Narnians raised in very ancient times over a very magical place, where there stood -- and perhaps still stands -- a very magical Stone. The Mound is all hollowed out within into galleries and caves, and the Stone is in the central cave of all. There is room in the mound for all our stores, and those of us who have most need of cover and are most accustomed to underground life can be lodged in the caves. The rest of us can lie in the wood. At a pinch all of us (except this worthy Giant) could retreat into the Mound itself, and there we should be beyond the reach of every danger except famine."</div>

<div class="line_en">It was certainly an awesome place, a round green hill on top of another hill, long since grown over with trees, and one little, low doorway leading into it. The tunnels inside were a perfect maze till you got to know them, and they were lined and roofed with smooth stones, and on the stones, peering in the twilight, Caspian saw strange characters and snaky patterns, and pictures in which the form of a Lion was repeated again and again. It all seemed to belong to an even older Narnia than the Narnia of which his nurse had told him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是个僻静的地方，一个馒头状的绿色土丘，坐落在小山顶上。在大树的浓荫下，有一条蜿蜒的小道，直通土丘的中心。堡垒里面结构复杂，对不熟悉它的人来说，简直是个迷宫。里面四壁全是用光滑的石头砌起来的。借着昏暗的光线，凯斯宾看到石壁上刻着一些奇形怪状的文字和蛇形花纹，还有许多有关狮子的图画。这一切都在向他表明那个古老而又神秘的纳尼亚确实存在着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was after they had taken up their quarters in and around the How that fortune began to turn against them. King Miraz's scouts soon found their new lair, and he and his army arrived on the edge of the woods. And as so often happens, the enemy turned out stronger than they had reckoned. Caspian's heart sank as he saw company after company arriving. And though Miraz's men may have been afraid of going into the wood, they were even more afraid of Miraz, and with him in command they carried battle deeply into it and sometimes almost to the How itself. Caspian and other captains of course made many sorties into the open country. Thus there was fighting on most days and sometimes by night as well; but Caspian's party had on the whole the worst of it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们在堡垒安顿了下来，没想到弥若兹的探子很快就发现了他们的踪迹。于是，大批军队跟踪而来。敌人的兵力比他们估计的要强得多，看到敌军一队接着一队开过来，凯斯宾的心直往下沉。尽管弥若兹的士兵惧怕这大森林，但他们更怕弥若兹的淫威。在他的指挥下，士兵们开进森林深处作战，有时甚至打到堡垒的大门前。凯斯宾和他的部将们也曾向平原发动了几次反攻，但被动挨打的时候较多。战斗多半是在白天，有时晚上也打。总的形势对凯斯宾一方很不利。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At last there came a night when everything had gone as badly as possible, and the rain which had been falling heavily all day had ceased at nightfall only to give place to raw cold. That morning Caspian had arranged what was his biggest battle yet, and all had hung their hopes on it. He, with most of the Dwarfs, was to have fallen on the King's right wing at daybreak, and then, when they were heavily engaged, Giant Wimbleweather, with the Centaurs and some of the fiercest beasts, was to have broken out from another place and endeavoured to cut the King's right off from the rest of the army. But it had all failed. No one had warned Caspian (because no one in these later days of Narnia remembered) that Giants are not at all clever. Poor Wimbleweather, though as brave as a lion, was a true Giant in that respect. He had broken out at the wrong time and from the wrong place, and both his party and Caspian's had suffered badly and done the enemy little harm. The best of the Bears had been hurt, a Centaur terribly wounded, and there were few in Caspian's party who had not lost blood. It was a gloomy company that huddled under the dripping trees to eat their scanty supper.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大雨下了整整一天，傍晚时分总算停了下来，但气温骤降，寒冷袭击着每一个人。次日清晨，凯斯宾部署了最猛烈的一次攻击，他把所有希望都寄托在这场战斗上了。他率领大部分小矮人在黎明时分扑向弥若兹的右翼，当右翼阵地上双方殊死拼杀的时候，巨人韦姆布威热、人头马和一部分最凶猛的动物从隐蔽的地方冲杀出来，奋力切断敌人的增援部队。可是这一仗又打败了。凯斯宾不知道巨人秉性憨厚，却并不聪明。尽管可怜的韦姆布威热像狮子一般勇猛（在这一点上他不愧是一个真正的巨人），可因为他进攻的时机、地点都不合适，结果使得他的队伍乃至凯斯宾的队伍都吃了败仗，而敌人却没有受到什么损失。最有战斗力的一只熊挂了彩，人头马伤势严重，凯斯宾的部下大多数都受了伤。战斗结束时已是黄昏时分，他们挤在大树下面，分食那少得可怜的晚餐。冰凉的雨水穿过浓密的树叶滴在身上。饥寒交迫的战士们一个个垂头丧气，士气低沉。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The gloomiest of all was Giant Wimbleweather. He knew it was all his fault. He sat in silence shedding big tears which collected on the end of his nose and then fell off with a huge splash on the whole bivouac of the Mice, who had just been beginning to get warm and drowsy. They all jumped up, shaking the water out of their ears and wringing their little blankets, and asked the Giant in shrill but forcible voices whether he thought they weren't wet enough without this sort of thing. And then other people woke up and told the Mice they had been enrolled as scouts and not as a concert party, and asked why they couldn't keep quiet. And Wimbleweather tiptoed away to find some place where he could be miserable in peace and stepped on somebody's tail and somebody (they said afterwards it was a fox) bit him. And so everyone was out of temper.</div>

<div class="line_en">But in the secret and magical chamber at the heart of the How, King Caspian, with Cornelius and the Badger and Nikabrik and Trumpkin, were at council. Thick pillars of ancient workmanship supported the roof. In the centre was the Stone itself -- a stone table, split right down the centre, and covered with what had once been writing of some kind: but ages of wind and rain and snow had almost worn them away in old times when the Stone Table had stood on the hilltop, and the Mound had not yet been built above it. They were not using the Table nor sitting round it: it was too magic a thing for any common use. They sat on logs a little way from it, and between them was a rough wooden table, on which stood a rude clay lamp lighting up their pale faces and throwing big shadows on the walls.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时，在堡垒中心那个最为隐蔽而又富有传奇色彩的洞穴里，国王凯斯宾、克奈尔斯、獾、尼克布瑞克和杜鲁普金正在开会。几根年代久远的大柱子支撑着洞穴的屋顶，屋子正中央摆着那块石头——一张石桌。石桌从中间断为两截，上面刻满了谁也不认识的文字。在那石桌被搬进洞穴之前，由于长年的风吹雨淋，上面的字迹都已模糊不清，难以辨认了。他们没有在那石桌旁开会，因为他们认为这张石桌是个神圣的物品，不可随便使用。他们坐在离石桌不远的木头上，围着一张粗糙的木制桌子，桌上放着一盏简陋的泥灯，灯光照着他们苍白的脸，并在墙壁上留下了他们长长的身影。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I think," went on the learned man, "that they -- or he will come back to one or other of the Ancient Places of Narnia. This, where we now sit, is the most ancient and most deeply magical of all, and here, I think, the answer is likeliest to come. But there are two others. One Lantern Waste, up-river, west of Beaversdam, where the Royal Children first appeared in Narnia, as the records tell The other is down at the river-mouth, where their castle of Cair Paravel once stood. And if Aslan himself comes, that would be the best place for meeting him too, for every story says that he is the son of the great Emperor-over-the-Sea, and over the sea he will pass. I should like very much to send messengers to both places, to Lantern Waste and the river-mouth, to receive them -- or him or it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我以为，”这位知识渊博的人继续说，“他们有可能先回到纳尼亚某个圣地，比如说，咱们脚下的这个地方便是其中之一，而且最富魔力。所以我想，那援助有可能会在这儿出现。可是还有其他两处地方。一个是灯柱野林，在河的上游，海狸大坝的西边。据传说，王室的孩子们就是从那儿来到纳尼亚国土上的。另一个圣地在下游，河的出口处，是当年王宫凯尔帕拉维尔城堡的所在地。假如阿斯兰亲自来，那是迎接他的最好地方。因为根据传说，他是伟大的海外皇帝，他将横渡大海而来。我提议向这两个地方——灯柱野林和河口——派出使臣去迎接我们的救星。”">查看中文翻译</div>
