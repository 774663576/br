<div class="line_en">The world has transformed to flame and smoke. Burning branches crack from trees and fall in showers of sparks at my feet. All I can do is follow the others, the rabbits and deer, and I even spot a wild dog pack shooting through the woods. I trust their sense of direction because their instincts are sharper than mine. But they are much faster, flying through the underbrush so gracefully as my boots catch on roots and fallen tree limbs, that there's no way I can keep apace with them.</div>

<div class="line_en">My first impulse is to scramble from the tree, but I'm belted in. Somehow my fumbling fingers release the buckle and I fall to the ground in a heap, still snarled in my sleeping bag. There's no time for any kind of packing. Fortunately, my backpack and water bottle are already in the bag. I shove in the belt, hoist the bag over my shoulder, and flee.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我的第一反应是赶快从树上下来，可我被腰带绑着。我在慌乱中把腰带扣解开，整个人连同睡袋一起跌落在地上。我从睡袋里爬出来，没时间整理了，还好，我的背包和水瓶都已装在睡袋里。我抓起腰带，把睡袋整个扛在肩上，拼命奔逃。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The heat is horrible, but worse than the heat is the smoke, which threatens to suffocate me at any moment. I pull the top of my shirt up over my nose, grateful to find it soaked in sweat, and it offers a thin veil of protection. And I run, choking, my bag banging against my back, my face cut with branches that materialize from the gray haze without warning, because I know I am supposed to run.</div>

<div class="line_en">This was no tribute's campfire gone out of control, no accidental occurrence. The flames that bear down on me have an unnatural height, a uniformity that marks them as human-made, machine-made, Gamemaker-made. Things have been too quiet today. No deaths, perhaps no fights at all. The audience in the Capitol will be getting bored, claiming that these Games are verging on dullness. This is the one thing the Games must not do.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这一定不是“贡品”失控的营火，也非偶然失火。从我的头上掉落下来的火焰那么高，是非自然的，火势分布均匀像是人为的——机器所为或大赛组织者所为。今天的一切太安静了，没人死亡，也许连厮杀都不曾出现，凯匹特的观众会感觉厌倦，抱怨比赛没意思，而这是饥饿游戏所不允许出现的情况。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It's not hard to follow the Gamemakers' motivation. There is the Career pack and then there are the rest of us, probably spread far and thin across the arena. This fire is designed to flush us out, to drive us together. It may not be the most original device I've seen, but it's very, very effective.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="揣度大赛组织者的意图并不难。比赛一方是职业选手一伙，另一方是我们，也许已经在竞技场散开，彼此离得过远，这场火是为了把我们惊走，让所有的人靠近。这也许不是我见过的最佳创意，但它却非常、非常有效。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I hurdle over a burning log. Not high enough. The tail end of my jacket catches on fire and I have to stop to rip it from my body and stamp out the flames. But I don't dare leave the jacket, scorched and smoldering as it is, I take the risk of shoving it in my sleeping bag, hoping the lack of air will quell what I haven't extinguished. This is all I have, what I carry on my back, and it's little enough to survive with.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我跳过一截燃烧的木头时，跳得不够高，夹克后边着了火。我不得不停下，把它脱下，用脚把火苗踩灭。可我还不敢扔掉夹克，尽管四周火势汹汹、氧气稀薄，我还是冒险把它塞在睡袋里，希望睡袋里氧气缺乏会把我不曾熄灭的余烬弄灭。我背在身后的是我所拥有的一切，即使如此，这少得可怜的东西也不足以维持我的生存。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I know I need to keep moving, but I'm trembling and light-headed now, gasping for air. I allow myself about a spoonful of water to rinse my mouth and spit then take a few swallows from my bottle. You get one minute, I tell myself. One minute to rest. I take the time to reorder my supplies, wad up the sleeping bag, and messily stuff everything into the backpack. My minute's up. I know it's time to move on, but the smoke has clouded my thoughts. The swift-footed animals that were my compass have left me behind. I know I haven't been in this part of the woods before, there were no sizable rocks like the one I'm sheltering against on my earlier travels. Where are the Gamemakers driving me? Back to the lake? To a whole new terrain filled with new dangers? I had just found a few hours of peace at the pond when this attack began. Would there be any way I could travel parallel to the fire and work my way back there, to a source of water at least? The wall of fire must have an end and it won't burn indefinitely. Not because the Gamemakers couldn't keep it fueled but because, again, that would invite accusations of boredom from the audience. If I could get back behind the fire line, I could avoid meeting up with the Careers. I've just decided to try and loop back around, although it will require miles of travel away from the inferno and then a very circuitous route back, when the first fireball blasts into the rock about two feet from my head. I spring out from under my ledge, energized by renewed fear.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我心里明白我必须继续走，可此时我浑身颤抖、头重脚轻、呼吸困难。我喝了一口水，漱了漱口，接着又喝了几大口水。“你只能休息一分钟，一分钟。”我对自己说。我赶紧把东西整理一下，卷起睡袋，把其他东西胡乱地往背包里一塞。时间到了，我要继续走，可我被烟熏得思路不清，那些腿脚灵活、为我做向导的动物早已跑得无影无踪。我以前没来过这块地方，因为我没见过此时我躲藏其下的大块岩石。大赛组织者究竟要把我赶到哪儿？赶到湖边？还是赶到危机四伏的另一个地方？我在池塘边刚得到一点安歇就遭此袭击。是否有一条和火势走向平行的路线可以使我返回湖边，或者至少找到一处水源？火焰不可能无止境地燃烧，它终有边际。并不是大赛组织者没有足够的火源，而是观众同样会抱怨无聊。如果我在远离火焰的背后的路线行走，也许会避开职业选手。正当我决计绕开火源，采用迂回路线，穿行数英里向回折返时，第一个巨大的火球在距离我头顶两英尺的岩石旁爆炸。我从岩石下跳出来，内心充满新的恐惧。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In a matter of minutes, my throat and nose are burning. The coughing begins soon after and my lungs begin to feel as if they are actually being cooked. Discomfort turns to distress until each breath sends a searing pain through my chest. I manage to take cover under a stone outcropping just as the vomiting begins, and I lose my meager supper and whatever water has remained in my stomach. Crouching on my hands and knees, I retch until there's nothing left to come up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="只过了几分钟，我的口鼻已焦燥无比。我不住地咳嗽，肺部觉得已经快烤熟了。不舒服继而变成痛苦，最后伴着每次呼吸胸部都剧烈刺痛。随后我躲在一块突出的岩石下面，手脚着地，开始呕吐，我把少得可怜的晚饭和水一股脑地吐了出来，直到胃里的食物一丝不剩。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Whatever vague plan I had conceived regarding returning to my pond is wiped from my mind as I zigzag and dive and leap to avoid the fireballs. Each one is only the size of an apple, but packs tremendous power on contact. Every sense I have goes into overdrive as the need to survive takes over. There's no time to judge if a move is the correct one. When there's a hiss, I act or die.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="刚才在脑中匆忙形成的返回池塘的计划，此时在我左冲右突、躲闪腾挪的奔逃中给打得烟消云散。每个火弹只有苹果大小，但一旦接触物体却释放出巨大能量。死亡迫近，对生存的强烈渴求，使我所有的感官都超速运转。没有时间判断往哪跑是正确的，当嘶嘶声响起时，我要么闪开，要么死掉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The game has taken a twist. The fire was just to get us moving, now the audience will get to see some real fun. When I hear the next hiss, I flatten on the ground, not taking time to look. The fireball hits a tree off to my left, engulfing it in flames. To remain still is death. I'm barely on my feet before the third ball hits the ground where I was lying, sending a pillar of fire up behind me. Time loses meaning now as I frantically try to dodge the attacks. I can't see where they're being launched from, but it's not a hovercraft. The angles are not extreme enough. Probably this whole segment of the woods has been armed with precision launchers that are concealed in trees or rocks. Somewhere, in a cool and spotless room, a Gamemaker sits at a set of controls, fingers on the triggers that could end my life in a second. All that is needed is a direct hit.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在饥饿游戏出现了意想不到的转折。这场火就是为了让我们继续移动，而此时的观众可以饶有兴味地观看比赛了。当我再次听到嘶嘶的响声时，赶陕趴在地上，根本来不及看。火球击中了我身旁的一棵树，树立刻被火舌吞噬。待着不动就是等死，我起身就跑，脚跟还没有站稳就听到第三颗火球在我刚才卧倒的地方爆炸，在身后形成了一个火柱。我在慌忙躲避火球时，时间失去了其固有的意义。我看不出火球是从哪里发射的，但从发射角度上判断不是从直升机上，也许整个这片丛林都处于火球的精确攻击目标之中，发射台就隐藏在树林里的岩石中，而大赛组织者此时正坐在凉爽洁净的室内，揿动瞬间就可以要了我命的按钮，他们所需的一切就是向下一按。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">How long I scramble along dodging the fireballs I can't say, but the attacks finally begin to abate. Which is good, because I'm retching again. This time it's an acidic substance that scalds my throat and makes its way into my nose as well. I'm forced to stop as my body convulses, trying desperately to rid itself of the poisons I've been sucking in during the attack. I wait for the next hiss, the next signal to bolt. It doesn't come. The force of the retching has squeezed tears out of my stinging eyes. My clothes are drenched in sweat. Somehow, through the smoke and vomit, I pick up the scent of singed hair. My hand fumbles to my braid and finds a fireball has seared off at least six inches of it. Strands of blackened hair crumble in my fingers. I stare at them, fascinated by the transformation, when the hissing registers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我用了多长时间在匆忙慌乱中躲避火球，不得而知，但攻击终于逐渐减弱。很好。我又开始恶心。这次是一股股的酸水直往嗓子眼和鼻子里涌，我不得不停下来，我的身体在抽搐，它拼命要把刚才吸入的毒气倒出去。我等着另一个奔跑的信号——火球的嘶嘶声，但没有声音。剧烈的呕吐把眼泪从我刺痛的眼中挤出来，衣服也已被汗水浸透了。鼻子里满是烟味和反酸味，但我仍闻到烧焦头发的味道。我用手摸摸辫子，发现火球已经把它烧焦了至少六英寸，一缕缕的烧焦的头发应手而落。我看着头发，惊异于它的变化。这时又传来了嘶嘶的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Something keeps me moving forward, though. A lifetime of watching the Hunger Games lets me know that certain areas of the arena are rigged for certain attacks. And that if I can just get away from this section, I might be able to move out of reach of the launchers. I might also then fall straight into a pit of vipers, but I can't worry about that now.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不管怎么说，火球确实迫使我向前移动。多年观看饥饿游戏，经验告诉我有些区域是受到非法操纵的，以对选手实施攻击。只要我能逃出这一区域，就能逃出发射者的掌控，也许我会直接闯入蛇穴，但现在已无法顾及其他了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">My muscles react, only not fast enough this time. The fireball crashes into the ground at my side, but not before it skids across my right calf. Seeing my pants leg on fire sends me over the edge. I twist and scuttle backward on my hands and feet, shrieking, trying to remove myself from the horror. When I finally regain enough sense, I roll the leg back and forth on the ground, which stifles the worst of it. But then, without thinking, I rip away the remaining fabric with my bare hands.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我赶快跑开，但不够快，火球划过我右侧小腿，打在我身旁的地上。看到裤子起了火，我一下子慌了神，我一边尖叫，一边手脚着地，扭着身子向后退，想逃离这恐怖的一切。后来我稍稍定下神，腿在地上来回滚动，把最旺的火苗扑灭，接着，未假思索，我把剩下还在燃烧的裤子布用手撕下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I hear Cinna's voice, carrying images of rich fabric and sparkling gems. "Katniss, the girl who was on fire." What a good laugh the Gamemakers must be having over that one. Perhaps, Cinna's beautiful costumes have even brought on this particular torture for me. I know he couldn't have foreseen this, must be hurting for me because, in fact, I believe he cares about me. But all in all, maybe showing up stark naked in that chariot would have been safer for me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此时我仿佛看到西纳手拿闪着珠光的艳丽服装，他的声音传来，“凯特尼斯，燃烧的女孩。”大赛组织者听到这话一定笑掉了大牙。也许，正是西纳的绚丽服装给我带来了这场灾难。我心里清楚对此他是不可能提前预知的，他现在也一定在为我难过，因为我知道他真心关心我。不管怎样，如果我当时一丝不挂出现在战车上，现在的处境兴许还会安全些。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The attack is now over. The Gamemakers don't want me dead. Not yet anyway. Everyone knows they could destroy us all within seconds of the opening gong. The real sport of the Hunger Games is watching the tributes kill one another. Every so often, they do kill a tribute just to remind the players they can. But mostly, they manipulate us into confronting one another face-to-face. Which means, if I am no longer being fired at, there is at least one other tribute close at hand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="袭击结束了。大赛组织者也并不想让我死，至少现在还不想。饥饿游戏的核心在于“贡品”互相残杀。常常，他们会杀死一个“贡品”，以提醒其他选手他们也能杀人。但多数情况下，他们会驱使选手面对彼此，也就是说，如果我没有被烧死，那就会有另一个“贡品”出现在附近。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I would drag myself into a tree and take cover now if I could, but the smoke is still thick enough to kill me. I make myself stand and begin to limp away from the wall of flames that lights up the sky. It does not seem to be pursuing me any longer, except with its stinking black clouds.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果可能，我现在很想跑到树林里躲起来，可林子里的浓烟仍使人窒息。我站起身来，一瘸一拐地向远处走，离开红透天边的火焰。火舌似乎没有再对我紧逼不合，不过天空仍浓烟密布。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Another light, daylight, begins to softly emerge. Swirls of smoke catch the sunbeams. My visibility is poor. I can see maybe fifteen yards in any direction. A tribute could easily be concealed from me here. I should draw my knife as a precaution, but I doubt my ability to hold it for long. The pain in my hands can in no way compete with that in my calf. I hate burns, have always hated them, even a small one gotten from pulling a pan of bread from the oven. It is the worst kind of pain to me, but I have never experienced anything like this.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="渐渐地，东方出现了柔和的晨光，盘旋上升的浓烟遮蔽了日光。视线很差，我只能看到前面五十码的距离。一个“贡品”很容易躲过我的视线，我应该把刀拿出来，以备不测，可我怀疑手拿着刀能坚持多久。我的手很疼，但小腿的疼痛却远甚于此。我讨厌烫伤，即使被烤面包的平底锅烫伤也令我恼火。对我来说，这是世上最难以忍受的疼痛，但我以前却从未遭受如此剧烈的疼痛。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I bathe the blood and ash from my face. I try to recall all I know about burns. They are common injuries in the Seam where we cook and heat our homes with coal. Then there are the mine accidents… A family once brought in an unconscious young man pleading with my mother to help him. The district doctor who's responsible for treating the miners had written him off, told the family to take him home to die. But they wouldn't accept this. He lay on our kitchen table, senseless to the world. I got a glimpse of the wound on his thigh, gaping, charred flesh, burned clear down to the bone, before I ran from the house. I went to the woods and hunted the entire day, haunted by the gruesome leg, memories of my father's death. What's funny was, Prim, who's scared of her own shadow, stayed and helped. My mother says healers are born, not made. They did their best, but the man died, just like the doctor said he would.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我把身上的血迹和脸上的灰尘洗掉，试图回忆起我对烧伤的所有常识。在十二区烧伤和烫伤很平常，因为我们用煤烧饭、取暖。还有煤矿事故…有一次，一家人把一个失去知觉的青年抬到家里请求妈妈医治。负责给矿工治病的社区医生已经说他没救了，让他回家等死。可他家人不愿意接受这个事实。他躺在我家厨房的桌子上，完全没有了意识。我看了一眼他大腿上的烧伤，皮肤烧得血肉模糊，像鱼皮一样，骨头都露了出来，我赶紧从屋子里跑了出去。我在林子里打了一天猎，时不时地想起那伤口，还有爸爸的死。有意思的是波丽姆，一个连自己的影子都怕的人，却留下来帮着妈妈。妈妈说要伤口好只能靠自己长出新肉，而不是靠药物。他们已尽了全力，可那人还是死了，正如那医生所说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I'm so weary I don't even notice I'm in the pool until I'm ankle-deep. It's spring-fed, bubbling up out of a crevice in some rocks, and blissfully cool. I plunge my hands into the shallow water and feel instant relief. Isn't that what my mother always says? The first treatment for a burn is cold water? That it draws out the heat? But she means minor burns. Probably she'd recommend it for my hands. But what of my calf? Although I have not yet had the courage to examine it, I'm guessing that it's an injury in a whole different class.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我已疲惫不堪，以至于自己走到了池塘，水漫过脚踝都没注意到。这是由一汪泉水形成的湖泊，水泡从水里的岩石缝隙咕嘟嘟地冒出来，池水是那么凉爽怡人。我把手浸在浅浅的水中，立刻感到轻松了许多。这难道不就是妈妈常说起的方法吗？对烫伤最及时的治疗方法是泡在凉水里吗？凉水会吸出热量吗？但她说的是小烫伤，也许她会用这个方法治疗我的手，但我的腿呢？尽管我还没勇气去检查伤势，但我肯定这是完全不同的一种伤。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Pity does not get you aid. Admiration at your refusal to give in does. I cut the remains of the pant leg off at the knee and examine the injury more closely. The burned area is about the size of my hand. None of the skin is blackened. I think it's not too bad to soak. Gingerly I stretch out my leg into the pool, propping the heel of my boot on a rock so the leather doesn't get too sodden, and sigh, because this does offer some relief. I know there are herbs, if I could find them, that would speed the healing, but I can't quite call them to mind. Water and time will probably be all I have to work with.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可怜的处境不会带来救助，但坚韧不屈却能够博得人们的尊敬。我从膝盖一下把裤子割掉，仔细观察伤口。烧伤的部分有我的巴掌那么大，皮肤没有烧焦。我想把它泡在水里应该还可以。于是我把腿小心翼翼地伸向水里，把靴子靠在岩石上免得它湿透了。我舒了口气，伤口浸在水里确实舒服多了。我认识一些草药，如果能找到，可以加速伤口的愈合，可我有点想不起来了。凉爽的水，加上时间也许能帮助我回忆起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Despite the pain, drowsiness begins to take over. I'd take to a tree and try to rest, except I'd be too easy to spot. Besides, abandoning my pool seems impossible. I neatly arrange my supplies, even settle my pack on my shoulders, but I can't seem to leave. I spot some water plants with edible roots and make a small meal with my last piece of rabbit. Sip water.

<div class="line_cn" title="尽管很痛，可我还是感到很困。我得到树林里找地方休息一下，只不过白天休息很容易被人发现。另外，离开池塘简直是不可能的。我已把东西理好，甚至把背包背在了肩上，可我好像无法离开。我看到有些水生植物的根能吃，所以准备就着兔肉简单吃点。我小口喝着水，看着太阳在东方划出玫瑰色的弧线。我应该朝哪个方向走会比这里安全些？我靠在背包上，困倦再次向我袭来。“要是职业选手想找我，那就让他们来吧。”在坠入睡梦前，我想，“让他们来吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">My hands are slightly less demanding. They can handle small breaks from the pool. So I slowly put my gear back in order. First I fill my bottle with the pool water, treat it, and when enough time has passed, begin to rehydrate my body. After a time, I force myself to nibble on a cracker, which helps settle my stomach. I roll up my sleeping bag. Except for a few black marks, it's relatively unscathed. My jacket's another matter. Stinking and scorched, at least a foot of the back beyond repair. I cut off the damaged area leaving me with a garment that comes just to the bottom of my ribs. But the hood's intact and it's far better than nothing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="手上伤势好些了，可以短时间从水里拿出来。所以我慢慢地把供给品备好。先在瓶子里灌满水，消好毒，再给自己的身体补水。过了一会儿，我强迫自己一点点地啃饼干，这样我就解决了肚子的问题。接着我把睡袋卷起来。睡袋上除了有几个黑点，几乎没有损坏。我的夹克就是另外一回事了，它发出焦煳的臭味，后背至少有一英尺长已经烧坏，我把破的地方割掉，夹克长度正好到我的两肋。兜帽还没坏，总比什么也没有强。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Should I be moving on? The smoke is slowly clearing but still too heavy to be healthy. If I do continue away from the fire, won't I be walking straight into the weapons of the Careers? Besides, every time I lift my leg from the water, the pain rebounds so intensely I have to slide it back in.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我还要继续朝前走吗？烟雾渐渐散去，可还是太浓，无法呼吸。如果我朝远离火源的方向前行，是否会与职业选手狭路相逢？另外，每次我把腿从水里拿出来，就会像先前一样剧痛，我又赶快把它放回去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Still, they are closing in, just like a pack of wild dogs, and so I do what I have done my whole life in such circumstances. I pick a high tree and begin to climb. If running hurt, climbing is agonizing because it requires not only exertion but direct contact of my hands on the tree bark. I'm fast, though, and by the time they've reached the base of my trunk, I'm twenty feet up. For a moment, we stop and survey one another. I hope they can't hear the pounding of my heart.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们在一步步逼近，就像一群野狗。情势危急，于是我采取了以前遇到同样情况时的应对办法，我找到一棵很高的大树爬了上去。刚才的奔跑使我的伤口剧痛，爬树更是疼痛难忍，因为爬树不仅费力，手也要接触树皮。可我仍快速向上爬去。待他们追到树下时，我已爬了二十英尺高。我们都停下一会儿，来观察彼此的动静，我希望他们不要听到我的心跳声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This could be it, I think. What chance do I have against them? All six are there, the five Careers and Peeta, and my only consolation is they're pretty beat-up, too. Even so, look at their weapons. Look at their faces, grinning and snarling at me, a sure kill above them. It seems pretty hopeless. But then something else registers. They're bigger and stronger than I am, no doubt, but they're also heavier. There's a reason it's me and not Gale who ventures up to pluck the highest fruit, or rob the most remote bird nests. I must weigh at least fifty or sixty pounds less than the smallest Career.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“也许，我们面对面交锋就在此刻吧。”我想，与他们相比，我能有多少获胜的机会？他们共六个人，五个职业选手还有皮塔，我唯一的安慰是他们也很疲惫。可是，看看他们的武器，令人胆寒，再看看他们的脸——正一脸狞笑地看着我，他们杀我如探囊取物。眼下的情势似乎很绝望，可我灵机一动，想到他们比我高大、强壮，是没错，可他们的身体也比我重啊。以前爬到最高的树上去摘果子或掏鸟窝的总是我而不是盖尔，这有其道理。可现在，最小个的职业选手也比我重五六十磅。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And find me, they do. It's lucky I'm ready to move on because when I hear the feet, I have less than a minute head start. Evening has begun to fall. The moment I awake, I'm up and running, splashing across the pool, flying into the underbrush. My leg slows me down, but I sense my pursuers are not as speedy as they were before the fire, either. I hear their coughs, their raspy voices calling to one another.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们真的找到了我。幸运的是，他们到来时，我已经离开了，他们离我仅有一分钟的距离。天也渐渐黑了，听到脚步声，我快跑起来，穿过水塘，向林中奔去。腿伤减慢了我奔跑的速度，可我感觉追我的人也不像火灾前那么步履矫健了。他们边咳嗽边粗暴地喊叫着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I give Cato time to hoist himself into the tree before I begin to climb again. Gale always says I remind him of a squirrel the way I can scurry up even the slenderest limbs. Part of it's my weight, but part of it's practice. You have to know where to place your hands and feet. I'm another thirty feet in the air when I hear the crack and look down to see Cato flailing as he and a branch go down. He hits the ground hard and I'm hoping he possibly broke his neck when he gets back to his feet, swearing like a fiend.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我故意给加图留出爬树的时间，然后我才开始爬。盖尔总是说每次看到我爬最细的树枝他就会想起松鼠。一方面是因为我体重轻，另一方面是我练得多。爬树时你要知道把手脚放在哪儿。我又向上爬了三十英尺，这时我听到树枝的断裂声。我向下一看，加图连同一个树枝一起掉了下去。他重重地摔在地上，我正希望他摔断了脖，可他却站了起来，像个邪魔似的口中不住地咒骂着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Here, take this, Cato," says the girl from District 1, and she offers him the silver bow and sheath of arrows. My bow! My arrows! Just the sight of them makes me so angry I want to scream, at myself, at that traitor Peeta for distracting me from having them. I try to make eye contact with him now, but he seems to be intentionally avoiding my gaze as he polishes his knife with the edge of his shirt.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“喏，加图，拿着这个。”一区的女孩说。她把银色的弓和箭袋递给他。我的弓！我的箭！只是看到这些我就很生气。我想对自己大喊，对皮塔这个当时让我分神的叛徒大喊。我直盯他的眼睛，可他却正用衣袖擦刀子，好像有意避开我的目光。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Careers regroup on the ground and I can hear them growling conspiratorially among themselves, furious I have made them look foolish. But twilight has arrived and their window of attack on me is closing. Finally, I hear Peeta say harshly, "Oh, let her stay up there. It's not like she's going anywhere. We'll deal with her in the morning."</div>

One of the arrows gets lodged in the tree near me though and I'm able to seize it. I wave it teasingly above her head, as if this was the sole purpose of retrieving it, when actually I mean to use it if I ever get the chance.

<div class="line_en">All my bravado is gone. I'm weak from pain and hunger but can't bring myself to eat. Even if I can last the night, what will the morning bring? I stare into the foliage trying to will myself to rest, but the burns forbid it. Birds are settling down for the night, singing lullabies to their young. Night creatures emerge. An owl hoots. The faint scent of a skunk cuts through the smoke. The eyes of some animal peer at me from the neighboring tree -- a possum maybe -- catching the firelight from the Careers' torches. Suddenly, I'm up on one elbow. Those are no possum's eyes, I know their glassy reflection too well. In fact, those are not animal eyes at all. In the last dim rays of light, I make her out, watching me silently from between the branches. Rue.</div>

I cut a slash in the fabric and hang my calf out in the open air. I drizzle water on the wound, my hands.</div>
