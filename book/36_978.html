<div class="line_en">She was now one of a group of oriental beauties who, in the second act of the comic opera, were paraded by the vizier before the new potentate as the treasures of his harem. There was no word assigned to any of them, but on the evening when Hurstwood was housing himself in the loft of the street-car barn, the leading comedian and star, feeling exceedingly facetious, said in a profound voice, which created a ripple of laughter: "Well, who are you?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她这时在扮演一群东方美女中的一个。在这出喜歌剧的第二幕中，宫廷大臣让这群美女列队从新登基的国王面前走过，炫耀他的这群后宫宝贝。她们中谁都没被指定有台词，但是在赫斯渥睡在电车场的阁楼上的那天晚上，那个演主角的喜剧明星想玩个噱头，就声音洪亮地说：“喂，你是谁呀？”引起了一阵笑声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Those who look upon Hurstwood's Brooklyn venture as an error of judgment will none the less realise the negative influence on him of the fact that he had tried and failed. Carrie got a wrong idea of it. He said so little that she imagined he had encountered nothing worse than the ordinary roughness -- quitting so soon in the face of this seemed trifling. He did not want to work.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，那些认为赫斯渥的布鲁克林之行是个判断错误的人，也将意识到他尝试过并且失败了的事实在他身上产生的消极影响。对这件事情，嘉莉得出了错误的看法。他谈得很少，她还以为他遇到的只不过是些一般的粗暴行为。遇到这种情况，这么快就不干了，真是没意思。他就是不想工作。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It merely happened to be Carrie who was courtesying before him. It might as well have been any of the others, so far as he was concerned. He expected no answer and a dull one would have been reproved. But Carrie, whose experience and belief in herself gave her daring, courtesied sweetly again and answered: "I am yours truly."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="只是碰巧这时是嘉莉在他面前行礼。就他而言，原本随便对谁都是一样的。他并不指望听到回答，而且如果回答得笨拙是要挨骂的。但是，嘉莉的经验和自信给了她胆量，她又甜甜地行了个礼，回答说：“我是你忠实的姬妾。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was no gainsaying the value of this. Everybody in the company realised that she had got a start. Carrie hugged herself when next evening the lines got the same applause. She went home rejoicing, knowing that soon something must come of it. It was Hurstwood who, by his presence, caused her merry thoughts to flee and replaced them with sharp longings for an end of distress.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这件事的重要性是无可置疑的。剧团里人人都意识到她已经开始崭露头角了。第二天晚上，这句台词又博得了喝彩，嘉莉暗自感到庆幸。她回家时非常高兴，知道这事肯定很快就会有好的结果。可是，见到赫斯渥在家，她的那些愉快的想法就被赶跑了。取而代之的是要结束这种痛苦局面的强烈愿望。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Next week came, but Carrie saw no change. Hurstwood seemed more apathetic than ever. He saw her off mornings to rehearsals and the like with the utmost calm. He read and read. Several times he found himself staring at an item, but thinking of something else. The first of these lapses that he sharply noticed concerned a hilarious party he had once attended at a driving club, of which he had been a member. He sat, gazing downward, and gradually thought he heard the old voices and the clink of glasses.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="下一个星期到了，但是嘉莉没见赫斯渥有什么变化。他似乎比以前更显得麻木不仁。他看着嘉莉每天早晨出去参加排练之类的事，冷静到了极点。他只是看报，看报。有几次他发现自己眼睛盯着一则新闻，脑子里却在想着别的事情。他第一次明显地感到这样走神时，他正在回想他曾在骑马俱乐部里参加过的一次狂欢舞会，他当时曾是这个俱乐部的会员。他坐在那里，低着头，渐渐地以为自己听到了往日的人声和碰杯声。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">All at once he looked up. The room was so still it seemed ghostlike. He heard the clock ticking audibly and half suspected that he had been dozing. The paper was so straight in his hands, however, and the items he had been reading so directly before him, that he rid himself of the doze idea. Still, it seemed peculiar. When it occurred a second time, however, it did not seem quite so strange.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然他抬头一看，屋里寂静得像是有幽灵一般。他听到时钟清楚的滴嗒声，有些怀疑刚才自己是在打瞌睡。可是，报纸还是笔直地在他手里竖着，刚才看的新闻就在他眼前，于是他打消了认为自己刚才是在打瞌睡的想法。可这事还是很奇怪。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Carrie's little soldier friend, Miss Osborne, seeing her succeeding, had become a sort of satellite. Little Osborne could never of herself amount to anything.

<div class="line_en">Timid as Carrie was, she was strong in capability. The reliance of others made her feel as if she must, and when she must she dared. Experience of the world and of necessity was in her favour. No longer the lightest word of a man made her head dizzy. She had learned that men could change and fail. Flattery in its most palpable form had lost its force with her. It required superiority -- kindly superiority -- to move her -- the superiority of a genius like Ames.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="嘉莉虽然胆子很小，但是能力很强。别人对她的信赖使她自己也觉得仿佛一定会红起来，既然她一定会红，她也就胆大了起来。她已经老于世故并经历过贫困，这些都对她有利。她不再会被男人一句无足轻重的话弄得头脑发昏。她已经明白男人也会变化，也会失败。露骨的奉承对她已经失去了作用。要想打动她，得有高人一等的优势——善意的优势——像艾姆斯那样的天才的优势。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They decided to move Friday, which was two days away. Now that the thing was settled, Carrie's heart misgave her. She felt very much like a criminal in the matter.

<div class="line_en">She looked at him the same evening she had made up her mind to go, and now he seemed not so shiftless and worthless, but run down and beaten upon by chance.

<div class="line_en">To say truly, this would have been Carrie's attitude in any case. She had looked back at times upon her parting from Drouet and had regretted that she had served him so badly. She hoped she would never meet him again, but she was ashamed of her conduct. Not that she had any choice in the final separation. She had gone willingly to seek him, with sympathy in her heart, when Hurstwood had reported him ill. There was something cruel somewhere, and not being able to track it mentally to its logical lair, she concluded with feeling that he would never understand what Hurstwood had done and would see hard-hearted decision in her deed; hence her shame. Not that she cared for him. She did not want to make any one who had been good to her feel badly.</div>
