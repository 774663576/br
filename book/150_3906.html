<div class="line_en">She was driven now to appeal to his compassion. She ought to have told him at once. When he knew the horrible alternative that was placed before her his generosity, his sense of justice, his manliness, would be so vehemently aroused that he would think of nothing but her danger. Oh, how passionately she desired to feel his dear, protecting arms around her!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她寄望于激起他的怜悯之心了。这番话她其实早就应该给他坦白。在她刚把她面临的生死抉择告诉他时，她就该把这个杀手锏抛出来。这样他的宽宏大量，他的正义感，他的男子气概必然全都被激发出来，准会深明大义地先为她的危险处境着想。呃，现在她是多么渴望他甜蜜而有力的臂膀啊！">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh, I see." Townsend's tone changed ever so slightly. "I think that's rather decent of him, don't you?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"But me, Charlie?" she cried, with anguish in her voice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“但是我怎么办？查理？”她痛不欲生地叫道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, damn it all, that's rather an exaggeration. He would hardly take you if he thought that. It's no more risk for you than for him. In point of fact there's no great risk if you're careful. I've been here when there's been cholera and I haven't turned a hair. The great thing is not to eat anything uncooked, no raw fruit or salads, or anything like that, and see that your drinking water is boiled." He was gaining confidence as he proceeded, and his speech was fluent; he was even becoming less sullen and more alert; he was almost breezy. "After all, it's his job, isn't it? He's interested in bugs. It's rather a chance for him if you come to think of it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“呃，没有的事儿，纯粹是夸大其词。要真是这样，他不会忍心带你去的。你所受的危险不会比他大。现实点儿说，你只要处处加点小心，一定会平安无事。我刚到香港那会儿，这儿不也正闹霍乱吗？结果我连一根头发也没伤着。关键是千万不要吃没煮熟的东西，别碰不干净的水果和沙拉，其他的也是一样。还有注意一定要喝开水。”他越说劲头越足，滔滔不绝地没完没了。阴沉消散了，变成了专心致志，后来以至于心胸通畅，轻松愉快了。“毕竟这是他的本分工作，不是吗？他的兴趣就在那些虫子上。你替他想一想，这对他来说是个千载难逢的机会哩。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“但是我呢，查理？”她重复了一次，声音不再是痛苦，而是惊诧不已。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I think it's rather hard on me to put it like that. As far as I can make out your husband is behaving very generously. He's willing to forgive you if you'll let him. He wants to get you away and this opportunity has presented itself to take you to some place where for a few months you'll be out of harm's way. I don't pretend that Mei-Tan-Fun is a health resort, I never knew a Chinese city that was, but, there's no reason to get the wind up about it. In fact that's the worst thing you can do. I believe as many people die from sheer fright in an epidemic as because they get infected."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我认为对我下此评论是言过苛刻的。就我的理解，你的丈夫已经做出了英勇而慷慨的表率。他已经决意原谅你，如果你给他这个机会的话。他会带你走，而这个机会将是在数个月内，你不再是那个无人照看的淘气小鬼。我不必夸大其词说湄潭府是一处疗养胜地，我所去过的中国城市没有一个能够享此雅号。但是你不能因此就对它心生恐惧。事实上，你这样反而是犯了最大的错误。我相信，在一场瘟疫中，因为恐惧而死去的人不比因为疾病死去的人少。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But don't you see it'll kill me? Don't you know that he's taking me there because he knows it'll kill me?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“但是你不明白那会杀了我吗？你没看出他带我去是因为他本来就知道我去了就是死吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, the best way to understand a man is to put yourself in his shoes. From his point of view you've been rather a naughty little thing and he wants to get you out of harm's way. I always thought he never wanted to divorce you, he doesn't strike me as that sort of chap; but he made what he thought was a very generous offer and you put his back up by turning it down. I don't want to blame you, but really for all our sakes I think you ought to have given it a little consideration."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嗯，要想理解一个男人的想法，最好的办法是设身处地从他的角度考虑。在他看来，你就像一个到处淘气的小鬼头，他现在要把你带回到安全的地方去。我一直认为他无意离婚，他从来没有留给我那种印象。但是他做出了宽宏大度的决定，而你拒绝接受，这必定让他感到失望。我不是想责怪你，但是看在我们大家的分上，你应该再把这事儿考虑考虑。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, my dear, don't talk like that. We're in a damned awkward position and really it's no time to be melodramatic."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“呃，亲爱的，别说傻话了。我们现在的处境是相当棘手的，不是无中生有、乱发感慨的时候。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You've made up your mind not to understand." Oh, the pain in her heart, and the fear! She could have screamed. "You can't send me to certain death. If you have no love or pity for me you must have just ordinary human feeling."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你根本就没有打算这样想过。”她的心阵阵作痛。痛苦加上对死的恐惧，几乎让她尖叫起来。“你不能眼看着叫我去送死。即使你不爱我，你也不可怜我，可你总应该有一个正常人的感受吧？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She rocked to and fro in an agony. He did not speak, and once more his face wore that sullen look which till lately she had never known. Kitty was not crying now. She was dry-eyed, calm, and though her voice was low it was steady.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她痛苦地犹疑不定。他不再说话，脸色又一次阴沉了下来，直到现在凯蒂才明白那张脸是因何阴沉。凯蒂不再哭了。她的眼泪已经哭干了，心情变得异常地平静。她的声音虽然很低，但是语调坚定平稳。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She was silent. Vaguely, as when you are studying a foreign language and read a page which at first you can make nothing of, till a word or a sentence gives you a clue; and on a sudden a suspicion, as it were, of the sense flashes across your troubled wits, vaguely she gained an inkling into the workings of Walter's mind. It was like a dark and ominous landscape seen by a flash of lightning and in a moment hidden again by the night. She shuddered at what she saw.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她沉默了下来。她模糊地意识到了什么。这就像在学习某种外国话的时候，读完了一页文章你却根本不知所云；直到一个单词或者一个句子启发了你，使你冥思苦想的脑瓜灵光一现，似乎明白了整篇文章的意思。她模糊地领悟到了瓦尔特的阴谋——如同夜里一片黑暗阴霾的景物，被一道闪电照亮，继而又重新回复到黑暗当中。她被她在那一瞬看到的东西吓得全身发抖。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She looked at him coolly. "He knew that you'd let me down."</div>

<div class="line_en">Charlie looked down at the sheet of blotting paper in front of him. He was frowning a little and his mouth was sulky. But he did not reply.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="查理低头瞅向了桌上铺的一张吸墨纸。他的眉头微微皱了起来，嘴唇紧紧地闭拢着，什么话也没说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He made that threat only because he knew that you'd crumple up at it, Charlie. It's strange that he should have judged you so accurately. It was just like him to expose me to such a cruel disillusion."</div>

<div class="line_en">"He knew that you were vain, cowardly, and self-seeking. He wanted me to see it with my own eyes. He knew that you'd run like a hare at the approach of danger.

He knew you'd sacrifice me without a pang to save your own skin."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他明白你爱慕虚荣，胆小怕事，自我钻营。他是叫我自己用眼睛来看清你。他知道你一定会狗急跳墙。他知道我一直以为你爱着我，其实是我犯的愚蠢的错误。他知道你除了自己根本不会爱别人。他知道你为了保全自己，会毫无怜惜地牺牲掉我。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"If it really gives you any satisfaction to say beastly things to me I suppose I've got no right to complain. Women always are unfair and they generally manage to put a man in the wrong. But there is something to be said on the other side."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“倘若对我施以谩骂能使你心满意足，我想我无权抱怨。女人从来都是褊狭的，在她们眼里，男人永远是错的一方。其实另外那一方也并非一身清白，无可指摘。”">查看中文翻译</div>
