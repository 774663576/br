<div class="line_cn" title="她开始哭了，眼泪痛痛快快、毫不逗留地滚下来。她没有擦掉泪痕的意思，现在哭一会儿对她来说是个喘息的机会，她必须趁机稳住阵脚。然而她大脑里一片空白。他无动于衷地盯着她，她没料到他竟然丝毫不为所动。他不耐烦了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I had no illusions about you," he said. "I knew you were silly and frivolous and empty-headed. But I loved you. I knew that your aims and ideals were vulgar and commonplace. But I loved you. I knew that you were second-rate. But I loved you. It's comic when I think how hard I tried to be amused by the things that amused you and how anxious I was to hide from you that I wasn't ignorant and vulgar and scandal-mongering and stupid. I knew how frightened you were of intelligence and I did everything I could to make you think me as big a fool as the rest of the men you knew. I knew that you'd only married me for convenience. I loved you so much, I didn't care. Most people, as far as I can see, when they're in love with someone and the love isn't returned feel that they have a grievance. They grow angry and bitter. I wasn't like that. I never expected you to love me, I didn't see any reason that you should, I never thought myself very lovable. I was thankful to be allowed to love you and I was enraptured when now and then I thought you were pleased with me or when I noticed in your eyes a gleam of good-humoured affection. I tried not to bore you with my love; I knew I couldn't afford to do that and I was always on the lookout for the first sign that you were impatient with my affection. What most husbands expect as a right I was prepared to receive as a favour."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我对你根本没抱幻想。”他说道，“我知道你愚蠢、轻佻、头脑空虚，然而我爱你。我知道你的企图、你的理想，你势利、庸俗，然而我爱你。我知道你是个二流货色，然而我爱你。为了欣赏你所热衷的那些玩意我竭尽全力，为了向你展示我并非不是无知、庸俗、闲言碎语、愚蠢至极，我煞费苦心。我知道智慧将会令你大惊失色，所以处处谨小慎微，务必表现得和你交往的任何男人一样像个傻瓜。我知道你仅仅为了一己之私跟我结婚。我爱你如此之深，这我毫不在意。据我所知，人们在爱上一个人却得不到回报时，往往感到伤心失望，继而变成愤怒和尖刻。我不是那样。我从未奢望你来爱我，我从未设想你会有理由爱我，我也从未认为我自己惹人爱慕。对我来说能被赐予机会爱你就应心怀感激了。每当我想到你跟我在一起是愉悦的，每当我从你的眼睛里看到欢乐，我都狂喜不已。我尽力将我的爱维持在不让你厌烦的限度，否则我清楚那个后果我承受不了。我时刻关注你的神色，但凡你的厌烦显现出一点蛛丝马迹，我便改变方式。一个丈夫的权利，在我看来却是一种恩惠。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Kitty, accustomed to flattery all her life, had never heard such things said to her before. Blind wrath, driving out fear, arose in her heart: it seemed to choke her, and she felt the blood-vessels in her temples swell and throb. Wounded vanity can make a woman more vindictive than a lioness robbed of her cubs.
