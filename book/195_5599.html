<div class="line_en">Josiah Graves in his masterful way made arrangements, becoming but economical, for the funeral; and when it was over came back to the vicarage with Philip. The will was in his charge, and with a due sense of the fitness of things he read it to Philip over an early cup of tea. It was written on half a sheet of paper and left everything Mr. Carey had to his nephew. There was the furniture, about eighty pounds at the bank, twenty shares in the A. B. C. company, a few in Allsop's brewery, some in the Oxford music-hall, and a few more in a London restaurant. They had been bought under Mr. Graves' direction, and he told Philip with satisfaction:</div>

<div class="line_en">Mr. Graves left him, after they had discussed the auction which must be held as soon as possible, and Philip sat himself down to go through the papers of the deceased. The Rev. William Carey had prided himself on never destroying anything, and there were piles of correspondence dating back for fifty years and bundles upon bundles of neatly docketed bills. He had kept not only letters addressed to him, but letters which himself had written. There was a yellow packet of letters which he had written to his father in the forties, when as an Oxford undergraduate he had gone to Germany for the long vacation. Philip read them idly. It was a different William Carey from the William Carey he had known, and yet there were traces in the boy which might to an acute observer have suggested the man. The letters were formal and a little stilted. He showed himself strenuous to see all that was noteworthy, and he described with a fine enthusiasm the castles of the Rhine. The falls of Schaffhausen made him `offer reverent thanks to the all-powerful Creator of the universe, whose works were wondrous and beautiful,' and he could not help thinking that they who lived in sight of `this handiwork of their blessed Maker must be moved by the contemplation to lead pure and holy lives.' Among some bills Philip found a miniature which had been painted of William Carey soon after he was ordained. It represented a thin young curate, with long hair that fell over his head in natural curls, with dark eyes, large and dreamy, and a pale ascetic face. Philip remembered the chuckle with which his uncle used to tell of the dozens of slippers which were worked for him by adoring ladies.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="格雷夫斯先生和菲利普商量好拍卖会应尽早举办，随后便告辞了。菲利普坐下来开始整理逝者留下的书信文件。威廉·凯利牧师向来以从不销毁自己的东西为傲，五十多年来的信件他都保存着，一捆捆扎好，还有好几摞齐齐整整的单据。这些信件里不光有别人写给他的，甚至还包括了他写给别人的。其中有一小叠发黄的，那是四十年代他在牛津读书时，有次去德国度假，与父亲的通信。菲利普随手翻看，信里的威廉·凯利和他所认识的大伯判若两人。如果你有敏锐的观察力，想来也能在当年的男孩身上寻到些如今的威廉·凯利的影子。这些信都写得非常正式，甚至有点做作而不自然。他写到自己为了把值得一看的景色都走一遍，可谓费劲了心力。他兴高采烈地跟父亲描述莱茵城堡之旅。莱茵瀑布壮丽的景色让他“对宇宙中无所不能的造物主所创下的奇迹叹为观止，诚心敬服”。他不禁想到“所有生活在敬爱的造物主创造的奇绝壮绝之景中的人，一定能感受到神迹，从而过上圣洁虔诚的生活”。菲利普从几张账单里扒翻出一张威廉·凯利刚刚就任神职后画的小画儿。画中是一个清瘦、年轻的副牧师形象，长发披肩，微微打卷，深黑的眸子大而迷茫，脸孔苍白，神色肃穆。菲利普想起伯伯曾经津津乐道地吹嘘，年轻的时候有好多可爱的小姐给他做了几十双拖鞋呢。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The rest of the afternoon and all the evening Philip toiled through the innumerable correspondence. He glanced at the address and at the signature, then tore the letter in two and threw it into the washing-basket by his side. Suddenly he came upon one signed Helen. He did not know the writing. It was thin, angular, and old-fashioned. It began: my dear William, and ended: your affectionate sister. Then it struck him that it was from his own mother. He had never seen a letter of hers before, and her handwriting was strange to him. It was about himself.</div>

I am going to ask you to do me a great favour. Both Stephen and I wish you to be the boy's godfather, and we hope that you will consent. I know I am not asking a small thing, for I am sure you will take the responsibilities of the position very seriously, but I am especially anxious that you should undertake this office because you are a clergyman as well as the boy's uncle. I am very anxious for the boy's welfare and I pray God night and day that he may grow into a good, honest, and Christian man. With you to guide him I hope that he will become a soldier in Christ's Faith and be all the days of his life God-fearing, humble, and pious.</div>

<div class="line_en">Philip pushed the letter away and, leaning forward, rested his face on his hands. It deeply touched and at the same time surprised him. He was astonished at its religious tone, which seemed to him neither mawkish nor sentimental. He knew nothing of his mother, dead now for nearly twenty years, but that she was beautiful, and it was strange to learn that she was simple and pious. He had never thought of that side of her. He read again what she said about him, what she expected and thought about him; he had turned out very differently; he looked at himself for a moment; perhaps it was better that she was dead. Then a sudden impulse caused him to tear up the letter; its tenderness and simplicity made it seem peculiarly private; he had a queer feeling that there was something indecent in his reading what exposed his mother's gentle soul. He went on with the Vicar's dreary correspondence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="菲利普把信一推，向前靠了靠，将脸埋在手心里。这封信让他深为感动，同时又大为吃惊。他想不到母亲竟是个对宗教如此虔诚的人。她的语言那么真诚，全无做作或矫情的痕迹。母亲过世已经有将近二十年了，他对她一无所知。可像她这样美丽的女人，却这般单纯而虔诚，简直令人感到奇怪。菲利普从不知道母亲还有这样的一面。他把信中提及自己的部分又重读一遍：她对他的期望、对他的担忧之情一览无遗。然而，菲利普却成为了一个与她期望的截然不同的人。片刻，他审视着自己：也许母亲的死是件好事吧。一股莫名冲动让他把这封信撕成了碎片。他心里有种奇怪的感觉，仿佛窥见了母亲敏感稚柔的灵魂、一个隐藏很深的秘密——这样朴素的柔情啊。他继续开始整理那堆枯燥乏味的信件。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A few days later he went up to London, and for the first time for two years entered by day the hall of St. Luke's Hospital. He went to see the secretary of the Medical School; he was surprised to see him and asked Philip curiously what he had been doing. Philip's experiences had given him a certain confidence in himself and a different outlook upon many things: such a question would have embarrassed him before; but now he answered coolly, with a deliberate vagueness which prevented further inquiry, that private affairs had obliged him to make a break in the curriculum; he was now anxious to qualify as soon as possible. The first examination he could take was in midwifery and the diseases of women, and he put his name down to be a clerk in the ward devoted to feminine ailments; since it was holiday time there happened to be no difficulty in getting a post as obstetric clerk; he arranged to undertake that duty during the last week of August and the first two of September. After this interview Philip walked through the Medical School, more or less deserted, for the examinations at the end of the summer session were all over; and he wandered along the terrace by the river-side. His heart was full. He thought that now he could begin a new life, and he would put behind him all the errors, follies, and miseries of the past. The flowing river suggested that everything passed, was passing always, and nothing mattered; the future was before him rich with possibilities.</div>

<div class="line_en">One afternoon Philip took it into his head to go over to Tercanbury and see his old school. He had not been there since the day when, with relief in his heart, he had left it with the feeling that thenceforward he was his own master. It was strange to wander through the narrow streets of Tercanbury which he had known so well for so many years. He looked at the old shops, still there, still selling the same things; the booksellers with school-books, pious works, and the latest novels in one window and photographs of the Cathedral and of the city in the other; the games shop, with its cricket bats, fishing tackle, tennis rackets, and footballs; the tailor from whom he had got clothes all through his boyhood; and the fishmonger where his uncle whenever he came to Tercanbury bought fish. He wandered along the sordid street in which, behind a high wall, lay the red brick house which was the preparatory school. Further on was the gateway that led into King's School, and he stood in the quadrangle round which were the various buildings. It was just four and the boys were hurrying out of school. He saw the masters in their gowns and mortar-boards, and they were strange to him. It was more than ten years since he had left and many changes had taken place. He saw the headmaster; he walked slowly down from the schoolhouse to his own, talking to a big boy who Philip supposed was in the sixth; he was little changed, tall, cadaverous, romantic as Philip remembered him, with the same wild eyes; but the black beard was streaked with gray now and the dark, sallow face was more deeply lined. Philip had an impulse to go up and speak to him, but he was afraid he would have forgotten him, and he hated the thought of explaining who he was.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一天下午，菲利普惦记着去特坎伯雷，回母校看看。他还记着从学校离开时那种如释重负的感觉，好像从此之后他就能成为自己的主人。打从那一天起，他再也没有回去过了。再一次漫步在曾经如此熟悉的街道上，感觉非常奇怪。他看到过去那些商店依然开门营业，卖着和十几年前相同的东西：书店的一扇橱窗里摆满学校课本、宗教读物、最新的小说，另一扇则是城镇和大教堂的照片；体育器材店里出售板球棍、钓鱼竿、网球拍和足球。他小时候穿的衣服都来自镇上的裁缝铺。那爿鱼店也还开着门，过去伯伯每次来特坎伯雷都要来这儿买几尾鱼带回家。菲利普沿着脏兮兮的小道往前走，这条道在一堵高墙后面，而另一边就是预备学校的红砖楼。再往远处能看到皇家学院的大门，他站在一片四方形的空地中间，周围是各式各样的楼房。此时刚到下午四点，学生们争先恐后地从学校里往外跑。菲利普看到几个穿长袍、戴学士帽的老师，可他一个也不认识。他离校已经有十多年了，这里发生了太多变化。忽然，菲利普看到了校长。他正和一个年纪挺大的男孩（菲利普猜他大概是六年级的学生）说着话，从教学楼慢慢往自己办公室走。校长没怎么变模样，依旧像菲利普记忆中的那般个子高瘦、面色苍白、神态古怪。他的眼睛依然奕奕有神，只不过黑色的胡子像染了层白霜，蜡黄的脸上沟壑也比过去更多。菲利普有种想走上前去同他打招呼的冲动，可又怕他已经忘了自己。他不愿跟别人解释自己是谁。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Boys lingered talking to one another, and presently some who had hurried to change came out to play fives; others straggled out in twos and threes and went out of the gateway, Philip knew they were going up to the cricket ground; others again went into the precincts to bat at the nets. Philip stood among them a stranger; one or two gave him an indifferent glance; but visitors, attracted by the Norman staircase, were not rare and excited little attention. Philip looked at them curiously. He thought with melancholy of the distance that separated him from them, and he thought bitterly how much he had wanted to do and how little done. It seemed to him that all those years, vanished beyond recall, had been utterly wasted. The boys, fresh and buoyant, were doing the same things that he had done, it seemed that not a day had passed since he left the school, and yet in that place where at least by name he had known everybody now he knew not a soul. In a few years these too, others taking their place, would stand alien as he stood; but the reflection brought him no solace; it merely impressed upon him the futility of human existence. Each generation repeated the trivial round. He wondered what had become of the boys who were his companions: they were nearly thirty now; some would be dead, but others were married and had children; they were soldiers and parsons, doctors, lawyers; they were staid men who were beginning to put youth behind them. Had any of them made such a hash of life as he? He thought of the boy he had been devoted to; it was funny, he could not recall his name; he remembered exactly what he looked like, he had been his greatest friend; but his name would not come back to him. He looked back with amusement on the jealous emotions he had suffered on his account. It was irritating not to recollect his name. He longed to be a boy again, like those he saw sauntering through the quadrangle, so that, avoiding his mistakes, he might start fresh and make something more out of life. He felt an intolerable loneliness. He almost regretted the penury which he had suffered during the last two years, since the desperate struggle merely to keep body and soul together had deadened the pain of living. In the sweat of thy brow shalt thou earn thy daily bread: it was not a curse upon mankind, but the balm which reconciled it to existence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="男孩叽叽喳喳地聊着天，几个刚才跑去换衣服的学生这会儿已经出来准备打墙手球了。还有一些三三两两、成群结队地跑出校门。菲利普知道他们要去板球场。剩下的又跑回操场对着球网练习。菲利普站在这群学生中间，像个陌生人。学校里诺曼风格的楼梯吸引了不少慕名前来的游客，所以男孩们早已对校园里的陌生面孔见怪不怪，只偶尔有一两个男孩朝菲利普冷冷扫过一眼。菲利普好奇地打量他们。他想到自己和这些男孩之间的距离，心中不免悲伤。曾经的他也想做成一番大事，最终却落得一事无成。他觉得那段被记忆尘封的少年时光似乎白白浪费了。而眼前的男孩生气勃勃、青春洋溢，正做着和他当年一模一样的事。恍惚间，他仿佛从没离开过这所学校。当年这里所有人的名字他都记得清清楚楚，可现在却一个都不认识。再过几年，学校的学生又会重换一批，而这些男孩若是重回母校，便也会发现自己像个格格不入的异乡之客。这样想来，菲利普却依然不觉安慰，只让他更加感叹人这一生庸庸碌碌、岁月虚度，一代又一代周而复始，在繁琐无味的生活中轮回。他不知道过去的同窗好友如今都过得怎样。他们应该快到而立之年，有些可能早就死了；有些成家立业，娶妻生子；还有的也许成了士兵、牧师、医生、律师。岁月早就挫平他们的锐气，青春也已经一去不返。是否有人的处境同菲利普一样糟糕呢？他想起自己过去最喜欢的男孩，可笑的是，他竟然记不起男孩的名字了。菲利普还清楚记得他的样子，记得他是自己最好的朋友，却怎么也想不起他的名字来。当年菲利普一个人暗暗生闷气，看着他和别的男孩打成一片心里就嫉妒不已，现在再想起这些事，不禁哑然失笑，而想不起他的名字则令人更加恼火。菲利普想重新做个小男孩，就像这些在操场上走来走去的男孩一样，绝不再犯同样的错误，从头开始崭新的、有所成就的人生。此刻，孤独无孔不入，难以忍受。过去的两年里，他赧颜苟活，受遍屈辱，将绝望而痛苦的挣扎一一做尽。也正因为此，他在想起这两年的贫困处境时，深感后悔不已。一分耕耘一分收获——这不是强加于人的诅咒，反而是抚慰心灵的妙药。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But Philip was impatient with himself; he called to mind his idea of the pattern of life: the unhappiness he had suffered was no more than part of a decoration which was elaborate and beautiful; he told himself strenuously that he must accept with gaiety everything, dreariness and excitement, pleasure and pain, because it added to the richness of the design. He sought for beauty consciously, and he remembered how even as a boy he had taken pleasure in the Gothic cathedral as one saw it from the precincts; he went there and looked at the massive pile, gray under the cloudy sky, with the central tower that rose like the praise of men to their God; but the boys were batting at the nets, and they were lissom and strong and active; he could not help hearing their shouts and laughter. The cry of youth was insistent, and he saw the beautiful thing before him only with his eyes.</div>
