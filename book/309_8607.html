He motioned to speak again but was distracted by the feathery appearance of Max Vandenburg, who stood politely, embarrassed, in the doorway.

<div class="line_en">Sitting on the floor of the mayor's roomful of books, Liesel Meminger heard those words. A bag of washing was at her side and the ghostly figure of the mayor's wife was sitting hunch-drunk over at the desk. In front of her, Liesel read The Whistler, pages twenty-two and twenty-three.

<div class="line_en">The mayor's wife nodded. If there was one thing about Liesel Meminger, her thieving was not gratuitous. She only stole books on what she felt was a need-to-have basis. Currently, she had enough. She'd gone through The Mud Men four times now and was enjoying her reacquaintance with The Shoulder Shrug. Also, each night before bed, she would open a fail-safe guide to grave digging. Buried deep inside it, The Standover Man resided. She mouthed the words and touched the birds. She turned the noisy pages, slowly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="镇长太太点点头。要说莉泽尔·梅明格这个人的特点，那就是她绝不是一个随便出手偷书的人。只有当她觉得非偷不可的时候，她才会出手。目前来说，她已经有足够多的书了。她已经把《泥人》从头到尾读了四遍，并享受着与《耸耸肩膀》的久别重逢。每晚睡觉前，她还会打开那本安全掘墓指南，里面夹着那一本《俯视我的人》。她默念着文字，抚摸着画上的鸟儿，缓缓地翻动微微作响的书页。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She exited the library, walked down the floorboard hall and out the monstrous doorway. As was her habit, she stood for a while on the steps, looking at Molching beneath her.

On the wall, he painted a long, tightly knotted rope with a dripping yellow sun at the end of it, as if you could dive right into it. On the ropy cloud, he drew two figures -- a thin girl and a withering Jew -- and they were walking, arms balanced, toward that dripping sun. Beneath the picture, he wrote the following sentence.</div>

<div class="line_en">What he needed was a series of new projects. The first was exercise. He started with push-ups, lying stomach-down on the cool basement floor, then hoisting himself up. It felt like his arms snapped at each elbow, and he envisaged his heart seeping out of him and dropping pathetically to the ground. As a teenager in Stuttgart, he could reach fifty push-ups at a time. Now, at the age of twenty-four, perhaps fifteen pounds lighter than his usual weight, he could barely make it to ten. After a week, he was completing three sets each of sixteen push-ups and twenty-two sit-ups. When he was finished, he would sit against the basement wall with his paint-can friends, feeling his pulse in his teeth. His muscles felt like cake.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他需要一系列新鲜的活动。排在第一位的便是运动。他从俯卧撑做起，先是肚子朝下趴在冰冷的地面上，然后把自己撑起来。他感到两侧的肘关节都在咯嗒作响，担心心脏会从胸口跳出来，悲哀地落到地上。当他还是个生活在斯图加特的少年时，他能一口气做五十个俯卧撑。而现在，二十四岁的他比往日轻了大约十五磅，只能勉强做十个。一星期后，他每次能做十六个俯卧撑和二十二个仰卧起坐，并重复三次了。锻炼完毕，他便靠在墙上，感受着齿根处跳动的脉搏，身旁是那些油漆罐朋友。他的肌肉像蛋糕一样。">查看中文翻译</div>

How could every person there have so much to say at the same time? The ring itself was perfect. Perfect canvas, lovely ropes. Even the stray hairs of each thickened string were flawless, gleaming in the tight white light. The room smelled like cigarettes and beer.</div>

<div class="line_en">Diagonally across, Adolf Hitler stood in the corner with his entourage. His legs poked out from a red-and-white robe with a black swastika burned into its back. His mustache was knitted to his face. Words were whispered to him from his trainer, Goebbels. He bounced foot to foot, and he smiled. He smiled loudest when the ring announcer listed his many achievements, which were all vociferously applauded by the adoring crowd. "Undefeated!" the ringmaster proclaimed. "Over many a Jew, and over any other threat to the German ideal! Herr Fuhrer," he concluded, "we salute you!" The crowd: mayhem.</div>

<div class="line_en">The ringmaster swung over toward Max, who stood alone in the challenger's corner. No robe. No entourage. Just a lonely young Jew with dirty breath, a naked chest, and tired hands and feet. Naturally, his shorts were gray. He too moved from foot to foot, but it was kept at a minimum to conserve energy. He'd done a lot of sweating in the gym to make the weight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="拳击场老板转向马克斯，挑战者孤零零地站在属于他的角落里。没有长袍在身，没有团队助阵。只有一位形单影只的犹太青年，气息污浊，胸膛裸露，四肢疲乏。他的拳击短裤当然是灰色的。他也换着腿跳动着热身，但动作幅度很小，从而尽可能地保存体力。为了让体重达标，他在运动场里挥洒了许多汗水。">查看中文翻译</div>

He addressed only the Fuhrer now. "Unless, of course, Herr Hitler, you begin to lose. Should this occur, I will be quite willing to turn a blind eye to any unconscionable tactics you might employ to grind this piece of Jewish stench and filth into the canvas." He nodded, with great courtesy. "Is that clear?"</div>

<div class="line_en">First out was the Fuhrer, awkward-legged and bony, running at Max and jabbing him firmly in the face. The crowd vibrated, the bell still in their ears, and their satisfied smiles hurdled the ropes. The smoky breath of Hitler steamed from his mouth as his hands bucked at Max's face, collecting him several times, on the lips, the nose, the chin -- and Max had still not ventured out of his corner. To absorb the punishment, he held up his hands, but the Fuhrer then aimed at his ribs, his kidneys, his lungs. Oh, the eyes, the Fuhrer's eyes. They were so deliciously brown -- like Jews' eyes -- and they were so determined that even Max stood transfixed for a moment as he caught sight of them between the healthy blur of punching gloves.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="腿脚笨拙、身形瘦削的元首率先发难，他冲向马克斯挥出一拳，实实在在地击中了马克斯的脸。人群欢呼雀跃，铃声还回荡在他们耳际，而他们心满意足的笑容几乎要跨过围绳飞过来了。希特勒的拳头飞向马克斯的脸庞，砸在他的嘴唇、鼻子和下巴上，热气也从元首的嘴里喷薄而出，然而马克斯甚至还没能从那个角落里走出来。为了抵挡进攻，他抬起双手，可元首随即将目标转向他的肋骨、他的肾、他的肺。噢，那双眼睛，元首的那双眼睛。它们有着如此美丽的棕色，就像犹太人的眼睛一样，其中流露的意志是如此坚定，当马克斯在接连袭来的拳击手套间瞥见那双眼睛时，也为这神采感到惊诧。">查看中文翻译</div>

On his knees, the Fuhrer tested himself for blood and straightened his hair, right to left.

He turned his back on the Jew and took the gloves from his fists.</div>

It was the sound of a grave. If only mine was ready now, she thought -- because Liesel Meminger, at that moment, wanted to die. When the others had canceled, it hadn't hurt so much. There was always the mayor, his library, and her connection with his wife. Also, this was the last one, the last hope, gone. This time, it felt like the greatest betrayal.</div>
