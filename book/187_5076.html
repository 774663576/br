<div class="line_en">Tirian had thought -- or he would have thought if he had time to think at all -- that they were inside a little thatched stable, about twelve feet long and six feet wide. In reality they stood on grass, the deep blue sky was overhead, and the air which blew gently on their faces was that of a day in early summer. Not far away from them rose a grove of trees, thickly leaved, but under every leaf there peeped out the gold or faint yellow or purple or glowing red of fruits such as no one has seen in our world. The fruit made Tirian feel that it must be autumn but there was something in the feel of the air that told him it could not be later than June. They all moved towards the trees.</div>

<div class="line_en">What was the fruit like? Unfortunately no one can describe a taste. All I can say is that, compared with those fruits, the freshest grapefruit you've ever eaten was dull, and the juiciest orange was dry, and the most melting pear was hard and woody, and the sweetest wild strawberry was sour. And there were no seeds or stones, and no wasps. If you had once eaten that fruit, all the nicest things in this world would taste like medicines after it. But I can't describe it. You can't find out what it is like unless you can get to that country and taste it for yourself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是种什么样的果实？可惜得很，没有一个人能把它的味道描摹出来。我能说的只不过是：同这些果实比较起来，你所吃过的最新鲜的葡萄就显得单调乏味了，汁液最丰富的橘子就显得太干了，入口而化的梨就显得又硬又木了，最甜的野生草莓就显得酸了。这些果实没有籽，没有核，也没有黄蜂。你一旦吃过这些果实，从今以后，吃世界上一切最美妙的东西都会觉得味同吃药一样。但它的味道究竟如何，我还是描摹不出来。除非你能够到那个国家去亲口尝一尝，你是没法儿知道它的滋味的。">查看中文翻译</div>

There was a frightful roar and something hit me with a bang, but it didn't hurt. And I felt not so much scared as -- well, excited. Oh -- and this is one queer thing.

Only a few yards away, clear to be seen in the sunlight, there stood up a rough wooden door and, round it, the framework of the doorway: nothing else, no walls, no roof. He walked towards it, bewildered, and the others followed, watching to see what he would do. He walked round to the other side of the door. But it looked just the same from the other side: he was still in the open air, on a summer morning. The door was simply standing up by itself as if it had grown there like a tree.</div>

<div class="line_en">Tirian put his eye to the hole. At first he could see nothing but blackness. Then, at his eyes grew used to it, he saw the dull red glow of a bonfire that was nearly going out, and above that, in a black sky, stars. Then he could see dark figures moving about or standing between him and the fire: he could hear them talking and their voices were like those of Calormenes. So he knew that he was looking out through the stable door into the darkness of Lantern Waste where he had fought his last battle. The men were discussing whether to go in and look for Rishda Tarkaan (but none of them wanted to do that) or to set fire to the stable.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="蒂莲把眼睛凑在裂缝上。起初他什么也看不见，只看见一片黑暗。稍后他的眼睛习惯了，就看见了即将熄灭的篝火的暗红色的火光，篝火上方黑暗天空里的繁星。接着他看见了在篝火和他之间往来走动或站着的黑色形体：他听得见他们在说话，他们的声音就跟那些卡乐门士兵的声音一个样儿。所以他就知道他正透过马厩的门往外望到了他刚打过最后一仗的灯柱野林上的一片黑暗。士兵们正讨论着是否要进去找找“泰坎”利什达（但没有人肯去办这事）或者干脆放火烧掉马厩。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"After the shock and the noise," said Lucy, "we found ourselves here. And we wondered at the door, as you did. Then the door opened for the first time (we saw darkness through the doorway when it did) and there came through a big man with a naked sword. We saw by his arms that he was a Calormene. He took his stand beside the door with his sword raised, resting on his shoulder, ready to cut down anyone who came through. We went to him and spoke to him, but we thought he could neither see nor hear us. And he never looked round on the sky and the sunlight and the grass: I think he couldn't see them either. So then we waited a long time. Then we heard the bolt being drawn on the other side of the door. But the man didn't get ready to strike with his sword till he could see who was coming in. So we supposed he had been told to strike some and spare others. But at the very moment when the door opened, all of a sudden Tash was there, on this side of the door; none of us saw where he came from. And through the door there came a big Cat. It gave one look at Tash and ran for its life: just in time, for he pounced at it and the door hit his beak as it was shut. The man could see Tash. He turned very pale and bowed down before the Monster: but it vanished away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“震荡和嘈杂喧闹之后，”露茜说，“我们发现自己来到这儿了。像你一样，我们在门口感到惊奇。然后是门第一次打开了（开门时我们从门口望到了一片黑暗），从门里出来一个大个儿，手里拿着一把出了鞘的剑。我们从胳膊看出来他是个卡乐门人。他站在门边，举起的剑靠在肩膀上，准备砍杀任何进入门来的人。我们走过去同他说话，但我们觉得他既看不见我们，又听不见我们的话。他从不朝四周看望，从不看看天空、阳光和青草：我认为他也看不见它们。所以我们等待了好久。然后我们听到门的那一边把门闩拔掉了。但这兵在看清楚进来的是谁之前，是不准备把剑砍下去的。所以我们推测他曾奉命砍杀某些人而放过其他的人。但，就在打开门的那一刻，塔什突然出现了，就在门的这一边，我们谁也没看见他是从哪儿来的。接着是从门里进来一只大猫。大猫对塔什看了一眼就奔跑逃命了，逃得还及时，因为塔什向猫儿扑去时，门关上时碰到了他的鸟嘴巴。士兵能看得见塔什。他的脸色变得十分苍白，他拜倒在那怪物面前：可是怪物消失了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes," said Queen Lucy. "In our world too, a stable once had something inside it that was bigger than our whole world." It was the first time she had spoken, and from the thrill in her voice, Tirian now knew why. She was drinking everything in even more deeply than the others. She had been too happy to speak. He wanted to hear her speak again, so he said: "Of your courtesy, Madam, tell on. Tell me your whole adventure."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，”女王露茜说，“在我们的世界上也是这样的：一个马厩，一旦里边儿装了点东西，就比我们整个儿世界大了。”这是她第一次说话，从她声音的颤动里，蒂莲现在知道其所以然了。她对这儿的一切事物，比其他人的感受都要深得多。她快乐得说不出话来。他要听她再说话，所以他说道：“如蒙同意，女士，请讲下去吧。请把你整个冒险过程讲给我听吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Lucy led the way and soon they could all see the Dwarfs. They had a very odd look. They weren't strolling about or enjoying themselves (although the cords with which they had been tied seemed to have vanished) nor were they lying down and having a rest. They were sitting very close together in a little circle facing one another. They never looked round or took any notice of the humans till Lucy and Tirian were almost near enough to touch them. Then the Dwarfs all cocked their heads as if they couldn't see anyone but were listening hard and trying to guess by the sound what was happening.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="露茜带路，他们大家不久就都看见小矮人们了。小矮人们有一种非常古怪的神情。他们既不在散步或是玩得很开心（虽然把他们捆绑起来的绳索似乎已经消失了），又不是在躺下休息。他们正十分密集地面对面地坐成一个小圈。他们从不向四周看看，直至露茜和蒂莲走得够近了，几乎要碰到他们了，他们才注意到有人走来了。这时小矮人们才都昂起头来，仿佛他们不能看到什么人，只好拼命地谛听，力图从声音上猜测正在发生什么事情。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Let 'em alone," said Eustace: but as he spoke the earth trembled. The sweet air grew suddenly sweeter. A brightness flashed behind them. All turned. Tirian turned last because he was afraid. There stood his heart's desire, huge and real, the golden Lion, Aslan himself, and already the others were kneeling in a circle round his forepaws and burying their hands and faces in his mane as he stooped his great head to touch them with his tongue. Then he fixed his eyes upon Tirian, and Tirian came near, trembling, and flung himself at the Lion's feet, and the Lion kissed him and said, "Well done, last of the Kings of Narnia who stood firm at the darkest hour."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Dearest," said Aslan, "I will show you both what I can, and what I cannot, do." He came close to the Dwarfs and gave a low growl: low, but it set all the air shaking. But the Dwarfs said to one another, "Hear that? That's the gang at the other end of the stable. Trying to frighten us. They do it with a machine of some kind. Don't take any notice. They won't take us in again!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“最亲爱的，”阿斯兰说道，“我能做到的和不能做到的，我都会让你们看到的。”他走近小矮人们，发出一声长啸，声音低沉，可是所有的空气都震动了。但小矮人们互相问答道，“听到吗？那是马厩那一头的那一帮子搞的。要想吓唬我们。他们用一种机器弄出来的声音。不必理它的。他们休想叫我们再受骗上当了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Aslan raised his head and shook his mane. Instantly a glorious feast appeared on the Dwarfs' knees: pies and tongues and pigeons and trifles and ices, and each Dwarf had a goblet of good wine in his right hand. But it wasn't much use.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿斯兰抬起头来，摇晃他的鬣毛。小矮人们的膝头上立刻出现了精美的大菜：馅饼、酱舌、鸽子、甜食和冰淇淋。每个小矮人的右手里都有一杯好酒。但大菜也没有多大用处。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They began eating and drinking greedily enough, but it was clear that they couldn't taste it properly. They thought they were eating and drinking only the sort of things you might find in a stable. One said he was trying to eat hay and another said he had a bit of an old turnip and a third said he'd found a raw cabbage leaf. And they raised golden goblets of rich red wine to their lips and said "Ugh! Fancy drinking dirty water out of a trough that a donkey's been at! Never thought we'd come to this." But very soon every Dwarf began suspecting that every other Dwarf had found something nicer than he had, and they started grabbing and snatching, and went on to quarrelling, till in a few minutes there was a free fight and all the good food was smeared on their faces and clothes or trodden under foot.
