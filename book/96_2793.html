<div class="line_en">To Sophie's relief, Calcifer blazed up bright and cheerful next morning. If she had not had enough of Howl, she would have been almost touched by how glad Howl was to see Calcifer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="次日早晨，看到卡西法明亮快活地燃烧着时，苏菲真是松了一口气。如果她不是受够了哈尔的话，还真会被哈尔看到看西法时那份神情所感动。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, don't let her make you do it again," said Howl. He stood up, gracefully brushing ash off his gray-and-scarlet suit. "Make a start on that spell today, Michael. And if anyone comes from the King, I'm away on urgent private business until tomorrow. I'm going to see Lettie, but you needn't tell him that." He picked up his guitar and opened the door with the knob green-down, onto the wide, cloudy hills.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好了，下次别让她在指使你做同样的事了。”他站起来，优雅地将灰红色外套上的灰烬拂掉。“麦可，你今天可以开始弄那个咒语了。还有，如果国王那边派人来，就跟他说我有要紧的私人事件要处理，明天才会回来。我要去找乐蒂，不过你犯不着告诉他。”他拿起吉他，将门把往下转到绿色，打开门，外面是宽广、多云的山丘。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The scarecrow was there again. When Howl opened the door, it pitched sideways across him with its turnip face in his chest. The guitar uttered an awful twang-oing. Sophie gave a faint squawk of terror and hung onto the chair. One of the scarecrow's stick arms was scraping stiffly around to get a purchase on the door. From the way Howl's feet were braced, it was clear he was being shoved quite hard. There was no doubt the thing was determined to get into the castle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="稻草人又出现了。哈尔开门时它正好由侧面跳过来，萝卜脸就撞在哈尔胸前，吉他发出当的一声。苏菲紧抓住椅子，害怕得哇哇叫，声音衰弱无力。稻草人的一只手僵硬地抓扒着，想抓住门，木杆压在哈尔脚上，依哈尔抱着脚的样子看来，那一下还真是踩得不轻。无疑地，那家伙是吃了秤砣铁了心，非要进来不可。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh, is there" Do tell!" Howl panted. He got one foot up against the door frame and heaved. The scarecrow flew lumpishly away backward, to land with a light rustle in the heather some yards off. It sprang up instantly and came hopping towards the castle again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是吗？现在才来说！”哈尔喘着气。举起一只脚，对着门框边踹过去，稻草人整个向后飞出去，跌在后头满是石楠的地上，发出‘沙’的一声轻响。它马上一跃而起，再度对着城堡跳过来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Howl hurriedly laid the guitar on the doorstep and jumped down to meet it. "No you don't, my friend," he said with one hand out. "Go back where you came from." He walked forward slowly, still with his hand out. The scarecrow retreated a little, hopping slowly and warily backward. When Howl stopped, the scarecrow stopped too, with its one leg planted in the heather and its ragged arms tilting this way and that like a person sparring for an opening. The rags fluttering on its arms seemed a mad imitation of Howl's sleeves.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈尔匆忙将吉他放在门口阶梯上，跳下去迎战。“朋友，不成的。”边说边举起一只手来：“回你原来的地方去！”他慢慢向它走过去，手仍伸着。稻草人稍稍往后退，慢慢地、小心地往后跳。脚踩在石楠上，衣袖褴褛的双手不时晃动着，像格斗者在寻找对方的空门似的，双臂上飞扬的破布恰好与哈尔的长袖相辉映。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"So you won't go?" Howl said. And the turnip head slowly moved from side to side. No. "I'm afraid you'll have to," Howl said. "You scare Sophie, and there's no knowing what she'll do when she's scared. Come to think of it, you scare me too."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“还是不肯走吗？”哈尔问它。稻草人头慢慢地左右摇动，不走！“恐怕你非走不可，”哈尔说：“你把苏菲吓坏了。没人知道她吓坏时会做出什么事来。事实上，你也吓到我了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Calcifer's blue face leaned out of the grate. Michael stood stock still beyond. "There really is a scarecrow!" they both said.</div>

<div class="line_en">Howl's arms moved, heavily, as if he was lifting a large weight, until they were raised high above his head. He shouted out a strange word, which was half hidden in a crack of sudden thunder. And the scarecrow went soaring away. Up and backward it went, rags fluttering, arms wheeling in protest, up and out, and on and on, until it was a soaring speck in the sky, then a vanishing point in the clouds, and then not to be seen at all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈尔的双手开始动，很吃力的样子，仿佛举重一般，直到高高举到头上为止。他大声喊出一个奇怪的字，声音被突然出现的累声掩盖了一半，稻草人就飞了起来，向上，向后飞，破布在风中飞扬，双手转动着在抗议，越飞越高，越飞越远，渐渐成为高空中的一点，然后在云端中渺不可见，之后就再也看不见了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sophie gave a weak little cackle of laughter. Her heart was behaving badly again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="苏菲无力地笑了几声，她的心脏又开始不舒服了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Howl lowered his arms and came back to the doorway, mopping his face on the back of his hand. "I take back my hard words, Sophie," he said, panting. "That thing was alarming. It may have been dragging the castle back all yesterday. It had some of the strongest magic I've met. Whatever was it -- all that was left of the last person you cleaned for?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈尔放下手，回到门阶，以手背擦脸，喘着气说：“苏菲，我要收回那些责怪你的话。那家伙乱恐怖的。昨天也许就是它在后面拉着城堡，它拥有我所见过最强的魔法。那到底是什么东西呢？该不会是你以前顾主的屋子，被你清洁后剩下的部分吧？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Howl realized something was wrong with her. He jumped indoors across his guitar, took hold of her elbow, and sat her in the chair.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈尔注意到她不对劲，跳过吉他，进入门里，扶住她的手肘，让她在椅子上坐下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Take it easy now!" Something happened between Howl and Calcifer then. Sophie felt it, because e she was being held by Howl, and Calcifer was still leaning out of the grate. Whatever it was, her heart began to behave properly again almost at once. Howl looked at Calcifer, shrugged, and turned away to give Michael a whole lot of instructions about making Sophie keep quiet for the rest of the day. Then he picked up the guitar and left at last.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“慢慢来，慢慢来。”苏菲感到哈尔和卡西法之间好象发生了点什么。她所以能感觉到，是因为当时哈尔正扶着她，而卡西法仍旧探身在壁炉之外。不论那是什么，她的心脏几乎是马上又开始正常地跳动。哈尔看了卡西法一眼，耸耸肩，然后转身对麦可发出一长串、关于如何让苏菲静养一整天的指令，然后拿起吉他，终于出门去了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sophie lay in the chair and pretended to feel twice as ill as she did, she had to let Howl get out of sight. It was a nuisance he was going to Upper Folding as well, but she would walk so much more slowly that she would arrive around the time he started back. The important thing was not to meet him on the way. She watched Michael slyly while he spread out his spell and scratched his head over it. She waited until he dragged big leather books off the shelves and began making notes in a frantic, depressed sort of way. When he seemed properly absorbed, Sophie muttered several times, "Stuffy in here!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="苏菲在椅子上躺着，假装自己病得起码有两倍严重。她必须趁哈尔不在时做这件事。糟糕的是，他也是要去上福而丁。不过她可以慢慢地走。这样，她可以在他差不多要起程回来的时候抵达。重点是，不能在路上叫他撞着。麦可将咒语摊开来，搔着头在伤脑筋。苏菲在旁偷偷观察他，她一直等到他由书架上取下一本厚厚的皮革书，疯狂、似乎又很苦恼地开始做笔记。看他似乎是非常专注在工作上了，苏菲开始喃喃地说：“这儿好闷。”一连说了几次。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Michael took no notice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="麦可完全没有反应。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Terribly stuffy," Sophie said, getting up and shambling to the door. "Fresh air." She opened the door and climbed out. Calcifer obligingly stopped the castle dead while she did. Sophie landed in the heather and took a look round to get her bearings. The road over the hills to Upper Folding was a sandy line through the heather just downhill from the castle. Naturally. Calcifer would not make things inconvenient for Howl. Sophie set off toward it. She felt a little sad. She was going to miss Michael and Calcifer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“闷得要命。”苏菲边说边起身，往门口蹒跚走去。“新鲜空气！”边说边打开门爬出区，卡西法不得不让城堡完全停顿下来。苏菲走下石楠地，四处眺望，以确定自己的位置。越过山丘往上福而丁的路，是一条穿越石楠地的多沙小路，就在城堡下坡不远处。卡西法当然不会让哈尔不方便。苏菲开始对着那条路走去，她觉得有些悲伤，她会想念麦可跟卡西法的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="苏菲越听越生气，几乎想动手揍他了，他突然大叫道：“等等！放扫帚的柜子里有一双七里格靴！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He took Sophie by her skinny old wrist and towed her uphill to the waiting castle. She was forced to give little hops in order not to catch her feet in the heather. "But," she panted, "seven leagues is twenty-one miles! I'd be halfway to Porthaven in two strides!"</div>

<div class="line_en">Michael was so pleased with himself that Sophie did not have the heart to protest. She shrugged and supposed Michael had better find out about the two Lettie's before they changed looks again. It was more honest this way.

Up to now she had thought they were two leather buckets that had somehow lost their handles and then got a little squashed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="麦可显然是太得意了，让苏菲不好泼他冷水。她耸耸肩不置可否，心里想到，或许让麦可在两个乐蒂把外貌换回之前让他知道事实比较好，这样比较诚实。但是当麦可由储物柜拿出七里格靴时，她开始犹豫。她一直以为它们是两个掉了提柄，又被挤压得有点变形的皮桶，谁知道…">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You're supposed to put your foot in them, shoe and all," Michael explained as he carried the two heavy, bucket-shaped things to the door.

He and Sophie sat on the doorstep and each put one foot in a boot. "Point yourself toward Upper Folding before you put the boot down," Michael warned her.

<div class="line_cn" title="他们走过草原，往菲菲克丝太太叫走去，苏菲的心跳不由得稍稍加快，但只是像一下子做了许多事后那种心跳的感觉，她不禁对哈尔和卡西法稍早为她所做的事充满感激。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sophie agreed. The house was the biggest in the village. It was thatched, with white walls between the black beams, and, and Sophie remembered from visits as a child, you walked up to the porch through a garden crowded with flowers and humming with bees. Over the porch honeysuckle and a white climbing rose were competing as to which could give most work to the bees. It was a perfect, hot summer morning down here in Upper Folding.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mrs. Fairfax answered the door herself. She was one of those plump, comfortable ladies, with swathes of butter-colored hair coiled round her head, who made you feel good with life just to look at her. Sophie felt just the tiniest bit envious of Lettie. Mrs. Fairfax looked from Sophie to Michael. She had seen Sophie last a year ago as a girl of seventeen, and there was no reason for her to recognize her as an old woman of ninety. "Good morning to you," she said politely.</div>

"I'll put a spell on you of you do that once more!" The dog blinked and crouched down. Mrs. Fairfax pointed a stern finger. "Into the house! Stay in the house!" The collie shook himself free of Michael's hands and slunk away round the house again. "Thank you so much," Mrs. Fairfax said to Michael as they all followed it. "He will keep trying to bite Lettie's visitor. Inside!" she shouted sternly in the front garden, as the collie seemed to be thinking of going round the house and getting the orchard the other way.

"And I said to Lettie, 'Here's your big chance, my love.' I knew Howl could teach her twenty times more than I could -- for I don't mind telling you, Lettie's brains go way beyond mine, and she could end up in the same league as the Witch of the Waste, only in a good way. Lettie's a good girl and I'm fond of her. If Mrs. Pentstemmon was still teaching, I'd have Lettie go to her tomorrow. But she isn't. So I said, 'Lettie, here's Wizard Howl courting you and you could do worse than to fall in love with him yourself and let him be your teacher. The pair of you will go far.' I don't think Lettie was too keen on the idea at first, but she's been softening lately, and today it seems to be going beautifully."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“对我而言，那些大多是传言罢了。”她说。麦可张嘴，想说不是的，但是跳绳自顾自地往下跳。“所以我就跟乐蒂说：‘亲爱的，这可是你的大好机会哦！’反正我也不介意告诉你们，哈尔可以教给她的，当在我二十倍以上。乐蒂的聪明远在我之上，将来似乎会达到荒地女巫那种等级的，只不过，她会是‘好’的那种女巫。乐蒂是个好女孩，我很喜欢她。如果潘思德曼太太仍在教学的话，我会马上就送乐蒂过去。但是她已经退休了，所以我跟乐蒂说：‘哈尔巫师来追求你，再也没有比这更好的事了，跟他恋爱，然后让他来教你。你们这一对将很有不凡的成就。’乐蒂刚开始有点排斥，但最近好多了。今天看来则进行得相当顺利的样子。”">查看中文翻译</div>
