<div class="line_en">There was no thought of a fight. Even if the dwarves had not been in such a state that they were actually glad to be captured, their small knives, the only weapons they had, would have been of no use against the arrows of the elves that could hit a bird's eye in the dark. So they simply stopped dead and sat down and waited-all except Bilbo, who popped on his ring and slipped quickly to one side. That is why, when the elves bound the dwarves in a long line, one behind the other, and counted them, they never found or counted the hobbit.</div>

<div class="line_en">The day after the battle with the spiders Bilbo and the dwarves made one last despairing effort to find a way out before they died of hunger and thirst. They got up and staggered on in the direction which eight out of the thirteen of them guessed to be the one in which the path lay; but they never found out if they were right. Such day as there ever was in the forest was fading once more into the blackness of night, when suddenly out sprang the light of many torches all round them, like hundreds of red stars. Out leaped Wood-elves with their bows and spears and called the dwarves to halt.</div>

<div class="line_en">Across the bridge the elves thrust their prisoners, but Bilbo hesitated in the rear. He did not at all like the look of the cavern-mouth, and he only made up his mind not to desert his friends just in time to scuttle over at the heels of the last elves, before the great gates of the king closed behind them with a clang.</div>

<div class="line_en">Nor did they hear or feel him trotting along well behind their torch-light as they led off their prisoners into the forest. Each dwarf was blindfold, but that did not make much difference, for even Bilbo with the use of his eyes could not see where they were going, and neither he nor the others knew where they had started from anyway. Bilbo had all he could do to keep up with the torches, for the elves were making the dwarves go as fast as ever they could, sick and weary as they were. The king had ordered them to make haste. Suddenly the torches stopped, and the hobbit had just time to catch them up before they began to cross the bridge. This was the bridge that led across the river to the king's doors. The water flowed dark and swift and strong beneath; and at the far end were gates before the mouth of a huge cave that ran into the side of a steep slope covered with trees. There the great beeches came right down to the bank, till their feet were in the stream.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="精灵们擎着火把，领着他们的俘虏在森林中行进，一点也没有听见或感到比尔博随着火光跟在他们的身后。每个矮人都被蒙住了眼睛，不过其实蒙不蒙也没什么两样，因为即使是睁着眼睛的比尔博也弄不清他们是在朝什么方向行走，况且，他和矮人们连出发地点的方位也还一无所知呢。比尔博使尽全力方能勉强跟着火把前进。矮人们虽然又病又累，但精灵们还是毫不客气地赶着他们用最快的速度前进，因为国王命令过他们要尽快赶回。突然，火把停了下来，霍比特人在他们开始过桥之前刚好赶上了他们。这就是越过宫殿门口河流的桥梁，桥下的水又黑又深又急，桥对面是几道门，门后是一个巨大洞穴的入口，洞穴直通向一面覆满苍翠树木的山坡。坡上的山毛榉一直延伸到河岸边，直到把树根伸进河水中。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Inside the passages were lit with red torch-light, and the elf-guards sang as they marched along the twisting, crossing, and echoing paths. These were not like those of the goblin-cities; they were smaller, less deep underground, and filled with a cleaner air. In a great hall with pillars hewn out of the living stone sat the Elvenking on a chair of carven wood. On his head was a crown of berries and red leaves, for the autumn was come again. In the spring he wore a crown of woodland flowers. In his hand he held a carven staff of oak.</div>

<div class="line_en">"What have we done, O king?" said Balin, who was the eldest left. "Is it a crime to be lost in the forest, to be hungry and thirsty, to be trapped by spiders? Are the spiders your tame beasts or your pets, if killing them makes you angry?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“国王啊，我们到底做了什么？”剩下这些人中最年长的巴林问道，“在森林中迷路，又饥又渴，还堕入了蜘蛛的陷阱，这难道犯了罪吗？这些蜘蛛难道是您豢养的野兽或宠物，杀死它们便触怒了您吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Such a question of course made the king angrier than ever, and he answered: "It is a crime to wander in my realm without leave.

After all the disturbance you have made I have a right to know what brings you here, and if you will not tell me now, I will keep you all in prison until you have learned sense and manners!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这样的质问当然使国王恼怒无比，他回答道：“未经许可在我的领地里闲逛就是犯了法。你难道忘记了，你们是在我的国度里，使用我的同胞所铺设的道路吗？你们难道不是三次在森林中追逐、骚扰我的同胞，并以你们的骚动与喧哗惊醒了森林中的蜘蛛吗？在你们惹下这么多麻烦之后，我自然有权知道你们的来意，如果你们现在不愿意说，我就把你们关进牢里，一直关到你们学会讲道理和礼貌为止！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Poor Mr. Baggins-it was a weary long time that he lived in that place all alone, and always in hiding, never daring to take off his ring, hardly daring to sleep, even tucked away in the darkest and remotest corners he could find. For something to do he took to wandering about the Elvenking's palace. Magic shut the gates, but he could sometimes get out, if he was quick. Companies of the Wood-elves, sometimes with the king at their head, would from time to time ride out to hunt, or to other business in the woods and in the lands to the East. Then if Bilbo was very nimble, he could slip out just behind them; though it was a dangerous thing to do. More than once he was nearly caught in the doors, as they clashed together when the last elf passed; yet he did not dare to march among them because of his shadow (altogether thin and wobbly as it was in torchlight), or for fear of being bumped into and discovered. And when he did go out, which was not very often, he did no good. He did not wish to desert the dwarves, and indeed he did not know where in the world to go without them. He could not keep up with the hunting elves all the time they were out, so he never discovered the ways out of the wood, and was left to wander miserably in the forest, terrified of losing himself, until a chance came of returning. He was hungry too outside, for he was no hunter; but inside the caves he could pick up a living of some sort by stealing food from store or table when no one was at hand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可怜的巴金斯先生——这可真是一段漫长而又难熬的时间啊！他独自一人住在那个洞穴中，躲躲藏藏，一直不敢拿下戒指，即使是躲在最黑暗、最偏远的角落时，也几乎不敢睡觉。为了打发时间，他开始在精灵国王的宫殿中到处转悠。大门虽然被魔法封锁了，但只要他速度够快，有时候还是能出得去的。大群的森林精灵，有时在国王的带领下，会骑马出去打猎，或是去森林中和东方的平原那里办事。只要比尔博身手够灵活，他可以跟在他们身后偷溜出去，尽管这是很危险的。不止一次，他差点在最后一名精灵走出去的时候被大门夹住。但他不敢走到精灵们中间，因为他的影子（虽然在火把照耀下显得很细，而且摇摆不定）会在光线下现形。而且，他也害怕因为被撞而遭发现。在不多几次的出门经验中，他也没有什么新发现。他不愿意舍弃这些矮人，事实上，如果没有他们，他也不知道该往何处去。他不可能徒步跟上狩猎的精灵，因此从来也没能找到离开森林的路。每当他偷溜出洞穴的时候，都只能孤苦无依地在森林里面来回转悠，担心会迷路，苦苦地守候回去的机会。他不会狩猎；因此在洞外只能挨饿，而在洞里倒还能趁人不注意，靠着从仓库或桌上偷来的食物维生。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I am like a burglar that can't get away, but must go on miserably burgling the same house day after day," he thought. "This is the dreariest and dullest part of all this wretched, tiresome, uncomfortable adventure! I wish I was back in my hobbit-hole by my own warm fireside with the lamp shining!" He often wished, too, that he could get a message for help sent to the wizard, but that of course was quite impossible; and he soon realized that if anything was to be done, it would have to be done by Mr. Baggins, alone and unaided.</div>

<div class="line_en">Eventually, after a week or two of this sneaking sort of life, by watching and following the guards and taking what chances he could, he managed to find out where each dwarf was kept. He found all their twelve cells in different parts of the palace, and after a time he got to know his way about very well. What was his surprise one day to overhear some of the guards talking and to learn that there was another dwarf in prison too, in a specially deep dark place. He guessed at once, of course, that that was Thorin; and after a while he found that his guess was right. At last after many difficulties he managed to find the place when no one was about, and to have a word with the chief of the dwarves.</div>

<div class="line_en">So it was that Bilbo was able to take secretly Thorin's message to each of the other imprisoned dwarves, telling them that Thorin their chief was also in prison close at hand, and that no one was to reveal their errand to the king, not yet, nor before Thorin gave the word. For Thorin had taken heart again hearing how the hobbit had rescued his companions from the spiders, and was determined once more not to ransom himself with promises to the king of a share in the treasure, until all hope of escaping in any other way had disappeared; until in fact the remarkable Mr. Invisible Baggins (of whom he began to have a very high opinion indeed) had altogether failed to think of something clever.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="比尔博秘密地把索林的讯息传递给了每个被单独囚禁的矮人，告诉他们索林也被囚禁在附近，叫大家不要把他们此行的目的告诉国王，而大家在索林的讯息传到之前，也没有一个人招供的。这是因为，索林在听了霍比特人是如何从蜘蛛手中救出他的伙伴之后，重新振作了起来，决定顶住压力，不靠许诺给国王分一份财宝来换取自己的自由，除非所有逃跑的希望都已破灭，或是了不起的隐形人巴金斯先生（此时他已经对霍比特人敬佩有加了）彻底想不出聪明的计划来了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Thorin was too wretched to be angry any longer at his misfortunes, and was even beginning to think of telling the king all about his treasure and his quest (which shows how low-spirited he had become), when he heard Bilbo's little voice at his keyhole. He could hardly believe his ears. Soon however he made up his mind that he could not be mistaken, and he came to the door and had a long whispered talk with the hobbit on the other side.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="索林情绪沮丧，已经连对自己的不幸发怒的劲头儿都没有了，甚至已经开始考虑要把宝藏和探险的事对国王和盘托出了（由此可见他的情绪有多低落），而就在这时，他从钥匙孔里听见了比尔博细小的声音。他简直不敢相信自己的耳朵，然而没过多久他就确定了自己没有弄错。他走到门口，用压低的声音与门另一边的霍比特人说了半天的话。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The other dwarves quite agreed when they got the message. They all thought their own shares in the treasure (which they quite regarded as theirs, in spite of their plight and the still unconquered dragon) would suffer seriously if the Wood-elves claimed part of it, and they all trusted Bilbo. Just what Gandalf had said would happen, you see. Perhaps that was part of his reason for going off and leaving them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="其他的矮人在接到讯息后都对此表示同意。他们都觉得，如果被森林精灵占去一部分的话，自己的那一份宝藏（虽然他们此时身处困境，而且还有恶龙等着要征服，但他们已经认定宝藏是属于自己的了）一定会大幅缩水，再说他们全都十分信任比尔博。瞧，甘道夫所预言的果然发生了吧！或许这也正是他离开他们的原因所在。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Bilbo, however, did not feel nearly so hopeful as they did. He did not like being depended on by everyone, and he wished he had the wizard at hand. But that was no use: probably all the dark distance of Mirkwood lay between them. He sat and thought and thought, until his head nearly burst, but no bright idea would come. One invisible ring was a very fine thing, but it was not much good among fourteen. But of course, as you have guessed, he did rescue his friends in the end, and this is how it happened.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="比尔博呢，他一点儿也没有矮人们那样对未来充满希望。他并不喜欢被所有人倚赖的感觉，他希望巫师能在身边。不过，这样想是没用的，他们之间说不定隔了有一整片黑森林呢！他坐下来想了又想，脑袋都快想爆了也没想出什么好主意来。一枚隐形戒指的确是件不错的宝物，但要靠它救出十四个人就有点不够用了。不过话又说回来了，你们肯定已经猜到了，他最后肯定救出了所有的同伴。没错，下面就是他怎么办到的过程。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One day, nosing and wandering about, Bilbo discovered a very interesting thing: the great gates were not the only entrance to the caves. A stream flowed under part of the lowest regions of the palace, and joined the Forest River some way further to the east, beyond the steep slope out of which the main mouth opened. Where this underground watercourse came forth from the hillside there was a water-gate. There the rocky roof came down close to the surface of the stream, and from it a portcullis could be dropped right to the bed of the river to prevent anyone coming in or out that way. But the portcullis was often open, for a good deal of traffic went out and in by the water-gate. If anyone had come in that way, he would have found himself in a dark rough tunnel leading deep into the heart of the hill; but at one point where it passed under the caves the roof had been cut away and covered with great oaken trapdoors. These opened upwards into the king's cellars. There stood barrels, and barrels, and barrels; for the Wood-elves, and especially their king, were very fond of wine, though no vines grew in those parts. The wine, and other goods, were brought from far away, from their kinsfolk in the South, or from the vineyards of Men in distant lands.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有一天，比尔博正在四处探看的时候，发现了一件非常有趣的事情：施了魔法的大门并非是洞穴的惟一入口。在宫殿地势最低的地方有一条河流流过，最后越过入口处的斜坡，在东方和密林河汇流，而在这道地下水流出洞穴的地方有个水门。那里的洞顶十分低矮，和水面挨得很近，在那儿装了可以直落河床的铁闸门，以防有任何人从这里进出宫殿。不过，这道铁闸门经常是开着的，因为这里是他们的交通要道。如果有任何人从这一边进来，他会发现自己身处在一段黑暗粗糙、直通地底的隧道。不过在隧道经过洞穴下方的某处，隧道的顶上被凿开，装了结实的橡木活板门，一直向上通到国王的酒窖，那里放的除了酒桶还是酒桶。因为森林精灵们，尤其是他们的国王非常喜欢喝葡萄酒，而他们住的这一地区没有种植任何葡萄，葡萄酒和其他的货物，都是从很远的地方运来的，来自他们南方的同胞，或是遥远平原上的人类酒庄。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When the barrels were empty the elves cast them through the trapdoors, opened the water-gate, and out the barrels floated on the stream, bobbing along, until they were carried by the current to a place far down the river where the bank jutted out, near to the very eastern edge of Mirkwood. There they were collected and tied together and floated back to Lake-town, which stood close to the point where the Forest River flowed into the Long Lake.</div>

<div class="line_en">Hiding behind one of the largest barrels Bilbo discovered the trapdoors and their use, and lurking there, listening to the talk of the king's servants, he learned how the wine and other goods came up the rivers, or over land, to the Long Lake. It seemed a town of Men still throve there, built out on bridges far into the water as a protection against enemies of all sorts, and especially against the dragon of the Mountain. From Lake-town the barrels were brought up the Forest River. Often they were just tied together like big rafts and poled or rowed up the stream; sometimes they were loaded on to flat boats.</div>

<div class="line_en">When he heard this Bilbo was all in a flutter, for he saw that luck was with him and he had a chance at once to try his desperate plan. He followed the two elves, until they entered a small cellar and sat down at a table on which two large flagons were set. Soon they began to drink and laugh merrily. Luck of an unusual kind was with Bilbo then. It must be potent wine to make a wood-elf drowsy; but this wine, it would seem, was the heady vintage of the great gardens of Dorwinion, not meant for his soldiers or his servants, but for the king's feasts only, and for smaller bowls not for the butler's great flagons.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="闻听此言，比尔博不由得心头一阵猛跳，因为他发现好运果然还是跟着他的，他马上就有机会来试一试他那个铤而走险的计划了。他跟着这两名精灵，看到他们走进一个地窖，在桌边坐了下来，桌上放着两个大杯子。很快，两个人就有说有笑地喝起酒来。当时跟着比尔博的运气还不是一般的好，因为只有非常有劲的酒才能够让森林精灵喝醉，而这桶酒看来是产自多温尼安大酒庄的葡萄酒，很容易上头，不是平常给仆人和士兵喝的淡酒，而是专供国王宴会上用的，需用小杯啜饮，不能用总管的大杯牛饮。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">First he unlocked Balin's door, and locked it again carefully as soon as the dwarf was outside.

<div class="line_en">Very soon the chief guard nodded his head, then he laid it on the table and fell fast asleep. The butler went on talking and laughing to himself for a while without seeming to notice, but soon his head too nodded to the table, and he fell asleep and snored beside his friend. Then in crept the hobbit. Very soon the chief guard had no keys, but Bilbo was trotting as fast as he could along the passages towards the cells. The great bunch seemed very heavy to his arms, and his heart was often in his mouth, in spite of his ring, for he could not prevent the keys from making every now and then a loud clink and clank, which put him all in a tremble.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没过多久，守卫队长就开始耷头耷脑了，最后趴在桌上睡死过去了。总管根本没注意到对方，继续在那里说着笑着，但不久他的脑袋也聋拉到了桌上，后来他也睡着了，靠在他朋友身边打起鼾来。霍比特人悄悄溜了进去，队长身上的钥匙立刻就到了他手里，比尔博沿着过道飞快地朝各处牢房奔去。这一大堆钥匙坠得他胳膊沉甸甸的，即使比尔博戴着戒指，他还是感到提心吊胆的，因为钥匙时不时地会不可避免地互相撞击，发出“叮铃当啷”的声响，每次都把比尔博吓得浑身一震。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then off he went from door to door, until his following had grown to twelve-none of them any too nimble, what with the dark, and what with their long imprisonment. Bilbo's heart thumped every time one of them bumped into another, or grunted or whispered in the dark. "Drat this dwarvish racket!" he said to himself. But all went well, and they met no guards. As a matter of fact there was a great autumn feast in the woods that night, and in the halls above. Nearly all the king's folk were merrymaking.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后，他就一个接一个地把伙伴们救了出来，最后，他的身后聚齐了十二个人——大家的动作都有点木，那是因为他们置身黑暗，长期处于监禁之中。每当他们之中有人在黑暗中撞到了别人，或是咕哝和小声说话，比尔博的心就评评直跳。“这些爱吵吵的死矮人！”他自言自语道。不过一切进行顺利，一路上没有遇到任何守卫。事实上，那天晚上在外面的森林和上面的大厅里都在举行盛大的宴会，国王几乎所有的手下都在饮酒作乐。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Bilbo saw that the time had come to explain his idea, as far as he could; but he did not feel at all sure how the dwarves would take it. His fears were quite justified, for they did not like it a bit, and started grumbling loudly in spite of their danger.</div>

<div class="line_en">"We shall be bruised and battered to pieces, and drowned too, for certain!" they muttered. "We thought you had got some sensible notion, when you managed to get hold of the keys. This is a mad idea!"</div>

<div class="line_en">"Very well!" said Bilbo very downcast, and also rather annoyed. "Come along back to your nice cells, and I will lock you all in again, and you can sit there comfortably and think of a better plan-but I don't suppose I shall ever get hold of the keys again, even if I feel inclined to try."</div>

<div class="line_en">That was too much for them, and they calmed down. In the end, of course, they had to do just what Bilbo suggested, because it was obviously impossible for them to try and find their way into the upper halls, or to fight their way out of gates that closed by magic; and it was no good grumbling in the passages until they were caught again. So following the hobbit, down into the lowest cellars they crept. They passed a door through which the chief guard and the butler could be seen still happily snoring with smiles upon their faces. The wine of Dorwinion brings deep and pleasant dreams. There would be a different expression on the face of the chief guard next day, even though Bilbo, before they went on, stole in and kind-heartedly put the keys back on his belt.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这可是他们所不能接受的，因此他们全都冷静了下来。最后，他们当然还是只能遵照比尔博的建议去做，因为要想从上面的宫殿里逃脱显然是不可能的，从用魔法封印的大门杀出去也不可能。在通道里抱怨个不停，然后被人再抓回去，这对谁都没好处。所以，他们就跟着霍比特人，悄悄地潜入最底下的酒窖。他们经过一扇门，从门缝朝里看去，依旧可以看见总管和队长挂着微笑，开心地打着鼾熟睡着。多温尼安的葡萄酒给他们带来了深深的好梦。不过估计守卫队长的脸上到了第二天就会挂上截然不同的表情了，尽管比尔博在离开之前好心地偷溜回去，把钥匙挂回了队长的腰带。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Balin was told off to watch the guard and the butler and give warning if they stirred. The rest went into the adjoining cellar with the trapdoors. There was little time to lose. Before long, as Bilbo knew, some elves were under orders to come down and help the butler get the empty barrels through the doors into the stream. These were in fact already standing in rows in the middle of the floor waiting to be pushed off. Some of them were wine-barrels, and these were not much use, as they could not easily be opened at the end without a deal of noise, nor could they easily be secured again. But among them were several others, which had been used for bringing other stuffs, butter, apples, and all sorts of things, to the king's palace.</div>

<div class="line_en">They soon found thirteen with room enough for a dwarf in each. In fact some were too roomy, and as they climbed in the dwarves thought anxiously of the shaking and the bumping they would get inside, though Bilbo did his best to find straw and other stuff to pack them in as cosily as could be managed in a short time. At last twelve dwarves were stowed. Thorin had given a lot of trouble, and turned and twisted in his tub and grumbled like a large dog in a small kennel; while Balin, who came last, made a great fuss about his air-holes and said he was stifling, even before his lid was on. Bilbo had done what he could to close holes in the sides of the barrels, and to fix on all the lids as safely as could be managed, and now he was left alone again, running round putting the finishing touches to the packing, and hoping against hope that his plan would come off.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was just at this moment that Bilbo suddenly discovered the weak point in his plan. Most likely you saw it some time ago and have been laughing at him; but I don't suppose you would have done half as well yourselves in his place. Of course he was not in a barrel himself, nor was there anyone to pack him in, even if there had been a chance! It looked as if he would certainly lose his friends this time (nearly all of them had already disappeared through the dark trap-door), and get utterly left behind and have to stay lurking as a permanent burglar in the elf-caves for ever. For even if he could have escaped through the upper gates at once, he had precious small chance of ever finding the dwarves again. He did not know the way by land to the place where the barrels were collected. He wondered what on earth would happen to them without him; for he had not had time to tell the dwarves all that he had learned, or what he had meant to do, once they were out of the wood.</div>

Though his ears were full of water, he could hear the elves still singing in the cellar above. Then suddenly the trap-doors fell to with a boom and their voices faded away. He was in the dark tunnel floating in icy water, all alone-for you cannot count friends that are all packed up in barrels.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一通折腾后他又冒出头来，像老鼠一样攀住了木桶，可不管他怎么努力，就是无法爬到桶上面去。每次他刚一开始用力，木桶就滚动起来，又把他压到了水里。这只桶真的是空的，因此像只软木塞一样浮在水面上。虽然他的耳朵里都是水，但还是可以听见精灵们在上面的酒窖中唱着歌。接着，那门轰的一声朝下打开，歌声随即消失。他置身黑暗的隧道之中，漂浮在冰冷的河水中，孤单单的一个人——之所以没把他的朋友们算在内，是因为他们全都是待在桶里的，比他要好过许多。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now the very last barrel was being rolled to the doors! In despair and not knowing what else to do, poor little Bilbo caught hold of it and was pushed over the edge with it. Down into the water he fell, splash! into the cold dark water with the barrel on top of him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在，最后一个桶也已经滚到活板门口！可怜的比尔博在绝望和无奈之下抓住了木桶，和木桶一起被推下了活板门。扑通一声，他掉进了冰冷而又黑暗的水中，木桶一转，变成压在了他身上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Very soon a grey patch came in the darkness ahead. He heard the creak of the water-gate being hauled up, and he found that he was in the midst of a bobbing and bumping mass of casks and tubs all pressing together to pass under the arch and get out into the open stream. He had as much as he could do to prevent himself from being hustled and battered to bits; but at last the jostling crowd began to break up and swing off, one by one, under the stony arch and away. Then he saw that it would have been no good even if he had managed to get astride his barrel, for there was no room to spare, not even for a hobbit, between its top and the suddenly stooping roof where the gate was.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不久，前方的黑暗中出现了一块灰色的亮光，他听见水门吱吱嘎嘎升起的声音，同时也发现自己正身处在一大堆翻滚跳跃着的各式木桶之间，这些木桶挤在一起，要经过出口处的拱形门，这样才能来到外面露天的河面上。他竭尽全力地躲闪着，不让自己被这些桶给撞成碎片。但到最后，拥挤的一大堆开始散开，一个一个地经过石头拱门朝外漂去。这时，他才发现，即使自己刚刚爬上了木桶也只是白费力气，因为隧道的高度到了拱门处突然降得很低，在它和木桶的顶端之间根本没有多少空间，哪怕是身材瘦小的霍比特人也过不去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I do hope I put the lids on tight enough!" he thought, but before long he was worrying too much about himself to remember the dwarves. He managed to keep his head above the water, but he was shivering with the cold, and he wondered if he would die of it before the luck turned, and how much longer he would be able to hang on, and whether he should risk the chance of letting go and trying to swim to the bank.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“希望我把盖子盖得够牢！”他想，但不久之后，他就自身难保，没空再去顾及这些矮人了。他勉强把头保持在水面上，但冰凉的河水让他全身发抖。他不知道在运气转好之前自己是否就会被冻死，自己还能像这样再支撑多久，又应不应该冒险放掉木桶，然后游到岸上去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The luck turned all right before long: the eddying current carried several barrels close ashore at one point and there for a while they stuck against some hidden root. Then Bilbo took the opportunity of scrambling up the side of his barrel while it was held steady against another. Up he crawled like a drowned rat, and lay on the top spread out to keep the balance as best he could. The breeze was cold but better than the water, and he hoped he would not suddenly roll off again when they started off once more.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="运气没过多久就转好了：打着旋的水流在某个点上把几个木桶冲到靠近岸边的地方，有那么一会儿它们被藏在水下的树根给抵住了。这时，比尔博瞅准机会，趁着木桶互相顶在一起比较稳定的时候，爬到了木桶上面。他浑身湿透地趴在桶上，手脚伸开，尽力保持着平衡。微风虽然也有点凛冽，但总比河水好多了。他希望自己在木桶重新开始航程的时候，不会突然又滚下去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Out they went under the overhanging branches of the trees on either bank. Bilbo wondered what the dwarves were feeling and whether a lot of water was getting into their tubs. Some of those that bobbed along by him in the gloom seemed pretty low in the water, and he guessed that these had dwarves inside.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="出了拱门之后，他们在两岸低拂的树枝底下漂流。比尔博不知道其他的矮人此刻感觉如何，是不是有很多水渗进他们的木桶里头？有些漂近他身边的木桶看来吃水相当深，他猜这多半是装着矮人的桶。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In this way at last Mr. Baggins came to a place where the trees on either hand grew thinner. He could see the paler sky between them. The dark river opened suddenly wide, and there it was joined to the main water of the Forest River flowing down in haste from the king's great doors. There was a dim sheet of water no longer overshadowed, and on its sliding surface there were dancing and broken reflections of clouds and of stars. Then the hurrying water of the Forest River swept all the company of casks and tubs away to the north bank, in which it had eaten out a wide bay. This had a shingly shore under hanging banks and was walled at the eastern end by a little jutting cape of hard rock. On the shallow shore most of the barrels ran aground, though a few went on to bump against the stony pier.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就这样，巴金斯先生终于来到了一处两旁树木都比较稀疏的地方，他看见树木之间的天空比在森林里时要苍白了许多，黑暗的河流突然间变得开阔了，并且和国王洞穴大门前流出的密林河交汇到了一起。这里的河面虽然还有点黯淡，但已经不再为阴影所笼罩，光滑的水面上居然跃动着云朵和星光残缺的倒影。然后，密林河的急流又将所有木桶冲到了北岸，在那里有一整片冲积出来的沙洲，东边则是由一整块岩石作为屏障，阻挡了河水的流动。大部分木桶都被冲上了这个沙滩，只有几只继续向着巨岩撞去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Before long the barrels broke free again and turned and twisted off down the stream, and out into the main current. Then he found it quite as difficult to stick on as he had feared; but he managed it somehow, though it was miserably uncomfortable. Luckily he was very light, and the barrel was a good big one and being rather leaky had now shipped a small amount of water. All the same it was like trying to ride, without bridle or stirrups, a round-bellied pony that was always thinking of rolling on the grass.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不一会儿，木桶相互散开，打了几个转以后，又开始沿河而下，并且进入了主流之中。这时比尔博发现，要保持身体的平衡果然和他所想的一样困难，但他还是勉强办到了，只是身体姿势相当不舒服。幸运的是，他身体很轻，而木桶也够大，再加上有点漏，里面已经装了一点水，因此重心还算稳。这种感觉就像是在骑一匹没有马鞍和马镫又肚皮滚圆的小马，而小马还时时刻刻想要在草地上打滚儿。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There were people on the look-out on the banks. They quickly poled and pushed all the barrels together into the shallows, and when they had counted them they roped them together and left them till the morning. Poor dwarves! Bilbo was not badly off now. He slipped from his barrel and waded ashore, and then sneaked along to some huts that he could see near the water's edge. He no longer thought twice about picking up a supper uninvited if he got the chance, he had been obliged to do it for so long, and he knew now only too well what it was to be really hungry, not merely politely interested in the dainties of a well-filled larder. Also he had caught a glimpse of a fire through the trees, and that appealed to him with his dripping and ragged clothes clinging to him cold and clammy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两边岸上都有人在守望，他们很快用杆子将木桶收拢到一处，点完数后用绳子扎起来，然后等明天早上再来处理。可怜的矮人们啊！比尔博现在的境况已经比之前好多了。他从木桶上溜下来，涉水来到岸上，又偷偷来到了岸边的屋子，那是他在水边就能看到的。只要有机会，他会毫不犹豫、不邀自来地吃上一顿晚餐。他处于这种难以忍受的状态已经很久了，彻底地领教了饥饿的滋味。所以现在的他已是饥不择食，不会对食品储藏室中装得满满的美味仅仅表示出礼貌的兴趣。透过一片小树林他还发现了一堆营火，这对于穿着破衣烂衫，浑身湿答答的他来说，真是十分诱人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There is no need to tell you much of his adventures that night, for now we are drawing near the end of the eastward journey and coming to the last and greatest adventure, so we must hurry on. Of course helped by his magic ring he got on very well at first, but he was given away in the end by his wet footsteps and the trail of drippings that he left wherever he went or sat; and also he began to snivel, and wherever he tried to hide he was found out by the terrific explosions of his suppressed sneezes. Very soon there was a fine commotion in the village by the riverside; but Bilbo escaped into the woods carrying a loaf and a leather bottle of wine and a pie that did not belong to him. The rest of the night he had to pass wet as he was and far from a fire, but the bottle helped him to do that, and he actually dozed a little on some dry leaves, even though the year was getting late and the air was chilly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这里就不需要再跟大家详细描述他当晚的经历了，因为东行的旅程已经接近尾声，冒险来到了最后也是最刺激的部分，所以我们必须加快一点讲故事的进度才行。当然，凭着戒指的帮助，他一开始进展顺利，但到了最后，由于他无论走到哪里或坐在哪里都会留下水滴和湿湿的脚印，所以他被这些印迹给出卖了。何况他又开始打喷嚏了，不管他躲到哪里，最后都会因为他那捂着的喷嚏声像爆炸一样响而被人发现。很快，这座河边的村庄就陷入了一场骚动，不过，比尔博还是带着不属于他的一条面包、一皮囊的酒和一个派逃进了森林。在夜晚剩下的时间里，他都无法再靠近任何火堆，只能湿答答地度过，不过那瓶酒帮他渡过了难关。事实上，他那晚还躺在一些干树叶上打了个瞌睡呢，尽管季节已经快来到了冬季，晚上的天气已经颇有些寒意了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He woke again with a specially loud sneeze. It was already grey morning, and there was a merry racket down by the river. They were making up a raft of barrels, and the raft-elves would soon be steering it off down the stream to Lake-town. Bilbo sneezed again. He was no longer dripping but he felt cold all over. He scrambled down as fast as his stiff legs would take him and managed just in time to get on to the mass of casks without being noticed in the general bustle. Luckily there was no sun at the time to cast an awkward shadow, and for a mercy he did not sneeze again for a good while.</div>
