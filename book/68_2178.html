<div class="line_en">The Doctor was surprised, and even a little disappointed, to see that Catherine did not appear to be angry or upset about what had happened. He wanted to be kind to her, but she did not seem to want or need his kindness.</div>

<div class="line_en">He never asked her whether she had seen Morris again. She had, in fact, not seen him; she had only written him a long letter. "I am in great trouble," she wrote. "Do not doubt my love for you, but let me wait a little and think." But her thoughts were not at all clear. She could not really believe that her father would change his mind about Morris; she just hoped that in some mysterious way the situation would get better. Meanwhile, she felt she must try to be a good daughter, to be patient, and to search for a peaceful way out of their difficulty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他从没问过她有没有再见过莫里斯。实际上，她没再见到他；只给他写过一封长信。“我现在麻烦很大，”她写道，“不要怀疑我对你的爱，但让我等一等并想一下。”但她一点儿头绪都没有。她不能真的相信她父亲会改变对莫里斯的看法；她只是希望这种局面会奇迹般地好转。同时，她觉得自己必须努力做个好女儿，要有耐心，还要寻求一个和平摆脱困境的方法。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She received no help from her aunt in this search. Mrs Penniman was enjoying all the excitement of the romance and had no sensible advice to offer poor Catherine. "You must act, my dear," she said. "The important thing is to act."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她没有从姑姑那里寻求到任何帮助。彭尼曼夫人喜欢浪漫故事中所有激动人心的事情，可是她却不能给可怜的凯瑟琳提出任何明智的建议。“你必须采取行动，亲爱的，”她说，“重要的是行动。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mrs Penniman had also written to Morris, and had arranged to meet him secretly in a café on the other side of the city. She had not told her niece about this meeting, and so was a little embarrassed when Morris arrived and asked if she had a message for him from Catherine.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="彭尼曼夫人也给莫里斯写了信，并且安排在城市另一头的一家咖啡厅里和他秘密见面。她没有告诉侄女这次会面的事情，所以当莫里斯到了之后问她有没有凯瑟琳给他的口信时，她有些尴尬。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="有那么一会儿，凯瑟琳盯着炉火一动不动。然后她抬起头看着姑姑。“为什么您把事情弄得这么令我为难？”她问道，“我觉得您并不理解我，也不了解我。您最好别再和汤森先生碰面了。我认为这样不对。我父亲要是知道了会不喜欢的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
