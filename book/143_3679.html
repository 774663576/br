<div class="line_en">It was then that he saw Aspanu Pisciotta drag Turi Guiliano through the monastery gates. The gatekeeper tried to keep them out, but Pisciotta put a pistol to his tonsured head and he fell to his knees to say his last prayers. Pisciotta deposited Guiliano's bloody, almost lifeless, body at the Abbot's feet.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Abbot was a tall, emaciated man with an elegant monkey-like face, all tiny bones, a nub of a nose and querying little brown buttons for eyes. Though seventy years of age, he was vigorous, his mind as sharp and cunning as in the old days before Mussolini, when he had written elegant ransom notes for Mafia kidnappers who employed him.</div>

<div class="line_en">The abbot made his evening tour of the Franciscan monastery, spurring his lazy, good-for-nothing monks to earn their daily bread. He checked the bins in the holy relic workshop and visited the bakery turning out huge crusty loaves for nearby towns. He inspected the produce garden and the bamboo baskets filled to the brim with olives, tomatoes and grapes, looking for bruises on their satiny skins. His monks were all as busy as elves -- though not so merry. In fact they were a sullen crew, with none of the joy necessary to serve God. The Abbot took a long black cheroot from beneath his cassock and strolled around the monastery grounds to sharpen his appetite for the evening meal.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="圣方济各会修道院的院长正在进行晚间巡视，督促那些偷懒、无能的修道士们干活。他检查了圣物作坊的仓库，检查了为附近几个镇供应硬皮面包的面包房。他观察了农产品园，检查了装满橄榄、西红柿、葡萄的竹筐，看它们光滑的表面上有没有伤痕。修道士们个个忙得像小精灵，但却不像小精灵那么开心。实际上他们很沉闷，丝毫没有为上帝效劳必须具备的愉悦感。院长从长袍里掏出一根长长的黑色方头雪茄，在修道院内四处漫步，这样到吃晚饭时能有个好胃口。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Now though it was known to all, peasants and authorities alike, that his monastery was the headquarters of black market operators and smugglers, he was never interfered with in his illegal activities. This out of respect for his holy calling, and a feeling that he deserved some material reward for his spiritual guidance to the community.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在，他的修道院是黑市操纵者和走私贩私者的大本营，这是包括农民和当局在内尽人皆知的，但是他的非法活动却从来无人干预。因为他是神职人员，人们觉得他为这个地区提供了精神指导，得到一些物质回报是理所当然的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Abbot reassured the gatekeeper monk, then said to Pisciotta, "Well, my dear Aspanu, what mischief are you into now?"

<div class="line_en">He looked the Abbot straight in the eye. He wanted to convey a message that would not be a direct threat but would make the priest understand that if he refused he would make a mortal enemy. "This is my cousin and dearest friend, Salvatore Guiliano," Pisciotta said. "As you can see, he has been unfortunate, and in a short time the National Police will be all over the mountains looking for him. And for me. You are our only hope. I beg you to hide us, and send for a doctor. Do this for me and you have a friend forever." He emphasized the word "friend."</div>

<div class="line_en">None of this escaped the Abbot. He understood perfectly. He had heard of this young Guiliano, a brave boy well respected in Montelepre, a great shooter and hunter, manlier than his years. Even the Friends of the Friends had their eyes on him as a possible recruit. The great Don Croce himself, on a social and business visit to the monastery, had mentioned his name to the Abbot as someone it might be profitable to cultivate.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="院长仔细地听着他所说的每一句话。他完全明白。他曾经听说过吉里安诺是个勇敢的年轻人，在蒙特莱普雷颇受尊敬，善于射击和捕猎，而且少年老成。就连黑手党也对他另眼相看，认为他是一个可以招募的对象。唐·克罗切有一次到修道院来进行社交和事务访问时，曾对院长提起过他，说经过调教他可能成为很有用的人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But studying the unconscious Guiliano, he was almost sure that this man would need a grave rather than sanctuary, a priest to administer the last rites rather than a doctor. There was very little risk in granting Pisciotta's request, giving sanctuary to a corpse was not a crime even in Sicily. But he did not want to let this young man know that the favor he was about to do had such little value. He said, "And why are they searching for you?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他仔细看了看这个昏迷不醒的年轻人，几乎可以断定这个人需要的不是藏身之地，而是葬身之地；需要的不是医生，而是为他进行最后祈祷的神父。答应皮肖塔的这个请求几乎无需冒任何风险，因为即使在西西里，把一具尸体藏起来也不算犯法。但是他不想让这个年轻人知道，他帮这个忙几乎毫无价值。他问：“他们为什么要搜捕你们呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Abbot lowered his eyes in sorrow for another soul lost to hell and to study closely Guiliano's unconscious form. Blood was leaking through the shirt tied around his body. Perhaps the poor lad would die as they talked, and solve the whole problem.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="院长垂下眼皮，为那个下了地狱的灵魂感到痛苦。他仔细地检查了昏迷不醒的吉里安诺。扎了衬衣的伤口还在往外渗血。也许就在他们说话的时候，这个可怜的年轻人就会死去，这样一来所有问题就会一了百了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Pisciotta hesitated. If the Abbott knew that a policeman was dead he might refuse them sanctuary. But if he were unprepared for the search that was sure to come, he might be surprised into betraying them. He decided to tell the truth. He did so very quickly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="皮肖塔有些犹豫。如果院长知道死了一名警察，就有可能拒绝向他们提供藏身之地。但是如果他对即将到来的搜捕行动毫无准备，他可能感到震惊并出卖他们。皮肖塔决定把事情原原本本地告诉他，于是很快把事情的经过说了一遍。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As a Franciscan monk, the Abbot was filled with Christian charity, but in these terrible times he had to consider the practical and material consequences of his merciful deeds. If he gave sanctuary and the boy died, he could only come out with a profit. The authorities would be satisfied with the corpse, the family would be forever in his debt. If Guiliano recovered, his gratitude might be even more valuable. A man who could, while grievously wounded, still fire his pistol and kill a policeman was a man worth having in your debt.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="作为圣方济各会的修士，院长不乏基督教的博爱之心，可是在这种可怕的岁月里，他不得不考虑这种恻隐之心可能带来实际的物质上的后果。如果他提供了庇护但这个年轻人还是死了，结果只会对他有好处。当局只要见到他的尸体就满足了，而他的家人也会对他感激不尽。如果吉里安诺能够康复，他的感恩之情也许更有价值。如果一个人受了重伤还能开枪打死警察，卖给他一个人情是非常值得的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He could of course deliver both of these rascals to the National Police, who would then make short work of them. But what would be the profit? The authorities could do no more for him than they were doing now. The area in which they held power was already secure to him. It was on the other side of the fence he needed friends. Betraying these youngsters would only earn him enemies among the peasants and the undying hatred of two families. The Abbot was not so foolish as to think his cassock could protect him from the vendetta that would surely follow, and also he had read Pisciotta's mind; this was a young fellow who would go far before he trod the road to hell. No, the hatred of the peasant Sicilian could never be taken lightly. True Christians, they would never shame a statue of the Virgin Mary, but in the hot blood of vendetta they would shotgun the Pope himself for breaking omerta, the ancient code of silence to any authority. In this land with its countless statues of Jesus, there was no belief in the doctrine of turning the other cheek. In this benighted land "forgiveness" was the refuge of the coward. The Sicilian peasant did not know the meaning of mercy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当然他也可以把这两个小坏蛋交给警察，警察很快就会把他们处死。那样有什么好处呢？当局对他不会比现在更好。他们现在掌权的这个地区对他来说早就很安全了，他需要的是篱笆墙另一侧的朋友。出卖这两个年轻人只能使他在农民中树敌，并与这两家人结仇。院长还不至于愚蠢到这种地步，认为他这件法衣能保护他免受必然会随之而来的仇杀。此外，他也看透了皮肖塔，这个年轻人还要走很远才能踏上通往地狱之路。不，决不能对西西里农民的仇恨掉以轻心。他们是真正的基督教徒，永远不会亵渎圣母玛利亚的雕像，可是如果为了复仇，他们会用短筒猎枪打死违反“缄默规则”的教皇。任何人都必须遵守这种保持缄默的古老规则。在这片土地上有许许多多耶稣像，但是谁也不相信打不还手，“宽恕”是懦夫的借口，西西里农民不知道什么叫怜悯。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Of one thing he was sure. Pisciotta would never betray him. In one of their little smuggling deals, the Abbot had arranged for Pisciotta to be arrested and interrogated. The interrogator, a member of the Palermo Security Police, not one of the carabinieri blockheads, had been subtle and then blunt. But neither cunning nor cruelty had moved Pisciotta. He had remained silent. The interrogator released him and assured the Abbot that this was a lad who could be trusted with more important errands. Since then the Abbot had always held a special place in his heart for Aspanu Pisciotta and often said a prayer for his soul.</div>

That centuries ago the Normans had painted their houses white, the Greeks always used blue, the Arabs various pinks and red. And the Jews used yellow.

At night there was a great deal of gambling and drunkenness, and even women were smuggled in, but to all this the Abbot closed his eyes. "These are hard times," he said to Guiliano.

<div class="line_en">One rainy afternoon, the Abbot showed Turi another wing of the monastery which was used as a warehouse. This was overflowing with holy relics manufactured by a skilled team of old monks. The Abbot, like any shopkeeper, bewailed hard times. "Before the war, we had a very good business," he sighed. "This warehouse was never more than half full. And just look what sacred treasures we have here. A bone from the fish multiplied by Christ. The staff carried by Moses on his way to the Promised Land." He paused to watch Guiliano's astonished face with amused satisfaction. Then his bony face contorted into a wicked grin. Kicking a huge pile of wooden sticks, he said almost gleefully, "This used to be our best item. Hundreds of pieces of the cross on which our Lord was crucified. And in this bin are fragments of any saint you can name. There isn't a household in Sicily that doesn't have the bone of a saint. And locked away in a special storeroom we have thirteen arms of Saint Andrew, three heads of John the Baptist and seven suits of armor worn by Joan of Arc.

We too have families and must aid and protect them. Many of our monks are poor and come from the poor, who we know are the salt of the earth. We cannot permit our sisters and brothers, our nephews and cousins to starve in these hard times. The Holy Church itself needs our help, must defend itself against powerful enemies. The Communists and Socialists, those misguided liberals, must be fought against, and that takes money. What a comfort to Mother Church are the faithful! Their need for our holy relics supplies the money to crush the infidels and fills a need in their own souls. If we did not supply them they would waste their money on gambling and wine and shameful women. Don't you agree?"</div>

Could it possibly be a forgery? The Abbot patted him kindly on the shoulder and told him the monastery had been making replicas for over a hundred years carved from good olive wood.

<div class="line_en">The Abbot was pleased and all his affection returned. This was a fine fellow, he had enjoyed his company the past few months, and it was comforting to know that the man was deeply in his debt. And he would not be ungrateful; he had already shown a noble heart. He expressed in word and deed, every day, his respect and gratitude to the Abbot. He did not have the hard heart of an outlaw. What would happen to such a man in this present-day Sicily, full of informers, poverty, bandits, and sundry sinners? Ah, well, the Abbot thought, a man who has murdered once can do it again, in a pinch. The Abbot decided that Don Croce should counsel Turi Guiliano on the right path to life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="院长高兴起来，慈爱随之回归。这小伙子不错，在过去几个月里，他很喜欢他的陪伴，他心里感到宽慰，因为图里欠他很大的人情，他决不会不知感激。他早就表现出高尚的心灵，而且每天都用语言和行动表明他对院长的尊重和感激。他不像歹徒那样心狠手辣。如今的西西里，穷人、告密者、强盗……各类罪人比比皆是，这个小伙子会怎么样呢？院长思忖：一个人只要杀过人，碰上同样的情况就会再次杀人。院长认为，唐·克罗切应当点化图里·吉里安诺走上正确的人生道路。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Guiliano nodded, but he was smiling. It was dazzling for one so young to meet such a master of hypocrisy. The Abbot was irritated by that smile; he had expected a more gracious response from a murderer to whom he had given sanctuary and nursed back from the gate of death. Grateful respect dictated a properly hypocritical response of the utmost sincerity. This smuggler, this murderer, this peasant, Master Turi Guiliano, should show himself more understanding, more a Christian. The Abbot said sternly, "Remember our true faith rests on our belief in miracles."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉里安诺点点头，然后微微一笑，他被这个伪善的人弄得一头雾水。院长看见他的微笑后颇感恼火，他原本以为这个杀人犯会礼貌地回应，因为他为他提供了庇护，把他从死亡的边缘拉了回来。即使出于感恩，他也应该真心作出礼貌的反应。这个走私犯、杀人犯、乡巴佬、公子哥儿图里·吉里安诺应当表现出更多的理解，更像一个基督教徒才是。院长不客气地说：“不要忘了，我们真正的信仰在于我们相信奇迹会发生。”">查看中文翻译</div>

He had an uncle of the same name who was a great Mafia chief.</div>

<div class="line_en">Pisciotta discovered that Marcuzzi made regular trips from Montelepre to Castellammare. Pisciotta knew the farmer who kept the smuggler's mules, and when he saw the animals taken out of the fields and brought to a barn near the town, he gambled that Marcuzzi was making a trip the next day. At dawn Pisciotta stationed himself along the road that he knew Marcuzzi had to take, and waited for him. He had a lupara, which many Sicilian families owned as part of their household equipment. Indeed, the deadly Sicilian shotgun was so common and so often used for assassination that when Mussolini cleaned out the Mafia, he had ordered all stone walls to be knocked down to at most three feet in height so that murderers could not use the walls as ambush points.</div>

<div class="line_en">He did not have to wait long. Because Marcuzzi was leading empty mules to pick up black market goods in Castellammare, he was careless. He rode his lead mule down a mountain trail with his rifle slung over his shoulder, instead of at the ready. When he saw Pisciotta standing in the trail in front of him, he was not alarmed. All he saw was a short slender boy with a thin dandyish mustache who was smiling in a way that irritated him.

<div class="line_en">With grim satisfaction Pisciotta stood over the body and fired another blast into the head, then took the pistol still in Marcuzzi's hand and the rifle wrapped on the body by its sling. He emptied the man's jacket pocket of rifle bullets and put them into his own. Then quickly and methodically he shot each of the four mules, a warning to anyone who might help the enemies of Guiliano, even indirectly. He stood on the road, his lupara in his arms, the dead man's rifle slung over his shoulder, the pistol in his waistband. He felt no sense of pity and his ferocity pleased him. For despite his love for his friend they had always striven against each other in many ways. And though he acknowledged Turi as his chief, he always felt he had to prove his claim to their friendship by being as courageous and as clever. Now he too had stepped out of the magic circle of boyhood, of society, and joined Turi on the outside of that circle. With this act he had bound himself forever to Turi Guiliano.</div>
