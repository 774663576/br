<div class="line_en">I have resigned. The government appears to go on much the same, but there is a spoke out of its wheel, nevertheless. I was clerk of the Senate Committee on Conchology, and I have thrown up the position. I could see the plainest disposition on the part of the other members of the government to debar me from having any voice in the counsels of the nation, and so I could no longer hold office and retain my self-respect. If I were to detail all the outrages that were heaped upon me during the six days that I was connected with the government in an official capacity, the narrative would fill a volume. They appointed me clerk of that Committee on Conchology and then allowed me no amanuensis to play billiards with. I would have borne that, lonesome as it was, if I had met with that courtesy from the other members of the Cabinet which was my due. But I did not. Whenever I observed that the head of a department was pursuing a wrong course, I laid down everything and went and tried to set him right, as it was my duty to do; and I never was thanked for it in a single instance. I went, with the best intentions in the world, to the Secretary of the Navy, and said:</div>

<div class="line_en">Then the Secretary of the Navy asked me who I was; and when I told him I was connected with the government, he wanted to know in what capacity. I said that, without remarking upon the singularity of such a question, coming, as it did, from a member of that same government, I would inform him that I was clerk of the Senate Committee on Conchology. Then there was a fine storm! He finished by ordering me to leave the premises, and give my attention strictly to my own business in future. My first impulse was to get him removed. However, that would harm others besides himself, and do me no real good, and so I let him stay.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时候，海军部长问我是什么人，我说我在政府供职，他问我是管什么的。我心想同一个政府里工作的人居然提出这样的问题，真叫人莫明其妙，但我没有说出口来，只告诉他，我是参议院贝类委员会的文书。你猜他发多大的脾气！他命令我滚出他这个地方，以后只许管我份内的事情。我头一个冲动是想撤他的职。不过，这不光是他一个人的问题，还涉及到其他人，而我又捞不到什么好处，所以才没有撤他。">查看中文翻译</div>

There is no use in a man having a whole fleet for a pleasure excursion. It is too expensive.

<div class="line_en">I went next to the Secretary of War, who was not inclined to see me at all until he learned that I was connected with the government. If I had not been on important business, I suppose I could not have got in. I asked him for alight (he was smoking at the time), and then I told him I had no fault to find with his defending the parole stipulations of General Lee and his comrades in arms, but that I could not approve of his method of fighting the Indians on the Plains. I said he fought too scattering. He ought to get the Indians more together -- get them together in some convenient place, where he could have provisions enough for both parties, and then have a general massacre. I said there was nothing so convincing to an Indian as a general massacre. If he could not approve of the massacre, I said the next surest thing for an Indian was soap and education. Soap and education are not as sudden as a massacre, but they are more deadly in the long run; because a half -- massacred Indian may recover, but if you educate him and wash him, it is bound to finish him some time or other. It undermines his constitution; it strikes at the foundation of his being. "Sir," I said, "the time has come when blood -- curdling cruelty has become necessary. Inflict soap and a spelling-book on every Indian that ravages the Plains, and let them die!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着我去找作战部部长。他压根儿不想见我，后来他知道我也在政府任职。我呢，如果没有什么要紧的事儿，我想我才不会去找他。我先问他借个火（他当时正抽着烟），接着我对他说，他维护假释李将军①及其战友们的条款，我没有什么意见，但是我不赞成他对付平原上印第安人的作战方式。我说他兵力过于分散。他应该吸住更多的印第安人——选一个有利的地形把他们集中在一起，双方都有足够的供应，然后来它个大屠杀。我说，对于印第安人来说，大屠杀最使他们心服。如果他不赞成大屠杀，我说第二个绝招是使用肥皂②和教育。肥皂和教育的效果不如大屠杀迅速，但是从长远考虑，更能致他们于死命。因为杀了一半，还剩一半，印第安人还能复原，可是如果你给他们上学，叫他们洗澡，结果他们迟早要完蛋。这个办法慢慢毁损他的体格，击中他生命基础的要害。我说：“先生，是时候了，必须残酷镇压。对破坏平原的印第安人，用肥皂和拼音本加以严惩，让他们去死吧！”①李将军（1807—1870），南北战争时期南方军队的统帅。②Soap，双关语，另有收买的意思。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I then said that I was sorry he had seen fit to change the subject so abruptly, because such conduct was very offensive to me; but under the circumstances I would overlook the matter and come to the point. I now went into an earnest expostulation with him upon the extravagant length of his report. I said it was expensive, unnecessary, and awkwardly constructed; there were no descriptive passages in it, no poetry, no sentiment no heroes, no plot, no pictures -- not even wood -- cuts. Nobody would read it, that was a clear case. I urged him not to ruin his reputation by getting out a thing like that. If he ever hoped to succeed in literature he must throw more variety into his writings. He must beware of dry detail. I said that the main popularity of the almanac was derived from its poetry and conundrums, and that a few conundrums distributed around through his Treasury report would help the sale of it more than all the internal revenue he could put into it. I said these things in the kindest spirit, and yet the Secretary of the Treasury fell into a violent passion. He even said I was an ass. He abused me in the most vindictive manner, and said that if I came there again meddling with his business he would throw me out of the window. I said I would take my hat and go, if I could not be treated with the respect due to my office, and I did go. It was just like a new author. They always think they know more than anybody else when they are getting out their first book. Nobody can tell them anything.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我说，他话题转得这么突然，我感到遗憾，这种做法令我反感。不过，在同前情况下，我不计较这件事，谈正事要紧。我接着恳切地告诫他，他作的报告长得出奇。我说作这么长的报告是浪费时间，没有必要，而且结构别扭。其中没有描写，没有诗，没有感情——没有主人公，没有情节，没有插图——连一幅木刻都没有。没有人会读这种报告，这是明摆着的事。我奉劝他不要因为写这样的报告而坏了自己的名声。如果他想在文学方面搞出点名堂来，他写的时候一定得多搞点花样。枯燥的细节绝对不能往上写。我说日历片之所以受大众欢迎，就是因为它上面有诗句，有谜语，他的财政报告要是处处插进一点谜语，销路一定更好，比他写进报告里去的国内税收项目来劲得多。我谈这些问题的时候态度十分诚恳，可是财政部长大发雷霆。他居然说我是一头蠢驴。他存心报复，咒骂了我一通，还说如果我再敢来干涉他的工作，他就把我从窗户里扔出去。我说，既然我得不到与我官差身分相称的待遇，我就取帽告辞。我这就走了。这号人活像新冒出来的作家。他们的处女作快发表了，就自以为比谁都强。你甭想对他们提什么建议。">查看中文翻译</div>

The sting of my wrongs may have driven me to unjust and harmful conclusions, but it surely seemed to me that the Secretary of State, the Secretary of War, the Secretary of the Treasury, and others of my confreres had conspired from the very beginning to drive me from the Administration. I never attended but one Cabinet meeting while I was connected with the government. That was sufficient for me. The servant at the White House door did not seem disposed to make way for me until I asked if the other members of the Cabinet had arrived. He said they had, and I entered.

<div class="line_en">I am done with official life for the present. Let those clerks who are willing to be imposed on remain. I know numbers of them in the departments who are never informed when there is to be a Cabinet meeting, whose advice is never asked about war, or finance, or commerce, by the heads of the nation, any more than if they were not connected with the government, and who actually stay in their offices day after day and work! They know their importance to the nation, and they unconsciously show it in their bearing, and the way they order their sustenance at the restaurant -- but they work. I know one who has to paste all sorts of little scraps from the newspapers into a scrapbook -- sometimes as many as eight or ten scraps a day. He doesn't do it well, but he does it as well as he can. It is very fatiguing. It is exhausting to the intellect. Yet he only gets eighteen hundred dollars a year. With a brain like his, that young man could amass thousands and thousands of dollars in some other pursuit, if he chose to do it. But no -- his heart is with his country, and he will serve her as long as she has got a scrapbook left. And I know clerks that don't know how to write very well, but such knowledge as they possess they nobly lay at the feet of their country, and toil on and suffer for twenty-five hundred dollars a year. What they write has to be written over again by other clerks sometimes; but when a man has done his best for his country, should his country complain? Then there are clerks that have no clerkships, and are waiting, and waiting, and waiting for a vacancy -- waiting patiently for a chance to help their country out -- and while they, are waiting, they only get barely two thousand dollars a year for it. It is sad it is very, very sad. When a member of Congress has a friend who is gifted, but has no employment wherein his great powers may be brought to bear, he confers him upon his country, and gives him a clerkship in a department. And there that man has to slave his life out, fighting documents for the benefit of a nation that never thinks of him, never sympathizes with him -- and all for two thousand or three thousand dollars a year. When I shall have completed my list of all the clerks in the several departments, with my statement of what they have to do, and what they get for it, you will see that there are not half enough clerks, and that what there are do not get half enough pay.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我的官场生涯眼看是完了。让那些愿意上勾的文书留下去干吧。据我了解，各部门许多文书根本不知道什么时候开内阁会议；他们对于战争、财政、商业有什么高见，国家领袖从来不去询问，好像他们不是政府里的人，而实际上他们天天在办公室干活！他们知道他们的工作对国家来说多么重要，他们一举一动不自觉地流露出来，你瞧他们在饭店里点菜时候那副神气——但他们是在工作呀。我认识一位文书，他得把从报纸上剪下来的各式各样小纸片贴到剪贴簿里去——有时候一天要贴八张、十张之多。他贴得不怎么样，可是他拿出了最大的本事去贴。这活儿是最累人的。它淘空你的才智。可是他只挣1800美元一年。那位年轻人有这么好的头脑，要是愿意干别的行当，他可以攒起好几千好几千美元。可是，他不——他的心向着祖国，只要祖国还剩下一本剪贴簿，他就甘心为祖国去贴。我认识几位文书，他们不知道怎么写，可是他们有多少知识就把多少知识尊敬地奉献在祖国的脚下，累死累活，受苦受难，就为这2500百美元的年薪。他们写的东西，有时候别的文书不得不重写，可是你已经为国家尽了力，国家还能埋怨你吗？有些文书，找不到文书的活儿，就等啊，等啊，等什么时候有个空缺——耐心地等待一个为祖国效劳的机会——而在他们等的时候，只给他们2000元一年。这可真惨——太惨了，太惨了。如果国会议员一位朋友很有才能又没有工作，无法施展他伟大的抱负，那位议员就会把他交给祖国，安排他在一个部门当文书。那个人就得当一辈子奴隶，为了从不替他考虑、从不同情他的国家的利益而同文件去开仗——就不过为了两三千元一年的薪俸。我要是把几个部门所有文书的情况统统列举出来，说明他们干的是什么活儿，拿的又是多少钱，那么，你会发现文书还差一半，就他们干的活儿说，工资也还差一半呢。">查看中文翻译</div>
