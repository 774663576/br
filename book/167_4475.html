<div class="line_en">Beside her, Brienne's misery was almost palpable. Catelyn had ordered garments sewn to her measure, handsome gowns to suit her birth and sex, yet still she preferred to dress in oddments of mail and boiled leather, a swordbelt cinched around her waist. She would have been happier riding to war with Edmure, no doubt, but even walls as strong as Riverrun's required swords to hold them. Her brother had taken every able-bodied man for the fords, leaving Ser Desmond Grell to command a garrison made up of the wounded, the old, and the sick, along with a few squires and some untrained peasant boys still shy of manhood. This, to defend a castle crammed full of women and children.</div>

<div class="line_en">Tell Father I have gone to make him proud." Her brother swung up into his saddle, every inch the lord in his bright mail and flowing mud-and-water cloak. A silver trout ornamented the crest of his greathelm, twin to the one painted on his shield.</div>

<div class="line_en">I gave Brandon my favor to wear, and never comforted Petyr once after he was wounded, nor bid him farewell when Father sent him off. And when Brandon was murdered and Father told me I must wed his brother, I did so gladly, though I never saw Ned's face until our wedding day. I gave my maidenhood to this solemn stranger and sent him off to his war and his king and the woman who bore him his bastard, because I always did my duty.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Our duty." Catelyn's face was drawn as she started across the yard. I have always done my duty, she thought. Perhaps that was why her lord father had always cherished her best of all his children. Her two older brothers had both died in infancy, so she had been son as well as daughter to Lord Hoster until Edmure was born. Then her mother had died and her father had told her that she must be the lady of Riverrun now, and she had done that too. And when Lord Hoster promised her to Brandon Stark, she had thanked him for making her such a splendid match.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们有我们的责任。”凯特琳面色沉重地穿过庭院。我总是在履行自己的责任，她心想，也许这就是爸爸把我当成他最宝贝的孩子的原因吧。她的两位兄长在幼年时代不幸夭折，所以艾德慕出生之前，霍斯特公爵一直把她当儿子看待。不久，母亲过世，父亲嘱咐她成为奔流城的主妇，而她也出色地扮演了这一角色。再后来，当霍斯特公爵告诉她，她已被许配给布兰登·史塔克时，她感谢他为自己挑选了一个般配的对象。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Her steps took her to the sept, a seven-sided sandstone temple set amidst her mother's gardens and filled with rainbow light. It was crowded when they entered; Catelyn was not alone in her need for prayer. She knelt before the painted marble image of the Warrior and lit a scented candle for Edmure and another for Robb off beyond the hills. Keep them safe and help them to victory, she prayed, and bring peace to the souls of the slain and comfort to those they leave behind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她信步走到圣堂门前，它矗立在母亲的花园里，由七面砂墙砌成，映照着七色光芒。她们进入时，里面已挤满了人，看来凯特琳并非惟一渴望祈祷的人。她跪在战士的大理石彩绘雕像前，为艾德慕点上一根香烛，为山那边的罗柏也点了一根。请保佑他们平安，帮助他们获得胜利吧，她祷告，并将和平之心带给杀戮的灵魂，让长眠于地下的人们终得安息。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The septon entered with his censer and crystal while she was at her prayers, so Catelyn lingered for the celebration. She did not know this septon, an earnest young man close to Edmure's age. He performed his office well enough, and his voice was rich and pleasant when he sang the praises to the Seven, but Catelyn found herself yearning for the thin quavering tones of Septon Osmynd, long dead. Osmynd would have listened patiently to the tale of what she had seen and felt in Renly's pavilion, and he might have known what it meant as well, and what she must do to lay to rest the shadows that stalked her dreams. Osmynd, my father, Uncle Brynden, old Maester Kym, they always seemed to know everything, but now there is only me, and it seems I know nothing, not even my duty. How can I do my duty if I do not know where it lies?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她祈祷之时，圣堂的修士带着香炉和水晶走进来，所以她多待了一会儿参加仪式。她不认得这位修士，他看上去非常虔诚，年纪和艾德慕相仿。他用浑圆愉悦的嗓音祝福七神，工作完成得恰如其分，但凯特琳发现自己在怀念奥密德修士细小颤抖的声调。老修士已过世多年，他若健在，定会耐心地听她倾诉在蓝礼营帐里发生的事，体会她的感受，他一定知道那里到底发生了什么，一定能教她如何摆脱纠缠的梦魇，赶走那不该有的阴影。奥密德，父亲，布林登叔叔，凯姆老师傅，他们总是无所不知，但如今只剩我一人，我却是什么都不懂。我甚至连自己责任所在都不清楚。如果连这都不知道，我该怎么来履行自己的责任呢？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="走到外面，一曲风格奇特的歌谣随风传来。“打油诗人”雷蒙德坐在酿酒房外，四周围了一圈听众。深沉的嗓音婉转嘹亮，他唱的是《德瑞蒙大人在嗜血牧原》：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Brienne paused to listen for a moment, broad shoulders hunched and thick arms crossed against her chest. A mob of ragged boys raced by, screeching and flailing at each other with sticks. Why do boys so love to play at war? Catelyn wondered if Rymund was the answer. The singer's voice swelled as he neared the end of his song.</div>

<div class="line_en">Later that day, Maester Vyman brought a letter. She saw him at once, hoping for some word from Robb, or from Ser Rodrik in Winterfell, but the message proved to be from one Lord Meadows, who named himself castellan of Storm's End. It was addressed to her father, her brother, her son, "or whoever now holds Riverrun." Ser Cortnay Penrose was dead, the man wrote, and Storm's End had opened its gate to Stannis Baratheon, the trueborn and rightful heir. The castle garrison had sworn their swords to his cause, one and all, and no man of them had suffered harm.</div>

<div class="line_en">Still, she was struck again by how strangely men behaved when it came to their bastards. Ned had always been fiercely protective of Jon, and Ser Cortnay Penrose had given up his life for this Edric Storm, yet… Roose Bolton's bastard had meant less to him than one of his dogs, to judge from the tone of the queer cold letter Edmure had gotten from him not three days past. He had crossed the Trident and was marching on Harrenhal as commanded, he wrote. "A strong castle, and well garrisoned, but His Grace shall have it, if I must kill every living soul within to make it so." He hoped His Grace would weigh that against the crimes of his bastard son, whom Ser Rodrik Cassel had put to death. "A fate he no doubt earned," Bolton had written. "Tainted blood is ever treacherous, and Ramsay's nature was sly, greedy, and cruel. I count myself well rid of him. The trueborn sons my young wife has promised me would never have been safe while he lived."</div>

<div class="line_en">Catelyn watched the riders spread out in a long line. Lord Jason's men waited to receive them behind rocks and grass and hillocks. A trumpet blast sent the horsemen forward at a ponderous walk, splashing down into the current. For a moment they made a brave show, all bright armor and streaming banners, the sun flashing off the points of their lances.</div>

A banner vanished suddenly as its bearer was swept under, and soon after the first dead man drifted past their walls, borne along by the current. By then the Lannisters had pulled back in confusion. She watched as they re-formed, conferred briefly, and galloped back the way they had come. The men on the walls shouted taunts after them, though they were already too far off to hear.</div>

<div class="line_en">Wrapped in a bedrobe, Catelyn climbed to the roof of the keep. From there she could see over the walls and the moonlit river to where the battle raged. The defenders had built watchfires along the bank, and perhaps the Lannisters thought to find them night-blind or unwary. If so, it was folly. Darkness was a chancy ally at best. As they waded in to breast their way across, men stepped in hidden pools and went down splashing, while others stumbled over stones or gashed their feet on the hidden caltrops. The Mallister bowmen sent a storm of fire arrows hissing across the river, strangely beautiful from afar. One man, pierced through a dozen times, his clothes afire, danced and whirled in the knee-deep water until at last he fell and was swept downstream. By the time his body came bobbing past Riverrun, the fires and his life had both been extinguished.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="披上睡袍，凯特琳急匆匆登上堡顶。从此，透过高高的城墙和月光照耀的河流，她看到两军交火的地方。防御者们在河堤上燃起警卫的篝火，兰尼斯特军大概认为能趁夜色不备或守军有所松懈，结果大错特错。黑暗是可疑的盟友。他们起初昂首挺胸，艰难跋涉，忽然便踩进暗坑被水冲走，或是绊住石头踏上蒺藜。梅利斯特的十字弓兵放出一阵阵火箭，飞矢在河流上空咝咝作响，远远观之有种别样的美。有个士兵身中十余弩箭，衣服着火，在齐膝深的水中跳来跳去，最终倒下，被水冲走。等他的尸体漂过奔流城，火焰和生命都已熄灭。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A small victory, Catelyn thought when the fighting had ended and the surviving foemen had melted back into the night, yet a victory nonetheless. As they descended the winding turret steps, Catelyn asked Brienne for her thoughts. "That was the brush of Lord Tywin's fingertip, my lady," the girl said. "He is probing, feeling for a weak point, an undefended crossing. If he does not find one, he will curl all his fingers into a fist and try and make one." Brienne hunched her shoulders. "That's what I'd do. Were I him." Her hand went to the hilt of her sword and gave it a little pat, as if to make certain it was still there.</div>

Ser Flement Brax had tried to force a crossing at a different ford six leagues to the south. This time the Lannisters shortened their lances and advanced across the river behind on foot, but the Mallister bowmen had rained high arcing shots down over their shields, while the scorpions Edmure had mounted on the riverbank sent heavy stones crashing through to break up the formation. "They left a dozen dead in the water, only two reaching the shallows, where we dealt with them briskly," the rider reported.

There's a song in this, by the gods, and one that even Edmure will want to hear. The mill that ground the Mountain down, I could almost make the words myself, had I the singer's gift."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="戴斯蒙·格瑞尔爵士兴高采烈。“噢，只可惜我没去，”她边读老骑士边感叹，“雷蒙德那傻瓜在哪里？该让他为这场战斗好好谱首曲子，诸神在上，我想这次连艾德慕也乐意倾听。《碾碎魔山的磨坊》，这名字怎么样？我真该自己来填词呢！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Lord Tywin had tried to force a crossing at a dozen different fords, her brother wrote, but every thrust had been thrown back. Lord Lefford had been drowned, the Crakehall knight called Strongboar taken captive, Ser Addam. Marbrand thrice forced to retreat… but the fiercest battle had been fought at Stone Mill, where Ser Gregor Clegane had led the assault. So many of his men had fallen that their dead horses threatened to dam the flow. In the end the Mountain and a handful of his best had gained the west bank, but Edmure had thrown his reserve at them, and they had shattered and reeled away bloody and beaten. Ser Gregor himself had lost his horse and staggered back across the Red Fork bleeding from a dozen wounds while a rain of arrows and stones fell all around him. "They shall not cross, Cat," Edmure scrawled, "Lord Tywin is marching to the southeast. A feint perhaps, or full retreat, it matters not. They shall not cross."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="泰温公爵在十几处渡口尝试强渡，弟弟写道，屡战屡败。莱佛德伯爵淹死，来自秧鸡厅克雷赫家外号“壮猪”的骑士被俘，亚当·马尔布兰爵士被打退三次…最激烈的战斗发生在石磨坊，此地由格雷果·克里冈爵士率队攻打。在冲锋中，他的人落马无数，以至于死马阻塞了河道。最后，魔山带一群精锐亲兵冲上西岸，但艾德慕调来后备部队加以反攻，敌军被彻底击溃，乱作一团，伤亡惨重。格雷果爵士失去了战马，身带十几处伤，狼狈地逃过红叉河，我军则用箭雨和飞石欢送。“他们过不了河，凯特，”艾德慕潦草地写道，“泰温公爵退往东南，大概想虚晃一枪后杀回来，又或是真的撤退。这都没关系，他们永远过不了河。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I'll hear no songs until the fighting's done," Catelyn said, perhaps too sharply. Yet she allowed Ser Desmond to spread the word, and agreed when he suggested breaking open some casks in honor of Stone Mill. The mood within Riverrun had been strained and somber; they would all be better for a little drink and hope.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“战斗结束前，我不想听任何歌曲，”凯特琳尖刻地说，但她允许戴斯蒙爵士将胜利的消息传出去，并同意他的提议——大开酒桶为石磨坊的荣耀干杯。这段时间，奔流城的气氛一直紧张压抑，给人们一点希望和饮料是再好不过的事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That night the castle rang to the sounds of celebration. "Riverrun!" the smallfolk shouted, and "Tully! Tully!" They'd come frightened and helpless, and her brother had taken them in when most lords would have closed their gates. Their voices floated in through the high windows, and seeped under the heavy redwood doors. Rymund played his harp, accompanied by a pair of drummers and a youth with a set of reed pipes. Catelyn listened to girlish laughter, and the excited chatter of the green boys her brother had left her for a garrison. Good sounds… and yet they did not touch her. She could not share their happiness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当晚，城堡洋溢着欢庆的笑语。“奔流城万岁！”平民们高呼，“徒利万岁！万岁！”他们来时既恐惧又无助，是弟弟收容了他们——虽然世上绝大多数领主都会将他们拒之门外。他们为他齐声欢呼，声音流过高耸的大窗户，渗出厚重的红木门。雷蒙德弹奏竖琴，身边伴着两位鼓手和一个吹簧管的小伙子。凯特琳听着弟弟留给她作守备队的这些青涩少年羞赧地笑语，兴奋地叽叽喳喳。这些声音很可爱…却不能触及她的心房。她无法分享他们的快乐。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She closed the book even more uneasy than before. The gods had granted them victory after victory. At Stone Mill, at Oxcross, in the Battle of the Camps, at the Whispering Wood…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="合上书本时，她只觉更加不安。诸神把一场又一场的胜利赐给我们：在石磨坊，在牛津，在奔流城外，在呓语森林…">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In her father's solar she found a heavy leatherbound book of maps and opened it to the riverlands. Her eyes found the path of the Red Fork and traced it by flickering candlelight. Marching to the southeast, she thought. By now they had likely reached the headwaters of the Blackwater Rush, she decided.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在父亲的书房，她找出一本厚重的、皮面精装的地图册，翻到河间地的部分。在摇曳的烛光下，她的眼睛顺着红叉河道来回巡视。他退往东南，她想。现在大概到了黑水河源头附近，她估计。">查看中文翻译</div>
