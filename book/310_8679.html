<div class="line_en">In the summer recess between freshman and sophomore years in college, I was invited to be an instructor at a high school leadership camp hosted by a college in Michigan. I was already highly involved in most campus activities, and I jumped at the opportunity.</div>

<div class="line_en">About an hour into the first day of camp, amid the frenzy of icebreakers and forced interactions, I first noticed the boy under the tree. He was small and skinny, and his obvious discomfort and shyness made him appear frail and fragile. Only fifty feet away, two hundred eager campers were bumping bodies, playing, joking and meeting each other, but the boy under the tree seemed to want to be anywhere other than where he was. The desperate loneliness he radiated almost stopped me from approaching him, but I remembered the instructions from the senior staff to stay alert for campers who might feel left out.</div>

<div class="line_en">As I walked toward him, I said, "I, my name is Kevin, and I'm one of the counselors. It's nice to meet you. How are you?" In a shaky, sheepish voice he reluctantly answered, "Okay, I guess." I calmly asked him if he wanted to join the activities and meet some new people. He quietly replied, "No, this is not really my thing."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我朝他走去，说道：“你好，我叫凯文，我是夏令营的辅导员。很高兴见到你。你好吗？”他用颤抖羞怯的声音不情愿地回答道，“还好吧。”我冷静地问他是否愿意参加一些活动，结交一些新朋友。他静静地答道：“不，这真的不是我想做的事情。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I could sense that he was in a new world, that this whole experience was foreign to him. But I somehow knew it wouldn't be right to push him, either. He didn't need a pep talk; he needed a friend. After several silent moments, my first interaction with the boy under the tree was over.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我能感觉到，他处在一个崭新的世界里，这里的一切对他来说都是陌生的。可是，我有时觉得强迫他也不是什么好办法。他需要的不是鼓励的话语，而是一位朋友。一段沉默过后，我和树下男孩的第一次互动也宣告结束了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At lunch the next day, I found myself leading camp songs at the top of my lungs for two hundred of my new friends. The campers eagerly participated. My gaze wandered over the mass of noise and movement and was caught by the image of the boy from under the tree, sitting alone, staring out the window. I nearly forgot the words to the song I was supposed to be leading. At my first opportunity, I tried again, with the same questions as before, "How are you doing? Are you okay?" To which he again replied, "Yeah, I'm all right. I just don't really get into this stuff." As I left the cafeteria, I realized this was going to take more time and effort than I had thought -- if it was even possible to get through to him at all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天午餐的时候，我为两百位新朋友高声唱起了夏令营之歌。队员们兴高采烈地跟着我一起唱。我的目光穿过嘈杂流动的人群，停在了那个单独坐在树下凝望着窗外的男孩身上。我差点忘了正在领唱的歌词。我又抓住机会试着再一次接近他，我像上一次那样问道：“你感觉怎么样？你还好吗？”他还是那样回答我：“是的，我还好。我只是不太想做这些事情。”从餐厅走出来的时候，我明白了，要想打开他的心扉，需要的时间和精力比我之前预计的还要多。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The days I spend at camp each year fly by faster than any others I have known. Thus, before I knew it, mid-week had dissolved into the final night of camp, and I was chaperoning the "last dance". The students were doing all they could to savor every last moment with their new "best friends"-- friends they would probably never see again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="每一年我在夏令营的日子，比我所知道的其他任何时候都要过得快。于是不知不觉，周三成为了此次夏令营的最后一夜，我陪伴着他们跳最后一支舞。学生们和新交的“挚友”——或许今后再也无法相见的朋友——尽情享受这最后时刻。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As I watched the campers share their parting moments, I suddenly saw what would be one of the most vivid memories of my life. The boy from under the tree, who had stared blankly out the kitchen window, was now a shirtless dancing wonder. He owned the dance floor as he and two girls proceeded to cut a rug. I watched as he shared meaningful, intimate time with people at whom he couldn't even look just days earlier. I couldn't believe it was the same person.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="正当我看着队员们共享临别时刻时，我突然看见了生命中最动人的一幕：那个曾经茫然凝望着厨窗外的树下男孩，此时早已脱去外上衣，正在热情地舞蹈着。当他和两个女孩一起热舞时，他吸引了全场的目光。我看着他与人分享着意义深长又亲密无间的时光。可就在几天前，他甚至都不愿意看这些人一眼，我简直不敢相信这是同一个人。">查看中文翻译</div>

The last few months were the best few months of his life."</div>
