<div class="line_en">Recently she had made another entry into his mind. Returning home with the milk one morning as usual, she stood in the doorway with a crow wrapped in her red scarf and pressed against her breast. It was the way gypsies held their babies.</div>

<div class="line_en">She had found it half-buried, the way Cossacks used to dig their prisoners into the ground. It was children, she said, and her words did more than state a fact; they revealed an unexpected repugnance for people in general. It reminded him of something she had said to him not long before: I'm beginning to be grateful to you for not wanting to have children.</div>

<div class="line_en">And then she had complained to him about a man who had been bothering her at work. He had grabbed at a cheap necklace of hers and suggested that the only way she could have afforded it was by doing some prostitution on the side. She was very upset about it. More than necessary, thought Tomas. He suddenly felt dismayed at how little he had seen of her the last two years; he had so few opportunities to press her hands in his to stop them from trembling.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在前一天，她还向他抱怨，有个家伙在她工作的酒吧侮辱她。他扯着她廉价的项链，一口咬定那是她卖淫赚来的。她像变了个人似的，托马斯思忖着，比事情本身要严重得多。想到两年来见她的时候如此少，他甚至不再有机会紧握她的双手让它们停止颤抖，他突然难受起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

The woman who gave the window washers their assignments told him that a private customer had insisted on him personally. Tomas was not looking forward to it; he was afraid it was still another woman. Fully occupied with Tereza, he was in no mood for adventure.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="早上，他满脑子里都是那些念头，来到公司办公室，一个职员在那儿给清洗工安排一天的活儿，一个私人主顾特别要求他们派托马斯去洗窗户。他心境恶劣，前往指定的地点，害怕叫他的又是个女人。他只想着特蕾莎，艳遇对他已经没有诱惑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“请进，大夫。”他微笑着说，并领他进了客厅。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Clearly windows had nothing to do with the case. He had not been called in to do the windows; he had been lured into a trap. He had never before talked to his son.

As far as he was concerned, the less he knew about his son the better, and he hoped the feeling was mutual.</div>

<div class="line_en">Tomas now glanced around the room. The walls were hung with interesting pictures, mostly photographs and posters. The drawing the editor had singled out came from one of the last issues of his paper before the Russians closed it down in 1969. It was an imitation of a famous recruitment poster from the Russian Civil War of 1918 showing a soldier, red star on his cap and extraordinarily stern look in his eyes, staring straight at you and aiming his index finger at you. The original Russian caption read: Citizen, have you joined the Red Army? It was replaced by a Czech text that read: Citizen, have you signed the Two Thousand Words?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="进门后，托马斯第一次抬起头。墙上挂满了有趣的画，有不少照片和招贴画。记者指的那张刊登在周刊一九六九年年末的某期上，那时杂志还没被俄国人查禁。它模仿一九一八年俄国内战时号召群众加入红军的一张著名宣传画：一个头戴红五星军帽、目光极其严峻的战士直逼着你的眼睛，一手的食指指着你。俄文原文写着：“公民，你还没有参加红军？”这话被替换成下面的捷克文字：“公民，你在《两千字书》上签名了吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Nice poster, isn't it? said the editor, pointing at a large framed drawing on the wall opposite Tomas.</div>

<div class="line_en">That was an excellent joke! The Two Thousand Words was the first glorious manifesto of the 1968 Prague Spring. It called for the radical democratization of the Communist regime. First it was signed by a number of intellectuals, and then other people came forward and asked to sign, and finally there were so many signatures that no one could quite count them up. When the Red Army invaded their country and launched a series of political purges, one of the questions asked of each citizen was Have you signed the Two Thousand Words? Anyone who admitted to having done so was summarily dismissed from his job.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是个绝妙的玩笑！《两千字书》是布拉格之春的第一个重大宣言，要求共产党制度彻底民主化。一批知识分子在上面签了名，接着是普通民众，签名如此之多，数都数不清。当红军入侵波希米亚，政治清洗开始时，摆在公民面前的一个问题便是：“你呢，你在《两千字书》上签名了吗？”凡承认签过名的，当场被解雇。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Let's hope the Red Army man isn't listening in on us, said the editor with a smile.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="记者微微一笑：“希望红军战士没在听我们说话。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then he switched back to a playful tone. But the way I' look at it, we've got nothing to hide. And think of what a boon it will be to Czech historians of the future. The complete recorded lives of the Czech intelligentsia on file in the police archives! Do you know what effort literary historians have put into reconstructing in detail the sex lives of, say, Voltaire or Balzac or Tolstoy?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着，他的口气又轻松下来：“可我认为我们也没什么要藏着掖着的。此外，想想吧，未来的捷克历史学家从中还可以得到好处！他们能在警察的档案里找到所有知识分子的生平，那全都被录在磁带上了！您知道，一个文学史家为重构伏尔泰、巴尔扎克或托尔斯泰的性生活要费多大的力气？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then he went on, without the smile: Seriously though, this isn't my flat. It belongs to a friend. We can't be absolutely certain the police can hear us; it's only a possibility. If I'd invited you to my place, it would have been a certainty.</div>

<div class="line_en">After the three of them had had a good laugh, the editor told the story of how his paper had been banned, what the artist who designed the poster was doing, and what had become of other Czech painters, philosophers, and writers. After the Russian invasion they had been relieved of their positions and become window washers, parking attendants, night watchmen, boilermen in public buildings, or at best -- and usually with pull -- taxi drivers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="三个人都笑了，接着，记者开始长时间地谈论他的周刊被禁的始末，谈起当初构思这幅漫画的画家如今在干什么，谈起捷克其他画家、哲学家、作家如今在干什么。俄国入侵之后，他们无一例外地被剥夺了工作，成了擦洗玻璃的、看停车场的、门房守夜的、给公共建筑烧锅炉的，最好的是开出租车的，因为这还需要门路。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And turning to the imaginary microphones in the wall, he said in a stentorian voice, Gentlemen, as always in such circumstances, I wish to take this opportunity to encourage you in your work and to thank you on my behalf and on behalf of all future historians.</div>

<div class="line_en">Although what the editor said was interesting enough, Tomas was unable to concentrate on it. He was thinking about his son. He remembered passing him in the street during the past two months. Apparently these encounters had not been fortuitous. He had certainly never expected to find him in the company of a persecuted editor. Tomas's first wife was an orthodox Communist, and Tomas automatically assumed that his son was under her influence. He knew nothing about him. Of course he could have come out and asked him what kind of relationship he had with his mother, but he felt that it would have been tactless in the presence of a third party.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="记者说的一切并非没有意思。然而托马斯的注意力怎么也集中不到他的话上。他在想他的儿子。他想起近几个月来，他常在路上遇到他。显然，那不是偶然的。让他吃惊的是，儿子愿跟受迫害的记者在一起。托马斯的前妻是个坚定的共产党员，他自然而然地推断儿子一定是受了她的影响。他对他一无所知。当然，他可以问问他跟母亲的关系怎么样，但当着陌生人的面提这个问题似乎不合时宜。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">According to our sources, he said, political prisoners are being subjected to very rough treatment. Several are in a bad way. And so we've decided to draft a petition and have it signed by the most important Czech intellectuals, the ones who still mean something.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“根据我们的了解，”他说，“政治犯受尽了折磨。有几个人的情况极其危急。于是，我们想起草一份请愿书，由捷克最知名的、目前说话还有一定分量的知识分子签名，这或许是件好事情。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">No, it wasn't actually a stutter; it was more of a stammer, slowing down the flow of speech, stressing or highlighting every word he uttered whether he wanted to or not.

<div class="line_en">And suddenly Tomas recalled the portly policeman handing him the denunciation of none other than this tall editor with the big chin. Everyone was trying to make him sign statements he had not written himself.</div>

<div class="line_en">There's nothing to think over anyway, said his son.</div>

<div class="line_en">Although his words were aggressive, his intonation bordered on the supplicatory. Now that they were looking each other in the eye, Tomas noticed that when concentrating the boy slightly raised the left side of his upper lip. It was an expression he saw on his own face whenever he peered into the mirror to determine whether it was clean-shaven. Discovering it on the face of another made him uneasy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="言词逼人，语调却近乎恳求。这一次，他们相互对视，托马斯注意到，当儿子专注地看东西时，上唇左角会微微翘起。这一翘，他很熟悉，当他对着镜子，仔细检查胡子有没有刮干净时，在自己的脸上常见这种表情。看到它出现在别人的脸上，一种不快的感觉油然而生，他难以抑止。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When parents live with their children through childhood, they grow accustomed to that kind of similarity; it seems trivial to them or, if they stop and think about it, amusing. But Tomas was talking to his son for the first time in his life! He was not used to sitting face to face with his own asymmetrical mouth!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一个人要是一直和孩子在一起生活，彼此的相似之处，早已习以为常，有时注意到了，也会觉得很正常甚至会觉得有趣。但，这是托马斯生平第一次和儿子说话！在坐在对面的人嘴上见到这一翘，他还真的不习惯！">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Imagine having an arm amputated and implanted on someone else. Imagine that person sitting opposite you and gesticulating with it in your face. You would stare at that arm as at a ghost. Even though it was your own personal, beloved arm, you would be horrified at the possibility of its touching you!</div>

<div class="line_en">And Tomas suddenly saw that what was really at stake in this scene they were playing was not the amnesty of political prisoners; it was his relationship with his son. If he signed, their fates would be united and Tomas would be more or less obliged to befriend him; if he failed to sign, their relations would remain null as before, though now not so much by his own will as by the will of his son, who would renounce his father for his cowardice</div>

<div class="line_en">He was in the situation of a chess player who cannot avoid checkmate and is forced to resign. Whether he signed the petition or not made not the slightest difference. It would alter nothing in his own life or in the lives of the political prisoners.</div>
