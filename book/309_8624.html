<div class="line_en">In the summer of 1942, the town of Molching was preparing for the inevitable. There were still people who refused to believe that this small town on Munich's outskirts could be a target, but the majority of the population was well aware that it was not a question of if, but when. Shelters were more clearly marked, windows were in the process of being blackened for the nights, and everyone knew where the closest basement or cellar was.</div>

<div class="line_en">For Hans Hubermann, this uneasy development was actually a slight reprieve. At an unfortunate time, good luck had somehow found its way into his painting business. People with blinds were desperate enough to enlist his services to paint them. His problem was that black paint was normally used more as a mixer, to darken other colors, and it was soon depleted and hard to find. What he did have was the knack of being a good tradesman, and a good tradesman has many tricks. He took coal dust and stirred it through, and he worked cheap. There were many houses in all parts of Molching in which he confiscated the window light from enemy eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对汉斯·胡伯曼来说，战事的恶化反倒拉了他一把。尽管时势艰难，粉刷生意却出其不意地开始好转。家里有百叶窗的人都拼命地找上门来，求他上门施工。不过他也遇到了一个问题，黑油漆通常只用于调色，用来加深其他颜色，所以很快就用光了，买也买不到。不过他有着商人的头脑，总能想出许多点子来。他找来煤灰拌进油漆里，以低廉的价格出售。在莫尔辛，他为许多房屋遮蔽从窗户透出的光线，以躲避敌人的视线。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Frau Hallah, I'm sorry, I have no black paint left," he would say, but a little farther down the road, he would always break. There was tall man and long street. "Tomorrow," he'd promise, "first thing," and when the next morning dawned, there he was, painting those blinds for nothing, or for a cookie or a warm cup of tea. The previous evening, he'd have found another way to turn blue or green or beige to black. Never did he tell them to cover their windows with spare blankets, for he knew they'd need them when winter came. He was even known to paint people's blinds for half a cigarette, sitting on the front step of a house, sharing a smoke with the occupant. Laughter and smoke rose out of the conversation before they moved on to the next job.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽然他会说，“哈拉太太，真对不起，我的黑漆全用光了”，可没走出多远，他就会心软。长街尽头，这个高大的男人承诺道：“明天，我先给你家刷。”于是第二天清晨，他就来帮她们刷窗户，却分文不取，最多只拿一片饼干或喝一杯热茶。前一晚，他又想出了新办法，用蓝色、绿色或褐色的油漆调成黑色。他从来不会建议大家用毛毯遮盖窗户，因为这些东西到了冬天就要派上用场。人们甚至听说，他会为了半支香烟帮人刷窗户，完工后和主人坐在大门前的台阶上分享一根烟。烟雾和笑声伴随着交谈升腾而起，抽完后，他和莉泽尔便要赶往下一个工作地点。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They carted his paint through town, smelling the hunger on some of the streets and shaking their heads at the wealth on others. Many times, on the way home, women with nothing but kids and poverty would come running out and plead with him to paint their blinds.</div>

<div class="line_en">On other occasions, when she was daydreaming, Papa would dab her lightly with his brush, right between the eyes. If he misjudged and there was too much on it, a small path of paint would dribble down the side of her nose. She would laugh and try to return the favor, but Hans Hubermann was a hard man to catch out at work. It was there that he was most alive.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有时候，当莉泽尔听得出了神，爸爸会用刷子轻轻点在她的眉心。要是他判断失误，刷子上蘸了太多油漆，便有一道油漆顺着她的鼻子淌下来。她会开怀大笑，试图报仇，可是汉斯·胡伯曼身手敏捷，很难逮到。这种时候，他分外有活力。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Whenever they had a break, to eat or drink, he would play the accordion, and it was this that Liesel remembered best. Each morning, while Papa pushed or dragged the paint cart, Liesel carried the instrument. "Better that we leave the paint behind," Hans told her, "than ever forget the music." When they paused to eat, he would cut up the bread, smearing it with what little jam remained from the last ration card. Or he'd lay a small slice of meat on top of it. They would eat together, sitting on their cans of paint, and with the last mouthfuls still in the chewing stages, Papa would be wiping his fingers, unbuckling the accordion case.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="每到休息时间，不管是吃饭还是喝水的时候，他都会拉起手风琴，这是莉泽尔记忆里最为鲜活的时刻。每天清晨，爸爸拖着或推着装油漆的小车出门，莉泽尔便抱着这台乐器。“就算忘了带油漆，”汉斯告诉她，“也不能忘了音乐。”停工吃饭时，他切开面包，抹上最后一点限量供应的果酱，或者放上一小片肉，分给莉泽尔。他们一同坐在油漆罐上吃饭，爸爸嘴里还有最后一口没有嚼完，便抹干净手，打开手风琴盒子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The science of Papa's trade brought him an even greater level of respect. It was well and good to share bread and music, but it was nice for Liesel to know that he was also more than capable in his occupation. Competence was attractive.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="原来这个行当还有那么多学问，莉泽尔对爸爸的景仰之情也随之水涨船高。爸爸愿意同她分享面包和音乐，这已经很棒了，但是让莉泽尔明白他能胜任自己的工作有别样的意义，因为有能力的人更有魅力。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As far as the painting itself was concerned, probably the most interesting aspect for Liesel was the mixing. Like most people, she assumed her papa simply took his cart to the paint shop or hardware store and asked for the right color and away he went. She didn't realize that most of the paint was in lumps, in the shape of a brick. It was then rolled out with an empty champagne bottle. (Champagne bottles, Hans explained, were ideal for the job, as their glass was slightly thicker than that of an ordinary bottle of wine.) Once that was completed, there was the addition of water, whiting, and glue, not to mention the complexities of matching the right color.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="至于粉刷工作，莉泽尔觉得调油漆是最有趣的工序。她跟很多人一样，以为爸爸想要什么颜色的油漆，就推着车直接去油漆店或五金店买。她从来没想过油漆竟然是块状的，跟砖头差不多，还得先用香槟酒瓶把油漆碾碎。（汉斯给她解释过，香槟酒瓶是最理想的工具，因为它们的瓶身比普通酒瓶的厚实。）完成这一步后，才能往里面加水、胶粉和白垩粉，这还不算完，调色也是极其复杂的步骤。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Liesel would sit each day with her hands between her knees, in the long legs of daylight. She wanted none of those days to end, and it was always with disappointment that she watched the darkness stride forward.</div>

<div class="line_en">One afternoon, a few days after Papa's explanation of the mixing, they were working at one of the wealthier houses just east of Munich Street. Papa called Liesel inside in the early afternoon. They were just about to move on to another job when she heard the unusual volume in his voice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爸爸跟她解释过油漆的调配工序之后，又过了几天，一个下午，他们正在慕尼黑大街东部的一户有钱人家里施工。天色还早，接下来他们还要去下一个工作地点。莉泽尔突然听到爸爸在大声喊她，声音大得有点不寻常。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他举起高脚杯，示意其他人一起举杯。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The afternoon had been warm. Liesel was slightly put off by the coolness of her glass. She looked at Papa for approval. He grinned and said, "Prost, Madel -- cheers, girl." Their glasses chimed together and the moment Liesel raised it to her mouth, she was bitten by the fizzy, sickly sweet taste of champagne. Her reflexes forced her to spit straight onto her papa's overalls, watching it foam and dribble. A shot of laughter followed from all of them, and Hans encouraged her to give it another try. On the second attempt she was able to swallow it, and enjoy the taste of a glorious broken rule. It felt great. The bubbles ate her tongue. They prickled her stomach. Even as they walked to the next job, she could feel the warmth of pins and needles inside her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那是一个温暖的午后。高脚杯的凉意令莉泽尔有些迟疑。她向爸爸望去，征求他的同意。他咧开嘴笑了，说道：“干杯吧，孩子。”大家碰杯时，杯子发出清脆的响声。莉泽尔刚把杯子举到嘴边，香槟那带着泡沫的甜腻味道就让她打了个激灵。她条件反射般地把酒吐在了爸爸的工装裤上，看着它冒着泡往下流。大家哈哈大笑，汉斯则鼓励她再喝一口。这一次，她终于把酒喝了下去，享受着破戒的美妙滋味。这味道棒极了。泡沫蜇着她的舌头，刺激着她的胃。甚至当他们赶往下一个工作地点时，她依旧能感受到体内犹如针刺般的暖意。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Once inside, she was taken to the kitchen, where two older women and a man sat on delicate, highly civilized chairs. The women were well dressed. The man had white hair and sideburns like hedges. Tall glasses stood on the table. They were filled with crackling liquid.</div>

They could never be equal to the casual concentration on Papa's face. Or there wouldn't be a paintwork-traded cigarette slouched on the player's lips. And they could never make a small mistake with a three-note laugh of hindsight. Not the way he could.</div>
