<div class="line_en">"Mrs Simpson knew a lot about life," Edward once said. "She loved books, food, people, and travel. She was very beautiful and her eyes were full of fire. She was friendly and easy to talk to and, after a while, I opened up my heart. We had no secrets. I told her everything. And that's how it all began."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“辛普森夫人生活阅历丰富，”爱德华有一次说，“她爱看书，喜欢食物，关爱他人，也喜欢旅行。她非常漂亮，眼里总是充满热情。她待人友善，同她谈话很轻松，没多久我就敞开了心扉。我们之间没有秘密。我对她无所不谈。一切就是这样开始的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"His eyes were always sad," Wallis said about Edward. "And sometimes he looked like a child -- so young, so quiet, so weak. He had no real friends. Perhaps people were a little afraid of him. But he was a warm and kind man. When he talked to me, I felt my heart jump. I wanted to be alone with him, but I knew that wasn't possible. Did the Prince love me in those early days? No, I don't think so. But each time we met, we just felt closer and closer."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他的眼神总是那么忧伤，”沃利斯这样描述爱德华，“有时他看起来像个孩子——那么年轻，那么温文尔雅，那么脆弱。他没有真正的朋友。也许人们有点儿怕他。但他是一个热心而善良的人。当他对我说话时，我能感觉到自己的心在跳。我想和他单独在一起，但我知道那是不可能的。王子在与我初识的那些日子里爱我吗？不，我想他不爱。但每次我们相见，都感到彼此更接近了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
