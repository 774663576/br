<div class="line_en">A Dowayo Village at the end of the dry season is characterized by feverish creative endeavour. Dowayos live in a world of very firm lines. In the wet season, once the rain-chief has applied the remedies to the rain-pots and made the storm clouds gather, one set of activities is permitted. In the dry season, when the rain-pots have been wiped dry or purged with fire, another range of human skills is allowed to be employed. To perform dry-season tasks in the wet season or vice versa is to disturb the cosmic order and could have devastating results for all. The hands that performed such acts would erupt in boils, women would miscarry, pots would explode. Likewise a firm line marks off male from female activities. A man must never draw water. This is women's work. A woman must not weave cloth. That is a man's task. Dowayos live quite happily within the network of such prohibitions. There is a comforting sense of place and appropriate time. The ethnographer comes to know and dread the reply, 'It is not the right time to talk of this. It is not the moment.' No amount of cajolery, no pantomime of disappointment, will melt a Dowayo's heart once it has been deemed the wrong time for certain things.</div>

<div class="line_en">Dowayo restrictions on labour do not, however, end here. Within the apparent uniformity of life with the cattle and the fields lies a system of demarcations that would inspire envy in a shipyard worker. Only blacksmiths may forge. Only their women may make pots. Hunters may not keep cattle. Rain-makers and smiths must not meet. Each activity has its responsibilities and potential dangers. Precautions not taken, prohibitions ignored, all have their effects on the community.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="多瓦悠人对工作的限制不仅于此。表面上看来，他们全过着牧牛、耕田的一致生活，其实隐含令船坞工人艳羡不已的分工系统。譬如只有铁匠才能炼铁，也只有他们的老婆才能制陶。猎人不能养牛。祈雨酋长与铁匠永远不能见面。每项活动都有它的责任与潜在危险。忽略采取预防措施、漠视禁忌，都将给社群带来恶果。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At the end of the dry season there is always a backlog of things not done or not completed. Grass must be cut for running repairs to the roof. The potter must fire all those pots hanging around the compound. The hunter must hang up his bow on the shrine to wild animals and make offerings of eggs. All this before the rain-chief declares the rainy season and such activities become forbidden. At such moments, the normal languid pace of Dowayo life is transformed. A passing visitor would carry away tales of the frenzied industry and Protestant ethic of this little mountain tribe that would puzzle those that know Dowayos better.</div>

<div class="line_en">It is a clear mark of the anomalous position of an outside fieldworker that he can happily ignore almost all the prohibitions that Dowayos must obey. If he does women's work it is a mere joke, a story to be rehearsed with sniggers around the camp-fire. He will inevitably show himself to be vastly inept at any attempt actually to make something with his hands. When potting he will burn himself. Carried away in the process of weaving, he is sure to trip over the threads, pulling the loom to the ground and ruining the handkerchief-sized piece of cloth it took him hours to produce. All this is part of the anthropologist's contribution to the people who put up with him. He provides light relief, a jester in shorts. A particular favourite of the Dowayos was the basket I wove under the eagle eye of the old woman across the compound. Happening upon her one day as she sat under the shady awning deftly manipulating tree-bark and reeds, I was entranced by this image of rural domesticity. There was something deeply therapeutic and calming in the elegant economy of her gestures. I would have to have a go.</div>

<div class="line_en">The mere sight of a man making baskets is enough to reduce a whole village to hysterical laughter. My instructress wept with mirth. Zuuldibo, coming to see what all the noise was about, guffawed heartily and mimicked the expression of outraged concentration on my face. I could see he would use that later when he came to repeat the story to the men. Children gazed at me with intense wonder. There was something here that defied explanation. The form of the basket was a deep joy to them as it evolved in my stumbling fingers. Dowayo baskets are traditionally round and shallow. My own had no form for which geometry can supply a name. It was elliptical, slightly square on one side, firmly round on the other. It had a sort of lump halfway down that no amount of tugging and pulling could disperse. It had enigmatic loose ends that threatened to unravel. 'Where does this bit go?' I asked. Screams of laughter. Zuuldibo smashed his fist against his thigh and clutched his stomach. He repeated the phrase. That, too, would go into his tale. My assistant looked pained and crept away. Once more. I was letting him down.</div>

<div class="line_en">The only sour note was from my neighbour, Alice. Alice was a shrew. The Dowayos do not have such a term. They regarded her more directly as 'a bitter vagina'. It was never revealed what had soured her life, what betrayal or disappointment had led to such an unpleasant character. Whatever it was‚ she displayed such a readiness to be disagreeable on all occasions that I could not understand how she had avoided allegations of witchcraft -- the normal fate of tiresome or intimidating women in Africa. Her sons lived in fear of her tongue and had seized the opportunity provided by an indecently early marriage even by Dowayo standards to move in with their wives' kin -- explaining that they were too young to have paid full bride-price and must therefore work for their brides' fathers. She had long since nagged to death the last in a series of ever more timorous husbands and had been swiftly ejected from his village. In her old age, she had returned to plague Zuuldibo, a nephew. Although her limbs had atrophied and she demanded considerable help in the fields, her tongue was still robust and active.</div>

<div class="line_en">I had many reasons to be grateful to Alice. I discovered after installing myself in the village, that the chief had only allowed a stranger to live in his own compound so that I would serve as a buffer between Alice and himself. She was conveniently able to lean over the low wall that separated us at all hours of the day and talk, talk, talk. Ín the course of a morning, I must have received more exposure to language than one could normally hope for in a week. This was good for me, Zuuldibo sniggered, and remarked that my use of the negative would benefit most. In her many and elaborate pronouncements, she never said anything nice about anyone.</div>

<div class="line_en">Her comments on my basket-making were not kind or even intended to be helpful. Laughter evaporated around her like dew in the sun. When favouring me with her views on anything -- and Alice had very strong and well-rounded views on most things -- she constantly returned to the evils of celibacy as opposed to the blessings of marriage. She constituted a powerful argument against her own case. The present occasion was too much for her. That a man should actually make a basket! Beneath her withering tongue, I sloped away and hid the product of my incipient craft. Throughout my stay, Dowayos would ask to see it and collapse in helpless laughter in the face of it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱丽丝对我织篮技术的评语既不客气，也不具任何建设性意图。她一现身，笑声便似太阳下的晨露消失无踪。每当她惠赐我有关事物的见解——她对任何事都有强烈且多彩的批评——结论总是万流归宗至独身的坏处与婚姻的好处，论点与她的处境恰成反比。眼前的状况真是是可忍孰不可忍，一个大男人居然编篮子！在她令人气馁的毒舌攻击下，我偷偷溜走，藏起我生疏的手工艺品。在我停留多瓦悠兰期间，人们常来求借篮子一观，一看到它的模样，便止不住大笑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In anthropology, enjoyment is often used as an approximate yardstick of understanding. The idea is that if an anthropologist does not like anything he encounters among an alien people, this is ethnocentrism. If he disapproves of anything, this is the result of bringing to bear the wrong standards. It is often ignored that very often the culture that the ethnographer enjoys least is his own, the one that he should know best. No such strictures are brought to bear upon pleasure. An ethnographer who likes some facet of the culture he is studying is never accused of ethnocentrism or wrong standards. This curious fact has led to a bizarre slanting of ethnographic monographs, wherein the fieldworker is depicted as wallowing in unmitigated delight in the things he experiences. Possibly this is why the actual experience of fieldwork comes as such a shock to the beginner and seems to call into question his commitment to the subject.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="人类学里，“喜欢与否”常是用来评估你是否了解一个民族的标杆。背后的逻辑是这样的：如果一个人类学家不喜欢某个异民族的某些事情，这是民族中心主义。如果他对这个异民族的某些行为不表赞同，那是他受到错误标准的影响。人们经常忽略人类学家最不喜欢的文化往往就是他自己的文化（也就是他最了解的那个文化）。至于人类学家的“喜欢”，则不受非难苛评。他如果喜欢研究对象的某些文化面向，绝不会有人批评他民族中心主义或错用标准。这个奇怪事实让民族学论文产生诡异的偏倾，在其中，田野工作者被勾勒成满心欢喜沉浸于田野经验带来的无上乐趣。或许因为如此，真正的田野经验会让菜鸟大为震惊，进而质疑自己对此项学问的投入。">查看中文翻译</div>

Fortunately, they did. When Alice was in full spate, railing against someone or something unfortunate enough to attract her attention, Zuuldibo could often be heard giving an ironic sotto voce commentary from behind the other wall of the compound. Matthieu became especially good at mimicking Alice's voice and the impersonation of her became something of a party trick with him.</div>

<div class="line_en">Technical processes do not just produce objects, they offer us models for thinking about other things -- principally ourselves. The invention of the pump gave us new ways of thinking about the human heart. The invention of the computer has recently given us completely new ways of thinking about the brain, displacing models based upon telephone systems. For Dowayos, the process of potting provides a model for thinking about the maturation of the human being through time and the seasons of the year. The actual ritual system is quite complex but its outlines can be quite easily grasped. Humans are born with soft heads. Hot objects and animals are dangerous to them and can cause fevers. At circumcision, a boy is at his wettest as he kneels in the stream bleeding into the water. Thereafter, he is dried by the application of fire as the weather too dries up. The various processes culminate in the baking of the heads of the boys by piling them up and firing branches over their heads. Hereafter, the boys are held to have hardened heads and the heads (glans) of their penes are also held to be dry and properly male. The various changes that occur after death are similarly held to dry the head until it becomes a skull purged of flesh. The use of the potting model is quite clear in the ritual system but never put into words. It was therefore important confirmatory evidence for me that the smiths and potters, in their technical vocabulary, tie the two processes of human maturation and potting together.</div>

In the present case, no one was too anxious to look further into the matter. A sort of collective sigh of relief went up. It was quite the jolliest funeral I have ever been to. Particular care was taken with the more formal parts of the ritual. Spirits of the dead are enough of a nuisance as it is. No one wanted Alice coming back. And so matters rested for some time.</div>

<div class="line_en">A number of strange people appeared in rapid succession. First, there was a grizzled and bearded Spaniard who was driving from Spain to the Cape. Knowing little of the terrain through which he was to pass, except that the Sahara was full of sand and the rest full of mud with few roads, he had prepared himself against disaster by the simple expedient of coming by tractor. At a magnificent fifteen miles an hour, he had chugged manfully across the Sahara and down as far as Cameroon. As protection against the assaults of heat, wind, sand and now rain, he had rigged up an aluminium awning. Necessary supplies and equipment were packed in a trailer that he had dragged without problems for thousands of miles. Astonishingly, the whole idea had worked perfectly. He found that the tractor was the ideal vehicle for the bush. His major problem had been in crossing borders where he fell into the awkward and potentially disastrous category of one importing agricultural equipment. He was having a marvellous time and clearly regarded me as a typical English eccentric, after the fashion of all English eccentrics, in that I dwelt in the bush. In support of his allegations against the race, he told the tale of an Englishman, long resident in Barcelona, who rode a cow instead of a horse. He slowly disappeared and I never saw him again.</div>

She‚ too, it appeared, was set on crossing Africa to revisit the scene of her birth, somewhere in the east. Most notable, was her cycling dress, with all parts of the body covered against the sun. She confirmed that she was an albino and therefore suffered terribly from sunburn. This made it impossible for her to wear the normal shorts and vest and she had a somewhat demure Edwardian air through the sheer quantity of material about her person.</div>

<div class="line_en">Some time later, I returned to my potters. In the course of my work with them, I had followed pots through all the stages of their preparation. The best way to do this, had been to make some myself. This had been greeted with the usual amusement by my instructors but had proved a useful source of knowledge on the names, for example, of techniques. Being confirmed jokers, the Dowayo potters had promised to fire my eccentric works along with their own more regular pieces the next time they did a bake. This would be the last time before the start of the rainy season -- when firing of pots was forbidden. I was particularly keen to see how one of my efforts with incised floral motifs would turn out.

Now some men would tell you dreams come from the spirits of the dead. As for himself, he was an honest man, he did not know such things. However, in case I was a believer, it was only fair to warn me that Alice had started coming back in dreams. She had had a good deal to say about the way the chief had been conducting his domestic affairs and the lack of offerings to her skull. Her principal message, however, had been for me.

<div class="line_en">It was an opportunity to turn the conversation to notions of reincarnation. The chief was concerned that one of his daughters had become pregnant at the same time that Alice had died. Normally, such a juxtaposition of death and new life is taken to show that the deceased has somehow managed to jump the queue and become reborn immediately without going through all the complex rites that the Dowayos use to shunt the dead into the category of ancestors. Since the child is expected to take many of its qualities from the dead forebear, he was visibly depressed at having a new version of Alice with him for the rest of his days. I suggested that Alice's appearance in a dream was good evidence that Alice had not yet come up for reincarnation. 'I hadn't thought of that.' Zuuldibo brightened visibly.</div>

<div class="line_en">At such moments, morale needs to be lifted. Mysteriously, I received through the postal service a periodical to which I do not subscribe. It contained, on the back page, the obituary of a minor Greek folklorist lifted to prominence by the political switchback of his country. He had died, it seemed, on the prison island where the regime housed those of whom it disapproved. The researcher in question had published data on homosexual slang in modern Athens. This was clearly what had brought him to the attention of the authorities. He had been warned. Sticking firmly to his notions of academic freedom, he had continued research and come up with the even more scandalous, 'Homosexual argot among male prostitutes'. Condemned to incarceration for bringing Greek manhood into disrepute, he had not been cowed. His study of homosexual slang in Greek prisons was published posthumously.</div>

<div class="line_en">P. Amaury Talbot is known as a punctilious researcher into Southern Nigerian ethnography. In his own arid monographs, however, there is no hint of his real talent which was clearly that of accident-prone self-mutilation. In his journey across Nigeria and Cameroon in the company of his wife and the formidable Olive MacLeod, it is striking that as the latter two wax ever more stalwart, he declines. He begins by falling from his horse on to his head. Scarce recovered, he strikes his head against a beam, 'Unfortunately in the identical place where he had injured it when thrown from his horse in the Kamerun, and the result was delirium and several days of bed.' Once more recovered, he is fed poisoned dates and nearly perishes. Back on horseback, he crashes into a cow. He is also bitten by a snake, but then so is nearly everyone. Compared to him, I was doing well. Museum Studies offers us even more edifying precursors. The indefatigable heiress, Miss Alexandrine Tinné, organized an expedition in the mid-nineteenth century to the Upper Nile that led to the deaths of her mother, aunt and their servants. Undeterred, she resolved to cross the Sahara from Tripoli to Bornu, but, taking her lesson from the earlier fatalities, hired Touareg bodyguards. They shot her.</div>

<div class="line_en">Being greatly cheered by recollections of the difference between the private and public face of anthropology, I was once more able to face the world. Matthieu and I walked down to the entrance to the village. Here all pretence at roads gave out and the mountain paths began. At the junction was the ritually important crossroad. It is not only in our own culture that crossroads are associated with all manner of beliefs. Logically they are interesting in that they have place but no extension, like a point in geometry, belonging simultaneously to several different paths. It is here that many ritually dangerous objects are disposed of in Dowayoland, a sort of convenient cultural 'nowhere' where costumes of mourning and polluting human exuviae such as hair can be dumped. To one side, had been set up several logs for the men to sit on as they made their way back from the fields. They would rest their weary bones here a while, smoke and talk. As they looked out over the country, they were drawn inevitably to more general topics and discussions of village affairs. Whereas a gathering of men inside the village would always take on the air of a law-court, gatherings outside were truly informal and 'off the record'.</div>

There certainly were leopards up in the mountains, though the last recorded one was shot over thirty years ago.

<div class="line_en">He would direct the hunt and co-ordinate the activities of the men. The most important thing was that no man should have intercourse with a woman for three days. All agreed to this. The hunter gave them a lecture on the importance of this consideration. The chief problem, it seemed, was not intercourse itself but the fact that the woman might have committed adultery with someone else. The smell of this would be communicated to the man. Dowayos never expect too much fidelity from their women and regard adulterous liaisons as an excellent sport to engage in themselves. A man so infected would be incapable of the simplest shot. His hand would shake, his eyes cloud over. His arrow would miss its mark. Worst of all, dangerous beasts of the bush would home in on him. He would be stalked by leopards and scorpions, and risked an awful death. They would smell him from miles away. He would thus be a menace to everyone.

<div class="line_en">The atmosphere in the village was rather like that in a house where several people have sworn to give up smoking at the same time and laid money on their resolve. Everyone suspects the others of cheating. Short absences invite comment, longer absences interrogation. The problem is made worse in a context where men are not allowed to admit before women that they need to defecate, since this is one of the principal reasons for men quietly slipping away unnoticed.</div>

Some men went as far as accompanying their wives down to the water-hole and back when they carried their pots down there to fill them with the green, fetid water of the late dry season. They did not, of course, help to carry the vessels.</div>

<div class="line_en">Bows are not a good thing to keep around women. The hunter's bow is the most dangerous. It can cause a woman to miscarry. Hunters therefore tend to avoid main paths and skulk around the village on long detours. If they meet a woman, they immediately lay their bows down pointing away from her and will not speak to her until this has been done. The bows of ordinary, occasional hunters are less severe in their effects though no man would be so foolish as to introduce one into a compound where there is a woman with child. Women, however, are very dangerous to them, especially when menstruating. Their effluvium is held to 'spoil' the bow and make it useless. The link in Dowayo thought seems to lie in the similarity of the different types of bleeding involved in each, hunting or menstruation. They are sufficiently similar to need to be kept rigorously apart.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="猎人的弓箭不宜接近女人。“真正猎者”的弓最危险，会让女人流产。因此他们避免走大路，而是蹑手蹑远绕村子而行。如果他们不小心遇见女人，马上得把弓放下，方向不能对着女人，放下弓后，才能与女人说话。非专业的普通猎者，他们的弓威力较小，但只有愚蠢莽汉才会带着弓进人孕妇所在的院落。虽说如此，女人对猎者也具威胁性，尤其是月经来潮时。月经的“恶臭气味”会污染弓，让它无法发挥作用。就多瓦悠人的思维，狩猎与月经这两种截然不同的活动都因会流血而产生联结。它们太过相似，因此需要严格隔离。">查看中文翻译</div>

One woman came up and gave her young husband his tobacco-pouch which he had forgotten to take with him. There was a hush. Why this good nature? Where had he left the pouch? Suspicious eyes swivelled accusingly. The hunter began to speak bitterly of the whole hunt being spoiled by selfishness and men behaving like women. The young man blushed and looked at the ground. An elder intervened. He spoke gently and sadly of the hot blood of youth, of the importunities of women who would not leave a man alone. He advised the young man to withdraw from the hunt, then no one could accuse him if anything went wrong. But he was innocent! Nevertheless, a wise man would think before continuing on this road.

He had perfected a high howl that commanded astonishment while brooking no imitation. Any living thing, one felt, would flee before that. The dogs had picked up the excitement, snarling and trying to dart ahead through our legs. Unfortunately, the dampness in the area had encouraged rank growth of thorny shrubs that seemed to have linked branches to deny us passage. It was never clear who had the idea of starting a fire but soon a long line was ablaze. It was unfortunate that the matter had not been discussed beforehand since the wind was blowing in entirely the wrong direction. We were rapidly engulfed in choking smoke and driven back by the heat of the flames. The little boys were wild-eyed with terror and began to sob. Matthieu and I hauled them up the bare stone walls and led them round to the other side of the flames. We were greeted by seven very irritated men, arrows notched to slay anything that moved. In dribs and drabs, some of the men and dogs made their way through and stood about looking disconsolate.

The others devoted themselves to smoking out bush-rats by plunging firebrands down one end of their tunnels and skewering them as they fled out the other. This was not quite fit activity for hunters, being more the sort of thing that children do. Several little boys showed themselves very adept at the more difficult parts of the operation and gave their elders instruction. As the rats were clubbed or stabbed, they urinated over their killers. Fortunately, it was not until I returned to Europe that someone told me that this is the source of the deadly disease Lassa fever. Apparently, it is caused by a virus contained in the urine of the rats to which human children are immune but which can be lethal to adults.

<div class="line_en">The way that the fire had turned back on them, the fact that the dogs had fought each other, the way that the antelope had turned into a cow -- all this argued for either adultery or witchcraft, maybe both. There was a lingering whiff of mutual suspicion in the village. Neighbours had been revealed as sexual gluttons and liars. Wives were possibly adulterous. Witches were at work.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="火往回烧、狗儿互残、羚羊变成牛，众人认为这一切不是女人通奸，就是有人施巫，要不，两者皆有。事后，村人互相猜忌的气氛久久不消。指控邻人好色无度、谎话连篇。做老婆的每个都有通矸嫌疑。而且有人施巫术。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dowayos have their good times and their bad times like everyone else. They expect a man in this world to have a mixture of good and bad fortune and do not seek too far the ultimate causes of misfortune. They have developed a whole range of devices that account more or less loosely for the complexities of what we call luck. A man may have good fortune through buying appropriate potions which he swallows or by the use of charms and spells. Bad fortune may come from witchcraft of others or the intervention of hostile ancestors. All these may mix together to make the world difficult to interpret. Ancestors may aggravate the witchcraft of a living rival. They may also interfere in the operation of divining, which is normally the only way of determining what factors are at work. A man does not expect too much certainty. What is striking is the change that may occur, within a very short time, in the way that similar events are viewed. Once suspicion of witchcraft is in the air, all the necessary evidence to confirm this belief is automatically generated.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="多瓦悠人也和世上其他人一样，日子有好有坏。他们认为人生在世是好运与厄运的混合，并不去深思厄运临头的真正原因。他们发展出一套方法，或多或少解释了我们称之为“运气”之物的复杂性。个人如果买了正确的巫术品，不管是吞服或使用咒语，都可能因此获得好运。如果别人对你施巫或者充满敌意的祖灵介入你的生活，厄运便降临。这些因素混合，世界的运作变得难以解释。敌人对你施巫，祖灵有可能使巫术更形恶化。祖灵也可能介入占卜的运作（这通常是决定厄运为何降临的方法）。一个人无法期望笃定答案。更令人吃惊的是随后而来的改变，很短的时间内，人们看待相类似的事情，眼光全变了。一旦巫术阴影罩顶，所有支撑巫术作怪的证据纷纷浮现。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The genitals of Zuuldibo's cattle became infested with worms. His son stumbled on a rocky path and twisted his ankle. Beer that should have fermented turned sour instead. All these things are a fairly regular part of life in Dowayoland and would normally invite no special comment. In the present climate, however, they were all viewed as part of the same thing, as evidence that something more general was amiss. Zuuldibo was clearly worried. One night a little boy appeared at my door asking if I had any 'roots' that could help the chief sleep. I passed on some that I had received from the local doctor during a bout of malaria but the next day Zuuldibo was fretful and explained that he had had bad dreams.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="祖帝保的牛儿生殖器感染虫儿；儿子在崎岖山路跌了一跤、扭伤脚踝；该发酵的啤酒却馊掉了。这些不过是多瓦悠兰生活的寻常小事，平日绝不会引人议论。现在的气氛下，它们全被视为环环相扣，是巫术作祟的铁证。祖帝保忧虑万分。一晚，某个小男孩出现在我茅屋前，问我有没那种可以帮助酋长入睡的“药草”。我拿了上次罹患疟疾时本地医师开给我的药给他。第二天，祖帝保形容焦躁，说做了一夜噩梦。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The next night, owls were seen near the cattle. Two of the wives started ostentatiously putting up porcupine quills and other anti-witchcraft remedies on the roofs of their huts. Owls are associated with witchcraft and Dowayos have a deep fear of them 'because of their staring eyes', the same reason they give for fear of leopards. The wives were making a fairly clear statement that they knew there was witchcraft about but they had no part in it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着当晚，牛群旁出现猫头鹰。祖帝保两个妻妾大张旗鼓将豪猪刺及其他反制巫术的东西铺在茅屋顶上。猫头鹰与巫术相连，多瓦悠人十分畏惧它们“瞪视的眼睛”，这也是他们畏惧豹子的原因。祖帝保的妻妾明白声称有人施巫，但是她们与此无涉。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A few days later, one of the women reported that the water-hole had turned green and slimy. A diviner was sent for. He was a man famous throughout Dowayoland. He would be very expensive.</div>

<div class="line_en">This is an area where an outsider has a clearly privileged status. All Dowayos agree that white men are ignorant of witchcraft. The secrets have been lost in their own country. They cannot be witches nor can they suffer from witchcraft themselves. On my previous trip, after a series of disasters involving a car crash, sickness and financial difficulty, I had suggested to a number of Dowayos that I might be the victim of a witchcraft attack. They had all laughed as at a great joke.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此时，外来者显然处于优势地位。多瓦悠人皆认为白人对巫术无所知。白人国度早已丧失巫术的秘密。白人不可能施巫，也不能受害于巫术。上次我来多瓦悠兰时，历经连串灾难——车祸生病、财务困窘。我曾向不少多瓦悠人表示我可能被人施了巫术。他们认为那是大笑话，嘲笑不已。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His appearance was a little disappointing. There were no charms and outrageous clothes, no stick in the form of a snake, no deliberate staring down of those he was speaking to. He was modest and quiet, dressed in a grey tunic. He reminded me for all the world of a consultant at a Western hospital. He called the chiefs whole family together and interrogated them on what had happened, nodding and muttering softly as he drew out their confidences. Interestingly, no one mentioned the hunt which had seemed to me the most significant event of the lot since it had structured all that was to follow. He called for a bowl of water and the women were driven out. It was set carefully before him and he blew over it several times before allowing the surface to clear. He stared intently into it for some thirty seconds. We all held our breath. He cleared his throat and everyone leaned forward to catch his words.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的样貌有点令人失望。既无符咒，也无惊人服饰或蛇形模样的拐杖，讲话时，不会故意瞪视众人。他的举止谦和安静，穿了件灰色短衣。无论如何，都让我连想起西方医院里的咨询员。他叫酋长的家人全过来，一一垂询他们发生何事，边听边点头、轻声呢喃，建立众人的信心。奇怪的，没有人提到狩猎之事，在我来看，它和运气这码子事最直接相关，影响了后续的事情发展。占卜师叫人送上一碗水，女人全部出去。水放在占卜师面前，他轻吹水面数次，直到水清无痕为止。他专注瞪视水面达三十秒。我们全屏住呼吸。他清清喉咙，每个人都倾身聆听他的话语。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We began with witchcraft. Was there witchcraft? The oracle indicated that there was. What kind was it? He named the various sorts. The oracle picked one out. Was it women? The oracle revealed that it was. Finally, by ever finer questioning, it seemed that we had got down to the level of naming names. Was it the white man? No response from the oracle. The men laughed. I broke out in a sweat. The two surfaces continued to move smoothly over each other. If the zepto stuck at any moment I would still be implicated. It seemed an unfairly long stretch of time before he moved on, like the moment in musical chairs where you have to relinquish lingering claims on one seat without any hope of reaching the next.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="问题从巫术开始。是否有人施巫？神谕说是的。什么样的巫术？占卜师念了不同巫术。神谕选出其中一种。施巫者是女人吗？神谕说是的。现在进入最精细的阶段，要开始一一念出涉嫌施巫的人是白人吗？神谕没反应。众人失笑。我则冒了一身冷汗。两段扎布托继续平滑搓揉，如果它们断了或沾黏，我便成为涉嫌人。在占卜师继续下一个步骤前，时间似乎无比漫长，这就像玩大风吹游戏你必须放弃眼前的椅子，却没把握音乐响起，待会儿还能抢到椅子坐。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It seemed this was a difficult case. He would use the zepto oracle. Aah. He dug in his little leather bag and pulled out some sections of the rectangular cactus-like plant. Two slices were cut and the session began. It seemed wrong that this should happen in broad daylight, with sunshine streaming through the door of the hut. It seemed to call for flickering firelight and dramatic shadows transforming faces into theatrical props. Everything was totally matter-of-fact. We were watching a man in command of his subject. He inspired confidence. The motions of his hands were spare and precise. The divination consists of rubbing together two slices of the plant and asking questions the while. The plant sections stick or go into holes when the significant question has been asked. New sections of zepto are taken and the questioning is continued.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="显然这是个复杂判例。他将启用扎布托（zepto）神谕法（1）。他伸手到小小的皮革袋里翻捡，拿出几段长形、仙人掌式的植物。他切下两段扎布托，开始请示神谕。这样的仪式发生在大白天、阳光从门口直射入茅屋内，没有昏暗闪烁的火光，也没有戏剧化的阴影将人脸变成舞台道具。一切都是这么稀松平常。眼前这个男人颇能掌握群众，激发众人的信心。他搓揉扎布托的动作十分简约与精准扎布托神谕法是搓揉两段扎布托，一边问问题。如果占卜者问到正确问题，扎布托就会断掉或沾黏在一起。接着，占卜者就换上新的扎布托，继续问问题。【注：（1）在第一部《小泥屋笔记》里，作者提到多瓦悠人用扎布托这种植物占卜，放在指尖搓揉，口中喊着忠者可能罹患的各种病名。扎布托断了，当时所叫的病名就是正确疾病。接着占卜者再用同样方法找出致病因子是巫术、祖灵还是其他原因。最后才用同样方法确定疗法。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dowayos know, of course, that diviners can cheat and manipulate the oracle. One expects to pay for quality, not just of the man himself but of the power of his plant. To identify me as the source of the witchcraft would gravely undermine his audience's faith in his reliability.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="多瓦悠人当然知道占卜师可能会欺骗或操纵神谕。想要得到好服务（不管是占卜师或扎布托的威力），就必须付钱。神谕如果指出我是施巫人，会严重影响众人对占卜师的信心。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A woman in the next compound was picked out as the culprit. Contrary to expectation, the diviner did not stop here. He took two new slices of plant. Were there spirits active? There were. Aah, this was a complicated case. The audience nodded approval. Indeed, this was a good man. All patients like to be told that their disease is special, that it stretches the skill of the healer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="结果，神谕指出隔壁院落某女人是祸首。但是占卜师并未就此打住。他拿出两段新的扎布托。祖灵也在这件事插了一脚吗？是的。嗯！这个案子很复杂呢。群众频频点头。这占卜师真是个好人。病人的心态总是希望自己的病越特别越好，如此，疗者也才有机会尽展本事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The diviner came up with another name, a long-dead woman with no history of molestation of her kin. It was as if he lost his audience at this point. They began shaking their heads and exchanging glances. He felt it too. He began to work faster and produced some fairly fancy material on the actual demands made by the deceased. But he had lost credibility. An attempt to return to the witchcraft of the alleged miscreant in the next compound flopped badly. No one seemed convinced any more.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是占卜师却说出另一个人名。一个死掉已久且从无侵扰子孙纪录的女人。从这刻起，占卜师失去群众信任。他们开始大摇其头，交换眼神。占卜师感觉到了。搓揉扎布托的动作越来越快，提出连串捣乱亡灵要求的供祭物品。但是他的威严已失。企图将一切厄运归咎隔壁院落女人施巫，也失效了。众人不再相信他的话。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It came as no surprise that a couple of days later, some of the men arranged for Zuuldibo's father-in-law, also a skilled zepto-slicer, to run another session. Being more attuned to local conditions, he came up with the answer that it was all due to Alice and her interfering ways. Confirmation of this diagnosis came later that night. Another man dreamed that Alice appeared and explained at some length the nature of her grievance. Normally the dead just complain generally of neglect. They have received no offerings of beer or blood. No attempts have been made to organize the ceremonies that make them available for reincarnation. Alice was rather different. Just as in life she had not limited her attention to those matters that might be viewed as strictly her own business, so in death she allowed herself to range widely over the doings of her descendants. She was apparently scandalized that her nephew, Zuuldibo, was not doing more to further the projected circumcision. Her youngest son‚ though married, was still uncut. She wanted something done about it. I felt that at last she had become an ally.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="毫不意外，几天后，众人安排了祖帝保的岳父（也是一个熟练的扎布托占卜师）再来占一次卜。由于他对此地状况颇熟，断言切都是爱丽丝性好干预在作怪。他的诊断稍后得到证实。爱丽丝当晚出现在某村人梦境，长篇大论诉说自己的痛苦。通常亡灵的抱怨都是指控子孙疏忽供奉，忘了献祭啤酒与鲜血。或者子孙不筹办仪式让他们可以顺利转世投胎。但是爱丽丝的抱怨颇不同。一如生前，她关切的不仅是自家门前雪，死后，还要广泛插手子孙的各种事物。她指控她的外甥祖帝保没有尽力推动割礼仪式，让她蒙羞，因为她最小的儿子已结婚多年，却到现在仍未行割礼。她要祖帝保赶快去办。总算有一次，爱丽丝与我同一阵线。">查看中文翻译</div>
