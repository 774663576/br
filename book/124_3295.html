<div class="line_en">Augustus Waters drove horrifically. Whether stopping or starting, everything happened with a tremendous JOLT. I flew against the seat belt of his Toyota SUV each time he braked, and my neck snapped backward each time he hit the gas. I might have been nervous -- what with sitting in the car of a strange boy on the way to his house, keenly aware that my crap lungs complicate efforts to fend off unwanted advances -- but his driving was so astonishingly poor that I could think of nothing else.</div>

<div class="line_en">He laughed, nodding. "Well, I can't feel pressure in old Prosty, and I can't get the hang of driving left-footed. My doctors say most amputees can drive with no problem, but… yeah. Not me. Anyway, I go in for my fourth driving test, and it goes about like this is going." A half mile in front of us, a light turned red. Augustus slammed on the brakes, tossing me into the triangular embrace of the seat belt. "Sorry. I swear to God I am trying to be gentle. Right, so anyway, at the end of the test, I totally thought I'd failed again, but the instructor was like, 'Your driving is unpleasant, but it isn't technically unsafe.'"</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我可不确定持相同意见。”我说，“我怀疑这是癌症福利。”‘癌症福利’是那些普通孩子没有但患癌症的孩子能得到的小小特权：体育明星签名的篮球啦，迟交作业也可以啦，考不过也能发驾照啦什么的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I had a surgery called radical neck dissection, which is about as pleasant as it sounds. Then radiation. Then they tried some chemo for my lung tumors. The tumors shrank, then grew. By then, I was fourteen. My lungs started to fill up with water. I was looking pretty dead -- my hands and feet ballooned; my skin cracked; my lips were perpetually blue. They've got this drug that makes you not feel so completely terrified about the fact that you can't breathe, and I had a lot of it flowing into me through a PICC line, and more than a dozen other drugs besides. But even so, there's a certain unpleasantness to drowning, particularly when it occurs over the course of several months. I finally ended up in the ICU with pneumonia, and my mom knelt by the side of my bed and said, "Are you ready, sweetie?" and I told her I was ready, and my dad just kept telling me he loved me in this voice that was not breaking so much as already broken, and I kept telling him that I loved him, too, and everyone was holding hands, and I couldn't catch my breath, and my lungs were acting desperate, gasping, pulling me out of the bed trying to find a position that could get them air, and I was embarrassed by their desperation, disgusted that they wouldn't just let go, and I remember my mom telling me it was okay, that I was okay, that I would be okay, and my father was trying so hard not to sob that when he did, which was regularly, it was an earthquake. And I remember wanting not to be awake.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我做了个叫作“根治性颈部清除术”的手术，手术几乎和名字一样令人振奋。接着是放疗。然后，他们针对我的肺部肿瘤试验了一些化学药物，肿瘤缩小了，可后来又长大了。那时候我十四岁了。我的肺开始积满水。我当时看起来命在旦夕——双手双脚都像吹气球一样肿起来，皮肤开裂，嘴唇永远是紫的。医生给我用了一种药，让我不至于被自己无法呼吸这个事实吓死，于是这种药大剂量地通过一根PICC中心导管注入我的身体，此外还有十几种别的药。可即便如此，我还是有一种快要淹死的感觉，这非常令人不快，特别是这种状况持续了好几个月。最后，我还是因为肺炎进了重症监护室（ICU），妈妈跪在我床边说：“你准备好了吗，宝贝？”然后我说我准备好了，然后爸爸不停地对我说他爱我，他的声音都变了，支离破碎。我也一直跟他说我也爱他，我们都手拉着手，我喘不上气来，我的肺绝望地倒抽着气，逼迫我从床上起来，寻找一个可以供给它空气的姿势，我被它的绝望弄得很窘迫，很反感——它为什么就不肯放弃？我还记得妈妈对我说没事，我没事了，我会没事的，爸爸费了那么大的劲忍住呜咽，可他还是经常忍不住，他呜咽起来就像一场地震。我还记得我希望自己再也不要醒来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I woke up and soon got into one of those experimental trials that are famous in the Republic of Cancervania for Not Working.

<div class="line_en">I followed him inside. A wooden plaque in the entryway was engraved in cursive with the words Home Is Where the Heart Is, and the entire house turned out to be festooned in such observations. Good Friends Are Hard to Find and Impossible to Forget read an illustration above the coatrack. True Love Is Born from Hard Times promised a needlepointed pillow in their antique-furnished living room. Augustus saw me reading. "My parents call them Encouragements," he explained. "They're everywhere."</div>

<div class="line_en">His mom and dad called him Gus. They were making enchiladas in the kitchen (a piece of stained glass by the sink read in bubbly letters Family Is Forever). His mom was putting chicken into tortillas, which his dad then rolled up and placed in a glass pan. They didn't seem too surprised by my arrival, which made sense: The fact that Augustus made me feel special did not necessarily indicate that I was special. Maybe he brought home a different girl every night to show her movies and feel her up.</div>
