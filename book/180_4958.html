<div class="line_en">She seemed to have shrivelled slightly, he thought. She looked a little skimpy, wispy; but not unattractive. He liked her. There had been some talk of her marrying William Bankes once, but nothing had come of it. His wife had been fond of her. He had been a little out of temper too at breakfast. And then, and then -- this was one of those moments when an enormous need urged him, without being conscious what it was, to approach any woman, to force them, he did not care how, his need was so great, to give him what he wanted: sympathy.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh, thanks, everything," said Lily Briscoe nervously. No; she could not do it. She ought to have floated off instantly upon some wave of sympathetic expansion: the pressure on her was tremendous. But she remained stuck. There was an awful pause. They both looked at the sea. Why, thought Mr Ramsay, should she look at the sea when I am here? She hoped it would be calm enough for them to land at the Lighthouse, she said. The Lighthouse! The Lighthouse! What's that got to do with it? he thought impatiently. Instantly, with the force of some primeval gust (for really he could not restrain himself any longer), there issued from him such a groan that any other woman in the whole world would have done something, said something -- all except myself, thought Lily, girding at herself bitterly, who am not a woman, but a peevish, ill-tempered, dried-up old maid, presumably.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“啊，谢谢，都有了，”莉莉·布里斯柯不安地说。不行，她做不到。她本应该马上随着大大扩展起来的同情之浪漂过去：她受到的压力太大了。伯是她却定住了一动不动。一段难堪的沉默。俩人都看着大海。拉姆齐先生心想，我在这里她为什么还要看着大海？她说她希望海面平静，他们好登上灯塔。灯塔！灯塔！它有什么相干？他不耐烦地想道。立刻，带着一种原始的迸发力（因为他实在无法再克制住自己了）从他嘴里发出一声呻吟，世界上任何别的女人听到了都会做点什么、说点什么的——只有我不会，莉莉想，辛酸地自嘲道，我不是个女人，看来只是一个乖戾的、坏脾气的、干瘪的老处女而已。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mr Ramsay sighed to the full. He waited. Was she not going to say anything? Did she not see what he wanted from her? Then he said he had a particular reason for wanting to go to the Lighthouse. His boy with a tuberculous hip, the lightkeeper's son. He sighed profoundly. He sighed significantly. All Lily wished was that this enormous flood of grief, this insatiable hunger for sympathy, this demand that she should surrender herself up to him entirely, and even so he had sorrows enough to keep her supplied for ever, should leave her, should be diverted (she kept looking at the house, hoping for an interruption) before it swept her down in its flow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="拉姆齐先生深深地长叹了一口气。他等待着。难道她不打算说些什么吗？难道她不明白他想从她那儿得到的是什么吗？于是他说，他想去灯塔是有着特殊的原因的。他妻子过去总是给他们送东西去。那儿有个得股骨结核的可怜的孩子，是灯塔看守人的儿子。他深沉地叹了口气。他意味深长地叹了口气。莉莉只希望这股巨大的伤心的洪流、这种永远无法满足的对同情的贪欲、这种认为她应该完全屈服于他的要求——尽管他的忧伤多得足以永远供她同情——远远离开她，在这股洪流把她卷走之前（她不断向房子看去，希望出现什么来打断这个局面）被引到别的方向去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Such expeditions," said Mr Ramsay, scraping the ground with his toe, "are very painful." Still Lily said nothing. (She is a stock, she is a stone, he said to himself.) "They are very exhausting," he said, looking, with a sickly look that nauseated her (he was acting, she felt, this great man was dramatising himself), at his beautiful hands. It was horrible, it was indecent. Would they never come, she asked, for she could not sustain this enormous weight of sorrow, support these heavy draperies of grief (he had assumed a pose of extreme decreptitude; he even tottered a little as he stood there) a moment longer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这样的远游，”拉姆齐先生一面用脚尖刮着地，一面说道，“是很痛苦的。”莉莉仍然一声不响。（她是块木头墩子，她是块顽石，他对自己说。）“它们很累人的，”他说，用令她恶心的黯然神伤的表情（她感到他在演戏，这位大人物在引人注目）看着他优雅的双手。这真可怕。这真失礼。他们怎么还不出来？她问道，因为她再也无法继续承受这悲哀的重负，再也无法继续支撑这伤感的沉重的帐幕了（他摆出极其衰老的姿态；站在那里时甚至有点站不住的样子）。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Still she could say nothing; the whole horizon seemed swept bare of objects to talk about; could only feel, amazedly, as Mr Ramsay stood there, how his gaze seemed to fall dolefully over the sunny grass and discolour it, and cast over the rubicund, drowsy, entirely contented figure of Mr Carmichael, reading a French novel on a deck-chair, a veil of crape, as if such an existence, flaunting its prosperity in a world of woe, were enough to provoke the most dismal thoughts of all. Look at him, he seemed to be saying, look at me; and indeed, all the time he was feeling, Think of me, think of me. Ah, could that bulk only be wafted alongside of them, Lily wished; had she only pitched her easel a yard or two closer to him; a man, any man, would staunch this effusion, would stop these lamentations. A woman, she had provoked this horror; a woman, she should have known how to deal with it. It was immensely to her discredit, sexually, to stand there dumb. One said -- what did one say?-- Oh, Mr Ramsay! Dear Mr Ramsay! That was what that kind old lady who sketched, Mrs Beckwith, would have said instantly, and rightly. But, no. They stood there, isolated from the rest of the world. His immense self-pity, his demand for sympathy poured and spread itself in pools at ther feet, and all she did, miserable sinner that she was, was to draw her skirts a little closer round her ankles, lest she should get wet. In complete silence she stood there, grasping her paint brush.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而她还是什么也说不出来；极目所到之处似乎被清扫一空，没有可供谈论的东西；她只是惊愕地感到，拉姆齐先生站在那里时，他的目光悲哀地落在阳光照射的青草上，使草似乎也失去了颜色，并且给在折叠躺椅里看法国小说的那个脸色红润、懒洋洋的、心满意足的卡迈克尔先生的身影也蒙上了一层黑色的丧纱，仿佛在这个悲苦的世界里，一个炫耀自己的幸运的人的存在足以挑起人们最凄凉忧郁的思想。看看他，他似乎在说，看看我；真的，他的感觉一直都是，想想我吧，想想我吧。啊，要是那个大块头能飘到他们身边来就好了，莉莉心里在希望；要是她把画架支得离他近一两码该多好；一个男人，任何男人，都会终止这种感情的倾泻，停止这类悲叹。作为一个女人，她激起了这可怕的一幕；作为一个女人，她本该知道如何应付这个局面。像这样一句话也说不出来地站在这里，作为女人真是件丢脸透顶的事。她应该说——该说些什么？——啊，拉姆齐先生！亲爱的拉姆齐先生！那位画素描的好心的老太太贝克威斯夫人肯定立刻就会这样恰当地说出来的。可是莉莉不行。他们站在那里，和整个世界都隔绝开了。他那强烈的自艾自怜，他对同情的需求倾泻扩散，在她脚边形成了个个水坑，而她这个糟糕的罪人只会把裙子提到脚脖子上面，免得弄湿了。她沉默着站在那里，手里紧抓着画笔。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"What beautiful boots!" she exclaimed. She was ashamed of herself. To praise his boots when he asked her to solace his soul; when he had shown her his bleeding hands, his lacerated heart, and asked her to pity them, then to say, cheerfully, "Ah, but what beautiful boots you wear!" deserved, she knew, and she looked up expecting to get it in one of his sudden roars of ill-temper complete annihilation.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“多漂亮的皮靴！”她惊叹道。她为自己感到羞愧。在他要求她安慰他的心灵的时候却云赞扬他的靴子；当他向她伸出了流血的双手、显露了备受折磨的心、要求得到她的同情时，却愉快地说，“啊，可是你的靴子多漂亮呀！”她知道他有理由大发脾气，把她说得一钱不值，于是就抬起头来等待他发作。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Heaven could never be sufficiently praised! She heard sounds in the house. James and Cam must be coming. But Mr Ramsay, as if he knew that his time ran short, exerted upon her solitary figure the immense pressure of his concentrated woe; his age; his frailty: his desolation; when suddenly, tossing his head impatiently, in his annoyance -- for after all, what woman could resist him?-- he noticed that his boot-laces were untied. Remarkable boots they were too, Lily thought, looking down at them: sculptured; colossal; like everything that Mr Ramsay wore, from his frayed tie to his half-buttoned waistcoat, his own indisputably. She could see them walking to his room of their own accord, expressive in his absence of pathos, surliness, ill-temper, charm.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="感谢老天！她听见房子里传出了声音。詹姆斯和卡姆想必就要出来了。但是拉姆齐先生似乎知道他的时间不多了，便把浓缩在一起的他的悲哀、他的年纪、他的虚弱、他的孤寂所形成的巨大压力一股脑儿地压在她那孤零零的身体上。而突然他又生气地把头不耐烦地往后一仰——因为，毕竟哪个女人能抵制得了他的魅力？——他注意到自己的靴子带散开了。这还真是双出色的靴子，莉莉低头看着靴子，心里在想：一双巨大的雕花皮靴；和拉姆齐先生身上穿的每件东西一样，从磨损的领带到半扣着的背心，毫无疑义都带有他个人的特征。她能想像它们自己往他的房间里走去，没有拉姆齐先生它们也会表现出他的悲怅、乖戾、暴躁，他的魅力。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Instead, Mr Ramsay smiled. His pall, his draperies, his infirmities fell from him. Ah, yes, he said, holding his foot up for her to look at, they were first-rate boots. There was only one man in England who could make boots like that. Boots are among the chief curses of mankind, he said. "Bootmakers make it their business," he exclaimed, "to cripple and torture the human foot." They are also the most obstinate and perverse of mankind. It had taken him the best part of his youth to get boots made as they should be made. He would have her observe (he lifted his right foot and then his left) that she had never seen boots made quite that shape before. They were made of the finest leather in the world, also. Most leather was mere brown paper and cardboard. He looked complacently at his foot, still held in the air. They had reached, she felt, a sunny island where peace dwelt, sanity reigned and the sun for ever shone, the blessed island of good boots. Her heart warmed to him. "Now let me see if you can tie a knot," he said. He poohpoohed her feeble system. He showed her his own invention. Once you tied it, it never came undone. Three times he knotted her shoe; three times he unknotted it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是拉姆齐先生反而笑了。那阴郁的、像蒙着层层帐幕的脸色和虚弱之态从他身上蜕脱掉了。啊，是的，他说着抬起脚让她看他的靴子，这是第一流的靴子。在英国只有一个人会做这样的靴子。靴子是人类的主要祸根之一，他说。“制靴匠，”他声称，“的宗旨就是折磨和弄残人脚。”他们还是人类中最顽固最违反常情的家伙。他青年时期大半时间都花在找人做出按应该的做法来做的靴子上了。他要她注意到（他抬起右脚，然后又抬起左脚），她以前从来没有看见过形状做得和这双一样的靴子。而且还是用世界上最好的皮子做的。大多数的皮子和牛皮纸或硬纸板差不多。他得意地看着自已仍然高高跷起的脚。她感到他们来到了一个阳光明媚的岛上，这里是和平的世界，由健全的神智所统治，阳光永远照耀，这座上帝赐福的好靴子岛。她对他产生了好感。“让我来看看你会不会系鞋带。”他说。他对她那个不结实的系法大不以为然，用自己创造的法子系给她看。一旦系好了，就永远不会散开；他三次系好她的鞋带，又三次把它解开。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But why was it like THAT that they came? She could not help feeling annoyed with them; they might have come more cheerfully; they might have given him what, now that they were off, she would not have the chance of giving him. For she felt a sudden emptiness; a frustration. Her feeling had come too late; there it was ready; but he no longer needed it. He had become a very distinguished, elderly man, who had no need of her whatsoever. She felt snubbed. He slung a knapsack round his shoulders. He shared out the parcels -- there were a number of them, ill tied in brown paper. He sent Cam for a cloak. He had all the appearance of a leader making ready for an expedition. Then, wheeling about, he led the way with his firm military tread, in those wonderful boots, carrying brown paper parcels, down the path, his children following him. They looked, she thought, as if fate had devoted them to some stern enterprise, and they went to it, still young enough to be drawn acquiescent in their father's wake, obediently, but with a pallor in their eyes which made her feel that they suffered something beyond their years in silence. So they passed the edge of the lawn, and it seemed to Lily that she watched a procession go, drawn on by some stress of common feeling which made it, faltering and flagging as it was, a little company bound together and strangely impressive to her. Politely, but very distantly, Mr Ramsay raised his hand and saluted her as they passed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是他们为什么要带着这么一副样子走过来？她不禁感到有点不高兴；他们可以快活一点；现在他们要出发了，她自己没有机会给予他的东两，他们可以给他；她这时突然感到一阵空落落的；一阵灰心大意。她的感情来得太晚了；现在这份感情出现了；但他已不再需要了。他变成了一个有身份的老人，根本不需要她了。她觉得受到了冷落。他把一只背包行肩上一背，把小包分给大家拿看着——有好几个捆得不怎么样的牛皮纸包呢。他打发卡姆去拿件斗篷。他看上去完全像个为远征作准备的队长。然后他掉转身去，穿着那双出色的靴子，踏着坚定的军人的步伐，抱着牛皮纸包，领头沿小路走去，孩子们跟在后面。她觉得两个孩子看上去像是被命运奉献给了某种严峻艰巨的事业，而他们顺从地去了，他们年纪还不大，还能默然追随在父亲的身后，但他们神色黯淡的眼睛却使她感到他们在无言地忍受着某种超出了他们年龄的痛苦。就这样他们走出了草坪，莉莉觉得自己似乎在看着一支队伍前进，尽管步履不很坚定，劲头不很足，但靠着某种共同的感情的力量的驱使，他们组成了一个小小的连队，给了她奇特而强烈的印象。他们走出草坪时，拉姆齐先生有礼貌地但十分冷淡地举起一只手向她致意。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Why, at this completely inappropriate moment, when he was stooping over her shoe, should she be so tormented with sympathy for him that, as she stooped too, the blood rushed to her face, and, thinking of her callousness (she had called him a play-actor) she felt her eyes swell and tingle with tears? Thus occupied he seemed to her a figure of infinite pathos. He tied knots. He bought boots. There was no helping Mr Ramsay on the journey he was going. But now just as she wished to say something, could have said something, perhaps, here they were -- Cam and James. They appeared on the terrace. They came, lagging, side by side, a serious, melancholy couple.</div>

<div class="line_en">But what a face, she thought, immediately finding the sympathy which she had not been asked to give troubling her for expression. What had made it like that? Thinking, night after night, she supposed -- about the reality of kitchen tables, she added, remembering the symbol which in her vagueness as to what Mr Ramsay did think about Andrew had given her. (He had been killed by the splinter of a shell instantly, she bethought her.) The kitchen table was something visionary, austere; something bare, hard, not ornamental. There was no colour to it; it was all edges and angles; it was uncompromisingly plain. But Mr Ramsay kept always his eyes fixed upon it, never allowed himself to be distracted or deluded, until his face became worn too and ascetic and partook of this unornamented beauty which so deeply impressed her. Then, she recalled (standing where he had left her, holding her brush), worries had fretted it -- not so nobly. He must have had his doubts about that table, she supposed; whether the table was a real table; whether it was worth the time he gave to it; whether he was able after all to find it. He had had doubts, she felt, or he would have asked less of people. That was what they talked about late at night sometimes, she suspected; and then next day Mrs Ramsay looked tired, and Lily flew into a rage with him over some absurd little thing. But now he had nobody to talk to about that table, or his boots, or his knots; and he was like a lion seeking whom he could devour, and his face had that touch of desperation, of exaggeration in it which alarmed her, and made her pull her skirts about her. And then, she recalled, there was that sudden revivification, that sudden flare (when she praised his boots), that sudden recovery of vitality and interest in ordinary human things, which too passed and changed (for he was always changing, and hid nothing) into that other final phase which was new to her and had, she owned, made herself ashamed of her own irritability, when it seemed as if he had shed worries and ambitions, and the hope of sympathy and the desire for praise, had entered some other region, was drawn on, as if by curiosity, in dumb colloquy, whether with himself or another, at the head of that little procession out of one's range. An extraordinary face! The gate banged.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但这是怎样的一张脸啊，她心里想，立刻发现并没有人向她索取的同情使她苦恼，想要得到表达。是什么使这张脸成为这个样子的？是一夜又一夜的思考，她猜想——思考关于厨房桌子的现实性吧，她记起了在她不清楚拉姆齐先生究竟想些什么的时候，安德鲁当时给她的那个象征性回答。（她想到，他被炮弹的碎片击中，当场就死了。）厨桌是某种想像中的、严肃的东西；某种赤裸的、坚硬的、非装饰性的东西。它并不多彩；棱角分明；绝对的平淡无奇。但是拉姆齐先生总是盯着它，决不允许自己的注意力被分散或受到欺骗，直到他的脸变得疲惫严峻，具有了这种深深打动她的朴实本真的美。这时她又想起（她仍站在他离去时她站的地方、手里拿着画笔），烦恼也侵蚀了他的脸——一些不太高尚的烦恼。她猜想，关于那张厨桌的思考他一定也有过疑虑；那张桌子是否真实；他花在它身上的时间是否值得；他究竟能否找到什么结果。他有疑虑，她觉得，不然他就不会对别人有这么多的需求。她疑心他们有时深夜所谈的就是这些；于是第二天拉姆齐夫人就显得很疲倦，而莉莉就会为某件可笑的小事对他发火。但是现在没有人和他谈那张桌子了，或是谈他的靴子、他怎么打结；他像只狮子寻找能够吞食的猎物，他脸上的那一丝绝望和夸张的表情使她惊恐，使她拉紧裙子裹住自己。接着她回想起他突然恢复了生气（当她夸他的靴子时），突然振奋起来，突然恢复了活力和对于普通的凡人小事的兴趣，但这些也迅即消失改变（因为他总是在变，从不掩饰），变成了她从没见过的最后的那个样子，她承认，这使她对自己的烦躁易怒感到羞耻，因为他似乎已经摆脱了烦恼和奢望，不再希望得到同情和称赞，进入了另一个境界，仿佛被好奇心所吸引，和自己或别人进行着无声的交谈，在她目力不能及之处走在那小小的队伍前面。真是一张非同寻常的脸！园门砰地一声关上了。">查看中文翻译</div>
