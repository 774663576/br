<div class="line_en">Mr. Elton must now be left to himself. It was no longer in Emma's power to superintend his happiness or quicken his measures. The coming of her sister's family was so very near at hand, that first in anticipation, and then in reality, it became henceforth her prime object of interest; and during the ten days of their stay at Hartfield it was not to be expected -- she did not herself expect -- that any thing beyond occasional, fortuitous assistance could be afforded by her to the lovers. They might advance rapidly if they would, however; they must advance somehow or other whether they would or no. She hardly wished to have more leisure for them. There are people, who the more you do for them, the less they will do for themselves.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley, from having been longer than usual absent from Surry, were exciting of course rather more than the usual interest. Till this year, every long vacation since their marriage had been divided between Hartfield and Donwell Abbey; but all the holidays of this autumn had been given to sea-bathing for the children, and it was therefore many months since they had been seen in a regular way by their Surry connexions, or seen at all by Mr. Woodhouse, who could not be induced to get so far as London, even for poor Isabella's sake; and who consequently was now most nervously and apprehensively happy in forestalling this too short visit.</div>

<div class="line_en">He thought much of the evils of the journey for her, and not a little of the fatigues of his own horses and coachman who were to bring some of the party the last half of the way; but his alarms were needless; the sixteen miles being happily accomplished, and Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley, their five children, and a competent number of nursery-maids, all reaching Hartfield in safety. The bustle and joy of such an arrival, the many to be talked to, welcomed, encouraged, and variously dispersed and disposed of, produced a noise and confusion which his nerves could not have borne under any other cause, nor have endured much longer even for this; but the ways of Hartfield and the feelings of her father were so respected by Mrs. John Knightley, that in spite of maternal solicitude for the immediate enjoyment of her little ones, and for their having instantly all the liberty and attendance, all the eating and drinking, and sleeping and playing, which they could possibly wish for, without the smallest delay, the children were never allowed to be long a disturbance to him, either in themselves or in any restless attendance on them.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mrs. John Knightley was a pretty, elegant little woman, of gentle, quiet manners, and a disposition remarkably amiable and affectionate; wrapt up in her family; a devoted wife, a doating mother, and so tenderly attached to her father and sister that, but for these higher ties, a warmer love might have seemed impossible. She could never see a fault in any of them. She was not a woman of strong understanding or any quickness; and with this resemblance of her father, she inherited also much of his constitution; was delicate in her own health, over-careful of that of her children, had many fears and many nerves, and was as fond of her own Mr. Wingfield in town as her father could be of Mr. Perry. They were alike too, in a general benevolence of temper, and a strong habit of regard for every old acquaintance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="约翰·奈特利夫人是个娇小娟秀的妇女，举止优雅娴静，性情极其温柔，一心顾着她那个家，对丈夫忠心耿耿，对子女娇宠溺爱；对父亲和妹妹也情深意切，若不是因为跟丈夫孩子关系更亲一些，她似乎不可能更热烈地爱他们。她从来看不到他们有什么缺点。她不是个聪明伶俐的女人，不仅在这一点上像她父亲，而且还在很大程度上遗传了她父亲的体魄。她身体虚弱，也极其当心孩子们的身体，成天担惊受怕，紧紧张张，十分喜爱她在伦敦的医生温菲尔德先生，就像她父亲厚爱佩里先生一样。他们父女俩还有一个相似之处：对任何人都心地慈善，对老朋友更是一往情深。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mr. John Knightley was a tall, gentleman-like, and very clever man; rising in his profession, domestic, and respectable in his private character; but with reserved manners which prevented his being generally pleasing; and capable of being sometimes out of humour. He was not an ill-tempered man, not so often unreasonably cross as to deserve such a reproach; but his temper was not his great perfection; and, indeed, with such a worshipping wife, it was hardly possible that any natural defects in it should not be increased. The extreme sweetness of her temper must hurt his. He had all the clearness and quickness of mind which she wanted, and he could sometimes act an ungracious, or say a severe thing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="约翰·奈特利先生是个身材高大、风度翩翩、头脑聪敏的男人。他事业蒸蒸日上，顾惜家庭生活，为人十分体面。不过，由于举止拘谨的缘故，他又不讨众人喜欢，有时还会发发脾气。他并不常常无端发火，因而算不上性情乖戾。不过，他的性情也不是他的尽善尽美之处。他有个崇拜他的妻子，他性情上那些先天的缺陷，难免不因此得到助长。他妻子生性极其温柔，这势必会损害他的性情。他头脑机灵敏锐，这是他妻子所缺乏的。他有时能做出一桩没有气量的事，说两句刻薄的话。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He was not a great favourite with his fair sister-in-law. Nothing wrong in him escaped her. She was quick in feeling the little injuries to Isabella, which Isabella never felt herself. Perhaps she might have passed over more had his manners been flattering to Isabella's sister, but they were only those of a calmly kind brother and friend, without praise and without blindness; but hardly any degree of personal compliment could have made her regardless of that greatest fault of all in her eyes which he sometimes fell into, the want of respectful forbearance towards her father. There he had not always the patience that could have been wished. Mr. Woodhouse's peculiarities and fidgetiness were sometimes provoking him to a rational remonstrance or sharp retort equally ill-bestowed. It did not often happen; for Mr. John Knightley had really a great regard for his father-in-law, and generally a strong sense of what was due to him; but it was too often for Emma's charity, especially as there was all the pain of apprehension frequently to be endured, though the offence came not. The beginning, however, of every visit displayed none but the properest feelings, and this being of necessity so short might be hoped to pass away in unsullied cordiality. They had not been long seated and composed when Mr. Woodhouse, with a melancholy shake of the head and a sigh, called his daughter's attention to the sad change at Hartfield since she had been there last.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他那个漂亮的小姨子并不很喜欢他，他有什么过失都逃不过她的眼睛。他做了对不起伊莎贝拉的小事，伊莎贝拉是从来察觉不了的，她却能敏锐地觉察到。也许，他的仪态若是能讨爱玛喜欢一些，爱玛说不定会多体谅一些他的毛病。可惜他只摆出一副不冷不热的姐夫和朋友的姿态，既不吹吹捧捧，也不贸然行事。然而，不管他对爱玛如何恭敬，爱玛都难以无视他不时显露的一个缺陷，她认为这是他最大的缺陷：对她父亲缺乏应有的包涵。在需要宽容的时候，他并非总是表现得很有耐心。伍德豪斯先生有些怪癖，经常坐立不安，有时惹得他或是以理相劝，或是厉声反驳两句。这种事倒不经常发生，因为约翰·奈特利先生毕竟十分敬重他的岳父，通常也知道应该如何待他。可是对于爱玛来说，做女婿的还是说得太多，因而不能宽容他；特别是，即便约翰·奈特利先生没有说出什么不得体的话，但是爱玛往往因为怕他出言不逊，而搞得提心吊胆。然而，约翰·奈特利先生每次来到岳父家，起初总是表现得恭恭敬敬．而这次既然只能住几天，兴许可望过得相安无事。等大家坐定之后，伍德豪斯先生伤心地摇了摇头，叹了口气，向女儿说起了她走后哈特菲尔德发生的不幸变化。">查看中文翻译</div>

I believe he is one of the very best-tempered men that ever existed. Excepting yourself and your brother, I do not know his equal for temper. I shall never forget his flying Henry's kite for him that very windy day last Easter -- and ever since his particular kindness last September twelvemonth in writing that note, at twelve o'clock at night, on purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at Cobham, I have been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor a better man in existence. -- If any body can deserve him, it must be Miss Taylor.'</div>
