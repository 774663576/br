<div class="line_en">"I cannot tell," was the answer, "for I have never been to the Emerald City. But my father went there once, when I was a boy, and he said it was a long journey through a dangerous country, although nearer to the city where Oz dwells the country is beautiful. But I am not afraid so long as I have my oil-can, and nothing can hurt the Scarecrow, while you bear upon your forehead the mark of the Good Witch's kiss, and that will protect you from harm."</div>

<div class="line_en">There were few birds in this part of the forest, for birds love the open country where there is plenty of sunshine. But now and then there came a deep growl from some wild animal hidden among the trees. These sounds made the little girl's heart beat fast, for she did not know what made them; but Toto knew, and he walked close to Dorothy's side, and did not even bark in return.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在这一带的树林中，鸟儿很少，因为它们喜欢空旷和阳光充足的地方。但是在这树林中有野兽躲藏着，不时传来深长的吼声。这些声音，使得小女孩子的心，受到沉重的打击，因为她不知道是什么东西在叫。但是托托知道的，它靠紧着多萝茜的身旁走，不敢用吠声去回答。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Little Toto, now that he had an enemy to face, ran barking toward the Lion, and the great beast had opened his mouth to bite the dog, when Dorothy, fearing Toto would be killed, and heedless of danger, rushed forward and slapped the Lion upon his nose as hard as she could, while she cried out: "Don't you dare to bite Toto! You ought to be ashamed of yourself, a big beast like you, to bite a poor little dog!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在，小托托面对着这个仇敌，跑上前去向狮子吠着，这只大野兽就张开它的嘴去咬这只小狗。这时候，多萝茜害怕托托会被咬死，不顾危险，冲向前去，尽力猛掴着它的鼻子，她高声喊起来：“你怎么敢咬托托！你应当自己惭愧，像你这么大的野兽，还要去咬一只瘦弱的小狗！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Just as he spoke there came from the forest a terrible roar, and the next moment a great Lion bounded into the road. With one blow of his paw he sent the Scarecrow spinning over and over to the edge of the road, and then he struck at the Tin Woodman with his sharp claws. But, to the Lion's surprise, he could make no impression on the tin, although the Woodman fell over in the road and lay still.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="正当他说着这话时，从森林中传来一个可怕的吼声。接着，一只大狮子跳出在路当中，它用它的爪一击，把稻草人打得旋转了好几次，滚倒在路旁边。随后它用尖锐的爪子，抓着铁皮人，但是狮子不能在铁皮人身上抓出什么伤痕来，这倒使它吃了一惊，虽然铁皮人也跌出路外面，安静地躺倒了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“不过，这是不对的。百兽之王不应该是一个胆小鬼。”稻草人说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's a mystery," replied the Lion. "I suppose I was born that way. All the other animals in the forest naturally expect me to be brave, for the Lion is everywhere thought to be the King of Beasts. I learned that if I roared very loudly every living thing was frightened and got out of my way. Whenever I've met a man I've been awfully scared; but I just roared at him, and he has always run away as fast as he could go. If the elephants and the tigers and the bears had ever tried to fight me, I should have run myself -- I'm such a coward; but just as soon as they hear me roar they all try to get away from me, and of course I let them go."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这是一件神秘的事情，”狮子回答说。“我猜想我生下来就是这样的。树林中的一切野兽，都以为我是勇敢的，因为不论在什么地方，狮子被称作百兽之王。我知道如果我把声音吼得非常响，动物们都害怕了，逃开我所走的路。不论何时，我遇到一个人，就非常害怕，但我还是照样地对他吼叫，他却老是尽快逃走。如果象、老虎和熊，要想和我挑战，那我自己就逃走了——我就是这样的一个胆小鬼。但是它们在一听到我吼叫以后，一起逃开了，当然，我只有让它们逃掉。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Once, indeed, the Tin Woodman stepped upon a beetle that was crawling along the road, and killed the poor little thing. This made the Tin Woodman very unhappy, for he was always careful not to hurt any living creature; and as he walked along he wept several tears of sorrow and regret. These tears ran slowly down his face and over the hinges of his jaw, and there they rusted. When Dorothy presently asked him a question the Tin Woodman could not open his mouth, for his jaws were tightly rusted together. He became greatly frightened at this and made many motions to Dorothy to relieve him, but she could not understand. The Lion was also puzzled to know what was wrong.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是有一天，铁皮人践踏那正在沿路爬行的甲虫，踏死了这个可怜的小东西。这就使得铁皮人，真的非常不快乐，因为他常常十分小心地不去损坏任何旁的有生命的东西；因此他向前走着，掉了几点忧愁和惋借的眼泪。这些眼泪慢慢地从他的脸上淌下来，流过他的牙床的铰链，使它们发锈了。一会儿，当多萝茜问他一个问题时，这个铁皮人张不开他的嘴，因为他的上下牙床都紧紧地锈牢在一起了。他大大地惊慌，向多萝茜做着许多手势，要求救他，但是她不懂得，狮子也不知道毛病出在什么地方。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So once more the little company set off upon the journey, the Lion walking with stately strides at Dorothy's side. Toto did not approve this new comrade at first, for he could not forget how nearly he had been crushed between the Lion's great jaws. But after a time he became more at ease, and presently Toto and the Cowardly Lion had grown to be good friends.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是这个小团体又动身赶路了，狮子威严地走在多萝茜的身边。托托起初不满意这个新同伴，因为他忘不了它几乎在狮子的大牙床当中被咬得粉碎，但是过了一会儿以后，托托变得和气并且喜悦了，只和这只胆小的狮子逐渐逐渐地变成了朋友。">查看中文翻译</div>
