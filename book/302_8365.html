<div class="line_en">The family of Dashwood had long been settled in Sussex. Their estate was large, and their residence was at Norland Park, in the centre of their property, where, for many generations, they had lived in so respectable a manner as to engage the general good opinion of their surrounding acquaintance. The late owner of this estate was a single man, who lived to a very advanced age, and who for many years of his life, had a constant companion and housekeeper in his sister. But her death, which happened ten years before his own, produced a great alteration in his home; for to supply her loss, he invited and received into his house the family of his nephew Mr. Henry Dashwood, the legal inheritor of the Norland estate, and the person to whom he intended to bequeath it. In the society of his nephew and niece, and their children, the old Gentleman's days were comfortably spent. His attachment to them all increased. The constant attention of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Dashwood to his wishes, which proceeded not merely from interest, but from goodness of heart, gave him every degree of solid comfort which his age could receive; and the cheerfulness of the children added a relish to his existence.</div>

<div class="line_en">By a former marriage, Mr. Henry Dashwood had one son: by his present lady, three daughters. The son, a steady respectable young man, was amply provided for by the fortune of his mother, which had been large, and half of which devolved on him on his coming of age. By his own marriage, likewise, which happened soon afterwards, he added to his wealth. To him therefore the succession to the Norland estate was not so really important as to his sisters; for their fortune, independent of what might arise to them from their father's inheriting that property, could be but small. Their mother had nothing, and their father only seven thousand pounds in his own disposal; for the remaining moiety of his first wife's fortune was also secured to her child, and he had only a life-interest in it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="亨利。达什伍德先生同前妻生下一个儿子，同现在的太太生了三个女儿。儿子是个踏实体面的青年。当年他母亲留下一大笔遗产，到他成年时有一半交给了他，为他奠定了厚实的家底。此后不久，他成了亲，又增添了一笔财产。所以，对他说来，父亲是不是继承诺兰田庄，远不像对他几个妹妹那样至关紧要。这几个妹妹假若不依赖父亲继承这笔家业可能给她们带来的进益，她们的财产便将微乎其微。她们的母亲一无所有，父亲仅仅掌管着七千镑，而对前妻另一半遗产的所有权只在生前有效，他一去世，这一半财产也归儿子承袭。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The old gentleman died: his will was read, and like almost every other will, gave as much disappointment as pleasure. He was neither so unjust, nor so ungrateful, as to leave his estate from his nephew; -- but he left it to him on such terms as destroyed half the value of the bequest. Mr. Dashwood had wished for it more for the sake of his wife and daughters than for himself or his son; -- but to his son, and his son's son, a child of four years old, it was secured, in such a way, as to leave to himself no power of providing for those who were most dear to him, and who most needed a provision by any charge on the estate, or by any sale of its valuable woods. The whole was tied up for the benefit of this child, who, in occasional visits with his father and mother at Norland, had so far gained on the affections of his uncle, by such attractions as are by no means unusual in children of two or three years old; an imperfect articulation, an earnest desire of having his own way, many cunning tricks, and a great deal of noise, as to outweigh all the value of all the attention which, for years, he had received from his niece and her daughters. He meant not to be unkind, however, and, as a mark of his affection for the three girls, he left them a thousand pounds a-piece.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="老绅士死了，开读遗嘱，发现跟其他遗嘱一样，叫人既高兴，也失望。他并非那样偏颇无情，还是把田庄传给了侄儿。但是，因为附有条件，这份遗产便失去了一半价值。本来，达什伍德先生想要这笔财产，只是顾念妻子和女儿，而不是为自己和儿子着想。但财产却偏偏要世袭给他儿子和四岁的孙子，这样一来，他便无权动用田庄的资财，或者变卖田庄的资财，来赡养他那些最亲近、最需要赡养的家眷。为了那个孩子，全盘家业都被冻结了。想当初，这孩子只是偶尔随父母亲到诺兰庄园来过几趟，跟其他两三岁娃娃一样，也没有什么异常逗人喜爱的地方，大不过正牙牙学语，禀性倔强，好恶作剧，爱大吵大闹，却博得了老绅士的欢心。相形之下，侄媳母女多年关照的情分，倒变得无足轻重了。不过，老人也不想太苛刻，为了表示他对三个站娘的一片心意，好歹分给了每人一千镑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mr. Dashwood's disappointment was, at first, severe; but his temper was cheerful and sanguine; and he might reasonably hope to live many years, and by living economically, lay by a considerable sum from the produce of an estate already large, and capable of almost immediate improvement. But the fortune, which had been so tardy in coming, was his only one twelvemonth. He survived his uncle no longer; and ten thousand pounds, including the late legacies, was all that remained for his widow and daughters.</div>

Had he married a more amiable woman, he might have been made still more respectable than he was: -- he might even have been made amiable himself; for he was very young when he married, and very fond of his wife.

Three thousand pounds! he could spare so considerable a sum with little inconvenience." -- He thought of it all day long, and for many days successively, and he did not repent.</div>

<div class="line_en">No sooner was his father's funeral over, than Mrs. John Dashwood, without sending any notice of her intention to her mother-in-law, arrived with her child and their attendants. No one could dispute her right to come; the house was her husband's from the moment of his father's decease; but the indelicacy of her conduct was so much the greater, and to a woman in Mrs. Dashwood's situation, with only common feelings, must have been highly unpleasing; -- but in her mind there was a sense of honor so keen, a generosity so romantic, that any offence of the kind, by whomsoever given or received, was to her a source of immoveable disgust. Mrs. John Dashwood had never been a favourite with any of her husband's family; but she had had no opportunity, till the present, of shewing them with how little attention to the comfort of other people she could act when occasion required it.</div>

<div class="line_en">Elinor, this eldest daughter, whose advice was so effectual, possessed a strength of understanding, and coolness of judgment, which qualified her, though only nineteen, to be the counsellor of her mother, and enabled her frequently to counteract, to the advantage of them all, that eagerness of mind in Mrs. Dashwood which must generally have led to imprudence. She had an excellent heart; -- her disposition was affectionate, and her feelings were strong; but she knew how to govern them: it was a knowledge which her mother had yet to learn; and which one of her sisters had resolved never to be taught.</div>

<div class="line_en">Elinor saw, with concern, the excess of her sister's sensibility; but by Mrs. Dashwood it was valued and cherished. They encouraged each other now in the violence of their affliction. The agony of grief which overpowered them at first, was voluntarily renewed, was sought for, was created again and again. They gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it, and resolved against ever admitting consolation in future. Elinor, too, was deeply afflicted; but still she could struggle, she could exert herself. She could consult with her brother, could receive her sister-in-law on her arrival, and treat her with proper attention; and could strive to rouse her mother to similar exertion, and encourage her to similar forbearance.</div>
