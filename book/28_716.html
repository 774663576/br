<div class="line_en">That summer, I started keeping a journal. I bought myself a clothbound black book with purple flowers on the cover and kept it next to my bed. I took it with me when I went on business trips for Sidley &amp; Austin. I was not a daily writer, or even a weekly writer: I picked up a pen only when I had the time and energy to sort through my jumbled feelings. I'd write a few entries in a single week and then lay the journal down for a month or sometimes more. I was not, by nature, especially introspective. The whole exercise of recording one's thoughts was new to me -- a habit I'd picked up in part, I suppose, from Barack, who viewed writing as therapeutic and clarifying and had kept journals on and off over the years.</div>

<div class="line_en">He'd come back to Chicago over his summer break from Harvard, this time skipping the sublet and moving directly into my apartment on Euclid Avenue. This meant not only that we were learning, in a real way, how to cohabit as a couple but also that Barack got to know my family in a more intimate way. He'd talk sports with my dad as he headed out for a shift at the water plant. He sometimes helped my mother carry her groceries in from the garage. It was a good feeling. Craig had already assessed Barack's character in the most thorough and revealing way he could -- by including him in a high-octane weekend basketball game with a bunch of his buddies, most of them former college players. He'd done this, actually, at my request. Craig's opinion of Barack mattered to me, and my brother knew how to read people, especially in the context of a game. Barack had passed the test. He was smooth on the floor, my brother said, and knew when to make the right pass, but he also wasn't afraid to shoot when he was open. "He's no ball hog," Craig said. "But he's got guts."</div>

<div class="line_en">My boyfriend, in other words, was a big deal. He could have landed any number of fat-salaried law firm jobs at that point, but instead he was thinking about practicing civil rights law once he got his degree, even if it would then take twice as long to pay off his student loans. Practically everyone he knew was urging him to follow the lead of many previous Review editors and apply for what would be a shoo-in clerkship with the Supreme Court. But Barack wasn't interested. He wanted to live in Chicago. He had ideas for writing a book about race in America and planned, he said, to find work that aligned with his values, which most likely meant he wouldn't end up in corporate law. He steered himself with a certainty I found astounding.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="换句话说，我的男朋友是个了不起的人。那时候，他本可以在任何一家薪水丰厚的律师事务所找到工作，但他想在拿到学位之后进入民权法领域，尽管那会让他还清学生贷款的时间延长两倍。他认识的所有人几乎都劝他效仿许多之前在《哈佛法律评论》做编辑的学生，申请最高法院的书记员职位，那是稳操胜券的事。但是，贝拉克对此不感兴趣。他想在芝加哥生活。他在构思一本关于美国种族的书，还说他计划找一份与自己的价值观相符的工作，所以他很可能不会从事公司法领域的工作。他对自己的人生方向如此笃定，这让我感到吃惊。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Barack had accepted a summer-associate job with a downtown firm whose offices were close to Sidley's, but his time in Chicago was short. He'd been elected president of the Harvard Law Review for the coming academic year, which meant he'd be responsible for turning out eight issues of about three hundred pages each and would need to get back to Cambridge early in order to get started. The competition to lead the Review was ferocious every year, involving rigorous vetting and a vote by eighty student editors. Being picked for the position was an enormous achievement for anyone. It turned out that Barack was also the first African American in the publication's 103-year history to be selected -- a milestone so huge that it had been written up in the New York Times, accompanied by a photo of Barack, smiling in a scarf and winter coat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="贝拉克接受了市区另一家律师事务所的暑期实习生职位，办公室离盛德很近，不过他在芝加哥待的时间很短。他被选为《哈佛法律评论》下一学年的主席，这意味着他要负责出版八期刊物，每一期都有大约三百页的内容，所以他需要早些回剑桥市着手准备。《哈佛法律评论》主席的职位每年竞争都很激烈，要进行严格筛选，还要八十位学生编辑集体投票选举。被选中担任这一职位对任何人而言都是极大的成就。而贝拉克是这份刊物创刊一百〇三年以来首位当选的非洲裔美国人主席，这是具有里程碑意义的事件，连《纽约时报》都对此进行了报道，文章还配了一张贝拉克的照片，照片上他穿着冬衣戴着围巾在微笑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">All this inborn confidence was admirable, of course, but honestly, try living with it. For me, coexisting with Barack's strong sense of purpose -- sleeping in the same bed with it, sitting at the breakfast table with it -- was something to which I had to adjust, not because he flaunted it, exactly, but because it was so alive. In the presence of his certainty, his notion that he could make some sort of difference in the world, I couldn't help but feel a little bit lost by comparison. His sense of purpose seemed like an unwitting challenge to my own.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当然，这种天生的自信是让人钦佩的。但是说真的，你倒是跟它一起生活试试看。对我来说，和贝拉克这种强烈的使命感一起生活，在一张床上睡觉，坐在一起吃早餐，是需要适应的，不是因为贝拉克总在卖弄，而是因为你无法忽视它。在贝拉克的笃定面前，在他对自己能够在某种程度上改变世界的信念面前，我不由得有些怅然若失。他的使命感似乎一直在无意中质问我。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This little flowered book has now survived a couple of decades and multiple moves. It sat on a shelf in my dressing room at the White House for eight years, until very recently, when I pulled it out from a box in my new home to try to reacquaint myself with who I'd been as a young lawyer. I read those lines today and see exactly what I was trying to tell myself -- what a no-nonsense female mentor might have said to me directly. Really, it was simple: The first thing was that I hated being a lawyer. I wasn't suited to the work. I felt empty doing it, even if I was plenty good at it. This was a distressing thing to admit, given how hard I'd worked and how in debt I was. In my blinding drive to excel, in my need to do things perfectly, I'd missed the signs and taken the wrong road.</div>

<div class="line_en">This meant finding a new profession, and what shook me most was that I had no concrete ideas about what I wanted to do. Somehow, in all my years of schooling, I hadn't managed to think through my own passions and how they might match up with work I found meaningful. As a young person, I'd explored exactly nothing. Barack's maturity, I realized, came in part from the years he'd logged as a community organizer and even, prior to that, a decidedly unfulfilling year he'd spent as a researcher at a Manhattan business consulting firm immediately after college. He'd tried out some things, gotten to know all sorts of people, and learned his own priorities along the way. I, meanwhile, had been so afraid of floundering, so eager for respectability and a way to pay the bills, that I'd marched myself unthinkingly into the law.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那意味着我要找到一个新的职业。最让我受震动的是，我对自己想做什么没有具体的想法。在上学的那些年月，我居然没有细想过自己的热情所在，以及如何将它们与我心目中有意义的工作结合起来。年轻时，我没有做任何的探索。我意识到，贝拉克的成熟，部分原因在于他做社区组织者那些年的经历，甚至更早前，他在大学毕业后那年，在曼哈顿一家商务咨询公司做了一年的分析员，显然那是无法令人获得成就感的一年。贝拉克还尝试了其他一些工作，结识了各种各样的人，他在这个过程中认识到了自己最看重什么。相比之下，我一直害怕漫无目的的挣扎，太渴望得到别人的尊重还有挣钱支付账单，所以我没怎么认真思考就步入了法律行业。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I mused about what I might do, what skills I might possibly have. Could I be a teacher? A college administrator? Could I run some sort of after-school program, a professionalized version of what I'd done for Czerny at Princeton? I was interested in possibly working for a foundation or a nonprofit. I was interested in helping underprivileged kids. I wondered if I could find a job that engaged my mind and still left me enough time to do volunteer work, or appreciate art, or have children. I wanted a life, basically. I wanted to feel whole. I made a list of issues that interested me: education, teen pregnancy, black self-esteem. A more virtuous job, I knew, would inevitably involve a pay cut. More sobering was my next list, this one of my essential expenses -- what was left after I let go of the luxuries I'd allowed myself on a Sidley salary, things like my subscription wine service and health-club membership. I had a $600 monthly payment on my student loans, a $407 car payment, money spent on food, gas, and insurance, plus the roughly $500 a month I'd need for rent if I ever moved out of my parents' house.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the span of a year, I'd gained Barack and lost Suzanne, and the power of those two things together had left me spinning. Suzanne's sudden death had awakened me to the idea that I wanted more joy and meaning in my life. I couldn't continue to live with my own complacency. I both credited and blamed Barack for the confusion. "If there were not a man in my life constantly questioning me about what drives me and what pains me," I wrote in my journal, "would I be doing it on my own?"</div>

Sidley &amp; Austin was representing the chemical conglomerate Union Carbide in an antitrust trial involving the sale of one of its business holdings. I stayed in Washington for about three weeks but managed to see very little of the city, because my life was wholly dedicated to sitting in that room with several Sidley peers, opening file boxes that had been shipped from the company headquarters, and reviewing the thousands of pages of documents inside.</div>

My mother was a force. She had little tolerance for fools. She kept her hair short and wore practical, unfussy clothes. Everything about her radiated competence and calm. As it had been when Craig and I were kids, she didn't get involved with our private lives. Her love came in the form of reliability. She showed up when your flight came in.

<div class="line_en">At home on Euclid Avenue, I felt powerless in the face of a new reality. My father's feet had started to swell for no obvious reason. His skin looked strangely mottled and dark. Anytime I asked how he was feeling, though, he gave me the same answer, with the same degree of insistence that he'd given me for years.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="而在欧几里得大道的家中，一个新的情况让我感觉无能为力。我父亲的脚开始不明原因地肿胀，他的皮肤也很奇怪地出现斑点并变暗。但每次我问他感觉如何时，他都给我同一个答案，并且带着多年来一以贯之的肯定。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was winter again in Chicago. I woke in the mornings to the sound of the neighbors chipping ice from their windshields on the street. The wind blew and the snow piled up. The sun stayed wan and weak. Through my office window on the forty-seventh floor at Sidley, I looked out at a tundra of gray ice on Lake Michigan and a gunmetal sky above. I wore my wool and hoped for a thaw. In the Midwest, as I've mentioned, winter is an exercise in waiting -- for relief, for a bird to sing, for the first purple crocus to push up through the snow. You have no choice in the meantime but to pep-talk yourself through.</div>

<div class="line_en">My dad hadn't lost his jovial good humor. Craig came by for family dinners once in a while, and we sat around the table and laughed the same as always, though we were now joined by Janis, Craig's wife. Janis was happy and hard-driving, a telecommunications analyst who worked downtown and was, like everyone else, completely smitten with my dad. Craig, meanwhile, was a poster child for the post-Princeton urban-professional dream. He was getting an MBA and had a job as a vice president at Continental Bank, and he and Janis had bought a nice condo in Hyde Park. He wore tailored suits and had driven over for dinner in his red Porsche 944 Turbo. I didn't know it then, but none of this made him happy. Like me, he had his own crisis brewing and in coming years would wrestle with questions about whether his work was meaningful, whether the rewards he'd felt compelled to seek were the rewards he actually wanted. Knowing, though, how thrilled our father was by what his kids had managed to accomplish, neither of us ever brought up our discontent over dinner.</div>

<div class="line_en">The stalemate over a doctor's visit continued through January and into February that year. My dad moved with a pained slowness, using an aluminum walker to get himself around the house, pausing often to catch his breath. It took longer in the mornings now for him to maneuver from bed to bathroom, bathroom to kitchen, and finally to the back door and down the three stairs to the garage so that he could drive himself to work. Despite what was happening at home, he insisted that all was well at the filtration plant. He used a motorized scooter to pilot himself from boiler to boiler and took pride in his own indispensability. In twenty-six years, he hadn't missed a single shift. If a boiler happened to overheat, my dad claimed to be one of only a few workers with enough experience to swiftly and ably contain a disaster. In a true reflection of his optimism, he'd recently put his name in for a promotion.</div>

<div class="line_en">What did Barack and I want? We wanted a modern partnership that suited us both. He saw marriage as the loving alignment of two people who could lead parallel lives but without forgoing any independent dreams or ambitions. For me, marriage was more like a full-on merger, a reconfiguring of two lives into one, with the well-being of a family taking precedence over any one agenda or goal. I didn't exactly want a life like my parents had. I didn't want to live in the same house forever, work the same job, and never claim any space for myself, but I did want the year-to-year, decade-to-decade steadiness they had.

Remember the boxing gloves you gave us, and the swimming pool at Dukes Happy Holiday Resort? What about how you used to build the props for Robbie's Operetta Workshop? What about dinners at Dandy's house? Remember when Mom made us fried shrimp on New Year's Eve?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们轮流到医院陪护他—母亲、克雷格、珍妮丝和我。我们来来去去，看着医生给他开一堆药，看着他身上插了管子，仪器也架上了。我们试图搞清楚专家跟我们讲的话，但真的听不太懂。我们整理父亲的枕头，徒劳地跟他谈大学的篮球赛和外面的天气，我们知道他在听，虽然他已经没有力气说话。我们一家人习惯做计划，但当时所有事情都无法计划。渐渐地，我的父亲在离我们远去，被某个无形的海洋裹挟而去。我们努力用旧日的记忆把他召唤回来，那些记忆让他的眼睛里有了一点儿亮光。还记得“两块两毛五”吗，还记得我们夏天常常坐在它宽大的后座上到汽车电影院去吗？还记得你给我们的拳击手套吗，还有杜克斯快乐假日的游泳池？还有你以前怎么给萝比的轻歌剧学习班做道具？还记得我们在祖父家的聚餐吗？还记得母亲在新年前夜给我们做的煎大虾吗？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">One evening I stopped by and found my father alone, my mother having gone home for the night, the nurses clustered outside at their hallway station. The room was quiet. The whole floor of the hospital was quiet. It was the first week of March, the winter snow having just melted, leaving the city in what felt like a perpetual state of dampness. My dad had been in the hospital about ten days then. He was fifty-five years old, but he looked like an old man, with yellowed eyes and arms too heavy to move. He was awake but unable to speak, whether due to the swelling or due to emotion, I'll never know.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="晚上，我顺路到医院去，发现只有父亲一个人，母亲已经回家休息了，护士们都在外面走廊里的护士站。房间里很安静。医院的那一个楼层都很安静。那是3月的第一周，冬雪刚刚开始融化，城市里到处都一片潮湿，感觉永远干不了似的。父亲在医院里已经待了十天了。五十五岁的他看起来像一个老头儿，眼珠儿泛黄，胳膊沉重得无法移动。他醒着，但是不能说话，是因为那个肿块，还是因为情绪，我永远无法知道了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I sat in a chair next to his bed and watched him laboring to breathe. When I put my hand in his, he gave it a comforting squeeze. We looked at each other silently. There was too much to say, and at the same time it felt as if we'd said everything. What was left was only one truth. We were reaching the end. He would not recover. He was going to miss the whole rest of my life. I was losing his steadiness, his comfort, his everyday joy. I felt tears spilling down my cheeks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我坐在他床边的椅子上，看着他艰难地呼吸着。我把手放在他的手上，他安慰地握了一下我的手。我们相对无言地看着彼此。有太多的话要说，但同时感觉该说的话都说了。我们面前只有一个真相：我们在一起的日子就要结束了。他的身体不会康复，他会错过我余生的全部日子。我会失去他给我的安稳、抚慰还有每天的快乐。泪水开始顺着我的脸颊止不住地流淌。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I stayed with him until he fell asleep that night, leaving the hospital in icy darkness and driving back home to Euclid Avenue, where my mother had already turned off the lights. We were alone in the house now, just me and my mom and whatever future we were now meant to have. Because by the time the sun came up, he'd be gone. My father -- Fraser Robinson III -- had a heart attack and passed away that night, having given us absolutely everything.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天晚上，我一直陪着他，直到他睡着我才离开医院，走进冰冷的黑夜中，开车回到欧几里得大道的家，那时母亲已经关灯了。就我们俩在那栋房子里，我和母亲，还有我们即将迎来的未来。因为当第二天的太阳升起，他就要离开了。我的父亲—弗雷泽·罗宾逊三世，那天晚上突发心脏病离开了人世，他把一生所有的一切都给了我们。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Keeping his gaze on me, my father lifted the back of my hand to his lips and kissed it again and again and again. It was his way of saying, Hush now, don't cry. He was expressing sorrow and urgency, but also something calmer and deeper, a message he wanted to make clear. With those kisses, he was saying that he loved me with his whole heart, that he was proud of the woman I'd become. He was saying that he knew he should have gone to the doctor a lot sooner. He was asking for forgiveness. He was saying good-bye.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="父亲凝望着我，让我把我的手背放在他的唇边，亲了又亲，亲了又亲。我知道他是在说：“嘘，不要哭。”他在表达悲伤和急切，还有某种更平静更深沉的情感，那是他想要清晰传达的信息。他用这些吻在告诉我，他全心全意地爱着我，他为现在的我感到骄傲。他在告诉我，他知道他应该早点来看医生。他在请求我原谅他。他在向我告别。">查看中文翻译</div>
