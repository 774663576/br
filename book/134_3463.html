<div class="line_en">Therese went into her old room, and the first thing she noticed was that the carpet corner lay flat. And how small and tragic the room looked. And yet hers, the tiny radio on the bookshelf, and the pillows on the studio couch, as personal as a signature she had written long ago and forgotten.</div>

<div class="line_en">That same afternoon, she made an appointment with Ned Bernstein, the co-producer of the English show for which Harkevy was to do the sets. She took three of the models she had made in the West and also the Small Rain photographs to show him. An apprentice job with Harkevy, if she got it, wouldn't pay enough to live on, but there were other sources, other than department stores, anyway. There was television, for instance.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mr. Bernstein looked at her work indifferently. Therese said she hadn't spoken to Mr. Harkevy yet, and asked Mr. Bernstein if he knew anything about his taking on helpers. Mr. Bernstein said that was up to Harkevy, but as far as he knew, he didn't need any more assistants. Neither did Mr. Bernstein know of any other set studio that needed anyone at the moment. And Therese thought of the sixty-dollar dress. And of the hundred dollars left in the bank. And she had told Mrs. Osborne she might show the apartment any time she wished, because she was moving. Therese hadn't yet any idea where. She got up to leave, and thanked Mr. Bernstein anyway for looking at her work. She did it with a smile.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="柏恩斯坦先生冷淡地看着她的作品，特芮丝说她还没有和哈凯维先生谈过，还问柏恩斯坦先生知不知道哈凯维想要招收助手的事情。柏恩斯坦先生回答，那恐怕要由哈凯维自己决定，但据他所知，哈凯维现在不需要助理。柏恩斯坦先生也不知道还有哪个剧场场景工作室现在需要增雇人手。特芮丝想到那件售价六十元的衣服，还有存在银行的一百元。她已经告诉奥斯朋太太说她要搬家，所以她随时可以让别人进来看公寓。不过特芮丝还不知道自己接下来要搬到哪里。她起身准备离开，微笑着向柏恩斯坦先生道谢，谢谢他看了她的作品。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Therese went to the door of the drugstore and stood there for a few moments, looking out at the Camel advertisement with the giant face puffing smoke rings like gigantic doughnuts, at the low-slung, sullen-looking taxis maneuvering like sharks in the after-matinee rush, at the familiar hodgepodge of restaurant and bar signs, awnings, front steps and windows, that reddish-brown confusion of the side street that was like hundreds of streets in New York. She remembered walking in a certain street in the West Eighties once, the brownstone fronts, overlaid and overlaid with humanity, human lives, some beginning and some ending there, and she remembered the sense of oppression it had given her, and how she had hurried through it to get to the avenue. Only two or three months ago. Now the same kind of street filled her with a tense excitement, made her want to plunge headlong into it, down the sidewalk with all the signs and theater marquees and rushing, bumping people. She turned and walked back to the telephone booths.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特芮丝回到店门口站了几分钟，往外看着骆驼牌香烟的广告，广告面板上出现了一张巨大的脸，吐出如巨型甜甜圈般的烟圈。她望着低矮灰暗、外表了无生气的计程车，像鲨鱼般在午后的车流中穿梭，又看着熟悉的餐厅及酒吧招牌、遮雨棚、阶梯和鳞次栉比伫立的窗户，望着红褐色调的小巷道里面那种混乱的场面，就像纽约数以百计的其他街道一样。她想起自己曾在西八十街某条小巷道上散步，步道是红褐色砂石铺面的，是用一层一层的人性、人生、起始、结束所铺上去的。她也记得这条街带给她的压迫感，还有她怎么匆忙跑穿过那条街，直抵外面的大道。这只不过是两三个月前的事；而现在，同样的街道也为她注入一种紧张的兴奋感，让她想要一头栽进去，走进有招牌和戏院遮雨棚的街道，走进行色匆匆、彼此互撞的人群中。她转身走回电话亭。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Carol was a quarter of an hour late. Therese sat waiting for her at a table where she could see the glass doors that led into the bar, and finally she saw Carol push open one of the doors, and the tension broke in her with a small dull ache. Carol wore the same fur coat, the same black suede pumps she had worn the day Therese first saw her, but now a red scarf set off the blond lifted head. She saw Carol's face, thinner now, alter with surprise, with a little smile, as Carol caught sight of her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡罗尔迟到了十五分钟。特芮丝坐在可以看到玻璃门的桌边等待，玻璃门通往酒吧。她终于看到卡罗尔打开门，她因为紧张而出现一阵小小的闷痛。卡罗尔的穿着和两人初次相遇的那天一模一样：同样的毛皮外套，同样的黑色皮质高跟女鞋，只是多了一条红色的围巾，衬托着她金黄色的头发。卡罗尔的脸瘦下来了，一见到特芮丝就稍微变了一下脸色，带着惊讶和一点微笑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I didn't even know you at first." And Carol stood by the table a moment, looking at her, before she sat down. "It's nice of you to see me."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“不会。”特芮丝闻到卡罗尔淡淡的香水味，这股熟悉又甜美的味道现在却变得很奇怪，很陌生，这个味道并没有激起以前它曾带来的热情。她把手中的火柴盒放下。“卡罗尔，我怎么能恨你呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Carol's phrase "come out" had made her think of being born, and it embarrassed her. Yes, she had been born since she left Carol.

It would be a world as unknown as the world just past had been when she first entered it. Only now, there were no obstacles. Therese thought of Carol's perfume that today meant nothing.

She was gambling now as she had gambled on getting everything from the detective that day on the road, and she lost then, too.

Then as she saw Carol touch the handle of the car door, she remembered the beer can still under the front seat, remembered its clink as she had driven up the ramp from the Lincoln Tunnel coming into New York.

<div class="line_en">Therese set her drink down on the edge of a table, and reached for a cigarette in her handbag. It was done. She glanced at the door. A woman with upswept blond hair, with bright, intense blue eyes had just come into the room and was causing a small furor of excitement around her. She had quick, positive movements as she turned to greet people, to shake hands, and suddenly Therese realized she was Genevieve Cranell, the English actress who was to play the lead. She looked different from the few stills Therese had seen of her. She had the kind of face that must be seen in action to be attractive.</div>

Therese felt an exciting attraction in the neat back of her head, in the funny, careless lift of her nose at the end, the only careless feature of her narrow, classic face. Her lips were rather thin. She looked extremely alert, and imperturbably poised. Yet Therese sensed that Genevieve Cranell might not talk to her again at the party for the simple reason that she probably wanted to.</div>

Therese smiled to herself. The air was cool and sweet on her forehead, made a feathery sound like wings past her ears, and she felt she flew across the streets and up the curbs. Toward Carol.

Carol raised her hand slowly and brushed her hair back, once on either side, and Therese smiled because the gesture was Carol, and it was Carol she loved and would always love. Oh, in a different way now, because she was a different person, and it was like meeting Carol all over again, but it was still Carol and no one else. It would be Carol, in a thousand cities, a thousand houses, in foreign lands where they would go together, in heaven and in hell. Therese waited.
