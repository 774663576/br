<div class="line_en">I cannot blame them, Catelyn thought. They do not know And if they did, why should they care? They never knew my sons. Never watched Bran climb with their hearts in their throats, pride and terror so mingled they seemed as one, never heard him laugh, never smiled to see Rickon trying so fiercely to be like his older brothers. She stared at the supper set before her: trout wrapped in bacon, salad of turnip greens and red fennel and sweetgrass, pease and onions and hot bread. Brienne was eating methodically, as if supper were another chore to be accomplished. I am become a sour woman, Catelyn thought. I take no joy in mead nor meat, and song and laughter have become suspicious strangers to me. I am a creature of grief and dust and bitter longings. There is an empty place within me where my heart was once.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Great Hall of Riverrun was a lonely place for two to sit to supper. Deep shadows draped the walls. One of the torches had guttered out, leaving only three. Catelyn sat staring into her wine goblet. The vintage tasted thin and sour on her tongue. Brienne was across from her. Between them, her father's high seat was as empty as the rest of the hall. Even the servants were gone. She had given them leave to join the celebration.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="奔流城的大厅对两个孤苦晚餐的人而言，显得非常空寂。长影洒在墙上。一支火把悄无声息地熄灭，只余三支残留。凯特琳默默地坐着，瞪向面前的酒杯，唇边美酒无味而酸楚。布蕾妮坐在对面，两人之间，父亲的高位同厅堂里其他座位一般空旷无人。连仆人们也都离开，她准许他们去参加庆祝。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The walls of the keep were thick, yet even so, they could hear the muffled sounds of revelry from the yard outside. Ser Desmond had brought twenty casks up from the cellars, and the smallfolk were celebrating Edmure's imminent return and Robb's conquest of the Crag by hoisting horns of nut-brown ale.</div>

<div class="line_en">Such a simple question that was; would that the answer could be as simple. When Catelyn tried to speak, the words caught in her throat. "I have no sons but Robb." She managed those terrible words without a sob, and for that much she was glad.</div>

<div class="line_en">Brienne's face was a watery blur. She reached across the table, but her fingers stopped short of Catelyn's, as if the touch might be unwelcome. "I… there are no words, my lady. My good lady. Your sons, they… they're with the gods now."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="泪眼望去，布蕾妮的面孔一片模糊。只见她从桌子对面伸出手，但指头始终没有碰到凯特琳，似乎犹豫如此的触碰不受欢迎，“我…不知该怎么说，夫人。我的好夫人。您的儿子们，他们…他们现在与诸神同在。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Are they?" Catelyn said sharply. "What god would let this happen? Rickon was only a baby. How could he deserve such a death? And Bran… when I left the north, he had not opened his eyes since his fall. I had to go before he woke. Now I can never return to him, or hear him laugh again." She showed Brienne her palms, her fingers. "These scars… they sent a man to cut Bran's throat as he lay sleeping. He would have died then, and me with him, but Bran's wolf tore out the man's throat." That gave her a moment's pause. "I suppose Theon killed the wolves too. He must have, elsewise… I was certain the boys would be safe so long as the direwolves were with them. Like Robb with his Grey Wind. But my daughters have no wolves now."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是吗？”凯特琳尖刻地说，“什么样的神灵允许这种事发生？瑞肯还是个小婴孩，为何就难逃一死？而布兰…当我离开北境时，他自坠楼后还没睁开过眼睛。我在他醒来之前离去，如今再也不能回到他身边，再也听不到他的欢笑。”她张开手掌，让布蕾妮看看她的手指。“这些伤疤…布兰昏迷不醒时，他们派来杀手，想乘机割他喉咙。布兰差点就没了命，我也会和他一起死，幸亏他的狼撕开来人的喉咙，救了他一命。”她顿了一会儿。“想必席恩连狼也杀了，一定是的，否则…我知道只要那些狼一息尚存，我的儿子就很安全，正如灰风之于罗柏…可我的女儿们都没有狼了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Sansa was a lady at three, always so courteous and eager to please. She loved nothing so well as tales of knightly valor. Men would say she had my look, but she will grow into a woman far more beautiful than I ever was, you can see that. I often sent away her maid so I could brush her hair myself. She had auburn hair, lighter than mine, and so thick and soft… the red in it would catch the light of the torches and shine like copper.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Send my daughters back unharmed?" Catelyn smiled sadly. "There is a sweet innocence about you, child. I could wish… but no. Robb will avenge his brothers. Ice can kill as dead as fire. Ice was Ned's greatsword. Valyrian steel, marked with the ripples of a thousand foldings, so sharp I feared to touch it. Robb's blade is dull as a cudgel compared to Ice. It will not be easy for him to get Theon's head off, I fear. The Starks do not use headsmen. Ned always said that the man who passes the sentence should swing the blade, though he never took any joy in the duty. But I would, oh, yes." She stared at her scarred hands, opened and closed them, then slowly raised her eyes. "I've sent him wine."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“把我的女儿平平安安送回来？”凯特琳哀伤地笑了。“这只是你甜美单纯的想法啊，我的孩子。我也这么希望…但那不会发生。如今只能靠罗柏去为他的弟弟们报仇，但愿寒冰也像烈火一般致命。你知道吗？从前奈德的配剑就叫寒冰，那是瓦雷利亚钢剑，其上有千道螺旋的波纹，锋利得让我不敢触碰。罗柏的剑与寒冰相比就如棍棒似的，恐怕要他去砍葛雷乔伊的头不太容易。史塔克冢是没有刽子手的，奈德常说，判人死刑者必须亲自动手，杀戮是他的责任，但他从未从中获得喜乐。但我会的，噢，我会的！”她看着手上的刀疤，五指开开阖阖，最后缓缓抬眼。“我给他也送了壶葡萄酒。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"And Arya, well… Ned's visitors would oft mistake her for a stableboy if they rode into the yard unannounced. Arya was a trial, it must be said. Half a boy and half a wolf pup. Forbid her anything and it became her heart's desire. She had Ned's long face, and brown hair that always looked as though a bird had been nesting in it. I despaired of ever making a lady of her. She collected scabs as other girls collect dolls, and would say anything that came into her head. I think she must be dead too." When she said that, it felt as though a giant hand were squeezing her chest. "I want them all dead, Brienne. Theon Greyjoy first, then Jaime Lannister and Cersei and the Imp, every one, every one. But my girls… my girls will…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“而艾莉亚呢，呵呵…奈德的客人们若未经通报径自骑进中庭，总把她当成马房小弟。不得不承认，艾莉亚是个棘手的孩子，一半是男孩，一半是小狼。你越不准她做什么，她就越是想到了心坎里。她继承了奈德的长脸，一头褐发乱得跟鸟窝似的。我费尽心机想让她成为淑女，却一事无成。别的女孩收集玩偶娃娃，她收集的却是一身伤疤，说话又总不经思考，冲口而出。我想她已经死了。”这话贸然出口，好似巨人在挤压她的胸膛。“布蕾妮，我希望他们统统死去。首先是席恩·葛雷乔伊，接着是詹姆·兰尼斯特、瑟曦和小恶魔，每个人…每个人都死去，一个不留。而我的女儿，我的女儿…”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"The dungeons are windowless. One hour is much like another down there, and for me, all hours are midnight." Her footsteps rang hollowly when Catelyn left the hall. As she climbed to Lord Hoster's solar, she could hear them outside, shouting, "Tully!" and "A cup! A cup to the brave young lord!" My father is not dead, she wanted to shout down at them.

One hand hung over the edge of the mattress, a pale frail fleshless thing, but warm when she touched it. She slid her fingers through his and closed them.

<div class="line_en">"I have no one to talk with, Father," she told him. "I pray, but the gods do not answer." Lightly she kissed his hand. The skin was warm, blue veins branching like rivers beneath his pale translucent skin. Outside the greater rivers flowed, the Red Fork and the Tumblestone, and they would flow forever, but not so the rivers in her father's hand. Too soon that current would grow still. "Last night I dreamed of that time Lysa and I got lost while riding back from Seagard. Do you remember? That strange fog came up and we fell behind the rest of the party. Everything was grey, and I could not see a foot past the nose of my horse. We lost the road. The branches of the trees were like long skinny arms reaching out to grab us as we passed.

<div class="line_en">After a time the candle guttered and went out. Moonlight slanted between the slats of the shutters, laying pale silvery bars across her father's face. She could hear the soft whisper of his labored breathing, the endless rush of waters, the faint chords of some love song drifting up from the yard, so sad and sweet. "I loved a maid as red as autumn," Rymund sang, "with sunset in her hair."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="良久之后，蜡烛闪烁，终归熄灭。月光从窄窗间的缝隙流泻而进，在父亲脸上留下斑驳的银色花斑。她听着他吃力地呼吸所发出的轻弱低语，听着永无休止的湍激波涛，听着院里飘来竖琴弹奏的微弱的情爱歌谣，伤感而又甜蜜。“我爱上一位艳如秋阳的佳人，”雷蒙德唱道，“落霞洒在她的发梢…”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I keep remembering the Stark words. Winter has come, Father. For me. For me. Robb must fight the Greyjoys now as well as the Lannisters, and for what? For a gold hat and an iron chair? Surely the land has bled enough. I want my girls back, I want Robb to lay down his sword and pick some homely daughter of Walder Frey to make him happy and give him sons. I want Bran and Rickon back, I want…" Catelyn hung her head.

The walls were discolored with patches of nitre. Through the stone, she could hear the faint rush of the Tumblestone.

Jaime Lannister had been allowed no razor since the night he was taken in the Whispering Wood, and a shaggy beard covered his face, once so like the queen's. Glinting gold in the lamplight, the whiskers made him look like some great yellow beast, magnificent even in chains.
