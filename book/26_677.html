<div class="line_en">No hour of my stay in fact was so assailed with apprehensions as that of my coming down to learn that the carriage containing Mrs. Grose and my younger pupil had already rolled out of the gates.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a tighter place still than I had yet turned round in; all the more that, for the first time, I could see in the aspect of others a confused reflection of the crisis.</div>

<div class="line_en">What had happened naturally caused them all to stare; there was too little of the explained, throw out whatever we might, in the suddenness of my colleague's act. The maids and the men looked blank; the effect of which on my nerves was an aggravation until I saw the necessity of making it a positive aid.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所发生的一切自然让他们目瞪口呆，关于我的同事为何匆匆离去，除了可以说的，我没给他们太多解释。女仆们和男仆们看上去满脸茫然，这让我紧张地认为事情在恶化，直到我发现有必要将此不利条件转化为对我有利的帮助。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now I WAS, I said to myself, face to face with the elements, and for much of the rest of the day, while I fought my weakness, I could consider that I had been supremely rash.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我对自己说，现在我跟这些事情面对面，而在这一天剩下的大部分时间里，我在跟自己的缺点作斗争，我认为自己鲁莽至极。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Yet it was when she had got off -- and I missed her on the spot -- that the great pinch really came. If I had counted on what it would give me to find myself alone with Miles, I speedily perceived, at least, that it would give me a measure.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，就在她离开之后——我立马就想念她了——紧要关头真的来了。如果我期望与迈尔斯的独处能给我什么收获，我很快认识到，至少它会给我一个办法。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So, for the benefit of whom it might concern, I paraded with a sick heart.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所以，为了可能相关的人的利益，我怀着一颗不安的心行进着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The person it appeared least to concern proved to be, till dinner, little Miles himself. My perambulations had given me, meanwhile, no glimpse of him, but they had tended to make more public the change taking place in our relation as a consequence of his having at the piano, the day before, kept me, in Flora's interest, so beguiled and befooled.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="直到正餐时我才发现，最不关心此事的人，正是小迈尔斯他本人。我在巡视期间没有见过他一眼，但这次巡视让我们之间关系的变化更加公开，这种变化发生于前一天，是他为了弗洛拉，在钢琴边欺骗和愚弄我的结果。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I welcomed the consciousness that I was charged with much to do, and I caused it to be known as well that, left thus to myself, I was quite remarkably firm. I wandered with that manner, for the next hour or two, all over the place and looked, I have no doubt, as if I were ready for any onset.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我感觉到我要承担很多事情，我也让他们知道，这些事情都留给我掌管，对此我尤为坚定。在接下来的一两个小时里，我带着那种态度四处走动查看，毫无疑问，我就像是已经准备好应付任何袭击了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was precisely, in short, by just clutching the helm that I avoided total wreck; and I dare say that, to bear up at all, I became, that morning, very grand and very dry.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="简而言之，很明显，只有掌好舵才能避免船毁人亡。而我敢说，为了支撑全局，那天上午我变得非常庄重，枯燥乏味。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The stamp of publicity had of course been fully given by her confinement and departure, and the change itself was now ushered in by our nonobservance of the regular custom of the schoolroom. He had already disappeared when, on my way down, I pushed open his door, and I learned below that he had breakfasted -- in the presence of a couple of the maids -- with Mrs. Grose and his sister. He had then gone out, as he said, for a stroll; than which nothing, I reflected, could better have expressed his frank view of the abrupt transformation of my office.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这种公开的标志当然是弗洛拉被关了禁闭又被送走，而现在无视教室惯例更加推进了这种变化。当我下来推开他的门时，他已不在那里了。然后我得知他正和格罗斯太太还有他的妹妹吃早饭——当着几个女仆的面。他说想散散步，然后就出去了。我认为，没有什么能比这一举动更能表现出他对我职责突然变换的坦率态度了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">What he would not permit this office to consist of was yet to be settled: there was a queer relief, at all events -- I mean for myself in especial -- in the renouncement of one pretension.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在我的职责范围中，什么是他不允许的，这还有待确定。无论如何，放弃一种要求，使我感到异样的轻松，尤其是对于我自己来说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">If so much had sprung to the surface, I scarce put it too strongly in saying that what had perhaps sprung highest was the absurdity of our prolonging the fiction that I had anything more to teach him. It sufficiently stuck out that, by tacit little tricks in which even more than myself he carried out the care for my dignity, I had had to appeal to him to let me off straining to meet him on the ground of his true capacity. He had at any rate his freedom now; I was never to touch it again; as I had amply shown, moreover, when, on his joining me in the schoolroom the previous night, I had uttered, on the subject of the interval just concluded, neither challenge nor hint.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="即便这么多事实已经浮出表面，我几乎不能特别坚定地说浮在最顶端的事物却是荒诞无稽，我们继续伪装着我还有更多的东西要教他。他用一些心照不宣的小把戏，甚至比我自己更全面地照顾了我的尊严，这让我忍不住请求他把我从他那些应变中放下来，去面对有真实的他。无论如何，他现在拥有他的自由了，我再也不会干涉他的自由。而且，就像前一天晚上他陪我呆在教室时我所充分表现出来的一样，对于前段时间刚刚结束的那个问题，我从没有说过任何质疑或暗示的话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I had too much, from this moment, my other ideas.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从这一刻起，我有了太多其他的想法。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Yet when he at last arrived, the difficulty of applying them, the accumulations of my problem, were brought straight home to me by the beautiful little presence on which what had occurred had as yet, for the eye, dropped neither stain nor shadow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，当他最后到来的时候，应用它们的困难、我累积的问题马上被这个漂亮的小出场者带回来，带到我的面前，看上去到现在为止，所发生的一切从未在他身上留下任何印记或阴影。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">To mark, for the house, the high state I cultivated I decreed that my meals with the boy should be served, as we called it, downstairs; so that I had been awaiting him in the ponderous pomp of the room outside of the window of which I had had from Mrs. Grose, that first scared Sunday, my flash of something it would scarce have done to call light.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="为了向房子里的人表明我所建立起来的威严，我命令仆人，应该侍奉我和迈尔斯在我们所谓的楼下用餐。然后我就一直在沉闷而浮华的房间里等他，就在这个房间的窗外，在令人担忧的第一个星期天，我从格罗斯太太那里隐约感觉到灵光一现，有什么事情，但还不是很清楚。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I could only get on at all by taking "nature" into my confidence and my account, by treating my monstrous ordeal as a push in a direction unusual, of course, and unpleasant, but demanding, after all, for a fair front, only another turn of the screw of ordinary human virtue.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我只能靠把“自然的力量”放到我的自信和理由中才能继续前行，把我巨大的折磨当作一种推动力——当然这是朝向一个异乎寻常、并不愉快、但亟待解决的方向，毕竟，为了美好的前方，只有靠普通人将螺丝再拧紧一下。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">No attempt, nonetheless, could well require more tact than just this attempt to supply, one's self, ALL the nature.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，没有哪一次尝试比这一次需要更多的机智，以使一个人感觉完全自然。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">How could I put even a little of that article into a suppression of reference to what had occurred? How, on the other hand, could I make reference without a new plunge into the hideous obscure? Well, a sort of answer, after a time, had come to me, and it was so far confirmed as that I was met, incontestably, by the quickened vision of what was rare in my little companion.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我怎能用这么少的文字描述出所发生的一切引起的压抑感呢？另一方面，既然没有关于这件令人惊骇的、费解的事情的新发现，我能怎么作出注解？然而，一段时间过后，答案向我走来了，而且这个答案目前已经被证实了：不可否认，我很快看到了迈尔斯的反常举止。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Here at present I felt afresh -- for I had felt it again and again -- how my equilibrium depended on the success of my rigid will, the will to shut my eyes as tight as possible to the truth that what I had to deal with was, revoltingly, against nature.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此时此地我再次感觉到——因为我已经一次又一次地感觉到——我的心理平衡依赖于我那坚定意志的胜利，它使我对不得不应对的事实尽量紧闭双眼，我所处理的事情是违背自然的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The roast mutton was on the table, and I had dispensed with attendance. Miles, before he sat down, stood a moment with his hands in his pockets and looked at the joint, on which he seemed on the point of passing some humorous judgment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="桌子上摆着烤羊肉，我已经按照就餐人数分好了。迈尔斯在坐下之前先站了一会儿，他的两手放在口袋里，他看着羊肉关节处，好像即将对此作出一番幽默的评价。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But what he presently produced was: "I say, my dear, is she really very awfully ill?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但不一会儿他说道：“我说，我亲爱的，她真的病得很严重吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Wasn't there light in the fact which, as we shared our solitude, broke out with a specious glitter it had never yet quite worn? -- The fact that (opportunity aiding, precious opportunity which had now come) it would be preposterous, with a child so endowed, to forego the help one might wrest from absolute intelligence? What had his intelligence been given him for but to save him? Mightn't one, to reach his mind, risk the stretch of an angular arm over his character? It was as if, when we were face to face in the dining room, he had literally shown me the way.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当我们分享我们的孤独时，真相之光难道就没有带着华而不实的闪烁迸发出从未有过亮光？——真相就是（靠着机会的帮助，珍贵的机会现在已经来了），一个如此有天赋的孩子，放弃他努力从绝对的智慧中寻求到的帮助，是否很可笑？他的智慧除了能拯救他还能为他带来什么？一个人难道不会为了达到他的想法，而想到冒险地超出他的性格而伸开一条瘦削的手臂吗？当我们在餐厅面对面时，他好像已经完全给我展示了他的方法。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Little Flora? Not so bad but that she'll presently be better. London will set her up. Bly had ceased to agree with her. Come here and take your mutton." He alertly obeyed me, carried the plate carefully to his seat, and, when he was established, went on. "Did Bly disagree with her so terribly suddenly?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“小弗洛拉吗？不是那么严重，她很快就会好一些了。伦敦会让她好起来的。布莱已经不再适合她了。过来吧，吃你的羊肉。”他很机灵地听了我的话，拿着盘子小心翼翼地来到他的座位，坐好后，他继续问道：“布莱如此突然地就不适合她了？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was indeed as if he had found even now -- as he had so often found at lessons -- still some other delicate way to ease me off.</div>

<div class="line_en">Whatever he had been driven from school for, it was not for ugly feeding. He was irreproachable, as always, today; but he was unmistakably more conscious. He was discernibly trying to take for granted more things than he found, without assistance, quite easy; and he dropped into peaceful silence while he felt his situation.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无论是出于什么原因他被学校开除，那绝对不会是因为难看的吃相。就像往常一样，他今天无可指责，但很明显他更谨慎了。显而易见，他本来理所当然地认为他未发现的事很简单，不需要别人帮忙，而当他得知自己的处境时，他就陷入到安宁的沉默中。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Then why didn't you get her off before?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那你为什么不之前把她送走？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I found myself prompt. "She's NOT too ill to travel: she only might have become so if she had stayed. This was just the moment to seize. The journey will dissipate the influence"-- oh, I was grand!--"and carry it off."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我立即回答道：“她没有病得不能旅行，她如果留下来，才有可能会那样。现在正是抓住时机的时刻。旅行将驱散这个影响，”——哦，我太棒了——“并且把它带走。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I see, I see"-- Miles, for that matter, was grand, too. He settled to his repast with the charming little "table manner" that, from the day of his arrival, had relieved me of all grossness of admonition.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我明白了，我明白了。”迈尔斯在那件事情上也很棒。他用那可爱的小小的“餐桌礼仪”用餐，从他到来的那天起，这种礼仪就让我丧失了所有关于粗野的警惕性。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well -- so we're alone!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好了，就剩咱俩了！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Our meal was of the briefest -- mine a vain pretense, and I had the things immediately removed. While this was done Miles stood again with his hands in his little pockets and his back to me -- stood and looked out of the wide window through which, that other day, I had seen what pulled me up. We continued silent while the maid was with us -- as silent, it whimsically occurred to me, as some young couple who, on their wedding journey, at the inn, feel shy in the presence of the waiter. He turned round only when the waiter had left us.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们这一次用餐是最快的一次——我好像在做样子，很快就将东西移到一边了。这一切都做完后，迈尔斯再次站了起来，他的两只手放在小口袋里，背对着我站在那里向窗外看，那天我就是透过这扇大窗子看到了让我止步的事情。当女仆跟我们一起时，我们继续保持沉默——我突发奇想，这种沉默就跟一对年轻的夫妇在新婚旅行途中的旅馆里，在侍者面前感到害羞时表现出的沉默一样。侍者刚一离开，他就转过了身。">查看中文翻译</div>
