<div class="line_en">It was Jem's turn to cry. His face was streaked with angry tears as we made our way through the cheerful crowd. "It ain't right," he muttered, all the way to the corner of the square where we found Atticus waiting. Atticus was standing under the street light looking as though nothing had happened: his vest was buttoned, his collar and tie were neatly in place, his watch-chain glistened, he was his impassive self again.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“他怎么了？”姑妈指着杰姆问道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Aunt Alexandra was waiting up. She was in her dressing gown, and I could have sworn she had on her corset underneath it. "I'm sorry, brother," she murmured. Having never heard her call Atticus "brother" before, I stole a glance at Jem, but he was not listening. He would look up at Atticus, then down at the floor, and I wondered if he thought Atticus somehow responsible for Tom Robinson's conviction.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="亚历山德拉姑妈没睡，在等我们。她穿着睡衣。我敢发哲，里面还穿了件紧身胸衣。。我感到遗憾，哥哥。”她轻声地说。我从来没听过她称呼阿迪克斯为哥哥，于是偷偷地瞟了杰姆一眼。但是杰姆心不在焉。他一会儿抬头瞧着阿迪克斯，一会儿又低头盯着地板。我心想，莫非他认为阿迪克新对汤姆·鲁宾逊判罪负有什么责任。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He'll be so presently," said Atticus. "It was a little too strong for him." Our father sighed. "I'm going to bed," he said. "If I don't wake up in the morning, don't call me."</div>

<div class="line_en">We heard Dill's step in the hall, so Calpurnia left Atticus's uneaten breakfast on the table. Between rabbit-bites Dill told us of Miss Rachel's reaction to last night, which was: if a man like Atticus Finch wants to butt his head against a stone wall it's his head.</div>
