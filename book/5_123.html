<div class="line_en">She went on. It was what she'd always done in her life when disappointment set in. She tucked her chin, squared her shoulders, and set a new goal for herself. This year, she was starting a magazine. Next year it would be a retreat for women. After that, who knew?</div>

<div class="line_en">Two thousand six saw The Girlfriend Hour rise even higher in the ratings. Week after week, month after month, Tully created magic with her selection of guests and her rapport with the audience. She had definitely reached the top of her game and seized control of the board. No longer did she let herself think about what she didn't have in her life. Just as she'd done at six and ten and fourteen, she boxed all that negative stuff up and put it in the shadow box.</div>

<div class="line_en">How had it happened, after all their decades together, that they were estranged now? "I'm sorry, Katie," she whispered, hearing how small the words were; all her life she'd hoarded those few and simple words, kept them tucked inside her heart as if to let them out would harm her. Why, of all the lessons she should have learned from her mother, had she held on to this most hurtful one? And why hadn't she called when she'd heard Kate's voice on the answering machine?</div>

I should have told you that a long time ago." She made a tiny, desperate sound. If Kate didn't remember her, remember them, she didn't think she could bear it. "I remember when I first met you, Katie Mularkey Ryan. You were the first person who ever really wanted to know me. Naturally I treated you like shit at first, but when I got raped you were there for me." The memories overtook her. She wiped her eyes. "You're thinking I'm only talking about me, right? Typical, you say. But I remember you, too, Katie; every second. Like when you read Love Story and couldn't figure out what sonovabitch meant because it wasn't in the dictionary… or when you swore you'd never French-kiss because it was gross-o-rama." Tully shook her head, fighting to keep it together. Her whole life was in the room with them now. "We were so damned young, Katie. But we're not young anymore. You remember that first time I left Snohomish, and we wrote about a million letters? We signed them Forever friends… or Best friends forever. Which was it…"</div>

<div class="line_en">Panic always comes to me in the same way. First, I get a knot in the pit of my stomach that turns to nausea, then a fluttery breathlessness that no amount of deep breathing can cure. But what causes my fear is different every day; I never know what will set me off. It could be a kiss from my husband, or the lingering look of sadness in his eyes when he draws back. Sometimes I know he's already grieving for me, missing me even while I'm still here. Worse yet is Marah's quiet acceptance of everything I say. I would give anything for another of our old knock-down drag-out fights. That's one of the first things I'd say to you now, Marah: Those fights were real life. You were struggling to break free of being my daughter but unsure of how to be yourself, while I was afraid to let you go. It's the circle of love. I only wish I'd recognized it then. Your grandmother told me I'd know you were sorry for those years before you did, and she was right. I know you regret some of the things you said to me, as I regret my own words. None of that matters, though. I want you to know that. I love you and I know you love me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="恐慌总是以相同的方式来袭。首先，我感到胃部上方纠结，接着变成恶心，然后是急促喘息，做再多次深呼吸也无法舒缓。但是让我害怕的原因却每天不同，无法预知什么会让我发作，或许是老公的一个吻，也可能是他后退时眼中徘徊不去的哀伤。有时候我感觉得出来，虽然我还在，但他已经开始哀悼、想念。更让我难过的是，无论我说什么，玛拉都默默听从，我好希望能找回从前针锋相对的争吵，就算只有一次也好。玛拉，这是我想告诉你的第一件事：那些争吵才是真正的人生。你努力挣脱我女儿的身份，却还不清楚怎么做自己，而我则因为担心而无法放手。这是爱的循环，真希望我在当时就能懂。你外婆说过，有一天你会因叛逆期的行为感到抱歉，而我会比你先知道。我晓得有些话你后悔不该说出口，我也一样，不过现在都不重要了，我希望你知道。我爱你，我知道你也爱我。">查看中文翻译</div>

It's my story, and yours, too. It starts in 1960 in a small farming town up north, in a clapboard house on a hill above a horse pasture. When it gets good, though, is 1974, when the coolest girl in the world moved into the house across the street…</div>
