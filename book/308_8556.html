<div class="line_en">"Those alibis now. Worthless! Absolutely worthless. Got to start again. Find out what everyone was doing from nine-thirty onwards. Nine-thirty -- that's the time we've got to hang on to. You were quite right about the man Kent we don't release him yet awhile. Let me see now -- nineforty-five at the Dog and Whistle. He might have got there in a quarter of an hour if he ran. It's just possible that it was his voice Mr Raymond heard talking to Mr Ackroyd asking for money which Mr Ackroyd refused. But one thing's clear -- it wasn't he who sent the telephone message. The station is half a mile in the other direction -- over a mile and a half from the Dog and Whistle, and he was at the Dog and Whistle until about ten minutes past ten. Dang that telephone call! We always come up against it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那些不在场证明全部作废了！狗屁不值！又得从头再来。现在重点是九点半之后每个人的行踪。九点半——那才是关键的时间点。你对肯特的观点完全正确——眼下还不能释放他。我想想——九点四十五分在‘狗哨’酒吧，如果一路快跑，十五分钟来得及。雷蒙德先生听到有人和艾克罗伊德先生谈话，可能就是肯特——他向艾克罗伊德先生要钱，遭到拒绝。但可以明确的是，给谢泼德医生打电话报信的人不是他。车站在相反方向的半英里之外，离‘狗哨’酒吧的距离超过一英里半，而他十点十分左右才离开‘狗哨’。那通该死的电话！每次我们都卡在这个地方。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I saw the colour drain from the housekeeper's face, leaving it dead white. She leaned forward, her figure swaying.</div>

<div class="line_en">"It is not quite all," he said smoothly. "This morning fresh developments have arisen. It seems now that Mr Ackroyd was murdered, not at a quarter to ten, but before. Between ten minutes to nine, when Dr Sheppard left, and a quarter to ten."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我还没说完呢，”他心平气和地说，“今天早上又有新进展。现在看来，艾克罗伊德先生的遇害时间并不是九点四十五分，而是更早，从八点五十分谢泼德医生离开时起，到九点四十五分之间。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She was leaning forward. That iron self-control was broken through at last. Terror and desperation was in her face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她倾身向前，那钢铁般的自制力终于一溃千里，满脸恐惧与绝望。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I can tell you what he was doing there. He never touched a hair of old Ackroyd's head -- he never went near the study. He didn't do it, I tell you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我可以告诉您，他根本没碰老艾克罗伊德一根头发，而且一步也没靠近书房。我告诉您，不是他干的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"He came to see me." She spoke in a low, hurried voice. "I went out to meet him --"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他是来见我的，”她急急低声道，“我到屋外和他会面——”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Mademoiselle, it is the business ofHercule Poirot to know things. I know that you went out earlier in the evening, that you left a message in the summer-house to say what time you would be there."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“小姐，赫尔克里·波洛就是干这一行的。我知道，那天晚上您很早就出去过，在凉亭里留了张字条，提示他会面的时间。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"How do you know?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“您怎么会知道？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes, I did. I had heard from him -- saying he was coming. I dared not let him come to the house. I wrote to the address he gave me and said I would meet him in the summerhouse, and described it to him so that he would be able to find it. Then I was afraid he might not wait there patiently, and I ran out and left a piece of paper to say I would be there about ten minutes past nine. I didn't want the servants to see me, so I slipped out through the drawing-room window. As I came back, I met Dr Sheppard, and I fancied that he would think it queer. I was out of breath, for I had been running. I had no idea that he was expected to dinner that night." She paused.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没错。我收到他的信——说是要来庄园。我不敢让他进屋，因此就按他给的地址写了回信，说我会在凉亭里见他，又告诉他去凉亭怎么走。然后我又怕他等得不耐烦，所以跑出去在凉亭里留了张字条，说我大约九点十分到。我不想让仆人看见，所以才从客厅的落地窗出去。我回来时撞见了谢泼德医生，他肯定很奇怪，因为我是一路小跑赶回来的，弄得气喘吁吁。我事先并不知道他那天晚上会来赴宴。”她停住了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“从来没人知道这件事。那是很久以前——很久以前了——在肯特郡。我没结过婚⋯⋯”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"So you took the name of the county as a surname for him. I understand."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“因此您就用郡名作为他的姓氏，这我理解。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Mademoiselle," said Poirot, interrupting her, "in this matter I must have the whole truth. What you tell us need never go beyond these four walls. Dr Sheppard will be discreet, and so shall I. See, I will help you. This Charles Kent, he is your son, is he not?" She nodded. The colour had flamed into her cheeks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“小姐，”波洛打断了她，“关于这个问题，我必须知道全部事实才行。您所说的一切绝不会泄露到这间屋子之外。谢泼德医生会严守秘密，我也一样。我会帮助您。这位查尔斯·肯特就是您的儿子，对不对？”她点点头，满面通红。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I got work. I managed to pay for his board and lodging. I never told him that I was his mother. But he turned out badly, he drank, then took to drugs. I managed to pay his passage out to Canada. I didn't hear of him for a year or two. Then, somehow or other, he found out that I was his mother. He wrote asking me for money. Finally, I heard from him back in this country again. He was coming to see me at Fernly, he said. I dared not let him come to the house. I have always been considered so -- so very respectable. If anyone got an inkling -- it would have been all up with my post as housekeeper. So I wrote to him in the way I have just told you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我找了份工作，能够负担他的食宿费用。我从没告诉过他我是他的亲生母亲。但他后来走上了歧途，先是酗酒，后来又吸毒。我好不容易才攒够钱送他去了加拿大。有一两年他音讯全无，后来不知怎么搞的，他知道了我们的母子关系，写信向我要钱。最后他来信说要回英国，还要到芬利庄园来看我。我不敢让他进门。因为大家一直都很敬重我，一旦被人发现，我这份管家的工作就保不住了。所以我就像刚才说的那样，约他在凉亭碰面。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes. I wondered if something could be done. He was not a bad boy -- before he took to drugs."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，我想问问有没有什么对策。他染上毒瘾之前本性不坏。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes, he was waiting for me when I got there. He was very rough and abusive. I had brought with me all the money I had, and I gave it to him. We talked a little, and then he went away."</div>

<div class="line_en">"I had connected her with the unknown man long before we actually came face to face with him. As soon as we found that quill. The quill suggested dope, and I remembered your account of Miss Russell's visit to you. Then I found the article on cocaine in that morning's paper. It all seemed very clear. She had heard from someone that morning -- someone addicted to drugs, she read the article in the paper, and she came to ask you a few tentative questions. She mentioned cocaine, since the article in question was on cocaine. Then, when you seemed too interested, she switched hurriedly to the subject of detective stories and untraceable poisons. I suspected a son or a brother, or some other undesirable male relation. Ah! but I must go. It is the time of the lunch."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“早在去见查尔斯·肯特之前，我就把她和那个神秘人联系起来了。那是在我们发现那根鹅毛管的时候。鹅毛管意味着瘾君子，而你又提过拉塞尔小姐来看病的事。接着我注意到那天的晨报上有一篇关于可卡因的文章，于是豁然开朗。那天早晨她收到一封信——有人染上了毒瘾，她读了报上的文章之后，就跑来试探你几个问题。她提到了可卡因，因为那篇文章里说的就是可卡因。然后，当你来了兴致之后，她又赶快转移话题，聊起侦探小说和稀有毒药。所以我怀疑那家伙是她的儿子或兄弟，要么就是某个行为不检的亲戚。啊！我该走了，午饭时间到了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
