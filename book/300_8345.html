<div class="line_en">Gathering himself quickly up, he stood more erect, like a man taken by surprise in a mood to which he was reluctant to have witnesses. Throwing his eyes anxiously in the direction of the voice, he indistinctly beheld a form under the trees, clad in garments so, sombre, and so little relieved from the grey twilight into which the clouded sky and the heavy foliage had darkened the noontide, that he knew not whether it were a woman or a shadow. It may be, that his pathway through life was haunted thus, by a spectre that had stolen out from among his thoughts.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was no wonder that they thus questioned one another's actual and bodily existence, and even doubted of their own. So strangely did they meet, in the dim wood, that it was like the first encounter, in the world beyond the grave, of two spirits who had been intimately connected in their former life, but now stood coldly shuddering, in mutual dread; as not yet familiar with their state, nor wonted to the companionship of disembodied beings. Each a ghost, and awe-stricken at the other ghost! They were awe-stricken likewise at themselves; because the crisis flung back to them their consciousness, and revealed to each heart its history and experience, as life never does, except at such breathless epochs. The soul beheld its features in the mirror of the passing moment. It was with fear, and tremulously, and, as it were, by a slow, reluctant necessity, that Arthur Dimmesdale put forth his hand, chill as death, and touched the chill hand of Hester Prynne. The grasp, cold as it was, took away what was dreariest in the interview. They now felt themselves, at least, inhabitants of the same sphere.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他俩这样互相询问对方的肉体的实际存在，甚至怀疑自己还活着，是不足为奇的。他们在这幽暗的树林中如此不期而遇，简直象是两个幽灵，出了坟墓之后在世上首次避遁：他们的前世曾经关系密切，但如今却站在那里打着冷战，都让对方给吓坏了；似乎既不熟悉自己的状态，又不惯于与脱离了肉体的存在为伴。双方都是鬼魂，但又被对方的鬼魂吓得不知所措！他们其实也被自己吓得不知所措；因为这一紧急关头又重新勾起他们的意识，并向各自的心头揭示了自己的历史和经历，那是除去这种令人窒息的时刻，平常的人生中所从来没有的。灵魂在逝去的瞬间的镜子中看到了自己的模样。阿瑟·丁梅斯代尔恰恰是心怀恐惧，周身战抖，并且事实上缓慢而勉强地伸出他那死人一般冰冷的手，触摸到海丝特·白兰的发凉的手。这两手的相握虽然冷漠，但却驱散了相会时最阴沉的东西。他们此时至少感到双方是同一天地中的居民了。">查看中文翻译</div>

But, as matters stand with my soul, whatever of good capacity there originally was in me, all of God's gifts that were the choicest have become the ministers of spiritual torment. Hester, I am most miserable."</div>

<div class="line_en">"More misery, Hester! -- only the more misery!" answered the clergyman, with a bitter smile. "As concerns the good which I may appear to do, I have no faith in it. It must needs be a delusion. What can a ruined soul, like mine, effect towards the redemption of other souls? -- or a polluted soul, towards their purification? And as for the people's reverence, would that it were turned to scorn and hatred! Canst thou deem it, Hester, a consolation, that I must stand up in my pulpit, and meet so many eyes turned upward to my face, as if the light of heaven were beaming from it! -- must see my flock hungry for the truth, and listening to my words as if a tongue of Pentecost were speaking! -- and then look inward, and discern the black reality of what they idolise? I have laughed, in bitterness and agony of heart, at the contrast between what I seem and what I am! And Satan laughs at it!"</div>

<div class="line_en">"No, Hester, no!" replied the clergyman. "There is no substance in it! It is cold and dead, and can do nothing for me! Of penance, I have had enough! Of penitence, there has been none! Else, I should long ago have thrown off these garments of mock holiness, and have shown myself to mankind as they will see me at the judgment-seat. Happy are you, Hester, that wear the scarlet letter openly upon your bosom! Mine burns in secret! Thou little knowest what a relief it is, after the torment of a seven years' cheat, to look into an eye that recognises me for what I am! Had I one friend -- or were it my worst enemy! -- to whom, when sickened with the praises of all other men, I could daily betake myself, and be known as the vilest of all sinners, methinks my soul might keep itself alive thereby. Even thus much of truth would save me! But, now, it is all falsehood! -- all emptiness! -- all death!"</div>

<div class="line_en">Hester Prynne was now fully sensible of the deep injury for which she was responsible to this unhappy man, in permitting him to lie for so many years, or, indeed, for a single moment, at the mercy of one whose purposes could not be other than malevolent. The very contiguity of his enemy, beneath whatever mask the latter might conceal himself, was enough to disturb the magnetic sphere of a being so sensitive as Arthur Dimmesdale. There had been a period when Hester was less alive to this consideration; or, perhaps, in the misanthropy of her own trouble, she left the minister to bear what she might picture to herself as a more tolerable doom. But of late, since the night of his vigil, all her sympathies towards him had been both softened and invigorated. She now read his heart more accurately. She doubted not, that the continual presence of Roger Chillingworth the secret poison of his malignity, infecting all the air about him -- and his authorised interference, as a physician, with the minister's physical and spiritual infirmities -- that these bad opportunities had been turned to a cruel purpose. By means of them, the sufferer's conscience had been kept in an irritated state, the tendency of which was, not to cure by wholesome pain, but to disorganise and corrupt his spiritual being. Its result, on earth, could hardly fail to be insanity, and hereafter, that eternal alienation from the Good and True, of which madness is perhaps the earthly type.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="海丝特·白兰如今才充分意识到，这个不幸的男人所受的伤害有多深，她对此是有责任的，她不该允许那个一心抱着恶毒动机的人在他身边摆布他这么些年，其实即使是一瞬间也不该的。那个心怀叵测的人不管蒙上什么面具来遮掩，仅仅接近一下象阿瑟，丁梅斯代尔那样敏感的人，就足以扰乱他的方寸了。有一段时间，海丝特没怎么动脑筋考虑这一点；也许是因为她自己痛不欲生，而把他的厄运看得比较容易忍受，也就没去过问他。但自从他那天晚上夜游以来，最近她对他的全部同情都变得又温柔又有力了。如今她对他的心看得更准了。她毫不怀疑，罗杰·齐灵渥斯没日没夜地守在他身边，他那不可告人的险恶用心毒化了他周围的气氛，他那医生的身分对牧师的身心痈疾具有权威性的影响——这一切都构成了达到残酷目的的可乘之机。凡此种种，使那个受苦人的良心始终处于一种烦躁状态，长此以往，不但不会以有益健康的痛苦治愈他，反而会紊乱和腐蚀他的精神生命。其结果，他在世间难以不弄得精神错乱，之后则与“真”和“善”永远绝缘，其现世的表现就是疯狂。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The minister looked at her, for an instant, with all that violence of passion, which -- intermixed, in more shapes than one, with his higher, purer, softer qualities -- was, in fact, the portion of him which the Devil claimed, and through which he sought to win the rest. Never was there a blacker or a fiercer frown than Hester now encountered. For the brief space that it lasted, it was a dark transfiguration. But his character had been so much enfeebled by suffering, that even its lower energies were incapable of more than a temporary struggle. He sank down on the ground, and buried his face in his hands.</div>

<div class="line_en">Such was the ruin to which she had brought the man, once -- nay, why should we not speak it? -- still so passionately loved! Hester felt that the sacrifice of the clergyman's good name, and death itself, as she had already told Roger Chillingworth, would have been infinitely preferable to the alternative which she had taken upon herself to choose. And now, rather than have had this grievous wrong to confess, she would gladly have lain down on the forest-leaves, and died there, at Arthur Dimmesdale's feet.</div>

O Hester Prynne, thou little, little knowest all the horror of this thing!

All the world had frowned on her -- for seven long years had it frowned upon this lonely woman -- and still she bore it all, nor ever once turned away her firm, sad eyes.

<div class="line_en">"Thou must dwell no longer with this man," said Hester, slowly and firmly. "Thy heart must be no longer under his evil eye!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你不能继续跟他住在一起了，”海丝特说，语气徐缓而坚定。“你的心再也不能处于他那双邪恶的眼睛的监视之下了！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"And I! -- how am I to live longer, breathing the same air with this deadly enemy?" exclaimed Arthur Dimmesdale, shrinking within himself, and pressing his hand nervously against his heart -- a gesture that had grown involuntary with him. "Think for me, Hester! Thou art strong. Resolve for me!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可是我啊！——同这样一个死对头呼吸同一处的空气，我又怎么能够活得长久呢？”阿瑟·丁梅斯代尔惊呼着，心里一沉，神经质地用手去捂住心口——他的这种姿势已经变得不由自主了。“为我想一想吧，海丝特！你是坚强的。替我想个办法吧！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Alas, what a ruin has befallen thee!" said Hester, with the tears, gushing into her eyes. "Wilt thou die for very weakness? There is no other cause!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“天啊！你已经给毁成什么样子啦！”海丝特说着，泪水涌进了她的眼睛。“你难道就因为软弱而要死吗？此外再没有别的原因了！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It were far worse than death!" replied the minister. "But how to avoid it? What choice remains to me? Shall I lie down again on these withered leaves, where I cast myself when thou didst tell me what he was? Must I sink down there, and die at once?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这可比死还要糟糕得多！”牧师应道。“但是怎么来避免呢？我还有什么选择呢？你刚才告诉我他是什么人时，我就一屁股坐在了这些枯叶上，可是我还要倒在这里吗？我应该沉沦于此，并且马上死掉吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Is the world, then, so narrow?" exclaimed Hester Prynne, fixing her deep eyes on the minister's, and instinctively exercising a magnetic power over a spirit so shattered and subdued that it could hardly hold itself erect. "Doth the universe lie within the compass of yonder town, which only a little time ago was but a leaf-strewn desert, as lonely as this around us? Whither leads yonder forest-track? Backward to the settlement, thou sayest! Yes; but onward, too! Deeper it goes, and deeper, into the wilderness, less plainly to be seen at every step; until, some few miles hence, the yellow leaves will show no vestige of the white man's tread. There thou art free! So brief a journey would bring thee from a world where thou hast been most wretched, to one where thou mayest still be happy! Is there not shade enough in all this boundless forest to hide thy heart from the gaze of Roger Chillingworth?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你说，这世界是这么狭小吗？”海丝特·白兰一边高声说着，一边用她那深沉的目光注视着牧师的眼睛，她的目光本能地有一种磁石般的效力，作用在那涣散消沉得简直无法撑持自己的精神之上。“难道整个天地就只在那边那小镇的范围之内吗？只在不久之前，那里还是一片撒满落时的荒野，和我们现在呆的这地方差不多凄凉。那林中小径是通往何处的呢？你会说，是返回居民区的！不错；但是还可以再往前走啊。它越往深处去，就更源源地通向蛮荒野地，每走一步，人们就会越看不清它，直到再走不多久，枯黄的落叶上便不见白人的足迹了。到那里，你就自由了！只消走这短短的一程路，就可以把你从使你万分苦恼的世界带到你仍可享受到幸福的地方！在这无边无际的大森林里难道还没有一处树荫足以将你的心隐藏起来，不让罗杰·齐灵渥斯监视吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The judgment of God is on me," answered the conscience-stricken priest. "It is too mighty for me to struggle with!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“上帝的裁判正落在我身上，”那位受到良心震撼的牧师回答说。“那力量太强大，我挣扎不动了！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It cannot be!" answered the minister, listening as if he were called upon to realise a dream. "I am powerless to go! Wretched and sinful as I am, I have had no other thought than to drag on my earthly existence in the sphere where Providence hath placed me. Lost as my own soul is, I would still do what I may for other human souls! I dare not quit my post, though an unfaithful sentinel, whose sure reward is death and dishonour, when his dreary watch shall come to an end!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那可不成！”牧师回答，听他那口气，就象是要他去实现一场梦。“我根本没力气去。象我这样一个悲惨的罪人，只有—个念头，就是在上天已经安排给我的地域里了此残生。既然我已经失去了自己的灵魂，我只有继续尽我所能来拯救别的灵魂！虽说我是个不忠于职守的哨兵，等到这种沉网的守望终了的时候，我所能得到的报酬只能是不光彩的死亡，但我仍不敢擅离岗位！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"O Hester!" cried Arthur Dimmesdale, in whose eyes a fitful light, kindled by her enthusiasm, flashed up and died away, "thou tellest of running a race to a man whose knees are tottering beneath him! I must die here! There is not the strength or courage left me to venture into the wide, strange, difficult world, alone!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“噢，海丝特！”阿瑟·丁梅斯代尔喊道，她的热情在他的眼中燃起一道闪光，亮了一下就又熄灭了，“你是在鼓励一个两膝发抖的人去赛跑！我身上已经没有力量和勇气独自到那广袤、陌生和困难的天地去闯荡了！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Then there is the broad pathway of the sea!" continued Hester. "It brought thee hither. If thou so choose, it will bear thee back again. In our native land, whether in some remote rural village or in vast London -- or, surely, in Germany, in France, in pleasant Italy -- thou wouldst be beyond his power and knowledge! And what hast thou to do with all these iron men, and their opinions? They have kept thy better part in bondage too long already!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“何况还有海上的宽阔航道！”海丝特继续说。“是它把你带到了这里。只要你愿意，它还可以把你再送回去。在我们的祖国，不管是在偏僻的农村，还是在大城市伦敦——或者，当然还有德国、法国、以及令人愉快的意大利，——你都会超出他努力所及并且不为他所知晓！到那时，你与这些铁石心肠的人们，还有他们的看法，又有什么关系呢？他们已经尽其所能把你禁锢这么久了！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes, Hester; but only under the fallen leaves!" replied the minister, with a sad smile.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是有的，海丝特；不过只是在这些落叶之下！”牧师苦笑着回答说。">查看中文翻译</div>
