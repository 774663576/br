<div class="line_en">Impossible to answer. Because no, I didn't push her away. I didn't add to her pain or do anything to hurt her. Instead, I left her alone in that room.

<div class="line_en">Soon after Clay left, the couple from the couch walked into the bedroom. Actually, stumbled into the bedroom is more accurate. Remember them? I thought she was acting drunk, bumping into me so we'd get up and leave. Unfortunately, it wasn't an act. She was smashed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="柯磊走后没一会儿，沙发上那两人走进了卧室。其实更确切地说是趔趄着倒进卧室。还记得他俩吗？起初我还以为她是装醉，碰撞我，好撵我俩走开。不幸的是，她没装醉。她是烂醉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Her sofa buddy kept her from stumbling too hard into the nightstand. And when she rolled off the bed… twice… he lifted her back on. Nice guy that he was, he kept the laughter to a minimum.</div>

<div class="line_en">Hannah wasn't my first kiss, but the first kiss that mattered; the first kiss with someone who mattered. And after talking with her for so long that night, I assumed it was just the beginning. Something was happening between us. Something right. I felt it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="汉娜不是我的初吻，但那是我第一个认认真真的吻；是第一次和我真正在乎的人的吻。那天晚上的长谈之后，我自然以为这只是个开始。我俩之间会有进展。顺当地进展。我都能感觉到。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他没有离开，而是开始亲吻她。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I know, some of you would have easily stayed for such an amazing voyeuristic opportunity. A close encounter of the sexual kind. Even if you never saw it, at least you'd hear it.</div>

<div class="line_en">But two things kept me down on that floor. With my forehead pressed against my knees, I realized how much I must've drank that night. And with my balance not what it should've been, to run across the floor felt a little hazardous.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="这是借口之一。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Excuse number two is that things seemed to be winding down up there. Not only was she drunk and clumsy, she seemed to be completely unresponsive. From what I could tell, it didn't go much beyond kissing. And it seemed to be one-sided kissing at that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="借口之二是，好像一切是在尘埃落定。她不仅仅是醉得迷迷糊糊，她好像完全没有反应。据我看，好像就只是亲吻而已。而且显然是单方面的亲吻。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Again, nice guy that he was, he didn't take advantage of the situation. He wanted to. He tried for the longest time to get a reaction out of her. "Are you still awake? Do you want me to take you to the bathroom? Are you gonna puke?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="果然是好人一个，他并没有乘机占便宜。他是想的。他花了好长时间想得到她的回应：“你醒着吗？要不要我带你去卫生间？想不想吐？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="女孩没有完全失去知觉。她口舌不清地哼哼着，呻吟着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It dawned on him -- finally -- that she wasn't in a romantic mood and probably wouldn't be for a while. So he tucked her in and said he'd check on her in a bit. Then he left.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最终他总算明白过来，她并不处于浪漫的情绪之中，一时半刻可能也不会。于是他把她放到床上，说过会儿来看她。随后就出去了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Your shoes -- the shadow of your shoes -- were still visible in the light coming under the door. Because when you left that room, you took up post right outside.

And when footsteps fell within the room -- several songs after he entered the room -- I pressed my back against the closet wall… waiting. Waiting for the closet doors to be torn open. To be yanked out of my hiding place.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我双膝跪在地板上，能感觉到过道里人的走动。等到房间里传来脚步声——他进屋后几支曲子的工夫——我背靠着橱壁……等着。等着壁橱门被拉开。被呵斥着赶出我的藏身之处。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="别担心，我暗想。我不会吐在车里的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="就在那峰屋子前，我吐了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We'd come a long way, Justin. From the first time I watched you slip on Kat's lawn. To my first kiss at the bottom of the slide. To now.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="咱俩走过好长一段路，贾斯汀。从最初我看着你在凯特家的草坪前滑倒，到滑梯下我的初吻。直到此时此刻。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So what happened next? Well, I ran out of the room and straight down the hall. And that's where I saw you. Sitting in a room all by yourself. The person this whole tape revolves around… Justin Foley.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那接下来呢？嗯，我跑出房间，径直冲向过道。就在那儿我看到了你。独自一人坐在一个房间里。整面磁带都在讲述的这个人…贾斯汀·弗利。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Justin, baby, I'm not blaming you entirely. We're in this one together. We both could have stopped it. Either one of us. We could have saved her. And I'm admitting this to you. To all of you. That girl had two chances. And both of us let her down.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="贾斯汀，宝贝，我并不完全责怪你。咱俩都有份。咱俩本来是可以阻止的。谁都行。咱俩是可以保护她的。这点我向你，向你们大伙儿供认不讳。那女孩有两次机会。咱俩都丢下了她。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="那这面磁带讲的为什么是贯斯汀呢？另外那个呢？他的行为难道不是更恶劣吗？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Yes. Absolutely yes. But the tapes need to be passed on. And if I sent them to him, they would stop. Think about it. He raped a girl and would leave town in a second if he knew… well… if he knew that we knew.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="是的，一点没错。但磁带得传下去。如果我把磁带给他，就传不下去了。你想，他强奸了一个女孩，如果他知道……唉……如果他知道我们大伙儿都知道这事，他马上就会出走。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“什么也没傲，”他说，“我说的是实话。”从他在罗西快餐店朝我走来到现在，托尼第一次与我目光相交。借助不远处路灯的光线，我看到他眼中泪光闪闪。“把这面听完，柯磊，我再从头跟你说。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It must be denial. It has to be. Sure, he's always had a temper. Sure, he goes through girls like used underwear. But he's always been a good friend to you.

<div class="line_cn" title="是为了否认。只能如此。没错，他一向脾气不好。没错，他把女孩子看做旧衣服。可他一向是你的哥们。你跟他一起玩得越久，就越像是老朋友，对不对？他要是老朋友，那就不会做出什么错事。也就意味着你也一样不会傲什么错事。">查看中文翻译</div>
