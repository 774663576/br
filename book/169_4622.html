<div class="line_en">Arianne took solace from that. Why would her father go to such great pains to provide for her comfort in captivity if he had marked her for a traitor's death? He cannot mean to kill me, she told herself a hundred times. He does not have it in him to be so cruel. I am his blood and seed, his heir, his only daughter. If need be, she would throw herself beneath the wheels of his chair, admit her fault, and beg him for his pardon. And she would weep. When he saw tears rolling down her face, he would forgive her.</div>

<div class="line_en">Arianne expected to be brought before her father's high seat beneath the dome of leaded glass in the Tower of the Sun. Instead, Hotah delivered her to the Spear Tower, and the custody of her father's seneschal Ricasso and Ser Manfrey Martell, the castellan. "Princess," Ricasso said, "you will forgive an old blind man if he does not make the climb with you. These legs are not equal to so many steps. A chamber has been prepared for you. Ser Manfrey shall escort you there, to await the prince's pleasure."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="亚莲恩以为自己会被带往太阳塔拱顶的镶铅玻璃窗下，父亲的高背座椅跟前。然而何塔却将她带到长矛塔，交给父亲的管家里卡索和城主曼佛里。马泰尔爵士。“公主，”里卡索说，“请原谅一个盲眼老人不能随你一起攀登，我这把老骨头无法驾御长长的阶梯。屋子为你准备好了，曼佛里爵士会带你去，请等待亲王心情好转时再作指示。”">查看中文翻译</div>

Arianne had been parted from Garin, Drey, and the others after capture, and Hotah had refused to say what would be done with them. "That is for the prince to decide," was all the captain had to say upon the subject. Ser Manfrey proved a bit more forthcoming. "They were taken to the Planky Town and will be conveyed by ship to Ghaston Grey, until such time as Prince Doran decides their fate."</div>

<div class="line_en">"He thought you might." Ser Manfrey took her arm and marched her up the steps, up and up until her breath grew short.

<div class="line_cn" title="“他料到你会这么说。”曼佛里爵士搀着她的胳膊，领她登上阶梯，越走越高，直到她的呼吸渐渐急促。长矛塔高达一百五十尺，而她的房间接近顶端。亚莲恩打量着经过的每一扇门，不知其中是否锁着“沙蛇”。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ghaston Grey was a crumbling old castle perched on a rock in the Sea of Dorne, a drear and dreadful prison where the vilest of criminals were sent to rot and die. "Does my father mean to kill them?" Arianne could not believe it. "All they did they did for love for me. If my father must have blood, it should be mine."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="灰怖堡是座残破的古堡，位于多恩海中一块大礁石上，作为一所阴森恐怖的监狱，要犯们往往会被送去那里消磨至死。“我父亲要他们的命？”亚莲恩难以置信，“他们所作所为全是为了我，为了对我的爱。父亲的惩罚，应该冲我来。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When her own door had been closed and barred, Arianne explored her new home. Her cell was large and airy, and did not lack for comforts. There were Myrish carpets on the floor, red wine to drink, books to read. In one corner stood an ornate cyvasse table with pieces carved of ivory and onyx, though she had no one to play with even if she had been so inclined. She had a featherbed to sleep in, and a privy with a marble seat, sweetened by a basketful of herbs. This high up, the views were splendid. One window opened to the east, so she could watch the sun rise above the sea. The other allowed her to look down upon the Tower of the Sun, and the Winding Walls and Threefold Gate beyond.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="等自己的房门被关闭上闩，亚莲恩开始探索新家。房间宽敞通风，不乏装点，地上铺密尔地毯，有红酒可喝，还有书可读。角落里立着一张席瓦斯棋桌，棋子由象牙和玛瑙雕刻而成，但即使她想下棋，也没对手。她有一张羽毛床，还有一个带大理石座位的厕所，内置一篮药草以消除异味。高处的景观十分壮丽，一扇窗朝东，她可以看到海上的日出，另一扇让她可以俯瞰太阳塔、曲墙和三重门。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">That night she cried herself to sleep… for the first time, if not the last. Even in her dreams she found no peace. She dreamt of Arys Oakheart caressing her, smiling at her, telling her that he loved her… but all the while the quarrels were in him and his wounds were weeping, turning his whites to red. Part of her knew it was a nightmare, even as she dreamt it. Come morning all of this will vanish, the princess told herself, but when morning came, she was still in her cell, Ser Arys was still dead, and Myrcella… I never wanted that, never. I meant the girl no harm. All I wanted was for her to be a queen. If we had not been betrayed…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当晚她哭着入睡…从头到尾。即使在梦中，她也无法平静。她梦到亚历斯·奥克赫特爵士的爱抚和微笑，梦见他爱的宣言…但弩箭始终钉在他身上，伤口流的血，把白袍染成红色。她隐隐知道这是个噩梦。到了清晨，一切都会过去，公主告诉自己，但清晨来临时，她仍在牢里，亚历斯爵士仍是死了，而弥赛菈…我没想过这样，没想过。我没想过加害那女孩，只想让她当上女王。倘若我们没被出卖…">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The exploration took less time than it would have taken her to lace a pair of sandals, but at least it served to keep the tears at bay for a time. Arianne found a basin and a flagon of cool water and washed her hands and face, but no amount of scrubbing could cleanse her of her grief. Arys, she thought, my white knight. Tears filled her eyes, and suddenly she was weeping, her whole body wracked by sobs. She remembered how Hotah's heavy axe had cleaved through his flesh and bone, the way his head had gone spinning through the air. Why did you do it? Why throw your life away? I never told you to, I never wanted that, I only wanted… I wanted… I wanted…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="探索房间花的工夫还不及她平时系一双凉鞋，但至少让她暂时忍住了泪水。亚莲恩找到一个水盆和一壶凉水，洗了洗手和脸，可无论如何用力地擦，都拭不去悲哀。亚历斯，她心想，我的白骑士。泪水盈满眼眶，突然间，她哭了，整个身子都在抽搐。她回想起何塔沉重的长斧如何劈砍他的血肉和骨头，他的脑袋如何在空中旋转。你为何要这么做？为何要抛弃生命？我没想过要你这样，我不希望你这样，我只想…只想…只想…">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She expected him that day, but when the door finally opened it proved to be only the servants with her midday meal. "When might I see my father?" she asked, but none of them would answer. The kid had been roasted with lemon and honey. With it were grape leaves stuffed with a mélange of raisins, onions, mushrooms, and fiery dragon peppers. "I am not hungry," Arianne said. Her friends would be eating ship's biscuits and salt beef on their way to Ghaston Grey. "Take this away and bring me Prince Doran." But they left the food, and her father did not come. After a while, hunger weakened her resolve, so she sat and ate.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她以为他当天就会来，但等门终于打开时，却原来只是仆人们送午餐。“我什么时候可以见父亲？”她问。无人回答。仆人们送上柠檬和蜂蜜烤的小山羊，葡萄叶间塞满了葡萄干、洋葱、蘑菇和火龙椒。“我不饿，”亚莲恩说。她的朋友们正在去灰怖堡的船上吃饼干和腌牛肉。“把这些拿走，给我把道朗亲王请来。”他们留下食物，父亲却没有来。过了一会儿，饥饿削弱了决心，她坐下来吃东西。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She found a cedar chest full of her clothes at the foot of her bed, so she stripped out of the travel-stained garb she had slept in and donned the most revealing garments she could find, wisps of silk that covered everything and hid nothing. Prince Doran might treat her like a child, but she refused to dress like one. She knew such garb would discomfit her father when he came to chastise her for making off with Myrcella. She counted on it. If I must crawl and weep, let him be uncomfortable as well.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她在床脚发现一只雪松木箱，里面装满她的衣服，于是她脱下风尘仆仆的外衣——最近她都合衣而眠——找出一件最暴露的丝衣，缕缕丝绸遮盖一切，却什么都没藏住。道朗亲王对待她也许就像对待小孩子，但她不会穿成小孩模样。如果父亲前来斥责她拐带弥赛菈出逃，这样的服装会让他困扰。她指望着这一点。如果我必须匍匐哭泣，就要发挥最大的功效。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Someone told," Hotah had said. The memory still made her angry. Arianne clung to that, feeding the flame within her heart. Anger was better than tears, better than grief, better than guilt. Someone told, someone she had trusted. Arys Oakheart had died because of that, slain by the traitor's whisper as much as by the captain's axe. The blood that had streamed down Myrcella's face, that was the betrayer's work as well. Someone told, someone she had loved. That was the cruelest cut of all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“有人告密。”何塔说过，而这仍然令她愤怒。亚莲恩不停回忆，往心中的怒火添加燃料。怒火强于泪水，强于悲伤，强于黯然神伤。有人告密，某个她信任的人害死了亚历斯·奥克赫特，他的死，虽是由于侍卫队长的斧头，更由于叛徒的告密，弥赛菈脸上的血也是那叛徒造成的。有人告密，某个她爱的人。这是最残酷的伤口。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Finally, she crawled back onto the featherbed. The world had grown dark, and there was little she could do but sleep. Someone told, she thought. Someone told. Garin, Drey, and Spotted Sylva were friends of her girlhood, as dear to her as her cousin Tyene. She could not believe they would inform on her… but that left only Darkstar, and if he was the betrayer, why had he turned his sword on poor Myrcella? He wanted to kill her instead of crowning her, he said as much at Shandystone. He said that was how I'd get the war I wanted. But it made no sense for Dayne to be the traitor. If Ser Gerold had been the worm in the apple, why would he have turned his sword upon Myrcella?</div>

<div class="line_en">Once the food was gone, there was nothing else for Arianne to do. She paced around her tower, twice and thrice and three times thrice. She sat beside the cyvasse table and idly moved an elephant. She curled up in the window seat and tried to read a book, until the words became a blur and she realized that she was crying again. Arys, my sweet, my white knight, why did you do it? You should have yielded. I tried to tell you, but the words caught in my mouth. You gallant fool, I never meant for you to die, or for Myrcella… oh, gods be good, that little girl…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="等食物吃完，亚莲恩就没事可干了。她绕着房间转圈，一圈，两圈，三圈，然后再绕三遍，再三圈。她坐到席瓦斯棋桌边，漫无目的地移动一只象。她蜷在临窗座位里看书，直到文字变得一片模糊，她意识到自己又在哭了。亚历斯，我亲爱的，我的白骑士，你为何要这么做？你应该投降。我要你投降，却没说出口。你这英勇的傻瓜，我没想要你死，也没想过让弥赛菈…噢，诸神慈悲，那小女孩…">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Someone told. When her father came to see her, she would learn which one. Prince Doran did not come the next day, though. Nor the day after. The princess was left alone to pace, and weep, and nurse her wounds. During the daylight hours she would try to read, but the books that they had given her were deadly dull: ponderous old histories and geographies, annotated maps, a dry-as-dust study of the laws of Dorne, The Seven-Pointed Star and Lives of the High Septons, a huge tome about dragons that somehow made them about as interesting as newts. Arianne would have given much and more for a copy of Ten Thousand Ships or The Loves of Queen Nymeria, anything to occupy her thoughts and let her escape her tower for an hour or two, but such amusements were denied her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有人告密。等父亲来见她时，她会知道是哪一个。然而道朗亲王第二天没有来，第三天也没有来。公主只能独自徘徊哭泣，舔舐伤口。她白天看书，可他们提供的书无聊之极，尽是冗长的古代历史与地理，带注解的地图册，枯燥乏味的多恩律法研究，外加《七星圣经》、《历代总主教纪事》和厚厚一大本关于龙的书，亚莲恩觉得书中的龙几乎跟蝾螈一样无趣。她情愿不惜代价换一本《万船远航记》或《娜梅莉亚女王的爱情》，任何能占据思绪的东西都行，好让她逃离高塔一两个小时。但她得不到这样的消遣。">查看中文翻译</div>

They brought her meals, changed her bed, and emptied the chamber pot beneath her privy, but none would speak with her. When she required more wine, Timoth would fetch it. If she desired some favorite food, figs or olives or peppers stuffed with cheese, she need only tell Belandra, and it would appear.

The last she had seen of the other princess had been on their ride back to Sunspear. Too weak to sit a horse, Myrcella had traveled in a litter, her head bound up in silken bandages where Darkstar slashed at her, her green eyes bright with fever.

<div class="line_en">It was no good dwelling endlessly on Ser Arys, she knew. Instead, she made herself think about the Sand Snakes, Tyene especially. Arianne loved all her bastard cousins, from prickly, hot-tempered Obara to little Loreza, the youngest, only six years old. Tyene had always been the one she loved the most, though; the sweet sister that she never had. The princess had never been close to her brothers; Quentyn was off at Yronwood, and Trystane was too young. No, it had always been her and Tyene, with Garin and Drey and Spotted Sylva. Nym would sometimes join them in their sport, and Sarella was forever pushing in where she didn't belong, but for the most part they had been a company of five. They splashed in the pools and fountains of the Water Gardens, and rode into battle perched on one another's naked backs. She and Tyene had learned to read together, learned to ride together, learned to dance together. When they were ten Arianne had stolen a flagon of wine, and the two of them had gotten drunk together.

<div class="line_en">The more she thought about her cousins, the more the princess missed them. For all I know, they might be right below me. That night Arianne tried pounding on the floor with the heel of her sandal. When no one answered, she leaned out a window and peered down. She could see other windows below, smaller than her own, some no more than arrow loops. "Tyene!" she called. "Tyene, are you there? Obara, Nym? Can you hear me? Ellaria? Anyone? TYENE?" The princess spent half the night hanging out the window, calling till her throat was raw, but no answering shouts came back to her. That frightened her more than she could say. If the Sand Snakes were imprisoned in the Spear Tower, they surely would have heard her shouting. Why didn't they answer? If Father has done them harm, I will never forgive him, never, she told herself.</div>

<div class="line_en">Arianne decided that she must needs be more subtle. Cedra was her best hope; the girl was young, naive, and gullible. Garin had boasted of bedding her once, the princess recalled. The next time she bathed, as Cedra soaped her shoulders, she began to talk of everything and nothing. "I know you have been commanded not to speak to me," she said, "but no one told me not to speak to you." She spoke about the heat of the day, and what she'd had last night for supper, and how slow and stiff poor Belandra was becoming. Prince Oberyn had armed each of his daughters so they need never be defenseless, but Arianne Martell had no weapon but her guile. And so she smiled and charmed, and asked nothing in return of Cedra, neither word nor nod.</div>

By now Ser Gerold might well have been taken, however; if not, he would surely have fled Dorne. Her next thought was of Garin's mother and the orphans of the Greenblood. No, not them. It must be someone with real power, someone who had no part of our plot yet might have reason to be sympathetic to us.

<div class="line_en">The most powerful of the Dornish lords was Anders Yronwood, the Bloodroyal, Lord of Yronwood and Warden of the Stone Way, but Arianne knew better than to look for help from the man who had fostered her brother Quentyn. No. Drey's brother Ser Deziel Dalt had once aspired to marry her, but he was much too dutiful to go against his prince. Besides, whilst the Knight of Lemonwood might intimidate a petty lord, he did not have the strength to sway the Prince of Dorne. No. The same was true of Spotted Sylva's father.

I take some small solace in knowing that he died a cruel death at the hands of the monster that he himself begot. Be that as it may.
