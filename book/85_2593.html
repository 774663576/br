<div class="line_en">The racetrack is crowded with summer customers. The women wear straw sunhats and the men smoke cigars. Eddie and Noel leave work early to play Eddie's birthday number, 39, in the Daily Double. They sit on slatted fold-down seats. At their feet are paper cups of beer, amidst a carpet of discarded tickets.</div>

<div class="line_en">Earlier, Eddie won the first race of the day. He'd put half of those winnings on the second race and won that as well, the first time such a thing had ever happened to him. That gave him $209. After losing twice in smaller bets, he put it all on a horse to win in the sixth, because, as he and Noel agreed, in exuberant logic, he'd arrived with next to nothing, so what harm done if he went home the same way?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="早些时快，爱迪已经赢了第一场马。他把赢来的钱押了一半在第二场马上，又赢了，这可是从来没有过的事情。他赢了二百零九美元。输了两次小赌之后，他把剩下的钱第六次全部赌在一匹马上，他和诺埃尔兴高采烈地想，反正他们来的时候也几乎一无所有。空手回家又怎么样？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The bell rings. The horses are off. They bunch together on the far straightaway, their colorful silks blurring with their bumpy movement. Eddie has No. 8, a horse named Jersey Finch, which isn't a bad gamble, not at four to one, but what Noel has just said about "the kid"-- the one Eddie and Marguerite are planning to adopt -- flushes him with guilt. They could have used that money. Why did he do things like this?</div>

<div class="line_en">What he does not know is that Marguerite, unable to call him back, has chosen to drive to the track and find him. She feels badly about yelling, this being his birthday, and she wants to apologize; she also wants him to stop. She knows from evenings past that Noel will insist they stay until closing -- Noel is like that. And since the track is only ten minutes away, she grabs her handbag and drives their secondhand Nash Rambler down Ocean Parkway. She turns right on Lester Street. The sun is gone and the sky is in flux. Most of the cars are coming from the other direction. She approaches the Lester Street overpass, which used to be how customers reached the track, up the stairs, over the street and back down the stairs again, until the track owners paid the city for a traffic light, which left the overpass, for the most part, deserted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他不知道的是，玛格丽特因为没办法打电话找他，所以决定开车来跑马场。在他过生日的时候朝他嚷嚷，她感到很难过，她想向他道歉，她也不想让他再赌下去了。凭着她以往的经验，诺埃尔会坚持一直待到跑马场关门－－诺埃尔就是那样。跑马场离她家只有十分钟的车程，她抓起地的手袋，坐进他们的纳什蓝布勒牌二手车，顺着海滨大道开去。她向右拐上了莱斯特街。太阳已经落山了，天空处于不断的变化中。大部分汽车迎面而来。她把车开到了莱斯特街的天桥下，这座天桥过去曾经是去跑马场的必经之路，客人们走上楼梯，跨过街道，再从楼梯上走下来；后来，跑马场付钱给市政府，建丁一盏交通灯，这座天桥便基本上废弃不用了。">查看中文翻译</div>

It holds two teenagers who do not want to be found, two 17-year-olds who, hours earlier, had been chased from a liquor store after stealing five cartons of cigarettes and three pints of Old Harper's whiskey. Now, having finished the alcohol and smoked many of the cigarettes, they are bored with the evening, and they dangle their empty bottles over the lip of the rusted railing.</div>

She is wondering what section of the grandstand to look in, even as the Old Harper's whiskey bottle smashes her windshield into a spray of flying glass. Her car veers into the concrete divider. Her body is tossed like a doll slamming against the door and the dashboard and the steering wheel, lacerating her liver and breaking her arm and thumping her head so hard she loses touch with the sounds of the evening. She does not hear the screeching of cars. She does not hear the honking of horns.

<div class="line_en">The accident on Lester Street sent Marguerite to the hospital. She was confined to bed rest for nearly six months. Her injured liver recovered eventually, but the expense and the delay cost them the adoption. The child they were expecting went to someone else. The unspoken blame for this never found a resting place -- it simply moved like a shadow from husband to wife. Marguerite went quiet for a long time. Eddie lost himself in work. The shadow took a place at their table and they ate in its presence, amid the lonely clanking of forks and plates. When they spoke, they spoke of small things. The water of their love was hidden beneath the roots. Eddie never bet the horses again. His visits with Noel came to a gradual end, each of them unable to discuss much over breakfast that didn't feel like an effort.</div>

<div class="line_en">An amusement park in California introduced the first tubular steel tracks -- they twisted at severe angles unachievable with wood -- and suddenly, roller coasters, which had faded to near oblivion, were back in fashion. Mr. Bullock, the park owner, had ordered a steel-track model for Ruby Pier, and Eddie oversaw the construction. He barked at the installers, checking their every move. He didn't trust anything this fast. Sixty-degree angles? He was sure someone would get hurt. Anyhow, it gave him a distraction.</div>

The riders floated through troughs of water and dropped, at the end, into a large splash pool. Eddie couldn't figure why people so loved getting wet, when the ocean was 300 yards away. But he maintained it just the same, working shoeless in the water, ensuring that the boats never loosened from the tracks.</div>

In the mornings, she made him toast and coffee, and he dropped her at her cleaning job then drove back to the pier.

<div class="line_en">In the final days, when cancer was ruled the victor, the doctors said only, "Rest. Take it easy." When she asked questions, they nodded sympathetically, as if their nods were medicine doled out with a dropper. She realized this was protocol, their way of being nice while being helpless, and when one of them suggested "getting your affairs in order," she asked to be released from the hospital. She told more than asked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在最后的日子里，当癌症被判定获胜时，医生们只是说，“多休息。别着急。”当她提出问题时，他们会同情地点头，一下一下好像从滴管里勉强挤出来的药水。她意识到这不过是客套，是他们无能为力时好心的表示，当一个医生建议她“把事情料理好”的时候，她要求出院了。与其说她是要求出院的，不如说她是通知医生她要出院的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Two days later, she awoke with a scream. He drove her to the hospital in the predawn silence. They spoke in short sentences, what doctor might be on, who Eddie should call. And even though she was sitting in the seat next to him, Eddie felt her in everything, in the steering wheel, in the gas pedal, in the blinking of his eye, in the clearing of his throat. Every move he made was about hanging on to her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两天之后，她惊叫一声醒来。他在破晓前的沉寂中开车送她去医院。他们简短地说着话，商量哪个医生可能当班，爱迪应该给谁打电。虽然她就坐在他旁边的座位上，爱迪还是感到她的影子无处不在，在方向盘里，在油门里，在他眨眼的瞬间，在他清嗓子时发出的声音里。他的一举一动都是为了要挽留住她。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They parked in the lot and Eddie shut the engine. It was suddenly too still and too quiet. He heard every tiny sound, the squeak of his body on the leather seat, the ca-cunk of the door handle, the rush of outside air, his feet on the pavement, the jangle of his keys.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们把车泊在停车场里，爱迪熄了火。四周骤然变得过于凝滞，过于安静。他听得到每一个细小的声音，他的身体在皮车座上发出的咯吱声，车门把手喀哒一记打开的声音，外面的空气急速流过的声音，他的脚踩在停车场上的声音，他的钥匙串丁当作响的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He opened her door and helped her get out. Her shoulders were scrunched up near her jaws, like a freezing child. Her hair blew across her face. She sniffed and lifted her eyes to the horizon. She motioned to Eddie and nodded toward the distant top of a big, white amusement ride, with red carts dangling like tree ornaments.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他帮她打开车门，扶她出来。她的肩膀紧挨在下颚边蜷缩成一团，像一个冻僵了的孩子。她的头发被风吹得遮住了脸。她吸了吸鼻子，抬起眼睛，望着远处的地平线。她朝爱迪示意了一下，并朝那台白色大型游乐车顶部点了点头，游乐车上的红色车厢像挂在树上的装饰物一样摇来晃去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Because he had not slept in heaven, it was Eddie's perception that he had not spent more than a few hours with any of the people he'd met. Then again, without night or day, without sleeping or waking, without sunsets or high tides or meals or schedules, how did he know?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱迪来到天堂之后还没有睡过觉，所以，他觉得自己同每一个跟他见面的人待在一起的时间都不超过几个钟头。但是，没有白天也没有黑夜，没有睡眠也没有醒来，没有日落也没有潮涨，没有三餐也没有日程表，他怎么知道呢？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">With Marguerite, he wanted only time -- more and more time -- and he was granted it, nighttimes and daytimes and nighttimes again. They walked through the doors of the assorted weddings and spoke of everything he wished to speak about. At a Swedish ceremony, Eddie told her about his brother, Joe, who had died 10 years earlier from a heart attack, just a month after purchasing a new condominium in Florida. At a Russian ceremony, she asked if he had kept the old apartment, and he said that he had, and she said she was glad. At an outdoor ceremony in a Lebanese village, he spoke about what had happened to him here in heaven, and she seemed to listen and know at the same time. He spoke of the Blue Man and his story, why some die when others live, and he spoke about the Captain and his tale of sacrifice. When he spoke about his father, Marguerite recalled the many nights he had spent enraged at the man, confounded by his silence. Eddie told her he had made things square, and her eyebrows lifted and her lips spread and Eddie felt an old, warm feeling he had missed for years, the simple act of making his wife happy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="同玛格丽特在一起，他只需要时间－－越多越好－－他现在如愿以偿了。他们穿过一扇扇的门，见识各式各样的婚礼，他同她畅所欲言。在一场瑞典婚礼上，爱迪告诉她，他哥哥乔十年前死于心脏病，死前一个月刚刚在佛罗里达州买了一套新的高尚公寓。在一场俄国婚礼上，她问他是不是一直住在他们的老公寓里，他说是，她说她听了很高兴。在一个黎巴嫩村庄里举行的户外婚礼上，他讲起他到了天堂之后发生的事情，她似乎在听，又似乎已经知道。他讲到蓝皮人和他的故事，讲到为什么一些人死掉而另一些人活着，他讲到了上尉和他的关于自我牺牲的故事。当他讲到父亲的时候，玛格丽特回忆起曾有许多个夜晚，爱迪为了父亲的事火冒三丈，他捉摸不透父亲的冷漠。爱迪告诉她，现在他已经把事情摆平了，她扬起眉毛，咧开嘴笑了，爱迪又体会到了他多年来怀念的那种熟悉、温暖的感觉，那便是做一件能让他妻子开心的事。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At times, There in heaven, the two of them would lie down together. But they did not sleep. On earth, Marguerite said, when you fell asleep, you sometimes dreamed your heaven and those dreams helped to form it. But there was no reason for such dreams now.</div>
