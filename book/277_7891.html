<div class="line_en">"No red rose in all my garden!" he cried, and his beautiful eyes filled with tears. "Ah, on what little things does happiness depend!

<div class="line_en">"Here at last is a true lover," said the Nightingale. "Night after night have I sung of him, though I knew him not: night after night have I told his story to the stars and now I see him.

<div class="line_cn" title="“终于这儿有了真正的恋人，”夜莺说。“虽然我们并不认识，但是我整夜整夜的为他歌唱。我整夜整夜向星星讲述他的故事，如今我终于见到了他。他的头发乌黑的像绽放的风信子一样，他的嘴唇红的像他渴望的红玫瑰一样；但是感情让他的面孔苍白无力，忧伤的痕迹爬上他的眉梢。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The Prince gives a ball to-morrow night," murmured the young student, "and my love will be of the company. If I bring her a red rose she will dance with me till dawn.

But there is no red rose in my garden, so I shall sit lonely, and she will pass me by. She will have no heed of me, and my heart will break."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Here, indeed, is the true lover," said the Nightingale. "What I sing of, he suffers: what is joy to me, to him is pain. Surely love is a wonderful thing. It is more precious than emeralds (2), and dearer than fine opals (3). Pearls and pomegranates cannot buy it, nor is it set forth in the market-place. It may not be purchased of the merchants, nor can it be weighed out in the balance for gold."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这的确是真正的恋人，”夜莺说。“我唱的歌，诉说着他的遭遇，我所有的欢乐，确实他的痛苦。当然爱是件多么美好的事情。她比绿宝石还要珍贵，比最好的蛋白石还要稀奇。珍珠和石榴无法与她媲美，市场上绝不会出售。商人那里买不到，黄金也不能与她交换。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The musicians will sit in their gallery," said the young Student, "and play upon their stringed instruments, and my love will dance to the sound of the harp and the violin.

But with me she will not dance, for I have no red rose to give her:" and he flung himself down on the grass, and buried his face in his hands, and wept.</div>

In fact, she is like most artists; she is all style without any sincerity. She would not sacrifice herself for others. She thinks merely of music, and everybody knows that the arts are selfish. Still, it must be admitted that she has some beautiful notes in her voice. What a pity it is that they do not mean anything, or do any practical good!"

<div class="line_en">"Ungrateful!" said the girl. "I tell you what, you are very rude; and, after all, who are you? Only a Student. Why, I dont believe you have even got silver buckles to your shoes as the Chamberlain's nephew has;" and she got up from her chair and went into the house.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“爱情真是件愚蠢的事情！”学生边走边说。“它可远比不上逻辑学的用处，因为它无法证明任何事情，只不过告诉我们一些不会发生的事情，和让人相信事实皆为谎言。其实，这才是不切实际的，在这个年代一切都要讲实际。我还是回到哲学去，学那些形而上学的知识。”">查看中文翻译</div>
