<div class="line_en">They crossed the river in a sampan. A chair was waiting for Kitty at the landing-stage and she was carried up the hill to the water-gate. It was through this that the coolies came to fetch water from the river and they hurried to and fro with huge buckets hanging from the yoke on their shoulder, splashing the causeway so that it was as wet as though it had heavily rained. Kitty's bearers gave short, sharp cries to urge them to make way.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Of course all business is at a standstill," said Waddington, walking by her side. "Under normal circumstances you have to fight your way through the coolies carrying loads up and down to the junks."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“显而易见，很多生意都不做了。”韦丁顿说道。他并未坐轿，而是在她身边步行。“若在平时，这路上会有很多驮着货物到栈桥去的苦役跟你抢道。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The street was narrow and winding so that Kitty lost all sense of the direction in which she was going. Many of the shops were closed. She had grown used on the journey up to the untidiness of a Chinese street, but here was the litter of weeks, garbage and refuse; and the stench was so horrible that she had to put her handkerchief to her face. Passing through Chinese cities she had been incommoded by the staring of the crowd, but now she noticed that no more than an indifferent glance was thrown at her. The passers-by, scattered rather than as usual thronging, seemed intent on their own affairs. They were cowed and listless. Now and then as they went by a house they heard the beating of gongs and the shrill, sustained lament of unknown instruments. Behind those closed doors one was lying dead.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="城里的街道很窄，每一条都有许多弯儿，没过一会儿凯蒂就完全找不着方向了。很多商铺都是店门紧闭。来湄潭府的途中她早对中国城镇肮脏不堪的街道司空见惯了，但是这里的垃圾堆积如山，显然已经几个礼拜没人收拾过。从垃圾堆里散发出难闻的恶臭，吓得凯蒂赶紧用手帕捂住鼻子。以前她在中国城镇里经过，街上的人们少不了要盯着她瞧，然而现在只是偶尔有人朝她漠然地瞥上一眼。街上也不再是人山人海，只有三三两两的人走动。他们似乎都在专心干自己手头上的事儿，然而一个个都不声不响，没精打采。偶尔经过几处房子，会听见里面传出敲锣的声音，同时有不知是什么乐器奏着尖利、悠长的哀伤曲调。看来在那些紧紧关闭的房门后面，有人刚刚死去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The door was opened by a Chinese girl, and after a word or two from Waddington she led them into a little room on the side of the corridor. It contained a large table covered with a chequered oilcloth and round the walls was a set of stiff chairs. At one end of the room was a statue, in plaster, of the Blessed Virgin. In a moment a nun came in, short and plump, with a homely face, red cheeks and merry eyes. Waddington, introducing Kitty to her, called her Soeur St Joseph.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="门被一个中国女孩打开了，韦丁顿跟她说了两句话，她就把他们带到了走廊旁边的一个小屋子里。屋里摆着一张大桌子，桌上铺着一块画有跳棋棋盘图案的油布，靠墙摆放着一套木椅。屋子的尽头有一尊石膏雕成的圣母玛丽亚的塑像。过了一会儿，一个修女走了进来， 她身材矮胖，长了一张朴实无华的脸，脸蛋红扑扑的，眼神十分欢快。韦丁顿向她介绍了凯蒂。他管她叫圣约瑟姐妹。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Here we are," said Waddington at last.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们到了。”韦丁顿终于说道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"C'est la dame du docteur?" she asked, beaming, and then added that the Mother Superior would join them directly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是医生的夫人吗？”她热情地用法语问道，并说院长一会儿会直接过来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The chair was set down at a small doorway, surmounted by a cross, in a long white wall, and Kitty stepped out. He rang the bell.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="轿子在一扇小门前停了下来，门顶上镶嵌着一个十字架，两边是长长的白墙。凯蒂下了轿子，然后韦丁顿摇了摇门铃。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You mustn't expect anything very grand, you know. They're miserably poor."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你千万别盼着见到什么华丽的东西。你知道，她们可是穷得叮当响。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sister St Joseph could speak no English and Kitty's French was halting; but Waddington, fluent, voluble, and inaccurate, maintained a stream of facetious comment which convulsed the good-humoured nun. Her cheerful, easy laughter not a little astonished Kitty. She had an idea that the religious were always grave and this sweet and childlike merriment touched her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="圣约瑟姐妹不会讲英语，而凯蒂的法语也是磕磕绊绊，只有韦丁顿能流利地说一口并非十分地道的法语。他发表了一大通滑稽的评论，逗得这位生性欢快的修女捧腹大笑。她动辄开怀，且笑得如此由衷，着实令凯蒂吃了一惊。她原先以为僧侣一定都是庄严肃穆的人，而这位修女孩子般的欢乐劲儿不禁深深打动了她。">查看中文翻译</div>
