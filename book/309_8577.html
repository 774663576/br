<div class="line_en">The day of the announcement, Papa was lucky enough to have some work. On his way home, he picked up a discarded newspaper, and rather than stopping to shove it between paint cans in his cart, he folded it up and slipped it beneath his shirt. By the time he made it home and removed it, his sweat had drawn the ink onto his skin. The paper landed on the table, but the news was stapled to his chest. A tattoo. Holding the shirt open, he looked down in the unsure kitchen light.</div>

<div class="line_en">Nearly a month after school resumed, she was moved up to her rightful year level. You might think this was due to her improved reading, but it wasn't. Despite the advancement, she still read with great difficulty. Sentences were strewn everywhere. Words fooled her. The reason she was elevated had more to do with the fact that she became disruptive in the younger class. She answered questions directed to other children and called out. A few times, she was given what was known as a Watschen (pronounced "varchen") in the corridor.</div>

Every child was made to stand at the front of the room and read from a passage the teacher gave them. It was a frosty morning but bright with sun. Children scrunched their eyes.

<div class="line_en">"I don't believe this," the sister muttered. "It can't be," because sure enough, when Liesel stepped forward to show her hands, Ludwig Schmeikl was all over them, rusting by the moment. "The corridor," she stated for the second time that day. For the second time that hour, actually.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当莉泽尔走上前来伸出手时，玛丽亚修女低声抱怨道：“我简直不敢相信，这怎么可能。”莉泽尔的手上都是路德维希·施迈克尔的血迹，此时已经开始凝固了。“去走廊。”修女下令。这是今天她第二次挨罚了。准确地说，是一个小时内的第二次。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In fact, probably the only thing that stopped her was the twitchingly pathetic, grinning face of Tommy Muller. Still crowded with adrenaline, Liesel caught sight of him smiling with such absurdity that she dragged him down and started beating him up as well.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="真正让她停手的是汤米·穆勒那张不断抽搐的惨白的脸，他正咧着嘴大笑。肾上腺素还在莉泽尔体内狂奔，她看到汤米那副古怪的笑容，于是把他拖倒在地，也给了他一顿打。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was only when everyone moved back inside and Sister Maria saw the state of Ludwig Schmeikl that the fight resumed. First, it was Rudy and a few others who bore the brunt of suspicion. They were always at each other. "Hands," each boy was ordered, but every pair was clean.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但大家回到教室，玛丽亚修女看到路德维希·施迈克尔的惨状时，战火再度燃起。首先被怀疑的是鲁迪和其他几个孩子。他们总是吵来吵去。“手。”每个男孩都被勒令伸出手，但每一双手都是干干净净的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At the end of the school day, Liesel walked home with Rudy and the other Steiner children. Nearing Himmel Street, in a hurry of thoughts, a culmination of misery swept over her -- the failed recital of The Grave Digger's Handbook, the demolition of her family, her nightmares, the humiliation of the day -- and she crouched in the gutter and wept. It all led here.</div>

<div class="line_en">This time, it was not a small Watschen. It was not an average one. This time, it was the mother of all corridor Watschens, one sting of the stick after another, so that Liesel would barely be able to sit down for a week. And there was no laughter from the room. More the silent fear of listening in.</div>
