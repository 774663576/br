<div class="line_en">She laid down her palette and went into the bathroom to wash. The old man raised himself out of the armchair and reached for his cane, which was leaning against a table. The door of the studio led directly out to the lawn. It was growing dark. Fifty feet away was a white clapboard house. The ground-floor windows were lit. Sabina was moved by the two windows shining out into the dying day.</div>

<div class="line_en">All her life she had proclaimed kitsch her enemy. But hadn't she in fact been carrying it with her? Her kitsch was her image of home, all peace, quiet, and harmony, and ruled by a loving mother and wise father. It was an image that took shape within her after the death of her parents. The less her life resembled that sweetest of dreams, the more sensitive she was to its magic, and more than once she shed tears when the ungrateful daughter in a sentimental film embraced the neglected father as the windows of the happy family's house shone out into the dying day.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她说过，媚俗是自己一生的敌人，但是在她的内心深处难道就不媚俗吗？她的媚俗，就是看到宁静、温馨、和谐的家，家中母亲慈祥温柔，父亲充满智慧。父母去世后，她头脑中就生发了这一形象。由于她的生活经历与这一美丽的梦想相去甚远，于是对这一形象的魅力倍加敏感。每当在电视中，在感伤的影片中，看到薄情的少女紧紧地搂着遭遗弃的父亲，看到暮色苍茫中幸福人家的闪亮的窗户时，她不止一次地感到双眼被泪水打湿。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She had met the old man in New York. He was rich and liked paintings. He lived alone with his wife, also aging, in a house in the country. Facing the house, but still on his land, stood an old stable. He had had it remodeled into a studio for Sabina and would follow the movements of her brush for days on end.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她在纽约结识了这位老者。他富有，喜欢画，与同龄的妻子生活在一间乡间别墅。别墅的对面是一个旧马棚。他把它改成画室，邀请萨比娜来作画。此后，他整天呆在画室看萨比娜一笔笔地作画。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She was well aware it was an illusion. Her days with the aging couple were merely a brief interval. The old man was seriously ill, and when his wife was left on her own, she would go and live with their son in Canada. Sabina's path of betrayals would then continue elsewhere, and from the depths of her being, a silly mawkish song about two shining windows and the happy family living behind them would occasionally make its way into the unbearable lightness of being.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她清醒地知道，那不过是一种幻觉而已。这只不过是她在这对可爱的老人家中的一次短暂停留。老先生重病在身，如果他不在了，老妇人就会去加拿大的儿子家中。萨比娜又会重新踏上背叛之路，在她心灵最深处，在不能承受的生命之轻中，不时奏响那首荒谬但感伤的歌曲，向人诉说，在两扇闪亮的窗户后，生活着一个幸福的人家。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Had she then, herself on the threshold of old age, found the parents who had been snatched from her as a girl? Had she at last found the children she had never had herself?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在步入老龄之际，她难道终于又找回了年幼时就被夺去生命的父母吗？要不，虽终生未育，但此时她却拥有了自己的孩子？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now all three of them were having supper together. The old woman called Sabina my daughter, but all indications would lead one to believe the opposite, namely, that Sabina was the mother and that her two children doted on her, worshipped her, would do anything she asked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此刻，三人正在一起用晚餐，老妇人称萨比娜为“我可爱的女儿！”，但从表面看来，情况却恰恰相反：萨比娜坐在那里好似一个在与膝上两个孩子玩耍的母亲，他们崇拜她，只要她想要什么，他们时刻准备听从她的吩咐。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Though touched by the song, Sabina did not take her feeling seriously. She knew only too well that the song was a beautiful lie. As soon as kitsch is recognized for the lie it is, it moves into the context of non-kitsch, thus losing its authoritarian power and becoming as touching as any other human weakness. For none among us is superman enough to escape kitsch completely. No matter how we scorn it, kitsch is an integral part of the human condition.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这首歌令她感动，但她对自己的这份感动并不当真。她十分清楚，这首歌只不过是一个美丽的谎言。在媚俗被当作谎言的情况下，媚俗必定处于非媚俗的境地。媚俗一旦失去其专横的权力，它就像人类的任何一个弱点一样令人心动。因为我们中没有一个是超人，不可能完全摆脱媚俗。不管我们心中对它如何蔑视，媚俗总是人类境况的组成部分。">查看中文翻译</div>
