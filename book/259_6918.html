<div class="line_en">The "Nightline" show had done a follow-up story on Morrie partly because the reception for the first show had been so strong. This time, when the cameramen and producers came through the door, they already felt like family. And Koppel himself was noticeably warmer. There was no feeling out process, no interview before the interview.</div>

<div class="line_en">As warm-up, Koppel and Morrie exchanged stories about their childhood backgrounds: Koppel spoke of growing up in England, and Morrie spoke of growing up in the Bronx. Morrie wore a longsleeved blue shirt -- he was almost always chilly, even when it was ninety degrees outside -- but Koppel removed his jacket and did the interview in shirt and tie. It was as if Morrie were breaking him down, one layer at a time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="为了创造一点气氛，科佩尔和莫里聊了一会儿各自的童年生活。科佩尔谈到了他在英国的成长经历。莫里则叙述了他在布朗克斯区的童年生活。莫里穿了一件蓝色的长袖衬衫——他几乎一直感到冷，即使外面的气温高达华氏九十度——科佩尔也脱去了外衣，穿着衬衫和领带进行采访。看来莫里正潜移默化地在影响科佩尔。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Morrie sighed… "Nobody can know it but me, Ted. But I know it." And as he spoke, it became obvious. He was not waving his hands to make a point as freely as he had in their first conversation. He had trouble pronouncing certain words -- the L sound seemed to get caught in his throat. In a few more months, he might no longer speak at all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title='莫里叹了口气。"别人是不会知道的，特德，可我知道。"随着采访的继续，种种迹象便开始显露出来。他不再像第一次那样毫无困难地用手势来阐明一个观点；某些词语的发音也成了问题——L音似乎老卡在喉咙里。再过几个月，他也许再也不能说话了。'>查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"But there are days when I am depressed. Let me not deceive you. I see certain things going and I feel a sense of dread. What am I going to do without my hands? What happens when I can't speak? Swallowing, I don't care so much about -- so they feed me through a tube, so what? But my voice? My hands? They're such an essential part of me. I talk with my voice. I gesture with my hands. This is how I give to people."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title='"但我也有感到沮丧的时刻。我不想欺骗你们。我看见某些东西正在离我而去，便有一种恐惧感。我失去双手后将怎么办，我不能说话后又将怎么办，还有吞咽食物，对此我倒并不怎么在乎——他们可以用管子喂我。可我的声音？我的手？它们是我不可或缺的部分。我用声音说话，用手打手势。这是我与别人沟通的途径。"'>查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Here's how my emotions go," Morrie told Koppel. "When I have people and friends here, I'm very up. The loving relationships maintain me.</div>

<div class="line_en">He mentioned a dear friend Morrie had, Maurie Stein, who had first sent Morrie's aphorisms to the Boston Globe. They had been together at Brandeis since the early sixties. Now Stein was going deaf. Koppel imagined the two men together one day, one unable to speak, the other unable to hear. What would that be like?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他提到了莫里的好友毛里·斯但因，他是第一个把莫里的格言寄到《波士顿环球》杂志的。他们从六十年代早期就一直在布兰代斯大学共事。现在斯但因快要失聪了。科佩尔想象有一天让他们俩在一起，一个不能说话，一个没有听觉，那会是怎样的情形？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Morrie shrugged. "Maybe I'll have everyone ask me yes or no questions." It was such a simple answer that Koppel had to smile. He asked Morrie about silence.</div>

<div class="line_en">Before the show ended, Morrie read Koppel one of the letters he'd received. Since the first "Nightline" program, there had been a great deal of mail. One particular letter came from a schoolteacher in Pennsylvania who taught a special class of nine children; every child in the class had suffered the death of a parent.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title='采访快要结束时，莫里给科佩尔念了一封他收到的信。自从"夜线"节目播出后，莫里每天都收到大量的来信。其中有一封是宾夕法尼亚的一个教师寄来的，她在教一个只有九个学生的特殊班级，每个学生都经历了失去父亲或母亲的痛苦。'>查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Here's what I sent her back," Morrie told Koppel, perching his glasses gingerly on his nose and ears. "'Dear Barbara… I was very moved by your letter. I feel the work you have done with the children who have lost a parent is very important. I also lost a parent at an early age…'"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title='"这是我给她的回信，"莫里的手哆嗦着把眼镜架到鼻梁和耳朵上。"亲爱的芭芭拉？你的来信使我深受感动。我觉得你为那些失去了父亲或母亲的孩子所做的工作十分重要。我早年也失去了双亲中的一个？"'>查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Suddenly, with the cameras still humming, Morrie adjusted the glasses. He stopped, bit his lip, and began to choke up. Tears fell down his nose. "'I lost my mother when I was a child … and it was quite a blow to me… I wish I'd had a group like yours where I would have been able to talk about my sorrows. I would have joined your group because… "His voice cracked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title='突然，就在转动着的摄像机前，莫里在挪动眼镜。他止住了话语，咬着嘴唇，开始哽咽起来。泪水顺着鼻子流淌下来。"我还是个孩子时就失去了母亲？它对我的打击太大了？我真希望能像现在这样，对着你们倾诉出我的悲痛，我一定会加入到你们中间来，因为？"他泣不成声了。'>查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"We will hold hands," Morrie said. "And there'll be a lot of love passing between us. Ted, we've had thirty-five years of friendship. You don't need speech or hearing to feel that."</div>
