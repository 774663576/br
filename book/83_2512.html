<div class="line_en">I went over to the folded-back French window and looked at the small broken pane in the upper part of it. The bullet from Carmen's gun had smashed the glass like a blow. It had not made a hole. There was a small hole in the plaster which a keen eye would find quickly enough. I pulled the drapes over the broken pane and took Carmen's gun out of my pocket. It was a Banker's Special,.22 caliber, hollow point cartridges. It had a pearl grip, and a small round silver plate set into the butt was engraved: "Carmen from Owen." She made saps of all of them.</div>

<div class="line_en">"That's fine," I told him. I looked across at Agnes. She had finished fixing her face and was staring at the wall, blank-eyed, hardly listening. Her face had the drowsiness which strain and shock induce, after their first incidence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那很好。”我对他说。我看向那边的艾格尼丝。她已经把脸收拾干净，这时正眼神空洞地盯着墙壁，没怎么听我们的对话。一路过来，又是摸爬滚打又是担惊受怕，她已是一脸倦容。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The blonde opened her eyes and looked at him with vague but uncomplimentary speculation. "A half smart guy," she said with a tired sniff. "That's all I ever draw. Never once a guy that's smart all the way around the course. Never once."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那金发妞睁开眼睛，看着他。很难讲她眼里带着什么深意，反正不是好感。“聪明？只聪不明的家伙罢了。”说着她厌倦地“哼”了一声，“我早看透了。没有哪个家伙是从头至尾都聪明的。一个都没有。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Okey." I stood up and went over to the tall oak desk and took his two guns out of my pockets, laid them side by side on the blotter so that the barrels were exactly parallel. I reached my hat off the floor beside the davenport and started for the door.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Why not? This Buick was down back of Geiger's according to you. Well, Mrs. Regan didn't have it out. Her chauffeur, a lad named Owen Taylor, had it out. He went over to Geiger's place to have words with him, because Owen Taylor was sweet on Carmen, and he didn't like the kind of games Geiger was playing with her. He let himself in the back way with a jimmy and a gun and he caught Geiger taking a photo of Carmen without any clothes on. So his gun went off, as guns will, and Geiger fell down dead and Owen ran away, but not without the photo negative Geiger had just taken. So you ran after him and took the photo from him. How else would you have got hold of it?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“怎么不能？是你说的，那辆别克就停在盖革家后面。哎，开车出去的不是里根太太。是她的司机，一个名叫欧文·泰勒的小伙子开的车。他跑去那儿是要找盖革谈谈，因为欧文·泰勒很喜欢卡门，他不喜欢盖革跟卡门玩的把戏。他是走后门进屋的，身上带着撬棍和枪，进屋一看，盖革正在给卡门拍裸照。所以自然而然，他开枪了，盖革倒在了地上，逃跑时，欧文把盖革刚拍的照片的底片落下了。于是你追了上去，从他那儿弄到了照片。不然你还能怎么拿到照片？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Brody licked his lips. "Yeah," he said. "But that don't make me knock him off. Sure, I heard the shots and saw this killer come slamming down the back steps into the Buick and off. I took out after him. He hit the bottom of the canyon and went west on Sunset. Beyond Beverly Hills he skidded off the road and had to stop and I came up and played copper. He had a gun but his nerve was bad and I sapped him down. So I went through his clothes and found out who he was and I lifted the plateholder, just out of curiosity. I was wondering what it was all about and getting my neck wet when he came out of it all of a sudden and knocked me off the car. He was out of sight when I picked myself up. That's the last I saw of him."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布罗迪舔舔嘴唇。“是的，”他说，“但这并不能说明棍击他的人是我。没错，我听到了枪声，也看到了这凶手砰砰跑下楼梯，钻进别克车里逃走了。我跟了上去。他开到峡谷尽头，在日落大道向西驶去。过了贝弗利山，他滑出了路面只好停车，我便上前假扮警察。他有枪，但没胆量，被我唬得动都不敢动。我搜了他的身，知道了他的身份。我拿走底片，完全是因为好奇。我琢磨着那东西是用来干吗的，脖子都被雨淋湿了。这时他突然冲出来把我撞翻在地。等我爬起来时他已经不见了。自此我就没见过他。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He jumped his eyebrows. Then he grinned. "Nix, nix. Skip it. You think I'd go back there and handle him, not knowing when a couple carloads of law would come tearing around the corner? Nix."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他挑起了眉毛，咧嘴笑道：“不，不。没这回事。难道你觉得我会跑回去处理他的尸体？谁知道什么时候整车整车的警察就会呼啸而来。不可能的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Brody shrugged. "I figure it was, but I can be wrong. When I had the plate developed and saw what was on it, I was pretty damn sure. And when Geiger didn't come down to the store this morning and didn't answer his phone I was plenty sure. So I figure it's a good time to move his books out and make a quick touch on the Sternwoods for travel money and blow for a while."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布罗迪耸耸肩。“估计就是他，不过我也可能弄错。等我把底片冲印出来，看到拍的内容，我就确定了七八分了。等我知道今天早上盖革没来店里，也不接电话，我就十分确定了。于是我想是时候把他的书运走，赶紧找斯特恩伍德家敲笔旅行的钱，开溜一阵子。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I nodded. "That seems reasonable. Maybe you didn't murder anybody at that. Where did you hide Geiger's body?"</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="布罗迪耸耸肩。脸上还是笑嘻嘻的。他不信我的话。还没等他脸上的不信任逐渐散去，门铃又响了。布罗迪猛地蹿起来，目光锐利。他瞥了一眼桌上的枪。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Just about one," he growled. "I got enough of this puss in the corner game." He marched to the desk and took the Colt. He held it down at his side and went to the door. He put his left hand to the knob and twisted it and opened the door a foot and leaned into the opening, holding the gun tight against his thigh.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“差不多就这么一个，”他吼着，“我再也不想玩这种把人往墙角里逼的游戏了。”他健步走到桌前，拿起枪。他把枪贴紧身侧握着，往门口走去。他左手放在门把上，一转，把门打开了一英尺，身子探进门缝里，枪还是紧紧贴着大腿。">查看中文翻译</div>

He tilted forward against the door and the weight of his body pushed it shut with a bang. He slid down the wood. His feet pushed the carpet away behind him. His left hand dropped off the knob and the arm slapped the floor with a thud. His head was wedged against the door. He didn't move. The Colt clung to his right hand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布罗迪的回话我没听清。传来两声沉闷的枪响。枪口一定是牢牢压在布罗迪身上。他靠着门向前倾，随着一声巨响，门阖上了。他的双脚推开了身后的地毯。他的左手松开了门把，手臂嘭的一声甩在地板上。他的头顶着门。他一动不动。那把柯尔特死死握在他的右手里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A tall hatless figure in a leather jerkin was running diagonally across the street between the parked cars. The figure turned and flame spurted from it. Two heavy hammers hit the stucco wall beside me. The figure ran on, dodged between two cars, vanished.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一个没戴帽子、穿着紧身皮衣的人影正奔跑在停当的车辆间斜向穿过马路。那人影转过身来，朝我开枪。两颗子弹狠狠打中了我身旁的灰泥墙。人影又跑了起来，闪避进两辆车之间，消失了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I raced down the hall and heard thumping feet going down the tile steps and went down after the sound. At the lobby level the front door was closing itself quietly and running feet slapped the sidewalk outside. I made the door before it was shut, clawed it open again and charged out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我沿着走廊飞奔起来，分明听见重重的脚步踏在铺了瓷砖的台阶上，便循声追去。追到大厅那层，只见大门正轻轻地自动关上，外面的人行道上传来“砰砰”的脚步声。我赶在门闭紧前冲了上去，一把将它推开，向外猛跑。">查看中文翻译</div>

No other car started up on the other side of the street. I thought I heard steps, but I wasn't sure about that. I rode down the hill a block and a half, turned at the intersection and started back up. The sound of a muted whistling came to me faintly along the sidewalk. Then steps. I double parked and slid out between two cars and went down low. I took Carmen's little revolver out of my pocket.</div>
