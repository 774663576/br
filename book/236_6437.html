<div class="line_en">Godfrey was not very surprised to find that Dunstan had not come home after his day's hunting. Perhaps he was staying the night at a public house. But when Dunstan did not return home the next day, Godfrey began to worry about Wild-fire. He did not trust his brother, and wondered if Dunstan had gone away to spend the money on gambling. So he decided to go to look for him. On the road near Raveloe he met his neighbour, John Bryce, who had arranged to buy Wildfire from Dunstan.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="戈弗雷对于邓斯坦在狩猎的第二天没有回家来一点儿也不奇怪。他也许又在哪间酒馆呆了一夜。可第三天邓斯坦还没回来，戈弗雷开始有些为他的野火担心了。他信不过他的兄弟，怀疑邓斯坦是不是去把钱花在赌场上了。于是他决定去找邓斯坦，在离瑞福洛不远的路上他遇到了邻居约翰·布莱斯，那个想从邓斯坦那里买走野火的人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What do you mean, John?" replied Godfrey quickly. "No, he hasn't been home yet. What's happened to my horse?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"Worse than that," answered Bryce. "I'm afraid your horse is dead. We've only just found him. Your brother rode him to the hunt and the horse fell at a gate and broke his back. So you haven't seen Dunstan since yesterday?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"No, and he'd better not come home now!" replied Godfrey angrily. "How stupid I was to trust him with my horse!"</div>

<div class="line_en">Bryce said goodbye and rode away. Godfrey rode slowly back into Raveloe, thinking about what he would very soon have to do. There was no longer any escape. He must confess the whole truth to his father. For the rest of the day he planned what he would say. He would explain that he had lent Fowler's money to Dunstan, because Dunstan knew his secret. That would be the right moment to tell the Squire about his secret marriage to Molly. "But he'll be very angry!" thought Godfrey. "And when he's angry with people, he just wants to punish them! He won't listen or calm down! But perhaps he'll keep my se-cret -- he's so proud of the family name! And if he disinherited me, everyone would talk about it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布莱斯告别后骑马走了，戈弗雷边骑马慢慢向村里走，边想下面怎么办。没法再逃了，他必须向父亲承认一切。这一天剩下的时间他都在想该向父亲说些什么。他要向父亲解释因为邓斯坦知道他的秘密，所以他不得不把福勒还来的钱借给了邓斯坦，正好趁此机会告诉父亲自己和莫丽的秘密婚姻。“但他会很生气！”戈弗雷想，“他一定会惩罚惹他生气的人！他不会听我说，也不会平静下来！但也许他会保守我的秘密——他是那么珍视家族的荣誉！如果他取消我的继承权，每个人都会议论这件事。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Him?" said Godfrey bitterly. "Oh, he'll be all right. He'll never be hurt -- he only ever hurts other people! We'll hear of him soon enough, don't worry."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他？”戈弗雷苦涩地说，“他不会有事儿的。他永远不会受伤——他只会去伤别人！你放心，我们很快会听到他的消息。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When he went to bed that night, Godfrey thought he had decided what to say. But when he woke up in the morning, he could not see any reason to confess to the marriage. Why should he lose the chance of marrying Nancy? Why should he tell the whole truth now, when perhaps it was not necessary? No, it would be better to go on in the same way as before. Perhaps Dunstan would stay away for a while, and then there would be no need to tell his father about Molly. "But today I'll tell the Squire about the money,"he thought. "He'll have to know about that."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="晚上上床的时候，戈弗雷已经决定了怎么说，可早上起床时，他又怎么也找不到承认秘密婚姻的理由了。为什么要失去娶南茜的机会？真有必要现在就承认一切吗？不，像以前那样过更好。也许邓斯坦会在外面呆一段时间，那也就没必要对父亲讲莫丽的事了。“但今天我得对他讲钱的事，”他想，“他必须知道这件事。”">查看中文翻译</div>

I just feel sorry I can't pay you -- you see, sir, the truth is, I'm very sorry, Fowler did pay the money. He gave it to me, and I was stupid enough to let Dunstan have it. And he was going to sell Wildfire and then I was going to repay you the money."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“比腿断了更糟，”戈弗雷接着沮丧地说，“野火死了。不过我并不想让您给我买新马，我只是为不能还上您的钱而难过——您看，很抱歉，实际上福勒先生已经还了钱，他还给了我，而我太傻了，竟然把钱交给了邓斯坦，我必须再还给您，所以邓斯坦就去卖野火。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What! Has he broken a leg? I thought you could ride better than that! Well, you can't expect me to pay for a new horse. I'm very short of money at the moment. And I'm angry with Fowler -- he still hasn't paid me what he owes me. If he doesn't pay today, he'll go to prison!" the Squire's face was red, and he banged angrily on the table as he spoke.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“什么！它的腿摔断了？我还以为你会骑马呢！别指望我再给你买一匹新马，我这一阵没钱，我正在为福勒生气——他还没有还欠我的钱。今天再不还，我会让他进监狱！”乡绅涨红了脸，生气地拍着桌子说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Squire's face was purple now, and for a moment he could not speak. "You -- you let Dunstan have my money? Why did you give it to him? And why did he want it? Where's Dunstan now? He'll answer my questions, or leave this house! Go and fetch him at once!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="乡绅的脸已经变成了紫色，气得一时说不上话来。“你——你把我的钱给了邓斯坦？为什么给他？他为什么要钱？邓斯坦现在在哪儿？他必须回答我的问题，否则就滚出这幢房子！马上去给我找他！”">查看中文翻译</div>

"Well, sir," he said, trying to speak carelessly, "it was just a little business between Dunstan and me. You wouldn't be interested in it, you know."</div>

<div class="line_en">"How old are you now? Twenty-six?"asked the Squire angrily. "Old enough to look after your money and mine too! I've been much too generous to you boys, but I'm going to be harder on you all from now on. You've got a weak character, Godfrey, like your poor mother. I think you need a wife who knows what she wants, because you can't decide anything by yourself! When you were thinking of marrying Nancy Lammeter, I agreed, didn't I? Have you asked her or not? She hasn't refused to marry you, has she?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你多大了？ 26？”乡绅生气地问，“你已经足够大了，应该能照看你的钱和我的钱了！我以前对你们太宽容了，可从现在开始我会对你们严厉起来。你的性格太软弱了，戈弗雷，就像你那可怜的妈妈。我想你需要有个头脑清楚的老婆来帮帮你，你自己根本不会做任何决定！我不是同意你娶南茜·拉默特吗？有没有向她求婚？她没有拒绝你吧？”">查看中文翻译</div>
