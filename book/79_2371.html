<div class="line_en">Ullman stood five-five, and when he moved, it was with the prissy speed that seems to be the exclusive domain of all small plump men. The part in his hair was exact, and his dark suit was sober but comforting. I am a man you can bring your problems to, that suit said to the paying customer. To the hired help it spoke more curtly: This had better be good, you. There was a red carnation in the lapel, perhaps so that no one on the street would mistake Stuart Ullman for the local undertaker.</div>

<div class="line_en">No returning smile from Ullman. He slipped Jack's application back into the file. The file went into a drawer. The desk top was now completely bare except for a blotter, a telephone, a Tensor lamp, and an in/out basket. Both sides of the in/out were empty, too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="厄尔曼没有还以笑脸。他把杰克的求职书塞回文件夹，然后又把文件夹放入抽屉。现在，写字台上干干净净的，只剩下一本记事簿，一部电话，一盏腾思尔牌台灯和一个进出口两端都空空如也的文件篮。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ullman stood up and went to the file cabinet in the corner. "Step around the desk, if you will, Mr. Torrance. We'll look at the floor plans." He brought back five large sheets and set them down on the glossy walnut plain of the desk. Jack stood by his shoulder, very much aware of the scent of Ullman's cologne. All my men wear English Leather or they wear nothing at all came into his mind for no reason at all, and he had to clamp his tongue between his teeth to keep in a bray of laughter. Beyond the wall, faintly, came the sounds of the Overlook Hotel's kitchen, gearing down from lunch.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="厄尔曼站身起来，向墙角的文件柜走去。“托兰斯先生，请到写字台这边来。我们来看看饭店各层的平面图。”厄尔曼取回5大张图纸，将它们平放在光洁的胡桃木桌面上。杰克和他并肩站着，明显地闻到厄尔曼身上扑鼻的科隆香水味儿。我手下的人要么穿英国皮衣，要么什么都不穿。这句话毫无缘由地跳进了他脑子里，但他咬住嘴唇忍着没有笑出来。这时，屋外隐约传来了远望饭店厨房里准备午餐的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>

The Overlook has changed hands several times since World War II and it seems that each successive manager has put everything they don't want up in the attic. I want rattraps and poison bait sowed around in it. Some of the third-floor chambermaids say they have heard rustling noises.

<div class="line_en">"Watson will show you all that. The basement floor plan is on the boiler room wall." He frowned impressively, perhaps to show that as manager, he did not concern himself with such mundane aspects of the Overlook's operation as the boiler and the plumbing. "Might not be a bad idea to put some traps down there too. Just a minute…" He scrawled a note on a pad he took from his inner coat pocket (each sheet bore the legend From the Desk of Stuart Ullman in bold black script), tore it off, and dropped it into the out basket. It sat there looking lonesome. The pad disappeared back into Ullman's jacket pocket like the conclusion of a magician's trick. Now you see it, Jacky-boy, now you don't. This guy is a real heavyweight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“沃森会领你去看个仔细的。地下室平面图在锅炉房的墙壁上。”厄尔曼用力皱了皱眉，也许是为了表明，作为饭店经理，他不屑于关心诸如锅炉、管道这样的琐事。“也许在那儿放几副捕鼠夹倒不是坏主意。等一下…”他从衣服内袋掏出一个便笺簿（每页笺头都用黑体字印着：斯图亚特—厄尔曼办公室），草草写了一张便条，撕下来，丢进文件篮的出口端。便条躺在那里孤零零的。便笺簿转眼消失在厄尔曼的上衣口袋里，快得跟魔术师的收场把戏一样。瞧，杰克老弟，它在这儿，瞧，它又不见啦。这可不是个好对付的家伙。">查看中文翻译</div>

Albert Shockley is a powerful man with a large interest in the Overlook, which showed a profit this season for the first time in its history.

<div class="line_en">"I don't believe you care much for me, Mr. Torrance. I don't care. Certainly your feelings toward me play no part in my own belief that you are not right for the job. During the season that runs from May fifteenth to September thirtieth, the Overlook employs one hundred and ten people full-time; one for every room in the hotel, you might say. I don't think many of them like me and I suspect that some of them think I'm a bit of a bastard. They would be correct in their judgment of my character. I have to be a bit of a bastard to run this hotel in the manner it deserves." He looked at Jack for comment, and Jack flashed the PR smile again, large and insultingly toothy.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ullman said: "The Overlook was built in the years 1907 to 1909. The closest town is Sidewinder, forty miles east of here over roads that are closed from sometime in late October or November until sometime in April. A man named Robert Townley Watson built it, the grandfather of our present maintenance man. Vanderbilts have stayed here, and Rockefellers, and Astors, and Du Pouts. Four Presidents have stayed in the Presidential Suite. Wilson, Harding, Roosevelt, and Nixon."</div>

It stood vacant until the end of World War II, when it was purchased and completely renovated by Horace Derwent, millionaire inventor, pilot, film producer, and entrepreneur."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="厄尔曼皱了皱眉，但没理会杰克的嘟哝，继续讲他的。“事实证明，沃森先生无力经营这家饭店。1915年，他把它卖了。后来，1922年、1929年和1936年，饭店又三易其手。多年来饭店一直无人问津，直到二战结束，贺拉斯—德文特——腰缠万贯的发明家，飞行员，电影制片商和实业家——买下饭店并作了彻底的装修。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes. Everything he touched seemed to turn to gold… except the Overlook.

<div class="line_en">"I wouldn't doubt it," Jack said gravely. A roque court, a topiary full of hedge animals out front, what next? A life-sized Uncle Wiggly game behind the equipment shed?

It shortens the profit margin a great deal more than you might believe, Mr. Torrance. The winters are fantastically cruel.

To repair breakage as it occurs and to do repairs, so the elements can't get a foothold. To be constantly alert to any and every contingency. During our first winter I hired a family instead of a single man. There was a tragedy. A horrible tragedy." Ullman looked at Jack coolly and appraisingly.</div>

You were teaching English in a Vermont prep school. You lost your temper, I don't believe I need to be any more specific than that. But I do happen to believe that Grady's case has a bearing, and that is why I have brought the matter of your… uh, previous history into the conversation. During the winter of 1970--71, after we had refurbished the Overlook but before our first season, I hired this… this unfortunate named Delbert Grady. He moved into the quarters you and your wife and son will be sharing. He had a wife and two daughters. I had reservations, the main ones being the harshness of the winter season and the fact that the Gradys would be cut off from the outside world for five to six months."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，肖克利先生跟我说过你戒酒了。他还谈到过你的最后后一份工作…你的最后一个可信赖的职业，可以这样说吗？你在佛蒙特一所预备学校教英语。你发了脾气，我想不必细说了。但我确实相信格雷迪事件具有某种教训意义，这就是我为什么提起你…呃，你从前的事的原因。1970－71年的那个冬天，我们将饭店修葺一新之后第一个营业季节之前的那个冬天，我雇用了这个…这个叫德尔伯特—格雷迪的倒霉鬼。他搬进了你太太和你儿子要住的那套房间，带着他妻子和两个女儿。我很不放心，主要原因是这儿的冬季太艰苦，而且格雷迪一家得与外界隔绝达五六个月之久。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"But that's not really true, is it? There are telephones here, and probably a citizen's band radio as well. And the Rocky Mountain National Park is within helicopter range and surely a piece of ground that big must have a chopper or two."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“但实际情况并非如此，是吗？这里有电话，也许还有一部民用电台。落基山国家公园就在直升机活动之内，这么大一片地方肯定会有一两架直升机。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I wouldn't know about that," Ullman said. "The hotel does have a two-way radio that Mr. Watson will show you, along with a list of the correct frequencies to broadcast on if you need help. The telephone lines between here and Sidewinder are still aboveground, and they go down almost every winter at some point or other and are apt to stay down for three weeks to a month and a half. There is a snowmobile in the equipment shed also."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我对这方面的情况不太清楚。”厄尔曼说，“饭店确实有一部双向电台，沃森会领你去看的，还有一张频率表供你需要时使用。这里到塞德温得的电话线还架在地面上，每年冬天不是这里就是那里断线，常常一断就是一两个月。对了，工具棚里还有一辆雪地车。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mr. Ullman looked pained. "Suppose your son or your wife tripped on the stairs and fractured his or her skull, Mr. Torrance. Would you think the place was cut off then?" Jack saw the point. A snowmobile running at top speed could get you down to Sidewinder in an hour and a half… maybe. A helicopter from the Parks Rescue Service could get up here in three hours… under optimum conditions. In a blizzard it would never even be able to lift off and you couldn't hope to run a snowmobile at top speed, even if you dared take a seriously injured person out into temperatures that might be twenty-five below -- or forty-five below, if you added in the wind chill factor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="厄尔曼先生露出一副痛苦的样子，说：“托兰斯先生，假如你儿子或者你太太在楼梯上摔破了颅骨，你还会认为这里并非与世隔绝吗？”杰克明白了他的意思。全速行驶的雪地车开往塞德温得要用一个半小时…也许。国家公园援救中心的直升机赶到这里需要三个小时…在最乐观的情况下。如果遇上暴风雪，直升机根本无法起飞，即使你敢冒险在华氏零下25度——或零下45度的风雪中把重伤病人带出门，也不可能指望雪地车能全速行驶。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"In the case of Grady," Ullman said, "I reasoned much as Mr. Shockley seems to have done in your case. Solitude can be damaging in itself. Better for the man to have his family with him. If there was trouble, I thought, the odds were very high that it would be something less urgent than a fractured skull or an accident with one of the power tools or some sort of convulsion. A serious case of the flu, pneumonia, a broken arm, even appendicitis. Any of those things would have left enough time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我也曾像肖克利极力保荐你那样为格雷迪说好话。”厄尔曼说，“孤独本身就是个刽子手。最好让他有家人相陪。当时我想，真要出什么麻烦的话，很可能不会像摔破颅骨、触电或昏迷那样紧急。重感冒、肺炎、摔断胳膊，甚至阑尾炎，这些问题都有足够的时间来对付。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I suspect that what happened came as a result of too much cheap whiskey, of which Grady had laid in a generous supply, unbeknownst to me, and a curious condition which the old-timers call cabin fever. Do you know the term?" Ullman offered a patronizing little smile, ready to explain as soon as Jack admitted his ignorance, and Jack was happy to respond quickly and crisply.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我怀疑惨剧是廉价威士忌造成的，格雷迪存了不少，事后我才知道。另一个原因是老辈人称为隔离热的一种怪病。明白这个术语吗？”厄尔曼对杰克居高临下地一笑，只等他承认自己的无知，随时准备提供解释，可杰克十分得意，他能作出干净利落的回答。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's a slang term for the claustrophobic reaction that can occur when people are shut in together over long periods of time. The feeling of claustrophobia is externalized as dislike for the people you happen to be shut in with. In extreme cases it can result in hallucinations and violence-murder has been done over such minor things as a burned meal or an argument about whose turn it is to do the dishes."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“隔离热是幽闭恐怖症的俗称，人们长期被关闭在一起就有可能得这种病。这种病症外在表现为讨厌关在一起的同伴。在极端情况下，病人会产生幻觉，甚至行凶杀人——原因常常是一些微不足道的小事，如饭烧糊了、该谁刷碗等等。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“他把她们全杀了，然后自杀了。他用斧子砍死了两个女儿，用猎枪打死了他妻子和他自己。他有一条腿断了，毫无疑问是酒后在楼梯上摔折的。”厄尔曼摊了摊手，盯着杰克，做出一副问心无愧的样子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"That was your mistake," Jack said. "A stupid man is more prone to cabin fever just as he's more prone to shoot someone over a card game or commit a spur-of-the-moment robbery. He gets bored. When the snow comes, there's nothing to do but watch TV or play solitaire and cheat when he can't get all the aces out. Nothing to do but bitch at his wife and nag at the kids and drink. It gets hard to sleep because there's nothing to hear. So he drinks himself to sleep and wakes up with a hangover. He gets edgy. And maybe the telephone goes out and the TV aerial blows down and there's nothing to do but think and cheat at solitaire and get edgier and edgier. Finally… boom, boom, boom."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这就是你的错了，”杰克说。“愚蠢的人更容易患幽闭恐怖症，正如他更易于为了一局扑克牌的输赢就杀人、仅凭心血来潮就去抢劫一样。他心里很厌烦。下雪后，他无所事事，只能看看电视、玩玩单人纸牌，玩得又不精，只好聊以自欺。百无聊赖的时候就责骂老婆，训斥孩子，酗酒。周围太清静，他睡不着觉，只好借助酒精使自己入睡，醒来后脑袋昏昏沉沉的。他心情越来越烦躁。也许恰好这时电话线又断了，电视天线也被风刮倒了，除了胡思乱想和玩单人纸牌戏外，再也无事可做。他越来越烦躁，越来越烦躁，最后…砰，砰，砰！”">查看中文翻译</div>

I plan to teach him to read, and I also want to teach him to snowshoe. Wendy would like to learn how, too. Oh yes, I think we can keep busy and out of each other's hair if the TV goes on the fritz." He paused. "And Al was telling the truth when he told you I no longer drink. I did once, and it got to be serious. But I haven't had so much as a glass of beer in the last fourteen months.
