<div class="line_en">Silas had been preoccupied for the previous several months. He had begun to leave the graveyard for days, sometimes weeks, at a time. Over Christmas, Miss Lupescu had come out for three weeks in his place, and Bod had shared her meals in her little flat in the Old Town. She had even taken him to a football match, as Silas had promised that she would, but she had gone back to the place she called "The Old Country" after squeezing Bod's cheeks and calling him Nimini, which had become her pet name for him.</div>

She hated her mother for moving away from Scotland, hated her father because he didn't seem to care that she had gone. She hated this town for being so different -- nothing like Glasgow, where she had grown up -- and she hated it because every now and again she would turn a corner and see something and the world would all become achingly, horribly familiar.</div>

<div class="line_en">She had lost it with her mother that morning. "At least in Glasgow I had friends!" Scarlett had said, and she wasn't quite shouting and she wasn't quite sobbing. "I'll never see them again!" All her mother had said in reply was, "At least you're somewhere you've been before. I mean, we lived here when you were little."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这天早晨，她忍无可忍地对母亲说：“至少在格拉斯哥我还有朋友！”她没有大喊大叫，也没有一把鼻涕一把泪，“我再也见不到他们了！”她母亲只回应道：“至少你在这儿生活过，我是说，你小时候在这儿住过。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Every day, when school was over, the 97 bus to the City Center would take her from her school gates all the way to the end of the street where her mother had rented a small flat. She had waited at the bus-stop on that gusty April day for almost half an hour and no 97 buses had appeared, so when she saw a 121 bus with City Center as its destination she had climbed aboard. But where her bus always turned right, this one turned left, into the Old Town, past the municipal gardens in the Old Town square, past the statue of Josiah Worthington, Bart., and then crept up a winding hill lined with high houses, as Scarlett's heart sank and her anger was replaced with misery.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Eventually. But even when you get there, you'll still need to get back." The woman sighed. "Best thing you can do, get off here, walk back down the hill, there's a bus-stop in front of the town hall.

It wouldn't be the first and it wouldn't be the last.</div>

<div class="line_en">A magpie flew up as she walked in, a flash of black and white and iridescent green, and settled in the branches of a yew tree, watching her. Around that corner, she thought, is a church, with a bench in front of it, and she turned a corner to see a church -- much smaller than the one in her head, a sinister blocky little Gothic building of grey stone, with a jutting spire. In front of it was a weathered wooden bench. She walked over, sat down on the bench, and swung her legs as if she was still a little girl.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当她走入时，一只乌鸦飞了起来，闪过一道黑色、白色与荧光闪闪的绿色交织的光芒，接着落在一棵紫杉树上，盯着她的一举一动。“转过拐角有座教堂，教堂前有一张长凳。”斯卡莉特一边默念，一边转过拐角，真的有一个教堂，但比她印象中小得多：一座由灰色石头砌成的哥特式建筑，上有尖顶，墙面斑驳，叫人瘆得慌。教堂前有一张久经日晒雨淋的木质长凳。她走到长凳前坐下，晃动双腿，仿佛她还是个小女孩。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There's an expression, déja vu, that means that you feel like you've been somewhere before, that you've somehow already dreamed it or experienced it in your mind.

This was different. This wasn't a feeling that she had been here before. This was the real thing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有这么个说法——似曾相识，意思是你感觉你曾经来过这个地方，或是梦见过，或是神游过。斯卡莉特有过这样的体验，比如预感到老师马上要讲她去延文尼斯度过假，或预感到有人的汤勺即将掉落。可这次不一样。这种感觉不是似曾相识，而是她真的来过这里。">查看中文翻译</div>

And the answer is, as far as I can ascertain, that on this site there was indeed a small church, and the original graveyard would have been its churchyard. That's as long ago as eight, perhaps nine hundred A. D. Rebuilt and extended several times in there. But there was a fire here in the 1820s and by that time it was already much too small for the area. People around here were using St. Dunstan's in the village square as their parish church, so when they came to rebuild here, they made it a funeral chapel, keeping many of the original features -- the stained glass windows in the far wall are said to be original…"</div>

It felt like that: the earth juddered, and Mr. Dandy fell, would have fallen into the darkness, but he caught hold of the fallen headstone, threw his arms about it and locked on. He did not know what was beneath him, only that he had no wish to find out.</div>

<div class="line_en">He could not find the boy by scent. Not here. The boy smelled like the graveyard. But the girl smelled like her mother's house, like the dab of perfume she had touched to her neck before school that morning.

<div class="line_en">"Scarlett," he called, trying to remember how he would have called her name when he was Mr. Frost, but he could not even find that part of himself any longer: he was the man Jack now, and that was all he was. On his hands and knees he crawled through the hole in the wall.</div>

<div class="line_en">She had not thought anyone human could move that silently through the dark, but a gloved hand closed upon her mouth, and a voice that was only barely recognizable as Mr. Frost's said, without emotion, "Do anything clever -- do anything at all -- and I will cut your throat. Nod if you understand me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可她没有料想到，居然有人能在黑暗中悄无声息地前行。一只戴着手套的手捂住了她的嘴，一个冷漠无情的声音随之响起——她几乎没听出这是弗洛斯特先生的声音：“你要是敢耍花招，敢动一下，我就割断你的脖子。听懂了就点头。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She thought, I wonder what Mum's thinking right now. She'll be phoning Mr. Frost's house over and over to find out when I'm going to get back.
