<div class="line_en">The first man told his story. He and his son were coming home from a long day's fishing. It was a dark night, and on the beach they had fallen over the dead body of a man. They had carried the body to the nearest house, and found that it was a good-looking young man about twenty-five years old. There were the marks of fingers round his neck. When they spoke of the marks of fingers, I remembered the murder of my brother and I felt a terrible fear.</div>

<div class="line_en">The son then told his story. He had seen a boat with a man in it, not far from the beach. He thought it was my boat. A woman had also seen a man in a boat sailing away from the beach. She thought I was the man.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="之后，那个儿子讲起了他的故事。他曾在离海岸不远的地方看到过上边有一个男人的一只船。他认为那是我的船。一个女人也曾看到有个男人驾着一只船朝海里划去。她认为我就是那个人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The judge was an old, kind man, but his face was very serious as he looked at me. He asked a number of men to tell me what they had seen and found the night before.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then I was taken to the room where the dead body lay. How can I tell you what I felt when I saw the body? I put my arms round it and cried: "What have I done? My friend! My dear friend!" The body was Henry Clerval's, and so now I had destroyed another person.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后我被带到尸体停放的那个房间。我该怎么形容我看到那具尸体时的感觉呢？我抱住尸体哭道：“我都干了什么啦？我的朋友！我亲爱的朋友！”那是亨利·克勒沃的尸体，这样我又毁了另一个人的生命。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This third death was too much for me. I fell down in a kind of madness, and they had to carry me from the room. For two months I was very ill and wished only to die. But slowly my madness left me, and my health began to return. At last I was able to speak to Judge Kerwin, and I asked for news of my family.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这第三起死亡事件对我打击太大了。我近乎疯狂地倒在了地上，他们不得不把我从房间里抬走。我大病了两个月的时间，一心只想去死。但渐渐地我不再疯狂，身体也开始恢复了。最后我可以同克文法官谈话并问起我家人的情况。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">My father looked after me on the long journey home, and sat with me for every minute. Night after night while I was asleep, I shouted that I was the murderer of William, Justine, and Henry. My father asked me why I said these awful things. I wanted to answer his question, but I could not tell him my terrible secret. He thought that I was still a little mad.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我父亲在回家的漫长旅途中一直照顾着我，每时每刻都坐在我的身边。一个个晚上，我在熟睡时都大声说我是杀害威廉、贾斯汀和亨利的凶手。我父亲问我为什么说出这些可怕的话。我想要回答他的问题，但又不能告诉他我那可怕的秘密。他认为我的大脑仍有些不正常。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For the first time since Henry's death I felt some happiness. I held out my hands to my father as he came into the room, and he took me in his arms. He gave me the good news that Elizabeth and Ernest were safe and well.</div>

<div class="line_en">We arrived in Geneva soon after my letter had reached Elizabeth. It was wonderful to see her again. She ran into my arms and I held her close.
