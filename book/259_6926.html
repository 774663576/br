<div class="line_en">For my old professor, it was not the talk of being sick but the being sick itself that was sinking him. Since my last visit, a nurse had inserted a catheter into his penis, which drew the urine out through a tube and into a bag that sat at the foot of his chair. His legs needed constant tending (he could still feel pain, even though he could not move them, another one of ALS's cruel little ironies), and unless his feet dangled just the right number of inches off the foam pads, it felt as if someone were poking him with a fork. In the middle of conversations, Morrie would have to ask visitors to lift his foot and move it just an inch, or to adjust his head so that it fit more easily into the palm of the colored pillows. Can you imagine being unable to move your own head?</div>

<div class="line_en">The leaves had begun to change color, turning the ride through West Newton into a portrait of gold and rust. Back in Detroit, the labor war had stagnated, with each side accusing the other of failing to communicate. The stories on the TV news were just as depressing. In rural Kentucky, three men threw pieces of a tombstone off a bridge, smashing the windshield of a passing car, killing a teenage girl who was traveling with her family on a religious pilgrimage. In California, the O. J. Simpson trial was heading toward a conclusion, and the whole country seemed to be obsessed. Even in airports, there were hanging TV sets tuned to CNN so that you could get an O. J. update as you made your way to a gate.</div>

<div class="line_en">Morrie motioned for my hand, and as I gave it to him, I felt a surge of guilt. Here was a man who, if he wanted, could spend every waking moment in self-pity, feeling his body for decay, counting his breaths. So many people with far smaller problems are so self-absorbed, their eyes glaze over if you speak for more than thirty seconds. They already have something else in mind -- a friend to call, a fax to send, a lover they're daydreaming about. They only snap back to full attention when you finish talking, at which point they say "Uh-huh" or "Yeah, really" and fake their way back to the moment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title='莫里示意我把手伸给他，当我这么做的时候，我心中不禁涌起了一股愧意。坐在我面前的是一个有理由去哀叹自己的痛苦和不幸的老人；只要他想这么做，他可以用醒来后的每一分钟去触摸他日益枯谢的躯体，去计算他呼吸的频率。然而，有那么多人仅仅为了一些琐事而如此的自我专注，他们的眼光只停留在你身上三十秒钟便游离开去。他们早已驰心旁骛—— 给某个朋友打电话，给某个地方发传真，或跟某个情人约次会。只有当你的话说完时，他们才猛地回过神来，和你"嗯嗯啊啊"、"是的是的"地敷衍几句。'>查看中文翻译</div>

Those who sat with him saw his eyes go moist when they spoke about something horrible, or crinkle in delight when they told him a really bad joke. He was always ready to openly display the emotion so often missing from my baby boomer generation. We are great at small talk: "What do you do?" "Where do you live?" But really listening to someone -- without trying to sell them something, pick them up, recruit them, or get some kind of status in return -- how often do we get this anymore? I believe many visitors in the last few months of Morrie's life were drawn not because of the attention they wanted to pay to him but because of the attention he paid to them. Despite his personal pain and decay, this little old man listened the way they always wanted someone to listen.</div>

<div class="line_en">The last time Morrie saw his own father was in a city morgue. Charlie Schwartz was a quiet man who liked to read his newspaper, alone, under a streetlamp on Tremont Avenue in the Bronx. Every night, when Morrie was little, Charlie would go for a walk after dinner. He was a small Russian man, with a ruddy complexion and a full head of grayish hair. Morrie and his brother, David, would look out the window and see him leaning against the lamppost, and Morrie wished he would come inside and talk to them, but he rarely did. Nor did he tuck them in, nor kiss them good-night.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莫里最后一次见到他父亲是在一家市停尸所。查理·施瓦茨生性寡言，他喜欢一个人在布朗克斯区特里蒙德街的路灯下看报。莫里小的时候，查理每天晚饭后便出去散步。他是个小个子的俄罗斯人，面色红润，满满一头浅灰的鬈发。莫里和弟弟大卫从窗口望着靠在路灯柱上的父亲，奠里很希望他能进屋来和他们说说话，但他很少这么做。他也从不替兄弟俩掖被子，吻他们道晚安。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In the South American rain forest, there is a tribe called the Desana, who see the world as a fixed quantity of energy that flows between all creatures. Every birth must therefore engender a death, and every death bring forth another birth. This way, the energy of the world remains complete.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在南美的热带雨林中，有一个名叫迪萨那的部落，他们认为世界是个恒定的能量体，它在万物中流动。因此，一个生命的诞生就招致了另一个生命的终结，同样，每一个死亡也带来了另一个生命。世界的能量就这样保持着平衡。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When the final moment came, Morrie wanted his loved ones around him, knowing what was happening. No one would get a phone call, or a telegram, or have to look through a glass window in some cold and foreign basement.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当最后的时刻到来时，莫里会让所有他爱的人围在他的身边，亲眼看见发生的一切。没人会接到电话，或接到电报，或在某个既冷又陌生的地下室里隔着玻璃看他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's only fair," he says.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title='"这很公平，"他说。'>查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When they hunt for food, the Desana know that the animals they kill will leave a hole in the spiritual well. But that hole will be filled, they believe, by the souls of the Desana hunters when they die. Were there no men dying, there would be no birds orfish being born. I like this idea. Morrie likes it, too. The closer he gets to good-bye, the more he seems to feel we are all creatures in the same forest. What we take, we must replenish.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当他们外出狩猎时，迪萨那人知道他们杀死的动物会在灵魂井里留下一个洞穴，这个洞穴将由死去的迪萨那猎手的灵魂去填补。如果没有人死去，就不会有鸟和鱼的诞生。我很赞同这个说法。莫里也很赞同。越接近告别的日子，他似乎越感到我们都是同一座森林里的生物。我们获取多少，就得补偿多少。">查看中文翻译</div>
