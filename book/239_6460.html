<div class="line_en">Alice carefully took out the brush and pinned up the Queen's hair more tidily. "There, you look better now," she said. "But really you should have a lady's maid."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱丽丝小心地拿出了梳子，把王后的头发更整齐地别起来。“这样看起来就好多了。说真的，你应该有一个侍女。”她说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"But it can't go straight, you know, if you pin it all on one side," Alice said, as she gently put it right for her. "And I'm afraid your hair is terribly untidy."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你如果把披肩别在一边，它就不可能挺直，这你也清楚。”爱丽丝说着就轻轻地把披肩给她披好。“恐怕你头发也太乱了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="王后答道：“是的。”同时徒然地拉了拉披肩，“天哪！我不明白今天我的披肩是怎么回事。我想它在生我的气。我把它别在这儿，又别到那儿，但它就是不满意。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我不要你来雇我。再说我也不喜欢吃果酱。”爱丽丝说完，笑了起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That's because we live backwards here," explained the Queen kindly. "It's always a little difficult at first."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那是因为在这儿我们往后过日子。要理解这一点起初总是困难的。”王后很友善地解释道。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="王后说：“那可没有好处。我可以记住两周后发生的事情。譬如说，国王的信使现在坐牢了，但他至今还没有做错什么事。他犯罪的时间要晚得多。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh, much better!" cried the Queen, her voice getting higher and higher as she went on. "Much better! Be-e-e-ter! Be-e-eh!" The last word sounded very like the sound that a sheep makes, and Alice looked at the Queen in surprise.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“噢，好多了！”王后高叫道，她不停地叫着，声音越来越高：“好多——了！好——多——了！好——！”最后一个词听起来就像绵羊在叫唤，爱丽丝不禁惊奇地看了看王后。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And indeed, the Queen was now covered in a thick woolly coat, and… Alice closed her eyes, then opened them again. She couldn't understand what had happened at all. The wood had disappeared, and she was in a little dark shop-and it re-ally was a sheep in front of her, wearing large glasses and sit-ting calmly on a chair, knitting.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一点不假，王后现在身披着一件厚厚的毛外衣。爱丽丝闭上眼睛，然后又睁开。她真的弄不明白到底是怎么回事。树林消失了，她在一家昏暗的小商店里——而且在她面前确实是一只绵羊，戴着大眼镜，静静地坐在椅子上织毛活。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm not sure at the moment," Alice said gently. "May I look round first?"</div>

<div class="line_en">She began to walk round the shop, looking at everything. But every time she looked hard at something, it seemed to move and then appear again a moment later in a different place. So it was difficult to see clearly what was there. She went on walking, and soon realized that the shop was much bigger than she had thought.</div>

<div class="line_en">"To buy!" Alice said, jumping a little in surprise. The lake had gone, and she was back in the little dark shop. The Sheep was still knitting, and was looking at her crossly over the top of her glasses.</div>
