<div class="line_en">A word to fathers. Don't frighten away daughter's friend. Maybe it is a bit hard for you to realize that now the boys are finding her attractive. To you she is still a little girl. To the boys she's charming and fun, lovely and gay. They like her. Today you clinch big deals in an executive's office, but yesterday you were just highschool Jim carrying Jane's school books. Remember? Don't you want your daughter, now that her turn has come, to be happy in the admiration and company of boys she likes? Don't you want them to have wholesome fun together?</div>

<div class="line_en">First of all the old ogre drew up a list under "absolutely forbidden" and another under "reluctantly allowed." Absolutely forbidden were dates, single or double or triple -- the next step being of course mass orgy. She might visit a candy bar with her girl friends, and there giggle-chat with occasional young males, while I waited in the car at a discreet distance; and I promised her that if her group were invited by a socially acceptable group in Butler's Academy for Boys for their annual ball (heavily chaperoned, of course), I might consider the question whether a girl of fourteen can don her first "formal" (a kind of gown that makes thin-armed teen-agers look like flamingoes). Moreover, I promised her to throw a party at our house to which she would be allowed to invite her prettier girl friends and the nicer boys she would have met by that time at the Butler dance. But I was quite positive that as long as my regime lasted she would never, never be permitted to go with a youngster in rut to a movie, or neck in a car, or go to boy-girl parties at the houses of schoolmates, or indulge out of my earshot in boy-girl telephone conversations, even if "only discussing his relations with a friend of mine."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最初，食人老妖写了两张题为“完全禁止”和“勉强允许”的表。完全禁止的是单人或双人或三人约会——下一步当然就是大规模的狂欢作乐。她可以和女友逛糖果店，和偶然相遇的年轻男士咯咯说笑，而我则小心翼翼隔开一段距离在车内等候；我还保证如果被社会承认的巴特勒男子研究所邀请她的小组参加他们一年一度的舞会（当然会是女伴稠密），我会考虑一下十四岁的女孩子是否可以穿她首次亮相的“夜礼服”（一种使细胳膊少女看上去象红鹤一样的长袍）。另外，我还答应她在我们家举办一次舞会，她可以邀请她那些比较漂亮的女朋友和在巴特勒舞会上认识的比较优雅的男孩子。只是有一条，只要我的政权在握，就永远，永远不会允许她和春情萌发的年轻人去看电影，或在小汽车里卿卿我我，或到同学家参加男女混杂的舞会，或在我听力所及之外没完没了地进行男女电话交谈，既使“只是谈谈他和我的一位朋友的关系”。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Lo was enraged by all this -- called me a lousy crook and worse -- and I would probably have lost my temper had I not soon discovered, to my sweetest relief, that what really angered her was my depriving her not of a specific satisfaction but of a general right. I was impinging, you see, on the conventional program, the stock pastimes, the "things that are done," the routine of youth; for there is nothing more conservative than a child, especially a girl-child, be she the most auburn and russet, the most mythopoeic nymphet in October's orchard-haze.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="洛对这一切义愤填鹰——她称我是卑鄙恶棍，甚至更糟——若不是我很快发现真正让她生气的不是我剥夺了她的哪一种享乐而是普遍权利，这令我暗自感到宽慰，不然我一定要雷霆万钧。你看，我侵犯了已经协定的项目，普通的消遣，“完全正当”的事情以及年轻人的常规；可是，最该谨慎的莫过于一个孩子，特别是一个女孩子，象十月果园阴雾里她那样的一个肤色最为赤褐，最具有神话特征的性感少女。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Do not misunderstand me. I cannot be absolutely certain that in the course of the winter she did not manage to have, in a casual way, improper contacts with unknown young fellows; of course, no matter how closely I controlled her leisure, there would constantly occur unaccounted-for time leaks with over-elaborate explanations to stop them up in retrospect; of course, my jealousy would constantly catch its jagged claw in the fine fabrics of nymphet falsity; but I did definitely feel -- and can now vouchsafe for the accuracy of my feeling -- that there was no reason for serious alarm. I felt that way not because I never once discovered any palpable hard young throat to crush among the masculine mutes that flickered somewhere in the background; but because it was to me "overwhelmingly obvious" (a favorite expression with my aunt Sybil) that all varieties of high school boys -- from the perspiring nincompoop whom "holding hands" thrills, to the self-sufficient rapist with pustules and a souped-up car -- equally bored my sophisticated young mistress. "All this noise about boys gags me," she had scrawled on the inside of a schoolbook, and underneath, in Mona's hand (Mona is due any minute now), there was the sly quip: "What about Rigger?" (due too).</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不要误解我。我不能绝对肯定整个冬天，她未找机会随便和陌生小伙子有过不正常的接触；当然，不管我多么严密控制她的闲暇，总有无法圆说的时间漏洞，她一回忆起来就总要用极复杂的解释去堵塞，当然，我的嫉妒不整齐的爪子也总能抓住这性感少女虚假的纹理；但我确实感觉到——现在证明我的感觉的准确性——根本没有发出严重警告的理由。我这么想，并非因为我从未发现一个涩硬的少年喉音向同性的哑巴调情；而是因为我“太清楚”（我的西比尔姨妈的常用词），各种各样的中学男生———从汗流满面、“拉拉手”便激动的傻小子，到满脸浓疤、常备辆加马力小汽车的自我满足型强奸犯——个个令我老练又年少的女主人讨厌。“这些男孩子的吵吵声让我想吐，”她在课本里这么乱写了一句底下，还有一句出自莫娜之手（莫娜现在总是那么恰到好处的狡猾戏语：“摇辘轱之人如何？”（也是恰到好处）。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Faceless, then, are the chappies I happened to see in her company. There was for instance Red Sweater who one day, the day we had the first snow -- saw her home; from the parlor window I observed them talking near our porch. She wore her first cloth coat with a fur collar; there was a small brown cap on my favorite hairdo -- the fringe in front and the swirl at the sides and the natural curls at the back -- and her damp-dark moccasins and white socks were more sloppy than ever. She pressed as usual her books to her chest while speaking or listening, and her feet gestured all the time: she would stand on her left instep with her right toe, remove it backward, cross her feet, rock slightly, sketch a few steps, and then start the series all over again. There was Windbreaker who talked to her in front of a restaurant one Sunday afternoon while his mother and sister attempted to walk me away for a chat; I dragged along and looked back at my only love. She had developed more than one conventional mannerism, such as the polite adolescent way of showing one is literally "doubled up" with laughter by inclining one's head, and so (as she sensed my call), still feigning helpless merriment, she walked backward a couple of steps, and then faced about, and walked toward me with a fading smile. On the other hand, I greatly liked -- perhaps because it reminded me of her first unforgettable confession -- her trick of sighing "oh dear!" in humorous wistful submission to fate, or emitting a long "no-o' in a deep almost growling undertone when the blow of fate had actually fallen. Above all -- since we are speaking of movement and youth -- I liked to see her spinning up and down Thayer Street on her beautiful young bicycle: rising on the pedals to work on them lustily, then sinking back in a languid posture while the speed wore itself off; and then she would stop at our mailbox and, still astride, would flip through a magazine she found there, and put it back, and press her tongue to one side of her upperlip and push off with her foot, and again sprint through pale shade and sun.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="很不要脸的，是我碰巧在他的同伴中见到的那些花花公子。比如“红毛衣”，有一天，就是我们碰到第一场雪的那天——他送她回家；我站在客厅窗边看见他们在我家前庭处说话。她穿一件带一条兽毛领的棉布外套；我钟爱的发型上扣有一顶褐色小帽——刘海在前，两测是小卷毛，后边有波浪大卷，湿乎乎的黑色鹿皮鞋和白袜上沾满了污泥。她一会说着一会听着，习惯性地把书本抵在胸前，双脚不住地比划着什么：她的两脚相抵，向后移动，双脚交叉，晃了一下，再划八步，又整个重来一遍。还有一次是某星期天的下午，“皮夹克”在饭馆前和她交谈，他每亲和姐姐企图把我支走去聊天；我磨磨蹭蹭，不住回头看着我唯一的所爱。她养成了不止一种的习惯性动作，比如斜斜脑袋，是年轻人礼貌地表示某某二人已经“同眠共枕”的方式，另外，（当她听到了我的叫声），仍然假装嘻闹，后退两步，四处张望，朝我走来时笑意皆飞。另一方面，我深喜她那套哀声叹气的把戏——或许因为它总使我想起她令人难忘的首次忏海——“噢，亲爱的！”，幽默又忧怨地对命运表示顺从，或当命运的打击真地降临时，她用深沉的低音发出一声长长的“不——”。此外——因为我们现在所谈是运动和青春——我总喜欢看她骑着美丽的自行车在塞耶街跑上跑下：踏上踏板，急切地蹬着，当速度自行消减时，她向后仰去，姿式萎顿；而后她停在我们的信箱边，两腿还跨在车上，从箱里取出一本杂志，翻捻一遍，又放团去，舌央抵到上唇一侧，一只脚蹬起车，又全速奔跑在惨淡的树萌和阳光下。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">On the whole she seemed to me better adapted to her surroundings than I had hoped she would be when considering my spoiled slave-child and the bangles of demeanor she naively affected the winter before in California. Although I could never get used to the constant state of anxiety in which the guilty, the great, the tenderhearted live, I felt I was doing my best in the way of mimicry. As I lay on my narrow studio bed after a session of adoration and despair in Lolita's cold bedroom, I used to review the concluded day by checking my own image as it prowled rather than passed before the mind's red eye. I watched dark-and-handsome, not un-Celtic, probably high-church, possibly very high-church, Dr. Humbert see his daughter off to school. I watched him greet with his slow smile and pleasantly arched thick black ad-eyebrows good Mrs. Holigan, who smelled of the plague (and would head, I knew, for master's gin at the first opportunity). With Mr. West, retired executioner or writer of religious tracts -- who cared?-- I saw neighbor what's his name, I think they are French or Swiss, meditate in his frank-windowed study over a typewriter, rather gaunt-profiled, an almost Hitlerian cowlick on his pale brow. Weekends, wearing a well-tailored overcoat and brown gloves, Professor H. might be seen with his daughter strolling to Walton Inn (famous for its violet-ribboned china bunnies and chocolate boxes among which you sit and wait for a "table for two' still filthy with your predecessor's crumbs). Seen on weekdays, around one P. M., saluting with dignity Argus-eyed East while maneuvering the car out of the garage and around the damned evergreens, and down onto the slippery road.</div>

<div class="line_en">Raising a cold eye from book to clock in the positively sultry Beardsley College library, among bulky young women caught and petrified in the overflow of human knowledge. Walking across the campus with the college clergyman, the Rev. Rigger (who also taught Bible in Beardsley School). "Somebody told me her mother was a celebrated actress killed in an airplane accident. Oh? My mistake, I presume. Is that so? I see. How sad." (Sublimating her mother, eh?) Slowly pushing my little pram through the labyrinth of the supermarket, in the wake of Professor W., also a slow-moving and gentle widower with the eyes of a goat. Shoveling the snow in my shirt-sleeves, a voluminous black and white muffler around my neck. Following with no show of rapacious haste (even taking time to wipe my feet on the mat) my schoolgirl daughter into the house. Taking Dolly to the dentist -- pretty nurse beaming at her -- old magazines -- ne montrez pas vos zhambes. At dinner with Dolly in town, Mr. Edgar H. Humbert was seen eating his steak in the continental knife-and-fork manner. Enjoying, in duplicate, a concert: two marble-faced, becalmed Frenchmen sitting side by side, with Monsieur H. H.'s musical little girl on her father's right, and the musical little boy of Professor W. (father spending a hygienic evening in Providence) on Monsieur G. G.'s left. Opening the garage, a square of light that engulfs the car and is extinguished. Brightly pajamaed, jerking down the window shade in Dolly's bedroom. Saturday morning, unseen, solemnly weighing the winter-bleached lassie in the bathroom. Seen and heard Sunday morning, no churchgoer after all, saying don't be too late, to Dolly who is bound for the covered court. Letting in a queerly observant schoolmate of Dolly's: "First time I've seen a man wearing a smoking jacket, sir -- except in movies, of course."</div>
