<div class="line_en">For the next three months Philip went every day to see Mildred. He took his books with him and after tea worked, while Mildred lay on the sofa reading novels. Sometimes he would look up and watch her for a minute. A happy smile crossed his lips. She would feel his eyes upon her.</div>

<div class="line_en">He put aside his book when the landlady came in to lay the cloth for dinner, and in his high spirits he exchanged chaff with her. She was a little cockney, of middle age, with an amusing humour and a quick tongue. Mildred had become great friends with her and had given her an elaborate but mendacious account of the circumstances which had brought her to the pass she was in. The good-hearted little woman was touched and found no trouble too great to make Mildred comfortable. Mildred's sense of propriety had suggested that Philip should pass himself off as her brother. They dined together, and Philip was delighted when he had ordered something which tempted Mildred's capricious appetite. It enchanted him to see her sitting opposite him, and every now and then from sheer joy he took her hand and pressed it. After dinner she sat in the arm-chair by the fire, and he settled himself down on the floor beside her, leaning against her knees, and smoked. Often they did not talk at all, and sometimes Philip noticed that she had fallen into a doze. He dared not move then in case he woke her, and he sat very quietly, looking lazily into the fire and enjoying his happiness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="房东太太进来铺桌布，准备上菜。菲利普把书放到一边，兴冲冲地和她拉起家常。房东太太是个小个子的伦敦女人，已到中年，牙尖嘴利、为人幽默，特别招人喜欢。米尔德里德和她交情很好，把自己沦落到这般境地的原因和她讲了个透彻，只是没几句是真话罢了。这个好心肠的小老太婆被她信口开河编的故事深深触动，只要能让米尔德里德过得舒服些，甘愿自己苦点累点。米尔德里德顾虑面子问题，让菲利普说自己是她的娘家兄弟。他们一起吃饭，只要看到点的菜合上了她变幻莫测的胃口，他就欢喜若狂。坐在对面的她，身上好像有种勾人的魔力。一阵兴起，他就想拉起她的手，轻轻抚摸。吃完饭，她坐在壁炉旁的扶手椅上，他坐在她脚边，靠着她的膝盖，慢慢抽烟。他们经常一句话都不说，有时候菲利普看她打起盹来，一动都不敢动，生怕吵醒她。只安静地坐着，眯眼看壁炉里的火苗，沉浸在幸福中。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She would never acknowledge that she had been asleep. She had a phlegmatic temperament, and her condition did not seriously inconvenience her. She took a lot of trouble about her health and accepted the advice of anyone who chose to offer it. She went for a `constitutional' every morning that it was fine and remained out a definite time. When it was not too cold she sat in St. James' Park. But the rest of the day she spent quite happily on her sofa, reading one novel after another or chatting with the landlady; she had an inexhaustible interest in gossip, and told Philip with abundant detail the history of the landlady, of the lodgers on the drawing-room floor, and of the people who lived in the next house on either side. Now and then she was seized with panic; she poured out her fears to Philip about the pain of the confinement and was in terror lest she should die; she gave him a full account of the confinements of the landlady and of the lady on the drawing-room floor (Mildred did not know her; "I'm one to keep myself to myself," she said, "I'm not one to go about with anybody.") and she narrated details with a queer mixture of horror and gusto; but for the most part she looked forward to the occurrence with equanimity.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她绝不承认自己睡过去了。她气质冷漠，情绪浮动很少，挺着肚子也觉不出生活比起往常有任何不便。她对自己的健康问题非常在意，不管是谁给出些建议，她都一概言听计从。每天早上只要天气不错，都要出去“锻炼身体”，在外面待一段时间。天不太冷的时候，她会跑去圣詹姆斯公园闲坐。剩下的时间就舒舒服服地窝在沙发上一本一本读她的小说，或者和房东太太东拉西扯。她聊起家长里短的闲话总是觉不出累，还把房东太太、住在客厅那层的房客和左邻右舍的点滴历史全说给菲利普听。有时，她也会忽然一阵恐慌，害怕分娩会很痛，说不好就死在产床上了。她把房东太太和住在客厅的女房客分娩时的情况详尽描述了一番（米尔德里德其实不认识那个女房客，用她自己的话解释：“我可是个独来独往的人，不会随便跟别人搭讪。”），那个既害怕又兴奋的样子真是有几分古怪。除了这些时候，她通常还是能镇定自若地等待预产期的到来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She could not sew well and so did not make the necessary things for the baby; she told Philip it was much cheaper in the end to buy them. Philip had lately sold one of the mortgages in which his money had been put; and now, with five hundred pounds in the bank waiting to be invested in something that could be more easily realised, he felt himself uncommonly well-to-do. They talked often of the future. Philip was anxious that Mildred should keep the child with her, but she refused: she had her living to earn, and it would be more easy to do this if she had not also to look after a baby. Her plan was to get back into one of the shops of the company for which she had worked before, and the child could be put with some decent woman in the country.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mildred expected to be confined early in March, and as soon as she was well enough she was to go to the seaside for a fortnight: that would give Philip a chance to work without interruption for his examination; after that came the Easter holidays, and they had arranged to go to Paris together. Philip talked endlessly of the things they would do. Paris was delightful then. They would take a room in a little hotel he knew in the Latin Quarter, and they would eat in all sorts of charming little restaurants; they would go to the play, and he would take her to music halls. It would amuse her to meet his friends. He had talked to her about Cronshaw, she would see him; and there was Lawson, he had gone to Paris for a couple of months; and they would go to the Bal Bullier; there were excursions; they would make trips to Versailles, Chartres, Fontainebleau.</div>

<div class="line_en">She listened to his enthusiasm with smiling eyes. He thought he saw in them a new tenderness, and he was grateful to her. She was much gentler than she used to be. There was in her no longer the superciliousness which had irritated him. She was so accustomed to him now that she took no pains to keep up before him any pretences. She no longer troubled to do her hair with the old elaboration, but just tied it in a knot; and she left off the vast fringe which she generally wore: the more careless style suited her. Her face was so thin that it made her eyes seem very large; there were heavy lines under them, and the pallor of her cheeks made their colour more profound. She had a wistful look which was infinitely pathetic. There seemed to Philip to be in her something of the Madonna. He wished they could continue in that same way always. He was happier than he had ever been in his life.</div>

<div class="line_en">He used to leave her at ten o'clock every night, for she liked to go to bed early, and he was obliged to put in another couple of hours' work to make up for the lost evening. He generally brushed her hair for her before he went. He had made a ritual of the kisses he gave her when he bade her good-night; first he kissed the palms of her hands (how thin the fingers were, the nails were beautiful, for she spent much time in manicuring them,) then he kissed her closed eyes, first the right one and then the left, and at last he kissed her lips.
