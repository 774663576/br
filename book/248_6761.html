<div class="line_en">The town-hall had never looked finer. The platform at the end of it was backed by a showy draping of flags; at intervals along the walls were festoons of flags; the gallery fronts were clothed in flags; the supporting columns were swathed in flags; all this was to impress the stranger, for he would be there in considerable force, and in a large degree he would be connected with the press. The house was full. The 412 fixed seats were occupied; also the 68 extra chairs which had been packed into the aisles; the steps of the platform were occupied; some distinguished strangers were given seats on the platform; at the horseshoe of tables which fenced the front and sides of the platform sat a strong force of special correspondents who had come from everywhere. It was the best -- dressed house the town had ever produced. There were some tolerably expensive toilets there, and in several cases the ladies who wore them had the look of being unfamiliar with that kind of clothes. At least the town thought they had that look, but the notion could have arisen from the town's knowledge of the fact that these ladies had never inhabited such clothes before.</div>

<div class="line_en">The gold-sack stood on a little table at the front of the platform where all the house could see it. The bulk of the house gazed at it with a burning interest, a mouth-watering interest, a wistful and pathetic interest; a minority of nineteen couples gazed at it tenderly, lovingly, proprietarily, and the male half of this minority kept saying over to themselves the moving little impromptu speeches of thankfulness for the audience's applause and congratulations which they were presently going to get up and deliver. Every now and then one of these got a piece of paper out of his vest pocket and privately glanced at it to refresh his memory.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那一袋金子放在主席台前的一张小桌子上，全场都能看得见。在场的大多数人都饶有兴趣地盯着它，这是一种火烧火燎的兴趣，垂涎欲滴的兴趣，望洋兴叹的兴趣。占少数的那十九对夫妇却以亲切、爱抚和拥有者的眼神看着它，而这个少数派中的那一半男性还忙着一遍遍地默诵感谢与会者欢呼与祝贺的答词，他们很快就要站起来发表这篇振奋人心的答词了。这些先生中不时有一位从马甲口袋里摸出一张字条来，偷偷扫上一眼，把忘了的词想起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Of course there was a buzz of conversation going on -- there always is; but at last, when the Rev. Mr. Burgess rose and laid his hand on the sack, he could hear his microbes gnaw, the place was so still. He related the curious history of the sack, then went on to speak in warm terms of Hadleyburg's old and well-earned reputation for spotless honesty, and of the town's just pride in this reputation. He said that this reputation was a treasure of priceless value; that under Providence its value had now become inestimably enhanced, for the recent episode had spread this fame far and wide, and thus had focussed the eyes of the American world upon this village, and made its name for all time, as he hoped and believed, a synonym for commercial incorruptibility. [Applause.] "And who is to be the guardian of this noble fame -- the community as a whole? No! The responsibility is individual, not communal. From this day forth each and every one of you is in his own person its special guardian, and individually responsible that no harm shall come to it. Do you -- -- does each of you -- accept this great trust? [Tumultuous assent.] Then all is well. Transmit it to your children and to your children's children. To-day your purity is beyond reproach -- see to it that it shall remain so. To-day there is not a person in your community who could be beguiled to touch a penny not his own -- see to it that you abide in this grace. ["We will! we will!"] This is not the place to make comparisons between ourselves and other communities -- some of them ungracious towards us; they have their ways, we have ours; let us be content. [Applause.] I am done. Under my hand, my friends, rests a stranger's eloquent recognition of what we are; through him the world will always henceforth know what we are. We do not know who he is, but in your name I utter your gratitude, and ask you to raise your voices in indorsement."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当然啦，场内一直回响着嗡嗡的交谈声——这是常事；可是后来牧师伯杰斯先生起立，把手往那只口袋上一按，全场就静得能让他听见自己身上的跳蚤磨牙了。他先叙述了钱袋子令人神往的来龙去脉，继而热情洋溢地谈起了哈德莱堡因无懈可击的诚实而获得的历史悠久、当之无愧的名望，全镇人对这种名望感到衷心的自豪。他说，这种名望原本就是一份无价之宝；靠上帝保佑，如今这笔财富的价值更是变得不可估量，因为最近发生的这件事把哈德莱堡的名声广为传播，让全美洲所有人的眼光都聚焦在这个镇子上，并使哈德莱堡这个名字永远——这一点他希望并且相信——成为“拒腐蚀”的同义词。（掌声）“那么，靠谁来呵护这笔高尚的财富呢 ——靠全镇人一起来呵护吗？不！呵护哈德莱堡名望的责任是每一个人的，而不是集体的。从今以后，诸位人人都要亲自担任它的特别监护人，各负其责，使它免受任何伤害。请问大家——请问各位——是否接受这个重托呢（台下纷纷答应）？那太好了。还要把这种责任传给你们的后代，子子孙孙传下去。今天你们的纯洁是无可非议的——务必让纯洁永远保持下去。今天，你们中间没有一个人会经不起诱惑去碰别人的钱，非己之财，一文莫取——一定要恪守这种美德（‘一定！一定！’）。这里我不想拿我们镇子和别的镇子对比——尽管有的镇子对我们缺乏善意。大路朝天，各走半边；让我们知足常乐吧（掌声）。我讲完了。朋友们，在我手下，是一位外乡人对我们的令人信服的表彰；通过他，从今以后全世界将永远明白我们是一些什么样的人。我们并不知道他是谁，不过我谨代表各位向他表示感谢，请诸位放开喉咙，表示赞同。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The house had gotten itself all ready to burst into the proper tornado of applause; but instead of doing it, it seemed stricken with a paralysis; there was a deep hush for a moment or two, then a wave of whispered murmurs swept the place -- of about this tenor: "BILLSON! oh, come, this is TOO thin! Twenty dollars to a stranger -- -- or ANYBODY -- BILLSON! Tell it to the marines!" And now at this point the house caught its breath all of a sudden in a new access of astonishment, for it discovered that whereas in one part of the hall Deacon Billson was standing up with his head weekly bowed, in another part of it Lawyer Wilson was doing the same. There was a wondering silence now for a while.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="全场的人正憋足劲要爆发出一阵狂风骤雨般的欢呼声；结果没有这样做，反而像集体中风似的，一起呆了一两秒钟，然后，一阵窃窃私语声在全场蔓延开来——内容诸如此类：“比尔逊！噢，别逗啦，这也太离谱了吧！拿二十块钱给一个外乡人——别管给谁了——就凭比尔逊！这话讲给水手们听还差不多！”这时，全场又因为发觉了另一件新奇事，突然静了下来：在会场的一处站起来的是比尔逊执事，他满脸忠厚地耷拉着脑袋，在另外一处，威尔逊律师也像他一样站了起来。众人好奇地沉默了片刻。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"'The remark which I made to the distressed stranger was this: "You are very far from being a bad man; go, and reform."'" Then he continued: --"We shall know in a moment now whether the remark here quoted corresponds with the one concealed in the sack; and if that shall prove to be so -- and it undoubtedly will -- this sack of gold belongs to a fellow-citizen who will henceforth stand before the nation as the symbol of the special virtue which has made our town famous throughout the land -- Mr. Billson!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我对那位落难的外乡人说的话是：‘你绝对不是一个坏蛋；去吧，改了就好。’”伯杰斯念完后说道：“咱们马上就能知道，这上面写的话和封在钱袋里那句话是否相同；如果相同——这一点毫无疑问——这一袋金子就属于本镇的一位公民了，从今以后，他将作为特立独行的美德模范屹立在国人面前，正是这种美德使本镇蜚声海内——比尔逊先生！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The house rose in a body and made the walls quake with the thunders of its thankfulness for the space of a long minute. Then it sat down, and Mr. Burgess took an envelope out of his pocket. The house held its breath while he slit the envelope open and took from it a slip of paper. He read its contents -- slowly and impressively -- the audience listening with tranced attention to this magic document, each of whose words stood for an ingot of gold:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="全场起立，发出长时间雷鸣般的欢呼声，表达他们的谢意，声音震得四壁乱颤。大家落座以后，伯杰斯先生从衣袋里取出一个信封。他撕开信封，从里面抽出一张字条，全场的人都屏住了呼吸。他用语重心长的口气慢慢念出了字条上的内容——听众心醉神迷地倾听着这句有魔力的、字字千金的话：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I ask the indulgence of the house while I explain this most painful matter. I am sorry to say what I am about to say, since it must inflict irreparable injury upon Mr. Billson, whom I have always esteemed and respected until now, and in whose invulnerability to temptation I entirely believed -- as did you all. But for the preservation of my own honour I must speak -- and with frankness. I confess with shame -- and I now beseech your pardon for it -- that I said to the ruined stranger all of the words contained in the test -- remark, including the disparaging fifteen. [Sensation.] When the late publication was made I recalled them, and I resolved to claim the sack of coin, for by every right I was entitled to it. Now I will ask you to consider this point, and weigh it well; that stranger's gratitude to me that night knew no bounds; he said himself that he could find no words for it that were adequate, and that if he should ever be able he would repay me a thousandfold. Now, then, I ask you this; could I expect -- could I believe -- could I even remotely imagine -- that, feeling as he did, he would do so ungrateful a thing as to add those quite unnecessary fifteen words to his test? -- set a trap for me? -- expose me as a slanderer of my own town before my own people assembled in a public hall? It was preposterous; it was impossible. His test would contain only the kindly opening clause of my remark. Of that I had no shadow of doubt. You would have thought as I did. You would not have expected a base betrayal from one whom you had befriended and against whom you had committed no offence. And so with perfect confidence, perfect trust, I wrote on a piece of paper the opening words -- ending with "Go, and reform," -- and signed it. When I was about to put it in an envelope I was called into my back office, and without thinking I left the paper lying open on my desk." He stopped, turned his head slowly toward Billson, waited a moment, then added: "I ask you to note this; when I returned, a little latter, Mr. Billson was retiring by my street door."

If you will allow me to say it, I think his extra word 'VERY' stands explained: it is attributable to a defect of memory.

Then the Chair said, "Signature, 'Archibald Wilcox.'" And so on, and so on, name after name, and everybody had an increasingly and gloriously good time except the wretched Nineteen. Now and then, when a particularly shining name was called, the house made the Chair wait while it chanted the whole of the test-remark from the beginning to the closing words, "And go to hell or Hadleyburg -- try and make it the for-or-m-e-r!" and in these special cases they added a grand and agonised and imposing "A-a-a-a-MEN!"</div>

We are very poor, we are old, and, have no chick nor child to help us; we were sorely tempted, and we fell. It was my purpose when I got up before to make confession and beg that my name might not be read out in this public place, for it seemed to us that we could not bear it; but I was prevented. It was just; it was our place to suffer with the rest. It has been hard for us. It is the first time we have ever heard our name fall from any one's lips -- sullied. Be merciful -- for the sake or the better days; make our shame as light to bear as in your charity you can." At this point in his reverie Mary nudged him, perceiving that his mind was absent.

[Great sensation.] There wasn't any pauper stranger, nor any twenty-dollar contribution, nor any accompanying benediction and compliment -- these are all inventions. [General buzz and hum of astonishment and delight.] Allow me to tell my story -- it will take but a word or two. I passed through your town at a certain time, and received a deep offence which I had not earned. Any other man would have been content to kill one or two of you and call it square, but to me that would have been a trivial revenge, and inadequate; for the dead do not SUFFER. Besides I could not kill you all -- and, anyway, made as I am, even that would not have satisfied me. I wanted to damage every man in the place, and every woman -- and not in their bodies or in their estate, but in their vanity -- the place where feeble and foolish people are most vulnerable. So I disguised myself and came back and studied you. You were easy game. You had an old and lofty reputation for honesty, and naturally you were proud of it -- it was your treasure of treasures, the very apple of your eye. As soon as I found out that you carefully and vigilantly kept yourselves and your children OUT OF TEMPTATION, I knew how to proceed. Why, you simple creatures, the weakest of all weak things is a virtue which has not been tested in the fire. I laid a plan, and gathered a list of names. My project was to corrupt Hadleyburg the Incorruptible. My idea was to make liars and thieves of nearly half a hundred smirchless men and women who had never in their lives uttered a lie or stolen a penny. I was afraid of Goodson. He was neither born nor reared in Hadleyburg. I was afraid that if I started to operate my scheme by getting my letter laid before you, you would say to yourselves, 'Goodson is the only man among us who would give away twenty dollars to a poor devil' -- and then you might not bite at my bait. But heaven took Goodson; then I knew I was safe, and I set my trap and baited it. It may be that I shall not catch all the men to whom I mailed the pretended test-secret, but I shall catch the most of them, if I know Hadleyburg nature. [Voices. "Right -- he got every last one of them."] I believe they will even steal ostensible GAMBLE-money, rather than miss, poor, tempted, and mistrained fellows. I am hoping to eternally and everlastingly squelch your vanity and give Hadleyburg a new renown -- one that will STICK -- and spread far. If I have succeeded, open the sack and summon the Committee on Propagation and Preservation of the Hadleyburg Reputation.'"</div>

And another thing, when I make a mistake in Hadleyburg nature the man that puts that error upon me is entitled to a high honorarium, and some one must pay. This poor old Richards has brought my judgment to shame; he is an honest man: -- I don't understand it, but I acknowledge it.

Both had strong appetites for money; each had bought a great tract of land, with a purpose; there was going to be a new railway, and each wanted to be in the Legislature and help locate the route to his own advantage; a single vote might make the decision, and with it two or three fortunes.
