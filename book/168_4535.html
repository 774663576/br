<div class="line_en">They laid Lord Hoster in a slender wooden boat, clad in shining silver armor, plate-and-mail. His cloak was spread beneath him, rippling blue and red. His surcoat was divided blue-and-red as well. A trout, scaled in silver and bronze, crowned the crest of the greathelm they placed beside his head. On his chest they placed a painted wooden sword, his fingers curled about its hilt. Mail gauntlets hid his wasted hands, and made him look almost strong again. His massive oak-and-iron shield was set by his left side, his hunting horn to his right. The rest of the boat was filled with driftwood and kindling and scraps of parchment, and stones to make it heavy in the water. His banner flew from the prow, the leaping trout of Riverrun.</div>

<div class="line_en">Seven were chosen to push the funereal boat to the water, in honor of the seven faces of god. Robb was one, Lord Hoster's liege lord. With him were the Lords Bracken, Blackwood, Vance, and Mallister, Ser Marq Piper… and Lame Lothar Frey, who had come down from the Twins with the answer they had awaited. Forty soldiers rode in his escort, commanded by Walder Rivers, the eldest of Lord Walder's bastard brood, a stem, grey-haired man with a formidable reputation as a warrior. Their arrival, coming within hours of Lord Hoster's passing, had sent Edmure into a rage. "Walder Frey should be flayed and quartered!" he'd shouted. "He sends a cripple and a bastard to treat with us, tell me there is no insult meant by that."</div>

<div class="line_en">"I have no doubt that Lord Walder chose his envoys with care," she replied. "It was a peevish thing to do, a petty sort of revenge, but remember who we are dealing with.

<div class="line_en">Blessedly, her son had shown better sense than her brother. Robb had greeted the Freys with every courtesy, found barracks space for the escort, and quietly asked Ser Desmond Grell to stand aside so Lothar might have the honor of helping to send Lord Hoster on his last voyage. He has learned a rough wisdom beyond his years, my son. House Frey might have abandoned the King in the North, but the Lord of the Crossing remained the most powerful of Riverrun's bannermen, and Lothar was here in his stead.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Now," her uncle urged. Beside him, her brother Edmure -- Lord Edmure now in truth, and how long would that take to grow used to? nocked an arrow to his bowstring. His squire held a brand to its point. Edmure waited until the flame caught, then lifted the great bow, drew the string to his ear, and let fly. With a deep thrum, the arrow sped upward. Catelyn followed its flight with her eyes and heart, until it plunged into the water with a soft hiss, well astern of Lord Hoster's boat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“快。”叔叔劝促。旁边的艾德慕弟弟——如今已是奔流城公爵，但何时才能长大？何时才能承担重担？——赶紧搭箭上弓，他的侍从用烙铁将箭点燃。艾德慕等待半晌，举起巨弓，将箭拉到耳畔，“嗖”地一声，释放出去。随着深沉的响动，飞箭腾空而去，带走了凯特琳的目光和心灵，最后却轻轻落在船尾，离目标相去甚远。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Catelyn watched from the battlements, waiting and watching as she had waited and watched so many times before. Beneath her, the swift wild Tumblestone plunged like a spear into the side of the broad Red Fork, its blue-white current churning the muddy red-brown flow of the greater river. A morning mist hung over the water, as thin as gossamer and the wisps of memory.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凯特琳站在砂岩城垛上观望，等待，一如从前万千次地等待。城墙下，迅捷汹涌的腾石河如一杆锋利的长矛，刺入宽广的红叉河中，淡蓝的急流与浑浊的红褐河水相互冲击融汇。晨雾扩散在江面上，轻若蛛网，淡如回忆。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The slim boat drifted out from under the red stone arch of the Water Gate, picking up speed as it was caught in the headlong rush of the Tumblestone and pushed out into the tumult where the waters met. As the boat emerged from beneath the high sheltering walls of the castle, its square sail filled with wind, and Catelyn saw sunlight flashing on her father's helm. Lord Hoster Tully's rudder held true, and he sailed serenely down the center of the channel, into the rising sun.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="细长木船漂过拱形的红石水门，乘上腾石河的急流，逐渐加速，直往喧嚣的河流交汇处。当它在城堡的高墙之外重新出现时，横帆已注满了风，父亲的头盔上闪烁着阳光。船行稳健，将霍斯特·徒利公爵安详地带往河中央，迎向初升的太阳。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Edmure cursed softly. "The wind," he said, pulling a second arrow. "Again." The brand kissed the oil-soaked rag behind the arrowhead, the flames went licking up, Edmure lifted, pulled, and released. High and far the arrow flew. Too far. It vanished in the river a dozen yards beyond the boat, its fire winking out in an instant. A flush was creeping up Edmure's neck, red as his beard. "Once more," he commanded, taking a third arrow from the quiver. He is as tight as his bowstring, Catelyn thought.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="艾德慕轻声咒骂，“该死的风，”他搭起第二支箭，“再来。”烙铁点燃箭头包的油布，焰苗摇曳，弟弟举弓，拉弦，再度释放。这次飞得又高又远，太远了，竟在船头之前十余码处入水，火焰顿时熄灭。艾德慕脖子上爬起一圈红晕，跟胡须一般颜色。“再来，”他命令，一边从箭筒里取出第三支箭。他太紧张，绷得跟弓弦似的，凯特琳心想。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A narrow miss, no more than a handspan, and yet a miss. "The Others take it!" her brother swore. The boat was almost out of range, drifting in and out among the river mists. Wordless, Edmure thrust the bow at his uncle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="差了一点，不到一掌宽，但确实没射中。“该死！”弟弟大声诅咒。船只已快驶到射程之外，在河雾中忽隐忽现。艾德慕无言地将弓交给叔叔。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I can do it," Edmure insisted. He let them light the arrow, jerked the bow up, took a deep breath, drew back the arrow. For a long moment he seemed to hesitate while the fire crept up the shaft, crackling. Finally he released. The arrow flashed up and up, and finally curved down again, falling, falling… and hissing past the billowing sail.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我能行。”艾德慕坚持。他再度点燃箭头，举起弓来，深吸一口气，拉满了弦。这次他瞄了许久，待火焰烧光箭头，爬上箭杆，发出噼里啪啦的声响，才终于发射。箭支风一般地爬升，爬升，然后弧形下降，下降，下降…稍稍略过摇晃的船只。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Catelyn reached out blindly, groping for her brother's hand, but Edmure had moved away, to stand alone on the highest point of the battlements. Her uncle Brynden took her hand instead, twining his strong fingers through hers. Together they watched the little fire grow smaller as the burning boat receded in the distance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凯特琳不由自主地伸手想挽弟弟，艾德慕却已走开，一个人默默地站在城堡最高处。挽住她的是叔叔布林登，用他那刚劲的手指。他们并肩而立，看着火焰逐渐熄灭，燃烧的船只不复得见，彻底消失…">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And then it was gone… drifting downriver still, perhaps, or broken up and sinking.

<div class="line_en">"Swiftly," Ser Brynden said, He nocked an arrow, held it steady for the brand, drew and released before Catelyn was quite sure that the fire had caught… but as the shot rose, she saw the flames trailing through the air, a pale orange pennon. The boat had vanished in the mists. Falling, the flaming arrow was swallowed up as well… but only for a heartbeat. Then, sudden as hope, they saw the red bloom flower. The sails took fire, and the fog glowed pink and orange. For a moment Catelyn saw the outline of the boat clearly, wreathed in leaping flames.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是。”布林登爵士道。他搭起箭，坚定地放到烙铁上，凯特琳还未确定箭头是否点燃，他便举弓迅速射了出去…飞箭临空，她看见火焰划出轨迹，犹如一面淡橙色的三角旗。前方的船只已然消失在迷离中，坠落的羽箭也随即无踪…但一阵心跳之后，骤起犹如希望，红花猛烈绽放。燃烧的风帆将雾气染成粉色和橙色，凯特琳看见船只的轮廓，在飞扬的火舞中挣扎萎缩。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">No sooner had the burning boat vanished from their sight than Edmure walked off. Catelyn would have liked to embrace him, if only for a moment; to sit for an hour or a night or the turn of a moon to speak of the dead and mourn. Yet she knew as well as he that this was not the time; he was Lord of Riverrun now, and his knights were falling in around him, munnuring condolences and promises of fealty, walling him off from something as small as a sister's grief. Edmure listened, hearing none of the words.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时，艾德慕急匆匆离开。凯特琳多么想拥抱他，多么想和弟弟坐在一起，竟日恳谈死者和哀悼，但她明白时候不对：弟弟如今已是奔流城公爵，无数骑士诸侯将要对他致以悼念，约誓忠诚，怎有时间来陪伴伤心的姐姐呢？艾德慕静静地听着人们的语言，一句话也没有说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Last night in his cups he had broken down and wept, full of regrets for things undone and words unsaid. He ought never to have ridden off to fight his battle on the fords, he told her tearfully; he should have stayed at their father's bedside. "I should have been with him, as you were," he said. "Did he speak of me at the end? Tell me true, Cat. Did he ask for me?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"With his first shaft." Catelyn had been too young to remember, but Lord Hoster had often told the tale. "His second found the sail." She sighed.

He seemed to enjoy the company of his bride's brothers, as well; young Rollam his squire and Ser Raynald his standard-bearer. They are standing in the boots of those he's lost, Catelyn realized when she watched them together.

Robb was doing all he could, yet still the blows kept falling, one after the other, relentless. When they brought him word of the battle at Duskendale, where Lord Randyll Tarly had shattered Robett Glover and Ser Helman Tallhart, he might have been expected to rage.
