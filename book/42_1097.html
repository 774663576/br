<div class="line_en">All too soon Stanley was back out on the lake, sticking his shovel into the dirt. X-Ray was right: the third hole was the hardest. So was the fourth hole. And the fifth hole. And the sixth, and the…</div>

<div class="line_en">After a while he'd lost track of the day of the week, and how many holes he'd dug. It all seemed like one big hole, and it would take a year and a half to dig it. He guessed he'd lost at least five pounds. He figured that in a year and a half he'd be either in great physical condition, or else dead.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不一会儿，他忽然想不起来今天是星期几了，也忘了自己挖了多少个洞。一切似乎是一个硕大无边的洞，要花上一年半的时间才能挖完。他猜自己至少已经瘦了五磅。他想着再过一年半，他要么变得非常健康，要么已经死了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Stanley stared at the pile a moment, unsure if he'd even seen it. Even if it was something, what good would it do him? He'd promised to give anything he found to X-Ray. It didn't seem worth the effort to climb out of his hole to check it out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯坦利盯着土堆看了一会儿，不确定自己是否真的看到了什么。即使真的有什么，对他又有什么好处呢？他答应过X光，要把发现的东西给他。看来似乎没必要花力气爬出洞去检查一遍。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His hole was waist deep. He dug his shovel into the dirt. As he dumped it out, he thought he saw something glisten as it fell onto the dirt pile. Whatever it was, it was quickly buried.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯坦利的洞已经及腰深了。他把铲子扎进土里。将土抛出洞外的时候，他觉得有一样闪闪发亮的东西也被扔到了土堆上。还没弄清那是什么，很快就被埋在了土里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He dug his shovel back into the earth, scooped out some dirt, and lifted it over his dirt pile. But instead of dumping it there, he tossed it off to the side. His curiosity had gotten the better of him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他把铲子重新插回土里，挖了一些土，然后将铲子高高地举过土堆。但这回他没有将土抛到土堆上，而是扔到了一旁。好奇心占了上风。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He glanced up at the cloud, which was close enough to the sun that he had to squint to look at it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他抬头瞟了一眼云。云距离太阳已经很近了，他不得不眯缝着眼睛看。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He climbed up out of his hole and sifted his fingers through the pile. He felt something hard and metallic.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他用了几滴宝贵的水将管子清洗干净。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He pulled it out. It was a gold tube, about as long and as wide as the second finger on his right hand. The tube was open at one end and closed at the other.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他把那东西拔了出来——一根金色的细管。管子的长度和粗细大约都跟他的右手食指一样，一头封着口，另一头敞着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There seemed to be some kind of design on the flat, closed end. He poured a few more drops of water on it and rubbed it on the inside of his pants pocket.</div>

<div class="line_en">He looked at the large piles of dirt near where X-Ray was digging. X-Ray was probably almost finished for the day. Getting the rest of the day off would hardly do him much good. X-Ray would first have to show the tube to Mr. Sir or Mr. Pendanski, who would then have to show it to the Warden. By then X-Ray might be done anyway.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他看着X光挖出的那堆土。X光可能快要干完活儿了，剩下的时间里休息对他而言已经没有多少意义了。X光首先要将管子拿给长官先生或潘登斯基先生过目，然后由他们俩交给管理员大人查看。而到那时，X光可能都完工了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_pic"><img src="../img/book2/holes/1.jpg"/></div>
<div class="line_en">He tried to figure out some way that he wouldn't have to give it to X-Ray. He could just keep it, but that wouldn't do him any good. He wanted a day off.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯坦利想方设法地不把管子交给X光。他可以自己保留，可是这对他一点好处也没有。他想得到一天的假期。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Stanley wondered about trying to secretly take the tube directly to the Warden. He could explain the situation to the Warden, and the Warden might make up an excuse for giving him the day off, so X-Ray wouldn't suspect.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“洞穴人，你那儿有什么事吗？”锯齿问道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Besides, he didn't know if the Warden would find the tube "interesting." He looked at it again. It looked familiar. He thought he'd seen something like it, somewhere before, but couldn't quite place it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="况且，他还不知道管理员大人会不会觉得这根管子“有趣”。他又看了看管子。看上去很眼熟。他记得好像在哪里见过类似的东西，可就是想不起究竟是什么地方。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He looked across the lake toward the cabin under the two oak trees. The place scared him. He'd been at Camp Green Lake almost two weeks, and he still hadn't seen the Warden. That was just as well. If he could go his entire year and a half without seeing the Warden, that would be fine with him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他望着湖对岸那两棵橡树下的小木屋。那地方令他心生畏惧。来翠湖营快两个星期了，他还从来没见过管理员大人。那倒没什么。如果这一年半结束的时候他都不用见管理员大人，对他来说也挺不错的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Stanley's large hand closed around the tube. "Nothin', just, uh…" It was useless. "I think I might have found something."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯坦利用大手把管子遮起来。“没什么，只是，呃…”这样做很徒劳，“我想我可能发现了一样东西。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">X-Ray looked at the tube, then rubbed his dirty glasses on his dirty shirt and looked at the tube again. One by one, the other boys dropped their shovels and came to look.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="X光看着管子，接着在自己脏兮兮的衬衫上蹭了蹭同样脏兮兮的眼镜，然后又继续打量管子。其他男孩也都陆陆续续地放下铲子，凑过来看。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yeah, that's probably what it is," said Stanley. He decided not to mention the engraved design. Maybe nobody would notice it. He doubted X-Ray could see it.</div>

<div class="line_en">Stanley raised and lowered his shoulder. "So, why don't you wait until tomorrow to show it to Mom?" he suggested. "You can pretend you found it first thing in the morning. Then you can get the whole day off, instead of just an hour or so this afternoon."</div>
