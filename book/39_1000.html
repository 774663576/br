<div class="line_en">Lore has it my father once wrestled a black bear in Baluchistan with his bare hands. If the story had been about anyone else, it would have been dismissed as "laaf", that Afghan tendency to exaggerate-sadly, almost a national affliction; if someone bragged that his son was a doctor, chances were the kid had once passed a biology test in high school. But no one ever doubted the veracity of any story about Baba. And if they did, well, Baba did have those three parallel scars coursing a jagged path down his back. I have imagined Baba's wrestling match countless times, even dreamed about it. And in those dreams, I can never tell Baba from the bear.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was Rahim Khan who first referred to him as what eventually became Baba's famous nickname, "Toophan agha", or "Mr. Hurricane."It was an apt enough nickname. My father was a force of nature, a towering Pashtun specimen with a thick beard, a wayward crop of curly brown hair as unruly as the man himself, hands that looked capable of uprooting a willow tree, and a black glare that would "drop the devil to his knees begging for mercy, as Rahim Khan used to say.

<div class="line_en">In the late 1960s, when I was five or six, Baba decided to build an orphanage. I heard the story through Rahim Khan. He told me Baba had drawn the blueprints himself despite the fact that he'd had no architectural experience at all. Skeptics had urged him to stop his foolishness and hire an architect. Of course, Baba refused, and everyone shook their heads in dismay at his obstinate ways. Then Baba succeeded and everyone shook their heads in awe at his triumphant ways. Baba paid for the construction of the two-story orphanage, just off the main strip of Jadeh Maywand south of the Kabul River, with his own money. Rahim Khan told me Baba had personally funded the entire project, paying for the engineers, electricians, plumbers, and laborers, not to mention the city officials whose "mustaches needed oiling."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="1960年代晚期，我五六岁的样子，爸爸决定建造一座恤孤院。故事是拉辛汗告诉我的。他说爸爸亲自设计施工图，尽管他根本没有半点建筑经验。人们对此表示怀疑，劝他别犯傻，雇个建筑师得了。当然，爸爸拒绝了，人们大摇其头，对爸爸的顽固表示不解。然而爸爸成功了，人们又开始摇头了，不过这次是带着敬畏，对他成功的法门称赞不已。恤孤院楼高两层，位于喀布尔河南岸，在雅德梅湾大道旁边，所耗资费均由父亲自己支付。拉辛汗说爸爸独力承担了整个工程，工程师、电工、管道工、建筑工，这些人的工钱都是爸爸支付的。城里的官员也抽了油水，他们的“胡子得上点油”。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Baba was impossible to ignore, even in his sleep. I used to bury cotton wisps in my ears, pull the blanket over my head, and still the sounds of Baba's snoring -- so much like a growling truck engine-penetrated the walls. And my room was across the hall from Baba's bedroom. How my mother ever managed to sleep in the same room as him is a mystery to me. It's on the long list of things I would have asked my mother if I had ever met her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爸爸即使在睡觉的时候，也是引人注目。我常在耳朵里面塞上棉花球，用毯子盖住头，但爸爸的鼾声宛如轰轰作响的汽车引擎，依然穿墙越壁而来，而我们的房间中间还隔着客厅呢。妈妈如何能跟他睡在同一个房间？我不得而知。要是能见到我的妈妈，我还有一长串问题。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We sat at a picnic table on the banks of the lake, just Baba and me, eating boiled eggs with "kofta" sandwiches-meatballs and pickles wrapped in "naan". The water was a deep blue and sunlight glittered on its looking glass-clear surface. On Fridays, the lake was bustling with families out for a day in the sun. But it was midweek and there was only Baba and me, us and a couple of longhaired, bearded tourists -- "hippies," I'd heard them called. They were sitting on the dock, feet dangling in the water, Fishing poles in hand. I asked Baba why they grew their hair long, but Baba grunted, didn't answer. He was preparing his speech for the next day, flipping through a havoc of handwritten pages, making notes here and there with a pencil. I bit into my egg and asked Baba if it was true what a boy in school had told me, that if you ate a piece of eggshell, you'd have to pee it out. Baba grunted again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们在湖边的野餐桌旁边坐下来，只有爸爸跟我，吃着水煮蛋和肉丸夹饼——就是馕饼夹着肉丸和腌黄瓜。湖水澄蓝，波平如镜，阳光照在湖上熠熠生辉。每逢周五，总有很多家庭到湖边，在阳光下度过假期。但那天不是周末，那儿只有我们——爸爸和我，还有几个留着胡子和长发的游客，我听说他们叫“嬉皮士”。他们坐在码头上，手里拿着钓鱼竿，脚板在水里晃荡。我问爸爸，为什么那些人留着长头发，但爸爸没有回答，只哼了一声。他正准备翌日的演讲，翻阅着一叠手稿，不时用铅笔做些记号。我吃一口鸡蛋，告诉爸爸，学校里面有个男孩说，要是吃下鸡蛋壳，就得将它尿出来。我问爸爸这是不是真的，爸爸又哼了一声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It took three years to build the orphanage. I was eight by then. I remember the day before the orphanage opened, Baba took me to Ghargha Lake, a few miles north of Kabul. He asked me to fetch Hassan too, but I lied and told him Hassan had the runs. I wanted Baba all to myself. And besides, one time at Ghargha Lake, Hassan and I were skimming stones and Hassan made his stone skip eight times. The most I managed was five. Baba was there, watching, and he patted Hassan on the back. Even put his arm around his shoulder.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="恤孤院工程耗时三年，盖好的那年我八岁。我记得恤孤院落成前一天，爸爸带我去喀布尔以北几英里远的喀尔卡湖。他让我叫上哈桑，但我撒谎，说哈桑有事情要做。我要爸爸全属我一人。再说，有一次哈桑和我在喀尔卡湖畔打水漂，他的石头跳了八下，我用尽力气，也只能跳五下。爸爸在旁边看着我们，他伸手拍拍哈桑的后背，甚至还用手臂搂住他的肩膀。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Outside the orphanage, the next day, they ran out of chairs. A lot of people had to stand to watch the opening ceremony. It was a windy day, and I sat behind Baba on the little podium just outside the main entrance of the new building. Baba was wearing a green suit and a caracul hat. Midway through the speech, the wind knocked his hat off and everyone laughed. He motioned to me to hold his hat for him and I was glad to, because then everyone would see that he was my father, my Baba. He turned back to the microphone and said he hoped the building was sturdier than his hat, and everyone laughed again. When Baba ended his speech, people stood up and cheered. They clapped for a long time. Afterward, people shook his hand. Some of them tousled my hair and shook my hand too. I was so proud of Baba, of us.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="翌日，在恤孤院外面，椅子没有来客多。很多人只好站着观看落成庆典。那天刮风，新建筑的大门外面搭了个礼台，爸爸坐在上面，我坐在他后面。爸爸身穿绿色套装，头戴羔羊皮帽。演讲当中，风把他的帽子吹落，人们开怀大笑。他示意我替他把帽子捡回来，我很高兴，因为当时人人可以看到他是我的父亲，我的爸爸。他转过身，对着麦克风说，他希望这座房子比他的皮帽来得牢靠，人们又大笑起来。爸爸演讲结束的时候，大家站起来，欢呼致意，掌声经久不息。接着，来宾与他握手。有些人摸摸我的头发，也跟我握手。我为爸爸自豪，为我们骄傲。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But despite Baba's successes, people were always doubting him. They told Baba that running a business wasn't in his blood and he should study law like his father. So Baba proved them all wrong by not only running his own business but becoming one of the richest merchants in Kabul. Baba and Rahim Khan built a wildly successful carpet-exporting Business, two pharmacies, and a restaurant.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽说爸爸事业兴旺，人们总是说三道四。他们说爸爸没有经商的天分，应该像爷爷那样专研法律。所以爸爸证明他们统统错了：他不仅经营着自己的生意，还成了喀布尔屈指可数的巨贾。爸爸和拉辛汗创办了一家日进斗金的地毯出口公司，两家药房，还有一家餐厅。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">With me as the glaring exception, my father molded the world around him to his liking. The problem, of course, was that Baba saw the world in black and white.

<div class="line_en">When people scoffed that Baba would never marry well -- after all, he was not of royal blood -- he wedded my mother, Sofia Akrami, a highly educated woman universally regarded as one of Kabul's most respected, beautiful, and virtuous ladies. And not only did she teach classic Farsi literature at the university she was a descendant of the royal family, a fact that my father playfully rubbed in the skeptics faces by referring to her as "my princess."</div>

<div class="line_en">When I was in fifth grade, we had a mullah who taught us about Islam. His name was Mullah Fatiullah Khan, a short, stubby man with a face full of acne scars and a gruff voice. He lectured us about the virtues of "zakat" and the duty of "hadj"; he taught us the intricacies of performing the five daily "namaz" prayers, and made us memorize verses from the Koran -- and though he never translated the words for us, he did stress, sometimes with the help of a stripped willow branch, that we had to pronounce the Arabic words correctly so God would hear us better. He told us one day that Islam considered drinking a terrible sin; those who drank would answer for their sin on the day of "Qiyamat", Judgment Day. In those days, drinking was fairly common in Kabul. No one gave you a public lashing for it, but those Afghans who did drink did so in private, out of respect. People bought their scotch as "Medicine" in brown paper bags from selected "pharmacies." They would leave with the bag tucked out of sight, sometimes drawing furtive, disapproving glances from those who knew about the store's reputation for such transactions.</div>

Then he lowered himself into the leather sofa, put down his drink, and propped me up on his lap. I felt as if I were sitting on a pair of tree trunks.

<div class="line_en">IN SCHOOL, we used to play a game called "Sherjangi", or "Battle of the Poems." The Farsi teacher moderated it and it went something like this: You recited a verse from a poem and your opponent had sixty seconds to reply with a verse that began with the same letter that ended yours. Everyone in my class wanted me on their team, because by the time I was eleven, I could recite dozens of verses from Khayyam, Hãfez, or Rumi's famous "Masnawi". One time, I took on the whole class and won. I told Baba about it later that night, but he just nodded, muttered, "Good."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="上学时，我们常常玩一种连句的游戏，也就是诗歌比赛。教授法尔西语课的老师从中主持，规则大抵是这样的：你背一句诗，你的对手有六秒钟的时间可以回答，但必须是以你背出来那句诗最后一个字开头的诗句。班里人人都想跟我一组，因为那时十一岁的我已经能背出迦亚谟【Omar Khayyam 1048～1122，古代波斯诗人，代表作为《鲁拜集》Rubaiyat of Omar Khayya'm】、哈菲兹【Shamseddin Mohammad Ha~fez约1320～约1388，古代波斯诗人】的数十篇诗歌，也能诵得鲁米著名的《玛斯纳维》【Mowlana Jalaluddin Rumi 1207～1273，古代波斯诗人，《玛斯纳维》Masnavi是他的故事诗】。有一次，我代表全班出战，并且旗开得胜。那天夜里我告诉爸爸，他只是点点头，咕哝了一声：“不错。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That was how I escaped my father's aloofness, in my dead mother's books. That and Hassan, of course. I read everything, Rumi, Hãfez, Saadi, Victor Hugo, Jules Verne, Mark Twain, Ian Fleming. When I had finished my mother's books -- not the boring history ones, I was never much into those, but the novels, the epics -- I started spending my allowance on books. I bought one a week from the bookstore near Cinema Park, and stored them in cardboard boxes when I ran out of shelf room.</div>

The least I could have done was to have had the decency to have turned out a little more like him. But I hadn't turned out like him. Not at all.</div>

<div class="line_en">Of course, marrying a poet was one thing, but fathering a son who preferred burying his face in poetry books to hunting… well, that wasn't how Baba had envisioned it, I suppose. Real men didn't read poetry -- and God forbid they should ever write it! Real men-real boys-played soccer just as Baba had when he had been young. Now "that" was something to be passionate about. In 1970, Baba took a break from the construction of the orphanage and flew to Tehran for a month to watch the World Cup games on television, since at the time Afghanistan didn't have TVs yet. He signed me up for soccer teams to stir the same passion in me. But I was pathetic, a blundering liability to my own team, always in the way of an opportune pass or unwittingly blocking an open lane. I shambled about the field on scraggy legs, squalled for passes that never came my way. And the harder I tried, waving my arms over my head frantically and screeching, "I'm open! I'm open!" the more I went ignored. But Baba wouldn't give up. When it became abundantly clear that I hadn't inherited a shred of his athletic talents, he settled for trying to turn me into a passionate spectator. Certainly I could manage that, couldn't I? I faked interest for as long as possible. I cheered with him when Kabul's team scored against Kandahar and yelped insults at the referee when he called a penalty against our team. But Baba sensed my lack of genuine interest and resigned himself to the bleak fact that his son was never going to either play or watch soccer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当然，跟诗人结婚是一回事，但生个喜欢埋首诗书多过打猎的儿子…这么说吧，那可不是爸爸所希望看到的，我想。真正的男人不看诗——真主也禁止他们创作呢。真正的男人——真正的男孩——应该像爸爸小时候那样踢足球去，那才是值得付出热情的玩意儿。1970年，爸爸暂停了恤孤院的工程，飞往德黑兰，在那儿停留一个月：由于阿富汗当时还没有电视，他只好去那边看世界杯足球赛。为了激起我对足球的热情，他替我报名参加球队。但我这个可怜虫变成球队的负担，不是传丢了球，就是愚蠢地挡住队友的进攻路线。我瘦弱的双腿跌跌撞撞地在球场上奔跑，声嘶力竭，球却不会滚到我脚下来。我越是喊得起劲，双手在头顶尽力挥舞，高声大喊：“传给我，传给我！”队友越是对我视若不见。但爸爸从不放弃。等到他没有将任何运动天分遗传给我的事实昭然若揭之后，他又开始试着把我变成一个热情的观众。当然，我能做得到，不是吗？我尽量装得兴致勃勃。我跟他一起，每逢喀布尔队跟坎大哈Kandahar，阿富汗南部城市。队比赛，就大喊大叫；每逢我们的球队遭到判罚，就咒骂裁判。但爸爸察觉到我并非真心实意，只好黯然放弃，接受这个悲惨的事实：他的儿子非但不喜欢玩足球，连当观众也心不在焉。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I remember one time Baba took me to the yearly "Buzkashi" tournament that took place on the first day of spring, New Year's Day. Buzkashi was, and still is, Afghanistan's national passion. A "chapandaz", a highly skilled horseman usually patronized by rich aficionados, has to snatch a goat or cattle carcass from the midst of a melee, carry that carcass with him around the stadium at full gallop, and drop it in a scoring circle while a team of other "chapandaz" chases him and does everything in its power -- kick, claw, whip, punch -- to snatch the carcass from him. That day, the crowd roared with excitement as the horsemen on the field bellowed their battle cries and jostled for the carcass in a cloud of dust. The earth trembled with the clatter of hooves. We watched from the upper bleachers as riders pounded past us at full gallop, yipping and yelling, foam flying from their horses' mouths.</div>
