<div class="line_en">"We can't keep protecting him," Mom whispered to Dad, who was driving. "We can't just pretend he's going to wake up tomorrow and this isn't going to be his reality, because it is, Nate, and we have to help him learn to deal with it. We can't just keep avoiding situations that…"</div>

<div class="line_en">I don't know how long I was sleeping, but when I woke up, there was a full moon outside the car window. It was a purple night, and we were driving on a highway full of cars. And then I heard Mom and Dad talking about me.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a long drive home. I fell asleep in the backseat like I always do, my head on Via's lap like she was my pillow, a towel wrapped around the seat belt so I wouldn't drool all over her. Via fell asleep, too, and Mom and Dad talked quietly about grown-up things I didn't care about.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="开车回家路途遥远。我把头枕在维娅大腿上，像往常一样在后座睡着了，安全带上绑了一条毛巾，这样我就不会糊得她一身口水。维娅也睡着了，妈妈和爸爸轻声讨论着大人们的事情，我一点兴趣也没有。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"So sending him off to middle school like a lamb to the slaughter…," Dad answered angrily, but he didn't even finish his sentence because he saw me in the mirror looking up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这样送他去中学就像待宰的羔羊……”爸爸生气地说，但是他话没说完就打住了，因为他从后视镜里看到我正抬头张望。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="突然之间，他们俩好像达成了一致。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我知道，那是一个善意的谎言，”她回答道，“那是你入学时需要进行的测验。对了，你完成得非常出色。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“事后我才想到，”妈妈叹道，“是的，我应该早点告诉你的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你会喜欢他的。”妈妈补充道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"We didn't know if you'd even get in, Auggie," answered Mom. "It's a very hard school to get into. There's a whole admissions process. I didn't see the point in telling you and having you get all worked up about it unnecessarily."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们不知道你能否进得去，奥吉，”妈妈回答道，“这所学校很难进，有一整套招生程序。我不觉得告诉你有什么意义，只会让你产生不必要的担忧。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"This year would be better, Auggie," said Mom. "You know why? Because you'll be going into fifth grade, and that's the first year of middle school -- for everyone. You won't be the only new kid."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“今年更好，奥吉，”妈妈说，“你知道为什么吗？因为你要上五年级，那是初中的第一年——对每个人而言都是。这样你就不会是唯一的新生了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I shouldn't have said that," Dad said, looking at me in the rearview mirror. "It's not true. Here's the thing: Mommy and I love you so much we want to protect you any way we can. It's just sometimes we want to do it in different ways."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不该那么说，”爸爸从后视镜里看着我说，“不是那样的。亲爱的，妈妈和我都爱你，我们想尽全力来保护你。只是有时候，我们做事的方式有所不同。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Maybe I'll go next year," I answered, looking out the window.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“也许明年我会去。”我看着窗外回答。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm not going to say it won't be a big challenge for you, because you know better than that," she answered. "But it'll be good for you, Auggie. You'll make lots of friends. And you'll learn things you'd never learn with me." She turned in her seat again and looked at me. "When we took the tour, you know what they had in their science lab? A little baby chick that was just hatching out of its egg. It was so cute! Auggie, it actually kind of reminded me of you when you were a little baby… with those big brown eyes of yours…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不是说这对你不是一个巨大的挑战，因为你知道它远远超过了挑战，”她回答道，“但上学对你有好处，奥吉。你会交很多朋友。你也能学到很多从我这里永远学不到的东西。”她又从座位上转过身来，看着我。“我们参观时，你知道在他们的科学实验室里有什么吗？一只刚刚从鸡蛋里孵出来的小鸡。它是那么可爱！实际上，它让我想起你还是个婴儿的时候……你那双棕色的大眼睛……”">查看中文翻译</div>
