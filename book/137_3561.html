<div class="line_en">Quasimodo who did not hear, saw the naked swords, the torches, the irons of the pikes, all that cavalry, at the head of which he recognized Captain Phoebus; he beheld the confusion of the outcasts, the terror of some, the disturbance among the bravest of them, and from this unexpected succor he recovered so much strength, that he hurled from the church the first assailants who were already climbing into the gallery.</div>

<div class="line_en">The reader will, perhaps, recall the critical situation in which we left Quasimodo. The brave deaf man, assailed on all sides, had lost, if not all courage, at least all hope of saving, not himself (he was not thinking of himself), but the gypsy. He ran distractedly along the gallery. Notre-Dame was on the point of being taken by storm by the outcasts. All at once, a great galloping of horses filled the neighboring streets, and, with a long file of torches and a thick column of cavaliers, with free reins and lances in rest, these furious sounds debouched on the Place like a hurricane,— "France! France! cut down the louts! Châteaupers to the rescue! Provostship! Provostship!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="读者大概还记得，我们离开卡席莫多的时候，他正处于万分危急的时刻。这个好聋子遭到重重围攻，虽然还没有丧失全部勇气，至少已不再抱希望救出——不是救出他自己，他不想自己，而是救出埃及姑娘。他在走道上狂奔乱跑。圣母院即将被无赖汉攻陷。猝然，群马奔驰的声音响彻附近各条街道，只见火把高举，长龙一般，密集纵队的骑兵，伏鞍横戈，冲向前来，暴怒的吼叫犹如狂风暴雨，扫荡广场：“法兰西！法兰西！斩杀贱民！夏多佩驰援来到！管带！管带！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was, in fact, the king's troops who had arrived.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="确实是国王的军队来了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The battle was frightful. There was a dog's tooth for wolf's flesh, as P. Mathieu says. The king's cavaliers, in whose midst Phoebus de Châteaupers bore himself valiantly, gave no quarter, and the slash of the sword disposed of those who escaped the thrust of the lance. The outcasts, badly armed foamed and bit with rage. Men, women, children, hurled themselves on the cruppers and the breasts of the horses, and hung there like cats, with teeth, finger nails and toe nails. Others struck the archers' in the face with their torches. Others thrust iron hooks into the necks of the cavaliers and dragged them down. They slashed in pieces those who fell.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一场混乱的恶战。像马太神父说的，既是狼的肉，就有狗牙来咬。孚比斯·德·夏多佩在国王的骑兵中间英勇奋战。他们绝不宽恕，逃脱了枪尖的人在剑下丧命。无赖汉武器窳劣，怒火千丈，乱咬乱抓。男女老少蹿上马背，跳上马脖子，用牙齿、用四肢的爪子，猫似的紧揪住不放。还有人抡起火把，乱戳弓手的脸。也有人用铁钩子砍入骑者的颈脖，把他们拖了过来。掉下来的都被撕成碎片。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The vagabonds behaved bravely. They defended themselves like desperate men. Caught on the flank, by the Rue Saint-Pierre-aux-Boeufs, and in the rear through the Rue du Parvis, driven to bay against Notre-Dame, which they still assailed and Quasimodo defended, at the same time besiegers and besieged, they were in the singular situation in which Comte Henri Harcourt, Taurinum obsessor idem et obsessus, as his epitaph says, found himself later on, at the famous siege of Turin, in 1640, between Prince Thomas of Savoy, whom he was besieging, and the Marquis de Leganez, who was blockading him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无赖汉英勇不屈，拼死自卫。侧面从牛头圣彼得教堂街，尾部从前庭街受敌，被逼迫背抵着圣母院，他们却还在攻打主教堂。卡席莫多继续守卫着圣母院。这样，既是围攻者，又是被围攻者，好汉帮处在一种奇特的境地。自从一六四〇年著名的围攻都灵之战，亨利·达尔库伯爵既围攻萨伏瓦的托马斯亲王，又被勒加奈侯爵封锁，正如他在书信中所说，Taurinum obsessor idem et obsessus（115），自从那时以来，现在这是第二次。【注：（115）拉丁文，围攻都灵同时又被围攻。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At length the vagabonds gave way. Weariness, the lack of good weapons, the fright of this surprise, the musketry from the windows, the valiant attack of the king's troops, all overwhelmed them. They forced the line of assailants, and fled in every direction, leaving the Parvis encumbered with dead.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="终于，无赖汉败退了。精疲力竭，没有精良武器，遭到突袭而陷于恐慌，从窗口射来枪弹，王室兵卒大砍大杀，——这一切压倒了他们。他们冲出包围圈，开始四向逃窜，前庭上遗尸比比皆是。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the meantime, windows had been opened again. The neighbors hearing the war cries of the king's troops, had mingled in the affray, and bullets rained upon the outcasts from every story. The Parvis was filled with a thick smoke, which the musketry streaked with flame. Through it one could confusedly distinguish the front of Notre-Dame, and the decrepit Hôtel-Dieu with some wan invalids gazing down from the heights of its roof all checkered with dormer windows.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这当儿，四周的窗子已经打开。邻人们听见王室兵卒的喊杀声，也投入了战斗，各座楼房上弹如雨下，扑杀无赖汉。前庭广场烟雾迷漫，火铳射击划出一道道火光。隐约可见圣母院建筑正面和破破烂烂的市医院。市医院屋顶高处有几个脸色惨白的病人从窗洞里窥视。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One was noticed who had a large, glittering scythe, and who, for a long time, mowed the legs of the horses. He was frightful. He was singing a ditty, with a nasal intonation, he swung and drew back his scythe incessantly. At every blow he traced around him a great circle of severed limbs. He advanced thus into the very thickest of the cavalry, with the tranquil slowness, the lolling of the head and the regular breathing of a harvester attacking a field of wheat. It was Chopin Trouillefou. A shot from an arquebus laid him low.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="只见其中一人手执闪闪亮的宽大镰刀，一直在砍马腿。非常可怕！他用鼻音哼着一首歌曲，挥镰不懈，又不断抽回他的大镰。挥舞之处，只见身旁四周砍下的马腿堆成一大圈。他就这样专拣骑群密集之处砍杀，不慌不忙，徐徐前进，像刈割者切入麦地那样摇晃着脑袋，均匀地喘气。这是克洛班·特鲁伊甫。然而，弓弩响起，他应声倒地。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When Quasimodo, who had not ceased to fight for a moment, beheld this rout, he fell on his knees and raised his hands to heaven; then, intoxicated with joy, he ran, he ascended with the swiftness of a bird to that cell, the approaches to which he had so intrepidly defended. He had but one thought now; it was to kneel before her whom he had just saved for the second time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡席莫多一刻也没有停止战斗。当他看见无赖汉溃退的时候，跪倒在地，举手向天；接着，欣喜若狂，鸟儿一般飞速向上奔跑，跑到他那样英勇保卫、不许任何人进犯的那间小室。他现在只有一个念头，就是，跪在他刚刚再次搭救了的姑娘的面前。">查看中文翻译</div>
