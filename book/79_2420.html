<div class="line_en">Half an hour ago the sounds had ceased. All of them, all at once. The elevator, the party, the sound of room doors opening and closing. Instead of easing her mind it made the tension that had been building in her even worse; it was like a malefic hush before the storm's final brutal push. But Danny had dozed off almost at once; first into a light, twitching doze, and in the last ten minutes or so a heavier sleep. Even looking directly at him she could barely see the slow rise and fall of his narrow chest.</div>

<div class="line_en">At first she had dismissed it as the wind, which could mimic many different human vocal ranges, from a papery deathbed whisper around the doors and window frames to a full-out scream around the eaves… the sound of a woman fleeing a murderer in a cheap melodrama. Yet, sitting stiffly beside Danny, the idea that it was indeed voices became more and more convincing., Jack and someone else, discussing his escape from the pantry.</div>

Then the party had begun again (or did it ever stop? did it sometimes just drift into a slightly different angle of time where they weren't meant to hear it?) counterpointed by the crashing, banging elevator. Then that had stopped. In that new silence, as Danny had been falling asleep, she had fancied she heard low, conspiratorial voices coming from the kitchen almost directly below them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="先是杰克停止了嗥叫和砸门，然后晚会又开始了。（晚会停止过吗？是不是它有时候飘进一个稍稍不同的时间角度，那儿的声音他们听不见？）电梯的哐当哐当声也加入了大合唱，后来又停了。在这刚刚降临的沉寂中，在丹尼睡着了的时候，她仿佛听见厨房里传来了鬼鬼祟祟的声音，几乎就在他们的正下方。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She heard the mallet whistle through the air and then agony exploded on her right side as the mallet-head took her just below the line of her breasts, breaking two ribs. She fell forward on the steps and new agony ripped her as she struck on the wounded side. Yet instinct made her roll over, roll away, and the mallet whizzed past the side of her face, missing by a naked inch. It struck the deep pile of the stair carpeting with a muffled thud. That was when she saw the knife, which had been jarred out of her hand by her fall. It lay glittering on the fourth stair riser.</div>
