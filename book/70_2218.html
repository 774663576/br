<div class="line_en">For Ella, it was as if time had stopped. The prince loved the mystery princess? Kit loved her? After believing that the magical night at the ball would be the last time she ever saw Kit, Ella's hope sprung anew. Kit was declaring his love for her. A blush crept up Ella's cheeks, and she felt her heart come alive.</div>

<div class="line_en">Without a word to her stepsisters, she turned and raced back toward the house. She needed to get to the palace as soon as possible. There was no way she was going to be able to present herself in the beautiful gown she had worn to the ball, but she did have one thing that would help her prove her identity -- the glass slipper.

Oh, how right she had been.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="瑞拉没顾上跟姐姐们说话，转身朝家里飞奔而去。她必须尽快到王宫去。虽然她没办法再穿上舞会那天穿着的那条华丽裙子，但她至少有一件东西可以证明自己的身份——那只水晶鞋。瑞拉笑了，她想到仙女教母在那个神奇的夜晚说过的话：“你永远不知道像鞋子这样的细节有多么重要。”噢，她说得太对了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"There must be quite a story to go with it," Lady Tremaine said, dangling the slipper off one finger. "Will you tell me?" Ella shook her head. "Then I will tell you a story.

The next time, she married for the sake of her children. But this man, too, was taken from her." She smiled at Ella, but it was a cold smile that didn't reach her eyes. "And she was doomed to look every day upon his beloved child."</div>
