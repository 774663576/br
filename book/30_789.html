<div class="line_en">Amy said not to worry, Mr. Dawson wouldn't hurt anyone. Still, Janet was growing more nervous with each step closer to the old man's house. When they got close enough, Dawson looked up with his usual frown, but when he saw it was Amy, a broad smile changed his entire face as he said, "Hello Miss Amy. I see you've got a little friend with you today."</div>

<div class="line_en">One Friday, 12-year-old Janet was going to stay all night with her friend Amy. They had to walk by Dawson's house on the way to Amy's house, but as they got close Janet saw him sitting on his front porch and suggested they cross over to the other side of the street. Like most of the children, she was scared of the old man because of the stories she'd heard about him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一个周五，12岁的珍妮特要陪她的朋友艾米在这里过夜。她们去艾米家的路上，不得不经过道森先生的房子。当她们离道森家越来越近时，珍妮特看见道森先生坐在前廊，于是她建议她们从街道的另一边走。跟大多数孩子一样，珍妮特听说过他的故事，对他很是害怕。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mr. Dawson was an old grouch, and everyone in town knew it. Kids knew not to go into his yard to pick a delicious apple, even off the ground, because old Dawson, they said, would come after you with his ball bullet gun.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="道森先生是个脾气古怪的老头子，镇上所有人都知道。孩子们知道不能进入他的院子里摘美味的苹果，甚至掉在地上的也不能捡，因为据他们说，老道森会端着他的弹丸猎枪跟在你后面追。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Amy explained that when she first started walking past his house he wasn't very friendly and she was afraid of him, but she pretended he was wearing an invisible smile and so she always smiled back at him. It took a while, but one day he half-smiled back at her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="艾米解释说，当她第一次路过他家时，他不是太友好，她还很害怕他。但她假装他带着一种看不见的微笑，所以她微笑着回望他。过了一段时间，终于有一天，他也对她露出了一点笑容。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We're always on the go trying to accomplish so much, aren't we? Getting groceries, cleaning the house, mowing the lawn -- there's always something. It's so easy to get caught up in everyday life that we forget how simple it can be to bring cheer to ourselves and others. Giving a smile away takes so little effort and time, let's make sure that we've not the one that others have to pretend is wearing an invisible smile.</div>
