<div class="line_en">It is as I told you; and I am leaving to-morrow evening. Richard and I thought it could be done with less obtrusiveness after dark. I feel rather frightened, and therefore ask you to be sure you are on the Melchester platform to meet me. I arrive at a little to seven. I know you will, of course, dear Jude; but I feel so timid that I can't help begging you to be punctual. He has been so VERY kind to me through it all!</div>

<div class="line_en">The up-train by which she was departing stopped by signal only. To Sue it seemed strange that such a powerful organization as a railway train should be brought to a stand-still on purpose for her -- a fugitive from her lawful home.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她坐的上行车要看到信号才停。她觉得一列力量如此强大的火车竟然为她这个逃出合法家庭的人停下来，可谓奇矣。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The twenty minutes' journey drew towards its close, and Sue began gathering her things together to alight. At the moment that the train came to a stand-still by the Melchester platform a hand was laid on the door and she beheld Jude. He entered the compartment promptly. He had a black bag in his hand, and was dressed in the dark suit he wore on Sundays and in the evening after work. Altogether he looked a very handsome young fellow, his ardent affection for her burning in his eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这段旅程经过二十分钟就结束了，苏开始把自己的东西归到一起，准备下车。火车在麦尔切斯特站刚一靠站，就有人把车门推开，原来正是裘德。他立刻进了车厢，手上拿着黑提包，身穿礼拜天和工余晚上才穿的深色套装，真是个非常英俊的小伙子。他眼里燃烧着对她的热烈的情意。">查看中文翻译</div>

If she wants to start afresh I have only too obvious reasons for not hindering her."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我同意了。我原先想，我要是这么一办，肯定非把她第二回结婚搞吹了不可，无论如何，我不想让她吃亏。说到底，她未必就比我坏！好在这一带没人知道这档子事，而且我发现办离婚手续根本没什么困难。既然她想另起炉灶，我可是没有任何显著的理由挡她的道。”">查看中文翻译</div>

I may hold the opinion that, in a proper state of society, the father of a woman's child will be as much a private matter of hers as the cut of her underlinen, on whom nobody will have any right to question her. But partly, perhaps, because it is by his generosity that I am now free, I would rather not be other than a little rigid. If there had been a rope-ladder, and he had run after us with pistols, it would have seemed different, and I may have acted otherwise. But don't press me and criticize me, Jude! Assume that I haven't the courage of my opinions. I know I am a poor miserable creature. My nature is not so passionate as yours!"</div>

<div class="line_en">"That's not good and loyal of you!" she said, and drawing away from him as far as she could, looked severely out into the darkness. She added in hurt tones, without turning round: "My liking for you is not as some women's perhaps. But it is a delight in being with you, of a supremely delicate kind, and I don't want to go further and risk it by -- an attempt to intensify it! I quite realized that, as woman with man, it was a risk to come. But, as me with you, I resolved to trust you to set my wishes above your gratification. Don't discuss it further, dear Jude!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你说这话可真不该，真是不忠不信！”她说，挪开身子，尽可能离开他远些，神情严厉地望着外面的夜色。她没转过身，便又用受了很大委屈的口气说，“我这样喜爱你，也许跟一些女人喜爱男人不一样，可是我跟你在一块儿实在是一种欢乐，这种欢乐极度微妙，存乎一心；我可不想再进一步，为了叫欢乐更强烈，就去冒失掉欢乐的危险。我心里完全明白，按女人跟男人的关系，危险总是免不了的。不过拿我跟你的关系说，我已经想定了，我能信赖你，你能把我的愿望置于你自我满足之上。这件事别再往下谈啦，亲爱的裘德！”">查看中文翻译</div>
