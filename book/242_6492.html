<div class="line_en">At last, in May, Charlotte went away with her. They went to York first, where they visited a wonderful church, York Minster. "If men can make something as beautiful as this," Anne whispered, "what is God's real home like?"</div>

<div class="line_en">That was not the end of my sadness. Anne, too, became ill. She could not breathe, she coughed, her face was white. But she was more sensible than Emily. She took all her medicines, and did everything the doctors said. It didn't help much. In the spring she said she wanted to go to the sea, to a warmer place. The doctors told her to wait. I thought she would die before she went.</div>

<div class="line_en">Anne was the baby of the family, the youngest and prettiest of them all. Before she died, she wrote another book -- The Tenant of Wildfell Hall -- about a woman who left her cruel husband. She was proud of it, and so was I. She was twenty-nine years old.

<div class="line_en">In 1852, just before Christmas, a terrible thing happened. I heard some of it from my room. My curate, Arthur Nicholls, opened the door to Charlotte's sitting-room, and stood there. His face was white, and he was shaking.</div>
