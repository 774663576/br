<div class="line_en">Harry kept to his room, with his new owl for company. He had decided to call her Hedwig, a name he had found in A History of Magic. His school books were very interesting. He lay on his bed reading late into the night, Hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as she pleased. It was lucky that Aunt Petunia didn't come in to vacuum anymore, because Hedwig kept bringing back dead mice. Every night before he went to sleep, Harry ticked off another day on the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall, counting down to September the first.</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry's last month with the Dursleys wasn't fun. True, Dudley was now so scared of Harry he wouldn't stay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon didn't shut Harry in his cupboard, force him to do anything, or shout at him -- in fact, they didn't speak to him at all. Half terrified, half furious, they acted as though any chair with Harry in it were empty. Although this was an improvement in many ways, it did become a bit depressing after a while.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利与德思礼一家相处的最后一个月并不愉快。说真的，达力着实被哈利吓坏了，他不敢跟哈利待在同一个房间里，佩妮姨妈和弗农姨父也不敢再把哈利关在碗柜里，也不强迫他干活儿了，也不再朝他大喊大叫——事实上，他们根本不跟他讲话。一半出于恐惧，一半由于恼怒，他们对哈利的存在视而不见。尽管这在许多方面是一个进步，但时间一久就使人感到有些没趣。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On the last day of August he thought he'd better speak to his aunt and uncle about getting to King's Cross station the next day, so he went down to the living room where they were watching a quiz show on television. He cleared his throat to let them know he was there, and Dudley screamed and ran from the room.</div>

He got up and pulled on his jeans because he didn't want to walk into the station in his wizard's robes -- he'd change on the train. He checked his Hogwarts list yet again to make sure he had everything he needed, saw that Hedwig was shut safely in her cage, and then paced the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up. Two hours later, Harry's huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into the Dursleys' car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into sitting next to Harry, and they had set off.</div>

<div class="line_en">He stopped a passing guard, but didn't dare mention platform nine and three-quarters. The guard had never heard of Hogwarts and when Harry couldn't even tell him what part of the country it was in, he started to get annoyed, as though Harry was being stupid on purpose. Getting desperate, Harry asked for the train that left at eleven o'clock, but the guard said there wasn't one. In the end the guard strode away, muttering about time wasters. Harry was now trying hard not to panic. According to the large clock over the arrivals board, he had ten minutes left to get on the train to Hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it; he was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly lift, a pocket full of wizard money, and a large owl.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他拦住一个过路的警卫，但不敢提起9又3/4站台。警卫从来没听说过霍格沃茨。当他发现哈利甚至说不清霍格沃茨具体在什么地方时，他开始生气了，认为哈利在故意装傻愚弄他。哈利实在没辙了，只好问十一点发出的列车有几班。警卫说一班也没有。最后警卫迈着大步走开了，一路抱怨有些人专门浪费别人的时间。这时哈利告诫自己尽量不要惊慌失措。到达列车时刻表上方的大钟显示，再过十分钟他就该登上开往霍格沃茨的列车了，可他一点也不知道该怎么办。他身边是一只他简直提不动的大箱子，满满一口袋魔币和一只大猫头鹰，他站在站台中央，一筹莫展。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic number nine over one platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it, and in the middle, nothing at all.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Have a good term," said Uncle Vernon with an even nastier smile. He left without another word. Harry turned and saw the Dursleys drive away. All three of them were laughing. Harry's mouth went rather dry. What on earth was he going to do? He was starting to attract a lot of funny looks, because of Hedwig. He'd have to ask someone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“祝你学期顺利，”弗农姨父说着又咧嘴一笑，显得更没有好心。他没有再说什么就走开了。哈利转身眼看弗农一家开车离去。他们三个人都在哈哈大笑。哈利觉得嘴有点儿发干。他究竟该怎么办呢？因为海德薇，他已经招来许多好奇的目光。他得找人问问。">查看中文翻译</div>
