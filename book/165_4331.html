<div class="line_en">Once Gravity left the Oort Cloud behind, the ship entered true outer space. From here, the sun appeared as just another star behind the ship. It lost its reality and became like an illusion. In every direction, all one could see was a bottomless abyss, and the only objects whose existence could be ascertained by the senses were the droplets flying in formation with Gravity. The droplets flanked the ship at a distance of about five kilometers, just visible to the naked eye. Those aboard Gravity liked to gaze at the droplets with telescopes as a source of comfort in the endless emptiness. Observing the droplets was, in a sense, just looking at themselves. The mirrorlike surface of the droplets reflected an image of Gravity. The dimensions were a bit distorted, but due to the perfect smoothness of the surface, the image was particularly clear. With sufficient magnification on their telescopes, the observers could even pick out the porthole, and themselves in it, in the reflection.</div>

<div class="line_en">A decade ago, Gravity had passed through the Oort Cloud. This region, about one light-year from the sun at the edge of the Solar System, was the birthplace of comets. Blue Space and Gravity were the first human spaceships to cross this border. The region didn't feel anything like a cloud, though. Once in a while, a frozen ball of dirt and ice -- a tailless comet -- passed tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of kilometers away, invisible to the naked eye.</div>

<div class="line_en">Most of the one hundred-plus officers and crew aboard Gravity didn't experience this solitude because they had spent the majority of the past fifty years in hibernation. During routine cruising, only about five to ten crew members needed to be on duty. As the crew rotated through hibernation, each person was usually on duty for three to five years.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但“万有引力”号上一百多名官兵中的大部分人感觉不到这种寂寥，他们在冬眠中度过了这五十年中的大部分时间。飞船日常航行时的值班人员只有五至十人，在轮换值勤中，每人的值勤时间只有三至五年。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The entire pursuit was a complex game of acceleration between Gravity and Blue Space. First of all, Blue Space couldn't just accelerate continuously, as doing so would cost it precious fuel and ultimately deprive it of mobility. Even if it managed to escape Gravity, it would be committing suicide in the endless empty desert of outer space if it exhausted its fuel. Although Gravity had more fuel onboard than Blue Space, it had constraints of its own. Since it needed to be prepared for a return voyage, its fuel reserves had to be divided into four equal parts: the acceleration away from the Solar System; the deceleration before its destination; the acceleration toward the Solar System; and the deceleration before arriving at the Earth. Thus, the portion available for acceleration during the pursuit amounted to only one-quarter of the fuel. Based on calculations of Blue Space's previous maneuvers and intelligence gathered by the sophons, Gravity had an accurate idea of Blue Space's fuel reserves, but the latter had no information about the former's stores. Thus, in this game, Gravity knew all the cards held by Blue Space, while Blue Space struggled in ignorance. During pursuit, Gravity consistently maintained a speed higher than Blue Space, but neither ship approached their maximum velocities. Moreover, twenty-five years after the start of the chase, Blue Space stopped accelerating, perhaps because it had used up all the fuel it dared.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="整个追击过程，就是 “万有引力”号和 “蓝色空间”号两舰间复杂的加速博弈过程。首先， “蓝色空间”号不可能进行无限制加速，那样会耗尽燃料，失去机动能力，即使摆脱追击，面对前方茫茫的太空荒漠也等于自杀。而 “万有引力”一号的加速也受到限制，它的燃料贮备虽然远多于 “蓝色空间”号，但要考虑返航，这样，在没有意外发生的情况下，燃料应分成四等份使用，分别是：向太阳系外加速，返航前的减速，返航向太阳系加速，到达地球前的减速。所以，能够用于追击加速的燃料只占总贮备量的四分之一。好在通过对之前航行记录的计算和智子情报， “万有引力”号能够精确掌握 “蓝色空间”号的燃料贮备量，而后者对前者的燃料情况则一无所知，所以在这场博弈中， “万有引力”号能看到 “蓝色空间”号手中的牌。反之则不行。在双方交替的加速中， “万有引力”号一直保持着高于 “蓝色空间”号的速度，但两舰的最终速度与它们能达到的最高速度都相差甚远。在追击开始后的第二十五年，也许是已经达到了燃料消耗的底线， “蓝色空间”号停止了加速。">查看中文翻译</div>

There was a special psychological monitoring corps aboard, comprising more than a dozen crew members out of the full complement of just over a hundred. Some crew members had wondered whether Gravity was a stellar ship or a psychiatric hospital. And then there was also the annoying civilian psychiatrist West, who thought of everything in terms of mental disorders and illnesses and blockages, until one could come to the conclusion that he would subject a clogged toilet to psychiatric analysis.

<div class="line_en">The doctor pulled Guan Yifan along, and the two drifted toward the bow of the ship. If the ship were accelerating, going from the stern of the ship to the bow would be equivalent to climbing up a one-kilometer well, but in the weightlessness of coasting, the trip was a lot easier. Plaza #1 was located at the bow of the cylindrical ship, under a semispherical, transparent dome. Standing there was like standing in space itself. Compared to the holographic projections of the star field on the walls of spherical cabins, this place induced an even stronger sense of the "desubstantiation effect."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Desubstantiation effect" was a concept from astronautic psychology. Humans on Earth were surrounded by objects, and the image of the world in their subconscious was thus material and substantial. But in deep space, away from the Solar System, the stars were only distant points of light and the galaxy was nothing more than a luminous mist. To the senses and the mind, the world lost its materiality, and empty space dominated. A space voyager's subconscious image of the world thus became desubstantiated. This mental model was the baseline in astronautic psychology. Mentally, the ship became the only material entity in the universe. At sub-light speeds, the motion of the ship was undetectable, and the universe turned into one boundless, empty exhibition hall. Here, the stars were illusions, and the ship was the only object on display. This mental model brought with it a profound sense of loneliness, and it could cause the voyager to have subconscious delusions of being a "superobserver" toward the lone "object on display." This feeling of being completely exposed could lead to passivity and anxiety.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“去物质效应”是宇航心理学中的一个概念。当人们身处地球世界时，周围被物质实体所围绕，潜意识中的世界图像是物质的和实体的；但在远离太阳系的外太空中，星星只是遥远的光点，银河系也只是一片发光的薄雾，从感官和心理上，世界己经失去了质量和实体感，空间主宰了一切，于是，航行者潜惫识中的世界图像由物质的变成了虚空的，这个心理模型是宇航心理学的甚本坐标。这时，在心理层面上，飞船成为了宇宙中唯一的一个物质实体。在亚光速下，飞船的运动是不可察觉的，宇宙变成了一间没有边际的空旷展厅，群星都像幻觉，飞船是唯一的展品。这种心理模型可能带来巨大的孤独感，并且很容易在潜愈识中产生对“展品”的超级观察者的幻想，进而又带来因完全暴露而产生的被动感和不安。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Thus, many of the negative psychological effects of deep-space flight were due to the extreme openness of the external environment. In West's extensive professional experience, it was extremely rare to develop claustrophobia the way Guan Yifan did. Even stranger to West was the fact that Guan did not seem relieved by the vast, open sky of Plaza #1; the restlessness caused by claustrophobia seemed to abate not one whit. This tended to support Guan's assertion that his claustrophobia had nothing to do with the narrow confines of his observatory. West grew even more interested in his case.</div>

The two ships were now only one hundred thousand kilometers apart, and coasting at approximately the same speed. At the scale of deep space, the two ships were practically flying in close formation. The leadership of both ships was in the process of negotiating the technical details of their docking. But Blue Space was still too far away to be seen with the naked eye. The droplets were invisible as well. Based on the agreement made with Trisolaris half a century ago, the droplets had shifted to a position about three hundred thousand kilometers from both Gravity and Blue Space. The two ships and the droplets formed a narrow isosceles triangle.</div>
