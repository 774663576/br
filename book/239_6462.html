<div class="line_en">"I've sent them all!" the King cried happily when he saw Alice. "Did you happen to meet any soldiers, my dear, as you came through the wood?"</div>

<div class="line_en">They were very strange soldiers, she thought. They were always falling over something or other, and when one soldier went down, several more always fell over him. Soon the ground was covered with fallen men.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她想这些士兵真够奇特。他们总是跌倒在什么东西上。一个士兵倒下，更多的士兵就倒在他上面。片刻之间，地面上到处是倒下的人了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The next moment soldiers came running through the wood, at first in twos and threes, then ten or twenty together, and at last in great crowds that seemed to fill the forest. Alice got behind a tree and watched them go past.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="稍后，士兵跑步穿过树林，起先是三三两两的，随后是十个二十个，最后是成群成群的，似乎把整个森林都塞满了。爱丽丝躲在树后看着他们过去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then came the horses. With four feet, they managed better than the foot-soldiers, but even they fell more often than not. And when a horse fell, the rider always fell off at once. It was almost like a battle in itself, and Alice decided it would be safer to move on. Soon she came to an open place, where she found the White King sitting on the ground, busily writing in his notebook.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="后来马过来了。马有四条腿，因此跑得比步兵平稳，但即使这样也经常摔倒。马一摔倒，骑士总是马上掉下来。这种局面几乎本身就像一场战斗。爱丽丝拿定主意，离开此地会更安全。不久，她来到了一个开阔地。在那儿，她看见白方国王坐在地上，忙着在笔记本上写东西。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes, I did," said Alice. "Several thousand, I think."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“碰上了，我想有好几千。”爱丽丝答道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Four thousand two hundred and seven," the King said, looking at his book. "I couldn't send all the horses, because two of them are wanted in the game. And I haven't sent the Messengers, Haigha and Hatta. I need them myself, of course -- to come and go. One to come, and one to go."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="国王看了看本子，说：“共4207位。我不能把马匹都派出去，因为象棋里需要两枚马。而且我也没把黑格与哈特两位信使派去。当然，我需要他们来回穿梭送信。一个来，一个去。”">查看中文翻译</div>
