<div class="line_en">Dylan closed her mouth and looked at him attentively, watching his reactions. He was still frozen, his eyes searching the darkness. Dylan glanced once more in the direction of his gaze, but still couldn't see what had caused Tristan's response. His tension was infectious, though, and she felt her stomach tightening. Her heart started to beat faster and she had to concentrate on inhaling through her nose to keep her breathing under control.</div>

<div class="line_en">"What is it?" Dylan squinted in the direction he was looking, but could see nothing out of the ordinary through the gloom. She could just make out the shape of hills in the distance, and the track that they were descending. Though she stared fixedly for a long moment, nothing moved. She was about to open her mouth to ask what he had seen when he held up his hand, motioning for quiet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是什么？”迪伦顺着他凝视的目光看过去，但昏暗中并没有看到什么奇异的东西。她只能分辨出远处群山的轮廓，还有他们刚刚走下来的那条小路。尽管她目不转睛地盯了很久，但没有看到什么东西在动。她刚想张嘴问问他到底看到了什么，崔斯坦就伸手示意她安静。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Wolves?" she mouthed, too frightened to speak. He nodded. Dylan looked back at the landscape in front of them, searching the black grasses for the silhouettes. It was still empty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是狼吗？”她用嘴唇示意，心里害怕极了，不敢出一点声音。他点点头。迪伦再看看前方，目光搜索着黑漆漆的草丛，想找出狼的轮廓，可是前方空空如也。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The wind seemed to pick up as they stood there, whipping around them. The noise rushed in Dylan's ears, but above it she thought she detected a faint howling. The same animal noises they had heard earlier. Tristan had said that they were nothing to worry about, but his rigid posture told her otherwise.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们站在那里，风力似乎增强了，像鞭子抽打在身上。迪伦的耳边响起一阵噪声，她觉得自己听到的是微弱的号叫声，就像之前听到的动物发出的吼叫。崔斯坦说过它们没什么好担心的，而他此时凝然不动的姿势告诉她完全不是这么回事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"There's a derelict wooden cabin at the bottom of this hill." His words were whispered too, but fervent. "We need to reach it. We're going to have to go a little faster, Dylan."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“山脚下有一间废弃的小木屋，”他也用耳语在说，但语气急迫，“我们要到那儿去。我们得快一点了，迪伦。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His words frightened Dylan. She scanned the dark, half hoping that the danger would reveal itself, half hoping that it would not. She could see nothing, but the darkness was thickening somehow. Even the ground at her feet was now just a black shadow. If she tried to go faster she would fall, possibly taking Tristan down with her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的话让迪伦不寒而栗。她朝黑暗中扫视，既盼着危险能自己现形，又盼着它千万别出现。她什么也看不见，但黑暗却越来越浓重了，连脚下的路也变得一团黑。要是她走快的话，她就会摔倒，或许会把崔斯坦一块儿带倒。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What are we going to do?" she whispered. Anxiety had pushed her unconsciously closer to him, seeking protection, and she was able to murmur into his ear.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们该怎么办？”她小声问。满心的焦虑让她不由自主地靠近他寻求保护，她对着他的耳朵低语。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Tristan, I can't see," she mumbled, fear making her voice catch.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“崔斯坦，我看不见。”她小声嘀咕着，生怕声音被听到了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I've got you," he said, and the certainty in his voice gave her courage, warmed the chill in her chest. He reached for her hand, fingers curling around hers and then gripped it tightly. Dylan realised with a start that this was the first time they had touched. She was nearly glad that it was dark. Despite the horror of the moment, she felt almost jittery from the contact. His hand was very warm, and the hold he took on her fingers was strong. Immediately she felt safer. His confidence was obvious in every word, every movement. It gave her confidence, too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我会拉着你的。”他说，他声音里的果敢自信给了她勇气，让她冰冷的胸口涌动起一股暖意。他伸手去够她的手，他们的手指紧紧扣在一起。迪伦忽然一下子意识到这是他们第一次身体接触。还好天黑了。尽管此时深感恐惧，但她还是对这次牵手有些紧张不安。他的手非常温暖，她的手指被他牢牢抓着，她一下子感觉安全多了。他的一言一语、一举一动中都透着自信，这也给了她自信。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Let's go," he said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们走吧。”他说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He led the way forward at a much faster pace. Dylan tried to keep up, but the darkness was thick and she could no longer see the rocks or clumps of grass, and so she tripped and stumbled often, already unbalanced from descending such a steep incline. Her trainers were old and the treads on them were worn. At one point she put her foot down heavily on a patch of gravel and it slid right out from under her. Her other foot tried to find purchase on the ground but it hit the hill at an awkward angle. Forced to put her full weight on it, the muscles in her ankle wobbled and strained, trying to hold her upright. She felt a sharp pain as the joint twisted under her. With a whimper, she felt herself falling, her leg buckling, but Tristan's hand kept a firm grip on hers and he tensed his arm, yanking her to a halt and stopping the back of her head smacking against the cold ground. At that moment he seemed to be impossibly strong. With just one arm he pulled her back upright, almost lifting her off the ground before settling her back on her feet. In the next second he was urging her forward again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他在前面带路，步伐快了许多。迪伦想尽力跟上，但夜色深沉，她根本看不见岩石和草丛，所以一路不停地磕磕绊绊、跌跌撞撞，下陡坡的时候身子已经失去了平衡。她的跑鞋已经旧了，鞋底都烂了。她的一只脚重重踩在一片碎石子上，石子在脚下一滑。她的另一只脚本想找一个牢靠的立足点站稳，但落地时的角度很别扭，她只能把全部重心都放在这只脚上，踝骨上的肌肉承受了她的全部重量，一阵痉挛紧张。随着下肢的关节一扭，她感到一阵刺痛，腿一弯，身体不由自主地往下倒。但崔斯坦的手牢牢地抓着她，胳膊一使劲，猛地把她拉起，当她的后脑勺快要撞到冰冷地面的时候，一切都戛然而止了。在这一刻，他似乎无比强壮。他只用一只手就拽着她的后背，几乎把她离地举起，最后稳稳地把她放在地上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You're doing great, Dylan, keep going," he told her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你真棒，迪伦，继续。”他对她说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Almost there," he said, slightly breathless.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“就快到了。”他有点上气不接下气地说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The animal wailing was getting louder, closer. It was now a constant, interweaving orchestra of noise. Dylan couldn't guess how many creatures were circling them. She still hadn't caught even a glimpse of a wolf, though her eyes darted left and right, scanning the area around them. Still, they were almost there now. They would make it. She was glad that the cabin looked a lot sturdier than the tumbledown cottage that they had been forced to sleep in the night before. There would have been nowhere to hide, no way to keep them out. They were so close now that Dylan could almost make out the reflection of her frightened face in the windowpane.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="动物的哀号声越来越响亮，离他们越来越近。现在噪声持续不断，已经交织在一起。迪伦猜不出到底有多少野兽包围了他们。尽管她的眼睛左一眼右一眼地瞥，但始终没看见一只狼。不过，他们快要到了，他们就要成功了。头天晚上他们不得已留宿的小屋简直破败不堪，这间木屋看起来要比那间坚固多了，她不禁心中一喜。他们现在距离小屋已经近在咫尺了，迪伦几乎能看到自己那张受惊吓的脸映在窗玻璃上的倒影。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The ground levelled out and Dylan felt more comfortable trying to stride forward. Her ankle throbbed with every step, but she was sure that it was only twisted, not sprained. Tristan pressed on faster, encouraging her into an uneven jog.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在脚下的路平坦了，迪伦大步向前走的时候好受多了。她每走一步，脚踝都会有一阵抽痛，但她确定脚只是崴了一下，还没有伤及筋骨。崔斯坦催着她再走快一点。有他在旁边打气，她干脆忽快忽慢地小跑起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Looking forward, Dylan thought she could make out the faint outline of a building not far ahead. It was, as Tristan had said, a wooden cabin. As they moved closer the details began to appear. This place had a door still intact, with two glass windows on either side. The roof was a steep apex with a little slightly lopsided chimney poking out at one end. They would reach it in just a couple of minutes with the pace Tristan was setting.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦向前看，能够辨认出前方不远处一间房子模糊的轮廓。正像崔斯坦说的那样，这是间小木屋。他们离屋子越来越近，小屋的细部也开始呈现在眼前。屋门还算完整，一边一扇玻璃窗子，屋顶是个陡峭的尖顶，从屋顶一端伸出一根略有些倾斜的烟囱。按崔斯坦现在的速度，他们几分钟之内就能到了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Tristan, what's happening?" she shrieked, casting her voice above the wind and the howling, which was rising in a frightening crescendo, interspersed with hisses and screams. The ice in her chest made it painful to breath.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“崔斯坦，发生了什么？”她大喊起来，声音飘荡在风声和号叫声之上。那令人恐惧的号叫越来越响亮，夹杂着嘶嘶声和呐喊声。她的胸口冰凉，呼吸间一阵阵刺痛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">These were not wolves.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="它们不是狼。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That was when she felt it. It began as a chill around her heart, and then her breath seemed to freeze in her lungs. In the dark she couldn't see them; she could merely make out the movement in the air, shadows upon shadows. They whirled before her and she felt the air stir against her skin as they snaked around her. Testing, tasting the air.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然，她感觉自己的心脏周围弥漫着一股冷气，随后肺里的呼吸几乎冻结凝固了。天太黑她看不见它们。她只能分辨出空气中有东西在动，一个黑影接着一个黑影。它们在她的身前旋转，在它们迂回包围她的时候，她能感受到搅动的空气打在皮肤上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Something rushed past her. Although she yanked her head back quickly enough to snap her jaw shut, the thing slashed across her face, causing a burning across the bridge of her nose and her cheek. She wiped her hand roughly across her skin and felt wetness there. She was bleeding.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有东西从她身边飞驰而过。尽管她的头迅速往回一收，但那东西还是在她脸上划出一道口子。她的鼻梁和脸颊一阵火辣辣地疼。她手一抹感觉湿湿的，她在流血。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"They're here." Tristan's voice was full of dread, and so quiet that the words seemed not to be for her ears. Nonetheless Dylan heard them, and they scared her more than anything else. There was something odd about the way he spoke. It was as if he had known these creatures were coming, as if he knew what they were. What secrets was he keeping from her?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“它们来了。”崔斯坦的声音充满了恐惧，这静静的声音好像不是在和她说话。但迪伦听到了，没有什么比这句话更让她感到恐怖了。他说话的样子有点怪，就好像他事先已经知道这些动物要来，就好像他知道它们是什么。他有什么秘密要瞒着自己呢？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She felt fingers reaching for her, and searched the air for his hand, but came up empty. Then suddenly she was grabbed by what felt like hundreds of hands, that seemed to have no more substance than smoke. They were strong though, and through the sheer force of their numbers she felt them pulling her downward, even though there was nowhere to go. Instinctively she flailed with her arms, trying to knock them away, but her hands found nothing in the air. What was going on? These were not animals or birds. She stopped moving and felt the substanceless things return immediately. How could she fight something she couldn't touch? Under the combined strength of the creatures, her legs collapsed and she sank to the ground.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她感觉有手指在摸索着找她，于是也在空中够他的手，结果什么也没摸到。紧接着突然间，她感觉像是有成百上千只手抓住了她，那些手无影无形，轻如风烟，但力道又极强。她感觉它们人多势众，要把她往下拖，又不知要把她拖向何方。出于本能，她双臂拼命挣扎，尽力想甩脱它们，但是她的手在空中一无所获。现在到底是怎么回事？既不是鸟也不是兽。她不再动弹，感觉这无形的东西马上退了回去。她该怎样和自己摸不到的东西搏斗呢？在这些生物的合力之下，她的腿一软，瘫倒在地上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Out of the gloom in front of her a shadow appeared, heading straight for her. She didn't have time to react, to step sideways out of its path, or even brace herself. But the impact she was waiting for never came. Amazingly, the shadow seemed to pass right through her. She wasn't sure if she imagined it, but it felt like a frozen arrow passing through her body. Dropping Tristan's hand, she grabbed her middle, expecting to find a wound, or hole, but her jumper was completely intact.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="前方一片昏暗中，一个黑影闪过，直奔她而来。她没有时间做出反应去闪到路的一旁，她连做好应付的准备都来不及。但是等待中的一击却没有出现。令人惊奇的是，那个阴影似乎直接穿过了她。她不确定是不是自己产生了幻觉，但她感觉像是有一支冰封的利箭穿过了身体。她松开崔斯坦的手，手捂着腹部，想要找到伤口或者破洞，但外套却完好无缺。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Although he was standing right next to her, Tristan's voice seemed very far away. It barely registered over the sound of jubilant snarling and shrieking. The things were swarming all over her now. She could feel them on her arms, her legs, across her stomach, even on her face. Everywhere they touched her burned like frosted metal on bare skin. More and more of them were passing through her body, chilling her bones. There was no adrenaline in her fear. Instead, terror weakened her. She had no power to battle on, to struggle against the unbeatable.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尽管他就在她的身边站着，但崔斯坦的声音却像是从非常遥远的地方传来。在群魔狂欢的咆哮和尖叫声中，他的声音几乎难以察觉。现在那些东西全都朝她一窝蜂扑过来。她能感到它们在自己的胳膊上和腿上，穿过她的肚子，甚至爬到她的脸上。它们触碰着她身体的各个部位，火辣辣的，就像结霜的金属贴在裸露的皮肤上一样。越来越多的黑影穿过她的身体，寒气入骨。现在恐惧感不会再让她情绪激动了，相反，恐惧感让她变得虚弱。她没有力气继续和这些无法击败的东西搏斗下去了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Her voice had less strength than a murmur. She felt weak all over, as if something had drained her of energy. It was hard to refuse the weight of the coaxing hands. Down, down, down, towards the ground, then, astonishingly, past it. The dirt and rock did not seem as solid as it should. Dylan felt she could slip through it as if it was liquid.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她的声音有气无力，如同在喉咙里嘟囔了一声。她感觉全身无比虚弱，就像是有人把自己的精力全都抽干了似的。那一双双手不达目的绝不罢休，现在很难拒绝它们拖拽的力量。朝着地面，往下，往下，往下，然后令人震惊的是，竟然穿过了地面。尘土和岩石似乎并不像它们看上去那么坚固。迪伦感觉自己可以穿过它们向下滑，好像它们是水做的一样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A hand grabbed the front of her jumper roughly. It hurt. The air around her was filled with angry hisses, and Dylan agreed -- the hand should stop. The fist shook harder and then yanked her upwards. She felt like she was trapped in a tug of war.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一只手从她正面粗暴地抓住了她的外衣，攥得她生疼。周围的空气中立刻充满了愤怒的嘶嘶声，那只手攥得很紧，然后把她向上提。她感觉自己像是陷入了一场拔河比赛中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She could hear a note of panic, and she wanted to comfort him. She felt almost calm, weightless and tranquil; he should be calm too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她能听出他语调里的恐惧，她想安慰他。现在她感觉自己几乎平静了下来，身子轻飘飘的，心里很安静。他也应该冷静下来了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The hissing intensified and the pulling hands transformed into ferocious talons, digging in like needles all over her body. They tore at her clothes and tangled into her hair, wrenching her head back and pulling a cry of pain from her lips. The unknown assailants seemed to enjoy that, and the hissing transformed into cackling, a menacing screech that drove straight into Dylan's heart and chilled it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="嘶嘶声越来越强烈，那一双双拉扯着她的手也变成了凶猛的利爪一般，像钢针一样扎在她身上。它们撕扯她的衣服，缠进她的头发里，把她的头硬扳过来，拽着她的嘴唇，疼得她直叫。这些不知名的凶手们似乎很享受这一切，而那嘶嘶声变成了咯咯的笑声，一种带着威胁的尖叫声直接钻进了迪伦的心脏，让她的心冷得战栗。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Suddenly Dylan was hauled upwards. The hand holding the front of her jumper pulled her upright and an arm snaked under her knees and lifted her into the air. Her feet dangled and her head lolled backwards until she could summon the strength to lift it. She knew she was in Tristan's arms. She didn't have time to be embarrassed, although he had her pinned tightly to his chest, shielding her, because the creatures had not given up the fight. They snapped at her feet and circled around Tristan. They grabbed at his clothes, his hair; slashed angrily in front of his face. Ignoring them, he held her tightly to him and began to run. The claws lost their grip, but they tried to grasp her again and again. Dylan could feel the air rushing past as the things whooshed around her; they were close enough to slash shallow gashes across her skin, but could not grip her as Tristan stormed down the hill towards the cabin.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然，迪伦被向上拖去。抓着她衣服正面的手把她往上提，一只胳膊绕到了她的膝盖下面，把她举向空中。她两脚悬在半空，头无力地靠在后面，直到攒足了劲才把头抬起来。他知道自己现在在崔斯坦的臂弯里。尽管他把她紧紧搂在胸口，护着她，她却没有时间来难为情，因为那些怪物没有死心。它们抓着她的脚，围着崔斯坦。它们扯着他的衣服和头发，愤怒地在他脸前连劈带砍。崔斯坦没有理会它们，他紧紧地拽着她开始疯跑。那些利爪一击不中，但仍一次次想要抓住他们。当它们飞快地移动包围她的时候，迪伦能感到呼啸而过的空气声。它们又靠近了，近到在她的皮肤上抓出了浅浅的伤口，但它们还是没有抓到她。崔斯坦正领着她飞奔下山朝小屋跑去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The cabin was incredibly close now. Tristan's feet thumped against a paved path as he flew across the final few metres. Not letting go of her, he somehow opened the door and dashed inside. The final thing Dylan heard was a thunderous chorus of screams. There were no words to hear, but the emotions were clear in their screeching clamour: they were furious.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在，小木屋已经近在咫尺了。崔斯坦飞快地跑过最后几米，脚撞在铺路石上发出砰砰声。他依然没有放开迪伦，打开门冲了进去。迪伦最后只听到怪叫声一齐响起，如同雷鸣。听不到它们说话，但是这一片刺耳的咆哮声中蕴含的情绪很明确：它们非常愤怒。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The screaming reached fever pitch as Tristan neared the shelter, as the things realised that they were about to lose their prey. They doubled their efforts, targeting Dylan as Tristan seemed impervious to their attacks. They scratched and tore at her, focusing on her head and her hair. Dylan tried to hide her face in Tristan's shoulder, seeking protection.</div>
