<div class="line_en">I don't mean that they had their tongues in their cheeks or did anything vulgar, for that was not one of their dangers: I do mean, on the other hand, that the element of the unnamed and untouched became, between us, greater than any other, and that so much avoidance could not have been so successfully effected without a great deal of tacit arrangement.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我并不是说他们话中带刺或者行为粗野，因为那并不是来自他们的威胁。我的意思是，在另一方面，我们之间那种不可名状、无法提及的因素比其他任何因素都更为突出，若非一系列的默契安排，就不可能顺利避开。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was not, I am as sure today as I was sure then, my mere infernal imagination: it was absolutely traceable that they were aware of my predicament and that this strange relation made, in a manner, for a long time, the air in which we moved.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我跟以前一样确信的是，这并不是我仅仅着了魔般的想象，这绝对是源于他们意识到了我的窘境，并且我们这种奇怪的关系在一定程度上，决定了相当长一段时间内我们相处的氛围。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was as if, at moments, we were perpetually coming into sight of subjects before which we must stop short, turning suddenly out of alleys that we perceived to be blind, closing with a little bang that made us look at each other -- for, like all bangs, it was something louder than we had intended -- the doors we had indiscreetly opened. All roads lead to Rome, and there were times when it might have struck us that almost every branch of study or subject of conversation skirted forbidden ground.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这就像我们时常会在谈到一些话题时戛然而止，突然转出我们认定的死胡同，随着关上门时，轻轻一声“砰”响，我们相互对视——因为，像所有“砰”的一声一样，这声音比我们意料的要响——那是我们曾不小心打开的门。条条大路通罗马，有时我们会突然发现，几乎每个学科或谈话主题都会涉及到禁忌话题。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There were days when I could have sworn that one of them had, with a small invisible nudge, said to the other: "She thinks she'll do it this time -- but she WON'T!" To "do it" would have been to indulge for instance -- and for once in a way -- in some direct reference to the lady who had prepared them for my discipline. They had a delightful endless appetite for passages in my own history, to which I had again and again treated them; they were in possession of everything that had ever happened to me, had had, with every circumstance the story of my smallest adventures and of those of my brothers and sisters and of the cat and the dog at home, as well as many particulars of the eccentric nature of my father, of the furniture and arrangement of our house, and of the conversation of the old women of our village.</div>

<div class="line_en">They pulled with an art of their own the strings of my invention and my memory; and nothing else perhaps, when I thought of such occasions afterward, gave me so the suspicion of being watched from under cover.

<div class="line_en">There was many a corner round which I expected to come upon Quint, and many a situation that, in a merely sinister way, would have favored the appearance of Miss Jessel. The summer had turned, the summer had gone; the autumn had dropped upon Bly and had blown out half our lights.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我总是期望能在某个拐角处与昆特不期而遇，走在凶险的路上时，我又经常期望能见到杰赛尔小姐。夏天转了下身，就离我们远去了，秋天来到了布莱，秋意吹熄了布莱半数的灯火。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The place, with its gray sky and withered garlands, its bared spaces and scattered dead leaves, was like a theater after the performance -- all strewn with crumpled playbills. There were exactly states of the air, conditions of sound and of stillness, unspeakable impressions of the KIND of ministering moment, that brought back to me, long enough to catch it, the feeling of the medium in which, that June evening out of doors, I had had my first sight of Quint, and in which, too, at those other instants, I had, after seeing him through the window, looked for him in vain in the circle of shrubbery.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="灰色的天空、枯萎的花环、空旷的野地和飘零的枯叶让这个地方看起来就像演出后的剧场，遍地洒满了皱巴巴的节目单。正是这种氛围、声响和静谧，这些不可言说的感受使我回想起了那执行任务的时刻——有足够的时间让我回想起——六月的那个夜晚，在户外的那种通灵的感觉，我第一次看到了昆特，还有另一次从窗户看到他后，我就绕着灌木丛徒劳地找他。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="我曾在谈话中跟格罗斯太太说起过，跟弗洛拉一起在湖边时那可怕的一幕——那样说使她迷惑不解——正是从那一刻开始，我的痛苦加深到难以自持的地步。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I had then expressed what was vividly in my mind: the truth that, whether the children really saw or not -- since, that is, it was not yet definitely proved -- I greatly preferred, as a safeguard, the fullness of my own exposure. I was ready to know the very worst that was to be known. What I had then had an ugly glimpse of was that my eyes might be sealed just while theirs were most opened.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着，我描述了我脑子里的清晰想法：事实是，不管孩子们看没看见幽灵——因为这还没有得到确切的证实——我愿意以保护者的身份面对整个事情。我做好了知道最坏情况的打算。我厌恶瞥见在他们睁大眼睛时，我的眼睛却被封闭了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The little wretches denied it with all the added volume of their sociability and their tenderness, in just the crystal depths of which -- like the flash of a fish in a stream -- the mockery of their advantage peeped up. The shock, in truth, had sunk into me still deeper than I knew on the night when, looking out to see either Quint or Miss Jessel under the stars, I had beheld the boy over whose rest I watched and who had immediately brought in with him -- had straightway, there, turned it on me -- the lovely upward look with which, from the battlements above me, the hideous apparition of Quint had played.</div>

<div class="line_en">I approached it from one side and the other while, in my room, I flung myself about, but I always broke down in the monstrous utterance of names. As they died away on my lips, I said to myself that I should indeed help them to represent something infamous, if, by pronouncing them, I should violate as rare a little case of instinctive delicacy as any schoolroom, probably, had ever known.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我在屋里踱来踱去，从各个方面接近突破口，但总是在说出那些可怕的名字时彻底崩溃。当这些名字在我嘴边消失时，我对自己说，我确实应该让它们成为一些丑恶的事情的代名词，这样，当我说出这些名字时，才能不亵渎教室这个无与伦比的神圣之地。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After these secret scenes I chattered more than ever, going on volubly enough till one of our prodigious, palpable hushes occurred -- I can call them nothing else -- the strange, dizzy lift or swim (I try for terms!) into a stillness, a pause of all life, that had nothing to do with the more or less noise that at the moment we might be engaged in making and that I could hear through any deepened exhilaration or quickened recitation or louder strum of the piano.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这些神秘的景象发生之后，我比以前更加喋喋不休，直到我们那异常的、明显的寂静来临——我无法用其他语言来形容——那奇异的、令人眩晕的起伏不定（我试图寻找措词！）陷入停滞，万物戛然而止。这与我们当时弄出多大的声响无关，透过热烈的欢呼、快速的背诵声、响亮而漫不经心的弹奏钢琴声，我仍能听到这让人窒息的静寂。">查看中文翻译</div>

Such things naturally left on the surface, for the time, a chill which we vociferously denied that we felt; and we had, all three, with repetition, got into such splendid training that we went, each time, almost automatically, to mark the close of the incident, through the very same movements.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was impossible to have given less encouragement than he had done to such a doctrine, but if we had not had the doctrine to fall back upon we should have deprived each other of some of our finest exhibitions. He never wrote to them -- that may have been selfish, but it was a part of the flattery of his trust of me; for the way in which a man pays his highest tribute to a woman is apt to be but by the more festal celebration of one of the sacred laws of his comfort; and I held that I carried out the spirit of the pledge given not to appeal to him when I let my charges understand that their own letters were but charming literary exercises.
