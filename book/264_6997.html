<div class="line_en">The Sheriff was a very unkind man. He treated the poor people very badly. He often took away all their money, and their houses and left them to starve. Sometimes, for a very little fault, he would cut off their ears or fingers. The poor people used to go into the wood, and Robin would give them food and money. Sometimes they went home again, but very often they stayed with him, and became his men.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他到达的时候，发现整个城市一片混乱。在那些日子里，商店非常少，因此大家通常到集市上去买卖。乡下人把黄油、鸡蛋和蜂蜜带到这里来卖。他们用卖得的钱买盘子、杯子、盆子和锅，获取他们需要的任何物品，然后带回到乡下去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">All sorts of people came to buy: fine ladies and poor women, rich knights and gentlemen, and poor workers, everyone pushing and crowding together.
