<div class="line_en">She ticked through the stack, counting ballots as she spoke. "It is like a quiz in that I don't want you conferring with one another. It's also like a quiz in that you have a limited amount of time." She slapped a set of ballots down on the first desk of row one, then went on to the second row. "I will collect them from you individually when the bell rings, and I will inspect to see that you have complied with the following instructions." She scooted over to row three. "Choose five, and only five, of the boys on the list. Do not put your name on it, and do not discuss your choices with your neighbors." She was on to row four now, talking faster and faster. "When you've made your selections, simply turn your sheet over." She slapped the remainder down on the last desk. "Do not, I repeat, do not fold your ballot!"</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="房间里充满了抱怨声和拖动文件夹的声音，而当我们大部分都服从了她的要求时，她把一叠明黄色的纸从桌上拿起来，带着邪恶的笑容扇着风，并说道：“到了为篮子男孩投票的时间了！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">All the guys around him muttered, "Not me," but Mrs. Simmons cleared her throat and said, "You should want to be one! It's a tradition that has helped support the school since it was founded. There have been generation after generation of basket boys helping make this campus what it is today. It's why we have flower beds. It's why we have shade trees and a grove of apple trees. Visit another junior high sometime and you'll begin to realize what a little oasis our campus really is."</div>

<div class="line_en">She'd give me detention, that's what. So with two minutes left to go, I put dots next to the boys I knew who weren't jerks or clowns, but were just nice. When I was through, there were all of ten names with dots, and of those I circled five: Ryan Noll, Vince Olson, Adrian Iglesias, Ian Lai, and Jon Trulock. They wouldn't make basket boy, but then I wouldn't be bidding, so it didn't really matter. At the bell I handed over my ballot and forgot all about the auction.</div>

<div class="line_en">The room fell quiet. And as I read down the list of over one hundred and fifty eighth-grade boys, I realized that to me, there had only ever been one boy. To me, there had only been Bryce.</div>
