<div class="line_en">Roberta Walls, the youngest D. S. in the toy department, paused just long enough in her midmorning flurry to whisper to Therese, "If we don't sell this twenty-four ninety-five suitcase today, it'll be marked down Monday and the department'll take a two-dollar loss!" Roberta nodded at the brown pasteboard suitcase on the counter, thrust her load of gray boxes into Miss Martucci's hands, and hurried on.</div>

<div class="line_en">Roberta flew up and down counters and from one corner of the floor to the other, from nine in the morning until six at night. Therese had heard that Roberta was trying for another promotion. She wore red harlequin glasses, and unlike the other girls, always pushed the sleeves of her green smock up above her elbows. Therese saw her flit across an aisle and stop Mrs. Hendrickson with an excited message delivered with gestures.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="罗柏塔奔走在柜台间，在这个楼层到处跑，从早上九点到晚上六点都是这样。特芮丝听说罗柏塔又想推动另一次促销活动了。她戴着像小丑一样的红色眼镜，而且和其他女孩不一样的是，她老是把绿色制服的袖子卷起来到手肘上面。特芮丝看到她敏捷地穿过走廊，拉住亨德里克森太太，激动地传达了某个讯息，还带着手势呢。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mrs. Hendrickson nodded agreement, Roberta touched her shoulder familiarly, and Therese felt a small start of jealousy. Jealousy, though she didn't care in the least for Mrs. Hendrickson, even disliked her.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="特芮丝看着那位中年女性，那女人的拐杖把她的肩膀撑得老高，她的脸和其他经过柜台人的脸都不一样，很柔和，眼中有一种万事了然于心的感觉，仿佛真的可以看透她所注视的事情。">查看中文翻译</div>

Therese went farther down the aisle, and was aware that the woman followed her on her crutches, circling the press of people at the counter, so as to save Therese walking back with the doll.

<div class="line_cn" title="“应该有。”特芮丝顺着走道往前去拿货，却发现那女人拄着拐杖跟着她，绕过挤在柜台前的人群，省得她带着娃娃走回来。突然之间，特芮丝希望无止境地努力下去，希望找到那个女人想要的娃娃。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But the next doll wasn't quite right, either. The doll didn't have real hair. Therese tried in another place and found the same doll with real hair.

<div class="line_en">"That's just perfect," the woman repeated. "I'm sending this to a friend in Australia who's a nurse. She graduated from nursing school with me, so I made a little uniform like ours to dress a doll in. Thank you so much. And I wish you a merry Christmas!"</div>

<div class="line_en">Therese hadn't had it. She got her pocketbook and the novel she was reading from the shelf under the wrapping counter. The novel was Joyce's Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, which Richard was anxious for her to read. How anyone could have read Gertrude Stein without reading any Joyce, Richard said, he didn't know. She felt a bit inferior when Richard talked with her about books. She had browsed all over the bookshelves at school, but the library assembled by the Order of St. Margaret had been far from catholic, she realized now, though it had included such unexpected writers as Gertrude Stein.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特芮丝还没有休息过。她从包装柜台下的架子里拿出笔记本和她正在读的小说。那本小说是乔伊斯的《一个青年艺术家的画像》，这是理查德一直叫她读的书。理查德说，他不知道怎么会有人读过格特鲁德·斯泰因的书，却没有读过乔伊斯的作品。理查德和她聊到书的时候，让她觉得有点自卑。她虽然在学校里读过不少书，但她现在才明白，学校里天主教圣玛加利会所负责的图书馆藏书范围其实和天主教关系并不深，里头还收藏了一些意想不到的作家作品，例如格特鲁德·斯泰因。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No smoking here!" shouted a man's voice, the very growly voice of an executive, and the girls ahead of Therese who had lighted cigarettes blew their smoke in the air and said loudly in chorus just before they reached the refuge of the women's room, "Who does he think he is, Mr. Frankenberg?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不准吸烟！”一个男人的声音大喊。那是一个主管快要大发雷霆的咆哮声。特芮丝前面那些抽烟的女孩把烟圈吹进空中，躲进女厕，一面还大声说：“他以为他是谁？法兰根堡先生？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A shipping cart skidded in front of her, and she struck her leg against its metal corner. She went on without looking down at her leg, though pain began to blossom there, like a slow explosion. She went on into the different chaos of women's voices, women's figures, and the smell of disinfectant. Blood was running to her shoe, and her stocking was torn in a jagged hole. She pushed some skin back into place, and feeling sickened, leaned against the wall and held to a water pipe. She stayed there a few seconds, listening to the confusion of voices among the girls at the mirror. Then she wet toilet paper and daubed until the red was gone from her stocking, but the red kept coming.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一台运货推车从她面前滑过去，她的脚撞到推车的金属边。她继续往前走，并没有往下看自己的脚，疼痛开始加剧，好像一场缓慢的爆炸。她继续走入混乱的场面中，里面充斥着女人的声音，还有女性身体及消毒水的味道。血流到她的鞋子上，她的袜子撕开了个不规则的破洞。她把破掉的皮肤压回去，觉得不太舒服，靠着墙，握住一根水管。她在那里待了一会儿，听着镜子旁那些女孩子杂乱的声音。然后她沾湿卫生纸擦拭袜子，直到红色的痕迹消失。但血一直冒出来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="最后，没有什么办法可想了，只好从贩卖机里买一条卫生棉。她用了卫生棉里面的棉花，拿纱布绑在脚上。然后，该回柜台上班了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Their eyes met at the same instant, Therese glancing up from a box she was opening, and the woman just turning her head so she looked directly at Therese. She was tall and fair, her long figure graceful in the loose fur coat that she held open with a hand on her waist. Her eyes were gray, colorless, yet dominant as light or fire, and caught by them, Therese could not look away. She heard the customer in front of her repeat a question, and Therese stood there, mute. The woman was looking at Therese, too, with a preoccupied expression as if half her mind were on whatever it was she meant to buy here, and though there were a number of salesgirls between them, Therese felt sure the woman would come to her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她们的眼睛同时交会，特芮丝从她正在打开的盒子抬头往上看，那个女人正好转过头来，直接看着特芮丝。她高挑美丽，修长的身子优雅地穿着一件开襟毛外套，一只手插在腰上。她的眼睛是灰色的，虽没有散发出光泽，却睥睨一切，仿佛打了光或着了火一样，令特芮丝目不转睛。她听到前面的客人正重复问着一个问题，但特芮丝就站在那里，一言不发。那女人也用一种着了迷的表情看着特芮丝，仿佛只有一半的思绪是放在她想买的东西上。虽然两人间还有好几个售货小姐，特芮丝还是很肯定她会走向自己。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Her eyebrows were blond, curving around the bend of her forehead. Her mouth was as wise as her eyes, Therese thought, and her voice was like her coat, rich and supple, and somehow full of secrets.</div>

Then why can't we see each other again? Why can't we even have lunch together today?" Her voice was so casual and she might have said it so easily.

<div class="line_en">In the middle of the afternoon, she went down to the first floor and bought a card in the greeting-card department. It was not a very interesting card, but at least it was simple, in plain blue and gold. She stood with the pen poised over the card, thinking of what she might have written -- "You are magnificent" or even "I love you" -- finally writing quickly the excruciatingly dull and impersonal: "Special salutations from Frankenberg's." She added her number 645-A in lieu of a signature. Then she went down to the post office in the basement, hesitated at the letter drop, losing her nerve suddenly at the sight of her hand holding the letter half in the slot. What would happen? She was going to leave the store in a few days, anyway. What would Mrs. H. F. Aird care? The blond eyebrows would perhaps lift a little, she would look at the card a moment, then forget it. Therese dropped it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="午后三四点，她走下一楼，在卡片部买了张问候卡片。卡片本身没什么特色，样式很简单，上面是朴素的蓝色和金色。她拿着笔站着，笔尖停留在卡片上，思考着该写什么——“你很棒”，或甚至“我爱你”——最后很快地写下平淡乏味的一行字：“来自法兰根堡的特别致意。”她在签名处加上她的员工编号六四五A，然后走到地下层的邮局，却在邮筒前犹豫了起来。看到自己的手握着已经一半塞进邮筒口里的信，她突然慌张了起来。寄过去的话会发生什么事？反正她再过几天就要离职了。H·G·爱尔德太太会不会在乎呢？那对金黄色的眉毛或许会稍微扬起，她或许会看一会儿那张卡片，然后就把它置之脑后。特芮丝把卡片投进邮筒。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And Therese turned to the next customer. She worked with an indefatigable patience, but her figures on the sales slips bore faint tails where the pencil jerked convulsively. She went to Mr. Logan's office, which seemed to take hours, but when she looked at the clock, only fifteen minutes had passed, and now it was time to wash up for lunch. She stood stiffly in front of the rotating towel, drying her hands, feeling unattached to anything or anyone, isolated. Mr. Logan had asked her if she wanted to stay on after Christmas. She could have a job downstairs in the cosmetic department. Therese had said no.</div>

<div class="line_en">On the way home, an idea came to her for a stage set, a house interior with more depth than breadth, with a kind of vortex down the center, from which rooms would go off on either side. She wanted to begin the cardboard model that night, but at last she only elaborated on her pencil sketch of it. She wanted to see someone -- not Richard, not Jack or Alice Kelly downstairs, maybe Stella, Stella Overton, the stage designer she had met during her first weeks in New York. Therese had not seen her, she realized, since she had come to the cocktail party Therese had given before she left her other apartment. Stella was one of the people who didn't know where she lived now. Therese was on her way down to the telephone in the hall, when she heard the short quick rings of her doorbell that meant there was a call for her.</div>
