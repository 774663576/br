<div class="line_en">The deception could not continue after this; and an explanationimmediately took place, by which both gained considerable amusement forthe moment, without any material loss of happiness to either, for Mrs. Jennings only exchanged one form of delight for another, and stillwithout forfeiting her expectation of the first.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Aye, aye, the parsonage is but a small one," said she, after the firstebullition of surprise and satisfaction was over, "and very likely MAYbe out of repair; but to hear a man apologising, as I thought, for ahouse that to my knowledge has five sitting rooms on the ground-floor, and I think the housekeeper told me could make up fifteen beds! -- and toyou too, that had been used to live in Barton cottage! -- It seems quiteridiculous.
