<div class="line_en">It was at this point that I had the bright idea of stopping over in Rome where I had to change planes. I had a beatific vision of a quiet, cool room with fresh, slightly starched sheets. The shade of a leafy tree would fall on the bed; there might well be a calming fountain.</div>

<div class="line_en">Most air journeys are nasty, brutish and long. The final stage of my fieldwork was made even more so by the fact that I was obliged to sit bolt upright, sipping like a maiden aunt from a bottle of Vichy water, all attention focused on my heaving stomach while something like a French "Carry On" film was played at high volume for my delectation. The Sahara slipped away below.</div>

<div class="line_en">Once on the ground, I found that I could no longer carry my luggage and was obliged to deposit it in the left-luggage office. I watched my precious field notes and camera disappear into its gaping maw with a sceptical disbelief in their reappearance and in my lunacy at parting with them. Gripped firmly in my hand was my somewhat travel-soiled wardrobe. The trousers given me by my local missionary's wife attracted the curious stares of the elegant Romans. My wild-eyed and haggard look led carabinieri to follow me with their gaze.</div>

<div class="line_en">I found my room. It was hot and noisy; all the lights buzzed; the price was obscene. This seemed about the right relationship between the desired and the attained. I settled down to sleep.</div>

<div class="line_en">Having been warned repeatedly that I would quite inevitably be robbed, beaten and looted on the streets, I had been at pains to have only enough money on me to cover the cost of ham sandwiches. Perhaps it was no surprise to find on returning to my buzzing hotel room that the door had been levered from its hinges and all my possessions carried off: air-ticket, passport, money, even the remnants of my Dowayo wardrobe had vanished without trace. The management were adamant about their lack of responsibility. My West African abilities to rage and scream were greatly admired but left the situation unchanged. A quick survey of the one intact pocket in my outfit revealed that I had about a pound in the world. In such circumstances, the next move is quite obvious. I went to a café and, dispensing with ham sandwiches, ordered a beer and reflected on my plight. The proprietor was huge and quizzical. He established my nationality, my occupation, my marital status. He showed me a well-thumbed photograph of his large and much-loved brood. He had, he revealed, been a prisoner of war in Wales. The girls there, he affirmed bashfully, had been very passionate. Soon I was telling him all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="人们老是警告我在罗马免不了被抢、被打、惨遭当街劫掠，我特地只带足够买火腿三明治的钱。或许我对接下来的际遇不该吃惊，返回灯泡嗡嗡作响的旅馆房间，我发现门上铰链被撬开，东西被洗劫一空：飞机票、护照、钱，甚至我从多瓦悠带回来的衣物也都不翼而飞。旅馆人员坚称他们不负行李保管责任，我的西非式愤怒尖叫能力虽令他们钦佩，却于事无补。我火速检查口袋，全身只余一英镑。这种情形下，下一步很明显。我走进餐馆，省略火腿三明治，直接点了一杯啤酒，哀悼我的不幸。餐馆主人是个壮硕古怪的人，摸清我的国籍、职业、婚姻状态后，拿出一张翻到破烂的照片，上面是他的大群可爱孩子。他说曾在威尔斯做过战俘，略带腼腆说威尔斯女孩非常热情。不久，我也对他倾吐遭遇。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One of the least appreciated differences between an African village and a European city is in the passage of time. To one used to the regular pulse of farming life, where one thinks in seasons and the days have no names, urban dwellers seem to flash past in a frenzy of frustrated endeavour. I paced the streets of Rome like a Dowayo sorcerer whose unearthly slowness sets off his ritual role from everyday activities. Café menus offered so many possibilities that I felt unable to cope: the absence of choice in Do-wayoland had led to a total inability to make decisions. In the field, I had dreamed endlessly of orgiastic eating; now I lived on ham sandwiches.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一般人较少注意非洲村落与欧洲城市的最大差别在时间的流逝。对习惯农居生活规律节奏、脑袋里只有季节而不知今夕何夕的人而言，都市住民似乎以一种挫折疯狂的营营碌碌呼啸而过。漫步罗马街头，我觉得自己就像多瓦悠巫师，神秘的缓慢速度标示出我的仪式角色与身旁日常活动的差异。小餐馆的菜色太多，我无力应付：多瓦悠生活的别无选择使我失去决定能力。还在多瓦悠时，我成日幻想狂吃痛饮，眼前，却点了火腿三明治。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"So," he summed up in an odd Romano-Celtic accent, "you have no money, no ticket, no identification." I agreed. "Then I lend you ten thousand lire." He slapped some notes on the bar. I ordered a ham sandwich. In my bemused state, such incredible generosity seemed no more unreasonable than the disaster that preceded it. I was back in fieldwork gear.</div>

<div class="line_en">My benefactor rang the British Embassy while I demurred at further involvement with such persons, picturing an endless tour of Rome in search of stamped documents that would be plucked from my grasp by ragazzi before I could attain the plane. It was all arranged. First, I must go to the police to make a statement, then the Embassy would arrange for me to be repatriated. The very word seemed to imply shipment home in chains.</div>

<div class="line_en">At the police station were assembled a vast horde of outraged, despairing and desolate tourists of all nationalities who had, it seemed, suffered the harsh attentions of Roman youth. The British, for some reason, were patiently sorted by a bored and indifferent policeman and placed in the same room as the Germans. The French were assigned, we noted with rage, a room that was both larger and cooler. A man with a strong Bradford accent addressed us all. "It were Beryl I felt sorry for," he announced. "That's my wife." He indicated a demure matron in tweed. "She couldn't leave the camp site but they thought she were on the game. Men coming up to her, honking their horns. She had to throw plums at one bloke." We regarded her speculatively. "Then these two young fellers come up behind us on their motorbike, broke the window of the car at the back with a hammer and carried off us luggage like we wasn't there."</div>

<div class="line_en">Another officer appeared and, without explanation, deposited a wild-eyed, implausibly hirsute man in chains in the chair across from mine and departed. The man leaned forward and fixed me with a crazed stare. We both knew that the moment I looked away he would be at my throat. He stared at me. I stared back. Neither spoke. After an eternity my policeman reappeared, ignored the hirsute manaclee and handed me a statement to sign. The elegant Italian was not hard to comprehend. It declared roundly that I had been robbed of £1000 at the railway station. Feeling that I had been schooled to sterner stuff than this, I blithely signed.</div>

I shall telephone your parents." The debauched waif sniffed. "They don't care do they?" The consular officer compressed her lips in prim disapproval. "Who was it this time?"

<div class="line_en">A paradox that has much exercised mathematicians is that of the Einsteinian space traveller. Having journeyed at great speed for several months around the universe, he returns to Earth to find that whole decades have passed. The anthropological traveller is in the reverse position. He goes away for what seems an inordinately long period to other worlds, ponders cosmic problems, ages greatly. When he returns, only a few months have elapsed. The acorn he planted has not become a great tree; it has scarcely had time to put forth a tentative shoot. His children have not grown to adulthood; only his closest friends have noticed he has been away at all.</div>

<div class="line_en">After months of isolation, polite conversation is extraordinarily hard. Long silences are taken as brooding displeasure while people in the street react quite badly to the sight of a man quite openly talking to himself. Adjusting to the rules of interaction also poses problems. When the milkman left unordered milk on the step one day my reaction was to race after him shouting and raging after the West African fashion. I believe I may even have seized him by the collar. The poor man was greatly discountenanced. By West African rales I was merely being firm, by English rules an insufferable lout.

The finest moment of the day was waking up with a start and feeling a warm flood of relief to be no longer in Africa. My notebooks lay neglected on the desk; I felt a deep revulsion to even touching them which lasted for months.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was strange to see the trunk that had once stood in my hut lying in a dank, cold shed in London. Its shape had been completely transformed. On dispatch it had been rectangular; now it was almost wholly spherical. Large boot marks on the lid attested to the agent that had worked this wonder. I had to prise off the lid with a tyre lever. It is always odd to receive a package from oneself: it smacks of split personality, especially when the person who sent it is so rapidly becoming alien to him who receives it. My friends without exception admired the elegant simplicity of the pots. What a pity I had spoiled them by using them; could I not have bought some cheap imported pans and saved these as too beautiful to use? It would have been nice to introduce them to Zuuldibo and let them fight it out. The returned fieldworker accepts both positions, identifies with neither.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="看到这个一度放在我茅屋里的行李柜，此刻躺在伦敦的湿冷车库里，实在很怪。它完全变形。托运时，它是长方形的，现在几乎变成圆形。箱上的巨大皮靴印证实经手者将它变成这等神奇模样。我必须用装胎杠杆才能撬开盖子。接到自己寄的包裹本来就是奇怪经验，微带一种人格分裂的味道，尤其寄件的我对收件的我而言，已经逐渐变成陌生人。我的朋友一致赞美这些陶器的优美简朴造型。太可惜了，我干嘛拿它们去煮东西，我不能买些便宜进口盆盘，保留这些美得不该拿来用的东西吗？将我这些朋友介绍给祖帝保，让他们的不同观点大打一架，可能不错。返乡的田野工作者可以接受这两种不同立场，一个也不必认同。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One of the strangest psychological experiences was the arrival of the trunk of pots that I had dispatched what seemed like months before. I had wrapped them carefully in Dowayo cloth and packed them in a metal cabin trunk plastered with stickers declaring the fragility of the contents in four languages. Zuuldibo had been appalled at such meanness. Why did I not give them to the villagers? It was known that I was quite rich enough, like the woman who made the pots themselves, to buy gaudy enamelware from Nigeria. My wives would surely not be pleased when I handed them pottery from a village.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最奇怪的心理经验是目睹我数个月前从非洲寄出的瓦瓮抵达。当初，我细心用多瓦悠布匹包裹它们，装在铁制行李柜里，上面贴了四种语言的“易碎物品”警语标志。祖帝保震惊于我的鄙俗。我干嘛不把它们送给村民？大家都知道我很有钱，几乎和那些制陶的女人一样富有，大可购买尼日利亚产的富丽搪瓷器。我的老婆看到我带回村落瓦瓮，可不会太高兴。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It is impossible, of course, at such moments not to try to draw up a balance sheet of profit and loss. I had certainly learnt a lot about a small and relatively unimportant people of West Africa. Finishing fieldwork is always a matter of definition, not of fact. It would have been quite possible to go on for another five years in Dowayoland, albeit with diminishing returns, without exhausting the scope of a project aimed at "understanding" a people so different from ourselves. But more general competences always lie beneath the particular. Henceforth I was to find that the monographs of which anthropology as a subject is composed would appear to me in quite different light I would be able to feel which passages were deliberately vague, evasive, forced, where data were inadequate or irrelevant in a way that had been impossible before Dowayoland. All this makes the work of other anthropologists more available than it had ever been before. I also felt that in attempting to understand the Dowayo view of the world I had tested the relevance of certain very general models of interpretation and cultural symbolism. On the whole they had stood up pretty well and I felt much happier about their place in the scheme of things.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此刻，你不可能不评估此行损益。我当然学知了西非洲某个无足轻重小民族的许多事情。田野工作的完成与否完全是定义问题而非事实认定。我可以继续待在多瓦悠五年，获致微小的研究成果，却仍无法穷尽“了解一个全然陌生民族”的研究目标。但是想要获得特殊成就，总要有一般能力做基础。现在我阅读人类学文献有全然不同的眼光，能察觉某些句子是刻意模糊、逃避或者勉强，也能察觉某些资料不恰当或无关。若非去了多瓦悠，我不可能有此能力。我的研究也让其他有兴趣的人类学者工作起来较轻松。我甚至认为我在解开多瓦悠宇宙观上的成果，验证了某些常用的解释模型与文化象征间的关连。整体而言，我的研究结论颇站得住脚，我很满意它们在整体人类学的地位。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Purely personally, there had also been great changes. In common with many other fieldworkers, my health had been shattered for some time to come. My vague liberal faith in the ultimate cultural and economic salvation of the Third World had received a sharp knock. It is a common trait of returned fieldworkers, as they stumble around their own culture with the clumsiness of returned astronauts, to be simply uncritically grateful to be a Westerner, living in a culture that seems suddenly very precious and vulnerable; I was no exception. But there is something insidiously habit-forming in anthropological fieldwork. The ethnographic hangover is no more effective as aversion therapy than any other. Several weeks after my return I phoned the friend whose conversation had sent me to the field in the first place.</div>
