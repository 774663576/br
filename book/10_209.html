<div class="line_en">Now we will return to Bilbo and the dwarves. All night one of them had watched, but when morning came they had not heard or seen any sign of danger. But ever more thickly the birds were gathering. Their companies came flying from the South; and the crows that still lived about the Mountain were wheeling and crying unceasingly above.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Something strange is happening," said Thorin. "The time has gone for the autumn wanderings; and these are birds that dwell always in the land; there are starlings and flocks of finches; and far off there are many carrion birds as if a battle were afoot!"</div>

Now I am the chief of the great ravens of the Mountain. We are few, but we remember still the king that was of old.

Already a host of the elves is on the way, and carrion birds are with them hoping for battle and slaughter. By the lake men murmur that their sorrows are due to the dwarves; for they are homeless and many have died, and Smaug has destroyed their town.

Also I would beg of you, if any of you are still young and strong of wing, that you would send messengers to our kin in the mountains of the North, both west from here and east, and tell them of our plight.

<div class="line_cn" title="“食物也没有多少！”比尔博喊道，他在这些地方一向很实际。他觉得不过分地说，这场冒险已经随着恶龙的死亡而结束了——在这一点上他可是大错特错了——他宁愿放弃自己大部分应得的报酬，换取一切有个和平的收场。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As you have heard some of the events already, you will see that the dwarves still had some days before them. They explored the caverns once more, and found, as they expected, that only the Front Gate remained open; all the other gates (except, of course, the small secret door) had long ago been broken and blocked by Smaug, and no sign of them remained. So now they began to labour hard in fortifying the main entrance, and in making a new path that led from it. Tools were to be found in plenty that the miners and quarriers and builders of old had used; and at such work the dwarves were still very skilled.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="由于有些事情你们已经听说了，所以你们知道，矮人们其实还有几天的时间作准备。他们仔细检查了大小洞穴，发现果然如同他们所预料的那样，只有正门还是开着的，所有别的门（当然，那个小密门除外）都早已被史矛革要么破坏要么封锁了，连一点痕迹都没有剩下。因此，他们开始努力加强正门的防御工事，并重新修建一条从地下宫殿通往外面的道路。工具能找到很多，那是古代的矿工、采石工和建筑工们所使用过的，矮人们对于这些工作依旧十分在行。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As they worked the ravens brought them constant tidings. In this way they learned that the Elvenking had turned aside to the Lake, and they still had a breathing space. Better still, they heard that three of their ponies had escaped and were wandering wild far down the banks of the Running River, not far from where the rest of their stores had been left. So while the others went on with their work, Fili and Kili were sent, guided by a raven, to find the ponies and bring back all they could.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在他们工作的同时，渡鸦也不停地给他们带来新消息。他们靠着这样的方式，知道了精灵国王把部队转向带到了湖边，这样他们就有了喘息之机。更利好的消息是，他们听说他们原先的小马中有三匹逃过了史矛革的追捕，现在正在奔流河的河岸附近乱跑，距离他们剩余的补给品被留下的地方并没有多远。因此，当其他人忙着手上活儿的时候，菲力和奇力由一只渡鸦领着，被派去寻找小马，并尽可能地把补给品带回来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They were four days gone, and by that time they knew that the joined armies of the Lake-men and the Elves were hurrying toward the Mountain. But now their hopes were higher; for they had food for some weeks with care-chiefly cram, of course, and they were very tired of it; but cram is much better than nothing-and already the gate was blocked with a wall of squared stones laid dry, but very thick and high, across the opening. There were holes in the wall through which they could see (or shoot), but no entrance. They climbed in or out with ladders, and hauled stuff up with ropes. For the issuing of the stream they had contrived a small low arch under the new wall; but near the entrance they had so altered the narrow bed that a wide pool stretched from the mountain-wall to the head of the fall over which the stream went towards Dale. Approach to the Gate was now only possible, without swimming, along a narrow ledge of the cliff, to the right as one looked outwards from the wall. The ponies they had brought only to the head of the steps above the old bridge, and unloading them there had bidden them return to their masters and sent them back riderless to the South.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="时间又过去了四天，那时他们已经知道长湖镇人类和精灵的联军正快速向孤山行进着。但现在他们对未来的希望反而更加高涨，因为他们的食物只要分配得当，够撑好几星期的——当然，主要是克拉姆，他们都已经吃腻了，可是总比什么都没有要好很多——而且大门已经被一座由方正岩石砌起的高墙给封闭了起来，墙壁又厚又高，横亘在正门前方，上面有孔，他们可以观察（或发射弓箭），但外面的人却进不来。他们利用梯子进出高墙，用绳子吊运货物，在墙的下部开了个小小的拱形出口，供河水往外流。但在靠近进口的地方，他们改变了狭窄的河道，使得一个宽阔的水潭一直从山墙延伸到了河流倾泻入谷地的瀑布源头。现在，如果不游泳想要接近大门的话，只有沿着一道悬崖上凿出来的狭窄小径，位于从高墙上望出去的右侧。他们找回来的小马只能来到旧桥上方的台阶尽头，在那里卸下所有补给之后，他们就让小马回到主人那里去，然后再空着马背被送去南边。">查看中文翻译</div>

From behind their wall they watched them come up to the valley's head and climb slowly up. Before long they could see that both men of the lake armed as if for war and elvish bowmen were among them. At length the foremost of these climbed the tumbled rocks and appeared at the top of the falls; and very great was their surprise to see the pool before them and the Gate blocked with a wall of new-hewn stone.</div>

<div class="line_en">But they answered nothing. Some turned swiftly back, and the others after gazing for a while at the Gate and its defences soon followed them. That day the camp was moved to the east of the river, right between the arms of the Mountain. The rocks echoed then with voices and with song, as they had not done for many a day. There was the sound, too, of elven-harps and of sweet music; and as it echoed up towards them it seemed that the chill of the air was warmed, and they caught faintly the fragrance of woodland flowers blossoming in spring.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对方并没有回答。有些人马上掉转身就走了，其他人则盯着大门及其防御看了一会儿，也跟着走了。部队的营地当天就移到了河的东侧，就在大山的两道支脉之间。岩壁间随即回响起了谈笑声和歌声，这是他们好久没有做过的事情了。其间还夹杂着精灵的竖琴和甜美的音乐，当这些美妙的音乐向他们飘来时，仿佛凛冽的寒气也跟着温暖起来，他们还依稀闻到了森林中的花朵在春日里绽放的香气。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Now these were fair words and true, if proudly and grimly spoken; and Bilbo thought that Thorin would at once admit what justice was in them. He did not, of course, expect that any one would remember that it was he who discovered all by himself the dragon's weak spot; and that was just as well, for no one ever did. But also he did not reckon with the power that gold has upon which a dragon has long brooded, nor with dwarvish hearts. Long hours in the past days Thorin had spent in the treasury, and the lust of it was heavy on him. Though he had hunted chiefly for the Arkenstone, yet he had an eye for many another wonderful thing that was lying there, about which were wound old memories of the labours and the sorrows of his race.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="即使说得有点高傲和严厉，但话却是在理而且一点不假的。比尔博以为索林会立刻承认对方说得有道理。当然，他根本不指望会有人记得是他单枪匹马凭借一己之力发现了恶龙的弱点。他这么想很对，因为的确没有人记得了。但他也忽略了被恶龙盘踞已久的黄金所具有的蛊惑力，也没考虑到矮人们的心灵。在过去的几天中，索林长时间置身于宝藏中，因此宝藏在他心中撩起了浓厚的欲望。虽然他主要是在寻找阿肯宝钻，但他对放在那里的其他许多好东西还是看在眼里的，这些都勾起了他对族人所付出血汗的伤痛记忆。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You put your worst cause last and in the chief place," Thorin answered. "To the treasure of my people no man has a claim, because Smaug who stole it from us also robbed him of life or home. The treasure was not his that his evil deeds should be amended with a share of it. The price of the goods and the assistance that we received of the Lake-men we will fairly pay-in due time. But nothing will we give, not even a loaf's worth, under threat of force. While an armed host lies before our doors, we look on you as foes and thieves.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你把最糟糕的理由放在最后也是最主要的位置，”索林回答道，“没有人有资格分享我的族人的宝藏，因为夺走这些宝藏的史矛革也同样夺走了他们的生命和家园。这宝藏不属于他，因此他的恶行也不该以分享宝藏的方式来弥补。长湖镇的人们给予我们的物资与协助，我们在适当的时候会给予优厚的回报。但是，在武力的威胁下，我们什么都不会给，哪怕只是一条面包的钱！只要你们还陈兵于我们的门前，我们就将你们看作敌人和小偷。">查看中文翻译</div>
