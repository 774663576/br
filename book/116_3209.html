<div class="line_en">The two Miss Osbornes were rather proud young ladies. They did not think Amelia was good enough for their handsome brother, and they did not treat her kindly. "What can George see in that dull little creature?" they asked each other.</div>

<div class="line_en">And what has happened to Amelia Sedley during this time? While Rebecca was working so hard to make her future safe with the Crawley family, her dear friend Amelia had nothing to do but to sit in her comfortable home, with loving parents, and wait for George Osborne's visits.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那么这段时间里，阿梅莉亚·塞德利那边又发生了什么事呢？在丽贝卡处心积虑确保自己在克劳利家族占有一席之地的时候，她亲爱的朋友阿梅莉亚却无所事事，只能和慈爱的双亲待在舒适的家中，等待乔治·奥斯本的拜访。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Unfortunately, these visits were not at all frequent. George was often with his regiment down in Kent, and when he was in London, he seemed to have so many other things to do, so many friends to see, so many games of cards to play. Amelia saw more of his sisters, Miss Jane Osborne and Miss Maria Osborne, since the Osbornes' home was just the other side of Russell Square.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不幸的是，他的拜访一点儿都不频繁。乔治常常随军团驻扎肯特，而当他在伦敦的时候，似乎总有很多别的事要处理，很多朋友要拜访，很多牌局要参加。阿梅莉亚见乔治的姐妹——简·奥斯本小姐和玛丽亚·奥斯本小姐——次数更多，因为奥斯本家就在拉塞尔广场的另一头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So Amelia sat at home, waiting for George, and worrying about Napoleon Bonaparte and the talk of war. She had heard reports that George's regiment would be sent to France to fight Napoleon's army, and the thought terrified her. She asked Dobbin about it when he visited the Sedleys one day. No orders had yet been received, Dobbin told her gently. He was very upset to see Amelia so unhappy and so neglected by George.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因此，阿梅莉亚就待在家中，一边等乔治来访，一边担心拿破仑·波拿巴的动向和有关战争的传言。她听说乔治所属的军团会被派去法国，对抗拿破仑的军队。一想到这个，她就十分害怕。一天，多宾来拜访塞德利一家，她向他询问此事。目前尚未接到命令，多宾温柔地告诉她。见到阿梅莉亚这么不开心，这么被乔治冷落，多宾不由得心烦意乱。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">These letters became quite a joke with George's friends in the regiment. On one occasion George was seen lighting his cigar with one of them, to the horror of Captain Dobbin, who would have very much liked to receive such a letter himself. In fact, Dobbin was so angry that he could remain silent no longer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这些信成了乔治军团里的朋友们的笑柄。有一次，乔治用其中一封信点雪茄，这一行为让多宾上尉大为惊恐，他自己是多么希望能收到这样的一封信啊。事实上，多宾太生气了，他无法再继续保持沉默。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="时间一天天过去，乔治还是没来拜访，可怜又心肠软的阿梅莉亚却一直满怀期待与信任。她全心全意地爱着乔治·奥斯本，每天都给他写信——长长的书信，虽然信写得不太好，但字里行间充满了爱意——深情、不加批判、深信不疑的爱。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">No more than four months later, Mr Osborne's words to his son were proved true. Old John Sedley was a ruined man. He had judged badly and lost money, and could not recover from his mistakes. The final disaster struck when Napoleon escaped from the island of Elba and invaded France. The money market crashed, taking with it what remained of Mr Sedley's fortune. The family had to leave their fine home in Russell Square, and all the contents of the house were put up for sale.</div>

<div class="line_en">On the day of the sale, who should visit the house in Russell Square but our old friends, Captain and Mrs Rawdon Crawley? Rebecca had seen her dear friend Amelia a few times since she had been at Miss Crawley's house. Amelia and George Osborne visited her, and Rawdon invited George several times to little gambling parties, which George always accepted, happy to lose money to the son of a baronet and his high-society friends.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="拍卖那天，除了我们的老朋友克劳利上尉夫妇，谁还会到拉塞尔广场的这座宅子拜访呢？自从到克劳利小姐家之后，丽贝卡见过她亲爱的朋友阿梅莉亚几次。阿梅莉亚和乔治·奥斯本拜访过她，罗顿也几次邀请乔治参加小型赌博聚会。乔治每次都接受邀请，乐意输钱给这位准男爵的儿子和他上流社会的朋友们。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When they arrived in Russell Square, Rebecca was shocked to see a sale at the house where she had once been treated so kindly. However, this did not stop her from trying to buy Amelia's piano, though it is not clear why she wanted it. Perhaps her own piano had been sold in order to pay the rent.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们到达拉塞尔广场时，丽贝卡震惊地发现，她曾经受到极好招待的地方正在举行拍卖。然而，这并不妨碍她试图买下阿梅莉亚的钢琴，虽然我们并不清楚她想要这架钢琴的原因。也许是她为了付房租已经把自己的钢琴拿去卖掉了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">About a month after Becky had set up home with Rawdon, she expressed a wish to see Amelia again. Money being short in the Crawleys' little home, and with no sign of forgiveness from Miss Crawley, Rawdon agreed that it would be good to see George Osborne again. "I'd like to play a few more games of cards with him. He'd be what I call useful just now," he said, with his loud soldier's laugh. Rawdon Crawley had no intention of cheating George Osborne, of course; it was just rather convenient to gamble with someone less skilful than himself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="贝姬和罗顿安家落户后一个月左右，她表达了想再见到阿梅莉亚的愿望。克劳利夫妇小家庭正资金短缺，克劳利小姐又没有原谅他们的迹象，罗顿也认为再见见乔治·奥斯本是件好事。“我想再和他多玩几把牌。按我的说法，现在就是他‘派上 用场 ’的时候了。”他一边说着，一边以军人的大嗓门笑了起来。当然，罗顿·克劳利没打算欺诈乔治·奥斯本，只不过和牌技不如自己的人赌博可省事多了。">查看中文翻译</div>

He had just been made a captain, and he was enjoying trying on his fine new uniform. That evening he went to see his father, who told him again that there could be no marriage with Amelia -- and gave George a large amount of money to pay for his new clothes.
