<div class="line_en">Initially, each listening post had several hundred listeners, but as technology advanced, there was only one person on duty. Being a listener was a humble career. Though they lived in listening posts that were kept at a constant temperature, with support systems that guaranteed their survival without requiring them to dehydrate during Chaotic Eras, they also had to live their lives within the narrow confines of these tiny spaces. The amount of joy they got from Stable Eras was far less than others got.</div>

<div class="line_en">This was the loneliest time. In the deep silence of midnight, the universe revealed itself to its listeners as a vast desolation. What the listener of Post 1379 disliked the most was seeing the waves that slowly crawled across the display, a visual record of the meaningless noise the listening post picked up from space. He felt this interminable wave was an abstract view of the universe: one end connected to the endless past, the other to the endless future, and in the middle only the ups and downs of random chance -- without life, without pattern, the peaks and valleys at different heights like uneven grains of sand, the whole curve like a one-dimensional desert made of all the grains of sand lined up in a row: lonely, desolate, so long that it was intolerable. You could follow it and go forward or backward as long as you liked, but you'd never find the end.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是最孤寂的时刻，在静静的午夜，宇宙向它的聆听者展示着广漠的荒凉。1379号监听员最不愿意看的，就是显示器上缓缓移动的那条曲线，那是监听系统接收到的宇宙电波的波形，无意义的噪声。他感到这条无限长的线就是宇宙的抽象，一头连着无限的过去，另一头连着无限的未来，中间只有为无规律无生命的随机起伏。一个个高低错落的波峰就像一粒粒大小不等的沙子，整条线就像是所有沙粒排成行形成的一维沙漠，荒凉寂寥，长得令人无法忍受。你可以沿着它向前向后走无限远，但永远找不到归宿。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The listener at Post 1379 looked through the tiny window at the world of Trisolaris outside. This was a Chaotic Era night. The giant moon had not yet risen, and most people remained in dehydrated hibernation. Even plants had instinctively dehydrated and turned into lifeless bundles of dry fiber lying against the ground. Under the starlight, the ground looked like a giant sheet of cold metal.</div>

<div class="line_en">On this day, however, the listener saw something odd when he glanced at the waveform display. Even experts had a hard time telling with the naked eye whether a waveform carried information. But the listener was so familiar with the noise of the universe that he could tell that the wave that now moved in front of his eyes had something extra. The thin curve, rising and falling, seemed to possess a soul. He was certain that the radio signal before him had been modulated by intelligence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但今天，当监听员扫了一眼波形显示后，发现有些异样。即使是专业人员，也很难仅凭肉眼看出波形是否携带信息，但监听员对宇宙噪声的波形太熟悉了，眼前移动的波形，似乎多了某种说不出来的东西，这条起伏的细线像是有了灵魂。他敢肯定，眼前的电波是被智能调剂的！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He rushed in front of another terminal and checked the computer's rating of the signal's recognizability: a Red 10. Before this, no radio signal received by the listening post had ever garnered a recognizability rating above a Blue 2. A Red rating meant the likelihood that the transmission contained intelligent information was greater than 90 percent. A rating of Red 10 meant the received transmission contained a self-interpreting coding system! The deciphering computer worked at full power. Still caught up by the dizzying excitement and confusion, the listener stared at the waveform display. Information continued to stream from the universe into the antenna. Because of the self-interpreting code, the computer was able to perform real-time translation, and the message began to show up immediately.</div>

During the long loneliness of the past, the listener had asked himself more than once: Even if one day a message from an extra-Trisolaran civilization were to arrive, what would that have to do with me? His own lonely and humble life would not change one iota because of it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="激动和兴奋很快冷却下来，剩下的只有失落和凄凉。在过去那漫长的孤寂时光中，监听员不止一次地问过自己：即使有一天真的收到了外星文明的情息，与自己又有什么关系呢？那个天堂不用于自己，自己这孤独而卑微的生活不会因此有丝毫改变。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But now the listener saw another possibility. It was inaccurate to say that the receipt of the extra-Trisolaran message had no influence on his life. After confirmation, Trisolaris would surely reduce the number of listening posts. And posts like this one, behind the times, would be among the first to be cut. Then he would be unemployed. A listener's skills were very specialized, consisting only of some routine operations and maintenance. It would be very difficult to find another job. If he couldn't find another job within five thousand Trisolaran hours, he would be forcibly dehydrated and then burnt.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在，监听员突然又想到了另一种可能：说收到外星信息对自己没有影响是不确切的，在目标确定后，三体世界必然会裁减一部分监听站，而自己所在的这种落后的站点肯定是在首批裁减之列，那时他将面临失业。监听员的技能很单—，只是一些程式化的操作和维护，很难找到别的工作。如果在五千个三体时之内还找不到工作，他也将面临着强制脱水后被焚烧掉的命运。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The listener woke up from his nightmare and saw the giant moon, just risen, casting a thin ray of cold light through the small window. He looked at the frozen ground outside the window and reviewed his lonely life. By now, he had lived six hundred thousand Trisolaran hours. The life expectancy of Trisolarans ranged between seven hundred to eight hundred thousand Trisolaran hours. Most people, of course, would have lost the ability to work productively long before then. They would have been forcibly dehydrated, and the resulting dry fibers cast to the flames. Trisolaris did not keep the idle around.</div>

<div class="line_en">The only way to escape this fate was to mate with a member of the opposite sex. When that happened, the organic material making up their bodies would meld into one.

Then this body would divide into three to five tiny new lives: their children. They would inherit some of the memories of their parents, continue their lives, and begin the cycle of life anew.

<div class="line_cn" title="距离，关键是距离！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The listener knew that at the scale of the universe, due to the lack of a sufficiently long measurement baseline, it was impossible to determine the distance of a source of low-frequency radio transmission from space, only the direction. The source could be high-powered but far away, or low-powered but close by. In that direction were billions of stars, each shining against a sea of other stars at different distances. Without knowing how far away the source was, it was impossible to ascertain its exact coordinates.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="监听员知道，在宇宙尺度上，对于来自太空的低频电波，因为没有足够长的测量范围，只能确定发射源的方向，却无法知道其距离；在那个方向上，可能是远距离的高功率发射源，也可能是近距离的低功率发射源；那个方向有亿万颗恒星，每一颗都以远近不同的星星汇成的星海为背景，不知道发射源的距离，根本不可能确定位置坐标。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Indeed, there was an easy way to ascertain the distance of the transmission source. Just respond to the message, and if the other party replies quickly to the response, the Trisolarans could determine the distance based on the round-trip time and the speed of light. Or maybe they would take a really long time to reply and cause the Trisolarans to be unable to determine how long the message was en route.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="其实，确定发源距离的方法十分简单：给对方回复一个信息，如果对方在收到这个回信后短时间内回答，由间隔时间和光速就可以得知距离。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But the question was: Would the other party reply? Since this source had actively sent out a call into the universe, it was very likely that they would reply after getting a response from Trisolaris. And the listener was sure that the Trisolaran government had already given the order to send a message to that distant world to lure them to respond. Maybe the message had already been sent, but maybe not. If the latter was true, then the listener had a singular chance to make his own humble life glow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="问题是：对方会回答吗？或者在延迟很长时间以后回答，使三体人无法确定电波信号在路上消耗的时间有多少。但既然这个发射源主动向宇宙中发出呼唤，那他们接到三体世界的信息后有很大可能会回答的。监听员可以肯定，现在三体政府已经发出了指令，向那个遥远的世界发出信息，引诱他们回答。信息也许已经发出，也许还没有。如果是后者，那么他就有了使自己这卑微的生命燃烧一次的机会。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"There's nothing wrong, of course. Existence is the premise for everything else. But, Princeps, please examine our lives: Everything is devoted to survival. To permit the survival of the civilization as a whole, there is almost no respect for the individual. Someone who can no longer work is put to death. Trisolaran society exists under a state of extreme authoritarianism. The law has only two outcomes: The guilty are put to death, and the not guilty are released. For me, the most intolerable aspects are the spiritual monotony and desiccation. Anything that can lead to spiritual weakness is declared evil. We have no literature, no art, no pursuit of beauty and enjoyment. We cannot even speak of love… Princeps, is there meaning to such a life?"</div>

If I can save a distant, beautiful world that I have fallen in love with, then my life has not been wasted. Of course, Princeps, this also gave me a chance to see you.
