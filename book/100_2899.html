<div class="line_en">Sylvie Cope. Her name is Sylvie Cope, a beautiful name, and if you asked him what she is like he would shake his head and blow air through his mouth and say that she is great, just great, just… amazing! She is beautiful of course, but in a different way from the others -- not lads-mag-bubbly like Suki Meadows, or trendy-beautiful like Naomi or Ingrid or Yolande, but serenely, classically beautiful; in an earlier TV presenter incarnation, he might have called her "classy", or even "dead classy". Long, straight fair hair, parted severely in the middle, small neat features set perfectly in a pale heart-shaped face, she reminds him of a woman in a painting that he can't remember the name of, someone mediaeval with flowers in her hair. That is what Sylvie Cope is like; the kind of woman who would look perfectly at home with her arms draped around a unicorn. Tall and slim, a little austere, frequently quite stern, with a face that doesn't move much except to frown or sometimes to roll her eyes at some stupid thing he's said or done; Sylvie is perfect, and demands perfection.</div>

<div class="line_en">Her ears stick out just a tiny, tiny bit so that they glow like coral with the light behind her, and in the same light you can see a fine downy hair on her cheeks and forehead. At other, more superficial times in his life Dexter might have found these qualities, the glowing ears, the hairy forehead, off-putting but as he looks at her now, seated at the table opposite him on an English lawn in high summer, her perfect little chin resting on her long-fingered hand, swallows overhead, candles lighting her face just like in those paintings by the candle-guy, he finds her completely hypnotic. She smiles at him across the table and he decides that tonight is the night that he will tell her that he loves her. He has never really said "I love you" before, not sober and on purpose. He has said "I fucking love you", but that's different, and he feels that now is the time to use the words in their purest form. He is so taken with this plan that he is momentarily unable to concentrate on what is being said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她的双耳略微招风，于是像珊瑚般透射着光芒，映得颊上额前的毛发茸茸可人。在德克斯特更浅薄的时候，他或许会认为这些外观特征都是惹人不悦的。然而此刻，在英格兰炎炎夏夜里的一块草坪上：望着她对坐在桌前，在烛光的映照下，将修长的手指支着完美的下巴，加上头顶为伴的燕子，他便觉她宛如画中人。德克斯特神魂颠倒了。望着她隔着桌子冲他微笑，他决意就在今晚对她说，“我爱你”。他从未真正对她说过，“我真他妈的爱你”当然不能算数，他感觉此刻来一次正经的表白恰是时候。他投人地想着这个计划，竟走了神。">查看中文翻译</div>

Dexter's just a charm-boy, a has-been, a poser on the way down. There is silence at the table. Was he meant to keep talking?

<div class="line_en">Dexter smiles too, but the fact is life has become a great deal quieter recently. Mayhem TV plc has yet to earn a commission, or a meeting with a commissioner, and at the moment still exists only in the form of expensively headed paper. Aaron, his agent, has dropped him.

He is no longer the voice of premium cider, has been quietly expelled from poker school, and even the guy who plays the congas in Jamiroquai doesn't call him anymore.

In truth, they're not really his sort, these hyper-confident über-boyfriends. They remind him of the prefects and head-boys he knew at school; not unpleasant, just not very cool. Never mind.

<div class="line_en">But the single most striking thing about Sylvie is that he likes her so much more than she likes him. He likes her straightforwardness, her self-confidence and poise. He likes her ambition, which is ferocious and unapologetic, and her taste, which is expensive and immaculate. Of course he likes the way she looks, and the way they look together, but he also likes her lack of sentimentality; she is as hard, bright and desirable as a diamond and for the first time in his life, he has had to do the chasing. On their first date, a ruinously expensive French restaurant in Chelsea, he had wondered aloud if she was enjoying herself. She was having a wonderful time, she said, but she didn't like to laugh in company because she didn't like what laughter did to her face. And although a part of him felt a little chill at this, a part of him also had to admire her commitment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而西尔维最让他震惊之处是，他喜欢她远远多于她喜欢他。他喜欢她的直截了当、自信从容，喜欢她赤裸裸的勃勃雄心，喜欢她昂贵而完美的品位，当然还喜欢她的相貌，以及他们相处时的感觉。她缺乏多愁善感的气质，不过这也符合他的口味。她如钻石般强硬、闪耀、撩动人的占有欲，所以平生第一次，他不得不去主动追求。第一次约会是在一家切尔西的法国餐厅，消费高得简直是在敲骨吸髓。他实在没把握是否让她开心了，便开了询问。她度过了愉快的时光，她回答，不过她不喜欢在人前笑，因为不喜欢自已笑的样子。尽管他心里生出儿分寒意，但同时义欣赏她的坦诚。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Serenity and drunkenness don't really go together and save for the occasional glass of champagne or wine with dinner, Sylvie doesn't drink alcohol. Neither does she smoke or take drugs or eat red meat or bread or refined sugar or potatoes. More significantly, she has no time for Dexter drunk. His abilities as a fabled mixologist mean nothing to her. She finds inebriation embarrassing and unmanly, and more than once he has found himself alone at the end of the evening because of that third martini. Though it has never been stated as such, he has been given a choice: clean up your act, sort out your life, or you will lose me. Consequently there are fewer hangovers these days, fewer nose-bleeds, fewer mornings spent writhing in shame and self-disgust. He no longer goes to bed with a bottle of red wine in case he gets thirsty in the night, and for this he is grateful. He feels like a new man.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="儒雅和醉酒无法并存，唯有偶尔在晚餐时来一杯香槟或葡萄酒，因为西尔维不喜欢酒精。她不吸烟不沾毒，不吃红肉、面包、精制糖，连土豆也不碰。最要命的是，她绝容不得他再做醉汉。他吹嘘的调酒手艺对她来说毫无意义。她认为醉态是一种尴尬，毫无男子气概可言，也不止一次在深夜里将他撇下，就因为他多喝了一杯马提尼。尽管从来没有明说过，但他清楚这样的选择：摒弃做作，检点行为，整饬生活，否则就会失去她。结果是，他的宿醉头晕减少了，流鼻血减少了，醒来后的自怜自弃也减少了。他再也不会带着一瓶红酒上床睡觉，半夜口渴时喝，对此他心怀感激。他觉得自己在重新做人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This visit, his first to the parental home, is part of a long weekend, a stopover in Chichester before they continue down the M3 to a rented cottage in Cornwall, where Sylvie is going to teach him how to surf. Of course he shouldn't really be taking all this time off, he should be working, or looking for work. But the prospect of Sylvie, stern and rosy-cheeked in a wetsuit with her hair tied back, is almost more than he can bear.

Sex with Sylvie is like a particularly demanding game of squash, leaving him aching and with a general sense that he has lost. Physical contact is rare and when it does come, tends to spring from nowhere, violently and swiftly. Now, suddenly, she puts her hand to the back of his head and kisses him hard, at the same time taking his other hand and jamming it between her legs. He looks into her eyes, wide and intent, and sets his own face to express desire, rather than discomfort at the dishwasher door chafing his shins. He can hear the family marching into the house, the twins' boorish voices in the hallway. He tries to pull away, but his lower lip is gripped neatly between Sylvie's teeth, stretching out comically like a Warner Brothers cartoon. He whimpers and she laughs then lets go of his lip so that it snaps back like a rollerblind.</div>

Her eyes are blinking wide and her hand is cupped to her face, but it's already possible to see the dark rivulet of blood as it trickles down beneath her nose. She is moaning quietly to herself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="德克斯特扯下眼罩，却见西尔维不知怎的已经被送到了房间的一端，颓坐在壁炉边，像一只断了线的牵线玩偶。她眨巴着圆瞪的双眼，脸用手捂着，不过上面顺着鼻孔淌下来的血线清楚可见，她顾自轻声吟着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Behind him, Sam ties his blindfold tight as a tourniquet. "We'll see, won't we?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Momentarily an image flickers in his mind -- a baseball player on his mound -- as he slices diagonally with the bat, a tremendous uppercut that swishes audibly through the air and from behind the blindfold the impact feels fantastic as it sends tremors along both arms and into his chest. A moment of awed silence follows and for a moment Dexter is sure that he has done very, very well. And then he hears a crash, and an appalled cry goes up in unison from the whole family.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一个念头瞬间在他脑中闪过：他是站在土墩上的棒球手，纸棒脱手，带着风声劈了出去，自下而上画了一个大斜角。他隔着眼罩就感觉到了击中的美妙效果，因为他的双臂乃至胸部都颤动起来。紧跟着的是一阵让人发慌的安静，那一刻，德克斯特确信自己干得非常漂亮。然后是碰撞声，以及那一家子人令人心悸的惊叫。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I can't. I'll start bleeding. I'll make up for it tomorrow." She turns away again. Satisfied now, he sinks lower and puts his hands behind his head. The bed is immense and soft and smells of freshly washed linen, and the windows open out onto a still summer night. Stripped of quilts and blankets, they lie beneath a single white cotton sheet, and he can see the wonderful line of her legs and narrow hips, the curve of her long smooth back. Tonight's sexual potential evaporated with the moment of impact and the possibility of concussion, but still he turns to her and places one hand beneath the sheet and onto her thigh. The skin is cool and smooth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不行啊，我会流血的。明天补给你吧。”她又转过身去。他终于满意了，向下挪了挪身子，将双手枕在脑后。床又大又软，散发出刚洗过的亚麻布的气味，窗户敞开着，与宁静的夏夜气息相通。被子和毯子已经撤去，只剩一条白色的棉布床单。他能隐约看见她的曼妙曲线，从双腿到紧致的臀部，直至光滑修长的脊背。那一下打，说不定已经导致了脑震荡，今夜的性爱自然也成了泡影，不过他还是凑近她，一只手在床单里摸到她的大腿。皮肤的触感又滑又凉。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He continues to look at the back of her head, where the long fine hair falls away from the nape of her neck, revealing the darker whorls beneath. You could take a photograph of that, he thinks, it is so beautiful. Call it "Texture". He wonders if he still might tell her that he loves her or, more tentatively, that he "thinks he might be in love with her", which is both more touching and easier to back out of.
