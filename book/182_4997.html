<div class="line_en">"Oh, I say nothing at all," answered the Dwarf. "If you all go, of course, I'll go with you; and if your party splits up, I'll go with the High King. That's my duty to him and King Caspian. But, if you ask my private opinion, I'm a plain dwarf who doesn't think there's much chance of finding a road by night where you couldn't find one by day. And I have no use for magic lions which are talking lions and don't talk, and friendly lions though they don't do us any good, and whopping big lions though nobody can see them. It's all bilge and beanstalks as far as I can see."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“那么走吧。”彼得一边说一边懒懒地穿上盔甲。如果换个其他场合，他都会对露茜说些鼓励或安慰的话，因为她毕竟是他最喜爱的小妹妹。他心里清楚，此时露茜一定十分难过，而且不论刚才发生了什么，都不是她的过错。然而，他也不由自主地对她有点儿恼火。">查看中文翻译</div>

The others had only Lucy's directions to guide them, for Aslan was not only invisible to them but silent as well. His big cat-like paws made no noise on the grass.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一行人终于出发了。露茜走在最前面，她咬紧嘴唇，把一肚子想对苏珊说的话咽了下去。说也奇怪，她抬眼看到阿斯兰，便一下子把那些抱怨的话忘到九霄云外去了，阿斯兰在他们前面大约二十米开外，不慌不忙地领路。其他人只有跟着露茜。他们不仅看不到阿斯兰，也听不到它的声音。它那猫爪一样的巨爪落在草地上，悄然无声。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He led them to the right of the dancing trees -- whether they were still dancing nobody knew, for Lucy had her eyes on the Lion and the rest had their eyes on Lucy -- and nearer the edge of the gorge. "Cobbles and kettledrums!" thought Trumpkin. "I hope this madness isn't going to end in a moonlight climb and broken necks."</div>

<div class="line_en">For a long way Aslan went along the top of the precipices. Then they came to a place where some little trees grew right on the edge. He turned and disappeared among them. Lucy held her breath, for it looked as if he had plunged over the cliff; but she was too busy keeping him in sight to stop and think about this. She quickened her pace and was soon among the trees herself. Looking down, she could see a steep and narrow path going slantwise down into the gorge between rocks, and Aslan descending it. He turned and looked at her with his happy eyes. Lucy clapped her hands and began to scramble down after him. From behind her she heard the voices of the others shouting, "Hi! Lucy! Look out, for goodness' sake. You're right on the edge of the gorge. Come back -- "and then, a moment later, Edmund's voice saying, "No, she's right. There is a way down."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿斯兰领他们沿着悬崖峭壁走了很长一段路，然后来到一个地方。崖边长着一些小树。它转个弯，消失在小树丛中。露茜一下屏住了呼吸。怎么，要从这悬崖跳下去？可是她必须跟紧阿斯兰，不能失去它的踪迹。来不及停下来细想，她加快脚步，一下子也消失在小树丛中。朝下望去，她看到一条陡直的羊肠小道，通向那夹在黑压压巨大岩石之间的峡谷底部，阿斯兰正沿着小路往下走。它忽然转过身来，用满意和鼓励的目光看着她。露茜拍拍手，随它而下。这时身后传来其他人的喊声：“喂，露茜，当心！上帝呀！你就在悬崖的边缘！快回来——”可是紧接着又传来爱德蒙的声音：“不，她没错，这儿是有一条往下去的小路。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“快走畦，爱德蒙国王，快走。”身后传来杜鲁普金的催促声。接着，再往后，在靠近崖顶的地方，传来彼得的声音：“苏珊，勇敢些，把手伸给我。瞧你，小娃娃也能走到这里来，别吓成那个样子。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In a few minutes they were at the bottom and the roaring of water filled their ears. Treading delicately, like a cat, Aslan stepped from stone to stone across the stream. In the middle he stopped, bent down to drink, and as he raised his shaggy head, dripping from the water, he turned to face them again. This time Edmund saw him. "Oh, Aslan!" he cried, darting forward. But the Lion whisked round and began padding up the slope on the far side of the Rush.</div>

<div class="line_en">Aslan without hesitation led them to their left, farther up the gorge. The whole journey was odd and dream-like the roaring stream, the wet grey grass, the glimmering cliffs which they were approaching, and always the glorious, silently pacing Beast ahead. Everyone except Susan and the Dwarf could see him now.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿斯兰毫不迟疑地领他们向左边上游的方向走去。一路上大家都有种奇怪的感觉，仿佛在做梦——那奔流的河水、湿润的草地、隐约的峭壁，还有走在前面那威严却一直默默无语的雄狮。此刻，除了苏珊和小矮人，别人都可以清楚地看到阿斯兰了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I saw something," said Peter. "But it's so tricky in this moonlight. On we go, though, and three cheers for Lucy. I don't feel half so tired now, either."</div>

<div class="line_en">Lucy was nearly blown when the tail and hind legs of Aslan disappeared over the top: but with one last effort she scrambled after him and came out, rather shaky-legged and breathless, on the hill they had been trying to reach ever since they left Glasswater. The long gentle slope (heather and grass and a few very big rocks that shone white in the moonlight) stretched up to where it vanished in a glimmer of trees about half a mile away. She knew it. It was the hill of the Stone Table:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当阿斯兰的身影在崖顶上消失之后，露茜差点儿泄了气。她鼓足最后的勇气，奋力登上崖项。这时她已是两腿发颤，上气不接下气了。自从离开清水湾以来，他们历尽了千辛万苦。这时她狂喜地看到，目的地就在眼前。一段不陡的坡地从容地向前延伸，直到数百米以外的一个小山丘，山丘上覆盖着绿色的树。露茜知道，那就是石桌所在地。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Presently they came to another steep path, up the face of the farther precipices. These were far higher than the ones they had just descended, and the journey up them was a long and tedious zig-zag.

<div class="line_cn" title="不久，他们来到另一条陡峭的小路前。这条小路一直通向崖项。与刚刚走下来的河对岸的山崖相比，这边高多了，也险多了。值得庆幸的是，这时月亮恰好悬挂在峡谷的上方，把两岸山崖都照得雪亮。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Wraiths and wreckage!" gasped Trumpkin in the ghost of a voice. The children, who knew Aslan well enough to see that he liked the Dwarf very much, were not disturbed; but it was quite another thing for Trumpkin, who had never seen a lion before, let alone this Lion. He did the only sensible thing he could have done; that is, instead of bolting, he tottered towards Aslan.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“上帝保佑，上帝保佑，唷嗬嗬……”由于极度的敬畏和紧张，那小矮人叽里咕噜，嘴里不停地念叨着什么。孩子们都很熟悉阿斯兰，看得出它十分喜欢杜鲁普金，所以都让到一边，饶有兴趣地看着。杜鲁普金此刻的心情却大不一样。他从未见过狮子，更不曾单独与一头狮子呆在一起。好在他没有慌忙逃走，而是战战兢兢地向狮子挪过去，这倒是明智的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"And now!" said Aslan in a much louder voice with just a hint of roar in it, while his tail lashed his flanks. "And now, where is this little Dwarf, this famous swordsman and archer, who doesn't believe in lions? Come here, son of Earth, come HERE!" -- and the last word was no longer the hint of a roar but almost the real thing.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="小矮人仍然一言不发，两个男孩谁也不敢开口问阿斯兰是否随后就来。三个人抽出宝剑，一齐向阿斯兰行个礼，然后转过身去，很快便消失在夜色中。露茜注意到他们脸上毫无倦意，只有男子汉一往直前的坚毅和果敢。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Dwarf, hunched up in a little, miserable ball, hung from Aslan's mouth.

As he came down the huge velvety paws caught him as gently as a mother's arms and set him (right way up, too) on the ground.</div>

<div class="line_en">The sound, deep and throbbing at first like an organ beginning on a low note, rose and became louder, and then far louder again, till the earth and air were shaking with it. It rose up from that hill and floated across all Narnia. Down in Miraz's camp men woke, stared palely in one another's faces, and grasped their weapons. Down below that in the Great River, now at its coldest hour, the heads and shoulders of the nymphs, and the great weedy-bearded head of the river-god, rose from the water. Beyond it, in every field and wood, the alert ears of rabbits rose from their holes, the sleepy heads of birds came out from under wings, owls hooted, vixens barked, hedgehogs grunted, the trees stirred. In towns and villages mothers pressed babies close to their breasts, staring with wild eyes, dogs whimpered, and men leaped up groping for lights. Far away on the northern frontier the mountain giants peered from the dark gateways of their castles.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那声音深沉、有力，仿佛风琴从低音奏起，音调越来越高，音量越来越大，直到大地和空气都随之震颤。那吼声从他们脚下的小山上发出，很快向四面八方传去，震撼了整个纳尼亚。弥若兹的军队被惊醒了，士兵们一个个面无血色，茫然不知所措，老半天才想起去抓自己的武器；大河的下游，在这清晨最寒冷的时刻，树神扬起了头，水神也从河里探起身来。更远的地方，在每一块田野上，每一片树林里，窝里的兔子竖起了耳朵，熟睡的小鸟儿也把脑袋从翅膀下面伸了出来；各种动物的叫声汇成一支奇妙的交响乐。在城镇，在乡村，母亲们把孩子更紧地抱在怀里，睁大了眼睛聆听着。男人们则跳下床来，伸手去抓猎枪。连院子里的狗也忍不住汪汪叫个不停。在北部边陲的山上，巨人们揉着惺忪的睡眼，走出黑黑的山洞，想看看究竟发生了什么事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The girls watched them out of sight, standing close beside Aslan. The light was changing. Low down in the east, Aravir, the morning star of Narnia, gleamed like a little moon. Aslan, who seemed larger than before, lifted his head, shook his mane, and roared.</div>

<div class="line_en">The crowd and the dance round Aslan (for it had become a dance once more) grew so thick and rapid that Lucy was confused. She never saw where certain other people came from who were soon capering about among the trees. One was a youth, dressed only in a fawn-skin, with vine-leaves wreathed in his curly hair. His face would have been almost too pretty for a boy's, if it had not looked, so extremely wild. You felt, as Edmund said when he saw him a few days later, "There's a chap who might do anything absolutely anything." He seemed to have a great many names -- Bromios, Bassareus, and the Ram were three of them. There were a lot of girls with him, as wild as he. There was even, unexpectedly, someone on a donkey. And everybody was laughing: and everybody was shouting out, "Euan, euan, eu-oi-oi-oi."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="聚集在阿斯兰身边的人越来越多，欢乐的舞蹈也更加热烈，这使露茜感到有点儿不可理解。她从未经历过如此激动人心的场面。一个年轻人，身穿树皮，鬈发之上戴着一只树叶编织的草环，要不是脸上充满了野性，就会漂亮得简直不像个男孩了。你从这张脸上可以看出，正如爱德蒙几天后见到他时说的那样：“这个人什么事都干得出来。”他身边有许多女孩子，和他一样充满了野性的活力。每个人都在欢呼，在雀跃。最出人意料也最引人注目的是位极其肥胖的矮个子老人。他骑着一头毛驴。那毛驴确信这是大显身手的最好时机，决定给大家表演后腿行走。结果胖老人一次又一次给摔下来，马上又被身边快乐的人们扶上去。老人高兴地在驴背上扭摆着，嘴里不停地喊：“来点儿喝的！来点儿点心！”不知谁送来许多好吃的东西，大家也顾不得礼仪，下手就抓。一边吃，一边跳，一边嬉笑，一边高声喊叫着：“呜依——呜，呜依……依……依呜！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">What Lucy and Susan saw was a dark something coming to them from almost every direction across the hills. It looked first like a black mist creeping on the ground, then like the stormy waves of a black sea rising higher and higher as it came on, and then, at last, like what it was woods on the move. All the trees of the world appeared to be rushing towards Aslan. But as they drew nearer they looked less like trees; and when the whole crowd, bowing and curtsying and waving thin long arms to Aslan, were all around Lucy, she saw that it was a crowd of human shapes. Pale birch-girls were tossing their heads, willowwomen pushed back their hair from their brooding faces to gaze on Aslan, the queenly beeches stood still and adored him, shaggy oak-men, lean and melancholy elms, shockheaded hollies (dark themselves, but their wives all bright with berries) and gay rowans, all bowed and rose again, shouting, "Aslan, Aslan!" in their various husky or creaking or wave-like voices.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Is it a Romp, Aslan?" cried the youth. And apparently it was. But nearly everyone seemed to have a different idea as to what they were playing. It may have been Tig, but Lucy never discovered who was It. It was rather like Blind Man's Buff, only everyone behaved as if they were blindfolded. It was not unlike Hunt the Slipper, but the slipper was never found. What made it more complicated was that the man on the donkey, who was old and enormously fat, began calling out at once, "Refreshments! Time for refreshments," and falling off his donkey and being bundled on to it again by the others, while the donkey was under the impression that the whole thing was a circus and tried to give a display of walking on its hind legs. And all the time there were more and more vine leaves everywhere. And soon not only leaves but vines. They were climbing up everything. They were running up the legs of the tree people and circling round their necks. Lucy put up her hands to push back her hair and found she was pushing back vine branches. The donkey was a mass of them. His tail was completely entangled and something dark was nodding between his ears. Lucy looked again and saw it was a bunch of grapes. After that it was mostly grapes overhead and underfoot and all around.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这是一场闹剧吗，阿斯兰？”年轻人哭了。显然是的。但几乎每个人对他们在玩什么都有不同的想法。可能是Tig，但露西从未发现它是谁。这很像盲人的小丑，只是每个人都表现得好像被蒙住了眼睛。这和猎取拖鞋没什么不同，但这只拖鞋从未被发现。更为复杂的是，驴子上的那个老大胖的人立刻叫道：“点心！是吃点心的时候了，”他从驴子身上摔下来，又被其他人捆在驴子身上，而驴子却觉得这一切都是马戏团的表演，想展示一下用后腿走路的样子。一直以来，到处都有越来越多的藤叶。很快，不仅是树叶，还有藤蔓。他们爬上了所有的东西。他们跑上树人的腿，绕着他们的脖子转来转去。露西举起手把头发往后推，发现她正在把藤蔓树枝往后推。驴子是他们中的一大群。他的尾巴完全被缠住了，一个黑乎乎的东西在他的耳朵间打盹。露西又看了一眼，发现是一串葡萄。在那之后，主要是葡萄在头上，脚下和周围。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Everyone began eating, and whatever hothouses your people may have, you have never tasted such grapes. Really good grapes, firm and tight on the outside, but bursting into cool sweetness when you put them into your mouth, were one of the things the girls had never had quite enough of before. Here, there were more than anyone could possibly want, and rib table-manners at all. One saw sticky and stained fingers everywhere, and, though mouths were full, the laughter never ceased nor the yodelling cries of Euan, euan, eu-oi-oi-oi-oi, till all of a sudden everyone felt at the same moment that the game (whatever it was), and the feast, ought to be over, and everyone flopped down breathless on the ground and turned their faces to Aslan to hear what he would say next.</div>
