<div class="line_en">My mom, meanwhile, was plenty happy to serve us. It gave her an easy window into our world. As my friends and I ate and gossiped, she often stood by quietly, engaged in some household chore, not hiding the fact that she was taking in every word. In my family, with four of us packed into less than nine hundred square feet of living space, we'd never had any privacy anyway. It mattered only sometimes. Craig, who was suddenly interested in girls, had started taking his phone calls behind closed doors in the bathroom, the phone's curlicue cord stretched taut across the hallway from its wall-mounted base in the kitchen.</div>

<div class="line_en">At school, we were given an hour-long break for lunch each day. Because my mother didn't work and our apartment was so close by, I usually marched home with four or five other girls in tow, all of us talking nonstop, ready to sprawl on the kitchen floor to play jacks and watch All My Children while my mom handed out sandwiches. This, for me, began a habit that has sustained me for life, keeping a close and high-spirited council of girlfriends -- a safe harbor of female wisdom. In my lunch group, we dissected whatever had gone on that morning at school, any beefs we had with teachers, any assignments that struck us as useless. Our opinions were largely formed by committee. We idolized the Jackson 5 and weren't sure how we felt about the Osmonds. Watergate had happened, but none of us understood it. It seemed like a lot of old guys talking into microphones in Washington, D. C., which to us was just a faraway city filled with a lot of white buildings and white men.</div>

<div class="line_en">As Chicago schools went, Bryn Mawr fell somewhere between a bad school and a good school. Racial and economic sorting in the South Shore neighborhood continued through the 1970s, meaning that the student population only grew blacker and poorer with each year. There was, for a time, a citywide integration movement to bus kids to new schools, but Bryn Mawr parents had successfully fought it off, arguing that the money was better spent improving the school itself. As a kid, I had no perspective on whether the facilities were run-down or whether it mattered that there were hardly any white kids left. The school ran from kindergarten all the way through eighth grade, which meant that by the time I'd reached the upper grades, I knew every light switch, every chalkboard and cracked patch of hallway. I knew nearly every teacher and most of the kids. For me, Bryn Mawr was practically an extension of home.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在芝加哥的学校中，布林茅尔小学排名中等，不好也不坏。南岸社区的种族和经济分层一直贯穿了整个20世纪70年代，这意味着黑人学生和贫困学生的比例在逐年增加。当时，芝加哥掀起了一场席卷全市的种族融合运动，要把孩子用校车都送到新的学校去，但是布林茅尔的学生家长成功地抵制了这场运动，他们认为把钱花在提升学校质量上才更明智。当时我还是个小孩，不清楚学校的设施是否破旧，以及学校里白人小孩少有什么关系。学校从幼儿园一直开到八年级，这也意味着我上到高年级时，对学校里每一个电灯开关、每一块黑板，走廊上的每一道裂缝都将了如指掌。我认识这里几乎所有的老师和学生。对我来说，布林茅尔几乎就是家的延伸。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As I was entering seventh grade, the Chicago Defender, a weekly newspaper that was popular with African American readers, ran a vitriolic opinion piece that claimed Bryn Mawr had gone, in the span of a few years, from being one of the city's best public schools to a "run-down slum" governed by a "ghetto mentality." Our school principal, Dr. Lavizzo, immediately hit back with a letter to the editor, defending his community of parents and students and deeming the newspaper piece "an outrageous lie, which seems designed to incite only feelings of failure and flight."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我快上七年级时，《芝加哥守卫者》周报上刊登了一篇措辞尖锐的评论文章。文章指出，布林茅尔小学在几年时间里，已经从全市最好的公立学校之一沦落为“贫民区思维”管理下的一个“破旧的贫民窟”。这份报纸的主要读者是非洲裔美国人。我们的校长拉韦佐博士很快写信给那位报纸编辑进行回击，他为社区的家长和学生辩护，并指出这篇文章是“可怖的谎言，旨在煽动失败和逃离的情绪”。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dr. Lavizzo was a round, cheery man who had an Afro that puffed out on either side of his bald spot and who spent most of his time in an office near the building's front door. It's clear from his letter that he understood precisely what he was up against. Failure is a feeling long before it becomes an actual result. It's vulnerability that breeds with self-doubt and then is escalated, often deliberately, by fear. Those "feelings of failure" he mentioned were everywhere already in my neighborhood, in the form of parents who couldn't get ahead financially, of kids who were starting to suspect that their lives would be no different, of families who watched their better-off neighbors leave for the suburbs or transfer their children to Catholic schools. There were predatory real estate agents roaming South Shore all the while, whispering to home owners that they should sell before it was too late, that they'd help them get out while you still can. The inference being that failure was coming, that it was inevitable, that it had already half arrived. You could get caught up in the ruin or you could escape it. They used the word everyone was most afraid of --"ghetto"-- dropping it like a lit match.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="拉韦佐博士是一个笑眯眯的胖子，秃顶的脑袋两边各留着一簇浓密的小短卷。他大多数时候都待在学校前门附近的办公室里。从他的信中可以看出，他很清楚自己面对的敌人是谁。失败先是一种感觉，很久后才会变成实际的结果。它先是由自我怀疑滋生出无力感，而后升级，这一切通常是由刻意营造的恐慌所导致的。他提到的这种“失败情绪”已经在我住的社区里蔓延，附着在那些经济状况始终得不到改善的家长身上，那些开始怀疑自己的未来不会有任何改变的孩子，以及那些眼见家境富裕的邻居搬到郊区或者把孩子转到天主教会学校的家庭身上。这里随处可见掠食成性的房产经纪人，他们向业主们吹耳边风：赶快把房子卖掉，趁一切还来得及，赶快离开，他们会提供帮助。言下之意是，失败即将来临，这是不可避免的，而且你已经能感觉到它了。你可以选择变得一贫如洗，或者选择逃离。他们用了人们最惧怕的那个词—“贫民区”，把它像点燃的火柴一样扔在地上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">My mother bought into none of this. She'd lived in South Shore for ten years already and would end up staying another forty. She didn't buy into fearmongering and at the same time seemed equally inoculated against any sort of pie-in-the-sky idealism. She was a straight-down-the-line realist, controlling what she could.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这些话我母亲统统不信。她已经在南岸社区住了十年，后来又接着在这里住了四十年。她不相信这些恐怖的流言，而且对任何描绘美好愿景的理想主义也同样免疫。她是个彻头彻尾的现实主义者，只相信自己的掌控力。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At Bryn Mawr, she became one of the most active members of the PTA, helping raise funds for new classroom equipment, throwing appreciation dinners for the teachers, and lobbying for the creation of a special multigrade classroom that catered to higher-performing students. This last effort was the brainchild of Dr. Lavizzo, who'd gone to night school to get his PhD in education and had studied a new trend in grouping students by ability rather than by age -- in essence, putting the brighter kids together so they could learn at a faster pace.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在布林茅尔小学，她成为家长教师联谊会最活跃的成员之一，为购买新教学设备筹款，为老师举办答谢宴，为成立适合优等生需求的特殊混合班级拉票。最后这个设想是拉韦佐博士提议的。他在夜校拿到了教育学博士学位，一直致力于新教育趋势研究—将学生按照能力而非年龄进行分组教学。其实就是把更聪明的孩子放在一起，让他们以更快的节奏学习。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The idea was controversial, criticized as being undemocratic, as all "gifted and talented" programs inherently are. But it was also gaining steam as a movement around the country, and for my last three years at Bryn Mawr I was a beneficiary. I joined a group of about twenty students from different grades, set off in a self-contained classroom apart from the rest of the school with our own recess, lunch, music, and gym schedules. We were given special opportunities, including weekly trips to a community college to attend an advanced writing workshop or dissect a rat in the biology lab. Back in the classroom, we did a lot of independent work, setting our own goals and moving at whatever speed best suited us.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个提议是有争议的，被批评为不平等，而不平等是所有“优等生”计划的固有问题。但在当时，这项运动已经在全美国蔚然成风，我在布林茅尔小学的最后三年，成了这项计划的受益者。我和来自不同年级的大约二十个孩子被安排在一间独立的教室。跟学校其他班级不同，我们有单独的休息、午餐、音乐和体育时间表。我们还能得到一些特殊机会，比如每周去社区大学参加高级写作研习班，或者在生物实验室解剖老鼠。回到教室后，我们有很多自主学习时间，自己给自己设定目标，按照最适合自己的速度学习。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We were given dedicated teachers, first Mr. Martinez and then Mr. Bennett, both gentle and good-humored African American men, both keenly focused on what their students had to say. There was a clear sense that the school had invested in us, which I think made us all try harder and feel better about ourselves. The independent learning setup only served to fuel my competitive streak. I tore through the lessons, quietly keeping tabs on where I stood among my peers as we charted our progress from long division to pre-algebra, from writing single paragraphs to turning in full research papers. For me, it was like a game. And as with any game, like most any kid, I was happiest when I was ahead.</div>

<div class="line_en">I told my mother everything that happened at school. Her lunchtime update was followed by a second update, which I'd deliver in a rush as I walked through the door in the afternoon, slinging my book bag on the floor and hunting for a snack. I realize I don't know exactly what my mom did during the hours we were at school, mainly because in the self-centered manner of any child I never asked. I don't know what she thought about, how she felt about being a traditional homemaker as opposed to working a different job. I only knew that when I showed up at home, there'd be food in the fridge, not just for me, but for my friends. I knew that when my class was going on an excursion, my mother would almost always volunteer to chaperone, arriving in a nice dress and dark lipstick to ride the bus with us to the community college or the zoo.</div>

<div class="line_en">Every so often, she'd change the layout of our living room, putting a new slipcover on the sofa, swapping out the photos and framed prints that hung on our walls. When the weather turned warm, she did a ritualistic spring cleaning, attacking on all fronts -- vacuuming furniture, laundering curtains, and removing every storm window so she could Windex the glass and wipe down the sills before replacing them with screens to allow the spring air into our tiny, stuffy apartment. She'd then often go downstairs to Robbie and Terry's, particularly as they got older and less able, to scour that as well. It's because of my mother that still to this day I catch the scent of Pine-Sol and automatically feel better about life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="母亲还经常改变我们起居室的布置，换一个新的沙发套，或者换一下墙上挂着的照片和装饰画。天气转暖的时候，她循例会进行一次迎春大扫除，把边边角角都打扫一遍—家具用吸尘器吸一遍，窗帘洗一下，风暴窗都拆下来，用威斯特清洁剂清洗玻璃，打扫窗台，然后换上纱窗，把春天的气息迎进我们狭小拥挤的公寓。她还经常到楼下的萝比和特里家里，把那里也打扫一遍，尤其是在他们年纪渐老、精力不济后。因为母亲的原因，直到今天，我一闻到派素清洁剂的味道，马上就会感觉生活很美好。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In our house, we lived on a budget but didn't often discuss its limits. My mom found ways to compensate. She did her own nails, dyed her own hair (one time accidentally turning it green), and got new clothes only when my dad bought them for her as a birthday gift. She'd never be rich, but she was always crafty. When we were young, she magically turned old socks into puppets that looked exactly like the Muppets. She crocheted doilies to cover our tabletops. She sewed a lot of my clothes, at least until middle school, when suddenly it meant everything to have a Gloria Vanderbilt swan label on the front pocket of your jeans, and I insisted she stop.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们家的日子过得很节省，但我们不常讨论花费超支的问题。母亲总能想到办法来弥补。她自己修指甲，自己染头发（有一次不小心染成了绿色），只在过生日时买新衣服，由父亲买给她作为礼物。她一辈子都不是很有钱，但是心灵手巧。我们小时候，母亲变魔术般地把旧袜子改成布偶，跟《大青蛙布偶秀》里的那些一模一样。我家的桌布是她自己用钩针手工编织的。一直到中学我的很多衣服都是她做的。后来，在牛仔裤前兜上拥有一个凯莱·范德比尔特的“天鹅”标突然变得意义重大，于是我坚持不要她再给我做衣服了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At Christmastime, she got especially creative. One year, she figured out how to cover our boxy metal radiator with corrugated cardboard printed to look like red bricks, stapling everything together so that we'd have a faux chimney that ran all the way to the ceiling and a faux fireplace, complete with a mantel and hearth. She then enlisted my father -- the family's resident artist -- to paint a series of orange flames on pieces of very thin rice paper, which, when backlit with a lightbulb, made for a half-convincing fire. On New Year's Eve, as a matter of tradition, she'd buy a special hors d'oeuvre basket, the kind that came filled with blocks of cheese, smoked oysters in a tin, and different kinds of salami. She'd invite my dad's sister Francesca over to play board games. We'd order a pizza for dinner and then snack our way elegantly through the rest of the evening, my mom passing around trays of pigs in a blanket, fried shrimp, and a special cheese spread baked on Ritz crackers. As midnight drew close, we'd each have a tiny glass of champagne.</div>

<div class="line_en">My mother maintained the sort of parental mind-set that I now recognize as brilliant and nearly impossible to emulate -- a kind of unflappable Zen neutrality. I had friends whose mothers rode their highs and lows as if they were their own, and I knew plenty of other kids whose parents were too overwhelmed by their own challenges to be much of a presence at all. My mom was simply even-keeled. She wasn't quick to judge and she wasn't quick to meddle. Instead, she monitored our moods and bore benevolent witness to whatever travails or triumphs a day might bring. When things were bad, she gave us only a small amount of pity.

I'd gotten my period, which I announced immediately and with huge excitement to everyone in the house, because that was just the kind of household we had. I'd graduated from a training bra to one that looked vaguely more womanly, which also thrilled me. Instead of coming home for lunch, I now ate with my classmates in Mr. Bennett's room at school. Instead of dropping in at Southside's house on Saturdays to listen to his jazz records and play with Rex, I rode my bike right past, headed east to the bungalow on Oglesby Avenue where the Gore sisters lived.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Gore sisters were my best friends and also a little bit my idols. Diane was in my grade, and Pam a grade behind. Both were beautiful girls -- Diane was fair-skinned, and Pam was darker -- each with a kind of self-possessed grace that seemed to come naturally. Even their little sister, Gina, who was a few years younger, emanated a robust femininity that I came to think of simply as Gore-like. Theirs was a home with few men. Their father didn't live there and was rarely discussed. There was one much older brother who was a peripheral presence. Mrs. Gore was an upbeat, attractive woman who worked full-time. She had a makeup table laden with perfume bottles and face powder compacts and various ointments in tiny pots, which given my mother's modest practicality seemed as exotic as jewels to me. I loved spending time at their house. Pam, Diane, and I talked endlessly about which boys we liked. We put on lip gloss and took turns trying on one another's clothes, suddenly aware that certain pairs of pants made our hips look curvier. Much of my energy in those days was spent inside my own head, sitting alone in my room listening to music, daydreaming about a slow dance with a cute boy, or glancing out the window, hoping for a crush to ride his bike down the block. So it was a blessing to have found some sisters to ride through these years with together.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="戈尔姐妹是我最好的朋友，我有点儿崇拜她们。黛安和我同级，帕姆比我们低一级。她们都很漂亮，黛安皮肤偏白一些，帕姆偏黑一点，两人身上都有一种与生俱来的优雅。就连她们的小妹妹吉娜（她比我们还要小几岁）身上也散发着浓浓的女人味，我当时把这种气质归为戈尔家特有的。她们家里几乎没有男人。父亲不和她们住在一起，她们也不怎么提起他。她们有一个年纪比她们大很多的哥哥，也不怎么在家住。戈尔太太是一个乐观向上、富有魅力的女人，做一份全职工作。她的梳妆台上琳琅满目，有各种香水瓶、蜜粉盒和小瓶装的油膏。因为我母亲朴素且讲求实用，所以这些化妆品在我眼里和珠宝一样稀奇。我喜欢在她们家玩。帕姆、黛安和我永远津津乐道的话题是我们喜欢哪个男孩。我们涂上唇膏，还互相试穿对方的衣服，并突然意识到某些牛仔裤更能突显我们的臀部线条。那个时候，我的很多精力都用在想象上，我坐在自己的房间听音乐，想象和一个英俊的男孩跳一支舒缓的舞，或者望着窗外，期待我暗恋的男孩骑车经过。那些年能找到几个姐妹一起度过确实是一件幸事。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Like a lot of girls, I became aware of the liabilities of my body early, long before I began to even look like a woman. I moved around the neighborhood now with more independence, less tied to my parents. I'd catch a city bus to go to late-afternoon dance classes at Mayfair Academy on Seventy-Ninth Street, where I was taking jazz and acrobatics. I ran errands for my mom sometimes. With the new freedoms came new vulnerabilities. I learned to keep my gaze fixed firmly ahead anytime I passed a group of men clustered on a street corner, careful not to register their eyes roving over my chest and legs. I knew to ignore the catcalls when they came. I learned which blocks in our neighborhood were thought to be more dangerous than others. I knew never to walk alone at night.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="和许多女孩一样，早在成熟之前，我就已经意识到自己身体的弱势所在。现在我更多地会单独在社区里活动，而不是和父母一起。下午晚些时候，我会乘公交车去79街上的梅费尔学院上舞蹈课，还有爵士乐和杂技课，有时也会帮妈妈跑腿。与新的自由相伴而来的是新的脆弱。我学会了完全目不斜视地从聚集在街角的一群男人身边走过，不去留意他们打量我胸部和腿的目光，也不去理会他们的口哨声。我还知道了社区哪些地方比较危险，晚上一定不要单独去那里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Boys weren't allowed inside the Gore house, but they buzzed around it like flies. They rode their bikes back and forth on the sidewalk. They sat on the front stoop, hoping Diane or Pam might come out to flirt. It was fun to be around all this expectancy, even as I was unsure of what it all meant. Everywhere I looked, bodies were changing. Boys from school were suddenly man-sized and awkward, their energy twitchy and their voices deep. Some of my girlfriends, meanwhile, looked like they were eighteen, walking around in short-shorts and halter tops, their expressions cool and confident as if they knew some secret, as if they now existed on a different plane, while the rest of us remained uncertain and slightly dumbfounded, waiting for our call-up to the adult world, foal-like on our growing legs and young in a way that no amount of lip gloss could yet fix.</div>

<div class="line_en">At home, my parents made one major concession to the fact they were housing two growing teenagers, renovating the back porch off our kitchen and converting it into a bedroom for Craig, who was now a sophomore in high school. The flimsy partition that Southside had built for us years earlier came down. I moved into what had been my parents' room, they rotated into what had been the kids' room, and for the first time my brother and I had actual space for ourselves. My new bedroom was dreamy, complete with a blue-and-white floral bed skirt and pillow shams, a crisp navy-blue rug, and a white princess-style bed with a matching dresser and lamp -- a near-exact replica of a full-page bedroom layout I'd liked in the Sears catalog and been allowed to get. Each of us was given our own phone extension, too -- my phone was a light blue to match my new decor, while Craig's was a manly black -- which meant we could conduct our personal business semi-privately.</div>

<div class="line_en">I arranged my first real kiss, in fact, over the phone. It was with a boy named Ronnell. Ronnell didn't go to my school or live in my immediate neighborhood, but he sang in the Chicago Children's Choir with my classmate Chiaka, and with Chiaka acting as intermediary, we somehow had decided we liked each other. Our phone calls were a little awkward, but I didn't care. I liked the feeling of being liked. I felt a zing of anticipation every time the phone rang. Could it be Ronnell? I don't remember which one of us proposed that we meet outside my house one afternoon to give kissing a try, but there was no nuance to it; no shy euphemisms needed to be applied. We weren't going to "hang out" or "take a walk." We were going to make out. And we were both all for it.</div>

<div class="line_en">Which is how I landed on the stone bench that sat near the side door of my family's house, in full view of the south-facing windows and surrounded by my great-aunt's flower beds, lost in a warm splishy kiss with Ronnell. There was nothing earth-shattering or especially inspiring about it, but it was fun. Being around boys, I was slowly coming to realize, was fun. The hours I passed watching Craig's games from the bleachers of one gym or another began to feel less like a sisterly obligation. Because what was a basketball game if not a showcase of boys? I'd wear my snuggest jeans and lay on some extra bracelets and sometimes bring one of the Gore sisters along to boost my visibility in the stands. And then I'd enjoy every minute of the sweaty spectacle before me -- the leaping and charging, the rippling and roaring, the pulse of maleness and all its mysteries on full display. When a boy on the JV team smiled at me as he left the court one evening, I smiled right back. It felt like my future was just beginning to arrive.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sometimes in the evenings I'd emerge from brushing my teeth in the bathroom and find the apartment dark, the lights in the living room and kitchen turned off for the night, everyone settled into their own sphere. I'd see a glow beneath the door to Craig's room and know he was doing homework. I'd catch the flicker of television light coming from my parents' room and hear them murmuring quietly, laughing to themselves. Just as I never wondered what it was like for my mother to be a full-time, at-home mother, I never wondered then what it meant to be married. I took my parents' union for granted. It was the simple solid fact upon which all four of our lives were built.</div>

I was caught up in the lonely thrill of being a teenager now, convinced that the adults around me had never been there themselves.</div>

<div class="line_en">Much later, my mother would tell me that every year when spring came and the air warmed up in Chicago, she entertained thoughts about leaving my father. I don't know if these thoughts were actually serious or not. I don't know if she considered the idea for an hour, or for a day, or for most of the season, but for her it was an active fantasy, something that felt healthy and maybe even energizing to ponder, almost as ritual.</div>

Was she picturing herself on a tropical island somewhere? With a different kind of man, or in a different kind of house, or with a corner office instead of kids?

<div class="line_en">If you've never passed a winter in Chicago, let me describe it: You can live for a hundred straight days beneath an iron-gray sky that claps itself like a lid over the city. Frigid, biting winds blow in off the lake. Snow falls in dozens of ways, in heavy overnight dumps and daytime, sideways squalls, in demoralizing sloppy sleet and fairy-tale billows of fluff. There's ice, usually, lots of it, that shellacs the sidewalks and windshields that then need to be scraped. There's the sound of that scraping in the early mornings -- the hack hack hack of it -- as people clear their cars to go to work. Your neighbors, unrecognizable in the thick layers they wear against the cold, keep their faces down to avoid the wind. City snowplows thunder through the streets as the white snow gets piled up and sooty, until nothing is pristine.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果你从未在芝加哥过过冬，那让我来描绘一下：你会连续一百天生活在铁灰色的天空下，就像城市上空盖了一个盖子。湖面上吹来刺骨的寒风。下雪的方式有很多种，夜里下鹅毛大雪，白天是狂风加暴雪，有让人泄气的雨夹雪，还有童话般的漫天飞雪。通常还会结冰，到处都是，连人行道和挡风玻璃也需要融冰。大清早你能听到除冰的声音，“吱吱吱”，那是人们在清除车上的冰，赶着去上班。你的邻居穿着厚厚的御寒衣服，低着头躲避寒风，都认不出来是谁。市政铲雪车在街道上隆隆驶过，白色的雪被堆成乌黑的一堆，最后没有什么是一尘不染的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Eventually, however, something happens. A slow reversal begins. It can be subtle, a whiff of humidity in the air, a slight lifting of the sky. You feel it first in your heart, the possibility that winter might have passed. You may not trust it at the beginning, but then you do. Because now the sun is out and there are little nubby buds on the trees and your neighbors have taken off their heavy coats. And maybe there's a new airiness to your thoughts on the morning you decide to pull out every window in your apartment so you can spray the glass and wipe down the sills. It allows you to think, to wonder if you've missed out on other possibilities by becoming a wife to this man in this house with these children.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，之后人们会察觉到一种变化。缓慢的轮回开始了。变化可能是空气中一丝不易察觉的湿润，是稍稍放晴的天空。你先是在心里感觉到，冬天可能要过去了。开始你可能还不相信，后来就确定了。因为太阳出来了，树上冒出了小小的嫩芽，邻居们也脱下了厚外套。早晨起来，你可能突然有种冲动，决定把房间里所有的窗户都拆下来，清洗玻璃，打扫窗台。你开始想，做这个男人的妻子，住在这所房子里、带着这些孩子，你是否错过了人生的其他可能？">查看中文翻译</div>
