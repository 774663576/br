<div class="line_en">At the sight of Aslan the cheeks of the Telmarine soldiers became the colour of cold gravy, their knees knocked together, and many fell on their faces. They had not believed in lions and this made their fear greater. Even the Red Dwarfs, who knew that he came as a friend, stood with open mouths and could not speak. Some of the Black Dwarfs, who had been of Nikabrik's party, began to edge away. But all the Talking Beasts surged round the Lion, with purrs and grunts and squeaks and whinneys of delight, fawning on him with their tails, rubbing against him, touching him reverently with their noses and going to and fro under his body and between his legs. If you have ever seen a little cat loving a big dog whom it knows and trusts, you will have a pretty good picture of their behaviour. Then Peter, leading Caspian, forced his way through the crowd of animals.</div>

<div class="line_en">For at that moment a curious little procession was approaching -- eleven Mice, six of whom carried between them something on a litter made of branches, but the litter was no bigger than a large atlas. No one has ever seen mice more woebegone than these. They were plastered with mud some with blood too -- and their ears were down and their whiskers drooped and their tails dragged in the grass, and their leader piped on his slender pipe a melancholy tune. On the litter lay what seemed little better than a damp heap of fur; all that was left of Reepicheep. He was still breathing, but more dead than alive, gashed with innumerable wounds, one paw crushed, and, where his tail had been, a bandaged stump.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在这时，一支小小的队伍缓缓走了过来——那是十一只老鼠。其中六只抬着一个树枝编的担架，看不清上面放着什么。鼠勇士们身上全是泥浆和血迹，一个个愁眉苦脸，耷拉着耳朵，低垂的胡子失去了往日的神采，连尾巴也无精打采地拖在草地上。它们的领队用短笛吹奏着一支忧伤的曲子。队伍来到近前，大家这才看清担架上有一小堆湿漉漉的东西，那便是雷佩契普。它身上伤痕累累，一只爪子被踩得粉碎，尾巴也不见了，眼看已经奄奄一息。+">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Lucy had her diamond bottle out in a moment. Though only a drop was needed on each of Reepicheep's wounds, the wounds were so many that there was a long and anxious silence before she had finished and the Master Mouse sprang from the litter. His hand went at once to his sword hilt, with the other he twirled his whiskers. He bowed.</div>

<div class="line_en">The fact was that he still had no tail -- whether that Lucy had forgotten it or that her cordial, though it could heal wounds, could not make things grow again. Reepicheep became aware of his loss as he made his bow; perhaps it altered something in his balance. He looked over his right shoulder. Failing to see his tail, he strained his neck further till he had to turn his shoulders and his whole body followed. But by that time his hind-quarters had turned too and were out of sight. Then he strained his neck looking over his shoulder again, with the same result. Only after he had turned completely round three times did he realize the dreadful truth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="事实上，虽然伤口都已经痊愈，它现在仍然没有尾巴——也许是露茜忘了治疗这一部分，要不然就是她的药水虽然可以治愈伤口却无法使身体失去的部分重新长出来。雷佩契普鞠躬时突然发现自己身上的变化，不由失去了平时的镇定。它越过右肩向身后望去，没有看到自己的尾巴。于是，它又把脖子使劲向后伸去，直到整个身子和臀部都跟着扭动起来，结果仍然看不到自己的尾巴。就这样，它反复看了好几次，终于确信了那可怕的事实。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After this the Telmarine soldiers, firmly but without taunts or blows, were taken across the ford and all put under lock and key in the town of Beruna and given beef and beer. They made a great fuss about wading in the river, for they all hated and feared running water just as much as they hated and feared woods and animals. But in the end the nuisance was over: and then the nicest parts of that long day began.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那些被俘的台尔马士兵被押解过河，囚禁在柏卢纳，每天发给他们牛肉、啤酒，以维持他们的生命。过河费了很大的劲儿，因为那些士兵就像害怕森林一样，也特别仇视、害怕奔流的河水。所以在膛水过河时他们一个个大呼小叫，惊恐万状。不管怎样，该做的事情都做过了。于是，大家开始了这一天中最美好的一段时光。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Lucy, sitting close to Aslan and divinely comfortable, wondered what the trees were doing. At first she thought they were merely dancing; they were certainly going round slowly in two circles, one from left to right and the other from right to left. Then she noticed that they kept throwing something down in the centre of both circles. Sometimes she thought they were cutting off long strands of their hair; at other times it looked as if they were breaking off bits of their fingers -- but, if so, they had plenty of fingers to spare and it did not hurt them. But whatever they were throwing down, when it reached the ground, it became brushwood or dry sticks. Then three or four of the Red Dwarfs came forward with their tinder boxes and set light to the pile, which first crackled, and then blazed, and finally roared as a woodland bonfire on midsummer night ought to do. And everyone sat down in a wide circle round it.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then Bacchus and Silenus and the Maenads began a dance, far wilder than the dance of the trees; not merely a dance for fun and beauty (though it was that too) but a magic dance of plenty, and where their hands touched, and where their feet fell, the feast came into existence sides of roasted meat that filled the grove with delicious smell, and wheaten cakes and oaten cakes, honey and many-coloured sugars and cream as thick as porridge and as smooth as still water, peaches, nectarines, pomegranates, pears, grapes, strawberries, raspberries pyramids and cataracts of fruit. Then, in great wooden cups and bowls and mazers, wreathed with ivy, came the wines; dark, thick ones like syrups of mulberry juice, and clear red ones like red jellies liquefied, and yellow wines and green wines and yellow-green and greenish-yellow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时候，巴库斯、野姑娘和塞利努斯开始翩翩起舞。那是十分奇特的舞蹈，不仅舞姿优美，而且简直是在变魔术——他们的手足所及之处，立即冒出各式各样的美味佳肴：一盘盘烤肉散发出令人馋涎欲滴的香味；各式各样的蛋糕、馅饼和五光十色的糖果更是令人眼花缭乱、目不暇接，还有奶油、蜂蜜、鸭梨、葡萄、草莓、蜜桃、哈蜜瓜……接着，每人面前的草地上出现了一个巨大的木杯或木碗，里面醇香的美酒不时变换着颜色和味道，而且总是喝不完。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But for the tree people different fare was provided. When Lucy saw Clodsley Shovel and his moles scuffling up the turf in various places (which Bacchus had pointed out to them) and realized that the trees were going to eat earth it gave her rather a shudder. But when she saw the earths that were actually brought to them she felt quite different. They began with a rich brown loam that looked almost exactly like chocolate; so like chocolate, in fact, that Edmund tried a piece of it, but he did not find it at all nice. When the rich loam had taken the edge off their hunger, the trees turned to an earth of the kind you see in Somerset, which is almost pink. They said it was lighter and sweeter. At the cheese stage they had a chalky soil, and then went on to delicate confections of the finest gravels powdered with choice silver sand. They drank very little wine, and it made the Hollies very talkative: for the most part they quenched their thirst with deep draughts of mingled dew and rain, flavoured with forest flowers and the airy taste of the thinnest clouds.</div>

<div class="line_en">Thus Aslan feasted the Narnians till long after the sunset had died away, and the stars had come out; and the great fire, now hotter but less noisy, shone like a beacon in the dark woods, and the frightened Telmarines saw it from far away and wondered what it might mean. The best thing of all about this feast was that there was no breaking up or going away, but as the talk grew quieter and slower, one after another would begin to nod and finally drop off to sleep with feet towards the fire and good friends on either side, till at last there was silence all round the circle, and the chattering of water over stone at the Ford of Beruna could be heard once more. But all night Aslan and the Moon gazed upon each other with joyful and unblinking eyes.</div>

<div class="line_en">Next day messengers (who were chiefly squirrels and birds) were sent all over the country with a proclamation to the scattered Telmarines -- including, of course, the prisoners in Beruna. They were told that Caspian was now King and that Narnia would henceforth belong to the Talking Beasts and the Dwarfs and Dryads and Fauns and other creatures quite as much as to the men. Any who chose to stay under the new conditions might do so; but for those who did not like the idea, Aslan would provide another home. Anyone who wished to go there must come to Aslan and the Kings at the Ford of Beruna by noon on the fifth day. You may imagine that this caused plenty of head-scratching among the Telmarines. Some of them, chiefly the young ones, had, like Caspian, heard stories of the Old Days and were delighted that they had come back. They were already making friends with the creatures. These all decided to stay in Narnia. But most of the older men, especially those who had been important under Miraz, were sulky and had no wish to live in a country where they could not rule the roost. "Live here with a lot of blooming performing animals! No fear," they said. "And ghosts too," some added with a shudder. "That's what those there Dryads really are. It's not canny." They were also suspicious. "I don't trust 'em," they said. "Not with that awful Lion and all. He won't keep his claws off us long, you'll see." But then they were equally suspicious of his offer to give them a new home. "Take us off to his den and eat us one by one most likely," they muttered. And the more they talked to one another the sulkier and more suspicious they became. But on the appointed day more than half of them turned up.</div>

<div class="line_en">At one end of the glade Aslan had caused to be set up two stakes of wood, higher than a man's head and about three feet apart. A third, and lighter, piece of wood was bound across them at the top, uniting them, so that the whole thing looked like a doorway from nowhere into nowhere. In front of this stood Aslan himself with Peter on his right and Caspian on his left. Grouped round them were Susan and Lucy, Trumpkin and Trufflehunter, the Lord Cornelius, Glenstorm, Reepicheep, and others. The children and the Dwarfs had made good use of the royal wardrobes in what had been the castle of Miraz and was now the castle of Caspian, and what with silk and cloth of gold, with snowy linen glancing through slashed sleeves, with silver mail shirts and jewelled sword-hilts, with gilt helmets and feathered bonnets, they were almost too bright to look at. Even the beasts wore rich chains about their necks. Yet nobody's eyes were on them or the children. The living and strokable gold of Aslan's mane outshone them all. The rest of the Old Narnians stood down each side of the glade. At the far end stood the Telmarines. The sun shone brightly and pennants fluttered in the light wind.</div>

<div class="line_en">"You, Sir Caspian," said Aslan, "might have known that you could be no true King of Narnia unless, like the Kings of old, you were a son of Adam and came from the world of Adam's sons. And so you are. Many years ago in that world, in a deep sea of that world which is called the South Sea, a shipload of pirates were driven by storm on an island. And there they did as pirates would: killed the natives and took the native women for wives, and made palm wine, and drank and were drunk, and lay in the shade of the palm trees, and woke up and quarrelled, and sometimes killed one another. And in one of these frays six were put to flight by the rest and fled with their women into the centre of the island and up a mountain, and went, as they thought, into a cave to hide. But it was one of the magical places of that world, one of the chinks or chasms between chat world and this. There were many chinks or chasms between worlds in old times, but they have grown rarer. This was one of the last: I do not say the last. And so they fell, or rose, or blundered, or dropped right through, and found themselves in this world, in the Land of Telmar which was then unpeopled. But why it was unpeopled is a long story: I will not tell it now. And in Telmar their descendants lived and became a fierce and proud people; and after many generations there was a famine in Telmar and they invaded Narnia, which was then in some disorder (but that also would be a long story), and conquered it and ruled it. Do you mark all this well, King Caspian?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“凯斯宾国王，”阿斯兰说，“你应该知道，只有像纳尼亚的历代君王一样，身为亚当的儿子，并来自亚当的儿子们的国家，才有资格成为纳尼亚的真正国王。你正是亚当的儿子。很久以前，就在那世界上被称为南海的地方，一船海盗被风暴吹上一座小岛。他们以海盗特有的方式，杀尽了当地的男人，强迫当地的妇女为妻。岛上有自制的椰子酒，他们便终日狂饮，常常喝得酩酊大醉，睡倒在椰子树下，醒来后便互相争吵，甚至自相残杀。一次，其中六个人受到同伴的追杀，带着他们的女人逃到小岛中部的山顶上，躲进一个山洞藏身。没想到那是个魔力山洞，是两个世界之间的通道。古时候曾经有许多类似的通道把两个世界连接起来，可惜如今绝大多数已自动封闭了。他们恰巧钻进了其中的一个。结果，他们飞快地往下沉，或者往上升去。再睁开眼时，他们发现自己已置身于一个陌生的国度——台尔马国。当时这片土地还没有人类的踪迹。这六对男女从此在台尔马定居下来，生儿育女，世代相传，渐渐形成一个凶猛而又骄傲的民族。许多年过去了。有一年，台尔马发生了饥荒，他们便去侵略纳尼亚，占领并统治这个国家直到昨天。凯斯宾国王，这些话你都记下了吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

There are good wells of fresh water, and fruitful soil, and timber for building, and fish in the lagoons; and the other men of that world have not yet discovered it.

<div class="line_en">It was odd, and not very nice, to take off their royal clothes and to come back in their school things (not very fresh now) into that great assembly. One or two of the nastier Telmarines jeered. But the other creatures all cheered and rose up in honour of Peter the High King, and Queen Susan of the Horn, and King Edmund, and Queen Lucy. There were affectionate and (on Lucy's part) tearful farewells with all their old friends -- animal kisses, and hugs from Bulgy Bears, and hands wrung by Trumpkin, and a last tickly, whiskerish embrace with Trufflehunter. And of course Caspian offered the Horn back to Susan and of course Susan told him to keep it. And then, wonderfully and terribly, it was farewell to Aslan himself, and Peter took his place with Susan's hands on his shoulders and Edmund's on hers and Lucy's on his and the first of the Telmarine's on Lucy's, and so in a long line they moved forward to the Door. After that came a moment which is hard to describe, for the children seemed to be seeing three things at once. One was the mouth of a cave opening into the glaring green and blue of an island in the Pacific, where all the Telmarines would find themselves the moment they were through the Door. The second was a glade in Narnia, the faces of Dwarfs and Beasts, the deep eyes of Aslan, and the white patches on the Badger's cheeks. But the third (which rapidly swallowed up the other two) was the grey, gravelly surface of a platform in a country station, and a seat with luggage round it, where they were all sitting as if they had never moved from it -- a little flat and dreary for a moment after all they; had been through, but also, unexpectedly, nice in its own way, what with the familiar railway smell and the English sky and the summer term before them.</div>
