<div class="line_en">Early next morning, Harry woke with a plan fully formed in his mind, as though his sleeping brain had been working on it all night. He got up, dressed in the pale dawn light, left the dormitory without waking Ron, and went back down to the deserted common room. Here he took a piece of parchment from the table upon which his Divination homework still lay and wrote the following letter:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天一早，哈利醒来时，脑子里已经形成了一个完整的计划，就好像他睡着时脑子也没休息，整夜都在盘算这件事。他从床上起来，在黎明苍白的微光中穿好衣服，没有唤醒罗恩，独自离开宿舍，来到空无一人的公共休息室。他昨晚的占卜课家庭作业还留在桌上，他拿起一张羊皮纸，写了下面这封信：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dear Sirius, I reckon I just imagined my scar hurting, I was half asleep when I wrote to you last time. There's no point coming back, everything's fine here. Don't worry about me, my head feels completely normal.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="亲爱的小天狼星：我想，我的伤疤疼大概是心理作用，我上次给你写信时还没有完全睡醒。你没有必要回来，这里一切都好。不要为我担心，我的头一点儿也不疼了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He then climbed out of the portrait hole, up through the silent castle (held up only briefly by Peeves, who tried to overturn a large vase on him halfway along the fourth-floor corridor), finally arriving at the Owlery, which was situated at the top of West Tower.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="随即，他从肖像画后的洞口爬了出去，在寂静的城堡里一直往上走（只被皮皮鬼阻挡了片刻，在五楼的走廊上，皮皮鬼想把一只大花瓶推到他身上），最后来到位于西塔楼最顶层的猫头鹰棚屋。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Owlery was a circular stone room, rather cold and drafty, because none of the windows had glass in them. The floor was entirely covered in straw, owl droppings, and the regurgitated skeletons of mice and voles. Hundreds upon hundreds of owls of every breed imaginable were nestled here on perches that rose right up to the top of the tower, nearly all of them asleep, though here and there a round amber eye glared at Harry. He spotted Hedwig nestled between a barn owl and a tawny, and hurried over to her, sliding a little on the dropping-strewn floor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="棚屋是一个圆形的石头房间，非常阴冷，刮着穿堂风，因为那里的窗户上都没有安玻璃。地板上到处都是稻草和猫头鹰粪便，以及猫头鹰吐出的老鼠和田鼠骨头。在直达塔楼最顶处的栖枝上，栖息着成百上千只猫头鹰，各个品种应有尽有。哈利看见海德薇栖息在一只谷仓猫头鹰和一只黄褐色猫头鹰之间，便匆匆走过去，脚踩在洒满鸟粪的地上差点儿滑倒了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She nipped his finger, perhaps rather harder than she would ordinarily have done, but hooted softly in a reassuring sort of way all the same. Then she spread her wings and took off into the sunrise. Harry watched her fly out of sight with the familiar feeling of unease back in his stomach. He had been so sure that Sirius's reply would alleviate his worries rather than increasing them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="海德薇咬了咬他的手指，也许比平时咬得更用力一些，但它仍然轻轻叫了几声，仿佛是叫他放心。然后，海德薇展开双翅，飞进了晨曦之中。哈利望着它飞得看不见了，内心产生了那种很不踏实的感觉。他一直以为小天狼星的回信肯定会减轻他的担忧，没想到他的担忧反倒增加了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That was a lie, Harry," said Hermione sharply over breakfast, when he told her and Ron what he had done. "You didn't imagine your scar hurting and you know it."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“一定要找到他，好吗？”哈利说，抱着它走向墙上的一个洞口，一边抚摸它的后背，“要赶在摄魂怪前面。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It took him a while to persuade her to wake up and then to look at him, as she kept shuffling around on her perch, showing him her tail. She was evidently still furious about his lack of gratitude the previous night. In the end, it was Harry suggesting she might be too tired, and that perhaps he would ask Ron to borrow Pigwidgeon, that made her stick out her leg and allow him to tie the letter to it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他磨了半天嘴皮子，才说服海德薇醒过来望着自己，因为它不停地在栖枝上移来移去，把尾巴冲着哈利。显然，它还在因为他昨晚不知好歹的表现而生气。最后，哈利说它大概太累了，他最好去向罗恩借来小猪用一下，海德薇这才伸出腿来，让哈利把信栓上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry did his best not to worry about Sirius over the next couple of weeks. True, he could not stop himself from looking anxiously around every morning when the post owls arrived, nor, late at night before he went to sleep, prevent himself from seeing horrible visions of Sirius, cornered by dementors down some dark London street, but betweentimes he tried to keep his mind off his godfather. He wished he still had Quidditch to distract him; nothing worked so well on a troubled mind as a good, hard training session.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在接下来的两个星期里，哈利尽量不去为小天狼星担心。诚然，当每天早晨送信的猫头鹰到来时，他还是忍不住焦虑地东张西望。而每天深夜入睡前，他也无法不让自己幻想小天狼星在伦敦某条阴暗的街道上，被摄魂怪们副得走投无路的可怕情景；不过在整个白天，他还是尽量不去牵挂自己的教父。他真希望他仍然能靠魁地奇转移注意力，没有什么比健康的、大运动量的训练更能排解内心的烦恼焦虑了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He pointed one gnarled finger toward the door. Hermione went very pink and muttered something about not meaning that she wanted to leave. Harry and Ron grinned at each other. They knew Hermione would rather eat bubotuber pus than miss such an important lesson.</div>

He had had much more difficulty with the curse than Harry, though Moody assured him the effects would wear off by lunchtime. "Talk about paranoid…" Ron glanced nervously over his shoulder to check that Moody was definitely out of earshot and went on. "No wonder they were glad to get shot of him at the Ministry. Did you hear him telling Seamus what he did to that witch who shouted 'Boo' behind him on April Fools' Day? And when are we supposed to read up on resisting the Imperius Curse with everything else we've got to do?"</div>
