<div class="line_en">Drouet did not call that evening. After receiving the letter, he had laid aside all thought of Carrie for the time being and was floating around having what he considered a gay time. On this particular evening he dined at "Rector's," a restaurant of some local fame, which occupied a basement at Clark and Monroe Streets. There -- after he visited the resort of Fitzgerald and Moy's in Adams Street, opposite the imposing Federal Building. There he leaned over the splendid bar and swallowed a glass of plain whiskey and purchased a couple of cigars, one of which he lighted. This to him represented in part high life -- a fair sample of what the whole must be.</div>

<div class="line_en">Drouet was not a drinker in excess. He was not a moneyed man. He only craved the best, as his mind conceived it, and such doings seemed to him a part of the best. Rector's, with its polished marble walls and floor, its profusion of lights, its show of china and silverware, and, above all, its reputation as a resort for actors and professional men, seemed to him the proper place for a successful man to go. He loved fine clothes, good eating, and particularly the company and acquaintanceship of successful men. When dining, it was a source of keen satisfaction to him to know that Joseph Jefferson was wont to come to this same place, or that Henry E. Dixie, a well-known performer of the day, was then only a few tables off. At Rector's he could always obtain this satisfaction, for there one could encounter politicians, brokers, actors, some rich young "rounders" of the town, all eating and drinking amid a buzz of popular commonplace conversation.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杜洛埃不是嗜酒如命的人，也不是富人。他只是按照他的理解，追求着高雅生活。目前这些享受在他看来就算得上高级了。他认为雷克脱饭店是功成名就的人应该光顾的地方，因为那里不仅有光滑的大理石墙壁和地板，有无数灯火和值得炫耀的瓷器和银器，更重要的是，有名演员和企业家光顾的名声：他喜欢美食华服，也喜欢和名人要人结识为伍。吃饭时，如果他听说约瑟夫·杰佛生也常到这家饭店吃饭，或者听说当时正走红的演员亨利·易·狄克西就在旁边的餐桌，和他相隔没有几张桌子，这会给他带来极大的满足。在雷克脱饭店，他经常可以得到这类的满足，因为人们可以见到政界要人、经纪人，演员之类和城里那些年轻有钱的花花公子们在那里吃喝，聊天，说些通常的热门话题。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">His preference for Fitzgerald and Moy's Adams Street place was another yard off the same cloth. This was really a gorgeous saloon from a Chicago standpoint. Like Rector's, it was also ornamented with a blaze of incandescent lights, held in handsome chandeliers. The floors were of brightly coloured tiles, the walls a composition of rich, dark, polished wood, which reflected the light, and coloured stucco-work, which gave the place a very sumptuous appearance. The long bar was a blaze of lights, polished woodwork, coloured and cut glassware, and many fancy bottles. It was a truly swell saloon, with rich screens, fancy wines, and a line of bar goods unsurpassed in the country.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他喜欢光顾亚当街上的费莫酒家，也是出于同一个原因。以芝加哥的水平看，这实在是一家豪华大酒家。像雷克脱饭店一样，店堂里一盏盏美丽的枝形大吊灯大放光明，把酒家点缀得艳丽典雅。地上铺的是色彩鲜艳的瓷砖，墙壁则是用彩色涂料和贵重的深色木料镶嵌而成，涂了清漆的木料在灯光反射下熠熠生辉，彩色涂料则显得豪华富丽。一排电灯照在抛光的长酒柜台上，上面陈列着彩色雕花的玻璃器皿和许多形状奇特的酒瓶。这真是第一流的酒家，具有昂贵的帘幕，珍奇的名酒，和在全国堪称一绝的酒柜器皿。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Hurstwood looked the part, for, besides being slightly under forty, he had a good, stout constitution, an active manner, and a solid, substantial air, which was composed in part of his fine clothes, his clean linen, his jewels, and, above all, his own sense of his importance. Drouet immediately conceived a notion of him as being some one worth knowing, and was glad not only to meet him, but to visit the Adams Street bar thereafter whenever he wanted a drink or a cigar.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="赫斯渥看上去也像个春风得意的人物。他四十不到，体格健壮，举止活跃，一副殷实富有的气派。这种气派部分是由于他服装考究，衬衫干净，身上珠光宝气，不过最重要的是由于他自知身价。杜洛埃马上意识到这是个值得结识的人物。他不仅很高兴认识他，而且从那以后，每当他想来杯酒，或者来根雪茄时，他一定光顾亚当街的这家酒吧。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Hurstwood was an interesting character after his kind. He was shrewd and clever in many little things, and capable of creating a good impression. His managerial position was fairly important -- a kind of stewardship which was imposing, but lacked financial control. He had risen by perseverance and industry, through long years of service, from the position of barkeeper in a commonplace saloon to his present altitude. He had a little office in the place, set off in polished cherry and grill-work, where he kept, in a roll-top desk, the rather simple accounts of the place -- supplies ordered and needed. The chief executive and financial functions devolved upon the owners -- Messrs. Fitzgerald and Moy -- and upon a cashier who looked after the money taken in.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可以说，赫斯渥天生是个十分有趣的人物。在许多小事上，他精明干练，能够给人留下好印象。他的经理职位是相当重要的——总管一切，发号施令，不过没有经济实权。他是靠坚持不懈，勤勤恳恳起家的。从一个普通酒店的酒保，经过多年的努力，升到他目前的职位。在这个酒家，他有一个小办公室，是用抛光的樱桃木和花格架隔出的小间。里面有一张翻盖写字桌，保存着酒店的简单账目，不外乎是已订购或还需订购的食物和杂品。主要的行政和财务职责是两个店主费茨杰拉德和莫埃加上一个管收钱的现金出纳负责的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For the most part he lounged about, dressed in excellent tailored suits of imported goods, a solitaire ring, a fine blue diamond in his tie, a striking vest of some new pattern, and a watch-chain of solid gold, which held a charm of rich design, and a watch of the latest make and engraving. He knew by name, and could greet personally with a "Well, old fellow," hundreds of actors, merchants, politicians, and the general run of successful characters about town, and it was part of his success to do so. He had a finely graduated scale of informality and friendship, which improved from the "How do you do?" addressed to the fifteen-dollar-a-week clerks and office attaches, who, by long frequenting of the place, became aware of his position, to the "Why, old man, how are you?" which he addressed to those noted or rich individuals who knew him and were inclined to be friendly. There was a class, however, too rich, too famous, or too successful, with whom he could not attempt any familiarity of address, and with these he was professionally tactful, assuming a grave and dignified attitude, paying them the deference which would win their good feeling without in the least compromising his own bearing and opinions. There were, in the last place, a few good followers, neither rich nor poor, famous, nor yet remarkably successful, with whom he was friendly on the score of good-fellowship. These were the kind of men with whom he would converse longest and most seriously. He loved to go out and have a good time once in a while -- to go to the races, the theatres, the sporting entertainments at some of the clubs. He kept a horse and neat trap, had his wife and two children, who were well established in a neat house on the North Side near Lincoln Park, and was altogether a very acceptable individual of our great American upper class -- the first grade below the luxuriously rich.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大部分时间里，他在店里悠闲地走动，身上穿的是用进口衣料精工制作的高级服装，戴着单粒钻石戒指，领带上别着一颗漂亮的蓝钻石，引人注目的新潮西装背心，一条足金表链，表链上挂着个造型精巧的小饰物和一个最新款式的挂表。他认识成百上千演员、商人、政界人物和一般吃得开的成功人物，叫得出他们的名字，并能用“喂，老兄”和他们亲热地寒暄，这是他获得成功的部分原因。他待人接物，严格掌握亲热随便的分寸。对于那些周薪15元左右，经常光顾他的酒家因而知道他在店里的地位的小职员和跟班，他用“你好”来打招呼；对于那些认识他并愿意和他交往的名人和有钱人，他用“怎么样，老兄，还好吧”来打招呼。不过对那些太有钱，太有名，或者太成功之辈，他不敢用亲密随便的口气称呼。跟这些人打交道，他使出职业上的圆活手段，用一种庄重和尊严的态度，对他们表示敬意。这种敬意既可赢得他们的好感，又不损他自己的举止和自尊。最后，有那么几个好主顾，既不穷又不富，有名气，又不太成功。和这些人他用的是一种老朋友的友好态度，和他们长时间的恳切交谈。他喜欢隔些天就出去散散心——去赛马场，剧院，参加某些俱乐部的娱乐活动。他养着一匹马，还有一辆轻便马车。他已婚，有了两个孩子，住在靠近林肯公园的北区一幢精美的房子里。总的来说，是我们美国上流社会中一个不讨人厌的人物，比豪富略逊一筹。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Hurstwood liked Drouet. The latter's genial nature and dressy appearance pleased him. He knew that Drouet was only a travelling salesman -- and not one of many years at that -- but the firm of Bartlett, Caryoe &amp; Company was a large and prosperous house, and Drouet stood well. Hurstwood knew Caryoe quite well, having drunk a glass now and then with him, in company with several others, when the conversation was general. Drouet had what was a help in his business, a moderate sense of humour, and could tell a good story when the occasion required. He could talk races with Hurstwood, tell interesting incidents concerning himself and his experiences with women, and report the state of trade in the cities which he visited, and so managed to make himself almost invariably agreeable. To-night he was particularly so, since his report to the company had been favourably commented upon, his new samples had been satisfactorily selected, and his trip marked out for the next six weeks.</div>

<div class="line_en">To one not inclined to drink, and gifted with a more serious turn of mind, such a bubbling, chattering, glittering chamber must ever seem an anomaly, a strange commentary on nature and life. Here come the moths, in endless procession, to bask in the light of the flame. Such conversation as one may hear would not warrant a commendation of the scene upon intellectual grounds. It seems plain that schemers would choose more sequestered quarters to arrange their plans, that politicians would not gather here in company to discuss anything save formalities, where the sharp- eared may hear, and it would scarcely be justified on the score of thirst, for the majority of those who frequent these more gorgeous places have no craving for liquor. Nevertheless, the fact that here men gather, here chatter, here love to pass and rub elbows, must be explained upon some grounds. It must be that a strange bundle of passions and vague desires give rise to such a curious social institution or it would not be.</div>

<div class="line_en">Drouet, for one, was lured as much by his longing for pleasure as by his desire to shine among his betters. The many friends he met here dropped in because they craved, without, perhaps, consciously analysing it, the company, the glow, the atmosphere which they found. One might take it, after all, as an augur of the better social order, for the things which they satisfied here, though sensory, were not evil. No evil could come out of the contemplation of an expensively decorated chamber. The worst effect of such a thing would be, perhaps, to stir up in the material-minded an ambition to arrange their lives upon a similarly splendid basis. In the last analysis, that would scarcely be called the fault of the decorations, but rather of the innate trend of the mind. That such a scene might stir the less expensively dressed to emulate the more expensively dressed could scarcely be laid at the door of anything save the false ambition of the minds of those so affected. Remove the element so thoroughly and solely complained of -- liquor -- and there would not be one to gainsay the qualities of beauty and enthusiasm which would remain. The pleased eye with which our modern restaurants of fashion are looked upon is proof of this assertion.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="拿杜洛埃来说，他来这里，不单纯是为了寻欢作乐，也是为了能跻身在境遇比他强的人们中间摆摆阔。他在这里遇到的许多朋友也许自己也没有下意识地分析过，他们来这里是渴望这里的社交，灯光和气氛。毕竟，人们可以把到这里来看作是领略上流社会生活。他们到这里来，追求的虽然是感官的满足，毕竟算不得邪恶。期望到一间装饰豪华的房子来玩玩，不会产生多少坏处。这类事最大的坏影响也许是在物质欲强烈的人身上激起一种过同样奢华生活的野心。归根到底，这也怪不得豪华布置的本身，要怪得怪人的天性。这种场合诱使衣着一般的人眼红衣着阔气的人，于是他们也想穿阔气衣服，不过这怪不得旁的，只能怪那些受了影响的人不该有这些不实际的野心。把酒这个遭人非议和怪罪的因素去掉，那么没有人会否认酒店具有华丽和热情两大气质。我们现代时髦的大饭店以其赏心悦目而大得青睐，就是明证。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你看到那边刚进来的人吗？”赫斯渥朝那个刚进来的人瞥了一眼。那人戴着礼帽，穿着双排扣长礼服，他的鼓鼓的胖脸由于生活优裕而显得红光满面。">查看中文翻译</div>

Under the stars and sweeping night winds, what a lamp-flower it must bloom; a strange, glittering night-flower, odour-yielding, insect-drawing, insect-infested rose of pleasure.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，这些明亮的店堂，穿着华丽的贪婪人群，浅薄自私的聊天，和这一切反映的混乱迷茫和喱徨的精神状态，都是出于对灯光，排场和华服美饰的爱慕。对一个置身于永恒宁静的星光下的局外人来说，这一切一定显得光怪陆离。在星光下，酒店就像一朵灯光构成的鲜花，在夜风里盛开，一种只在夜间开放的奇异璀璨的花朵，一朵散发着芬芳，招引着昆虫，又被昆虫侵害的欢乐玫瑰。">查看中文翻译</div>
