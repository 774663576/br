<div class="line_en">I know old Jane like a book -- I still couldn't get her off my brain. I knew her like a book. I really did. I mean, besides checkers, she was quite fond of all athletic sports, and after I got to know her, the whole summer long we played tennis together almost every morning and golf almost every afternoon. I really got to know her quite intimately. I don't mean it was anything physical or anything -- it wasn't -- but we saw each other all the time. You don't always have to get too sexy to get to know a girl.</div>

<div class="line_en">All of sudden, on my way out to the lobby, I got old Jane Gallagher on the brain again. I got her on, and I couldn't get her off. I sat down in this vomity-looking chair in the lobby and thought about her and Stradlater sitting in that goddam Ed Banky's car, and though I was pretty damn sure old Stradlater hadn't given her the time --</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一霎时，在我出去到休息室的半路上，我脑子里忽然又想起老琴。迦拉格来。她进了我的脑子，却再也不肯出去。所以我就在那令人作呕的休息室椅子上坐下，又想起她跟斯特拉德莱塔一块儿坐在埃德。班基那辆混帐汽车里的事来，虽然我他妈的十分肯定老斯特拉德莱塔没法儿跟她干那事儿――。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The way I met her, this Doberman pinscher she had used to come over and relieve himself on our lawn, and my mother got very irritated about it. She called up Jane's mother and made a big stink about it. My mother can make a very big stink about that kind of stuff. Then what happened, a couple of days later I saw Jane laying on her stomach next to the swimming pool, at the club, and I said hello to her. I knew she lived in the house next to ours, but I'd never conversed with her before or anything. She gave me the big freeze when I said hello that day, though. I had a helluva time convincing her that I didn't give a good goddam where her dog relieved himself. He could do it in the living room, for all I cared.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我认识她的经过是因为她家的那只德国种猎狗老在我家草地上拉屎。我母亲为这事十分生气。她去找了琴的妈，闹得很不愉快。过了一两天，我在俱乐部里遇见了琴，看见她合扑着卧在游泳池旁边，就跟她打了个招呼。我知道她就住在我家隔壁，可我以前从来没跟她说过话。那天我跟她打招呼的时候，她对我冷得象块冰。我真他妈的费了不少工夫踞她解释，说我他妈的才不管她的狗在哪儿拉屎哩。对我来说，它就是到我家的客厅里来拉屎都成。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Anyway, after that, Jane and I got to be friends and all. I played golf with her that same afternoon. She lost eight balls, I remember. Eight. I had a terrible time getting her to at least open her eyes when she took a swing at the ball. I improved her game immensely, though. I'm a very good golfer. If I told you what I go around in, you probably wouldn't believe me. I almost was once in a movie short, but I changed my mind at the last minute. I figured that anybody that hates the movies as much as I do, I'd be a phony if I let them stick me in a movie short.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="嗯，这以后，琴就跟我做了朋友。那天下午我就跟她一块儿去打高尔夫球。她失了八个球，我记得。八个。我费了很大工夫，才教会她在开球的时候至少张开跟睛。她在我的帮助下球艺进步得很快。我自己高尔夫球打得极好。要是我告诉你经过情形，你大概不会相信。我有一次差点儿给拍进了电影，是那种体育短片，可我最后一分钟改变了主意。我揣摩象我这样一个痛恨电影的人，要是让他们把我拍成短片，岂不成了真正的伪君子了？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She was a funny girl, old Jane. I wouldn't exactly describe her as strictly beautiful. She knocked me out, though. She was sort of muckle-mouthed. I mean when she was talking and she got excited about something, her mouth sort of went in about fifty directions, her lips and all. That killed me. And she never really closed it all the way, her mouth. It was always just a little bit open, especially when she got in her golf stance, or when she was reading a book. She was always reading, and she read very good books. She read a lot of poetry and all. She was the only one, outside my family, that I ever showed Allie's baseball mitt to, with all the poems written on it. She'd never met Allie or anything, because that was her first summer in Maine -- before that, she went to Cape Cod -- but I told her quite a lot about him. She was interested in that kind of stuff.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她是个可笑的姑娘，那个琴。我并不打算把她说成地道的美人。可她的确让我神魂颠倒。她可以说是个花嘴姑娘。我的意思是说她只要一讲话，加上心里激动，她的嘴和嘴唇就会向五十个方向动。这简直要了我的命。而她也从来不把嘴闭得紧紧的。那张嘴总是微微张开一点，尤其是她摆好姿势要打高尔夫球或者是她在看书的时候。她老是在看书，看的都是些非常好的书。她还读过不少诗。艾里那只写着诗的垒球手套除了我家里的人以外，我只给她一个人看过。她从来没见过艾里，因为她还是第一次到缅因来度暑假――以前的暑假，她都到鳘鱼角去――可我把他的事情跟她讲了许多。她对这类事儿很感兴趣。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I remember this one afternoon. It was the only time old Jane and I ever got close to necking, even. It was a Saturday and it was raining like a bastard out, and I was over at her house, on the porch -- they had this big screened-in porch. We were playing checkers. I used to kid her once in a while because she wouldn't take her kings out of the back row. But I didn't kid her much, though. You never wanted to kid Jane too much. I think I really like it best when you can kid the pants off a girl when the opportunity arises, but it's a funny thing. The girls I like best are the ones I never feel much like kidding. Sometimes I think they'd like it if you kidded them -- in fact, I know they would -- but it's hard to get started, once you've known them a pretty long time and never kidded them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我记得有一天下午的事。那是唯一的一次琴跟我两人接近于搂搂抱抱地胡搞。那天是星期六，外面正下着瓢泼大雨，我恰好在她家里的廊子上一一他们有那种装着纱窗的大廊子。我们俩在一块儿下棋。我偶尔也拿她取笑，因为她总不肯把那些国王从后排拿出来使用。可我也并不把她取笑得太厉害。你是决不会想把琴取笑得太厉害的。我觉得我自己确实很喜欢一有机会，就把一个姑娘取笑得面红耳赤，可好笑的是，那些我最最喜欢的姑娘，我却不想拿她们取笑。有时候我觉得你拿她们取笑以后，她们反倒高兴――事实上，我知道她们是会高兴的――可你一旦跟她们相处久了，平时从来没拿她们取笑过，那简直很难开始。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">My mother didn't like her too much. I mean my mother always thought Jane and her mother were sort of snubbing her or something when they didn't say hello. My mother saw them in the village a lot, because Jane used to drive to market with her mother in this LaSalle convertible they had. My mother didn't think Jane was pretty, even. I did, though. I just liked the way she looked, that's all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我母亲不怎么喜欢琴。我是说琴和她妈妈见了我母亲老是不跟她打招呼，我母亲就以为她的是故意怠慢她。我母亲经常在村里遇见她们，因为琴常常开着她们那辆拉萨尔敞篷汽车跟她母亲一起上市场。我母亲甚至都不以为琴长得漂亮。我呢，当然认为她漂亮。我就喜欢她长的那个模样儿，就是那么回事。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Anyway, I was telling you about that afternoon Jane and I came close to necking. It was raining like hell and we were out on her porch, and all of a sudden this booze hound her mother was married to came out on the porch and asked Jane if there were any cigarettes in the house. I didn't know him too well or anything, but he looked like the kind of guy that wouldn't talk to you much unless he wanted something off you. He had a lousy personality.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="嗯，我打算告诉你的，是那天下午琴跟我怎样接近于搂搂抱抱地胡搞。天正下着倾盆大雨，我们都在外面的廊子上，刹那间跟她母亲结婚的那个酒鬼出来到廊子上，问琴家里还有香烟没有。我跟他不很熟，不过从外表看，他很象那种不太爱理人的家伙，除非是他有求于你。他有种极讨厌的个性。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Anyway, old Jane wouldn't answer him when he asked her if she knew where there was any cigarettes. So the guy asked her again, but she still wouldn't answer him. She didn't even look up from the game. Finally the guy went inside the house. When he did, I asked Jane what the hell was going on. She wouldn't even answer me, then. She made out like she was concentrating on her next move in the game and all. Then all of a sudden, this tear plopped down on the checkerboard. On one of the red squares -- boy, I can still see it. She just rubbed it into the board with her finger. I don't know why, but it bothered hell out of me. So what I did was, I went over and made her move over on the glider so that I could sit down next to her -- I practically sat down in her lap, as a matter of fact. Then she really started to cry, and the next thing I knew, I was kissing her all over -- anywhere -- her eyes, her nose, her forehead, her eyebrows and all, her ears -- her whole face except her mouth and all. She sort of wouldn't let me get to her mouth. Anyway, it was the closest we ever got to necking. After a while, she got up and went in and put on this red and white sweater she had, that knocked me out, and we went to a goddam movie. I asked her, on the way, if Mr. Cudahy -- that was the booze hound's name -- had ever tried to get wise with her. She was pretty young, but she had this terrific figure, and I wouldn't've put it past that Cudahy bastard. She said no, though. I never did find out what the hell was the matter. Some girls you practically never find out what's the matter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="嗯，他问琴知不知道哪儿有香烟，琴却不回答他。因此那家伙又问了她一遍，她依旧不回答他。她甚至都没从棋盘上抬起头来。最后那家伙走进屋去了。他进去后，我就问琴他妈的到底是怎么回事。当时她甚至都不肯回答我。她假装着好象在集中注意思考下一步棋应该怎么走。接着突然间，那颗泪珠儿啪的一下掉到棋盘上了。正好掉在一个红方格上――嘿，我这会儿还看得见哩。她只是用手一擦，把那颗泪珠儿擦进了棋盘。我不知怎的，觉得心里极不对劲儿。我于是走过去让她在她坐的那把长椅上挪出些位置，好让我坐在她身旁――事实上我简直就坐在她怀里。接着她真的哭了起来，我呢，只知道在她脸上狂吻――一切地方――她的眼睛，她的鼻子，她的前额，她的眉毛，她的耳朵，――她整个的脸，除了她嘴上一带。她仿佛不让我吻她的嘴。不管怎样，这是我们俩最接近于搂搂抱抱地胡搞的一次。过一会儿，她起身进去，换上件红白两色的运动衫，就是我见了最神魂颠倒的那一件，于是我们俩一块儿去看混帐电影了。在路上，我问她古达罕先生――就是那酒鬼的名字――可曾对她不规矩过。她年纪还很轻，可她有那种极好的身段，所以换了我，就决不会让她呆在古达罕那杂种的身旁。不过她说他没有。我怎么也弄不明白这他妈的是怎么回事。有些女孩子你简直怎么也弄不明白究竟是怎么回事。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I don't want you to get the idea she was a goddam icicle or something, just because we never necked or horsed around much. She wasn't. I held hands with her all the time, for instance. That doesn't sound like much, I realize, but she was terrific to hold hands with. Most girls if you hold hands with them, their goddam hand dies on you, or else they think they have to keep moving their hand all the time, as if they were afraid they'd bore you or something. Jane was different. We'd get into a goddam movie or something, and right away we'd start holding hands, and we wouldn't quit till the movie was over. And without changing the position or making a big deal out of it. You never even worried, with Jane, whether your hand was sweaty or not. All you knew was, you were happy. You really were.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我希望你不要仅仅因为我们不在一起搂搂抱抱地胡搞，就把她看成是他妈的冰棍什么的。她才不蠢呢。我就老跟她握手，比如说。这听起来好象没什么，我知道，可你跟她握起手来却是滋昧无穷。大多数的姑娘你要是握住她们的手，她们那只混帐的手就会死在你的手里，要不然她们就觉得非把自己的手动个不停不可，好象生怕让你觉得腻烦似的。琴可不一样。我们进了一个混帐电影院什么的，就马上握起手来，直到电影演完才放开，既不改变手的位置，也不拿手大做文章。跟琴握手，你甚至都不会担心自己的手是不是在出汗。你只知道自已很快乐。你的确很快乐。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One other thing I just thought of. One time, in this movie, Jane did something that just about knocked me out. The newsreel was on or something, and all of a sudden I felt this hand on the back of my neck, and it was Jane's. It was a funny thing to do. I mean she was quite young and all, and most girls if you see them putting their hand on the back of somebody's neck, they're around twenty-five or thirty and usually they're doing it to their husband or their little kid -- I do it to my kid sister Phoebe once in a while, for instance. But if a girl's quite young and all and she does it, it's so pretty it just about kills you.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我刚想起另一件事。有一次，在电影院里，琴干了一件事，差点儿让我的灵魂儿都出了窍。好象还是在放映新闻片的时候，我突然觉得有只手搭在我脖子后面，那是琴的手。干这样的事说来确实是很可笑。就是说她还那么年轻，而你瞧见的那些把手搭在别人脖子后面的姑娘，多半都是在二十五岁到三十岁之间，而且对方不是她们的丈夫便是她们的孩子――比如说，我自己就偶尔把手搭在我小妹妹菲芘的脖子后面。可是遇到一个年轻的姑娘干这样的事，那真是别有滋味，简直叫你销魂。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was hardly anybody in the lobby any more. Even all the whory-looking blondes weren't around any more, and all of a sudden I felt like getting the hell out of the place. It was too depressing. And I wasn't tired or anything. So I went up to my room and put on my coat. I also took a look out the window to see if all the perverts were still in action, but the lights and all were out now. I went down in the elevator again and got a cab and told the driver to take me down to Ernie's. Ernie's is this night club in Greenwich Village that my brother D. B. used to go to quite frequently before he went out to Hollywood and prostituted himself. He used to take me with him once in a while. Ernie's a big fat colored guy that plays the piano. He's a terrific snob and he won't hardly even talk to you unless you're a big shot or a celebrity or something, but he can really play the piano. He's so good he's almost corny, in fact. I don't exactly know what I mean by that, but I mean it. I certainly like to hear him play, but sometimes you feel like turning his goddam piano over. I think it's because sometimes when he plays, he sounds like the kind of guy that won't talk to you unless you're a big shot.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="休息室里已经没有人。连所有那些婊子样的女人也都不在了，忽然间我觉得自己非他妈的离开这地方不可了。这地方实在太叫人泄气了。不过我还一点不觉得困。因此我上楼回到自己房里，穿上大衣。我还往窗外眺望了一下，看看所有那些心理变态的人是不是还在行动，却见对面房里全都熄灯了。我又乘电梯下去，叫了辆出租汽车，要司机送我去“欧尼”。“欧尼”是格林威治村里的一个夜总会，我哥哥DB还没到好莱坞去当婊子之前常去那地方，他偶尔也带我去过几次。开夜总会的欧尼是个又高又胖的黑人，会弹钢琴。这家伙势利得要命，见了人甚至都不肯理睬，除非你是个大人物或者名人或者别的什么。可他的钢琴确实弹得好，事实上好得都有点流于粗俗了。我自己也不太清楚我说这话是什么意思，可我说的是心里话。我确实喜欢听他演奏。不过有时候你真想把他那架混帐钢琴翻个个儿。我想那是因为他有时候弹起钢琴来，听去就象那种势利鬼，除非你是大人物就不肯理睬你。">查看中文翻译</div>

Every time I got to the part about her out with Stradlater in that damn Ed Banky's car, it almost drove me crazy. I knew she wouldn't let him get to first base with her, but it drove me crazy anyway. I don't even like to talk about it, if you want to know the truth.</div>
