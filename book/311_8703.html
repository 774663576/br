<div class="line_en">Park had spent all day trying to think of how to get away from the new girl. He'd have to switch seats. That was the only answer. But switch to what seat? He didn't want to force himself on somebody else. And even the act of switching seats would catch Steve's attention.</div>

<div class="line_en">She didn't talk to him on the ride home.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="回家的车上，她没跟他说话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Park had expected Steve to start in on him as soon he let the girl sit down, but Steve had gone right back to talking about kung fu again. Park, by the way, knew plenty about kung fu. Because his dad was obsessed with martial arts, not because his mom was Korean. Park and his little brother, Josh, had been taking taekwando since they could walk.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="帕克让那女孩坐到旁边时就预料到史蒂夫会找他麻烦，谁知史蒂夫还在继续谈着功夫。哦，顺便说一下，帕克很懂功夫，这跟他妈妈是韩国人无关，而是因为他爸爸热衷武术。帕克和弟弟乔许刚会走路，便被送去学了跆拳道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He could probably find a seat up front with the freshmen, but that would be a spectacular show of weakness. And he almost hated to think about leaving the weird new girl at the back of the bus by herself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="或许可以换到前面跟新生坐，但这样又会大大显示他的懦弱。他也讨厌想象那个新来的怪女孩孤单地坐在后面的场面。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">If his dad knew he was thinking like this, he'd call Park a pussy. Out loud, for once. If his grandma knew, she'd smack him on the back of the head. "Where are you manners?" she'd say. "Is that any way to treat somebody who's down on her luck?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果爸爸知道他的想法，肯定会骂他像个娘们儿。终于让他逮到机会大声说出这个词了。如果让奶奶知道了，肯定会赏他脑瓜子一巴掌。她会说，你的绅士风度呢？你应该这样对待不幸的人吗？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But Park didn't have any luck -- or status -- to spare on that dumb redhead. He had just enough to keep himself out of trouble. And he knew it was crappy, but he was kind of grateful that people like that girl existed. Because people like Steve and Mikey and Tina existed, too, and they needed to be fed. If it wasn't that redhead, it was going to be somebody else. And if it wasn't somebody else, it was going to be Park.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="以他的地位和运气，只够明哲保身，不足以罩着那个红发女孩。他知道自己的想法很差劲，但是他衷心庆幸世间有红发女孩这类人物，因为史蒂夫、米基、提娜这类人需要生吞活剥的对象，如果没有红发女孩，就会是别人；如果没有别人，就会是帕克。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="上午，史蒂夫放了他一马，但他可不会永远放过他…">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Park could hear his grandma again. "Seriously, son, you're giving yourself a stomach ache because you did something nice while other people were watching?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="帕克几乎又听到奶奶在说，说真的，孩子，大家都在袖手旁观的时候，做一件好事又能怎么样呢？难道会让你肚子疼？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It wasn't even that nice, Park thought. He'd let the girl sit down, but he'd sworn at her. When she showed up in his English class that afternoon, it felt like she was there to haunt him…</div>

<div class="line_en">When the girl showed up in history, Mr Sanderhoff didn't make a scene. But he did say, "Ah. Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine," when she handed him her paperwork. She sat down a few rows ahead of Park and, as far as he could tell, spent the whole period staring at the sun.</div>

<div class="line_en">"That was wonderful," Mr Stessman said when she was done. He was beaming. "Just wonderful. I hope you'll stay with us, Eleanor, at least until we do Medea. That's a voice that arrives on a chariot drawn by dragons."</div>
