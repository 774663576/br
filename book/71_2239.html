<div class="line_en">The following morning, when Dantès returned to the cell of his fellow-prisoner, he found him sitting up, his face calm. In the sole ray of light that penetrated through the narrow window of his cell, he was holding something in his left hand -- the only one, it will be remembered, that he could still use. It was an open sheet of paper which had been so long tightly rolled up that it was still resistant to being flattened. Saying nothing, he showed it to Dantès.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天早晨，当邓蒂斯回到他的狱中同伴的房间里的时候，他看见法利亚坐在那儿，神色看上去很是安宁。他的左手（要记得，他只有这一只手可以用了）举在射进地窖小窗口的那线阳光里，手里拿着一小片纸，这片纸因为一直被卷着塞在一个小地方，所以变成了一个圆柱形，很不容易打开。他不说话，只把那张纸给邓蒂斯看。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“看呀。”长老微笑着说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dantès felt a cold sweat on his forehead. Until now (and for how long!) he had refrained from speaking with Faria about this treasure, the origin of the charge of madness levelled against the poor abbé. With instinctive tact, Edmond preferred not to touch on this tender spot, and Faria, for his part, had said nothing. He took the old man's silence to mean that he had regained his reason; but now, these few words, which had escaped Faria's lips after such a desperate crisis, seemed to imply a serious relapse into a state of mental alienation.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="邓蒂斯的额头冒出一阵冷汗。到这一天为止——经过了多长的一个期间呀！——他始终避免和长老谈及他的宝藏，因为这是他疯狂的病根。生性谨慎的爱德蒙处处留意，避免触及这条痛苦的心弦，而法利亚在这一方面也同样保持着沉默。他把老人的这种沉默认为是理智的恢复，而现在，法利亚在经过了这样痛苦的一场剧变以后又吐出了这些话，似乎等于宣布他又神经错乱了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Faria smiled and said: "Yes. Edmond, your heart is noble in every respect and I realize, from your pallor and the shudder that you gave, what you are thinking. No, have no fear, I am not mad. This treasure exists, Dantès, and if I am unable to possess it, you shall. No one wished to listen to me or to believe me because they assumed I was mad. But you, who must know that I am not, listen to me, and afterwards believe me or not as you will."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="法利亚微笑了一下。“是的，”他说。“你的心地的确很高尚，爱德蒙。因为我从你脸色的苍白和发抖看出了你此刻心中在想些什么。不，你放心，我没有疯。这个宝藏是存在的，邓蒂斯。假如我不能去占有它，你却可以。是的，你。谁都不肯听我的话，谁都不相信我，因为他们以为我是疯子。但是你，你一定知道我并没有疯，假如你肯听我的话，你一定会相信的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

Why not rest a little? Tomorrow, if you wish, I shall listen to your story, but today I want to nurse you back to health, nothing more. In any case," he said, smiling, "are we in a hurry to find a treasure here?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“糟糕！”爱德蒙喃喃地对自己说，“他的旧病又复发了！我本来就差没遇上这桩横祸了。”然后他大声说，“我亲爱的朋友，你发病以后大概很疲倦了，你先休息一会儿不好吗？假如你高兴，明天我再来听你讲。但今天我希望能小心地看护你。而且，”他说，“宝藏对我们并不是很急迫的事呀。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Very much so, Edmond," the old man replied. "Who knows if tomorrow, or perhaps the next day, I shall have my third seizure? In that case, all would be finished! Yes, it's true, I have often thought with bitter delight of these riches, which would make the fortune of ten families, knowing that they are beyond the reach of my persecutors: that idea was my revenge, and I savoured it slowly in the darkness of my cell and the despair of my imprisonment. But now, out of love for you, I have forgiven the world, and now that I see you young, with your future before you, now that I think of all the happiness that such a revelation can bring you, I am impatient of delay and tremble at the idea that I might not be able to give all this buried wealth to so worthy an owner as you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这是非常急迫的，爱德蒙！”老人回答说。“谁知道我的病会不会在明天或后天再发第三次呢？那时就一切都完啦。这些财宝可使十多家人家变成巨富，我常常想，就让它永远埋没吧，决不让那些迫害我的人得到它，每有这种想法，心里虽不免带点苦味，却还觉得相当畅快。这种想法也在向我报复，我在这黑牢的夜里，在这囚徒生活的绝望中，正在慢慢地尝它的滋味。但是现在，我已为了对你的爱宽恕了世界。现在，我看到你很年轻，而且充满着希望和远景。我想，这个秘密一经泄露，你就可以得到一切幸福，——我深怕再迟延一分钟一秒钟，深怕失掉象你这样可敬的一个人来拥有这样庞大的宝藏。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Faria received him sitting down, was careful to avoid any compromising movement and managed to conceal the deadly paralysis that had already stricken one half of his body. He was afraid that the governor might take pity on him and put him in some more healthy cell, thus separating him from his young companion. Luckily this was not the case and the governor left, convinced that his poor madman, for whom in the depths of his heart he felt some degree of affection, was only suffering from a slight indisposition.</div>

<div class="line_en">Meanwhile Edmond was sitting on his bed with his head in his hands and trying to collect his thoughts. Since he had first met Faria, everything about the man had spoken of such reasoning, such grandeur, such logical consistency, that he could not understand how this supreme wisdom over all others could be combined with unreason about this one single matter: was it that Faria was wrong about his treasure, or that everyone else was wrong about Faria?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但在这时，爱德蒙却坐在他的床上，用双手捧着头，竭力在聚精会神地回想。自从他认识法利亚以来，一切觉得他是这样的理智和伟大，这样的崇高，他不懂为什么一个在各方面都这样富于智慧的人竟会在某一点上发了疯。究竟是法利亚被他的宝藏所迷了呢，还是全世界都不了解法利亚？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dantès remained in his cell the whole day, not daring to return to his friend's. In this way he was trying to delay the moment when he would learn for certain that the abbé was mad: such a certainty would be appalling to him.</div>

<div class="line_en">Towards evening, however, after the time of the jailer's customary visit, when the young man did not return, Faria tried to make his way across the space between them. Edmond shuddered on hearing the old man's painful efforts to drag himself along: his leg was immobile and he could not use one of his arms. Edmond was obliged to pull him into his cell, because he could never otherwise have managed to force himself through the narrow opening by his own efforts.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但到傍晚时分，在例常的查看以后，法利亚不见青年到来，就尝试由自己来越过那一段分隔他们的距离。他的一条腿已经不能动弹，一只手臂也已不能再用，所以只能拖着身子过来。爱德蒙一听到老人那种痛苦挣扎的声音，不禁打了一个寒颤。他不得不勉强迎上前去，因为否则老人就无法从那通邓蒂斯房间的小洞口里进来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You know that I used to be the secretary, the intimate and the friend of Cardinal Spada, last prince of that name. To this worthy lord I owe all the happiness that I have tasted in this life. He was not rich, even though his family's wealth was proverbial and I have often heard people say: 'As rich as a Spada'. But, like the proverb, he lived on this reputation for opulence. His palace was paradise to me. I taught his nephews, who died, and when he was alone in the world, I repaid him for all that he had done for me during the previous ten years by my absolute dedication to fulfilling his every wish."</div>

The Pope also needed money if he was to have done with Louis XII, king of France, who was still a threat despite his recent defeats. It was essential for him to speculate successfully and this was no longer easy in the poor, exhausted land of Italy. His Holiness had an idea. He resolved to create two cardinals.'"</div>

<div class="line_en">"The Pope and Cesare Borgia first found their two future cardinals: they were Giovanni Rospigliosi, who alone had at his disposal four of the highest offices of the Holy See; and Cesare Spada, one of the richest men, from one of the most noble families in Rome.

<div class="line_en">"By choosing two of the leading men in Rome, and above all two wealthy men, the Holy Father could expect the following from his speculation: firstly, he would have at his disposal the high offices and magnificent titles that these two cardinals possessed; and, secondly, he could count on a splendid price for the sale of the two cardinals' hats. There was also a third source of income, which will soon appear."</div>

<div class="line_en">"The Holy Father and his son argued over the matter. Cesare thought that they could employ one of those devices which he always kept at the disposal of his intimate friends, for example, the famous key with which certain people would be asked to go and open a particular wardrobe. The key happened to have a little point of iron negligently left sticking out of it by the locksmith. When anyone pressed it, in order to open the wardrobe -- the lock was stiff -- he would be pricked by this little pin and would die the following day. There was also the lion's-head ring, which Cesare wore on his finger to shake certain people by the hand. The lion bit the skin of these specially favoured hands and the bite would prove fatal within twenty-four hours."</div>

The first person who met his eyes was his own nephew, elegant and finely dressed, the object of Cesare Borgia's affectionate attentions.

<div class="line_en">"They dined. Spada found the opportunity only to ask his nephew whether he had received the message. The nephew replied that he had not, and he fully appreciated the sense of the question; it was too late, for he had just drunk a glass of excellent wine set aside for him by the Pope's vintner. At the same moment, Spada saw another bottle being brought, from which he was offered a liberal quantity. An hour later a doctor declared that both of them had been poisoned by some lethal mushrooms. Spada died at the entrance to the vineyard, while the nephew breathed his last at his own door, making a sign to his wife which she did not understand."</div>

From the time when Christianity, that great civilizing influence, brought enlightenment to Rome, it was no longer a matter of a centurion who would come from the tyrant and announce: Caesar wishes you to die.

However, I had read -- I even wrote one myself -- a precise, almost a day-by-day history of the Borgias, for no other reason than to discover whether these princes had acquired any additional fortune on the death of my cardinal, Cesare Spada, and I only noted the addition to their riches of the money belonging to Cardinal Rospigliosi, his companion in misfortune."</div>

In any case, this was something to which I should have to resign myself in future. In one hand I took a candle and in the other, knowing that there were no matches in their box, I looked for a piece of paper that I could light from the last embers burning in the grate. But I was afraid that, in the darkness, I would take some precious leaf of paper instead of a useless one, so I hesitated. Then I remembered that, in the famous breviary, which was sitting on the table beside me, I had seen an old piece of paper, partly yellowed with age, which appeared to serve as a bookmark and which had been handed down as such through the ages, preserved by the veneration of Cardinal Spada's heirs. I groped around for this useless scrap, found it, folded it and thrust it into the dying fire to light it."</div>

Then, with feelings I cannot describe, I re-opened the crumpled letter and realized that there were words on it written by some mysterious, invisible ink, which became visible only on contact with heat. About one-third of the paper had been consumed by the flames. This is the paper that you read this morning. Read it again, Dantès, and when you have done so, I shall fill in whatever is missing or unclear."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Impossible? Why impossible?" the old man asked. "The Spadas were one of the oldest and most powerful families of the fifteenth century.

<div class="line_cn" title="“太不可能！为什么？”老人问。“斯巴达这一族人是十五世纪时历史最悠久，而且最有势力的诸大家之一。而在那个时代，各种投机事业和工业都还没有兴起，所以积藏那些金银珠宝是并不为奇的。就是在目前，罗马有几族人饿都快饿死了，可是他们手里还有价值百万的钻石珠宝，那是当作传家之宝历代传下来的，他们是不能动的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
