<div class="line_en">My friend Bongani was a short, bald, super-buff guy. He wasn't always that way. His whole life he'd been skinny, and then a bodybuilding magazine found its way into his hands and changed his life. Bongani was one of those people who brought out the best in everybody. He was that friend who believed in you and saw the potential in you that nobody else did, which was why so many of the township kids gravitated toward him, and why I gravitated toward him as well. Bongani was always popular, but his reputation really took off when he beat up one of the more infamous bullies in the school. That cemented his status as sort of the leader and protector of the township kids.</div>

<div class="line_en">Bongani lived in Alex, but I never visited him there while we were still in school; he'd always come to my house in Highlands North. I'd been to Alex a few times, for brief visits, but I'd never spent any real time there. I'd never been there at night, let's put it that way. Going to Alex during the day is different from going there at night. The place was nicknamed Gomorrah for a reason.</div>

<div class="line_en">The walls of apartheid were coming down just as American hip-hop was blowing up, and hip-hop made it cool to be from the hood. Before, living in a township was something to be ashamed of; it was the bottom of the bottom. Then we had movies like Boyz n the Hood and Menace II Society, and they made the hood look cool. The characters in those movies, in the songs, they owned it. Kids in the townships started doing the same, wearing their identity as a badge of honor: You were no longer from the township -- you were from the hood. Being from Alex gave you way more street cred than living in Highlands North. So when Bongani said, "Let's go to the hood," I was curious about what he meant. I wanted to find out more.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="种族隔离的墙倒塌之时，正是美国嘻哈音乐蓬勃发展的时刻，而在嘻哈文化里，来自“街区”是一件很酷的事。在此之前，住在黑人小镇是一件令人羞耻的事，那是社会底层的最底层。但后来，我们看到了像《街区男孩》《威胁2：社会》这样的电影，黑人小镇都被塑造得特别酷。这些电影的主角们，包括主题歌，都以此为傲。小镇的孩子们也开始有样学样，以自己的身份出处为傲：你不再是来自小镇的人了——你来自街区。而住在亚历山德拉，能让你比住在高地北获得更高的街头信誉。所以当邦哈尼说“咱们去街区玩吧”时，我很好奇他到底是什么意思。我想了解更多。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When Bongani took me to Alex we entered as most people do, from the Sandton side. You ride through one of the richest neighborhoods in Johannesburg, past palatial mansions and huge money. Then you go through the industrial belt of Wynberg that cordons off the rich and white from the poor and black. At the entrance to Alex there's the huge minibus rank and the bus station. It's the same bustling, chaotic third-world marketplace you see in James Bond and Jason Bourne movies. It's Grand Central Station but outdoors. Everything's dynamic. Everything's in motion. Nothing feels like it was there yesterday, and nothing feels like it will be there tomorrow, but every day it looks exactly the same.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="邦哈尼带我到亚历山德拉后，我们像大多数人那样，从桑顿区那一侧穿进去，经过了约翰内斯堡最富有的生活区，经过了宫殿般的豪宅和金山银山，然后又穿过了韦恩堡这条工业隔离带，富有白人和贫穷黑人的世界，就是从这里分界的。在进入亚历山德拉的入口处，列着一排长长的迷你小巴，以及一个巴士站。这是你会在007电影或《谍影重重》里见到的那种熙熙攘攘、混乱不堪的第三世界市集。这里就是中央车站，只不过是在户外。一切都生机勃勃，一切都在飞速运转。好像这里没有什么存在于昨日，也没有什么能持续到明天，但每天都是完全一样的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Once you go past the minibus rank, you're in Alex proper. I've been in few places where there's an electricity like there is in Alex. It's a hive of constant human activity, all day long, people coming and going, gangsters hustling, guys on the corner doing nothing, kids running around. There's nowhere for all that energy to go, no mechanism for it to dissipate, so it erupts periodically in epic acts of violence and crazy parties. One minute it'll be a placid afternoon, people hanging out, doing their thing, and next thing you know there's a cop car chasing gangsters, flying through the streets, a gun battle going off, helicopters circling overhead. Then, ten minutes later, it's like it never happened -- everyone's back to hanging out, back to the hustle, coming and going, running around.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一旦经过小巴的队列，你就真正进入亚历山德拉了。我从未在其他地方感受过像亚历山德拉这样的紧张活力。这里简直是人类的蜂巢，人们在这里一刻不停地来来去去，黑帮在争夺地盘，路人在街角无所事事，小孩到处乱跑。由于这些高度集中的能量无处发泄，没有机制可令其自然消解，所以这里会周期性地爆发大规模的暴力事件，亦或是极度疯狂的派对。在一分钟以前，这还是一个平静的下午，人们在四处闲逛，干着自己的事，突然之间，警车和黑帮就开始上演追逐火拼大戏，车辆在街道上飞驰，枪声不绝于耳，直升机出现在头顶盘旋。十分钟后，这一切又好像从未发生过——所有人又开始闲逛着做自己的事了，熙熙攘攘，来来去去，东奔西跑着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Right next to the minibus rank, of course, is a KFC. That's one thing about South Africa: There's always a KFC. KFC found the black people. KFC did not play games. They were in the hood before McDonald's, before Burger King, before anyone. KFC was like, "Yo, we're here for you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在迷你小巴的旁边，当然，是一家肯德基。这是南非的一个特点：到处都有肯德基。肯德基拥抱了黑人兄弟。肯德基不玩花头。他们早早地在街区里扎了根，在麦当劳之前，在汉堡王之前，在所有人之前。肯德基好像在说：“哟，我们在这里，正是为你而来。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As you walk, there's every smell you can imagine. People are cooking, eating takeaways in the streets. Some family has a shack that's jury-rigged onto the back of someone else's shack, and they don't have any running water, so they've bathed in a bucket from the outdoor tap and then dumped the dirty water in the street, where it runs into the river of sewerage that's already there because the water system has backed up again. There's a guy fixing cars who thinks he knows what he's doing, but he doesn't. He's dumping old motor oil into the street, and now the oil is combining with the dirty bathwater to make a river of filth running down the street. There's probably a goat hanging around -- there's always a goat. As you're walking, sound washes over you, the steady thrum of human activity, people talking in a dozen different languages, chatting, haggling, arguing. There's music playing constantly. You've got traditional South African music coming from one corner, someone blasting Dolly Parton from the next corner, and somebody driving past pumping the Notorious B. I. G.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="走在街区，你可以闻到你能想到的所有气味，譬如烧菜的味道，街边外卖的味道。有的人家的棚屋就临时搭在别人家的棚屋后面，他们没有自来水，所以他们从户外的水龙头接水，用桶洗澡，洗后的脏水就直接泼在街上，这些脏水会自动汇入街面上那条污水溪流里——因为这里的下水系统又堵了。有人在修车，他以为自己知道自己在干什么，实际上却一窍不通。他把旧机油倾倒在街面上，现在机油和洗澡水混在一起，组成了一条脏河，在街面上潺潺流动。应该还会有一只山羊在旁边踱步——不知为何，那里总会有一只山羊。你一边走着，音浪向你袭来，人类活动的稳定节拍，人们用十几种不同语言对话、闲聊、争论、吵架。每时每刻都有音乐声。你会听到某个角落里播着传统南非音乐，另一个角落大声放着桃莉·巴顿，而一辆车呼啸而过，留下一串震天响的克里斯托弗·华莱士的节奏鼓点。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Alex is laid out on a grid, a series of avenues. The streets are paved, but the sidewalks are mostly dirt. The color scheme is cinder block and corrugated iron, gray and dark gray, punctuated by bright splashes of color. Someone's painted a wall lime green, or there's a bright-red sign above a takeaway shop, or maybe somebody's picked up a bright-blue piece of sheet metal just by luck. There's little in the way of basic sanitation. Trash is everywhere, typically a garbage fire going down some side street. There's always something burning in the hood.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="亚历山德拉这个地方被许多条街道划分成网格状。马路的路面铺过沥青，但是人行道基本就是土路。整个城市的色彩主题，是煤渣砖和波状钢的颜色，灰色和深灰色，间或点缀着跳跃的明艳色彩。有人会把自己的墙漆成柠檬绿色，外卖店门口会立着一个亮红色的招牌，也许有人凑巧捡到一片天蓝色的金属钢片。整座城市的卫生条件很差，到处都是垃圾，总是有人在某条巷子里烧垃圾。在街区里，任何时候都有什么东西在燃烧。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The hood was a complete sensory overload for me, but within the chaos there was order, a system, a social hierarchy based on where you lived. First Avenue was not cool at all because it was right next to the commotion of the minibus rank. Second Avenue was nice because it had semi-houses that were built when there was still some sort of formal settlement going on. Third, Fourth, and Fifth Avenues were nicer -- for the township. These were the established families, the old money. Then from Sixth Avenue on down it got really shitty, more shacks and shanties. There were some schools, a few soccer fields. There were a couple of hostels, giant projects built by the government for housing migrant workers. You never wanted to go there. That's where the serious gangsters were. You only went there if you needed to buy an AK-47.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对我来说，街区实在是一个感官超负荷的存在，但是在它的嘈杂之中，又隐含了一种秩序，一种社会系统，一种会依据你所居住的位置而划分的社会分阶标准。一街很差，因为它紧挨着混乱的小巴站。二街还不错，那里有一些以前这里还算正规居民区时留下的洋房。三街、四街和五街就更好了——对于这个小镇来说。那里聚集了一些大家族，都是有祖传基业的。从六街开始，情况又急转直下，棚户和临时屋逐渐增多。那里有几所学校和几个足球场，还有几个给外来打工人员盖的招待所，算是大规模的政府项目。你不会想去那边，那是黑帮的地盘。你只有在需要买一把AK—47步枪的时候，才会造访那片土地。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After Twentieth Avenue you hit the Jukskei River, and on the far side of that, across the Roosevelt Street Bridge, was East Bank, the newest, nicest part of the hood. East Bank was where the government had gone in, cleared out the squatters and their shacks, and started to build actual homes. It was still low-income housing, but decent two-bedroom houses with tiny yards. The families who lived there had a bit of money and usually sent their kids out of the hood to better schools, like Sandringham. Bongani's parents lived in East Bank, at the corner of Roosevelt and Springbok Crescent, and after walking from the minibus rank through the hood, we wound up there, hanging around outside his house on the low brick wall down the middle of Springbok Crescent, doing nothing, shooting the shit. I didn't know it then, but I was about to spend the next three years of my life hanging out at that very spot.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="过了二十街后，你会来到朱科斯凯河畔，过了罗斯福桥，走到河对岸，就来到了整个亚历山德拉最新、最好的地方，名为东岸。那是政府规划的地方，他们清理了非法占地者和棚屋，在那里建起了真正的房子。虽然仍是给低收入家庭的房子，但起码是像样的两卧带小花园的小洋房。住在那边的家庭通常都有一点儿积蓄，会把孩子送到街区以外更好的地方去上学，譬如桑德林汉姆。邦哈尼的父母就住在东岸，罗斯福路和跳羚弯的交界处。从小巴站穿过整个街区后，我和邦哈尼来到东岸，在他家门口的跳羚弯路中间的矮砖墙上玩起来，无所事事，吹吹牛皮。我那时还不知道，未来的三年，我都会在这个地方度过。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Another nice thing about the hood was that it's super cheap. You can get by on next to nothing. There's a meal you can get in the hood called a kota. It's a quarter loaf of bread. You scrape out the bread, then you fill it with fried potatoes, a slice of baloney, and some pickled mango relish called achar. That costs a couple of rand. The more money you have, the more upgrades you can buy. If you have a bit more money you can throw in a hot dog. If you have a bit more than that, you can throw in a proper sausage, like a bratwurst, or maybe a fried egg. The biggest one, with all the upgrades, is enough to feed three people.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="街区还有一个好处，就是东西超级便宜，生活花销极少。你可以在街区买到一种叫柯塔的食物，它的外壳是四分之一条面包，把面包芯挖出来，再往里面放入炸土豆、一片熏肠和一种叫“阿査”的腌渍芒果泡菜。这一整套只需要几兰特。而你钱越多，就可以有更多的升级选择。譬如你的预算稍有富裕，那么可以往里面加个热狗。如果还有更多的钱，可以加个香肠，譬如德国碎肉肠，或者一个煎蛋。而最豪华的版本，就是把能加的都加了，足够填饱三个人的肚子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I graduated from high school when I was seventeen, and by that point life at home had become toxic because of my stepfather. I didn't want to be there anymore, and my mom agreed that I should move out. She helped me move to a cheap, roach-infested flat in a building down the road. My plan, insofar as I had one, was to go to university to be a computer programmer, but we couldn't afford the tuition. I needed to make money. The only way I knew how to make money was selling pirated CDs, and one of the best places to sell CDs was in the hood, because that's where the minibus rank was. Minibus drivers were always looking for new songs because having good music was something they used to attract customers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="17岁那年，我从高中毕业，那时我的家已经变成了一个很可怕的地方，因为继父的关系。我不想再在家里住了，我妈同意后，我搬了出去。她帮我搬去了道路尽头的一栋楼，我在那找了一个满是蟑螂的便宜公寓。那时我的计划——如果说我有计划的话——就是去上大学，以后做一名电脑程序员，但是我们付不起学费，我得还钱。我知道的唯一的赚钱方法就是卖盗版碟，卖盗版碟最好的地方就是在街区，因为那里有小巴。而小巴司机总是在找新歌，播放好音乐是他们招揽乘客的手段之一。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For us, the ultimate upgrade was to throw on a slice of cheese. Cheese was always the thing because it was so expensive. Forget the gold standard -- the hood operated on the cheese standard. Cheese on anything was money. If you got a burger, that was cool, but if you got a cheeseburger, that meant you had more money than a guy who just got a hamburger. Cheese on a sandwich, cheese in your fridge, that meant you were living the good life. In any township in South Africa, if you had a bit of money, people would say, "Oh, you're a cheese boy." In essence: You're not really hood because your family has enough money to buy cheese.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对我们来说，终极升级版就是在上面加一片芝士。芝士是精华，因为它好贵。不用想什么金本位制了，街区信奉的是芝士本位制。在任何东西上加芝士都意味着钱。如果你有个汉堡，那很不错，但如果你有的是芝士汉堡，那就意味着你比那个买火腿汉堡的人更有钱。三明治上加芝士，冰箱里有芝士，这都表明你的生活水平不错。在南非的任何小镇上，只要你有点儿钱，人们都会说：“哦哟，你是个芝士男孩。”言下之意是，你不是真的街区人，因为你的家庭有钱买芝士。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In Alex, because Bongani and his crew lived in East Bank, they were considered cheese boys. Ironically, because they lived on the first street just over the river, they were looked down on as the scruff of East Bank and the kids in the nicer houses higher up in East Bank were the cheesier cheese boys. Bongani and his crew would never admit to being cheese boys. They would insist, "We're not cheese. We're hood." But then the real hood guys would say, "Eh, you're not hood. You're cheese." "We're not cheese," Bongani's guys would say, pointing further up East Bank. "They're cheese." It was all a bunch of ridiculous posturing about who was hood and who was cheese.</div>

<div class="line_en">The unemployment rate, technically speaking, was "lower" in South Africa during apartheid, which makes sense. There was slavery -- that's how everyone was employed. When democracy came, everyone had to be paid a minimum wage. The cost of labor went up, and suddenly millions of people were out of work. The unemployment rate for young black men post-apartheid shot up, sometimes as high as 50 percent. What happens to a lot of guys is they finish high school and they can't afford university, and even little retail jobs can be hard to come by when you're from the hood and you look and talk a certain way. So, for many young men in South Africa's townships, freedom looks like this: Every morning they wake up, maybe their parents go to work or maybe not. Then they go outside and chill on the corner the whole day, talking shit. They're free, they've been taught how to fish, but no one will give them a fishing rod.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="严格来说，种族隔离时期的失业率反而要“低一些”，这是说得通的。因为有奴隶制度——人们就是像这样被雇佣的。而实现民主以后，法律规定所有人都要拿最低基本工资。雇佣劳动力的成本上去了，一夜之间，几百万人面临失业。种族隔离结束后，年轻黑人的失业率急速上涨，有时甚至能达到50%。很多人的情况是，高中毕业后付不起大学的学费，甚至连一个零售的工作都找不到，因为你来自街区，你的长相和说话方式都带着街区的味道。于是，对于很多生活在南非小镇的青年人来说，自由是这样的：每天早晨醒来，可能父母去上班了，也可能没去。他们就走出门，整天泡在街角玩，吹牛皮。他们是自由的，虽然他们已经被“授之以渔”，但是没人给他们钓鱼竿。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In the hood, gangsters were your friends and neighbors. You knew them. You talked to them on the corner, saw them at parties. They were a part of your world. You knew them from before they became gangsters. It wasn't, "Hey, that's a crack dealer." It was, "Oh, little Jimmy's selling crack now." The weird thing about these gangsters was that they were all, at a glance, identical. They drove the same red sports car. They dated the same beautiful eighteen-year-old girls. It was strange. It was like they didn't have personalities; they shared a personality. One could be the other, and the other could be the one. They'd each studied how to be that gangster.</div>

<div class="line_en">My life of crime started off small, selling pirated CDs on the corner. That in itself was a crime, and today I feel like I owe all these artists money for stealing their music, but by hood standards it didn't even qualify as illegal.

It's everyone from the mom buying some food that fell off the back of a truck to feed her family, all the way up to the gangs selling military-grade weapons and hardware. The hood made me realize that crime succeeds because crime does the one thing the government doesn't do: crime cares. Crime is grassroots. Crime looks for the young kids who need support and a lifting hand. Crime offers internship programs and summer jobs and opportunities for advancement. Crime gets involved in the community. Crime doesn't discriminate.</div>

<div class="line_en">The garage of Bongani's house opened up onto Springbok Cresent. Every morning we'd open the doors, run an extension cord out into the street, set up a table, and play music. People would walk by and ask, "What is that? Can I get one, please?" Our corner was also where a lot of minibus drivers ended their routes and turned around to loop back to the minibus rank. They'd swing by, place an order, come back, pick it up. Swing by, place an order, come back, pick it up. We spent our whole day running out to them, going back to the garage to make more mixes, and going back out to sell. There was a converted shipping container around the corner where we'd hang out when we got tired of the wall. It had a pay phone installed inside that we'd use to call people. When things were slow we'd wander back and forth between the container and the wall, talking and hanging out with the other people with nothing to do in the middle of the day. We'd talk to drug dealers, talk to gangsters. Every now and then the cops would come crashing through. A day in the life of the hood. Next day, same thing.</div>

<div class="line_en">We started making more money. Never more than a few hundred, maybe a thousand rand at a time, but it was all cash on hand. Bongani was quick to realize the position we were in. Cash is the one thing everyone in the hood needs. Everyone's looking for a short-term loan for something, to pay a bill or pay a fine or just hold things together. People started coming to us and asking for money. Bongani would cut a deal, and then he'd come to me. "Yo, we're going to make a deal with this guy. We're going to loan him a hundred, and he's going to give us back one-twenty at the end of the week." I'd say okay. Then the guy would come back and give us 120 rand. Then we did it again. Then we did it some more. We started to double our money, then triple our money.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们挣的钱越来越多。尽管每次也不过几百兰特，最多一千兰特，但那都是实实在在攥在手里的现金。邦哈尼立刻意识到我们所处的地位。街区里的每个人都需要现金。每个人都在寻找短期借贷，来付一笔账单，交一笔罚款，或贴补家用。邦哈尼会出去谈生意，然后回来找我：“哟，我们可以和这个家伙做笔交易，我们借给他100块，这周末他还我们120。”我会说好的。然后那个人周末回来还给我们120兰特，我们再重复这个流程，再借更多钱出去。我们的财富开始呈两倍、三倍地增长。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Selling slowly evolved into hustling because Bongani saw all the angles and knew how to exploit them. Like Tom, Bongani was a hustler. But where Tom was only about the short con, Bongani had schemes: If we do this, we get that, then we can flip that for the other thing, which gives us the leverage we need to get something bigger. Some minibus drivers couldn't pay up front, for example. "I don't have the money, because I've just started my shift," they'd say. "But I need new music. Can I owe you guys some form of credit? I'll owe you a ride. I'll pay you at the end of my shift, at the end of the week?" So we started letting drivers buy on credit, charging them a bit of interest.</div>

<div class="line_en">We made some of the craziest trades. Moms in the hood are protective of their daughters, especially if their daughters are pretty. In Alex there were girls who got locked up. They went to school, came straight home, and went straight into the house. They weren't allowed to leave. Boys weren't allowed to talk to them, weren't even allowed to hang around the house -- none of that. Some guy was always going on about some locked-away girl: "She's so beautiful. I'll do anything to get with her." But he couldn't. Nobody could.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="比如我们曾经做了好几笔疯狂的交易。街区里的妈妈们都很宝贝她们的女儿，尤其是漂亮女儿。在亚历山德拉，很多女孩儿是被锁在家里的。她们会去上学，放学后直接回家，直接进屋，再也不许出门。男孩子也不许跟她们讲话，甚至都不能在她们家门口徘徊——什么都不能。有些男生总是梦想和这些锁在家里的女孩儿们交往：“她太美了，如果能和她在一起，我什么都愿意做。”但是他没法和她在一起。没有人可以。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After lunch we'd head back to the garage, relax, sleep off the meal, and make more CDs. In the afternoons we'd see a lot of moms. Moms loved us. They were some of our best customers. Since moms run the household, they're the ones looking to buy that box of soap that fell off the back of the truck, and they were more likely to buy it from us than from some crackhead. Dealing with crackheads is unpleasant. We were upstanding, well-spoken East Bank boys. We could even charge a premium because we added that layer of respectability to the transaction. Moms are also often the most in need of short-term loans, to pay for this or that for the family. Again, they'd rather deal with us than with some gangster loan shark. Moms knew we weren't going to break anyone's legs if they couldn't pay. We didn't believe in that. Also we weren't capable of it -- let's not forget that part. But that's where Bongani's brilliance came in. He always knew what a person could provide pending their failure to pay.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吃过午饭，我们回到车库，放松一会儿，小睡一会儿，接着继续刻碟。到了下午，我们会遇见很多的妈妈们。妈妈们超爱我们，她们是我们最好的客户。因为妈妈们要管家，一直期待能买到那种从卡车后面滑落的成箱肥皂，而且比起和瘾君子打交道，她们更愿意从我们手上买。和瘾君子打交道并不是什么舒心的经历，而我们是正直、文雅的东岸男孩。我们甚至可以要更高的价格，因为我们的身份给这场交易蒙上了一层体面的光。妈妈们也很需要短期借贷，家里的各项支出都急需现金。同样，她们更愿意和我们做交易，而不愿去找那些放高利贷的黑帮。妈妈们知道，即使她们没还上钱，我们也不会打断任何人的腿。我们并不信奉暴力，另外我们也没那个能力——可别忘了这一点。这个时候，邦哈尼的聪明才智又要发挥用场了，他总是清楚当一个人付不出钱的时候，可以让他拿什么来抵债。">查看中文翻译</div>

We had our stockpile of Jordans and DVD players we'd bought to resell. We also had to buy blank CDs, hire minibuses to go to our DJ gigs, feed five guys three times a day.

There'd be a guy selling a cellphone, a guy selling some leather jackets, a guy selling shoes. There was this one dude who looked like a black version of Mr. Burns from The Simpsons.

Gunshots went off every night, and we'd always try to guess what kind of gun it was. "That's a nine-millimeter." Usually there'd be a police chase, cop cars flying through after some guy with a stolen car. Then everyone would go home for dinner with their families.

I was out there every day from seven a. m. to seven p. m., and every day it was: How do we turn ten rand into twenty? How do we turn twenty into fifty? How do I turn fifty into a hundred? At the end of the day we'd spend it on food and maybe some beers, and then we'd go home and come back and it was: How do we turn ten into twenty? How do we turn twenty into fifty? It was a whole day's work to flip that money. You had to be walking, be moving, be thinking. You had to get to a guy, find a guy, meet a guy.

When I look back on it, that's what hustling was. It's maximal effort put into minimal gain. It's a hamster wheel. If I'd put all that energy into studying I'd have earned an MBA.

<div class="line_en">I lost the hard drive. Even though the cop shot the monitor the explosion somehow fried the thing. The computer would still boot up, but it couldn't read the drive. My music library was gone. Even if I'd had the money for a new hard drive, it had taken me years to amass the music collection. There was no way to replace it. The DJ'ing business was over. The CD-selling business was done. All of a sudden our crew lost its main revenue stream. All we had left was the hustle, and we hustled even harder, taking the bit of cash we had on hand and trying to double it, buying this to flip it for that.

<div class="line_en">It's such a strange thing, but in two years of hustling I never once thought of it as a crime. I honestly didn't think it was bad. It's just stuff people found. White people have insurance. Whatever rationalization was handy. In society, we do horrible things to one another because we don't see the person it affects. We don't see their face. We don't see them as people. Which was the whole reason the hood was built in the first place, to keep the victims of apartheid out of sight and out of mind. Because if white people ever saw black people as human, they would see that slavery is unconscionable. We live in a world where we don't see the ramifications of what we do to others, because we don't live with them. It would be a whole lot harder for an investment banker to rip off people with subprime mortgages if he actually had to live with the people he was ripping off. If we could see one another's pain and empathize with one another, it would never be worth it to us to commit the crimes in the first place.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这真的很奇怪，但是在两年倒买倒卖的生涯中，我从来没想过我在犯罪。我真的不觉得这是一件坏事。这只是人们找到的东西罢了。反正白人有保险。只要能找到合适的理由，一切都顺理成章。在社会中，我们彼此伤害，是因为我们看不到受伤之人的样子。我们看不到他的表情。我们不觉得他们也是人。这也是为什么会出现街区的终极理由——把种族隔离出去的那群人赶得远远的，眼不见心不烦。因为如果白人有一瞬间把黑人当人看的话，就会发现奴隶制是如此不合理。在我们生活着的世界里，我们完全看不到自己做的事情会对他人造成什么影响，因为我们并不住在同一个地方。如果一个投资银行家和那个借了次级房贷的人住在一起的话，那投资银行家估计会不忍心从贷款人手里大肆捞钱。如果我们能够看到彼此的痛苦，彼此同情对方的处境的话，我们从一开始可能就不会去犯罪了。">查看中文翻译</div>

I felt too guilty, like it would be bad karma, which I know sounds stupid and it didn't get the family their camera back, but I just couldn't do it.

Hitler was going to compete with their best dancer, Hector, who was one of the best dancers in South Africa at the time. This invitation was a huge deal. We were going over there repping our hood. Alex and Soweto have always had a huge rivalry. Soweto was seen as the snobbish township and Alexandra was seen as the gritty and dirty township. Hector was from Diepkloof, which was the nice, well-off part of Soweto. Diepkloof was where the first million-rand houses were built after democracy. "Hey, we're not a township anymore. We're building nice things now." That was the attitude. That's who we were up against. Hitler practiced a whole week.</div>

Bongani and the other East Bank guys, because of where they were from, what they looked like -- they just had very little hope. You've got two options in that situation. You take the retail job, flip burgers at McDonald's, if you're one of the lucky few who even gets that much. The other option is to toughen up, put up this facade.
