<div class="line_en">My story begins about seven years ago, in 1875. My name is Jonathan Harker, and I live and work in London. My job is to buy and sell houses for other people. One day a letter arrived for me from a very rich man who lived in Transylvania. He wanted to buy a house in England and he needed my help. The man was Count Dracula, and I agreed to help him.</div>

<div class="line_en">I found a house for him, and he asked me to take all the papers for it to Transylvania. I was not very pleased about this. I was planning to get married in the autumn, and I did not want to leave my beautiful Mina.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我帮他找到了一幢房子，他让我带着所有跟这幢房子有关的文件去特兰西瓦尼亚。对此我很不乐意，因为我计划秋天结婚，我不想离开我美丽的明娜。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But you must go, Jonathan," she said. "The Count is rich, and perhaps he will give you more work later."</div>

<div class="line_en">So I agreed to go. I did not know then of the terrible danger which waited for me in Transylvania.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因此我就答应去了。那时，我并没有意识到一种可怕的危险正在特兰西瓦尼亚等着我。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And so, on 4th May I arrived at a little town called Bistritz. Transylvania was a strange and beautiful country. There were mountains, trees and rivers everywhere. And somewhere high in the mountains was the Count's home, Castle Dracula. I had six hours to wait before the coach came to take me there, so I went into a little hotel. Inside the hotel it was warm and friendly. The people there were all laughing and talking. "Where are you going?" they asked me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是5月4日，我到达了一个叫毕斯特里兹的小镇。特兰西瓦尼亚是个奇怪而美丽的国家。到处山峦起伏，树木葱郁，河流纵横。山中有一处高高耸立的地方就是伯爵的家，德拉库拉城堡。我必须等六个小时才能有马车来接我去那里，所以我就进了一家小旅馆。里面一派温暖祥和的气氛，那里的人们又说又笑，好不热闹。“你要去哪儿？”他们问我。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They began to talk again, but they were no longer laughing. Slowly, the hotel keeper's wife took the gold cross from her neck and put it into my hand. "Take this," she said. "There is danger at Castle Dracula. Perhaps this will help you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们又开始说话，但不再有人大笑了。旅店的老板娘慢慢地摘下脖子上的金十字架，把它放到我的手里。“拿着这个，”她说，“在德拉库拉城堡有危险，也许这个能对你有点儿帮助。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The coach travelled up into the mountains. Higher and higher it went, faster and faster. The sun was bright, but above the trees there was snow on the mountain tops. Then suddenly. the sun went down behind the mountains and everywhere was dark. In the forest around us, the wolves were howling. It was a terrible sound.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="马车径直朝山上驶去，越走越高，也越走越快。这里阳光明媚，但树木上方的山顶上却是白雪皑皑。然后突然太阳落山了，四周一片黑暗。周围的森林里，传来狼嚎的声音，非常可怕。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Suddenly the carriage stopped. I opened the door and got out. At once the carriage drove away and I was alone in front of the dark, silent castle. I stood there, looking up at it, and slowly, the big wooden door opened. A tall man stood in front of me. His hair was white and he was dressed in black from head to foot.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="车突然停了。我打开门下了车。马车立刻就离开了，我被独自留在这个漆黑死寂的城堡前。我站在那儿，抬头望着城堡，这时那扇巨大的木门慢慢打开了。一个身材高大的男人站在我的面前。他满头白发，却从头到脚一身黑衣。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Come in, Mr Harker," he said. "I am Count Dracula." He held out his hand and I took it. It was as cold as ice!</div>

<div class="line_en">I went into the castle and the Count carefully locked the door behind me. He put the key into his pocket and turned to go upstairs. I followed him, and we came to a room where a wood fire burned brightly. In front of it there was a little table with food and drink on it. The Count asked me to sit down and eat, but he did not eat with me. Later, we sat and talked by the fire. His English was very good, and while we talked, I had time to look at him carefully. His face was very white, his ears were like the ears of a cat, and his teeth were strong like the teeth of an animal. There was hair on his hands and his fingers were very long. When he touched me, I was afraid.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我一走进城堡，伯爵就在我身后小心地把门锁上了。他把钥匙放进口袋，转身上楼。我跟着他来到一间屋里，壁炉里一堆柴火烧得正旺。炉火前面的一张桌子上摆着食物和饮料。伯爵让我坐下来吃点儿东西，而他却不和我一块儿用餐。后来我们就坐在火边谈话。他英语说得非常好，我们说话时，我也有了时间仔细打量他。他脸色苍白，耳朵有点儿像猫，牙齿却如野兽般锋利。他的手毛茸茸的，手指非常长。他碰到我时，我有些害怕。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well," I began, "it's a very big house, old and dark, with a high wall all round it. There are trees everywhere. That's why the house is dark. It has a little church too." And I showed him some pictures of it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嗯，”我说，“那是幢又大又暗的老房子，四周有高墙。到处都是树木，这也正是房子暗的原因。院里还有一个小小的教堂。”我让他看了房子的一些照片。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Our business was now finished. The Count had all the papers for his new house, and there was nothing to keep me in Transylvania or in Castle Dracula, but the Count did not want me to leave. I was alone with him in the castle, but I never saw him in the daytime. I only saw him at night when he came and sat with me. We always talked until the morning and he asked me many questions about England. "I have plans to go there myself soon," he said. "Tell me about sending things to England by ship." So we talked about ships and the sea, and I thought about Mina, and her friend Lucy. Lucy and her mother were staying by the sea, and Mina was planning to visit them there some time. Stupidly, I told the Count about them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此时我们的生意已经谈完了。伯爵拿到了有关新房子的所有文件，我没什么理由继续留在特兰西瓦尼亚或德拉库拉城堡了，但伯爵并不想让我离开。只有我一个人和他待在城堡里，但我从未在白天见过他。只有晚上他过来和我聊天时，我才能见到他。我们总是谈到天亮，他问了我好多关于英国的问题。“我打算最近就去那儿。”他说，“告诉我如何用船把东西运往英国。”因此我们谈到了船和大海，我想到了明娜和她的朋友露西。露西正和她母亲住在海边，明娜也正打算去那儿拜访她们，和她们一起待上一段时间。我真愚蠢，居然把这些都告诉了伯爵。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was no mirror in my bedroom, but I had one with me, a present from Mina. One morning I was standing in front of it and I was shaving. Suddenly a hand touched me and a voice said, "Good morning." The Count was standing next to me. He was standing next to me, but I could not see him in the mirror!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我的卧室里没有镜子，但我带着一面小镜子，那是明娜送给我的。一天清晨，我正在镜子前刮胡子，突然一只手拍了拍我，有个声音说，“早上好。”伯爵站在我旁边。他就站在我旁边，但我在镜子里却看不见他！">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">My hand shook and I cut myself. Blood began to run down my face and I saw that Count Dracula was watching it hungrily. Suddenly he put out his hand. He had a wild look in his eyes, and I was afraid. But his hand touched the gold cross at my neck and his face changed. He took the mirror from me, went to the window, and a minute later the mirror was lying in a thousand pieces far below. He did not speak, but left the room quickly. And I stood there, and asked myself why I could not see this man in the mirror.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我手一哆嗦，脸就划破了。鲜血顺着我的脸颊淌了下来，我注意到伯爵贪婪地盯着我的血。突然他伸出手来，眼中露出狰狞的目光，我害怕极了。但他的手碰到了我脖子上的金十字架，脸色一下子就变了。他从我手里夺过那面镜子，走到窗前，把它扔了出去，镜子一下子便远远地摔到地上成了碎片。他什么也没有说，便迅速离开了屋子。我站在那儿心里嘀咕，我为什么 在镜子里看不到他。">查看中文翻译</div>
