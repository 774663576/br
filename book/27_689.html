<div class="line_en">Safeway's business was doing poorly. The supermarket chain had just announced a 6 percent drop in its profits for the last three months of 2011, a disappointing performance its longtime CEO Steve Burd was struggling to explain to the dozen analysts who had dialed in to the company's quarterly earnings call.</div>

<div class="line_en">One of them, Ed Kelly from the Swiss bank Credit Suisse, was gently needling Burd for using stock buybacks to mask the bad results. By reducing the number of shares it had outstanding, buybacks could artificially raise a company's earnings per share -- the headline number investors focused on -- even if its actual earnings fell. It was an old trick that astute Wall Street analysts versed in corporate sleights of hand saw right through.</div>

<div class="line_en">Piqued, Burd said he disagreed. He was confident that Safeway's fortunes were about to improve, which would make purchasing its own shares a smart investment. To justify his optimism, he cited three initiatives the company was pursuing. The first two were shrugged off as old news by his hard-to-please audience, but the analysts' ears pricked up when he got to the third.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大感不悦的博德表示不认同。他有信心喜互惠即将时来运转，届时就可证明现在买回自家股票是聪明的投资。为了证明自己的乐观其来有自，他枚举了喜互惠正在进行的三大计划：前两个计划在这群难以取悦的观众耳里听来了无新意，没人当一回事，直到他细数到第三个时，分析师们个个竖起耳朵。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"We're contemplating a significant… huh -- I'm just going to call it a wellness play," he said cryptically.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="「我们在慎重考虑一个重大…呃…现在只能透露那是个健康布局。」他语带神秘地说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Burd had high hopes for the venture. He'd ordered the remodeling of more than half of Safeway's seventeen hundred stores to make room for upscale clinics with deluxe carpeting, custom wood cabinetry, granite countertops, and flat-screen TVs. Per Theranos's instructions, they were to be called wellness centers and had to look "better than a spa." Although Safeway was shouldering the entire cost of the $350 million renovation on its own, Burd expected it to more than pay for itself once the new clinics started offering the startup's novel blood tests.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="博德对这项合作案寄予厚望。他下令改装喜互惠一千七百家门市中的半数，以便挪出空间增设高档门诊处，铺上豪华地毯、订做木工橱柜、装设花岗岩工作台、平面电视。在Theranos指示下，这些门诊处要称为健康中心，必须看起来「比spa中心更高级」。虽然三亿五千万美元的改装成本全由喜互惠独自承担，但根据博德预期，只要开始提供Theranos新颖的验血服务，成本就能回收。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was the first time Burd had made any public mention of this. He didn't elaborate, but the message the analysts took away was that the stodgy, ninety-seven-year-old grocery chain had a secret plan to jump-start its stagnating business. Inside Safeway, this secret plan was code-named "Project T-Rex." It referred to none other than the company's partnership with Theranos, which by now -- February 2012-- was two years in the making.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是博德第一次公开谈及此事，他并没有详细说明，但分析师接收到的消息是：这家高龄九十七、古板迟缓的杂货连锁有个秘密计划，企图重振停滞不前的业绩。在喜互惠内部，这项秘密计划的代号是「暴龙计划」，指的不是别的，正是与Theranos的合作，而这项合作到现在（二〇一二年二月）已经酝酿两年。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A few weeks after the earnings call, Burd and his executive team took a group of analysts on a tour of a Safeway store a few miles from his home in the scenic San Ramon Valley east of Oakland. The analysts were shown the store's new wellness center, but Burd remained evasive about what sort of service it was going to offer. Even the store's manager was in the dark. Theranos had insisted on absolute secrecy until the launch.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="法说会结束后几周，博德和高端主管带领一群分析师参观喜互惠一家门市，距离总公司数英里，位处奥克兰（Oakland）东边风景秀丽的圣拉蒙谷（San Ramon Valley）。分析师们参观了门市新设立的健康中心，但博德对于健康中心的服务仍然闪烁其词，就连门市经理也被蒙在鼓里。Theranos坚持正式推出前要绝对保密。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There had been quite a few delays since the companies had first agreed to do business together. At one point, Elizabeth told Burd that the earthquake that struck eastern Japan in March 2011 was interfering with Theranos's ability to produce the cartridges for its devices. Some Safeway executives found the excuse far-fetched, but Burd accepted it at face value. He was starry-eyed about the young Stanford dropout and her revolutionary technology, which fit so perfectly with his passion for preventive health care.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="自从两家公司同意合作以来，已有多次拖延纪录，伊莉莎白有一次甚至告诉博德，二〇一一年三月重创东日本的地震也妨碍到Theranos的生产能力，延误卡匣的生产。喜互惠有些高层觉得这个理由太牵强，但博德仍不疑有他，他把这位斯坦福辍学生以及她的革命性技术（这项技术正好跟他对预防医疗的热情不谋而合）想得太美好。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Elizabeth had a direct line to Burd and answered only to him. A war room had been set up in the Pleasanton headquarters where a small group of Safeway executives privy to Project T-Rex met once a week to discuss its progress. Burd attended all the meetings, either in person or via conference call if he was traveling. When questions or issues came up that had to be taken back to Theranos, he would pipe up with what became a refrain: "I'll talk to Elizabeth about it." Larree Renda, the executive who had started out at Safeway as a teenage bagger in 1974 and climbed the corporate ranks to become one of Burd's top deputies, and other executives involved in the project were surprised by how much latitude he gave the young woman. He usually held his deputies and the company's business partners to firm deadlines, but he allowed Elizabeth to miss one after the other. Some of Burd's colleagues knew he had two sons. They began to wonder if he saw in Elizabeth the daughter he'd never had. Whatever it was, he was in her thrall.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="伊莉莎白有直通博德的热线，也只回复他一人。喜互惠位于普莱森顿的总公司已成立「战情室」，一小撮知道暴龙计划的高端主管每周在此开会一次，讨论最新进度，博德每次开会必定到场，若人在外地就透过视频。每当有疑问或议题需要询问Theranos，博德就会大声说：「我再跟伊莉莎白谈谈。」萝莉．兰达（一九七四年进入喜互惠时才十几岁，从装袋人员做起，一路按部就班往上爬，如今已是博德的左右手之一）和其他参与计划的主管，都很惊讶于博德对这个年轻女子的宽容，他通常很要求副手和生意伙伴严守期限，但却容许伊莉莎白一次又一次延后。有些同事知道博德有两个儿子，他们开始怀疑他是不是把她当成女儿，不管是不是，他已经成了她的奴仆。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After all the delays, the partnership seemed to finally be getting off the ground in the early months of 2012: as a beta run before a full launch, the companies had agreed that Theranos would take over the blood testing at an employee health clinic Safeway had opened on its corporate campus in Pleasanton. The clinic was part of Burd's strategy to curb the supermarket operator's health-care costs by encouraging its workers to take better care of themselves. It offered free checkups. Employees who scored well on them were entitled to discounts on their health plan premiums. Conveniently located next to the gym on the Safeway campus, it was staffed with a doctor and three nurse practitioners and featured five exam rooms. It also had a little lab. A new sign in the reception area read, "Testing done by Theranos."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="经过多次延宕后，好不容易合作案终于要在二〇一二年头几个月启动：正式推出前先进行试营运，双方同意由Theranos接手员工健康诊所（喜互惠设立于普莱森顿总部的诊所）的验血工作。这个诊所是博德的策略之一，希望鼓励员工重视健康，以达到控制公司健保成本的目的。诊所提供了免费健康检查，检查结果良好的员工可获得健保费用折扣。诊所位于公司园区的健身房旁边，十分方便，人员编制有一位医生和三位护士，设有五间检查室，另外还有间小小的实验室，柜台有个新招牌写着：「Theranos血液检测」。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The employee clinic was part of Renda's portfolio. Among other responsibilities, she oversaw Safeway Health, the subsidiary Burd had created to sell the retailer's health benefits expertise to other companies. Renda's husband had lost his battle with lung cancer since Elizabeth had first showed up in Pleasanton two years before, but she hoped Theranos's painless finger-stick tests would spare others the torment he'd endured getting repeatedly stuck with needles in the last months of his life.</div>

<div class="line_en">Bradley had worked with a lot of sophisticated medical technologies in the army, so he was curious to see the Theranos system in action. However, he was surprised to learn that Theranos wasn't planning on putting any of its devices in the Pleasanton clinic. Instead, it had stationed two phlebotomists there to draw blood, and the samples they collected were couriered across San Francisco Bay to Palo Alto for testing. He also noticed that the phlebotomists were drawing blood from every employee twice, once with a lancet applied to the index finger and a second time the old-fashioned way with a hypodermic needle inserted in the arm. Why the need for venipunctures -- the medical term for needle draws -- if the Theranos finger-stick technology was fully developed and ready to be rolled out to consumers, he wondered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布莱德利在军队处理过很多复杂的医疗技术，所以十分好奇Theranos系统的运作，可是他很惊讶得知，Theranos竟不打算把它的设备放在普莱森顿的诊所内，反而派驻两个抽血人员到诊所抽血，再将采集的血液样本用快递送到旧金山对岸的帕罗奥图检测。他还注意到，每个员工必须抽血两次，一次是用刺血针扎食指取血，一次是用传统方式，用皮下注射针插入手臂抽血。为什么需要用静脉穿刺（venipunctures，用针抽血的医疗术语）？Theranos的扎指技术，不是已经成熟到可用于消费者身上了吗？他感到不解。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Bradley's suspicions were further aroused by the amount of time it took to get results back. His understanding had been that the tests were supposed to be quasi-instantaneous, but some Safeway employees were having to wait as long as two weeks to receive their results. And not every test was performed by Theranos itself. Even though the startup had never said anything about outsourcing some of the testing, Bradley discovered that it was farming out some tests to a big reference laboratory in Salt Lake City called ARUP.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="检测报告出炉所需的时间，更加深布莱德利的猜疑。根据他的了解，检测应该是几乎即时进行，但有些喜互惠同仁却得等上两周才能拿到报告。而且，不是所有检测都由Theranos运行。Theranos虽从未提过会把部分检测外包，但布莱德利却发现，它把部分检测外包给盐湖城（Salt Lake City）一家大型参考实验室ARUP。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">What really set off Bradley's alarm bells, though, was when some otherwise healthy employees started coming to him with concerns about abnormal test results. As a precaution, he sent them to get retested at a Quest or LabCorp location. Each time, the new set of tests came back normal, suggesting the Theranos results were off.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，真正令布莱德利心中警铃大作的，是开始有健康员工对检测报告的「异常」结果感到担忧而跑来找他。为了预防起见，他请他们到奎斯特或美国控股实验室公司（LabCorp）再检测一次，新的检测结果每次都是正常，这代表Theranos的检测结果不对。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then one day, a senior Safeway executive got his PSA result back. The acronym stands for "prostate-specific antigen," which is a protein produced by cells in the prostate gland. The higher the protein's concentration in a man's blood, the likelier he is to have prostate cancer. The senior Safeway executive's result was very elevated, indicating he almost certainly had prostate cancer. But Bradley was skeptical. As he had done with the other employees, he sent his worried colleague to get retested at another lab and, lo and behold, that result came back normal too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后某天，一位喜互惠资深高层拿到他的「摄护腺特异抗原」（PSA）报告，数值非常高，代表他几乎确定罹患摄护腺癌。PSA是摄护腺细胞制造的一种蛋白质，男性血液中如果这种蛋白质的浓度愈高，罹患摄护腺癌的可能性愈大。可是布莱德利很存疑，他照例请忧心忡忡的同事到另一家实验室重新检测，果不其然，检测结果也是正常的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The blood samples drawn from Safeway employees in Pleasanton were being couriered to a one-story building with a stone façade on East Meadow Circle in Palo Alto.

<div class="line_en">Bradley put together a detailed analysis of the discrepancies. Some of the differences between the Theranos values and the values from the other labs were disturbingly large. When the Theranos values did match those of the other labs, they tended to be for tests performed by ARUP.</div>

<div class="line_en">A few months earlier, the lab had obtained a certificate attesting that it was in compliance with CLIA, the federal law that governed clinical laboratories, but such certificates weren't difficult to obtain. Although the ultimate enforcer of CLIA was the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the federal agency delegated most routine lab inspections to states. In California, they were handled by the state department of health's Laboratory Field Services division, which an audit had shown to be badly underfunded and struggling to fulfill its oversight responsibilities.</div>

<div class="line_en">The main problem was the lab's dearth of experienced personnel. One of the CLSs, a fellow by the name of Kosal Lim, was so sloppy and poorly trained that one of his counterparts, Diana Dupuy, was convinced he was jeopardizing the accuracy of test results. Dupuy was from Houston and had trained at MD Anderson, the city's world-renowned cancer center. She'd spent most of her seven years since becoming a CLS as a blood-transfusion specialist, which had given her extensive exposure to CLIA regulations. She operated strictly by the book and didn't hesitate to report violations when she saw them.</div>

<div class="line_en">Had Steve Burd been allowed inside the East Meadow Circle lab, a network of rooms located in the center of the low-slung building, he would have noticed that it didn't contain a single Theranos proprietary device. That's because the miniLab was still under development and nowhere near ready for patient testing. What the lab did contain was more than a dozen commercial blood and body-fluid analyzers made by companies such as Chicago-based Abbott Laboratories, Germany's Siemens, and Italy's DiaSorin. The lab was run by an awkward pathologist named Arnold Gelb, who went by Arne (pronounced "Arnie"), and staffed with a handful of clinical laboratory scientists, or CLSs -- lab technicians who are certified by the state to handle human samples. Although it made use of only commercial instruments at this juncture, there were still plenty of things that could and did go wrong.</div>

<div class="line_en">To Dupuy, Lim's blunders were inexcusable. They included ignoring manufacturers' instructions for how to handle reagents; putting expired reagents in the same refrigerator as current ones; running patient tests on lab equipment that hadn't been calibrated; improperly performing quality-control runs on an analyzer; doing tasks he hadn't been trained to do; and contaminating a bottle of Wright's stain, a mixture of dyes used to differentiate blood cell types. Dupuy, who had a fiery streak, confronted Lim on several occasions, telling him at one point that she was going to become a laboratory inspector to root out bad lab technicians like him. When he proved unable to meet her standards, she began documenting his poor practices in regular emails she sent to Gelb and to Sunny, often attaching photos to prove her point.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在杜普伊看来，利姆犯的错误不可原谅，其中包括：无视制造商对试剂处理方式的指示、把过期试剂和现用试剂放在同一个冰箱、用尚未校准的实验室仪器为病患做检测、对分析仪的品质控管不当、运行他未受过训练的任务、污染一瓶赖德染料（Wright's stain，一种混合染剂，用于区别血球种类）。个性火爆的杜普伊常当面质疑利姆，甚至跟他说过她要去当实验室稽查员，杜绝他这种拙劣的实验室技术人员。直到种种事实证明他达不到她的标准后，她开始记录他不良的操作，固定用电邮寄给盖普和桑尼，通常会附上照片做为证据。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dupuy also had concerns about the competence of the two phlebotomists Theranos had stationed in Pleasanton. Blood is typically spun down in a centrifuge before it's tested to separate its plasma from the patient's blood cells. The phlebotomists hadn't been trained to use the centrifuge they'd been given and didn't know how long or at what speed to spin down patients' blood.

<div class="line_en">Shortly after making one of her complaints, Dupuy was sent to Delaware to train on a new Siemens analyzer Theranos had purchased. When she returned from her trip a week later, she noticed that the lab was spotless. Sunny, who appeared to have been waiting for her, summoned her into a meeting room. In an intimidating tone, he informed her that he had taken a tour of the lab in her absence and found not a single one of her complaints to be justified. He then brought up the fact that she had allowed her boyfriend into the building to help her carry out her luggage on the day she'd flown to Delaware. It was a serious breach of the company's security policy and he had decided to fire her for it, he said. After letting that sink in for a moment, he called Gelb in and asked him whether he valued Dupuy as a member of the lab and wanted to keep her on. Gelb said he did, at which point Sunny grudgingly reversed himself. Dupuy was still employed after all.</div>

<div class="line_en">Shaken, she went back to her desk in a daze. The next thing she knew, an employee from the IT department tapped her on the shoulder and asked her to step out into the hallway with him. He was trying to reestablish her company cell-phone connection and needed some information from her. Before changing his mind, Sunny had ordered it disconnected along with her company email and her access to the corporate network.</div>

<div class="line_en">Upset about the way she was treated, Dupuy fired off an email to Sunny that weekend insisting that she be allowed to retrieve her belongings, which in addition to lab books included a makeup bag containing her eyeglasses and her California CLS license.

<div class="line_en">By this point, some Safeway executives were getting angry. They were being denied their bonuses because the company was missing its financial targets, which had factored in the anticipated extra revenues and profits from the Theranos partnership. Matt O'Rell, an executive in Safeway's finance department, had been tasked with coming up with revenue projections for the wellness centers. Working from the aggressive assumption that each of them would attract an average of fifty patients per day, he had forecast $250 million in extra revenue per year. Not only had that revenue failed to materialize, Safeway had spent $100 million more than that just to build the centers.</div>

<div class="line_en">While they sat idle, the wellness centers occupied valuable real estate inside the stores that could have been put to other, profitable uses. Fed up with waiting, Renda and Bradley put together various ideas for how the space could be utilized. One of them was to staff the centers with nutritionists who would offer dietary advice. Another was to turn them into full-fledged medical clinics run by nurse practitioners. Yet another was to offer telemedicine services. They lobbied Burd to let them implement these plans but, after discussing the matter with Elizabeth, he turned them down. She didn't want to surrender the space, he said.</div>

<div class="line_en">Shortly after the stock market closed on January 2, 2013, Safeway put out a press release announcing that Burd would retire the following May after the company's annual shareholder meeting. The news was presented as a voluntary decision, but Renda and other executives suspected that the board had asked him to step down. Even on his way out, Burd remained upbeat about the prospects for the still-secret Theranos partnership. Among a list of his achievements as CEO, the press release quoted him as saying that Safeway would soon "be rolling out a wellness initiative that has the potential to transform the Company."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="二〇一三年一月二日股市收盘后不久，喜互惠发出新闻稿，宣布博德将在五月年度股东会后退休，对外说词是他主动提出的决定，但兰达和其他高层都猜想是董事会要求他下台。即使人都要走了，博德对至今仍未公开的Theranos合作案还是乐观以对。新闻稿上洋洋洒洒列出他在首席执行官任内的成就，其中还引述他的话：喜互惠很快就会「推出一项健康计划，公司有可能从此改头换面」。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Behind the scenes, Safeway's board of directors was losing patience. After twenty years in the job, it was clear that Burd had lost the confidence of Wall Street. His first decade as CEO had been a big success and featured a sharp rise in Safeway's stock price. But in recent years, his passion for health and wellness had made him lose sight of what remained at the heart of the company: the unglamorous business of selling groceries. The large investment made in the wellness centers and the endless delays in bringing it to fruition were the last straw.</div>

<div class="line_en">After Burd's departure, the communication channel to Elizabeth was lost. Anyone from Safeway who wanted to talk to Theranos had to go through Sunny or the Frat Pack. Sunny acted put-off whenever Safeway executives asked for status updates, as if his time was too precious to waste and they had no idea what it took to produce an innovation of this magnitude. His arrogance was infuriating. And yet Safeway was still hesitant to walk away from the partnership. What if the Theranos technology did turn out to be game-changing? It might spend the next decade regretting passing up on it. The fear of missing out was a powerful deterrent.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="博德离开后，跟伊莉莎白沟通的管道就断了，想跟Theranos联系就得透过桑尼或兄弟帮。每次喜互惠高层问到最新进度，桑尼总是一再推迟，仿佛他的时间很宝贵、浪费不得，不然就是一副他们不懂这种规模的创新很花时间的态度。他的傲慢令人火大，但喜互惠仍迟迟不敢弃守这项合作。要是Theranos的技术真的能颠覆市场呢？那喜互惠接下来十年可能就得在懊悔中度过。害怕错失机会，是一种威力强大的吓阻力量。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As for Burd, it was clear he hadn't been ready to retire. Just three months after leaving the supermarket chain, he founded a consulting firm to advise companies on how to reduce their health-care costs. He called it Burd Health.
