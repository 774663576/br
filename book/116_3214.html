<div class="line_en">Mrs Rawdon Crawley knew that to gain acceptance into the highest society, she must be presented to the King at court. After she had made her curtsy to the highest person in the land, the noble families of England would be obliged, however unwillingly, to recognize her.</div>

<div class="line_en">Her sister-in-law, Lady Jane, being from a noble family, was the ideal person to present Becky at court, so Becky made herself very agreeable to Sir Pitt when he was in London. She helped him write his political speeches, and discussed political events with him. She introduced him to important gentlemen at her parties, and he was deeply impressed by Becky's friendly relationship with the wealthy Lord Steyne. He had no idea that behind his back Becky made fun of him to the great Lord.</div>

<div class="line_en">And later, sitting by the fire, Becky let him talk, listening to him with kindly interest and sewing a shirt for her dear little son.

<div class="line_en">When the house in Great Gaunt Street was ready and Lady Jane had moved in, Becky would call on her from time to time, but in general the two women saw little of each other.

<div class="line_en">"You could be the wife of a king, with all your skills," Sir Pitt said. He thought to himself how Rawdon was a foolish, dull fellow, who didn't appreciate his brilliant wife; and how pretty Becky looked, sitting opposite him at the table.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“以你现在的能力，你都可以做国王的妻子了。”皮特爵士说。他心想，罗顿是个多么愚蠢、迟钝的家伙，不懂欣赏自己优秀的妻子。而且，坐在桌子对面的贝姬看上去多漂亮啊。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In the middle of these fine parties and brilliant people, Colonel Rawdon found himself more isolated every day. He was rarely required for social duties these days, and would often walk round to Gaunt Street with young Rawdy, and sit with Lady Jane and the children. He was glad to be given small jobs to do -- taking messages, helping with the children's dinner. The brave and daring young soldier of ten years before had become a dull, lazy, obedient, middle-aged gentleman.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在这些讲究的聚会上，罗顿上校身处一群杰出人士之中，觉得自己日渐孤立。这些日子以来，他很少被要求参加社交应酬，因此就常和小罗迪一起走到大冈特街，陪简女士及孩子们坐坐。他很乐意被指派点小事做，比如传个信，帮忙给孩子们做饭等等。十年前那个勇武的年轻军人已经变成了一个沉闷、懒惰又恭顺的中年绅士。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Do let Georgy spend the day with me next Saturday," she said to Amelia one day. "Miss Osborne is coming to visit, and I know she'd love to see her brother's son. And who knows, perhaps the boy's grandfather will do something for him one day."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“请务必让乔基下周六和我玩一天吧。”一天，她对阿梅莉亚说，“奥斯本小姐要来拜访，我知道她很想见见她的侄子。而且，谁知道呢，没准儿孩子的祖父将来会为他做点什么。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was a long friendship between the Dobbin and Osborne families. The younger Osborne sister was now married, but the elder, Miss Jane Osborne, still lived at home with her father, old Mr Osborne, whose violent temper and black moods had grown worse year by year since his son's death at Waterloo. Miss Osborne led a sad, gloomy life, and was always asking her friend Miss Dobbin for news of her young nephew.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="多宾和奥斯本两家交情不浅。奥斯本家两姐妹中的妹妹现已出嫁，但是姐姐简·奥斯本小姐仍和父亲住在一起。自从儿子在滑铁卢战死，老奥斯本先生的暴脾气和坏情绪也一年胜过一年。奥斯本小姐过着愁苦、抑郁的生活，一直向她的朋友多宾小姐问起小侄子的情况。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Miss Dobbin followed Georgy's progress with interest, and was keen to be helpful, well aware how poor the Sedleys were.</div>

<div class="line_en">Georgy was now a schoolboy, though it had given Amelia great pain to release him from her care, to mix with rough boys and to be scolded by stern schoolteachers. It was a little local school (run by a friend of Amelia's constant admirer, Mr Linton), and Georgy loved it, doing well at all his lessons and coming home in the evenings with boastful stories of this and that -- all of which were believed by his fond mother.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="乔基已经到了上学的年纪，虽然阿梅莉亚舍不得儿子离开自己身边，但还是让他去上学了。乔基现在和粗野的男孩子们待在一起，还要受到严厉教师的责骂，这都让她非常心痛。那是一所地方小学校（由阿梅莉亚的忠实仰慕者林顿先生的一位朋友经营），乔基喜欢学校，他门门功课都不错，每晚回家都吹嘘自己这样那样的事迹，深爱着他的母亲对这些故事深信不疑。">查看中文翻译</div>

He will also give Mrs Amelia Osborne a regular allowance, to enable her and her family to live in comfort. If she marries again, as is said to be likely, this allowance will still continue. In return, the boy will live with Mr Osborne, who will permit him to visit his mother occasionally in her own home."</div>
