<div class="line_en">The way was long and hard. The interior of Svalbard was mountainous, with jumbled peaks and sharp ridges deeply cut by ravines and steep-sided valleys, and the cold was intense. Lyra thought back to the smooth-running sledges of the gyp-tians on the way to Bolvangar; how swift and comfortable that progress now seemed to have been! The air here was more penetratingly chill than any she had experienced before; or it might have been that the bear she was riding wasn't as lightfooted as lorek; or it might have been that she was tired to her very soul. At all events, it was desperately hard going.</div>

<div class="line_en">At first, he'd said, the Svalbard bears regarded Lord Asriel as being no different from any of the other politicians, kings, or troublemakers who had been exiled to their bleak island. The prisoners were important, or they would have been killed outright by their own people; they might be valuable to the bears one day, if their political fortunes changed and they returned to rule in their own countries; so it might pay the bears not to treat them with cruelty or disrespect.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他说，起初，斯瓦尔巴特群岛上的披甲熊认为，阿斯里尔勋爵跟流放到他们这个寒冷的岛上的其他政客、国王或闹事者没什么两样。囚犯们都是要人，否则早就会被他们自己人毫不犹豫地给杀了；有朝一日他们也许会成为披甲熊的无价之宝——如果他们的政治命运发生变化，回国重新当上统治者的话；因此，对待他们不残酷、不失礼，也许会对披甲熊有好处。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Besides, the bears had never met anything quite like Lord Asriel's own haughty and imperious nature. He dominated even lofur Raknison, arguing forcefully and eloquently, and persuaded the bear-king to let him choose his own dwelling place.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="另外，披甲熊们从来没有见过像阿斯里尔勋爵这样傲慢、专横的人。他甚至还影响了埃欧弗尔·拉克尼松，跟他激烈地雄辩，说服了熊国王让他自己选择栖身之地。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So Lord Asriel had found conditions on Svalbard no better and no worse than hundreds of other exiles had done. But certain things had made his jailers more wary of him than of other prisoners they'd had. There was the air of mystery and spiritual peril surrounding anything that had to do with Dust; there was the clear panic on the part of those who'd brought him there; and there were Mrs. Coulter's private communications with lofur Raknison.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所以，阿斯里尔勋爵觉得，跟其他无数的流放地相比，斯瓦尔巴特群岛的条件既不好也不坏，但是，某些事情却令他的看守对他比对别的囚犯保持了更高的警惕。任何跟尘埃有关的事情都弥漫着一股神秘的气氛，一种精神上的危险；把他带到斯瓦尔巴特群岛的人中间流露出明显的慌乱，库尔特夫人还跟埃欧弗尔·拉克尼松进行了秘密通信。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">With furious concentration he sent for books, instruments, chemicals, all manner of tools and equipment. And somehow it had come, from this source or that; some openly, some smuggled in by the visitors he insisted he was entitled to have. By land, sea, and air, Lord Asriel assembled his materials, and within six months of his committal, he had all the equipment he wanted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他极其执著地派人给他弄来书籍、仪器、化学制品、五花八门的工具和设备。最后，这些东西总算是从各种地方弄到了：有的是公开运来的，有的是由他坚持要见的来客偷偷带进来的。阿斯里尔勋爵通过陆海空各种途径收集他所需要的材料，被关押六个月后，他便把自己想要的所有设备都弄到手了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The first one he was allotted was too low down, he said. He needed a high spot, above the smoke and stir of the fire mines and the smithies. He gave the bears a design of the accommodation he wanted, and told them where it should be; and he bribed them with gold, and he flattered and bullied lofur Raknison, and with a bemused willingness the bears set to work. Before long a house had arisen on a headland facing north: a wide and solid place with fireplaces that burned great blocks of coal mined and hauled by bears, and with large windows of real glass. There he dwelt, a prisoner acting like a king.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他说，分给他住的第一个地方地势太低，他需要的是一块高地，在火矿、铁匠铺的浓烟和喧嚣的上面。他把自己想要的住所的设计图提供给披甲熊，告诉他们应该建在什么地方。他用金子贿赂他们，对埃欧弗尔·拉克尼松时而奉承，时而恐吓。披甲熊被弄得晕晕乎乎的，心甘情愿地开始给他建造住所。不久，在面向北方的一个海岬上，一座房子拔地而起了：宽敞、结实，还建有壁炉，里面烧着披甲熊开采并运来的巨大煤块，宽大的窗户上镶着真正的玻璃。他就在那儿住了下来，虽是囚犯，但俨然一个国王。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The windows from which the light emerged also showed Lord Asriel's formidable power. Glass was expensive, and large sheets of it were prodigal of heat in these fierce latitudes; so to see them here was evidence of wealth and influence far greater than lofur Raknison's vulgar palace.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="透出灯光来的窗户本身也说明阿斯里尔勋爵威力无边。玻璃本身就已经非常昂贵了，而在如此高的纬度上，这么大的玻璃窗非常浪费热量；因此，在这样的地方见到这样的玻璃窗，这就足以说明这里的财富和势力比埃欧弗尔·拉克尼松那座俗不可耐的宫殿要大多了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A wide broken slope of tumbled rocks and ice, where a track had been laboriously cleared, led up to a crag outlined against the sky. There was no Aurora, but the stars were brilliant. The crag stood black and gaunt, but at its summit was a spacious building from which light spilled lavishly in all directions: not the smoky inconstant gleam of blubber lamps, nor the harsh white of anbaric spotlights, but the warm creamy glow of naphtha.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="宽阔、崎岖的山坡上，到处是东倒西歪的岩石和冰块，上面有一条费了九牛二虎之力才修好的小道，往上通往一处耸入高空的峭壁。天上没有极光，但星星非常明亮。那道黑乎乎的峭壁凄凉地矗立着，但峭壁的顶上却是一座宽大的房子，灯光从里面向四面八方尽情地倾泻着：不是烟雾缭绕、忽明忽暗的鲸脂油灯光，也不是白得耀眼的电聚光灯，而是温馨、米色的石脑油灯。">查看中文翻译</div>

Well, this new kind of particle was elementary all right, but it was very hard to measure because it didn't react in any of the usual ways. The hardest thing for Rusakov to understand was why the new particle seemed to cluster where human beings were, as if it were attracted to us. And especially to adults. Children too, but not nearly so much until their daemons have taken a fixed form. During the years of puberty they begin to attract Dust more strongly, and it settles on them as it settles on adults.</div>

It means removing the sexual organs of a boy so that he never develops the characteristics of a man.

Many just became fat spoiled half-men. Some died from the effects of the operation. But the Church wouldn't flinch at the idea of a little cut, you see. There was a precedent.
