<div class="line_en">There were, however, plenty of things to attend to before they could set off. In a village like this, many items necessary for their journey -- blankets, water flasks, tinder -- were communally owned and securing their use required much bargaining with neighbours. Moreover, Axl and Beatrice, advanced though they were in years, had their burden of daily duties and could not simply go away without the consent of the community. And even when they were finally ready to leave, a turn in the weather delayed them further. For what was the point of risking the hazards of fog, rain and cold when sunshine was surely just around the corner?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，出发之前，他们还有不少事情要处理。在这样的村子里，旅行必备的很多东西——毯子、水壶、火绒——都是公共财物，要和邻居们商量好了才能使用。而且，埃克索与比特丽丝虽然上了年纪，也有每天的工作份额，不能未经大家同意就直接出门。等他们终于做好了出门的准备，天气变了，又耽搁了下来。既然晴朗的日子肯定马上就要来到，为什么还要在雾、雨和严寒中冒险呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But they did eventually set off, with walking sticks and bundles on their backs, on a bright morning of wispy white clouds and a strong breeze. Axl had wished to start at first light -- it was clear to him the day would be fine -- but Beatrice had insisted on waiting till the sun was higher. The Saxon village where they would shelter the first night, she argued, was easily within a day's walk, and surely their priority was to cross the corner of the Great Plain as close to noon as possible, when the dark forces of that place were most likely to be dormant.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，他们最后还是动身了，拿着手杖、背着行囊。那是个晴朗的早晨，天上飘着淡淡的白云，风很大。埃克索本来希望天一亮就出发——他知道天气不会差——但比特丽丝坚持要等到太阳再高一点。她说，第一天，他们要在那个撒克逊村庄过夜，一天走到那儿很容易，他们的首要任务是，尽可能在中午的时候穿过大平原的一角，那儿的黑暗力量那时候很可能在睡觉。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In the days before their journey's start, Beatrice had grown increasingly confident of remembering their route, at least as far as the Saxon village which she had regularly visited with the other women over the years. But once they lost sight of the craggy hills above their settlement, and had crossed the valley beyond the marshland, she became less certain. At a fork in a path, or facing a windswept field, she would pause and stand for a long time, panic creeping into her gaze as she surveyed the land.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="出发前的那些日子里，比特丽丝越来越自信，相信自己能够回忆起路线，至少到撒克逊村庄的路没问题，多年来她经常和其他女人一起到那儿去。可是，等到巢穴上那嶙峋的山峦从视野中消失，他们穿过了沼泽尽头的山谷，她开始有点疑惑了。在分岔路口，或者面对一片大风呼啸的田地，她就要停下来，站很长时间，打量着前方的土地，眼神中不免有些恐慌。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It had been a while since they had walked any distance together, and Axl had been anxious about his wife's stamina. But after an hour he found himself reassured: though her pace was slow -- he noticed again something lop-sided about her gait, as if she were cushioning some pain -- Beatrice kept moving on steadily, head down into the wind in open land, undaunted when confronted by thistles and undergrowth. On uphills, or ground so muddy it was an effort to pull one foot out after the other, she would slow right down, but keep pushing on.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们有一段时间没有一起走远路了，埃克索有点担心妻子的体力。一个小时之后，他放心了：比特丽丝步伐慢——他又一次注意到，她走路的时候身体有点倾斜，好像什么地方疼似的——但她一直向前走，脸迎着开阔地上的风，遇到蓟丛矮树也不畏惧。上坡的时候，或者遇到泥地，脚陷下去要花大力气才能拔出来，她马上就会慢下来，但仍然坚持往前走。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I might point out here that navigation in open country was something much more difficult in those days, and not just because of the lack of reliable compasses and maps. We did not yet have the hedgerows that so pleasantly divide the countryside today into field, lane and meadow. A traveller of that time would, often as not, find himself in featureless landscape, the view almost identical whichever way he turned. A row of standing stones on the far horizon, a turn of a stream, the particular rise and fall of a valley: such clues were the only means of charting a course. And the consequences of a wrong turn could often prove fatal. Never mind the possibilities of perishing in bad weather: straying off course meant exposing oneself more than ever to the risk of assailants -- human, animal or supernatural -- lurking away from the established roads.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我在这儿不妨说一下，那时候在开阔地上找路，比现在要难得多，不仅仅是因为缺乏可靠的罗盘和地图。今天，我们有篱笆，将乡村方便地划分成田地、道路和草场，可那时候没有篱笆，旅行者看到的自然景观往往没什么特别之处，往哪儿走都是一样的。远处地平线上矗立的一排大石头，小溪的某处弯道，山谷的起伏形状——只能靠这些线索才能找到路。而且一旦走错路，往往有致命的后果。更不要说在恶劣天气中丢掉性命了：走上歧路，意味着遭受攻击的巨大危险——人、兽、鬼——躲在远离大路的阴暗之中。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">You might have been surprised by how little they conversed as they walked, this couple usually so full of things to tell each other. But at a time when a broken ankle or an infected graze could be lifethreatening, there was a recognition that concentration was desirable at each and every step. You might also have noted that whenever the path grew too narrow to walk side by side, it was always Beatrice, not Axl, who went in front. This too might surprise you, it seeming more natural for the man to go first into potentially hazardous terrain, and sure enough, in woodland or where there was the possibility of wolves or bears, they would switch positions without discussion. But for the most part, Axl would make sure his wife went first, for the reason that practically every fiend or evil spirit they were likely to encounter was known to target its prey at the rear of a party -- in much the way, I suppose, a big cat will stalk an antelope at the back of the herd. There were numerous instances of a traveller glancing back to the companion walking behind, only to find the latter vanished without trace. It was the fear of such an occurrence that compelled Beatrice intermittently to ask as they walked: "Are you still there, Axl?" To which he would answer routinely: "Still here, princess."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="你可能会惊讶于一件事：这对老夫妇平时有那么多话要说，走路的时候却很少交谈。在那个时候，摔伤脚踝、破皮感染，都可能威胁到生命，所以大家都知道，走路的时候必须小心翼翼、全神贯注。你可能也会注意到，遇到窄路两人不能并肩而行，走在前面的总是比特丽丝，不是埃克索。你也许会感到惊讶，因为遇到可能有危险的领域，男人先走似乎是很自然的事情——当然，遇到林地或者可能有狼或熊的地方，他们会默默地交换位置。但是，大多时候，埃克索总是让妻子走在前面，原因是，他们可能遇到的每一个凶魔恶鬼，据说都是从队伍的尾部发起攻击的——我想，类似于老虎跟踪羚羊群后部的某只羊。这样的例子很多：一位旅行者回头去看走在后面的同伴，却发现人已经消失了，毫无踪迹。比特丽丝担心发生这样的事，所以不时要问一声：“你还在吗，埃克索？”他总是答道：“在这儿呢，公主。”">查看中文翻译</div>

Axl, are you listening to me? It's when the path goes over where the giant is buried. To one who doesn't know it, it's an ordinary hill, but I'll signal to you and when you see me you're to follow off the path and round the edge of the hill till we meet the same path on its way down.

<div class="line_en">As Beatrice had promised, they were required to walk on the Great Plain for only a short distance. Their path, though muddy at times, remained defined and never took them out of sunlight. After an initial descent it climbed steadily, till they found themselves walking along a high ridge, moorland on either side of them. The wind was fierce, but if anything a welcome antidote to the noon sun. The ground everywhere was covered in heather and gorse, never more than knee high, and only occasionally did a tree come into view -- some solitary, crone-like specimen, bowed by endless gales. Then a valley appeared to their right, reminding them of the power and mystery of the Great Plain, and that they were now trespassing on but a small corner of it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="正如比特丽丝所说，他们在大平原上只要走一小段路。他们走的那条路有时有些泥泞，但路一直看得到，而且总有阳光。一开始是下坡，随后慢慢攀升，最后来到一条高高的山梁上，两边都是沼地。正午烈日当头，所以风虽然猛烈，倒也能消解酷热。地上到处长满了石楠和荆豆，都高不过膝盖，偶尔会看到一棵树——孤零零、干巴巴的样子，被无尽的大风压弯了身体。然后他们右边出现了一道山谷，让他们想起大平原的力量和神秘，提醒他们现在走的只是其中一个小小的角落。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They walked close together, Axl almost at his wife's heels. Even so, throughout the crossing, Beatrice continued every five or six steps to chant, in the manner of a litany, the question: "Are you still there, Axl?" to which he would respond: "Still here, princess." Aside from this ritualistic exchange, they said nothing. Even when they reached the giant's burial mound, and Beatrice made urgent signs for them to move from the path into the heather, they kept up this call and response in level tones, as though wishing to deceive any listening demons about their intentions. All the while Axl watched for fast-moving mist or sudden darkenings in the sky, but there came no hint of either, and then they had put the Great Plain behind them. As they climbed through a small wood full of songbirds, Beatrice made no comment, but he could see her whole posture relax, and her refrain came to an end.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两人走路时相距很近，埃克索几乎紧贴着妻子的脚后跟。尽管如此，穿越大平原的过程中，比特丽丝每走五六步就要问一遍，就像连续祷告一样：“你还在吗，埃克索？”他就回答：“还在呢，公主。”除了这种仪式性的问答之外，两人都不说话。到达埋葬巨人的山丘时，比特丽丝打了个紧急的手势，两人离开道路，走进石楠地里，仍旧语调平稳地一问一答，好像是要骗过偷听的魔鬼似的。埃克索一直留意着，看看有没有快速飘过的迷雾，或者天上会不会突然暗下来，但都没有，于是两人经过了大平原。上坡时，两人经过一片鸟儿欢唱的小树林，比特丽丝没说话，但他能看出来，她的体态放松了，两人的一问一答也结束了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They rested beside a brook, where they bathed their feet, ate bread and refilled their flasks. From this point their route followed a long sunken lane from Roman days, lined by oaks and elms, which was much easier walking, but required vigilance on account of the other wayfarers they were bound to meet. And sure enough, during the first hour, they encountered coming the other way a woman with her two children, a boy driving donkeys, and a pair of travelling players hurrying to rejoin their troupe. On each occasion they stopped to exchange pleasantries, but another time, hearing the clatter of approaching wheels and hooves, they hid themselves in the ditch. This too proved harmless -- a Saxon farmer with a horse and cart piled high with firewood.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们在一条小溪边休息，在溪里洗了脚，吃了面包，拿水壶装满水。从这儿开始，他们要走一条长长的、沉陷下去的大道，是罗马时代留下来的，两边有榆树和橡树，走起来容易得多，但要保持警觉，因为他们肯定会遇到其他的行路人。果然，头一个小时里，他们就遇到了对面走来的路人——一个女人带着两个孩子；一个赶驴的男孩；两名演戏的，急匆匆要赶上自己的戏班。每次他们都停下脚步，互相问好，不过有一次，他们听到车轮和马蹄的声音，跑到路旁的沟里躲了起来，后来发现其实也没有危险——赶马车的是个撒克逊农夫，车上堆了高高的柴火。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But Beatrice was on her feet, leaning forward, a hand raised to shield her eyes. "I can see the road ahead curving into the distance, Axl.

<div class="line_en">The ruined villa was further from the road than Beatrice remembered. With the first drops of rain and the sky darkening above them, they found themselves struggling down a long narrow path waist high with nettles through which they had to beat their way with their sticks.

<div class="line_en">Still there was silence and they went in under the arch into the shade of what must once have been a corridor. They emerged into the grey light of a spacious room, though here too, an entire wall had fallen away. The adjoining room had disappeared altogether, and evergreens were pressing in oppressively right up to the edge of the floor. The three standing walls, however, provided a sheltered area, with a good ceiling. Here, against the grimy masonry of what once had been whitewashed walls, were two dark figures, one standing, the other sitting, some distance apart.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="仍然没人回答，于是他们穿过拱门，走过一段阴暗的过道，以前这儿应该是个走廊。两人步入一片灰色的亮光中，来到一个宽敞的房间，有一堵墙全塌了。隔壁的房间整个儿消失了，杂树乱草密密匝匝，径直漫到了房间地板的边缘。但是，三堵矗立的墙围起了一块遮风挡雨的地方，屋顶没有破损。曾经雪白的墙壁，如今肮脏不堪。靠墙有两个暗黑的人影，一坐一站，相距较远。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The villa must have been splendid enough in Roman days, but now only a small section was standing. Once magnificent floors lay exposed to the elements, disfigured by stagnant puddles, weeds and grass sprouting through the faded tiles. The remains of walls, in places barely ankle high, revealed the old layout of the rooms. A stone arch led into the surviving part of the building, and Axl and Beatrice now moved cautiously towards it, pausing at the threshold to listen. Eventually Axl called out: "Is anyone within?" And when there was no reply: "We're two elderly Britons seeking shelter from the storm. We come in peace."</div>

<div class="line_en">Seated on a piece of fallen masonry was a small, bird-like old woman -- older than Axl and Beatrice -- in a dark cloak, the hood pushed back enough to reveal her leathery features. Her eyes were sunk deep so that you could hardly see them. The curve of her back was not quite touching the wall behind her. Something stirred on her lap and Axl saw it was a rabbit, held tightly in her bony hands.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一块跌落下来的砖头上，坐着一个身形瘦小的女人，像只鸟一样，显然上了年纪——比埃克索和比特丽丝还老——披着黑色斗篷，兜帽推到脑后，现出一张苍老的面孔。她双目深陷，几乎看不到；背部并没有完全靠在身后的墙上。她怀里有什么东西在动，埃克索看到那是只兔子，被一双瘦骨嶙峋的手紧紧抓着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At the furthest point along the same wall, as though he had moved as far from the old woman as possible while keeping under cover, was a thin, unusually tall man. He wore a thick long coat of the sort a shepherd might wear during a cold night's watch, but where it ended, the exposed lower parts of his legs were bare. On his feet were the kind of shoes Axl had seen on fishermen. Though he was probably still young, the top of his head was smoothly bald, while dark tufts sprouted around his ears. The man was standing rigidly, his back to the room, one hand on the wall before him as though listening intently to something occurring on the other side. He glanced over his shoulder as Axl and Beatrice came in, but said nothing. The old woman too was staring at them in silence and only when Axl said: "Peace be with you," did they unfreeze a little. The tall man said: "Come in further, friends, or you will not stay dry."</div>

<div class="line_en">Axl and Beatrice did as suggested, and then there was silence for a few further moments while the rain continued to beat down. Eventually a movement from the old woman made Axl glance towards her. She was pulling back the rabbit's ears, and as the animal struggled to free itself, her claw-like hand kept it firmly in its grasp. Then, as Axl watched, the old woman produced in her other hand a large rusted knife and placed it against the creature's throat. As Beatrice beside him started, Axl realised that the dark patches beneath their feet, and elsewhere all over the ruined floor, were old bloodstains, and that mingled with the smell of ivy and damp mouldering stone was another faint but lingering one of slaughter.</div>

<div class="line_en">At last the tall man turned to face them. "Friends," he said, "I was surprised to see you enter earlier, but now I'm glad. For I see you're good people, and I beg you, while you wait for this storm to pass, listen to my plight. I'm a humble boatman who ferries travellers across choppy waters. I don't mind the work though the hours are long and when there are many waiting to cross there's little sleep and my limbs ache with each thrust of the oar. I work through rain and wind and under the parching sun. But I keep my spirits up looking forward to my rest days. For I'm but one of several boatmen and we're each able to take our turn to rest, if only after long weeks of labour. On our rest days, we each have a special place to go, and this, friends, is mine. This house where I was once a carefree child. It's not as it once was, but for me it's filled with precious memories, and I come here asking only the quiet to enjoy them. Now consider this. Whenever I come here, within an hour of my arrival, this old woman will enter through that arch. She'll sit herself down and taunt me hour by hour, night and day. She'll make cruel and unjust accusations. Under cover of dark, she'll curse me with the most horrible curses. She will not give me a moment's respite. Sometimes, as you see, she'll bring with her a rabbit, or some such small creature, so she can slay it and pollute this precious place with its blood. I've done all I can to persuade her to leave me, but what pity God placed in her soul, she has learnt to ignore. She will not go, nor will she cease to taunt. Even now it's only your unexpected entrance that has caused her to pause in her persecution. And before long it will be time to begin my journey back, to more long weeks of toil on the water. Friends, I beg you, do what you can to make her leave. Persuade her that her behaviour is ungodly. You may have influence on her, being as you are from the outside."</div>

<div class="line_en">"You couldn't have spoken more aptly, sir," the old woman said. "Do I think this a charming way to spend my fading days? I'd rather be far from here, in the company of my own husband, and it's because of this boatman I'm now parted from him. My husband was a wise and careful man, sir, and we planned our journey for a long time, talked of it and dreamt of it over many years. And when finally we were ready, and had all we needed, we set off on the road and after several days found the cove from where we could cross to the island. We waited for the ferryman, and in time, saw his boat coming towards us. But as luck would have it, it was this very man here who came to us. See how tall he is. Standing on his boat on the water, against the sky with his long oar, he looked as tall and thin as those players do when they hobble on their stilts. He came to where my husband and I were standing on the rocks and tied his boat. And to this day I don't know how he did it, but somehow he tricked us. We were too trusting. With the island so near, this boatman took away my husband and left me waiting on the shore, after forty years and more of our being husband and wife and hardly a day apart. I can't think how he did it. His voice must have put us in a dream, because before I knew it he was rowing off with my husband and I was still on land. Even then, I didn't believe it. For who could suspect such cruelty from a boatman? So I waited. I said to myself, it's simply that the boat cannot take more than one passenger at a time, for the water was unsettled that day, and the sky almost as dark as it is now. I stood there on the rock and watched the boat getting smaller and then a speck. And still I waited, and in time the speck grew larger and it was the boatman coming back to me. I could soon see his head as smooth as a pebble, now with no passenger left in his boat. And I imagined it was my turn and I would soon be with my beloved again. But when he came to where I was waiting, and tied his rope to the pole, he shook his head and refused to take me across. I argued and wept and called to him, but he would not listen. Instead he offered me -- such cruelty!-- he offered a rabbit he said had been caught in a trap on the island's shore. He'd brought it to me thinking it a fitting supper for my first evening of solitude. Then seeing there was no one else waiting to be ferried, he pushed away, leaving me weeping on the shore, holding his wretched rabbit. I let it run off into the heather a moment later, for I tell you I had little appetite that evening or for many evenings after. That's why it is I bring him my own little gift each time I come here. A rabbit for his stew in return for his kindness that day."</div>

We boatmen have ferried many there over the years, and by now there will be hundreds inhabiting its fields and woods.

Occasionally on a moonlit night or when a storm's ready to break, he may sense the presence of his fellow inhabitants. But most days, for each traveller, it's as though he's the island's only resident. I'd happily have ferried this woman, but when she understood she wouldn't be with her husband, she declared she didn't care for such solitude and refused to go.

<div class="line_en">"There's truth in just one part of what she says," the boatman said. "Occasionally a couple may be permitted to cross to the island together, but this is rare. It requires an unusually strong bond of love between them. It does sometimes occur, I don't deny, and that's why when we find a man and wife, or even unmarried lovers, waiting to be carried over, it's our duty to question them carefully. For it falls to us to perceive if their bond is strong enough to cross together. This lady is reluctant to accept it, but her bond with her husband was simply too weak. Let her look into her heart, then dare say my judgement that day was in error."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“她说的话，只有一部分是真的，”船夫说。“偶尔会有一对夫妇，获得允许一起上岛，但这种情况很少。需要两人之间，有罕见的深爱紧紧相连。偶尔会有，这我不否认，所以如果遇到夫妻，甚至是还没有结婚的情人，要我们渡过去，我们就有责任仔细盘问他们。判断两人之间的爱是不是深到可以一起过去，这是我们的责任。这位女士不愿意承认，但她和她丈夫之间的爱就是太弱了。让她先扪心自问，然后再来说我那天的判断对不对。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The old woman gave no reply, nor any indication of having heard Axl's words. After some time, she rose slowly to her feet, the rabbit held closely to her chest. The woman was tiny in stature and her cloak dragged along the floor as she made her way to the broken side of the room. Some water splashed onto her from a section of the ceiling, but she seemed not to care. When she had reached the far end of the floor, she looked out at the rain and the encroaching greenery. Then bending slowly, she set the rabbit down near her feet. The animal, perhaps stiff with fear, did not move at first. Then it vanished into the grass.</div>

When I heard this I was only partly afraid, saying to myself it was nothing to do with us, Axl.
