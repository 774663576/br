His enthusiasm faded, his voice hesitated, his lips trembled, his eyes dropped in confusion. Tess walked rapidly away along the road.</div>

<div class="line_en">However, as she walked she felt he must be looking at her back as she walked away. And now she knew she could never escape the past, as she had hoped.

<div class="line_en">This was the first time she had seen or heard of D'Urberville since she had left Trantridge.

<div class="line_en">In March the threshing-machine came for a day to Flintcomb-Ash. It was a huge red machine which ate all the corn the farm-workers could feed it. Next to it stood the engine which ran it, and the engineer. He lived in a world of fire and smoke, and was permanently black, as if he came from hell. The farmer put Tess next to the threshing-machine, so that she had the hardest and most tiring job of all. She had little chance to talk or rest, and at lunch time was about to start eating when she noticed D'Urberville approaching. He had Changed his parson's clothes and now looked just like the young gentleman she had first met at Trantridge.</div>
