<div class="line_en">He has been seeing Maddy, the café's manager, for two months now. They have yet to tell the other staff officially, but suspect they probably know already. It has not been a passionate affair, more a gradual acceptance over the last year of an inevitable situation. To Dexter, it has all been a little too practical and matter-of-fact, and he is privately a little uncomfortable about the transition that Maddy has made from confidante to lover; it casts a shadow over the relationship, that it should have originated in such gloom.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="和咖啡馆经理马蒂的交往已经两个月了，他们没有公开，但员工们大概是知道了。他们并非一见钟情，而是自去年来日久生情的。对于德克斯特来说，这场恋爱太过现实和平淡，对于马蒂从密友过渡为爱人，他暗地里略感不自在。这种小阴郁也为他们的关系蒙上了一层阴影。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But it's true they get on very well, everyone says so, and Maddy is kind and sensible and attractive, long and slim, and a little awkward. She has ambitions to be a painter, and Dexter thinks she is good; small canvases hang in the café, and are sold occasionally. She is also ten years younger than he is -- he imagines Emma rolling her eyes at this -- but she is wise and smart and has been through her own share of unhappiness: an early divorce, various unhappy relationships. She is quiet, self-contained and thoughtful and has a melancholy air about her, which suits him at present. She is also compassionate and fiercely loyal; it was Maddy who saved the business during the time when he was drinking the profits and not turning up, and he is grateful to her for this. Jasmine likes her. They get on well enough, for the moment at least.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过他们事实上又相处得非常好，人人都这么说。马蒂善良明理，苗条迷人，又有一点点难以捉摸。她渴望成为画家，德克斯特也看好她。她的油画挂在店里，偶尔还能卖出几张。此外，她还比他小十岁——他能想象爱玛为此如何翻眼皮，却聪明睿智，也经历过不快：过早的离婚和各种不开心的恋爱体验。她安静寡言有思想，还有一种与现时的他很相衬的忧郁气质，她还富有同情心，又忠诚。那些他买醉的日子，是她把生意维持了下来，他对此非常感激。贾斯敏也喜欢她，和她相处融洽，至少目前如此。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It's a pleasant Saturday evening and he walks on alone through residential back streets until he reaches the flat, the basement and ground floor of a red-brick mansion block not too far from Hampstead Heath. The flat retains the smell and the wallpaper of the elderly couple who lived there before, and he has only unpacked a few essentials: the TV and DVD, the stereo. It's a frumpy kind of place, at the moment anyway, with its dado rails and appalling bathroom and its many other small rooms, but Sylvie insists that it has great potential, once they've knocked the walls through and sanded the floors. There's a great room for when Jasmine comes to stay, and a garden too. A garden. For a while he joked about paving it over, but has now decided that he is going to learn to garden, and has bought a book on the subject. Somewhere deep in his consciousness he has become aware of the concept of the shed. Soon, it will be golf and pyjamas in bed.</div>

<div class="line_en">Once inside and past the boxes that clutter the hall, he takes a shower then goes into the kitchen and orders Thai food to be delivered. In the living room he lies on the sofa and begins to compile a mental list of the things he must do before he can begin his task.</div>

<div class="line_en">"You too, Dexter. Look after yourself, won't you?" she says, her voice unsteady, then hangs up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你也是，德克斯特。照顾好自己吧。”她的嗓音有些发颤，说完就挂了电话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For a small, diverse circle of people, a previously innocuous date has taken on a melancholy weight, and there are certain calls that must now be made. He starts with Sue and Jim, Emma's parents in Leeds. The conversation is pleasant and straightforward enough and he tells them about the business, how Jasmine is getting on at school, repeating the conversation twice for both the mother and the father. "Well, that's all the news really," he tells Sue. "Just to say, you know, thinking of you today, and hope you're alright."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个纪念日正被一些人淡忘，但依旧有几个仍需去联系的人。他从爱玛住在利兹的父母苏和吉姆开始。交谈坦诚而愉快。他汇报了生意的情况、贾斯敏在学校的良好表现，同样的内容分别对这对父母亲讲了一遍。“嗯，所有的消息都在这儿了，”他告诉苏，“就是想告诉你们，嗯，今天想你们了。希望你们一切都好。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dexter continues to work through the list, speaking to his sister, his father, his ex-wife, his daughter. The conversations are brief, ostentatiously lighthearted and don't mention the significance of the day, but the subtext is always the same: "I'm fine." He phones Tilly Killick, but she is mawkish and over-emotional: "But how are you really sweetheart? I mean, really? Are you by yourself? Are you okay by yourself? Do you want us to come over?" Irritated, he reassures her, then ends the call as quickly and politely as he can. He calls Ian Whitehead in Taunton, but he's putting the kids to bed, the little sods, and it's not a good time. Ian promises he'll call back in the week and maybe even come down and see him sometime, and Dexter says that it's a great idea in full know ledge that it will never happen. There's a general sense, as in all the calls, that the worst of the storm has passed. Dexter will probably never speak to Ian Whitehead again and this is fine too, for both of them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="德克斯特接着和姐姐、父亲、前妻和女儿通话，寥寥几句，却不无刻意的轻描淡写，仿佛这是一个稀松平常的日子。但都传达了这样的潜台词：我过得挺好。他也拨了蒂莉·基利克的电话，收获了讨人厌的激动话语：“舌心，可是说真的，你好不好？我是说，真的好吗？你还是单身吗？你没问题吧？需要我们过来看你吗？”他恼火了，让她不必担心，尽可能礼貌面迅速地结束了通话。下一个是伊恩，不过他正在哄那些个小浑蛋睡觉，不方便说话，但保证会回电给他，甚至还想抽空来看他。德克斯特回答说这主意不错，心里却清楚这只是客套话。它毫无例外地传递了一个意思：最恶劣的风暴已经过去。德克斯特多半不会再同伊恩·怀特海德说话了。这对双方都好。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He eats supper with the television on, hopping channels and restricting himself to the solitary beer that came free with the delivery. But there's something saddening about eating alone, hunched over on the sofa in this strange house and for the first time that day he feels a rush of despair and loneliness. These days grief seems like walking on a frozen river; most of the time he feels safe enough, but there is always that danger that he will plunge through. Now he hears the ice creak beneath him, and so intense and panicking is the sensation that he has to stand for a moment, press his hands to his face and catch his breath. He exhales slowly through his fingers, then rushes into the kitchen and throws dirty plates into the sink with a clatter. He has a sudden overwhelming need to drink, and to keep on drinking. He finds his phone.</div>

<div class="line_en">"No, really. I'd rather be alone." He finds that the sound of her voice is enough to calm him, and he reassures her once more then says goodnight. When he is sure that there is no conceivable reason for anyone to call him back, he turns the phone off, draws the blinds, goes upstairs and begins.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，真的不用。我愿意一个人待着。”他发现她的声音就足以安抚他，再次向她保证自己没事，然后道了晚安。等确信不会有人再来电了，他关了手机，拉上百叶帘，上楼执行任务。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The spare bedroom contains nothing but a mattress, an open suitcase and seven or eight cardboard boxes, two of which are labelled "Emma 1" and "Emma 2" in her own handwriting in thick black marker pen. The last of Emma's possessions from his flat, the boxes contain notebooks, letters, wallets of photographs, and he carries them down to the living room and spends the rest of the evening unpacking them, sorting the meaningless ephemera -- ancient bank statements, receipts, old take-away menus, all of which he stuffs into a black bin-liner -- from the stuff he will send to her parents, and the items he would like to keep for himself.</div>

<div class="line_en">It's a Polaroid, taken in Paris during that summer, of Emma lying naked on a bed, legs crossed at the ankle, her arms stretched languidly above her head. The photo was taken on a drunken, amorous evening after watching Titanic in French on a black and white TV, and even though he found the photograph beautiful, she had snatched it from him and insisted that she would destroy it. The fact that she kept the Polaroid and secreted it away should please him, suggesting as it does that Emma liked the photo more than she let on. But it also slams him up against her absence once more, and he has to take a moment to catch his breath. He places the Polaroid back in the envelope and sits in silence to gather himself. The ice creaks beneath him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱玛亦身躺在床上，双脚脚踝相交，双臂慵懒地举过头顶。这是在那个巴黎夏季的某个醉意醺醺、情意绵绵的夜晚，他们在黑白电视上看完法语版的《泰坦尼克号》不久。他觉得照得很是迷人，她却从他手上夺下米，坚持要毁了它，其实竟是悄悄保留着。他不无欣慰，但一想到她已不在人世，心头不禁一震，呼吸困难起来。他将照片放回信封，静坐着调整心绪。冰层依旧吱嘎作响。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The way the material has been packed means that he works through it in reverse chronological order, digging back through the strata, starting with their years together as a couple, back through the Nineties and eventually, at the bottom of box 2, into the Eighties. First there are dummy covers from the "Julie Criscoll" novels, correspondence with her editor Marsha, press cuttings. The next layer reveals postcards and photos of Paris, including a snap of the famous Jean-Pierre Dusollier, dark-skinned and very handsome, the one that got away. In an envelope with Metro tickets, folded menus, a rental agreement in French, he stumbles on something that's so startling and affecting that he almost drops it on the floor.</div>

<div class="line_en">He continues. From the late Nineties he finds an assortment of birth announcements, wedding invitations and orders of service, an over-sized farewell card from the staff and pupils of Cromwell Road Comprehensive School and, stuffed in the same envelope, a series of letters from someone called Phil which are so sexually fixated and pleading that he quickly folds them up and stuffs them back into the envelope. There are flyers from Ian's comedy-improv nights and some tedious paperwork from solicitors concerning the purchase of the flat in E17. He finds a selection of witless picture postcards that he sent while travelling in the early Nineties -- "Amsterdam is MAD", "Dublin ROCKS". He is reminded of the letters he got in return, wonderful little packets of pale blue air-mail paper that he re-reads occasionally, and is embarrassed afresh by his callow twenty-four-year-old self: "VENICE COMPLETELY FLOODED!!!!". There's a copy of the photostat programme of "Cruel Cargo -- a play for young people by Emma Morley and Gary Cheadle" and then old essays, dissertations on "Donne's Women" and "Eliot and Fascism", a pile of postcard reproductions marked with the tiny holes from the pin-boards of student houses. He finds a cardboard tube and in it, rolled up tight, Emma's graduation certificate, untouched, he imagines, for nearly twenty years. He verifies this by looking at the date -- 14 July 1988. Eighteen years ago yesterday.</div>

<div class="line_en">He is pulling an absurd male model's face, sucking in his cheekbones and pouting while Emma wraps one arm around his neck, her face close to his, eyes wide, one hand pressed to her cheek as if star-struck. After this photo was taken they had gone to the graduation tea-party, the pub and then to the party at that house. He can't remember who lived there, only that the house was packed and virtually destroyed, the party spilling out onto the street and the back garden. Hiding from the chaos, they had found a spot on a sofa in the living room together and stayed rooted there all evening. This was where he had kissed her for the first time. He examines the graduation photo once again, Emma behind thick black frames, her hair a bottle red and badly cut, a little plumper in the face than he remembers her now, mouth split in a wide smile, her cheek pressed to his. He puts the photo to one side, and looks at the next.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他自视男模，表情古怪，颧骨凸出，两腮紧凹，嘴唇摄起，脖子被爱玛的一条胳膊搂着。她的脸贴着他的，眼睛大瞪，一手托腮，一副对明星表达崇拜的表情。他记得拍完照片后，他们一起去了毕业茶会、酒吧以及派对，派对场所破烂不堪，人头拥挤，一直堆到后花园及街上。混乱中，他们俩缩在起居室的沙发上避了一整晚，也是在这里，他第一次吻了她。再看看镶在黑色厚镜框里的瞬间，她的头发染成了暗红色，发型糟糕，脸庞比他记忆中的略为胖一些，嘴巴咧开笑着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But at some point she must have handed the camera to Tilly, because there is finally a sequence of Emma by herself, pulling mock-heroic faces in mortar board and gown, her spectacles perched bookishly on the end of her nose. He smiles, then gives a groan of amused shame as he finds a photo of his old self.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后，爱玛本人终于一连出现在照片里。她头戴学士帽，身披学士服，鼻子上架着一副眼镜，一脸嘲弄的表情。他看了直笑，待到面对自己早年的照片时，他不由自鄙地叹息。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In a torn paper wallet he finds the graduation photographs and flicks through them without any great nostalgia. Because the photos were taken by Emma herself she barely features in them, and he has forgotten many of the other students anyway; she was part of a different crowd in those days. Still, he is struck by the youth of the faces and also by the fact that Tilly Killick has the power to annoy him, even in a photo at a distance of nineteen years. A snap of Callum O'Neill, skinny and self-satisfied, is swiftly torn in two and plunged deep into the bin-bag.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一个撕坏的纸袋里出现了毕业照，他迫不及待地去翻看，却未起怀旧之情，因为作为拍摄者的爱玛鲜少露脸，而其他同学他多已淡忘了。那时的他们归属于不同的群体。但这些年轻的面孔还是让他不胜歉款，同时还惊讶于十九年前的蒂莉·基利克居然也能惹他心烦。此外还有一张卡勒姆·奥尼尔的快照，又瘦又骄做的样子，被他一把撕成两半，塞进垃圾袋。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="下一张是第二天上午照的。两人坐在山腰上，爱玛身穿紧身衣，脚蹬匡威高帮运动鞋。德克斯特有失得体地穿着白衬衫和黑色西装夹克———前夜的着装。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The summit of Arthur's Seat was disappointingly crowded with tourists and other graduating students, all whey-faced and shaky from last night's celebrations. Dex and Em raised their hands sheepishly in greeting to a few acquaintances, but tried to keep their distance, keen to avoid gossip even now that it was too late.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="亚瑟王座山的山顶拥挤得令人扫兴，到处都被因宿醉而脸色苍白、身体晃悠的新毕业生占据。德克斯和爱姆羞怯地举手向几位熟人打招呼，同时努力同他们保持距离，虽然被八卦显然已不可避免。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They wandered idly around the scrappy rust-coloured plateau, taking in the view from all angles. Standing at the stone column that marked the summit, they made the remarks they were obliged to make in such situations: how far they had walked and how they could see their house from here. The column itself had been scratched with graffiti: private jokes, "DG Was Here", "Scotland Forever", "Thatcher Out".</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们无所事事地在这片锈迹斑斑的高原上漫步，从各个角度看去。他们站在标志着山顶的石柱前，说出了在这种情况下他们不得不说的话：他们走了多远，从这里他们怎么能看到自己的房子。柱子本身也被涂鸦划伤了：“DG到此一游”，“苏格兰万岁”，“撒切尔滚蛋”，等等。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dexter laughed mechanically, but once again, self-consciousness was starting to creep in; now they were here it felt like a mistake, and independently they wondered if they should skip the picnic and simply clamber back down and head home. But neither of them was quite prepared to suggest this, and instead they found a hollow a short way from the summit where the rocks seemed to provide some natural furniture, and they settled here and unpacked the rucksack.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="德克斯不自然地笑着，尴尬饼忆感再次袭来。他们好像来错了地方，都暗自犹豫着是否该马上下山回家，但又谁也没开口，只是在附近找到了一条小径，在形似家具的岩石上坐下来，打开背包。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dexter popped the champagne, which was warm now and foamed forlornly over his hand and onto the heather. They took it in turns to swig but there was little sense of celebration and after a brief silence Emma resorted once more to remarking on the view. "Very nice."</div>
