<div class="line_en">I looked up from my cereal, which I was pondering rather than eating, and stared at Charlie in shock. I hadn't been following the conversation -- actually, I hadn't been aware that we were having a conversation -- and I wasn't sure what he meant.</div>

<div class="line_en">"What did I do?" I felt my face crumple. It was so unfair. My behavior had been above reproach for the past four months. After that first week, which neither of us ever mentioned, I hadn't missed a day of school or work. My grades were perfect. I never broke curfew -- I never went anywhere from which to break curfew in the first place. I only very rarely served leftovers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我做了什么？”我感到我的面部开始扭曲。太不公平了。我的行为在过去四个月无可指责。在那之后的一个礼拜，我们俩都没有再提起过，上学或者打工我都没有缺过一天。我的学分很高。我从没打破宵禁——我本来也没有去过任何会打破宵禁的地方。我也几乎不会做剩饭。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You want me to get into trouble?" I wondered, my eyebrows pulling together in mystification. I made an effort to pay attention. It wasn't easy. I was so used to tuning everything out, my ears felt stopped up.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我说错了，”他勉强让步到。“闷闷不乐还好一点——那还可以做些什么。你只是……毫无生气的，贝拉。我想这就是我想说的意思。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我很抱歉，爸爸。”我的道歉听起来有些沉闷，甚至我自己听来都是如此。我想我在欺骗他。我所有努力的重点就是希望使查理免受伤害。一旦想到这些努力都是枉然我是多么的绝望呀。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"But I handled it," he pointed out. "Honey, you're not handling it. I waited, I hoped it would get better." He stared at me and I looked down quickly. "I think we both know it's not getting better."</div>

<div class="line_en">In my haste to get away from Charlie, I ended up being one of the first ones to school. The plus side was that I got a really good parking spot. The downside was that I had free time on my hands, and I tried to avoid free time at all costs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我匆忙离开查理，结果我成了第一拨到达学校的人之一。好的方面是我得到了一个非常好的停车位。不好的就是我有了空闲的时间，我已经不惜代价去避免这些空闲的时间了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I forced myself to keep at it until the parking lot was full, and I ended up rushing to English. We were working on Animal Farm, an easy subject matter. I didn't mind communism; it was a welcome change from the exhausting romances that made up most of the curriculum. I settled into my seat, pleased by the distraction of Mr. Berty's lecture.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我强迫自己把注意力集中在微积分上直到停车场停满了车，我关上书跑去上英语课。我们正在学习《动物农场》，这是一个很简单的主题。我不反对动物主义，大部分的课程都是由令人疲惫不堪的罗曼史构成的，这是个不错的转变。我在我的座位上坐下来，很高兴贝尔蒂先生的讲课分散了我的注意力。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Quickly, before I could start thinking about Charlie's accusations, I pulled out my Calculus book. I flipped it open to the section we should be starting today, and tried to make sense of it. Reading math was even worse than listening to it, but I was getting better at it. In the last several months, I'd spent ten times the amount of time on Calculus than I'd ever spent on math before. As a result, I was managing to keep in the range of a low A. I knew Mr. Varner felt my improvement was all due to his superior teaching methods. And if that made him happy, I wasn't going to burst his bubble.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在我开始思考查理的指责之前，我快速的抽出我的微积分课本。我快速的翻到我们今天应该要上的章节，尝试弄明白它的意思。看懂数学比听懂更加困难，但是现在我的水平已经有所提高了。在过去几个月，我在微积分上所花费的时间是我以前在数学花费时间的十倍。结果，我已经可以保持在A减的行列了。我知道瓦纳先生把我的进步归因于他超凡的教学方法。如果这能使他开心的话，我不会去打破他的幻想。">查看中文翻译</div>

I knew I couldn't lie, though the thought of driving to Port Angeles and back alone -- being sure my odometer reflected the correct mileage, just in case he checked -- was very tempting. Jessica's mom was the biggest gossip in town, and Charlie was bound to run into Mrs. Stanley sooner rather than later. When he did, he would no doubt mention the trip. Lying was out.</div>

<div class="line_en">It seemed too coincidental that I should be in Port Angeles with Jessica, on a dark street even. My eyes focused on the short one, trying to match the features to my memory of the man who had threatened me that night almost a year ago. I wondered if there was any way I would recognize the man, if it was really him. That particular part of that particular evening was just a blur. My body remembered it better than my mind did; the tension in my legs as I tried to decide whether to run or to stand my ground, the dryness in my throat as I struggled to build a decent scream, the tight stretch of skin across my knuckles as I clenched my hands into fists, the chills on the back of my neck when the dark-haired man called me "sugar."</div>

<div class="line_en">I waited for the numbness to return, or the pain. Because the pain must be coming. I'd broken my personal rules. Instead of shying away from the memories, I'd walked forward and greeted them. I'd heard his voice, so clearly, in my head. That was going to cost me, I was sure of it. Especially if I couldn't reclaim the haze to protect myself. I felt too alert, and that frightened me.</div>

<div class="line_en">As much as I struggled not to think of him, I did not struggle to forget. I worried -- late in the night, when the exhaustion of sleep deprivation broke down my defenses -- that it was all slipping away. That my mind was a sieve, and I would someday not be able to remember the precise color of his eyes, the feel of his cool skin, or the texture of his voice. I could not think of them, but I must remember them.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a crippling thing, this sensation that a huge hole had been punched through my chest, excising my most vital organs and leaving ragged, unhealed gashes around the edges that continued to throb and bleed despite the passage of time. Rationally, I knew my lungs must still be intact, yet I gasped for air and my head spun like my efforts yielded me nothing. My heart must have been beating, too, but I couldn't hear the sound of my pulse in my ears; my hands felt blue with cold. I curled inward, hugging my ribs to hold myself together. I scrambled for my numbness, my denial, but it evaded me.</div>
