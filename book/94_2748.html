<div class="line_en">She waits until late at night, when it's dark enough for a child and a wurse to pass unseen under Britt-Marie's balcony, before she goes down to the cellar. George is out jogging; Mum is still out preparing everything for tomorrow. Since the meeting with the accountant this morning she's been talking endlessly on the telephone with the whale-woman from the undertaker's and the florist and the vicar and then with the hospital and the vicar again. Elsa has been sitting in her room reading Spider-Man, doing her best not to think of tomorrow. It hasn't gone very well.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="爱莎一点儿也不了解那个“暗影”。她只见过他两次，第一次在殡仪馆，还有一次是在去学校的公交车上。然后她就梦见了他，而现在他来这里找她了。密阿玛斯没有巧合，在童话故事里，所有一切都事出有因。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Fairy tales from Miamas tell of an infinite number of ways to defeat a dragon. But if this dragon is a shadow, the most evil kind of being one can possibly imagine, and yet it looks like a human, then what?

When he's afraid of snot and can't wash away the thought of blood from his own fingers?</div>

<div class="line_en">She brings the wurse some cookies she got from Maud and, once the contents have been mopped up, she has to snatch back the tin so quickly that she almost gets an incisor manicure. Granny always said that wurse saliva was bloody hard to get off in the washing-up, and Elsa is planning to give the tin back to Maud. But the wurse, who in all ways is a typical wurse, rummages quite ravenously in her backpack, apparently having considerable difficulty understanding how she could have come down with just one paltry tin for it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她带给呜嘶一些莫德给她的饼干。刚把饼干全倒完，她就不得不迅速抢回罐子，呜嘶的门牙差点儿给她修了个指甲。外婆总说，呜嘶的口水超难洗的，而爱莎还得把铁罐还给莫德呢。但呜嘶可是只典型的呜嘶，它急不可耐地在她的背包里翻找，显然不相信她只带了这么小一罐饼干给它。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'll try to get you some more cookies, but for now you're going to have to eat this." She opens a thermos. "This is sponge cake mix. I don't know how to mix it properly though," she mumbles apologetically. "I found it in the cupboard in the kitchen and it said 'ready sponge cake mix' on the packet, but it was only powder. So I added water. It's more like gunk than proper mix."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我会弄更多饼干给你的，但现在你只能吃这个了。”她打开一只保温杯。“这是海绵蛋糕粉，可我不知道该怎么弄。”她满怀歉意地说，“我在厨房柜子里找到的，包装上写着‘海绵蛋糕预调粉’，里面只有粉末。我加了点儿水。它变成了黏糊糊的一坨。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The wurse looks skeptical, but its towel-sized tongue immediately licks all the gunk out of the thermos anyway. Just to be on the safe side. An insanely flexible tongue is one of the most prominent superpowers of wurses.</div>

<div class="line_en">The wurse buffets its nose against her throat. She throws her arms around it, and feels the taut muscles under its fur. It tries to seem playful, but she understands that it's doing what wurses do best: preparing for battle. She loves it for that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="呜嘶用鼻子轻轻推了推她的脖子。她张开手臂抱住它，感受着皮毛下紧绷的肌肉。它看上去在闹着玩，但她知道它是在做呜嘶们最擅长的事：准备战斗。她因此而爱它。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The wurse buffets her throat again and looks at her with large, empathic eyes. It seems to be wishing it could tell her everything. Elsa wishes Wolfheart were here. She rang his bell just now but there was no answer. She didn't want to call out, in case Britt-Marie smelled a rat, but she made a loud sniffing sound through the mail slot to clearly signal she was about to sneeze the kind of sticky sneeze that instantly covers everything in camouflage paint. It had no effect.</div>

<div class="line_en">Elsa tries to be brave. It goes quite well while they are walking through the cellar. And it's quite okay while they go up the cellar stairs. But when they're standing in the vestibule inside the main door, she senses the smell of tobacco smoke, the same kind of tobacco that Granny used to smoke, and a lingering fear from her nightmare paralyzes her. Her shoes weigh a thousand tons. Her head thumps as if something has worked itself loose and is rattling around in there.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱莎努力鼓起勇气。穿过地下室时，这很成功。走上地下室台阶时，还算成功。但是当他们站在大门内侧的前厅时，爱莎闻到了一股烟草气味，而那烟草又跟外婆抽的一样，噩梦中那挥之不去的恐惧让她浑身麻痹。她的鞋子有千吨重。她的脑袋里“砰砰”直响，就好像有什么东西在里面跑来跑去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Of course, they shouldn't have said that, because there were actually an awful lot of things that Granny didn't "surely understand" at all. Also, unlike the man who owned the company that produced the free newspaper, she had a lot of spare time. "Never mess with someone who has more spare time than you do," Granny used to say. Elsa used to translate that as, "Never mess with someone who's perky for her age."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="很显然，他们不该那么说的，因为实际上有一大堆事情，外婆根本就不会“理解”。另外，跟免费报纸公司的老板不一样，外婆有很多空闲时间。“永远别惹比你闲的人。”外婆常说。爱莎会把这句话翻译成：“永远别惹以她的年纪来说太活泼的人。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Elsa remembers the time Granny called the newspaper office and gave them a roasting for putting the paper in her mail slot even though she had a "No junk mail, ever. Thanks!" message in surprisingly clear letters on the door. Elsa had thought a lot about why it said "Thanks!" because Elsa's mum always said that if one can't say thanks as if one means it, one may as well not bother. And it didn't sound like the note on Granny's door meant it at all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱莎想起那次外婆打电话给报社，狠狠骂了他们一顿，因为她已经在门上用特别清晰的字迹写了“别再投垃圾信件了。谢谢！”但他们还是在她的信箱里放了报纸。爱莎当时想了很久，为什么要写上“谢谢”，因为爱莎的妈妈总说，如果不能真心实意地说“谢谢”，那还不如不要说。外婆门上的字条怎么看都不像是出自真心。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But the people answering the telephone at the office of the newspaper told Granny their newspaper wasn't in the business of advertising but in fact "social information," which can be put in people's mailboxes irrespective of whether people thank them not to do so. Granny had demanded to know who owned the company that produced the newspaper, and after that she demanded a word with him. The people at the other end of the telephone line said that surely Granny could understand that the owner did not have time for this sort of nonsense.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但报社接电话的人对外婆说，他们的报纸并不做广告，而是传达“社交信息”，所以不管人们谢没谢他们，他们都可以在人们的信箱里投报纸。外婆问谁是报社老板，然后要求跟他说话。电话那头的人说，外婆应该能理解老板才没有空来管这档子无聊的事。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Whatever the case, you're actually not supposed to take those yellow carrier bags out of the store. Of course, Granny had just shrugged it off. "I never stole the bags, I just haven't given them back yet," she muttered, and gave Elsa a thick felt-tip pen to write with. And then Elsa said she wanted at least four tubs of Ben &amp; Jerry's New York Super Fudge Chunk for this. And then Granny said, "One!" and then Elsa said, "Three!" and then Granny said, "Two!" and then Elsa said, "Three, or I'm telling Mum!" and then Granny yelled, "I'm not negotiating with terrorists!" And then Elsa pointed out that if one looked up "terrorist" on Wikipedia there were quite a lot of things in the definition of the word that applied to Granny but not a single one that applied to Elsa. "The goal of terrorists is to create chaos, and Mum says that's exactly what you're busy doing all day long," said Elsa. And then Granny had agreed to give Elsa four tubs if she just took the felt-tip pen and promised to keep her mouth shut. And so that's what Elsa did. Late into the night she'd sat in the dark in Renault on the other side of town, on guard duty, while Granny ran in and out of houses' entrances with her yellow IKEA carrier bags. The next morning the man who owned the company that produced the free newspaper was woken by the neighbors ringing his doorbell, very upset because someone had apparently filled the lift with hundreds of copies of the free newspaper. Every mailbox was stuffed full of them, and every square inch of the large glass entrance door had been covered in taped-up copies, and outside every flat great tottering piles had been left that collapsed and fell down the stairs when the doors were opened. On every copy of the newspaper, the man's name had been written in large, neat felt-tip letters, and just below, "Complimentry social information, for yor reading plesure!!!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不管怎么说，人们都不应该把那些黄色袋子从店里拿走。外婆对此自然只是耸了耸肩。“我又没偷这些袋子，我只是还没把它们还回去罢了。”她喃喃说着，给了爱莎一支粗记号笔。爱莎说叫她干这事，起码要给她四桶BEN&amp;JERRY’S纽约超级软糖块冰激凌。外婆说：“一桶！”爱莎说：“三桶！”外婆说：“两桶！”爱莎说：“三桶！不然我就告诉妈妈！”外婆喊道：“我不跟恐怖分子谈判！”爱莎指出如果去维基百科上查“恐怖分子”，这个词的定义里会出现不少事情跟外婆有关，但绝没有一件是和爱莎有关系的。“恐怖分子的目标是要制造混乱，妈妈说你整天就专干这种事。”爱莎说。然后外婆就同意，如果爱莎拿好记号笔，保证不说出去，就给爱莎四桶冰激凌。所以爱莎就这么干了。那天晚上，在镇子另一头，她在黑暗中坐在雷诺里望风，而外婆则带着黄色宜家袋子在数栋公寓楼的大门口跑进跑出。第二天早上，免费报纸公司的老板被邻居们按他家门铃的声音吵醒，很不高兴。原来有人用几百份免费报纸塞满了电梯。每个信箱都被塞爆了，而大楼入口玻璃门一寸不落地都用胶带贴上了报纸，所有公寓外都堆着摇摇晃晃的报纸堆，门一开全倒在了楼梯上。在每一份报纸上，都用巨大清晰的字迹写着那老板的名字，名字下还写着：“免费社交信息，祝您阅读愉快！！！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the following days Granny had picked up Elsa as usual from school, and then they'd patrolled the block with yellow IKEA carrier bags, ringing all the doorbells. People seemed to find it a bit weird, especially since everyone knows you're actually not allowed to take those yellow IKEA bags from the store. If anyone started asking too many questions, Granny just said they were from an environmental organization collecting recyclable paper. And then people didn't dare make any more fuss. "People are afraid of environmental organizations, they think we'll storm the flat and accuse them of not handling their waste properly. They watch too many films," Granny had explained as she and Elsa loaded the stuffed carrier bags into Renault. Elsa never quite understood what kinds of films Granny had seen, and where that sort of thing would ever happen. She did know that Granny hated environmental organizations, which she called "panda fascists."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在接下去的几天里，外婆还是照常接爱莎下课，然后她们会带着黄色宜家袋子在社区里巡逻，按响每户门铃。人们觉得这有点儿奇怪，尤其是每个人都知道这些黄色宜家袋子事实上是不能带离店铺的。如果有人开始问太多问题，外婆就说她们是环保组织的，在回收废纸。之后，人们就不敢再大惊小怪了。“人人都害怕环保组织，他们觉得我们会冲进屋子，指责他们没有处理好垃圾分类。他们电影看多了。”外婆和爱莎一起把装满的袋子搬上雷诺时，她这么解释道。爱莎一直不太明白外婆看的是哪种电影，那种事情会在哪里发生。她只知道外婆讨厌环保组织，并称之为“熊猫法西斯”。">查看中文翻译</div>

They turn away. Alf looks unamused in every possible way by his uninvited company. Elsa clears her throat and tries to think of something to make small talk about, to keep him there.</div>
