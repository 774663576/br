<div class="line_en">Now on this night he would start on his journey to meet with Aspanu Pisciotta; he would place himself in the hands of the American, Michael Corleone. He would leave these mountains now. These mountains that had given him sanctuary for seven years. He would leave his kingdom, his power, his family, and all his comrades. His armies had melted away; his mountains were being overrun; his protectors, the people of Sicily, were being crushed by Colonel Luca's Special Force. If he remained he would win some victories, but his final defeat would be certain. For now, he had no choice.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the seventh year of his banditry, Turi Guiliano knew that he must leave his mountain kingdom and flee to the America he had been conceived in, the America his parents had always told stories about when he was a child. The fabulous land where there was justice for the poor, where the government was not the lackey of the rich, where the penniless Sicilians rose to riches simply by good honest labor.</div>

<div class="line_en">Turi Guiliano strapped on his lupara, took up his machine pistol and started on the long journey toward Palermo. He was wearing a white sleeveless shirt, but over this was a leather jacket with large pockets that held clips of ammunition for his weapons. He paced himself. His watch said nine o'clock, and there were still traces of daylight in the sky despite the timid light of the moon. There was the danger of roving patrols of the Special Force to Repress Banditry, yet Guiliano walked without fear. Over the years he had earned a certain invisibility. All the people in this countryside threw their cloaks about him. If there were patrols they would inform him; if he was in danger they would protect him and hide him in their houses. If he were attacked, the shepherds and the farmers would reassemble under his solitary banner. He had been their champion; they would never betray him now.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="图里·吉里安诺背上短筒猎枪，拿起冲锋手枪，开始了前往巴勒莫的跋涉。他穿着白色无袖衬衣，外面套了一件有大口袋的皮上衣，口袋里装着几梭子枪弹。他确定了自己的行进速度。他的表已经九点。尽管天上朦胧的月光依稀可见，但日光尚未完全退去。他随时都有碰上剿匪特种部队巡逻队的危险，可是他无所畏惧地向前走去。这些年来，他学会了如何隐蔽自己。这里的乡亲们都会掩护他。如果有巡逻队，他们就会告诉他；如果他处境危险，他们就会保护他，让他躲在他们的家里；如果他受到攻击，牧羊人和农民都会聚集到他的旗下。他是他们的捍卫者；他们绝不会背叛他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the months that followed his marriage, there were pitched battles between Colonel Luca's Special Force and segments of Guiliano's band. Colonel Luca had already taken credit for the killing of Passatempo, and the newspapers reported in huge headlines that one of Guiliano's most feared chiefs had been killed in a fierce gun battle with the heroic soldiers of the Special Force to Repress Banditry. Colonel Luca, of course, had suppressed the note left on the body, but Don Croce learned of it from Inspector Velardi. He knew then that Guiliano was fully aware of the treachery that had been done at the Portella della Ginestra.</div>

<div class="line_en">Terranova got unlucky, and it was his virtue that brought him misfortune. He had not the ferociousness of Passatempo, the malignant cunning of Pisciotta, the deadliness of Fra Diav o lo. Nor the ascetic quality of Guiliano. He was intelligent but he was also of an affectionate temperament, and Guiliano had often used him to make friends with their kidnapping victims, to distribute money and goods to the poor. It was Terranova and his own band that plastered Palermo with posters in the dead of night to present Guiliano's propaganda. He did not often take part in the more bloody operations.</div>

<div class="line_en">Colonel Luca's five thousand-man army exerted an intense pressure on Guiliano. He could no longer dare to enter Palermo to buy supplies or sneak into Montelepre to visit his mother and Justina. Many of his men were being betrayed and killed. Some were emigrating on their own to Algeria or Tunisia. Others were disappearing into hiding places that cut them off from the activities of the band. The Mafia was now in active opposition to him, using its network to deliver Guiliano's men into the hands of the carabinieri.</div>

<div class="line_en">Justina had visited Guiliano a few times in the mountains, and Terranova had been her bodyguard on her voyages. Her beauty had stirred his feelings of longing, and though he knew it was not prudent, he decided to visit his mistress one last time. He wanted to give her a sum of money that would sustain her and her children in the years to come.</div>

<div class="line_en">He was a man who required love and affection. A few years before, he had acquired a mistress in Palermo, a widow with three small children. She had never known he was a bandit; she thought he was a government official in Rome who took his holidays in Sicily. She was grateful for the money he gave her and the presents he brought for her children, but it had been made plain to her that they could never marry. And so she gave him the affection and care he needed. When he visited she cooked elaborate meals; she washed his clothes and made love with a grateful passion. Such a relationship could not remain a secret forever from the Friends of the Friends, and Don Croce stored the information away to be used at the proper time.</div>

He felt a happy satiety of the body, and his mind was at peace. He was relaxed and off guard.</div>

<div class="line_en">And so one night he sneaked into Palermo alone. He gave the widow the money and explained he might not be able to see her for a long time. She wept and protested and finally he told her who he really was. She was astonished. His usual demeanor was so mild, his nature was so gentle, and yet he was one of the famed Guiliano's great chiefs. She made love with a fiery passion that delighted him, and they spent a happy evening with the three children. Terranova had taught them to play cards, and when they won this time he paid them real money, which made them laugh with joy.</div>

<div class="line_en">Terranova took one last look at the cathedral, the statues of saints niched on its sides; he saw the blue and yellow balconies, the sun rising to light the azure sky.

<div class="line_en">Terranova's death brought a sense of doom to Guiliano. He had known that the reign of the band was finished. That they could no longer counterattack successfully, that they could no longer hide in the mountains. But he had always thought that he and his chiefs would make an escape, that they would not go down to death. Now he knew there was very little time left. There was one thing he had always wanted to do, and so he summoned Corporal Canio Silvestro.</div>

<div class="line_en">He took a great leap as if he would leap over death itself and hurl himself into a safe universe. As his body flew to one side and hit the ground, he drew his pistol and fired. One soldier reeled back and went down to one knee. Terranova tried to pull the trigger again, but by that time a hundred bullets converged on his body, blowing it to pieces, blowing the flesh off his bones. In one way he had been lucky -- it had all happened so quickly that he did not have time to wonder if his mistress had betrayed him.</div>

Then the bodies were dressed in the costumes that had been left for them and placed in glass coffins. These coffins were placed in niches in the wall or strung from the ceiling by glass wires.

There was a knight of the Royal Court in a blue silk ruffled uniform, a helmet on his head, a sword cane in his hand. A courtier, foppish in the French style, with white wig and high-heeled boots. There was a Cardinal in his red robes, an archbishop in his miter.

Guiliano knew that the operation had been perfectly planned. He had brooded on how to do it ever since he had learned the truth about the massacre at the Portella della Ginestra. The Don was so well guarded that a chink had to be found in his defenses. Guiliano had decided his best chance was when the Don felt secure in the heavily guarded Hotel Umberto of Palermo. The band had a spy in the hotel, one of the waiters. He gave the Don's schedule, the deployment of the guards. With this intelligence Guiliano was sure his attack would succeed.</div>

<div class="line_en">He had mustered thirty men to rendezvous with him in Palermo. He had known of Michael Corleone's visit and lunch with the Don, and so he waited until late afternoon when the report reached him that Michael had left. Then twenty of his men had mounted a frontal assault on the hotel to draw guards off from the garden. A few moments later he and his remaining ten men had planted an explosive charge against the garden wall and blown a hole in it. Guiliano led the charge through the hole. There were only five guards left in the garden; Guiliano shot one and the other four fled. Guiliano rushed into the Don's suite but it was empty. And it had struck him as strange that it was unguarded. Meanwhile the other detachment of his band had forced their way through the defense barrier and joined up with him. They had searched the rooms and corridors along the way and found nothing. The Don's huge bulk made it impossible for him to move quickly, so only one conclusion could be drawn. The Don had departed from the hotel shortly after Michael left. And now it occurred to Guiliano for the first time that Don Croce had been warned about the attack.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was too bad, Guiliano thought. It would have been a glorious last stroke, besides removing his most dangerous enemy. What ballads would have been sung if he had found Don Croce in that sunlit garden. But there would be another day. He would not stay forever in America.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="糟糕透顶，吉里安诺暗自思忖。这次袭击本来不仅能除掉他的心腹大患，而且也是辉煌的最后一击。如果在那个阳光灿烂的花园里他发现了唐·克罗切，那他谱写的该是怎样的篇章！不过来日方长，他不会永远待在美国的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On the third morning, the Cappuccini monk, his body and face almost as shrunken as the mummies in his charge, brought a message from Pisciotta. It read, "In the house of Charlemagne." Guiliano understood it immediately. Zu Peppino, the master carter of Castelvetrano, who had helped Guiliano in the hijacking of Don Croce's trucks and had been a secret ally of his band ever since, had three carts and six donkeys. All three of his carts had been painted with the legends of the great Emperor, and as boys, Turi and Aspanu had called his home the house of Charlemagne. The time of the meeting had already been set.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第三天上午，卡普奇尼修道院那个身子和脸都像他所管的木乃伊一样干瘪的修士带来了皮肖塔的信。信上说：“在查理大帝家。”吉里安诺立即明白了。祖·佩皮诺是卡斯特尔维特拉诺地区的车老板，有三辆大车和六只驴子，曾经帮助吉里安诺抢劫过唐·克罗切的卡车，而且打那以后就成了吉里安诺的秘密盟友。他的三辆大车上都画着查理大帝的传说。图里和阿斯帕努小时候就称他家为“查理大帝家”。见面时间是早就确定了的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That night, his final night in Sicily, Guiliano made his way to Castelvetrano. Outside of Palermo he picked up some shepherds who were secret members of his band and used them as an armed escort. They made their way to Castelvetrano with such ease that a suspicion flickered in Guiliano's mind. The town looked too open. He dismissed his bodyguards, who slipped away into the night. Then he made his way to a little stone house outside of Castelvetrano whose courtyard held three painted carts, now all bearing the legends from his own life. This was the house of Zu Peppino.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是吉里安诺在西西里的最后一个夜晚，当晚他要赶往卡斯特尔维特拉诺。在巴勒莫郊外，他挑选了几个牧羊人做他的武装保镖，他们都是他组织中的秘密成员。他们的卡斯特尔维特拉诺之行似乎太顺利了，吉里安诺不禁疑窦顿生。这座小镇似乎也太松懈了。他旋即让保镖快走，他们迅速消失在夜幕之中。接着他朝卡斯特尔维特拉诺城外一座小石屋走去。石屋的院子里有三辆大车，上面画的都是有关他的传奇。这就是祖·佩皮诺的房子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Zu Peppino did not seem surprised to see him. He put down the brush with which he had been painting the slat of one of his carts. The he locked the door and said to Guiliano, "We have trouble. You attract the carabinieri like a dead mule attracts flies."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="祖·佩皮诺看到他之后似乎并不感到惊讶。他放下正在其中一辆大车上绘画的笔，关上门后对吉里安诺说：“我们的情况不妙。你就像个招惹苍蝇的死骡子，把宪兵给引来了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Guiliano felt a little shock of adrenaline. "Are they Luca's Special Force?" he asked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉里安诺略感震惊。“是卢卡的特种部队吗？”他问道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes," Zu Peppino said. "They are tucked out of sight, not in the streets patrolling. I spotted some of their vehicles on the road when I came back from work. And some carters tell me they saw other vehicles. We thought they were setting up traps for members of your band, but we never suspected it might be you. You never get this far south, so far away from your mountains."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，”祖·佩皮诺说，“他们躲在暗处，没有在街上巡逻。我收工回家的路上看见了他们的一些车辆。有些车夫告诉我，他们还看见其他一些车辆。我们认为他们是在布设陷阱抓捕你们的人，但从来没想到会是你。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Guiliano wondered how the carabinieri could have known about the rendezvous. Had they trailed Aspanu? Were Michael Corleone and his people indiscreet? Or was there an informer? In any case, he could not meet Pisciotta in Castelvetrano. But they had a fallback meeting place if one of them did not show up at the rendezvous here.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉里安诺感到奇怪的是，宪兵怎么会知道这次秘密接头。难道他们在跟踪阿斯帕努？难道是迈克尔·柯里昂和他那些人麻痹了？或者是有人告密？不管怎么说，反正他不能在卡斯特尔维特拉诺与皮肖塔见面。如果他们两人中有一个没有在这儿露面，他们还有个备用的接头地点。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Zu Peppino said, "Allow an old man to embrace you." And he kissed Guiliano on the cheek. "I never believed you could help Sicily, nobody can, nobody ever could, not even Garibaldi, not even that windbag Il Duce. Now if you like I can put my mules to a cart and carry you wherever you want to go."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="祖·佩皮诺说：“让我这个老头儿拥抱你一下吧。”他在吉里安诺的面颊上吻了一下，“我从来就不相信你能救得了西西里。谁也救不了，从来就没有人能，就连加里波第也不行。那个吹牛皮的领袖7也没做到。如果你愿意，我可以套上车，把你送到你要去的地方。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Guiliano's rendezvous time with Pisciotta had been for midnight. It was now only ten. He had deliberately come in early to scout the ground. And he knew that the rendezvous with Michael Corleone was for dawn. The fallback meeting place was at least a two-hour fast walk from Castelvetrano. But it was better to walk than use Zu Peppino. He thanked the old man and slipped out into the night.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="见面时间在午夜。现在才十点。他是有意先来在这里侦察一下。他知道与迈克尔·柯里昂的见面时间在黎明。从这个备用接头地点到卡斯特尔维特拉诺，即使快速行进最少也要两个钟头，不过步行比坐佩皮诺的车要好。他向老人表示感谢，随后就消失在黑暗中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Thanks for the warning," Guiliano said. "Keep an eye out for Pisciotta in town and tell him. And when you take your cart to Montelepre, pay my mother a visit and tell her I am safely in America."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“谢谢你的提醒，”吉里安诺说，“在城里如果见到皮肖塔，就告诉他。如果你赶车去蒙特莱普雷，就去看看我母亲，告诉她我在美国很安全。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The fallback meeting place was the famous ancient Greek ruins called the Acropolis of Selinus. South of Castelvetrano, near Mazzara del Vallo, the ruins stood on a desolate plain near the sea, ending where the sea cliffs began to rise. Selinus had been buried by an earthquake before Christ was born, but a row of marble columns and architraves still stood. Or rather had been raised by excavators. There was still the main thoroughfare, though now reduced to rubble by the skeletons of ancient buildings lining its way. There was a temple with its roof matted with vines and showing holes like a skull and stone columns exhausted and gray with centuries of age. The acropolis itself, the fortified center of ancient Greek cities, was, as usual, built on the highest ground, and so these ruins looked down on the stark countryside below.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="备用接头地点在著名的古希腊废墟塞利努斯卫城。它位于卡斯特尔维特拉诺以南，离古罗马时期的玛扎拉壁垒不远，在一片濒临大海的荒原上，一直伸展到海岸峭壁旁。塞利努斯毁于公元前的一场地震，但是一排大理石柱和柱顶过梁依然挺立，抑或是被考古人员竖起来的。那条大马路至今犹在，不过它两侧的古建筑已成了一片碎石废墟。那里有座神庙，屋顶上爬满了藤蔓植物，就像一具上面有许多窟窿的头盖骨，那些历尽数百年风雨的石柱显得有气无力，垂老无比。卫城原本是古希腊城市防御体系的中心，通常建在最高处，所以从废墟上可以看见附近贫瘠的乡村。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a sight so beautiful that he forgot for a moment the danger he was in. The temple of Apollo had fallen in on itself in a twisted mass of columns. Other ruined temples gleamed in the moonlight -- without walls, just columns, strands of roof and one fortress wall with what had been a barred window high up, now blackly empty, the moon shining through it. Lower down in what had been the city proper, below the acropolis, one column stood alone, surrounded by flat ruins, that in its thousands of years had never fallen. This was the famous "Il Fuso della Vecchia," the Old Woman's Spindle. Sicilians were so used to the monuments of the Greeks scattered over the island that they treated them with affectionate contempt. It was only foreigners who made a fuss.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="眼前的美丽景色使吉里安诺暂时忘了自己的危险处境。向内坍塌的阿波罗神庙只剩下了一些东倒西歪的立柱，神庙的废墟在月光下闪着寒光——没有墙壁，只剩柱子和残存的顶，还有一段堡垒墙，它的上方曾经有一个带栏杆的窗，月光从那个黑洞洞的窗口照射下来。在较低处的原城址，在卫城下方耸立着一根柱子，虽历经千年却巍然屹立，而其四周则是已成平地的废墟。这就是著名的“老妪纺锤”。西西里人对这些散落在岛上的希腊纪念碑已经司空见惯，所以对它们既喜爱，又鄙视。只有外国人看了才大惊小怪。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The scirocco, a terrible desert wind, had been blowing all day. Now, at night, so close to the sea, it sent fog rolling through the ruins. Guiliano, weary of his long forced march, detoured around to the sea cliffs so he could look down and spy out the land.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="来自沙漠地区的西罗科风呼呼地刮了一整天。入夜之后，大风吹来的雾气笼罩了这片濒临大海的废墟。长途赶路后，吉里安诺感到疲惫，但他还是迂回爬上海边的峭壁，以便观察地面的动静。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He leaned back against one of the columns, glad to be resting, his body sagging with fatigue. The July moon seemed to pass over the gray-white columns and rest against the cliffs that led to the sea. And across the sea was America. And in America was Justina and their child to be born. Soon he would be safe and the last seven years of his banditry would be a dream. For a moment he wondered what kind of a life that would be, if he could ever be happy not living in Sicily. He smiled. One day he would come back and surprise them all. He sighed with fatigue and unlaced his boots and slipped his feet out of them. He took off his socks and his feet welcomed the touch of cold stone. He reached into his pocket and took out the two prickly pears and their sweet night-cooled juice refreshed him. With one hand on the machine pistol resting beside him, he waited for Aspanu Pisciotta.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他靠在一根柱子上，他的身体因疲劳而显得无力，能这样稍事休息，他还是很高兴的。七月的月亮似乎已越过灰白的立柱，倚在海边的峭壁上休息了。大洋那边就是美国。尤斯蒂娜已经到了那里，他们的孩子也将出生在那里。很快他就安全了，七年流亡生涯将化为一场梦。这时他在想，如果不生活在西西里也能幸福，那种生活将会是什么样子。他笑了。有朝一日他还要回来，他会使所有人都感到吃惊。他疲惫地叹了口气，解开靴带，把脚抽出来，然后脱下袜子，把脚踩在凉凉的石头上，感到非常舒服。他把手伸进衣袋，拿出两个仙人果，夜晚变得清凉甘甜的果汁给他注入了新的活力。他把手放在身边的冲锋手枪上，等待着阿斯帕努·皮肖塔的到来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And the foreigners had raised the twelve great columns that stood before him now. Their grandeur was Herculean, but behind them was only the panorama of ruins. At the foot of those twelve columns, abreast like soldiers fronting their commander full face, was a platform of stone steps that seemed to have grown out of the ground. Guiliano sat down on the top step, his back resting against one of the columns. He reached under his coat and unhooked the machine pistol and the lupara and put them one stone step below him. Fog swirled through the ruins, but he knew he would hear anyone who approached over the rubble and that he could easily see any enemies before they could see him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="眼前这十二根巨大的立柱是外国人重新竖起来的。它们的宏伟气势是大力神的象征，在它们后面也是一片废墟。从这些立柱的柱脚向上，有一截带石阶的平台，就像面对长官的一排士兵。吉里安诺坐在最高的石阶上，背靠着一根立柱。他把手伸进外衣，取下冲锋手枪和短筒猎枪放在脚下的石阶上。虽然废墟笼罩在大雾中，但他知道只要有人在废墟中行走，他就能听见声音，而且不等敌人发现他，他就能发现敌人了。">查看中文翻译</div>
