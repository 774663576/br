<div class="line_en">Maybe it helped people, maybe it didn't, he said (in a voice still cold, though he probably did not realize it), but as a surgeon I know I saved a few lives.</div>

<div class="line_en">Although the editor's words of praise pleased him, his son's metaphor struck him as forced and out of place. Unfortunately, I was the only casualty, he said. Thanks to those ideas, I can no longer operate on my patients.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="记者的赞美之词他很是受用，但儿子的比喻他觉得不妥，有些夸张。他说：“很不幸，这一刀，只有一个牺牲品，就是我。因为这篇文章，我再不能为病人做手术了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">From childhood, Tomas had associated the words helping people with one thing and one thing only: medicine. How could an article help people? What were these two trying to make him swallow, reducing his whole life to a single small idea about Oedipus or even less: to a single primitive no! in the face of the regime.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对托马斯而言，从他孩提时起，“帮人”这个词儿仅和一项行为相联系：行医。一篇报上的文章曾帮过什么人？这两个人想让他相信什么？他们把他的整个一生归结为对于俄狄浦斯的微不足道的思考，甚至还要少：归结为对当局发出的一个简单的“不”字。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Another silence set in. Tomas's son broke it. Ideas can save lives, too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="又静了下来。他儿子打破了沉默：“思想同样可以拯救生命。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">You know the best thing about what you wrote? the boy went on, and Tomas could see the effort it cost him to speak. Your refusal to compromise. Your clear-cut sense of what's good and what's evil, something we're beginning to lose. We have no idea anymore what it means to feel guilty. The Communists have the excuse that Stalin misled them. Murderers have the excuse that their mothers didn't love them. And suddenly you come out and say: there is no excuse. No one could be more innocent, in his soul and conscience, than Oedipus. And yet he punished himself when he saw what he had done.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="儿子继续说，可以感觉到他说话很费力：“你的文章里有种了不起的东西：拒绝妥协。而我们却正在丧失这种明辨善恶的能力。我们不再知道负罪感是个什么东西。人们找到了托辞：斯大林欺骗了他们。谋杀犯竟以母亲不爱他而感到失望为借口。突然，你道出了一切：没有任何借口。没有人在灵魂和良知上比俄狄浦斯更无辜。然而，看清了自己的所为之后，他惩罚了自己。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tomas tore his eyes away from his son's mouth and tried to focus on the editor. He was irritated and felt like arguing with them. But it's all a misunderstanding! The border between good and evil is terribly fuzzy. I wasn't out to punish anyone, either. Punishing people who don't know what they've done is barbaric. The myth of Oedipus is a beautiful one, but treating it like this.… He had more to say, but suddenly he remembered that the place might be bugged. He had not the slightest ambition to be quoted by historians of centuries to come. He was simply afraid of being quoted by the police. Wasn't that what they wanted from him, after all? A condemnation of the article? He did not like the idea of feeding it to them from his own lips. Besides, he knew that anything anyone in the country said could be broadcast over the radio at any time. He held his tongue.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="托马斯看着儿子脸上自己的嘴唇，努力将目光从那张嘴唇上移开，试图把注意力集中在记者身上。他感到不快，想反驳他们。他说：“你们要知道，这一切只是个误会。善与恶的界限极其模糊。我不要任何人受到惩罚，这不是我的初衷。惩罚一个不知道自己做了什么的人，是野蛮的行径。俄狄浦斯神话是很美。然而，以这种方式运用它…”他还想再说些什么，但，他想起他的话有可能正被录下来。他没有丝毫野心被几个世纪之后的历史学家援引。他倒是害怕被警察援引。因为警察要求他的，恰恰是对这篇文章的谴责。他不乐意警察听到他亲口说出来。他知道，在这个国家里说出的每一句话，都可能于某一天被拿去广播。他闭上了嘴巴。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Watching his own mouth in the boy's face, Tomas thought How strange to see one's own lips stammer.</div>

<div class="line_en">This time, the editor broke the silence. I understand. I don't like the idea of punishment, either. After all, he added, smiling, we don't call for punishment to be inflicted; we call for it to cease.</div>

<div class="line_en">What I wonder is what made me write the thing in the first place, said Tomas, and just then he remembered: She had landed at his bedside like a child sent downstream in a bulrush basket. Yes, that was why he had picked up the book and gone back to the stories of Romulus, Moses, and Oedipus. And now she was with him again. He saw her pressing the crow wrapped in red to her breast. The image of her brought him peace. It seemed to tell him that Tereza was alive, that she was with him in the same city, and that nothing else counted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我倒是在想，究竟是什么让我写了这篇文章。”托马斯说。他立刻回想了起来：她就像一个被弃在篮子中的孩子，顺流漂到他的床榻之岸。是的，就因为这个，他找来了那本书，重温了罗慕洛斯、摩西和俄狄浦斯的故事。突然，她出现了，他看到她在他面前，怀里搂着被红围巾包住的乌鸦。这个形象令他为之一振。这个形象的出现，是来告诉他：特蕾莎还活着，此时此刻和他在同一个城市里，除此以外，其他什么都不重要。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I wonder what's made you change your mind, said the editor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是什么令您改变主意？”记者问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I know, said Tomas. In the next few moments he would do something possibly noble but certainly, and totally, useless (because it would not help the political prisoners) and unpleasant to himself (because it took place under conditions the two of them had imposed on him).</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我明白。”托马斯说。他知道，几秒钟之后，他可能会做出一项举动，这一举动或许称得上慷慨，但可以肯定毫无用处（因为它根本帮不了政治犯），这一举动就个人而言，还令他不快（因为他是在被迫的情况下做的）。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Why even think about whether to sign or not? There was only one criterion for all his decisions: he must do nothing that could harm her. Tomas could not save political prisoners, but he could make Tereza happy. He could not really succeed in doing even that. But if he signed the petition, he could be fairly certain that she would have more frequent visits from under-cover agents, and that her hands would tremble more and more.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="为何还考虑要不要签名？他的所有决定仅依据一个标准：不做任何可能伤害特蕾莎的事情。托马斯不能拯救政治犯，但他可以令特蕾莎幸福。不，就连这个，他也做不到。但是，如果在请愿书上签了名，他几乎能肯定，警察骚扰她的次数还会更多，她的手会抖得更厉害。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Duty? His son reminding him of his duty? That was the worst word anyone could have used on him! Once more, the image of Tereza appeared before his eyes, Tereza holding the crow in her arms. Then he remembered that she had been accosted by an undercover agent the day before. Her hands had started trembling again. She had aged. She was all that mattered to him. She, born of six fortuities, she, the blossom sprung from the chief surgeon's sciatica, she, the reverse side of all his Es muss sein! -- she was the only thing he cared about.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="责任？儿子向他提起责任？这是他听到的最糟糕的字眼。特蕾莎双臂搂着乌鸦的形象再次出现在他眼前。他想起来，她告诉他，昨天晚上一个警察来酒吧纠缠她，她的手又开始颤抖。她也老了。他什么都不在乎，只在乎她。她，六次偶然的结果；她，是主任坐骨神经痛生成的花朵；她，是所有“es muss sein”的对立面；她，是他惟一真正在乎的东西。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He knew that his words were incomprehensible, but enjoyed them all the more for it. He felt a sudden, unexpected intoxication come over him. It was the same black intoxication he had felt when he solemnly announced to his wife that he no longer wished to see her or his son. It was the same black intoxication he had felt when he sent off the letter that meant the end of his career in medicine.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他知道这话令人费解，但自己深感满足。他感到一阵醉意向他袭来，突如其来，出乎意料。在向妻子宣布自己不想再看到她和儿子的那一天，他体验到同样的黑色的醉意。在往信箱里投下那封宣布放弃行医的信件的时候，他也体会到同样的黑色的醉意。">查看中文翻译</div>
