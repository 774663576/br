<div class="line_en">The girl moved in at the weekend. Will didn't say anything to Camilla or me, but I walked into the annexe on Saturday morning still in my pyjamas to see if Will needed any help, as Nathan was delayed, and there she was, walking up the hallway with a bowlful of cereal in one hand and the newspaper in the other. She blushed when she saw me. I don't know why -- I was wearing my dressing gown, all perfectly decent. I remember thinking afterwards that there had been a time when it had been perfectly normal to find pretty young things creeping out of Will's bedroom in the morning.</div>

<div class="line_en">When I told Camilla, I thought she'd be pleased. She had been so wretchedly cross about the girl moving in with her boyfriend, after all. But she just looked a bit surprised, and then adopted that tense expression which meant she was already imagining all sorts of possible and undesirable consequences. She didn't say as much, but I was pretty sure she was not keen on Louisa Clark. That said, I didn't know who it was Camilla approved of these days. Her default setting seemed to be stuck on Disapprove.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我告诉卡米拉时，原以为她会很高兴，毕竟那女孩搬去和她男友住时，卡米拉极其恼火。但她看上去只是有点吃惊，然后又是那副紧张的表情，那意味着她已经想象到了所有可能的不良后果。她没有说太多，但是我相当肯定她对露易莎•克拉克不感冒。真不知道卡米拉这些天称赞的是谁，她不置可否的表情似乎是在说不赞成。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Will had apparently told her that she could use his computer, but she refused, in favour of using those at the library. I don't know if she was afraid of being seen to be taking advantage, or if it was because she didn't want him to see whatever it was that she was doing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="威尔显然告诉过她可以用他的电脑，但是她拒绝了，她更喜欢用图书馆的电脑。我不知道她是不是怕别人认为她在占便宜，或者她不想让他知道她在做什么。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We never got to the bottom of what had prompted Louisa to stay -- Will just said "family issues" -- but she was a busy little thing. When she wasn't looking after Will, she was dashing around, cleaning and washing, whizzing backwards and forwards to the travel agent's and to the library. I would have known her anywhere in town because she was so conspicuous. She wore the brightest-coloured clothing of anyone I'd seen outside the tropics -- little jewel-hued dresses and strange-looking shoes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们从没刨根问底为什么露易莎周末待在这里——威尔只说是“家庭问题”。不过她是个没法闲下来的人，当她不在照看威尔时，她就忙上忙下，清洗、匆匆在旅行社来来回回，风风火火来往于图书馆。在小镇的任何地方都能一眼看到她，因为她太显眼了。她是我在热带地区以外见过的衣服颜色最亮丽的人——配上宝石色的小裙子和奇怪的鞋。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I would have said to Camilla that she brightened the place up. But I couldn't make that sort of remark to Camilla any more.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我本来可以告诉卡米拉她点亮了整个屋子，但是我不会再向卡米拉说这种话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Whichever it was, Will seemed a little happier when she was around. A couple of times I heard their conversations filtering through my open window, and I'm sure I heard Will laugh. I spoke to Bernard Clark, just to make sure he was quite happy with the arrangement, and he said it was a bit tricky as she had split up with her long-term boyfriend, and all sorts of things seemed to be up in the air at their home. He also mentioned that she had applied for some conversion course to continue her education. I decided not to tell Camilla about that one. I didn't want her to think what that might mean. Will said she was into fashion and that sort of thing. She was certainly easy on the eye, and had a lovely figure -- but, honestly, I wasn't sure who on earth would buy the kinds of things she wore.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无论如何，她在身边时威尔看起来要高兴些。好几次他们的谈话透过我开着的窗户飘进来，我确定听到了威尔的笑声。我跟巴纳德•克拉克交谈，想要确认一下他对这种安排是否满意，他说她跟长期交往的男朋友分手让人觉得有点微妙，所有的事情在他们家似乎都悬而未决。他还提到她申请了转换课程要继续受教育。这一点我决定不告诉卡米拉，我不想让她去揣摩这背后的含意。威尔说过她要进时尚圈的事情，她确实很好看，身材不错——但是，说实话，我拿不准到底谁会买她穿的那类衣服。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">On Monday evening, she asked if Camilla and I would come with Nathan into the annexe. She had laid out the table with brochures, printed timetables, insurance documents and other things that she'd printed off the internet. There were copies for each of us, in clear plastic folders. It was all terribly organized.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一个周一的晚上，她问卡米拉和我可不可以跟内森一起到配楼里来。她在桌上摆了小册子、打印出来的时间表、保险单据和其他从网上打印出来的东西，人手一份，装在透明的塑料文件夹里。太规整了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She wanted, she said, to present us with her plans for a holiday. (She had warned Camilla that she would make it sound like she was the one gleaning all the benefit, but I could still see Camilla's eyes grow a little steely as she detailed all the things she had booked for them.)</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她说，她想给我们看一下她的旅游计划。（她警告过卡米拉，她希望看起来像是她得到了所有好处，但她详细述说她订好的各项活动时，我仍然可以看到卡米拉的眼光有点冷冰冰的）">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was an extraordinary trip that seemed to involve all sorts of unusual activities, things I couldn't imagine Will doing even before his accident. But every time she mentioned something -- white-water rafting, or bungee jumping or what have you -- she would hold up a document in front of Will, showing other injured young men taking part, and say, "If I'm going to try all these things you keep saying I should, then you have to do them with me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是一次特别的旅行，包括了所有不寻常的活动，即便在威尔出事前，我都难以想象他会做这些事情。但是每次她提及某事——白浪漂流、蹦极等——她会在威尔面前举起一份文件，展示其他受伤的年轻人也参加过，然后说：“如果我们要尝试这些你一直说我应该做的事情，那你要和我一起做。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"If that's what you all want to do, then it's quite all right by me," Camilla said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“如果那就是你们想做的所有事情，那么我没意见。”卡米拉说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="似乎她讲了什么特别睿智的话，我儿子笑了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Where did you find all this information?" he said, finally.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你从哪里找来的信息？”最后他问道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"So…" Louisa said, when all the questions had been asked. "We will be leaving in eight days' time. Are you happy, Mrs Traynor?" There was a faint air of defiance in the way she said it, as if she were daring Camilla to say no.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那么……”所有问题都提出来后，露易莎说，“八天后我们出发。您还满意吗，特雷纳夫人？”她的话语中有一点挑衅的味道，似乎她确定卡米拉不敢说不。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We all looked at him. There was a time, not that long ago, when any one of these activities would have been unthinkable. There was a time when Will would have taken pleasure in saying no just to upset his mother. He had always been like that, our son -- quite capable of doing the opposite of what was right, simply because he didn't want to be seen to be complying, in some way. I don't know where it came from, this urge to subvert. Perhaps it was what made him such a brilliant negotiator.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们都看着他。有一段时间，就在不久之前，里面的任何一项活动都是不可想象的。有一段时间威尔以说“不”为乐，就是为了让他的母亲不安。他总是那样，我们的儿子——非常擅长做与正确的事情背道而驰的事情，仅仅因为他不想在某种程度上被人认为顺从。我不知道这种喜欢破坏的冲动从何而来，也许就是这些让他成为了一个卓越的谈判者。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She raised her eyebrows at him. "Knowledge is power, Will," she said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她扬了扬眉，说：“知识就是力量，威尔。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The girl seemed to physically deflate a little -- with relief -- as if she had half expected him to say no.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那女孩似乎从外表来看有点泄气——松了一口气——似乎她原以为他会拒绝。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It's funny -- I admit, when she first wound her way into our lives I was a little suspicious of her. Will, despite all his bluster, had been vulnerable. I was a little afraid that he could be manipulated. He's a wealthy young man, despite it all, and that wretched Alicia running off with his friend had made him feel about as worthless as anyone in his position could feel.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="真有趣——我觉得，她最初进入我们的生活时，我还有点怀疑她。威尔，尽管气势汹汹，却非常脆弱，我有点担心他被操纵。他是个有钱的年轻人，但是那个讨厌的艾丽西娅和他的朋友跑了，这让他觉得自己一文不值。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He looked up at me, his eyes unreadable, and I felt my jaw tense. And then he looked at the girl, and smiled.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他抬头看我，眼神捉摸不透，我下巴绷紧了。然后他看着她，笑了笑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Why not?" he said. "I'm quite looking forward to seeing Clark throw herself into some rapids."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“为什么不呢？”他说，“我极其期待看到克拉克纵身于急流。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But I saw the way Louisa looked at him then, a strange mixture of pride and gratitude on her face, and I was suddenly immensely glad that she was there. My son, although we never said as much, was in the most untenable of situations. Whatever it was she was doing, it seemed to be giving him just a small respite from that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我注意到露易莎看她的眼神，神情中奇怪地混合着骄傲和感激，我突然为她在那里感到非常高兴。我的儿子，虽然我们从没多说话，现在处在最不堪一击的情况下。不管她现在在做什么，似乎都让他有所喘息。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was, for a few days, a faint but definitely celebratory air in the house. Camilla wore an air of quiet hopefulness, although she refused to admit to me that that was what it was. I knew her subtext: what did we really have to celebrate, when all was said and done? I heard her on the telephone to Georgina late at night, justifying what she had agreed to. Her mother's daughter, Georgina, she was already looking for any way in which Louisa might have used Will's situation to advantage herself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="好几天家里都有一种微妙但是确切的喜庆氛围。卡米拉脸上带着一丝充满希望的表情，尽管她拒绝承认。我知道她的潜台词：当所有手续办妥之后，我们真正要庆祝的是什么呢？那天深夜我听见她在电话上跟乔治娜聊，为她同意的事情辩解。她自己的女儿，乔治娜，一直在寻找线索，以证明露易莎会利用威尔的处境为自己谋利。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“她提出她那份自己付钱，乔治娜。”卡米拉说道。还有，“不，亲爱的。我认为我们没有选择，我们的时间很少，威尔也同意了。我只希望有最好的结果，我真的觉得你现在也应该这样。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I knew what it cost her to defend Louisa, to even be nice to her. But she tolerated that girl because she knew, as I did, that Louisa was our only chance of keeping our son even halfway happy.</div>

<div class="line_en">Poor Della. I could see her fighting her instinctive urge to ask me about our future -- to consider how this unexpected development might affect it -- but I didn't suppose she ever would. Not until this was all resolved.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“威尔要去度假。”我说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We walked, watching the swans, smiling at the tourists splashing around in their boats in the early evening sun, and she chatted away about how this might all be actually rather wonderful for Will, and probably showed that he was really learning to adapt to his situation. It was a sweet thing for her to say as I knew that, in some respects, she might legitimately have hoped for an end to it all. It was Will's accident that had so curtailed our plans for a life together, after all. She must have secretly hoped that my responsibilities towards Will would one day end so that I could be free.</div>

<div class="line_en">And I walked along beside her, feeling her hand resting in the crook of my arm, listening to her sing-song voice. I couldn't tell her the truth -- the truth that just a handful of us knew. That if the girl failed with her ranches and her bungee jumping and hot tubs and what have you, she would paradoxically be setting me free.
