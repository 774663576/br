<div class="line_en">Emily and Anne had dogs, and they used to take them for walks on the moors. Anne's dog was called Flossy, and Emily had a big strong one called Keeper. Keeper went everywhere with her -- I think Emily loved that dog more than any person. Emily was sometimes a difficult child. She was very shy, and did not often speak to anyone outside the family. When she was older, I sent her to school with Charlotte, but she hated it, so I brought her home and sent Anne instead.</div>

<div class="line_en">Charlotte went to school again when she was fifteen. It was a much better school -- Miss Wooler's school at Roe Head. I don't think Charlotte liked school, but she wanted to be a teacher -- a governess -- so she worked hard. I taught Branwell at home, and Aunt Branwell taught Emily and Anne. The girls and Branwell were learning to play the piano, and Branwell played the music in church.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="夏洛蒂15岁时又去了学校。那是一所很好的学校——伍勒小姐学校的罗伊·海德分校。我觉得夏洛蒂不喜欢学校，但她想成为一名教师——家庭教师，为此她努力学习。我在家里教布兰韦尔，姨妈教爱米丽和安妮。同时他们也学弹钢琴，布兰韦尔还曾在教堂演奏。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When Branwell was fourteen or fifteen, he did a lot of oil-paintings. He painted people in the village, and it was easy to recognize the faces in the pictures. Later, he did a fine painting of his three sisters. I was very proud of him. We all decided he would become a famous artist.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布兰韦尔长到十四五岁时已经画了大量的油画。他画村子里的人，从画面上很容易认出那些人的面孔。后来他为3个姐妹精心地画了一幅画。我为他感到非常自豪，我们都认为他会成为一个有名的艺术家。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This was a sad time for me. My eyes were very bad, and I had to pay a young curate to help me with my work for the church. My old servant, Tabby, broke her leg and was very ill. And then one day I got a letter from Miss Wooler's school. My curate read it to me.</div>

<div class="line_en">Something terrible happened in London, but I don't know what it was. Branwell came back two weeks later, his face white, his clothes dirty. I don't know where he went or what happened in London. He refused to tell me. He just sat upstairs, alone in his room for hours.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在伦敦发生了一些可怕的事情。我也不知道究竟是怎么回事。两星期后他回来了，脸色苍白，衣衫褴褛。我不知道他在伦敦去了什么地方，也不知道出了什么事，他拒绝跟我讲。他只是在楼上自己的房间里一坐就是半天。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Branwell was not shy. He could talk to anyone for hours. Everyone in Haworth liked him. I remember the day in 1835 when Branwell went to London. He was eighteen years old, and he was going to the Royal Academy in London to learn to be an artist. He walked down the hill in Haworth with a bag of his best paintings on his back, and everyone in the village came out to see him go. That was a great day for me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布兰韦尔可不害羞。他可以和任何人谈上几小时。霍沃斯的每个人都喜欢他。记得1835年的一天，布兰韦尔要去伦敦。他18岁了，要到伦敦皇家学院学艺术。他从霍沃斯走下山去，背上的包里装着他最好的画，村里的人都出来为他送行。那一天真是我的好日子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Later, I paid for a room in Bradford for him to work in. He could paint pictures of famous people there, I thought. It was easy work for him. But he couldn't do it. He spent all my money, and came home again after a while.</div>
