<div class="line_en">I sat in the shadow of the dark-green cafe awning, staring down the length of the Rue des Francs Bourgeois, the tepid sun of a Parisian autumn warming the side of my face. In front of me the waiter had, with Gallic efficiency, deposited a plate of croissants and a large cup of filter coffee. A hundred yards down the street two cyclists stopped near the traffic lights and struck up a conversation. One wore a blue backpack from which two large baguettes poked at odd angles. The air, still and muggy, held the scents of coffee and patisserie and the acrid tang of someone's cigarettes.</div>

<div class="line_en">I finished Treena's letter (she would have called, she said, but she couldn't afford the overseas charges). She had come top of her year in Accountancy 2 and had a new boyfriend, Sundeep, who was trying to work out whether to work for his dad's import-export business outside Heathrow and had even worse taste in music than she did. Thomas was dead excited about moving up a class at school. Dad was still going great guns at his job, and sent his love. She was pretty confident that Mum would forgive me soon. She definitely got your letter, she said. I know she read it. Give her time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我看完了特丽娜的信（她说她本来要打电话的，但是她付不起国际长途费）。会计学2这门课程她考了第一名，她有了新男友，桑蒂普，他正在考虑要不要为他父亲在希思罗以外的进出口事业效力。他在音乐上的品位比她还糟。托马斯为能在学校升一级兴奋得要死。父亲的工作做得相当出色，向我问好。她相当确信母亲马上就会原谅我。她确实收到了你的信，她说，我知道她读了。给她一些时间。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I took a sip of my coffee, briefly transported to Renfrew Road, and a home that seemed a million miles away. I sat and squinted a little against the low sun, watching a woman in sunglasses adjust her hair in the mirror of a shop window. She pursed her lips at her reflection, straightened up a little, and then continued her path down the road.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我啜饮了一口咖啡，一瞬间似乎回到了伦费鲁路，回到了千里之外的家。低悬的太阳让我稍微眯起了眼，我看见一个戴着墨镜的女人对着商店橱窗的镜子整理自己的头发。她对着镜中的影像撅起了嘴，挺了挺身，然后继续向前走。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A few weeks will have passed by the time you read this (even given your newfound organizational skills, I doubt you will have made it to Paris before early September). I hope the coffee is good and strong and the croissants fresh and that the weather is still sunny enough to sit outside on one of those metallic chairs that never sit quite level on the pavement. It's not bad, the Marquis. The steak is also good, if you fancy coming back for lunch. And if you look down the road to your left you will hopefully see L'Artisan Parfumeur where, after you read this, you should go and try the scent called something like Papillons Extrême (can't quite remember). I always did think it would smell great on you.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="你读到这封信时应该过去了好几周时间了（即便凭借你新获得的组织协调技巧，我估计你也应当是在九月初以前到巴黎）。希望咖啡可口浓香，羊角面包新鲜，天气还足够暖和，你可以坐在外面的一张金属椅上，不过摆在人行道上的坐椅可从不稳当。侯爵咖啡馆还不算糟，里面的牛排也不错，如果你想在那里进午餐的话。沿着你左边的路往下看，你有望看到“阿蒂仙之香”，读完这封信，你可以去那里试试一种叫作“寻找蝴蝶终极版”的香水（不太记得名字了）。我一直觉得你很适合用这款香水。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Clark, I can practically hear you starting to hyperventilate from here. Don't start panicking, or trying to give it away -- it's not enough for you to sit on your arse for the rest of your life. But it should buy you your freedom, both from that claustrophobic little town we both call home, and from the kind of choices you have so far felt you had to make.</div>

<div class="line_en">You're going to feel uncomfortable in your new world for a bit. It always does feel strange to be knocked out of your comfort zone. But I hope you feel a bit exhilarated too.

<div class="line_en">I'm not really telling you to jump off tall buildings, or swim with whales or anything (although I would secretly love to think you were), but to live boldly. Push yourself. Don't settle. Wear those stripy legs with pride. And if you insist on settling down with some ridiculous bloke, make sure some of this is squirrelled away somewhere. Knowing you still have possibilities is a luxury. Knowing I might have given them to you has alleviated something for me.</div>
