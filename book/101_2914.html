<div class="line_en">Ellie and Brenda weren't back by seven. Jess had finished all the picking and helped his mother can the beans. She never canned except when it was scalding hot anyhow, and all the boiling turned the kitchen into some kind of hellhole. Of course, her temper had been terrible, and she had screamed at Jess all afternoon and was now too tired to fix any supper.</div>

<div class="line_en">Jess drew the way some people drink whiskey. The peace would start at the top of his muddled brain and seep down through his tired and tensed-up body. Lord, he loved to draw. Animals, mostly. Not regular animals like Miss Bessie or the chickens, but crazy animals with problems -- for some reason he liked to put his beasts into impossible fixes. This one was a hippopotamus just leaving the edge of the cliff, turning over and over -- you could tell by the curving lines -- in the air toward the sea below where surprised fish were leaping goggle-eyed out of the water. There was a balloon over the hippopotamus -- where his head should have been but his bottom actually was --"Oh!" it was saying. "I seem to have forgot my glasses."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杰斯画画的时候和有些人喝了威士忌一样。脑子里先是杂乱无章的，平和的心情从头顶开始，经过疲倦而紧张的身体徐徐地往下渗。上帝，他爱画画，画的大多数是动物。他画的动物，不是小母牛贝茜小姐或小鸡那样正常的动物，而是有问题的怪物——由于某种原因，他喜欢让他画出来的动物处在不可能发生的困境中。比如，这是一头河马，刚刚飞越一个个山峰——你可以从一道道曲线辨认出来——跳出了悬崖的边缘，在空中扑向下面的大海，海里的鱼惊恐得瞪大眼睛，跳出了水面。河马的上边有一个气球——就在原本应该是河马头的地方，但它的臀部却正在——“噢！”它正在说：“我似乎忘记戴眼镜了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">One day last winter he had given her one of his pictures. Just shoved it into her hand after class and run. The next Friday she had asked him to stay a minute after class. She said he was "unusually talented," and she hoped he wouldn't let anything discourage him, but would "keep it up." That meant, Jess believed, that she thought he was the best. It was not the kind of best that counted either at school or at home, but it was a genuine kind of best. He kept the knowledge of it buried inside himself like a pirate treasure. He was rich, very rich, but no one could know about it for now except his fellow outlaw, Julia Edmunds.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="去年冬季，有一天，他给了她一张他的画。仅仅是在下课和跑完步之后塞到她手里的。第二个星期的星期五，她叫他下课以后留一下。她说他“非常有天赋”，希望任何事情都不会使他泄气，要他“毫不松劲，继续努力”。杰斯认为，这就是说她感到他是最好的。这种最好，不是那种在学校或家里被认为的最好，而是一种名副其实的最好。他把这种认识深深埋在心里，就像海盗把掠得的珍宝深深地隐蔽起来一样。他是富有的，非常富有，但现在没有一个人知道他这种富有，只有他那不遵循常规的伙伴朱莉娅·艾徳梦丝小姐是例外。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She probably was. Jess wouldn't argue that, but he saw her as a beautiful wild creature who had been caught for a moment in that dirty old cage of a schoolhouse, perhaps by mistake. But he hoped, he prayed, she'd never get loose and fly away. He managed to endure the whole boring week of school for that one half hour on Friday afternoons when they'd sit on the worn-out rug on the floor of the teachers' room (there was no place else in the building for Miss Edmunds to spread out all her stuff) and sing songs like "My Beautiful Balloon," "This Land Is Your Land," "Free to Be You and Me," "Blowing in the Wind," and because Mr. Turner, the principal, insisted, "God Bless America."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她或许是。杰斯没有争论，但他把她看做是一只美丽的野生动物，那是他在学舍里那个又脏又旧的牢笼里抓到的，只抓了一会儿，可能只是无意的。但他希望，甚至祈求她不要挣脱，不要飞走。他为了星期五下午的半小时，努力忍受着整个星期无聊的上学。在星期五下午，他们坐在教师办公室破旧的地毯上（楼里再也没有别的地方供艾徳梦丝小姐摊开她所有的东西），唱歌，他们唱《我美丽的气球》、《这就是你的土地》、《自由去做你和我》、《随风飘荡》，由于校长特纳先生的坚持，还唱《天佑美国》。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But Jess knew what fakes they were. Sniffing "hippie" and "peacenik," even though the Vietnam War was over and it was supposed to be OK again to like peace, the kids would make fun of Miss Edmunds' lack of lipstick or the cut of her jeans. She was, of course, the only female teacher anyone had ever seen in Lark Creek Elementary wearing pants. In Washington and its fancy suburbs, even in Millsburg, that was OK, but Lark Creek was the backwash of fashion. It took them a long time to accept there what everyone could see by their TV's was OK anywhere else.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但杰斯知道他们是什么样的假货。他们嗤笑“嬉皮士”和“反战人士”，尽管越南战争已经结束，爱好和平应该又被认为是好的了。孩子们取笑艾徳梦丝小姐不涂唇膏，剪短了牛仔裤。当然，她是人们在云雀溪小学看到的唯一的一个穿裤子而不穿裙子的女教师。在华盛顿，在对穿着有鉴赏力的华盛顿郊区，甚至在米尔斯堡，那样是可以的，但在云雀溪不可以，云雀溪是时尚的禁地。每个人在电视上都能看到的东西，其他任何地方都认为可以的东西，要在云雀溪接受起来也还要花很长时间。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Miss Edmunds would play her guitar and let the kids take turns on the autoharp, the triangles, cymbals, tambourines, and bongo drum. Lord, could they ever make a racket! All the teachers hated Fridays. And a lot of the kids pretended to.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="艾徳梦丝小姐弹吉他，让孩子们轮流弹自动竖琴、敲三角铁、钹、鼓铃，拍小手鼓。上帝，他们怎么能发出喧闹声呢！而所有的老师都不喜欢星期五，很多孩子也假装不喜欢。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So the students of Lark Creek Elementary sat at their desks all Friday, their hearts thumping with anticipation as they listened to the joyful pandemonium pouring out from the teachers' room, spent their allotted half hours with Miss Edmunds under the spell of her wild beauty and in the snare of her enthusiasms, and then went out and pretended that they couldn't be suckered by some hippie in tight jeans with makeup all over her eyes but none on her mouth.</div>

<div class="line_en">Jess just kept his mouth shut. It wouldn't help to try to defend Miss Edmunds against their unjust and hypocritical attacks. Besides, she was beyond such stupid behavior.

Sometimes he felt so lonely among all these females -- even the one rooster had died, and they hadn't yet gotten another. With his father gone from sunup until well past dark, who was there to know how he felt? Weekends weren't any better. His dad was so tired from the wear and tear of the week and trying to catch up around the place that when he wasn't actually working, he was sleeping in front of the TV.</div>

<div class="line_en">Because he was more tired than usual, he had to push himself harder. He pretended that Wayne Pettis was there, just ahead of him, and he had to keep up. His feet pounded the uneven ground, and he thrashed his arms harder and harder. He'd catch him. "Watch out, Wayne Pettis," he said between his teeth. "I'll get you. You can't beat me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因为他比平常哪一天都累，所以必须更加使劲地催促自己。他设想韦恩·佩提斯在这儿，就在他前面，他必须赶上他。他的脚用力地蹬着不平的地面，两只手臂狠狠地前后摆动，而且摆动得越来越使劲。他要赶上他。“当心点，韦恩·佩提斯，”他低声说，“我会赶上你的，你赢不了我。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No," he said, shoving the sheet away. "I'm gonna fly."</div>

<div class="line_en">"If you're so afraid of the cow," the voice said, "why don't you just climb the fence?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有一个声音在说：“你这么怕奶牛，为什么不爬出围栏呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He paused in midair like a stop-action TV shot and turned, almost losing his balance, to face the questioner, who was sitting on the fence nearest the old Perkins place, dangling bare brown legs. The person had jaggedy brown hair cut close to its face and wore one of these blue undershirtlike tops with faded jeans cut off above the knees. He couldn't honestly tell whether it was a girl or a boy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他在半空中停了下来，像电视里的瞬时摄影镜头，然后向提问的人转过头，几乎失去了平衡。那个人就坐在最靠近珀金斯老宅的围栏上，两条褐色的光腿悬空挂着；褐色头发参差不齐，长短只到脸部；穿着汗衫似的蓝外衣，褪了色的牛仔裤剪短了，到了膝盖以上。老实说，他分辨不出那是男孩还是女孩。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I got work to do," he called back over his shoulder. When he came out later with the pail and stool, she was gone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他回过头来回答说：“我要干活。”过一会儿，他拿着矮凳，提着提桶回家，走出牛棚的时候，她已不在了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Girl, he decided. Definitely a girl, but he couldn't have said why he was suddenly sure. She was about his height -- not quite though, he was pleased to realize as she came nearer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他断定那是个女孩，肯定是个女孩，但他说不清为什么突然之间能那么肯定。她和他差不多高——但不那么有把握。当他理解到她是朝他走来的时候，心里很高兴。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Hi," he or she said, jerking his or her head toward the Perkins place. "We just moved in."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嗨，”他或她说着，朝珀金斯老宅扭了一下头，接着说，“我们刚搬进去。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She even had one of those dumb names that could go either way, but he was sure now that he was right.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Hey!" Leslie was standing in the middle of the cow field, her head tilted and her hands on her hips. "Where you going?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嘿！”莱斯利站在奶牛场的中央，歪着头，两手放在髋部，说：“你上哪儿去？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Is something the matter?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“有什么问题吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yeah. No." He pointed his thumb in the direction of his own house, and then wiped his hair off his forehead. "Jess Aarons." Too bad May Belle's girl came in the wrong size. "Well -- well." He nodded at her. "See you." He turned toward the house. No use trying to run any more this morning. Might as well milk Miss Bessie and get that out of the way.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，没有。”他用拇指指着自己住房的方向，然后撩开飘在前额的头发。说：“杰西·艾伦斯。”梅宝希望有女孩来了，但太遗憾了，个儿差的太多了。“哦——哦。”他向她点点头说：“再见。”说完，转过身就朝回家的方向走了。这个早上，想再跑一会已经没有用了。或许还可以给贝茜小姐挤奶，这样也能摆脱这个尴尬境地。">查看中文翻译</div>
