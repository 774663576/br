<div class="line_en">Since she had been working at the convent Kitty had seen less of Waddington. Two or three times he had come down to the river bank to meet her and they had walked up the hill together. He came in to drink a whisky and soda, but he would seldom stay to dinner. One Sunday, however, he suggested that they should take their luncheon with them and go in chairs to a Buddhist monastery. It was situated ten miles from the city and had some reputation as a place of pilgrimage. The Mother Superior, insisting that Kitty must have a day's rest, would not let her work on Sundays and Walter of course was as busy then as usual.</div>

<div class="line_en">They started early in order to arrive before the heat of the day and were carried along a narrow causeway between the rice-fields. Now and then they passed comfortable farm-houses nestling with friendly intimacy in a grove of bamboos. Kitty enjoyed the idleness; it was pleasant after being cooped up in the city to see about her the wide country. They came to the monastery, straggling low buildings by the side of the river, agreeably shaded by trees, and were led by smiling monks through courtyards, empty with a solemn emptiness, and shown temples with grimacing gods. In the sanctuary sat the Buddha, remote and sad, wistful, abstracted and faintly smiling. There was about everything a sense of dejection; the magnificence was shoddy and ruined; the gods were dusty and the faith that had made them was dying. The monks seemed to stay on sufferance, as though they awaited a notice to quit; and in the smile of the abbot, with his beautiful politeness, was the irony of resignation. One of these days the monks would wander away from the shady, pleasant wood, and the buildings, crumbling and neglected, would be battered by fierce storms and besieged by the surrounding nature. Wild creepers would twine themselves about the dead images and the trees would grow in the courtyards. Then the gods would dwell there no longer, but evil spirits of darkness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="为了避开中午的酷暑，他们一大早就动身出发，坐上轿子在稻田里的一条狭窄堤道上行进。时不时地会经过一处农舍，它们隐藏在竹林里，恰好与竹林相得益彰，远望去是一处十分养眼的风景。凯蒂乐得享受一回清闲，在城里关了这么久，难得欣赏乡村野外的风光。他们抵达了寺院，寺院其实就是坐落在河岸的几处低矮的房子，几棵参天大树将阴凉罩在房子上。一位面容和善的和尚带着他们穿过空旷静谧的庭院，来到一所庙堂，里面供奉着数排面目狰狞的神佛罗汉。佛龛内矗立着一尊佛陀像，面容淡远、慈悲，似在冥思，嘴角有一丝淡淡的笑意。佛堂内笼罩着一股阴沉悲戚的气氛，四处观瞧，表面上是富丽堂皇，但用料、工艺都属二流，而且已经略显褪色破败了。佛像上积了一层厚厚的尘土，而人们对佛陀顶礼膜拜的虔诚之心似乎也消亡不再了。打坐的和尚弟子似乎饱受痛苦的折磨，一旦令下便会如鸟兽散。方丈慈祥和善，谦恭有礼，但脸上有种行将退隐的自嘲之意。可以想见，不几日内，院内弟子便会从此阴凉惬意之地四散而去，而庙堂便从此败落，任由风雨侵蚀，草木蔓延。无人供奉的神像会饱受枝蔓缠绕，庭院内树木丛生。神佛菩萨自然会飞升而去，只剩邪灵恶鬼在其中出没了。">查看中文翻译</div>
