<div class="line_en">Starting from her musing she gave meaning to words which she had held meaningless in her mind for a long stretch of time. "Some one had blundered"-- Fixing her short-sighted eyes upon her husband, who was now bearing down upon her, she gazed steadily until his closeness revealed to her (the jingle mated itself in her head) that something had happened, some one had blundered. But she could not for the life of her think what.</div>

<div class="line_en">He shivered; he quivered. All his vanity, all his satisfaction in his own splendour, riding fell as a thunderbolt, fierce as a hawk at the head of his men through the valley of death, had been shattered, destroyed. Stormed at by shot and shell, boldly we rode and well, flashed through the valley of death, volleyed and thundered -- straight into Lily Briscoe and William Bankes. He quivered; he shivered.</div>

<div class="line_en">Not for the world would she have spoken to him, realising, from the familiar signs, his eyes averted, and some curious gathering together of his person, as if he wrapped himself about and needed privacy into which to regain his equilibrium, that he was outraged and anguished. She stroked James's head; she transferred to him what she felt for her husband, and, as she watched him chalk yellow the white dress shirt of a gentleman in the Army and Navy Stores catalogue, thought what a delight it would be to her should he turn out a great artist; and why should he not? He had a splendid forehead. Then, looking up, as her husband passed her once more, she was relieved to find that the ruin was veiled; domesticity triumphed; custom crooned its soothing rhythm, so that when stopping deliberately, as his turn came round again, at the window he bent quizzically and whimsically to tickle James's bare calf with a sprig of something, she twitted him for having dispatched "that poor young man," Charles Tansley. Tansley had had to go in and write his dissertation, he said.</div>

<div class="line_en">Already ashamed of that petulance, of that gesticulation of the hands when charging at the head of his troops, Mr Ramsay rather sheepishly prodded his son's bare legs once more, and then, as if he had her leave for it, with a movement which oddly reminded his wife of the great sea lion at the Zoo tumbling backwards after swallowing his fish and walloping off so that the water in the tank washes from side to side, he dived into the evening air which, already thinner, was taking the substance from leaves and hedges but, as if in return, restoring to roses and pinks a lustre which they had not had by day.</div>

It was like the cuckoo; "in June he gets out of tune"; as if he were trying over, tentatively seeking, some phrase for a new mood, and having only this at hand, used it, cracked though it was. But it sounded ridiculous --"Some one had blundered"-- said like that, almost as a question, without any conviction, melodiously. Mrs Ramsay could not help smiling, and soon, sure enough, walking up and down, he hummed it, dropped it, fell silent.</div>

<div class="line_en">He was safe, he was restored to his privacy. He stopped to light his pipe, looked once at his wife and son in the window, and as one raises one's eyes from a page in an express train and sees a farm, a tree, a cluster of cottages as an illustration, a confirmation of something on the printed page to which one returns, fortified, and satisfied, so without his distinguishing either his son or his wife, the sight of them fortified him and satisfied him and consecrated his effort to arrive at a perfectly clear understanding of the problem which now engaged the energies of his splendid mind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他安全了，恢复了自己的个人天地。他停下脚来点燃烟斗，看了一眼窗内的妻子和儿子，如同一个坐在特快列车上看书的人抬眼看见一个农场、一棵树、一片村舍，它们就像一幅插图，证实了书上的某个内容，于是他感到获得了鼓舞和满足，他的目光又回到了书页上。因此他虽然没有分辨出哪个是妻子哪个是儿子，但看到他们就感到是种鼓舞和满足，使他能把精力奉献给他非凡的头脑正在全力思考的问题的透辟理解上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was a splendid mind. For if thought is like the keyboard of a piano, divided into so many notes, or like the alphabet is ranged in twenty-six letters all in order, then his splendid mind had one by one, firmly and accurately, until it had reached, say, the letter Q. He reached Q. Very few people in the whole of England ever reach Q. Here, stopping for one moment by the stone urn which held the geraniums, he saw, but now far, far away, like children picking up shells, divinely innocent and occupied with little trifles at their feet and somehow entirely defenceless against a doom which he perceived, his wife and son, together, in the window. They needed his protection; he gave it them. But after Q? What comes next? After Q there are a number of letters the last of which is scarcely visible to mortal eyes, but glimmers red in the distance. Z is only reached once by one man in a generation. Still, if he could reach R it would be something. Here at least was Q. He dug his heels in at Q. Q he was sure of. Q he could demonstrate. If Q then is Q -- R --. Here he knocked his pipe out, with two or three resonant taps on the handle of the urn, and proceeded. "Then R…" He braced himself. He clenched himself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="确实是非凡的头脑。因为，如果思想如同钢琴上的键盘，分成如许数目的琴键，或像字母表，二十六个字母全按顺序排列，那么他那非凡的头脑就能毫无困难地把这些字母一个一个坚定而准确地过到，比如说，字母Q。他到达了Q。在整个英国，能到Q的人是很少的。这时他在种有天竺葵的石瓮旁驻足片刻，看见了妻子和儿子一起坐在窗口，可是现在离得已经很远了，看去就像拾贝壳的孩子，天真无邪，专心致志于脚旁的小东西，对于他已看到的厄运毫无防备。他们需要他的保护；他要给他们保护。但在Q后面是什么呢？下一个是什么？在Q后面有一连串字母，最后一个字母凡人的眼睛几乎无法看见了，只是在远处微微闪着红光。在一代人中，只有一个人能够到达z一次。不过，如果他能到达R那就相当不错了。这里至少是Q了。他在Q上稳稳站住脚跟。Q是他拿得稳的。Q是他能够论证的。那么如果Q就是Q——R——想到此处，他把烟斗在羊角形的石瓮把手上响亮地磕了两三下，磕灭了烟斗，继续考虑下去。“那么R……”他打起精神。他咬紧牙关。">查看中文翻译</div>

The geranium in the urn became startlingly visible and, displayed among its leaves, he could see, without wishing it, that old, that obvious distinction between the two classes of men; on the one hand the steady goers of superhuman strength who, plodding and persevering, repeat the whole alphabet in order, twenty-six letters in all, from start to finish; on the other the gifted, the inspired who, miraculously, lump all the letters together in one flash -- the way of genius.

<div class="line_en">He stood stock-still, by the urn, with the geranium flowing over it. How many men in a thousand million, he asked himself, reach Z after all? Surely the leader of a forlorn hope may ask himself that, and answer, without treachery to the expedition behind him, "One perhaps." One in a generation. Is he to be blamed then if he is not that one? provided he has toiled honestly, given to the best of his power, and till he has no more left to give? And his fame lasts how long? It is permissible even for a dying hero to think before he dies how men will speak of him hereafter. His fame lasts perhaps two thousand years. And what are two thousand years? (asked Mr Ramsay ironically, staring at the hedge). What, indeed, if you look from a mountain top down the long wastes of the ages? The very stone one kicks with one's boot will outlast Shakespeare. His own little light would shine, not very brightly, for a year or two, and would then be merged in some bigger light, and that in a bigger still. (He looked into the hedge, into the intricacy of the twigs.) Who then could blame the leader of that forlorn party which after all has climbed high enough to see the waste of the years and the perishing of the stars, if before death stiffens his limbs beyond the power of movement he does a little consciously raise his numbed fingers to his brow, and square his shoulders, so that when the search party comes they will find him dead at his post, the fine figure of a soldier?
