<div class="line_en">When all was quite ready, the Badger took a dark lantern in one paw, grasped his great stick with the other, and said, 'Now then, follow me! Mole first, 'cos I'm very pleased with him; Rat next; Toad last. And look here, Toady! Don't you chatter so much as usual, or you'll be sent back, as sure as fate!'</div>

<div class="line_en">When it began to grow dark, the Rat, with an air of excitement and mystery, summoned them back into the parlour, stood each of them up alongside of his little heap, and proceeded to dress them up for the coming expedition. He was very earnest and thoroughgoing about it, and the affair took quite a long time. First, there was a belt to go round each animal, and then a sword to be stuck into each belt, and then a cutlass on the other side to balance it. Then a pair of pistols, a policeman's truncheon, several sets of handcuffs, some bandages and sticking-plaster, and a flask and a sandwich-case. The Badger laughed good-humouredly and said, 'All right, Ratty! It amuses you and it doesn't hurt me. I'm going to do all I've got to do with this here stick.' But the Rat only said, 'PLEASE, Badger. You know I shouldn't like you to blame me afterwards and say I had forgotten ANYTHING!'</div>

<div class="line_en">It was cold, and dark, and damp, and low, and narrow, and poor Toad began to shiver, partly from dread of what might be before him, partly because he was wet through. The lantern was far ahead, and he could not help lagging behind a little in the darkness. Then he heard the Rat call out warningly, 'COME on, Toad!' and a terror seized him of being left behind, alone in the darkness, and he 'came on' with such a rush that he upset the Rat into the Mole and the Mole into the Badger, and for a moment all was confusion. The Badger thought they were being attacked from behind, and, as there was no room to use a stick or a cutlass, drew a pistol, and was on the point of putting a bullet into Toad. When he found out what had really happened he was very angry indeed, and said, 'Now this time that tiresome Toad SHALL be left behind!'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="地道里很冷，低矮狭窄，阴暗渐湿，可怜的蟾蜍禁不住哆嗦起来，一半由于害怕前面可能遇到的不测，一半由于他浑身湿透。灯笼在前面，离他很远，在黑暗中。他落到了后面。这时，他听到河鼠警告说：“快跟上，蟾蜍！”便猛地往前一冲，竟撞倒了河鼠，河鼠又撞倒了鼹鼠，鼹鼠又撞倒了獾，引起一阵大乱。獾以为背后遭到了袭击，由于洞内狭窄，使不开棍棒，便拔出手枪，正要朝蟾蜍射击。等真相大白后，他不禁大怒，说：“这回，可恶的蟾蜍必须留下！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Toad was so anxious not to be left out that he took up the inferior position assigned to him without a murmur, and the animals set off. The Badger led them along by the river for a little way, and then suddenly swung himself over the edge into a hole in the river-bank, a little above the water. The Mole and the Rat followed silently, swinging themselves successfully into the hole as they had seen the Badger do; but when it came to Toad's turn, of course he managed to slip and fall into the water with a loud splash and a squeal of alarm. He was hauled out by his friends, rubbed down and wrung out hastily, comforted, and set on his legs; but the Badger was seriously angry, and told him that the very next time he made a fool of himself he would most certainly be left behind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="蟾蜍生怕给留下，只好一声不吭地接受指派给他的次等位置，四只动物便出发了。獾领着大伙儿沿河走了一小段路，然后，他突然攀住河岸，身子摆动几下，荡进了一个略高出水面的洞。看到獾进了洞，鼹鼠和河鼠也一声不响地荡进了洞。轮到蟾蜍时，他偏要滑倒。扑通一声跌进水里，还惊恐地尖叫一声。朋友们拽他上来，把他从头到脚匆匆揉搓一过，拧了拧湿衣服，安慰几句，扶他站起来。獾可真火了。他警告蟾蜍说。要是下次再出洋相，准定把他丢下。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The passage now began to slope upwards; they groped onward a little further, and then the noise broke out again, quite distinct this time, and very close above them. 'Ooo-ray-ooray-oo-ray-ooray!' they heard, and the stamping of little feet on the floor, and the clinking of glasses as little fists pounded on the table. 'WHAT a time they're having!' said the Badger. 'Come on!' They hurried along the passage till it came to a full stop, and they found themselves standing under the trap-door that led up into the butler's pantry.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="地道这时开始向上倾斜，他们又摸索着走了一小段，然后，嘈杂声忽又出现，这回很清晰，很近，就在头顶上。“乌啦乌啦乌啦乌啦！”他们听到欢呼声，小脚掌跺地板声，小拳头砸桌子时杯盘的丁当声。“瞧他们闹得多欢哟！”獾说。“来呀！”他们顺着地道疾走，来到地道的尽头，发现他们已站在通向配膳室的那道活门的下面。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then suddenly they heard, far away as it might be, and yet apparently nearly over their heads, a confused murmur of sound, as if people were shouting and cheering and stamping on the floor and hammering on tables. The Toad's nervous terrors all returned, but the Badger only remarked placidly, 'They ARE going it, the Weasels!'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="忽然，他们听到低沉的嘈杂声，似乎很远，但显然就在头顶上，像有许多人在喊叫，欢呼，在地板上跺脚，用拳头捶桌子。蟾蜍的神经质的恐惧又袭上心来，可獾只是平静地说：“他们正闹腾哩，这群黄鼠狼！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But Toad whimpered, and the other two promised that they would be answerable for his good conduct, and at last the Badger was pacified, and the procession moved on; only this time the Rat brought up the rear, with a firm grip on the shoulder of Toad.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="蟾蜍呜呜咽咽哭了起来，另两只动物答应，他们将负责照看好蟾蜍，让他好好表现，獾才消了气，队伍又继续前进。不过这回换了河鼠断后，他牢牢地抓住蟾蜍的双肩。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So they groped and shuffled along, with their ears pricked up and their paws on their pistols, till at last the Badger said, 'We ought by now to be pretty nearly under the Hall.'</div>

<div class="line_en">Such a tremendous noise was going on in the banqueting-hall that there was little danger of their being overheard. The Badger said, 'Now, boys, all together!' and the four of them put their shoulders to the trap-door and heaved it back. Hoisting each other up, they found themselves standing in the pantry, with only a door between them and the banqueting-hall, where their unconscious enemies were carousing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="宴会厅里的喧嚣响声震天；他们没有被听到的危险。獾说：“好！弟兄们，一齐使劲！”他们四个同时用肩膀顶住活门，把它掀开，依次被举了上去。他们来到了配膳室，和宴会厅只隔着一道门，而敌人正在狂欢作乐，毫无觉察。他们从地道里爬出来时，喧闹声简直震耳欲聋。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The noise, as they emerged from the passage, was simply deafening. At last, as the cheering and hammering slowly subsided, a voice could be made out saying, 'Well, I do not propose to detain you much longer' --(great applause) --'but before I resume my seat' --(renewed cheering) --'I should like to say one word about our kind host, Mr. Toad.

<div class="line_en">Well might the terrified weasels dive under the tables and spring madly up at the windows! Well might the ferrets rush wildly for the fireplace and get hopelessly jammed in the chimney! Well might tables and chairs be upset, and glass and china be sent crashing on the floor, in the panic of that terrible moment when the four Heroes strode wrathfully into the room! The mighty Badger, his whiskers bristling, his great cudgel whistling through the air; Mole, black and grim, brandishing his stick and shouting his awful war-cry, 'A Mole! A Mole!' Rat; desperate and determined, his belt bulging with weapons of every age and every variety; Toad, frenzied with excitement and injured pride, swollen to twice his ordinary size, leaping into the air and emitting Toad-whoops that chilled them to the marrow! 'Toad he went a-pleasuring!' he yelled. 'I'LL pleasure 'em!' and he went straight for the Chief Weasel. They were but four in all, but to the panic-stricken weasels the hall seemed full of monstrous animals, grey, black, brown and yellow, whooping and flourishing enormous cudgels; and they broke and fled with squeals of terror and dismay, this way and that, through the windows, up the chimney, anywhere to get out of reach of those terrible sticks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="四位好汉愤怒地冲进宴会厅，就在这可怕的一刹那，发生了一场大恐慌，吓得魂不附体的黄鼠狼们纷纷钻到桌子底下，没命地跳窗夺路而逃，白鼬们乱哄哄地直奔壁炉，全都挤在烟囱里动弹不得。桌子东倒西歪，杯盘摔得粉碎。力大无穷的獾，络腮胡子根根倒竖，手中的大棒在空中呼呼挥舞；脸色阴沉严峻的鼹鼠抡着木棒，高呼令人胆寒的战斗口号：“鼹鼠来了！鼹鼠来了！”河鼠腰间鼓鼓囊囊塞满了各式武器，坚决果敢；奋不顾身地投入战斗；蟾蜍呢，由于自尊心受伤而发狂，身躯涨得比平时大出一倍，他腾空而起，发出癞蛤蟆那哇哇的怪叫，吓得敌人毛骨悚然，手脚冰凉。“叫你唱‘蟾蜍寻开心’！”他大吼道。“我就要拿你们寻开心！”他向黄鼠狼头子直扑过去。其实他们才四个，可是那些惊慌失措的黄鼠狼觉得，整个大厅似乎满是可怖的动物，灰色的、黑色的、棕色的、黄色的，怒吼狂叫，挥舞着巨大无比的棍棒。他们吓得魂飞魄散，恐怖地尖叫着，跳出窗子，窜上烟囱，四面逃窜，不管什么地方，只要能躲开那些可怕的棍棒。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">'Mole,' he said,' 'you're the best of fellows! Just cut along outside and look after those stoat-sentries of yours, and see what they're doing. I've an idea that, thanks to you, we shan't have much trouble from them to-night!'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“鼹鼠，”他说，“你是好样的！劳你抄近道出去，瞧瞧那些白鼬守卫，看他们都在干什么；我估摸，由于你的功劳。咱们今晚不致受他们骚扰了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Mole vanished promptly through a window; and the Badger bade the other two set a table on its legs again, pick up knives and forks and plates and glasses from the debris on the floor, and see if they could find materials for a supper. 'I want some grub, I do,' he said, in that rather common way he had of speaking. 'Stir your stumps, Toad, and look lively! We've got your house back for you, and you don't offer us so much as a sandwich.' Toad felt rather hurt that the Badger didn't say pleasant things to him, as he had to the Mole, and tell him what a fine fellow he was, and how splendidly he had fought; for he was rather particularly pleased with himself and the way he had gone for the Chief Weasel and sent him flying across the table with one blow of his stick. But he bustled about, and so did the Rat, and soon they found some guava jelly in a glass dish, and a cold chicken, a tongue that had hardly been touched, some trifle, and quite a lot of lobster salad; and in the pantry they came upon a basketful of French rolls and any quantity of cheese, butter, and celery. They were just about to sit down when the Mole clambered in through the window, chuckling, with an armful of rifles.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="鼹鼠马上跳窗出去。獾指示另两个扶起一张桌子，从地上的残渣中捡出一些刀叉杯盘，又叫他们看看能不能找到一些食物，拼凑出一顿晚饭。“我需要吃点什么，真的，”他用惯常的平平常常的语气说，“动弹动弹，蟾蜍，活跃起来！我们替你夺回了宅子，可你连块三明治也没招待我们呀。”蟾蜍心里有些委屈，因为獾没有像对鼹鼠那样赞扬他，没有说他是好样的，战斗得很英勇。因为他对自己的表现颇为得意，特别是他冲那黄鼠狼头子直扑过去，一棍子将他打到桌子那边去了。不过，他还是和河鼠一道四下里搜寻，不一会，他们就找到一玻璃碟子的番石榴酱，一只冷鸡，一只还没怎么动过的口条，一些葡萄酒蛋糕，不少的龙虾沙拉。在配膳室里，他们发现了一篮子法式面包卷，一些乳酪、黄油和芹菜。他们刚要坐下来开吃，就见鼹鼠抱着一堆来复枪，格格笑着从窗口爬进来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The affair was soon over. Up and down, the whole length of the hall, strode the four Friends, whacking with their sticks at every head that showed itself; and in five minutes the room was cleared. Through the broken windows the shrieks of terrified weasels escaping across the lawn were borne faintly to their ears; on the floor lay prostrate some dozen or so of the enemy, on whom the Mole was busily engaged in fitting handcuffs. The Badger, resting from his labours, leant on his stick and wiped his honest brow.</div>

<div class="line_en">'It's all over,' he reported. 'From what I can make out, as soon as the stoats, who were very nervous and jumpy already, heard the shrieks and the yells and the uproar inside the hall, some of them threw down their rifles and fled. The others stood fast for a bit, but when the weasels came rushing out upon them they thought they were betrayed; and the stoats grappled with the weasels, and the weasels fought to get away, and they wrestled and wriggled and punched each other, and rolled over and over, till most of 'em rolled into the river! They've all disappeared by now, one way or another; and I've got their rifles. So that's all right!'</div>

<div class="line_en">'Excellent and deserving animal!' said the Badger, his mouth full of chicken and trifle. 'Now, there's just one more thing I want you to do, Mole, before you sit down to your supper along of us; and I wouldn't trouble you only I know I can trust you to see a thing done, and I wish I could say the same of every one I know. I'd send Rat, if he wasn't a poet. I want you to take those fellows on the floor there upstairs with you, and have some bedrooms cleaned out and tidied up and made really comfortable. See that they sweep UNDER the beds, and put clean sheets and pillow-cases on, and turn down one corner of the bed-clothes, just as you know it ought to be done; and have a can of hot water, and clean towels, and fresh cakes of soap, put in each room. And then you can give them a licking a-piece, if it's any satisfaction to you, and put them out by the back-door, and we shan't see any more of THEM, I fancy. And then come along and have some of this cold tongue. It's first rate. I'm very pleased with you, Mole!'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“太好了，顶顶了不起！”獾说，嘴里塞满了鸡肉和葡萄酒蛋糕。“现在，鼹鼠，我只求你再办一件事，然后就坐下来和我们一道吃晚饭。我本不想再麻烦你，可托你办事，我能放心。我希望对我认识的每个人都能这样说就好了。河鼠若不是一位诗人，我会差他去的。我要你把地板上躺着的这些家伙带到楼上，命他们把几间卧室打扫干净，收拾妥帖。叫他们务必扫床底下，换上干净的床单枕套，掀开被子的一角，该怎么做，你知道的。每间卧室里备好一罐热水，干净毛巾，新开包的肥皂。然后，要是你想解解气，可以给他们每人一顿拳脚；再撵出后门。我估摸，今后没有一个家伙再敢露面了。完事之后，就过来吃点这种冷口条。这可是头等美味。我对你非常满意，鼹鼠！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The goodnatured Mole picked up a stick, formed his prisoners up in a line on the floor, gave them the order 'Quick march!' and led his squad off to the upper floor. After a time, he appeared again, smiling, and said that every room was ready, and as clean as a new pin. 'And I didn't have to lick them, either,' he added. 'I thought, on the whole, they had had licking enough for one night, and the weasels, when I put the point to them, quite agreed with me, and said they wouldn't think of troubling me. They were very penitent, and said they were extremely sorry for what they had done, but it was all the fault of the Chief Weasel and the stoats, and if ever they could do anything for us at any time to make up, we had only got to mention it. So I gave them a roll a-piece, and let them out at the back, and off they ran, as hard as they could!'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="好性子的鼹鼠拾起一根棍子，把他的俘虏们排成一行，命令他们“快步走！”把他的一小队人马带上楼去了。过了一阵子，他又下来，微笑着说，每间房都准备好了，打扫得干干净净。他又说：“我用不着揍他们，总的来说，我想他们今晚挨揍挨够了。我把这话告诉他们，他们表示同意，说再也不骚扰我们了。他们很懊悔，对过去的所作所为深感歉疚，说那是黄鼠狼头子和白鼬的错，又说如果今后可以为我们出力，将功补过，我们只消言语一声。所以，我给了他们一人一个面包卷，放他们出后门，他们就一溜烟似的溜啦。”">查看中文翻译</div>

The Badger was pleased at that, and said, 'There spoke my brave Toad!' So they finished their supper in great joy and contentment, and presently retired to rest between clean sheets, safe in Toad's ancestral home, won back by matchless valour, consummate strategy, and a proper handling of sticks.</div>

<div class="line_en">The following morning, Toad, who had overslept himself as usual, came down to breakfast disgracefully late, and found on the table a certain quantity of egg-shells, some fragments of cold and leathery toast, a coffee-pot three-fourths empty, and really very little else; which did not tend to improve his temper, considering that, after all, it was his own house. Through the French windows of the breakfast-room he could see the Mole and the Water Rat sitting in wicker-chairs out on the lawn, evidently telling each other stories; roaring with laughter and kicking their short legs up in the air. The Badger, who was in an arm-chair and deep in the morning paper, merely looked up and nodded when Toad entered the room. But Toad knew his man, so he sat down and made the best breakfast he could, merely observing to himself that he would get square with the others sooner or later. When he had nearly finished, the Badger looked up and remarked rather shortly: 'I'm sorry, Toad, but I'm afraid there's a heavy morning's work in front of you. You see, we really ought to have a Banquet at once, to celebrate this affair. It's expected of you-in fact, it's the rule.'</div>

<div class="line_en">'Don't pretend to be stupider than you really are,' replied the Badger, crossly; 'and don't chuckle and splutter in your coffee while you're talking; it's not manners. What I mean is, the Banquet will be at night, of course, but the invitations will have to be written and got off at once, and you've got to write 'em. Now, sit down at that table-there's stacks of letter-paper on it, with "Toad Hall" at the top in blue and gold-and write invitations to all our friends, and if you stick to it we shall get them out before luncheon. And I'LL bear a hand, too; and take my share of the burden. I'LL order the Banquet.'</div>

He quitted the room, accordingly, in the direction of the kitchen, and as soon as the door had closed behind him, Toad hurried to the writing-table. A fine idea had occurred to him while he was talking. He WOULD write the invitations; and he would take care to mention the leading part he had taken in the fight, and how he had laid the Chief Weasel flat; and he would hint at his adventures, and what a career of triumph he had to tell about; and on the fly-leaf he would set out a sort of a programme of entertainment for the evening-something like this, as he sketched it out in his head: --</div>

Toad swaggered out and found it was one of the prisoners of the previous evening, very respectful and anxious to please. He patted him on the head, shoved the bundle of invitations into his paw, and told him to cut along quick and deliver them as fast as he could, and if he liked to come back again in the evening, perhaps there might be a shilling for him, or, again, perhaps there mightn't; and the poor weasel seemed really quite grateful, and hurried off eagerly to do his mission.</div>

Otter, who was standing on the hearthrug, describing to an admiring circle of friends exactly how he would have managed things had he been there, came forward with a shout, threw his arm round Toad's neck, and tried to take him round the room in triumphal progress; but Toad, in a mild way, was rather snubby to him, remarking gently, as he disengaged himself, 'Badger's was the mastermind; the Mole and the Water Rat bore the brunt of the fighting; I merely served in the ranks and did little or nothing.'

<div class="line_en">At intervals he stole a glance at the Badger and the Rat, and always when he looked they were staring at each other with their mouths open; and this gave him the greatest satisfaction. Some of the younger and livelier animals, as the evening wore on, got whispering to each other that things were not so amusing as they used to be in the good old days; and there were some knockings on the table and cries of 'Toad! Speech! Speech from Toad! Song! Mr. Toad's song!' But Toad only shook his head gently, raised one paw in mild protest, and, by pressing delicacies on his guests, by topical small-talk, and by earnest inquiries after members of their families not yet old enough to appear at social functions, managed to convey to them that this dinner was being run on strictly conventional lines.</div>

<div class="line_en">After this climax, the four animals continued to lead their lives, so rudely broken in upon by civil war, in great joy and contentment, undisturbed by further risings or invasions. Toad, after due consultation with his friends, selected a handsome gold chain and locket set with pearls, which he dispatched to the gaoler's daughter with a letter that even the Badger admitted to be modest, grateful, and appreciative; and the engine-driver, in his turn, was properly thanked and compensated for all his pains and trouble. Under severe compulsion from the Badger, even the barge-woman was, with some trouble, sought out and the value of her horse discreetly made good to her; though Toad kicked terribly at this, holding himself to be an instrument of Fate, sent to punish fat women with mottled arms who couldn't tell a real gentleman when they saw one. The amount involved, it was true, was not very burdensome, the gipsy's valuation being admitted by local assessors to be approximately correct.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这次盛会之后，四只动物继续过着欢快惬意的生活，这种生活曾一度被内战打断，但以后再也没有受到动乱或入侵的干扰。蟾蜍和朋友们商量后，选购了一条漂亮的金项链，配有一只镶珍珠的小匣子，外加一封连獾也承认是谦虚知恩的感谢倍，差人送给狱卒的女儿。火车司机也因他付出的辛劳和遭到的风险，得到了适当的酬谢和补偿。在獾的严厉敦促下，就连那位船娘，也费了颇大周折找到，适当地赔偿了她的马钱。尽管蟾蜍对此暴跳如雷，极力申辩说，他是命运之神派来惩罚那个臂上长色斑的胖女人的，因为她明白面对一位绅士，却有眼不识泰山。酬谢和赔偿的总额，说实在的，倒也不算太高。那吉卜赛人对马的估价，据当地评估员说，大体上符合实际。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sometimes, in the course of long summer evenings, the friends would take a stroll together in the Wild Wood, now successfully tamed so far as they were concerned; and it was pleasing to see how respectfully they were greeted by the inhabitants, and how the mother-weasels would bring their young ones to the mouths of their holes, and say, pointing, 'Look, baby! There goes the great Mr. Toad! And that's the gallant Water Rat, a terrible fighter, walking along of him! And yonder comes the famous Mr. Mole, of whom you so often have heard your father tell!' But when their infants were fractious and quite beyond control, they would quiet them by telling how, if they didn't hush them and not fret them, the terrible grey Badger would up and get them. This was a base libel on Badger, who, though he cared little about Society, was rather fond of children; but it never failed to have its full effect.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在长长的夏日黄昏，四位朋友有时一起去野林散步。野林现在已被他们整治得服服帖帖了。他们高兴地看到，野林居民们怎样恭恭敬敬向他们问好，黄鼠狼妈妈们怎样教导她们的小崽子，把小家伙们带到洞口，指着四只动物说：“瞧，娃娃！那位是伟大的蟾蜍先生！他旁边是英勇的河鼠，一位无畏的战士。那一位，是著名的鼹鼠先生，你们的父亲常说起的！”要是娃娃们使性子，不听话，妈妈们就吓唬说，要是他们再闹，再烦人，可怕的大灰獾就会把他们抓走。其实，这是对獾的莫大诬蔑，因为獾虽不大喜欢同人交往，却挺喜欢孩子的。不过，黄鼠狼妈妈这样说，总是很奏效的。">查看中文翻译</div>
