<div class="line_en">Meanwhile, all around her the tantalizing work of assembling the expedition was going on day and night. She hung around Adam Stefanski, watching as he made his choice of the volunteers for the fighting force. She pestered Roger van Poppel with suggestions about the stores they needed to take: Had he remembered snow goggles? Did he know the best place to get arctic maps?</div>

<div class="line_en">And even if she got to the coast on her own, she might stow away on the wrong ship. It would be a fine thing to hide in a lifeboat and wake up on the way to High Brazil.</div>

<div class="line_en">Over the next few days, Lyra concocted a dozen plans and dismissed them impatiently; for they all boiled down to stowing away, and how could you stow away on a narrowboat? To be sure, the real voyage would involve a proper ship, and she knew enough stories to expect all kinds of hiding places on a full-sized vessel: the lifeboats, the hold, the bilges, whatever they were; but she'd have to get to the ship first, and leaving the fens meant traveling the gyptian way.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在随后的几天里，莱拉想出了十几个计划，但马上又急不可耐地全都放弃了，因为这些计划最终都是要偷偷地搭船，可怎么才能偷偷地搭上狭窄的运河船呢？当然，真正远航的时候是要用大小适当的船的，她知道很多故事，这足以让她想到正常大小的船上各种藏身的地方；但是，她首先得上船，而离开沼泽地就意味着得按照吉卜赛人的方式进行。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The man she most wanted to help was Benjamin de Ruyter, the spy. But he had slipped away in the early hours of the morning after the second roping, and naturally no one could say where he'd gone or when he'd return. So in default, Lyra attached herself to Farder Coram.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I think it'd be best if I helped you, Farder Coram," she said, "because I probably know more about the Gobblers than anyone else, being as I was nearly one of them. Probably you'll need me to help you understand Mr. de Ruyter's messages."</div>

<div class="line_en">She could hardly take her eyes off Farder Coram's daemon, who was the most beautiful daemon she'd ever seen. When Pantalaimon was a cat, he was lean and ragged and harsh, but Sophonax, for that was her name, was golden-eyed and elegant beyond measure, fully twice as large as a real cat and richly furred. When the sunlight touched her, it lit up more shades of tawny-brown-leaf-hazel-corn-gold-autumn-mahogany than Lyra could name. She longed to touch that fur, to rub her cheeks against it, but of course she never did; for it was the grossest breach of etiquette imaginable to touch another person's daemon. Daemons might touch each other, of course, or fight; but the prohibition against human-daemon contact went so deep that even in battle no warrior would touch an enemy's daemon. It was utterly forbidden. Lyra couldn't remember having to be told that: she just knew it, as instinctively as she felt that nausea was bad and comfort good. So although she admired the fur of Sophonax and even speculated on what it might feel like, she never made the slightest move to touch her, and never would.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莱拉几乎无法把自己的目光从法德尔·科拉姆的精灵身上挪开，那是她见过的最漂亮的一个精灵。潘特莱蒙变成老鼠的时候，显得瘦小、破落、粗糙，但是索福纳克斯——这是法德尔·科拉姆精灵的名字——却长着一双金色的眼睛，显得极为优雅；她足有两个真老鼠那么大，身上的毛非常细密。阳光照在她身上，反射出五颜六色的光，茶色、棕色、草绿色、米黄色、成熟的秋色、红褐色…多得连莱拉都说不上来。她很想摸一下她的毛皮，在自己的脸上蹭一蹭，当然，她从来没这样做过，因为在人们能想像出来的所有的失礼行为中，触摸另一个人的精灵最为粗鲁。当然，精灵彼此之间可以相互触摸，或者打架；但是，人与精灵之间不能接触的禁忌影响很深，甚至在战斗中，也没有武士会触及敌人的精灵——这是绝对禁止的。莱拉记不得曾有谁告诉过她：反正她就是知道这个禁忌，完全是出于本能，就跟她觉得恶心不好、舒服好一样。因此，尽管她很喜欢索福纳克斯的毛皮，甚至脑子里还在想像它的手感如何，但她从来没有做过任何哪怕一点点的举动，去触摸她，今后也永远不会。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sophonax was as sleek and healthy and beautiful as Farder Coram was ravaged and weak. He might have been ill, or he might have suffered a crippling blow, but the result was that he could not walk without leaning on two sticks, and he trembled constantly like an aspen leaf. His mind was sharp and clear and powerful, though, and soon Lyra came to love him for his knowledge and for the firm way he directed her.</div>

She had seen it when she accompanied the Librarian of Jordan to a service there. At the height of the invocation the Intercessor lifted the cloth to reveal in the dimness a glass dome inside which there was something too distant to see, until he pulled a string attached to a shutter above, letting a ray of sunlight through to strike the dome exactly. Then it became clear: a little thing like a weathervane, with four sails black on one side and white on the other, that began to whirl around as the light struck it. It illustrated a moral lesson, the Intercessor explained, and went on to explain what that was. Five minutes later Lyra had forgotten the moral, but she hadn't forgotten the little whirling vanes in the ray of dusty light. They were delightful whatever they meant, and all done by the power of photons, said the Librarian as they walked Home to Jordan.</div>
