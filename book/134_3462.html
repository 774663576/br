<div class="line_en">She walked to the hotel. In her room, she wet a face towel with cold water to put over her eyes. The room was chilly, so she took off her dress and shoes and got into bed.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the middle of the block, she opened the door of a coffee shop, but they were playing one of the songs she had heard with Carol everywhere, and she let the door close and walked on. The music lived, but the world was dead. And the song would die one day, she thought, but how would the world come back to life? How would its salt come back?</div>

<div class="line_en">From outside, a shrill voice, muted in empty space, cried: "Hey, Chicago Sun-Times!"</div>

<div class="line_en">Then silence, and she debated trying to fall asleep, while fatigue already began to rock her unpleasantly, like drunkenness. Now there were voices in the hall, talking of a misplaced piece of luggage, and a sense of futility overwhelmed her as she lay there with the wet, medicinally smelling face towel over her swollen eyes. The voices wrangled, and she felt her courage running out, and then her will, and in panic she tried to think of the world outside, of Dannie and Mrs. Robichek, of Frances Cotter at the Pelican Press, of Mrs. Osborne, and of her own apartment still in New York, but her mind refused to survey or to renounce, and her mind was the same as her heart now and refused to renounce Carol. The faces swam together like the voices outside. There was also the face of Sister Alicia, and of her mother. There was the last room she had slept in at school. There was the morning she had sneaked out of the dormitory very early and run across the lawn like a young animal crazy with spring, and had seen Sister Alicia running crazily through a field herself, white shoes flashing like ducks through the high grass, and it had been minutes before she realized that Sister Alicia was chasing an escaped chicken.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后是一片静默。她想要入睡，疲惫感正在轻轻摇晃着她，令她觉得不舒服，像喝醉了一样。外面走廊上传来声音，有人说到放错一件行李。她躺在那里，用那条沾湿了、闻起来有药水味道的毛巾盖在肿胀的眼睛上，一种无力感征服了她。外面的声音在争执，她感到自己的勇气和意志力已经耗尽。在仓皇中她试着想象外面的世界，想起丹尼还有罗比谢克太太，想起鹈鹕出版社的弗兰西斯·科特，想起奥斯朋太太，还有她自己还在纽约的公寓。她的心智拒绝继续思索，却也停歇不下来；她的理智和她现在的心一样，不肯放弃卡罗尔。这些脸孔汇聚在一起，就像外面的声音一样。还有，艾莉西亚修女的脸、她母亲的脸也出现了。她想起在学校里睡的最后一间房间。她想起自己一大早偷溜出宿舍，像小动物一样狂奔过学校草坪。她想起有次看见艾莉西亚修女发狂似地跑过操场，白色的鞋子闪闪发光，就像鸭子穿梭经过茂密的草丛一样，好几分钟之后她才明白过来，艾莉西亚修女正在追着一只逃跑的鸡。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was the moment, in the house of some friend of her mother's, when she had reached for a piece of cake and had upset the plate on the floor, and her mother had slapped her in the face. She saw the picture in the hall at school, it breathed and moved now like Carol, mocking and cruel and finished with her, as if some evil and long-destined purpose had been accomplished. Therese's body tensed in terror, and the conversation went on and on in the hall obliviously, falling on her ear with the sharp, alarming sound of ice cracking somewhere out on a pond.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她还想起有次在她母亲朋友的家里，她伸手去拿一块蛋糕，不小心把盘子打翻在地上，她母亲打了她一巴掌。她又看到学校大堂上的画像，那幅画有了呼吸，还有动作，就像卡罗尔一样，对她发出讥讽，对她冷酷以待，而且跟她断绝关系，仿佛某种邪恶又注定出现的目的已经达成。特芮丝的身体因为恐惧而紧绷了起来，外面走廊上的对话还在一直继续下去，传来尖锐的、令人心惊的声音，宛如池塘上的浮冰碎裂一样，落在她的耳边。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She sat up in bed with the end of a bad dream in her head. The room was nearly dark, its shadows deep and solid in the corners. She reached for the lamp switch and half closed her eyes against the light. She dropped a quarter into the radio on the wall, and turned the volume quite loud at the first sound she got. It was a man's voice, and then music began, a lilting, Oriental-sounding piece that had been among the selections in music appreciation class at school. "In a Persian Market," she remembered automatically, and now its undulant rhythm that had always made her think of a camel walking took her back to the rather small room at the Home, with the illustrations from Verdi operas around the walls above the high wainscoting. She had heard the piece occasionally in New York, but she had never heard it with Carol, had not heard it or thought of it since she had known Carol, and now the music was like a bridge soaring across time without touching anything. She picked up Carol's letter opener from the bed table, the wooden knife that had somehow gotten into her suitcase when they packed, and she squeezed the handle and rubbed her thumb along its edge, but its reality seemed to deny Carol instead of affirm her, did not evoke her so much as the music they had never heard together. She thought of Carol with a twist of resentment, Carol like a distant spot of silence and stillness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她在床上坐了起来，噩梦的结尾还萦绕在她的脑海里。房间几乎是全暗的，角落里潜伏着深重的阴影。她伸手去摸灯的开关，在灯光下半闭着眼睛。她把两毛五分钱铜板丢进嵌在墙上的收音机里，一听到收音机出现声音，立即把音量调大。是个男人的声音，之后开始放起快节奏的、听起来有东方风味的乐曲，也是以前在学校音乐欣赏课上听过的乐曲。她想起这首作品就是《波斯市场》，起伏的旋律总是让她联想到骆驼在走路，听到这首曲子，让她回忆起儿童之家小小的房间，墙上悬挂着取材自威尔第歌剧作品主题的插画。她在纽约的时候，也偶尔听到过这首曲子，但从来没有和卡罗尔一起去过。自从她认识卡罗尔以后，就再也没有听过或想到它过了。但现在音乐就像一座桥一样逐渐出现，跨越时间，又没有真正碰触到任何具体的事物。她从床边桌上拿起卡罗尔的木制拆信刀，她们在打包行李的时候，这把刀不知怎么搞的就跑进了她的行李箱。她触摸着刀柄，用手指在边缘摩挲着。触摸这个物体所获得的真实感并没有确认卡罗尔这个人的存在，反而更像是消除了她曾经存在的事实；触摸这把刀所获得的真实感并没有唤起太多她心里对卡罗尔的感觉，不如她们两人从来没有一起聆听过的乐曲更能让她想念着卡罗尔。她一面想着卡罗尔，心里还糅杂着一股扭曲的厌恶感，卡罗尔就好像是沉默又平静的遥远之地。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Therese went to the basin to wash her face in cold water. She should get a job, tomorrow if she could. That had been her idea in stopping here, to work for two weeks or so, not to weep in hotel rooms. She should send Mrs. Cooper the hotel name as an address, simply for courtesy's sake. It was another of the things she must do, although she did not want to. And was it worth while to write to Harkevy again, she wondered, after his polite but explicit note in Sioux Falls. "… I should be glad to see you again when you come to New York, but it is impossible for me to promise anything this spring. It would be a good idea for you to see Mr. Ned Bernstein, the co-producer, when you get back. He can tell you more of what is happening in designing studios than I can…" No, she wouldn't write again about that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特芮丝走到洗手台用冷水洗脸。如果可以的话，她隔天就该找份工作上班了。她想要留在这个地方，工作两个礼拜左右，不要光躲在饭店里面哭泣。她也该写信给库柏太太，告诉她这个饭店的名字，只是单纯出于礼貌，纵使她不想，也必须这样做。她在苏族瀑布收到哈凯维的来信，内容礼貌而含蓄，她思索着自己是否应该再度写信给他。“……你回到纽约后，我很乐意再度与你相见，但今年我暂时不能给你任何承诺。不过等你回来后，倒可以考虑去见见联合制作人奈德·柏恩斯坦先生。他或许更有资格告诉你目前在剧场设计圈子里的情况……”算了，她不会再为了那件事写信了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Downstairs, she bought a picture post card of Lake Michigan, and deliberately wrote a cheerful message on it to Mrs. Robichek. It seemed false as she wrote it, but walking away from the box where she had dropped it, she was conscious suddenly of the energy in her body, the spring in her toes, the youth in her blood that warmed her cheeks as she walked faster, and she knew she was free and blessed compared to Mrs. Robichek, and what she had written was not false, because she could so well afford it. She was not crumpled or half blind, not in pain. She stood by a store window and quickly put on some more lipstick. A gust of wind made her step to catch her balance. But she could feel in the wind's coldness its core of spring, like a heart warm and young inside it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在楼下，她买了一张密歇根湖的风景明信片，刻意在上面写些愉快的讯息，寄给罗比谢克太太。她写这些讯息的时候，也明白它们看起来很虚伪，等她把明信片投进邮筒之后，突然感到身体精力旺盛，脚趾几乎都在跳跃着，迈步快走的时候血液里充满了活力，温暖了她的脸颊。她知道，自己和罗比谢克太太比起来要自由多了，有福气多了，她笔下写出的东西其实并不虚假，因为她拥有着这一切，她没有一蹶不振，也没有视力半盲，也没有感到痛楚。她站在一家店的橱窗边，很快补好了口红。一阵风吹来，她停住脚步让自己站稳。但在这阵冷风中，她可以感觉到春天的内核，就像一颗内在温暖又年轻的心脏一样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Tomorrow morning, she would start to look for a job. She should be able to live on the money she had left, and save whatever she earned to get back to New York on. She could wire her bank for the rest of her money, of course, but that was not what she wanted. She wanted two weeks of working among people she didn't know, doing the kind of work a million other people did. She wanted to step into someone else's shoes.</div>

<div class="line_en">Therese didn't. The school had taught her typing, but not shorthand, so she was out.</div>

<div class="line_en">She looked through the help-wanted columns again that afternoon. Then she remembered the sign on the fence of the lumberyard not far from the hotel. "Girl wanted for general office work and stock. $40 weekly." If they didn't demand shorthand, she might qualify. It was around three when she turned into the windy street where the lumberyard lay. She lifted her head and let the wind blow her hair back from her face. And she remembered Carol saying, I like to see you walking. When I see you from a distance, I feel you're walking on the palm of my hand and you're about five inches high. She could hear Carol's soft voice under the babble of the wind, and she grew tense, with bitterness and fear. She walked faster, ran a few steps, as if she could run out of that morass of love and hate and resentment in which her mind suddenly floundered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天下午她再度看遍征人启事栏，然后想起距离饭店不远的锯木工厂外墙上贴了个招牌：“征女性，担任办公室行政及存货管理。一周四十元。”如果他们没有要求速记，她也许能胜任。她走到锯木厂边强风吹过的街道时已是下午三点了。她抬着头，让风把她的头发从脸上往后吹，想起卡罗尔说过，我喜欢看你走路的样子，远远看到你的时候，我觉得你好像只有五英寸高，就走在我的手掌上面。在风声的呢喃中，她听见卡罗尔柔软的声音，却变得紧张起来，还掺杂着苦涩与恐惧。她走得更快了，还跑了几步，仿佛这样就可以跑离爱情、憎恨与厌恶的困境。在这样的困境中，她的思绪慌乱了起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She answered an advertisement for a receptionist-filing clerk that said little typing required and call in person.

<div class="line_en">There was a wooden shack of an office at the side of the lumberyard. She went in and spoke with a Mr. Zambrowski, a slow moving baldheaded man with a gold watch chain that barely stretched across his front. Before Therese asked him about shorthand, he volunteered that he didn't need it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="锯木厂的一角有个小小的木头办公室，她走进去，见到了赞布洛斯基先生。他是个动作很慢的秃头男人，戴着一只金色怀表，表链横越他的身体正面。特芮丝还没问他应试者是否需要具备速记技能，他就主动说这里不需要这项技能。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He said he would try her out the rest of the afternoon and tomorrow. Two other girls came in for the job the next morning, and Mr. Zambrowski took their names, but before noon, he said the job was hers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他还说，今天下午和隔天就是试用期。隔天有另外两个女孩进来应征，赞布洛斯基先生也记下了她们的名字，但是隔天还不到中午，他就告诉特芮丝说，这份工作是她的了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Her hours were from eight to four thirty, and her duties consisted simply in checking the mill shipments to the yard against the orders received, and in writing letters of confirmation. She did not see much lumber from her desk in the office, but the smell of it was in the air, fresh as if the saws had just exposed the surface of the white pine boards, and she could hear it bouncing and rattling as the trucks pulled into the center of the yard. She liked the work, liked Mr. Zambrowski, and liked the lumberjacks and truck drivers who came into the office to warm their hands at the fire. One of the lumberjacks named Steve, an attractive young man with a golden stubble of beard, invited her a couple of times to have lunch with him in the cafeteria down the street. He asked her for a date on Saturday night, but Therese did not want to spend a whole evening with him or with anyone yet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她的工作时间是八点到四点半，工作内容只是检查伐木场送到这里的货品和他们的订货单是否相符，然后写信确认。她从办公桌边看不到什么木材，但空气里一直飘着木材的味道，仿佛锯子才刚切开白色松木板的表面。她也可以听到卡车开进锯木厂时，木材跳动、摩擦的声音。她很喜欢这份工作，喜欢赞布洛斯基先生，也喜欢跑来办公室火炉旁边暖手的伐木工人和卡车司机。有个伐木工人叫史蒂夫，是个很有吸引力的年轻人，蓄着金色的胡茬，好几次邀她到街上的餐厅吃午餐，也邀她礼拜六晚上跟他约会，但特芮丝不希望整个晚上都跟他或其他任何人在一起。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Two days later, a letter arrived from Abby enclosing a personal check for a hundred and fifty dollars that Abby told her to "forget about." Abby said she had spoken with Carol, and that Carol would like to hear from her, and she gave Carol's address. It was a rather cold letter, but the gesture of the check was not cold. It hadn't been prompted by Carol, Therese knew.</div>

<div class="line_en">She looked at Carol's letter opener on the bed table, and now it meant Carol, the person of flesh and blood, the Carol with freckles and the corner nicked off one tooth. Did she owe Carol anything, Carol the person? Hadn't Carol been playing with her, as Richard had said? She remembered Carol's words, "When you have a husband and child it's a little different." She frowned at the letter opener, not understanding why it had become only a letter opener suddenly, why it was a matter of indifference to her whether she kept it or threw it away.</div>

And about the Carol who was not a picture, but a woman with a child and a husband, with freckles on her hands and a habit of cursing, of growing melancholy at unexpected moments, with a bad habit of indulging her will. A woman who had endured much more in New York than she had in South Dakota. She looked at Dannie's eyes, at his chin with the faint cleft. She knew that up to now she had been under a spell that prevented her from seeing anyone in the world but Carol.</div>
