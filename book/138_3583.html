<div class="line_cn" title="他随即叙述了下文的经过：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One evening last winter I suddenly felt overcome by that overpowering sense of misery and languor that takes possession of one from time to time. I was in my own apartment, all alone, and I was convinced that if I gave in to my feelings I should have a terrible attack of melancholia, one of those attacks that lead to suicide when they recur too often.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="去年冬天里的某天晚上，我忽然感到一阵使人凄凉的懒散意味，那是教人受不住的，不时缠住人的肉体和性灵。我当时独自一个儿待在家里，觉得自己倘若那么待着不动，立刻就会感到过分的愁惨，那类愁惨倘若时常侵袭过来，每每无可避免地把人引上自杀之路。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I put on my overcoat and went out without the slightest idea of what I was going to do. Having gone as far as the boulevards, I began to wander along by the almost empty cafes. It was raining, a fine rain that affects your mind as it does your clothing, not one of those good downpours which come down in torrents, driving breathless passers-by into doorways, but a rain without drops that deposits on your clothing an imperceptible spray and soon covers you with a sort of iced foam that chills you through.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我披上了外套，随即出了街，自己却不知道去干些什么。由下坡道儿走到了城中心的热闹大街，我开始沿着各处咖啡馆的门外闲逛，咖啡馆几乎全是空的，原因是天正下雨，那种细雨，同时沾湿人的精神和衣服，并不是倾盆大雨，不像瀑布似地倒下来叫呼吸迫促的行人跑到大房子的门底下躲藏，而是一种使人无从辨别点滴的毛毛细雨，一种不断地把那种无从目睹的纤小点滴对人飘过来，不久就在衣服上盖着一层冰凉而有渗透力的苔藓样的水分。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">What should I do? I walked in one direction and then came back, looking for some place where I could spend two hours, and discovering for the first time that there is no place of amusement in Paris in the evening. At last I decided to go to the Folies-Bergere, that entertaining resort for gay women.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="怎么办？我向前走，我又向后退回来，想找一个消磨两小时的地方，结果却第一次发现夜晚在巴黎竟没有什么好散心的。最后，我决定走进了牧女狂，那个算得是姑娘们的游戏场。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I thought to myself that, in truth, not one of those languid creatures, greasy rather than fat, puffed out here and thin there, with the contour of a monk and the lower extremities of a bow-legged snipe, was worth the louis that they would get with great difficulty after asking five.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我暗自说那些婆娘都是畸形的，与其说她们富于脂肪不如说她们全是油垢，这一部分肥得凸出来，另一部分却又干瘦，腆着一个“酒肉和尚”式的大肚子，而两条鹭鸶式的长腿的膝盖部分却又向里弯曲，所以真地没有一个是值得一枚鲁意的，她们在讨价五枚鲁意以后好不容易才能够得到那么一枚。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There were very few people in the main hall. In the long horseshoe curve there were only a few ordinary looking people, whose plebeian origin was apparent in their manners, their clothes, the cut of their hair and beard, their hats, their complexion. It was rarely that one saw from time to time a man whom you suspected of having washed himself thoroughly, and his whole make-up seemed to match. As for the women, they were always the same, those frightful women you all know, ugly, tired looking, drooping, and walking along in their lackadaisical manner, with that air of foolish superciliousness which they assume, I do not know why.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在它的大厅子里，人并不多。那条蹄铁形散步长廊只容纳着一些低级的游客，他们的平凡身世从举动上，从服装上，从须发剪裁上，从帽子上，从皮肤的色泽上显示得一目了然。至于一个可以看做是干干净净洗濯过的人，穿着整套像是相称的服装的，那真的不大遇得见。至于姑娘们呢，始终是同样那么些个，你们知道的那些可怕的姑娘们，容颜丑陋，精神疲乏，皮肤松驰，显出她们那种不知因何而起的愚顽的轻蔑态度，她们走来走去，好像在猎取主顾似的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="她在四楼停住了，关好了和外面相通的门以后，她问道：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But all at once I saw a little creature whom I thought attractive, not in her first youth, but fresh, comical and tantalizing. I stopped her, and stupidly, without thinking, I made an appointment with her for that night. I did not want to go back to my own home alone, all alone; I preferred the company and the caresses of this hussy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过我忽然望见一个使我觉得可爱的矮矮的人儿了，年纪并不很轻，不过是鲜润的，颇讨人欢喜的，有刺激性的。我拦住了她，并且愚笨地不待考虑，就出了我肯付的那种度过通宵的代价。我不愿意孤孤单单独自一个人回家；更欢喜同着这一个姑娘去偎傍搂抱。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And I followed her. She lived in a great big house in the Rue des Martyrs. The gas was already extinguished on the stairway. I ascended the steps slowly, lighting a candle match every few seconds, stubbing my foot against the steps, stumbling and angry as I followed the rustle of the skirt ahead of me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是我跟着她走了。她住在殉教街一所大房子里。楼梯上的煤气灯已经熄了。我慢慢地爬上去，不断地划燃一枝蜡烛火柴，我的脚撞着梯级几乎快要失足，因此心里不大痛快，她走在头里，我听见她的衣裙的摩察声音。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Then you will stay till to-morrow?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那么你可是待到明天？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And she left me in the darkness. I heard her shutting two doors and then I thought I heard her talking. I was surprised and uneasy. The thought that she had a protector staggered me. But I have good fists and a solid back. "We shall see," I said to myself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是她让我站在黑暗当中了。我听见她关好了两扇门，随后她仿佛还说了几句话。我诧异起来，不放心了。想来或许有一个面首在她屋子里。不过我的拳头和腰干儿都是结实的。我暗自想起：“等会儿，我们可以看个明白。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="她用你字来称呼我，就是表示一种占有权的取得。我进去了，经过了一间显然从来没有人吃饭的饭厅以后，我就走进了一间卧房，那正是一般姑娘们住的卧房，连家具出租的卧房，还带着几幅厚的幔子和一铺染上可疑的斑斑点点的红绸子羽绒被盖。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I listened attentively with ear and mind. Some one was stirring about, walking quietly and very carefully. Then another door was opened and I thought I again heard some one talking, but in a very low tone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我用全副精神和耳力去细听。有人轻轻动作，有人慢慢行走，并且非常之小心谨慎。随后另外一扇门打开了，我觉得又有人说话，不过很低很低。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="她很快地脱了衣衫，快得在我脱下外套以前，她已经到了床上。她开始笑了：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Five minutes later I longed to put on my things and get away. But this terrible languor that had overcome me at home took possession of me again, and deprived me of energy enough to move and I stayed in spite of the disgust that I felt for this association. The unusual attractiveness that I supposed I had discovered in this creature over there under the chandeliers of the theater had altogether vanished on closer acquaintance, and she was nothing more to me now than a common woman, like all the others, whose indifferent and complaisant kiss smacked of garlic.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="五分钟以后，我发痴似地很想穿上衣裳并且走开。但是，那种在我家里缠过我的使人疲劳的懒散意味竟留住了我，剥夺了我任何动作的气力，所以尽管我在这个人人可睡的床上感到恶心，我仍旧躺着不走。从前，我在那边，我在游戏场的灯光下面，以为从这个尤物身上发现了肉感滋味，而现在，那滋味竟在我的怀抱中间消失了，靠着我肉贴肉的，不过是个庸俗姑娘，和一般的庸俗姑娘丝毫没有两样，而且她那种并无感情却像殷勤的吻又带着一股大蒜味儿。">查看中文翻译</div>

Driven by the stupid curiosity that prompts all men to question these creatures about their first experiences, to attempt to lift the veil of their first folly, as though to find in them a trace of pristine innocence, to love them, possibly, in a fleeting memory of their candor and modesty of former days, evoked by a word, I insistently asked her about her earlier lovers.</div>
