<div class="line_en">What I really needed was a good climb in my sycamore tree, but I settled for watering the lawn while I tried to think of other things. I cranked open the spigot and admired how rich and black the dirt looked as I sprinkled back and forth across the soil. And I was busy talking to my buried seedlings, coaxing them to spring up and greet the rising sun, when my father came outside.</div>

<div class="line_en">Maybe it was all how you looked at it. Maybe there were things I saw as ugly that other people thought were beautiful.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="也许这只是你看的方式。也许还有很多我看见丑陋的东西别人认为很美丽。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Like Shelly Stalls. A perfect example! To me there was absolutely nothing to recommend her, but the rest of the world seemed to think she was the cat's meow. Me-ow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="比如雪莉·斯塔尔斯。一个完美的例子！对我来说她没有任何值得赞许的地方，但剩下的世界似乎认为她是温顺的小猫。喵！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So I hurried over. She pointed through the column of books and whispered, "Listen!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所以我快速走过去。她指着一排书然后低语道：“听着！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Darla was in a few of my classes, but we weren't really friends, so I looked behind me to see who else she might be flagging.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="达拉和我上了一些课，但我们不是真正的朋友，所以我看着我后面她可能在对什么人招手。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Anyway, I sort of drifted through the week like that. Until Thursday. Thursday our social studies class went to the library to do research for our famous historical figure report. I'd chosen Susan B. Anthony and her fight for the right to vote, and I was in the middle of tracking down some books when Darla Tressler flagged me from the end of a stack.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无论如何，我差不多就那样度过了整周。直到星期四。周四我们的社会学习课去了图书馆搜索我们最著名的历史人物报告。我选择了苏珊·布朗内尔·安东尼，还有她为正确选举的斗争，我正查找着一本书的中途，达拉·特雷斯勒在最后一排书架朝我招手。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Come here!" she mouthed, frantically waving me over.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“过来！”她对我做口型，紧张地招手让我过去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was Garrett's voice. And then Bryce's. And they were talking about… me. About my chickens. And salmonella poisoning. And how Bryce had been throwing away my eggs. And about me fixing up our yard.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="是加瑞特的声音。然后是布莱斯。而且他们在讨论…我。关于我的鸡。还有沙门氏菌中毒。而布莱斯是怎样扔掉我的蛋的。还有我整理我们的院子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And then Garrett laughed and said, "A retard? Well, that explains a lot, doesn't it? You know… about Juli?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="之后加瑞特大笑着说：“一个智障？嗯，那就好解释了，是吗？你知道…关于朱莉？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Bryce was sounding like he felt really bad, but then suddenly my blood ran cold. He was talking about David!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布莱斯听起来感觉很差，但之后突然间我的血液都变凉了。他在讲关于大卫的事！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I positively crumbled onto the floor. And in a flash the voices were gone. Darla checked around the corner, then sat beside me, saying, "Oh, Jules, I'm so, so sorry. I thought he was about to confess that he's been crushing on you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我直接跌在了地板上。只一瞬间那些声音就消失了。达拉检查了下角落，然后坐在我边上，“哦，朱莉，我非常，非常抱歉。我还以为他要承认他迷上你了呢。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For a second, there was silence. And at that moment I was sure they must be able to hear my heart pounding in my chest, but then Bryce laughed and said, "Oh, right."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有几秒种，那里鸦雀无声。而那一瞬间我很肯定他们都能听见我的心在胸膛里扑通直跳，但之后布莱斯笑着说道：“哦，没错。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What? Darla, Bryce does not have a crush on me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“什么？达拉，布莱斯没有迷上我。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Where have you been? Haven't you noticed the way he's been looking at you? That boy is lost in Loveland."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你在说什么呢？你难道没注意他看着你的样子吗？那小子爱上你了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, obviously! You just heard him, Darla!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，很明显！你刚才听见了，达拉！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Darla, the way things have been going, I wouldn't be surprised if there was a bee in my hair."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“达拉，以这些事发生的方式来看，我并不会惊讶如果我的头发里真的有蜜蜂。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yeah, but yesterday, yesterday I caught him staring at you and he said there was a bee in your hair. A bee, girl. Is that the lamest cover-up you've ever heard or what?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是啊，但是昨天，昨天我发现他偷瞄你，他说是因为你头发上有只蜜蜂。一只蜜蜂，女孩。这借口简直太傻了！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was what Bryce and Garrett had said that I couldn't forget. How could they be so cruel? And so stupid? Is this what my father had gone through growing up?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我不能忘记的是布莱斯和加瑞特说的。他们怎么能这么残忍？这么愚蠢？这难道是我爸爸长大的方式吗？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, you think you're that sweet, huh? Just attract bees like honey? Well, honey, the only bee you're attracting around here is B-r-y-c-e. Cute, yeah. But after what I just heard, I'd stomp and grind, girl. Stomp and grind." She got up to go but turned and said, "Don't worry. I won't jabber."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，你认为你真有那么甜吗？就像蜜一样吸引蜜蜂？嗯，亲爱的，你吸引的只是布莱斯而已。很可爱，是的。但是听到这些之后，我会把这种想法踩在脚下，女孩。踩碎了。”她站起来要走，但转了个身说道：“别担心，我不会说的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The more I thought about it, the angrier I got. What right did Bryce have to make fun of my uncle? How dare he!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我越想越生气。布莱斯有什么资格嘲笑我的叔叔？他怎么敢！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I stormed back to the section of books on Susan B. Anthony, found two that would work, and then went back to my table. But as I was collecting my things to check out of the library, I remembered. The next day we were going to the Loskis' house for dinner.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我闯进图书关于苏珊·布朗内尔·安东尼的章节，找到了两条有用信息，然后回答了我的桌子。但我整理着我的东西出图书馆的时候，我想起来了。第二天我们要去洛世奇家吃饭。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I felt fire burn in my cheeks and a cold, hard knot tighten in my heart. And in a flash I knew -- I was through with Bryce Loski. He could keep his brilliant blue eyes. He could keep his two-faced smile and… and my kiss. That's right! He could keep that, too. I was never, ever going to talk to him again!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我感觉到火在烧我的脸颊，而一个冰冷的，坚固的结系在了我心里。一瞬间我知道了——我和布莱斯结束了。他可以保留他闪光的蓝眼睛。他可以保留他两面派的微笑和…和我的吻。没错！他也能保留这个。我永远，永远都不会再和他讲话！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I just shook my head and forgot about Darla. How wrong could a person be.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我只是摇了摇头然后忘了达拉。一个人能够多么错误呢。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Didn't I?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不是吗？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I zipped up my backpack and threw it on my shoulder. Surely after what had happened, I had the right to vote against going!</div>
