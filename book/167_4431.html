<div class="line_en">Her head felt lumpy when she touched it. When Yoren had dragged her into that alley she'd thought he meant to kill her, but the sour old man had only held her tight, sawing through her mats and tangles with his dagger. She remembered how the breeze sent the fistfuls of dirty brown hair skittering across the paving stones, toward the sept where her father had died. "I'm taking men and boys from the city," Yoren growled as the sharp steel scraped at her head. "Now you hold still, boy." By the time he had finished, her scalp was nothing but tufts and stubble.</div>

<div class="line_en">Afterward he told her that from there to Winterfell she'd be Arry the orphan boy. "Gate shouldn't be hard, but the road's another matter. You got a long way to go in bad company. I got thirty this time, men and boys all bound for the Wall, and don't be thinking they're like that bastard brother o' yours." He shook her. "Lord Eddard gave me pick o' the dungeons, and I didn't find no little lordlings down there. This lot, half o' them would turn you over to the queen quick as spit for a pardon and maybe a few silvers. The other half'd do the same, only they'd rape you first. So you keep to yourself and make your water in the woods, alone. That'll be the hardest part, the pissing, so don't drink no more'n you need."</div>

<div class="line_en">Leaving King's Landing was easy, just like he'd said. The Lannister guardsmen on the gate were stopping everyone, but Yoren called one by name and their wagons were waved through. No one spared Arya a glance. They were looking for a highborn girl, daughter of the King's Hand, not for a skinny boy with his hair chopped off. Arya never looked back. She wished the Rush would rise and wash the whole city away, Flea Bottom and the Red Keep and the Great Sept and everything, and everyone too, especially Prince Joffrey and his mother. But she knew it wouldn't, and anyhow Sansa was still in the city and would wash away too. When she remembered that, Arya decided to wish for Winterfell instead.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如他所说，离开君临果真不难。守在城门口的兰尼斯特士兵把每个人都拦下来盘查，但尤伦跟其中一个打声招呼，他们便挥手让马车过去了。根本没有人正眼瞧艾莉亚一下。他们要找的是出身高贵的首相千金，而非骨瘦如柴、头发剃光的小男孩。艾莉亚没有回头，她好希望黑水湾洪水暴涨，冲走全城，把跳蚤窝、红堡和大圣堂通通冲走，把里面的人也全部冲走，尤其是乔佛里王子和他母亲。但她心里知道这是不可能的，更何况珊莎还在城里，要是被冲走怎么办？想到这里，艾莉亚便决定专心想临冬城就好了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Yoren was wrong about the pissing, though. That wasn't the hardest part at all; Lommy Greenhands and Hot Pie were the hardest part. Orphan boys. Yoren had plucked some from the streets with promises of food for their bellies and shoes for their feet. The rest he'd found in chains. "The Watch needs good men," he told them as they set out, "but you lot will have to do."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是，尤伦也弄错了一点，入厕并不是最麻烦的，最麻烦的是绿手罗米和热派。他俩都是孤儿，尤伦在大街上找了好些个孤儿，因为他向他们保证加入守夜人就能填饱肚子，还有鞋子可穿。其余的人是囚犯。“守夜人需要的是有能力的人，”出发时他对他们说，“既然只有你们这种货色，也只好将就将就。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They took five wagons out of King's Landing, laden with supplies for the Wall: hides and bolts of cloth, bars of pig iron, a cage of ravens, books and paper and ink, a bale of sourleaf, jars of oil, and chests of medicine and spices. Teams of plow horses pulled the wagons, and Yoren had bought two coursers and a half-dozen donkeys for the boys. Arya would have preferred a real horse, but the donkey was better than riding on a wagon.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们驾着五部马车从君临出发，车上装满长城所需的补给品：兽皮和布匹，生铁条，一笼信鸦，纸墨书籍，一捆酸草叶，大批油罐，以及成箱的药品和香料。几队的犁马负责拉车，尤伦还买来两匹战马，以及五六头驴子给男孩子骑。艾莉亚骑不到马，不过骑驴子总比坐马车好得多。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The men paid her no mind, but she was not so lucky with the boys. She was two years younger than the youngest orphan, not to mention smaller and skinnier, and Lommy and Hot Pie took her silence to mean she was scared, or stupid, or deaf. "Look at that sword Lumpyhead's got there," Lommy said one morning as they made their plodding way past orchards and wheat fields. He'd been a dyer's apprentice before he was caught stealing, and his arms were mottled green to the elbow. When he laughed he brayed like the donkeys they were riding. "Where's a gutter rat like Lumpyhead get him a sword?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="成年人对她不理不睬，但她和其他男孩相处时就没这么好运了。她比里面年纪最小的孤儿还要小两岁，更别提她长得又瘦又小。罗米和热派把她的沉默解读为害怕、蠢笨，甚至当她是聋子。“你们瞧癞痢头身上那把剑，”有天早上，当他们缓步穿越果园和麦田时，罗米突然这么说。他因偷窃被捕之前，原本是个染匠的学徒，两手直到肘部都是绿的。他们笑起来跟驴叫差不多。“我说癞痢头这种阴沟鼠哪儿来的剑啊？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Yoren had taken grown men from the dungeons as well, thieves and poachers and rapers and the like. The worst were the three he'd found in the black cells who must have scared even him, because he kept them fettered hand and foot in the back of a wagon, and vowed they'd stay in irons all the way to the Wall. One had no nose, only the hole in his face where it had been cut off, and the gross fat bald one with the pointed teeth and the weeping sores on his cheeks had eyes like nothing human.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尤伦从地牢里找来的那些囚犯几乎都是成人，有小偷、盗猎者和强奸犯等等。其中有三个是从黑牢里挖出来的，大概连他都怕，因为他把他们手脚全铐住，关在马车上，并发誓直到抵达长城为止，都不会放他们出来。其中一个没了鼻子，脸上只剩一个凹洞；另一个是肥胖的光头，牙齿尖利，脸上生满流脓面疱，眼神非人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Leave him be," said the boy with the shaggy black hair who rode behind them. Lommy had named him the Bull, on account of this horned helm he had that he polished all the time but never wore. Lommy didn't dare mock the Bull. He was older, and big for his age, with a broad chest and strong-looking arms.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你们不要欺负他。”这时那个一头粗乱黑发，骑在后面的男孩发了话。罗米给他起了个绰号叫“大牛”，因为他成天擦拭一个牛角头盔，却从来不戴。不过罗米可不敢惹大牛，因为他不仅年纪较长，生得又特别结实，胸膛宽厚，手臂强壮。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Yes I do, Arya could have said. I killed a boy, a fat boy like you, I stabbed him in the belly and he died, and I'll kill you too if you don't let me alone. Only she did not dare. Yoren didn't know about the stableboy, but she was afraid of what he might do if he found out.

<div class="line_cn" title="我当然会用！艾莉亚想说，我用它杀了一个像你一样的胖小子，一剑戳进他的肚子，他当场就死了，你要是再来惹我，我把你也杀了。然而她不敢这么说，尤伦不知道马僮被杀的事，她很怕他知道后会怎么做。艾莉亚很确定这群人里面一定有杀人犯，至少那三个被铐起来的铁定杀过人。但话说回来，太后又没有搜捕他们，所以那不一样啦。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Arya made the stick whistle as she laid the wood across his donkey's hindquarters. The animal hawed and bucked, dumping Hot Pie on the ground. She vaulted off her own donkey and poked him in the gut as he tried to get up and he sat back down with a grunt. Then she whacked him across the face and his nose made a crack like a branch breaking. Blood dribbled from his nostrils. When Hot Pie began to wail, Arya whirled toward Lommy Greenhands, who was sitting on his donkey openmouthed. "You want some sword too?" she yelled, but he didn't. He raised dyed green hands in front of his face and squealed at her to get away.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Bull shouted, "Behind you," and Arya spun. Hot Pie was on his knees, his fist closing around a big jagged rock. She let him throw it, ducking her head as it sailed past. Then she flew at him. He raised a hand and she hit it, and then his cheek, and then his knee. He grabbed for her, and she danced aside and bounced the wood off the back of his head. He fell down and got up and stumbled after her, his red face all smeared with dirt and blood. Arya slid into a water dancer's stance and waited. When he came close enough, she lunged, right between his legs, so hard that if her wooden sword had had a point it would have come out between his butt cheeks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时大牛喊道：“小心后面！”艾莉亚连忙转身，热派已经站了起来，手中握着一颗锐利的大石头。她等他出手，身子一低，石头便从头上飞过，接着她便朝他冲去。他举手，她便打手，接着是脸颊，膝盖。他伸手抓她，但她闪到旁边，举起棍朝他后脑勺敲了下去。他仆倒在地，随即又爬起身，踉跄地追过来，涨红的脸上全是鲜血和污泥。艾莉亚摆出水舞者的姿势，等他靠近之后，猛地往前一刺，正中他双腿之间。用力之重，她相信若是用真剑，大概会从他屁眼中间穿出去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">By the time Yoren pulled her off him, Hot Pie was sprawled out on the ground with his breeches brown and smelly, crying as Arya whapped him over and over and over. "Enough," the black brother roared, prying the stick sword from her fingers, "you want to kill the fool?" When Lommy and some others started to squeal, the old man turned on them too. "Shut your mouths, or I'll be shutting them for you. Any more o' this, I'll tie you lot behind the wagons and drag you to the Wall." He spat. "And that goes twice for you, Arry.

<div class="line_en">I won't, Arya thought stubbornly, but when Yoren laid the wood against the back of her bare thighs, the shriek burst out of her anyway. "Think that hurt?" he said. "Try this one." The stick came whistling. Arya shrieked again, clutching the tree to keep from falling. "One more." She held on tight, chewing her lip, flinching when she heard it coming. The stroke made her jump and howl. I won't cry, she thought, I won't do that. I'm a Stark of Winterfell, our sigil is the direwolf, direwolves don't cry. She could feel a thin trickle of blood running down her left leg. Her thighs and cheeks were ablaze with pain. "Might be I got your attention now," Yoren said.

Lord Eddard's to take the black, he says to me, wait, he'll be going with you. Why d'you think I was there? Only something went queer."</div>

<div class="line_en">That night she lay upon her thin blanket on the hard ground, staring up at the great red comet. The comet was splendid and scary all at once. "The Red Sword," the Bull named it; he claimed it looked like a sword, the blade still red-hot from the forge. When Arya squinted the right way she could see the sword too, only it wasn't a new sword, it was Ice, her father's greatsword, all ripply Valyrian steel, and the red was Lord Eddard's blood on the blade after Ser Ilyn the King's Justice had cut off his head. Yoren had made her look away when it happened, yet it seemed to her that the comet looked like Ice must have, after.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当晚，她在硬土地上铺了薄毯子，望着天际的大红彗星。彗星虽然漂亮，却也很吓人。大牛把彗星叫做“红剑”，因为他说看起来像一把刚从锻炉里取出来的火红宝剑。艾莉亚歪歪头，看出了剑的形状，但她看到的不是新打好的剑，而是父亲那把瓦雷利亚巨剑，泛着波纹的寒冰，剑带血红，正是艾德公爵被御前执法官伊林爵士斩首示众后流下的鲜血。事情发生时尤伦不准她看，可在她想来，父亲死后的寒冰就是彗星这个样子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It did help, some, though the taste of it was foul and it made her spit look like blood. Even so, she walked for the rest of that day, and the day after, and the day after that, too raw to sit a donkey. Hot Pie was worse off; Yoren had to shift some barrels around so he could lie in the back of a wagon on some sacks of barley, and he whimpered every time the wheels hit a rock. Lommy Greenhands wasn't even hurt, yet he stayed as far away from Arya as he could get. "Every time you look at him, he twitches," the Bull told her as she walked beside his donkey. She did not answer. It seemed safer not to talk to anyone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="酸草叶的确管点用，可是嚼起来十分恶心，而且把她的唾沫变得像血一样。即便如此，那天接下来她还是只能走路，第二天也一样，再过去那天也是，因为大腿实在痛得没法骑驴子。热派的情形更惨，尤伦得挪动好些木桶，腾出车上的空间，好让他躺在一袋袋的麦子上，只要车轮碰上石头，他就开始呜咽。绿手罗米根本没事，但他却躲着艾莉亚，躲得远远的。“每次你一看他，他就全身发抖喔。”大牛告诉她。她走在他的驴子旁边，听了没吭声，看来还是别跟人说话比较安全。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When at last she slept, she dreamed of home. The kingsroad wound its way past Winterfell on its way to the Wall, and Yoren had promised he'd leave her there with no one any wiser about who she'd been. She yearned to see her mother again, and Robb and Bran and Rickon… but it was Jon Snow she thought of most. She wished somehow they could come to the Wall before Winterfell, so Jon might muss up her hair and call her "little sister." She'd tell him, "I missed you," and he'd say it too at the very same moment, the way they always used to say things together. She would have liked that. She would have liked that better than anything.</div>
