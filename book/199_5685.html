<div class="line_en">The prospect of talking face-to-face with Sirius was all that sustained Harry over the next fortnight, the only bright spot on a horizon that had never looked darker. The shock of finding himself school champion had worn off slightly now, and the fear of what was facing him had started to sink in. The first task was drawing steadily nearer; he felt as though it were crouching ahead of him hike some horrific monster, barring his path. He had never suffered nerves like these; they were way beyond anything he had experienced before a Quidditch match, not even his last one against Slytherin, which had decided who would win the Quidditch Cup. Harry was finding it hard to think about the future at all; he felt as though his whole life had been heading up to, and would finish with, the first task…</div>

<div class="line_en">Admittedly, he didn't see how Sirius was going to make him feel any better about having to perform an unknown piece of difficult and dangerous magic in front of hundreds of people, but the mere sight of a friendly face would be something at the moment. Harry wrote back to Sirius saying that he would be beside the common room fire at the time Sirius had suggested; and he and Hermione spent a long time going over plans for forcing any stragglers out of the common room on the night in question. If the worst came to the worst, they were going to drop a bag of Dungbombs, but they hoped they wouldn't have to resort to that -- Filch would skin them alive.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他也承认，小天狼星不可能使他情绪好转多少，因为他必须当着几百个人的面完成一项未知的、危险的、难度极大的魔法活动，可是在目前这种情况下，能见到一张友好的面孔也是莫大的安慰啊。哈利给小天狼星写了回信，说他将在小天狼星提议的时间守在公共休息室的炉火边。他和赫敏花了很长时间，反复研究那天夜里怎样把逗留在公共休息室里的人都赶出去，设想了好多计划。如果到时候实在没有办法，他们就准备扔出一包粪蛋，但他们希望用不着使出这一招——费尔奇会活剥了他们的皮！">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The article had appeared ten days ago, and Harry still got a sick, burning feeling of shame in his stomach every time he thought about it.

<div class="line_en">I suppose I get my strength from my parents. I know they'd be very proud of me if they could see me now… Yes, sometimes at night I still cry about them, I'm not ashamed to admit it… I know nothing will hurt me during the tournament, because they're watching over me…</div>

<div class="line_en">In the meantime, life became even worse for Harry within the confines of the castle, for Rita Skeeter had published her piece about the Triwizard Tournament, and it had turned out to be not so much a report on the tournament as a highly colored life story of Harry. Much of the front page had been given over to a picture of Harry; the article (continuing on pages two, six, and seven) had been all about Harry, the names of the Beauxbatons and Durmstrang champions (misspelled) had been squashed into the last line of the article, and Cedric hadn't been mentioned at all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="与此同时，哈利在城堡内的生活变得更加糟糕，因为丽塔·斯基特那篇关于三强争霸赛的文章发表了。这篇文章与其说是对争霸赛情况的报道，倒不好说是对哈利个人生活的添油加醋的描绘。报纸第一版的大量版面都被哈利的一张照片占据了，整篇文章（待续至第二、第六和第七版）讲的都是哈利，布斯巴顿和德姆斯特朗勇士的名字被挤在文章的最后一行，而且还拼错了，对塞德里克则只字未提。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The back of Hagrid's enormous shaggy head -- he had mercifully abandoned his bunches -- emerged over the crowd. Harry wondered why he hadn't spotted him at once, as Hagrid was so large, but standing up carefully, he saw that Hagrid had been leaning low, talking to Professor Moody. Hagrid had his usual enormous tankard in front of him, but Moody was drinking from his hip flask. Madam Rosmerta, the pretty landlady, didn't seem to think much of this; she was looking askance at Moody as she collected glasses from tables around them. Perhaps she thought it was an insult to her mulled mead, but Harry knew better. Moody had told them all during their last Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson that he preferred to prepare his own food and drink at all times, as it was so easy for Dark wizards to poison an unattended cup.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="人群中赫然出现了海格那硕大的、头发蓬乱的后脑勺——谢天谢地，他总算不再把头发扎成马尾巴了。哈利心里纳闷，海格这么大的块头，自己刚才怎么就没有一眼看见呢。待他小心翼翼地站起身来，才发现海格正压低身子，跟穆迪教授交谈呢。海格面前放着他惯常喝的大杯啤酒，穆迪则喝着他随身携带的弧形酒瓶里的东西。漂亮的老板娘罗斯默塔夫人似乎对此很不满意，她一边收拾着旁边桌子上的玻璃杯，一边斜眼瞟着穆迪。她大概以为审对她热乎乎的蜂蜜酒的一种侮辱，但哈利知道不是这样。在他们最近一次黑魔法防御术课上，穆迪告诉过大家，他不管什么时候都宁愿自己准备食物和饮料，因为黑巫师要往一只无人看管的杯子里下毒真是太容易了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He wondered how the other champions were feeling. Every time he had seen Cedric lately, he had been surrounded by admirers and looking nervous but excited.

Quite a few people were still in there.

<div class="line_en">"-- and reading between the lines of that Skeeter woman's article last month, Moody was attacked the night before he started at Hogwarts. Yes, I know she says it was another false alarm," Sirius said hastily, seeing Harry about to speak, "but I don't think so, somehow. I think someone tried to stop him from getting to Hogwarts. I think someone knew their job would be a lot more difficult with him around. And no one's going to look into it too closely; Mad-Eye's heard intruders a bit too often. But that doesn't mean he can't still spot the real thing. Moody was the best Auror the Ministry ever had."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“——我仔细研究了那个叫斯基特的女人上个月的那篇文章，穆迪就在他到霍格沃茨就任的前一天夜里受到了攻击。是的，我知道她说这是虚惊一场，”小天狼星看到哈利想插话，赶紧补充道，“但我认为不是这样。我认为是有人试图阻止穆迪到霍格沃茨来。有人知道如果他在旁边，他们要下手就会困难得多。还有，没有人会非常认真地调查这件事，疯眼汉三天两头听见有人侵犯他。但这并不意味着真有异常情况时他不能识破。穆迪是魔法部有史以来最优秀的傲罗。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yeah, but… it's not very likely she'd have walked straight into Voldemort, is it?" said Harry.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是啊，可是…她不大可能真的撞上伏地魔吧？”哈利问。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I've been nearing some very strange things," he said slowly. "The Death Eaters seem to be a bit more active than usual lately. They showed themselves at the Quidditch World Cup, didn't they? Someone set off the Dark Mark… and then -- did you hear about that Ministry of Magic witch who's gone missing?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我听到一些非常奇怪的事情，”他语速很慢地说，“最近食死徒似乎比往常更活跃了。他们在魁地奇世界杯赛上亮相了，是不是？有人变出了黑魔标记…然后——你有没有听说过魔法部失踪的那个女巫师？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Listen, I knew Bertha Jorkins," said Sirius grimly. "She was at Hogwarts when I was, a few years above your dad and me. And she was an idiot. Very nosy, but no brains, none at all. It's not a good combination, Harry. I'd say she'd be very easy to lure into a trap."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你听我说，我认识伯莎·乔金斯。”小天狼星语气沉重地说，“当年我在霍格沃茨时，她也在这里，比你爸爸和我高几个年级。她是个傻乎乎的家伙。特别爱管闲事，可是没有头脑，完全没有头脑。这两样结合在一起可就糟糕透了，哈利。我认为她这个人经不起诱惑，很容易就中了别人的圈套。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Right -- these dragons," said Sirius, speaking very quickly now. "There's a way, Harry.

<div class="line_cn" title="“对了——那些火龙，”小天狼星说，这时他说话的速度变得很快了，“有一个绝招，哈利。不要经不起诱惑去念什么昏迷咒——火龙力大无穷，而且具有十分强大的魔力，不可能被一个昏迷咒打倒，需要六七个巫师同时念咒才能制服一条龙…”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I don't know," said Sirius slowly, "I just don't know… Karkaroff doesn't strike me as the type who'd go back to Voldemort unless he knew Voldemort was powerful enough to protect him.

<div class="line_en">Harry heard a tiny pop! in the fire behind him and knew Sirius had gone. He watched the bottom of the spiral staircase. Who had decided to go for a stroll at one o'clock in the morning, and stopped Sirius from telling him how to get past a dragon?</div>
