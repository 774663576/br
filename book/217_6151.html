<meta content="我们又弄到了挺棒的一大批各式各样的蜘蛛、屎壳郎、毛毛虫、癞蛤蟆，还有许多别的东西。我们本想弄到一个马蜂窝，后来没有弄成。那一家子正在窝里呢。我们并没有就此罢休，而是跟它们比一比耐性的劲儿，因为我们知道，在耗时间上不是它们把我们轰跑，就是我们把它们轰跑，结果是它们胜了。我们找了点草药，在给蜂子蜇过的地方擦了擦，就好得差不多了，不过坐下来的时候还不怎么灵便。于是我们去捉蛇，捉到了二三十来条花蛇和家蛇，放进了一只袋子里，随后放到了我们的房间里。这时正是吃晚饭的时间，忙忙碌碌干了一整天，肚子饿不饿呢？——哦，不，我看是不饿！等到我们回来，一看，一条蛇都不见了——我们没有把袋口扎紧，蛇就溜跑了。不过问题还不大，因为它们总还在这房子里嘛。因此我们认为，总能把一部分捉回来吧。不，有好一阵子，这间屋里可真是闹起了蛇的天下。时不时的，你能看见房椽子上等处地方突然掉下一条蛇来，往往掉到了你的菜盘子里，或是掉到了你的背上，你的脖子上，而且多半总是在你不愿见到它的时间里掉下来。说起来，这些蛇还长得挺漂亮，身上一条条花纹。这些蛇，即便是一百万条吧，也害不了人。可是在萨莉阿姨眼里，蛇就没有什么好歹之分。她讨厌蛇，不管它是哪一种、哪一类。不管你怎么说，只要是蛇，她就受不了。每逢有一条蛇跌到她身上，不论她正在干着什么，她就一概丢下活儿往外跑。这样的女人我真没见过。而且你能听到她大声叫喊。你就是告诉她用火钳就能把蛇给夹住，她也不干。要是她睡时一翻身，看见了床上盘着一条蛇，那她就马上滚下床来，拼命嚎叫，仿佛房子着了火。她还把那位老人吵得六神无主，弄得他只好说，他但愿上帝创造万物时能没有创造蛇才好。啊，即便最后一条蛇在屋里消失了已经有一个星期了，对萨莉阿姨来说，这事还未了结，还谈不到快了结这样的话。只要她坐着想些什么，你用一根羽毛在她颈背后轻轻一拂，她会立时立刻跳将起来，吓得魂不附体。这也真怪。不过据汤姆说，女人一概如此。他说，她们这是生来便是如此，不知道是什么原因。" name="description">

<div class="line_en">We got a splendid stock of sorted spiders, and bugs, and frogs, and caterpillars, and one thing or another; and we like to got a hornet's nest, but we didn't. The family was at home. We didn't give it right up, but stayed with them as long as we could; because we allowed we'd tire them out or they'd got to tire us out, and they done it. Then we got allycumpain and rubbed on the places, and was pretty near all right again, but couldn't set down convenient. And so we went for the snakes, and grabbed a couple of dozen garters and house-snakes, and put them in a bag, and put it in our room, and by that time it was suppertime, and a rattling good honest day's work: and hungry? – oh, no, I reckon not! And there warn't a blessed snake up there when we went back – we didn't half tie the sack, and they worked out somehow, and left. But it didn't matter much, because they was still on the premises somewheres. So we judged we could get some of them again. No, there warn't no real scarcity of snakes about the house for a considerable spell. You'd see them dripping from the rafters and places every now and then; and they generly landed in your plate, or down the back of your neck, and most of the time where you didn't want them. Well, they was handsome and striped, and there warn't no harm in a million of them; but that never made no difference to Aunt Sally; she despised snakes, be the breed what they might, and she couldn't stand them no way you could fix it; and every time one of them flopped down on her, it didn't make no difference what she was doing, she would just lay that work down and light out. I never see such a woman. And you could hear her whoop to Jericho. You couldn't get her to take a-holt of one of them with the tongs. And if she turned over and found one in bed she would scramble out and lift a howl that you would think the house was afire. She disturbed the old man so that he said he could most wish there hadn't ever been no snakes created. Why, after every last snake had been gone clear out of the house for as much as a week Aunt Sally warn't over it yet; she warn't near over it; when she was setting thinking about something you could touch her on the back of her neck with a feather and she would jump right out of her stockings. It was very curious. But Tom said all women was just so. He said they was made that way for some reason or other.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the morning we went up to the village and bought a wire rat-trap and fetched it down, and unstopped the best rat-hole, and in about an hour we had fifteen of the bulliest kind of ones; and then we took it and put it in a safe place under Aunt Sally's bed. But while we was gone for spiders little Thomas Franklin Benjamin Jefferson Elexander Phelps found it there, and opened the door of it to see if the rats would come out, and they did; and Aunt Sally she come in, and when we got back she was a-standing on top of the bed raising Cain, and the rats was doing what they could to keep off the dull times for her. So she took and dusted us both with the hickry, and we was as much as two hours catching another fifteen or sixteen, drat that meddlesome cub, and they warn't the likeliest, nuther, because the first haul was the pick of the flock. I never see a likelier lot of rats than what that first haul was.</div>

<div class="line_en">We got a licking every time one of our snakes come in her way, and she allowed these lickings warn't nothing to what she would do if we ever loaded up the place again with them. I didn't mind the lickings, because they didn't amount to nothing; but I minded the trouble we had to lay in another lot. But we got them laid in, and all the other things; and you never see a cabin as blithesome as Jim's was when they'd all swarm out for music and go for him. Jim didn't like the spiders, and the spiders didn't like Jim; and so they'd lay for him, and make it mighty warm for him. And he said that between the rats and the snakes and the grindstone there warn't no room in bed for him, skasely; and when there was, a body couldn't sleep, it was so lively, and it was always lively, he said, because THEY never all slept at one time, but took turn about, so when the snakes was asleep the rats was on deck, and when the rats turned in the snakes come on watch, so he always had one gang under him, in his way, and t'other gang having a circus over him, and if he got up to hunt a new place the spiders would take a chance at him as he crossed over. He said if he ever got out this time he wouldn't ever be a prisoner again, not for a salary.</div>

<div class="line_en">Well, by the end of three weeks everything was in pretty good shape. The shirt was sent in early, in a pie, and every time a rat bit Jim he would get up and write a little in his journal whilst the ink was fresh; the pens was made, the inscriptions and so on was all carved on the grindstone; the bed-leg was sawed in two, and we had et up the sawdust, and it give us a most amazing stomach-ache. We reckoned we was all going to die, but didn't. It was the most undigestible sawdust I ever see; and Tom said the same. But as I was saying, we'd got all the work done now, at last; and we was all pretty much fagged out, too, but mainly Jim. The old man had wrote a couple of times to the plantation below Orleans to come and get their runaway nigger, but hadn't got no answer, because there warn't no such plantation; so he allowed he would advertise Jim in the St. Louis and New Orleans papers; and when he mentioned the St. Louis ones it give me the cold shivers, and I see we hadn't no time to lose. So Tom said, now for the nonnamous letters.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这样，一直到第三个星期的末了，一切进行得非常有条有理。衬衫早就放在馅饼里送了进来。每一回耗子咬他一口，杰姆便起身，趁血水未干，在日记上写点儿什么。笔也磨好了，题词等等已经刻在磨刀石上了。床腿已经一锯为二。锯下的木屑，我们已经吃了，结果肚子痛得要命。我们原以为这下子要送命了，可是倒并没有。这种木屑之难于消化，是我见所未见的了。汤姆也是这么个说法。不过，正如我说的，这些活儿如今都终于完成了。我们都吃尽了苦头，最苦的还是杰姆。那位老人写了好几封信到奥尔良下面的那家农场，要他们来把逃跑的黑奴领回去。不过信去后没有收到回信。因为根本没有那么一个农场。所以他表示，要在圣路易和新奥尔良两地的报纸上为招领杰姆登广告。这个消息，我听后全身冰凉得直发抖。我看，我们再也耽误不得啦。汤姆因此说，写匿名信的时机如今到啦。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Warnings to the people that something is up. Sometimes it's done one way, sometimes another. But there's always somebody spying around that gives notice to the governor of the castle. When Louis XVI. was going to light out of the Tooleries a servantgirl done it. It's a very good way, and so is the nonnamous letters. We'll use them both. And it's usual for the prisoner's mother to change clothes with him, and she stays in, and he slides out in her clothes. We'll do that, too."</div>
