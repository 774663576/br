<div class="line_en">We stayed huddled that way until the early hours of the morning. The shootings and explosions had lasted less than an hour, but they had frightened us badly, because none of us had ever heard gunshots in the streets. They were foreign sounds to us then. The generation of Afghan children whose ears would know nothing but the sounds of bombs and gunfire was not yet born. Huddled together in the dining room and waiting for the sun to rise, none of us had any notion that a way of life had ended. Our way of life. If not quite yet, then at least it was the beginning of the end. The end, the "official" end, would come first in April 1978 with the communist coup d'etat, and then in December 1979, when Russian tanks would roll into the very same streets where Hassan and I played, bringing the death of the Afghanistan I knew and marking the start of a still ongoing era of bloodletting.</div>

I heard people on the street, jolted from sleep and probably still in their pajamas, with ruffled hair and puffy eyes. Hassan was crying. Ali pulled him close, clutched him with tenderness.

Then he appeared in the doorway and I saw something on his face. Something I didn't recognize right away because I'd never seen it before: fear. "Amir!

<div class="line_en">Assef was the son of one of my father's friends, Mahmood, an airline pilot. His family lived a few streets south of our Home, in a posh, high-walled compound with palm trees. If you were a kid living in the Wazir Akbar Khan section of Kabul, you knew about Assef and his famous stainless-steel brass knuckles, hopefully not through personal experience. Born to a German mother and Afghan father, the blond, blue-eyed Assef towered over the other kids. His well-earned reputation for savagery preceded him on the streets. Flanked by his obeying friends, he walked the neighborhood like a Khan strolling through his land with his eager-to-please entourage. His word was law, and if you needed a little legal education, then those brass knuckles were just the right teaching tool. I saw him use those knuckles once on a kid from the Karteh-Char district. I will never forget how Assef's blue eyes glinted with a light not entirely sane and how he grinned, how he "grinned", as he pummeled that poor kid unconscious. Some of the boys in Wazir Akbar Khan had nicknamed him Assef "Goshkhor", or Assef "the Ear Eater." Of course, none of them dared utter it to his face unless they wished to suffer the same fate as the poor kid who had unwittingly inspired that nickname when he had fought Assef over a kite and ended up Fishing his right ear from a muddy gutter. Years later, I learned an English word for the creature that Assef was, a word for which a good Farsi equivalent does not exist: "sociopath."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿塞夫的父亲叫马赫穆德，我爸爸的朋友，是个飞机驾驶员。他家位于一处豪华的住宅区，深院高墙，棕榈环绕，就在我们家南边，只隔了几条街。住在喀布尔瓦兹尔·阿克巴·汗区的小孩，人人都知道阿塞夫和他那臭名昭著的不锈钢拳套，谁都不愿意尝尝它的滋味。由于父亲是阿富汗人，母亲是德国人，蓝眼睛的阿塞夫头发金黄，身材比其他孩子都要高大。他凶残成性，恶名远播，人们总是避之惟恐不及。他身旁有群为虎作伥的党羽，走在附近的街道上，宛如可汗在阿谀逢迎的部属陪伴下，视察自己的领地。他说的话就是法律，如果你需要一点法律教育，那么他那不锈钢拳套无疑是最好的教具。我曾见过他用那拳套折磨一个卡德察区的小孩。我永远都不会忘记阿塞夫蓝色的眼睛中闪烁的近乎疯狂的光芒，还有他那邪恶的笑脸——那可怜的孩子被他痛击得不省人事，他竟然咧嘴而笑。瓦兹尔·阿克巴·汗区某些儿童给他起了个花名，叫“吃耳朵的阿塞夫”。当然，没有人胆敢当面这样称呼他，除非他们想亲身体会那个可怜孩子的下场：他跟阿塞夫争夺一只风筝，结果之后在路边的臭水沟打捞自己的右耳。多年以后，我学到了一个英文单词，在法尔西语找不到对应的字眼，可以用来形容阿塞夫那样的人渣：反社会分子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Good morning, 'kunis'!" Assef exclaimed, waving. "Fag," that was another of his favorite insults. Hassan retreated behind me as the three older boys closed in. They stood before us, three tall boys dressed in jeans and T-shirts. Towering over us all, Assef crossed his thick arms on his chest, a savage sort of grin on his lips. Not for the first time, it occurred to me that Assef might not be entirely sane. It also occurred to me how lucky I was to have Baba as my father, the sole reason, I believe, Assef had mostly refrained from harassing me too much.</div>

<div class="line_en">Assef slipped on the brass knuckles. Gave me an icy look. "You're part of the problem, Amir. If idiots like you and your father didn't take these people in, we'd be rid of them by now. They'd all just go rot in Hazarajat where they belong. You're a disgrace to Afghanistan."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿塞夫戴上他的不锈钢拳套，冷冷瞟了我一眼。“你也是个问题，阿米尔。如果没有你和你父亲这样的白痴，收容这些哈扎拉人，我们早就可以清除他们了。他们全都应该去哈扎拉贾特Hazarajat，阿富汗中部山区，为哈扎拉人聚居地。，在那个属于他们的地方烂掉。你是个阿富汗败类。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was a flurry of rapid movement behind me. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Hassan bend down and stand up quickly. Assef's eyes flicked to something behind me and widened with surprise. I saw that same look ol astonishment on Kamal and Wali's faces as they too saw what had happened behind me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我背后传来一阵急遽的活动声音。我眼角一瞄，看见哈桑弯下腰，迅速地站起来。阿塞夫朝我身后望去，吃惊地瞪大了眼睛。我看见瓦里和卡莫也看着我身后，眼里同样带着震惊的神色。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I looked in his crazy eyes and saw that he meant it. He really meant to hurt me. Assef raised his fist and came for me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我看着他那狂妄的眼睛，看懂了他的眼色，他是真的要伤害我。阿塞夫举起拳头，向我走来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I turned and came face to face with Hassan's slingshot. Hassan had pulled the wide elastic band all the way back. In the cup was a rock the size of a walnut. Hassan held the slingshot pointed directly at Assef's face. His hand trembled with the strain of the pulled elastic band and beads of sweat had erupted on his brow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我转过身，正好看到哈桑的弹弓。哈桑把那根橡皮带满满拉开，弓上是一块核桃大小的石头。哈桑用弹弓对着阿塞夫的脸，他用尽力气拉着弹弓，双手颤抖，汗珠在额头上渗出来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Please leave us alone, Agha," Hassan said in a flat tone. He'd referred to Assef as "Agha", and I wondered briefly what it must be like to live with such an ingrained sense of one's place in a hierarchy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“请让我们走，少爷。”哈桑语气平静地说。他称呼阿塞夫为少爷，有个念头在我脑里一闪而过：带着这种根深蒂固的意识，生活在一个等级分明的地方，究竟是什么滋味？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Hassan shrugged. To an outsider, he didn't look scared. But Hassan's face was my earliest memory and I knew all of its subtle nuances, knew each and every twitch and flicker that ever rippled across it. And I saw that he was scared. He was scared plenty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈桑耸耸肩。在外人看来，他镇定自若，但哈桑的脸是我从小就看惯了的，我清楚它所有细微的变化，他脸上任何一丝颤动都躲不过我的眼睛。我看得出他很害怕，非常害怕。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Assef's mouth twitched. Wali and Kamal watched this exchange with something akin to fascination. Someone had challenged their god. Humiliated him. And, worst of all, that someone was a skinny Hazara. Assef looked from the rock to Hassan. He searched Hassan's face intently. What he found in it must have convinced him of the seriousness of Hassan's intentions, because he lowered his fist.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿塞夫的嘴巴抽搐了一下。瓦里和卡莫看到强弱易势，简直无法置信，有人在挑战他们的神，羞辱他。更糟糕的是，这个家伙居然是个瘦小的哈扎拉人。阿塞夫看看那块石头，又看看哈桑。他仔细看着哈桑的脸，他所看到的，一定让他相信哈桑并非妄言恫吓，因为他放下了拳头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You are right, Agha. But perhaps you didn't notice that I'm the one holding the slingshot. If you make a move, they'll have to change your nickname from Assef 'the Ear Eater' to 'One-Eyed Assef', because I have this rock pointed at your left eye." He said this so flatly that even I had to strain to hear the fear that I knew hid under that calm voice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，少爷。但也许你没有看到，拉着弹弓的人是我。如果你敢动一动，他们会改掉你的花名，不再叫你‘吃耳朵的阿塞夫‘，而是叫你‘独眼龙阿塞夫‘。因为我这块石头对准你的左眼。”他泰然自若地说着，就算是我，也要费尽力气才能听得出他平静的声音下面的恐惧。">查看中文翻译</div>

"This isn't the end for you either, Amir. Someday, I'll make you face me one on one." Assef retreated a step. His disciples followed.</div>

<div class="line_en">FOR THE NEXT COUPLE of years, the words "economic development" and "reform" danced on a lot of lips in Kabul. The constitutional monarchy had been abolished, replaced by a republic, led by a president of the republic. For a while, a sense of rejuvenation and purpose swept across the land. People spoke of women's rights and modern technology.</div>

<div class="line_en">Hassan was trying to tuck the slingshot in his waist with a pair of trembling hands. His mouth curled up into something that was supposed to be a reassuring smile. It took him five tries to tie the string of his trousers. Neither one of us said much of anything as we walked Home in trepidation, certain that Assef and his friends would ambush us every time we turned a corner. They didn't and that should have comforted us a little. But it didn't. Not at all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈桑双手颤抖，努力把弹弓插回腰间。他的双唇弯起，或是想露出一个安心的微笑吧。他试了五次，才把弹弓系在裤子上。我们脚步沉重地走回家，深知阿塞夫和他的朋友很可能在某个拐角处等着收拾我们，没有人开口说话。他们没有，那应该让我们松一口气。但是我们没有，根本就没有。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And for the most part, even though a new leader lived in "Arg" -- the royal palace in Kabul-life went on as before. People went to work Saturday through Thursday and gathered for picnics on Fridays in parks, on the banks of Ghargha Lake, in the gardens of Paghman. Multicolored buses and lorries filled with passengers rolled through the narrow streets of Kabul, led by the constant shouts of the driver assistants who straddled the vehicles'rear bumpers and yelped directions to the driver in their thick Kabuli accent. On "Eid", the three days of celebration after the holy month of Ramadan, Kabulis dressed in their best and newest clothes and visited their families. People hugged and kissed and greeted each other with "Eid Mubarak." Happy Eid. Children opened gifts and played with dyed hard-boiled eggs.</div>

<div class="line_en">Like Hassan, Ali was incapable of lying. Every year, he pretended not to know what Baba had bought Hassan or me for our birthdays. And every year, his eyes betrayed him and we coaxed the goods out of him. This time, though, it seemed he was telling the truth.</div>

<div class="line_en">Baba never missed Hassan's birthday. For a while, he used to ask Hassan what he wanted, but he gave up doing that because Hassan was always too modest to actually suggest a present. So every winter Baba picked something out himself. He bought him a Japanese toy truck one year, an electric locomotive and train track set another year. The previous year, Baba had surprised Hassan with a leather cowboy hat just like the one Clint Eastwood wore in "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" -- which had unseated "The Magnificent Seven" as our favorite Western. That whole winter, Hassan and I took turns wearing the hat, and belted out the film's famous music as we climbed mounds of snow and shot each other dead.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爸爸从来不会忘记哈桑的生日。曾经，他经常问哈桑想要什么，但后来他就不问了，因为哈桑要的东西太过细微，简直不能被称之为礼物，所以每年冬天爸爸自行挑选些东西。有一年他给买了一套日本的玩具车。上一年，爸爸让哈桑喜出望外，给他买了一顶毛皮牛仔帽，克林特·伊斯伍德带着这种帽子演出了《黄金三镖客》——这部电影取代了《七侠荡寇志》，成为我们最喜爱的西部片。整整一个冬天，哈桑和我轮流戴那顶帽子，唱着那首著名的电影主题曲，爬上雪堆，打雪仗。">查看中文翻译</div>

I knew that when doctors said it wouldn't hurt, that's when you knew you were in trouble. With dread, I remembered my circumcision the year prior. The doctor had given me the same line, reassured me it wouldn't hurt one bit. But when the numbing Medicine wore off later that night, it felt like someone had pressed a red hot coal to my loins. Why Baba waited until I was ten to have me circumcised was beyond me and one of the things I will never forgive him for.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“噢。”哈桑说。他松了一口气，微笑着，但也只是松了一口气。“我不是害怕，老爷，我只是…”哈桑也许是个傻瓜，我可不是。我知道要是医生跟你说不会痛的时候，你的麻烦就大了。我心悸地想起去年割包皮的情形，医生也是这么对我说，安慰说那不会很痛。但那天深夜，麻醉药的药性消退之后，感觉像有人拿着又红又热的木炭在烫我的下阴。爸爸为什么要等到我十岁才让我割包皮呢？我百思不得其解，这也是我永远无法原谅他的事情之一。">查看中文翻译</div>
