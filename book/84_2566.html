<div class="line_en">Somehow I got back into my building, then I sat on my bed and tried to reconstruct what had happened. I remembered going to sleep. I remembered the dream. What I did not remember was flying from my bed and sprinting down the hall and into the street, shouting, but that is what I had done.</div>

<div class="line_en">The dream had been of home. Dad had built a maze on Buck's Peak and trapped me inside it. The walls were ten feet high and made of supplies from his root cellar -- sacks of grain, cases of ammunition, drums of honey. I was searching for something, something precious I could never replace. I had to escape the maze to recover it, but I couldn't find the way out, and Dad was pursuing me, sealing the exits with sacks of grain stacked into barricades.</div>

<div class="line_en">Someone was screaming, a long, steady holler, so loud it woke me up. It was dark. There were streetlights, pavement, the rumble of distant cars. I was standing in the middle of Oxford Street, half a block from my dorm room. My feet were bare, and I was wearing a tank top and flannel pajama bottoms. It felt like people were gawking at me, but it was two in the morning and the street was empty.</div>

<div class="line_en">I did not study. I tried to read but the sentences meant nothing. I needed them to mean nothing. I couldn't bear to string sentences into strands of thought, or to weave those strands into ideas. Ideas were too similar to reflection, and my reflections were always of the expression on my father's stretched face the moment before he'd fled from me.</div>

<div class="line_en">The thing about having a mental breakdown is that no matter how obvious it is that you're having one, it is somehow not obvious to you. I'm fine, you think. So what if I watched TV for twenty-four straight hours yesterday. I'm not falling apart. I'm just lazy. Why it's better to think yourself lazy than think yourself in distress, I'm not sure. But it was better. More than better: it was vital.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="精神崩溃的问题在于，不管你崩溃得多明显，你都会不以为然。你会想，我很好，所以我昨天连续看了二十四个小时的电视又有什么关系呢。我没有崩溃。我只是太懒。我不知道为什么认为自己懒惰比认为自己陷入困境要好。但那的确更好。不只更好：那至关重要。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I stopped going to my French group, then to my sketching class. Instead of reading in the library or attending lectures, I watched TV in my room, working my way through every popular series from the past two decades. When one episode ended, I would begin the next without thinking, the way one breath follows another. I watched TV eighteen or twenty hours a day. When I slept I dreamed of home, and at least once a week I awoke standing in the street in the middle of the night, wondering if it was my own cry that I'd heard just before waking.</div>

<div class="line_en">I purchased a ticket to Idaho for Christmas. Two days before the flight, I awoke in a cold sweat. I'd dreamed I was in a hospital, lying on crisp white sheets. Dad was at the foot of the gurney, telling a policeman I had stabbed myself. Mother echoed him, her eyes panicked. I was surprised to hear Drew's voice, shouting that I needed to be moved to another hospital. "He'll find her here," he kept saying.</div>

You'll be put in the basement and given some lavender for the wound. He begged me not to go, saying a hundred things I already knew and didn't care about, and when that didn't work, he said: You told me your story so I could stop you if you ever did something crazy. Well, Tara, this is it. This is crazy.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="我于一个晴朗的冬日早晨抵达了巴克峰。我记得走近房子时，闻到冻土清爽的气息，感觉到靴子下冰和碎石的吱嘎声。天空一片蔚蓝。我呼吸着松树的清香，它们好像在欢迎我回家。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">My gaze dropped below the mountain and my breath caught. When Grandma had been alive, she had, by nagging, shouting and threats, kept my father's junkyard contained. Now refuse covered the farm and was creeping toward the mountain base. The rolling hills, once perfect lakes of snow, were dotted with mangled trucks and rusted septic tanks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我往山下一看，屏住了呼吸。奶奶在世时，她曾经靠唠叨、喊叫和威胁来限制父亲扩大废料场的规模。现在垃圾铺满农场，慢慢向山脚移动。连绵起伏的群山和曾经完美如一片湖泊的雪地上布满了破旧的卡车和生锈的化粪池。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="我走进门时，母亲欣喜若狂。我事先没告诉她我要回来，也不想让人知道，可能为了躲着肖恩。她语速很快，神情紧张。“我去给你做饼干和肉汁！”说完，她快步进了厨房。">查看中文翻译</div>

I sat down to write Drew, because I'd promised, as a kind of compromise between us, that while on the mountain I would write to him every two hours. I nudged the mouse and the screen flickered on. The browser was already open; someone had forgotten to sign out. I moved to open a different browser but stopped when I saw my name. It was in the message that was open on the screen, which Mother had sent only moments before. To Shawn's ex-girlfriend Erin.</div>

<div class="line_en">The premise of the message was that Shawn had been reborn, spiritually cleansed. That the Atonement had healed our family, and that all had been restored. All except me. The spirit has whispered to me the truth about my daughter, Mother wrote. My poor child has given herself over to fear, and that fear has made her desperate to validate her misperceptions. I do not know if she is a danger to our family, but I have reasons to think she might be.</div>

<div class="line_en">There was more to the email. In the final paragraph, Mother described the birth of Emily's second child, a daughter, who had been born a month before. Mother had midwifed the child. The birth had taken place at home and, according to Mother, Emily had nearly bled to death before they could get to a hospital. Mother finished the story by testifying: God had worked through her hands that night, she said. The birth was a testament of His power.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="邮件中还有更多内容。在最后一段，母亲描述了埃米莉第二个孩子的出生。这次是个女儿，一个月前在家中由母亲接生。据母亲说，埃米莉在去医院前差点失血过多而死。母亲以自己的见证结束了这个故事：那一晚上帝通过她的双手工作。婴儿的出生证明了他的神力。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I remembered the drama of Peter's birth: how he'd slipped out of Emily weighing little more than a pound; how he'd been such a shocking shade of gray, they'd thought he was dead; how they'd fought through a snowstorm to the hospital in town, only to be told it wasn't enough, and there were no choppers flying; how two ambulances had been dispatched to McKay-Dee in Ogden. That a woman with this medical history, a woman so obviously high-risk, should be advised to attempt a second birth at home seemed reckless to the point of delusion.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我想起彼得出生时戏剧性的一幕：只有一磅多点儿的他如何从埃米莉的身体中滑了出来；他如何吓人地面如死灰，以至于大家以为他已经死了；他们如何冒着暴风雪来到镇上的医院，却仅仅被告知医疗条件不足，也没法派直升机；两辆救护车如何被派往奥格登的麦凯迪医院。让一个有如此病史、生育风险如此之高的女人在家里进行第二次生产，这简直是不顾后果的荒唐行为。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I was still wondering at the birth of my niece when Erin's response appeared. You are right about Tara, she said. She is lost without faith. Erin told Mother that my doubting myself -- my writing to her, Erin, to ask if I might be mistaken, if my memories might be false -- was evidence that my soul was in jeopardy, that I couldn't be trusted: She is building her life on fear. I will pray for her. Erin ended the message by praising my mother's skill as a midwife. You are a true hero, she wrote.</div>

I had wanted to escape the maze with its disorienting switchbacks, its ever-modulating pathways, to find the precious thing. But now I understood: the precious thing, that was the maze. That's all that was left of the life I'd had here: a puzzle whose rules I would never understand, because they were not rules at all but a kind of cage meant to enclose me. I could stay, and search for what had been home, or I could go, now, before the walls shifted and the way out was shut.</div>

<div class="line_en">My fellowship at Harvard finished in the spring. I flew to the Middle East, where Drew was completing a Fulbright. It took some effort, but I managed to hide from Drew how poorly I was doing, or at least I thought I did. I probably didn't. He was, after all, the one chasing me through his flat when I awoke in the middle of the night, screaming and sprinting, with no idea where I was but a desperate need to escape it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈佛的奖学金项目到春天便结束了。我飞到中东，德鲁正在那里完成福布莱特奖学金项目。我费了好大劲设法瞒住德鲁，不让他知道我的情况有多糟糕。至少我以为自己瞒住了，但很可能没有。毕竟，当我半夜从他的公寓里醒来，一边尖叫一边狂奔，不知自己身在何处，只是绝望地想逃时，是他跟在我后面追。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We left Amman and drove south. We were in a Bedouin camp in the Jordanian desert on the day the navy SEALs killed bin Laden. Drew spoke Arabic, and when the news broke he spent hours in conversation with our guides. "He's no Muslim," they told Drew as we sat on cold sand watching the dying flames of a campfire. "He does not understand Islam, or he would not do the terrible things he's done."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们离开安曼向南驶去。海豹突击队击毙本·拉登的那天，我们在约旦沙漠里一个贝都因人[7]营地。德鲁会说阿拉伯语，消息传来时，他与我们的导游交谈了好几个小时。“他不是穆斯林，”我们坐在冰冷的沙地上，看着篝火渐渐熄灭，他们对德鲁说，“他不了解伊斯兰教，否则不会做出那些可怕的事。”【注：[7]Bedouin，属于闪含语系民族，阿拉伯人的一支，以氏族部落为基本单位在沙漠旷野过着游牧生活。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I watched Drew talk with the Bedouins, heard the strange, smooth sounds falling from his lips, and was struck by the implausibility of my presence there. When the twin towers had fallen ten years before, I had never heard of Islam. Now I was drinking sugary tea with Zalabia Bedouins and squatting on a sand drift in Wadi Rum, the Valley of the Moon, less than twenty miles from the Saudi Arabian border.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我看着德鲁跟贝都因人交谈，听着从他嘴里发出的奇怪而流畅的声音，为自己不可思议地置身其中而感到震惊。十年前双子大楼倒塌时，我还从未听说过伊斯兰教；现在我却蹲在距离沙特阿拉伯边境不到二十英里、被称作“月亮谷”的瓦迪拉姆沙漠里，喝着甜茶，吃着中东薄饼。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I returned to England, where I continued to unravel. My first week back in Cambridge, I awoke nearly every night in the street, having run there, shouting, asleep. I developed headaches that lasted for days. My dentist said I was grinding my teeth. My skin broke out so severely that twice perfect strangers stopped me in the street and asked if I was having an allergic reaction. No, I said. I always look like this.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我回到英国，继续学业。回剑桥的第一个星期，几乎每晚我都梦游着跑到街上大喊大叫，然后醒来。头痛连日不绝。牙医说我磨牙。我的皮肤严重破损，有两次完全陌生的人在街上拦住我，问我是不是过敏了。没有，我说，我一直就这样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The distance -- physical and mental -- that had been traversed in the last decade nearly stopped my breath, and I wondered if perhaps I had changed too much. All my studying, reading, thinking, traveling, had it transformed me into someone who no longer belonged anywhere? I thought of the girl who, knowing nothing beyond her junkyard and her mountain, had stared at a screen, watching as two planes sailed into strange white pillars. Her classroom was a heap of junk. Her textbooks, slates of scrap. And yet she had something precious that I -- despite all my opportunities, or maybe because of them -- did not.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在过去的十年里，我穿越的距离——物理上的和精神上的——几乎让我无法呼吸，让我思考起自己是否已改变得太多。我所有的学习、阅读、思考和旅行，是否已将我变成一个不再属于任何地方的人？我想起那个女孩，那个除了她的废料场和大山，一无所知的女孩。她曾经盯着电视屏幕，看着两架飞机驶入奇怪的白色柱状物。她的教室是一片垃圾，她的课本是废铜烂铁。然而她却拥有我所没有的珍贵东西。尽管我现在拥有很多机会，或者也许正因为这些机会，我才失去了那个珍贵之物。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">My mother begged me to find another way. My father said nothing.</div>

<div class="line_en">One evening, I got into an argument with a friend about something trivial, and before I knew what was happening I had pressed myself into the wall and was hugging my knees to my chest, trying to keep my heart from leaping out of my body. My friend rushed toward me to help and I screamed. It was an hour before I could let her touch me, before I could will myself away from the wall. So that's a panic attack, I thought the next morning.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一天晚上，我和一个朋友就一件小事吵了起来，不等我弄明白发生了什么，我已经将自己塞进墙角，环抱膝盖，试图阻止心脏从身体里跳出来。朋友冲过来帮我，我便高声尖叫。一小时后我才让她碰我，才让自己离开墙边。第二天早上，我意识到，这就是恐慌症发作。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Soon after, I sent a letter to my father. I'm not proud of that letter. It's full of rage, a fractious child screaming, "I hate you" at a parent. It's filled with words like "thug" and "tyrant," and it goes on for pages, a torrent of frustration and abuse.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="之后不久，我给父亲写了一封信。我并不以那封信为荣。信中充满了愤怒，就像一个任性的孩子在对父母大喊“我恨你们”。信中充斥着诸如“暴徒”和“暴君”之类的字眼，连篇累牍，全是一系列的挫败感和谩骂。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That is how I told my parents I was cutting off contact with them. Between insults and fits of temper, I said I needed a year to heal myself; then perhaps I could return to their mad world to try to make sense of it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我就是用这种方式告诉父母，我要与他们断绝关系。在谩骂和怒火之间，我说我需要一年时间为自己疗伤；之后也许我会回到他们疯狂的世界，试着去理解它。">查看中文翻译</div>
