<div class="line_en">1801 I have just returned from a visit to my landlord, Mr Heathcliff. I am delighted with the house I am renting from him. Thrushcross Grange is miles away from any town or village. That suits me perfectly. And the scenery here in Yorkshire is so beautiful!</div>

<div class="line_en">Mr Heathcliff, in fact, is my only neighbour, and I think his character is similar to mine. He does not like people either.</div>

<div class="line_en">"My name is Lockwood," I said, when I met him at the gate to his house. "I'm renting Thrushcross Grange from you. I just wanted to come and introduce myself."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Joseph, take Mr Lock wood's horse!" he called. "And bring up some wine from the cellar!" Joseph was a very old servant, with a sour expression on his face. He looked crossly up at me as he took my horse.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“约瑟夫，牵走洛克伍德先生的马！”他喊道，“到地窖里拿些酒上来！”约瑟夫是个很老的仆人，脸上表情乖戾。牵马时气鼓鼓地看了我一眼。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"God help us! A visitor!" he muttered to himself. Perhaps there were no other servants, I thought. And it seemed that Mr Heathcliff hardly ever received guests.</div>

<div class="line_en">His house is called Wuthering Heights. The name means "a windswept house on a hill", and it is a very good description. The trees around the house do not grow straight, but are bent by the north wind, which blows over the moors every day of the year. Fortunately, the house is strongly built, and is not damaged even by the worst winter storms. The name "Earnshaw" is cut into a stone over the front door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的房子叫呼啸山庄。意思是“狂风肆虐的山丘上的房子”，名字起得恰如其分。房子周围的树不是直着长，而是被常年累月里从荒原过来的北风吹弯的。好在房子造得结实，即使是冬天最烈的风暴也毁不了。房子正门的一块石头上刻着“欧肖”这个名字。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mr Heathcliff and I entered the huge main room. It could have been any Yorkshire farmhouse kitchen, except that there was no sign of cooking, and no farmer sitting at the table. Mr Heathcliff certainly does not look like a farmer. His hair and skin are dark, like a gipsy's, but he has the manners of a gentleman. He could perhaps take more care with his appearance, but he is handsome. I think he is proud, and also unhappy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="希斯克利夫先生和我进到极大的正房。它很像是约克郡一个普通农家的厨房，只是没有做饭的迹象，桌旁也没坐着农夫。希斯克利夫先生看上去显然不像个农夫，他的头发和皮肤是深色的，像吉卜赛人，但有绅士的派头。他还能对自己的外表再多上点儿心，但已经算得上英俊了。我觉得他很高傲，而且郁郁寡欢。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We sat down by the fire, in silence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们在火旁坐下，都没说话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Joseph!" shouted Mr Heathcliff. No answer came from the cellar, so he dived down there, leaving me alone with several rather fierce-looking dogs. Suddenly one of them jumped angrily up at me, and in a moment all the others were attacking me. From every shadowy corner in the great room appeared a growling animal, ready to kill me, it seemed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“约瑟夫！”希斯克利夫先生高声喊道。地窖里没有回答，于是他钻了下去，只剩下我单独和几条恶狗在一起。突然有一条气势汹汹地跳起来扑向我，随即其他的几条也都攻向我。这大屋子的每个阴暗角落都蹿出一条嗥叫的恶兽，似乎有要杀了我的架势。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Help! Mr Heathcliff! Help!" I shouted, trying to keep the dogs back. My landlord and his servant were in no hurry to help, and could not have climbed the cellar steps more slowly, but luckily a woman, who I supposed was the housekeeper, rushed into the room to calm the dogs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“救命呀！希斯克利夫先生！救命！”我一边竭力不让狗近身，一边高声喊道。我的房东和他的仆人根本不急于来解救我，从地窖的楼梯往上爬，慢得不能再慢了。但幸运的是有个女人，我猜她是这儿的女管家，冲进屋里把狗制服了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What the devil is the matter?" Mr Heathcliff asked me rudely, when he finally entered the room.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Come, come, Mr Lockwood. Have some wine. We don't often have strangers here, and I'm afraid neither I nor my dogs are used to receiving them."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好了，好了，洛克伍德先生，喝点酒。我们这儿不常来生人，恐怕我和我这些狗都不知道怎么接待客人。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I could not feel offended after this, and accepted the wine. We sat drinking and talking together for a while. I suggested visiting him tomorrow. He did not seem eager to see me again, but I shall go anyway. I am interested in him, even if he isn't interested in me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这么一来我倒没了被冒犯的感觉，接过了酒。我们坐在一起边喝边聊了一会儿。我提议明天再来拜访他。他对再见我似乎并没有热情，但无论如何我也得去。我对他很有兴趣，虽然他对我没有。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Two days later Yesterday afternoon was misty and bitterly cold, but I walked the four miles to Wuthering Heights and arrived just as it was beginning to snow. I banged on the front door for ten minutes, getting colder and colder. Finally Joseph's head appeared at a window of one of the farm buildings.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两天后。昨天下午有雾，天气阴冷，但我走了四英里去呼啸山庄，刚到就开始下雪了。我在前门使劲儿敲了10分钟，觉得越来越冷。最后约瑟夫终于从一间农舍的窗子里探出头来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他摇了摇头。“只有希斯克利夫夫人在家，她不会给你开门的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Just then a young man appeared and called me to follow him. We went through the back door and into the big room where I had been before. I was delighted to see a warm fire and a table full of food. And this time there was a woman sitting by the fire. She must be Mrs Heathcliff, I thought. I had not imagined my landlord was married. She looked at me coldly without saying anything.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在这时出现了一个年轻人，叫我跟他走。我们从后门进了我曾去过的那间大屋。看到暖暖的一炉火和一张摆满饭菜的桌子，我精神一振。这次有一个女人坐在火旁。我猜她一定就是希斯克利夫夫人了。我没料到我的房东已有家室。她冷冰冰地看着我，一声没吭。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Terrible weather!" I remarked. There was silence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这坏天气！”我说。还是沉默。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What a beautiful animal!" I tried again, pointing to one of the dogs that had attacked me. She still said nothing, but got up to make the tea. She was only about seventeen, with the most beautiful little face I had ever seen. Her golden wavy hair fell around her shoulders.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“真是条好狗！”我指着攻击过我的一条狗，又试探了一次。她还是没说话，却起身沏茶。她只有十七岁上下，一张脸蛋儿是我所见过的最美的。她金色、波浪般的头发披在肩上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Have you been invited to tea?" she asked me crossly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是请你来喝茶的吗？”她别扭地问了我一句。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No, but you are the proper person to invite me," I smiled.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，但您应该请我，”我微笑着说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For some reason this really annoyed her. She stopped making the tea, and threw herself angrily back in her chair. Meanwhile the young man was staring aggressively at me. He looked like a farm worker, but seemed to be part of the family. I did not feel at all comfortable. At last Heathcliff came in.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这话不知为何让她真的有些不悦。茶也不沏了，怒气十足地一屁股坐回她的椅子。同时，那个年轻人也挑衅似地盯着我。他看起来像个农场做工的，但又似乎是这个家庭的成员。我觉得很不自在。最后希斯克利夫终于进来了。">查看中文翻译</div>

Perhaps the poor girl had found no one better to marry in this uninhabited area. I turned politely to the young man.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然间我意识到我犯了个严重的错误。原来他的夫人已经死了！他这个年龄当然不会娶那么年轻的姑娘。她嫁的一定是我旁边的这个年轻人，他正从碗里喝茶，用来吃面包的手也没有洗。也许这可怜的姑娘在这人烟稀少的地方也找不到更好的人可嫁了。我恭敬地转向那年轻人。">查看中文翻译</div>
