<div class="line_en">When Toad found himself immured in a dank and noisome dungeon, and knew that all the grim darkness of a medieval fortress lay between him and the outer world of sunshine and well-metalled high roads where he had lately been so happy, disporting himself as if he had bought up every road in England, he flung himself at full length on the floor, and shed bitter tears, and abandoned himself to dark despair. 'This is the end of everything' (he said), 'at least it is the end of the career of Toad, which is the same thing; the popular and handsome Toad, the rich and hospitable Toad, the Toad so free and careless and debonair! How can I hope to be ever set at large again' (he said), 'who have been imprisoned so justly for stealing so handsome a motor-car in such an audacious manner, and for such lurid and imaginative cheek, bestowed upon such a number of fat, red-faced policemen!' (Here his sobs choked him.) 'Stupid animal that I was' (he said), 'now I must languish in this dungeon, till people who were proud to say they knew me, have forgotten the very name of Toad! O wise old Badger!' (he said), 'O clever, intelligent Rat and sensible Mole! What sound judgments, what a knowledge of men and matters you possess! O unhappy and forsaken Toad!' With lamentations such as these he passed his days and nights for several weeks, refusing his meals or intermediate light refreshments, though the grim and ancient gaoler, knowing that Toad's pockets were well lined, frequently pointed out that many comforts, and indeed luxuries, could by arrangement be sent in-at a price-from outside.</div>

<div class="line_en">Now the gaoler had a daughter, a pleasant wench and good-hearted, who assisted her father in the lighter duties of his post. She was particularly fond of animals, and, besides her canary, whose cage hung on a nail in the massive wall of the keep by day, to the great annoyance of prisoners who relished an after-dinner nap, and was shrouded in an antimacassar on the parlour table at night, she kept several piebald mice and a restless revolving squirrel. This kind-hearted girl, pitying the misery of Toad, said to her father one day, 'Father! I can't bear to see that poor beast so unhappy, and getting so thin! You let me have the managing of him. You know how fond of animals I am. I'll make him eat from my hand, and sit up, and do all sorts of things.'</div>

<div class="line_en">It was bubble-and-squeak, between two plates, and its fragrance filled the narrow cell. The penetrating smell of cabbage reached the nose of Toad as he lay prostrate in his misery on the floor, and gave him the idea for a moment that perhaps life was not such a blank and desperate thing as he had imagined. But still he wailed, and kicked with his legs, and refused to be comforted. So the wise girl retired for the time, but, of course, a good deal of the smell of hot cabbage remained behind, as it will do, and Toad, between his sobs, sniffed and reflected, and gradually began to think new and inspiring thoughts: of chivalry, and poetry, and deeds still to be done; of broad meadows, and cattle browsing in them, raked by sun and wind; of kitchen-gardens, and straight herb-borders, and warm snap-dragon beset by bees; and of the comforting clink of dishes set down on the table at Toad Hall, and the scrape of chair-legs on the floor as every one pulled himself close up to his work. The air of the narrow cell took a rosy tinge; he began to think of his friends, and how they would surely be able to do something; of lawyers, and how they would have enjoyed his case, and what an ass he had been not to get in a few; and lastly, he thought of his own great cleverness and resource, and all that he was capable of if he only gave his great mind to it; and the cure was almost complete.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是用两只盘子扣着的一份土豆加卷心菜，香气四溢，充满了狭小的牢房。蟾蜍正惨兮兮地伸开四肢躺在地上，卷心菜那股浓烈的香味钻进了他的鼻孔，一时间使他感到，生活也许还不像他想象的那样空虚绝望。不过，他还是悲伤地哭个没完，踢蹬着两腿，不理会她的安慰。聪明的姑娘暂时退了出去，不过当然，她带来的热菜的香气还留在牢房里。蟾蜍一边抽泣，一边用鼻子闻，同时心里想着，渐渐地想到了一些使他激动的新念头，想到侠义行为，想到诗歌，还有那些等着他去完成的业绩；想到广阔的草地，阳光下，微风里，在草地上吃草的牛羊；想到菜园子，整齐的花坛，被蜜蜂团团围住的暖融融的金鱼草；还想到蟾宫里餐桌上碗碟那悦耳的丁当声，和人们拉拢椅子就餐时椅子脚擦着地板的声音。狭小的囚室里的空气仿佛呈现出玫瑰色。他想起了自己的朋友们，他们准会设法营救他的；他想到律师，他们一定会对他的案子感兴趣的。他是多么愚蠢，当时为什么不请几位律师。末了，他想到自己原是绝顶聪明，足智多谋，只要肯动动自己那伟大的脑筋，世间万事他都能办到。想到这里，所有的苦恼几乎一扫而光了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When the girl returned, some hours later, she carried a tray, with a cup of fragrant tea steaming on it; and a plate piled up with very hot buttered toast, cut thick, very brown on both sides, with the butter running through the holes in it in great golden drops, like honey from the honeycomb. The smell of that buttered toast simply talked to Toad, and with no uncertain voice; talked of warm kitchens, of breakfasts on bright frosty mornings, of cosy parlour firesides on winter evenings, when one's ramble was over and slippered feet were propped on the fender; of the purring of contented cats, and the twitter of sleepy canaries. Toad sat up on end once more, dried his eyes, sipped his tea and munched his toast, and soon began talking freely about himself, and the house he lived in, and his doings there, and how important he was, and what a lot his friends thought of him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="几个钟头以后，姑娘又回来了。她端着一个托盘。盘里放着一杯冒着热气的香茶，还有堆得老高的一盘热腾腾的黄油烤面包。面包片切得厚厚的，两面都烤得焦黄，熔化的黄油顺着面包的孔眼直往下滴，变成金黄色的大油珠，象蜂巢里淌出来的蜜。黄油烤面包的气味，简直在向蟾蜍讲话，说得清清楚楚，半点不含糊。它讲到暖融融的厨房，明亮的霜晨的早餐；讲到冬日黄昏漫游归来，穿拖鞋的脚搁在炉架上，向着一炉舒适的旺火；讲到心满意足的猫儿打着呼噜，昏昏欲睡的金丝雀在啁啾。蟾蜍又一次坐起身来，抹去眼泪，啜起了茶，嚼开了烤面包，无拘无束地对姑娘谈起了他自己，他的房子，他在那里都干些什么，他是一位何等显要的人物，他的朋友们多么敬重他。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She tripped away, and presently returned with a fresh trayful; and Toad, pitching into the toast with avidity, his spirits quite restored to their usual level, told her about the boathouse, and the fish-pond, and the old walled kitchen-garden; and about the pig-styes, and the stables, and the pigeon-house, and the hen-house; and about the dairy, and the wash-house, and the china-cupboards, and the linen-presses (she liked that bit especially); and about the banqueting-hall, and the fun they had there when the other animals were gathered round the table and Toad was at his best, singing songs, telling stories, carrying on generally. Then she wanted to know about his animal-friends, and was very interested in all he had to tell her about them and how they lived, and what they did to pass their time. Of course, she did not say she was fond of animals as PETS, because she had the sense to see that Toad would be extremely offended. When she said good night, having filled his water-jug and shaken up his straw for him, Toad was very much the same sanguine, self-satisfied animal that he had been of old. He sang a little song or two, of the sort he used to sing at his dinner-parties, curled himself up in the straw, and had an excellent night's rest and the pleasantest of dreams.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她一溜小跑走开、很快又端来一盘吃的。蟾蜍贪馋地一头扎进烤面包，情绪多少恢复过来。他给她讲他的船仓、鱼塘、围墙里的菜园；讲他的猪圈、马厩、鸽房、鸡舍；讲他的牛奶棚、洗衣房、瓷器柜、熨衣板（这玩意她特喜欢）；讲他的宴会厅，他怎样招待别的动物围坐餐桌旁，而他蟾蜍如何意气风发，神采飞扬。又唱歌。又讲故事，诸如此类。然后，她又要他谈他的动物朋友们的情况，津津有味地听他讲他们怎样过活，怎样娱乐消遣，一切一切。当然，她没有说她是把动物当宠物来喜爱，因为她知道那会使蟾蜍大为反感。末了，她给他把水罐盛满，把铺草抖松，向他道了晚安。这时，他已经恢复到原先那个沾沾自喜、洋洋得意的蟾蜍了。他唱了一两支小曲儿，就是他过去在宴会上常唱的那种歌，蜷曲着身子躺在稻草里，美美地睡了一夜，还做了许多顶愉快的好梦。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">'Do be quiet a minute, Toad,' said the girl. 'You talk too much, that's your chief fault, and I'm trying to think, and you hurt my head. As I said, I have an aunt who is a washerwoman; she does the washing for all the prisoners in this castle-we try to keep any paying business of that sort in the family, you understand. She takes out the washing on Monday morning, and brings it in on Friday evening. This is a Thursday. Now, this is what occurs to me: you're very rich-at least you're always telling me so-and she's very poor. A few pounds wouldn't make any difference to you, and it would mean a lot to her. Now, I think if she were properly approached-squared, I believe is the word you animals use-you could come to some arrangement by which she would let you have her dress and bonnet and so on, and you could escape from the castle as the official washerwoman. You're very alike in many respects-particularly about the figure.'</div>

<div class="line_en">They had many interesting talks together, after that, as the dreary days went on; and the gaoler's daughter grew very sorry for Toad, and thought it a great shame that a poor little animal should be locked up in prison for what seemed to her a very trivial offence. Toad, of course, in his vanity, thought that her interest in him proceeded from a growing tenderness; and he could not help half-regretting that the social gulf between them was so very wide, for she was a comely lass, and evidently admired him very much.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="打那以后，沉闷的日子过了一天又一天，他们经常在一起谈得很投机。狱卒的女儿越来越替蟾蜍抱不平，她觉得，这么一只可怜的小动物，为了一件微不足道的过失，就给关在监牢里，太不应该了。蟾蜍呢，他的虚荣心又抬头了，以为她关心自己，是出于对自己滋生了恋情。只是他认为，他俩之间社会地位太悬殊，他不能不为此感到遗憾，因为她是个挺招人喜欢的小妞儿，而且显然对他一往情深。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Next evening the girl ushered her aunt into Toad's cell, bearing his week's washing pinned up in a towel. The old lady had been prepared beforehand for the interview, and the sight of certain gold sovereigns that Toad had thoughtfully placed on the table in full view practically completed the matter and left little further to discuss. In return for his cash, Toad received a cotton print gown, an apron, a shawl, and a rusty black bonnet; the only stipulation the old lady made being that she should be gagged and bound and dumped down in a corner. By this not very convincing artifice, she explained, aided by picturesque fiction which she could supply herself, she hoped to retain her situation, in spite of the suspicious appearance of things.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天傍晚，女孩把她的姑母领进蟾蜍的牢房，还带上本周要洗的衣服，用毛巾包好，别针别住。这次会见，事先已经向老太太打过招呼，而蟾蜍又细心周到地把一些金币放在桌上显眼的地方，于是谈判马到成功，无需多费唇舌。蟾蜍的金币换来了一件印花棉布裙衫、一条围裙、一条大围巾，还有一顶褪了色的黑布女帽。老太太提出的唯一条件，就是把她的嘴堵上，捆绑起来，扔在墙角。她解释说，凭着这样一种不太可信的伪装，加上她自己编造的一套有声有色的情节，她希望能保住自己的饭碗，尽管事情显得十分可疑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">With a quaking heart, but as firm a footstep as he could command, Toad set forth cautiously on what seemed to be a most hare-brained and hazardous undertaking; but he was soon agreeably surprised to find how easy everything was made for him, and a little humbled at the thought that both his popularity, and the sex that seemed to inspire it, were really another's. The washerwoman's squat figure in its familiar cotton print seemed a passport for every barred door and grim gateway; even when he hesitated, uncertain as to the right turning to take, he found himself helped out of his difficulty by the warder at the next gate, anxious to be off to his tea, summoning him to come along sharp and not keep him waiting there all night. The chaff and the humourous sallies to which he was subjected, and to which, of course, he had to provide prompt and effective reply, formed, indeed, his chief danger; for Toad was an animal with a strong sense of his own dignity, and the chaff was mostly (he thought) poor and clumsy, and the humour of the sallies entirely lacking. However, he kept his temper, though with great difficulty, suited his retorts to his company and his supposed character, and did his best not to overstep the limits of good taste.</div>

<div class="line_en">Peeping out, he saw his train get up speed again and disappear at a great pace. Then out of the tunnel burst the pursuing engine, roaring and whistling, her motley crew waving their various weapons and shouting, 'Stop! stop! stop!' When they were past, the Toad had a hearty laugh-for the first time since he was thrown into prison.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他从树林里往外窥望，只见他坐的那辆火车又一次加速行进，转眼间就消失不见了。接着，从隧道里冲出那辆追车，咆哮着，尖声鸣着笛，车上那帮杂合人群摇晃着各自不同的武器，高喊“停车！停车！停车！”等他们驶了过去时，蟾蜍禁不住哈哈大笑——自打入狱以来，他还是第一次笑得这样痛快。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But he soon stopped laughing when he came to consider that it was now very late and dark and cold, and he was in an unknown wood, with no money and no chance of supper, and still far from friends and home; and the dead silence of everything, after the roar and rattle of the train, was something of a shock. He dared not leave the shelter of the trees, so he struck into the wood, with the idea of leaving the railway as far as possible behind him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是，他很快就笑不起来了，因为他想到，这时已是深夜，又黑又冷，他来到了一座不熟悉的树林，身无分文，吃不上晚饭，仍旧远离朋友和家。火车震耳的隆隆声消逝以后，这里的一切像死一般寂静，怪吓人的。他不敢离开藏身的树丛，觉得离铁路越远越好，于是深深钻进林子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After so many weeks within walls, he found the wood strange and unfriendly and inclined, he thought, to make fun of him. Night-jars, sounding their mechanical rattle, made him think that the wood was full of searching warders, closing in on him. An owl, swooping noiselessly towards him, brushed his shoulder with its wing, making him jump with the horrid certainty that it was a hand; then flitted off, moth-like, laughing its low ho! ho! ho; which Toad thought in very poor taste. Once he met a fox, who stopped, looked him up and down in a sarcastic sort of way, and said, 'Hullo, washerwoman! Half a pair of socks and a pillow-case short this week! Mind it doesn't occur again!' and swaggered off, sniggering. Toad looked about for a stone to throw at him, but could not succeed in finding one, which vexed him more than anything. At last, cold, hungry, and tired out, he sought the shelter of a hollow tree, where with branches and dead leaves he made himself as comfortable a bed as he could, and slept soundly till the morning.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在监狱里蹲了这么久，他感到树林特生疏，特不友好，像成心在拿他取笑逗乐似的。夜鸳单调的嘎嘎声，使他觉得林中布满了搜索他的卫兵，从四面八方向他包抄过来。一只猫头鹰，悄没声地猝然向他扑来，翅膀擦着他的肩头，吓得他跳了起来，心惊胆战地想，那准是一只手；接着又像飞蛾一样轻轻掠过、发出一串低沉的“嗬！嗬！嗬！”的笑声，听起来非常下流。有一回，他碰上一只狐狸，那狐狸停下来，讥讽地朝他上下打量了一番，说：“喂，洗衣婆！这星期少了我一只袜子，一个枕套！下次留神别再犯！”说罢，窃笑着摇摇摆摆走开了。蟾蜍四处看，想找块石头打他，可就是找不到，更把他气坏了。末了，又冷，又饿，又乏，他找到一个树洞，躲了进去，设法用树枝和枯叶铺了一张将就舒适的床，沉沉睡着了，直睡到天明。">查看中文翻译</div>
