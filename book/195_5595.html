I was very ill with my bronchitis in the winter and Doctor Wigram never expected me to pull through. I have a wonderful constitution and I made, thank God, a marvellous recovery.</div>

<div class="line_en">The winter passed. Now and then Philip went to the hospital, slinking in when it was late and there was little chance of meeting anyone he knew, to see whether there were letters for him. At Easter he received one from his uncle. He was surprised to hear from him, for the Vicar of Blackstable had never written him more than half a dozen letters in his whole life, and they were on business matters.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="冬天过去了。菲利普偶尔趁天黑没人的时候，溜进医院查看有没有自己的信。复活节那天他收到一封伯伯的来信。这可真是千载难逢的事，布莱克斯塔布尔的牧师活了一辈子，给菲利普写的信加起来也不超过六七封，还都是为了谈正事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dear Philip,</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="亲爱的菲利普，">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The letter made Philip angry. How did his uncle think he was living? He did not even trouble to inquire. He might have starved for all the old man cared. But as he walked home something struck him; he stopped under a lamp-post and read the letter again; the handwriting had no longer the business-like firmness which had characterised it; it was larger and wavering: perhaps the illness had shaken him more than he was willing to confess, and he sought in that formal note to express a yearning to see the only relation he had in the world. Philip wrote back that he could come down to Blackstable for a fortnight in July. The invitation was convenient, for he had not known what to do, with his brief holiday. The Athelnys went hopping in September, but he could not then be spared, since during that month the autumn models were prepared. The rule of Lynn's was that everyone must take a fortnight whether he wanted it or not; and during that time, if he had nowhere to go, the assistant might sleep in his room, but he was not allowed food. A number had no friends within reasonable distance of London, and to these the holiday was an awkward interval when they had to provide food out of their small wages and, with the whole day on their hands, had nothing to spend. Philip had not been out of London since his visit to Brighton with Mildred, now two years before, and he longed for fresh air and the silence of the sea. He thought of it with such a passionate desire, all through May and June, that, when at length the time came for him to go, he was listless.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这封信让菲利普气不打一处来。在伯伯眼里，他过的是怎样的日子呢？他根本懒得过问了，就算自己饿死街头，那个老家伙也不会在乎。当他往家走的时候，似乎一下想到些什么，停在路灯下又掏出信来读了一遍。信上的笔迹已经不再像往日那样清晰整齐、刚劲有力，只见字大如斗，歪歪斜斜。也许他的病情远比自己所说的更为严重，而他只想以这封客套严肃的短信，向这世上仅剩的唯一亲人表达思念之情。菲利普回信说自己七月要回布莱克斯塔布尔待两周。实际上，这封邀请来得正是时候，他还不知道自己能去哪儿呢。阿西尔尼一家九月去采啤酒花，菲利普那时候刚好没空，因为商场要在十月之前布置好秋季的模特。林恩公司的传统是不管愿不愿意，每个人必须休两周的假。有些员工无处可去，就躺在宿舍里睡大觉，可这两周公司是不管饭的。好多人的朋友都离伦敦很远，对于他们来说，这假还不如不放。他们要从那点微薄的工资里抠出几个子儿来填饱肚子，整整两周，天天都无所事事，百无聊赖。菲利普最后一回离开伦敦还是和米尔德里德一起去布莱顿那次，转眼已经过去两年了，他想出去呼吸一点新鲜空气，渴望感受海边宁静而安逸的气息。五月、六月，整整两个月的时间，他都在热烈地期盼着，可等离开的时间终于到了，倒提不起精神来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Philip, asking after the affairs of the parish, looked at him and wondered how much longer he could last. A hot summer would finish him; Philip noticed how thin his hands were; they trembled. It meant so much to Philip. If he died that summer he could go back to the hospital at the beginning of the winter session; his heart leaped at the thought of returning no more to Lynn's. At dinner the Vicar sat humped up on his chair, and the housekeeper who had been with him since his wife's death said:</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="菲利普读着处方单，牧师在旁边急切地看着他。这方子是两味麻醉药。牧师说其中一种他只有在犯了神经炎，疼得实在受不了的时候才会吃。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Show the prescription to Master Philip," he said. "He's a doctor too. I'd like him to see that he thinks it's all right. I told Dr. Wigram that now you're studying to be a doctor he ought to make a reduction in his charges. It's dreadful the bills I've had to pay. He came every day for two months, and he charges five shillings a visit. It's a lot of money, isn't it? He comes twice a week still. I'm going to tell him he needn't come any more. I'll send for him if I want him."</div>

<div class="line_en">He did not mention his nephew's affairs. Philip fancied that it was by way of precaution, in case he asked for money, that his uncle kept dwelling on the financial calls upon him. He had spent so much on the doctor and so much more on the chemist, while he was ill they had had to have a fire every day in his bed-room, and now on Sunday he needed a carriage to go to church in the evening as well as in the morning. Philip felt angrily inclined to say he need not be afraid, he was not going to borrow from him, but he held his tongue. It seemed to him that everything had left the old man now but two things, pleasure in his food and a grasping desire for money. It was a hideous old age.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对自己侄子的事，牧师绝口不提。菲利普想这也许是一种提前预防吧，以防自己又跟他借钱。伯伯絮叨着最近花钱的地方太多了。看医生已经花了不少，买药又要花一大笔，而且生病之后卧室每天都要生炉子，礼拜天一早一晚去教堂礼拜都要叫辆马车才行。菲利普气得想脱口而出：“不用怕，我不从你这借钱！”可话到嘴边还是咽回去了。他觉得这个老头儿的生活里只剩下两样东西：吃喝带来的乐趣和手里紧攥的那点儿钱。人到晚年，其恶自现啊！">查看中文翻译</div>

He had practised at Blackstable for five-and-thirty years. He had the reputation of being very safe, and many of his patients thought it much better that a doctor should be safe than clever. There was a new man at Blackstable -- he had been settled there for ten years, but they still looked upon him as an interloper -- and he was said to be very clever; but he had not much practice among the better people, because no one really knew anything about him.</div>

<div class="line_en">On the tip of Philip's tongue was the question: how much longer can he live? He was afraid it would shock. In these matters a periphrase was demanded by the decorum of life, but, as he asked another question instead, it flashed through him that the doctor must be accustomed to the impatience of a sick man's relatives. He must see through their sympathetic expressions. Philip, with a faint smile at his own hypocrisy, cast down his eyes.</div>

On the other hand, if you said the patient might live a year and he died in a week the family said you did not know your business. They thought of all the affection they would have lavished on the defunct if they had known the end was so near. Dr. Wigram made the gesture of washing his hands.</div>

<div class="line_en">The fortnight passed quickly and Philip returned to London. He passed a sweltering August behind his screen in the costumes department, drawing in his shirt sleeves. The assistants in relays went for their holidays. In the evening Philip generally went into Hyde Park and listened to the band. Growing more accustomed to his work it tired him less, and his mind, recovering from its long stagnation, sought for fresh activity. His whole desire now was set on his uncle's death. He kept on dreaming the same dream: a telegram was handed to him one morning, early, which announced the Vicar's sudden demise, and freedom was in his grasp. When he awoke and found it was nothing but a dream he was filled with sombre rage. He occupied himself, now that the event seemed likely to happen at any time, with elaborate plans for the future. In these he passed rapidly over the year which he must spend before it was possible for him to be qualified and dwelt on the journey to Spain on which his heart was set. He read books about that country, which he borrowed from the free library, and already he knew from photographs exactly what each city looked like. He saw himself lingering in Cordova on the bridge that spanned the Gaudalquivir; he wandered through tortuous streets in Toledo and sat in churches where he wrung from El Greco the secret which he felt the mysterious painter held for him. Athelny entered into his humour, and on Sunday afternoons they made out elaborate itineraries so that Philip should miss nothing that was noteworthy. To cheat his impatience Philip began to teach himself Spanish, and in the deserted sitting-room in Harrington Street he spent an hour every evening doing Spanish exercises and puzzling out with an English translation by his side the magnificent phrases of Don Quixote. Athelny gave him a lesson once a week, and Philip learned a few sentences to help him on his journey. Mrs. Athelny laughed at them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两周很快过去，菲利普回到了伦敦。他在服装部的隔墙后面度过了一整个骄阳似火的八月，整日只穿一件衬衫，不停地涂涂画画。又一批店员轮替度假去了。下了班后，菲利普通常会去海德公园听乐队演奏。他对这份工作越来越适应，也不再觉得生活像最初那样乏味难捱。他的思想沉寂已久，试图寻找新鲜的刺激。现在，他全身心地盼着伯伯能早点咽气。几乎每晚都重复同样的梦境：某天早上，一封电报发来，说牧师已驾鹤归西。而他终于获得了解放。等他美梦醒来，发现一切都是假的，便郁郁而怒。不过，伯伯的死讯随时都可能传来，所以他干脆开始着手制定未来的详尽计划。这一年本该是他为最后取得从医资格而冲刺的一年，可他却在策划心心念念的西班牙之旅中很快度过了。他从公共图书馆借了很多描写西班牙的书，通过阅览书中的图片，几乎认得那里的每个城市了。他想象自己徜徉在哥多华的小桥上，脚下就是蜿蜒流淌的瓜达尔基维尔河。他在托莱多曲曲折折的巷弄里悠闲信步，坐在庄严的教堂中，领略到埃尔·格列柯向他传达的未解之谜。阿西尔尼也同他一起想入非非。两人花了好几个下午制定出一套周密详细的旅行计划，恐怕漏掉一处值得赏玩的景色。为了让自己躁动不安的心安稳下来，菲利普开始自学西班牙语。每晚在哈灵顿街宿舍那个空荡荡的客厅里花一个小时练习，苦苦琢磨手边的一本英译《堂·吉诃德》，研读里面宏伟美妙的语言。阿西尔尼每周给他上一节西语课，他学了几句旅行能用到的句子。阿西尔尼夫人在一旁嘲笑他俩：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Thorpe, the eldest boy, was old enough to go on the Arethusa, and Athelny regaled his family with magnificent descriptions of the appearance the lad would make when he came back in uniform for his holidays. As soon as Sally was seventeen she was to be apprenticed to a dressmaker. Athelny in his rhetorical way talked of the birds, strong enough to fly now, who were leaving the parental nest, and with tears in his eyes told them that the nest would be there still if ever they wished to return to it. A shakedown and a dinner would always be theirs, and the heart of a father would never be closed to the troubles of his children.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="家里最大的男孩索普已经到了能去当海军的年纪，阿西尔尼滔滔不绝地跟家人描述着儿子一身戎装、回家探亲时该有多么的气派。等萨莉满十七岁，就要给裁缝做学徒。阿西尔尼打着比方说，巢里的小鸟羽翼都丰满了，能出去飞翔一番了，可它们的老窝还在原地不动——说到这儿，他的眼里泪汪汪的——只要想回来，这里会永远欢迎它们。家里会一直给孩子留着一张能够临时歇息的床和一顿饱饭，而他这个做父亲的也永远会在孩子遇到麻烦时伸出援手。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But Sally, who was growing up and was to put up her hair at Christmas, stood by sometimes and listened in her grave way while her father and Philip exchanged remarks in a language she did not understand. She thought her father the most wonderful man who had ever existed, and she expressed her opinion of Philip only through her father's commendations.</div>

<div class="line_en">"You do talk, Athelny," said his wife. "I don't know what trouble they're likely to get into so long as they're steady. So long as you're honest and not afraid of work you'll never be out of a job, that's what I think, and I can tell you I shan't be sorry when I see the last of them earning their own living."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“净胡说，阿西尔尼，”他的妻子说道，“只要孩子们踏踏实实做人，我不信他们能遇上什么麻烦。只要诚实、不怕苦、不怕累，总有活儿干，我是这么觉得。等最后一个孩子也能自食其力，就算他们都离开我身边，我也不难过。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Child-bearing, hard work, and constant anxiety were beginning to tell on Mrs. Athelny; and sometimes her back ached in the evening so that she had to sit down and rest herself. Her ideal of happiness was to have a girl to do the rough work so that she need not herself get up before seven. Athelny waved his beautiful white hand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从阿西尔尼夫人身上能看到生儿育女、操劳持家和没完没了的焦虑发愁所留下的痕迹。有时晚上她背疼得没法继续干活，只能坐下来稍微放松一会儿。她心目中的幸福生活就是能有个女仆替她干点重活，这样她就不用每天七点之前起床了。阿西尔尼挥了挥他纤长白皙的手。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Ah, my Betty, we've deserved well of the state, you and I. We've reared nine healthy children, and the boys shall serve their king; the girls shall cook and sew and in their turn breed healthy children."

<div class="line_en">"Oh, don't talk to me about your socialists, I've got no patience with them," she cried. "It only means that another lot of lazy loafers will make a good thing out of the working classes.

<div class="line_en">"D'you call life a bad job?" said Athelny. "Never! We've had our ups and downs, we've had our struggles, we've always been poor, but it's been worth it, ay, worth it a hundred times I say when I look round at my children."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你说生活是个苦差事？”阿西尔尼反驳道，“绝对不是！我们经历过大起大落，在苦海里转了一圈，日子也总不见起色，但这一切都值得。啊，看看我的孩子们，这样的人生再过一百遍都值得！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You do talk, Athelny," she said, looking at him, not with anger but with scornful calm. "You've had the pleasant part of the children, I've had the bearing of them, and the bearing with them. I don't say that I'm not fond of them, now they're there, but if I had my time over again I'd remain single. Why, if I'd remained single I might have a little shop by now, and four or five hundred pounds in the bank, and a girl to do the rough work. Oh, I wouldn't go over my life again, not for something."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你说得倒简单，阿西尔尼。”她看着丈夫，脸上不见愠色，只带着淡淡轻蔑的神情，“你光知道有孩子的好，可我是生他们、养他们的人，还得受他们的气。我不是说不喜欢这些孩子，只是要是能重来，我宁愿一个人过。为什么呢？要是我只有一个人，说不定早开起一家小店了，银行里有四五百镑的积蓄，再雇个干重活儿的女仆。唉，如果没有什么好处的话，我可不愿再过一遍这样的日子。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Philip thought of the countless millions to whom life is no more than unending labour, neither beautiful nor ugly, but just to be accepted in the same spirit as one accepts the changes of the seasons. Fury seized him because it all seemed useless. He could not reconcile himself to the belief that life had no meaning and yet everything he saw, all his thoughts, added to the force of his conviction. But though fury seized him it was a joyful fury. life was not so horrible if it was meaningless, and he faced it with a strange sense of power.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这天地之间有不可计数的人，对于他们来说生活只是无休止的劳作，既谈不上美好，又称不得丑陋。春花秋月，夏蝉冬雪，四季更替似乎不过轮回一瞥。他们就是如此在生活中木然老去。人生是没有意义的，这让菲利普胸中怒火骤起。他不能接受这个事实，可自己的所见所想偏偏让他不得不信。好在这怒火也是喜悦的。人生既已如此颠簸可怖，知道它没有意义反而使人鼓足勇气、大胆面对。">查看中文翻译</div>
