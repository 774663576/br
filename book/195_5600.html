<div class="line_en">At the beginning of the last week in August Philip entered upon his duties in the `district.' They were arduous, for he had to attend on an average three confinements a day. The patient had obtained a `card' from the hospital some time before; and when her time came it was taken to the porter by a messenger, generally a little girl, who was then sent across the road to the house in which Philip lodged. At night the porter, who had a latch-key, himself came over and awoke Philip. It was mysterious then to get up in the darkness and walk through the deserted streets of the South Side. At those hours it was generally the husband who brought the card. If there had been a number of babies before he took it for the most part with surly indifference, but if newly married he was nervous and then sometimes strove to allay his anxiety by getting drunk. Often there was a mile or more to walk, during which Philip and the messenger discussed the conditions of labour and the cost of living; Philip learnt about the various trades which were practised on that side of the river. He inspired confidence in the people among whom he was thrown, and during the long hours that he waited in a stuffy room, the woman in labour lying on a large bed that took up half of it, her mother and the midwife talked to him as naturally as they talked to one another. The circumstances in which he had lived during the last two years had taught him several things about the life of the very poor, which it amused them to find he knew; and they were impressed because he was not deceived by their little subterfuges. He was kind, and he had gentle hands, and he did not lose his temper. They were pleased because he was not above drinking a cup of tea with them, and when the dawn came and they were still waiting they offered him a slice of bread and dripping; he was not squeamish and could eat most things now with a good appetite. Some of the houses he went to, in filthy courts off a dingy street, huddled against one another without light or air, were merely squalid; but others, unexpectedly, though dilapidated, with worm-eaten floors and leaking roofs, had the grand air: you found in them oak balusters exquisitely carved, and the walls had still their panelling. These were thickly inhabited. One family lived in each room, and in the daytime there was the incessant noise of children playing in the court. The old walls were the breeding-place of vermin; the air was so foul that often, feeling sick, Philip had to light his pipe. The people who dwelt here lived from hand to mouth. Babies were unwelcome, the man received them with surly anger, the mother with despair; it was one more mouth to feed, and there was little enough wherewith to feed those already there. Philip often discerned the wish that the child might be born dead or might die quickly. He delivered one woman of twins (a source of humour to the facetious) and when she was told she burst into a long, shrill wail of misery. Her mother said outright:</div>

<div class="line_en">Philip caught sight of the husband's face as he looked at the tiny pair lying side by side, and there was a ferocious sullenness in it which startled him. He felt in the family assembled there a hideous resentment against those poor atoms who had come into the world unwished for; and he had a suspicion that if he did not speak firmly an `accident' would occur. Accidents occurred often; mothers `overlay' their babies, and perhaps errors of diet were not always the result of carelessness.</div>

<div class="line_en">The great difficulty was to keep the mothers in bed for ten days, which was the minimum upon which the hospital practice insisted. It was awkward to look after the family, no one would see to the children without payment, and the husband tumbled because his tea was not right when he came home tired from his work and hungry. Philip had heard that the poor helped one another, but woman after woman complained to him that she could not get anyone in to clean up and see to the children's dinner without paying for the service, and she could not afford to pay. By listening to the women as they talked and by chance remarks from which he could deduce much that was left unsaid, Philip learned how little there was in common between the poor and the classes above them. They did not envy their betters, for the life was too different, and they had an ideal of ease which made the existence of the middle-classes seem formal and stiff; moreover, they had a certain contempt for them because they were soft and did not work with their hands. The proud merely wished to be left alone, but the majority looked upon the well-to-do as people to be exploited; they knew what to say in order to get such advantages as the charitable put at their disposal, and they accepted benefits as a right which came to them from the folly of their superiors and their own astuteness. They bore the curate with contemptuous indifference, but the district visitor excited their bitter hatred. She came in and opened your windows without so much as a by your leave or with your leave, `and me with my bronchitis, enough to give me my death of cold;' she poked her nose into corners, and if she didn't say the place was dirty you saw what she thought right enough, `an' it's all very well for them as 'as servants, but I'd like to see what she'd make of 'er room if she 'ad four children, and 'ad to do the cookin', and mend their clothes, and wash them.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最困难的事是保证新生儿的母亲能卧床休息十天，这是医院按惯例规定的最少期限了。可操持家务哪里是件轻巧活儿？想找人看孩子就必须支付工资，况且要是在丈夫工作一天，又饿又累地回到家之前没准备好茶点，那他一定会雷霆大发。菲利普听说这些穷人家的女人经常会互相帮忙，但实际上，她们总是挨个跟菲利普大吐苦水，抱怨没人愿意帮着收拾屋子、拉扯孩子，又请不起帮佣。从这些女人说出口和没有说出口的话里，菲利普发现他们的生活和社会上等阶级堪称天差地别。他们从不嫉妒那些富裕人家，因为清楚自己和别人没有可比性。他们有种特别的阿Q精神，中产阶级的生活在他们眼里只能是刻板、枯燥，毫无幸福可言。甚至他们还同情中产阶级，觉得那些人软弱无能，无法自食其力。这些人中，骨头硬些的只想独善其身，不愿别人来打搅自己。可大多数都想从有钱人那里揩点油。他们深知说些什么才能把乐善好施之人哄得妥妥帖帖，一旦获得施舍还觉得这是天经地义，谁让有钱人都是傻子，而他们却好生精明呢！副牧师上门拜访时，他们总是爱答不理。教区的探访员一来，他们又没个好脸色。探访员是个娘们儿，一进屋就把窗户打开，连句“劳驾”“打扰了”都不说。她一边嚷着“我有气管炎，这天气要冻死人了”，一边在屋里走来走去，东摸西瞧，连犄角旮旯也不放过。就算她不明说这房子很脏，你也能大概猜出她心里在想些什么了。“哎唷，她们雇得起佣人，当然能把家拾掇得干干净净了。要是她们也养着四个孩子，还得负责做饭、缝洗衣服，我倒要看看能把家收拾成什么样。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The man ate stolidly some mess which had been stewing in a sauce-pan against his coming; he stared at his plate; his wife looked at him two or three times, with little startled glances, and then quite silently began to cry. The builder was an uncouth little fellow with a rough, weather-beaten face and a long white scar on his forehead; he had large, stubbly hands. Presently he pushed aside his plate as if he must give up the effort to force himself to eat, and turned a fixed gaze out of the window. The room was at the top of the house, at the back, and one saw nothing but sullen clouds. The silence seemed heavy with despair. Philip felt that there was nothing to be said, he could only go; and as he walked away wearily, for he had been up most of the night, his heart was filled with rage against the cruelty of the world. He knew the hopelessness of the search for work and the desolation which is harder to bear than hunger. He was thankful not to have to believe in God, for then such a condition of things would be intolerable; one could reconcile oneself to existence only because it was meaningless.</div>

<div class="line_en">It seemed to Philip that the people who spent their time in helping the poorer classes erred because they sought to remedy things which would harass them if themselves had to endure them without thinking that they did not in the least disturb those who were used to them. The poor did not want large airy rooms; they suffered from cold, for their food was not nourishing and their circulation bad; space gave them a feeling of chilliness, and they wanted to burn as little coal as need be; there was no hardship for several to sleep in one room, they preferred it; they were never alone for a moment, from the time they were born to the time they died, and loneliness oppressed them; they enjoyed the promiscuity in which they dwelt, and the constant noise of their surroundings pressed upon their ears unnoticed. They did not feel the need of taking a bath constantly, and Philip often heard them speak with indignation of the necessity to do so with which they were faced on entering the hospital: it was both an affront and a discomfort. They wanted chiefly to be left alone; then if the man was in regular work life went easily and was not without its pleasures: there was plenty of time for gossip, after the day's work a glass of beer was very good to drink, the streets were a constant source of entertainment, if you wanted to read there was Reynolds' or The News of the World; `but there, you couldn't make out 'ow the time did fly, the truth was and that's a fact, you was a rare one for reading when you was a girl, but what with one thing and another you didn't get no time now not even to read the paper.'</div>

It was a sunny room with two windows that reached to the floor; it had been the parlour of a house which at one time was if not fashionable at least respectable: it might have been inhabited fifty years before by a well-to-do tradesman or an officer on half pay. 'Erb had been a football player before he married, and there were photographs on the wall of various teams in self-conscious attitudes, with neatly plastered hair, the captain seated proudly in the middle holding a cup. There were other signs of prosperity: photographs of the relations of 'Erb and his wife in Sunday clothes; on the chimney-piece an elaborate arrangement of shells stuck on a miniature rock; and on each side mugs, `A present from Southend' in Gothic letters, with pictures of a pier and a parade on them. 'Erb was something of a character; he was a non-union man and expressed himself with indignation at the efforts of the union to force him to join. The union wasn't no good to him, he never found no difficulty in getting work, and there was good wages for anyone as 'ad a head on his shoulders and wasn't above puttin' 'is 'and to anything as come 'is way. Polly was timorous. If she was 'im she'd join the union, the last time there was a strike she was expectin' 'im to be brought back in an ambulance every time he went out. She turned to Philip.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="波莉一阵手忙脚乱。厄尔布就是这样想一出是一出，让人永远也猜不到他下一秒准备做什么。波莉取来一个盘子，用围裙飞快地抹了抹，又从五斗柜里拿出副新刀叉。她一向把最好的餐具用最好的衣服裹得严严实实，藏在柜子里。桌上放了一壶烈性啤酒，厄尔布给菲利普倒了一杯。他想多给菲利普切点牛排，可菲利普坚持要一人一半。阳光透过两扇落地窗暖暖地照进来，这间客厅的装潢在过去即使算不上时髦，起码也是非常体面的了。也许五十年前这里的房客是位商业大亨，或是哪个军官以半价租了下来。厄尔布婚前曾是个足球运动员，客厅墙上挂着他在不同球队效力时的照片。球员们一个个头发梳得齐整，满脸青涩。队长手拿奖杯大模大样地坐在中间。房间里还有一些小摆设，这个小康家庭的富足程度从中可窥见一斑。有几张厄尔布的亲戚和夫人穿着节日盛装的照片，壁炉架上还有一块做工精致、沾满贝壳装饰的观赏石，石头两边是一对杯子，上面印着码头和军队的图片，还有用哥特式字体写的“索森德赠”。厄尔布这人有点个性，他坚决不入工会，谁逼着他参加，他就对谁翻脸。工会对他来说没什么用处，他从来不愁找不着工作。凡是脖子上长着颗脑袋，干活不挑，什么都肯做，就肯定能挣到大钱。而波莉是个胆小的女人，换作她是厄尔布的话，肯定早就进工会了。上次工人们闹罢工，每次厄尔布出门，波莉都提心吊胆地害怕他下一刻就被急救车送回来。她转身对菲利普说：">查看中文翻译</div>
