<div class="line_en">At Plumstead, the archdeacon was in a state of misery. Not only had Mr Quiverful, rather than Mr Harding, been appointed warden of Hiram's Hospital, it also seemed quite possible that Mr Slope would become dean, and marry Eleanor Bold. There was yet another reason for anxiety. Dr Grantly's excellent and respected friend, Francis Arabin, of whose qualities he had boasted so loudly, was misbehaving himself. People were now beginning to talk of his repeated visits to the signora. This was not at all what was expected of the vicar of St Ewold's.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在普拉姆斯特德，执事长痛苦不堪。不仅哈丁先生在海勒姆养老院的院长职位归了奎沃夫先生，斯洛普先生似乎还很有可能成为教士长，娶埃莉诺·博尔德为妻。除此之外，格兰特利博士还有一件烦心事。他那位优秀的、受人尊重的朋友弗朗西斯·阿拉宾行为不端，而他一直大肆吹捧阿拉宾如何品德高尚。如今，人们开始议论阿拉宾对内罗尼太太的频繁拜访。这完全不符合大家对圣埃沃兹代牧的期望。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“天哪！”执事长大叫一声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The archdeacon was so shocked that he almost dropped his glass. Why would a vicar earning less than ￡200 a year not wish to gain one of the most desirable positions in the Church, at an income of ￡1200? But Mr Harding explained to him and Susan, over and over again, that he would be incapable of doing the job properly, and that at his age he did not want any sort of promotion. In spite of their protests, he remained firm.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="执事长大惊失色，手里的杯子差一点儿就掉在了地上。一个年薪不到两百英镑的代牧为什么不愿意接受教会里最让人眼馋的职位，不愿意接受一千两百英镑的年薪？但是，哈丁先生翻来覆去地向他和苏珊解释，说自己胜任不了这份工作，他这把年纪也不想升什么职了。尽管夫妻俩一再反对，他的态度还是很坚决。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And after they had both congratulated Mr Harding, they all sat down to dinner. The archdeacon's joy was uncontrollable. It was not until they had finished eating and the servants had left, that Mr Harding found the opportunity to say, rather nervously, "It's very kind of the prime minister, and I'm most grateful for the offer, but I'm afraid I can't accept it."</div>

<div class="line_en">Eleanor was a little surprised at the invitation, but accepted it, and arrived at Ullathorne the day before her father was offered the post of dean. Since her interview with Madeline, she had done little else but think about Mr Arabin, and she was hoping to see him at Ullathorne. If only they could meet, and speak to each other!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个邀请让埃莉诺有些惊讶，但她还是应邀前往，并在她父亲得到教士长提名的前一天来到了乌拉索恩。自从跟马德琳见过面之后，她就一心只想着阿拉宾先生，也希望能在乌拉索恩见到他。要是他俩能碰上面，说上话，那就好了！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At Ullathorne, the squire's sister had also heard the stories about Mr Arabin and the signora. Miss Thorne was of the opinion that all vicars should be married, in order to avoid this kind of unpleasantness, and with her usual good-hearted energy she set to work to find a wife for Mr Arabin. In looking through the list of her unmarried friends who might possibly want a husband, and who had the right qualities to be a vicar's wife, she could think of no one more suitable than Mrs Bold. So, losing no time, she invited Mrs Bold and her small son to come and stay for a month or two at Ullathorne. "We'll have Mr Arabin too," said Miss Thorne to herself, "and in twelve or eighteen months' time, if all goes well, Mrs Bold will take up residence at St Ewold's." And the kind-hearted lady praised herself for her matchmaking.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在乌拉索恩，乡绅的姐姐也听说了阿拉宾先生和内罗尼太太之间的事。索恩小姐认为，所有的代牧都应该成家，为的就是避免这一类不愉快的事件。于是她使出平常乐于助人的劲头，开始想办法为阿拉宾先生物色一个妻子。她挨个查了一遍自己认识的单身女子，看看哪些人有可能想找个丈夫，自身的资质又适合做一名代牧的妻子。她想不出还有谁比博尔德太太更加合适。因此，她片刻都没耽搁，立刻邀请博尔德太太和她年幼的儿子来乌拉索恩住上一两个月。“我们得把阿拉宾先生也请来。”索恩小姐暗自思量，“一切顺利的话，再过上一年或一年半的时间，博尔德太太就会在圣埃沃兹定居了。”这位古道热肠的女士对自己这番牵线搭桥颇为自许。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This was another disappointment for the archdeacon. Nothing would have suited him better than to have his father-in-law as dean, but it was impossible to change Mr Harding's mind.</div>

After lunch Mr Arabin returned to his church duties, and Eleanor and Miss Thorne took a walk together.</div>

<div class="line_en">When they returned, Eleanor was left alone in the sitting room, and just as it was getting dark, Mr Arabin came in. It was a beautiful autumn afternoon, and Eleanor was sitting near the window to get the last of the daylight for her reading. Mr Arabin stood with his back to the fire and his hands in his pockets, making a few ordinary remarks about the weather.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“那是因为您对这个世界的见识比年少时多了。不过，我们不该根据自己的见识来下判断——我们的见识实在是太少太少了。”阿拉宾先生拨弄着口袋里的硬币，两人很不自在地沉默了一阵。接着，他开始心神不宁地在屋子里走来走去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was only for a minute that they stood like that, but it was a minute that they would remember for ever. Eleanor was sure now that she was loved. But why did he not speak to her? Could it be that he looked to her to make the first sign? And he, although he knew very little of women, even he knew that he was loved. He had only to ask, and it would all be his own, this inexpressible loveliness, this bright and loving nature which had so attracted him from the first. She must love him! Otherwise she would never allow her hand to remain so long within his own. He had only to ask. Ah, but that was the difficulty!</div>

<div class="line_en">So it was arranged between them that they would travel to London together the following morning, to try to persuade the prime minister to appoint Mr Arabin, instead of Mr Harding.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mr Slope was in his room at the bishop's palace, when he received a note from his friend Sir Nicholas, informing him that he would not be offered the post of dean. He did not give way to despair, however, but sat down quietly to make a new plan for his future. He counted up his money, and then he wrote a letter to a rich factory-owner's wife in London, who, as he well knew, had entertained and encouraged serious young clergymen in the past.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯洛普先生在主教宅邸自己的房间里，接到了朋友尼古拉斯爵士写来的信，得知自己不会被任命为教士长。可他不甘绝望，而是默默地坐下来，重新为将来打算。他统计了自己的财产，然后给伦敦一位富有的工厂主夫人写了一封信，因为他清楚地知道，这位夫人曾经款待一些作风严肃的年轻神职人员，还挑逗过他们。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And then slowly, gradually and cleverly Mr Harding proposed his own new plan. Why should Mr Arabin not be the new dean? Slowly, gradually and thoughtfully Dr Grantly was persuaded to accept the idea.

<div class="line_cn" title="然后，哈丁先生慢慢地、一步一步地、巧妙地提出了自己的新想法。为什么不让阿拉宾先生来担任新任教士长呢？格兰特利博士则陷入了沉思，慢慢地、一步一步地被他说服，接受了这个想法。他们和主教之间的难题由此可以得到完美的解决。此外，阿拉宾当上教士长之后，执事长在巴彻斯特的影响力会大幅提升。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A few moments later a servant appeared, to ask him to go to the bishop's study at once. Mr Slope waited ten minutes to prove his independence, and then went to the bishop's room. As he had expected, Mrs Proudie was there with her husband.</div>
