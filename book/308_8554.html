<div class="line_en">"We may get a line on the blackmailing part of the business, if on nothing else," he declared jubilantly. "He's a rough customer, this fellow, by what I heard over the phone. Takes dope, too. We ought to find it easy to get what we want out of him. If there was the shadow of a motive, nothing's more likely than that he killed Mr Ackroyd. But in that case, why is young Paton keeping out of the way. The whole thing's a muddle -- that's what it is. By the way, M. Poirot, you were quite right about those fingerprints. They were Mr Ackroyd's own. I had rather the same idea myself, but I dismissed it as hardly feasible."</div>

<div class="line_en">On arrival at Liverpool I was surpised to find that Poirot was welcomed with acclamation. Superintendent Hayes, who met us, had worked with Poirot over some case long ago, and had evidently an exaggerated opinion of his powers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一到利物浦，波洛受到的热情接待便令我吃了一惊。前来迎接我们是海耶斯警司，多年前曾和波洛合作办过案。他把波洛的侦破能力捧上了天。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The superintendent closed one eye knowingly. "Very glad to have you, sir. You've got permission to do anything you please.

<div class="line_en">He was a young fellow, I should say not more than twenty-two or three. Tall, thin, with slightly shaking hands, and the evidences of considerable physical strength somewhat run to seed. His hair was dark, but his eyes were blue and shifty, seldom meeting a glance squarely. I had all along cherished the illusion that there was something familiar about the figure I had met that night, but if this were indeed he, I was completely mistaken. He did not remind me in the least of anyone I knew.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这人很年轻，估计最多二十二三岁。高个子，很瘦，两手有点哆嗦；健康状态良好，但此刻疲态尽显。他一头黑发，眼珠子却是蓝色的，目光闪烁，不敢直视我们。我记得那天晚上遇到的陌生人给我似曾相识的感觉，但如果是面前这人，那我当时肯定搞错了，我完全想不出认识的人当中有谁和眼前之人存在相似之处。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Then you've nothing to keep me here for," said Kent. "I was away from Fernly Park by twenty-five minutes past nine. You can ask at the Dog and Whistle. That's a saloon about a mile out of Fernly on the road to Cranchester. I kicked up a bit of a row there, I remember. As near as nothing to quarter to ten, it was. How about that?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那你们就没理由关着我，”肯特说，“我九点二十五分就离开芬利庄园了，你们可以去‘狗哨’问。那个酒吧在去克兰切斯特的路上，离芬利庄园起码一英里。我还记得在那儿跟人吵了一架，时间差不多就是九点四十五分。怎么样？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Under certain circumstances, I can imagine he might be," said Poirot very deliberately. "Under certain circumstances, you comprehend." There was so much meaning in his voice as to surprise the two police officers. As for Charles Kent, he flushed a brick red, and for a moment I thought he was going to spring at Poirot. He thought better of it, however, and turned away with a kind of laugh.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“基于某种特殊原因，有这个可能，”波洛特意又重复一遍，“某种特殊原因，你明白我的意思。”他话里有话，意味深长，两位警官听得莫名其妙。查尔斯·肯特则面红耳赤，我一时以为他要扑向波洛。不过他终究稳住了阵脚，反倒露出一副似笑非笑的表情。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="对方眼睛一瞪。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Why's that? Because of my name? What's that to do with it? Is a man whose name is Kent bound to be born in that particular county?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"We'll verify that statement," remarked Raglan. "I don't think he's lying, though. But he's got to come clean with a statement as to what he was doing at Fernly. It looks to me as though we'd got our blackmailer all right. On the other hand, granted his story's correct, he couldn't have had anything to do with the actual murder. He'd got ten pounds on him when he was arrested -- rather a large sum. I fancy that forty pounds went to him -- the numbers of the notes didn't correspond, but of course he'd have changed them first thing. Mr Ackroyd must have given him the money, and he made off with it as fast as possible. What was that about Kent being his birthplace? What's that got to do with it?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“得去核实一下他的话，”拉格伦说，“不过我看他没撒谎。然而他总该交代清楚去芬利庄园干了些什么，才能洗清嫌疑。我看敲诈犯我们是逮着了。另一方面，如果他刚才说的全部属实，那他就和谋杀不沾边了。被捕时他身上有十英镑，数额相当可观，估计那四十英镑就落在他手里——虽然钞票编号不对，但他搞到钱后第一件事肯定是去兑换掉。他肯定是从艾克罗伊德先生那里拿到钱，然后脚底抹油就溜。他是否出生在肯特郡重要吗？和案子有什么关系？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You mock yourself at me," said Poirot, smiling; "but never mind. The old ones they laugh last sometimes, when the young, clever ones do not laugh at all." And nodding his head at them in a sage manner he walked out into the street.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“您是在取笑我，”波洛笑道，“不过没关系，有时笑到最后的反而是老家伙们，到时候聪明的年轻人却笑不出来了。”他煞有介事地朝他们点头致意，往街上走去。">查看中文翻译</div>
