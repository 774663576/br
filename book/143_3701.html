<div class="line_en">Michael, Peter Clemenza and Don Domenico had an early supper together. If they were to make the dawn meeting hour, the operation to collect Guiliano would have to start at dusk. They went over the plan again and Domenico approved. He added one detail: Michael was not to be armed. If something went wrong and the carabinieri or Security Police arrested them, no charges could be brought against Michael, and he could leave Sicily no matter what happened.</div>

<div class="line_en">They had changed their plans. The plane at Mazzara del Vallo in which they had planned to fly to Africa would be used as a decoy; instead the escape to Africa would be by boat. Clemenza had argued for this, saying that he could control the road and guard the boat with his men, but he could not control the small airfield. There was too much ground area in the approaches and the plane was too fragile; it could become a deathtrap while still on the ground. Speed was not as important as deception, and the sea was easier to hide in than the sky. Also provisions could be made for transferring to another boat; you couldn't change planes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们改变了原先的计划。原计划从马扎拉德瓦洛飞往非洲的那架飞机将是个幌子，他们要乘船前往非洲。是克莱门扎主张这样做的，说这样他可以派自己的人去控制道路，并保护这条船，但他控制不了那个小机场。前往机场要通过的地域太大，而且飞机非常容易受到攻击；它可能还没有起飞，就成了一个死亡陷阱。伪装比速度更重要，而且在海上比在天上易于隐蔽。此外，还可以作改乘另一条船的准备；在天上要换乘飞机是不可能的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Clemenza had been busy during the day dispatching some men and cars to an assembly point on the road to Castelvetrano; others to secure the town of Mazzara del Vallo. He had sent them at intervals of an hour; he did not want spies observing the unusual movement of a convoy going through the villa gates. The cars went off in different directions to further confuse any observers. Meanwhile the motor launch was making its way around the southwestern point of Sicily to lie out over the horizon until the dawn started to break, when it would zoom into the port of Mazzara del Vallo. Cars and men would be waiting for them. From there it would not be more than a half-hour drive to Castelvetrano despite the swing they would have to take north to meet the Trapani road that led to where Pisciotta would intercept them.</div>

<div class="line_en">Michael lay down on one of the bunks. He could hear Clemenza snoring and was filled with amazed admiration that the man could actually sleep at such a time. Michael thought that in twenty-four hours he would be in Tunis and twelve hours after that he would be home with his family. After two years of exile he would have all the options of a free man, no longer on the run from the police, not subject to the rule of his protectors. He could do exactly what he wanted to do. But only if he got through the next thirty-six hours. As he fantasized about what he would do his first days in America, the gentle roll of the boat relaxed him and he fell into a dreamless sleep.</div>

<div class="line_en">Inspector Federico Velardi, head of the Security Police of Sicily, felt the virtuous triumph of a man who has waited patiently, believing always in a God who would finally bring order into his universe, and finally received his reward. For nearly a year, under the direct and secret orders of Minister Trezza, he had helped Guiliano escape the carabinieri and his own flying squads. He had met with the murderous Stefano Andolini, Fra Diav o lo. For that year Inspector Velardi had, in effect, been a subordinate of Don Croce Malo.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a beautiful morning; the fields alongside the road were carpeted with flowers. He was early for his appointment so he stopped by one of the roadside shrines for a cigarette and then knelt in front of the padlocked box that held the statue of Saint Rosalia. His prayer was simple and practical, a plea to the Saint to protect him from his enemies. On the coming Sunday he would confess his sins to Father Beniamino and take Communion. Now the radiant sun warmed his bare head; the flower-perfumed air was so heavy it washed his nostrils and palate clean of nicotine and he was enormously hungry. He promised himself a good breakfast in Palermo's finest restaurant after his meeting with Inspector Velardi.</div>

<div class="line_en">Velardi was from the north of Italy, where people made something of themselves through education, a respect for the social contract, a belief in law and government. Velardi's service years in Sicily had instilled in him contempt and deep hatred for the Sicilian people, high and low. The rich had no social conscience and kept down the poor by their criminal conspiracy with the Mafia. The Mafia, which pretended to protect the poor, hired themselves out to the rich to keep down those poor. The peasants were too proud, had such egos that they gloried in murder though they might spend the rest of their lives in prison.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="韦拉尔迪出生在意大利北部。那里的人们通过教育使自己成才，他们遵守社会契约，相信法律和政府。在西西里工作的这些年，他逐渐对所有的西西里人都产生了鄙弃和仇恨的心理。这里的富人没有社会良知，与黑手党狼狈为奸，欺压穷人。黑手党打着保护穷人的幌子，帮着富人欺压穷人。这里的农民太傲气，他们具有以杀人为荣的自我意识，尽管他们可能因此而在大牢里度过余生。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">To Velardi's astonishment Minister Trezza himself had given the order that all those people who had been given the red-bordered passes signed by the Minister, those all-powerful passes that enabled the users to pass through roadblocks, to carry arms, to be immune to routine arrests, were to be detained in solitary confinement. Those passes had to be gathered up. Especially those issued to Aspanu Pisciotta and Stefano Andolini.</div>

<div class="line_en">The night's solitude in his cell, thinking about his strange arrest, had convinced Andolini he was in mortal danger. When he entered, Velardi was striding up and down the room, his blue eyes flashing, obviously in a temper. Stefano Andolini was cold as ice. He observed everything -- the Captain and four police sergeants at the alert, the pistol at Velardi's hip. He knew that the Inspector had always hated him, and he hated the Inspector no less. If he could talk Velardi into getting rid of the guards, he might at least kill him before he was killed himself. So he said, "I'll talk, but not with these other sbirri here." Sbirri was the vulgar and insulting idiom for the Security Police.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="安多里尼在牢房里被单独关了一夜，他仔细考虑了这次奇怪的逮捕，认为自己肯定是凶多吉少了。他进来之后，发现韦拉尔迪正在办公室来回大步走动，那双蓝眼睛露出凶光，显然是在发脾气。斯特凡·安多里尼冷若冰霜。他把一切都看在眼里——那个上尉和四名警察处于高度戒备，韦拉尔迪腰间挎着手枪。他知道这个警督历来对他视如寇仇，而他对这个警督也恨之入骨。如果他能够让韦拉尔迪同意把卫兵撤下去，他起码能在被他们打死之前先把这个警督干掉。他说：“我招，但是这些喽啰不能在这里。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At that moment, anger blinding his instinct for survival, Stefano Andolini grabbed the pistol out of the Inspector's belt holster and tried to fire. In that same instant the police officer drew his own gun and fired four shots into Andolini's body. Andolini was hurled against the far wall and then lay on the floor. The white shirt was stained completely red and, Velardi thought, it matched his hair quite nicely. He reached down and took the pistol from Andolini's hand as other policemen rushed into the room. He complimented the Captain on his alertness, and then in full view of the officer he loaded his pistol with the bullets he had emptied out of it before the meeting. He did not want his Captain to get delusions of grandeur, that he had actually saved the life of a careless head of the Security Police.</div>

<div class="line_en">The three wide-bodied touring cars were moving in the pale, early sunlight through a countryside almost unchanged since the birth of Christ. Ancient aqueducts and pipes spouted water over the fields. It was already warm and humid, and the air was filled with the smell of flowers beginning to rot in the heat of the Sicilian summer. They were passing through the Selinunte, the ruins of the ancient Greek city, and Michael could see from time to time the crumbling columns of marble temples scattered over Western Sicily by the Greek colonists more than two thousand years ago. These columns loomed eerily in the yellow light, their fragments of roof dripping blackly like rain against the blue sky. The rich black earth foamed up against walls of granite cliffs. There was not a house, not an animal, not a man to be seen. It was a landscape created by the slash of a giant sword.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在清晨惨白的阳光下，三辆宽体旅游车行驶在乡村道路上。这里的乡村自基督降生以来几乎没有发生过什么变化。古老的高架水槽和水管灌溉着这里的土地。天气温暖而潮湿，空气中弥漫着花香。在西西里夏季的炎热中，这些花儿已经开始凋谢。他们在古希腊城堡塞利农特遗址中穿行，迈克尔不时地看见一些神庙废墟上破碎的大理石柱。这些神庙是希腊殖民者两千多年前在西西里西部建立的。在浅黄色的光线中，这些石柱显得非常怪异，屋顶碎片就像蓝天上的雨点，随时有可能落下。在花岗岩峭壁的映衬下，是一片延绵起伏的肥沃黑土地。看不见一户人家，看不见一只动物，也看不见一个人。这一地貌特征是大自然鬼斧神工的造化。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then they swung north to hit the Trapani-Castelvetrano road. And now Michael and Clemenza were more alert; it was along this road that Pisciotta would intercept them and bring them to Guiliano. Michael felt an intense excitement. The three touring cars went more slowly now. Clemenza had a machine pistol lying on the seat on his left side so he could bring it up quickly over the car door. His hands were positioned on it. The sun had climbed into its rightful dominance, and its rays were a hot gold. The cars kept slowly on; they were almost upon the town of Castelvetrano.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着他们掉头向北，驶上特拉帕尼－卡斯特尔维特拉诺公路。这时，迈克尔和克莱门扎更加警惕了；皮肖塔将在这条路上拦住他们，并把他们带到吉里安诺那里去。迈克尔感到异常激动。三辆旅行车放慢了速度。克莱门扎把冲锋手枪放在左侧的座位上，这样他随时可以把它拿起来对着车门外。他的两只手就放在枪上。太阳已经升得老高，金色的阳光带着几分灼热。汽车保持慢速行驶，他们几乎就快到卡斯特尔维特拉诺镇了。">查看中文翻译</div>

They were now on the outskirts of Castelvetrano, ascending a hilly road, and stopping so that they could look down the main street of the town lying below them. From their high vantage point Michael could see the road from Palermo clogged with vehicles -- military vehicles; the streets were swarming with carabinieri in their black uniforms with white piping. There was the wail of many sirens that did not seem to scatter the crowds of people in the main street. Overhead two small planes were circling.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Wait," Michael said, now seeing the cart and donkey toiling slowly up the hill toward them. The driver was an old man with a straw hat pulled down tight around his head. The cart was painted with legends on the wheels, the shafts, and the sides. It halted alongside of them. The driver's face was wrinkled and showed no expression, and his arms, incongruously muscled, were bare to his shoulders, for he wore only a black vest over his wide canvas trousers. He came abreast of their car and said, "Don Clemenza, is that you?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“等一等。”迈克尔说。他看见一辆驴拉的大车正朝他们这边艰难缓慢地爬着坡。赶车的是个老人，头上扣着一顶草帽。车轮、车辕和车身上都画着传奇人物故事。大车在他们旁边停下。车夫那道道皱纹的脸上毫无表情。他下身穿一条肥大的粗布裤子，上身套了件黑坎肩，肌肉发达的手臂一直裸露到肩膀。他走到他们的车前说：“您是克莱门扎先生吧？”">查看中文翻译</div>

He was a small wiry man with a sad face, and because of the heat he had taken off his braided cap and was wiping his partially bald head with a white handkerchief.

Captain Perenze, Colonel Luca's chief of staff, was giving interviews on the radio to a panel of journalists. He told how Guiliano had started to run and he, Captain Perenze, had followed him and cornered him in the courtyard.
