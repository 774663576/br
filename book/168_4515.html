<div class="line_en">Jon took the horse in hand and held him still, so he could count the giants emerging from the blowing snow and pale mists that swirled along the Milkwater. He was well beyond fifty when Tormund said something and he lost the count. There must be hundreds. No matter how many went past, they just seemed to keep coming.</div>

<div class="line_en">The giants swayed slowly atop the mammoths as they rode past two by two. Jon's garron shied, frightened by such strangeness, but whether it was the mammoths or their riders that scared him it was hard to say. Even Ghost backed off a step, baring his teeth in a silent snarl. The direwolf was big, but the mammoths were a deal bigger, and there were many and more of them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="巨人们坐在长毛象背上缓缓摇晃，两骑一排地经过。琼恩的矮马见此奇景惊恐后退，不知是长毛象还是骑手吓着了它。就连白灵也退后一步，呲牙露齿，无声咆哮。冰原狼固然身材硕大，但和长毛象相比，却是小巫见大巫，更何况后者数量众多。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In Old Nan's stories, giants were outsized men who lived in colossal castles, fought with huge swords, and walked about in boots a boy could hide in. These were something else, more bearlike than human, and as wooly as the mammoths they rode. Seated, it was hard to say how big they truly were, Ten feet tall maybe, or twelve, Jon thought. Maybe fourteen, but no taller. Their sloping chests might have passed for those of men, but their arms hung down too far, and their lower torsos looked half again as wide as their upper. Their legs were shorter than their arms, but very thick, and they wore no boots at all; their feet were broad splayed things, hard and horny and black. Neckless, their huge heavy heads thrust forward from between their shoulder blades, and their faces were squashed and brutal. Rats' eyes no larger than beads were almost lost within folds of horny flesh, but they snuffled constantly, smelling as much as they saw.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在老奶妈的故事中，巨人是体型超大的人类，住在巨型城堡里，用巨剑战斗，光穿的鞋就足以让人类男孩躲在里面。然而眼前这些生物却和她的描述不大相符，应该说更像熊，和跨下的长毛象一样多毛。由于巨人们都坐着，所以很难判断确切高度。或许十尺，或许十二尺，琼恩心想，也可能十四尺，但不会再高。他们隆起的胸膛和人类差不多，胳膊很长，悬吊而下，下臂又比上臂宽一半。而他们的腿比手短，很粗，且根本不穿鞋，因为脚掌宽阔，又黑又硬，长满老茧。由于没脖子，他们沉重的大脑袋从肩胛骨间向前伸出，脸则扁平而凶残，老鼠般的小眼睛不过珠子大小，陷在角质皮肤中几乎看不见，可他们鼻子很灵，边走边嗅。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">One of the giants coming up on them looked older than the rest. His pelt was grey and streaked with white, and the mammoth he rode, larger than any of the others, was grey and white as well. Tormund shouted something up to him as he passed, harsh clanging words in a tongue that Jon did not comprehend. The giant's lips split apart to reveal a mouth full of huge square teeth, and he made a sound half belch and half rumble. After a moment Jon realized he was laughing. The mammoth turned its massive head to regard the two of them briefly, one huge tusk passing over the top of Jon's head as the beast lumbered by, leaving huge footprints in the soft mud and fresh snow along the river. The giant shouted down something in the same coarse tongue that Tormund had used.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="朝他们走来的巨人中，有一个看上去比其余的年长。他的毛发乃是灰色，间有白色条纹，跨下的长毛象也比同类要大，一样灰白相间。他经过时，托蒙德用某种刺耳铿锵的语言喊了些什么，琼恩无法领会，巨人张开嘴巴，露出满口结实的大牙齿，发出半象打嗝、半象轰鸣的声音。过了好一会儿，琼恩才意识到他在笑。那头长毛象转过巨大的脑袋，短暂地瞥了他俩一眼，笨拙地走来，在河边的烂泥浆和新雪地上留下硕大的足印，一根巨齿从琼恩头上掠过。这时，巨人用托蒙德刚才所说的粗犷语言冲下面叫喊。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They're not wearing skins, Jon realized. That's hair. Shaggy pelts covered their bodies, thick below the waist, sparser above. The stink that came off them was choking, but perhaps that was the mammoths. And foramun blew the Horn of Winter, and woke giants from the earth. He looked for great swords ten feet long, but saw only clubs. Most were just the limbs of dead trees, some still trailing shattered branches. A few had stone balls lashed to the ends to make colossal mauls. The song never says if the horn can put them back to sleep.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们并非披着兽皮，琼恩意识到，只是毛发很长。乱蓬蓬的毛发覆盖身体，腰部以下较密，以上则较稀疏，散发的臭气令人窒息——当然，气味也可能源于长毛象。在歌谣里，乔曼吹响冬之号角，从地底将巨人们唤醒。眼前的巨人没有装备十尺长的巨剑，只看到棍棒，其中多数是枯树枝干做成，拖着残破的分枝，有几根末端还绑了石球，当槌子用。歌谣里可没说号角能否让他们重回睡眠。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jon wheeled and followed Tormund back toward the head of the column, his new cloak hanging heavy from his shoulders. It was made of unwashed sheepskins, worn fleece side in, as the wildlings suggested. It kept the snow off well enough, and at night it was good and warm, but he kept his black cloak as well, folded up beneath his saddle. "Is it true you killed a giant once?" he asked Tormund as they rode. Ghost loped silently beside them, leaving paw prints in the new-fallen snow.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Now why would you doubt a mighty man like me? It was winter and I was half a boy, and stupid the way boys are. I went too far and my horse died and then a storm caught me. A true storm, not no little dusting such as this. Har! I knew I'd freeze to death before it broke. So I found me a sleeping giant, cut open her belly, and crawled up right inside her. Kept me warm enough, she did, but the stink near did for me. The worst thing was, she woke up when the spring come and took me for her babe. Suckled me for three whole moons before I could get away.

<div class="line_en">"Are all crows so curious?" asked Tormund. "Well, here's a tale for you. It were another winter, colder even than the one I spent inside that giant, and snowing day and night, snowflakes as big as your head, not these little things. It snowed so hard the whole village was half buried. I was in me Ruddy Hall, with only a cask o' mead to keep me company and nothing to do but drink it. The more I drank the more I got to thinking about this woman lived close by, a fine strong woman with the biggest pair of teats you ever saw. She had a temper on her, that one, but oh, she could be warm too, and in the deep of winter a man needs his warmth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“乌鸦都这么好奇吗？”托蒙德反问。“好吧，故事是这样的。那是另一个冬季，比我在巨人肚里渡过的那个还冷，没日没夜地下雪，雪花有你脑袋那么大，可不是现在这种小场面。大雪纷飞，整个村子被埋住一半，我住在红厅里面，陪伴我的只有一桶蜜酒。无事可做，只有喝酒，而我喝得越多，就越想住在附近的那个女人，她的模样强壮又漂亮，一对奶子更大得惊人，虽然脾气很坏，没错—但是，哦，她也很热和，在隆冬季节，男人就需要热和劲。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"The woman had a terrible temper, and she put up quite the fight when I laid hands on her. It was all I could do to carry her home and get her out o' them furs, but when I did, oh, she was hotter even than I remembered, and we had a fine old time, and then I went to sleep. Next morning when I woke the snow had stopped and the sun was shining, but I was in no fit state to enjoy it. All ripped and torn I was, and half me member bit right off, and there on me floor was a she-bear's pelt. And soon enough the free folk were telling tales o' this bald bear seen in the woods, with the queerest pair o' cubs behind her. Har! " He slapped a meaty thigh. "Would that I could find her again.

<div class="line_en">Too bloody plain, thought Jon, and it seems that half the column has seen it. He studied the falling snow so Tormund might not see him redden. I am a man of the Night's Watch, he reminded himself. So why did he feel like some blushing maid?</div>

<div class="line_en">He spent most of his days in Ygritte's company, and most nights as well. Mance Rayder had not been blind to Rattleshirt's mistrust of the "crow-come-over," so after he had given Jon his new sheepskin cloak he had suggested that he might want to ride with Tormund Giantsbane instead. Jon had happily agreed, and the very next day Ygritte and Longspear Ryk left Rattleshirt's band for Tormund's as well. "Free folk ride with who they want," the girl told him, "and we had a bellyful of Bag o' Bones."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他白天大部分时间都跟耶哥蕊特在一起，晚上也一样。由于叮当衫不信任“反复无常的乌鸦”，因此曼斯·雷德给了琼恩新羊皮斗篷之后，便提议让他跟随巨人克星托蒙德，琼恩愉快地接受了。第二天，耶哥蕊特和长矛里克便离开叮当衫的队伍，加入托蒙德的行列。“自由民想跟谁就跟谁，”女孩告诉他，“我们受够了那堆骨头。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Every night when they made camp, Ygritte threw her sleeping skins down beside his own, no matter if he was near the fire or well away from it. Once he woke to find her nestled against him, her arm across his chest. He lay listening to her breathe for a long time, trying to ignore the tension in his groin. Rangers often shared skins for warmth, but warmth was not all Ygritte wanted, he suspected. After that he had taken to using Ghost to keep her away. Old Nan used to tell stories about knights and their ladies who would sleep in a single bed with a blade between them for honor's sake, but he thought this must be the first time where a direwolf took the place of the sword.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="每晚扎营时，耶哥蕊特总是将毛皮铺在他身旁睡觉，也不管他离营火近还是远。有一回他半夜醒来，竟发觉她偎着自己，胳膊抱紧他的胸。他躺着倾听她的呼吸，许久许久，试图抑制股间的冲动。他安慰自己游骑兵经常大被同眠，却又怀疑取暖远非耶哥蕊特想要的全部。后来，他用白灵将两人隔开。在老奶妈的故事里，骑士当万不得已和女士同床时，为了荣誉，会在中间放一把剑，他想，用冰原狼来代替宝剑大概是世上头一遭吧。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At a lord's court the girl would never have been considered anything but common, he knew. She had a round peasant face, a pug nose, and slightly crooked teeth, and her eyes were too far apart. Jon had noticed all that the first time he'd seen her, when his dirk had been at her throat. Lately, though, he was noticing some other things. When she grinned, the crooked teeth didn't seem to matter. And maybe her eyes were too far apart, but they were a pretty blue-grey color, and lively as any eyes he knew. Sometimes she sang in a low husky voice that stirred him. And sometimes by the cookfire when she sat hugging her knees with the flames waking echoes in her red hair, and looked at him, just smiling… well, that stirred some things as well.</div>

<div class="line_en">Along with the Tormunds and the Longspears rode other sorts of wildlings, though; men like Rattleshirt and the Weeper who would as soon slit you as spit on you. There was Harma Dogshead, a squat keg of a woman with cheeks like slabs of white meat, who hated dogs and killed one every fortnight to make a fresh head for her banner; earless Styr, Magnar of Therm, whose own people thought him more god than lord; Varamyr Sixskins, a small mouse of a man whose steed was a savage white snow bear that stood thirteen feet tall on its hind legs. And wherever the bear and Varamyr went, three wolves and a shadowcat came following. Jon had been in his presence only once, and once had been enough; the mere sight of the man had made him bristle, even as the fur on the back of Ghost's neck had bristled at the sight of the bear and that long black-andwhite 'cat. And there were folks fiercer even than Varamyr, from the northernmost reaches of the haunted forest, the hidden valleys of the Frostfangs, and even queerer places: the men of the Frozen Shore who rode in chariots made of walrus bones pulled along by packs of savage dogs, the terrible ice-river clans who were said to feast on human flesh, the cave dwellers with their faces dyed blue and purple and green. With his own eyes Jon had beheld the Hornfoot men trotting along in column on bare soles as hard as boiled leather. He had not seen any snarks or grumpkins, but for all he knew Tormund would be having some to supper.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="跟托蒙德和长矛他们一起骑行的还有其他各种各样的野人：有的像叮当衫或哭泣者一样讨厌，不止朝他吐唾沫，还很乐意捅他一刀；狗头哈犸是个木桶般粗壮的女人，脸颊像两块厚厚的白肉，她最恨狗，每隔两周杀一条，并把新鲜狗头挂在旗上做标志；无耳的斯迪是瑟恩的马格拿，他的族人把他当神看待，而不仅仅是首领；“六形人”瓦拉米尔，老鼠一样的小个头，他的座骑是凶猛的白色雪熊，后腿直立起来足有十三尺高，他身边还跟了三匹狼和一只影子山猫。琼恩只见过他一次，一次就足以让他毛骨悚然，连白灵看到那头熊和黑白相间的大山猫时，也竖起了颈毛。还有比瓦拉米尔凶猛的野人，他们来自鬼影森林极北处，或霜雪之牙中的隐秘山谷，甚至更奇怪的地方。冰封海岸的原住民驾着海象骨战车，由彪悍的大白狗牵引；恐怖的冰川部落据说以人肉为生；穴居人把脸染成蓝、紫和绿色；矮小的硬足民赤脚列队在冰雪上疾走，脚板像沸水煮过的皮革。当然，队伍中没有什么古灵精怪，但他很确定如果必要，托蒙德也会弄一些来当夜宵。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I will kill him if I must. The prospect gave Jon no joy; there would be no honor in such a killing, and it would mean his own death as well. Yet he could not let the wildlings breach the Wall, to threaten Winterfell and the north, the barrowlands and the Rills, White Harbor and the Stony Shore, even the Neck. For eight thousand years the men of House Stark had lived and died to protect their people against such ravagers; and reavers… and bastard-born or no, the same blood ran in his veins. Bran and Rickon are still at Winterfell besides. Maester Luwin, Ser Rodrik, Old Nan, Farlen the kennelmaster, Mikken at his forge and Gage by his ovens… everyone I ever knew, everyone I ever loved.

<div class="line_en">The King-beyond-the-Wall was doing all he could, yet the wildlings remained hopelessly undisciplined, and that made them vulnerable. Here and there within the leagues-long snake that was their line of march were warriors as fierce as any in the Watch, but a good third of them were grouped at either end of the column, in Harma Dogshead's van and the savage rearguard with its giants, aurochs, and fire flingers. Another third rode with Mance himself near the center, guarding the wayns and sledges and dog carts that held the great bulk of the host's provisions and supplies, all that remained of the last summer harvest. The rest, divided into small bands under the likes of Rattleshirt, Jarl, Tormund Giantsbane, and the Weeper, served as outriders, foragers, and whips, galloping up and down the column endlessly to keep it moving in a more or less orderly fashion.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh, hundreds," she said furiously. "You know nothing, Jon Snow. You -- JON!"</div>

<div class="line_en">Jon turned at the sudden sound of wings. Blue-grey feathers filled his eyes, as sharp talons buried themselves in his face. Red pain lanced through him sudden and fierce as pinions beat round his head. He saw the beak, but there was no time to get a hand up or reach for a weapon. Jon reeled backward, his foot lost the stirrup, his garron broke in panic, and then he was falling. And still the eagle clung to his face, its talons tearing at him as it flapped and shrieked and pecked. The world turned upside down in a chaos of feathers and horseflesh and blood, and then the ground came up to smash him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="琼恩随着突如其来的拍翅声转头。灰蓝的巨翅遮蔽视线，尖利的爪子陷进他的脸。刺痛来得猛烈而突然，鹰翼围绕脑袋拍打。他看到鸟喙，但没时间抬手阻挡或取武器。于是他向后翻转，脚从马镫上脱出，马儿惊恐地跑开，人则向下坠落。那只鹰抓住他的脸不放，用爪子撕扯，尖叫着又拍又啄。世界在混乱中上下颠倒，羽毛、马肉和血液搅成一团，随着重重的撞击，地面迎将上来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The next he knew, he was on his face with the taste of mud and blood in his mouth and Ygritte kneeling over him protectively, a bone dagger in her hand. He could still hear wings, though the eagle was not in sight. Half his world was black. "My eye," he said in sudden panic, raising a hand to his face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他意识到的下一件事，是自己面孔朝下，嘴里满是泥土和鲜血的味道，耶哥蕊特保护性地跪在上方，手握兽骨匕首。他仍能听到翅膀的声音，那只鹰却看不见了。世界的一半都是黑暗。“我的眼睛，”他突然恐慌地喊，一边抬手摸向脸部。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The garron shied away from him when he approached, no doubt frightened by the blood on his face, but Jon calmed him with a few quiet words and finally got close enough to take the reins. As he swung back into the saddle his head whirled. I will need to get this tended, he thought, but not just now Let the King- beyond- the- Wall see what his eagle did to me. His right hand opened and closed, and he reached down for Longclaw and slung the bastard sword over a shoulder before he wheeled to trot back to where the Lord of Bones and his band were waiting.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他靠近时，坐骑惊恐地闪开，无疑被他满脸鲜血吓到了，琼恩的软语使它恢复平静，任他抓住缰绳，翻身上鞍。随着动作，他的脑袋阵阵晕眩。我需要包扎伤口，但现在不必，得先让塞外之王看看他的鹰对我做了什么。他先让右手开合片刻，然后握起长爪，甩到肩头，调转马匹，朝骸骨之王和他的队伍走去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Can a bird hate? Jon had slain the wildling Orell, but some part of the man remained within the eagle. The golden eyes looked out on him with cold malevolence. "I'll come," he said. The blood kept running down into his right eye, and his cheek was a blaze of pain. When he touched it his black gloves came away stained with red. "Let me catch my garron." It was not the horse he wanted so much as Ghost, but the direwolf was nowhere to be seen. He could be leagues away by now, ripping out the throat of some elk. Perhaps that was just as well.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="鸟也会记仇吗？琼恩杀死了野人欧瑞尔，但对方的一部分留在这只鹰体内，而今用金黄的眼瞳冷酷恶毒地看着他。“我就去，”他应道。血不停地流进右眼，脸颊火辣辣地痛。他触摸脸颊，黑手套成了红色，“请把马带来。”其实他想要的是白灵，不是马，但冰原狼不在身边，也许正在数里之外享用麋鹿呢。这个时候，他还是离开比较好。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a grim gallop. They rode two miles down the column through swirling snows, then cut through a tangle of baggage wayns to splash across the Milkwater where it took a great loop toward the east. A crust of thin ice covered the river shallows; with every step their horses'hooves crashed through, until they reached the deeper water ten yards out. The snow seemed be falling even faster on the eastern bank, and the drifts were deeper too. Even the wind is colder. And night was falling too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一路快跑，气氛阴郁。他们沿着队伍，在翻滚的雪花中骑行两里地，然后穿越一堆乱七八糟的辎重车，溅起水花跨过乳河。在这里，乳河向东绕个大弯，形成浅滩，上面覆着薄冰，任由马蹄清脆踩踏，走出十码开外，方才变深。东岸的雪下得更疾，积雪更深，风也更冷。夜晚快要降临了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But even through the blowing snow, the shape of the great white hill that loomed above the trees was unmistakable. The Fist of the First Men. Jon heard the scream of the eagle overhead. A raven looked down from a soldier pine and quorked as he went past. Had the Old Bear made his attack? Instead of the clash of steel and the thrum of arrows taking flight, Jon heard only the soft crunch of frozen crust beneath his garron's hooves.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但透过风雪，他能看见耸立在森林上方的巨大白色山丘。先民拳峰。头顶传来老鹰的尖叫，经过士卒松时，一只乌鸦从上俯瞰，发出刺耳的声音。莫非熊老开始行动了？可听不到金铁相交和弓箭弹射，惟有马蹄踩破碎冰的轻微吱嘎。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In silence they circled round to the south slope, where the approach was easiest. It was there at the bottom that Jon saw the dead horse, sprawled at the base of the hill, half buried in the snow. Entrails spilled from the belly of the animal like frozen snakes, and one of its legs was gone. Wolves, was Jon's first thought, but that was wrong. Wolves eat their kill.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们沉默地绕到南坡，那是上山的便利途径。琼恩在山丘底部看到死马，半埋在积雪里，肠子从腹部流出，活象冻僵的蛇，一条腿也不见了。是狼干的，琼恩先这么想，随即发现不对，狼会把猎物吃掉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">More garrons were strewn across the slope, legs twisted grotesquely, blind eyes staring in death. The wildlings crawled over them like flies, stripping them of saddles, bridles, packs, and armor, and hacking them apart with stone axes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="更多马尸散布在山坡，腿脚奇异地扭曲，无神的眼睛空洞地睁开。野人们象苍蝇一样附在它们身上，剥下鞍子、缰绳、包裹和甲胄等，用石斧将它们切开。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Outside the ringwall they dismounted to squeeze through a crooked gap in the stones. The carcass of a shaggy brown garron was impaled upon the sharpened stakes the Old Bear had placed inside every entrance. He was trying to get out, not in. There was no sign of a rider.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们在环墙外下马，挤过石头间歪扭的通道。一匹毛发蓬松的棕色战马戳在一根削尖木桩上，熊老在每个入口内都放置了这样的木桩。这马是想冲出去，不是闯进来。没有骑手的踪迹。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Inside was more, and worse. Jon had never seen pink snow before. The wind gusted around him, pulling at his heavy sheepskin cloak. Ravens flapped from one dead horse to the next. Are those wild ravens, or our own? Jon could not tell. He wondered where poor Sam was now. And what he was.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="里边有更多马尸和更糟糕的情形在等着他——琼恩从没见过粉红色的雪。朔风在周围涌动，拉扯厚重的羊皮白斗篷，乌鸦拍着翅膀在死马间飞来飞去。这是野生乌鸦还是我们的信鸦？琼恩无法判断。他不知可怜的山姆现在在哪儿，成了什么东西。">查看中文翻译</div>
