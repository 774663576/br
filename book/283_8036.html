<div class="line_en">Their road to this detached cottage was down Vicarage Lane, a lane leading at right angles from the broad, though irregular, main street of the place; and, as may be inferred, containing the blessed abode of Mr. Elton. A few inferior dwellings were first to be passed, and then, about a quarter of a mile down the lane rose the Vicarage, an old and not very good house, almost as close to the road as it could be. It had no advantage of situation; but had been very much smartened up by the present proprietor; and, such as it was, there could be no possibility of the two friends passing it without a slackened pace and observing eyes. -- Emma's remark was -- `There it is. There go you and your riddle-book one of these days.' -- Harriet's was -- `Oh, what a sweet house! -- How very beautiful! -- There are the yellow curtains that Miss Nash admires so much.'</div>

Fortune I do not want; employment I do not want; consequence I do not want: I believe few married women are half as much mistress of their husband's house as I am of Hartfield; and never, never could I expect to be so truly beloved and important; so always first and always right in any man's eyes as I am in my father's.'</div>

<div class="line_en">`Never mind, Harriet, I shall not be a poor old maid; and it is poverty only which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous public! A single woman, with a very narrow income, must be a ridiculous, disagreeable old maid! the proper sport of boys and girls, but a single woman, of good fortune, is always respectable, and may be as sensible and pleasant as any body else. And the distinction is not quite so much against the candour and common sense of the world as appears at first; for a very narrow income has a tendency to contract the mind, and sour the temper. Those who can barely live, and who live perforce in a very small, and generally very inferior, society, may well be illiberal and cross. This does not apply, however, to Miss Bates; she is only too good natured and too silly to suit me; but, in general, she is very much to the taste of every body, though single and though poor. Poverty certainly has not contracted her mind: I really believe, if she had only a shilling in the world, she would be very likely to give away sixpence of it; and nobody is afraid of her: that is a great charm.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不要担心，哈丽特，我不会变成个穷老婆子。对于宽宏大量的公众来说，只有贫穷才能使独身者让人瞧不起！一个收入微薄的单身女人，肯定要变成一个荒唐可笑、令人讨厌的老姑娘，成为青年男女嘲弄的对象！可是一个有钱的单身女人，却总是十分体面，既聪明又讨人喜欢，比谁都不逊色。这话初听起来似乎有失公正，有悖常理，其实并非如此，因为收入微薄往往使人变得心胸狭窄，性情乖僻。那些只能勉强糊口、不得不生活在一个通常十分卑微的狭小圈子的人，很可能又狭隘又暴躁。不过，贝茨小姐并不属于这种情况。她脾气太好，脑瓜太笨，因而才不讨我喜欢。不过，总的说来，尽管她没有嫁人，又没有钱，她倒挺讨众人喜欢。当然，贫穷并没有使她变得心胸狭窄。我确信，她若是只有一个先令的家当，那她很可能把其中六便士分给别人。谁也不害怕她，这是她讨人喜欢的一个重要原因。”">查看中文翻译</div>

Woman's usual occupations of hand and mind will be as open to me then as they are now; or with no important variation. If I draw less, I shall read more; if I give up music, I shall take to carpet-work. And as for objects of interest, objects for the affections, which is in truth the great point of inferiority, the want of which is really the great evil to be avoided in not marrying, I shall be very well off, with all the children of a sister I love so much, to care about. There will be enough of them, in all probability, to supply every sort of sensation that declining life can need. There will be enough for every hope and every fear; and though my attachment to none can equal that of a parent, it suits my ideas of comfort better than what is warmer and blinder.

Every letter from her is read forty times over; her compliments to all friends go round and round again; and if she does but send her aunt the pattern of a stomacher, or knit a pair of garters for her grandmother, one hears of nothing else for a month.

<div class="line_en">They were now approaching the cottage, and all idle topics were superseded. Emma was very compassionate; and the distresses of the poor were as sure of relief from her personal attention and kindness, her counsel and her patience, as from her purse. She understood their ways, could allow for their ignorance and their temptations, had no romantic expectations of extraordinary virtue from those for whom education had done so little; entered into their troubles with ready sympathy, and always gave her assistance with as much intelligence as good-will. In the present instance, it was sickness and poverty together which she came to visit; and after remaining there as long as she could give comfort or advice, she quitted the cottage with such an impression of the scene as made her say to Harriet, as they walked away, `These are the sights, Harriet, to do one good. How trifling they make every thing else appear! -- I feel now as if I could think of nothing but these poor creatures all the rest of the day; and yet, who can say how soon it may all vanish from my mind?'</div>

Well, (smiling,) I hope it may be allowed that if compassion has produced exertion and relief to the sufferers, it has done all that is truly important.

<div class="line_en">Anxious to separate herself from them as far as she could, she soon afterwards took possession of a narrow footpath, a little raised on one side of the lane, leaving them together in the main road. But she had not been there two minutes when she found that Harriet's habits of dependence and imitation were bringing her up too, and that, in short, they would both be soon after her. This would not do; she immediately stopped, under pretence of having some alteration to make in the lacing of her half-boot, and stooping down in complete occupation of the footpath, begged them to have the goodness to walk on, and she would follow in half a minute. They did as they were desired; and by the time she judged it reasonable to have done with her boot, she had the comfort of farther delay in her power, being overtaken by a child from the cottage, setting out, according to orders, with her pitcher, to fetch broth from Hartfield. To walk by the side of this child, and talk to and question her, was the most natural thing in the world, or would have been the most natural, had she been acting just then without design; and by this means the others were still able to keep ahead, without any obligation of waiting for her. She gained on them, however, involuntarily: the child's pace was quick, and theirs rather slow; and she was the more concerned at it, from their being evidently in a conversation which interested them. Mr. Elton was speaking with animation, Harriet listening with a very pleased attention; and Emma, having sent the child on, was beginning to think how she might draw back a little more, when they both looked around, and she was obliged to join them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她急于想离他们远些，便迅即走上巷子一边微微凸起的狭窄的人行道，让他们俩走在大路上。但是，她在人行道上还没走上两分钟，便发现哈丽特早已养成小鸟依人、紧随不舍的习惯，转眼间就跟了上来，还有那另一个人，势必也会马上跟踵而至。这可不行。她立刻收住脚步，假装要重新系一系鞋带，便弯下腰挡住人行道，叫他们往前走，她随后赶上去。他们照她的意思办了。等她觉得鞋带该系好了，她又欣然找到了进一步拖延的机会，因为小屋里有个女孩遵照她的吩咐，提着壶去哈特菲尔德取肉汤，这时赶上了她。跟这小孩并排走着，跟她说说话，问些问题，这是再自然不过的事情，即使她当时并不存心拖延时间，那也是再自然不过的事情。这样一来，那另外两人还得在前面走着，完全用不着等她。然而，她情不由己地离他们越来越近。原来，那小女孩脚步迈得快，他们两个却走得慢，而使爱玛越发着急的是，那两个人显然谈得正投机。埃尔顿先生兴致勃勃地谈着，哈丽特喜行于色地听着。爱玛叫那女孩先走，刚想琢磨如何落得远些，不料那两人突然掉过头来，她只得走上前去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mr. Elton looked all happiness at this proposition; and nothing could exceed his alertness and attention in conducting them into his house and endeavouring to make every thing appear to advantage. The room they were taken into was the one he chiefly occupied, and looking forwards; behind it was another with which it immediately communicated; the door between them was open, and Emma passed into it with the housekeeper to receive her assistance in the most comfortable manner. She was obliged to leave the door ajar as she found it; but she fully intended that Mr. Elton should close it. It was not closed, however, it still remained ajar; but by engaging the housekeeper in incessant conversation, she hoped to make it practicable for him to chuse his own subject in the adjoining room. For ten minutes she could hear nothing but herself. It could be protracted no longer. She was then obliged to be finished, and make her appearance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃尔顿先生一听这话，不由得喜笑颜开。他小心翼翼、毕恭毕敬地把两位小姐领进房，尽量把处处搞得妥妥帖帖。他把她们带进他常住的那间屋子。这屋子朝着大门，后面还有一间屋子，跟它直接相连。那门开着，爱玛跟女管家走进后屋，欣欣然地接受她的帮助。她只得让门照旧开着，不过她满心以为埃尔顿先生会把它关上。可是门并未关上，还依然开着。但她与女管家不停地交谈，实指望埃尔顿先生可以在隔壁房间随意说话。足有十分钟工夫，她什么声音也听不到，只听见她自己在说话。这种局面再也持续不下去了。她只得赶紧办完事，走进了前屋。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">`Part of my lace is gone,' said she, `and I do not know how I am to contrive. I really am a most troublesome companion to you both, but I hope I am not often so ill-equipped. Mr. Elton, I must beg leave to stop at your house, and ask your housekeeper for a bit of ribband or string, or any thing just to keep my boot on.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我的鞋带断了，”她说，“不知道该怎么办。我真成了你们的累赘了，不过我想我并非常出这种事。埃尔顿先生，我只得要求在贵府歇一歇，向你的女管家要一节丝带或细绳之类的东西，把靴子系好。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The lovers were standing together at one of the windows. It had a most favourable aspect; and, for half a minute, Emma felt the glory of having schemed successfully. But it would not do; he had not come to the point. He had been most agreeable, most delightful; he had told Harriet that he had seen them go by, and had purposely followed them; other little gallantries and allusions had been dropt, but nothing serious.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两个情人一道站在一个窗户前。这是个极好的迹象，一时间，爱玛自鸣得意地觉得她的计谋得逞了。但是，还不能沾沾自喜，埃尔顿先生还没有谈到要害问题。他非常和蔼，非常可爱，告诉哈丽特说，他看见她们俩走过去了，便有意跟在后面。他还说了些别的讨好的话，但却没有认真的表示。">查看中文翻译</div>
