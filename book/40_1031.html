<div class="line_en">I"We're in Deh-Mazang," he said. They were outside, on the sidewalk. He had her suitcase in one hand and was unlocking the wooden front gate with the other. "In the south and west part of the city. The zoo is nearby, and the university too."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们在德马赞区。”他说。他们在外面，在人行道上。他一只手拉着她的行李箱，另外一只手去开屋前木门的锁头。“在城市的西南边。动物园就在附近，大学也是。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mariam nodded. Already she had learned that, though she could understand him, she had to pay close attention when he spoke. She was unaccustomed to the Kabuli dialect of his Farsi, and to the underlying layer of Pashto accent, the language of his native Kandahar. He, on the other hand, seemed to have no trouble understanding her Herati Farsi.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mariam quickly surveyed the narrow, unpaved road along which Rasheed's house was situated. The houses on this road were crowded together and shared common walls, with small, walled yards in front buffering them from the street. Most of the homes had flat roofs and were made of burned brick, some of mud the same dusty color as the mountains that ringed the city.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛丽雅姆匆匆看了一眼拉希德房子所在的狭窄泥土路。两边的房子挨得很紧，每户人家的墙壁都是共用的，房子前方和马路之间隔着小小的、带围墙的院落。多数房子有着平坦的屋顶，由烧砖砌成；也有由土砖砌成的，灰不溜秋的颜色和环绕城市四周的山脉一样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When Rasheed opened the front gate, Mariam found herself in a small, unkempt yard where yellow grass struggled up in thin patches. Mariam saw an outhouse on the right, in a side yard, and, on the left, a well with a hand pump, a row of dying saplings. Near the well was a tool-shed, and a bicycle leaning against the wall.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="拉希德打开前门，玛丽雅姆走了进去，发现院子很小，而且蓬乱，几堆枯黄的杂草东歪西倒。玛丽雅姆看到房子右边有个厕所，左边有个手摇井和一排枯萎的树苗。井边是一间摆放工具的小房子，墙上靠着一辆自行车。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Gutters separated the sidewalk from the road on both sides and flowed with muddy water. Mariam saw small mounds of flyblown garbage littering the street here and there. Rasheed's house had two stories. Mariam could see that it had once been blue.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="街道两旁都有排水沟把车道和人行道隔开，排水沟中流淌着肮脏的污水。玛丽雅姆看见马路上到处散落着一堆堆苍蝇飞舞的垃圾。拉希德的房子有两层。玛丽雅姆看得出它原先是蓝色的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Your father told me you like to fish," Rasheed said as they were crossing the yard to the house. There was no backyard, Mariam saw. "There are valleys north of here. Rivers with lots of fish. Maybe I'll take you someday."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你父亲跟我说过你喜欢钓鱼。”他们穿过院子向房子走去时，拉希德说。玛丽雅姆发现没有后院。“这里的北边有一些山谷。河里有很多鱼。找一天我带你去吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was a hallway, a living room downstairs, and a kitchen in which he showed her pots and pans and a pressure cooker and a kerosene ishtop. The living room had a pistachio green leather couch. It had a rip down its side that had been clumsily sewn together. The walls were bare. There was a table, two cane-seat chairs, two folding chairs, and, in the corner, a black, cast-iron stove.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mariam stood in the middle of the living room, looking around. At the kolba, she could touch the ceiling with her fingertips. She could lie in her cot and tell the time of day by the angle of sunlight pouring through the window. She knew how far her door would open before its hinges creaked. She knew every splinter and crack in each of the thirty wooden floorboards. Now all those familiar things were gone. Nana was dead, and she was here, in a strange city, separated from the life she'd known by valleys and chains of snow-capped mountains and entire deserts. She was in a stranger's house, with all its different rooms and its smell of cigarette smoke, with its unfamiliar cupboards full of unfamiliar utensils, its heavy, dark green curtains, and a ceiling she knew she could not reach. The space of it suffocated Mariam. Pangs of longing bore into her, for Nana, for Mullah Faizullah, for her old life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛丽雅姆站在客厅中央，环顾四周。在泥屋，她伸手就能碰到屋顶。她可以躺在草席上，根据阳光从窗口照射进来的角度来判断一天到了什么时候。她知道房门推得多开它的铰链就会吱嘎、吱嘎响。她知道三十块木地板上的每一道裂痕和缝隙。现在所有这些熟悉的东西都不见了。娜娜死了，而她在这儿，在初来乍到的城市中，她所熟知的生活已然被峡谷、山顶白雪皑皑的群峰和不见人烟的荒漠阻断。她在一个素昧平生的人家中，所有的房间和原来的都不相同，弥漫着烟味，悬挂着厚重的深绿色窗帘，陌生的橱柜中摆满了陌生的器皿，还有一片她知道自己无法触及的天花板。它的空旷让玛丽雅姆感到窒息。她心中一阵阵地发痛，为娜娜，为法苏拉赫毛拉，也为她以往的生活。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then she was crying.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后，她哭了起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What's this crying about?" Rasheed said crossly. He reached into the pocket of his pants, uncurled Mariam's fingers, and pushed a handkerchief into her palm. He lit himself a cigarette and leaned against the wall. He watched as Mariam pressed the handkerchief to her eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你哭什么呢？”拉希德粗声地问。他把手伸进裤兜，然后掰开玛丽雅姆的手指头，把一条手帕塞进她手里。他自己点了一根烟，依靠在墙壁上。他看着玛丽雅姆用手帕去擦眼泪。">查看中文翻译</div>

Behind us, east, you can't see from here, is the Shir Darwaza mountain. Every day, at noon, they shoot a cannon from it. Stop your crying, now. I mean it."</div>

<div class="line_en">There was a narrow, dimly lit hallway there and two bedrooms. The door to the bigger one was ajar. Through it Mariam could see that it, like the rest of the house, was sparsely furnished: bed in the corner, with a brown blanket and a pillow, a closet, a dresser. The walls were bare except for a small mirror. Rasheed closed the door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="楼上有一条灯光昏暗的狭窄走廊和两间卧室。面积比较大那间卧室的房门虚掩着。透过那扇门，玛丽雅姆能见到里面的情况：和这座房子别的地方一样，房间里的摆设很简单，墙角有一张床，床上有一条棕色的毛毯和一个枕头，此外还有一只衣柜，一个梳妆台。墙壁上除了一面镜子，什么都没挂。拉希德把门关上。">查看中文翻译</div>
