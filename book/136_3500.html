<div class="line_en">As he fastened the belt of his overalls he strolled across to the window. The sun must have gone down behind the houses; it was not shining into the yard any longer. The flagstones were wet as though they had just been washed, and he had the feeling that the sky had been washed too, so fresh and pale was the blue between the chimney-pots. Tirelessly the woman marched to and fro, corking and uncorking herself, singing and falling silent, and pegging out more diapers, and more and yet more. He wondered whether she took in washing for a living or was merely the slave of twenty or thirty grandchildren. Julia had come across to his side; together they gazed down with a sort of fascination at the sturdy figure below. As he looked at the woman in her characteristic attitude, her thick arms reaching up for the line, her powerful mare-like buttocks protruded, it struck him for the first time that she was beautiful. It had never before occurred to him that the body of a woman of fifty, blown up to monstrous dimensions by childbearing, then hardened, roughened by work till it was coarse in the grain like an over-ripe turnip, could be beautiful. But it was so, and after all, he thought, why not? The solid, contourless body, like a block of granite, and the rasping red skin, bore the same relation to the body of a girl as the rose-hip to the rose. Why should the fruit be held inferior to the flower?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他一边系着工作服的皮带，一边慢慢走到窗口。太阳肯定落到房子后面去了，院子里已经没有阳光。地上的石板潮湿，好像刚刚洗过，他觉得天空也刚洗过，烟窗间的蓝天如此清新和轻淡。那个女人不知疲倦地走来走去，时而唱歌，时而沉默，没完没了地夹着尿布。他想知道她是否以洗衣为生，或者只是二三十个孙子孙女的奴隶。朱丽亚来到他身边，他们一起欣赏地注视着楼下这个强壮的女人。他看着她很有特点的姿态，她丰腴的手臂伸到绳子上，她有力的马一般的臀部翘起，他第一次觉得她很美。之前他从未想到一个五十岁女人的身体，因艰辛的养儿育女而发胖，接着又因劳作而僵硬、粗糙，直至皱巴巴的成了像谷仓里的一只老萝卜，会是美的。但毕竟这个女人是美的，他想，为什么就不能美呢？这个结实、没有曲线可言的身体，像一块花岗岩，而显得粗糙的通红的皮肤也可让人想到少女的身体，就如由玫瑰果可以想到玫瑰花一样。为什么果实就要比花朵逊色呢？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He held Julia's supple waist easily encircled by his arm. From the hip to the knee her flank was against his. Out of their bodies no child would ever come. That was the one thing they could never do. Only by word of mouth, from mind to mind, could they pass on the secret. The woman down there had no mind, she had only strong arms, a warm heart, and a fertile belly. He wondered how many children she had given birth to. It might easily be fifteen. She had had her momentary flowering, a year, perhaps, of wild-rose beauty and then she had suddenly swollen like a fertilized fruit and grown hard and red and coarse, and then her life had been laundering, scrubbing, darning, cooking, sweeping, polishing, mending, scrubbing, laundering, first for children, then for grandchildren, over thirty unbroken years. At the end of it she was still singing. The mystical reverence that he felt for her was somehow mixed up with the aspect of the pale, cloudless sky, stretching away behind the chimney-pots into interminable distance. It was curious to think that the sky was the same for everybody, in Eurasia or Eastasia as well as here. And the people under the sky were also very much the same -- everywhere, all over the world, hundreds of thousands of millions of people just like this, people ignorant of one another's existence, held apart by walls of hatred and lies, and yet almost exactly the same -- people who had never learned to think but who were storing up in their hearts and bellies and muscles the power that would one day overturn the world. If there was hope, it lay in the proles! Without having read to the end of THE BOOK, he knew that that must be Goldstein's final message. The future belonged to the proles. And could he be sure that when their time came the world they constructed would not be just as alien to him, Winston Smith, as the world of the Party? Yes, because at the least it would be a world of sanity. Where there is equality there can be sanity. Sooner or later it would happen, strength would change into consciousness. The proles were immortal, you could not doubt it when you looked at that valiant figure in the yard. In the end their awakening would come. And until that happened, though it might be a thousand years, they would stay alive against all the odds, like birds, passing on from body to body the vitality which the Party did not share and could not kill.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他伸手搂着朱丽亚柔软的腰肢。从臀部到膝盖，她的一侧身体紧贴着他。他们的身体将不会生儿育女。这是他们永远不能做的一件事，只能通过口头方式，从心灵到心灵，他们才能把秘密传下去。楼下的女人没有头脑，她只有强壮的手臂、热心肠和肥沃的肚子。他想她一共生了多少孩子呢。很可能有十五个。她有过片刻的花季，也许一年，像野玫瑰一样美丽，随后身体突然膨胀起来，像一只成熟的水果，再发硬、发红、变粗，接着，她的生活就是没完没了的洗涤、擦抹、织补、烧煮、打扫、擦亮、修补、擦抹、洗涤，先是为儿女，再是为孙子孙女，三十多年从不间断。到了最后，她还在唱歌。他对她产生的神秘的联想多少有点与轻淡、晴朗，从烟窗顶上延伸到远方的天空混杂在一起。奇怪的是，他想到，这天空对每个人而言，是同一个天空，无论欧亚国还是东亚国，都和这儿一样。天空下的人民也大同小异——全世界各地，众多的人民也是如此，对彼此的存在一无所知，被仇恨和谎言的高墙隔绝，然而，几乎完全是一样的人——他们从未学习去思考，但他们在内心、肚腹和肌肉中积聚力量，有朝一日会改天换地。如果有希望，希望在无产者身上！虽然还没有读完那本书，但他知道那必定是戈尔施泰因的最后信息。未来属于无产者。他不能确定，当他们的时代到来，他们建设的世界对他，史密斯·温斯顿来说，不会像党的世界一样格格不入吧？不会，因为至少这会是一个健全的世界。有平等的社会就是健全的社会。这迟早会发生，他们会意识到自己的力量。无产者是不朽的，当你看一下院子里那个坚定的女人，你就不会怀疑这一点。他们的觉醒终有一天会来到。可能要等一千年。但不论多么困难，他们仍会活着，就像飞鸟，将党所不能拥有，亦不能扼杀的生活活力代代相传。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They were not touching, but it seemed to him that he could feel Julia's body shaking. Or perhaps it was merely the shaking of his own. He could just stop his teeth from chattering, but his knees were beyond his control. There was a sound of trampling boots below, inside the house and outside. The yard seemed to be full of men. Something was being dragged across the stones. The woman's singing had stopped abruptly. There was a long, rolling clang, as though the washtub had been flung across the yard, and then a confusion of angry shouts which ended in a yell of pain.</div>

The room was full of solid men in black uniforms, with iron-shod boots on their feet and truncheons in their hands.</div>

<div class="line_en">Winston was not trembling any longer. Even his eyes he barely moved. One thing alone mattered; to keep still, to keep still and not give them an excuse to hit you! A man with a smooth prize-fighter's jowl in which the mouth was only a slit paused opposite him balancing his truncheon meditatively between thumb and forefinger. Winston met his eyes. The feeling of nakedness, with one's hands behind one's head and one's face and body all exposed, was almost unbearable. The man protruded the tip of a white tongue, licked the place where his lips should have been, and then passed on. There was another crash. Someone had picked up the glass paperweight from the table and smashed it to pieces on the hearth-stone.</div>

<div class="line_en">The fragment of coral, a tiny crinkle of pink like a sugar rosebud from a cake, rolled across the mat. How small, thought Winston, how small it always was! There was a gasp and a thump behind him, and he received a violent kick on the ankle which nearly flung him off his balance. One of the men had smashed his fist into Julia's solar plexus, doubling her up like a pocket ruler. She was thrashing about on the floor, fighting for breath. Winston dared not turn his head even by a millimetre, but sometimes her livid, gasping face came within the angle of his vision. Even in his terror it was as though he could feel the pain in his own body, the deadly pain which nevertheless was less urgent than the struggle to get back her breath. He knew what it was like; the terrible, agonizing pain which was there all the while but could not be suffered yet, because before all else it was necessary to be able to breathe. Then two of the men hoisted her up by knees and shoulders, and carried her out of the room like a sack. Winston had a glimpse of her face, upside down, yellow and contorted, with the eyes shut, and still with a smear of rouge on either cheek; and that was the last he saw of her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="珊瑚的碎片，粉红色的一小粒，就像蛋糕上的一颗糖做的玫瑰花蕾，滚落在地毯上。好小啊，温斯顿想，它总是这么小！他身后有吸气和重击的声音，他的膝盖被狠狠地踢了一脚，差点跌倒在地。有人一拳打在朱丽亚的胸口，她像折尺一样弯下了腰。她痛得在地板上打滚，喘不过气来。温斯顿根本不敢回头，但有时她乌青色、喘息的脸会进入他的视线。即使他很害怕，但他好像感到痛在他自己身上，然而，要命的疼痛还在其次，更要紧的是能够再次呼吸。他知道这是怎么回事，可怕的剧痛一直在那儿，但还一时顾不上，因为首要的事情是能够呼吸。这时，有两个人过来拽住她的腿和肩膀，像拎麻袋一样把她拎出了房间。温斯顿看了一眼她颠倒的脸，脸色蜡黄，面孔扭曲，眼睛闭着，两边面颊上涂的胭脂还在。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He stood dead still. No one had hit him yet. Thoughts which came of their own accord but seemed totally uninteresting began to flit through his mind. He wondered whether they had got Mr Charrington. He wondered what they had done to the woman in the yard. He noticed that he badly wanted to urinate, and felt a faint surprise, because he had done so only two or three hours ago. He noticed that the clock on the mantelpiece said nine, meaning twenty-one. But the light seemed too strong. Would not the light be fading at twenty-one hours on an August evening? He wondered whether after all he and Julia had mistaken the time -- had slept the clock round and thought it was twenty-thirty when really it was nought eight-thirty on the following morning. But he did not pursue the thought further. It was not interesting.</div>
