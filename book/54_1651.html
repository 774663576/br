<div class="line_en">I looked down at my grandmother from midway up one of the wooden poles Papa had set out to mark the length of the cotton field. Big Ma was Papa's mother, and like him she was tall and strongly built. Her clear, smooth skin was the color of a pecan shell. "Ah, Big Ma, I ain't gonna fall." I scoffed, then climbed onto the next strong spike and reached for a fibrous puff at the top of a tall cotton stalk.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我站在架子上，回头看了一眼奶奶。奶奶跟爸爸一样，又高又壮，健康光滑的皮肤透着山核桃色的光泽。“啊，奶奶，我不会掉下去的。”我爬到另一根竿子上，把高高地长在棉花茎上的棉花摘了下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You she' better not fall, girl," grumbled Big Ma. "Sometimes I wish we had more low cotton like down 'round Vicksburg. I don't like y'all children climbin' them things." She looked around, her hand on her hip. Christopher-John and Little Man farther down the field balanced skillfully on lower spikes of their own poles plucking the last of the cot- ton, but Stacey, too heavy now to climb the poles, was forced to remain on the ground. Big Ma eyed us all again, then with a burlap bag slung across her right shoulder and dangling at the left side of her waist she moved down the row toward Mama. "Mary, child. I think with what we picked today we oughta have ourselves another bale."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你最好别掉下来，孩子。”奶奶嘟哝道，“有时候我倒希望这些棉花长得矮一些，像维京伯格家的一样。我可不乐意老看着孩子们在上面爬。”她背着手，环顾着四周。克里斯托弗和小家伙在远处，以极好的平衡感，采摘着较矮的棉花。而斯泰西呢，因为太重了，只能留在地面。奶奶又看了我们一眼，才背起装满棉花的粗布袋，摇摇晃晃地走向妈妈：“玛丽，我想我们今天摘的要另外装一袋了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mama was stooped over a low cotton branch. She stuffed one last puff into her bag and straightened. She was tawny- colored, thin and sinewy, with delicate features in a strong- jawed face, and though almost as tall as Big Ma, she seemed somewhat dwarfed beside her. "I expect you're right, Mama," she said. "Come Monday, we'd better haul it up to the Granger place and have it ginned. Then we can -- Cassie, what's the matter!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="妈妈站在一株低垂下来的棉花枝前，把最后一朵棉花摘下塞进粗布袋里，直起身。妈妈有些瘦，不过肌肉发达，黄褐色的皮肤透着光泽，脸庞柔美。她虽然和奶奶一样高，但站在一起时，她还是显得瘦小。“我也觉得，妈妈。”她回答道，“我们最好在周一前把棉花送到格兰杰那轧棉，然后我们就能——凯西，你怎么了？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I didn't answer Mama. I had moved to the very top of my pole and could now see above the field to the road where two figures, one much taller than the other, were walking briskly. As the men rounded a curve in the road, they became more distinct. There was in the easy fluid gait of the shorter man a familiarity that made me gasp. I squinted, shadowing my eyes from the sun, then slipped like lightning down the pole.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我没说话。我正往竿子顶端爬，远眺棉花田。棉花田外的道路上，出现了两个身影，其中一个特别高，步履轻快。他们拐弯后，我看得更清楚了。那个较矮的身影，走起来的样子异常熟悉。我眯着眼，抵挡着太阳的强光，心“咚咚”地跳得厉害，我像一道闪电般跳下竿子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="把小家伙放回地上，爸爸回答道：“回来看你们呀。”他拥抱并亲吻了我们，然后直起身，“看看你们，渐渐长大了，小不点要变大孩子啦。”他回过身说，“莫里森先生，这是我的孩子们，不错吧？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In our excitement, we had taken no notice of the other man standing quietly at the side of the road. But now, gazing upward at the most formidable-looking being we had ever encountered, we huddled closer to Papa.</div>

<div class="line_en">The man was a human tree in height, towering high above Papa's six feet two inches. The long trunk of his massive body bulged with muscles, and his skin, of the deepest ebony, was partially scarred upon his face and neck, as if by fire. Deep lifelines were cut into his face and his hair was splotched with gray, but his eyes were clear and penetrating. I glanced at the boys and it was obvious to me that they were wondering the same thing as I: Where had such a being come from!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那男人高得像一棵大树一样，高过了一米八几的爸爸。他身上肌肉发达，皮肤黝黑，脸上和脖子上有像是被火烧过的伤痕。他头发灰白夹杂，脸上布满岁月的痕迹，但他的眼睛干净而清澈。我瞥了一眼男孩子们，他们此刻心里大概和我想的一样，都有这样一个疑问：“他到底是从哪里来的？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Don't y'all go through that fence!" Big Ma called after us. But we pretended not to hear. We held the second and third rows of the prickly wire wide for each other to climb through: then all four of us sped down the road toward Papa.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Children," said Papa, "meet Mr. L. T. Morrison." Each of us whispered a faint hello to the giant, then the six of us started up the road toward home. Before we reached the house, Mama and Big Ma met us. When Papa saw Mama, his square, high-cheekboned face opened to a wide smile and, lifting Mama with spirited gusto, he swung her around twice before setting her down and kissing her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“孩子们，这是莫里森先生。”我们小声地跟莫里森先生打了招呼后，便往家的方向走去。还没走到家，奶奶和妈妈就在半路和我们会合了。当爸爸见到妈妈第一眼时，笑得嘴都合不拢了，他把妈妈抱了起来，旋转了两圈，并亲吻了妈妈。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When we reached the house we climbed the long, sloping lawn to the porch and went into Mama and Papa's room, which also served as the living area. Mama offered Mr. Morrison Grandpa Logan's chair, a cushioned oak rocker skillfully crafted by Grandpa himself; but Mr. Morrison did not sit down immediately. Instead, he stood gazing at the room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们一回家，就一块儿挤进了爸爸妈妈的起居室里，有时这儿也被当作客厅。妈妈拿了一把爷爷亲手做的橡木摇椅给莫里森先生坐，但他并没有坐下，只是站着，环顾着整个房间。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a warm, comfortable room of doors and wood and pictures. From it a person could reach the front or the side porch, the kitchen, and the two other bedrooms. Its walls were made of smooth oak, and on them hung gigantic photographs of Grandpa and Big Ma. Papa and Uncle Hammer when they were boys, Papa's two eldest brothers, who were now dead, and pictures of Mama's family. The furniture, a mixture of Logan-crafted walnut and oak, included a walnut bed whose ornate headboard rose halfway up the wall toward the high ceiling, a grand chiffonier with a floor- length mirror, a large rolltop desk which had once been Grandpa's but now belonged to Mama, and the four oak chairs, two of them rockers, which Grandpa had made for Big Ma as a wedding present.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="房间舒适而温暖，摆放着一些木柜和照片。房间可以通到前后门廊、厨房和其他两间卧室。墙壁是光滑的橡木，上面挂着几张大照片，有爷爷奶奶年轻时的照片、爸爸和哈默大伯的合照、爸爸的最大的两个哥哥（现在已经不在人世了）的照片，还有妈妈一家人的照片。家里的家具，都是爷爷用胡桃木和橡木做的，包括一张床头装饰华丽的胡桃木床、一个镶着落地镜的大衣柜、一张可活动的桌子。这张桌子原来是奶奶用的，现在属于妈妈了。还有四把椅子，其中有两把摇椅，是当初爷爷送给奶奶的结婚礼物。">查看中文翻译</div>
