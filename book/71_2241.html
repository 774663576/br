<div class="line_en">Stretched out on the bed, weakly outlined by a dusty ray of light from the window, there was a sack of coarse cloth, under the broad folds of which one could vaguely distinguish a long, stiff shape: this was Faria's last winding-sheet which, according to the turnkeys, had cost so little. So all was finished. Between Dantès and his old friend there was already a gulf: he could no longer see those eyes, wide open as if looking beyond death; he could no longer clasp that industrious hand which for him had lifted the veil that covered arcane matters. Faria, that good and valuable companion to whom he had become so strongly attached, now existed only in his memory. He sat down at the head of this awful bed and lapsed into a deep and bitter melancholy.</div>

<div class="line_en">Alone, he no longer had even the sight or the sound of the voice of the only human being who still bound him to the earth! Would it not be better for him, like Faria, to go and ask God to explain the enigma of life, even at the risk of passing through the dark gate of suffering? The idea of suicide had been driven away by his friend's presence, but returned like a ghost and rose up beside Faria's corpse.</div>

<div class="line_en">"If I could die," he said, "I should go where he has gone and I should certainly find him again. But how can I die? It is easy," he added, laughing. "I have only to remain here, throw myself on the first person who enters and strangle him; they will guillotine me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“假如我死了，”他说，“我就可以到他所去的地方，一定可以找到他。但怎么死法呢？这是非常容易的，”他带着一个痛苦的微笑继续说，“我就呆在这儿，谁第一个来开门，我就向他冲上去，捏死他，这样他们就会把我送上断头台了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But, as often happens, in great sorrow as in great storms, the abyss lies between the crests of two waves; Dantès shrank from the idea of so dishonourable a death and rapidly went from this feeling of despair to a burning thirst for life and freedom.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但人在极度悲痛之中，也象在大风暴里一样，深渊是夹在最高的浪头之中的，邓蒂斯这时也从这种可耻的求死的念头上反冲回来，突然从绝望转变到一种热烈的求生和自由的愿望。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Die! No, no!" he cried. "It was not worth living so long, and suffering so much, to die now. Death was welcome previously, when I made a resolution to meet it, many years ago. But now it would truly be conceding too much to my miserable fate. No, I want to live, I want to struggle to the end. No, I want to recover the happiness that has been taken away from me. I am forgetting that, before I die, I have my enemies to punish and, who knows? -- perhaps a few friends to reward. But now that I am forgotten here, I shall not escape my dungeon except in the same way as Faria."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“死！噢，不！”他喊道，“现在还不能死，我已经活了这末久，受苦了这末久！几年以前，当我存心想死的时候死，或许还好，但现在这样做，就等于自己让步，承认我的苦命了。不，我要活，我要奋斗到最后一口气，我要重新去寻找我被剥夺的幸福。我不能死，在死以前，我还有几个陷害我的刽子手要去惩罚，或许，谁能料得定呢，还有几个朋友要报答。但是我现在倒忘掉啦，我只能象法利亚一样的走出我的黑牢了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At these words, Edmond remained motionless, his gaze fixed, like a man who has suddenly been struck by an idea, but one that appals him. At once he got up, put his hand on his forehead as if suffering from dizziness, walked around the room two or three times and returned to the bed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="说到这里，他身子一动不动，眼睛一眨都不眨，好象突然有了一个极其惊人的想法。他猛然站起身来，举手扶住额头，象是脑子已在晕眩似的。他在房间里转了两三圈，突然在床前站下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Ah!" he exclaimed. "Where did that idea come from? From you, God? Since only the dead leave this place freely, let us take the place of the dead." And, without wasting any time in reconsidering the decision, as if to avoid giving his thoughts the opportunity to annihilate his desperate resolve, he bent over the ghastly sack, opened it with the knife that Faria had made, removed the body, dragged it into his own cell, put it in his bed, covered its head with the scrap of linen that he was accustomed to wear on his own, drew his blanket over it, kissed its icy brow for the last time and tried to close the eyes, which still remained stubbornly open, terrifying because there was no thought behind them. After that, he turned the head to the wall so that the jailer, when he brought the evening meal, would think that he was asleep, as quite often happened; then he returned to the tunnel, dragged the bed against the wall, went back to the other cell, took the needle and thread out of the wardrobe, threw off his rags so that they would feel naked flesh under the cloth, slipped into the empty sack, lay down in the same position as the body, and sewed it up from inside.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“啊！啊！”他自言自语地说，“是谁使我有这个想法的？是您吗，慈悲的上帝？既然只有死人才能自由地离开这个黑牢，那末我就来装死吧！”他不让自己有片刻时间来考虑这个决定，真的，要是他仔细想一想，他这种决心或许会动摇的。他弯身凑到那张可怕的布袋前面，用法利亚制造的小刀将它割开，把尸体从口袋里拖出来，再把它背到自己的地牢里，把它放在自己的睡榻上，用自己晚上包头的那块布给它包了头，再吻了一次那冰冷的额头，几次徒劳地想去闭上那依旧开着的眼睛，把头转向墙壁，这样，当狱卒拿晚餐来的时候，会以为他已经睡着了，这也是常事，于是，折入地道，把床拖过来靠住墙壁，回到那个地牢里，从贮藏处拿出针线，脱掉他破烂的衣衫，以便使他们一摸就知道粗糙的口袋底下确是裸体的尸身，然后钻进口袋，使自己躺在他们放尸体的地位，在口袋里面把袋口缝起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="假如狱卒不巧在这时进来，或许会听到他心跳的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dantès could easily have waited until after the evening visit, but he was afraid that between now and then the governor might change his mind and take away the body. In that case, his last hope would be gone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="邓蒂斯本来可以等七点钟的一次查看过了以后再这样做的，但他怕堡长改变决定，吩咐把尸体提早搬开，假若如此，他最后的一个希望都要毁了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">If they took him to the burial ground and put him in a grave, he would allow himself to be covered with earth; then, since it was night, the gravediggers would hardly have turned their backs before he would tunnel out of the soft earth and escape. He hoped the soil would not be too heavy for him to lift it. If he was wrong and the earth proved to be too heavy, he would suffocate, and so much the better: all would be over!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="假如他们把他扛到坟场上，把他放在坟墓里，他就让他们在他的身上盖土，因为在夜里，只要那掘墓人一转身，他就可以从那松软的泥土里爬出来逃走。他希望所盖的泥土不要太重，使他受不了。假如不幸，那泥土如果太重，那他就会被压死在里面，那样也好，也可一了百了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">If, during the journey out of the cell, the gravediggers realized that they were carrying a living man instead of a corpse, Dantès would not give them time to gather their wits. He would split the sack from top to bottom with a sharp lunge of the knife and take advantage of their terror to escape. If they tried to stop him, he would use the knife.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="假如在扛出去的途中，被掘墓人发觉他们所抬的不是一具尸体而是一个活人，则邓蒂斯决不让他们认出是谁，就用小刀把口袋从头到底划破，乘他们在惊惶失措的时候逃走。假如他们想来捉他，他就要用那把小刀了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As seven o'clock approached, Dantès began to suffer in earnest. One hand was pressed against his heart, attempting to stifle its beating while the other wiped the sweat from his brow as it streamed along his temples. From time to time, a shudder would run through his whole body and seize his heart in an icy grip; at such moments he thought he would die. The hours passed without bringing any sound of movement in the fortress and Dantès realized that he had escaped the first danger, which was a good sign. Finally, at around the time appointed by the governor, footsteps were heard in the stairway. Edmond realized that the moment had come. He summoned up all his courage, holding his breath; he would have been happier could he have stifled the beating of his pulse in the same way.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当七点钟来临的时候，邓蒂斯的痛苦真正开始了。他把一只手压在心上，但却不能制住它的剧跳，另一只手则不断地去抹太阳穴上的冷汗。他全身打起阵阵寒颤，心脏突然受着紧压，象是被一只冰冷的手抓住了似的。那时，他以为自己快要死了。可是，几点钟过去了，堡里毫无动静，邓蒂斯觉得他已逃过了第一重危险，这是一个好兆头。终于，约莫在堡长所指定的那个时间，楼梯上有了脚步声。爱德蒙知道时机已到，就集中他的全部勇气，屏住自己的呼吸，他真希望能同时制住他脉搏的急促的跳动。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The first danger that threatened was that the jailer, bringing him his supper at seven o'clock, would notice the substitution; luckily Dantès had many times received the jailer's visit lying down, either through misanthropy or fatigue. In such cases the man usually put the bread and soup on the table and left without speaking to him. This time, however, the jailer might lapse from his habitual silence, say something and, when Dantès did not reply, go over to the bed and discover the deception.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="邓蒂斯所冒的第一重危险是：当狱卒在七点钟给他拿晚餐来的时候，或许会发觉他的掉包计。幸而，至少有二十次了，为了怕麻烦或是为了疲倦，邓蒂斯曾这样躺在床上迎接他的狱卒。每逢这样的时候，那人就把他的面包和汤放在桌子上，然后一言不发的走了。这一次，狱卒或许不会象往常那样沉默，他或许会和邓蒂斯讲话，而看到他不回答，或许会走到床边去看看，就此把一切都发觉了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dantès had not eaten since the previous day, but he had not thought of his hunger that morning, and he still did not notice it. His position was too precarious for him to waste time on thinking of anything else.</div>

<div class="line_en">The door opened and a muffled light reached Dantès' eyes. Through the cloth covering him he saw two shapes approach the bed. At the door was a third, carrying a lantern. The two who had come over to the bed each grasped one end of the sack.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="门开了，一片昏暗的光透过粗布，传到邓蒂斯的眼睛里。他看到两个黑影朝他的床边走过来，第三个人留在门口，手里举着火炬。这两个人分别走到床的两头，各人扛起布袋的一端。">查看中文翻译</div>
