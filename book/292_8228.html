<div class="line_en">The front door of the hollow tree faced eastwards, so Toad was called at an early hour; partly by the bright sunlight streaming in on him, partly by the exceeding coldness of his toes, which made him dream that he was at home in bed in his own handsome room with the Tudor window, on a cold winter's night, and his bedclothes had got up, grumbling and protesting they couldn't stand the cold any longer, and had run downstairs to the kitchen fire to warm themselves; and he had followed, on bare feet, along miles and miles of icy stone-paved passages, arguing and beseeching them to be reasonable. He would probably have been aroused much earlier, had he not slept for some weeks on straw over stone flags, and almost forgotten the friendly feeling of thick blankets pulled well up round the chin.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sitting up, he rubbed his eyes first and his complaining toes next, wondered for a moment where he was, looking round for familiar stone wall and little barred window; then, with a leap of the heart, remembered everything-his escape, his flight, his pursuit; remembered, first and best thing of all, that he was free!</div>

<div class="line_en">Free! The word and the thought alone were worth fifty blankets. He was warm from end to end as he thought of the jolly world outside, waiting eagerly for him to make his triumphal entrance, ready to serve him and play up to him, anxious to help him and to keep him company, as it always had been in days of old before misfortune fell upon him. He shook himself and combed the dry leaves out of his hair with his fingers; and, his toilet complete, marched forth into the comfortable morning sun, cold but confident, hungry but hopeful, all nervous terrors of yesterday dispelled by rest and sleep and frank and heartening sunshine.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="自由！单是这个字眼和这个念头，就值五十条毛毯。外面那个欢乐的世界，正热切地等待他的胜利归来，准备为他效劳，向他讨好，急着给他帮助，给他作伴，就像他遭到不幸前的那些老时光一样。想到这，他感到通身热乎乎的。他抖了抖身子，用爪子梳理掉毛发里的枯树叶。梳洗完毕，他大步走进舒适的早晨的阳光，虽然冷，但充满信心，虽然饿，但充满希望。昨天的紧张恐惧，全都被一夜的休息睡眠和诚恳热情的阳光一扫而光。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He had the world all to himself, that early summer morning. The dewy woodland, as he threaded it, was solitary and still: the green fields that succeeded the trees were his own to do as he liked with; the road itself, when he reached it, in that loneliness that was everywhere, seemed, like a stray dog, to be looking anxiously for company. Toad, however, was looking for something that could talk, and tell him clearly which way he ought to go. It is all very well, when you have a light heart, and a clear conscience, and money in your pocket, and nobody scouring the country for you to drag you off to prison again, to follow where the road beckons and points, not caring whither. The practical Toad cared very much indeed, and he could have kicked the road for its helpless silence when every minute was of importance to him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在这个夏天的早晨，周围整个世界都属于他一人。他穿过带露的树林时，林中静悄悄。走出树林，绿色的田野也都属他一人，随他想干什么。来到路上，到处是冷冷清清．那条路像一只迷途的狗，正急着要寻个伴儿。蟾蜍呢，他却在寻找一个会说话的东西，能指点他该往哪去。是啊，要是一个人轻松自在，心里没鬼，兜里有钱，又没人四处搜捕你，要抓你回监狱，那么你信步走来，随便走哪条路，上哪里去，都一个样。可讲实际的蟾蜍却忧心忡忡，每分钟对他来说都事关重要，而那条路却硬是不开口，你拿它毫无办法，恨不得喘它几脚才解气。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Round a bend in the canal came plodding a solitary horse, stooping forward as if in anxious thought. From rope traces attached to his collar stretched a long line, taut, but dipping with his stride, the further part of it dripping pearly drops. Toad let the horse pass, and stood waiting for what the fates were sending him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="绕过一个河湾，只见走过来一匹孤零零的马，那马向前佝偻着身子，像在焦虑地思考什么。一根长绳连着他的轭具，拽得紧紧的，马往前走时，绳子不住地滴水，较远的一端更是掉着珍珠般的水滴。蟾蜍让过马，站着等候，看命运会给他送来什么。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The reserved rustic road was presently joined by a shy little brother in the shape of a canal, which took its hand and ambled along by its side in perfect confidence, but with the same tongue-tied, uncommunicative attitude towards strangers. 'Bother them!' said Toad to himself. 'But, anyhow, one thing's clear. They must both be coming FROM somewhere, and going TO somewhere. You can't get over that. Toad, my boy!' So he marched on patiently by the water's edge.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个沉默不语的乡间道路，不一会就有了一个怯生生的小兄弟，一条小渠。它和道路手拉手，肩并肩慢慢往前走，它对道路绝对信赖，可对陌生人都同样闭紧了嘴，一声不吭。“真讨厌！”蟾蜍自言自语说。“不过有一点是清楚的，它俩一定是从什么地方来，到什么地方去的。这一点，蟾蜍，小伙子，你总没法否认吧。”于是他耐着性子沿着小渠大步朝前走去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">With a pleasant swirl of quiet water at its blunt bow the barge slid up alongside of him, its gaily painted gunwale level with the towing-path, its sole occupant a big stout woman wearing a linen sun-bonnet, one brawny arm laid along the tiller.</div>

Here's my married daughter, she sends off to me post-haste to come to her at once; so off I comes, not knowing what may be happening or going to happen, but fearing the worst, as you will understand, ma'am, if you're a mother, too. And I've left my business to look after itself-I'm in the washing and laundering line, you must know, ma'am-and I've left my young children to look after themselves, and a more mischievous and troublesome set of young imps doesn't exist, ma'am; and I've lost all my money, and lost my way, and as for what may be happening to my married daughter, why, I don't like to think of it, ma'am!'</div>

<div class="line_en">'Well, look at me, now,' replied the barge-woman. '_I_ like washing, too, just the same as you do; and for that matter, whether I like it or not I have got to do all my own, naturally, moving about as I do. Now my husband, he's such a fellow for shirking his work and leaving the barge to me, that never a moment do I get for seeing to my own affairs. By rights he ought to be here now, either steering or attending to the horse, though luckily the horse has sense enough to attend to himself. Instead of which, he's gone off with the dog, to see if they can't pick up a rabbit for dinner somewhere. Says he'll catch me up at the next lock. Well, that's as may be-I don't trust him, once he gets off with that dog, who's worse than he is. But meantime, how am I to get on with my washing?'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嗯，是这样，你瞧，”船娘说。“我跟你一样，也喜欢洗衣。其实，不管喜欢不喜欢，自家的衣裳，自然我都得自己洗，尽管我来来去去转游。我丈夫呢，是那样一种人，老是偷懒，他把船交给我来管，所以，我哪有时间料理自家的事。按理。这会儿他该来这儿，要么掌舵。要么牵马——幸亏那马还算听话，懂得自个儿管自个儿。可我丈夫他没来，他带上狗打猎去啦，看能不能打上只兔子做午饭。说他在下道水闸那边援我碰头。也许吧——可我信不过他。他只要带上狗出去，就说不好了——那狗比他还要坏……可这么一来，我又怎么洗我的衣裳呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">'I can't fix my mind on anything but my washing,' said the barge-woman, 'and I wonder you can be talking of rabbits, with such a joyful prospect before you. There's a heap of things of mine that you'll find in a corner of the cabin. If you'll just take one or two of the most necessary sort-I won't venture to describe them to a lady like you, but you'll recognise them at a glance-and put them through the wash-tub as we go along, why, it'll be a pleasure to you, as you rightly say, and a real help to me. You'll find a tub handy, and soap, and a kettle on the stove, and a bucket to haul up water from the canal with. Then I shall know you're enjoying yourself, instead of sitting here idle, looking at the scenery and yawning your head off.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“除了洗衣，我什么也不能想，”船娘说。“真不明白，眼前就有一件美差在等着你，你怎么还有闲情谈兔子。船舱的一角，有我一大堆脏衣裳。你只消捡出几件急需先洗的东西——那是什么，我不好跟你这样一位太太直说，可你一眼就瞅得出来——把它们浸在盆里。你说过，那对你是一种愉快，对我是一种实际帮助。洗衣盆是现成的，还有肥皂，炉子上有水壶，还有一只桶，可以从渠里打水。那样。你就会过得很快活，免得像现在这样呆坐着，闲得无聊，只好看风景，打呵欠。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Toad was fairly cornered. He looked for escape this way and that, saw that he was too far from the bank for a flying leap, and sullenly resigned himself to his fate. 'If it comes to that,' he thought in desperation, 'I suppose any fool can WASH!'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="蟾蜍这下给逼进了死胡同。他东张西望，想夺路逃走，但是离岸太远，飞跃过去是不可能的，只好闷闷不乐地屈从命运的安排。“既然被逼到了这一步，”他无可奈何地想，“我相信，洗衣这种活哪个笨蛋也能干！”">查看中文翻译</div>

No, you shall do the washing you are so fond of, and I'll stick to the steering that I understand. Don't try and deprive me of the pleasure of giving you a treat!'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“让你掌舵？”船娘大笑着说。“给一条拖船掌舵，得有经验。再说，这活很没趣味，我想让你高兴。不不，还是你干你喜欢的洗衣活，我干我熟悉的掌舵好。我要好好款待你一番，别辜负我的好意！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A long half-hour passed, and every minute of it saw Toad getting crosser and crosser. Nothing that he could do to the things seemed to please them or do them good. He tried coaxing, he tried slapping, he tried punching; they smiled back at him out of the tub unconverted, happy in their original sin. Once or twice he looked nervously over his shoulder at the barge-woman, but she appeared to be gazing out in front of her, absorbed in her steering. His back ached badly, and he noticed with dismay that his paws were beginning to get all crinkly. Now Toad was very proud of his paws. He muttered under his breath words that should never pass the lips of either washerwomen or Toads; and lost the soap, for the fiftieth time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="好长好长的半个钟头过去了，每过一分钟，蟾蜍就变得更加恼火。不管他怎样努力，总讨不到那些衣物的欢心，和它们搞不好关系。他把它们又哄，又拧，又搧耳光，可它们只是从盆里冲他嬉皮笑脸。心安理得地守住它们的原罪，毫无悔改之意。有一两次，他紧张地回头望了望那船娘，可她似乎只顾凝望前方，一门心思在掌舵。他的腰背酸痛得厉害；两只爪子给泡得皱巴巴的。而这双爪子是他一向特别珍爱的。他低声嘟囔了几句既不该洗衣妇也不该蟾蜍说的话，第五十次掉了肥皂。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Toad never paused to reply. Solid revenge was what he wanted, not cheap, windy, verbal triumphs, though he had a thing or two in his mind that he would have liked to say. He saw what he wanted ahead of him. Running swiftly on he overtook the horse, unfastened the towrope and cast off, jumped lightly on the horse's back, and urged it to a gallop by kicking it vigorously in the sides. He steered for the open country, abandoning the tow-path, and swinging his steed down a rutty lane. Once he looked back, and saw that the barge had run aground on the other side of the canal, and the barge-woman was gesticulating wildly and shouting, 'Stop, stop, stop!' 'I've heard that song before,' said Toad, laughing, as he continued to spur his steed onward in its wild career.</div>

<div class="line_en">The barge-horse was not capable of any very sustained effort, and its gallop soon subsided into a trot, and its trot into an easy walk; but Toad was quite contented with this, knowing that he, at any rate, was moving, and the barge was not. He had quite recovered his temper, now that he had done something he thought really clever; and he was satisfied to jog along quietly in the sun, steering his horse along by-ways and bridle-paths, and trying to forget how very long it was since he had had a square meal, till the canal had been left very far behind him.</div>

<div class="line_en">He had travelled some miles, his horse and he, and he was feeling drowsy in the hot sunshine, when the horse stopped, lowered his head, and began to nibble the grass; and Toad, waking up, just saved himself from falling off by an effort. He looked about him and found he was on a wide common, dotted with patches of gorse and bramble as far as he could see. Near him stood a dingy gipsy caravan, and beside it a man was sitting on a bucket turned upside down, very busy smoking and staring into the wide world. A fire of sticks was burning near by, and over the fire hung an iron pot, and out of that pot came forth bubblings and gurglings, and a vague suggestive steaminess. Also smells-warm, rich, and varied smells-that twined and twisted and wreathed themselves at last into one complete, voluptuous, perfect smell that seemed like the very soul of Nature taking form and appearing to her children, a true Goddess, a mother of solace and comfort. Toad now knew well that he had not been really hungry before. What he had felt earlier in the day had been a mere trifling qualm. This was the real thing at last, and no mistake; and it would have to be dealt with speedily, too, or there would be trouble for somebody or something. He looked the gipsy over carefully, wondering vaguely whether it would be easier to fight him or cajole him. So there he sat, and sniffed and sniffed, and looked at the gipsy; and the gipsy sat and smoked, and looked at him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他和马已经走了好几哩路。炙热的太阳晒得他昏昏欲睡。那马忽然停下来，低头啃吃青草。蟾蜍惊醒过来，险些儿掉下马背。他举目四顾，只见自己是在一片宽阔的公地上，一眼望去，地上星星点点缀满了金雀花和黑麦子。离他不远的地方，停着一辆破烂的吉卜赛大篷车，一个男人坐在车旁一只倒扣着的桶上，一个劲抽烟，眺望着广阔的天地。附近燃着一堆树枝生起的火，火上吊着一只铁罐，里面发生咕嘟嘟的冒泡声，一股淡淡的蒸汽，令人不禁想入非非。还有气味——暖暖的、浓浓的、杂七杂八的气味——互相掺合、交织，整个儿融成一股无比诱人的香味，就像大自然女神——一位给孩子们慰安和鼓舞的母亲——的灵魂显了形，召唤着她的儿女们。蟾蜍现在才明自，他原先并不知道什么叫真正的饿。上半天感到的饥饿，只不过是一阵微不足道的眩晕罢了。现在，真正的饥饿终于来了，没错；而且得赶紧认真对待才行，要不然，就会给什么人或什么东西带来麻烦。他仔细打量那个吉卜赛人、心里举棋不定，不知道是跟他死打硬拼好，还是甜言蜜语哄骗好。所以他就坐在马背上，用鼻子嗅了又嗅，盯着吉卜赛人。吉卜赛人也坐着，抽烟，拿眼盯着他。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then Toad sat and pondered long and deeply. For he was hungry and quite penniless, and still some way-he knew not how far-from home, and enemies might still be looking for him. To one in such a situation, five shillings may very well appear a large sum of money. On the other hand, it did not seem very much to get for a horse. But then, again, the horse hadn't cost him anything; so whatever he got was all clear profit. At last he said firmly, 'Look here, gipsy! I tell you what we will do; and this is MY last word. You shall hand me over six shillings and sixpence, cash down; and further, in addition thereto, you shall give me as much breakfast as I can possibly eat, at one sitting of course, out of that iron pot of yours that keeps sending forth such delicious and exciting smells. In return, I will make over to you my spirited young horse, with all the beautiful harness and trappings that are on him, freely thrown in.

<div class="line_en">The gipsy grumbled frightfully, and declared if he did a few more deals of that sort he'd be ruined. But in the end he lugged a dirty canvas bag out of the depths of his trouser pocket, and counted out six shillings and sixpence into Toad's paw. Then he disappeared into the caravan for an instant, and returned with a large iron plate and a knife, fork, and spoon. He tilted up the pot, and a glorious stream of hot rich stew gurgled into the plate. It was, indeed, the most beautiful stew in the world, being made of partridges, and pheasants, and chickens, and hares, and rabbits, and pea-hens, and guinea-fowls, and one or two other things. Toad took the plate on his lap, almost crying, and stuffed, and stuffed, and stuffed, and kept asking for more, and the gipsy never grudged it him. He thought that he had never eaten so good a breakfast in all his life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉卜赛人大发牢骚，抱怨说，这样的买卖要是再做几宗，他就要倾家荡产啦。不过最终他还是从裤兜深处掏出一只脏兮兮的小帆布包，数出六枚先令六枚便士，放在蟾蜍掌心里。然后他钻进大篷车，拿出一只大铁盘，一副刀、叉、勺子。他歪倒铁锅，于是一大股热腾腾、油汪汪的杂烩汤就流进了铁盘。那果真是世上最最美味的杂烩汤，是用松鸡、野鸡、家鸡、野兔、家兔、雌孔雀、珍珠鸡，还有一两样别的东西烩在一起熬成的。蟾蜍接过盘子，放在膝上，差点儿没哭出来。他一个劲往肚里填呀。填呀，填呀，吃完又要，吃完又要；而吉卜赛人也不吝啬。蟾蜍觉得，他这辈子从没吃过这么美味的一顿早餐。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When Toad had taken as much stew on board as he thought he could possibly hold, he got up and said good-bye to the gipsy, and took an affectionate farewell of the horse; and the gipsy, who knew the riverside well, gave him directions which way to go, and he set forth on his travels again in the best possible spirits. He was, indeed, a very different Toad from the animal of an hour ago. The sun was shining brightly, his wet clothes were quite dry again, he had money in his pocket once more, he was nearing home and friends and safety, and, most and best of all, he had had a substantial meal, hot and nourishing, and felt big, and strong, and careless, and self-confident.</div>

'Ho, ho!' he said to himself as he marched along with his chin in the air, 'what a clever Toad I am! There is surely no animal equal to me for cleverness in the whole world! My enemies shut me up in prison, encircled by sentries, watched night and day by warders; I walk out through them all, by sheer ability coupled with courage. They pursue me with engines, and policemen, and revolvers; I snap my fingers at them, and vanish, laughing, into space. I am, unfortunately, thrown into a canal by a woman fat of body and very evil-minded. What of it? I swim ashore, I seize her horse, I ride off in triumph, and I sell the horse for a whole pocketful of money and an excellent breakfast! Ho, ho! I am The Toad, the handsome, the popular, the successful Toad!'

<div class="line_en">The terrible motor-car drew slowly nearer and nearer, till at last he heard it stop just short of him. Two gentlemen got out and walked round the trembling heap of crumpled misery lying in the road, and one of them said, 'O dear! this is very sad! Here is a poor old thing-a washerwoman apparently-who has fainted in the road! Perhaps she is overcome by the heat, poor creature; or possibly she has not had any food to-day. Let us lift her into the car and take her to the nearest village, where doubtless she has friends.'</div>

<div class="line_en">Toad eagerly scrambled into the seat vacated by the driver, took the steering-wheel in his hands, listened with affected humility to the instructions given him, and set the car in motion, but very slowly and carefully at first, for he was determined to be prudent. The gentlemen behind clapped their hands and applauded, and Toad heard them saying, 'How well she does it! Fancy a washerwoman driving a car as well as that, the first time!'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这话使蟾蜍大喜过望。他急不可耐地爬进司机让出来的座位，双手握住方向盘，佯作谦逊地听从司机的指点，开动了汽车，起初开得很慢很小心，因为他决心要谨慎行事。后座的绅士们拍手称赞说：“她开得多好啊！想不到一个洗衣妇开车能开得这么棒，从没见过！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The driver tried to interfere, but he pinned him down in his seat with one elbow, and put on full speed. The rush of air in his face, the hum of the engines, and the light jump of the car beneath him intoxicated his weak brain. 'Washerwoman, indeed!' he shouted recklessly. 'Ho! ho! I am the Toad, the motor-car snatcher, the prison-breaker, the Toad who always escapes!

<div class="line_en">He picked himself up rapidly, and set off running across country as hard as he could, scrambling through hedges, jumping ditches, pounding across fields, till he was breathless and weary, and had to settle down into an easy walk. When he had recovered his breath somewhat, and was able to think calmly, he began to giggle, and from giggling he took to laughing, and he laughed till he had to sit down under a hedge. 'Ho, ho!' he cried, in ecstasies of self-admiration, 'Toad again! Toad, as usual, comes out on the top! Who was it got them to give him a lift? Who managed to get on the front seat for the sake of fresh air? Who persuaded them into letting him see if he could drive? Who landed them all in a horse-pond? Who escaped, flying gaily and unscathed through the air, leaving the narrow-minded, grudging, timid excursionists in the mud where they should rightly be?

<div class="line_en">Toad found himself flying through the air with the strong upward rush and delicate curve of a swallow. He liked the motion, and was just beginning to wonder whether it would go on until he developed wings and turned into a Toad-bird, when he landed on his back with a thump, in the soft rich grass of a meadow. Sitting up, he could just see the motor-car in the pond, nearly submerged; the gentlemen and the driver, encumbered by their long coats, were floundering helplessly in the water.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="蟾蜍觉得自己突然往上一窜，像只燕子在空中划了一道优美的弧线。他颇喜欢这动作，心里正纳闷，不知会不会继续这样飞下去，直到长出翅膀，变成一只蟾蜍鸟。就在这一刹，砰地一声，他仰面朝天着了陆，落在丰茂松软的草地上。他坐起来，一眼看到水塘里那辆汽车，快要沉下去了；绅士们和司机被他们身上的长外套拖累着，正无可奈何地在水里扑腾挣扎。">查看中文翻译</div>

Ceasing to heed where he was going, he struggled on blindly and wildly, looking back over his shoulder at the now triumphant enemy, when suddenly the earth failed under his feet, he grasped at the air, and, splash! he found himself head over ears in deep water, rapid water, water that bore him along with a force he could not contend with; and he knew that in his blind panic he had run straight into the river!</div>

<div class="line_en">He rose to the surface and tried to grasp the reeds and the rushes that grew along the water's edge close under the bank, but the stream was so strong that it tore them out of his hands. 'O my!' gasped poor Toad, 'if ever I steal a motor-car again! If ever I sing another conceited song' -- then down he went, and came up breathless and spluttering. Presently he saw that he was approaching a big dark hole in the bank, just above his head, and as the stream bore him past he reached up with a paw and caught hold of the edge and held on. Then slowly and with difficulty he drew himself up out of the water, till at last he was able to rest his elbows on the edge of the hole. There he remained for some minutes, puffing and panting, for he was quite exhausted.</div>
