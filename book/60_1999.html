<div class="line_en">He was sitting at the desk where he usually read his books, an open envelope with a letter in it lying in front of him. From time to time I get letters I haven't told you about, he said to Tereza. They're from my son. I've tried to keep his life and mine completely separate, and look how fate is getting even with me. A few years ago he was expelled from the university. Now he drives a tractor in a village. Our lives may be separate, but they run in the same direction, like parallel lines.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“那么，就问他好了！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">No, not in the least. He believes in God and thinks that that's the key. He says we should all live our daily lives according to the dictates of religion and pay no heed to the regime, completely ignore it. If we believe in God, he claims, we can take any situation and, by means of our own behavior, transform it into what he calls 'the kingdom of God on earth.' He tells me that the Church is the only voluntary association in ourcountry which eludes the control of the state. I wonder whether he's joined the Church because it helps him to oppose the regime or because he really believes in God.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，丝毫没有妥协。他是个教徒，他认为宗教是万能钥匙。在他看来，我们每人都应当无视当局、遵循教规过普通生活。应该无视当局。他认为，只要信仰上帝，就可以在任何情况下以自己的行为，创建他所说的‘尘世间的上帝之国’。他告诉我说，教会是我们国家惟一摆脱国家控制的自愿者协会。我总在问自己，他到底是为了抵制当局而信教呢，还是真的信教。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I used to admire believers, Tomas continued. I thought they had an odd transcendental way of perceiving things which was closed to me. Like clairvoyants, you might say. But my son's experience proves that faith is actually quite a simple matter. He was down and out, the Catholics took him in, and before he knew it, he had faith. So it was gratitude that decided the issue, most likely. Human decisions are terribly simple.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="托马斯接着说：“我始终钦佩有宗教信仰的人。我以前觉得他们都具有我所缺乏的奇特、超凡的感受禀赋。有点像是通灵者。可是从我儿子的例子来看，我现在发现，成为一名教徒其实是很简单的。当一个人处于困境中，一些天主教徒便去关心他，他一下子就发现了信仰。也许他是出于感激而决定入教的。人类的决定往往草率得可怕。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Frankly, I have stage fright at the thought of meeting him. That's the main reason I haven't done anything about it.

<div class="line_en">She could not tear her eyes away from him: he looked like an old man. His hair had gone gray, and his lack of coordination was not that of a surgeon turned driver but of a man no longer young.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特蕾莎站在那儿，无法将目光挪开：托马斯确实老了。他头发灰白，干起活来动作笨拙，当然不是由医生转行当卡车司机显示出的笨手笨脚，而是一个步入老年的男人所表现的迟钝。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She recalled a recent talk with the chairman of the collective farm. He had told her that Tomas's pickup was in miserable condition. He said it as a joke, not a complaint, but she could tell he was concerned. Tomas knows the insides of the body better than the insides of an engine, he said with a laugh. He then confessed that he had made several visits to the authorities to request permission for Tomas to resume his medical practice, if only locally. He had learned that the police would never grant it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她想起不久前与合作社主席的一次谈话。主席告诉她托马斯开的卡车的车况很糟糕。他说这话像是开玩笑，并没有埋怨的意思，可他毕竟有些担心。他还笑着说：“托马斯对人体对比发动机要懂行多了。”他还向她透露，他曾向当地政府多次交涉，想让托马斯在当地行医。他后来听说，警方是决不会准许的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She had stepped behind a tree trunk so that none of the men by the pickup could see her. Standing there observing him, she suffered a bout of self-recrimination: It was her fault that he had come back to Prague from Zurich, her fault that he had left Prague, and even here she could not leave him in peace, torturing him with her secret suspicions while Karenin lay dying.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="为了不让卡车周围的人看见，特蕾莎躲到一个树干后，但她的眼睛始终盯着托马斯。她深感内疚，都是因为她，托马斯才离开苏黎世回到布拉格，又为了她而离开布拉格，甚至在这里，她还继续烦他，甚至当着奄奄一息的卡列宁的面，虽然没明说，但还猜疑、折磨他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That afternoon she was on her way back from the cow sheds when she heard voices from the road. Coming closer, she saw Tomas's pickup. Tomas was bent over, changing a tire, while some of the men stood about looking on and waiting for him to finish.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="下午，从牛棚回来时，特蕾莎听见马路上有人说话。她走了过去，见托马斯的卡车停在那儿。托马斯正弯腰拆卸一只轮胎，一群人围着他看，等着他把车修好。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Now she saw that she had been unfair: If she had really loved Tomas with a great love, she would have stuck it out with him abroad! Tomas had been happy there; a new life was opening for him! And she had left him! True, at the time she had convinced herself she was being magnanimous, giving him his freedom. But hadn't her magnanimity been merely an excuse? She knew all along that he would come home to her! She had summoned him farther and farther down after her like the nymphs who lured unsuspecting villagers to the marshes and left them there to drown. She had taken advantage of a night of stomach cramps to inveigle him into moving to the country! How cunning she could be! She had summoned him to follow her as if wishing to test him again and again, to test his love for her; she had summoned him persistently, and here he was, tired and gray, with stiffened fingers that would never again be capable of holding a scalpel.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在，她明白自己是多么没有道理：如果她真的很爱托马斯，那她就应该和他一起留在国外！那儿，托马斯是幸福的，新的生活展现在他面前。而她却离开了他，独自出走了！当然，她当时自以为这样做是出于好意，是不想成为他的负担！可是这种好意难道不是遁词吗？其实她知道托马斯会回来，会来找她的！是她在唤他，拖累他，一步步把他往底层拖，就像仙女把农夫引入泥炭沼，让他们淹死在那儿。她利用托马斯胃痉挛的那一瞬间，骗取他发誓与她去乡下定居！她真够狡猾的！每次她叫托马斯追随自己，目的都是为了考验他，为了证实他是否确实爱她，以至于把托马斯拖到这个地步：头发花白，精疲力竭，指头僵直，再也握不住外科医生的解剖刀了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She went home and drew a bath. Lying in the hot water, she kept telling herself that she had set a lifetime of her weaknesses against Tomas. We all have a tendency to consider strength the culprit and weakness the innocent victim. But now Tereza realized that in her case the opposite was true! Even her dreams, as if aware of the single weakness in a man otherwise strong, made a display of her suffering to him, thereby forcing him to retreat. Her weakness was aggressive and kept forcing him to capitulate until eventually he lost his strength and was transformed into the rabbit in her arms. She could not get that dream out of her mind.</div>

<div class="line_en">That's a silly comparison to make, said Tereza. Your work meant everything to you; I don't care what I do, I can do anything, I haven't lost a thing; you've lost everything.</div>

<div class="line_en">There was no doubting that forthright voice of his. She recalled the scene she had witnessed earlier in the day when he had been repairing the pickup and looked so old. She had reached her goal: she had always wanted him to be old. Again she thought of the rabbit she had pressed to her face in her childhood room.</div>

<div class="line_en">On they danced to the strains of the piano and violin. Tereza leaned her head on Tomas's shoulder. Just as she had when they flew together in the airplane through the storm clouds. She was experiencing the same odd happiness and odd sadness as then. The sadness meant: we are at the last station. The happiness meant: we are together. The sadness was form, the happiness content. Happiness filled the space of sadness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们来来回回，合着钢琴声和小提琴声迈着舞步，特蕾莎的头靠在托马斯的肩上，两人就像坐着飞机在云雾里穿行。此刻她又感受到了坐在飞机上的那种奇特的幸福，那种奇特的忧虑。这忧虑意味着：我们已在最后的一站。这幸福意味着：我们在一起。忧虑是形式，幸福是内容。幸福充盈着忧虑的空间。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tomas turned the key and switched on the ceiling light. Tereza saw two beds pushed together, one of them flanked by a bedside table and lamp. Up out of the lampshade, startled by the overhead light, flew a large nocturnal butterfly that began circling the room. The strains of the piano and violin rose up weakly from below.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="托马斯打开房间的门，揿亮了吊灯。特蕾莎看见两张床对放着，一张床边有一个带灯的床头柜。一只巨大的蝴蝶被光线一惊，飞离灯罩，在房间里盘旋。下面，传来钢琴和小提琴微弱的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>
