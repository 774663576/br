<div class="line_en">Jan leaned against the elephant and rested his hands on the skin, rough as the bark of a tree. He looked at the great tusks and the curving trunk, caught by the skill of the taxidermist in the moment of challenge or salutation. What still weirder creatures, he wondered, from what unknown worlds would one day be looking at this exile from Earth?</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你给外星人送去了多少动物？”他问鲁柏特。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"At least fifty, though of course this is the biggest one. He's magnificent, isn't he? Most of the others have been quite small-butterflies, snakes, monkeys, and so on. Though I did get a hippo last year."</div>

<div class="line_en">"His explanation seemed adequate. As an anthropologist he was interested in every aspect of our culture. Remember, they have plenty of time.

<div class="line_en">"Incidentally," said Rupert, changing the subject abruptly, "if you think this is a big job, you should see the commission Sullivan's got. He's promised to deliver the two biggest creatures of all -- a sperm whale and a giant squid. They'll be shown locked in mortal combat. What a tableau that will make!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“对了，”鲁柏特突然转变了话题，“如果你认为这个标本很了不起，那你该去看看萨利文，他要送两只世界上最大的动物去，一头巨头鲸，一只大鱿鱼，而且还要保持它们殊死搏杀的姿态。天，那会是怎样的场面！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For a moment Jan did not answer. The idea that had exploded in his mind was too outrageous, too fantastic to be taken seriously. Yet, because of its very daring, it might succeed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="扬好一阵没有说话，脑海中一个新的念头炸开了——这个念头太荒唐，太离谱，简直不敢去认真考虑，但正因为它异想天开，才有可能成功。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That might be the answer, but Jan was not convinced. Sometimes he had thought of confiding his secret to Rupert but his natural caution had held him back. When he met his Overlord friend again, Rupert would probably give something away -- the temptation would be far too great.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="也许是吧，扬并不完全信服，他想把自己的想法告诉鲁柏特，但他天生谨慎，最终还是没有说。鲁柏特太爱出风头，下次见到那个外星人朋友时，说不定把什么都说出去了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It might have been the cabin of a spaceship, but it was not. The walls were covered with meters and instruments: there were no windows -- merely a large screen in front of the pilot. The vessel could carry six passengers, but at the moment Jan was the only one. He was watching the screen intently, absorbing each glimpse of this strange and unknown region as it passed before his eyes. Unknown -- yes, as unknown as anything he might meet beyond the stars, if his mad plan succeeded. He was going into a realm of nightmare creatures, preying upon each other in a darkness undisturbed since the world began. It was a realm above which men had sailed for thousands of years: it lay no more than a kilometre below the keels of their ships -- yet until the last hundred years they had known less about it than the visible face of the moon.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这艘潜艇以前一定是飞船的船舱，舱壁上密密麻麻地安装着各类仪表仪器，没有任何窗户，只是驾驶员面前有一方大显示屏。整个舱里可以装六名乘客，但现在只有扬一个人。扬专心地看着屏幕，仔细观察着眼前飞逝而过的陌生世界。陌生，如果自己那个疯狂计划能够成功，在太空中飞行时看到的一切也是同样陌生。现在自己正在进入一个生长着各种奇特生物的王国，那些貌似恐怖的生物自从开天辟地以来就一直生活在这个漆黑的世界，相互猎食，不受外界的干扰。这个王国上方不到一千米的地方就是海面，人类的船只已经在那里航行了好几千年，但就在几百年前，人类对这个王国的了解并不比对月球了解得多。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The pilot was dropping down from the ocean heights, towards the still unexplored vastness of the South Pacific Basin. He was following, Jan knew, the invisible grid of sound waves created by beacons along the ocean floor. They were still sailing as far above that floor as clouds above the surface of the Earth… There was very little to see: the submarine's scanners were searching the waters in vain. The disturbance created by their jets had probably scared away the smaller fish: if any creature came to investigate, it would be something so large that it did not know the meaning of fear.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="潜艇顺着海底山脉下行，朝着广阔的南太平洋海底盆地驶去，那儿迄今还没有开发过。潜艇跟着海底陆地上的声波定位器发出的声波信号前进，但他们距离海底陆地非常遥远。扫描器什么也没发现，屏幕上依然一片空白。也许是潜艇前进时产生的气流把小鱼全吓跑了，那些胆敢来看个究竟的必定是无所畏惧的庞然大物。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It took only a moment to check their position on the sonar grid. When he had finished with his instrument readings, the pilot remarked: "Before we start the motors again, let's see if we can hear anything."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不一会儿工夫，他们就找到了潜艇在声波网上的位置。一切检查完毕，驾驶员说：“趁还没有启动潜艇，我们看能不能听到什么声音？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Time to get a fix," said the pilot. He threw a set of switches, and the submarine came to rest in a gentle surge of deceleration as the jets ceased their thrust. The vessel was motionless, floating in equilibrium as a balloon floats in the atmosphere.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“该停下来测测方位了。”驾驶员一边说一边拉上了闸。发电机停止了，潜艇慢慢减速，终于停下来了，静静地漂浮在水中，就像空中的气球一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The loudspeaker flooded the quiet little room with a low, continuous murmur of sound. There was no outstanding noise that Jan could distinguish from the rest. It was a steady background, into which all individual sounds had been blended. He was listening, Jan knew, to the myriad creatures of the sea talking together. It was as if he stood in the centre of a forest that teemed with life -- except that there he would have recognized some of the individual voices. Here, not one thread in the tapestry of sound could be disentangled and identified. It was so alien, so remote from anything he had ever known, that it set Jan's scalp crawling. And yet this was part of his own world. The shriek cut across the vibrating background like a flash of lightning against a dark storm cloud. It faded swiftly away Into a banshee wail, an ululation that dwindled and died, yet was repeated a moment later from a more distant source. Then a chorus of screams broke out, a pandemonium that caused the pilot to reach swiftly for the volume control.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="扩音器里立即传来低低的、持续不断的杂音，无法分辨出其中任何一种声音来。那一定是奇怪的海底生物在交谈，这种感觉有点像身处一片生气盎然的大森林，只是在森林里，人们还能分辨出某些动物的独特声音，可这里什么声音也分辨不出来。太奇怪了，它不同于自己知道的任何声音，扬感到头皮发麻，这也是我们世界的一部分呀…杂声中突然响起一声尖啸，犹如乌云中划过一道闪电。很快，尖啸变成了女妖的哀号，慢慢消失了。片刻工夫又一声尖啸骤起，紧接着尖啸声响成一片，驾驶员赶快伸手调节音量。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The tiny cabin vibrated with power -- the power which could hold at bay the immense weight of the waters above their heads, and could create this little bubble of light and air within which men could live. If that power failed, thought Jan, they would become prisoners in a metal tomb, buried deep in the silt of the ocean bed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="潜艇在动力作用下震颤着，正因为有了这种动力，船舱才能承受巨大的水压，成为一个有灯有空气、能供人居住的地方。如果动力没有了，船舱就成了他们的金属坟墓，永远埋在海底淤泥里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“什么声音？”扬问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Weird, isn't it? It's a school of whales, about ten kilometres away. I knew they were in the neighbourhood and thought you'd like to hear them."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“很恐怖吧？那是一群鲸，离这儿还有十公里呢。我知道它们在附近，以为你想听听这样的声音。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我以为海里很安静。那些鲸为什么那样叫？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A fish with incredibly exaggerated jaws was visible in the viewing screen. It appeared to be quite large, but as Jan did now know the scale of the picture it was bard to judge. Hanging from a point just below its gills was a long tendril, ending In an unidentifiable, bell-shaped organ.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="屏幕上出现了一条鱼，一张嘴大得可怕，因为不知道图像的显示比例，实际上应该说是看上去很大。鱼鳃下方垂挂着一根长长的卷须，卷须的尽头状如铃铛，不知有什么用。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"We're seeing it on infrared," said the pilot. "Let's look at the normal picture."</div>

<div class="line_en">The fish vanished completely. Only the pendant remained, glowing with its own phosphorescence. Then, just for an instant, the shape of the creature flickered into visibility as a line of lights flashed out along its body.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="潜艇又往前行驶了，船舱震动起来，那条鱼倏地全身透亮，像一颗流星在黑暗中逃得无影无踪。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's an angler: that's the bait it uses to lure other fish. Fantastic, Isn't it? What I don't understand is -- why doesn't his bait attract fish big enough to eat him? But we can't wait here all day. Watch him run when I switch on the jets."</div>

<div class="line_en">It was after another twenty minutes of slow descent that the Invisible fingers of the scanner beams caught the first glimpse of the ocean bed. Far beneath, a range of low hills was passing, their outlines curiously soft and rounded. Whatever irregularities they might once have possessed had long ago been obliterated by the ceaseless rain from the watery heights above. Even here in mid-Pacific, far from the great estuaries that slowly swept the continents out to sea, that rain never ceased. It came from the storm-scarred flanks of the Andes, from the bodies of a billion living creatures, from the dust of meteors that had wandered through space for ages and had come at last to rest. Here in the eternal night, it was laying the foundations of the lands to be.</div>

<div class="line_en">The submarine continued on its gentle downward glide. Now another picture was beginning to form on the screen: because of the angle of view, it was some tune before Jan could interpret what he saw. Then he realized that they were approaching a submerged mountain, jutting up from the hidden plain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="潜艇继续下行，屏幕上出现了一幅新的画面，由于视角的原因，扬最初没有看出是什么，后来才看清那是座大山矗立在看不见的海底平原边上，他们正朝那儿驶去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The picture was clearer now: at this short range the definition of the scanners improved and the view was almost as distinct as if the image was being formed by light-waves. Jan could see fine detail, could watch the strange fish that pursued each other among the rocks. Once a venomous-looking creature with gaping jaws swam slowly across a half-concealed cleft. So swiftly that the eye could not follow the movement, a long tentacle flashed out and dragged the struggling fish down to its doom.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="距离越来越近，扫描器的效果也越来越好，图像清晰得像阳光下亲眼所见，很多细微的地方都看得清清楚楚，甚至还能看到一些大鱼在石头缝里追逐嬉戏。一只长相狰狞的怪物，嘴张得大大的，在一条半隐半现的裂缝里悠然地游着，一支长长的触须却以迅雷不及掩耳之势卷住一条鱼，那鱼拼命挣扎，但已是厄运难逃。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"What's that?" gasped Jan suddenly. He pointed a shaky finger towards the nearest sphere. The curious pattern of lines on its surface had resolved itself into a network of giant tentacles. As the submarine came closer, he could see that they ended in a great, pulpy bag, from which peered a pair of enormous eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那是什么？”扬失声问道，指着最近那个圆球的手竟有些战抖。圆球表面那些奇特的花纹原来不是图案，而是许多巨大的触角。潜艇靠得更近了，一只柔软的大口袋挡住了去路，里面一双大眼睛瞪着他们。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They were travelling slowly above a spur of rock jutting out from the base of the mountain. The plain beneath was now coming into view: Jan guessed that they were not more than a few hundred metres above the sea-bed. Then he saw, a kilometre or so ahead, a cluster of spheres standing on tripod legs, and joined together by connecting tubes. It looked exactly like the tanks of some chemical plant, and indeed was designed on the same basic principles. The only difference was that here the pressures which had to be resisted were outside, not within.</div>

He was peeping through a microscope into what looked like a small bomb. Presumably it was a pressure-capsule containing some specimen of deep-sea life, still swimming happily around under its normal tons-to-the-square-centimetre conditions.</div>

<div class="line_en">The curving metal walls began to fill the screen. Jan caught a last glimpse of a giant, sucker-studded arm whipping away at their approach. Then there was a dull clang, and a series of scratching noises as the clamps sought for their locking points on the submarine's smooth, oval hull. In a few minutes the vessel was pressed tightly against the wall of the base, the two entrance ports had locked together, and were moving forward through the hull of the submarine at the end of a giant hollow screw. Then came the "pressure equalized" signal, the batches unsealed, and the way into Deep Sea Lab One was open.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“鲁柏特他很好。”扬回答说，“他让我转达他对你的问候，说如果不是害怕得幽闭症，他很乐意来拜访你。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well," said Sullivan, dragging himself away from the eyepiece. "How's Rupert? And what can we do for you?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好吧，”萨利文抬起头说，“鲁柏特怎么样？有什么事要我帮忙？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No more than being in a stratoliner. If anything went wrong, the result would be the same in either case."</div>

<div class="line_en">"That's the sensible approach, but it's surprising how few people see it that way." Sullivan toyed with the controls of his microscope, then shot Jan an inquisitive glance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“有道理。为什么能这样想的人那么少呢？”萨利文继续摆弄着显微镜，只是疑惑地望了扬一眼。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'll be very glad to show you around," he said, "but I must confess I was a little surprised when Rupert passed on your request. I couldn't understand why one of you spacehounds should be interested in our work. Aren't you going in the wrong direction?" He gave a chuckle of amusement. "Personally, I've never seen why you were in such a hurry to get out there. It will be centuries before we've got everything in the oceans nicely charted and pigeonholed."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我很愿意带你参观我的实验室，”他说，“但是，不瞒你说，鲁柏特跟我说你要来，我有点吃惊。为什么一个研究天文的人会对我们的工作感兴趣？找错方向了吧？”他笑了起来，“你为什么要这样着急放弃天文学呢？要了解各种海底生物，并把它们进行分类，还需要好几个世纪呢。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Then he'd certainly feel a little unhappy down here, with five kilometres of water on top of him. Doesn't it worry you, by the way?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Jan took a deep breath. He was glad that Sullivan had broached the subject himself; for it made his task that much easier. Despite the ichthyologist's jest, they had a great deal in common. It should not be too hard to build a bridge, to enlist Sullivan's sympathy and aid. He was a man of imagination, or he would never have invaded this underwater world. But Jan would have to be cautious, for the request he was going to make was, to say the least of it, somewhat unconventional.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="见萨利文提到了正题，扬深吸了一口气，这样事情办起来就容易多了。尽管这个鱼类学家在拿自己开玩笑，两人毕竟有很多共同之处，要相互沟通，得到他的理解和支持应该不难。他的想象力一定很丰富，不然他就不会来闯荡这个水下世界了，但自己也得当心，自己的要求不管怎么说，也太不寻常了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Exceedingly annoyed, no doubt."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“当然怒不可遏。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm sure you would. And suppose, one day, you had a chance of achieving your goal, without them knowing, what would you do? Would you take the opportunity?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我知道你会的。如果有一天，你有机会悄悄实现自己的目标而不让他们知道，你会怎样做？你会抓住这个机会吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was one fact that gave him confidence. Even if Sullivan refused to co-operate, he would certainly keep Jan's secret. And here in this quiet little office on the bed of the Pacific, there seemed no danger that the Overlords -- whatever strange powers they possessed -- would be able to listen to their conversation.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="扬敢于向萨利文提出自己的要求，是因为他知道就算萨利文拒绝和自己合作，也同样会保守秘密，对此他有足够的信心。而且，在这个深藏于海底的办公室里，不管外星人有何等本事，也不可能听到他们的谈话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Professor Sullivan," he began, "if you were interested in the ocean, but the Overlords refused to let you go near it, how would you feel?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“萨利文教授，”扬开始讲了，“你对海洋研究很感兴趣，如果外星人不让你做，你会是怎样一种感受？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Of course. And argue later." Right into my hands thought Jan. He can't retreat now -- unless he's afraid of the Overlords. And I doubt if Sullivan is afraid of anything. He leaned forward across the cluttered table and prepared to present his case.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“先做再说。”正合我意！不能再退缩了，除非自己真的怕了那些外星人，有什么东西能让萨利文害怕吗？扬坐到乱七八糟的桌子边，身子前倾着，准备慷慨陈词。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Professor Sullivan was no fool. Before Jan could speak, his lips twisted into a sardonic smile. "So that's the game, is it?" he said slowly. "Very, very Interesting! Now you go right ahead and tell me why I should help you."</div>
