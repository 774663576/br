<div class="line_en">"Do you feel so sorry for a little donkey that has cost you nothing?" said the Farmer. "What should I do -- I, who have paid my good money for him?"</div>

<div class="line_en">In the evening the Marionette studied by lamplight. With some of the money he had earned, he bought himself a secondhand volume that had a few pages missing, and with that he learned to read in a very short time. As far as writing was concerned, he used a long stick at one end of which he had whittled a long, fine point. Ink he had none, so he used the juice of blackberries or cherries. Little by little his diligence was rewarded. He succeeded, not only in his studies, but also in his work, and a day came when he put enough money together to keep his old father comfortable and happy. Besides this, he was able to save the great amount of fifty pennies. With it he wanted to buy himself a new suit.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="晚上他读书写字。他花了几个子儿，在邻村买了一本大书，封面和目录都没有了，他就读这一本书，他写字用临时削的干树枝代替笔。因为没有墨水，就用干树枝蘸一小瓶桑子汁和樱桃汁。他这样有志于学习、干活和上进，不但使他体弱的父亲十分高兴，而且给自己攒起了四十个子儿买新上衣。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Marionette, ashamed and hurt by those words, did not answer, but taking his glass of milk returned to his father.</div>

<div class="line_en">From that day on, for more than five months, Pinocchio got up every morning just as dawn was breaking and went to the farm to draw water. And every day he was given a glass of warm milk for his poor old father, who grew stronger and better day by day. But he was not satisfied with this. He learned to make baskets of reeds and sold them. With the money he received, he and his father were able to keep from starving.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从这天起，整整五个月工夫，他每天天没亮就起来，跑去摇辘轳，换来一杯牛奶。牛奶使他爸爸虚弱的身体好起来了。可他对这还不满意，因此他又学会了编草篮编草筐，把挣来的钱花得很俭省。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Among other things, he built a rolling chair, strong and comfortable, to take his old father out for an airing on bright, sunny days.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="梦做到这里完了，皮诺乔醒来，睁大了眼睛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">What was his surprise and his joy when, on looking himself over, he saw that he was no longer a Marionette, but that he had become a real live boy! He looked all about him and instead of the usual walls of straw, he found himself in a beautifully furnished little room, the prettiest he had ever seen. In a twinkling, he jumped down from his bed to look on the chair standing near. There, he found a new suit, a new hat, and a pair of shoes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在各位想象一下，他这时候是多么地惊奇，因为他醒来一看，他已经不是一个木偶，却变成一个孩子，跟所有的孩子一模一样！他向四周一看，看到的已经不是原来那座小房子的干草墙壁，而是一个漂亮的小房间，装饰摆设得十分优雅。他连忙跳下床，看见已经放着一套漂亮的新衣服、一顶新帽子和一双皮靴子，对他再合适也没有了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As soon as he was dressed, he put his hands in his pockets and pulled out a little leather purse on which were written the following words: « The Fairy with Azure Hair returns fifty pennies to her dear Pinocchio with many thanks for his kind heart ». The Marionette opened the purse to find the money, and behold -- there were fifty gold coins!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他一穿上衣服，手自然而然地插进口袋，却掏出了一个小小的象牙钱包。钱包上写着这么一句话：“天蓝色头发的仙女还给她亲爱的皮诺乔四十个铜币，并多谢他的好心。”他打开钱包一看，里面可不是四十个铜币，而是四十个金币，崭新的四十个金币，一闪一闪地发着亮光。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After that he went to bed and fell asleep. As he slept, he dreamed of his Fairy, beautiful, smiling, and happy, who kissed him and said to him, "Bravo, Pinocchio! In reward for your kind heart, I forgive you for all your old mischief. Boys who love and take good care of their parents when they are old and sick, deserve praise even though they may not be held up as models of obedience and good behavior. Keep on doing so well, and you will be happy."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他一上床就睡着，他睡着了好像梦见仙女。她是那么漂亮，微微笑着，吻了吻他，对他说：“好样儿，皮诺乔！为了报答你的好心，我原谅了你到今天为止所做的一切淘气事。孩子充满爱心帮助遭到不幸的生病父母，都应当受到称赞，得到疼爱，哪怕他们不能成为听话和品行优良的模范孩子，以后一直这样小心谨慎地做人吧，你会幸福的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"And where is Father?" he cried suddenly. He ran into the next room, and there stood Geppetto, grown years younger overnight, spick and span in his new clothes and gay as a lark in the morning. He was once more Mastro Geppetto, the wood carver, hard at work on a lovely picture frame, decorating it with flowers and leaves, and heads of animals.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我的爸爸呢？”他忽然叫起来。他走进旁边一间房间，看见老杰佩托身体健康，精神抖擞，兴高采烈，跟早先一样，他又干起了他的雕刻老行当，正在精细地设计一个极其漂亮的画框，上面都是叶子、花朵和各种动物的头，">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Surrounded by so much splendor, the Marionette hardly knew what he was doing. He rubbed his eyes two or three times, wondering if he were still asleep or awake and decided he must be awake.</div>
