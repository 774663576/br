<div class="line_en">Parwana wants to howl but she forces herself into a weak smile. It takes strenuous effort at times like this to remember, to not lose sight of, one unshakable truth: This is her own handiwork, this mess. Nothing that has befallen her is unjust or undue. This is what she deserves. She sighs, surveying the soiled linens, dreading the work that awaits her. "I'll get you cleaned up," she says.</div>

<div class="line_en">Parwana smells it before she pulls back the quilt and sees it. It has smeared all over Masooma's buttocks, down her thighs, against the sheets and the mattress and the quilt too. Masooma looks up at her over her shoulder with a timid plea for forgiveness, and shame -- still the shame after all this time, all these years.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="帕尔瓦娜还没掀开被子看，就闻到那味儿了。马苏玛屁股上蹭得到处都是，一直到大腿。床单、床垫和被子上也有。马苏玛回过头，抬脸看着她，怯怯地，带着请求原谅的表情，还有羞耻——这些年来始终不变的羞耻。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Outside, in the early-morning chill, Parwana starts a fire in the cooking pit. When the flames take hold, she fills a pail with water from Shadbagh's communal well and sets it to heat. She holds her palms to the fire. She can see the windmill from here, and the village mosque where Mullah Shekib had taught her and Masooma to read when they were little, and Mullah Shekib's house too, set at the foot at a mild slope. Later, when the sun is up, its roof will be a perfect, strikingly red square against the dust because of the tomatoes his wife has set out to dry in the sun. Parwana gazes up at the morning stars, fading, pale, blinking at her indifferently. She gathers herself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="清晨凛冽，帕尔瓦娜来到屋外，在烧饭的泥坑里生火。等火上来了，她便提着桶去沙德巴格的公共井里打水，再回来烧水。她在火前攥紧两手。从这儿，她能看到村里的磨坊，小时候谢基卜毛拉教她和马苏玛识字的清真寺，还有毛拉建在缓坡底下的家。再过一会儿，等太阳升起，毛拉家的房顶就会在周围的土色之中，变成鲜红夺目的方块，因为他妻子在屋顶晾了西红柿。帕尔瓦娜抬头仰望，晨星暗淡，漠然地对她半睁着眼睛。她费劲地站起身。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">From there, Parwana's day unfolds as it always does, as it has for the four years since their parents' deaths. She feeds the chickens. She chops wood and lugs buckets back and forth from the well. She makes dough and bakes the bread in the tandoor outside their mud house. She sweeps the floor. In the afternoon, she squats by the stream, alongside other village women, washing laundry against the rocks. Afterward, because it is a Friday, she visits her parents' graves in the cemetery and says a brief prayer for each. And all day, in between these chores, she makes time to move Masooma, from side to side, tucking a pillow under one buttock, then the other.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="帕尔瓦娜的一天就此开始，一如往常，一如父母过世这四年来的每一天。她喂鸡，劈柴，一趟趟、一桶桶地从井里提水。她和面，揉面，在土坯房外的泥炉里烤馕，然后擦地板。到了下午，她蹲在小河边，和村里的女人们一起，在石头上洗衣服。接下来，因为今天是礼拜五，她要去坟地，给父母上坟，挨个做一遍简短的告拜。整整一天下来，在这些家务的间隙，她还得抽空儿帮马苏玛翻身，侧过来，再侧过去，把枕头塞到这边的屁股下，过一会儿再换另一边。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She finds him squatting outside his small mud house, fanning a fire in the cooking pit, eyes squeezed against the smoke, with his boy, Abdullah, beside him. She finds him later, talking to other men, men who, like Saboor, have families of their own now but were once the village boys with whom Saboor feuded, flew kites, chased dogs, played hide-and-seek. There is a weight over Saboor these days, a pall of tragedy, a dead wife and two motherless children, one an infant. He speaks now in a tired, barely audible voice. He lumbers around the village a worn, shrunken version of himself.</div>

<div class="line_en">They chat idly for a while in hushed voices of small, inconsequential things, one's breath warming the other's face. These are relatively happy minutes for Parwana. They remind her of when they were little girls, curled up nose to nose beneath the blanket, whispering secrets and gossip, giggling soundlessly. Soon, Masooma is asleep, her tongue rolling noisily around some dream, and Parwana is staring out the window at a sky burnt black. Her mind bounces from one fragmented thought to another and eventually swims to a picture she saw in an old magazine once of a pair of grim-faced brothers from Siam joined at the torso by a thick band of flesh. Two creatures inextricably bound, blood formed in the marrow of one running in the veins of the other, their union permanent. Parwana feels a constriction, despair, like a hand tightening inside her chest. She takes a breath. She tries to direct her thoughts to Saboor once more and instead finds her mind drifting to the rumor she has heard around the village: that he is looking for a new wife. She forces his face from her head. She nips the foolish thought.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她俩轻言细语地瞎聊了一会儿，都是些琐碎的、无关紧要的事，暖暖的呼吸温暖着对方的脸。对帕尔瓦娜来说，这是相对快乐的时刻，常常让她想起她俩还是小女孩儿的时候，也曾这样脸贴着脸，蜷缩在被窝里，低声私语，说着闲话，不出声地吃吃傻笑。没过多久，马苏玛便睡着了。她在做梦，出声地嘟囔着什么。帕尔瓦娜盯着窗外黑漆漆的天空，思绪凌乱，东想一点，西想一点，终于滑落到她在一本旧杂志上见过的照片，一对面无表情的连体暹罗兄弟，共用肥厚的躯干。他们一体相连，无法分离，一个人骨髓里造出来的血，在另一个人的血管里奔流，他们的结合是永久的。帕尔瓦娜感到压抑，绝望，好像有只手死死攥住了她的心。她吸了口气，努力将心思转回到萨布尔身上，却发现思绪飘飘荡荡，坠入了她在村里听到的传言：他在找新老婆。她使劲不去想他的脸。她掐断了自己的愚念。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Masooma was already out, wriggling quietly in the midwife's arms, when their mother cried out and the crown of another head parted her a second time. Masooma's arrival was uneventful. She delivered herself, the angel, the midwife would say later. Parwana's birth was prolonged, agonizing for the mother, treacherous for the baby. The midwife had to free her from the cord that had wrapped itself around Parwana's neck, as if in a murderous fit of separation anxiety. In her worst moments, when she cannot help being swallowed up by a torrent of self-loathing, Parwana thinks that perhaps the cord knew best. Maybe it knew which was the better half.</div>

<div class="line_en">Parwana was a tyrant. She exerted upon their mother the full force of her authority. Their father, bewildered by the infant's histrionics, took the babies' older brother, Nabi, and escaped to sleep at his own brother's house. Nighttime was a misery of epic proportion for the girls' mother, punctuated by only a few moments of fitful rest. She bounced Parwana and walked her all night every night. She rocked her and sang to her. She winced as Parwana ripped into her chafed, swollen breast and gummed her nipple as though she was after the milk in her very bones. But nursing was no antidote: Even with a full belly, Parwana was flailing and shrieking, immune to her mother's supplications.</div>

Women worked with fevered focus to pile onto platters pyramids of fluffy white rice speckled with bits of saffron. They cut bread, scraped crusty rice from the bottom of pots, passed around dishes of fried eggplant topped with yogurt and dried mint. Nabi was out playing with some boys.

They marveled at her easy, sociable demeanor.

<div class="line_en">When the girls were nine years old, the family gathered at Saboor's family home for an early-evening iftar to break the fast after Ramadan. The adults sat on cushions around the perimeter of the room, and the chatter was noisy. Tea, good wishes, and gossip were passed around in equal measure. Old men fingered their prayer beads. Parwana sat quietly, happy to be breathing the same air as Saboor, to be in the vicinity of his owlish dark eyes. In the course of the evening, she chanced glances his way. She caught him in the midst of biting into a sugar cube, or rubbing the smooth slope of his forehead, or laughing spiritedly at something an elderly uncle had said. And if he caught her looking at him, as he did once or twice, she quickly looked away, rigid with embarrassment. Her knees began to shake. Her mouth went so dry she could hardly speak.</div>

As Masooma performed, Parwana watched quietly as though slightly bewildered, the one member of an otherwise adoring audience who didn't understand what all the fuss was about. Every now and then, her mother looked down at her, and reached to squeeze her tiny foot softly, almost apologetically.

And about six months earlier, Parwana had overheard Saboor telling Nabi that one day he hoped to write his stories down. It was shortly after that that Parwana, with her mother, had found herself at a bazaar in another town, and there, at a stall that sold used books, she had spotted a beautiful notebook with crisp lined pages and a thick dark brown leather binding embossed along the edges. Holding it in her hand, she knew her mother couldn't afford to buy it for her. So Parwana had picked a moment when the shopkeeper was not looking and quickly slipped the notebook under her sweater.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此时，帕尔瓦娜想起了那个笔记本，它就藏在家里，压在她一堆东西下。萨布尔老有故事讲，讲精灵，讲仙女，讲妖怪和魔王。村里的小孩经常围着他，屏息凝神，听他给大伙编故事。大概半年前，帕尔瓦娜听到萨布尔告诉纳比，他希望有朝一日自己也能写小说。此前不久，帕尔瓦娜和母亲去了一趟邻镇的巴扎，在一个卖旧书的摊子上，她相中了一个漂亮的笔记本，干干净净的纸上印着一道道的横线，本子皮是厚厚的深棕色皮革，四边压花。帕尔瓦娜把笔记本拿在手上，知道妈妈付不起钱，便趁卖货的不注意，飞快地把它塞进了自己的毛衣。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But in the six months that had since passed, Parwana still hadn't found the courage to give the notebook to Saboor. She was terrified that he might laugh or that he would see it for what it was and give it back. Instead, every night she lay in her cot, the notebook secretly clutched in her hands under the blanket, fingertips brushing the engravings on the leather. Tomorrow, she promised herself every night. Tomorrow I will walk up to him with it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是，半年过去了，帕尔瓦娜依然无法鼓起勇气，把笔记本送给萨布尔。她害怕他笑话她，也怕他看明白其中的含意，再把它退还。于是，她只能每天夜里躺在小床上，手偷偷伸在毯子下，抓着那笔记本，用指尖摩挲封皮上的压花。明天。她每晚都暗自发誓。明天我一定要拿上它，去见他。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">By the time she and her sister were eleven, Parwana had developed a precocious understanding of the strange behavior of boys around girls they privately liked. She saw this especially as she and Masooma walked home from school. School was really the back room of the village mosque where, in addition to teaching Koran recitation, Mullah Shekib had taught every child in the village to read and write, to memorize poetry. Shadbagh was fortunate to have such a wise man for a malik, the girls' father told them. On the way home from these lessons, the twins often came across a group of boys sitting on a wall. As the girls passed, the boys sometimes heckled, sometimes threw pebbles. Parwana usually shouted back and answered their pebbles with rocks, while Masooma always pulled her elbow and told her in a sensible voice to walk faster, to not let them anger her. But she misunderstood. Parwana was angry not because they threw pebbles but because they threw them only at Masooma. Parwana knew: They made a show of the ribbing, and the bigger the show, the deeper their desire. She noticed the way their eyes ricocheted off her and trained themselves on Masooma, forlorn with wonder, helpless to pull away. She knew that behind their crass jokes and lascivious grins, they were terrified of Masooma.</div>

At the gardens of Babur, he had lifted Masooma from the front seat of the car and carried her in his arms to the site of the Mughal emperor's tomb. They had prayed there, the three of them, at the Shah Jahan Mosque, and then, at the edge of a blue-tiled pool, they had eaten the meal Nabi had packed for them.

<div class="line_en">Parwana fills the hookah's vase with water. She takes two matchhead-sized portions of opium flakes with a pinch of tobacco and drops the mix into the hookah's bowl. She lights the coal on the metal screen and hands the hookah to her sister. Masooma takes a deep puff from the hose, reclines against the cushions, and asks if she can rest her legs on Parwana's lap. Parwana reaches down and lifts the limp legs to rest across her own.</div>

Parwana listens to the breeze, to the water gurgling in the hookah. She watches the stars and the smoke drifting over her. The silence is pleasant, and neither she nor Masooma feel an urge to fill it with needless words.</div>

While her sister was facing away, searching her pocket, Parwana planted the heels of her hands on the branch, lifted her bottom, and let it drop. The branch shook. Masooma gasped and lost her balance. Her arms flailed wildly. She tipped forward. Parwana watched her own hands move. What they did was not really push, but there was contact between Masooma's back and the pads of Parwana's fingertips and there was a brief moment of subtle shoving. But it lasted barely an instant before Parwana was reaching for her sister, for the hem of her shirt, before Masooma was calling her name in panic and Parwana hers.

<div class="line_en">Parwana slowly rises to her feet. She walks to the mule and tightens the saddle. She grabs the reins to the animal. She suddenly realizes that she may not know how to live without Masooma. She doesn't know if she can.

How will she learn to tread around the edges of the big gaping hole where Masooma had once been?</div>

<div class="line_en">She walks, slicing the dark, as a cool night wind rips across her face. She keeps her head down. She turns around once only, later. Through the moisture in her eyes, the campfire is a distant, dim, tiny blur of yellow. She pictures her twin sister lying by the fire, alone in the dark. Soon, the fire will die, and Masooma will be cold. Her instinct is to go back, to cover her sister with a blanket and slip in next to her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她走入黑暗，如破浪前行，一缕冰冷的夜风吹在脸上，如刀割。她一直低垂着脑袋。后来也只回过一次头。泪眼朦胧，篝火已化作一颗遥远、暗淡、细小的黄斑。她仿佛看见姐姐躺在火边，一个人置身于黑暗。用不了多久，火就会熄灭，马苏玛也将冷去。一种本能叫她往回走，去用毯子盖上姐姐，再钻进去，躺到她身边。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And that is when she hears something. A faraway, muffled sound, like wailing. Parwana stops in her tracks. She tilts her head and hears it again. Her heart begins to ram in her chest. She wonders, with dread, if it's Masooma calling her back, having had a change of heart. Or maybe it is nothing but a jackal or a desert fox howling somewhere in the dark. Parwana can't be sure. She thinks it might be the wind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在此时，她听见了什么。一个遥远而沉闷的声音。帕尔瓦娜停住脚步，侧耳细听。她的心开始狂跳。她害怕起来，不知道是不是马苏玛改了主意，在叫她回去。也许只是胡狼，或是沙漠里的狐狸在黑暗中嗥叫。帕尔瓦娜吃不准。她想，也许是风吧。">查看中文翻译</div>

She knows that if she does, she will weaken. She will lose what resolve she has because she will see an old bicycle speeding down a hill, bouncing on rocks and gravel, the metal pounding both their rears, clouds of dust kicked up with each sudden skid. She sits on the frame, and Masooma is the one on the saddle, she is the one who takes the hairpin turns at full speed, dropping the bike into a deep lean. But Parwana is not afraid. She knows that her sister will not send her flying over the handlebars, that she will not hurt her. The world melts into a whirligig blur of excitement, and the wind whooshes in their ears, and Parwana looks over her shoulder at her sister and her sister looks back, and they laugh together as stray dogs give chase.</div>
