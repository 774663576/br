<div class="line_en">Later that morning, three men -- two lawyers and the judge -- sat in chambers while Lon finished speaking. It was a moment before the judge answered.</div>

<div class="line_en">"No, Your Honor, it can't," Lon answered almost too quickly. Stay relaxed, he told himself. Take a deep breath.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No, Your Honor. It's of a personal nature. I know it's out of the ordinary, but I really need to take care of it." Good, better.</div>

<div class="line_en">"It's an unusual request," he said, pondering the situation. "It seems to me the trial could very well end today. Are you saying this urgent matter can't wait until later this evening or tomorrow?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"And it has nothing to do with this case?"</div>

<div class="line_en">The judge leaned back in his chair, evaluating him for a moment. "Mr. Bates, how do you feel about this?"</div>

<div class="line_en">He cleared his throat. "Mr. Hammond called me this morning and I've already spoken to my clients. They're willing to postpone until Monday."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I believe so," he said. "Mr. Hammond has agreed to reopen discussion on a certain matter not covered by this proceeding."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I see," the judge said. "And do you believe it is in your clients' best interests to do this?"</div>

<div class="line_en">He paused for effect, then looked to some papers on his desk. "I'll agree to adjourn until Monday. Nine o'clock sharp."</div>

<div class="line_en">The judge looked hard at both of them and thought about it.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Thank you, Your Honor," Lon said.</div>

<div class="line_en">Two minutes later he was leaving the courthouse. He walked to the car he had parked directly across the street, got in, and began the drive to New Bern, his hands shaking.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I don't like it," he finally said, "not at all. But Mr. Hammond has never made a similar request before, and I assume the matter is very important to him."</div>
