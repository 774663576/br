<div class="line_en">It was late in the afternoon before I woke, strengthened and refreshed. Sherlock Holmes still sat exactly as I had left him, save that he had laid aside his violin and was deep in a book. He looked across at me as I stirred, and I noticed that his face was dark and troubled.</div>

<div class="line_en">I took our mongrel accordingly and left him, together with a half-sovereign, at the old naturalist's in Pinchin Lane. At Camberwell I found Miss Morstan a little weary after her night's adventures but very eager to hear the news. Mrs. Forrester, too, was full of curiosity. I told them all that we had done, suppressing, however, the more dreadful parts of the tragedy. Thus, although I spoke of Mr. Sholto's death, I said nothing of the exact manner and method of it. With all my omissions, however, there was enough to startle and amaze them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是，我带走了我们这只混血狗，归还给宾奇小街的老自然学者，并给了他半个英镑。到了坎伯威尔，我发现，经历了昨夜的冒险后，摩斯坦小姐有些疲倦，但还是渴望听到新消息。福里斯特夫人也充满了好奇。我向她们述说了我们做的所有事情，但保留了一些凶险的地方没有说。虽然说到了肖尔托先生的被害，可是我并没有提起详细的情况和手段。尽管我省略了不少情节，但还是够让她们一惊又一叹的。">查看中文翻译</div>

And now he has slammed off to his room, but I can hear him walking away the same as ever. I hope he's not going to be ill, sir. I ventured to say something to him about cool medicine, but he turned on me, sir, with such a look that I don't know how ever I got out of the room."</div>

<div class="line_en">"No, I could not sleep," he answered. "This infernal problem is consuming me. It is too much to be balked by so petty an obstacle, when all else had been overcome. I know the men, the launch, everything; and yet I can get no news. I have set other agencies at work and used every means at my disposal.

<div class="line_en">We did not, however. Not a word came to us either from Wiggins or from the other agencies. There were articles in most of the papers upon the Norwood tragedy. They all appeared to be rather hostile to the unfortunate Thaddeus Sholto. No fresh details were to be found, however, in any of them, save that an inquest was to be held upon the following day. I walked over to Camberwell in the evening to report our ill-success to the ladies, and on my return I found Holmes dejected and somewhat morose. He would hardly reply to my questions and busied himself all evening in an obtruse chemical analysis which involved much heating of retorts and distilling of vapours, ending at last in a smell which fairly drove me out of the apartment. Up to the small hours of the morning I could hear the clinking of his test-tubes which told me that he was still engaged in his malodorous experiment.</div>

<div class="line_en">With reference to the Upper Norwood tragedy [it remarked] we have reason to believe that the matter promises to be even more complex and mysterious than was originally supposed. Fresh evidence has shown that it is quite impossible that Mr. Thaddeus Sholto could have been in anyway concerned in the matter. He and the housekeeper, Mrs. Bernstone, were both released yesterday evening. It is believed, however, that the police have a clue as to the real culprits, and that it is being prosecuted by Mr. Athelney Jones, of Scotland Yard, with all his well-known energy and sagacity.

<div class="line_en">It was a long day. Every time that a knock came to the door or a sharp step passed in the street, I imagined that it was either Holmes returning or an answer to his advertisement. I tried to read, but my thoughts would wander off to our strange quest and to the ill-assorted and villainous pair whom we were pursuing. Could there be, I wondered, some radical flaw in my companion's reasoning? Might he not be suffering from some huge self-deception? Was it not possible that his nimble and speculative mind had built up this wild theory upon faulty premises? I had never known him to be wrong, and yet the keenest reasoner may occasionally be deceived. He was likely, I thought, to fall into error through the over-refinement of his logic -- his preference for a subtle and bizarre explanation when a plainer and more commonplace one lay ready to his hand. Yet, on the other hand, I had myself seen the evidence, and I had heard the reasons for his deductions. When I looked back on the long chain of curious circumstances, many of them trivial in themselves but all tending in the same direction, I could not disguise from myself that even if Holmes's explanation were incorrect the true theory must be equally outré and startling.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这一天过得真慢。每次听到敲门的声音，或是街上沉重的脚步声，我都以为是福尔摩斯，或者是看见广告来报信的人。我试着看书，但是思想总是溜到我们这次奇怪的搜索，以及我们所追踪的那对很难凑合到一起的邪恶罪犯上。有时我还这样想：会不会是福尔摩斯的理论有什么基本的错误？他是不是犯了严重的自欺病？有没有可能是他那喜好臆想的敏锐头脑从错误的前提出发，得出了这些疯狂的推理？我从没见过他的工作发生错误，可是，智者千虑，必有一失。我想，有可能因为他的逻辑太过精巧，而他太喜欢给手头上平淡、普通的问题弄出一个极为精妙、奇异的解释，所以才更可能犯下错误。可是，回过头来一想，我亲眼见过那些证据，也亲耳听过他作推断的理由。再看一看这一连串的奇怪事件，其中有许多都无关重要，可是全部都指向了同一方向。我不得不承认，就算福尔摩斯的理解真的错了，那套正确的推理也必定同样异乎寻常、令人惊讶。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This was clearly Holmes's doing. The Baker Street address was enough to prove that. It struck me as rather ingenious because it might beread by the fugitives without their seeing in it more than the natural anxiety of a wife for her missing husband.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个小广告显然是福尔摩斯登的。贝克街的住址就足以证明这一点了。我认为这个广告非常巧妙，因为，即使匪徒们看到了，也看不出什么奥秘，只会认为那是一个妻子担心失踪丈夫的普通广告。">查看中文翻译</div>

So it could not be he who climbed over roofs and through trapdoors. It's a very dark case, and my professional credit is at stake. I should be very glad of a little assistance."</div>

<div class="line_en">A heavy step was heard ascending the stair, with a great wheezing and rattling as from a man who was sorely put to it for breath. Once or twice he stopped, as though the climb were too much for him, but at last he made his way to our door and entered. His appearance corresponded to the sounds which we had heard. He was an aged man, clad in seafaring garb, with an old pea-jacket buttoned up to his throat. His back was bowed, his knees were shaky, and his breathing was painfully asthmatic. As he leaned upon a thick oaken cudgel his shoulders heaved in the effort to draw the air into his lungs. He had a coloured scarf round his chin, and I could see little of his face save a pair of keen dark eyes, overhung by bushy white brows and long gray side-whiskers. Altogether he gave me the impression of a respectable master mariner who had fallen into years and poverty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="传来一阵沉重的上楼的脚步声，还有费劲的喘息声，似乎是一个呼吸困难的人发出来的。他中间稍停了一两次，好像爬楼梯对他来说太费力气了，最后，他终于上来了，走进屋里来。他的容貌和我们所听见的声音正相符。他是一个老人，穿着一身航海服，一件旧粗呢大衣一直扣到颈间。他弯着腰，两腿颤抖，气喘得很痛苦。他手拄一根粗橡木棍，两肩不断耸动着，好像呼吸很吃力。一条彩色围巾围在他的下巴上，在他脸上，我只看得见一双犀利的黑眼睛、上方浓密的白眉毛，以及长长的灰髭须。整体来看，我对他的印象是，他似乎是一个年事已高、贫困潦倒，但仍令人尊敬的航海家。">查看中文翻译</div>
