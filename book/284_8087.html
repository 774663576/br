He says he sees things on rainy days as doesn't show when it's fair weather. He once found a little fox cub half drowned in its hole and he brought it home in th' bosom of his shirt to keep it warm. Its mother had been killed nearby an' th' hole was swum out an' th' rest o' th' litter was dead. He's got it at home now. He found a half-drowned young crow another time an' he brought it home, too, an' tamed it. It's named Soot because it's so black, an' it hops an' flies about with him everywhere."</div>

<div class="line_en">The time had come when Mary had forgotten to resent Martha's familiar talk. She had even begun to find it interesting and to be sorry when she stopped or went away. The stories she had been told by her Ayah when she lived in India had been quite unlike those Martha had to tell about the moorland cottage which held fourteen people who lived in four little rooms and never had quite enough to eat. The children seemed to tumble about and amuse themselves like a litter of rough, good-natured collie puppies. Mary was most attracted by the mother and Dickon. When Martha told stories of what "mother" said or did they always sounded comfortable.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mary did not ask where the library was, because she was suddenly inspired by a new idea. She made up her mind to go and find it herself. She was not troubled about Mrs. Medlock. Mrs. Medlock seemed always to be in her comfortable housekeeper's sitting-room downstairs. In this queer place one scarcely ever saw any one at all. In fact, there was no one to see but the servants, and when their master was away they lived a luxurious life below stairs, where there was a huge kitchen hung about with shining brass and pewter, and a large servants' hall where there were four or five abundant meals eaten every day, and where a great deal of lively romping went on when Mrs. Medlock was out of the way.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛丽没有问书房在哪里，因为一个新点子突然照得她心头一亮。她决定自己去找到书房。莫得劳克太太没给她什么麻烦。莫得劳克太太好像总待在她舒适的起居室里，那是专门在给管家用的，在楼下面。这个古怪的地方经常不见人影。其实，除了仆人就没有别人。他们的主人不在的时候，仆人们在楼下享受着奢侈的生活。楼下有个奇大的厨房，四处挂着锃亮的铜器和锡镴器皿。还有个宽敞的仆人大厅，那里每天要吃四五顿丰盛的饭。没有莫得劳克太太挡道的时候，那里经常有兴高采烈的耍笑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mary's meals were served regularly, and Martha waited on her, but no one troubled themselves about her in the least. Mrs. Medlock came and looked at her every day or two, but no one inquired what she did or told her what to do. She supposed that perhaps this was the English way of treating children. In India she had always been attended by her Ayah, who had followed her about and waited on her, hand and foot. She had often been tired of her company. Now she was followed by nobody and was learning to dress herself because Martha looked as though she thought she was silly and stupid when she wanted to have things handed to her and put on.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛丽的饮食按时供应着，玛莎服侍她，但是没有任何人对她稍有关心。每过一两天，莫得劳克太太来看看她，但是没有人问她做了什么，告诉她要做什么。她猜想这种对待小孩的方式可能是英国式的。在印度，奶妈总是一手一脚地伺候她，随时随地跟着她，等候她的吩咐。她经常被奶妈跟烦了。现在没有人跟着她，她还学着自己穿衣服，因为她想让玛莎把东西递给她、给自己穿上的时候，玛莎像看傻瓜笨蛋似的看着她。一次，玛莎站着等她给自己戴手套。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That's a pity," said Martha. "If Mrs. Medlock'd let thee go into th' library, there's thousands o' books there."</div>

<div class="line_en">Mary had worn her contrary scowl for an hour after that, but it made her think several entirely new things.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="后来玛丽的怒容挂了一个小时，不过这让她思考几样全新的事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She stood at the window for about ten minutes this morning after Martha had swept up the hearth for the last time and gone downstairs. She was thinking over the new idea which had come to her when she heard of the library. She did not care very much about the library itself, because she had read very few books; but to hear of it brought back to her mind the hundred rooms with closed doors. She wondered if they were all really locked and what she would find if she could get into any of them. Were there a hundred really? Why shouldn't she go and see how many doors she could count? It would be something to do on this morning when she could not go out. She had never been taught to ask permission to do things, and she knew nothing at all about authority, so she would not have thought it necessary to ask Mrs. Medlock if she might walk about the house, even if she had seen her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛莎把石楠炉毯扫了最后一遍，下楼去了，玛丽在窗前站了十分钟。她在盘算着那个听到书房时想到的新点子。她不怎么关心书房本身，因为她只读过很少几本书，但是听到书房让她记起那上锁的一百个房间。她好奇地想它们真的都锁上了吗，要是她能进去随便一间，能发现什么呢？真的有一百间吗？她干嘛不自己去数数有多少？今天早晨她不能出去，这样也有点儿事做。没有人教过她做事要得到准许，她根本没有“许可”这个概念，所以她不觉得有必要问莫得劳克太太自己是否可以在房子里到处走，尽管她见到了她。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She opened the door of the room and went into the corridor, and then she began her wanderings. It was a long corridor and it branched into other corridors and it led her up short flights of steps which mounted to others again. There were doors and doors, and there were pictures on the walls. Sometimes they were pictures of dark, curious landscapes, but oftenest they were portraits of men and women in queer, grand costumes made of satin and velvet. She found herself in one long gallery whose walls were covered with these portraits. She had never thought there could be so many in any house. She walked slowly down this place and stared at the faces which also seemed to stare at her. She felt as if they were wondering what a little girl from India was doing in their house. Some were pictures of children -- little girls in thick satin frocks which reached to their feet and stood out about them, and boys with puffed sleeves and lace collars and long hair, or with big ruffs around their necks. She always stopped to look at the children, and wonder what their names were, and where they had gone, and why they wore such odd clothes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她打开房间门走到走廊上，开始她的漫游。走廊很长，分岔与别的走廊相连，一个分岔把她引上一小段上升的台阶，这种台阶一段搭上另一段。一道门又一道门，墙上有一幅幅画。画上有时是阴暗神秘的风景，但最多的是男男女女的肖像，身着缎子和天鹅绒做的古怪华丽的服装。不知不觉她来到一个长长的画廊，墙上挂满了这样的画像。她从没想到这座房子里有这么多画像。她慢慢往下走，盯着那些面孔，那些面孔好像也盯着她。她觉得他们在纳闷：这个印度来的小女孩在他们的房子里做什么。有些画像是儿童的——小女孩穿着厚厚的缎质裙子，宽松的裙子拖到脚边，立在她们周围。男生的袖子膨胀，衣领带蕾丝花边，留着长头发，要不然就脖子上就套着一圈大轮子般的皱领。她总是停下来看那些小孩，猜想他们叫什么名字，都去了哪里，为什么穿着这些古怪的衣服。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was a stiff, plain little girl rather like herself. She wore a green bro-cade dress and held a green parrot on her finger. Her eyes had a sharp, curious look.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有个小女孩，脸紧绷绷的，面目单调，相当像她自己。她穿着一件绿色裙子，锦缎上用金银丝织着浮花，手指头上举着一只鹦鹉。她的眼神敏锐而好奇。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你现在住在哪儿？”玛丽大声对她讲，“我但愿你在这儿。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Surely no other little girl ever spent such a queer morning. It seemed as if there was no one in all the huge rambling house but her own small self, wandering about upstairs and down, through narrow passages and wide ones, where it seemed to her that no one but herself had ever walked. Since so many rooms had been built, people must have lived in them, but it all seemed so empty that she could not quite believe it true.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="其他小女孩肯定没有过这么奇怪的早上。这座巨大的房子四处胡乱蔓延，里面好像空无一人，只有小小的她形只影单，上下乱走，穿过窄的过道、宽的过道。除了她，这些过道似乎从没人走过。既然修了这么多房间，就该一定有人住过，但是看着全都是空的，她不大能相信这是真的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was not until she climbed to the second floor that she thought of turning the handle of a door. All the doors were shut, as Mrs. Medlock had said they were, but at last she put her hand on the handle of one of them and turned it. She was almost frightened for a moment when she felt that it turned without difficulty and that when she pushed upon the door itself it slowly and heavily opened. It was a massive door and opened into a big bedroom. There were embroidered hangings on the wall, and inlaid furniture such as she had seen in India stood about the room. A broad window with leaded panes looked out upon the moor; and over the mantel was another portrait of the stiff, plain little girl who seemed to stare at her more curiously than ever.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="直到她爬上三楼，才想起去扭门把手。所有的门都紧闭着，正如莫得劳克太太说的，但是当她最后把手放到一个把手上转动，把手毫不费力地转起来，她推门，门缓慢而沉重地自己开了，她一时吓住了。门很大很厚，通向一间大卧室。墙上有刺绣的挂饰，房间四处摆着带镶嵌的家具，像她在印度见过的。一扇宽阔的窗户镶着彩色带铅玻璃，面向下面的牧尔；壁炉台上是那个紧绷、单调的小女孩的另一幅画像，小女孩盯着她，眼神比以前更加好奇。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After that she opened more doors and more. She saw so many rooms that she became quite tired and began to think that there must be a hundred, though she had not counted them. In all of them there were old pictures or old tapestries with strange scenes worked on them. There were curious pieces of furniture and curious ornaments in nearly all of them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后她打开了越来越多的门。她看到很多房间，开始觉得有些累，心想这里的房间一定有一百个，尽管她没有数过。所有的房间里都有老画，不然有旧挂毯，上面织着奇怪的场景。几乎所有房间都有精致的家具和精致的装饰。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In one room, which looked like a lady's sitting-room, the hangings were all embroidered velvet, and in a cabinet were about a hundred little elephants made of ivory. They were of different sizes, and some had their mahouts or palanquins on their backs. Some were much bigger than the others and some were so tiny that they seemed only babies. Mary had seen carved ivory in India and she knew all about elephants. She opened the door of the cabinet and stood on a footstool and played with these for quite a long time. When she got tired she set the elephants in order and shut the door of the cabinet.</div>

<div class="line_en">In all her wanderings through the long corridors and the empty rooms, she had seen nothing alive; but in this room she saw something. Just after she had closed the cabinet door she heard a tiny rustling sound. It made her jump and look around at the sofa by the fireplace, from which it seemed to come. In the corner of the sofa there was a cushion, and in the velvet which covered it there was a hole, and out of the hole peeped a tiny head with a pair of frightened eyes in it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她游荡在那些长走廊和空房间的时候，没有看到任何活物，但是在这个房间里她看到了。她刚把壁橱门关上便听到细碎的窸窣声，她跳起来，四处查看火炉附近的沙发，声音似乎是从那里传来的。沙发一角里有个靠枕，天鹅绒面料上有个洞，洞里探出一丁点儿脑袋，带着一双惊恐的眼睛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mary crept softly across the room to look. The bright eyes belonged to a little gray mouse, and the mouse had eaten a hole into the cushion and made a comfortable nest there. Six baby mice were cuddled up asleep near her. If there was no one else alive in the hundred rooms there were seven mice who did not look lonely at all.</div>
