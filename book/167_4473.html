<div class="line_en">When the silence had stretched unbearably long and the men knew at last that the horn would not wind again, they grinned at one another sheepishly, as if to deny that they had been anxious. Jon Snow fed a few sticks to the fire, buckled on his swordbelt, pulled on his boots, shook the dirt and dew from the cloak, and fastened it around his shoulders. The flames blazed up beside him, welcome heat beating against his face as he dressed. He could hear the Lord Commander moving inside the tent. After a moment Mormont lifted the flap. "One blast?" On his shoulder, his raven sat fluffed and silent, looking miserable.</div>

<div class="line_en">The long low note lingered at the edge of hearing. The sentries at the ringwall stood still in their footsteps, breath frosting and heads turned toward the west. As the sound of the horn faded, even the wind ceased to blow. Men rolled from their blankets and reached for spears and swordbelts, moving quietly, listening. A horse whickered and was hushed. For a heartbeat it seemed as if the whole forest were holding its breath. The brothers of the Night's Watch waited for a second blast, praying they should not hear it, fearing that they would.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这绵延低沉的声音停留在听觉边缘。环墙上的哨兵们一动不动地站定，转头向西，呼吸结雾。当号声退去，连狂风也停止了呼啸。人们卷好毯子，拿起枪矛和长剑，沉默地换位，侧耳倾听。一匹马嘶鸣开来，旋即又被安抚。刹那间，似乎整个森林都屏住了呼吸。守夜人军团的弟兄们等待着第二声号角，却又暗自祈祷不要听到，恐惧即将来临的答案。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mormont moved to the fire. "The Halfhand. And past time." He had grown more restive every day they waited; much longer and he would have been fit to whelp cubs. "See that there's hot food for the men and fodder for the horses. I'll see Qhorin at once."</div>

<div class="line_en">"I'll bring him, my lord." The men from the Shadow Tower had been expected days ago. When they had not appeared, the brothers had begun to wonder. Jon had heard gloomy mutterings around the cookfire, and not just from Dolorous Edd. Ser Ottyn Wythers was for retreating to Castle Black as soon as possible. Ser Mallador Locke would strike for the Shadow Tower, hoping to pick up Qhorin's trail and learn what had befallen him. And Thoren Smallwood wanted to push on into the mountains. "Mance Rayder knows he must battle the Watch," Thoren had declared, "but he will never look for us so far north. If we ride up the Milkwater, we can take him unawares and cut his host to ribbons before he knows we are on him."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我马上把他找来，大人。”影子塔的人马早该抵达，却一直不曾现身，兄弟们不禁都起了疑心。平日琼恩在篝火边聚会时听过各种版本的阴郁联想——当然，并不都是忧郁的艾迪的杰作。官员中，奥廷·威勒斯爵士主张尽快撤回黑城堡；马拉多·洛克爵士希望调头向影子塔前进，沿途搜索科林的踪迹，以确定到底发生了什么；而索伦·斯莫伍德打算突入群山。“曼斯·雷德很清楚自己必须与守夜人一战，”索伦宣布，“但他绝不会料到我们会深入极北。如果咱们顺着乳河主动出击，定能出其不意，攻其不备，彻底粉碎他的军队。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They had argued for many hours, and reached no agreement. The Old Bear was too stubborn to retreat, but neither would he rush headlong up the Milkwater, seeking battle. In the end, nothing had been decided but to wait a few more days for the men from the Shadow Tower, and talk again if they did not appear.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们争执多时，却没有达成任何一致。熊老执意不肯撤退，也不愿轻率地踏上乳河的征途，贸然求战。最后，大家只同意再等些时日，看影子塔的队伍能否出现，之后再做商议。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It's only the men from the Shadow Tower." It was growing harder to cling to the hope of Benjen Stark's safe return. The cloak he had found beneath the Fist could well have belonged to his uncle or one of his men, even the Old Bear admitted as much, though why they would have buried it there, wrapped around the cache of dragonglass, no one could say. "Sam, I have to go."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这是影子塔的队伍。”班杨·史塔克归来的希望越来越渺茫。琼恩在拳峰之下找到的那件斗篷很可能属于叔叔或他的手下，这点就连熊老也不否认，不过，对于斗篷为何埋在此地，还裹着龙晶器物，没有人知道。“山姆，我得走了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At the ringwall, he found the guards sliding spikes from the half-frozen earth to make an opening. It was not long until the first of the brothers from the Shadow Tower began wending their way up the slope. All in leather and fur they were, with here and there a bit of steel or bronze; heavy beards covered hard lean faces, and made them look as shaggy as their garrons. Jon was surprised to see some of them were riding two to a horse. When he looked more closely, it was plain that many of them were wounded. There has been trouble on the way.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="环墙边，守卫们正从半冻的土地里拔出尖桩，以清出通道。很快，影子塔来的兄弟们登上了山坡，他们都穿着皮革和毛衣，身上发出钢铁或青铜的反光，粗厚的胡须遮盖了坚毅消瘦的面容，使他们看起来和胯下的马匹一样毛发蓬乱。琼恩惊讶地发现很多马乃是两人共骑。当他们走得更近，他更清楚地看见人群中有不少人负伤。看来他们在路上遇到了麻烦。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jon knew Qhorin Halfhand the instant he saw him, though they had never met. The big ranger was half a legend in the Watch; a man of slow words and swift action, tall and straight as a spear, long-limbed and solemn. Unlike his men, he was clean-shaven. His hair fell from beneath his helm in a heavy braid touched with hoarfrost, and the blacks he wore were so faded they might have been greys. Only thumb and forefinger remained on the hand that held the reins; the other fingers had been sheared off catching a wildling's axe that would otherwise have split his skull. It was told that he had thrust his maimed fist into the face of the axeman so the blood spurted into his eyes, and slew him while he was blind. Since that day, the wildlings beyond the Wall had known no foe more implacable.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽然彼此素未谋面，但他第一眼便认出了断掌科林。这位高大的游骑兵是守夜人军团的传奇人物，他语调缓慢，却行动迅捷，生得像枪矛一样又高又直，四肢硕长，神情肃穆。他的外貌与手下们迥然不同，脸庞修得干干净净，披霜的长发扎成一个大辫子垂下头盔，而身上的黑衣因天长日久已褪成灰色。他握缰的手只有拇指和食指——其余的指头当年为了格挡野人的战斧对头颅的致命一击已然尽数失去。据说挡下那一记之后，他用伤残的拳头痛击挥斧的敌人，鲜血喷进野人的眼睛里，使得对方完全盲目，最后反被科林击毙。从那天起，长城外的野人便把他当做最值得敬畏的对手。">查看中文翻译</div>

He could hear the Old Bear's voice inside the tent, punctuated by the raven's squawks and Qhorin Halfhand's quieter tones, but he could not make out the words. Alfyn Crowkiller dead, that's good.

<div class="line_en">He had made a dagger for Grenn as well, and another for the Lord Commander. The warhorn he had given to Sam. On closer examination the horn had proved cracked, and even after he had cleaned all the dirt out, Jon had been unable to get any sound from it. The rim was chipped as well, but Sam liked old things, even worthless old things. "Make a drinking horn out of it," Jon told him, "and every time you take a drink you'll remember how you ranged beyond the Wall, all the way to the Fist of the First Men." He gave Sam a spearhead and a dozen arrowheads as well, and passed the rest out among his other friends for luck.</div>

<div class="line_en">Jon slid his new dagger from its sheath and studied the flames as they played against the shiny black glass. He had fashioned the wooden hilt himself, and wound hempen twine around it to make a grip. Ugly, but it served. Dolorous Edd opined that glass knives were about as useful as nipples on a knight's breastplate, but Jon was not so certain. The dragonglass blade was sharper than steel, albeit far more brittle.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Old Bear had seemed pleased by the dagger, but he preferred a steel knife at his belt, Jon had noticed. Mormont could offer no answers as to who might have buried the cloak or what it might mean. Perhaps Qhorin will know The Halfhand had ventured deeper into the wild than any other living man.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="熊老似乎挺欣赏这种匕首，但琼恩发现，他挎在腰间的还是钢刀。莫尔蒙也不明白究竟有谁会把斗篷埋在此处，或是其中代表的含义。或许科林知道？断掌在荒野中的经历无人能及。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Qhorin was seated cross-legged on the floor, his spine as straight as a spear. Candlelight flickered against the hard flat planes of his cheeks as he spoke. "… Rattleshirt, the Weeping Man, and every other chief great and small," he was saying. "They have wargs as well, and mammoths, and more strength than we would have dreamed. Or so he claimed. I will not swear as to the truth of it. Ebben believes the man was telling us tales to make his life last a little longer."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes. To be sure." The Old Bear unrolled a map, frowned at it, tossed it aside, opened another. He was pondering where the hammer would fall, Jon could see it. The Watch had once manned seventeen castles along the hundred leagues of the Wall, but they had been abandoned one by one as the brotherhood dwindled. Only three were now garrisoned, a fact that Mance Rayder knew as well as they did. "Ser Alliser Thorne will bring back fresh levies from King's Landing, we can hope. If we man Greyguard from the Shadow Tower and the Long Barrow from Eastwatch…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，说得没错。”熊老展开一张地图，皱眉参看，旋即扔到一边，又展开另一张。他正在估量野人们可能突击的地点，琼恩看得出来。绝境长城沿线上百里格，守夜人军团曾经据有十九座城堡，但随着人数凋零，这些堡垒一个接一个被放弃。到如今，只有三座城仍有守卫，而曼斯·雷德和他们一样对这情况了然于胸。“我们可以指望艾里莎·索恩爵士从君临带点新手回来。眼下咱们不妨从影子塔派人防守灰卫堡，从东海望调人进驻长车楼…”">查看中文翻译</div>

Their young as well, and beasts… have you ever seen a goat climb a ladder? A rope? They will need to build a stair, or a great ramp… it will take a moon's turn at the least, perhaps longer.
