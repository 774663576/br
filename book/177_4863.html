<div class="line_en">One morning the postman came just as he was washing in the scullery. Suddenly he heard a wild noise from his mother. Rushing into the kitchen, he found her standing on the hearthrug wildly waving a letter and crying "Hurrah!" as if she had gone mad. He was shocked and frightened.</div>

<div class="line_en">He went out to dinner several times in his evening suit that had been William's. Each time his mother's heart was firm with pride and joy. He was started now.

<div class="line_en">But she began to spare her hands. They, too, were work-gnarled now. The skin was shiny with so much hot water, the knuckles rather swollen. But she began to be careful to keep them out of soda. She regretted what they had been -- so small and exquisite. And when Annie insisted on her having more stylish blouses to suit her age, she submitted. She even went so far as to allow a black velvet bow to be placed on her hair. Then she sniffed in her sarcastic manner, and was sure she looked a sight. But she looked a lady, Paul declared, as much as Mrs. Major Moreton, and far, far nicer. The family was coming on. Only Morel remained unchanged, or rather, lapsed slowly.</div>

The front door went up a step from off this rough pavement, where the feet of the passersby rasped and clattered. The brown paint on the door was so old that the naked wood showed between the rents.

<div class="line_en">Clara suffered badly from her mother. Paul felt as if his eyes were coming very wide open. Wasn't he to take Clara's fulminations so seriously, after all? She spun steadily at her work. He experienced a thrill of joy, thinking she might need his help. She seemed denied and deprived of so much. And her arm moved mechanically, that should never have been subdued to a mechanism, and her head was bowed to the lace, that never should have been bowed. She seemed to be stranded there among the refuse that life has thrown away, doing her jennying. It was a bitter thing to her to be put aside by life, as if it had no use for her.

And then sometimes he caught her looking at him from under her brows with an almost furtive, sullen scrutiny, which made him move quickly. Often she met his eyes. But then her own were, as it were, covered over, revealing nothing. She gave him a little, lenient smile.

There was scarcely time to go inside the squat, square building that crowns the bluff of rock. They leaned upon the wall where the cliff runs sheer down to the Park. Below them, in their holes in the sandstone, pigeons preened themselves and cooed softly. Away down upon the boulevard at the foot of the rock, tiny trees stood in their own pools of shadow, and tiny people went scurrying about in almost ludicrous importance.</div>

The steep scarp cliffs across the river looked puny. Great stretches of country darkened with trees and faintly brightened with corn-land, spread towards the haze, where the hills rose blue beyond grey.</div>

<div class="line_en">Their two hands lay on the rough stone parapet of the Castle wall. He had inherited from his mother a fineness of mould, so that his hands were small and vigorous. Hers were large, to match her large limbs, but white and powerful looking. As Paul looked at them he knew her. "She is wanting somebody to take her hands -- for all she is so contemptuous of us," he said to himself. And she saw nothing but his two hands, so warm and alive, which seemed to live for her. He was brooding now, staring out over the country from under sullen brows. The little, interesting diversity of shapes had vanished from the scene; all that remained was a vast, dark matrix of sorrow and tragedy, the same in all the houses and the river-flats and the people and the birds; they were only shapen differently. And now that the forms seemed to have melted away, there remained the mass from which all the landscape was composed, a dark mass of struggle and pain. The factory, the girls, his mother, the large, uplifted church, the thicket of the town, merged into one atmosphere -- dark, brooding, and sorrowful, every bit.</div>

Sex desire was a sort of detached thing, that did not belong to a woman. He loved Miriam with his soul. He grew warm at the thought of Clara, he battled with her, he knew the curves of her breast and shoulders as if they had been moulded inside him; and yet he did not positively desire her. He would have denied it for ever. He believed himself really bound to Miriam. If ever he should marry, some time in the far future, it would be his duty to marry Miriam. That he gave Clara to understand, and she said nothing, but left him to his courses. He came to her, Mrs. Dawes, whenever he could. Then he wrote frequently to Miriam, and visited the girl occasionally. So he went on through the winter; but he seemed not so fretted. His mother was easier about him. She thought he was getting away from Miriam.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他与许多同龄的青年一样，性的问题在他心中显得很复杂，以至于他拒绝承认自己曾想过要克莱拉或米丽亚姆，或任何一个相识的女人。性欲是一种超然的东西，它并不属于一个女人。他精神上爱着米丽亚姆，而一想到克莱拉他就感到温暖。在心里穹她争斗，他对她的乳房及肩膀的线条非常熟悉，就好像这些线条塑造在他脑海中，可他并不是非要她不可，他也许可以一辈子不要她。他认为自己被米丽亚姆束缚住了。假如有一天他要结婚的话，他应有责任娶米丽亚姆为妻。他向克莱拉说明了这一点，她什么也没说，由他自己去决定。一有机会，他就去找她——道伍斯太太。同时，他经常给米丽亚姆写信，有时还去探望她。整个冬天就这么度过，似乎他并不大烦恼。母亲对他也比较放心，她以为他和米丽亚姆逐渐疏远了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But she was a married woman, and he believed in simple friendship. And he considered that he was perfectly honourable with regard to her. It was only a friendship between man and woman, such as any civilised persons might have.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是她是个结过婚的女人，而且他只信奉纯朴的友谊。他认为自己对她的情感是光明正大的。他们之间只不过是普普通通的文明男女之间的友谊罢了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Were you horrid with Baxter Dawes?" he asked her. It was a thing that seemed to trouble him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你对巴克斯特·道伍斯态度很坏是吧？”他问她，这事老使他不安。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He saw none of the anomaly of his position. Miriam was his old friend, lover, and she belonged to Bestwood and home and his youth. Clara was a newer friend, and she belonged to Nottingham, to life, to the world. It seemed to him quite plain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他丝毫也未觉察到自己的处境有什么变化。米丽亚姆是他的故友、情人，她属于贝斯伍德，属于家庭和他的青年时代。相比而言，克莱拉是个新朋友，她属于诺丁汉姆，属于生活、属于人间。对他来说，一切很明了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Miriam knew now how strong was the attraction of Clara for him; but still she was certain that the best in him would triumph. His feeling for Mrs. Dawes -- who, moreover, was a married woman-was shallow and temporal, compared with his love for herself. He would come back to her, she was sure; with some of his young freshness gone, perhaps, but cured of his desire for the lesser things which other women than herself could give him. She could bear all if he were inwardly true to her and must come back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="米丽亚姆也知道此时克莱拉对他的吸引力有多大，可是她依然相信他的良知一定会胜利。他对道伍斯太太的感情，比起她的爱来要浅薄得多，而且非常短暂，何况，道伍斯太太是结过婚的女人，她肯定他一定会回到她身边的，说不定还会退去几分稚气，医治他对低下事物的欲望，这种欲望只有其他女人可以满足他，她可不行。只要他的心对她是忠实的，并且回到她身边来，她一切都可以忍受。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“哪方面？”">查看中文翻译</div>
