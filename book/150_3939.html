<div class="line_en">Kitty fell again into the comfortable routine of her work and though in the early morning feeling far from well she had spirit enough not to let it discompose her. She was astonished at the interest the nuns took in her: sisters who, when she saw them in a corridor, had done no more than bid her good morning now on a flimsy pretext came into the room in which she was occupied and looked at her, chatting a little, with a sweet and childlike excitement. Sister St Joseph told her with a repetition which was sometimes tedious how she had been saying to herself for days past: "Now, I wonder," or: "I shouldn't be surprised"; and then, when Kitty fainted: "There can be no doubt, it jumps to the eyes." She told Kitty long stories of her sister-in- law's confinements, which but for Kitty's quick sense of humour would have been not a little alarming. Sister St Joseph combined in a pleasant fashion the realistic outlook of her upbringing (a river wound through the meadows of her father's farm and the poplars that stood on its bank trembled in the faintest breeze) with a charming intimacy with religious things. One day, firmly convinced that a heretic could know nothing of such matters, she told Kitty of the Annunciation.</div>

<div class="line_en">The mystery of birth blew through the convent like a little fitful wind playing among the white blossoms of an orchard. The thought that Kitty was with child disturbed and excited those sterile women. She frightened them a little now and fascinated them. They looked upon the physical side of her condition with robust common sense, for they were the daughters of peasants and fishermen; but in their childlike hearts was awe. They were troubled by the thought of her burden and yet happy and strangely exalted. Sister St Joseph told her that they all prayed for her, and Sister St Martin had said what a pity it was she was not a Catholic; but the Mother Superior had reproved her; she said that it was possible to be a good woman -- une brave femme, she put it -- even though one was Protestant and le bon Dieu would in some way or other arrange all that.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I must take care that you do not tire yourself, mоп enfant," she said, making a transparent excuse to herself, "or Dr. Fane will never forgive me. Oh, this British self-control! There he is delighted beyond measure and when you speak to him of it he becomes quite pale."</div>

<div class="line_en">Kitty was both touched and diverted by the interest she aroused, but surprised beyond measure when she found that even the Mother Superior, so austere in her saintliness, treated her with a new complaisance. She had always been kind to Kitty, but in a remote fashion; now she used her with a tenderness in which there was something maternal. Her voice had in it a new and gentle note and in her eyes was a sudden playfulness as though Kitty were a child who had done a clever and amusing thing. It was oddly moving. Her soul was like a calm, grey sea rolling majestically, awe-inspiring in its sombre greatness, and then suddenly a ray of sunshine made it alert, friendly and gay. Often now in the evening she would come and sit with Kitty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凯蒂对自己的受人瞩目不禁受宠若惊，不过最叫她惊奇的还是一向肃穆、圣洁的修道院长也对她另眼相待了。修道院长对凯蒂向来不错，但总叫人觉得隔着一点距离。现在她对凯蒂就像母亲对待宝贝女儿似的。她的声音也变了，有种跟以前不同的温柔的调子。眼睛里那个欣喜的神情，好像凯蒂是个孩子，做了件讨大人喜欢的事儿一样，这叫凯蒂异常感动。院长的灵魂就像一汪波浪涌动的大海，沉雄静穆使人敬畏，顷刻间一道阳光照射到海面上，使之顿时变得活泼欢跃起来。如今每逢傍晚，她常常来跟凯蒂坐上一会儿。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Kitty smiled and in her heart sighed. There was only one thing she could do for Walter now and that she could not think how to. She wanted him to forgive her, not for her sake any more, but for his own; for she felt that this alone could give him peace of mind. It was useless to ask him for his forgiveness, and if he had a suspicion that she desired it for his good rather than hers his stubborn vanity would make him refuse at all costs (it was curious that his vanity now did not irritate her, it seemed natural and only made her sorrier for him); and the only chance was that some unexpected occurrence might throw him off his guard. She had an idea that he would welcome an uprush of emotion which would liberate him from his nightmare of resentment, but that, in his pathetic folly, he would tight when it came with all his might against it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凯蒂对修道院长示以微笑，然而心里却叹息了一声。现在她唯一能给瓦尔特做的事却不知如何去做。她希望他能原谅她，不是为了她，而是为了他自己，因为只有这样他才能得到心灵上的宁静。求他原谅是无济于事的，要是他怀疑她是冲着他心地好，想骗得他的原谅，而自己根本没想改过自新，那就更得不偿失了。以他那股子虚荣心，无论如何也会断然拒绝的（有意思的是他的虚荣心不再激怒她了，倒觉得是人之常情，为她曾给他的虚荣心带来伤害而更加歉疚）。要想让他回心转意，只能等什么意料不到的事从天而降，从此打消他的芥蒂。她想他或许也希望有什么事让他心潮汹涌，一举把他从怨恨的梦魇里解救出来。但话说回来，以他可怜的荒唐脑筋，若真是事到临头，怕又会执拗到底，九头牛也拉不回来。">查看中文翻译</div>

That was kind of you, my dear child, and I want you to know that we appreciate the help you have been to us. But I think that you did not want to leave him either, and that is better, for your place is by his side, and he needs you. Ah, I do not know what we should have done without that admirable man."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“费恩医生跟我说他希望你回去，但是你舍不得离开我们。你太善良了，我亲爱的孩子。我想让你知道，你给我们带来的帮助我们非常感激。不过我想你也是不想剩下他一个人，这样更好，因为你是他的妻子，他需要你。啊，真不知道没有他我们应该怎么办。”">查看中文翻译</div>
