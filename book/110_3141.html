<div class="line_en">I felt better when, at last, I did get a letter from him. Jonathan said that he was coming home and was at Bistritz. But again it was a short, strange letter. "Perhaps he's ill," I thought.</div>

<div class="line_en">While Jonathan was away, I was very unhappy. He did not write to me often, and when he did, his letters were strange and very short. I knew that something was wrong. But what? Was Jonathan in danger? I thought about him all the time. Why didn't he come back to England and to me?</div>

<div class="line_en">Lucy met me at the station, and it was wonderful to see her again. She was full of life and talked happily of her plans. "Oh, Mina," she said to me. "I am really happy. I love Arthur very much."</div>

<div class="line_en">I knew that Lucy sometimes liked to go and sit quietly in the churchyard, so I hurried out into the night to look for her. And I found her. She was sitting in the churchyard, white in the moonlight, and I thought I saw something dark behind her -- something dark and horrible. Slowly, its head moved nearer to Lucy. Afraid, I called out, "Lucy! Lucy!" A white face and burning red eyes looked up at me -- and then, nothing! Lucy was alone, asleep in the moonlight. I woke her, and she gave a little cry. She put her hands to her neck, and I saw that there were two little drops of blood there.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我知道露西有时喜欢去教堂的庭院中静静地坐着，于是我乘着夜色，匆匆地出去找她。我找到了她。她坐在教堂的庭院里，月光下她显得很苍白。而我好像看到她身后有个黑色的东西——一种黑色而可怕的东西。它的头正慢慢地靠近露西。我吓得大声叫喊：“露西！露西！”它抬起头来，脸色惨白，一双血红的眼睛死盯着我——突然间，一切又都没有了！露西一个人睡在月光下。我叫醒了她，她呻吟了一声。她用手去摸脖子，我看见她脖子上有两点血迹。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That night I woke up and found that the bedroom door was open and Lucy was not there. I looked for her everywhere in the house, but I could not find her. "I'm afraid for her, I don't know why," I said to her mother.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天夜里，我醒来发现卧室的门开着，露西不见了。我在家里四处找她，但没能找到。“不知为什么，我很为她担心。”我对她母亲说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After that night Lucy was worse. She left her bed every night and her lovely face was white. I was afraid for her and locked the door at night. And I still did not hear from Jonathan. I was unhappy and did not sleep well myself, so one night I went for a walk alone. "Lucy will be all right," I thought. "The door is locked. She can't get out, and no one can get in." But when I came back, I found Lucy by the open window. "Lucy!" I cried. But she did not reply. She was asleep, and near her, just outside the open window, there was something black, like a big bird.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那一晚之后，露西的情况更糟了。她每晚都梦游，而且她可爱的脸也愈加苍白。我很为她担心，晚上就把门锁上了。仍然没有乔纳森的消息。我心情不佳，晚上也睡不好，于是一天晚上，我独自出去散步。“露西不会有事的，”我想，“门已经锁上了。她出不来，也没人能进得去。”但当我回来时，却发现露西站在敞开的窗户旁边。“露西！”我大叫。但她没有问答。她还睡着呢，而在她的旁边，就在敞开的窗户外面，有一个黑影，很像一只大鸟。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A day or two later, I had a letter. Jonathan was ill and in hospital in Budapest. "Of course, I must go to him immediately," I said to Lucy. I did not want to leave her, but Jonathan was everything to me. "He needs me," I said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一两天以后，我收到了一封信。乔纳森病了，住在布达佩斯的一家医院里。“当然，我必须马上去看他。”我对露西说。我不想离开她，但乔纳森是我的一切。“他需要我。”我说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And when at last I arrived in Budapest and held Jonathan in my arms, I felt happy. Jonathan was very ill but he was getting better every day. He did not want to talk about his time in Castle Dracula, but he gave me his diary to read. And so I learnt about Count Dracula and Jonathan's terrible adventure in the castle. But he escaped! And when he fell ill in the mountains, some workmen found him and took him to the hospital. Poor Jonathan! His face was white and thin, and he was still very afraid, but now we were together again and everything was all right.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当我终于到达布达佩斯，把乔纳森抱在怀里的时候，我感到非常高兴。乔纳森病得很重，但他正在一天天好起来。他不想谈他在德拉库拉城堡的那段日子，但他让我读了他的日记。我这才知道了德拉库拉伯爵以及乔纳森在城堡里的可怕经历。但他终于逃脱了！他在山里病倒后，一些工人发现了他，并把他送到了医院。可怜的乔纳森！他的脸苍白而消瘦，他仍然非常害怕，不过现在我们又在一起了，一切都很好。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jonathan and I were married on September 1st, and then we began our journey home. We arrived back in England on September 18th, and it was wonderful to be home again. Everyone looked happy on that warm autumn evening, when we drove through the streets of London. Jonathan smiled and said softly, "Oh Mina, I love you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我和乔纳森9月1日结婚，之后就启程回家。9月18日，我们回到了英国，回到家的感觉真好。在那个秋天温暖的黄昏，我们驾车在伦敦的大街上穿行着，人们看起来都很快乐。乔纳森微笑着轻声说：“哦，明娜，我爱你。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jonathan put his head in his hands and said nothing for the rest of the journey. I was very afraid for him. Was it really true -- that this horrible Count Dracula was here in London?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="乔纳森手抱着头，余下的路上一句话也没说。我很为他担心。那是真的吗——那个可怕的德拉库拉伯爵就在伦敦？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我也爱你，乔纳森。”我回答说。我真的幸福极了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And then, suddenly, Jonathan's face went white, and he cried out. He was looking at a carriage, outside a shop. In it there was a pretty girl with dark hair. She was waiting for someone. And near the carriage, watching the pretty girl, there was a man -- a tall, thin man, with long white teeth and a very red mouth. "It's the Count!" Jonathan cried. "Here in London!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="随后，突然间，乔纳森的脸变得煞白，大叫了一声。他正盯着一辆停在商店外面的马车看。马车里坐着一位黑头发的漂亮姑娘，她正在等人。马车附近，有个男人，正在注视着这个漂亮女孩——一个瘦高的男人，牙齿又长又白，嘴唇血红。“这就是伯爵！”乔纳森叫道，“他在伦敦！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Soon after you left," Arthur wrote, "Lucy began to get worse. I did not know what to do. I knew only that I must do something quickly, so I asked our old friend, Jack Seward, to come and see her. "He's a doctor," I thought. "Perhaps he can do something to help Lucy." He came at once, but in the end nobody could help poor Lucy, and she died yesterday."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你走后不久，”阿瑟写道，“露西的病情就开始恶化。我不知道该怎么做，只知道必须马上做点儿什么，因此我找了我的朋友杰克·苏厄德来看她。‘他是个医生，’我想，‘或许他能做些什么来帮助露西。’他立刻就来了，但最终没有人能帮上可怜的露西的忙，她在昨天永远地去了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
