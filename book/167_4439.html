<div class="line_en">It was the wagons that slowed them, lumbering along, axles creaking under the weight of their heavy loads. A dozen times a day they had to stop to free a wheel that had stuck in a rut, or double up the teams to climb a muddy slope. Once, in the middle of a dense stand of oak, they came face-to-face with three men pulling a load of firewood in an ox cart, with no way for either to get around. There had been nothing for it but to wait while the foresters unhitched their ox, led him through the trees, spun the cart, hitched the ox up again, and started back the way they'd come. The ox was even slower than the wagons, so that day they hardly got anywhere at all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="拖慢速度的是马车，它们载重很多，车轴嘎吱作响，隆隆行进。一天里，必须停下十几次，把卡在车辙里的轮子拉出来；要么就是临时增加拉车的牲口，以助其爬上泥泞斜坡。还有一次，在一片浓密的橡树林中，他们迎面碰上一部三人合拉的牛车，上面堆满了柴薪，双方都无路可让，最后只好等那几个樵夫解开缰绳，把牛牵进林子，掉转车头，再把牛重新拴上，原路返回。那头牛比马车还慢，所以那天等于就这么浪费掉了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The bad part was, the road wound back and forth like a snake, tangling with even smaller trails and sometimes seeming to vanish entirely only to reappear half a league farther on when they had all but given up hope. Arya hated it. The land was gentle enough, rolling hills and terraced fields interspersed with meadows and woodlands and little valleys where willows crowded close to slow shallow streams. Even so, the path was so narrow and crooked that their pace had dropped to a crawl.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="坏处呢，这路像蛇一般前后蜿蜒，有时和荒僻小径交杂缠绕，有时则几乎完全消失，等他们快放弃希望，才在一两里外又复出现。艾莉亚讨厌这样的状况。附近地势并不崎岖，丘陵和梯田高低起伏，草地、树林和小溪谷点缀其间；溪谷中，水流缓慢，柳树夹岸。风景虽美，路径却非常狭窄，左弯右拐，使他们前进的速度几与爬行无异。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Lommy and the other orphans all treated the Bull like someone special now because the queen wanted his head, though he would have none of it. "I never did nothing to no queen," he said angrily. "I did my work, is all. Bellows and tongs and fetch and carry. I was s'posed to be an armorer, and one day Master Mott says I got to join the Night's Watch, that's all I know." Then he'd go off to polish his helm. It was a beautiful helm, rounded and curved, with a slit visor and two great metal bull's horns. Arya would watch him polish the metal with an oilcloth, shining it so bright you could see the flames of the cookfire reflected in the steel. Yet he never actually put it on his head.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="自从知道太后要大牛的脑袋之后，罗米这群孤儿便把他当特殊人物看待，他一点也不喜欢。“我没招惹什么太后！”他生气地说，“我从来就只管做好分内的活，吹风炉、打铁、搬东西、作杂务，我想当个武器匠，可有天莫特师父要我加入守夜人，我知道的就这么多。”说完他就擦头盔去了。他那顶头盔的确漂亮，浑圆有致，面罩上留有眼缝，此外还有两大根金属牛角。艾莉亚瞧他拿着油布仔细擦拭，擦得峥亮无比，映照出熊熊营火。但他从不把头盔戴上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Arya could not help looking over her shoulder, wondering when the gold cloaks would catch them. At night, she woke at every noise to grab for Needle's hilt. They never made camp without putting out sentries now, but Arya did not trust them, especially the orphan boys. They might have done well enough in the alleys of King's Landing, but out here they were lost. When she was being quiet as a shadow, she could sneak past all of them, flitting out by starlight to make her water in the woods where no one would see. Once, when Lommy Greenhands had the watch, she shimmied up an oak and moved from tree to tree until she was right above his head, and he never saw a thing. She would have jumped down on top of him, but she knew his scream would wake the whole camp, and Yoren might take a stick to her again.</div>

<div class="line_en">"He is not," Arya declared. My father only had one bastard, and that's Jon. She stalked off into the trees, wishing she could just saddle her horse and ride home. She was a good horse, a chestnut mare with a white blaze on her forehead. And Arya had always been a good rider. She could gallop off and never see any of them, unless she wanted to. Only then she'd have no one to scout ahead of her, or watch behind, or stand guard while she napped, and when the gold cloaks caught her, she'd be all alone. It was safer to stay with Yoren and the others.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他才不是！”艾莉亚驳道。我爸只有一个私生子，那就是琼恩。她郁闷地冲进树林，真想就这么跳上马背，一路骑回家。她的坐骑是匹栗子色的母马，额上有道白斑。眼下她不仅有匹好马，自己骑术也一向高明，大可策马飞奔，再也不要看见他们——除非她愿意。可这样一来，就没有人趋前侦察，没有人殿后警戒，更没有人在她瞌睡时站岗守卫了，等金袍子来逮她，她便只有孤身一人，所以还是和尤伦一行人待在一块儿比较安全。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"We're not far from Gods Eye," the black brother said one morning. "The kingsroad won't be safe till we're across the Trident. So we'll come up around the lake along the western shore, they're not like to look for us there." At the next spot where two ruts cut cross each other, he turned the wagons west.</div>

<div class="line_en">Here farmland gave way to forest, the villages and holdfasts were smaller and farther apart, the hills higher and the valleys deeper. Food grew harder to come by. In the city, Yoren had loaded up the wagons with salt fish, hard bread, lard, turnips, sacks of beans and barley, and wheels of yellow cheese, but every bite of it had been eaten. Forced to live off the land, Yoren turned to Koss and Kurz, who'd been taken as poachers. He would send them ahead of the column, into the woods, and come dusk they would be back with a deer slung between them on a pole or a brace of quail swinging from their belts. The younger boys would be set to picking blackberries along the road, or climbing fences to fill a sack with apples if they happened upon an orchard.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从此农地换为森林，村落和庄园变得更小也更分散，丘陵更高，山谷更深，食物也越来越难取得。出城前，尤伦把马车塞满了咸鱼、硬面包、猪油、芜菁、一袋袋的青豆和大麦，还有大轮的黄奶酪，到如今却全吃完了。他们只好自立更生。尤伦派前盗猎者寇斯和库兹到队伍前方，深入林区，到黄昏时分，他们准能在肩上用树枝扛起一头鹿，或是腰上晃荡着一票鹌鹑回归队伍。年纪较小的男孩被派去捡拾沿路的黑莓，若经过果园，则得偷偷爬过篱笆，背一袋苹果回来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Outside a holdfast called Briarwhite, some fieldhands surrounded them in a cornfield, demanding coin for the ears they'd taken. Yoren eyed their scythes and tossed them a few coppers. "Time was, a man in black was feasted from Dorne to Winterfell, and even high lords called it an honor to shelter him under their roofs," he said bitterly. "Now cravens like you want hard coin for a bite of wormy apple." He spat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="后来他们在一个名叫白荆庄的庄园田里采了几穗玉米，结果一群庄稼汉把他们团团围住，要他们付钱。尤伦瞄瞄对方手中的镰刀，丢了几个铜板出去。“要是以前啊，咱们黑衫军不论在多恩还是临冬城都会受到盛情款待，有黑衣弟兄来家中投宿，达官贵人都觉得荣幸。”他悻悻地说，“现在这些瘪三连咬两口烂苹果也要钱。”他啐了一口吓唬你的乌鸦同胞。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Arya was a skilled climber and a fast picker, and she liked to go off by herself. One day she came across a rabbit, purely by happenstance. It was brown and fat, with long ears and a twitchy nose. Rabbits ran faster than cats, but they couldn't climb trees half so well. She whacked it with her stick and grabbed it by its ears, and Yoren stewed it with some mushrooms and wild onions. Arya was given a whole leg, since it was her rabbit. She shared it with Gendry. The rest of them each got a spoonful, even the three in manacles. Jaqen H'ghar thanked her politely for the treat, and Biter licked the grease off his dirty fingers with a blissful look, but Rorge, the noseless one, only laughed and said, "There's a hunter now. Lumpyface Lumpyhead Rabbitkiller."</div>

<div class="line_en">They roasted the sweetcorn in the husk that night, turning the ears with long forked sticks, and ate it hot right off the cob. Arya thought it tasted wonderful, but Yoren was too angry to eat. A cloud seemed to hang over him, ragged and black as his cloak. He paced about the camp restlessly, muttering to himself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当天晚上，他们连皮带谷烤了那些甜玉米，用几根分叉的长树枝穿过穗心，架在火上翻烤，熟了以后就直接吃。艾莉亚觉得美味极了，但尤伦却气得吃不下。他头上似乎罩着一片乌云，像他的斗篷一样褴褛乌黑。他在营地里走来走去，口中念念有词。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The next day Koss came racing back to warn Yoren of a camp ahead. "Twenty or thirty men, in mail and halfhelms," he said. "Some of them are cut up bad, and one's dying, from the sound of him. With all the noise he was making, I got right up close. They got spears and shields, but only one horse, and that's lame. I think they been there awhile, from the stink of the place."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="隔天，寇斯在前方发现军营，便赶回来警告尤伦。“大概二三十个人，穿着锁甲和半罩盔。”他说，“有些人伤得很重，还有一个听起来快死了。他声音很吵，我就大着胆子凑过去看，只见他们身边有矛有盾，但只有一匹马，还是跛的。我看他们待在那儿好一阵子啦，臭死人了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's sweetcorn, better'n a stinking old black bird like you deserves," one of them answered roughly. "You get out of our field now, and take these sneaks and stabbers with you, or we'll stake you up in the corn to scare the other crows away."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“咱们种的是甜玉米，你这臭死人的老黑鸟还不配吃咧！”一个庄汉粗声粗气地回嘴，“还不快从咱们田里滚出去！顺便把你这群人渣杂碎带走，否则咱们把你叉起来吓唬你的乌鸦同胞！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Yoren folded a sourleaf into his mouth and chewed. "Can't say," he admitted. "Might be one side, might be t'other. If they're hurt that bad, likely they'd take our mounts no matter who they are. Might be they'd take more than that. I believe we'll go wide around them." It took them miles out of their way, and cost them two days at the least, but the old man said it was cheap at the price. "You'll have time enough on the Wall. The rest o' your lives, most like. Seems to me there's no rush to get there."</div>

<div class="line_en">Arya saw men guarding the fields more and more when they turned north again. Often they stood silently beside the road, giving a cold eye to anyone who passed. Elsewhere they patrolled on horses, riding their fence lines with axes strapped to their saddles. At one place, she spotted a man perched up in a dead tree, with a bow in his hand and a quiver hanging from the branch beside him. The moment he spied them, he notched an arrow to his bowstring, and never looked away until the last wagon was out of sight. All the while, Yoren cursed. "Him in his tree, let's see how well he likes it up there when the Others come to take him. He'll scream for the Watch then, that he will."</div>

<div class="line_en">Riding out in front of the wagons on her horse, Arya saw burnt bodies impaled on sharpened stakes atop the walls, their hands drawn up tight in front of their faces as if to fight off the flames that had consumed them. Yoren called a halt when they were still some distance off, and told Arya and the other boys to guard the wagons while he and Murch and Cutjack went in on foot. A flock of ravens rose from inside the walls when they climbed through the broken gate, and the caged ravens in their wagons called out to them with quorks and raucous shrieks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="艾莉亚踢踢马，跑到货车前面，发现墙垒的削尖木桩上插着一具具烧焦的尸体，他们双手高举掩面，似乎要挥去焚身烈焰。未到庄园，尤伦便令众人停下，嘱咐艾莉亚和其他男孩守着马车，自己带慕奇和凯杰克徒步趋前探查。他们翻过破败的大门，惊起墙内群鸦，马车里，笼内的乌鸦朝着同类嘎嘎怪叫。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was midday when they arrived at the place where the village had been. The fields were a charred desolation for miles around, the houses blackened shells. The carcasses of burnt and butchered animals dotted the ground, under living blankets of carrion crows that rose, cawing furiously, when disturbed. Smoke still drifted from inside the holdfast. Its timber palisade looked strong from afar, but had not proved strong enough.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="恰近正午时分，他们抵达了村落的废墟。方圆数里的田地一片焦土，房舍只剩焦黑残躯。被烧焦或屠杀的畜尸散布各处，身上盖满争食腐肉的鸦群，彷如游动的毛毯。它们一被惊扰便振翅飞起，嘎嘎怒叫。浓烟仍旧从远处的庄园里冒出，从这里看来，环绕庄园的栅栏颇为坚固，但事实证明根本不够。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When they finally returned, Yoren had a little girl in his arms, and Murch and Cutjack were carrying a woman in a sling made of an old torn quilt. The girl was no older than two and she cried all the time, a whimpery sound, like something was caught in her throat. Either she couldn't talk yet or she had forgotten how. The woman's right arm ended in a bloody stump at her elbow, and her eyes didn't seem to see anything, even when she was looking right at it. She talked, but she only said one thing. "Please," she cried, over and over. "Please. Please." Rorge thought that was funny. He laughed through the hole in his face where his nose had been, and Biter started laughing too, until Murch cursed them and told them to shut up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后他们总算回来了。尤伦怀抱一个小女孩，慕奇和凯杰克则抬着一个破旧棉被做的担架，上面躺着一个女人。女孩不到两岁，哭个不停，发出一种近似呜咽的声响，彷佛有什么东西卡在喉咙里出不来。她可能还不会说话，或者忘记了该怎么说。女人右手自肘部齐齐断裂，伤口血肉模糊，她眼神涣散，对周遭事物毫无反应。她可以说话，但只会一句：“求求你！”她大声地、反复地喊，“求求你！求求你！”罗尔杰觉得很滑稽，便纵声大笑，笑声从原本是鼻子的凹洞内传出，不多久尖牙也跟着笑起来，直到慕奇一阵咒骂，叫他们闭嘴。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Arya rode as far ahead of the wagons as she dared, so she wouldn't have to hear the little girl crying or listen to the woman whisper, "Please." She remembered a story Old Nan had told once, about a man imprisoned in a dark castle by evil giants. He was very brave and smart and he tricked the giants and escaped… but no sooner was he outside the castle than the Others took him, and drank his hot red blood. Now she knew how he must have felt.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="艾莉亚壮起胆子，尽量骑在马车前方，远离小女孩的啜泣，远离那女人的低语：“求求你”。她想起老奶妈说的故事：从前有个英雄被邪恶的巨人囚禁在一座阴森的城堡里，他智勇双全，用计骗过巨人，逃了出去…可一出城堡，就被异鬼抓去，全身的鲜血都给喝个干净。艾莉亚现在可以体会他的感受了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No fire tonight," Yoren told them. Supper was a handful of wild radishes Koss found, a cup of dry beans, water from a nearby brook. The water had a funny taste to it, and Lommy told them it was the taste of bodies, rotting someplace upstream. Hot Pie would have hit him if old Reysen hadn't pulled them apart.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“今晚不许生火。”尤伦对他们说。当天的晚餐是寇斯找到的一把野萝卜，一杯干豆，以及附近小溪的水。溪水有股怪味，罗米说上游一定有腐烂的尸体，才会是这种味道。若不是老雷森把他俩拉开，热派差点就跟他大打出手。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The one-armed woman died at evenfall. Gendry and Cutjack dug her grave on a hillside beneath a weeping willow. When the wind blew, Arya thought she could hear the long trailing branches whispering, "Please. Please. Please." The little hairs on the back of her neck rose, and she almost ran from the graveside.</div>

<div class="line_en">Arya drank too much water, just to fill her belly with something. She never thought she'd be able to sleep, yet somehow she did. When she woke, it was pitch-black and her bladder was full to bursting. Sleepers huddled all around her, wrapped in blankets and cloaks. Arya found Needle, stood, listened. She heard the soft footfalls of a sentry, men turning in restless sleep, Rorge's rattling snores, and the queer hissing sound that Biter made when he slept. From a different wagon came the steady rhythmic scrape of steel on stone as Yoren sat, chewing sourleaf and sharpening the edge of his dirk.</div>

<div class="line_en">One of them came padding out from under the trees. He stared at her, and bared his teeth, and all she could think was how stupid she'd been and how Hot Pie would gloat when they found her half-eaten body the next morning. But the wolf turned and raced back into the darkness, and quick as that the eyes were gone. Trembling, she cleaned herself and laced up and followed a distant scraping sound back to camp, and to Yoren. Arya climbed up into the wagon beside him, shaken. "Wolves," she whispered hoarsely. "In the woods."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="其中一只从树下朝她走来，露出牙齿盯着她看。她满脑子都在埋怨自己有多蠢，心想等明早大家发现她被吃了一半的尸体，热派一定会幸灾乐祸。可那只狼却突然转身，快步跑进黑暗，所有的眼睛都跟着消失。她颤抖着上完厕所，穿上裤子，循着远处模糊的磨刀声回到营地，找到尤伦。艾莉亚爬上马车，坐在他身旁，浑身发抖。“有狼，”她哑着嗓子小声说，“林子里有狼。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I don't think I need to go after all." She went back to her blanket and pretended to sleep until she heard Hot Pie's footsteps going away. Then she rolled over and slipped off into the woods on the other side of the camp, quiet as a shadow. There were sentries out this way too, but Arya had no trouble avoiding them. Just to make sure, she went out twice as far as usual. When she was sure there was no one near, she skinned down her breeches and squatted to do her business.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那我不要解了。”她回去拉起毯子，假装入睡，等听见热派脚步渐远，方才翻身起来，溜进营地另一边的森林，静如影。为保险起见，她走得比往常更远，待确定四下无人之后，才解开裤子，蹲下办事。">查看中文翻译</div>
