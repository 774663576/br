<div class="line_en">I am now faced with the distasteful task of recording a definite drop in Lolita's morals. If her share in the ardors she kindled had never amounted to much, neither had pure lucre ever come to the fore. But I was weak, I was not wise, my schoolgirl nymphet had me in thrall. With the human element dwindling, the passion, the tenderness, and the torture only increased; and of this she took advantage.</div>

<div class="line_en">Her weekly allowance, paid to her under condition she fulfill her basic obligations, was twenty-one cents at the start of the Beardsley era -- and went up to one dollar five before its end. This was a more than generous arrangement seeing she constantly received from me all kinds of small presents and had for the asking any sweetmeat or movie under the moon -- although, of course, I might fondly demand an additional kiss, or even a whole collection of assorted caresses, when I knew she coveted very badly some item of juvenile amusement. She was, however, not easy to deal with. Only very listlessly did she earn her three pennies -- or three nickels -- per day; and she proved to be a cruel negotiator whenever it was in her power to deny me certain life-wrecking, strange, slow paradisal philters without which I could not live more than a few days in a row, and which, because of the very nature of love's languor, I could not obtain by force. Knowing the magic and might of her own soft mouth, she managed -- during one schoolyear!-- to raise the bonus price of a fancy embrace to three, and even four bucks. O Reader! Laugh not, as you imagine me, on the very rack of joy noisily emitting dimes and quarters, and great big silver dollars like some sonorous, jingly and wholly demented machine vomiting riches; and in the margin of that leaping epilepsy she would firmly clutch a handful of coins in her little fist, which, anyway, I used to pry open afterwards unless she gave me the slip, scrambling away to hide her loot. And just as every other day I would cruise all around the school area and on comatose feet visit drugstores, and peer into foggy lanes, and listen to receding girl laughter in between my heart throbs and the falling leaves, so every now and then I would burgle her room and scrutinize torn papers in the wastebasket with the painted roses, and look under the pillow of the virginal bed I had just made myself. Once I found eight one-dollar notes in one of her books (fittingly -- Treasure Island), and once a hole in the wall behind Whistler's Mother yielded as much as twenty-four dollars and some change -- say twenty-four sixty -- which I quietly removed, upon which, next day, she accused, to my face, honest Mrs. Holigan of being a filthy thief. Eventually, she lived up to her I. Q. by finding a safer hoarding place which I never discovered; but by that time I had brought prices down drastically by having her earn the hard and nauseous way permission to participate in the school's theatrical program; because what I feared most was not that she might ruin me, but that she might accumulate sufficient cash to run away. I believe the poor fierce-eyed child had figured out that with a mere fifty dollars in her purse she might somehow reach Broadway or Hollywood -- or the foul kitchen of a diner (Help Wanted) in a dismal ex-prairie state, with the wind blowing, and the stars blinking, and the cars, and the bars, and the barmen, and everything soiled, torn, dead.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="每周给她的零用钱以她履行了基本职责为条件，在比尔兹利时期初是二十一美分——时期结束前涨到一元五分。此外她还不时从我这儿得到各种各样的小礼物。一要就有蜜饯吃或有露天电影看。这实在足够大方。当然了，我也很乐意要求她多吻我一次，甚或当我觉察她极为垂涎某种孩子的娱乐时，就要求一次尽情抚爱。但她的确很难对付。她一天若只得三便士或三个五分币就无精打采；事实证明，每当她权力在握要否定我的某种生命援救物，比如奇异、慢性的春药时，她是个多么冷酷的谈判者；离了那药，我甚至活不上几天；然而正因为情欲的本性十分衰弱，我又不能用武力达到目的。她自知那张柔软嘴唇的魔力，她竟得以——在上学的一年里！——将一次拥抱的昂贵利钱提高到三、甚至四元，噢，不要哂笑，想象我是悬在快乐的刑台上，它就象一架叮当大响、喷吐富贵的疯狂机器，吵闹着吐出了一角银币和二十五分币以及大额银元；而她眼看我处于癫狂状态，便在小拳头里死死抓住一把硬币，事后我倒是总能把它撬开，除非她趁我不备跑到一边藏好她的战利品。每隔一天，我都要到学校四周巡视，昏昏然步入药店，我窥视雾气朦胧的深巷，窃听那回响在我震颤的心和落叶之间的女学生们远去的欢声笑语，我不时潜入她的房间，审察画着玫瑰的废物筐里撕碎的纸片，又细看那张我亲手制做的处女床的枕下。有一次我在她的一本书（真巧——《宝岛》）里找出了八张一元的钞票，又有一次从“惠斯勒之母”后面的墙洞里找出二十四元和一些零钱——总计二十四元六角——我悄悄携走了，第二天，她对我指控霍利根太太是卑鄙的盗贼。最后，她凭智力又找到一个更安全的贮藏地，我再也没找到；但从那以后，我便让她费尽气力取得了参加学校演剧活动的准许，也就彻底降低了她的身价；因为我最怕的，不是她可能毁掉我，而是怕她会攒足钱跑掉。我相信这可怜的、目光凶狠的孩子已经想到，用她钱包里的五十元就能投奔百老汇或好莱坞——或大草原以外荒凉地方的某个恶臭的饭馆（召工！）；风儿在吹，星垦在闪，小汽车，酒馆，酒保，一切的一切都肮脏，破烂，死了。">查看中文翻译</div>
