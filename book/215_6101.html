<div class="line_en">I'd never been embarrassed by where we lived before. I'd never looked at our house, or even our side of the street, and said, Oh! I wish we lived in the new development -- those houses are so much newer, so much better! This is where I'd grown up. This was my home.</div>

<div class="line_en">I was aware of the yard, sure. My mother had grumbled about it for years. But it was a low grumbling, not worthy of deep concern. Or so I'd supposed. But maybe I should have wondered. Why let the outside go and keep the inside so nice? It was spotless inside our house. Except for the boys' room, that is. Mom gave up on that after she discovered the snake. If they were old enough to adopt a snake, she told my brothers, they were old enough to clean their own room. Matt and Mike translated this to keep the door closed, and became quite diligent about doing just that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我也意识到了院子的问题，当然。我妈妈因此抱怨了好几年。但是只是简单的抱怨，和更深的焦虑不同，我猜想。但也许我应该仔细想想。为什么不管外面却把里面保持得很好？我们家里面一点灰尘都没有，除了男孩们的房间。我妈妈在发现了蛇之后就放弃了。如果他们已经足够大去养一条蛇，妈妈告诉他们，他们也足够大去打扫自己的房间。马特和迈克把这解释为保持门关闭，而他们对此非常勤奋。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It wasn't just the yard. It was my dad's truck, my mother's car, the family bike that was more rust than steel, and the fact that when we did buy something new, it always seemed to come from a second-time-around store. Plus, we never went on vacation. Ever.</div>

<div class="line_en">Asking my parents whether we were poor seemed incredibly impolite. But as the days went by, I knew I had to ask. Just had to. Every day I'd ride home from school on our rusty bike, pull past the broken fence and patchy yard, and think, Tonight. I'll ask them tonight.</div>

Then it took another half hour of standing around to figure out just where to start. The actual yard was just clumps of weeds, but what about the bordering shrubs? Should I dig them up, or prune them way back? Were they shrubs, or just overgrown weeds? And what about the fence? Should I knock it down, or rebuild it? Maybe I should take out the front end entirely and use the wood to fix up the sides.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was on this last day that Chet asked, "Your family's not moving, are you?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在最后一天切特问道：“你们并不在搬家，是吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Chet was pretty quiet after I told him the story, and when Mom brought us out sandwiches at lunchtime, we sat on the porch and ate without saying a word. Then he broke the silence by nodding across the street and saying, "I don't know why he doesn't just come out and say hello."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="切特在我告诉他这个故事后非常安静，而当我妈妈拿了三明治当午餐时，我们坐在门廊上一言不发地吃饭。然后他打破了沉默，向街对面点了点头说道：“我不知道他为什么不直接过来打招呼。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Even though Chet and I had talked about a lot of things while we were working, I probably wouldn't have told him about Mr. Finnegan or Uncle David or why the yard was such a mess if he hadn't asked me about moving. But since he had, well, I wound up telling him everything. And it felt good to talk about it. Especially about Uncle David. It felt like blowing a dandelion into the wind and watching all the little seeds float off, up and away. I was proud of my parents, and looking around the front yard, I was proud of me, too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽说我和切特在一星期内聊了很多，如果他没有问到搬家，我可能不会告诉他关于芬尼根先生和大卫叔叔，或者为什么院子一团糟。但是既然他问了，唉，我决定告诉他一切。而谈论这些感觉不错。特别是关于大卫叔叔。这感觉就像把一朵蒲公英吹向风，然后看着小小的种子漂浮起来，飞向远方。我为我父母感到骄傲，而看着我们的院子，我也为自己骄傲。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“这已经是我第三次看到他了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Who?" I asked, then looked across the street to where he'd nodded. The curtain in Bryce's room moved quickly back into place, and I couldn't help asking, "Bryce?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“谁？”我问，然后看着街对面他点头的地方。布莱斯房间的窗帘迅速拉上了，而我忍不住问道：“布莱斯？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I was happy to finally be planting the yard, but I couldn't help being distracted by Bryce's window. Was he watching? During the rest of the afternoon, I checked more often than I'd like to admit. And I'm afraid Chet noticed, too, because when we were all done and we'd congratulated each other on what was sure to be a fine-looking yard, he said, "He may be acting like a coward now, but I do hold out hope for the boy."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我为最终能够种植院子感到高兴，但是布莱斯的窗户一直让我分心。他在看吗？整个剩下的下午，我检查的次数连自己都不愿承认。而我害怕切特也注意到了，因为当我们都结束工作，祝贺对方这将会是一个多么好的院子时，他说：“他现在可能还像个懦夫，但我还对那个男孩抱有希望。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A coward? What on earth could I say to that? I just stood there with the hose in one hand and the spigot valve beneath the other.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="懦夫？我怎么会这么说呢？我只是一只手拿着水管，一只手压着阀门，直直地站在那儿。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He frowned and said, "Let's finish up and get that seed sown, shall we? You'll want the warmth of the day to help with the germination."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他皱着眉说：“让我们完成任务并开始撒种，好吗？你会想让它们在最温暖的日子发芽。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I turned my back on him and concentrated on watering the yard. What a fool I was! What a complete idiot! And I had just built up a nice head of angry steam when I heard, "It's looking good, Juli. Nice job."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我背向他并专注于给院子浇水。我多傻啊！我是个十足的傻瓜！当我正建起极高的怒气时，我却听到：“看起来不错啊，朱莉。做得很好。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was Bryce, standing right there on our driveway. And suddenly I wasn't mad at me anymore. I was mad at him. How could he stand there like my supervisor and tell me, Nice job? He had no business saying anything after what he'd done.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="是布莱斯，就站在我们的车道上。突然间我不再因为自己生气了，我在因为他生气。他怎么能像我的监督者似的站在那儿并告诉我，做得很好？他在做了那些事后已经没有资格说任何话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A few minutes later I saw Bryce coming down the sidewalk toward his house. I did a double take. All this time I'd thought he was inside the house watching, and he was really outside walking around? I was embarrassed all over again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="几分钟后我看见布莱斯从街边走向了他们家。我的确想太多了。这整段时间我认为他在家里偷看，但是他事实上却在外面乱逛？我又觉得尴尬起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I was about to hose him down when he said, "I'm sorry for what I did, Juli. It was, you know… wrong."</div>

<div class="line_en">I looked at him -- into those brilliant blue eyes. And I tried to do what Chet had said -- I tried to look past them. What was behind them? What was he thinking? Was he really sorry? Or was he just feeling bad about the things he'd said? It was like looking into the sun, though, and I had to turn away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我看着他——看进那对明亮的蓝眼睛。我试着做切特所说的——我试着看穿它们。这后面究竟有什么呢？他在想什么呢？他真的抱歉吗？还是他只是为他所说的感觉很差？但这就像直视着太阳，而我必须转开。">查看中文翻译</div>
