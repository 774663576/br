<div class="line_en">"Look at this!" exploded George Greggson, hurling the paper across at Jean. It came to rest, despite her efforts to intercept it, spread listlessly across the breakfast table. Jean patiently scraped away the jam and read the offending passage, doing her best to register disapproval. She was not very good at this, because all too often she agreed with the critics. Usually she kept these heretical opinions to herself; and not merely for the sake of peace and quiet. George was perfectly prepared to accept praise from her (or anyone else), but if she ventured any criticism of his work she would receive a crushing lecture on her artistic ignorance.</div>

This is Athens, the other we've christened Sparta. It's rather wild and rocky, and is a wonderful place for sport or exercise." His eye flickered momentarily over his visitor's waistline, and George squirmed slightly in the cane chair. "Sparta is an extinct volcano, by the way.

<div class="line_en">"But back to Athens. The idea of the Colony, as you've gathered, is to build up an independent, stable cultural group with its own artistic traditions.

It's really a piece of applied social engineering, based on some exceedingly complex mathematics which I wouldn't pretend to understand.

<div class="line_en">"Our present population is just over fifty thousand, which is a little short of the desired optimum. That's why we keep our eyes open for recruits. And, of course, there is a certain wastage: we're not yet quite self-supporting in some of the more specialized talents.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Here on this island we're trying to save something of humanity's independence, its artistic traditions. We've no hostility towards the Overlords: we simply want to be left alone to go our own way. When they destroyed the old nations and the way of life man had known since the beginning of history, they swept away many good things with the bad. The world's now placid, featureless and culturally dead: nothing really new has been created since the Overlords came. The reason's obvious. There's nothing left to struggle for, and there are too many distractions and entertainments. Do you realize that every day something like five hundred hours of radio and TV pour out over the various channels? If you went without sleep and did nothing else, you could follow less than a twentieth of the entertainment that's available at the turn of a switch! No wonder that people are becoming passive sponges -- absorbing but never creating. Did you know that the average viewing time per person is now three hours a day? Soon people won't be living their own lives any more. It will be a full-time job keeping up with the various family serials on TV!</div>

About a third of the applicants are rejected, usually for reasons which don't reflect on them and which wouldn't matter outside.

<div class="line_en">There was a long silence. Jean looked at George, who was rubbing thoughtfully at the side-whiskers currently popular in artistic circles. As long as they weren't burning their boats behind them, she was not unduly worried. The Colony looked an interesting place, and certainly wasn't as cranky as she'd feared. And the children would love it. That, in the final analysis, was all that mattered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="说到这儿，大家都不说话了。简看了看乔治，他摩挲着现在艺术界最流行的络腮胡，思考着。只要胡子不烧着他们身后的船，简也懒得操这份心。这个地方看起来很有趣，不像自己担心的那样怪异，更重要的是，孩子们肯定会喜欢这里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They moved in six weeks later. The single-storied house was small, but quite adequate for a family which had no intention of being greater than four. All the basic labour-saving devices were in evidence: at least, Jean admitted, there was no danger of reverting to the dark ages of domestic drudgery. It was slightly disturbing, however, to discover that there was a kitchen. In a community of this size, one would normally expect to dial Food Central, wait five minutes, and then get whatever meal they had selected. Individuality was all very well, but this, Jean feared, might be taking things a little too far. She wondered darkly if she would be expected to make the family's clothes as well as to prepare its meals. But there was no spinning-wheel between the automatic dishwasher and the radar range, so it wasn't quite as bad as that…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="六周之后，他们搬进了新雅典。一层楼的房子很小，但对他们这样一个不打算再要孩子的四口之家来说足够了。一切省劲的设施应有尽有，简不必担心回到操持家务那种暗无天日的生活中去。只是看到厨房时，她有些不高兴。这样规模的社区，人们应该打个电话到食品中心，再等五分钟，就可以吃到食物了，人的个性固然重要，但要在这方面体现个性就有些离谱了。要准备全家人的饭菜，她沮丧地想还要不要缝制全家的衣服呢？幸好，洗碗机和雷达测距仪之间没有织布机，还不至于太惨。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jean moved to the still uncurtained window and looked across the Colony. It was a beautiful place, there was no doubt of that. The house stood on the western slopes of the low bill that dominated, because of the absence of any other competition, the island of Athens. Two kilometres to the north she could see the causeway -- a thin knife-edge dividing the water -- that led to Sparta. That rocky island, with its brooding volcanic cone, was such a contrast to this peaceful spot that it sometimes frightened her. She wondered how, the scientists could be so certain that it would never reawaken and overwhelm them all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="房间还没有挂上窗帘，简走到窗前，往外眺望。新雅典的确很美，他们的房子建在小山的西北坡上，可以放眼俯瞰整个小岛。北边两公里之外一条堤岸通往斯巴达，像一柄利刃切断水流。斯巴达形如火山锥，遍地荒石，与平缓的雅典岛形成鲜明的对比，这种强烈的反差有些让人害怕。不知道那些科学家怎么能断定它不会苏醒过来，吞没这儿所有的居民。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A metallic crash announced the arrival of George's bicycle. Jean wondered how long it was going to take them both to learn to ride. This was yet another unexpected aspect of life on the island. Private cars were not permitted, and indeed were unnecessary, since the greatest distance one could travel in a straight line was less than fifteen kilometres. There were various community-owned service vehicles -- trucks, ambulances, and fire-engines, all restricted, except in cases of real emergency, to fifty kilometres an hour. As a result the inhabitants of Athens had plenty of exercise, uncongested streets -- and no traffic accidents.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="随着“哐当”一声金属碰撞的声音，自行车停下了，要等到什么时候他俩才能学会骑车呢？他们当初根本没有想到还要学骑车，岛上不允许个人拥有车辆，事实上也没有必要，岛上直线距离最长不过十五公里。各种服务性车辆——卡车、救护车、消防车等只有社区才有，这些车辆的使用都受到严格限制，除了真正紧急的情况，车速均不得超过每小时五十公里。人们因此有了更多机会锻炼身体，大街上也不拥挤，更没有车祸。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">New Athens was not a natural and spontaneous growth like the city whose name it bore. Everything about the Colony was deliberately planned, as the result of many years of study by a group of very remarkable men. It had begun as an open conspiracy against the Overlords, an implicit challenge to their policy if not to their power. At first the Colony's sponsors had been more than half certain that Karellen would neatly frustrate them, but the Supervisor had done nothing -- absolutely nothing. This was not quite as reassuring as might have been expected. Karellen had plenty of time: he might be preparing a delayed counterstroke. Or he might be so certain of the project's failure that he felt no need to take any action against it.</div>

<div class="line_en">There were many reasons for choosing an island site. Not the least important were psychological. In an age of universal air transport, the ocean meant nothing as a physical barrier, but it still gave a sense of isolation. Moreover, a limited land area made it impossible for too many people to live in the Colony. The maximum population was fixed at a hundred thousand: more than that, and the advantages inherent in a small, compact community would be lost. One of the aims of the founders was that any member of New Athens should know all the other citizens who shared his interests -- and as many as one or two per cent of the remainder as well.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="出于种种考虑，人们选择小岛来修建这样一个城市，其中主要是心理上的原因，就算现在这样一个航空发达的时代，海洋本身已经不再是一个障碍，却仍给人一种感觉上的隔离；而且，一个面积有限的地方有助于限制居民数量，最多人口不能超过十万，否则，一个彼此联系紧密的小型社会的优势就没有了。这个城市的创建者希望这里的居民除了认识每一个和自己志趣相投的人外，还认识其他百分之一二的人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That the Colony would fail had been the prediction of most people. Yet even in the past, long before any real knowledge of social dynamics had existed, there had been many communities devoted to special religious or philosophical ends. It was true that their mortality rate had been high, but some had survived. And the foundations of New Athens were as secure as modern science could make them.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ben Salomon was no fanatic, but the memories of his childhood must have determined, to no small extent, the philosophy he was to put into practice. He could just remember what the world had been before the advent of the Overlords, and had no wish to return to it. Like not a few other intelligent and well-meaning men, he could appreciate all that Karellen had done for the human race, while still being unhappy about the Supervisor's ultimate plans. Was it possible, he sometimes said to himself that despite all their enormous intelligence the Overlords did not really understand mankind, and were making a terrible mistake from the best of motives? Suppose, in their altruistic passion for justice and order, they had determined to reform the world, but had not realized that they were destroying the soul of man?</div>

They had sympathized because it appealed to their egos, not because it was important for the race. But, once convinced, the world had listened to them and given both moral and material support.

<div class="line_en">There are other, subtler laws, first glimpsed in the early twentieth century by mathematicians such as Weiner and Rashavesky. They had argued that such events as economic depressions, the results of armament races, the stability of social groups, political elections, and so on could be analyzed by the correct mathematical techniques. The great difficulty was the enormous number of variables, many of them hard to define in numerical terms. One could not draw a set of curves and state definitely: "When this line is reached, it will mean war." And one could never wholly allow for such utterly unpredictable events as the assassination of a key figure or the effects of some new scientific discovery -- still less such natural catastrophes as earthquakes or floods, which might haves profound effect on large numbers of people and the social groups in which they lived.</div>

As Salomon himself had remarked: "We can be sure of talent: we can only pray for genius."

Few artists thrive in solitude, and nothing is more stimulating than the conflict of minds with similar interests.</div>

<div class="line_en">Much of the Colony's musical experimenting was, quite consciously, concerned with what might be called "time span". What was the briefest note that the mind could grasp -- or the longest that it could tolerate without boredom? Could the result be varied by conditioning or by the use of appropriate orchestration? Such problems were discussed endlessly, and the arguments were not purely academic. They had resulted in some extremely interesting compositions. But it was in the art of the cartoon film, with its limitless possibilities, that New Athens had made its most successful experiments. The hundred years since the time of Disney had still left much undone in this most flexible of all mediums. On the purely realistic side, results could be produced indistinguishable from actual photography -- much to the contempt of those who were developing the cartoon along abstract lines.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="音乐研究也和时间的长短有关。人们能听清的最短音符是什么？不让人乏味的最长音符又是什么？能通过调音或编曲改变它们吗？人们一直争论着这样的问题，由此还出现了不少有趣的文章。新雅典最成功的艺术成就还是体现在想象丰富的卡通电影艺术上。经历了百年迪斯尼时代之后，还有很多方面值得开拓。单就真实性而言，影片可以达到和实景拍摄一模一样的效果，因此遭到了一些认为卡通片应该走抽象主义道路的人的轻视。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was noticeable -- though a satisfactory explanation for this had not yet been produced -- that time played an essential part in the Colony's most successful artistic achievements. Even its sculpture was seldom immobile. Andrew Carson's intriguing volumes and curves changed slowly as one watched, according to complex patterns that the mind could appreciate, even if it could not fully comprehend them. Indeed, Carson claimed, with some truth, to have taken the "mobiles" of a century before to their ultimate conclusion, and thus to have wedded sculpture and ballet.</div>

<div class="line_en">The group of artists and scientists that had so far done least was the one that had attracted the greatest interest -- and the greatest alarm. This was the team working on "total identification". The history of the cinema gave the clue to their actions. First, sound, then colour, then stereoscopy, then Cinerama, had made the old "moving pictures" more and more like reality itself. Where was the end of the story? Surely, the final stage would be reached when the audience forgot it was an audience, and became part of the action. To achieve this would involve stimulation of all the senses, and perhaps hypnosis as well, but many believed it to be practical. When goal was attained, there would be an enormous enrichment of human experience. A man could become -- for a while, at least -- any other person, and could take part in any conceivable adventure, real or imaginary. He could even be plant or animal, if it proved possible to capture and record the sense impressions of other living creatures. And when the "programme" was over, he would have acquired a memory as vivid as any experience in his actual life -- indeed, indistinguishable from reality itself. The prospect was dazzling. Many also found it terrifying, and hoped that the enterprise would fail. But they knew in their hearts that once science had declared a thing possible, there was no escape from its eventual realization…</div>
