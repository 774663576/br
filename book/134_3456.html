<div class="line_en">She wandered across the lobby, looked through the glass into the barber shop where a couple of men were getting shaves. A Negro boy was shining shoes. A tall man with a cigar and a broad-brimmed hat, with Western shoes, walked by her. She would remember this lobby, too, forever, the people, the old-fashioned looking woodwork at the base of the registration desk, and the man in the dark overcoat who looked at her over the top of his newspaper, and slumped in his chair and went on reading beside the black and cream-colored marble column.</div>

<div class="line_en">Therese set her teeth hard. She watched Carol walk slowly away across the room, watched the space widen, and remembered the first time she had seen her walk so slowly away in the department store, Therese had thought forever. Carol had loved Abby, too, and she reproached herself for it. As Carol would one day for loving her, Therese wondered? Therese understood now why the December and January weeks had been made up of anger and indecision, reprimands alternating with indulgences. But she understood now that whatever Carol said in words, there were no barriers and no indecisions now. There was no Abby, either, after this morning, whatever had happened between Carol and Abby before.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特芮丝咬紧牙关。她看着卡罗尔慢慢走过房间，看着空间逐渐扩大，又想起之前在百货公司第一次遇见卡罗尔的时候，看见卡罗尔走开的那个模样。这个景象，特芮丝已经回想过千万遍了。卡罗尔也曾爱过艾比，但现在卡罗尔却因为这样而不断责怪自己；会不会有一天，特芮丝猜想，卡罗尔也会因为爱上她而自责。特芮丝现在了解了，为什么十二月和一月的那几个礼拜之内，是一种由愤怒、犹豫，责备和宽容互相交替的场景。她现在也了解了，不管卡罗尔嘴上怎么说，从现在起，再也没有界线阻隔，也没有犹豫不决了。无论卡罗尔和艾比以前发生过什么事，从今天早上开始，再也没有艾比了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But Carol seemed deliberately to pay almost no attention to her that day. There was more arrogance in the tilt of her cigarette, in the way she backed the car away from a curb, cursing, not quite joking. "Damned if I'll put a dime in a parking meter with a prairie right in sight," Carol said. But when Therese did catch her looking at her, Carol's eyes were laughing. Carol teased her, leaning on her shoulder as they stood in front of a cigarette machine, touching her foot under tables. It made Therese limp and tense at the same time. She thought of people she had seen holding hands in movies, and why shouldn't she and Carol? Yet when she simply took Carol's arm as they stood choosing a box of candy in a shop, Carol murmured, "Don't."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过今天卡罗尔似乎刻意忽略她，她斜叼着香烟的姿态显得更加高傲了，她从人行道一边倒车一边咒骂着，并不像在开玩笑。“该死！以后如果看见路边有空位，我一定不会把零钱投进这些该死的计时收费器了。”卡罗尔说。可是等到特芮丝真的瞥见卡罗尔偷瞄着自己的时候，卡罗尔的眼睛里有笑意。卡罗尔一直在逗着她玩，两人站在香烟贩卖机前面的时候，卡罗尔故意靠在她的肩膀上；在餐桌底下，卡罗尔又用脚去碰她的脚。特芮丝整个人都放松了，但又觉得很紧张，想起她在电影院里看到好多人手牵着手，她和卡罗尔为什么就不能这样呢？就连她们在店里买盒糖果，而特芮丝只不过是抓着卡罗尔的手臂，卡罗尔就告诉她说：“别这样。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I might tell you the middle," Carol said, "because it's funny -- and ironic. It was last winter when we had the furniture shop together. But I can't begin without telling you the first part --- and that was when we were children. Our families lived near each other in New Jersey, so we saw each other during vacations. Abby always had a mild crush on me, I thought, even when we were about six and eight. Then she wrote me a couple of letters when she was about fourteen and away at school. And by that time I'd heard of girls who preferred girls. But the books also tell you it goes away after that age." There were pauses between her sentences, as if she left out sentences in between.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我可以告诉你中间的部分，”卡罗尔说，“因为，中间比较有趣——而且有点讽刺。去年冬天我们一起开了家具店，可是我又不能不告诉你一开头的故事——很久以前，我们都还是小孩子的时候，我们两家在新泽西州住得很近，所以每次放假的时候就会一起玩。我猜艾比从六岁或八岁开始就一直有点喜欢我。她十四岁那年离家住校，还写了好几封信给我。早在那个时候我就听说过有女孩子喜欢女孩子的事，但是书上总是告诉你，那段年龄过去后，这种感觉就会消失了。”她讲话时偶尔还停顿了一下，仿佛遗漏了几个句子。">查看中文翻译</div>

They waited in the inadequate shelter of a hill at the side of the road.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I never was. My father sent me to a different school, out of town. Then Abby went to Europe when she was sixteen, and I wasn't at home when she came back. I saw her once at some party around the time I got married. Abby looked quite different then, not like a tomboy any more. Then Harge and I lived in another town, and I didn't see her again -- really for years, till long after Rindy was born. She came once in a while to the riding stable where Harge and I used to ride. A few times we all rode together. Then Abby and I started playing tennis on Saturday afternoons when Harge usually played golf. Abby and I always had fun together. Abby's former crush on me never crossed my mind -- we were both so much older and so much had happened. I had an idea about starting a shop, because I wanted to see less of Harge. I thought we were getting bored with each other and it would help. So I asked Abby if she wanted to be partners in it, and we started the furniture shop. After a few weeks to my surprise, I felt I was attracted to her," Carol said in the same quiet voice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“从来没有。我父亲把我送到其他的学校，在另一个城市。艾比十六岁那年去了欧洲，她回来的时候我不在家，后来我结婚前后曾在某个派对上见过她一次。艾比那时候看起来很不一样了，再也不像男孩子了。结婚后我和哈吉住在别的地方，有好几年都没有看到她，直到琳蒂出生很久之后才又见面。她偶尔会去我和哈吉以前常去骑马的马场，还有几次我们三个人一起骑马。后来，艾比和我开始在周六下午打网球，那时哈吉通常在打高尔夫。我和艾比在一起总是很开心。而我从来没有回想过艾比以前对我的迷恋——毕竟那个时候我们两人都长大了，也经历了很多事情。我之所以想要开店，原因是我不想天天看到哈吉。我以为我和哈吉既然已经彼此厌倦，那我开个店，或许会对情况有点帮助。所以我才问艾比，想不想和我合伙开店，接着我们就开了家具店。过了几个礼拜，我开始感到惊讶，我觉得我被她吸引了。”卡罗尔用同样平静的语气说道。">查看中文翻译</div>

The roads were snowed in that night, and Abby's mother insisted that we stay together in Abby's room, simply because the room I'd stayed in before hadn't any sheets on the bed then, and it was very late.

They were almost the only people in the big dining room, and they chose a table near the fireplace. They spread out the road map and decided to head straight for Salt Lake City. They might stay there for a few days, Carol said, because it was an interesting place, and she was tired of driving.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在内布拉斯加州和怀俄明州的边界，她们在一家大餐厅吃晚餐。那家餐厅盖得很像森林里的小屋，而且里面几乎没有别的客人。两人选了靠火炉的位置坐下，摊开地图研究，决定直接前往盐湖城。卡罗尔说那里很好玩，而且她也开车开得烦了，所以可以在盐湖城待上几天。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Therese laughed. She heard the soft snap of Carol's scarf end in the wind. "We might not be living together, but it'll be the same."</div>

<div class="line_en">It was something like the morning in Waterloo, Therese thought, a time too absolute and flawless to seem real, though it was real, not merely props in a play -- their brandy glasses on the mantel, the row of deers' horns above, Carol's cigarette lighter, the fire itself. But at moments she felt like an actor, remembered only now and then her identity with a sense of surprise, as if she had been playing in these last days the part of someone else, someone fabulously and excessively lucky. She looked up at the fir branches fixed in the rafters, at the man and woman talking inaudibly together at a table against the wall, at the man alone at his table, smoking his cigarette slowly. She thought of the man sitting with the newspaper in the hotel in Waterloo. Didn't he have the same colorless eyes and the long creases on either side of his mouth? Or was it only that this moment of consciousness was so much the same as that other moment?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特芮丝想，此刻就像那天早晨在滑铁卢的感觉，那段时光太纯粹、太完美了，尽管真实存在过，但是想起来又好像不太真实；这段时光，不只是戏剧里的道具而已，不只是她们放在壁炉架上的白兰地酒杯，上面还有一排鹿角，还有卡罗尔的打火机和火。有时她真觉得自己像个演员，只不过偶尔惊讶地想起自己的身份，仿佛这阵子以来她一直在扮演其他人的角色，一个太幸运、太让人难以置信的角色。她抬头往上看，看见固定在屋顶椽子上面的冷杉枝条，看着一对男女在靠墙的桌子那边，用听不见的声音谈话，看着独坐在另一张桌子旁的男人，慢慢地抽着烟。她想到滑铁卢饭店里拿着报纸坐着的男人，他不是也有着同样无神的眼睛，嘴角两侧也同样有长长的皱痕吗？">查看中文翻译</div>
