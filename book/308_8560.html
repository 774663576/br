<div class="line_en">It was a very uncomfortable minute for me. I hardly took in what happened next, but there were exclamations and cries of surprise! When I was sufficiently master of myself to be able to realize what was going on, Ralph Paton was standing by his wife, her hand in his, and he was smiling across the room at me.</div>

<div class="line_en">"One day, you remember, we held a little seance about a table -- just the six of us. I accused the other five persons present of concealing something from me. Four of them gave up their secret. Dr Sheppard did not give up his. But all along I have had my suspicions. Dr Sheppard went to the Three Boars that night hoping to find Ralph. He did not find him there; but supposing, I said to myself, that he met him in the street on his way home? Dr Sheppard was a friend of Captain Paton's, and he had come straight from the scene of the crime. He must know that things looked very black against him. Perhaps he knew more than the general public did --"</div>

<div class="line_en">I hesitated, and Ralph filled up the gap. "To do a bunk," he said graphically. "You see, Ursula left me to go back to the house. I thought it possible that she might have attempted to have another interview with my stepfather. He had already been very rude to her that afternoon. It occurred to me that he might have so insulted her -- in such an unforgivable manner -- that without knowing what she was doing ". He stopped. Ursula released her hand from his, and stepped back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我踌躇着该不该往下说，但拉尔夫替我说完了：“不惜一切代价也要当无耻的逃兵。”他说得倒很形象，“是这样，厄休拉和我分开后就回屋了，我心想她有可能再找继父求情，而那天下午他非常粗暴地对待过她。我突然想到，如果他说话还是那么难听——她也许会一时失去理智——”他停住了，厄休拉迅速抽出手，后退一步。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I did," I said ruefully. "I suppose I might as well make a clean breast of things now. I went to see Ralph that afternoon. At first he refused to take me into his confidence, but later he told me about his marriage, and the hole he was in. As soon as the murder was discovered, I realized that once the facts were known, suspicion could not fail to attach to Ralph -- or, if not to him, to the girl he loved. That night I put the facts plainly before him. The thought of having possibly to give evidence which might incriminate his wife made him resolve at all costs to -- to --"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没错，”我垂头丧气，“看来我还是全招了吧。那天下午我去找拉尔夫，一开始他仍然心存戒备，但很快就向我透露了他的婚事和所面临的困境。谋杀案发后，我便意识到一旦拉尔夫的秘密曝光，人们肯定会怀疑——即便怀疑的对象不是他，也会是他所爱的女人。那天晚上我为他剖析利害，他一想到如果自证清白，罪责便有可能落到妻子头上，就决定不惜一切代价也要——也要——”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You thought that, Ralph! You actually thought that I might have done it?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你居然这么想，拉尔夫！你真以为我是凶手？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Ah, no, indeed," said Poirot. "You should ask yourself the question that I did. If the good doctor is concealing the young man, what place would he choose? It must necessarily be somewhere near at hand. I think ofCranchester. A hotel? No. Lodgings? Even more emphatically, no. Where, then? Ah! I have it. A nursing home. A home for the mentally unfit. I test my theory. I invent a nephew with mental trouble. I consult Mademoiselle Sheppard as to suitable homes. She gives me the names of two near Cranchester to which her brother has sent patients. I make inquiries. Yes, at one of them a patient was brought there by the doctor himself early on Saturday morning. That patient, though known by another name, I had no difficulty in identifying as Captain Paton. After certain necessary formalities, I was allowed to bring him away. He arrived at my house in the early hours of yesterday morning."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“啊，当然不是。”波洛说，“你应该学学我，好好问问自己：如果善良的医生要把那小子藏起来，会选择什么地方？肯定要在附近才行。我想到了克兰切斯特。旅馆？不会。公寓？更不可能。那么会是哪里？啊！我灵机一动，想到了答案：藏进一家疗养院，一家为精神病人开设的疗养院。于是我着手验证这一结论，谎称我有个患精神病的侄儿，请谢泼德小姐推荐合适的安置之处。她给了我克兰切斯特附近两家精神病院的名字，都是她弟弟曾经送病人去过的地方。我进一步调查，果然，其中一家就有一名病人，是星期六早上谢泼德医生亲自送去的。虽然这名病人用了化名，我仍然轻易认出他是佩顿上尉。办理了一些必要的手续之后，院方就允许我带他出院了。昨天清早他刚住进我家。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Let us get back to the culpable conduct of Dr Sheppard," said Poirot drily. "Dr Sheppard consented to do what he could to help him. He was successful in hiding Captain Paton from the police."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Dr Sheppard has been very loyal," said Ralph. "He has stood by me through thick and thin. He did what he thought was best. I see now, from what M. Poirot has told me, that it was not really the best. I should have come forward and faced the music. You see, in the home, we never saw a newspaper. I knew nothing of what was going on."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“谢泼德医生不愧是最忠实的朋友，”拉尔夫说，“他毫无保留地支持我，处处为我着想。经过波洛先生的点拨，我才明白藏起来并不是最好的办法。我应当面对现实，挺身而出。大家知道，在疗养院里没有报纸，我根本不知道后来又发生了这么多事。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You see now why I drew attention to the reticence of your manuscript," murmured Poirot. "It was strictly truthful as far as it went -- but it did not go very far, eh, my friend?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"You know it already," said Ralph. "There's very little for me to all. I left the summer-house about nine forty-five, and tramped about the lanes, trying to make up my mind as to what to do next -- what line to take. I'm bound to admit that I've not the shadow of an alibi, but I give you my solemn word that I never went to the study, that I never saw my stepfather alive -- or dead. Whatever the world thinks, I'd like all of you to believe me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“其实大家都知道了，”拉尔夫说，“也不必再补充什么。我大约九点四十五分离开凉亭，在小径上徘徊了一阵，盘算着接下来该怎么办。我承认，我并没有不在场证明，但我可以对天发誓，我从头到尾都没去过书房，根本没看见我继父是生是死。我不在乎别人怎么看，只希望在场的诸位能相信我。”">查看中文翻译</div>
