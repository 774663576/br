<div class="line_en">A thousand ships!" The little queen's brown hair was tousled and uncombed, and the torchlight made her cheeks look flushed, as if she had just come from some man's embrace. "Your Grace, this must be answered fiercely!" Her last word rang off the rafters and echoed through the cavernous throne room.</div>

<div class="line_en">Seated on her gold-and-crimson high seat beneath the Iron Throne, Cersei could feel a growing tightness in her neck. Must, she thought. She dares say "must" to me.

<div class="line_cn" title="“我们新造的大帆船呢？”哈瑞斯爵士狐疑地问，“铁民的长船无法与大帆船相提并论，没错吧？记得劳勃国王之锤号是维斯特洛最雄伟的战舰…”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"She was," said Waters. "Sweet Cersei will be her equal, once complete, and Lord Tywin will be twice the size of either. Only half are fitted out, however, and none is fully crewed. Even when they are, the numbers would be greatly against us. The common longship is small compared to our galleys, this is true, but the ironmen have larger ships as well. Lord Balon's Great Kraken and the warships of the Iron Fleet were made for battle, not for raids. They are the equal of our lesser war galleys in speed and strength, and most are better crewed and captained. The ironmen live their whole lives at sea."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“她当然是，”维水承认，“甜蜜瑟曦号也不逊色，而泰温公爵号一旦建成，其尺寸等于前两者相加。不过大帆船迄今只完成了一半，船员也未齐备。就算他们做好了准备，数量差距也太过悬殊。海战中，普通长船无法与战舰抗衡，但别忘了，敌人也有大船。巴隆大王的泓洋巨怪号与铁岛舰队中的若干舰只是专冂设计用来制海非为劫掠的，在速度和力量上，他们都可同我方较小的划桨战舰匹敌，而水手和船长两方面又更为精良。毕竟，铁民们一生都在海上讨生活。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“乌鸦会在尸体和垂死人畜身上展开盛宴，”派席尔国师道，“但不敢来打搅健康人。这位攸伦大王将肆意掠夺金银财宝，但等我们出兵，自会返回派克，从前的达衮大王也是如此。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Robert should have scoured the isles after Balon Greyjoy rose against him, Cersei thought. He smashed their fleet, burned their towns, and broke their castles, but when he had them on their knees he let them up again. He should have made another island of their skulls. That was what her father would have done, but Robert never had the stomach that a king requires if he hopes to keep peace in the realm. "The ironmen have not dared raid the Reach since Dagon Greyjoy sat the Seastone Chair," she said. "Why would they do so now? What has emboldened them?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Willas, Cersei thought, the cripple. He is to blame for this. That oaf Mace Tyrell left the defense of the Reach in the hands of a hapless weakling. "It is a long voyage from the Iron Isles to the Shields," she pointed out. "How could a thousand ships come all that way without being seen?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="维拉斯，瑟曦心想，那个残废。全是他的错。呆子梅斯提利尔把河湾地的防务交给一个不能胜任的废物。“从铁群岛到盾牌列岛行程漫长，”她指出，“一千条长船怎么可能神不知鬼不觉地出现呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Willas believes that they did not follow the coast," said Margaery. "They made the voyage out of sight of land, sailing far out into the Sunset Sea and swooping back in from the west."</div>

<div class="line_en">More like the cripple did not have his watchtowers manned, and now he fears to have us know it. The little queen is making excuses for her brother. Cersei's mouth was dry. I need a cup of Arbor gold. If the ironmen decided to take the Arbor next, the whole realm might soon be going thirsty. "Stannis may have had a hand in this. Balon Greyjoy offered my lord father an alliance. Perhaps his son has offered one to Stannis."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="多半是残废没安排好海岸的瞭望措施，事到临头便如此搪塞，而小王后在为自己的哥哥开脱吧。想到这里，瑟曦不由得嘴唇一阵干涩，我喜欢青亭岛的金色葡萄酒，假如铁民们下一个目标是青亭岛，全国上下很快都会口渴的。“史坦尼斯一定与此有关联，巴隆·葛雷乔伊曾向我父亲提出结盟，或许他弟弟转向史坦尼斯…”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"The northmen will not have him," said Cersei, wondering how such a learned man could be so stupid. "Lord Manderly hacked the head and hands off the onion knight, we have that from the Freys, and half a dozen other northern lords have rallied to Lord Bolton. The enemy of my enemy is my friend. Where else can Stannis turn, but to the ironmen and the wildlings, the enemies of the north? But if he thinks that I am going to walk into his trap, he is a bigger fool than you." She turned back to the little queen. "The Shield Islands belong to the Reach. Grimm and Serry and the rest are sworn to Highgarden. It is for Highgarden to answer this."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这说明北方人不上他的当，”瑟曦打断道，她闹不明白，一个学识渊博的老人怎么可能如此愚蠢。“瞧，曼德勒大人砍了洋葱骑士的头和手，有佛雷家人亲眼为证，而其他五六个北方诸侯业已倒向波顿大人。敌人的敌人就是朋友。史坦尼斯不寻求铁民和野人——北方人的两大夙敌——的帮助，他还能找谁呢？不过，他若是以为我会踏进他设下的陷阱，那他可真是蠢到家了。”太后转向小王后。“盾牌列岛位于河湾地，格林、西瑞等人都是向高庭宣誓效忠的封臣，迎击侵略自是高庭分内之事。”">查看中文翻译</div>

Her oldest memories were of sharing a bed with Jaime, when they had still been so young that no one could tell the two of them apart.

None had pleased her, and few lasted very long. Little sneaks, the lot of them. Vapid, weepy creatures, always telling tales and trying to worm their way between me and Jaime.

The wrong man came back from the Trident, the queen would sometimes think as he was plowing her.

"It was not me, my lady," he said in a sulky sullen tone, like a child caught stealing apple cakes from the kitchen. "It was the wine. I drink too much wine." To wash down his admission, he reached for his horn of ale. As he raised it to his mouth, she smashed her own horn in his face, so hard she chipped a tooth.
