<div class="line_en">When Quasimodo saw that the cell was empty, that the gypsy was no longer there, that while he had been defending her she had been abducted, he grasped his hair with both hands and stamped with surprise and pain; then he set out to run through the entire church seeking his Bohemian, howling strange cries to all the corners of the walls, strewing his red hair on the pavement. It was just at the moment when the king's archers were making their victorious entrance into Notre-Dame, also in search of the gypsy. Quasimodo, poor, deaf fellow, aided them in their fatal intentions, without suspecting it; he thought that the outcasts were the gypsy's enemies. He himself conducted Tristan l'Hermite to all possible hiding-places, opened to him the secret doors, the double bottoms of the altars, the rear sacristries. If the unfortunate girl had still been there, it would have been he himself who would have delivered her up.</div>

<div class="line_en">When the fatigue of finding nothing had disheartened Tristan, who was not easily discouraged, Quasimodo continued the search alone. He made the tour of the church twenty times, length and breadth, up and down, ascending and descending, running, calling, shouting, peeping, rummaging, ransacking, thrusting his head into every hole, pushing a torch under every vault, despairing, mad. A male who has lost his female is no more roaring nor more haggard.</div>

<div class="line_en">As he approached it, he fancied that he might, perhaps, find her there. When, at the turn of the gallery which opens on the roof of the side aisles, he perceived the tiny cell with its little window and its little door crouching beneath a great flying buttress like a bird's nest under a branch, the poor man's heart failed him, and he leaned against a pillar to keep from falling. He imagined that she might have returned thither, that some good genius had, no doubt, brought her back, that this chamber was too tranquil, too safe, too charming for her not to be there, and he dared not take another step for fear of destroying his illusion. "Yes," he said to himself, "perchance she is sleeping, or praying. I must not disturb her."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="走近前去，他一边想象着也许即将看见她又在室内。他拐过俯临下层屋顶的走道，瞥见那窄小的幽室，小窗、小门依然如故，蜷缩在一道大扶壁拱架下，像一个鸟窝挂在树枝下。可怜的人见了，他的心脏都停止了跳动，靠在一根柱子上，才没有倒下。他想象，也许她已经回来，也许有什么好天使把她送了回来，这间小室这样幽静、这样安全、这样可爱，她怎能不在里面呢？他生怕打破了自己的迷梦，再也不敢前行一步。——“是的，”他心中暗想：“她大概在睡觉，或者在祈祷。别打扰她吧！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At last when he was sure, perfectly sure that she was no longer there, that all was at an end, that she had been snatched from him, he slowly mounted the staircase to the towers, that staircase which he had ascended with so much eagerness and triumph on the day when he had saved her. He passed those same places once more with drooping head, voiceless, tearless, almost breathless. The church was again deserted, and had fallen back into its silence. The archers had quitted it to track the sorceress in the city. Quasimodo, left alone in that vast Notre-Dame, so besieged and tumultuous but a short time before, once more betook himself to the cell where the gypsy had slept for so many weeks under his guardianship.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="终于，他明白过来，深信她已经不在，一切全完了，她被人偷走了。他缓缓走上钟楼的楼梯。就是这楼梯，他搭救她的那天他曾得意洋洋，欣喜若狂，攀登上来。现在他又经过同一地点，搭拉着脑袋，没有声音，没有眼泪，几乎连呼吸也没有。主教堂里再次不见人影，重新坠入往常的寂静。弓手已经离去，前往内城追捕女巫。广阔的圣母院刚才还遭受猛烈围攻，那样惊扰喧闹，现在只有卡席莫多一人留在那里。他再次前往埃及姑娘在他警卫下睡了许多天的那间小室。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When he recovered his senses, he threw himself on the bed and rolling about, he kissed frantically the place where the young girl had slept and which was still warm; he remained there for several moments as motionless as though he were about to expire; then he rose, dripping with perspiration, panting, mad, and began to beat his head against the wall with the frightful regularity of the clapper of his bells, and the resolution of a man determined to kill himself. At length he fell a second time, exhausted; he dragged himself on his knees outside the cell, and crouched down facing the door, in an attitude of astonishment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他苏醒以后，扑倒在床铺上打滚，狂热地吻着姑娘睡过的仍然温暖的地方，躺着不动好几分钟，仿佛就要咽气了。然后，他又跳起来，满头大汗，喘着粗气，疯了似的，把头使劲往墙上撞，一下下像他敲钟似的有规律，这样的决心正是要把头颅撞碎。终于，他精疲力竭，再次倒在地上。他四肢着地，爬出室外，在房门对面蹲伏着，惊讶万分。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At length he summoned up courage, advanced on tiptoe, looked, entered. Empty. The cell was still empty. The unhappy deaf man walked slowly round it, lifted the bed and looked beneath it, as though she might be concealed between the pavement and the mattress, then he shook his head and remained stupefied. All at once, he crushed his torch under his foot, and, without uttering a word, without giving vent to a sigh, he flung himself at full speed, head foremost against the wall, and fell fainting on the floor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="终于，他鼓起勇气，踮起脚尖又向前走，看了看，走了进去。还是空无人影！小室里始终是空的。不幸的聋子慢慢地在屋里转圈，又掀起地铺，向下面张望，仿佛她能够藏在石板和褥子之间似的。随即，他摇摇头，呆立不动。忽然，他狂怒地一脚踩熄火把，一声不吭，一声叹息也没有，全速奔跑，用头向墙上撞去，晕倒在石板地上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He remained thus for more than an hour without making a movement, with his eye fixed on the deserted cell, more gloomy, and more pensive than a mother seated between an empty cradle and a full coffin. He uttered not a word; only at long intervals, a sob heaved his body violently, but it was a tearless sob, like summer lightning which makes no noise.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就这样待了一个多钟头，一动也不动，眼睛始终盯着人去室空的小屋，他脸色阴沉，沉思着，忧伤赛过坐在空了的摇篮和装了的棺材之间的母亲。他一声不吭，只是，间隔很久有一声啜泣强烈震撼他的全身，然而，这是无泪的呜咽，恰似夏天的闪电那样没有声音。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It appears to have been then, that, seeking at the bottom of his lonely thoughts for the unexpected abductor of the gypsy, he thought of the archdeacon. He remembered that Dom Claude alone possessed a key to the staircase leading to the cell; he recalled his nocturnal attempts on the young girl, in the first of which he, Quasimodo, had assisted, the second of which he had prevented. He recalled a thousand details, and soon he no longer doubted that the archdeacon had taken the gypsy. Nevertheless, such was his respect for the priest, such his gratitude, his devotion, his love for this man had taken such deep root in his heart, that they resisted, even at this moment, the talons of jealousy and despair.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="看来，正是在这时，当他悲痛地遍索想象，想要探究出可能是谁这样猝不及防地抢走了埃及姑娘的时候，他想到了副主教。他想起了：只有堂克洛德有通向小室的楼梯门上的钥匙；他又想起了：堂克洛德曾经两次在夜里对姑娘欲行非礼，头一次卡席莫多自己给了他协助，第二次他加以制止了。他回想到许许多多细节，顿时他再也不怀疑是副主教把埃及姑娘劫走了！然而，他对教士是那样尊敬，对这个人又是那样感恩戴德、竭尽忠诚、无比敬爱，心中这种种感情根深蒂固，即使这时，也抗拒着绝望嫉妒的侵袭。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Claude was walking with a slow, grave step. He did not look before him as he walked, he was directing his course towards the northern tower, but his face was turned aside towards the right bank of the Seine, and he held his head high, as though trying to see something over the roofs. The owl often assumes this oblique attitude. It flies towards one point and looks towards another. In this manner the priest passed above Quasimodo without seeing him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克洛德以庄重的步伐缓缓走着。他走着，眼睛并不看前面。他是向北钟楼走去的，可是他的脸扭向一旁，朝着塞纳河右岸，他还高高扬着头，好像他是想越过屋顶看见什么东西。猫头鹰常有这种阴险的姿态：飞向某一点，眼睛却瞅着另一点。教士就这样从卡席莫多头顶上走过去，没有看见他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At the moment when his thought was thus fixed upon the priest, while the daybreak was whitening the flying buttresses, he perceived on the highest story of Notre-Dame, at the angle formed by the external balustrade as it makes the turn of the chancel, a figure walking. This figure was coming towards him. He recognized it. It was the archdeacon.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的思想就这样集中到教士身上，这时扶壁拱架上泛起鱼肚色曙光。他瞥见圣母院顶层，环绕东圆室的外面栏杆的拐角那里，有个人影在走动。这个人影向他这边走来。他认出了：正是副主教。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He reflected that the archdeacon had done this thing, and the wrath of blood and death which it would have evoked in him against any other person, turned in the poor deaf man, from the moment when Claude Frollo was in question, into an increase of grief and sorrow.</div>

<div class="line_en">When he reached the summit of the tower, before emerging from the shadow of the staircase and stepping upon the platform, he cautiously examined the position of the priest. The priest's back was turned to him. There is an openwork balustrade which surrounds the platform of the bell tower. The priest, whose eyes looked down upon the town, was resting his breast on that one of the four sides of the balustrades which looks upon the Pont Notre-Dame.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当他到达钟楼顶上，还没有从阴影里出来，走上平台的时候，他先小心翼翼地看了看教士在哪里。教士是背向着他的。钟楼平台四面环绕着一道透空雕琢的栏杆。教士把胸脯伏在朝向圣母院桥的那面栏杆上，眼睛向外城眺望。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The deaf man, who had been petrified by this sudden apparition, beheld him disappear through the door of the staircase to the north tower. The reader is aware that this is the tower from which the Hôtel-de-Ville is visible. Quasimodo rose and followed the archdeacon.</div>

<div class="line_en">Paris is a magnificent and charming spectacle, and especially at that day, viewed from the top of the towers of Notre-Dame, in the fresh light of a summer dawn. The day might have been in July. The sky was perfectly serene. Some tardy stars were fading away at various points, and there was a very brilliant one in the east, in the brightest part of the heavens. The sun was about to appear; Paris was beginning to move. A very white and very pure light brought out vividly to the eye all the outlines that its thousands of houses present to the east. The giant shadow of the towers leaped from roof to roof, from one end of the great city to the other. There were several quarters from which were already heard voices and noisy sounds. Here the stroke of a bell, there the stroke of a hammer, beyond, the complicated clatter of a cart in motion.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="巴黎，尤其是当时的巴黎，浸沉于夏季黎明的清新晨曦之中，从圣母院钟楼顶上眺望，真是绚丽多彩的动人美景。这天可能是七月里。天空晴朗异常。稀稀落落有几颗残星渐渐消隐，东方有一颗特别明亮，恰恰在最透亮的天际。朝阳方待升起。巴黎开始有了动静。十分纯净、十分洁白的晨曦辉映之下，东边千千万万幢房屋更加烘托出鲜明的各色各样的轮廓。圣母院钟楼庞大阴影，从巨大城市的一端到另一端，逐个屋顶移动。已经有些地段开始有了说话声，发出了声响。这里听见一声钟鸣，那里听见一声锤击，再过去又听见车行辚辚错综复杂的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Already several columns of smoke were being belched forth from the chimneys scattered over the whole surface of roofs, as through the fissures of an immense sulphurous crater. The river, which ruffles its waters against the arches of so many bridges, against the points of so many islands, was wavering with silvery folds. Around the city, outside the ramparts, sight was lost in a great circle of fleecy vapors through which one confusedly distinguished the indefinite line of the plains, and the graceful swell of the heights. All sorts of floating sounds were dispersed over this half-awakened city. Towards the east, the morning breeze chased a few soft white bits of wool torn from the misty fleece of the hills.</div>

This was all that remained of the tempest of the night. The bonfire lighted between the towers by Quasimodo had died out. Tristan had already cleared up the Place, and had the dead thrown into the Seine. Kings like Louis XI. are careful to clean the pavement quickly after a massacre.</div>

<div class="line_en">Quasimodo was burning to ask him what he had done with the gypsy; but the archdeacon seemed to be out of the world at that moment. He was evidently in one of those violent moments of life when one would not feel the earth crumble. He remained motionless and silent, with his eyes steadily fixed on a certain point; and there was something so terrible about this silence and immobility that the savage bellringer shuddered before it and dared not come in contact with it. Only, and this was also one way of interrogating the archdeacon, he followed the direction of his vision, and in this way the glance of the unhappy deaf man fell upon the Place de Grève.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡席莫多急于想询问他把埃及姑娘怎样处置了。可是，副主教此刻似乎已经魂飞天外。显然，他正处于这样的生命激烈动荡的时刻：即使天崩地裂，他也不会觉察。他双目紧紧死盯着某个地点，始终静止沉默，这种静止沉默中却有某种令人恐惧的东西，即使狂野的敲钟人见了也不寒而栗，不敢贸然冲撞。卡席莫多只能顺着他的视线看去（其实这也是询问的一种方式），于是，不幸的聋子的目光就落到了河滩广场上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">All at once the man kicked away the ladder abruptly, and Quasimodo, who had not breathed for several moments, beheld the unhappy child dangling at the end of the rope two fathoms above the pavement, with the man squatting on her shoulders. The rope made several gyrations on itself, and Quasimodo beheld horrible convulsions run along the gypsy's body. The priest, on his side, with outstretched neck and eyes starting from his head, contemplated this horrible group of the man and the young girl,-- the spider and the fly.</div>

<div class="line_en">In this terrible situation, the archdeacon said not a word, uttered not a groan. He merely writhed upon the spout, with incredible efforts to climb up again; but his hands had no hold on the granite, his feet slid along the blackened wall without catching fast. People who have ascended the towers of Notre-Dame know that there is a swell of the stone immediately beneath the balustrade. It was on this retreating angle that miserable archdeacon exhausted himself. He had not to deal with a perpendicular wall, but with one which sloped away beneath him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽然处境是这样可怕，副主教一言不发，也不呻吟。他只是吊住水槽扭曲着身子，作出超人的努力，想重新爬上去。可是，那花岗石上双手无处把握，他用两脚在黑暗的墙壁上划出一道道印子，然而也无处生根。登上过圣母院钟楼的人都知道：就在顶层栏杆下面石墙恰恰凹了进去。就是在这后缩的角度上挣扎，可怜的副主教耗尽着精力。他要对付的并不是陡立的墙壁，而是在他脚下遁去的墙壁。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The deaf man was leaning, with his elbows on the balustrade, at the spot where the archdeacon had been a moment before, and there, never detaching his gaze from the only object which existed for him in the world at that moment, he remained motionless and mute, like a man struck by lightning, and a long stream of tears flowed in silence from that eye which, up to that time, had never shed but one tear.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="聋子俯身在栏杆上，就在副主教刚才站的地方，目不转睛始终看着他此刻在世界上唯一的目标。他一动也不动，哑口无言，就像一个遭天雷劈了的人。他那只独眼从来没有落过一滴眼泪，这时泪珠儿默默地滚滚而下。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He heard his cassock, which was caught on the spout, crack and rip at every jerk that he gave it. To complete his misfortune, this spout ended in a leaden pipe which bent under the weight of his body. The archdeacon felt this pipe slowly giving way. The miserable man said to himself that, when his hands should be worn out with fatigue, when his cassock should tear asunder, when the lead should give way, he would be obliged to fall, and terror seized upon his very vitals. Now and then he glanced wildly at a sort of narrow shelf formed, ten feet lower down, by projections of the sculpture, and he prayed heaven, from the depths of his distressed soul, that he might be allowed to finish his life, were it to last two centuries, on that space two feet square. Once, he glanced below him into the Place, into the abyss; the head which he raised again had its eyes closed and its hair standing erect.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他听见挂在水槽上的教士服，随着自己每一挣扎，撕裂声直响。更为倒霉的是：这道承溜的末梢是一根铅管，在他身体重量下渐渐弯了下去。副主教感到这根铅管慢慢下垂。这不幸的人心想：一旦双手疲惫无力，一旦教士服撕裂，一旦铅管垂落，他一定会掉下去。恐惧使他胆肝俱裂。几次，他失魂落魄看看身下十尺左右，由于雕塑凸凹不平而形成的一小方平台，他在悲凄的灵魂深处乞求上苍，让他在这二尺见方的平台上了此残生，即使他还可以活上一百年。还有一次，他看看身下的广场，那深渊；他赶紧抬起头来，双目紧闭，头发也直立起来了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The archdeacon, seeing that all his exertions served only to weaken the fragile support which remained to him, decided to remain quiet. There he hung, embracing the gutter, hardly breathing, no longer stirring, making no longer any other movements than that mechanical convulsion of the stomach, which one experiences in dreams when one fancies himself falling. His fixed eyes were wide open with a stare. He lost ground little by little, nevertheless, his fingers slipped along the spout; he became more and more conscious of the feebleness of his arms and the weight of his body. The curve of the lead which sustained him inclined more and more each instant towards the abyss.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="副主教看见自己每一用力只是使那唯一的脆弱支点摇晃得更加厉害，就下了决心不再挣扎。他悬吊在那里，搂抱着水槽，简直没有呼吸，不再动弹，身体没有其他的动作，只是腹部还有机械的痉挛，就像一个人在睡梦中觉得自己往下坠落时那样。死滞的眼睛病态地以惊讶的神态大睁着。然而，渐渐，他失去了把握，指头在水槽上滑下去，他越来越感到双臂没有了力气，身体越来越重，支持着他的铅管每分每秒一点点一点点越来越向深渊弯曲下去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He beheld below him, a frightful thing, the roof of Saint-Jean le Rond, as small as a card folded in two. He gazed at the impressive carvings, one by one, of the tower, suspended like himself over the precipice, but without terror for themselves or pity for him. All was stone around him; before his eyes, gaping monsters; below, quite at the bottom, in the Place, the pavement; above his head, Quasimodo weeping.</div>

<div class="line_en">At last the archdeacon, foaming with rage and despair, understood that all was in vain. Nevertheless, he collected all the strength which remained to him for a final effort. He stiffened himself upon the spout, pushed against the wall with both his knees, clung to a crevice in the stones with his hands, and succeeded in climbing back with one foot, perhaps; but this effort made the leaden beak on which he rested bend abruptly. His cassock burst open at the same time. Then, feeling everything give way beneath him, with nothing but his stiffened and failing hands to support him, the unfortunate man closed his eyes and let go of the spout. He fell.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="副主教不胜愤恨，也不胜恐惧，终于明白了一切都没有用。然而，他还是拼其余力，作一次最后的努力。他悬吊着水槽挺直身子，双膝猛一推墙，双手使劲抠住石头的一道夹缝，总算向上攀缘了大约一尺。但是，这样猛一挣扎，使得支撑他的铅管猝然向下一弯，同时，教士服也完全裂开了。于是，他感到身下失却了任何依托，只有僵直的、力气渐渐耗尽的双手好像还在抓着什么，不幸人闭上两眼，松开水槽，掉了下去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the Parvis there were several groups of curious good people, who were tranquilly seeking to divine who the madman could be who was amusing himself in so strange a manner.

<div class="line_en">A fall from such a height is seldom perpendicular. The archdeacon, launched into space, fell at first head foremost, with outspread hands; then he whirled over and over many times; the wind blew him upon the roof of a house, where the unfortunate man began to break up. Nevertheless, he was not dead when he reached there. The bellringer saw him still endeavor to cling to a gable with his nails; but the surface sloped too much, and he had no more strength. He slid rapidly along the roof like a loosened tile, and dashed upon the pavement. There he no longer moved.</div>
