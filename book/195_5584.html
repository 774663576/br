<div class="line_en">Philip awoke with a start next morning, conscious that it was late, and looking at his watch found it was nine o'clock. He jumped out of bed and went into the kitchen to get himself some hot water to shave with. There was no sign of Mildred, and the things which she had used for her supper the night before still lay in the sink unwashed. He knocked at her door.</div>

<div class="line_en">She did not answer, even after a second louder knocking, and he concluded that she was sulking. He was in too great a hurry to bother about that. He put some water on to boil and jumped into his bath which was always poured out the night before in order to take the chill off. He presumed that Mildred would cook his breakfast while he was dressing and leave it in the sitting-room. She had done that two or three times when she was out of temper. But he heard no sound of her moving, and realised that if he wanted anything to eat he would have to get it himself. He was irritated that she should play him such a trick on a morning when he had over-slept himself. There was still no sign of her when he was ready, but he heard her moving about her room. She was evidently getting up. He made himself some tea and cut himself a couple of pieces of bread and butter, which he ate while he was putting on his boots, then bolted downstairs and along the street into the main road to catch his tram. While his eyes sought out the newspaper shops to see the war news on the placards, he thought of the scene of the night before: now that it was over and he had slept on it, he could not help thinking it grotesque; he supposed he had been ridiculous, but he was not master of his feelings; at the time they had been overwhelming. He was angry with Mildred because she had forced him into that absurd position, and then with renewed astonishment he thought of her outburst and the filthy language she had used. He could not help flushing when he remembered her final jibe; but he shrugged his shoulders contemptuously. He had long known that when his fellows were angry with him they never failed to taunt him with his deformity. He had seen men at the hospital imitate his walk, not before him as they used at school, but when they thought he was not looking. He knew now that they did it from no wilful unkindness, but because man is naturally an imitative animal, and because it was an easy way to make people laugh: he knew it, but he could never resign himself to it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="屋里没有声音，他又使劲敲了两下，还是没人应声。大概她还在生闷气吧。他急着走，没时间操心哄她。他把水烧上，跳进澡盆子里。澡盆的水是昨晚就打好的，经过一晚上已经不太凉了。他心想，等自己洗完澡穿上衣服，米尔德里德就应该把饭烧好，摆在客厅了。之前两人闹别扭的时候，她就是这么做的。可这次他竖着耳朵却怎么也听不到她起床的动静，看来要想吃上早饭就必须得自己做了吧。他很生气，本来早上就起晚了，她还非要这么捉弄他。等他收拾停当，还是没见她出屋，但能听到她在卧室里走来走去的声音。她肯定起床了。他泡了点茶，切了块面包和黄油，一边穿靴子一边大口塞到肚里，然后飞奔下楼，冲到街上赶去医院的电车。他的眼睛扫读着报纸上刊登的战争新闻，心里却不由想起昨晚和米尔德里德的争吵。事情已经过去，他也不再继续惦念了，可不禁觉得这场争吵实在太荒唐。他知道自己的行为特别可笑，但没办法，如果他就是不想做，总没法子强迫自己。昨晚的确是火气上头，没法控制了。他恨米尔德里德，因为正是她把他逼到了如此滑稽可笑的境地，那些从她嘴里吐出的污言秽语让他大跌眼镜，连做梦也想不到她会说出这样难听的话。当他回忆起她进屋之前最后的那句嘲讽时，脸不由烧红了，轻蔑地耸了耸肩膀。他早就习惯了别人和他吵架时总是奚落他的残疾，还曾经见过医院里的同事模仿他走路。过去在学校，同学都是当面嘲笑他，现在工作了，身边人又都背着他模仿他一瘸一拐的样子。他现在知道这些人可能并无恶意。人本来就是一种爱模仿的动物，况且想逗人发笑，这是个非常简便的法子。他什么道理都懂，可身在其中终究不能泰然处之。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Laughing, he went to the first of his cases, a boy with tuberculous ulcers, and removed his bandages. The boy was pleased to see him, and Philip chaffed him as he put a clean dressing on the wound. Philip was a favourite with the patients; he treated them good-humouredly; and he had gentle, sensitive hands which did not hurt them: some of the dressers were a little rough and happy-go-lucky in their methods. He lunched with his friends in the club-room, a frugal meal consisting of a scone and butter, with a cup of cocoa, and they talked of the war. Several men were going out, but the authorities were particular and refused everyone who had not had a hospital appointment. Someone suggested that, if the war went on, in a while they would be glad to take anyone who was qualified; but the general opinion was that it would be over in a month. Now that Roberts was there things would get all right in no time. This was Macalister's opinion too, and he had told Philip that they must watch their chance and buy just before peace was declared. There would be a boom then, and they might all make a bit of money. Philip had left with Macalister instructions to buy him stock whenever the opportunity presented itself. His appetite had been whetted by the thirty pounds he had made in the summer, and he wanted now to make a couple of hundred.</div>

<div class="line_en">He finished his day's work and got on a tram to go back to Kennington. He wondered how Mildred would behave that evening. It was a nuisance to think that she would probably be surly and refuse to answer his questions. It was a warm evening for the time of year, and even in those gray streets of South London there was the languor of February; nature is restless then after the long winter months, growing things awake from their sleep, and there is a rustle in the earth, a forerunner of spring, as it resumes its eternal activities. Philip would have liked to drive on further, it was distasteful to him to go back to his rooms, and he wanted the air; but the desire to see the child clutched suddenly at his heartstrings, and he smiled to himself as he thought of her toddling towards him with a crow of delight. He was surprised, when he reached the house and looked up mechanically at the windows, to see that there was no light. He went upstairs and knocked, but got no answer. When Mildred went out she left the key under the mat and he found it there now. He let himself in and going into the sitting-room struck a match. Something had happened, he did not at once know what; he turned the gas on full and lit it; the room was suddenly filled with the glare and he looked round. He gasped. The whole place was wrecked. Everything in it had been wilfully destroyed. Anger seized him, and he rushed into Mildred's room. It was dark and empty. When he had got a light he saw that she had taken away all her things and the baby's (he had noticed on entering that the go-cart was not in its usual place on the landing, but thought Mildred had taken the baby out;) and all the things on the washing-stand had been broken, a knife had been drawn cross-ways through the seats of the two chairs, the pillow had been slit open, there were large gashes in the sheets and the counterpane, the looking-glass appeared to have been broken with a hammer. Philip was bewildered. He went into his own room, and here too everything was in confusion. The basin and the ewer had been smashed, the looking-glass was in fragments, and the sheets were in ribands. Mildred had made a slit large enough to put her hand into the pillow and had scattered the feathers about the room. She had jabbed a knife into the blankets. On the dressing-table were photographs of Philip's mother, the frames had been smashed and the glass shivered. Philip went into the tiny kitchen. Everything that was breakable was broken, glasses, pudding-basins, plates, dishes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一天的工作结束后，他搭电车回到了肯宁顿。不知道米尔德里德今晚又会闹哪一出。不出意外，迎接他的恐怕还是那张冷冰冰的臭脸和爱答不理的态度。在一年中的这个季节，今晚的天气算是相当暖和了。即使在伦敦南区灰色的街道也弥漫着二月天里懒洋洋的气氛。漫长的寒冬过去了，大自然开始蠢蠢欲动，躁动不安。沉睡着的万物被纷纷唤醒，泥土中传来的“沙沙”声是春日降临的前奏。春天，永恒的春天，终于来到了。菲利普想一直坐在电车上，随它驶到远方去。他不想回家，只想多呼吸几口这清新沁凉的空气。忽然，他的心弦猛地一叩：他想那孩子了。想到她一步三晃，朝自己慢慢走来，他就幸福地绽开笑脸。等快到家门口，他看见窗户黑洞洞的没有一星灯光，心里便咯噔一下。快步上楼，敲了敲门，里面没有声音。米尔德里德外出的时候总会把钥匙放在门垫下，果不其然，钥匙就在那里。他自己开了门，走进客厅，划着一根火柴。当真有事发生，可这会儿他还不清楚发生了什么。他把汽灯开关拧到最大，点上火，屋里一下被照亮了。他四下看了一圈，倒吸一口凉气。只见屋子一片乱七八糟，所有东西都被砸得稀巴烂。他火冒三丈，七窍冒烟，冲进米尔德里德的房间，却发现里面空无一人，漆黑一片。点上灯，才发现她早卷着自己和孩子的行李逃跑了（进门的时候他看楼梯口那里没有婴儿车了，还以为是米尔德里德带孩子出去散步）。脸盆架上的东西被摔得稀碎，椅子的皮座被刀横竖划了几道大口子，枕头扯破了，床单被罩都撕成好几块，梳妆镜被锤子敲成一地碎片。菲利普觉得一阵头晕目眩，又去自己房间看了看，那里是一副惨不忍睹的情况。脸盆和水壶砸在地上，镜子成了一堆碎玻璃，床单扯成一条条的。米尔德里德把枕头捅开个大洞，把羽毛掏出来撒得满屋都是。毯子也被小刀戳破了，梳妆台上摆着的菲利普母亲的照片，也被摔烂了镜框，砸碎了玻璃。菲利普去厨房查看，酒杯、布丁碟、盘子碗儿，只要是能摔的全都被摔得一干二净。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It took Philip's breath away. Mildred had left no letter, nothing but this ruin to mark her anger, and he could imagine the set face with which she had gone about her work. He went back into the sitting-room and looked about him. He was so astonished that he no longer felt angry. He looked curiously at the kitchen-knife and the coal-hammer, which were lying on the table where she had left them. Then his eye caught a large carving-knife in the fireplace which had been broken. It must have taken her a long time to do so much damage. Lawson's portrait of him had been cut cross-ways and gaped hideously. His own drawings had been ripped in pieces; and the photographs, Manet's Olympia and the Odalisque of Ingres, the portrait of Philip IV, had been smashed with great blows of the coal-hammer. There were gashes in the table-cloth and in the curtains and in the two arm-chairs. They were quite ruined. On one wall over the table which Philip used as his desk was the little bit of Persian rug which Cronshaw had given him. Mildred had always hated it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="菲利普又惊又气，差点一口气没喘上来。除了烂摊子，米尔德里德连一封信都没留下。他简直能想象到她又砸又摔的时候那副咬牙切齿的表情。走回客厅，又环顾一番，惊讶地发现自己一肚子的怒火已经消了下去。他好奇地看着她搁在桌上的菜刀和敲煤用的锤头，又看到壁炉里扔着一把已经折断的刻刀。搞了这么大一场破坏，想必也花了她不少时间。劳森给他画的肖像被横七竖八地划开了，咧着骇人的大口子。他的几幅作品也撕成碎片。马奈的《奥林匹亚》、安格尔的《大宫女》和菲利普四世肖像画的照片都被锤头捣得粉碎。甚至连桌布、窗帘和两把扶手椅也都难逃毒手，布满累累刀痕。所有东西都破得不能再用了。书桌上方的墙上挂着克朗肖给他的那块小地毯。米尔德里德一直很讨厌这块毯子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It made her furious because Philip told her it contained the answer to a great riddle. She thought he was making fun of her. She had drawn the knife right through it three times, it must have required some strength, and it hung now in tatters. Philip had two or three blue and white plates, of no value, but he had bought them one by one for very small sums and liked them for their associations. They littered the floor in fragments. There were long gashes on the backs of his books, and she had taken the trouble to tear pages out of the unbound French ones. The little ornaments on the chimney-piece lay on the hearth in bits. Everything that it had been possible to destroy with a knife or a hammer was destroyed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="菲利普跟她解释说，在这块毯子里藏着一个伟大谜语的谜底。她却以为说这话是为了故意耍她，气得头顶冒烟。她用刀子在地毯上狠狠划了三道，看来像是使上了吃奶的劲儿，而这条毯子现在就如同几条破布一样挂在墙上。菲利普有两三件蓝白相间的摆盘，虽然不值什么钱，但却是他用牙缝里挤出的钱一件一件买回来的。他经常盯着这几个盘子出神。而现在，它们变成一摊碎片散了满地。他的书的背面也全是大口子，米尔德里德竟然还不嫌麻烦把没有装订的法文书一页页扯下来。壁炉架上的小摆设都被扔到地上，丢进炉膛。所有能用刀子、斧子破坏掉的东西没有一件还是好的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The whole of Philip's belongings would not have sold for thirty pounds, but most of them were old friends, and he was a domestic creature, attached to all those odds and ends because they were his; he had been proud of his little home, and on so little money had made it pretty and characteristic. He sank down now in despair. He asked himself how she could have been so cruel. A sudden fear got him on his feet again and into the passage, where stood a cupboard in which he kept his clothes. He opened it and gave a sigh of relief. She had apparently forgotten it and none of his things was touched.</div>

<div class="line_en">The only thing now was to leave the rooms, and he made up his mind to give notice the next morning. He could not afford to make good the damage done, and he had so little money left that he must find cheaper lodgings still. He would be glad to get out of them. The expense had worried him, and now the recollection of Mildred would be in them always. Philip was impatient and could never rest till he had put in action the plan which he had in mind; so on the following afternoon he got in a dealer in second-hand furniture who offered him three pounds for all his goods damaged and undamaged; and two days later he moved into the house opposite the hospital in which he had had rooms when first he became a medical student. The landlady was a very decent woman. He took a bed-room at the top, which she let him have for six shillings a week; it was small and shabby and looked on the yard of the house that backed on to it, but he had nothing now except his clothes and a box of books, and he was glad to lodge so cheaply.</div>

<div class="line_en">He went back into the sitting-room and, surveying the scene, wondered what to do; he had not the heart to begin trying to set things straight; besides there was no food in the house, and he was hungry.

A little pang seized him as he thought of the child, and he wondered whether she would miss him, at first perhaps, but in a week she would have forgotten him; and he was thankful to be rid of Mildred. He did not think of her with wrath, but with an overwhelming sense of boredom.</div>
