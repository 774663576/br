<div class="line_en">The more quickly this horror is disposed of the better. The first to emerge from his tree was Curly. He rose out of it into the arms of Cecco, who flung him to Smee, who flung him to Starkey, who flung him to Bill Jukes, who flung him to Noodler, and so he was tossed from one to another till he fell at the feet of the black pirate. All the boys were plucked from their trees in this ruthless manner; and several of them were in the air at a time, like bales of goods flung from hand to hand.</div>

<div class="line_en">A different treatment was accorded to Wendy, who came last. With ironical politeness Hook raised his hat to her, and, offering her his arm, escorted her to the spot where the others were being gagged. He did it with such an air, he was to frightfully DISTINGUE (imposingly distinguished), that she was too fascinated to cry out. She was only a little girl.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后一个出来的是温迪，她受到的待遇略有不同。胡克嘲弄地装作彬彬有礼的样子，对她举了举帽子，用胳臂挽着她，把她搀扶到别的孩子囚禁的地方。胡克的风度是那样高贵，温迪像着了迷似的，竟没有哭出来。她只不过是个小女孩呀。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Perhaps it is tell-tale to divulge that for a moment Hook entranced her, and we tell on her only because her slip led to strange results. Had she haughtily unhanded him (and we should have loved to write it of her), she would have been hurled through the air like the others, and then Hook would probably not have been present at the tying of the children; and had he not been at the tying he would not have discovered Slightly's secret, and without the secret he could not presently have made his foul attempt on Peter's life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="要说胡克这一刻真的迷惑了温迪，似乎是贬低了她，但我们提到这一点，是因为温迪的失误引起了意想不到的后果。要是她拒绝挽着胡克的手臂（我们当然愿意这样来写她），她就会像别的孩子一样被抛在空中；那样，胡克就不会看到孩子们被捆绑的情况；假如他当时不在场，他也就不会发现斯莱特利的秘密；假如没有发现这个秘密，他就不会去卑鄙地图谋彼得的性命。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They were tied to prevent their flying away, doubled up with their knees close to their ears; and for the trussing of them the black pirate had cut a rope into nine equal pieces. All went well until Slightly's turn came, when he was found to be like those irritating parcels that use up all the string in going round and leave no tags (ends) with which to tie a knot. The pirates kicked him in their rage, just as you kick the parcel (though in fairness you should kick the string); and strange to say it was Hook who told them to belay their violence. His lip was curled with malicious triumph. While his dogs were merely sweating because every time they tried to pack the unhappy lad tight in one part he bulged out in another, Hook's master mind had gone far beneath Slightly's surface, probing not for effects but for causes; and his exultation showed that he had found them. Slightly, white to the gills, knew that Hook had surprised (discovered) his secret, which was this, that no boy so blown out could use a tree wherein an average man need stick. Poor Slightly, most wretched of all the children now, for he was in a panic about Peter, bitterly regretted what he had done. Madly addicted to the drinking of water when he was hot, he had swelled in consequence to his present girth, and instead of reducing himself to fit his tree he had, unknown to the others, whittled his tree to make it fit him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="为了防止孩子们逃跑，海盗们把他们捆了起来，膝盖贴近耳朵捆成一团；为了捆绑他们，黑海盗把一根绳子割成相等的九段。全都顺顺当当地捆好了。最后轮到捆斯莱特利，这时，发现他像一个恼人的包裹一样，一道一道用完所有的绳子，剩下的绳子头不够打结了。海盗们恼怒之下就踢他，就像你踢一只包裹一样（说句公道话，你应该踢绳子）；说也奇怪，是胡克叫他们停止暴行。胡克的嘴唇撅起来了，露出恶毒的得意神气。他的部下在捆绑这个不幸的孩子时，每次要捆紧他的这一部分，另一部分就胀出来厂，累得他们汗如雨下。胡克老练的头脑看透了斯莱特利的把戏，他勘察的不是结果，而是原因；他那副洋洋得意的样子说明他已找到了原因。斯莱特利脸发白了，他知道胡克突然发现了他的秘密，这样一个胀大了的孩子能钻得进的树洞，一个普通大人不用棍子捅，也一定能钻进去。可怜的斯莱持利，他现在是所有孩子们中最不幸的一个了，因为他为彼得担惊受伯，深深地懊悔他所做的事。原来，有一次他热极了，拼命喝水，把肚子胀得像现在这样大，他没有使自己缩小去就他的树洞，而是背着人削大了树洞来就他自己。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sufficient of this Hook guessed to persuade him that Peter at last lay at his mercy, but no word of the dark design that now formed in the subterranean caverns of his mind crossed his lips; he merely signed that the captives were to be conveyed to the ship, and that he would be alone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这就够了，胡克相信彼得现在终于落进了他的手心；不过他那阴暗的脑海里形成的这个计谋，一个字也没有从他嘴里吐露出来；他只作了个手势，命令把俘虏押上船去，他要独自留下。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Hook saw it, and it did Peter a bad service. It dried up any trickle of pity for him that may have remained in the pirate's infuriated breast.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="胡克看见了，这对彼得很不利。因为，若是这海盗心里还有一丝恻隐之心，这时也消失得一干二净了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">How to convey them? Hunched up in their ropes they might indeed be rolled down hill like barrels, but most of the way lay through a morass. Again Hook's genius surmounted difficulties. He indicated that the little house must be used as a conveyance. The children were flung into it, four stout pirates raised it on their shoulders, the others fell in behind, and singing the hateful pirate chorus the strange procession set off through the wood. I don't know whether any of the children were crying; if so, the singing drowned the sound; but as the little house disappeared in the forest, a brave though tiny jet of smoke issued from its chimney as if defying Hook.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="怎样押送呢？他们被绳子捆成一团，原是可以像木桶一样滚下山坡的，但是途中要经过一些沼地。又是胡克的天才克服了困难。他指示，可以利用那间小屋子作为运输工具。孩子们被扔进了小屋子，四个强壮的海盗把它扛在肩上，其余的海盗跟在后面，唱起那支可恶的海盗歌。这支奇怪的队伍出发了，穿过了树林。我不知道孩子们是否有人在哭；要是有，那哭声也给歌声淹没了。可是，当小屋于在树林里渐渐隐去时，从它的烟囱里升起了一缕细细的但又是勇敢的青烟，仿佛在向胡克挑战。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was no way of knowing, save by going down. Hook let his cloak slip softly to the ground, and then biting his lips till a lewd blood stood on them, he stepped into the tree. He was a brave man, but for a moment he had to stop there and wipe his brow, which was dripping like a candle. Then, silently, he let himself go into the unknown.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是没法知道的，除非下去。胡克把他的外套轻轻地脱下放在地上，紧紧地咬着嘴唇，直咬得流出了污血，他踏进了树洞。他是个勇敢的人；可是，一时竟不得不停下来擦额上的汗，他的汗像蜡烛油一样直淌。然后，他悄悄地下到这个从来不知道的地方。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The first thing he did on finding himself alone in the fast falling night was to tiptoe to Slightly's tree, and make sure that it provided him with a passage. Then for long he remained brooding; his hat of ill omen on the sward, so that any gentle breeze which had arisen might play refreshingly through his hair. Dark as were his thoughts his blue eyes were as soft as the periwinkle. Intently he listened for any sound from the nether world, but all was as silent below as above; the house under the ground seemed to be but one more empty tenement in the void. Was that boy asleep, or did he stand waiting at the foot of Slightly's tree, with his dagger in his hand?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在只剩下胡克独自一人了，黑夜很快地降临，他所做的第一件事，就是蹑手蹑脚地走到斯莱特利的那棵树跟前，想弄清楚他是不是能从那里钻进去。他思索了好半晌，把他那顶不吉样的帽子放在草地上，好让吹来的一股清风轻抚他的头发。他的心虽黑，他的蓝眼睛却像长春花一样柔和。他屏息静听地下的动静，可是下面也和上面一样寂静无声。地下的屋子像是一座空无一人的荒宅。那孩子是睡着了，还是站在斯莱特利的树根下，手里拿着刀在等他？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He arrived unmolested at the foot of the shaft, and stood still again, biting at his breath, which had almost left him. As his eyes became accustomed to the dim light various objects in the home under the trees took shape; but the only one on which his greedy gaze rested, long sought for and found at last, was the great bed. On the bed lay Peter fast asleep.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他平安地来到了树洞底下，又一动不动地站在那儿，几乎喘不过气来了。等到他的眼睛逐渐习惯了黑暗，树下屋里的东西，才一件件看清楚；可是他贪婪的眼光，只注视着一件东西，那是他找了很久才终于找到的，就是那张大床。床上躺着熟睡的彼得。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Unaware of the tragedy being enacted above, Peter had continued, for a little time after the children left, to play gaily on his pipes: no doubt rather a forlorn attempt to prove to himself that he did not care. Then he decided not to take his medicine, so as to grieve Wendy. Then he lay down on the bed outside the coverlet, to vex her still more; for she had always tucked them inside it, because you never know that you may not grow chilly at the turn of the night. Then he nearly cried; but it struck him how indignant she would be if he laughed instead; so he laughed a haughty laugh and fell asleep in the middle of it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="彼得一点也不知道上面发生的惨事，孩子们离开后，他继续欢快地吹了一阵笛子。当然，他只是在凄惶中故意这样做，为的是证明他一点也不在乎。然后，他决定不吃药，为的是让温迪伤心。然后．他躺在床上不盖被子，好叫温迪更加烦恼；因为温迪总是把被子给他们盖得严严实实的，怕的是半夜里会着凉。然后彼得几乎要哭出来；可是他忽然又想到，要是他笑，温迪没准会多么生气；于是他狂傲地大笑，没笑完就睡着了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sometimes, though not often, he had dreams, and they were more painful than the dreams of other boys. For hours he could not be separated from these dreams, though he wailed piteously in them. They had to do, I think, with the riddle of his existence. At such times it had been Wendy's custom to take him out of bed and sit with him on her lap, soothing him in dear ways of her own invention, and when he grew calmer to put him back to bed before he quite woke up, so that he should not know of the indignity to which she had subjected him. But on this occasion he had fallen at once into a dreamless sleep. One arm dropped over the edge of the bed, one leg was arched, and the unfinished part of his laugh was stranded on his mouth, which was open, showing the little pearls.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="彼得有时做梦，虽然不常做。可是他的梦比别的孩子更叫人难受。他在梦里常会痛哭，一连几个小时都摆脱不了梦的纠缠。他的梦，我猜想大概是和他那不明底细的来历有关。碰到这种时候，温迪总是把他从床上扶起来，让他坐在自己膝上，用她自己发明的种种亲呢的方法抚慰他；等他悄悄平静下来，不等他醒，又把他放回床上，为的是不让他知道有损他的尊严的那些做法。可是这一回，彼得睡得一点梦都没有，一只胳臂耷拉在床沿下，一条腿拱了起来，没笑完的笑意还挂在嘴角上，嘴张着，露出珍珠般的两排小牙。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Thus defenceless Hook found him. He stood silent at the foot of the tree looking across the chamber at his enemy. Did no feeling of compassion disturb his sombre breast? The man was not wholly evil; he loved flowers (I have been told) and sweet music (he was himself no mean performer on the harpsichord); and, let it be frankly admitted, the idyllic nature of the scene stirred him profoundly. Mastered by his better self he would have returned reluctantly up the tree, but for one thing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="彼得就是这样毫无防御地被胡克发现了。胡克不声不响地站在树脚下，隔着房间望着他的敌人。胡克那阴暗的心里，难道没有激起一丝同情吗？这个人并不是坏到家了：他爱花（我听说），爱美妙的音乐（他自己弹竖琴弹得不坏）；我们得坦白地承认，眼前这幅动人的景象深深地感动了他。要是他的善良一面占了上风，他也许会勉勉强强地走回树上，可是有个东西把他留了下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">What stayed him was Peter's impertinent appearance as he slept. The open mouth, the drooping arm, the arched knee: they were such a personification of cockiness as, taken together, will never again, one may hope, be presented to eyes so sensitive to their offensiveness. They steeled Hook's heart. If his rage had broken him into a hundred pieces every one of them would have disregarded the incident, and leapt at the sleeper.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="留下胡克的是彼得那倨傲不恭的睡态，嘴张着，胳臂耷拉着，膝盖拱着。这种种姿态凑在一起，简直就是十足一个盛气凌人的化身，在胡克那敏感的眼睛里看来，再也不会有比这更气人的了。这使得胡克又硬起了心肠。要是他的怒火把他爆裂成几百块碎片，那么每一片都会不顾一切地飞向那个熟睡的孩子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Though a light from the one lamp shone dimly on the bed, Hook stood in darkness himself, and at the first stealthy step forward he discovered an obstacle, the door of Slightly's tree. It did not entirely fill the aperture, and he had been looking over it. Feeling for the catch, he found to his fury that it was low down, beyond his reach. To his disordered brain it seemed then that the irritating quality in Peter's face and figure visibly increased, and he rattled the door and flung himself against it. Was his enemy to escape him after all?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽然一盏灯的昏光照在床上，胡克却站在黑暗中。刚偷偷地向前迈了一步，他就遇到了一个障碍，斯莱特利的树洞的门。门和洞口并不完全吻合，所以胡克是从门上面朝里看的。他伸手去摸门闩，发见门闩很低，他够不着。在他那纷乱的头脑里，彼得的姿态和面孔似乎越发显得可恶了。他使劲摇晃着门，用身子去撞门。他的敌人究竟能不能逃出他的毒手呢？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Five drops of this he now added to Peter's cup. His hand shook, but it was in exultation rather than in shame. As he did it he avoided glancing at the sleeper, but not lest pity should unnerve him; merely to avoid spilling. Then one long gloating look he cast upon his victim, and turning, wormed his way with difficulty up the tree. As he emerged at the top he looked the very spirit of evil breaking from its hole. Donning his hat at its most rakish angle, he wound his cloak around him, holding one end in front as if to conceal his person from the night, of which it was the blackest part, and muttering strangely to himself, stole away through the trees.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="胡克在彼得的药杯里滴了五滴这种毒药。他的手不住地颤抖，那是因为狂喜，而不是因为羞愧。胡克滴药时，眼睛不去望彼得；不是因为怕起了怜悯而不忍下手，只是怕洒了药。然后，他久久地幸灾乐祸地凝望了他的受害者一眼，转身艰难地蠕动着爬上树去。胡克从树顶上钻出来时，那样子真像恶魔出了魔窟。他流里流气地歪戴着帽子，裹上大衣，用一个衣角遮住前身，像是把自己隐藏起来，不让黑夜看见。其实，他才是黑夜里最黑暗的一件东西。他喃喃地自言自语，说着些奇怪的话，穿过树林溜走了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But what was that? The red in his eye had caught sight of Peter's medicine standing on a ledge within easy reach. He fathomed what it was straightaway, and immediately knew that the sleeper was in his power.</div>

<div class="line_en">Lest he should be taken alive, Hook always carried about his person a dreadful drug, blended by himself of all the death- dealing rings that had come into his possession. These he had boiled down into a yellow liquid quite unknown to science, which was probably the most virulent poison in existence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="胡克生怕自己被人活捉了去，他总是随身带着一瓶可怕的毒药，那是他用他找到的各种致命的毒草炮制成的。他把这些毒草熬成一种黄色的液体，什么科学家都没有见识过的，大概是世界上最毒的一种毒药了。">查看中文翻译</div>

There were no children there, and it was night time; but he addressed all who might be dreaming of the Neverland, and who were therefore nearer to him than you think: boys and girls in their nighties, and naked papooses in their baskets hung from trees.</div>

<div class="line_en">His head almost filled the fourth wall of her little room as he knelt near her in distress.

<div class="line_en">The moon was riding in a cloudy heaven when Peter rose from his tree, begirt (belted) with weapons and wearing little else, to set out upon his perilous quest. It was not such a night as he would have chosen. He had hoped to fly, keeping not far from the ground so that nothing unwonted should escape his eyes; but in that fitful light to have flown low would have meant trailing his shadow through the trees, thus disturbing birds and acquainting a watchful foe that he was astir.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="彼得钻出树洞时，月亮正在云天里行走。他全副武装，却没有多穿衣裳，出发去做危险的搜索。如果任他挑选，他不会挑上这样一个夜晚。他本想低低地飞，离地面很近，好让所有异乎寻常的事都逃不过他的眼睛。但是，在时隐时现的月光下飞得很低，就会把他的影子投在树上，惊动了鸟，使警觉的敌人发现他已经出动。">查看中文翻译</div>

First her voice grew strong, then she popped out of bed, then she was flashing through the room more merry and impudent than ever. She never thought of thanking those who believed, but she would have like to get at the ones who had hissed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="拍手声突然停止了，好像有数不清的母亲们奔进了育儿室，看看到底发生了什么事；不过叮叮铃已经得救了，先是她的声音变得洪亮了；随后，她一阵风似的跳下了床。跟着，她就满屋子乱飞，比以往什么时候都来得欢快和傲慢。她决没有想到要感谢那些拍手的孩子，却一心想着要去对付那些发出嘘声的孩子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He regretted now that he had given the birds of the island such strange names that they are very wild and difficult of approach.</div>

<div class="line_en">There was no other course but to press forward in redskin fashion, as which happily he was an adept (expert). But in what direction, for he could not be sure that the children had been taken to the ship? A light fall of snow had obliterated all foot marks; and a deathly silence pervaded the island, as if for a {footmarks is one word} space Nature stood still in horror of the recent carnage. He had taught the children something of the forest lore that he had himself learned from Tiger Lily and Tinker Bell, and knew that in their dire hour they were not likely to forget it. Slightly, if he had an opportunity, would blaze (cut a mark in) the trees, for instance, Curly would drop seeds, and Wendy would leave her handkerchief at some important place. The morning was needed to search for such guidance, and he could not wait. The upper world had called him, but would give no help.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在没有别的办法，只有学着印第安人的样子，贴着地面爬，幸好他习惯了这样爬。可是朝什么方向爬呢？因为他还不能断定，孩子们是不是给带到了船上。一场小雪掩盖了所有的脚印；岛上笼罩着死一般的寂静，仿佛大自然一时给刚才发生的大屠杀吓坏了。彼得自己曾经从虎莲和叮叮铃那儿学会了一些山林知识，这些，他都传授给了孩子们；他相信，碰到危急关头，他们是不会忘记的。例如，斯莱特利要是遇到机会，会在树上刻上标记；卷毛会在地上撤下树种；温迪会在紧要的地方扔下她的手帕。可是要找到这些目标，需要等到天明，彼得却等不得了。上面的世界在召唤他，却不给他一点帮助。">查看中文翻译</div>
