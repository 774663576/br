<div class="line_en">He lay back with his eyes shut, still sodden in the atmosphere of the dream. It was a vast, luminous dream in which his whole life seemed to stretch out before him like a landscape on a summer evening after rain. It had all occurred inside the glass paperweight, but the surface of the glass was the dome of the sky, and inside the dome everything was flooded with clear soft light in which one could see into interminable distances. The dream had also been comprehended by -- indeed, in some sense it had consisted in -- a gesture of the arm made by his mother, and made again thirty years later by the Jewish woman he had seen on the news film, trying to shelter the small boy from the bullets, before the helicopter blew them both to pieces.</div>

<div class="line_en">His father had disappeared some time earlier, how much earlier he could not remember. He remembered better the rackety, uneasy circumstances of the time: the periodical panics about air-raids and the sheltering in Tube stations, the piles of rubble everywhere, the unintelligible proclamations posted at street corners, the gangs of youths in shirts all the same colour, the enormous queues outside the bakeries, the intermittent machine-gun fire in the distance -- above all, the fact that there was never enough to eat. He remembered long afternoons spent with other boys in scrounging round dustbins and rubbish heaps, picking out the ribs of cabbage leaves, potato peelings, sometimes even scraps of stale breadcrust from which they carefully scraped away the cinders; and also in waiting for the passing of trucks which travelled over a certain route and were known to carry cattle feed, and which, when they jolted over the bad patches in the road, sometimes spilt a few fragments of oil-cake.</div>

<div class="line_en">When his father disappeared, his mother did not show any surprise or any violent grief, but a sudden change came over her. She seemed to have become completely spiritless. It was evident even to Winston that she was waiting for something that she knew must happen. She did everything that was needed -- cooked, washed, mended, made the bed, swept the floor, dusted the mantelpiece -- always very slowly and with a curious lack of superfluous motion, like an artist's lay-figure moving of its own accord. Her large shapely body seemed to relapse naturally into stillness. For hours at a time she would sit almost immobile on the bed, nursing his young sister, a tiny, ailing, very silent child of two or three, with a face made simian by thinness. Very occasionally she would take Winston in her arms and press him against her for a long time without saying anything. He was aware, in spite of his youthfulness and selfishness, that this was somehow connected with the never-mentioned thing that was about to happen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他父亲失踪时，他母亲没有现出惊慌或任何的剧烈情绪，但她突然有了很大的改变。她好像变得无精打采。温斯顿明显看出，她在等待什么事情，而她知道这事情必定会发生。她照常做着家务——烧饭、洗衣、缝补、铺床、擦地、掸灰——慢慢地做着，没有多余的动作，像是艺术家的玩偶自行其是。她健康匀称的身体似乎自然而然地松弛下来，进入一种静止状态。她会一连几小时坐在床上几乎动也不动，抱着他的妹妹，她是一个两三岁的瘦小、多病、很安静的孩子，有一张猴子般的小脸。有时，她也会将温斯顿紧紧抱住，长时间地一句话也不说。尽管他年幼无知，但他意识到，这必定与从不提及但快要发生的事情有关。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He remembered the room where they lived, a dark, close-smelling room that seemed half filled by a bed with a white counterpane. There was a gas ring in the fender, and a shelf where food was kept, and on the landing outside there was a brown earthenware sink, common to several rooms. He remembered his mother's statuesque body bending over the gas ring to stir at something in a saucepan. Above all he remembered his continuous hunger, and the fierce sordid battles at mealtimes. He would ask his mother naggingly, over and over again, why there was not more food, he would shout and storm at her (he even remembered the tones of his voice, which was beginning to break prematurely and sometimes boomed in a peculiar way), or he would attempt a snivelling note of pathos in his efforts to get more than his share. His mother was quite ready to give him more than his share. She took it for granted that he, "the boy", should have the biggest portion; but however much she gave him he invariably demanded more. At every meal she would beseech him not to be selfish and to remember that his little sister was sick and also needed food, but it was no use. He would cry out with rage when she stopped ladling, he would try to wrench the saucepan and spoon out of her hands, he would grab bits from his sister's plate. He knew that he was starving the other two, but he could not help it; he even felt that he had a right to do it. The clamorous hunger in his belly seemed to justify him. Between meals, if his mother did not stand guard, he was constantly pilfering at the wretched store of food on the shelf.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他记得他们居住的房间，黑黑的，味道难闻，一张铺着白床单的床占了半个房间。壁炉的栅栏上有个煤气炉，房间里还有一个放食物的搁板，外面的台阶上，有一个褐色的陶制水池，是几家共用的。他记得母亲高大的身体弯下来，在煤气炉上的锅子里搅拌着什么。他尤其记得持续不断的饥饿，记得吃饭时剧烈而难堪的争吵。他会对母亲纠缠不休，一遍遍问她，为什么没有更多的食物，他会对她喊叫，发脾气（他甚至记得他喊叫的嗓音，开始过早地变声，有时声音又大得出奇），或者他弄出一副哭哭啼啼的模样，以得到更多吃的。他母亲给他的那份总是最多，因为他是“男孩”，但无论母亲给他多少，他总是想得到更多。每次吃饭，母亲就会恳求他别太自私，要知道小妹妹生病，也需要吃的，但这没有用。当她不再给他添饭，他就会生气喊叫，他会设法抢过锅子，从她手里夺走勺子，甚至从妹妹的盘子里抢吃的。他知道，他这么做是让她们两个挨饿，但他情不自禁。他甚至觉得他有权这么做。他肚子饿得咕咕叫好像证明他有理由这么做。不是吃饭的时间，如果他母亲不在意，他总要偷吃搁板上少得可怜的食物。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">One day a chocolate ration was issued. There had been no such issue for weeks or months past. He remembered quite clearly that precious little morsel of chocolate. It was a two-ounce slab (they still talked about ounces in those days) between the three of them. It was obvious that it ought to be divided into three equal parts. Suddenly, as though he were listening to somebody else, Winston heard himself demanding in a loud booming voice that he should be given the whole piece. His mother told him not to be greedy. There was a long, nagging argument that went round and round, with shouts, whines, tears, remonstrances, bargainings. His tiny sister, clinging to her mother with both hands, exactly like a baby monkey, sat looking over her shoulder at him with large, mournful eyes. In the end his mother broke off three-quarters of the chocolate and gave it to Winston, giving the other quarter to his sister. The little girl took hold of it and looked at it dully, perhaps not knowing what it was. Winston stood watching her for a moment. Then with a sudden swift spring he had snatched the piece of chocolate out of his sister's hand and was fleeing for the door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有一天，食物定量中有一块巧克力。已经有好几个星期或好几个月没吃到巧克力了。他清楚地记得那珍贵的小块巧克力。配给他们三个人的那一块有两盎司重（那时人们仍然说盎司）。显然应当平均分成三份。突然，像是听到别人在说，温斯顿听见自己大声要求，他要得到整块巧克力。母亲告诫他别太贪婪。他长时间地、不停地纠缠争辩，喊叫、抱怨、哭泣、抗议、讨价还价。他瘦小的妹妹，正像一只小猴子，两只手紧紧拽住妈妈，坐在那儿，瞪着一双悲切的大眼睛望着他。最后，他母亲掰下四分之三的巧克力给了温斯顿，把剩下的四分之一给了他妹妹。小女孩拿着那一小块巧克力，漠然地看了看，也许不知道这是什么。温斯顿站着看了她一会儿，接着突然一个跳跃，他从妹妹手里一把抢过那块巧克力，夺门而逃。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He stopped, but did not come back. His mother's anxious eyes were fixed on his face. Even now he was thinking about the thing, he did not know what it was that was on the point of happening. His sister, conscious of having been robbed of something, had set up a feeble wail. His mother drew her arm round the child and pressed its face against her breast. Something in the gesture told him that his sister was dying. He turned and fled down the stairs, with the chocolate growing sticky in his hand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他停下了，但没有回去。他母亲焦急的眼睛盯在他脸上。即使现在他想着这件事，他还是不知道即将要发生的是什么。他妹妹意识到有什么东西被抢走了，便发出微弱的哭声。母亲伸出手臂搂住孩子，将孩子的脸贴着她的胸脯。这姿势告诉他，他妹妹快要死了。他转过身，跑下楼梯，手里攥着的那块巧克力有点发黏了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He never saw his mother again. After he had devoured the chocolate he felt somewhat ashamed of himself and hung about in the streets for several hours, until hunger drove him home. When he came back his mother had disappeared. This was already becoming normal at that time. Nothing was gone from the room except his mother and his sister. They had not taken any clothes, not even his mother's overcoat. To this day he did not know with any certainty that his mother was dead. It was perfectly possible that she had merely been sent to a forced-labour camp. As for his sister, she might have been removed, like Winston himself, to one of the colonies for homeless children (Reclamation Centres, they were called) which had grown up as a result of the civil war, or she might have been sent to the labour camp along with his mother, or simply left somewhere or other to die.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他再也没见到母亲。他吃光了巧克力后，觉得有点难为情，便在街上晃荡了几个小时，直到饥饿迫使他回家。他回去的时候，母亲不见了。在那个时候，这已经是司空见惯的事了。除了他母亲和妹妹，家里什么都不少。她们没有带走任何衣服，甚至他母亲的外套也还在。直到今天，他都不能肯定他母亲是否死了。很有可能他母亲只是被送进了劳改营。至于他的妹妹，她可能被带走，像温斯顿自己一样，到一个收留无家可归的孩子的地方（叫做回收中心），在那儿作为战争孤儿长大，或和她母亲一起送到劳改营，或只是被随便遗弃在哪个地方。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The dream was still vivid in his mind, especially the enveloping protecting gesture of the arm in which its whole meaning seemed to be contained. His mind went back to another dream of two months ago. Exactly as his mother had sat on the dingy white-quilted bed, with the child clinging to her, so she had sat in the sunken ship, far underneath him, and drowning deeper every minute, but still looking up at him through the darkening water.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在他内心，这个梦依然生动，尤其是那个用手臂拥抱、庇护的姿势似乎包含着全部的意义。他回想起两个月前做的另一个梦。他母亲同坐在铺了脏棉布床单的床上，紧搂着孩子一样，这次她坐在沉船上，掉在他的下方，每时每刻都在下沉，但仍从黑乎乎的海水中仰望着他。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">From her breathing it was evident that she was going off to sleep again. He would have liked to continue talking about his mother. He did not suppose, from what he could remember of her, that she had been an unusual woman, still less an intelligent one; and yet she had possessed a kind of nobility, a kind of purity, simply because the standards that she obeyed were private ones. Her feelings were her own, and could not be altered from outside. It would not have occurred to her that an action which is ineffectual thereby becomes meaningless. If you loved someone, you loved him, and when you had nothing else to give, you still gave him love. When the last of the chocolate was gone, his mother had clasped the child in her arms. It was no use, it changed nothing, it did not produce more chocolate, it did not avert the child's death or her own; but it seemed natural to her to do it. The refugee woman in the boat had also covered the little boy with her arm, which was no more use against the bullets than a sheet of paper. The terrible thing that the Party had done was to persuade you that mere impulses, mere feelings, were of no account, while at the same time robbing you of all power over the material world. When once you were in the grip of the Party, what you felt or did not feel, what you did or refrained from doing, made literally no difference. Whatever happened you vanished, and neither you nor your actions were ever heard of again. You were lifted clean out of the stream of history. And yet to the people of only two generations ago this would not have seemed all-important, because they were not attempting to alter history. They were governed by private loyalties which they did not question. What mattered were individual relationships, and a completely helpless gesture, an embrace, a tear, a word spoken to a dying man, could have value in itself. The proles, it suddenly occurred to him, had remained in this condition. They were not loyal to a party or a country or an idea, they were loyal to one another. For the first time in his life he did not despise the proles or think of them merely as an inert force which would one day spring to life and regenerate the world. The proles had stayed human. They had not become hardened inside. They had held on to the primitive emotions which he himself had to re-learn by conscious effort. And in thinking this he remembered, without apparent relevance, how a few weeks ago he had seen a severed hand lying on the pavement and had kicked it into the gutter as though it had been a cabbage-stalk.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从她的呼吸可知，她显然又睡着了。他很想继续谈他的母亲。就他的记忆来说，他不认为他母亲是一个与众不同的女人，也并不特别聪明；然而，她拥有一种高贵、一种纯粹，就因为她遵循的标准是自己的。她有自己的感情，不受外界的影响。在她那儿，并不因为一个行为没有效果就变得没有意义。如果你爱一个人，你就是爱他，即使你一无所有，你仍然可以给他爱。当最后一块巧克力被抢走了，他母亲就把孩子紧紧抱在怀里。这无济于事，这改变不了什么，这不会拥有更多的巧克力，这不能挽救孩子或她自己的死亡；但她这么做似乎很自然。船上那个避难的女人用手臂护着小男孩，不会比用一张纸挡住子弹更有效。党的所作所为的可怕之处在于，它让你相信，只有冲动、只有感情并无任何意义，但同时却又在物质世界层面上夺走你所有的力量。你一旦受党的控制，无论你是否意识到，你所做的或没做的，都没有什么不同。无论发生什么，你消失了，你和你的行为都不再为人所知。你被从历史的长河中清洗出去。然而，对只是两代人之前的人们来说，这似乎并不那么重要，因为他们并不试图改变历史。他们保持人与人之间的忠诚，他们想念这种忠诚。重要的是人与人的关系，一种完全无用的姿势、一个拥抱、一滴眼泪、对垂死者说的一个词，这些本身就有价值。他突然想到，无产者还保留了这种状态。他们并不忠于一个党、一个国家或一种观念，他们彼此忠诚。他有生以来第一次不讨厌无产者，或第一次想到他们不只是一种惰性的力量，有朝一日，他们会行动起来，改造世界。无产者保持着人性。他们的内心没有变得坚硬。他们拥有原始的激情，而这种激情他自己是通过有意识的努力再度认识的。想到这里，他突然想起，仅仅几星期前，他看见一只残臂丢在人行道上，便把它踢到水沟里，好像那是一段白菜梗。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He thought of the telescreen with its never-sleeping ear. They could spy upon you night and day, but if you kept your head you could still outwit them. With all their cleverness they had never mastered the secret of finding out what another human being was thinking. Perhaps that was less true when you were actually in their hands. One did not know what happened inside the Ministry of Love, but it was possible to guess: tortures, drugs, delicate instruments that registered your nervous reactions, gradual wearing-down by sleeplessness and solitude and persistent questioning. Facts, at any rate, could not be kept hidden. They could be tracked down by enquiry, they could be squeezed out of you by torture. But if the object was not to stay alive but to stay human, what difference did it ultimately make? They could not alter your feelings: for that matter you could not alter them yourself, even if you wanted to. They could lay bare in the utmost detail everything that you had done or said or thought; but the inner heart, whose workings were mysterious even to yourself, remained impregnable.</div>
