<div class="line_en">That air of respectability was carefully concocted by her mother. My grandmother, LaRue, had come of age in the 1950s, in the decade of idealistic fever that burned after World War II. LaRue's father was an alcoholic in a time before the language of addiction and empathy had been invented, when alcoholics weren't called alcoholics, they were called drunks. She was from the "wrong kind" of family but embedded in a pious Mormon community that, like many communities, visited the crimes of the parents on the children. She was deemed unmarriageable by the respectable men in town. When she met and married my grandfather -- a good-natured young man just out of the navy -- she dedicated herself to constructing the perfect family, or at least the appearance of it. This would, she believed, shield her daughters from the social contempt that had so wounded her.</div>

<div class="line_en">My mother, Faye, was a mailman's daughter. She grew up in town, in a yellow house with a white picket fence lined with purple irises. Her mother was a seamstress, the best in the valley some said, so as a young woman Faye wore beautiful clothes, all perfectly tailored, from velvet jackets and polyester trousers to woolen pantsuits and gabardine dresses. She attended church and participated in school and community activities. Her life had an air of intense order, normalcy, and unassailable respectability.</div>

<div class="line_en">That is to say, my mother responded willfully to the respectability heaped upon her. Grandma wanted to give her daughter the gift she herself had never had, the gift of coming from a good family. But Faye didn't want it. My mother was not a social revolutionary -- even at the peak of her rebellion she preserved her Mormon faith, with its devotion to marriage and motherhood -- but the social upheavals of the 1970s did seem to have at least one effect on her: she didn't want the white picket fence and gabardine dresses.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="也就是说，我母亲对堆积在她身上的体面做出了任性的回应。外婆想把自己从未有过的礼物送给女儿，这个礼物就是一个好的家庭出身。但法耶不想要这个。我母亲虽然不是社会变革者——甚至在最叛逆的时期她也谨遵摩门教信仰，忠于婚姻和母性——但二十世纪七十年代的社会剧变似乎至少对她产生了一个影响：她不再想要白色尖桩栅栏和华达呢礼服。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One result of this was the white picket fence and the closet of handmade clothes. Another was that her eldest daughter married a severe young man with jet-black hair and an appetite for unconventionality.</div>

<div class="line_en">My mother told me dozens of stories of her childhood, of Grandma fretting about her oldest daughter's social standing, about whether her piqué dress was the proper cut, or her velvet slacks the correct shade of blue. These stories nearly always ended with my father swooping in and trading out the velvet for blue jeans. One telling in particular has stayed with me. I am seven or eight and am in my room dressing for church. I have taken a damp rag to my face, hands and feet, scrubbing only the skin that will be visible. Mother watches me pass a cotton dress over my head, which I have chosen for its long sleeves so I won't have to wash my arms, and a jealousy lights her eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="母亲给我讲过几十个关于她童年的故事，关于外婆如何为大女儿的社会地位而烦恼，为她的凹凸纹细布裙是否剪裁得当而烦恼，为她的蓝色天鹅绒宽松长裤颜色正不正而烦恼。这些故事几乎总是以我父亲乘虚而入，出卖天鹅绒换取蓝牛仔裤而告终。有一件事深深铭刻在我记忆中。那时我七八岁，正在房间里换去教堂的衣服。我拿了一块湿抹布擦脸、手和脚，但只擦会露出来的部分皮肤。我选了一件长袖棉布裙，这样我就不必洗胳膊了。母亲看着我把裙子胡乱套在头上，嫉妒点亮了她的双眼。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Although I passed my childhood on the same mountain that my father had passed his, slopping pigs in the same iron trough, I know very little about his boyhood. He never talked about it, so all I have to go on are hints from my mother, who told me that, in his younger years, Grandpa-down-the-hill had been violent, with a hair-trigger temper. Mother's use of the words "had been" always struck me as funny. We all knew better than to cross Grandpa. He had a short fuse, that was just fact and anybody in the valley could have told you as much. He was weatherworn inside and out, as taut and rugged as the horses he ran wild on the mountain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽然我的童年也是在父亲成长的那座山中度过，我们还在同一个食槽喂过猪，但我对他的童年知之甚少。他从未说起过，所以我对他的了解全部来自我母亲。她告诉我，在我父亲小时候，山下爷爷曾经脾气火爆，一点就着。母亲使用“曾经”一词总是让我觉得好笑。我们都知道最好别惹爷爷生气。他脾气暴躁是事实，山谷里每一个人都可以证实这点。他饱经风霜，全身上下像他放养在山上的野马一样粗糙而结实。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">My father, Gene, was one of those young men who somehow manage to seem both solemn and mischievous. His physical appearance was striking -- ebony hair, a strict, angular face, nose like an arrow pointing toward fierce, deep-set eyes. His lips were often pressed together in a jocular grin, as if all the world were his to laugh at.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我父亲吉恩是那种看上去既严肃又调皮的年轻人。他的外表很引人注目——乌黑的头发，棱角分明的脸，鼻子像一枚箭头一样指向凶巴巴的深邃的眼睛。他常常抿着嘴笑，像是在开玩笑，仿佛全世界都是他的笑料似的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dad's mother worked for the Farm Bureau in town. As an adult, Dad would develop fierce opinions about women working, radical even for our rural Mormon community. "A woman's place is in the home," he would say every time he saw a married woman working in town. Now I'm older, I sometimes wonder if Dad's fervor had more to do with his own mother than with doctrine. I wonder if he just wished that she had been home, so he wouldn't have been left for all those long hours with Grandpa's temper.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="奶奶曾在镇上的农业局上班。成年后的父亲强烈反对女人工作，其观点甚至对我们这种乡间摩门教社区来说都很激进。“女人的位置在家里。”每当看到已婚女性在城里上班，他都会这么说。现在我长大些了，有时会想，父亲对此的强烈抵触是否更多与他母亲有关，而非教条所致。我在想他是否只是希望她当时能待在家里，这样他就不用和坏脾气的爷爷长时间单独相处了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They met in town. Faye was waitressing at the bowling alley one Friday night when Gene wandered in with a pack of his friends. She'd never seen him before, so she knew immediately that he wasn't from town and must have come from the mountains surrounding the valley. Farm life had made Gene different from other young men: he was serious for his age, more physically impressive and independent-minded.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们在城里相遇了。法耶当时在一家保龄球馆当服务员。一个周五的晚上，吉恩和一群朋友闲逛进来。她以前从未见过他，所以马上就知道他不是城里人，一定是从山谷周围的山上来的。和其他年轻男人相比，农场生活让吉恩显得与众不同：他身上有股超越同龄人的严肃认真劲儿，身体健壮，富有主见，令人印象深刻。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There's a sense of sovereignty that comes from life on a mountain, a perception of privacy and isolation, even of dominion. In that vast space you can sail unaccompanied for hours, afloat on pine and brush and rock. It's a tranquillity born of sheer immensity; it calms with its very magnitude, which renders the merely human of no consequence. Gene was formed by this alpine hypnosis, this hushing of human drama.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the valley, Faye tried to stop her ears against the constant gossip of a small town, whose opinions pushed in through the windows and crept under the doors. Mother often described herself as a pleaser: she said she couldn't stop herself from speculating what people wanted her to be, and from contorting herself, compulsively, unwillingly, into whatever it was. Living in her respectable house in the center of town, crowded by four other houses, each so near anyone could peer through the windows and whisper a judgment, Faye felt trapped.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在山谷里，法耶试图不去听小镇上不断涌现的流言蜚语，它们透过窗户闯入，顺着门底钻了进来。母亲常把自己描述成一个讨好者，说她无法阻止自己去猜测别人想要她成为什么样的人，也无法阻止自己极不情愿地强迫自己做出改变。住在镇中心的体面房子里，周围紧挨着另外四幢房子，彼此之间近在咫尺，谁都可以透过窗户往里看，窃窃私语着对她评头论足。法耶感觉像是被困在牢笼之中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I've often imagined the moment when Gene took Faye to the top of Buck's Peak and she was, for the first time, unable to see the faces or hear the voices of the people in the town below. They were far away. Dwarfed by the mountain, hushed by the wind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我经常想象吉恩把法耶带到巴克峰顶的那一刻。平生第一次，她看不见下面城镇里人们的面孔，也听不见他们的聒噪。这些都变得遥远。高山令其渺小，山风让其缄默。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Motherused to tell a story from the time before she was married. She had been close to her brother Lynn, so she took him to meet the man she hoped would be her husband. It was summer, dusk, and Dad's cousins were roughhousing the way they did after a harvest.

He wanted to call the police.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I told him to listen," Mother would say, tears in her eyes from laughing. She always told this story the same way, and it was such a favorite that if she departed in any way from the usual script, we'd tell it for her. "I told him to pay attention to the actual words they were shouting. Everyone sounded mad as hornets, but really they were having a lovely conversation. You had to listen to what they were saying, not how they were saying it. I told him, That's just how Westovers talk!"</div>

Served him right, we thought, for his meddling, for trying to draw Mother back into that world of gabardine dresses and cream shoes.

<div class="line_en">What I know about the engagement has come to me in bits and pieces, mostly from the stories Mother told. I know she had the ring before Dad served a mission -- which was expected of all faithful Mormon men -- and spent two years proselytizing in Florida. Lynn took advantage of this absence to introduce his sister to every marriageable man he could find this side of the Rockies, but none could make her forget the stern farm boy who ruled over his own mountain.</div>

We rarely visited them -- I didn't even know where most of them lived -- and it was even rarer for them to visit the mountain.

<div class="line_en">I don't know when the man in that photograph became the man I know as my father. Perhaps there was no single moment. Dad married when he was twenty-one, had his first son, my brother Tony, at twenty-two. When he was twenty-four, Dad asked Mother if they could hire an herbalist to midwife my brother Shawn. She agreed. Was that the first hint, or was it just Gene being Gene, eccentric and unconventional, trying to shock his disapproving in-laws? After all, when Tyler was born twenty months later, the birth took place in a hospital. When Dad was twenty-seven, Luke was born, at home, delivered by a midwife. Dad decided not to file for a birth certificate, a decision he repeated with Audrey, Richard and me. A few years later, around the time he turned thirty, Dad pulled my brothers out of school. I don't remember it, because it was before I was born, but I wonder if perhaps that was a turning point. In the four years that followed, Dad got rid of the telephone and chose not to renew his license to drive. He stopped registering and insuring the family car. Then he began to hoard food.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="韦弗家事件发生十四年后，我坐在大学教室里，听一位心理学教授描述一种叫作双相情感障碍[4]的疾病。在此之前我从未听说过精神疾病这回事。我知道人会发疯——有人把死猫套在头上，有人爱上了一根萝卜——但我从未想到，一个人功能健全，头脑清晰，令人信服，却仍可能在哪方面有问题。【注：[4]bipolar disorder，又称躁郁症。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The professor recited facts in a dull, earthy voice: the average age of onset is twenty-five; there may be no symptoms before then.</div>

<div class="line_en">This last part sounds like my father, but it is not the father my older brothers remember. Dad had just turned forty when the Feds laid siege to the Weavers, an event that confirmed his worst fears. After that he was at war, even if the war was only in his head. Perhaps that is why Tony looks at that photo and sees his father, and I see a stranger.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这最后一部分描述听起来像我父亲，却不是哥哥们记忆中的父亲。联邦政府人员围困韦弗一家的那一年，爸爸刚满四十岁，这一事件证实了他最担心的事。从那以后，他就一直处于备战状态，即便战争只存在于他的想象中。也许这就是为什么托尼在那张照片里看到的是他父亲，而我看到的却是一个陌生人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">That smile haunts me. It was constant, the only eternal thing, inscrutable, detached, dispassionate. Now that I'm older and I've taken the trouble to get to know her, mostly through my aunts and uncles, I know she was none of those things.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那微笑让我念念不忘。始终如一，神秘，超然，冷静，是唯一恒久不变之物。如今我长大了，主要通过姨妈和舅舅尽力去了解她，我于是知道她绝不像看上去的那样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When I picture her now I conjure a single image, as if my memory is a slide projector and the tray is stuck. She's sitting on a cushioned bench. Her hair pushes out of her head in tight curls, and her lips are pulled into a polite smile, which is welded in place. Her eyes are pleasant but unoccupied, as if she's observing a staged drama.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在想象她的样子，我的脑海里浮现出一个孤零零的画面，就好像我的记忆是一台幻灯机，而片盒却卡住了。画面上，她坐在带坐垫的长椅上，留着一头紧密的卷发，嘴角露出恰到好处的礼貌微笑。她的眼睛充满善意，安静闲适，仿佛在看一出舞台剧。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">All those years I was passing in and out of her kitchen, and she never told me what it had been like for her, watching her daughter shut herself away, walled in by phantoms and paranoias.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这些年来，我多次进出她的厨房，但她从未告诉过我，眼睁睁看着女儿把自己隔绝起来，封闭在幻觉和偏执筑起的高墙里，她心里是什么滋味。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I attended the memorial. It was open casket and I found myself searching her face. The embalmers hadn't gotten her lips right -- the gracious smile she'd worn like an iron mask had been stripped away. It was the first time I'd seen her without it and that's when it finally occurred to me: that Grandma was the only person who might have understood what was happening to me. How the paranoia and fundamentalism were carving up my life, how they were taking from me the people I cared about and leaving only degrees and certificates -- an air of respectability -- in their place. What was happening now had happened before. This was the second severing of mother and daughter. The tape was playing in a loop.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我参加了外婆的追悼会。在打开的棺材面前，我的目光在她脸上搜寻。殓尸官没处理好她的嘴唇——一直像铁面具般挂在她嘴角的亲切微笑消失了。这是我第一次看到她没了微笑，这时我才终于意识到，外婆生前可能是唯一一个了解我正在经历什么的人：偏执狂和原教旨主义如何瓜分了我的人生，它们如何把我在乎的人从我身边带走，只留下学位和证书——一种体面的虚空。现在正在发生的以前也曾发生。母女分离再度重演。磁带在循环播放。">查看中文翻译</div>
