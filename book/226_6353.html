<div class="line_en">I decided to go to London first, to stay at a hotel for a few nights, and see all the sights of that great city. I knew it would be very different from the last time I was in London, when I was working at the warehouse. Now I was adult, and educated, and had money.</div>

<div class="line_en">The hotel I chose was called the Golden Cross, and because I looked so young, I was given a very small, dark room in the roof. But I did not feel confident enough to complain.</div>

<div class="line_en">"They've put you in number 44? I'll soon change that."

<div class="line_en">We travelled to Yarmouth by coach, and when we arrived, Steerforth stayed at the hotel while I went to Barkis's house to find Peggotty. When I knocked at the door, Peggotty opened it, and did not recognize me for a moment. I had continued to write to her regularly, but we had not seen each other for seven years, and I was no longer the small boy she remembered. But when she realized I was her Master David, she sobbed and sobbed with delight, holding me in her arms as she had always done. Soon she was calmer, and we talked about the events of the last few years. I heard that she was very happy with Mr Barkis, who; however, was ill in bed at the time. She was so pleased to see me that she insisted I should sleep at her house during my stay in Yarmouth, in the little bedroom she had al ways kept for me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们乘坐长途马车到雅茅斯，到了之后，斯提福兹先在一家旅馆落脚，我到巴克斯家去找辟果提。我敲了敲门，辟果提出来了，她当时没认出我。我虽然一直给她写信，从未间断，但我们彼此已有7年没见面，我已不再是她记忆中的小男孩了。然而，当她意识到我就是她的大卫少爷时，她激动得哭了又哭，还象从前那样把我拥在她怀里，她很快就平静了下来，我们互相说起近几年发生的事情。她说她跟巴克斯先生过得很幸福，可他现在却生病在床。她见到我是那么高兴，坚持要我在雅茅斯逗留期间住到他们家，睡那间她一直为我保留着的小卧房。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well!" cried Daniel Peggotty, his large face red and shining with delight. "It's wonderful, Master David, that you two gentlemen have come here tonight of all nights!

I did not know what to say, unsure whether I still loved Emily and was therefore jealous of Ham, or whether I was glad they were going to be happy together.

I know you understand and love them, and I admire you all the more for it!"</div>

<div class="line_en">"Very good," said my aunt, jumping up. "In that case, let's go immediately to see Mr Spenlow. He's a partner in an important law firm, and I think he'll agree to train you. We'll have to pay him, of course, but after several years you'll be a properly trained lawyer, and be able to earn your own money."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“很好，”姨婆说着跳起来，“既然这样，我们马上去见斯本罗先生，他是一家颇为重要的律师事务所的合伙人，我想他会同意收你为徒，当然我们得付学费。可几年下来你就能成为一名训练有素的律师，而且可以自己挣钱。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And so we carried out this plan. My aunt paid Mr Spenlow's firm a thousand pounds, and I promised to work hard and do my best to become a successful lawyer. Before she returned to Dover, my aunt rented a small flat for me, at the top of a house near the law courts, and I moved in at once.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="紧接着，我们实施了这项计划。姨婆付给斯本罗事务所1000英镑，我答应努力学习，尽可能成为一名成功的律师。姨婆回多佛之前，给我租了一套小房子，位于法院附近一幢楼的顶层，我很快搬了进去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At first it seemed very exciting to walk through the busy streets after a long day in the courts or at Mr Spenlow's dusty office, and know that I had my own home to return to. But when I had climbed up all the stairs, and entered my sitting room, it no longer seemed so exciting. In fact, my flat looked empty and depressing. So, after two days of loneliness, I was very glad to receive my first visitor, Steerforth, and because I was so happy to see him, I invited him and two friends of his to dinner the next evening.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一开始，我每天从法院或斯本罗事务所那满是尘土的办公室工作一天之后，穿过热闹繁华的街区，想到我也有自己的家可回，就异常兴奋。可当我爬完所有的楼梯，走进客厅，似乎就不再那么兴奋了。事实上，我的房间看上去空荡荡的，令人抑郁。所以，孤单单地呆了两天后，我很高兴我的第一位客人斯提福兹来访。见到他后我非常开心。于是又邀请他和他的两位朋友第二天晚上到我的寓所聚餐。">查看中文翻译</div>

Then a man in a little box looked out of the fog, and took money from somebody. Soon we were sitting high up in a very hot, very crowded theatre. There were bright lights, and there was music, but I could not understand what anyone was saying, and the whole building seemed to swim in front of my eyes.</div>

<div class="line_en">As it was my first dinner party, I did not know what to buy, but I ordered cooked dishes of chicken and fish from the restaurant, bought cheese and fruit from the market, and had a large number of bottles of wine delivered. I was quite frightened by how much money I had spent, but when Steerforth and his friends arrived, I soon became more cheerful. The party was a great success, and we all enjoyed ourselves very much. We ate, and drank, and smoked, and drank again. I was constantly opening bottles of wine, and became unusually talkative. I began to feel rather strange, and when I caught sight of myself in a mirror, I seemed very pale. I had to confess to myself that I looked drunk.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="由于我是头一次搞聚餐，不知道该买什么，就从餐馆里预定了现成的一只鸡和一条鱼，又从商店里买了些奶酪和水果，还让人送到家好几瓶酒。自己一下子花掉那么多钱，真有点可怕。可当斯提福兹和他的朋友到来之后，我的心情立刻好转了。聚会办得十分成功，我们玩得很开心，我们边吃边喝边抽烟，然后又喝。我不停地打开一瓶又一瓶的酒，而且变得异常健谈，我开始感觉不对劲，照着镜子一看，自己已脸色苍白。我不得不承认自己的醉态。">查看中文翻译</div>

What a terrible, sleepless night I spent! How ill I felt! How dry my mouth was! But the next morning I felt even worse. I was so miser able and ashamed that I had been so stupid, and that Agnes had seen me drunk. I could not even apologize to her, because I did not know where she was staying in London. I spent the whole day with my head in my hands, in my dirty, smoky room, surrounded by empty wine bottles.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿格尼斯的意见我向来都听，这次也一样。我不记得当时是怎么回的家，但我依然记得是斯提福兹帮我脱了衣服，把我弄上床。多么可怕、难眠的一宿！我感觉好难受！口干舌燥！而第二天上午情况更糟，我为自己所干的蠢事感到既痛苦又羞愧，还让阿格尼斯看见了我的醉态。我甚至没法向她致歉，因为我不知道她住在伦敦的哪个地方。我双手捧着自己的脑袋，在脏乱不堪、乌烟障气、满是空酒瓶的屋子里呆了一整天。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But the next day a note was delivered to my flat. It was from Agnes, asking me to visit her at the house where she was staying. I went straight there after my day's work at the office.</div>

<div class="line_en">She looked so quiet and good, and reminded me so much of my happy schooldays in Canterbury, that I could not help crying.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她看上去是那么文静，气色那么好，让我回想起在坎特伯雷城那段美好的学生生活，我情不自禁地哭起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"David, don't be unhappy," she said cheerfully. "You know you can trust me, and I'll always be your friend."</div>

<div class="line_en">"I'm so sorry, Agnes," I said, "that you saw me like that. I wish I were dead!"</div>

<div class="line_en">"I wasn't thinking of that. I judge him from what you've told me about him, and your character, and his influence over you." Agnes spoke very seriously, and her words went straight to my heart. "I'm certain I'm right. You've made a dangerous friend, David, because you're so trusting. Please remember what I say -- and forgive me for saying it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不是指醉酒的事。我是从你谈起他的话语中，从你的性格和他对你所产生的影响来判断的。”阿格尼斯认真地说道，她的话触动了我的心。“我认定我是对的。你结识了一位危险的朋友，大卫，因为你太容易轻信他人了。请记住我的话——并请原谅我的直率。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Agnes agreed, smiling, and then said suddenly, "Have you seen Uriah Heep?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿格尼斯笑着答应着，然后她突然问道，“你见过尤赖亚·希普吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm worried, David," answered Agnes with sadness in her beautiful eyes. "I think he's going to be Father's partner."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我很担心，大卫，”阿格尼斯回答，美丽的双眼蒙上一层郁忧。“我想他将要成为父亲的合伙人了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No," I replied. "Is he in London? What's he doing here?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没有啊，”我回答，“他在伦敦吗？他来这里来干什么？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What? That creature? He's so unpleasant! You must prevent your father from agreeing to it, Agnes!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“什么？那个怪物？他实在不讨人喜欢！你必须阻止你父亲与他合伙经营，阿格尼斯！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Agnes smiled miserably. "My poor father has no choice. You know how unhappy he has often been? And of course you've seen him drinking. You see, he loved my mother very much, and when she died, he didn't care so much about his work. That's when he started drinking. Uriah's very clever -- he knows all this, and he's been very useful to Father, doing all the work that Father had forgotten or didn't want to do. Father really needs Uriah now, to keep his business going. And Uriah himself pretends to be humble and grateful, but in fact he's in a strong position, and is insisting on becoming a partner. Father is ashamed of himself, but he has to agree. Poor Father! I'd do anything to help him, any thing!" And Agnes sobbed bitterly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿格尼斯苦笑了一下，“可怜的父亲没有别的选择，你知道他常常是多么的忧郁？当然你也见过他酗酒。你知道，他非常爱我的母亲，她死后，他便不在那么专心他的工作。也就是那时他开始酗酒。尤赖亚很聪明——他知道这一切，他对父亲帮助很大，帮父亲做所有他忘记做或者不想做的事情。如今，为了能继续维持他的公司，父亲的确已经离不了尤赖亚了。尤赖亚自己则装出一幅卑谦、感恩戴德的样子，而实际上，他占据上风，坚持要做父亲的合伙人。父亲为自己感到羞愧，可也不得不同意。可怜的父亲！我愿意做任何事情来帮助他！任何事！”阿格尼斯伤心痛哭。以前我从未见阿格尼斯哭过。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I had never seen Agnes cry before. It made me so sad that I could only say helplessly, "My dear Agnes! Please don't cry!" However, in a few minutes she was calm again, and I was able to leave her, promising to visit her and her father in Canter bury very soon.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我难过得只能说些无济于事的话，“亲爱的阿格尼斯！求你别哭了！”不过，几分钟后，她又恢复了平静，我也能告辞出来了，我答应她我会很快去坎特伯雷看望她和她的父亲。">查看中文翻译</div>
