<div class="line_en">Another and far more important reason than the delivery of a pair of embroidered gloves impelled Hester, at this time, to seek an interview with a personage of so much power and activity in the affairs of the settlement. It had reached her ears, that there was a design on the part of some of the leading inhabitants, cherishing the more rigid order of principles in religion and government, to deprive her of her child. On the supposition that Pearl, as already hinted, was of demon origin, these good people not unreasonably argued that a Christian interest in the mother's soul required them to remove such a stumbling-block from her path. If the child, on the other hand, were really capable of moral and religious growth, and possessed the elements of ultimate salvation, then, surely, it would enjoy all the fairer prospect of these advantages, by being transferred to wiser and better guardianship than Hester Prynne's. Among those who promoted the design, Governor Bellingham was said to be one of the most busy. It may appear singular, and, indeed, not a little ludicrous, that an affair of this kind, which, in later days, would have been referred to no higher jurisdiction than that of the selectmen of the town, should then have been a question publicly discussed, and on which statesmen of eminence took sides. At that epoch of pristine simplicity, however, matters of even slighter public interest, and of far less intrinsic weight, than the welfare of Hester and her child, were strangely mixed up with the deliberations of legislators and acts of state. The period was hardly, if at all, earlier than that of our story, when a dispute concerning the right of property in a pig, not only caused a fierce and bitter contest in the legislative body of the colony, but resulted in an important modification of the framework itself of the legislature.</div>

<div class="line_en">HESTER PRYNNE went, one day, to the mansion of Governor Bellingham, with a pair of gloves, which she had fringed and embroidered to his order, and which were to be worn on some great occasion of state; for, though the chances of a popular election had caused this former ruler to descend a step or two from the highest rank, he still held an honourable and influential place among the colonial magistracy.</div>

<div class="line_en">But it was a remarkable attribute of this garb, and, indeed, of the child's whole appearance, that it irresistibly and inevitably reminded the beholder of the token which Hester Prynne was doomed to wear upon her bosom. It was the scarlet letter in another form; the scarlet letter endowed with life! The mother herself -- as if the red ignominy were so deeply scorched into her brain that all her conceptions assumed its form -- had carefully wrought out the similitude; lavishing many hours of morbid ingenuity, to create an analogy between the object of her affection and the emblem of her guilt and torture. But, in truth, Pearl was the one, as well as the other; and only in consequence of that identity had Hester contrived so perfectly to represent the scarlet letter in her appearance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，这身衣裙，老实讲，还有这孩子的整个外貌，实在引人注目，使目睹者不可遏止也难以避免地想到海丝特·白兰胸前注定要佩戴的那个标记。孩子是另一种形式的红字，是被赋予了生命的红字！做母亲的头脑中似乎给这红色的耻辱所深深印烙，她的一切观念都采取了它的形式，才精心制作出来了这个相仿的对应物；她不借花费许多时间，用病态的才智创造出这个既象她的慈爱的对象又象她的罪孽和折磨的标志的作品。然而，事实上，恰恰是珠儿集二者于一身；而且，也正因为有了这个同一性，海丝特才能如此完美地用孩子的外表率象征她的红字。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Without further adventure, they reached the dwelling of Governor Bellingham. This was a large wooden house, built in a fashion of which there are specimens still extant in the streets of our elder towns; now moss-grown, crumbling to decay, and melancholy at heart with the many sorrowful or joyful occurrences, remembered or forgotten, that have happened, and passed away, within their dusky chambers. Then, however, there was the freshness of the passing year on its exterior, and the cheerfulness, gleaming forth from the sunny windows, of a human habitation, into which death had never entered. It had, indeed, a very cheery aspect; the walls being overspread with a kind of stucco, in which fragments of broken glass were intermixed; so that, when the sunshine fell aslant-wise over the front of the edifice, it glittered and sparkled as if diamonds had been flung against it by the double handful. The brilliancy might have befitted Aladdin's palace, rather than the mansion of a grave old Puritan ruler. It was further decorated with strange and seemingly cabalistic figures and diagrams, suitable to the quaint taste of the age, which had been drawn in the stucco when newly laid on, and had now grown hard and durable, for the admiration of after times.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="之后，她们便一路平安地来到了贝灵汉总督的住所。这是一座宏大的木造宅邸，那种建筑形式在今天的一些老城镇的街道上仍可见其遗风；不过如今已是盲苔丛生，招摇欲坠，其昏暗的房间中发生过并消逝了的那些悲欢离合，无论是记忆犹新还是全然忘却，都令人缀然伤感。然而在当年，这样的宅邸，外观上仍保持着初建年代的清新，从洒满阳光的窗中闪烁着人丁的欢乐，家中还没有人去世。确实，住宅呈现着一派欣然景象：墙面除着一层拉毛灰泥，由于里面掺和着大量的碎玻璃碴，当阳光斜照到大厦的前脸时，便会闪着熔目的光芒，好像有一双手在向它抛撤着钻石。这种夺目的光彩或许更适合阿拉丁的宫殿，面对于一个庄重的清教徒统治者则并不相宜。大厦的前脸还装饰着当年显得情调古雅、怪模怪样、看着很神秘的人形和图象，都是在涂灰泥时画就的，此时已变得坚实耐久，供后世观赏了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They approached the door; which was of an arched form, and flanked on each side by a narrow tower or projection of the edifice, in both of which were lattice-windows, with wooden shutters to close over them at need. Lifting the iron hammer that hung at the portal, Hester Prynne gave a summons, which was answered by one of the Governor's bond-servants; a free-born Englishman, but now a seven years' slave. During that term he was to be the property of his master, and as much a commodity of bargain and sale as an ox, or a joint-stool. The serf wore the blue coat, which was the customary garb of serving-men at that period, and long before, in the old hereditary halls of England.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Nevertheless, I will enter," answered Hester Prynne; and the bond-servant, perhaps judging from the decision of her air, and the glittering symbol in her bosom, that she was a great lady in the land, offered no opposition.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不过，我还是要进去，”海丝特·白兰回答说，那家奴大概是从她那不容置辩的神气和胸前闪光的标志判断，把她当作了本地的一位贵妇，没有表示反对。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yea, forsooth," replied the bond-servant, staring with wide-open eyes at the scarlet letter, which, being a new-comer in the country, he had never before seen.

<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，在家，”那家奴一边回答，一边睁大眼睛瞪着那红字，他来到这地方只有几年，以前还从未见过那标记。“是的，大人在。只是他有—两位牧师陪着，还有一个医生。你此刻恐怕不能见大人。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So the mother and little Pearl were admitted into the hall of entrance. With many variations, suggested by the nature of his building-materials, diversity of climate, and a different mode of social life, Governor Bellingham had planned his new habitation after the residences of gentlemen of fair estate in his native land. Here, then, was a wide and reasonably lofty hall, extending through the whole depth of the house and forming a medium of general communication, more or less directly, with all the other apartments. At one extremity, this spacious room was lighted by the windows of the two towers, which formed a small recess on either side of the portal. At the other end, though partly muffled by a curtain, it was more powerfully illuminated by one of those embowed hall-windows which we read of in old books, and which was provided with a keep and cushioned seat. Here, on the cushion, lay a folio tome, probably of the Chronicles of England, or other such substantial literature; even as, in our own days, we scatter gilded volumes on the centre-table, to be turned over by the casual guest. The furniture of the hall consisted of some ponderous chairs, the backs of which were elaborately carved with wreaths of oaken flowers; and likewise a table in the same taste; the whole being of the Elizabethan age, or perhaps earlier, and heirlooms, transferred hither from the Governor's paternal home. On the table -- in token that the sentiment of old English hospitality had not been left behind -- stood a large pewter tankard, at the bottom of which, had Hester or Pearl peeped into it, they might have seen the frothy remnant of a recent draught of ale.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是，母亲和小珠儿被引进了入门的大厅。贝灵汉总督是按照故乡广有土地的乡绅的住宅样式来设计他在殖民地的新居的，但又因他所使用的建筑树料的性质、此地气候的差异以及社交生活的不同模式，作了不少变动。于是，这座宅邸中就有了—座宽敞而高度恰到好处的大厅，前后贯穿整个住宅，形成一个公共活动的中心，与宅中所有的房间都直接或伺接地连通着。这座敞亮的大厅的一头，由两座塔楼的窗户透进阳光，在门的两侧各形成一个小小的方框。另一头，却由一扇让窗帘遮着一部分的凸肚窗照得十分明亮。这种凸肚窗——我们在古书中读到过，深深凹进墙中，而且还有铺了垫子的座位。在这扇窗子的座垫上放着一部对开本的厚书，可能是《英格兰编年史》这一类的大部头著作；正如同时至今，我们还会将一些烫金的书卷散放在室中的桌上，供来客翻阅消遣。大厅中的家具，包括几把笨重的椅子，椅背上精雕着团团簇簇的橡树花，还有一张与椅子配套的桌子，以及一整套伊丽莎白时代的全部设备，说不定还是从更早的年代祖传下来的，由总督从故土运到了这里。桌子上面，为表明英格兰好客的遗风犹存，摆着一个硕大的锡制单柄酒杯，如果海丝特或珠儿往杯里张望的话，还可看见杯底上残存着刚喝光的啤酒的泡沫。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At about the centre of the oaken panels, that lined the hall, was suspended a suit of mail, not, like the pictures, an ancestral relic, but of the most modern date; for it had been manufactured by a skilful armourer in London, the same year in which Governor Bellingham came over to New England. There was a steel headpiece, a cuirass, a gorget, and greaves, with a pair of gauntlets and a sword hanging beneath; all, and especially the helmet and breastplate, so highly burnished as to glow with white radiance, and scatter an illumination everywhere about upon the floor. This bright panoply was not meant for mere idle show, but had been worn by the Governor on many a solemn muster and training field, and had glittered, moreover, at the head of a regiment in the Pequod war. For, though bred a lawyer, and accustomed to speak of Bacon, Coke, Noye, and Finch, as his professional associates, the exigencies of this new country had transformed Governor Bellingham into a soldier, as well as a statesman and ruler.</div>

<div class="line_en">Hester looked, by way of humouring the child; and she saw that, owing to the peculiar effect of this convex mirror, the scarlet letter was represented in exaggerated and gigantic proportions, so as to be greatly the most prominent feature of her appearance. In truth, she seemed absolutely hidden behind it. Pearl pointed upward, also, at a similar picture in the head-piece; smiling at her mother, with the elfish intelligence that was so familiar an expression on her small physiognomy. That look of naughty merriment was likewise reflected in the mirror, with so much breadth and intensity of effect, that it made Hester Prynne feel as if it could not be the image of her own child, but of an imp who was seeking to mould itself into Pearl's shape.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="海丝特出哄孩子高兴的愿望，往里隔了瞧；由于这一凸面镜的特殊功能，她看到红字的映象极为夸张，显得比例极大，成了她全身最显著的特征。事实上，她仿佛完全给红字遮住了。珠儿还向上指着头盔中一个相似的映象，一边向母亲笑着，小脸上又露出了那常有的鬼精灵的表现。她那又调皮又开心的神情，也同样映现在盔甲的凸面镇中，显得益发夸张和专注，使海丝特·白兰觉得，那似乎不是她自已孩子的形象，而是一个精灵正在试图变作珠儿的模样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Pearl, accordingly, ran to the bow-window, at the farther end of the hall, and looked along the vista of a garden-walk, carpeted with closely shaven grass, and bordered with some rude and immature attempt at shrubbery. But the proprietor appeared already to have relinquished, as hopeless, the effort to perpetuate on this side of the Atlantic, in a hard soil and amid the close struggle for subsistence, the native English taste for ornamental gardening. Cabbages grew in plain sight; and a pumpkin vine, rooted at some distance, had run across the intervening space, and deposited one of its gigantic products directly beneath the hall-window; as if to warn the Governor that this great lump of vegetable gold was as rich an ornament as New England earth would offer him. There were a few rose-bushes, however, and a number of apple-trees, probably the descendants of those planted by the Reverend Mr. Blackstone, the first settler of the peninsula; that half mythological personage, who rides through our early annals, seated on the back of a bull.</div>
