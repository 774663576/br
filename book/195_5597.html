<div class="line_en">The Vicar of Blackstable was a dying man. There was no mistaking that when you looked at the hollow cheeks and the shrunken body. He sat huddled in the arm-chair, with his head strangely thrown back, and a shawl over his shoulders. He could not walk now without the help of sticks, and his hands trembled so that he could only feed himself with difficulty.</div>

She washed and dressed him, gave him his food, and was up half a dozen times in the night; for she slept in the next room to his and whenever he awoke he tinkled his little bell till she came in. He might die at any moment, but he might live for months. It was wonderful that she should look after a stranger with such patient tenderness, and it was tragic and pitiful that she should be alone in the world to care for him.</div>

<div class="line_en">In Philip's head was a question he could not ask, because he was aware that his uncle would never give any but a conventional answer: he wondered whether at the very end, now that the machine was painfully wearing itself out, the clergyman still believed in immortality; perhaps at the bottom of his soul, not allowed to shape itself into words in case it became urgent, was the conviction that there was no God and after this life nothing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="菲利普心里有个问不出口的问题。其实问了也是白问，因为他知道伯伯除了那些老一套的答案，其他什么也不会说。他想知道的是，在生命的最后阶段，当身体的所有器官已经损坏大半，伯伯是否还相信灵魂可以永生？也许在他灵魂深处，有些不到万不得已绝不会轻易吐露的想法：上帝是不存在的，人死之后一切都将化为虚无。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It seemed to Philip that the religion which his uncle had preached all his life was now of no more than formal importance to him: every Sunday the curate came and administered to him Holy Communion, and he often read his Bible; but it was clear that he looked upon death with horror. He believed that it was the gateway to life everlasting, but he did not want to enter upon that life. In constant pain, chained to his chair and having given up the hope of ever getting out into the open again, like a child in the hands of a woman to whom he paid wages, he clung to the world he knew.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="菲利普眼里，伯伯这一辈子都在传教布道，可到了临死之际他所信仰的宗教却似乎只沦为形式。每周日牧师上门送来圣餐。他虽常诵圣经，可显然还是对死亡充满恐惧。他虽相信死亡只是通向永生的一道关卡，却并不想进入那样一方天地。尽管病痛缠身，尽管只能终日缚在椅子上站不起身，尽管像孩子一样吃喝拉撒都要靠请来的帮佣，他依然对这个世界恋恋不舍。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">On the evening of Boxing Day Philip sat in the dining-room with his uncle. He had to start very early next morning in order to get to the shop by nine, and he was to say good-night to Mr. Carey then. The Vicar of Blackstable was dozing and Philip, lying on the sofa by the window, let his book fall on his knees and looked idly round the room. He asked himself how much the furniture would fetch. He had walked round the house and looked at the things he had known from his childhood; there were a few pieces of china which might go for a decent price and Philip wondered if it would be worth while to take them up to London; but the furniture was of the Victorian order, of mahogany, solid and ugly; it would go for nothing at an auction. There were three or four thousand books, but everyone knew how badly they sold, and it was not probable that they would fetch more than a hundred pounds. Philip did not know how much his uncle would leave, and he reckoned out for the hundredth time what was the least sum upon which he could finish the curriculum at the hospital, take his degree, and live during the time he wished to spend on hospital appointments. He looked at the old man, sleeping restlessly: there was no humanity left in that shrivelled face; it was the face of some queer animal. Philip thought how easy it would be to finish that useless life. He had thought it each evening when Mrs. Foster prepared for his uncle the medicine which was to give him an easy night. There were two bottles: one contained a drug which he took regularly, and the other an opiate if the pain grew unendurable. This was poured out for him and left by his bed-side. He generally took it at three or four in the morning. It would be a simple thing to double the dose; he would die in the night, and no one would suspect anything; for that was how Doctor Wigram expected him to die. The end would be painless. Philip clenched his hands as he thought of the money he wanted so badly. A few more months of that wretched life could matter nothing to the old man, but the few more months meant everything to him: he was getting to the end of his endurance, and when he thought of going back to work in the morning he shuddered with horror. His heart beat quickly at the thought which obsessed him, and though he made an effort to put it out of his mind he could not. It would be so easy, so desperately easy. He had no feeling for the old man, he had never liked him; he had been selfish all his life, selfish to his wife who adored him, indifferent to the boy who had been put in his charge; he was not a cruel man, but a stupid, hard man, eaten up with a small sensuality. It would be easy, desperately easy. Philip did not dare. He was afraid of remorse; it would be no good having the money if he regretted all his life what he had done. Though he had told himself so often that regret was futile, there were certain things that came back to him occasionally and worried him. He wished they were not on his conscience.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="节礼日那晚，菲利普和伯伯闲坐在客厅。菲利普第二天一早就要出发，赶在九点之前到商场上班。他准备提前和伯伯道别。这位布莱克斯塔布尔的牧师正在打盹，菲利普躺在窗户旁的沙发上，把书盖在膝盖，百无聊赖地环视整个屋子，盘算着屋里的家具能卖多少钱。他在房子里走来走去，看着那些从小就熟悉不过的东西：有几件可能值个好价钱的瓷器，菲利普在想要不要把它们带回伦敦；家具是用桃花心木打的，全都是维多利亚时期的式样，方方正正，样式丑陋，怕是拿去拍卖也卖不了几个钱。书房里还有三四千本书，可大家都知道旧书不值钱，全部加起来也就不过一百镑。菲利普不知道伯伯最后能留下多少钱。他在脑子里算了上百遍，至少要多少钱才够他从医学院毕业拿到学位、再在医院任职一段日子。他看着眼前这个睡得并不安稳的老头儿：那皱巴巴的脸已经没了人形，像某种样子怪异的动物。他心想，用不着费多少力气就能轻而易举地结束这个窝囊的生命。每天晚上，当福斯特夫人给伯伯拿来帮助入眠的药时，他脑子里都会冒出这个念头。家里有两个药瓶，一瓶是伯伯每天定时吃的药，另一瓶是疼得忍不了时才会服用的麻醉剂。福斯特夫人把药倒出来搁在他床边。他每天凌晨三四点服用。把这药剂加倍是再简单不过的事了，这样一来他傍晚就能咽气，也不会有人怀疑什么。因为威格拉姆医生早就预料到他会这样死去，没有丝毫痛苦。菲利普想到自己急需的那笔遗产，握紧了拳头。对这个老东西来说，再苟延残喘地活上几个月是没有任何意义的，而对他来说，这几个月可太重要了。他已经快忍不下去了，每次一想到早上要回林恩公司上班，他就又惊又恐，连连发抖。盘踞在他心头的邪恶想法让他心跳加速，尽管他逼着自己不去多想，可思绪像脱缰的野马怎么也控制不住。仅仅是不费吹灰之力的一个小花招，仅此而已。他对这老东西一点感情都没有，他从不曾喜欢过他。伯伯这一辈子除了自己之外再没考虑过其他人，对深爱自己的妻子冷酷自私，对交由自己抚养的侄儿漠然置之。他有一副铁石心肠，是个愚蠢透顶、不近人情、耽于声色的男人。只需一个不费吹灰之力的小花招啊，仅此而已。可菲利普没有勇气，他怕受到悔恨的追责。如果剩下的大半辈子都要在悔恨中度过，那即便拿到遗产又有什么用呢？尽管他对自己说过成千上万次“后悔是没有用的”，但有些事情无疑会不时浮出脑海，扰得他安宁不得。他不想让自己良心不安。">查看中文翻译</div>

He was frankly horrified at the idea that had come to him, it was murder that he was meditating; and he wondered if other people had such thoughts or whether he was abnormal and depraved.
