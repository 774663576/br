Half a foot taller than Jon, the Braavosi sported a beard as thin as a rope sprouting from his chin and reaching almost to his waist. His robes were a somber purple, trimmed with ermine. A high stiff collar framed his narrow face. "I hope we shall not inconvenience you too greatly."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="银行家脱下帽子，一躬到地。“司令大人。感谢你们的殷勤款待。”他的通用语非常流利，略带一点点口音。这个布拉佛斯人比琼恩高半英尺，蓄着细绳一样的长胡子，从下巴冒出来，几乎吊到腰间。他穿着镶有白鼬皮的暗紫色长袍。高高的硬领衬着他的窄脸。“我希望没有过多地打扰你们。”">查看中文翻译</div>

It is our intent to press on to our new seat at the Nightfort as soon as we are rested. The journey from Eastwatch was wearisome."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你为我们安排房间，真是太感谢了。”王后的用词彬彬有礼，语气却分明在说，这只不过是你该当的职责罢了，如果我对这些房间不满意，我会要你好看。“我不会待太久的。最多几天。我们打算稍事休息就加紧赶到夜堡的居处。一路上从东海望赶到这里，我们都疲倦透了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He did not have to like it, though. And come spring, when the time came to repay all that gold, he would like it even less. Tycho Nestoris had impressed him as cultured and courteous, but the Iron Bank of Braavos had a fearsome reputation when collecting debts. Each of the Nine Free Cities had its bank, and some had more than one, fighting over every coin like dogs over a bone, but the Iron Bank was richer and more powerful than all the rest combined. When princes defaulted on their debts to lesser banks, ruined bankers sold their wives and children into slavery and opened their own veins. When princes failed to repay the Iron Bank, new princes sprang up from nowhere and took their thrones.</div>

If Stannis was not too stiff-necked to accept their terms, the Braavosi would give him all the gold and silver he required, coin enough to buy a dozen sellsword companies, to bribe a hundred lords, to keep his men paid, fed, clothed, and armed.
