<div class="line_en">But what have I done with my life? thought Mrs Ramsay, taking her place at the head of the table, and looking at all the plates making white circles on it. "William, sit by me," she said. "Lily," she said, wearily, "over there." They had that -- Paul Rayley and Minta Doyle -- she, only this -- an infinitely long table and plates and knives. At the far end was her husband, sitting down, all in a heap, frowning. What at? She did not know. She did not mind. She could not understand how she had ever felt any emotion or affection for him. She had a sense of being past everything, through everything, out of everything, as she helped the soup, as if there was an eddy -- there -- and one could be in it, or one could be out of it, and she was out of it. It's all come to an end, she thought, while they came in one after another, Charles Tansley --"Sit there, please," she said -- Augustus Carmichael -- and sat down. And meanwhile she waited, passively, for some one to answer her, for something to happen. But this is not a thing, she thought, ladling out soup, that one says.</div>

<div class="line_en">Raising her eyebrows at the discrepancy -- that was what she was thinking, this was what she was doing -- ladling out soup -- she felt, more and more strongly, outside that eddy; or as if a shade had fallen, and, robbed of colour, she saw things truly. The room (she looked round it) was very shabby. There was no beauty anywhere. She forebore to look at Mr Tansley. Nothing seemed to have merged. They all sat separate. And the whole of the effort of merging and flowing and creating rested on her. Again she felt, as a fact without hostility, the sterility of men, for if she did not do it nobody would do it, and so, giving herself a little shake that one gives a watch that has stopped, the old familiar pulse began beating, as the watch begins ticking -- one, two, three, one, two, three. And so on and so on, she repeated, listening to it, sheltering and fostering the still feeble pulse as one might guard a weak flame with a news-paper. And so then, she concluded, addressing herself by bending silently in his direction to William Bankes -- poor man! who had no wife, and no children and dined alone in lodgings except for tonight; and in pity for him, life being now strong enough to bear her on again, she began all this business, as a sailor not without weariness sees the wind fill his sail and yet hardly wants to be off again and thinks how, had the ship sunk, he would have whirled round and round and found rest on the floor of the sea.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="想到两者间的脱节她扬起了眉毛——她想的是那个，干的是这个一一往外舀汤——她越来越强烈地感到自己是在那漩涡之外；或者说，仿佛一片阴影笼罩，一切失去了色彩，她看到了事物的真实面貌。房间（她环顾四周）很寒酸。没有任何地方是美的。她克制着不去看坦斯利先生。似乎什么也没有融合在—起。他们都各自坐着。全得靠她来做出一切使气氛融洽、引起话题、自由交流的努力。她再一次感到男人的枯燥无能，这是不带任何敌意的事实，因为如果她不这样做就没有人会去做，于是，她像人们去轻轻晃一下一只停摆了的表那样，让自己轻轻一晃，那熟悉的脉博又开始跳动了，就像表又响起了滴答声——一、二、三，一、二、三。她就这样往复循环，倾听着，保护着、照料着这仍很微弱的搏动。就像人们用报纸护住一个微弱的火苗。这时，她向威廉·班克斯弯过身去，默默地对自己说——可怜的人！既无妻子又无儿女，除了今晚之外总是独自在住所吃饭；在对他的怜悯中．生活重又变得有足够的力量支持她前进，她开始尽女主人的职责，就像一个带着几分厌倦的水手看到风鼓起了他的船帆，然而并不愿意再度起航，却在想如果船沉了，他便会旋转着下降，在海底找到安息。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Lily Briscoe watched her drifting into that strange no-man's land where to follow people is impossible and yet their going inflicts such a chill on those who watch them that they always try at least to follow them with their eyes as one follows a fading ship until the sails have sunk beneath the horizon.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莉莉·布里斯柯看着她不知不觉地进入了那片陌生的真空地带，要想追随别人进入其中是不可能的，然而却使看着他们进入其中的人感到心寒，因此他们至少总要试图用眼睛追随他们，就像人们目送一只远去的船．直到船帆消失在地平线下为止。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">How old she looks, how worn she looks, Lily thought, and how remote. Then when she turned to William Bankes, smiling, it was as if the ship had turned and the sun had struck its sails again, and Lily thought with some amusement because she was relieved, Why does she pity him? For that was the impression she gave, when she told him that his letters were in the hall. Poor William Bankes, she seemed to be saying, as if her own weariness had been partly pitying people, and the life in her, her resolve to live again, had been stirred by pity. And it was not true, Lily thought; it was one of those misjudgments of hers that seemed to be instinctive and to arise from some need of her own rather than of other people's. He is not in the least pitiable. He has his work, Lily said to herself. She remembered, all of a sudden as if she had found a treasure, that she had her work. In a flash she saw her picture, and thought, Yes, I shall put the tree further in the middle; then I shall avoid that awkward space. That's what I shall do. That's what has been puzzling me. She took up the salt cellar and put it down again on a flower pattern in the table-cloth, so as to remind herself to move the tree.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她看上去是多么苍老，多么倦怠，莉莉想道，又是多么疏远。然而当她微笑着转向威廉·班克斯时，仿佛船转了个弯，阳光又照到了船帆上，莉莉放下心来，觉得挺有趣地想，她为什么要同情他？因为当她对他说他的信在门厅里的时候，她给人的就是这种感觉。她好像是在说，可怜的威廉·班克斯，仿佛她自身的倦怠部分是出自于对别人的怜悯，而她内在的生命力．她重新生活的决心都是被怜悯所激起的。这不是真的，莉莉心想；这是拉姆齐夫人的错误判断之一，是出于本能、出于她个人而不是别人的某种需要而做出的判断：他根本一点也不可怜。他有他的工作，莉莉对自己说。她像发现了珍宝一样突然想自己也有工作。她眼前闪过了她的那幅画，心里想道，对，我要把树往中间移—点，那样就能避免出现那片别扭的空白，就这么画。这就是一直让我大伤脑筋的问题。她拿起盐瓶，把它放在桌布图案里的一朵花上，以提醒自己把树挪扔地方。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Do you write many letters, Mr Tansley?" asked Mrs Ramsay, pitying him too, Lily supposed; for that was true of Mrs Ramsay -- she pitied men always as if they lacked something -- women never, as if they had something. He wrote to his mother; otherwise he did not suppose he wrote one letter a month, said Mr Tansley, shortly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你信写得多吗，坦斯利先生？”拉姆齐夫人问道，莉莉猜想，她也在可怜他；因为拉姆齐夫人确实就是这样——她总是可怜男人，好像他们——缺乏什么东西——从来不可怜女人，仿佛她们拥有什么东西。他结母亲写信；不然他想一个月连一封信也写不了，坦斯利生生简短地说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">What damned rot they talk, thought Charles Tansley, laying down his spoon precisely in the middle of his plate, which he had swept clean, as if, Lily thought (he sat opposite to her with his back to the window precisely in the middle of view), he were determined to make sure of his meals. Everything about him had that meagre fixity, that bare unloveliness. But nevertheless, the fact remained, it was impossible to dislike any one if one looked at them. She liked his eyes; they were blue, deep set, frightening.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们说的全是些该死的废话。查尔斯·坦斯利心想，一面把勺子放在了已被他一扫而光的汤盘的正当中，莉莉在想（他坐在她的对面，背对着窗，在视域的正当中），他好像决心要把每顿饭都实实在在吃到嘴。他身上的一切都是那么贫乏、一成不变，那么赤裸裸地讨人嫌。但尽管如此，事实仍然是．如果你看着一个人，就几乎不可能讨厌他。她喜欢他的眼睛；这是一以蓝颜色的、深陷进去的、令人生畏的眼睛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For he was not going to talk the sort of rot these condescended to by these silly women. He had been reading in his room, and now he came down and it all seemed to him silly, superficial, flimsy. Why did they dress? He had come down in his ordinary clothes. He had not got any dress clothes. "One never gets anything worth having by post"-- that was the sort of thing they were always saying. They made men say that sort of thing. Yes, it was pretty well true, he thought. They never got anything worth having from one year's end to another. They did nothing but talk, talk, talk, eat, eat, eat. It was the women's fault. Women made civilisation impossible with all their "charm," all their silliness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因为他不想说这些人指望他说的那套废话。他才不会让这些无聊的女人拿一副恩赐的态度来对待他呢。他一直在自己的房间里看书．现在下得楼来，觉得一切都很无聊、浅薄、轻浮。他们干吗要穿上夜礼服来吃饭，他就穿着平时的衣服下来了。他没有什么礼服，“人们从来不能从邮件里收到什么有价值的东西”——这就是他们老是在说的那类话。他们使男人说这一类的话。不错，差不多就是这样，他心里想。他们一年到头从来得不到什么有价值的东西。他们除了聊、聊、聊、吃、吃、吃、什么别的事也不干。都是女人的错。女人以她们的“魅力”、她们的愚蠢，使文明变得难以忍受。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No going to the Lighthouse tomorrow, Mrs Ramsay," he said, asserting himself. He liked her; he admired her; he still thought of the man in the drain-pipe looking up at her; but he felt it necessary to assert himself. He was really, Lily Briscoe thought, in spite of his eyes, but then look at his nose, look at his hands, the most uncharming human being she had ever met. Then why did she mind what he said? Women can't write, women can't paint -- what did that matter coming from him, since clearly it was not true to him but for some reason helpful to him, and that was why he said it? Why did her whole being bow, like corn under a wind, and erect itself again from this abasement only with a great and rather painful effort? She must make it once more. There's the sprig on the table-cloth; there's my painting; I must move the tree to the middle; that matters -- nothing else. Could she not hold fast to that, she asked herself, and not lose her temper, and not argue; and if she wanted revenge take it by laughing at him?</div>

<div class="line_en">She was telling lies he could see. She was saying what she did not mean to annoy him, for some reason. She was laughing at him. He was in his old flannel trousers. He had no others. He felt very rough and isolated and lonely. He knew that she was trying to tease him for some reason; she didn't want to go to the Lighthouse with him; she despised him: so did Prue Ramsay; so did they all. But he was not going to be made a fool of by women, so he turned deliberately in his chair and looked out of the window and said, all in a jerk, very rudely, it would be too rough for her tomorrow.

<div class="line_en">"Yes, take it away," she said briefly, interrupting what she was saying to William Bankes to speak to the maid. "It must have been fifteen -- no, twenty years ago -- that I last saw her," she was saying, turning back to him again as if she could not lose a moment of their talk, for she was absorbed by what they were saying. So he had actually heard from her this evening! And was Carrie still living at Marlow, and was everything still the same? Oh, she could remember it as if it were yesterday -- on the river, feeling it as if it were yesterday -- going on the river, feeling very cold. But if the Mannings made a plan they stuck to it. Never should she forget Herbert killing a wasp with a teaspoon on the bank! And it was still going on, Mrs Ramsay mused, gliding like a ghost among the chairs and tables of that drawing-room on the banks of the Thames where she had been so very, very cold twenty years ago; but now she went among them like a ghost; and it fascinated her, as if, while she had changed, that particular day, now become very still and beautiful, had remained there, all these years.

<div class="line_en">"People soon drift apart," said Mr Bankes, feeling, however, some satisfaction when he thought that after all he knew both the Mannings and the Ramsays. He had not drifted apart he thought, laying down his spoon and wiping his clean-shaven lips punctiliously. But perhaps he was rather unusual, he thought, in this; he never let himself get into a groove. He had friends in all circles… Mrs Ramsay had to break off here to tell the maid something about keeping food hot. That was why he preferred dining alone. All those interruptions annoyed him. Well, thought William Bankes, preserving a demeanour of exquisite courtesy and merely spreading the fingers of his left hand on the table-cloth as a mechanic examines a tool beautifully polished and ready for use in an interval of leisure, such are the sacrifices one's friends ask of one. It would have hurt her if he had refused to come. But it was not worth it for him. Looking at his hand he thought that if he had been alone dinner would have been almost over now; he would have been free to work. Yes, he thought, it is a terrible waste of time. The children were dropping in still. "I wish one of you would run up to Roger's room," Mrs Ramsay was saying. How trifling it all is, how boring it all is, he thought, compared with the other thing -- work. Here he sat drumming his fingers on the table-cloth when he might have been -- he took a flashing bird's-eye view of his work. What a waste of time it all was to be sure! Yet, he thought, she is one of my oldest friends. I am by way of being devoted to her. Yet now, at this moment her presence meant absolutely nothing to him: her beauty meant nothing to him; her sitting with her little boy at the window -- nothing, nothing. He wished only to be alone and to take up that book. He felt uncomfortable; he felt treacherous, that he could sit by her side and feel nothing for her. The truth was that he did not enjoy family life. It was in this sort of state that one asked oneself, What does one live for? Why, one asked oneself, does one take all these pains for the human race to go on? Is it so very desirable? Are we attractive as a species? Not so very, he thought, looking at those he supposed. Foolish questions, vain questions, questions one never asked if one was occupied. Is human life this? Is human life that? One never had time to think about it. But here he was asking himself that sort of question, because Mrs Ramsay was giving orders to servants, and also because it had struck him, thinking how surprised Mrs Ramsay was that Carrie Manning should still exist, that friendships, even the best of them, are frail things. One drifts apart. He reproached himself again. He was sitting beside Mrs Ramsay and he had nothing in the world to say to her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“人们很快就会慢慢疏远开来的。”班克斯先生说，他想到自己毕竟既认识曼宁一家又认识拉姆齐一家，感到几分满足。他并没有疏远开来，他心想，一面放下汤匙，极小心地擦了擦胡子刮得很干净的嘴唇。不过在这方面他可能与众不同，他想，他从不让自己习惯于老一套的生活。他在各种圈子里都有朋友……拉姆齐夫人这时不得不打断谈话，吩咐女仆要保持莱是热的。这就是为什么他喜欢一个人独自吃饭，所有这些干扰都使他不快：哎，威廉·班克斯想，这就是朋友要求你做出的牺牲。他保持着彬彬有礼的举止，只足把左于手指展开放在桌布上，像个技工在空闲的片刻审视一件擦得锃亮待用的工具—样。如果他拒绝来，会伤害她的自尊心。可是对他来说这很不值得。 他看看手，心里想，如果只有他一个人，晚饭现在都快该吃完了；他就可以有时间去工作了。是的，他想，这真是对时间的可怕浪费。孩子们还在陆陆续续地往里走。“我希望你们哪个跑上楼到罗杰的房间去一趟。”拉姆齐夫人说。这一切，他心想，比起另一件事——工作——来是多么琐碎，多么令人厌烦。他坐在这里、手指敲着桌布，而其实他本可以——他在脑子里很快概观了一下他的工作。毫无疑问这真是对时间的浪费！然而，他想，她是我最老的朋友之一。也可算是对她一片忠心。但是现在，此时此刻，她的在场对他毫无意义：她的美貌对他毫无意义；她和小儿子坐在窗口——毫无意义，毫无意义。他只是希望自己一个人呆着，拿起那本书。他感到很不自在；居然能坐在她身旁而无动于衷，他感到对她是种背叛。事实是，他不喜欢家庭生活。—个人正是在这种情况下会问自己，人为什么活着？他会问自己，人为什么要费尽心机使人类延续下去，这真是那么值得去做的事情吗？作为一个物种．我们真有吸引力吗？并不特别如此，他想。一面看着那些挺不整洁的男孩子们。他最喜欢的一个孩子是卡姆，想来已经上床了。愚蠢的问题，自负的问题，一个忙碌的人是从来不会问这种问题的。人类的生活是这样的吗？人类的生活是那样的吗？从来没有时间去想它。可是现在他却在这里问自己那类的问题，就因为拉姆齐夫人在吩咐仆人，也因为拉姆齐夫人对于卡丽·曼宁居然还活着感到这样吃惊，使他突然意识到友谊、即使是最美好的友谊．也是十分脆弱的。人们逐渐疏远。他又一次责备自已，他就坐在拉姆齐夫人身边。却与她无话可说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh," said Mrs Ramsay with a little start, "No," she added, reflecting that she did not know this Carrie who built a new billiard room. But how strange, she repeated, to Mr Bankes's amusement, that they should be going on there still. For it was extraordinary to think that they had been capable of going on living all these years when she had not thought of them more than once all that time. How eventful her own life had been, during those same years. Yet perhaps Carrie had not thought about her, either. The thought was strange and distasteful.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“啊，”拉姆齐夫人微微一惊，说道，“不用了。”她接着说，想起她根本不认识这个建造新弹子房的卡丽。但是多奇怪啊，她重复道，他们竟然还在那儿生活，这使班克斯先生听了觉得挺有趣。真太有意思了，想想他们能够一直在那里住了这么多年，而她居然几乎没有想起过他们。她自己的生活在此期间却是如此丰富多变。也许卡丽·曼宁也并没有想起过她？这个念头很陌生，令人不快。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I'm so sorry," said Mrs Ramsy, turning to him at last. He felt rigid and barren, like a pair of boots that have been soaked and gone dry so that you can hardly force your feet into them. Yet he must force his feet into them. He must make himself talk. Unless he were very careful, she would find out this treachery of his; that he did not care a straw for her, and that would not be at all pleasant, he thought. So he bent his head courteously in her direction.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“真对不起。”拉姆齐夫人终于向他转过身来，说道。他感到僵硬而贫乏，就像一双被水泡过后又变干了的靴子，简直没法伸进脚去。然丽他必须强行把脚伸进去。他必须强使自己说话。如果他不特别小心，她就会发现他对她的这一背叛：发现他对她毫不在意．这会很不愉快，他想。于是他很有礼貌地把头转向她。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"How you must detest dining in this bear garden," she said, making use, as she did when she was distracted, of her social manner. So, when there is a strife of tongues, at some meeting, the chairman, to obtain unity, suggests that every one shall speak in French. Perhaps it is bad French; French may not contain the words that express the speaker's thoughts; nevertheless speaking French imposes some order, some uniformity. Replying to her in the same language, Mr Bankes said, "No, not at all," and Mr Tansley, who had no knowledge of this language, even spoke thus in words of one syllable, at once suspected its insincerity. They did talk nonsense, he thought, the Ramsays; and he pounced on this fresh instance with joy, making a note which, one of these days, he would read aloud, to one or two friends. There, in a society where one could say what one liked he would sarcastically describe "staying with the Ramsays" and what nonsense they talked. It was worth while doing it once, he would say; but not again. The women bored one so, he would say. Of course Ramsay had dished himself by marrying a beautiful woman and having eight children. It would shape itself something like that, but now, at this moment, sitting stuck there with an empty seat beside him, nothing had shaped itself at all. It was all in scraps and fragments. He felt extremely, even physically, uncomfortable. He wanted somebody to give him a chance of asserting himself. He wanted it so urgently that he fidgeted in his chair, looked at this person, then at that person, tried to break into their talk, opened his mouth and shut it again. They were talking about the fishing industry. Why did no one ask him his opinion? What did they know about the fishing industry?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你一定非常厌恶在这么一个嘈杂的场所进餐吧。”她说，拿出了她的社交姿态和用语，她每感心烦意乱时总是这样。就像在会议上因语言引起冲突时，为了取得一致，主席会建议大家都用法语。也许是很蹩脚的法语；也许这法语里没有能表达讲话人的思想的词汇；然而说法语能建立起某种秩序、获得某种一致。班克斯先生用同样的语言回答她，“不，一点也不。”而坦斯利先生对这种语言一无所知，即使说的是单音节词也不懂，但却立刻怀疑这些话说得不诚恳。拉姆齐这家人确实尽谈些无聊的事，他想；他高兴地抓住这个新鲜的例子，可以大做文章了，他要把它记下来．哪天念给一两个朋友听听。在那里，在可以想说什么就说什么的圈子里，他要用讥讽的语气来形容“住在拉姆齐家”的情况，说说他们都谈些多么无聊的话。他会说，这样做上一次是值得的；但是不值得去干第二次。他会说，那些女人真让人厌烦。当然，拉姆齐娶了个漂亮女人生了八个孩子，把自己给毁了。大约就是这么个形容法。但是现在，此时此刻，坐在一张空椅子旁边动弹不得，脑子里还什么也没有成型．只有一些零星的片言只语。他感到很不舒服，甚至连肉体上都不舒服。他希望有人给他个机会来表现自己。这个愿望是如此强烈，使他坐在椅子里感到烦躁不安，看看这个人，又看看那个人，想插入他们的谈话，嘴巴张开了又闭上。他们在谈论捕渔业。为什么没有人问问他的看法？他们对于捕渔业知道些什么？">查看中文翻译</div>
