<div class="line_en">Back when she was still a second-year in college, Ye had already known the professor who would end up being her thesis advisor. He had told Ye that to do astrophysics research, it was useless to excel at theory without knowledge of experimental methods and observational skills -- at least, that was true in China. This was very different from her father's view, but Ye tended to agree with her professor. She had always felt that her father was too theoretical. Her advisor was one of the pioneers of Chinese radio astronomy. Under his influence, Ye developed a great interest in radio astronomy as well. Thus, she taught herself electrical engineering and computer science, the foundation for experiments and observations in the field. During the two years when she was a graduate student, the two of them had tested China's first small-scale radio telescope and had accumulated a great deal of experience in the area. She hadn't expected the knowledge would one day be useful at Red Coast Base.</div>

<div class="line_en">Eventually, Ye was assigned to the Transmission Department to maintain and repair equipment. She quickly became an indispensable part of their operations. Initially, this confused her a bit. She was the only person at the base who wasn't in a military uniform. And given her political status, everyone kept their distance. She had no way to ward off the loneliness other than devoting herself to work. However, this wasn't enough to explain why they relied on her so much. This was, after all, a key defense project. How could the technical staff here be so mediocre that she, who had not majored in engineering and who had no real working experience, easily took over their jobs?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="叶文洁最初在发射部做设备维护和检修，很快成了发射部不可缺少的技术骨千，这让她有些不解。她是基地里唯一不穿军装的人，更由于她的身份，所有人都同她保持距离，这使得她只能全身心投入工作中以排遣孤寂。但这也不足以说明问题，这毕竟是国防重点工程，难道这里的技术人员就那么平庸，非要让她这个非工科出身也没有工作经验的人轻易代替吗？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She learned the reason soon enough. Contrary to appearances, the base's staff was composed of the best technical officers from the Second Artillery Corps. She could study all her life and have no hope of catching up to those excellent electrical and computer engineers. But the base was remote, the conditions were poor, and the main research work of the Red Coast Project was already completed. All that was left was maintenance and operation, so there was little opportunity for achieving any interesting technical results. Most people did not want to be indispensable, because they understood that in highly classified projects like this, once someone was put into a core technical position, it would be very difficult for him to be transferred out. Thus, all of them tried to deliberately hide their technical competence as they went about their jobs. Yet, they couldn't appear too incompetent. So if the supervisor said to go east, they would work hard to move west, purposely playing the fool. Their hope was to put the following thought into the supervisor's head: This man is working hard, but he's limited in his skills. There's no point in keeping him, because he'll only get in the way.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她很快发现了一些原因。与表面看到的相反，基地配备的都是二炮部队最优秀的技术军官，这些卓越的电子和计算机工程师，她再学一辈子可能也赶不上。但基地地处偏僻，条件很差。而且红岸系统的主要研制工作己经结束，只是运行和维护。在技术上也没有什么做出成果的机会，大多数人都不安心工作，他们知道，在这种最高密级的项目里，一旦进入技术核心岗位，就很难调走。所以人们在工作中都故意将自己的能力降低很多，但还不能表现落后，于是领导指挥向东，他就卖力气地向西，故意装傻，指望领导产生这样的想法：这人也尽力了，但就这么点能力和水平，留他没什么用，反而碍手碍脚的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Many really did successfully obtain transfers through this method. Under such conditions, Ye gradually became a key technician at the base. But the other reason that she could achieve this position puzzled her, and for that she could find no explanation: Red Coast Base -- at least the parts that she had contact with -- had no real advanced technology at all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="许多人真的这样成功地调离了。在这种情况下，叶文洁不知不觉中成了基地的技术中坚。但走到这个位置的另一个原因却令她百思不得其解：红岸基地至少在她接触的部分，没有什么真正意义上的先进技术。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Over time, as Ye continued to work at the Transmission Department, the restrictions on her were gradually relaxed, and even the security guard assigned to watch her was called off. She was allowed to touch most components of Red Coast's systems, and could read the relevant technical documents. Of course, there were still areas forbidden to her. For example, she wasn't allowed near the computer control systems. However, Ye discovered that the impact of those systems on Red Coast was far smaller than she had imagined. For instance, the Transmission Department's computers consisted of three machines even more primitive than DJS130.24 They used cumbersome magnetic core memory and paper input tape, and their longest uptime did not exceed fifteen hours. She also saw that the precision of Red Coast's targeting system was very low, probably not even on par with that of an artillery cannon.</div>

<div class="line_en">Commissar Lei said, "Wenjie, by now you're pretty familiar with the transmission system. This is also Red Coast's offensive component, its principal part. Can you give me your views of the system as a whole?" They were sitting at the lip of the steep cliff on Radar Peak, the most secluded spot on the base. The cliff seemed to drop straight off into a bottomless abyss. At first, the spot had frightened Ye, but now she liked to come here by herself.</div>

<div class="line_en">One day, Commissar Lei came to speak with Ye. By this time, Yang Weining and Lei Zhicheng had swapped places in her eyes. During those years, Yang, as the highest-ranked technical officer, did not enjoy a high political status, and outside of technical matters he had little authority. He had to be careful with his subordinates, and had to speak politely even to the sentries, lest he be deemed to have an intellectual's resistant attitude toward thought reform and collaboration with the masses. Thus, whenever he encountered difficulties in his work, Ye became his punching bag. But as Ye gained importance as a technical staff member, Commissar Lei gradually shed his initial rudeness and coldness and became kind toward her.</div>

<div class="line_en">Commissar Lei stood up and paced back and forth. He was so close to the edge of the cliff that it made Ye nervous. "Red Coast is a microwave oven, and its heating targets are the enemy's space vessels. If we can apply microwave radiation at a specific power level of one-tenth of a watt to one watt per square centimeter, we'll be able to disable or destroy many electronic components of satellite communications, radar, and navigation systems."</div>

<div class="line_en">Ye finally understood. Even though Red Coast was only a radio transmitter, that didn't mean it was conventional. The most surprising aspect was its transmission power: as high as twenty-five megawatts! This wasn't just more powerful than all communication transmissions, but also all radar transmissions. Red Coast relied on a set of gigantic capacitors. Because the power requirements were so high, the transmission circuits were also different from conventional designs. Ye now understood the purpose of such ultrahigh power in the system, but something seemed wrong right away. "The emission from the system seems to be modulated."</div>

This convinced Ye that Lei had made a personal decision to tell her about the true purpose of the Red Coast Project. What will happen to him as a result of this decision? As she gazed at Commissar Lei's burly back, Ye felt a wave of gratitude. For her, trust was a luxury that she dared not wish for. Compared to Yang, Lei was closer to her image of a real military officer, possessing a soldier's frank and forthright manners. Yang, on the other hand, was nothing more than a typical intellectual of the period: cautious, timid, seeking only to protect himself.

<div class="line_en">The Monitoring Department had a very sophisticated and sensitive radio receiver. A ruby-based traveling-wave maser25 amplified the signals received by the gigantic antenna, and in order to minimize interference, the core of the reception system was immersed in liquid helium at -269 degrees Celsius.

The first time she entered the main computer room, Ye saw a row of cathode ray tube displays. She was stunned to see programming code scrolling across each of them, and the operators were free to edit and test the code using the keyboard. When she learned programming in college, the source code was always written on the grids of special programming paper, then transferred to paper tape using a typewriter. She had heard of input using a keyboard and screen, but this was the first time she had seen it. The software available astonished her even more. She learned about something called FORTRAN, which allowed you to program using a language close to natural language. You could even type mathematical equations directly into the code! Programming in it was several times more efficient than programming in machine code.

<div class="line_en">"Don't mind him. That's just the way Chief Yang is." Commissar Lei chuckled and shook his head. Then he stared at Ye and his tone became solemn. "Wenjie, when we first brought you to the base, the goal was simple. Red Coast's monitoring systems often had interference caused by electromagnetic radiation from solar flares and sunspots. Fortuitously, we saw your paper and realized that you had researched solar activity. Among Chinese scholars, your predictive model turned out to be the most accurate, so we wanted to ask for your help in solving this problem. But after you came, you showed very strong abilities, so we decided to give you more responsibilities. My thought was this: assign you first to the Transmission Department, then the Monitoring Department. This way, you'd gain a comprehensive understanding of Red Coast as a whole and we could wait and see where to assign you after that. Of course, as you can see, this plan has met with some resistance. But I have trust in you, Wenjie. Let me be clear: Until now, the trust placed in you has been mine, personally. I hope that you can continue to work hard and earn the trust of the organization as a whole."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你别在意，杨总就这样，过分谨慎。有时工作放不开手脚。”雷政委笑着摇摇头，然后直视着文洁，语气郑重起来，“小叶，最初带你来基地，目的很单纯红岸监听系统经常受到太阳斑耀和黑子活动产生的电磁辐射的干扰，我们意外地看到了你的那篇论文，发现你对太阳活动有比较深入的研究，在国内。你提出的预测模型是最准确的，所以就想让你协助解决这个问题。但你来了后，在技术上表现出了很强的工作能力。所以我们决定让你承担更多、更重要的工作。我是这么打算的：让你先到发射部，再到监听部，对红岸系统有一个整体的了解和熟悉，至于以后安排什么工作，我们再研究。当然，你也看到了，这有阻力，但我是信任你的。小叶，这里要说明，到目前为止，这种信任还只是我个人的，希望你能努力工作，最后赢得组织上的信任。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No, no, Wenjie." The commissar held up a hand to stop Ye from speaking. He turned to Yang. "Chief Yang, I'm going to tell you the same thing I did before. This is for work. For Wenjie to perform her duties better, she must be told the purpose of her work."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不不，小叶，”雷政委抬起一只手制止叶文洁说下去，转身对杨卫宁说，“杨总，还是那句话，为了工作，要进一步发挥小叶的作用，她该知道的还是得知道。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That is your right, of course. But do not fret, Chief Yang. I will assume responsibility for all consequences."</div>

<div class="line_en">Lei stood up and strode away in the confident manner of a soldier. Ye's eyes were filled with tears. Seen through them, the code on the screen became flickering flames. This was the first time she had cried since the death of her father.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="雷政委说完站起来，迈着军人的稳健步伐离去。叶文洁的双眼盈满了泪水。透过眼泪，屏幕上的代码变成了一团团跳动的火焰。自父亲死后，这是她第一次流泪。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Commissar Lei placed a hand on Ye's shoulder. She felt the warmth and strength conveyed through it. "Wenjie, let me tell you my sincere hope: One day, I'd like to call you Comrade Ye."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="雷政委把只手放到叶文洁的肩上，她感到了这只有力的手传递的温暖和力量，“小叶啊，告诉你我的一个真切的希望吧：希望有一天，能称呼你叶文洁同志。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As Ye familiarized herself with the work of the Monitoring Department, she discovered that she was far less successful here than at the Transmission Department. The computer science knowledge she had was outdated, and she had to learn the software techniques from scratch. Even though Commissar Lei trusted her, the restrictions on her were severe. She was allowed to view the software source code, for example, but was forbidden from touching the database.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="叶文洁开始熟悉监听部的工作。她很快发现，自己在这早远不如在发射部顺利，她已有的计算机知识早己落后，大部分软件技术都得从头学起。虽然有雷政委的信任，但对她的限制还是很严的，她可以看程序源代码，但不许接触数据库。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On a day-to-day basis, Ye was mainly supervised by Yang. He became even ruder to her, and would get angry at her for the smallest things. Commissar Lei talked to him about it multiple times without effect. It seemed that Yang became filled with a nameless anxiety as soon as he saw Ye.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在日常工作中，叶文洁更多是接受杨卫宁的领导，他对她更加粗暴了，动不动就发火。雷政委多次劝他也没用，好像一见到叶文洁，他就充满了一种无名的焦虑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">One day, the monitoring system intercepted a transmission that, after being deciphered by the computer, turned out to be a few satellite photographs. The blurry images were sent to the General Staff Department's Surveying and Mapping Bureau for interpretation. They turned out to be images of important military targets in China, including the naval harbor at Qingdao and several key factories of the Third Front program.26 Analysis confirmed that these images came from the KH-9 American reconnaissance system. The first KH-9 satellite had just been launched. Although it mainly relied on recoverable film capsules for intelligence gathering, it was also being used to test out the more advanced technique of radio transmission of digital images. Due to the technology's immaturity, the satellite transmitted at a low frequency, which increased its range of reception sufficiently for it to be intercepted by Red Coast. And because it was only a test, the encryption was not very secure and could be broken. The KH-9 was without a doubt an important monitoring target, as it presented a rare opportunity to gather more information about American satellite reconnaissance systems. Yet, after the third day, Yang Weining ordered a change in the frequency and direction of monitoring and abandoned the target. Ye found the decision incomprehensible.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这天，监听系统接收到一系列值得注意的信息，经过计算机译解，发现是几幅卫星照片，很模糊。送到总参测绘局判读。发现均为我境内重要目标，其中有青岛军港和几个大三线重点军工企业的照片。经过分析，确认这些照片来自美国的HK9（KH9？）侦察卫星，第一颗KH9刚刚完成试验发射，主要是以胶片舱回收方式传递情报。但也在进行更加先进的无线电数码传递试验，由于技术不成熟，传送频率较低，所以信息泄漏较大，能被红岸系统接收到。由于是试验传送，加密级别较低，能够被限免，这无疑是最重要的监视对象，是了解美国太空侦察系统不可多得的机会。可是第三天，杨卫宁竟命令转移监听频率和方向，丢开了这个目标，叶文洁总觉得这不可理解。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Gradually, as Ye encountered more and more unexplainable matters in her work, she came to realize that the Red Coast Project was far more complex than she had imagined.</div>

<div class="line_en">As she walked into the office, the scene before her seemed familiar: All the senior officers of the base were present, along with two officers she didn't know. However, she could tell at a glance that they were from higher up in the chain of command. Everyone's icy stares focused on her, but the sensitivity she had developed over the stormy years informed her that she wasn't the one in big trouble today. She was at most a sideshow. She saw Commissar Lei sitting in a corner with a dejected look. He's finally going to pay for trusting me, she thought. At once, she decided that she would do whatever she could to save him. She would take responsibility for everything, even lie if necessary.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="走进办公室后，一个似曾相识的场景出现了：基地的主要领导都在场，还有两名不认识的军官，一看就是更高一级部门来的人，所有人冰冷的目光聚焦到她身上。但这么多年的风风雨雨形成的敏感告诉她，今天倒霉的人可能不是她，她最多是一个陪葬品。她看到雷志成政委坐在一角，神色黯然。他终于要为对我的信任付出代价了，这是叶文洁心中冒出的第一个念头，她在一瞬间暗下决心，为了不牵连到雷政委，一定要将事情向自己身上揽，甚至不惜说谎。但她没有想到第一个开口的竟然就是雷政委，他的话更是完全出乎自己的预料。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Another event also shocked her. Even though she was now in the Monitoring Department, sometimes the Transmission Department still needed her. One time, she accidentally saw the frequency settings for a few upcoming transmissions. She discovered that the designated frequencies for transmissions 304, 318, and 325 were lower than microwave range and could not result in any heating effect in the target.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="另一件事则令她震惊：虽然身在监听部，但发射部有些事情还让她去做。一次，她无意中看到了未来几次发射计划的频率设置，发现在第304、318和325次发射中，确定的发射频率己低出了微波范围，不可能在目标上产生任何热效应。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But Commissar Lei was the first to speak, and what he said was completely unexpected. "Ye Wenjie, I must make it clear at the start that I do not agree with what is about to be done. The decision was made by Chief Engineer Yang after requesting instructions from our superiors. He alone will be responsible for all consequences." Commissar Lei turned to look at Yang, who nodded solemnly. Lei continued, "In order to better utilize your skills at Red Coast Base, Chief Engineer Yang repeatedly requested permission from our superiors to abandon the cover story we've been using with you. Our comrades from the Army Political Department"-- he indicated the two officers Ye didn't know --"were sent to investigate your work situation. Finally, with the approval of our superiors, we've decided to inform you of the true nature of the Red Coast Project."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“叶文洁，首先声明，我是不同意这么做的，下面的决定是杨总工程师请示上级后做出的，他将对后果负完全责任。”说完他看了杨卫宁一眼，后者郑重地点点头，“为了更好地发挥你在红岸基地的作用，这些天来，经过杨总工程师反复向上级请示，兵种政治部派来的同志也了解了你的工作情况，”他指了指那两名陌生的军官，“经过上级同意，我们决定将红岸工程的真实情况告诉你。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Only after a long pause did Ye finally understand Commissar Lei's meaning: He had been lying to her all along.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="过了好半天，叶文洁才明白了雷政委这话的含意：他一直在欺骗她！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I hope you will treasure this opportunity and work hard to redeem your sins. After this, you must behave with the utmost propriety. Any reactionary behavior will be severely punished!" Commissar Lei stared at Ye. He was a completely different person from the image Ye had formed of him. "Are we clear? Good. Now Chief Yang can explain."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“希望你珍惜这次机会。努力工作，立功赎罪。今后，你在基地只许老老实实，不许乱说乱动，任何反动行为都将受到最严厉的惩罚。”雷政委盯着叶文洁厉声说道，与以前叶文洁眼中的他相比仿佛换了一个人，“听明白了吗？那好，请杨总工程师为你介绍红岸工程的情况吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I agree," Ye said, softly, but resolutely. Thus, on this early summer evening, as the wind howled through the giant parabolic antenna, and as the forest rustled over the Greater Khingan Mountains in the distance, Yang Weining explained to Ye Wenjie the true nature of Red Coast. It was a fairy tale for the ages, even more incredible than the commissar's lies.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我同意。”叶文洁轻轻地。但坚定地说。于是，在这个初夏的黄昏，在巨型天线风中的轰鸣声和远方大兴安岭的松涛声中，杨卫宁向叶文洁讲述了真实的红岸工程，这是一个比雷志成的谎言更加令人难以置信的时代神话。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="其他人纷纷离去，办公室中只剩下杨卫宁和叶文洁两人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"If you don't want this, there's still time." Ye discerned the weight behind these words. She now understood Yang's anxiety whenever he had seen her the last few weeks. To make full use of her skills, it was necessary for her to know the truth about Red Coast. However, this choice would extinguish the last ray of hope she had of ever leaving Radar Peak. Once she said yes, she really would spend the rest of her life at Red Coast Base.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“如果你不同意，现在还来得及。”杨卫宁说。叶文洁知道这话的分量，也理解了杨卫宁这些天见到她时的那种焦躁。为了在基地发挥她的才华，必须让她知道红岸工程的真实情况，但这又意味着叶文洁走出雷达峰的最后一线希望也将不复存在。红岸基地将是她一生最终的归宿。">查看中文翻译</div>
