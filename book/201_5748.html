<div class="line_en">Harry spent a lot of the last week of the holidays pondering the meaning of Malfoy's behavior in Knockturn Alley. What disturbed him most was the satisfied look on Malfoy's face as he had left the shop. Nothing that made Malfoy look that happy could be good news. To his slight annoyance, however, neither Ron nor Hermione seemed quite as curious about Malfoy's activities as he was; or at least, they seemed to get bored of discussing it after a few days.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes, I've already agreed it was fishy, Harry," said Hermione a little impatiently. She was sitting on the windowsill in Fred and George's room with her feet up on one of the cardboard boxes and had only grudgingly looked up from her new copy of Advanced Rune Translation. "But haven't we agreed there could be a lot of explanations?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是啊，哈利，我已经承认这有点可疑。”赫敏有点不耐烦地说。她坐在弗雷德和乔治房间的窗台上，两只脚踏着一只硬纸箱，满不情愿地从她那本新书《高级魔文翻译》上抬起目光。“但我们不是一致认为这件事可以有许多种解释吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Maybe he's broken his Hand of Glory" said Ron vaguely, as he attempted to straighten his broomstick's bent tail twigs. "Remember that shriveled-up arm Malfoy had?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“也许他打坏了他的光荣之手西方巫术中的一种护身符，一般取被处以绞刑的人的手用曼德拉草或其他药草缠裹并浸泡而制成。持有该手的人可用它在黑暗中照明，但其他人却看不见。”罗恩一边用力把他扫帚上的弯树枝扳直，一边含糊地嘟囔说，“还记得马尔福的那只干枯的手吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But what about when he said, 'Don't forget to keep that one safe'?" asked Harry for the umpteenth time. "That sounded to me like Borgin's got another one of the broken objects, and Malfoy wants both."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可是他说‘别忘了把那东西替我保管好’，这又是什么意思呢？”这个问题哈利已经问了无数遍。“在我看来，好像那个打坏的东西博金还有一件，马尔福两件都想要。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你是这么想的？”罗恩说着擦去扫帚柄上的灰尘。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"In Madam Malkin's. She didn't touch him, but he yelled and jerked his arm away from her when she went to roll up his sleeve. It was his left arm. He's been branded with the Dark Mark."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“他给博金看了什么东西，我们没有看见，”哈利固执地往下说道，“那东西把博金吓得够呛。我知道那准是黑魔标记——他让博金看清楚是在跟谁打交道，你们看见博金拿他多当回事啊！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ron and Hermione exchanged another look.</div>

On the landing he bumped into Ginny, who was returning to her room carrying a pile of freshly laundered clothes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利很懊恼，但坚信自己是对的。他抓起一堆脏乎乎的魁地奇球袍，离开了房间。这些天，韦斯莱夫人一直在催他们抓紧时间洗衣服和收拾行李，免得临时抱佛脚。在楼梯平台上，他跟金妮撞了个满怀，金妮正要返回她自己的房间，怀里抱着一堆刚洗干净的衣服。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="果然，他一走进厨房，就看见芙蓉坐在桌子旁，滔滔不绝地筹划着她跟比尔的婚礼。韦斯莱夫人守着一堆正在自动削皮的甘蓝，脸上是一副没好气的样子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“啊，哈利！”韦斯莱夫人大声说，打断了芙蓉的长篇独白，“太好了，我正要跟你说说明天去霍格沃茨一路上的安全措施呢。我们又借到了魔法部的汽车，到时候将有傲罗在车站等着——”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Au revoir, 'Any," said Fleur throatily, kissing him good-bye. Ron hurried forward, looking hopeful, but Ginny stuck out her foot and Ron fell, sprawling in the dust at Fleur's feet. Furious, red-faced, and dirt-spattered, he hurried into the car without saying good-bye.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“再见，阿利。”芙蓉用沙哑的喉音说，并亲了一下哈利。罗恩赶紧上前，一脸期待的神情，可是金妮伸出一只脚，把罗恩绊了一跤，使他摔在芙蓉脚边的泥土上。他气得满脸通红，身上沾满了灰尘，连声“再见”也没说，就匆匆钻进了车里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And in fact, their departure the following morning was smoother than usual. The Ministry cars glided up to the front of the Burrow to find them waiting, trunks packed; Hermione's cat, Crookshanks, safely enclosed in his traveling basket; and Hedwig; Ron's owl, Pig-widgeon; and Ginny's new purple Pygmy Puff, Arnold, in cages.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="确实，第二天早晨他们出发时比往常顺利多了。魔法部的汽车开到陋居门前时，他们都已经等在那里了：箱子收拾好了，赫敏的猫克鲁克山安安稳稳地待在它的旅行篮里，海德薇、罗恩的猫头鹰小猪，以及金妮新买的紫色侏儒蒲阿囡，都好好儿地在笼子里关着呢。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes, thank you," said Mrs. Weasley tartly, cutting across Fleur again. "You'd better get on, Harry, I want the trunks ready tonight, if possible, so we don't have the usual last-minute scramble."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是啊，多谢你啦。”韦斯莱夫人尖刻地说，又一次打断了芙蓉的话，“你最好抓紧时间继续收拾吧，哈利。如果可能的话，我希望你今晚就把箱子收拾好，省得像往常那样临走时乱成一团。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was no cheerful Hagrid waiting for them at King's Cross Station. Instead, two grim-faced, bearded Aurors in dark Muggle suits moved forward the moment the cars stopped and, flanking the party, marched them into the station without speaking.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I can walk, thanks," said Harry irritably, jerking his arm out of the Auror's grip.

<div class="line_cn" title="“我自己能走，谢谢。”哈利恼火地说，将胳膊从傲罗手里挣脱出来。他推着手推车朝坚固的挡墙直冲过去，毫不理会那位沉默的陪同。一秒钟后，他就发现自己站在了934站台上，在拥挤的人群那边，鲜红色的霍格沃茨特快列车正在喷着蒸气。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Hermione and the Weasleys joined him within seconds. Without waiting to consult his grim-faced Auror, Harry motioned to Ron and Hermione to follow him up the platform, looking for an empty compartment.</div>

<div class="line_en">"No idea," said Harry, which was not entirely true, though he had no proof yet that his hunch was correct. "Listen," he added, seized by a sudden brain wave, "let's go under the Invisibility Cloak, then we might get a good look at Malfoy on the way, see what he's up to."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不清楚。”哈利说，这并不完全属实，但他还不能证明他的预感是对的。“听我说，”他脑子里突然想到一个好办法，说道，“我们穿着隐形衣去，路上能够仔细观察一下马尔福，看他想做什么。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This idea, however, came to nothing: The corridors, which were packed with people on the lookout for the lunch trolley, were impossible to negotiate while wearing the cloak. Harry stowed it regretfully back in his bag, reflecting that it would have been nice to wear it just to avoid all the staring, which seemed to have increased in intensity even since he had last walked down the train. Every now and then, students would hurtle out of their compartments to get a better look at him. The exception was Cho Chang, who darted into her compartment when she saw Harry coming. As Harry passed the window, he saw her deep in determined conversation with her friend Marietta, who was wearing a very thick layer of makeup that did not entirely obscure the odd formation of pimples still etched across her face. Smirking slightly, Harry pushed on.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，这个办法没有成功。走廊上挤满了等待送餐的人，穿着隐形衣根本没法通过。哈利遗憾地把隐形衣塞进了包里，心想：穿着它躲避人们瞪视的目光倒是个好办法，自从上学期下了火车之后，这种瞪视变得更让他难以招架了。有时同学们还从车厢里匆匆跑出来，就为了好好看他一眼。只有秋·张例外，她一看见哈利过来，就一头扎进了自己的车厢。哈利经过她的窗口时，看见她正煞有介事地跟她的朋友玛丽埃塔聊得起劲。玛丽埃塔化了很浓的妆，但并没有完全遮住那些深深刻在她脸上的奇怪的疹子。哈利暗暗笑了笑，继续往前走。">查看中文翻译</div>

Harry glanced around at their fellow guests. He recognized a Slytherin from their year, a tall black boy with high cheekbones and long, slanting eyes; there were also two seventh-year boys Harry did not know and, squashed in the corner beside Slughorn and looking as though she was not entirely sure how she had got there, Ginny.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="纳威点点头，似乎被吓坏了。斯拉格霍恩做了个手势，他们俩就在最靠近门口的仅有的两个空座位上面对面地坐了下来。哈利扫了一圈其他被邀请的人。他认出了与他同一年级的一位斯莱特林学生，那是一个高个子的黑人男孩，高高的颧骨，长长的眼睛，眼角有些上挑。还有两个哈利不认识的七年级男生，而那个被挤在斯拉格霍恩身边的角落里、一脸茫然、不知道自己为何会在这里的，竟然是金妮！">查看中文翻译</div>

It was Neville's turn next: This was a very uncomfortable ten minutes, for Neville's parents, well-known Aurors, had been tortured into insanity by Bellatrix Lestrange and a couple of Death Eater cronies.

<div class="line_cn" title="“待会儿见！”哈利低声说完，便快步朝沙比尼追去，尽量不发出一点儿声响，其实火车正在哐啷哐啷地行驶，他没有必要这么谨慎。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry seized the door and pushed it open, hard; Zabini, still clinging on to the handle, toppled over sideways into Gregory Goyle's lap, and in the ensuing ruckus, Harry darted into the compartment, leapt onto Zabini's temporarily empty seat, and hoisted himself up into the luggage rack. It was fortunate that Goyle and Zabini were snarling at each other, drawing all eyes onto them, for Harry was quite sure his feet and ankles had been revealed as the cloak had flapped around them; indeed, for one horrible moment he thought he saw Malfoy's eyes follow his trainer as it whipped upward out of sight. But then Goyle slammed the door shut and flung Zabini off him; Zabini collapsed into his own seat looking ruffled, Vincent Crabbe returned to his comic, and Malfoy, sniggering, lay back down across two seats with his head in Pansy Parkinsons lap. Harry lay curled uncomfortably under the cloak to ensure that every inch of him remained hidden, and watched Pansy stroke the sleek blond hair off Malfoy's forehead, smirking as she did so, as though anyone would have loved to have been in her place. The lanterns swinging from the carriage ceiling cast a bright light over the scene: Harry could read every word of Crabbe's comic directly below him.</div>
