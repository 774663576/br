<div class="line_en">And I should like to sleep with Rosey's arms around me, Pate thought. He shifted restlessly on the bench. By the morrow the girl could well be his. I will take her far from Oldtown, across the narrow sea to one of the Free Cities. There were no maesters there, no one to accuse him.</div>

<div class="line_en">He could hear Emma's laughter coming through a shuttered window overhead, mingled with the deeper voice of the man she was entertaining. She was the oldest of the serving wenches at the Quill and Tankard, forty if she was a day, but still pretty in a fleshy sort of way. Rosey was her daughter, fifteen and freshly flowered. Emma had decreed that Rosey's maidenhead would cost a golden dragon. Pate had saved nine silver stags and a pot of copper stars and pennies, for all the good that would do him. He would have stood a better chance of hatching a real dragon than saving up enough coin to make a golden one.</div>

<div class="line_en">"You were born too late for dragons, lad," Armen the Acolyte told Roone. Armen wore a leather thong about his neck, strung with links of pewter, tin, lead, and copper, and like most acolytes he seemed to believe that novices had turnips growing from their shoulders in place of heads. "The last one perished during the reign of King Aegon the Third."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你生得太迟，看不到龙了，小子。”助理学士阿曼告诉鲁尼。阿曼脖子上挂着一根皮绳，串有白、锡、铅和铜的链条，跟大多数助理学士一样，他似乎也认为学徒们肩膀上长的是芜菁，不是脑袋。“最后一头龙在伊耿三世的朝代就死了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Throw the apple," Alleras urged again. He was a comely youth, their Sphinx. All the serving wenches doted on him. Even Rosey would sometimes touch him on the arm when she brought him wine, and Pate had to gnash his teeth and pretend not to see.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“快扔苹果。”拉蕾萨再度催促。这小子生得标致，人称“斯芬克斯”，深得女招待们的喜爱，连萝希也会偶尔在端酒时趁机碰他胳膊一把，佩特只好咬咬牙，假装没看见。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Here." Dragging his clubfoot, Mollander took a short hop, whirled, and whipped the apple sidearm into the mists that hung above the Honeywine. If not for his foot, he would have been a knight like his father. He had the strength for it in those thick arms and broad shoulders. Far and fast the apple flew… but not as fast as the arrow that whistled after it, a yard-long shaft of golden wood fletched with scarlet feathers. Pate did not see the arrow catch the apple, but he heard it. A soft chunk echoed back across the river, followed by a splash.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“来了。”莫兰德拖着畸形的脚轻跳一步，转了一圈，胳膊甩出，将苹果抛向蜜酒河上的雾气之中。若非那只脚，他或许能像父亲一样当骑士。他有粗壮的胳膊和宽阔的肩膀，不缺力量，只见苹果飞得又远又急…却不如后面呼啸而来的那支箭，一码长的金木箭杆上镶着鲜红羽饰。佩特没看到箭射中苹果，但听到了声音。一声轻微的闷响在河面上回荡，紧接着是落水声。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Not half as sweet as Rosey. Pate loved her hazel eyes and budding breasts, and the way she smiled every time she saw him. He loved the dimples in her cheeks. Sometimes she went barefoot as she served, to feel the grass beneath her feet. He loved that too. He loved the clean fresh smell of her, the way her hair curled behind her ears. He even loved her toes. One night she'd let him rub her feet and play with them, and he'd made up a funny tale for every toe to keep her giggling.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="萝希是我的宝贝儿。佩特爱她淡褐色的眼睛，蓓蕾初绽的乳房，还有她每次见到他时微笑的模样。他爱她脸颊上的酒窝。她时而会光着脚，以感受脚下的草地，这点他也很喜欢。他爱她清新的气味，爱她的秀发鬈曲在耳后的样子，甚至爱她的脚趾头。某天晚上，她把脚伸给他摩挲玩弄，于是他替每个脚趾头都编了一个好玩的故事，逗得她咯咯笑个不停。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Perhaps he would do better to remain on this side of the narrow sea. He could buy a donkey with the coin he'd saved, and he and Rosey could take turns riding it as they wandered Westeros. Ebrose might not think him worthy of the silver, but Pate knew how to set a bone and leech a fever. The smallfolk would be grateful for his help. If he could learn to cut hair and shave beards, he might even be a barber. That would be enough, he told himself, so long as I had Rosey. Rosey was all that he wanted in the world.</div>

<div class="line_en">That had not always been so. Once he had dreamed of being a maester in a castle, in service to some open-handed lord who would honor him for his wisdom and bestow a fine white horse on him to thank him for his service. How high he'd ride, how nobly, smiling down at the smallfolk when he passed them on the road…</div>

<div class="line_en">One night in the Quill and Tankard's common room, after his second tankard of fearsomely strong cider, Pate had boasted that he would not always be a novice. "Too true," Lazy Leo had called out. "You'll be a former novice, herding swine."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="直到有天晚上，在“羽笔酒樽”的大厅里，喝下两大杯烈性苹果酒之后，佩特夸口说自己不会永远是学徒。“当然了，”‘懒人’里奥大声说，“你会是个作猪倌的前学徒，哈哈！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He drained the dregs of his tankard. The torchlit terrace of the Quill and Tankard was an island of light in a sea of mist this morning. Downriver, the distant beacon of the Hightower floated in the damp of night like a hazy orange moon, but the light did little to lift his spirits.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他喝干杯中残渣。火炬照耀着“羽笔酒樽”所在的露台，犹如雾海中的光岛。下游远处，参天塔上的烽火漂浮在夜晚氤氲的水汽中，仿佛一轮朦胧魔幻的橙月，却难以提振他的情绪。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The alchemist should have come by now. Had it all been some cruel jape, or had something happened to the man? It would not have been the first time that good fortune had turned sour on Pate. He had once counted himself lucky to be chosen to help old Archmaester Walgrave with the ravens, never dreaming that before long he would also be fetching the man's meals, sweeping out his chambers, and dressing him every morning. Everyone said that Walgrave had forgotten more of ravencraft than most maesters ever knew, so Pate assumed a black iron link was the least that he could hope for, only to find that Walgrave could not grant him one. The old man remained an archmaester only by courtesy. As great a maester as once he'd been, now his robes concealed soiled smallclothes oft as not, and half a year ago some acolytes found him weeping in the Library, unable to find his way back to his chambers. Maester Gormon sat below the iron mask in Walgrave's place, the same Gormon who had once accused Pate of theft.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the appletree beside the water, a nightingale began to sing. It was a sweet sound, a welcome respite from the harsh screams and endless quorking of the ravens he had tended all day long. The white ravens knew his name, and would mutter it to each other whenever they caught sight of him, "Pate, Pate, Pate," until he wanted to scream. The big white birds were Archmaester Walgrave's pride. He wanted them to eat him when he died, but Pate half suspected that they meant to eat him too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="河边的苹果树上，一只夜莺开始歌唱，对于终日听惯了乌鸦的刺耳尖叫和无尽聒噪的佩特而言，真算得上是天籁之音。白鸦们知道他的名字，无论何时，只要看见他，就会彼此嘀咕叫嚷，“佩特，佩特，佩特，”直到他想尖叫。这些大白鸟是沃格雷夫博士的骄傲，沃格雷夫死后想让它们把自己吃掉，佩特怀疑它们也打算吃了他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Perhaps it was the fearsomely strong cider -- he had not come here to drink, but Alleras had been buying to celebrate his copper link, and guilt had made him thirsty -- but it almost sounded as if the nightingale were trilling gold for iron, gold for iron, gold for iron. Which was passing strange, because that was what the stranger had said the night Rosey brought the two of them together. "Who are you?" Pate had demanded of him, and the man had replied, "An alchemist. I can change iron into gold." And then the coin was in his hand, dancing across his knuckles, the soft yellow gold shining in the candlelight. On one side was a three-headed dragon, on the other the head of some dead king. Gold for iron, Pate remembered, you won't do better. Do you want her? Do you love her? "I am no thief," he had told the man who called himself the alchemist, "I am a novice of the Citadel." The alchemist had bowed his head, and said, "If you should reconsider, I shall return here three days hence, with my dragon."</div>

<div class="line_en">Three days had passed. Pate had returned to the Quill and Tankard, still uncertain what he was, but instead of the alchemist he'd found Mollander and Armen and the Sphinx, with Roone in tow. It would have raised suspicions not to join them.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Quill and Tankard never closed. For six hundred years it had been standing on its island in the Honeywine, and never once had its doors been shut to trade. Though the tall, timbered building leaned toward the south the way novices sometimes leaned after a tankard, Pate expected that the inn would go on standing for another six hundred years, selling wine and ale and fearsomely strong cider to rivermen and seamen, smiths and singers, priests and princes, and the novices and acolytes of the Citadel.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oldtown is not the world," declared Mollander, too loudly. He was a knight's son, and drunk as drunk could be. Since they brought him word of his father's death upon the Blackwater, he got drunk most every night. Even in Oldtown, far from the fighting and safe behind its walls, the War of the Five Kings had touched them all… although Archmaester Benedict insisted that there had never been a war of five kings, since Renly Baratheon had been slain before Balon Greyjoy had crowned himself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“旧镇不是全世界。”莫兰德大声嚷嚷。他是骑士之子，此刻已酩酊大醉。得知父亲死在黑水河之后，他便夜夜买醉。唉，即使身处远离战火的旧镇，有重重高墙保护，五王之战还是影响了所有人…不过贝尼狄克博士坚称根本没有所谓的“五王之战”，因为蓝礼·拜拉席恩早在巴隆·葛雷乔伊自封为王之前就遇害了。">查看中文翻译</div>

It took Pate two years to summon up the courage to try again.

Mace Tyrell, Lord of Highgarden and Warden of the South, was Leo's cousin.

Am I still a thief if I put it all back and no one ever knows? It was another question that he had no answer for, like those that Ebrose and Vaellyn had once asked him. When he pushed back from the bench and got to his feet, the fearsomely strong cider all went to his head at once. He had to put a hand on the table to steady himself.

<div class="line_en">When the first shaft of sunlight broke through the clouds to the east, morning bells began to peal from the Sailor's Sept down by the harbor. The Lord's Sept joined in a moment later, then the Seven Shrines from their gardens across the Honeywine, and finally the Starry Sept that had been the seat of the High Septon for a thousand years before Aegon landed at King's Landing. They made a mighty music. Though not so sweet as one small nightingale.</div>

<div class="line_en">He could hear singing too, beneath the pealing of the bells. Each morning at first light the red priests gathered to welcome the sun outside their modest wharfside temple. For the night is dark and full of terrors. Pate had heard them cry those words a hundred times, asking their god R'hllor to save them from the darkness. The Seven were gods enough for him, but he had heard that Stannis Baratheon worshiped at the nightfires now. He had even put the fiery heart of R'hllor on his banners in place of the crowned stag. If he should win the Iron Throne, we'll all need to learn the words of the red priests' song,</div>

<div class="line_en">Pate thought, but that was not likely. Tywin Lannister had smashed Stannis and R'hllor upon the Blackwater, and soon enough he would finish them and mount the head of the Baratheon pretender on a spike above the gates of King's Landing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="佩特心想，然而这种可能性不大。泰温·兰尼斯特在黑水河上打败了史坦尼斯和拉赫洛，很快就能彻底消灭他们，将拜拉席恩篡夺者的脑袋用枪挑着，挂到君临的城门上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As the night's mists burned away, Oldtown took form around him, emerging ghostlike from the predawn gloom. Pate had never seen King's Landing, but he knew it was a daub-and-wattle city, a sprawl of mud streets, thatched roofs, and wooden hovels. Oldtown was built in stone, and all its streets were cobbled, down to the meanest alley. The city was never more beautiful than at break of day. West of the Honeywine, the Guildhalls lined the bank like a row of palaces. Upriver, the domes and towers of the Citadel rose on both sides of the river, connected by stone bridges crowded with halls and houses. Downstream, below the black marble walls and arched windows of the Starry Sept, the manses of the pious clustered like children gathered round the feet of an old dowager.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="夜雾逐渐蒸发，旧镇的景致在他周围显现出来，仿佛逐渐成像的幽灵。佩特没见过君临，但他知道那是座毫无章法的土木城市，到处是泥土街道、茅草房顶和木制小屋。旧镇由石头建成，大街小道都铺着鹅卵石，连最简陋的小巷也不例外，而这座城市最美丽的时刻就是黎明。蜜酒河以西，宫殿般的公会大厅排列于岸。上游，学城的圆顶和塔楼耸立在河的两侧，夹杂于房舍间的石桥连接两岸。下游，繁星圣堂的黑色大理石墙壁和拱窗下，簇拥着主教们的住宅，仿佛孩童聚集在年迈贵妇的脚边。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And beyond, where the Honeywine widened into Whispering Sound, rose the Hightower, its beacon fires bright against the dawn. From where it stood atop the bluffs of Battle Island, its shadow cut the city like a sword. Those born and raised in Oldtown could tell the time of day by where that shadow fell. Some claimed a man could see all the way to the Wall from the top. Perhaps that was why Lord Leyton had not made the descent in more than a decade, preferring to rule his city from the clouds.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="远处，蜜酒河越变越宽，最终注入低语湾，参天塔就位于河口处，其顶端的烽火衬托着拂晓的天空，耀眼夺目。该塔坐落在征战岛的断崖峭壁上，洒下的影子犹如利剑切割了城区，凡是在旧镇土生土长的人都可以凭借影子长短分辨一天的时刻。有人甚至声称，站在高塔顶端，可以一直看到长城—或许这就是雷顿大人十多年不曾下塔的原因，或许他喜欢在云端里统治自己的城市。">查看中文翻译</div>

Dodging from its path, he just avoided being spattered as a townswoman emptied a pail of night soil from a window overhead. When I am a maester in a castle I will have a horse to ride, he thought. Then he tripped upon a cobble and wondered who he was fooling. There would be no chain for him, no seat at a lord's high table, no tall white horse to ride. His days would be spent listening to ravens quork and scrubbing shit stains off Archmaester Walgrave's smallclothes.</div>
