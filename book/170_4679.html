<div class="line_en">"The storm will end today," one of the surviving stableboys was insisting loudly. "Why, it isn't even winter." Theon would have laughed if he had dared. He remembered tales Old Nan had told them of storms that raged for forty days and forty nights, for a year, for ten years… storms that buried castles and cities and whole kingdoms under a hundred feet of snow.</div>

By the time the sky began to lighten the sound of drums had faded away, though warhorns were heard thrice more, each time a little closer. And still the snow fell.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="临冬城已经从睡梦中醒来几个小时了，它的城垛和高塔上挤满了穿着羊毛身披盔甲和皮衣的人，等着似乎永远不会到来的袭击。当天空开始泛白，鼓声也渐渐消失，但是战号声又吹响了三次，一次比一次接近。雪还在下。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He sat in the back of the Great Hall, not far from the horses, watching Abel, Rowan, and a mousy brown-haired washerwoman called Squirrel attack slabs of stale brown bread fried in bacon grease.

<div class="line_en">Lord Ramsay soon appeared as well, buckling on his sword belt as he made his way to the front of the hall. His mood is foul this morning. Theon could tell. The drums kept him awake all night, he guessed, or someone has displeased him. One wrong word, an ill-considered look, an ill-timed laugh, any of them could provoke his lordship's wroth and cost a man a strip of skin. Please, m'lord, don't look this way. One glance would be all it would take for Ramsay to know everything. He'll see it written on my face. He'll know. He always knows.</div>

<div class="line_en">Think that, Theon thought. Believe that. Tell yourself it's true. "Ramsay will use your women as his prey," he told the singer. "He'll hunt them down, rape them, and feed their corpses to his dogs. If they lead him a good chase, he may name his next litter of bitches after them. You he'll flay. Him and Skinner and Damon Dance-for-Me, they will make a game of it. You'll be begging them to kill you." He clutched the singer's arm with a maimed hand.

<div class="line_en">He had come this close to telling them the truth when Rowan had delivered him to Abel in the ruins of the Burned Tower, but at the last instant he had held his tongue.

<div class="line_en">Theon wondered if he would ever see the Drowned God's watery halls, or if his ghost would linger here at Winterfell. Dead is dead. Better dead than Reek. If Abel's scheme went awry, Ramsay would make their dying long and hard. He will flay me from head to heel this time, and no amount of begging will end the anguish. No pain Theon had ever known came close to the agony that Skinner could evoke with a little flensing blade. Abel would learn that lesson soon enough. And for what? Jeyne, her name is Jeyne, and her eyes are the wrong color. A mummer playing a part. Lord Bolton knows, and Ramsay, but the rest are blind, even this bloody bard with his sly smiles. The jape is on you, Abel, you and your murdering whores. You'll die for the wrong girl.</div>

The blade slashed through three of his four chins in a spray of bright red blood. Lady Walda gave a shriek and clutched at her lord husband's arm. "Stop," Roose Bolton shouted. "Stop this madness." His own men rushed forward as the Manderlys vaulted over the benches to get at the Freys. One lunged at Ser Hosteen with a dagger, but the big knight pivoted and took his arm off at the shoulder. Lord Wyman pushed to his feet, only to collapse. Old Lord Locke was shouting for a maester as Manderly flopped on the floor like a clubbed walrus in a spreading pool of blood.

A dozen more were wounded and one of the Bastard's Boys, Luton, was dying noisily, crying for his mother as he tried to shove a fistful of slimy entrails back through a gaping belly wound. Lord Ramsay silenced him, yanking a spear from one of Steelshanks's men and driving it down through Luton's chest. Even then the rafters still rang with shouts and prayers and curses, the shrieks of terrified horses and the growls of Ramsay's bitches. Steelshanks Walton had to slam the butt of his spear against the floor a dozen times before the hall quieted enough for Roose Bolton to be heard.</div>

Lord Bolton unrolled the parchment. "His host lies not three days' ride from here, snowbound and starving, and I for one am tired of waiting on his pleasure.

Theon might never have spotted her but for the way she trembled. Jeyne had pulled the furs up over herself to hide. From us? Or was she expecting her lord husband?

She has thrown herself out a window in despair. But the windows here were shuttered against the storm, sealed up by crusts of blown snow and frost. "Where is she?" Holly asked. Her sisters emptied their pails into the big round wooden tub. Frenya shut the chamber door and put her back against it. "Where is she?" Holly said again. Outside a horn was blowing. A trumpet.

Only a half-gate, he reminded himself. Even if the guards let us pass, there is no way through the outer wall.

And perhaps the old gods were still watching over them; the drawbridge had been left down, to allow Winterfell's defenders to cross to and from the outer battlements more quickly. From behind them came alarums and the sounds of running feet, then the blast of a trumpet from the ramparts of the inner wall.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="席恩一把捂住珍妮的嘴，把她架在腰间跟着另两人，带着她走过了死掉的和垂死的守卫穿过了大门，越过了冰冻的护城河。也许旧神们依旧眷顾他们；吊桥是放下来的，让临冬城的卫队可以跨越，对于外面城垛上的就更快了。他们身后传来警报声还有奔跑的脚步声，接着是内墙上突然爆出的鼓号声。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The fury on Holly's face turned to horror. "Oh, fuck me bloody. The rope." She gave a hysterical laugh. "Frenya has the rope." Then she grunted and grabbed her stomach. A quarrel had sprouted from her gut. When she wrapped a hand around it, blood leaked through her fingers. "Kneelers on the inner wall…" she gasped, before a second shaft appeared between her breasts. Holly grabbed for the nearest merlon and fell. The snow that she'd knocked loose buried her with a soft thump.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="霍丽脸上的暴怒消失了，取而代之的是恐惧。“哦，我这该死的。绳子。”她歇斯底里的大笑。“绳子在弗兰雅那里。”接着她咕噜了一声就抓紧了自己的肚子。一根箭头从她的肠间穿出。当她握着它时，血从她的指缝间滴下。“内墙上有些喽啰…”喘息间，第二只箭矢穿过她的胸膛。霍丽抓着她最近的城齿接着就掉落了下去。那些她碰松的雪轻轻的埋住了她。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Theon was staggering by the time he reached the foot of the stair. He slung the girl over his shoulder and began to climb. Jeyne had ceased to struggle by then, and she was such a little thing besides… but the steps were slick with ice beneath soft powdery snow, and halfway up he lost his footing and went down hard on one knee. The pain was so bad he almost lost the girl, and for half a heartbeat he feared this was as far as he would go. But Holly pulled him back onto his feet, and between the two of them they finally got Jeyne up to the battlements.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="席恩拖着蹒跚的脚来到楼梯下，他将女孩背到肩上开始攀爬。直到这时珍妮才停止挣扎，她还真是个瘦小的东西…但是松软新雪下的台阶覆满了一层滑溜溜的冰，当爬到一半时他一个踉跄狠狠的磕上一个膝盖。疼痛如此剧烈让他差点失手摔下女孩，一瞬间他以为这就是他能走的最远的距离了。但是霍丽拉住了他，他们一起将珍妮抬到了城垛上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On the drawbridge, Frenya stopped and turned. "Go on. I will hold the kneelers here." The bloody spear was still clutched in her big hands.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在护城河上，弗兰雅停下脚步转过身。“你们继续走，我来拖延一下那些喽啰。”她宽阔的手掌里依旧拿着沾血的长矛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As he leaned up against a merlon, breathing hard, Theon could hear the shouting from below, where Frenya was fighting half a dozen guards-men in the snow. "Which way?" he shouted at Holly. "Where do we go now? How do we get out?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当席恩喘着粗气斜靠着一个城齿时，他可以听到下面的叫喊声，冰雪中弗兰雅正与半打的守卫搏斗。“哪条路？”他吼向霍丽。“我们现在该怎么走？我们怎么出去？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Shouts rang out from their left. Jeyne Poole was staring down at Holly as the snowy blanket over her turned from white to red. On the inner wall the crossbowman would be reloading, Theon knew. He started right, but there were men coming from that direction too, racing toward them with swords in hand. Far off to the north he heard a warhorn sound. Stannis, he thought wildly. Stannis is our only hope, if we can reach him. The wind was howling, and he and the girl were trapped.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们的左边想起了呐喊声。珍妮·普尔凝视着下面的霍丽，盖过她的雪逐渐被染成红色。内墙上的十字弓手应该正在重装箭，席恩知道。他看看右边，但是那里也有人赶来，挥舞着剑向他们重来。从更远的北方他听到了战号的响声。史坦尼斯，他不禁想到。史坦尼斯是我们唯一的希望了，若我们能到他那里的话。寒风呼啸，而他和女孩身陷重围。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The crossbow snapped. A bolt passed within a foot of him, shattering the crust of frozen snow that had plugged the closest crenel. Of Abel, Rowan, Squirrel, and the others there was no sign. He and the girl were alone. If they take us alive, they will deliver us to Ramsay.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="十字弓发出尖利的声响，箭在离他一英尺的地方擦过，将塞满炮口的凝固的积雪射的粉碎。阿贝尔、罗文、松鼠还有其他人一点儿消息都没有，他们被孤立了。若被他们生擒，我们会被直接交给拉姆西。">查看中文翻译</div>
