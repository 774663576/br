<div class="line_en">Passatempo was sent with his men to seal off the Bellampo Barracks and immobilize the carabinieri if they ventured out on patrol. Terranova's men controlled the road from Castellammare and Trapani. Corporal Canio Silvestro was on a rooftop with his five best riflemen and a heavy machine gun camouflaged by the bamboo frames used to dry tomatoes into paste that many families used in the town of Montelepre.</div>

<div class="line_en">Don Croce came at twilight in a large Alfa Romeo touring car which parked in front of the house of Hector Adonis. He came with his brother, Father Beniamino, and two armed guards who remained in the car with the chauffeur. Hector Adonis was waiting for them at the door attired even more elegantly than usual in his specially London-tailored gray suit and a red and black striped tie on his dazzling white shirt. He made a startling contrast to the Don, who seemed to be attired even more carelessly than usual, his huge girth girdled by a pair of trousers that made him look like a huge goose waddling, his shirt, collarless and unbuttoned at the neck, and a heavy black jacket that did not even come together at the front, so that you could see the simple white suspenders, an inch wide, that held up the trousers. His shoes were thin slippers.</div>

<div class="line_en">The historic meeting took place two days later. And in that short space of time the town of Montelepre was bursting with rumors that the great Don Croce Malo was coming, hat in hand, to meet with their own glorious hero, Turi Guiliano. How the secret got out was not known. Perhaps it was because Guiliano took extraordinary precautions for the meeting. His patrols moved into position to seal off the Palermo road, and almost fifty of his men who were related by blood to people living in Montelepre went to visit their relatives and stay in their houses overnight.</div>

The furniture was from France and the paintings had been bought carefully from minor living artists of Italy.

<div class="line_en">Don Croce felt absolutely secure. He knew that Guiliano would not dishonor his godfather by betraying his word. The Don was filled with a pleasurable anticipation. He would now meet and judge for himself the true greatness of this rising star. And yet even he was a little startled at how quietly Guiliano slipped into the house. There was no sound out in the cobbled street, no sound of a door opening or being shut. But suddenly Guiliano was standing in the archway that led to the dining room. Don Croce was struck by his handsomeness.</div>

<div class="line_en">And then even as Don Croce doubted him, Turi Guiliano did something that gladdened the Don's heart and reassured him that he was right to make this boy his ally. He came into the room and advanced directly to Don Croce and said, "Bacio tua mano."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在唐·克罗切还在怀疑的时候，图里·吉里安诺做了一件使克罗切内心特别高兴的事，并使他觉得把这个年轻人看作盟友是正确的。吉里安诺走进来之后，直接走到唐·克罗切面前说：“请允许我吻你的手。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Could such a boy have defied Rome, outwitted the Friends of the Friends, inspired devotion in the murderous Andolini, kept in check the brutishness of Passatempo, conquered a quarter of Sicily and the love of the people of the whole island? Don Croce knew that Guiliano was incredibly brave, but Sicily was full of brave men who had gone to early graves, easy prey to treacheries.</div>

<div class="line_en">Life in the mountains had broadened his chest and slimmed down his face. It was still oval and yet the cheeks were lean, the chin pointed. There were the statuelike eyes, golden brown with their curious circle of silver that seemed to embed the eyeballs into their sockets. His clothes too set him off to advantage -- the moleskin trousers snug, a white shirt freshly washed and ironed. He wore a hunting jacket of russet velvet, loose, underneath which was slung a machine pistol he always carried. Above all he looked incredibly young, no more than a boy, though his age was twenty-four.</div>

<div class="line_en">Pisciotta came through the archway and watched this with a small smile on his saturnine face. His handsomeness too was remarkable but in direct contrast to Guiliano. The illness of his lungs had thinned his body and his features. The bones of his face seemed to press outward against his olive skin. His hair was carefully combed and sleekly black whereas Guiliano wore his tawny hair closely cropped as if it were a helmet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时从拱形走廊中走过来的皮肖塔看见了这一幕，严肃的脸上露出了微微笑意。他也是一表人才，英俊出众，但是与吉里安诺的外貌截然不同。由于患有肺病，他的身材和面庞都很瘦。他的皮肤泛着橄榄色，脸上的骨骼显得更加突出。他的头发乌黑油亮，是经过仔细梳理的。而吉里安诺的棕色头发修剪得很短，就像戴着一顶头盔。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was the traditional Sicilian peasant greeting to a man of higher rank -- a priest, a landowner or a noble. "I kiss your hand." And Guiliano had a cheerful grin on his face. But Don Croce knew exactly why he had said it. It was not to show his subservience to the Don or even in respect for his age. It was said because the Don had put himself in Guiliano's power and Guiliano was showing respect for the trust. Don Croce rose slowly, his heavy cheeks becoming darker with the effort of rising. He took Guiliano in his arms. This was a noble young man and he wanted to show his affection. As he did so he could see the face of Hector Adonis beaming proudly -- his godson had shown himself a gentleman.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是西西里农民对地位比自己高的人——神父、地主或者贵族——传统的打招呼方式。吉里安诺脸上露出愉快的笑容。不过唐·克罗切清楚地知道吉里安诺为什么要说这句话。这不是为了恭维他这位龙头老大，也不是尊重他这把年纪，而是因为克罗切把自己置身于吉里安诺的地盘，而吉里安诺是对他的信任表示尊敬。唐·克罗切慢慢地站起身，由于这一动作，他那肉嘟嘟的面颊上的颜色变深了。他把吉里安诺拥在自己的怀里。这是一个高尚的年轻人，他想表达对他的爱慕。与此同时他看见赫克特·阿多尼斯的脸上露出得意的笑容——他的教子表现得很有教养。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As for Turi Guiliano, he had expected to take the Don by surprise with his greeting and had been surprised in his turn by the Don's complete understanding and graceful affectionate acceptance. He studied the huge hulk of Don Croce and became even more alert. This was a dangerous man. Not only by reputation but by the aura of power around him. The bulk of his body, which should have been grotesque, seemed to give off a heated energy; it filled the room. And when the Don spoke, the voice coming from that massive head had almost the magic of choral music. There was an extraordinary fascination about him when he set out to convince that was a combination of sincerity, forcefulness and exquisite courtesy which was strange in a man who seemed so uncouth in everything else he did.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="图里·吉里安诺料到这样打招呼会使唐·克罗切感到惊讶，不过他自己也很惊异，因为对方完全理解并且彬彬有礼地表示接受。吉里安诺打量着唐·克罗切魁梧的身躯，内心变得更加警觉。这是一个危险人物，不仅是因为他的名声，还有他强悍的样子。他那本该丑陋不堪的大块头身材，似乎散发着热量，这种能量充斥了整个房间。他开口说话的时候，从那硕大的脑袋中发出的声音具有近乎和声的魔力。他开始说服对方的时候也很吸引人，这种结合了真诚、说服力和礼仪的做法在一个做其他事都粗暴无礼的人身上显得异乎寻常。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Don Croce nodded and proceeded to explain the agreement that he had come to with Minister Trezza. That if Guiliano helped "educate" the populace of Sicily to vote properly in the next elections, then a way would be found for a pardon. Guiliano could return to his family as an ordinary citizen and no longer be a bandit. As evidence of the reality of this agreement, Minister Trezza had given the plans for the fight against Guiliano to the Don. The Don raised a hand in the air to emphasize his next point. "If you agree, these plans will be vetoed by the Minister. There would be no army expedition or extra thousand carabinieri sent to Sicily."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="唐·克罗切点点头，开始解释他和特雷扎部长达成的协议。如果吉里安诺帮助“教育”西西里民众在下次大选中正确投票，那么就能找到一个赦免他的途径。吉里安诺可以回到自己家中当一名普通老百姓，不再做土匪。特雷扎部长把进攻吉里安诺的作战计划交给他，这本身就证明了这项协议的真实性。克罗切把一只手举起来，强调他要说的下一个问题。“如果你同意，部长就将否决这些计划。这样就不会有军队的行动，也不会向西西里增派一千名宪兵。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Don Croce saw that Guiliano was listening attentively but did not seem surprised by all this. He went on. "Everyone in Sicily knows your concern for the poor. One might think that you would support the leftist parties. But I know of your belief in God, you are after all a Sicilian. And who does not know of your devotion to your mother? Do you really want Communists running Italy? What would happen to the Church? What would happen to the family? The young men of Italy and Sicily who fought in the war are infected by foreign beliefs, political doctrines that have no place in Sicily. Sicilians can find their own way to a better fate. And do you really want an all-powerful state that would brook no rebelliousness from its citizens? A left-wing government would surely mount a major campaign against both of us, for are we not the true rulers of Sicily? If the leftist parties win the next election, the day might come when there are Russians in the villages of Sicily deciding who might go to church. Our children would be made to go to schools that would teach them that the state comes before the sacred mother and father. What is worth that? No. Now is the time for every true Sicilian to defend his family and his honor against the state."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="唐·克罗切看出吉里安诺在全神贯注地听，但对这一切似乎并不感到惊讶。他继续说下去：“西西里的每个人都知道你关心穷人的疾苦。有人也许认为你会支持左翼政党。但是我听说你信仰上帝，因为你毕竟是个西西里人。谁不知道你对母亲的一片孝心？难道你真的希望共产党人治理意大利吗？那样一来教会怎么办，家族怎么办？参加过战争的意大利和西西里的年轻人都受到外国信仰的影响，可是那样的政治说教在西西里是没有市场的。西西里人能找到一条自己的道路，争取更好的命运。你真的希望有一个不允许公民有叛逆意识的强权国家吗？一个左翼政府肯定会发动针对我们两个人的大规模军事行动，因为我们是西西里的真正统治者，难道不是吗？如果左翼政党赢得下一次大选，有朝一日可能会出现的情况是，俄国人来到西西里的村庄，来决定谁可以去教堂。我们的孩子们会被迫去学校学习，而学校里会教他们：摆在第一位的不是我们神圣的父母，而是国家。那样值得吗？不。现在到了每个真正的西西里人奋起对抗国家、保卫自己的家庭和荣誉的时候了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

Why had he called attention to himself at this moment? Why had he wanted the Don to notice him? Don Croce wondered if this man might be put to some use. With his unerring instinct he smelled a rottenness in this most trusted lieutenant of Guiliano. Perhaps it was the lung disease, perhaps the cynicism of mind. Pisciotta was a man who could never trust anyone completely and was therefore a man who by definition could not be trusted by anyone completely. Don Croce turned all this over before he spoke to answer.</div>

But I know that is not enough. Allow me to do you a service that will gladden my heart and bring joy to your mother and father.

<div class="line_en">"No," Guiliano said. "Keep the pass. It will be useful to us. And another thing. That may look like Trezza's signature, but of course it's not. It's a forgery. If it suits their purpose they can deny the pass is legitimate. Or if it suits their purpose they can say certainly it's in order and produce records that the pass was authorized by Trezza. If they claim it's a forgery they just destroy the records."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，”吉里安诺说，“留着这张通行证。它会对我们有用的。还有一件事。这个签名看起来像是特雷扎的，但它肯定不是。是伪造的。在必要的时候，他们会不承认这张通行证的合法性。假如它还符合他们的目的，他们肯定会说它是记录在案的，还会拿出登记来说明它是由特雷扎签发的。如果他们说这是伪造的，他们就会把记录销毁。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Guiliano considered this. Aspanu had always been cynical, and a little greedy too. They had quarreled a few times about the spoils of some robberies, Pisciotta urging a larger share for members of the band.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉里安诺陷入沉思。阿斯帕努总是愤世嫉俗，而且有些贪婪。他们为分赃的问题争吵过，皮肖塔极力主张他们手下的成员要多分一点。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Pisciotta recognized the truth of this. With each day he felt a growing amazement that Guiliano who was so open and honest in his feelings could fathom the twisted schemes of his enemies. He realized that at the root of Guiliano's romanticism was the brilliant penetration of paranoia.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="皮肖塔悟出了其中的道理。他觉得他对吉里安诺要越发另眼相看了，因为吉里安诺不仅坦率、正直，而能够看透敌人的阴谋。他意识到吉里安诺浪漫主义的根基是偏执狂的出色的洞察力。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"We have no choice," Guiliano said. "The Communists will never give me amnesty if they win control of the government. Right now the Christian Democrats and Minister Trezza and the Cardinal of Palermo and of course Don Croce must be our friends and comrades in arms. We must neutralize the Communists, that's the most important thing. We'll meet with Don Croce and settle the matter." He paused and patted Pisciotta's shoulder. "You did well to get the Cardinal's note. And the pass will be useful."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们别无选择，”吉里安诺说，“如果共产党人控制了政府，他们绝对不会对我们实行大赦。目前，基督教民主党、特雷扎部长、巴勒莫的红衣主教，当然还有唐·克罗切，必须是我们的朋友和战友。我们必须挫败共产党人，这是首当其冲的事。我们要和唐·克罗切会面来解决这个问题。”他顿了顿，拍拍皮肖塔的肩膀，“你让红衣主教写了条子，这干得很好。这张通行证将来也有用。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But Pisciotta was not convinced. "We'll do their dirty work for them," he said. "And then we'll hang around like beggars waiting for their pardon. I don't believe any of them -- they talk to us as if we were foolish girls, promising us the world if we get into bed with them. I say we fight for ourselves, keep the money we make with our work instead of distributing it to the poor. We could be rich and live like kings in America or Brazil. That's our solution and then we won't have to count on those pezzonovanti."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是皮肖塔并没有心悦诚服。“我们替他们干那种勾当，”他说，“然后让我们像叫花子一样乞求，等待他们的赦免。对他们我是一个也不相信——他们跟我们说话的时候，把我们当成傻乎乎的女孩儿，如果我们同意和他们上床，他们就把世界许诺给我们。我说我们要为自己而战斗，把我们得来的钱留着，不要分给穷人。我们可以变得很富有，到美国或者巴西过国王一样的生活。这就是我们的解决办法，那样我们也就没有必要指望这些达官显贵了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Guiliano decided to explain exactly how he felt. "Aspanu," he said, "we must gamble on the Christian Democrats and Don Croce. If we win and gain our pardon, the people of Sicily will elect us to lead them. We'll win everything." Guiliano paused for a moment and smiled at Pisciotta. "If they play us false, neither you nor I will faint with surprise. But how much will we have lost? We must fight the Communists in any case; they are more our enemies than the Fascists. And so their doom is certain. Now, listen to me carefully. You and I think alike. The final battle will be after we defeat the Communists and must take arms against the Friends of the Friends and Don Croce."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉里安诺决定把自己的想法如实相告。“阿斯帕努，”他说，“我们必须把赌注压在基督教民主党和唐·克罗切身上。如果我们赢了并且获得赦免，西西里人民将选举我们来领导他们。我们就将赢得一切。”吉里安诺停下来，朝皮肖塔笑了笑，“如果他们愚弄我们，我们也不会怎么样。我们能有多大的损失呢？现在，你仔细听我说。你我二人的想法是一样的。我们最终的敌人是友中友和唐·克罗切。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">All during the voyage to see Minister Trezza and the Cardinal, Don Croce had been his constant companion. They had eaten dinner together every night, and the Don had discoursed on the future of Sicily, the troublesome times to come. It had taken some time for Pisciotta to realize that the Don was courting him, trying to win him over to some sympathy for the Friends of the Friends, and in a very subtle way attempting to convince Pisciotta that perhaps, like Sicily, his own future might be rosier with the Don than with Guiliano. Pisciotta had given him no sign that he understood these messages. But it made him more worried about the Don's good faith. He had never before been in fear of any man, except perhaps Turi Guiliano. But Don Croce, who had spent his whole life acquiring that "respect" which is the badge of a great Mafia chief, inspired in him a sense of dread. What he realized now was that he feared the Don would outwit and betray them and that someday they would lie with their faces in the dust.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在去见特雷扎部长和红衣主教的途中，唐·克罗切一直陪着他。每天晚上他们都在一起用餐，唐·克罗切跟他谈了西西里的未来和将要面临的麻烦。过了一段时间，皮肖塔才意识到唐·克罗切是想博得他的好感，想争取他对友中友的好感，巧妙地试图让他相信，唐·克罗切能够给他一个更好的未来。皮肖塔明白对方的用意，但他却丝毫不露声色。不过他对唐·克罗切的好意不太放心。除了图里·吉里安诺之外，他还从来没有害怕过任何人。唐·克罗切一生都在努力获取别人的“尊敬”，因为这是黑手党首领的象征，他使皮肖塔心生恐惧。他担心的唐比他们都要狡猾，而且会出卖他们，有朝一日他们将会死无葬身之地。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Guiliano, though he smiled, was thoughtful. He knew Pisciotta liked the life of an outlaw. It fitted his character, and though he was quick-witted and cunning, he did not have imagination. He could not make a jump into the future and see the inescapable fate that awaited them as outlaws.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽然吉里安诺面带微笑，但却在认真思考。他知道皮肖塔喜欢这种流亡的生活。这非常适合他的个性，虽然他非常机敏狡猾，但是缺乏想象力。他不可能高瞻远瞩，看不清当土匪的必然下场正等着他们。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Later that night, Aspanu Pisciotta sat on the edge of the cliff and tried to smoke a cigarette. But a sharp pain in his chest made him stub it out and put the butt in his pocket. He knew his tuberculosis was getting worse, but he also knew that if he rested in the mountains for a few weeks, he would feel better. What worried him was something he had not told Guiliano.</div>
