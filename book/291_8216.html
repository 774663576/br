Instead of a dead donkey, he saw a very much alive Marionette, wriggling and squirming like an eel.

One day I was about to become a boy, a real boy, but on account of my laziness and my hatred of books, and because I listened to bad companions, I ran away from home. One beautiful morning, I awoke to find myself changed into a donkey -- long ears, gray coat, even a tail! What a shameful day for me! I hope you will never experience one like it, dear Master. I was taken to the fair and sold to a Circus Owner, who tried to make me dance and jump through the rings. One night, during a performance, I had a bad fall and became lame. Not knowing what to do with a lame donkey, the Circus Owner sent me to the market place and you bought me."</div>

What great bites they took! One ate my ears, another my nose, a third my neck and my mane. Some went at my legs and some at my back, and among the others, there was one tiny fish so gentle and polite that he did me the great favor of eating even my tail."</div>

<div class="line_en">"I think as you do," answered the Marionette, laughing. "Still, you must know that when the fish finished eating my donkey coat, which covered me from head to foot, they naturally came to the bones -- or rather, in my case, to the wood, for as you know, I am made of very hard wood. After the first few bites, those greedy fish found out that the wood was not good for their teeth, and, afraid of indigestion, they turned and ran here and there without saying good-by or even as much as thank you to me. Here, dear Master, you have my story. You know now why you found a Marionette and not a dead donkey when you pulled me out of the water."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我的想法跟您一样，”木偶笑着回答，“我再给您说，等到这些鱼吃光我身上从头到脚的皮和肉，自然就吃到我的骨头…或者说是正确点，吃到我的木头，因为您知道，我是很硬很硬的木头做的。可是咬了几口，这些馋嘴鱼马上发觉木头咬不动，对这种不消化的东西感到恶心，它们连一句谢谢也没跟我说，就各走各的了…您抓住绳子拉上来的为什么是个活木偶而不是一头死驴子，我算是都给您讲了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Pinocchio's heart beat fast, and then faster and faster. He redoubled his efforts and swam as hard as he could toward the white rock. He was almost halfway over, when suddenly a horrible sea monster stuck its head out of the water, an enormous head with a huge mouth, wide open, showing three rows of gleaming teeth, the mere sight of which would have filled you with fear.</div>

Only for a moment, however, for the Shark took a deep breath and, as he breathed, he drank in the Marionette as easily as he would have sucked an egg. Then he swallowed him so fast that Pinocchio, falling down into the body of the fish, lay stunned for a half hour.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是太迟了！怪物已经追上他，怪物深深地一吸，就像吸鸡蛋似的，把可怜的木偶吸到嘴里。它狼吞虎咽地把皮诺乔吞下去，皮诺乔一下子到了鲨鱼肚子里，狠狠撞了一下，整整有一刻钟昏昏迷迷，的不省人事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When he recovered his senses the Marionette could not remember where he was. Around him all was darkness, a darkness so deep and so black that for a moment he thought he had put his head into an inkwell. He listened for a few moments and heard nothing. Once in a while a cold wind blew on his face. At first he could not understand where that wind was coming from, but after a while he understood that it came from the lungs of the monster. I forgot to tell you that the Shark was suffering from asthma, so that whenever he breathed a storm seemed to blow.</div>
