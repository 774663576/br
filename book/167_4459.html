<div class="line_en">He splashed some tepid water on his face from the basin beside his bed and took his time squatting in the garderobe, the night air cold on his bare skin. Ser Lancel was sixteen, and not known for his patience. Let him wait, and grow more anxious in the waiting. When his bowels were empty, Tyrion slipped on a bedrobe and roughed his thin flaxen hair with his fingers, all the more to look as if he had wakened from sleep.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他用床边脸盆里的温水湿了湿脸，不紧不慢地蹲在厕所，夜间的空气让他裸露的皮肤有些凉。蓝赛尔爵士年方十六，从没什么耐性，就让他等着吧，他会越来越焦躁。提利昂清空肠子，套上一件睡袍，并用手指将稀疏的亚麻色头发揉乱，好让自己看上去像是刚刚醒来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was well past midnight, he judged from the black outside the window. Does Lancel think to find me drowsy and slow of wit at this hour? he wondered. No, Lancel scarce thinks at all, this is Cersei's doing. His sister would be disappointed. Even abed, he worked well into the morning -- reading by the flickering light of a candle, scrutinizing the reports of Varys's whisperers, and poring over Littlefinger's books of accounts until the columns blurred and his eyes ached.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从窗外的天色判断，应该过了午夜时分。莫非蓝赛尔以为这时候我就会迷迷糊糊，反应迟钝么？他心里盘算。不，蓝赛尔根本不动脑子，这一定是瑟曦的主意。可惜，老姐要失望了。他每晚都把工作带到床上，一直干到凌晨——在摇曳的烛光下，仔细审查瓦里斯的秘密报告，查阅小指头的账簿，直到眼睛发疼，字迹模糊为止。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The rushes were scratchy under the soles of his bare feet. "My cousin chooses a queer hour to come visiting," Tyrion told a sleep-befuddled Podrick Payne, who'd doubtless expected to be well roasted for waking him. "See him to my solar and tell him I'll be down shortly."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="草席刺得他赤裸的脚底发痒。“堂弟真会挑时机，”提利昂告诉睡得迷迷糊糊的波德瑞克·派恩，这孩子无疑以为深夜唤醒他，会遭一顿训斥。“带他到书房，告诉他，我马上下来。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Lancel was pacing before the ashes of the hearth, garbed in slashed red velvet with black silk undersleeves, a jeweled dagger and a gilded scabbard hanging from his swordbelt. "Cousin," Tyrion greeted him. "Your visits are too few. To what do I owe this undeserved pleasure?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="蓝赛尔在烧成灰烬的壁炉前踱步，身穿有黑丝绸内袖的红天鹅绒斜纹外衣，佩一柄镶珠宝的匕首，刀鞘镀金。“堂弟！”提利昂跟他打招呼，“你真是稀客。请问有何贵干呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Her Grace is quite recovered," Ser Lancel said curtly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“太后陛下业已康复，”蓝赛尔简略地说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"So it is." Tyrion waved it away. "I hope my sister is not overtaxing her strength, so soon after her illness. It would be a great pity if she were to suffer a relapse."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“原来如此，”提利昂挥手要他拿开。“唉，姐姐大病初愈，我衷心地希望她不要过度操劳。倘若病情复发，那就太遗憾了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Her Grace the Queen Regent has sent me to command you to release Grand Maester Pycelle." Ser Lancel showed Tyrion a crimson ribbon, bearing Cersei's lion seal impressed in golden wax. "Here is her warrant."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“摄政太后陛下命我前来，要你即刻释放派席尔大学士。”蓝赛尔爵士拿出一条猩红的缎带，金蜡上摁有瑟曦的狮印。“这是陛下的授权状。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Music to my ears." Though not a tune I'm fond of. I should have given her a larger dose. Tyrion had hoped for a few more days without Cersei's interference, but he was not too terribly surprised by her return to health. She was Jaime's twin, after all. He made himself smile pleasantly. "Pod, build us a fire, the air is too chilly for my taste. Will you take a cup with me, Lancel? I find that mulled wine helps me sleep."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“妙极了，”尽管不是我喜欢的曲调。我当初真该多下点剂量。提利昂本希望能多几天不受瑟曦的干涉，但对她迅速恢复健康也没吃惊。毕竟，她是詹姆的孪生姐姐。他做出一个愉快地笑容。“波德，替我们生个火，这里实在太凉。陪我喝一杯如何，蓝赛尔？我发现温酒有助于睡眠呢。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Knighthood had made the boy bolder, Tyrion reflected -- that, and the sorry part he had played in murdering King Robert. "Wine does have its dangers." He smiled as he poured. "As to Grand Maester Pycelle… if my sweet sister is so concerned for him, I would have thought she'd come herself. Instead she sends you. What am I to make of that?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哟，骑士称号让这小子肆无忌惮，提利昂寻思——还有他在谋杀劳勃国王一事中扮演的可悲角色。“酒喝多了自然伤身。”他一边倒酒一边微笑，“至于派席尔大学士…如果我亲爱的姐姐真那么在乎他，似乎该亲自前来，但她却派了你。对此，我怎么理解呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Perhaps you ought write that down so I'll remember it better." The fire was crackling merrily. "You may leave us, Pod," Tyrion told his squire. Only when the boy was gone did he turn back to Lancel. "There is more?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“或许你该把这写下来，以免我记不住。”炉火欢快地噼啪作响。“你可以下去了，波德，”提利昂告诉他的侍从。等孩子离开之后，他方才转身面对蓝赛尔。“还有什么事？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The Hand serves," the young knight informed him airily. "The regent rules until the king is of age."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Make of it what you will, so long as you release your prisoner. The Grand Maester is a staunch friend to the Queen Regent, and under her personal protection." A hint of a sneer played about the lad's lips; he was enjoying this. He takes his lessons from Cersei. "Her Grace will never consent to this outrage. She reminds you that she is Joffrey's regent."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“随你怎么理解，我只要你放人！国师是摄政太后坚定的盟友，处于她的保护之下。”这小子唇边浮现一抹冷笑，似乎很得意。想必这套都是跟瑟曦学的。“陛下决不容许这种暴行发生。她要我提醒你，她才是乔佛里的摄政王。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“爵士！”蓝赛尔硬邦邦地说。他碰了碰剑，或许想提醒提利昂，他也有武器。“跟我说话小心点，小恶魔。”无疑他想作势威胁，但那簇可笑的小胡子毁了效果。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Tyrion allowed himself a moment to feel sorry for the boy. Another fool, and a weakling as well, but he does not deserve what Cersei and I are doing to him. It was a kindness that his uncle Kevan had two other sons; this one was unlikely to live out the year. Cersei would have him killed out of hand if she learned he was betraying her, and if by some grace of the gods she did not, Lancel would never survive the day Jaime Lannister returned to King's Landing. The only question would be whether Jaime cut him down in a jealous rage, or Cersei murdered him first to keep Jaime from finding out. Tyrion's silver was on Cersei.</div>

<div class="line_en">The city streets were dangerous, but with Bronn beside him Tyrion felt safe enough. The guards let him out a postern gate in the north wall, and they rode down Shadowblack Lane to the foot of Aegon's High Hill, and thence onto Pigrun Alley, past rows of shuttered windows and tall timber-and-stone buildings whose upper stories leaned out so far over the street they almost kissed. The moon seemed to follow them as they went, playing peek-and-sneak among the chimneys. They encountered no one but a lone old crone, carrying a dead cat by the tail. She gave them a fearful look, as if she were afraid they might try to steal her dinner, and slunk off into the shadows without a word.</div>

Bronn went upstairs with a dark-eyed girl from Dorne, but Alayaya was busy entertaining. "She will be so pleased to know you've come," said Chataya. "I will see that the turret room is made ready for you. Will my lord take a cup of wine while he waits?"</div>

Men like that… too honest to live, too noble to shit, Cersei devours such fools every morning when she breaks her fast. The only way to defeat my sister is to play her own game, and that was something the Lords Stark and Arryn would never do. Small wonder that both of them were dead, while Tyrion Lannister had never felt more alive. His stunted legs might make him a comic grotesque at a harvest ball, but this dance he knew.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="提利昂回想起前两任首相，他们显然对姐姐的阴谋诡计准备不足。这很自然，他们那种人…太过正直，难以生存，太过高尚，不愿欺骗，瑟曦每天都在吞噬这样的傻子。想要对付姐姐，惟一的方法就是以其人之道，还治其人之身，而这种做法史塔克公爵和艾林公爵又不屑为之。所以他们进了坟墓，而他提利昂·兰尼斯特却过得生龙活虎。他这双发育不良的短腿所跳的舞或许会让他成为丰收宴会上的笑柄，但对这种舞，他可是驾轻就熟。">查看中文翻译</div>

He had seldom seen such elegance and dignity in a whore. Though to be sure, she saw herself more as a kind of priestess. Perhaps that is the secret. It is not what we do, so much as why we do it. Somehow that thought comforted him.</div>

It was pleasant to think that men still sang, even in the midst of butchery and famine. Remembered notes filled his head, and for a moment he could almost hear Tysha as she'd sung to him half a lifetime ago. He reined up to listen. The tune was wrong, the words too faint to hear.

<div class="line_en">The gates of the manse were closed and barred. Tyrion pounded until the ornate bronze eye clacked open. "It's me." The man who admitted him was one of Varys's prettier finds, a Braavosi daggerman with a harelip and a lazy eye. Tyrion had wanted no handsome young guardsmen loitering about Shae day after day. "Find me old, ugly, scarred men, preferably impotent," he had told the eunuch. "Men who prefer boys. Or men who prefer sheep, for that matter." Varys had not managed to come up with any sheeplovers, but he did find a eunuch strangler and a pair of foulsmelling Ibbenese who were as fond of axes as they were of each other. The others were as choice a lot of mercenaries as ever graced a dungeon, each uglier than the last. When Varys had paraded them before him, Tyrion had been afraid he'd gone too far, but Shae had never uttered a word of complaint. And why would she? She has never complained of me, and I'm more hideous than all her guards together. Perhaps she does not even see ugliness.</div>
