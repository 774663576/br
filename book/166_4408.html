<div class="line_en">She chose a simple dress of dark grey wool, plainly cut but richly embroidered around the collar and sleeves. Her fingers felt thick and clumsy as she struggled with the silver fastenings without the benefit of servants. Jeyne Poole had been confined with her, but Jeyne was useless. Her face was puffy from all her crying, and she could not seem to stop sobbing about her father.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I'm certain your father is well," Sansa told her when she had finally gotten the dress buttoned right. "I'll ask the queen to let you see him." She thought that kindness might lift Jeyne's spirits, but the other girl just looked at her with red, swollen eyes and began to cry all the harder. She was such a child.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我相信你父亲一定没事，”总算扣好衣服后，珊莎告诉她，“我会请王后让你见见他。”她本以为如此好心的提议定可提起珍妮的精神，想不到她却用红肿的眼睛怔怔地看她，然后哭得更厉害。真是个长不大的小孩。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sansa had wept too, the first day. Even within the stout walls of Maegor's Holdfast, with her door closed and barred, it was hard not to be terrified when the killing began. She had grown up to the sound of steel in the yard, and scarcely a day of her life had passed without hearing the clash of sword on sword, yet somehow knowing that the fighting was real made all the difference in the world. She heard it as she had never heard it before, and there were other sounds as well, grunts of pain, angry curses, shouts for help, and the moans of wounded and dying men. In the songs, the knights never screamed nor begged for mercy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="事发当天，珊莎也哭过。纵然有梅葛楼重重厚墙所保护，且房门紧闭放下门闩，但屠杀开始时却依旧骇人。她从小听着广场上的金铁交击声长大，几乎天天都会见识刀剑，可一旦知道外面是来真的，一切又都不一样了。它们变得那么陌生，闻所未闻的声音不断传来：吃痛闷哼声、愤怒咒骂声、呼喊求救声，以及负伤垂死之人的呻吟。歌谣里的骑士从来不会惨叫，从来不会跪地求饶。">查看中文翻译</div>

</div>
<div class="line_en">The second day was even worse. The room where Sansa had been confined was at the top of the highest tower of Maegor's Holdfast. From its window, she could see that the heavy iron portcullis in the gatehouse was down, and the drawbridge drawn up over the deep dry moat that separated the keep-within-a-keep from the larger castle that surrounded it. Lannister guardsmen prowled the walls with spears and crossbows to hand. The fighting was over, and the silence of the grave had settled over the Red Keep. The only sounds were Jeyne Poole's endless whimpers and sobs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天情况更糟。珊莎被监禁的房间位于梅葛楼最高塔的顶层。从窗户望去可以看到城门楼的铁闸已经放下，干涸护城河上的吊桥升起，切断了这座城中城与城堡其余部分的联系。兰尼斯特卫兵手执长枪和十字弓逡巡于城墙之上。打斗已经结束，宛如墓地般的死寂笼罩了红堡，只剩下珍妮·普尔无尽的抽噎啜泣。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So she wept, pleading through her door for them to tell her what was happening, calling for her father, for Septa Mordane, for the king, for her gallant prince. If the men guarding her heard her pleas, they gave no answer. The only time the door opened was late that night, when they thrust Jeyne Poole inside, bruised and shaking. "They're killing everyone," the steward's daughter had shrieked at her. She went on and on. The Hound had broken down her door with a warhammer, she said. There were bodies on the stair of the Tower of the Hand, and the steps were slick with blood. Sansa dried her own tears as she struggled to comfort her friend. They went to sleep in the same bed, cradled in each other's arms like sisters.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所以她哭了，隔着门请求他们告诉她到底发生了什么。她呼唤父亲，呼唤茉丹修女，呼唤国王，呼唤她的白马王子。可惜就算门外守卫听见了她的哀求，他们也没有回应。他们只在当天深夜打开门，把浑身淤伤、颤抖不已的珍妮·普尔推进来。“他们把所有人都杀光了。”管家的女儿朝她尖叫。说猎狗拿着战锤破门进入她的房间，首相塔的螺旋梯上全是死尸，染血的阶梯滑溜溜的。珊莎擦干眼泪，努力安慰自己的朋友。她们睡在同一张床上，相互搂抱，宛如姐妹。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At sunset on the second day, a great bell began to ring. Its voice was deep and sonorous, and the long slow clanging filled Sansa with a sense of dread. The ringing went on and on, and after a while they heard other bells answering from the Great Sept of Baelor on Visenya's Hill. The sound rumbled across the city like thunder, warning of the storm to come.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="震耳欲聋的钟声于那天日落时分响起。钟声沉厚而洪亮，缓慢悠长的余音却教珊莎感到莫名的恐惧。钟声响而未绝，一会儿之后她们听见维桑尼亚丘陵上贝勒大圣堂里的钟也跟着回应。声音宛如阵雷，轰隆响彻全城，预示着即将来临的狂风暴雨。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They were fed -- hard cheese and fresh-baked bread and milk to break their fast, roast chicken and greens at midday, and a late supper of beef and barley stew -- but the servants who brought the meals would not answer Sansa's questions. That evening, some women brought her clothes from the Tower of the Hand, and some of Jeyne's things as well, but they seemed nearly as frightened as Jeyne, and when she tried to talk to them, they fled from her as if she had the grey plague. The guards outside the door still refused to let them leave the room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她们没被饿着——早餐是硬乳酪，刚出炉的面包和牛奶，中午是烤鸡和青蔬，晚餐则是牛肉大麦浓汤——但送饭的人拒绝回答珊莎的问题。当天傍晚，有几位妇人从首相塔带了些她和珍妮的衣物过来，可她们惊慌失措的程度与珍妮不相上下，她刚要开口问话，她们便仿如见了灰疫病般避之唯恐不及。门外的守卫也依旧不让她们离开房间。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Please, I need to speak to the queen again," Sansa told them, as she told everyone she saw that day. "She'll want to talk to me, I know she will.

<div class="line_en">"The king is dead." Sansa could not say how she knew it, yet she did. The slow, endless clanging filled their room, as mournful as a dirge. Had some enemy stormed the castle and murdered King Robert? Was that the meaning of the fighting they had heard?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“国王驾崩了。”珊莎说不上自己如何知道，但她就是知道。缓慢而无止尽的钟声充斥房间，哀伤有如挽歌。难道有敌人攻进城里，杀害了劳勃国王？难道这就是她们所听见的打斗？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“发生了什么事？”珍妮捂着耳朵问，“他们为什么敲钟？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ser Boros was an ugly man with a broad chest and short, bandy legs. His nose was flat, his cheeks baggy with jowls, his hair grey and brittle. Today he wore white velvet, and his snowy cloak was fastened with a lion brooch. The beast had the soft sheen of gold, and his eyes were tiny rubies. "You look very handsome and splendid this morning, Ser Boros," Sansa told him. A lady remembered her courtesies, and she was resolved to be a lady no matter what.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="柏洛斯爵士是个胸膛宽厚，有一双向外弯曲的短腿的丑陋男子。他生了个扁鼻，两颊松弛，一头发质糟糕的灰发。这天他穿了白天鹅绒外衣，雪白披风用一个狮子别针系着。狮子镀上一层软金箔，有小小的红宝石镶成的眼睛。“柏洛斯爵士，您今早真是容光焕发，格外迷人哪。”珊莎告诉他。官家小姐无时无刻不能忘记礼貌，而且她下定决心无论如何都要有个官家小姐的样子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sansa had expected that Ser Boros would escort her to the royal apartments, but instead he led her out of Maegor's Holdfast. The bridge was down again. Some workmen were lowering a man on ropes into the depths of the dry moat. When Sansa peered down, she saw a body impaled on the huge iron spikes below. She averted her eyes quickly, afraid to ask, afraid to look too long, afraid he might be someone she knew.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="珊莎本以为柏洛斯爵士会护送她到王家居室，没想到他却领她走出了梅葛楼。吊桥已再度放下。几名工人正把同伴用绳子垂到干涸的护城河床。珊莎探头一看，只见下方巨大的尖刺上钉了一具尸首。她连忙移开视线，不敢发问，不敢再看，不敢想象那是某位她所认识的人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They found Queen Cersei in the council chambers, seated at the head of a long table littered with papers, candles, and blocks of sealing wax. The room was as splendid as any that Sansa had ever seen. She stared in awe at the carved wooden screen and the twin sphinxes that sat beside the door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们在议事厅里找到瑟曦王后，她正坐在长桌的首位，桌上堆满纸张、蜡烛和一叠叠的蜡泥。珊莎不曾见过陈设如此华丽的房间，不由得睁大眼睛看着雕花木屏风，以及蹲坐大门两侧的人面狮身兽雕像。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There were guards outside her door, Lannister men-at-arms in crimson cloaks and lion-crested helms. Sansa made herself smile at them pleasantly and bid them a good morning as she passed. It was the first time she had been allowed outside the chamber since Ser Arys Oakheart had led her there two mornings past. "To keep you safe, my sweet one," Queen Cersei had told her. "Joffrey would never forgive me if anything happened to his precious."</div>

<div class="line_en">Sansa had hoped Joffrey might be with her. Her prince was not there, but three of the king's councillors were. Lord Petyr Baelish sat on the queen's left hand, Grand Maester Pycelle at the end of the table, while Lord Varys hovered over them, smelling flowery. All of them were clad in black, she realized with a feeling of dread. Mourning clothes…</div>

<div class="line_en">The queen wore a high-collared black silk gown, with a hundred dark red rubies sewn into her bodice, covering her from neck to bosom. They were cut in the shape of teardrops, as if the queen were weeping blood. Cersei smiled to see her, and Sansa thought it was the sweetest and saddest smile she had ever seen. "Sansa, my sweet child," she said, "I know you've been asking for me. I'm sorry that I could not send for you sooner. Matters have been very unsettled, and I have not had a moment. I trust my people have been taking good care of you?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"Robert thought so," said the queen. "This betrayal would have broken his heart. The gods are kind, that he did not live to see it." She sighed. "Sansa, sweetling, you must see what a dreadful position this has left us in. You are innocent of any wrong, we all know that, and yet you are the daughter of a traitor. How can I allow you to marry my son?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“劳勃当初也是这么想，”王后道，“他若是地下有知，这件事准会伤透他的心。幸好诸神慈悲，没让他生前见到。”她叹口气。“珊莎，我亲爱的好孩子，你一定也知道这件事让我们有多为难。此事与你无关，这我们都明白，但你毕竟是个叛国者的女儿，你说我怎么敢让你嫁给我儿子呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No," Sansa blurted. "He wouldn't do that. He wouldn't!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，”珊莎脱口而出，“他绝不会做这种事，他绝不会！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Please, Your Grace, there's been a mistake." Sudden panic made her dizzy and faint. "Please, send for my father, he'll tell you, he would never write such a letter, the king was his friend."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“求求您，王后陛下，这一定是误会，”突如其来的恐慌使她感到头晕目眩。“求求您，找我父亲过来，他会向您解释，他是国王的朋友，绝不会写这种信。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The queen picked up a letter. The paper was torn and stiff with dried blood, but the broken seal was her father's, the direwolf stamped in pale wax. "We found this on the captain of your household guard, Sansa. It is a letter to my late husband's brother Stannis, inviting him to take the crown."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="王后拣起一封信。信纸撕得稀烂，沾满干涸的血渍，然而上面被揭开的封蜡毫无疑问是父亲的冰原狼家徽。“珊莎，这是我们在你家侍卫队长身上找到的。收信人是我亡夫的弟弟史坦尼斯，信上邀请他来夺取王位。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But I love him," Sansa wailed, confused and frightened. What did they mean to do to her? What had they done to her father? It was not supposed to happen this way. She had to wed Joffrey, they were betrothed, he was promised to her, she had even dreamed about it. It wasn't fair to take him away from her on account of whatever her father might have done.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可是我爱他啊。”珊莎既困惑又害怕地啜泣道。他们打算如何处置她？他们又对父亲做了些什么？事情不应该变成这样子的。她一定要嫁给乔佛里，他们不是已经订婚了吗？他不是已经许给她了吗？她还梦见过两人成亲的景象呢。因为父亲的所作所为，便要硬生生将他夺走，实在太不公平了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It was for love," Sansa said in a rush. "Father wouldn't even give me leave to say farewell." She was the good girl, the obedient girl, but she had felt as wicked as Arya that morning, sneaking away from Septa Mordane, defying her lord father. She had never done anything so willful before, and she would never have done it then if she hadn't loved Joffrey as much as she did. "He was going to take me back to Winterfell and marry me to some hedge knight, even though it was Joff I wanted. I told him, but he wouldn't listen." The king had been her last hope. The king could command Father to let her stay in King's Landing and marry Prince Joffrey, Sansa knew he could, but the king had always frightened her. He was loud and rough-voiced and drunk as often as not, and he would probably have just sent her back to Lord Eddard, if they even let her see him. So she went to the queen instead, and poured out her heart, and Cersei had listened and thanked her sweetly… only then Ser Arys had escorted her to the high room in Maegor's Holdfast and posted guards, and a few hours later, the fighting had begun outside. "Please," she finished, "you have to let me marry Joffrey, I'll be ever so good a wife to him, you'll see. I'll be a queen just like you, I promise."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是啊，我好爱他，”珊莎急促地说，“可父亲连让我说声再见都不准。”她向来是听话乖巧的好女儿，但那天早上她偷偷从茉丹修女身边溜开，违背父亲意愿的时候，却觉得自己跟艾莉亚一样坏。她以前从未如此任性而为，若非她深爱着乔佛里，也不会这么做。“他打算送我回临冬城，把我嫁给默默无闻的雇佣骑士，也不管我只想要。我跟他说了，可他就是听不进去。”她的希望只剩下国王，只有国王才能命令父亲让她留在君临，和乔佛里成亲。话虽如此，她却一直很怕这个讲话粗声粗气，成天喝得酩酊大醉的国王，更何况就算当真见到他，他很可能只会派人把她送回父亲身边。所以她去找王后，将心事和盘吐露，瑟曦听完之后，郑重地向她道谢…接着却派亚历斯爵士护送她到梅葛楼的高塔房间，并在门外安排守卫，没过多久，外面便传来打斗声。“求求您，”她把话说完，“您一定要让我嫁给乔佛里，我会当个好妻子的，真的，我保证会当个像您一样的王后。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"How well I know that, child," Cersei said, her voice so kind and sweet. "Why else should you have come to me and told me of your father's plan to send you away from us, if not for love?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“孩子，这我难道不清楚吗？”瑟曦慈祥、和蔼又温柔地说，“你若不是爱他，又怎么会来见我，把你父亲送你走的计划倾诉给我听呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>

"Child," she said, "if I could truly believe that you were not like your father, why nothing should please me more than to see you wed to my Joffrey. I know he loves you with all his heart."

If she went to him and pleaded for mercy, she was certain he'd listen. He had to listen, he loved her, even the queen said so. Joff would need to punish Father, the lords would expect it, but perhaps he could send him back to Winterfell, or exile him to one of the Free Cities across the narrow sea. It would only have to be for a few years. By then she and Joffrey would be married. Once she was queen, she could persuade Joff to bring Father back and grant him a pardon.</div>
