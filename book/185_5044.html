<div class="line_en">Suddenly he heard a horn -- not a great throbbing horn like the horns of Tashbaan but a merry call, Ti-ro-to-to-ho! Next moment he came out into a wide glade and found himself in a crowd of people.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然，他听到了号角的声音——不是像塔什班城那种震撼人心的响亮的号角，而是一种欢乐的呼唤，蒂——罗——托托——霍！不久他就走进一片宽阔的林间空地，发觉自己置身一大群人中间了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When Shasta went through the gate he found a slope of grass and a little heather running up before him to some trees. He had nothing to think about now and no plans to make: he had only to run, and that was quite enough. His limbs were shaking, a terrible stitch was beginning in his side, and the sweat that kept dropping into his eyes blinded them and made them smart. He was unsteady on his feet too, and more than once he nearly turned his ankle on a loose stone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="沙斯塔穿过门，但见面前一个青草妻萎的山坡，还有些石南往上蔓延到一些树木附近。如今他没有什么事情要考虑的，没有什么计划要制定的，他只要飞跑就是了；飞跑也够他受的。他的四肢战战兢兢，两肋开始剧痛，汗珠不断地滚进眼睛里，弄得两眼疼痛而又模糊不清。他的脚步也不稳了，不止一次，他的脚踝骨撞在零乱的石头上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The trees were thicker now than they had yet been and in the more open spaces there was bracken. The sun had gone in without making it any cooler. It had become one of those hot, grey days when there seem to be twice as many flies as usual. Shasta's face was covered with them; he didn't even try to shake them off -- he had too much else to do.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在树木比刚才浓密了，更多的空地里长着欧洲膜。太阳已经落山，可并没使这个地方凉快些，却使它变得炎热而暗淡，苍蝇也比平常多了一倍。沙斯塔的脸上爬满了苍蝇，他甚至并不设法驱逐它们——他要干的其他事情实在太多了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At least, it looked a crowd to him. In reality there were about fifteen or twenty of them, all gentlemen in green huntingdress, with their horses; some in the saddle and some standing by their horses' heads. In the centre someone was holding the stirrup for a man to mount. And the man he was holding it for was the jolliest, fat, applecheeked, twinkling eyed King you could imagine.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="至少在他看来是一大群人。事实上，他们有十五个或二十个人光景，都是穿着绿色猎装的绅士，带着马儿，有的坐在马鞍子上，有的站在马儿脑袋边。在这群人的中央，有人拉着马镫以便另一个人跨上马去。那位人家侍候他上马的人，你可以想像得出，就是最最兴高采烈的、肥胖的、生着苹果脸和闪烁眼睛的国王。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For answer Shasta put his foot in the stirrup of the horse which had been led towards him and a moment later he was in the saddle. He had done it a hundred times with Bree in the last few weeks, and his mounting was very different now from what it had been on that first night when Bree had said that he climbed up a horse as if he were climbing a haystack.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="马牵过来了。作为回答，沙斯塔把脚踏在马镫上，很快就坐到马鞍上了。在最近几个星期里，他由布里引导着，已经跨上马背一百多次了，他第一夜爬上马背时布里说他简直像爬上一个干草堆，现在的情况可大不相同了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was pleased to hear the Lord Darrin say to the King, "The boy has a true horseman's seat, Sire. I'll warrant there's noble blood in him."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他很高兴地听到达兰爵士对国王说道“这孩子骑马的姿势有真正的骑士风度，陛下。我保证他身上有贵族血统。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"His blood, aye, there's the point," said the King. And he stared hard at Shasta again with that curious expression, almost a hungry expression, in his steady, grey eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他的血统，是呀，这就是关键。”国王说。他重新曰不转睛地瞧着沙斯塔，沉着的灰色眼睛里露出一种探询的神色，一种几乎如饥似渴的神色。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But by now -the whole party was moving off at a brisk canter. Shasta's seat was excellent but he was sadly puzzled what to do with his reins, for he had never touched the reins while he was on Bree's back. But he looked very carefully out of the corners of his eyes to see what the others were doing (as some of us have done at parties when we weren't quite sure which knife or fork we were meant to use) and tried to get his fingers right. But he didn't dare to try really directing the horse; he trusted it would follow the rest. The horse was of course an ordinary horse, not a Talking Horse; but it had quite wits enough to realize that the strange boy on its back had no whip and no spurs and was not really master of the situation. That was why Shasta soon found himself at the tail end of the procession.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但现在这一群绅士以轻快的慢跑统统行动起来了。沙斯塔坐的马鞍子极好，但他苦恼地不知道怎样运用缰绳，因为他骑在布里背上时是从来不去碰那缰绳的。但他小心翼翼地从眼角里瞧着别人的动作（就像我们有些人在宴会上对于该用刀或叉没多大把握时那样），竭力使自己的手指姿势正确。但他不敢真的利用缰绳去指挥马儿，他深信马儿会跟着其余的人马行动。这马儿当然是一匹普普通通的马儿，不是一匹会说人话的马儿；但它的智慧也足以认识到：这个骑在它背上的陌生孩子，既没有鞭子，又没有马刺，并非真正控制局面的主人。这就是为什么沙斯塔不久便发现自己落在整个队伍末尾的缘故。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Even so, he was going pretty fast. There were no flies now and the air in his face was delicious. He had got his breath back too. And his errand had succeeded. For the first time since the arrival at Tashbaan (how long ago it seemed!) he was beginning to enjoy himself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="即使如此，他跑得还挺快。现在没有苍蝇了，拂面的空气是清新的。他也恢复正常的呼吸了，而且他报信的使命已经完成。自从到达塔什班城以来（仿佛已经是很久很久以前的事情了！），他第一次感到自得其乐。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He looked up to see how much nearer the mountain tops had come. To his disappointment he could not see them at all: only a vague greyness, rolling down towards them. He had never been in mountain country before and was surprised. "It's a cloud," he said to himself, "a cloud coming down. I see. Up here in the hills one is really in the sky. I shall see what the inside of a cloud is like. What fun! I've often wondered." Far away on his left and a little behind him, the sun was getting ready to set.</div>

<div class="line_en">They had come to a rough kind of road by now and were making very good speed. But Shasta's horse was still the last of the lot. Once or twice when the road made a bend (there was now continuous forest on each side of it) he lost sight of the others for a second or two.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在他们来到崎岖的道路上，正在加快驰骋的速度。但沙斯塔的马儿仍旧落在最后。有一两次，逢到大路转弯时（现在大路两旁都是绵延不断的森林了），有那么一两秒钟，他望不见前边的人马。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Someone at the head of the column winded the horn every now and then, and each time the sound came from a little farther off. He couldn't see any of the others now, but of course he'd be able to as soon as he got round the next bend. But when he rounded it he still couldn't see them. In fact he could see nothing at all. His horse was walking now. "Get on, Horse, get on," said Shasta. Then came the horn, very faint. Bree had always told him that he must keep his heels well turned out, and Shasta had got the idea that something very terrible would happen if he dug his heels into a horse's sides. This seemed to him an occasion for trying it. "Look here, Horse," he said, "if you don't buck up, do you know what I'll do? I'll dig my heels into you. I really will." The horse, however, took no notice of this threat. So Shasta settled himself firmly in the saddle, gripped with his knees, clenched his teeth, and punched both the horse's sides with his heels as hard as he could.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="纵队的前头有人不时吹响号角，每次号角声传来时，都比上一次远了一点儿。现在他没法儿看到别的人马，但只要他再转过弯去，他就立刻可以看到他们。但当他转过弯来时，却仍旧看不见他们。事实上，他压根儿什么也看不见。现在他的马儿是在散步了。“赶上去，马儿，赶上去。”沙斯塔说。然后传来了号角声，可是十分轻微。布里总是嘱咐他，必须使脚跟朝着外边儿，沙斯塔由此养成一种概念如果他让脚跟戳到马儿的两胁上，就会发生可怕的事情。他觉得此刻倒可以试试。“听着，马儿，”他说，“如果你再不快跑，你可知道我要干什么？我要用脚跟戳到你的两胁里。我真的干得出来的。”然而，这马儿不理睬他的威胁。所以，沙斯塔便稳稳地坐牢在马鞍子上，牙齿咬紧，双膝夹紧，尽力用两个脚跟狠狠刺马儿的两胁。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then they plunged into the fog, or else the fog rolled over them. The world became grey. Shasta had not realized how cold and wet the inside of a cloud would be; nor how dark. The grey turned to black with alarming speed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着他们进入了大雾，或者说大雾滚滚，把他们吞没了。世界变成灰蒙蒙的。沙斯塔不曾认识到处在云雾之中竟会这么寒冷、这么潮湿，也不知道竟会那么黑暗。灰色以惊人的速度变成黑色了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Presently he came to a place where the road divided into two. He was just wondering which led to Anvard when he was startled by a noise from behind him. It was the noise of trotting horses. "Rabadash!" thought Shasta. He had no way of guessing which road Rabadash would take. "But if I take one," said Shasta to himself, "he may take the other: and if I stay at the cross-roads I'm sure to be caught." He dismounted and led his horse as quickly as he could along the right-hand road.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不久他来到了一个岔路口。他正在琢磨哪一条路是通向安瓦德的，这时他背后一阵声音使他吃了惊。原来是马儿奔腾的声音。“拉巴达什！”少斯塔心中想道。他没法儿猜测拉巴达什会走哪条路。“但如果我走这一条，”沙斯塔跟自己说道，“他说不定会走那一条，如果我待在这岔路口，我一定会被他们逮住的。”他下了马，尽最大力量赶紧牵着马儿沿右边那条路走去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The only result was that the horse broke into a kind of pretence of a trot for five or six paces and then subsided into a walk again.

<div class="line_en">"Attend, all of you," it said. "We are now within a furlong of the castle. Remember your orders. Once we are in Narnia, as we should be by sunrise, you are to kill as little as possible. On this venture you are to regard every drop of Narnian blood as more precious than a gallon of your own. On this venture, I say. The gods will send us a happier hour and then you must leave nothing alive between Cair Paravel and the Western Waste. But we are not yet in Narnia. Here in Archenland it is another thing. In the assault on this castle of King Lune's, nothing matters but speed. Show your mettle. It must be mine within an hour. And if it is, I give it all to you. I reserve no booty for myself. Kill me every barbarian male within its walls, down to the child that was born yesterday, and everything else is yours to divide as you please -- the women, the gold, the jewels, the weapons, and the wine. The man that I see hanging back when we come to the gates shall be burned alive. In the name of Tash the irresistible, the inexorable forward!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你们大家注意啦，”这声音说道，“我们现在离城堡不到八分之一英里了。牢牢记住命令。一旦我们进入纳尼亚国境（应该在太阳出来时到达），你们要尽可能少杀人。在此番冒险行动中，你们要把每一滴纳尼亚人的血看得比你们自己的每一加仑血还要重要。我说的是在此番冒险行动中。天神会赐给我好时辰的，那时你们在凯尔帕拉维尔和西部沙漠之间就不必留下任何活的东西了。但你们现在还没有进入纳尼亚境内。在这儿阿钦兰境内那就是另外一回事了。在攻击伦恩国王的城堡时，最要紧的是速度，其他都无足轻重。拿出你们的勇气来。必须在一个钟头之内把它拿下来。如果你们占领了它，我把一切都给你们。我什么战利品也不留给自己。替我把城墙里每一个野蛮的男子，直到昨天刚生的孩子，统统杀掉，其余的一切也归你们，你们高兴怎样分享就怎样分享——包括女人、金子、珠宝、武器和美酒。进到城门口而退缩的人，我要把他活活烧死。以不可抗拒、不可阻挡的塔什神的名义——前进！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="沙斯塔认为骑兵纵队花了好长时间才开过去，尽管他整天讲着、想着“二百人马”，他可并未确悉他们究竟有多少人马。最后，骑兵纵队的声音终于消失了，他再次独自听着树木枝头滴水的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But that all depends on what you mean by somewhere. The road kept on getting to somewhere in the sense that it got to more and more trees, all dark and dripping, and to colder and colder air. And strange, icy winds kept blowing the mist past him though they never blew it away. If he had been used to mountain country he would have realized that this meant he was now very high up -- perhaps right at the top of the pass. But Shasta knew nothing about mountains.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但那完全在于你所说的某个地方是什么意思。道路不断地向某个地方延伸，一路上树木愈来愈多，而且全都是黑沉沉的，滴滴答答地滴着水珠，空气愈来愈凛冽，奇怪而冰冷的风不断地把事睛从他身旁吹过，却从不把雾霭吹散掉。如果他习惯于山野风光的话，他就会明白，这意味着他现在攀登得很高了——也许正好在那关隘的顶上。但沙斯塔对山岭一无所知。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He now knew the way to Anvard but of course he could not now go there: that would only mean running into the arms of Rabadash's troopers. "What on earth am I to do?" said Shasta to himself. But he remounted his horse and continued along the road he had chosen, in the faint hope of finding some cottage where he might ask for shelter and a meal. He had thought, of course, of going back to Aravis and Bree and Hwin at the hermitage, but he couldn't because by now he had not the least idea of the direction.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在他知道到安瓦德去的路了，但他此刻当然不能到那儿去，去的话只不过是意味着撞到拉巴达什军队的刀剑上去。“我究竟该干什么呢？”沙斯塔跟他自己说。他重新跨上了马，沿着他选定的道路继续前进，心里抱着微薄的希望，但愿能找到一间茅屋，在那儿求个栖身之所，弄到一顿饭吃。当然，他曾想回到隐士住处同阿拉维斯、布里、赫温相会，可是他办不到，因为如今他压根儿弄不清方向了。">查看中文翻译</div>

Those Narnian lords and ladies got safe away from Tashbaan; I was left behind. Aravis and Bree and Hwin are all as snug as anything with that old Hermit: of course I was the one who was sent on.

<div class="line_cn" title="“我确实认为，”沙斯塔说，“我必定是活在世界上的最最不幸的孩子了。除了我，人人都是万事如意。那些纳尼亚王公和小姐都安全离开了塔什班城，我却被留在后面。阿拉维斯、布里、赫温跟老隐士在一起，要多舒适就有多舒适：当然只派我出来奔波。伦恩国王和他的随从必定已经安全进入城堡，早在拉巴达什到达之前把城门关上了，唯独我被丢在外边了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">What put a stop to all this was a sudden fright. Shasta discovered that someone or somebody was walking beside him. It was pitch dark and he could see nothing. And the Thing (or Person) was going so quietly that he could hardly hear any footfalls. What he could hear was breathing. His invisible companion seemed to breathe on a very large scale, and Shasta got the impression that it was a very large creature. And he had come to notice this breathing so gradually that he had really no idea how long it had been there. It was a horrible shock.</div>
