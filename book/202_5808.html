<div class="line_en">Autumn seemed to arrive suddenly that year. The morning of the first of September was CRIsp and golden as an apple, and as the little family bobbed across the rumbling road toward the great sooty station, the fumes of car exhausts and the breath of pedestrians sparkled like cobwebs in the cold air. Two large cages rattled on top of the laden trolleys the parents were pushing; the owls inside them hooted indignantly, and the redheaded girl trailed tearfully behind her brothers, clutching her father's arm.</div>

<div class="line_en">But James caught his mother's eye and fell silent. The five Potters approached the barrier. With a slightly cocky look over his shoulder at his younger brother, James took the trolley from his mother and broke into a run. A moment later, he had vanished.</div>

<div class="line_en">Side by side, they pushed the second trolley forward, gathering speed. As they reached the barrier, Albus winced, but no collision came. Instead, the family emerged onto platform nine and threequarters, which was obscured by thick white steam that was pouring from the scarlet Hogwarts Express. Indistinct figures were swarming through the mist, into which James had already disappeared.</div>

<div class="line_en">But the vapor was dense, and it was difficult to make out anybody's faces. Detached from their owners, voices sounded unnaturally loud. Harry thought he heard Percy discoursing loudly on broomstick regulations, and was quite glad of the excuse not to stop and say hello…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但蒸气太浓了，很难看清人们的面孔。看不见人的说话声听起来异常响亮。哈利好像听到珀西在高声谈论飞天扫帚管理问题，他庆幸可以不用停下来打招呼了……">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“他不是当真的，”赫敏对金妮说，但罗恩的注意力已经转移了。看到哈利的目光，他把头向五十米外微微一点。此刻蒸气消散了一些，三个轮廓分明的人影站在飘浮的雾气中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Draco Malfoy was standing there with his wife and son, a dark coat buttoned up to his throat. His hair was receding somewhat, which emphasized the pointed chin. The new boy resembled Draco as much as Albus resembled Harry. Draco caught sight of Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny staring at him, nodded curtly, and turned away again.</div>
