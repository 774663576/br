<div class="line_en">Vittoria reached the bottom of the spiral staircase and entered the grotto. The darkened tunnel reminded her of CERN's Large Hadron Collider -- black and cold. Lit now only by the flashlights of the Swiss Guards, the tunnel carried a distinctly incorporeal feel. On both sides, hollow niches lined the walls. Recessed in the alcoves, as far as the lights let them see, the hulking shadows of sarcophagi loomed.</div>

<div class="line_en">An iciness raked her flesh. It's the cold, she told herself, knowing that was only partially true. She had the sense they were being watched, not by anyone in the flesh, but by specters in the dark. On top of each tomb, in full papal vestments, lay life-sized semblances of each Pope, shown in death, arms folded across their chests. The prostrate bodies seemed to emerge from within the tombs, pressing upward against the marble lids as if trying to escape their mortal restraints. The flashlight procession moved on, and the papal silhouettes rose and fell against the walls, stretching and vanishing in a macabre shadowbox dance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她身上掠过一股寒意。因为太冷了，她告诉自己，但心知不止如此。她觉得被监视了，盯著他们的不是任何有肉身形体的活物，而是黑暗中的幽灵。每个墓棺上，都躺著跟每个教宗真人一样大小的仿製雕像，穿著全套祭衣，死亡的模样，双臂在胸前交叉。那些仰卧的形体似乎从坟墓中冒出，想要推开大理石棺盖，逃避凡人必有一死的大限。手电筒的光束继续前行，那些教宗的剪影在墙上升起又落下，在阴森的骷髅影舞裡浮现又消失。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I worked under the cardinal's tutelage for many years, the camerlegno had said. He was like a father to me. Vittoria recalled the camerlegno speaking those words in reference to the cardinal who had "saved" him from the army. Now, however, Vittoria understood the rest of the story. That very cardinal who had taken the camerlegno under his wing had apparently later risen to the papacy and brought with him his young protégé to serve as chamberlain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我在那位枢机主教的保护下工作了许多年。我觉得他就像我的父亲。薇多利雅记得总司库提到那位把他从军队裡拯救出来的枢机主教时，说过这些话。但总之，薇多利雅现在知道接下来的故事了。那位将总司库纳入羽翼下的枢机主教，后来显然当选了教宗，而且让这位年轻弟子成为服事他的总管。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That explains a lot, Vittoria thought. She had always possessed a well-tuned perception for others' inner emotions, and something about the camerlegno had been nagging her all day. Since meeting him, she had sensed an anguish more soulful and private than the overwhelming crisis he now faced. Behind his pious calm, she saw a man tormented by personal demons. Now she knew her instincts had been correct. Not only was he facing the most devastating threat in Vatican history, but he was doing it without his mentor and friend… flying solo.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这解释了很多事，薇多利雅心想。她一向善于洞察其他人内心的感情，但总司库身上有个什麽困扰了她一天。打从第一次见面，她就感觉到总司库除了眼前压倒性的危机之外，还有一种更为灵魂深处、更为私人性质的苦恼。在他虔诚的冷静自持背后，她看到了一个饱受个人恶魔所折磨的凡人。现在她明白自己的直觉没错。他不单面对著梵蒂冈有史以来最具毁灭性的威胁，而且得在失去良师益友的状况下处理危机……独自单飞。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A silence had fallen across the group, and Vittoria couldn't tell whether it was one of respect or apprehension. She sensed both. The camerlegno moved with his eyes closed, as if he knew every step by heart. Vittoria suspected he had made this eerie promenade many times since the Pope's death… perhaps to pray at his tomb for guidance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一行人陷入沉默，薇多利雅无法判断是出于敬意还是忧虑，她感觉两者都有。总司库闭著眼睛往前走，好像对于每一步都了然于心。薇多利雅怀疑自从教宗死后，总司库走过这趟怪异的路程许多次……或许是为了在教宗墓前祈求指引。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Swiss Guard all bowed their heads where they were standing. Vittoria followed suit, her heart pounding in the silence. The camerlegno knelt before the tomb and prayed in Italian. As Vittoria listened to his words, an unexpected grief surfaced as tears… tears for her own mentor… her own holy father. The camerlegno's words seemed as appropriate for her father as they did for the Pope.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那些瑞士卫兵都站在原地低下头，薇多利雅也跟著照做，心脏暗自猛跳。总司库跪在墓前，用义大利文祷告。薇多利雅倾听著他的话，一股突如其来的悲痛化为泪水……为她自己痛失良师而流泪……她自己的圣父。总司库对教宗所说的话，似乎也完全适用于她父亲。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Supreme father, counselor, friend." The camerlegno's voice echoed dully around the ring. "You told me when I was young that the voice in my heart was that of God. You told me I must follow it no matter what painful places it leads. I hear that voice now, asking of me impossible tasks. Give me strength. Bestow on me forgiveness. What I do… I do in the name of everything you believe. Amen."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="「至圣圣父，良师，益友。」总司库的声音闷闷的迴盪在四周。「我年轻时，您曾告诉过我，我心中的声音就是天主的声音，无论指引我走向何等痛苦之处，我都一定要遵从。现在我听到那个声音了，要求我去做不可能的工作。请赐予我力量，赐予我宽恕。我所做的……都是奉您所相信的一切之名。阿门。」">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The guards slowed now, as if unsure where exactly in the darkness the most recent Pope was buried. The camerlegno continued assuredly and stopped before a marble tomb that seemed to glisten brighter than the others. Lying atop was a carved figure of the late Pope. When Vittoria recognized his face from television, a shot of fear gripped her. What are we doing?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在卫兵们慢下脚步了，好像在一片黑暗中，不太确定最近一位安葬的教宗的确实位置。总司库笃定地继续往前，停在一座似乎比其他墓都要亮的大理石墓前。安放在最顶端的是刚过世教宗的雕像。薇多利雅认出那张在电视上见过的脸，一股恐惧猛地攫取住了她。我们这是在干什麽啊？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I realize we do not have much time," the camerlegno said. "I still ask we take a moment of prayer."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Amen," the guards whispered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="「阿门。」那些卫兵低声道。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The camerlegno seemed to read the young man's mind. "Someday I will ask your forgiveness for placing you in this position. Today I ask for your obedience. Vatican laws are established to protect this church. It is in that very spirit that I command you to break them now."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="总司库似乎看透了那个年轻人的想法。「有朝一日我会请你宽恕我这麽为难你，但今天我要请你服从。梵蒂冈订定法律是为了要保护这个教会。就是基于这个精神，我命令你们现在把石棺打开。」">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The camerlegno stood slowly and stepped away from the tomb. "Push the covering aside."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="总司库缓缓起身，往后站开几步。「把盖子推开。」">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was a moment of silence and then the lead guard gave the order. The three men set down their flashlights on the floor, and their shadows leapt overhead. Lit now from beneath, the men advanced toward the tomb. Bracing their hands against the marble covering near the head of the tomb, they planted their feet and prepared to push. On signal, they all thrust, straining against the enormous slab. When the lid did not move at all, Vittoria found herself almost hoping it was too heavy. She was suddenly fearful of what they would find inside.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="众人沉默了一会儿，然后领头的卫兵开始下令。三个卫兵把手电筒放在地板上，把他们的影子照向天花板。靠著下方所射出的灯光，三个人走向坟墓，双手抓住靠近头部的大理石棺盖，站稳脚准备好。一声令下，他们一起往前用力推，使劲想推开那块巨大的石板，结果一动也不动，此时薇多利雅发现自己简直希望那块棺盖重得打不开。她忽然很害怕他们即将会在棺内发现的真相。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Vittoria was about to offer her own help, but just then, the lid began to slide. The men dug in again, and with an almost primal growl of stone on stone, the lid rotated off the top of the tomb and came to rest at an angle -- the Pope's carved head now pushed back into the niche and his feet extended out into the hallway.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="薇多利雅正打算要加入，但就在此时，棺盖开始滑动了。四个男人继续用力，随著一串几乎是原始的岩石摩擦隆隆声，棺盖旋出墓顶，转开一角──盖子上教宗的雕像头部现在被推进凹洞裡，双脚则对著走道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The men pushed harder, and still the stone did not move.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="三个人更用力推，那块石板依然文风不动。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Ancora,"the camerlegno said, rolling up the sleeves of his cassock and preparing to push along with them."Ora!" Everyone heaved.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="「再来一次。」总司库说，卷起他长袍的袖子，准备要帮他们忙。「推！」每个人都同时用力。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Tentatively, a guard bent and retrieved his flashlight. Then he aimed it into the tomb. The beam seemed to tremble a moment, and then the guard held it steady. The other guards gathered one by one. Even in the darkness Vittoria sensed them recoil. In succession, they crossed themselves.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一个卫兵试探性地弯腰拿起他的手电筒。然后照向石棺中。那道光束似乎颤抖了一会儿，然后那名卫兵的手稳住了。其他卫兵也陆续拾起手电筒。即使在黑暗中，薇多利雅也感觉到他们的畏缩，他们纷纷在胸前画十字。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Vittoria had feared the corpse's mouth might be clenched tight withrigor mortis and that she would have to suggest breaking the jaw to see the tongue. She now saw it would be unnecessary. The cheeks had collapsed, and the Pope's mouth gaped wide.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="薇多利雅本来担心尸体的嘴巴可能会因为尸僵而紧闭，迫使她必须建议撬开下颔才能看到舌头。但现在她看到没这个必要了。尸体的两颊凹陷，教宗的嘴巴大张著。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The camerlegno shuddered when he looked into the tomb, his shoulders dropping like weights. He stood a long moment before turning away.</div>
