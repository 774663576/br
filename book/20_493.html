<div class="line_en">"The first thing I wanted to do was share my faith," says John. "Second, I wanted to be able to hire people who needed a second, third or fourth chance; people like ex-prisoners and drug addicts. Third, I wanted to speak out on social issues. And finally, I wanted to be able to take short-term mission trips."</div>

<div class="line_en">In fact, John's original goal was to build a business to the point where he had to spend only one day per week at work and the rest of his time in Christian ministry. However, as every entrepreneur knows, rarely do the demands of even a small business afford such luxuries, especially when you're just starting out. It wasn't that John felt money was unimportant. He realized the only way to reach his other goals was to make his company profitable. Echoing in his head were the words of famed evangelist Dwight L. Moody:</div>

<div class="line_en">If you asked most entrepreneurs for five reasons why they got into business, making money would probably be close to number one. If so, that makes John Roise, owner of Lindsay Windows, something of an anomaly. When the former banker decided to enter the window business several years ago, he had four main goals in mind and none of them included the word "money".</div>

<div class="line_en">Why was John so concerned about giving rather than gaining? Back in college, John made a decision that changed his life: He had become a Christian. Having grown up in a Christian home, John thought he had all the bases covered when it came to God. He went to church, he was baptized, he was nice to his parents and he lived a decent life. But when he met his future wife Susan, she showed him that just going through the motions of faith was not enough. If he really wanted to call himself a Christian, he had to become "born again'.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="为什么约翰如此关注给予而非索取呢？早在大学时代，约翰作了一个改变他一生的决定：成为一个基督信徒。从小在基督教家庭长大的约翰，认为上帝为他安排了一切。他经常到教堂去，并接受洗礼。他对父母很好，过着一种体面的生活。但是当他遇到他未来的妻子苏珊时，她告诉他仅仅情感上感觉到的信仰是不够的。如果想成为一名真正的基督教徒，他必须要“重生”。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">John's faith grew over the next several years as he graduated from college and found work in the banking industry. An entrepreneur at heart, John also ran a few other businesses on the side, including real estate development and an oyster shell chicken feed company. While John always seemed to do well, he still hadn't found the company that would allow him to fulfill his dreams.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="之后几年，他从大学毕业并进入银行业工作，他的信念也与日俱增。他内心里是一名创业家，所以他同时还在其他几家公司做兼职，包括房地产开发和牡蛎壳制鸡饲料公司。虽然他工作出色，仍然没有找到一家公司能让自己实现梦想。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Oddly enough, John's golden opportunity came in the form of a business he knew nothing about: window manufacturing. He wasn't even interested in purchasing the company at first. Not only did he lack experience, buying the company would require him to borrow several million dollars and leave his comfortable, six-figure job in the banking industry.</div>

<div class="line_en">John decided to put the decision before God. Seeing as it was unlikely that any bank would loan him so much money, John decided to let that be the determining factor. If he managed to secure the financing, he would take it as a sign that God wanted him to take this leap of faith. If not, then he would forfeit the deal and keep looking for another business opportunity.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="约翰决定让上帝来抉择。约翰以为不会有银行肯借给他那么多钱，所以干脆先拿这个行业开刀。如果他设法融资成功，那么这就是上帝的旨意，表明要他升华这一坚定的信仰。否则的话，他甘愿放弃交易，接着在别的行业寻找机遇。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Rather than seek a loan from his own bank and risk the embarrassment of being turned down, John decided to approach another bank three hours away. He fully expected his application to be rejected, but,"Within 24 hours, I had a commitment to do the whole deal," says John.</div>
