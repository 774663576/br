<div class="line_en">The gatehouse towers emerged from the rain like ghosts, hazy grey apparitions that grew more solid the closer they rode. The Frey stronghold was not one castle but two; mirror images in wet stone standing on opposite sides of the water, linked by a great arched bridge. From the center of its span rose the Water Tower, the river running straight and swift below. Channels had been cut from the banks, to form moats that made each twin an island. The rains had turned the moats to shallow lakes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="桥头堡在暴雨中浮现，犹如两樽高大幽灵，随着人们走近，阴气逐渐凝聚成形。佛雷家共有两座石城堡，分居河的两岸，犹如镜面映射成双，中间由巨大的石拱桥相连。桥中央是卫河塔，湍急的河水从塔下流过。两岸的孪生城外围都挖了护城河，将两座城堡化为岛屿。此时，连日降水更让护城河变成了长湖。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They heard the Green Fork before they saw it, an endless susurrus, like the growl of some great beast. The river was a boiling torrent, half again as wide as it had been last year, when Robb had divided his army here and vowed to take a Frey to bride as the price of his crossing. He needed Lord Walder and his bridge then, and he needs them even more now. Catelyn's heart was full of misgivings as she watched the murky green waters swirl past. There is no way we will ford this, nor swim across, and it could be a moon's turn before these waters fall again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="抵达绿叉河之前，他们先听见了汹涌的水声，沉吟不绝，犹如巨兽咆哮。河流高涨，宽度比去年罗柏率军渡河、并答应娶佛雷家女子为妻时增加了一倍半。当时，他急需瓦德侯爵和他的桥梁，如今更为迫切。望着浑浊打旋的绿水，凯特琳心中充满疑虑。不通过孪河城，无论如何也无法返回北方，水位至少还要一个月才能下降到适当程度。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Across the turbulent waters, Catelyn could see several thousand men encamped around the eastern castle, their banners hanging like so many drowned cats from the lances outside their tents. The rain made it impossible to distinguish colors and devices. Most were grey, it seemed to her, though beneath such skies the whole world seemed grey.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="透过漫天雨水，凯特琳发现河对岸的东城下有数千士兵安营扎寨，营帐外挂的旗帜被水浸透后搭在杆子上，好似许多溺水的猫，看不清颜色与图案。她只知道大多数旗帜都是灰色的，实际上，这些日子以来，整个世界仿佛都成了灰色。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Four Freys rode out from the western gatehouse, wrapped in heavy cloaks of thick grey wool. Catelyn recognized Ser Ryman, son of the late Ser Stevron, Lord Walder's firstborn. With his father dead, Ryman was heir to the Twins. The face she saw beneath his hood was fleshy, broad, and stupid. The other three were likely his own sons, Lord Walder's great grandsons.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="东城下骑出四位佛雷，个个裹着厚重的灰羊毛斗篷。凯特琳认出已故的史提夫伦爵士——瓦德大人的长子——的长子莱曼爵士。如今，他是孪河城继承人，斗篷下的那张脸却显得肥胖、圆滚和愚蠢。其余三个估计都是他的儿子，瓦德大人的曾孙们。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Edmure confirmed as much. "Edwyn is eldest, the pale slender man with the constipated look. The wiry one with the beard is Black Walder, a nasty bit of business. Petyr is on the bay, the lad with the unfortunate face. Petyr Pimple, his brothers call him. Only a year or two older than Robb, but Lord Walder married him off at ten to a woman thrice his age. Gods, I hope Roslin doesn't take after him."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="艾德慕证实了她的猜测，“长子叫艾德温，就一脸病相、苗条苍白的那个；瘦长结实、满脸胡须的是黑瓦德，这家伙十分凶暴；骑牡马的是培提尔，这小子很不幸地生了张麻子脸，所以被家人唤做‘疙瘩脸培提尔’。他只比罗柏大出一两岁，但瓦德在他十岁那年为他娶了一个三十岁的女人。天杀的！萝丝琳千万不要长得和他一样！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Robb looked more amused than afraid. "I have an army to protect me, Mother, I don't need to trust in bread and salt. But if it pleases Lord Walder to serve me stewed crow smothered in maggots, I'll eat it and ask for a second bowl."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="罗柏似乎颇觉有趣，“我有一整支大军的保护，母亲，无需寄望于面包和食盐。但假如能与瓦德大人和解，即便他给我蛆虫炖乌鸦，我也会欣然接受，并叫他再来一碗。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They halted to let their hosts come to them. Robb's banner drooped on its staff, and the steady sound of rainfall mingled with the rush of the swollen Green Fork on their right. Grey Wind edged forward, tail stiff, watching through slitted eyes of dark gold. When the Freys were a halfdozen yards away Catelyn heard him growl, a deep rumble that seemed almost one with rush of the river. Robb looked startled. "Grey Wind, to me. To me!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="国王一行人暂时驻足，等待大队人马跟上。罗柏的旗帜软软地垂搭而下，在他们的右手方，绵延的冰雨拍打着滔滔的绿叉河水。灰风窜上前来，竖起尾巴，用暗金色的狭长眼眸瞪视着逼近的佛雷家人。当他们走到六七码的近处时，只听冰原狼一声怒吼，深沉雄浑，仿佛与河流之声合为一体。罗柏大吃一惊，“灰风，到我这儿来。灰风！”">查看中文翻译</div>

"No!" Robb was shouting. "Grey Wind, here. Here." Catelyn spurred between the direwolf and the horses. Mud spattered from the hooves of her mare as she cut in front of Grey Wind. The wolf veered away, and only then seemed to hear Robb calling.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莱曼爵士的坐骑发出一声恐惧的嘶叫，惊退开来，疙瘩脸培提尔的马则将他摔了下去。只有黑瓦德牢牢握缰，一边摸向佩剑。“不！”罗柏大叫，“灰风，过来，过来！”凯特琳忙拍马上前，挡在冰原狼和对方之间，泥泞飞溅，沾在马蹄和狼身上。灰风往外避了避，似乎这才头一次听见罗柏的召唤。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"When you are one-and-ninety, Brother, see how eager you are to go riding in the rain." Yet she wondered if that was the whole truth of it.

<div class="line_en">There was more trouble at the gatehouse. Grey Wind balked in the middle of the drawbridge, shook the rain off, and howled at the portcullis. Robb whistled impatiently. "Grey Wind. What is it? Grey Wind, with me." But the direwolf only bared his teeth. He does not like this place, Catelyn thought. Robb had to squat and speak softly to the wolf before he would consent to pass beneath the portcullis. By then Lame Lothar and Walder Rivers had come up. "It's the sound of the water he fears," Rivers said. "Beasts know to avoid the river in flood."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到达桥头堡时，麻烦再次出现。灰风走到吊桥中间，甩了甩头，不肯前进，只顾朝铁闸门咆哮。“灰风，怎么了？灰风，跟我来啊。”不管罗柏怎么劝阻，冰原狼都呲牙露齿，毫不理会。他不喜欢这地方，凯特琳意识到。最后是罗柏费尽心机，蹲下来对狼轻言软语，他才勉强通过闸门入城。这时，跛子罗索和瓦德·河文二人已跟了上来。“他受不了河的声音，”河文评论，“野兽总是害怕涨水。”">查看中文翻译</div>

His chair was black oak, its back carved into the semblance of two stout towers joined by an arched bridge, so massive that its embrace turned the old man into a grotesque child. There was something of the vulture about Lord Walder, and rather more of the weasel. His bald head, spotted with age, thrust out from his scrawny shoulders on a long pink neck. Loose skin dangled beneath his receding chin, his eyes were runny and clouded, and his toothless mouth moved constantly, sucking at the empty air as a babe sucks at his mother's breast.</div>

<div class="line_en">The eighth Lady Frey stood beside Lord Walder's high seat. At his feet sat a somewhat younger version of himself, a stooped thin man of fifty whose costly garb of blue wool and grey satin was strangely accented by a crown and collar ornamented with tiny brass bells. The likeness between him and his lord was striking, save for their eyes; Lord Frey's small, dim, and suspicious, the other's large, amiable, and vacant. Catelyn recalled that one of Lord Walder's brood had fathered a halfwit long years ago. During past visits, the Lord of the Crossing had always taken care to hide this one away. Did he always wear a fool's crown, or is that meant as mockery of Robb? It was a question she dare not ask.</div>

"You will forgive me if I do not kneel, I know. My legs no longer work as they did, though that which hangs between'em serves well enough, heh." His mouth split in a toothless smile as he eyed Robb's crown. "Some would say it's a poor king who crowns himself with bronze, Your Grace."</div>

<div class="line_en">"No." Bolton's voice was soft, but certain. "I left six hundred men at the ford. Spearmen from the rills, the mountains, and the White Knife, a hundred Hornwood longbows, some freeriders and hedge knights, and a strong force of Stout and Cerwyn men to stiffen them. Ronnel Stout and Ser Kyle Condon have the command. Ser Kyle was the late Lord Cerwyn's right hand, as I'm sure you know, my lady. Lions swim no better than wolves. So long as the river runs high, Ser Gregor will not cross."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没有，他别想过河。”波顿语音虽轻，却充满肯定，“我在渡口安排下六百精兵。其中包括来自于溪流地、山区和白刃河的矛兵，一百名霍伍德家的长弓手，许多自由骑手和雇佣骑士，并由史陶家和赛文家的队伍压阵。正副指挥分别是凯勒·孔顿爵士和罗纳·史陶爵士。凯勒爵士乃已故赛文大人的左右手，想必您也有所耳闻，夫人。狮子游泳的本领不比奔狼强，只要水位不退，格雷果爵士纵有三头六臂也过不了河。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"A folly," Lord Bolton agreed, "but Glover was heedless after he learned that Deepwood Motte had fallen. Grief and fear will do that to a man."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这的确是件蠢事，”波顿大人表示同意，“葛洛佛得知深林堡陷落后，完全丧失理智，悲伤和忧惧将他摧垮了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Gregor Clegane was always ill news, Catelyn reflected. Would Robb need to march south again to deal with him? Or was the Mountain coming here? "is Clegane across the river, then?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="格雷果·克里冈真是我们的灾星，凯特琳不禁想。如此一来，罗柏是否该回头对付魔山？兰尼斯特军要是杀过来怎么办？“克里冈过河了没有？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Your Grace is too kind. I suffered grievous losses on the Green Fork, and Glover and Tallhart worse at Duskendale."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“陛下真是太宽厚了。我去年在绿又河畔损失惨重，前次又听任葛洛佛和陶哈冒进暮谷城，酿成大败，实在惭愧。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Duskendale." Robb made the word a curse. "Robett Glover will answer for that when I see him, I promise you."</div>

<div class="line_en">"It should be enough," said Robb. "You will have command of my rear guard, Lord Bolton. I mean to start for the Neck as soon as my uncle has been wedded and bedded. We're going home."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“足够了，”罗柏说，“我指派你负责后卫部队，波顿大人。只等我舅舅完婚，咱们就兵发颈泽。咱们回家。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Duskendale was done and cold; it was the battles still to come that worried Catelyn. "How many men have you brought my son?" she asked Roose Bolton pointedly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="暮谷城的失败影响深远，但凯特琳已无暇关注，她更担心未来的战争。“你究竟为我儿带回多少人马？”她直截了当地询问卢斯·波顿。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His queer colorless eyes studied her face a moment before he answered. "Some five hundred horse and three thousand foot, my lady. Dreadfort men, in chief, and some from Karhold. With the loyalty of the Karstarks so doubtful now, I thought it best to keep them close. I regret there are not more."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他用那对奇特的淡色眼珠打量了她一会儿，方才回话：“约莫五百骑兵，三千步兵，夫人。主要是我恐怖堡的人，以及卡霍城的部队。鉴于卡史塔克家忠诚堪虞，我认为必须将他们放在身边，以防生变。很抱歉，我没能带回更多人马。”">查看中文翻译</div>
