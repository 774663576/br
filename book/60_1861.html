<div class="line_en">Thinking about the dream the next day, he remembered something. He opened a desk drawer and took out a packet of letters Sabina had written to him. He was not long in finding the following passage: I want to make love to you in my studio. It will be like a stage surrounded by people. The audience won't be allowed up close, but they won't be able to take their eyes off us…</div>

<div class="line_en">In the middle of the night she started moaning in her sleep. Tomas woke her up, but when she saw his face she said, with hatred in her voice, Get away from me! Get away from me! Then she told him her dream: The two of them and Sabina had been in a big room together. There was a bed in the middle of the room. It was like a platform in the theater. Tomas ordered her to stand in the corner while he made love to Sabina. The sight of it caused Tereza intolerable suffering. Hoping to alleviate the pain in her heart by pains of the flesh, she jabbed needles under her fingernails. It hurt so much, she said, squeezing her hands into fists as if they actually were wounded.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="夜半时分，她在睡梦中呻吟起来。托马斯叫醒她，可她一见他的脸，就恨恨地说：“你走！你走！”而后她给他讲了她的梦：他俩和萨比娜一起呆在某个地方。一个大大的房间。正中间有一张床，就像是剧院的舞台。托马斯命令她待在一边，而他当着她的面跟萨比娜做爱。她在一旁看着，这个场面让她痛苦难忍。她想用肉体的痛苦强压住灵魂的痛苦，便用针往指甲缝里刺。“真是钻心痛！”她边说边握紧拳头，好像她的手真的受了伤。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The worst of it was that the letter was dated. It was quite recent, written long after Tereza had moved in with Tomas.</div>

<div class="line_en">But he did not throw her out. He could picture her pressed against the wall of Sabina's studio jabbing needles up under her nails. He took her fingers between his hands and stroked them, brought them to his lips and kissed them, as if they still had drops of blood on them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但他没有把她撵出门。他看到了她，就靠在萨比娜的画室的墙上，把针往指甲缝里刺。他双手捂着她的手指，抚摸着，把它们送到唇边，吻着，好像上面还留有丝丝血痕。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But from that time on, everything seemed to conspire against him. Not a day went by without her learning something about his secret life.</div>

<div class="line_en">At first he denied it all. Then, when the evidence became too blatant, he argued that his polygamous way of life did not in the least run counter to his love for her. He was inconsistent: first he disavowed his infidelities, then he tried to justify them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="起初他什么都不承认。当证据再确凿不过，他便设法说服她，说他跟多个女人风流与他对特蕾莎的爱情毫不矛盾。可他的说辞前后不一：一会儿否认自己不忠，一会儿又为自己的不忠行为辩解。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This absurd jealousy, grounded as it was in mere hypotheses, proved that he considered her fidelity an unconditional postulate of their relationship. How then could he begrudge her her jealousy of his very real mistresses?</div>

<div class="line_en">He pounced on her as if trying to save her from drowning. The bottle fell to the floor, spotting the carpet with valerian drops. She put up a good fight, and he had to keep her in a straitjacket-like hold for a quarter of an hour before he could calm her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他冲了过去，像是要把溺水的她救上岸。装缬草根剂的药瓶掉到地上，在地毯上弄了一大块污渍。她拼命挣扎着，想摆脱他，他紧紧按住她，有一刻钟之久，像是在她身上套了一件疯人衣，直到她安定下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One evening, before she discovered his correspondence with Sabina, they had gone to a bar with some friends to celebrate Tereza's new job. She had been promoted at the weekly from darkroom technician to staff photographer. Because he had never been much for dancing, one of his younger colleagues took over. They made a splendid couple on the dance floor, and Tomas found her more beautiful than ever. He looked on in amazement at the split-second precision and deference with which Tereza anticipated her partner's will. The dance seemed to him a declaration that her devotion, her ardent desire to satisfy his every whim, was not necessarily bound to his person, that if she hadn't met Tomas, she would have been ready to respond to the call of any other man she might have met instead. He had no difficulty imagining Tereza and his young colleague as lovers. And the ease with which he arrived at this fiction wounded him. He realized that Tereza's body was perfectly thinkable coupled with any male body, and the thought put him in a foul mood. Not until late that night, at home, did he admit to her he was jealous.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="早在她发现他和萨比娜通信之前，他们曾和几个朋友一起去过一家酒吧。大家庆贺特蕾莎有了份新的工作。她离开了相片冲洗室，成了杂志社的一名摄影师。因为他不喜欢跳舞，医院的一个年轻同事就陪特蕾莎跳。他们优雅地滑入舞池，特蕾莎显得比以往任何时候都美。他不胜惊讶，看到她心领神会无比精确而又温顺地配合着舞伴。这支舞仿佛在宣告，她的忠诚，她对在托马斯眼中看到的每一个热望的满足，并不一定要只维系在他托马斯一人身上，而是随时准备迎合她能遇见的无论哪个男人的召唤。谁都不难把特蕾莎和这个年轻同事想象成一对情人。正是这种极易想象的可能性在刺伤他！特蕾莎的身体在别的男人的怀中充满爱恋地紧紧抱着，这完全可以想象，而这一想法让他的心情糟透了。深夜回家后，他向她承认他很嫉妒。">查看中文翻译</div>
