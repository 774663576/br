<div class="line_en">If Kreacher could escape a lake full of Inferi, Harry was confident that the capture of Mundungus would take a few hours at most, and he prowled the house all morning in a state of high anticipation. However, Kreacher did not return that morning or even that afternoon. By nightfall, Harry felt discouraged and anxious, and a supper composed largely of moldy bread, upon which Hermione had tried a variety of unsuccessful Transfigurations, did nothing to help.</div>

<div class="line_en">The presence of the Death Eaters outside increased the ominous mood inside number twelve. They had not heard a word from anyone beyond Grimmauld Place since Mr. Weasley's Patronus, and the strain was starting to tell. Restless and irritable, Ron had developed an annoying habit of playing with the Deluminator in his pocket: This particularly infuriated Hermione, who was whiling away the wait for Kreacher by studying The Tales of Beedle the Bard and did not appreciate the way the lights kept flashing on and off.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="外面的食死徒增加了12号宅子中的不祥气氛。从韦斯莱先生的守护神来过之后，他们没有听到过格里莫广场以外任何人的音信，压抑感开始表现出来。罗恩烦燥不安，多了个爱玩衣袋里那个熄灯器的恼人习惯，这让赫敏大为不满，她一边读着《诗翁彼豆故事集》一边等待克利切，很是讨厌灯光忽明忽暗。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Every nerve in his body seemed to tauten: He pulled out his wand, moved into the shadows beside the decapitated elf heads, and waited. The door opened: He saw a glimpse of the lamplit square outside, and a cloaked figure edged into the hall and closed the door behind it. The intruder took a step forward, and Moody's voice asked, "Severus Snape?" Then the dust figure rose from the end of the hall and rushed him, raising its dead hand.</div>

He headed downstairs toward the kitchen, which he kept visiting because he was sure that was where Kreacher was most likely to reappear. Halfway down the flight of stairs into the hall, however, he heard a tap on the front door, then metallic clicks and the grinding of the chain.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“都有。他们现在实际上是一回事了。”卢平说，“有十来个人，但他们不知道你在场，哈利。亚瑟听到传言说，他们在杀死斯克林杰之前，曾经给他用刑拷问过你的下落，如果真有此事，他没有出声你。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"He doesn't need to, Ron. Effectively he is the Minister, but why should he sit behind a desk at the Ministry? His puppet, Thicknesse, is taking care of everyday business, leaving Voldemort free to extend his power beyond the Ministry.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Naturally many people have deduced what has happened: There has been such a dramatic change in Ministry policy in the last few days, and many are whispering that Voldemort must be behind it. However, that is the point: They whisper. They daren't confide in each other, not knowing whom to trust; they are scared to speak out, in case their suspicions are true and their families are targeted. Yes, Voldemort is playing a very clever game. Declaring himself might have provoked open rebellion: Remaining masked has created confusion, uncertainty, and fear."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“许多人自然推测到发生的事情：几天来魔法部的政策变化太大了，他们私下里说一定是伏地魔在幕后指使。但问题就在这里，他们只是私下里说，不敢互相交心，不知道谁可以相信。他们不敢畅所欲言，怕万一怀疑的情况属实，家人会受到迫害。伏地魔这一着棋非常聪明。宣布篡位也许会引来公开的反抗，躲在幕后却能造成迷惑、猜疑和恐惧。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That's certainly part of it," said Lupin, "and it is a masterstroke. Now that Dumbledore is dead, you -- the Boy Who Lived -- were sure to be the symbol and rallying point for any resistance to Voldemort. But by suggesting that you had a hand in the old hero's death, Voldemort has not only set a price upon your head, but sown doubt and fear amongst many who would have defended you.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这确实是其中的一部分，”卢平说，“这是一手绝招。邓布利多死后，你——大难不死的男孩——必然会成为反抗伏地魔的象征和号召。而通过暗示你与老英雄之死有干系，伏地魔不仅可以悬赏缉拿你，而且在许多本来可能维护你的人中间撒下了怀疑和恐惧的种子。”">查看中文翻译</div>

Of course, nearly every witch and wizard in Britain has been educated at Hogwarts, but their parents had the right to teach them at home or send them abroad if they preferred. This way, Voldemort will have the whole Wizarding population under his eye from a young age.

<div class="line_en">The silent kitchen seemed to hum with the shock of the recent scene and with Ron and Hermione's unspoken reproaches. The Daily Prophet Lupin had brought was still lying on the table, Harry's own face staring up at the ceiling from the front page. He walked over to it and sat down, opened the paper at random, and pretended to read. He could not take in the words; his mind was still too full of the encounter with Lupin. He was sure that Ron and Hermione had resumed their silent communications on the other side of the Prophet. He turned a page loudly, and Dumbledore's name leapt out at him. It was a moment or two before he took in the meaning of the photograph, which showed a family group. Beneath the photograph were the words: The Dumbledore family, left to right: Albus; Percival, holding newborn Ariana; Kendra; and Aberforth.</div>

<div class="line_en">His attention caught, Harry examined the picture more carefully. Dumbledore's father, Percival, was a good-looking man with eyes that seemed to twinkle even in this faded old photograph. The baby, Ariana, was little longer than a loaf of bread and no more distinctive-looking. The mother, Kendra, had jet-black hair pulled into a high bun. Her face had a carved quality about it. Harry thought of photos of Native Americans he'd seen as he studied her dark eyes, high cheekbones, and straight nose, formally composed above a high-necked silk gown. Albus and Aberforth wore matching lacy collared jackets and had identical, shoulder-length hairstyles. Albus looked several years older, but otherwise the two boys looked very alike, for this was before Albus's nose had been broken and before he started wearing glasses.</div>

By repeatedly rebuffing the friendly advances of her new Wizarding neighbors, she soon ensured that her family was left wellalone.</div>

<div class="line_en">It seems that Kendra thought the move to Godric's Hollow was the perfect opportunity to hide Ariana once and for all, something she had probably been planning for years. The timing was significant. Ariana was barely seven years old when she vanished from sight, and seven is the age by which most experts agree that magic will have revealed itself, if present. Nobody now alive remembers Ariana ever demonstrating even the slightest sign of magical ability. It seems clear, therefore, that Kendra made a decision to hide her daughter's existence rather than suffer the shame of admitting that she had produced a Squib. Moving away from the friends and neighbors who knew Ariana would, of course, make imprisoning her all the easier. The tiny number of people who henceforth knew of Ariana's existence could be counted upon to keep the secret, including her two brothers, who deflected awkward questions with the answer their mother had taught them: "My sister is too frail for school."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="看样子坎德拉认为搬到戈德里克山谷是隐藏阿利安娜的良机，这件事她或许已经筹划多年。时机很重要，阿利安娜消失时刚刚七岁，而许多专家认为七岁是魔法能力应该显露的年龄。没有一位在世的人记得阿利安娜显示过丝毫的魔法能力。由此可见，坎德拉决定隐瞒女儿的存在，而羞于承认她生了一个哑炮。当然，离开认识阿利安娜的朋友和邻居，囚禁她就容易得多了。此后知道阿利安娜存在的人屈指可数，都是能保守秘密的，其中包括她的两个哥哥，他们用母亲教的话挡住尴尬的问题：“我妹妹身体太弱，上不了学。”">查看中文翻译</div>

His immediate thought was that Lupin had burst back into the room, and for a split second, he did not take in the mass of struggling limbs that had appeared out of thin air right beside his chair.
