<div class="line_en">Sam roused himself painfully from the ground. For a moment he wondered where he was, and then all the misery and despair returned to him. He was in the deep dark outside the under-gate of the orcs' stronghold; its brazen doors were shut. He must have fallen stunned when he hurled himself against them; but how long he had lain there he did not know. Then he had been on fire, desperate and furious; now he was shivering and cold. He crept to the doors and pressed his ears against them.</div>

<div class="line_en">Far within he could hear faintly the voices of orcs clamouring, but soon they stopped or passed out of hearing, and all was still. His head ached and his eyes saw phantom lights in the darkness, but he struggled to steady himself and think. It was clear at any rate that he had no hope of getting into the orc-hold by that gate; he might wait there for days before it was opened, and he could not wait: time was desperately precious. He no longer had any doubt about his duty: he must rescue his master or perish in the attempt.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他可以听见远处传来微弱的半兽人走动声，但很快的它们就渐行渐远，最后再也听不见了。他的头很痛，眼前有各式各样的幻影在黑暗中跳来跳去，但他还是努力挣扎，在黑暗中冷静下来，仔细思考眼前的处境。很明显的，他目前完全不可能从这个入口进入半兽人的堡垒，它可能好几天之后才会打开，而他不能再等下去了，时间非常宝贵、也非常紧迫。他对自己的任务已经不再有任何的怀疑，他必须救出主人，即使牺牲生命也在所不惜！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The perishing is more likely, and will be a lot easier anyway," he said grimly to himself, as he sheathed Sting and turned from the brazen doors. Slowly he groped his way back in the dark along the tunnel, not daring to use the elven-light; and as he went he tried to fit together the events since Frodo and he had left the Cross-roads. He wondered what the time was. Somewhere between one day and the next, he supposed; but even of the days he had quite lost count. He was in a land of darkness where the days of the world seemed forgotten, and where all who entered were forgotten too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“牺牲生命是最有可能的结果，而且也是最简单的选择。”当他收起宝剑刺针，转身离开铜门时，他神情凝重地对自己说。他不敢动用精灵的星光，只能在黑暗的隧道中摸索着离开。在此同时，他试着拼凑起自从佛罗多和他离开十字路口后所发生的一连串事件。他连现在是什么时刻都不知道了，应该是快要第二天了吧，他想，但是，他连这中间过了多少天都不能确定了。他在一个黑暗充斥的国度，在这边，现实世界的时间似乎早已被遗忘，而走进这国度的人也会跟着一起被遗忘。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He came back at last to the stone door of the orc-passage, and still unable to discover the catch or bolt that held it, he scrambled over as before and dropped softly to the ground. Then he made his way stealthily to the outlet of Shelob's tunnel, where the rags of her great web were still blowing and swaying in the cold airs. For cold they seemed to Sam after the noisome darkness behind; but the breath of them revived him. He crept cautiously out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后，他好不容易回到半兽人通道的入口石门，同样还是找不到是什么机关让它关得这么紧；因此，他照旧用之前的老方法爬了过去，身轻如燕地跳下来。接着，他悄无声息地来到了尸罗巢穴的出口，它那张巨网的残骸依旧在冷风中迎风飞舞。在经历了之前让人透不过气的黑暗之后，这里的风让他冷得直打哆嗦，不过，这也让他清醒许多，山姆小心翼翼地走了出去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I wonder if they think of us at all," he said, "and what is happening to them all away there." He waved his hand vaguely in the air before him; but he was in fact now facing southwards, as he came back to Shelob's tunnel, not west. Out westward in the world it was drawing to noon upon the fourteenth day of March in the Shire-reckoning, and even now Aragorn was leading the black fleet from Pelargir, and Merry was riding with the Rohirrim down the Stonewain Valley, while in Minas Tirith flames were rising and Pippin watched the madness growing in the eyes of Denethor. Yet amid all their cares and fear the thoughts of their friends turned constantly to Frodo and Sam. They were not forgotten. But they were far beyond aid, and no thought could yet bring any help to Samwise Hamfast's son; he was utterly alone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不知道他们会不会想到我们，”他说：“现在他们的状况又是怎么样？”他对着眼前随意比划着。事实上，他面对的方向是南方，正朝着尸罗巢穴，而不是西方。在外面西方的世界里，这时间正是夏垦历法的三月十二日，亚拉冈正带领着黑色舰队从佩拉格离开，梅里正和骠骑进入石车谷，米那斯提力斯陷入火海，皮聘看着迪耐瑟眼中的疯狂之色逐渐累积…即使在这忧患的处境中，他们的朋友还是会不时地想到佛罗多和山姆。他们并没有被遗忘，但是，没有人能够对他们伸出援手，光是想念还不足以帮助山姆卫斯，山姆此刻陷入完全孤立无援的处境。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">All was ominously quiet. The light was no more than that of dusk at a dark day's end. The vast vapours that arose in Mordor and went streaming westward passed low overhead, a great welter of cloud and smoke now lit again beneath with a sullen glow of red.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="万籁俱寂，他眼前的亮度约莫只有乌云笼罩下的日落这种程度。从魔多冒出的黑烟掠过低空，飘向西方，他可以看见底下的乌云被红色的火光照亮，整个被染成暗红色。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sam looked up towards the orc-tower, and suddenly from its narrow windows lights stared out like small red eyes. He wondered if they were some signal. His fear of the orcs, forgotten for a while in his wrath and desperation, now returned. As far as he could see, there was only one possible course for him to take: he must go on and try to find the main entrance to the dreadful tower; but his knees felt weak, and he found that he was trembling. Drawing his eyes down from the tower and the horns of the Cleft before him, he forced his unwilling feet to obey him, and slowly, listening with all his ears, peering into the dense shadows of the rocks beside the way, he retraced his steps, past the place where Frodo fell, and still the stench of Shelob lingered, and then on and up, until he stood again in the very cleft where he had put on the Ring and seen Shagrat's company go by.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山姆抬起头看着半兽人的高塔，从它小小的窗户中突然冒出了红光，不知道这是否是某种讯号？之前由于他的狂怒而忘却的恐惧，现在又重新回到他的心头。极目所及之处，他只有一个可能的道路可以选择：山姆必须要找到这个丑陋高塔的正门。可是，他觉得两腿无力，浑身止不住地发抖。他把视线从眼前让人胆寒的景象移开，强迫自己一步一步的往前走。他专注着听着身边的一切声响，观察着附近所有的缝隙和阴影，在尸罗的腐臭之气笼罩下，走回佛罗多倒下的地方；然后他继续往上走，来到他戴上魔戒、看着夏格拉的队伍经过的山坳。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As before, Sam found that his hearing was sharpened, but that to his sight the things of this world seemed thin and vague. The rocky walls of the path were pale, as if seen through a mist, but still at a distance he heard the bubbling of Shelob in her misery; and harsh and clear, and very close it seemed, he heard cries and the clash of metal. He sprang to his feet, and pressed himself against the wall beside the road. He was glad of the Ring, for here was yet another company of orcs on the march. Or so at first he thought. Then suddenly he realized that it was not so, his hearing had deceived him: the orc-cries came from the tower, whose topmost horn was now right above him, on the left hand of the Cleft.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="和之前一样，山姆立刻觉得自己的听力被放大许多，但眼前的世界却变得模糊不清。山道的岩壁显得相当苍白，彷佛是隔了一层迷雾，但是，他依旧可以听见远方的尸罗痛苦哀嚎的声音；在非常靠近的地方，他似乎可以听见叫喊声和兵器互相撞击的声响。他跳了起来，立刻紧贴在岩壁上不敢动弹。他很高兴有魔戒的帮助，因为眼前又来了另一群半兽人。一开始他是这样以为的，然后，他才意识到并不是这样，他又被自己的听力给搞混了，半兽人的呼喊声是来自于高塔中，现在塔顶就在他头上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There he halted and sat down. For the moment he could drive himself no further. He felt that if once he went beyond the crown of the pass and took one step veritably down into the land of Mordor, that step would be irrevocable. He could never come back. Without any clear purpose he drew out the Ring and put it on again. Immediately he felt the great burden of its weight, and felt afresh, but now more strong and urgent than ever, the malice of the Eye of Mordor, searching, trying to pierce the shadows that it had made for its own defence, but which now hindered it in its unquiet and doubt.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他在那里停下脚步，坐了下来，他已经走不动了。他有种感觉，如果自己走过这个隘口，朝向魔多踏出一步，他就再也无法回头了，他永远不能离开那个黑暗的国度。他毫无理由的拿出魔戒，再度戴上，在同一瞬间，他立刻感觉到它的沉重，同时，也更清楚的感觉到魔多之眼在自己制造出来的黑影中焦躁的搜寻、调查着，希望能够确认这一切不安和疑惑的来源。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sam shuddered and tried to force himself to move. There was plainly some devilry going on. Perhaps in spite of all orders the cruelty of the orcs had mastered them, and they were tormenting Frodo, or even savagely hacking him to pieces. He listened; and as he did so a gleam of hope came to him. There could not be much doubt: there was fighting in the tower, the orcs must be at war among themselves, Shagrat and Gorbag had come to blows. Faint as was the hope that his guess brought him, it was enough to rouse him. There might be just a chance. His love for Frodo rose above all other thoughts, and forgetting his peril he cried aloud: "I'm coming, Mr. Frodo!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山姆打了个寒颤，试着强迫自己往前走，很明显出了什么状况。或许这些半兽人摆脱了上级严格的命令，让他们残酷的天性主导一切，目前正在虐待佛罗多，甚至是把他残忍地乱刀砍死。他继续听着，渐渐的，心中燃起了一丝希望。他很确定高塔中起了争斗，这些半兽人一定窝里反了，夏格拉和哥巴葛的部下打起来了。虽然这只是很渺茫的希望，但也足以让他再度鼓起勇气，这或许是唯一的机会。他对佛罗多的敬爱之情压下了一切其他的情绪，他忘记自身所处的危险，放声高呼道：“佛罗多先生，我来了！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sam was looking at Orodruin, the Mountain of Fire. Ever and anon the furnaces far below its ashen cone would grow hot and with a great surging and throbbing pour forth rivers of molten rock from chasms in its sides. Some would flow blazing towards Barad-dûr down great channels; some would wind their way into the stony plain, until they cooled and lay like twisted dragon-shapes vomited from the tormented earth. In such an hour of labour Sam beheld Mount Doom, and the light of it, cut off by the high screen of the Ephel Dúath from those who climbed up the path from the West, now glared against the stark rock faces, so that they seemed to be drenched with blood.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在山姆眼前的是欧洛都因，也就是火焰之山。底下的熔炉不时会喷出高热、致命、剧毒的岩浆，蔓延过附近的地面。有些岩浆会沿着巨大的沟渠流向巴拉多，有些则是蜿蜒地流上多岩的平原，最后，在它们冷却之后，看起来会像是大地所吐出的恐怖石龙。疲倦的山姆现在所看到的是末日裂隙剧烈活动时的景象，它的光芒被伊菲尔杜斯的山势所阻挡，让从西方而来的人只能看见彷佛泡在鲜血中的山壁。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Hard and cruel and bitter was the land that met his gaze. Before his feet the highest ridge of the Ephel Dúath fell steeply in great cliffs down into a dark trough, on the further side of which there rose another ridge, much lower, its edge notched and jagged with crags like fangs that stood out black against the red light behind them: it was the grim Morgai, the inner ring of the fences of the land. Far beyond it, but almost straight ahead, across a wide lake of darkness dotted with tiny fires, there was a great burning glow; and from it rose in huge columns a swirling smoke, dusty red at the roots, black above where it merged into the billowing canopy that roofed in all the accursed land.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他眼前的大地看起来寸草不生，毫无一丝生气，就在他的脚前，伊菲尔杜斯的山势形成陡峭的悬崖往下直落，落入一道山沟，在山沟的另外一边又是高起的山丘，但这山丘凹凸不平，看起来像是利爪的尖端一样让人极端不舒服，这是摩盖，这黑暗国度第二圈的防御。在那之后则是一个黑暗的大湖，上面点缀着几点火星；那里有着非常大的火势，从那团烈火中升起了大得惊人的烟柱，翻滚着飞上天空。烟柱的底端是暗红色的，上端则构成了笼罩这黑暗大地的天顶。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In that dreadful light Sam stood aghast, for now, looking to his left, he could see the Tower of Cirith Ungol in all its strength. The horn that he had seen from the other side was only its topmost turret. Its eastern face stood up in three great tiers from a shelf in the mountain-wall far below; its back was to a great cliff behind, from which it jutted out in pointed bastions, one above the other, diminishing as they rose, with sheer sides of cunning masonry that looked north-east and south-east. About the lowest tier, two hundred feet below where Sam now stood, there was a battlemented wall enclosing a narrow court. Its gate, upon the near south-eastern side, opened on a broad road, the outer parapet of which ran upon the brink of a precipice, until it turned southward and went winding down into the darkness to join the road that came over the Morgul Pass. Then on it went through a jagged rift in the Morgai out into the valley of Gorgoroth and away to Barad-dûr. The narrow upper way on which Sam stood leapt swiftly down by stair and steep path to meet the main road under the frowning walls close to the Tower-gate.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在这恐怖的光芒中，山姆呆立着，当他转向左边时，他可以看见那恐怖阴森的西力斯昂哥塔，他从另外一边看见的岩角不过是它最高的尖塔。它的东面有三个从底下山壁延伸出来的巨大楼层，背靠着另一个高耸峭壁，这座峭壁上有一层层逐渐退缩的庞大堡垒，面对东南方和东北方的墙壁，平滑得让苍蝇也难以停留。在最底下的一层，也就是山姆脚下两百尺的地方，有座被城墙包围的广场，出口则是在东南方，面对着一条宽广的道路。城墙的外塔建筑在绝壁的边缘，俯瞰着这条路和通往魔窟谷的大道会合。这条路的另一个方向穿越一段崎岖的地形，进入了葛哥洛斯盆地，通往巴拉多。山姆所在的这条小路有道往下的陡峭阶梯，在塔门外和大道会合。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Only too clearly Sam saw how hopeless it would be for him to creep down under those many-eyed walls and pass the watchful gate. And even if he did so, he could not go far on the guarded road beyond: not even the black shadows, lying deep where the red glow could not reach, would shield him long from the night-eyed orcs. But desperate as that road might be, his task was now far worse: not to avoid the gate and escape, but to enter it, alone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山姆非常明白要越过这在严密监视下的高塔，进入那大门有多么困难。即使他做到了，在底下那条重兵看守的道路上他也走不远：连这浓重的黑暗，也无法让他躲过拥有夜视能力的半兽人。不过，最糟糕的是，他的任务并不是要躲开守卫逃出去，而是单枪匹马闯进高塔。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As he gazed at it suddenly Sam understood, almost with a shock, that this stronghold had been built not to keep enemies out of Mordor, but to keep them in. It was indeed one of the works of Gondor long ago, an eastern outpost of the defences of Ithilien, made when, after the Last Alliance, Men of Westernesse kept watch on the evil land of Sauron where his creatures still lurked. But as with Narchost and Carchost, the Towers of the Teeth, so here too the vigilance had failed, and treachery had yielded up the Tower to the Lord of the Ringwraiths, and now for long years it had been held by evil things. Since his return to Mordor, Sauron had found it useful; for he had few servants but many slaves of fear, and still its chief purpose as of old was to prevent escape from Mordor. Though if an enemy were so rash as to try to enter that land secretly, then it was also a last unsleeping guard against any that might pass the vigilance of Morgul and of Shelob.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当他看着眼前的道路时，山姆这才吃惊地明白，这座塔建造的目的不是为了让外人不能进入，而是为了将敌人关在里面。事实上，这是刚铎许久以前所建造的堡垒，是伊西立安东方的前哨站，在最后联盟的大战之后，西方皇族的人类为了监视索伦属下的生物依旧潜伏的这块大陆所兴建的。但是，这和牙之塔一样，人们松懈了，戒灵接管了这些高塔，它已经被邪恶的生物占领了许多年。在索伦回归魔多之后，他觉得这些高塔非常不错，因为他的仆人很少，大多是被恐惧所驱使的奴隶，所以这座高塔的目的依旧和古代一样，是为了避免人们逃出魔多。不过，如果有敌人试图秘密潜入魔多，这是在魔窟谷和尸罗的巢穴之外最后的防御阵线。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">His thought turned to the Ring, but there was no comfort there, only dread and danger. No sooner had he come in sight of Mount Doom, burning far away, than he was aware of a change in his burden. As it drew near the great furnaces where, in the deeps of time, it had been shaped and forged, the Ring's power grew, and it became more fell, untameable save by some mighty will. As Sam stood there, even though the Ring was not on him but hanging by its chain about his neck, he felt himself enlarged, as if he were robed in a huge distorted shadow of himself, a vast and ominous threat halted upon the walls of Mordor. He felt that he had from now on only two choices: to forbear the Ring, though it would torment him; or to claim it, and challenge the Power that sat in its dark hold beyond the valley of shadows. Already the Ring tempted him, gnawing at his will and reason. Wild fantasies arose in his mind; and he saw Samwise the Strong, Hero of the Age, striding with a flaming sword across the darkened land, and armies flocking to his call as he marched to the overthrow of Barad-dûr. And then all the clouds rolled away, and the white sun shone, and at his command the vale of Gorgoroth became a garden of flowers and trees and brought forth fruit. He had only to put on the Ring and claim it for his own, and all this could be.</div>

<div class="line_en">In that hour of trial it was the love of his master that helped most to hold him firm; but also deep down in him lived still unconquered his plain hobbit-sense: he knew in the core of his heart that he was not large enough to bear such a burden, even if such visions were not a mere cheat to betray him. The one small garden of a free gardener was all his need and due, not a garden swollen to a realm; his own hands to use, not the hands of others to command.</div>

<div class="line_en">He was not really in any doubt. He knew that he must go down to the gate and not linger any more. With a shrug of his shoulders, as if to shake off the shadow and dismiss the phantoms, he began slowly to descend. With each step he seemed to diminish. He had not gone far before he had shrunk again to a very small and frightened hobbit.

<div class="line_en">He crept on; and as he went he wondered how many orcs lived in the Tower with Shagrat, and how many Gorbag had, and what they were quarrelling about, if that was what was happening. Shagrat's company had seemed to be about forty, and Gorbag's more than twice as large; but of course Shagrat's patrol had only been a part of his garrison. Almost certainly they were quarrelling about Frodo, and the spoil. For a second Sam halted, for suddenly things seemed clear to him, almost as if he had seen them with his eyes. The mithril coat! Of course, Frodo was wearing it, and they would find it. And from what Sam had heard Gorbag would covet it. But the orders of the Dark Tower were at present Frodo's only protection, and if they were set aside, Frodo might be killed out of hand at any moment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他继续小心翼翼地前进，同时他忍不住想着，高塔中究竟有多少夏格拉的人马？哥巴葛又有多少兵力？他们到底在争执什么？里面究竟发生了什么事情？夏格拉的队伍大概有四十人，但哥巴葛的人数几乎有两倍之多，不过，夏格拉的巡逻队只是他管辖部队的一部分，他们多半是为了佛罗多和战利品而争吵。山姆停下了脚步，他突然间想通了，里面的景象清楚地浮现在他眼前：秘银锁子甲！一定是这样！佛罗多穿着它，绝对会被他们发现的。从山姆所听到的片段来看，哥巴葛一定会想要将它据为己有。魔多的命令可说是佛罗多唯一的护身符，如果他们决定不管上级的命令，佛罗多随时都可能被杀。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sam was about half way down the path when out of the dark gateway into the red glow there came two orcs running. They did not turn towards him. They were making for the main road; but even as they ran they stumbled and fell to the ground and lay still. Sam had seen no arrows, but he guessed that the orcs had been shot down by others on the battlements or hidden in the shadow of the gate. He went on, hugging the wall on his left. One look upward had shown him that there was no hope of climbing it. The stone-work rose thirty feet, without a crack or ledge, to overhanging courses like inverted steps. The gate was the only way.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山姆正爬到一半，突然有两名半兽人从黑暗中跑了出来，他们并不是跑向他，这两人是跑向大路，不过，没跑多远，两个人就踉跄倒地，再也没有爬起来过。山姆没有看见攻击的人，但他推测这两个家伙多半是被躲在墙内或是阴影处的敌人给射死了。他继续前进，紧靠着左边的墙壁。他抬头看了一眼，就知道完全不可能爬上去。这座石墙几乎有三十尺高，上面没有任何的空隙，最要命的是，最上面还做成像是颠倒阶梯的形状，大门是唯一的入口。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Come on, you miserable sluggard!" Sam cried to himself. "Now for it!" He drew Sting and ran towards the open gate. But just as he was about to pass under its great arch he felt a shock: as if he had run into some web like Shelob's, only invisible. He could see no obstacle, but something too strong for his will to overcome barred the way. He looked about, and then within the shadow of the gate he saw the Two Watchers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“快点啊，你这个慢吞吞的家伙！”山姆自言自语道：“快跑啊！”他拔出刺针，冲向敝开的大门，但是，正当他准备要闯进门内时，突然觉得一阵战栗，彷佛他撞上了尸罗的蛛网，只不过这是隐形的；他看不见是什么阻挡了去路，只知道某种坚韧到让他无法突破的力量挡在前面。他打量着四周，在门旁的阴影中看见了两名监视者。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Hardening his will Sam thrust forward once again, and halted with a jerk, staggering as if from a blow upon his breast and head. Then greatly daring, because he could think of nothing else to do, answering a sudden thought that came to him, he drew slowly out the phial of Galadriel and held it up. Its white light quickened swiftly, and the shadows under the dark arch fled. The monstrous Watchers sat there cold and still, revealed in all their hideous shape. For a moment Sam caught a glitter in the black stones of their eyes, the very malice of which made him quail; but slowly he felt their will waver and crumble into fear.</div>

<div class="line_en">They were like great figures seated upon thrones. Each had three joined bodies, and three heads facing outward, and inward, and across the gateway.

Visible or invisible none could pass unheeded. They would forbid his entry, or his escape.</div>

It was dimly lit with torches flaring in brackets on the walls, but its distant end was lost in gloom. Many doors and openings could be seen on this side and that; but it was empty save for two or three more bodies sprawling on the floor. From what he had heard of the captains' talk Sam knew that, dead or alive, Frodo would most likely be found in a chamber high up in the turret far above; but he might search for a day before he found the way.</div>

He stopped short. Then he heard feet coming. Someone was running in great haste down an echoing stairway overhead.</div>

<div class="line_en">He advanced down the passage, but slowly now, each step more reluctant. Terror was beginning to grip him again. There was no sound save the rap of his feet, which seemed to grow to an echoing noise, like the slapping of great hands upon the stones. The dead bodies; the emptiness; the dank black walls that in the torchlight seemed to drip with blood; the fear of sudden death lurking in doorway or shadow; and behind all his mind the waiting watchful malice at the gate: it was almost more than he could screw himself to face. He would have welcomed a fight -- with not too many enemies at a time -- rather than this hideous brooding uncertainty. He forced himself to think of Frodo, lying bound or in pain or dead somewhere in this dreadful place. He went on.</div>

<div class="line_en">His will was too weak and slow to restrain his hand. It dragged at the chain and clutched the Ring. But Sam did not put it on; for even as he clasped it to his breast, an orc came clattering down. Leaping out of a dark opening at the right, it ran towards him. It was no more than six paces from him when, lifting its head, it saw him; and Sam could hear its gasping breath and see the glare in its bloodshot eyes. It stopped short aghast. For what it saw was not a small frightened hobbit trying to hold a steady sword: it saw a great silent shape, cloaked in a grey shadow, looming against the wavering light behind; in one hand it held a sword, the very light of which was a bitter pain, the other was clutched at its breast, but held concealed some nameless menace of power and doom.</div>

"If only they all take such a dislike to me and my Sting, this may turn out better than I hoped. And anyway it looks as if Shagrat, Gorbag, and company have done nearly all my job for me.

<div class="line_cn" title="他不停地往上爬，除了转角偶尔插着的火把和窗户透进的些许光芒外，楼梯间一片黑暗。山姆试着计算到底有多少阶楼梯，但在两百阶之后他就数不下去了。他刻意放低音量，因为他觉得好像可以听见上面有人说话的声音，看来，恐怕不只一只老鼠留了下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">All at once, when he felt that he could pump out no more breath, nor force his knees to bend again, the stair ended. He stood still. The voices were now loud and near. Sam peered about. He had climbed right to the flat roof of the third and highest tier of the Tower: an open space, about twenty yards across, with a low parapet. There the stair was covered by a small domed chamber in the midst of the roof, with low doors facing east and west. Eastward Sam could see the plain of Mordor vast and dark below, and the burning mountain far away. A fresh turmoil was surging in its deep wells, and the rivers of fire blazed so fiercely that even at this distance of many miles the light of them lit the tower-top with a red glare. Westward the view was blocked by the base of the great turret that stood at the back of this upper court and reared its horn high above the crest of the encircling hills. Light gleamed in a window-slit. Its door was not ten yards from where Sam stood. It was open but dark, and from just within its shadow the voices came.</div>

<div class="line_en">"So that's it, is it?" yelled Shagrat. "You'll do this, and you'll not do that? And when he does come, you'll bolt and leave me? No, you won't! I'll put red maggot-holes in your belly first."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是吗？是这样吗？”夏格拉大喊道：“你想做什么就做什么？当他来的时候，你会丢下我逃走？不，不行！我要先杀了你！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Out of the turret-door the smaller orc came flying. Behind him came Shagrat, a large orc with long arms that, as he ran crouching, reached to the ground. But one arm hung limp and seemed to be bleeding; the other hugged a large black bundle. In the red glare Sam, cowering behind the stair-door, caught a glimpse of his evil face as it passed: it was scored as if by rending claws and smeared with blood; slaver dripped from its protruding fangs; the mouth snarled like an animal.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="矮小的半兽人从塔中逃了出来，高大的夏格拉追了出来，他的手臂很长，奔跑的时候会垂到地面；不过，他有一只手似乎不能动弹，上面还沾满了血液，另一只手则是抱着一个黑色的大包袱。山姆躲在暗处，藉着黯淡的红光趁他经过时看了他一眼：夏格拉的脸似乎被利爪抓伤，上面全都是鲜血；他的血盆大口中不断冒出唾液，像是野兽一样的大吼。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As far as Sam could see, Shagrat hunted Snaga round the roof, until ducking and eluding him the smaller orc with a yelp darted back into the turret and disappeared. Then Shagrat halted. Out of the eastward door Sam could see him now by the parapet, panting, his left claw clenching and unclenching feebly. He put the bundle on the floor and with his right claw drew out a long red knife and spat on it. Going to the parapet he leaned over, looking down into the outer court far below. Twice he shouted but no answer came.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在山姆面前，夏格拉在平台上拼命奔跑，追杀史那加，对方一路闪躲，最后冲进塔楼之中。夏格拉在门口停了下来，山姆注意到他不停地喘气，左手虚弱摆动着。他把包袱放到地板上，用右手拿出一柄细长的红色小刀，对着上面吐了口口水。他走到塔楼边，对着外面大喊了几声，但却没有丝毫回应。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Suddenly, as Shagrat was stooped over the battlement, his back to the roof-top, Sam to his amazement saw that one of the sprawling bodies was moving. It was crawling. It put out a claw and clutched the bundle. It staggered up. In its other hand it held a broad-headed spear with a short broken haft. It was poised for a stabbing thrust. But at that very moment a hiss escaped its teeth, a gasp of pain or hate. Quick as a snake Shagrat slipped aside, twisted round, and drove his knife into his enemy's throat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然间，正当夏格拉靠着矮墙打量着底下的广场时，山姆惊讶地发现有一具尸体开始移动。他缓缓地往前爬，接着伸出手，抓住那包袱──他踉跄地站了起来，在另外一只手中握着一柄底部折断的长矛，他瞄准目标，准备奋力一刺。就在那一瞬间，他吸了一口气，可能是因为疼痛或是愤怒；夏格拉立刻像蛇一般敏捷地闪到一边，反转过身，一刀刺进敌人的咽喉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Got you, Gorbag!" he cried. "Not quite dead, eh? Well, I'll finish my job now." He sprang on to the fallen body, and stamped and trampled it in his fury, stooping now and again to stab and slash it with his knife. Satisfied at last, he threw back his head and let out a horrible gurgling yell of triumph. Then he licked his knife, and put it between his teeth, and catching up the bundle he came loping towards the near door of the stairs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“逮到你了吧，哥巴葛！”他大喊着：“还没死透吗？哼，我可是有始有终的！”他一脚把敌人踹开，开始在对方的尸体上又砍又踩，发泄那野蛮的怒气。最后，他终于满意了，抬起头发出野兽般的狂嚎；接着，他舔舔刀子，用牙齿将它咬住，拿起包袱蹒跚地走向楼梯。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sam had no time to think. He might have slipped out of the other door, but hardly without being seen; and he could not have played hide-and-seek with this hideous orc for long. He did what was probably the best thing he could have done. He sprang out to meet Shagrat with a shout. He was no longer holding the Ring, but it was there, a hidden power, a cowing menace to the slaves of Mordor; and in his hand was Sting, and its light smote the eyes of the orc like the glitter of cruel stars in the terrible elf-countries, the dream of which was a cold fear to all his kind. And Shagrat could not both fight and keep hold of his treasure. He stopped, growling, baring his fangs. Then once more, orc-fashion, he leapt aside, and as Sam sprang at him, using the heavy bundle as both shield and weapon, he thrust it hard into his enemy's face. Sam staggered, and before he could recover, Shagrat darted past and down the stairs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山姆不及多想，他或许可以溜出去，但多半会被对方发现，他也不可能和这个半兽人一直玩捉迷藏，他只有一个选择。他跳了出去，大吼一声面对夏格拉！他不再握着魔戒，但魔戒依旧在他身上，那股隐藏的黑暗力量并没有消失，光是这样就足以让魔多的奴隶低头；况且，他的另外一只手还拿着刺针。宝剑所发出的光芒，毫不留情的刺痛了半兽人的眼睛，这种带着精灵力量的东西是半兽人最可怕的梦魇，夏格拉不可能一面对抗他，一面还拿着宝物。他低吼着弯下腰，露出口中的獠牙，然后，再一次的，他和所有的半兽人一样躲向一旁，用那包袱当作盾牌兼武器，狠狠地打中敌人的面孔。山姆脚步一个踉跄，在他来得及站稳之前，夏格拉就冲进了楼梯间。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Away below Shagrat went leaping down the stairs and out over the court and through the gate, bearing his precious burden. If Sam could have seen him and known the grief that his escape would bring, he might have quailed. But now his mind was set on the last stage of his search. He came cautiously to the turret-door and stepped inside. It opened into darkness. But soon his staring eyes were aware of a dim light at his right hand. It came from an opening that led to another stairway, dark and narrow: it appeared to go winding up the turret along the inside of its round outer wall. A torch was glimmering from somewhere up above.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此时的夏格拉已经冲出了楼梯，背着宝贝的包袱来到了广场上。如果山姆发现了他，预知到他这一逃会让同伴们多么难过，山姆可能拼了命也要追上他，不过，此时他的心思全都集中在眼前的任务上。他小心地打开塔楼的门，走了进去，门内一片黑暗，不过，很快的，他的双眼就发现了右手边的微光。那是从一个通往另一道楼梯的入口所透出来的，那道楼梯又窄又暗，看起来似乎是沿着墙壁内部往上走，上面某处有支火把发出微弱的光芒。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sam ran after him, cursing, but he did not go far. Soon the thought of Frodo returned to him, and he remembered that the other orc had gone back into the turret. Here was another dreadful choice, and he had no time to ponder it. If Shagrat got away, he would soon get help and come back. But if Sam pursued him, the other orc might do some horrible deed up there. And anyway Sam might miss Shagrat or be killed by him. He turned quickly and ran back up the stairs. "Wrong again, I expect," he sighed. "But it's my job to go right up to the top first, whatever happens afterwards."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山姆咒骂着追了进去，但他没有追多远。很快的，他就想起了佛罗多，还有另外一名闯进塔楼里面的半兽人，这又是个两难的选择，而且他还没有多少时间可以考虑。如果夏格拉逃了出去，他很快就会找到帮手跑回来；但如果山姆去追他，另外一名半兽人可能会做出什么恐怖的事情来，而且，山姆可能根本追不上夏格拉，或是被他所杀。他很快地转过身，继续往楼上跑。“我想这次可能又错了，”他叹气道：“但不论如何，我都必须先上去，管它之后会发生什么事情！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He ran back to the lower storey and tried the door. It would not move. He ran up again, and sweat began to trickle down his face. He felt that even minutes were precious, but one by one they escaped; and he could do nothing. He cared no longer for Shagrat or Snaga or any other orc that was ever spawned. He longed only for his master, for one sight of his face or one touch of his hand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他又跑回底下一层，试着打开那边的门，却徒劳无功。他又跑了上去，大颗大颗的汗珠从他额前滴落下来，他连一分一秒都不敢浪费，但时间却毫不留情地流逝，而他束手无策，想不出任何办法来。他完全无力分神去想夏格拉、史那加或是其他的半兽人，他只想要找到主人，只想要再看看他、再碰碰他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"A dead end," muttered Sam; "and after all my climb! This can't be the top of the tower. But what can I do now?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“死路，”山姆嘀咕着：“我爬了这么久！这里应该不是塔顶，我现在该怎么办？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Softly Sam began to climb. He came to the guttering torch, fixed above a door on his left that faced a window-slit looking out westward: one of the red eyes that he and Frodo had seen from down below by the tunnel's mouth. Quickly Sam passed the door and hurried on to the second storey, dreading at any moment to be attacked and to feel throttling fingers seize his throat from behind. He came next to a window looking east and another torch above the door to a passage through the middle of the turret. The door was open, the passage dark save for the glimmer of the torch and the red glare from outside filtering through the window-slit. But here the stair stopped and climbed no further. Sam crept into the passage. On either side there was a low door; both were closed and locked. There was no sound at all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山姆悄无声息地开始往上爬，他走到了那闪动不已的火把旁，火把插在他左手边的门上，面对着向西的一面窗户，这就是他和佛罗多之前，在外面所看到的许多红眼之一。山姆飞快走过门口，急忙来到二楼，担心随时都会遭到攻击，或是被无声无息的手从后勒住。接着，他又来到另一扇门、另一支火把前，这次窗户所面对的是东边，他人大概已经来到塔楼中段了。这扇门是开着的，外面的走道除了室外射入的微弱红光外，别无任何的照明，不过，阶梯不再往上爬了。两边都有一扇矮门，但也都紧闭着，还上了锁，四周一点声音也没有。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At last, weary and feeling finally defeated, he sat on a step below the level of the passage-floor and bowed his head into his hands. It was quiet, horribly quiet. The torch, that was already burning low when he arrived, sputtered and went out; and he felt the darkness cover him like a tide. And then softly, to his own surprise, there at the vain end of his long journey and his grief, moved by what thought in his heart he could not tell, Sam began to sing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后，他只得又累又无助地坐了下来，双手捧着头，不知该如何是好，四周很安静，安静得吓人。当他抵达时，已经烧了很久的火把，这时火焰摇晃了几下，也跟着熄灭了，他觉得黑暗如同潮水一般将他淹没；最后，由于这前功尽弃的挫折感，万念俱灰的山姆惊讶地发现自己竟然开口唱出了歌声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His voice sounded thin and quavering in the cold dark tower: the voice of a forlorn and weary hobbit that no listening orc could possibly mistake for the clear song of an Elven-lord. He murmured old childish tunes out of the Shire, and snatches of Mr. Bilbo's rhymes that came into his mind like fleeting glimpses of the country of his home. And then suddenly new strength rose in him, and his voice rang out, while words of his own came unbidden to fit the simple tune.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的声音在这黑暗、冰冷的塔中听来十分虚弱，同时还不停地颤抖。这是一名绝望、疲倦的小哈比人，没有任何半兽人听到这声音还会误认他是精灵战士。他呢喃着夏尔的儿歌、比尔博的诗句，故乡的情景一幕幕掠过他眼前；接着，他突然间觉得身体内有股新的力量苏醒了，他变得中气十足，从他脑中冒出的字句，自动填入这简单的曲调中：">查看中文翻译</div>

Yes, he could hear something, but not a voice. Footsteps were approaching. Now a door was being opened quietly in the passage above; the hinges creaked. Sam crouched down listening. The door closed with a dull thud; and then a snarling orc-voice rang out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“参天高塔未能覆…”他再度开始唱道，但却突然停了下来。他觉得自己听见一个微弱的声音回应他的歌声，但这时又什么都听不见了。没错，他可以听见某个声音，但那不是人声，而是脚步声。上面的走道有一扇门打开了，门枢发出转动的声音。山姆弯身仔细听着，那门喀达一声关了起来，一个刺耳的半兽人声音传了过来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At that rage blazed in Sam's heart to a sudden fury. He sprang up, ran, and went up the ladder like a cat. His head came out in the middle of the floor of a large round chamber. A red lamp hung from its roof; the westward window-slit was high and dark. Something was lying on the floor by the wall under the window, but over it a black orc-shape was straddled. It raised a whip a second time, but the blow never fell.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山姆胸中的怒火立刻爆发。他跳了出去，像是野猫一样敏捷地攀上楼梯。他的脑袋从一个圆形大房间的地板上伸了出来，天花板上挂着一盏红色的油灯，西边的窗户又高又暗，但有一个半兽人的身影站在旁边。对方又再度举起鞭子，但这一鞭再也无法落下。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The hinges creaked again, and Sam, now peering over the corner of the passage-threshold, saw a flicker of light in an open doorway, and the dim shape of an orc coming out. He seemed to be carrying a ladder. Suddenly the answer dawned on Sam: the topmost chamber was reached by a trap-door in the roof of the passage. Snaga thrust the ladder upwards, steadied it, and then clambered out of sight. Sam heard a bolt drawn back. Then he heard the hideous voice speaking again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="门枢再度发出转动的声音，山姆跑到门廊边，这次终于发现门廊中传来了一丝火光，一名半兽人走出外面，他似乎带着一具梯子。山姆突然间明白了：最上面的房间，必须透过天花板上的陷板门才能打开。史那加把梯子往上一戳，稳住两边，接着就爬了进去。山姆听见他拉开门闩的声音，然后，那刺耳的声音又开始了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">With a cry Sam leapt across the floor, Sting in hand. The orc wheeled round, but before it could make a move Sam slashed its whip-hand from its arm. Howling with pain and fear but desperate the orc charged head-down at him. Sam's next blow went wide, and thrown off his balance he fell backwards, clutching at the orc as it stumbled over him. Before he could scramble up he heard a cry and a thud. The orc in its wild haste had tripped on the ladder-head and fallen through the open trap-door. Sam gave no more thought to it. He ran to the figure huddled on the floor. It was Frodo.</div>

They stripped me of everything; and then two great brutes came and questioned me, questioned me until I thought I should go mad, standing over me, gloating, fingering their knives. I'll never forget their claws and eyes."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“不，其实不是每样东西，佛罗多先生，你的任务没有失败，至少暂时还没有。佛罗多先生，请你见谅，是我拿走的，我替你好好保管着──它就挂在我的脖子上，而且它还好沉重！”山姆拨弄着挂在练子上的魔戒。“但我想你一定得把它收回去了！”到了这个地步，山姆实在不想把魔戒还给主人，让他再承受这重担。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"All right, Mr. Frodo," said Sam, rather startled. "Here it is!" Slowly he drew the Ring out and passed the chain over his head.

<div class="line_en">"No, no!" cried Frodo, snatching the Ring and chain from Sam's hands. "No you won't, you thief!" He panted, staring at Sam with eyes wide with fear and enmity. Then suddenly, clasping the Ring in one clenched fist, he stood aghast. A mist seemed to clear from his eyes, and he passed a hand over his aching brow. The hideous vision had seemed so real to him, half bemused as he was still with wound and fear. Sam had changed before his very eyes into an orc again, leering and pawing at his treasure, a foul little creature with greedy eyes and slobbering mouth. But now the vision had passed. There was Sam kneeling before him, his face wrung with pain, as if he had been stabbed in the heart; tears welled from his eyes.</div>

<div class="line_en">He opened the bundle. Frodo looked in disgust at the contents, but there was nothing for it: he had to put the things on, or go naked. There were long hairy breeches of some unclean beast-fell, and a tunic of dirty leather. He drew them on. Over the tunic went a coat of stout ring-mail, short for a full-sized orc, too long for Frodo and heavy. About it he clasped a belt, at which there hung a short sheath holding a broad-bladed stabbing-sword. Sam had brought several orc-helmets. One of them fitted Frodo well enough, a black cap with iron rim, and iron hoops covered with leather upon which the Evil Eye was painted in red above the beaklike nose-guard.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Gilthoniel, A Elbereth!" Sam cried. For, why he did not know, his thought sprang back suddenly to the Elves in the Shire, and the song that drove away the Black Rider in the trees.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“姬尔松耐尔！伊尔碧绿丝！”不知道为什么，山姆突然间想起在夏尔遇到的精灵，以及驱赶走黑骑士的歌声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sam drew out the elven-glass of Galadriel again. As if to do honour to his hardihood, and to grace with splendour his faithful brown hobbit-hand that had done such deeds, the phial blazed forth suddenly, so that all the shadowy court was lit with a dazzling radiance like lightning; but it remained steady and did not pass.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山姆再度拿出凯兰崔尔赐给他们的星光瓶，彷佛是为了奖赏他的付出和努力，以及保护这两位哈比人，洁白的星光如同耀目的闪电一般洒满整个广场，但两名监视者依旧不为所动。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The will of the Watchers was broken with a suddenness like the snapping of a cord, and Frodo and Sam stumbled forward. Then they ran. Through the gate and past the great seated figures with their glittering eyes. There was a crack. The keystone of the arch crashed almost on their heels, and the wall above crumbled, and fell in ruin. Only by a hair did they escape. A bell clanged; and from the Watchers there went up a high and dreadful wail. Far up above in the darkness it was answered. Out of the black sky there came dropping like a bolt a winged shape, rending the clouds with a ghastly shriek.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="监视者的抵抗如同丝线一般突然断裂了，山姆和佛罗多踉跄地冲出去；然后，他们拔腿飞奔，想要尽快躲开那死气沉沉的大门和雕像恐怖的视线。接着，身后传来破裂的声音，拱门的地基差点就砸中他们，整面墙垮了下来，化成一堆废墟。他们在千钧一发之间逃了出来，警钟响起，监视者发出刺耳的尖叫，黑暗的高空传来了回应，从墨黑的天空中冲出一只长着翅膀的怪兽，凄厉的嚎叫撕裂了乌云。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Aiya elenion ancalima!" cried Frodo once again behind him.</div>
