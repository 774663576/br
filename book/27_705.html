<div class="line_en">A close read revealed other significant shortcomings. For one thing, the paper included data for only a few blood tests. And results for two of those tests, HDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol, diverged from the FDA-approved machines by a margin that Theranos itself acknowledged "exceeds recommended limits." The company also conceded that it had run the assays one at a time, belying Holmes's previous claim that her technology could do dozens of tests simultaneously on one tiny blood sample. Last but not least, the tests performed had required different configurations of the miniLab because Theranos hadn't yet figured out how to fit all the components into one box. All of this was a far cry from the revolutionary breakthrough Holmes had touted when Theranos launched its tests in Walgreens stores in the fall of 2013.</div>

<div class="line_en">The paper described the device's components and inner workings and included some data purporting to show that it held its own when compared with FDA-approved machines. But there was one major catch: the blood Theranos had used in its study was drawn the old-fashioned way, with a needle in the arm. Holmes's original premise -- fast and accurate test results from just a drop or two pricked from a finger -- was nowhere to be found in the paper.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="论文描述迷你实验室的内部组成与运作方式，并且收录了部分数据，意图证明这个设备并不比FDA核准的机器逊色。不过其中有个很大的蹊跷：Theranos在研究中所使用的血液是用传统方法抽取，也就是用针头在手臂抽血，霍姆斯最初的前提——只用扎手指取得的一、二滴血，即可得出快速又准确的检验结果——在论文里完全不见踪影。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the days after my first Journal article, Holmes defiantly asserted that she would publish clinical data from her blood-testing system to disprove my reporting. "Data is a powerful thing because it speaks for itself," she said on October 26, 2015, at a conference hosted by the Cleveland Clinic. Two years and three months later, she finally delivered on that pledge: in January 2018, Theranos published a paper about the miniLab in the peer-reviewed scientific journal Bioengineering and Translational Medicine.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第一篇报导刚刊出那段日子，霍姆斯顽抗宣称她会发表临床数据来证明我报导不实，「数据是很有力量的东西，因为数据会说话。」她二〇一五年十月二十六日在克里夫兰医学中心的会议上这么说。两年又三个月后，她终于实践诺言：二〇一八年一月，Theranos在同侪审查科学期刊《生物工程学与转译医学》（Bioengineering and Translational Medicine），发表一篇有关迷你实验室的论文。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Holmes's name was listed among the paper's coauthors but Balwani's was not. After their breakup and his departure from the company in the spring of 2016, Balwani seemed to have dropped off the face of the earth. Holmes had moved out of the 6,555-square-foot house he owned in Atherton (acquired for $9 million in 2013 through a limited liability company), and it wasn't clear if he continued to live there. For a time, there was speculation among former Theranos employees that he had fled the country to elude federal investigators.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="霍姆斯的名字列在那篇论文的共同作者之下，但是没有包汪尼。二〇一六年春天跟霍姆斯分手、离开Theranos之后，包汪尼似乎就人间蒸发。霍姆斯已搬出他在阿瑟顿的六千五百五十五平方英尺豪宅（二〇一三年透过一家责任有限公司以九百万美元购入），他是否仍住在那里不得而知，Theranos前员工一度盛传他为了躲避联邦调查人员，已逃离美国。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Those rumors were put to rest on the morning of March 6, 2017, when Tyler Shultz entered a conference room at the offices of Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher on Mission Street in San Francisco. Standing among the half dozen lawyers present to take his deposition in the Partner Fund litigation was the familiar diminutive figure with the angry scowl who had terrorized Theranos employees. Balwani was a named defendant in the lawsuit, so his presence was unusual and seemed to have but one purpose: to intimidate the witness. If that was indeed the goal, it didn't work. Over the next eight and a half hours, Tyler focused on giving truthful answers to the questions he was asked and blocked out the silent presence of his irascible former boss at the other end of the conference table. Seven weeks later, Theranos settled the case for $43 million on the eve of Balwani's own deposition. (Soon after, it settled the Walgreens lawsuit for more than $25 million.)</div>

<div class="line_en">By late 2017, Theranos was running on fumes, having burned through most of the $900 million it raised from investors, much of it on legal expenses. Several rounds of layoffs had reduced the size of its workforce to fewer than 130 employees from a high of 800 in 2015. To save on rent, the company had moved all its remaining staff to the Newark facility across San Francisco Bay. The specter of a bankruptcy filing loomed. But a few days before Christmas, Holmes announced that she had secured a $100 million loan from a private-equity firm. The financial lifeline came with strict conditions: the loan was collateralized by Theranos's patent portfolio and the company would have to meet certain product and operational milestones to get the money.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到了二〇一七年底，Theranos的油箱已经见底，向投资人募来的九亿美元已经烧得差不多，其中大多用于诉讼费用。几轮裁员下来，员工人数已经从二〇一五年全盛时期的八百人，剩下不到一百三十人，为了节省租金，员工全数搬到旧金山湾对岸的纽华克厂区。宣布破产的幽灵一步步逼近，不过就在耶诞节前几天，霍姆斯宣布向私募基金取得一亿美元的借贷。这条金钱救命绳有严苛的条件：Theranos必须以手上的专利做为借贷担保品，还有Theranos必须在产品和营运上达成某个里程碑，才能取得这笔钱。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Less than three months later, the walls began closing in again: on March 14, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Theranos, Holmes, and Balwani with conducting "an elaborate, years-long fraud." To resolve the agency's civil charges, Holmes was forced to relinquish her voting control over the company, give back a big chunk of her stock, and pay a $500,000 penalty. She also agreed to be barred from being an officer or director in a public company for ten years. Unable to reach a settlement with Balwani, the SEC sued him in federal court in California. In the meantime, the criminal investigation continued to gather steam. As of this writing, criminal indictments of both Holmes and Balwani on charges of lying to investors and federal officials seem a distinct possibility.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不到三个月后，高墙再度一步步进逼：二〇一八年三月十四日，美国证券交易委员会指控Theranos、霍姆斯、包汪尼进行「精心设计、长年的诈欺」。为了解决证交会的民事指控，霍姆斯不得不交出公司的表决控制权（voting control）、退还大部分持股，并且上缴五十万美元罚款，她也同意未来十年不担任上市公司的董事或管理职。至于包汪尼，由于没有达成和解，证交会将他告上加州的联邦法院。另一方面，刑事犯罪调查仍如火如荼进行中，到本书付梓之前，霍姆斯和包汪尼遭到刑事起诉的可能性看来很明确，罪名是欺骗投资人和联邦官员。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">By positioning Theranos as a tech company in the heart of the Valley, Holmes channeled this fake-it-until-you-make-it culture, and she went to extreme lengths to hide the fakery. Many companies in Silicon Valley make their employees sign nondisclosure agreements, but at Theranos the obsession with secrecy reached a whole different level. Employees were prohibited from putting "Theranos" on their LinkedIn profiles. Instead, they were told to write that they worked for a "private biotechnology company." Some former employees received cease-and-desist letters from Theranos lawyers for posting descriptions of their jobs at the company that were deemed too detailed. Balwani routinely monitored employees' emails and internet browser history. He also prohibited the use of Google Chrome on the theory that Google could use the web browser to spy on Theranos's R&amp;D. Employees who worked at the office complex in Newark were discouraged from using the gym there because it might lead them to mingle with workers from other companies that leased space at the site.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="霍姆斯把Theranos定位为硅谷中心的科技公司，注入硅谷这套「演久就成真」（fake it until you make it）的文化，并且把掩饰假象这件事做到极致。硅谷很多公司都要求员工签署保密协议，只是Theranos对保密的执念达到了全新的境界。它禁止员工在领英网站的个人数据栏填入「Theranos」，必须填入在「未上市生技公司」上班；有些前员工因为叙述Theranos工作内容「太过详细」，而收到Theranos律师寄来的禁止令；包汪尼会固定监视员工的电邮和网络浏览历史，甚至禁止使用Google Chrome浏览器，理由是谷歌可以用这个浏览器窥探Theranos的研发；在纽华克综合办公大楼工作的员工，不可以使用大楼的健身房，因为可能会跟大楼其他公司员工有所往来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The term "Vaporware" was coined in the early 1980s to describe new computer software or hardware that was announced with great fanfare only to take years to materialize, if it did at all. It was a reflection of the computer industry's tendency to play it fast and loose when it came to marketing. Microsoft, Apple, and Oracle were all accused of engaging in the practice at one point or another. Such overpromising became a defining feature of Silicon Valley. The harm done to consumers was minor, measured in frustration and deflated expectations.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="「雾件」（vaporware）这个字是一九八〇年代所发明，形容一开始大肆吹捧，但最后耗费数年才成真的新软件或新硬件（还不见得能成真），反映出电脑界在行销上轻忽不负责任的倾向，微软、苹果、甲骨文都曾被指控用过这种手法，这种过度承诺文化于是成为硅谷的特征之一，只是对消费者的危害很小，顶多就是失望和期待落空。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Hyping your product to get funding while concealing your true progress and hoping that reality will eventually catch up to the hype continues to be tolerated in the tech industry. But it's crucial to bear in mind that Theranos wasn't a tech company in the traditional sense. It was first and foremost a health-care company. Its product wasn't software but a medical device that analyzed people's blood. As Holmes herself liked to point out in media interviews and public appearances at the height of her fame, doctors base 70 percent of their treatment decisions on lab results. They rely on lab equipment to work as advertised. Otherwise, patient health is jeopardized.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对外吹嘘自己的技术以取得资金，另一方面却隐瞒真正的进展、期待现况有一天会真的赶上吹嘘，这一套做法持续在科技产业受到容忍，不过别忘了，Theranos并不是传统定义的科技公司，医疗公司才是它最重要的身分。它的产品不是软件，而是分析民众血液的医疗设备，如同霍姆斯在名声鼎盛时接受媒体访问和公开亮相一再指出的：医生有七成的治疗决策是根据实验室检验结果，所以实验室器材的成效必须如同广告宣传，否则病人的健康就会受到危害。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the part of the clinical lab dubbed "Normandy," partitions were erected around the Edisons so that Siemens technicians wouldn't be able to see them when they came to service the German manufacturer's machines. The partitions turned the room into a maze and blocked egress. The lab's windows were tinted, which made it nearly impossible to see in from the outside, but the company still taped sheets of opaque plastic to the inside. The doors to the corridor that led to the lab rooms, and the lab rooms themselves, were equipped with fingerprint scanners. If more than one person entered at a time, sensors set off an alarm and activated a camera that sent a photo to the security desk. As for surveillance cameras, they were everywhere. They were the kind with dark blue dome covers that kept you guessing about which way the lens was directed. All of this was ostensibly to protect trade secrets, but it's now clear that it was also a way for Holmes to cover up her lies about the state of Theranos's technology.</div>

<div class="line_en">So how was Holmes able to rationalize gambling with people's lives? One school of thought is that she became captive to Balwani's nefarious influence. Under this theory, Balwani was Holmes's Svengali and molded her -- the innocent ingénue with big dreams -- into the precocious young female startup founder that the Valley craved and that he was too old, too male, and too Indian to play himself. There's no question that Balwani was a bad influence. But to place all the blame on his shoulders is not only too convenient, it's inaccurate. Employees who saw the two interact up close describe a partnership in which Holmes, even if she was almost twenty years younger, had the last say. Moreover, Balwani didn't join Theranos until late 2009. By then, Holmes had already been misleading pharmaceutical companies for years about the readiness of her technology. And with actions that ranged from blackmailing her chief financial officer to suing ex-employees, she had displayed a pattern of ruthlessness at odds with the portrait of a well-intentioned young woman manipulated by an older man.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所以，霍姆斯怎么能合理化她拿人命当赌注的事实呢？有一派说法是：她受制于包汪尼邪恶的影响。根据这派理论，包汪尼是霍姆斯的斯文加利（Svengali，译按：小说《特丽尔比》［Trilby］里的男性角色，他引诱、控制、利用特丽尔比这个年轻的爱尔兰女孩，并把她塑造成知名歌手），一手将她这个胸怀大梦、天真单纯的女孩，塑造成硅谷渴盼的早熟年轻女创业家，他自己则因为太老、太男性、太印度，不能出来扮演自己。包汪尼确实是不好的影响，这点无庸置疑，不过把责任全怪到他头上不仅太过简化，也不精确。近距离看过他们两人交互的员工，都形容他们是伙伴关系，霍姆斯虽然比包汪尼年轻近二十岁，却是最后拍板定案的人。更何况，包汪尼一直到二〇〇九年底才加入Theranos，当时，霍姆斯早已误导制药公司多年，谎称其技术已准备就绪。再说，胁迫自己的财务长、控告前员工等行径完全可看出她的无情冷酷，这样的行为模式，不像是个出发点良善但遭到老男人操控的年轻女子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Holmes knew exactly what she was doing and she was firmly in control. When one former employee interviewed for a job at Theranos in the summer of 2011, he asked Holmes about the role of the company's board. She took offense at the question. "The board is just a placeholder," he recalls her saying. "I make all the decisions here." Her annoyance was so palpable that he thought he'd blown the interview. Two years later, Holmes made sure that the board would never be more than a placeholder.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="霍姆斯很清楚自己在做什么，而且她是那个掌控的人。某位前员工二〇一一年夏天前往Theranos面试时，向霍姆斯问到公司董事会扮演的角色，她对这个问题很不高兴。「董事会只是酬庸，」他记得她这么说：「这里一切由我做决定。」她脸上的不悦实在太明显，使得他以为自己搞砸面试了。两年后，霍姆斯确立了董事会永远只会是酬庸的角色。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In December 2013, she forced through a resolution that assigned one hundred votes to every share she owned, giving her 99.7 percent of the voting rights. From that point on, the Theranos board couldn't even reach a quorum without Holmes. When he was later questioned about board deliberations in a deposition, George Shultz said, "We never took any votes at Theranos. It was pointless. Elizabeth was going to decide whatever she decided." This helps explain why the board never hired a law firm to conduct an independent investigation of what happened. At a publicly traded company, such an investigation would have been commissioned within days or weeks of the first media revelations. But at Theranos, nothing could be decided or done without Holmes's assent.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="二〇一三年十二月，她强行通过一项决议，让她手中每一股股票有一百票表决权，她等于握有九九‧七％的表决权，从此，只要少了霍姆斯，董事会连达到法定开会人数的门槛都不到。乔治．舒兹后来出庭作证被问到董事会审议情形，他说：「我们在Theranos从来不投票表决，那没有意义，不管要决定什么，都是由伊莉莎白做决定。」这就是为什么董事会从来没有聘请律师调查这一切发生的事。若是股票公开交易的公司，媒体曝光第一篇文章后，董事会不到几天或几个星期就会委托进行这类调查了，可是在Theranos，没有霍姆斯的同意，什么事都决定不了、也什么事都做不了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">If anything, it was Holmes who was the manipulator. One after another, she wrapped people around her finger and persuaded them to do her bidding. The first to fall under her spell was Channing Robertson, the Stanford engineering professor whose reputation helped give her credibility when she was just a teenager. Then there was Donald L. Lucas, the aging venture capitalist whose backing and connections enabled her to keep raising money. Dr. J and Wade Miquelon at Walgreens and Safeway CEO Steve Burd were next, followed by James Mattis, George Shultz, and Henry Kissinger (Mattis's entanglement with Theranos proved no obstacle to his being confirmed as President Donald Trump's secretary of defense). David Boies and Rupert Murdoch complete the list, though I've left out many others who were bewitched by Holmes's mixture of charm, intelligence, and charisma.</div>
