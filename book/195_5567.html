<div class="line_en">For the next three months Philip worked on subjects which were new to him. The unwieldy crowd which had entered the Medical School nearly two years before had thinned out: some had left the hospital, finding the examinations more difficult to pass than they expected, some had been taken away by parents who had not foreseen the expense of life in London, and some had drifted away to other callings. One youth whom Philip knew had devised an ingenious plan to make money; he had bought things at sales and pawned them, but presently found it more profitable to pawn goods bought on credit; and it had caused a little excitement at the hospital when someone pointed out his name in police-court proceedings. There had been a remand, then assurances on the part of a harassed father, and the young man had gone out to bear the White Man's Burden overseas. The imagination of another, a lad who had never before been in a town at all, fell to the glamour of music-halls and bar parlours; he spent his time among racing-men, tipsters, and trainers, and now was become a book-maker's clerk. Philip had seen him once in a bar near Piccadilly Circus in a tight-waisted coat and a brown hat with a broad, flat brim. A third, with a gift for singing and mimicry, who had achieved success at the smoking concerts of the Medical School by his imitation of notorious comedians, had abandoned the hospital for the chorus of a musical comedy. Still another, and he interested Philip because his uncouth manner and interjectional speech did not suggest that he was capable of any deep emotion, had felt himself stifle among the houses of London. He grew haggard in shut-in spaces, and the soul he knew not he possessed struggled like a sparrow held in the hand, with little frightened gasps and a quick palpitation of the heart: he yearned for the broad skies and the open, desolate places among which his childhood had been spent; and he walked off one day, without a word to anybody, between one lecture and another; and the next thing his friends heard was that he had thrown up medicine and was working on a farm.</div>

<div class="line_en">Philip attended now lectures on medicine and on surgery. On certain mornings in the week he practised bandaging on out-patients glad to earn a little money, and he was taught auscultation and how to use the stethoscope. He learned dispensing. He was taking the examination in Materia Medica in July, and it amused him to play with various drugs, concocting mixtures, rolling pills, and making ointments. He seized avidly upon anything from which he could extract a suggestion of human interest.</div>

<div class="line_en">He saw Griffiths once in the distance, but, not to have the pain of cutting him dead, avoided him. Philip had felt a certain self-consciousness with Griffiths' friends, some of whom were now friends of his, when he realised they knew of his quarrel with Griffiths and surmised they were aware of the reason. One of them, a very tall fellow, with a small head and a languid air, a youth called Ramsden, who was one of Griffiths' most faithful admirers, copied his ties, his boots, his manner of talking and his gestures, told Philip that Griffiths was very much hurt because Philip had not answered his letter. He wanted to be reconciled with him.</div>

<div class="line_en">Little by little he discovered the history of Mildred's relations with Griffiths. He listened with a smile on his lips, feigning an equanimity which quite deceived the dull-witted boy who talked to him. The week-end she spent with Griffiths at Oxford inflamed rather than extinguished her sudden passion; and when Griffiths went home, with a feeling that was unexpected in her she determined to stay in Oxford by herself for a couple of days, because she had been so happy in it. She felt that nothing could induce her to go back to Philip. He revolted her. Griffiths was taken aback at the fire he had aroused, for he had found his two days with her in the country somewhat tedious; and he had no desire to turn an amusing episode into a tiresome affair. She made him promise to write to her, and, being an honest, decent fellow, with natural politeness and a desire to make himself pleasant to everybody, when he got home he wrote her a long and charming letter. She answered it with reams of passion, clumsy, for she had no gift of expression, ill-written, and vulgar; the letter bored him, and when it was followed next day by another, and the day after by a third, he began to think her love no longer flattering but alarming. He did not answer; and she bombarded him with telegrams, asking him if he were ill and had received her letters; she said his silence made her dreadfully anxious. He was forced to write, but he sought to make his reply as casual as was possible without being offensive: he begged her not to wire, since it was difficult to explain telegrams to his mother, an old-fashioned person for whom a telegram was still an event to excite tremor. She answered by return of post that she must see him and announced her intention to pawn things (she had the dressing-case which Philip had given her as a wedding-present and could raise eight pounds on that) in order to come up and stay at the market town four miles from which was the village in which his father practised. This frightened Griffiths; and he, this time, made use of the telegraph wires to tell her that she must do nothing of the kind. He promised to let her know the moment he came up to London, and, when he did, found that she had already been asking for him at the hospital at which he had an appointment. He did not like this, and, on seeing her, told Mildred that she was not to come there on any pretext; and now, after an absence of three weeks, he found that she bored him quite decidedly; he wondered why he had ever troubled about her, and made up his mind to break with her as soon as he could. He was a person who dreaded quarrels, nor did he want to give pain; but at the same time he had other things to do, and he was quite determined not to let Mildred bother him. When he met her he was pleasant, cheerful, amusing, affectionate; he invented convincing excuses for the interval since last he had seen her; but he did everything he could to avoid her. When she forced him to make appointments he sent telegrams to her at the last moment to put himself off; and his landlady (the first three months of his appointment he was spending in rooms) had orders to say he was out when Mildred called. She would waylay him in the street and, knowing she had been waiting about for him to come out of the hospital for a couple of hours, he would give her a few charming, friendly words and bolt off with the excuse that he had a business engagement. He grew very skilful in slipping out of the hospital unseen. Once, when he went back to his lodgings at midnight, he saw a woman standing at the area railings and suspecting who it was went to beg a shake-down in Ramsden's rooms; next day the landlady told him that Mildred had sat crying on the doorsteps for hours, and she had been obliged to tell her at last that if she did not go away she would send for a policeman.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="拉姆斯登把整件事娓娓道来，菲利普慢慢了解了米尔德里德和格里菲斯恋情的来龙去脉。他嘴角挂着笑，镇静自若的样子让面前那个迟钝的小伙子真以为他一点都不在乎呢。原来，在牛津和格里菲斯相处了一个周末后，米尔德里德的欲火一点也没消下去，反而愈烧愈烈了。等到格里菲斯准备回家的时候，她突发奇想说要在牛津多留几天，因为在这儿的日子过得太开心了。没有什么能引诱她乖乖回到菲利普身边。他让她反胃。格里菲斯做梦也没想到自己把她勾出了这么大的火儿。和她待在乡下的这两天着实无聊透了，他只当这是段风流韵事，可不愿意和她纠缠个没完没了。她逼着他发誓一定会写信寄来，而他是个言而有信的正派人，做事追求礼节周全，还一心想让所有人都喜欢自己，所以刚到家就给她写了封情真意切的长信。她的回信笔迹凌乱，激情四溢，鉴于她本就没有多少文字天赋，整封信写得颠三倒四，俗不可耐，让格里菲斯大倒胃口。第二天，紧接着又收到了一封，过了一天又来了第三封。他开始觉得她的爱情不是蜜糖，而胜似砒霜。他没有回信，她就用电报一封封地轮番轰炸，问他是不是生病了，是否收到她的信；说总是听不到他的消息，害得她担心死了。格里菲斯没别的办法，只能写信过去，绞尽脑汁把话说得随意而不唐突：求她别再发电报纠缠了，他实在很难跟母亲解释为什么会收到这么多电报。他母亲还是个老古董，一看有电报发来就吓得浑身哆嗦，生怕出了什么大事。她又转而写信，说非见到他不可，还要去典当些东西（菲利普送给她的那个化妆包还能卖个八镑），跑到离格里菲斯父亲行医的村庄四英里远的地方住下来。这个主意可吓坏了格里菲斯，他赶紧发回电报告诉她这么做万万不可。他说等自己一回伦敦就联系她，可真等回来了，却发现她已经去他准备就职的医院找过他了。他不喜欢被人逼得这么紧，再见到她的时候，便直截了当地说不论发生什么情况都不允许她再找去医院了。一别三周，再见到她的时候反而觉得她更烦人。他想不通自己怎么会看上她，下定决定要趁早做个了结。他是那种不喜欢吵架的人，也不希望给别人带来痛苦，可这时他还有要事在身，更不想让她缠着自己。再碰面时，他满面春风，笑容可掬，解释了半天为什么最近一直没来见她，态度诚恳，令人不得不信服。可同时，他又想尽各种手段躲着不见她。每次她逼着要见面，他都在最后一刻发来电报说自己脱不开身。她上门来找他，房东太太（他工作的前三个月还住在公寓里）也受命骗她说他不在。后来她又换了策略，开始在路上堵他，好几次听她抱怨说已经在医院门口等了好几个钟头了，他就来几句甜言蜜语，然后推说自己还有工作，溜之大吉。他已经学会了一手从医院悄悄溜走的技巧。有次，三更半夜刚到家门口，看见栅栏那里站了个女人——不用猜都知道那是谁——于是又悄悄摸到拉姆斯登那里借宿了一宿。第二天，房东告诉他米尔德里德坐在门前台阶上哭了好久，最后不得不吓唬她，说要是再不走就要喊警察来了。">查看中文翻译</div>
