<div class="line_en">After some opposition, Marianne yielded to her sister's entreaties, andconsented to go out with her and Mrs. Jennings one morning for half anhour. She expressly conditioned, however, for paying no visits, andwould do no more than accompany them to Gray's in Sackville Street, where Elinor was carrying on a negotiation for the exchange of a fewold-fashioned jewels of her mother.</div>

<div class="line_en">When they stopped at the door, Mrs. Jennings recollected that there wasa lady at the other end of the street on whom she ought to call; and asshe had no business at Gray's, it was resolved, that while her youngfriends transacted their's, she should pay her visit and return forthem.</div>

<div class="line_en">On ascending the stairs, the Miss Dashwoods found so many people beforethem in the room, that there was not a person at liberty to tend totheir orders; and they were obliged to wait. All that could be donewas, to sit down at that end of the counter which seemed to promise thequickest succession; one gentleman only was standing there, and it isprobable that Elinor was not without hope of exciting his politeness toa quicker despatch. But the correctness of his eye, and the delicacyof his taste, proved to be beyond his politeness. He was giving ordersfor a toothpick-case for himself, and till its size, shape, andornaments were determined, all of which, after examining and debatingfor a quarter of an hour over every toothpick-case in the shop, werefinally arranged by his own inventive fancy, he had no leisure tobestow any other attention on the two ladies, than what was comprisedin three or four very broad stares; a kind of notice which served toimprint on Elinor the remembrance of a person and face, of strong, natural, sterling insignificance, though adorned in the first style offashion.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两位达什伍德小姐上楼梯时，只见有不少人早来了，店里没人顾得上应酬她们，于是只好等候。最好的办法是坐到柜台一端，看来这样可能轮起来最快。这里只站着一位先生，埃丽诺大有希望让他讲点礼貌，办事利索点。谁知这人特别挑剔，也很有眼力，顾不上讲究礼貌。他要订购一只牙签盒，为了确定大小、式样和图案，他把店里的所有牙签盒都拿来端详、盘算，每只都要磨蹭半个钟头，最后凭着他那神奇的想象力终于定了下来。在此期间，他无暇顾及两位小姐，只是粗略地瞟了她们三四眼。不过他这一回顾，倒使他那副外貌和嘴脸深深铭刻在埃丽诺的脑海里：他纵使打扮得时鬓绝顶，也只不过是个愚昧、好强、不折不扣的卑微小人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At last the affair was decided. The ivory, the gold, and the pearls, all received their appointment, and the gentleman having named the lastday on which his existence could be continued without the possession ofthe toothpick-case, drew on his gloves with leisurely care, andbestowing another glance on the Miss Dashwoods, but such a one asseemed rather to demand than express admiration, walked off with ahappy air of real conceit and affected indifference.</div>

<div class="line_en">His visit was duly paid. He came with a pretence at an apology fromtheir sister-in-law, for not coming too; "but she was so much engagedwith her mother, that really she had no leisure for going any where."Mrs. Jennings, however, assured him directly, that she should not standupon ceremony, for they were all cousins, or something like it, and sheshould certainly wait on Mrs. John Dashwood very soon, and bring hersisters to see her. His manners to THEM, though calm, were perfectlykind; to Mrs. Jennings, most attentively civil; and on ColonelBrandon's coming in soon after himself, he eyed him with a curiositywhich seemed to say, that he only wanted to know him to be rich, to beequally civil to HIM.</div>

Perhaps just at present he may beundecided; the smallness of your fortune may make him hang back; hisfriends may all advise him against it. But some of those littleattentions and encouragements which ladies can so easily give will fixhim, in spite of himself. And there can be no reason why you shouldnot try for him. It is not to be supposed that any prior attachment onyour side-in short, you know as to an attachment of that kind, it isquite out of the question, the objections are insurmountable-you havetoo much sense not to see all that. Colonel Brandon must be the man; and no civility shall be wanting on my part to make him pleased withyou and your family. It is a match that must give universalsatisfaction. In short, it is a kind of thing that" -- lowering hisvoice to an important whisper --"will be exceedingly welcome to ALLPARTIES." Recollecting himself, however, he added, "That is, I mean tosay-your friends are all truly anxious to see you well settled; Fannyparticularly, for she has your interest very much at heart, I assureyou.

A thousand a-year is a great deal for a mother to give away, tomake over for ever; but Mrs. Ferrars has a noble spirit. To give youanother instance of her liberality: -- The other day, as soon as we cameto town, aware that money could not be very plenty with us just now, she put bank-notes into Fanny's hands to the amount of two hundredpounds.

<div class="line_en">"Her daughters are both exceedingly well married, and therefore Icannot perceive the necessity of her remembering them farther. Whereas, in my opinion, by her taking so much notice of you, andtreating you in this kind of way, she has given you a sort of claim onher future consideration, which a conscientious woman would notdisregard. Nothing can be kinder than her behaviour; and she canhardly do all this, without being aware of the expectation it raises."</div>

<div class="line_en">"I am sorry for that. At her time of life, any thing of an illnessdestroys the bloom for ever! Hers has been a very short one! She wasas handsome a girl last September, as I ever saw; and as likely toattract the man. There was something in her style of beauty, to pleasethem particularly. I remember Fanny used to say that she would marrysooner and better than you did; not but what she is exceedingly fond ofYOU, but so it happened to strike her. She will be mistaken, however. I question whether Marianne NOW, will marry a man worth more than fiveor six hundred a-year, at the utmost, and I am very much deceived ifYOU do not do better. Dorsetshire! I know very little of Dorsetshire; but, my dear Elinor, I shall be exceedingly glad to know more of it; and I think I can answer for your having Fanny and myself among theearliest and best pleased of your visitors."</div>

<div class="line_en">They were lucky enough to find Lady Middleton at home, and Sir Johncame in before their visit ended. Abundance of civilities passed onall sides. Sir John was ready to like anybody, and though Mr. Dashwooddid not seem to know much about horses, he soon set him down as a verygood-natured fellow: while Lady Middleton saw enough of fashion in hisappearance to think his acquaintance worth having; and Mr. Dashwoodwent away delighted with both.</div>

<div class="line_en">Elinor tried very seriously to convince him that there was nolikelihood of her marrying Colonel Brandon; but it was an expectationof too much pleasure to himself to be relinquished, and he was reallyresolved on seeking an intimacy with that gentleman, and promoting themarriage by every possible attention. He had just compunction enoughfor having done nothing for his sisters himself, to be exceedinglyanxious that everybody else should do a great deal; and an offer fromColonel Brandon, or a legacy from Mrs. Jennings, was the easiest meansof atoning for his own neglect.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃丽诺非常严肃地对他说，她不可能嫁给布兰登上校。然而，他一心期待这门亲事能给他带来无比巨大的喜悦，因而不肯善罢甘休。他打定主意，千方百计地密切同那位先生的关系，尽心竭力地促成这门婚事。他对妹妹一向没有尽过力，感到有点歉疚，因此便渴望别人能多出点力。让布兰登上校向她求婚，或者让詹宁斯太太给她留下一笔遗产，将是他弥补自己过失的最简便的途径。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I shall have a charming account to carry to Fanny," said he, as hewalked back with his sister. "Lady Middleton is really a most elegantwoman! Such a woman as I am sure Fanny will be glad to know. And Mrs. Jennings too, an exceedingly well-behaved woman, though not so elegantas her daughter. Your sister need not have any scruple even ofvisiting HER, which, to say the truth, has been a little the case, andvery naturally; for we only knew that Mrs. Jennings was the widow of aman who had got all his money in a low way; and Fanny and Mrs. Ferrarswere both strongly prepossessed, that neither she nor her daughterswere such kind of women as Fanny would like to associate with. But nowI can carry her a most satisfactory account of both."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我要向范妮报告一下这次美好的会见，”他和妹妹一边往回走，一边说道。“米德尔顿夫人确实是个极其娴雅的女人！我知道范妮就喜欢结识这样的女人。还有詹宁斯太太，她是个极懂规矩的女人，虽然不像她女儿那样娴雅。你嫂嫂甚至可以毫无顾忌地来拜访她。说老实话，她原来有点顾忌，这是很自然的。因为我们先前只知道詹宁斯太太是个寡妇，她丈夫靠卑劣的手段发了财，于是范妮和费拉斯太太便抱有强烈的偏见，认为她和她女儿都不是范妮应该与之交往的那种女人。现在，我要回去向她好好地美言一番。”">查看中文翻译</div>
