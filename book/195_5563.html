<div class="line_en">Next day, in the afternoon, Philip sat in his room and wondered whether Mildred would come. He had slept badly. He had spent the morning in the club of the Medical School, reading one newspaper after another. It was the vacation and few students he knew were in London, but he found one or two people to talk to, he played a game of chess, and so wore out the tedious hours. After luncheon he felt so tired, his head was aching so, that he went back to his lodgings and lay down; he tried to read a novel. He had not seen Griffiths. He was not in when Philip returned the night before; he heard him come back, but he did not as usual look into Philip's room to see if he was asleep; and in the morning Philip heard him go out early. It was clear that he wanted to avoid him. Suddenly there was a light tap at his door. Philip sprang to his feet and opened it. Mildred stood on the threshold. She did not move.</div>

He'd pawn anything he could, but he's pawned everything already.

Without realising what he did, he went up to her and put his arms round her; she did not resist, but in her wretchedness surrendered herself to his comforting. He whispered to her little words of solace. He scarcely knew what he was saying, he bent over her and kissed her repeatedly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="米尔德里德哭得很凶，单薄的身子颤抖不停。菲利普从没见过一个女人哭得这般忘情、这般歇斯底里。他心疼她，心疼得好像要把自己的身体撕裂开来。他不由自主地站起来，走到她身旁，抱着她。米尔德里德没有拒绝，此刻的悲恸入骨让她屈服于他给的慰藉。他俯在耳边轻轻安慰了几句，自己都听不清自己在说些什么，只是弯下腰去一而再，再而三地亲吻着她。">查看中文翻译</div>

Something seemed to give way in his heart; it really felt to him as though something were breaking, and he felt strangely weak.</div>

<div class="line_en">She sent him a note a couple of hours later to say that she had a headache and could not dine with him. Philip had almost expected it. He knew that she was dining with Griffiths. He was horribly jealous, but the sudden passion which had seized the pair of them seemed like something that had come from the outside, as though a god had visited them with it, and he felt himself helpless. It seemed so natural that they should love one another. He saw all the advantages that Griffiths had over himself and confessed that in Mildred's place he would have done as Mildred did. What hurt him most was Griffiths' treachery; they had been such good friends, and Griffiths knew how passionately devoted he was to Mildred: he might have spared him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="几个钟头以后，她托人送来张便条，说自己头疼，没法陪他吃晚饭。菲利普几乎事先就猜到她会这么做，知道她一定在陪格里菲斯。他心里妒火中烧，这两人之间腾起的情欲像是从天边飞来，似乎冥冥之中有神灵相撮合，他无可奈何。他们爱上彼此再自然不过。他看到所有格里菲斯长于他的优点，也承认如果自己是米尔德里德，同样会选择和格里菲斯在一起。真正使他受到伤害的，其实是格里菲斯的背叛。他们是那么要好的朋友，他知道自己对米尔德里德的一往情深：他本该把她让给他才对。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He did not see Mildred again till Friday; he was sick for a sight of her by then; but when she came and he realised that he had gone out of her thoughts entirely, for they were engrossed in Griffiths, he suddenly hated her. He saw now why she and Griffiths loved one another, Griffiths was stupid, oh so stupid! he had known that all along, but had shut his eyes to it, stupid and empty-headed: that charm of his concealed an utter selfishness; he was willing to sacrifice anyone to his appetites. And how inane was the life he led, lounging about bars and drinking in music halls, wandering from one light amour to another! He never read a book, he was blind to everything that was not frivolous and vulgar; he had never a thought that was fine: the word most common on his lips was smart; that was his highest praise for man or woman. Smart! It was no wonder he pleased Mildred. They suited one another.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="直到礼拜五，他才又见到米尔德里德；这段时间里，他有多想见她一面，可当她真的出现在眼前，才明白过来，她的心里一点儿也没想着他。她被格里菲斯迷得魂不守舍，而他竟突然对她生了恨意。现在才知道为什么这两个人能互相看对眼，格里菲斯真是个傻子，傻透了！其实他一直都晓得这点，只不过对此视而不见罢了。他愚蠢透顶，头脑空空，只凭自己的几分魅力隐藏了性格中彻彻底底的自私：为了满足自己的欲望，谁都可以不管不顾。他的生活过得空虚无趣，日日流连于酒馆剧院、觥筹交错之间，身边的女人像走马灯一样换来换去。他从不读书，只关注些轻浮恶俗的东西，向来没有一点高尚的思想：最常挂在嘴边的词儿就是“机灵”，这就是他对一个人的最高评价了，别管是男是女，一律都“机灵”！怪不得他喜欢米尔德里德呢。两个人真是气味相投啊。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Philip talked to Mildred of things that mattered to neither of them. He knew she wanted to speak of Griffiths, but he gave her no opportunity. He did not refer to the fact that two evenings before she had put off dining with him on a trivial excuse. He was casual with her, trying to make her think he was suddenly grown indifferent; and he exercised peculiar skill in saying little things which he knew would wound her; but which were so indefinite, so delicately cruel, that she could not take exception to them. At last she got up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="菲利普和她扯着闲天，说些对两个人都无关紧要的事。他知道她一心想谈谈格里菲斯，可一点机会也不给她。两天前，她随便找了个借口就推掉了和自己的晚餐，可对这件事菲利普一直闭口不谈。他心不在焉地聊着天，想让她觉得自己变得越来越冷漠。他用一种特殊的技巧对付她，漫无边际地胡侃些微不足道的小事，还句句话里藏针，专门用来折磨她。这些话含糊不清，伤人于无形之中，但她又不好翻脸走人。最后，她站起来说：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She held out her hand, he took it, said good-bye, and opened the door for her. He knew what she wanted to speak about, and he knew also that his cold, ironical air intimidated her. Often his shyness made him seem so frigid that unintentionally he frightened people, and, having discovered this, he was able when occasion arose to assume the same manner.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她伸出手来和他握了握，道声再会。他替她打开门，心里明白她心里还窝着些话没有说出口。他知道自己冷冰冰、硬邦邦的态度让她有点胆怯了。通常他只要一害羞就会板着脸，看上去非常冷淡，总是能无意之中把人吓上一跳。发现了这件事后，每次一有需要，他都会刻意摆出一脸严肃的样子来吓唬人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I daresay you've got a lot to do," he answered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我敢说你肯定还有很多事要做呢。”菲利普说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You haven't forgotten what you promised?" she said at last, as he held open the door.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Why not?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“为什么不去了？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He spoke with an icy deliberation which made his words peculiarly offensive. Mildred flushed. He knew she hated him at that moment, and he wondered at the self-control by which she prevented herself from flying out at him. He wanted to make her suffer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的语气慎重而冷漠，听来特别挑衅。米尔德里德羞红了脸。他知道此刻她一定恨死他了，该是忍得多苦才能不朝他破口大骂。他就想看着她受点苦。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A devil seized Philip, a devil of self-torture which was always lurking within him, and, though with all his soul he wished that Griffiths and Mildred should not go away together, he could not help himself; he set himself to persuade Griffiths through her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一刹那，菲利普像是着了魔，在他身体里久久潜伏的、自我折磨的心魔。尽管他全心希望米尔德里德不会同格里菲斯一起去巴黎，但他竟无法控制自己，非要让她劝服格里菲斯不行。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It is rather, isn't it?" she said, with a shameless little laugh. It sent a cold shudder down Philip's spine.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“真是变了不少，对吧？”她恬不知耻地嘿嘿笑了起来。菲利普觉得后脊梁一阵发冷。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“那你们到底打算做什么呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That would be Philip's salvation. With Griffiths out of the way he could get Mildred back. She knew no one in London, she would be thrown on to his society, and when they were alone together he could soon make her forget this infatuation. If he said nothing more he was safe. But he had a fiendish desire to break down their scruples, he wanted to know how abominably they could behave towards him; if he tempted them a little more they would yield, and he took a fierce joy at the thought of their dishonour. Though every word he spoke tortured him, he found in the torture a horrible delight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="菲利普的转机眼看就来了。只要格里菲斯不在两人中间碍事，他就能把米尔德里德赢回来。她在伦敦人生地不熟，只能和他待在一块儿。一旦只有他们两个在一起了，他就能很快让她不再迷恋格里菲斯。眼下，只要他乖乖闭上嘴就能平安无事。可他偏有一种邪恶的欲念，要打破这对狗男女的顾虑，想知道他们能在他眼皮底下干出怎样肮脏下流的勾当。如果他再多拿出点东西来当诱饵，怕是这两人就会乖乖上钩，一想到他们马上就要尊严扫地、为人不齿，他就觉得快活得紧。尽管从嘴里说出的每一个字对自己来说都是一种折磨，可同时，也带来一种诡异而变态的快感。">查看中文翻译</div>
