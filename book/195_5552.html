<div class="line_en">Hayward's visit did Philip a great deal of good. Each day his thoughts dwelt less on Mildred. He looked back upon the past with disgust. He could not understand how he had submitted to the dishonour of such a love; and when he thought of Mildred it was with angry hatred, because she had submitted him to so much humiliation. His imagination presented her to him now with her defects of person and manner exaggerated, so that he shuddered at the thought of having been connected with her.</div>

<div class="line_en">"It just shows how damned weak I am," he said to himself. The adventure was like a blunder that one had committed at a party so horrible that one felt nothing could be done to excuse it: the only remedy was to forget. His horror at the degradation he had suffered helped him. He was like a snake casting its skin and he looked upon the old covering with nausea. He exulted in the possession of himself once more; he realised how much of the delight of the world he had lost when he was absorbed in that madness which they called love; he had had enough of it; he did not want to be in love any more if love was that. Philip told Hayward something of what he had gone through.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我真他妈是个软蛋！”菲利普自言自语道。与米尔德里德的纠缠就像在众目睽睽下犯了大错，找不到借口开脱，唯一能做的补救就是赶快忘记。好在他本来就憎恶自己过去犯下的堕落。像条刚蜕了皮的蛇，看着刚刚摆脱掉的旧躯壳阵阵作呕。他觉得自己又回来了，高兴得不行。为了那被称作“爱情”的疯狂情感，对世上多少乐趣置之不理。他受够了，如果这就是爱，那宁可不要也罢。菲利普把自己的这段经历挑了一些讲给海沃德听。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Philip seemed really to be born again. He breathed the circumambient air as though he had never breathed it before, and he took a child's pleasure in all the facts of the world. He called his period of insanity six months' hard labour.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="菲利普仿佛大获重生，贪婪地呼吸着周围的空气，对世间大小事都像个孩子一样激动而好奇。他把那段时间的疯狂称之为“六个月的苦役”。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Hayward had only been settled in London a few days when Philip received from Blackstable, where it had been sent, a card for a private view at some picture gallery. He took Hayward, and, on looking at the catalogue, saw that Lawson had a picture in it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="海沃德刚在伦敦待了没几天，菲利普就收到一张从布莱克斯塔布尔寄来的卡片（这张卡片一开始寄到伯伯家了），邀请他去参加某家画廊的预展。他带着海沃德一同前往，在画廊的展出目录里看到了劳森的画。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This, a profile of Ruth Chalice, was tucked away in a corner, and Lawson was not far from it. He looked a little lost, in his large soft hat and loose, pale clothes, amongst the fashionable throng that had gathered for the private view. He greeted Philip with enthusiasm, and with his usual volubility told him that he had come to live in London, Ruth Chalice was a hussy, he had taken a studio, Paris was played out, he had a commission for a portrait, and they'd better dine together and have a good old talk. Philip reminded him of his acquaintance with Hayward, and was entertained to see that Lawson was slightly awed by Hayward's elegant clothes and grand manner. They sat upon him better than they had done in the shabby little studio which Lawson and Philip had shared.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="劳森展出的作品是一幅露丝·查理斯的肖像，挂在画廊里一个不起眼的角落，劳森就站在不远的地方。他戴着一顶硕大的软帽，套了件松松垮垮、颜色发白的外套，在一群衣冠楚楚的宾客中间怔怔立着，怅然若失。看到菲利普，他上前热情地打个招呼，像过去一样打开话匣子：他已经在伦敦落脚；查理斯就是个臭婊子；他租了间画室；巴黎已经完蛋了；有人托他画肖像；他们最好坐下来吃顿饭好好聊。菲利普把海沃德介绍给他，说这就是自己提过的那位朋友。劳森看海沃德气度不凡、穿戴讲究，不由得敬他三分，菲利普看在眼里，心里很是得意。他俩把劳森好一通奚落，言语比在巴黎那件简陋的画室里还要刻薄几分。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At dinner Lawson went on with his news. Flanagan had gone back to America. Clutton had disappeared. He had come to the conclusion that a man had no chance of doing anything so long as he was in contact with art and artists: the only thing was to get right away. To make the step easier he had quarrelled with all his friends in Paris. He developed a talent for telling them home truths, which made them bear with fortitude his declaration that he had done with that city and was settling in Gerona, a little town in the north of Spain which had attracted him when he saw it from the train on his way to Barcelona. He was living there now alone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吃饭的时候，劳森分享起自己这段时间的所见所闻。弗拉纳根跑回美国去了。克拉顿不见了人影。他早就发现要是和艺术、艺术家之间纠缠不清，那最后只能落下个一事无成的下场，唯一办法就是赶快逃，逃得远远的。为了这一步迈出得更简单些，他把所有在巴黎的朋友得罪了个遍。他学得一手哪壶不开提哪壶的本事，等他宣布自己要离开巴黎去赫罗那定居的时候，那些忍了他很久的朋友们倒是大大松了口气。赫罗那是西班牙北边的小镇，有次他坐火车去巴塞罗那的时候路过那里，被风光美景深深吸引了。他现在自己一个人住在那儿。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I wonder if he'll ever do any good," said Philip.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不知道他能有什么出息。”菲利普说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was interested in the human side of that struggle to express something which was so obscure in the man's mind that he was become morbid and querulous. Philip felt vaguely that he was himself in the same case, but with him it was the conduct of his life as a whole that perplexed him. That was his means of self-expression, and what he must do with it was not clear. But he had no time to continue with this train of thought, for Lawson poured out a frank recital of his affair with Ruth Chalice. She had left him for a young student who had just come from England, and was behaving in a scandalous fashion. Lawson really thought someone ought to step in and save the young man. She would ruin him. Philip gathered that Lawson's chief grievance was that the rupture had come in the middle of a portrait he was painting.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在艺术世界中，克拉顿专爱研究那些晦涩难懂的概念，试图将人头脑中不清不楚的想法表达出来。他也因此而变得病态、固执。菲利普觉得自己也有这样的特点，而让他困惑不解的则是整个的生活行为。还没来得及顺着往下想，劳森就拿他和露丝·查理斯的那点风流韵事打断了他的思路。查理斯跟着个年轻的学生跑了。那个小伙刚从英国来巴黎，作风大胆，让人咂舌。劳森还真心诚意地想过应该有个人来劝劝这个可怜的年轻人，救他于水火之中。露丝·查理斯会毁了他的。菲利普心想，劳森之所以这么伤心，大概是因为他给她的肖像还没画完呢，就先被戴上了顶绿油油的帽子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“克朗肖呢，他怎么样？”菲利普问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Women have no real feeling for art," he said. "They only pretend they have." But he finished philosophically enough: "However, I got four portraits out of her, and I'm not sure if the last I was working on would ever have been a success."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“女人哪懂什么艺术，”劳森说，“她们顶多就是不懂装懂。”他其实心里也算得很清，“可是，我给她画了四幅肖像，不确定这最后一幅还没完成的画能不能画好。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Philip envied the easy way in which the painter managed his love affairs. He had passed eighteen months pleasantly enough, had got an excellent model for nothing, and had parted from her at the end with no great pang.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="菲利普嫉妒劳森，因为他轻而易举就能摆平一段恋情。他和露丝·查理斯在一起快活了十八个月，相当于一点钱都没花就找了个绝佳的好模特。到头来要分手了，也没见他表现得要死要活。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I take it you did not conceal the fact from him."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我想你们没有对他隐瞒病情吧？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, he's done for," answered Lawson, with the cheerful callousness of his youth. "He'll be dead in six months. He got pneumonia last winter. He was in the English hospital for seven weeks, and when he came out they told him his only chance was to give up liquor."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他不行啦，”劳森毕竟年轻，即便是说起沉痛的话题，语气却还是没心没肺的，“不出六个月就要死了。去年冬天，他得了肺炎，在英国的医院住了七个礼拜，等出院的时候医生特地叮嘱他，想活命，就得戒酒。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Poor devil," smiled the abstemious Philip.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可怜的老头儿。”菲利普微笑着说。他从来都不贪食贪杯。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He kept off for a bit. He used to go to the Lilas all the same, he couldn't keep away from that, but he used to drink hot milk, avec de la fleur d'oranger, and he was damned dull."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他还真戒了一段时间。他不是习惯了去丁香园嘛，现在还是会去，但是只喝热牛奶或者桔子汁了。啧啧，真是没劲透了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh, he knew it himself. A little while ago he started on whiskey again. He said he was too old to turn over any new leaves. He would rather be happy for six months and die at the end of it than linger on for five years. And then I think he's been awfully hard up lately. You see, he didn't earn anything while he was ill, and the slut he lives with has been giving him a rotten time."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他自己心里可有数了。这不，没几天前，又开始喝起威士忌来了。他说自己这把年纪，改头换面为时已晚。痛痛快快在世上活六个月也好过蹑手蹑脚地多活上他五年。我这才忽然想到他最近日子实在过得窝囊，你瞧，病了之后，一个子儿没往家挣不说，那个贱婆娘还处处作践他。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Of course he was a rotter. He was bound to end in the gutter sooner or later," said Lawson.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“当然了，他就是个混子。早晚都要烂死在下水道里。”劳森说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Philip was hurt because Lawson would not see the pity of it. Of course it was cause and effect, but in the necessity with which one follows the other lay all tragedy of life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="劳森的冷酷心肠让菲利普觉得很伤心。虽然可怜之人必有可恨之处，但前有因，后有果，生活的悲剧就在于这一连串的因果效应中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, I'd forgotten," said Lawson. "Just after you left he sent round a present for you. I thought you'd be coming back and I didn't bother about it, and then I didn't think it worth sending on; but it'll come over to London with the rest of my things, and you can come to my studio one day and fetch it away if you want it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，差点忘了！”劳森说，“你刚走没多久，克朗肖就给你寄了份礼物。我当时以为你还会回巴黎呢，就没管它。后来觉得没必要单独给你寄，就随着我剩下的行李一起邮过来了。你要是愿意，就自己来我画室取吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>

But he was very drunk."</div>
