<div class="line_en">Cheng Xin and Guan Yifan were once again immersed in a time vacuum. The sensation was similar to when they had entered reduced lightspeed back in the shuttle. Time did not flow here, or maybe it was more accurate to say that time did not exist. They lost all sense of time, and experienced again that feeling of stepping across time, but existing outside of it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="程心和关一帆再次进入时间真空。这与他们在穿梭机中穿越低光速时十分相似，这里的时间流速为零，或者说没有时间。他们失去了时间感，代之以一种跨越感，在一切之外跨越一切的感觉。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The sun brightened. It did so very gradually: At first it was just a disk, and then the light began to unveil the world. It was like a song that began as barely audible notes, then grew and grew into a mighty chorus. A circle of blue appeared around the sun, expanded, and turned into a blue sky. Under the blue sky, a pastoral scene slowly took shape. There was an unplanted field with black soil; next to it was an exquisite white house. There were also a few trees that brought a hint of the exotic with their broad, strangely shaped leaves. As the sun continued to brighten, the peaceful scene appeared like a welcoming embrace.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="太阳亮起来，它亮得很慢，最初只能显示自己的圆盘形状，然后才用阳光揭开这个世界的面纱，像一首乐曲，从几乎听不见的音调渐渐流淌开来。太阳的周围出现一圈蓝色，慢慢扩展开来形成一片蓝天。在蓝色天空下，一片田园渐渐显形，或者说这只是田园的一角，有一片未播种的土地，土壤是黑色的。在土地旁有几幢精致的白色房子，还有几棵树，这树是唯一能带来异域色彩的东西，树的叶子阔大，形状奇异。在渐渐亮起来的太阳下，这片幽静的田园像对他们张开的怀抱。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There is no appropriate expression in human language to express the moment at the start of time. To say that time began after they entered the door would be wrong because "after" required time. There was no time here, and thus no before or after. The time "after" they entered could have been shorter than a billion-billionth of a second, or longer than a billion billion years.</div>

<div class="line_en">In front of those two figures, they could see a distant white house and trees, exact duplicates of the ones nearby. They couldn't see what was at the feet of those figures due to the distance, but they could guess that it was another black field. At the end of the world was a duplicate of it, or maybe a projection.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在那两个人前面更远处，也可以看到白房子和树，与这里的完全一样，由于角度原因看不到地面，但可以预料那里也有一块同这里一样的黑色田地。也就是说，在这个世界的尽头，又有一个该世界的复制品，也可能是映像。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Duplicates or projections of the world existed all around them. They looked to their sides and saw the same scene repeated. The two of them also existed in those worlds, but all they could see were the backs of those figures, who turned their heads away as Cheng Xin and Yifan turned to look at them. They looked behind them and saw the same thing -- except now they were looking at the world from the other direction.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="世界的复制品和映像在周围都存在，他们向两侧看，都看到一个同样的田园世界，他们也在那个世界中，但只能看到背影，他们转头时复制世界中的人也同时转头。他们向后看，吃惊地发现身后也是一个同样的田园世界，只不过他们是在从另一个方向看，那个田园中的他们远在另一端。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They followed a path of stepping-stones, and around them, the copies of themselves in the copies of their world walked along with them. The path was broken by a brook with no bridge over it, but the brook was so small that they could step over it. Only now did they realize that gravity was a standard 1G. They passed the copse of trees and came to the white house. The door was shut and the windows covered by blue curtains. Everything looked brand new, dustless -- as a matter of fact, they were brand new, also, as time had just begun to flow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们沿着一条石块铺出的小径向前走，周围所有复制世界中的他们也同时走动。一条小溪把小路切断了，溪上没有桥，但抬腿就能跳过去，这时他们才意识到这里有1G的正常重力。他们走过那几棵树，来到白房子前，发现房门关着，窗子被蓝色窗帘遮掩。这一切都是崭新的，一尘不染。它们也确实是崭新的，时间在这里刚刚开始流动。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In front of the house was a pile of simple, primitive farming tools: shovels, rakes, baskets, water pails, and so on. Although some of them were shaped a bit oddly, it was easy to tell their function by appearance. What most drew their attention, though, was a row of metal columns erected next to the farming tools. They were about the height of a person, and the smooth surfaces glinted in the sunlight. Each column had four metal attachments that seemed to be folded limbs. The columns were probably robots in a resting state.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在房子前堆放着一些简单原始的农具，有铁锹、钉耙、筐子和水桶等，虽然形状有些变异，但完全能看出它们的用途。最引人注目的是立在农具旁的一排金属柱状物。它们都有一人高，光滑的外壳在阳光下闪亮，每个上面都有四个金属部件，可以看出是折合的四肢，这些金属柱可能是关闭中的机器人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They decided to familiarize themselves with the environment before entering the house, and so they continued to walk past it. After a bit less than a kilometer, they reached the edge of the small world and faced the duplicate world before them. At first, they thought it was just a reflected image of their own world, though it was not mirrored. But after they were halfway there they decided that it couldn't be a reflection: Everything looked so real. They took a step forward and entered the duplicate world without any resistance. Looking around, Cheng Xin was struck with a hint of terror.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们决定先熟悉周围的环境再进入这些房子，于是继向前走，很快来到了这个小世界的边缘。现在，他们面对着前面的复制世界，最初，他们以为那是个映像，虽然无法解释它的方向，但走到一半时就否定了这个想法，因为那个复制世界太真切了，不像在镜子中。果然，他们向前迈一步就毫无阻碍地进入了复制世界，四下看看，程心的心中升起了一丝恐惧。">查看中文翻译</div>

They were in the same pastoral scene, with duplicates of the scene before them and to the sides, and in those copies, copies of them also existed. They turned around to look back, and they saw copies of themselves at the far end of the world they had just left, looking behind them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一切都恢复到他们刚进入时的状态：他们身处一个与刚才一模一样的田园中，前方、两侧都是这个田园的复制世界，在这些复制世界中，他们也存在。回头看看，在他们刚刚迈出的田园中，他们正在田园最远的一侧，也在回头看。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“没有。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"A physicist of the Common Era. He was the one who first came up with this concept. The world we're in is actually very simple. It's a regular cube about a kilometer on each side. You can imagine it as a room with four walls and a ceiling as well as a floor. But the room is constructed such that the ceiling is also the floor, and each wall is the same as the opposite wall. In reality, it has only two walls. If you walk through one of the walls, you'll immediately reappear at the opposite wall, and the same is true of the floor and ceiling. Thus, this is a completely enclosed world in which the end is also the beginning. The images we see all around us are the result of light returning to the starting point after crossing the world. We're still in the same world we started from, because this is the only world that exists. Every copy we see around us is just an image of this world."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他是公元世纪的一个物理学家，他是最早想象出这种东西的人。我们所在的世界其实很简单，是一个正立方体，边长我估计在一千米左右，你可以把它想象成一个房间，有四面墙，加上天花板和地板。但这房间的奇怪之处在于，它的天花板就是地板，在四面墙中，相对两面墙其实是一面墙，所以它实质上只有两面墙。如果你从一面墙前向对面的墙走去，当你走到对面的墙时，你立刻就回到了你出发时的那面墙前。天花板和地板也一样。所以，这是一个全封闭的世界，走到尽头就回到起点。至于我们周围看到的这些映像，也很简单，只是到达世界尽头的光又返回到起点的缘故。咱们现在还是在刚才的那个世界中，是从尽头返回起点，只有这一个世界，其他都是映像。”">查看中文翻译</div>

After they sat down at an antique wooden desk, Sophon poured tea for them -- without going through the complicated steps of the Way of Tea. The tea leaves seemed to be Longjing, and they stood up at the bottom of the cups like a tiny green forest, giving off a fresh fragrance.</div>

Right now, we exist in an independent timeline. Time is passing rapidly in the great universe, and you will certainly be able to see its end within your lifetimes.

He noticed that Sophon spoke of the "Edenic Age" of the new universe. This was a term invented by the Galactic humans. Two possibilities presented themselves. One was that coincidentally, the Trisolarans had also picked this term. The second possibility was far more terrifying: the Trisolarans had already discovered the Galactic humans. Given how quickly Yun Tianming had arrived on Planet Blue, it was apparent that the First Trisolaran Fleet was very close to the worlds of humankind. And now, the Trisolaran civilization had developed to the point where they were capable of constructing small universes: This was a great threat to humanity.</div>

<div class="line_en">But even more information existed in the databank written in the Trisolaran language. This massive ocean of data was what interested them the most. Since they couldn't find any software on the computer for translating Trisolaran writing into human languages, they had to study the Trisolaran script itself. Sophon acted as their teacher, but they soon discovered that this was an extremely difficult endeavor because Trisolaran writing was purely ideographic; unlike human scripts, which were mostly phonetic, Trisolaran writing had no connection to their speech, but expressed ideas directly. In the distant past, humans had also used ideographic scripts -- such as some hieroglyphs -- but most of these later disappeared.11 Humans read by decoding speech made visible. However, the difficulty didn't last long. The more they persisted, the easier the learning process became. After struggling for two months, they found themselves making rapid progress. Compared to phonetic scripts, the biggest advantage of an ideographic script was how fast one could read -- Cheng Xin and Guan Yifan read at least ten times as fast in Trisolaran as they did with human scripts.</div>

Sophon told them that there was no way for the mini-universe to transmit any information to the greater universe, but it was possible for the mini-universe to receive broadcasts from the great universe. She explained that all the universes were bubbles above a supermembrane -- this was a fundamental conceptual image from Trisolaran physics and cosmology, and she could explain it no further. The great universe had enough energy to propagate information across the supermembrane. However, this was difficult and required a great expenditure of energy -- the great universe would have to convert a Milky Way's worth of matter into pure energy. As a matter of fact, the monitoring systems in Universe 647 often received messages from other great universes on the supermembrane. Some were natural phenomena; some were messages from intelligent beings that could not be decoded -- but they had never received any message from the particular great universe they had come from.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sometimes, they also tried to imagine life in the new universe. Sophon told them that according to cosmological theories, the new universe was certain to possess more than four macro dimensions, perhaps even more than ten macro dimensions. After the birth of the new universe, Universe 647 could automatically construct an entrance to it and examine the interior conditions. If the new universe possessed more than four dimensions, the mini-universe's exit could be moved around until a suitable habitable location was found in the great universe. Simultaneously, their mini-universe could establish communications with the refugees of other Trisolaran mini-universes, or even with Galactic human migrants. In the new universe, all the migrants coming from the old universe would practically be one race, and should be able to work together to construct a new world. Sophon emphasized that one characteristic greatly increased the probability of survival in a high-dimensional universe: Out of the many macro dimensions, it was likely that more than one dimension would belong to time.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sophon had explained that the mini-universe had no matter of its own. All of its mass had come from material brought out of the great universe. Of the several hundred mini-universes constructed by the Trisolarans, Universe 647 was one of the smallest. In total, it required about five hundred thousand metric tons of matter from the great universe, which was about the carrying capacity of a large oil tanker. It was practically nothing at the scale of the universe.</div>

<div class="line_en">The door appeared in Universe 647. Like the door Cheng Xin and Guan Yifan had seen on Planet Blue, it was also a rectangle limned by glowing lines. But this door was much bigger, perhaps to make it easier to transport material through it. Initially, the door was not connected to the great universe, and anything could pass through it without leaving the mini-universe. Sophon adjusted its parameters so that anything moving through it would disappear and reappear in the great universe.</div>

The robots used a wheelbarrow to cart the moist earth; at the door, two of the robots lifted the wheelbarrow to dump the soil through the door; and the soil disappeared. It happened very quickly. Three days later, all the soil in the mini-universe was gone. Even the trees around the house had been returned through the door.</div>

Designed with human occupants in mind, it could seat three, and was equipped with both a nuclear fusion drive and a curvature drive. There was a miniature ecological cycling system aboard suitable for human needs as well as equipment for hibernation. Like Halo, it was capable of landing and taking off from planetary surfaces. It had a slender, streamlined profile, perhaps to make it easier to go through the mini-universe's door. It had been intended for the inhabitants of Universe 647 to enter the new great universe after the next big bang. It could serve as a living base for a considerable amount of time, until they found a suitable location in the new universe. But now, they would use it to return to the old great universe.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Can we keep another five kilograms here?" Cheng Xin asked. She was on the other side of the ship and dressed in her space suit. In her hand, she held a glowing, transparent sphere. The sphere was about half a meter in diameter, and a few balls of water drifted inside it. Inside some of the water spheres were tiny fish, along with green algae. There were also two miniature drifting continents covered with green grass. The light came from the top of the transparent sphere, where there was a tiny glowing emitter, the sun of this miniature world. This was a completely sealed ecological sphere, the result of more than ten days of work by Cheng Xin and Sophon. As long as the tiny sun inside the sphere continued to give off light, this miniature ecological system would persist. As long as it remained here, Universe 647 would not be a lifeless, dark world.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Of course," said Guan Yifan. "The great universe isn't going to fail to collapse because it misses five kilograms." He had another thought that he did not voice: Perhaps the great universe really would fail to collapse because it lacked a single atom's mass. The precision of Nature can sometimes exceed the imagination. For instance, life itself required the precise collaboration of various universal constants within a billion-billionth of a certain range. But Cheng Xin could still leave behind her ecological sphere. Out of all the countless mini-universes created by the countless civilizations, it was certain that some number of them would not heed the call of the Returners. Ultimately, the great universe was certain to lose at least a few hundred million tons of matter, or perhaps even a million billion billion tons.</div>
