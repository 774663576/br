<div class="line_en">"Oh, God, Phoebe, don't ask me. I'm sick of everybody asking me that," I said. "A million reasons why. It was one of the worst schools I ever went to. It was full of phonies. And mean guys. You never saw so many mean guys in your life. For instance, if you were having a bull session in somebody's room, and somebody wanted to come in, nobody'd let them in if they were some dopey, pimply guy. Everybody was always locking their door when somebody wanted to come in. And they had this goddam secret fraternity that I was too yellow not to join. There was this one pimply, boring guy, Robert Ackley, that wanted to get in. He kept trying to join, and they wouldn't let him. Just because he was boring and pimply. I don't even feel like talking about it. It was a stinking school. Take my word."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Even the couple of nice teachers on the faculty, they were phonies, too," I said. "There was this one old guy, Mr. Spencer. His wife was always giving you hot chocolate and all that stuff, and they were really pretty nice. But you should've seen him when the headmaster, old Thurmer, came in the history class and sat down in the back of the room. He was always coming in and sitting down in the back of the room for about a half an hour. He was supposed to be incognito or something. After a while, he'd be sitting back there and then he'd start interrupting what old Spencer was saying to crack a lot of corny jokes. Old Spencer'd practically kill himself chuckling and smiling and all, like as if Thurmer was a goddam prince or something."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“教职员里虽有那么一两个好教师，可连他们也都是假模假式的伪君子，”我说。“就拿那个老家伙斯宾塞先生说吧。他太大者请你喝热巧克力什么的，他们为人的确挺不错。可他上历史课的时候，只要校长老绥摩进来在教室后面一坐下，你再瞧瞧他的那副模样儿。老绥摩总是在上课的时候进来，在教室后面坐那么半个小时左右。他大概算是微行察访什么的。过了一会儿，他就会坐在那儿打断者斯宾塞的话，说一些粗俗的笑话。老斯宾塞简直连命都不要了，马上露出满面笑容，吃吃地笑个不停，就好象绥摩是个混帐王子什么的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It would've made you puke, I swear it would," I said. "Then, on Veterans' Day. They have this day, Veterans' Day, that all the jerks that graduated from Pencey around 1776 come back and walk all over the place, with their wives and children and everybody. You should've seen this one old guy that was about fifty. What he did was, he came in our room and knocked on the door and asked us if we'd mind if he used the bathroom. The bathroom was at the end of the corridor -- I don't know why the hell he asked us. You know what he said? He said he wanted to see if his initials were still in one of the can doors. What he did, he carved his goddam stupid sad old initials in one of the can doors about ninety years ago, and he wanted to see if they were still there. So my roommate and I walked him down to the bathroom and all, and we had to stand there while he looked for his initials in all the can doors. He kept talking to us the whole time, telling us how when he was at Pencey they were the happiest days of his life, and giving us a lot of advice for the future and all. Boy, did he depress me! I don't mean he was a bad guy -- he wasn't. But you don't have to be a bad guy to depress somebody -- you can be a good guy and do it. All you have to do to depress somebody is give them a lot of phony advice while you're looking for your initials in some can door -- that's all you have to do. I don't know. Maybe it wouldn't have been so bad if he hadn't been all out of breath. He was all out of breath from just climbing up the stairs, and the whole time he was looking for his initials he kept breathing hard, with his nostrils all funny and sad, while he kept telling Stradlater and I to get all we could out of Pencey. God, Phoebe! I can't explain. I just didn't like anything that was happening at Pencey. I can't explain."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你见了准会呕出来，我发誓你一定会，”我说。“还有，在“返校日”那天。他们有那么个日子，叫‘返校日’，那天所有在一七七六年左右打潘西毕业出去的傻瓜蛋全都回到学校来了，在学校里到处走，还带着自己的老婆孩子什么的。可惜你没看见那个约莫五十岁的老家伙。你猜他干了什么，他一径来到我们房间里敲我们的门，问我们是不是能让他用一下浴室。浴室是在走廊的尽头――我真他妈的不知道他干吗要来问我们。你知道他说了些什么？他说他想看看他自己名字的缩写是不是还在一扇厕所门上。他约莫在九十年前把他妈的那个混账傻名字的缩写刻在一扇厕所门上，现在他想看看那缩写是不是还在那儿。因此我跟我的同房间的那位一起陪着他走到浴室里，他就在一扇扇厕所门上找他名字的缩写，我们不得不站在那儿陪着他。在整个时间里他还滔滔不绝地跟我们讲着话，告诉我们说在潘西念书的那段时间怎样是他一辈子中最快乐的日子，他还给我们许许多多有关未来的忠告。嘿，他真让我心里烦极了！我倒不是说他是个坏人――他不是坏人。可是不一定是坏人才能让人心烦――你可以是个好人，却同时让人心烦。要人心烦很容易，你只要在哪扇门上找自己名字的缩写，同时给人许许多多假模假式的忠告――你只要这样做就成。我不知道。说不定他要不是那么呼噜呼噜直喘气，情形也许会好些。他刚走上楼梯，累得呼噜呼噜直喘气，他一边在门上找自己名字的缩写，一边直喘气，鼻孔那么一张一合的十分可笑，一边却还要跟我和斯特拉德莱塔讲话，要我们在潘西学到尽可能多的东西。天哪，菲芘！我解释不清楚。我就是不喜欢在潘西发生的一切。我解释不清楚。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"All right," I said. But the trouble was, I couldn't concentrate. About all I could think of were those two nuns that went around collecting dough in those beat-up old straw baskets. Especially the one with the glasses with those iron rims. And this boy I knew at Elkton Hills. There was this one boy at Elkton Hills, named James Castle, that wouldn't take back something he said about this very conceited boy, Phil Stabile. James Castle called him a very conceited guy, and one of Stabile's lousy friends went and squealed on him to Stabile. So Stabile, with about six other dirty bastards, went down to James Castle's room and went in and locked the goddam door and tried to make him take back what he said, but he wouldn't do it. So they started in on him. I won't even tell you what they did to him -- it's too repulsive -- but he still wouldn't take it back, old James Castle. And you should've seen him. He was a skinny little weak-looking guy, with wrists about as big as pencils. Finally, what he did, instead of taking back what he said, he jumped out the window. I was in the shower and all, and even I could hear him land outside. But I just thought something fell out the window, a radio or a desk or something, not a boy or anything. Then I heard everybody running through the corridor and down the stairs, so I put on my bathrobe and I ran downstairs too, and there was old James Castle laying right on the stone steps and all. He was dead, and his teeth, and blood, were all over the place, and nobody would even go near him. He had on this turtleneck sweater I'd lent him. All they did with the guys that were in the room with him was expel them. They didn't even go to jail.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好吧，”我说。不过问题是，我没法集中思想。我能想起的只是那两个拿着破篮子到处募捐的修女。尤其是戴着铁边眼镜的那个。还有我在爱尔克敦．希尔斯念书时认识的那个学生。爱尔克敦．希尔斯的那个学生名叫詹姆士。凯瑟尔，他说了另外一个十分自高自大的、名叫菲尔。斯戴比尔的学生一句不好听的话，却不肯收回他的话。詹姆士。凯瑟尔说他这人太自高自大，给斯戴比尔的一个混帐朋友听见了，就到斯戴比尔跟前去搬弄是非。于是斯戴比尔带了另外六个下流的杂种，走进詹姆士。凯瑟尔的房间，锁上那扇混帐房门，想叫他收回他自己所说的话，可他不肯收回。因此他们跟他动起手来。我甚至都不愿告诉你他们怎么对待他的――说出来实在太恶心了――可他依旧不肯收回他的话，那个老詹姆士。凯瑟尔。可惜你没见过他这个人，他长得又瘦又小，十分衰弱，手腕就跟笔管那么细。最后，他不但不肯收回他的话，反而打窗口跳出去了。我正在洗淋浴什么的，连我也听见他摔在外面地上的声音。可我还以为是什么东西掉在窗外了，一架收音机或者一张书桌什么的，没想到是人。接着我听见大伙儿全都涌进走廊奔下楼梯，因此我穿好浴衣也奔下楼去，看见老詹姆士。凯瑟尔直挺挺地躺在石级上面。他已经死了，到处都是牙齿和血，没有一个人甚至敢走近他。他身上还穿着我借给他的那件窄领运动衫。那些到他房间里迫害他的家伙只是绘开除出学校。他们甚至没进监牢。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Lawyers are all right, I guess -- but it doesn't appeal to me," I said. "I mean they're all right if they go around saving innocent guys' lives all the time, and like that, but you don't do that kind of stuff if you're a lawyer. All you do is make a lot of dough and play golf and play bridge and buy cars and drink Martinis and look like a hot-shot. And besides. Even if you did go around saving guys' lives and all, how would you know if you did it because you really wanted to save guys' lives, or because you did it because what you really wanted to do was be a terrific lawyer, with everybody slapping you on the back and congratulating you in court when the goddam trial was over, the reporters and everybody, the way it is in the dirty movies? How would you know you weren't being a phony? The trouble is, you wouldn't."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“律师倒是不错，我揣摩――可是不合我的胃口，”我说。“我是说他们要是老出去搭救受冤枉的人的性命，那倒是不错，可你一当了律师，就不干那样的事了。你只是挣许许多多钱，打高尔夫球，打桥牌，买汽车，喝马提尼酒，摆臭架子。再说，即便你真的出去救人性命了，你怎么知道这样做到底是因为你真的要救人性命呢，还是因为你真正的动机是想当一个红律师，只等审判一结束，那些记者什么的就会全向你涌来，人人在法庭上拍你的背，向你道贸，就象那些下流电影里演出的那样？你怎么知道自己不是个伪君子？问题是，你不知道。”">查看中文翻译</div>
