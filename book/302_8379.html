<div class="line_en">On their return from the park they found Willoughby's curricle andservant in waiting at the cottage, and Mrs. Dashwood was convinced thather conjecture had been just. So far it was all as she had foreseen; but on entering the house she beheld what no foresight had taught herto expect. They were no sooner in the passage than Marianne camehastily out of the parlour apparently in violent affliction, with herhandkerchief at her eyes; and without noticing them ran up stairs. Surprised and alarmed they proceeded directly into the room she hadjust quitted, where they found only Willoughby, who was leaning againstthe mantel-piece with his back towards them. He turned round on theircoming in, and his countenance shewed that he strongly partook of theemotion which over-powered Marianne.</div>

<div class="line_en">Elinor's uneasiness was at least equal to her mother's. She thought ofwhat had just passed with anxiety and distrust. Willoughby's behaviourin taking leave of them, his embarrassment, and affectation ofcheerfulness, and, above all, his unwillingness to accept her mother'sinvitation, a backwardness so unlike a lover, so unlike himself, greatly disturbed her. One moment she feared that no serious designhad ever been formed on his side; and the next that some unfortunatequarrel had taken place between him and her sister; -- the distress inwhich Marianne had quitted the room was such as a serious quarrel couldmost reasonably account for, though when she considered what Marianne'slove for him was, a quarrel seemed almost impossible.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃丽诺的忧虑并不亚于母亲。她想起刚才发生的事情，既焦急又疑惑。威洛比告别时的那些表现：神色本来十分窘迫，却要装出一副高高兴兴的样子；更为重要的是，他不肯接受母亲的邀请，畏畏缩缩的哪里像个情人？这一切都叫她深感不安。她时而担心威洛比从来不曾有过认真的打算，时而担心他和妹妹之间发生了不幸的争吵。玛丽安走出客厅时那么伤心，最能解释得通的就是双方当真吵了一场。不过，考虑到玛丽安那样爱他，争吵又似乎是不可能的。">查看中文翻译</div>

I ampersuaded that Mrs. Smith suspects his regard for Marianne, disapprovesof it, (perhaps because she has other views for him,) and on thataccount is eager to get him away; -- and that the business which shesends him off to transact is invented as an excuse to dismiss him. This is what I believe to have happened. He is, moreover, aware thatshe DOES disapprove the connection, he dares not therefore at presentconfess to her his engagement with Marianne, and he feels himselfobliged, from his dependent situation, to give into her schemes, andabsent himself from Devonshire for a while. You will tell me, I know, that this may or may NOT have happened; but I will listen to no cavil, unless you can point out any other method of understanding the affairas satisfactory at this.

You are resolved to think him blameable, because he took leaveof us with less affection than his usual behaviour has shewn.

Is nothing due to the man whom wehave all such reason to love, and no reason in the world to think illof?

Hehad just parted from my sister, had seen her leave him in the greatestaffliction; and if he felt obliged, from a fear of offending Mrs. Smith, to resist the temptation of returning here soon, and yet awarethat by declining your invitation, by saying that he was going away forsome time, he should seem to act an ungenerous, a suspicious part byour family, he might well be embarrassed and disturbed. In such acase, a plain and open avowal of his difficulties would have been moreto his honour I think, as well as more consistent with his generalcharacter; -- but I will not raise objections against any one's conducton so illiberal a foundation, as a difference in judgment from myself, or a deviation from what I may think right and consistent."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我希望他不会，也相信他不会，”埃丽诺嚷道，“我喜欢威洛比，真心实意地喜欢他。怀疑他是不是诚实，这使你感到痛苦，我心里也决不比你好受。这种怀疑是无意中形成的，我不会去有意加码。说实在的，他今天上午态度上的变化把我吓了一跳。他言谈反常，你待他那么好，他却丝毫没有诚挚相报。不过，这一切倒可以用你设想的他的处境来解释。他刚和我妹妹分手，眼看着她悲痛欲绝地跑开了。他害怕得罪支密斯太太，想早点回来又不敢，但他知道，他拒绝你的邀请，说他要离开一些日子，他将在我们一家人的心目中扮演一个形迹可疑的角色，那样他准会感到窘迫不安的。在这种情况下，我觉得他满可以直截了当地说明他的难处，这样做会更体面些，也更符合他的性格——但是我不想凭着这么狭小的气量，认为一个人和自己见解不同，或者不像我们想象的那样专一和得体，便对他的行为提出异议。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They saw nothing of Marianne till dinner time, when she entered theroom and took her place at the table without saying a word. Her eyeswere red and swollen; and it seemed as if her tears were even thenrestrained with difficulty. She avoided the looks of them all, couldneither eat nor speak, and after some time, on her mother's silentlypressing her hand with tender compassion, her small degree of fortitudewas quite overcome, she burst into tears and left the room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她们一直没有看见玛丽安，直到吃晚饭的时候，她才走进房来，一声不响地坐到桌前。她的眼圈又红又肿，看样子，即使在当时，她也是好不容易才忍住了自己的泪水。她尽力避开众人的目光，既不吃饭，也不说话。过了一会儿，母亲怀着亲切怜惜之情，不声不响地抓住了她的手。顿时，她那点微不足道的坚毅精神被彻底摧垮了——她眼泪夺眶而出，拔腿奔出房去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You speak very properly. Willoughby certainly does not deserve to besuspected. Though WE have not known him long, he is no stranger inthis part of the world; and who has ever spoken to his disadvantage? Had he been in a situation to act independently and marry immediately, it might have been odd that he should leave us without acknowledgingeverything to me at once: but this is not the case. It is anengagement in some respects not prosperously begun, for their marriagemust be at a very uncertain distance; and even secrecy, as far as itcan be observed, may now be very advisable."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你说得很对。威洛比当然无可怀疑。虽然我们认识他的时间不长，他在这里却并非陌生人。有谁说过他的坏话？假若他可以自己作主，马上结婚的话，他走之前不立即把什么事情都向我交代清楚才怪呢。可是情况并非如此。从某些方面看来，这是件开头并不顺当的婚约，因为结婚还是遥遥无期的事情。现在，只要行得通，就连保密也是十分明智的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This violent oppression of spirits continued the whole evening. Shewas without any power, because she was without any desire of commandover herself. The slightest mention of anything relative to Willoughbyoverpowered her in an instant; and though her family were mostanxiously attentive to her comfort, it was impossible for them, if theyspoke at all, to keep clear of every subject which her feelingsconnected with him.</div>
