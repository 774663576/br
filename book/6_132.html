<div class="line_en">"I want to have no secrets from you, Marian," Laura said, "but I'm sure you have already guessed what my married life is like. Sir Percival said such cruel things to me in Italy that I turned for comfort to my memories of those happy days with Walter Hartright. And I have to tell you, Marian, Sir Percival now knows that Walter is the man I loved."</div>

<div class="line_en">"It was at a party in Rome. Some people from London said I should have drawing lessons and recommended a Mr Hartright. I could not control myself when I heard his name and my husband noticed. "So it was him, was it?" he said, with a horrible smile. "Well, we will see about Mr Hartright. You will be sorry, and so will he, to the end of your lives." And Marian, he uses this knowledge like a whip to punish me, day in, day out."</div>

The messenger drove away in his cab, and the Count took my arm to walk home with me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我满怀感激地读完信，告诉信使我明白了信的意思。正说着，福斯科伯爵突然从拐角那边走了出来，出现在我的面前。我没有任何思想准备，两眼盯着他，一句话也说不出来。信使赶车离开了，伯爵挽着我的手臂往回走。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He talked pleasantly of this and that, and asked no questions about letters or messengers, so I assumed he had found out everything.

There was no point in trying to deceive him so I said nothing, and just tried to seem quite cool and calm.</div>

<div class="line_en">Dear Miss Halcombe -- Your letter has caused me great anxiety. It seems very likely that Lady Glyde's signature is needed so that a Loan of all or part of her ￡20,000 can be made to Sir Percival. This is almost certainly illegal, and Lady Glyde should not sign any document until I have examined it first.</div>

<div class="line_en">Back at the house we found that Sir Percival had returned, in an even worse mood than before, it seemed. When I told him Laura was out looking for her bracelet, he growled, "Bracelet or no bracelet, I shall expect to see her in the library in half an hour."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="回到庄园，我们发现珀西瓦尔爵士已经回来了，看上去情绪更加糟糕。我告诉他劳拉出去找手镯了，他生气地咕哝道：“什么手镯不手镯的，我半小时后必须在书房见她。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="我还没来得及从惊讶中回过神来，他就出去了。毫无疑问，是他施加了影响才有现在的变化。他发现我给伦敦写信并且收到了回信，于是他开始干预。还有很多事需要考虑，但我实在累极了，再加上天热，我睁不开眼睛，就这么睡着了。">查看中文翻译</div>

Your mother would not want you to lose it. "I jumped up, but her voice was so kind that I wasn't afraid. I asked her how she knew my mother. She said her name was Anne Catherick and asked me if I remembered as a little girl walking with her and my mother to the school in Limmeridge one day. I did remember. Suddenly I saw that we were like each other, but her face was pale and thin and tired. It was how my face might look after a long illness. "Why do you call me Miss Fairlie?" I asked, and she answered, "Because I love the name of Fairlie and hate the name of Glyde.""</div>

But no one answered and no one appeared.

<div class="line_en">I tried to speak normally, but could not. The Count left the library, then returned a few minutes later to say that Lady Glyde had the freedom of her own house again.

<div class="line_en">From time to time I looked behind me. Was I being followed? Or was my imagination playing tricks on me? By now I was suspicious of everything -- every tiny sound, every shadow on the road, every breath of wind.
