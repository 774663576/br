<div class="line_en">When she was able to stand, she looked at the shocked, frozen-faced Germans, fresh out of their packets. At their feet, she allowed herself to collapse, but only momentarily. A graze struck a match on the side of her face, where she'd met the ground. Her pulse flipped it over, frying it on both sides.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当她终于能站起来时，她看了看四周瞠目结舌的德国人，离开了人群。她记得自己曾晕倒在他们脚边，虽然只是片刻而已。她倒在地上的时候，一侧脸颊仿佛被火柴灼烧。她的脉搏在激烈地跳动，将这种灼烧感传遍了整张脸。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After perhaps thirty meters, just as a soldier turned around, the girl was felled. Hands were clamped upon her from behind and the boy next door brought her down. He forced her knees to the road and suffered the penalty. He collected her punches as if they were presents. Her bony hands and elbows were accepted with nothing but a few short moans. He accumulated the loud, clumsy specks of saliva and tears as if they were lovely to his face, and more important, he was able to hold her down.</div>
