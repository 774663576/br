<div class="line_en">The pinched sleeve of his jacket had thankfully come free when the casket fell, leaving Langdon now with two mobile arms. Even so, as he pressed upward on the ceiling of his tiny cell, he found it immovable. Oddly, he wished his sleeve were still caught. At least it might create a crack for some air.</div>

<div class="line_en">Langdon lay trapped beneath the overturned sarcophagus and felt his mind careening dangerously close to the brink. Trying to drive his thoughts in any direction other than the crushing space around him, Langdon urged his mind toward some logical process… mathematics, music, anything. But there was no room for calming thoughts. I can't move! I can't breathe!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登躺著困在那个倒盖下来的石棺内，觉得自己的精神也已经摇摇欲坠，濒临崩溃的险境了。他努力逼自己想任何事情，就是不要去想他置身的这个狭小空间，他设法让自己去思考一些逻辑的过程……数学、音乐，任何事都好。但他却缺乏冷静思考的空间。我动不了！我不能呼吸！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As Langdon pushed against the roof above, his sleeve fell back to reveal the faint glow of an old friend. Mickey. The greenish cartoon face seemed mocking now.</div>

<div class="line_en">Langdon probed the blackness for any other sign of light, but the casket rim was flush against the floor. Goddamn Italian perfectionists, he cursed, now imperiled by the same artistic excellence he taught his students to revere… impeccable edges, faultless parallels, and of course, use only of the most seamless and resilientCarrara marble.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登仔细在黑暗中寻索，想找出任何光线的迹象，但棺盒的边缘紧紧压著地板。该死的义大利完美主义者，他诅咒著，他曾教导自己学生崇敬的这份艺术卓越性，现在却害惨了他……无懈可击的边缘，完美无缺的平行线，而且当然，只使用最细緻无瑕又具弹性、产自卡拉拉的纯白大理石。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As the claustrophobic panic closed in, Langdon was overcome by images of the sarcophagus shrinking around him. Squeezed by delirium, he fought the illusion with every logical shred of intellect he had.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="幽闭恐惧症的恐慌逐渐逼近，兰登脑子裡浮现出种种石棺环绕他逐渐缩小的画面。在濒临精神错乱的边缘，他用尽自己的每一分逻辑思考力，跟那个幻觉奋战。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Lift the damn thing," he said aloud, pressing harder through the tangle of bones. The box shifted slightly. Setting his jaw, he heaved again. The box felt like a boulder, but this time it raised a quarter of an inch. A fleeting glimmer of light surrounded him, and then the casket thudded back down. Langdon lay panting in the dark. He tried to use his legs to lift as he had before, but now that the sarcophagus had fallen flat, there was no room even to straighten his knees.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="「把这该死的玩意儿举起来。」他大声说，透过压在身上那团纠结的骨头，往上推得更用力了。棺盒稍微动了一点点。他咬紧牙关，再度往上推。棺盒感觉上就像一颗大圆石，但这回抬高了四分之一吋。一线亮光闪了进来，然后石棺砰的一声又落回地上。兰登躺在黑暗裡喘著气。他本来打算像之前那样用脚去举，但现在石棺已经整个落下来贴地，他根本连膝盖都伸不直。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Images of flesh eaten from bone only served as a grim reminder that Langdon lay covered in human remains. The notion brought nausea and chills. But it also brought an idea.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吃肉见骨的画面只提醒兰登，他自己身上还罩著一堆人类骸骨。想到这个让他恶心又毛骨悚然，但他也因此想出一个点子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Sarcophagus," he stated aloud, with as much academic sterility as he could muster. But even erudition seemed to be his enemy today. Sarcophagus is from the Greek "sarx"meaning "flesh," and "phagein" meaning "to eat." I'm trapped in a box literally designed to "eat flesh."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="「石棺。」他开始大声说，尽可能用一种学者不带感情的口吻。但今天好像连他的学识也在跟他作对。石棺（sarcophagus）一字源自希腊文的sarx和phagein，sarx意思是「肉」，而phagein意思是「吃」。我困在一个名副其实的「吃肉」箱子裡了。（译注：Sarcophagus的希腊文字源，与一种常用于製作石棺的石灰岩有关，「吃肉」之名系因当时认为这种石灰岩可以分解尸体、使之被「吃掉」。）">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Fumbling blindly around the coffin, Langdon found a shard of bone. A rib maybe? He didn't care. All he wanted was a wedge. If he could lift the box, even a crack, and slide the bone fragment beneath the rim, then maybe enough air could…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登盲目地在石棺中四处摸索，发现了一小块骨头。或许是肋骨吧？无所谓，他只想找个楔子。如果他能举高这个棺盒，哪怕只是一点点缝隙，就可以把这片骨头塞到棺盒侧边的下方，这麽一来，或许就有足够的空气可以……">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Reaching across his body and wedging the tapered end of the bone into the crack between the floor and the coffin, Langdon reached up with his other hand and heaved skyward. The box did not move. Not even slightly. He tried again. For a moment, it seemed to tremble slightly, but that was all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登拿著那根骨头横过身体，把比较细的那端放在地板和棺材间的缝隙，然后双手伸起往上举。棺盒没动，连一点点都没有。他又试了一次。有那麽一刹那，棺盒好像稍稍抖了一下，但也就是这样了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Regrouping, he placed the tapered edge of the bone against the crack, and shifting his body, he wedged the bone against his shoulder, pinning it in place. Careful not to dislodge it, he raised both hands above him. As the stifling confine began to smother him, he felt a welling of intensified panic. It was the second time today he had been trapped with no air. Hollering aloud, Langdon thrust upward in one explosive motion. The casket jostled off the floor for an instant. But long enough. The bone shard he had braced against his shoulder slipped outward into the widening crack. When the casket fell again, the bone shattered. But this time Langdon could see the casket was propped up. A tiny slit of light showed beneath the rim.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他重新振作，把那根骨头的尖端靠著缝隙，然后挪动一下身体，用肩膀抵住那根骨头，固定住位置。他小心翼翼不要动到那根骨头，同时举起了双手。那股令人窒息的幽闭感觉开始扼住他，让他大为恐慌。这是他今天第二次被困在缺乏空气的地方。兰登大喊一声，双手随著情绪爆发而猛往上推。棺盒被推离地板只有仅仅片刻，但已经足够了。他肩膀抵著的那根断骨往外滑进张开的缝隙。然后石棺又落回原位，压碎了骨头。但这回兰登看得见棺盒还是稍稍突起一点，一小道光从边缘透了进来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">With the fetid stench and lack of oxygen choking the strength from his body, Langdon realized he only had time for one more effort. He also knew he would need both arms.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阵阵的骨骸恶臭加上缺乏氧气，榨光了兰登体内的所有气力，他明白自己只有再试一回的时间了。他也明白自己需要用上两隻手。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Exhausted, Langdon collapsed. Hoping the strangling sensation in his throat would pass, he waited. But it only worsened as the seconds passed. Whatever air was coming through the slit seemed imperceptible. Langdon wondered if it would be enough to keep him alive. And if so, for how long? If he passed out, who would know he was even in there?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登筋疲力尽地垮在地板上。他等待著，期望喉头被勒住的感觉会消失。可是过了好了会儿，他只觉得更糟。他似乎感觉不到那道小缝透进来的空气，不知道那道缝隙是否够他活下去。就算够，又能撑得了多久？要是他晕过去了，恐怕根本不会有人知道他在裡头吧？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">With arms like lead, Langdon raised his watch again: 10:12P. M. Fighting trembling fingers, he fumbled with the watch and made his final play. He twisted one of the tiny dials and pressed a button.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登觉得双手沉重如铅，再度举起手来看表：十点十二分。他颤抖著手指努力摸索手表，祭出最后一招。他扭动手表上的一个小转轮，按下一个键。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As consciousness faded, and the walls squeezed closer, Langdon felt the old fears sweep over him. He tried to imagine, as he had so many times, that he was in an open field. The image he conjured, however, was no help. The nightmare that had haunted him since his youth came crashing back…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登的知觉渐渐褪去，墙壁朝他挤得更紧了，他感觉到那股长年的恐惧淹没了他。他按照以往的老方法，试著想像自己身在一个开放空间。但他召唤来的影像却毫无帮助。那个他童年时代就蕴绕不去的梦魇又猛地涌上心头……">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Now, traversing this glorious field, the boy came across a pile of fieldstones. He figured it must be the foundation of an old homestead. He would not go near it. He knew better.

He shouted out, but his own voice was muted… like a dream.</div>

<div class="line_en">His arms clawed at the water, searching the walls of the hollow for something to grab onto. Only smooth stone. He had fallen through an abandoned well covering.
