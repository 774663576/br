<div class="line_en">When we arrived at the Taheris' home the next evening -- for lafz, the ceremony of "giving word" -- I had to park the Ford across the street. Their driveway was already jammed with cars. I wore a navy blue suit I had bought the previous day, after I had brought Baba home from _khastegari_. I checked my tie in the rearview mirror.</div>

They said their Salaams in respectful hushed tones.</div>

<div class="line_en">We sat in the crowded room, Baba and I next to each other, across from the general and his wife.

<div class="line_en">ACCORDING TO TRADITION, Soraya's family would have thrown the engagement party the Shirini-khori-or "Eating of the Sweets" ceremony. Then an engagement period would have followed which would have lasted a few months. Then the wedding, which would be paid for by Baba.</div>

<div class="line_en">Soraya and I never went out alone together while preparations for the wedding proceeded-since we weren't married yet, hadn't even had a Shirini-khori, it was considered improper. So I had to make do with going over to the Taheris with Baba for dinner. Sit across from Soraya at the dinner table. Imagine what it would be like to feel her head on my chest, smell her hair. Kiss her. Make love to her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在筹备婚礼期间，索拉雅和我从无独处的机会——因为我们还没有结婚，甚至连订婚都没有，那于礼不合。所以我只好满足于跟爸爸一起，到塔赫里家用晚餐。晚餐桌上，索拉雅坐在我对面。我想像着她把头放在我胸膛上，闻着她的秀发，那该是什么感觉呢？我想像着亲吻她，跟她做爱。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We all agreed that Soraya and I would forgo the Shirini-khori. Everyone knew the reason, so no one had to actually say it: that Baba didn't have months to live.</div>

<div class="line_en">Baba spent $35,000, nearly the balance of his life savings, on the awroussi, the wedding ceremony. He rented a large Afghan banquet hail in Fremont -- the man who owned it knew him from Kabul and gave him a substantial discount. Baba paid for the chilas, our matching wedding bands, and for the diamond ring I picked out. He bought my tuxedo, and my traditional green suit for the nika -- the swearing ceremony. For all the frenzied preparations that went into the wedding night-most of it, blessedly, by Khanum Taheri and her friends -- I remember only a handful of moments from it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="为了婚礼，爸爸花了三万五千美元，那几乎是他毕生的积蓄。他在弗里蒙特租了个很大的阿富汗宴会厅，老板是他在喀布尔的旧识，给了他优惠的折扣。爸爸请来了乐队，给我挑选的钻石戒指付款，给我买燕尾服，还有在誓约仪式要穿的传统绿色套装。在为婚礼之夜所做的全部乱糟糟的准备一幸好多数由塔赫里太太和她的朋友帮忙——中，我只记得屈指可数的几件事。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I remember walking toward the stage, now in my tuxedo, Soraya a veiled pan in white, our hands locked. Baba hobbled next to me, the general and his wife beside their daughter. A procession of uncles, aunts, and cousins followed as we made our way through the hail, parting a sea of applauding guests, blinking at flashing cameras. One of Soraya's cousins, Sharif jan's son, held a Koran over our heads as we inched along. The wedding song, ahesta boro, blared from the speakers, the same song the Russian soldier at the Mahipar checkpoint had sung the night Baba and I left Kabul: Make morning into a key and throw it into the well, Go slowly, my lovely moon, go slowly. Let the morning sun forget to rise in the east, Go slowly, my lovely moon, go slowly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我记得走向台上的情景，当时我穿着燕尾服，索拉雅蒙着面，穿着白色礼服，我们挽着手。爸爸紧挨着我，将军和他太太在他们的女儿那边，身后跟着一群亲戚，我们走向宴会厅。两旁是鼓掌喝彩的宾客，还有闪个不停的镜头。我和索拉雅并排站着，她的表弟，亲爱的沙利夫的儿子，在我们头上举起《可兰经》。扬声器传来婚礼歌谣，慢慢走，就是爸爸和我离开喀布尔那天晚上，玛希帕检查站那个俄国兵唱的那首。将清晨化成钥匙，扔到水井去慢慢走，我心爱的月亮，慢慢走让朝阳忘记从东方升起慢慢走，我心爱的月亮，慢慢走">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I remember our nika. We were seated around a table, Soraya and I dressed in green -- the color of Islam, but also the color of spring and new beginnings. I wore a suit, Soraya (the only woman at the table) a veiled long-sleeved dress. Baba, General Taheri (in a tuxedo this time), and several of Soraya's uncles were also present at the table. Soraya and I looked down, solemnly respectful, casting only sideway glances at each other. The mullah questioned the witnesses and read from the Koran. We said our oaths. Signed the certificates. One of Soraya's uncles from Virginia, Sharif jan, Khanum Taheri's brother, stood up and cleared his throat. Soraya had told me that he had lived in the U. S. for more than twenty years. He worked for the INS and had an American wife. He was also a poet. A small man with a birdlike face and fluffy hair, he read a lengthy poem dedicated to Soraya, jotted down on hotel stationery paper. "Wah wah, Sharifjan!" everyone exclaimed when he finished.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我记得我们的誓约仪式。大家围着一张桌子坐下，索拉雅和我穿着绿色的衣服——伊斯兰的颜色，但也是春天和新起点的颜色。我穿着套装，索拉雅（桌子上惟一的女子）蒙着面，穿长袖衣服。爸爸、塔赫里将军（这回他穿着燕尾服）还有索拉雅几个叔伯舅舅也坐在桌子上。索拉雅和我低着头，表情神圣而庄重，只能偷偷斜视对方。毛拉向证人提问，读起《可兰经》。我们发誓，在结婚证书上签名。索拉雅的舅舅，塔赫里太太的兄弟，来自弗吉尼亚，站起来，清清他的喉咙。索拉雅曾告诉过我，他在美国生活已经超过二十年。他在移民局工作，娶了个美国老婆。他还是个诗人，个子矮小，鸟儿似的脸庞，头发蓬松。他念了一首献给索拉雅的长诗，那是草草写在酒店的信纸上。“哇！哇！亲爱的沙利夫！”他一念完，每个人都欢呼起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I picture colorful platters of chopan kabob, sholeh-goshti, and wild-orange rice. I see Baba between us on the sofa, smiling. I remember sweat-drenched men dancing the traditional attan in a circle, bouncing, spinning faster and faster with the feverish tempo of the tabla, until all but a few dropped out of the ring with exhaustion. I remember wishing Rahim Khan were there. And I remember wondering if Hassan too had married. And if so, whose face he had seen in the mirror under the veil? Whose henna-painted hands had he held?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我记得各色佳肴，有烤肉，炖肉饭，野橙子饭。我看见爸爸夹在我们两个中间，坐在沙发上，面带微笑。我记得浑身大汗的男人围成一圈，跳着传统舞蹈，他们跳跃着，在手鼓热烈的节拍之下越转越快，直到有人精疲力竭，退出那个圆圈。我记得我希望拉辛汗也在。并且，我还记得，我寻思哈桑是不是也结婚了。如果是的话，他蒙着头巾，在镜子中看到的那张脸是谁呢？他手里握着那涂了指甲花的手是谁的？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I remember sitting on the sofa, set on the stage like a throne, Soraya's hand in mine, as three hundred or so faces looked on. We did Ayena Masshaf, where they gave us a mirror and threw a veil over our heads, so we'd be alone to gaze at each other's reflection. Looking at Soraya's smiling face in that mirror, in the momentary privacy of the veil, I whispered to her for the first time that I loved her. A blush, red like henna, bloomed on her cheeks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我记得我们坐在沙发上，舞台上那对沙发好像王位，索拉雅拉着我的手，大约三百位客人注视着我们。我们举行另外的仪式。在那儿，人们拿给我们一面镜子，在我们头上覆上一条纱巾，留下我们两个凝望彼此在镜子中的容颜。看到镜子中索拉雅笑靥如花，我第一次低声对她说我爱她。一阵指甲花般的红晕在她脸庞绽放。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Liar." I lifted Baba's blanket. "What's this?" I said, though as soon as I picked up the leather-bound book, I knew. I traced my fingers along the gold-stitched borders.

<div class="line_en">A MONTH AFTER THE WEDDING, the Taheris, Sharif, his wife Suzy, and several of Soraya's aunts came over to our apartment for dinner. Soraya made sabzi challow -- white rice with spinach and lamb. After dinner, we all had green tea and played cards in groups of four. Soraya and I played with Sharif and Suzy on the coffee table, next to the couch where Baba lay under a wool blanket. He watched me joking with Sharif, watched Soraya and me lacing our fingers together, watched me push back a loose curl of her hair. I could see his internal smile, as wide as the skies of Kabul on nights when the poplars shivered and the sound of crickets swelled in the gardens.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="婚礼之后一个月，塔赫里夫妇、沙利夫和他的妻子苏丝，还有索拉雅几个阿姨到我们家吃晚饭。索拉雅用白米饭、菠菜和羊肉招待客人。晚饭后，大家都喝着绿茶，四人一组打扑克牌。索拉雅和我在咖啡桌上跟沙利夫两口子对垒，旁边就是沙发，爸爸躺在上面，盖着毛毯。他看着我和沙利夫开玩笑，看着索拉雅和我勾指头，看着我帮她掠起一丝滑落的秀发。我能见到他发自内心的微笑，辽阔如同喀布尔的夜空，那些白杨树沙沙响、蟋蟀在花园啾啾叫的夜晚。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Baba couldn't show me the way anymore; I'd have to find it on my own. The thought of it terrified me. Earlier, at the gravesite in the small Muslim section of the cemetery, I had watched them lower Baba into the hole. The mulIah and another man got into an argument over which was the correct ayat of the Koran to recite at the gravesite. It might have turned ugly had General Taheri not intervened. The mullah chose an ayat and recited it, casting the other fellow nasty glances. I watched them toss the first shovelful of dirt into the grave. Then I left. Walked to the other side of the cemetery. Sat in the shade of a red maple.</div>

<div class="line_en">BECAUSE SORAYA AND I never had an engagement period, much of what I learned about the Taheris I learned after I married into their family. For example, I learned that, once a month, the general suffered from blinding migraines that lasted almost a week. When the headaches struck, the general went to his room, undressed, turned off the light, locked the door, and didn't come out until the pain subsided. No one was allowed to go in, no one was allowed to knock. Eventually, he would emerge, dressed in his gray suit once more, smelling of sleep and bedsheets, his eyes puffy and bloodshot. I learned from Soraya that he and Khanum Taheri had slept in separate rooms for as long as she could remember. I learned that he could be petty, such as when he'd take a bite of the _qurma_ his wife placed before him, sigh, and push it away. "I'll make you something else," Khanum Taheri would say, but he'd ignore her, sulk, and eat bread and onion. This made Soraya angry and her mother cry. Soraya told me he took antide pressants. I learned that he had kept his family on welfare and had never held a job in the U. S., preferring to cash government-issued checks than degrading himself with work unsuitable for a man of his stature -- he saw the flea market only as a hobby, a way to socialize with his fellow Afghans. The general believed that, sooner or later, Afghanistan would be freed, the monarchy restored, and his services would once again be called upon. So every day, he donned his gray suit, wound his pocket watch, and waited.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="由于我和索拉雅没有经历过订婚期，我对塔赫里一家的了解，多半是来自婚后。例如，将军患有严重的偏头痛，每月发作一次，持续将近一个星期。当头痛难忍的时候，将军到自己的房间去，脱光衣服，关掉电灯，把门锁上，直到疼痛消退才走出来。他不许任何人进去，不许任何人敲门。他终究会出来，穿着那身灰色的西装，散发着睡眠和床单的气味，血红的双眼浮肿。我从索拉雅口中得知，自她懂事起，将军就和塔赫里太太分房睡。我还知道他有时很小气，比如说他妻子把菜肴摆在他面前，他会尝一口，就叹着气把它推开。“我给你做别的。”塔赫里太太会说。但他不理不睬，阴沉着脸，只顾吃面包和洋葱。这让索拉雅很恼怒，让她妈妈哭起来。索拉雅告诉我，说他服用抗抑郁的药物。我了解到他靠救济金生活，而他到了美国之后还没工作过，宁愿用政府签发的支票去换现金，也不愿自贬身份，去干那些与他地位不配的活儿。至于跳蚤市场的营生，在他看来只是个爱好，一种可以跟他的阿富汗朋友交际的方式。将军相信，迟早有一天，阿富汗会解放，君主制会恢复，而当权者会再次征召他服役。所以他每天穿上那身灰色套装，捂着怀表，等待时来运转。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I learned that Khanum Taheri -- whom I called Khala Jamila now -- had once been famous in Kabul for her enchanting singing voice. Though she had never sung professionally, she had had the talent to -- I learned she could sing folk songs, ghazals, even raga, which was usually a man's domain. But as much as the general appreciated listening to music -- he owned, in fact, a considerable collection of classical ghazal tapes by Afghan and Hindi singers -- he believed the performing of it best left to those with lesser reputations. That she never sing in public had been one of the general's conditions when they had married. Soraya told me that her mother had wanted to sing at our wedding, only one song, but the general gave her one of his looks and the matter was buried. Khala Jamila played the lotto once a week and watched Johnny Carson every night. She spent her days in the garden, tending to her roses, geraniums, potato vines, and orchids.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我了解到塔赫里太太——现在我管她叫雅米拉阿姨——在喀布尔时，一度以美妙的歌喉闻名。虽然她从不曾得到专业训练，但她有唱歌的天赋——我听说她会唱民歌、情歌，甚至还会唱“拉格”，【Raga，印度的一种传统音乐】这可通常是男人才唱的。可是，尽管将军非常喜欢听音乐——实际上，他拥有大量阿富汗和印度歌星演唱的经典情歌磁带，他认为演唱的事情最好还是留给那些地位低下的人去做。他们结婚的时候，将军的条款之一就是，她永远不能在公开场合唱歌。索拉雅告诉我，她妈妈本来很想在我们的婚礼上高歌一曲，只唱一首，但将军冷冷地盯了她一眼，这事就不了了之。雅米拉阿姨每周买一次彩票，每晚看强尼·卡森【Johnny Carson（1925—2005），美国著名电视节目主持人】的节目。白天她在花园里劳动，照料她的蔷薇、天竺葵、土豆藤和胡姬花。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When I married Soraya, the flowers and Johnny Carson took a backseat. I was the new delight in Khala Jamila's life. Unlike the general's guarded and diplomatic manners -- he didn't correct me when I continued to call him "General Sahib" -- Khala Jamila made no secret of how much she adored me. For one thing, I listened to her impressive list of maladies, something the general had long turned a deaf ear to. Soraya told me that, ever since her mother's stroke, every flutter in her chest was a heart attack, every aching joint the onset of rheumatoid arthritis, and every twitch of the eye another stroke. I remember the first time Khala Jamila mentioned a lump in her neck to me. "I'll skip school tomorrow and take you to the doctor," I said, to which the general smiled and said, "Then you might as well turn in your books for good, bachem. Your khala's medical charts are like the works of Rumi: They come in volumes."</div>

<div class="line_en">But it wasn't just that she'd found an audience for her monologues of illness. I firmly believed that if I had picked up a rifle and gone on a murdering rampage, I would have still had the benefit of her unblinking love. Because I had rid her heart of its gravest malady. I had relieved her of the greatest fear of every Afghan mother: that no honorable khastegar would ask for her daughter's hand. That her daughter would age alone, husbandless, childless. Every woman needed a husband. Even if he did silence the song in her. And, from Soraya, I learned the details of what had happened in Virginia. We were at a wedding. Soraya's uncle, Sharif, the one who worked for the INS, was marrying his son to an Afghan girl from Newark. The wedding was at the same hall where, six months prior, Soraya and I had had our awroussi. We were standing in a crowd of guests, watching the bride accept rings from the groom's family, when we overheard two middle-aged women talking, their backs to us.</div>

Maybe this was my punishment, and perhaps justly so. It wasn't meant to be, Khala Jamila had said. Or, maybe, it was meant not to be.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们都有不收养的理由。索拉雅有她的理由，将军有他的理由，而我的理由是：也许在某个地方，有某个人，因为某件事，决定剥夺我为人父的权利，以报复我曾经的所作所为。也许这是我的报应，也许这样是罪有应得。也许事情不是这样的。雅米拉阿姨说。或者，也许事情注定是这样的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">SOMETIMES, SORAYA SLEEPING NEXT TO ME, I lay in bed and listened to the screen door swinging open and shut with the breeze, to the crickets chirping in the yard. And I could almost feel the emptiness in Soraya's womb, like it was a living, breathing thing. It had seeped into our marriage, that emptiness, into our laughs, and our lovemaking. And late at night, in the darkness of our room, I'd feel it rising from Soraya and settling between us. Sleeping between us. Like a newborn child.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有时候，索拉雅睡在我身旁，我躺在床上，听着纱门在和风吹拂下开开关关，听着蟋蟀在院子里鸣叫。我几乎能感知到索拉雅子宫里的虚空，它好像是个活着的、会呼吸的东西。它渗进我们的婚姻，那虚空，渗进我们的笑声，还有我们的交欢。每当夜阑人静，我会察觉到它从索拉雅身上升起，横亘在我们之间。像新生儿那样，睡在我们中间。">查看中文翻译</div>
