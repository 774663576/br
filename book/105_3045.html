<div class="line_en">The first heavy drops of rain announced themselves, tapping out a disjointed rhythm on the tin roof over the train platform. Dylan sighed and plunged her face down deeper into her thick winter jacket, trying to warm her freezing nose. She could feel her feet going numb, and she stamped her boots on the cracked concrete to get her circulation going. She glared morosely at the slick, black train tracks littered with crisp packets, rusting Irn Bru cans and bits of broken umbrella. The train was fifteen minutes late and she had arrived ten minutes early in her eagerness. There was nothing to do but stand, stare and feel her body heat slowly seeping away.</div>

<div class="line_en">As the rain began to fall more steadily, the stranger beside her tried in vain to continue reading his free newspaper, absorbed in a story about a gruesome murder spree in the West End. The roof provided feeble cover, and droplets fell thickly onto the paper, exploding and expanding, the ink running into a blotchy mess. Grumbling audibly, he folded it up and stuffed it under his arm. The man glanced around, searching for a new distraction, and Dylan immediately looked away. She did not want to have to make polite conversation.</div>

<div class="line_en">Her mother's voice rang out, barging in on a dream involving a handsome stranger. Its screech had the ability to cut through glass, so Dylan's subconscious offered little challenge. Her mother continued to complain as she marched back down the long corridor of their tenement flat, but Dylan had already tuned out. She was trying to remember the dream, to hold on to some of the details for a later daydream. Walking slowly… a hand, warm around hers… the scent of foliage and damp earthiness heady in the air. Dylan smiled, feeling warmth bubble in her chest, but the chill of the morning dissolved the image before she could lock his face into her mind. Sighing, she forced her eyes open and stretched, luxuriating in the cosy warmth of her thick duvet, then squinted left towards her alarm clock.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="正梦到一个陌生的帅哥，母亲的大嗓门就骤然响起，扫兴地搅了那场美梦。她尖利的嗓门恐怕连玻璃都能穿透，所以迪伦的潜意识并未做过多的反抗。母亲一边穿过经济公寓长长的走廊返身回去，一边在继续抱怨。但迪伦不去理睬这些，她还在尽力回忆刚才的梦，想抓住这场迟来的白日梦里一鳞半爪的细节。步履缓慢……一只手，温暖的手搂着她……空气里弥漫着树叶和潮湿泥土的气息。迪伦笑了，感觉胸中一股暖意微微荡漾。可是还没等她在心里锁定他的脸，清晨的寒气就把这幻象吹散了。她叹口气，努力睁开眼，伸着懒腰，赖在厚羽绒被舒适的暖意中，然后乜斜着眼向左瞥了一下闹钟。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She was going to be so late. Scrambling around her room, she tried to pull together enough clean clothes to create a full school uniform. A brush through her brown, shoulder-length hair created the usual frizzy mess. Dylan didn't even glance at her reflection as she reached for the bobble that would hide her bad hair life in an inconspicuous bun. How other girls managed to create artfully styled, perfect hairdos was a mystery to her. Even when she made an effort to blow-dry and straighten, two seconds outside was enough to return her unruly hair to its natural state.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="要迟到了。她在小屋里忙得团团转，想赶紧把校服穿戴整齐。棕色的齐肩长发中有一缕头发又照例卷成了一团。迪伦根本顾不上看镜子中的自己，伸手便去够橡皮筋，这东西能把她可怜巴巴的头发藏在不起眼的发髻当中。其他女孩子到底是怎么理出那么精巧、完美的发型来的呢？这对她来说仍是一个谜。不管她如何用吹风机吹、用手压，那一头乱发总能在她出门的瞬间故态复萌。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Having no shower was out of the question, but today she had to make do with a quick twirl under the water that was scalding hot, irrespective of which knobs were twirled or buttons pushed. She scraped a rough towel against her skin and yanked on the black skirt, white shirt and green tie that made up her uniform. In her haste, she caught a jaggy nail on her last pair of tights and ripped a huge ladder in them. Grinding her teeth, she lobbed them in the bin and clattered, bare legged, down the hall to the kitchen.</div>

<div class="line_en">Setting off without breakfast was also highly undesirable, but a glimpse in the fridge -- and a desperately optimistic peek into the larder -- revealed nothing that could be eaten on the run. If she'd been earlier she could have dashed into a café on the way to school and grabbed a bacon roll, but there was no time for that now. She would just have to be hungry. At least she had enough money left on her school dinner card for a decent meal. It was Friday, that usually meant fish and chips -- although of course there would be no salt, vinegar or even ketchup. Not in our health-mad school, Dylan thought, rolling her eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="像这样不吃早饭就出门也是绝对无法忍受的。她先看了一眼冰箱，然后又满怀希望地偷偷看了看食品橱，结果却没有什么东西可以让她边跑边吃。她要是早起一会儿，就可以在上学途中冲进小餐馆，再买上一个培根肉卷吃，但是现在没时间了。她肯定会感到饿的，但至少学校饭卡上剩的钱足够她吃一顿大餐了。今天是周五，这就意味着可以吃到炸鱼薯条—尽管里面不放盐、不放醋，甚至连番茄酱都没有。学校注重健康都快神经质了，什么调料都没有。她想到这些，翻了个白眼。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Joan looked as if she had many more things to say, but instead she simply shook her head and turned away. Dylan listened to her footsteps echo down the hall. It was easy to guess the reason for her mother's bad mood. She highly disapproved of Dylan's weekend trip to see her father, the man Joan had once pledged her life to -- promised to have and to hold until death, or in this case life, did them part.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="琼看起来似乎还有很多话要说，但最后她只是摇了摇头，转身离开了。迪伦听着她的脚步声在客厅回响，要猜中她妈妈为什么心情那么糟其实也不难，她本就对迪伦在周末去见她父亲十分不满。那个琼曾经海誓山盟爱过的男人，那个曾发誓跟她相爱相守至死不渝的男人，现在已经甩下她们母女去过新生活了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Anticipating that Joan had not given up on the matter, Dylan quickly threw her shoes on, grabbed her school bag and stomped down the hall, trying to ignore the grumbling that was already coming from her stomach. It was going to be a long morning. She paused at the door to yell a compulsory goodbye, one that was met with silence, before traipsing out into the rain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦料到琼不会善罢甘休，所以赶紧穿上鞋，抓起校服帽子，顺着客厅跑下去，尽力忽略肚子里传来的咕噜声。这个早晨一定会很漫长。她停在门口，仿佛尽义务一般喊了句“再见”，却无人回应，她就这样拖着疲惫的脚步走入了雨中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">By the time she had walked the fifteen minutes to school, the cheap winter jacket she wore had given up the fight against the drizzle and she could feel the wet leaking into her shirt. A sudden, hideous thought made her stop in her tracks, despite the downpour. White shirt. Rain. Wet shirt. She remembered rooting through her underwear drawer searching for a clean bra and coming up with only one -- a navy one.</div>

<div class="line_en">Head down into the rain, she stomped along the high street, past the charity shops, boarded-up failed dreams, cafés with cheap furniture and extortionate cakes, and the obligatory betting shop or two. There was no longer any point in trying to avoid the puddles, her feet were already soaked through; they were now the least of her worries. For a moment she considered crossing the road and hiding in the park until Joan left for work, but she knew herself better than that. She just didn't have the nerve. Muttering a stream of complaints interspersed with obscenities, she turned off the high street and through the gates of Kaithshall Academy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦低着头冲进雨中，她在街上跺着脚，经过封存着破碎梦想的慈善商店，只有廉价家具和贵得离谱的蛋糕的咖啡馆，一两家彩票投注站。再努力躲水坑已经没有任何意义了，她的脚已经湿透了，现在它们最不用她操心。有那么一瞬间，她想到了穿过马路，然后躲在公园里，一直躲到琼出门上班。不过她还不至于那样做，因为她没这样的胆量。迪伦低声吐出一连串的抱怨，中间夹杂着几句脏话，然后转过大街，走进了吉斯夏尔中学。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Three floors of uniform boxes in various stages of disrepair, the school, Dylan was sure, had been designed to curb enthusiasm, creativity and, most importantly, spirit. Registration was in Miss Parson's room on the top floor -- another tired-looking cube that the teacher had tried to brighten with posters and wall displays. Strangely, her efforts only made the room more depressing -- especially now, filled with thirty clones chattering inconsequential rubbish as if it were life-altering drama.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="三层楼整齐划一的若干小隔间，年久失修的程度各不相同。迪伦确信，这所学校专门磨平人的热情、创造力，更重要的是，消磨人的意志。签到是在顶楼帕森小姐的教室—又一处“满目倦容”的立方体。帕森小姐尽力想用标语和展示墙给屋里增添一点生气，可奇怪的是，她的一番心血却让屋子看起来更加压抑了。特别是现在，屋子里坐了三十个人形机器人，个个都在说着毫无价值的废话，就好像正在演一出能改变生活的大戏。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dylan considered resisting, but knew it would be futile. Besides, any further complaints would draw attention to her, something she tried to avoid as a rule. Sighing, she battled with the cheap zip and shrugged the jacket off. A glance down confirmed her fears. The sodden blouse was transparent, and under it her bra seemed to glare like a beacon. She hunched down in her chair and wondered how long she could hope to remain invisible.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦想要反抗，但知道反抗是徒劳的。而且，再多抱怨几句反而会招来更多人的注意，而平常她一直都在避免成为别人关注的焦点。迪伦叹了口气。她和外套的廉价拉链斗争了一会儿，终于将衣服脱了下来。周围人投过来的目光证实了她的担心，湿透的衬衫完全变得透明，里面的文胸像灯塔一样明显。她只有弓着腰趴在座位上，不知道自己能隐形多久不被发现。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"What? What is it?" The harsh, snide voice of David 'Dove' MacMillan cut across the titters. Dylan looked resolutely at the front board, but in her mind's eye she constructed a crystal-clear image of Cheryl and her cronies smiling gleefully as they pointed perfectly manicured nails in her direction. Dove was so dense it would take him another few seconds to realise they were even pointing at her, and he would never work out the joke without a sledgehammer-sized clue. Cheryl would provide that service, mouthing, "Check out the bra," or perhaps a suitably obscene hand gesture. Sign language was more on the level of the moronic boys in this class.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“什么？什么啊？”一片哂笑声中夹杂着绰号“鸽子”的大卫·麦克米兰挖苦人的尖嗓子。迪伦神色专注地直视黑板，心里却已经勾勒出了一幅异常清晰的画面：谢莉尔和她的死党们正乐不可支地用她们精心修剪过的指甲朝她的方向指指点点。这个“鸽子”也真够笨的，又花了好几秒钟才明白她们在指谁，平时非要给他一个超级明确的提示他才能明白笑点在哪儿。谢莉尔会帮他找到笑点的，她会用口型暗示他“看看她的文胸”，也可能做一个相应的下流手势，打手语更适合班里这些低能迟钝的男生。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ever since Katie had left, there was no one at this school who even gave the impression of being on the same planet as Dylan, never mind being part of the same species. They were sheep, all of them. The boys wore tracksuits, listened to hip hop and spent their evenings down at the skatepark. Not skating, just vandalising things and drinking any booze they'd managed to get their hands on. The girls were worse. Five layers of make-up turning them orange, and catty, screeching voices picked up from watching re-runs of American teen dramas on E4. The twelve cans of hairspray that their 'look' required seemed to have turned their brains to mush, because they couldn't have a conversation unless it involved tanning, atrocious pop music or -- most disturbing of all -- which of the tracksuited Casanovas was the most appealing. Of course, there were other outsiders, but they tended to be loners too, just trying to get by and avoid being targeted by the mob.</div>

<div class="line_en">Katie had been her one companion. They'd known each other since primary school and spent their time quietly mocking their fellow classmates and plotting a way out of the place. Last year that had all changed. Katie's parents had decided that, as they despised each other, the time had come to split. They'd hated each other as long as Dylan had known Katie, so she couldn't understand why it had to happen now. But it had. Katie had been forced to choose between living with her alcoholic father in Glasgow, or moving away with her obsessive mother. Dylan hadn't envied her the choice. Caught between a rock and a hard place, she'd chosen to go with her mother, to a tiny village in Lanarkshire called Lesmahagow. It might as well have been on the other side of the world. Since she'd gone, life had been a lot harder, and a lot lonelier. Dylan missed her friend. She wouldn't have laughed at the see-through shirt for a start.</div>

<div class="line_en">Although the shirt had dried out by halfway through first period, the damage was done. Everywhere she went, boys from her year -- and some she didn't even know -- followed her and laughed, making sarcastic comments and attempting to ping her bra strap (just to check it was still there). By lunchtime, Dylan had had enough. She was sick of the immature boys making fun of her, sick of the stuck-up girls with their snide looks, and sick of the stupid teachers who pretended to be deaf and blind. When the bell went at the end of fourth period, she passed by the canteen, ignoring the pangs from her stomach as the scent of fish and chips wafted through the double doors, and went out of the school gates with the rest of the crowd heading to the chip shop or the bakery. When she came to the end of the line of shops, she just kept on walking.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尽管一节课后衬衣已经干了大半，但恶果已然酿成了。不管她走到哪儿，都会有同年级的男生（有些她甚至都不认识）尾随着她看笑话，说一些风言风语，有的甚至还想去拨一下文胸的带子，看它是不是还在。到吃午餐时，迪伦终于受够了。她讨厌这些不成熟的小男孩对自己的奚落，她讨厌这些目中无人的女生脸上带着嘲讽的神情，她讨厌故意装聋作哑的蠢老师。第四节课的下课铃响之后，她径直走过食堂，完全不管自己正饿得胃痛难忍，而食堂的双扇门中此时正飘来鱼和炸薯条的香味。她走出校门，周围的人群要么去了油炸食品店，要么去了面包房。她走到了整排商店的尽头，仍未停下脚步。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Her heart beat double-time as she reached streets that the pupils never ventured in to at lunchtime -- unless, of course, they were planning to do exactly what she was doing. She'd never skipped school before, had never even considered it really. She was the shy, serious pupil. Quiet, diligent, but not particularly clever. All of her successes had to be earned through hard work, which was easy when you had no friends in any of your classes, or the whole school.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在她走的街道绝没有学生会在午饭时间闯进来，除非他们此时和她有一样的打算。她的心跳加快了。之前她从未逃过课，真的连想都没想过。她性格内向羞涩，做事从来都是一板一眼的。沉静、勤奋，但不是特别聪明。她所有的成绩都是靠努力换来的，如果你在班上乃至整个学校里都没什么朋友，就不愁没有好成绩了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But today she was becoming a rebel. When period five registration was taken, there would be an A for absent beside her name. Even if they phoned Joan at the hospital, there would be nothing she could do about it. By the time her shift finished, Dylan would be halfway to Aberdeen. She put the unease she felt out of her mind. Today she had more important things to think about.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是今天，她决定叛逆一回。第五节课点名的时候，她的名字旁会记上一个A字母代表旷课（Absent）。就算他们给医院里的琼打电话，她也是束手无策、无计可施。到她下班的时候，迪伦到阿伯丁的路已经走完一半了。她把焦虑不安暂时抛到脑后。今天她还有更重要的事要考虑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Trudging up the stairs to the second floor, she pulled out her keys. They jangled loudly in the stairwell, making her catch her breath. The last thing she needed was Mrs Bailey from across the hall sticking her nose out. She'd want to know what Dylan was up to, or worse: she'd want her to come in, have a chat. Catch up. Dylan listened intently, but there was no shuffle of aged footsteps, so she quickly opened up the double lock -- Joan was paranoid about burglars -- and sneaked inside.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她脚步沉重地爬楼梯到二楼，掏出了钥匙。钥匙刺耳的响声在楼梯间回荡，她一下子慌得连大气都不敢喘了。此时她最不希望遇见的就是贝莉夫人。她会从过道把鼻子探出来，然后刨根问底想知道迪伦此时回来意欲何为，如果再糟糕一点，她还会请迪伦进去聊聊，陷进去就出不来了。迪伦仔细听了听，没有老态龙钟慢吞吞的脚步声，于是赶紧打开了双道锁（琼老是很害怕有小偷进来），偷偷溜进屋里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The first thing she did was to yank off the school shirt that had caused all of today's embarrassment. She dumped it in the washing basket in the bathroom and wandered into her room and over to the wardrobe. She stood there examining her clothes closely. What was an appropriate thing to wear when meeting your dad for the first time? It had to make the right initial impression. Nothing revealing that would make her look slutty; nothing with cartoon characters to make her look childish. Something pretty and grown up. She looked left, then right. She pulled some of her clothes aside and leaned in to see what was hidden at the back. Finally she was forced to admit that she did not own anything fitting that description. In the end, she grabbed a faded blue T-shirt with the name of her favourite band emblazoned across the front, and topped this with a grey, hooded zip jumper. She kicked off her school skirt and replaced it with comfortable jeans. Old Nike trainers completed the look.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="进门后第一件事就是把那件让她今天无比尴尬的校服衬衫赶紧脱掉。她把衣服扔进浴室的洗衣筐，然后晃进自己屋里，走到衣橱前。她仔仔细细地检视着自己的衣服。第一次和亲生父亲见面，到底穿什么才得体呢？一定要留下好的第一印象。绝不能穿太暴露的，那样会显得她太轻浮；绝不能穿印着卡通人物的，那会显得她很幼稚。要既漂亮又成熟稳重。她左看看，右瞧瞧，把几件衣服拉到一旁，走近一步想看看里面还有些什么。最后，她不得不承认自己的确没有任何一件衣服符合漂亮、成熟的要求。之后，她抓出来一件有点褪色的蓝色T恤，衣服前面的花纹是她最钟爱的乐队名字，外面套一件灰色带风帽的罩衫。她脱掉校服的裙子，换上舒适的牛仔裤，再加一双旧的耐克跑鞋，打扮完成。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She scrutinised herself in the full-length mirror in Joan's room. It would have to do. Next she grabbed an old bag from the hall cupboard and dumped it on her bed. She shoved in another pair of jeans and a couple of T-shirts, some underwear, and then her black school shoes and a green skirt, just in case he wanted to take her out to dinner or something. Her phone, MP3 player and wallet she stuffed into the front pocket along with some toiletries. Then she grabbed one last, important item from the bed. Egbert. Her teddy. He was greying with age and fairly battered, with one eye missing and a slight tear along the back seam, out of which the stuffing was making a desperate bid to escape. He'd never win a beauty contest, but he'd been with her since she was a baby and having him near her made her feel safe and comforted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她在琼房间里的穿衣镜前仔细打量了自己一番，这样一身行头蛮不错了。接下来她从大厅的壁橱里翻出一个旧包，把它扔在床上。她往里面又放了一条牛仔裤、一打T恤、几件内衣，还有一双平时在学校穿的鞋和一条绿裙子，以便他带她到外面吃饭之类的场合穿。手机、MP3，还有钱包都和化妆品一道塞进了包前面。然后她又从床上抓起最后一件重要物件—艾格伯特，她的泰迪熊。随着时间流逝，它已经变得灰暗、残破，失去了一只眼睛，背后也有轻微的裂缝，里面的填充物纷纷想跑出来。它从来没有赢得过选美比赛，但自从她还是婴儿时它就一直陪伴着她，有它在身边，她感到安全、舒适。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She wanted to take him, but if her dad saw Egbert he'd think she was a baby. She hugged him to her chest, undecided. Then she put him on the bed. She drew back her hand and looked at him. He seemed to stare back, looking unwanted and abandoned. Instantly feeling guilty, Dylan grabbed him and placed him gently on top of her clothes. She zipped up the bag, then half unzipped it and chucked him back out. This time he fell face down and couldn't gaze forlornly at her with his one accusing eye. She zipped up the bag again and walked determinedly out of the room. Egbert lay discarded on the middle of the bed. Exactly twenty seconds later, she dashed back in and grabbed him.</div>

<div class="line_en">If she hurried she might be able to catch the earlier train and surprise her dad. This thought carried her down the stairs and along the street. There was a café en route to the train station; maybe she could nip in, grab a burger to sustain her till dinner. Dylan picked up the pace, mouth already watering in anticipation, but as she passed the high metal gates of the park, something stopped her dead. She stared through the bars at the melee of greenery, not quite sure what she was looking at.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="要是抓紧时间的话，她能赶上较早的那趟车，给她爸爸一个惊喜。她怀着这个想法快步下楼，沿着街道疾行。去车站的路上会经过一个小食店，也许她能飞奔进去，先吃一个汉堡垫垫肚子，然后撑到晚餐。迪伦加快了脚步，一想到食物就忍不住口水直流。然而就在经过公园高高的金属大门时，她突然停了下来。她的目光穿过栅栏，盯在那些恣肆疯长的绿色植物上，其实她也不清楚自己到底在看什么。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She squinted, trying to work out what had triggered the feeling. A glimpse of tousled blond peaked out beneath the branches of a wide oak.
