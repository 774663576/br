<div class="line_cn" title="凯特深深吸了一口气，再一次按下开关。起初一会儿，没有任何动静。接着，监视器上出现了微弱的光点。然后闪了闪，几乎消失。接着，光点又出现了，然后又几乎要消失。光点随后开始越来越亮，直到形成一种持续而稳定的节律。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mallory thought about all the things that had gone wrong -- Kat's roommates coming in just as she was about to go to bed with him, the difficulty of getting together for a date, Kat's being called away by her beeper and leaving him standing naked, her cousin coming to town, her over-sleeping, her period. He stopped suddenly and thought, Wait a minute! They couldn't have all been coincidences! Kat was doing this to him deliberately! She had somehow gotten wind of the bet, and had decided to make a fool of him, to play a joke on him, a joke that was going to cost him ten thousand dollars that he didn't have. The bitch! He was no closer to winning than he had been at the beginning. She had deliberately led him on. How the hell did I let myself get into this? He knew there was no way he could come up with the money.</div>
