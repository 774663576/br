<div class="line_en">Christmas was almost a month away, but at Jess's house the girls were already obsessed with it. This year Ellie and Brenda both had boyfriends at the consolidated high school and the problem of what to give them and what to expect from them was cause of endless speculation and fights.

<div class="line_en">He tried to figure out later what had made him so angry. Partly, of course, it made him furious that anyone as dumb as Brenda would think she could make fun of Leslie. Lord, it hurt his guts to realize that it was Brenda who was his blood sister, and that really, from anyone else's point of view, he and Leslie were not related at all. Maybe, he thought, I was a foundling, like in the stories. Way back when the creek had water in it, I came floating down it in a wicker basket waterproofed with pitch. My dad found me and brought me here because he'd always wanted a son and just had stupid daughters. My real parents and brothers and sisters live far away -- farther away than West Virginia or even Ohio. Somewhere I have a family who have rooms filled with nothing but books and who still grieve for their baby who was stolen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="过后，他试图找出什么让他如此气愤。一部分当然是因为像布兰达这样愚蠢的人竟然认为自己可以嘲弄莱斯利。天啊，想到这是他的亲姐姐更让他觉得心疼，而且从其他任何人的角度来看，他和莱斯利都没有密切的关系。或许，他想，我是一个弃儿，就像故事里的一样。在那个小溪还有水的遥远的时代，我被放在编织防水的柳条篮子里，从上游漂了下来。我爸爸找到了我，因为他一直想要一个儿子，但是却只有一群愚蠢的女儿，所以他把我带到了这里。我真正的父母和兄弟姐妹们住在遥远的地方——比西弗吉尼亚州还远，甚至比俄亥俄州还要远。在某个地方，我有一个家庭，有着整屋整屋的书，并且还在为他们被偷走的儿子感到痛心。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He shook himself back to the source of his anger. He was angry, too, because it would soon be Christmas and he had nothing to give Leslie. It was not that she would expect something expensive; it was that he needed to give her something as much as he needed to eat when he was hungry.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他又把自己拉回了愤怒根源的问题上。他生气的另一个原因是因为圣诞节快要到了，但是他没有什么东西能给莱斯利。这并不是因为她希望得到贵重的礼物，而是他需要送给她一样东西，就像饿了需要吃饭一样地迫切。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">By the last week of school before the holiday, he was growing desperate. There was no one he could ask for help or advice. His dad had told him he would give him a dollar for each member of the family, but even if he cheated on the family presents, there was no way he could get from that enough to buy Leslie anything worth giving her. Besides, May Belle had her heart set on a Barbie doll, and he had already promised to pool his money with Ellie and Brenda for that. Then the price had gone up, and he found he would have to go over into every one else's dollar to make up the full amount for May Belle. Somehow this year May Belle needed something special. She was always moping around. He and Leslie couldn't include her in their activities, but that was hard to explain to someone like May Belle. Why didn't she play with Joyce Ann? He couldn't be expected to entertain her all the time. Still -- still, she ought to have the Barbie.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到放假前的最后一周时，他变的越来越急切。没有人能给他提供帮助或者建议。他爸爸告诉他他会给家里每一人一美元，但即使在家庭礼物上做手脚，他也无法攒下足够的钱给莱斯利买一样对她有价值东西。更何况梅宝看中了一套芭比娃娃，并且他已经答应跟布兰达和艾丽合伙把它买下来。然后涨价了，他发现家里其他人也都必须分担一点才够买梅宝的礼物。无论如何，今年梅宝都需要一个特别的礼物。她总是闷闷不乐。他和莱斯利不能带她一起玩，但向梅宝这种人解释实在太困难了。她为什么不去和乔伊丝·安玩？他不可能随时随刻都逗她开心。总而言之——她应该得到那套芭比娃娃。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He thought about making her a book of his drawings. He even stole paper and crayons from school to do it with. But nothing he drew seemed good enough, and he would end up scrawling across the half-finished page and poking it into the stove to burn up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他曾经想过送她一本他自己画的画。他甚至都已经从学校偷到了蜡笔和纸。然而他画的东西似乎都不够好。他最终只会在半成品上乱涂乱画，然后丢进壁炉里烧掉。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So there was no money, and he seemed paralyzed in his efforts to make anything for Leslie. She wouldn't be like Brenda or Ellie. She wouldn't laugh at him no matter what he gave her. But for his own sake he had to give her something that he could be proud of.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所以他没有钱了，他似乎对于给莱斯利送东西已经无能为力了。她不会像布兰达或艾丽那样。不管他送她什么，她都不会嘲笑他。但是出于他自己的目的，他一定要送她一件自己为之骄傲的东西。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">If he had the money, he'd buy her a TV. One of those tiny Japanese ones that she could keep in her own room without bothering Judy and Bill. It didn't seem fair with all their money that they'd gotten rid of the TV. It wasn't as if Leslie would watch the way Brenda did -- with her mouth open and her eyes bulging like a goldfish, hour after hour. But every once in a while, a person liked to watch. At least if she had one, it would be one less thing for the kids at school to sneer about. But, of course, there was no way that he could buy her a TV. It was pretty stupid of him even to think about it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果他有足够的钱，他会给她买一台电视机。就是那种日本的微型电视机，这样她可以把它放在自己房间里，并不会打扰到朱蒂和比尔。他们有那么多钱却不要一台电视机，这看起来太不公平了。莱斯利才不会像布兰达那样看电视——张着她的嘴，眼球像金鱼一样凸出，整小时整小时的看。她会想看时偶尔看一会儿。至少，如果她有了电视，学校里的孩子们就会少一个嘲笑她的原因。但是，当然，他根本没有办法给她买一台电视。光这么想想就已经够愚蠢的了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Lord, he was stupid. He gazed miserably out the window of the school bus. It was a wonder someone like Leslie would even give him the time of day. It was because there was no one else. If she had found anyone else at that dumb school -- he was so stupid he had almost gone straight past the sign without catching on. But something in a corner of his head clicked, and he jumped up, pushing past Leslie and May Belle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="天啊，他的确是愚蠢。他悲伤的凝视着校车窗外。像莱斯利这种人会愿意整天和他在一起简直就是奇迹了。这是因为没有其他人跟她一起玩。如果她在那垃圾学校找到其他人——他太笨了，差点就错过那个牌子了。但在他脑海的某处豁然开朗，他跳了起来，从莱斯利和梅宝中间挤出去了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jess told Leslie to meet him at the castle stronghold on Christmas Eve afternoon. The rest of his family had gone to the Millsburg Plaza for last-minute shopping, but he stayed behind. The dog was a little brown-and-black thing with great brown eyes. Jess stole a ribbon from Brenda's drawer, and hurried across the field and down the hill with the puppy squirming in his arms. Before he got to the creek bed, it had licked his face raw and sent a stream down his jacket front, but he couldn't be mad. He tucked it tightly under his arm and swung across the creek as gently as he could. He could have walked through the gully. It would have been easier, but he couldn't escape the feeling that one must enter Terabithia only by the prescribed entrance. He couldn't let the puppy break the rules. It might mean bad luck for both of them.</div>

<div class="line_en">"It's really great. Really. I just ain't got the hang of it yet." His face was red, and he kept shoving his hair back out of his eyes as he leaned over the plastic figure-eight track.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“它们真的很好，真的。只是我还没有掌握好而已。”然而他的脸却红了起来。他将身子俯在8字形轨道上，不断地将挡住眼睛的头发向后撩去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jess jumped up, pleased for an excuse to leave the track which he couldn't make work to his dad's satisfaction. His mother seemed not to notice the promptness of his response but went on in a complaining voice, "I don't know what I'd do without Ellie. She's the only one of you kids ever cares whether I live or die." Ellie smiled like a plastic angel first at Jess and then at Brenda, who glared back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杰斯跳了起来，很高兴自己有个借口能离开那轨道——那东西他怎么搞都没法让爸爸满意。妈妈似乎没有注意到杰斯反应之迅速，还在继续抱怨着，“我真不知道没了艾丽我还能干什么。她是你们这帮孩子里唯一关心我死活的人。”艾丽像塑料天使一样微笑起来，先是对着杰斯，后是布兰达，布兰达瞪了回去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Prince Terrien began to snap at Miss Bessie's hooves. She stamped in annoyance. Leslie picked him up, so Jess could milk. The puppy squirmed and licked, making it almost impossible for her to talk. She giggled happily. "Dumb dog," she said proudly.</div>
