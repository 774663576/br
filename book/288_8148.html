<div class="line_en">We agreed that we would row, and not tow, the boat. Harris said that George and I should row, and he would steer. I did not like this idea at all. I said that he and George should row, so that I could rest a little. I thought that I was doing too much of the work on this trip. I was beginning to feel strongly about it.</div>

George said that Harris never did anything except eat and sleep. He, George, had done all the work. He said that he had never met such lazy people as Harris and me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我注意到，无论在哪条船上，每个人都觉得自己把所有的活都干了。哈里斯觉得乔治和我让他干了所有的活。乔治说哈里斯除了睡觉吃饭，什么也没干。只有他——乔治，才真正把什么都包了。他说，从来没有见过象我和哈里斯这么懒的人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We reached Reading at about eleven o'clock. We did not stay long, though, because the river is dirty there. However, after that it becomes very beautiful. Goring, on the left, and Streatley, on the right, are both very pretty places. Earlier, we had decided to go on to Wallingford that day, but the river was lovely at Streatley. We left our boat at the bridge, and we went into the village. we had lunch at a little pub, and Montmorency enjoyed that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="将近十一点钟，我们到了雷丁。我们没在那里久留，因为河水很不干净，然而雷丁以上那一段河上风光就非常可爱了。左边有戈灵，右边是斯特雷特利，都是景致优美的地方。我们本来打算当天赶到沃灵福德，可是斯特雷特利这一带景色使我们流连忘返。我们便在桥边弃舟登岸，走进了这个小村庄，在一个小酒馆吃了午餐，“元帅”在这里也玩得很开心。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We stayed at Streatley for two days, and we took our clothes to be washed. We had tried to wash them ourselves, in the river, and George had told us what to do. This was not a success! Before we washed them, they were very, very dirty, but we could just wear them. After we had washed them, they were worse than before. However, the river between Reading and Henley was cleaner because we had taken all the dirt from it, and we had washed it into our clothes. The woman who washed them at Streatley made us pay three times the usual price.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们在斯特雷特利住了两天，把衣服洗了。这次是我们在河里自己洗的，乔治告诉我们怎么洗，我们就怎么洗。结果是令人不堪回首的失败。没洗之前，我们的衣服已经很脏了，但是还可以对付穿。可是，洗了之后呢，反倒比以前更糟了。不过，从雷丁到亨利的河水一下子更清澈了，因为我们把河里所有污物都收集到一起，洗到我们的衣服里去了。斯特雷特利的洗衣妇管我们要了平常价格的三倍才肯给我们洗。">查看中文翻译</div>

When you go for a walk by the river, the fish come and stand half out of the water, with their mouths open for bread. And if you go swimming, they all come and stare at you and get in your way. But you cannot catch them.</div>
