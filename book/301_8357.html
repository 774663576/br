<div class="line_en">Siddhartha learned something new on every step of his path, for the world was transformed, and his heart was enchanted. He saw the sun rising over the mountains with their forests and setting over the distant beach with its palm-trees. At night, he saw the stars in the sky in their fixed positions and the crescent of the moon floating like a boat in the blue. He saw trees, stars, animals, clouds, rainbows, rocks, herbs, flowers, stream and river, the glistening dew in the bushes in the morning, distant hight mountains which were blue and pale, birds sang and bees, wind silverishly blew through the rice-field. All of this, a thousand-fold and colourful, had always been there, always the sun and the moon had shone, always rivers had roared and bees had buzzed, but in former times all of this had been nothing more to Siddhartha than a fleeting, deceptive veil before his eyes, looked upon in distrust, destined to be penetrated and destroyed by thought, since it was not the essential existence, since this essencelay beyond, on the other side of, the visible. But now, his liberated eyes stayed on this side, he saw and became aware of the visible, sought to be at home in this world, did not search for the true essence, did not aim at a world beyond. Beautiful was this world, looking at it thus, without searching, thus simply, thus childlike. Beautiful were the moon and the stars, beautiful was the stream and the banks, the forest and the rocks, the goat and the gold-beetle, the flower and the butterfly. Beautiful and lovely it was, thus to walk through the world, thus childlike, thus awoken, thus open to what is near, thus without distrust. Differently the sun burnt the head, differently the shade of the forest cooled him down, differently the stream and the cistern, the pumpkin and the banana tasted. Short were the days, short the nights, every hour sped swiftly away like a sail on the sea, and under the sail was a ship full of treasures, full of joy. Siddhartha saw a group of apes moving through the high canopy of theforest, high in the branches, and heard their savage, greedy song. Siddhartha saw a male sheep following a female one and mating with her. In a lake of reeds, he saw the pike hungrily hunting for its dinner; propelling themselves away from it, in fear, wiggling and sparkling, the young fish jumped in droves out of the water; the scent of strength and passion came forcefully out of the hasty eddies of the water, which the pike stirred up, impetuously hunting.</div>

<div class="line_en">On the way, Siddhartha also remembered everything he had experienced in the Garden Jetavana, the teaching he had heard there, the divine Buddha, the farewell from Govinda, the conversation with the exalted one. Again he remembered his own words, he had spoken to the exalted one, every word, and with astonishment he became aware of the fact that there he had said things which he had not really known yet at this time. What he had said to Gotama: his, the Buddha's, treasure and secret was not the teachings, but the unexpressable and not teachable, which he had experienced in the hour of his enlightenment-it was nothing but this very thing which he had now gone to experience, what he now began to experience. Now, he had to experience his self. It is true that he had already known for a long time that his self was Atman, in its essence bearing the same eternal characteristics as Brahman. But never, he had really found this self, because he had wanted to capture it in the net of thought. With the body definitely not being the self, and not the spectacle of the senses, so it also was not the thought, not the rational mind, not the learned wisdom, not the learned ability to draw conclusions and to develop previous thoughts in to new ones. No, this world of thought was also still on this side, and nothing could be achieved by killing the random self of the senses, if the random self of thoughts and learned knowledge was fattened on the other hand. Both, the thoughts as well as the senses, were pretty things, the ultimate meaning was hidden behind both of them, both had to be listened to, both had to be played with, both neither had to be scorned nor overestimated, from both the secret voices of the innermost truth had to be attentively perceived. He wanted to strive for nothing, except for what the voice commanded him to strive for, dwell on nothing, except where the voice would advise him to do so. Why had Gotama, at that time, in the hour of all hours, sat down under the bo-tree, where the enlightenment hit him? He hadheard a voice, a voice in his own heart, which had commanded him to seek rest under this tree, and he had neither preferred self-castigation, offerings, ablutions, nor prayer, neither food nor drink, neither sleep nor dream, he had obeyed the voice. To obey like this, not to an external command, only to the voice, to be ready like this, this was good, this was necessary, nothing else was necessary.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="席特哈尔塔在路上又想起了他在耶塔瓦纳林苑经历的一切，想起他在那儿听过的教诲，想起活佛，想起他与戈文达的分别，想起他与活佛的谈话。他回忆自己当时对活佛讲过的话，回忆每一句话，惊讶地注意到自己居然讲了当时他还根本不知道的事。他对戈塔马所说的一切——他的事，活佛的事，珍贵和秘密的并不是学问，而是他在茅塞顿开时体验到的无可言传和难以讲授的东西——这也正是他现在准备经历的东西，他现在开始经历的东西。现在他必须体验自我。他早就清楚他的自我就是阿特曼，像婆罗门一样具有永恒的性质。可是，他从来没有真正找到过这个自我，因为原来他是想用思想之网去捕获它。如果说身体不是自我，本义的游戏不是自我，那么，思想也不是自我。要想得出结论并且从已经思考过的东西推出新想法，理性不行，学到的智慧不行，学到的技巧也不行。不，这个思想世界也还是尘世的，如果扼杀这个偶然的感觉的自我，却去喂肥那个偶然的思想和学问的自我，那是不会达到什么目标的。思想和感觉，这两者都是可爱的事物，这两者后面都潜藏着最后的意识，两者都值得倾听，都值得打交道，既不可轻视也不可高估，应当从这两者来了解内心深处的稳秘声音。他只想追求这个声音命令他追求的东西，他只想在这个声音建议他停留的地方停留。当初，在他豁然开朗的时候，戈塔马为什么是坐在菩提树下？当时他听见了一个声音，自己心中的一个声音，吩咐他在这棵树下歇息，他没有先进行苦修、祭祀、沐浴或祈祷，没吃也没喝，没睡觉也没做梦，而是听从了这个声音。他就这么服从了，不是服从外来的命令，而是服从这个声音，心甘情愿地服从。这是对的，是必要的，是必不可少的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In the night when he slept in the straw hut of a ferryman by the river, Siddhartha had a dream: Govinda was standing in front of him, dressed in the yellow robe of an ascetic. Sad was how Govinda looked like, sadly he asked: Why have you forsaken me? At this, he embraced Govinda, wrapped his arms around him, and as he was pulling him close to his chest and kissed him, it was not Govinda any more, but a woman, and a full breast popped out of the woman's dress, at which Siddhartha lay and drank, sweetly and strongly tasted the milk from this breast. It tasted of woman and man, of sun and forest, of animal and flower, of every fruit, of every joyful desire. It intoxicated him and rendered him unconscious. -- When Siddhartha woke up, the pale river shimmered through the door of the hut, and in the forest, a dark call of an owl resounded deeply and pleasantly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="夜里，席特哈尔塔睡在河边一个船夫的茅草屋里，做了一个梦：戈文达站在他面前，穿着一件黄僧衣。戈文达的样子很伤心，他伤心地问：“你为什么离开我？”于是他拥抱戈文达，伸出两臂搂住他，把他紧贴在自己胸前，亲吻他。谁知这时不再是戈文达了，变成了一个女人，从这个女人的衣裳里露出一个丰满的乳房，席特哈乐塔凑到乳房上吸吮，乳汁又甜又香。那是女人和男人的味道，太阳和森林的味道，动物和鲜花的味道，各种果实的味道，各种乐趣的味道。它使人陶醉，醉得不省人事。——当席特哈尔塔醒来时，灰白的河水透过茅屋的小门闪着微光，树林里响起猫头鹰的一声神秘啼叫，深沉而又响亮。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At about noon, he came through a village. In front of the mud cottages, children were rolling about in the street, were playing with pumpkin-seeds and sea-shells, screamed and wrestled, but they all timidly fled from the unknown Samana. In the end of the village, the path led through a stream, and by the side of the stream, a young woman was kneeling and washing clothes. When Siddhartha greeted her, she lifted her head and looked up to him with a smile, so that he saw the white in her eyes glistening. He called out a blessing to her, as it is the custom among travellers, and asked how far he still had to go to reach the large city. Then she got up and came to him, beautifully her wet mouth was shimmering in her young face. She exchanged humorous banter with him, asked whether he had eaten already, and whether it was true that the Samanas slept alone in the forest at night and were not allowed to have any women with them. While talking, she put her left foot on his right one and made a movement as a woman doeswho would want to initiate that kind of sexual pleasure with a man, which the textbooks call "climbing a tree". Siddhartha felt his blood heating up, and since in this moment he had to think of his dream again, he bend slightly down to the woman and kissed with his lips the brown nipple of her breast. Looking up, he saw her face smiling full of lust and her eyes, with contracted pupils, begging with desire.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="中午时，他来到一个村庄。巷子里，孩子们在土墙小屋前打滚，玩南瓜子和贝壳，叫嚷和打闹，可是一看见这个陌生的沙门就全都吓跑了。在村尾，道路穿过一条小溪，一个年轻女人正跪在溪边洗衣服。席特哈尔塔向她问好，她抬起头，含笑瞥了他一眼，这时，他看到她眼睛里的白色在闪亮。他按照行路人通常的方式打过招呼，便问到大城去还有多远。她直起身，走过来，年轻的脸上那张湿润的嘴十分动人。她跟他开玩笑，问他吃过饭没有，问沙门夜间独宿在树林里，身边不许有女人，这是不是真的。她边说边把她的左搁在他的右脚上，做了个动作，就像女人挑逗男人作出爱抚动作时那样，教科书通常称之为“爬树”。席特哈尔塔感觉到自己的血变热了，因为这时他又想起了他的梦，他朝那女人微微弯下腰，用嘴唇亲吻她的乳房那深褐色的乳头。他看到她仰着脸满怀欲念地微笑，眯细的眼睛在渴望地恳求。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Siddhartha also felt desire and felt the source of his sexuality moving; but since he had never touched a woman before, he hesitated for a moment, while his hands were already prepared to reach out for her. And in this moment he heard, shuddering with awe, the voice if his innermost self, and this voice said No. Then, all charms disappeared from the young woman's smiling face, he no longer saw anything else but the damp glance of a female animal in heat. Politely, he petted her cheek, turned away from her and disappeared away from the disappointed woman with light steps into the bamboo-wood.</div>

<div class="line_en">Before the city, in a beautifully fenced grove, the traveller came across a small group of servants, both male and female, carrying baskets. In their midst, carried by four servants in an ornamental sedan-chair, sat a woman, the mistress, on red pillows under a colourful canopy. Siddhartha stopped at the entrance to the pleasure-garden and watched the parade, saw the servants, the maids, the baskets, saw the sedan-chair and saw the lady in it. Under black hair, which made to tower high on her head, he saw a very fair, very delicate, very smart face, a brightly red mouth, like a freshly cracked fig, eyebrows which were well tended and painted in a high arch, smart and watchful dark eyes, a clear, tall neck rising from a green and golden garment, resting fair hands, long and thin, with wide golden bracelets over the wrists.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Perhaps it is so," she said quietly, "as you say, friend. But perhaps it is also like this: that Siddhartha is a handsome man, that his glance pleases the women, that therefore good fortune is coming towards him."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“也许是这样，”她低声说，“就像你说的，朋友。大概因为席特哈尔塔是个英俊的男子，女人都喜欢他的目光，所以他才总是碰上好运气吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You were willing. Look, Kamala: When you throw a rock into the water, it will speed on the fastest course to the bottom of the water. This is how it is when Siddhartha has a goal, a resolution. Siddhartha does nothing, he waits, he thinks, he fasts, but he passes through the things of the world like a rock through water, without doing anything, without stirring; he is drawn, he lets himself fall. His goal attracts him, because he doesn't let anything enter his soul which might oppose the goal. This is what Siddhartha has learned among the Samanas. This is what fools call magic and of which they think it would be effected by means of the daemons. Nothing is effected by daemons, there are no daemons. Everyone can perform magic, everyone can reach his goals, if he is able to think, if he is able to wait, if he is able to fast."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你不是愿意了嘛！瞧，卡玛拉，如果你把一块石头扔进水里，它会顺着最快的途径沉下水底。假如席特哈尔塔有了一个目标，下了一个决心，那么情况也是如此。席特哈尔塔并不做什么，他只是等待，他思考，可是他穿过世上万物就像石头穿过水，用不着做什么，用不着动弹，他径直被拽过去，沉下去。他的目标把他吸引过去，因为他不让任何可能违背他目标的东西进入他的心。这就是席特哈尔塔向沙门学到的本领，这就是傻瓜们称之为魔法并认为是魔鬼在起作用的东西。没有什么是魔鬼的神道，压根儿就没有魔鬼！每个人都会魔法，每个人都能达到他的目标，只要他会思考，会等待，会斋戒。”">查看中文翻译</div>
