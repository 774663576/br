<div class="line_en">Inconspicuous as he was, however, he managed to take hold of the biggest potato of the lot -- the very same one that several people in the line had been watching. They all looked on as a thirteen-year-old fist rose up and grabbed it. A choir of heavyset Helgas pointed him out, and Thomas Mamer came storming toward the dirty fruit.</div>

<div class="line_en">He didn't stop going right away, purely to show Deutscher that he wasn't afraid of him, but after another few weeks, Rudy ceased his involvement altogether.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他没有立即逃避，这只是为了做给道伊彻看，证明他不是因为害怕道伊彻才缺席的。可是几个星期后，鲁迪便再也不参加活动了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Instead of attending the Hitler Youth, they walked out of town and along the Amper, skipping stones, heaving enormous rocks into the water, and generally getting up to no good. He made sure to get the uniform dirty enough to fool his mother, at least until the first letter arrived. That was when he heard the dreaded call from the kitchen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们不再参加希特勒青年团的集会，而是走出小镇，沿着安珀河一路闲逛。他们踩着石子，将巨大的石块推入水中，就这样整天无所事事。他一定要把衣服弄得够脏，至少要在青年团的第一封信寄来前骗过妈妈。那封信寄到的时候，他听到厨房里传来可怕的呼唤声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They begged him to go. He refused.</div>

<div class="line_en">Eventually, it was the opportunity to join a different division that swayed Rudy in the right direction. This was fortunate, because if he didn't show his face soon, the Steiners would be fined for his non-attendance. His older brother, Kurt, inquired as to whether Rudy might join the Flieger Division, which specialized in the teaching of aircraft and flying. Mostly, they built model airplanes, and there was no Franz Deutscher. Rudy accepted, and Tommy also joined. It was the one time in his life that his idiotic behavior delivered beneficial results.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到最后，组织给鲁迪一个机会，让他换到另一个分部，才终于令他步入“正轨”。谢天谢地，要是他继续缺席，施泰纳一家就要因此被罚款了。他哥哥库尔特前去询问，能不能让鲁迪加入专门教授飞机与飞行知识的航空分部。他们基本上只造得出飞机模型，但那里至少没有弗朗茨·道伊彻。鲁迪应允下来，汤米也随之加入那个分部。在他这一生中，唯独这一件蠢事带来了良好的结果。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dressed proudly in his uniform, he exited Himmel Street and kept walking, his loyal subject, Tommy, by his side.</div>

<div class="line_en">In his new division, whenever he was asked the famous Fuhrer question, Rudy would smile and answer, "April 20, 1889," and then to Tommy, he'd whisper a different date, like Beethoven's birthday, or Mozart's, or Strauss's. They'd been learning about composers in school, where despite his obvious stupidity, Rudy excelled.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在新分部里，但凡被问及那个大名鼎鼎的关于元首的问题，鲁迪都会微笑着回答：“一八八九年四月二十日。”然后，他会悄声告诉汤米一个不同的日期，比方说贝多芬的生日、莫扎特的生日，或是施特劳斯的生日。他们在学校里学过这些作曲家的生平，鲁迪虽然是个大笨蛋，却在这方面成绩优异。">查看中文翻译</div>
