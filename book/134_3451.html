<div class="line_en">The page she had written last night, Therese thought, had nothing to do with this Carol, was not addressed to her. I feel I am in love with you, she had written, and it should be spring. I want the sun throbbing on my head like chords of music. I think of a sun like Beethoven, a wind like Debussy, and birdcalls like Stravinsky. But the tempo is all mine.</div>

<div class="line_en">"The cream's in here, ma'am," she said, pointing to a pitcher that didn't match the demitasse set. Florence glanced at Therese with a friendly smile and round blank eyes. She was about fifty, with a bun at the back of her neck under the starched white band of her cap. Therese could not establish her somehow, could not determine her allegiance. Therese had heard her refer to Mr. Aird twice as if she were very devoted to him, and whether it was professional or genuine, Therese did not know.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“夫人，奶油在这里。”她指着一个大壶，看起来和小咖啡杯并不相称。佛罗伦斯用友善的微笑和空洞的圆眼望着特芮丝，她年约四十，脖子后面梳着发髻，头上则是浆好的白色帽带。不知出于什么原因，特芮丝觉得佛罗伦斯这个人的底细深不可测，她的忠诚度也无法判定。特芮丝听过她提到爱尔德先生两次，好像还在为他效忠。特芮丝不清楚这到底只是职业上的特性，还是发自内心地依旧效忠着旧主。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Carol poked her with the back of her toe. "Hop up."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡罗尔用脚指头戳了戳她。“跳起来。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But Therese was slow to move, and Carol swung her feet over Therese's head and sat up. Then Therese heard the maid's step in the next room, and the plump, Irish-looking maid in the gray and white uniform came in bearing a coffee tray, shaking the porch floor with her quick, eager little steps that sounded so eager to please.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过特芮丝的动作不够快，所以卡罗尔反而抢先一步，把脚越过特芮丝的头上坐了起来。接着特芮丝听到隔壁房间女佣的脚步声，那个看上去像爱尔兰人的胖女佣穿着灰白色的制服，拿着咖啡托盘进来。她快速、积极的小碎步撼动着阳台地板，声音听起来就是亟欲讨好的感觉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Will there be anything else, ma'am?" Florence asked. "Shall I put out the lights?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“夫人，还有什么其他事吩咐吗？”佛罗伦斯问，“把灯熄掉好吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“对，”卡罗尔说，“怎么了？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Carol was motionless for a moment, and then she reached for a cigarette, a last one, and crumpled the pack up. "I was thinking, in fact, you might like to go with me. What do you think, for three weeks or so?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡罗尔一动也不动，这个姿势维持了好一会儿，然后她才伸手去拿盒子里的最后一根烟，还把烟盒压扁成一团。“其实我在想，你想不想跟我一起去。大概去三个礼拜，你觉得怎么样？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“没有。”特芮丝说。艾比没有明说，但更糟糕的是话底下的弦外之音。她感觉到卡罗尔的手离开了她的肩膀。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Carol knew that, and knew she would have to refuse if Carol asked her in this way. Therese felt suddenly sure that Carol taunted her, and she resented it with the bitter resentment of a betrayal. And the resentment resolved itself into a decision never to see Carol again. She glanced at Carol, who was waiting for her answer, with that defiance only half masked by an air of indifference, an expression that Therese knew would not change at all if she should give a negative answer. Therese got up and went to the box on the end table for a cigarette. There was nothing in the box but some phonograph needles and a photograph.</div>

<div class="line_en">"No. Because of something that happened in the lawyer's office. That was the afternoon Harge's lawyer wanted to see us both, and Harge had brought Rindy, too. Rindy said she wanted to go to Harge's house for Christmas. Rindy didn't know I wasn't going to be there this year. They have a big tree that grows on the lawn and they always decorate it, so Rindy was set on it. Anyway, it made quite an impression on the lawyer, you know, the child asking to go home for Christmas with her father. And naturally I didn't want to tell Rindy then I wasn't going, or she'd have been disappointed. I couldn't have said it anyway, in front of the lawyer. Harge's machinations are enough."</div>

<div class="line_en">Carol shrugged. "It's Harge's lawyer, not mine. So I agreed to the three-month arrangement now, because I don't want her to be tossed back and forth. If I'm to have her nine months and Harge three -- it might as well start now."</div>

"Harge doesn't make it easy for you to see her, does he?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"I've never done anything to embarrass him socially, and that's all he cares about really. There's a certain woman at the club I wish he'd married. Her life is entirely filled with giving exquisite little dinner parties and being carried out of the best bars feet first -- She's made her husband's advertising business a great success, so he smiles on her little faults. Harge wouldn't smile, but he'd have some definite reason for complaint. I think he picked me out like a rug for his living room, and he made a bad mistake. I doubt if he's capable of loving anyone, really. What he has is a kind of acquisitiveness, which isn't much separate from his ambition. It's getting to be a disease, isn't it, not being able to love?" She looked at Therese. "Maybe it's the times. If one wanted to, one could make out a case for racial suicide. Man trying to catch up with his own destructive machines."</div>

<div class="line_en">Therese said nothing. It reminded her of a thousand conversations with Richard, Richard mingling war and big business and Congressional witch-hunts and finally certain people he knew into one grand enemy, whose only collective label was hate. Now Carol, too. It shook Therese in the profoundest part of her where no words were, no easy words like death or dying or killing. Those words were somehow future, and this was present. An inarticulate anxiety, a desire to know, know anything, for certain, had jammed itself in her throat so for a moment she felt she could hardly breathe. Do you think, do you think, it began. Do you think both of us will die violently someday, be suddenly shut off? But even that question wasn't definite enough. Perhaps it was a statement after all: I don't want to die yet without knowing you. Do you feel the same way, Carol? She could have uttered the last question, but she could not have said all that went before it.</div>
