<div class="line_en">Not many children could say they remembered the day they met their father, but Vittoria Vetra could. She was eight years old, living where she always had, Orfanotrofio di Siena, a Catholic orphanage near Florence, deserted by parents she never knew. It was raining that day. The nuns had called for her twice to come to dinner, but as always she pretended not to hear. She lay outside in the courtyard, staring up at the raindrops… feeling them hit her body… trying to guess where one would land next. The nuns called again, threatening that pneumonia might make an insufferably headstrong child a lot less curious about nature.</div>

<div class="line_en">The young priest was Leonardo Vetra. Although he had been an award-winning physics student while in university, he'd heard another call and gone into the seminary. Leonardo and Vittoria became unlikely best friends in the lonely world of nuns and regulations. Vittoria made Leonardo laugh, and he took her under his wing, teaching her that beautiful things like rainbows and the rivers had many explanations. He told her about light, planets, stars, and all of nature through the eyes of both God and science. Vittoria's innate intellect and curiosity made her a captivating student. Leonardo protected her like a daughter.</div>

<div class="line_en">As she moved down the LHC tunnel toward her father's lab, Vittoria realized she was about to unveil her father's greatest achievement without him there. She had pictured this moment much differently. She had imagined her father calling CERN's top scientists to his lab, showing them his discovery, watching their awestruck faces. Then he would beam with fatherly pride as he explained to them how it had been one of Vittoria's ideas that had helped him make the project a reality… that his daughter had been integral in his breakthrough.

<div class="line_en">The entry to Leonardo Vetra's lab was a long sterile hallway paved entirely in white tile. Langdon felt like he was entering some kind of underground insane asylum. Lining the corridor were dozens of framed, black-and-white images. Although Langdon had made a career of studying images, these were entirely alien to him. They looked like chaotic negatives of random streaks and spirals. Modern art? he mused. Jackson Pollock on amphetamines?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="通往李欧纳度．威特拉研究室入口的，是一条乾净而空荡的长走廊，地上全铺上了白色瓷砖。兰登觉得自己好像走进了什麽地下精神病院。走廊上贴了十来张裱框的黑白图像。虽然兰登的职业是研究图像，但这些图片在他眼中却是完全陌生的。看起来像是一堆乱七八糟的条纹和螺旋的负片。现代艺术吗？他思索著。杰克森．帕洛克（Jackson Pollock）咳了安非他命？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Scatter plots," Vittoria said, apparently noting Langdon's interest. "Computer representations of particle collisions. That's the Z-particle," she said, pointing to a faint track that was almost invisible in the confusion. "My father discovered it five years ago. Pure energy -- no mass at all. It may well be the smallest building block in nature. Matter is nothing but trapped energy."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="「散佈图。」薇多利雅说，显然注意到兰登对这些感兴趣。「粒子相撞的电脑图像。这是Z粒子。」她说，指著那团混乱中一条几乎看不见的模糊轨迹，「我父亲五年前发现的。纯能量──完全没有质量。很可能是自然界最小的组成元素。物质只不过是被陷阱困住的能量罢了。」">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Even as a child, Vittoria had disliked the man. Although she eventually came to respect his potent intellect, his icy demeanor always seemed inhuman, the exact antithesis of her father's warmth. Kohler pursued science for its immaculate logic… her father for its spiritual wonder. And yet oddly there had always seemed to be an unspoken respect between the two men. Genius, someone had once explained to her, accepts genius unconditionally.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="薇多利雅小时候就不喜欢这个人。虽然她终究尊敬他不凡的才智，但他冷冰冰的模样总看似不近人情，跟他父亲的温暖恰成对比。寇勒从事科学研究，是为了其中完美的逻辑……她父亲则是因为科学展现的精神奇观。但奇怪的是，这两个人对彼此总是有种无言的敬意。有人曾跟她解释，天才绝对是彼此惺惺相惜的。">查看中文翻译</div>
