<div class="line_en">Finally God fulfilled her desires, but when the child came to the world it did not look like a human child, but instead it was a young donkey. When the mother saw it she wept and wailed. She would sooner have no child at all than a donkey, and she said that they should throw it into the water and let the fish eat it.</div>

<div class="line_en">Thus they raised the little donkey. He got bigger, and his ears grew up straight and tall. He was a very cheerful sort, jumped about, and played. He was especially fond of music, so he went to a famous minstrel and said, "Teach me to play the lute as well as you do."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就这样，这驴子被养了下来，慢慢长大了，它的耳朵又细又长，向上直伸着。这驴儿天性活泼，到处跳跃、游戏，且特别爱好音乐。於是他走到一位有名的乐师那里，说“把你的本领教给我吧，我要把琴弹得和你一样好。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, my little master," answered the minstrel, "that will be difficult for you, because you don't have quite the right fingers; they are too large. And I am afraid that the strings would not hold up."</div>

<div class="line_en">One day while taking a contemplative walk he came to a well, looked into it, and saw his donkey shape in the mirror-like water. This made him so sad that he set forth into the wide world, taking only a single loyal companion with him. They went this way and that way, finally coming to a kingdom where an old king ruled. He had only one daughter, but she was very beautiful.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有一次，这小主人出去散步，脑子正在思考着甚么，不觉来到了一口井边。他往水中一瞧，见水面清澈如镜，那儿有自己的驴子模样。他懊丧极了，便带了忠实的仆人离家出走，到了很远的地方。他们四处漂泊，最后来到了一个王国，统治这个国家的是位年迈的国王，不过他有一位美丽绝伦的独身女。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That opened the gatekeeper's eyes, and he ran to the king, saying, "A little donkey is sitting outside the gate playing the lute as good as an accomplished master."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="守城门的人听得睁大了眼，赶忙跑去报告国王：“门外坐着头驴子，琴儿弹得有大师那么棒。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But no excuse would do. The little donkey insisted on learning to play the lute. He kept at it and practiced hard, and in the end he learned to play just as well as his teacher.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但他的推脱没用，驴儿要弹琴，非学弹琴不可。他学起来又勤快、又刻苦，最后练得竟和师傅一样好了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The little donkey said, "This is where we will stay." He knocked at the gate and called out, "There is a guest out here. Open up and let him in." But they did not open the gate, so he took his lute and began to play it most beautifully with his two front feet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="驴儿说：“我们就在这儿呆下吧！”说着就去敲城门，“外边有客，快开门让他进来！”有人说但是大门没有打开。他於是坐了下来，取出他的琴，伸出两只前腿弹起琴来，音乐非常优美动听。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So they had a large and splendid wedding. That evening when the bride and the bridegroom were led into their bedroom, the king wanted to know if the little donkey would behave himself like a gentleman, so he had a servant hide himself there. When the couple was inside, the bridegroom bolted the door shut, looked around, and thinking that they were all alone, he pulled off his donkey skin and stood there as a handsome young man of royalty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="於是他们举行了隆重而豪华的婚礼。新婚之夜，新郎和新娘被带进了洞房，国王想知道驴儿是不是举止温文尔雅，便命一个仆人躲在那里。他们双双走进了新房，新郎闩上了门，他以为只有他们俩在那里，只见他摔脱了身上的皮，站在那儿，竟是个英俊潇洒的青年。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Your advice is good," said the king, and that evening while they slept, he crept into their room, and when he came to their bed, by the light of the moon he saw a proud young man lying there. The skin was lying on the floor. He took it away, had an enormous fire built outside, and had the skin thrown into it. He himself stayed there until it had burned entirely to ashes. He stayed awake and kept watch the entire night, because he wanted to see what the robbed man would do.
