<div class="line_en">Jack carried Danny into the kitchen. The boy was still sobbing wildly, refusing to look up from Jack's chest. In the kitchen he gave Danny back to Wendy, who still seemed stunned and disbelieving.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I do believe it," he said, although he had to admit to himself that it gave him a certain amount of pleasure to see the shoe switched to the other foot with such dazzling, unexpected speed: But his anger at Wendy had been only a passing gut twitch. In his heart he knew Wendy would pour a can of gasoline over herself and strike a match before harming Danny.</div>

<div class="line_en">She pointed, and Jack took one of the bottles down. He poured a hefty dollop into the teacup, put the sherry back, and filled the last quarter of the cup with milk. Then he added three tablespoons of sugar and stirred. He brought it to Danny, whose sobs had tapered off to snifflings and hitchings. But he was trembling all over, and his eyes were wide and starey.</div>

<div class="line_en">Danny nodded that he could and took the cup. He drank a little, grimaced, and looked questioningly at Jack. Jack nodded and Danny drank again. Wendy felt the familiar twist of jealousy somewhere in her middle, knowing the boy would not have drunk it for her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="丹尼点点头，接过杯子尝了尝，随后撅起了嘴巴，满眼疑问地望着杰克。杰克向他点了点头，丹尼又喝了起来。温迪知道儿子是不会为她喝下这东西的，心中不由得生出了那种并不陌生的妒意。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Want you to drink this, doc," Jack said. "It's going to taste frigging awful, but it'll make you feel better. Can you drink it for your daddy?"</div>

<div class="line_en">On the heels of that came an uncomfortable, even startling thought: Had she wanted to think Jack was to blame? Was she that jealous? It was the way her mother would have thought, that was the really horrible thing. She could remember a Sunday when her Dad had taken her to the park and she had toppled from the second tier of the jungle gym, cutting both knees. When her father brought her home, her mother had shrieked at him: What did you do? Why weren't you watching her? What kind of a father are you?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接踵而来的是一个让人感到不舒服的，甚至惊人的想法：她原本就想认为杰克该受到责备，是这样的吗？她有这么忌妒吗？这完全是她母亲的思维方式，太可怕了！她记得，有个星期天，她爸爸带她去公园，她在游乐场跌了一跤，两只膝盖都划破了。父亲把她带回家时，母亲对他尖声嚷道：你干什么去了？你怎么没好好看着她？你是怎么当爸爸的？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It took Danny fifteen minutes to drink half of the big cup's contents, and by that time he had calmed visibly. The shakes were almost gone.</div>

<div class="line_en">Danny looked from Jack to Wendy, then back again. In the silent pause, their setting and situation made themselves known: the whoop of the wind outside, driving fresh snow down from the northwest; the creaking and groaning of the old hotel as it settled into another storm. The fact of their disconnect came to Wendy with unexpected force as it sometimes did, like a blow under the heart.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="丹尼的目光从杰克移到温迪，然后又回到杰克身上。就在这短暂的沉默期间，周围的环境和他们的处境都在竞相证明自身的存在：狂风在楼外呼啸，夹裹着来自西北方的新雪；老饭店在又一场暴风雪中呻吟不已。他们与世隔绝的事实时不时带着意想不到的威力震荡着温迪的心扉。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“是骗子吗？”丹尼问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yeah, crooks." He looked at Wendy. "In 1966 a big-time hood named Vito Gienelli got killed up there, along with his two bodyguards. There was a picture in the newspaper. Danny just described the picture."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“对，骗子。”他看着温迪。“1966年，一个名叫维多·吉埃内利的黑社会头目和他的两个保镖在这里被刺杀了。报纸上有一张照片，丹尼刚才说的就是那张照片上的东西。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"This place," Jack said. "Some pretty bad types owned it awhile back. Organization people from Las Vegas."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这家饭店，”杰克说。“不久以前属于一帮很坏的家伙。拉斯维加斯黑帮。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Mr. Hallorann said he saw some other stuff," Danny told them. "Once about the playground. And once it was something bad in that room. 217. A maid saw it and lost her job because she talked about it. So Mr. Hallorann went up and he saw it too. But he didn't talk about it because he didn't want to lose his job. Except he told me never to go in there. But I did. Because I believed him when he said the things you saw here couldn't hurt you." This last was nearly whispered in a low, husky voice, and Danny touched the puffed circle of bruises on his neck.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哈洛伦先生说他还看到过别的东西，”丹尼告诉他们。“一次在游乐场，一次在217房间。有个女服务员看见了那个东西，她说了出来，所以她被解雇了。后来哈洛伦先生又去了那个房间，他也看见了，但没说出来，因为他不想丢掉工作。他告诉我千万不要到那里去，可是我去了，因为他说，‘这些东西不会伤害你，我相信了。”说到最后一句话的时候，他的喉咙哽噎了，声音小得几乎听不见，他摸了摸脖子上青肿的伤痕。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Danny was looking at him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="丹尼看着他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Nothing," he said again, more calmly. And that was true. He had been the victim of an hallucination. And that was all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“什么都没看见，”他又说，稍稍镇静了一些。确实如此，他只不过产生过幻觉，仅此而已。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Danny, we have to hear about the woman," Wendy said gently.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“丹尼，给我们讲讲那个女人。”温迪柔声说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No," he said. "Nothing."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没有，”他说。“没有。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I went in," he said. "I stole the passkey and went in. It was like I couldn't help myself. I had to know. And she… the lady… was in the tub. She was dead. All swelled up. She was nuh-nuh… didn't have no clothes on." He looked miserably at his mother. "And she started to get up and she wanted me. I know she did because I could feel it. She wasn't even thinking, not the way you and Daddy think. It was black… it was hurt-think… like… like the wasps that night in my room! Only wanting to hurt. Like the wasps."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我进去了，”他说。“我偷来了万能钥匙，进去了。我控制不住自己，我一定要知道。她…那个女人…躺在浴缸里。她死了，肿得圆鼓鼓的。她没没…没穿衣服。”他可怜巴巴地望着妈妈。“她站起来抓我。我知道她想要我，我能感觉到。她脑子里什么都没想，不像你和爸爸那样总在想着什么。黑…伤害…想…像…像那天晚上我房间里的大黄蜂！她只想来掐我，像大黄蜂一样。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So Danny told them, but his words came in cyclic bursts, sometimes almost verging on incomprehensible garble in his hurry to spit it out and be free of it. He pushed tighter and tighter against his mother's breasts as he talked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是，丹尼开始讲起来，但他的话又急促又零碎，有时为了尽快吐出来并摆脱它而变成了近于不可理解的只言片语。讲话的时候，他紧紧地偎在妈妈的胸脯上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"So I ran," Danny said. "I ran but the door was closed. I left it open but it was closed. I didn't think about just opening it again and running out. I was scared.

<div class="line_en">He swallowed and there was silence for a moment, all quiet while the image of the wasps sank into them.</div>
