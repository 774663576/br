<div class="line_en">Appearances in the Valley are paramount and for three years Theranos had been operating on the wrong side of the tracks. The "tracks" in this case were Route 101, otherwise known as the Bayshore Freeway. It separates Palo Alto, one of the most affluent towns in America, from its poorer sibling East Palo Alto, which once held the dubious distinction of being the country's murder capital.</div>

<div class="line_en">The company's old office was on the East Palo Alto side of the four-lane highway, next to a machine shop and across the street from a roofing contractor. It wasn't the type of neighborhood wealthy venture capitalists liked to be seen in. The new address, by contrast, was right next to the Stanford campus and around the corner from Hewlett-Packard's plush headquarters. It was pricey real estate that signaled Theranos was graduating to the big leagues.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="Theranos旧址位于四线道国道的东帕罗奥图一侧，隔壁是间机械工厂，对街是屋顶整修包商，富裕的创投金主不会喜欢被人看到自己走进这种地方。相反地，新址座落于斯坦福校园隔壁，惠普（Hewlett-Packard）豪华总部就在不远处，位处高价地段，代表Theranos升上了大联盟。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But at four that afternoon, Matt got pulled into a conference room with Michael Esquivel and Gary Frenzel. Elizabeth was conferenced in by phone from Switzerland, where she was conducting a second demonstration for Novartis some fourteen months after the faked one that had led to Henry Mosley's departure. She'd just learned that the landlord would charge them rent for the month of February if they didn't clear the premises by midnight. There was no way she was going to let that happen, she said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是到了下午四点，麦特被拉进会议室，麦可．艾斯基维和盖瑞．法兰佐也在里面，伊莉莎白从瑞士打电话来跟他们开会（她去向诺华进行第二次展示，距离造成亨利．莫斯利离开的第一次造假展示，已相隔十四个月），她刚刚得知，如果午夜之前没有清理干净，房东会收取二月份的租金，她说她绝对不允许这种事发生。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Planning the move had taken up a big chunk of Matt's time over the past several months. On Thursday, January 31, 2008, everything finally seemed ready. The movers were scheduled to arrive first thing the next morning to haul everything away.</div>

<div class="line_en">The move was not fun for the person who had to make it happen, however. That job fell to Matt Bissel, the head of IT. Bissel was one of Elizabeth's most trusted lieutenants. He'd joined Theranos in 2005 as employee number 17 and took his duties seriously. In addition to being responsible for the company's IT infrastructure, his role also included security. He was the one who'd done the forensic analysis of the computer evidence for the Michael O'Connell lawsuit.</div>

<div class="line_en">Elizabeth was undeterred. She told Matt to call another moving company she had once used and to give them the job. Unlike the first company, this one wasn't unionized. She was sure it would be more flexible. But when Matt called the second moving company and explained the situation, a person there strongly advised him to drop the idea. Unionized moving companies were all mob controlled, the person said. What Theranos was proposing to do risked devolving into violence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="伊莉莎白不死心，她要麦特打电话给她以前用过的搬家公司，请他们来搬。跟第一家公司不同，这家没有加入工会，伊莉莎白认为会比较有弹性。不过麦特打电话给第二家公司时，对方强烈建议他放弃这个念头。对方说，有加入工会的搬家公司都掌控在黑道手里，Theranos这么做有可能招惹上暴力。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She instructed Matt to call the moving company and have the movers come immediately. Matt thought the odds that would happen were very low but agreed to try. He stepped out of the conference room and made the call. The moving company's dispatcher laughed at him. No sir, rescheduling a corporate move at the eleventh hour wasn't possible, he was told.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她指示麦特打电话给搬家公司，请搬家工人马上来搬。麦特觉得可能性很低，不过同意试试。他走出会议室打电话，搬家公司的调度人员笑说，先生，不行，十一个小时前才重新安排搬迁时间是不可能的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Even after hearing that sobering answer, Elizabeth wouldn't let it go. Matt and Gary tried to reason with her by citing other obstacles. Gary raised the issue of their stockpile of blood samples. Supposing they managed to get a crew to come that day; the movers wouldn't unload everything at the new address until tomorrow, he pointed out. How would they keep the blood at the proper temperature in the meantime? Elizabeth said they could use refrigerated trucks and keep them running in the parking lot overnight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就算听到这么严正的忠告，伊莉莎白还是不肯罢休。麦特和盖瑞举出其他窒碍难行之处，试图说之以理。盖瑞提出他们那一大堆血液样本的问题，他指出，就算真的找到人搬家，也要等到第二天才能把所有东西卸到新址，在这之前要怎么将血液样本保存在适当温度下？伊莉莎白说可以利用冷藏货车，把车停在停车场过夜，不熄火。">查看中文翻译</div>

</div>
<div class="line_en">In the end, the move took place the next day as originally planned, but the episode was the final straw for Matt. Part of him admired Elizabeth. She was one of the smartest people he'd ever met and she could be a really inspiring and energizing leader. He often joked that she could sell ice cream to Eskimos. But another part of him was tiring of her unpredictability and the constant chaos at the company.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后还是按照原定计划在隔天搬家，不过这段插曲成了压垮麦特的最后一根稻草。他很佩服伊莉莎白，她是他见过最聪明的人之一，也是能激励人、鼓舞人的领导者。他常开玩笑说，她能卖冰淇淋给爱斯基摩人。不过，他同时对她的不可预测，以及公司连续不断的混乱感到厌烦。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After several crazed hours, Matt was finally able to talk some sense into her by pointing out that even if they somehow cleared the building by 11:59 p. m. that night, they would still have to conduct walkthroughs with state officials to demonstrate that they had properly disposed of any hazardous materials. Theranos was a biotech company, after all. Those walkthroughs would take weeks to schedule and no new tenant would be able to move in until they had occurred.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="鬼打墙几个小时后，麦特终于成功说服她理性思考。他点出，就算午夜十一点五十九分前把大楼清空，还是得会同州政府官员全部巡一遍，证明他们有好好处理危险物品，毕竟Theranos是生物科技公司，而整个过程的安排需要花几周时间，没完成之前新房客无法搬进来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One aspect of Matt's job had become increasingly distasteful to him. Elizabeth demanded absolute loyalty from her employees and if she sensed that she no longer had it from someone, she could turn on them in a flash. In Matt's two and a half years at Theranos, he had seen her fire some thirty people, not counting the twenty or so employees who lost their jobs at the same time as Ed Ku when the microfluidic platform was abandoned.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="麦特对自己某部分的工作也愈来愈反感。伊莉莎白要求员工绝对忠诚，要是她从某人身上感受不到忠诚，她会立刻翻脸攻击。麦特在Theranos两年半以来，已经看过她开除三十个人左右，这还不包括放弃微流控技术时，连同艾德蒙．古一起裁掉的二十几个人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was one case in particular that Matt regretted helping her with: that of Henry Mosley, the former chief financial officer. After Elizabeth fired Mosley, Matt had stumbled across inappropriate sexual material on his work laptop as he was transferring its files to a central server for safekeeping. When Elizabeth found out about it, she used it to claim it was the cause of Mosley's termination and to deny him stock options.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="麦特尤其后悔帮她做过一件事，跟前任财务长亨利．莫斯利有关。伊莉莎白开除莫斯利之后，麦特要将他笔电里的文件转移到中央服务器保管时，无意中发现一些不该存在的色情内容，伊莉莎白一得知，便对外宣称莫斯利就是因此遭到解雇，并以此为由拒绝履行莫斯利的认股权。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Every time Elizabeth fired someone, Matt had to assist with terminating the employee. Sometimes, that meant more than just revoking the departing employee's access to the corporate network and escorting him or her out of the building. In some instances, she asked him to build a dossier on the person that she could use for leverage.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="每次伊莉莎白开除人，麦特就得从旁助刀。有时不只是将临走同事的公司网络切断、把人押送出大楼，她甚至会要求他把那个人的数据汇整成文件，以便她可以「好好利用」。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Matt had reported to Mosley until he left and thought he'd done an excellent job of helping Elizabeth raise money for Theranos. He clearly shouldn't have browsed porn on a work-issued laptop, but Matt didn't think it was a capital offense that merited blackmailing him. And besides, it had been found after the fact. Saying it was the reason Mosley was fired simply wasn't true.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莫斯利离开前一直是麦特的顶头上司，麦特认为他十分称职地协助伊莉莎白募到很多资金。没错，他确实不该用公司笔电看色情内容，但是麦特觉得罪不致死，不该以此做为要胁。更何况，那是事后才发现的，硬说是莫斯利被解雇的理由，有违事实。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The way John Howard was treated also bothered him. When Matt reviewed all the evidence assembled for the Michael O'Connell lawsuit, he didn't see anything proving that Howard had done anything wrong. He'd had contact with O'Connell but he'd declined to join his company. Yet Elizabeth insisted on connecting the dots a certain way and suing him too, even though Howard had been one of the first people to help her when she dropped out of Stanford, letting her use the basement of his house in Saratoga for experiments in the company's early days. (Theranos later dropped the case against its three ex-employees when O'Connell agreed to sign his patent over to the company.)</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此外，约翰．郝尔德受到的对待也令麦特不安。麦特把所有控告麦可．欧康诺的证据细看了一遍，看不出郝尔德有任何做错之处。郝尔德确实一直跟欧康诺有联系，但他婉拒加入欧康诺的公司，可是伊莉莎白却坚持把这些串连起来，一口咬定他，把他也告进去，完全不顾念郝尔德是她从斯坦福辍学时最早帮助她的人之一：当时公司刚成立，郝尔德大方出借家里地下室给她做为实验室之用（Theranos后来撤销对三位前员工的告诉，因为欧康诺签字同意将他的专利权转让给Theranos）。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Matt had long wanted to start his own IT consulting firm and he decided this was the time to walk away and do it. When he informed Elizabeth of his decision, she looked at him in utter disbelief. She couldn't comprehend how he could possibly trade in a job at a company that was going to revolutionize health care and change the world for that. She tried to entice him to stay with a raise and a promotion, but he turned her down.</div>

<div class="line_en">Theranos's new office in Palo Alto was nice, but it was actually too big for a startup that had just shrunk back down to fifty people after the Ed Ku layoffs. The main floor was a long rectangular expanse. Elizabeth insisted on clustering employees on one side of it, leaving a big empty stretch of space on the other. Once or twice, Aaron Moore tried to put it to use by coaxing several colleagues into a game of indoor soccer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="位于帕罗奥图的新办公室相当不错，不过，对于一家刚裁掉艾德蒙．古等人而缩水到五十人的新创公司，实在太大了。办公室一楼是狭长的长方形空间，伊莉莎白坚持把员工集中在一边，另一边因而显得又大又空旷。亚伦．摩尔曾善用这个空间一、二次，怂恿同事一起踢室内足球。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">During his last couple of weeks at Theranos, what Matt had seen happen to numerous other employees started happening to him. Elizabeth wouldn't speak to him anymore or even look at him. She offered one of his IT colleagues, Ed Ruiz, his position if Ed agreed to dig through Matt's files and emails. But Ed was good friends with Matt and refused. In any case, there was nothing to find. Matt was squeaky-clean. Unlike Henry Mosley, he was able to keep his stock options and to exercise them. He left Theranos in February 2008 and started his own firm. Ed Ruiz joined him a few months later.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="待在Theranos最后那几周，过去许许多多同事面临的事开始降临在麦特身上。伊莉莎白不再跟他讲话，连正眼都不瞧。她要麦特的同事艾德．卢乙斯（Ed Ruiz）填补麦特的遗缺，前提是艾德必须答应把麦特的文件和电邮好好挖个彻底，但是身为麦特好友的艾德拒绝了。就算要挖，也不会有任何发现的，麦特非常净身自爱。麦特跟亨利．莫斯利的下场不同，他保住也行使了认股权。二〇〇八年二月，他离开Theranos去创业，几个月后艾德．卢乙斯加入他的公司。">查看中文翻译</div>

She'd just marched out one day and hadn't come back. It unsettled Justin the most because Ana was the one who'd talked him into leaving Apple to come to Theranos, but he tried to maintain a positive attitude.

<div class="line_en">With Tony's permission, they put the Edisons in the trunk of Aaron's Mazda and drove up to San Francisco. Their plan was to take them around to friends' startups in the city. First, they stopped at Aaron's apartment in San Francisco's Mission District to do some staging. They placed the machines on the wooden coffee table in Aaron's living room and made sure they had everything else they needed: the cartridges, the lancets to draw the blood, and the small syringes called "transfer pens" used to put the blood in the cartridge.</div>

<div class="line_en">Shortly after the move, Aaron and Mike decided to conduct some informal "human factors" research with two of the Edison prototypes Tony Nugent and Dave Nelson had built. It was engineering-speak for putting them in people's hands and seeing how they interacted with them. Aaron was curious to know how people handled pricking their fingers and the subsequent steps required to get the blood into the cartridge. He'd pricked his own finger so much while running internal tests that he no longer had any feeling in it.</div>

<div class="line_en">As the day progressed, it became apparent that one pinprick often wasn't enough to get the job done. Transferring the blood to the cartridge wasn't the easiest of procedures. The person had to swab his finger with alcohol, prick it with the lancet, apply the transfer pen to the blood that bubbled up from the finger to aspirate it, and then press on the transfer pen's plunger to expel the blood into the cartridge. Few people got it right on their first try. Aaron and Mike kept having to ask their test subjects to prick themselves multiple times. It got messy. There was blood everywhere.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一整天下来愈看愈清楚，只扎一次手指通常不够，把血液转移到卡匣也不是最简单的部分。受试者必须先用酒精擦拭手指，接着扎入刺血针，再用「转移笔」把手指冒出的血吸进笔里，然后按压笔上的柱塞，把血滴进卡匣里。很少人一次就做对，亚伦和麦克必须请受试者扎好几次才行，现场搞得乱七八糟，到处血迹斑斑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Aaron took photos with his digital camera to document what they were doing. The Yves Béhar cases weren't ready yet, so the devices had a primitive look. Their temporary cases were made from gray aluminum plates bolted together. The front plate tilted upward like a cat door to let the cartridge in. A rudimentary software interface sat atop the cat door at an angle. Inside, the robotic arm made loud, grinding sounds. Sometimes, it would crash against the cartridge and the pipette tips would snap off. The overall impression was that of an eighth-grade science project.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="亚伦用数字相机把他们做的事一一记录下来。亦夫．毕哈设计的外壳还没完成，所以外观仍很原始，暂时替代的外壳是用灰色铝板拼接而成，正面铝板像猫门一样可往上倾斜，以便卡匣插入，一个简陋的软件接口歪歪斜斜放在猫门上。壳子里面的机器手臂发出巨大摩擦声响，有时还会撞击卡匣，吸量管尖头会啪一声断掉，给人感觉这是八年级学生的自然劳作。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Aaron was getting frustrated and disillusioned. He'd initially bought into Elizabeth's vision and found work at Theranos exciting. But after nearly two years, he was getting burned out. Among other issues, he didn't get along with Tony, who'd become his boss. To get out from under him, he had asked to transfer from engineering to sales. He'd even spent a recent Saturday driving around shopping for a suit in the hope that Elizabeth would let him tag along on her trip to Switzerland. She didn't, but she seemed to at least be taking his transfer request under advisement.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="亚伦愈来愈失望、幻灭。一开始他很相信伊莉莎白的愿景，觉得在Theranos工作是很兴奋的事，但是将近两年过去，他的热情已经不再。跟东尼处不来是原因之一，东尼是他的上司，为了脱离东尼麾下，他请求从工程部门调到销售部门，最近一个周六他甚至开车去逛街买西装，为的就是希望伊莉莎白让他一同前往瑞士（向诺华展示），结果并没有，不过至少她似乎开始认真考虑他的请调。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">These difficulties confirmed what Aaron already suspected: the company was underestimating this part of the process. To assume that a fifty-five-year-old patient in his or her home was going to immediately master it was wishful thinking. And if you didn't get this part right, it didn't matter how well the rest of the system functioned; you weren't going to get good results. When they got back to the office, Aaron passed on his findings to Tony and Elizabeth, but he could tell they didn't think they were a priority.</div>

Before joining Theranos, he had worked at several established companies, including most recently the German enterprise software juggernaut SAP. He was fit and good-looking, wore nice suits, and rolled up every day in a fancy BMW. During lunchtime, he pulled a carbon fiber road bike out of his trunk and went on rides in the nearby hills.

<div class="line_en">A move to sales would probably have been ill-advised anyway. Unbeknownst to Aaron, trouble was brewing in that corner of the company. A new employee named Todd Surdey had come on board to head up sales and marketing, a role previously played by Elizabeth herself.</div>

<div class="line_en">Todd's two sales subordinates were based on the East Coast, where all the big pharmaceutical companies were headquartered. One of them was Susan DiGiaimo, an employee who operated out of her home in New Jersey and had worked for Theranos for nearly two years. Susan had accompanied Elizabeth on numerous sales pitches to drugmakers and had listened uncomfortably as she promised them the moon. When the drugmakers' executives asked if the Theranos system could be customized to suit their needs, Elizabeth would always answer, "Absolutely."</div>

<div class="line_en">Moreover, no significant revenues would materialize unless Theranos proved to each partner that its blood system worked. To that effect, each deal provided for an initial tryout, a so-called validation phase.

<div class="line_cn" title="而且，除非Theranos向每家合作药厂证明它的血液系统可行，不然是不会有大笔营收进帐的。为此，每笔交易都订有一个初步试验，就是所谓的「验证期」，只要药厂不满意试验结果便会掉头走人，交易随之告吹。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In March 2008, Todd and Michael approached Tom Brodeen, one of Theranos's board members, and told him the revenue projections Elizabeth was touting to the board weren't grounded in reality.

It was an impressive performance, he thought. A much older and more experienced CEO skilled in the art of corporate infighting would have been hard-pressed to turn the situation around like she had. He was reminded of an old saying: "When you strike at the king, you must kill him." Todd Surdey and Michael Esquivel had struck at the king, or rather the queen. But she'd survived.</div>

Tony, who was under a lot of pressure from Elizabeth, finally had enough of hearing Aaron's complaints and asked him to leave the company. "Go find a place where you can be a big fish in a small pond," he told him.</div>

<div class="line_en">Aaron agreed that it was time for him to go. To his surprise, Elizabeth tried to convince him to stay. It turned out she thought highly of him despite his prank. But his mind was made up. He resigned in June 2008. Mike Bauerly followed in December. Every member of the Apple contingent had now moved on, marking the end of a chaotic period for the company. Elizabeth had survived an aborted board coup and was back firmly in control. Remaining Theranos employees looked forward to calmer and quieter times. But their hopes would soon be dashed.</div>
