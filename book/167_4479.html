<div class="line_en">The gold cloaks were almost as uncertain a weapon. Six thousand men in the City Watch, thanks to Cersei, but only a quarter of them could be relied upon. "There's few out-and-out traitors, though there's some, even your spider hasn't found them all," Bywater had warned him. "But there's hundreds greener than spring grass, men who joined for bread and ale and safety. No man likes to look craven in the sight of his fellows, so they'll fight brave enough at the start, when it's all warhorns and blowing banners. But if the battle looks to be going sour they'll break, and they'll break bad. The first man to throw down his spear and run will have a thousand more trodding on his heels."</div>

<div class="line_en">He still had Bronn's hirelings, near eight hundred of them now, but sellswords were notoriously fickle. Tyrion had done what he could to buy their continued loyalty, promising Bronn and a dozen of his best men lands and knighthoods when the battle was won. They'd drunk his wine, laughed at his jests, and called each other ser until they were all staggering… all but Bronn himself, who'd only smiled that insolent dark smile of his and afterward said, "They'll kill for that knighthood, but don't ever think they'll die for it."</div>

<div class="line_en">Bronn and the escort were waiting at the foot of the quay, amidst swarming beggars, strolling whores, and fishwives crying the catch. The fishwives did more business than all the rest combined. Buyers flocked around the barrels and stalls to haggle over winkles, clams, and river pike. With no other food coming into the city, the price of fish was ten times what it had been before the war, and still rising. Those who had coin came to the riverfront each morning and each evening, in hopes of bringing home an eel or a pot of red crabs; those who did not slipped between the stalls hoping to steal, or stood gaunt and forlorn beneath the walls.</div>

<div class="line_en">To be sure, there were seasoned men in the City Watch, the core of two thousand who'd gotten their gold cloaks from Robert, not Cersei. Yet even those… a watchman was not truly a soldier, Lord Tywin Lannister had been fond of saying. Of knights and squires and men-atarms, Tyrion had no more than three hundred. Soon enough, he must test the truth of another of his father's sayings: One man on a wall was worth ten beneath it.</div>

<div class="line_en">He called Bronn to his side. "Assemble a hundred men and burn everything you see here between the water's edge and the city walls." He waved his stubby fingers, taking in all the waterfront squalor. "I want nothing left standing, do you understand?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他把波隆叫到身边。“组织一百人，烧掉从河边到城墙之间所有的东西。”他挥挥粗短的手指，将肮脏贫穷的码头区整个圈进去。“一干二净，视野内不准任何东西矗立，明白吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The gold cloaks cleared a path through the press, shoving people aside with the shafts of their spears. Tyrion ignored the muttered curses as best he could. A fish came sailing out of the crowd, slimy and rotten. It landed at his feet and flew to pieces. He stepped over it gingerly and climbed into his saddle. Children with swollen bellies were already fighting over pieces of the stinking fish.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="金袍卫士用矛杆推开群众，在人潮里清出一条路。提利昂尽力不去在意那些嘀咕和咒骂。一条腐烂而滑腻的鱼从人群中飞出，落在他脚边，裂成碎片。他小心翼翼地跨过它，爬上马背。身后，肚腹鼓胀的孩子们已为臭鱼的碎片厮打起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mounted, he gazed along the riverfront. Hammers rang in the morning air as carpenters swarmed over the Mud Gate, extending wooden hoardings from the battlements. Those were coming well. He was a deal less pleased by the clutter of ramshackle structures that had been allowed to grow up behind the quays, attaching themselves to the city walls like barnacles on the hull of a ship; bait shacks and pot-shops, warehouses, merchants' stalls, alehouses, the cribs where the cheaper sort of whores spread their legs. It has to go, every bit of it. As it was, Stannis would hardly need scaling ladders to storm the walls.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他骑马望向河岸。清晨的空气中锤声激荡，大批木匠群聚烂泥门，为城垛加添木板。进展不错。但另一方面，码头后方滋生的那堆摇摇欲坠的建筑，又令他相当不快。它们紧贴城墙，活像附在船身上的贝壳，其中有鱼饵仓、食堂、仓库、商铺、酒馆，以及便宜娼妓的勾栏。必须清空，半点不留。有了这些，史坦尼斯连搭云梯的工夫都省了。">查看中文翻译</div>

Not as grotesquely huge as Harrenhal, nor as solid and impregnable to look at as Storm's End, yet there had been a great strength in those stones, a sense that within those walls a man might feel safe. The news of the castle's fall had come as a wrenching shock. "The gods give with one hand and take with the other," he muttered under his breath when Varys told him.

<div class="line_en">Tyrion had only the vaguest memory of Theon Greyjoy from his time with the Starks. A callow youth, always smiling, skilled with a bow; it was hard to imagine him as Lord of Winterfell. The Lord of Winterfell would always be a Stark.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对席恩·葛雷乔伊，在作客北境的短短时间，提利昂只有极模糊的记忆。他是个乳臭未干的小子，很爱笑，擅用弓；很难想像他竟成了临冬城主。临冬城主一直都是史塔克啊。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He remembered their godswood; the tall sentinels armored in their grey-green needles, the great oaks, the hawthorn and ash and soldier pines, and at the center the heart tree standing like some pale giant frozen in time. He could almost smell the place, earthy and brooding, the smell of centuries, and he remembered how dark the wood had been even by day. That wood was Winterfell. It was the north. I never felt so out of place as I did when I walked there, so much an unwelcome intruder. He wondered if the Greyjoys would feel it too. The castle might well be theirs, but never that godswood. Not in a year, or ten, or fifty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他想起他们的神木林：高大的哨兵树以灰绿的松针作铠甲，还有大橡树、山楂树、铁树、岑树及士卒松。心树挺立于核心，好似冻结在时光之中的白巨人。他仿佛还能闻到那里沉静的乡土气息，那种酝酿千年的味道，那片树林纵然白天亦是阴暗。那片树林就是临冬城。那片树林就是北境。当我在林间行走，从未有过的格格不入感油然而生，仿佛自己就是一个不受欢迎的闯入者。不知葛雷乔伊家的人会不会有同感。城堡也许由他们掌控，但那片神木林绝不会。一年不会，十年不会，再过五十年仍不可能。">查看中文翻译</div>

The gate was open. Inside, three great trebuchets stood side by side in the market square, peering over the battlements like three huge birds. Their throwing arms were made from the trunks of old oaks, and banded with iron to keep them from splitting.

<div class="line_en">By the time he rid himself of them, bells were ringing and Tyrion knew he would be late for the installation. He waddled across the yard almost at a run and crowded into the back of the castle sept as Joffrey fastened white silk cloaks about the shoulders of the two newest members of his Kingsguard. The rite seemed to require that everyone stand, so Tyrion saw nothing but a wall of courtly arses.

Pleading illness, Lord Gulian Swann had remained in his castle, taking no part in the war, but his eldest son had ridden with Renly and now Stannis, while Balon, the younger, served at King's Landing. If he'd had a third son, Tyrion suspected he'd be off with Robb Stark. It was not perhaps the most honorable course, but it showed good sense; whoever won the iron Throne, the Swarms intended to survive. In addition to being well born, young Ser Balon was valiant, courtly, and skilled at arms; good with a lance, better with a morningstar, superb with the bow.

<div class="line_en">He supposed he ought not complain. The appointment gave him another ear close to the king, unbeknownst to his sister. And even if Ser Osmund proved an utter craven, he would be no worse than Ser Boros Blount, currently residing in a dungeon at Rosby. Ser Boros had been escorting Tommen and Lord Gyles when Ser Jacelyn Bywater and his gold cloaks had surprised them, and had yielded up his charge with an alacrity that would have enraged old Ser Barristan Selmy as much as it did Cersei; a knight of the Kingsguard was supposed to die in defense of the king and royal family.

<div class="line_en">Alas, Tyrion could not say the same for Cersei's second choice. Ser Osmund Kettleblack looked formidable enough. He stood six feet and six inches, most of it sinew and muscle, and his hook nose, bushy eyebrows, and spade-shaped brown beard gave his face a fierce aspect, so long as he did not smile. Lowborn, no more than a hedge knight, Kettleblack was utterly dependent on Cersei for his advancement, which was doubtless why she'd picked him. "Ser Osmund is as loyal as he is brave," she'd told Joffrey when she put forward his name. It was true, unfortunately. The good Ser Osmund had been selling her secrets to Bronn since the day she'd hired him, but Tyrion could scarcely tell her that.</div>

<div class="line_en">Loath as he was to disappoint her, Tyrion had to point out that while Lady Tanda was by no means a clever woman, even she might wonder if her daughter's bedmaid seemed to own more jewelry than her daughter. "Choose two or three dresses, no more," he commanded her. "Good wool, no silk, no samite, and no fur. The rest I'll keep in my own chambers for when you visit me." It was not the answer Shae had wanted, but at least she was safe.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="提利昂耸肩。“谁知道？史坦尼斯烧毁了风息堡的神木林，作为向‘光之王’的献礼。他既已冒犯旧神，为何放过新神？就这么向他们布道，告诉他们：协助篡夺者不仅是背叛合法的国王，同时也是背弃正道诸神。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When the investiture was finally done Joffrey marched out between Ser Balon and Ser Osmund in their new white cloaks, while Tyrion lingered for a word with the new High Septon (who was his choice, and wise enough to know who put the honey on his bread).

<div class="line_en">Hallyne the Pyromancer was waiting on him when Tyrion returned to his solar, and Maester Frenken had brought messages. He let the alchemist wait a little longer while he read what the ravens had brought him. There was an old letter from Doran Martell, warning him that Storm's End had fallen, and a much more intriguing one from Balon Greyjoy on Pyke, who styled himself King of the isles and the North. He invited King Joffrey to send an envoy to the Iron Islands to fix the borders between their realms and discuss a possible alliance.</div>

<div class="line_en">Only then did he admit Hallyne with the latest tallies from the alchemists. "This cannot be true," said Tyrion as he pored over the ledgers. "Almost thirteen thousand jars? Do you take me for a fool? I'm not about to pay the king's gold for empty jars and pots of sewage sealed with wax, I warn you."</div>

<div class="line_en">Tyrion read the letter three times and set it aside. Lord Balon's longships would have been a great help against the fleet sailing up from Storm's End, but they were thousands of leagues away on the wrong side of Westeros, and Tyrion was far from certain that he wanted to give away half the realm.

Some whores have been using the ruins to entertain their patrons, and one of them fell through a patch of rotted floor into a cellar. When he felt the jars, he mistook them for wine.

<div class="line_en">"There was a prince who tried that once," said Tyrion dryly. "I haven't seen any dragons rising over the city, so it would seem it didn't work this time either." The Dragonpit atop the hill of Rhaenys had been abandoned for a century and a half. He supposed it was as good a place as any to store wildfire, and better than most, but it would have been nice if the late Lord Rossart had told someone. "Three hundred jars, you say? That still does not account for these totals. You are several thousand jars ahead of the best estimate you gave me when last we met."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“从前有个王子也这么做，”提利昂冷淡地说，“城里没有飞龙，看来这次也无效。”雷妮丝丘陵顶的龙穴已荒废一个半世纪，想来要存放野火，那里比较合适，但他还是希望已故的罗萨特大人将这个消息早点公布。“你说三百罐？三百罐也无法解释这个总数，这比上次见面时你告诉我的最高估计还多出几千罐。”">查看中文翻译</div>
