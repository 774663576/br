<div class="line_en">Until now, the Colony had gone its way without any form of interference from the Overlords. They had left it completely alone, as indeed they ignored most human activities that were not subversive or did not offend their codes of behaviour. Whether the Colony's aims could be called subversive was uncertain. They were non-political, but they represented a bid for intellectual and artistic independence. And from that, who knew what might come? The Overlords might well be able to foresee the future of Athens more clearly than its founders -- and they might not like it.</div>

<div class="line_en">Karellen's request, though it might have been expected at any time since the foundation of the Colony, was something of a bombshell. It represented, as everyone was fully aware, a crisis in the affairs of Athens, and nobody could decide whether good or bad would come of it.</div>

<div class="line_en">Of course, if Karellen wished to send an observer, inspector, or whatever one cared to call him, there was nothing that could be done about it. Twenty years ago the Overlords had announced that they had discontinued all use of their surveillance devices, so that humanity need no longer consider itself spied upon. However, the fact that such devices still existed meant that nothing could be hidden from the Overlords if they really wanted to see it.</div>

<div class="line_en">The current chairman of the council was the philosopher, Charles Yan Sen, an ironic but fundamentally cheerful man who was not yet in his sixties and was therefore still in the prime of life. Plato would have approved of him as an example of the philosopher-statesman, though Sen did not altogether approve of Plato, whom he suspected of grossly misrepresenting Socrates. He was one of the islanders who was determined to make the most of this visit, if only to show the Overlords that men still had plenty of initiative and were not yet, as he put it, "fully domesticated".</div>

<div class="line_en">All these matters were debated endlessly while the preparations were under way. Nothing was known of the visiting Overlord, but it was assumed that he could absorb culture in unlimited amounts. The experiment would at least be attempted, and the reactions of the victim observed with interest by a battery of very shrewd minds.</div>

<div class="line_en">There were some on the island who welcomed this visit as a chance of settling one of the minor problems of Overlord psychology -- their attitude towards Art.

In that case, was the purpose of this visit purely esthetic, or did Karellen have less innocent motives?</div>

<div class="line_en">Nothing in Athens was done without a committee, that ultimate hallmark of the democratic method. Indeed, someone had once defined the Colony as a system of interlocking committees. But the system worked, thanks to the patient studies of the social psychologists who had been the real founders of Athens. Because the community was not too large, everyone in it could take some part in its running and could be a citizen in the truest sense of the word.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was almost inevitable that George, as a leading member of the artistic hierarchy, should be one of the reception committee. But he made doubly sure by pulling a few strings. If the Overlords wanted to study the Colony, George wanted equally to study them. Jean was not very happy about this. Ever since that evening at the Boyces', she had felt a vague hostility towards the Overlords, though she could never give any reason for it. She just wished to have as little to do with them as possible, and to her one of the island's main attractions had been its hoped-for independence. Now she feared that this independence might be threatened.</div>

<div class="line_en">After the first day, the islanders ceased to pay much attention when the official car murmured past on its sightseeing tours. The visitor's correct name, Thanthalteresco, proved too intractable, for general use, and he was soon christened "The Inspector". It was an accurate enough name, for his curiosity and appetite for statistics were insatiable.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Overlord arrived without ceremony in an ordinary manmade flyer, to the disappointment of those who had hoped for something more spectacular. He might have been Karellen himself, for no one had ever been able to distinguish one Overlord from another with any degree of confidence. They all seemed duplicates from a single master-mould. Perhaps, by some unknown biological process, they were.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mrs. Sen greeted her husband anxiously on his return. They were a devoted couple, despite his playful habit of calling her Xantippe when they were entertaining guests. She had long ago threatened to make the appropriate retort by brewing him a cup of hemlock, but fortunately this herbal beverage was less common to New Athens than the old.</div>

Luckily I had Secretary Harrison with me, and he'd come prepared with every Annual Report since the Colony began. You should have heard them swapping statistics. The Inspector's borrowed the lot, and I'm prepared to bet that when we see him tomorrow he'll be able to quote any figure back at us. I find that kind of mental performance frightfully depressing."

<div class="line_en">That was not a question that Charles Sen was ever to have answered, but on other points the Inspector was remarkably talkative. He would evade awkward queries in a manner that was a pleasure to behold, and then, quite unexpectedly, would become positively confiding. Their first real intimacy occurred while they were driving away from the school that was one of the Colony's chief prides. "It's a great responsibility," Dr. Sen had remarked, "training these young minds for the future. Fortunately, human beings are extraordinarily resilient: it takes a pretty bad upbringing to do permanent damage. Even if our aims are mistaken, our little victims will probably get over it. And as you've seen, they appear to be perfectly happy." He paused for a moment, then glanced mischievously up at the towering figure of his passenger. The Inspector was completely clothed in some reflecting silvery cloth so that not an inch of his body was exposed to the fierce sunlight. Behind the dark glasses, Dr. Sen was aware of the great eyes watching him emotionlessly -- or with emotions which he could never understand. "Our problem in bringing up these children must, I imagine, be very similar to yours when confronted with the human race. Wouldn't you agree?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="检查员似乎很乐意谈其他问题，但没有回答这一个。对那些刁钻的问题他态度友好地避而不答，但突然间又会变得意想不到地坦率。离开这个城市最引以为自豪的学校，在车上，森博士终于有了机会和检查员私下交谈：“我们的一项重大责任就是为未来培养年轻人。人有很强的灵活性，只有真正糟糕透顶的教育才会给孩子带去终身伤害。即使我们的目标是错的，孩子们也能克服。你都看见了，他们都很快乐。”说到这里，森博士不再往下说，别有用心地仰望着这位身材高大的检查员，由于害怕强烈的阳光，检查员用一件反光的银色衣服把全身裹得严严实实，墨镜后面那双大眼睛毫无表情地看着自己，也许有感情，只是人们无法察觉。“你看，你们处理人类事物时所遇到的问题是不是和我们培养孩子过程中出现的问题一样？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"In some ways," admitted the Overlord gravely. "In others, perhaps a better analogy can be found in the history of your colonial powers. The Roman and British Empires, for that reason, have always been of considerable interest to us. The case of India is particularly instructive. The main difference between us and the British in India was that they had no real motives for going there -- no conscious objectives, that is, except such trivial and temporary ones as trade or hostility to other European powers. They found themselves possessors of an Empire before they knew what to do with it, and were never really happy until they had got rid of it again."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“有些方面是，”外星人认真地承认，“有些方面不是。这个可以拿你们的殖民时期作类比。由于某些原因，我们对罗马帝国和大英帝国很感兴趣，英国人在印度的情况就很有启发意义。我们和那些英国人相比，最主要的区别是他们到印度去没有一个明确目的，只有些贸易以及和其他欧洲国家的矛盾等暂时性问题。他们不清楚自己为什么要去那儿。他们发现自己拥有这样一个帝国，却茫然不知所措，只有等到放弃这个帝国，他们才能真正快乐。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Here," he continued, "we do not suffer from the ancient obsession that leisure is wicked. But we do not consider that it is enough to be passive receptors of entertainment. Everybody on this island has one ambition, which may be summed up very simply. It is to do something, however small it may be, better than anyone else. Of course, it's an ideal we don't all achieve. But in this modern world the great thing is to have an ideal. Achieving it is considerably less important."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“在这儿，”他接着介绍，“闲暇不再有罪，我们不相信那一套老观点，但如果只是被动地接受各种娱乐活动，还远远不够。我们岛上的每个人都有雄心，简单地说，这个雄心就是不管做一件什么事，也不管这事是多么小，都要立志比别人做得好——当然不是所有的人都能实现自己的抱负，但最关键的是要有志向，能不能实现相比之下反而不那么重要。”">查看中文翻译</div>

The Dean wondered if they were physiologically necessary, or whether they were merely camouflage. Certainly they made quite impossible the already difficult task of reading the Overlord's thoughts. He did not, however, seem to object to the some- what challenging statements that had been thrown at him, or the criticisms of his race's policy with regard to Earth which they implied.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Inspector came through the symphony concert with flying colours, which was a good deal more than could be said for many human members of the audience. The only concession to popular taste had been Stravinsky's "Symphony of Psalms": the rest of the programme was aggressively modernistic. Whatever one's views on its merits, the performance was superb, for the Colony's boast that it possessed some of the finest musicians in the world was no idle one. There had been much wrangling among the various rival composers for the honour of being included in the programme, though a few cynics wondered if it would be an honour at all. For all that anyone knew to the contrary, the Overlords might be tone deaf. It was observed, however, that after the concert Thanthalteresco sought out the three composers who had been present, and complimented them all on what he called their "great ingenuity". This caused them to retire with pleased but vaguely baffled expressions.</div>

The theatre had arranged a kind of mixed grill rather than a single dish -- two one-act plays, a sketch by a world-famous impersonator, and a ballet sequence. Once again all these items were superbly executed and one critic's prediction --"Now at least we'll discover if the Overlords can yawn"-- was falsified.

<div class="line_en">His bad temper lasted two days. The Inspector's flyer had departed, amid many protestations of mutual regard, before the sequel emerged. No one had thought of questioning Jeff, and the boy must have been thinking it over for a long time before he approached George.</div>

<div class="line_en">When Jeff was safely out of the way, and Jenny had been attended to, Jean came back and sat on the rug beside George's chair, leaning against his legs. It was a habit that struck him as annoyingly sentimental, but not worth creating a fuss about. He merely made his knees as knobbly as possible.</div>

<div class="line_en">"It happened," George replied, "but perhaps we're foolish to worry. After all, most parents would be grateful -- and of course, I am grateful. The explanation may be perfectly simple. We know that the Overlords have got interested in the Colony, so they've undoubtedly been observing it with their instruments -- despite that promise they made. Suppose one was just prowling round with that viewing gadget of theirs, and saw the wave coming. It would be natural enough to warn anyone who was in danger."</div>

<div class="line_en">George looked down at her with sympathy, but nothing more. It was strange how much one could alter in so short a time. He was fond of her: she had borne his children and was part of his life. But of the love which a not-clearly-remembered person named George Greggson had once known towards a fading dream called Jean Morrel, how much remained? His love was divided now between Jeff and Jennifer on the one hand -- and Carolle on the other. He did not believe that Jean knew about Carolle, and he intended to tell her before anyone else did. But somehow he had never got round to it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="乔治低头看着她，除了同情，再没有别的感情，自己怎么会在这样短的时间里发生如此大的变化，真是奇怪。他依然喜欢她，毕竟她给自己生了两个孩子，是自己生活中的一部分。但乔治这样一个健忘的人还能记得多少当初那个让他心动的女孩简·莫瑞尔呢？现在他的爱一半属于孩子，一半属于卡罗尔。简肯定还不知道卡罗尔的事，他一直打算亲口告诉她，但一直没有时间。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In due course the Inspector presented his report. The Islanders would have given much to see it. All the statistics and records went into the insatiable memories of the great computers which were some, but not all, of the unseen powers behind Karellen.

Sometimes, Jean thought a little wearily, he filled to perfection the classic recipe for a small boy: "a noise surrounded by dirt".

He showed no preference for one parent rather than the other, and the arrival of his little sister had not produced any signs of jealousy. His medical card was spotless; he had never had a day's illness in his life. But in these times, and in such a climate, there was nothing unusual about this.</div>

<div class="line_en">Unlike some boys, Jeff did not grow quickly bored by his father's company and desert him whenever possible for associates of his own age. It was obvious that he shared George's artistic talents, and almost as soon as he was able to walk had become a regular back-stage visitor to the Colony's theatre. Indeed, the theatre had adopted him as an unofficial mascot, and he was now highly skilled at presenting bouquets to visiting celebrities of stage and screen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="与其他男孩不同的是，杰弗不觉得和爸爸在一起很乏味，也没有千方百计撇开爸爸去和同龄的伙伴玩。显然他也有乔治的艺术天赋，刚会走，他就成了城市剧院后台上的常客，事实上，剧院已经把他当成了非正式的头面人物，现在他给那些来访的舞台与影视贵宾们献花已经相当在行了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Yes, Jeff was a perfectly ordinary boy. So George reassured himself as they went for walks or rides together over the Island's rather restricted terrain. They would talk as sons and fathers had done since the beginning of time -- except that in this age there was so much more to talk about. Though Jeff never left the Island, he could see all that he wished of the surrounding world through the ubiquitous eye of the television screen. He felt, like all the Colonists, a slight disdain for the rest of mankind. They were the elite, the vanguard of progress. They would take Mankind to the heights that the Overlords had reached -- and perhaps beyond. Not tomorrow, certainly, but one day.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="的确，杰弗只是个普普通通的孩子。父子俩在岛上人少的地方散步或骑自行车的时候，乔治总这样想。他们和以往的父子一样交谈，只是现在谈的东西比以前更多。尽管杰弗从来没有离开过小岛，但他可以通过看电视了解地球上的其他地方。和岛上的其他人一样他不大看得起其他地方的人。新雅典的人都是杰出人物，是人类发展的先头部队，他们将带领人类达到外星人的发展水平，甚至比他们的水平还要高。当然不是明天，终究…">查看中文翻译</div>
