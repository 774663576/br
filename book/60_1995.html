<div class="line_en">Or so it happened in Tereza's dream. She told it to Tomas the minute he woke up, and they both found a certain consolation in it. It transformed Karenin's illness into a pregnancy and the drama of giving birth into something both laughable and touching: two rolls and a bee.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是特蕾莎刚刚做的一个梦。醒来后，她讲给托马斯听，两人都从中感到一丝安慰，因为在这个梦里，卡列宁的病转变成了妊娠，而且分娩这场戏有着一个既好笑又令人心动的结局：竟然是两个羊角面包和一只蜜蜂。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She went off without him. Where's Karenin? asked the woman behind the counter, who had Karenin's roll ready as usual. Tereza carried it home herself in her bag, She pulled it out and showed it to him while still in the doorway. She wanted him to come and fetch it. But he just lay there motionless.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是她没有带上卡列宁独自走了。“卡列宁呢？”女售货员问道，她已经为它准备好了一个羊角面包。这一次，是特蕾莎亲自将这个面包带回小屋。她一踏进门槛，就把面包拿出给卡列宁看。她希望它自己走过来取。可是卡列宁仍旧躺着，一动不动。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She again fell prey to illogical hopes. She got out of bed and put on her clothes. Here, too, her day began with a trip to the shop for milk, bread, rolls. But when she called Karenin for his walk that morning, he barely raised his head. It was the first time that he had refused to take part in the ritual he himself had forced upon them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她顿时又生出一线荒诞的希望。她马上起床，穿上衣服。在乡下也一样，她每天早上第一件事就是采购：去杂货店买牛奶、面包、羊角面包。可是这天，她叫卡列宁陪她一块去时，卡列宁勉强抬起头。它这还是头一回拒绝特蕾莎，因为往常它总是执拗地非要求出席这一仪式不可。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Those yelps were Karenin's smile, and they wanted it to last as long as possible. So Tomas crawled back to him and tore off the end of the roll sticking out of Karenin's mouth. Their faces were so close that Tomas could smell the dog's breath, feel the long hairs on Karenin's muzzle tickling him. The dog gave out another yelp and his mouth twitched; now they each had half a roll between their teeth. Then Karenin made an old tactical error: he dropped his half in the hope of seizing the half in his master's mouth, forgetting, as always, that Tomas was not a dog and had hands. Without letting his half of the roll out of his mouth, Tomas picked up the other half from the floor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这叫声，就是卡列宁的微笑，他们想让这微笑尽可能持续下去。于是，托马斯又趴在地上，向狗爬去，抓住露在它嘴边的那截面包。他俩的脸挨得更近，托马斯感到了狗的呼吸，卡列宁嘴边长长的毛挠得托马斯的脸痒痒的。狗又叫了一声，猛地摇着嘴巴。他俩的嘴里各留下半个羊角面包。卡列宁又犯了老毛病，它丢下自己的那半个面包，试图抢托马斯嘴里的那半个。同往常一样，它忘了托马斯不是一条狗，他还有一双手。托马斯非但没有松开含在自己嘴里的那半截，反而还用手捡起掉在地上的那一半。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Karenin followed him with his eyes, which seemed to show a glimmer of interest, but he did not pick himself up. Tomas brought his face right up to his muzzle.</div>

<div class="line_en">Still on all fours, Tomas retreated a little, arched his back, and started yelping, making believe he wanted to fight over the roll.

<div class="line_cn" title="一直趴在地上的托马斯，这时朝后退了几步，蜷缩起身子，学狗叫了起来。他假装要争夺面包的样子，卡列宁汪汪叫着，向主人作出回应。这正是他们期待的！卡列宁居然想玩！它还有活下去的欲望。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="特蕾莎听从了。她打开壁橱，去找那架被扔在一个角落里早被遗忘的照相机。托马斯接着说：“将来某一天，我们会为拥有这些照片而感到欣慰的。卡列宁，曾经是我们生活的一部分。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The next day his condition actually appeared to have improved. They had lunch. It was the time of day when they normally took him out for a walk. His habit was to start running back and forth between them restlessly. On that day, however, Tereza picked up the leash and collar only to be stared at dully. They tried to look cheerful (for and about him) and pep him up a bit, and after a long wait he took pity on them, tottered over on his three legs, and let her put on the collar.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天，卡列宁的状况好像有了好转。托马斯和特蕾莎吃了午饭，这会儿他俩有一个钟头的自由时间，是带狗出去散步的时候。卡列宁知道这一点，往常，还没到钟点，它就等不及地在他俩身边蹦来蹦去，可是这次，当特蕾莎拿起皮带和项圈时，它久久地看着他俩，一动不动。他们站在它面前，竭力显示出快乐的样子（因为它，也为了它），想给它感染一些愉快的情绪。过了一会儿，仿佛它对主人起了怜悯之心，于是用三只脚瘸着走过去，让他们给它戴上了项圈。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Hearing the door open, he slipped it in among some other papers, but she saw him do it. On her way out of the room she also noticed him stuffing the letter into his pocket. But he forgot about the envelope. As soon as she was alone in the house, she studied it carefully. The address was written in an unfamiliar hand, but it was very neat and she guessed it to be a woman's.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="托马斯听见开门声，赶紧把信插入一堆纸中。特蕾莎已经看到了这一幕。她走出房间时，见托马斯又将信塞进了口袋。可是他忘了信封。当屋里只有特蕾莎一人时，她便仔细地看起信封来。地址的笔迹很陌生，字写得很端正，像出自女人的手。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">No, said Tomas, and filled Tereza with despair, a despair all the worse for her having grown unaccustomed to it. No, she did not believe he had a secret mistress in the village. That was all but impossible. She knew what he did with every spare minute. He must have kept up with a woman in Prague who meant so much to him that he thought of her even if she could no longer leave the smell of her groin in his hair. Tereza did not believe that Tomas meant to leave her for the woman, but the happiness of their two years in the country now seemed besmirched by lies.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没有，”托马斯答道。特蕾莎顿时感到一阵绝望，甚至是残酷的绝望，因为她很久没有这种感觉了。不，她不相信托马斯会在这里偷偷地与别的女人幽会。这几乎是不可能的。他的空闲时间是怎么过的，她一清二楚。不过，也许在布拉格，有一个让他念念不忘、让他痴迷的女人，即使这个女人不能再在他的头发里留下下体的味道。特蕾莎不相信托马斯会为了这个女人而离开自己，可她感到，最近这两年在乡下度过的幸福时光同过去一样，因为谎言而变得毫无价值。">查看中文翻译</div>
