<div class="line_en">It was a sunny September afternoon when I heaved my suitcase through Harvard Yard. The colonial architecture felt foreign but also crisp and unimposing compared to the Gothic pinnacles of Cambridge. The central library, called the Widener, was the largest I had ever seen, and for a few minutes I forgot the past year and stared up at it, wonderstruck.</div>

<div class="line_en">My room was in the graduate dorms near the law school. It was small and cavelike -- dark, moist, frigid, with ashen walls and cold tiles the color of lead. I spent as little time in it as possible. The university seemed to offer a new beginning, and I intended to take it. I enrolled in every course I could squeeze into my schedule, from German idealism to the history of secularism to ethics and law. I joined a weekly study group to practice French, and another to learn knitting. The graduate school offered a free course on charcoal sketching. I had never drawn in my life but I signed up for that, too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我的房间在法学院附近的研究生宿舍里。房间很小，像个洞穴——黑暗、潮湿又阴冷，有着灰色的墙壁和冰冷的铅色瓷砖。我尽量不在里面待着。这所大学似乎提供了一个新的开始，我打算接受它。我将能选的课程排得满满的，从德国理想主义到世俗主义的历史，再到伦理和法律。我参加了一个每周一次的学习小组练习法语，还参加了一个社团学习编织。研究生院开设了一门免费的炭笔素描课，虽然我这辈子从没画过画，但也报名参加了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I began to read -- Hume, Rousseau, Smith, Godwin, Wollstonecraft and Mill. I lost myself in the world they had lived in, the problems they had tried to solve. I became obsessed with their ideas about the family -- with how a person ought to weigh their special obligations to kin against their obligations to society as a whole. Then I began to write, weaving the strands I'd found in Hume's Principles of Morals with filaments from Mill's The Subjection of Women. It was good work, I knew it even as I wrote it, and when I'd finished I set it aside. It was the first chapter of my PhD.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我开始大量阅读休谟、卢梭、史密斯、戈德温、沃斯通克拉夫特和穆勒的作品。我迷失在他们生活过的世界里，迷失在他们试图解决的问题中。我着迷于他们对家庭的看法——个人应该如何权衡自己对亲人的特殊义务以及对整个社会的义务。我开始写作，把从休谟的《道德原则研究》中发现的线索与穆勒《论妇女的从属地位》中的细节编织在一起。写的时候我就知道这是一部不错的作品，写完后我将它放在一边。这就是我博士学位论文的第一章。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A few days later, I signed in to an old chat program I hadn't used in years. There was a cheerful jingle and a name turned from gray to green. Charles is online, it said.

<div class="line_en">I returned from my sketching class one Saturday morning to find an email from my mother. We're coming to Harvard, she said. I read that line at least three times, certain she was joking. My father did not travel -- I'd never known him to go anywhere except Arizona to visit his mother -- so the idea that he would fly across the country to see a daughter he believed taken by the devil seemed ludicrous. Then I understood: he was coming to save me. Mother said they had already booked their flights and would be staying in my dorm room.</div>

<div class="line_en">I asked what he'd done after graduating from college and there was a strained silence. "Things didn't go the way I planned," he said. He'd never graduated. He'd dropped out his sophomore year after his son was born, because his wife was sick and there was a mound of medical bills. He'd signed on to work the oil rigs in Wyoming. "It was only supposed to be for a few months," he said. "That was a year ago."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我问他大学毕业后在做什么，换来一阵尴尬的沉默。“计划不如变化快。”他说。他没能大学毕业。大二时他的儿子出生了，他便辍学了，因为他的妻子病了，有一大堆医药费要付。他去了怀俄明州的石油钻井平台工作。“本来只干几个月，”他说，“那是一年前的事了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I told him about Shawn, how I'd lost him, how I was losing the rest of my family. He listened quietly, then let out a long sigh and said, "Have you ever thought maybe you should just let them go?"</div>

<div class="line_en">My parents arrived as the leaves began to turn, when campus was at its most beautiful, the reds and yellows of autumn mingling with the burgundy of colonial brick. With his hayseed grammar, denim shirt and lifetime-member NRA cap, Dad would have always been out of place at Harvard, but his scarring intensified the effect. I had seen him many times in the years since the explosion, but it wasn't until he came to Harvard, and I saw him set against my life there, that I realized how severely he'd disfigured himself. That awareness reached me through the eyes of others -- strangers whose faces changed when he passed them in the street, who turned to get a second look. Then I would look at him, too, and notice how the skin on his chin was taut and plastic; how his lips lacked natural roundness; how his cheeks sucked inward at an angle that was almost skeletal. His right hand, which he often raised to point at some feature or other, was knotted and twisted, and when I gazed at it, set against Harvard's antediluvian steeples and columns, it seemed to me the claw of some mythical creature.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="树叶开始变色时，我的父母来到了校园。那正值校园最美丽的时候，秋日红色和黄色的树叶与殖民时期建筑风格的酒红色砖墙交相辉映。爸爸说着语法混乱的乡巴佬英语，身着牛仔衬衫，戴着美国步枪协会终身会员的帽子，与哈佛的环境是那样格格不入，他的疤痕更强化了这个效果。那次爆炸后的几年里，我已见过他多次，但直到他来到哈佛，在我生活的衬托下，我才意识到他的毁容有多么严重。我通过路人的眼睛意识到了这一点——他在街上从陌生人身边走过时，那些人脸色大变，还会回头再看他一眼。然后我也会看着他，注意到他下巴上的皮肤像塑料一样紧绷，他的嘴唇缺少自然的弧度，他的双颊像骷髅一样向内凹陷。他经常举起变形扭曲的右手，指着某个东西，而当我盯着它，看着它正指向哈佛大学古老的尖塔和圆柱，它在我眼中似乎便成了某种神秘生物的爪子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dad had little interest in the university, so I took him into the city.

A homeless man passed through our subway car and asked for a dollar. Dad gave him a crisp fifty.</div>

I could take it all back -- blame Lucifer and be given a clean slate. I imagined how esteemed I would be, as a newly cleansed vessel. How loved.

<div class="line_en">When I reflect on that moment now, the image blurs, reconstituting itself into that of a zealous knight astride a steed, charging into an imaginary battle, striking at shadows, hacking into thin air. His jaw is set, his back straight. His eyes blaze with conviction, throwing sparks that burn where they lay. My mother gives me a pale, disbelieving look, but when he turns his gaze on her they become of one mind, then they are both tilting at windmills.</div>

<div class="line_en">My father wanted to visit the Sacred Grove in Palmyra, New York -- the forest where, according to Joseph Smith, God had appeared and commanded him to found the true church. We rented a car and six hours later entered Palmyra. Near the grove, off the highway, there was a shimmering temple topped by a golden statue of the angel Moroni. Dad pulled over and asked me to cross the temple grounds. "Touch the temple," he said. "Its power will cleanse you."</div>

<div class="line_en">In the days that followed, I wrote that passage everywhere -- unconsciously, compulsively. I find it now in books I was reading, in my lecture notes, in the margins of my journal. Its recitation was a mantra. I willed myself to believe it -- to believe there was no real difference between what I knew to be true and what I knew to be false. To convince myself that there was some dignity in what I planned to do, in surrendering my own perceptions of right and wrong, of reality, of sanity itself, to earn the love of my parents. For them I believed I could don armor and charge at giants, even if I saw only windmills.</div>

Every morning my father trudged up a flight of stairs to the communal shower in nothing but a small white towel. This would have humiliated me at BYU, but at Harvard I shrugged.

It was as if he realized we were making a memory, something beautiful we might need later. Or perhaps I'm projecting, because that was how I felt.

He would lay his hands on my head and cast out the evil thing that had made me say what I had said, that had made me unwelcome in my own family. All I had to do was yield, and in five minutes it would be over.</div>

<div class="line_en">The blessing was a mercy. He was offering me the same terms of surrender he had offered my sister. I imagined what a relief it must have been for her, to realize she could trade her reality -- the one she shared with me -- for his. How grateful she must have felt to pay such a modest price. I could not judge her for her choice, but in that moment I knew I could not choose it for myself. Everything I had worked for, all my years of study, had been to purchase for myself this one privilege: to see and experience more truths than those given to me by my father, and to use those truths to construct my own mind. I had come to believe that the ability to evaluate many ideas, many histories, many points of view, was at the heart of what it means to self-create. If I yielded now, I would lose more than an argument. I would lose custody of my own mind. This was the price I was being asked to pay, I understood that now. What my father wanted to cast from me wasn't a demon: it was me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="赐福是一种仁慈。他对我提出的条件与对我姐姐提过的一样。我能想象出，当她意识到能用她与我分享的现实和他的交换，那一定是一种解脱。只付出这么少的代价，她一定很感激。我不能指责她的选择，但在那一刻，我知道自己不会做出那样的选择。我所有的奋斗，我多年来的学习，一直为了让自己得到这样一种特权：见证和体验超越父亲所给予我的更多的真理，并用这些真理构建我自己的思想。我开始相信，评价多种思想、多种历史和多种观点的能力是自我创造力的核心。如果现在让步，我失去的将不仅仅是一次争论。我会失去对自己思想的掌控权。这就是要求我付出的代价，我现在明白了这一点。父亲想从我身上驱逐的不是恶魔，而是我自己。">查看中文翻译</div>
