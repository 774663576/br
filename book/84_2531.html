<div class="line_en">She was sitting at the kitchen counter, watching Mother rummage through our birchwood cabinets. An electric scale sat on the counter between them, and occasionally Mother would use it to weigh dried leaves. It was spring. There was a morning chill despite the bright sunlight.</div>

<div class="line_en">I retrieved the tincture, and my mother packed it in a plastic grocery bag with the dried herbs. "Anything else?" Mother laughed. The pitch was high, nervous. The midwife intimidated her, and when intimidated my mother took on a weightless quality, whisking about every time the midwife made one of her slow, solid movements.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我取回酊剂，母亲把它和干药草一起装在一个塑料食品袋里。“还需要别的吗？”母亲大笑着说，音调很高，很紧张。助产士让她感到害怕，每当害怕时，母亲就会变得轻飘飘的，而每当助产士做出一个缓慢而坚定的动作，她都晃来晃去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She was a short, plump woman in her late forties, with eleven children and a russet-colored wart on her chin. She had the longest hair I'd ever seen, a cascade the color of field mice that fell to her knees when she took it out of its tight bun. Her features were heavy, her voice thick with authority. She had no license, no certificates. She was a midwife entirely by the power of her own say-so, which was more than enough.</div>

Mother with her rose-petal skin and her hair curled into soft waves that bounced about her shoulders. Her eyelids shimmered. Mother did her makeup every morning, but if she didn't have time she'd apologize all day, as if by not doing it, she had inconvenienced everyone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="母亲将做她的助手。记得第一天我看着她们，暗自比较。母亲有着玫瑰花瓣般的皮肤，头发卷成柔软的波浪，在肩膀周围跳来跳去，眼皮闪闪发亮。母亲每天早上都化妆，如果来不及化妆，她一整天都会为此道歉，就好像不化妆给所有人都带来了不便。">查看中文翻译</div>

I stared hopefully at her. I hadn't met many other girls like me, who didn't go to school. I edged closer, trying to draw her attention, but she was wholly absorbed in listening to her mother, who was explaining how cramp bark and motherwort should be administered to treat post-birth contractions. Maria's head bobbed in agreement; her eyes never left her mother's face.</div>

The labor had been long, grueling, and when the baby finally came the mother had torn, and badly. There was blood everywhere. The hemorrhage wouldn't stop.

<div class="line_en">Mother didn't want to be a midwife. Midwifery had been Dad's idea, one of his schemes for self-reliance. There was nothing he hated more than our being dependent on the Government. Dad said one day we would be completely off the grid. As soon as he could get the money together, he planned to build a pipeline to bring water down from the mountain, and after that he'd install solar panels all over the farm. That way we'd have water and electricity in the End of Days, when everyone else was drinking from puddles and living in darkness. Mother was an herbalist so she could tend our health, and if she learned to midwife she would be able to deliver the grandchildren when they came along.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="母亲不想当助产士。这自始至终都是爸爸的主意，是他自力更生计划的一部分。没有什么比我们依赖政府更令他厌恶的了。爸爸说总有一天我们会完全自给自足。待他一筹到钱，他就计划修建一条从山上取水的管道，然后在农场各处安装太阳能电池板。这样，在世界末日，当其他人都生活在黑暗中，喝水坑里的水，我们还有水和电。母亲是草药师，所以她能照料我们的健康；如果她学会助产，就能在孙子孙女出生时接生了。">查看中文翻译</div>

By the time the leaves started to fall she'd helped with a dozen births. By the end of winter, several dozen. In the spring she told my father she'd had enough, that she could deliver a baby if she had to, if it was the End of the World. Now she could stop.</div>

<div class="line_en">A few weeks later, this prediction was tested. It was midnight. Because we didn't have a phone, the midwife called Grandma-down-the-hill, who walked up the hill, tired and ornery, and barked that it was time for Mother to go "play doctor."

<div class="line_en">Midwifery was not illegal in the state of Idaho, but it had not yet been sanctioned. If a delivery went wrong, a midwife might face charges for practicing medicine without a license; if things went very wrong, she could face criminal charges for manslaughter, even prison time. Few women would take such a risk, so midwives were scarce: on the day Judy left for Wyoming, Mother became the only midwife for a hundred miles.</div>

<div class="line_en">The woman returned several times, perching on our sofa again and again, describing the uncomplicated births of her other children.

Each time the woman left Dad could hardly contain his excitement, so that finally, succumbing to either the woman's desperation or to Dad's elation, or to both, Mother gave way.</div>

<div class="line_en">The birth went smoothly. Then the woman had a friend who was also pregnant, and Mother delivered her baby as well. Then that woman had a friend. Mother took on an assistant. Before long she was delivering so many babies that Audrey and I spent our days driving around the valley with her, watching her conduct prenatal exams and prescribe herbs. She became our teacher in a way that, because we rarely held school at home, she'd never been before. She explained every remedy and palliative. If So-and-so's blood pressure was high, she should be given hawthorn to stabilize the collagen and dilate the coronary blood vessels. If Mrs. Someone-or-other was having premature contractions, she needed a bath in ginger to increase the supply of oxygen to the uterus.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mother charged about five hundred dollars for a delivery, and this was another way midwifing changed her: suddenly she had money. Dad didn't believe that women should work, but I suppose he thought it was all right for Mother to be paid for midwifing, because it undermined the Government. Also, we needed the money. Dad worked harder than any man I knew, but scrapping and building barns and hay sheds didn't bring in much, and it helped that Mother could buy groceries with the envelopes of small bills she kept in her purse. Sometimes, if we'd spent the whole day flying about the valley, delivering herbs and doing prenatal exams, Mother would use that money to take me and Audrey out to eat. Grandma-over-in-town had given me a journal, pink with a caramel-colored teddy bear on the cover, and in it I recorded the first time Mother took us to a restaurant, which I described as "real fancy with menus and everything." According to the entry, my meal came to $3.30.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="母亲接生一次收费五百美元左右，这也是助产工作让她发生变化的另一种方式：突然间她有钱了。爸爸认为女人不应该工作，但我想他觉得母亲做助产士收费没有错，因为这损害了政府的利益，况且我们需要钱。虽然爸爸干起活来那股劲头无人能比，但是拆解废品、盖谷仓和干草棚并没有带来多少收入。而母亲掏腰包，用装在信封里的小额钞票买点儿食品杂货，还是帮了大忙的。有时候，如果我们一整天都在山谷里忙活，送草药、做产检，母亲就会用赚来的钱带我和奥黛丽出去吃饭。城里外婆以前送给我一本粉色日记本，封面上画着一只焦糖色的泰迪熊，里面记录着母亲第一次带我们去餐厅吃饭的情景。我是这样描述的：“真正的梦幻之地，有菜单和一切。”根据那则日记，我的那顿饭花了三美元三十美分。">查看中文翻译</div>

She bought an oxygen tank in case a baby came out and couldn't breathe, and she took a suturing class so she could stitch the women who tore. Judy had always sent women to the hospital for stitches, but Mother was determined to learn. Self-reliance, I imagine her thinking.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mother began to file the paperwork. I don't know if she talked it over with Dad first. If she did, I can't explain what changed his mind -- why suddenly a ten-year policy of not registering with the Government ended without a struggle -- but I think maybe it was that telephone. It was almost as if my father had come to accept that if he were really going to do battle with the Government, he would have to take certain risks. Mother's being a midwife would subvert the Medical Establishment, but in order to be a midwife she needed a phone. Perhaps the same logic was extended to Luke: Luke would need income to support a family, to buy supplies and prepare for the End of Days, so he needed a birth certificate. The other possibility is that Mother didn't ask Dad. Perhaps she just decided, on her own, and he accepted her decision. Perhaps even he -- charismatic gale of a man that he was -- was temporarily swept aside by the force of her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="母亲着手准备书面申请。我不知道她是否先和爸爸商量过。如果她商量了，我无法解释是什么原因让他改变了主意——十年来他一直拒绝到政府部门注册，为什么突然放弃了抗争——但我觉得也许是因为那部电话。父亲似乎接受了这个事实：如果真要和政府开战，必须承担一定风险。母亲做助产士是对医疗机构的颠覆，但作为助产士，她需要一部电话。也许同样的逻辑也适用于卢克：卢克要想赚钱供养一个家庭，购买补给，为世界末日做准备，就需要一份出生证明。还有一种可能是母亲根本没跟爸爸商量。也许是她自己做主，而他接受了她的决定。也许就连威风凛凛的父亲一时也被她的力量所震慑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Once she had begun the paperwork for Luke, Mother decided she might as well get birth certificates for all of us. It was harder than she expected. She tore the house apart looking for documents to prove we were her children. She found nothing. In my case, no one was sure when I'd been born. Mother remembered one date, Dad another, and Grandma-down-the-hill, who went to town and swore an affidavit that I was her granddaughter, gave a third date.</div>

What if there was a medical history they hadn't told her about, some complication?

In a few minutes we would be there, and she would have two lives in her small, trembling hands. Until that moment, I'd never understood the risk she was taking. "People die in hospitals," she whispered, her fingers clenching the wheel, wraithlike. "Sometimes God calls them home, and there's nothing anyone can do.
