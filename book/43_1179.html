<div class="line_en">At three, Daisy demanded a 'needler', and actually made a bag with four stitches in it. She likewise set up housekeeping in the sideboard, and managed a microscopic cooking stove with a skill that brought tears of pride to Hannah's eyes, while Demi learned his letters with his grandfather, who invented a new mode of teaching the alphabet by forming letters with his arms and legs, thus uniting gymnastics for head and heels. The boy early developed a mechanical genius which delighted his father and distracted his mother, for he tried to imitate every machine he saw, and kept the nursery in a chaotic condition, with his 'sewinsheen', a mysterious structure of string, chairs, clothespins, and spools, for wheels to go 'wound and wound'. Also a basket hung over the back of a chair, in which he vainly tried to hoist his too confiding sister, who, with feminine devotion, allowed her little head to be bumped till rescued, when the young inventor indignantly remarked, "Why, Marmar, dat's my lellywaiter, and me's trying to pull her up."</div>

<div class="line_en">I cannot feel that I have done my duty as humble historian of the March family, without devoting at least one chapter to the two most precious and important members of it. Daisy and Demi had now arrived at years of discretion, for in this fast age babies of three or four assert their rights, and get them, too, which is more than many of their elders do. If there ever were a pair of twins in danger of being utterly spoiled by adoration, it was these prattling Brookes. Of course they were the most remarkable children ever born, as will be shown when I mention that they walked at eight months, talked fluently at twelve months, and at two years they took their places at table, and behaved with a propriety which charmed all beholders.</div>

<div class="line_en">Though utterly unlike in character, the twins got on remarkably well together, and seldom quarreled more than thrice a day. Of course, Demi tyrannized over Daisy, and gallantly defended her from every other aggressor, while Daisy made a galley slave of herself, and adored her brother as the one perfect being in the world. A rosy, chubby, sunshiny little soul was Daisy, who found her way to everybody's heart, and nestled there. One of the captivating children, who seem made to be kissed and cuddled, adorned and adored like little goddesses, and produced for general approval on all festive occasions. Her small virtues were so sweet that she would have been quite angelic if a few small naughtinesses had not kept her delightfully human. It was all fair weather in her world, and every morning she scrambled up to the window in her little nightgown to look out, and say, no matter whether it rained or shone, "Oh, pitty day, oh, pitty day!" Everyone was a friend, and she offered kisses to a stranger so confidingly that the most inveterate bachelor relented, and baby-lovers became faithful worshipers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽然双胞胎性格完全不同，他们相处得还是非常好，一天中极少有争吵三次以上的。当然，德米对黛西横行霸道，却英勇地护卫着她不受任何别的侵略者的侵犯；而黛西把自己当成划船的奴隶，她崇拜哥哥，认为他是世上完美无缺的人。黛西是个面色红润、身体圆胖、快快活活的小东西，她讨每个人的欢心，并舒舒服服地在大家心中安顿下来。这个有魅力的小家伙似乎生来就是让人亲吻、拥抱、打扮，喜爱的，像个小女神。去所有喜庆场合，有了她是让大家赞许的，她的小小德行那样美好。要不是一些小淘气行为使她带着不安分的天性，她就是个十足的天使了。她的世界，总是阳光灿烂。每天早晨，她身穿小睡袍，爬到窗口向外看，不管下雨还是天晴，她总说：“噢，考（好）天！噢，考天！”她那样信任地让陌生人亲吻，使得最顽固的独身者也动了怜爱之心，爱孩子的人们更是深情切切。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As she grew, her mother began to feel that the Dovecote would be blessed by the presence of an inmate as serene and loving as that which had helped to make the old house home, and to pray that she might be spared a loss like that which had lately taught them how long they had entertained an angel unawares. Her grandfather often called her 'Beth', and her grandmother watched over her with untiring devotion, as if trying to atone for some past mistake, which no eye but her own could see.</div>

But when Mr. Bhaer came, Jo neglected her playfellows, and dismay and desolation fell upon their little souls. Daisy, who was fond of going about peddling kisses, lost her best customer and became bankrupt. Demi, with infantile penetration, soon discovered that Dodo like to play with 'the bear-man' better than she did him, but though hurt, he concealed his anguish, for he hadn't the heart to insult a rival who kept a mine of chocolate drops in his waistcoat pocket, and a watch that could be taken out of its case and freely shaken by ardent admirers.</div>

<div class="line_en">Gentlemen are sometimes seized with sudden fits of admiration for the young relatives of ladies whom they honor with their regard, but this counterfeit philoprogenitiveness sits uneasily upon them, and does not deceive anybody a particle. Mr. Bhaer's devotion was sincere, however likewise effective -- for honesty is the best policy in love as in law. He was one of the men who are at home with children, and looked particularly well when little faces made a pleasant contrast with his manly one. His business, whatever it was, detained him from day to day, but evening seldom failed to bring him out to see -- well, he always asked for Mr. March, so I suppose he was the attraction. The excellent papa labored under the delusion that he was, and reveled in long discussions with the kindred spirit, till a chance remark of his more observing grandson suddenly enlightened him.</div>

<div class="line_en">"'Tisn't in mine head, it's in mine mouf," answered literal Demi, putting out his tongue, with a chocolate drop on it, thinking she alluded to confectionery, not ideas.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不是放在我脑子里，而是放在我嘴趴（巴）里，”抠字眼的德米回答。他伸出舌头，上面有一颗巧克力糖块，他以为乔指的是糖果，不是指思想。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Thou shouldst save some for the little friend. Sweets to the sweet, mannling," and Mr. Bhaer offered Jo some, with a look that made her wonder if chocolate was not the nectar drunk by the gods. Demi also saw the smile, was impressed by it, and artlessy inquired…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你该给小朋友留一些。糖果给亲爱的嘛，小大人。”巴尔先生给了乔一些。他的表情使乔奇怪巧克力是不是众神饮用之酒。德米也看到了他的笑容，他为之感动，率直地询问道——">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You precocious chick! Who put that into your head?" said Jo, enjoying the innocent revelation as much as the Professor.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="就像小华盛顿那样，巴尔先生“不能说谎”。于是，他含含糊糊地回答他相信有时是这样的。他的语调使得马奇先生放下了衣刷，瞥了瞥乔羞怯的面容，然后沉进椅子里，他看上去好像那“早熟的孩子”把一个又甜又酸的念头放入了他的脑子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Why Dodo, when she caught him in the china closet half an hour afterward, nearly squeezed the breath out of his little body with a tender embrace, instead of shaking him for being there, and why she followed up this novel performance by the unexpected gift of a big slice of bread and jelly, remained one of the problems over which Demi puzzled his small wits, and was forced to leave unsolved forever.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="半小时后，乔乔姨在瓷器橱里捉住了德米，她没有因为他跑进那里而揍他，而是亲切地搂抱着他的小身体，差点让他透不过起来。作出这种新举动之后，又给了他一个意外的礼物，一大块涂了果酱的面包。乔乔姨为什么这样做呢？德米的小脑袋百思不得其解，被迫永远放弃这个问题不去解决它了。">查看中文翻译</div>
