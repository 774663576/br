<div class="line_en">The next fortnight passes swiftly, and for the first time since we left London, Oxana seems calm and focused. She's naturally secretive, an archetypal lone wolf, and planning an assassination with me is not easy for her. It isn't easy for me, either; murder is murder after all, even if the intended victim is a horrible person like the Pakhan. But we've both kept going. Oxana has begun to share her thoughts with me, and I've managed to ignore what she dismissively refers to as my "civilian guilt," and concentrate on practicalities and logistics. I've always been good at that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I'm touched by how hard she's trying to make our collaboration work, and more than that, to make our relationship work. She has no instinct directing her here. She knows how to excite, manipulate and hurt me, but despite the fact that we've lived in each other's pockets for the best part of a month, she still finds my feelings impossible to read. I catch her sometimes, gazing at me with her sea-gray eyes, trying to access my emotions. I find this so heart-rending. I can't imagine how lonely it must be to have your nose forever pressed against the glass separating you from other people. To be eternally out in the cold, trying to look in.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Pakhan's regular ports of call are Zoya's apartment, a clinic in Nevsky Prospekt where Zoya goes for Botox shots and he for rejuvenation injections, and the Elizarova bathhouse in Proletarskaya. Meetings with the Kupchino Bratva brigadiers are either conducted at an Ossetian restaurant named Zarina, where a private room is reserved for the Pakhan and his guests, or at the bathhouse. Occasionally Dzabrati also entertains at home, with Rushana acting as hostess to gang members and their families. At intervals he visits his cardiologist at a private clinic in the city center. He has a heart condition, believed to be atrial fibrillation, for which he takes Digoxin tablets.</div>

<div class="line_en">I'll make her feel my love, even if it kills me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Asmat Dzabrati, the Pakhan, is sixty-nine years old. He lives in an apartment in a massive, gray seventeen-story building on Malaya Balkanskaya Ulitsa, near Kupchino Metro station. He owns several apartments there, which are occupied by, among others, his four bodyguards, his ex-wife Yelena, and his sister Rushana and her husband. He also leases a small apartment behind the Fruzensky department store, a short drive away, where he keeps his "sugar baby," a twenty-four-year-old Ukrainian woman named Zoya whom he met through an introduction agency. His family and Yelena disapprove of this relationship, and refuse to acknowledge Zoya, so she never visits the Malaya Balkanskaya building.</div>

<div class="line_en">So Oxana goes alone, which is how she prefers it. On a couple of occasions she's disappeared for over twenty-four hours at a stretch, returning cold, hungry and dog-tired. At these times I know better than to even try to talk to her. Instead I run her a bath, bring her cheese and cucumber sandwiches and cups of tea, and put her to bed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">All the intelligence we acquire goes into a file, which we scour continuously for recurring patterns. So far we've found none. For all his old-school leadership style, the Pakhan is wary as a fox, and according to Oxana well versed in counter-surveillance. Arrangements and appointments are invariably made at the last minute, decoy cars are used, and his drivers always vary the routes that he travels. As far as we can discover he never uses public transport.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This information has been provided by Dasha, and has been confirmed by surveillance operations mounted by Oxana. I've been involved in some of these, but always at a distance. Mostly I remain by myself in the apartment on Stachek Prospekt, collating and processing information. I'd like to be out there with Oxana, but she's afraid I would get lost or attract attention in some way. She's probably right. I have a terrible sense of direction, and when I was sent on a course with A4, MI5's watcher department, I struggled embarrassingly, and could never get the communications protocol right.</div>

</div>
<div class="line_en">We're looking for cracks in this facade. Vulnerabilities that we can exploit. I've decided to think of the operation as an intellectual exercise, rather as I used to view my activities at MI5. When I found myself in pursuit of Oxana I lost this sense of distance and became over-involved. With this project I'm determined to re-find my objectivity.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Why don't you have a bath?" I ask Oxana. "I'll run one. We can get in together."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We're in our bedroom, sitting in dusty velveteen armchairs, working through murder scenarios. Oxana's reaction to problem-solving seems to be to suspend all activity relating to hygiene, and she's looking particularly grungy this morning. Her hair is standing out from her head in a crown of greasy spikes, her jeans are in shreds, and the grimy pink sweater from the Prekrasnaya Nevesta warehouse, which she has stolen from me and worn every day for a week, is giving off a deathly smell.</div>

<div class="line_en">"As soon as the Pakhan is dead, Dasha calls a meeting of the other brigadiers and announces that she's in charge. No one will say out loud that she was responsible for killing him, but everyone will know it, and they'll also know that if they give her any shit they'll be taken out too."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I'm not convinced. But here we are. As Oxana says, if we don't take Dzabrati out, someone else will. So we might as well accept the contract, get our papers and money, and disappear. I'm concerned that if we stay here too long, word of us will somehow get back to the Twelve.</div>

<div class="line_en">"We could, but it would be difficult. These big Soviet apartment blocks with the narrow corridors were designed for easy surveillance of everyone coming and going. There are two elevators serving the building, both very slow, and there's always one boyevik at the street entrance and another on the ninth floor, where the Pakhan and his people live. Also, Dzabrati is never alone in his apartment. There's always a bodyguard. Add in family members, kids… It's not impossible, nothing's impossible, but there have got to be easier options."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Possible. He's driven there two or three times a week, usually in the late evening. A bodyguard takes him up to Zoya's apartment, waits outside while he does whatever he does to her, and then walks him back to the car."</div>

Getting inside the apartment when the Pakhan's there would be hard; the door's reinforced and there's a high-definition security camera. There's no way he'd let Zoya buzz a stranger in. Much easier to shoot Dzabrati and the bodyguard inside the building but outside the apartment, in one of the public areas.

<div class="line_en">With the plan finalized, and the arrangements made, Oxana and I suddenly have time on our hands. We go for long walks together, especially in Kupchino, the outlying district from which Dasha's gang gets its name. It's a tough place, a wilderness of deteriorating concrete housing blocks intersected by motorway viaducts and frozen canals. Cut off from the city by an industrial sprawl to the north, the windy streets resemble an abandoned moon colony, but with little sign of a police presence or CCTV cameras we feel safe here. This is Dasha's fiefdom, and when the monolithic gray outlines of the housing blocks soften in the rose-pink twilight at the end of the day, it's almost beautiful.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"Try not to be such a bitch. We could be a good team."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Much of our walking is done in silence. Sometimes we don't speak for an hour, just march side by side beneath cold skies criss-crossed with power and tram cables. We are learning each other. Sometimes I look at her and she's there with me, fully present; sometimes she's blank-eyed, in a dimension all her own. She's trying hard to be considerate, even though it doesn't come at all naturally to her. So she'll suddenly stop beside me on the pavement and gently wipe the snow from my face with her gloved hand, or ask me odd, sweet questions like whether I'm happy, or want a cup of tea. Seeing the determined, slightly perplexed look in her eyes at these moments I want to hug her, but I know that this would infringe her rules about attracting attention in public. So I tell her, truthfully, that I'm happy. I don't think about the killing that lies ahead. I think about now, and the two of us, and the tiny, elusive glimmer of her kindness.</div>

<div class="line_en">We leave the apartment at midday for Kupchino station, and take the Metro two stops northwards to Moskovskaya. Our vehicle is waiting for us outside Alfa Bank, as agreed. It's a Gazelle ambulance, about ten years old, with the interior fixtures stripped out but with emergency lights and siren still in place. According to Dasha, "ambulance-taxis" like this one are regularly hired by wealthy business types who want to beat St. Petersburg's traffic jams and get to meetings on time. With their sirens blaring and their lights blazing, they can thread their way through the worst gridlocks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It's Monday, nine days later, and Dasha has just learned that the Pakhan has ordered his driver to take him from the apartment on Malaya Balkanskaya directly to the Elizarova banya. This works well for Oxana and me. We have everything we need in place, and it's already snowing heavily this afternoon, which will compromise the effectiveness of the CCTV cameras in the streets surrounding the bathhouse.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Pulling on latex gloves we take the keys from the top of the rear wheel, where the owner has left them, and open up the Gazelle. After checking the equipment, we change into official blue ambulance-crew uniforms, and pull on our wigs and cotton caps. Oxana's wig is a garish henna-red, mine peroxide blond. Oxana drives. We've left ourselves plenty of time, so she takes the slow lane on the eastbound motorway, impassively negotiating the busy traffic. She radiates calm, her eyes betraying nothing except anticipation. As for me, I'm all over the place. One moment I'm intensely focused, with my surroundings vibrant and pin-sharp. The next everything is flat and two-dimensional, and I'm so distanced from events it's as if my life is being lived by someone else.</div>

<div class="line_en">To my horror I get a low-battery warning on the phone. Three percent charge remaining. Fuck. I tell Oxana, my heart sinking. She doesn't waste time getting angry with me for forgetting to recharge it, but just nods, all focus. The seconds and minutes crawl past, agonizingly slowly. Two percent battery charge left. The Pakhan will not visit the plunge pool, where the camera is hidden, until he has been through all the steam rooms. I touch the app icon, and a grainy image of the pool fills the phone screen. There's someone in the pool, a big guy, wallowing like a whale, and definitely not the Pakhan. He hauls himself out and vanishes. His place is taken by two older men who descend the ladder one by one, briefly immerse themselves, and leave.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We're in position by quarter to two. Oxana parks in the narrow street that runs alongside the Elizarova banya, thirty meters from the entrance, and we put our feet up on the dashboard and wait for the Pakhan's arrival. My heart is slamming in my chest, and I feel weightless and nauseated. He arrives just two minutes before two o'clock, climbing from a black Mercedes SUV, and I switch on my phone to access the app controlling the microcamera that we planted in the bathhouse three days ago. The motion-activated camera is the size of my thumbnail, and it's held in place by a blob of chewing gum the size of a cherry stone.</div>

<div class="line_en">There's now one percent of the battery charge remaining, and the pool's empty. Another few minutes and the phone's going to die. I feel sick with dread. Fear of letting Oxana down has eclipsed all thought of our real purpose here. We stare at the tiny screen. Oxana's breathing is steady. Her wig, which smells of ancient sweat, tickles my cheek. A figure enters the microcamera's field at the same moment that the screen goes black.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I take a firm grip on the defibrillator unit. It's the monophasic type, at least twenty years old, and heavy. Oxana pushes open the side door of the Gazelle, we hit the pavement running, and seconds later burst through the entrance of the banya. There are two male reception staff sitting at a desk behind a low pile of folded towels. Seeing us they half-rise, and Oxana yells at them to stay where they are. They look uncertain, but our uniforms represent officialdom, and they obey.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Go," says Oxana, grabbing the first-aid pack and the medication bag. "Go, go, go."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Oxana leads the way, marching briskly through the changing room, ignoring the half-naked figures who freeze with surprise at the sight of us, and into the wet-floored steam rooms. Here, again, everyone stares and no one moves. The choking heat makes my scalp run with sweat, and my glasses steam up so that I can't see where I'm going. Grabbing my arm, Oxana drags me into the cold plunge area, I wipe my glasses on my shirt, and there's the Pakhan, alone and naked, submerged up to his chest in the small marble pool. He has an impressive range of faded tattoos, including a knife through his neck, eight-pointed stars on his collarbones, and epaulets on his shoulders.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Our apologies," Oxana murmurs, and touches the defibrillator paddles to the surface of the water. The Pakhan shudders, his eyes widen, and he slips sideways onto his back, his legs trailing underwater. His face turns the color of putty, and his lips bluish-gray. His fingers twitch and grasp feebly at the water. His hands, I notice, are quite small for a man who has killed several people with an ax.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Stand back," Oxana says, and gives him another jolt of electricity.</div>

<div class="line_en">Still Dzabrati doesn't die. Instead he lies there open-mouthed, pillowed by water, staring at me sadly as if disappointed by my choice of wig.

<div class="line_en">I'm still kneeling there when, with a wet slap of plastic sandals, the two reception staff arrive. "I think he's had a heart attack," Oxana explains. "We're trying to get him out. Can you help?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm really sorry about the phone…" I begin, but Oxana is in an affectionate, almost light-headed mood. I'm wearing my black and yellow sweater under my leather jacket and she calls me pchelka, her bee. "You were so good," she says, slipping her arm through mine and dancing us down Moskovsky Avenue toward the Metro. "You really kept your shit together. I'm super-proud of you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One of the men descends the ladder into the water, and between them they manhandle the Pakhan's naked body onto the tiled floor. As they do so Oxana discreetly reaches up and removes the micro camera from the top of the door frame. Kneeling beside the wet body of the Pakhan, I go through the motions of attempting cardiopulmonary resuscitation. To no one's surprise, it doesn't work.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">An hour later, Oxana and I are walking away from the ambulance, which we've left outside Alfa Bank in Moskovskaya, where we found it. We're back in our own clothes. The ambulance service uniforms, the wigs and the medical equipment have been tossed into the back of one of the city's garbage trucks, and are now on their way to a landfill site.</div>
