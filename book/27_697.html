<div class="line_en">Richard and Joe Fuisz sat warily across from David Boies and one of his partners at a table in the lobby lounge of San Jose's Fairmont hotel. It was a Sunday evening in the middle of March and the usually bustling lounge's two grand pianos were quiet, allowing the four men to speak without raising their voices. Boies, looking relaxed and dapper in a navy blazer and his signature black sneakers, had called the meeting to discuss settling the litigation that had pitted the Fuiszes against Theranos for the past two and a half years.</div>

<div class="line_en">Initially determined to fight the lawsuit to the bitter end, Richard and Joe were tired and battered. The trial had started a few days earlier at the federal courthouse down the street and the extent to which they were outgunned had fully dawned on them. Unhappy with their lawyers and their mounting legal costs, they had gone "pro se" several months earlier. What had seemed then like a reasonable decision now looked foolish: Joe, a patent attorney who had never tried a case, was no match for the country's best litigator and his army of associates.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一开始决心官司非打到底不可的理查和乔，现在已经累了，也被打垮了。这起官司几天前才在这条街上的联邦法院开始审理，如今，他们已经完全明白对方的火力优势大到什么程度。由于不满意律师的表现以及不断攀高的诉讼费用，几个月前他们开始「自己出庭辩护」，这个决定在当时看似合理，现在却看来愚蠢。因为，身为专利律师的乔从未上法庭审理，根本不是这位全美最厉害诉讼律师外加一整个律师军团的对手。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">More damaging, though, had been Richard Fuisz's own courtroom testimony two days earlier. Boies had caught him in a series of pointless lies that, while they did nothing to prove Theranos's theft allegations, had undermined his credibility. One of them was Fuisz's contention that he still practiced medicine and treated patients -- a claim his own wife had refuted in her deposition. For no discernible reason other than pride, Fuisz had refused to back away from it even after Boies confronted him with her testimony. In his rambling opening argument, Fuisz had also stated that his patent had nothing to do with Theranos, which was absurd on its face given that his patent application mentioned the company by name and quoted from its website.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，杀伤力更大的是理查．傅伊兹自己两天前在法庭的证词。波伊斯拆穿他一连串对自己毫无助益的谎言，虽然没有坐实Theranos的偷窃指控，但也造成他可信度大减。其中一个谎言是，傅伊兹宣称自己仍然在行医治疗病患，这种说法连他的太太都在作证时否认，傅伊兹甚至在法庭上被波伊斯当面质疑时仍然不愿收回，除了自尊，看不出有任何其他理由。另外，在冗长又不着边际的开场陈述中，他说他的专利跟Theranos一点关系都没有，这话一听就知道很荒谬，因为他的专利申请明明指名道姓提到Theranos，还引用Theranos网站的文本内容。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The death of Ian Gibbons had also been a big setback. It briefly looked like they might be able to make up for it by calling his widow, Rochelle, as a witness. After Richard managed to make contact with her, Rochelle told him that Elizabeth had tried to bully Ian into not testifying and that Ian thought she was dishonest. But the judge overseeing the case had denied the Fuiszes' late motion to call Rochelle to the stand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="伊恩．吉本斯之死也是一大打击。他们一度看似可以改传唤他的遗孀罗雪儿当证人，理查好不容易才联系上她，她告诉理查，伊莉莎白曾经威吓阻止伊恩出庭作证，而且伊恩觉得伊莉莎白不老实，但是主审法官否决了他们要求传唤罗雪儿出庭的申请。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Joe had watched his father's disastrous performance on the stand with growing alarm. His dad had once been an amazing pitchman in business settings because he was a terrific schmoozer and improviser, but that off-the-cuff, loose-with-the-facts approach didn't work when you were being questioned under oath by a legal ace ready to pounce on any inconsistency. It didn't help that, at seventy-four years old, Richard's memory was beginning to slip.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="看着父亲在法庭上的悲剧表现，乔内心的恐慌逐渐升高。他爸爸在商场上一向是个能言善道的推销高手，因为擅长闲聊和即兴演出，但是当你在法庭上宣誓接受讯问，而对方又是随时准备揪出任何话中矛盾的王牌律师时，那一套不经准备、不讲究事实的方法完全不管用。另一个不管用的地方是，理查已经七十四岁，记忆力开始衰退。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When he added it all up in his mind, Joe knew they were in trouble. And with a courtroom defeat looking like a very real possibility, he was haunted by a terrifying thought: What if they not only lost, but the judge made them cover Theranos's legal expenses? He shivered to think how much money their opponent was spending on the case. He worried it might be enough to bankrupt him and his father both. They had already spent more than $2 million on their defense.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在脑中把这些一一加起来之后，乔心里很清楚，他们惨了，看来败诉的可能性非常高，一个可怕的念头盘旋他脑中不去：要是他们不只打输官司，法官还要求他们支付Theranos的诉讼费用呢？一想到对手花在这起官司的费用，他不禁打了个冷颤，他担心可能会把他和父亲两人搞到破产，他们目前为止已经为这场官司花超过两百万美元了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Joe feared his brother John's upcoming testimony might turn into another liability.

<div class="line_en">Boies had come to their powwow with Mike Underhill, one of the Boies Schiller attorneys running point on the litigation. Underhill, a very tall and gangly man, broke the ice by asking Richard Fuisz if he had really grown up on a farm (the answer was yes). That led to Fuisz and Boies discussing raising cattle, which Boies had some experience with from the ranch he owned in Napa Valley. When the conversation eventually turned to the matter at hand, Underhill said both sides would be better off settling the case. If, however, the Fuiszes remained intent on pressing forward with the trial, they should know that matters would be revealed that would destroy John Fuisz. Underhill didn't specify what nor did he say this menacingly. He made it sound as though he liked John and it would pain him to see him get hurt. There was some irony to Underhill's threat to air dirty laundry about John. The two of them had once been colleagues at McDermott Will &amp; Emery and had shared a secretary. Underhill had left McDermott not long after John had made a sexual harassment complaint against him on the secretary's behalf to the firm's human resources department. (Underhill denies any untoward behavior and says his departure from McDermott to join Boies Schiller was already in motion.)</div>

<div class="line_en">The prospect of new damaging information coming out about his brother added yet another worry to Joe's long list, but the truth was that he and his father had come to the meeting ready to settle. It didn't take long for an agreement to take shape: the Fuiszes would withdraw their patent in exchange for Theranos withdrawing its suit. No money would change hands; each party would remain responsible for its legal costs. It amounted to a complete capitulation on the Fuiszes' part. Elizabeth had won.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可能会爆出跟哥哥有关的杀伤性消息，为乔长长的担忧名单再添一笔。不过，事实上他和爸爸来开这个会就是准备和解了。没有花太久时间，和解方案就形成：傅伊兹父子撤销专利权，换取Theranos撤销告诉，没有金钱转手的问题，双方各自负担自己的诉讼费用。这等于是傅伊兹父子的投降书，伊莉莎白获胜。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Boies insisted they draft the agreement right then and there. He wrote the terms down on a piece of paper and passed it to Joe, who made a few modifications. Underhill then took it upstairs to have it typed up. As they waited for Underhill to return, Richard Fuisz complained once more that Elizabeth's theft accusation was false. Playing the part of the magnanimous victor, Boies allowed that that might be the case but he had a client to answer to.</div>

<div class="line_en">Fuisz asked Boies if he could do something for John. His son's reputation had been unjustly sullied, he said. Underhill had previously raised with Joe the notion that Boies Schiller could refer patent work to John if he signed a release promising not to sue Elizabeth or the firm. Boies repeated that offer. He would need to wait six months for things to quiet down, but then he could start sending work John's way. He suggested they get John on the phone to talk it over.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="傅伊兹问波伊斯能否帮约翰一个忙，他说，他这个儿子的名声遭到不公平的抹黑，昂德希尔曾跟乔提过，BSF事务所可以转介专利案子给约翰，只要约翰愿意签署一份声明，答应不控告伊莉莎白或Theranos。波伊斯表示这项提议仍然有效，不过他必须先等半年让事情平息，到时就可以依照约翰的意愿开始介绍工作给他。波伊斯建议当场打电话跟约翰谈一谈。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Fuisz dialed John's number in Washington and passed his cell phone to Boies. As it turned out, John was in no mood to make nice. He had been looking forward to testifying in court. He saw it as his chance to clear his name. Now this settlement would prevent him from doing that. He angrily told Boies there was no way he would ever sign a release unless Theranos issued a public statement exonerating him. Richard and Joe could see the conversation wasn't going well: Boies was holding the phone several inches from his ear and wincing as John shouted on the other end of the line. After a few minutes, Boies passed the phone back to Fuisz. Their little side deal was dead.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="傅伊兹拨了约翰在华盛顿的电话，然后把手机递给波伊斯，结果约翰无意和好，他一直等着要上法庭作证，他认为那是还他清白的机会，现在他们和解却剥夺了这个机会，他很愤怒地告诉波伊斯，他绝对不可能签什么声明，除非Theranos发表公开声明替他澄清。理查和乔都看出这样谈下去不会有好结果，因为波伊斯把手机拿离耳朵好几公分，皱着眉头，电话另一头传来约翰的大声咆哮。几分钟后，波伊斯把电话交还给傅伊兹，他们小小的附带协议声明胎死腹中。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Back in Washington, the settlement didn't sit well with John Fuisz. He was mad at everyone, including his father and brother, for agreeing to a deal that gave Theranos everything it wanted before he'd had a chance to tell his side of the story in court. In his pique, John emailed a young reporter named Julia Love, who had been covering the case for American Lawyer Media, and told her about the quid pro quo Boies had sought the night before, making it sound like an attempt to bribe him. He also vowed to sue Boies and to add his father and brother to the suit as defendants. He then forwarded the email to Underhill and to Richard and Joe, letting them know that anything they sent his way would be forwarded to the media.</div>

<div class="line_en">Julia love's article about the settlement in Litigation Daily, ALM's newsletter, caught the eye of Roger Parloff, Fortune magazine's legal correspondent. Parloff, who had once practiced law as a white-collar criminal defense attorney in Manhattan before becoming a journalist, was always on the lookout for legal sagas to write about.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="茱莉雅．乐芙关于这起和解的文章刊登于《诉讼日报》（Litigation Daily，美国律师媒体的业界通信刊物），引起《财星》（Fortune）杂志法律线记者罗杰．帕洛夫（Roger Parloff）的注意。帕洛夫曾是执业律师，原本在曼哈顿担任白领犯罪（White-collar crime，编按：白领阶级在其职业活动中所从事的犯罪行为）刑事辩护律师，后来才转行当记者，随时在搜罗精彩的法律长篇故事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Underhill responded angrily a few hours later, leaving the reporter off his reply but copying his boss. He denied any attempt to bribe John and warned him that Boies Schiller would hold him responsible if he continued to make such claims.

<div class="line_en">This particular case struck him as strange and, in his experience, strange cases usually made for good yarns. Why had Boies, arguably the country's most famous lawyer with his pick of high-profile cases to choose from, handled this obscure patent trial himself instead of delegating it to a more junior associate? Then there was the fact that John Fuisz, an attorney who was the son of one of the defendants and brother of the other, was publicly threatening to sue both the plaintiff and Boies for making false accusations.</div>

<div class="line_en">From his office in the Time &amp; Life Building in Midtown Manhattan, Parloff picked up the phone and called Dawn Schneider, Boies's longtime public-relations representative. Parloff's call was perfect timing from Schneider's perspective. She had just talked to an ebullient Boies about the case and decided she should try to get him some press about it. She offered to come brief the Fortune writer in person. The Boies Schiller offices at Fifty-First Street and Lexington Avenue were just four avenue blocks away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="帕洛夫坐在曼哈顿中城时代生活大楼（Time &amp; Life，《财星》杂志母公司）的办公室，拿起电话打给唐恩．施奈德（Dawn Schneider），波伊斯长期的公关代表。从施奈德的角度来看，帕洛夫的电话来得正好，她才刚跟热情洋溢版的波伊斯谈过这个案件，决定帮他找些媒体来报导这件诉讼，所以她提议当面去跟这位《财星》杂志记者做演示文稿。BSF事务所位于五十一街，距离莱辛顿大道（Lexington Avenue）只有四个街区。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As she walked across Midtown, it occurred to Schneider that Boies's victory in the Fuisz case was a good story but the far better story was Theranos and its brilliant young founder. She had never met Elizabeth, but she'd been hearing Boies rave about her for several years. This was an opportunity to get David's protégée national attention just as her company prepared to expand across the country. By the time she got to the Fortune offices on Avenue of the Americas, Schneider had changed her pitch.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="步行穿越中城时，施奈德突然想到，波伊斯打赢傅伊兹诉讼是个好故事，不过，Theranos和它那位聪明又年轻的创办人是更精彩的故事。她没看过伊莉莎白本人，但听波伊斯对她赞不绝口已听了好几年，这是让波伊斯的女门徒获得全国知名度的好机会，正好她的公司也准备扩大到全国各地。等到施奈德走到美洲大道（Avenue of the Americas）的《财星》办公室，她要推销的东西已经换了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Parloff listened intrigued. He hadn't seen the Wall Street Journal article from the previous fall so he had never heard of Theranos but, according to Schneider, that was precisely the point.

<div class="line_en">Leaving those quirks aside, what Elizabeth told Parloff she'd achieved seemed genuinely innovative and impressive. As she and Sunny had stated to Partner Fund, she told him the Theranos analyzer could perform as many as seventy different blood tests from one tiny finger-stick draw and she led him to believe that the more than two hundred tests on its menu were all finger-stick tests done with proprietary technology. Since he didn't have the expertise to vet her scientific claims, Parloff interviewed the prominent members of her board of directors and effectively relied on them as character witnesses. He talked to Shultz, Perry, Kissinger, Nunn, Mattis, and to two new directors: Richard Kovacevich, the former CEO of the giant bank Wells Fargo, and former Senate majority leader Bill Frist. Before going into politics, Frist had been a heart and lung transplant surgeon. All of them vouched for Elizabeth emphatically. Shultz and Mattis were particularly effusive.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="撇开那些古怪之处，伊莉莎白口中的成就似乎真的很创新、令人惊艳。如同她和桑尼以前跟伙伴基金讲过的，她也跟帕洛夫说，Theranos这台分析仪可以运行多达七十种不同的血液检测，只需要扎手指取出少少的血液；还有，Theranos提供的两百多种检测，都是透过扎手指取血，再用其独家技术进行。由于没有相关经验可查证她这些科学说法，帕洛夫于是采访了Theranos董事会里那些德高望重的成员，等于是找他们做人格背书。他采访了舒兹、裴瑞、季辛吉、楠恩、马提斯，还有两位新董事：理察．柯瓦希维奇（Richard Kovacevich），银行巨擘「富国银行」（Wells Fargo）前首席执行官，以及前参议院多数党领袖比尔．弗利斯特（Bill Frist，他踏入政坛前是心脏、肺脏移植外科医生），这些人都强力替伊莉莎白挂保证，舒兹和马提斯尤其对她极尽溢美之词。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A few weeks later, Parloff flew out to Palo Alto to meet Elizabeth. Over the course of several days, he interviewed her for a combined seven hours. After getting over his initial shock at her deep voice, he found her smart and engaging. When they broached topics other than blood testing, she was unassuming, almost naïve. But when their conversations shifted to Theranos, she became steely and intense. She was also very controlling with information. She dangled a scoop: Theranos had raised more than $400 million from investors at a valuation of $9 billion, making it one of the most valuable startups in Silicon Valley. And she showed Parloff the miniLab (though she didn't refer to it by any name). But she wouldn't let the magazine take photos of it and she didn't want Parloff to use the words "device" or "machine" to describe it. She preferred "analyzer."</div>

<div class="line_en">Parloff didn't end up using those quotes in his article, but the ringing endorsements he heard in interview after interview from the luminaries on Theranos's board gave him confidence that Elizabeth was the real deal. He also liked to think of himself as a pretty good judge of character. After all, he'd dealt with his share of dishonest people over the years, having worked in a prison during law school and later writing at length about such fraudsters as the carpet-cleaning entrepreneur Barry Minkow and the lawyer Marc Dreier, both of whom went to prison for masterminding Ponzi schemes. Sure, Elizabeth had a secretive streak when it came to discussing certain specifics about her company, but he found her for the most part to be genuine and sincere. Since his angle was no longer the patent case, he didn't bother to reach out to the Fuiszes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="帕洛夫最后并没有把这些话语引述于文章中，不过听到Theranos董事会一个又一个知名人士铿锵有力的背书，让他相信她必定是真材实料。更何况他也自认很会看人，毕竟这么多年来接触够多不老实的人了，念法学院时曾在监狱工作，后来又长期撰写地毯清洁公司创业家贝瑞．敏科（Barry Minkow）、律师马克．缀尔（Marc Dreier）这类骗子——这两人最后都因一手策画庞氏骗局而锒铛入狱（编按：庞氏骗局是以不正常的高额回报骗取投资者加入）。没错，每次他要进一步细究Theranos时，伊莉莎白会给人遮遮掩掩的感觉，但他觉得大体说来她是真诚、发自内心的。既然报导角度不再是专利案件，他就不费事去找傅伊兹父子了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The story disclosed Theranos's valuation for the first time as well as the fact that Elizabeth owned more than half of the company. There was also the now-familiar comparison to Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. This time it came not from George Shultz but from her old Stanford professor Channing Robertson. (Had Parloff read Robertson's testimony in the Fuisz trial, he would have learned that Theranos was paying him $500,000 a year, ostensibly as a consultant.) Parloff also included a passage about Elizabeth's phobia of needles -- a detail that would be repeated over and over in the ensuing flurry of coverage his story unleashed and become central to her myth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="《财星》这篇报导首度披露Theranos的估值，以及伊莉莎白握有该公司过半数股票的事实。同时也出现如今已耳熟能详的比较，把伊莉莎白比喻为贾伯斯和比尔．盖兹，只是这次并非出自乔治．舒兹之口，而是来自伊莉莎白的斯坦福老教授钱宁．罗伯森（要是帕洛夫看过罗伯森在傅伊兹一案的证词，就会知道Theranos以顾问名义一年付他五十万美元）。帕洛夫还把伊莉莎白的针头恐惧写了进去，这段细节会一再重现于后续卷起的一连串报导中，成为伊莉莎白神话的核心。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When Parloff's cover story was published in the June 12, 2014, issue of Fortune, it vaulted Elizabeth to instant stardom. Her Journal interview had gotten some notice and there had also been a piece in Wired, but there was nothing like a magazine cover to grab people's attention.

Two months later, she graced one of the covers of the magazine's annual Forbes 400 issue on the richest people in America.

Her emergence tapped into the public's hunger to see a female entrepreneur break through in a technology world dominated by men.

In Elizabeth Holmes, the Valley had its first female billionaire tech founder.</div>

<div class="line_en">Elizabeth was also quick to embrace the trappings of fame. The Theranos security team grew to twenty people. Two bodyguards now drove her around in a black Audi A8 sedan. Their code name for her was "Eagle One." (Sunny was "Eagle Two.") The Audi had no license plates -- another nod to Steve Jobs, who used to lease a new Mercedes every six months to avoid having plates. Elizabeth also had a personal chef who prepared her salads and green vegetable juices made of cucumber, parsley, kale, spinach, lettuce, and celery. And when she had to fly somewhere, it was in a private Gulfstream jet.</div>

<div class="line_en">Still, there was something unusual in the way Elizabeth embraced the limelight. She behaved more like a movie star than an entrepreneur, basking in the public adulation she was receiving. Each week brought a new media interview or conference appearance. Other well-known startup founders gave interviews and made public appearances too but with nowhere near the same frequency. The image of the reclusive, ascetic young woman Parloff had been sold on had overnight given way to that of the ubiquitous celebrity.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was true that Elizabeth's uncle, Ron Dietz, had died eighteen months earlier from skin cancer that had metastasized and spread to his brain. But what she omitted to disclose was that she had never been close to him. To family members who knew the reality of their relationship, using his death to promote her company felt phony and exploitative. Of course, no one in the audience at San Francisco's Palace of Fine Arts knew this. Most of the one thousand spectators in attendance found her performance mesmerizing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一年半前，伊莉莎白的姨丈朗．帝兹确实因皮肤癌扩散到大脑而过世，但她没讲的是，她跟姨丈从来就不亲。对熟知他们关系的亲戚家属而言，利用姨丈之死来推销自己的公司很虚伪，而且占人便宜。当然，旧金山艺术宫（Palace of Fine Arts）的现场群众并不知情，那一千多人大多只被她的表演迷住了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Part of what made Elizabeth's persona so compelling was her heartwarming message about using Theranos's convenient blood tests to catch diseases early so that, as she put it in interview after interview, no one would have to say goodbye to loved ones too soon. In September 2014, three months after the Fortune cover story, she made that message more poignant during a speech at the TEDMED conference in San Francisco by adding a personal dimension to it: for the first time, she told the story in public of her uncle who had died of cancer -- the same story Tyler Shultz had found so inspiring when he'd started working at Theranos.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="伊莉莎白的形象之所以如此打动人心，部分要归功于她所传达的暖心诉求：Theranos方便的血液检测可以提早侦测出疾病，因此，（如同她在一次又一次的专访所说）没有人必须被迫提早跟挚爱说再见。二〇一四年九月，《财星》那篇封面故事刊出三个月后，旧金山一场TEDMED会议上，伊莉莎白在演说中把那个诉求说得更深刻酸楚，因为她加入了个人亲身经验：第一次公开讲述姨丈死于癌症的故事，也就是泰勒．舒兹刚进入Theranos觉得非常激励人心的故事。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">One of the people watching from a seat halfway up the auditorium was Patrick O'Neill, whom Elizabeth had hired away from TBWAChiatDay and appointed Theranos's chief creative officer. Patrick had become instrumental in honing Elizabeth's image and raising her profile. He had helped her prepare for the conference and before that had worked with Fortune's photographer on the magazine's cover shoot. To Patrick, making Elizabeth the face of Theranos made perfect sense. She was the company's most powerful marketing tool. Her story was intoxicating. Everyone wanted to believe in it, including the numerous young girls who were sending her letters and emails. It wasn't a cynical calculus on his part: Patrick was one of her biggest believers. He had no knowledge of the shenanigans in the lab and didn't pretend to understand the science of blood testing. As far as he was concerned, the fairy tale was real.</div>

<div class="line_en">Clad all in black, she strode solemnly around the stage as she spoke, like a preacher giving a sermon. In a stunt that made for brilliant theater, she pulled a nanotainer out of her jacket pocket midway through and held it up to illustrate how little blood Theranos's tests required. Calling the fear of needles "one of the basic human fears, up there with the fear of spiders and the fear of heights," she then told other touching anecdotes. One was about a little girl who got stuck repeatedly with a syringe by a hospital nurse who couldn't find her vein. Another was about cancer patients whose spirits were broken by all the blood they had to give as part of their treatments.</div>

Desks were arranged in large circular patterns rippling out from circular glass conference rooms in the center. The carpeting followed the same circular patterns. In the building's lobby, interlocking rings of brass were embedded in the floor's terrazzo tiles to form the Flower of Life symbol. Elizabeth's new corner office was designed to look like the Oval Office. Patrick ordered a custom-made desk that was as deep as the president's at its center but had rounded edges. In front of it, he arranged two sofas and two armchairs around a table, replicating the White House layout. At Elizabeth's insistence, the office's big windows were made of bulletproof glass.</div>

<div class="line_en">Patrick wasn't just Elizabeth's style and décor consultant. He also spearheaded a big marketing push Theranos was making in Arizona, where its wellness centers had expanded to forty Walgreens stores. He hired Errol Morris, an Academy Award-winning documentary filmmaker who moonlighted as a producer and director of commercials, to make video ads the company ran on TV stations in the Phoenix area and on its website and YouTube channel. One of the spots was a close-up of Elizabeth in her customary black turtleneck staring into the camera and talking about what she called people's "basic human right" to access their own health information through blood tests.

<div class="line_en">Another spot featured patients complaining about how much they hated big needles and then acting pleased at the painlessness of the Theranos experience as they got their fingers pricked. Patrick thought it was powerful and arranged for it to run during shows with high female viewership, like the ABC drama Scandal, because research had shown that mothers were households' medical decision makers. But the ad had to be pulled a couple of weeks after it started airing because a local doctor complained that some of his patients had gone to Walgreens stores expecting a finger-stick draw only to be told their tests required a needle after all. Patrick was disappointed but didn't raise a fuss about it because he knew this was a sensitive subject.</div>
