<div class="line_en">A young girl walked to the witness stand. As she raised her hand and swore that the evidence she gave would be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth so help her God, she seemed somehow fragile-looking, but when she sat facing us in the witness chair she became what she was, a thick-bodied girl accustomed to strenuous labor.</div>

<div class="line_en">In Maycomb County, it was easy to tell when someone bathed regularly, as opposed to yearly lavations: Mr. Ewell had a scalded look; as if an overnight soaking had deprived him of protective layers of dirt, his skin appeared to be sensitive to the elements. Mayella looked as if she tried to keep clean, and I was reminded of the row of red geraniums in the Ewell yard.</div>

<div class="line_en">Slowly but surely I began to see the pattern of Atticus's questions: from questions that Mr. Gilmer did not deem sufficiently irrelevant or immaterial to object to, Atticus was quietly building up before the jury a picture of the Ewells' home life. The jury learned the following things: their relief check was far from enough to feed the family, and there was strong suspicion that Papa drank it up anyway -- he sometimes went off in the swamp for days and came home sick; the weather was seldom cold enough to require shoes, but when it was, you could make dandy ones from strips of old tires; the family hauled its water in buckets from a spring that ran out at one end of the dump -- they kept the surrounding area clear of trash -- and it was everybody for himself as far as keeping clean went: if you wanted to wash you hauled your own water; the younger children had perpetual colds and suffered from chronic ground-itch; there was a lady who came around sometimes and asked Mayella why she didn't stay in school -- she wrote down the answer; with two members of the family reading and writing, there was no need for the rest of them to learn -- Papa needed them at home.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我一点一点地，但越来越清楚地开始看出阿迪克斯这样提问的用意。从吉尔默先生认为离题和没有意义而表示反对的问题起，阿迪克斯正悄悄地在陪审团的眼前把尤厄尔家的生活构成一个画面。陪审团了解到下边一些情况：靠救济金她家吃不饱，人们非常怀疑是尤厄尔先生喝酒把救济金喝光了……他有时一连几天在沼泽地里，回来就病倒了；天气很少冷到需要鞋子，就是天气真的冷了，他也可以用破轮胎制出上等的高级鞋来；这个家用桶从垃圾场的一头冒出的泉水里挑水——他们把泉水附近的垃圾清理干净了——说到爱干净则各人随各人的便：要想洗什么你就自己担自己的水，年纪小点儿的孩子终年感冒，而且患有难治的皮肤病。有个女人不时到她家附近来，问梅耶拉为什么不继续念书——她把答案写给了她：家里有两个人能读书写字，不需要其他人去学习了——她爸爸需要他们留在家里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then she burst into real tears. Her shoulders shook with angry sobs. She was as good as her word. She answered no more questions, even when Mr. Gilmer tried to get her back on the track. I guess if she hadn't been so poor and ignorant, Judge Taylor would have put her under the jail for the contempt she had shown everybody in the courtroom. Somehow, Atticus had hit her hard in a way that was not clear to me, but it gave him no pleasure to do so. He sat with his head down, and I never saw anybody glare at anyone with the hatred Mayella showed when she left the stand and walked by Atticus's table.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着，她真哭了起来，肩膀随着气愤的抽泣不停地耸着。她真的说到做到，再没回答问题了。就是吉尔默先生想让她重新开口也没用。我猜，要不是她又穷又无知的话，泰勒法官肯定会因为她藐视法庭所有的人而把她送进监狱。不知怎的，阿迪克斯用了一种我不明白的方法伤了她的心。但他自己也并不愿意这样做。他耷拉着脑袋坐着。我从没见过任何人盯着别人时像梅耶拉离开证人席从阿迪克斯桌前走过时限睛里射出的那种强烈的仇视。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Atticus and Mr. Gilmer met in front of the bench and whispered, then they left the courtroom by a door behind the witness stand, which was a signal for us all to stretch. I discovered that I had been sitting on the edge of the long bench, and I was somewhat numb. Jem got up and yawned, Dill did likewise, and Reverend Sykes wiped his face on his hat. The temperature was an easy ninety, he said.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mr. Braxton Underwood, who had been sitting quietly in a chair reserved for the Press, soaking up testimony with his sponge of a brain, allowed his bitter eyes to rove over the colored balcony, and they met mine. He gave a snort and looked away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布拉克斯顿·安德伍德先生在这以前一直安安静静地坐在一张专供记者用的椅子上，用他那什么都装得进的脑袋，海绵吸水般地把证词都吸了进去。这会儿，他那含着敌意的眼光往黑人楼厅上转了转，正碰上我的目光。他轻蔑地哼了一声便掉过头去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That's okay. He won't tell Atticus, he'll just put it on the social side of the Tribune." Jem turned back to Dill, explaining, I suppose, the finer points of the trial to him, but I wondered what they were. There had been no lengthy debates between Atticus and Mr. Gilmer on any points; Mr. Gilmer seemed to be prosecuting almost reluctantly; witnesses had been led by the nose as asses are, with few objections. But Atticus had once told us that in Judge Taylor's court any lawyer who was a strict constructionist on evidence usually wound up receiving strict instructions from the bench. He distilled this for me to mean that Judge Taylor might look lazy and operate in his sleep, but he was seldom reversed, and that was the proof of the pudding. Atticus said he was a good judge.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没关系，他不会告诉阿迪克斯，他只不过会在《梅科姆论坛报》的社会专栏里登上一条新闻。”杰姆对迪尔转过身，向他解释着，我猜是解释着有关审判的其他问题。但我不知道是些什么。阿迪克斯和吉尔默先生之间没就任何问题进行长时间的辩论}吉尔默先生好像是在勉勉强强地起诉，证人像驴子一样被牵着鼻子走，很少提出反对意见。不过，阿迪克斯对我说过，在泰勒法官的审判厅里，一个只会死死扣住证据作出解释的律师，通常要受到泰勒法官的严厉指责。他的意思概括起来就是，泰勒法官也许看上去懒洋洋的，似乎一边睡觉一边审判，但他的判决很少被上级法院推翻。这最能说明问题了。阿迪克斯说他是一个很不错的法官。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As a rule, a recess meant a general exodus, but today people weren't moving. Even the Idlers who had failed to shame younger men from their seats had remained standing along the walls. I guess Mr. Heck Tate had reserved the county toilet for court officials.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="通常，一到休庭，就意味着大批人离去。可是今天谁也没有走动一下。甚至那些“闲人俱乐部”的人也靠着墙没动，坐在位子上的年轻人也没顾礼貌，谁也没有给他们让座。我想，赫克·塔特先生把县政府里的厕所都留给法院的官员们用了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Atticus and Mr. Gilmer returned, and Judge Taylor looked at his watch. "It's gettin' on to four," he said, which was intriguing, as the courthouse clock must have struck the hour at least twice. I had not heard it or felt its vibrations.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿迪克斯和吉尔默先生回到审判厅来了，泰勒法官看了看表。“快四点了，”他说。这倒真有意思。法院钟楼里的钟一定至少报过两次时了，我没听到钟响，也没感觉到钟摆的震动。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Presently Judge Taylor returned and climbed into his swivel chair. He took a cigar from his vest pocket and examined it thoughtfully. I punched Dill. Having passed the judge's inspection, the cigar suffered a vicious bite. "We come down sometimes to watch him," I explained. "It's gonna take him the rest of the afternoon, now. You watch." Unaware of public scrutiny from above, Judge Taylor disposed of the severed end by propelling it expertly to his lips and saying, "Fhluck!" He hit a spittoon so squarely we could hear it slosh. "Bet he was hell with a spitball," murmured Dill.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没过多久，泰勒法官回来了，又爬进了他的转椅。他从背心口袋里掏出一支雪茄，若有所思地把雪茄察看了一下。我碰了一下迪尔。那雪茄经过察看后，就被法官扎扎实实地嚼起来了。“我们有时特意看他嚼烟，”我解释说，“这一下午剩下的时间他会嚼个不停的。你等着瞧吧！”泰勒法官不知道头上有人注视着他，把雪茄烟头一口咬断，熟练地移到嘴唇边，“呸”的一声吐出去，恰恰吐进一个痰盂里，连里面水的泼溅声我们都听到了。“我想，用唾液弄湿纸团子吐到别人身上，一定是他过去的拿手好戏。”迪尔悄悄说了一句。">查看中文翻译</div>
