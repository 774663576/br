<div class="line_en">"I have never met so much suffering, joined to such perfect beauty and such a clever mind," he told Eleanor as they drove home in the archdeacon's carriage.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我从没受过这么大的折磨，跟这样一个美若天仙、冰雪聪明的人相处。”坐执事长的马车回家的时候，他对埃莉诺说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There had also been a dinner party at the Stanhopes', to which Mrs Bold and Mr Arabin were invited. He, like every other man before him, could not resist the charming signora, and spent the whole evening beside her sofa.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接下来，斯坦诺普家也办了一场晚宴，邀请了博尔德太太和阿拉宾先生。跟之前的那些男人一样，阿拉宾先生也无法抗拒内罗尼太太的魅力，整晚都守在她的沙发旁。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The next two weeks passed very pleasantly at Plumstead. Eleanor was a delightful house-guest, and Dr and Mrs Grantly seemed to have forgotten her wicked feelings for Mr Slope. Mr Harding walked in the garden and played the piano, and little Johnny had no more trouble with his teeth. And although Mr Arabin was busy with his new duties at St Ewold's, he made sure he spent every evening at Plumstead.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接下来两个星期，在普拉姆斯特德的日子过得十分愉快。埃莉诺是个讨人喜欢的客人，格兰特利博士夫妇则似乎已经忘记了她对斯洛普先生的孽情。哈丁先生在花园里散步，弹钢琴，小约翰尼的牙也不疼了。阿拉宾先生在圣埃沃兹履新后，公务缠身，却也总会抽出时间，每晚都在普拉姆斯特德度过。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Eleanor by no means liked to hear this praise. It was, however, extremely unjust of her to be angry with Mr Arabin, as she had herself spent a very pleasant evening with Bertie Stanhope, who had not left her side for one moment. She was not in love with Mr Arabin, although she had spent three weeks in the same house as him and they had enjoyed lengthy conversations together. But a woman does not need to be in love to be irritated when a friend or companion appears to find another woman more attractive. "I thought he had more wisdom than that," she told herself, as she sat watching her sleeping child, after they had arrived home. "After all, I believe Mr Stanhope is the pleasanter man of the two."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃莉诺绝不想听到这样的赞美之词。不过，她要是为此生阿拉宾先生的气就太不公平，因为她自己也和伯蒂·斯坦诺普度过了十分愉快的一个夜晚，伯蒂对她寸步不离。她并没有爱上阿拉宾先生，尽管他俩在同一个屋檐下生活了三个星期，还曾多次愉快地长谈。可是，如果哪个女人的朋友或同伴似乎觉得别的女人更有魅力，这个女人自然会气恼，不一定非要爱上了这个朋友或同伴。“我还以为他不至于那么肤浅呢。”回到家后，她坐下来看自己熟睡的孩子，心里说，“说到底，还是斯坦诺普先生比阿拉宾先生更招人喜欢。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So things went on at Plumstead. However, the matter of the wardenship was still not decided. Following his promise to Mr Harding, the archdeacon had tried to speak privately to the bishop about it, but had not been able to see him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="普拉姆斯特德的生活还在继续。然而，院长职位的问题仍然没有定论。执事长遵守对哈丁先生的诺言，一直在找机会跟主教私下聊聊这件事，只是还没能见到他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Fortunately, Eleanor's annoyance with Mr Arabin did not last long, and soon they were good friends again. They could have been more, if he had respected her intelligence enough to discuss serious matters with her, as he had done in their first real conversation together. With her he was always gently playful. If he had allowed her to share his deepest thoughts and concerns, she might have learnt to love him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="还好，埃莉诺对阿拉宾先生没有生太久闷气，没多久他俩又成了好朋友。要是他足够尊重她的头脑，能像两人第一次真正交谈的时候那样，跟她讨论严肃的问题，那他俩的关系还会更进一步。跟她在一起的时候，他总是既温和又风趣。要是他跟她分享内心最深处的想法和担忧，那她倒有可能爱上他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mr Arabin was not in love, either. Nor was Bertie Stanhope, although he was ready to say so. Only the widow's cap which Eleanor still wore prevented him, in case it was thought too soon for a widow to be receiving another proposal of marriage.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿拉宾先生也没有爱上谁。伯蒂·斯坦诺普也是，尽管他打算示爱。只不过，埃莉诺头上戴的寡妇帽子让他打了退堂鼓，他怕别人认为，一个寡妇这么快就又接受一次求婚。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Luckily, Mr Harding had another friend fighting his battle for him, a friend even more powerful than the archdeacon, and this was Mr Slope. The chaplain thought he had more and more evidence every day to make him believe the widow would accept his marriage proposal. He felt that giving Mr Harding the wardenship would make him, Slope, more likely to be welcomed as a son-in-law. And he had an even stronger reason for his actions. He wanted a wife, and he wanted money, but he wanted power more than either. He had realized he must fight Mrs Proudie, otherwise he would never be able to rise to a higher position. The wardenship was an excellent reason for war.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="幸运的是，还有一位朋友在帮哈丁先生争取，而且是一位权力比执事长还大的朋友——斯洛普先生。这位特遣牧师认为，相关的证据与日俱增，足以让他相信寡妇会接受他的求婚。他觉得，如果把院长一职给哈丁先生，他斯洛普就更有可能以女婿的身份得到认可。除此以外，他这么做还有一个更有力的理由。他想娶妻室，也想要滚滚钱财，可他更渴望权力。他已经意识到，自己必须对付普劳蒂太太，否则永远无法平步青云。院长职位便是一个绝佳的开战理由。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The bishop, following his wife's orders, had declared Mr Quiverful should be the new warden. So Mr Slope decided to ride over to Puddingdale and interview the vicar at once.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="主教遵从妻命，已经公开宣称新任院长由奎沃夫先生担任。于是，斯洛普先生决定立即骑马前往帕丁戴尔，跟这位代牧当面谈谈。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mr Quiverful was, on the whole, a good, honest, hardworking man, but the difficulties of his daily life had had a bad effect on his spirit and his sense of honour. He was attempting to bring up fourteen children as ladies and gentlemen, on an income which was hardly enough to provide them with food and clothes. He was anxious for bread and meat and anxious to pay his bills, but not as anxious as a richer man might be, to be well respected by all around him. He could not afford such a luxury. Recently he had felt that his brother clergymen, men he had known for twenty years, looked coldly on him since he had shown himself willing to sit at the feet of Mr Slope. He had seen their looks grow colder still, when it was said he was to become the new warden. This was painful to him, but when he thought of his poor wife and children, and the happy, comfortable life they would all have in the warden's house in Barchester, he felt he had no choice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="总体上说，奎沃夫先生是个好心、善良、兢兢业业的人，然而，生活的艰辛侵蚀了他的精神和荣誉感。他正在努力把十四个孩子培养成绅士淑女，可收入几乎供不上他们吃饭穿衣。他急于填饱一家人的肚子，急于付清账单，但不像富人那样，急于得到身边所有人的尊重。那样的奢侈他消费不起。近些日子他有一种感觉，自从他表示愿意追随斯洛普先生之后，相识二十年的兄弟神职人员开始对他冷眼相看。等到传言说他将担任新任院长，他还看到了更加冰冷的目光。他痛苦不堪，可是，想到自己可怜的妻儿，想到一家子都能在巴彻斯特的院长住所享受快乐舒坦的日子，他觉得自己别无选择。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So when she saw the great Mr Slope arrive, she hurried into the kitchen with an anxious, beating heart, and left the two men alone in the sitting room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因此，看到了不起的斯洛普先生大驾光临，她便揣着一颗怦怦乱跳的心匆匆躲进厨房，把两个男人单独留在会客厅里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mrs Quiverful cared nothing for the frowns of the clergy. In her heart she had no other ambition than that of seeing her husband and children properly fed and dressed -- life for her had no other purpose. So she had no patience with her husband when he had spoken of not wishing to accept the post until he was sure Mr Harding had refused it. Fortunately, they had now received a full promise that the post was theirs, not only from Mr Slope, but also from Mrs Proudie. But what if all had been lost? Mrs Quiverful was a happy woman at present, but it took her breath away when she thought of the danger they had been in.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对于神职人员的横眉冷对，奎沃夫太太毫不在意。她一心所想，就是丈夫和孩子们衣食无忧——对她来说，生活的目的仅此而已。因此，她对自己的丈夫很不满意，因为丈夫说，除非他确信哈丁先生已拒绝担任院长，否则不会接受这个职位。幸运的是，如今他们已经得到了百分之百的保证，这个职位会花落他家，而且说这话的不光是斯洛普先生，还有普劳蒂太太。然而，要是这一切都落了空呢？就眼下来说，奎沃夫太太很快乐，可是，一想到家人所处的险境，她就觉得喘不过气来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was easy for a man as experienced as Mr Slope to achieve his purpose. By choosing his words carefully, he was able to withdraw the promise he had made to Quiverful, who, although horrified at the thought of losing the post, could do nothing but express his disappointment. Soon Mr Slope was riding back to Barchester, confident that he could now persuade the bishop to give the post to Mr Harding.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯洛普先生经验如此老到，自然可以轻而易举地达到目的。他字斟句酌，成功地收回了先前对奎沃夫的承诺。想到职位不保，奎沃夫心中十分恐惧，可他也只能表达自己的失望之情而已。没过多久，斯洛普先生就骑马回巴彻斯特了。他相信他现在能够说服主教，把这个职位授予哈丁先生。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But she could not persuade her husband to take any action at all, and soon she realized she must do something herself. "What if, after all, Mrs Proudie knows nothing of Mr Slope's visit?" she thought. She decided to call on the bishop's wife immediately.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而她没法说服丈夫采取任何行动，她很快就意识到自己必须亲自出马。她心里想：“说到底，万一普劳蒂太太根本不知道斯洛普先生来这儿的事情呢？”她决定马上去拜见主教的妻子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mrs Proudie was in an excellent mood, having just triumphed in another battle. The bishop had received an invitation to spend a couple of days with the archbishop, and greatly desired to accept it. However, not a word in the invitation mentioned Mrs Proudie, so if the bishop went at all, he must go alone. This presented an enormous difficulty. He could not order his bags to be packed, and then simply set off with a servant, casually telling the lady of his heart that he would be back on Saturday. There are men -- probably very wicked men -- who do such things, and there are women -- more like slaves -- who put up with them. But Dr and Mrs Proudie were not among them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="普劳蒂太太心情不错，因为她刚刚在另一场斗争中大获全胜。这之前，主教收到了一封请柬，请他去大主教那里盘桓几日，而他也很想接受邀约。然而，请柬当中只字未提普劳蒂太太，主教要去的话，就只能一个人去。这就造成了极大的困难。他没法叫人替他备好行李，然后只带上一个仆人出发，漫不经心地告诉心爱的太太，自己星期六回来。世上倒真有些男人——多半是坏透了的男人——会这么做，也真有些女人——像奴隶一样的女人——会容忍他们。不过，普劳蒂博士可不是这样的男人，普劳蒂太太也不是这样的女人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Normally, a visit to the bishop's palace would make her very nervous -- she was only a country vicar's wife -- but this time, strengthened by her family's needs, she felt confident. She arranged for a local farmer to drive her into Barchester and wait for her, to bring her back. Finally, she took her last half-crown coin from the box where she kept her savings; she would need it to bribe the servants to let her see the lady of the house.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="换作平时，去主教的宅邸会让她万分紧张——毕竟她不过是一个乡下代牧的妻子——然而这一次，她因为家里不得已的缘故，斗志昂扬，满怀自信。她安排一个当地的农夫赶车送她去巴彻斯特，然后再等着送她回来。最后，她把仅存的一枚半克朗硬币从平时存钱的盒子里拿了出来。她得拿这个买通那些仆人，让他们放她进去见宅邸的女主人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She arrived at the palace door, and was told Mrs Proudie was not at home. "I must see her," said Mrs Quiverful firmly, and pressed her half-crown into the servant's hand. In two minutes she was in Mrs Proudie's sitting room, telling her sad story.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她来到宅邸门口，被告知普劳蒂太太不在家。“我一定要见她。”奎沃夫太太坚决地说，把那块半克朗硬币塞到了仆人手里。两分钟之后，她已经进了普劳蒂太太的会客厅，开始给太太讲自己的伤心事了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Now, therefore, she was all smiles as she greeted Mrs Quiverful. But her expression became cold and stern when she heard what Mr Slope had done. Asking Mrs Quiverful to wait for her, she marched out of the room. She was extremely angry with her husband, who, as she thought, had broken the promise he had so clearly given her about the hospital, and she was determined to win the battle against him all over again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所以，此刻她满脸堆笑地问候奎沃夫太太。不过，一听说斯洛普先生的所作所为，她的表情立刻变得既冰冷又严厉。她让奎沃夫太太等着她，然后大步流星地走出了房间。她对丈夫火冒三丈，因为照她的理解，丈夫已经明明白白地答应了她养老院的事，现在却赖了账。她打定了主意，要再斗赢他一次。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Without knocking at the door, she walked quickly into the bishop's study. She found him seated there, with Mr Slope opposite him. Between Dr Proudie's fingers was the very note which he had written to the archbishop in her presence -- and it was open! Yes, he had dared to break open the seal which she herself had approved. It was only too clear that the two guilty men were discussing the invitation, even after the matter had already been decided by her! Mr Slope rose from his chair and bowed slightly. He and Mrs Proudie looked each other full in the face, and knew each was face to face with an enemy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她连门都没敲，就快步走进了主教的书房。她看见主教坐在书房里，对面坐着斯洛普先生。普劳蒂博士手上拿着他当着她的面写给大主教的那封信——信已经拆了封！没错，他居然胆大包天地拆开了她亲自批准的封印。很显然，这两个罪人正在商量请柬的事情，哪怕这事情已经由她拍了板！斯洛普先生站起身来，向她微微鞠了一躬。他和普劳蒂太太四目相对，两人心里都明白自己面对着一个敌人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So the bishop had spoken to his wife, but it was a short discussion. Those who are married will understand very well how the battle was lost and won; those who are single will never understand it until they learn the lesson which experience alone can give. Mrs Proudie made sure that before she left her lord, she had seen the answer to the invitation written and sealed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因此，尽管主教跟妻子提了这事，却只是简单说了几句。结了婚的人都容易理解，这样的斗争是如何拼出了输赢。没结过婚的人只有亲身经历才能理解。以防万一，普劳蒂太太亲眼看着写好的回信装进了信封，才离开她的主教大人。">查看中文翻译</div>

The bishop was sitting in his armchair, turning his eyes now to his wife, and now to his chaplain, as each went on the attack in turn. How comfortable it would be if they could fight it out between them, so that one should destroy the other, and then he, the bishop, would know whom to obey!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="屋子里一片死寂。斯洛普先生站着，一只手扶着椅背，一脸严肃，还带着浓重的威胁意味。普劳蒂太太站在桌子的一头，一边说话，一边像男人那样用力拍桌子。主教坐在扶手椅上，随着交锋双方轮流上阵，一会儿看看妻子，一会儿又看看自己的特遣牧师。要是他俩能决出胜负，一方能彻底摧垮另一方，好让他这个主教，知道该听命于谁，那有多舒心啊！">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“斯洛普先生，”她慢悠悠、不慌不忙地说，“麻烦你，请你离开这个房间。我想跟我的主教大人单独谈谈。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">What dreadful words these were to Mrs Proudie's ears! It was evident that the bishop was rebelling against her, and she must move speedily to regain control.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在普劳蒂太太听来，这样的话多么刺耳！显而易见，主教这是在跟她造反，因此她必须迅速行动，重新控制局面。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mr Slope also felt that everything depended on the present interview. If the bishop lost this battle, he would remain a slave for ever. Now was the moment for victory or defeat!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯洛普先生也已经意识到，一切都取决于眼前这场谈话。如果主教输了，自己就永远摆脱不了奴仆的地位。决定胜负的关键时刻到了！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"His lordship asked me here to discuss important cathedral business," he replied, hoping for support from Dr Proudie. "My leaving him at the moment is, I fear, impossible."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“主教大人叫我到这儿来跟他商议教堂里的要事。”他回答，希望普劳蒂博士能给他点支持。“要我在这个时候离开，恐怕我做不到。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Ungrateful man!" cried Mrs Proudie. "My lord, will you kindly beg Mr Slope to leave the room?"</div>

<div class="line_en">My lord scratched his head, but said nothing. This was as much support as Mr Slope had expected.</div>

<div class="line_en">"My lord," said the lady, "is Mr Slope to leave this room, or am I?" Here Mrs Proudie made a false step. She should not have mentioned the possibility of withdrawing from the battlefield. In answer to such a question, the bishop naturally said to himself that, as it was necessary for one of them to leave the room, perhaps it might as well be Mrs Proudie. But he still said nothing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我的主教大人，”太太说，“是斯洛普先生离开这个房间呢，还是我走？”这步棋她算是走错了，因为她不该主动提出撤离战场这个可能性。面对这样的一个问题，主教自然开始在心里琢磨，既然这两个人当中总得有一个走，或许还是自己的太太离开为好。不过，他还是一声不吭。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mrs Proudie's anger was boiling over. She could not keep her temper as her enemy did, and so she was defeated.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="普劳蒂太太气得七窍生烟。她没有对手那种控制情绪的本事，于是败下阵来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mr Slope saw at once how much he had gained, and turned a triumphant look on the lady. Here he was wrong. He should have looked humbly at her, and remembered that this victory would not last long. He could not arrange to divorce the bishop from his wife, he could not be present every moment of the day, he could not interfere in the privacy of the bedroom, when the wife wished "to speak to my lord alone".</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯洛普先生立刻看到了自己的战果，还得意扬扬地看了普劳蒂太太一眼。他不该这么做。他应该谦逊地看她一眼，还应该明白这场胜利维持不了多久。他既不可能安排主教跟妻子离婚，也不可能成天守在这里，更不可能在主教太太在卧房里想“跟我的主教大人单独谈谈”的时候破门而入。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But for the moment his triumph was complete, and Mrs Proudie left the room. Now the chaplain told the bishop, in plain words, that he must not let his wife interfere in future, and Dr Proudie, after some hesitation, agreed. Like a good child, the bishop received an immediate reward -- he was instructed to write another note to the archbishop, this time accepting the invitation. Mr Slope, more careful than the lady, put the note safely in his pocket. He also persuaded the bishop to see Mr Harding, with the intention of offering him the wardenship. And so Mr Slope, far from disappointed with his achievements, left the palace and posted the note with his own hands.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，他暂时算是大获全胜，普劳蒂太太走出了房间。现在，特遣牧师不再耍花腔，告诉主教，从今往后，再不能让他的妻子指手画脚。稍作迟疑之后，普劳蒂博士表示了同意。跟表现好的孩子一样，主教立刻得到了奖赏——在特遣牧师的指导下，他重新给大主教写了一封信，这一次是接受邀约。斯洛普先生比普劳蒂太太还要小心，把回信稳妥地装进了自己的口袋。他还劝服主教去见见哈丁先生，把院长一职委任于他。这之后，斯洛普先生志得意满地离开了主教的宅邸，亲手把回信寄了出去。">查看中文翻译</div>
