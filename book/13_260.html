<div class="line_en">Before long he was walking with Gandalf once more down the cold corridor to the door of the Tower Hall. There Denethor sat in a grey gloom, like an old patient spider, Pippin thought; he did not seem to have moved since the day before. He beckoned Gandalf to a seat, but Pippin was left for a while standing unheeded. Presently the old man turned to him:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不久之后，他就和甘道夫再度走入那个冰冷的长廊，前往高塔的大厅。迪耐瑟坐在灰蒙蒙的房间中；皮聘觉得他好像是一只耐心的蜘蛛坐在那边，等着猎物上门，他似乎从前一天起就没有移动。他示意甘道夫在旁边坐下来，但皮聘有一段时间站在那边没有人理；后来，老人才对皮聘比了个手势。">查看中文翻译</div>

You shall wait on me, bear errands, and talk to me, if war and council leave me any leisure. Can you sing?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我会的，不过我必须先知道你到底适合做什么，”迪耐瑟说：“如果我把你留在身边，或许我很快就可以知道。我的贴身侍卫之前请求要加入城中的守军，你可以暂时取代他的地位。你可以服侍我、替我传令，如果在这场战争和会议中我还有任何的闲暇，你可以陪我聊天。你会唱歌吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes," said Pippin. "Well, yes, well enough for my own people. But we have no songs fit for great halls and evil times, lord.

<div class="line_en">Presently Denethor waved to Pippin and dismissed him again for a while. "Go to the armouries of the Citadel," he said, "and get you there the livery and gear of the Tower. It will be ready. It was commanded yesterday. Return when you are clad!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时，迪耐瑟挥挥手，示意皮聘暂时离开。“去要塞的兵器库，”他说：“穿上净白塔的制服和装备。我昨天就已经下令了，今天应该已经准备好了，等你穿好之后就赶快回来！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“这些歌为什么不适合这个时刻，或是不适合我的宫殿呢？我们已经在魔影之下生活得够久了，当然想要听听不受魔王威胁的故事。这样一来，即使人们不知道我们在背后的付出，我们还是不会觉得自己的牺牲和努力是徒劳无功的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Pippin's heart sank. He did not relish the idea of singing any song of the Shire to the Lord of Minas Tirith, certainly not the comic ones that he knew best; they were too, well, rustic for such an occasion. He was however spared the ordeal for the present. He was not commanded to sing. Denethor turned to Gandalf, asking questions about the Rohirrim and their policies, and the position of Éomer, the king's nephew. Pippin marvelled at the amount that the Lord seemed to know about a people that lived far away, though it must, he thought, be many years since Denethor himself had ridden abroad.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="皮聘觉得一颗心往下沉，他实在无法想像对着米那斯提力斯的城主唱夏尔的民谣会是什么景象，特别是那些他最熟悉的搞笑歌曲，这些歌曲也同样的不适合眼前的景况。不过，现在他暂时不须要考虑这两难的处境，摄政王并没有命令他当场唱歌。事实上，迪耐瑟将注意力转向甘道夫，询问有关洛汗国的消息和他们的处境，以及伊欧墨的状况。城主对于这个居住在远方的民族所知甚详，让皮聘觉得非常佩服。而且，他想，迪耐瑟一定已经很久没有离开过这座城市了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was dark and dim all day. From the sunless dawn until evening the heavy shadow had deepened, and all hearts in the City were oppressed. Far above a great cloud streamed slowly westward from the Black Land, devouring light, borne upon a wind of war; but below the air was still and breathless, as if all the Vale of Anduin waited for the onset of a ruinous storm.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="整天又黑又暗。从没有阳光的黎明到傍晚，沉重的阴影加深了，城里所有的人都感到压抑。远处，一大片乌云从黑土地上缓缓向西流淌，吞噬着战争之风带来的光明；但下面的空气是静止的，气喘吁吁的，仿佛整个安杜因山谷都在等待毁灭性风暴的来临。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was as he said; and Pippin soon found himself arrayed in strange garments, all of black and silver. He had a small hauberk, its rings forged of steel, maybe, yet black as jet; and a high-crowned helm with small raven-wings on either side, set with a silver star in the centre of the circlet. Above the mail was a short surcoat of black, but broidered on the breast in silver with the token of the Tree. His old clothes were folded and put away, but he was permitted to keep the grey cloak of Lórien, though not to wear it when on duty. He looked now, had he known it, verily Ernil i Pheriannath, the Prince of the Halflings, that folk had called him; but he felt uncomfortable. And the gloom began to weigh on his spirits.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="果然如同摄政王所说的一样，皮聘很快地就穿上了非常独特的制服，只有黑银两色。他披上一件合身的锁子甲，或许上面的环甲是钢铁铸造的，但却黑得如同墨水一般。他还收到一顶相当高的头盔，两边装饰着小小的乌鸦翅膀，中间有颗银色的星星。在锁子甲之外则是一件黑色的斗篷，胸前用银线绣着圣树的徽记。他的旧衣服被叠得很整齐，收到一旁去，但他还是可以保留罗瑞安的灰色斗篷，只是在值勤的时候不能够穿着它。如果他有镜子的话，他会发觉自己现在看起来真的非常ErnilIPheiannath，非常像──半身人王子，也就是刚铎人们给他的称号。但他觉得浑身不舒服，而这永不散去的黑暗也让他觉得心情沉重。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Already it seemed years to Pippin since he had sat there before, in some half-forgotten time when he had still been a hobbit, a light-hearted wanderer touched little by the perils he had passed through. Now he was one small soldier in a city preparing for a great assault, clad in the proud but sombre manner of the Tower of Guard.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对皮聘来说，他上次坐在这里似乎是好几年之前的事情了；那时他还是个无忧无虑，不受一路上的磨难影响的快乐哈比人。现在，他是个准备面对恐怖攻势的大城中的一名小小士兵，身上披着带有悠久历史，却十分沉重的高塔卫戍部队制服。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was the sunset-hour, but the great pall had now stretched far into the West, and only as it sank at last into the Sea did the Sun escape to send out a brief farewell gleam before the night, even as Frodo saw it at the Cross-roads touching the head of the fallen king. But to the fields of the Pelennor, under the shadow of Mindolluin, there came no gleam: they were brown and drear.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在时间该是日落了，但铺天盖地的乌云已经彻底遮蔽了天空，只有在太阳落到靠近海面的时候，才投射出短暂的光芒。这时，佛罗多正好在那十字路口看见戒灵之王的踪影。不过，在明都陆安山阴影之下的帕兰诺平原则是一片死寂，没有任何的光线。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">About the eleventh hour, released at last for a while from service, Pippin came out and went in search of food and drink to cheer his heavy heart and make his task of waiting more supportable. In the messes he met Beregond again, who had just come from an errand over the Pelennor out to the Guard-towers upon the Causeway. Together they strolled out to the walls; for Pippin felt imprisoned indoors, and stifled even in the lofty citadel. Now they sat side by side again in the embrasure looking eastward, where they had eaten and talked the day before.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大约在日出后第十一个小时，皮聘终于可以暂时休息一下。于是，他离开高塔，想要找些吃的和喝的，一方面激励自己低落的士气，一方面也让自己比较有力气工作。在公共食堂中他又再度遇见了贝瑞贡，他才刚出完帕兰诺平原上的任务。两人一起走出内城，因为皮聘待在室内就觉得呼吸不顺畅，在守卫森严的要塞中更是如此。两人又再度并肩坐在同样的空地上，看着东方。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes," said Pippin, "very: tired out with idleness and waiting. I have kicked my heels at the door of my master's chamber for many slow hours, while he has debated with Gandalf and the Prince and other great persons. And I'm not used, Master Beregond, to waiting hungry on others while they eat. It is a sore trial for a hobbit, that. No doubt you will think I should feel the honour more deeply. But what is the good of such honour? Indeed what is the good even of food and drink under this creeping shadow? What does it mean? The very air seems thick and brown! Do you often have such glooms when the wind is in the East?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，”皮聘说：“很累了，我已经厌倦了无所事事的等待。我在我主的门口不停地踱步，熬过了许多个小时，在这段时间中，他一直和甘道夫、印拉希尔王和其他重要的人物争辩。贝瑞贡先生，而且，到现在我还是不习惯饿着肚子服侍别人，看着他们吃东西，这对于哈比人来说真是个严酷的考验。我想你一定会认为我应该要觉得光荣，但是，光荣又如何？事实上，在这恐怖的阴影之下，就算是吃吃喝喝又怎么样？这到底是怎么一回事？整个世界似乎都陷入一片黑暗之中！难道每当吹起东风，你们就会看见这样的景象吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In some other time and place Pippin might have been pleased with his new array, but he knew now that he was taking part in no play; he was in deadly earnest the servant of a grim master in the greatest peril. The hauberk was burdensome, and the helm weighed upon his head. His cloak he had cast aside upon the seat. He turned his tired gaze away from the darkling fields below and yawned, and then he sighed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果在其他的时空之下，皮聘或许会对自己身穿的新衣感到高兴，但是，他现在知道这并非儿戏。他是在面临无比危机的君主麾下，一名誓死效忠的仆人。锁子甲十分沉重，头盔也让他觉得无法行动自如。他将斗篷披在椅子上，疲倦地将眼光从黑暗的平原上移开，打了个哈欠，接着又叹了一口气。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Nay," said Beregond, "this is no weather of the world. This is some device of his malice; some broil of fume from the Mountain of Fire that he sends to darken hearts and counsel. And so it doth indeed. I wish the Lord Faramir would return. He would not be dismayed. But now, who knows if he will ever come back across the River out of the Darkness?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，”贝瑞贡说：“这并非是属于人间的天候，这是他的阴谋，这是他从火山之中激发出的毒烟，想要摧折我们的士气，这的确产生了影响。我希望法拉墨王子可以赶快回来，他绝不会低头丧志的。可是，现在谁知道他能不能穿过黑暗，渡河回来？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes," said Pippin, "Gandalf, too, is anxious. He was disappointed, I think, not to find Faramir here. And where has he got to himself? He left the Lord's council before the noon-meal, and in no good mood either, I thought. Perhaps he has some foreboding of bad news."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你说的没错，”皮聘回答：“甘道夫也很担心，我觉得，他没找到法拉墨觉得很失望，他现在又跑到哪里去了？在午餐之前他就离开了摄政王的会议室，我想他的心情也很糟糕，或许他已经知道了一些不好的消息。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Suddenly as they talked they were stricken dumb, frozen as it were to listening stones. Pippin cowered down with his hands pressed to his ears; but Beregond, who had been looking out from the battlement as he spoke of Faramir, remained there, stiffened, staring out with starting eyes. Pippin knew the shuddering cry that he had heard: it was the same that he had heard long ago in the Marish of the Shire, but now it was grown in power and hatred, piercing the heart with a poisonous despair.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然间，两人都停了下来，连声音都彷佛被冻结一般。皮聘捂着耳朵蹲了下来，谈话时正望向城外寻找法拉墨身影的贝瑞贡则是无法动弹，用呆滞的眼光看着城外。皮聘从那刺耳的尖叫声中就知道它的来源；这是他许久以前在夏尔的森林中所听到的同一个声音。只是，它的力量变得更强，仇恨变得更深，让剧毒的绝望毫不留情地刺穿透人心。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Reluctantly Pippin climbed on to the seat and looked out over the wall. The Pelennor lay dim beneath him, fading away to the scarce guessed line of the Great River. But now wheeling swiftly across it, like shadows of untimely night, he saw in the middle airs below him five birdlike forms, horrible as carrion-fowl yet greater than eagles, cruel as death. Now they swooped near, venturing almost within bowshot of the walls, now they circled away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="皮聘不情愿地离开座位，望着城外。帕兰诺平原笼罩在黑暗中，他只能依稀辨别安都因大河模糊的身影。此刻，当他凝神细看的时候，他可以发现有五个身影在他底下的空中飞翔着；那身影如同夜晚一样的黑暗，像是兀鹰一样的冷酷，却又比巨鹰庞大，浑身散发着死亡的气息。它们越飞越近，几乎要进入城中弓箭的射程内，但随即又盘旋离开。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At last Beregond spoke with an effort. "They have come!" he said. "Take courage and look! There are fell things below."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后，贝瑞贡勉强挤出几句话：“他们来了！”他说：“鼓起勇气往下看！那些堕落的生物出现了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Black Riders!" muttered Pippin. "Black Riders of the air! But see, Beregond!" he cried. "They are looking for something, surely? See how they wheel and swoop, always down to that point over there! And can you see something moving on the ground? Dark little things. Yes, men on horses: four or five. Ah! I cannot stand it! Gandalf! Gandalf save us!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“黑骑士！”皮聘呢喃着：“会飞的黑骑士！贝瑞贡，你看！”他大喊着：“它们一定是在找什么东西！你看看它们一直在盘旋俯冲，全都瞄准着那一点！你可以看见那边有什么东西正在移动吗？黑色的小东西。没错，是骑着马的人，四个还是五个！啊！我受不了了！甘道夫！甘道夫快来救我们…”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Another long screech rose and fell, and he threw himself back again from the wall, panting like a hunted animal. Faint and seemingly remote through that shuddering cry he heard winding up from below the sound of a trumpet ending on a long high note.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="另外一声凄厉的尖叫响起，他靠着墙壁，像是被猎杀的动物一般不停地喘息。与这尖叫声相形之下显得十分遥远、微弱的是断续的号角声，这号角最后的声音最后还猛然往上扬。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">With that Beregond sprang away and ran off into the gloom. Ashamed of his terror, while Beregond of the Guard thought first of the captain whom he loved, Pippin got up and peered out. At that moment he caught a flash of white and silver coming from the North, like a small star down on the dusky fields. It moved with the speed of an arrow and grew as it came, converging swiftly with the flight of the four men towards the Gate. It seemed to Pippin that a pale light was spread about it and the heavy shadows gave way before it; and then as it drew near he thought that he heard, like an echo in the walls, a great voice calling.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="话声一落，贝瑞贡立刻奔入眼前的黑暗中。贝瑞贡这种不顾己身安危，先想到长官的行为，让皮聘觉得十分羞愧。他立刻站起身，开始打量着四周。就在那一刻，他发现了一道白光从北方冲来，像是平原上的一道流星；它以如同飞箭一般的速度前进，和四人会合，一起奔向正门。在皮聘眼中，那苍白的光芒似乎正在不停地扩散，将阴影驱散开来。当那身影越来越靠近的时候，他觉得似乎听见了一声大吼。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Faramir! The Lord Faramir! It is his call!" cried Beregond. "Brave heart! But how can he win to the Gate, if these foul hell-hawks have other weapons than fear? But look! They hold on. They will make the Gate. No! the horses are running mad. Look! the men are thrown; they are running on foot. No, one is still up, but he rides back to the others. That will be the Captain: he can master both beasts and men. Ah! there one of the foul things is stooping on him. Help! help! Will no one go out to him? Faramir!"</div>

Men now hurried out to them from the City; and soon they all passed from sight under the outer walls, and he knew that they were entering the Gate. Guessing that they would come at once to the Tower and the Steward, he hurried to the entrance of the citadel. There he was joined by many others who had watched the race and the rescue from the high walls.</div>

One wheeled towards him; but it seemed to Pippin that he raised his hand, and from it a shaft of white light stabbed upwards.

<div class="line_en">Pippin pressed forward as they passed under the lamp beneath the gate-arch, and when he saw the pale face of Faramir he caught his breath. It was the face of one who has been assailed by a great fear or anguish, but has mastered it and now is quiet. Proud and grave he stood for a moment as he spoke to the guard, and Pippin gazing at him saw how closely he resembled his brother Boromir -- whom Pippin had liked from the first, admiring the great man's lordly but kindly manner. Yet suddenly for Faramir his heart was strangely moved with a feeling that he had not known before. Here was one with an air of high nobility such as Aragorn at times revealed, less high perhaps, yet also less incalculable and remote: one of the Kings of Men born into a later time, but touched with the wisdom and sadness of the Elder Race. He knew now why Beregond spoke his name with love. He was a captain that men would follow, that he would follow, even under the shadow of the black wings.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="皮聘紧跟在后，看着他们通过要塞的正门，当他好不容易瞄到法拉墨苍白的面孔时，他猛吸了一口气。从那张面孔上，他可以看出承受无比恐惧或痛苦的痕迹，但现在这一切都已经在法拉墨的掌握之中。当法拉墨和守卫说话时，他挺起胸，让旁人可以明显感觉到他的尊贵之气。皮聘仔细地打量着他，这才明白他和哥哥的长相有多么接近；当初皮聘第一眼见到波罗莫时，就因为他外貌威严、行事却又谨守礼仪而对他产生好感。但是，一见到法拉墨，皮聘却感觉到一股之前所没有的情绪波动──眼前是一名拥有尊贵血统和气质的人类；法拉墨给人的感觉就像是亚拉冈露出真面目时一样，或许相较起来没有那么尊贵，但也比较平易近人。这是拥有上古人皇血统的现世继承者，同时也被那古老种族的智慧和哀伤所感染。他现在才明白，贝瑞贡提到他时，为什么会对他那么尊敬。他是个人们乐于服从和跟随的将军，即使在那些黑翼的阴影笼罩之下，皮聘也愿意跟他出生入死。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was not long before a clamour was heard in the streets leading up from the outer circles, and there was much cheering and crying of the names of Faramir and Mithrandir. Presently Pippin saw torches, and followed by a press of people two horsemen riding slowly: one was in white but shining no longer, pale in the twilight as if his fire was spent or veiled; the other was dark and his head was bowed. They dismounted, and as grooms took Shadowfax and the other horse, they walked forward to the sentinel at the gate: Gandalf steadily, his grey cloak flung back, and a fire still smouldering in his eyes; the other, clad all in green, slowly, swaying a little as a weary or a wounded man.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不久之后，在通往外城的街道中就发出了极为震耳的喧闹声，人们欢呼、大喊着法拉墨和米斯兰达的名号。皮聘看见排列成行的火炬，在欢欣鼓舞的群众簇拥下缓步前进的两名骑士：白衣骑士不再发出刺眼的光芒，似乎所有的火焰都在刚刚燃烧殆尽了；另外一名骑士周身笼罩在黑暗中，头无力地低垂着。他们一起下马，随从接过影疾和另一匹马的缰绳，两人一起走向门口的卫兵：甘道夫脚步沉稳，灰色的斗篷随风翻飞，眼中依旧有着熊熊火焰残留的余烬；另一个人一身绿衣，步履有些不稳，似乎是受了伤或是因为刚刚的追逐而精疲力尽。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But with that Gandalf stepped to his side and spoke. "He came with me from the land of the Halflings," he said. "He came with me. But let us not tarry here. There is much to say and to do, and you are weary. He shall come with us. Indeed he must, for if he does not forget his new duties more easily than I do, he must attend on his lord again within this hour. Come, Pippin, follow us!"</div>

<div class="line_en">When Faramir had taken white bread and drunk a draught of wine, he sat upon a low chair at his father's left hand. Removed a little upon the other side sat Gandalf in a chair of carven wood; and he seemed at first to be asleep. For at the beginning Faramir spoke only of the errand upon which he had been sent out ten days before, and he brought tidings of Ithilien and of movements of the Enemy and his allies; and he told of the fight on the road when the men of Harad and their great beast were overthrown: a captain reporting to his master such matters as had often been heard before, small things of border-war that now seemed useless and petty, shorn of their renown.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在法拉墨吃了几片面包、喝了一大杯酒之后，他在父亲的左手边坐了下来，甘道夫坐在另外一边的木椅上。一开始，法拉墨只有提到十天前他所执行的秘密任务，他描述了伊西立安目前的状况，以及魔王和盟友们的调兵遣将。接着，他提到了在路上埋伏哈拉德林人，将他们和巨兽一起歼灭的过程。这是将军向主上进行例行报告的口吻，即使战果看来十分的辉煌，但和目前的危机相比，也沦落为稀松平常的边境冲突。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As his story was unfolded of his meeting with Frodo and his servant and of the events at Henneth Annûn, Pippin became aware that Gandalf's hands were trembling as they clutched the carven wood. White they seemed now and very old, and as he looked at them, suddenly with a thrill of fear Pippin knew that Gandalf, Gandalf himself, was troubled, even afraid. The air of the room was close and still. At last when Faramir spoke of his parting with the travellers, and of their resolve to go to Cirith Ungol, his voice fell, and he shook his head and sighed. Then Gandalf sprang up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="随着他的故事逐渐揭晓，来到了和佛罗多及仆人在汉那斯安南相遇的时刻时，皮聘发现甘道夫的手紧握着椅把，同时还在微微颤抖，那双手看起来极为苍白，变得比以前更苍老。当他打量着对方时，这才害怕地发现，无所不知的甘道夫竟然在担心、甚至是害怕；房间中的空气变得十分凝滞、沉重。最后，法拉墨陈述了和对方分别的过程，以及他们意图前往西力斯昂哥的计划；他的声音越变越低，最后他不禁抱住头，无奈地叹气。甘道夫立刻站了起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

Denethor looked at their faces and nodded his head, as though in sign that he had read much there before it was spoken. Slowly, while the others sat silent and still, Faramir told his tale, with his eyes for the most part on Gandalf, though now and again his glance strayed to Pippin, as if to refresh his memory of others that he had seen.</div>

At swiftest they could not come there before today, and maybe they have not come there yet. Indeed I see what you fear. But the darkness is not due to their venture.

"Just now, Pippin, my heart almost failed me, hearing that name. And yet in truth I believe that the news that Faramir brings has some hope in it. For it seems clear that our Enemy has opened his war at last and made the first move while Frodo was still free.

For the enemy was flinging into the City all the heads of those who had fallen fighting at Osgiliath, or on the Rammas, or in the fields. They were grim to look on; for though some were crushed and shapeless, and some had been cruelly hewn, yet many had features that could be told, and it seemed that they had died in pain; and all were branded with the foul token of the Lidless Eye.

<div class="line_en">In vain men shook their fists at the pitiless foes that swarmed before the Gate. Curses they heeded not, nor understood the tongues of western men, crying with harsh voices like beasts and carrion-birds. But soon there were few left in Minas Tirith who had the heart to stand up and defy the hosts of Mordor. For yet another weapon, swifter than hunger, the Lord of the Dark Tower had: dread and despair.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="人们徒劳无功地咒骂着那些聚集在正门前的敌人，对方毫不畏惧诅咒，也听不懂西方人类的语言，彼此之间只用类似野兽和食腐鸟类的嘶哑语言交谈。很快的，米那斯提力斯内的守军士气陷入了新的低潮，没有多少人还敢挺身抵抗魔多的部队，因为邪黑塔的帝王又带来了另一个比饥饿更快速、更强大的武器：恐惧和绝望。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Nazgûl came again, and as their Dark Lord now grew and put forth his strength, so their voices, which uttered only his will and his malice, were filled with evil and horror. Ever they circled above the City, like vultures that expect their fill of doomed men's flesh. Out of sight and shot they flew, and yet were ever present, and their deadly voices rent the air. More unbearable they became, not less, at each new cry. At length even the stout-hearted would fling themselves to the ground as the hidden menace passed over them, or they would stand, letting their weapons fall from nerveless hands while into their minds a blackness came, and they thought no more of war; but only of hiding and of crawling, and of death.</div>

<div class="line_en">Far behind the battle the River had been swiftly bridged, and all day more force and gear of war had poured across. Now at last in the middle night the assault was loosed. The vanguard passed through the trenches of fire by many devious paths that had been left between them. On they came, reckless of their loss as they approached, still bunched and herded, within the range of bowmen on the wall. But indeed there were too few now left there to do them great damage, though the light of the fires showed up many a mark for archers of such skill as Gondor once had boasted. Then perceiving that the valour of the City was already beaten down, the hidden Captain put forth his strength. Slowly the great siege-towers built in Osgiliath rolled forward through the dark.</div>

Fen Hollen it was called, for it was kept ever shut save at times of funeral, and only the Lord of the City might use that way, or those who bore the token of the tombs and tended the houses of the dead.

<div class="line_cn" title="“不！”皮聘说：“时候还没到，即使是现在，我想我们还是有机会阻止他的死亡。可是，贝瑞贡，城主在他的王城陷落之前就崩溃了，他已经发疯了，会做出很危险的事情来。”他很快地转述了迪耐瑟的诡异话语和动作。“我必须立刻找到甘道夫才行！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He ran on, down, down towards the outer city. Men flying back from the burning passed him, and some seeing his livery turned and shouted, but he paid no heed. At last he was through the Second Gate, beyond which great fires leaped up between the walls. Yet it seemed strangely silent. No noise or shouts of battle or din of arms could be heard. Then suddenly there was a dreadful cry and a great shock, and a deep echoing boom. Forcing himself on against a gust of fear and horror that shook him almost to his knees, Pippin turned a corner opening on the wide place behind the City Gate. He stopped dead. He had found Gandalf; but he shrank back, cowering into a shadow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他死命的跑着，一直朝向外城而去。人们狂奔逃离大火现场，有些注意到他穿着制服的人转过身大吼大叫，但他全不理会。最后，他终于穿过了第二门，门外的城墙几乎全都陷入烈焰之中，但是，这里却处在一种十分诡异的沉寂中，没有人们的呼喊声、没有金铁交鸣的声音，接着，突然间传来一声刺耳的吼叫声，以及一声巨大的爆响。在足以让人两腿发软的恐惧中，皮聘强逼着自己走到正门后的空地上。他停了下来，找到了甘道夫，但是，他却不由自主地倒退回来，躲进阴影中。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The drums rolled louder. Fires leaped up. Great engines crawled across the field; and in the midst was a huge ram, great as a forest-tree a hundred feet in length, swinging on mighty chains. Long had it been forging in the dark smithies of Mordor, and its hideous head, founded of black steel, was shaped in the likeness of a ravening wolf; on it spells of ruin lay. Grond they named it, in memory of the Hammer of the Underworld of old. Great beasts drew it, orcs surrounded it, and behind walked mountain-trolls to wield it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="鼓声越来越大、火势越来越猛，巨大的攻城塔、投石器不停的靠近，在这阵形之中，有一座庞大惊人的破城锤，它的长度和百年的神木一样高，藉着粗大的铁练晃动。魔多的铁匠们早已为了铸造这恐怖的武器而努力多时，它的尖端铸成咆哮狼头的形状，上面被施以破坏的法术，为了纪念远古的地狱之锤，他们将这破城锤命名为葛龙德。巨兽拖着它，四周环绕着许多的半兽人，来自山区的食人妖则是负责整个装置的使用。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ever since the middle night the great assault had gone on. The drums rolled. To the north and to the south company upon company of the enemy pressed to the walls. There came great beasts, like moving houses in the red and fitful light, the mûmakil of the Harad dragging through the lanes amid the fires huge towers and engines. Yet their Captain cared not greatly what they did or how many might be slain: their purpose was only to test the strength of the defence and to keep the men of Gondor busy in many places. It was against the Gate that he would throw his heaviest weight. Very strong it might be, wrought of steel and iron, and guarded with towers and bastions of indomitable stone, yet it was the key, the weakest point in all that high and impenetrable wall.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="自从午夜开始，敌方的攻势就从未停歇过。战鼓雷鸣，成千上万的敌人从北方和南方蜂拥而来，庞大无匹的巨兽也出现在战阵中，在这血红的光芒下，哈拉德林人拖拉着这些猛，它们巨大如同房屋般的身躯，扛着巨大的攻城塔和武器朝向正门靠近。但是，他们的统帅一点也不在乎他们的表现，或是可能遭受的损伤；这些部队的用处只是在测试敌人的防御强度，让刚铎的守军疲于奔命，他把最精锐的部队都投入正门前。正门由钢铁所铸成，在高塔和强大的火力守卫之下的确难以攻破。但是，相比于周围金刚不坏的城墙，这是整体防御中最弱的一点。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But about the Gate resistance still was stout, and there the knights of Dol Amroth and the hardiest of the garrison stood at bay. Shot and dart fell thick; siege-towers crashed or blazed suddenly like torches. All before the walls on either side of the Gate the ground was choked with wreck and with bodies of the slain; yet still driven as by a madness more and more came up.</div>

<div class="line_en">Grond crawled on. The drums rolled wildly. Over the hills of slain a hideous shape appeared: a horseman, tall, hooded, cloaked in black. Slowly, trampling the fallen, he rode forth, heeding no longer any dart. He halted and held up a long pale sword. And as he did so a great fear fell on all, defender and foe alike; and the hands of men drooped to their sides, and no bow sang. For a moment all was still.</div>
