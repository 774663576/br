<div class="line_en">Christians downplay the wrathful deity of the Old Testament in favor of a newer conception of God, exemplified in the New Testament (the Christian Bible) by his son Jesus, the Prince of Peace. Certainly loving one's enemies and turning the other cheek constitute an advance over utterly destroying all that breatheth. Jesus, to be sure, was not above using violent imagery to secure the loyalty of his flock. In Matthew 10:34-37 he says:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="基督徒尽量地淡化了《圣经·旧约》中愤怒的上帝，更多地尊奉一个新观念的神，就是《圣经·新约》中上帝的儿子耶稣，一位“和平之君”。爱你的敌人，当人打你左脸时送上右脸，当然比剿杀一切生灵更具优势。为确保追随者的忠诚，耶稣也还是不能完全不使用暴力想象。在《马太福音》第10章第34—37节，他说：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Of course, there's no direct evidence for anything that Jesus said or did. The words attributed to Jesus were written decades after his death, and the Christian Bible, like the Hebrew one, is riddled with contradictions, uncorroborated histories, and obvious fabrications. But just as the Hebrew Bible offers a glimpse into the values of the middle of the 1st millennium BCE, the Christian Bible tells us much about the first two centuries CE. Indeed, in that era the story of Jesus was by no means unique. A number of pagan myths told of a savior who was sired by a god, born of a virgin at the winter solstice, surrounded by twelve zodiacal disciples, sacrificed as a scapegoat at the spring equinox, sent into the underworld, resurrected amid much rejoicing, and symbolically eaten by his followers to gain salvation and immortality.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当然了，耶稣的所有言说和活动，我们其实都没有任何直接的证据。这些所谓耶稣的言辞，是在他死了几十年后才录写下来的。基督教《圣经》和希伯来《圣经》一样，充满了自相矛盾、无法证实的史实和明显的捏造。但也正如希伯来《圣经》让我们看到了公元前1000年中期的社会价值，基督教《圣经》则给我们讲述了公元后两个世纪的社会状态。事实上，在那个时代，耶稣的故事绝非特例。很多异教神话都讲到神派来一位救世主，在冬至那天出生，母亲是处女，出生时有十二位相应十二星宫的门徒环绕身旁，他在春分日像替罪羔羊一般被牺牲，陷身地狱，在欢乐中复活，象征性地被门徒分食，得到救赎和永生。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The preeminent symbol of the empire was the Colosseum, visited today by millions of tourists and emblazoned on pizza boxes all over the world. In this stadium, Super Bowl-sized audiences consumed spectacles of mass cruelty. Naked women were tied to stakes and raped or torn apart by animals. Armies of captives massacred each other in mock battles. Slaves carried out literal enactments of mythological tales of mutilation and death -- for example, a man playing Prometheus would be chained to a rock, and a trained eagle would pull out his liver. Gladiators fought each other to the death; our thumbs-up and thumbs-down gestures may have come from the signals flashed by the crowd to a victorious gladiator telling him whether to administer the coup de grâce to his opponent. About half a million people died these agonizing deaths to provide Roman citizens with their bread and circuses. The grandeur that was Rome casts our violent entertainment in a different light (to say nothing of our "extreme sports" and "sudden-death overtime").</div>

<div class="line_en">The most famous means of Roman death, of course, was crucifixion, the source of the word excruciating. Anyone who has ever looked up at the front of a church must have given at least a moment's thought to the unspeakable agony of being nailed to a cross. Those with a strong stomach can supplement their imagination by reading a forensic investigation of the death of Jesus Christ, based on archaeological and historical sources, which was published in 1986 in the Journal of the American Medical Association.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="罗马最著名的死刑方式当然要算是钉十字架（crucifixion），这个字眼儿的词源是“极度的痛苦或折磨”（excruciating）。任何人，只要曾经抬头仰望教堂的前方，一定会在某一瞬间有过这样的念头，被钉在十字架上必定有无法形容的痛苦。那些神经坚强的人可以通过阅读耶稣基督的尸检报告丰富他们的想象。这份报告的依据是考古学和史学资料，文章发表在1986年的《美国医学会杂志》上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A Roman execution began with a scourging of the naked prisoner. Using a short whip made of braided leather embedded with sharpened stones, Roman soldiers would flog the man's back, buttocks, and legs. According to the JAMA authors, "The lacerations would tear into the underlying skeletal muscles and produce quivering ribbons of bleeding flesh." The prisoner's arms would then be tied around a hundred-pound crossbar, and he would be forced to carry it to a site where a post was embedded in the ground. The man would be thrown onto his shredded back and nailed through the wrists to the crossbar. (Contrary to the familiar depictions, the flesh of the palms cannot support the weight of a man.) The victim was hoisted onto the post and his feet were nailed to it, usually without a supporting block. The man's rib cage was distended by the weight of his body pulling on his arms, making it difficult to exhale unless he pulled his arms or pushed his legs against the nails. Death from asphyxiation and loss of blood would come after an ordeal ranging from three or four hours to three or four days. The executioners could prolong the torture by resting the man's weight on a seat, or hasten death by breaking his legs with a club.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="罗马人行刑以鞭笞赤身裸体的囚犯开始。短鞭子用几股皮绳编结而成，鞭绳上系着尖利的石块，罗马士兵用鞭子抽打犯人的后背、臀部和双腿。据《美国医学会杂志》文章作者的描述，“创口一直撕裂到下层骨骼肌，皮肉被成条地拉出来，鲜血淋漓地颤动着”。囚犯的双臂被捆在一具100磅重的十字架上，他必须将它扛到行刑地，然后矗立在地上。他那皮开肉绽的后背会被按在十字架上，再将他的手腕钉在木头上。（与大家熟悉的画像不同，手掌上的皮肉是经不住一个男子的体重的。）当受害人被悬挂起来后，再将他的双脚钉住，通常在脚下是不使用撑板的。因为受刑人的体重完全悬在双臂上，胸腔受压，无法呼吸，他只得收紧双臂，或者双腿撑在钉进脚背的钉子上。窒息和失血直至最后死亡，整个过程可能要三四个小时，也可能要三四天。行刑者可以将受刑人的身体撑在一个座板上，以此延长酷刑的时间，也可以用木棒打断犯人的双腿，加速其死亡。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Though I like to think that nothing human is foreign to me, I find it impossible to put myself in the minds of the ancients who devised this orgy of sadism. Even if I had custody of Hitler and could mete out the desert of my choice, it would not occur to me to inflict a torture like that on him. I could not avoid wincing in sympathy, would not want to become the kind of person who could indulge in such cruelty, and could see no point in adding to the world's reservoir of suffering without a commensurate benefit. (Even the practical goal of deterring future despots, I would reason, is better served by maximizing the expectation that they will be brought to justice than by maximizing the gruesomeness of the penalty.) Yet in the foreign country we call the past, crucifixion was a common punishment. It was invented by the Persians, carried back to Europe by Alexander the Great, and widely used in Mediterranean empires. Jesus, who was convicted of minor rabble-rousing, was crucified along with two common thieves. The outrage that the story was meant to arouse was not that petty crimes were punishable by crucifixion but that Jesus was treated like a petty criminal.</div>

<div class="line_en">The crucifixion of Jesus, of course, was never treated lightly. The cross became the symbol of a movement that spread through the ancient world, was adopted by the Roman Empire, and two millennia later remains the world's most recognizable symbol. The dreadful death it calls to mind must have made it an especially potent meme. But let's step outside our familiarity with Christianity and ponder the mindset that tried to make sense of the crucifixion. By today's sensibilities, it's more than a little macabre that a great moral movement would adopt as its symbol a graphic representation of a revolting means of torture and execution. (Imagine that the logo of a Holocaust museum was a shower nozzle, or that survivors of the Rwandan genocide formed a religion around the symbol of a machete.) More to the point, what was the lesson that the first Christians drew from the crucifixion? Today such a barbarity might galvanize people into opposing brutal regimes, or demanding that such torture never again be inflicted on a living creature. But those weren't the lessons the early Christians drew at all. No, the execution of Jesus is The Good News, a necessary step in the most wonderful episode in history. In allowing the crucifixion to take place, God did the world an incalculable favor. Though infinitely powerful, compassionate, and wise, he could think of no other way to reprieve humanity from punishment for its sins (in particular, for the sin of being descended from a couple who had disobeyed him) than to allow an innocent man (his son no less) to be impaled through the limbs and slowly suffocate in agony. By acknowledging that this sadistic murder was a gift of divine mercy, people could earn eternal life. And if they failed to see the logic in all this, their flesh would be seared by fire for all eternity.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当然，耶稣上十字架，从来都被认为是大事件。十字架成为象征，引领了一场横扫中古世界的运动，基督教最终被罗马帝国所接受。2000年之后，十字架至今仍然是世界上最易辨识的标志。在人们的脑海里留下如此深刻印象的可怕死亡，必定成为一种极有力的文化基因。但是，让我们暂且退后一步，从我们所熟识的基督教之外，思索一下是什么样的心态，才会试图赋予“基督受难”某种意义。一场宏伟的道德运动选用的标志，其图像来源竟然是一件恐怖的酷刑兼死刑器具，以今天人们的情感来看，这实在令人不寒而栗。（请设想一下，集中营纪念馆用淋浴喷头做标志，或者卢旺达种族大屠杀的幸存者围绕着一柄大砍刀的图形举行某种宗教仪式。）进一步说，第一代基督徒从基督上十字架受难中看到了什么教训？在今天，这种野蛮行为可能会激起民变，或者推翻暴政，或者要求不再对任何人使用此种酷刑。但显然，早期基督徒得到的教训并非如此。相反，耶稣受难是福音，是最美妙的历史插曲中最必要的一节。耶稣受难得以发生，是神给世人的绝大恩惠。以无边的法力、怜悯和智慧，除了让一个无辜的男子（还是神的儿子）四肢被钉穿，在痛苦中慢慢窒息而死，神想不到还有其他的办法，能让人类从他们的罪与罚中得到解脱（尤其是人类的原罪之一：他们居然是那对冒犯天规的夫妇的后裔）。只要承认这一残忍的谋杀是神仁慈的礼物，人便能得到永生。而如果人搞不通其中的逻辑，他们的肉体将永堕炼狱。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Here are just a few saints whose names, if not their causes of death, are widely known. Saint Peter, an apostle of Jesus and the first Pope, was crucified upside down. Saint Andrew, the patron saint of Scotland, met his end on an X-shaped cross, the source of the diagonal stripes on the Union Jack. Saint Lawrence was roasted alive on a gridiron, a detail unknown to most Canadians who recognize his name from the river, the gulf, and one of Montreal's two major boulevards. The other one commemorates Saint Catherine, who was broken on the wheel, a punishment in which the executioner tied the victim to a wagon wheel, smashed his or her limbs with a sledgehammer, braided the shattered but living body through the spokes, and hoisted it onto a pole for birds to peck while the victim slowly died of hemorrhage and shock. (Catherine's wheel, studded with spikes, adorns the shield of the eponymous college at Oxford.) Saint Barbara, namesake of the beautiful California city, was hung upside down by her ankles while soldiers ripped her body with iron claws, amputated her breasts, burned the wounds with hot irons, and beat her head with spiked clubs. And then there's Saint George, the patron saint of England, Palestine, the republic of Georgia, the Crusades, and the Boy Scouts. Because God kept resuscitating him, George got to be tortured to death many times. He was seated astride a sharp blade with weights on his legs, roasted on a fire, pierced through the feet, crushed by a spiked wheel, had sixty nails hammered into his head, had the fat rendered out of his back with candles, and then was sawn in half.</div>

<div class="line_en">The voyeurism in the martyrologies was employed not to evoke outrage against torture but to inspire reverence for the bravery of the martyrs. As in the story of Jesus, torture was an excellent thing. The saints welcomed their torments, because suffering in this life would be rewarded with bliss in the next one. The Christian poet Prudentius wrote of one of the martyrs, "The mother was present, gazing on all the preparations for her dear one's death and showed no signs of grief, rejoicing rather each time the pan hissing hot above the olive wood roasted and scorched her child." Saint Lawrence would become the patron saint of comedians because while he was lying on the gridiron he said to his tormenters, "This side's done, turn me over and have a bite." The torturers were straight men, bit players; when they were put in a bad light it was because they were torturing our heroes, not because they used torture in the first place.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="殉教史上窥阴癖式的描述不是为了唤起对酷刑的反抗，而是为了激发对英勇先烈们的崇敬。在耶稣的故事中，酷刑成了一件绝好的事情。圣徒们欢迎自己遭受的折磨，因为此生受难将换得来世的祝福。基督教诗人普鲁登蒂乌斯（Prudentius）这样描写一位圣徒：“母亲就在现场，凝视着各式准备，为她亲爱的人的死亡；她眼中没有一丝悲伤，有的只是欣喜，橄榄木燃起的火上，烧热的铁锅滋滋作响，她的孩子被烤成炭状。”圣劳伦斯应该被喜剧演员尊为保护神，他躺在烤架上对施刑者说：“这边已经熟了，转个身，来尝一口吧。”施刑者都是普通人，有点儿像是演员。他们受到我们唾弃，仅仅是因为他们折磨了我们的英雄，而不是因为他们使用了酷刑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">During the Spanish Inquisition, church officials concluded that the conversions of thousands of former Jews didn't take. To compel the conversos to confess their hidden apostasy, the inquisitors tied their arms behind their backs, hoisted them by their wrists, and dropped them in a series of violent jerks, rupturing their tendons and pulling their arms out of their sockets. Many others were burned alive, a fate that also befell Michael Servetus for questioning the trinity, Giordano Bruno for believing (among other things) that the earth went around the sun, and William Tyndale for translating the Bible into English. Galileo, perhaps the most famous victim of the Inquisition, got off easy: he was only shown the instruments of torture (in particular, the rack) and was given the opportunity to recant for "having held and believed that the sun is the center of the world and immovable, and that the earth is not the center and moves." Today the rack shows up in cartoons featuring elasticized limbs and bad puns (Stretching exercises; Is this a wind-up? No pain no gain). But at the time it was no laughing matter. The Scottish travel writer William Lithgow, a contemporary of Galileo's, described what it was like to be racked by the Inquisition:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在西班牙宗教审判时期，教会官员们做出结论，数千名前犹太教徒的皈依不真诚。为了迫使皈依者承认他们秘密叛教，裁判官将他们的双臂捆在背后，再将他们吊在手腕上，反复地猛烈提起再抛下，受刑人肌腱撕裂，双臂脱臼。还有许多人被活活烧死。遭受这一刑罚的还有迈克尔·塞尔维特（Michael Servetus），因为他质疑三位一体；焦尔达诺·布鲁诺（Giordano Bruno），因为他相信地球围绕太阳旋转（以及其他异端）；威廉·廷代尔（William Tyndale），因为他将《圣经》译成英文。伽利略——可能是宗教审判最著名的受害者了，他逃过了这一厄运。他只是被带到了刑具面前（具体说，就是绞床面前），然后赏给他一个忏悔的机会，要求他公开宣布放弃日心说，即否认“太阳是世界的中心，而且是不动的，地球不是中心，而且是移动的”。今天动漫中出现“绞床”一词时，意思是指训练四肢的弹性（“伸展运动”）或者一些双关语（“你想给我上发条——和我较劲吗？”“无痛苦——不付出，无收获”），但在当时，这绝对不是一件可以发笑的事情。与伽利略同时代的苏格兰旅行家和作家威廉·利思戈（William Lithgow）描述了宗教审判中使用绞床的情景：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Though many Protestants were victims of these tortures, when they got the upper hand they enthusiastically inflicted them on others, including a hundred thousand women they burned at the stake for witchcraft between the 15th and 18th centuries. As so often happens in the history of atrocity, later centuries would treat these horrors in lighthearted ways. In popular culture today witches are not the victims of torture and execution but mischievous cartoon characters or sassy enchantresses, like Broom-Hilda, Witch Hazel, Glinda, Samantha, and the Halliwell sisters in Charmed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽然很多新教徒都是这类酷刑的受害者，但是，一旦他们得势，也狂热地将酷刑加诸他人，甚至包括妇女；15世纪至18世纪期间，在驱巫的名义下，有10万多妇女被施予火刑。暴力历史上常见的一个现象是，几百年后，这些令人恐怖的事件都变作轻松的谈资。在当下的流行文化中，女巫已不再是被刑讯折磨和极刑的受害者，而是动漫影视中的俏皮角色或冒失鬼，比如女巫希尔达、金缕梅、葛琳达、萨曼莎，还有《圣女魔咒》里的哈利维姐妹。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As the levers bent forward, the main force of my knees against the two planks burst asunder the sinews of my hams, and the lids of my knees were crushed. My eyes began to startle, my mouth to foam and froth, and my teeth to chatter like the doubling of a drummer's sticks. My lips were shivering, my groans were vehement, and blood sprang from my arms, broken sinews, hands, and knees. Being loosed from these pinnacles of pain, I was hand-fast set on the floor, with this incessant imploration: "Confess! Confess!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当摇杆向前扳动，我的双膝受到两块木板拉开的张力撕扯，大腿肌腱被抻断，膝盖骨破裂。我双眼惊恐地睁大，口吐白沫，上齿磕打下齿，急如鼓槌密击。双唇颤抖不已，喉咙发出呻吟，鲜血从两臂、从被撕裂的肌腱、从手掌和膝盖处喷流而出。惨痛的折磨刚刚停止，我被放到地上，旋即传来连声叫喊：“忏悔！忏悔吧！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Once again, the point of this discussion is not to accuse Christians of endorsing torture and persecution. Of course most devout Christians today are thoroughly tolerant and humane people. Even those who thunder from televised pulpits do not call for burning heretics alive or hoisting Jews on the strappado. The question is why they don't, given that their beliefs imply that it would serve the greater good. The answer is that people in the West today compartmentalize their religious ideology. When they affirm their faith in houses of worship, they profess beliefs that have barely changed in two thousand years. But when it comes to their actions, they respect modern norms of nonviolence and toleration, a benevolent hypocrisy for which we should all be grateful.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我要再次强调，我这里讨论的目的不是要指责基督徒赞成酷刑和迫害。今天，大部分虔诚的基督徒都是宽容和人道的。即使那些在电视转播布道坛上激情咆哮的人，也不会号召活烧异教徒或者吊死犹太人。那么，既然他们的信仰意味着实施酷刑是为了更崇高的目标，他们为什么不去这样做呢？答案是，在今天的西方社会，人们的宗教意识形态与他们的实际生活是隔离的。当他们在教堂持守信仰的时候，他们宣示的是两千年来未曾改变的信念；但他们在实际行动中所遵从的则是非暴力和宽容这样的现代规范。对这种仁慈的言行不一，我们大家都应该心存感激。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Institutionalized torture in Christendom was not just an unthinking habit; it had a moral rationale. If you really believe that failing to accept Jesus as one's savior is a ticket to fiery damnation, then torturing a person until he acknowledges this truth is doing him the biggest favor of his life: better a few hours now than an eternity later. And silencing a person before he can corrupt others, or making an example of him to deter the rest, is a responsible public health measure. Saint Augustine brought the point home with a pair of analogies: a good father prevents his son from picking up a venomous snake, and a good gardener cuts off a rotten branch to save the rest of the tree. The method of choice had been specified by Jesus himself: "If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在基督教国家，制度化的酷刑不只是一种盲目的习俗，还有其道德理性。如果你真的相信那些不认耶稣是救世主的人将落入炼狱，对不信基督的人施以酷刑，令其醒悟真理，岂不是对他最大的恩惠：几个时辰的痛苦总好过永世的折磨。在一个人教唆带坏他人之前令其沉默，或者杀鸡儆猴，正是一种尽责的公益举措。圣奥古斯丁（Saint Augustine）曾用过这样两个类比：慈父不会让其子捡拾毒蛇，园丁要剪除腐枝保住树木。耶稣自己也确认过对这种手段的选择：“人若不常在我里面，就像枝子丢在外面枯干，人拾起来扔在火里烧了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
