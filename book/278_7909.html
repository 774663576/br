<div class="line_en">Once upon a time there was a wicked sprite, indeed he was the most mischievous of all sprites. One day he was in a very good humor, for he had made a mirror with the power of causing all that was good and beautiful when it was reflected therein, to look poor and mean; but that which was good-for-nothing and looked ugly was shown magnified and increased in ugliness. In this mirror the most beautiful landscapes looked like boiled spinach, and the best persons were turned into frights, or appeared to stand on their heads; their faces were so distorted that they were not to be recognised; and if anyone had a mole, you might be sure that it would be magnified and spread over both nose and mouth.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="第一个故事：关于一面镜子和它的碎片">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That's glorious fun!" said the sprite. If a good thought passed through a man's mind, then a grin was seen in the mirror, and the sprite laughed heartily at his clever discovery. All the little sprites who went to his school-for he kept a sprite school-told each other that a miracle had happened; and that now only, as they thought, it would be possible to see how the world really looked. They ran about with the mirror; and at last there was not a land or a person who was not represented distorted in the mirror. So then they thought they would fly up to the sky, and have a joke there. The higher they flew with the mirror, the more terribly it grinned: they could hardly hold it fast. Higher and higher still they flew, nearer and nearer to the stars, when suddenly the mirror shook so terribly with grinning, that it flew out of their hands and fell to the earth, where it was dashed in a hundred million and more pieces. And now it worked much more evil than before; for some of these pieces were hardly so large as a grain of sand, and they flew about in the wide world, and when they got into people's eyes, there they stayed; and then people saw everything perverted, or only had an eye for that which was evil. This happened because the very smallest bit had the same power which the whole mirror had possessed. Some persons even got a splinter in their heart, and then it made one shudder, for their heart became like a lump of ice. Some of the broken pieces were so large that they were used for windowpanes, through which one could not see one's friends. Other pieces were put in spectacles; and that was a sad affair when people put on their glasses to see well and rightly. Then the wicked sprite laughed till he almost choked, for all this tickled his fancy. The fine splinters still flew about in the air: and now we shall hear what happened next.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="魔鬼说：这真够有趣。当一个虔诚和善良的思想在一个人的心里出现的时候，它就在这镜子里表现为一个露齿的怪笑。于是魔鬼对于他这巧妙的发明就发出得意的笑声来。那些进过魔鬼学校的人——因为他开办一个学校——走到哪里就宣传到哪里，说是现在有一个什么奇迹发生了。他们说，人们第一次可以看到世界和人类的本来面目。他们拿着这面镜子到处乱跑，弄得没有一个国家或民族没有在里面被歪曲过。现在他们居然想飞到天上去，去讥笑一下安琪儿或“我们的上帝”。这镜子和他们越飞得高，它就越露出些怪笑。他们几乎拿不住它。他们越飞越高，飞近上帝和安琪儿；于是镜子和它的怪笑开始可怕地抖起来，弄得它从他们的手中落到地上，跌成几亿，几千亿以及无数的碎片。这样，镜子就做出比以前还要更不幸的事情来，因为有许多碎片比沙粒还要小。它们在世界上乱飞，只要飞到人们的眼睛里去，便贴在那儿不动。这些人看起什么东西来都不对头，或者只看到事物的坏的一面，因为每块小小的碎片仍然具有整个镜子的魔力。有的人甚至心里都藏有这样一块碎片，结果不幸得很，这颗心就变成了冰块。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In a large town, where there are so many houses, and so many people, that there is no roof left for everybody to have a little garden; and where, on this account, most persons are obliged to content themselves with flowers in pots; there lived two little children, who had a garden somewhat larger than a flower-pot. They were not brother and sister; but they cared for each other as much as if they were. Their parents lived exactly opposite. They inhabited two garrets; and where the roof of the one house joined that of the other, and the gutter ran along the extreme end of it, there was to each house a small window: one needed only to step over the gutter to get from one window to the other.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在一个大城市里，房子和居民是那么多，空间是那么少，人们连一个小花园都没有。结果大多数的人只好满足于花盆里种的几朵花了。这儿住着两个穷苦的孩子，他们有一个比花盆略为大一点的花园。他们并不是兄妹，不过彼此非常亲爱，就好像兄妹一样。他们各人的父母住在面对面的两个阁楼里。两家的屋顶差不多要碰到一起；两个屋檐下面有一个水笕；每间屋子都开着一个小窗。人们只要越过水笕就可以从这个窗子钻到那个窗子里去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The children's parents had large wooden boxes there, in which vegetables for the kitchen were planted, and little rosetrees besides: there was a rose in each box, and they grew splendidly. They now thought of placing the boxes across the gutter, so that they nearly reached from one window to the other, and looked just like two walls of flowers. The tendrils of the peas hung down over the boxes; and the rose-trees shot up long branches, twined round the windows, and then bent towards each other: it was almost like a triumphant arch of foliage and flowers. The boxes were very high, and the children knew that they must not creep over them; so they often obtained permission to get out of the windows to each other, and to sit on their little stools among the roses, where they could play delightfully. In winter there was an end of this pleasure. The windows were often frozen over; but then they heated copper farthings on the stove, and laid the hot farthing on the windowpane, and then they had a capital peep-hole, quite nicely rounded; and out of each peeped a gentle friendly eye-it was the little boy and the little girl who were looking out. His name was Kay, hers was Gerda. In summer, with one jump, they could get to each other; but in winter they were obliged first to go down the long stairs, and then up the long stairs again: and out-of-doors there was quite a snow-storm.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两家的父母各有一个大匣子，里面长着一棵小玫瑰和他们所需用的菜蔬。两个匣子里的玫瑰都长得非常好看。现在这两对父母把匣子横放在水笕上，匣子的两端几乎抵着两边的窗子，好像两道开满了花的堤岸。豌豆藤悬在匣子上，玫瑰伸出长长的枝子。它们在窗子上盘着，又互相缠绕着，几乎像一个绿叶和花朵织成的凯旋门。因为匣子放得很高，孩子们都知道他们不能随便爬到上面去，不过有时他们得到许可爬上去，两人走到一起，在玫瑰花下坐在小凳子上。他们可以在这儿玩个痛快。这种消遣到冬天就完了。窗子上常常结满了冰。可是这时他们就在炉子上热一个铜板，把它贴在窗玻璃上，溶出一个小小的、圆圆的窥孔来！每个窗子的窥孔后面有一个美丽的、温和的眼珠在偷望。这就是那个小男孩和那个小女孩。男孩的名字叫加伊；女孩叫格尔达。在夏天，他们只需一跳就可以来到一起；不过在冬天，得先走下一大段梯子，然后又爬上一大段梯子。外面在飞着雪花。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The flake of snow grew larger and larger; and at last it was like a young lady, dressed in the finest white gauze, made of a million little flakes like stars. She was so beautiful and delicate, but she was of ice, of dazzling, sparkling ice; yet she lived; her eyes gazed fixedly, like two stars; but there was neither quiet nor repose in them. She nodded towards the window, and beckoned with her hand.

And if his grandmother told them stories, he always interrupted her; besides, if he could manage it, he would get behind her, put on her spectacles, and imitate her way of speaking; he copied all her ways, and then everybody laughed at him. He was soon able to imitate the gait and manner of everyone in the street. Everything that was peculiar and displeasing in them-that Kay knew how to imitate: and at such times all the people said, "The boy is certainly very clever!"

<div class="line_en">There, in the market-place, some of the boldest of the boys used to tie their sledges to the carts as they passed by, and so they were pulled along, and got a good ride. It was so capital! Just as they were in the very height of their amusement, a large sledge passed by: it was painted quite white, and there was someone in it wrapped up in a rough white mantle of fur, with a rough white fur cap on his head. The sledge drove round the square twice, and Kay tied on his sledge as quickly as he could, and off he drove with it. On they went quicker and quicker into the next street; and the person who drove turned round to Kay, and nodded to him in a friendly manner, just as if they knew each other. Every time he was going to untie his sledge, the person nodded to him, and then Kay sat quiet; and so on they went till they came outside the gates of the town. Then the snow began to fall so thickly that the little boy could not see an arm's length before him, but still on he went: when suddenly he let go the string he held in his hand in order to get loose from the sledge, but it was of no use; still the little vehicle rushed on with the quickness of the wind. He then cried as loud as he could, but no one heard him; the snow drifted and the sledge flew on, and sometimes it gave a jerk as though they were driving over hedges and ditches. He was quite frightened, and he tried to repeat the Lord's Prayer; but all he could do, he was only able to remember the multiplication table.</div>

<div class="line_en">Kay looked at her. She was very beautiful; a more clever, or a more lovely countenance he could not fancy to himself; and she no longer appeared of ice as before, when she sat outside the window, and beckoned to him; in his eyes she was perfect, he did not fear her at all, and told her that he could calculate in his head and with fractions, even; that he knew the number of square miles there were in the different countries, and how many inhabitants they contained; and she smiled while he spoke. It then seemed to him as if what he knew was not enough, and he looked upwards in the large huge empty space above him, and on she flew with him; flew high over the black clouds, while the storm moaned and whistled as though it were singing some old tune. On they flew over woods and lakes, over seas, and many lands; and beneath them the chilling storm rushed fast, the wolves howled, the snow crackled; above them flew large screaming crows, but higher up appeared the moon, quite large and bright; and it was on it that Kay gazed during the long long winter's night; while by day he slept at the feet of the Snow Queen.</div>

She therefore went out in the garden, stretched out her crooked stick towards the rose-bushes, which, beautifully as they were blowing, all sank into the earth and no one could tell where they had stood.

Gerda knew every flower; and, numerous as they were, it still seemed to Gerda that one was wanting, though she did not know which. One day while she was looking at the hat of the old woman painted with flowers, the most beautiful of them all seemed to her to be a rose. The old woman had forgotten to take it from her hat when she made the others vanish in the earth. But so it is when one's thoughts are not collected. "What!" said Gerda. "Are there no roses here?" and she ran about amongst the flowerbeds, and looked, and looked, but there was not one to be found. She then sat down and wept; but her hot tears fell just where a rose-bush had sunk; and when her warm tears watered the ground, the tree shot up suddenly as fresh and blooming as when it had been swallowed up. Gerda kissed the roses, thought of her own dear roses at home, and with them of little Kay.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“从前有三个美丽的、透明的、娇滴滴的姊妹。第一位穿着红衣服，第二位穿着蓝衣服，第三位穿着白衣服。她们在明朗的月光中，手挽着手在一个静寂的湖边跳舞。她们并不是山妖。她们是人间的女儿。空气中充满了甜蜜的香气！这几位姑娘在树林里消逝了。于是香气变得更浓厚。三口棺材——里面躺着这三位美丽的姑娘——从树丛中飘到湖上来。萤火虫在它们上面飞，像些小小的飞灯一样。这些跳舞的姑娘们在睡觉呢，还是死去了。花的香气说她们死了，同时暮钟也在发出哀悼的声音！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And Gerda went to the Ranunculuses, that looked forth from among the shining green leaves.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="格尔达走到金凤花那儿去。这花在闪光的绿叶中微笑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And the Ranunculus shone brightly, and looked again at Gerda. What song could the Ranunculus sing? It was one that said nothing about Kay either.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="金凤花放射出美丽的光彩，又把格尔达望了一眼。金凤花会唱出一支什么歌呢？这歌跟加伊没有什么关系。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"My poor old grandmother!" sighed Gerda. "Yes, she is longing for me, no doubt: she is sorrowing for me, as she did for little Kay. But I will soon come home, and then I will bring Kay with me. It is of no use asking the flowers; they only know their own old rhymes, and can tell me nothing." And she tucked up her frock, to enable her to run quicker; but the Narcissus gave her a knock on the leg, just as she was going to jump over it. So she stood still, looked at the long yellow flower, and asked, "You perhaps know something?" and she bent down to the Narcissus. And what did it say?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我可怜的老祖母！”格尔达叹了一口气说。“是的，她一定在想念着我，在为我担心，正如她在为小小的加伊担心一样。不过我马上就要回家去了，带着加伊一道回家去。探问这些花儿一点用处也没有。它们只知道唱自己的歌，一点消息也不能告诉我！”于是她把她的小罩衫扎起来，为的是可以跑得快一点。可是当她在水仙花上跳过去的时候，花绊住了她的腿。她停下来瞧瞧这棵长长的花，问道：“也许你知道一点消息吧？” 于是她向这花儿弯下腰来。这花儿讲了些什么呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"In a small court the bright sun was shining in the first days of spring. The beams glided down the white walls of a neighbor's house, and close by the fresh yellow flowers were growing, shining like gold in the warm sun-rays. An old grandmother was sitting in the air; her grand-daughter, the poor and lovely servant just come for a short visit. She knows her grandmother. There was gold, pure virgin gold in that blessed kiss. There, that is my little story," said the Ranunculus.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“在一个小院落里，我们上帝的太阳在春天的第一天暖洋洋地照着。它的光线在邻人屋子的白墙上滑行着。在这近旁，第一朵黄花开出来了，在温暖的阳光里像金子一样发亮。老祖母坐在门外的椅子上，她的孙女——一个很美丽的可怜的小姑娘——正回到家里来作短时间的拜望。她吻着祖母。这个幸福的吻里藏有金子，心里的金子。嘴唇是金子，全身是金子，这个早晨的时刻也是金子。这个呀！这就是我的故事！” 金凤花说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I can see myself-I can see myself! Oh, how odorous I am! Up in the little garret there stands, half-dressed, a little Dancer. She stands now on one leg, now on both; she despises the whole world; yet she lives only in imagination. She pours water out of the teapot over a piece of stuff which she holds in her hand; it is the bodice; cleanliness is a fine thing. The white dress is hanging on the hook; it was washed in the teapot, and dried on the roof. She puts it on, ties a saffron-colored kerchief round her neck, and then the gown looks whiter. I can see myself-I can see myself!"</div>

<div class="line_en">The gate was locked, but she shook the rusted bolt till it was loosened, and the gate opened; and little Gerda ran off barefooted into the wide world. She looked round her thrice, but no one followed her. At last she could run no longer; she sat down on a large stone, and when she looked about her, she saw that the summer had passed; it was late in the autumn, but that one could not remark in the beautiful garden, where there was always sunshine, and where there were flowers the whole year round.</div>
