<div class="line_en">Jill heard something like breaking glass and held perfectly still, listening. The acoustics of the mansion were strange, the long corridors and unusual floor plan making it hard to tell where sounds were coming from.</div>

<div class="line_en">She sighed, taking a last look around the quiet, book-lined sitting room at the top of the stairs. She'd already checked the three other rooms along the gallery railing and found exactly nothing of interest: a sparse bedroom with two bunks, an office, and an unfinished den with a locked door and a fireplace inside. The only switches she'd found were light switches, though she had gotten excited over a rather sinister-looking black button on the wall of the office until she'd pushed it, and found that she'd managed to discover the drainage control for an empty fish tank in the corner.</div>

<div class="line_en">She'd found some ammo for the Remington, she supposed she should be grateful for that -- a dozen shells in a metal box underneath one of the bunks in the bedroom. But if there'd been any hidden crests, she'd missed them.</div>

<div class="line_en">Jill took out Trent's computer and checked the map, finding her position at the top of the stairs. Just past the sitting room's second door was a wide, U-shaped corridor that angled back around to the front hall balcony. The corridor also connected to two rooms, one a dead end and the other leading through several more.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔掏出特兰特的计算机仔细地观察那张地图，确认了自己的位置目前的二楼北侧。在起居室的两扇门之中，穿过那扇楼梯另一侧的门就可以去到一条回廊。走过那条“凹”字型的回廊，可以到达正门大厅的露台。另外，回廊的后面还有两个房间，而且其中的一个房间还与其他几个房间相连接…">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She put the computer away and drew her Beretta, taking a moment to clear her mind before stepping into the corridor. It wasn't easy. Between trying to figure out what had happened in the house to create monsters and her concerns for and about her team, her thoughts were distinctly messy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔收起计算机，将贝雷塔抽出枪套，打算一边前进一边整理这些信息。这间别墅里究竟发了什么事情导致丧尸横行，自己的队友们现在的情况又会是怎样呢，她的思绪由于在这两个问题之间不停地切换而显得有些混乱。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The office had been simple, a desk, a bookshelf, but there was a rack of lab coats by the door and the papers strewn across the desk had mostly been lists of numbers and letters. She knew just enough chemistry to know that she was looking at chemistry, so she didn't bother trying to read them, but since finding the papers, she had begun to think of the zombies as the result of a research accident. The mansion was too well maintained to have come from private money, and the fact that it had been kept a secret for so long suggested a cover up. She guessed that there was a couple of months worth of dust on almost everything -- which coincided with the first attacks in Raccoon. If the people in the house had been conducting some kind of an experiment and something had gone wrong…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="办公室的装饰风格很简洁，办公家具也只有书桌和书架。在桌子上散乱地堆放着一些写满了数字与文字的文件，看上去好像是某种清单。眼前的这些化学反应公式对吉尔来说无异于天书一般，所以并没有特意地去查看，但是在她看到这些文件之后，脑海中却浮现出一个想法——别墅里的丧尸应该是某次实验事故的产物吧。这间别墅是由民间出资修建被管理着的，在很长一段时间内都保持着秘密的状态，从言一事实来推断的话这里应该是在进行某种隐蔽性的工作。根据别墅中的摆设上所堆积的灰尘来看，事故应该是在几个月前发生的——而这些又与浣熊市发生的第一起离奇案件的时间大致相同。别墅里的人在进行某种实验，然后在实验中又发生了一些不好的事情…">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Right. Jill put her musings on hold and stepped out into the hall.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是，吉尔停止了胡思乱想，朝着回廊走去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But it made more sense than anything else she could come up with, although she'd keep her mind open to other possibilities. As to her concerns about the team -- Barry was acting weird and Chris and Wesker were still missing; no new developments there.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但这只是自己对别墅中所发生的事情所作的推侧，当然也曾考虑过其他的可能性。在队友方面，巴瑞的言行有些奇怪，克里斯与威斯克现在还下落不明，自己这边也没有任何进展。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Smiling at the thought she hurried down the gloomy hall, eager to see another familiar face. As she neared the corner, a fresh wave of decay washed over her and the fallen creature at her feet grabbed at her boot, clutching her ankle with surprising strength.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="想到这里，吉尔微一笑，一心想要见到那熟悉的脸庞，于是快步向前走去。在她靠近拐角时，一股腐臭的气味猛地扑面而来。——倒在地上的丧尸抓住了吉尔的皮靴，进而握住了她的脚踝。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She noticed the smell before she actually saw the zombie farther down the corridor, crumpled to the floor. The small wall sconces cast an uneven glow over the body, reflecting off of dark red trim and tinting everything in the corridor a smoky crimson. She trained her weapon on the still body and heard a door closing somewhere close by.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在回廊的前方一个丧尸的尸体躺在地上，实际上在看到之前，就已经先闻到了那股恶臭。嫱上灯台中的蜡烛发出摇曳的光芒照在那具尸体上，回廊中的一切都被染上了一层朦胧的红色。吉尔的枪口对准了静止的尸体，就在这时突然传来了关门的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Startled, Jill flailed her arms to keep her balance, crying out in disgust as the slobbering zombie inched its rotting face toward her boot. Its peeling, skeletal fingers scrabbled weakly at the thick leather, seeking a firmer grip and Jill instinctively brought her other boot down on the back of its head, the heavy treads sliding across the skull with a sickening wet sound. A wide piece of flaking scalp tore away, revealing glistening bone. The creature kept clawing at her, oblivious to pain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔大惊失色，双手不停地挥舞想要保持平衡，并发出尖锐的叫声。丧尸翻过身来将腐烂不堪的脸贴近吉尔的皮靴，接着更加用力地抓住她的脚踝，并且露出白骨的手将吉尔一点点地往自己的怀里拖拽。吉尔反射性地用另一只脚狠狠地踹丧尸的脑袋，带着体重的鞋后跟一下子砸在对方的头盖骨上。丧尸的头皮被踹掉了，露出了下面带光泽的头骨。但是它就好像感觉不到疼痛一般，还在继续向着吉尔爬来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jill stepped over the limp body and ran around the corner, swallowing back bile. She was convinced that the pitiful creatures roaming the halls were victims somehow, just as much as Becky and Pris had been, and releasing them to death was a kindness, but they were also a menace, not to mention morbidly un-wholesome. She had to be more cautious.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔拖着筋疲力尽的身体转过拐角，感觉依然惊魂未定。在走廊中徘徊的怪物们是牺牲品，和贝齐与普利西亚一样。因此，死对他们来说是一种解脱。虽然他们同时也是一种威胁，但那都是因为痛理方面的原因所造成的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was no one inside the well-lit room but she hesitated, suddenly reluctant to continue her search for whoever else was wandering the area. Two walls of the large chamber were lined with full suits of armor, eight to a side, and there was a small display case at the back -- not to mention a large red switch set into the middle of the gray tiled floor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽然明亮的房间里一个人都没有，可是吉尔却有点儿犹豫，甚至没有想要搜查这个房间的想法。在寛阔的室内两侧排列着欧洲中世纪时期的带有头盔的铠甲，每一侧都有八套。在房间的深处摆放着一个小小的陈列柜，另外在铺着灰色瓷砖的房间正中央有一个大大的红色按钮。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Another trap? Or a puzzle…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="新的圈套？或者另一个谜题…">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Intrigued, she walked into the room and headed for the glass fronted display, the silent, lifeless guards seeming to watch her every move. There were a couple of mysterious grated holes in the floor, one on either side of the red switch, for ventilation perhaps and she felt her heart speed up a little, suddenly sure that she had found another of the mansion's traps.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔的好奇心被勾起，于是她走进房间，向着玻璃制成的陈立柜走去。她感觉两旁沉默而又毫无生气的铠甲像是卫兵一样注视着自己的行动。地上的两个莫名其妙的窟窿，就分布在红色按钮的两侧。大概是换气口吧，吉尔在心里想道，同时感到心脏的跳动速度有些加快。这一定是别墅里的新圈套。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A quick inspection of the dusty display case decided it for her; there wasn't any way that she could see to open it, the glass front a single thick piece. And something in one shadowy niche at the bottom glinted like dull copper.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔想要调查一下落满灰尘的陈列柜，但却不知道打开的方法，隐约能够看到，在玻璃柜子的底部有一个好像铜制的勋章散发出暗淡的光芒…">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She withdrew a hexagonal copper crest, engraved with an archaic smiling sun. She smiled back at it, pleased with her solution. Apparently some of the house's tricks could be worked around, provided she ignored a few rules of fair play. All the same, she found herself hurrying back to the door, not wanting to call it a win until she was clear of the solemn chamber.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔对于自己的解决方案感到很满意，于是也对着徽章上的太阳笑了笑。很明显，对于这间别墅里的圈套，完全可以简单地图避。虽说如此，吉尔还是朝着门口跑去，因为在离开这间充满了肃穆气氛的房间之前就发表胜利的宣言，好像还有些为时过早。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She crouched down next to the case and took a firm grip on the barrel of her handgun. With a single firm tap, the glass cracked, thin lines spidering away from the impact. She used the butt of the gun to knock out a thick chunk and reached carefully inside.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她在陈列柜的旁边蹲下，握住贝雷塔的枪身。然后猛地朝柜子砸去，“喀嚓”一声，玻璃被砸碎了。然后吉尔小心地将手伸了进去，接着将那个六角形的徽章拿了出来，上面刻着一个正在微笑的太阳图案。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Stepping back into the blood-hued corridor, she stood for a moment, holding the crest as she weighed her options. She could continue to look for whoever had closed that door, or head back to the puzzle lock and place the crest. As much as she wanted to find her team, Barry had been right about needing to get out of the mansion. If any of the other S. T. A. R. S. were still alive, they'd surely also be looking for an escape.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="回到走廊后，吉尔站在那里将徽章握在手中，在心里默默地思考着自己的选择。要去确认刚才将门关闭的人到底是谁？还是回到拼图式密码锁那里将这块徽章放进去？虽然很想去寻找其他队友，但正如巴瑞所说的那样，目前首要的事情就是快点从别墅里逃出去。如果S.T。A.R。S的人还活着的话，那么他们应该也在寻找着出口…">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Her decision made, Jill hurried back the way she'd come, gripping the heavy crest tightly. She'd already uncovered two of the pieces that the S. T. A. R.

<div class="line_en">Her thoughtful gaze fell across the fetid, broken creature that she'd killed, lingering on the slowly spreading pool of dark fluids surrounding its scabby head and she realized suddenly that she desperately wanted to leave the house, to escape its tainted air and the pestilent creatures that stalked its cold and dusty halls.

<div class="line_en">Barry nodded, thinking fast. "I'm pretty sure, but this place is kind of a maze… why don't you wait in the main hall while I go get her? That way we can organize our search, do a more thorough job."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="巴瑞随即点头说道：“虽然我知道，但是这间别墅好像是个迷宫一样…在我把她带回来之前，你们能在正门大厅等着吗？这样一来，我们的搜查工作也会更有效率。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But to do that, we have to find all of these crests. Jill might've turned up another one by now, maybe both of them…"</div>

<div class="line_en">"Do you know where she is?" Chris asked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你知道吉尔的所位置吗？”克里斯问道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Chris just stared at him for a moment, and Barry could see the questions forming in his bright gaze, questions that Barry wouldn't be able to answer: Why split up at all? What about finding the missing captain? How could he be certain that the back door was an escape?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克里斯眨巴着眼睛盯着巴瑞，而巴瑞好像在对方的眼神中看到了对自己所说的话的疑问。为什么我们一定要分头行动？你不是在寻找队长吗？为什么你会确信后门就是离开别墅的出口？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He smiled, hoping it looked more convincing than it felt. "Though if we don't turn up soon, keep looking for more of those pieces. The back door is at the end of the west wing corridors, first floor."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="巴瑞希望自己的这个说法能够具有足够的说服力，继而补充道“如果我没有马上回来的话，你们就继续寻找这种徽章吧。后们就在西侧走廊的尽头，在一楼。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Okay," Chris said reluctantly. "We'll wait, but if she's not where you think she is, come back and get us. We stand a better chance of making it through this place if we stick together."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“明白了。”克里斯说道，“我们回去等你。但是如果吉尔没有在你所认为的地方出现，你也要回来。我认为在这种情况下，大家还是一起行动比较好。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Barry nodded, and before Chris could say anything more, he turned and jogged away down the dim hall.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="巴瑞连忙点头。克里斯并没有再多说些什么，只是转过身去，消失在走廊的阴影里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As soon as he heard the door back to the balcony close, he picked up speed, taking the corners at a full run. There was a dead zombie near the door that led to the stairs, and Barry leaped over it, the stench falling away as he ducked through the connecting passage. He took the back stairs three at a time as his conscience yammered mercilessly away at him, reminding him of his treachery.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当背后通往露台的门关闭之后，巴瑞马上加快了脚步。在通往楼梯的门附近有一具丧尸的尸体。跨过去之后，弥漫在走廊里的恶臭减轻了不少。接着在巴瑞三步并作两步地快速前进时，他受到了自己良心的拷问，为自己的背行为感到深深地自责。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Barry shook the thoughts away as he reached the door to the covered walk, slamming the heavy metal aside. He couldn't risk it, wouldn 't -- what if Wesker had been nearby, had overheard? The captain had Barry's family to blackmail him with, but once Chris and the others knew the truth, what was to stop Wesker from just killing them? If he helped Wesker destroy the evidence, the S. T. A. R. S. wouldn't be able to prove anything, the captain could just let them all walk away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="终于达到通往被隐蔽起来的通道的门时，巴瑞将自己内心的声音暂时屏蔽，然后用力推开厚重的钢铁大门。不能冒险，我也没有勇气去冒险——如果威斯克就在附近，这些对话被听到的话，会怎么样？我家人的生命现在全都掌握在队长的手中。一旦克里斯和其他的队友得知了真相，他们会拯救我的家人吗？如果我帮助威斯克消除了那些证据，那么S.T。A.R。S就无法取证了吧。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He'd seen the hesitation in Chris's eyes, heard the uncertainty in his voice and with his final words, Barry had felt himself wanting desperately to warn his friend of Wesker's betrayal. Leaving was the only way to keep himself from saying something he might regret, something that might get his family killed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克里斯的眼睛里带着疑惑的神色，声音里也混杂着不信任感。特别是他最后说的那句话。巴瑞实在不能向他传达威斯克背叛大家的事情，他很后悔，但是为了保护家人又不得不这样做。所以他只好从克里斯的眼前消失。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">You're a liar, Barry, using your friends the way Wesker's using you, playing on their trust. You could've told them what was really going on, let them help you put a stop to it.</div>

<div class="line_en">He can get to the lab now, call off his people, he doesn 't need us anymore! I can go back in and keep the team busy while he does whatever he has to do, the RPD will show eventually and we can forget this ever happened.</div>

<div class="line_en">Barry reached the diagram next to the back door and stopped, staring. Relief flooded through him, cool and sweet. Three of the four openings were filled, the sun, wind, and star crests in place. It was over.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="巴瑞来到后门附近的控制台，当他停下脚步之后，眼睛一下子瞪得老大。只觉得一阵安心感在四肢百骸中游走。已经有三块徽章被镶嵌在控制台上，分别是太阳，风，还有星星的徽章。太好了，结束了！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was so elated that he didn't register the muted footsteps on the stone path behind him, didn't realize that he wasn't alone anymore until Wesker's smooth voice spoke up beside him.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“请将密码锁的最后一枚徽章放进去吧，波顿先生。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yeah, right," Barry muttered darkly, and slipped the final piece into place. There was a thick metallic sound from inside the door, ka-chink and Wesker walked past him, pushing the door open to reveal a small, well-used tool shed. Barry peered inside, saw the exit at the opposite wall. There was no diagram set next to it, no more crazy puzzles to figure out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“啊，好啊。”巴瑞没好气地说道，将最后一块徽章放在指定的位置上。而后，从门的内侧传来一声沉重的金属声。喀嚓…威斯克闪过巴瑞的身边将门推开，露出了门后面的样子。那是一个狭窄的仓库。巴瑞向房间里窥视着。出口在另一侧的墙上，那里并没有什么控制台。那种必须解开的无聊的密码锁已经结束弓…">查看中文翻译</div>
