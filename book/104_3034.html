<div class="line_en">She was twice Lolita's age and three quarters of mine: a very slight, dark-haired, pale-skinned adult, weighing a hundred and five pounds, with charmingly asymmetrical eyes, an angular, rapidly sketched profile, and a most appealing ensellure to her supple back -- I think she had some Spanish or Babylonian blood. I picked her up one depraved May evening somewhere between Montreal and New York, or more narrowly, between Toylestown and Blake, at a darkishly burning bar under the sign of the Tiger moth, where she was amiably drunk: she insisted we had gone to school together, and she placed her trembling little hand on my ape paw. My senses were very slightly stirred but I decided to give her a try; I did -- and adopted her as a constant companion. She was so kind, was Rita, such a good sport, that I daresay she would have given herself to any pathetic creature or fallacy, an old broken tree or a bereaved porcupine, out of sheer chumminess and compassion.</div>

<div class="line_en">When I first met her she had but recently divorced her third husband -- and a little more recently had been abandoned by her seventh cavalier servant -- the others, the mutables, were too numerous and mobile to tabulate. Her brother was -- and no doubt still is -- a prominent, pasty-faced, suspenders-and-painted-tie-wearing politician, mayor and booster of his ball-playing, Bible-reading, grain-handling home town. For the last eight years he had been paying his great little sister several hundred dollars per month under the stringent condition that she would never never enter great little Grainball City. She told me, with wails of wonder, that for some God-damn reason every new boy friend of hers would first of all take her Grainball-ward: it was a fatal attraction; and before she knew what was what, she would find herself sucked into the lunar orbit of the town, and would be following the flood-lit drive that encircled it --"going round and round," as she phrased it, "like a God-damn mulberry moth."</div>

<div class="line_en">She had a natty little coupé; and in it we traveled to California so as to give my venerable vehicle a rest. Her natural speed was ninety. Dear Rita! We cruised together for two dim years, from summer 1950 to summer 1952, and she was the sweetest, simplest, gentlest, dumbest Rita imaginable. In comparison to her, Valechka was a Schlegel, and Charlotte a Hegel.</div>

<div class="line_en">There is no earthly reason why I should dally with her in the margin of this sinister memoir, but let me say (hi, Rita -- wherever you are, drunk or hangoverish, Rita, hi!) that she was the most soothing, the most comprehending companion that I ever had, and certainly saved me from the madhouse. I told her I was trying to trace a girl and plug that girl's bully. Rita solemnly approved of the plan -- and in the course of some investigation she undertook on her own (without really knowing a thing), around San Humbertino, got entangled with a pretty awful crook herself; I had the devil of a time retrieving her -- used and bruised but still cocky. Then one day she proposed playing Russian roulette with my sacred automatic; I said you couldn't, it was not a revolver, and we struggled for it, until at last it went off, touching off a very thin and very comical spurt of hot water from the hole it made in the wall of the cabin room; I remember her shrieks of laughter.</div>

<div class="line_en">The oddly prepubescent curve of her back, her ricey skin, her slow languorous columbine kisses kept me from mischief. It is not the artistic aptitudes that are secondary sexual characters as some shams and shamans have said; it is the other way around: sex is but the ancilla of art. One rather mysterious spree that had interesting repercussions I must notice. I had abandoned the search: the fiend was either in Tartary or burning away in my cerebellum (the flames fanned by my fancy and grief) but certainly not having Dolores Haze play champion tennis on the Pacific Coast. One afternoon, on our way back East, in a hideous hotel, the kind where they hold conventions and where labeled, fat, pink men stagger around, all first names and business and booze -- dear Rita and I awoke to find a third in our room, a blond, almost albino, young fellow with white eyelashes and large transparent ears, whom neither Rita nor I recalled having ever seen in our sad lives. Sweating in thick dirty underwear, and with old army boots on, he lay snoring on the double bed beyond my chaste Rita. One of his front teeth was gone, amber pustules grew on his forehead. Ritochka enveloped her sinuous nudity in my raincoat -- the first thing at hand; I slipped on a pair of candy-striped drawers; and we took stock of the situation. Five glasses had been used, which, in the way of clues, was an embarrassment of riches. The door was not properly closed. A sweater and a pair of shapeless tan pants lay on the floor. We shook their owner into miserable consciousness. He was completely amnesic. In an accent that Rita recognized as pure Brooklynese, he peevishly insinuated that somehow we had purloined his (worthless) identity. We rushed him into his clothes and left him at the nearest hospital, realizing on the way that somehow or other after forgotten gyrations, we were in Grainball. Half a year later Rita wrote the doctor for news. Jack Humbertson as he had been tastelessly dubbed was still isolated from his personal past. Oh Mnemosyne, sweetest and most mischievous of muses!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她脊背奇异流畅的曲线，她白润如凝脂的皮肤，她轻柔、深情的吻，使我不再恶作剧了。并非艺术癖性是第二性征，象那些骗子和巫师说的，恰恰相反，性不过是艺术的附属物。我应该声明它是一种挺神秘的有味的纵乐。我早已放弃了搜寻：那魔鬼不是在塔特利就是在我脑中被烧成了灰（那火焰是幻想和悲哀煽动起的），但他绝不会让多洛雷斯黑兹在“太平洋岸”参加一流网球赛。一天下午，我们回东部的路上，拐进一家阴森森的旅馆，在这种旅馆，人们仍因循着旧习俗，贴着标签、肥肥胖胖、面色红润的男士们大摇大摆地走来走去，四处是直呼其名的叫喊，叫卖的呦喝和饮酒作乐的喧哗。就是在这家旅馆，亲爱的丽塔和我醒来发现屋里多了个第三者，一个金发碧眼，象得了白化病的年轻人，白色的眼睫毛，又大又透明的耳朵。我和丽塔谁也想不起在我们悲哀的生活里什么时候见过他。他一身又厚又脏的内衣，大汗淋漓，脚上是一双旧式军用长靴，躺在我洁净的丽洛那边的一张双人床上，鼾声大作。掉了一颗门牙，额上满是玫瑰色的小脓疤。丽塔把婀悯的裸体裹进我的雨衣里——这是手边最近的东西；我则胡乱蹬一条条纹图案的内裤；然后我们估量了一下形势。五只杯子用过了，从迹象看，他是钱多得不知怎么花了。门没有关好。一件毛衫和一条穿走了形的棕褐色裤子扔在地板上。我们摇晃它们的主人，直到他痛苦地清醒过来。他己忘记了一切。他用一种口音，丽塔听出是纯正的布鲁克林口音恼怒地说什么我们偷了他（无用的）东西。我们催他穿上衣服，把他送到最近的一家医院；途中我们发现不知怎么，我们糊里糊涂地转来转去，现在竞又是在“谷物球城”。半年后，丽塔给一位医生写了信询问那位患者的消息。杰克亨伯森，别人都这么戏谑地称呼他，仍然没有恢复记忆力。呵，摩涅莫绪涅诸女神中最可爱、最顽皮的女神！">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I would not have mentioned this incident had it not started a chain of ideas that resulted in my publishing in the Cantrip Review an essay on "Mimir and Memory," in which I suggested among other things that seemed original and important to that splendid review's benevolent readers, a theory of perceptual time based on the circulation of the blood and conceptually depending (to fill up this nutshell) on the mind's being conscious not only of matter but also of its own self, thus creating a continuous spanning of two points (the storable future and the stored past). In result of this venture -- and in culmination of the impression made by my previous travaux -- I was called from New York, where Rita and I were living in a little flat with a view of gleaming children taking shower baths far below in a fountainous arbor of Central Park, to Cantrip College, four hundred miles away, for one year. I lodged there, in special apartments for poets and philosophers, from September 1951 to June 1952, while Rita whom I preferred not to display vegetated -- somewhat indecorously, I am afraid -- in a roadside inn where I visited her twice a week. Then she vanished -- more humanly than her predecessor had done: a month later I found her in the local jail. She was très digne, had had her appendix removed, and managed to convince me that the beautiful bluish furs she had been accused of stealing from a Mrs. Roland MacCrum had really been a spontaneous, if somewhat alcoholic, gift from Roland himself. I succeeded in getting her out without appealing to her touchy brother, and soon afterwards we drove back to Central Park West, by way of Briceland, where we had stopped for a few hours the year before.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果这件事没有引起我一系列想法，并最后导致我在《坎特普周报》上发表了题为“弥米尔与记忆”的一篇文章，我也就不会提到这件事。这篇文章的众多观点之一，是提出了一种理论：感性时间基于血液循环，同时在理性上不仅依赖于主体对客体的清醒认识，而且依赖于对自身的清醒认识，因而在两点之间（可储存的未来和已储存的过去）产生了一种不间断的延续。对这份著名周报的忠实读者来说，我的许多观点都是新奇的、重要的。这次冒险的结果——以及我以前作品使读者印象颇深——就是把我从纽约和丽塔住的那套能远眺中央公园一只喷泉下，晶光闪亮的孩子们在洗淋浴的那套小公寓里，调到四百英里外的坎特普大学任教一样。从一九五一本九月到一九五二尔六月，我就住在供诗人和哲学家专用的公寓里，而丽塔，我不愿让她显出无所事事——这恐怕有些失礼——则住在路边的一家小旅店里。后来她就不见了——比前一个失踪的人当然要人道得多：一个月以后，我就在当地的监狱里找到了她。她精神很好，阑尾割了，还努力让我相信她被指控从罗兰麦克拉姆太太那儿偷的那件美丽的蓝裘皮大衣确实是人家主动送她的礼物，只是那位太太当时可能有点醉了。我没求助于她那肝火旺盛的哥哥，自己把她保了出来，而后，就开车回西中央公园，路上经过了布赖斯地，一年前我们曾在那儿逗留了几小时。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A curious urge to relive my stay there with Lolita had got hold of me. I was entering a phase of existence where I had given up all hope of tracing her kidnaper and her. I now attempted to fall back on old settings in order to save what still could be saved in the way of souvenir, souvenir que me veux-tu? Autumn was ringing in the air. To a post card requesting twin beds Professor Hamburg got a prompt expression of regret in reply. They were full up. They had one bathless basement room with four beds which they thought I would not want. Their note paper was headed: THE ENCHANTED HUNTERS</div>

I also wondered if a hunter, enchanted or otherwise, would not need a pointer more than a pew, and with a spasm of pain I recalled a scene worthy of a great artist: petite nymphe accroupie; but that silky cocker spaniel had perhaps been a baptized one. No -- I felt I could not endure the throes of revisiting that lobby. There was a much better possibility of retrievable time elsewhere in soft, rich-colored, autumnal Briceland. Leaving Rita in a bar, I made for the town library. A twittering spinster was only too glad to help me disinter mid-August 1947 from the bound Briceland Gazette, and presently, in a secluded nook under a naked light, I was turning the enormous and fragile pages of a coffin-black volume almost as big as Lolita.</div>

<div class="line_en">Reader! Bruder! What a foolish Hamburg that Hamburg was! Since his supersensitive system was loath to face the actual scene, he thought he could at least enjoy a secret part of it -- which reminds one of the tenth or twentieth soldier in the raping queue who throws the girl's black shawl over her white face so as not to see those impossible eyes while taking his military pleasure in the sad, sacked village. What I lusted to get was the printed picture that had chanced to absorb my trespassing image while the Gazette's photographer was concentrating on Dr. Braddock and his group. Passionately I hoped to find preserved the portrait of the artist as a younger brute. An innocent camera catching me on my dark way to Lolita's bed -- what a magnet for Mnemosyne! I cannot well explain the true nature of that urge of mine. It was allied, I suppose, to that swooning curiosity which impels one to examine with a magnifying glass bleak little figures -- still life practically, and everybody about to throw up -- at an early morning execution, and the patient's expression impossible to make out in the print. Anyway, I was literally gasping for breath, and one corner of the book of doom kept stabbing me in the stomach while I scanned and skimmed… Brute Force and Possessed were coming on Sunday, the 24th, to both theatres. Mr. Purdom, independent tobacco auctioneer, said that ever since 1925 he had been an Omen Faustum smoker. Husky Hank and his petite bride were to be the guests of Mr. and Mrs. Reginald G. Gore, 58 Inchkeith Ave. The size of certain parasites is one sixth of the host. Dunkerque was fortified in the tenth century. Misses' socks, 39 c. Saddle Oxfords 3.98. Wine, wine, wine, quipped the author of Dark Age who refused to be photographed, may suit a Persian bubble bird, but I say give me rain, rain, rain on the shingle roof for roses and inspiration every time. Dimples are caused by the adherence of the skin to the deeper tissues. Greeks repulse a heavy guerilla assault -- and, ah, at last, a little figure in white, and Dr. Braddock in black, but whatever spectral shoulder was brushing against his ample form -- nothing of myself could I make out.</div>
