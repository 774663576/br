<div class="line_en">He had set sail from the Shields with ninety-three, of the hundred that had once made up the Iron Fleet, a fleet belonging not to a single lord but to the Seastone Chair itself, captained and crewed by men from all the islands. Ships smaller than the great war dromonds of the green lands, aye, but thrice the size of any common longship, with deep hulls and savage rams, fit to meet the king's own fleets in battle.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the Stepstones they ha d taken on grain and game and fresh water, after the long voyage along the bleak and barren coast of Dorne with its shoals and whirlpools. There, the Iron Victory had captured a fat merchant ship, the great cog Noble Lady, on her way to Oldtown by way of Gulltown, Dusk endale, and King's Landing, with a cargo of salt cod, whale oil, and pickled herring. The food was a welcome addition to their stores. Five other prizes taken in the Redwyne Straights and along the Dornish coast -- three cogs, a galleas, and a galley -- had brought their numbers to ninety-nine.</div>

<div class="line_en">The last ship to appear had been the Maiden's Bane, three days previous. The day before that, three ships had come out of the south together -- his captive Noble Lady, lumbering along between Ravenfeeder and Iron Kiss. But the day before and the day before there had been nothing, and only Headless Jeyne and Fear before that, then two more days of empty seas and cloudless skies after Ralf the Limper appeared with the remnants of his squadron. Lord Quellon, White Widow, Lamentation, Woe, Leviathan, Iron Lady, Reaper's Wind, and Warhammer, with six more ships behind, two of them storm-wracked and under tow.</div>

<div class="line_en">Nine-and-ninety ships had left the Stepstones in three proud fleets, with orders to join up again off the southern tip of the Isle of Cedars. Forty-five had now arrived on the far side of the world. Twenty-two of Victarion's own had straggled in, by threes and fours, sometimes alone; fourteen of Ralf the Limper's; only nine of those that had sailed with Red Ralf Stonehouse. Red Ralf himself was amongst the missing. To their number the fleet had added nine new prizes taken on the seas, so the sum was fifty-four… but the captured ships were cogs and fishing boats, merchantmen and slavers, not warships. In battle, they would be poor substitutes for the lost ships of the Iron Fleet.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Storms," Ralf the Limper had muttered when he came crawling to Victarion. "Three big storms, and foul winds between. Red winds out of Valyria that smelled of ash and brimstone, and black winds that drove us toward that blighted shore. This voyage was cursed from the first. The Crow's Eye fears you, my lord, why else send you so far away? He does not mean for us to return."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“风暴，”瘸子拉尔夫喃喃地说，他向维克塔利昂爬来。“三场大风暴，之间夹杂着逆风。从瓦雷利亚刮来的红风，带有灰烬和硫磺的气味，黑风将我们赶向毁灭的海岸。这次远行从一开始就被诅咒了。鸦眼害怕你，我的大人，打发你如此遥远为了什么呢？他并不打算让我们返回。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Victarion had thought the same when he met the first storm a day out of Old Volantis. The gods hate kinslayers, he brooded, elsewise Euron Crow's Eye would have died a dozen deaths by my hand. As the sea crashed around him and the deck rose and fell beneath his feet, he had seen Dagon's Feast and Red Tide slammed together so violently that both exploded into splinters. My brother's work, he'd thought. Those were the first two ships he'd lost from his own third of the fleet. But not the last.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一天，当维克塔利昂离开旧瓦兰提斯遇到第一场风暴时，想过同样的问题。神恨弑亲者，他考虑，否则鸦眼攸伦会在我手上死掉一千次。大海撞击着他，甲板在他脚下上升下降，他看到戴贡之盛宴号和赤潮号砰地撞在一起，如此猛烈以至于两艘船都炸成了碎片。“我哥哥的杰作，”他想。那是他自己的第三舰队损失的头两艘船。但不是最后的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So he had slapped the Limper twice across the face and said, "The first is for the ships you lost, the second for your talk of curses. Speak of that again and I will nail your tongue to the mast. If the Crow's Eye can make mutes, so can I." The throb of pain in his left hand made the words harsher than they might have been elsewise, but he meant what he said. "More ships will come. The storms are done for now. I will have my fleet."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所以他在瘸子的脸上扇了俩巴掌，说，“第一下是为了你损失的船，第二下是为了你谈及诅咒。再提到那个词，我会把你的舌头钉在桅杆上。如果鸦眼能够制造哑巴，那么我也能。”他的左手抽痛，使这个诺言比其恐吓之意更严厉，但是他说到做到。“会来更多的船。现在风暴结束了。我会得到我的舰队。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Fifty-four," he grumbled. It would have been too much to hope for the full strength of the Iron Fleet after a voyage of such length… but seventy ships, even eighty, the Drowned God might have granted him that much. Would that we had the Damphair with us, or some other priest. Victarion had made sacrifice before setting sail, and again in the Stepstones when he split the fleet in three, but perhaps he had said the wrong prayers. That, or the Drowned God has no power here. More and more, he had come to fear that they had sailed too far, into strange seas where even the gods were queer… but such doubts he confided only to his dusky woman, who had no tongue to repeat them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“五十四，”他嘟囔。一段如此长的航行之后，铁舰队完好无损，已成奢望…但七十艘船，甚至八十艘，淹神也许已经赐给他这么多。我们该带上湿发，或一些别的牧师。起航前维克塔利昂举行了献祭，当他在石阶列岛把舰队一分为三时，又举行了一次，但是也许他说错了祷词。那个，或者淹神在这里没有力量。他越来越担心，他们已航行得太远，进入了陌生的海域，甚至神灵都是古怪的…但这种疑虑，他只向他的黑皮肤女人吐露过，她没有舌头去乱讲。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A monkey on the mast above howled derision, almost as if it could taste his frustration. Filthy, noisy beast. He could send a man up after it, but the monkeys seemed to like that game and had proved themselves more agile than his crew. The howls rang in his ears, though, and made the throbbing in his hand seem worse.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="上头桅杆上一只猴子嚎叫嘲笑，就像是它能品尝到他的挫折。肮脏的，吵闹的畜生。他本可以派一个人上去追它，但猴子们似乎喜欢这个游戏，并证明了它们比他的船员更敏捷。可是，嚎叫声在他的耳边回响，使他的手似乎抽痛得更厉害了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When Grief appeared, Victarion summoned Wulfe One-Ear. "I will want words with the Vole. Send word to Ralf the Limper, Bloodless Tom, and the Black Shepherd. All hunting parties are to be recalled, the shore camps broken up by first light. Load as much fruit as can be gathered and drive the pigs aboard the ships. We can slaughter them at need. Shark is to remain here to tell any stragglers where we've gone." She would need that long to make repairs; the storms had left her little more than a hulk. That would bring them down to fifty-three, but there was no help for it. "The fleet departs upon the morrow, on the evening tide."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="悲伤号出现时，维克塔利昂传唤一只耳沃尔夫。“我想和田鼠说话。传令给瘸子拉尔夫，冷酷的汤姆，和黑色牧羊人。召回所有的狩猎队，黎明时分拔营。把采集的水果全部装上船，把猪群赶上船。困难之时我们可以宰杀它们。鲨鱼号留在这里以便告诉任何掉队者我们去了哪儿。”修补她需要太长时间；几场风暴让她比一堆废木头好不了多少。这会使他们的船数下降到五十三，但无法避免。“舰队明日乘晚潮出发。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In Volantis he had seen the galleys taking on provisions. The whole city had seemed drunk. Sailors and soldiers and tinkers had been observed dancing in the streets with nobles and fat merchants, and in every inn and winesink cups were being raised to the new triarchs. All the talk had been of the gold and gems and slaves that would flood into Volantis once the dragon queen was dead. One day of such reports was all that Victarion Greyjoy could stomach; he paid the gold price for food and water, though it shamed him, and took his ships back out to sea.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在瓦兰提斯他看到战舰在装给养。整座城市仿佛喝醉了。看到水手、士兵、铁匠和贵族、胖商人一起在街上跳舞，在大大小小的每一家酒馆，酒杯被举起为新的三元老干杯。谈论的都是，一旦龙女王死了，黄金、宝石和奴隶将涌入瓦兰提斯。有一天，面对这样的传闻，维克塔利昂·葛雷乔伊的忍耐达到了极限；他为食物和水付了‘金钱’，尽管这让他感到丢脸，带着他的船队回到了大海。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The storms would have scattered and delayed the Volantenes, even as they had his own ships. If fortune smiled, many of their warships might have sunk or run aground. But not all. No god was that good, and those green galleys that survived by now could well have sailed around Valyria. They will be sweeping north toward Meereen and Yunkai, great dromonds of war teeming with slave soldiers. If the Storm God spared them, by now they could be in the Gulf of Grief. Three hundred ships, perhaps as many as five hundred. Their allies were already off Meereen: Yunkishmen and Astapors, men from New Ghis and Qarth and Tolos and the Storm God knew where else, even Meereen's own warships, the ones that fled the city before its fall. Against all that, Victarion had four-and-fifty. Three-and-fifty, less the Shark.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“是，船长，”一只耳沃尔夫说。他不及理发师纽特的一半，但鸦眼偷走了纽特。通过提拔他当橡盾岛的领主，他哥哥将维克塔利昂最好的人据为己有。“仍然驶向弥林？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Crow's Eye had sailed halfway across the world, reaving and plundering from Qarth to Tall Trees Town, calling at unholy ports beyond where only madmen went.

<div class="line_cn" title="鸦眼航行至半个世界，从魁尔斯到高树镇大肆劫掠，停靠在只有疯子才去的更远处的邪恶港口。攸伦甚至勇敢地面对烟海，并且活着讲述它。仅凭一艘船完成这些。如果他可以蔑视众神，我也能。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Was it too much to hope that for once Euron had told it true? Perhaps. Like as not, the girl would prove to be some pock-faced slattern with teats slapping against her knees, her "dragons" no more than tattooed lizards from the swamps of Sothoryos. If she is all that Euron claims, though… They had heard talk of the beauty of Daenerys Targaryen from the lips of pirates in the Stepstones and fat merchants in Old Volantis. It might be true. And Euron had not made Victarion a gift of her; the Crow's Eye meant to take her for himself. He sends me like a serving man to fetch her. How he will howl when I claim her for myself.

<div class="line_en">Victarion did not like this sea, nor these endless cloudless skies, nor the blazing sun that beat down on their heads and baked the decks until the boards were hot enough to scorch bare feet. He did not like these storms, which seemed to come up out of nowhere. The seas around Pyke were often stormy, but there at least a man could smell them coming. These southron storms were as treacherous as women. Even the water was the wrong color -- a shimmering turquoise close to shore, and farther out a blue so deep that it was almost black. Victarion missed the grey-green waters of home, with their whitecaps and surges.</div>

<div class="line_en">The monkeys, though… the monkeys were a plague. Victarion had forbidden his men to bring any of the demonic creatures aboard ship, yet somehow half his fleet was now infested with them, even his own Iron Victory.

<div class="line_en">He did not like this Isle of Cedars either. The hunting might be good, but the forests were too green and still, full of twisted trees and queer bright flowers like none his men had ever seen before, and there were horrors lurking amongst the broken palaces and shattered statues of drowned Velos, half a league north of the point where the fleet lay at anchor. The last time Victarion had spent a night ashore, his dreams had been dark and disturbing and when he woke his mouth was full of blood. The maester said he had bitten his own tongue in his sleep, but he took it for a sign from the Drowned God, a warning that if he lingered here too long, he would choke on his own blood.</div>

<div class="line_en">On the day the Doom came to Valyria, it was said, a wall of water three hundred feet high had descended on the island, drowning hundreds of thousands of men, women, and children, leaving none to tell the tale but some fisherfolk who had been at sea and a handful of Velosi spearmen posted in a stout stone tower on the island's highest hill, who had seen the hills and valleys beneath them turn into a raging sea.

Fools. Nine-and-ninety ships we had… a cumbersome beast to shepherd across the seas to the far end of the world. If I'd kept them together, the faster ships would have been held hostage to the slowest. And where to find provisions for so many mouths? No port wants so many warships in their waters.

<div class="line_en">A fool's question. Maesters had their uses, but Victarion had nothing but contempt for this Kerwin. With his smooth pink cheeks, soft hands, and brown curls, he looked more girlish than most girls. When first he came aboard the Iron Victory, he had a smirky little smile too, but one night off the Stepstones he had smiled at the wrong man, and Burton Humble had knocked out four of his teeth. Not long after that Kerwin had come creeping to the captain to complain that four of the crew had dragged him belowdecks and used him as a woman. "Here is how you put an end to that," Victarion had told him, slamming a dagger down on the table between them. Kerwin took the blade -- too afraid to refuse it, the captain judged -- but he had never used it.</div>

<div class="line_en">Victarion remembered the fight as if it had been yesterday. His shield had been in shards, hanging useless from his arm, so when Serry's longsword came flashing down he had reached up and caught it. The stripling had been stronger than he looked; his blade bit through the lobstered steel of the captain's gauntlet and the padded glove beneath into the meat of his palm. A scratch from a little kitten, Victarion told himself afterward. He had washed the cut, poured some boiled vinegar over it, bound it up, and thought little more of it, trusting that the pain would fade and the hand heal itself in time.</div>

<div class="line_en">Instead the wound had festered, until Victarion began to wonder whether Serry's blade had been poisoned. Why else would the cut refuse to heal? The thought made him rage. No true man killed with poison. At Moat Cailin the bog devils had loosed poisoned arrows at his men, but that was to be expected from such degraded creatures. Serry had been a knight, highborn. Poison was for cravens, women, and Dornishmen.</div>

He might be using one to poison me, hoping I will let him cut my hand off." The more he thought on it, the more likely it seemed. "The Crow's Eye gave him to me, wretched creature that he is." Euron had taken Kerwin off Greenshield, where he had been in service to Lord Chester, tending his ravens and teaching his children, or perhaps the other away around. And how the mouse had squealed when one of Euron's mutes delivered him aboard the Iron Victory, dragging him along by the convenient chain about his neck. "If this is his revenge, he wrongs me. It was Euron who insisted he be taken, to keep him from making mischief with his birds." His brother had given him three cages of ravens too, so Kerwin could send back word of their voyaging, but Victarion had forbidden him to loose them. Let the Crow's Eye stew and wonder.</div>

<div class="line_en">R'hllor. A red priest, then. Victarion had seen such men in foreign cities, tending their sacred fires. Those had worn rich red robes of silk and velvet and lambswool. This one was dressed in faded, salt-stained rags that clung to his thick legs and hung about his torso in tatters… but when the captain peered at the rags more closely, it did appear as if they might once have been red. "A pink priest," Victarion announced.</div>

<div class="line_en">"A demon priest," said Wulfe One-Ear. He spat. "Might be his robes caught fire, so he jumped overboard to put them out," suggested Longwater Pyke, to general laughter. Even the monkeys were amused. They chattered overhead, and one flung down a handful of his own shit to spatter on the boards.</div>

<div class="line_en">Victarion Greyjoy mistrusted laughter. The sound of it always left him with the uneasy feeling that he was the butt of some jape he did not understand. Euron Crow's Eye had oft made mock of him when they were boys. So had Aeron, before he had become the Damphair. Their mockery oft came disguised as praise, and sometimes Victarion had not even realized he was being mocked. Not until he heard the laughter. Then came the anger, boiling up in the back of his throat until he was like to choke upon the taste. That was how he felt about the monkeys. Their antics never brought so much as a smile to the captain's face, though his crew would roar and hoot and whistle.</div>

All of you. Pyke, put up your steel. Vole, back to your ship. Humble, take the wizard to my cabin. The rest of you, about your duties." For half a heartbeat he was not certain they would obey.

Wisps of dark smoke rose from his fingers as he pointed at the maester. "That one. Cut his throat and throw him in the sea, and the winds will favor us all the way to Meereen."
