<div class="line_en">Slowly walking along, Siddhartha pondered. He realized that he was no youth any more, but had turned into a man. He realized that one thing had left him, as a snake is left by its old skin, that one thing no longer existed in him, which had accompanied him throughout his youth and used to be a part of him: the wish to have teachers and to listen to teachings. He had also left the last teacher who had appeared on his path, even him, the highest and wisest teacher, the most holy one, Buddha, he had left him, had to part with him, was not able to accept his teachings.</div>

<div class="line_en">When Siddhartha left the grove, where the Buddha, the perfected one, stayed behind, where Govinda stayed behind, then he felt that in this grove his past life also stayed behind and parted from him. He pondered about this sensation, which filled him completely, as he was slowly walking along. He pondered deeply, like diving into a deep water he let himself sink down to the ground of the sensation, down to the place where the causes lie, because to identify the causes, so it seemed to him, is the very essence of thinking, and by this alone sensations turn into realizations and are not lost, but become entities and start to emit like rays of light what is inside of them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当席特哈尔塔离开活佛以及戈文达所在的林苑时，他觉得自己把以前的生活也留在身后，与之彻底分手了。他慢慢地走着，边走边累索这种充满了他身心的感受。他沉思着，就好像潜过一片深水，让自己沉到这种感觉的底部，一直沉到根由所在之处，因为他觉得思考就能认识到根由，感觉只有这样才能上升为认识，不至于迷途，而是掌握本质，并且开始放射出内在的光彩。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Slower, he walked along in his thoughts and asked himself: "But what is this, what you have sought to learn from teachings and from teachers, and what they, who have taught you much, were still unable to teach you?" And he found: "It was the self, the purpose and essence of which I sought to learn. It was the self, I wanted to free myself from, which I sought to overcome. But I was not able to overcome it, could only deceive it, could only flee from it, only hide from it. Truly, no thing in this world has kept my thoughts thus busy, as this my very own self, this mystery of me being alive, of me being one and being separated and isolated from all others, of me being Siddhartha! And there is no thing in this world I know less about than about me, about Siddhartha!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个思索者走得更慢了，边走边问自己：“你原来想通过聆听教诲从老师那儿学到的东西到底是什么呢？曾经给过你许多教诲的人却无法教给你的东西又是什么呢？”他认为，“那是自我，我要学的就是自我的意义和本质。我要摆脱和克服的就是自我。但是我没能克服它，只能蒙哄它，只能避开它，只能躲起来。真的，世上万物中只有这个自我让我费尽了心思，也就是这个谜：我活着，我是一个人，与其他所有人都不同，我是席特哈尔塔！我对世上万物了解得远比对我自己、对席特哈尔塔更多！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Having been pondering while slowly walking along, he now stopped as these thoughts caught hold of him, and right away another thought sprang forth from these, a new thought, which was: "That I know nothing about myself, that Siddhartha has remained thus alien and unknown to me, stems from one cause, a single cause: I was afraid of myself, I was fleeing from myself! I searched Atman, I searched Brahman, I was willing to to dissect my self and peel off all of its layers, to find the core of all peels in its unknown interior, the Atman, life, the divine part, the ultimate part. But I have lost myself in the process."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个缓缓前行的思考者停下了脚步，完全陷入这想法之中，接着，从这个想法又冒出了另一个想法，一个新想法，那就是：“我对自己一无所知，对席特哈尔塔极为，陌生，很不了解，其原因只有一个：我害怕自己，回避自己！我寻求阿特曼，我寻求婆罗门，我情愿分割和剥离自我，以便在不为人所知的内心深处找到一切皮肉的内在核心，也就是找到阿特曼，找到生活，找到神性，找到最终的东西，而自我却迷失不见了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Siddhartha opened his eyes and looked around, a smile filled his face and a feeling of awakening from long dreams flowed through him from his head down to his toes. And it was not long before he walked again, walked quickly like a man who knows what he has got to do.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="席特哈尔塔睁开眼睛，环顾四周，脸上露出了笑容，一种从悠悠长梦中醒来的感觉传遍他全身，一直传到了脚趾。他又迈开步子，快跑起来，正如一个知道自己要去做什么的男子汉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He looked around, as if he was seeing the world for the first time. Beautiful was the world, colourful was the world, strange and mysterious was the world! Here was blue, here was yellow, here was green, the sky and the river flowed, the forest and the mountains were rigid, all of it was beautiful, all of it was mysterious and magical, and in its midst was he, Siddhartha, the awakening one, on the path to himself. All of this, all this yellow and blue, river and forest, entered Siddhartha for the first time through the eyes, was no longer a spell of Mara, was no longer the veil of Maya, was no longer a pointless and coincidental diversity of mere appearances, despicable to the deeply thinking Brahman, who scorns diversity, who seeks unity. Blue was blue, river was river, and if also in the blue and the river, in Siddhartha, the singular and divine lived hidden, so it was still that very divinity's way and purpose, to be here yellow, here blue, there sky, there forest, and here Siddhartha. The purpose and theessential properties were not somewhere behind the things, they were in them, in everything.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他环视四周，就好像是第一次见到这个世界。世界多么美好，世界多么绚丽，世界多么奇妙和迷人！这儿有蓝色，有黄色，有绿色，天空在流动，河流也在流动，森林高高耸立，山岭也高高耸立，一切都十分美丽，一切都十分神秘和不可思议，而席特哈尔塔置身其中，他是个正在觉醒的人，正走在通向自我的路上。所有这一切，这黄色和蓝色，这河流和森林，第一次通过眼睛进入席特哈尔塔内心，不再是玛拉的法术，不再是玛雅的面纱，不再是现象世界毫无意义和偶然的繁复多样，而对于这个鄙弃繁复多样并寻求和谐统一的婆罗门来说却算不得什么。蓝色就是蓝色，河流就是河流，即便在席特哈尔塔眼里，蓝色与河流中潜藏着神性，那也是神性的方式和意义。这边是黄色，是蓝色，那边是天空，是森林，而席特哈尔塔就在这里。内容和本质并不是在事物后面的什么地方，而是在事物内部，在所有事物之中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh," he thought, taking a deep breath, "now I would not let Siddhartha escape from me again! No longer, I want to begin my thoughts and my life with Atman and with the suffering of the world. I do not want to kill and dissect myself any longer, to find a secret behind the ruins. Neither Yoga-Veda shall teach me any more, nor Atharva-Veda, nor the ascetics, nor any kind of teachings. I want to learn from myself, want to be my student, want to get to know myself, the secret of Siddhartha."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，”他深深地吸了一口气，心想，“现在我不再让席特哈尔塔逃脱我了！我不再以阿特曼和尘世的烦恼来开始我的思考和生活了。我不愿再杀戮和分割自己，以便在残骸后面发现一个秘密了。我不想再学《耶柔吠陀》，不想再学《阿闼婆吠陀》，不想再当苦行僧，也不想再信奉什么学说了。我要向自个儿学，当个小学生，了解我自己，了解席特哈尔塔的秘密。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"How deaf and stupid have I been!" he thought, walking swiftly along. "When someone reads a text, wants to discover its meaning, he will not scorn the symbols and letters and call them deceptions, coincidence, and worthless hull, but he will read them, he will study and love them, letter by letter. But I, who wanted to read the book of the world and the book of my own being, I have, for the sake of a meaning I had anticipated before I read, scorned the symbols and letters, I called the visible world a deception, called my eyes and my tongue coincidental and worthless forms without substance. No, this is over, I have awakened, I have indeed awakened and have not been born before this very day."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我是多么麻木和迟钝啊！”这个匆匆前行的人心想，“如果一个人读一篇文章，其内容正是他要寻找的，那么，他就不会看不起那些符号和字母，称它们为错觉、偶然和没有价值的皮毛，而是逐字逐句地仔细阅读，钻研和热爱它们。而我呢，我想阅读世界这本书，阅读我自己的本质这本书，却为了取悦一个预先臆测的含义，轻视 些符号和字母，我称现象的世界为错觉，称我的眼睛和舌头为偶然和无价值的现象。不，这已经过去了，我已经醒来了，我确实已经觉醒了，今天才刚刚新生！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Because suddenly, he had also become aware of this: He, who was indeed like someone who had just woken up or like a new-born baby, he had to start his life anew and start again at the very beginning. When he had left in this very morning from the grove Jetavana, the grove of that exalted one, already awakening, already on the path towards himself, he he had every intention, regarded as natural and took for granted, that he, after years as an ascetic, would return to his home and his father. But now, only in this moment, when he stopped as if a snake was lying on his path, he also awoke to this realization: "But I am no longer the one I was, I am no ascetic any more, I am not a priest any more, I am no Brahman any more. Whatever should I do at home and at my father's place? Study? Make offerings? Practise meditation? But all this is over, all of this is no longer alongside my path."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是因为他突然还明白了一点：他实际上就像一个觉醒者或者新生者，必须从头开始他的生活，完全从头开始。当天早上他离开耶塔瓦纳林苑，离开那个活佛的林苑时，他已经开始觉醒，已经在通向自我的道路上了，这正是他的目的。在经过多年苦修之后，他觉得回家乡去看望父亲是理所当然和不言而喻的。但是现在，就在他停住脚，仿佛有一条蛇横在他路上这一瞬间，他又清醒地认识到：“我不再是原来的我，不再是苦修者，不再是僧侣，不再是婆罗门了。我回到家在父亲身边又能做什么呢？钻研？祭祀？沉思潜修？这一切都过去了，这一切都不再挡着我的路了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Motionless, Siddhartha remained standing there, and for the time of one moment and breath, his heart felt cold, he felt a cold in his chest, as a small animal, a bird or a rabbit, would when seeing how alone he was. For many years, he had been without home and had felt nothing. Now, he felt it. Still, even in the deepest meditation, he had been his father's son, had been a Brahman, of a high caste, a cleric. Now, he was nothing but Siddhartha, the awoken one, nothing else was left. Deeply, he inhaled, and for a moment, he felt cold and shivered. Nobody was thus alone as he was. There was no nobleman who did not belong to the noblemen, no worker that did not belong to the workers, and found refuge with them, shared their life, spoke their language. No Brahman, who would not be regarded as Brahmans and lived with them, no ascetic who would not find his refuge in the caste of the Samanas, and even the most forlorn hermit in the forest was not just one and alone, he was also surrounded by a place he belonged to, he also belonged to a caste, in which he was at home. Govinda had become a monk, and a thousand monks were his brothers, wore the same robe as he, believed in his faith, spoke his language. But he, Siddhartha, where did he belong to? With whom would he share his life? Whose language would he speak?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="席特哈尔塔一动不动地站着，他的心冷了一下，感到心在胸口中很冷很冷，就像一只小动物，就像一只鸟儿或一只免子，他看到了自己是多么孤独。多年来他没有家，流落四方，没有这种感受，而今天却感觉到了。即使在以前的潜修中，他依然是他父亲的儿子，是婆罗门，地位高贵，是个有教养的人。而现在他只是席特哈尔塔，一个觉醒者，除此之外便什么也不是了。他深深地吸气，有一瞬间感到浑身发冷，颤栗不已，没有谁像他这么孤独。没有一个贵族不属于贵族们，没有一个工匠不属于工匠们，同时还求助于他们，分享他们的生活，说他们的语言。没有一个婆罗门不属于所有婆罗门，和他们在一起生活。没有一个苦行僧不求助于沙门这个阶层。就连森林中与世隔绝的隐士，也不是孤零零的一个人，他周围也有附属的东西，他也属于一个阶层，那就是他的家。戈文达当了和尚，上千的和尚都是他的弟兄，穿着他的衣服，信奉他的信仰，讲他的语言。但是他，席特哈尔塔，他属于哪儿呢？他分享谁的生活？他讲谁的语言呢？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Out of this moment, when the world melted away all around him, when he stood alone like a star in the sky, out of this moment of a cold and despair, Siddhartha emerged, more a self than before, more firmly concentrated. He felt: This had been the last tremor of the awakening, the last struggle of this birth. And it was not long until he walked again in long strides, started to proceed swiftly and impatiently, heading no longer for home, no longer to his father, no longer back.</div>
