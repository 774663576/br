<div class="line_en">Harry felt happier for the rest of the weekend than he had done all term. He and Ron spent much of Sunday catching up with all their homework again, and although this could hardly be called fun, the last burst of autumn sunshine persisted, so rather than sitting hunched over tables in the common room they took their work outside and lounged in the shade of a large beech tree on the edge of the lake. Hermione, who of course was up to date with all her work, brought more wool outside with her and bewitched her knitting needles so that they flashed and clicked in midair beside her, producing more hats and scarves.</div>

<div class="line_en">Knowing they were doing something to resist Umbridge and the Ministry and that he was a key part of the rebellion, gave Harry a feeling of immense satisfaction. He kept reliving Saturdays meeting in his mind: all those people, coming to him to learn Defence Against the Dark Arts… and the looks on their faces as they had heard some of the things he had done… and Cho praising his performance in the Triwizard Tournament -- knowing all those people did not think him a lying weirdo, but someone to be admired, buoyed him up so much that he was still cheerful on Monday morning, despite the imminent prospect of all his least favourite classes.</div>

<div class="line_en">Once outside the room, Harry returned Hedwig to his shoulder and hurried off up the corridor, pausing to think only when he was out of sight of Binns's door.

<div class="line_cn" title="他透过窗户朝狂风大作、阴云笼罩的场地上张望着。海格的小屋附近看不到她的踪影，如果没在上课，她可能在教师办公室。他往楼下跑去，海德薇在他肩上摇晃，微弱地叫着。">查看中文翻译</div>

"I should be able to sort this out if you leave her with me, Potter," she said, "she shouldn't be flying long distances for a few days, in any case."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="格拉普兰教授从袍子里抽出一只镜片，安到她的眼睛上，仔细检查海德薇的翅膀。“如果你把它留在我这儿，我应该可以查清楚，波特。”她说，“反正它几天内不应长途飞行。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Hi," chorused Harry, Ron and Hermione, all three kneeling down on the hearthrug. Crookshanks purred loudly and approached the fire, trying, despite the heat, to put his face close to Sirius's.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你好！”哈利、罗恩和赫敏同声说，三人都跪到壁炉前的地毯上。克鲁克山喵喵叫着凑近炉火，不顾灼热，想去亲小天狼星的脸。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a long while before the crowd around the Weasley twins dispersed, then Fred, Lee and George sat up counting their takings even longer, so it was well past midnight when Harry, Ron and Hermione finally had the common room to themselves. At long last, Fred had closed the doorway to the boys' dormitories behind him, rattling his box of Galleons ostentatiously so that Hermione scowled. Harry, who was making very little progress with his Potions essay, decided to give it up for the night. As he put his books away, Ron, who was dozing lightly in an armchair, gave a muffled grunt, awoke, and looked blearily into the fire. "Sirius!" he said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="韦斯莱兄弟周围的人群很晚才散去，然后弗雷德、李和乔治又坐在那里数钱，午夜过后很久，罗恩和赫敏总算可以享有公共休息室的清静了。弗雷德终于关上了通往男生宿舍的门，炫耀地摇着他的钱盒子，惹得赫敏皱起眉头。哈利的文章没写几个字，他决定今晚放弃了。他收拾书本的时候，在扶手椅上打瞌睡的罗恩哼了一声醒过来，迷糊地望着火焰说：“小天狼星！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Not that good," said Harry, as Hermione pulled Crookshanks back to stop him singeing his whiskers. "The Ministry's forced through another decree, which means we're not allowed to have Quidditch teams --"</div>
