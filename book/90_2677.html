<div class="line_en">We have a great deal more kindness than is ever spoken. Maugre all the selfishness that chills like east winds the world, the whole human family is bathed with an element of love like a fine ether. How many persons we meet in houses, whom we scarcely speak to, whom yet we honor, and who honor us! How many we see in the street, or sit with in church, whom, though silently, we warmly rejoice to be with! Read the language of these wandering eye-beams. The heart knoweth.</div>

<div class="line_en">The effect of the indulgence of this human affection is a certain cordial exhilaration. In poetry, and in common speech, the emotions of benevolence and complacency which are felt towards others are likened to the material effects of fire; so swift, or much more swift, more active, more cheering, are these fine inward irradiations. From the highest degree of passionate love, to the lowest degree of good-will, they make the sweetness of life.</div>

<div class="line_en">Our intellectual and active powers increase with our affection. The scholar sits down to write, and all his years of meditation do not furnish him with one good thought or happy expression; but it is necessary to write a letter to a friend, -- and, forthwith, troops of gentle thoughts invest themselves, on every hand, with chosen words. See, in any house where virtue and self-respect abide, the palpitation which the approach of a stranger causes. A commended stranger is expected and announced, and an uneasiness betwixt pleasure and pain invades all the hearts of a household. His arrival almost brings fear to the good hearts that would welcome him. The house is dusted, all things fly into their places, the old coat is exchanged for the new, and they must get up a dinner if they can. Of a commended stranger, only the good report is told by others, only the good and new is heard by us. He stands to us for humanity. He is what we wish. Having imagined and invested him, we ask how we should stand related in conversation and action with such a man, and are uneasy with fear. The same idea exalts conversation with him. We talk better than we are wont. We have the nimblest fancy, a richer memory, and our dumb devil has taken leave for the time. For long hours we can continue a series of sincere, graceful, rich communications, drawn from the oldest, secretest experience, so that they who sit by, of our own kinsfolk and acquaintance, shall feel a lively surprise at our unusual powers. But as soon as the stranger begins to intrude his partialities, his definitions, his defects, into the conversation, it is all over. He has heard the first, the last and best he will ever hear from us. He is no stranger now. Vulgarity, ignorance, misapprehension are old acquaintances. Now, when he comes, he may get the order, the dress, and the dinner, -- but the throbbing of the heart, and the communications of the soul, no more.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们情感的成长离不开智力与活力的增长。如果一个学者开始写作，但他那许多年的苦苦思索也没寻找到一条精辟的想法或令自己满意的观点，那么这时他放松心境，给好友写封信怎么样？这时他会思维开拓，奇思佳句就会信手拈来，再不会因为字句的选择而烦恼。值得注意的是，一位陌生客人的造访，会让每个推崇德行与自尊的人家引起一阵慌乱。当宣告这位备受期待的陌生人到来时，人们心里马上被一股不安的情绪所侵扰，这是一种介于苦与乐之间的不安情绪。这些欢迎他的人心里，必然会因他的出现而忧虑。屋子被打扫得干干净净，所有的东西都被摆在了合适的位置，人们都换上了节日时才会穿的新衣服，要是条件允许，他们还得准备一场盛大的欢迎会。对于一个备受推荐的陌生来宾，我们只听到关于他的赞美之词以及相关的好消息。他对我们来说就是人性的代表，也正是我们努力寻求的东西。当我们把来人琢磨后，会产生这样的想法：我们该如何表现出对来客的尊敬？我们会为此心事重重，难以安心。在这种想法的驱使下，我们表现出比平常更优雅的说话方式，让我们提高了与他的谈话水准。我们畅所欲言，这段时间里，沉默这种“魔物”没有了踪影。这种真诚、高雅、丰富的谈话，我们可以继续很久，这都源自我们所积累的古老、秘密的经验，所以与我相处的家人或朋友都会为我的谈吐感到吃惊。这位客人只要把他的嗜好、学说、缺点说出来，这一切也就结束了。他听到了我们所能说的所有话，最开始的，最好的，最后的。这时，对于我们来说，他已经不再是陌生人了。庸俗、愚昧、误解都变得常见起来。虽然在他再次来访时，我们依然会热烈欢迎，可是已经不再会有心灵间的对话。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">What is so pleasant as these jets of affection which make a young world for me again? What so delicious as a just and firm encounter of two, in a thought, in a feeling? How beautiful, on their approach to this beating heart, the steps and forms of the gifted and the true! The moment we indulge our affections, the earth is metamorphosed; there is no winter, and no night; all tragedies, all ennuis, vanish, -- all duties even; nothing fills the proceeding eternity but the forms all radiant of beloved persons. Let the soul be assured that somewhere in the universe it should rejoin its friend, and it would be content and cheerful alone for a thousand years.</div>

<div class="line_en">I awoke this morning with devout thanksgiving for my friends, the old and the new. Shall I not call God the Beautiful, who daily showeth himself so to me in his gifts? I chide society, I embrace solitude, and yet I am not so ungrateful as not to see the wise, the lovely, and the noble-minded, as from time to time they pass my gate. Who hears me, who understands me, becomes mine, -- a possession for all time. Nor is nature so poor but she gives me this joy several times, and thus we weave social threads of our own, a new web of relations; and, as many thoughts in succession substantiate themselves, we shall by and by stand in a new world of our own creation, and no longer strangers and pilgrims in a traditionary globe. My friends have come to me unsought. The great God gave them to me. By oldest right, by the divine affinity of virtue with itself, I find them, or rather not I, but the Deity in me and in them derides and cancels the thick walls of individual character, relation, age, sex, circumstance, at which he usually connives, and now makes many one. High thanks I owe you, excellent lovers, who carry out the world for me to new and noble depths, and enlarge the meaning of all my thoughts. These are new poetry of the first Bard, -- poetry without stop, -- hymn, ode, and epic, poetry still flowing, Apollo and the Muses chanting still. Will these, too, separate themselves from me again, or some of them? I know not, but I fear it not; for my relation to them is so pure, that we hold by simple affinity, and the Genius of my life being thus social, the same affinity will exert its energy on whomsoever is as noble as these men and women, wherever I may be.</div>

<div class="line_en">Yet the systole and diastole of the heart are not without their analogy in the ebb and flow of love. Friendship, like the immortality of the soul, is too good to be believed. The lover, beholding his maiden, half knows that she is not verily that which he worships; and in the golden hour of friendship, we are surprised with shades of suspicion and unbelief. We doubt that we bestow on our hero the virtues in which he shines, and afterwards worship the form to which we have ascribed this divine inhabitation. In strictness, the soul does not respect men as it respects itself. In strict science all persons underlie the same condition of an infinite remoteness. Shall we fear to cool our love by mining for the metaphysical foundation of this Elysian temple? Shall I not be as real as the things I see? If I am, I shall not fear to know them for what they are. Their essence is not less beautiful than their appearance, though it needs finer organs for its apprehension. The root of the plant is not unsightly to science, though for chaplets and festoons we cut the stem short. And I must hazard the production of the bald fact amidst these pleasing reveries, though it should prove an Egyptian skull at our banquet. A man who stands united with his thought conceives magnificently of himself. He is conscious of a universal success, even though bought by uniform particular failures. No advantages, no powers, no gold or force, can be any match for him. I cannot choose but rely on my own poverty more than on your wealth. I cannot make your consciousness tantamount to mine. Only the star dazzles; the planet has a faint, moon-like ray. I hear what you say of the admirable parts and tried temper of the party you praise, but I see well that for all his purple cloaks I shall not like him, unless he is at last a poor Greek like me. I cannot deny it, O friend, that the vast shadow of the Phenomenal includes thee also in its pied and painted immensity, -- thee, also, compared with whom all else is shadow. Thou art not Being, as Truth is, as Justice is, -- thou art not my soul, but a picture and effigy of that. Thou hast come to me lately, and already thou art seizing thy hat and cloak. Is it not that the soul puts forth friends as the tree puts forth leaves, and presently, by the germination of new buds, extrudes the old leaf? The law of nature is alternation for evermore. Each electrical state superinduces the opposite. The soul environs itself with friends, that it may enter into a grander self-acquaintance or solitude; and it goes alone for a season, that it may exalt its conversation or society. This method betrays itself along the whole history of our personal relations. The instinct of affection revives the hope of union with our mates, and the returning sense of insulation recalls us from the chase. Thus every man passes his life in the search after friendship, and if he should record his true sentiment, he might write a letter like this to each new candidate for his love.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="情郎对于他眼中的爱人，心底也许会觉得她还是有些瑕疵的。然而，当一对要好的朋友之间，出现一点点的怀疑都会让我们感到不可思议。我们怀疑英雄是否取得了那令他闪耀的美德，而后来又对这圣灵寄居的那个形体顶礼膜拜。严格来说，灵魂对人的敬意不如对自己般的尊重。就科学的角度来说，每个人都在一个永恒的遥远之中。我们的爱会因为我们挖掘出圣殿形而上的基础而冷却，这是我们担心的吗？我会变得不真实，变得不像我所看见的事物那样实在？要是这样，我就不会害怕探寻到朋友们的秘密。他们表里如一，都是一样的美，虽然我们要靠更加敏锐的感官来理解这种美。植物的根从科学的角度并不显得难看，为了花冠和花球的好看我们会去剔除一些根茎。哪怕以后将会证明这将会是宴会上的一具埃及骷髅，我们也必须把它在我们遐想里的掩饰剥离下来。一个自命不凡的人一定是与自己思想保持同步的人。他所领悟的是一种普遍的成功法则，这是靠不懈的失败积累取得的。所有的优点，能力，金钱和力量都无法与之抗衡。我虽然只能靠自己的贫困而活，但我不会去觊觎你的财富。我无法与你达成一致的思想。光彩夺目的都是恒星，行星那点微光是连月亮都比不上的。你赞扬那一方观点的话语我都听到了，虽然那一方在你的描叙里具有无上的才华与气质，可是，尽管他是如此的高贵，我还是无法喜欢上他，除非他变得像我一样贫困。我的朋友啊，你也被“现象”的巨大阴影笼罩住了，与你比较，其他的一切也全部成了影子。真理、正义是真正的存在，就如同我的灵魂一样，可你不是“存在”，你只是一副灵魂的肖像。你不久前才来到此地，可你现在已经收拾好衣服要离开了。永恒的更替就是一种自然法则，朋友间的交往也是这样。树叶长出新芽就会赶走旧叶，灵魂生出朋友也是一样的道理，会不断有新朋友来填补老朋友的位置。每一个令人始料未及的状态都会导致事与愿违。灵魂被围在了朋友中间，它因此进入了一种更高贵的境界，对自我的透彻剖析或者单独思考的境地；它独处一段时间后，它的谈话与交流也会得以升华。这种方法能把自己完全表露出来，在代表全部个人关系的历史里。感情中的本能让我们重燃了渴求与伴侣结合的愿望，可是在追求的途中，回归的孤立感又让我们返回了。这就让每个人在寻求友谊的道路上走完了一生，要是他忠实写下自己的真实感受，他能写下这样一封信，一封可以献给他所有喜爱对象的信。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I confess to an extreme tenderness of nature on this point. It is almost dangerous to me to "crush the sweet poison of misused wine" of the affections. A new person is to me a great event, and hinders me from sleep. I have often had fine fancies about persons which have given me delicious hours; but the joy ends in the day; it yields no fruit. Thought is not born of it; my action is very little modified. I must feel pride in my friend's accomplishments as if they were mine, -- and a property in his virtues. I feel as warmly when he is praised, as the lover when he hears applause of his engaged maiden. We over-estimate the conscience of our friend. His goodness seems better than our goodness, his nature finer, his temptations less. Every thing that is his, -- his name, his form, his dress, books, and instruments, -- fancy enhances. Our own thought sounds new and larger from his mouth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对于这一方面，在我看来天性是极为脆弱的。把感情中“不慎饮下的酒里甜美的毒药排挤出去”在我眼里，这简直是危险的行径。一个新人的来到是让我夜不能寐的大事。对于给了我美好时光的人我是特别喜欢的，可这种欢乐一到白天就结束了，不会有任何后果产生。它也不具有思考能力，我也很少为此改变自己的行动。对于朋友的成就，我要为此而感到光荣，就像那些成就是我参与了的，就如同他德行中具有了这一特性一样。我会为他受到的表扬而高兴，就如同别人是在夸奖我的未婚妻一样。我们会过高地评价我们朋友的良心。他有着比我们更善良的心，有着比我们更加纯真的天性，受到比我们更少的诱惑。连属于我们自己的思想，只要出自于他的口，都会看上去新鲜深刻了不少。只要是他拥有的一切事物，名字、样貌、穿着、书本和工具，都在我们的幻想里美化了。爱的消长就如同我们自己的心脏收缩扩张一样。友谊就如同不朽的灵魂一样，好得令人惊讶。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Yet these uneasy pleasures and fine pains are for curiosity, and not for life. They are not to be indulged. This is to weave cobweb, and not cloth. Our friendships hurry to short and poor conclusions, because we have made them a texture of wine and dreams, instead of the tough fibre of the human heart. The laws of friendship are austere and eternal, of one web with the laws of nature and of morals. But we have aimed at a swift and petty benefit, to suck a sudden sweetness. We snatch at the slowest fruit in the whole garden of God, which many summers and many winters must ripen. We seek our friend not sacredly, but with an adulterate passion which would appropriate him to ourselves. In vain. We are armed all over with subtle antagonisms, which, as soon as we meet, begin to play, and translate all poetry into stale prose. Almost all people descend to meet. All association must be a compromise, and, what is worst, the very flower and aroma of the flower of each of the beautiful natures disappears as they approach each other. What a perpetual disappointment is actual society, even of the virtuous and gifted! After interviews have been compassed with long foresight, we must be tormented presently by baffled blows, by sudden, unseasonable apathies, by epilepsies of wit and of animal spirits, in the heyday of friendship and thought. Our faculties do not play us true, and both parties are relieved by solitude.</div>

<div class="line_en">Our impatience is thus sharply rebuked. Bashfulness and apathy are a tough husk, in which a delicate organization is protected from premature ripening. It would be lost if it knew itself before any of the best souls were yet ripe enough to know and own it. Respect the naturlangsamkeit which hardens the ruby in a million years, and works in duration, in which Alps and Andes come and go as rainbows. The good spirit of our life has no heaven which is the price of rashness. Love, which is the essence of God, is not for levity, but for the total worth of man.

<div class="line_en">I do not wish to treat friendships daintily, but with roughest courage. When they are real, they are not glass threads or frostwork, but the solidest thing we know. For now, after so many ages of experience, what do we know of nature, or of ourselves? Not one step has man taken toward the solution of the problem of his destiny. In one condemnation of folly stand the whole universe of men. But the sweet sincerity of joy and peace, which I draw from this alliance with my brother's soul, is the nut itself, whereof all nature and all thought is but the husk and shell. Happy is the house that shelters a friend! It might well be built, like a festal bower or arch, to entertain him a single day. Happier, if he know the solemnity of that relation, and honor its law! He who offers himself a candidate for that covenant comes up, like an Olympian, to the great games, where the first-born of the world are the competitors. He proposes himself for contests where Time, Want, Danger, are in the lists, and he alone is victor who has truth enough in his constitution to preserve the delicacy of his beauty from the wear and tear of all these. The gifts of fortune may be present or absent, but all the speed in that contest depends on intrinsic nobleness, and the contempt of trifles. There are two elements that go to the composition of friendship, each so sovereign that I can detect no superiority in either, no reason why either should be first named. One is Truth. A friend is a person with whom I may be sincere. Before him I may think aloud. I am arrived at last in the presence of a man so real and equal, that I may drop even those undermost garments of dissimulation, courtesy, and second thought, which men never put off, and may deal with him with the simplicity and wholeness with which one chemical atom meets another. Sincerity is the luxury allowed, like diadems and authority, only to the highest rank, that being permitted to speak truth, as having none above it to court or conform unto. Every man alone is sincere. At the entrance of a second person, hypocrisy begins. We parry and fend the approach of our fellow-man by compliments, by gossip, by amusements, by affairs. We cover up our thought from him under a hundred folds. I knew a man, who, under a certain religious frenzy, cast off this drapery, and, omitting all compliment and commonplace, spoke to the conscience of every person he encountered, and that with great insight and beauty. At first he was resisted, and all men agreed he was mad. But persisting, as indeed he could not help doing, for some time in this course, he attained to the advantage of bringing every man of his acquaintance into true relations with him. No man would think of speaking falsely with him, or of putting him off with any chat of markets or reading-rooms. But every man was constrained by so much sincerity to the like plaindealing, and what love of nature, what poetry, what symbol of truth he had, he did certainly show him. But to most of us society shows not its face and eye, but its side and its back. To stand in true relations with men in a false age is worth a fit of insanity, is it not? We can seldom go erect. Almost every man we meet requires some civility, -- requires to be humored; he has some fame, some talent, some whim of religion or philanthropy in his head that is not to be questioned, and which spoils all conversation with him. But a friend is a sane man who exercises not my ingenuity, but me. My friend gives me entertainment without requiring any stipulation on my part. A friend, therefore, is a sort of paradox in nature. I who alone am, I who see nothing in nature whose existence I can affirm with equal evidence to my own, behold now the semblance of my being, in all its height, variety, and curiosity, reiterated in a foreign form; so that a friend may well be reckoned the masterpiece of nature.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对待友谊，我不想精雕细作，只愿放开手脚去改革。友谊只要是真诚的，就不会如玻璃丝般易断，不会如窗上的霜花那般容易消融，而是如同我们心里认为的，那个最坚实的东西一般的存在。累积了许多时代的经验，到了今天，对于自然界，对于我们自己，我们依然还是不够了解。对于我们命运问题的解决，我们还没有任何有效的行动。我们都对愚蠢报以批评。所有性格只不过是一个外壳，我在我兄弟的灵魂里吸取到的甜蜜、和平、真诚和愉悦才是中心的果实。用来保护一位友人的房屋是幸运的。不如将它改造成庭园或拱门用以接待他。要是他明白这种关系是庄严的，并对它的规律表以敬意，那它就更加幸运了！最先提议订立那种盟约的人，就如同重大比赛里的一位奥林匹斯神，他会把世界上最年长的人都当做自己的对手。他主动要求参加各种比赛。他的名册上都是“时间”、“贫乏”、“危险”的名字，优胜者性格里一定具有足够的真诚，靠它保护他鲜艳的美。运气可能存在于天赋中，也可能不在，可是你领先的速度最终是靠你固有的高贵品质与对小事的轻视态度来决定的。两种元素构成了友谊，我无法在它们之中评判出谁更高贵，都是一样的高雅，没有先后之别。一种叫做“真”。朋友是能让我肝胆相照的人，是真诚的人。在他面前，我的谈话可以没有任何顾忌；面对他，我无须任何遮掩；在他面前，我可以把在别人面前我们不敢离身的礼貌与周详思考都扔掉。我们的会面，就如同是两个原子纯粹的相遇。真诚就如同国王的王冠与权威，是至高无上的人才能拥有的，他得到了世界上的一切，没有再让他祈求得到的东西了，他可以自由地说着真话。在对待自己时每个人都是真诚的。当有人踏入他的世界，伪善就环绕在他们之间了。对于我们同类的到来，我们总是用问候、用闲谈、用娱乐、用挑逗去回避他们，阻止他们。我们为了不让他知道，为自己的思想裹上了重重的包装。我认识过这样一个人，他因为对他信奉宗教的狂热，丢弃了这些掩饰，再也不会有矫情的恭维与客套，对遇见的每个人他都是真诚以待，带着洞察和美与他们的良心谈话。最开始，他被人抵制，每个人都说他发疯了。但是他没有放弃，而他轻而易举地就可以放弃。时间一久，他的坚持有了回报，谁也不会对他说谎，他认识的每一人跟他建立了真正的关系，这些人对他也都很真诚。这么多的真诚让每个人都会去坦白直率地行事，他对自然是如何的喜爱，他有着何种的高雅爱好，他有着什么样的真理，他有…他自然会展示给所有人。但是，对于我们大多数人而言，社交让人看到的不是它的脸庞和眼睛，只是它的侧面和背影。在一个虚假的世界里，与人们保持真诚的关系就如同是疯了一样，我们无法坦坦荡荡地行事。朋友却有着清醒的认识，他不会为了我的聪敏，而有所顾忌。他只是热情地招待我，却不求我为他做些什么。而如果不是朋友，那么你遇见的每一个人都需要客套或者迁就。比如他是个名人，有着许多的才华，充满着许多新奇的思想，可这些东西也正好毁了与他的所有谈话。朋友这样看来就像是自然界的一个悖论。我是独立的存在，我在自然界里没有任何东西，自然界存在的证据同样能证明我的存在，现在我看见了与我的高度、品种和特性都相仿的事物，只是换了一种形式展现出来，这个叫做朋友的事物可以说是大自然最杰出的作品。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The other element of friendship is tenderness. We are holden to men by every sort of tie, by blood, by pride, by fear, by hope, by lucre, by lust, by hate, by admiration, by every circumstance and badge and trifle, but we can scarce believe that so much character can subsist in another as to draw us by love. Can another be so blessed, and we so pure, that we can offer him tenderness? When a man becomes dear to me, I have touched the goal of fortune. I find very little written directly to the heart of this matter in books. And yet I have one text which I cannot choose but remember. My author says, -- "I offer myself faintly and bluntly to those whose I effectually am, and tender myself least to him to whom I am the most devoted." I wish that friendship should have feet, as well as eyes and eloquence. It must plant itself on the ground, before it vaults over the moon. I wish it to be a little of a citizen, before it is quite a cherub. We chide the citizen because he makes love a commodity. It is an exchange of gifts, of useful loans; it is good neighbourhood; it watches with the sick; it holds the pall at the funeral; and quite loses sight of the delicacies and nobility of the relation. But though we cannot find the god under this disguise of a sutler, yet, on the other hand, we cannot forgive the poet if he spins his thread too fine, and does not substantiate his romance by the municipal virtues of justice, punctuality, fidelity, and pity. I hate the prostitution of the name of friendship to signify modish and worldly alliances. I much prefer the company of ploughboys and tin-peddlers, to the silken and perfumed amity which celebrates its days of encounter by a frivolous display, by rides in a curricle, and dinners at the best taverns. The end of friendship is a commerce the most strict and homely that can be joined; more strict than any of which we have experience. It is for aid and comfort through all the relations and passages of life and death. It is fit for serene days, and graceful gifts, and country rambles, but also for rough roads and hard fare, shipwreck, poverty, and persecution. It keeps company with the sallies of the wit and the trances of religion. We are to dignify to each other the daily needs and offices of man's life, and embellish it by courage, wisdom, and unity. It should never fall into something usual and settled, but should be alert and inventive, and add rhyme and reason to what was drudgery.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="柔情是友谊的另外一种元素。血统、自尊、恐惧、希望、金钱、爱情、仇恨、敬佩这些纽带将我们与他人联系在了一起，可是，我们对另一个人所具有这么多特点抱有怀疑，所以他要用爱来吸引我们。另外一个人会如此神圣？我们能做出那么单纯的举动，向他透露我们的柔情？一个人被我所喜爱，我也就幸运地达到了我的目的。在我看来，书上写的东西无法让人们了解到问题的关键。蒙田有一句名言——“我没有刻意地去把自己献给那些人，可实际上我就是他们的，我奉献的最少的也就是我最效忠的那些。”我希望友谊不能只有观察的眼睛，善于言辞的嘴，还必须有一双坚强有力的大脚，这样它才能跃过月亮。我希望它首先是作为一个普通百姓，而后才是天使。我们埋怨那个普通百姓，爱在他手上成为了一种商品。它是一种交易；它是好邻居；它是个好护士；临终，它送我们离去；这种关系的难以琢磨和崇高却不被我们所留意。就算我们注意不到化装成小商贩的神灵，但是如果诗人不在他的传奇故事里加入公正、准时、忠诚、怜悯这样的美德，我们也是不会谅解他的。我对那些滥用友谊之名去表示时髦或是低俗的关系的行为深恶痛绝，那些浮华喧嚣的小人之交在我眼里远不如市井之民平淡如水般的交往。能参与的最严格最朴实的社交活动就是友谊的意义体现，它的严格是其他社交无法比拟的。它所追求的援助与安乐是通过所有关系的生死考验得来的。宁静的生活、雅致的情怀、乡村的漫步这才是适合它的，但是对于崎岖的山路、粗陋的食物、沉船、贫瘠还有迫害它也能欣然接受的。它喜爱连篇富有情趣的语言，也敬佩宗教里的心如止水。我们要把尊严融入到日常的生活与人生的职责里，让友谊在勇气、智慧、和谐的辉映下更显光辉。它不该被成规陋俗所束缚，应该具有灵敏的感觉，富于开创，把韵律与情感注入单调乏味的东西里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Friendship may be said to require natures so rare and costly, each so well tempered and so happily adapted, and withal so circumstanced, (for even in that particular, a poet says, love demands that the parties be altogether paired,) that its satisfaction can very seldom be assured. It cannot subsist in its perfection, say some of those who are learned in this warm lore of the heart, betwixt more than two. I am not quite so strict in my terms, perhaps because I have never known so high a fellowship as others. I please my imagination more with a circle of godlike men and women variously related to each other, and between whom subsists a lofty intelligence. But I find this law of one to one peremptory for conversation, which is the practice and consummation of friendship. Do not mix waters too much. The best mix as ill as good and bad. You shall have very useful and cheering discourse at several times with two several men, but let all three of you come together, and you shall not have one new and hearty word. Two may talk and one may hear, but three cannot take part in a conversation of the most sincere and searching sort. In good company there is never such discourse between two, across the table, as takes place when you leave them alone. In good company, the individuals merge their egotism into a social soul exactly co-extensive with the several consciousnesses there present. No partialities of friend to friend, no fondnesses of brother to sister, of wife to husband, are there pertinent, but quite otherwise. Only he may then speak who can sail on the common thought of the party, and not poorly limited to his own. Now this convention, which good sense demands, destroys the high freedom of great conversation, which requires an absolute running of two souls into one.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="种种稀奇古怪、高贵的天性都是友谊所需要的，可是每一种都调和均匀，情境合适，这都难以让它满意。一些对这种热门心理学深有研究的人说，它无法在两个以上人的中间达到完美的境界。因为我可能从没有过别人那种深厚的友谊，所以我对于自己的定义并不严格。我宁愿让我的想象，在一种互相关系迥然不同的、神圣的男女圈子里得到满足，在他们之间有着一种高深的理解。可是我发现对话中这一对一的法则是不能忤逆的，而友谊也是要靠会话来实践和完成的。不要让事情变得复杂。让最好的都混在一个容器里，这样做就如同把坏的掺进好的里面一样糟糕。你把两个人隔开，单独与他们中的一个谈话，这一定会让你心情愉悦，受益良多。可是你与他们一起交谈，你就只能听到虚伪的陈词滥调了。两人之间进行的对话是融洽的，但绝对不会隔着桌子进行。三个人也可以畅谈，但那绝对不会是一场发自内心的真诚交流。在融洽的会谈中，在交际范围内同等的灵魂都融入了我们个人的思想。只有不局限在自己的思想里的人，才能在大家共同的思想天空中遨游，那时你才能发表言论。朋友间的偏爱，兄妹间的羁绊，夫妻间的爱恋，那里没有客观的反映，而是与事实背道而驰。因为会话需要两个灵魂的绝对融合，良知所要求的集会毁坏了卓绝交谈的自由性。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Friendship requires that rare mean betwixt likeness and unlikeness, that piques each with the presence of power and of consent in the other party. Let me be alone to the end of the world, rather than that my friend should overstep, by a word or a look, his real sympathy. I am equally balked by antagonism and by compliance. Let him not cease an instant to be himself. The only joy I have in his being mine, is that the not mine is mine. I hate, where I looked for a manly furtherance, or at least a manly resistance, to find a mush of concession. Better be a nettle in the side of your friend than his echo. The condition which high friendship demands is ability to do without it. That high office requires great and sublime parts. There must be very two, before there can be very one. Let it be an alliance of two large, formidable natures, mutually beheld, mutually feared, before yet they recognize the deep identity which beneath these disparities unites them.</div>

<div class="line_en">No two men but, being left alone with each other, enter into simpler relations. Yet it is affinity that determines which two shall converse. Unrelated men give little joy to each other; will never suspect the latent powers of each. We talk sometimes of a great talent for conversation, as if it were a permanent property in some individuals. Conversation is an evanescent relation, -- no more. A man is reputed to have thought and eloquence; he cannot, for all that, say a word to his cousin or his uncle. They accuse his silence with as much reason as they would blame the insignificance of a dial in the shade. In the sun it will mark the hour. Among those who enjoy his thought, he will regain his tongue.</div>

Why insist on rash personal relations with your friend? Why go to his house, or know his mother and brother and sisters? Why be visited by him at your own? Are these things material to our covenant? Leave this touching and clawing. Let him be to me a spirit. A message, a thought, a sincerity, a glance from him, I want, but not news, nor pottage. I can get politics, and chat, and neighbourly conveniences from cheaper companions. Should not the society of my friend be to me poetic, pure, universal, and great as nature itself? Ought I to feel that our tie is profane in comparison with yonder bar of cloud that sleeps on the horizon, or that clump of waving grass that divides the brook? Let us not vilify, but raise it to that standard. That great, defying eye, that scornful beauty of his mien and action, do not pique yourself on reducing, but rather fortify and enhance. Worship his superiorities; wish him not less by a thought, but hoard and tell them all. Guard him as thy counterpart. Let him be to thee for ever a sort of beautiful enemy, untamable, devoutly revered, and not a trivial conveniency to be soon outgrown and cast aside. The hues of the opal, the light of the diamond, are not to be seen, if the eye is too near. To my friend I write a letter, and from him I receive a letter. That seems to you a little. It suffices me. It is a spiritual gift worthy of him to give, and of me to receive. It profanes nobody.

There are innumerable degrees of folly and wisdom, and for you to say aught is to be frivolous. Wait, and thy heart shall speak. Wait until the necessary and everlasting overpowers you, until day and night avail themselves of your lips. The only reward of virtue is virtue; the only way to have a friend is to be one. You shall not come nearer a man by getting into his house. If unlike, his soul only flees the faster from you, and you shall never catch a true glance of his eye. We see the noble afar off, and they repel us; why should we intrude? Late, -- very late, -- we perceive that no arrangements, no introductions, no consuetudes or habits of society, would be of any avail to establish us in such relations with them as we desire, -- but solely the uprise of nature in us to the same degree it is in them; then shall we meet as water with water; and if we should not meet them then, we shall not want them, for we are already they.

I go in that I may seize them, I go out that I may seize them. I fear only that I may lose them receding into the sky in which now they are only a patch of brighter light. Then, though I prize my friends, I cannot afford to talk with them and study their visions, lest I lose my own. It would indeed give me a certain household joy to quit this lofty seeking, this spiritual astronomy, or search of stars, and come down to warm sympathies with you; but then I know well I shall mourn always the vanishing of my mighty gods. It is true, next week I shall have languid moods, when I can well afford to occupy myself with foreign objects; then I shall regret the lost literature of your mind, and wish you were by my side again. But if you come, perhaps you will fill my mind only with new visions, not with yourself but with your lustres, and I shall not be able any more than now to converse with you. So I will owe to my friends this evanescent intercourse. I will receive from them, not what they have, but what they are. They shall give me that which properly they cannot give, but which emanates from them. But they shall not hold me by any relations less subtile and pure. We will meet as though we met not, and part as though we parted not.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因此我对待朋友的态度就如同我对待书本一样。我在哪儿找到它们，就把他们收藏起来，却很少使用它们。我们社交要由自己的思想掌控，哪怕只是一点点的理由也要毫不犹豫地摒弃或是接纳某人。我不能与我的友人进行过多的谈话。他的伟大会让我一起变得伟大，我也就不会屈尊降贵地交谈了。在伟大的时光中，我们的天空会盘旋着种种的预感。我不管是走进去，还是走出来，都只是为了抓住它们。它们现在只是天空里的一片更显明亮的光，我害怕它们消失在空中。我应该为它们奉献出自己。所以就算我的友人在我心中是如何的珍贵，我也不会与他们谈话，研究他们的想象，以防自我也会丧失掉。不要再耗费在对高尚的求索，精神的天文学，或是对星球的探索之上，屈身来为你表示热烈的同情，这让我获得舒心的愉悦；但是，那时，我们会因为天神们的消失永远地伤感下去。必然，下周我会心情不佳，在那时，我会专心于无关的目标；那时我会希望你还在身边，并为你心灵里消失的文学感到懊悔。可是，如果你回来了，在我的心里也只会充满新的想象，没有你真实的自己，只是你的光芒，就像现在一样，我依旧无法与你平等交流。如此，这种短期的交际就要交由我的朋友了。我在那里得到的不会是他们的财富，而是他们本身。我将从他们那得到的东西正是他们不能给的，可是那种东西会自然地由他们身上散发出去。可是，我们互相保持的关系都是一样的纯洁，没有任何的高低之别。我们相见时，好像我们从不认识，我们离别时，好像我们未曾分开。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It has seemed to me lately more possible than I knew, to carry a friendship greatly, on one side, without due correspondence on the other. Why should I cumber myself with regrets that the receiver is not capacious? It never troubles the sun that some of his rays fall wide and vain into ungrateful space, and only a small part on the reflecting planet. Let your greatness educate the crude and cold companion. If he is unequal, he will presently pass away; but thou art enlarged by thy own shining, and, no longer a mate for frogs and worms, dost soar and burn with the gods of the empyrean. It is thought a disgrace to love unrequited. But the great will see that true love cannot be unrequited. True love transcends the unworthy object, and dwells and broods on the eternal, and when the poor interposed mask crumbles, it is not sad, but feels rid of so much earth, and feels its independency the surer. Yet these things may hardly be said without a sort of treachery to the relation. The essence of friendship is entireness, a total magnanimity and trust. It must not surmise or provide for infirmity. It treats its object as a god, that it may deify both.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就如同一方对待友谊很崇高，而另一方却无法融洽和谐一样，可最近这情况好像是能到达的，这让我不曾料到。我们用不着为一方没有度量的接纳去懊恼，那只会让自己不快。太阳不会为那些事而懊恼，那些它的光芒只有一小部分照到了反光的星球上，而大多数耗费在了不知回报的空间里的事情。让你的伟大来对同伴的粗鲁、冷漠施以教诲吧。如果他无法跟上你的步伐，他会自行离开；你被自己散发出的光芒扩大了，不再与蝇营狗苟为伍，而在天国的云端与诸神为伴。没有回报的爱，被人认为是一种耻辱。可是伟大的人将会明白，真正的爱是无法获得回报的，因为它将会超越那不匹配的对象，在永恒里谈论、思考问题。夹在中间的遮掩面具的损毁并不会让它难过，它反而会为了舍弃这份负担而高兴，这让它更加觉得自己的独立是多么的牢靠。可是，这会让人感觉像是背负了一种背叛。友谊是一种没有索取的付出与信任，是不被怀疑的，它的本质就是完整的。它如对待圣灵一样对待自己的伙伴，它的影响下，双方都神圣了起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
