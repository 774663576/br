<div class="line_en">My grandmother had died a month previously after a long illness, and that summer was veiled in a thin layer of sadness; it gently smothered everything we did, muting mine and my sister's tendencies to the dramatic, and cancelling our usual summer routines of brief holidays and days out. My mother stood most days at her washing-up bowl, her back rigid with the effort of trying to suppress her tears, while Dad disappeared to work each morning with a grimly determined expression, returning hours later shiny-faced from the heat and unable to speak before he had cracked open a beer. My sister was home from her first year at university, her head already somewhere far from our small town. I was twenty and would meet Patrick in less than three months. We were enjoying one of those rare summers of utter freedom -- no financial responsibility, no debts, no time owing to anybody. I had a seasonal job and all the hours in the world to practise my make-up, put on heels that made my father wince, and just generally work out who I was.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was almost seven years ago, in the last lazy, heat-slurred days of July, when the narrow streets around the castle were thick with tourists, and the air filled with the sound of their meandering footsteps and the chimes of the ever-present ice cream vans that lined the top of the hill.</div>

<div class="line_en">I dressed normally, in those days. Or, I should say, I dressed like the other girls in town -- long hair, flicked over the shoulder, indigo jeans, T-shirts tight enough to show off our tiny waists and high breasts. We spent hours perfecting our lipgloss, and the exact shade of a smokey eye. We looked good in anything, but spent hours complaining about non-existent cellulite and invisible flaws in our skin.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那些日子我穿衣走寻常路线，或者应该说像镇上的其他女孩一样穿衣打扮：及肩长发、靛蓝牛仔裤、足够炫耀细腰和丰腴胸部的紧身T恤。我们花数小时完善唇彩，化烟熏妆。我们穿什么都好看，却不停抱怨皮肤上不存在的脂肪团和不可见的瑕疵。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And I had ideas. Things I wanted to do. One of the boys I knew at school had taken a round-the-world trip and come back somehow removed and unknowable, like he wasn't the same scuffed eleven-year-old who used to blow spit bubbles during double French. I had booked a cheap flight to Australia on a whim, and was trying to find someone who might come with me. I liked the exoticism his travels gave him, the unknownness. He had blown in with the soft breezes of a wider world, and it was weirdly seductive. Everyone here knew everything about me, after all. And with a sister like mine, I was never allowed to forget any of it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对于要做的事情我自有想法。我在学校认识的一个男孩做了一次环球旅行，回来后不知怎么的变得很不一样，不可捉摸。他好像不再是那个拖着脚走路的十一岁男孩，不再是那个过去在法语课吹泡泡的男孩了。一时心血来潮，我订了一张去澳大利亚的廉价机票，花心思想找个人跟我一起。我喜欢旅行带给那个男孩的那种异国情调，那种陌生。他向我吹来了更广阔的世界的和风，那个世界极其富有魅力。毕竟这里的每个人都知道我的一切，有一个像我的妹妹，使我从不能忘记任何一点。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a Friday, and I had spent the day working as a car park attendant with a group of girls I had known at school, steering visitors to a craft fair held in the grounds of the castle. The whole day was punctuated with laughter, with fizzy drinks guzzled under a hot sun, the sky blue, light glinting off the battlements. I don't think there was a single tourist who didn't smile at me that day. People find it very hard not to smile at a group of cheerful, giggling girls. We were paid £30, and the organizers were so pleased with the turnout that they gave us an extra fiver each. We celebrated by getting drunk with some boys who had been working on the far car park by the visitor centre. They were well spoken, sporting rugby shirts and floppy hair. One was called Ed, two of them were at university -- I still can't remember where -- and they were working for holiday money too. They were flush with cash at the end of a whole week of stewarding, and when our money ran out they were happy to buy drinks for giddy local girls who flicked their hair and sat on each other's laps and shrieked and joked and called them posh. They spoke a different language; they talked of gap years and summers spent in South America, and the backpacker trail in Thailand and who was going to try for an internship abroad. While we listened, and drank, I remember my sister stopping by the beer garden where we lay sprawled on the grass. She was wearing the world's oldest hoody and no make-up, and I'd forgotten I was meant to be meeting her. I told her to tell Mum and Dad I'd be back sometime after I was thirty. For some reason I found this hysterically funny. She had lifted her eyebrows, and stalked off like I was the most irritating person ever born.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那是星期五，我和在学校认识的一群女孩在停车场当了一天的工作人员，引导游客到城堡运动场举办的一个工艺品展场参观。整整一天笑声不断，在毒日头下面，我们狂饮汽水。天很蓝，城垛那边的光一闪一闪。我觉得那天没有一个游客没对我笑。对着一群活力四射、老是咯咯笑的女孩，人们很难不微笑。我们每人拿到了30英镑的报酬，到场人数很让组织者满意，所以他们又额外给了我们每人五英镑。为了庆祝，我们和一群远在游客中心停车场工作的男孩喝得烂醉。他们说话得体，穿着橄榄球衣，头发松垂。有一个叫埃德，有两个是大学生——我仍然不记得是哪个学校的——他们也在为度假挣钱。做了一整个星期的服务生，他们挣得盆满钵满的。我们的钱花光后，他们很乐意为头晕眼花的当地女孩再买点喝的，她们轻拂他们的头发，坐在他们的大腿上，又叫又笑，称赞他们时髦。他们说着一种不同的语言，谈论着前年在南美度过的夏天，在泰国的背包客之旅，以及有人要去国外实习的事情。我们听着，喝着。我记得后来，我妹妹来到了露天啤酒店，那时我和大家正手脚摊开仰卧在草地上。她穿着世界上最老土的连帽运动衫，没有化妆。我忘记了要跟她会面，我让她告诉父母我三十岁过后才会回去。不晓得为什么，我觉得这个想法极其好玩。她扬了扬眉，怒气冲冲地走了，好像我是世上最让人不快的人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When the Red Lion closed we all went and sat in the centre of the castle maze. Someone managed to scramble over the gates and, after much colliding and giggling, we all found our way to the middle and drank strong cider while someone passed around a joint. I remember staring up at the stars, feeling myself disappear into their infinite depths, as the ground gently swayed and lurched around me like the deck of a huge ship. Someone was playing a guitar, and I had a pair of pink satin high heels on which I kicked into the long grass and never went back for. I thought I probably ruled the universe.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“红狮”打烊时，我们到城堡迷宫的中心坐了下来。有人爬上了门，一阵撞击和傻笑后，我们都到了中间，喝起烈性苹果酒，有人分发大麻烟卷。我记得我仰视过星星，感觉自己好像消失在了那无限的纵深中。地面轻轻摇摆，在我身边晃荡，就像一艘巨大轮船的甲板。有人在弹奏吉他，我把自己那双粉红缎面的高跟鞋甩进了深草丛中，没有去找。我觉得整个宇宙都听命于我。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I looked into the rear-view mirror. Will was smiling.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I especially didn't enjoy that bit near the end, the bit where the violin was singing by itself."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我尤其不喜欢快结束时的那段，那段小提琴独奏。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We pulled up outside the annexe. In front of us, just visible above the wall, the castle sat, floodlit under the full moon, gazing serenely down from its position on the top of the hill.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们在配楼外停下。我们面前，刚好能看见城墙内的城堡笼罩在一轮满月中，月光宁静地从山顶倾泻下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"So you're not a classical music person."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这么说你不喜欢古典音乐。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We sat in silence, gazing at the castle. Normally, at night, it was bathed in a kind of orange glow from the lights dotted around the fortress wall. But tonight, under a full moon, it seemed flooded in an ethereal blue.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们在静默中坐着，注视城堡。通常晚上点缀在城墙上的灯，会让城堡沐浴在一片橙色的光芒中。但是今晚，满月之下，城堡似乎沉浸在天蓝色中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I grinned back at him. "I really loved it," I said. "I'm not sure I'd like all classical music, but I thought that was amazing." I rubbed my nose. "Thank you. Thank you for taking me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我露齿而笑。“我真的非常喜欢，”我说，“我不确定我会喜欢所有的古典音乐，但是我觉得古典音乐让人惊叹。”我擦了擦鼻子。“谢谢你，谢谢你带我去。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我一点儿也不喜欢。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What kind of music would they have played there, do you think?" I said. "They must have listened to something."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你觉得他们在那儿演奏些什么样的音乐？”我问，“他们肯定得听点什么。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I could tell."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“看得出来。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I could see you didn't like that bit. In fact, I think you had tears in your eyes you hated it so much."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Nah. I don't really go to the castle."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不用了。我不怎么去城堡。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">My answer was non-committal. We sat there a moment longer, listening to the engine tick its way to silence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我的回答含糊其辞。我们在那儿坐了一会儿，听着引擎转动的声音渐渐停止。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Just hold on. Just for a minute."</div>

<div class="line_en">Even in the half-dark it seemed effortful.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="即便是在半明半暗中，看起来这也很费劲。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The castle? Medieval stuff. Lutes, strings. Not my cup of tea, but I've got some I can lend you, if you like. You should walk around the castle with it on earphones, if you really wanted the full experience."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“城堡？中世纪的东西吧。诗琴[39]，弦乐。不是我喜欢的，不过我有一些这类音乐碟，要是你喜欢可以借给你。你可以戴上耳机听这些音乐，绕着城堡走走，如果你真的想要身临其境的话。” 注：[39]14～17世纪使用较多的一种形似吉他的半梨形拨弦乐器。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Right," I said, unfastening my belt. "We'd better get you in. The evening routine awaits."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你还好吧？”我看向他的轮椅，担心他是不是有地方被夹住了，担心我又做错了事情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I could see his pale collar, his dark suit jacket a contrast against it.</div>

<div class="line_en">My sister and I never really talked about what happened that night at the maze. I'm not entirely sure we had the words. She held me for a bit, then spent some time helping me find my clothes, and then searched in vain in the long grass for my shoes until I told her that it really didn't matter. I wouldn't have worn them again, anyway. And then we walked home slowly -- me in my bare feet, her with her arm linked through mine, even though we hadn't walked like that since she was in her first year at school and Mum had insisted I never let her go.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我妹妹和我从没真正谈论过那晚在迷宫发生的事情，我不确信我们拌过嘴。她抱住了我一会儿，接着花了些时间帮我找衣服，还在深草中徒劳地寻找我的鞋，直到我告诉她真的没有关系。无论如何，我不会再穿它们了。然后我们慢慢地走回家——我光着脚，她揽着我的胳膊，自从她上小学一年级，我们就从未这样一起走过。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Sure."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I just… want to be a man who has been to a concert with a girl in a red dress. Just for a few minutes more."</div>

<div class="line_en">I closed my eyes and lay my head against the headrest, and we sat there together for a while longer, two people lost in remembered music, half hidden in the shadow of a castle on a moonlit hill.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我闭上双眼，头枕在头靠上。我们又坐了一会儿，两个迷失在音乐中的人，半隐在月光下城堡的阴影中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I released the door handle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我放开门把手。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dad was still up, watching some football match. "You girls are a bit late," he called out. "I know it's a Friday, but still…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="父亲还没有睡觉，在看足球比赛。“姑娘们，你们好晚，”他喊道，“我知道今天是星期五，但是……”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I chopped all my hair off the following week. I cancelled my plane ticket. I didn't go out with the girls from my old school again. Mum was too sunk in her own grief to notice, and Dad put any change in mood in our house, and my new habit of locking myself in my bedroom, down to "women's problems". I had worked out who I was, and it was someone very different from the giggling girl who got drunk with strangers. It was someone who wore nothing that could be construed as suggestive. Clothes that would not appeal to the kind of men who went to the Red Lion, anyway.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二周我把头发剪了，取消了航班。我不再跟以前学校的女孩出去了。母亲沉浸在自己的悲伤中，没有注意我，父亲把这所屋子里的情绪变化和我把自己锁在卧室的新习惯归结为“女人们的问题”。我知道了自己是什么样的人，我绝不是那种跟陌生人喝醉酒傻笑的女孩。我是那种无论穿什么都被认为不可取的人。总之，吸引不了去“红狮”的男人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Back then, I had the room that is now Granddad's I walked swiftly upstairs and, before my sister could say a word, I closed the door behind me.</div>
