<div class="line_en">After another week of rain the high arch of blue sky appeared again and the sun which poured down was quite hot. Though there had been no chance to see either the secret garden or Dickon, Mistress Mary had enjoyed herself very much. The week had not seemed long. She had spent hours of every day with Colin in his room, talking about Rajahs or gardens or Dickon and the cottage on the moor. They had looked at the splendid books and pictures and sometimes Mary had read things to Colin, and sometimes he had read a little to her. When he was amused and interested she thought he scarcely looked like an invalid at all, except that his face was so colorless and he was always on the sofa.</div>

<div class="line_en">"You are a sly young one to listen and get out of your bed to go following things up like you did that night," Mrs. Medlock said once. "But there's no saying it's not been a sort of blessing to the lot of us. He's not had a tantrum or a whining fit since you made friends. The nurse was just going to give up the case because she was so sick of him, but she says she doesn't mind staying now you've gone on duty with her," laughing a little.</div>

<div class="line_en">In her talks with Colin, Mary had tried to be very cautious about the secret garden. There were certain things she wanted to find out from him, but she felt that she must find them out without asking him direct questions. In the first place, as she began to like to be with him, she wanted to discover whether he was the kind of boy you could tell a secret to. He was not in the least like Dickon, but he was evidently so pleased with the idea of a garden no one knew anything about that she thought perhaps he could be trusted. But she had not known him long enough to be sure. The second thing she wanted to find out was this: If he could be trusted-if he really could-wouldn't it be possible to take him to the garden without having any one find it out? The grand doctor had said that he must have fresh air and Colin had said that he would not mind fresh air in a secret garden. Perhaps if he had a great deal of fresh air and knew Dickon and the robin and saw things growing he might not think so much about dying. Mary had seen herself in the glass sometimes lately when she had realized that she looked quite a different creature from the child she had seen when she arrived from India. This child looked nicer. Even Martha had seen a change in her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛丽和柯林聊天时，对秘密花园非常谨慎。有些事情她想从他那里探知，但是她觉得一定不能直接问他。首先，随着她开始喜欢和他在一起，她想看他是不是那种你可以告诉他秘密的男生。他一点不像迪肯，但是一个无人知晓的花园这个主意显然很取悦于他，她想也许可以信任他。可是她认识他还不够长，不足以肯定。她想探知的第二件事是这个：要是他可以信任——要是他真的可以——不是有可能不让任何人发现，把他带到秘密花园里吗？那个大医生说过他一定要呼吸新鲜空气，而柯林说过他不会介意秘密花园里的新鲜空气。要是他呼吸很多新鲜空气，认识迪肯和知更鸟，看到东西生长，也许他就不会老想着死了。最近，玛丽有时在镜中看自己，已经意识到，她和刚从印度来的那个孩子看起来大不一样了。这个孩子显得好看些。甚至玛莎都看出她的变化来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">On that first morning when the sky was blue again Mary wakened very early. The sun was pouring in slanting rays through the blinds and there was something so joyous in the sight of it that she jumped out of bed and ran to the window. She drew up the blinds and opened the window itself and a great waft of fresh, scented air blew in upon her. The moor was blue and the whole world looked as if something Magic had happened to it. There were tender little fluting sounds here and there and everywhere, as if scores of birds were beginning to tune up for a concert. Mary put her hand out of the window and held it in the sun.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="天空再次变蓝的第一个早晨，玛丽醒得很早。太阳穿透遮幕泼进来，光束斜射，这一幕里有一种欢欣的东西，她蹦下床，跑到窗边。她拉起遮幕，打开窗户，一大股新鲜、含香的空气吹到她身上。牧尔蓝蓝的，整个世界仿佛发生了什么魔法。有娇嫩的小小声音如同吹笛，这处，那处，到处，仿佛许许多多小鸟来出席一个音乐会。玛丽把手伸出窗户，保持在阳光里。">查看中文翻译</div>

She unchained and unbolted and unlocked and when the door was open she sprang across the step with one bound, and there she was standing on the grass, which seemed to have turned green, and with the sun pouring down on her and warm sweet wafts about her and the fluting and twittering and singing coming from every bush and tree. She clasped her hands for pure joy and looked up in the sky and it was so blue and pink and pearly and white and flooded with springtime light that she felt as if she must flute and sing aloud herself and knew that thrushes and robins and skylarks could not possibly help it. She ran around the shrubs and paths towards the secret garden.</div>

<div class="line_en">When she had reached the place where the door hid itself under the ivy, she was startled by a curious loud sound. It was the caw-caw of a crow and it came from the top of the wall, and when she looked up, there sat a big glossy-plumaged blue-black bird, looking down at her very wisely indeed. She had never seen a crow so close before and he made her a little nervous, but the next moment he spread his wings and flapped away across the garden. She hoped he was not going to stay inside and she pushed the door open wondering if he would. When she got fairly into the garden she saw that he probably did intend to stay because he had alighted on a dwarf apple-tree and under the apple-tree was lying a little reddish animal with a bushy tail, and both of them were watching the stooping body and rust-red head of Dickon, who was kneeling on the grass working hard.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当她到了藏在常春藤下的门那里，她被一道奇怪响亮的声音吓了一跳。是呱——呱的乌鸦叫，来自墙头，她抬头看，一只羽毛光滑的蓝黑色大鸟站在那儿，着实睿智地俯瞰着她。她从没这么近地看到一只乌鸦，它让她有点紧张，不过下一刻就展开翅膀，拍着穿过花园飞走了。她希望它不会留在花园里，她推开门猜测它会不会。等她进到花园深处，她看出它多半准备留下来，因为它已经停到一棵矮种苹果树上，苹果树下躺着一只微红的动物，尾巴蓬松，它们两个都在注视着迪肯锈红色的头和俯下的身体。他跪在草地上卖力地干着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The long warm rain had done strange things to the herbaceous beds which bordered the walk by the lower wall. There were things sprouting and pushing out from the roots of clumps of plants and there were actually here and there glimpses of royal purple and yellow unfurling among the stems of crocuses. Six months before Mistress Mary would not have seen how the world was waking up, but now she missed nothing.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mistress Mary was not at all sure that she knew, as Dickon seemed to, how to try to look like grass and trees and bushes. But he had said the queer thing as if it were the simplest and most natural thing in the world, and she felt it must be quite easy to him, and indeed she watched him for a few minutes carefully, wondering if it was possible for him to quietly turn green and put out branches and leaves. But he only sat wonderfully still, and when he spoke dropped his voice to such a softness that it was curious that she could hear him, but she could.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Us mustn't seem as if us was watchin' him too close," said Dickon. "He'd be out with us for good if he got th' notion us was interferin' now.
