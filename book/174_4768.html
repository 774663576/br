<div class="line_en">All children, except one, grow up. They soon know that they will grow up, and the way Wendy knew was this. One day when she was two years old she was playing in a garden, and she plucked another flower and ran with it to her mother. I suppose she must have looked rather delightful, for Mrs. Darling put her hand to her heart and cried, "Oh, why can't you remain like this for ever!" This was all that passed between them on the subject, but henceforth Wendy knew that she must grow up. You always know after you are two. Two is the beginning of the end.</div>

<div class="line_en">Of course they lived at 14 (their house number on their street), and until Wendy came her mother was the chief one. She was a lovely lady, with a romantic mind and such a sweet mocking mouth. Her romantic mind was like the tiny boxes, one within the other, that come from the puzzling East, however many you discover there is always one more; and her sweet mocking mouth had one kiss on it that Wendy could never get, though there is was, perfectly conspicuous in the right-hand corner.</div>

<div class="line_en">The way Mr. Darling won her was this: the many gentlemen who had been boys when she was a girl discovered simultaneously that they loved her, and they all ran to her house to propose to her except Mr. Darling, who took a cab and nipped in first, and so he got her. He got all of her, except the innermost box and the kiss. He never knew about the box, and in time he gave up trying for the kiss. Wendy thought Napoleon could have got it, but I can picture him trying, and then going off in a passion, slamming the door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="达林先生是这样赢得他太太的：她还是个女孩的时候，周围有好些男孩，他们长成大人以后，忽然一齐发现他们爱上了她，于是他们都跑着拥进她家向她求婚；只有达林先生的做法不同，他雇了一辆马车，抢在他们头里来到她家里，于是就赢得了她。达林先生得到了她的一切，只是没有得到她那些小盒子最里面的一只和那个吻。那只小盒子他从来也不知道，那个吻他渐渐地也不再想去求得了。温迪心想，兴许拿破仑能得到那个吻，不过据我估摸，拿破仑必定试图求吻来着，可是过后却怒气冲冲地甩门而去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mr. Darling used to boast to Wendy that her mother not only loved him but respected him. He was one of those deep ones who know about stocks and shares. Of course no one really knows, but he quite seemed to know, and he often said stocks were up and shares were down in a way that would have made any woman respect him.</div>

She drew them when she should have been totting up. They were Mrs. Darling's guesses.</div>

Mr. Darling was frightfully proud of her, but he was very honourable, and he sat on the edge of Mrs. Darling's bed, holding her hand and calculating expenses, while she looked at him imploringly.

<div class="line_en">There was the same excitement over John, and Michael had even a narrower squeak; but both were kept, and soon, you might have seen the three of them going in a row to Miss Fulsom's Kindergarten school, accompanied by their nurse.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mrs. Darling loved to have everything just so, and Mr. Darling had a passion for being exactly like his neighbours; so, of course, they had a nurse. As they were poor, owing to the amount of milk the children drank, this nurse was a prim Newfoundland dog, called Nana, who had belonged to no one in particular until the Darlings engaged her. She had always thought children important, however, and the Darlings had become acquainted with her in Kensington Gardens, where she spent most of her spare time peeping into perambulators, and was much hated by careless nursemaids, whom she followed to their homes and complained of to their mistresses. She proved to be quite a treasure of a nurse. How thorough she was at bath-time, and up at any moment of the night if one of her charges made the slightest cry. Of course her kennel was in the nursery. She had a genius for knowing when a cough is a thing to have no patience with and when it needs stocking around your throat. She believed to her last day in old-fashioned remedies like rhubarb leaf, and made sounds of contempt over all this new-fangled talk about germs, and so on. It was a lesson in propriety to see her escorting the children to school, walking sedately by their side when they were well behaved, and butting them back into line if they strayed. On John's footer (in England soccer was called football, "footer for short) days she never once forgot his sweater, and she usually carried an umbrella in her mouth in case of rain. There is a room in the basement of Miss Fulsom's school where the nurses wait. They sat on forms, while Nana lay on the floor, but that was the only difference. They affected to ignore her as of an inferior social status to themselves, and she despised their light talk. She resented visits to the nursery from Mrs. Darling's friends, but if they did come she first whipped off Michael's pinafore and put him into the one with blue braiding, and smoothed out Wendy and made a dash at John's hair.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="达林太大是安于现状的，达林先生却喜欢事事都向左邻右舍看齐；所以，当然他们也得请一位保姆。由于孩子们喝的牛奶太多，他们很穷，所以，他们家的保姆只是一只严肃庄重的纽芬兰大狗，名叫娜娜。在达林夫妇雇用她以前，这狗本没有固定的主人，不过她总是把孩子看得很重的。达林一家是在肯辛顿公园里和她结识的。她闲来无事去那儿游逛，把头伸进摇篮车窥望，那些粗心大意的保姆总是讨厌她；因为她老是跟着她们回家，向她们的主人告状。她果然成了一位不可多得的好保姆。给孩子洗澡时，她是多么认真一丝不苟啊。夜里不管什么时候，她看管的孩子只要有一个轻轻地哭一声，她就一跃而起。狗舍当然是设在育儿室里。她天生有一种聪明，知道什么样的咳嗽是不可怠慢的，什么时候该用一只袜子围着脖子。她从来都相信老式的治疗方法，比如用大黄叶；听到那些什么细菌之类的新名词，她总是用鼻子不屑地哼一声。你若是看到她护送孩子上学时那种合乎礼仪的情景，真会大长见识。当孩子们规规矩矩时，她就安详地走在他们身边；要是他们乱跑乱动，她就把他们推进行列。在约翰踢足球的日子，她从不忘带着他的线衣；天要下雨的时候，她总是把伞衔在嘴里。福尔萨姆的幼儿园里，有一间地下室，保姆们就等候在那里。她们坐在长凳上，而娜娜是伏卧在地板上，不过这是唯一的不同之处。她们认为她社会地位比她们低贱，装作没把她放在眼里的样子；其实，娜娜才瞧不起她们那种无聊的闲聊呢。她很不高兴达林太太的朋友们来育儿室看望，可要是她们真的来了，她就先扯下迈克尔的围裙，给他换上那件带蓝穗子的，把温迪的衣裙抚平，匆匆梳理一下约翰的头发。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Nana also troubled him in another way. He had sometimes a feeling that she did not admire him. "I know she admires you tremendously, George," Mrs. Darling would assure him, and then she would sign to the children to be specially nice to father. Lovely dances followed, in which the only other servant, Liza, was sometimes allowed to join. Such a midget she looked in her long skirt and maid's cap, though she had sworn, when engaged, that she would never see ten again. The gaiety of those romps! And gayest of all was Mrs. Darling, who would pirouette so wildly that all you could see of her was the kiss, and then if you had dashed at her you might have got it. There never was a simpler happier family until the coming of Peter Pan.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="娜娜还在另一个方面使达林先生不安，他有时觉得娜娜不大佩服他。“我知道，她可佩服你啦，乔治。”达林太太向他担保说，然后就示意孩子们要特别敬重父亲。接着，就跳起了欢快的舞。他们唯一的另一位女仆莉莎，有时也被允许参加跳舞。莉莎穿着长裙，戴着女佣人的布帽，显得那么矮小，虽说开始雇用的时候，她一口咬定她早就过十岁了。小家伙们多快活呀！最快活的是达林太太，她踮起脚尖发狂般地飞旋，你能看到的只是她的那个吻。这时要是你扑了过去，定能得到那一吻。再也没有比他们更单纯、更快乐的家庭了，直到彼得·潘来临。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mrs. Darling first heard of Peter when she was tidying up her children's minds. It is the nightly custom of every good mother after her children are asleep to rummage in their minds and put things straight for next morning, repacking into their proper places the many articles that have wandered during the day. If you could keep awake (but of course you can't) you would see your own mother doing this, and you would find it very interesting to watch her. It is quite like tidying up drawers. You would see her on her knees, I expect, lingering humorously over some of your contents, wondering where on earth you had picked this thing up, making discoveries sweet and not so sweet, pressing this to her cheek as if it were as nice as a kitten, and hurriedly stowing that out of sight. When you wake in the morning, the naughtiness and evil passions with which you went to bed have been folded up small and placed at the bottom of your mind and on the top, beautifully aired, are spread out your prettier thoughts, ready for you to put on.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="达林太太第一次知道彼得，是在她清理孩子们的心思的时候。凡是好妈妈，晚上都有一个习惯，就是在孩子们睡着以后，搜检他们的心思，使白天弄乱了的什物各就各位，为明天早晨把一切料理停当。假如你能醒着（不过你当然不能），你就能看见你妈妈做这些事；你会发觉，留心地观看她是很有趣的。那就和整理抽屉差不多。我估摸，你会看见她跪在那儿，很有兴味地察看里面的东西，纳闷这样东西不知你是打哪儿拣到的；发现有些是可爱的，有些是不那么可爱的。把一件东西贴在她脸上，像捧着一只逗人的小猫；把另一件东西赶快收藏起来，不让人看见。你清早醒来时，临睡时揣着的那些顽皮念头和坏脾气都给叠得小小的，压在你心思的底层。而在上面，平平整整摆着你的那些美好念头，等你去穿戴打扮起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I don't know whether you have ever seen a map of a person's mind. Doctors sometimes draw maps of other parts of you, and your own map can become intensely interesting, but catch them trying to draw a map of a child's mind, which is not only confused, but keeps going round all the time. There are zigzag lines on it, just like your temperature on a card, and these are probably roads in the island, for the Neverland is always more or less an island, with astonishing splashes of colour here and there, and coral reefs and rakish-looking craft in the offing, and savages and lonely lairs, and gnomes who are mostly tailors, and caves through which a river runs, and princes with six elder brothers, and a hut fast going to decay, and one very small old lady with a hooked nose. It would be an easy map if that were all, but there is also first day at school, religion, fathers, the round pond, needle-work, murders, hangings, verbs that take the dative, chocolate pudding day, getting into braces, say ninety-nine, three-pence for pulling out your tooth yourself, and so on, and either these are part of the island or they are another map showing through, and it is all rather confusing, especially as nothing will stand still.</div>

<div class="line_en">Of course the Neverlands vary a good deal. John's, for instance, had a lagoon with flamingoes flying over it at which John was shooting, while Michael, who was very small, had a flamingo with lagoons flying over it. John lived in a boat turned upside down on the sands, Michael in a wigwam, Wendy in a house of leaves deftly sewn together. John had no friends, Michael had friends at night, Wendy had a pet wolf forsaken by its parents, but on the whole the Neverlands have a family resemblance, and if they stood still in a row you could say of them that they have each other's nose, and so forth. On these magic shores children at play are for ever beaching their coracles (simple boat). We too have been there; we can still hear the sound of the surf, though we shall land no more.</div>

She knew of no Peter, and yet he was here and there in John and Michael's minds, while Wendy's began to be scrawled all over with him.

<div class="line_en">Children have the strangest adventures without being troubled by them. For instance, they may remember to mention, a week after the event happened, that when they were in the wood they had met their dead father and had a game with him. It was in this casual way that Wendy one morning made a disquieting revelation. Some leaves of a tree had been found on the nursery floor, which certainly were not there when the children went to bed, and Mrs. Darling was puzzling over them when Wendy said with a tolerant smile:</div>

<div class="line_en">But, on the other hand, there were the leaves. Mrs. Darling examined them very carefully; they were skeleton leaves, but she was sure they did not come from any tree that grew in England. She crawled about the floor, peering at it with a candle for marks of a strange foot. She rattled the poker up the chimney and tapped the walls. She let down a tape from the window to the pavement, and it was a sheer drop of thirty feet, without so much as a spout to climb up by.</div>

<div class="line_en">While she slept she had a dream. She dreamt that the Neverland had come too near and that a strange boy had broken through from it. He did not alarm her, for she thought she had seen him before in the faces of many women who have no children. Perhaps he is to be found in the faces of some mothers also. But in her dream he had rent the film that obscures the Neverland, and she saw Wendy and John and Michael peeping through the gap.</div>

<div class="line_en">She started up with a cry, and saw the boy, and somehow she knew at once that he was Peter Pan. If you or I or Wendy had been there we should have seen that he was very like Mrs. Darling's kiss. He was a lovely boy, clad in skeleton leaves and the juices that ooze out of trees but the most entrancing thing about him was that he had all his first teeth. When he saw she was a grown-up, he gnashed the little pearls at her.</div>
