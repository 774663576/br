<div class="line_cn" title="“食品室里还有点面包，”厨子说。“一天到这时候，你只能得到这些了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sara went and found the bread. It was old and hard and dry. The cook was in too vicious a humor to give her anything to eat with it. It was always safe and easy to vent her spite on Sara. Really, it was hard for the child to climb the three long flights of stairs leading to her attic. She often found them long and steep when she was tired; but tonight it seemed as if she would never reach the top. Several times she was obliged to stop to rest. When she reached the top landing she was glad to see the glimmer of a light coming from under her door. That meant that Ermengarde had managed to creep up to pay her a visit. There was some comfort in that. It was better than to go into the room alone and find it empty and desolate. The mere presence of plump, comfortable Ermengarde, wrapped in her red shawl, would warm it a little.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="萨拉去找到了那块面包。那是块又硬又干的宿面包。厨子的脾气那么恶劣，是不会再给她别的什么东西吃的。向萨拉泄愤总是既安全又容易的。对这孩子来说，要爬三长段楼梯登上阁楼实在是桩难事。她疲劳时总觉得那些梯级又多又陡，但今晚似乎永远也爬不到顶了。有好几次她不得不停下来休息。她到达顶层楼梯口的平台时，高兴地看到她的门下露出一线微光。这意味着埃芒加德已设法溜上来看望她了。这带来些许安慰，比孤单单进人这空荡凄凉的房间要好得多。单是那令人宽慰的裹着红披肩的胖胖的埃芒加德的出现，就能使房间温暖一些。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Yes; there Ermengarde was when she opened the door. She was sitting in the middle of the bed, with her feet tucked safely under her. She had never become intimate with Melchisedec and his family, though they rather fascinated her. When she found herself alone in the attic she always preferred to sit on the bed until Sara arrived. She had, in fact, on this occasion had time to become rather nervous, because Melchisedec had appeared and sniffed about a good deal, and once had made her utter a repressed squeal by sitting up on his hind legs and, while he looked at her, sniffing pointedly in her direction.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="果然，她打开门一看，埃芒加德正在那儿。她坐在床中央，双脚稳稳地蜷缩在身下。她从来没有和梅基塞代克以及它的一家搞得热乎起来，虽然它们很使她人迷。当她发现阁楼里只有自己一人时，她总是宁愿坐在床上直到萨拉回来。实际上这次时间一长，她变得有点儿紧张不安，因为梅基塞代克频频出现，到处乱嗅，有一次后腿着地，坐直了身子，一边望着她，一边冲她这个方向连连嗅着，使她小声尖叫起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, Sara," she cried out, "I am glad you have come. Melchy WOULD sniff about so. I tried to coax him to go back, but he wouldn't for such a long time. I like him, you know; but it does frighten me when he sniffs right at me. Do you think he ever WOULD jump?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“啊，萨拉，”她喊道，“你来了我真高兴，梅基（梅基塞代克的爱称）老是这样嗅来嗅去。我努力哄它回去，可这么长时间它就是不肯回去。我喜欢它，这你知道，可当它直接冲着我嗅时，实在使我害怕。你想它会跳起来吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The truth was that Ermengarde did not know anything of the sometimes almost unbearable side of life in the attic and she had not a sufficiently vivid imagination to depict it for herself. On the rare occasions that she could reach Sara's room she only saw the side of it which was made exciting by things which were "pretended" and stories which were told. Her visits partook of the character of adventures; and though sometimes Sara looked rather pale, and it was not to be denied that she had grown very thin, her proud little spirit would not admit of complaints. She had never confessed that at times she was almost ravenous with hunger, as she was tonight. She was growing rapidly, and her constant walking and running about would have given her a keen appetite even if she had had abundant and regular meals of a much more nourishing nature than the unappetizing, inferior food snatched at such odd times as suited the kitchen convenience. She was growing used to a certain gnawing feeling in her young stomach.</div>

When she comes into the attic I can't spread feasts, but I can tell stories, and not let her know disagreeable things. I dare say poor chatelaines had to do that in time of famine, when their lands had been pillaged." She was a proud, brave little chatelaine, and dispensed generously the one hospitality she could offer -- the dreams she dreamed -- the visions she saw -- the imaginings which were her joy and comfort.</div>
