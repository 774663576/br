<div class="line_en">Ron and Herinione watched Harry nervously all through dintier, not daring to talk about what they'd overheard, because Percy was sitting close by them. When they went upstairs to the crowded common room, it was to find Fred and George had set off half a dozen Dungbombs in a fit of end -- of-term high spirits. Harry, who didn't want Fred and George asking him whether he'd reached Hogsmeade or not, sneaked quietly up to the empty dormitory and headed straight for his bedside cabinet. He pushed his books aside and quickly found what he was looking for -- the leather-bound photo album Hagrid had given him two years ago, which was full of wizard pictures of his mother and father. He sat down on his bed, drew the hangings around him, and started turning the pages, searching, until…</div>

<div class="line_en">Though Professor McGonagall was Head of Gryffindor House, Harry had only seen her in the common room once before, and that had been to make a very grave announcement. He and Ron stared at her, both holding the Firebolt. Hermione walked around them, sat down, picked up the nearest book and hid her face behind it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="麦格教授虽然是格兰芬多学院的院长，哈利却只看到过她来到公共休息室一次，而且那次是为了宣布一件很重要的事情。他和罗恩瞪眼看着她，两人都握着那火弩箭。赫敏在他们身旁走了一圈，坐下来，顺手拿起一本书，把脸藏在书后面。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"So that's it, is it?" said Professor McGonagall beadily, walking over to the fireside and staring at the Firebolt. "Miss Granger has just informed me that you have been sent a broomstick, Potter."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那就是它了，对不对？”麦格教授说着，眼睛发亮。她走到壁炉旁边，看着那火弩箭。“格兰杰小姐刚才告诉我说有人送了你一把飞天扫帚，波特。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry and Ron looked around at Hermione. They could see her forehead reddening over the top of her book, which was upside-down.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利和罗恩回过头来看赫敏。他们看到露在书上面的她的额头红了起来，而且书拿倒了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"May I?" said Professor McGonagall, but she didn't wait for an answer before pulling the Firebolt out of their hands. She examined it carefully from handle to twig-ends. "Hmm. And there was no note at all, Potter? No card? No message of any kind?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“给我看看行吗？”麦格教授说。但她不等回答就把火弩箭从他们手里拿了过去。她从头到尾仔细地检查了一番。“哼，根本没有说明，是不是，波特？没有卡片？没有任何信息？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No," said Harry blankly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没有。”哈利面无表情地说道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"W -- what?" said Harry, scrambling to his feet. "Why?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“什——什么？”哈利说，慌慌张张地站了起来。“为什么？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I see…" said Professor McGonagall. "Well, I'm afraid I will have to take this, Potter."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我明白了——”麦格教授说，“唔，恐怕我不得不把它拿走，波特。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It shouldn't take more than a few weeks," said Professor McGonagall. "You will have it back if we are sure it is jinx-free."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这要不了几个星期。”麦格教授说，“如果我们能肯定它没有附带任何不吉祥的东西，就可以还给你。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Strip it down?" repeated Ron, as though Professor McGonagall was mad.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“拆卸？”罗恩重复了一遍。似乎认为麦格教授疯了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It will need to be checked for jinxes," said Professor McGonagall. "Of course, I'm no expert, but I daresay Madam Hooch and Professor Flitwick will strip it down --"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“必须检查一下看有没有不吉祥的东西。”麦格教授说，“当然，我不是专家，但是我敢说霍琦夫人和弗立维教授会把它拆卸了…”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"There's nothing wrong with it!" said Harry, his voice shaking slightly. "Honestly, Professor --"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“它可没有什么毛病！”哈利说，声音稍有些发抖。“说实在的，麦格教授…”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You can't know that, Potter," said Professor McGonagall, quite kindly, "not until you've flown it, at any rate, and I'm afraid that is out of the question until we are certain that it has not been tampered with. I shall keep you informed."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你不会知道的，波特，”麦格教授很仁慈地说，“无论如何，要等你飞了以后才知道。我想，在我们肯定了解没有人对它做过手脚以前，根本不可能让你骑它去飞的。有什么情况我会随时通知你的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Professor McGonagall turned on her heel and carried the Firebolt out of the portrait hole, which closed behind her. Harry stood staring after her, the tin of High-Finish Polish still clutched in his hands. Ron, however, rounded on Hermione. "What did you go running to McGonagall for?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="麦格教授转身带着火弩箭走出了肖像画的洞，洞在她身后闭上了。哈利目送她离去，手里仍旧抓着那罐高精度上光剂。然而，罗恩转而对着赫敏说话了——“你跑去找麦格教授干吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Hermione threw her book aside. She was still pink in the face, but stood up and faced Ron defiantly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="赫敏把书扔在一边。她的脸仍然是粉红色的，但她不管不顾地站起来面对着罗恩。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Because I thought -- and Professor McGonagall agrees with me -- that that broom was probably sent to Harry by Sirius Black!"</div>
