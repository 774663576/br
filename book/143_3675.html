<div class="line_en">He waved goodbye to the men on the little fishing boat who had brought him to this dock, men who had guarded him these past years. The fishing boat rode the white wake of the ocean liner, a brave little duckling after its mother. The men on it waved back; he would see them no more.</div>

<div class="line_en">The dock itself was alive with scurrying laborers in caps and baggy clothes unloading other ships, loading trucks that had come to the long dock. They were small wiry men who looked more Arabic than Italian, wearing billed caps that obscured their faces. Amongst them would be new bodyguards making sure he came to no harm before he met with Don Croce Malo, Capo di Capi of the "Friends of the Friends," as they were called here in Sicily. Newspapers and the outside world called them the Mafia, but in Sicily the word Mafia never passed the lips of the ordinary citizen. As they would never call Don Croce Malo the Capo di Capi but only "The Good Soul."</div>

<div class="line_en">In his two years of exile in Sicily, Michael had heard many tales about Don Croce, some so fantastic that he almost did not believe in the existence of such a man. But the instructions relayed from his father were explicit: he was ordered to have lunch with Don Croce this very day. And the two of them were to arrange for the escape from Sicily of the country's greatest bandit, Salvatore Guiliano. Michael Corleone could not leave Sicily without Guiliano.</div>

<div class="line_en">Down at the end of the pier, no more than fifty yards away, a huge dark car was parked in the narrow street. Standing before it were three men, dark rectangles cut out of the glaring sheet of light that fell like a wall of gold from the sun. Michael walked toward them. He paused for a moment to light a cigarette and survey the city.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="码头的另一端，离他顶多五十码的一条窄路上，停着一辆黑色大轿车。站在车前的三个人，在耀眼的光线中，就像是金色的幕墙上切出的三个黑色长条。迈克尔朝他们走去，接着停下来点燃一支香烟，审视着这座城市。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Palermo rested in the bottom of a bowl created by an extinct volcano, overwhelmed by mountains on three sides, and escaping into the dazzling blue of the Mediterranean Sea on the fourth side. The city shimmered in the golden rays of the Sicilian noontime sun. Veins of red light struck the earth, as if reflecting the blood shed on the soil of Sicily for countless centuries. The gold rays bathed stately marble columns of Greek temples, spidery Moslem turrets, the fiercely intricate facades of Spanish cathedrals; on a far hillside frowned the battlements of an ancient Norman castle. All left by diverse and cruel armies that had ruled Sicily since before Christ was born. Beyond the castle walls, cone-shaped mountains held the slightly effeminate city of Palermo in a strangler's embrace, as if both were sinking gracefully to their knees, a cord pulling tightly around the city's neck. Far above, countless tiny red hawks darted across the brilliant blue sky.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="巴勒莫位于一座死火山形成的碗状盆地的底部，三面环山，一面濒临波光粼粼的蓝色地中海。整个城市都沐浴着西西里岛正午的金色阳光。洒落在地面的阳光略泛红色，仿佛在诉说几个世纪以来发生在西西里的流血冲突。太阳给希腊神庙雄伟的大理石石柱、细长的穆斯林塔楼、精雕细刻的西班牙大教堂的正面都抹上了一层金色。在远处的山丘上，诺曼古城堡的垛口依稀可见。这些都是基督诞生前曾经统治西西里的残暴军队留下的。在古堡城墙的另一侧，圆锥形的山体紧紧环抱着有几分柔弱的巴勒莫市，仿佛一道绳索紧紧地绕在这座城市的脖子上，群山和城市好像都优雅地跪着。再往上，在蔚蓝的天空中，有数不清的小红隼鹰在振翅翱翔。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Michael walked toward the three men waiting for him at the end of the pier. Features and bodies formed out of their black rectangles. With each step he could see them more clearly and they seemed to loosen, to spread away from each other as if to envelop him in their greeting.</div>

<div class="line_en">All three of these men knew Michael's history. That he was the youngest son of the great Don Corleone in America, the Godfather, whose power extended even into Sicily. That he had murdered a high police official of New York City while executing an enemy of the Corleone Empire. That he had been in hiding and exile here in Sicily because of those murders and that now finally, matters having been "arranged," he was on his way back to his homeland to resume his place as crown prince to the Corleone Family. They studied Michael, the way he moved so quickly and effortlessly, his watchful wariness, the caved-in side of his face which gave him the look of a man who had endured suffering and danger. He was obviously a man of "respect."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们都了解迈克尔的底细：他是人在美国，但势力触及西西里岛的“教父”唐·柯里昂的小儿子；他在处决一个柯里昂家族的仇人的时候还杀死了纽约市的一名高级警官。由于这两起命案，他一直在西西里岛避风，过着流亡生活。现在终于有了“安排”。他准备重返故土，继续当柯里昂家族的王储。他们打量着迈克尔，他步履轻快，略显疲惫，但十分警觉。他双颊凹陷，像个历经苦难和危险的人。他显然是一个“值得尊敬”的人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As Michael stepped off the pier the first man to greet him was a priest, body plump in cassock, his head crowned by a greasy batlike hat. The white clerical collar was sprinkled with red Sicilian dust, the face above was worldly with flesh.</div>

<div class="line_en">This was Father Beniamino Malo, brother to the great Don Croce. He had a shy and pious manner, but he was devoted to his renowned relative and never flinched at having the devil so close to his bosom. The malicious even whispered that he handed over the secrets of the confessional to Don Croce.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他就是龙头老大唐·克罗切的胞弟本杰明诺·马洛神父。他举止腼腆虔诚，对名声在外的哥哥忠心耿耿，从不顾忌与魔鬼过从甚密。有些居心不良的人私下议论，说他把忏悔者的秘密都告诉了唐·克罗切。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The second man was not so cordial, though polite enough. This was Inspector Federico Velardi, head of the Security Police of all Sicily. He was the only one of the three who did not have a welcoming smile on his face. Thin and far too beautifully tailored for a man who received a government salary, his cold blue eyes shot two genetic bullets from long-ago Norman conquerors. Inspector Velardi could have no love for an American who killed high-ranking police officials. He might try his luck in Sicily. Velardi's handshake was like the touching of swords.</div>

<div class="line_en">The third man was taller and bulkier; he seemed huge beside the other two. He imprisoned Michael's hand, then pulled him forward into an affectionate embrace. "Cousin Michael," he said. "Welcome to Palermo." He drew back and regarded Michael with a fond but wary eye. "I am Stefano Andolini, your father and I grew up together in Corleone. I saw you in America, when you were a child. Do you remember me?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第三个人又高又壮，与那两个人站在一起显得很魁梧。他紧紧握着迈克尔的手，把他拉向自己来了个热烈拥抱。“迈克尔老弟，”他喊了一声，“欢迎你到巴勒莫来。”随后他松开双臂，用好奇而又审慎的目光打量着迈克尔。“我是斯特凡·安多里尼，和你父亲一起在柯里昂家族里长大的。我在美国见过你，那时候你还小。你记得我吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Oddly enough Michael did remember. For Stefano Andolini was that rarest of all Sicilians, a redhead. Which was his cross, for Sicilians believe that Judas was a redheaded man. His face too was unforgettable. The mouth was huge and irregular, the thick lips like bloody hacked meat; above were hairy nostrils, and eyes cavernous in deep sockets. Though he was smiling, it was a face that made you dream of murder.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="奇怪的是，迈克尔居然还记得。斯特凡·安多里尼的红棕色头发在西西里人当中极为罕见，这使他非常烦恼，因为西西里人认为犹大也是红头发。他的面孔同样令人难忘。他的嘴很大，但形状不规则，血红的厚嘴唇像刚切下的鲜肉，嘴唇上方是毛茸茸的鼻孔，两只眼睛嵌在深深的眼窝里。虽然他面带笑容，但是看见这张面孔的人肯定会做噩梦。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">With the priest, Michael understood the connection at once. But Inspector Velardi was a surprise. Andolini, carrying out the responsibility of a relative, carefully explained to Michael the Inspector's official capacity. Michael was wary. What was the man doing here? Velardi was reputed to be one of Salvatore Guiliano's most implacable pursuers. And it was obvious that the Inspector and Stefano Andolini disliked each other; they behaved with the exquisite courtesy of two men readying themselves for a duel to the death.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈克尔立刻意识到神父与此事的联系，但韦拉尔迪警督的出现则使他颇感意外。安多里尼尽了一名亲友的责任，很有分寸地向迈克尔介绍了韦拉尔迪的官方身份。迈克尔顿生警觉。这个人来干什么？韦拉尔迪是萨尔瓦多·吉里安诺最锲而不舍的追捕者之一。斯特凡·安多里尼和警督之间显然结怨颇深。他们就像两个准备决斗的人，只是表面上彬彬有礼。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The chauffeur had the car door open for them. Father Beniamino and Stefano Andolini ushered Michael into the back seat with deferential pats. Father Beniamino insisted with Christian humility that Michael sit by the window while he sat in the middle, for Michael must see the beauties of Palermo. Andolini took the other back seat. The Inspector had already jumped in beside the chauffeur. Michael noticed that Inspector Velardi held the door handle so that he could twist it open quickly. The thought passed through Michael's mind that perhaps Father Beniamino had scurried into the middle seat to make himself less of a target.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="司机替他们打开车门。本杰明诺神父和斯特凡·安多里尼礼貌地轻轻拍了拍迈克尔，请他坐到后座上。本杰明诺神父表现出基督教的恭谦，非要坐在中间的座位上，让迈克尔靠车窗坐，因为他觉得迈克尔一定要看看巴勒莫的美丽景色。安多里尼在后座的另一侧坐下。韦拉尔迪警督早就钻进车里，坐在副驾驶的座位上。迈克尔注意到，警督紧紧抓着车门的把手，为的是随时快速打开车门。迈克尔心下思忖，本杰明诺神父赶紧坐到中间那个座位上，是想减少成为袭击目标的可能性。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Like a great black dragon, the car moved slowly through the streets of Palermo. On this avenue rose graceful Moorish-looking houses, massive Greek-columned public buildings, Spanish cathedrals. Private houses painted blue, painted white, painted yellow, all had balconies festooned with flowers that formed another highway above their heads. It would have been a pretty sight except for squads of carabinieri, the Italian National Police, who patrolled every corner, rifles at the ready. And more of them on the balconies above.</div>

<div class="line_en">Their car dwarfed the other vehicles surrounding it, especially the mule-drawn peasant carts which carried in most of the fresh produce from the countryside. These carts were painted in gay, vivid colors, every inch of them down to the spokes of the wheels, the shafts that held the mules. On the sides of many carts were murals showing helmeted knights and crowned kings in dramatic scenes from the legends of Charlemagne and Roland, those ancient heroes of Sicilian folklore. But on some carts Michael saw scrawled, beneath the figure of a handsome youth in moleskin trousers and sleeveless white shirt, guns in his belt, guns slung over his shoulder, a legend of two lines which always ended with great red letters that spelled out the name Guiliano.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="与周围的车辆，尤其是那些从农村运送新鲜农产品进城的骡车相比，他们的轿车鹤立鸡群。不过那些骡车都漆了生动明快的颜色，就连车轮的辐条和驾骡的车辕也不例外。许多骡车的侧面都画着富有情节的画，有戴头盔的武士，也有戴王冠的国王，这些人物都出自西西里流传下来的查理大帝与罗兰的古老民间传说。不过有些车上画着的是一个穿鼹鼠皮裤和无袖白衬衣的英俊青年，他腰里别着枪、肩上挎着枪，两行简短的故事后面总用红色的大写字母写着一个名字：吉里安诺。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">During his exile in Sicily, Michael had heard a good deal about Salvatore Guiliano. His name had always been in the newspapers. People everywhere talked about him. Michael's bride, Apollonia, had confessed that every night she said prayers for the safety of Guiliano, as did nearly all the children and young people of Sicily. They adored him, he was one of them, he was the man they all dreamed of becoming. Young, in his twenties, he was acclaimed a great general because he outfought the carabinieri armies sent against him. He was handsome and he was generous, he gave most of his criminal earnings to the poor. He was virtuous and his bandits were never permitted to molest women or priests. When he executed an informer or a traitor, he always gave the victim time to say his prayers and cleanse his soul in order to be on the best of terms with the rulers of the next world. All this Michael knew without being briefed.</div>

<div class="line_en">The doors opened into a magnificent suite of rooms; open French windows revealed a luxuriously deep garden beyond, which blew in the smell of lemon trees. As they entered Michael could see two men posted on the inside of the suite. Michael wondered why Don Croce was so heavily guarded. He was Guiliano's friend, he was the confidant of the Minister of Justice in Rome and therefore safe from the carabinieri who filled the town of Palermo. Then who, and what, did the great Don fear? Who was his enemy?</div>

<div class="line_en">The furniture in the living room of the suite had been originally designed for an Italian palace -- gargantuan armchairs, sofas as long and deep as small ships, massive marble tables that looked as if they had been stolen from museums. They suitably framed the man who now came in from the garden to greet them. His arms were held out to embrace Michael Corleone. Standing, Don Croce was almost as wide as he was tall. Thick gray hair, crinkly as a Negro's, carefully barbered, crowned a head massively leonine. His eyes were lizardly dark, two raisins embedded on top of heavily fleshed cheeks. These cheeks were two great slabs of mahogany, the left side planed smooth, the other creased with overgrown flesh. The mouth was surprisingly delicate, and above it was a thin mustache. The thick imperial spike of a nose nailed his face together.</div>

He did this with an intense interest, a genuine concern that it was a matter of importance for his new friend to eat and drink well.

It is now difficult to keep my part of the bargain." He held up his hand to keep Michael from interrupting. "Through no fault of my own. I have not changed.

<div class="line_en">And even as he said this he wondered why it was so important for his father to have Guiliano escape. Michael desperately wanted to get home after so many years of exile. He worried about his father's health. When Michael had fled America his father had been lying, critically wounded, in the hospital. Since his flight his older brother Sonny had been murdered. The Corleone Family had been engaged in a desperate battle for survival against the Five Families of New York. A battle that had reached from America into the heart of Sicily to kill Michael's young bride. It was true that messengers from his father had brought news that the old Don had recovered from his wounds, that he had made peace with the Five Families, that he had arranged for all charges against Michael to be dropped. But Michael knew that his father was waiting for him to come to be his right-hand man. That everyone in his family would be anxious to see him -- his sister, Connie, his brother Freddie, his foster brother, Tom Hagen, and his poor mother, who would certainly still be grieving over the death of Sonny. Michael thought fleetingly of Kay -- would she still be thinking of him after his vanishing for two years? But the crucial thing was: Why was his father delaying his return? It could only be for something of the utmost importance connected with Guiliano.</div>

By you and your people. A fast ship will take us to Africa. We will of course have the necessary papers of identity. From Africa we fly to America where it has been arranged for us to enter without the usual formalities. I hope it will be as easy as they have made it sound." He paused for a moment.

<div class="line_en">The Don sighed and drank from his glass. Then he fixed his eyes on Michael. He started to speak slowly and impressively. "Sicily is a tragic land," he said. "There is no trust. There is no order. Only violence and treachery in abundance. You look wary, my young friend, and you have every right. And so, too, our Guiliano. Let me tell you this: Turi Guiliano could not have survived without my protection; he and I have been two fingers on one hand. And now he thinks me his enemy. Ah, you can't know what sorrow this brings me. My only dream is that one day Turi Guiliano can return to his family and be acclaimed the champion of Sicily. He is a true Christian and a brave man. And with a heart so tender that he has won the love of every Sicilian." Don Croce paused and drank off a glass of wine. "But the tide has turned against him. He is alone in the mountains with barely a handful of men to face the army that Italy sends against him. And he has been betrayed at every turn. So he trusts no one, not even himself."</div>

<div class="line_en">The road from Palermo to Montelepre was no more than a one-hour drive.

Stefano Andolini drove the tiny Fiat, and in the afternoon sun his close-shaved cheeks and chin blazed with countless grains of scarlet hair roots.

They passed tiny villages of stone houses that were precariously balanced on steep slopes. These slopes were carefully gardened into terraced narrow fields growing neat rows of spiky green plants. Small hills were studded with countless huge white boulders half-buried in moss and bamboo stalks; in the distance they looked like vast unsculptured cemeteries.</div>

<div class="line_en">He would have to find his own way, Michael thought, or perhaps abandon the mission and hurry home. He was on dangerous ground here, there was obviously some sort of vendetta between Guiliano and Don Croce and to be caught in the vortex of a Sicilian vendetta was suicidal.

On this Catholic island, statues of a weeping Jesus in every home, Christian forgiveness was a contemptible refuge of the coward.</div>

Dominating the room was a huge enlargement of a photograph, too fuzzy to be recognizable, framed in oval cream-colored wood. Michael knew immediately this must be Salvatore Guiliano. Beneath, on a small round black table, was a votive light. On another table was a framed picture defined more clearly. Father, mother and son stood against a red curtain, the son with his arm possessively around his mother. Salvatore Guiliano looked directly into the camera, as if challenging it. The face was extraordinarily handsome, like that of a Grecian statue, the features a little heavy as though wrought in marble, the lips full and sensual, the eyes oval with half-closed lids set wide apart.

Now more than seven hundred of our citizens are in jail, arrested for conspiracy with my son. They are innocent, most of them, but the government arrests them to frighten the others, to make them inform against my Turi. There are over two thousand National Police around this town and other thousands hunt Turi in the mountains. And so people no longer eat their dinner out of doors, their children can no longer play in the street. The police are such cowards they fire their guns if a rabbit runs across the road. There is a curfew after dark, and if a woman of the town wants to visit a neighbor and is caught they offer her indignities and insults. The men they cart off to torture in their Palermo dungeons." He sighed. "Such things could never happen in America. I curse the day I left."</div>

He was dressed in an exquisitely tailored gray pin-striped suit, and a wide, rich-looking silver-toned tie rode down his creamy white shirt.

Michael ate slowly, aware they were all watching him, judging him. The food was very plain but good, spaghetti with the black inky sauce of squid and rabbit stew, hot with red pepper tomato sauce.

<div class="line_en">It read: "For five years I have fought to make Sicily free. I have given to the poor what I have taken from the rich. Let the people of Sicily speak out whether I am an outlaw or a fighter for freedom. If they speak against me, I will deliver myself into your hands for judgment. As long as they speak for me I will continue to wage total war."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="信上说：“五年来，我一直在为西西里的自由而战。我把从富人那里得来的东西分给了穷人。请西西里的人民来评判一下，我究竟是土匪强盗，还是自由战士。如果他们反对我，我就主动送上门听候你们发落。只要他们支持我，我就继续发动全面进攻。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It sure as hell didn't sound like a bandit on the run, Michael thought, as Maria Lombardo's proud face beamed at him. He felt an identification with her, she looked very much like his own mother. Her face was seamed with past sorrows, but her eyes blazed with a natural love for even more combat against her fate.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛丽亚·隆巴尔多看着他，脸上露出自豪的微笑。迈克尔心想，这肯定不像被通缉的土匪说的话。他十分同情她，觉得她很像自己的母亲。她的脸上留有过去的伤痛，可是她的眼睛里却不由自主地流露出与命运抗争的热情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Finally it was dawn and Michael rose and said his goodbyes. He was surprised when Guiliano's mother gave him a warm embrace.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="终于等到了黎明。迈克尔站起身，与他们道别。使他感到惊讶的是，吉里安诺的母亲走上前来热烈地拥抱了他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You remind me of my son," she said. "I trust you." She went to the mantel and took down a wooden statue of the Virgin Mary. It was black. The features were Negroid. "Take this as a gift. It is the only thing I own worthy to give you." Michael tried to refuse, but she pressed it on him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你使我想起了我的儿子，”她说道，“我相信你。”她走到壁炉架前面，取下一个圣母玛利亚的木雕像。它是黑色的，具有黑人的相貌特征。“这是个小礼物，拿去吧。这是我唯一值得给你的东西。”迈克尔不想拿，但是她硬把它塞进了他的手里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Michael watched Pisciotta take his leave of Guiliano's mother. He could see the real affection between them. Pisciotta kissed her on both cheeks and patted her reassuringly.
