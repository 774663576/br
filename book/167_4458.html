<div class="line_en">"Yai!" the girl shouted, the spear darting out. The wolf slid to the left and leapt before she could draw back the spear. Meera cast her net, the tangles unfolding in the air before her. Summer's leap carried him into it. He dragged it with him as he slammed into her chest and knocked her over backward. Her spear went spinning away. The damp grass cushioned her fall but the breath went out of her in an "Oof." The wolf crouched atop her.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="梅拉不住摇头。“难道他从不生气？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Not with me." Bran grabbed the wolf by his ears and Summer snapped at him fiercely, but it was all in play. "Sometimes he tears my garb but he's never drawn blood."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“那是你的血。如果他刚才弄穿了网子…”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He wouldn't hurt you. He knows I like you." All of the other lords and knights had departed within a day or two of the harvest feast, but the Reeds had stayed to become Bran's constant companions. Jojen was so solemn that Old Nan called him "little grandfather," but Meera reminded Bran of his sister Arya. She wasn't scared to get dirty, and she could run and fight and throw as good as a boy. She was older than Arya, though; almost sixteen, a woman grown. They were both older than Bran, even though his ninth name day had finally come and gone, but they never treated him like a child.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“也不会伤害你。他知道我喜欢你。”众位领主骑士在丰收宴会后的一两天便相继离开了临冬城，只有黎德家这两个少年留下来陪伴布兰。玖健总是很严肃，弄得老奶妈称他为“小个子祖父”，而梅拉却让他想起姐姐艾莉亚。和二姐一样，她也从不怕弄脏衣服，喜欢像个男孩子一样跑跳打闹、投掷东西。不过，她比艾莉亚大得多，都快十六岁，是成年女人了。而自己呢，虽说好不容易盼到了第九个命名日，却仍比他们姐弟年纪都小，所幸他们从不把他当小孩子看待。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Summer, to me." Bran spread his arms. "Watch," he said, an instant before the wolf bowled into him. He clung with all his strength as the wolf dragged him bumping through the grass. They wrestled and rolled and clung to each other, one snarling and yapping, the other laughing. In the end it was Bran sprawled on top, the mud-spattered direwolf under him. "Good wolf," he panted. Summer licked him across the ear.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“夏天，过来，”布兰张开手臂。“看这里。”他说，于是狼飞一般地朝他跑来。他立刻积蓄起全身力量，任狼飞奔过来把他又拖又撞地弄倒在草地上。他们扭打着、翻滚着，难舍难分，一个又吠又闹，另一个只管嘻笑。最后布兰翻到了上面，沾满泥巴的冰原狼被压在身下。“乖狼狼，”他喘着气说。夏天舔了舔他的耳朵。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I wish you were our wards instead of the Walders." He began to struggle toward the nearest tree. His dragging and wriggling was unseemly to watch, but when Meera moved to lift him he said, "No, don't help me." He rolled clumsily and pushed and squirmed backward, using the strength of his arms, until he was sitting with his back to the trunk of a tall ash. "See, I told you." Summer lay down with his head in Bran's lap. "I never knew anyone who fought with a net before," he told Meera while he scratched the direwolf between the ears. "Did your master-at-arms teach you net-fighting?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我真希望我们家的养子是你们而不是瓦德兄弟，”他挣扎着向最近的树木爬去。那种扭动拖曳的姿势一定很难看，但当梅拉伸出援手时，他却说，“别，我不要人帮忙。”他笨拙地翻身，蠕动着前进，用尽双手的力量，终于把背靠到大芩树的树干上。“你看，我就说不用帮嘛，”夏天把头放在布兰膝上。“我以前真没见过谁用网子打架的，”他边挠冰原狼耳背边对梅拉说。“这是你家教头教的吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Now?" Bran had spent his whole life at Winterfell. He yearned to see far places. "I could ask Ser Rodrik when he returns." The old knight was off east, trying to set to rights the trouble there. Roose Bolton's bastard had started it by seizing Lady Hornwood as she returned from the harvest feast, marrying her that very night even though he was young enough to be her son. Then Lord Manderly had taken her castle. To protect the Hornwood holdings from the Boltons, he had written, but Ser Rodrik had been almost as angry with him as with the bastard. "Ser Rodrik might let me go. Maester Luwin never would."</div>
