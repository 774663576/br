<div class="line_en">The man in the white shirt has been observing him without the slightest hint of emotion through the entire conversation. In fact, whenever Ove has met him, he has been more like a machine than a person. Just like all the other white shirts Ove has run into in his life. The ones who said Sonja was going to die after the coach accident, the ones who refused to take responsibility afterwards and the ones who refused to hold others responsible. The ones who would not build an access ramp at the school. The ones who did not want to let her work. The ones who went through paragraphs of small print to root out some clause meaning they wouldn't have to pay out any insurance money. The ones who wanted to put her in a home.</div>

<div class="line_en">The next morning, after letting the cat out, he fetched Sonja's father's old rifle from the attic. He'd decided that his dislike of weapons could never be greater than his dislike of all the empty places she has left behind in their silent little house. It was time now.</div>

<div class="line_en">But when Ove says that thing about there being nothing good on TV, he sees a little twitch at the temple of the white shirt. A flash of frustration, perhaps. Amazed anger, possibly. Pure disdain, very likely. It's the first time Ove has noticed that he's managed to get under the skin of the white shirt. Of any white shirt at all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但正当欧维说完电视没什么好看的时候，他头一次看到那个穿白衬衫的人太阳穴处有一丝颤动。一丝挫败感，大概是。盛怒，或许吧。鄙夷，很可能。但这是欧维头一回清楚地看到自己踩到了白衬衫的尾巴。所有白衬衫中，这是头一回。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They had all had the same empty eyes. As if they were nothing but shiny shells walking around, grinding away at normal people and pulling their lives to pieces.</div>

<div class="line_en">The man snaps his jaws shut, turns around, and starts to walk away. Not with the measured, objective steps of a council employee in full control, but something else. With anger. Impatience. Vengefully.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那人咬紧牙关，转身离开。但不再是政府公务员那种气定神闲的步伐，有些别的情绪在其中：愤怒、难耐、仇恨。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Of course, he was supposed to have died today. He had been planning to calmly and peacefully shoot himself in the head just after breakfast. He'd tidied the kitchen and let the cat out and made himself comfortable in his favorite armchair. He'd planned it this way because the cat routinely asked to be let out at this time. One of the few traits of the cat that Ove was highly appreciative of was its reluctance to crap in other people's homes. Ove was a man of the same ilk.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="今天他本来应该死的。他原本打算一吃完早饭就平平静静地往自己脑袋上来一枪。他收拾干净厨房，放走猫，从阁楼上拿下枪，心平气和地往靠椅上一坐。他这样安排，是因为猫咪照例会在这个时间要求出门解决生理问题。这是猫身上少有的一个让他欣赏的品质：它们不喜欢在别人家拉。欧维也是这样的人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But then of course Parvaneh came banging on his door as if it were the last functioning toilet in the civilized world. As if that woman had nowhere to wee at home. Ove put the rifle away behind the radiator so she wouldn't see it and start interfering. He opened the door and she more or less had to press her telephone into his hand by violent means before he accepted it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时候，当然是帕尔瓦娜敲响了他家的门，就像门背后是人类文明里仅剩的一间可用厕所。就像她家容不得她撒尿，女人。欧维把枪藏到暖气片后，省得她看见以后又要插嘴。他打开门后，她把手机一推，强行摁在他手里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"They're going to take Rune away from Anita," says Parvaneh urgently, snatching the front door open before Ove has even reached the handle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他们想把鲁尼从安妮塔身边带走！”还没等欧维上锁，帕尔瓦娜边喊着边顺手就把门打开了，眼里满是震惊。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One might have expected Ove to watch them with a look of triumph in his eyes. He would probably have expected this himself, in fact. But instead he just looks sad and tired. As if he hasn't slept in months. As if he hardly has the strength to keep his arms up any longer. He lets his hands glide into his pockets and goes back home. But no sooner has he closed the door than someone starts banging on it again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="也许有人以为，欧维会在他背后行着胜利的注目礼。他也以为自己会这么做。但他看起来却悲伤而疲惫，就像几个月没合眼了，累得连手都举不起来。他垂下双手插进口袋里，转身回家。刚关上门，又有人敲门。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Pah," Ove snorts tiredly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“唉。”欧维疲惫地应了一声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"This was very silly of you, Ove. This was very, very silly," he hisses finally.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这太蠢了，欧维。这实在是太蠢了。”他最后愤愤地吐出这句话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The resignation in his voice clearly takes both Parvaneh and Anita, who's standing behind her, by surprise. Maybe it also surprises Ove. He inhales quickly through his nose. Looks at Anita. She's grayer and more sunken than ever; her eyes are red, swollen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="嗓音中的无奈显然吓到了帕尔瓦娜和她身后的安妮塔。或许连他自己都吓了一跳。他用鼻子短促地吸着气，看了看安妮塔。她比以往更灰沉萎靡。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Maybe it's the sight of Anita's worn-out face. Maybe it's the insight that a simple battle won is nothing in the greater scheme of things. A boxed-in Škoda makes no difference. They always come back. Just like they did with Sonja. Like they always do. With their clauses and documents. Men in white shirts always win. And men like Ove always lose people like Sonja. And nothing can bring her back to him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="或许是因为看到了安妮塔憔悴的面容，或许只是意识到一场小小的胜利对全局多么微不足道。困住一辆斯柯达根本无足轻重。他们还会回来。就像他们对索雅做的一样，一如既往。凭着那些条款，捧着那些文件，穿白衬衫的人总能赢。而欧维这样的男人总是会失去索雅这样的女人，没人会把她还给他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the end, there is nothing left but a long series of weekdays with nothing more meaningful than oiling the kitchen counters. And Ove can't cope with it anymore. He feels it in that moment more clearly than ever. He can't fight anymore. Doesn't want to fight anymore. Just wants it all to stop.</div>

<div class="line_en">Parvaneh keeps trying to argue with him, but he just closes the door. She hammers at it but he doesn't listen. He sinks down on the stool in the hall and feels his hands trembling. His heart thumps so hard that it feels like his ears are about to explode. The pressure on his chest, as if an enormous darkness has put its boot over his throat, doesn't begin to release till more than twenty minutes later.</div>
