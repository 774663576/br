<div class="line_en">That was where the archers hid and slew poor Cleos Frey, she thought… but half a mile farther on she passed another wall that looked much like the first and found herself uncertain. The rutted road turned and twisted, and the bare brown trees looked different from the green ones she remembered. Had she ridden past the place where Ser Jaime had snatched his cousin's sword from its scabbard? Where were the woods they'd fought in? The stream where they'd splashed and slashed at one another until they drew the Brave Companions down upon them?</div>

<div class="line_en">Not well enough. Brienne did not doubt the boy's courage, only his training. A squire he might be, in name at least, but the men he'd squired for had served him ill.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但不够熟练。布蕾妮毫不怀疑男孩的勇气，只是不放心他的训练水平。虽然他名义上是个侍从，但他侍奉的人对他的武艺没有帮助。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She had gotten his story out of him in fits and starts on the road from Duskendale. His was a lesser branch of House Payne, an impoverished offshoot sprouted from the loins of a younger son. His father had spent his life squiring for richer cousins and had sired Podrick upon a chandler's daughter he'd wed before going off to die in the Greyjoy Rebellion. His mother had abandoned him with one of those cousins when he was four, so she could run after a wandering singer who had put another baby in her belly. Podrick did not remember what she looked like. Ser Cedric Payne had been the nearest thing to a parent the boy had ever known, though from his stammered stories it seemed to Brienne that cousin Cedric had treated Podrick more like a servant than a son. When Casterly Rock called its banners, the knight had taken him along to tend his horse and clean his mail. Then Ser Cedric had been slain in the riverlands whilst fighting in Lord Tywin's host.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="离开暮谷城北行的路上，她断断续续问出了他的故事。原来他出于派恩家族的旁支，源自某个排行靠后的儿孙，家境贫困，他父亲终其一生都在为有钱的亲戚当侍从，最后跟蜡烛铺老板的女儿结婚，生下波德瑞克之后，就在平定葛雷乔伊叛乱的战争中阵亡了。他四岁时，母亲抛弃了他，将他交给一个亲戚，自己跟让她怀孩子的流浪歌手跑了。波德瑞克已经不记得母亲长什么样，对他而言，塞德里克·派恩爵士算是最接近父亲的角色，然而从他结结巴巴的叙述来看，布蕾妮感觉这个塞德里克对待波德瑞克更像仆人而不是儿子。当初凯岩城召集封臣出兵时，骑士带上他照顾马匹，清洗盔甲。接着，塞德里克爵士在泰温公爵军中战死在三河流域。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ser Cedric had taught Podrick how to groom a horse and check his shoes for stones, and Ser Lorimer had taught him how to steal, but neither had given him much training with a sword. The Imp at least had dispatched him to the Red Keep's master-at-arms when they came to court. But during the bread riots Ser Aron Santagar had been amongst those slain, and that had been the end of Podrick's training.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="塞德里克爵士教会了波德瑞克如何照顾马匹，如何检查鞋子里的石头，罗里默爵士则教他偷东西，但他们都没空陪他练剑。小恶魔至少曾送他去红堡的教头那里受训，可惜艾伦·桑塔加爵士死于君临暴动，波德瑞克的训练也到此为止。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Far from home, alone, and penniless, the boy had attached himself to a fat hedge knight named Ser Lorimer the Belly, who was part of Lord Lefford's contingent, charged with protecting the baggage train. "The boys who guard the foodstuffs always eat the best," Ser Lorimer liked to say, until he was discovered with a salted ham he'd stolen from Lord Tywin's personal stores. Tywin Lannister chose to hang him as a lesson to other looters. Podrick had shared the ham and might have shared the rope as well, but his name had saved him. Ser Kevan Lannister took charge of him, and sometime later sent the boy to squire for his nephew Tyrion.</div>

<div class="line_en">Brienne cut two wooden swords from fallen branches to get a sense of Podrick's skills. The boy was slow of speech but not of hand, she was pleased to learn. Though fearless and attentive, he was also underfed and skinny, and not near strong enough. If he had survived the Battle of the Blackwater as he claimed, it could only be because no one thought him worth the killing. "You may call yourself a squire," she told him, "but I've seen pages half your age who could have beat you bloody. If you stay with me, you'll go to sleep with blisters on your hands and bruises on your arms most every night, and you'll be so stiff and sore you'll hardly sleep. You don't want that."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布蕾妮砍下两根断枝当剑，试了试波德瑞克的身手。她高兴地发现，男孩嘴笨手不笨。然而，尽管他勇敢又专注，但营养不良，骨瘦如柴，不够强壮。假如他真像自己声称的那样，在黑水河战役中存活了下来，只可能是因为没人拿他当目标。“你可以自称为侍从，”她告诉他，“但年龄只及你一半的侍酒都能把你打得很惨。你若留在我身边，以后每晚睡觉时，手上将全是水泡，胳膊布满淤青，浑身僵硬酸痛，难以入眠。你不会喜欢的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So far he had been true to his word, and Brienne had been true to hers. Podrick had not complained. Every time he raised a new blister on his sword hand, he felt the need to show it to her proudly. He took good care of their horses too. He is still no squire, she reminded herself, but I am no knight, no matter how many times he calls me "ser." She would have sent him on his way, but he had nowhere to go. Besides, though Podrick said he did not know where Sansa Stark had gone, it might be that he knew more than he realized. Some chance remark, half-remembered, might hold the key to Brienne's quest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迄今为止，他和布蕾妮都信守承诺。波德瑞克从不抱怨。每次拿剑的手上冒出一个新水泡，他都忍不住骄傲地展示给她看。他照顾马匹也很不赖。不，他不是侍从，她提醒自己，但我也不是骑士，不管他叫我多少声“爵士”。她不能遣走他，因为他无处可去，另外，尽管波德瑞克一再声称不知道珊莎·史塔克的去向，但他有可能并未意识到自己所了解的情况。偶尔提及的一句话，模糊的记忆，或许就是布蕾妮达成目标的关键所在。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The farm folk watched them warily as they came trotting up, but once Brienne made it plain that she meant them no harm, they let her ride beside them. "We used to have an ox," the old man told her as they made their way through the weed-choked fields, lakes of soft mud, and burnt and blackened trees, "but the wolves made off with him." His face was red from the effort of pulling the cart. "They took off our daughter too and had their way with her, but she come wandering back after the battle down at Duskendale. The ox never did. The wolves ate him, I expect."</div>

<div class="line_en">The woman had little to add. She was younger than the man by twenty years, but never spoke a word, only looked at Brienne the same way she might have looked at a two-headed calf. The Maid of Tarth had seen such eyes before. Lady Stark had been kind to her, but most women were just as cruel as men. She could not have said which she found most hurtful, the pretty girls with their waspish tongues and brittle laughter or the cold-eyed ladies who hid their disdain behind a mask of courtesy. And common women could be worse than either. "Maidenpool was all in ruins when last I saw it," she said. "The gates were broken and half the town was burned."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="女人没什么补充的。她比男人年轻二十岁，但一个字也没说，只是用看待双头牛犊的眼神看着布蕾妮。这种眼神，“塔斯的处女”一生中见得太多太多了，史塔克夫人固然待她宽厚仁慈，但大多数女人就跟男人一样残忍，脸长得漂亮，然而嘴巴刻薄，笑声刺耳，眼神冷漠的夫人们更将轻蔑隐藏在礼貌的盔甲背后，很难说哪种令她更痛苦。也许正是平民女人们的眼神吧。“我上次路过女泉城时，那里是一片废墟，”她告诉对方，“城门砸开，泰半房屋遭到焚烧洗劫。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"None." Not this time. The farther they had come from Duskendale, the emptier the road had been. The only travelers they'd glimpsed had melted away into the woods before they reached them, save for a big, bearded septon they met walking south with twoscore footsore followers. Such inns as they passed had either been sacked and abandoned or turned into armed camps. Yesterday they had encountered one of Lord Randyll's patrols, bristling with longbows and lances. The horsemen had surrounded them while their captain questioned Brienne, but in the end he'd let them continue on their way. "Be wary, woman. The next men you meet may not be as honest as my lads. The Hound has crossed the Trident with a hundred outlaws, and it's said they're raping every wench they come upon and cutting off their teats for trophies."</div>

Two years later he was dead, carried off by the same chill that took Lord and Lady Caron and their daughters. Had he lived, they would have been wed within a year of her first flowering, and her whole life would have been different. She would not be here now, dressed in man's mail and carrying a sword, hunting for a dead woman's child. More like she'd be at Nightsong, swaddling a child of her own and nursing another.

<div class="line_en">The sun was half-hidden behind a bank of clouds when they emerged from the blackened trees to find Maidenpool before them, with the deep waters of the bay beyond. The town's gates had been rebuilt and strengthened, Brienne saw at once, and crossbowmen walked its pink stone walls once more. Above the gatehouse floated King Tommen's royal banner, a black stag and golden lion combatant on a field divided gold and crimson. Other banners displayed the Tarly huntsman, but the red salmon of House Mooton flew only from their castle on its hill.</div>

Brienne saw new houses going up, a stone inn rising where a wooden inn had burned, a new slate roof on the town sept. The cool autumn air rang to the sounds of saw and hammer. Men carried timber through the streets, and quarrymen drove their wagons down muddy lanes. Many wore the striding huntsman on their breasts.

Not so his lords and knights. Brienne had not expected a warm welcome. She was prepared for coldness, for mockery, for hostility. She had supped upon such meat before. It was not the scorn of the many that left her confused and vulnerable, but the kindness of the few. The Maid of Tarth had been betrothed three times, but she had never been courted until she came to Highgarden.</div>

He gave her a book, beautifully illuminated and filled with a hundred tales of knightly valor. He brought apples and carrots for her horses, and a blue silk plume for her helm.

<div class="line_en">He shrugged. "He never said, but old Nimble Dick knows the smell o' fear. He come here most every night, buying drinks for sailors, making japes, singing little songs. Only one night some men come in with that hunter on their teats, and your fool went white as milk and got quiet till they left." He edged his stool closer to hers. "That Tarly's got soldiers crawling over the docks, watching every ship that comes or goes. Man wants a deer, he goes t' the woods. He wants a ship, he goes t' the docks. Your fool didn't dare. So I offered him some help."</div>
