<div class="line_en">I was desperately impatient to get on, but it took us most of the day to reach Langeoog, and we anchored that night near Baltrum, in a thick white fog. The next morning we continued our painfully slow journey, and in the afternoon I heard Davies shout at last, "There's Norderney!" I looked up and saw, through the mist, a group of grassy sandhills, exactly like a hundred others I had seen recently, but of much greater interest to me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我迫不及待地想要前进，可我们花了大半天时间才驶到朗格奥格。那晚，我们停泊在贝尔特鲁姆附近，身处白色的浓雾中。第二天早上，缓慢而痛苦的航行又开始了。到了下午，我终于听到戴维斯大喊：“诺德奈到了！”我抬起头，透过浓雾看到一群长满草的沙丘。一模一样的沙丘我近来见过不下百次了，可这一群对我而言有着较大的吸引力。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We left Bensersiel the next morning, but the wind had dropped, just when we needed it most, and sometimes we did not seem to be moving at all, but were just rolling from side to side. In the distance we saw the Blitz, travelling rapidly westwards, and I felt sure the Kormoran would also be on her way to Norderney.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天早上我们从贝瑟西尔起航，可就在我们最需要风的时候，风力却减弱了。有时船似乎一点儿都没往前走，只是左右摇晃。我们远远看到“闪电”号向西飞速前进，我几乎可以肯定，“鸬鹚”号也会到诺德奈去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Davies said nothing, and seemed to forget that he was steering the boat. We touched the sandbank, but luckily the tide pushed us away again. His next words surprised me. "Let go the anchor. Lower the sail."</div>

<div class="line_en">"That little boat," he said. "It's her, I'm sure. It's the Medusa 's dinghy. She's come to meet m --, I mean, us." He pushed the binoculars into my hand, and I saw a pretty little white sail coming closer. I kept my eyes on the boat, as I did not want to look at Davies. At last I heard him draw a deep breath. He turned to the Dulcibella's dinghy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那艘小船。”他说，“是它，我确定。那是‘美杜莎’号的小艇。她是来见我——我是指，我们的。”他把双筒望远镜塞给我，我看见一艘漂亮的白色小帆船正驶过来。我一直盯着那船，因为我不想看戴维斯。终于，我听见他深吸了一口气，朝“达尔茜贝拉”号的小艇走去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When I had done this, Davies was still staring into the mist through his binoculars, and, to my astonishment, I noticed that his hands were trembling violently. I had never seen this happen before, even at moments of great danger.</div>

<div class="line_en">I went up on deck, and found Davies with a very pretty girl, about nineteen years old. She was wearing a thick jacket, dark skirt and rubber boots, and her rose-brown skin lent a delicious touch of colour to the greyness of the sea and sky. When she looked at me and spoke, I knew immediately that she was no "Fräulein Dollmann", but as English as I was, although she must have spoken German ever since she was a child.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我走上甲板，发现戴维斯和一个19岁左右的漂亮姑娘在一起。姑娘穿着厚夹克、深色半截裙，还有橡胶靴，棕里透红的皮肤为灰蒙蒙的大海和天空增添了一抹动人的亮色。她看着我，一开口冲我说话，我立刻就知道她根本不是个德国姑娘，而是和我一样的地道英国人，只不过从小就说德语罢了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Nothing on earth could have made the Dulcibella's cabin a suitable place to receive a lady, but I did my best, putting clothes away in cupboards, a clean cloth on the table, and books back on the shelf. I had just put water on to boil for tea, when I heard the dinghy return.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“达尔茜贝拉”号的船舱再怎样也不适合招待一位出身高贵的姑娘，但我还是尽了最大努力：把衣服收进衣橱，换上干净桌布，把书放回架子上。我刚刚烧上沏茶的水，就听见小艇回来了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She looked eagerly round the yacht, asking questions about all she saw, but it was obvious that she was more interested in Davies himself. The way she looked at him, and the way he looked at her, made me feel sorry for myself, because I was not in love, and even sorrier for Davies, because I could not see how all this would end. One thing was clear, however. She could never have been involved in her father's attempt to kill Davies.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她兴致盎然地环视着游艇，看到什么都要问个问题，但显然她对戴维斯本人更感兴趣。她看他的眼神，还有他看她的目光，让我为自己没有恋人而感到难过。但我更替戴维斯难过，因为我不知道他们的爱情将有怎样的结果。不过有一点是显而易见的：她肯定没有参与她父亲除掉戴维斯的阴谋。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The difficult moment passed and a warm and friendly feeling returned to the cabin as the three of us sat down to enjoy our tea together. But that pleasant event never took place -- all because of an English name in gold-painted letters on the cover of an old book on our bookshelf. The disaster came and went so quickly that at the time I had no idea what caused it. One moment our visitor was laughing and talking to Davies, while looking through some of our books. Then suddenly there was an awful silence, and I turned round from making the tea. She was sitting quite still, with eyes wide open, and a very white, frightened face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这段尴尬的小插曲过后，船舱里又恢复了温暖、友好的气氛，我们三人坐下准备一起喝茶。可我们终归还是没喝上茶——一切都是拜一个烫金的英语名字所赐。那个名字出现在一本旧书的封面上，书放在我们的书架上。变故是在一瞬间发生的，我当时都没明白是怎么回事。我们的客人刚刚还一边笑着和戴维斯说话，一边浏览我们的一些书籍呢。接着突然间，船舱里一阵可怕的沉默，我停止泡茶，转过身来。多尔曼小姐木木地坐在那里，双眼圆睁，苍白的脸上写满恐惧。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What's the matter?" asked Davies in English, but she did not answer, and almost ran up the ladder, like a wounded animal trying to escape. She had reached the deck and jumped into the dinghy, before she realized she needed one of us to go with her and bring the boat back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“怎么了？”戴维斯用英语问道。多尔曼小姐没有回答，几乎是跑着上了梯子，像一只竭力逃跑的受了伤的小动物。她上了甲板，跳进小艇，这才意识到得有一个人跟她一起走，好把船划回来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We arrived at Norderney town in the evening, and anchored on the edge of the deep water channel, about fifty metres from the harbour entrance. We were too excited to sleep, or do anything except make plans, and talk. At last Davies's natural shyness left him, and I was able to see into the secret corners of his heart. He loved this girl, and he loved his country, and he was determined to be loyal to both of them. Somehow, a way must be found to do this.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="晚上我们到达诺德奈镇，在深水航道边上、离海港入口大约50米处停了船。我们兴奋得睡不着觉，一直在做计划、聊天。戴维斯终于克服了天生的羞怯，让我看到他内心深处最隐秘的角落。他爱这个姑娘，也爱他的祖国，并决心要忠诚于二者。他无论如何也要找到一种方法做到这一点。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After much discussion, we realized there was only one answer -- to get Dollmann, secrets and all, daughter and all, away from Germany completely. This was now our goal, and we took delight in the challenge. We had no clear idea how we would reach the goal, but there were two possible ways forward. One was to continue searching the area for clues of some kind; and the other was to use this new information about Dollmann to force him to tell us what was going on. By the time we went to bed, this second plan was the preferred one.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="充分讨论之后，我们意识到只有一个办法——把多尔曼带离德国，连同他的秘密、他的女儿，一切的一切全都带走。这就是我们现在的目标，而且我们很乐意迎接挑战。我们还不清楚该如何实现目标，但是有两种可行的解决办法：一是继续探索这片海域，寻找某种线索；二是利用这一关于多尔曼的新信息迫使他告诉我们事情的真相。到上床睡觉时，我们的结论是第二种办法更好些。">查看中文翻译</div>
