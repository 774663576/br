<div class="line_en">Throughout the day, everywhere they went they saw signs of tighter security; Professor Flitwick could be seen teaching the front doors to recognize a large picture of Sirius Black; Filch was suddenly bustling up and down the corridors, boarding up everything from tiny cracks in the walls to mouse holes. Sir Cadogan had been fired. His portrait had been taken back to its lonely landing on the seventh floor, and the Fat Lady was back. She had been expertly restored, but was still extremely nervous, and had agreed to return to her job only on condition that she was given extra protection. A bunch of surly security trolls had been hired to guard her. They paced the corridor in a menacing group, talking in grunts and comparing the size of their clubs.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ron had become an instant celebrity. For the first time in his life, people were paying more attention to him than to Harry, and it was clear that Ron was rather enjoying the experience. Though still severely shaken by the night's events, he was happy to tell anyone who asked what had happened, with a wealth of detail.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="罗恩已经立马成为名人了。人们现在对他的注意多于对哈利的，罗恩还是生平第一次遇到这样的待遇，显然很喜欢这种经验。罗恩尽管还在因为那天晚上发生的事件而大受震撼，但只要有人问，他就乐于告诉人家发生了什么事，还加上了许多细节。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry couldn't help noticing that the statue of the one-eyed witch on the third floor remained unguarded and unblocked.

<div class="line_cn" title="哈利无意中注意到四楼上独眼女巫的雕像仍旧无人守卫，也没有加以封闭。弗雷德和乔治——现在是哈利、罗恩和赫敏——认为他们是惟一知道雕像里面有秘密通道的人，看来这是对的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry had been wondering the same thing. Why had Black, having got the wrong bed, not silenced Ron and proceeded to Harry? Black had proved twelve years ago that he didn't mind murdering innocent people, and this time he had been facing five unarmed boys, four of whom were asleep.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利也对这事迷惑不解。布莱克走错了床，为什么不杀罗恩灭口继续找哈利呢？十二年以前，布莱克表明他并不在乎杀死无辜的人，这次他面对的是五名没有武装的男生，其中四人还在熟睡之中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Why, though?" Ron added to Harry as the group of secondyear girls who had been listening to his chilling tale departed. "Why did he run?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Neville was in total disgrace. Professor McGonagall was so furious with him she had banned him from all future Hogsmeade visits, given him a detention, and forbidden anyone to give him the password into the tower. Poor Neville was forced to wait. outside the common room every night for somebody to let him in, while the security trolls leered unpleasantly at him. None of these punishments, however, came close to matching the one his grandmother had in store for him. Two days after Black's break-in, she sent Neville the very worst thing a Hogwarts student could receive over breakfast -- a Howler.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="纳威丢尽了脸。麦格教授为了他气得不得了，不准他以后再去霍格莫德村；关他的禁闭，不准任何人把进入塔楼的口令给他。可怜的纳威只得每晚等在公共休息室里，看有谁能带他进去，这时候那些侏儒便令人不快地揶揄他。然而，这些惩罚都还比不上他的祖母准备好等着他的。在布莱克闯进塔楼两天以后，她给纳威寄去了东西，这是霍格沃茨的学生早饭时可能收到的最坏的东西——一封吼叫信。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The school owls swooped into the Great Hall carrying the mail as usual, and Neville choked as a huge barn owl landed in front of him, a scarlet envelope clutched in its beak. Harry and Ron, who were sitting opposite him, recognized the letter as a Howler at once -- Ron had got one from his mother the year before.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="学校的猫头鹰飞进大厅，像平时一样送来邮件，一只巨大的谷仓猫头鹰停在他面前，叼着一个猩红色的信封，纳威傻眼了。哈利和罗恩正坐在他对面，马上就认出那是一封吼叫信，罗恩去年就从他妈妈那里得到过一封。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Neville didn't need telling twice. He seized the envelope, and holding it before him like a bomb, sprinted out of the hall, while the Slytherin table exploded with laughter at the sight of him.

<div class="line_en">Right on cue, Ron came bursting into the office. He was completely out of breath, and stopped just short of Snape's desk, clutching the stitch in his chest and trying to speak.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="罗恩恰好在这时候闯进了办公室。他完全喘不上来气，刚好就站在斯内普书桌旁边，手抓胸膛试图说话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You see, Severus?" said Lupin, turning back to Snape. "It looks like a Zonko product to me --"</div>

<div class="line_en">"I don't want to hear explanations," said Lupin shortly. He glanced around the empty entrance hall and lowered his voice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不听解释。”卢平简短地说道。他瞥了空空洞洞的前厅一眼，压低了声音。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No," said Harry quickly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不认识。”哈利赶快说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well!" said Lupin, clapping his hands together and looking around cheerfully. "That seems to clear that up! Severus, I'll take this back, shall I?" He folded the map and tucked it inside his robes. "Harry, Ron, come with me, I need a word about my vampire essay -- excuse us, Severus --"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好，”卢平说，两手一拍，高兴地向大家一看，“这不就说明问题了！西弗勒斯，我把这东西拿回去，好吗？”他折起地图放到袍子里去了。“哈利，罗恩，跟我来，关于我布置的吸血鬼论文，我有句话要说。我们走了，对不起，西弗勒斯。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I -- gave -- Harry -- that -- stuff," he choked. "Bought -- it… in Zonko's… ages -- ago…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那——东西——我——给——哈利的，”他透不过气来，“好久——以前——在——佐科——买的…”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry didn't dare look at Snape as they left his office. He. Ron, and Lupin walked all the way back into the entrance hall before speaking. Then Harry turned to Lupin.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们离开了办公室，这时哈利看都不敢看斯内普一眼。他、罗恩和卢平一直走到前厅都没有说话。然后哈利转向卢平。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I happen to know that this map was confiscated by Mr. Filch many years ago. Yes, I know it's a map," he said as Harry and Ron looked amazed. "I don't want to know how it fell into your possession. I am, however, astounded that you didn't hand it in. Particularly after what happened the last time a student left information about the castle lying around. And I can't let you have it back, Harry."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我碰巧知道这张地图是费尔奇多年以前没收来的。对，我知道这是一张地图。”他说，因为哈利、罗恩露出了惊讶的神色。“我不想知道这地图怎么会到你们手里。然而，我惊讶的是你们没有交出来。特别是在上次一个学生把有关城堡的信息随手乱放以后。我不能让你再拿着它了，哈利。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Do you know them?" said Harry, impressed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你认识他们吗？”哈利问，一脸迫切的神情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry had expected that, and was too keen for explanations to protest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利早已想到了这一点，因为急于解释，也来不及抗议。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Because…," Lupin hesitated, "because these mapmakers would have wanted to lure you out of school. They'd think it extremely entertaining."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“因为…”卢平迟疑了，“因为制造地图的人有可能是想引诱你们离开学校。他们认为这张地图会很好玩。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Why did Snape think I'd got it from the manufacturers?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“斯内普为什么说我是从制造者手里直接得到的呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Don't expect me to cover up for you again, Harry. I cannot make you take Sirius Black seriously. But I would have thought that what you have heard when the dementors draw near you would have had more of an effect on you. Your parents gave their lives to keep you alive, Harry. A poor way to repay them -- gambling their sacrifice for a bag of magic tricks."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“别指望我再替你掩饰了，哈利。我不能让你认真对待小天狼星布莱克。但是我原来以为摄魂怪走近你时，你听到的内容会对你产生更大影响的。你的双亲牺牲了自己让你活下来，哈利。这样报答他们可不好——用他们的牺牲换一口袋魔术把戏。”他走开了，留下哈利在那里，哈利心里不是滋味，比他在斯内普办公室里的时候还要难过。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"We've met," he said shortly. He was looking at Harry more seriously than ever before.</div>

<div class="line_en">He walked away, leaving Harry feeling worse by far than he had at any point in Snape's office. Slowly, he and Ron mounted the marble staircase. As Harry passed the one-eyed witch, he remembered the Invisibility Cloak -- it was still down there, but he didn't dare go and get it.</div>
