<div class="line_en">Ian Whitehead sat alone at a table for two in the Covent Garden branch of Forelli's, and checked his watch: fifteen minutes late, but he imagined that this was part of the exquisite game of cat-and-mouse that is dating. Well, let the games commence. He dunked his ciabatta in the little dish of olive oil as if loading a paintbrush, opened the menu and worked out what he could afford to eat.</div>

<div class="line_en">Life as a stand-up comedian had yet to bring the wealth and TV exposure that it had once promised. The Sunday papers weekly proclaimed that comedy was the new rock and roll, so why was he still hustling for open-mike spots at Sir Laffalots on Tuesday nights? He had adapted his material to fit with current fashions, pulling back on the political and observational material and trying out character-comedy, surrealism, comic songs and sketches. Nothing seemed to raise a laugh. A detour into a more confrontational style had led to him being punched and kicked, and his residency with a Sunday night improv comedy team had proved only that he could be unfunny in an entirely unplanned, spontaneous way. Yet still he soldiered on, up and down the Northern Line, round and round the Circle, in search of the big laughs.</div>

<div class="line_en">Perhaps there was something about the name "Ian Whitehead" that made it resistant to being spelt out in lightbulbs. He had even considered changing it to something punchy, boysy and monosyllabic -- Ben or Jack or Matt -- but until he found his comic persona he had taken a job in Sonicotronics, an electronics shop on Tottenham Court Road where unhealthy young men in t-shirts sold ROM and graphics cards to unhealthy young men in t-shirts. The money wasn't great, but his evenings were free for gigs, and he frequently cracked up his co-workers with new material.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="也许是“伊恩·怀特海德”这个名字有拒人千里的意味，难以脍炙人口。他甚至考虑过改个有冲击力的时尚单音节名字，什么本、杰、麦之类。在喜剧界混得有头有脸之前，他先在托特汉姆宫“桑尼克电子”商店找了份工作。这里经营碟片和显示卡，卖主是身穿T恤衫的危险的青年男子，顾客则是他们的同类。收入不算多，不过晚上他就可以去表演，而且他的新段子在同事中倒是都能羸得爆笑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Date number two, and here he was in a sleek modern Italian near Covent Garden. Ian's personal tastes tended towards the hot and spicy, salty and crispy, and he would have preferred a curry. But he was wise enough in the vagaries of womankind to know that she would be expecting fresh vegetables. He checked his watch again -- twenty minutes late -- and felt a pang of longing in his stomach that was partly hunger, partly love. For years now his heart and stomach had been heavy with love for Emma Morley, and not just sentimental platonic love, but a carnal desire too. All these years later he still carried with him, would carry for life, the image of her standing in mismatched underwear in the staffroom of Loco Caliente, illuminated by a shaft of afternoon sun like the light in a cathedral, as she yelled at him to get out and shut the bloody door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是第二次约会了，他正坐在考文特花园附近的这家光鲜摩登的意大利餐厅里。他个人更喜欢辛辣、咸脆口味的，本想点一道咖喱，不过聪慧的他自能体察女性的喜好——新鲜蔬菜。他又看了看表，二卜分钟了，胃里一阵阵痛，掺杂着饥饿感和对爱情的渴望。多年以来，他的身心都充满了对爱玛·莫利的沉沉爱意，多愁善感的柏拉图式爱情与世俗的肉欲并举，多年来，他一直铭记着一个画面，终生难忘：她身穿非成套的内衣裤，站在洛克卡连特餐厅的员工休息室里，映着午后那宛如教堂灯光的暖阳，吆喝着让他出去把那道该死的门关好。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But the best, the very best thing about Sonicotronics was that during his lunch break he had bumped into Emma Morley. He had been standing outside the offices of the Church of Scientology, debating whether or not to take the personality test, when he saw her, almost obscured by a huge wicker laundry basket, and as he threw his arms around her Tottenham Court Road was lit by glory and transformed into a street of dreams.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而此地于他最大的好处，便是在午休时曾和爱玛·莫利不期而遇。当时他正站在“科学教会”的办公楼外，同人争论着要不要做个性测试，然后看到了隐蔽在硕大的柳条洗衣筐后面的她，于是双臂来了个熊抱。那一刻托特汉姆官路光芒炫目，变成了一条梦幻街。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Are you with someone?" asked the maîtred.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你还有同伴吗？”领班问道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Unaware that he was thinking of her underwear, Emma Morley stood watching Ian from the maître d's station and noted that he was definitely better looking these days. The crown of tight fair curls had gone, trimmed short now and slicked slightly with a little wax, he had lost that new-boy-in-the-city look. In fact, if it weren't for the terrible clothes and the way his mouth hung open, he would actually be attractive.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱玛·莫利站在领斑台后望。着伊恩，自然不知道他一脑子的淫秽想法，不过发现他的仪表明显改善了。高耸的金色馨发被利落的短发取代，上了点发胶，略显油滑，那副“刚进城的小子”的模样早已不见踪影。其实，如果不是着装太不像话，还傻张着嘴，他还是不无魅力的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Although the situation was unusual for her, she recognised this as a classic date restaurant -- just expensive enough, not too bright, not pretentious but not cheap either, the kind of place where they put rocket on the pizzas. The place was corny but not ridiculous and at least it was not a curry or, God forbid, a fish burrito. There were palm trees and candles and in the next room an elderly man played Gershwin favourites on a grand piano: "I hope that he/turns out to be/someone to watch over me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="眼下的处境她还真是不常遇到，但无碍于发觉这是个典雅的约会场所，富丽但不张扬，是那种比萨饼也能吃出珍馐美味的地方。俗气吧也有一点，但不愚蠢，至少不会卖咖喱味或鱼肉馅的墨西哥面饼。还有棕榈树、烛光，隔壁还有位老先生弹着一架大钢琴，流淌出她最爱的格什温的曲子：“我希望他！最后就是那个/守护我的人。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That man over there."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那边那个男的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On their first date he had taken her to see Evil Dead III, The Medieval Dead at the Odeon on the Holloway Road. Neither squeamish nor a snob, Emma enjoyed a horror film more than most women, but even so she had thought this a strange, curiously confident choice. Three Colours Blue was playing at the Everyman, but here she was, watching a man with a chainsaw for an arm, and finding it strangely refreshing. Conventionally, she had expected to be taken to a restaurant afterwards but for Ian it seemed a trip to the cinema wasn't complete without a three-course meal thrown in. He contemplated the concession stand as if were an à la carte menu, choosing nachos to begin with, a hot-dog for the entrée, Revels for dessert, his palette cleansed with a pail of iced Lilt the size of a human torso, so that the Evil Dead III's few meditative scenes were accompanied by the warm tropical hiss of Ian belching into his fist.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们第一次约会，他带她去霍洛威路上的奥蒂安影院看了《鬼玩人》第三部。爱玛既不故作清高，也不会吹毛求疵，有别于多数女性的是，她喜欢恐怖片。尽管如此她还是奇怪为何选择这部片子，太过猎奇而有欠考虑了。当时《蓝白红三部曲之蓝》正风靡，而她却去看了一个臂上安了链锯的男人，而且感到新鲜刺激。她一般都会看完电影再吃饭，但对伊恩来说，要是没有事先填上三道菜，电影就不算完整。他当时还算是让步了，将套餐拆开来单点，玉米薯片、热狗、热维斯巧克力。然后就着这混搭套餐，灌下了一大桶加冰块的利尔特软饮料，真诧异是怎么塞下的。电影看到兴头上时，伊恩把热带气息的饱隔喷在了自己的手心。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">That was how he grinned at her now, in the restaurant, standing with such enthusiasm that he knocked the table with his thighs, spilling tap water onto the complimentary olives.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他现在正用这样的神态对她咧嘴笑着。他站起身，热切到大腿撞到了桌子，杯里的水晃了出来，溅在橄榄油碟里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And yet despite all this -- the love of ultra-violence and salty foods, the mustard on his chin -- Emma had enjoyed herself more than she had expected. On the way to the pub he had changed sides on the pavement so that she wouldn't get hit by a runaway bus -- a weirdly old-fashioned gesture that she'd never been subject to before -- and they discussed the special effects, the beheadings and eviscerations, Ian declaring, after some analysis, that it was the best of the "Dead" trilogy. Trilogies and box-sets, comedy and horror loomed large in Ian's cultural life, and in the pub they'd had an interesting debate about whether a graphic novel could ever have as much depth and meaning as, say, Middlemarch. Protective, attentive, he was like an older brother who knew about lots of really cool stuff, the difference being that he clearly wanted to sleep with her. So intent, so doting was his gaze that she frequently found herself feeling for something on her face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他喜爱极端的暴力镜头和过咸的食物，会把芥末沾在下巴上，尽管如此，情况比爱玛预想的要乐观。去酒吧的路上，他走到她的外侧护着她，这举动老派面古怪，她不曾遇到过。他们一路聊着特效，砍头、挖内脏，一番分析后伊恩便宣称，这是《鬼玩人》三部曲里最好的一部。三部曲、套装、喜剧、恐怖片，这些构成了伊恩的文化生活。进了酒吧，他们展开了有趣的辩论，说情节生动的小说能否同时具有内涵，比如《米德尔马契》。他体贴温柔，眼界也开阔，就像个兄长，差别在于，他显然想和她上床。他看她的眼神是那么专注、执著，让她常常觉得自己脸上长了什么东西。">查看中文翻译</div>

There it was, the evening's second great bubble of love and desire for Emma Morley. "You look so lovely," he blurted, unable to contain himself.</div>

The boys on her PGCE course were all pro-am gagsters, especially in the pub after a few pints, and while it drove her crazy she knew that she encouraged it too, the girls sitting and grinning while the boys did tricks with matchsticks and jammed on Children's TV or Forgotten Confectionery of the Seventies.

<div class="line_en">Hi, Em. Me again. I know you're out on the town with Laughing Boy, but I just wanted to say that when you get in, assuming you're alone, I've decided not to go the premiere after all. I'm home all night, if you want to come round. I mean, I'd like that. I'll pay for your taxi, you could stay over. So. Anytime you come in, just give me a call, then get in a cab. That's all. Hope to see you later. Love and all that. Bye, Em. Bye.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="嗨，爱姆，又是我。我知道你去镇上会那个搞笑男生了，我只是想说，等你回了房间…你应该一个人吧。我最终决定不去那个首映式了。如果你想要过来的话，我一整晚都在家。我的意思是，我希望你来，打车钱我出，也可以睡我这儿。好了。你要过来的话，随时给我电话，然后打个车。就这些。希望一会儿见，我的好爱姆，再见，爱姆。再见。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They reminisced about the old times, all of three years ago. While Emma had the soup then fish, Ian had gone for a medley of carbohydrates, starting with an immense bowl of meaty pasta which he buried between snow banks of parmesan. This and the red wine had sedated him a little, and Emma had relaxed too, was in fact well on her way to drunkenness. And why not? Didn't she deserve it? The last ten months had been spent working hard at something she believed in, and though some of the teaching placements had been frankly terrifying, she was clear-sighted enough to realise she was good at it. At her interview this afternoon they had obviously felt the same way, the headmaster nodding and smiling in approval, and though she didn't dare say it out loud, she knew that she had the job.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们回忆了过去的时光，三年前的种种往事。爱玛喝汤吃鱼，伊恩吃起了主食，从大碗意大利肉酱面下手，撒上一层冰天雪地般的意大利芝士粉，吃去一层，再撒一层。酒食让他安静下来，爱玛也觉得放松了——其实是在向醉酒逼近。有何不可呢？难道不是她该享受的吗？过去的十个月，她为自己的信念和理想而奋斗。有些教学活动确实让人生畏，但她心如明镜，深知这一行正是自己擅长的。F午的面试，对方显然也有同感，校长赞许地点头微笑。尽管她还不敢张扬，心里却有把握拿到这份工作。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Not really. I bumped into Scott once, in Hail Caesar's, that awful Italian. He was fine, still angry. Apart from that, I try to avoid it. It's a bit like prison -- best not to associate with the old lags. Except you of course."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可以说没有。在剧院撞见过一回，那个吓人的意大利人。他一切都好，还是气冲冲的样子。其他老同事我都尽力回避。那地方像监狱——还是别和老难友联系为好。当然你是例外。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So why not celebrate with Ian? As he talked, she scrutinised his face and decided that he was definitely more attractive than he used to be; looking at him, she no longer thought of tractors. There was nothing refined or delicate about him; if you were casting a war film, he'd be the plucky Tommy maybe, writing letters to his mum, while Dexter would be -- what? An effete Nazi. Even so, she liked the way he looked at her. Fond, that was the word. Fond and drunk, and she too felt heavy-limbed and sultry and fond of him in return.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="何不同伊恩一道庆祝呢？她听着他说话，端详着他的脸，肯定他变得更有魅力了，不冉让人联想到拖拉机。气质不算儒雅，五官不算精致，如果要拍一部战争电影，他倒是能演个无畏的大兵，给母亲写写信（德克斯特会写），恐怕是个笔力枯燥的纳粹。尽管如此，她还是喜欢他看她的眼神。多情，这个词最贴切。多情而醉意蒙蒙，而她的四肢也沉重起来，用放肆而多情的眼神回望着他。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He smiled ruefully and nudged her knuckles with his. "That why you didn't answer my phone-calls?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他感慨地微笑着，用指关节捅了捅她的指关节，“你不接我的电话就是因为这个？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, alright. I've got this improv gig which is real seat-of-the-pants stuff, really unpredictable. Sometimes I'm just not funny at all! But I suppose that's the joy of improv, isn't it?" Emma wasn't sure that this was true, but nodded just the same. "And I do this Tuesday night gig at Mr Chuckles in Kennington. It's a bit more hard-edged, more topical. Like I do this kind of Bill Hicks thing about advertising? Like the stupid adverts on TV?…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，挺好。我参加了一个即兴表演团体，全是些临场发挥的演出，让人意外。有时候我一点也不出彩！这大概就是魅力所在，对吗？”爱玛说不上来，只是跟着点头。他继续道：“我在坎星顿参加周二演出。风格会稍微严肃一点，主题性也更强一些。想不想听我学比尔希克斯说广告的段子。堪比愚蠢的电视广告…”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He slipped into his routine and Emma freeze-framed her smile. It would kill him to say it but in all the time she had known Ian he had caused her to laugh perhaps twice, and one of those was when he fell down the cellar stairs. He was a man with a great sense of humour while at the same time being in no way funny. Unlike Dexter: Dexter had no interest at all in jokes, probably thought that a sense of humour, like a political conscience, was a little embarrassing and un-cool, and yet with Dexter she laughed all the time, hysterically, sometimes, frankly, until she peed a little. On holiday in Greece, they had laughed for ten days straight, once they'd settled that little misunderstanding. Where was Dexter right now? she wondered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他不知不觉又绕到了段子上，爱玛的微笑僵在脸上。有一个事实如果直说，一定会伤透伊恩的心：自打认识他以来，他真正逗得她爆笑的总共大概只有两次，其中一次还是因为他从地下室的台阶上跌了下去。他是个幽默感很强的男人，却又一点也不好笑，不像德克斯特对笑话毫无兴趣，视幽默感如政治良知，尴尬而无趣，但反而会让她笑个没完，甚至歇斯底里，真得上趙厕所才止得住。希腊度假那次，那场小事故之后，他们整整十天笑了个够。他现在在哪里？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It's a big comprehensive in north London, teaching English and a bit of Drama. Nice school, really mixed, not one of those cushy suburban numbers where it's all yes-miss no-miss. So the kids are a bit of a challenge, but that's alright isn't it? That's what kids are meant to be. I say that now. They'll probably eat me alive, little sods." She rolled the brandy round the glass in a way that she'd seen in films. "I've got this vision of me sitting on the edge of the desk, talking about how Shakespeare was the first rapper or something, and all these kids are just gazing at me with their mouths open just -- hypnotised. I sort of imagine being carried aloft on inspired young shoulders. That's how I'm going to get around the school, the car park, the canteen, everywhere I go I'm going to be on the shoulders of adoring kids. One of those carpe diem teachers."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是伦敦北部的一个综合中学，我教英语和一点戏剧。是所好学校，真正的招生不论资质，不像社区里那些混日子的学校，所以面对孩子们是有挑战性的，不过问题不大，对吧？孩子就该如此嘛。瞧我现在说得轻松，到时非活活被他们吃掉，这帮小家伙。”她模仿着电影里摇白兰地杯子的样子。“我都能想见一幅画面，我就坐在讲台边缘，对他们说莎士比亚其实是第一位Rap艺人之类的， 让所有孩子瞠目结舌， 中了魔法一般。还有我被那些受鼓舞的青年人高高抬在肩上的情景，我的教学生活，是从停车场到餐厅，都被孩子们崇敬地扛在肩上。逍遥的麻辣教师。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">By the time the second brandies arrived there was no doubting that they were drunk. The whole restaurant seemed drunk, even the silver-haired pianist, clattering sloppily through "I Get a Kick Out of You", his foot pumping the sustain pedal as if someone had cut his brake cable. Forced to raise her voice, Emma could hear it echoing in her head as she spoke with great passion and force about her new career.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="白兰地再次送上来的时候，他们两个无疑都喝高了。整个餐厅的人似乎都喝高了，连那个银发的钢琴师也一样，拖泥带水地敲着键盘弹奏《我被你一脚踢开》，脚还跺着踏板，似乎在拼命地踩失效的刹车。爱玛不得不提高嗓门热情有力地谈起了新工作，她听见自己的声音在脑袋里回荡。">查看中文翻译</div>

"I think what it is is, if you're at school and you're not that bright or good-looking or popular or whatever, and one day you say something and someone laughs, well, you sort of grab onto it, don't you? You think, well I run funny and I've got this stupid big face and big thighs and no-one fancies me, but at least I can make people laugh. And it's such a nice feeling, making someone laugh, that maybe you get a bit reliant on it. Like, if you're not funny then you're not… anything."

<div class="line_en">At street level on the Cally Road, Ian's studio flat was lit only by the sodium of the street lamps and the occasional searchlight of the passing double-decker buses. Several times a minute the whole room vibrated, shaken by one or more of the Piccadilly, Victoria or Northern lines and buses 30, 10, 46, 214 and 390.
