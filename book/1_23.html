<div class="line_en">As she was looking out over the little bay, she remembered the time when as a little girl of six she had climbed up into the rowboat and rowed out into the bay alone. She had fallen overboard and it was all she could do to struggle ashore. Drenched to the skin, she had pushed her way through the thicket hedge. As she stood in the garden looking up at the house, her mother had come running toward her. The boat and both oars were left afloat in the bay. She still dreamed about the boat sometimes, drifting on its own, abandoned. It had been an embarrassing experience.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在，她俯视着那个小海湾，想起她还是个六岁的小女孩时，有一次曾经爬进那条小船，独自一人划到狭湾去。后来她掉到水里，勉强挣扎着上岸，然后浑身湿淋淋的穿过矮树篱；当她站在花园里仰望着她家的房子时，她妈妈跑过来了。那条小船和两支桨就一直在狭湾里漂浮着。如今她偶尔还会梦见小船空无一人、径自漂流的情景。那真是很令人难为情的一次经验。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The garden was neither especially luxuriant nor particularly well kept. But it was large and it was Hilde's. A weather-beaten apple tree and a few practically barren fruit bushes had just about survived the severe winter storms. The old glider stood on the lawn between granite rocks and thicket. It looked so forlorn in the sharp morning light. Even more so because the cushions had been taken in. Mom had probably hurried out late last night and rescued them from the rain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她家的这座园子花草既不特别繁茂，也没有经过刻意修整，但却相当宽敞。这是属于她的花园。园里那棵久经风霜的苹果树和几株光秃秃的灌木经过严寒的冬季暴风雪洗礼之后，仍然劲挺。在早晨明亮的阳光下，花岗岩与灌木丛之间的草坪上那座老旧的秋千显得分外孤零。秋千上的沙发垫子已经不见了。可能是昨天夜里妈妈匆匆跑出去收进来以免被雨淋湿。">查看中文翻译</div>

On the positive side, there were these soft curls. Lots of her friends struggled to get their hair to curl just a little bit, but Hilde's hair had always been naturally curly. Another positive feature, she thought, were her deep green eyes. "Are they really green?" her aunts and uncles used to say as they bent over to look at her.</div>

<div class="line_en">There was something about this old mirror that always made Hilde think of her father. It had once hung down in the "studio." The studio, over the boathouse, was her father's combined library, writer's workshop, and retreat. Albert, as Hilde called him when he was home, had always wanted to write something significant. Once he had tried to write a novel, but he never finished it. From time to time he had had a few poems and sketches of the archipelago published in a national journal. Hilde was so proud every time she saw his name in print. ALBERT KNAG. It meant something in Lillesan^, anyway. Her great-grandfather's name had also been Albert.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这面古老的镜子总是让席德想起她的父亲，因为它从前一度挂在“工作室”里。那间“工作室”就在船屋上面，是她父亲读书、写作、休息的地方。他一直希望能写一些有意义的东西。有一次他曾经试着写一本小说，却一直没有完成。他写的诗和他画的岛屿素描不时刊登在一家全国性期刊上。席德每次看到爸爸的名字“艾勃特”登出来，都觉得好骄傲。这样的事在黎乐桑还是不太常见的。">查看中文翻译</div>

We sense more of the unfathomable mystery in a butterfly that flutters from a twig -- or in a goldfish swimming in a bowl. But we are closest to God in our own soul. Only there can we become one with the greatest mystery of life. In truth, at very rare moments we can experience that we ourselves are that divine mystery.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="世间存在的每一样事物都有这种神秘的神圣之光。我们可以看到它在向日葵或罂粟花中闪烁着光芒。在一只飞离枝头的蝴蝶或在水缸中优游穿梭的金鱼身上，我们可以看到更多这种深不可测的神秘之光。然而，最靠近上帝的还是我们的灵魂。唯有在灵魂中，我们才能与生命的伟大与神秘合而为一。事实上，在某些很偶然的时刻中，我们可以体验到自我就是那神圣的神秘之光。">查看中文翻译</div>
