<div class="line_en">Everyone watched us as we walked together to our lab table. I noticed that he no longer angled the chair to sit as far from me as the desk would allow. Instead, he sat quite close beside me, our arms almost touching.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当我们一起走向我们的实验桌时，每个人都在看着我们。我注意到他再也没有坐到椅子一角上，在桌子允许的范围内尽可能的远离我。相反地，他紧紧地挨着我，我们的胳膊几乎要碰到一起了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And then, as the room went black, I was suddenly hyper aware that Edward was sitting less than an inch from me. I was stunned by the unexpected electricity that flowed through me, amazed that it was possible to be more aware of him than I already was. A crazy impulse to reach over and touch him, to stroke his perfect face just once in the darkness, nearly overwhelmed me. I crossed my arms tightly across my chest, my hands balling into fists. I was losing my mind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后，当教室里完全暗下来的时候，我忽然敏感地意识到了爱德华正坐在我身旁，不到一英寸的地方。我被一股意外地流过我全身的电流震住了，我发现自己可能比已经做到的还要更加强烈地意识到爱德华的存在，这让我很惊讶。一种疯狂的冲动——在黑暗中伸出手触碰他，去抚摸他完美的面孔，就这一次——几乎要征服了我。我紧紧地把胳膊交叉在胸前，我的手握成了拳。我快要发狂了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mr. Banner backed into the room then -- what superb timing the man had -- pulling a tall metal frame on wheels that held a heavy-looking, outdated TV and VCR. A movie day -- the lift in the class atmosphere was almost tangible.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后班纳老师回到了教室——这男人的时间感绝对是一流的——拉着一个高高的带轮子的金属架，上面放着一台看着很笨重的老式电视机和录像机。一次电影日——教室里的昂扬气氛几乎能摸得着了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The opening credits began, lighting the room by a token amount. My eyes, of their own accord, flickered to him. I smiled sheepishly as I realized his posture was identical to mine, fists clenched under his arms, right down to the eyes, peering sideways at me. He grinned back, his eyes somehow managing to smolder, even in the dark. I looked away before I could start hyperventilating. It was absolutely ridiculous that I should feel dizzy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="片头字幕开始了，微弱的光线象征性地照着屋子。我的眼睛，出于它们自己的意愿，飞快地向他一瞥。当我意识到他的姿势和我完全一样，也是在手臂下紧握着拳头，从眼皮底下，偷偷地瞄着我时，我羞怯地笑了。他向我咧嘴一笑，不知为何，他的眼睛在黑暗中压抑地燃烧着。在我气息不稳以前，我移开了视线。这实在太荒谬了，我居然感到头晕目眩。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The hour seemed very long. I couldn't concentrate on the movie -- I didn't even know what subject it was on. I tried unsuccessfully to relax, but the electric current that seemed to be originating from somewhere in his body never slackened. Occasionally I would permit myself a quick glance in his direction, but he never seemed to relax, either. The overpowering craving to touch him also refused to fade, and I crushed my fists safely against my ribs until my fingers were aching with the effort.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个小时过得非常漫长。我没法把注意力集中在电影上——我甚至不知道它的主旨是什么。我试图放松下来，但没有成功，那股电流似乎是从他身上的某个地方传来的，从未减缓过。偶尔我会允许自己飞快地瞥一眼他的方向，但他似乎也从未放松过。那种无法抵抗的，去触碰他的渴望同样不肯消失，我只得把自己的拳头安全地压在了手肘下，直到我的手指开始因为压力而刺痛起来为止。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I breathed a sigh of relief when Mr. Banner flicked the lights back on at the end of class, and stretched my arms out in front of me, flexing my stiff fingers. Edward chuckled beside me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当这堂课到达尾声，班纳老师把灯打开的时候，我松了一口气，宽慰地叹息着。我把胳膊向前伸去，活动着我僵直的手指。爱德华在我背后轻笑着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, that was interesting," he murmured. His voice was dark and his eyes were cautious.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他沉默地陪着我向下一堂课走去，然后停在了门外，我转身要说再见。他的脸把我吓了一跳——他的神情是全然的挣扎，几近痛苦，却又如此残酷的美丽。想要触碰他的渴望又熊熊燃烧起来，和之前一样强烈。我的再见卡在了喉咙里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I walked into the gym, lightheaded and wobbly. I drifted to the locker room, changing in a trance like state, only vaguely aware that there were other people surrounding me. Reality didn't fully set in until I was handed a racket. It wasn't heavy, yet it felt very unsafe in my hand. I could see a few of the other kids in class eyeing me furtively. Coach Clapp ordered us to pair up into teams.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我头晕眼花，脚步不稳地走进体育馆。我游魂似的走进更衣室，在神思恍惚中换了衣服，只能模糊地意识到我周围还有别的人。直到我拿起球拍，真实感才完全回到了我的神智中。球拍不算很沉，但在我手里显得很不安全。我能看到班里的一些别的孩子在偷偷地瞄着我。克拉普教练让我们自己组队。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He raised his hand, hesitant, conflict raging in his eyes, and then swiftly brushed the length of my cheekbone with his fingertips. His skin was as icy as ever, but the trail his fingers left on my skin was alarmingly warm -- like I'd been burned, but didn't feel the pain of it yet.</div>

<div class="line_en">"You and Cullen, huh?" he asked, his tone rebellious. My previous feeling of affection disappeared.</div>

<div class="line_en">It didn't go smoothly. I somehow managed to hit myself in the head with my racket and clip Mike's shoulder on the same swing. I spent the rest of the hour in the back corner of the court, the racket held safely behind my back. Despite being handicapped by me, Mike was pretty good; he won three games out of four singlehandedly. He gave me an unearned high five when the coach finally blew the whistle ending class.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="情况没那么顺利。我在原因不明的情况下成功地击中了自己的头部，而且在同一次挥拍打中了迈克的肩膀。这个小时剩下的时间里，我始终待在庭院的后角里，球拍被安全地握在了我的背后。尽管由于我的存在而有些吃亏，但迈克还是干得很漂亮：他独力赢得了四场比赛里的三场。当克拉普教练最终吹响了哨子，宣布下课时，他让我不劳而获地拿到了五分的高分。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I dressed quickly, something stronger than butterflies battering recklessly against the walls of my stomach, my argument with Mike already a distant memory. I was wondering if Edward would be waiting, or if I should meet him at his car. What if his family was there? I felt a wave of real terror. Did they know that I knew? Was I supposed to know that they knew that I knew, or not?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我飞快地换上衣服，某种比蝴蝶更加有力的东西在不顾一切地猛击着我的胃壁，我和迈克的争论已经成为了久远的回忆。我想知道爱德华是否在等着，又或者我得在他的车那里和他碰头。如果他的家人也在那里，我该怎么办？我感到一阵真切的恐惧。他们知道我知道了吗？又或者，我能获准知道他们知道我知道了吗？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="之后，我不安地赶去换衣服，知道我的动作越快，我就能越早和爱德华待在一起。这种压迫感使得我比平时还有笨手笨脚，但最终我冲出门口，和上次一样宽慰地看到他站在那里，一个大大的笑容下意识地浮现在我脸上。作为回应，他微笑起来，然后开始新一轮狂热的交互讯问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His questions were different now, though, not as easily answered. He wanted to know what I missed about home, insisting on descriptions of anything he wasn't familiar with. We sat in front of Charlie's house for hours, as the sky darkened and rain plummeted around us in a sudden deluge.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，他现在的问题变得不一样了，不再那么容易回答了。他想知道我想念着家里的什么事物，坚持要我描述出任何他不熟悉的部分。我们坐在查理的房子前，坐了好几个小时，直到天黑下来，骤然泛滥的雨水笔直地落在我们周围。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I tried to describe impossible things like the scent of creosote -- bitter, slightly resinous, but still pleasant -- the high, keening sound of the cicadas in July, the feathery barrenness of the trees, the very size of the sky, extending white-blue from horizon to horizon, barely interrupted by the low mountains covered with purple volcanic rock. The hardest thing to explain was why it was so beautiful to me -- to justify a beauty that didn't depend on the sparse, spiny vegetation that often looked half dead, a beauty that had more to do with the exposed shape of the land, with the shallow bowls of valleys between the craggy hills, and the way they held on to the sun. I found myself using my hands as I tried to describe it to him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我试图描述出一些根本没法形容的食物，像是木馏油的香味——发苦的，有点像树脂，但还是很亲切——七月里尖锐凄厉的蝉鸣，柔软如鸿毛的无叶树（仙人掌），广阔无垠的天空，那种发白的蓝色从一侧的地平线一直延伸到另一侧的地平线，极少被覆满了紫色火山岩的低矮的山丘阻断。最难解释的事情是为什么我会觉得它们如此美丽——定义一种并非基于稀稀落落的，多刺的，经常看上去半死不活的植被的美丽，一种与大地裸路的形状，与崎岖的山谷间浅浅的有如碗状的山谷，与他们在太阳底下绵延的方式毫无关系的美丽。当我努力向他解释时，我发现自己常常得用上手势。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Charlie!" I suddenly recalled his existence, and sighed. I looked out at the rain-darkened sky, but it gave nothing away. "How late is it?" I wondered out loud as I glanced at the clock. I was surprised by the time -- Charlie would be driving home now.</div>

<div class="line_en">"It's the safest time of day for us," he said, answering the unspoken question in my eyes. "The easiest time. But also the saddest, in a way… the end of another day, the return of the night. Darkness is so predictable, don't you think?" He smiled wistfully.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“对我们来说，这是一天之中最安全的时候。”他说道，回答了我眼中未说出口的疑问。“最容易的时刻。但从某种意义上说，也是最伤感的…又一天的结束，夜晚再度降临。黑暗如此容易预测，你不这样认为吗？”他想望地微笑着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jacob was already climbing out, his wide grin visible even through the darkness. In the passenger seat was a much older man, a heavyset man with a memorable face -- a face that overflowed, the cheeks resting against his shoulders, with creases running through the russet skin like an old leather jacket. And the surprisingly familiar eyes, black eyes that seemed at the same time both too young and too ancient for the broad face they were set in. Jacob's father, Billy Black. I knew him immediately, though in the more than five years since I'd seen him last I'd managed to forget his name when Charlie had spoken of him my first day here. He was staring at me, scrutinizing my face, so I smiled tentatively at him. His eyes were wide, as if in shock or fear, his nostrils flared. My smile faded.</div>
