<div class="line_en">Kate, 40, a blond, stern-faced quality-control manager for a large corporation, came to see me at the recommendation of her family physician. She had been having panic attacks in her car and in the elevator of the building where she worked. Her physician had prescribed tranquilizers but was concerned about Kate's aversion to leaving her apartment except to go to work. He urged her to seek psychological help.</div>

<div class="line_en">I find I get angry at myself all the time, and sometimes I cry for no reason at all. It's probably my frustration at myself. I keep thinking how my parents hurt and humiliated me. I don't keep friends for very long. I have a pattern of cutting off whole groups of friends at a time. I guess I don't want them to find out how bad I am.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The first thing I noticed about Kate was that her severe, unhappy expression seemed molded onto her face -- as if she had never learned to smile. It didn't take me long to discover why:</div>

<div class="line_en">I was raised in an upper-class suburb outside St. Louis. We had everything money could buy. From the outside we looked like this perfect family. But from the inside… my father would go into these crazy rages. They usually came after he had a fight with my mother. He would just turn on whichever of us was closest. He would take off his belt and start strapping me or my sister… across our legs… on our heads… anywhere he could hit us. When he'd start in, I'd always have this fear that he wouldn't stop.</div>

<div class="line_en">Inside millions of American households, ranging across all social, economic, and educational lines, a terrible crime is being committed every day -- the physical abuse of children.</div>

<div class="line_en">Today our norms have narrowed. The problem of physical child abuse has become so widespread that public recognition has forced our legal system to set limits on physical discipline. In an attempt to clarify what constitutes physical abuse, Congress enacted the Federal Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act of 1974. This act defined physical abuse as: "the infliction of physical injuries such as bruises, burns, welts, cuts, bone and skull fractures; these are caused by kicking, punching, biting, beating, knifing, strapping, paddling, etc." How this definition translates into law is often a matter of interpretation. Every state has its own child-abuse laws, and most embody definitions similar to the federal one, which is somewhat vague in its scope. A child with a broken bone has clearly been abused, but most prosecutors would be reluctant to press charges against a parent who had bruised a child during a spanking.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There is a great deal of controversy and confusion over the definition of physical abuse. Many people still believe that parents have not only the right but the responsibility to use corporal punishment on their children. The most common parenting motto in the English language is still, "Spare the rod and spoil the child." Until recently, children had virtually no legal rights. They were widely viewed as chattel, pieces of property that were "owned" by their parents. For hundreds of years, parental rights were considered inviolate -- in the name of discipline, parents could do just about anything to their children, short of killing them.</div>

</div>
<div class="line_en">I'm not a lawyer and I'm not a cop, but for more than twenty years I've seen the suffering that "legal" corporal punishment can create. I have my own definition of physical abuse: any behavior that inflicts significant physical pain on a child, regardless of whether it leaves marks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Most of us who have children have felt the urge to strike them at one time or another. These feelings can be especially strong when a child won't stop crying, nagging, or defying us. Sometimes it has less to do with a child's behavior than with our own exhaustion, stress level, anxiety, or unhappiness. A lot of us manage to resist the impulse to hit our children. Unfortunately, many parents are not so restrained.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We can only speculate why, but physically abusive parents seem to share certain characteristics. First, they have an appalling lack of impulse control. Physically abusive parents will assault their children whenever they have strong negative feelings that they need to discharge. These parents seem to have little, if any, awareness of the consequences of what they are doing to their children. It is almost an automatic reaction to stress. The impulse and the action are one and the same.</div>

</div>
<div class="line_en">Physical abusers themselves often come from families in which abuse was the norm. Much of their adult behavior is a direct repetition of what they experienced and learned in their youth. Their role model was an abuser. Violence was the only tool they learned to use in dealing with problems and feelings -- especially feelings of anger.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Many physically abusive parents enter adulthood with tremendous emotional deficits and unmet needs. Emotionally, they are still children. They often look upon their own children as surrogate parents, to fulfill the emotional needs that their real parents never fulfilled. The abuser becomes enraged when his child can't meet his needs. He lashes out. At that moment, the child is more of a surrogate parent than ever, because it is the abuser's parent at whom the abuser is truly enraged.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Many of these parents also have problems with alcohol or drugs. Substance abuse is a frequent contributor to the breakdown of impulse control, though by no means is it the only one.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There are many types of physical abusers, but at the darkest end of the spectrum are those who have children seemingly for the sole purpose of brutalizing them. Many of these people look, talk, and act just like human beings, but they are monsters -- totally devoid of the feelings and characteristics that give most of us our humanity. These people defy comprehension; there is no logic to their behavior.</div>

<div class="line_en">Kate's father was a well-respected banker, a churchgoer, a family man -- hardly the type most people would imagine when they hear the phrase child abuser. But Kate didn't live in an imagined reality, she lived in a real nightmare.</div>

<div class="line_en">My sister and I started locking our door at night because we were so scared. I'll never forget this one time when I was eleven… she was nine. We were hiding under our beds and he kept banging on the door. I've never been so scared in my life. Then, all of a sudden he came crashing through the door like in the movies. It was terrifying. The door just flew into the room. We tried to run, but he grabbed us both and threw us in the corner and started beating at us with his belt. He kept shouting, "I'll kill you if you ever lock me out again!" I thought he was going to kill us right then and there.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The climate of terror that Kate described permeates the homes of physically abused children. Even in quiet moments, these children live in fear that the volcano of rage will erupt at any moment. And when it does, anything the victim does to fend off the blows only outrages the abuser more. Kate's desperate attempts to protect herself by hiding under her bed and locking the door only intensified her father's irrational behavior. There is no safe place to hide, no escape from the abuser, no protector to run to.</div>

<div class="line_en">I was always getting knocked around in my bedroom, I don't even remember what for. I could be doing anything and my father would burst in and start screaming and yelling at the top of his lungs. The next thing I knew, he'd start punching me until he'd have me up against the wall. He'd keep pounding me so hard that I'd be dazed and didn't know what the hell was going on anymore. The scariest part of it was not ever knowing what would provoke his outbursts!</div>

<div class="line_en">I first met Joe, 27, at a seminar I was conducting at a graduate school of psychology where he was studying for his master's degree. I mentioned in my presentation that I was writing a book on toxic parents. Joe sought me out at the lunch break and volunteered to be a case study for my book. I had more than enough material from my practice, but something in this young man's voice told me he needed to talk to someone. We met the following day and talked for several hours. I was impressed not only by his openness and candor but by the sincerity of his desire to use his painful experiences to help others.</div>

<div class="line_en">It just doesn't go away because you move out or get married. I'm always afraid of something, and I hate myself for it. But if your father, who is supposed to love you and take care of you, treated you this way, then what the hell is going to happen to you in the real world. I've screwed up a lot of relationships because I can't let anyone get too close. I'm so ashamed of myself for that, and I'm so ashamed of myself for being so damn frightened all the time. But life just scares the hell out of me. I'm really working hard in my own therapy to get on top of this stuff because I know I'm not going to be of much use to myself or anybody else until I do. But, holy Christ, it's a struggle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Joe spent much of his childhood waiting for the tidal wave of his father's rage and knowing there was no way to avoid it. The experience generated powerful, lifelong fears of being hurt and betrayed. Two marriages ended in divorce because he couldn't learn to trust.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It is tremendously difficult to regain feelings of trust and safety once they have been trampled by parents. All of us develop our expectations about how people will treat us based on our relationships with our parents. If those relationships are, for the most part, emotionally nourishing, respectful of our rights and feelings, we'll grow up expecting others to treat us in much the same way. These positive expectations allow us to be relatively vulnerable and open in our adult relationships. But if, as in Joe's case, childhood is a time of unrelenting anxiety, tension, and pain, then we develop negative expectations and rigid defenses.</div>

<div class="line_en">I remember one particularly terrible evening after dinner when my mother was out shopping. My father was really giving it to me with that damned belt. I was screaming so loud that one of our neighbors called the police, but my father managed to convince them that everything was fine. He told the cops that the noise was coming from the TV, and they bought it. I'm standing there with tears streaming down my face and welts on my arms, but they still bought it. Why shouldn't they? My father was one of the most powerful men in the city. But at least they calmed him down. After they left, he told me he'd been under a lot of stress lately. I didn't even know what stress meant, but he really wanted me to understand what he was going through. He told me that my mother wasn't nice to him anymore… that she wouldn't sleep with him and it wasn't right for a wife not to sleep with her husband. That was why he was so upset all the time.</div>

<div class="line_en">Joe expected the worst of others. He expected to be hurt and mistreated as he was in his childhood. So he encased himself in a suit of emotional armor.

<div class="line_en">Kate's father revealed inappropriate, intimate information to a child who was too young to understand. Yet, he expected her to nurture him emotionally. This role reversal confused and bewildered Kate, but it is common among abusive parents. They want their children to give them both relief and absolution; they batter them, then they blame their behavior on someone else.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Instead of dealing directly with his marital problems, Kate's father displaced his fury and sexual frustration onto his daughters, then rationalized his violence by blaming his wife. Physical violence against children is often a reaction to stress at work, conflict with another family member or friend, or general tension over an unsatisfying life. Children are easy targets: they can't fight back, and they can be intimidated into silence. Unfortunately for both the abuser and the victim, displacing anger gives the abuser only temporary relief. The true source of his rage remains, unchanged and destined to build up again. And, sadly, the helpless target of his rage remains as well, destined to soak up that rage and carry it into adulthood.</div>

<div class="line_en">Other abusers, instead of blaming someone else for their behavior, will try to justify it as being in the child's best interests. Many parents still believe that physical punishment is the only effective way to drive home a moral or behavioral point. Many of these "lessons" are delivered in the name of religion. Never has a book been as sorely misused as the Bible to justify beatings.</div>

<div class="line_en">I was disappointed in your response to the girl whose mother used to strap her. The gym teacher noticed the bruises on her legs and backside and called it "child abuse." Why are you against strapping a child when the Bible tells us in plain language that this is what parents should do? Proverbs 23:13 says: "Withhold not correction from the child for if thou beatest him with the rod, he shall not die." Proverbs 23:14 says: "Thou shalt beat him with the rod and shalt deliver his soul from death."</div>

<div class="line_en">My dad's mother died when my dad was fourteen. He never got over it. He's still not over it, and he's going on sixty-four. He recently told me that he was tough on me because he didn't want me to feel. Sick as it was, he theorized that if you don't feel, you won't have to go through the pain of life. I honest-to-God believe he thought he was protecting me from being hurt. He didn't want me to experience the kind of pain he'd gone through with his mother's death.</div>

<div class="line_en">Instead of making Joe tougher or less vulnerable, the beatings left him fearful and mistrustful, far less equipped to make it in the world. It's absurd to believe that severe physical punishment will have any positive effects on a child.</div>

<div class="line_en">In fact, research indicates that physical discipline is not particularly effective as a punishment even for specific undesirable behaviors. Beatings have proved to be only temporary deterrents, and they create in children strong feelings of rage, revenge fantasies, and self-hatred. It's quite clear that the mental, emotional, and often bodily harm caused by physical abuse far outweighs any momentary advantages.</div>

<div class="line_en">So far I have focused almost entirely on the actively abusive parent. But there's another player in the family drama who must share some of the responsibility.

<div class="line_en">Joe's mother did not beat her children herself, but because she did not protect them from her husband's brutality she became a partner in their abuse.

<div class="line_en">I remember when I was about ten years old, and my dad had beaten the hell out of my mother one night.

<div class="line_en">In both Kate's and Joe's cases, the father was the active abuser and the mother was the silent partner. However, this is by no means the only family scenario. In some families, the mother is the active abuser and the father is the passive one. The sexes may change, but the dynamics of passive abuse remain the same. I have had clients where both parents were abusive, but the abusive/passive parent combination is far more common.</div>

<div class="line_en">No matter how many times I hear statements like, "I guess she couldn't help it," they still upset me. Kate's mother could have helped it.

Her mother should have stood up to Kate's father, or, if she was afraid of him, she should have called the police. There is no excuse for a parent to stand by and allow his or her children to be brutalized.</div>

<div class="line_en">For Terry, a 43-year-old marketing rep, the situation was further confused when his passive parent became the sympathetic comforter. Terry, who had been physically abused by his mother through most of his childhood, idolized his ineffectual father.</div>

<div class="line_en">I was a very sensitive kid, more into art and music than sports. My mother always called me a sissy. She got angry with me a lot and would beat me with anything she could find. It seems like I spent most of my childhood hiding in closets. I was never sure why she beat me so much, but everything I did seemed to piss her off. I feel like she wiped out my whole childhood.</div>

<div class="line_en">Many adult children excuse the passive parent because they see that parent as a co-victim. In Joe's case, this view was intensified because he was in a role reversal in which he felt protective of his passive mother.</div>

<div class="line_en">Lots of times, my dad would hold me while I was sobbing, and he'd tell me how sorry he was about my mother's fits.

He gave me the only real consistent love I got when I was little.</div>

Just as he clung to his father's tenderness as a frightened child, so was he clinging to it today as a frightened adult. In trading a dark closet for a false reality, he had done nothing to face the truth.</div>

<div class="line_en">Terry was aware of how much his mother's abuse had colored his life but far less aware of how much repressed rage he carried toward his father.

<div class="line_en">The seeds of self-blame were planted early in Joe. How could a small child withstand this powerful propaganda about his worth? Like all abused children, Joe believed two lies: that he was bad, and that he was getting beaten only because he was bad.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Since these lies came from his powerful, all-knowing father, they had to be true. These lies remain unchallenged for most adults who were battered as children, including Joe. As he describes it:</div>

<div class="line_en">All my life, it's been going through my mind that I don't deserve to be happy. I think that's why I never got married… never had a good relationship… never allowed myself any real success.</div>

<div class="line_en">Kate expressed a similar theme when she didn't want people to find out how "bad" she was.

<div class="line_en">At times my father could be funny, and sometimes, I swear, he was even gentle. Like this one time I was signed up for this big skiing competition and he got really into it. So he drove me all the way to Jackson, Wyoming, which took ten hours, just so I could practice on good snow. On the way home, Dad told me I was really special. Of course, while he's saying it, I'm thinking, "If I'm so special, why do I feel so lousy about myself?" But he said it. That's what counts. I'm still trying to recapture with him what we had that day.</div>

</div>
<div class="line_en">The mixed messages only added to Joe's confusion, and they made it more difficult for him to face the truth about his father. I explained to Joe that an incredibly strong, perverse parent/child fusion occurs when a parent holds out a promise of love while at the same time mistreating that child. A child's world is very narrow, and no matter how abusive, the parents still represent the only available source of love and comfort. The battered child spends his entire childhood searching for the Holy Grail of parental love. That search continues into adulthood.</div>

<div class="line_en">Her father's sporadic benevolence kept Kate yearning for his love, hoping for a turnaround. This hope kept her bonded to him long after she reached adulthood. As part of that bonding, she believed she had to keep secret the truth of her father's behavior. A "good" girl would never betray her family.</div>

How do you get over the pain of something if you can't talk about it? Sure, I can talk about it in therapy, but I still can't talk about it to the people who held all this power over me all those years. The only person I could ever talk about it with was the maid. I felt she was the only person in the world I could trust. Once, after my dad beat me, she said, "Honey, your dad's very sick."

I was at my high school reunion a few years ago and I felt so hypocritical. My classmates all thought I had such a great family. I thought, "If they only knew." I wish I could tell my parents how they ruined my high school years. I want to scream at them that they hurt me so much I can't love anyone. I can't have a loving relationship with a man.

Many abusive families are able to present a very "normal" facade to the rest of the world. This apparent respectability is in direct opposition to the family's reality. It forms the basis of a "family myth." Joe's family myth was typical:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It's such a goddamned farce whenever I get together with my family. Nothing's changed. My father still drinks, and I'm sure he's still hitting my mother. But from the way we all act and talk, you'd think we were Leave It to Beaver. Am I the only one who remembers what it was like? Am I the only one who knows the truth? It doesn't really matter because I never say anything anyway. I'm just as phony as the rest of them. I guess I can't let go of the hope that maybe someday things will be different. Maybe if we pretend hard enough, we will be a normal family.</div>

But if they had read his pleas and hadn't responded emotionally, he would had to have given up his fantasy that some miracle might someday give him the key to their love.

<div class="line_en">In some cases, the abused child unconsciously identifies with his abusive parent. After all, the abuser looks powerful and invulnerable. Victimized children fantasize that if they possessed these qualities, they would be able to protect themselves. So, as an unconscious defense, they develop some of the very personality traits that they most hate in their toxic parent. Despite fervent promises to themselves to be different, under stress they may behave exactly like their abusers. But this syndrome is not as widespread as most people assume.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For many years it was commonly believed that almost all battered children became battering parents. After all, this was the only role model they'd had. But current studies challenge these assumptions. In fact, not only have a good many formerly abused children grown into nonabusing adults, but a number of these parents have great difficulty with even modest, nonphysical methods of disciplining their children. In rebellion against the pain of their own childhoods, these parents shy away both from setting limits and from enforcing them. This, too, can have a negative impact on a child's development, because children need the security of boundaries. But the harm done by overpermissiveness is usually far less significant than the damage done by a batterer.</div>
