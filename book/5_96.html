<div class="line_en">In the front seat, Dad leaned forward and turned on the radio. John Denver's voice floated through the speakers with "Thank God I'm a Country Boy." "That's all I'm singing, Margie. If they don't want to join in… fine."</div>

<div class="line_en">The drive home from British Columbia seemed to take forever. The air conditioner in the station wagon was broken, so warm air tumbled from the useless vents. Everyone was hot and tired and dirty. And still Mom and Dad wanted to sing songs. They kept bugging the kids to sing along.</div>

<div class="line_en">They piled out of the smelly station wagon and began the end-of-vacation ritual. By the time they finished, it was dark. Kate put the last of her clothes into the pile on the laundry room floor, started the first load, then went to find her mom, who was sitting on the sofa with Dad.

<div class="line_en">For almost four hours Tully stood at the corner of her house, watching the Mularkeys unload their car. She'd thought about running up the hill a dozen times, just showing up, but she wasn't ready for the boisterousness of the whole family just yet. She wanted to be alone with Kate, someplace quiet where they could talk.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="塔莉站在对面屋角将近四个小时，看着穆勒齐一家人搬行李。她好几次想跑上山丘惊喜亮相，但她还没准备好接受整家人的热情欢乐。她想和凯蒂单独找个安静的地方谈心。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So she waited until the lights went out and then crossed the street. In the grass beneath Kate's window, she waited another thirty minutes, just to be sure.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她等到灯光全暗了才过马路，在凯蒂窗户下面的草地上又等了半个小时以防万一。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I know, girl," Tully said, sitting down. She wrapped her arms around her bent legs, hugging herself. Maybe she should have called instead of stalking them like this. But Mrs. Mularkey might have told her to come by tomorrow, that they were tired from their long drive, and Tully couldn't wait anymore. This loneliness was more than she could handle by herself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我懂，乖马儿。”塔莉坐下，屈膝抱着双腿，整个人缩成一团。或许她该先打个电话，而不是这样偷偷摸摸。可是穆勒齐伯母可能会说他们长途开车很累了，要她明天再来，但她实在不能等了，她没有能力独自应付这样的寂寞。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Finally, at eleven o'clock, she stood up, brushed the grass off her jeans, and threw a piece of gravel at Kate's window.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="十一点时，她终于站起身，拍掉牛仔裤上的草，捡起一块石头扔向凯蒂的窗户。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Off to her left somewhere, she could hear Sweetpea nickering at her and pawing at the ground. No doubt the old mare was looking for company, too. During the camping trip a neighbor had fed the horse, but that wasn't the same as being loved.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="左边传来甜豆的声音，它刨着地对她嘶鸣，显然这匹老母马也希望有人做伴。他们一家去露营时拜托邻居帮忙喂马，但它需要被爱的感觉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It took four tosses before her friend stuck her head out the window. "Tully!" Kate ducked back into her room and slammed the window shut. It took less than a minute for her to appear at the side of the house. Wearing a Bionic Woman nightshirt, her old black-rimmed glasses, and her retainer, Kate ran for Tully, arms outstretched.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="丢到第四颗好友才终于开窗探头，“塔莉！”凯蒂缩回房间，急忙关上窗户，不到一分钟她就出现在屋侧，身上穿着影集《无敌女金刚》图案的长版T恤睡衣，戴着黑框旧眼镜和牙齿维持器。凯蒂大大张开双手奔向塔莉。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Tully couldn't answer. It was all she could do not to cry. She wondered if Kate knew, really knew, how important their friendship was to her. "I got our bikes," she said, stepping back, looking away so Kate wouldn't see her moist eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="塔莉无法回答，光是忍住不哭就够难了。她纳闷凯蒂究竟是否明白这段友谊对她有多重要。“我把脚踏车带来了。”她后退，转开视线，以免凯蒂发现她眼眶泛泪。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Within minutes they were on their way, flying down Summer Hill, their hands outstretched to catch the wind. At the bottom of the hill, they ditched their bikes in the trees and walked down the long and winding road to the river. All around them trees chattered among themselves; the wind sighed, and leaves fluttered down from branches in an early sign of the coming autumn.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不到几分钟她们就出发了，俯冲飞过夏季丘，张开双手捕捉风。到了坡底，她们将脚踏车放在树下，漫步走过蜿蜒长路到河边。四周的树木窸窣聊着天，风儿叹息，树叶颤抖着由枝头落下，昭告早秋的来临。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Kate flopped down in their old spot, her back rested against the mossy log, her feet stretched out in the grass that had grown tall in their absence.</div>

<div class="line_en">Tully felt an unexpected pinch of nostalgia for their youth. They'd spent most of one summer here, taking their separate, lonely lives and braiding them into a rope of friendship. She lay down beside Kate, scooting close enough that their shoulders were touching. After the last few days, she needed to know that her best friend was finally beside her. She positioned her transistor radio nearby and turned up the volume.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="塔莉莫名缅怀起她们的年少时光。那年夏天她们几乎天天都来，以各自的寂寞人生编织出友谊。她在凯蒂身边躺下挨近，急切地让两人肩并着肩，过去几天实在太难熬，她需要确认好友真的在身边。她将收音机放在旁边，转大音量。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And there it was, what Tully had been waiting for all week. Someone who loved her and was truly sorry for her. Tears stung her eyes; before she knew it, she was crying.

<div class="line_en">"I am, though."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不过我真的觉得很遗憾。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tully wiped her eyes and reached into her pocket, pulling out a pack of cigarettes. Lighting one up, she took a drag and coughed. It had been years since she'd smoked. "I have to go into foster care. It's only for a while, though. When I'm eighteen I can live alone."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="塔莉抹去泪水，从口袋中拿出一包烟，点起一支吸了一大口，立刻呛咳起来。她好几年没抽烟了，“我得去寄养家庭，不过只会待一小段时间，一满十八岁我就可以独立生活了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I know." Tully lay back against the log and stared up at the night sky. She wanted to admit that she was scared and that as alone as she'd sometimes felt in life, she knew now what real loneliness was, but she couldn't say the words, not even to Kate. Thoughts -- even fears -- were airy things, formless until you made them solid with your voice, and once given that weight, they could crush you.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我知道。”塔莉往后靠在朽木上仰望夜空。她想承认自己很害怕，虽然她不时在人生中感到孤独，但现在才明白真正孑然一身的滋味，然而她说不出口，就算对方是凯蒂也一样。思绪，甚至恐惧，都是缥缈无形之物，一旦说出来便会赋予实体，而那份重量能够将人压垮。">查看中文翻译</div>

She'd think about the mother who'd so often and so repeatedly abandoned her, and the strangers with whom she'd soon live, and the grandmother who was gone. "We won't get caught. I promise."
