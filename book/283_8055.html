<div class="line_en">It may be possible to do without dancing entirely. Instances have been known of young people passing many, many months successively, without being at any ball of any description, and no material injury accrue either to body or mind; -- but when a beginning is made -- when the felicities of rapid motion have once been, though slightly, felt-it must be a very heavy set that does not ask for more.</div>

<div class="line_en">Frank Churchill had danced once at Highbury, and longed to dance again; and the last half-hour of an evening which Mr. Woodhouse was persuaded to spend with his daughter at Randalls, was passed by the two young people in schemes on the subject. Frank's was the first idea; and his the greatest zeal in pursuing it; for the lady was the best judge of the difficulties, and the most solicitous for accommodation and appearance. But still she had inclination enough for shewing people again how delightfully Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse danced-for doing that in which she need not blush to compare herself with Jane Fairfax-and even for simple dancing itself, without any of the wicked aids of vanity-to assist him first in pacing out the room they were in to see what it could be made to hold-and then in taking the dimensions of the other parlour, in the hope of discovering, in spite of all that Mr. Weston could say of their exactly equal size, that it was a little the largest.</div>

<div class="line_en">The doors of the two rooms were just opposite each other. "Might not they use both rooms, and dance across the passage?" It seemed the best scheme; and yet it was not so good but that many of them wanted a better. Emma said it would be awkward; Mrs. Weston was in distress about the supper; and Mr. Woodhouse opposed it earnestly, on the score of health. It made him so very unhappy, indeed, that it could not be persevered in.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两个房间正好门对门。“可不可以两间都用上，穿过走廊来回跳呢？”这似乎是个最好的主意，然而好几个人又不大满意，还找个更好的办法。爱玛这太不方便了。韦斯顿太太为晚饭发愁。伍德豪斯先生从健康的角度考虑，坚决表示反对。他心里老大不高兴，别人也不便再坚持了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Somebody said that Miss Gilbert was expected at her brother's, and must be invited with the rest. Somebody else believed Mrs. Gilbert would have danced the other evening, if she had been asked. A word was put in for a second young Cox; and at last, Mr. Weston naming one family of cousins who must be included, and another of very old acquaintance who could not be left out, it became a certainty that the five couple would be at least ten, and a very interesting speculation in what possible manner they could be disposed of.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有人说吉尔伯特小姐可能在她哥哥家，也得把她一起请来。还有个人，那天晚上要是请上吉尔伯特太太的话，她也会跳舞的。不知什么人为考克斯家的小儿子说了句话。最后，韦斯顿太太又提到一家表亲，这家人一定要请上，还提到一位老朋友，说他们家也不能落掉。这样一来，五对舞伴至少要变成十对，他们兴趣盎然地猜测怎样才能安排得下。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh! no," said he; "it would be the extreme of imprudence. I could not bear it for Emma! -- Emma is not strong. She would catch a dreadful cold. So would poor little Harriet.

Do not tell his father, but that young man is not quite the thing. He has been opening the doors very often this evening, and keeping them open very inconsiderately. He does not think of the draught. I do not mean to set you against him, but indeed he is not quite the thing!"</div>

<div class="line_en">Mrs. Weston was sorry for such a charge. She knew the importance of it, and said every thing in her power to do it away. Every door was now closed, the passage plan given up, and the first scheme of dancing only in the room they were in resorted to again; and with such good-will on Frank Churchill's part, that the space which a quarter of an hour before had been deemed barely sufficient for five couple, was now endeavoured to be made out quite enough for ten.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Aye, very true. Mr. Perry did say so. I shall never forget it. Poor little Emma! You were very bad with the measles; that is, you would have been very bad, but for Perry's great attention. He came four times a day for a week. He said, from the first, it was a very good sort-which was our great comfort; but the measles are a dreadful complaint. I hope whenever poor Isabella's little ones have the measles, she will send for Perry."</div>

<div class="line_en">One perplexity, however, arose, which the gentlemen did not disdain. It regarded a supper-room. At the time of the ballroom's being built, suppers had not been in question; and a small card-room adjoining, was the only addition. What was to be done? This card-room would be wanted as a card-room now; or, if cards were conveniently voted unnecessary by their four selves, still was it not too small for any comfortable supper? Another room of much better size might be secured for the purpose; but it was at the other end of the house, and a long awkward passage must be gone through to get at it. This made a difficulty. Mrs. Weston was afraid of draughts for the young people in that passage; and neither Emma nor the gentlemen could tolerate the prospect of being miserably crowded at supper.</div>

All the rest, in speculation at least, was perfectly smooth. All the minor arrangements of table and chair, lights and music, tea and supper, made themselves; or were left as mere trifles to be settled at any time between Mrs. Weston and Mrs. Stokes. -- Every body invited, was certainly to come; Frank had already written to Enscombe to propose staying a few days beyond his fortnight, which could not possibly be refused.
