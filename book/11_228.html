<div class="line_en">"Rewards!" said Frodo. "I can't imagine a more severe punishment. You are not thinking what you are saying: condemned to go on this hopeless journey, a reward? Yesterday I dreamed that my task was done, and I could rest here, a long while, perhaps for good."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“奖励！”佛罗多大惑不解地回答：“我实在没办法想像比这个还要严厉的惩罚了。你一定又没有动脑想了；注定绝望的旅程，这算是奖励？我昨天还梦到我的工作终于结束，可以永远在这边休息了哩。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I don't wonder," said Merry, "and I wish you could. But we are envying Sam, not you. If you have to go, then it will be a punishment for any of us to be left behind, even in Rivendell. We have come a long way with you and been through some stiff times. We want to go on."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这也难怪，”梅里说：“我也希望你可以，但我们羡慕的是山姆，而不是你。如果你决定要去，对我们来说，即使是留在瑞文戴尔，也都是最严厉的惩罚，我们和你同生共死了这么长一段时间，我们想要继续下去。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You were wrong," said Gandalf. "You were inattentive. I had already heard of it from Gwaihir. If you want to know, the only real eye-openers, as you put it, were you and Frodo; and I was the only one that was not surprised."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你猜错了，”甘道夫说：“你那个时候不专心。我已经从关赫口中听到了这个消息。如果你真的想要知道，真正让人大吃一惊的是你和佛罗多，我可是唯一幸免于难的老家伙哪。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, anyway," said Bilbo, "nothing was decided beyond choosing poor Frodo and Sam. I was afraid all the time that it might come to that, if I was let off. But if you ask me, Elrond will send out a fair number, when the reports come in. Have they started yet, Gandalf?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好吧，总之，”比尔博说：“除了会有可怜的佛罗多和山姆之外，其他一切都还没有决定。如果不是我坚持的话，恐怕连这个结果都无法达成。不过，如果你问我的意见，我会猜爱隆等到情报回来之后，会派出不少人。甘道夫，他们出发了吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Talking," said Bilbo. "There was a deal of talk, and everyone had an eye-opener. Even old Gandalf. I think Legolas's bit of news about Gollum caught even him on the hop, though he passed it off."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“就是讲话而已，”比尔博说：“我们讲了很多话，每个人都有自己让人惊讶的故事，连老甘道夫都不例外。我猜勒苟拉斯有关咕鲁逃跑的消息让他吓了一跳，虽然他伪装得很好。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes," said the wizard. "Some of the scouts have been sent out already. More will go tomorrow. Elrond is sending Elves, and they will get in touch with the Rangers, and maybe with Thranduil's folk in Mirkwood. And Aragorn has gone with Elrond's sons. We shall have to scour the lands all round for many long leagues before any move is made. So cheer up, Frodo! You will probably make quite a long stay here."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，”巫师说：“有些侦察员已经出发了。明天会有更多的精灵出发，他们会和游侠们联络上，甚至是和幽暗密林中瑟兰督尔的属下会合。在作出任何决定之前，我们必须收集所有的情报。佛罗多，高兴起来吧！你可能会在这边待上很长一段时间。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So the days slipped away, as each morning dawned bright and fair, and each evening followed cool and clear. But autumn was waning fast; slowly the golden light faded to pale silver, and the lingering leaves fell from the naked trees. A wind began to blow chill from the Misty Mountains to the east. The Hunter's Moon waxed round in the night sky, and put to flight all the lesser stars. But low in the South one star shone red. Every night, as the Moon waned again, it shone brighter and brighter. Frodo could see it from his window, deep in the heavens burning like a watchful eye that glared above the trees on the brink of the valley.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="日子就这样一天天过去，每天都是清朗的早晨，每晚都有着清澈的天色和凉爽的天气。但秋天快要结束了，金黄色的光芒慢慢被银白色的光芒所取代，落叶从光秃秃的树上掉下，冰寒刺骨的东风开始从迷雾山脉上吹下。猎户之月星座在天空中绽放光明，遮掩了其他的小星星，但在南方，有一颗红色的星斗越来越亮，即使是月光都无法遮掩其锋芒。佛罗多每天都可以看见，它像是只永不疲倦的巨眼，俯瞰着世间的一切。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The hobbits had been nearly two months in the House of Elrond, and November had gone by with the last shreds of autumn, and December was passing, when the scouts began to return. Some had gone north beyond the springs of the Hoarwell into the Ettenmoors; and others had gone west, and with the help of Aragorn and the Rangers had searched the lands far down the Greyflood, as far as Tharbad, where the old North Road crossed the river by a ruined town. Many had gone east and south; and some of these had crossed the Mountains and entered Mirkwood, while others had climbed the pass at the source of the Gladden River, and had come down into Wilderland and over the Gladden Fields and so at length had reached the old home of Radagast at Rhosgobel. Radagast was not there; and they had returned over the high pass that was called the Dimrill Stair. The sons of Elrond, Elladan and Elrohir, were the last to return; they had made a great journey, passing down the Silverlode into a strange country, but of their errand they would not speak to any save to Elrond.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈比人几乎在爱隆的居所住了两个月之久，秋天也跟随着十一月的脚步消逝，慢慢地进入十二月。侦察员们这才开始回到出发点。有些人越过狂吼河，前往伊顿荒原，其他人则是往西走，在阿拉贡和游侠的协助下，搜索了灰泛河流域，一直到塔巴德附近，该处是北方大道越过灰泛河的一座废弃小镇。其他的探子则是往东和往南走，有些人越过了迷雾山脉，进入幽暗密林，其他的人沿着溪流来到格拉顿河的源头，跟着踏上大荒原，越过格拉顿平原，最后来到了瑞达加斯特的故乡。瑞达加斯特不在该处。于是他们又越过被称做丁瑞尔天梯的陡坡，回到原地来。爱隆的两个儿子伊莱丹和伊罗何是最后回来的两个人，他们沿着银光河前往一个陌生的国度；但他们不肯对爱隆以外的任何人透露任务的真正目的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Eight out of the Nine are accounted for at least," said Gandalf. "It is rash to be too sure, yet I think that we may hope now that the Ringwraiths were scattered, and have been obliged to return as best they could to their Master in Mordor, empty and shapeless.</div>

<div class="line_en">In no region had the messengers discovered any signs or tidings of the Riders or other servants of the Enemy. Even from the Eagles of the Misty Mountains they had learned no fresh news. Nothing had been seen or heard of Gollum; but the wild wolves were still gathering, and were hunting again far up the Great River. Three of the black horses had been found at once drowned in the flooded Ford. On the rocks of the rapids below it searchers discovered the bodies of five more, and also a long black cloak, slashed and tattered. Of the Black Riders no other trace was to be seen, and nowhere was their presence to be felt. It seemed that they had vanished from the North.</div>

The others go with him as free companions, to help him on his way. You may tarry, or come back, or turn aside into other paths, as chance allows. The further you go, the less easy will it be to withdraw; yet no oath or bond is laid on you to go further than you will. For you do not yet know the strength of your hearts, and you cannot foresee what each may meet upon the road."</div>

<div class="line_en">Gandalf walked in front, and with him went Aragorn, who knew this land even in the dark. The others were in file behind, and Legolas whose eyes were keen was the rearguard. The first part of their journey was hard and dreary, and Frodo remembered little of it, save the wind. For many sunless days an icy blast came from the Mountains in the east, and no garment seemed able to keep out its searching fingers. Though the Company was well clad, they seldom felt warm, either moving or at rest. They slept uneasily during the middle of the day, in some hollow of the land, or hidden under the tangled thorn-bushes that grew in thickets in many places. In the late afternoon they were roused by the watch, and took their chief meal: cold and cheerless as a rule, for they could seldom risk the lighting of a fire. In the evening they went on again, always as nearly southward as they could find a way.</div>

<div class="line_en">At the Ford of Bruinen they left the Road and turning southwards went on by narrow paths among the folded lands. Their purpose was to hold this course west of the Mountains for many miles and days. The country was much rougher and more barren than in the green vale of the Great River in Wilderland on the other side of the range, and their going would be slow; but they hoped in this way to escape the notice of unfriendly eyes.

<div class="line_en">A great sleepiness came over Frodo; he felt himself sinking fast into a warm and hazy dream. He thought a fire was heating his toes, and out of the shadows on the other side of the hearth he heard Bilbo's voice speaking. I don't think much of your diary, he said. Snowstorms on January the twelfth: there was no need to come back to report that!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="佛罗多突然觉得十分疲倦。他觉得自己慢慢沉入温暖、熟悉的梦乡。他感觉到有堆温暖的火正烘烤着他的脚趾，他似乎看见附近的陰影中出现了比尔博的声音；他对佛罗多说道：我对你的日记很不满意，他说，一月十二号大风雪，你没必要大老远跑回来只为了报告这件事吧！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Company now gathered together as close to the cliff as they could. It faced southwards, and near the bottom it leaned out a little, so that they hoped it would give them some protection from the northerly wind and from the falling stones. But eddying blasts swirled round them from every side, and the snow flowed down in ever denser clouds.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="众人尽可能靠近峭壁。峭壁面对南方，底端微微的伸出。因此，一行人希望能够靠着这天然的地势遮挡严酷的北风和落石。不过，寒风依旧从四面八方席卷而来，雪花更是毫不留情地从乌云中持续落下。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They huddled together with their backs to the wall. Bill the pony stood patiently but dejectedly in front of the hobbits, and screened them a little; but before long the drifting snow was above his hocks, and it went on mounting. If they had had no larger companions the hobbits would soon have been entirely buried.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们瑟缩着靠在峭壁上。比尔坚忍地站在哈比人前面保护他们，替他们挡下不少的寒风。但很快的，大雪开始在它背上累积起来，如果没有队伍中其它人的帮助，这些哈比人可能早就被活埋了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"What do you say to fire?" asked Boromir suddenly. "The choice seems near now between fire and death, Gandalf. Doubtless we shall be hidden from all unfriendly eyes when the snow has covered us, but that will not help us."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你们觉得生火怎么样？”波罗莫突然间说道：“这已经是生死关头了，甘道夫。如果大雪把我们掩盖，的确可以遮挡敌人的视线，但我们也活不了多久了！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“给他们这个，”甘道夫从行囊中掏出一个皮水壶：“我们每个人都应该喝一口，这非常珍贵。这是米卢活（译注一），是伊姆拉崔的提神药爱隆在出发前把它交给我。赶快传下去。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But though they had brought wood and kindlings by the advice of Boromir, it passed the skill of Elf or even Dwarf to strike a flame that would hold amid the swirling wind or catch in the wet fuel. At last reluctantly Gandalf himself took a hand. Picking up a faggot he held it aloft for a moment, and then with a word of command, naur an edraith ammen! he thrust the end of his staff into the midst of it. At once a great spout of green and blue flame sprang out, and the wood flared and sputtered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽然他们在波罗莫的先见之明下带来了柴火，但不管是矮人或是精灵，都没办法在强风中利用潮湿的木柴生火；最后，别无选择的甘道夫只得接手。他拿起一根木柴凝视了片刻，接着念诵着咒文 naur an edraith ammen！，随即将手杖插进地上的大堆木柴中。蓝色和绿色的火焰立刻从柴薪堆中冒出，变成了熊熊烈火。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You may make a fire, if you can," answered Gandalf. "If there are any watchers that can endure this storm, then they can see us, fire or no."</div>

<div class="line_en">But the Company cared no longer for watchers or unfriendly eyes. Their hearts were rejoiced to see the light of the fire. The wood burned merrily; and though all round it the snow hissed, and pools of slush crept under their feet, they warmed their hands gladly at the blaze. There they stood, stooping in a circle round the little dancing and blowing flames. A red light was on their tired and anxious faces; behind them the night was like a black wall.</div>

<div class="line_en">To this all agreed, but their retreat was now difficult. It might well prove impossible. Only a few paces from the ashes of their fire the snow lay many feet deep, higher than the heads of the hobbits; in places it had been scooped and piled by the wind into great drifts against the cliff.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="众人都同意这一点，但现在要回头可没这么简单。甚至困难到让人怀疑它的可行性。距离他们的火堆不过几尺远的地方，积雪就厚达好几尺深，比这些哈比人都还要高，有些地方还因为强风的吹拂而变成了靠着峭壁的小丘。">查看中文翻译</div>

Though all is now snow-clad, our path, as we came up, turned about that shoulder of rock down yonder. It was there that the snow first began to burden us.

<div class="line_en">Aragorn was the tallest of the Company, but Boromir, little less in height, was broader and heavier in build. He led the way, and Aragorn followed him. Slowly they moved off, and were soon toiling heavily. In places the snow was breast-high, and often Boromir seemed to be swimming or burrowing with his great arms rather than walking.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿拉贡是远征队中最高的成员，波罗莫虽然身高略逊，但身形比较壮硕。因此他带路，而阿拉贡跟在后面。他们的速度很慢，又常常受到积雪的拖累。有些地方，积雪甚至到胸口那么高。波罗莫看起来好像是用他满是肌肉的手臂，在雪地中游泳一样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="勒苟拉斯笑着打量着他们，然后转过身面对其他人：“你们刚刚说应该由最强壮的人来找路，对吧？不过，我认为，该耕田的就去耕田，擅水性的去游泳，至于要踏雪无痕、在森林中穿梭，还是交给我们精灵吧！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well," cried Legolas as he ran up, "I have not brought the Sun. She is walking in the blue fields of the South, and a little wreath of snow on this Redhorn hillock troubles her not at all. But I have brought back a gleam of good hope for those who are doomed to go on feet. There is the greatest wind-drift of all just beyond the turn, and there our Strong Men were almost buried. They despaired, until I returned and told them that the drift was little wider than a wall. And on the other side the snow suddenly grows less, while further down it is no more than a white coverlet to cool a hobbit's toes."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好啦，”勒苟拉斯跑过来的时候不禁大喊：“我把太陽带回来了。她正照耀在南方的大平原上，这点小雪完全不会让她感到困扰。除此之外，我还有一些好消息要告诉那些得用脚走路的倒楣家伙。转过弯之后有一个大雪丘，我们强壮的人类差点就被活埋在那边。幸好我回来即时告诉他们，那个雪丘不过只比一道墙宽不了多少。而在雪丘的另一边，因为大部分的风势都被挡住，因此雪少多了，更远的地方大概只够给哈比人泡泡脚而已。”">查看中文翻译</div>
