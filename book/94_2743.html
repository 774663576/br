<div class="line_en">Elsa's granny lived in another rhythm from other people. She operated in a different way. In the real world, in relation to everything that functioned, she was chaotic. But when the real world crumbles, when everything turns into chaos, then people like Elsa's granny can sometimes be the only ones who stay functional. That was another of her superpowers. When Granny was headed for some far-off place, you could only be sure of one thing: that it was a place everyone else was trying to get away from. And if anyone asked her why she was doing it, she'd answer, "I'm a doctor, for God's sake, and ever since I became one I've not allowed myself the luxury of choosing whose life I should be saving."</div>

<div class="line_en">So many hearts broke the day Elsa was born. Shattered with such force by the wave that the shards of glass were dispersed all around the world. Improbable catastrophes produce improbable things in people, improbable sorrow and improbable heroism. More death than human senses can comprehend. Two boys carrying their mother to safety and then turning back for their father. Because a family does not leave anyone behind. And yet, in the end, that is precisely what they did, her boys. Left her alone.</div>

<div class="line_en">She wasn't big on efficiency and economics, Granny, but everyone listened to her when there was chaos. The other doctors wouldn't be seen dead with her on a good day, but when the world collapsed into pieces they followed her like an army. Because improbable tragedies create improbable superheroes.</div>

<div class="line_en">And then Granny had squeezed her forefingers hard and replied, "Then we do what everyone does, we do everything we can." Elsa had crept up into her lap and asked: "But what can we do?"

<div class="line_cn" title="外婆用力捏着她的手指回答：“那我们要做每个人都会做的事，做每一件我们能做的事。”爱莎爬上外婆的大腿，问：“但我们能做什么呢？”外婆亲了亲她的头发，紧紧、紧紧地抱住她，低声说：“我们尽可能多地带上所有孩子，然后跑得越远越好。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Once, late one night when they were on their way to Miamas, Elsa had asked Granny about it, about how it felt to be somewhere when the world crumbles. And how it was being in the Land-of-Almost-Awake during the War-Without-End and what it was like when they saw that wave breaking over the ninety-nine snow-angels. And Granny had answered: "It's like the very worst thing you could dream up, worked out by the most evil thing you could imagine and multiplied by a figure you can't even imagine." Elsa had been very afraid that night, and she had asked Granny what they would do if one day their world crumbled around them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="某天晚上，在前往密阿玛斯的路上，爱莎问外婆身处世界毁灭的地方是什么感受，在无尽战争中的不眠大陆又是什么感觉，看着大浪摧毁九十九个雪天使是怎样的情形。外婆回答：“那是你能梦见的最可怕的事，被你能想象到的最邪恶的东西操控，以你想都不敢想的数量一次次重演。”爱莎那晚被吓坏了，她问外婆，如果有一天她们的世界被摧毁，她们该怎么办。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The day Elsa was born, Granny was far away. In a war. She had been there for months, but was on her way to an aircraft. On her way home. That was when she heard about the wave in another place even farther away, from which everyone was in desperate flight. So she went, because they needed her. She had time to help many children escape death, but not the boys of the woman with the black skirt. So she brought home the woman with the black skirt instead.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱莎出生那天，外婆离家很远，身处一场战争之中。她在那儿已经待了好几个月，当时正在乘飞机回来的路上。她听说了更遥远的地方的那场巨浪，每个人都绝望地从那里逃走。所以，她去了，因为他们需要她。她来得及帮助很多孩子死里逃生，却没能救得了黑裙女人的两个儿子。所以，她把黑裙女人带回了家。">查看中文翻译</div>

And then Dad drank three beers and told a story about how Mum, while heavily pregnant with Elsa, got out of the car and went up to a man in a silver car and threatened to "give birth here and now on his sodding hood if he honked at her again!" Everyone laughed a lot at that story. Not Dad, of course, because he's not a big fan of laughing. But Elsa saw that even he found it funny. He danced with Mum that Midsummer. That was the last time Elsa saw them dancing together. Dad is spectacularly bad at dancing; he looks like a very large bear that has just got up and realizes its foot has gone to sleep. Elsa misses it.</div>
