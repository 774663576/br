<div class="line_en">It was half past two in the morning. In the lighthouse, Grace was asleep in her room. It was a small, tidy room, with white walls. Her dress was on the back of the door, and her other clothes were on a chair by the bed. There were some books on a desk, and some sea-birds' eggs on a table.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凌晨两点半。灯塔里，格雷丝在自己的房间里睡觉。这是一个整洁的小房间，墙壁雪白。她的裙子挂在门后，其他衣服放在床边的椅子上。书桌上有一些书，桌子上有一些海鸟蛋。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"All right. I'll be down in a minute." Quickly, Grace closed the door and put her clothes on. She often got up in the night. There was always work on a lighthouse, and the sea did not wait for morning. A minute later, she ran downstairs to the kitchen, put a coat over her thin dress, tied her hair under her hat, and followed her father out into the night.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好的，我马上下去。”格雷丝迅速关上门穿好衣服。她经常半夜起来。在灯塔总有活儿可干，而且大海从不会等天亮再发作。一分钟后，她跑到楼下的厨房，在单薄的裙子外面罩上一件外套，把头发束到帽子里，然后跟着父亲出门，走进夜色里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What is it, father?" She got up quickly, and opened the door. William Darling stood there with a candle in his hand. He was wearing his big black coat and heavy boots, and his hat was pulled down over his ears. His face was tired, and wet with rain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“怎么了，爸爸？”她飞快地下床，打开房门。威廉·达林手握蜡烛站在那里。他身着黑色大外套，脚穿一双厚重的靴子，帽子拉低盖住了耳朵。他满脸倦容，被雨水淋得湿漉漉的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The storm is worse. The wind is coming from the north now, and it's stronger. We shall have to go outside and tie the boat down, or we shall lose it!"</div>

<div class="line_en">She walked slowly after her father, to the boathouse. Her father was carrying a small lantern, and in its light Grace saw a great wave of white water. It broke against the rock in front of the boathouse, and white water crashed against the boathouse doors. William shouted something to Grace but she could not hear him -- the sounds of the wind and the sea were too loud, too terrible.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她尾随父亲缓步来到船屋。父亲拎着一个小提灯，借着灯光，格雷丝看到一个巨大的白浪打在船屋门前的礁石上飞溅开来，浪花飞到船屋的门上。威廉向格雷丝喊着什么，但她听不见——风声和海浪声太大，太猛烈了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The wind nearly lifted her off her feet. It was strong, black, hard, and wet. She opened her mouth to call to her father, but the words blew away into the night. Her coat and dress blew out behind her like paper, and the rain hit her face, like small stones.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大风几乎将她吹起来了。黑夜里，狂风夹着雨水，凶猛而潮湿。她张开嘴要喊父亲，但声音被风声淹没，消散在黑夜里。她的外套和裙子如同纸片一般被风吹到身后乱舞着，雨水像小石子一样打到她脸上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the boathouse, she helped her father tie the boat down to the rock. They tied down the oars, too, so that nothing could move them. Then they ran outside and carried everything into the kitchen -- their chickens, their fishing things. Nothing could stay outside on a night like this.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在船屋里，她帮助父亲把船绑到礁石上；他们还绑好了船桨，这样它们就不会被冲走。然后他们跑出来，把所有东西——包括他们养的鸡和渔具——都带回厨房。没有什么能经得住今晚外面的风雨。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Before they went back in, Grace stared out into the night. The light from the top of the lighthouse flashed out over the water, and for thirty seconds she could see very well. One after another, the big, black waves came out of the darkness -- waves ten, twenty metres high! When they hit the rock there was a huge crash, and white water flew everywhere, thirty, forty metres up over the Longstone rock.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="进屋前，格雷丝向茫茫夜色中眺望。灯塔顶上发出的光洒到水面上，有三十秒钟她能看得很清楚。黑色的巨浪接二连三地从黑暗中扑出来——海浪足有一二十米高！它们撞击到礁石就会迸发出巨大的声响，水花四溅，飞到长石岛上空三四十米高的地方。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Grace! Come on in, lass!" Her father held the door open behind her. She went in quickly, and he closed the door behind them. Her mother had warm drinks ready for them.</div>

<div class="line_en">Grace stared out, over the waves, past the rocks and islands. But -- thank God! -- she could see no lights, no ships. No ship could live in that sea tonight.</div>
