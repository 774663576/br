<div class="line_en">The police had brought a cab with them, and in this I escorted Miss Morstan back to her home. After the angelic fashion of women, she had borne trouble with a calm face as long as there was someone weaker than herself to support, and I had found her bright and placid by the side of the frightened housekeeper. In the cab, however, she first turned faint and then burst into a passion of weeping -- so sorely had she been tried by the adventures of the night. She has told me since that she thought me cold and distant upon that journey. She little guessed the struggle within my breast, or the effort of self-restraint which held me back. My sympathies and my love went out to her, even as my hand had in the garden. I felt that years of the conventionalities of life could not teach me to know her sweet, brave nature as had this one day of strange experiences. Yet there were two thoughts which sealed the words of affection upon my lips. She was weak and helpless, shaken in mind and nerve. It was to take her at a disadvantage to obtrude love upon her at such a time. Worse still, she was rich. If Holmes's researches were successful, she would be an heiress. Was it fair, was it honourable, that a half-pay surgeon should take such advantage of an intimacy which chance had brought about? Might she not look upon me as a mere vulgar fortune-seeker? I could not bear to risk that such a thought should cross her mind. This Agra treasure intervened like an impassable barrier between us.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was nearly two o'clock when we reached Mrs. Cecil Forrester's. The servants had retired hours ago, but Mrs. Forrester had been so interested by the strange message which Miss Morstan had received that she had sat up in the hope of her return. She opened the door herself, a middle-aged, graceful woman, and it gave me joy to see how tenderly her arm stole round the other's waist and how motherly was the voice in which she greeted her. She was clearly no mere paid dependant but an honoured friend. I was introduced, and Mrs. Forrester earnestly begged me to step in and tell her our adventures. I explained, however, the importance of my errand and promised faithfully to call and report any progress which we might make with the case. As we drove away I stole a glance back, and I still seem to see that little group on the step -- the two graceful, clinging figures, the half-opened door, the hall-light shining through stained glass, the barometer, and the bright stair-rods. It was soothing to catch even that passing glimpse of a tranquil English home in the midst of the wild, dark business which had absorbed us.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们抵达塞西尔·福里斯特夫人家的时候，已经将近两点了。仆人已经休息了，可是福里斯特夫人对摩斯坦小姐接到怪信这件事非常关心，所以，她还坐在灯下，等候着摩斯坦小姐。她亲自开了门；她是一个中年妇女，非常优雅。我很高兴看到她温柔地挽着摩斯坦小姐的腰，用慈母般的语调迎接她。可见摩斯坦小姐在这里不仅仅是一个被雇佣的人，还是一个受到尊重的朋友。经过介绍，福里斯特夫人诚恳地邀请我进去坐坐，跟她聊聊我们这件案子的进展。不过，我向她解释，我今晚还有重要的事情要做，并承诺一定会再来拜访，如果事情有任何进展，也会告诉她。当我们乘着马车离开时，我偷偷回头看了一眼，依稀能看到台阶上的那一组图——两个优雅的手拉着手的身影、半开的门、从有色玻璃里透出来的大厅灯光、晴雨表，还有闪亮的楼梯毯棍。在身陷那样一件可怕、邪恶的事件之中时，瞧一瞧这么一个宁静的英国家庭，我心情就畅快多了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Pinchin Lane was a row of shabby, two-storied brick houses in the lower quarter of Lambeth. I had to knock for some time at No. 3 before I could make any impression. At last, however, there was the glint of a candle behind the blind, and a face looked out at the upper window.</div>

<div class="line_en">And the more I thought of what had happened, the wilder and darker it grew. I reviewed the whole extraordinary sequence of events as I rattled on through the silent, gas-lit streets. There was the original problem: that at least was pretty clear now. The death of Captain Morstan, the sending of the pearls, the advertisement, the letter -- we had had light upon all those events. They had only led us, however, to a deeper and far more tragic mystery. The Indian treasure, the curious plan found among Morstan's baggage, the strange scene at Major Sholto's death, the rediscovery of the treasure immediately followed by the murder of the discoverer, the very singular accompaniments to the crime, the footsteps, the remarkable weapons, the words upon the card, corresponding with those upon Captain Morstan's chart -- here was indeed a labyrinth in which a man less singularly endowed than my fellow-lodger might well despair of ever finding the clue.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="而对于今晚发生的事情，我越想就越觉得可怕、邪恶。当穿梭在被灯照亮的寂静街道上时，我回想了一遍这一连串奇异的事件。最初的问题至少现在已经很清楚了。关于摩斯坦上尉的死、寄出的珍珠、报上登出的广告以及那封信，我们现在已经明白了。但它们却把我们引向了更深远、更悲惨的神秘案件之中。那些印度珍宝、在摩斯坦的行李里找出的神秘图纸、肖尔托少校临死时的奇怪状况、财宝找到后紧接着发生的谋杀案、与罪案相伴出现的奇特事物、那些脚印、那些特别的武器、卡片上的字——跟摩斯坦上尉的图纸上的字一模一样——这真是一系列错综复杂的情况，除非是像我的合租人福尔摩斯那样有天赋的人，否则肯定在找寻线索之前就绝望了。">查看中文翻译</div>

It accepted, after some hesitation, a lump of sugar which the old naturalist handed to me, and, having thus sealed an alliance, it followed me to the cab and made no difficulties about accompanying me. It had just struck three on the Palace clock when I found myself back once more at Pondicherry Lodge. The ex-prize-fighter McMurdo had, I found, been arrested as an accessory, and both he and Mr. Sholto had been marched off to the station. Two constables guarded the narrow gate, but they allowed me to pass with the dog on my mentioning the detective's name.</div>

Holmes then threw the handkerchief to a distance, fastened a stout cord to the mongrel's collar, and led him to the foot of the water-barrel. The creature instantly broke into a succession of high, tremulous yelps and, with his nose on the ground and his tail in the air, pattered off upon the trail at a pace which strained his leash and kept us at the top of our speed.</div>

<div class="line_en">The east had been gradually whitening, and we could now see some distance in the cold gray light. The square, massive house, with its black, empty windows and high, bare walls, towered up, sad and forlorn, behind us. Our course led right across the grounds, in and out among the trenches and pits with which they were scarred and intersected. The whole place, with its scattered dirt-heaps and ill-grown shrubs, had a blighted, ill-omened look which harmonized with the black tragedy which hung over it.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Pshaw, my dear boy! It was simplicity itself. I don't wish to be theatrical. It is all patent and above-board. Two officers who are in command of a convict-guard learn an important secret as to buried treasure. A map is drawn for them by an Englishman named Jonathan Small. You remember that we saw the name upon the chart in Captain Morstan's possession. He had signed it in behalf of himself and his associates -- the sign of the four, as he somewhat dramatically called it. Aided by this chart, the officers -- or one of them -- gets the treasure and brings it to England, leaving, we will suppose, some condition under which he received it unfulfilled. Now, then, why did not Jonathan Small get the treasure himself? The answer is obvious. The chart is dated at a time when Morstan was brought into close association with convicts. Jonathan Small did not get the treasure because he and his associates were themselves convicts and could not get away."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, now, let us put ourselves in the place of Jonathan Small. Let us look at it from his point of view. He comes to England with the double idea of regaining what he would consider to be his rights and of having his revenge upon the man who had wronged him. He found out where Sholto lived, and very possibly he established communications with someone inside the house. There is this butler, Lal Rao, whom we have not seen. Mrs. Bernstone gives him far from a good character. Small could not find out, however, where the treasure was hid, for no one ever knew save the major and one faithful servant who had died. Suddenly Small learns that the major is on his deathbed. In a frenzy lest the secret of the treasure die with him, he runs the gauntlet of the guards, makes his way to the dying man's window, and is only deterred from entering by the presence of his two sons. Mad with hate, however, against the dead man, he enters the room that night, searches his private papers in the hope of discovering some memorandum relating to the treasure, and finally leaves a memento of his visit in the short inscription upon the card. He had doubtless planned beforehand that, should he slay the major, he would leave some such record upon the body as a sign that it was not a common murder but, from the point of view of the four associates, something in the nature of an act of justice. Whimsical and bizarre conceits of this kind are common enough in the annals of crime and usually afford valuable indications as to the criminal. Do you follow all this?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好，现在，让我们站在乔纳森·斯莫尔的立场上想想。让我们从他的角度来想想。他回到英国，应该有两个目的，一个是为了获得属于他的宝物，另一个是报复欺骗他的人。他找到了肖尔托少校住的地方，而且很有可能，他买通了家里面的一个人。有一个叫做拉尔·拉奥的仆人，我们并没有见过。伯恩斯通太太说过他性情顽劣。然而，斯莫尔没有找到藏宝的地方，因为除了少校和他忠心耿耿的仆人以外，没有人知道。忽然有一天，斯莫尔听说少校病危了。他害怕宝藏的秘密将和少校的尸体一起被掩埋，盛怒之下，他冒着被守卫抓住的危险，跑到垂死病人的窗前，但因为少校的两个儿子在床边，所以他没能进屋。然而，带着对死者的仇恨，当天晚上，他就潜入他的房间，翻动其私人文件，希望能找到关于宝藏的记录，可最后，他只留下一张写着简短题字的卡片，作为到访留念。毫无疑问，他事先进行了策划，如果他杀死了少校，也会在尸体上留这样的字条，表明这不是一起普通的谋杀案，而是一项伸张正义的行为——在那四位伙伴看来是如此。像这样奇怪的办法，在犯罪史上是很常见的，有时还能提供关于凶手的重要线索。这些你都明白了吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Or had escaped. That is much more likely, for he would have known what their term of imprisonment was. It would not have been a surprise to him. What does he do then?

The others are Hindoos or Mohammedans. There is no other white man. Therefore we may say with confidence that the wooden legged man is identical with Jonathan Small. Does the reasoning strike you as being faulty?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“或者已经越狱了。后者更有可能，因为他应该清楚他们的刑期有多长。所以，刑满出狱并不会让他这么惊讶。他到底对他们做了些什么呢？他很防备一个装有木腿的人——请注意，是一个白人，因为他曾经开枪误伤了一个装有木腿的白人商人。图纸上只有一个白人的名字。其他的都是印度人或者回教徒的名字。没有其他白种人了。因此，我们可以肯定地说，那个装有木腿的人就是乔纳森·斯莫尔。你看，这些理论有没有漏洞呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Now what could Jonathan Small do? He could only continue to keep a secret watch upon the efforts made to find the treasure. Possibly he leaves England and only comes back at intervals. Then comes the discovery of the garret, and he is instantly informed of it. We again trace the presence of some confederate in the household. Jonathan, with his wooden leg, is utterly unable to reach the lofty room of Bartholomew Sholto. He takes with him, however, a rather curious associate, who gets over this difficulty but dips his naked foot creosote, whence come Toby, and a six-mile limp for a half-pay officer with a damaged tendo Achillis."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“然后，乔纳森·斯莫尔还会做什么呢？他只会继续秘密地关注寻找宝藏的努力过程。也许他已经离开英国了，只是偶尔回来。当顶楼的宝物被发现的时候，他马上就知道了。我们再一次觉察到，他在房子里绝对有内线。乔纳森戴着木腿，绝对不可能爬到巴塞洛缪·肖尔托家的楼上去。但是，他带着一位神秘的伙伴，那位伙伴解决了难题，但脚上却沾上了木馏油，因此才有了托比的出场，还弄得一个跟腱受了伤的半俸医生不得不瘸着腿走了六英里的路。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Quite so. And rather to Jonathan's disgust, to judge by the way he stamped about when he got into the room. He bore no grudge against Bartholomew Sholto and would have preferred if he could have been simply bound and gagged. He did not wish to put his head in a halter. There was no help for it, however: the savage instincts of his companion had broken out, and the poison had done its work: so Jonathan Small left his record, lowered the treasure-box to the ground, and followed it himself. That was the train of events as far as I can decipher them. Of course, as to his personal appearance, he must be middle-aged and must be sunburned after serving his time in such an oven as the Andamans. His height is readily calculated from the length of his stride, and we know that he was bearded. His hairiness was the one point which impressed itself upon Thaddeus Sholto when he saw him at the window. I don't know that there is anything else."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“应该是的。而且，从斯莫尔在房间里跺脚的情况来看，他是反对这么做的。他和巴塞洛缪·肖尔托并没有深仇大恨，把他的嘴堵上再捆起来就够了。他不想为此付出生命的代价。但这毫无帮助，那位同谋的野蛮本性已经爆发了，毒药也发挥了作用，所以斯莫尔留下了纸条，把宝盒降到地面上，自己也落到地面上，逃走了。这是我所能推论出来的情况。当然，就他的外貌来说，必然是一位中年男子，而由于长年被羁押在酷热的安达曼岛，皮肤也应该是黝黑的。从他步伐的长短，就可以准确计算出他的身高，而我们知道他蓄胡子。他的须发茂盛，这在塞迪厄斯·肖尔托隔着窗户看到他时就有印象。我不知道还有没有什么别的了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

The men whom we pursued seemed to have taken a curiously zigzag road, with the idea probably of escaping observation. They had never kept to the main road if a parallel sidestreet would serve their turn. At the foot of Kennington Lane they had edged away to the left through Bond Street and Miles Street. Where the latter street turns into Knight's Place, Toby ceased to advance but began to run backward and forward with one ear cocked and the other drooping, the very picture of canine indecision.

With lolling tongue and blinking eyes Toby stood upon the cask, looking from one to the other of us for some sign of appreciation.
