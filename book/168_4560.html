<div class="line_en">The new crown that his father had given the Faith stood twice as tall as the one the mob had smashed, a glory of crystal and spun gold. Rainbow light flashed and shimmered every time the High Septon moved his head, but Tyrion had to wonder how the man could bear the weight. And even he had to concede that Joffrey and Margaery made a regal couple, as they stood side-by-side between the towering gilded statues of the Father and the Mother.</div>

<div class="line_en">The bride was lovely in ivory silk and Myrish lace, her skirts decorated with floral patterns picked out in seed pearls. As Renly's widow, she might have worn the Baratheon colors, gold and black, yet she came to them a Tyrell, in a maiden's cloak made of a hundred cloth-of-gold roses sewn to green velvet. He wondered if she really was a maiden. Not that Joffrey is like to know the difference.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="新娘穿象牙色丝衣和密尔蕾丝裙，裙上无数颗小珍珠组成各种花朵，显得十分可爱。身为蓝礼的遗孀，她本该采用拜拉席恩家族的金与黑，却选择了提利尔家族的色彩，以示纯洁。新娘斗篷由绿天鹅绒制成，绣有一百朵金玫瑰。提利昂不知她究竟还是不是处女。反正乔佛里也不懂。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The king looked near as splendid as his bride, in his doublet of dusky rose, beneath a cloak of deep crimson velvet blazoned with his stag and lion. The crown rested easily on his curls, gold on gold. I saved that bloody crown for him. Tyrion shifted his weight uncomfortably from one foot to the other. He could not stand still. Too much wine. He should have thought to relieve himself before they set out from the Red Keep. The sleepless night he'd spent with Shae was making itself felt too, but most of all he wanted to strangle his bloody royal nephew.</div>

<div class="line_en">He remembered a cold morning when he'd climbed down the steep exterior steps from Winterfell's library to find Prince Joffrey jesting with the Hound about killing wolves. Send a dog to kill a wolf, he said. Even Joffrey was not so foolish as to command Sandor Clegane to slay a son of Eddard Stark, however; the Hound would have gone to Cersei. Instead the boy found his catspaw among the unsavory lot of freeriders, merchants, and camp followers who'd attached themselves to the king's party as they made their way north. Some poxy lackwit willing to risk his life for a prince's favor and a little coin. Tyrion wondered whose idea it had been to wait until Robert left Winterfell before opening Bran's throat. loffs, most like. No doubt he thought it was the height of cunning.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="还记得临冬城的那个寒冷清晨，他走下藏书塔的陡峭螺旋梯，发现乔佛里王子和猎狗在讨论杀狼的事。叫狗去杀狗，他这么说。但乔佛里再蠢也不会笨到支使桑铎·克里冈去害艾德·史塔克的儿子，因为猎狗会把事情原原本本地报告瑟曦。所以，这小子想必转到那群自王家车队启程起就紧随不舍的自由骑手、商人和小贩中寻找肮脏的杀手。不知是哪个弱智下人愿以生命来换取王子的青睐和一点钱币。提利昂思考由谁定计待劳勃离开临冬城后方才动手。大概是乔佛里本人，他会把这当作最巧妙的谋划。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The prince's own dagger had a jeweled pommel and inlaid goldwork on the blade, Tyrion seemed to recall. At least Joff had not been stupid enough to use that. Instead he went poking among his father's weapons. Robert Baratheon was a man of careless generosity, and would have given his son any dagger he wanted… but Tyrion guessed that the boy had just taken it. Robert had come to Winterfell. with a long tail of knights and retainers, a huge wheelhouse, and a baggage train. No doubt some diligent servant had made certain that the king's weapons went with him, in case he should desire any of them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="依稀记得王太子自己的匕首带有宝石圆头，刀刃嵌金线。至少他没有蠢到使这把刀，而是用了父亲收藏的武器。劳勃·拜拉席恩极其慷慨，儿子想要的玩意儿，自然无所不予…但提利昂认为乔佛里是私下取的。去临冬城那回，不仅跟了一大票骑士和随从，还有大轮宫及长长的辎重队，肯定有专人负责照看国王的兵器，以备不时之需。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The blade Joff chose was nice and plain. No goldwork, no jewels in the hilt, no silver inlay on the blade. King Robert never wore it, had likely forgotten he owned it. Yet the Valyrian steel was deadly sharp… sharp enough to slice through skin, flesh, and muscle in one quick stroke. I am no stranger to Valyrian steel. But he had been, hadn't he? Else he would never have been so foolish as to pick Littlefinger's knife.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="乔佛里挑的这把刀锋利且实用。它没有黄金装饰、没有宝石刀柄、没有银丝镶嵌、外观平凡无奇。它从未被劳勃国王使用过，处于被遗忘的角落，然而本身又是致命的瓦雷利亚钢…轻而易举便可划开皮肤、血肉和咽喉。你瞧，我是识货的。讽刺啊，小子，你却真正不识货！否则怎会选小指头的刀呢？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The seven vows were made, the seven blessings invoked, and the seven promises exchanged. When the wedding song had been sung and the challenge had gone unanswered, it was time for the exchange of cloaks. Tyrion shifted his weight from one stunted leg to the other, trying to see between his father and his uncle Kevan. If the gods are just, loff will make a hash of this. He made certain not to look at Sansa, lest his bitterness show in his eyes. You might have knelt, damn you. Would it have been so bloody hard to bend those stiff Stark knees of yours and let me keep a little dignity?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="国王夫妇发下七重婚誓、接受七层祝福，交换七次承诺，然后圣歌唱响，当无人上前质疑挑战，换斗篷的时刻便到了。提利昂将重心自一只短腿换到另一只，试图从父亲和凯冯叔叔中间看出去。若诸神有眼，该让小乔当众出丑。他不敢去望珊莎，不敢让夫人发觉自己眼中的苦涩。你当时应该跪下来，真该死，弯下那对僵硬的史塔克膝盖，妈的，为我保全一点起码的自尊有这么难？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mace Tyrell removed his daughter's maiden cloak tenderly, while Joffrey accepted the folded bride's cloak from his brother Tornmen and shook it out with a flourish. The boy king was as tall at thirteen as his bride was at sixteen; he would not require a fool's back to climb upon. He draped Margaery in the crimson-and-gold and leaned close to fasten it at her throat. And that easily she passed from her father's protection to her husband's. But who will protect her from loff? Tyrion glanced at the Knight of Flowers, standing with the other Kingsguard. You had best keep your sword well honed, Ser Loras.</div>

<div class="line_en">The why of it still eluded him. Simple cruelty, perhaps? His nephew had that in abundance. It was all Tyrion could do not to retch up all the wine he'd drunk, piss in his breeches, or both. He squirmed uncomfortably. He ought to have held his tongue at breakfast. The boy knows I know now My big mouth will be the death of me, I swear it.</div>

She had belonged to Renly, the handsome young prince who had loved them so well he had come back from beyond the grave to save them. And the bounty of Highgarden had come with her, flowing up the roseroad from the south. The fools didn't seem to remember that it had been Mace Tyrell who closed the roseroad to begin with, and made the bloody famine.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="还没到门口，提利昂便听见外面如潮般的欢呼。群众深深爱戴玛格丽，以至于愿意再给乔佛里机会。毕竟，她曾属于蓝礼，属于英俊的三王兄，属于那位甚至从坟墓中赶来拯救他们的英雄。况且她带来了富庶的高庭，食物和补给近期川流不息地自玫瑰大道涌入都城。蠢货们选择性地遗忘当初正是梅斯·提利尔封锁南境，引起了这场该死的饥荒。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Their litter had been sitting in the sun, and it was very warm inside the curtains. As they lurched into motion, Tyrion reclined on an elbow while Sansa sat staring at her hands. She is just as comely as the Tyrell girl. Her hair was a rich autumn auburn, her eyes a deep Tully blue. Grief had given her a haunted, vulnerable look; if anything, it had only made her more beautiful. He wanted to reach her, to break through the armor of her courtesy. Was that what made him speak? Or just the need to distract himself from the fullness in his bladder?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="坐轿搁在艳阳下，内里已被烤得十分闷热。入轿后，提利昂撑起手肘，而珊莎继续瞪着交叠的双手。她的美貌比之提利尔的明珠毫不逊色。头发是秋天的赤褐，眼睛为徒利的深蓝，悲伤让她憔悴寂寞，却也使她更为楚楚可爱。此时此刻，他只想上前拥抱，解开那礼貌的盔甲。这就是他开口的原因？抑或不过是为了舒缓肿胀的膀胱？">查看中文翻译</div>

When the litter halted in the castle yard, he let one of the grooms help her down. "We will be expected at the feast an hour hence, my lady. I will join you shortly." He walked off stiff-legged. Across the yard, he could hear Margaery's breathless laugh as Joffrey swept her from the saddle.

He had always had a yen to see the Titan of Braavos. Perhaps that would please Sansa.

<div class="line_en">But who would be mad enough to contest Joffrey's rule now, after what had befallen Stannis Baratheon and Robb Stark? There was still fighting in the riverlands, but everywhere the coils were tightening. Ser Gregor Clegane had crossed the Trident and seized the ruby ford, then captured Harrenhal almost effortlessly. Seagard had yielded to Black Walder Frey, Lord Randyll Tarly held Maidenpool, Duskendale, and the kingsroad. In the west, Ser Daven Lannister had linked up with Ser Forley Prester at the Golden Tooth for a march on Riverrun. Ser Ryman Frey was leading two thousand spears down from the Twins to join them. And Paxter Redwyne claimed his fleet would soon set sail from the Arbor, to begin the long voyage around Dome and through the Stepstones. Stannis's Lyseni pirates would be outnumbered ten to one. The struggle that the maesters were calling the War of the Five Kings was all but at an end. Mace Tyrell had been heard complaining that Lord Tywin had left no victories for him.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Harper also gave them several more familiar songs. "A Rose of Gold" was for the Tyrells, no doubt, as "The Rains of Castamere" was meant to flatter his father. "Maiden, Mother, and Crone" delighted the High Septon, and "My Lady Wife" pleased all the little girls with romance in their hearts, and no doubt some little boys as well. Tyrion listened with half a ear, as he sampled sweetcorn fritters and hot oatbread baked with bits of date, apple, and orange, and gnawed on the rib of a wild boar.</div>

Hamish left them, his place taken by a smallish elderly bear who danced clumsily to pipe and drum while the wedding guests ate trout cooked in a crust of crushed almonds. Moon Boy mounted his stilts and strode around the tables in pursuit of Lord Tyrell's ludicrously fat fool Butterbumps, and the lords and ladies sampled roast herons and cheese-and-onion pies. A troupe of Pentoshi tumblers performed cartwheels and handstands, balanced platters on their bare feet, and stood upon each other's shoulders to form a pyramid. Their feats were accompanied by crabs boiled in fiery eastern spices, trenchers filled with chunks of chopped mutton stewed in almond milk with carrots, raisins, and onions, and fish tarts fresh from the ovens, served so hot they burned the fingers.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then the heralds summoned another singer; Collio Quaynis of Tyrosh, who had a vermilion beard and an accent as ludicrous as Symon had promised. Collio began with his version of "The Dance of the Dragons," which was more properly a song for two singers, male and female. Tyrion suffered through it with a double helping of honey-ginger partridge and several cups of wine. A haunting ballad of two dying lovers amidst the Doom of Valyria might have pleased the hall more if Collio had not sung it in High Valyrian, which most of the guests could not speak. But "Bessa the Barmaid" won them back with its ribald lyrics. Peacocks were served in their plumage, roasted whole and stuffed with dates, while Collio summoned a drummer, bowed low before Lord Tywin, and launched into "The Rains of Castamere."</div>

Painted wooden armor clattered and clacked as the little knights bounced up and down in their saddles. Their shields were bigger than they were, and they wrestled manfully with their lances as they clomped along, swaying this way and that and eliciting gusts of mirth. one knight was all in gold, with a black stag painted on his shield; the other wore grey and white, and bore a wolf device. Their mounts were barded likewise. Tyrion glanced along the dais at all the laughing faces. Joffrey was red and breathless, Tornmen was hooting and hopping up and down in his seat, Cersei was chuckling politely, and even Lord Tywin looked mildly amused. Of all those at the high table, only Sansa Stark was not smiling.

As the lords and ladies guffawed and giggled, the little men came together with a crash and a clatter, and the wolf knight's lance struck the helm of the stag knight and knocked his head clean off. It spun through the air spattering blood to land in the lap of Lord Gyles. The headless dwarf careened around the tables, flailing his arms. Dogs barked, women shrieked, and Moon Boy made a great show of swaying perilously back and forth on his stilts, until Lord Gyles pulled a dripping red melon out of the shattered helm, at which point the stag knight poked his face up out of his armor, and another storm of laughter rocked the hall. The knights waited for it to die, circled around each other trading colorful insults, and were about to separate for another joust when the dog threw its rider to the floor and mounted the sow. The huge pig squealed in distress, while the wedding guests squealed with laughter, especially when the stag knight leapt onto the wolf knight, let down his wooden breeches, and started to pump away frantically at the other's nether portions.</div>

In the rear of the throne room scuffling had broken out around the doors, and the guests were trampling on each other. Ser Addam's gold cloaks moved in to restore order. Guests were rushing headlong out into the night, some weeping, some stumbling and retching, others white with fear. It occurred to Tyrion belatedly that it might be wise to leave himself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛格丽·提利尔倒在祖母怀中啜泣，“勇敢些，勇敢些，”老妇人呢喃道。泰半的乐师业已逃离，只有一个笛手留在旁听席里奏出一曲挽歌。王座厅底部的大门边，爆发了混战，宾客们互相践踏争夺，亚当爵士的金袍军连忙上前维持秩序。客人们不顾一切地冲向黑夜，有的哭泣，有的踉跄，有的呕吐，惨白的脸上写满恐惧。明智的选择是赶紧离开，提利昂迟钝地想。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">His sister sat in a puddle of wine, cradling her son's body. Her gown was tom and stained, her face white as chalk. A thin black dog crept up beside her, sniffing at Joffrey's corpse. "The boy is gone, Cersei," Lord Tywin said. He put his gloved hand on his daughter's shoulder as one of his guardsmen shooed away the dog. "Unhand him now. Let him go." She did not hear. It took two Kingsguard to pry loose her fingers, so the body of King Joffrey Baratheon could slide limp and lifeless to the floor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="太后瘫倒在一滩酒水里，怀抱着儿子冰冷的身躯。她的裙服破烂脏污，她的脸颊白如垩石。一只瘦黑狗爬到她身边，舔嗅小乔的尸体。“这孩子去了，瑟曦，”泰温公爵把戴手套的手放在女儿肩上，手下卫士则将狗赶开，“松手，让他走吧。”作母亲的浑然不觉，两名御林铁卫协力才把她手指掰开，于是七国之君乔佛里·拜拉席恩一世的尸体就这样柔软地、毫无声息地滑倒在王座厅的地板上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The High Septon knelt beside him. "Father Above, judge our good King Joffrey justly," he intoned, beginning the prayer for the dead. Margaery Tyrell began to sob, and Tyrion heard her mother Lady Alerie saying, "He choked, sweetling. He choked on the pie. It was naught to do with you. He choked. We all saw."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="总主教跪在死去的君主身边，“天上的圣父啊，求你公正地裁判我们的好国王乔佛里吧，”他拖长声音吟咏，开始作临终祷告。玛格丽·提利尔哭出声来，她母亲艾勒莉夫人则安慰道，“他噎住了，亲爱的，他被馅饼噎住了，不是你的错。他噎住了，我们都瞧见的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
