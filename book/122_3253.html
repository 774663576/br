<div class="line_en">The letter arrived as I was dressing for dinner in my rooms in Pall Mall on the evening of 23rd September 1902. London was deserted at that time of the summer, and I had become very bored and depressed with my daily routine of work at the Foreign Office, and dinner at my club in the evening. All my friends were away enjoying themselves at country house parties, but here was I, a fashionable young man with a bright future, who knew all the best people and belonged to all the best clubs -- and who was forced to remain in London because of my job.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="1902年9月23日傍晚，这封信送达我在蓓尔美尔街的寓所时，我正在房间里更衣准备吃晚饭。夏天的这个时候伦敦基本没什么人，我白天去外交部上班，晚上在俱乐部吃晚饭，程式化的日子过得我无聊又沮丧。我的朋友都离开伦敦去了乡间别墅，在各种聚会上寻欢作乐；而我，一个认识各界精英、跻身全部顶级俱乐部、前程似锦的时髦小伙子，却被迫因为工作留在伦敦。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I had encouraged my friends to believe that the Foreign Office could not manage without me during the summer, but the plain truth was that my work was neither interesting nor important. It consisted mostly of taking messages for absent officials, whose own holiday plans had upset mine.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我让朋友们以为夏天这段时间外交部离不了我，可事实却再明显不过：我的工作既没意思，也不重要。我的主要职责是替休假的官员传口信，正是他们的各种度假计划让我自己的假期泡了汤。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Although my friends had sent me sympathetic letters, it was clear that I had not been greatly missed, and now, at the end of September, I realized another bitter truth. Two more days, and I would be free to start my holiday -- but I had nowhere to go! The country house parties were all breaking up, and though I could always go home to Yorkshire, of course, which fashionable young man wants to spend his holiday with his own family?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尽管朋友们纷纷来信向我表示同情，但很明显他们并不怎么想念我。而现在，9月底到了，我又意识到另一个惨淡的事实：再过两天，我就能得空儿开始休假了——可我却没地方去！所有的乡间聚会都要结束了。当然了，不论怎样我总还可以回老家约克郡去，可哪个时髦的年轻人愿意跟自家人一起度假？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">You will probably be surprised to hear from me, as it's a long time since we met. But I write in the hope that you might like to come out here and join me in a little sailing and, perhaps, duck shooting. This part of the Baltic is very beautiful and there should be plenty of ducks soon, if it gets cold enough. The friend who was with me has had to leave, and I really need someone else, as I'd like to stay out here for a while.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="收到我的信你大概很惊讶，因为我们已经很久没见面了。不过，此番去信是希望你能过来跟我一起驾着游艇兜兜风，没准还能打打野鸭。波罗的海的这一带景色很美，而且如果天气变得够冷的话，很快就会有不少野鸭。之前跟我一起的朋友有事得离开，我真的需要再有个人陪我，因为我想在这儿多待一阵再回去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">If you can come -- and I do hope you can -- send a telegram to the post office at Flensburg. I know you speak German perfectly, and that will be a great help.</div>

<div class="line_en">The letter was a turning point in my life, though I did not know it at the time. During my lonely dinner that evening I was undecided. Yachting in the Baltic in October! I must be mad even to think of it. I was used to the kind of yachting party that took place in warm summer weather, on comfortable, luxurious yachts with servants to bring meals and drinks. But what kind of yacht was the Dulcibella? Davies, I remembered, was not rich. We had been at Oxford University together and had been quite friendly, but I had not seen much of him in the three years since then. On the few occasions we had met, I found him rather dull.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这封信是我人生的一个转折点，尽管那时我并不知道。那晚我孤单地吃着晚餐，感到犹豫不决。10月份驾游艇在波罗的海航行！想想都觉得疯狂。我所习惯的游艇聚会是在温暖的夏日，在舒适、豪华的游艇上，吃喝都有仆人侍候。可“达尔茜贝拉”号是一艘怎样的游艇呢？我印象中，戴维斯可不富裕。我们一起读牛津大学，关系还算不错，但毕业后的三年中我就没怎么见过他了。少有的几次见面，我也觉得他挺无趣的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">His letter, too, seemed rather unpromising. His friend had left him -- why? The Baltic was beautiful -- yes, but what about October storms? Did I really want to spend my holidays freezing in the Baltic, with a man who was sure to bore me to death?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的信读起来也不怎么靠谱儿。他的朋友走了——为什么？波罗的海景色很美——这倒没错儿，可10月里的风暴呢？难道我真想在波罗的海上度过一个瑟瑟发抖的假期，而且是跟这么一个肯定会让我无聊死的男人一起？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Two days later I was on the night ferry to Holland, with a huge pile of luggage and a ticket for Flensburg in my pocket. I'd had to go all round London to find the things that Davies wanted for the yacht, and I felt I was being generous and unselfish. Davies had said that he needed a friend, so I was doing a friend's duty and answering his call. It was just possible, of course, that I might enjoy myself as well.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两天后，我坐在开往荷兰的夜班渡轮上，带着一大堆行李，口袋里揣着一张去弗伦斯堡的车票。我不得不跑遍了整个伦敦才买齐戴维斯游艇上要用的东西，我觉得自己真是慷慨无私。戴维斯说过他需要一个朋友，我便尽朋友的本分去赴他的约。当然了，说不定我自己也会挺开心的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The train took me east, then north, through Germany, and by ten o'clock the next evening I was standing on the station platform at Flensburg, and Davies was greeting me.</div>

<div class="line_en">The stone steps were slippery, and I had only a wet piece of rope to hold on to. I went down carefully, conscious of collecting dirt on my trousers. Near the bottom, I slid on the mud and sat down with one foot in the water.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="石阶很滑，只有一条湿漉漉的绳子当扶手。我小心地往下走，生怕弄脏了裤子。快走到底时，我被脚下的泥滑了一下，跌坐在台阶上，一只脚踩进了水里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Are you ready?" called Davies from above. He passed down my large case, which almost filled the little boat. The rest of the luggage followed, making a big pile that shook dangerously every time I moved. Somehow Davies managed to climb into the boat, and started to row across the harbour.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好了吗？”戴维斯在上面喊道。他把我的大箱子递下来，整条船差不多就满了。接着是其他行李，在船上堆成了一大堆，我一动就摇摇欲坠。不过戴维斯勉勉强强挤上了船，开始向港口另一边划去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The yacht is a little way away," he explained. "I hate to be too near a town." Then, a few minutes later, "Look! There she is."</div>

<div class="line_en">I looked around, and saw, by the light of an oil lamp, that I was in a tiny cabin, almost filled with a large table. On each side there was a bench-like seat, above which was a shelf holding books, maps, and so on. Through a small door beyond the table I could see an old cooker. The whole place smelled of oil, cooking, and sea water.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我朝四下看去，借着一盏油灯的光亮，发现自己站在一间小小的船舱里，一张大桌子几乎占去了全部空间。桌子的四面各有一个条凳式的座位，上方是放书籍、地图等物品的架子。透过桌子另一头儿的小门，能看到一个破旧的炉灶。整个船舱散发着油烟、饭菜和海水的味道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You see," said Davies. "There's plenty of room to sit up straight." I wondered if this was meant to be a joke, as I was bent almost double. As I sat down, my knee came into contact with a sharp edge. "Watch out for the centreboard," said Davies. "She's a flat-bottomed boat, you know, good for sailing in shallow water. And in deep water you lower the centreboard. That way we can go almost anywhere."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你看，”戴维斯说，“地方挺大的，还能坐直呢。”我怀疑他这是句玩笑话，因为我都快要弓着身子了。我坐下时，膝盖碰到了一处尖尖的棱角。“小心点儿中插板。”戴维斯说，“你知道，这是艘平底游艇，适合在浅水航行。到了深水就把中插板放低，这样我们就几乎哪儿都能去了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他点起另一盏油灯，得意地给我看另一间船舱，船舱两侧各搭着一张窄窄的床。“这是我们睡觉的地方。”他说，“不过我不敢说这里有足够地方放你的东西。我看这些东西你都得用吧？”">查看中文翻译</div>

I closed the case, and sat down on it. There was only one good thing about this depressing arrival -- it wasn't raining. This thought made me look round at where we were.</div>

<div class="line_en">How it happened I do not know, but suddenly my mood changed. Perhaps it was the miserable look I had last seen on his face. Perhaps it was one of those moments of clear-sightedness that people sometimes have, when I saw my silly selfishness compared with a simple, generous nature. Or perhaps it was the air of mystery about the whole trip. I suddenly felt ashamed of myself, a fashionable young man, tired and dirty, sitting on a case that was almost as big as the "yacht" that was to carry it, and with no idea of what I was doing there. I decided, then and there, that I was going to enjoy this strange and unexpected adventure.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不知怎么，我的心情突然起了变化。可能是因为刚才戴维斯脸上那悲伤的神情；可能是因为对比他单纯、宽厚的性情，我看到了自己的愚蠢和自私——人有时候就是会突然看透一些事情；还可能是因为这次旅行透着的神秘气氛。我突然替自己感到羞耻，一个时髦的小伙子，坐在一只跟他脚下“游艇”差不多大的手提箱上，又累又脏，完全不知道自己为何而来。就在彼时彼地，我决定要享受这次从天而降的奇特冒险。">查看中文翻译</div>
