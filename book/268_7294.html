<div class="line_en">It was better because it wasn't raining yet, though the clouds were dense and opaque. It was easier because I knew what to expect of my day. Mike came to sit by me in English, and walked me to my next class, with Chess Club Eric glaring at him all the while; that was nattering. People didn't look at me quite as much as they had yesterday. I sat with a big group at lunch that included Mike, Eric, Jessica, and several other people whose names and faces I now remembered. I began to feel like I was treading water, instead of drowning in it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="说好多了，是因为雨还没下下来，虽然云层又厚又暗。这一天也轻松多了，因为我知道自己这一天都要做些什么了。迈克上英语课的时候坐在了我旁边，而且还把我送到了下一节课的地点“象棋俱乐部成”埃里克一直都瞪大眼睛看着他；这真让人受宠若惊。人们不像昨天那样老瞅我了。我跟一大群同学坐在一起吃午饭，其中包括迈克、埃里克、杰西卡等好几个现在我已经记住了名字和长相的同学。我开始感觉自己是在踩水，而不是在往下沉了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">All morning I was dreading lunch, fearing his bizarre glares. Part of me wanted to confront him and demand to know what his problem was. While I was lying sleepless in my bed, I even imagined what I would say. But I knew myself too well to think I would really have the guts to do it. I made the Cowardly Lion look like the terminator.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一上午，我都在担心午饭时间的到来，怕见到他异乎寻常的目光。可另一方面，我又想跟他面对面，要他跟我说清楚是怎么回事儿。睁着眼睛躺在床上的那段时间，我甚至把要说的话都想好了。可是我太了解我自己了，根本就不相信自己真有那个胆子。我努力让自己这个胆小的狮子看上去像魔鬼终结者。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was worse because I was tired; I still couldn't sleep with the wind echoing around the house. It was worse because Mr. Varner called on me in Trig when my hand wasn't raised and I had the wrong answer. It was miserable because I had to play volleyball, and the one time I didn't cringe out of the way of the ball, I hit my teammate in the head with it. And it was worse because Edward Cullen wasn't in school at all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="说糟糕多了，是因为我很累；我依然睡不着觉，因为风声还在房子四周回荡着。说糟糕多了，还因为三角课上我没举手，瓦纳先生却要我起来回答问题，而我又偏偏答错了。这天更是痛苦的，因为我不得不打排球，有一次球来了，我战战兢兢没从来球路线上躲开，就一球砸到了我队友的头上。说这天糟糕多了，还因为爱德华·卡伦根本就没来上学。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mike intercepted us and steered us to his table. Jessica seemed elated by the attention, and her friends quickly joined us. But as I tried to listen to their easy chatter, I was terribly uncomfortable, waiting nervously for the moment he would arrive. I hoped that he would simply ignore me when he came, and prove my suspicions false.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈克拦住了我们，要我们坐到他那张桌子上去。杰西卡似乎让他的这番殷勤弄得心花怒放了，她的朋友很快也加入了我们。但在我努力去听他们无拘无束的闲聊时，心里却特别不自在，忐忑不安地等待着他来的那一刻。我希望他来了以后，根本不会注意到我，从而证明是我怀疑错了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But when I walked into the cafeteria with Jessica -- trying to keep my eyes from sweeping the place for him, and failing entirely -- I saw that his four siblings of sorts were sitting together at the same table, and he was not with them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，我和杰西卡走进自助餐厅的时候——虽然我竭力不让自己东张西望地去找他，但结果还是完全没能控制住——我看见他的四个兄弟姐妹，一起坐在同一张桌上，而他没跟他们在一块儿。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他没有来，而随着时间一分一秒地过去，我变得越来越紧张不安了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I walked to Biology with more confidence when, by the end of lunch, he still hadn't showed. Mike, who was taking on the qualities of a golden retriever, walked faithfully by my side to class. I held my breath at the door, but Edward Cullen wasn't there, either. I exhaled and went to my seat. Mike followed, talking about an upcoming trip to the beach. He lingered by my desk till the bell rang. Then he smiled at me wistfully and went to sit by a girl with braces and a bad perm. It looked like I was going to have to do something about Mike, and it wouldn't be easy. In a town like this, where everyone lived on top of everyone else, diplomacy was essential. I had never been enormously tactful; I had no practice dealing with overly friendly boys.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="去上生物学课的时候，我心里踏实了许多，因为直到午餐结束，他依然没有露面。在去上课的路上，迈克忠诚地陪在我一旁，刚才他还在侃侃而谈金毛猎犬的特性来着呢。到了门口的时候，我屏住了呼吸，可爱德华·卡伦也没在教室里。我松了一口气，向座位上走去。迈克跟在我后面，大谈特谈即将到来的去海滩旅行的事情。他在我的课桌旁一直赖到了打铃，这才依依不舍地冲我笑了笑，无可奈何地过去坐到了一个戴着牙套、顶着一头乱糟糟的烫发的女孩旁边。看来对于迈克，我得想点儿招数了，而这不会是一件轻而易举的事情。在这样一个小镇，大家低头不见抬头见，讲求策略是最要紧的。我从来都不是个很圆滑的人；对付过于殷勤的男孩子我还没经验。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Last night I'd discovered that Charlie couldn't cook much besides fried eggs and bacon. So I requested that I be assigned kitchen detail for the duration of my stay. He was willing enough to hand over the keys to the banquet hall. I also found out that he had no food in the house. So I had my shopping list and the cash from the jar in the cupboard labeled FOOD MONEY, and I was on my way to the Thriftway.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="昨天晚上，我发现查理除了会煎鸡蛋和培根肉外，不太会做饭。于是我主动请缨，我住的这段期间，厨房的琐事全交给我好了。他自然是求之不得，毫不犹豫就交出了餐厅的钥匙。我还发现屋里没有吃的。于是列了个购物单，从那个贴“伙食”的橱柜里找到了查理放现金的罐子，拿了钱，所以现在我就出发去施利福特威超市。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When the school day was finally done, and the blush was fading out of my cheeks from the volleyball incident, I changed quickly back into my jeans and navy blue sweater. I hurried from the girls' locker room, pleased to find that I had successfully evaded my retriever friend for the moment. I walked swiftly out to the parking lot. It was crowded now with fleeing students. I got in my truck and dug through my bag to make sure I had what I needed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="终于捱到放学了，脸上打排球蹭红了的地方也不怎么红了，我飞快地换上了牛仔裤和深蓝色的毛线衫。匆匆地从女更衣室里出来，我愉快地发现，已经成功地将自己的那个猎犬朋友暂时甩掉了。我快步朝停车场走了过去。停车场此刻已经挤满了飞奔的学生。我坐进车里，翻了一遍书包，看需要的东西是不是都带齐了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I was relieved that I had the desk to myself, that Edward was absent. I told myself that repeatedly. But I couldn't get rid of the nagging suspicion that I was the reason he wasn't there. It was ridiculous, and egotistical, to think that I could affect anyone that strongly. It was impossible. And yet I couldn't stop worrying that it was true.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我一个人坐着一张桌子，爱德华旷课，真是让我感到很宽慰。我一遍又一遍地这样想着。可我老是怀疑是因为我的缘故，他才没有来，这种怀疑搅得我心神不定。真是太可笑、太自以为了不起了吧，居然以为自己会对一个人产生这么大的影响。那是不可能的。可是，我还是忍不住担心那是真的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I gunned my deafening engine to life, ignoring the heads that turned in my direction, and backed carefully into a place in the line of cars that were waiting to exit the parking lot. As I waited, trying to pretend that the earsplitting rumble was coming from someone else's car, I saw the two Cullens and the Hale twins getting into their car. It was the shiny new Volvo. Of course. I hadn't noticed their clothes before -- I'd been too mesmerized by their faces. Now that I looked, it was obvious that they were all dressed exceptionally well; simply, but in clothes that subtly hinted at designer origins. With their remarkable good looks, the style with which they carried themselves, they could have worn dishrags and pulled it off. It seemed excessive for them to have both looks and money. But as far as I could tell, life worked that way most of the time. It didn't look as if it bought them any acceptance here.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我发动了那震耳欲聋的发动机，没去理睬那些朝我望过来的同学们，小心翼翼地倒进了排着队等着出停车场的两辆车之间。等着的时候，我努力装出一副若无其事的样子，仿佛那个雷鸣般的轰鸣声是别人的车子发出来的，这时，我看见埃美特·卡伦、爱丽丝·卡伦和姓黑尔的那对双胞胎正钻进他们的车子，就是那辆亮闪闪的新沃尔沃。当然，我以前没有注意过他们的衣着——他们的相貌太令我着迷了。这一看，我才发现他们显然都穿得特棒；衣服很简洁，却全都巧妙地显示出是出自设计师的手笔。凭这么出色的相貌，凭他们的风度，就是穿着洗碗布也同样会迷倒一大片。这似乎过于完美了，他们真貌双全。但就我所知，生活大多数时候就是这样。这些似乎并没有让他们在这里得到认可。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">No, I didn't fully believe that. The isolation must be their desire; I couldn't imagine any door that wouldn't be opened by that degree of beauty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不，我并不完全相信是这样。肯定是他们自己不愿跟别人在一起的；我想象不出凭着这样的美，还会有哪扇门敲不开。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Thriftway was not far from the school, just a few streets south, off the highway. It was nice to be inside the supermarket; it felt normal. I did the shopping at home, and I fell into the pattern of the familiar task gladly. The store was big enough inside that I couldn't hear the tapping of the rain on the roof to remind me where I was.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="施利福特威超市离学校不远，往南只隔几条街，就在公路边上。在超市里边待着真好；感觉很正常。在那边的家里就是我负责采购，所以我很乐意重新负起这个责任。商店里面很大，听不见雨水滴在屋顶上的声音，可以暂时忘却自己身在何处。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They looked at my noisy truck as I passed them, just like everyone else. I kept my eyes straight forward and was relieved when I finally was free of the school grounds.</div>

<div class="line_en">When I got home, I unloaded all the groceries, stuffing them in wherever I could find an open space. I hoped Charlie wouldn't mind. I wrapped potatoes in foil and stuck them in the oven to bake, covered a steak in marinade and balanced it on top of a carton of eggs in the fridge.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到家后，我把所有的食品杂货都卸了下来，填满了我所能找到的储藏空间。希望查理不会介意。我用食品包装箔包了一些土豆，放进了烤箱烤，用调味汁儿腌了一块牛排，然后平放在了冰箱里的一盒子鸡蛋上面。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When I was finished with that, I took my book bag upstairs. Before starting my homework, I changed into a pair of dry sweats, pulled my damp hair up into a pony-tail, and checked my e-mail for the first time. I had three messages.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="做完这些，我拎着书包上楼了。做作业之前，我换了一套干爽的运动套装，把潮乎乎的头发扎成了一个马尾辫，还查了一下电子邮件，我来这里后还是第一次查收邮件，一共有三封。">查看中文翻译</div>

I guess he considered me old enough now not to shoot myself by accident, and not depressed enough to shoot myself on purpose.</div>

But they're all very mature -- I haven't had one speck of trouble from any of them. That's more than I can say for the children of some folks who have lived in this town for generations.

<div class="line_en">"Usually." He smiled widely, flashing a set of perfect, ultrawhite teeth.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mike skipped quickly to my side and picked up my books for me. I imagined him with a wagging tail.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈克迅速地蹿到了我的旁边并帮我把书捡了起来。我想象他和他说的那条金毛猎犬一样，在把东西找回来的时候可以摇他的追击者。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When the bell finally rang, Edward rushed as swiftly and as gracefully from the room as he had last Monday. And, like last Monday, I stared after him in amazement.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Cullen seemed friendly enough today," he commented as we shrugged into our raincoats. He didn't seem pleased about it.</div>

<div class="line_en">I couldn't concentrate on Mike's chatter as we walked to Gym, and PE. didn't do much to hold my attention, either. Mike was on my team today. He chivalrously covered my position as well as his own, so my woolgathering was only interrupted when it was my turn to serve; my team ducked warily out of the way every time I was up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="去体育馆的路上，迈克唠叨个没完，我却老走神，没听进去多少，而且体育课也没强到哪里去，我同样也是老分心。今天迈克和我在一个队，他很有骑士风范，除了守自己的位以外，还守了我的位，所以，我的胡思乱想只是轮到我发球时才得以打断；每次我跳起来的时候，我们队都得小心翼翼地躲闪避让。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I didn't have any trouble with it," I said, stung by his assumption. I regretted the snub instantly. "I've done the lab before, though," I added before he could get his feelings hurt.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“看这个我倒没有什么问题”我说，他的主观臆断我听了很不是滋味。可话一说出去，我马上就后悔了“不过，我以前做过这个实验”我趁他的感情还没受到伤害，赶紧补上了一句。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I looked around me to make sure it was clear. That's when I noticed the still, white figure. Edward Cullen was leaning against the front door of the Volvo, three cars down from me, and staring intently in my direction. I swiftly looked away and threw the truck into reverse, almost hitting a rusty Toyota Corolla in my haste. Lucky for the Toyota, I stomped on the brake in time. It was just the sort of car that my truck would make scrap metal of. I took a deep breath, still looking out the other side of my car, and cautiously pulled out again, with greater success. I stared straight ahead as I passed the Volvo, but from a peripheral peek, I would swear I saw him laughing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我朝四周瞧了瞧，以确定周围没有东西。也就是在这时，我看见一个静止的白色身影。爱德华·卡伦斜靠在离我有三辆车远的沃尔沃的前门上，正目不转睛地盯着我这个方向。我迅速将视线移开并猛地倒起车来，匆忙之中，差点儿撞上了一辆破旧的丰田花冠。幸亏我及时猛踩了一脚刹车，那辆丰田才逃过一劫。而丰田的车，正好是撞上我的卡车就会碎成废铜烂铁的那种车。我长吸了一口气，眼睛依然看着车子另一边的外头，又小心地往后倒起来，这一次成功多了。我从沃尔沃旁边经过时，眼睛盯着正前方，不过我还是用余光偷看了一眼，我敢发誓，他正在笑话我。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The rain was just a mist as I walked to the parking lot, but I was happier when I was in the dry cab. I got the heater running, for once not caring about the mind-numbing roar of the engine. I unzipped my jacket, put the hood down, and fluffed my damp hair out so the heater could dry it on the way home.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我去停车场时，雨已经只是一片雾雨了，但坐进了干爽的驾驶室后，我还是更为高兴一些。我打开了空调，一时也顾不得发动机那极度的轰隆声了。我拉开了上衣的拉链，把帽兜放了下来，抖开了湿气沉沉的头发，以便回家的路上空调可以把头发吹干。">查看中文翻译</div>
