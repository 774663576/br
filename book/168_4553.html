<div class="line_en">"Any displeasure I'm feeling has naught to do with pease. I have Joffrey and my sister to displease me, and my lord father, and three hundred bloody Dornishmen." He had settled Prince Oberyn and his lords in a cornerfort facing the city, as far from the Tyrells as he could put them without evicting them from the Red Keep entirely. It was not nearly far enough. Already there had been a brawl in a Flea Bottom pot-shop that left one Tyrell man-at-arms dead and two of Lord Gargalen's scalded, and an ugly confrontation in the yard when Mace Tyrell's wizened little mother called Ellaria Sand "the serpent's whore." Every time he chanced to see Oberyn Martell the prince asked when the justice would be served. Overcooked pease were the least of Tyrion's troubles, but he saw no point in burdening his young wife with any of that. Sansa had enough griefs of her own. "The pease suffice," he told her curtly. "They are green and round, what more can one expect of pease? Here, I'll have another serving, if it please my lady." He beckoned, and Podrick Payne spooned so many pease onto his plate that Tyrion lost sight of his mutton. That was stupid, he told himself. Now I have to eat them all, or she'll be sorry all over again.</div>

<div class="line_en">"No," Sansa said at once. "You… you are kind to offer, but… there are no devotions, my lord. No priests or songs or candles. Only trees, and silent prayer. You would be bored."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不要，”珊莎立时回答，“您…您真是太好心了，可…可那里很是冷清，大人。没有修士、没有圣歌、没有蜡烛，只有树木和默祷。您会厌烦的，大人。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"As you wish." He had become accustomed to his wife's nightly devotions. She prayed at the royal sept as well, and often lit candles to Mother, Maid, and Crone. Tyrion found all this piety excessive, if truth be told, but in her place he might want the help of the gods as well. "I confess, I know little of the old gods," he said, trying to be pleasant. "Perhaps someday you might enlighten me. I could even accompany you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“夫人，你想去就去吧。”他习惯了妻子的晚祷。珊莎同样也去王家圣堂祷告，经常在圣母、少女和老妪的祭坛前点蜡烛，说实话，提利昂觉得这些行为有点夸张，但换到妻子的角度，只怕的确需要神灵的安慰吧。“我得承认，我对旧神所知甚少，”他试着用和蔼的语气说，“或许某天，你可以给我启蒙启蒙，让我陪你去吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No doubt you're right." She knows me better than I thought. "Though the sound of rustling leaves might be a pleasant change from some septon droning on about the seven aspects of grace." Tyrion waved her off. "I won't intrude. Dress warmly, my lady, the wind is brisk out there." He was tempted to ask what she prayed for, but Sansa was so dutiful she might actually tell him, and he didn't think he wanted to know.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是吗？”她比我以为的更了解我。“其实我觉得听多了修士念颂七神的祷文，享受享受林间树叶的轻响也不错呢。”提利昂挥手与妻子作别。“没关系，我不会强行跟去，请你穿暖和点，夫人，外面冷。”他本打算问问她祈祷的是什么，但珊莎是如此尽责，到头来一定会说实话，他可不想知道答案。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He went back to work after she left, trying to track some golden dragons through the labyrinth of Littlefinger's ledgers. Petyr Baelish had not believed in letting gold sit about and grow dusty, that was for certain, but the more Tyrion tried to make sense of his accounts the more his head hurt. it was all very well to talk of breeding dragons instead of locking them up in the treasury, but some of these ventures smelled worse than week-old fish. I wouldn't have been so quick to let Joffrey fling the Antler Men over the walls if I'd known how many of the bloody bastards had taken loans from the crown. He would have to send Bronn to find their heirs, but he feared that would prove as fruitful as trying to squeeze silver from a silverfish.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="妻子走后，他继续埋头工作，努力从小指头留下的如迷宫般的账目中榨出一点钱财来。首先，培提尔不是那种将金银收归库房、任其腐烂生锈的人，而提利昂越是在账本中探索，头就越痛。“让金龙自我增值，不要束之高阁”，这些原则说着好听，但真正结合实际，简直就是一堆糊涂账。要是我早知道那些该死的“鹿角民”欠了王家多少钱，根本就不会让乔佛里把他们投出去！他打算叫波隆去寻觅他们的后代，但只怕这样的行动好比从银鱼里搜刮银子一样徒劳无用。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When the summons from his lord father arrived, it was the first time Tyrion could ever recall being pleased to see Ser Boros Blount. He closed the ledgers gratefully, blew out the oil lamp, tied a cloak around his shoulders, and waddled across the castle to the Tower of the Hand. The wind was brisk, just as he'd warned Sansa, and there was a smell of rain in the air. Perhaps when Lord Tywin was done with him he should go to the godswood and fetch her home before she got soaked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="柏洛斯·布劳恩爵士带来父亲大人的召唤时，提利昂发现自己头一次满心欢喜地看待这位爵士。他立刻合上账本，吹灭油灯，披上斗篷，穿过城堡去首相塔。外面很冷，正如他告诫珊莎的那样，空气中有雨的气息。或许等泰温公爵的事情说完，他该去神木林，亲自把夫人接回来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">His father offered him a roll of parchment. Someone had flattened it, but it still wanted to curl. "Roslin caught a fine fat trout," the message read. "Her brothers gave her a pair of wolf pelts for her wedding." Tyrion turned it over to inspect the broken seal. The wax was silvery-grey, and pressed into it were the twin towers of House Frey. "Does the Lord of the Crossing imagine he's being poetic? Or is this meant to confound us? " Tyrion snorted. "The trout would be Edmure Tully, the pelts…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="父亲递给他一卷羊皮纸。这张纸被刻意压平整，显然已有很多人翻过了。“萝丝琳套住一条肥美鳟鱼，”信上写道，“她的兄弟们为婚礼献上两张狼皮为礼。”提利昂翻过纸张，看了看上面的封印，只见银灰色蜡泥盖了佛雷家族的双塔纹章。“河渡口领主掉起文来啦？这到底什么意思？”提利昂哼了一声，“鳟鱼大概指艾德慕·徒利，狼皮嘛…”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But all that went straight out of his head when he entered the Hand's solar to find Cersei, Ser Kevan, and Grand Maester Pycelle gathered about Lord Tywin and the king. Joffrey was almost bouncing, and Cersei was savoring a smug little smile, though Lord Tywin looked as grim as ever. I wonder if he could smile even if he wanted to. "What's happened?" Tyrion asked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但等他走进首相书房，发觉瑟曦、凯冯爵士、派席尔国师、泰温公爵和国王的神情时，所有的思虑顿时抛诸脑后。乔佛里兴奋躁动，瑟曦自鸣得意地浅笑，只有父亲脸上依然严肃。不过我看得出那下面的喜悦神态。“怎么回事？”提利昂问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He's dead!" Joffrey sounded so proud and happy you might have thought he'd skinned Robb Stark himself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他死啦！”乔佛里欢快而骄傲地叫道，好像他亲手剥了罗柏·史塔克的皮。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">First Greyjoy and now Stark. Tyrion thought of his child wife, praying in the godswood even now. Praying to her father's gods to bring her brother victory and keep her mother safe, no doubt. The old gods paid no more heed to prayer than the new ones, it would seem. Perhaps he should take comfort in that. "Kings are falling like leaves this autumn," he said. "It would seem our little war is winning itself."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="先是葛雷乔伊，然后是史塔克。提利昂立刻想起还在神木林中祈祷的妻子。她大概正祈求父亲的神灵保佑哥哥胜利，保护母亲安全吧！看来，旧神和新神一样，对人们的呼吁不闻不问。当然，就他的角度而言，多少对此消息应该感到高兴。“这个秋天，国王跟树叶一样纷纷坠落，”他说，“看来咱们小小的战争不战而胜了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Most," agreed Lord Tywin. "Riverrun remains, but so long as Walder Frey holds Edmure Tully hostage, the Blackfish dare not mount a threat. Jason Mallister and Tytos Blackwood will fight on for honor's sake, but the Freys can keep the Mallisters penned up at Seagard, and with the right inducement Jonos Bracken can be persuaded to change his allegiance and attack the Blackwoods. In the end they will bend the knee, yes. I mean to offer generous terms. Any castle that yields to us will be spared, save one."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“大部分会，”泰温公爵同意，“奔流城不会，但只要瓦德·佛雷将艾德慕·徒利牢牢控制住，黑鱼就不是威胁。杰森·梅利斯特和泰陀斯·布莱伍德会为荣誉而战，不过佛雷家的兵力足以将梅利斯特钉在海疆城，而我们只需给予正确诱导，杰诺斯·布雷肯便会翻脸对付布莱伍德。没错，假以时日，他们终将臣服。我打算开出宽厚条件，任何地方，只要投降，归服王化，便可维持原状——一地例外。”">查看中文翻译</div>

The Brave Companions would end as heads on spikes, and Littlefinger would stroll into Harrenhal without so much as a spot of blood on those fine clothes of his. He wondered if Petyr Baelish had reached the Vale yet. lf the gods are good, he ran into a storm at sea and sank. But when had the gods ever been especially good?</div>
