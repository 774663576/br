<div class="line_en">Because of the scarcity of water, each camper was only allowed a four-minute shower. It took Stanley nearly that long to get used to the cold water. There was no knob for hot water. He kept stepping into, then jumping back from, the spray, until the water shut off automatically. He never managed to use his bar of soap, which was just as well, because he wouldn't have had time to rinse off the suds.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="由于缺水，所有的孩子洗澡时都不能超过四分钟。斯坦利花了差不多四分钟那么长才适应冷水。其实根本没有热水开关。斯坦利不停地一会儿走到喷头下，一会儿又跳出来，没过多久，水自动停了。他压根儿没来得及用肥皂，但这样也好，因为即便用了，也根本没时间冲掉肥皂泡。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dinner was some kind of stewed meat and vegetables. The meat was brown and the vegetables had once been green. Everything tasted pretty much the same. He ate it all, and used his slice of white bread to mop up the juice. Stanley had never been one to leave food on his plate, no matter how it tasted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="晚餐是炖菜，有荤有素。肉是褐色的，至于蔬菜——以前应该是绿色的。所有东西吃起来味道都差不多。他吃得一干二净，接着拿起一片白面包蘸了些汤汁吃。不管味道怎么样，斯坦利从来都不会把饭菜剩下。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Back at school, a bully named Derrick Dunne used to torment Stanley. The teachers never took Stanley's complaints seriously, because Derrick was so much smaller than Stanley. Some teachers even seemed to find it amusing that a little kid like Derrick could pick on someone as big as Stanley.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="以前在学校，一个叫德里克·邓恩的小霸王经常欺负斯坦利。老师们从不把斯坦利的抱怨当回事，因为德里克比斯坦利瘦小多了。像德里克这么瘦小的孩子怎么可能欺负得了像斯坦利那样的大块头，有些老师甚至觉得很可笑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As Stanley tried to turn over on his cot, he was afraid it was going to collapse under all his weight. He barely fit in it.

<div class="line_en">Stanley couldn't help but think that there was something special about the shoes, that they would somehow provide the key to his father's invention. It was too much of a coincidence to be a mere accident. Stanley had felt like he was holding destiny's shoes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯坦利忍不住想，这双鞋一定有些不同寻常的地方，或许它们会以某种方式为父亲的发明提供关键的帮助。事情发生得也太凑巧了，根本不会想到只是一桩意外。斯坦利感到手中紧握的是一双命运之鞋。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It turned out the sneakers had been stolen from a display at the homeless shelter. That evening rich people were going to come to the shelter and pay a hundred dollars to eat the food that the poor people ate every day for free. Clyde Livingston, who had once lived at the shelter when he was younger, was going to speak and sign autographs. His shoes would be auctioned, and it was expected that they would sell for over five thousand dollars. All the money would go to help the homeless.</div>
