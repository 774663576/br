<div class="line_en">By the end of October the rain had come, falling heavily upon the six-inch layer of dust which had had its own way for more than two months. At first the rain had merely splotched the dust, which seemed to be rejoicing in its own resiliency and laughing at the heavy drops thudding against it: but eventually the dust was forced to surrender to the mastery of the rain and it churned into a fine red mud that oozed between our toes and slopped against our ankles as we marched miserably to and from school.</div>

<div class="line_en">To shield us from the rain, Mama issued us dried calf- skins which we flung over our heads and shoulders like stiff cloaks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="遇到这种下雨天，妈妈就会拿晒干的小牛皮给我们当雨衣。我们把它披在头上和肩上，像是一件硬邦邦的斗篷。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We were not very fond of the skins, for once they were wet they emitted a musty odor which seeped into our clothing and clung to our skins. We preferred to do with- out them; unfortunately, Mama cared very little about what we preferred.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们很不喜欢牛皮，因为它一沾到水，就会散发出很难闻的味道，而且还会搞得衣服和皮肤也是这种味道。穿着它，我们还不如淋雨呢。不过妈妈并不在意我们怎么想。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Since we usually left for school after Mama, we solved this problem by dutifully cloaking ourselves with the skins before leaving home. As soon as we were beyond Big Ma's eagle eyes, we threw off the cloaks and depended upon the overhanging limbs of the forest trees to keep us dry. Once at school, we donned the cloaks again and marched into our respective classrooms properly attired.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="妈妈比我们早去学校，这使得我们想到一个绝好的办法来对付这件事情。从家里出发时，我们披上雨衣，一旦远离了奶奶的视线，我们就脱下雨衣到树底下避雨。快走到学校时，我们又披上雨衣，等到衣服差不多干了再走进教室。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">If we had been faced only with the prospect of the rain soaking through our clothing each morning and evening, we could have more easily endured the journey between home and school. But as it was, we also had to worry about the Jefferson Davis school bus zooming frolic behind and splashing us with the murky waters of the road. Knowing that the bus driver liked to entertain his passengers by sending us slipping along the road to the almost inaccessible forest banks washed to a smooth baldness by the constant rains, we continuously looked over our shoulders when we were between the two crossroads so that we could reach the bank before the bus was upon us. But sometimes the rain pounded so heavily that it was all we could do to stay upright, and we did not look back as often nor listen as carefully as we should; we consequently found ourselves comical objects to cruel eyes that gave no thought to our misery.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果只是淋雨的话，我们并不觉得有多么苦。不幸的是，我们还得提防杰斐逊大卫学校的校车，以防它从后头开过来溅我们一身泥。校车司机似乎很热衷于取悦他的乘客们。晴天时，我们还可以爬上土坡躲一躲；遇上下雨天，我们就爬不上土坡了。每当我们走到两个岔路口之间时，都会不停地往回看，赶在校车开过来前躲到土坡上。有时雨实在太大了，我们必须挺直身子往前走，没法时常回头看，雨声也会盖住校车的声音，结果我们又成了被捉弄的对象。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">No one was more angered by this humiliation than Little Man. Although he had asked Mama after the first day of school why Jefferson Davis had two buses and Great Faith had none, he had never been totally satisfied by her answer. She had explained to him, as she had explained to Christopher-John the year before and to me two years before that, that the county did not provide buses for its black students. In fact, she said, the county provided very little and much of the money which supported the black schools came from the black churches. Great Faith Church just could not afford a bus, so therefore we had to walk.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没有人比小家伙更愤愤不平了。虽然在开学第一天小家伙就问妈妈为什么杰斐逊大卫学校有两辆校车，而大信仰中小学却一辆校车也没有，但妈妈的回答并没有让他满意。两年前，我和克里斯托弗也有这样的疑问。妈妈解释说，县里并不为黑人学生提供校车，而且，政府拨给黑人学校的补助也很少，大部分的资助来自黑人教堂，所以我们学校就没有校车，我们只能每天走路上学。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This information cut deeply into Little Man's brain, and each day when he found his clean clothes splashed red by the school bus, he became more and more embittered until finally one day he stomped angrily into the kitchen and exploded. "They done it again, Big Ma! Just look at my clothes!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这些话深深地印在小家伙的脑海里。每次他被经过的校车弄得一身狼狈时，他的愤怒便加深一层。有一天，他终于忍无可忍，一放学就冲进厨房大喊：“奶奶！他们又这样！看，我的衣服又脏了！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Stacey and Christopher-John left to change into their work clothes, but Little Man sat on the side bench looking totally dejected as he gazed at his pale-blue pants crusted with mud from the knees down. Although each night Big Ma prepared a pot of hot soapy water for him to wash out his clothing, each day he arrived home looking as if his pants had not been washed in more than a month.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯泰西和克里斯托弗回房间换工作服了，而小家伙依然坐在那儿，盯着他牛仔裤上的红泥巴印。虽然每天晚上奶奶都会帮他把裤子洗得很干净，但第二天放学回来，那条裤子又像一个月没洗似的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Big Ma was not one for coddling any of us, but now she turned from the stove and, wiping her hands on her long white apron, sat down on the bench and put her arm around Little Man.

You jus' keep on studyin' and get yo'self a good education and you'll be all right. Now. go on and wash out yo' clothes and hang 'em by the fire so's I can iron 'em 'fore I go to bed."</div>

<div class="line_en">That night when I was snug in the deep feathery bed beside Big Ma, the tat-tat of the rain against the tin roof changed to a deafening roar that sounded as if thousands of giant rocks were being hurled against the earth. By morning the heavy rain had become a drizzle, but the earth was badly sodden from the night's downpour. High rivers of muddy water flowed in the deep gullies, and wide lakes shimmered on the roads.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天晚上，我躺在柔软的羽毛床褥上，和奶奶睡在一起。雨点滴滴答答敲打着铁皮屋顶，后来雨越下越大，像是无数块大石头砸落在地上一样，声音有些吓人。第二天早上，大雨变成了毛毛细雨，不过昨晚的倾盆大雨已经将外面变成了一片汪洋。河水夹杂着泥沙淌入水沟，池塘水也漫到了路上。">查看中文翻译</div>

Although we had left home earlier than usual to cover the northern road before the bus came, we were not overly confident that we would miss it, for we had tried this strategy before.

It was a grand car with chrome shining even in the rain, and the only one like it in the county, so it was said. We groaned.

<div class="line_en">I peeped around Big Ma's long skirts and saw Mama guiding Stacey to her own desk. Then back she went for Little Man and, picking him up bodily, set him in the chair beside her rocker. Christopher-John she left alone at the study table. Then she gathered all our study materials and brought them to us along with a look that said she would tolerate no more of this foolishness.</div>

<div class="line_en">With Big Ma before me, I could see nothing else and I grew serious enough to complete my arithmetic assignment. When that was finished, I lingered before opening my reader, watching Big Ma as she hung up my ironed dress, then placed her heavy iron on a small pile of embers burning in a corner of the fireplace and picked up a second iron already warming there. She tested the iron with a tap of her finger and put it back again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="由于被奶奶挡住了视线，我什么也看不到，只能集中精力写我的算术作业。做完之后，我没有马上开始温习功课，而是看着奶奶把熨好的衣服挂起来，然后把熨斗放在火炉上加热，再拿起另一个放在火炉上的熨斗，用手指试了试温度，又把它放了回去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">While Big Ma waited for the iron to get hot. I could see Mama bending over outspread newspapers scraping the dried mud off the old field shoes of Papa's which she wore daily, stuffed with wads of newspaper, over her own shoes to protect them from the mud and rain. Little Man beside her was deep into his first-grade reader, his eyebrows furrowed in concentration. Ever since Mama had brought the reader home with the offensive inside cover no longer visible, Little Man had accepted the book as a necessary tool for passing the first grade. But he took no pride in it. Looking up. he noticed that Big Ma was now preparing to iron his clothes, and he smiled happily, Then his eyes met mine and silent laughter creased his face. I muffled a giggle and Mama looked up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在奶奶等待着熨斗变烫的过程里，我看到妈妈把爸爸平时穿的旧鞋放在摊开的报纸上，清理掉上面风干后的泥巴，然后把另一张报纸盖在自己的鞋子上，以免被泥巴和雨水弄脏。小家伙坐在她旁边，皱着眉头看着他的一年级课本。自从妈妈把他课本上让人觉得受到侮辱的那页用白纸粘起来之后，他就把它当作一本正常的书来看了，不过他也没觉得拥有这本书是多自豪的事情。他抬头看到奶奶正在准备熨他明天要穿的衣服，愉悦地笑了。他的视线与我相遇，脸上又浮现出会心的微笑。我又忍不住“扑哧”一笑，妈妈抬起了头。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I heard the door to the boys' room open and close and I knew that Mama had gone in. I waited for the sound of the door opening again, but it did not come. Soon the chill of the cotton sheets beneath me began to fade and as Big Ma's presence lulled me into a security I did not really feel, I fell asleep.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着，我听到男孩们的房间门开了又关，开了又关，妈妈一定是到他们房间里去了。我等待着门再次被打开，却一直没有听到。被窝渐渐变暖，再加上奶奶的陪伴，我渐渐进入了梦乡。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Laughing silently at myself, I hurried onto the porch. "Stacey," I whispered. "Christopher-John?" There was a sudden movement near the end of the porch and I headed to- ward it, feeling along the wall of the house. "Little Man! Hey, y'all, stop fooling 'round and answer me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="暗笑自己胆小，我跑到了前廊。“斯泰西？”我轻声喊，“克里斯托弗吗？”前廊尽头突然有个黑影在晃动，我扶着墙壁向前走去，“小家伙吗？别吓唬我啦，快点出来。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Outside, an owl hooted into the night, quiet now except for the drip-drap of water falling from the roof. I stood transfixed by the chair, afraid to move.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="屋外，只有猫头鹰的叫声和滴滴答答的雨声。我站在椅子旁，害怕得一动也不敢动。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I crept precariously near the edge of the high porch, my eyes attempting to penetrate the blackness of the night. From below, a scratchy bristlyness sprang upon me, and I lost my balance and tumbled with a thud into the muddy flower bed. I lay paralyzed with fear. Then a long wet tongue licked my face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我弓着腰沿着边缘走着，集中精力在黑暗中寻找着。突然传来了抓挠的声响，有个身影猛地朝我扑了过来，我一下子失去平衡，整个人摔倒在花圃里，动弹不得。然后我感到有什么长长的东西在舔我的脸。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When I awoke, it was still nightly dark. "Big Ma!" I called. "Big Ma, you there!" But there was no reply from the chair by the window. Thinking that Big Ma had fallen asleep, I climbed from the bed and felt my way to her chair. She wasn't there.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当我醒来时，屋里依然是一片漆黑。“奶奶？”我呼唤着，“奶奶，你在吗？”但窗边并没有传来回答。奶奶是睡着了吧？我摸黑走到窗户边，发现奶奶不在那里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then I heard a noise on the porch. I could not control my trembling. Again the noise, this time close to the door, and it occurred to me that it was probably the boys coming to confer with me. No doubt Mama had left them alone too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着我听到前廊传来了声响，我又忍不住吓得发抖。声音再次响起，而且更靠近门边。或许是男孩们过来要和我商量事情吧。毫无疑问，妈妈已经离开他们的房间了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Jason? Jason, that you!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“杰森？杰森是你吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I hugged him, then instantly let him go. "Was that you all the time! Look what you gone and done," I fussed, thinking of the mess I was in with mud all over me.</div>

<div class="line_en">Jason whined again and I got up. I started to climb back up onto the porch but froze as a caravan of headlights appeared suddenly in the east, coming fast along the rain-soaked road like cat eyes in the night. Jason whined loudly, growing skittish as the lights approached, and when they slowed and braked before the house he slunk beneath the porch. I wanted to follow, but I couldn't. My legs would not move.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杰森又叫了几声。我站起来，准备爬回前廊时，看到眼前的景象，一下子僵住了。一列开着灯的车队，正朝着我们家的方向驶来，一路颠簸的车灯就像黑夜中闪烁的猫眼。杰森看到这些车，一阵狂吠。可是当车子减速在我家门前停下来时，它却吓得躲了回去。我也想跟杰森一样躲起来，可我的脚已经僵住了，动弹不得。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The driver of the next car got out, waiting. The first man stopped and stared at the house for several long moments as if uncertain whether it was the correct destination. Then he shook his head, and without a word returned to his car. With a wave of his hand he sent the other driver back in- side, and in less than a minute the lead car had backed into the road, its headlights facing the other cars. Each of the cars used the driveway to turn around, then the caravan sped away as swiftly as it had come, its seven pairs of rear lights glowing like distant red embers until they were swallowed from view by the Granger forest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二辆车的人也下来了。不过他站在原地。第一个下车的人，在房子前看了好一会儿，似乎不确定这是不是他们要找的地方。接着，他摇了摇头，一言不发地走回他的车子。他挥挥手示意另一个人也上车。没过多久，那七辆车都离开了，消失在夜幕中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The lead car swung into the muddy driveway and a shadowy figure outlined by the headlights of the car behind him stepped out. The man walked slowly up the drive.</div>

<div class="line_en">Jason began barking now that the danger had passed, but he did not come out. As I reached for the porch to steady myself, there was a sense of quiet movement in the dark- ness. The moon slid from its dark covers, cloaking the earth in a shadowy white light, and I could see Mr. Morrison clearly, moving silently, like a jungle cat, from the side of the house to the road, a shotgun in his hand. Feeling sick, I crawled onto the porch and crept trembling toward the door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="车队离开后，杰森又开始狂吠，不过它依然躲在后头没出来。周围一片黑暗，异常宁静。月光透过乌云发出白色的光芒，洒落在黝黑的大地上。我清楚地看见莫里森先生，像只树林里的猫，悄无声息地出现在房子旁边，然后走向马路，手里还握着一把短枪。我心生恐惧，赶紧爬了回去，颤抖着走回门边。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Once inside the house, I leaned against the latch while waves of sick terror swept over me. Realizing that I must get into bed before Mama or Big Ma came from the other room. I pulled off my muddy clothes, turning them inside out to wipe the mud from my body, and put on my night clothes. Then I climbed into the softness of the bed. I lay very still for a while, not allowing myself to think. But soon, against my will, the vision of ghostly headlights soaked into my mind and an uncontrollable trembling racked my body. And it remained until the dawn, when I fell into a restless sleep.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="回到屋里，我靠在门上，大口地喘着气，以平息心头的恐惧。我突然意识到，要在被妈妈和奶奶发现前赶紧回到床上，可我身上现在满是泥巴。我脱下衣服，把里面翻到外面，把身上的泥巴擦掉。然后我爬上床，静静地躺着，努力不让自己回想刚才见到的场景。可我无法控制自己，那恐怖的车灯一直浮现在脑海里。我浑身发着抖，一直等到天亮才迷迷糊糊地睡着了。">查看中文翻译</div>
