<div class="line_en">You don't know about me if you haven't read a book called The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. Mr Mark Twain wrote the book and most of it is true. In that book robbers stole some money and hid it in a very secret place in the woods. But Tom Sawyer and I found it, and after that we were rich. We got six thousand dollars each -- all gold.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果你没有看过《汤姆·索亚历险记》那本书，你就不知道我。这本书是马克·吐温写的，大部分是真实的。在那本书中，强盗们偷了钱，并把钱藏在了树林中一个很秘密的地方。但我和汤姆·索亚找到了这笔钱，在这之后，我们发财了。我们每个人得到了6000美元——全是金币。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In those days I never had a home or went to school like Tom and all the other boys in St Petersburg. Pop was always drunk, and he moved around a lot, so he wasn't a very good father. But it didn't matter to me. I slept in the streets or in the woods, and I could do what I wanted, when I wanted. It was a fine life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在那些日子里，我从来没有一个家，或是像汤姆和圣彼得斯堡所有其他的男孩那样去上学。爸爸总是喝得醉醺醺的，经常转来转去，所以，他不是一个很好的父亲。但是，这对我来说无所谓。我睡在街上或林子里，只要我想做，我就能做我想做的事情。这真是一种美好的生活。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When we got all that money, Tom and I were famous for a while. Judge Thatcher, who was an important man in our town, kept my money in the bank for me. And the Widow Douglas took me to live in her house and said I could be her son. She was very nice and kind, but it was a hard life because I had to wear new clothes and be good all the time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当我和汤姆得到所有那些钱时，我们出了一阵子名。撒切尔法官是我们镇子上的一个重要人物，他替我将钱存在了银行。道格拉斯寡妇领我到她家去住，并说我可以做她的儿子。她非常和蔼，但这是一种令人难以忍受的生活，因为我不得不穿新衣服，而且始终都要听话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the end, I put on my old clothes and ran away. But Tom came after me and said that I had to go back, but that I could be in his gang of robbers. So, I went back, and the widow cried and I had to put on those new clothes again. I didn't like it at all. Her sister, Miss Watson, lived there too. She was always saying, "Don't put your feet there, Huckleberry," and "Don't do that, Huckleberry." It was terrible.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后，我穿上我的旧衣服跑掉了。可汤姆追上了我说，我得回去，但我仍可以加入他的强盗团伙。所以，我回去了，寡妇叫着，我不得不又穿上那些新衣服。我根本不喜欢这一切。她的姐姐沃森小姐也住在那儿。她总是说，“别把你的脚放在那儿，哈克贝利，”还有“别干那个，哈克贝利。”真是糟透了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When I went up to bed that night, I sat down in a chair by the window. I sat there a good long time, and I was really unhappy. But just after midnight I heard "mee-yow! mee-yow!" outside. Very softly, I answered, "mee-yow! mee-yor!" Quietly, I put out the light and got out through the window. In the trees, Tom Sawyer was waiting for me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天晚上，上床睡觉的时候，我坐在窗边的椅子上。我坐了很久，真是很难受。但是，午夜刚过，我听到外面“喵！喵！”的声音。我很轻地回答着“喵！瞄！”。我轻轻地吹灭蜡烛，从窗户钻了出去。汤姆·索亚正在树丛中等我。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We went through the trees to the end of the widow's garden. Soon we were on top of a hill on the other side of the house. Below us we could see the river and the town. One or two lights were still on, but everything was quiet. We went down the hill and found Joe Harper, Ben Rogers and two or three more of the boys. Then Tom took us down the river by boat to his secret place, which was a cave deep in the side of a hill. When we got there, Tom told us all his plan.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们穿过树丛来到寡妇的花园的尽头。不一会儿，我们就到了房子另一头的一个小山顶上。我们能看到山下的小河和镇子。一两处烛光仍亮着，但是，万物都是静悄悄的。我们下了山，找到了乔·哈珀，本·罗杰斯，还有两三个其他的男孩。然后，汤姆用船把我们带到了那个秘密的地方，这个秘密的地方是山坡深处的一个岩洞。当我们到那时，汤姆把他的全部计划告诉了我们。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Now, we'll have this gang of robbers," he said, "and we'll call it Tom Sawyer's Gang. If somebody hurts one of us, the others will kill him and his family. And if a boy from the gang tells other people our secrets, we'll kill him and his family, too."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“现在，我们就来组织这个强盗团伙，”他说，“我们就叫它汤姆·索亚团伙吧。如果有人伤害我们中的某个人，其他的人就要杀了他和他的全家。如果这个团伙的哪个男孩把我们的秘密告诉了其他人，我们也要把他和他的全家都给杀喽。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Nothing," replied Tom. "Just rob and kill. We stop people on the road, and we kill them, and take their money and things. But we can keep a few of the people, and then their friends can pay money to get them back. That's what they do in the stories in books."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“什么都不干，”汤姆回答道，“只是抢劫和杀人，我们在路上拦截人，杀了他们，拿走他们的钱和东西。但是，我们可以留下几个人，这佯，他们的朋友可以交钱把他们赎回去。这就是人们在书中故事里所做的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">My clothes were very dirty and I was very tired when I got back. Of course, the next morning Miss Watson was angry with me because of my dirty clothes, but the widow just looked unhappy. Soon after that we stopped playing robbers because we never robbed people and we never killed them.</div>
