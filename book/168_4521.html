<div class="line_en">At Maidenpool, Lord Mooton's red salmon still flew above the castle on its hill, but the town walls were deserted, the gates smashed, half the homes and shops burned or plundered. They saw nothing living but a few feral dogs that went slinking away at the sound of their approach. The pool from which the town took its name, where legend said that Florian the Fool had first glimpsed jonquil bathing with her sisters, was so choked with rotting corpses that the water had turned into a murky grey-green soup.</div>

<div class="line_en">He could never bear to be long apart from his twin. Even as children, they would creep into each other's beds and sleep with their arms entwined. Even in the womb. Long before his sister's flowering or the advent of his own manhood, they had seen mares and stallions in the fields and dogs and bitches in the kennels and played at doing the same. Once their mother's maid had caught them at it… he did not recall just what they had been doing, but whatever it was had horrified Lady Joanna. She'd sent the maid away, moved Jaime's bedchamber to the other side of Casterly Rock, set a guard outside Cersei's, and told them that they must never do that again or she would have no choice but to tell their lord father. They need not have feared, though. It was not long after that she died birthing Tyrion. Jaime barely remembered what his mother had looked like.</div>

<div class="line_en">Jaime had decided that he would return Sansa, and the younger girl as well if she could be found. It was not like to win him back his lost honor, but the notion of keeping faith when they all expected betrayal amused him more than he could say.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="詹姆打定主意，定要归还珊莎，如果可能，连她妹妹一起还。这当然不是为赢得什么狗屁荣誉，但众人皆以为他反复无常，他却偏要恪守信誓，感觉多么美妙！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Perhaps Stannis Baratheon and the Starks had done him a kindness. They had spread their tale of incest all over the Seven Kingdoms, so there was nothing left to hide. Why shouldn't I marry Cersei openly and share her bed every night? The dragons always married their sisters. Septons, lords, and smallfolk had turned a blind eye to the Targaryens for hundreds of years, let them do the same for House Lannister. It would play havoc with Joffrey's claim to the crown, to be sure, but in the end it had been swords that had won the iron Throne for Robert, and swords could keep Joffrey there as well, regardless of whose seed he was. We could marry him to Myrcella, once we've sent Sansa Stark back to her mother. That would show the realm that the Lannisters are above their laws, like gods and Targaryens.</div>

<div class="line_en">Jaime's gelding lumbered off ponderously, blowing and snorting in pain. He craned around to look for Brienne. She was still ahorse, an arrow lodged in her back and another in her leg, but she seemed not to feel them. He saw her pull her sword and wheel in a circle, searching for the bowmen. "Behind the wall," Jaime called, fighting to turn his halfblind mount back toward the fight. The reins were tangled in his damned chains, and the air was full of arrows again. "At them!" he shouted, kicking to show her how it was done. The old sorry horse found a burst of speed from somewhere. Suddenly they were racing across the wheatfield, throwing up clouds of chaff. Jaime had just enough time to think, The wench had better follow before they realize they're being charged by an unarmed man in chains. Then he heard her coming hard behind. "Evenfall!" she shouted as her plow horse thundered by. She brandished her longsword. "Tarth! Tarth!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="詹姆的老白马盲目地转圈，因疼痛而喘气。他四下搜寻布蕾妮，发现她还在马上，虽然背上和腿上各中了一箭，但似乎并不在意。她拔出武器，挽个剑花，搜寻弓箭手。“墙后面！”詹姆叫道，努力改变瞎马的方向。该死的镣铐，缠住了缰绳，空中又有飞箭之声。“冲啊！”他猛力踢马，朝它咆哮，费尽九牛二虎之力，才让这匹老苯马跑起来。他俩冲过麦田，撞断无数稻穗。詹姆心中暗自惴惴：妞儿得跟紧我，否则教土匪们知道一个毫无武装，全身镣铐的人自动上门那可不妙！接着他听见她沉重的呼吸，“暮临厅万岁！”犁马轰隆跑过，她高声呐喊，挥舞着长剑，“塔斯万岁！塔斯万岁！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They were riding past a trampled wheatfield and a low stone wall when Jaime heard a soft thrum from behind, as if a dozen birds had taken flight at once. "Down!" he shouted, throwing himself against the neck of his horse. The gelding screamed and reared as an arrow took him in the rump. other shafts went hissing past. Jaime saw Ser Cleos lurch from the saddle, twisting as his foot caught in the stirrup. His palfrey bolted, and Frey was dragged past shouting, head bouncing against the ground.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="骑行在一片遭践踏的麦田里，穿过一道低矮的石墙，詹姆听见背后“嗖”地一声轻响，十几只鸟儿展翅腾空。“快伏下！”他大吼，边把头紧贴马脖子。说时迟那时快，飞箭没入马臀，坐骑尖叫人立。另几只箭飞向前方，克里奥爵士一头从鞍上栽下，脚还在镫里，马则拼命狂奔，牵动佛雷的头颅和地面碰撞，惨叫声不绝于耳。">查看中文翻译</div>

As the blade slid from the scabbard, he was already pivoting, bringing the sword around and up in a swift deadly arc. Steel met steel with a ringing, bone-jarring clang. Somehow Brienne had gotten her own blade out in time. Jaime laughed. "Very good, wench."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh, I will." He sprang to his feet and drove at her, the longsword alive in his hands. Brienne jumped back, parrying, but he followed, pressing the attack. No sooner did she turn one cut than the next was upon her. The swords kissed and sprang apart and kissed again. Jaime's blood was singing. This was what he was meant for; he never felt so alive as when he was fighting, with death balanced on every stroke. And with my wrists chained together, the wench may even give me a contest for a time. His chains forced him to use a two-handed grip, though of course the weight and reach were less than if the blade had been a true two-handed greatsword, but what did it matter?

One of her slashes raked across his brow, and blood ran down into his right eye. The Others take her, and Riverrun as well! His skills had gone to rust and rot in that bloody dungeon, and the chains were no great help either. His eye closed, his shoulders were going numb from the jarring they'd taken, and his wrists ached from the weight of chains, manacles, and sword.

<div class="line_en">"Shout it a little louder, wench, I don't think Urswyck heard you. The sooner they know how little you're worth in ransom, the sooner the rapes begin. Every man here will mount you, but what do you care? just close your eyes, open your legs, and pretend they're all Lord Renly."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“大声点，妞儿，让乌斯威克听见才好咧。等他们知道你有多不值钱，你的身体就保不住了。每个人都会来骑你，你呢？只好闭上眼睛，张开大腿，假装个个都是蓝礼大人。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mercifully, that shut her mouth for a time.</div>

<div class="line_en">The day was almost done by the time they found Vargo Hoat, sacking a small sept with another dozen of his Brave Companions. The leaded windows had been smashed, the carved wooden gods dragged out into the sunlight. The fattest Dothraki Jaime had ever seen was sitting on the Mother's chest when they rode up, prying out her chalcedony eyes with the point of his knife. Nearby, a skinny balding septon hung upside down from the limb of a spreading chestnut tree. Three of the Brave Companions were using his corpse for an archery butt. One of them must have been good; the dead man had arrows through both of his eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="遇到瓦格·霍特的时候，天色已晚，山羊手下十来个“勇士”正在洗劫一座小圣堂。镶铅玻璃被砸碎，木雕神像拖了出来，一个詹姆毕生所见最为肥胖的多斯拉克人坐在圣母的胸膛上，用匕首挖神像的玉髓眼睛。在他旁边，有个骨瘦如柴的秃头修士被头下脚上地吊在栗树枝头，三名勇士团的成员正拿尸体当箭靶。箭法不错，死人双眼皆穿。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Dornishman Timeon and a foul-smelling Ibbenese pulled Jaime down from the saddle and shoved him roughly toward the cookfire. It would not have been hard for him to have grasped one of their sword hilts as they manhandled him, but there were too many, and he was still in fetters. He might cut down one or two, but in the end he would die for it. Jaime was not ready to die just yet, and certainly not for the likes of Brienne of Tarth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="多恩人提蒙和一个浑身臭气的伊班人将詹姆从马上拖下来，推到篝火边。两个狗奴才，他可以夺下他俩的剑，但对方人数实在太多，他则带着镣铐，最多砍倒一两个，然后白白送命。詹姆还不想死，至少不想为塔斯的布蕾妮而死。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Rorge dragged her off the horse and began to kick her. "See that you don't break any bones," Urswyck called out to him. "The horse-faced bitch is worth her weight in sapphires."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="罗尔杰将她拖下马猛踢。“别伤筋动骨，”乌斯威克提醒，“这马脸婊子能换蓝宝石。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When the sellswords spied Urswyck and the captives, a cry went up in half a dozen tongues. The goat was seated by a cookflre eating a half-cooked bird off a skewer, grease and blood running down his fingers into his long stringy beard. He wiped his hands on his tunic and rose. "Kingthlayer," he slobbered. "You are my captifth."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="佣兵们发现乌斯威克的队伍，发出零落地欢呼。山羊本人坐在篝火边，就着叉子吃烤得半生不熟的鸟儿，油脂和鲜血流过指头，淌进粗糙的长须里。他用衣服擦擦手，站起身来。“四君者，”他唾沫横飞地说，“你是我的俘乳了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Coins from every land where he has fought, Jaime remembered. Greed was the key to this man. If he was turned once, he can be turned again. "Lord Vargo, you were foolish to leave my father's service, but it is not too late to make amends. He will pay well for me, you know it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是他游历世界各地，靠刀剑买生活的证明，詹姆很明白。此人的弱点是贪婪。他既倒戈过一次，也会倒戈第二次。“瓦格大人，您遗弃我父亲真是太遗憾了，不过咱们和解还不晚。您知道，他很看重我。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh yeth," said Vargo Hoat. "Half the gold in Cathterly Rock, I thall have. But firth I mutht thend him a methage." He said something in his slithery goatish tongue.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“噢，补错，”瓦格·霍特道。“我棵以得到，全开岩城的金子。但手先，我要松他一个心物。”他用山羊般的语调口齿不清地说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Thith ith a thweet day," Vargo Hoat said. Around his neck hung a chain of linked coins, coins of every shape and size, cast and hammered, bearing the likenesses of kings, wizards, gods and demons, and all manner of fanciful beasts.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“斤天是个嚎日子。”瓦格·霍特说。在他脖子上，有一根钱币串成的项链，它们的大小、形状、材料和作工各不相同，描绘着国王、巫师、神灵、魔鬼几各种珍禽异兽。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Urswyck shoved him in the back, and a jester in green and pink motley kicked his legs out from under him. When he hit the ground one of the archers grabbed the chain between Jaime's wrists and used it to yank his arms out in front of him. The fat Dothraki put aside his knife to unsheathe a huge curved arakh, the wickedly sharp scythe-sword the horselords loved.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="乌斯威克将一推，另一个穿绿粉小丑装的人朝腿踢去，使他趴倒在地，一名弓箭手抓起铁镣，将他手臂拉到前面。肥胖的多斯拉克人放下匕首，抽出一把巨大的亚拉克弯刀，那是马族惯用的镰刀状利器。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They mean to scare me. The fool hopped on Jaime's back, giggling, as the Dothraki swaggered toward him. The goat wants me to piss my breeches and beg his mercy, but he'll never have that pleasure. He was a Lannister of Casterly Rock, Lord Commander of the Kingsguard; no sellsword would make him scream.</div>
