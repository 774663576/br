<div class="line_en">We arrived at Stazione Termini around 7 p. m. on a Wednesday evening. The air was thick and muggy, as if Rome had been awash in a rainstorm that had come and gone and relieved none of the dampness. With dusk scarcely an hour away, the streetlights glistened through dense halos, while the lighted storefronts seemed doused in gleaming colors of their own invention. Dampness clung to every forehead and every face. I wanted to caress his face. I couldn't wait to get to our hotel and shower and throw myself on the bed, knowing all the while that, unless we had good air-conditioning, I'd be no better off after the shower. But I also loved the languor that sat upon the city, like a lover's tired, unsteady arm resting on your shoulders.</div>

<div class="line_en">Oliver wanted to take the first taxi. I wanted to take a bus instead. I longed for crowded buses. I wanted to go into a bus, wedge my way into the sweating mass of people, with him pushing his way behind me. But seconds after hopping on the bus, we decided to get out. This was too real, we joked. I backed out through the incoming press of infuriated home-goers who couldn't understand what we were doing. I managed to step on a woman's foot. "E non cbiede manco scusa, doesn't even say he's sorry," she hissed to those around her who had just jostled their way into the bus and were not letting us squeeze out.</div>

<div class="line_en">To our delight the larger of our adjoining bedrooms had both a balcony and a window, and when we opened the French windows, the glistening domes of numberless churches reflected the setting sun in the vast, unencumbered vista below us. Someone had sent us a bunch of flowers and a bowl filled with fruit. The note came from Oliver's Italian publisher: "Come to the bookstore around eight-thirty. Bring your manuscript. There's a party for one of our authors. Ti aspettiamo, we're awaiting you."</div>

<div class="line_en">These words, spoken from a height of bliss it seemed no one could steal from us, would take me back to this hotel room and to this damp ferragosto evening as both of us leaned stark-naked with our arms on the windowsill, overlooking an unbearably hot Roman late-late afternoon, both of us still smelling of the stuffy compartment on the southbound train that was probably nearing Naples by now and on which we'd slept, my head resting on his in full view of the other passengers. Leaning out into the evening air, I knew that this might never be given to us again, and yet I couldn't bring^ myself to believe it. He too must have had the same thought as we surveyed the magnificent cityscape, smoking and eating fresh figs, shoulder to shoulder, each wanting to do something to mark the moment, which was why, yielding to an impulse that couldn't have felt more natural at the time, I let my left hand rub his buttocks and then began to stick my middle finger into him as he replied, "You keep doing this, and there's definitely no party." I told him to do me a favor and keep staring out the window but to lean forward a bit, until I had a brainstorm once my entire finger was inside him: we might start but under no condition would we finish. Then we'd shower and go out and feel like two exposed, live wires giving off sparks each time they so much as flicked each other. Look at old houses and want to hug each one, spot a lamppost on a street corner and, like a dog, want to spray it, pass an art gallery and look for the hole in the nude, cross a face that did no more than smile our way and already initiate moves to undress the whole person and ask her, or him, or both, if they were more than one, to join us first for drinks, for dinner, anything. Find Cupid everywhere in Rome because we'd clipped one of his wings and he was forced to fly in circles.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在似乎没人能从我们手中夺走的幸福顶点上说的这些话，把我带回这个旅馆房间，回到现实世界中这个潮湿的圣母升天节①傍晚，我们浑身光溜溜，双双把手臂靠在窗台，俯瞰热到令人吃不消的罗马黄昏，两人身上残留着南下列车里的沉闷气味。在车上，我在其他乘客的睽睽众目之下头靠着他的头跟他一起睡，此时火车或许快到那不勒斯了吧。探出身子贴近傍晚的空气，我知道这或许是我们绝无仅有的机会，却无法说服自己相信。眺望城市美景的时候，他必定也有同样的想法，肩并肩，抽烟，吃无花果，各自都想做些什么为这一刻留下记号，因此，我屈服于当时显得再自然不过的冲动…旋即突发奇想：我们可以开始，但决不结束。接着我们要冲澡，然后出门，感觉像两条裸露且通电的电线，只要彼此轻触就会冒出火花。罗马处处可见丘比特，因为我们剪了他一只翅膀，逼得他不得不兜圈子飞。【注：①圣母升天节（ferragosto）：于八月十五日庆祝的意大利节日，原本是庆祝盛夏与农忙结束的日子，后来罗马天主教来用这一天当作圣母升天节。通常在这个节日前后会放约两周到一个月的长假，意大利人利用这段时间去度假，是罗马一年中人烟最稀少的时候。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He said he was going to take a shower. When I saw him naked I immediately got undressed as well. "Just for a second," I said as our bodies touched, for I loved the dampness that clung all over his. "I wish you didn't have to wash." His smell reminded me of Marzia's, and how she too always seemed to exude that brine of the seashore on those days when there isn't a breeze on the beaches and all you smell is the raw, ashen scent of scalding sand. I loved the salt of his arms, of his shoulders, along the ridges of his spine. They were still new to me. "If we lie down now, there'll be no book party," he said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他说他要冲个澡。我看他脱光，也立刻褪下衣服。“一会儿就好。”身体接触时我说，因为我喜欢他浑身的湿气。“但愿你不必洗澡。”他的气味让我想起玛琪雅的味道。海边无风、只闻得到灼热沙子原始死白味道的日子里，玛琪雅似乎总散发出海边的咸水味。我喜欢他手臂、肩膀、背脊上的曲线。这些对我来说还很新鲜。“如果我们现在躺下，新书发表会就泡汤了。”他说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I wanted no secrets, no screens, nothing between us. Little did I know that if I relished the gust of candor that bound us tighter each time we swore my body is your body, it was also because I enjoyed rekindling the tiny lantern of unsuspected shame. It cast a spare glow precisely where part of me would have preferred the dark. Shame trailed instant intimacy. Could intimacy endure once indecency was spent and our bodies had run out of tricks?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我希望我们之间没有秘密，没有帘幕，什么都没有。这时我还不明了，若我享受每次我们向彼此誓言“我的身体就是你的身体”时，那份随之而来、令我们结合得更紧密的坦诚，那也是因为我同时欣赏着重又点燃的、意外来到的羞耻之火。这火光恰好在我宁可保持黑暗的地方投射出一道光辉。羞耻紧跟着刹那的亲密而来。一旦猥亵用尽，我们的身体再也没有戏法可变，亲密还能持久吗？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We had never taken a shower together. We had never even been in the same bathroom together. "Don't flush," I'd said, "I want to look." What I saw brought out strains of compassion, for him, for his body, for his life, which suddenly seemed so frail and vulnerable. "Our bodies won't have secrets now," I said as I took my turn and sat down. He had hopped into the bathtub and was just about to turn on the shower. "I want you to see mine," I said. He did more. He stepped out, kissed me on the mouth, and, pressing and massaging my tummy with the flat of his palm, watched the whole thing happen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们从来没有一起冲过澡。甚至不曾同时共用浴室。“别冲，我想看。”我看到的，令我对他、对他的身体、对他的生活，产生怜悯的感觉，他的各方面突然显得脆弱而易受伤害。“我们的身体不再有秘密了。”轮到我时，我边坐下边说。他跳进浴缸，正准备扭开莲蓬头。“我要你看我的。”我说。但他更进一步。他跨出浴缸，吻我的嘴，以手掌按摩我下腹，目睹整个过程。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Along the way we caught sight of a human statue of Dante cloaked in red with an exaggerated aquiline nose and the most scornful frown limned on all his features. The red toga and the red bell cap and the thick-rimmed wooden spectacles gave his already stern face the wizened look of an implacable father confessor. A crowd had gathered around the great bard, who stood motionless on the pavement, his arms crossed defiantly, the whole body standing erect, like a man waiting for Virgil or for an overdue bus. As soon as a tourist threw a coin into a hollowed-out, antique book, he simulated the besotted air of a Dante who's just spied his Beatrice ambling across the Ponte Vecchio and, craning his cobralike neck, would right away moan out, like a street performer spitting fire,</div>

<div class="line_en">I had already told him the story. A young man on a bicycle three years ago, probably a grocer's helper or errand boy, riding down a narrow path with his apron on, staring me straight in the face, as I stared back, no smile, just a troubled look, till he passed me by. And then I did what I always hope others might do in such cases. I waited a few seconds, then turned around. He-had done the exact same thing. I don't come from a family where you speak to strangers. He clearly did. He whisked the bicycle around and pedaled until he caught up with me. A few insignificant words uttered to make light conversation. How easily it came to him. Questions, questions, questions -- just to keep the words flowing -- while I didn't even have breath to utter "yes" or "no." He shook my hand but clearly as an excuse to hold it. Then put his arm around me and pressed me to him, as if we were sharing a joke that had made us laugh and drawn us closer. Did I want to get together in a nearby movie house, perhaps? I shook my head. Did I want to follow him to the store -- boss was most likely gone by this time in the evening. Shook my head again. Are you shy? I nodded. All this without letting go of my hand, squeezing my hand, squeezing my shoulder, rubbing the nape of my neck with a patronizing and forgiving smile, as if he'd already given up but wasn't willing to call it quits just yet. Why not? he kept asking. I could have -- easily -- I didn't.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我对他说过那件事。三年前，某个或许是食品杂货商助手或跑腿的年轻单车骑士，穿着围裙骑车顺着狭窄的路来，他直勾勾盯着我的脸看，我不带笑容，以困扰的表情回瞪他，直到他与我擦身而过。接着我做了一件我一直希望别人遇到这种情况会做的事。我等了几秒，然后转过身。他也做了一模一样的事。我的家教并未教我怎么跟陌生人搭汕，他则显然是。他很快掉过头来，骑车追上我，吐出几句无足轻重的话，想聊点轻松的话题。这对他来说多么不容易啊。问题，问题，问题——只是为了不让话题中断，我却连吐出个“是”或“不是”的一口气都没有。他跟我握手，但那显然只是想握住我的手的借口。接着他伸出一只手臂环着我，搂紧，仿佛我们在分享一个让我们拉近彼此距离的笑话。问我想不想一起去附近的电影院？我摇摇头。问我想不想跟他去店里——傍晚这时候，老板很可能已经走了。我再度摇头。你害羞吗？我点头。他一直没放开我的手，带着一抹施恩与宽恕的微笑，紧握我的手，紧搂我的肩膀，摩擦我的颈背，好像他已经放弃，却仍不愿意就此打住。“为什么不要？”他继续问。我或许能够（轻易）接受，但我没有。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Via Frattina, via Borgognona, via Condotti, via delle Car-rozze, della Croce, via Vittoria. Suddenly I loved them all. As we approached the bookstore, Oliver said I should go along, he'd just make a quick local phone call. He could have called from the hotel. Or perhaps he needed privacy. So I kept walking, stopping at a local bar to buy cigarettes. When I reached the bookstore with its large glass door and two clay Roman busts sitting on two seemingly antique stumps, I suddenly got nervous. The place was packed, and through the thick glass door, with spare bronze trimming around it, you could make out a throng of adults, all of them eating what appeared to be petits fours. Someone inside saw me peering into the store and signaled me to come in. I shook my head, indicating with a hesitant index finger that I was waiting for someone who was just coming up this road here. But the owner, or his assistant, like a club manager, without stepping down on the sidewalk, pushed the glass door wide open with his arm totally extended and held it there, almost ordering me to come in. "Venga, su, venga!" he said, the sleeves of his shirt rakishly rolled up to his shoulders. The reading had not started yet but the bookstore was filled to capacity, everyone smoking, chatting loudly, leafing through new books, each holding a tiny plastic cup with what looked like scotch whiskey. Even the upstairs gallery, whose banister was lined with the bare elbows and forearms of women, was tightly packed. I recognized the author right away. He was the same man who had signed both Marzia's and my copy of his book of poems, Se l'amore, He was shaking several hands.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Tristia" took up the better part of twenty minutes. Then came the applause. The word one of the two girls used was forte. Molto forte. The goitered toucan turned to another woman who had never stopped nodding at almost every syllable spoken by the poet and who now kept repeating, Straordinario-fantastico. The poet stepped down, took a glass of water, and held his breath for a while -- to get rid of a bad case of hiccups. I had mistaken his hiccups for suppressed sobs. The poet, looking into all the pockets of his sports jacket and coming out empty, joined his index and middle fingers tightly together and, waving both fingers next to his mouth, signaled to the bookstore owner that he wanted to smoke and maybe mingle for a couple of minutes. Straordinario-fantastico, who intercepted his signal, instantly produced her cigarette case. "Stasera non dormo, tonight I won't be able to sleep, the wages of poetry," she said, blaming his poetry for what was sure to be a night of throbbing insomnia.</div>

We were leaving in three days -- and then whatever I had with Oliver was destined to go up in thin air. We had talked about meeting in the States, and we had talked of writing and speaking by phone-but the whole thing had a mysteriously surreal quality kept intentionally opaque by both of us -- not because we wanted to allow events to catch us unprepared so that we might blame circumstances and not ourselves, but because by not planning to keep things alive, we were avoiding the prospect that they might ever die. We had come to Rome in the same spirit of avoidance: Rome was a final bash before school and travel took us away, just a way of putting things off and extending the party long past closing time. Perhaps, without thinking, we had taken more than a brief vacation; we were eloping together with return-trip tickets to separate destinations.</div>

Then that they were unspeakably sweet, sweet as you can't imagine anyone being sweet here. Oh, we can be kind and we can be caring and we can be very, very warm in our sunny, passionate Mediterranean way, but they were sweet, selflessly sweet, sweet in their hearts, sweet in their bodies, sweet without a touch of sorrow or malice, sweet like children, without irony or shame. I was ashamed of what I felt for them. This could be paradise, just as I'd fantasized. The twenty-four-year-old night clerk of my rinky-dink hotel, who's wearing a visorless cap and has seen all types come and go, stares and I stare back. His features are a girl's. But he looks like a girl who looks like a boy. The girl at the American Express desk stares and I stare back. She looks like a boy who looks like a girl and who's therefore just a boy. The younger ones, men and women, always giggle when I give them the look. Even the girl at the consulate who speaks fluent Milanese, and the undergraduates who wait at the same hour of each and every morning for the same bus to pick us up, stare at me and I stare back -- does all this staring add up to what I think it means, because, like it or not, when it comes to the senses all humans speak the same beastly tongue."</div>

<div class="line_en">The poet: "Invigoration is not hard to come by in Bangkok. One warm night in my hotel room I thought I would go out of my mind. It was either loneliness, or the sounds of people outside, or the work of the devil. But this is when I began to think of San Clemente. It came to me like an undefined, nebulous feeling, part arousal, part homeisickness, part metaphor. You travel to a place because you have this picture of it and you want to couple with the whole country. Then you find that you and its natives haven't a thing in common. You don't understand the basic signals which you'd always assumed all humanity shared. You decide it was all a mistake, that it was all in your head. Then you dig a bit deeper and you find that, despite your reasonable suspicions, you still desire them all, but you don't know what it is exactly you want from them, or what they seem to want from you, because they too, it turns out, are all looking at you with what could only be one thing on their mind. But you tell yourself you're imagining things. And you're ready to pack up and go back to Rome because all of these touch-and-go signals are driving you mad. But then something suddenly clicks, like a secret underground passageway, and you realize that, just like you, they are desperate and aching for you as well. And the worst thing is that, with all your experience and your sense of irony and your ability to overcome shyness wherever it threatens to crop up, you feel totally stranded. I didn't know their language, didn't know the language of their hearts, didn't even know my own. I saw veils everywhere: what I wanted, what I didn't know I wanted, what I didn't want to know I wanted, what I'd always known I wanted. This is either a miracle. Or it is hell.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="诗人说：“在曼谷不难获得活力。有个温暖的晚上，我在旅馆房间里，还以为我就要发疯了。可能是寂寞，或外面的人声，或魔鬼作祟，我就是在这时候想到圣克雷芒。我有个念头，犹如不确定而难以捉摸的感觉，有些兴奋，有些想家，有些隐喻的成分。你到了一个地方，因为你脑中有那里的影像，你想与整个国家结合。接着你发现你和那儿土生土长的人没有任何交集。你不了解那些你一直假定是人类共有的基本信号。你认定一切都是错误，一切都是你的想象而已。接着你挖得更深一点，你发现尽管你的怀疑合理，但你还是想要这一切，却不确定你到底想从他们身上得到什么，或他们似乎想从你身上得到什么。因为到头来，他们也抱着唯一可能的同一种心思看你。但你告诉自己，这全是幻想。所有这一触即发的信号快要把你逼疯，于是你准备打包回罗马。但接下来，像走出秘密地下通道，你豁然开朗，发现他们跟你一样，也拼了命地渴望你。最糟的是，尽管你经验丰富，懂得反讽，能压抑自己的羞怯，却觉得动弹不得。我不懂他们的语言，不懂他们心里的语言，甚至不明白我自己的。我觉得到处都覆了一层纱：我想要的、我不知道我想要的、我不想知道我想要的、我始终知道我想要的…这若非奇迹，就是地狱。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I called it the San Clemente Syndrome. Today's Basilica of San Clemente is built on the site of what once was a refuge for persecuted Christians. The home of the Roman consul Titus Flavius Clemens, it was burnt down during Emperor Nero's reign. Next to its charred remains, in what must have been a large, cavernous vault, the Romans built an underground pagan temple dedicated to Mithras, God of the Morning, Light of the World, over whose temple the early Christians built another church, dedicated -- coincidentally or not, this is a matter to be further excavated -- to another Clement, Pope St. Clement, on top of which came yet another church that burnt down and on the site of which stands today's basilica. And the digging could go on and on. Like the subconscious, like love, like memory, like time itself, like every single one of us, the church is built on the ruins of subsequent restorations, there is no rock bottom, there is no first anything, no last anything, just layers and secret passageways and interlocking chambers, like the Christian Catacombs, and right along these, even a Jewish Catacomb.</div>

Clement 1，生于公元一世纪）：可能于88—97年或92—101年期间在位，据说他由圣彼得立为圣彼得之后的第三任主教。谣传他最后遭放逐到克里米亚，缚于铁锚上投入海中殉教，但无法确证。】">查看中文翻译</div>

He was now sitting at the very end of the table and he as well as those he had brought with him from the bookstore had been given the last of the cheeses remaining in the house.

<div class="line_en">It was well past one in the morning when the party arrived at Caffè Sant'Eustachio. We ordered coffees for everyone. I thought I understood why everyone swears by Sant'Eustachio's coffee; or perhaps I wanted to think I understood, but I wasn't sure. I wasn't even sure I liked it. Perhaps no one else did but felt obliged to fall in with the general opinion and claimed that they too couldn't live without it. There was a large crowd of coffee drinkers standing and sitting around the famed Roman coffeehouse. I loved watching all these lightly dressed people standing so close to me, all of them sharing the same basic thing: love for the night, love for the city, love for its people, and an ardent desire to couple -- with anyone. Love for anything that would prevent the tiny groups of people who had come together here from disbanding. After coffee, when the group considered separating, someone said, "No, we can't say goodbye yet." Someone suggested a pub nearby. Best beer in Rome. Why not? So we headed down a long and narrow side alley leading in the direction of Campo de' Fiori. Lucia walked between me and the poet. Oliver, talking with two of the sisters, was behind us. The old man had made friends with Straordinario-fantastico and they were both confabulating about San Clemente. "What a metaphor for life!" said Straordinario-fantastico. "Please! No need to overdo things either with clementification this and clementization that. It was just a figure of speech, you know," said Falstaff, who probably had had his fill of his godson's glory for the night. Noticing that Ada was walking by herself, I walked back and held her by the hand. She was dressed in white and her tanned skin had a sheen that made me want to touch every pore in her body. We did not speak. I could hear her high heels tapping the slate pavement. In the dark she seemed an apparition.</div>

<div class="line_en">As we ambled down an emptied labyrinth of sparely lit streets, I began to wonder what all this talk of San Clemente had to do with us -- how we move through time, how time moves through us, how we change and keep changing and come back to the same. One could even grow old and not learn a thing but this. That was the poet's lesson, I presume. In a month or so from now, when I'd revisit Rome, being here tonight with Oliver would seem totally unreal, as though it had happened to an entirely different me. And the wish born three years ago here when an errand boy offered to take me to a cheap movie theater known for what went on there would seem no less unfulfilled to me three months from now than it was three years ago. He came. He left. Nothing else had changed. I had not changed. The world hadn't changed. Yet nothing would be the same. All that remains is dreammaking and strange remembrance.</div>

The silent and deserted alley was altogether murky and its ancient, pockmarked cobblestones glistened in the damp air, as though an ancient carrier had spilled the viscous contents of his amphora before disappearing underground in the ancient city. Everyone had left Rome. And the emptied city, which had seen too many and seen them all, now belonged to us alone and to the poet who had cast it, if only for one night, in his own image. The mugginess was not going to break tonight. We could, if we wished, have walked in circles and no one would have known and none would have minded.</div>

Taverniere!" shouted Falstaff. The waiter told us that we could either have wine or beer; the bartender had left earlier that evening, on account of because his mother was taken gravely ill to the hospital where she had to be taken. Everyone smothered a laugh at the waiter's garbled speech. Oliver asked what they charged for martinis. The waiter yelled the question to the girl at the cash register. She told him how much.

<div class="line_en">When I was asked to play something else, I proposed a capriccio by Brahms. They all agreed it was a wonderful idea, until the devil took hold of me and, after playing the opening bars of the capriccio, out of nowhere I started to play a stornello. The contrast caught them all by surprise and all began to sing, though not in unison, for each sang the stornello he or she knew. Each time we came to the refrain, we agreed we'd all sing the same words, which earlier that evening Oliver and I had heard Dante the statue recite. Everyone was ecstatic, and I was asked to play another, then another. Roman stornelli are usually bawdy, lilting songs, not the lacerating, heart-wrenching arias from Naples. After the third, I looked over at Oliver and said I wanted to go out to take a breath of fresh air.</div>

<div class="line_en">"The most beautiful day of my life and I end up throwing up." He wasn't listening.

My eyes were shut, but I knew he had stopped kissing me to look around him; people could be walking by. I didn't want to look. Let him be the one to worry. Then we kissed again. And, with my eyes still shut, I think I did hear two voices, old men's voices, grumbling something about taking a good look at these two, wondering if in the old days you'd ever see such a sight. But I didn't want to think about them. I didn't worry. If he wasn't worried, I wasn't worried.

When, by mistake, we reached the normally crowded Piazza Rotonda around the Pantheon, it too was unusually empty. There were a few tourists lugging huge knapsacks, a few drunks, and the usual drug dealers. Oliver stopped a street vendor and bought me a Lemonsoda. The taste of bitter lemons was refreshing and made me feel better. Oliver bought a bitter orange drink and a slice of watermelon. He offered me a bite, but I said no. How wonderful, to walk half drunk with a Lemonsoda on a muggy night like this around the gleaming slate cobblestones of Rome with someone's arm around me. We turned left and, heading toward Piazza Febo, suddenly, from nowhere, made out someone strumming a guitar, singing not a rock song, but as we got closer, an old, old Neapolitan tune. "Fenesta ca lucive." It took me a moment to recognize it. Then I remembered.</div>
