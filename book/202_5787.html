<div class="line_en">When Harry woke the following day it was several seconds before he remembered what had happened. Then he hoped, childishly, that it had been a dream, that Ron was still there and had never left. Yet by turning his head on his pillow he could see Ron's deserted bunk. It was like a dead body in the way it seemed to draw his eyes. Harry jumped down from his own bed, keeping his eyes averted from Ron's. Hermione, who was already busy in the kitchen, did not wish Harry good morning, but turned her face away quickly as he went by.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天哈利醒来时，过了几秒钟才想起发生了什么事。他天真地希望那是个梦，希望罗恩还在这儿，没有离开。可是他转过头，看到的是罗恩的空床，像横在路上的尸体那样吸引着他的目光。哈利从自己的床上跳下来，不去看罗恩的床铺。赫敏已经在厨房里忙碌，哈利走过时，她没有跟他说早上好，而是急忙扭过头去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He and Hermione ate breakfast in silence. Hermione's eyes were puffy and red; she looked as if she had not slept. They packed up their things, Hermione dawdling. Harry knew why she wanted to spin out their time on the riverbank; several times he saw her look up eagerly, and he was sure she had deluded herself into thinking that she heard footsteps through the heavy rain, but no red-haired figure appeared between the trees. Every time Harry imitated her, looked around (for he could not help hoping a little, himself) and saw nothing but rain-swept woods, another little parcel of fury exploded inside him. He could hear Ron saying, "We thought you knew what you were doing!", and he resumed packing with a hard knot in the pit of his stomach.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他和赫敏在沉默中吃完了早饭。赫敏两眼红肿，看来一夜未睡。两人收拾行装时，赫敏磨磨蹭蹭。哈利知道她为什么希望在河边拖延时间。有几次发现她热切地抬起头，他相信她是自己欺骗自己，以为在大雨中听到了脚步声。然而，没有红头发的身影出现在树林中。每次哈利像她那样四下张望（他自己也忍不住抱着一点希望），却只看到被雨水冲刷的树林时，心中便有一小股怒火在喷发。他能听到罗恩说：“我们以为你知道自己在干什么！”于是他继续收拾行装，心窝里像堵着一个硬疙瘩。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He's gone, Harry told himself. He's gone. He had to keep thinking it as he washed and dressed, as though repetition would dull the shock of it. He's gone and he's not coming back. And that was the simple truth of it, Harry knew, because their protective enchantments meant that it would be impossible, once they vacated this spot, for Ron to find them again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他走了，哈利对自己说。他走了。洗脸穿衣时，他止不住一直这么想，好像重复它会使打击减轻一些似的。他走了，不回来了。这是简单的事实，哈利知道，因为他们的防护魔法意味着，只要他们一离开这个地方，罗恩就无法找到他们了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The muddy river beside them was rising rapidly and would soon spill over onto their bank. They had lingered a good hour after they would usually have departed their campsite. Finally having entirely repacked the beaded bag three times, Hermione seemed unable to find any more reasons to delay: She and Harry grasped hands and Disapparated, reappearing on a windswept heather-covered hillside.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="混浊的河水迅速上涨，很快就会漫上他们这片堤岸。两人比正常应该离开营地的时间多逗留了一个小时。终于，把串珠小包打开又重装三次之后，赫敏似乎再也找不出拖延的理由了，她和哈利手拉手幻影移形，出现在一片石南丛生、狂风呼啸的山坡上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The instant they arrived, Hermione dropped Harry's hand and walked away from him, finally sitting down on a large rock, her face on her knees, shaking with what he knew were sobs. He watched her, supposing that he ought to go and comfort her, but something kept him rooted to the spot. Everything inside him felt cold and tight: Again he saw the contemptuous expression on Ron's face. Harry strode off through the heather, walking in a large circle with the distraught Hermione at its center, casting the spells she usually performed to ensure their protection.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一到地方，赫敏就松开哈利的手，从他身边走开，最后坐到一块大石头上，脸埋在膝头，身体发抖。哈利知道她在哭。他望着她，觉得应该去安慰她，但不知什么东西使他定在了原地。他从内到外都冷冰冰、紧绷绷的：又看到罗恩脸上轻蔑的表情。哈利在石南丛中大步走动，以情绪紊乱的赫敏为圆心绕着大圈，施着她往常为保护他们安全而施的魔咒。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They did not discuss Ron at all over the next few days. Harry was determined never to mention his name again, and Hermione seemed to know that it was no use forcing the issue, although sometimes at night when she thought he was sleeping, he would hear her crying. Meanwhile Harry had started bringing out the Marauder's Map and examining it by wandlight. He was waiting for the moment when Ron's labeled dot would reappear in the corridors of Hogwarts, proving that he had returned to the comfortable castle, protected by his status of pureblood. However, Ron did not appear on the map, and after a while Harry found himself taking it out simply to stare at Ginny's name in the girls' dormitory, wondering whether the intensity with which he gazed at it might break into her sleep, that she would somehow know he was thinking about her, hoping that she was all right.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们接下来几天都没有谈到罗恩。哈利决心不再提起他的名字，赫敏似乎知道硬要提起也没有用。但有时在夜里，当她以为他睡着了的时候，哈利能听到她在偷偷地哭泣。而哈利则开始拿出活点地图，用魔杖照着细看。他在等待标着罗恩的黑点出现在霍格沃茨走廊上，证明他回到了舒适的城堡里，受到他纯血统身份的保护。然而，罗恩没有在地图上出现。过了一段时间，哈利发现自己拿出地图只是为了盯着女生宿舍里金妮的名字，不知道自己热切的目光能不能进入她的梦境，让她感应到他在想念她，愿她一切都好。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">By day, they devoted themselves to trying to determine the possible locations of Gryffindor's sword, but the more they talked about the places in which Dumbledore might have hidden it, the more desperate and far-fetched their speculation became. Cudgel his brains though he might, Harry could not remember Dumbledore ever mentioning a place in which he might hide something. There were moments when he did not know whether he was angrier with Ron or with Dumbledore. We thought you knew what you were doing… We thought Dumbledore had told you what to do… We thought you had a real plan!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="白天，他们冥思苦想格兰芬多的宝剑可能在哪里，讨论邓布利多会选择什么地方来藏它。可是越讨论，他们的猜测就越绝望牵强。哈利无论怎么敲脑袋，也想不起邓布利多提过藏东西的地方。有时候他不知道是罗恩还是邓布利多更让他生气。我们以为你知道自己在干什么……我们以为邓布利多告诉过你要干什么……我们以为你有一个真正的计划！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He could not hide it from himself: Ron had been right. Dumbledore had left him with virtually nothing. They had discovered one Horcrux, but they had no means of destroying it: The others were as unattainable as they had ever been. Hopelessness threatened to engulf him. He was staggered now to think of his own presumption in accepting his friends' offers to accompany him on this meandering, pointless journey. He knew nothing, he had no ideas, and he was constantly, painfully on the alert for any indication that Hermione too was about to tell him that she had had enough, that she was leaving.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他无法对自己隐瞒：罗恩是对的，邓布利多留给他的几乎是零。他们发现了一个魂器，但没有办法摧毁它，另外几个和以前一样无从寻觅。绝望似乎要将他吞没。哈利现在想想都吃惊，他竟然那么自以为是，让两个朋友来陪自己开始这场漫无目标的旅行。他什么都不知道，也没有主意，他一直痛苦地提防着任何一丝迹象，怕赫敏也会来跟他说她受够了，要走了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">However, he did let drop certain snippets. Snape seemed to be facing a constant, low level of mutiny from a hard core of students. Ginny had been banned from going into Hogsmeade. Snape had reinstated Umbridge's old decree forbidding gatherings of three or more students or any unofficial student societies.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，他还是透露了一些片断。斯内普要对付一帮死硬派学生持续不断的低调反抗。金妮被禁止进入霍格莫德。斯内普恢复了乌姆里奇的旧规定，禁止三人以上的学生集会以及任何非正式的学生社团。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They were spending many evenings in near silence, and Hermione took to bringing out Phineas Nigellus's portrait and propping it up in a chair, as though he might fill part of the gaping hole left by Ron's departure. Despite his previous assertion that he would never visit them again, Phineas Nigellus did not seem able to resist the chance to find out more about what Harry was up to, and consented to reappear, blindfolded, every few days or so. Harry was even glad to see him, because he was company, albeit of a snide and taunting kind. They relished any news about what was happening at Hogwarts, though Phineas Nigellus was not an ideal informer. He venerated Snape, the first Slytherin headmaster since he himself had controlled the school, and they had to be careful not to CRIticize or ask impertinent questions about Snape, or Phineas Nigellus would instantly leave his painting.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="许多个夜晚，他们几乎都是在沉默中度过的，赫敏常把菲尼亚斯·奈杰勒斯的画像拿出来，支在椅子上，仿佛他能填补罗恩出走留下的巨大空洞似的。菲尼亚斯·奈杰勒斯尽管上次扬言决不再来，却似乎无法抗拒这打探哈利情况的机会，所以同意每隔几天蒙着眼睛出现一次。哈利甚至挺高兴见到他，毕竟是个伴，虽然是讥诮讽刺的那种。他们喜欢听任何发生在霍格沃茨的新闻，但菲尼亚斯·奈杰勒斯不是个好的报告员。他崇敬斯内普——那是自从他本人掌管学校之后第一位斯莱特林出身的校长。哈利他们要小心，不能批评斯内普或提出对他不敬的问题，否则菲尼亚斯·奈杰勒斯就会马上离开画面。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">From all of these things, Harry deduced that Ginny, and probably Neville and Luna along with her, had been doing their best to continue Dumbledore's Army. This scant news made Harry want to see Ginny so badly it felt like a stomachache; but it also made him think of Ron again, and of Dumbledore, and of Hogwarts itself, which he missed nearly as much as his ex-girlfriend. Indeed, as Phineas Nigellus talked about Snape's crackdown, Harry experienced a split second of madness when he imagined simply going back to school to join the destabilization of Snape's regime: Being fed, and having a soft bed, and other people being in charge, seemed the most wonderful prospect in the world at that moment. But then he remembered that he was Undesirable Number One, that there was a ten-thousand-Galleon price on his head, and that to walk into Hogwarts these days was just as dangerous as walking into the Ministry of Magic. Indeed, Phineas Nigellus inadvertently emphasized this fact by slipping in leading questions about Harry and Hermione's whereabouts. Hermione shoved him back inside the beaded bag every time he did this, and Phineas Nigellus invariably refused to reappear for several days after these unceremonious good-byes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从这一切中，哈利推测金妮，可能还有纳威和卢娜跟她一起，在尽力维持邓布利多军。零星的消息使哈利如此渴望见到金妮，几乎想到了胃痛的程度，同时也让他想到了罗恩，想到了邓布利多，想到了霍格沃茨，他对学校的思念几乎和对女友的一样强烈。真的，当菲尼亚斯·奈杰勒斯讲述斯内普的镇压措施时，哈利有过一刹那的疯狂，他想象着干脆回学校去参加给斯内普捣乱的行动：有饱饭吃，有软和的床铺睡，有别人的负责，似乎是世界上最美妙的生活。但他随即想起自己是头号不良分子，被悬赏一万金加隆通缉，如今走进霍格沃茨就像走进魔法部一样危险。菲尼亚斯·奈杰勒斯无意间强调了这一事实，他常用诱导性的问题探听哈利和赫敏在什么地方。每当这种时候，赫敏便把他塞回串珠小包。在这样粗暴的送行之后，菲尼亚斯·奈杰勒斯总是几天都不肯露面。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They had already spotted Christmas trees twinkling from several sitting room windows before there came an evening when Harry resolved to suggest, again, what seemed to him the only unexplored avenue left to them. They had just eaten an unusually good meal: Hermione had been to a supermarket under the Invisibility Cloak (scrupulously dropping the money into an open till as she left), and Harry thought that she might be more persuadable than usual on a stomach full of spaghetti Bolognese and tinned pears. He had also had the foresight to suggest that they take a few hours' break from wearing the Horcrux, which was hanging over the end of the bunk beside him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们已经从几家客厅窗口看到圣诞树在闪耀，一天晚上，哈利终于决心再次提起在他看来是剩下的惟一一条路。刚吃完一顿难得的美餐（赫敏穿着隐形衣去了超市，还细心地往收银台抽屉里丢了些钱），肚子里填满了意大利细面条和梨罐头，哈利想她这时也许会比平时更容易说动一些。而且他已周密地预先提议歇几个小时不戴魂器，它现在正挂在他身边的床头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The weather grew colder and colder. They did not dare remain in any one area too long, so rather than staying in the south of England, where a hard ground frost was the worst of their worries, they continued to meander up and down the country, braving a mountainside, where sleet pounded the tent; a wide, flat marsh, where the tent was flooded with chill water; and a tiny island in the middle of a Scottish loch, where snow half buried the tent in the night.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="天气越来越冷。因为不敢在一个地区待得太久，他们没有留在英国南部（那儿最坏也就是地面结霜而已），而是继续在国内四处迁徙。半山腰，冻雨敲打着帐篷；沼泽地，冷水灌进帐篷里；苏格兰的湖心小岛，夜间积雪埋住了半个帐篷。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Upon the signature of the International Statute of Secrecy in 1689, wizards went into hiding for good. It was natural, perhaps, that they formed their own small communities within a community. Many small villages and hamlets attracted several magical families, who banded together for mutual support and protection. The villages of Tinworth in Cornwall, Upper Flagley in Yorkshire, and Ottery St. Catchpole on the south coast of England were notable homes to knots of Wizarding families who lived alongside tolerant and sometimes Confunded Muggles. Most celebrated of these half-magical dwelling places is, perhaps, Godric's Hollow, the West Country village where the great wizard Godric Gryffindor was born, and where Bowman Wright, Wizarding smith, forged the first Golden Snitch. The graveyard is full of the names of ancient magical families, and this accounts, no doubt, for the stories of hauntings that have dogged the little church beside it for many centuries."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="《国际保密法》一六八九年签署生效之后，巫师们彻底转入隐蔽。也许是自然而然地，他们在社区内部形成了自己的小社区。许多小村庄都吸引了几户巫师家庭，这几家便团结起来，互相帮助，互相保护。康沃尔郡的丁沃斯、约克郡的上弗莱格利、英格兰南海岸的奥特里－圣卡奇波尔，都有巫师家庭聚居，在宽容的、有时是被施了混淆咒的麻瓜中间生活。在此类半巫师聚居地中，最著名的也许是戈德里克山谷。这个西南部的村庄是伟大的巫师戈德里克·格兰芬多的出生地，也是巫师金匠鲍曼·赖特打造第一个金飞贼的地方。墓地上刻满古老巫师家族的姓氏，这无疑也是小教堂许多世纪以来鬼故事不断的原因。">查看中文翻译</div>

It was in Godric's Hollow that, but for Voldemort, he would have grown up and spent every school holiday.

The life he had lost had hardly ever seemed so real to him as at this moment, when he knew he was about to see the place where it had been taken from him. After Hermione had gone to bed that night, Harry quietly extracted his rucksack from Hermione's beaded bag, and from inside it, the photograph album Hagrid had given him so long ago.

<div class="line_en">Hermione was two rows of tombstones away; he had to wade back to her, his heart positively banging in his chest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="赫敏在两排墓碑以外，他只好费力地返回去，心脏怦怦地撞击着胸口。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She pointed to the dark stone. Harry stooped down and saw, upon the frozen, lichen-spotted granite, the words Kendra Dumbledore and, a short way below her dates of birth and death, and Her Daughter Ariana. There was also a quotation:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她指着黑乎乎的碑石，哈利弯下腰，看到在结冰的、青苔斑驳的花岗石上，刻着坎德拉·邓布利多，生卒日期底下是及女儿阿利安娜。还有一句格言：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So Rita Skeeter and Muriel had got some of their facts right. The Dumbledore family had indeed lived here, and part of it had died here.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那么，丽塔·斯基特和穆丽尔说对了几分事实。邓布利多一家确实在这儿住过，还有人在这儿去世。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Seeing the grave was worse than hearing about it. Harry could not help thinking that he and Dumbledore both had deep roots in this graveyard, and that Dumbledore ought to have told him so, yet he had never thought to share the connection. They could have visited the place together; for a moment Harry imagined coming here with Dumbledore, of what a bond that would have been, of how much it would have meant to him. But it seemed that to Dumbledore, the fact that their families lay side by side in the same graveyard had been an unimportant coincidence, irrelevant, perhaps, to the job he wanted Harry to do.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="看到这坟墓比听说时还要难过，哈利不禁心潮起伏，他和邓布利多都有深深的根埋在这片墓地中。邓布利多本该告诉他这一点，但他从来没想点破这层关系。他们本可以一起访问这个地方，一瞬间哈利想象着跟邓布利多同来这里，那将是怎样的一种交情，那将对他有多么大的意义。然而对于邓布利多而言，他们的亲人躺在同一块墓地上，似乎只是个不重要的巧合，或许与他要哈利做的事情毫不相干。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Hermione was looking at Harry, and he was glad that his face was hidden in shadow. He read the words on the tombstone again. Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. He did not understand what these words meant. Surely Dumbledore had chosen them, as the eldest member of the family once his mother had died.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="赫敏在望着他，哈利庆幸自己的脸在暗处。他又读了读墓碑上的字。珍宝在何处，心也在何处。但他不明白这话的意思。这一定是邓布利多选的碑文，母亲去世后他就成了一家之主。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Are you sure he never mentioned --?" Hermione began.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你确定他从没提过——？”赫敏问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No," said Harry curtly, then, "let's keep looking," and he turned away, wishing he had not seen the stone: He did not want his excited trepidation tainted with resentment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没有，”哈利简短地说，“接着找吧。”他转身走开，希望自己没有看到那块石碑。他不想让自己激动的颤栗被怨恨沾染。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He did not want to be sidetracked again, and only grudgingly made his way back through the snow toward her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他不想再被打岔，老大不情愿地踏着雪向她走去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She was rubbing at a crumbling, mossy stone, gazing down at it, a little frown on her face.</div>

<div class="line_en">He peered at the place she indicated: The stone was so worn that it was hard to make out what was engraved there, though there did seem to be a triangular mark beneath the nearly illegible name.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I'm going to keep looking for my parents, all right?" Harry told her, a slight edge to his voice, and he set off again, leaving her crouched beside the old grave.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我接着去找我父母，好吗？”哈利对她说，声音有一点尖锐，然后便走开了，留下她蹲在古老的墓碑旁。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Every now and then he recognized a surname that, like Abbott, he had met at Hogwarts. Sometimes there were several generations of the same Wizarding family represented in the graveyard: Harry could tell from the dates that it had either died out, or the current members had moved away from Godric's Hollow. Deeper and deeper amongst the graves he went, and every time he reached a new headstone he felt a little lurch of apprehension and anticipation.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他时不时地认出一个像艾博那样，在霍格沃茨见到过的姓氏。有时同一巫师家族的几代人都列在这块墓碑上。哈利从年代上看出，这些家庭有的死绝了，有的后代离开了戈德里克山谷。他在墓地中越走越远，每次走近一块墓碑，他便感到一阵既害怕又期待的激动。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The darkness and the silence seemed to become, all of a sudden, much deeper. Harry looked around, worried, thinking of dementors, then realized that the carols had finished, that the chatter and flurry of churchgoers were fading away as they made their way back into the square. Somebody inside the church had just turned off the lights.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="黑暗和寂静似乎突然加深了许多。哈利担心地环顾四周，想到了摄魂怪，然后意识到颂歌结束了，杂乱的人声在渐渐远去，做礼拜的人们散入广场中。教堂里有人刚把灯熄灭。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Hermione had taken his hand again and was gripping it tightly. He could not look at her, but returned the pressure, now taking deep, sharp gulps of the night air, trying to steady himself, trying to regain control. He should have brought something to give them, and he had not thought of it, and every plant in the graveyard was leafless and frozen. But Hermione raised her wand, moved it in a circle through the air, and a wreath of Christmas roses blossomed before them. Harry caught it and laid it on his parents' grave.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="赫敏又拉住了他的手，紧紧地握着。他不能看她，但用力回握着，深深地大口吸进夜晚的凉气，努力使自己平静下来。他应该带点什么给他们的，来时没有想到，墓地上的植物都光秃秃的，结了冰。赫敏举起魔杖，在空中画了一个圈，一个圣诞玫瑰花环盛开在他们面前。哈利接住它，摆在父母的坟上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It doesn't mean defeating death in the way the Death Eaters mean it, Harry," said Hermione, her voice gentle. "It means… you know… living beyond death. Living after death."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“它指的不是食死徒那种打败死亡的方式，哈利，”赫敏声音温柔地说，“它指的是……你知道……生命超越死亡，虽死犹生。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But they were not living, thought Harry: They were gone. The empty words could not disguise the fact that his parents' moldering remains lay beneath snow and stone, indifferent, unknowing. And tears came before he could stop them, boiling hot then instantly freezing on his face, and what was the point in wiping them off or pretending? He let them fall, his lips pressed hard together, looking down at the thick snow hiding from his eyes the place where the last of Lily and James lay, bones now, surely, or dust, not knowing or caring that their living son stood so near, his heart still beating, alive because of their sacrifice and close to wishing, at this moment, that he was sleeping under the snow with them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可他们没有生命，哈利想：他们不在了。空洞的文字掩饰不了这个现实，他父母腐烂的尸骸躺在冰雪和石头下面，冷冰冰的，没有知觉。泪水一下子涌了出来，滚烫滚烫，顷刻间冻在脸上，擦拭和掩饰又有什么意义？他任凭泪水纵横，紧闭双唇，低头看着厚厚的积雪，那下面掩盖着莉莉和詹姆的遗体，现在想必只剩下骨头与泥土，不知道、也不关心他们留在世上的儿子站在这么近的地方。他的心脏仍在有力地跳动，是他们的牺牲换来的，但他此刻几乎希望自己和他们一起长眠在白雪下面。">查看中文翻译</div>
