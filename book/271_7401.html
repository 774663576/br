<div class="line_en">Carlisle and Edward had not been able to catch up with Irina before her trail disappeared into the sound. They'd swum to the other bank to see if her trail had picked up in a straight line, but there was no trace of her for miles in either direction on the eastern shore.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was all my fault. She had come, as Alice had seen, to make peace with the Cullens, only to be angered by my camaraderie with Jacob. I wished I'd noticed her earlier, before Jacob had phased. I wished we'd gone hunting somewhere else.</div>

<div class="line_en">There wasn't much to be done. Carlisle had called Tanya with the disappointing news. Tanya and Kate hadn't seen Irina since they'd decided to come to my wedding, and they were distraught that Irina had come so close and yet not returned home; it wasn't easy for them to lose their sister, however temporary the separation might be. I wondered if this brought back hard memories of losing their mother so many centuries ago.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在也没什么好办法。卡莱尔刚把这个失望的消失告诉坦尼娅，自从她和凯特决定在参加我的婚礼后，就再没见过伊琳娜了。但是这次伊琳娜离家这么近都不回去看看她们，实在是让人伤心。对她们来说，不管是不是暂时的，失去自己的姐妹都是非常难受的。我猜这可能会让她们想起失去几个世纪前失去自己的母亲的痛苦回忆。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Alice was able to catch a few glimpses of Irina's immediate future, nothing too concrete. She wasn't going back to Denali, as far as Alice could tell. The picture was hazy. All Alice could see was that Irina was visibly upset; she wandered in the snow -- swathed wilderness -- to the north? To the east? -- with a devastated expression. She made no decisions for a new course beyond her directionless grieving.</div>

<div class="line_en">Every detail had been gone over a hundred times already. We would start with the Ticunas, tracing their legends as well as we could at the source. Now that it was accepted that Jacob would come with us, he figured prominently in the plans -- it was unlikely that the people who believed in vampires would speak to any of us about their stories. If we dead-ended with the Ticunas, there were many closely related tribes in the area to research. Carlisle had some old friends in the Amazon; if we could find them, they might have information for us, too. Or at least a suggestion as to where else we might go for answers. It was unlikely that the three Amazon vampires had anything to do with the legends of vampire hybrids themselves, as they were all female. There was no way to know how long our search would take.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="每个细节都被考虑了无数遍，我们将从蒂库纳人开始，跟着他们古老传说的脚印前进。现在雅各布同行的事也被大家接受了，而且还起着至关重要的作用——想要让那些根本不相信吸血鬼存在的人告诉我们他们的故事，可不是件容易的事。就算在蒂库纳人身上我们一无所获，他们附近也还是有许多类似的种族。而且卡莱尔在亚马逊那边也有很多老朋友，如果我们还能找到他们，相信也能从他们那儿获得很多信息，至少到时也能决定下个目的地是哪里。不过很可能我们在那三个亚马逊吸血鬼身上不能找到任何关于吸血鬼混血儿的消息，因为她们三儿都是女的。我们完全不知道这趟旅程何时才会结束。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Days passed and, though of course I forgot nothing, Irina and her pain moved to the back of my mind. There were more important things to think of now. I would leave for Italy in just a few days. When I got back, we'd all be off to South America.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="日子一天天过去，但我什么都没有忘记，伊琳娜和她的痛苦时时刻刻在我脑海盘旋。但现在我有更重要的事要考虑，几天之内我就要出发去意大利了。等我回来后，我们马上就会去南美洲。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Meanwhile, Emmett and Jasper were more excited about planning the hunting possibilities. The Amazon offered a change from our normal quarry. Jaguars and panthers, for example. Emmett had a whim to wrestle with an anaconda. Esme and Rosalie were planning what they would pack. Jacob was off with Sam's pack, setting things up for his own absence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此时，埃美特和贾斯帕倒是对新的狩猎可能兴奋无比。相比于平时的猎物，亚马逊森林给我们提供了更多的选择。例如，美洲虎和黑豹。埃美特有个怪异的念头——想跟亚马逊巨蟒摔跤。埃斯梅和罗莎莉讨论着行李的问题。雅各布今天回山姆那里去了，要交代下他离开的这段时间的一些问题。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Alice moved slowly -- for her -- around the big room, unnecessarily tidying the already immaculate space, straightening Esme's perfectly hung garlands. She was re-centering Esme's vases on the console at the moment. I could see from the way her face fluctuated -- aware, then blank, then aware again -- that she was searching the future. I assumed she was trying to see through the blind spots that Jacob and Renesmee made in her visions as to what was waiting for us in South America until Jasper said, "Let it go, Alice; she's not our concern," and a cloud of serenity stole silently and invisibly through the room.</div>

<div class="line_en">My first illogical thought was that Alice was playing some joke on us. Because there was no way that Alice could have dropped the vase by accident. I could have darted across the room to catch the vase in plenty of time myself, if I hadn't assumed she would get it. And how would it fall through her fingers in the first place? Her perfectly sure fingers…</div>

<div class="line_en">She stuck her tongue out at Jasper and then lifted one crystal vase that was filled with white and red roses and turned toward the kitchen.

<div class="line_en">Irina, wringing her hands in the snowy wilderness -- not mourning Laurent, after all, but knowing it was her duty to turn the Cullens in, knowing what would happen to them if she did. Apparently her conscience had won out over the centuries of friendship.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但不管怎样，伊琳娜现在还是在大雪覆盖的野外徘徊犹豫着——而不是在劳伦特前面哭诉。可是衡量揭发卡伦家的责任和可能的后果两者，很明显，她的良心还是战胜了我们几个世纪的友谊。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">With Irina's past, how could she apply any other reading to what she'd seen that day in the narrow field? She had not been close enough to hear Renesmee's heart, to feel the heat radiating from her body. Renesmee's rosy cheeks could have been a trick on our part for all she knew.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果伊琳娜就这样去了，那天她在那样狭小的区域所看见的所有事情肯定会被他们读出来。而且她那天太远了根本没听见蕾妮斯梅的心跳声，也不可能感觉得到她身体的温暖。她肯定以为蕾妮斯梅白里透红的脸蛋只是我们做的伪装。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And the Volturi's response to this kind of infraction was so automatic, it was already decided.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="而且沃尔图里家族对这种“违规”的责任感又如此理所当然。此时，判决已经生成了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I turned and draped myself over Renesmee's sleeping body, covering her with my hair, burying my face in her curls.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我低头靠紧蕾妮斯梅熟睡的小身躯，把头埋进她的卷发，将她藏在我的发丝里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After all, the Cullens were in league with werewolves. From Irina's point of view, maybe this meant nothing was beyond us…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="毕竟，卡伦家族现在跟狼人结盟了。可能从伊琳娜的角度来看，这意味着没有什么东西比我们更可恨了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Think of what she saw that afternoon," I said in a low voice, interrupting whatever Emmett was beginning to say. "To someone who'd lost a mother because of the immortal children, what would Renesmee look like?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“想一想她下午看到的东西，”我低哑的说，打断埃美特正开始说的话。“想一想，对于一个正是因为吸血鬼小孩而失去母亲的的人来说，蕾妮斯梅是个什么样的东西。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I babbled on, waiting for someone to exhale with relief, waiting for the icy tension in the room to relax as they realized I was right. The room just seemed to get colder. Eventually my small voice trailed off into silence. No one spoke for a long time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我无法抑制地不停地说着，等待着某人来让我解脱，等待着他们相信我是正确的，然后让房间里这绷紧的冰冷的气氛消失。但气氛只是越来越冷，直到我的声音越来越小最后也归于寂静。没有人说话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then Edward whispered into my hair. "It's not the kind of crime they hold a trial for, love," he said quietly. "Aro's seen Irina's proof in her thoughts. They come to destroy, not to be reasoned with."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="过了很久，爱德华在我的头发里轻语。“但这并不是他们所知道的，亲爱的，”他轻轻的说道。“阿罗所知道的一切就是伊琳娜脑中的所见。他们是为了毁灭而来，而不是为了你的理由。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But she's wrong," I went on. "Renesmee isn't like those other children. They were frozen, but she grows so much every day. They were out of control, but she never hurts Charlie or Sue or even shows them things that would upset them. She can control herself. She's already smarter than most adults. There would be no reason…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“但是她错了。”我接着说。“蕾妮斯梅和其他吸血鬼小孩不一样。其他的小孩，他们是冰冷的，停滞的，但她每天都在成长。他们无法控制，但她从来没有伤害过查理或苏，甚至没有在他们面前展示那些可能刺激他们的东西。她可以控制自己。她甚至比成人还要聪明。他们没有理由…。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">His voice was still quiet, gentle, velvet… and yet the pain and desolation in the sound was unavoidable. His voice was like Alice's eyes before -- like the inside of a tomb.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“现在我们能做什么？”我问道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Was this the limit, then? I'd had more happiness than most people ever experienced. Was there some natural law that demanded equal shares of happiness and misery in the world? Was my joy overthrowing the balance? Was four months all I could have?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这又是另一个期限吗？相比于大多数人，我已经经历了太多的幸福，所以难道这一切的发生，就是应验了那条令世界上的幸福与痛苦保持平衡的自然法则？是我拥有的幸福太多了吗？我有资格拥有的只是仅仅这四个月吗？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, we can't run. Not with Demetri around." Emmett made a disgusted noise, and I knew instinctively that he was not upset by the idea of the Volturi's tracker but by the idea of running away. "And I don't know that we can't win," he said. "There are a few options to consider. We don't have to fight alone."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好吧，但我们也不可能逃跑。没有Demetri。”埃美特鄙弃地哼了一声，我本能的觉得他并不是因为沃尔图里的跟踪装置而恶心，而是因为那个逃跑的主意。“而且我根本就不知道为什么我们赢不了，”他说。“仍然有很多方法可以考虑。我们没有必要独自战斗。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Renesmee was so warm and perfect in my arms, dreaming peacefully. I'd worried so much about Renesmee's speeding age -- worried that she would only have little over a decade of life… That terror seemed ironic now.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="蕾妮斯梅在我的臂弯里，如此温暖、完美，平静地做着梦。我曾经如此的担心蕾妮斯梅那飞速的成长，担心她可能只能拥有短暂的十多年的生命…而那些担心，现在看起来是多么讽刺。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="卡莱尔也对我低声安慰道，“还有其他的朋友，他们不会有生命危险的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Chill, Bella." His expression was no different from when he was contemplating fighting anacondas. Even the threat of annihilation couldn't change Emmett's perspective, his ability to thrill to a challenge. "I didn't mean the pack. Be realistic, though -- do you think Jacob or Sam is going to ignore an invasion? Even if it wasn't about Nessie? Not to mention that, thanks to Irina, Aro knows about our alliance with the pack now, too. But I was thinking of our other friends."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“别这样，贝拉。”他的语气就像看到自己在和亚马逊的巨蟒搏斗一样兴趣浓厚。即使是毁灭性的威胁也无法改变埃美特对此的热情，他狂爱挑战。“我并不是指他们。虽然这样，就现实来说，即使这不关内希的事，你认为雅各布或者山姆会对这样公然大规模的入侵没有一点反应？先不提这个，还多亏了伊琳娜，阿罗知道了我们狼人同盟的存在，但我想还应该考虑下我们其他的朋友。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Hey, we'll let them decide," Emmett said in a placating tone. "I'm not saying they have to fight with us." I could see the plan refining itself in his head as he spoke. "If they'd just stand beside us, just long enough to make the Volturi hesitate. Bella's right, after all. If we could force them to stop and listen. Though that might take away any reason for a fight…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嘿，我们可以让他们自己来决定，”埃美特用息事的声调说。“我并没有说他们一定得和我们一块战斗。”我感觉到就在说的过程中，一个计划正在埃美特的脑海中逐渐成形。“他们可以只用站在我们旁边，这样也许足够使沃尔图里犹豫。毕竟贝拉是对的，如果我们能够让他们停下来肯听我们说话，这样我们就有时间给出某个理由来避免这场战斗…”">查看中文翻译</div>
