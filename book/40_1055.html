<div class="line_en">Mariam saw Rasheed enter the yard first. He let the gate go prematurely, and it almost hit the girl on the face. He crossed the yard in a few, quick steps. Mariam detected a shadow on his face, a darkness underlying the coppery light of dusk. In the house, he took off his coat, threw it on the couch. Brushing past Mariam, he said in a brusque voice, "I'm hungry. Get supper ready."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛丽雅姆看见拉希德先走进院子。他没把门完全推开就走进来了，门差点摔到女孩的脸。他三步并做两步，跨过院子。玛丽雅姆察觉到他脸上有一抹阴影，在黄昏的棕黄色光芒中黑着脸。进了房间，他脱掉外套，把它扔在沙发上。他匆匆从玛丽雅姆身旁走过，粗暴地说：“我饿了。去准备晚饭。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Early one morning the next spring, of 1993, Mariam stood by the living-room window and watched Rasheed escort the girl out of the house. The girl was tottering forward, bent at the waist, one arm draped protectively across the taut drum of her belly, the shape of which was visible through her burqa. Rasheed, anxious and overly attentive, was holding her elbow, directing her across the yard like a traffic policeman. He made a Wait here gesture, rushed to the front gate, then motioned for the girl to come forward, one foot propping the gate open. When she reached him, he took her by the hand, helped her through the gate. Mariam could almost hear him say, "Watch your step, now, my flower, my gul."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="1993年初春的一天清早，玛丽雅姆站在客厅的窗户旁边，看着拉希德陪着女孩走出房子。女孩弯着腰，跌跌撞撞地向前走，一只手护着绷得紧紧的鼓起腹部。她的肚子大得隔着布卡也清晰可见。拉希德十分紧张，露出极度关心的神色，抓住她的手肘，像一个交通警察那样扶着她穿过院子。他做了一个在这儿等等的手势，冲到前门，一只脚把门踢开，然后挥手让女孩向前走。她走到他身边，他拉着她的手，扶她穿过大门。玛丽雅姆几乎能听到他的说话声：“当心脚下，喏，我的花儿。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The front door to the house opened. From the hallway, Mariam saw the girl, a swaddled bundle in the hook of her left arm. She had one foot outside, the other inside, against the door, to prevent it from springing shut. She was stooped over and was grunting, trying to reach for the paper bag of belongings that she had put down in order to open the door. Her face was grimacing with effort. She looked up and saw Mariam.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“就好像有人拿着螺丝刀在我耳朵里面转来转去。”拉希德揉着眼睛说。他站在玛丽雅姆房间的门口，双眼浮肿，只穿着长袍，松松垮垮地系着一条腰带。他满头白发蓬松而凌乱。“这哭声。我忍受不了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

She tiptoed to their door, listened to him complain about the baby -- always the baby -- the insistent crying, the smells, the toys that made him trip, the way the baby had hijacked Laila's attentions from him with constant demands to be fed, burped, changed, walked, held. The girl, in turn, scolded him for smoking in the room, for not letting the baby sleep with them.</div>

She marveled at how the girl's eyes shone with worship, even in the mornings when her face drooped and her complexion was waxy from a night's worth of walking the baby. The girl had fits of laughter when the baby passed gas. The tiniest changes in the baby enchanted her, and everything it did was declared spectacular.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then an astonishing thing happened: The girl lunged at him. She grabbed his arm with both hands and tried to drag him down, but she could do no more than dangle from it. She did succeed in slowing Rasheed's progress toward Mariam.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着，一件让人吃惊的事发生了：女孩向他扑过去。她用两只手抓住他的手臂，使劲地往下拉，但拉希德的力量带得她双脚离地。她成功地拖慢了拉希德走向玛丽雅姆的脚步。">查看中文翻译</div>

He stayed that way a few moments longer, arm raised, chest heaving, a fine sheen of sweat filming his brow. Slowly, Rasheed lowered his arm.

<div class="line_en">THREE TIMES THAT NIGHT, Mariam was awakened from sleep. The first time, it was the rumble of rockets in the west, coming from the direction of Karteh-Char.

<div class="line_en">Mariam had the impression that the baby too was examining her. She was lying on her back, her head tilted sideways, looking at Mariam intently with a mixture of amusement, confusion, and suspicion. Mariam wondered if her face might frighten her, but then the baby squealed happily and Mariam knew that a favorable judgment had been passed on her behalf.</div>

<div class="line_en">The girl was sleeping on her side, snoring. The baby was awake. Mariam lit the kerosene lamp on the table and hunkered down.
