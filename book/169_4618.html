<div class="line_en">The day had been cold and grey and wet. It had poured all morning, and even when the rain stopped that afternoon the clouds refused to part. They never saw the sun. Such wretched weather was enough to discourage even the little queen. Instead of riding with her hens and their retinue of guardsmen and admirers, she spent all day in the Maidenvault with her hens, listening to the Blue Bard sing.</div>

<div class="line_en">"How splendid." She took his hands and kissed him on the cheeks. "I know Tommen will be pleased as well. This will mean that we can release Lord Redwyne's fleet, and drive the ironmen from the Shields." The news from the Reach seemed to grow more dire with every raven. The ironmen had not been content with their new rocks, it seemed. They were raiding up the Mander in strength, and had gone so far as to attack the Arbor and the smaller islands that surrounded it. The Redwynes had kept no more than a dozen warships in their home waters, and all those had been overwhelmed, taken, or sunk. And now there were reports that this madman who called himself Euron Crow's Eye was even sending longships up Whispering Sound toward Oldtown.</div>

<div class="line_en">He was not wrong, the queen knew. Three thousand smallfolk had crowded through the Mud Gate to see Ser Loras off the day he sailed, and three of every four were women. The sight had only served to fill her with contempt. She had wanted to scream at them that they were sheep, to tell them that all that they could ever hope to get from Loras Tyrell was a smile and a flower. Instead she had proclaimed him the boldest knight in the Seven Kingdoms, and smiled as Tommen presented him with a jeweled sword to carry into battle. The king had given him a hug as well, which had not been part of Cersei's plans, but it made no matter now. She could afford to be generous. Loras Tyrell was dying.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一点没错。回想洛拉斯爵士出海那天，三千平民挤到烂泥门观看，其中四分之三是女人。太后心里十分轻蔑，她好想大声尖叫，痛骂这帮绵羊，告诉他们洛拉斯能给的只有微笑与鲜花，然而她不能——她反而宣布洛拉斯爵士是七大王国最勇敢的骑士，并微笑着目睹托曼赐予对方宝石佩剑。国王还顺势拥抱了他，这不在瑟曦计划之内，但现在已无关紧要了。反正太后表现得慷慨大方，而百花骑士已几乎一命呜呼。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The room had grown dark by the time that he was done. The queen lit some candles and sent Dorcas to the kitchens to bring them up some bread and cheese and a bit of boiled beef with horseradish. As they supped, she bid Aurane to tell the tale again, so she would remember all the details correctly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="等维水说完，房间已变得黑暗。太后点起几只蜡烛，并命多卡莎去厨房拿来面包、奶酪和一点山葵调味的煮牛肉。用餐时，她让奥雷恩把故事又说了一遍，好把细节铭记在心，反复回味。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Your Grace is kind," said Waters with a smile. A wicked smile, the queen thought. Aurane did not resemble Prince Rhaegar as much as she had thought. He has the hair, but so do half the whores in Lys, if the tales are true. Rhaegar was a man. This is a sly boy, no more. Useful in his way, though.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“陛下真是太好心了。”维水笑道。一脸坏笑，太后心想。由近观之，奥雷恩实在没有雷加王子的影子。不错，他们头发类似，然而如果传说属实，里斯城里半数的妓女不也一样？雷加是个顶天立地的男子汉，眼前这位不过是会耍小聪明的孩子罢了。好在他有利用价值。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I do not want our precious Margaery to hear these tidings from a stranger, after all," she said. "I will tell her myself."</div>

<div class="line_en">Margaery was in the Maidenvault, sipping wine and trying to puzzle out some new game from Volantis with her three cousins. Though the hour was late, the guards admitted Cersei at once. "Your Grace," she began, "it is best you hear the news from me. Aurane is back from Dragonstone. Your brother is a hero."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛格丽正在处女居内啜饮葡萄美酒，和三位表妹一起玩从瓦兰提斯进口的新游戏。天色虽晚，守卫们还是当即放瑟曦进入。“陛下，”太后道，“我想最好由我亲自来向你通报。奥雷恩从龙石岛回来了，他告诉我，你哥哥成了英雄。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I always knew he was." Margaery did not seem surprised. Why should she? She expected this, from the moment Loras begged for the command. Yet by the time Cersei had finished with her tale, tears glistened on the cheeks of the younger queen. "Redwyne had miners working to drive a tunnel underneath the castle walls, but that was too slow for the Knight of Flowers. No doubt he was thinking of your lord father's people suffering on the Shields. Lord Waters says he ordered the assault not half a day after taking command, after Lord Stannis's castellan refused his offer to settle the siege between them in single combat. Loras was the first one through the breach when the ram broke the castle gates. He rode straight into the dragon's mouth, they say, all in white and swinging his morningstar about his head, slaying left and right."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我知道。”玛格丽淡淡地说，语气不带惊讶。她为什么要惊讶？从洛拉斯恳求统率大军的那晚开始，她就知道会是这个结局。然而，当瑟曦把故事和盘托出，小王后的双颊仍旧闪烁着晶莹的泪珠。“雷德温已命矿工在城堡底下挖掘隧道，但百花骑士嫌进展太慢。毫无疑问，他极为关切盾牌列岛上的子民，渴望把他们从水深火热中拯救出来。据维水大人说，接管指挥权不到半天，当史坦尼斯的代理城主拒绝了一对一决斗的提议后，你哥哥便发动总攻。攻城锤撞破城门，洛拉斯当先杀入，他骑马冲入巨龙口中，一身白衣白甲，流星锤左右挥舞，大家说他勇不可挡。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No one man has that honor," said Cersei. "Ser Loras took a quarrel through the thigh and another through the shoulder, but he fought on gallantly, though the blood was streaming from him. Later he suffered a mace blow that broke some ribs. After that… but no, I would spare you the worst of it."</div>

<div class="line_en">The man proved to be Tyroshi; short and stout and sweaty, with an unctuous smile that reminded her of Varys and a forked beard dyed green and pink. Cersei misliked him on sight, but was willing to overlook his flaws if he actually had Tyrion's head inside the chest he carried. It was cedar, inlaid with ivory in a pattern of vines and flowers, with hinges and clasps of white gold. A lovely thing, but the queen's only interest lay in what might be within. It is big enough, at least. Tyrion had a grotesquely large head, for one so small and stunted.</div>

Crystals adorned the pommels of their longswords and the crests of their greathelms. They carried kite shields of a style not common since the Conquest, displaying a device not seen in the Seven Kingdoms for centuries: a rainbow sword shining bright upon a field of darkness.

The queen did not know why that occurred to her. She had resolved not to give Falyse another thought. Single combat. Falyse should have known better than to marry such a fool. The word from Stokeworth was that Lady Tanda had died of a chill in the chest, brought on by her broken hip. Lollys Lackwit had been proclaimed Lady Stokeworth, with Ser Bronn her lord. Tanda dead and Gyles dying. It is well that we have Moon Boy, or the court would be entirely bereft of fools. The queen smiled as she lay her head upon the pillow.

In Lannisport it was said that she had been young and beautiful when her husband had brought her back from the east with a load of spices, but age and evil had left their marks on her. She was short, squat, and warty, with pebbly greenish jowls. Her teeth were gone and her dugs hung down to her knees.

<div class="line_en">The old man hesitated. One wrinkled hand groped blindly at his chest, as if to stroke the beard that was not there. "Can our morrows be foretold?" he repeated slowly. "Mayhaps. There are certain spells in the old books… but Your Grace might ask instead, 'Should our morrows be foretold?' And to that I should answer, 'No.' Some doors are best left closed."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="老人犹豫半晌，他用一只皱巴巴的手盲目地在胸前摸索，似乎要捻那已不复存在的胡须。“未来可以被预见吗？”他缓缓重复，“也许可以吧。古书中确有相应的魔法…然而陛下若是再问‘我们要不要预见未来呢？’对这个问题，我会肯定地回答‘不。’有的门还是永远关闭为好。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The next morning she broke her fast with Tommen. The boy seemed much subdued; ministering to Pate had served its purpose, it would seem. They ate fried eggs, fried bread, bacon, and some blood oranges newly come by ship from Dorne. Her son was attended by his kittens. As she watched the cats frolic about his feet, Cersei felt a little better. No harm will ever come to Tommen whilst I still live. She would kill half the lords in Westeros and all the common people, if that was what it took to keep him safe. "Go with Jocelyn," she told the boy after they had eaten.</div>

At the time she made the prophecy, the girl was one-and-ten, healthy as a little horse and safe within the Rock. Yet she soon fell down a well and drowned." Melara had begged her never to speak of the things they heard that night in the maegi's tent. If we never talk about it we'll soon forget, and then it will be just a bad dream we had, Melara had said. Bad dreams never come true. The both of them had been so young, that had sounded almost wise.</div>
