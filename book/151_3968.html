<div class="line_en">Okay, so I admit that the first day of school I was so nervous that the butterflies in my stomach were more like pigeons flying around my insides. Mom and Dad were probably a little nervous, too, but they acted all excited for me, taking pictures of me and Via before we left the house since it was Via's first day of school, too.</div>

<div class="line_en">Up until a few days before, we still weren't sure I would be going to school at all. After my tour of the school, Mom and Dad had reversed sides on whether I should go or not. Mom was now the one saying I shouldn't go and Dad was saying I should. Dad had told me he was really proud of how I'd handled myself with Julian and that I was turning into quite the strong man. And I heard him tell Mom that he now thought she had been right all along. But Mom, I could tell, wasn't so sure anymore. When Dad told her that he and Via wanted to walk me to school today, too, since it was on the way to the subway station, Mom seemed relieved that we would all be going together. And I guess I was, too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="直到前几天，我们依然拿不定主意我到底要不要上学。参观学校后，妈妈和爸爸在我该不该上学的问题上态度发生了逆转。现在妈妈成了说我不应该上学的那个人，而爸爸则认为我应该去上学。爸爸告诉我，他为我如何处理与朱利安的冲突感到非常自豪，我正在变成一个十足的男子汉。我还听见他对妈妈说，现在他觉得她一直都是对的。但是妈妈——我看得出来——却不那么坚定了。当爸爸告诉她，他和维娅今天也想陪我一起走到学校去，因为我的学校就在去地铁站的路上，我们全家可以一起走时，妈妈似乎松了一口气。我想，我也松了一口气。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We crossed Amesfort and turned up Heights Place: Via walked next to me like she usually does, and Mom and Dad were behind us. As soon as we turned the corner, we saw all the kids in front of the school -- hundreds of them talking to each other in little groups, laughing, or standing with their parents, who were talking with other parents. I kept my head way down.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们穿过阿默斯福特大街，来到高地广场。维娅像往常一样走在我身边，妈妈和爸爸跟在后面。一拐过街角，我们就看见簇拥在学校前面的所有学生——几百个人，或三三两两交头接耳，喜笑颜开，或站在父母身边，而他们的父母又在跟其他的父母喋喋不休。我一直低着头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Even though Beecher Prep is just a few blocks from our house, I've only been on that block a couple of times before. In general, I try to avoid blocks where there are lots of kids roaming around. On our block, everybody knows me and I know everybody. I know every brick and every tree trunk and every crack in the sidewalk. I know Mrs. Grimaldi, the lady who's always sitting by her window, and the old guy who walks up and down the street whistling like a bird. I know the deli on the corner where Mom gets our bagels, and the waitresses at the coffee shop who all call me "honey" and give me lollipops whenever they see me. I love my neighborhood of North River Heights, which is why it was so strange to be walking down these blocks feeling like it was all new to me suddenly. Amesfort Avenue, a street I've been down a million times, looked totally different for some reason. Full of people I never saw before, waiting for buses, pushing strollers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽然毕彻预科学校离我家只有几个街区，但我以前也只去过几次。一般情况下，我尽量避免去有许多孩子出没的街区。在我们这个街区，人人都认得我，我也认得每个人，我熟悉人行道上的每一块砖头，每一棵树，每一条裂缝。我熟悉格里马尔德太太，她总是靠窗坐着，还有那个一边走在大街上一边把口哨吹得像鸟叫的老头。我熟悉街角的熟食店，妈妈通常都在那里买百吉饼，还有咖啡店的女服务员，她们都叫我“甜心”，任何时候见到我，她们都会塞给我棒棒糖。我爱北河高地的邻居们，这也是为什么走在这几个街区显得如此陌生的原因，对我来说好像这里一下子变成了全新的地方。阿默斯福特大道，这条街道我已经走了无数遍，却不知何故看起来面目全非。人群熙攘，有的在等公交车，有的推着婴儿车漫步，可这些人我以前从来没见过。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I have to admit: so far, nothing bad had happened. I didn't catch anyone staring or even noticing me. Only once did I look up to see some girls looking my way and whispering with their hands cupped over their mouths, but they looked away when they saw me notice them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我得承认，到目前为止，还没有不好的事情发生。没发觉有人紧盯着我看，甚至没人注意到我。只有一瞬间，我抬头看见几个女孩正朝我看，捂着嘴窃窃私语，但当她们发现我注意到了她们时，就扭头看别处去了。">查看中文翻译</div>
