<div class="line_en">Hermione ploughed her way back to Hagrid's cabin through two feet of snow on Sunday morning. Harry and Ron wanted to go with her, but their mountain of homework had reached an alarming height again, so they remained grudgingly in the common room, Tying to ignore the gleeful shouts drifting up from the grounds outside, where students were enjoying themselves skating on the frozen lake, tobogganing and, worst of all, bewitching snowballs to zoom up to Gryffindor Tower and rap hard on the windows.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, I tried," she said dully, sinking into a chair beside Harry. She pulled out her wand and gave it a complicated little wave so that hot air streamed out of the tip; she then pointed this at her robes, which began to steam as they dried out. "He wasn't even there when I arrived, I was knocking for at least half an hour. And then he came stumping out of the Forest --"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我努力了，”她没精打采地说，坐进哈利旁边的椅子，抽出魔杖花样复杂地舞了一下，杖尖冒出热气。她用它指着自己的袍子，水汽从袍子上蒸发了出去。“我去的时候他都不在，我在门外敲门敲了至少半小时，他才从林子里走出来——”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No," said Hermione miserably. "He says he wants them to be a surprise. I tried to explain about Umbridge, but he just doesn't get it. He kept saying nobody in their right mind would rather study Knarls than Chimaeras -- oh, I don't think he's got a Chimaera," she added at the appalled look on Harry and Ron's faces, "but that's not for lack of trying, from what he said about how hard it is to get eggs. I don't know how many times I told him he'd be better off following Grubbly-Plank's plan, I honestly don't think he listened to half of what I said. He's in a bit of a funny mood, you know. He still won't say how he got all those injuries."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没有，”赫敏苦恼地说，“他说他要给我们一个惊喜。我想说明乌姆里奇的情况，可他就是听不进去。他一个劲儿说脑子正常的人都不会愿意研究刺佬儿而放弃客迈拉兽——哦，我想他没有客迈拉兽。”看到哈利和罗恩惊恐的表情，她赶紧加了一句：“但他不是没试过，他说那是因为他不容易弄到客迈拉的蛋…我不知多少次对他讲，用格拉普兰的教法更有利。可我真觉得他连一半都没听进去。你们知道，他有些怪怪的，还是不肯说他是怎么受的伤…”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry groaned. The Forbidden Forest was teeming with the kind of creatures most likely to get Hagrid the sack. "What's he keeping in there? Did he say?" he asked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利呻吟了一下，禁林里多的是容易让海格被解雇的生物。“他在那儿养了什么？他说了吗？”哈利问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Hagrid's reappearance at the staff table at breakfast next day was not greeted by enthusiasm from all students. Some, like Fred, George and Lee, roared with delight and sprinted up the aisle between the Gryffindor and Hufflepuff tables to wring Hagrid's enormous hand; others, like Parvati and Lavender, exchanged gloomy looks and shook their heads. Harry knew that many of them preferred Professor Grubbly-Planks lessons, and the worst of it was that a very small, unbiased part of him knew that they had good reason: Grubbly-Plank's idea of an interesting class was not one where there was a risk that somebody might have their head ripped off.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="海格第二天早饭时重新出现在教工桌子旁，并不是所有学生都反应热情。弗雷德、乔治和李等人热烈欢呼，冲到格兰芬多与赫奇帕奇桌子之间的过道上，拉着海格巨大的手掌握了又握。另一些人，像帕瓦蒂和拉文德等则郁闷地交换着眼色，摇着头。哈利知道他们许多人更喜欢格拉普兰教授的课。最糟糕的是，他心里有一小块公正的地方知道他们有理由：格拉普兰概念中有趣的课不是可能有人被揪掉脑袋的那种。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"We're working in here today!" Hagrid called happily to the approaching students, jerking his head back at the dark trees behind him. "Bit more sheltered! Anyway, they prefer the dark."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们今天在这儿上课！”海格愉快地对学生们说，把头朝身后的黑林子一摆，“林子密了点儿！不过，它们喜欢黑暗…”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was with a certain amount of apprehension that Harry, Ron and Hermione headed down to Hagrid's on Tuesday, heavily muffled against the cold. Harry was worried, not only about what Hagrid might have decided to teach them, but also about how the rest of the class, particularly Malfoy and his cronies, would behave if Umbridge was watching them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="星期二，哈利、罗恩和赫敏穿得严严实实地去上海格的课时，心里有些害怕。哈利不仅担心海格不知会教什么东西，还担心其他同学，尤其是马尔福及其心腹在乌姆里奇听课时的表现。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">However, the High Inquisitor was nowhere to be seen as they struggled through the snow towards Hagrid, who stood waiting for them on the edge of the Forest. He did not present a reassuring sight; the bruises that had been purple on Saturday night were now tinged with green and yellow and some of his cuts still seemed to be bleeding. Harry could not understand this: had Hagrid perhaps been attacked by some creature whose venom prevented the wounds it inflicted from healing? As though to complete the ominous picture, Hagrid was carrying what looked like half a dead cow over his shoulder.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，当他们在雪地上深一脚浅一脚地朝着等在林子边上的海格走去时，却没有看到高级调查官的影子。海格的样子不让人宽心，星期六夜里紫色的伤痕现在显出黄绿色，有些伤口好像还在流血。哈利不明白：难道海格受了什么怪兽的袭击，它的毒液能阻止伤口愈合？仿佛是为了完成这幅不祥的画面，海格肩上似乎还扛着半头死牛。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry remembered the only other occasion on which Malfoy had entered the Forest before now; he had not been very brave then, either. He smiled to himself; after the Quidditch match anything that caused Malfoy discomfort was all right with him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利想起马尔福以前惟一一次进这个林子的情形，那时他自己也不是很勇敢。哈利笑了，魁地奇比赛后凡是能让马尔福不自在的事情他都赞成。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Slytherins murmured agreement and a few Gryffindors looked as though they thought Malfoy had a fair point, too.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Ready?" said Hagrid cheerfully, looking around at the class. "Right, well, I've bin saving a trip inter the Forest fer yer fifth year. Thought we'd go and see these creatures in their natural habitat. Now, what we're studying today is pretty rare, I reckon I'm probably the on'y person in Britain who's managed ter train him."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“准备好了吗？”海格快活地扫视着全班说，“好。我为你们五年级留了一堂林中考察课，想让你们看看这些生物在自然环境中的生活。我们今天要学习的生物非常稀有，我想我可能是全英国惟一一个驯服它们的人——”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"And you're sure they're trained, are you?" said Malfoy, the panic in his voice even more pronounced. "Only it wouldn't be the first time you'd brought wild stuff to class, would it?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你肯定它们驯服了吗？”马尔福问，声音中的恐惧更明显了，“反正这不会是你第一次把野兽带到课堂上，对吧？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They walked for about ten minutes until they reached a place where the trees stood so closely together that it was as dark as twilight and there was no snow at all on the ground. With a grunt, Hagrid deposited his half a cow on the ground, stepped back and turned to face his class, most of whom were creeping from tree to tree towards him, peering around nervously as though expecting to be set upon at any moment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="走了大约十分钟，来到一处林木茂密、暗如黄昏的地方，地上一片雪也没有。海格吭哧一声把那半头牛撂在地上，退后两步，转身面对着全班同学。许多人都用树干做掩护，紧张地东张西望，小心翼翼地向他靠近，似乎在防备随时受到袭击。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"So what happened to your face, then?" demanded Malfoy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那你的脸是怎么回事？”马尔福问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Course they're trained," said Hagrid, scowling and hoisting the dead cow a little higher on his shoulder.</div>

<div class="line_en">He turned and strode straight into the Forest. Nobody seemed much disposed to follow. Harry glanced at Ron and Hermione, who sighed but nodded, and the three of them set off after Hagrid, leading the rest of the class.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他转身大步走进森林。大家似乎都不大愿意跟进去。哈利望望罗恩与赫敏，他们叹了口气，点点头。于是三人带头跟在海格后面。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He turned, shook his shaggy head to get the hair out of his face and gave an odd, shrieking cry that echoed through the dark trees like the call of some monstrous bird. Nobody laughed: most of them looked too scared to make a sound.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他转过身，摇摇脑袋甩开挡在脸上的头发，发出一种古怪的、尖厉的叫声，在幽暗的林子里回响，像是巨鸟的鸣叫。没有人笑，大部分人似乎都吓得不敢出声了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Hagrid gave the shrieking cry again. A minute passed in which the class continued to peer nervously over their shoulders and around trees for a first glimpse of whatever it was that was coming. And then, as Hagrid shook his hair back for a third lime and expanded his enormous chest, Harry nudged Ron and pointed into the black space between two gnarled yew trees.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="海格又叫了一声，一分钟过去了，学生们一直在紧张地窥视四周，不知道会出现什么。当海格第三次甩开头发、扩张他那宽大的胸脯时，哈利推推罗恩，指了指两棵粗虬紫杉之间的暗处。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A great wave of relief broke over Harry. Here at last was proof that he had not imagined these creatures, that they were real: Hagrid knew about them too. He looked eagerly at Ron, but Ron was still staring around into the trees and after a few seconds he whispered, "Why doesn't Hagrid call again?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利感到如释重负。现在终于证明这些神兽不是他的幻想，它们是真的：海格也知道。他急切地望着罗恩，但罗恩还在朝林间张望，过了片刻他小声问：“海格为什么不叫了？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A pair of blank, white, shining eyes were growing larger through the gloom and a moment later the dragonish face, neck and then skeletal body of a great, black, winged horse emerged from the darkness. It surveyed the class for a few seconds, swishing its long black tail, then bowed its head and began to tear flesh from the dead cow with its pointed fangs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一对发亮的白眼珠在那边渐渐变大，随后是龙一样的脸、颈子、骨骼毕露的身体，一匹巨大的、带翼的黑马从黑暗中显现出来。它朝学生们看了几秒钟，甩了甩长长的黑尾巴，然后低下头开始用尖牙撕咬死牛。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh, and here comes another one!" said Hagrid proudly, as a second black horse appeared out of the dark trees, folded its leathery-wings closer to its body and dipped its head to gorge on the meat. "Now… put yer hands up, who can see him?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，又来了一位！”海格自豪地说，第二匹黑马从林中出现了，收起皮革一样的翅膀，低头贪婪地吃起生肉，“现在…有谁看见了，举个手。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Most of the rest of the class were wearing expressions as confused and nervously expectant as Ron's and were still gazing everywhere but at the horse standing feet from them. There were only two other people who seemed to be able to see them: a stringy Slytherin boy standing just behind Goyle was watching the horse eating with an expression of great distaste on his face; and Neville, whose eyes were following the swishing progress of the long black tail.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大部分同学也带着罗恩一样困惑而紧张的表情东张西望，但就是看不到站在几英尺外的黑马。只有另外两人好像看到了：高尔身后一个瘦瘦的斯莱特林男生正在看黑马吃肉，脸上露出非常厌恶的表情；；纳威的目光在盯着那条不停甩动的长长黑尾。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For an answer, Hagrid pointed at the cow carcass on the ground. The whole class stared at it for a few seconds, then several people gasped and Parvati squealed. Harry understood why: bits of flesh stripping themselves away from the bones and vanishing into thin air had to look very odd indeed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="海格指了指地上的死牛作为回答。全班盯着它看了几秒钟，有几个人倒吸了一口冷气，帕瓦蒂尖叫起来。哈利知道为什么：一块块肉自动从骨头上剥离，消失在空气中，看上去一定非常诡异。">查看中文翻译</div>

In any case, he did not want to think about Christmas. For the first time in his school career, he very much wanted to spend the holidays away from Hogwarts. Between his Quidditch ban and worry about whether or not Hagrid was going to be put on probation, he felt highly resentful towards the place at the moment. The only thing he really looked forward to were the DA meetings, and they would have to stop over the holidays, as nearly everybody in the DA would be spending the time with their families. Hermione was going skiing with her parents, something that greatly amused Ron, who had never heard of Muggles strapping narrow strips of wood on to their feet to slide down mountains. Ron was going home to The Burrow. Harry endured several days of envy before Ron said, in response to Harry asking him how he was going to get home for Christmas: "But you're coming too! Didn't I say? Mum wrote and told me to invite you weeks ago!"</div>

<div class="line_en">Hermione rolled her eyes, but Harry's spirits soared: the thought of Christmas at The Burrow was truly wonderful, though slightly marred by Harry's guilty feeling that he would not be able to spend the holiday with Sirius. He wondered whether he could possibly persuade Mrs. Weasley to invite his godfather for the festivities. Even though he doubted whether Dumbledore would permit Sirius to leave Grimmauld Place anyway, he could not help but think Mrs. Weasley might not want him; they were so often at loggerheads. Sirius had not contacted Harry at all since his last appearance in the fire, and although Harry knew that with Umbridge on constant watch it would be unwise to attempt to contact him, he did not like to think of Sirius alone in his mother's old house, perhaps pulling a lonely cracker with Kreacher.</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry said nothing. Hermione's words opened up a whole new vista of frightening possibilities. He tried to imagine going somewhere with Cho -- Hogsmeade, perhaps -- and being alone with her for hours at a time. Of course, she would have been expecting him to ask her out after what had just happened… the thought made his stomach clench painfully.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ron said nothing, but looked disgruntled. They sat in silence for another twenty minutes, Ron finishing his Transfiguration essay with many snorts of impatience and crossings-out, Hermione writing steadily to the very end of the parchment, rolling it up carefully and sealing it, and Harry staring into the fire, wishing more than anything that Sirius's head would appear there and give him some advice about girls.

Cho was accusing him of luring her there under false pretences; she said he had promised her a hundred and fifty Chocolate Frog Cards if she showed up.

Then she turned into Hermione, who said, "You did promise her, you know, Harry… I think you'd better give her something else instead… how about your Firebolt?"
