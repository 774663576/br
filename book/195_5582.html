<div class="line_en">When they returned to London Philip began his dressing in the surgical wards. He was not so much interested in surgery as in medicine, which, a more empirical science, offered greater scope to the imagination. The work was a little harder than the corresponding work on the medical side. There was a lecture from nine till ten, when he went into the wards; there wounds had to be dressed, stitches taken out, bandages renewed: Philip prided himself a little on his skill in bandaging, and it amused him to wring a word of approval from a nurse. On certain afternoons in the week there were operations; and he stood in the well of the theatre, in a white jacket, ready to hand the operating surgeon any instrument he wanted or to sponge the blood away so that he could see what he was about. When some rare operation was to be performed the theatre would fill up, but generally there were not more than half a dozen students present, and then the proceedings had a cosiness which Philip enjoyed. At that time the world at large seemed to have a passion for appendicitis, and a good many cases came to the operating theatre for this complaint: the surgeon for whom Philip dressed was in friendly rivalry with a colleague as to which could remove an appendix in the shortest time and with the smallest incision.</div>

<div class="line_en">In due course Philip was put on accident duty. The dressers took this in turn; it lasted three days, during which they lived in hospital and ate their meals in the common-room; they had a room on the ground floor near the casualty ward, with a bed that shut up during the day into a cupboard. The dresser on duty had to be at hand day and night to see to any casualty that came in. You were on the move all the time, and not more than an hour or two passed during the night without the clanging of the bell just above your head which made you leap out of bed instinctively. Saturday night was of course the busiest time and the closing of the public-houses the busiest hour. Men would be brought in by the police dead drunk and it would be necessary to administer a stomach-pump; women, rather the worse for liquor themselves, would come in with a wound on the head or a bleeding nose which their husbands had given them: some would vow to have the law on him, and others, ashamed, would declare that it had been an accident. What the dresser could manage himself he did, but if there was anything important he sent for the house-surgeon: he did this with care, since the house-surgeon was not vastly pleased to be dragged down five flights of stairs for nothing. The cases ranged from a cut finger to a cut throat. Boys came in with hands mangled by some machine, men were brought who had been knocked down by a cab, and children who had broken a limb while playing: now and then attempted suicides were carried in by the police: Philip saw a ghastly, wild-eyed man with a great gash from ear to ear, and he was in the ward for weeks afterwards in charge of a constable, silent, angry because he was alive, and sullen; he made no secret of the fact that he would try again to kill himself as soon as he was released. The wards were crowded, and the house-surgeon was faced with a dilemma when patients were brought in by the police: if they were sent on to the station and died there disagreeable things were said in the papers; and it was very difficult sometimes to tell if a man was dying or drunk. Philip did not go to bed till he was tired out, so that he should not have the bother of getting up again in an hour; and he sat in the casualty ward talking in the intervals of work with the night-nurse. She was a gray-haired woman of masculine appearance, who had been night-nurse in the casualty department for twenty years. She liked the work because she was her own mistress and had no sister to bother her. Her movements were slow, but she was immensely capable and she never failed in an emergency. The dressers, often inexperienced or nervous, found her a tower of strength. She had seen thousands of them, and they made no impression upon her: she always called them Mr. Brown; and when they expostulated and told her their real names, she merely nodded and went on calling them Mr. Brown. It interested Philip to sit with her in the bare room, with its two horse-hair couches and the flaring gas, and listen to her. She had long ceased to look upon the people who came in as human beings; they were drunks, or broken arms, or cut throats. She took the vice and misery and cruelty of the world as a matter of course; she found nothing to praise or blame in human actions: she accepted. She had a certain grim humour.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="菲利普还要和其他做包扎员的同学轮流去急诊室值班，一值就是三天，在医院里住，在公共休息室吃饭。一楼的急诊病房边上有间给他们准备的屋子，里面的床白天收起来做橱柜用。值班的包扎员一早一晚都要随叫随到，负责照顾入院的急症病人。他们要一直到处走动，晚上不到一两个小时头顶的铃就要嗡嗡震一次，惊得人从床上一跃而起。周六晚上自然是最忙的一晚，而酒馆关门之后的那几个小时则是最忙的时刻。警察架着几个烂醉如泥的男人进了医院，这时候就要抓紧给他们上胃泵了；来医院的女人情况比醉汉还要严重，她们不是被丈夫打破了脑袋，就是被揍得一脸鼻血。有些人口口声声发誓要告到法院去，还有些羞于承认，只吞声咽气地说是自己不小心磕了碰了。包扎员自己能处理的就自己处理，情况太严重的话，只好派人去找住院科医生来：这种情况下必须考虑再三，住院科医生可不愿意大老远从五楼跑下来，结果发现只是些小病小伤。来医院的病人里从割了手指到割了喉咙，什么情况都有。男孩手卡在机器里拔不出来了、男人被马车撞倒了、孩子玩耍的时候摔了胳膊腿儿，偶尔还有警察抬着自杀的人送来急诊。菲利普亲眼见过一个怒目圆睁，表情狰狞的男人，脸上裂开一道大口子，从一只耳朵划到另一只。他在巡警的监护下在病房待了几个礼拜，一言不发，满脸阴郁，只因自己竟被人救下来了。他一点儿没隐瞒，大大方方地承认只要一出院就要再自杀一次。病房里永远都人满为患，警察带进来的病人怎么处理是个棘手问题，住院科医生对此左右为难：若是他们被送去警察局，结果死在那里，报纸上就会说些不好听的，而且，很难判断一个人到底是酩酊烂醉还是翘了辫子。菲利普一直工作到筋疲力尽才上床睡觉，这样他就不必在一个钟头之内又被吵起来。他坐在急诊病房里趁着工作间隙和夜班护士聊天。这个一头灰发的女人外貌有点像个男人，已经在急诊科做了二十年的夜班护士。她很喜欢这份工作，因为这里她说了算，没有其他护士来找麻烦。她虽动作慢吞吞的，但工作能力没的说，碰到紧急情况从来不会出乱子。包扎员往往没有经验，容易紧张，都视她为自己的精神支柱。她前前后后见过上千个这样的包扎员了，对他们毫无印象，她总是称呼包扎员为“布朗先生”。每次他们向她抗议，告诉她自己的真名时，她都点点头，然后继续称呼“布朗先生”。菲利普觉得和她坐在空荡荡的房间里挺有意思，四周只有两张铺着马尾衬布的长沙发和一盏火苗闪烁不定的汽灯。他静静听着她说话。她早就不把来医院的人当成人看了，他们不是大醉就是摔断了胳膊、割断了喉咙。这世上一切罪恶、不幸和残忍在她看来，不过尔尔。人的所作所为大多无须嘉奖或惩罚，只照单全收便好。她身上有种冷酷的幽默感。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes, he did all right. I could never make up my mind if it was suicide or not… They're a funny lot, suicides. I remember one man who couldn't get any work to do and his wife died, so he pawned his clothes and bought a revolver; but he made a mess of it, he only shot out an eye and he got all right. And then, if you please, with an eye gone and a piece of his face blow away, he came to the conclusion that the world wasn't such a bad place after all, and he lived happily ever afterwards. Thing I've always noticed, people don't commit suicide for love, as you'd expect, that's just a fancy of novelists; they commit suicide because they haven't got any money. I wonder why that is."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“死了，到底是死了。我不确定这究竟是自杀，还是……自杀的人很多。我还记得有这么个男人，找不着活干，老婆又死了。他把衣服都典当了，买了把左轮手枪。可一枪下去，人没死成，只把眼睛射瞎了。之后你猜怎么着，他少了一只眼，脸也没了一块，却发现世界没有他想象的那么糟糕，小日子反倒过得快活起来了。我发现啊，人才不会为了爱情自杀呢。你可能会这么想，但这只是小说家杜撰出来的。自杀的人无非是因为太穷了。不知道这是怎么回事。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Money was in any case occupying Philip's thoughts a good deal just then. He discovered the little truth there was in the airy saying which himself had repeated, that two could live as cheaply as one, and his expenses were beginning to worry him. Mildred was not a good manager, and it cost them as much to live as if they had eaten in restaurants; the child needed clothes, and Mildred boots, an umbrella, and other small things which it was impossible for her to do without. When they returned from Brighton she had announced her intention of getting a job, but she took no definite steps, and presently a bad cold laid her up for a fortnight. When she was well she answered one or two advertisements, but nothing came of it: either she arrived too late and the vacant place was filled, or the work was more than she felt strong enough to do. Once she got an offer, but the wages were only fourteen shillings a week, and she thought she was worth more than that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如今，他想了很多关于钱的事。他发现自己大话说早了，两个人过日子的花销远远多于一个人，这段时间的支出让他很是发愁。米尔德里德不是个好管家，在家做饭的费用几乎和下馆子一样多；孩子要买衣服，她要买靴子、雨伞和其他没了活不了的小物件。从布莱顿回来以后，她嘴上说着想找份工作，却一直迟迟没有动静。后来得了重感冒，又耽误了两个礼拜。等身体康复了，她去面试了一两个工作，可要不就是到得太晚，职位被别人抢先，要不就是工作强度太大，她觉得自己干不了。有次，好不容易找到一个活，但一周的工钱只有十四先令，她想自己不该只挣这么一点儿。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He could not help thinking how useful it would be towards the expenses of the household, and Mildred was already beginning to hint that she did not get a place because she had not got a decent dress to interview employers in. He gave her the dress, and she made one or two more attempts, but Philip came to the conclusion that they were not serious. She did not want to work. The only way he knew to make money was on the Stock Exchange, and he was very anxious to repeat the lucky experiment of the summer; but war had broken out with the Transvaal and nothing was doing in South Africans. Macalister told him that Redvers Buller would march into Pretoria in a month and then everything would boom. The only thing was to wait patiently. What they wanted was a British reverse to knock things down a bit, and then it might be worth while buying. Philip began reading assiduously the `city chat' of his favourite newspaper. He was worried and irritable. Once or twice he spoke sharply to Mildred, and since she was neither tactful nor patient she answered with temper, and they quarrelled. Philip always expressed his regret for what he had said, but Mildred had not a forgiving nature, and she would sulk for a couple of days. She got on his nerves in all sorts of ways; by the manner in which she ate, and by the untidiness which made her leave articles of clothing about their sitting-room: Philip was excited by the war and devoured the papers, morning and evening; but she took no interest in anything that happened. She had made the acquaintance of two or three people who lived in the street, and one of them had asked if she would like the curate to call on her. She wore a wedding-ring and called herself Mrs. Carey. On Philip's walls were two or three of the drawings which he had made in Paris, nudes, two of women and one of Miguel Ajuria, standing very square on his feet, with clenched fists. Philip kept them because they were the best things he had done, and they reminded him of happy days. Mildred had long looked at them with disfavour.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他禁不住想到这笔钱对他们用处有多大，米尔德里德开始旁敲侧击地说她之所以找不到工作就是因为面试的时候没有一条得体的裙子穿。菲利普给她买了裙子，她又想要其他东西，但菲利普说那些都不是必需的。她只是不想工作罢了。再说菲利普，他知道的唯一的生财之道就是炒股，迫不及待地想再像夏天那样来次幸运的赌博，发笔意外之财。可正逢德兰士瓦爆发战争，南非经济陷入一片困顿。麦卡利斯特告诉他不出一个月雷德福斯·布勒上将就会行军至比勒陀利亚，到那时行情便会大涨。现在能做的只有耐心等待了。他们想要英国打场败仗，这样物价就会下跌，正好合适买进股票。为了了解行情，菲利普开始认真研究起他最喜欢的报纸上的“市井趣谈”板块，心里又急又气，还冲米尔德里德大嚷过一两次，说了些不好听的话。而米尔德里德既不圆滑又没耐心，也气急败坏地顶嘴回去，两个人便开始吵架。过后，菲利普总会为自己说过的话道歉，但米尔德里德有个得理不饶人的性格，每次都要阴着脸，闷闷不乐好几天。她的一举一动都能激怒菲利普；不管是吃饭的样子，还是在客厅把衣服丢得乱七八糟的作风。菲利普近来很关注战争新闻，一早一晚只要报纸一到就如饥似渴地阅读起来。米尔德里德则是一副两耳不闻窗外事的态度。她认识了两三个住在这条街上的人，其中一个还问她需不需要副牧师上门。她只好戴上结婚戒指，自称是凯利夫人。菲利普家的墙上挂着两三幅他在巴黎画的画，分别是两三个男人的赤裸肖像，其中一个就是米盖尔·阿胡利亚。画中的他笔直地站立，双拳紧握。菲利普觉得这些是自己最好的作品，所以一直留着，每次看到就会想起在巴黎的快乐日子。米尔德里德早就看它们不顺眼了。">查看中文翻译</div>

Christmas came, and with it a couple of days holiday for Philip. He brought some holly in and decorated the flat, and on Christmas Day he gave small presents to Mildred and the baby. There were only two of them so they could not have a turkey, but Mildred roasted a chicken and boiled a Christmas pudding which she had bought at a local grocer's. They stood themselves a bottle of wine. When they had dined Philip sat in his arm-chair by the fire, smoking his pipe; and the unaccustomed wine had made him forget for a while the anxiety about money which was so constantly with him. He felt happy and comfortable. Presently Mildred came in to tell him that the baby wanted him to kiss her good-night, and with a smile he went into Mildred's bed-room. Then, telling the child to go to sleep, he turned down the gas and, leaving the door open in case she cried, went back into the sitting-room.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你不生我的气了吧？”她垂下眼帘，忽然问了一句。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I've never cared for you as I do now. It's only since I passed through the fire that I've learnt to love you." It chilled Philip to hear her make use of the sort of phrase she read in the penny novelettes which she devoured. Then he wondered whether what she said had any meaning for her: perhaps she knew no other way to express her genuine feelings than the stilted language of The Family Herald.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我从没像现在这样喜欢过你，直到经过大风大浪才学着来爱你。”菲利普起了一身鸡皮疙瘩。他知道这句话不过是她从廉价小说里照搬过来的，心里很失望。她在说这些话时到底是怎么想的，无从得知。也许除了从《家庭先驱报》上读来的生硬情话，她还真不知道怎么表达自己内心的感情呢。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He did not answer, and she laid her cheek against his hand.</div>

<div class="line_en">He did not reply for quite a long time, and silence fell upon them again; but at last he spoke and seemed conscious of no interval.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="菲利普好半天没说话，两个人又陷入一片沉默。最后，他终于开了口，一口气说了下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You mustn't be angry with me. One can't help these things. I remember that I thought you wicked and cruel because you did this, that, and the other; but it was very silly of me. You didn't love me, and it was absurd to blame you for that. I thought I could make you love me, but I know now that was impossible. I don't know what it is that makes someone love you, but whatever it is, it's the only thing that matters, and if it isn't there you won't create it by kindness, or generosity, or anything of that sort."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你千万不要生我的气。这事谁都没办法的。我记得自己曾经因为你的所作所为而觉得你是个恶毒残忍的女人。但我太傻了。你只是不爱我罢了，我不能因为这点就怪罪于你。我以为能让你爱上我，但是我现在知道了，这根本就不可能。我不知道怎么才能让一个人爱上自己。不管用什么法子，爱才是最重要的。如果没有爱，再善良、再慷慨、为他们付出再多，都无济于事。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I should have thought so too. I remember how I used to think that it would last for ever, I felt I would rather die than be without you, and I used to long for the time when you would be faded and wrinkled so that nobody cared for you any more and I should have you all to myself."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我本来也该这么想。我也以为对你的爱会一直不变，宁愿去死也不想失去你。我曾经期盼着有一天你老了，满脸皱纹，别人都不喜欢你了，这样你就只属于我一个人了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
