<div class="line_en">Madam Pomfrey insisted on keeping Harry in the hospital wing for the rest of the weekend. He didn't argue or complain, but he wouldn't let her throw away the shattered remnants of his Nimbus Two Thousand. He knew he was being stupid, knew that the Nimbus was beyond repair, but Harry couldn't help it; he felt as though he'd lost one of his best friends.</div>

<div class="line_en">He hadn't told anyone about the Grim, not even Ron -- and Hermione, because he knew Ron would panic and Hermione would scoff. The fact remained, however, that it had now appeared twice, and both appearances had been followed by near-fatal accidents; the first time, he had nearly been run over by the Knight Bus; the second, fallen fifty feet from his broomstick. Was the Grim going to haunt him until he actually died? Was he going to spend the rest of his life looking over his shoulder for the beast?</div>

<div class="line_en">He had a stream of visitors, all intent on cheering him up. Hagrid sent him a bunch of earwiggy flowers that looked like yellow cabbages, and Ginny Weasley, blushing furiously, turned up with a get-well card she had made herself, which sang shrilly unless Harry kept it shut under his bowl of fruit. The Gryffindor team visited again on Sunday morning, this time accompanied by Wood, who told Harry (in a hollow, dead sort of voice) that he didn't blame him in the slightest. Ron and Hermione left Harry's bedside only at night -- But nothing anyone said or did could make Harry feel any better, because they knew only half of what was troubling him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="许多人来看他，都一心一意想让他高兴起来。海格送给他一束地蜈蚣花，看上去像是黄色的大白菜；金妮韦斯莱来的时候满脸通红，给了他一张自制的康复卡，如果哈利不把这张卡闭拢并且把它压在碗碟或是水果下面，它就会尖声唱起歌来。格兰芬多球队的队员星期天早上又来看哈利了，这次伍德也来了，伍德嗓音空洞、全无生气，他对哈利说，他一点儿也不怪哈利。罗恩和赫敏只是到了晚上才离开哈利床边。但是，不管别人说什么做什么，都不能让哈利觉得好过一点儿，因为人们所知道的只是他烦恼的一半而已。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Because Harry knew who that screaming voice belonged to now. He had heard her words, heard them over and over again during the night hours in the hospital wing while he lay awake, staring at the strips of moonlight on the ceiling. When the dementors approached him, he heard the last moments of his mother's life, her attempts to protect him, Harry, from Lord Voldemort, and Voldemort's laughter before he murdered her… Harry dozed fitfully, sinking into dreams full of clammy, rotted hands and petrified pleading, jerking awake to dwell again on his mother's voice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因为现在哈利知道那是谁的声音了。夜里，他躺在医院里，醒着，瞪眼看着天花板上一道道的月光。这时候，他昕到了她的话，听到这些话一次又一次地重复着。那些摄魂怪走近他的时候，他听到了妈妈临终时的声音。她努力保护他，不让他受到伏地魔的伤害；他还听到了伏地魔在杀死妈妈以前的笑声…哈利时不时地睡过去，在睡眠中做着梦：到处是潮湿黏滑、已经腐烂的手和令人毛骨悚然的乞求声。他一下子惊醒了，却又听到了妈妈的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And then there were the dementors. Harry felt sick and humiliated every time he thought of them. Everyone said the dementors were horrible, but no one else collapsed every time they went near one. No one else heard echoes in their head of their dying parents.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后还有那些摄魂怪。每次想起它们，哈利都觉得恶心和羞辱。大家都说它们可怕，但是别人谁也没有像他那样，它们一走近就昏倒呀…别人谁也没有在脑子里反复听到正要死去的父母的说话声呀。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was a relief to return to the noise and bustle of the main school on Monday, where he was forced to think about other things, eve', if he had to endure Draco Malfoys taunting. Malfoy was almost beside himself with glee at Gryffindor's defeat. He had finally taken off his bandages, and celebrated having the full use of both arms again by doing spirited imitations of Harry falling off his broom. Malfoy spent much of their next Potions class doing dementor imitations across the dungeon; Ron finally cracked and flung a large, slippery crocodile heart at Malfoy, which hit him in the face and caused Snape to take fifty points from Gryffindor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="星期一，哈利回到了学校本部的喧闹忙碌之中，这真让他松了一口气。尽管他还要忍受马尔福的奚落，但在学校里他只能想其他事情。马尔福看到格兰芬多球赛失败。高兴得几乎要发狂了。他终于拿掉了绷带，精神饱满地模仿哈利从飞天扫帚上跌下来的样子，以此来庆祝他又可以充分使用两条胳膊了。在以后的魔药课上，马尔福有许多次穿过城堡主楼都要模仿那些摄魂怪；罗恩最后发怒了，把一个又大又滑的鳄鱼心脏对准马尔福扔了过去，正扔中他的脸，气得斯内普扣了格兰芬多五十分。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Lupin looked at him quickly. "Yes, I did. I don't think any of us have seen Professor Dumbledore that angry. They have been growing restless for some time -- furious at his refusal to let them inside the grounds… I suppose they were the reason you fell?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卢平迅速看了他一眼。“对，听说了。我想，我们谁也没有见过邓布利多教授那样发怒。一些日子以来，那些家伙越来越不安定了…因为不能进入校园怒气冲冲…我想是它们弄得你掉下来的吧？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你也听说了那些摄魂怪吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Lupin sighed. "They planted the Whomping Willow the same year that I arrived at Hogwarts. People used to play a game, trying to get near enough to touch the trunk. In the end, a boy called Davey Gudgeon nearly lost an eye, and we were forbidden to go near it. No broomstick would have a chance."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卢平叹了口气。“我到霍格沃茨的那一年，他们种了这棵树。人们过去时常玩一种游戏。就是试着去碰那棵树。最后，一个叫做戴维格杰恩的男孩几乎丢掉了一只眼睛，后来就不让我们走近那棵树了。飞天扫帚当然不能幸免啦。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It has nothing to do with weakness," said Professor Lupin sharply, as though he had read Harry's mind. "The dementors affect you worse than the others because there are horrors in your past that the others don't have."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这和软弱没有关系。”卢平教授尖锐地说。好像一眼看穿了哈利在想些什么。“那些摄魂怪对你的影响比对别人厉害，那是因为别人没有你以前有过的恐怖感觉。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“它们为什么要到比赛场地来呢？”哈利痛苦地问道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"They're getting hungry," said Lupin coolly, shutting his briefcase with a snap. "Dumbledore won't let them into the school, so their supply of human prey has dried up… I don't think they could resist the large crowd around the Quidditch field. All that excitement… emotions running high… it was their idea of a feast."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“它们饿了。”卢平冷淡地说，啪的一声关上了他的公文包。“邓布利多不让它们进入学校，所以供给它们的人类牺牲品就用完了。我认为魁地奇比赛场周围的大批人群对它们是很大的诱惑。所有那些兴奋…激情高涨…在它们看来就是一场盛宴。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Dementors are among the foulest creatures that walk this earth. They infest the darkest, filthiest places, they glory in decay and despair, they drain peace, hope, and happiness out of the air around them. Even Muggles feel their presence, though they can't see them. Get too near a dementor and every good feeling, every happy memory will be sucked out of you. If it can, the dementor will feed on you long enough to reduce you to something like itself… soul-less and evil. You'll be left with nothing but the worst experiences of your life. And the worst that happened to you, Harry, is enough to make anyone fall off their broom. You have nothing to feel ashamed of."</div>

<div class="line_en">What with the promise of anti-dementor lessons from Lupin, the thought that he might never have to hear his mother's death again, and the fact that Ravenclaw flattened Hufflepuff in their Quidditch match at the end of November, Harry's mood took a definite upturn. Gryffindor were not out of the running after all, although they could not afford to lose another match. Wood became repossessed of his manic energy, and worked his team as hard as ever in the chilly haze of rain that persisted into December. Harry saw no hint of a dementor within the grounds. Dumbledore's anger seemed to be keeping them at their stations at the entrances.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卢平答应教哈利妇何防御摄魂怪，哈利认为自己也许再也不会听到妈妈临死前的声音了。十一月底拉文克劳队打败了赫奇帕奇队。这些事加在一起，使哈利的情绪明显高涨起来。格兰芬多队毕竟还有比赛的机会，尽管他们现在可不能再输一场球了。伍德又精力充沛起来，在一直延续到十二月的寒冷刺骨的风雨中仍旧不遗余力地抓紧训练他的球队。哈利在校园里没有看到任何摄魂怪的踪迹。邓布利多的怒火似乎把它们限制在学校入口处的岗位上了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Two weeks before the end of the term, the sky lightened suddenly to a dazzling, opaline white and the muddy grounds were revealed one morning covered in glittering frost. Inside the castle, there was a buzz of Christmas in the air. Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, had already decorated his classroom with shimmering lights that turned out to be real, fluttering fairies. The students were all happily discussing their plans for the holidays. Both Ron and Hermione had decided to remain at Hogwarts, and though Ron said it was because he couldn't stand two weeks with Percy, and Hermione insisted she needed to use the library, Harry wasn't fooled; they were doing it to keep him company, and he was very grateful.</div>
