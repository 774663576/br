<div class="line_en">Arya stiffened, still as stone, listening, the three stringy carrots in her hand suddenly forgotten. She thought of the Bloody Mummers and Roose Bolton's men, and a shiver of fear went down her back. It's not fair, not when we finally found the Trident, not when we thought we were almost safe.</div>

<div class="line_en">Arya rose, carrots dangling from her hand. It sounded like the singer was coming up the river road. Over among the cabbages, Hot Pie had heard it too, to judge by the look on his face. Gendry had gone to sleep in the shade of the burned cottage, and was past hearing anything.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="艾莉亚站起身，胡萝卜在手中摇晃。唱歌的人似乎正沿河边小路走来。从表情看得出，拔白菜的热派也听见了。当然，詹德利在烧毁农舍的阴影里睡觉，毫无反应。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Where? The burned cottage and its overgrown garden stood hard beside the banks of the Trident. There were a few willows growing along the river's edge and reed beds in the muddy shallows beyond, but most of the ground hereabouts was painfully open. I knew we should never have left the woods, she thought. They'd been so hungry, though, and the garden had been too much a temptation. The bread and cheese they had stolen from Harrenhal had given out six days ago, back in the thick of the woods. "Take Gendry and the horses behind the cottage," she decided. There was part of one wall still standing, big enough, maybe, to conceal two boys and three horses. If the horses don't whinny, and that singer doesn't come poking around the garden.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="躲到哪里去呢？烧毁殆尽的农舍和野草疯长的花园醒目地矗立在三叉戟河边，河畔还有几棵柳树，以及芦苇丛生的烂泥浅滩，除此之外，全是讨厌的开阔地。我就知道我们不该离开树林，她心想。但他们好饿，从赫伦堡偷出来的面包与奶酪六天前就在森林里吃光了，因此花园的诱惑实在太大。“把詹德利和马带到农舍背后，”她下定决心。那堵墙还没完全垮塌，说不定能藏住两个男孩和三匹马——假如马儿不叫，歌手也不往这边走的话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Go wake Gendry," Arya told him. "Just shake him by the shoulder, don't make a lot of noise." Gendry was easy to wake, unlike Hot Pie, who needed to be kicked and shouted at.</div>

<div class="line_en">Lightfoot, she moved to the big old willow that grew beside the bend in the road and went to one knee in the grass and mud, within the veil of trailing branches. You old gods, she prayed as the singer's voice grew louder, you tree gods, hide me, and make him go past. Then a horse whickered, and the song broke off suddenly. He's heard, she knew, but maybe he's alone, or if he's not, maybe they'll be as scared of us as we are of them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她蹑手蹑脚地走到那棵长在小路拐弯处的老柳树边，单膝跪在青草和泥土中，以摇曳的柳枝作为掩护。远古诸神啊，她祈祷，歌手则继续逼近，树的神，请保护我，隐藏我，让他过去，让他过去…一匹马嘶叫起来，歌声嘎然而止。他听见了，她对此不抱幻想，但或许就一个人，就算不是，说不定他们怕我们就跟我们怕他们一样呢。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Hot Pie went, and Arya dropped her carrots and drew the stolen sword from over her shoulder. She had strapped the sheath across her back; the longsword was made for a man grown, and it bumped against the ground when she wore it on her hip. It's too heavy besides, she thought, missing Needle the way she did every time she took this clumsy thing in her hand. But it was a sword and she could kill with it, that was enough.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="热派听话离开，艾莉亚扔下胡萝卜，从背后拔出偷来的剑。她把剑鞘绑在背上，因为它是给成年男子打的，与她尺寸不合，佩在腰间的话，会撞到地面。它实在太重了，每次拿起这笨家伙，她便会想念“缝衣针”。好歹它可以杀人，这就够了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They were men afoot, travel-stained and mud-specked. She knew the singer by the woodharp he cradled against his jerkin, as a mother might cradle a babe. A small man, fifty from the look of him, he had a big mouth, a sharp nose, and thinning brown hair. His faded greens were mended here and there with old leather patches, and he wore a brace of throwing knives on his hip and a woodman's axe slung across his back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="三人皆为徒步，身上泥斑点点，风尘仆仆。她认出那个唱歌的，因为他抱着一把木竖琴，好像母亲抱着孩子。他个子小，年纪约莫五十岁，嘴巴大，鼻子尖，棕色的头发十分稀疏，褪色的绿衣服上到处用旧皮革打着补丁。他腰间别了一圈飞刀，背后悬一把伐木工的斧头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The man beside him stood a good foot taller, and had the look of a soldier. A longsword and dirk hung from his studded leather belt, rows of overlapping steel rings were sewn onto his shirt, and his head was covered by a black iron halfhelm shaped like a cone. He had bad teeth and a bushy brown beard, but it was his hooded yellow cloak that drew the eye. Thick and heavy, stained here with grass and there with blood, frayed along the bottom and patched with deerskin on the right shoulder, the greatcloak gave the big man the look of some huge yellow bird.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="站他旁边的人比他高出一尺，外貌像个兵。镶钉皮革剑带上挂一把长剑和一把匕首，衬衫缝了排排交叠的铁环，头戴一顶锥形黑铁半盔。他牙齿很黄，还有一把浓密的黄褐胡须，最引人注目的是那身带兜帽的亮黄斗篷。它又厚又沉，沾了青草和鲜血，下沿已被磨损，右肩用鹿皮打个补丁。这顶大斗篷穿在大个子身上，使他看上去象只黄色巨鸟。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The last of the three was a youth as skinny as his longbow, if not quite as tall.

His arrows were fletched with grey goose feathers, and six of them stood in the ground before him, like a little fence.</div>
