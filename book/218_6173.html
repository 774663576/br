<div class="line_en">So in response to the question "How do I start?" I offer the thought process I go through on a day-by-day basis. It really is easy to find great deals. I promise you that. It's just like riding a bike. After a little wobbling, it's a piece of cake. But when it comes to money, it's the determination to get through the wobbling that's a personal thing.</div>

<div class="line_en">To find million-dollar "deals of a lifetime" requires us to call on our financial genius. I believe that each of us has a financial genius within us. The problem is, our financial genius lies asleep, waiting to be called upon. It lies asleep because our culture has educated us into believing that the love of money is the root of all evil. It has encouraged us to learn a profession so we can work for money, but failed to teach us how to have money work for us. It taught us not to worry about our financial future, our company or the government would take care of us when our working days are over. However, it is our children, educated in the same school system, who will end up paying for it. The message is still to work hard, earn money and spend it, and when we run short, we can always borrow more.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是要找到一桩数百万美元的“关系一生的机会”，就需要唤醒我们自己的财务天赋了。我相信，我们每个人都拥有内在的理财天赋，问题是，这种理财天赋一直处于休眠状态。这种天赋处于休眠状态的原因，是因为我们的文化把对金钱的需要视为万恶之源，并把这种观念灌输给了我们，这种观念促使我们学习某种技能，并为金钱而工作，却没能教给我们如何让金钱来为我们而工作。我们被告知不必去担忧将来的财务状况，因为一旦我们退休了，公司或者政府会照顾我们。然而，现在在同样的学校体制下受教育的我们的孩子们，他们将来却有可能不再向公司和政府支付提供这种照顾所需要的钱。可现有的信息仍告诉我们努力工作，挣钱维生，当缺钱时，我们总能借到钱。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">1. I NEED A REASON GREATER THAN REALITY: The power of spirit. If you ask most people if they would like to be rich or financially free, they would say "yes." But then reality sets in. The road seems too long with too many hills to climb. It's easier to just work for money and hand the excess over to your broker. I once met a young woman who had dreams of swimming for the U. S Olympic team. The reality was, she had to get up every morning at 4 a. m. to swim for three hours before going to school. She did not party with her friends on Saturday night. She had to study and keep her grades up, just like everyone else.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="1、我需要一个超现实的理由：精神的力量。如果你问别人是否愿意致富或者获得财务上的自由，大部人会说“愿意”。 可是一想到现实，前进的道路似乎就变得很漫长而崎岖，相比之下，为了钱工作并把剩余的钱托付给经纪人看管似乎要更容易一些。 我曾经遇到一位梦想参加美国奥林匹克游泳队的女运动员。为此，她不得不每天早上四点起床，游泳三个小时，然后去上学。她在周末也不和朋友们开晚会，而且她还必须拿出。时间去复习功课以保持学习进度。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When I asked her what compelled her with such super-human ambition and sacrifice, she simply said, "I do it for myself and the people I love. It's love that gets me over the hurdles and sacrifices."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当我问是什么力量驱使她以超人的雄心和牺牲精神这么做时，她只是说：“我这样做是为了自己以及我所爱的人们，是爱的力量使我以牺牲精神去克服重重困难。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A reason or a purpose is a combination of "wants" and "don't wants." When people ask me what my reason for wanting to be rich is, it is a combination of deep emotional "wants" and "don't wants."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这一原因或目的是“想要”和“不想要”的结合体。当人们问我想要致富的原因是什么，我就说这是感情上“想要”和“不想要”的结合。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I will list a few. First the "don't wants," for they create the "wants." I don't want to work all my life. I don't want what my parents aspired for, which was job security and a house in the suburbs. I don't like being an employee. I hated that my dad always missed my football games because he was so busy working on his career. I hated it when my dad worked hard all his life and the government took most of what he worked for at his death. He could not even pass on what he worked so hard for when he died. The rich don't do that. They work hard and pass it on to their children.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我可以列举一些首先是“不想要”而由此产生了“想要”的例子。我不想一生都工作；我不想要父辈们渴望的那些东西，如工作稳定、拥有一套郊区房子；我不想做一个打工仔；我讨厌父亲因为忙于工作而总是错过我的足球比赛；我讨厌父亲终身努力工作在他去世时却还有未付的账单。而富人不会那样做，他们会努力工作，然后将工作成果交给后人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Most people choose not to be rich. For 90 percent of the population, being rich is "too much of a hassle." So they invent sayings that go, "I'm not interested in money." Or "I'll never be rich." Or "I don't have to worry, I'm still young." Or "When I make some money, then I'll think about my future." Or "My husband/wife handles the finances." The problem with those statements is they rob the person who chooses to think such thoughts of two things: one is time, which is your most precious asset, and two is learning. Just because you have no money, should not be an excuse to not learn. But that is a choice we all make daily, the choice of what we do with our time, our money and what we put in our heads. That is the power of choice. All of us have choice. I just choose to be rich, and I make that choice every day.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大部分人不会选择成为富人，对于90％的人来说，做一个富人会有“太多烦扰”，所以他们就说，“我对金钱不感兴趣”，或者“我不想成为富人”，抑或“我不用担心，我还年轻”、“等我开始挣钱时，再考虑将来”，或者“我爱人掌握财权”等等。这些说法存在着一个共同的问题就是阻碍人们选择去思考这样两件事情：第一是时间，这是你最珍贵的资产；第二则是学习，因为你没有钱，你更要去学习。事实上我们每天都应该进行一个选择：即选择如何利用自己的时间、自己的金钱以及我们头脑里所学到的东西去实现我们的目标，这就是选择的力量。我们都有机会，我选择要做一个富人，我每天都在为我的选择而努力。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The benefit I had as a boy was that I loved playing Monopoly constantly. Nobody told me Monopoly was only for kids, so I just kept playing the game as an adult. I also had a rich dad who pointed out to me the difference between an asset and a liability. So a long time ago, as a little boy, I chose to be rich, and I knew that all I had to do was learn to acquire assets, real assets. My best friend, Mike, had an asset column handed to him, but he still had to choose to learn to keep it. Many rich families lose their assets in the next generation simply because there was no one trained to be a good steward over their assets.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="作为一个孩子的好处就是我可以一直玩“大富翁”游戏。但是因为没有谁跟我说过“大富翁”只有孩子才能玩，所以成年后我仍然爱玩这个游戏。富爸爸曾经通过游戏给我指出资产和负债之间的差别，所以当我还是一个小孩子时，我就选择要成为游戏中那样的富人，而且我知道自己所要做的就是学会像游戏中那样不断地进行投资，去获取更多资产——真正的资产。我最好的朋友迈克接管了他父亲的资产，但他仍要学会管理资产。许多富裕家庭之所以“富不过三代”，就是因为他们没有培养出一位内行的人来管理他们的资产。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">INVEST FIRST IN EDUCATION: In reality, the only real asset you have is your mind, the most powerful tool we have dominion over. Just as I said about the power of choice, each of us has the choice of what we put in our brain once we're old enough. You can watch MTV all day, or read golf magazines, or go to ceramics class or a class on financial planning. You choose. Most people simply buy investments rather than first invest in learning about investing.</div>

<div class="line_en">I love audio tapes. The reason: I can rewind quickly. I was listening to a tape by Peter Lynch, and he said something I completely disagreed with. Instead of becoming arrogant and critical, I simply pushed "rewind" and I listened to that five-minute stretch of tape at least twenty times. Possibly more. But suddenly, by keeping my mind open, I understood why he said what he said. It was like magic. I felt like I had a window into the mind of one of the greatest investors of our time. I gained tremendous depth and insight into the vast resources of his education and experience.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我喜欢听录音带，原因是录音带可以快速重放。我曾经听过彼得。林奇的一盘录音带，里面有一段话我完全不同意。但是，我并没有因此而妄自尊大，而是按“重放”键把这一段5分钟的话听了至少20遍，也许更多遍。忽然之间，我打开了自己的思路，懂得了他说的那些话的道理。这简直就像魔术一样，我感到如同打开了一扇通向我们这个时代最伟大的投资家之一的思想之窗。由此我得以深人认识和理解他那博大精深的学识和经验，从中获得了巨大的教益。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The net result: I still have the old way I used to think, and I have Peter's way of looking at the same problem or situation. I have two thoughts instead of one. One more way to analyze a problem or trend, and that is priceless. Today, I often say, "How would Peter Lynch do this, or Donald Trump or Warren Buffett or George Soros?" The only way I can access their vast mental power is to be humble enough to read or listen to what they have to say. Arrogant or critical people are often people with low self-esteem who are afraid of taking risks. You see, if you learn something new, you are then required to make mistakes in order to fully understand what you have learned.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最直接的结果是：我仍然保留住了自己过去思考问题的习惯方式，同时又学到了彼得。林奇分析同一问题或形势的思考方式。 我拥有了两条思路，而不仅仅是一条，能够有不止一条的思路来分析某个问题或趋势，这实在难能可贵。今天我常常会问自己，“这件事彼得。林奇会怎样做？或者唐纳德。特拉姆、沃伦。巴菲特、乔治。索罗斯会怎么做？”我得以进入他们深邃思想的惟一途径就是非常谦虚地阅读或倾听他们所说过的那些话。傲慢自大或吹毛求疵的人往往是缺乏自信而不敢冒风险的人。如果你想学习某些新东西，那么你就需要犯些错误，只有这样才能充分理解你所学习的知识。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There are so many "intelligent" people who argue or defend when a new idea clashes with the way they think. In this case, their so-called "intelligence" combined with "arrogance" equals "ignorance". Each of us knows people who are highly educated, or believe they are smart, but their balance sheet paints a different picture. A truly intelligent person welcomes new ideas, for new ideas can add to the synergy of other accumulated ideas. Listening is more important than talking. If that was not true, God would not have given us two ears and only one mouth. Too many people think with their mouth instead of listening to absorb new ideas and possibilities. They argue instead of asking questions.</div>

One expert will say the market is going to crash, and the other will say it's going to boom. If you're smart, you listen to both. Keep your mind open because both have valid points. Unfortunately, most poor people listen to "Chicken Little."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哥伦比亚全国广播公司的节目有很多有关投资方面信息的栏目。如果你看过他们的节目，通常会见到一帮所谓的“专家”在争吵。一位专家会说市场正在走向衰退，而另一位则声称市场正在趋于繁荣。如果你很精明，两方的话你都要听，保持一种开放的心态，因为两种说法都有合理的地方。不幸的是，大部分穷人只都听从“小鸡”式的观点。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A WARNING: Don't listen to poor or frightened people. I have such friends, and I love them dearly, but they are the "Chicken Littles" of life. When it comes to money, especially investments, "The sky is always falling." They can always tell you why something won't work. The problem is, people listen to them, but people who blindly accept doom-and-gloom information are also "Chicken Littles." As that old saying goes, "Chickens of a feather agree together."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="注意：不要听胆小的人说的话。我有这样的朋友，我非常喜欢他们，但他们过的是“小鸡”式的生活。一旦涉及到金钱，特别是投资时，“天就要塌下来了”，他们总是会告诉你一件事为什么不行。问题是如果人们听了他们的话，盲目地接受这种杞人忧天的信息，你最终也会成为“小鸡”式的人物。就像一句古老的谚语所说的：“小鸡的毛都是一样的”。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I have several friends who have generated over a billion dollars in their short lifetimes. The three of them report the same phenomenon: Their friends who have no money have never come to them to ask them how they did it. But they do come asking for one of two things, or both: 1. a loan, or 2. a job.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我有几个朋友，他们在不长的时间里创造了数十亿美元的财富。他们中间有三位和我谈到过同样的现象：他们那些没钱的朋友从不去向他们请教是怎样赚到钱的。可是他们往往会去要求一种或两种东西：一是贷款，二是工作。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I would say that one of the hardest things about wealth building is to be true to yourself and be willing to not go along with the crowd. For in the market, it is usually the crowd that shows up late and is slaughtered. If a great deal is on the front page, it's too late in most instances. Look for a new deal. As we used to say as surfers: "There is always another wave." People who hurry and catch a wave late usually are the ones who wipe out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我想说，在积累财富的过程中，最困难的事情莫过于坚持自己的选择而不盲目从众。因为在竞争激烈的市场上，群体有时会意味着反映迟钝而被“宰割”。如果一项大交易被列在投资杂志的头一页，在多数情况下此刻去做这种交易恐怕为时已晚，这时，你应该去寻找新的机会了。就像我们通常所说的那样：“还会有另一拨”。人们总是匆匆忙忙去赶已经过去的那一拨时，往往又会被新的一拨淘汰出局。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I have had more close friends try to talk me out of a deal or an investment. A few years ago, a friend told me he was excited because he found a 6 percent certificate of deposit. I told him I earn 16 percent from the state government. The next day he sent me an article about why my investment was dangerous. I have received 16 percent for years now, and he still receives 6 percent.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我有许多亲密朋友试图劝说我不要去做某一项交易或投资。几年前，一位朋友告诉我，他非常高兴，因为他发现了一份利率为6％的大额存单。我告诉他我从州政府获得的投资回报是16％。第二天，他送给我一篇文章说明我的投资是危险的。而现在这么多年过去了，我一直获取每年16％的投资回报，而他却依然只能得到6％。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Smart investors don't time markets. If they miss a wave, they search for the next one and get themselves in position. Why this is hard for most investors is because buying what is not popular is frightening to them. Timid investors are like sheep going along with the crowd. Or their greed gets them in when wise investors have already taken their profits and moved on. Wise investors buy an investment when it's not popular. They know their profits are made when they buy, not when they sell. They wait patiently. As I said, they do not time the market. Just like a surfer, they get in position for the next big swell.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="精明的投资者不会抱怨市场时机不对，如果错过了这一拨，他们就会去寻找下一个机会，并且在其中找到自己的位置。对大多数投资者来说，做到这一点之所以非常困难，是因为一旦他们买人的东西不那么流行，他们就会感到害怕。胆小的投资者总是亦步亦趋地跟在众人后面，当欲望终于驱使他们冒险投资时，精明的投资者此刻已经获利退出了。明智的投资者往往购买一项不太流行的投资，他们懂得盈利是在购买时就已获得，而不是在出售时获得的，他们会耐心地等待时机实现投资增值。正如我所说，他们并不计较市场时机，就像一位冲浪者，他们时刻等待着下一个大浪来将他们高高托起。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It's all "insider trading." There are forms of insider trading that are illegal, and there are forms of insider trading that are legal. But either way, it's insider trading. The only distinction is how far away from the inside are you? The reason you want to have rich friends who are close to the inside is because that is where the money is made. It's made on information. You want to hear about the next boom, get in and get out before the next bust. I'm not saying do it illegally, but the sooner you know, the better your chances are for profits with minimal risk. That is what friends are for. And that is financial intelligence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到处都有“内部人交易”。有些形式的内部人交易是非法的，而有些形式的内部人交易是合法的。但不管怎样，它们都属于内部人交易。惟一的区别在于你离内幕到底有多近。 你可以有接近内幕的富裕朋友，因为钱就是由“内幕信息”挣来的，这样你就能在繁荣之前买进，并在危机之前卖出。我不是说非法地去做，但是，信息得到得越早，获利的机会就越大，风险就会越小，这就是朋友的作用。这也是一种财商。">查看中文翻译</div>
