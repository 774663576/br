<div class="line_en">There was no means of steering; the dragon could not see where it was going, and Harry knew that if it turned sharply or rolled in midair they would find it impossible to cling onto its broad back. Nevertheless, as they climbed higher and higher, London unfurling below them like a gray-and-green map, Harry's overwhelming feeling was of gratitude for an escape that had seemed impossible. Crouching low over the beast's neck, he clung tight to the metallic scales, and the cool breeze was soothing on his burned and blistered skin, the dragon's wings beating the air like the sails of a windmill. Behind him, whether from delight or fear he could not tell, Ron kept swearing at the top of his voice, and Hermione seemed to be sobbing.</div>

<div class="line_en">After five minutes or so, Harry lost some of his immediate dread that the dragon was going to throw them off, for it seemed intent on nothing but getting as far away from its underground prison as possible; but the question of how and when they were to dismount remained rather frightening. He had no idea how long dragons could fly without landing, nor how this particular dragon, which could barely see, would locate a good place to put down. He glanced around constantly, imagining that he could feel his scar prickling…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="过了大约五分钟，哈利不再那么担心巨龙会把他们扔下去了，它似乎一心只想远离地牢。但是怎样下去以及什么时候才能下去的问题仍然十分可怕。他不知道巨龙能持续飞行多久，也不知道这条半瞎的巨龙能不能找到一个好的地方着陆。他不停地扫视四周，隐约感觉到伤疤在刺痛……">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">How long would it be before Voldemort knew that they had broken into the Lestranges" vault? How soon would the goblins of Gringotts notify Bellatrix?

<div class="line_en">The dragon seemed to crave cooler and fresher air: It climbed steadily until they were flying through wisps of chilly cloud, and Harry could no longer make out the little colored dots which were cars pouring in and out of the capital. On and on they flew, over countryside parceled out in patches of green and brown, over roads and rivers winding through the landscape like strips of matte and glossy ribbon.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="巨龙似乎渴求更凉爽、更清新的空气。它不断向上升，直到飞行在一丝丝寒冷的轻云间，哈利再也看不清进出首都的汽车变成的彩色小点。他们不停地飞呀飞，飞过一片片绿色和棕色交织的乡间，地面上蜿蜒的公路与河流宛如一条条暗淡或光滑的丝带。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No idea," Harry bellowed back. His hands were numb with cold but he did not dare attempt to shift his grip. He had been wondering for some time what they would do if they saw the coast sail beneath them, if the dragon headed for open sea; he was cold and numb, not to mention desperately hungry and thirsty. When, he wondered, had the beast itself last eaten? Surely it would need sustenance before long? And what if, at that point, it realized it had three highly edible humans sitting on its back?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不知道。”哈利叫道。手冻得都麻木了，但是他紧抓着龙鳞不敢动一下。他已经担心了有一段时间，如果看到海岸线在下面飘移，如果巨龙朝着远海飞去，他们该怎么办？他浑身寒冷发木，更不用说极度饥渴。他不知道这巨龙上一次吃东西是在什么时候，它肯定要不多久就会需要食物了吧？如果到时候它意识到背上有三个相当可口的活人，又该怎么办？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The sun slipped lower in the sky, which was turning indigo; and still the dragon flew, cities and towns gliding out of sight beneath them, its enormous shadow sliding over the earth like a great dark cloud. Every part of Harry ached with the effort of holding on to the dragon's back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="太阳又滑下去一些，天空变成了靛蓝色。巨龙仍在飞行，它巨大的影子像一大块乌云掠过地面，城市和集镇在他们下方远去。由于一直死命抓着龙背，哈利感到浑身疼痛。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He slithered over the side of the dragon and plummeted feetfirst toward the surface of the lake; the drop was greater than he had estimated and he hit the water hard, plunging like a stone into a freezing, green, reed-filled world. He kicked toward the surface and emerged, panting, to see enormous ripples emanating in circles from the places where Ron and Hermione had fallen. The dragon did not seem to have noticed anything: It was already fifty feet away, swooping low over the lake to scoop up water in its scarred snout. As Ron and Hermione emerged, spluttering and gasping, from the depths of the lake, the dragon flew on, its wings beating hard, and landed at last on a distant bank.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他从巨龙的侧面滑了下去，脚朝下垂直地向着湖面坠落。落水的过程比他想象的猛烈，他重重地击中水面，像一块石头落进了一个冰冷的满是芦苇的绿色世界。他蹬腿游向湖面，浮了上来，喘着粗气，看到大圈的涟漪从罗恩和赫敏落水的地方扩散开来。巨龙似乎什么也没有注意到，它已经在五十英尺外，正俯冲到湖面上用伤疤累累的口鼻饮水。罗恩和赫敏从湖水深处浮了上来，吐着水，大口吸气。巨龙接着飞行，猛烈地拍打着翅膀，最后停在了远处的湖岸上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry, Ron, and Hermione struck out for the opposite shore. The lake did not seem to be deep: Soon it was more a question of fighting their way through reeds and mud than swimming, and at last they flopped, sodden, panting, and exhausted, onto slippery grass.</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry pulled the Horcrux from the pocket of the wet jacket he had just taken off and set it down on the grass in front of them. Glinting in the sun, it drew their eyes as they swigged their bottles of juice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利从他刚脱下的湿外衣口袋里掏出那个魂器，放在面前的草地上。它在阳光下闪闪发亮，正在痛饮南瓜汁的罗恩和赫敏被吸引住了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When he had finished, he joined the others. It was the first time that he had seen them properly since escaping from the vault. Both had angry red burns all over their faces and arms, and their clothing was singed away in places. They were wincing as they dabbed essence of dittany onto their many injuries. Hermione handed Harry the bottle, then pulled out three bottles of pumpkin juice she had brought from Shell Cottage and clean, dry robes for all of them. They changed and then gulped down the juice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="完成之后，他回到了两个同伴身边。这是逃出金库后他第一次细看他俩。罗恩和赫敏的脸上和手臂上到处都是红肿的烫伤，衣服多处被烧焦了。他们正在往数不清的伤处抹着白鲜香精，痛得直皱眉头。赫敏把药瓶递给哈利，又掏出她从贝壳小屋带来的三瓶南瓜汁和干净的袍子。三人换了衣服，开始大口喝着南瓜汁。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And Hogwarts… but he knew that his Horcrux there was safe; it would be impossible for Potter to enter Hogsmeade without detection, let alone the school. Nevertheless, it would be prudent to alert Snape to the fact that the boy might try to reenter the castle… To tell Snape why the boy might return would be foolish, of course; it had been a grave mistake to trust Bellatrix and Malfoy: Didn't their stupidity and carelessness prove how unwise it was ever to trust?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="还有霍格沃茨……但是他知道魂器在那里是安全的。波特进入霍格莫德都不可能不被察觉，更不用说学校了。不过，最好还是警告一下斯内普，说那男孩会设法潜入城堡……当然，告诉斯内普那男孩为什么会回去是犯傻。信任贝拉特里克斯和马尔福就是重大的失误，他们的愚蠢和大意不是证明了相信别人是多么不明智吗？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He would visit the Gaunt shack first, then, and take Nagini with him: He would not be parted from the snake anymore… and he strode from the room, through the hall, and out into the dark garden where the fountain played; he called the snake in Parseltongue and it slithered out to join him like a long shadow…</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry's eyes flew open as he wrenched himself back to the present: He was lying on the bank of the lake in the setting sun, and Ron and Hermione were looking down at him. Judging by their worried looks, and by the continued pounding of his scar, his sudden excursion into Voldemort's mind had not passed unnoticed. He struggled up, shivering, vaguely surprised that he was still wet to his skin, and saw the cup lying innocently in the grass before him, and the lake, deep blue shot with gold in the failing sun.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利突然睁开眼睛，把自己猛拉回当前的现实中。他躺在夕阳下的湖岸上，罗恩和赫敏在低头看着他。从他们焦急的表情和伤疤连续的剧痛判断，他们已经注意到他刚才突然闯入了伏地魔的思想。哈利战栗着挣扎起来，发现身上仍然透湿，略微有些惊讶。小金杯看似毫无危险地放在他面前的草丛里，深蓝色的湖面在落日的余晖中金光闪闪。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The flapping of enormous wings echoed across the black water: The dragon had drunk its fill and risen into the air. They paused in their preparations to watch it climb higher and higher, now black against the rapidly darkening sky, until it vanished over a nearby mountain. Then Hermione walked forward and took her place between the other two. Harry pulled the Cloak down as far as it would go, and together they turned on the spot into the crushing darkness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="巨大翅膀的拍打声在黑色的湖面上回响：火龙已经喝足了水，飞入空中。他们暂时停止了准备工作，看着它越飞越高，黑色的身影映在迅速暗下来的天空中，直到消失在不远处的山峰后。然后，赫敏走过来站在他俩中间，哈利把隐形衣尽量往下拉了拉。他们一同原地旋转，进入了压迫身心的黑暗中。">查看中文翻译</div>
