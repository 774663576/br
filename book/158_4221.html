<div class="line_en">At the dessert the women themselves made some delicate and discreet allusions. Their eyes glistened; they had drunk much. The Count, who preserved, even in his flights, his grand appearance of gravity, made a comparison, much relished, upon the subject of those wintering at the pole, and the joy of ship-wrecked sailors who saw an opening toward the south.</div>

<div class="line_en">Loiseau suddenly arose, a glass of champagne in his hand, and said:"I drink to our deliverance. "Everybody was on his feet; they shouted in agreement. Even the two good sisters consented to touch their lips to the froth of the wine which they had never before tasted. They declared that it tasted like charged lemonade, only much nicer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="鸟老板兴高采烈，手里举着一杯香槟站起来：“我为了我们获得解放饮一杯！”全体都站起了，都向他喝采了。那两个嬷嬷因为几个贵妇人的央求，都答应把嘴唇放在这种从来没有试过的腾着泡沫的酒里沾一下。她们高声说这酒很像柠檬汽水，然而它的味道究竟比汽水好得多。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Loiseau resumed:"It is unfortunate that we have no piano, for we might make up a quadrille."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="鸟老板简单地提出了应景的意见。“这儿没有钢琴真不痛快，否则可以弹一首四人对舞的曲子。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Cornudet had not said a word, nor made a gesture; he appeared plunged in very grave thoughts, and made sometimes a furious motion, so that his great beard seemed to wish to free itself. Finally, toward midnight, as they were separating, Loiseau, who was staggering, touched him suddenly on the stomach and said to him in a stammer:"You are not very funny, this evening; you have said nothing, citizen!"Then Cornudet raised his head brusquely and, casting a brilliant, terrible glance around the company, said:" I tell you all that you have been guilty of infamy!"He rose, went to the door, and again repeated:"Infamy, I say!"and disappeared.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="戈尔弩兑一直没有说一句话，没有做一个手势，并且像是沉没在一些很严肃的思想里，偶尔用一个气忿得很的动作捋着自己的长胡子如同想再拉长一点似的。末了，在12点光景人都快要分手的时候，鸟老板正晃着身子摇摇摆摆，忽然拍着戈尔弩兑的肚子一面结结巴巴向他说：“您并不开开玩笑，今天晚上，您什么也不说吗，公民？”但是戈尔弩兑突然抬起了脑袋，用一阵亮得怕人的眼光向全体扫视了一周，他说：“我说你们各位刚才都做了一件很可耻的事！”他说完站起来，走到了门口又说一遍，“一件很可耻的事！”末了他走了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This made a coldness at first. Loiseau, interlocutor, was stupefied; but he recovered immediately and laughed heartily as he said:"He is very green, my friends. He is very green. "And then, as they did not comprehend, he told them about the"mysteries of the corridor. "Then there was a return of gaiety. The women behaved like lunatics. The Count and Mr. Carré-Lamadon wept from the force of their laughter. They could not believe it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="开初，这像是对他们泼了一头的凉水，鸟老板吃了一惊呆呆地待着，不过随后他恢复了稳定态度，突然弯着身子笑起来一面重复地说：“他们都太大意了，老朋友，他们都太大意了。”这时候，人们都不懂得他的意思，于是他叙述了“过道里的秘密”。这样使大家重新哄堂地大笑了一阵。那些贵妇人快活得如同痴婆子似的。伯爵和迦来－辣马东先生连眼泪都笑出来。他们简直不能相信这样一件事。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They separated.

"You know," she continued,"how some women will take to a uniform, whether it be French or Prussian! It is all the same to them! Oh! what a pity!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大家就是这样分手了。不过鸟夫人的格性是和荨麻样的，到了两夫妇刚刚躺下去的时候，她向丈夫指出了迦来－辣马东家那个娇小的坏东西在整个晚上一直假笑：“你得知道，娘儿们到了心爱着军人时候，不管那是法国人或者普鲁士人，在她们看来全是一样的。这是不是一种怜悯的意思，我主上帝！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The next day a clear winter's sun made the snow very brilliant. The diligence, already harnessed, waited before the door, while an army of white pigeons, in their thick plumage, with rose-colored eyes, with a black spot in the center, walked up and down gravely among the legs of the six horses, seeking their livelihood in the manure there scattered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第六天，冬天的明亮太阳把积雪照成教人目眩的了。那辆终于套好了的长途马车在旅馆门外等着，一大群白的鸽子从它们的厚而密的羽毛里伸着脑袋，亮出它们那种瞳孔乌黑的玫瑰色眼睛，稳重地在六匹牲口的脚底下散步，向着牲口撒下的热气腾腾的粪里边寻觅它们的营养物。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And all night, in the darkness of the corridor, there were to be heard light noises, like whisperings and walking in bare feet, and imperceptible creakings. They did not go to sleep until late, that is sure, for there were threads of light shining under the doors for a long time. The champagne had its effect; they say it troubles sleep.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="整整的一夜，在过道的黑暗中间，如同战栗似地传出一阵阵的轻微声息，那是仅仅教人察觉得到的，像是一阵阵的呼吸声，一阵阵赤脚的触地声，一阵阵无从捉摸的摩擦声。人都显然是睡得很迟的，因为有好些光线从各处屋子门底下的缝儿里长久地漏到了外面。香槟酒真有它的效力，据人说，它是扰乱瞌睡的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The driver, enveloped in his sheepskin, had a lighted pipe under the seat, and all the travelers, radiant, were rapidly packing some provisions for the rest of the journey. They were only waiting for Ball-of-Fat. Finally she appeared.</div>

<div class="line_en">The fat girl stopped, half stupefied; then, plucking up courage, she approached the manufacturer's wife with"Good morning, Madame,"humbly murmured. The lady made a slight bow of the head which she accompanied with a look of outraged virtue. Everybody seemed busy, and kept themselves as far from her as if she had had some infectious disease in her skirts. Then they hurried into the carriage, where she came last, alone, and where she took the place she had occupied during the first part of the journey.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="胖“姑娘”觉得心下茫然，停着不前进了，随后集中了全部勇气，她才卑屈地轻轻道出一声“早安，夫人”，走到厂长夫人的近边，那一个只用头部表示一个倨傲的招呼，同时还用一种失面子的人的眼光望着。大家都像是忙碌的，而且离开她远远站着，仿佛她的裙子里带来了一种肮脏。随后人都赶到了车子跟前，她单独地到得最后，静悄悄地重新坐上了她在第一天路上坐过的那个位子。">查看中文翻译</div>
