<div class="line_en">Bethany had been prepared by the nurses, she was dressed to go out. Cross could see she was a blurry reflection of her mother, and tall for her age. There was still the blankness in her face and eyes, and her body was too slack. Her features did not seem to have real definition, as if partially dissolved, like a bar of used soap. She still wore the red plastic apron that she used to protect her clothes when she was painting. She had been painting on the wall since early that morning. She didn't acknowledge seeing them, and she received her mother's hug and kisses with a shrinking away of her body and face.</div>

<div class="line_en">Athena parked the car a few yards from a dazzling lake nestled in the forest, a tiny blue gem in a vast cloth of green. Cross took the basket of food, and Athena unpacked it onto a red cloth she spread over the grass. She also put out crisp green napkins and forks and spoons. The cloth was embroidered with musical instruments that caught Bethany's attention. Then Athena spread out a pile of different sandwiches, glass bowls of potato salad, and sliced fruits. Then a plate of sweet cakes oozing cream. And a platter of fried chicken. She had prepared everything with the care of a catering professional because Bethany loved food.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="安提娜把车停在离湖几码远的树林里。湖面闪耀着粼粼波光，好似一大块绿色布料中间的一小粒蓝宝石。克罗斯把午餐篮拎到野餐的地点，安提娜在草地上铺开一块红色的桌布，把午餐篮里的食物一一放在桌布上。她把崭新的绿色餐巾和餐具也取了出来。桌布上绣着的各种乐器吸引了贝萨妮的注意。接着，安提娜排开一大堆不同种类的三明治，几份用玻璃碗装的土豆沙拉和水果薄片。然后是一碟香甜的奶油蛋糕和一盘炸鸡。她好似一个想要迎合客户口味的大厨，精心准备好这一切，因为贝萨妮喜爱食物。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Cross went back to the car and took a case of soda from the trunk. There were glasses in the basket and he poured soda for them. Athena offered her glass to Bethany, but Bethany struck her hand aside. She was watching Cross.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克罗斯从车后备厢拿出一箱汽水。午餐篮里有玻璃杯，他为他们斟满饮料。安提娜把她的杯子递给贝萨妮，但贝萨妮却拍开她的手，然后看着克罗斯。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They ate, and Athena took on the role of the insensitive chatterbox, trying to make Bethany laugh. Cross marveled at how skillful she was, affectedly irritating and boring, as if the autistic behavior of her child was perfectly natural, treating Bethany as a fellow gossip though the girl never answered. It was an inspired monologue she created to ease her own pain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="野餐的时候，安提娜不停说话，极力想把贝萨妮逗笑。克罗斯惊异于她的娴熟，假装的愤怒和无聊，好像她孩子的自闭症行为完全理所当然，她把贝萨妮当作闲聊的对象，但是贝萨妮却从不应声。这是一出感人的独角戏，她自导自演，为了消减自己的痛楚。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Cross stared into her eyes. Her face was so rigid it could have been a mask instead of flesh, but her eyes were now alert. It was as if she was trapped in some secret cave, that she was being smothered but could not call for help, that her flesh was blistered and she could not bear to be touched.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克罗斯望着她的眼睛。她板着的脸像是一张面具，但她的眼神警惕起来。就仿佛她跌入某个隐秘的洞穴里，仿佛快要窒息却无法呼救，仿佛浑身起了水泡因而谁也碰不得。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Finally it was time for dessert. Athena unwrapped one of the creamy cakes and offered it to Bethany, who refused it. She offered one to Cross and he shook his head. He was getting very nervous because, though Bethany had consumed an enormous amount of food, it was obvious she was very angry with her mother. He knew that Athena sensed it, too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后是甜点时间，安提娜取出一块奶油蛋糕，端给贝萨妮，贝萨妮不要。她给克罗斯也取了一块，克罗斯摇摇头。他现在很紧张，因为虽然贝萨妮吃得不少，但显然她很生妈妈的气。他知道，安提娜一定也感觉到了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Athena ate the pastry and exclaimed enthusiastically about how delicious it was. She unwrapped another two and set them before Bethany. The girl usually loved sweets. Bethany took them off the tablecloth and put them on the grass. In a few minutes they were covered with insects. Then Bethany picked up the two cakes and shoved one into her mouth. She handed the other to Cross. Without a moment's hesitation, Cross put the pastry into his mouth. There was a tickling sensation all across his palate and on the sides of his gums. He quickly gulped some soda to wash it down. Bethany looked at Athena.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="安提娜咬了一口蛋糕，兴高采烈地呼喊这东西如何美味。又取出两块放在贝萨妮面前，这女孩喜欢甜食。贝萨妮把它们拿出桌布放到草地上。仅仅几分钟，点心上就爬满了虫子。然后贝萨妮把这两块糕点取回来，往自己嘴里放了一块，把另一块递给克罗斯。克罗斯毫不犹豫地把蛋糕塞进嘴里。他感觉整个上颚和牙龈两侧有点痒痒的，连忙猛灌了几口汽水，好把这些虫子冲进肚子里。然后贝萨妮看向安提娜。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On the drive back to the hospital, she spoke to Cross with some of the same inflections she used with Bethany. As if he, too, were autistic. Bethany watched her carefully and then turned to stare at Cross.</div>

<div class="line_en">Athena had the studied frown of an actress planning to do a difficult scene. Then she laughed, a wonderfully infectious laugh, and clapped her hands. "I told you it was delicious," she said. She unwrapped another pastry, but Bethany refused and so did Cross. Athena threw the pastry onto the grass and then took her napkin and wiped Bethany's mouth and then did the same to Cross. She was enjoying herself, it seemed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="安提娜若有所思地皱起了眉头，好像一个女演员，正面对一场很难表演的戏。很快，她笑了起来，笑得很有感染力，拍着手说道：“很好吃吧。”她再取出一块蛋糕，但贝萨妮和克罗斯都不要。安提娜随手把点心一丢，用餐巾帮贝萨妮擦了嘴，然后也给克罗斯擦了擦，看上去自得其乐。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She said to him fondly, "You've had a terrible day and you shall have your reward." There was a mocking tone to her voice, but he understood it was a mockery of her own beauty, she knew her magic was false.</div>

<div class="line_en">Now she looked sad. Cross wondered how he loved her most, when she was naturally exuberant, when she was stern and serious, or when she was melancholy. Her face changed so magically in its beauty that he always found his feelings matching hers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在她终于露出难受的样子了，克罗斯想知道他什么时候最爱她，是当她生气勃勃的时候，当她严肃认真的时候，还是她闷闷不乐的时候。她美丽的面容不断变化，似乎有种魔力，克罗斯自己的情绪也随她一起变化。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For Cross, he was a child again waking up with a day of pleasure before him, the breakfast his mother prepared, the playing of games with his friends, the hunting trips with his father, then supper with his family, Claudia, Nalene, and Pippi. The card games afterward. It was that innocent a feeling. Before him was making love to Athena in the twilight, watching the sun disappear over the Pacific from the balcony, the sky painted with marvelous reds and pinks, the touch of her warm flesh and silky skin. Her beautiful face and lips to kiss. He smiled and led her up the stairs.</div>

More than anything else he was desperate for the hours of making love to Athena.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“一个亲戚。”克罗斯说，他对自己的所作所为感到震惊，而这样做的原因竟然是他不想放弃和安提娜度过一晚。这是重罪。他还想知道，乔治是怎么知道他在这儿，他有什么事。肯定有要紧的事，他觉得，但是不管什么事都能等明早再说。没什么事比和安提娜做几个小时爱更让他心驰神往的了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When Cross made love to her, it seemed that all the cells of his brain and body flew out and he was left in some feverish dream; he was a ghost whose wisps were filled with ecstasy, a ghost who entered her flesh. He lost all his caution, all his reason, he didn't even study her face to see if she was acting, if she truly loved him. It seemed to go on forever, until they fell asleep in each other's arms.

Marlowe had been killed while fleeing the scene by Detective Jim Losey, who had been trailing Marlowe in a drug case. Marlowe had a gun in his hand and pointed it at Losey who had therefore shot him down, a clean shot through the bridge of his nose. When Losey investigated, he discovered Pippi De Lena, and immediately called Dante Clericuzio. Before he notified even the police. Why would he do so even if he was on the Family payroll? A great irony -- Pippi De Lena, the ultimate Qualified Man, the Clericuzio Number One Hammer for over thirty years, murdered by a raggedy drug-dealing mugger.</div>

<div class="line_en">But now Cross on his balcony overlooking Vegas pondered the central issue. The Don never believed in coincidence and yet here was a case bursting with coincidence. Detective Jim Losey was on the Family payroll and out of the thousands of detectives and policemen in Los Angeles, it was he who stumbled on the killing. What were the odds on that? But put that aside. Even more important, Don Domenico Clericuzio well knew it was impossible for a street mugger to get that close to Pippi De Lena. And what mugger fired six shots before fleeing?

<div class="line_en">But then why had the Don sent Vincent and Petie to transport him with an armored car and guarded him until the funeral? Why had the Don taken such elaborate precautions?

That he had made a full investigation and it seemed all the facts were true. A petty thief had made a mistake and a foolish tragedy had ensued, but then, the Don said, most tragedies were foolish.</div>
