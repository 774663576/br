The old dry wood and countless layers of paint and varnish blazed with a fierce hungry light. Heat rose shimmering through the chill air; behind, the gargoyles and stone dragons on the castle walls seemed blurred, as if Davos were seeing them through a veil of tears.

<div class="line_en">The red woman walked round the fire three times, praying once in the speech of Asshai, once in High Valyrian, and once in the Common Tongue. Davos understood only the last. "R'hllor, come to us in our darkness," she called. "Lord of Light, we offer you these false gods, these seven who are one, and him the enemy. Take them and cast your light upon us, for the night is dark and full of terrors." Queen Selyse echoed the words. Beside her, Stannis watched impassively, his jaw hard as stone under the blue-black shadow of his tight-cropped beard. He had dressed more richly than was his wont, as if for the sept.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="红袍女环行火堆三次，一次以亚夏语祈祷，一次使用高等瓦雷利亚语，最后一次则用普通话。戴佛斯只能听懂末一次。“拉赫洛啊！吾人身处黑暗之中，请降临于此！”她高喊，“真主光之王，我们将这些虚伪诸神奉献于您，这些七面一体的诸神，是您的仇敌。请取走他们，将您的光明赐予我们，因为长夜黑暗，处处险恶。”赛丽丝王后跟着复诵祷文。史坦尼斯站在她身旁，面无表情地观看。他的胡子修得极短，黑蓝色阴影下是坚硬如石的下巴。他的衣着较平时华丽，彷佛准备上圣堂膜拜。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dragonstone's sept had been where Aegon the Conqueror knelt to pray the night before he sailed. That had not saved it from the queen's men. They had overturned the altars, pulled down the statues, and smashed the stained glass with warhammers. Septon Barre could only curse them, but Ser Hubard Rambton led his three sons to the sept to defend their gods. The Rambtons had slain four of the queen's men before the others overwhelmed them. Afterward Guncer Sunglass, mildest and most pious of lords, told Stannis he could no longer support his claim. Now he shared a sweltering cell with the septon and Ser Hubard's two surviving sons. The other lords had not been slow to take the lesson.</div>

<div class="line_en">Maester Cressen would have stopped this. The old man had challenged the Lord of Light and been struck down for his impiety, or so the gossips told each other. Davos knew the truth. He had seen the maester slip something into the wine cup. Poison. What else could it be? He drank a cup of death to free Stannis from Melisandre, but somehow her god shielded her. He would gladly have killed the red woman for that, yet what chance would he have where a maester of the Citadel had failed? He was only a smuggler raised high, Davos of Flea Bottom, the Onion Knight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果克礼森师傅健在，一定会阻止此事。谣传老人公然挑战光之王，结果因亵渎而遭天谴。然而戴佛斯知道真相，因为他亲眼见到老学士往酒杯里放了东西。一定是毒药，除此之外别无可能。他自愿喝下死亡毒酒，想为史坦尼斯除掉梅丽珊卓，但不知为何，她的神显灵庇佑。为此，他本想动手杀了红袍女，可连出身学城的学士都力有未逮，他又怎么可能成功？他不过是出身跳蚤窝的走私者戴佛斯，被拔擢至高位的洋葱骑士啊。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The burning gods cast a pretty light, wreathed in their robes of shifting flame, red and orange and yellow. Septon Barre had once told Davos how they'd been carved from the masts of the ships that had carried the first Targaryens from Valyria. Over the centuries, they had been painted and repainted, gilded, silvered, jeweled. "Their beauty will make them more pleasing to R'hllor," Melisandre said when she told Stannis to pull them down and drag them out the castle gates.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="燃烧中的诸神彷佛穿着颜色多变的烈焰长袍，由红转橙再变黄，放射出漂亮的光芒。巴尔修士曾对戴佛斯说，神像都是用船桅雕刻而成，而这些船乃是坦格利安一族的先祖从瓦雷利亚渡海逃来时搭乘的工具。几世纪来，它们被涂上层层彩漆、镀金、烫银、镶嵌珠宝。“它们越是美丽，便越能讨拉赫洛欢心。”梅丽珊卓嘱咐史坦尼斯拉倒神像，并将之拖到城堡大门时，曾这么说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The gods had never meant much to Davos the smuggler, though like most men he had been known to make offerings to the Warrior before battle, to the Smith when he launched a ship, and to the Mother whenever his wife grew great with child. He felt ill as he watched them burn, and not only from the smoke.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="并不只是浓烟的缘故对走私者戴佛斯而言，诸神没有特别意义，但他和多数人一样，每次出征前总会供奉战士；有船下水会敬拜铁匠；妻子有了身孕，则会向圣母祈祷。眼见诸神被焚，他觉得很不舒服，这并不只是浓烟的缘故。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Maiden lay athwart the Warrior, her arms widespread as if to embrace him. The Mother seemed almost to shudder as the flames came licking up her face. A longsword had been thrust through her heart, and its leather grip was alive with flame. The Father was on the bottom, the first to fall. Davos watched the hand of the Stranger writhe and curl as the fingers blackened and fell away one by one, reduced to so much glowing charcoal. Nearby, Lord Celtigar coughed fitfully and covered his wrinkled face with a square of linen embroidered in red crabs. The Myrmen swapped jokes as they enjoyed the warmth of the fire, but young Lord Bar Emmon had turned a splotchy grey, and Lord Velaryon was watching the king rather than the conflagration.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="少女张开双臂，横躺于战士之上，彷佛是和他拥抱。烈焰舔舐着圣母的面颊，她彷佛为之颤抖，一把长剑将她穿心而过，皮革握把上火焰跃动。天父头一个被推倒，所以压在最底层。戴佛斯看着陌客的手指纠结缠绕，逐渐焦黑，终至剥落，成了亮红的炭火。赛提加伯爵离火堆较近，正剧烈咳嗽，拿着一条绣有红蟹的亚麻方巾，遮掩布满皱纹的脸庞；密尔人一边在火边取暖，一边谈笑风生；年轻的巴尔艾蒙伯爵却是面如死灰；瓦列利安伯爵则是眼看国王，不瞧那堆熊熊烈焰。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Davos would have given much to know what he was thinking, but one such as Velaryon would never confide in him. The Lord of the Tides was of the blood of ancient Valyria, and his House had thrice provided brides for Targaryen princes; Davos Seaworth stank of fish and onions. It was the same with the other lordlings. He could trust none of them, nor would they ever include him in their private councils. They scorned his sons as well. My grandsons will joust with theirs, though, and one day their blood may wed with mine. In time my little black ship will fly as high as Velaryon's seahorse or Celtigar's red crabs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="戴佛斯很想知道他心里在盘算什么。但瓦列利安这样身份地位的人，怎么会对他吐露心声？瓦列利安家族别号“潮汐之王”，身负古老瓦雷利亚血统，并曾三度与坦格利安家结亲，而戴佛斯·席渥斯呢？浑身都是鱼腥和洋葱味。其他贵族对他也是一样态度，他无法信任他们，他们也绝不会与他推心置腹，甚至连他的孩子都瞧不起。将来我的孙子们会在比武大会上与他们的后代相互较劲，有朝一日，说不定他们的后代会和我的子孙结亲。总有一天，我的小黑船旗会如瓦列利安家的海马旗或赛提加家的红蟹旗一般高高飘扬…">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Everything I am, I owe to him. Stannis had raised him to knighthood. He had given him a place of honor at his table, a war galley to sail in place of a smuggler's skiff. Dale and Allard captained galleys as well, Maric was oarmaster on the Fury, Matthos served his father on Black Betha, and the king had taken Devan as a royal squire. One day he would be knighted, and the two little lads as well. Marya was mistress of a small keep on Cape Wrath, with servants who called her m'lady, and Davos could hunt red deer in his own woods. All this he had of Stannis Baratheon, for the price of a few finger joints. It was just, what he did to me. I had flouted the king's laws all my life. He has earned my loyalty. Davos touched the little pouch that hung from the leather thong about his neck. His fingers were his luck, and he needed luck now. As do we all. Lord Stannis most of all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我所拥有的一切，都是他赐予的。史坦尼封他为骑士，让他与其他贵族并肩而坐，令他放弃走私小艇、指挥战船。到如今，戴尔和阿拉德也已各有船舰，马利克当上了“怒火号”的桨官，马索斯在“黑贝莎号”上为父亲效力，国王更将戴冯收作王家侍从，有朝一日定能受封骑士，他的两个小儿子将来也会走上同样的道路。妻子玛瑞亚成了位于风怒角的小城堡的女主人，仆人都得称她为“夫人”，戴佛斯还可以在属于自己的森林里猎红鹿。这些全拜史坦尼斯·拜拉席恩所赐，他付出的代价仅是几个指节。他对我的惩罚很公正，我过去一向蔑视王法，而他却赢得了我的忠诚。戴佛斯摸摸悬挂颈间的小皮袋，被砍下的指节是他的幸运符，而他眼下正需要好运。是啊，我们每个人都需要好运，尤其是史坦尼斯大人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Stannis Baratheon strode forward like a soldier marching into battle. His squires stepped up to attend him. Davos watched as his son Devan pulled a long padded glove over the king's right hand. The boy wore a cream-colored doublet with a fiery heart sewn on the breast. Bryen Farring was similarly garbed as he tied a stiff leather cape around His Grace's neck. Behind, Davos heard a faint clank and clatter of bells. "Under the sea, smoke rises in bubbles, and flames burn green and blue and black," Patchface sang somewhere. "I know, I know, oh, oh, oh."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="史坦尼斯·拜拉席恩像士兵上战场一样大步前进，他的两位侍从连忙跟随。戴佛斯看着儿子戴冯为国王右手戴上一只又长又厚的手套。男孩穿着乳白色上衣，胸前绣了一颗烈焰红心。拜兰·法林的衣着与之相仿，他为陛下在颈间围上一袭僵硬的皮革斗篷。戴佛斯听见身后隐约传来铃声叮当。“海底下，冒烟就是冒泡泡，火有绿有蓝还有黑！”补丁脸的歌声从远方传来，“我知道！我知道！噢噢噢！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Melisandre was robed all in scarlet satin and blood velvet, her eyes as red as the great ruby that glistened at her throat as if it too were afire. "In ancient books of Asshai it is written that there will come a day after a long summer when the stars bleed and the cold breath of darkness falls heavy on the world. In this dread hour a warrior shall draw from the fire a burning sword. And that sword shall be Lightbringer, the Red Sword of Heroes, and he who clasps it shall be Azor Ahai come again, and the darkness shall flee before him." She lifted her voice, so it carried out over the gathered host. "Azor Ahai, beloved of R'hllor! The Warrior of Light, the Son of Fire! Come forth, your sword awaits you!

<div class="line_en">The port was as crowded as Davos had ever known it. Every dock teemed with sailors loading provisions, and every inn was packed with soldiers dicing or drinking or looking for a whore… a vain search, since Stannis permitted none on his island. Ships lined the strand; war galleys and fishing vessels, stout carracks and fat-bottomed cogs. The best berths had been taken by the largest vessels: Stannis's flagship Fury rocking between Lord Steffon and Stag of the Sea, Lord Velaryon's silver-hulled Pride of Driftmark and her three sisters, Lord Celtigar's ornate Red Claw, the ponderous Swordfish with her long iron prow.

<div class="line_en">Across the noisy common room, Salladhor Saan sat eating grapes from a wooden bowl. When he spied Davos, he beckoned him closer. "Ser knight, come sit with me. Eat a grape. Eat two. They are marvelously sweet." The Lyseni was a sleek, smiling man whose flamboyance was a byword on both sides of the narrow sea. Today he wore flashing cloth-of-silver, with dagged sleeves so long the ends of them pooled on the floor. His buttons were carved jade monkeys, and atop his wispy white curls perched a jaunty green cap decorated with a fan of peacock feathers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="众声喧哗的厅堂尽头，萨拉多·桑恩坐着吃盛在木碗里的葡萄。他一见到戴佛斯，便挥手示意对方过去。“骑士先生，来跟我坐坐，吃几颗葡萄如何？甜得很哟。”这名里斯人向来油嘴滑舌，笑容满面，他的服饰更是夸张特异，闻名狭海两岸。今天他穿着银线织成的亮丽外衣，悬袖子长得拖地，钮扣则用翡翠雕成猴子形状。在他一头纤细亮白的卷发上，戴了顶扇形的漂亮绿帽，上面饰着孔雀羽毛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Davos threaded his way through the tables to a chair. In the days before his knighthood, he had often bought cargoes from Salladhor Saan. The Lyseni was a smuggler himself, as well as a trader, a banker, a notorious pirate, and the self-styled Prince of the Narrow Sea. When a pirate grows rich enough, they make him a prince. It had been Davos who had made the journey to Lys to recruit the old rogue to Lord Stannis's cause.</div>

<div class="line_en">"The red priests have a great temple on Lys. Always they are burning this and burning that, crying out to their R'hllor. They bore me with their fires. Soon they will bore King Stannis too, it is to be hoped." He seemed utterly unconcerned that someone might overhear him, eating his grapes and dribbling the seeds out onto his lip, flicking them off with a finger. "My Bird of Thousand Colors came in yesterday, good ser. She is not a warship, no, but a trader, and she paid a call on King's Landing. Are you sure you will not have a grape?

<div class="line_en">A true sword of fire, now, that would be a wonder to behold. Yet at such a cost… When he thought of Nissa Nissa, it was his own Marya he pictured, a good-natured plump woman with sagging breasts and a kindly smile, the best woman in the world. He tried to picture himself driving a sword through her, and shuddered. I am not made of the stuff of heroes, he decided. If that was the price of a magic sword, it was more than he cared to pay.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="若今天这把是真的火焰剑，可称得上足以倚赖的奇物了，但付出的代价未免也太…他想到妮莎·妮莎，脑中浮现的却是妻子玛瑞亚。她是个好心肠的女人，有些胖，乳房下垂，笑容和蔼，是全世界最好的女人。他试图想像自己把宝剑刺进她心口的画面，不禁浑身颤抖。我果然不是做英雄的料啊，他下了结论。倘若欲得魔剑必须付出如此高昂的代价，那他可办不到。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ser Davos Seaworth lingered over his tankard for a good while, thinking. A year ago, he had been with Stannis in King's Landing when King Robert staged a tourney for Prince Joffrey's name day. He remembered the red priest Thoros of Myr, and the flaming sword he had wielded in the melee. The man had made for a colorful spectacle, his red robes flapping while his blade writhed with pale green flames, but everyone knew there was no true magic to it, and in the end his fire had guttered out and Bronze Yohn Royce had brained him with a common mace.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="戴佛斯·席渥斯爵士在酒馆里继续坐了一会儿，一边喝酒，一边想起了一年前的往事。当时他和史坦尼斯都在君临，劳勃国王为庆祝乔佛里王子的命名日，特别举办了一场比武大会。他记得密尔的红袍僧索罗斯在团体比武时，便是挥舞着一把冒火的剑。那人的装束可真是五彩缤纷，红袍在风中抖动，手中长剑则缠绕着淡绿的火焰，但每个人都清楚那并非魔法所致。最后他的火焰果真熄灭，而他也被青铜约恩·罗伊斯手中的钉头锤敲中头颅，摔下马背。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was good to see Devan looking so splendid in his squire's raiment, but the summons made Davos uneasy. Will he bid us sail? he wondered. Salladhor Saan was not the only captain who felt that King's Landing was ripe for an attack, but a smuggler must learn patience. We have no hope of victory. I said as much to Maester Cressen, the day I returned to Dragonstone, and nothing has changed. We are too few, the foes too many. If we dip our oars, we die. Nonetheless, he climbed onto the horse.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽然看到戴冯一身漂亮的侍从装束很令他欢喜，但对这个召唤本身，戴佛斯却颇感不安。莫非他要下令出航？他暗忖。其实除了萨拉多·桑恩，还有很多船长认为时机已然成熟，应该立刻出兵攻打君临，但做走私者的首先必须具备耐心。回龙石岛的当天我便对克礼森师傅说过，我们胜利无望，而情况至今毫无改变，我们兵力太少，而敌人则太多，一旦划桨入水，便必死无疑。唉，不管怎样，还是上马去了再说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Queen Selyse's uncle was a keg of a man with thick arms and bandy legs. He had the prominent ears of a Florent, even larger than his niece's. The coarse hair that sprouted from his ears did not stop him hearing most of what went on in the castle. For ten years Ser Axell had served as castellan of Dragonstone while Stannis sat on Robert's council in King's Landing, but of late he had emerged as the foremost of the queen's men. "Ser Davos, it is good to see you, as ever," he said.</div>

One hundred seventeen ravens will carry one hundred seventeen copies of my letter to every corner of the realm, from the Arbor to the Wall. Perhaps a hundred will win through against storm and hawk and arrow. If so, a hundred maesters will read my words to as many lords in as many solars and bedchambers… and then the letters will like as not be consigned to the fire, and lips pledged to silence.

If you run short of letters, capture a few septons and set them to copying out more. I mean to use your second son as well.

<div class="line_en">Stannis stood abruptly. "R'hllor. Why is that so hard? They will not love me, you say? When have they ever loved me? How can I lose something I have never owned?" He moved to the south window to gaze out at the moonlit sea. "I stopped believing in gods the day I saw the Windproud break up across the bay. Any gods so monstrous as to drown my mother and father would never have my worship, I vowed. In King's Landing, the High Septon would prattle at me of how all justice and goodness flowed from the Seven, but all I ever saw of either was made by men."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="史坦尼斯倏地起身，“‘拉赫洛’念起来有这么难？百姓不会爱戴我？你倒是说说看，他们什么时候爱过我了？既然如此，他们爱不爱我又有什么差别？”他走到面南的窗户，远眺月夜里的海洋。“从我亲眼目睹‘傲风号’触礁沉没的那天起，我便不再信神。我指天发誓，绝不敬拜任何淹死我双亲的残酷神只。在君临时，总主教成天对我唠叨世间一切公理正义均来自于七神，但我见到的种种‘公理正义’，却都是人力所为。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I trusted in his wisdom and your wiles, and what did they avail me, smuggler? The storm lords sent you packing. I went to them a beggar and they laughed at me. Well, there will be no more begging, and no more laughing either. The Iron Throne is mine by rights, but how am I to take it? There are four kings in the realm, and three of them have more men and more gold than I do. I have ships… and I have her. The red woman. Half my knights are afraid even to say her name, did you know? If she can do nothing else, a sorceress who can inspire such dread in grown men is not to be despised. A frightened man is a beaten man. And perhaps she can do more. I mean to find out.</div>

<div class="line_en">"When I was a lad I found an injured goshawk and nursed her back to health. Proudwing, I named her. She would perch on my shoulder and flutter from room to room after me and take food from my hand, but she would not soar. Time and again I would take her hawking, but she never flew higher than the treetops. Robert called her Weakwing. He owned a gyrfalcon named Thunderclap who never missed her strike. One day our great-uncle Ser Harbert told me to try a different bird. I was making a fool of myself with Proudwing, he said, and he was right." Stannis Baratheon turned away from the window, and the ghosts who moved upon the southern sea. "The Seven have never brought me so much as a sparrow. It is time I tried another hawk, Davos. A red hawk."</div>
