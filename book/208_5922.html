<div class="line_en">It is a truth well known to all the world that an unmarried man in possession of a large fortune must be in need of a wife. And when such a man moves into a neighbourhood, even if nothing is known about his feelings or opinions, this truth is so clear to the surrounding families, that they think of him immediately as the future husband of one or other of their daughters.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我真是不明白为什么要去拜访他，”班纳特先生说，“你可以和姑娘们去，或者你让她们自己去。对，还是让她们自己去好，你长得那么迷人，比她们哪个都不逊色，说不定彬格莱先生会看上你呢。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"My dear, you flatter me," replied his wife, "I certainly have been called beautiful in the past, but I think a woman with five adult daughters should stop thinking of her own beauty.

I simply cannot take the girls to see him unless you have already met him."</div>

During the long years of their marriage, he had had time to regret his mistake.

His experience had made him rather bitter, and he could not stop himself mocking his wife, who never understood her husband's sense of humour.</div>

<div class="line_en">So when, a week later, Mrs Bennet discovered that her husband had in fact visited Mr Bingley at Netherfield, she was surprised and very pleased. But she and her daughters tried in vain to persuade Mr Bennet to describe the wealthy stranger, and in the end they had to rely on another neighbour's description.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所以，一周之后，班纳特太太得知丈夫实际上已到尼日斐拜访过彬格莱先生，感到十分惊奇和喜出望外。可是，她和女儿们怎么求都白搭，班纳特先生就是不肯向她们吐露这位阔少爷的情况，最后，她们不得不从另一位邻居那里探听消息。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He sounds wonderful, Mama!" cried Lydia, the youngest and noisiest of the sisters.

<div class="line_en">As politeness required, Mr Bingley came to visit Mr Bennet a few days later. He was not, however, fortunate enough to see the Bennet girls, who were hiding behind the curtains in an upstairs room in order to catch sight of the handsome stranger. Mrs Bennet planned to invite him to dinner, but in fact they met him at another social event first. The Bennets lived in the small Hertfordshire village of Longbourn, and public dances were regularly held in the nearest town, Meryton. The girls were greatly looking forward to this particular dance, because they had heard that Mr Bingley would be attending, with a group of friends from London.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="出于礼貌，彬格莱先生几天以后来回访班纳特先生。可是，遗憾的是，他未能见到班纳特家的几位姑娘，因为当时几个姑娘为了一睹这位英俊的陌生人的风采，正躲在楼上一间屋子的窗帘后面偷看呢。班纳特夫人计划邀请他吃饭，可是，事实上他们在另一次社交活动中提前见了面。班纳特一家住在哈福德郡的小村子浪搏恩，公共舞会定期在最近的镇子麦里屯举办。姑娘们在企盼着这次特别的舞会，因为她们听说彬格莱先生要参加，还要带些伦敦的朋友来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">On the night of the dance, all eyes were on Mr Bingley as he entered the room. He had brought his two sisters, with the husband of the elder, Mr Hurst, and another young man, Mr Darcy. Mr Bingley was indeed good-looking and gentleman-like, and his sisters were fine, fashionable women. However, everybody was soon talking about Mr Darcy, a tall, handsome man, who, it was said, had an income of ten thousand pounds a year. The ladies in the room gazed at him in admiration for about half the evening, until they became aware of his constant frown and his unwillingness to talk or dance. Then there was general agreement that he was proud and disagreeable, and considered himself superior to country people. Mr Bingley, on the other hand, made himself popular with the ladles by dancing every dance and talking to everybody.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="舞会的那天晚上，彬格莱先生走进舞厅时，所有的眼睛都盯住了他。他把姐姐和妹妹都带来了，还有姐夫赫斯特先生和另外一个年轻人达西先生。彬格莱先生确实仪表堂堂，风度翩翩。他的姐姐也是优雅入时的女人。可是，没过多久，人人都开始谈论达西先生。他身材魁梧，英俊潇洒，据说年收入一万英镑。舞厅里的女士们用爱慕的眼光盯了他半个晚上，直到后来她们感到他不住地皱眉，不愿说话也不愿跳舞。最后，大家一致认为这个人高傲自大，性情乖戾，觉得自己比乡下人高一等。而彬格莱先生每支曲子都跳，跟谁都交谈，博得了各位女士的喜欢。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As there were not as many gentlemen as ladies, Elizabeth Bennet did not have a partner for one of the dances, and was sitting watching the dancing. Mr Darcy was standing near her, and when Mr Bingley came up to speak to his friend, Elizabeth could not avoid hearing their conversation.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因为男士没有女士多，所以伊丽莎白·班纳特有一支曲子没有舞伴，坐着看大家跳。达西先生就站在她旁边。彬格莱先生过来跟朋友搭话时，伊丽莎白免不了听到他们的对话。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Certainly not," replied Darcy. "You know how I hate dancing with a partner I don't know. I would particularly dislike it at a village dance like this. Apart from your sisters, there isn't a woman in the room I would even consider dancing with. You are dancing with the only attractive girl here." He was looking at Mrs Bennet's eldest daughter Jane, who was waiting for Bingley to join her for the next dance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“当然不跳，”达西说，“你知道我多么讨厌跟陌生人跳舞，尤其是在乡下的舞会上。除了你的姐妹之外，跟这个屋子里别的女人跳舞我连想都不会想。只有一个迷人的女孩，还在跟你跳。”他看着班纳特太太的长女简，简正在等彬格莱与她一起跳下一支曲子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After the dance the Bennet and Bingley families began to visit each other every few days. It became evident that Mr Bingley admired Jane very much, and Elizabeth knew that her sister was close to falling in love with him.

<div class="line_cn" title="“有时候那是个错误，”夏洛特一边明智地摇摇头一边回答说，“如果她一点不表现出自己的感情，甚至对自己所爱的人都如此，那么，她可能会丧失捉住他的机会。简应当利用她和彬格莱相处的每个机会来吸引他，鼓励他。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, I wish Jane success with all my heart," said Charlotte finally, "but I think she'd have as much chance of happiness if she married him tomorrow, as if she studied his character for a whole year. Happiness in marriage is simply a question of chance. I think it's better to know as little as possible about the person you're going to spend your life with."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好吧，我真心希望简获得成功，”夏洛特最后说，“可是我认为，她明天和他结婚与研究他一年性格后再和他结婚同样可能获得幸福。婚姻上的幸福不过是个机遇问题。我想，对于和自己终生为伴的人还是了解得越少越好。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">While observing Mr Bingley's interest in Jane, however, Elizabeth had not noticed Mr Darcy's interest in herself. Although at first he had not even considered her pretty, he now began to realize what a beautiful expression her dark eyes gave to her intelligent face, and what an attractive figure she had. "Of course, she is only an unfashionable village girl," he told himself, "but her conversation is often quite amusing." Whenever they met, he did not speak to her, but stood near her, listening to her and watching her closely, conscious of a wish to know her better.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是，伊丽莎白在观察彬格莱先生对简的兴趣时，没有注意到达西先生对她本人的兴趣。虽然达西先生刚开始甚至想都没有想过伊丽莎白很漂亮，可是他现在开始认识到她那双乌黑的眼睛给她那聪慧的面庞增添了多么美的表情。“当然，她不过是一位土里土气的乡村姑娘，”他心里想，“可是她的谈话经常很有意思。”无论何时，他们俩见面时，达西都不和伊丽莎白说话，而是站在她近旁，听她说话，仔细地观察她，心里意识到自己想更多地了解她。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">One evening at a party at the Lucases' house, Darcy was standing alone, as usual, away from the other guests, watching the dancing. His host, Sir William, came to speak to him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一天晚上，在卢卡斯家的舞会上，达西像往常一样独自站着，离别的客人远远的，看着人家跳舞。主人威廉爵士过来跟他说话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Mr Darcy! Are you enjoying the dancing, sir? What a delightful entertainment it is!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“达西先生！您在欣赏舞会吗？多么轻松的娱乐呀！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Darcy frowned. "Yes," he said with cool disdain, "it's something that any uneducated person can be good at."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="达西皱了皱眉。“是的，”他冷冷地、不屑一顾地说，“跳舞嘛，连粗人都会学好。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm sure you're good at dancing yourself, sir," replied Sir William cheerfully. "Look! Here's Miss Elizabeth Bennet." She was crossing the room at that moment. "Let me persuade you to dance with her. You cannot refuse to dance when so much beauty is in front of you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我相信您本人也擅长跳舞，先生，”威廉爵士兴高采烈地回答。“你看，伊丽莎白·班纳特小姐来了。”她当时正在穿过房间。“让我来说服你跟她跳舞。这样的美貌就在眼前，怎么能谢绝不跳呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Indeed, sir," replied Elizabeth quickly, in some embarrassment, "I have no intention of dancing. You must excuse me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“真的，先生，”伊丽莎白迅速回答道，有点儿不好意思，“我不想跳舞，你务必原谅我。”">查看中文翻译</div>
