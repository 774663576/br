<div class="line_en">The problem was this: he didn't seem to recognize her talent. They'd spent all of last week reading the news from a teleprompter. Each time she finished, she immediately looked at him, but he barely glanced up from his notes. Rather, he spooled off a criticism as if he were relaying a recipe to a troublesome neighbor, then called out, "Next."</div>

<div class="line_en">By the end of her sophomore year, there was no doubt in Tully's mind that Chad Wiley knew who she was. She'd taken two of his classes: Broadcast Journalism I and II. Whatever he taught, she took; whatever he asked of her, she did. Full-bore. Balls to the wall.</div>

<div class="line_en">Day after day, week after week, class after class, Tully waited for him to respond to her obvious talent, to say, You're ready for KVTS. Now it was the first week of May. With about six weeks left in her sophomore year, she was still waiting.</div>

<div class="line_en">Plenty of things had changed in her life the past two years. She'd cut her hair shoulder-length and gone with bangs. Her style icon had gone from Farrah Fawcett-Majors to Jessica Savitch. Nineteen eighty was made for Tully: big hair, bright makeup, glittery fabric, and shoulder pads. No pale colors/sorority-girl styles for her. When she walked into a room these days, people noticed.</div>

<div class="line_en">But that was about to change; Tully was sure this time. Last week she'd finally racked enough credits to apply for a summer internship position at KVTS, the local public programming station that was housed on campus. She'd gotten up at six A. M. so that her name appeared first on the sign-up sheet. When she'd been given the audition piece, she'd gone home and practiced it endlessly, trying it at least a dozen different ways until she found the tone of voice that perfectly matched the tone of the story. Yesterday she'd nailed the audition. She was certain of it. Now, finally, it was time to found out what position she'd earned.</div>

<div class="line_en">The problem was love. Kate had spent all of their freshman year mooning over bad-haircut Brandt. By the time they finally dated, it was a letdown that ended fast. Still, Kate didn't seem to care. Through most of sophomore year, she'd dated Ted, who supposedly loved her, and then Eric, who most certainly did not. Kate went to one fraternity dance after another, and though she never fell in love with any of the doofuses she dated -- and definitely didn't have sex with them -- she talked about them constantly. Every sentence lately seemed to start with some guy's name. Even worse, she hardly ever mentioned the broadcasting plan. She seemed perfectly happy to take classes in other departments. Whenever one of their sorority sisters got engaged, Kate rushed to be a part of the crowd that swooned over the ring.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱情是最大的问题。一年级时，凯蒂都在迷恋发型老土的布兰特，终于开始交往之后幻想随即破灭，两人很快就分手了，但凯蒂似乎不放在心上。二年级大部分的时间她都和泰德交往，至少他好像爱她，后来又换了艾瑞克，这个则可以肯定不爱她。凯蒂参加了一场又一场兄弟会举办的舞会，总是和一些蠢货交往，虽然她并非认真爱他们，而且绝对没有和他们上床，但她老爱聊他们的事。最近她一开口总会说起某个男生的名字，更可恶的是她从不提及她们的新闻大业，而且似乎更喜欢跑去别的科系选修。每当姐妹会有学姐订婚，她便兴冲冲地和一堆人去参观戒指，一脸晕陶陶的蠢样。">查看中文翻译</div>

"You totally aren't looking."</div>

<div class="line_en">The campus was bathed in cool sunlight on this mid-May day. Every plant was in bloom and the grass was so thick and lush it looked like patches of green velvet tucked neatly between strips of cement. She strode confidently through campus to the building that housed KVTS. There, she paused just long enough to smooth her sprayed hair, then went into the quiet, utilitarian-looking hallway. To her left was a bulletin board thick with notices. Roommate wanted: pot smoker only was the first one that caught her eye. She noticed that all the phone-number tabs had been ripped off of it, while the ad next to it (Roommate wanted: Born-again Christian preferred) looked sadly intact.</div>

<div class="line_en">She knew what he was asking. As hard as she'd tried to conceal her innocence, he'd sensed it, tasted it. "Woman," she lied, with only the barest wobble on the w. She knew now, after just one kiss, that whatever there was to know about sex, her pathetic rape in the woods had taught her none of it. Although she wasn't a virgin, she was something worse somehow, a reservoir of bad and painful memories, and yet, now, with him, for the first time she wanted more.</div>

<div class="line_en">At the touch of his lips, gentle yet firm, she felt something exquisite and tender blossom inside her; for no reason at all, she started to cry. He must have tasted her tears, because he drew back, frowned at her. "Are you a woman, Tully Hart, or a girl?"</div>

Next, she spun through the TV room and their bedroom; she even checked on the sleeping porch, although at four o'clock on a sunny May day, it was understandably empty. She tried the undergraduate library and Kate's favorite carrel, then the graduate reading room, where several hippie-looking older students shushed her just for walking through the stacks. She was about ready to give up when she remembered the Annex.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="塔莉花了将近两个小时才找到凯蒂。一开始她先去姐妹会的地下读书室，接着又去电视间与卧房转了一圈，她甚至去大寝室看过，这种晴朗的五月下午，那里当然没半个人。她找过大学部图书馆里凯蒂最喜欢的研究室，接着又去了研究所阅览室，那里有几个嬉皮打扮的学长，她光是从书架间走过就被他们嘘。她正准备放弃时，忽然想起“小楼”。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He swept her into his arms and carried her to a broken-down sofa tucked against the shadowy back wall. There, he laid her down onto the bumpy, scratchy cushions and slowly, gently began to undress her. As if from far away, she felt her bra unsnap, her underpants peel off.

<div class="line_en">Kate bit her lip, stalling for time. She didn't want to hurt Tully's feeling or piss her off, but what kind of friend would she be if she lied? The truth was, she had liked Chad and she believed he truly cared about Tully; it was also true that she had a bad feeling about their relationship and meeting him had only made it worse.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凯蒂咬着下唇拖延时间。她不想伤塔莉的感情也不想惹她发火，但在这种时候说谎还算朋友吗？老实说，她确实喜欢查德，她相信查德真心关怀塔莉，但她不看好这段感情，见过他之后，这样的预感更强了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I wasn't going to say anything, Tully, but since you're forcing me… I don't think you should be going out with him." Once her opinion broke through the dam, she couldn't stop. "I mean, he's thirty-one years old. He has an ex-wife and a four-year-old daughter he never sees. You can't be seen publicly with him or he'll get fired. What kind of relationship is that? You're missing your college years."</div>
