<div class="line_en">But way off alone, out by himself beyond boat and shore, Jonathan Livingston Seagull was practicing. A hundred feet in the sky he lowered his webbed feet, lifted his beak, and strained to old a painful hard twisting curve through his wings. The curve meant that he would fly slowly, and now he slowed until the wind was a whisper in his face, until the ocean stood still beneath him. He narrowed his eyes in fierce concentration, held his breath, forced one… single… more… inch… of… curve… Then his featliers ruffled, he stalled and fell.</div>

<div class="line_en">Most gulls don't bother to learn more than the simplest facts of flight -- how to get from shore to food and back again. For most gulls, it is not flying that matters, but eating. For this gull, though, it was not eating that mattered, but flight. More than anything else. Jonathan Livingston Seagull loved to fly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大多数海鸥只求学会最简单的飞行本领一一如何从岸上飞出去觅食，再飞回来。对他们来说，重要的不是飞行，而是觅食。但对这只海鸥来说，重要的不是吃而是飞。乔纳森喜爱飞行胜于一切。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This kind of thinking, he found, is not the way to make one's self popular with other birds. Even his parents were dismayed as Jonathan spent whole days alone, making hundreds of low-level glides, experimenting.</div>

<div class="line_en">He didn't know why, for instance, but when he flew at altitudes less than half his wingspan above the water, he could stay in the air longer, with less effort. His glides ended not with the usual feet-down splash into the sea, but with a long flat wake as he touched the surface with his feet tightly streamlined against his body. When he began sliding in to feet-up landings on the beach, then pacing the length of his slide in the sand, his parents were very much dismayed indeed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他自己也不知道是什么原故，只要他保持离水面不到半翅的高度作低空飞行，他就能在空中停留较久，费劲较小。他滑翔下来并不像一般鸟儿那样伸下双足溅落海中，而是蜷起双足紧贴着身体掠过海面，在水面留下长长一道波纹。他蜷起双足在沙滩上滑翔着陆，然后步测着沙滩上滑翔的距离，他的父母见了，着实为他担忧。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">From a thousand feet, flapping his wings as hard as he could, he pushed over into a blazing steep dive toward the waves, and learned why seagulls don't make blazing steep power-dives. In just six seconds he was moving seventy miles per hour, the speed at which one's wing goes unstable on the upstroke.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从一千英尺高空，他使劲地拍着翅膀，朝着海浪垂直疾降，于是他懂得了海鸥不作垂直疾降的道理。在六秒钟内，他以每小时七十英里的速度运动。在这样的速度下，翅膀向上一举，就会失去平衡。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When Jonathan Seagull joined the Flock on the beach, it was full night. He was dizzy and terribly tired. Yet in delight he flew a loop to landing, with a snap roll just before touchdown. When they hear of it, he thought, of the Breakthrough, they'll be wild with joy. How much more there is now to living! Instead of our drab slogging forth and back to the fishing boats, there's a reason to life! We can lift ourselves out of ignorance, we can find ourselves as creatures of excellence and intelligence and skill. We can be free! We can learn to fly!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一个斤斗翻下来，即将着陆时还来了个快滚。他想，海鸥们得知他打破了飞行纪录，一定会欣喜若狂动。生活现在变得多么有意义啊！除了单调地围绕着渔船盘旋外，生活还有其他目的！我们能够摆脱愚昧，我们能够使自己成为有才能、有智慧、有技巧的生灵。我们能够获得自由！我们能够学会飞行！">查看中文翻译</div>

Stand to Center for Honor was the way the gulls' foremost leaders were marked. Of course, he thought, the Breakfast Flock this morning; they saw the Breakthrough! But I want no honors. I have no wish to be leader. I want only to share what I've found, to show those horizons out ahead for us all.</div>

<div class="line_en">Jonathan Seagull spent the rest of his days alone, but he flew way out beyond the Far Cliffs. His one sorrow was not solitude, it was that other gulls refused to believe the glory of flight that awaited them; they refused to open their eyes and see. He learned more each day. He learned that a streamlined high-speed dive could bring him to find the rare and tasty fish that schooled ten feet below the surface of the ocean: he no longer needed fishing boats and stale bread for survival. He learned to sleep in the air, setting a course at night across the offshore wind, covering a hundred miles from sunset to sunrise. With the same inner control, he flew through heavy sea-fogs and climbed above them into dazzling clear skies… in the very times when every other gull stood on the ground, knowing nothing but mist and rain. He learned to ride the high winds far inland, to dine there on delicate insects.</div>
