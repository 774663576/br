<div class="line_en">A very happy personage in the year of grace 1482, was the noble gentleman Robert d'Estouteville, chevalier, Sieur de Beyne, Baron d'Ivry and Saint Andry en la Marche, counsellor and chamberlain to the king, and guard of the provostship of Paris. It was already nearly seventeen years since he had received from the king, on November 7, 1465, the comet year, that fine charge of the provostship of Paris, which was reputed rather a seigneury than an office. Dignitas, says Joannes Loemnoeus, quoe cum non exigua potestate politiam concernente, atque proerogativis multis et juribus conjuncta est. A marvellous thing in '82 was a gentleman bearing the king's commission, and whose letters of institution ran back to the epoch of the marriage of the natural daughter of Louis XI. with Monsieur the Bastard of Bourbon.</div>

<div class="line_en">The same day on which Robert d'Estouteville took the place of Jacques de Villiers in the provostship of Paris, Master Jehan Dauvet replaced Messire Helye de Thorrettes in the first presidency of the Court of Parliament, Jehan Jouvenel des Ursins supplanted Pierre de Morvilliers in the office of chancellor of France, Regnault des Dormans ousted Pierre Puy from the charge of master of requests in ordinary of the king's household. Now, upon how many heads had the presidency, the chancellorship, the mastership passed since Robert d'Estouteville had held the provostship of Paris. It had been "granted to him for safekeeping," as the letters patent said; and certainly he kept it well. He had clung to it, he had incorporated himself with it, he had so identified himself with it that he had escaped that fury for change which possessed Louis XI., a tormenting and industrious king, whose policy it was to maintain the elasticity of his power by frequent appointments and revocations. More than this; the brave chevalier had obtained the reversion of the office for his son, and for two years already, the name of the noble man Jacques d'Estouteville, equerry, had figured beside his at the head of the register of the salary list of the provostship of Paris. A rare and notable favor indeed! It is true that Robert d'Estouteville was a good soldier, that he had loyally raised his pennon against "the league of public good," and that he had presented to the queen a very marvellous stag in confectionery on the day of her entrance to Paris in 14…Moreover, he possessed the good friendship of Messire Tristan l'Hermite, provost of the marshals of the king's household. Hence a very sweet and pleasant existence was that of Messire Robert. In the first place, very good wages, to which were attached, and from which hung, like extra bunches of grapes on his vine, the revenues of the civil and criminal registries of the provostship, plus the civil and criminal revenues of the tribunals of Embas of the Châtelet, without reckoning some little toll from the bridges of Mantes and of Corbeil, and the profits on the craft of Shagreen-makers of Paris, on the corders of firewood and the measurers of salt. Add to this the pleasure of displaying himself in rides about the city, and of making his fine military costume, which you may still admire sculptured on his tomb in the abbey of Valmont in Normandy, and his morion, all embossed at Montlhéry, stand out a contrast against the parti-colored red and tawny robes of the aldermen and police. And then, was it nothing to wield absolute supremacy over the sergeants of the police, the porter and watch of the Châtelet, the two auditors of the Châtelet, auditores castelleti, the sixteen commissioners of the sixteen quarters, the jailer of the Châtelet, the four enfeoffed sergeants, the hundred and twenty mounted sergeants, with maces, the chevalier of the watch with his watch, his sub-watch, his counter-watch and his rear-watch? Was it nothing to exercise high and low justice, the right to interrogate, to hang and to draw, without reckoning petty jurisdiction in the first resort (in prima instantia, as the charters say), on that viscomty of Paris, so nobly appanaged with seven noble bailiwicks? Can anything sweeter be imagined than rendering judgments and decisions, as Messire Robert d'Estouteville daily did in the Grand Châtelet, under the large and flattened arches of Philip Augustus? and going, as he was wont to do every evening, to that charming house situated in the Rue Galilee, in the enclosure of the royal palace, which he held in right of his wife, Madame Ambroise de Lore, to repose after the fatigue of having sent some poor wretch to pass the night in "that little cell of the Rue de Escorcherie, which the provosts and aldermen of Paris used to make their prison; the same being eleven feet long, seven feet and four inches wide, and eleven feet high?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="罗伯·戴屠维耳接替雅各·德·维利埃为巴黎府尹的同一日，约翰·多维代替埃利·德·托瑞特为大理寺正卿，约翰·儒夫奈·德·于尔散取代彼埃尔·德·莫尔维利埃为法兰西掌玺官，雷尼奥·德·多尔芒继彼埃尔·皮伊为大内日常供奉。然而，就罗伯·戴屠维耳来说，自从他执掌巴黎大印以来，正卿、掌玺官、供奉不知换了多少！恩诏曰：“锡其永世”，诚然，他牢牢保持着职位，紧抓住不放，长入其中，合而为一，以至于逃脱了路易十一那发疯似的撤换狂的打击。这位国王猜疑成性，吹毛求疵，勤奋异常，喜欢频繁任命和撤换，保持他政权的弹性。此外，咱们这位骑士已经为儿子求得荫封，两年前贵人雅各·戴屠维耳候补骑士（3），已经出现在父亲的名字旁边，列在巴黎府尹衙门礼仪书之首。当然是罕见的殊恩！确实，罗伯·戴屠维耳是个好军人，曾为效忠王上高举起枪旗（4）反对“公共福利联盟”；一四××年王后进入巴黎的那一天，他也曾送她一份厚礼：是一只糖果做的鹿。况且，他与总御马监特里斯唐·赖米特私交甚笃。因此，罗伯老爷的生活过得挺美满、挺开心。首先，他的官俸异常可观，此外还要加上——就像他的葡萄园里额外增加的葡萄——附带的收入：府尹衙门民事和刑事诉讼登记费的收入，还有小堡的昂巴公判庭，还不算上芒特科—贝伊桥上某种小额买路钱，以及对巴黎鲨皮革制造商、对柴禾衡量吏和食盐衡量吏征收的捐税。另外，还有一种乐趣，就是，在骑马游街的时候展示他那漂亮的军服（今天还可以在诺曼底的瓦耳曼教堂他的坟墓上看见，而刺绣华丽的高头盔在蒙特里也还可以看见），夹杂在地方法官和区长们半红半褐袍子中间分外耀眼。况且，压倒以下人等，难道不算什么吗：什二长，小堡的司阍兼巡夜，小堡的两名检查官（auditores Castelleti），十六个居民区的十六名区长，小堡的狱吏，四名有采邑的什长，一百二十名骑马的什长，一百二十名执棒的什长，巡夜骑士及其巡防队、巡防小队、巡防检查队、巡防后卫队？他还施行高级和初级司法权，执掌碾刑、绞刑、拖刑，外加第一审（按特权凭券上的说法，in prima instantia（5）），司法权施行于全巴黎子爵采邑，光荣地兼及七个贵族典吏所辖范围，这难道也不算什么？像罗伯·戴屠维耳老爷这样每天在大堡里菲利浦—奥古斯都式宽阔扁平的尖拱穹隆下，下令逮捕和审判，难道咱们想象得出有比这更为惬意的事情？每晚按照习惯，前往伽利略街，位于王宫近旁，根据妻子昂勃罗瓦丝·德·洛瑞夫人的权利而拥有的那栋漂亮宅第去过夜，消除把某个可怜的家伙投入监狱去过夜而致生的疲劳，又岂不美哉？那个家伙“在剥皮场街的小笼子里过夜，这种笼子是巴黎府尹和法官们根据规定给这种人安排的牢房，只有十一尺长、七尺四寸宽、十一尺高”。【注：（3）骑士的儿子可以求得的一种封号，不列入贵族勋位。（4）骑士在长矛上端打出小三角旗，标示自己的封号等等，叫做“枪旗”。（5）拉丁文，第一审。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Here, assuredly, is more than sufficient to render a life happy and illustrious, and to deserve some day a notable page in that interesting history of the provosts of Paris, where one learns that Oudard de Villeneuve had a house in the Rue des Boucheries, that Guillaume de Hangest purchased the great and the little Savoy, that Guillaume Thiboust gave the nuns of Sainte-Geneviève his houses in the Rue Clopin, that Hugues Aubriot lived in the Hôtel du Pore-Epic, and other domestic facts.</div>

<div class="line_en">And not only had Messire Robert d'Estouteville his special court as provost and vicomte of Paris; but in addition he had a share, both for eye and tooth, in the grand court of the king. There was no head in the least elevated which had not passed through his hands before it came to the headsman. It was he who went to seek M. de Nemours at the Bastille Saint Antoine, in order to conduct him to the Halles; and to conduct to the Grève M. de Saint-Pol, who clamored and resisted, to the great joy of the provost, who did not love monsieur the constable.</div>

<div class="line_en">Moreover, it was the day after a festival, a tiresome day for every one, and above all for the magistrate who is charged with sweeping away all the filth, properly and figuratively speaking, which a festival day produces in Paris. And then he had to hold a sitting at the Grand Châtelet. Now, we have noticed that judges in general so arrange matters that their day of audience shall also be their day of bad humor, so that they may always have some one upon whom to vent it conveniently, in the name of the king, law, and justice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="况且，这是节日的第二天，对于任何人都是厌烦的一日，尤其对于府尹是如此，因为他必须负责把节日在巴黎造成的具体的以及抽象的垃圾统统打扫干净。此外，他还必须赶往大堡去开庭。我们早已发现：当法官的一般总是设法使自己在开庭的这一天心情特别不好，得以碰上哪个倒霉蛋，以国王、法律和正义的名义，把怨气发泄在他身上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Nevertheless, with so many reasons for taking life patiently and joyously, Messire Robert d'Estouteville woke up on the morning of the seventh of January, 1482, in a very surly and peevish mood. Whence came this ill temper? He could not have told himself. Was it because the sky was gray? or was the buckle of his old belt of Montlhéry badly fastened, so that it confined his provostal portliness too closely? had he beheld ribald fellows, marching in bands of four, beneath his window, and setting him at defiance, in doublets but no shirts, hats without crowns, with wallet and bottle at their side? Was it a vague presentiment of the three hundred and seventy livres, sixteen sous, eight farthings, which the future King Charles VII. was to cut off from the provostship in the following year? The reader can take his choice; we, for our part, are much inclined to believe that he was in a bad humor, simply because he was in a bad humor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尽管有这么许多理由，可以耐心而愉快地对待生活，一四八二年一月七日早晨，罗伯·戴屠维耳一觉醒来，心情却恶劣之至。是什么缘故呢？他自己也说不清楚。是不是因为天色灰暗？是不是因为他那蒙特里式腰带的环扣扣起来不合适，把府尹发福的官体箍得太紧，太像一介武夫？是不是因为他看见窗下一大帮子贱民四人一排走了过去，外衣里面不穿衬衫，高帽子却没有顶，腰侧挂着钱包，别着酒瓶，向他大声嘲笑？还是因为隐隐约约预感到嗣君查理八世来年即将把府尹的官俸削减三百七十利弗十六索耳八德尼埃？听凭读者任择其一。至于我们，我们倾向于干脆认为，他心情恶劣就是因为他心情恶劣。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The hall was small, low, vaulted. A table studded with fleurs-de-lis stood at one end, with a large arm-chair of carved oak, which belonged to the provost and was empty, and a stool on the left for the auditor, Master Florian. Below sat the clerk of the court, scribbling; opposite was the populace; and in front of the door, and in front of the table were many sergeants of the provostship in sleeveless jackets of violet camlet, with white crosses. Two sergeants of the Parloir-aux-Bourgeois, clothed in their jackets of Toussaint, half red, half blue, were posted as sentinels before a low, closed door, which was visible at the extremity of the hall, behind the table. A single pointed window, narrowly encased in the thick wall, illuminated with a pale ray of January sun two grotesque figures,-- the capricious demon of stone carved as a tail-piece in the keystone of the vaulted ceiling, and the judge seated at the end of the hall on the fleurs-de-lis.</div>

His lieutenants, civil, criminal, and private, were doing his work, according to usage; and from eight o'clock in the morning, some scores of bourgeois and bourgeoises, heaped and crowded into an obscure corner of the audience chamber of Embas du Châtelet, between a stout oaken barrier and the wall, had been gazing blissfully at the varied and cheerful spectacle of civil and criminal justice dispensed by Master Florian Barbedienne, auditor of the Châtelet, lieutenant of monsieur the provost, in a somewhat confused and utterly haphazard manner.</div>

<div class="line_en">Meanwhile Master Florian, the auditor, turned over attentively the document in the complaint entered against Quasimodo, which the clerk handed him, and, having thus glanced at it, appeared to reflect for a moment. Thanks to this precaution, which he always was careful to take at the moment when on the point of beginning an examination, he knew beforehand the names, titles, and misdeeds of the accused, made cut and dried responses to questions foreseen, and succeeded in extricating himself from all the windings of the interrogation without allowing his deafness to be too apparent. The written charges were to him what the dog is to the blind man. If his deafness did happen to betray him here and there, by some incoherent apostrophe or some unintelligible question, it passed for profundity with some, and for imbecility with others. In neither case did the honor of the magistracy sustain any injury; for it is far better that a judge should be reputed imbecile or profound than deaf. Hence he took great care to conceal his deafness from the eyes of all, and he generally succeeded so well that he had reached the point of deluding himself, which is, by the way, easier than is supposed. All hunchbacks walk with their heads held high, all stutterers harangue, all deaf people speak low. As for him, he believed, at the most, that his ear was a little refractory. It was the sole concession which he made on this point to public opinion, in his moments of frankness and examination of his conscience.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这当儿，庭长弗洛里昂老爷仔细翻了翻录事呈交给他的指控卡席莫多的卷宗，这样过目之后，好像静静考虑了一会。每次开始审讯之前，他总要预先小心筹划一番，所以事先对被告的姓名、身份、犯案心中早已有底，预料到对方会有怎样的回答，自己早已盘算好怎样予以驳斥，任凭审讯怎样曲折迂回，他也总能对付过去，并不过分显出自己重听。案卷对于他就像是给瞎子引路的狗。万一有那么一句半句前言不搭后语，或者所提问题不可理解，泄露出他的残疾，在某些人看来会显得深奥，在另一些人看来则是鲁钝，但是，无论是两种情况中的哪一种，反正司法官的荣誉不会受到损害，因为当法官的宁可被认为鲁钝或深奥，却不可耳聋。因此，他处心积虑不让任何人看破自己耳闭听塞，而且通常掩饰得极为成功，连他自己也产生了错觉。这样的自欺，其实比咱们所能想象的容易得多。凡是驼子走起路来总是昂首阔步，结巴子说话喜欢长篇大论，聋子偏爱小声嘀咕。至于弗洛里昂老爷，他至多只认为自己耳朵有点不听使唤罢了。这是他关于这一点，向公众舆论作出的唯一让步，还得在他坦率无隐、审视良心的时刻。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was Quasimodo, bound, encircled, roped, pinioned, and under good guard. The squad of policemen who surrounded him was assisted by the chevalier of the watch in person, wearing the arms of France embroidered on his breast, and the arms of the city on his back. There was nothing, however, about Quasimodo, except his deformity, which could justify the display of halberds and arquebuses; he was gloomy, silent, and tranquil. Only now and then did his single eye cast a sly and wrathful glance upon the bonds with which he was loaded.</div>

<div class="line_en">Having, then, thoroughly ruminated Quasimodo's affair, he threw back his head and half closed his eyes, for the sake of more majesty and impartiality, so that, at that moment, he was both deaf and blind.

<div class="line_en">"That will do," went on the imperturbable auditor, when he supposed that the accused had finished his third reply. "You are accused before us, primo, of nocturnal disturbance; secundo, of a dishonorable act of violence upon the person of a foolish woman, in proejudicium meretricis; tertio, of rebellion and disloyalty towards the archers of the police of our lord, the king.

<div class="line_en">At this unlucky question, a burst of laughter rose from the clerk's table caught by the audience, so violent, so wild, so contagious, so universal, that the two deaf men were forced to perceive it. Quasimodo turned round, shrugging his hump with disdain, while Master Florian, equally astonished, and supposing that the laughter of the spectators had been provoked by some irreverent reply from the accused, rendered visible to him by that shrug of the shoulders, apostrophized him indignantly,—</div>

<div class="line_en">This sally was not fitted to arrest the explosion of general merriment. It struck all as so whimsical, and so ridiculous, that the wild laughter even attacked the sergeants of the Parloi-aux-Bourgeois, a sort of pikemen, whose stupidity was part of their uniform. Quasimodo alone preserved his seriousness, for the good reason that he understood nothing of what was going on around him. The judge, more and more irritated, thought it his duty to continue in the same tone, hoping thereby to strike the accused with a terror which should react upon the audience, and bring it back to respect.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这样的詈骂，丝毫也不能制止全场哈哈大笑。大家都觉得太奇怪，莫名其妙，笑得个前仰后翻，甚至市民厅什长们也克制不住了，而他们差不多应该是黑桃J（13），痴呆应是他们身上的制服的一部分。只有卡席莫多保持着一本正经的模样，原因很简单：他根本不明白周围发生了什么。法官越来越恼怒，认为必须继续使用恶狠狠的腔调，希望以此慑服被告，作用于听众，迫使他们恢复敬畏。【注：（13）扑克牌的黑桃花色的J，在法语里，从来源上说，原为“仆役”、“随从”之意，后转为“骑士”。在扑克牌上，画的是手执矛戟的武士，形象痴呆。】">查看中文翻译</div>

God knows where and when Master Florian would have landed, when thus launched at full speed in lofty eloquence, if the low door at the extreme end of the room had not suddenly opened, and given entrance to the provost in person. At his entrance Master Florian did not stop short, but, making a half-turn on his heels, and aiming at the provost the harangue with which he had been withering Quasimodo a moment before,— "Monseigneur," said he, "I demand such penalty as you shall deem fitting against the prisoner here present, for grave and aggravated offence against the court."</div>
