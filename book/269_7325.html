<div class="line_en">I wasn't sure what the hell I was doing here was I trying to push myself back into the zombie stupor? Had I turned masochistic -- developed a taste for torture? I should have gone straight down to La Push I felt much, much healthier around Jacob This was not a healthy thing to do.</div>

<div class="line_en">The truth was that I wanted to hear his voice again, like I had in the strange delusion Friday night. For that brief moment, when his voice came from some other part of me than my conscious memory, when his voice was perfect and honey smooth rather than the pale echo my memories usually produced, I was able to remember without pain. It hadn't lasted; the pain had caught up with me, as I was sure it would for this fool's errand. But those precious moments when I could hear him again were an irresistible lure. I had to find some way to repeat the experience… or maybe the better word was episode.</div>

<div class="line_en">And the house was there, but it was not the same. Though nothing had changed on the outside, the emptiness screamed from the blank windows. It was creepy. For the first time since I'd seen the beautiful house, it looked like a fitting haunt for vampires.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="房子仍然在那里，但是已经不同了。虽然外面看来没有任何的改变，从空洞洞窗户那传来空虚的呐喊。让人毛骨悚然。从我看到这栋美丽的房子至今，我第一次有了这样的感觉，这好像真是一个适合吸血鬼居住的地方。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The thick, almost jungle-like growth crawled slowly past my windows. The drive wound on and on. I started to go faster, getting edgy. How long had I been driving? Shouldn't I have reached the house yet? The lane was so overgrown that it did not look familiar.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那些茂盛的、几乎像丛林一样的生长物慢慢的爬过我的车窗。我好像在不停的开着车。于是我开始加速，变得不安起来。我已经开了有多久了。难道我不应该已经到达那栋房子了吗？车道上杂草丛生，使它看起来很陌生。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">What if I couldn't find it? I shivered. What if there was no tangible proof at all?</div>

<div class="line_en">Then there was the break in the trees that I was looking for, only it was not so pronounced as before. The flora here did not wait long to reclaim any land that was left unguarded. The tall ferns had infiltrated the meadow around the house, crowding against the trunks of the cedars, even the wide porch. It was like the lawn had been flooded -- waist-high -- with green, feathery waves.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后树林里出现了我寻找的缺口，只是它没有以前那么明显了。这里的植物迫不及待的收回了它余下的尚未守护的地方。高高的羊齿植物蔓延到了屋子周围的草坪上，簇拥在雪松树干的四周，甚至是宽敞的门廊上。草坪好像被绿色的、羽毛状的波浪淹没了——它们有齐腰深了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I approached the barren, vacant face slowly, my truck rumbling out a comforting roar behind me. I stopped when I got to the porch stairs, because there was nothing here. No lingering sense of their presence… of his presence. The house was solidly here, but it meant little. Its concrete reality would not counteract the nothingness of the nightmares.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我慢慢的靠近那栋空荡荡的房子，卡车的引擎在我身后发出令人安慰的咆哮声。当我到达门廊的台阶时，我停了下来，因为那里什么都没用。没有留下任何他们存在过的痕迹……以及他存在的痕迹。房子还是稳固的立在那，但是它已经毫无意义。它是现在存在的实物，但是这仍然没法消除我噩梦里的空虚感。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But wouldn't it be worse if there were no change? If the couches sat just as I'd last seen them, the paintings on the walls -- worse still, the piano on its low platform? It would be second only to the house disappearing all together, to see that there was no physical possession that tied them in anyway. That everything remained, untouched and forgotten, behind them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是如果没有任何改变难道不会更糟吗？如果沙发还放在我上次看到它们的地方，墙上还挂着油画——更糟的是，钢琴还放在低平台上？这仅次于房子全部消失了，看不见任何于他们相关的有形物体。一切都还留在这里，却在他们走后变得无人触及被人遗忘。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I didn't go any closer. I didn't want to look in the windows. I wasn't sure which would be harder to see. If the rooms were bare, echoing empty from floor to ceiling, that would certainly hurt. Like my grandmother's funeral, when my mother had insisted that I stay outside during the viewing. She had said that I didn't need to see Gran that way, to remember her that way, rather than alive.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我没有再走进一些。我不想往窗户里看。我不确定看到什么会让我更难受。如果房间里是空的，空洞的回音在地板和天花板间回荡，这一定会让我难过。就像在我外婆的葬礼上，我妈妈坚持让我在遗体告别时待在外面。她说宁愿记住外婆在世的模样，我没必要看到外婆的这个样子，没必要用这种方式记住她。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I turned my back on the gaping emptiness and hurried to my truck. I nearly ran. I was anxious to be gone, to get back to the human world.

<div class="line_en">He walked me to my car, less exuberant than before. It reminded me so clearly of my first months in Forks. I'd come full circle, and now everything felt like an echo -- an empty echo, devoid of the interest it used to have.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“嗨，孩子们，”他说，他的眼睛盯着厨房那边。我花了一个下午做出的宽面条发出的香味——雅各布在旁别看着我做偶尔也会品尝一下——飘到了大厅了，我表现的很听话，努力补偿他订的那些披萨。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I cleaned the house the next morning -- waiting for Jacob to call and trying to shake off the Litest nightmare. The scenery had changed. Last night I'd wandered in a wide sea of ferns interspersed with huge hemlock trees. There was nothing else there, and I was lost, wandering aimless and alone, searching for nothing. I wanted to kick myself for the stupid field trip last week. I shoved the dream out of my conscious mind, hoping it would stay locked up somewhere and not escape again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天早上我把房子打扫了一边——等着雅各布打电话过来并试图摆脱昨晚的噩梦。梦里的景象改变了。昨晚我迷失在一片羊齿植物丛中，里面还点缀着巨大的铁杉树。那里什么都没有，我迷路了，漫无目的、孤零零的徘徊着，不知道在寻找着什么。我真该为上个星期的那次愚蠢的实地考察而好好责备一下自己。我把那个梦挤出我的脑海，希望把它锁到什么地方不要让它逃出来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I parked my truck off to the side of the Blacks' house, close to the trees, to make it easier for us to sneak the bikes out.

<div class="line_cn" title="“准备好了吗？”他小声的问道，他的眼睛闪闪发亮。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I was driving slowly, so that I could safely stare out across the ocean now and then, as the road wound closer to the sea cliffs. Jacob was talking about finishing the bikes, but his descriptions were getting technical, so I wasn't paying close attention.</div>

The dirt road wove in and out of the forest -- sometimes there was nothing but trees, and then there would suddenly be a breathtaking glimpse of the Pacific Ocean, reaching to the horizon, dark gray under the clouds. We were above the shore, on top of the cliffs that bordered the beach here and the view seemed to stretch on forever.</div>

<div class="line_en">That was when I noticed four figures standing on a rocky ledge, much too close to the precipice. I couldn't tell from the distance how old they were, but I assumed they were men. Despite the chill in the air today, they seemed to be wearing only shorts.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在这时我注意到四个人正站在岩石的暗礁上，他们离断崖非常的近。因为距离太远我看不出来他们有多大，但是我确信他们是男人。尽管今天的空气非常寒冷，他们看起来只穿了短袖。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“那个人——他刚刚从悬崖上跳下去了！他们为什么不阻止他？我们得叫救护车！”我猛地打开门准备下车，这显然毫无意义。打电话最快的方式是回到比利家。但是我没法相信我刚刚所看到的。也许，潜意识里，我希望在没有挡风玻璃阻挡视线的情况下看到一些不一样的情况。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“悬崖跳水？”我重复着，有些茫然。我不可置信的看着第二个人走向悬崖的边缘，停顿了一下，然后非常优雅的纵身跃向空中。他下落的过程与我看来就像是永恒一样，最后他平稳的落入了下面灰黑色的波浪里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, yeah, most of us jump from lower down, that rock that juts out from the cliff about halfway." He pointed out his window. The place he indicated did seem much more reasonable. "Those guys are insane. Probably showing off how tough they are. I mean, really, it's freezing today. That water can't feel good." He made a disgruntled face, as if the stunt personally offended him. It surprised me a little. I would have thought Jacob was nearly impossible to upset.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“噢，是的，我们大多数人会从较低的地方跳下去，就是悬崖的半山腰上突出的那块岩石上。”他从窗户里向外指到。他指出的那个地方看起来要合情合理多了。“那些家伙太疯狂了。也许是为了炫耀他们有多么强壮吧。我是意思是，真的，今天实在是太冷了。海水一定不会让人感到舒服。”他的脸上露出不满的情绪，好像那个绝技是针对他的，并冒犯了他。这让我有点惊讶。我一直认为雅各布几乎是不可能有不开心的时候。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Sure, sure." He shrugged and grinned. "It's fun. A little scary, kind of a rush."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“这么明显吗？”他讽刺的问道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yeah. Annoying is a good word. They're always showing off -- like the cliff thing. They act like… like, I don't know. Like tough guys. I was hanging out at the store with Embry and Quil once, last semester, and Sam came by with his followers, Jared and Paul. Quil said something, you know how he's got a big mouth, and it pissed Paul off. His eyes got all dark, and he sort of smiled -- no, he showed his teeth but he didn't smile -- and it was like he was so mad he was shaking or something. But Sam put his hand against Paul's chest and shook his head. Paul looked at him for a minute and calmed down. Honestly, it was like Sam was holding him back -- like Paul was going to tear us up if Sam didn't stop him." He groaned. "Like a bad western. You know, Sam's a pretty big guy, he's twenty. But Paul's just sixteen, too, shorter than me and not as beefy as Quil. I think any one of us could take him."</div>

Why his opinion counts the most. It's got something to do with his father and his father's father.
