<div class="line_en">Sarah had managed to pry apart the shells with her unhandy weapon far enough to nibble a wee bit at the cold and clammy world within. She knew no more shorthand than if she had been a graduate in stenography just let slip upon the world by a business college. So, not being able to stenog, she could not enter that bright galaxy of office talent. She was a free-lance typewriter and canvassed for odd jobs of copying.</div>

<div class="line_en">The most brilliant and crowning feat of Sarah's battle with the world was the deal she made with Schulenberg's Home Restaurant. The restaurant was next door to the old red brick in which she ball- roomed. One evening after dining at Schulenberg's 40-cent, five- course table d'hote (served as fast as you throw the five baseballs at the coloured gentleman's head) Sarah took away with her the bill of fare. It was written in an almost unreadable script neither English nor German, and so arranged that if you were not careful you began with a toothpick and rice pudding and ended with soup and the day of the week.</div>

The hand-organs still played "In the Good Old Summertime," with their December vivacity and expression. Men began to make thirty-day notes to buy Easter dresses. Janitors shut off steam.

<div class="line_en">To-day there were more changes on the bill of fare than usual. The soups were lighter; pork was eliminated from the entrees, figuring only with Russian turnips among the roasts. The gracious spirit of spring pervaded the entire menu. Lamb, that lately capered on the greening hillsides, was becoming exploited with the sauce that commemorated its gambols. The song of the oyster, though not silenced, was diminuendo con amore. The frying-pan seemed to be held, inactive, behind the beneficent bars of the broiler. The pie list swelled; the richer puddings had vanished; the sausage, with his drapery wrapped about him, barely lingered in a pleasant thanatopsis with the buckwheats and the sweet but doomed maple.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在今天的菜单上，变动的项目比平时多得多。各种汤菜更加清淡；猪肉从主菜中取消，仅仅在烤肉中同俄国芜菁一起出现。春天的气息迷漫着整个菜谱。最近还嬉戏在绿色山坡的羔羊即将同念记它嬉戏的调味品一同搬上餐桌。牡蛎的歌声，虽还没有止息，已引不起人们的注意了。煎锅似乎收起来没用，放在烤焙架的后面。馅饼的种类大大增加；油腻的布丁完全消失；装饰包扎的香肠仅仅同荞麦和糖混在一起作垂死挣扎，带着注定灭亡的淡棕色。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But what a witch is Spring! Into the great cold city of stone and iron a message had to be sent. There was none to convey it but the little hardy courier of the fields with his rough green coat and modest air. He is a true soldier of fortune, this dent-de-lion -- this lion's tooth, as the French chefs call him. Flowered, he will assist at love-making, wreathed in my lady's nut-brown hair; young and callow and unblossomed, he goes into the boiling pot and delivers the word of his sovereign mistress.</div>

<div class="line_en">At 6 o'clock the waiter brought her dinner and carried away the typewritten bill of fare. When Sarah ate she set aside, with a sigh, the dish of dandelions with its crowning ovarious accompaniment. As this dark mass had been transformed from a bright and love-indorsed flower to be an ignominious vegetable, so had her summer hopes wilted and perished. Love may, as Shakespeare said, feed on itself: but Sarah could not bring herself to eat the dandelions that had graced, as ornaments, the first spiritual banquet of her heart's true affection.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="六点钟，侍者给她送来晚餐，把打好的菜单取走。吃饭时，她把蒲公英同果核配搭的一道菜放在旁边。由于这盘黑色的东西从光艳夺目、象征爱情的鲜花变成了一份可鄙的菜肴，因此她夏天的期望就枯萎死亡了。正如莎士比亚所言，爱情可以自己养活自己，但萨拉根本不能使自己吃下这份以蒲公英制作的美味，这是心爱的第一次精神宴席啊！">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The young farmer smiled a springtime smile. "I dropped into that Home Restaurant next door this evening," said he. "I don't care who knows it; I like a dish of some kind of greens at this time of the year. I ran my eye down that nice typewritten bill of fare looking for something in that line. When I got below cabbage I turned my chair over and hollered for the proprietor. He told me where you lived."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="年轻的农民满面春风地笑了笑。“今天晚上，我偶然到隔壁那家家庭餐馆去，”他说。“我才不管它有没有名气哩；每年的这个时候，我都喜欢吃些绿色的蔬菜。我的眼睛把那份打得漂漂亮亮的菜单溜了一遍，想找点绿色蔬菜吃。我看到白菜下边，就把椅子弄翻了，叫来了老板。他告诉我，你住在这儿。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sarah recognised the first card she had typewritten that afternoon. There was still the rayed splotch in the upper right-hand corner where a tear had fallen. But over the spot where one should have read the name of the meadow plant, the clinging memory of their golden blossoms had allowed her fingers to strike strange keys.</div>
