<div class="line_en">But she -- was she herself without blemish? Alas, she knew she was not. She was keeping a secret from him, she was acting dishonorably toward him, and many a pang it was costing her. SHE WAS BREAKING THE COMPACT, AND CONCEALING IT FROM HIM. Under strong temptation she had gone into business again; she had risked their whole fortune in a purchase of all the railway systems and coal and steel companies in the country on a margin, and she was now trembling, every Sabbath hour, lest through some chance word of hers he find it out. In her misery and remorse for this treachery she could not keep her heart from going out to him in pity; she was filled with compunctions to see him lying there, drunk and contented, and ever suspecting. Never suspecting -- trusting her with a perfect and pathetic trust, and she holding over him by a thread a possible calamity of so devastating a --</div>

<div class="line_en">One Sunday afternoon some time after this they were sailing the summer seas in their dream yacht, and reclining in lazy luxury under the awning of the after-deck. There was silence, for each was busy with his own thoughts. These seasons of silence had insensibly been growing more and more frequent of late; the old nearness and cordiality were waning. Sally's terrible revelation had done its work; Aleck had tried hard to drive the memory of it out of her mind, but it would not go, and the shame and bitterness of it were poisoning her gracious dream life. She could see now (on Sundays) that her husband was becoming a bloated and repulsive Thing. She could not close her eyes to this, and in these days she no longer looked at him, Sundays, when she could help it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这件事过后不久的一天周日下午，当时他们正乘着梦中的游艇在夏日的海面上扬帆远航，斜倚在后甲板的天篷底下俯懒地享受。俩人默默无语，都在忙着想自己的心事。这些日子以来，这种沉默不知不觉地多了起来，最近更加常见。以往的亲密和至诚正在褪色。萨利那次交心种下了恶果；艾莱柯费了好大劲从脑海里驱走那可怕的记忆，可它就是不走。这种记忆的羞耻和苦涩污染了她温馨的幻想生活。如今她看得出来，她的丈夫（每到周日）就变成了一个放荡不羁、人见人烦的家伙。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The interrupting words brought her suddenly to herself. She was grateful to have that persecuting subject from her thoughts, and she answered, with much of the old-time tenderness in her tone:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="萨利突如其来的一句话一下子惊醒了她。摆脱了这件烦心事，她非常高兴，就用往日那种甜蜜的嗓音答道：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes, dear."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“什么事啊，亲爱的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Do you know, Aleck, I think we are making a mistake -- that is, you are. I mean about the marriage business." He sat up, fat and froggy and benevolent, like a bronze Buddha, and grew earnest. "Consider -- it's more than five years. You've continued the same policy from the start: with every rise, always holding on for five points higher. Always when I think we are going to have some weddings, you see a bigger thing ahead, and I undergo another disappointment. _I_ think you are too hard to please. Some day we'll get left. First, we turned down the dentist and the lawyer. That was all right -- it was sound. Next, we turned down the banker's son and the pork-butcher's heir -- right again, and sound. Next, we turned down the Congressman's son and the Governor's -- right as a trivet, I confess it. Next the Senator's son and the son of the Vice-President of the United States -- perfectly right, there's no permanency about those little distinctions. Then you went for the aristocracy; and I thought we had struck oil at last -- yes. We would make a plunge at the Four Hundred, and pull in some ancient lineage, venerable, holy, ineffable, mellow with the antiquity of a hundred and fifty years, disinfected of the ancestral odors of salt-cod and pelts all of a century ago, and unsmirched by a day's work since, and then! why, then the marriages, of course. But no, along comes a pair a real aristocrats from Europe, and straightway you throw over the half-breeds. It was awfully discouraging, Aleck! Since then, what a procession! You turned down the baronets for a pair of barons; you turned down the barons for a pair of viscounts; the viscounts for a pair of earls; the earls for a pair of marquises; the marquises for a brace of dukes. NOW, Aleck, cash in! -- you've played the limit. You've got a job lot of four dukes under the hammer; of four nationalities; all sound in the wind and limb and pedigree, all bankrupt and in debt up to the ears. They come high, but we can afford it. Come, Aleck, don't delay any longer, don't keep up the suspense: take the whole lay-out, and leave the girls to choose!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你知道吗，艾莱柯，我觉得咱们犯了个错误——这可是你的错。我是说那件婚姻大事。”他坐了起来，肥肥的青蛙肚，慈眉善目，活像一尊铜佛；他的口气郑重起来了。“想想吧——五年多了。你还守着老规矩，一成不变：只要赚一笔，择婿的档次就提高一档。每到我琢磨着要举行婚礼的时候，你的眼光又高了，让我一回回地失望。我觉得你也太难伺候了。总有一天咱们得落个高不成低不就。头一次，咱们把牙医和律师甩了。也罢——甩得有道理。接着咱们甩了银行老板和猪肉批发商的儿子。这也由他去——甩得有道理。再往后，咱们又没看上众议员和州长家的公子——我承认这也没有什么不妥。接下来是参议员和合众国副总统的公子——做得很对，这种芝麻官做不长远。后来你就瞄上贵族了；我记得当时咱们家的油田终于见油了——对。咱们要在四百家大户里面蓖一遍，网罗一些门第显赫、出身不凡的世家贵胄，这些血统纯正的家族历经一百五十年，具备大家风范，一百年前就除去了祖先身上的咸鱼和老羊皮袄的气味，从那以后就再也没有做过一天苦工，两手清清爽爽。到时候了！该举行婚礼了吧？当然。可是不成，从欧洲来了两个货真价实的贵族，你马上让煮了半熟的鸭子飞了。艾莱柯，这可太让人扫兴了！从那以后，又是长长的一队2你甩了两个二等男爵，换成两个男爵；甩了这两个男爵，又换成了两个子爵；子爵换成伯爵；伯爵换成侯爵；侯爵再换成公爵。艾莱柯，现在该兑现了吧！——这把牌你已经打到头了。你把四个公爵放在手里挑三拣四。他们的国籍各不相同；个个都美名远扬，血统纯正，谱系清楚；个个都破了产，背了一屁股债。他们要价不低，可咱们能出得起呀。好了，艾莱柯，别再拖了，别再犹豫不决了：把一副牌都摆开，让姑娘们自个儿挑吧！”">查看中文翻译</div>

There isn't much land in the principality, but there's enough: eight hundred acres in the graveyard and forty-two outside. It's a SOVEREIGNTY -- that's the main thing; LAND'S nothing.
