<div class="line_en">After old sunny was gone, I sat in the chair for a while and smoked a couple of cigarettes. It was getting daylight outside. Boy, I felt miserable. I felt so depressed, you can't imagine. What I did, I started talking, sort of out loud, to Allie. I do that sometimes when I get very depressed. I keep telling him to go home and get his bike and meet me in front of Bobby Fallon's house. Bobby Fallon used to live quite near us in Maine -- this is, years ago. Anyway, what happened was, one day Bobby and I were going over to Lake Sedebego on our bikes. We were going to take our lunches and all, and our BB guns -- we were kids and all, and we thought we could shoot something with our BB guns. Anyway, Allie heard us talking about it, and he wanted to go, and I wouldn't let him. I told him he was a child. So once in a while, now, when I get very depressed, I keep saying to him, "Okay. Go home and get your bike and meet me in front of Bobby's house. Hurry up." It wasn't that I didn't use to take him with me when I went somewhere. I did. But that one day, I didn't. He didn't get sore about it -- he never got sore about anything -- but I keep thinking about it anyway, when I get very depressed.</div>

<div class="line_en">Finally, though, I got undressed and got in bed. I felt like praying or something, when I was in bed, but I couldn't do it. I can't always pray when I feel like it. In the first place, I'm sort of an atheist. I like Jesus and all, but I don't care too much for most of the other stuff in the Bible. Take the Disciples, for instance. They annoy the hell out of me, if you want to know the truth. They were all right after Jesus was dead and all, but while He was alive, they were about as much use to Him as a hole in the head. All they did was keep letting Him down. I like almost anybody in the Bible better than the Disciples. If you want to know the truth, the guy I like best in the Bible, next to Jesus, was that lunatic and all, that lived in the tombs and kept cutting himself with stones. I like him ten times as much as the Disciples, that poor bastard. I used to get in quite a few arguments about it, when I was at Whooton School, with this boy that lived down the corridor, Arthur Childs. Old Childs was a Quaker and all, and he read the Bible all the time. He was a very nice kid, and I liked him, but I could never see eye to eye with him on a lot of stuff in the Bible, especially the Disciples. He kept telling me if I didn't like the Disciples, then I didn't like Jesus and all. He said that because Jesus picked the Disciples, you were supposed to like them. I said I knew He picked them, but that He picked them at random. I said He didn't have time to go around analyzing everybody. I said I wasn't blaming Jesus or anything. It wasn't His fault that He didn't have any time. I remember I asked old Childs if he thought Judas, the one that betrayed Jesus and all, went to Hell after he committed suicide. Childs said certainly. That's exactly where I disagreed with him. I said I'd bet a thousand bucks that Jesus never sent old Judas to Hell. I still would, too, if I had a thousand bucks. I think any one of the Disciples would've sent him to Hell and all -- and fast, too -- but I'll bet anything Jesus didn't do it. Old Childs said the trouble with me was that I didn't go to church or anything. He was right about that, in a way. I don't. In the first place, my parents are different religions, and all the children in our family are atheists. If you want to know the truth, I can't even stand ministers. The ones they've had at every school I've gone to, they all have these Holy Joe voices when they start giving their sermons. God, I hate that. I don't see why the hell they can't talk in their natural voice. They sound so phony when they talk.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后，我脱掉衣服上床了。上床以后，我倒是想祷告什么的，可我祷告不出来。我真想祷告的时候，却往往祷告不出来。主要原因是我不信教。我喜欢耶酥什么的，可我对《圣经》里其他那些玩艺儿多半不感兴趣。就拿十二门徒来说吧，他们都叫我腻烦得要命，我老实告诉你说。耶稣死后，他们倒是挺不错，可耶稣活着的时候，他们起的作用，简直等于是在他的脑袋里打了个窟窿眼儿。他们只会泄他的气。在我看来《圣经》里的任何人物都要比十二门徒强。你如果要我说老实话，《圣经》里除了耶稣以外，我最最喜欢的要数那个疯子，就是住在坟墓里不断地拿石头砍自己的那个。这个可怜的杂种，我喜欢他要胜过那些门徒十倍。我在胡敦中学的时候，常常为这事跟住在走廊尽头那个叫作亚瑟．查尔兹的家伙争论个没完。老查尔兹是个教友会信徒，一天到晚在读《圣经》。他是个很不错的孩子，我很喜欢他，不过关于《圣经》里的许多事物，我始终没法跟他取得一致看法，尤其是那些门徒。他口口声声跟我说，我要是不喜欢那些门徒，也就是不喜欢耶稣本人。他说，既然是耶稣选择了那些门徒，你就应该喜欢他们。我说，我也知道是他选择了他们，不过他只是随便挑选的。我说，他没时间对每个人作仔细分析。我说，我毫无责备耶稣的意思。他之所以没时间，那也不能怪他。我记得我还问过老查尔兹，那个出卖耶酥的犹大自杀以后是不是进了地狱。查尔兹说当然啦。我就是在这一点上不能同意他的意见。我说，我可以跟他赌一千块钱，耶稣并没有将犹大打入地狱。我现在依旧愿意跟人打这个赌，只要我有一千块钱。我觉得任何一个门徒都会把犹大打入地狱――而且打得极快――不过我可以拿随便什么东西打赌，耶稣决不会这样做。老查尔兹说，我的问题在于从来不上教堂。他这话说的倒是有些对。我的确从来不上教堂。主要是，我父母信不同的教，家里的孩子也就什么教也不信了。你如果要我说实话，我可以老实告诉你说我甚至受不了那些牧师。就拿我念书的那些学校里的牧师来说吧，他们布道的时候，总装出那么一副神圣的嗓音。天哪，我真讨厌这个。我真他妈的看不出他们为什么不能用原来的嗓音讲道。她们一讲起道来，听去总是那么假。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But I'm crazy. I swear to God I am. About halfway to the bathroom, I sort of started pretending I had a bullet in my guts. Old Maurice had plugged me. Now I was on the way to the bathroom to get a good shot of bourbon or something to steady my nerves and help me really go into action. I pictured myself coming out of the goddam bathroom, dressed and all, with my automatic in my pocket, and staggering around a little bit. Then I'd walk downstairs, instead of using the elevator. I'd hold onto the banister and all, with this blood trickling out of the side of my mouth a little at a time. What I'd do, I'd walk down a few floors -- holding onto my guts, blood leaking all over the place -- and then I'd ring the elevator bell. As soon as old Maurice opened the doors, he'd see me with the automatic in my hand and he'd start screaming at me, in this very high-pitched, yellow-belly voice, to leave him alone. But I'd plug him anyway. Six shots right through his fat hairy belly. Then I'd throw my automatic down the elevator shaft -- after I'd wiped off all the finger prints and all. Then I'd crawl back to my room and call up Jane and have her come over and bandage up my guts. I pictured her holding a cigarette for me to smoke while I was bleeding and all.</div>

<div class="line_en">I wasn't knocked out or anything, though, because I remember looking up from the floor and seeing them both go out the door and shut it. Then I stayed on the floor a fairly long time, sort of the way I did with Stradlater. Only, this time I thought I was dying. I really did. I thought I was drowning or something. The trouble was, I could hardly breathe. When I did finally get up, I had to walk to the bathroom all doubled up and holding onto my stomach and all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我并没给打昏过去，因为我还记得自己怎样从地板上目送他们两个一起走出房间，还随手把门带上。我在地板上躺了好一会儿，就象我跟斯特拉德莱塔打架时那样。只是，这一次我以为自己快要死了。我真的这样以为。我觉得自己好象掉在水里快要淹死似的。问题是，我的呼吸十分困难。最后我好容易站起来，得弯着腰捧着肚子向浴室走去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then I got back in bed. It took me quite a while to get to sleep -- I wasn't even tired -- but finally I did. What I really felt like, though, was committing suicide. I felt like jumping out the window. I probably would've done it, too, if I'd been sure somebody'd cover me up as soon as I landed. I didn't want a bunch of stupid rubbernecks looking at me when I was all gory.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="随后我回到床上。我过了好一会儿才睡着――我甚至不觉得困――可我终于睡着了。我当时倒是真想自杀。我很想从窗口跳出去。我可能也真会那样做，要是我确实知道我一律到地上马上就会有人拿布把我盖起来。我不希望自己浑身是血的时候有一嘟噜傻瓜蛋伸长脖子看着我。">查看中文翻译</div>
