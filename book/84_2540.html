<div class="line_en">At least, that's what I was told. I never saw them. As Grandpa got older he ranched less and farmed more, until one day he stopped farming. He had no need for horses, so he sold the ones that had value and set the rest loose. They multiplied, and by the time I was born there was a whole herd of wild horses on the mountain.</div>

<div class="line_en">Richard called them dog-food horses. Once a year, Luke, Richard and I would help Grandpa round up a dozen or so to take to the auction in town, where they'd be sold for slaughter. Some years Grandpa would look out over the small, frightened herd bound for the meat grinder, at the young stallions pacing, coming to terms with their first captivity, and a hunger would appear in his eyes. Then he'd point to one and say, "Don't load that 'un. That 'un we'll break."</div>

<div class="line_en">We tried not to name them, these beasts we hoped to tame, but we had to refer to them somehow. The names we chose were descriptive, not sentimental: Big Red, Black Mare, White Giant. I was thrown from dozens of these horses as they bucked, reared, rolled or leapt. I hit the dirt in a hundred sprawling postures, each time righting myself in an instant and skittering to the safety of a tree, tractor or fence, in case the horse was feeling vengeful.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们尽量不给那些要被驯服的野兽起名字，但我们总得用某种方式提及它们。我们选择的都是具有描述性、不带情感色彩的名字：大红、黑母马、白巨人。这些马在弓背跃起、扬起前腿直立、翻滚或跳跃时，有十几次把我从它们身上甩了下来。我以百种姿势四仰八叉摔倒在地，每次都立刻爬起来，飞快地跑到安全的树上、拖拉机上或篱笆上，以防这些马报复。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But feral horses don't yield easily, not even to a man like Grandpa. My brothers and I would spend days, even weeks, earning the horse's trust, just so we could touch it. Then we would stroke its long face and gradually, over more weeks, work our hands around its wide neck and down its muscular body. After a month of this we'd bring out the saddle, and the horse would toss its head suddenly and with such violence that the halter would snap or the rope break. Once a large copper stallion busted the corral fence, smashed through it as if it weren't there, and came out the other side bloody and bruised.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但野马不易驯服，即使对爷爷这样的人来说也是如此。我和哥哥们会花几天甚至几周时间先赢得这匹马的信任，这样我们才能碰它。接着我们轻抚它的长脸，循序渐进，再过几周用手环住它宽大的脖子和肌肉发达的身体。这样过了一个月，我们便拿来马鞍。马会突然把头一扬，用力之猛差点折断笼头或挣断缰绳。有一次，一匹古铜色的大种马当畜栏不存在一样将它撞穿，然后自己从另一头钻出来，浑身是血，伤痕累累。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We never triumphed; our strength of will faltered long before theirs. We got some so they wouldn't buck when they saw the saddle, and a few who'd tolerate a human on their back for jaunts around the corral, but not even Grandpa dared ride them on the mountain. Their natures hadn't changed. They were pitiless, powerful avatars from another world. To mount them was to surrender your footing, to move into their domain. To risk being borne away.</div>

<div class="line_en">I refused to name the horse, so we called him the Yearling. The Yearling was already broke to a halter and lead, so Shawn brought out the saddle that first day. The Yearling pawed the dirt nervously when he saw it; Shawn moved slowly, letting him smell the stirrups and nibble curiously at the horn. Then Shawn rubbed the smooth leather across his broad chest, moving steadily but without hurry.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我不想给这匹马起名字，所以我们只是叫他“一岁”。“一岁”已经接受了缰绳和笼头，于是肖恩第一次拿出了马鞍。“一岁”看到马鞍便紧张地用蹄子刨土；肖恩慢慢走近，让他好奇地闻闻马镫，咬咬鞍头。接着肖恩摩挲他宽阔的胸膛上光滑的皮毛，动作平稳，不慌不忙。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">An hour later the saddle was cinched. Shawn said it was time to mount, and I climbed onto the barn roof, sure the corral would descend into violence. But when Shawn hoisted himself into the saddle, the Yearling merely skittered. His front hooves raised a few inches off the dirt, as if he'd pondered rearing but thought better of it, then he dropped his head and his paws stilled. In the space of a moment, he had accepted our claim to ride him, to his being ridden. He had accepted the world as it was, in which he was an owned thing. He had never been feral, so he could not hear the maddening call of that other world, on the mountain, in which he could not be owned, could not be ridden.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一个小时后，马鞍被套紧了。肖恩说可以上马了，而我爬上谷仓屋顶，确信畜栏会被撞碎。但肖恩爬上马鞍时，“一岁”仅仅跳了一下。他微微抬起前蹄离地几英寸，像是打算扬起前腿直立起来，但想想还是算了，于是又低下头，放下了蹄子。不一会儿，他就接受了我们要骑他的要求，接受了自己被骑的命运。他接受了这个世界的本来面目，在其中，他是别人的所属物。他从没有过野性，所以听不到来自另一个世界大山的狂野召唤——在那里，他既不能被拥有，也不能被人骑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I did not. I was terrified of horses, or I was terrified of what I thought horses were -- that is, thousand-pound devils whose ambition was to dash brains against rock. I told Shawn he could break the horse. I would watch from the fence.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Horses don't like things where they can't see 'em," Shawn said. "Best to get him used to the saddle in front. Then when he's real comfortable with it, with the way it smells and feels, we can move it around back."</div>

<div class="line_en">Shawn said he wanted out of his old life, and that the first step was to stay away from his friends. Suddenly he was home every evening, looking for something to do. He began to drive me to my rehearsals at Worm Creek. When it was just the two of us floating down the highway, he was mellow, lighthearted. He joked and teased, and he sometimes gave me advice, which was mostly "Don't do what I did." But when we arrived at the theater, he would change.</div>

<div class="line_en">I named him Bud. Every night for a week I watched Shawn and Bud gallop through the corral in the gray haze of dusk. Then, on a soft summer evening, I stood next to Bud, grasping the reins while Shawn held the halter steady, and stepped into the saddle.</div>

<div class="line_en">At first he watched the younger boys with wary concentration, then he began to bait them. It wasn't obvious aggression, just small provocations. He might flick off a boy's hat or knock a soda can from his hand and laugh as the stain spread over the boy's jeans. If he was challenged -- and he usually wasn't -- he would play the part of the ruffian, a hardened "Whatcha gonna do about it?" expression disguising his face. But after, when it was just the two of us, the mask lowered, the bravado peeled off like a breastplate, and he was my brother.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="起初他只是警惕地盯着那些比他小的男孩，不久就开始找他们的茬。不是故意欺负，只是小小的挑衅。他会把一个男孩的帽子弹掉，或者将对方手中的汽水罐打翻，对着蔓延在男孩牛仔裤上的污渍哈哈大笑。如果有人对他提出挑战——通常不会有人这么做——他会表现出一副流氓相，一副“看你有种”的冷酷模样。但之后，只有我们俩时，他的面具卸掉了，那种虚张声势就像胸甲一样脱落，他还是我的哥哥。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was his smile I loved best. His upper canines had never grown in, and the string of holistic dentists my parents had taken him to as a child had failed to notice until it was too late. By the time he was twenty-three, and he got himself to an oral surgeon, they had rotated sideways inside his gums and were ejecting themselves through the tissue under his nose. The surgeon who removed them told Shawn to preserve his baby teeth for as long as possible, then when they rotted out, he'd be given posts. But they never rotted out. They stayed, stubborn relics of a misplaced childhood, reminding anyone who witnessed his pointless, endless, feckless belligerence, that this man was once a boy.</div>

After breaking Bud that spring, Shawn had taken up horses in a serious way. All summer he'd been buying horses, Thoroughbreds and Paso Finos, most of them unbroken because he could pick them up cheap. We were still working with Bud. We'd taken him on a dozen rides through the open pasture, but he was inexperienced, skittish, unpredictable.</div>

<div class="line_en">That evening, Shawn saddled a new horse, a copper-coated mare, for the first time. She was ready for a short ride, Shawn said, so we mounted, him on the mare, me on Bud. We made it about half a mile up the mountain, moving deliberately so as not to frighten the horses, winding our way through the wheat fields. Then I did something foolish. I got too close to the mare. She didn't like having the gelding behind her, and with no warning she leapt forward, thrusting her weight onto her front legs, and with her hind legs kicked Bud full in the chest.</div>

<div class="line_en">Shawn couldn't help me, not on that unbroken mare. Hysteria in one horse causes hysteria in others, especially in the young and spirited. Of all Shawn's horses, there was only one -- a seven-year-old buckskin named Apollo -- who might have been old enough, and calm enough, to do it: to explode in furious speed, a nostril-flapping gallop, then coolly navigate while the rider detached his body, lifting one leg out of the stirrup and reaching to the ground to catch the reins of another horse wild with fright.

The mare wouldn't even understand the command when he shouted, "Giddy-yap!"; at the jab of his boot in her gut, which she'd never felt before, she would rear, twisting wildly. But he would yank her head down, and as soon as her hooves touched the dirt, kick her a second time, harder, knowing she would rear again. He would do this until she leapt into a run, then he would drive her forward, welcoming her wild acceleration, somehow guiding her even though she'd not yet learned the strange dance of movements that, over time, becomes a kind of language between horse and rider. All this would happen in seconds, a year of training reduced to a single, desperate moment.</div>

<div class="line_en">I was so disoriented that I felt, rather than saw, the powerful penny-toned mare moving into place beside me. Shawn lifted his body from the saddle and tilted himself toward the ground, holding his reins tightly in one hand while, with the other, he snatched Bud's reins from the weeds. The leather straps pulled taut; the bit forced Bud's head up and forward. With his head raised, Bud could no longer buck and he entered a smooth, rhythmic gallop. Shawn yanked hard on his own reins, pulling the mare's head toward his knee, forcing her to run in a circle. He pulled her head tighter on every pass, wrapping the strap around his forearm, shrinking the circle until it was so small, the pounding hooves stood still. I slid from the saddle and lay in the wheat, the itchy stalks poking through my shirt. Above my head the horses panted, their bellies swelling and collapsing, their hooves pawing at the dirt.</div>
