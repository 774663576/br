<div class="line_en">I hope you want to know what became of the other boys. They were waiting below to give Wendy time to explain about them; and when they had counted five hundred they went up. They went up by the stair, because they thought this would make a better impression. They stood in a row in front of Mrs. Darling, with their hats off, and wishing they were not wearing their pirate clothes. They said nothing, but their eyes asked her to have them. They ought to have looked at Mr. Darling also, but they forgot about him.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh, all right," Peter said, as if he had asked her from politeness merely; but Mrs. Darling saw his mouth twitch, and she made this handsome offer: to let Wendy go to him for a week every year to do his spring cleaning. Wendy would have preferred a more permanent arrangement; and it seemed to her that spring would be long in coming; but this promise sent Peter away quite gay again. He had no sense of time, and was so full of adventures that all I have told you about him is only of halfpenny-worth of them. I suppose it was because Wendy knew this that her last words to him were these rather plaintive ones:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那就拉倒吧。”彼得说，好像他邀请温迪去只是出于礼貌。但是，达林太太看到彼得的嘴抽动了，于是她提出一个慷慨的建议：每年让温迪去他那儿住上一个礼拜，帮他搞春季的大扫除。温迪宁愿有一个更长远的安排，而且她觉得，春天要等很久才到来。但是，这个许诺却使彼得高高兴兴地走了。他没有时间观念，他有那么多冒险的事要做，我告诉你们的，只不过是其中微乎其微的一点点。我想，大概温迪深知这一点，所以，她最后向他说了一句这样悲伤的话：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Michael believed longer than the other boys, though they jeered at him; so he was with Wendy when Peter came for her at the end of the first year. She flew away with Peter in the frock she had woven from leaves and berries in the Neverland, and her one fear was that he might notice how short it had become; but he never noticed, he had so much to say about himself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈克尔比别的孩子相信得时间长些，虽然他们老是讥笑他；所以，第一年末彼得来找温迪时，他还和温迪在一起。温迪和彼得一起飞走时，身上穿着她在永无岛时，用树叶和浆果编织成的罩褂，她生怕彼得看出这罩褂已经变得多么短了；可是彼得根本没注意，他自己的事，他还说不完呢。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Of course all the boys went to school; and most of them got into Class III, but Slightly was put first into Class IV and then into Class V. Class I is the top class. Before they had attended school a week they saw what goats they had been not to remain on the island; but is was too late now, and soon they settled down to being as ordinary as you or me or Jenkins minor (the younger Jenkins). It is sad to have to say that the power to fly gradually left them. At first Nana tied their feet to the bed-posts so that they should not fly away in the night; and one of their diversions by day was to pretend to fall off buses (the English double-deckers); but by and by they ceased to tug at their bonds in bed, and found that they hurt themselves when the let go to the bus. In time they could not even fly after their hats. Want of practice, they called it; but what it really was that they no longer believed.</div>

Wendy was grown up. You need not be sorry for her. She was one of the kind that likes to grow up. In the end she grew up of her own free will a day quicker than other girls.</div>

<div class="line_en">Years rolled on again, and Wendy had a daughter. This ought not to be written in ink but in a golden splash.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="岁月如流水，温迪有了一个女儿。这件事不该用墨水写下，而应用金粉大书特书。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Wendy was married in white with a pink sash. It is strange to think that Peter did not alight in the church and forbid the banns (formal announcement of a marriage).</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="温迪结婚时，穿着一件白衣，系着一条粉红饰带。想来也挺奇怪，彼得竟没有飞进教堂，去反对这桩婚礼。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She was called Jane, and always had an odd inquiring look, as of from the moment she arrived on the mainland she wanted to ask questions. When she was old enough to ask them they were mostly about Peter Pan. She loved to hear of Peter, and Wendy told her all she could remember in the very nursery from which the famous flight had taken place. It was Jane's nursery now, for her father had bought it at the three per cents. (mortgage rate) from Wendy's father, who was no longer fond of stairs. Mrs. Darling was now dead and forgotten.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="女儿名叫简，她总带着一种好发问的古怪神情，仿佛她一来到世上，就有许多问题要问。等她长到可以发问的时候，她的问题多半是关于彼得的。她爱听彼得的事，温迪把她自己所能记得起的事情全讲给女儿听。她讲这些故事的地点，正是那间发生过那次有名的飞行的育儿室。现在，这里成了简的育儿室；因为，她父亲以百分之三的廉价从温迪的父亲手里买下了这房子。温迪的父亲已经不喜欢爬楼梯了。达林太太已经去世，被遗忘了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There were only two beds in the nursery now, Jane's and her nurse's; and there was no kennel, for Nana also had passed away. She died of old age, and at the end she had been rather difficult to get on with; being very firmly convinced that no one knew how to look after children except herself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在育儿室里只有两张床了，简的床和她的保姆的床，狗舍已经没有了，因为娜娜也死了。她是老死的，最后几年，她的脾气变得很难相处；因为她非常固执己见，认为除了她，谁也不懂得怎样看孩子。">查看中文翻译</div>
