<div class="line_en">After Nathan had left I would programme the radio or television for Will, dispense his pills, sometimes crushing them with the little marble pestle and mortar. Usually, after ten minutes or so he would make it clear that he was weary of my presence. At this point I would eke out the little annexe's domestic tasks, washing tea towels that weren't dirty, or using random vacuum attachments to clean tiny bits of skirting or window sill, religiously popping my head round the door every fifteen minutes as Mrs Traynor had instructed. When I did, he would be sitting in his chair looking out into the bleak garden.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="内森离开后我会为威尔打开收音机或是电视机，配好药，有时用小杵臼把药捣碎。通常，大约十分钟后，他会表明他讨厌我在旁边。这时我会干点配楼的家务活儿，洗没有脏的茶巾，用吸尘器的任意附加装置清洁小块壁脚板或者窗台，按照特雷纳夫人的吩咐，每十五分钟就虔诚地到门口转一转。每次我过去时，他都坐在轮椅里看着荒凉的花园。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Two weeks passed and with them emerged a routine of sorts. Every morning I would arrive at Granta House at eight, call out that I was there and then, after Nathan had finished helping Will dress, listen carefully while he told me what I needed to know about Will's meds -- or, more importantly, his mood.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两个星期过去了，我也摸索出了一套日常的程序。每天早上我八点钟到达格兰塔屋，告诉他们我到了。等内森帮威尔穿好衣服后，我会仔细倾听他告诉我关于威尔用药的相关情况——更重要的是他的心情，还有我需要注意些什么。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Later I might take him a drink of water, or one of the calorie-filled drinks that were supposed to keep his weight up and looked like pastel-coloured wallpaper paste, or give him his food. He could move his hands a little, but not his arm, so he had to be fed forkful by forkful. This was the worst part of the day; it seemed wrong, somehow, spoon-feeding a grown man, and my embarrassment made me clumsy and awkward. Will hated it so much he wouldn't even meet my eye while I was doing it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="稍后我会给他端去一杯水，抑或一种富含卡路里的饮料，看上去像是彩色墙纸糊，据说会让他增重，还会给他送去食物。他的手能动一下下，胳膊不行，所以要一勺一勺地喂他。这是一天中最困难的时候之一：喂一个成人吃饭让人觉得怪怪的，困窘让我笨手笨脚。威尔很讨厌这一点，我每次喂他时，他都不正视我。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In the afternoon I would put a film on -- Will had a membership of a DVD club and new films arrived by post every day -- but he never invited me to watch with him, so I'd usually go and sit in the kitchen or in the spare room. I started bringing in a book or magazine, but I felt oddly guilty not actually working, and I could never quite concentrate on the words. Occasionally, at the end of the day, Mrs Traynor would pop in -- although she never said much to me, other than "Everything all right?" to which the only acceptable answer seemed to be "Yes".</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="下午我会放一部电影——威尔是一个DVD俱乐部的会员，每天都有新的电影光碟寄来——但是他从未邀请我跟他一起看，我常到厨房或备用卧室坐一会儿。我开始带上一本书或一本杂志，但是没有真正在干活让我感到一种怪异的愧疚，我也就没能把注意力完全集中到那些文字上。偶尔，一天结束的时候，特雷纳夫人会过来——她很少跟我说话，除了寻问“一切都好吗”。这个问题唯一可接受的答案似乎是“是的”。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She would ask Will if he wanted anything, occasionally suggest something he might like to do tomorrow -- some outing, or some friend who had asked after him -- and he would almost always answer dismissively, if not with downright rudeness. She would look pained, run her fingers up and down that little gold chain, and disappear again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她会问威尔要不要什么，问他明天要不要做些什么事——出去走走，探望某个问候过他的朋友——他几乎总是爱搭不理，如果不是无礼透顶的话。她看上去会很受伤，手指在那条细金链上来来回回触摸，然后再次消失。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And then shortly before one, Nathan would arrive and I would grab my coat and disappear to walk the streets, sometimes eating my lunch in the bus shelter outside the castle. It was cold and I probably looked pathetic perched there eating my sandwiches, but I didn't care. I couldn't spend a whole day in that house.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="快到一点的时候，内森会来。我会抓起大衣消失，到大街上漫步，有时在城堡外的公共汽车候车亭吃午餐。那儿很冷，我待在那儿吃三明治，看上去或许很可怜，不过我不在乎。我可不想在那所房子里待上一整天。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">His father, a well-padded, gentle-looking man, usually came in as I was leaving. He was the kind of man you might see watching cricket in a Panama hat, and had apparently overseen the management of the castle since retiring from his well-paid job in the city. I suspected this was like a benign landowner digging in the odd potato just "to keep his hand in". He finished every day at 5pm promptly and would sit and watch television with Will. Sometimes I heard him making some remark about whatever was on the news as I left.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的父亲，一个肩宽体胖、绅士模样的人，总是在我要离开时来。他是你看到过的那种戴顶巴拿马草帽看板球的人，自从从报酬丰厚的工作岗位上退休，他就在管理城堡。我猜想那就像一个仁慈的地主为了“不让手生疏”而努力挖掘剩余的土豆。他每天下午五点准时下班，会坐下来和威尔一起看电视。新闻中的任何内容他都会评论一番，我离开时有时会听到。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I got to study Will Traynor up close, in those first couple of weeks. I saw that he seemed determined not to look anything like the man he had been; he had let his light-brown hair grow into a shapeless mess, his stubble crawl across his jaw. His grey eyes were lined with exhaustion, or the effect of constant discomfort (Nathan said he was rarely comfortable). They bore the hollow look of someone who was always a few steps removed from the world around him. Sometimes I wondered if it was a defence mechanism, whether the only way to cope with his life was to pretend it wasn't him it was happening to.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在最初的这两个星期，我仔细研究起威尔•特雷纳来。我看出他决心要成为一个与以前截然不同的人；他让浅棕色的头发长成一团糟，胡楂蔓延到下巴。他那对灰色的眼睛充满疲倦，或是永远的不舒适（内森说他很少自在过）。他老是一副空虚呆滞的神情，好像总是游离于他身边的世界。有时我思量这是一种防御机制，或许让他好过一点的唯一方法就是假装事情并未发生在他身上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I wanted to feel sorry for him. I really did. I thought he was the saddest person I had ever met, in those moments when I glimpsed him staring out of the window. And as the days went by and I realized that his condition was not just a matter of being stuck in that chair, of the loss of physical freedom, but a never-ending litany of indignities and health problems, of risks and discomforts, I decided that if I were Will, I would probably be pretty miserable too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我同情他，我确实表现出了这一点。当我瞥见他盯着窗外时，我觉得他是我见过的最伤感的人。随着日子一天天过去，我意识到他的问题不仅仅是被困在轮椅中，不仅仅是失去身体上的行动自由，还有一种反反复复永无止境的羞辱和健康问题，是一系列的危险和不便。要是我是威尔，我也会相当可怜。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But oh Lord, he was vile to me. Everything I said, he had a sharp answer for. If I asked him if he was warm enough, he would retort that he was quite capable of letting me know if he needed another blanket. If I asked if the vacuum cleaner was too noisy for him -- I hadn't wanted to interrupt his film -- he asked me why, had I worked out a way to make it run silently? When I fed him, he complained that the food was too hot or too cold, or that I had brought the next forkful up to his mouth before he had finished the last. He had the ability to twist almost anything I said or did so that I seemed stupid.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是天哪，他对我坏透了。不管我说什么，他的回答都很尖锐。如果我问他是否够暖和，他会反驳说要是他还需要一条毛毯他完全有能力让我知道。如果我问吸尘器有没有吵到他——我不想打扰他看电影——他会问我，难道我有什么办法让吸尘器吸尘时不出声？我喂他吃饭时，他抱怨食物要么太热要么太凉，抱怨他上一口还没有吃完，我就喂他下一口。他有能力曲解我说的任何话、做的任何事，他让我觉得自己简直蠢到了家。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I hadn't realized it was possible to miss my old job more than I already did. I missed Frank, and the way he actually looked pleased to see me when I arrived in the morning. I missed the customers, their company, and the easy chatter that swelled and dipped gently like a benign sea around me. This house, beautiful and expensive as it was, was as still and silent as a morgue. Six months, I repeated under my breath, when it felt unbearable. Six months.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我没想到我会如此怀念我的前一份工作。我想念弗兰克，想念早上他看到我到达店里时那副高兴的神情。我想念那些顾客，那伙人轻松的聊天像温和的海水在我身边起起伏伏。这间房子，漂亮奢华，却像死水一样寂静无波。六个月，当我难以忍受时我会低声重复，六个月。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">During those first two weeks, I got quite good at keeping my face completely blank, and I would turn away and disappear into the other room and just say as little to him as I possibly could. I started to hate him, and I'm sure he knew it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在这两个星期里，我已经学会了面无表情，我会转身去另一个房间，尽可能少地跟他说话。我有些恨他，我确信他知道这一点。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And then on the Thursday, just as I was mixing Will's mid-morning, high-calorie drink, I heard Mrs Traynor's voice in the hall. Except this time there were other voices too.

<div class="line_cn" title="之后的周四那天，我正在调制威尔上午喝的高热量饮料时，听见从大厅传来特雷纳夫人的声音，还有其他人的声音。我手拿着叉子听着，我能听出一个谈吐优雅的年轻女人的声音，以及一个男人的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Mrs Traynor said you might like some coffee," I said as I entered, placing the tray on the low table. As I placed Will's beaker in the holder of his chair, turning the straw so that he only needed to adjust his head position to reach it, I sneaked a look at his visitors.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“特雷纳夫人说你们兴许会想喝点咖啡。”进门时我说道，然后把托盘放在矮桌上。我把威尔的杯子放在他轮椅的托座上，转动麦秆以便威尔只需调整头的位置就能够到，趁此机会我偷偷看了一眼他的访客。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I hesitated a moment before I opened the door, leaning against it with my hip so that I could balance the tray in my hands.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was the woman I noticed first. Long-legged and blonde-haired, with pale caramel skin, she was the kind of woman who makes me wonder if humans really are all the same species. She looked like a human racehorse. I had seen these women occasionally; they were usually bouncing up the hill to the castle, clutching small Boden-clad children, and when they came into the cafe their voices would carry, crystal clear and unselfconscious, as they asked, "Harry, darling, would you like a coffee? Shall I see if they can do you a macchiato?" This was definitely a macchiato woman. Everything about her smelt of money, of entitlement and a life lived as if through the pages of a glossy magazine.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我最先注意的是那个女人。长腿金发，浅褐色的皮肤，她让我怀疑人类是否真是同属一类。她是人类中的赛马。我偶尔会遇见这样的女人：她们常常从山上奔向城堡，手里牵着穿博登牌衣服的小孩，她们进到茶馆来时，声音清晰自然，让人深为动容，问道：“哈里，亲爱的，你要不要来一杯咖啡？让我看看他们能不能给你来一杯焦糖玛奇朵？”这无疑是一个焦糖玛奇朵女人。她身上充满金钱和权力的味道，她的生活是时尚杂志中的章节。">查看中文翻译</div>
