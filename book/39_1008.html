<div class="line_en">I remember the two of us walking through Lake Elizabeth Park in Fremont, a few streets down from our apartment, and watching boys at batting practice, little girls giggling on the swings in the playground. Baba would enlighten me with his politics during those walks with long-winded dissertations. "There are only three real men in this world, Amir," he'd say. He'd count them off on his fingers: America the brash savior, Britain, and Israel. "The rest of them --" he used to wave his hand and make a phht sound "-- they're like gossiping old women."</div>

<div class="line_en">The bit about Israel used to draw the ire of Afghans in Fremont who accused him of being pro-Jewish and, defacto, anti Islam. Baba would meet them for tea and rowt cake at the park, drive them crazy with his politics. "What they don't understand," he'd tell me later, "is that religion has nothing to do with it." In Baba's view, Israel was an island of "real men" in a sea of Arabs too busy getting fat off their oil to care for their own. "Israel does this, Israel does that," Baba would say in a mock-Arabic accent. "Then do something about it! Take action. You're Arabs, help the Palestinians, then!"</div>

<div class="line_en">He loathed Jimmy Carter, whom he called a "big-toothed cretin." In 1980, when we were still in Kabul, the U. S. announced it would be boycotting the Olympic Games in Moscow. "Wah wah!" Baba exclaimed with disgust. "Brezhnev is massacring Afghans and all that peanut eater can say is I won't come swim in your pool." Baba believed Carter had unwittingly done more for communism than Leonid Brezhnev. "He's not fit to run this country. It's like putting a boy who can't ride a bike behind the wheel of a brand new Cadillac." What America and the world needed was a hard man. A man to be reckoned with, someone who took action instead of wringing his hands. That someone came in the form of Ronald Reagan. And when Reagan went on TV and called the Shorawi "the Evil Empire," Baba went out and bought a picture of the grinning president giving a thumbs up. He framed the picture and hung it in our hallway, nailing it right next to the old black-and-white of himself in his thin necktie shaking hands with King Zahir Shah. Most of our neighbors in Fremont were bus drivers, policemen, gas station attendants, and unwed mothers collecting welfare, exactly the sort of blue-collar people who would soon suffocate under the pillow Reganomics pressed to their faces. Baba was the lone Republican in our building.</div>

<div class="line_en">One Sunday in the spring of 1983, I walked into a small bookstore that sold used paperbacks, next to the Indian movie theater just west of where Amtrak crossed Fremont Boulevard. I told Baba I'd be out in five minutes and he shrugged. He had been working at a gas station in Fremont and had the day off. I watched him jaywalk across Fremont Boulevard and enter Fast &amp; Easy, a little grocery store run by an elderly Vietnamese couple, Mr. and Mrs. Nguyen. They were gray-haired, friendly people; she had Parkinson's, he'd had his hip replaced. "He's like Six Million Dollar Man now," she always said to me, laughing toothlessly. "Remember Six Million Dollar Man, Amir?" Then Mr. Nguyen would scowl like Lee Majors, pretend he was running in slow motion.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="1983年春季的某个星期天，我走进一家出售平装旧书的小店，旁边是家印度电影院，往东是美国国家铁路和弗里蒙特大道交界的地方。我跟爸爸说等我五分钟，他耸耸肩。他当时在弗里蒙特某个加油站上班，那天休假。我看到他横跨弗里蒙特大道，走进一家杂货便利店，店主是一对年老的越南夫妻，阮先生和他的太太。他们白发苍苍，待人友善，太太得了帕金森症，先生则换过髋骨。“他现在看起来像《无敌金刚》了，”她总是这么笑着对我说，张开没有牙齿的嘴巴。“记得《无敌金刚》吗，阿米尔？”接着阮先生会学着李·梅杰斯，怒眉倒竖，以缓慢的动作假装正在跑步。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But the Bay Area's smog stung his eyes, the traffic noise gave him headaches, and the pollen made him cough. The fruit was never sweet enough, the water never clean enough, and where were all the trees and open fields? For two years, I tried to get Baba to enroll in ESL classes to improve his broken English. But he scoffed at the idea. "Maybe I'll spell 'cat' and the teacher will give me a glittery little star so I can run home and show it off to you," he'd grumble.</div>

<div class="line_en">It turned out that Baba had had no cash on him for the oranges. He'd written Mr. Nguyen a check and Mr. Nguyen had asked for an ID. "He wants to see my license," Baba bellowed in Farsi. "Almost two years we've bought his damn fruits and put money in his pocket and the son of a dog wants to see my license!"</div>

<div class="line_en">I was flipping through a worn copy of a Mike Hammer mystery when I heard screaming and glass breaking. I dropped the book and hurried across the street. I found the Nguyens behind the counter, all the way against the wall, faces ashen, Mr. Nguyen's arms wrapped around his wife.

<div class="line_en">"Yes, you take him home. Good idea," Mr. Nguyen said. His eyes, behind his wire-rimmed bifocals, never left Baba. I led Baba through the doors. He kicked a magazine on his way out. After I'd made him promise he wouldn't go back in, I returned to the store and apologized to the Nguyens. Told them my father was going through a difficult time. I gave Mrs. Nguyen our telephone number and address, and told her to get an estimate for the damages. "Please call me as soon as you know. I'll pay for everything, Mrs. Nguyen. I'm so sorry." Mrs. Nguyen took the sheet of paper from me and nodded. I saw her hands were shaking more than usual, and that made me angry at Baba, his causing an old woman to shake like that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好的，你带他回家，好主意。”阮先生说。他戴着金丝眼镜，眼睛一直望着爸爸。我隔着门去拉爸爸，他出来的时候踢飞一本杂志。我说服他别再走进去，然后转身到店里向阮氏夫妇道歉，告诉他们爸爸处境艰难。我把家里的电话和地址给了阮太太，告诉她估计一下损失了多少东西。“算好之后请打电话给我，我会赔偿一切的，阮太太，我很抱歉。”阮太太从我手里接过纸片，点点头。我看到她的手比平时抖得更厉害，那让我很生爸爸的气，他把一个老太太吓成这样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But I didn't tell them. I thanked Mr. Nguyen for not calling the cops. Took Baba home. He sulked and smoked on the balcony while I made rice with chicken neck stew. A year and a half since we'd stepped off the Boeing from Peshawar, and Baba was still adjusting.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但我没告诉他们。我谢谢阮先生没叫警察，带爸爸回家。我炖鸡脖子饭的时候，他在阳台抽烟生闷气。我们自白沙瓦踏上波音飞机，到如今已经一年半了，爸爸仍在适应期。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Maybe we should go back to Peshawar," I said, watching the ice float in my glass of water. We'd spent six months in Peshawar waiting for the INS to issue our visas. Our grimy one-bedroom apartment smelled like dirty socks and cat droppings, but we were surrounded by people we knew -- at least people Baba knew. He'd invite the entire corridor of neighbors for dinner, most of them Afghans waiting for visas. Inevitably, someone would bring a set of tabla and someone else a harmonium. Tea would brew, and who ever had a passing singing voice would sing until the sun rose, the mosquitoes stopped buzzing, and clapping hands grew sore.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“也许我们应该回到白沙瓦。”我说，盯着在玻璃杯里面的水上浮动的冰块。我们在那里度过了半年的光阴，等待移民局核发签证。我们那间满是尘灰的房子散发出脏袜子和猫粪的气味，但住在我们周围的全是熟人——至少爸爸认得他们。他会邀请整条走廊的邻居到家里吃晚饭，他们中多数都是等待签证的阿富汗人。当然，有人会带来手鼓，也有人带手风琴。茶泡好了，嗓子还可以的人会高歌一曲，直到太阳升起，直到蚊子不再嗡嗡叫，直到鼓掌的手都酸了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I glanced at him across the table, his nails chipped and black with engine oil, his knuckles scraped, the smells of the gas station-dust, sweat, and gasoline-on his clothes. Baba was like the widower who remarries but can't let go of his dead wife. He missed the sugarcane fields of Jalalabad and the gardens of Paghman. He missed people milling in and out of his house, missed walking down the bustling aisles of Shor Bazaar and greeting people who knew him and his father, knew his grandfather, people who shared ancestors with him, whose pasts intertwined with his.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我的眼光越过桌子，望着他，他的指甲开裂，被机油弄得脏兮兮的，他的手指刮伤了，衣服散发出加油站的味道——尘灰、汗水和汽油。爸爸像个再婚的鳏夫，可是总忍不住想起故去的妻子。他怀念贾拉拉巴特的甘蔗地，还有帕格曼的花园。他怀念那些在他屋里进进出出的人们，怀念索尔市集拥挤的通道，他走在那里，和他打招呼的人认得他，认得他的父亲，认得他的祖父，那些跟他同一个祖宗的人们，他们的过去交织在一起。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Just one month after we arrived in the U. S., Baba found a job off Washington Boulevard as an assistant at a gas station owned by an Afghan acquaintance -- he'd started looking for work the same week we arrived. Six days a week, Baba pulled twelve-hour shifts pumping gas, running the register, changing oil, and washing windshields. I'd bring him lunch sometimes and find him looking for a pack of cigarettes on the shelves, a customer waiting on the other side of the oil-stained counter, Baba's face drawn and pale under the bright fluorescent lights. The electronic bell over the door would ding-dong when I walked in, and Baba would look over his shoulder, wave, and smile, his eyes watering from fatigue.</div>

<div class="line_en">The same day he was hired, Baba and I went to our eligibility officer in San Jose, Mrs. Dobbins. She was an overweight black woman with twinkling eyes and a dimpled smile. She'd told me once that she sang in church, and I believed her -- she had a voice that made me think of warm milk and honey. Baba dropped the stack of food stamps on her desk. "Thank you but I don't want," Baba said. "I work always. In Afghanistan I work, in America I work. Thank you very much, Mrs. Dobbins, but I don't like it free money."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="被聘请那天，爸爸和我到圣荷塞①去找我们的移民资格审核官杜宾斯太太。她是个很胖的黑人妇女，眼睛明亮，笑起来露出两个酒窝。有一回她跟我说她在教堂唱歌，我相信——她的声音让我想起热牛奶和蜂蜜。爸爸将一叠食物券放在她的柜台上。“谢谢你，可是我不想要。”爸爸说，“我一直有工作。在阿富汗，我有工作；在美国，我有工作。非常感谢，杜宾斯太太，可是我不喜欢接受施舍。”【注：①SanJose，美国加利福尼亚州城市。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mrs. Dobbins blinked. Picked up the food stamps, looked from me to Baba like we were pulling a prank, or "slipping her a trick" as Hassan used to say. "Fifteen years I been doin' this job and nobody's ever done this," she said. And that was how Baba ended those humiliating food stamp moments at the cash register and alleviated one of his greatest fears: that an Afghan would see him buying food with charity money. Baba walked out of the welfare office like a man cured of a tumor. THAT SUMMER OF 1983, I graduated from high school at the age of twenty, by far the oldest senior tossing his mortarboard on the football field that day. I remember losing Baba in the swarm of families, flashing cameras, and blue gowns. I found him near the twenty-yard line, hands shoved in his pockets, camera dangling on his chest. He disappeared and reappeared behind the people moving between us: squealing blue-clad girls hugging, crying, boys high-fiving their fathers, each other. Baba's beard was graying, his hair thinning at the temples, and hadn't he been taller in Kabul? He was wearing his brown suit -- his only suit, the same one he wore to Afghan weddings and funerals -- and the red tie I had bought for his fiftieth birthday that year. Then he saw me and waved. Smiled. He motioned for me to wear my mortarboard, and took a picture of me with the school's clock tower in the background. I smiled for him -- in a way, this was his day more than mine. He walked to me, curled his arm around my neck, and gave my brow a single kiss. "I am moftakhir, Amir," he said. Proud. His eyes gleamed when he said that and I liked being on the receiving end of that look.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杜宾斯太太眨眨眼，把食物券捡起来，看看我，又看看爸爸，好像我们在开她玩笑，或者像哈桑经常说的“耍她一下”。“我干这行十五年了，从来没人这么做过。”她说。就是这样，爸爸结束了在收银台用食物券支付的屈辱日子，也消除了他最担心的事情之一：被阿富汗人看到他用救济金买食物。爸爸走出福利办公室时，好像大病初愈。1983年那个夏天，我20岁，高中毕业。那天在足球场上掷帽子的人中，要数我最老了。我记得球场上满是蓝色袍子，学生的家人、闪光的镜头，把爸爸淹没了。我在二十码线附近找到他，双手插袋，相机在胸前晃荡。我们之间隔着一群人，一会儿把他挡住，一会儿他又出现。穿蓝色衣服的女生尖叫着，相互拥抱，哭泣；男生和他们的父亲拍掌庆贺。爸爸的胡子变灰了，鬓边的头发也减少了，还有，难道他在喀布尔更高？他穿着那身棕色西装——他只有这么一套，穿着它参加阿富汗人的婚礼和葬礼——系着那年他五十岁生日时我送的红色领带。接着他看到我，挥挥手，微笑。他示意我戴上方帽子，以学校的钟楼为背景，替我拍了张照片。我朝他微笑着——在某种意义上，那日子与其说是我的，毋宁说是他的。他朝我走来，伸手揽住我的脖子，亲吻了我的额头。“我很骄傲，阿米尔。”他说。他说话的时候眼睛闪亮，那样的眼光望着的是我，让我很高兴。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He took me to an Afghan kabob house in Hayward that night and ordered far too much food. He told the owner that his son was going to college in the fall. I had debated him briefly about that just before graduation, and told him I wanted to get a job. Help out, save some money, maybe go to college the following year. But he had shot me one of his smoldering Baba looks, and the words had vaporized on my tongue.</div>

<div class="line_en">After dinner, Baba took me to a bar across the street from the restaurant. The place was dim, and the acrid smell of beer I'd always disliked permeated the walls. Men in baseball caps and tank tops played pool, clouds of cigarette smoke hovering over the green tables, swirling in the fluorescent light. We drew looks, Baba in his brown suit and me in pleated slacks and sports jacket. We took a seat at the bar, next to an old man, his leathery face sickly in the blue glow of the Michelob sign overhead. Baba lit a cigarette and ordered us beers. "Tonight I am too much happy," he announced to no one and everyone. "Tonight I drinking with my son. And one, please, for my friend," he said, patting the old man on the back. The old fellow tipped his hat and smiled. He had no upper teeth.</div>

<div class="line_en">Baba finished his beer in three gulps and ordered another. He had three before I forced myself to drink a quarter of mine. By then he had bought the old man a scotch and treated a foursome of pool players to a pitcher of Budweiser. Men shook his hand and clapped him on the back. They drank to him. Someone lit his cigarette. Baba loosened his tie and gave the old man a handful of quarters. He pointed to the jukebox. "Tell him to play his favorite songs," he said to me. The old man nodded and gave Baba a salute. Soon, country music was blaring, and, just like that, Baba had started a party.</div>

<div class="line_en">SOMETIMES, I GOT BEHIND the wheel of my Ford, rolled down the windows, and drove for hours, from the East Bay to the South Bay, up the Peninsula and back. I drove through the grids of cottonwood-lined streets in our Fremont neighborhood, where people who'd never shaken hands with kings lived in shabby, flat one-story houses with barred windows, where old cars like mine dripped oil on blacktop driveways. Pencil gray chain-link fences closed off the backyards in our neighborhood. Toys, bald tires, and beer bottles with peeling labels littered unkempt front lawns. I drove past tree-shaded parks that smelled like bark, past strip malls big enough to hold five simultaneous Buzkashi tournaments. I drove the Torino up the hills of Los Altos, idling past estates with picture windows and silver lions guarding the wrought-iron gates, homes with cherub fountains lining the manicured walkways and no Ford Torinos in the drive ways. Homes that made Baba's house in Wazir Akbar Khan look like a servant's hut.</div>

<div class="line_en">I'd get up early some Saturday mornings and drive south on Highway 17, push the Ford up the winding road through the mountains to Santa Cruz. I would park by the old lighthouse and wait for sunrise, sit in my car and watch the fog rolling in from the sea. In Afghanistan, I had only seen the ocean at the cinema. Sitting in the dark next to Hassan, I had always wondered if it was true what I'd read, that sea air smelled like salt. I used to tell Hassan that someday we'd walk on a strip of seaweed-strewn beach, sink our feet in the sand, and watch the water recede from our toes. The first time I saw the Pacific, I almost cried.

<div class="line_en">By that summer, Afghan families were working an entire section of the San Jose flea market. Afghan music played in the aisles of the Used Goods section. There was an unspoken code of behavior among Afghans at the flea market: You greeted the guy across the aisle, you invited him for a bite of potato bolani or a little qabuli, and you chatted. You offered tassali, condolences, for the death of a parent, congratulated the birth of children, and shook your head mournfully when the conversation turned to Afghanistan and the Roussis -- which it inevitably did. But you avoided the topic of Saturday. Because it might turn out that the fellow across the isle was the guy you'd nearly blindsided at the freeway exit yesterday in order to beat him to a promising garage sale.</div>

We mapped our route-Fremont, Union City, Newark, and Hayward first, then San Jose, Milpitas, Sunnyvale, and Campbell if time permitted. Baba drove the bus, sipping hot tea from the thermos, and I navigated. We stopped at garage sales and bought knickknacks that people no longer wanted. We haggled over old sewing machines, one-eyed Barbie dolls, wooden tennis rackets, guitars with missing strings, and old Electrolux vacuum cleaners. By midafternoon, we'd filled the back of the VW bus with used goods. Then early Sunday mornings, we drove to the San Jose flea market off Berryessa, rented a spot, and sold the junk for a small profit: a Chicago record that we'd bought for a quarter the day before might go for $1, or $4 for a set of five; a ramshackle Singer sewing machine purchased for $10 might, after some bargaining, bring in $25.</div>

<div class="line_en">The only thing that flowed more than tea in those aisles was Afghan gossip.

<div class="line_en">Taheri. Why did the name sound familiar? The general laughed like a man used to attending formal parties where he'd laughed on cue at the minor jokes of important people. He had wispy silver-gray hair combed back from his smooth, tanned forehead, and tufts of white in his bushy eye brows. He smelled like cologne and wore an iron-gray three-piece suit, shiny from too many pressings; the gold chain of a pocket watch dangled from his vest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="塔赫里。这个名字怎么如此熟悉？将军哈哈干笑，通常在宴会上，每当重要人物说了不好笑的笑话，人们就会听到这样的笑声。他一头银发整齐地梳向后面，露出平滑的黄铜色前额，浓密的眉毛中有撮撮白色。他身上闻起来有古龙水的香味，穿着铁灰色的三排扣套装，因为洗熨了太多次而泛着亮光，背心上面露出一根怀表的金链子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Amir," Baba said, motioning me over, "this is General Sahib, Mr. Iqbal Taheri. He was a decorated general in Kabul. He worked for the Ministry of Defense."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“阿米尔，”爸爸说，示意我过去：“这是将军大人，伊克伯·塔赫里先生，原来住在喀布尔，得过军功勋章，在国防部上班。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“是专科学校。”我纠正他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"_Salaam_, General Sahib," I said, shaking his hand. His thin hands belied a firm grip, as if steel hid beneath the moisturized skin.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你好，将军大人。”我说，跟他握手。他的手貌似瘦弱，但握得很有力，好像那油亮的皮肤下面藏着钢条。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Such a lofty introduction," he said, his voice deep and cultured. "_Salaam, bachem_." Hello, my child.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这样的介绍可不敢当。”他说，他的声音低沉而有教养。“你好，我的孩子。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Amir is going to be a great writer," Baba said. I did a double take at this. "He has finished his first year of college and earned A's in all of his courses."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“阿米尔将会成为一个了不起的作家。”爸爸说。我愣了一下才反应过来。“他刚念完大学一年级，考试门门都得优。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I write fiction," I said, thinking of the dozen or so short stories I had written in the leather-bound notebook Rahim Khan had given me, wondering why I was suddenly embarrassed by them in this man's presence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我写小说。”我说着想起了自己写在拉辛汗送的皮面笔记本里面那十来个故事，奇怪自己为什么在这个人面前突然有些不自在。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Ah, a storyteller," the general said. "Well, people need stories to divert them at difficult times like this." He put his hand on Baba's shoulder and turned to me. "Speaking of stories, your father and I hunted pheasant together one summer day in Jalalabad," he said. "It was a marvelous time. If I recall correctly, your father's eye proved as keen in the hunt as it had in business."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“啊，讲故事的。”将军说，“很好，人们在如今这样的艰苦岁月需要故事来分散注意力。”他把手伸在爸爸的肩膀上，转向我。“说到故事，有一年夏天，你爸爸跟我到贾拉拉巴特去猎野鸡，”他说，“那次真叫人称奇。如果我没记错，你爸爸打猎跟他做生意一样，都是一把好手。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"_Mashallah_," General Taheri said. "Will you be writing about our country, history perhaps? Economics?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“安拉保佑。”塔赫里将军说，“你会写我们国家的故事吗，也许可以写写历史？经济？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Baba kicked a wooden tennis racket on our tarpaulin spread with the toe of his boot. "Some business."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爸爸正在用鞋尖踢着摆在我们的帆布上一把木制网球拍。“有些生意而已。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">General Taheri managed a simultaneously sad and polite smile, heaved a sigh, and gently patted Baba's shoulder. "Zendagi migzara," he said. Life goes on. He turned his eyes to me. "We Afghans are prone to a considerable degree of exaggeration, bachem, and I have heard many men foolishly labeled great. But your father has the distinction of belonging to the minority who truly deserves the label." This little speech sounded to me the way his suit looked: often used and unnaturally shiny.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="塔赫里将军露出一丝礼貌而哀伤的微笑，叹了口气，轻轻拍拍爸爸的肩膀。“生活总会继续。”他把眼光投向我，“我们阿富汗人总是喜欢夸大其词，孩子，我听过无数人愚蠢地使用‘了不起’这个词。但是，你的爸爸属于少数几个配得上这个形容词的人。”这番短短的话在我听来，跟他的衣服如出一辙：用的场合太多了，闪亮得有些造作。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I am not," the general said, tilting his head sideways and pressing his hand to his chest to convey humility. "Boys and girls must know the legacy of their fathers." He turned to me. "Do you appreciate your father, bachem? Do you really appreciate him?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我没有。”将军说，他侧过头，把手放在胸前表示尊敬，“男孩和女孩得知道他们父亲的优点。”他转向我，“你崇敬你的爸爸吗，我的孩子？你真的崇敬他吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“当然，将军大人，我崇敬他。”我说，要是他别叫我“我的孩子”就好了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Then congratulations, you are already halfway to being a man," he said with no trace of humor, no irony, the compliment of the casually arrogant.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那么，恭喜你，你已经快要长成一位男子汉了。”他说，口气没有半点幽默，没有讽刺，只有不卑不亢的恭维。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Padar jan, you forgot your tea." A young woman's voice. She was standing behind us, a slim-hipped beauty with velvety coal black hair, an open thermos and Styrofoam cup in her hand. I blinked, my heart quickening. She had thick black eyebrows that touched in the middle like the arched wings of a flying bird, and the gracefully hooked nose of a princess from old Persia -- maybe that of Tahmineh, Rostam's wife and Sohrab's mother from the _Shahnamah_. Her eyes, walnut brown and shaded by fanned lashes, met mine. Held for a moment. Flew away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“亲爱的爸爸，你忘了你的茶。”一个年轻女子的声音。她站在我们后面，是个身材苗条的美人，天鹅绒般的黑发，手里拿着一个打开的保温杯和一个塑料杯。我眨眨眼，心跳加快。她的眉毛又黑又浓，中间连在一起，宛如飞翔的鸟儿张开的双翅，笔挺的鼻子很优雅，活像古代波斯公主——也许像拓敏妮，《沙纳玛》书中罗斯坦的妻子，索拉博的妈妈。她那长长睫毛下面胡桃色的眼睛跟我对望了一会儿，移开了视线。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"My daughter, Soraya jan," General Taheri said. He took a deep breath like a man eager to change the subject and checked his gold pocket watch. "Well, time to go and set up." He and Baba kissed on the cheek and he shook my hand with both of his. "Best of luck with the writing," he said, looking me in the eye. His pale blue eyes revealed nothing of the thoughts behind them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我的女儿，亲爱的索拉雅。”塔赫里将军说。他深深吸了一口气，看来想换个话题了，他掏出金怀表，看了看时间。“好啦，到时间了，我得去整理整理。”他和爸爸相互亲吻脸颊，用双手跟我握别。“祝你写作顺利。”他盯着我的眼睛说，浅蓝色的双眼没有透露出半点他心里的想法。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You are so kind, my dear," General Taheri said. He took the cup from her. Before she turned to go, I saw she had a brown, sickle-shaped birthmark on the smooth skin just above her left jawline. She walked to a dull gray van two aisles away and put the thermos inside. Her hair spilled to one side when she kneeled amid boxes of old records and paperbacks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你真乖，我亲爱的。”塔赫里将军说，从她手里接过杯子。在她转身离去之前，我见到她光滑的皮肤上有个镰状的棕色胎记，就在左边下巴上。她走过两条通道，把保温杯放在一辆货车里面。她跪在装着唱片和平装书的盒子中间，秀发倾泻在一旁。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For the rest of that day, I fought the urge to look toward the gray van.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在那天剩下的时间里，我总忍不住望向那辆灰色的货车。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">IT CAME TO ME on our way home. Taheri, I knew I'd heard that name before.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在我们回家的路上，我想起来了。塔赫里，我知道我以前听过这个名字。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You know me," Baba said, inching the bus along the queue exiting the flea market. "Talk turns to gossip and I walk away."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你知道我的，”爸爸说，他开着巴士，在跳蚤市场出口长长的车队中缓慢前进。“每当人们说三道四我都会走开。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Wasn't there some story floating around about Taheri's daughter?" I said to Baba, trying to sound casual.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是不是有过关于塔赫里将军女儿的流言蜚语啊？”我假装漫不经心地问爸爸。">查看中文翻译</div>
