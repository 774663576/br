<div class="line_en">Harry sprinted up to the boys' dormitories to fetch the Invisibility Cloak and the Marauder's Map from his trunk; he was so quick that he and Ron were ready to leave at least five minutes before Hermione hurried back down from the girls' dormitories, wearing scarf, gloves and one of her own knobbly elf hats.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利冲到男生宿舍去拿隐形衣和活点地图，他的动作那么快，以至于他和罗恩等了起码五分钟，赫敏才急急忙忙从女生宿舍下来，戴着围巾、手套和自已织的一顶织花小精灵帽。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, it's cold out there!" she said defensively, as Ron clicked his tongue impatiently.</div>

<div class="line_en">They crept through the portrait hole and covered themselves hastily in the Cloak -- Ron had grown so much he now needed to crouch to prevent his feet showing -- then, moving slowly and cautiously, they proceeded down the many staircases, pausing at intervals to check on the map for signs of Filch or Mrs. Morris. They were lucky; they saw nobody but Nearly Headless Nick, who was gliding along absent-mindedly humming something that sounded horribly like "Weasley is our King'. They crept across the Entrance Hall and out into the silent, snowy grounds. With a great leap of his heart, Harry saw little golden squares of light ahead and smoke coiling up from Hagrid's chimney. He set off at a quick march, the other two jostling and bumping along behind him. They crunched excitedly through the thickening snow until at last they reached the wooden front door. When Harry raised his fist and knocked three times, a dog started barking frantically inside.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们爬出肖像洞口，匆匆钻进隐形衣——罗恩长了不少，他必须弯着腰才能把脚藏在里面。然后三人小心翼翼地走下许多楼梯，时而停下来在地图上查看一下费尔奇和洛丽丝夫人的踪影。他们很幸运，路上只碰到了差点没头的尼克，他飘飘荡荡，无心地哼着歌曲，听上去与“韦斯莱是我们的王”惊人地相似。他们蹑手蹑脚地穿过门厅，来到静悄悄的雪地上。看到前面那一小方金色的灯光和海格烟囱上袅袅的青烟，哈利的心剧烈地跳了起来。他加快了步伐，另两人跌跌撞撞地跟在后面。他们激动地踏着积雪走到木门前，哈利举手敲了三声，一条狗在里面狂吠起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Hagrid's hair was matted with congealed blood and his left eye had been reduced to a puffy slit amid a mass of purple and black bruising. There were many cuts on his face and hands, some of them still bleeding, and he was moving gingerly, which made Harry suspect broken ribs. It was obvious that he had only just got home: a thick black travelling cloak lay over the back of a chair and a haversack large enough to carry several small children leaned against the wall inside the door. Hagrid himself, twice the size of a normal man, was now limping over to the fire and placing a copper kettle over it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="海格的头发乱糟糟的，上面结着血块，他的左眼肿成了一条缝，又青又紫，脸上和手上伤痕累累，有的还在流血，他动作很小心，哈利怀疑可能肋骨断了。他显然刚刚到家，一件厚厚的黑色旅行斗篷搭在椅背上，一个装得下几个小孩的大背包靠在墙边。有正常人两倍高、三倍宽的海格一瘸一拐地走向火炉，在火上搁了一个铜水壶。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm sorry!" Hermione gasped, as the three of them squeezed past Hagrid into the house and pulled the Cloak off themselves so he could see them. "I just -- oh, Hagrid!"</div>

<div class="line_en">He walked across to the enormous wooden table that stood in the middle of his cabin and twitched aside a tea towel that had been lying on it. Underneath was a raw, bloody, green-tinged steak slightly larger than the average car tyre.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他走到小屋中间那张巨大的木桌前，揭去桌上的一块茶巾，下面是一条带血的生肉，绿莹莹的，比普通汽车轮胎稍大一点。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“是啊，狩猎场看守一定很难呼吸到新鲜空气。”乌姆里奇亲切地说。海格脸上没有青紫色的那一小块皮肤变红了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yeah… well… sensitive skin," said Hagrid, attempting an ingratiating smile. Harry noticed that two of his teeth had been knocked out.

<div class="line_cn" title="“啊…是…皮肤敏感。”海格想做出一个讨好的笑容，哈利注意到他掉了两颗牙齿。乌姆里奇冷冷地看着他，他的笑容挂不住了。然后她把皮包往臂弯里拉了拉说：“我自然会向部长报告你这么晚回来。”">查看中文翻译</div>
