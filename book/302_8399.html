<div class="line_en">She wondered that Lucy's spirits could be so very much elevated by thecivility of Mrs. Ferrars; -- that her interest and her vanity should sovery much blind her as to make the attention which seemed only paid herbecause she was NOT ELINOR, appear a compliment to herself-or to allowher to derive encouragement from a preference only given her, becauseher real situation was unknown. But that it was so, had not only beendeclared by Lucy's eyes at the time, but was declared over again thenext morning more openly, for at her particular desire, Lady Middletonset her down in Berkeley Street on the chance of seeing Elinor alone, to tell her how happy she was.</div>

<div class="line_en">Elinor's curiosity to see Mrs. Ferrars was satisfied. -- She had foundin her every thing that could tend to make a farther connection betweenthe families undesirable. -- She had seen enough of her pride, hermeanness, and her determined prejudice against herself, to comprehendall the difficulties that must have perplexed the engagement, andretarded the marriage, of Edward and herself, had he been otherwisefree; -- and she had seen almost enough to be thankful for her OWN sake, that one greater obstacle preserved her from suffering under any otherof Mrs. Ferrars's creation, preserved her from all dependence upon hercaprice, or any solicitude for her good opinion. Or at least, if shedid not bring herself quite to rejoice in Edward's being fettered toLucy, she determined, that had Lucy been more amiable, she OUGHT tohave rejoiced.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃丽诺想见见费拉斯太太的好奇心得到了满足。她发现她身上一无是处，在这种情况下两家再去攀亲，那是很不理想的。她看清了她的傲慢、自私和对她自己的顽固偏见，因而可以理解：即使爱德华不受约束地同她订了婚，那也一定会遇到重重困难，使他们迟迟不能结婚。她看得真切，几乎在为自己感到庆幸！由于遇到了一个较大的障碍，她可以免于遭遇费拉斯太太设置的任何其他障碍，可以免于忍受她那反复无常的脾性，免于费尽心机地去赢得她的好感。或者，如果说她对爱德华迷上露西还不能感到十分高兴的话，她至少可口断定：假如露西更加和蔼一些，她本应感到高兴的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a very awkward moment; and the countenance of each shewed thatit was so. They all looked exceedingly foolish; and Edward seemed tohave as great an inclination to walk out of the room again, as toadvance farther into it. The very circumstance, in its unpleasantestform, which they would each have been most anxious to avoid, had fallenon them. -- They were not only all three together, but were togetherwithout the relief of any other person. The ladies recoveredthemselves first. It was not Lucy's business to put herself forward, and the appearance of secrecy must still be kept up. She couldtherefore only LOOK her tenderness, and after slightly addressing him, said no more.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是个令人非常尴尬的时刻，每个人的脸色表明，情况确实如此。一个个看上去呆痴痴的，爱德华似乎又想往里进，又想往外退。这种难堪的局面本是他们极力想避免的，现在却在所难逃了＿＿他们不仅三个人都碰到一起了，而且没有任何其他人帮助解围。两位小姐先恢复了镇定。露西不敢上前表示亲热，他们表面上还要保守秘密。因此，她只能用眼色传送柔情蜜意，嘴里刚与他寒暄了两句，便不再作声了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But Elinor had more to do; and so anxious was she, for his sake and herown, to do it well, that she forced herself, after a moment'srecollection, to welcome him, with a look and manner that were almosteasy, and almost open; and another struggle, another effort stillimproved them. She would not allow the presence of Lucy, nor theconsciousness of some injustice towards herself, to deter her fromsaying that she was happy to see him, and that she had very muchregretted being from home, when he called before in Berkeley Street. She would not be frightened from paying him those attentions which, asa friend and almost a relation, were his due, by the observant eyes ofLucy, though she soon perceived them to be narrowly watching her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，埃丽诺倒想多说几句，而且为了爱德华和她自己，还一心要处理得当一些。她稍许定了定神，硬是装出一副近乎坦率大方的神态，对他的到来表示欢迎，再经过一番努力，则显得更加神态自若了。尽管露西在场，尽管她知道自己受到了亏待，但她还是对他说：“见到他很高兴，他上次来伯克利街时，她不在家，很遗憾。”虽然她马上察觉露西那双锐利的眼睛正在直溜溜地盯着她，她却没有畏怯，本来就是朋友嘛，还多少算个亲戚，她还是对他以礼相待。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="她的这般举止使爱德华消释了几分躁虑，鼓起勇气坐了下来。不过，他还是比两位小姐显得更窘些，这种情形对男子汉来说虽不多见，但具体到他，倒也合乎情理。因为他既不像露西那样毫不在乎，也不像埃丽诺那祥心安理得。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Her exertions did not stop here; for she soon afterwards felt herselfso heroically disposed as to determine, under pretence of fetchingMarianne, to leave the others by themselves; and she really did it, andTHAT in the handsomest manner, for she loitered away several minutes onthe landing-place, with the most high-minded fortitude, before she wentto her sister. When that was once done, however, it was time for theraptures of Edward to cease; for Marianne's joy hurried her into thedrawing-room immediately. Her pleasure in seeing him was like everyother of her feelings, strong in itself, and strongly spoken. She methim with a hand that would be taken, and a voice that expressed theaffection of a sister.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃丽诺的一番苦心没有到此结束，不一会儿，她心里产生了一股豪情，便决定借口去喊玛丽安，将他们两人留在房里。她果真这么做了，而且做得极其大方，因为她怀着无比高尚的刚毅精神，在楼梯口盘桓了半天之后，才去叫她妹妹。可是一旦把妹妹请来，爱德华那种欣喜若狂的劲头也就得结束了。原来，玛丽安听说爱德华来了非常高兴，马上急急忙忙地跑到客厅。她一见到他高兴极了，就像她往常一样，感情充沛，言词热烈。她走上前去，伸出一只手让他握，说话声流露出做小姨子的深情厚意。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And drawing him a little aside, she whispered her persuasion that Lucycould not stay much longer. But even this encouragement failed, for hewould go; and Lucy, who would have outstaid him, had his visit lastedtwo hours, soon afterwards went away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她把他拉到旁边一点，低声对他说：露西不会呆得很久。但是，她甚至这样鼓励也无济于事，因为他执意要走。本来，即使他呆上两个小时，露西也会奉陪到底的，现在见他走了，随后也接踵而去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Going so soon!" said Marianne; "my dear Edward, this must not be."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这么快就走！”玛丽安说。“我亲爱的爱德华，这可不行呀：”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Why so? -- we were all his friends, and Lucy has been the longest knownto him of any. It is but natural that he should like to see her aswell as ourselves."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这为什么？我们大家都是他的朋友，露西认识他的时间比谁都长，他想见见我们，自然也想见见她。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What can bring her here so often?" said Marianne, on her leaving them."Could not she see that we wanted her gone! -- how teazing to Edward!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“她为什么老到这里来？”她一走，玛丽安便说道。“她难道后不出来我们要她走？真让爱德华哭笑不得！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The nature of her commendation, in the present case, however, happenedto be particularly ill-suited to the feelings of two thirds of herauditors, and was so very unexhilarating to Edward, that he very soongot up to go away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，听了她的这番赞扬，她的三分之二的听众心里觉得特别不是滋味，而爱德华更是大为不快，马上起身往外走去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Marianne looked at her steadily, and said, "You know, Elinor, that thisis a kind of talking which I cannot bear. If you only hope to haveyour assertion contradicted, as I must suppose to be the case, youought to recollect that I am the last person in the world to do it. Icannot descend to be tricked out of assurances, that are not reallywanted."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛丽安目不转睛地望着她，然后说：“你知道，埃丽诺，你这样说话真叫我受不了。我看你说这话是存心想叫别人反驳你，要真是这样的话，你应该记得，我是决不会这么干的。我不能上你的当，下作地说些毫无意义的废话。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She then left the room; and Elinor dared not follow her to say more, for bound as she was by her promise of secrecy to Lucy, she could giveno information that would convince Marianne; and painful as theconsequences of her still continuing in an error might be, she wasobliged to submit to it. All that she could hope, was that Edwardwould not often expose her or himself to the distress of hearingMarianne's mistaken warmth, nor to the repetition of any other part ofthe pain that had attended their recent meeting-and this she had everyreason to expect.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她说罢走出房去。埃丽诺不敢跟着她再说什么，因为她向露西保证过要保守秘密，她无法说出让玛丽安信服的情况。尽管这将错就错的后果是痛苦的，但她只得格守诺言。她只能希望，爱德华不要让她或他自己经常听见玛丽安信口开河地瞎说一通，也不要重新引起他们最近这次会见所招致的其他痛苦一一而这是她有充分理由加以期待的。">查看中文翻译</div>
