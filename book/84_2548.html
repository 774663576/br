<div class="line_en">I filled my journals with promises that I would stay out of the junkyard. I needed money -- Dad would have said I was broker than the Ten Commandments -- so I went to get my old job back at Stokes. I turned up at the busiest hour in the afternoon, when I knew they'd be understaffed, and sure enough, the manager was bagging groceries when I found him. I asked if he'd like me to do that, and he looked at me for all of three seconds, then lifted his apron over his head and handed it to me. The assistant manager gave me a wink: she was the one who'd suggested I ask during the rush. There was something about Stokes -- about its straight, clean aisles and the warm people who worked there -- that made me feel calm and happy. It's a strange thing to say about a grocery store, but it felt like home.</div>

<div class="line_en">Dad's face was haggard, his eyes bloodshot. He'd had a spectacularly bad winter. In the fall, he'd invested a large sum of money in new construction equipment -- an excavator, a man lift and a welding trailer. Now it was spring and all of it was gone. Luke had accidentally lit the welding trailer on fire, burning it to the ground; the man lift had come off a trailer because someone -- I never asked who -- hadn't secured it properly; and the excavator had joined the scrap heap when Shawn, pulling it on an enormous trailer, had taken a corner too fast and rolled truck and trailer both. With the luck of the damned, Shawn had crawled from the wreckage, although he'd hit his head and couldn't remember the days before the accident. Truck, trailer and excavator were totaled.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爸爸脸色憔悴，眼睛充血。他度过了一个异常糟糕的冬天。秋天，他投资了一大笔钱购买新的建筑设备——一台挖掘机、一台载人升降机、一辆焊接拖车。到了春天，这些设备全都没了。卢克不小心点燃了焊接拖车，将它烧成了灰烬；载人升降机从拖车上掉下来，因为有人——我没问是谁——没把它固定好；挖掘机已进了废料堆，肖恩用大拖车拉它时转弯速度过快，撞上了卡车。不幸中的万幸是，肖恩从残骸中爬了出来，尽管他撞了头，把事故发生前的事都忘了。卡车、拖车和挖掘机全部报废。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But I couldn't do the job, because to do it would be to slide backward. I had moved home, to my old room, to my old life.

But now that I had pulled it, I understood its futility. It did nothing after all.</div>

<div class="line_en">Dad was in the forklift, scooping up a stack of corrugated tin. He would need someone to place wooden blocks on the trailer so he could offload the stack. When he saw me, he lowered the tin so I could step onto it, and I rode the stack up and onto the trailer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爸爸正在叉车里，铲起一堆瓦楞铁皮。他需要个人手将木块放在拖车上，这样他就可以卸货了。看到我时，他将铁皮放低，以便我可以踩着上去。我骑上那堆东西，上了拖车。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I hung up and dialed Stokes. The assistant manager answered. "You done working today?" she said brightly. I told her I quit, said I was sorry, then put down the phone.

<div class="line_en">My memories of the university faded quickly. The scratch of pencils on paper, the clack of a projector moving to the next slide, the peal of the bells signaling the end of class -- all were drowned out by the clatter of iron and the roar of diesel engines.

<div class="line_en">There was a play that summer at the Worm Creek Opera House, and Shawn and I bought tickets. Charles was also there, a few rows ahead of us, and at intermission when Shawn moved away to chat up a girl, he shuffled over. For the first time I was not utterly tongue-tied. I thought of Shannon and how she'd talked to people at church, the friendly merriment of her, the way she laughed and smiled. Just be Shannon, I thought to myself. And for five minutes, I was.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那年夏天，虫溪剧场要上演一出剧，我和肖恩买了票。查尔斯也来了，就坐在我们前几排。中场休息时，趁着肖恩离开去搭讪一个女孩，查尔斯慢吞吞地走了过来。第一次，我没有舌头打结。我想起了香农，想起她在教堂与人交谈的样子，想起她友好的欢声笑语，以及她微笑和开怀大笑的样子。就当自己是香农吧，我想。接下来的五分钟，我成了香农。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Charles was looking at me strangely, the way I'd seen men look at Shannon. He asked if I'd like to see a movie on Saturday. The movie he suggested was vulgar, worldly, one I would never want to see, but I was being Shannon, so I said I'd love to.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="查尔斯用怪异的目光看着我，与我见过的那些男人看香农的眼神一样。他问我星期六想不想去看电影。他提议去看的那部电影俗不可耐，是我自己永远不会去看的那种，但我在扮演香农，所以我说我很乐意去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The only difference was Shawn. He was not what I remembered. He never said a harsh word, seemed at peace with himself. He was studying for his GED, and one night when we were driving back from a job, he told me he was going to try a semester at a community college. He wanted to study law.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="唯一的变化是肖恩。他不再是我记忆中的人。他不再厉声说话，似乎变得心平气和。他正在为GED[7]复习，一天晚上，我们干完活开车回家时，他告诉我他要去社区大学念一个学期。他想学法律。【注：[7]GED（General Educational Development），普通同等学力证书，北美针对非高中毕业生的一项考试，通过后可以获得与高中毕业文凭等同的学历证明。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I tried to be Shannon on Saturday night. The movie was terrible, worse than I'd expected, the kind of movie only a gentile would see. But it was hard for me to see Charles as a gentile. He was just Charles. I thought about telling him the movie was immoral, that he shouldn't be seeing such things, but -- still being Shannon -- I said nothing, just smiled when he asked if I'd like to get ice cream.</div>

<div class="line_en">Charles called a few days later. I was standing in my room after a day of roofing. I smelled of paint thinner and was covered in dust the color of ash, but he didn't know that. We talked for two hours. He called the next night, and the one after. He said we should get a burger on Friday.</div>

<div class="line_en">In my room, I stared at myself in the mirror for a long time. The first thing I noticed was my men's jeans and how they were nothing like the jeans other girls wore. The second thing I noticed was that my shirt was too large and made me seem more square than I was.</div>

<div class="line_en">On thursday, after I'd finished scrapping, I drove forty miles to the nearest Walmart and bought a pair of women's jeans and two shirts, both blue. When I put them on, I barely recognized my own body, the way it narrowed and curved. I took them off immediately, feeling that somehow they were immodest. They weren't, not technically, but I knew why I wanted them -- for my body, so it would be noticed -- and that seemed immodest even if the clothes were not.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="星期四，拆完废品，我驱车四十英里去了最近的沃尔玛，买了一条女士牛仔裤和两件蓝色衬衫。当我穿上它们，我几乎认不出自己的身体，认不出它苗条有曲线的样子。我立刻脱下衣服，觉得这些衣服不够端庄。严格地说，衣服不算出格，但是我知道自己为什么想买它们——为了我的身体能被注意到——即便衣服没有问题，这个想法也让它们不够端庄。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The next afternoon, when the crew had finished for the day, I ran to the house. I showered, blasting away the dirt, then I laid the new clothes on my bed and stared at them. After several minutes, I put them on and was again shocked by the sight of myself. There wasn't time to change so I wore a jacket even though it was a warm evening, and at some point, though I can't say when or why, I decided that I didn't need the jacket after all. For the rest of the night, I didn't have to remember to be Shannon; I talked and laughed without pretending at all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天下午，小工队收工后，我跑回家。我冲了个澡，洗去身上的灰尘，然后把新衣服摆在床上，盯着它们看。几分钟后，我穿上它们，再次被自己的形象震惊。没有时间换衣服了，于是我套了一件夹克，尽管那是一个暖和的夜晚。然后在某个时刻，不知为何，我决定我根本不需要那件夹克了。那一晚接下来的时间，我不必提醒自己是香农；我有说有笑，一点儿也不必装腔作势。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Charles and I spent every evening together that week. We haunted public parks and ice cream shops, burger joints and gas stations. I took him to Stokes, because I loved it there, and because the assistant manager would always give me the unsold doughnuts from the bakery. We talked about music -- about bands I'd never heard of and about how he wanted to be a musician and travel the world. We never talked about us -- about whether we were friends or something else. I wished he would bring it up but he didn't. I wished he would let me know some other way -- by gently taking my hand or putting an arm around me -- but he didn't do that, either.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="第二天下午，我和查尔斯在公园里懒洋洋地荡着轮胎秋千。我把奖学金的事告诉了他。我本想炫耀一番，但不知为何，我的恐惧油然而生。我说我不该上大学，我应该先读完高中，或者至少去读一读高中。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I said nothing. I'd never heard anyone criticize my father except Shawn, and I wasn't able to respond to it.

<div class="line_cn" title="我什么也没说。除了肖恩，我从没听过任何人批评我的父亲，对此我没法回应。我想告诉查尔斯关于光明会的事，但这些话属于父亲，甚至连我都觉得它们听上去很尴尬，像是事先排练过的。我无法让这些话属于我，为此我感到羞愧。那时的我相信——一部分的我将永远会相信——父亲的话应该也是我自己的观点。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When he finally did, it was early evening and we were in his jeep, driving to his house to watch a movie. We were just coming parallel to Fivemile Creek when he reached across the gearshift and rested his hand on mine. His hand was warm and I wanted to take it, but instead I jerked away as if I'd been burned. The response was involuntary, and I wished immediately that I could take it back. It happened again when he tried a second time. My body convulsed, yielding to a strange, potent instinct.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当他终于那么做的时候，是在一个傍晚，我们坐在他的吉普车里，开车去他家看电影。我们正沿五里溪前行，他突然越过变速挡，将手放在我的手上。他的手很温暖，我想握住它，但我却猛地抽开手，就像被烫了一下。这种反应不由自主，我真希望能立即收回。他第二次尝试时，我还是这种反应。我身体抽搐，屈服于一种奇怪又强烈的本能。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, I'm angry," he said. "Even if you aren't."</div>

<div class="line_en">Every night for a month, when I came in from the junkyard, I'd spend an hour scrubbing grime from my fingernails and dirt from my ears. I'd brush the tangles from my hair and clumsily apply makeup. I'd rub handfuls of lotion into the pads of my fingers to soften the calluses, just in case that was the night Charles touched them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一个月来的每天晚上，我从废料场回来时，都会花一个小时洗掉指甲和耳朵里的灰尘和污垢。我会将打结的头发梳好，笨拙地化妆。我会在手指肚涂上厚厚一层乳液，让老茧软化，以防某一晚查尔斯会摸到它们。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I shoved my hands under my knees and leaned into the window. I couldn't let him near me -- not that night, and not any night for months -- without shuddering as that word, my word, ripped its way into remembrance. Whore.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我将双手放在膝盖下，斜靠车窗。我不肯让查尔斯靠近我——那天晚上，以及接下来几个月的晚上——都不行，当那个词，我的专属词，闯入我的记忆，我战栗不已。妓女。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We arrived at his house. Charles turned on the TV and settled onto the sofa; I perched lightly on one side. The lights dimmed, the opening credits rolled. Charles inched toward me, slowly at first, then more confidently, until his leg brushed mine. In my mind I bolted, I ran a thousand miles in a single heartbeat. In reality I merely flinched. Charles flinched, too -- I'd startled him. I repositioned myself, driving my body into the sofa arm, gathering my limbs and pressing them away from him. I held that unnatural pose for perhaps twenty seconds, until he understood, hearing the words I couldn't say, and moved to the floor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们来到他家。查尔斯打开电视，坐到沙发上，我轻轻坐在另一边。灯光暗下来，片头字幕滚动着。查尔斯一点一点靠近我，起初慢慢地，后来更有信心，直到他的腿碰到了我的腿。想象中我飞快逃离，一次心跳间便逃到了千里之外。事实上，我只是退缩了。查尔斯也退缩了——我把他吓了一跳。我调整姿势，身体陷进沙发扶手里，并紧四肢，尽量远离他。这个不自然的姿势我保持了大概二十秒，直到他明白了我没有言明的意思，挪到了地板上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The instinct passed through me in the form of a word, a bold lyric, strong, declarative. The word was not new. It had been with me for a while now, hushed, motionless, as if asleep, in some remote corner of memory. By touching me Charles had awakened it, and it throbbed with life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="本能传递给我一个词，一个大胆的词，有力，有陈述性。这个词并不新鲜。它已经陪伴我很久，静静地，一动不动，仿佛沉睡过去，栖居在记忆深处某个遥远的角落。查尔斯的触摸唤醒了它，让它重新鲜活起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
