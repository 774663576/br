<div class="line_cn" title="我忘了她的身体是很硬实的，碰到她就像一头撞到了水泥墙上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I locked my arms around her, gasping to inhale as much of the scent of her skin as possible. It wasn't like anything else -- not floral or spice, citrus or musk. No perfume in the world could compare. My memory hadn't done it justice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我双手搂着她，大口大口地喘气，贪婪地感受她的体香。她的皮肤有着特殊的香味——既不是花香、辛香，也不是柑橘或麝香。这奇香就是举世的香水亦无法比拟，比我记忆中她的香味还要美妙。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Bella?" There was a strange mingling of relief and confusion in her voice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“贝拉？”她开口了，声音中好似有些解脱又有些迷惑，这种混合甚是奇怪。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I didn't notice when the gasping turned into something else -- I only realized I was sobbing when Alice dragged me to the living room couch and pulled me into her lap. It was like curling up into a cool stone, but a stone that was contoured comfortingly to the shape of my body. She rubbed my back in a gentle rhythm, waiting for me to get control of myself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不知何时我从喘气变成了抽泣——直到爱丽丝费力地把我扶到客厅的沙发，把我的上身挪到她的大腿上时，我才意识到自己在低泣。我感觉像蜷缩在清凉的石头上，躺得很舒适，因为这石头极好地贴着我的身体，仿佛是依人赋形的。我反复轻抚着我的背，等待我冷静下来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It's my own fault. It's been too long since I hunted. I shouldn't let myself get so thirsty. But I was in a hurry today." The look she directed at me then was a glare. "Speaking of which, would you like to explain to me how you're alive?"</div>

It's just that I'm alreacy attuned to you… when I saw you jumping, I didn't think, I just got on a plane. I knew I would be too late, but I couldn't do nothing. And then I get here, thinking maybe I could help Charlie somehow, and you drive up." She shook her head, this time in confusion. Her voice was strained. "I saw you go into the water and I waited and waited for you to come up, but you didn't. What happened? And how could you do that to Charlie? Did you stop to think what this would do to him? And my brother? Do you have any idea what Edward --"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“但是我不看并不意味着我不会看见，”她继续道，“我并没有监视你，贝拉，真的，我可以发誓。和你在一起是如此和谐……看到你跳的那一刻，我想也没想，就上了飞机。我知道一定赶不及，但是要我什么都不做，我做不到，于是我就到这儿来了，心想也许可以帮帮查理。然后我就开车回来了。”说完，她迷惑地摇摇头，声音变得焦虑起来，“看到你沉没到水里后，我就等啊等啊，等你的头冒出来，但一直没等到。发生了什么事？你怎么能这样对待查理呢？还有我哥哥？你知不知道爱德华他——”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Alice shook her head. "I told him this would happen, but he didn't believe me.

<div class="line_cn" title="我又说：“要是雅各布没有跟着跳下去，我的确很可能会被淹死的。好吧，不是可能，是肯定会被淹死，但是他跳下去了，把我拉上来，我猜他又把我拖到了岸上，虽然那时我已经没有了知觉。从我被淹到他抓住我，最多不过一分钟，你怎么没看见这些？”">查看中文翻译</div>

"He's a year or so younger than her, and I know she used to think of him as a friend, but I think maybe it's something more now, or headed that direction, anyway." Charlie said this in a tone that was almost belligerent. It was a warning, not for Alice, but for her to pass along. "Jake's old for his years," he continued, still sounding defensive. "He's taken care of his father physically the way Bella took care of her mother emotionally. It matured him. He's a good-looking kid, too -- takes after his mom's side.
