<div class="line_en">There was only one light on at camp, in the office. The sky was cloudy, so there was very little starlight. Stanley could see a sliver of a moon, which appeared and disappeared among the clouds.</div>

<div class="line_en">He carefully led Zero to the hole, which was hard to find in the darkness. He stumbled over a small pile of dirt. "I think this is it," he whispered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他小心翼翼地带着零蛋走向那个洞。天太黑了，想要找到太不容易了。他被一个小土堆绊了一下。“我觉得就是这个。”他低声说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He wasn't sure how long he remained in the hole, maybe five hours. He was surprised when he heard Zero whispering for him to wake up. He didn't think he'd fallen asleep. If he had, he thought it must have just been for the last five minutes. Although, when he opened his eyes, he was surprised how dark it was.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他不知道在洞里待了多久，或许有五个钟头。零蛋唤醒他的时候，他感到有些吃惊。他以为自己并没有睡着。就算他睡着了，那也最多小憩了五分钟而已。睁开眼睛的时候，浓浓的夜色令他大吃一惊。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He took a drink from the canteen. He had given Zero the water jars. They each had a good supply of onions.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他喝了点水壶里的水。他把罐子都交给零蛋了。他们还美美地饱餐了一顿洋葱。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You think?" Zero asked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你觉得？”零蛋问道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Stanley tried to sleep, not knowing when he'd get the chance again. He heard the showers and, later, the sounds of dinner. He heard the creaking of the Wreck Room door. His fingers drummed against the side of the hole. He heard his own heart beat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯坦利不知道什么时候才有机会动手，便想睡会儿。他听到淋浴的声音，接着又传来吃饭的声音。他还听到破坏室的门被打开的吱嘎声。他的手指在敲打洞壁。他甚至听到了自己的心跳声。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Stanley stuck the shovel into the dirt at the bottom of the hole and stepped on the back of the blade. He felt it sink beneath his weight. He scooped out some dirt and tossed it off to the side. Then he brought the shovel back down.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他将铲子插进洞底，然后一脚踩在铲片上。他感到铲子在重压下陷进土里。他挖了些土，抛到一旁，然后又继续挖。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's it," said Stanley, sounding more certain than he really was. He climbed down. Zero handed him the shovel.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“就是这个。”斯坦利的声音听上去似乎更有底气。他钻进了洞里。零蛋把铲子递给他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Zero watched for a while. "I'm going to try to refill the water jars," he said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="零蛋盯看了一会儿。“我去给罐子再灌点水。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As he made the hole deeper, it became harder to lift the dirt up and out. It was five feet deep before he even started. He decided to use his efforts to make it wider instead.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="洞越来越深，把土举起来再抛到洞外变得越来越费力。动手之前，洞已经有五英尺深了，于是他决定把洞挖得宽一些。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This made more sense, he told himself. If Kate Barlow had buried a treasure chest, she probably wouldn't have been able to dig much deeper, so why should he?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他告诉自己，这样更管用。如果凯特·巴洛的确埋过一箱财宝，她应该不大可能把洞挖得那么深。那么，他干吗要往深里挖呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Stanley took a deep breath and exhaled. "Be careful," he said, then continued digging.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯坦利深吸一口气，又呼出来。“小心点。”他说，然后又继续挖。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was so dark, he couldn't even see the end of his shovel. For all he knew he could be digging up gold and diamonds instead of dirt. He brought each shovelful close to his face, to try to see if anything was there, before dumping it out of the hole.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="天太黑了，就连铲尖都看不到。他只知道自己要挖的是金子和钻石，而不是泥土。每挖一铲，他都要把土凑到眼前，想在倒掉之前确认里面有没有其他东西。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“想来点早点吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Of course, Kate Barlow probably had a whole gang of thieves helping her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当然，或许有一伙盗贼帮着凯特·巴洛挖。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Zero handed down a box of cereal. Stanley carefully poured some cereal into his mouth. He didn't want to put his dirty hands inside the box. He nearly gagged on the ultra-sweet taste. They were sugar-frosted flakes, and after eating nothing but onions for more than a week, he had trouble adjusting to the flavor. He washed them down with a swig of water.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="零蛋递给他一盒谷物。斯坦利小心翼翼地往嘴里倒了一些。他不想把脏兮兮的手伸进盒子里。味道太甜了，他差点吐了。吃了一个多星期的洋葱，再吃糖霜薄片，他很难适应这种味道。他就着水把它们咽了下去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Stanley jumped at the sound of Zero's voice. He hadn't heard him approach.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="听到零蛋的声音，斯坦利跳了起来。他根本没有觉察零蛋过来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They finished the water that Zero had gotten from the spigot by the showers. Stanley said he'd go fill the jars again, but Zero insisted that he do it instead. "No offense, but you make too much noise when you walk. You're too big."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们喝光了零蛋从浴室的水龙头打来的水。斯坦利说这一次由他去打水，可零蛋坚持要自己去。“没有冒犯你的意思。只是你走路时的动静太大了。你太壮了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Zero took over the digging. Stanley sifted his fingers through the fresh piles of dirt, in case he had missed anything. He wished he had a flashlight. A diamond no bigger than a pebble would be worth thousands of dollars. Yet there was no way he'd see it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="零蛋开始挖了。斯坦利用手当筛子，把新挖出来的土又过滤一遍，生怕有所遗漏。他真希望有把手电筒。一颗比鹅卵石大不了多少的钻石就能值几千美元，可他没法看清楚。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Stanley shrugged one shoulder. He brought the shovel down the side of the hole, shaving off a slice of the dirt wall. As he did so, he felt the shovel bounce off something hard.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯坦利耸了耸肩。他在洞壁上挖下一点土。这时，他感到铲子撞到了一个硬邦邦的东西。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Stanley returned to the hole. As the hole grew wider, parts of the surface kept caving in. They were running out of room. To make it much wider, they would first have to move some of the surrounding dirt piles out of the way. He wondered how much time they had before the camp woke up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯坦利又回到了洞里。洞越挖越宽，洞口有些地方出现了塌陷。已经没地方堆放泥土了。要想进一步拓宽洞，他们必须先清理掉周围的土堆。他不知道在大家起床之前他俩还剩下多少时间。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"How's it going?" Zero asked when he returned with the water.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“怎么样了？”零蛋带着水回来了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was sticking out of the side of the hole, about a foot and a half from the bottom. He felt it with his hands.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="它从洞壁突了出来，距离地面大约有一英尺半。斯坦利用手摸了摸。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What was that?" Zero asked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那是什么？”零蛋问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What is it?" Zero asked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是什么？”零蛋问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He could just feel a corner of it. Most of it was still buried. It had the cool, smooth texture of metal. "I think I might have found the treasure chest," he said. His voice was filled more with astonishment than with excitement.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他只能摸到一角。大部分还埋在土里。这是一个冰凉光滑的金属物。“我想找到财宝箱了。”斯坦利的声音里惊讶多于兴奋。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Stanley didn't know. He moved his shovel up and down the side of the hole. As the dirt chipped and flaked away, the hard object became more pronounced.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯坦利也不知道。他拿着铲子在洞壁上上下刮动。土成片地碎裂剥落下来，那个坚硬的物体变得越来越明显。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Really?" asked Zero.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“真的吗？”零蛋问道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I think so," Stanley said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我想是的。”斯坦利说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The hole was wide enough for him to hold the shovel lengthwise and dig sideways into the wall. He knew he had to dig very carefully. He didn't want the side of the hole to collapse, along with the huge pile of dirt directly above it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="洞宽得让他能够将铲子横过来侧着铲洞壁。他知道必须十分小心。他可不希望洞壁和堆在上面的那一大堆土一起塌下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He scraped at the dirt wall, until he exposed one entire side of the box-like object. He ran his fingers over it. It felt to be about eight inches tall, and almost two feet wide. He had no way of knowing how far into the earth it extended. He tried pulling it out, but it wouldn't budge.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他刮着泥墙，盒状物的整个侧面露出来了。他摸了一下，大约八英寸高，两英尺宽。他没办法搞清楚这东西还有多少埋在土里。他试着把它拽出来，但它纹丝不动。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Go for it," said Zero.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“动手吧。”零蛋说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was afraid that the only way to get to it was to start back up at the surface, and dig down. They didn't have time for that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他担心要把它弄出来就只能重新从表面往下挖。他们可没有那么多时间了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm going to try to dig a hole underneath it," he said. "Then maybe I can pull it down and slip it out."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我试着在它下面挖个洞。”他说，“这样的话，没准就能让它掉下去，然后把它拉来。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Stanley jammed the shovel into the bottom edge of his hole, and carefully began to dig a tunnel underneath the metal object. He hoped it didn't cave in.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯坦利把铲子扎进洞底，小心翼翼地在金属物件下面挖起通道。这会儿，他只希望洞不要塌。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Occasionally he'd stop, stoop down, and try to feel the far end of the box. But even when the tunnel was as long as his arm, he still couldn't feel the other side.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有时他会停下来，俯身摸摸盒子另一端还有多深。通道已经挖得跟他的胳膊一样长了，可他还是摸不到。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As his tunnel grew deeper and wider -- and more precarious -- Stanley was able to feel latches on one end of the box, and then a leather handle. It wasn't really a box. "I think it might be some kind of metal suitcase," he told Zero.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="通道越挖越深，越挖越宽——也就是越挖越危险。斯坦利总算能摸到了另一端的锁了，接着是皮把手。事实上，它并不是个盒子。“我想可能是金属旅行箱之类的东西。”他告诉零蛋。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Once again he tried pulling it out, but it was firmly in the ground. If he pulled too hard, he feared, he'd cause a cave-in. He knew that when he was ready to pull it out, he would have to do it quickly, before the ground above it collapsed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他再一次试着把盒子拽出来，但它牢牢地插在土里。他担心如果拽得太用力，可能会出现塌方。他明白一旦他准备好了要把盒子拽出来，就必须麻利一点，赶在泥土塌陷之前完成。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Can you pry it loose with the shovel?" Zero suggested.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你能用铲子把它撬松吗？”零蛋建议道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Stanley took a sip of water. "Might as well," he said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯坦利抿了一口水。“那就试试吧。”他说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm afraid the side of the hole will collapse."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我怕洞壁会塌陷。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He forced the tip of the shovel between the dirt and the top of the metal case and tried to wedge it free. He wished he could see what he was doing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他将铲尖插进泥土和金属箱子之间，想把箱子撬松。他希望能看清楚手底下的情况。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He worked the end of the shovel, back and forth, up and down, until he felt the suitcase fall free. Then he felt the dirt come piling down on top of it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他把铲子来来回回上上下下地撬着，终于感到箱子松动了。接着，他发觉泥土正往下落在箱子上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You might as well give it a try," said Zero.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“还是试试看吧。”零蛋说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But it wasn't a huge cave-in. As he knelt down in the hole, he could tell that only a small portion of the earth had collapsed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="幸好塌陷得并不严重。他跪在洞里，确信只落下来不多的一点土。">查看中文翻译</div>
