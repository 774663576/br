<div class="line_en">"I had to follow Petey," Josh explained, still looking very worried. "He just took off. One second he was sniffing around that dead flower bed in our front yard. The next second, he just started to run. He wouldn't stop when I called. Wouldn't even look back. He kept running till he got here. I had to follow. I was afraid he'd get lost."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我一路跟着皮皮，”乔西解释道，看起来还是很担心。“它一声不响就跑了。本来还在院子的花圃那里，一转眼就跑开了。叫它也不停，连头都不回。它一路跑到这里，我只好跟着，怕它丢了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It took Dad a few tries, but he finally managed to grab Petey and pick him up off the ground. Our little terrier gave a halfhearted yelp of protest, then allowed himself to be carried away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爸爸试了几次，终于抓住皮皮，把它抱了起来。皮皮装模做样地叫了几声，以示抗议，然后就老老实实地让爸爸带走了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Petey's never been on a leash," Josh protested, wearily climbing into the backseat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“皮皮从来都不用皮带，”乔西抗议道，然后疲惫地爬进后座。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Josh stopped and gratefully let Dad take over the chase. "I don't know what that dumb dog's problem is," he said to me. "He's just weird."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="乔西停下来，舒了一口气，让爸爸继续追。“不懂这只笨狗到底怎么了，”他对我说，“怪里怪气的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We all trooped back to the car on the side of the road. Mr. Dawes was waiting by the car. "Maybe you'd better get a leash for that dog," he said, looking very concerned.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, we might have to try one for a while," Dad said quietly. "Especially if he keeps running away." Dad tossed Petey into the backseat. The dog eagerly curled up in Josh's arms.</div>

<div class="line_en">The rest of us piled into the car, and Mr. Dawes drove us back to his office, a tiny, white, flat-roofed building at the end of a row of small offices. As we rode, I reached over and stroked the back of Petey's head.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们其他几个人挤进车里，道斯先生把车开回办公室。那是一座白色的平顶小建筑，位于一排小办公室的尽头。路上，我伸过手，不停地摸皮皮的头。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="为什么皮皮会这么跑开？我在想。它以前从没这样过。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I guessed that Petey was also upset about our moving. After all, Petey had spent his whole life in our old house. He probably felt a lot like Josh and I did about having to pack up and move and never see the old neighborhood again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我猜皮皮也是因为要搬家而感到紧张，毕竟它一直都是住在我们的旧房子。马上要卷铺盖离开，一去不复还，它的感受恐怕跟我和乔西一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The new house, the new streets, and all the new smells must have freaked the poor dog out. Josh wanted to run away from the whole idea. And so did Petey.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="新的房子，新的街道，还有新的气味，所有这些使可怜的皮皮行为反常。就像乔西一样，皮皮也在逃避这一切。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mr. Dawes parked the car in front of his tiny office, shook Dad's hand, and gave him a business card. "You can come by next week," he told Mom and Dad. "I'll have all the legal work done by then. After you sign the papers, you can move in anytime."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="道斯先生把车停在办公室前，同爸爸握手，然后递给爸爸一张名片。“你们可以下星期过来，”他对爸爸妈妈说。“到时候，我会把所有的法律手续办完，你们只要签了字，随时都可以搬进去。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mr. Dawes shook his head. "No," he said, "I'm the only Compton in my family. I have no idea where the name comes from. No idea at all. Maybe my parents didn't know how to spell Charlie!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="道斯先生摇了摇头，“不是，”他说。“家里只有我叫康普顿。不知道这个名字是怎么来的，我也很纳闷，也许是我父母想叫我查理，但是不会拼写吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I guess," Josh said without enthusiasm. Petey was sound asleep in his lap, snoring quietly.</div>

<div class="line_en">The next couple of weeks seemed to crawl by. I walked around the house thinking about how I'd never see my room again, how I'd never eat breakfast in this kitchen again, how I'd never watch TV in the living room again. Morbid stuff like that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="随后几个星期的日子似乎是慢慢爬过去的。每天，我在房子里东游西荡，满脑子都是些令人不悦的想法：我再也看不到我的房间了，我再也不能在这个厨房里吃早餐了，我再也不能在这个客厅里看电视了，等等。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I had this sick feeling when the movers came one afternoon and delivered a tall stack of cartons. Time to pack up. It was really happening. Even though it was the middle of the afternoon, I went up to my room and flopped down on my bed. I didn't nap or anything. I just stared at the ceiling for more than an hour, and all these wild, unconnected thoughts ran through my head, like a dream, only I was awake.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一天下午，搬运工来了，送来了一大堆纸箱。我觉得自己都要病了。装箱的时候到了。这一切真的在发生。大下午的我就回到自己的房间，噗地一声倒到床上。我不是去午睡的。我盯着天花板看了一个多小时，萦绕在脑海里的还是那些杂乱无序的想法，仿佛在梦里一般，只是自己依然醒着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I wasn't the only one who was nervous about the move. Mom and Dad were snapping at each other over nothing at all. One morning they had a big fight over whether the bacon was too crispy or not.</div>

<div class="line_en">In a way, it was funny to see them being so childish. Josh was acting really sullen all the time. He hardly spoke a word to anyone. And Petey sulked, too. That dumb dog wouldn't even pick himself up and come over to me when I had some table scraps for him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从某种意义上说，看到他们如此小孩子气，我觉得很好玩。乔西却总是绷着脸，跟谁都不搭腔。皮皮也是闷闷不乐的，我从饭桌上给它拿吃的，它都懒得爬起来过来吃。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I guess the hardest part about moving was saying good-bye to my friends. Carol and Amy were away at camp, so I had to write to them. But Kathy was home, and she was my oldest and best friend, and the hardest to say good-bye to.</div>
