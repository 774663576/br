<div class="line_en">By permitting Lolita to study acting I had, fond fool, suffered her to cultivate deceit. It now appeared that it had not been merely a matter of learning the answers to such questions as what is the basic conflict in "Hedda Gabler," or where are the climaxes in "Love Under the Lindens," or analyze the prevailing mood of "Cherry Orchard"; it was really a matter of learning to betray me. How I deplored now the exercises in sensual simulation that I had so often seen her go through in our Beardsley parlor when I would observe her from some strategic point while she, like a hypnotic subject or a performer in a mystic rite, produced sophisticated versions of infantile make-believe by going through the mimetic actions of hearing a moan in the dark, seeing for the first time a brand new young stepmother, tasting something she hated, such as buttermilk, smelling crushed grass in a lush orchard, or touching mirages of objects with her sly, slender, girl-child hands. Among my papers I still have a mimeographed sheet suggesting:</div>

On certain adventurous evenings, in Beardsley, I also had her dance for me with the promise of some treat or gift, and although these routine leg-parted leaps of hers were more like those of a football cheerleader than like the languorous and jerky motions of a Parisian petit rat, the rhythms of her not quite nubile limbs had given me pleasure.

<div class="line_en">Despite her advanced age, she was more of a nymphet than ever, with her apricot-colored limbs, in her sub-teen tennis togs! Winged gentlemen! No hereafter is acceptable if it does not produce her as she was then, in that Colorado resort between Snow and Elphinstone, with everything right: the white wide little-boy shorts, the slender waist, the apricot midriff, the white breast-kerchief whose ribbons went up and encircled her neck to end behind in a dangling knot leaving bare her gaspingly young and adorable apricot shoulder blades with that pubescence and those lovely gentle bones, and the smooth, downward-tapering back. Her cap had a white peak. Her racket had cost me a small fortune. Idiot, triple idiot! I could have filmed her! I would have had her now with me, before my eyes, in the projection room of my pain and despair!</div>

<div class="line_en">The ball when it entered her aura of control became somehow whiter, its resilience somehow richer, and the instrument of precision she used upon it seemed inordinately prehensile and deliberate at the moment of clinging contact. Her form was, indeed, an absolutely perfect imitation of absolutely top-notch tennis -- without any utilitarian results. As Edusa's sister, Electra Gold, a marvelous young coach, said to me once while I sat on a pulsating hard bench watching Dolores Haze toying with Linda Hall (and being beaten by her): "Dolly has a magnet in the center of her racket guts, but why the heck is she so polite?" Ah, Electra, what did it matter, with such grace! I remember at the very first game I watched being drenched with an almost painful convulsion of beauty assimilation. My Lolita had a way of raising her bent left knee at the ample and springy start of the service cycle when there would develop and hang in the sun for a second a vital web of balance between toed foot, pristine armpit, burnished arm and far back-flung racket, as she smiled up with gleaming teeth at the small globe suspended so high in the zenith of the powerful and graceful cosmos she had created for the express purpose of falling upon it with a clean resounding crack of her golden whip.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那球一进入她的控制范围，不知怎么就白了许多，弹性也更大，而她击球的准确，仿佛是将球吸在了球拍上，又那么从容不迫。她的姿态确实是绝对一流的一一不带任何功利的目的。有一次我坐在晃悠悠的硬板凳上看多洛雷斯·黑兹和林达。霍尔打着玩（并被打败了）时，埃杜萨的姐姐，伊莱克特拉。戈尔德，一位出色的年轻教练这么对我说：“多丽的球拍肠线中间象有块磁铁，不过真见鬼，她干嘛那么客气？”啊，伊莱克特拉，有此美德，又有何妨！我记得我看第一场比赛时，浑身浸透了一种几乎痛苦的被美同化的骚动。我的洛丽塔在发球开始，总是先抬高她弯曲的左膝，而后背衬阳光，让两脚之间，腋窝之间，光滑的手臂和朝后旋开的球拍之间，保持一秒钟充满生命力的蹼平衡姿态，她银牙闪亮，对着抛掷到威严而壮丽的高高苍穹中的小球莞尔一笑，那苍穹是她一手创造，就为的是让她的金鞭在落到球上时发出的那声利索的“叭叭”回响不绝。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">That I could have had all her strokes, all her enchantments, immortalized in segments of celluloid, makes me moan to-day with frustration. They would have been so much more than the snapshots I burned! Her overhead volley was related to her service as the envoy is to the ballade; for she had been trained, my pet, to patter up at once to the net on her nimble, vivid, white-shod feet. There was nothing to choose between her forehand and backhand drives: they were mirror images of one another -- my very loins still tingle with those pistol reports repeated by crisp echoes and Electra's cries. One of the pearls of Dolly's game was a short half-volley that Ned Litam had taught her in California.</div>

<div class="line_en">There was nothing wrong or deceitful in the spirit of her game -- unless one considered her cheerful indifference toward its outcome as the feint of a nymphet. She who was so cruel and crafty in everyday life, revealed an innocence, a frankness, a kindness of ball-placing, that permitted a second-rate but determined player, no matter how uncouth and incompetent, to poke and cut his way to victory. Despite her small stature, she covered the one thousand and fifty-three square feet of her half of the court with wonderful ease, once she had entered into the rhythm of a rally and as long as she could direct that rhythm; but any abrupt attack, or sudden change of tactics on her adversary's part, left her helpless. At match point, her second serve, which -- rather typically -- was even stronger and more stylish than her first (for she had none of the inhibitions that cautious winners have), would strike vibrantly the harp-cord of the net -- and ricochet out of court. The polished gem of her dropshot was snapped up and put away by an opponent who seemed four-legged and wielded a crooked paddle. Her dramatic drives and lovely volleys would candidly fall at his feet. Over and over again she would land an easy one into the net -- and merrily mimic dismay by drooping in a ballet attitude, with her forelocks hanging. So sterile were her grace and whipper that she could not even win from panting me and my old-fashioned lifting drive.</div>

<div class="line_en">I suppose I am especially susceptible to the magic of games. In my chess sessions with Gaston I saw the board as a square pool of limpid water with rare shells and stratagems rosily visible upon the smooth tessellated bottom, which to my confused adversary was all ooze and squid-cloud. Similarly, the initial tennis coaching I had inflicted on Lolita -- prior to the revelations that came to her through the great Californian's lessons -- remained in my mind as oppressive and distressful memories -- not only because she had been so hopelessly and irritatingly irritated by every suggestion of mine -- but because the precious symmetry of the court instead of reflecting the harmonies latent in her was utterly jumbled by the clumsiness and lassitude of the resentful child I mistaught. Now things were different, and on that particular day, in the pure air of Champion, Colorado, on that admirable court at the foot of steep stone stairs leading up to Champion Hotel where we had spent the night, I felt I could rest from the nightmare of unknown betrayals within the innocence of her style, of her soul, of her essential grace.</div>

<div class="line_en">Two people in tennis shorts, a red-haired fellow only about eight years my junior, with sunburnt bright pink shins, and an indolent dark girl with a moody mouth and hard eyes, about two years Lolita's senior, appeared from nowhere. As is common with dutiful tyros, their rackets were sheathed and framed, and they carried them not as if they were the natural and comfortable extensions of certain specialized muscles, but hammers or blunderbusses or wimbles, or my own dreadful cumbersome sins. Rather unceremoniously seating themselves near my precious coat, on a bench adjacent to the court, they fell to admiring very vocally a rally of some fifty exchanges that Lo innocently helped me to foster and uphold -- until there occurred a syncope in the series causing her to gasp as her overhead smash went out of court, whereupon she melted into winsome merriment, my golden pet.</div>

"And that's Fay Page, actress. Maffy On Say"-- he added (pointing with his ridiculously hooded racket at polished Fay who was already talking to Dolly). I was about to reply "Sorry, but --" (for I hate to have my filly involved in the chops and jabs of cheap bunglers), when a remarkably melodious cry diverted my attention: a bellboy was tripping down the steps from the hotel to our court and making me signs. I was wanted, if you please, on an urgent long distance call -- so urgent in fact that the line was being held for me. Certainly. I got into my coat (inside pocket heavy with pistol) and told Lo I would be back in a minute.

<div class="line_en">I folded myself into a booth, took a little pill, and for about twenty minutes tussled with space-spooks. A quartet of propositions gradually became audible: soprano, there was no such number in Beardsley; alto, Miss Pratt was on her way to England; tenor, Beardsley School had not telephoned; bass, they could not have done so, since nobody knew I was, that particular day, in Champion, Colo. Upon my stinging him, the Roman took the trouble to find out if there had been a long distance call. There had been none. A fake call from some local dial was not excluded. I thanked him. He said: You bet. After a visit to the purling men's room and a stiff drink at the bar, I started on my return march. From the very first terrace I saw, far below, on the tennis court which seemed the size of a school child's ill-wiped slate, golden Lolita playing in a double. She moved like a fair angel among three horrible Boschian cripples. One of these, her partner, while changing sides, jocosely slapped her on her behind with his racket. He had a remarkably round head and wore incongruous brown trousers. There was a momentary flurry -- he saw me, and throwing away his racket -- mine!-- scuttled up the slope. He waved his wrists and elbows in would-be comical imitation of rudimentary wings, as he climbed, bow-legged, to the street, where his gray car awaited him. Next moment he and the grayness were gone. When I came down, the remaining trio were collecting and sorting out the balls.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我走进电话亭，吃了几片药，和大气中的幽灵差不多斗争了二十分钟之后，解决问题的四重唱渐渐清晰可闻了：女高音，比尔兹利没有这么个号码；女低音，普拉特小姐正在去英格兰的路上；男高音，比尔兹利学校没打过电话来；男低音，他们不可能这么做，因为谁也不知道我那天恰在科罗拉多州斗士城。经我的追逼，那罗马鼻子只得去查寻是否有长途电话。根本没有。只能是从本城某个自动号码盘打来的，伪称长途电话。我谢过他。他说：好说。我拜访了麦莱酒男士的居室，又到酒吧喝了杯浓酒，就走上回去的路。刚刚下了第一层楼梯，我便看见，远远的底下的网球场看上去就象块小学生乱涂过的石板，镀着金辉的洛丽塔正在那儿打双打。她就象美妙的天使穿梭在三个可怕的笨蛋中间。其中有一人，是她的搭档，换位时，开玩笑似地用球拍朝她的后边拍了一下。他的圆脑袋很突出，穿着与上衣极不相称的褐色裤。突然一瞬间的骚乱——他看见我，扔掉球拍——我的！——快步上了山坡。他摇着手腕和胳膊肘，滑稽地学着早期的飞机模样，弯着腿朝公路上爬去，他的灰色轿车正在那里恭候。一转眼他及他的灰色就无影无踪了。我下来时，剩下的三个人正在收拾，挑捡着球。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At the desk, a dignified, Roman-nosed man, with, I suggest, a very obscure past that might reward investigation, handed me a message in his own hand. The line had not been held after all. The note said: "Mr. Humbert. The head of Birdsley (sic!) School called. Summer residence -- Birdsley 2-8282. Please call back immediately. Highly important."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到了柜台边，一位严肃正经、长着罗马鼻的男士递给我一张纸条。我暗想，他的过去可能是隐晦的，专事奖励调查研究的。电话还是接断了。字条上写着：“亨伯特先生。博尔兹利（原文如此！）学校校长打来电话。夏季别墅——博尔兹利2—8282。请马上回电。万分重要。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Speaking as if it really did not really matter, and assuming, apparently, that life was automatically rolling on with all its routine pleasures, Lolita said she would like to change into her bathing things, and spend the rest of the afternoon at the swimming pool. It was a gorgeous day. Lolita!</div>

<div class="line_en">Dolly. The handle of my racket was still disgustingly warm. Before returning to the hotel, I ushered her into a little alley half-smothered in fragrant shrubs, with flowers like smoke, and was about to burst into ripe sobs and plead with her imperturbed dream in the most abject manner for clarification, no matter how meretricious, of the slow awfulness enveloping me, when we found ourselves behind the convulsed Mead twosome -- assorted people, you know, meeting among idyllic settings in old comedies. Bill and Fay were both weak with laughter -- we had come at the end of their private joke. It did not really matter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="多丽。我球拍的把儿还是温热的，令人恶心。回饭店之前，我领她进到一条小路，小路被芳香的灌木覆盖着，鲜花象烟雾一样，我刚要发泄一场酝酿成熟的大哭，并以最卑屈的态度祈求她澄清一切缠绕我身边的尴尬事；这时我突然发现我们就在米德二人身后——匹配的人，你知道，在旧式喜剧里总在很抒情的情致中相会。比尔和费伊都笑得有气无力——我们终于成了他们的秘密笑柄。不过确实无关紧要！">查看中文翻译</div>
