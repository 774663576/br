<div class="line_en">Before that day when the dour and slightly fumbling boy with the muscular body and the sad blue eyes sat down beside Sonja on the train, there were really only three things she loved unconditionally in her life: books, her father, and cats.</div>

<div class="line_en">She'd obviously had quite a lot of attention, it wasn't that. The suitors had come in all shapes and sizes. Tall and dark or short and blond and fun-loving and dull and elegant and boastful and handsome and greedy, and if they hadn't been slightly dissuaded by the stories in the village of Sonja's father keeping one or two firearms in the isolated wooden house out there in the woods, they would most likely have been a bit pushier. But none of them had looked at her the way that boy looked at her when he sat down beside her on the train. As if she were the only girl in the world.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sometimes, especially in the first few years, some of her girlfriends questioned the choice she had made. Sonja was very beautiful, as the people around her seemed to find it so important to keep telling her. Furthermore she loved to laugh and, whatever life threw at her, she was the sort of person who took a positive view of it. But Ove was, well, Ove was Ove. Something the people around her also kept telling Sonja. He'd been a grumpy old man since he started elementary school, they insisted. And she could have someone so much better.</div>

<div class="line_en">But to Sonja, Ove was never dour and awkward and sharp-edged. To her, he was the slightly disheveled pink flowers at their first dinner. He was his father's slightly too tight-fitting brown suit across his broad, sad shoulders. He believed so strongly in things: justice and fair play and hard work and a world where right just had to be right. Not so one could get a medal or a diploma or a slap on the back for it, but just because that was how it was supposed to be. Not many men of his kind were made anymore, Sonja had understood. So she was holding on to this one. Maybe he didn't write her poems or serenade her with songs or come home with expensive gifts. But no other boy had gone the wrong way on the train for hours every day just because he liked sitting next to her while she spoke.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但对索雅来说，欧维从来都不阴沉、不尖锐，也不刻薄。对她来说，他就是他们第一次共进晚餐时那些有点褶皱的粉红色玫瑰。他把他爸爸有些紧身的棕色西装套在了自己宽阔的肩膀上。他对正义、道德、勤劳以及一个对错分明的世界深信不疑。并不是因为这样的人会赢得奖牌或证书，或者会被别人拍拍肩膀说声好样的，而是这样处世的人不多了，索雅知道。所以她想守住这个人。他或许不为她吟诗、唱夜曲，也从来没有送过她昂贵的礼物，但从来没有别的男孩就因为喜欢坐在她身边听她说话而愿意反方向坐几个小时火车。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And when she took hold of his lower arm, thick as her thigh, and tickled him until that sulky boy's face opened up in a smile, it was like a plaster cast cracking around a piece of jewelry, and when this happened it was as if something started singing inside Sonja. And they belonged only to her, those moments.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她抚着他那比她的大腿还粗的小臂，胳肢他，直到这个顽固的男孩露出笑容，就像包裹在珠宝周围的石膏模具碎裂开来，这时索雅心里就会唱起歌来。这些时刻，只属于她一个人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In their almost four decades together Sonja taught hundreds of pupils with learning difficulties to read and write, and she got them to read Shakespeare's collected works. In the same period she never managed to make Ove read a single Shakespeare play. But as soon as they moved into their row house he spent every evening for weeks on end in the toolshed. And when he was done, the most beautiful bookcases she had ever seen were in their living room.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ove did not meet Sonja's father more times than he could count on his fingers.

<div class="line_en">Ernest was the biggest farm cat in the world. When Sonja was small she actually thought he was a pony. He came and went in her father's house as he pleased, but he didn't live there. Where he lived, in fact, was not known to anyone. Sonja named him Ernest after Ernest Hemingway. Her father had never bothered with books, but when his daughter sat reading the newspaper at the age of five he wasn't so stupid that he tried to avoid doing something about it. "A girl can't read shit like that: she'll lose her head," he stated as he pushed her towards the library counter in the village. The old librarian didn't quite know what he meant by that, but there was no doubt about the girl's quite outstanding intellect.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sonja moved to the local town when she started studying for her upper secondary examinations -- all in humanities subjects -- at a sixth-form college. Her father looked at her with boundless indignation when she suggested that he might like to come with her. "What can I do there? Meet folk?" he growled. He always spoke the word "folk" as if it were a swear word. So Sonja let him be. Apart from her weekend visits and his monthly trip in the truck to the grocery store in the nearest village, he only had Ernest for company.</div>

<div class="line_en">The monthly trip to the grocery store simply had to be extended to a monthly trip to the library, the librarian and father decided together, without any particular need to discuss it further. By the time Sonja passed her twelfth birthday she had read all the books at least twice. The ones she liked, such as The Old Man and the Sea, she'd read so many times that she'd lost count.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后，每月一次的杂货采购就多了去图书馆一项，这是图书馆管理员和爸爸共同的决定，没什么需要商量的。索雅十二岁的时候，那里所有的书至少都读了两遍。她喜欢的那些，例如《老人与海》，她自己都数不清究竟读了多少遍。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So Ernest ended up being called Ernest. And no one owned him. He didn't talk, but he liked to go fishing with her father, who appreciated his qualities. They would share the catch equally once they got home.</div>

<div class="line_en">The first time Sonja brought Ove out to the old wooden house in the forest, Ove and her father sat in buttoned-up silence opposite each other, staring down at their food for almost an hour, while she tried to encourage some form of civilized conversation. Neither of the men could quite understand what they were doing there, apart from the fact that it was important to the only woman either of them cared about. They had both protested about the whole arrangement, insistently and vociferously, but without success.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sonja's father was negatively disposed from the very beginning. All he knew about this boy was that he came from town and that Sonja had mentioned that he did not like cats very much. These were two characteristics, as far as he was concerned, that gave him reason enough to view Ove as unreliable.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="索雅的爸爸一开始就有偏见，他对这个男孩的唯一了解，就是他从城里来，而且索雅还提到过他不是很喜欢猫。这两点足以让索雅的爸爸认为欧维不可靠。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As for Ove, he felt he was at a job interview, and he had never been very good at that sort of thing. So when Sonja wasn't talking, which admittedly she did almost all of the time, there was a sort of silence in the room that can only arise between a man who does not want to lose his daughter and a man who has not yet completely understood that he has been chosen to take her away from there. Finally Sonja kicked Ove's shinbone to make him say something. Ove looked up from his plate and noted the angry twitches around the edges of her eyes. He cleared his throat and looked around with a certain desperation to find something to ask this old man about. Because this was what Ove had learned: if one didn't have anything to say, one had to find something to ask. If there was one thing that made people forget to dislike one, it was when they were given the opportunity to talk about themselves.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="至于欧维，他觉得自己是来参加应聘面试的，他从来就不喜欢面试。所以索雅不说话的时候——必须承认她经常这么做——房间里就陷入一种只会发生在一个不愿意离开自己女儿的男人和另一个还不知道自己命中注定会把她带走的男人之间的沉默。最后索雅只好踹欧维的小腿让他开口。欧维吃惊地从自己的盘子上抬起视线，注意到她双眼之间愤怒的褶皱。他清清嗓子，绝望地环顾四周，想找些问题来问老爷子。这是欧维学来的，要是找不到话说，提问是最好的方式。要是有什么方法能让人放下敌意，那就是给他们机会自夸一下。">查看中文翻译</div>
