<div class="line_en">Funny to think that the course of my existence hung like a thread upon that quality of hers. Her curiosity was a disease, almost a mania. At first I had been shocked, wretchedly embarrassed; I would feel like a whipping boy who must bear his master's pains when I watched people laugh behind her back, leave a room hurriedly upon her entrance, or even vanish behind a Service door on the corridor upstairs. For many years now she had come to the Hotel Cote d'Azur, and, apart from bridge, her one pastime which was notorious by now in Monte Carlo, was to claim visitors of distinction as her friends had she but seen them once at the other end of the post-office. Somehow she would manage to introduce herself, and before her victim had scented danger she had proffered an invitation to her suite. Her method of attack was so downright and sudden that there was seldom opportunity to escape. At the Cote d'Azur she staked a claim upon a certain sofa in the lounge, midway between the reception hall and the passage to the restaurant, and she would have her coffee there after luncheon and dinner, and all who came and went must pass her by. Sometimes she would employ me as a bait to draw her prey, and, hating my errand, I would be sent across the lounge with a verbal message, the loan of a book or paper, the address of some shop or other, the sudden discovery of a mutual friend. It seemed as though notables must be fed to her, much as invalids are spooned their jelly; and though titles were preferred by her, any face once seen in a social paper served as well. Names scattered in a gossip column, authors, artists, actors, and their kind, even the mediocre ones, as long as she had learnt of them in print.</div>

<div class="line_en">I saw then that her plans were formed, and the nephew was to be the means of introduction. Not for the first time I resented the part that I must play in her schemes. Like a juggler's assistant I produced the props, then silent and attentive I waited on my cue. This newcomer would not welcome intrusion, I felt certain of that. In the little I had learnt of him at luncheon, a smattering of hearsay garnered by her ten months ago from the daily papers and stored in her memory for future use, I could imagine, in spite of my youth and inexperience of the world, that he would resent this sudden bursting in upon his solitude. Why he should have chosen to come to the Cote d'Azur at Monte Carlo was not our concern, his problems were his own, and anyone but Mrs Van Hopper would have understood. Tact was a quality unknown to her, discretion too, and because gossip was the breath of life to her this stranger must be served for her dissection. I found the letter in a pigeon-hole in her desk, and hesitated a moment before going down again to the lounge.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我知道她的计划已拟订就绪，准备用外甥来作媒介了。我讨厌自己非得在她的诡计中扮演这样的角色。这也不是第一回了。我就像一个耍戏法的副手，专在一旁把小道具递上去，此后就一声不吭，全神贯注地等待主人给我暗示。这位新来的客人不喜欢别人打扰，这点我敢肯定。十个月以前，她从几份日报上搜罗了有关此人的零星的流言蜚语，一直把它贮藏在记忆中，以为将来之用。吃午饭时她曾对我说了一鳞半爪。尽管我还年轻，不识世故，但从这些片言只语中我想象得出，他一定讨厌别人突如其来地闯来打扰。他为什么选中蒙特卡洛的“蔚蓝海岸”，到这儿来，这与我们毫不相干。他有自己的心事，这些心事别人不可能理解；当然，只有范—霍珀夫人是例外。这位夫人从来不懂得怎样处世才得体，也不讲究谨慎行事，飞短流长倒是她生活里须臾不可缺的。因此，这位陌生人必须经她细加剖析。我在她书桌的鸽笼式文件分类架上找着了那封信，在下楼回到休息室前犹豫了一会儿。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I can see her as though it were but yesterday, on that unforgettable afternoon -- never mind how many years ago -- when she sat at her favourite sofa in the lounge, debating her method of attack. I could tell by her abrupt manner, and the way she tapped her lorgnette against her teeth, that she was questing possibilities. I knew, too, when she had missed the sweet and rushed through dessert, that she had wished to finish luncheon before the new arrival and so install herself where he must pass. Suddenly she turned to me, her small eyes alight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="时至今日，我仍可以忆起她在那个难忘的下午——且别管是多少年之前——的样子，仿佛这只是昨天的事。她坐在休息室那张特别中意的沙发上，盘算着进攻的手法；从她仓促张皇的神态，甚至还用夹鼻眼镜轻叩牙齿，我看得出来她正在煞费苦心。她匆匆吃完餐后水果，没来得及用那道甜食，从这一点，我就知道她想在这位客人之前吃完午饭，以便安坐在他必经之路上守候。突然间，她转身向我，小眼睛闪着光，说道：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I wished I had the courage to go by the Service staircase and so by roundabout way to the restaurant, and there warn him of the ambush. Convention was too strong for me though, nor did I know how I should frame my sentence. There was nothing for it but to sit in my usual place beside Mrs Van Hopper while she, like a large, complacent spider, spun her wide net of tedium about the stranger's person.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我多希望自己有勇气从侍者专用楼梯下去，绕个圈子，跑到餐厅去告诉他有人埋伏着等候他。但是，社会礼俗对我束缚至深；再说，我也不知道该如何对他说才好。所以我只有坐到范—霍珀夫人旁边那只通常由我占坐的座位上去，任她像一只得意的大蜘蛛似地编织那令人讨厌的大网，去纠缠那陌生人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Mr de Winter is having coffee with us, go and ask the waiter for another cup," she said, her tone just casual enough to warn him of my footing. It meant I was a youthful thing and unimportant, and that there was no need to include me in the conversation. She always spoke in that tone when she wished to be impressive, and her method of introduction was a form of self-protection, for once I had been taken for her daughter, an acute embarrassment for us both. This abruptness showed that I could safely be ignored, and women would give me a brief nod which served as a greeting and a dismissal in one, while men, with large relief, would realize they could sink back into a comfortable chair without offending courtesy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“德温特先生与我们一起用咖啡。去对侍者说再端一杯来。”她说话的语气非常之简慢，以让他知道我的地位。她的意思是说，我是个无足轻重的小妞儿，谈话时大可不必顾及。每当她炫耀自己时，总是用这种语气说话；而她把我介绍于人的方法也是一种自我护卫，因为有一次我竟被人误认为她的女儿，两人同时感到莫大的窘迫。她这种无礼的样子告诉人们：可以把我撇在一边而毫无关系。于是太太们向我略一点头，既算是打招呼，同时又是遣我走开的意思；男客则大大松一口气，知道他们可以重新舒舒服服地就座，而不必有失礼的顾虑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I had been longer than I thought, for when I returned to the lounge I saw he had already left the dining-room, and she, fearful of losing him, had not waited for the letter, but had risked a bare-faced introduction on her own. He was even now sitting beside her on the sofa. I walked across to them, and gave her the letter without a word. He rose to his feet at once, while Mrs Van Hopper, flushed with her success, waved a vague hand in my direction and mumbled my name.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我走开的时间比我想象的要长些。等我口到休息室，他已离开餐厅，而她则担心对象溜走，来不及等我取了信来，已经厚着脸皮另外设法作了自我介绍，此刻他竟已坐在她身边的沙发上了。我穿过大厅向他们走去，一言不发地把信递给她。他立刻站起身来。范—霍珀夫人因为自己计谋得逞兴奋得满面红光，她朝我这个方向胡乱地挥挥手，含糊不清地介绍了我的名字。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For a moment she looked annoyed -- this was not what she had intended -- but she soon composed her face, and thrusting her large self between me and the table she leant forward to his chair, talking eagerly and loudly, fluttering the letter in her hand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="好一会儿，她看上去有点不高兴，因为这不符合她原先的设想，但过后马上又眉飞色舞了，把她肥大的身子横插在茶几与我的中间，俯身向着他的椅子，大声唠叨，手里则挥舞着那封信：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm afraid I must contradict you," he said to her, "you are both having coffee with me"; and before I knew what had happened he was sitting in my usual hard chair, and I was on the sofa beside Mrs Van Hopper.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“恐怕我非得同您抵触一下不可，”他对她说。“是你们二位同我一道用咖啡。”还没等我发现是怎么回事，他已坐在通常总由我占坐的硬椅上，而我却已坐在范—霍珀夫人身边的沙发里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You know I recognized you just as soon as you walked into the restaurant," she said, "and I thought, 'Why, there's Mr de Winter, Billy's friend, I simply must show him those snaps of Billy and his bride taken on their honeymoon', and here they are. There's Dora. Isn't she just adorable? That little, slim waist, those great big eyes. Here they are sun-bathing at Palm Beach. Billy is crazy about her, you can imagine. He had not met her of course when he gave that party at Claridge's, and where I saw you first. But I dare say you don't remember an old woman like me?" This with a provocative glance and a gleam of teeth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你知道，你一进餐厅我就认出你了，我想：‘咦，这不是德温特先生，不是比尔的朋友吗？我一定要把比尔和他新娘度蜜月时拍的照片拿给他瞧瞧。’呶，就是这些照片。这是朵拉，真是个尤物，对吗？瞧她那杨柳细腰，那一对大杏眼。这是他们在棕榈海湾晒日光浴。你可以想象得到，比尔爱她简直爱得发疯了。当然，比尔在奇拉里奇大饭店请客那当儿，还没认识她呢！就在那次宴会上我第一次见到你。不过，我敢说，你决不会记得我这样一个老太婆的。”一边说，一边挑逗地飞眼，还把闪闪发光的牙齿露出来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"On the contrary I remember you very well," he said, and before she could trap him into a resurrection of their first meeting he had handed her his cigarette case, and the business of lighting-up stalled her for the moment. "I don't think I should care for Palm Beach," he said, blowing the match, and glancing at him I thought how unreal he would look against a Florida background. He belonged to a walled city of the fifteenth century, a city of narrow, cobbled streets, and thin spires, where the inhabitants wore pointed shoes and worsted hose. His face was arresting, sensitive, medieval in some strange inexplicable way, and I was reminded of a portrait seen in a gallery, I had forgotten where, of a certain Gentleman Unknown. Could one but rob him of his English tweeds, and put him in black, with lace at his throat and wrists, he would stare down at us in our new world from a long-distant past -- a past where men walked cloaked at night, and stood in the shadow of old doorways, a past of narrow stairways and dim dungeons, a past of whispers in the dark, of shimmering rapier blades, of silent, exquisite courtesy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“恰恰相反，我清楚地记得您，”他说，接着，还没等她来得及布下圈套来扯着她没完没了地回忆第一次会面的情景，他已把烟盒递过去，擦火点烟使她一时无法开口。“我并不喜欢棕榈海滩，”他一边说，一边吹熄火柴。我扫了他一眼，觉得他如果出现在佛罗里达州的背景之前，一定得非常不协调。他应当属于十五世纪颓垣围着的那些城市，城里有狭窄的、鹅卵石铺成的街道和细长的尖塔，居民都穿着尖头鞋和长统的绒线袜。他的面容非常吸引人，很敏感，神奇而不可思议地带着中世纪的味道。我看着他就想起在一个什么地方画展里曾见到过的一幅画像，某位无名绅士的画像。只要有人剥去他那身英国式的花呢服装，给他穿上黑衣服，领口和袖口都镶上花边，他就会从一个遥远的古代，凝视着我们这些生活在现代世界的人。在那遥远的古代，绅士们披着大氅在黑夜里行走，站在古老门庭的阴影里；狭窄的梯级，阴暗的地牢，漆黑之中的低语声，剑的闪光，还有那种无言的优雅礼仪。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She shrugged her shoulders, blowing a great cloud of cigarette smoke into the air. I don't think she understood him for a moment. "I'm faithful to Monte," she told him; "the English winter gets me down, and my constitution just won't stand it. What brings you here? You're not one of the regulars.

"Of course you miss the fogs at Manderley; it's quite another matter; the west country must be delightful in the spring." He reached for the ashtray, squashing his cigarette, and I noticed the subtle change in his eyes, the indefinable something that lingered there, momentarily, and I felt I had looked upon something personal to himself with which I had no concern.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他自己的这几句话一定震动了某种回忆，他的脸色又阴沉下来，并微微皱起眉头。她却依然无动于衷地絮叨不休。“自然你会怀恋曼陀丽的浓雾，这完全是另外一种景象。西部农村在春天一定是令人心旷神信的。”他把手伸向烟灰碟，捻熄了香烟。我注意到他的眼神有一种微妙的变化，有一种无法确切描写的东西在那儿游移了片刻；我似乎看到了他的某种隐私，可这又与我何千？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A silence fell upon us during a moment or two, a silence that brought something of discomfort in its train, and stealing a glance at him I was reminded more than ever of my Gentleman Unknown who, cloaked and secret, walked a corridor by night. Mrs Van Hopper's voice pierced my dream like an electric bell.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着大家都沉默了，继沉默之后是难堪。我偷偷看他一眼，不禁更清晰地联想到我那位无名绅士：披着大氅，行踪诡秘，黑夜中在回廊里踯躅。是范—霍珀夫人的声音，电铃似地撕裂了我的幻想。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I suppose you know a crowd of people here, though I must say Monte is very dull this winter. One sees so few well-known faces. The Duke of Middlesex is here in his yacht, but I haven't been aboard yet." She never had, to my knowledge. "You know Nell Middlesex of course," she went on. "What a charmer she is. They always say that second child isn't his, but I don't believe it. People will say anything, won't they, when a woman is attractive? And she is so very lovely. Tell me, is it true the Caxton-Hyslop marriage is not a success?" She ran on, through a tangled fringe of gossip, never seeing that these names were alien to him, they meant nothing, and that as she prattled unaware he grew colder and more silent. Never for a moment did he interrupt or glance at his watch; it was as though he had set himself a standard of behaviour, since the original lapse when he had made a fool of her in front of me, and clung to it grimly rather than offend again. It was a page-boy in the end who released him, with the news that a dressmaker awaited Mrs Van Hopper in the suite.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我想你在这儿一定认识不少人，不过今年冬天蒙特卡洛比较乏味，碰不到几位名人。米德尔塞克斯公爵在这儿，住在自己的游艇上。我还没来得及上游艇去看望他呢！（据我所知，她从来没有上过那游艇。）你自然认识芮尔—米德尔塞克斯罗。真是个迷人的尤物！人家总说第二个孩子不是公爵生的，我可不相信。一个女人长得好，别人就爱说些闲话，对吗？而她恰恰是如此付人喜欢。卡克斯顿与希斯洛普婚后关系不好，是真的吗？”她不住地唠叨，都是些东拉西扯、乱七八糟的流言蜚语，始终没有意识到这些名字对他是完全陌生、毫无意义的。她也没注意到，自己越是不顾对方的反应，一味信口雌黄，对方就越是冷淡，话也说得更少了。但他从不打断她，也不看手表，似乎从他当着我的面出了她的洋相，犯了个最初的错误后，他已经为自己规定了一种行为的准则，要不折不扣地按准则行事，而不愿再冒犯别人了。最后，一个传呼旅客的侍者跑来说有一名裁缝在房间里等候范—霍珀夫人，才算替他解了围。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I knelt on the window-seat and looked out upon the afternoon. The sun shone very brightly still, and there was a gay high wind. In half an hour we should be sitting to our bridge, the windows tightly closed, the central heating turned to the full. I thought of the ashtrays I would have to clear, and how the squashed stubs, stained with lipstick, would sprawl in company with discarded chocolate creams. Bridge does not come easily to a mind brought up on Snap and Happy Families; besides, it bored her friends to play with me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我跪在临窗的椅子上，观看午后的街景。阳光灿烂，一阵大风欢快地吹着。半小时之内，我们又要坐下打桥牌了。窗户紧闭，热水河开得足足的。我想到了总要我去收拾烟灰碟，乱七八糟地堆满染着唇膏的捻扁的烟蒂和丢弃的奶油巧克力糖。我的智力是在学习快照摄影，学习如何组织美满家庭的过程中发展起来的。这样的头脑很难适应桥牌这玩意儿；再说，她的朋友们也不耐烦同我一道打牌。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The lift stopped with a jerk. We arrived at our floor. The page-boy flung open the gates. "By the way, dear," she said, as we walked along the corridor, "don't think I mean to be unkind, but you put yourself just a teeny bit forward this afternoon. Your efforts to monopolize the conversation quite embarrassed me, and I'm sure it did him. Men loathe that sort of thing."</div>

<div class="line_en">I sighed, and turned away from the window. The sun was so full of promise, and the sea was whipped white with a merry wind. I thought of that corner of Monaco which I had passed a day or two ago, and where a crooked house leant to a cobbled square. High up in the tumbled roof there was a window, narrow as a slit. It might have held a presence medieval; and, reaching to the desk for pencil and paper, I sketched in fancy with an absent mind a profile, pale and aquiline. A sombre eye, a high-bridged nose, a scornful upper lip. And I added a pointed beard and lace at the throat, as the painter had done, long ago in a different time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我叹了口气，从窗口回转身来。阳光充满着希望；大海在劲吹的风中掀起白浪。我想起一两天前曾路经的摩纳哥，那儿的某个街角有一座歪斜的房屋，弯身倾向鹅卵石铺成的广场。在高高的倾圮的屋顶处，有一个狭缝似的窗口，这窗子背后也许曾住过中世纪的古人吧。从书桌上拿起铅笔和纸，我心不在焉地画了起来，全凭想象画出一幅苍白的、带鹰钩鼻的侧面头像，阴郁的眼睛，一道高鼻梁，挂着嘲笑的上唇。接着我又给画中人加了一撮尖尖的胡须，领口处镶上花边，就像那位大师在许久以前一个逝去了年代中所画的一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
