<div class="line_en">Harry thought of A History of Magic; the graveyard was supposed to be haunted: what if --? But then he heard a rustle and saw a little eddy of dislodged snow in the bush to which Hermione had pointed. Ghosts could not move snow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利想到了《魔法史》，那上面说墓地里闹鬼：要是——？这时他听到一阵窸窣声，并看见赫敏所指的灌木丛间有一小团雪花的漩涡，鬼是不能移动雪的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They stood quite still, holding on to each other, gazing at the dense black boundary of the graveyard. Harry could not see anything.</div>

<div class="line_en">They glanced back repeatedly as they made their way out of the graveyard. Harry, who did not feel as sanguine as he had pretended when reassuring Hermione, was glad to reach the gate and the slippery pavement. They pulled the Invisibility Cloak back over themselves. The pub was fuller than before: Many voices inside it were now singing the carol that they had heard as they approached the church. For a moment Harry considered suggesting they take refuge inside it, but before he could say anything Hermione murmured, "Let's go this way," and pulled him down the dark street leading out of the village in the opposite direction from which they had entered. Harry could make out the point where the cottages ended and the lane turned into open country again. They walked as quickly as they dared, past more windows sparkling with multicolored lights, the outlines of Christmas trees dark through the curtains.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两人不住地回头看着，往墓地外走去。哈利其实并不像安慰赫敏时那样乐观，走到门口，踏上了滑溜溜的石板路，他感到松了口气。两人披上了隐形衣酒吧里的客人比先前多了，许多声音在唱他们在教堂前听到的颂歌。哈利想提议进去躲一躲，但没等说话，赫敏就悄声说“走这边”，拉着他走上了一条黑暗的街道。它通往村外，与他们进来的路正好相反。哈利能看到房子消失、小街又转为旷野的地方。他们步子快到不敢再快，经过了更多彩灯闪烁的窗口，窗帘后现出圣诞树的剪影。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She tugged at his arm, but Harry was not paying attention. He was looking toward the dark mass that stood at the very end of this row of houses. Next moment he had sped up, dragging Hermione along with him; she slipped a little on the ice.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“为什么没有人重修它呢？”赫敏小声说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He could see it; the Fidelius Charm must have died with James and Lily. The hedge had grown wild in the sixteen years since Hagrid had taken Harry from the rubble that lay scattered amongst the waist-high grass. Most of the cottage was still standing, though entirely covered in dark ivy and snow, but the right side of the top floor had been blown apart; that, Harry was sure, was where the curse had backfired. He and Hermione stood at the gate, gazing up at the wreck of what must once have been a cottage just like those that flanked it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他看到了。赤胆忠心咒一定是随詹姆和莉莉之死而失效了。在海格把哈利从废墟中抱走后的十六年中，树篱已经长得乱七八糟，瓦砾埋藏在齐腰深的荒草间。房子的大部分还立在那里，完全覆在沉黑的常春藤和积雪之下，但顶层房间的右侧被炸毁了，哈利想那一定就是咒语弹回的地方。他和赫敏站在门口瞻仰着这座废墟，从前它想必和两边的房子一样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He did not need Hermione's pinch to his arm. There was next to no chance that this woman was a Muggle: She was standing there gazing at a house that ought to have been completely invisible to her, if she was not a witch. Even assuming that she was a witch, however, it was odd behavior to come out on a night this cold, simply to look at an old ruin. By all the rules of normal magic, meanwhile, she ought not to be able to see Hermione and him at all. Nevertheless, Harry had the strangest feeling that she knew that they were there, and also who they were. Just as he had reached this uneasy conclusion, she raised a gloved hand and beckoned.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不需要赫敏掐他的胳膊，这女人是麻瓜的可能性几乎为零：她站在那儿凝视着一座非巫师完全看不见的房子。但就算她是女巫也够怪的，在这么寒冷的夜晚跑出来，就为看一座老屋的废墟。而且，按照魔法常规来说，她应该根本就看不到他和赫敏。哈利有一种非常奇怪的感觉，好像她知道他们在这儿，而且知道他们是谁。正当他得出这一令人不安的结论时，那女人举起一只戴手套的手，招了一下。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But Harry beamed at her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但哈利朝他开朗地一笑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He broke off. A heavily muffled figure was hobbling up the lane toward them, silhouetted by the bright lights in the distant square. Harry thought, though it was hard to judge, that the figure was a woman. She was moving slowly, possibly frightened of slipping on the snowy ground. Her stoop, her stoutness, her shuffling gait all gave an impression of extreme age. They watched in silence as she drew nearer. Harry was waiting to see whether she would turn into any of the cottages she was passing, but he knew instinctively that she would not. At last she came to a halt a few yards from them and simply stood there in the middle of the frozen road, facing them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他顿住了，一个裹得严严实实的人影从小街上蹒跚走来，被远处广场的灯光映出黑色的轮廓。虽然很难判断，但哈利觉得那是个女人。她走得很慢，也许是怕在雪地上滑倒。那佝偻的身子、臃肿的体态、蹒跚的步伐，都给人以年纪很老的印象。他们默默地看着她走近，哈利等着看她会不会拐进路旁哪所小房子里，但又本能地知道不会。最后，她在几米远外停住了，就那样站在冰冻的街道中央，面朝着他们。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Was it possible that she had been waiting for them all these long months? That Dumbledore had told her to wait, and that Harry would come in the end? Was it not likely that it was she who had moved in the shadows in the graveyard and had followed them to this spot? Even her ability to sense them suggested some Dumbledore-ish power that he had never encountered before.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她会不会这几个月一直在等待他们的到来？是不是邓布利多叫她在这里等候，说哈利总有一天会来的？会不会就是她在墓地里暗中窥视，又尾随至此？而且她能感觉到他们，这一点也令他想起某种他从未遇见过的、邓布利多式的法力。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="赫敏在隐形衣下哈利靠了靠，手臂紧贴着他的手臂。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He shook his head. The woman beckoned again, more vigorously. Harry could think of many reasons not to obey the summons, and yet his suspicions about her identity were growing stronger every moment that they stood facing each other in the deserted street.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他摇摇头。那女人又更起劲地招了招手。哈利能想出许多理由不听从这召唤，但双方在空荡荡的街道上对视时，他对她身份的猜测越来越强烈了。">查看中文翻译</div>

She fumbled for a moment with a key at the front door, then opened it and stepped back to let them pass.</div>

<div class="line_en">The odor of old age, of dust, of unwashed clothes and stale food intensified as she unwound a moth-eaten black shawl, revealing a head of scant white hair through which the scalp showed clearly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="陈年的霉味、灰尘味、脏衣服味和变质食品味更加浓烈了，她解开霉蛀的黑头巾，露出一个白发稀疏、头发清晰可见的脑袋。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She smelled bad, or perhaps it was her house: Harry wrinkled his nose as they sidled past her and pulled off the Cloak. Now that he was beside her, he realized how tiny she was; bowed down with age, she came barely level with his chest. She closed the door behind them, her knuckles blue and mottled against the peeling paint, then turned and peered into Harry's face. Her eyes were thick with cataracts and sunken into folds of transparent skin, and her whole face was dotted with broken veins and liver spots. He wondered whether she could make him out at all; even if she could, it was the balding Muggle whose identity he had stolen that she would see.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她身上的味道很难闻，或者是她的屋子：他们侧身进门，脱下隐形衣时，哈利皱起了鼻子。他站到她的近旁，发现她是那么矮小，老得都佝偻了，刚刚到他胸口。她关上门，青紫带斑的指节衬在剥落的油漆上，然后转身注视着哈利的面庞，眼睛深陷在透明的皮肤皱褶中，里面是厚厚的白内障。她的脸布满断断续续的血管和老人班。他怀疑老太太能不能看得清，就算能，也只会看见他冒充的那个秃顶麻瓜。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She nodded again. Harry became aware of the locket against his skin; the thing inside it that sometimes ticked or beat had woken; he could feel it pulsing through the cold gold. Did it know, could it sense, that the thing that would destroy it was near?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她再次点点头。哈利感觉到挂坠盒贴在他的皮肤上，里面那个有时滴滴答答或轻轻跳动的东西醒来了，他能感到它在冰冷的金壳里面搏动。它是否知道，是否感觉到，那个能够摧毁它的东西就在附近？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Bathilda was tottering around the place lighting candles, but it was still very dark, not to mention extremely dirty. Thick dust crunched beneath their feet, and Harry's nose detected, underneath the dank and mildewed smell, something worse, like meat gone bad. He wondered when was the last time anyone had been inside Bathilda's house to check whether she was coping. She seemed to have forgotten that she could do magic, too, for she lit the candles clumsily by hand, her trailing lace cuff in constant danger of catching fire.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="巴希达蹒跚地走来走去点蜡烛，但屋里仍然很昏暗，更不用说有多脏了。厚厚的灰尘在他们脚下噗噗作响，哈利的鼻子在霉湿的气味下闻到了更恶心的东西，好像是腐肉。他想，不知道上一次是何时曾经有人走进巴希达的屋子，看看她是否还活着。她似乎已经忘记自己会魔法，在笨拙地用手点蜡烛，袖子上的花边随时都有着火的危险。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Let me do that," offered Harry, and he took the matches from her. She stood watching him as he finished lighting the candle stubs that stood on saucers around the room, perched precariously on stacks of books and on side tables crammed with cracked and moldy cups.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我来吧。”哈利说，从她手里接过火柴。她站在那儿看着他点完屋里各处的蜡烛，它们竖在小碟子上，危险地顶在书堆上或是放满了发霉的破杯子的小桌上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The last surface on which Harry spotted a candle was a bowfronted chest of drawers on which there stood a large number of photographs. When the flame danced into life, its reflection wavered on their dusty glass and silver. He saw a few tiny movements from the pictures. As Bathilda fumbled with logs for the fire, he muttered "Tergeo": The dust vanished from the photographs, and he saw at once that half a dozen were missing from the largest and most ornate frames. He wondered whether Bathilda or somebody else had removed them. Then the sight of a photograph near the back of the collection caught his eye, and he snatched it up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利看到有蜡烛的最后一个地方是一个弓形五斗橱，上面摆着好多照片。火苗跳跃起来之后，反光在灰蒙蒙的玻璃和银框中闪动。他看到照片中隐隐有东西在动。巴希达摸索着搬木头生火时，他轻轻说了声：“旋风扫净。”灰尘从照片上消失了，他马上看出少了六七张照片，那是最高、最华丽的像框中的，不知道是巴希达还是别人把它们拿走了。这时，靠后面的一张照片吸引了他的目光，他把它拿了起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
