<div class="line_en">Finally, the truth. Lying with his face pressed into the dusty carpet of the office where he had once thought he was learning the secrets of victory, Harry understood at last that he was not supposed to survive. His job was to walk calmly into Death's welcoming arms. Along the way, he was to dispose of Voldemort's remaining links to life, so that when at last he flung himself across Voldemort's path, and did not raise a wand to defend himself, the end would be clean, and the job that ought to have been done in Godric's Hollow would be finished: Neither would live, neither could survive.</div>

<div class="line_en">He felt his heart pounding fiercely in his chest. How strange that in his dread of death, it pumped all the harder, valiantly keeping him alive. But it would have to stop, and soon. Its beats were numbered. How many would there be time for, as he rose and walked through the castle for the last time, out into the grounds and into the forest?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他感觉到心脏在胸腔里剧烈地跳动。多么奇怪啊，他怀着对死亡的恐惧，然而他的心脏却跳得格外有力，勇敢地维持着他的生命。可是它不得不停止，而且很快就得停止。它跳动的次数不会太多了。当他站起身，最后一次穿越城堡，走过操场，进入禁林，这期间心脏还能跳多少次呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Terror washed over him as he lay on the floor, with that funeral drum pounding inside him. Would it hurt to die? All those times he had thought that it was about to happen and escaped, he had never really thought of the thing itself: His will to live had always been so much stronger than his fear of death. Yet it did not occur to him now to try to escape, to outrun Voldemort. It was over, he knew it, and all that was left was the thing itself: dying.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他躺在地板上，恐惧潮水般袭来，葬礼的鼓声在他内心咚咚敲响。死会疼吗？多少次他以为死到临头而又侥幸逃脱，却从未真正考虑过死亡本身。他对活的愿望总是比对死的恐惧要强烈得多。但现在他没有想到要逃跑，要摆脱伏地魔的魔爪。他知道，一切都结束了，剩下来的只有一件事了：死。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Slowly, very slowly, he sat up, and as he did so he felt more alive and more aware of his own living body than ever before. Why had he never appreciated what a miracle he was, brain and nerve and bounding heart? It would all be gone… or at least, he would be gone from it. His breath came slow and deep, and his mouth and throat were completely dry, but so were his eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="慢慢地，很慢很慢的，他坐了起来，这时他比以前任何时候都更真切地感觉到自己活着，更清楚地意识到自己有生命的躯体。他以前怎么从未认识到自己是个多么了不起的奇迹：头脑，神经，还有跳动的心脏？一切都将离开……至少，他将离这一切而去。他的呼吸缓慢、深重，嘴和喉咙都十分干燥，但眼睛也是干的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dumbledore's betrayal was almost nothing. Of course there had been a bigger plan; Harry had simply been too foolish to see it, he realized that now. He had never questioned his own assumption that Dumbledore wanted him alive. Now he saw that his life span had always been determined by how long it took to eliminate all the Horcruxes. Dumbledore had passed the job of destroying them to him, and obediently he had continued to chip away at the bonds tying not only Voldemort, but himself, to life! How neat, how elegant, not to waste any more lives, but to give the dangerous task to the boy who had already been marked for slaughter, and whose death would not be a calamity, but another blow against Voldemort.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="邓布利多的欺骗实在不算什么。当然是有一个更大的计划，只是哈利太愚蠢，没有看到。他现在总算明白了。他一直想当然地从不怀疑邓布利多希望他活着。现在他知道了，他生命的长短始终是由消灭所有魂器需要多少时间而决定的。邓布利多把消灭魂器的任务交给了他，他也就顺从地继续削弱那根不仅连接着伏地魔的生命、也连接着他自己生命的纽带！多么简洁，多么干脆，别再浪费更多的生命，把这危险的任务交给一个注定该死的男孩，他的死不会是一种灾难，而是对伏地魔的又一次打击。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">If he could only have died on that summer's night when he had left number four, Privet Drive, for the last time, when the noble phoenix-feather wand had saved him! If he could only have died like Hedwig, so quickly he would not have known it had happened! Or if he could have launched himself in front of a wand to save someone he loved… He envied even his parents' deaths now. This cold-blooded walk to his own destruction would require a different kind of bravery. He felt his fingers trembling slightly and made an effort to control them, although no one could see him; the portraits on the walls were all empty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果他在最后一次离开女贞路4号的那个夏夜死去该有多好，但高贵的凤凰羽毛魔杖救了他！如果他能像海德薇那样死去该有多好，在不知不觉间突然毙命！或者，如果他能为了救自己心爱的人，奋不顾身地挡在魔杖前……此刻他甚至嫉妒父母的死了。这样冷静从容地走向自己的毁灭实在需要一种不同的勇气。他感到自己的手指在微微颤抖，但他努力控制着，虽然并没有人能看见，墙上的肖像都是空的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And Dumbledore had known that Harry would not duck out, that he would keep going to the end, even though it was his end, because he had taken trouble to get to know him, hadn't he? Dumbledore knew, as Voldemort knew, that Harry would not let anyone else die for him now that he had discovered it was in his power to stop it. The images of Fred, Lupin, and Tonks lying dead in the Great Hall forced their way back into his mind's eye, and for a moment he could hardly breathe: Death was impatient…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="邓布利多知道哈利不会逃避，知道他会一直走到最后，尽管那是他的终结，因为邓布利多曾经努力了解哈利。不是吗？伏地魔知道，邓布利多也知道，哈利一旦发现自己有力量阻止，就不会听任别人为他去死。弗雷德、卢平和唐克斯的遗体躺在礼堂里的情景，又挤进哈利的脑海，令他一时简直透不过气来：死神迫不及待了……">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But Dumbledore had overestimated him. He had failed: The snake survived. One Horcrux remained to bind Voldemort to the earth, even after Harry had been killed. True, that would mean an easier job for somebody. He wondered who would do it… Ron and Hermione would know what needed to be done, of course… That would have been why Dumbledore wanted him to confide in two others… so that if he fulfilled his true destiny a little early, they could carry on…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是邓布利多把他估计得过高了。他失败了，那条蛇还活着。即使哈利被杀死了，仍有一个魂器把伏地魔绑在尘世间。当然啦，那意味着别人会比较容易得手。谁会做这件事呢，他猜想着……罗恩和赫敏肯定知道需要做什么……因此邓布利多才希望他把秘密透露给他们俩……这样，如果他提早一点实现了他真正的宿命，他们可以继续下去……">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The castle was empty. He felt ghostly striding through it alone, as if he had already died. The portrait people were still missing from their frames; the whole place was eerily still, as if all its remaining lifeblood were concentrated in the Great Hall where the dead and the mourners were crammed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="城堡里空荡荡的。他独自大步行走着，感觉像个幽灵，仿佛自己已经死了。那些画框里的肖像仍然空着，整个学校是一片诡异的死寂，似乎所有剩下来的生命都集中在了大礼堂，死者和哀悼者都挤在那里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry pulled the Invisibility Cloak over himself and descended through the floors, at last walking down the marble staircase into the entrance hall. Perhaps some tiny part of him hoped to be sensed, to be seen, to be stopped, but the Cloak was, as ever, impenetrable, perfect, and he reached the front doors easily.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利把隐形衣披在身上，走下一层层楼，最后顺着大理石楼梯来到门厅。也许，他内心某个小小的角落里希望有人感觉到他，看见他，阻拦他，但是隐形衣一如既往地完美、纹丝不漏，他很轻松地走到了门口。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He stood up. His heart was leaping against his ribs like a frantic bird. Perhaps it knew it had little time left, perhaps it was determined to fulfill a lifetime's beats before the end. He did not look back as he closed the office door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利站了起来，心像一只疯狂的小鸟，猛烈地撞击着他的胸肋。也许它知道时间已经不多了，也许它决定在结束之前完成一生的跳动。哈利没有回头再看一眼，关上了办公室的门。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ron and Hermione seemed a long way away, in a far-off country; he felt as though he had parted from them long ago. There would be no good-byes and no explanations, he was determined of that. This was a journey they could not take together, and the attempts they would make to stop him would waste valuable time. He looked down at the battered gold watch he had received on his seventeenth birthday. Nearly half of the hour allotted by Voldemort for his surrender had elapsed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="罗恩和赫敏似乎在很远很远的地方，在某个遥远的国度。他觉得自己跟他们分开很久了。不要告别，也不要解释，他已经拿定了主意。这是一段他们不能结伴同行的旅途，他俩会想方设法阻止他，那只会浪费宝贵的时间。他低头看了看十七岁生日得到的那块变了形的金表。伏地魔规定他投降的时间已经过去了近半个小时。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then Neville nearly walked into him. He was one half of a pair that was carrying a body in from the grounds. Harry glanced down and felt another dull blow to his stomach: Colin Creevey, though underage, must have sneaked back just as Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had done. He was tiny in death.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然，纳威差点撞在他身上。纳威和另一个人一起从操场上搬进一具尸体。哈利低头一看，心头又像是挨了一击：科林·克里维。他还不够年龄，肯定是像马尔福、克拉布和高尔那样偷偷溜回来的。死去的他显得那么幼小。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry took one glance back at the entrance of the Great Hall. People were moving around, trying to comfort each other, drinking, kneeling beside the dead, but he could not see any of the people he loved, no hint of Hermione, Ron, Ginny, or any of the other Weasleys, no Luna. He felt he would have given all the time remaining to him for just one last look at them; but then, would he ever have the strength to stop looking? It was better like this.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利最后看了一眼礼堂的入口。人们走来走去，互相安慰，喝东西，跪在死者身边，但他看不见一个他所爱的人，没有赫敏、罗恩、金妮和韦斯莱家的其他人，也没有卢娜。他觉得愿意用剩下来的所有时间换取看他们最后一眼，可是，如果那样的话，他是不是还有毅力把目光移开呢？还是这样更好。">查看中文翻译</div>

Harry saw Fenrir, skulking, chewing his long nails; the great blond Rowle was dabbing at his bleeding lip.
