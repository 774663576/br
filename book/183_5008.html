<div class="line_en">Lucy tried hard to console him and even screwed up her courage to kiss the scaly face, and nearly everyone said "Hard luck" and several assured Eustace that they would all stand by him and many said there was sure to be some way of disenchanting him and they'd have him as right as rain in a day or two. And of course they were all very anxious to hear his story, but he couldn't speak. More than once in the days that followed he attempted to write it for them on the sand. But, this never succeeded. In the first place Eustace (never having read the right books) had no idea how to tell a story straight. And for another thing, the muscles and nerves of the dragon-claws that he had to use had never learned to write and were not built for writing anyway. As a result he never got nearly to the end before the tide came in and washed away all the writing except the bits he had already trodden on or accidentaly swished out with his tail. And all that anyone had seen would be something like this -- the dots are for the bits he had smudged</div>

<div class="line_en">It was, however, clear to everyone that Eustace's character had been rather improved by becoming a dragon. He was anxious to help. He flew over the whole island and found it was all mountainous and inhabited only by wild goats and droves of wild swine. Of these he brought back many carcasses as provisions for the ship. He was a very humane killer too, for he could dispatch a beast with one blow of his tail so that it didn't know (and presumably still doesn't know) it had been killed. He ate a few himself, of course, but always alone, for now that he was a dragon he liked his food raw but he could never bear to let others see him at his messy meals. And one day, flying slowly and wearily but in great triumph, he bore back to camp a great tall pine tree which he had torn up by the roots in a distant valley and which could be made into a capital mast. And in the evening if it turned chilly, as it sometimes did after the heavy rains, he was a comfort to everyone, for the whole party would come and sit with their backs against his hot sides and get well warmed and dried; and one puff of his fiery breath would light the most obstinate fire. Sometimes he would take a select party for a fly on his back, so that they could see wheeling below them the green slopes, the rocky heights, the narrow pit-like valleys and far out over the sea to the eastward a spot of darker blue on the blue horizon which might be land.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是大家都明白，尤斯塔斯变成龙以后性格倒有相当长进了。他巴不得出点力。他飞遍全岛，发现岛上全是高山，只有野山羊和成群野猪。他就带回好多死羊死猪给船上补充给养。他也是一个非常讲人道的猎手，因为他只消尾巴一甩就可以把野物弄死，野物不知不觉（大概还不知道）就送了命。他自己当然也吃掉一点，但总是独自吃，因为他既然是条龙了，就喜欢吃生的，可他绝对受不了人家看见他吃着血糊糊的东西。有一天，他虽然飞得又慢又吃力，但是得意扬扬，原来他把一棵高大的松树带回了营地，这是他在远处一个山谷里连根拔起来的，可以用来做一根主桅。到了晚上，如果天气变冷，大雨过后时常这样，他就成了大家的火炉，因为全体人员都跑来，背靠着他热呼呼的两侧，焐得身子暖暖的，烘得身子干干的；他一喷出火似的气来，就能把最难着的柴火点燃。有时他还挑上几个人，骑在他背上飞行，让他们能看见在身子底下旋转而过的绿山坡，岩石嶙峋的高地，狭窄如坑的山谷，朝东的海面远处，天际有一个深蓝色的斑点，可能那就是陆地了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The pleasure (quite new to him) of being liked and, still more, of liking other people, was what kept Eustace from despair. For it was very dreary being a dragon. He shuddered whenever he caught sight of his own reflection as he flew over a mountain lake. He hated the huge batlike wings, the saw-edged ridge on his back, and the cruel, curved claws. He was almost afraid to be alone with himself and yet he was ashamed to be with the others. On the evenings when he was not being used as a hot-water bottle he would slink away from the camp and lie curled up like a snake between the wood and the water. On such occasions, greatly to his surprise, Reepicheep was his most constant comforter. The noble Mouse would creep away from the merry circle at the camp fire and sit down by the dragon's head, well to the windward to be out of the way of his smoky breath. There he would explain that what had happened to Eustace was a striking illustration of the turn of Fortune's wheel, and that if he had Eustace at his own house in Narnia (it was really a hole not a house and the dragon's head, let alone his body, would not have fitted in) he could show him more than a hundred examples of emperors, kings, dukes, knights, poets, lovers, astronomers, philosophers, and magicians, who had fallen from prosperity into the most distressing circumstances, and of whom many had recovered and lived happily ever afterwards. It did not, perhaps, seem so very comforting at the time, but it was kindly meant and Eustace never forgot it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尤斯塔斯觉得受人喜欢，更可贵的是觉得喜欢人家，这分乐趣对他是破天荒的，有了这分乐趣才让他不感到绝望。因为变成龙是非常乏味的。每逢他飞过一个山湖，看见自己的倒影，总不免打个寒噤。他痛恨那对巨大的蝙蝠翼，锯齿形的背脊，凶相的弯爪。他几乎害怕独自待着，但他又不好意思同别人在一起。晚上碰到没人把他当成热水袋时，他就偷偷从营地溜走，像条蛇似的蜷起身子，躺在林子和大海中间。碰到这种情况，大大出于他意料的，倒是雷佩契普经常来安慰他。高尚的老鼠会从围着篝火的欢乐人堆里偷偷跑掉，靠着龙头边坐下，看准风向，避开他冒烟的鼻息。于是它就解释说，尤斯塔斯的遭遇是造化弄人的一个明显事例，假如尤斯塔斯在纳尼亚它自己家做客（其实是个洞，不是屋子，龙头也容不下，别提身子了），它倒可以举出百来个例子说明，什么皇帝啊，国王啊，公爵啊，骑士啊，诗人啊，情人啊，天文学家啊，哲学家啊，还有魔法师啊，他们原先都富贵荣华，一下子跌到极其悲惨的境地，后来他们不少人都恢复过来，从此日子过得美美的。也许当时这话听来还不大令人宽慰，不过也是一片好意，尤斯塔斯对此终身难忘。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">About six days after they had landed on Dragon Island, Edmund happened to wake up very early one morning. It was just getting grey so that you could see the tree-trunks if they were between you and the bay but not in the other direction. As he woke he thought he heard something moving, so he raised himself on one elbow and looked about him: and presently he thought he saw a dark figure moving on the seaward side of the wood. The idea that at once occurred to his mind was, "Are we so sure there are no natives on this island after all?" Then he thought it was Caspian -- it was about the right size -- but he knew that Caspian had been sleeping next to him and could see that he hadn't moved. Edmund made sure that his sword was in its place and then rose to investigate.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们在龙岛上岸后，大约过了六天，有天爱德蒙恰巧大清早就醒了。天色刚灰蒙蒙，所以看得见身边和海滩之间的树干，不过别的方向看不见。他醒来时觉得听到什么动静，所以撑起一个肘拐儿，朝四下看看：不一会儿就觉得看见一个黑影在林子靠海那头走动。他脑子里顿时生出一个念头，“我们还那么肯定这岛上根本没有土人？”继而一想，这人是凯斯宾吧——个子差不多——可他知道凯斯宾一直睡在他身边，看得出他没动弹过。爱德蒙弄明白他的剑还在原处，就跳起身去查看了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But of course what hung over everyone like a cloud was the problem of what to do with their dragon when they were ready to sail. They tried not to talk of it when he was there, but he couldn't help overhearing things like, "Would he fit all along one side of the deck? And we'd have to shift all the stores to the other side down below so as to balance," or, "Would towing him be any good?" or "Would he be able to keep up by flying?" and (most often of all), "But how are we to feed him?" And poor Eustace realized more and more that since the first day he came on board he had been an unmitigated nuisance and that he was now a greater nuisance still. And this ate into his mind, just as that bracelet ate into his foreleg. He knew that it only made it worse to tear at it with his great teeth, but he couldn't help tearing now and then, especially on hot nights.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，像朵乌云般笼罩在大家头上的倒是那个难题：他们准备启航之际，拿这条龙怎么办。他在场的时候，大家都尽量避而不谈，可是他还是不免偷听到一些话，诸如“把他安顿在整个甲板的一边合适吗？那我们就得把全部贮藏搬到下面另一侧才能让船身平衡”。还有，“拖着他走好不好？”还有，“他能一直飞下去吗？”还有，最常听到的是“可是我们拿什么给他吃啊？”可怜的尤斯塔斯心里越来越清楚，自从他踏上甲板的头一天以来，就成了一个十足的讨厌包袱，如今他变成更大的包袱了。这想法深深腐蚀他的心，正如那手镯深深腐蚀他的前腿一样。他知道靠大牙咬手镯反而更糟，可是他忍不住还是时时去咬，尤其是在炎热的夜晚。">查看中文翻译</div>

I wasn't afraid of it eating me, I was just afraid of it -- if you can understand. Well, it came close up to me and looked straight into my eyes. And I shut my eyes tight.

And then I scratched a little deeper and, instead of just scales coming off here and there, my whole skin started peeling off beautifully, like it does after an illness, or as if I was a banana. In a minute or two I just stepped out of it. I could see it lying there beside me, looking rather nasty. It was a most lovely feeling. So I started to go down into the well for my bathe.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, exactly the same thing happened again. And I thought to myself, oh dear, how ever many skins have I got to take off? For I was longing to bathe my leg. So I scratched away for the third time and got off a third skin, just like the two others, and stepped out of it. But as soon as I looked at myself in the water I knew it had been no good.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没想到又是一模一样的事发生了。我暗自寻思，哎呀，我到底得蜕下多少层皮啊？因为我一心只想洗洗腿，所以我又抓了第三回，蜕下第三层皮，跟前两回一样，我就脱壳而出。谁知我朝水里一看自己的倒影，就知道又不妙了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Then the lion said -- but I don't know if it spoke -- "You will have to let me undress you." I was afraid of his claws, I can tell you, but I was pretty nearly desperate now. So I just lay flat down on my back to let him do it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“于是狮子说——可我不知道他是否真开口说了——一定得让我替你剥衣服。我可以实话告诉你，我怕他的爪子，可这回我实在是走投无路了。所以我就此仰天平躺，让他来干。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But just as I was going to put my feet into the water I looked down and saw that they were all hard and rough and wrinkled and scaly just as they had been before. Oh, that's all right, said I, it only means I had another smaller suit on underneath the first one, and I'll have to get out of it too. So 1 scratched and tore again and this underskin peeled off beautifully and out I stepped and left it lying beside the other one and went down to the well for my bathe.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“谁知正当我要把脚伸进水里，往下一看，又看见自己全身像刚才那样又粗又硬又皱，长满了鳞甲。哎呀，对了，我说，这无非说明我在第一层外衣下面还有一身小些的内衣，我也得脱去才行。所以我重新又抓又扯，里面这身皮也完整地剥下来了，我脱壳而出，让这身皮落在刚才那身皮旁边，就走到井边去洗澡了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, he peeled the beastly stuff right off -- just as I thought I'd done it myself the other three times, only they hadn't hurt -- and there it was lying on the grass: only ever so much thicker, and darker, and more knobbly-looking than the others had been. And there was I as smooth and soft as a peeled switch and smaller than I had been. Then he caught hold of me -- I didn't like that much for I was very tender underneath now that I'd no skin on -- and threw me into the water. It smarted like anything but only for a moment. After that it became perfectly delicious and as soon as I started swimming and splashing I found that all the pain had gone from my arm. And then I saw why. I'd turned into a boy again. You'd think me simply phoney if I told you how I felt about my own arms. I know they've no muscle and are pretty mouldy compared with Caspian's, but I was so glad to see them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好了，他把那层该死的皮当场扯掉了——正如我原以为前三回自己已经亲手扯掉过一样，只是前几回不痛——这层皮就落在草地上，只是要厚得多，黑得多，而且看上去比前几层皮更多疙瘩。这一来我就像一根剥掉皮的细树枝一样光滑柔软，个子比过去也小了些。于是他抓住我——我不大喜欢他这样做，因为我身上没有皮了，肉还很嫩——他把我扔到水里。真痛死了，幸亏只有一会儿工夫。过后就舒服极了，等我开始游泳拍水，手臂已经一点也不痛了。于是我才明白这是怎么回事。我又变回一个孩子了。我告诉你，我摸摸自己手臂的那分心情，你准会当我骗人。我知道手臂上没有肌肉，比起凯斯宾的手臂差劲多了，可是看见自己的手臂，心里别提有多高兴了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The very first tear he made was so deep that I thought it had gone right into my heart. And when he began pulling the skin off, it hurt worse than anything I've ever felt. The only thing that made me able to bear it was just the pleasure of feeling the stuff peel off. You know -- if you've ever picked the scab off a sore place. It hurts like billy-oh but it is such fun to see it coming away."</div>

The last bright star had vanished and though they could not see the sunrise because of the mountains on their right, they knew it was going on because the sky above them and the bay before them turned the colour of roses. Then some bird of the parrot kind screamed in the wood behind them, they heard movements among the trees, and finally a blast on Caspian's horn. The camp was astir.</div>

People wondered whether the other dragon had killed the Lord Octesian several years ago or whether Octesian himself had been the old dragon. The jewels with which Eustace had crammed his pockets in the cave had disappeared along with the clothes he had then been wearing: but no one, least of all Eustace himself, felt any desire to go back to that valley for more treasure.</div>

"Very well, then, catch as catch can," said Caspian and flung it up in the air. This was when they were all standing looking at the inscription. Up went the ring, flashing in the sunlight, and caught, and hung, as neatly as a well-thrown quoit, on a little projection on the rock. No one could climb up to get it from below and no one could climb down to get it from above. And there, for all I know, it is hanging still and may hang till that world ends.</div>
