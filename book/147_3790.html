<div class="line_en">Gant had piously contributed his vote for purity. Eugene remembered the day, years before, when he went proudly with his father to the polls. The militant "drys" had agreed to advertise their vote by wearing a scrap of white silk in their lapels. That was for purity. The defiant wets wore "red."</div>

<div class="line_en">Announced by violent trumpetings in the Protestant churches, the day of atonement dawned on a seasoned army of well drilled teetotalers. Those wets who had victoriously withstood the pressure of hearth and pulpit -- their number (aië, aië,) was small -- went to their death with the gallant swagger, and with the gleam of purloined honor, of men who are to die fighting most desperately against the engulfing mob.</div>

<div class="line_en">During the first years of this illness Gant showed a diminished, but not a seriously impaired, energy. At first he had, under the doctor's treatment, periods of tranquillity when he almost believed himself well. There were also times when he became a whining dotard over night, lay indolently abed for days, and was flabbily acquiescent to his disorder. These climaxes usually came on the heels of a roaring spree. The saloons had been closed for years: the town had been one of the first to vote on "local option."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="甘特生病的头几年中，他虽然精力大不如从前，但是身体并没有完全受损。在医生的治疗下，他起先过了一段平静、舒服的日子，本人甚至自以为没事了。有时候他一夜之间就变成不断哀鸣的老头，一连好几天慵懒地躺在床上，全身酸软无力，就像瘫痪了一样。这些表现往往会在他狂饮之后出现。但是这几年小城的酒吧早就关闭了，因为他们这个小城是全国最早投票行使“地方选择权”决定禁酒的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They did not know how gallant was their cause: they knew only that they had stood against the will of a priest-ridden community -- the most annihilating force in the village. They had never been told they stood for liberty; they stood rubily, stubbornly, with the strong brown smell of shame in their nostrils, for the bloodshot, malt-mouthed, red-nosed, loose-pursed Demon Rum. So, they came down with vine leaves in their hair, and a good fog of rye upon their breaths, and with brave set smiles around their determined mouths.</div>

<div class="line_en">As they approached the polls, glancing, like surrounded knights, for an embattled brother, the church women of the town, bent like huntresses above the straining leash, gave the word to the eager children of the Sunday schools.

<div class="line_en">A slow trickle of lust crawled painfully down the parched gulley of desire, and ended feebly in dry fumbling lechery. He made pretty young summer widows at Dixieland presents of money, underwear, and silk stockings, which he drew on over their shapely legs in the dusty gloom of his little office. Smiling with imperturbable tenderness, Mrs. Selborne thrust out her heavy legs slowly to swell with warm ripe smack his gift of flowered green-silk garters. Wetting his thumb with sly thin aftersmile, he told.</div>

For several years he ordered, from time to time, the alloted quota -- a gallon of whisky every two weeks -- from Baltimore. It was the day of the blind tiger. The town was mined thickly with them. Bad rye and moonshine corn were the prevailing beverages. He grew old, he was sick, he still drank.</div>

He transferred to her his storming abuse, muttered ominously to himself in long aisle-pacings at his shop, when he saw that he had lost the ancient freedom of his house and saddled himself with a tyrannous hag. One evening he returned insanely drunk, routed her out of her chamber and pursued her unfrocked, untoothed, unputtied, with a fluttering length of kimono in her palsied hand, driving her finally into the yard beneath the big cherry tree, which he circled, howling, making frantic lunges for her as she twittered with fear, casting splintered glances all over the listening neighborhood as she put on the crumpled wrapper, hid partially the indecent jigging of her breasts, and implored succor.

The playhouse was another of the strange extravagancies of Gantian fancy: it had been built for the children when they were young. It had been for many years closed, it was a retreat of delight; its imprisoned air, stale and cool, was scented permanently with old pine boards, cased books, and dusty magazines.</div>

Frowning gravely, he leaned upon the counter with feet crossed, reading, in a somewhat illiterate monotone, what they had written. His thin hairy wrists slatted leanly against his starched white cuffs, his strong nervous fingers, ivoried by nicotine, smoothed out the crumples. Scowling intently, he bent his fine head, erasing, arranging. Emphatic lady-fingers twitched. "How's that?" Answers vague-voiced, eyes tangled in crisp hair. "Oh, much better, thank you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="女性总喜欢用手抚摩他的卷发。她们到报社来登广告的时候总喜欢找他帮忙。他眉头紧锁，神情冷峻，双脚交叉靠在柜台边，像不识字的人一样单调地一字一字读着她们写的广告稿。他苍白、毛茸茸的手腕在浆洗得发白的袖口里晃动着，他用粗壮、被香烟熏得发黄的手指抚平了纸上的皱褶。他皱起眉头，专心致志地修改、润色词句。女主顾满腔热情，会猛地一把拿过稿子。“你看这样改怎么样？”回答往往含混不清，但是眼睛却盯着他的卷发。“噢，好多了，谢谢你了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sometimes, returning late at night to Woodson Street, in the crowded summer season, he slept with Eugene in the front room upstairs where they had all been born. Propped high on pillows in the old cream-colored bed, painted gaily at head and foot with round medals of clustering fruit, he read aloud in a quiet puzzled voice, fumbling over pronunciation, the baseball stories of Ring Lardner. "You know me, Al." Just outside the windows the flat veranda roof was still warm from its daytime exhalations of tar-calked tin. Rich cob-webbed grapes hung in packed clusters among the broad leaves. "I didn't raise my boy to be a southpaw. I've a good mind to give Gleason a sock in the eye."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="夏天的时候游客比较多，有时候，他会深更半夜返回伍德森街的房子和尤金睡在楼上前面的屋里。几个孩子全都出生在这间屋子里。他垫了几个枕头高卧在那张奶油色的床上，床头床尾漆着一团团水果图案。他高声念着铃·拉德纳的故事，声音迟疑、费力地摸索着发音。“阿尔，你是了解我的。”在窗外凉台上，平坦的铁皮屋顶被太阳晒了一天，现在仍然热乎乎的。一串串熟透的葡萄像蜘蛛网一样挂在叶子的下面。“我的孩子从小长大不是要做左撇子的。我真想揍扁格里逊的鼻子。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ben read painfully, pausing a moment later to snicker. Thus, like a child, he groped intently at all meanings, with scowling studiousness. Women liked to see him scowl and study so. He was sudden only in anger, and in his quick communications with his angel.</div>
