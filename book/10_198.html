<div class="line_en">Long days after they had climbed out of the valley and left the Last Homely House miles behind, they were still going up and up and up. It was a hard path and a dangerous path, a crooked way and a lonely and a long. Now they could look back over the lands they had left, laid out behind them far below. Far, far away in the West, where things were blue and faint, Bilbo knew there lay his own country of safe and comfortable things, and his little hobbit-hole. He shivered. It was getting bitter cold up here, and the wind came shrill among the rocks. Boulders, too, at times came galloping down the mountain-sides, let loose by mid-day sun upon the snow, and passed among them (which was lucky), or over their heads (which was alarming). The nights were comfortless and chill, and they did not dare to sing or talk too loud, for the echoes were uncanny, and the silence seemed to dislike being broken-except by the noise of water and the wail of wind and the crack of stone.</div>

<div class="line_en">There were many paths that led up into those mountains, and many passes over them. But most of the paths were cheats and deceptions and led nowhere or to bad ends; and most of the passes were infested by evil things and dreadful dangers. The dwarves and the hobbit, helped by the wise advice of Elrond and the knowledge and memory of Gandalf, took the right road to the right pass.</div>

<div class="line_en">"The summer is getting on down below," thought Bilbo, "and haymaking is going on and picnics. They will be harvesting and blackberrying, before we even begin to go down the other side at this rate." And the others were thinking equally gloomy thoughts, although when they had said good-bye to Elrond in the high hope of a midsummer morning, they had spoken gaily of the passage of the mountains, and of riding swift across the lands beyond. They had thought of coming to the secret door in the Lonely Mountain, perhaps that very next last moon of Autumn --"and perhaps it will be Durin's Day" they had said. Only Gandalf had shaken his head and said nothing. Dwarves had not passed that way for many years, but Gandalf had, and he knew how evil and danger had grown and thriven in the Wild, since the dragons had driven men from the lands, and the goblins had spread in secret after the battle of the Mines of Moria. Even the good plans of wise wizards like Gandalf and of good friends like Elrond go astray sometimes when you are off on dangerous adventures over the Edge of the Wild; and Gandalf was a wise enough wizard to know it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“山下面一定还是夏天呢。”比尔博想，“大家一定在忙着晒稻草，出去野餐什么的。照这个速度看来，还没等我们开始从山那边下去，他们都已经在收庄稼、摘黑莓了。”其他人的想法也和比尔博同样阴郁，尽管他们在夏至当天，曾满怀期望地和埃尔隆德道别，当时他们以愉快的心情谈论着怎样穿过山脉，然后在山那边的大地上放马驰骋。他们已经想到了怎样来到孤山密门之前，或许那时刚好就是下一次同样的秋月之夜。“或许还刚好是都林之日呢。”他们说。只有甘道夫摇了摇脑袋，什么也没说。矮人们已经有很多年没有走过这条道路了，但甘道夫走过，他知道在这片荒野之中，自从恶龙将人类从这片土地上赶走，半兽人又在墨瑞亚矿坑之战后秘密扩张，自那时起，这里有多少邪恶与危险在滋生着。只要你是前往荒野边缘去进行危险的冒险，那么即便是甘道夫这样睿智的巫师和埃尔隆德这样的好朋友制订的周全计划，照样会有可能出问题。甘道夫作为一个睿智的巫师，自然很清楚这一点。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Bilbo had never seen or imagined anything of the kind. They were high up in a narrow place, with a dreadful fall into a dim valley at one side of them. There they were sheltering under a hanging rock for the night, and he lay beneath a blanket and shook from head to toe. When he peeped out in the lightning-flashes, he saw that across the valley the stone-giants were out, and were hurling rocks at one another for a game, and catching them, and tossing them down into the darkness where they smashed among the trees far below, or splintered into little bits with a bang. Then came a wind and a rain, and the wind whipped the rain and the hail about in every direction, so that an overhanging rock was no protection at all. Soon they were getting drenched and their ponies were standing with their heads down and their tails between their legs, and some of them were whinnying with fright. They could hear the giants guffawing and shouting all over the mountainsides.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="比尔博这辈子从来没有看到过或者想到过还会有这样的景象。他们被困在一片狭窄的高处，一边是陡直的峭壁，下面是黑暗的山谷。他们躲在—块凸伸出来的岩石下面过夜，比尔博盖了条毯子，从头到脚一直都在抖个不停。当他借着闪电朝外看去时，发现山谷对面的岩石巨人跑了出来，相互用大石头扔来扔去当游戏在玩，还抓起石头往山下的黑暗里扔，那些石头要么把下面的树木砸得东倒西歪，要么嘭的一声碎成许多小块。这时来了一团风雨，风把雨水和冰雹朝四面八方抽打着，如此一来，凸出的岩石就连一点防护作用都起不到了。只一会儿工夫他们就被淋成了落汤鸡，小马们也垂头聋脑地站在那里，尾巴紧紧夹在后腿之间，有几匹还害怕得哀嚎了起来。他们听见山坡上到处是巨人们的狂笑声和尖叫声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He knew that something unexpected might happen, and he hardly dared to hope that they would pass without fearful adventure over those great tall mountains with lonely peaks and valleys where no king ruled. They did not. All was well, until one day they met a thunderstorm-more than a thunderstorm, a thunder-battle. You know how terrific a really big thunderstorm can be down in the land and in a river-valley; especially at times when two great thunderstorms meet and clash. More terrible still are thunder and lightning in the mountains at night, when storms come up from East and West and make war. The lightning splinters on the peaks, and rocks shiver, and great crashes split the air and go rolling and tumbling into every cave and hollow; and the darkness is filled with overwhelming noise and sudden light.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他知道总会有意料之外的事情发生，那些顶峰与谷地都显得那么孤单的巍巍高山，是没有国王来统治的地方，要越过那样的高山，他几乎不敢奢望一路上会连一点可怕的冒险都不碰上。他们的确碰上了。刚开始一切都还顺利，直到有一天，他们遇到了一场大雷雨——事实上，不仅仅是一场大雷雨，简直就是一场雷暴。你也知道在平原上或是河谷中，一场真正的大雷雨会有多么可怕，尤其是两场大雷雨冲撞到了一块儿的时候。比这还要可怕的雷与电在山区的夜里共同肆虐，再加上从东方和西方赶来，构成一场混战。闪电劈在山巅，岩石也为之战栗，声声巨响划破空气，隆隆地滚进所有的岩穴与山洞，黑暗中充斥着压倒一切的噪音和突如其来的刺眼光芒。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Soon Fili and Kili came crawling back, holding on to the rocks in the wind. "We have found a dry cave," they said, "not far round the next corner; and ponies and all could get inside."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="很快，菲力和奇力就在风中紧紧抓着岩石，几乎是爬着回来了。“我们找到了一个干的洞穴，”他们汇报道，“就在转个弯过去不远的地方，小马和所有的东西也都能挤得进去。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"This won't do at all!" said Thorin. "If we don't get blown off, or drowned, or struck by lightning, we shall be picked up by some giant and kicked sky-high for a football."</div>

<div class="line_en">The end of their argument was that they sent Fili and Kili to look for a better shelter. They had very sharp eyes, and being the youngest of the dwarves by some fifty years they usually got these sort of jobs (when everybody could see that it was absolutely no use sending Bilbo). There is nothing like looking, if you want to find something (or so Thorin said to the young dwarves). You certainly usually find something, if you look, but it is not always quite the something you were after. So it proved on this occasion.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吵到最后的结果是派菲力和奇力出去寻找更好的躲避处。他们俩都拥有非常锐利的眼睛，加之他们比其他矮人小了五十岁左右，是矮人中最年轻的两个，所以像这样的活儿通常都派给他们（大家都看得出来，要是派比尔博去绝对是白搭）。如果你是想要找某样东西（索林就是这么跟这两个年轻的矮人说的），学会怎么用眼睛看是最重要的。像平常那样随便看看当然也能找到东西，但其实找到的并不总是你真正要找的东西。这次的情形便证明了果然如此。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, if you know of anywhere better, take us there!" said Gandalf, who was feeling very grumpy, and was far from happy about the giants himself.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Have you thoroughly explored it?" said the wizard, who knew that caves up in the mountains were seldom unoccupied.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你们有没有彻底地检查过那个洞？”巫师很清楚在大山里很少会有没被占据的山洞，所以会有这样一问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes, yes!" they said, though everybody knew they could not have been long about it; they had come back too quick. "It isn't all that big, and it does not go far back."</div>

<div class="line_en">That, of course, is the dangerous part about caves: you don't know how far they go back, sometimes, or where a passage behind may lead to, or what is waiting for you inside. But now Fili and Kili's news seemed good enough. So they all got up and prepared to move. The wind was howling and the thunder still growling, and they had a business getting themselves and their ponies along. Still it was not very far to go, and before long they came to a big rock standing out into the path. If you stepped behind, you found a low arch in the side of the mountain. There was just room to get the ponies through with a squeeze, when they had been unpacked and unsaddled. As they passed under the arch, it was good to hear the wind and the rain outside instead of all about them, and to feel safe from the giants and their rocks. But the wizard was taking no risks. He lit up his wand-as he did that day in Bilbo's dining-room that seemed so long ago, if you remember --, and by its light they explored the cave from end to end.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这说的当然就是洞穴的最危险之处：有时候你不知道它们有多深，或是背后的某条通路又会连向何处，里面又有什么样的东西在等着你。但现在菲力和奇力带回来的消息似乎已经不错了。于是大家全都站起身来，准备动身。狂风依旧在凄号，闪电依然在咆哮，牵着小马赶路不是件容易事。可即便如此，路还是感觉近了点，没走多久，就来到了有一大块岩石突出在山道上的地方。如果绕到大石后面，就可以看到山壁上有个不高的拱门，大小刚够小马卸下行李和马鞍后挤进去的。走进拱门之后，风雨声被隔在了外面，这要比四面八方都能听到要感觉好多了，而且感觉巨人和他们扔的石头也威胁不到他们了。不过，巫师不想冒任何风险。他点亮了魔杖（如果你们还记得，不久前，他在比尔博家的饭厅里也这样做过，虽然那给人的感觉已经是很久以前了），借着魔杖的光芒把洞穴从头到尾检查了一遍。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It turned out a good thing that night that they had brought little Bilbo with them, after all. For, somehow, he could not go to sleep for a long while; and when he did sleep, he had very nasty dreams. He dreamed that a crack in the wall at the back of the cave got bigger and bigger, and opened wider and wider, and he was very afraid but could not call out or do anything but lie and look. Then he dreamed that the floor of the cave was giving way, and he was slipping-beginning to fall down, down, goodness knows where to.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从那天晚上发生的事情看来，他们把小比尔博带来实在是一件好事。因为他不知怎的一直睡不着，而等睡着时他又做起了很可怕的噩梦。他梦见山洞后方的一个裂缝变得越来越大、越来越宽，他心中恐惧万分，却什么也喊不出来，也无法动弹，只能躺在那里看。然后他又梦见地板慢慢不见了，他滑了起来，然后开始跌落、跌落，跌向不知何处。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It seemed quite a fair size, but not too large and mysterious. It had a dry floor and some comfortable nooks. At one end there was room for the ponies; and there they stood (mighty glad of the change) steaming, and champing in their nosebags. Oin and Gloin wanted to light a fire at the door to dry their clothes, but Gandalf would not hear of it. So they spread out their wet things on the floor, and got dry ones out of their bundles; then they made their blankets comfortable, got out their pipes and blew smoke rings, which Gandalf turned into different colours and set dancing up by the roof to amuse them. They talked and talked, and forgot about the storm, and discussed what each would do with his share of the treasure (when they got it, which at the moment did not seem so impossible); and so they dropped off to sleep one by one. And that was the last time that they used the ponies, packages, baggages, tools and paraphernalia that they had brought with them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山洞的空间不算小，但也没有大到让人觉得神秘莫测，地面干燥，几个角落看上去挺舒服的。在洞穴的一端有可以容纳小马的空间，它们就乖朮地站在那里散着身上的水汽（心里很高兴有这样的变化），一边嚼着嘴巴前挂着的牧草袋。欧因和格罗因想在洞口生一堆火来烤干衣服，但甘道夫根本不同意，因此他们只好把湿了的衣物在地上摊开，从行李里面拿出干衣服来换上。然后，他们舒舒服服地盖上毯子，拿出烟斗，开始喷起烟圈来。甘道夫把他们喷出来的烟圈变成各种颜色，驱策着它们朝洞顶一路舞去，算是给大家逗个乐子。他们聊啊聊的，忘记了外面的风雨，只顾兴奋地讨论要用自己那份宝藏来干些什么（当然得先拿到手，不过在此时看来，可能性似乎相当的大）。说着说着，大家就一个接一个地睡着了。而这就是他们最后一次用到他们带来的小马、行李、背包、工具和各种装备。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At that he woke up with a horrible start, and found that part of his dream was true. A crack had opened at the back of the cave, and was already a wide passage. He was just in time to see the last of the ponies' tails disappearing into it. Of course he gave a very loud yell, as loud a yell as a hobbit can give, which is surprising for their size.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="梦到这里，他害怕得惊醒了过来，发现刚才的梦境居然部分成真了。山洞后方已经裂开了一条口子，宽得已经成了一条通道。他正好及时看见最后一匹小马的尾巴消失在其间。他当然发出了一声响亮的叫喊，是一个霍比特人所能喊出最响的声音，以他们的身材来说，这已经很让人吃惊了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The crack closed with a snap, and Bilbo and the dwarves were on the wrong side of it! Where was Gandalf? Of that neither they nor the goblins had any idea, and the goblins did not wait to find out. They seized Bilbo and the dwarves and hurried them along. It was deep, deep, dark, such as only goblins that have taken to living in the heart of the mountains can see through. The passages there were crossed and tangled in all directions, but the goblins knew their way, as well as you do to the nearest post-office; and the way went down and down, and it was most horribly stuffy. The goblins were very rough, and pinched unmercifully, and chuckled and laughed in their horrible stony voices; and Bilbo was more unhappy even than when the troll had picked him up by his toes. He wished again and again for his nice bright hobbit-hole. Not for the last time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="裂缝啪嗒一声关上了，可是比尔博和矮人却被关在了另一边！甘道夫在哪儿？无论是他们还是半兽人都对此一无所知，而半兽人也不想留在那边寻找答案。他们抓着比尔博和矮人们，赶着他们快步前行。山洞十分的幽深黑暗，只有在大山肚子里住惯了的半兽人才能看得清。山洞里的路径曲里拐弯，错综复杂，但半兽人知道该怎么走，就像你们知道怎么到离家最近的邮局去一样。隧道不停地往下延伸，空气已经闷热得让人受不了了。半兽人们非常粗鲁，毫不留情地掐他们，还用他们如石头摩擦一般刺耳的声音发出咯咯嘎嘎的怪笑。比尔博这次比上回被食人妖抓住脚趾头倒拎着的时候还要难过，他一遍又一遍地在心里祈祷能回到自己可爱而又明亮的霍比特洞府里。当然，这也依然不会是最后一次。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Out jumped the goblins, big goblins, great ugly-looking goblins, lots of goblins, before you could say rocks and blocks. There were six to each dwarf, at least, and two even for Bilbo; and they were all grabbed and carried through the crack, before you could say tinder and flint. But not Gandalf. Bilbo's yell had done that much good. It had wakened him up wide in a splintered second, and when goblins came to grab him, there was a terrific flash like lightning in the cave, a smell like gunpowder, and several of them fell dead.</div>

They all laughed and stamped and clapped their hands, when the dwarves (with poor little Bilbo at the back and nearest to the whips) came running in, while the goblin-drivers whooped and cracked their whips behind. The ponies were already there huddled in a corner; and there were all the baggages and packages lying broken open, and being rummaged by goblins, and smelt by goblins, and fingered by goblins, and quarrelled over by goblins.</div>

<div class="line_en">There in the shadows on a large flat stone sat a tremendous goblin with a huge head, and armed goblins were standing round him carrying the axes and the bent swords that they use. Now goblins are cruel, wicked, and bad-hearted. They make no beautiful things, but they make many clever ones. They can tunnel and mine as well as any but the most skilled dwarves, when they take the trouble, though they are usually untidy and dirty. Hammers, axes, swords, daggers, pickaxes, tongs, and also instruments of torture, they make very well, or get other people to make to their design, prisoners and slaves that have to work till they die for want of air and light. It is not unlikely that they invented some of the machines that have since troubled the world, especially the ingenious devices for killing large numbers of people at once, for wheels and engines and explosions always delighted them, and also not working with their own hands more than they could help; but in those days and those wild parts they had not advanced (as it is called) so far. They did not hate dwarves especially, no more than they hated everybody and everything, and particularly the orderly and prosperous; in some parts wicked dwarves had even made alliances with them. But they had a special grudge against Thorin's people, because of the war which you have heard mentioned, but which does not come into this tale; and anyway goblins don't care who they catch, as long as it is done smart and secret, and the prisoners are not able to defend themselves.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在一块扁平巨石上的阴影之中，坐着一个身形巨大的半兽人，他长着一颗硕大的脑袋，身边簇拥着全副武装的半兽人，手中拿着他们擅长使用的斧子和弯刀。半兽人残忍、邪恶而又歹毒，他们虽然创造不出什么美丽的东西，却也能制作出一些精巧的东西来。尽管他们通常邋遢而又肮脏，但如果他们不怕麻烦的话，他们在挖隧道和开矿方面可以跟矮人做得一样棒，最多只输给矮人中最心灵手巧的那几个。锤子、斧子、刀剑、匕首、镐头、钳子还有各种刑具，他们都能够制作得非常出色，或者让别人照着他们的设计制作出来。这里所说的别人指的就是他们的俘虏和奴隶，这些人必须不停地工作，直到最后因为呼吸不到新鲜空气和见不到光明而死在地底。他们完全有可能发明过一些后来祸害过世界的机械，尤其是那些可以一下子杀死许多人的精巧装置，因为他们最喜欢轮子、动力装置和爆炸，而且用这样的装置杀人可以最大程度免去他们亲自动手之苦。但在当时那个时代，在那样的荒僻之地，他们还没有进步（姑且称其为进步吧）到如此的程度。他们并不特别痛恨矮人，对矮人的仇视并不比对所有人和所有事物的仇视更多，他们尤其不讨厌那些听话的和有钱的矮人，在某些地区，他们甚至会和矮人中的败类结盟。但他们对索林那一族却怀着特别的恶意，这是因为之前提到过的那场战争之故，但在我们这个故事里，我们无暇细述这段往事。不过再怎么说，半兽人对他们要抓的对象是不太在意的，他们在乎的是要把活儿干得漂亮，神不知鬼不觉的，要让那些被抓的人还来不及抵抗就乖乖就擒。">查看中文翻译</div>

It made no trouble whatever of cutting through the goblin-chains and setting all the prisoners free as quickly as possible. This sword's name was Glamdring the Foe-hammer, if you remember. The goblins just called it Beater, and hated it worse than Biter if possible. Orcrist, too, had been saved; for Gandalf had brought it along as well, snatching it from one of the terrified guards.
