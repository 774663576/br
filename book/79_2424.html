<div class="line_en">Darkness and hallways. He was wandering through darkness and hallways that were like those which lay within the body of the hotel but were somehow different. The silkpapered walls stretched up and up, and even when he craned his neck, Danny could not see the ceiling. It was lost in dimness. All the doors were locked, and they also rose up to dimness. Below the peepholes (in these giant doors they were the size of gunsights), tiny skulls and crossbones had been bolted to each door instead of room numbers.</div>

<div class="line_en">"No!" He cried it out in a distant grief, a terror that seemed damped by these dreamy, dreary surroundings. Nonetheless, death images came to him: dead frog plastered to the turnpike like a grisly stamp; Daddy's broken watch lying on top of a box of junk to be thrown out; gravestones with a dead person under every one; dead jay by the telephone pole; the cold junk Mommy scraped off the plates and down the dark maw of the garbage disposal.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不！”他喊出声来，叫声里隐含着悲伤，隐含着恐怖，但是，这恐怖仿佛被梦幻般的沉闷环境弱化了。然而，一帧帧死亡的图像接踵而来：死青蛙像一张可怕的印花贴在公路上；爸爸的破表躺在装满垃圾的盒子上：墓碑，每一块下面都压着一个死人；电线杆旁边的死鸟；妈妈从盘子里赶进垃圾袋黑洞洞的肚子里的剩饭菜。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Yet he could not equate these simple symbols with the shifting complex reality of his mother; she satisfied his childish definition of eternity. She had been when he was not. She would continue to be when he was not again. He could accept the possibility of his own death, he had dealt with that since the encounter in Room 217.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，他还不能把这些简单的符号等同于妈妈复杂多变的现实状况；在丹尼十分稚气的定义中，妈妈就是永恒。在他出世之前她就活着，他死去之后她仍将活着。他能够接受自己的死亡，在217房间遭遇那一幕之后他就考虑过这种可能性了。">查看中文翻译</div>

His terror, cool and distant a moment ago, became a more immediate thing. Now the words could be made out.

<div class="line_en">"Oh Tony, is it my daddy?" Danny screamed. "Is it my daddy that's coming to get me?" Tony didn't answer. But Danny didn't need an answer. He knew. A long and nightmarish masquerade party went on here, and had gone on for years. Little by little a force had accrued, as secret and silent as interest in a bank account.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“噢，托尼，它是我爸爸吗？”丹尼尖声叫道。“是爸爸要来揍我吗？”托尼没有回答，但丹尼并不需要答案，他知道。一场漫长的、梦魇般的假面舞会在这里举行，已经持续了许多年。一点一点地，某种力量积聚起来了，秘密的，静悄悄的，像存折里的利息一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Force, presence, shape, they were all only words and none of them mattered. It wore many masks, but it was all one. Now, somewhere, it was coming for him. It was hiding behind Daddy's face, it was imitating Daddy's voice, it was wearing Daddy's clothes.</div>

<div class="line_en">And now Tony stood directly in front of him, and looking at Tony was like looking into a magic mirror and seeing himself in ten years, the eyes widely spaced and very dark, the chin firm, the mouth handsomely molded. The hair was light blond like his mother's, and yet the stamp on his features was that of his father, as if Tony -- as if the Daniel Anthony Torrance that would someday be -- was a halfling caught between father and son, a ghost of both, a fusion.</div>

<div class="line_en">And as he went, the walls that had been so high and remote began to come down; the rug which had only been a blur beneath his feet took on the familiar black and blue pattern, sinuously woven together; the doors became numbered again and behind them the parties that were all one went on and on, populated by generations of guests. The air seemed to be shimmering around him, the blows of the mallet against the walls echoing and re-echoing. He seemed to be bursting through some thin placental womb from sleep to the rug outside the Presidential Suite on the third floor; lying near him in a bloody heap were the bodies of two men dressed in suits and narrow ties. They had been taken out by shotgun blasts and now they began to stir in front of him and get up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他往前走着，刚才还那么高渺的墙壁矮下来了；刚才模模糊糊的地毯也显现出了那种熟悉的蓝黑图案；门上又有了房间号，门背后过去与现在合而为一的聚会在不间断地进行下去，里面聚满了各个时期的客人。空气仿佛在他周围闪着光辉，木槌击在墙上的声音经过多次反射不断地回响着。他好像在睡梦中冲破了一个薄薄的子宫掉在了四楼总统套间外面的地毯上；离他不远的地方躺着一堆血淋淋的东西。那是两个男人的尸体，他们穿着西服，打着窄式领带。他们被猎枪子弹的冲击力掼了出来，现在，在丹尼面前，他们开始蠕动，终于站起来了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Somewhere in the maze of corridors behind him, the elevator came to a stop.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他背后的迷宫般的走廊里的什么地方，电梯停了下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Danny!" it roared. "Come here, you pup! Come here and take it like a man!" A loud, hollow boom as the mallet struck the wall. When the voice roared out his name again it had changed location. It had come closer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“丹尼！”它吼道。“出来，小狗崽子！出来，要做个男子汉！”木槌砸在墙上，发出了空洞的嘭嘭巨响。那个声音再次吼他名字时已经移动了地点，它更近了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was a metallic, rattling crash as the gate was thrown back. And then a voice -- not in his head now but terribly real -- called out: "Danny? Danny, come here a minute, will you? You've done something wrong and I want you to come and take your medicine like a man. Danny? Danny!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="电梯门哐当一声开了。接着，一个声音——这次不在他脑子里，而是真实得可怕——喊道：“丹尼？丹尼，出来，就一会儿，好吗？你做了错事，出来，别当胆小鬼。丹尼？丹尼！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Danny ran. Feet silent on the heavy carpet, he ran past the closed doors, past the silk figured wallpaper, past the fire extinguisher bolted to the corner of the wall. He hesitated, and then plunged down the final corridor. Nothing at the end but a bolted door, and nowhere left to run.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="丹尼跑起来，在厚厚的地毯上没踩出什么声音。他一路经过那些紧闭的门，经过了固定在墙拐角的那具灭火器，丝质墙纸不断向后退去。他稍稍犹豫了一下，然后冲上了最后那条过道。过道尽头只有一扇闩牢的门，已经无处可逃了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Obedience was so strongly ingrained in him that he actually took two automatic steps toward the sound of that voice before stopping. His hands curled into fists at his sides.</div>

<div class="line_en">Danny snatched it up. He craned his neck to stare up at the trapdoor. There was a hook on the end of the pole and you had to catch it on a ring set into the trapdoor. You had to -- There was a brand-new Yale padlock dangling from the trapdoor. The lock Jack Torrance had clipped around the hasp after laying his traps, just in case his son should take the notion into his head to go exploring up there someday.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="丹尼抓着杆子，仰着脖子往上望了望活动天窗。杆头有只钩子，必须把它挂进天窗上的那个环里，必须——一只崭新的挂锁吊在天窗上。锁是杰克·托兰斯放好捕鼠夹后挂在天窗搭扣上的，正是为了提防他儿子哪一天动了上去探探险的念头的。">查看中文翻译</div>
