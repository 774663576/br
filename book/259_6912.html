<div class="line_en">As I turned the rental car onto Morrie's street in West Newton, a quiet suburb of Boston, I had a cup of coffee in one hand and a cellular phone between my ear and shoulder. I was talking to a TV producer about a piece we were doing. My eyes jumped from the digital clock-my return flight was in a few hours-to the mailbox numbers on the tree-lined suburban street. The car radio was on, the all-news station. This was how I operated, five things at once.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Okay," he said. "It's gonna take a second."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好的，”他说，“稍等片刻。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Roll back the tape," I said to the producer. "Let me hear that part again."</div>

<div class="line_en">At the sight of my old professor, I froze.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="看见我的老教授，我惊呆了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Suddenly, I was upon the house. I pushed the brakes, spilling coffee in my lap. As the car stopped, I caught a glimpse of a large Japanese maple tree and three figures sitting near it in the driveway, a young man and a middleaged woman flanking a small old man in a wheelchair. Morrie.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然，那幢房子跃入了我的眼帘。我踩下刹车，咖啡晃出了杯子。车停下后，我瞥见了车道上的那棵日本大槭树和它旁边坐着的三个人。坐在两边的是一个年轻人和一个中年妇女，中间是一个坐在轮椅上的老人。莫里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Hello?" the producer said in my ear. "Did I lose you?… "</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“喂？”制片人的声音在我耳边响了起来。“你还在听吗？……”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I had not seen him in sixteen years. His hair was thinner, nearly white, and his face was gaunt. I suddenly felt unprepared for this reunion-for one thing, I was stuck on the phone-and I hoped that he hadn't noticed my arrival, so that I could drive around the block a few more times, finish my business, get mentally ready. But Morrie, this new, withered version of a man I had once known so well, was smiling at the car, hands folded in his lap, waiting for me to emerge.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我有十六年没有见到他。他的头发更稀了，几近花白，形容枯槁。我突然感到我还没有准备好重逢——至少，我眼下还得先应付完这个电话——我希望他并没有注意到我的到来，这样，我就可以再驶过几个街区，办完我的公事，做好心理准备。但莫里，这位我曾经是那么熟悉但现在又是那么陌生、那么憔悴的老人，此时正对着车子在微笑。他两手交叉着放在腿上，等待着我从车子里出现。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Hey?" the producer said again. "Are you there?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“喂，”制片人又在喊。“你在听吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For all the time we'd spent together, for all the kindness and patience Morrie had shown me when I was young, I should have dropped the phone and jumped from the car, run and held him and kissed him hello. Instead, I killed the engine and sunk down off the seat, as if I were looking for something.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="为了我们多年的相处，为了莫里曾经给予我的那份体贴和耐心，我应该丢掉电话，跳出车子去拥抱他，去吻他。但我没那么做。我关掉了引擎，蹲伏下身子似乎在找东西。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yeah, yeah, I'm here," I whispered, and continued my conversation with the TV producer until we were finished.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，我在听，”我压低嗓门继续同制片人在交谈，直到把事情谈妥。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I did what I had become best at doing: I tended to my work, even while my dying professor waited on his front lawn. I am not proud of this, but that is what I did.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我做了我最擅长的事情。我仍在关心我的工作，尽管来日无多的老教授在他门前草坪等着我。我并不引以为自豪，但这正是我所做的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now, five minutes later, Morrie was hugging me, his thinning hair rubbing against my cheek. I had told him I was searching for my keys, that's what had taken me so long in the car, and I squeezed him tighter, as if I could crush my little lie. Although the spring sunshine was warm, he wore a windbreaker and his legs were covered by a blanket. He smelled faintly sour, the way people on medication sometimes do. With his face pressed close to mine, I could hear his labored breathing in my ear.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="五分钟后，莫里拥抱了我，他稀松的头发擦过我的脸颊。我告诉他刚才我在找钥匙，所以在车里呆了那么久。我更用力地抱住他，似乎想挤碎我的小谎言。虽然春天的阳光暖融融的，他却穿着一件风衣，腿上还盖着毯子。他嘴里发出一股淡淡的酸味，那是正在服药的人常有的一种气味。由于他的脸凑得离我很近，我能听见他吃力的呼吸声。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"My old friend," he whispered, "you've come back at last."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我的老朋友，”他轻声说，“你终于回来了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He rocked against me, not letting go, his hands reaching up for my elbows as I bent over him. I was surprised at such affection after all these years, but then, in the stone walls I had built between my present and my past, I had forgotten how close we once were. I remembered graduation day, the briefcase, his tears at my departure, and I swallowed because I knew, deep down, that I was no longer the good, gift-bearing student he remembered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他倚着我摇晃着身子，始终没和我分开。当我俯下身去时，他的手抓住了我的肘部。相隔了这么多年他居然能保持着这份感情，我感到十分惊讶。但再一想。正由于我在我的过去和现在之间建立起了一堵石墙，所以我会忘记我们曾有过的亲密，我记起了毕业的那天，记起了那只皮包和我离开时他的泪花。但我没有流露出来，因为我在内心深处已经意识到，我不再是那个他记忆中的赠送他礼物的好学生了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I only hoped that, for the next few hours, I could fool him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我所希望的是，我能在接下来的几个小时里蒙住他的眼睛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Inside the house, we sat at a walnut dining room table, near a window that looked out on the neighbor's house. Morrie fussed with his wheelchair, trying to get comfortable. As was his custom, he wanted to feed me, and I said all right. One of the helpers, a stout Italian woman named Connie, cut up bread and tomatoes and brought containers of chicken salad, hummus, and tabouli.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="进屋后，我们坐在一张胡桃木的餐桌旁，靠近一扇能望见邻居宅院的窗户。莫里在轮椅上不停地动，想使自己坐舒服些。他想请我吃点什么，这是他的习惯，我说好的。助手中有一位名叫康尼、长得很结实的意大利女人端上了切好的面包。土豆，以及放有鸡肉色拉。鹰嘴豆泥和小麦色拉的盘子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She also brought some pills. Morrie looked at them and sighed. His eyes were more sunken than I remembered them, and his cheekbones more pronounced. This gave him a harsher, older look-until he smiled, of course, and the sagging cheeks gathered up like curtains.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她还拿来了药片。莫里朝它们看看，叹了口气。他的眼睛凹陷得比我想象中的还要深，颧骨也突得更出了。这使他显得更苍老——只有他笑的时候，那松垂的脸颊才像帷幕一样收拢起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It is my freshman year. Morrie is older than most of the teachers, and I am younger than most of the students, having left high school a year early. To compensate for my youth on campus, I wear old gray sweatshirts and box in a local gym and walk around with an unlit cigarette in my mouth, even though I do not smoke. I drive a beat-up Mercury Cougar, with the windows down and the music up. I seek my identity in toughness-but it is Morrie's softness that draws me, and because he does not look at me as a kid trying to be something more than I am, I relax.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那是我大学的第一年。莫里的年龄比大部分教师大，而我却比大多数学生小，因为我提前一年就高中毕业了。为了在校园里不显得稚嫩，我身着旧的灰色无领长袖衫，常去当地的体育馆打拳，走路时还叼上一支没有点燃的烟，尽管我不会吸烟。我开的是一辆水星牌的破车，震耳的音乐声从没有摇上的车窗里传出来。我竭力表现出粗野的个性——然而，莫里的和蔼吸引了我，而且，也正因为他没有把我看成是一个未经世故的孩子，于是我释然了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Mitch," he said softly, "you know that I'm dying."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“米奇，”他轻声说，“你知道我离死期不远了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">What it's like? To die?</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes," he said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，”他说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"All right, then." Morrie swallowed the pills, put down the paper cup, inhaled deeply, then let it out. "Shall I tell you what it's like?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那好，”莫里吞下了药片，放下纸杯，深深地吸了口气，再慢慢地呼出来。“要我告诉你是怎么回事吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I finish that first course with him and enroll for another. He is an easy marker; he does not much care for grades. One year, they say, during the Vietnam War, Morrie gave all his male students A's to help them keep their student deferments.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我上完了他的第一门课，又选了他的另一门课程。他是个打分很宽松的教授，不太注重分数。据说有一年，那是在越战期间，莫里给所有的男学生都打了A，使他们能获得缓役的机会。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Although I was unaware of it, our last class had just begun.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他让我捧腹大笑。在我认识他的那段时间里，我最强烈的两个愿望是：拥抱他和给他一张餐巾纸。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I begin to call Morrie "Coach," the way I used to address my high school track coach. Morrie likes the nickname.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我开始称呼他“教练”，就像我称呼高中的田径教练那样。莫里很喜欢这个绰号。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sometimes we eat together in the cafeteria. Morrie, to my delight, is even more of a slob than I am. He talks instead of chewing, laughs with his mouth open, delivers a passionate thought through a mouthful of egg salad, the little yellow pieces spewing from his teeth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有时我们一起在餐厅用餐。令我高兴的是，他比我还要不修边幅。他吃东西时爱说话，还张大嘴笑，从他满嘴的鸡蛋色拉和沾着蛋黄的牙缝里传出富有激情的思想。">查看中文翻译</div>
