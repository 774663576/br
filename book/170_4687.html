<div class="line_en">Daenerys Targaryen had preferred to hold court from a bench of polished ebony, smooth and simple, covered with the cushions that Ser Barristan had found to make her more comfortable. King Hizdahr had replaced the bench with two imposing thrones of gilded wood, their tall backs carved into the shape of dragons. The king seated himself in the right-hand throne with a golden crown upon his head and a jeweled sceptre in one pale hand. The second throne remained vacant.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ser Barristan Selmy slipped a hand beneath the fold of his cloak and loosened his sword in its scabbard.

<div class="line_en">The day was young and fresh, and yet he felt bone-tired, as if he'd fought all night. The older he got, the less sleep Ser Barristan seemed to need. As a squire he could sleep ten hours a night and still be yawning when he stumbled out onto the practice yard. At three-and-sixty he found that five hours a night was more than enough. Last night, he had scarce slept at all. His bedchamber was a small cell off the queen's apartments, originally slave quarters; his furnishings consisted of a bed, a chamber pot, a wardrobe for his clothing, even a chair should he want to sit. On a bedside table he kept a beeswax candle and a small carving of the Warrior. Though he was not a pious man, the carving made him feel less alone here in this queer alien city, and it was to that he had turned in the black watches of night. Shield me from these doubts that gnaw at me, he had prayed, and give me the strength to do what is right. But neither prayer nor dawn had brought him certainty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽然时间还很早，但他却疲惫入骨，仿佛他奋战过一夜。岁数增长着，但睡眠却减少着。当侍从的岁月里，他一夜要睡十个钟头，却依然在步入操练场时哈欠连天。然而63岁得他却发觉，5个小时用于睡眠都绰绰有余。昨夜，他压根没有睡。他的寝室紧邻女王寝宫，本是奴隶营房。他的家具不过一张床、夜壶、衣柜，以及一把他从未坐过的椅子。在床头柜上，他放着蜡烛和战士的小雕像。虽然他不虔诚，但这雕像能让他在这异乡少点孤独，这也是他值夜岗的缘由。让我免于被滋生的怀疑所扰吧，他祈求道，赐予我力量去做正义之事。但无论是祈祷还是黎明都没有给予他信心。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">To the right of the twin thrones stood Goghor the Giant, a huge hulk of a man with a brutal, scarred face. To the left was the Spotted Cat, a leopard skin flung over one shoulder. Back of them were Belaquo Bone-breaker and the cold-eyed Khrazz. Seasoned killers all, thought Selmy, but it is one thing to face a foe in the pit when his coming is heralded by horns and drums and another to find a hidden killer before he can strike.</div>

<div class="line_en">The hall thrummed to the sound of a hundred low voices, echoing off the pillars and the marble floor. It made an ominous sound, angry. It reminded Selmy of the sound a hornets' nest might make an instant before hornets all came boiling out. And on the faces in the crowd he saw anger, grief, suspicion, fear.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大厅内齐声响起数百个低鸣，回响在大理石板和石柱之间。这使预兆之音变得愤恼。这让赛尔弥联想到成群的大黄蜂来到前的那一只警戒蜂的轰鸣，而他在聚集的人群脸上看见了愤怒、悲哀、怀疑、恐惧。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Skahaz could be in the hall as well, Selmy realized, that ugly face of his concealed behind a mask. Two score Brazen Beasts stood between the pillars, torchlight shining off the polished brass of their masks. The Shavepate could be any one of them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯卡哈兹应该也在厅内，赛尔弥意识到，他那臭脸隐藏在面具之后。四十个铜盔野兽站在柱子间，火炬之光在他们的面具上闪耀。那个剃头者可能是他们中的任意一个。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The hall was as crowded as the old knight had ever seen it, but it was the missing faces that Barristan Selmy noted most: Missandei, Belwas, Grey Worm, Aggo and Jhogo and Rakharo, Irri and Jhiqui, Daario Naharis. In the Shavepate's place stood a fat man in a muscled breastplate and lion's mask, his heavy legs poking out beneath a skirt of leather straps: Marghaz zo Loraq, the king's cousin, new commander of the Brazen Beasts. Selmy had already formed a healthy contempt for the man. He had known his sort in King's Landing -- fawning to his superiors, harsh to his inferiors, as blind as he was boastful and too proud by half.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大厅里从未这么拥挤过，但那些确实的面孔才是巴利斯坦·赛尔弥最怀念的：弥桑黛、贝沃斯、灰虫子、阿戈和乔戈以及卡拉洛，伊莉和姬琪，达里奥·纳哈里斯。站在剃头者位置的是个带着狮面塑形胸甲的胖子他沉重的腿几乎撑破了皮带；马哈兹·莫·坎达克，国王的表亲，铜盔野兽的新指挥官，打从赛尔弥看见他的第一眼就对他产生了轻蔑的印象。在君临他就如此，媚上欺下这套他做不到，不仅出于骄傲，更出于自豪。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Hardly had the king's new herald called the court to order than the ugliness began. One woman began to wail about a brother who had died at Daznak's Pit, another of the damage to her palanquin. A fat man tore off his bandages to show the court his burned arm, where the flesh was still raw and oozing. And when a man in a blue-and-gold tokar began to speak of Harghaz the Hero, a freedman behind him shoved him to the floor. It took six Brazen Beasts to pull them apart and drag them from the hall. Fox, hawk, seal, locust, lion, toad. Selmy wondered if the masks had meaning to the men who wore them. Did the same men wear the same masks every day, or did they choose new faces every morning?</div>

<div class="line_en">A tall Ghiscari in a brocade robe spoke next, in a voice as sonorous as it was cold. King Hizdahr shifted on his dragon throne, his face stony as he did his best to appear concerned but unperturbed. Once again his seneschal gave answer.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ser Barristan let Reznak's oily words wash over him. His years in the Kingsguard had taught him the trick of listening without hearing, especially useful when the speaker was intent on proving that words were truly wind. Back at the rear of the hall, he spied the Dornish princeling and his two companions. They should not have come. Martell does not realize his danger. Daenerys was his only friend at this court, and she is gone. He wondered how much they understood of what was being said.

<div class="line_en">Prince Quentyn was listening intently, at least. That one is his father's son. Short and stocky, plain-faced, he seemed a decent lad, sober, sensible, dutiful… but not the sort to make a young girl's heart beat faster. And Daenerys Targaryen, whatever else she might be, was still a young girl, as she herself would claim when it pleased her to play the innocent. Like all good queens she put her people first -- else she would never have wed Hizdahr zo Loraq -- but the girl in her still yearned for poetry, passion, and laughter. She wants fire, and Dorne sent her mud.</div>

<div class="line_en">Behind the prince, Ser Gerris Drinkwater was whispering something to Yronwood. Ser Gerris was all his prince was not: tall and lean and comely, with a swordsman's grace and a courtier's wit. Selmy did not doubt that many a Dornish maiden had run her fingers through that sun-streaked hair and kissed that teasing smile off his lips. If this one had been the prince, things might have gone elsewise, he could not help but think… but there was something a bit too pleasant about Drinkwater for his taste. False coin, the old knight thought. He had known such men before.</div>

I could not help Prince Lewyn on the Trident, but I can help his nephew now. Martell was dancing in a vipers' nest, and he did not even see the snakes.

Nor was Prince Lewyn his only uncle. He is kin to the Red Viper. Daenerys had taken another for her consort, but if Hizdahr died, she would be free to wed again. Could the Shavepate have been wrong? Who can say that the locusts were meant for Daenerys? It was the king's own box. What if he was meant to be the victim all along? Hizdahr's death would have smashed the fragile peace. The Sons of the Harpy would have resumed their murders, the Yunkishmen their war. Daenerys might have had no better choice than Quentyn and his marriage pact.</div>

Aerys would have flinched away in horror, likely cutting himself on the barbs of the Iron Throne, then shrieked at his swordsmen to cut the Yunkishmen to pieces. Robert would have shouted for his hammer to repay Bloodbeard in kind. Even Jaehaerys, reckoned weak by many, would have ordered the arrest of Bloodbeard and the Yunkish slavers.</div>
