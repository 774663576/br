Say something enough times and you never forget it. Also, I can tell you what happened after the book thief's words had stopped, and how I came to know her story in the first place. Like this.</div>

<div class="line_en">Picture yourself walking down Himmel Street in the dark. Your hair is getting wet and the air pressure is on the verge of drastic change. The first bomb hits Tommy Muller's apartment block. His face twitches innocently in his sleep and I kneel at his bed. Next, his sister. Kristina's feet are sticking out from under the blanket. They match the hopscotch footprints on the street. Her little toes. Their mother sleeps a few feet away. Four cigarettes sit disfigured in her ashtray, and the roofless ceiling is hot plate red. Himmel Street is burning.</div>

The boy slept. His candlelit hair ignited the bed, and I picked both him and Bettina up with their souls still in the blanket. If nothing else, they died fast and they were warm. The boy from the plane, I thought. The one with the teddy bear. Where was Rudy's comfort? Where was someone to alleviate this robbery of his life?

I carried him softly through the broken street, with one salty eye and a heavy, deathly heart. With him, I tried a little harder. I watched the contents of his soul for a moment and saw a black-painted boy calling the name Jesse Owens as he ran through an imaginary tape. I saw him hip-deep in some icy water, chasing a book, and I saw a boy lying in bed, imagining how a kiss would taste from his glorious next-door neighbor. He does something to me, that boy. Every time. It's his only detriment. He steps on my heart. He makes me cry.</div>

<div class="line_en">He was tall in the bed and I could see the silver through his eyelids. His soul sat up. It met me. Those kinds of souls always do -- the best ones. The ones who rise up and say, "I know who you are and I am ready. Not that I want to go, of course, but I will come." Those souls are always light because more of them have been put out. More of them have already found their way to other places. This one was sent out by the breath of an accordion, the odd taste of champagne in summer, and the art of promise-keeping. He lay in my arms and rested. There was an itchy lung for a last cigarette and an immense, magnetic pull toward the basement, for the girl who was his daughter and was writing a book down there that he hoped to read one day.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="躺在床上的他还是那样高大，我可以透过他的眼睑看到他银色的眼眸。他的灵魂坐起来，与我相见。总有些灵魂会这样，都是些最好的灵魂。他们会在起身后说道：“我知道你是谁，我已经做好了准备。当然，我并不想离开，但还是会跟你走。”这些灵魂总是很轻盈，因为他们中的大多数已经找到了归宿。这个灵魂已经被手风琴的呼吸，夏日里香槟独特的味道，还有信守承诺的艺术给带走了。他躺在我的怀里休息。他的肺还痒痒的，想要抽上最后一根香烟；此外还有一股巨大的磁力吸引着他，令他想再去地下室看看，看看那个被他当作女儿的姑娘，他还希望有一天能读到女儿写的那本书。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For me, there was only a Rosa, and yes, I truly think I picked her up midsnore, for her mouth was open and her papery pink lips were still in the act of moving. If she'd seen me, I'm sure she would have called me a Saukerl, though I would not have taken it badly. After reading The Book Thief, I discovered that she called everyone that. Saukerl. Saumensch. Especially the people she loved. Her elastic hair was out. It rubbed against the pillow and her wardrobe body had risen with the beating of her heart. Make no mistake, the woman had a heart. She had a bigger one than people would think. There was a lot in it, stored up, high in miles of hidden shelving. Remember that she was the woman with the instrument strapped to her body in the long, moon-slit night. She was a Jew feeder without a question in the world on a man's first night in Molching. And she was an arm reacher, deep into a mattress, to deliver a sketchbook to a teenage girl.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后，就只剩罗莎了，说真的，我捡起她的灵魂时，她恐怕刚好正在打鼾，因为她的嘴张得老大，两片粉色的薄嘴唇还在翕动。如果她看见我，我敢说她肯定会管我叫蠢猪，其实我不觉得这个称呼有多难听。读完《偷书贼》后，我发现她把所有人都叫作蠢猪或母猪，尤其是那些她深深爱着的人。她蓬松的头发铺展在枕头上。衣柜般庞大的身躯与心跳一同起伏。你可别搞错了，这个女人有一颗心，她的心比大多数人想的都要广阔，里面存放了许多东西，高高地搁在你看不见的架子上。你还记不记得那个被长长的月光分割的房间？她就是那个抱着乐器沉默不语的女人。当一位犹太人初来乍到，饥肠辘辘地出现在莫尔辛时，她毫不犹豫地喂饱了他。而且她还把涂鸦书藏在床垫下面，等候合适的时机交给一位十几岁的女孩。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In disbelief, Liesel buried her head into Rudy's chest. She held his limp body, trying to keep him from lolling back, until she needed to return him to the butchered ground. She did it gently.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莉泽尔不敢相信，她深深地把头埋在鲁迪的胸膛上。她抱起他无力的身躯，徒劳地不想让他倒下，却抱不住他，只能再把他放回这片饱受屠戮的大地上。她的动作十分轻柔。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She did not say goodbye. She was incapable, and after a few more minutes at his side, she was able to tear herself from the ground. It amazes me what humans can do, even when streams are flowing down their faces and they stagger on, coughing and searching, and finding.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她没有说再见。她说不出口。又在他身边待了几分钟后，她勉强让自己站起身来。人类的潜能总是让我吃惊，尽管他们脸上热泪滚滚，却依旧能跌跌撞撞地前行，一边咳嗽，一边寻找，直到找到他们寻觅的东西。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She leaned down and looked at his lifeless face and Liesel kissed her best friend, Rudy Steiner, soft and true on his lips. He tasted dusty and sweet. He tasted like regret in the shadows of trees and in the glow of the anarchist's suit collection. She kissed him long and soft, and when she pulled herself away, she touched his mouth with her fingers. Her hands were trembling, her lips were fleshy, and she leaned in once more, this time losing control and misjudging it. Their teeth collided on the demolished world of Himmel Street.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她俯下身，看着他毫无生气的脸庞。莉泽尔温柔而真诚地亲吻了挚友鲁迪·施泰纳的双唇，他的嘴唇有尘土的气息和甜味，尝起来像是树荫里的懊悔，像是捣乱分子的西装铺灯下的懊悔。她温柔地吻了他好久。抬起身时，她又用手指触碰他的嘴唇。她的双手在颤抖，她的双唇丰满而柔软。她再次俯下身，这一次她失去了控制。在化为废墟的希默尔街上，他们的牙齿相互碰撞。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="莉泽尔压根儿就没有奔跑，也没有走动。她的双眼在人堆里搜寻着，发现一个高个子和一个像衣柜般的矮个子女人时，她赶忙停了下来。那是我妈妈，那是我爸爸。可是这些话却像钉在她嘴里，怎么也说不出口。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Perhaps if she stood still long enough, it would be they who moved, but they remained motionless for as long as Liesel did. I realized at that moment that she was not wearing any shoes. What an odd thing to notice right then. Perhaps I was trying to avoid her face, for the book thief was truly an irretrievable mess.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="也许她在想，只要她一直站在原地不动，爸爸妈妈就真的会爬起来找她，可是无论莉泽尔在那里站了多久，他们都一动不动。这个时候，我突然发现她脚上没穿鞋子。我为什么会注意到这种奇怪的事情呢？也许是因为我在躲避她的脸，因为偷书贼已经心乱如麻、彻底崩溃。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She took a step and didn't want to take any more, but she did. Slowly, Liesel walked to her mama and papa and sat down between them. She held Mama's hand and began speaking to her. "Remember when I came here, Mama? I clung to the gate and cried. Do you remember what you said to everyone on the street that day?" Her voice wavered now. "You said, 'What are you assholes looking at?'" She took Mama's hand and touched her wrist. "Mama, I know that you… I liked when you came to school and told me Max had woken up. Did you know I saw you with Papa's accordion?" She tightened her grip on the hardening hand. "I came and watched and you were beautiful. Goddamn it, you were so beautiful, Mama."</div>

<div class="line_en">At that point, I couldn't help it. I walked around to see her better, and from the moment I witnessed her face again, I could tell that this was who she loved the most. Her expression stroked the man on his face. It followed one of the lines down his cheek. He had sat in the washroom with her and taught her how to roll a cigarette. He gave bread to a dead man on Munich Street and told the girl to keep reading in the bomb shelter. Perhaps if he didn't, she might not have ended up writing in the basement.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个时候，我再也无法克制自己。为了看得更清楚，我换了个位置。当我再次看到她的脸，我立刻明白了，这绝对是她最爱的人。她的目光抚摸着男人的脸，顺着他脸上的皱纹抚摸下去。他曾经和她一起坐在盥洗室里，教会她怎么卷香烟。他曾经把面包施舍给慕尼黑大街上一个行将就木的人，曾鼓励女孩在防空洞里继续为大家朗读。如果没有他，她也许不会在地下室里写她的故事。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And I can promise you something, because it was a thing I saw many years later -- a vision in the book thief herself -- that as she knelt next to Hans Hubermann, she watched him stand and play the accordion. He stood and strapped it on in the alps of broken houses and played the accordion with kindness silver eyes and even a cigarette slouched on his lips. He even made a mistake and laughed in lovely hindsight. The bellows breathed and the tall man played for Liesel Meminger one last time as the sky was slowly taken from the stove.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我可以向你发誓，许多年以后，我才透过偷书贼的想象看到了当时她脑海中的场景。她跪在汉斯·胡伯曼身旁，看着他演奏手风琴的模样。他站起来，在断壁残垣中将手风琴挂在了身上。他的眼眸闪着银光，唇间叼着一根香烟。他甚至弹错了一个音，自己发现后哈哈大笑。风箱在呼气和吸气，这个高大的男人最后一次为莉泽尔·梅明格演奏手风琴，这时，那一锅恶心的炖菜般的天空才被慢慢从炉火上移开。">查看中文翻译</div>
