<div class="line_en">Now, I am married to a woman blessed with far more intuitive kindness than I. Although she had never met Morrie, she took the phone –I would have shaken my head and whispered, "I'm not here! I'm not here!" -- and in a minute, she was connecting with my old professor as if they'd known each other since college.

<div class="line_en">We laughed, and Morrie laughed, too, as hard as he could, with his limited breathing. It was the first time in weeks that I could recall him telling a story like this. How strange, I thought, that he nearly fainted once from watching someone else's illness, and now he was so able to endure his own.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们笑了，莫里也笑了，但笑得很艰难，因为他的呼吸功能很有限。这是这几个星期来他第一次这么说笑。真不可思议，我想，看见别人的疾病曾差点晕倒的他居然能忍受自己如此凶险的顽疾。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Connie knocked on the door and said that Morrie's lunch was ready. It was not the carrot soup and vegetable cakes and Greek pasta I had brought that morning from Bread and Circus. Although I tried to buy the softest of foods now, they were still beyond Morrie's limited strength to chew and swallow. He was eating mostly liquid supplements, with perhaps a bran muffin tossed in until it was mushy and easily digested. Charlotte would puree almost everything in a blender now. He was taking food through a straw. I still shopped every week and walked in with bags to show him, but it was more for the look on his face than anything else. When I opened the refrigerator, I would see an overflow of containers. I guess I was hoping that one day we would go back to eating a real lunch together and I could watch the sloppy way in which he talked while chewing, the food spilling happily out of his mouth. This was a foolish hope.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="康尼来敲门说莫里的午餐准备好了。午餐不是我那天早上在面包马戏超市买来的胡萝卜汤。蔬菜饼和希腊面食。尽管我挑最容易咀嚼和消化的软食买，可莫里极有限的咀嚼和下咽功能仍对付不了它们。他现在主要吃流质，顶多来一块搅拌成泥状、容易消化的麦麸松饼。几乎所有的食物夏洛特都要做成羹，他用吸管进食。我每个星期仍然去采购，带着食品袋走进房间。但这么做无非是为了博得他的高兴而已，一打开冰箱，我便看见堆得满满的食品。我也许在期待有那么一天，我俩能在一起真正地吃上一顿午餐，我想见到他边嚼食物边说话的样子，嘴角油腻腻的。可这是个愚蠢的期待。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Marriage. Almost everyone I knew had a problem with it. Some had problems getting into it, some had problems getting out. My generation seemed t0 struggle with the commitment, as if it were an alligator from some murky swamp. I had gotten used to attending weddings, congratulating the couple, and feeling only mild surprise when I saw the groom a few years later sitting in a restaurant with a younger woman whom he introduced as a friend. "You know, I'm separated from so-and-so…" he would say.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, I feel sorry for your generation," Morrie said. "In this culture, it's so important to find a loving relationship with someone because so much of the culture does not give you that.

You realize that, especially when you're in a time like I am, when you're not doing so well.
