<div class="line_en">So long as Mistress Mary's mind was full of disagreeable thoughts about her dislikes and sour opinions of people and her determination not to be pleased by or interested in anything, she was a yellow-faced, sickly, bored and wretched child. Circumstances, however, were very kind to her, though she was not at all aware of it. They began to push her about for her own good. When her mind gradually filled itself with robins, and moorland cottages crowded with children, with queer crabbed old gardeners and common little Yorkshire housemaids, with springtime and with secret gardens coming alive day by day, and also with a moor boy and his "creatures," there was no room left for the disagreeable thoughts which affected her liver and her digestion and made her yellow and tired.</div>

<div class="line_en">In each century since the beginning of the world wonderful things have been discovered. In the last century more amazing things were found out than in any century before. In this new century hundreds of things still more astounding will be brought to light. At first people refuse to believe that a strange new thing can be done, then they begin to hope it can be done, then they see it can be done -- then it is done and all the world wonders why it was not done centuries ago. One of the new things people began to find out in the last century was that thoughts -- just mere thoughts -- are as powerful as electric batteries -- as good for one as sunlight is, or as bad for one as poison. To let a sad thought or a bad one get into your mind is as dangerous as letting a scarlet fever germ get into your body. If you let it stay there after it has got in you may never get over it as long as you live.</div>

<div class="line_en">So long as Colin shut himself up in his room and thought only of his fears and weakness and his detestation of people who looked at him and reflected hourly on humps and early death, he was a hysterical half-crazy little hypochondriac who knew nothing of the sunshine and the spring and also did not know that he could get well and could stand upon his feet if he tried to do it. When new beautiful thoughts began to push out the old hideous ones, life began to come back to him, his blood ran healthily through his veins and strength poured into him like a flood. His scientific experiment was quite practical and simple and there was nothing weird about it at all. Much more surprising things can happen to any one who, when a disagreeable or discouraged thought comes into his mind, just has the sense to remember in time and push it out by putting in an agreeable determinedly courageous one. Two things cannot be in one place.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="只要柯林把自己关在房间里，只想着他的恐惧、虚弱、和对看着他的人的憎恶，没个钟头都想起肿包和早夭，他就是个歇斯底里、半疯的小疑心病患者，不知道阳光和春天为何物，也不知道要是他努力去试，他可以好起来、自己站起来。当美丽的新念头开始推开丑陋的旧念头，生命开始重回他身上，他的血液健康地流过血管，力量如同洪水般涌入他。他的科学实验很是简单实用，没什么可奇怪的。更加惊人的新变化会发生在任何人身上，如果一个不顺心或者泄气的念头来到他心里，有理智及时记起来放进一个和谐、坚决、勇敢的念头，来推开它。两种念头不能同处一室。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">While the secret garden was coming alive and two children were coming alive with it, there was a man wandering about certain far-away beautiful places in the Norwegian fiords and the valleys and mountains of Switzerland and he was a man who for ten years had kept his mind filled with dark and heart-broken thinking. He had not been courageous; he had never tried to put any other thoughts in the place of the dark ones. He had wandered by blue lakes and thought them; he had lain on mountainsides with sheets of deep blue gentians blooming all about him and flower breaths filling all the air and he had thought them. A terrible sorrow had fallen upon him when he had been happy and he had let his soul fill itself with blackness and had refused obstinately to allow any rift of light to pierce through. He had forgotten and deserted his home and his duties. When he traveled about, darkness so brooded over him that the sight of him was a wrong done to other people because it was as if he poisoned the air about him with gloom. Most strangers thought he must be either half mad or a man with some hidden crime on his soul. He was a tall man with a drawn face and crooked shoulders and the name he always entered on hotel registers was, "Archibald Craven, Misselthwaite Manor, Yorkshire, England."</div>

<div class="line_en">He had traveled far and wide since the day he saw Mistress Mary in his study and told her she might have her "bit of earth." He had been in the most beautiful places in Europe, though he had remained nowhere more than a few days. He had chosen the quietest and remotest spots. He had been on the tops of mountains whose heads were in the clouds and had looked down on other mountains when the sun rose and touched them with such light as made it seem as if the world were just being born.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="自从他在书房见到玛丽小姐，告诉她可以拥有她的“一点泥土”，他旅行的地域广大而遥远。他曾到过欧洲最美丽的地方，然而他在任何地方都呆不了几天。他选择最宁静最偏远的地方。他曾在群山之顶，峰顶入云，他曾俯瞰群山，当太阳升起时为群山染上光辉，仿佛整个世界正在诞生。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But the light had never seemed to touch himself until one day when he realized that for the first time in ten years a strange thing had happened. He was in a wonderful valley in the Austrian Tyrol and he had been walking alone through such beauty as might have lifted any man's soul out of shadow. He had walked a long way and it had not lifted his. But at last he had felt tired and had thrown himself down to rest on a carpet of moss by a stream. It was a clear little stream which ran quite merrily along on its narrow way through the luscious damp greenness. Sometimes it made a sound rather like very low laughter as it bubbled over and round stones. He saw birds come and dip their heads to drink in it and then flick their wings and fly away. It seemed like a thing alive and yet its tiny voice made the stillness seem deeper. The valley was very, very still.</div>

<div class="line_en">As he sat gazing into the clear running of the water, Archibald Craven gradually felt his mind and body both grow quiet, as quiet as the valley itself He wondered if he were going to sleep, but he was not. He sat and gazed at the sunlit water and his eyes began to see things growing at its edge. There was one lovely mass of blue forget-me-nots growing so close to the stream that its leaves were wet and at these he found himself looking as he remembered he had looked at such things years ago. He was actually thinking tenderly how lovely it was and what wonders of blue its hundreds of little blossoms were. He did not know that just that simple thought was slowly filling his mind -- filling and filling it until other things were softly pushed aside. It was as if a sweet clear spring had begun to rise in a stagnant pool and had risen and risen until at last it swept the dark water away. But of course he did not think of this himself. He only knew that the valley seemed to grow quieter and quieter as he sat and stared at the bright delicate blueness. He did not know how long he sat there or what was happening to him, but at last he moved as if he were awakening and he got up slowly and stood on the moss carpet, drawing a long, deep, soft breath and wondering at himself. Something seemed to have been unbound and released in him, very quietly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当阿奇博尔得·克兰文凝视着清澈的流水，渐渐觉得身心俱静，静如山谷。他想着自己是不是要睡着了，然而他没有。他坐着凝视着阳光照彻的流水，眼睛开始看见东西的边缘在生长。一片好看的勿忘我④长得离溪流很近，叶子湿了，他惊奇地发现自己注视着这些花朵，他记起来多年前曾经也注视过这种东西。他竟然温柔地想这多么可爱，这千万点小小花朵的蓝色是怎样的奇景。他不知道就这么一个简单的想法在慢慢注入他的心——注入、注入，直到其他东西被轻柔地推到一旁。仿佛甜美清新的春天开始从一潭死水里升起，升起、升起，直到终于扫去了黑水。不过他自己当然没有想到这一点。他只知道，当他坐着盯着那鲜艳娇嫩的蓝色，山谷仿佛越来越静。他不知道在那儿坐了多久，自己发生了什么，但是他最后一动，仿佛醒来，他慢慢起来，站在苔藓地毯上，深深地、长长地、柔和地吸了一口气，觉得自己奇怪。仿佛有什么东西在他里面解开了，放松了，悄无声息地。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The singular calmness remained with him the rest of the evening and he slept a new reposeful sleep; but it was not with him very long. He did not know that it could be kept. By the next night he had opened the doors wide to his dark thoughts and they had come trooping and rushing back. He left the valley and went on his wandering way again. But, strange as it seemed to him there were minutes -- sometimes half-hours -- when, without his knowing why, the black burden seemed to lift itself again and he knew he was a living man and not a dead one. Slowly -- slowly -- for no reason that he knew of -- he was "coming alive" with the garden.</div>

Now and then he wondered vaguely about his boy and asked himself what he should feel when he went and stood by the carved four-posted bed again and looked down at the sharply chiseled ivory-white face while it slept and the black lashes rimmed so startlingly the close-shut eyes.

No one ever knew when he would go out or come in or where he would choose to sleep or if he would roam about the garden or lie in the boat on the lake all night. The man held a salver with some letters on it and he waited quietly until Mr. Craven took them. When he had gone away Mr. Craven sat a few moments holding them in his hand and looking at the lake. His strange calm was still upon him and something more -- a lightness as if the cruel thing which had been done had not happened as he thought -- as if something had changed. He was remembering the dream -- the real -- real dream.</div>

He had supplied doctors and nurses and luxuries, but he had shrunk from the mere thought of the boy and had buried himself in his own misery. The first time after a year's absence he returned to Misselthwaite and the small miserable looking thing languidly and indifferently lifted to his face the great gray eyes with black lashes round them, so like and yet so horribly unlike the happy eyes he had adored, he could not bear the sight of them and turned away pale as death.

He had refused to see it, and when he had gone to look at it at last it had been such a weak wretched thing that everyone had been sure it would die in a few days. But to the surprise of those who took care of it the days passed and it lived and then everyone believed it would be a deformed and crippled creature.</div>

If he had not been under the spell of the curious calmness which had taken possession of him he would have been more wretched than ever. But the calm had brought a sort of courage and hope with it.
