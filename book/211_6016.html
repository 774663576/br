<div class="line_en">The sun, on account of the mist, had a curious sentient, personal look, demanding the masculine pronoun for its adequate expression. His present aspect, coupled with the lack of all human forms in the scene, explained the old-time heliolatries in a moment. One could feel that a saner religion had never prevailed under the sky. The luminary was a golden-haired, beaming, mild-eyed, God-like creature, gazing down in the vigour and intentness of youth upon an earth that was brimming with interest for him.</div>

<div class="line_en">But of all ruddy things that morning the brightest were two broad arms of painted wood, which rose from the margin of a yellow cornfield hard by Marlott village. They, with two others below, formed the revolving Maltese cross of the reaping-machine, which had been brought to the field on the previous evening to be ready for operations this day. The paint with which they were smeared, intensified in hue by the sunlight, imparted to them a look of having been dipped in liquid fire.</div>

<div class="line_en">Presently there arose from within a ticking like the love-making of the grasshopper. The machine had begun, and a moving concatenation of three horses and the aforesaid long rickety machine was visible over the gate, a driver sitting upon one of the hauling horses, and an attendant on the seat of the implement. Along one side of the field the whole wain went, the arms of the mechanical reaper revolving slowly, till it passed down the hill quite out of sight. In a minute it came up on the other side of the field at the same equable pace; the glistening brass star in the forehead of the fore horse first catching the eye as it rose into view over the stubble, then the bright arms, and then the whole machine.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不久，麦地里传来一种“嚓嚓”声，好像是蚂蚱情说爱的声音。机器开始割麦了，从栅栏门这边看过去，只见三匹马并排拉着前面说过的摇摇晃晃的长方形机器向前走着，有一匹拉机器的马上骑着一个赶马的，机器的座位上坐着一个看机器的。机器战车沿着麦地的一边向前开动，机器割麦子的手臂慢慢转动着，一直开过了山坡，完全从眼前消失了。过了一会儿，它又以同样均匀的速度出现在麦地的另一边；割麦子的机器在麦茬地上出现时，最先看见的是前面那匹马额上闪闪发光的铜星，然后看见的是机器割麦子的鲜红色手臂，最后看见的才是整部机器。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The field had already been 'opened'; that is to say, a lane a few feet wide had been hand-cut through the wheat along the whole circumference of the field, for the first passage of the horses and machine.</div>

They disappeared from the lane between the two stone posts which flanked the nearest field-gate.</div>

<div class="line_en">The reaping-machine left the fallen corn behind it in little heaps, each heap being of the quantity for a sheaf; and upon these the active binders in the rear laid their hands -- mainly women, but some of them men in print shirts, and trousers supported round their waists by leather straps, rendering useless the two buttons behind, which twinkled and bristled with sunbeams at every movement of each wearer, as if they were a pair of eyes in the small of his back.</div>

<div class="line_en">The narrow lane of stubble encompassing the field grew wider with each circuit, and the standing corn was reduced to smaller area as the morning wore on. Rabbits, hares, snakes, rats, mice, retreated inwards as into a fastness, unaware of the ephemeral nature of their refuge, and of the doom that awaited them later in the day when, their covert shrinking to a more and more horrible narrowness, they were huddled together, friends and foes, till the last few yards of upright wheat fell also under the teeth of the unerring reaper, and they were every one put to death by the sticks and stones of the harvesters.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="割麦子的机器每走一圈，麦地周围狭长的麦茬长带就加宽一层，随着早晨的时光慢慢过去，还长有麦子的麦地就只剩下不大的一块了。大野兔、小野兔、长虫、大老鼠、小耗子，都一起向麦田的内地退去，好像要躲进堡垒里，却没有意识到它们避难的地方也只能是暂时的，没有意识到它们毁灭的命运正在后面等着它们，当今天它们躲避的地方越缩越小，最后变成可怕的一小块时，它们无论是朋友还是仇敌，都要拥挤着躲藏在一块儿了，等到收割机把地上最后剩下的几百码麦子割倒后，收庄稼的人就会拿起棍子和石头，把它们一个个打死。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The women -- or rather girls, for they were mostly young -- wore drawn cotton bonnets with great flapping curtains to keep off the sun, and gloves to prevent their hands being wounded by the stubble. There was one wearing a pale pink jacket, another in a cream-coloured tight-sleeved gown, another in a petticoat as red as the arms of the reaping-machine; and others, older, in the brown-rough 'wropper' or over-all-the old-established and most appropriate dress of the field-woman, which the young ones were abandoning. This morning the eye returns involuntarily to the girl in the pink cotton jacket, she being the most flexuous and finely-drawn figure of them all. But her bonnet is pulled so far over her brow that none of her face is disclosed while she binds, though her complexion may be guessed from a stray twine or two of dark brown hair which extends below the curtain of her bonnet. Perhaps one reason why she seduces casual attention is that she never courts it, though the other women often gaze around them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="妇女们——不如说是女孩子们，因为她们大多青春年少——都戴着打着皱折的女帽，帽子上宽大的帽檐可以遮挡太阳，她们的手上戴的手套可以保护双手不被麦茬划伤。在她们中间，有一个人穿着粉红色上衣，有一个人穿着奶油色的窄袖长衫，还有一个人穿着短裙，短裙的颜色红得就像收割机的十字架一样；其他的妇女们年纪都要大些，都穿着棕色的粗布罩衫或者外套——那是妇女在地里劳动穿的最合适的老式样的服装，年轻的女孩子们都已经不再穿它们了。这天早晨，大家的目光都被吸引到那个穿粉红色棉布上衣的姑娘身上，在所有的女孩子中间，她的身材最苗条和最富有弹性。但是她的帽子拉得低低的，盖住了她的额头，所以在她捆麦子的时候，一点儿也看不见她的脸，不过从她的帽檐下面散落出来的一两绺深褐色头发上，大致可以猜测出她的皮肤的颜色来，她不能躲避别人的偶尔注意，也许有一个原因就是她不想别人注意她，而其他的妇女们的眼睛总是流波四顾的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But those of the other sex were the most interesting of this company of binders, by reason of the charm which is acquired by woman when she becomes part and parcel of outdoor nature, and is not merely an object set down therein as at ordinary times. A field-man is a personality afield; a field-woman is a portion of the field; she has somehow lost her own margin, imbibed the essence of her surrounding, and assimilated herself with it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是在这一群捆麦子的人中间，还是那些女子们最能引起人的兴致，因为女人一旦在户外变成了大自然的一部分，不再和平时那样，仅仅只是摆放在那儿的一件物品，那时候她们就特别具有魅力。一个男人在地里只是地里的一个人；一个女人在地里却是田地的组成部分；她在某些方面同田地失去了界限，吸收了周围环境的精华，使自己同周围的环境融成了一体。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Her binding proceeds with clock-like monotony. From the sheaf last finished she draws a handful of ears, patting their tips with her left palm to bring them even. Then stooping low she moves forward, gathering the corn with both hands against her knees, and pushing her left gloved hand under the bundle to meet the right on the other side, holding the corn in an embrace like that of a lover. She brings the ends of the bond together, and kneels on the sheaf while she ties it, beating back her skirts now and then when lifted by the breeze. A bit of her naked arm is visible between the buff leather of the gauntlet and the sleeve of her gown; and as the day wears on its feminine smoothness becomes scarified by the stubble, and bleeds.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她不断地捆着麦子，单调得就像时钟一样。她从刚捆好的麦捆里抽出一把麦穗来，用左手掌拍着麦头儿，把它们弄整齐。然后，她向前把腰弯下去，一双手把麦堆拢到膝盖跟前，戴着手套的左手从麦堆下面伸过去，同另一边的右手会合了，就像拥抱一个情人一样把麦子抱在怀里。她把捆扎麦子的那束麦子的两头收拢来，跪在麦捆上把它捆紧，微风把她的裙子吹了起来，她也不断地把它扯回去。在她衣服的袖子和暗黄色软皮手套之间，看得见有一截裸露的胳膊露在外面；这一天慢慢过去了，女孩儿圆润的胳膊也被麦茬刺破了，流出了鲜血。">查看中文翻译</div>

Then one can see the oval face of a handsome young woman with deep dark eyes and long heavy clinging tresses, which seem to clasp in a beseeching way anything they fall against. The cheeks are paler, the teeth more regular, the red lips thinner than is usual in a country-bred girl.</div>

As the hour of eleven drew near a person watching her might have noticed that every now and then Tess's glance flitted wistfully to the brow of the hill, though she did not pause in her sheafing. On the verge of the hour the heads of a group of children, of ages ranging from six to fourteen, rose above the stubbly convexity of the hill.</div>

Another brought some lunch. The harvesters ceased working, took their provisions, and sat down against one of the shocks. Here they fell to, the men plying a stone jar freely, and passing round a cup.</div>

<div class="line_en">Tess Durbeyfield had been one of the last to suspend her labours. She sat down at the end of the shock, her face turned somewhat away from her companions. When she had deposited herself a man in a rabbit-skin cap and with a red handkerchief tucked into his belt, held the cup of ale over the top of the shock for her to drink. But she did not accept his offer. As soon as her lunch was spread she called up the big girl her sister, and took the baby of her, who, glad to be relieved of the burden, went away to the next shock and joined the other children playing there. Tess, with a curiously stealthy yet courageous movement, and with a still rising colour, unfastened her frock and began suckling the child.</div>

After wearing and wasting her palpitating heart with every engine of regret that lonely inexperience could devise, common-sense had illumined her. She felt that she would do well to be useful again -- to taste anew sweet independence at any price. The past was past; whatever it had been it was no more at hand. Whatever its consequences, time would close over them; they would all in a few years be as if they had never been, and she herself grassed down and forgotten.

<div class="line_en">She might have seen that what had bowed her head so profoundly -- the thought of the world's concern at her situation was founded on an illusion. She was not an existence, an experience, a passion, a structure of sensations, to anybody but herself. To all humankind besides Tess was only a passing thought. Even to friends she was no more than a frequently passing thought. If she made herself miserable the livelong night and day it was only this much to them --'Ah, she makes herself unhappy.' If she tried to be cheerful, to dismiss all care, to take pleasure in the daylight, the flowers, the baby, she could only be this idea to them -- 'Ah, she bears it very well.' Moreover, alone in a desert island would she have been wretched at what had happened to her? Not greatly. If she could have been but just created to discover herself as a spouseless mother, with no experience of life except as the parent of a nameless child, would the position have caused her to despair? No, she would have taken it calmly, and found pleasures therein. Most of the misery had been generated by her conventional aspect, and not by her innate sensations.</div>

This was why she had borne herself with dignity, and had looked people calmly in the face at times, even when holding the baby in her arms.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the afternoon and evening the proceedings of the morning were continued, Tess staying on till dusk with the body of harvesters. Then they all rode home in one of the largest waggons, in the company of a broad tarnished moon that had risen from the ground to the eastwards, its face resembling the outworn goldleaf halo of some worm-eaten Tuscan saint. Tess's female companions sang songs, and showed themselves very sympathetic and glad at her reappearance out of doors, though they could not refrain from mischievously throwing in a few verses of the ballad about the maid who went to the merry green wood and came back a changed state. There are counterpoises and compensations in life; and the event which had made of her a social warning had also for the moment made her the most interesting personage in the village to many. Their friendliness won her still farther away from herself, their lively spirits were contagious, and she became almost gay.</div>

<div class="line_en">Tess had drifted into a frame of mind which accepted passively the consideration that if she should have to burn for what she had done, burn she must, and there was an end of it. Like all village girls she was well grounded in the Holy Scriptures, and had dutifully studied the histories of Aholah and Aholibah, and knew the inferences to be drawn therefrom. But when the same question arose with regard to the baby, it had a very different colour. Her darling was about to die, and no salvation.</div>

<div class="line_en">The baby's offence against society in coming into the world was forgotten by the girl-mother; her soul's desire was to continue that offence by preserving the life of the child. However, it soon grew clear that the hour of emancipation for that little prisoner of the flesh was to arrive earlier than her worst misgivings had conjectured.

No parson should come inside his door, he declared, prying into his affairs, just then, when, by her shame, it had become more necessary than ever to hide them.

The clock struck the solemn hour of one, that hour when fancy stalks outside reason, and malignant possibilities stand rock-firm as facts.

While the children, scarcely awake, awe-stricken at her manner, their eyes growing larger and larger, remained in this position, she took the baby from her bed -- a child's child -- so immature as scarce to seem a sufficient personality to endow its producer with the maternal title.

The ecstasy of faith almost apotheosized her; it set upon her face a glowing irradiation, and brought a red spot into the middle of each cheek; while the miniature candle-flame inverted in her eye-pupils shone like a diamond.

<div class="line_en">So the baby was carried in a small deal box, under an ancient woman's shawl, to the churchyard that night, and buried by lantern-light, at the cost of a shilling and a pint of beer to the sexton, in that shabby corner of God's allotment where He lets the nettles grow, and where all unbaptized infants, notorious drunkards, suicides, and others of the conjecturally damned are laid. In spite of the untoward surroundings, however, Tess bravely made a little cross of two laths and a piece of string, and having bound it with flowers, she stuck it up at the head of the grave one evening when she could enter the churchyard without being seen, putting at the foot also a bunch of the same flowers in a little jar of water to keep them alive. What matter was it that on the outside of the jar the eye of mere observation noted the words 'Keelwell's Marmalade'? The eye of maternal affection did not see them in its vision of higher things.</div>
