<div class="line_en">I walked past the mountain laurels and the Japanese maple, up the bluestone steps of Morrie's house. The white rain gutter hung like a lid over the doorway. I rang the bell and was greeted not by Connie but by Morrie's wife, Charlotte, a beautiful gray haired woman who spoke in a lilting voice. She was not often at home when I came by -- she continued working at MIT, as Morrie wished -- and I was surprised this morning to see her.</div>

<div class="line_en">Again, she gave that faraway look, the tuning in something from somewhere else. I knew Morrie's nights were becoming difficult, that he didn't sleep through them, and that meant Charlotte often did not sleep through them either. Sometimes Morrie would lie awake coughing for hours -- it would take that long to get the phlegm from his throat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她的眼神又一次恍惚起来。我知道莫里晚上睡觉很成问题，他常常无法入睡，这就意味着夏洛特也时常睡不好。有时， 莫里会躺着咳上几个小时——才能把痰咳出喉咙。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There were health care workers now staying through the night and all those visitors during the day, former students, fellow professors, meditation teachers, tramping in and out of the house.

She handled it with patience, even though all these outsiders were soaking up her precious minutes with Morrie.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们现在请了夜间护理，白天又不断有来访者：以前的学生，同事，默念师，穿梭不停地进出这幢房子。有时，莫里会一下子接待五六个人，而且常常是当夏洛特下班回家以后。虽然这么多的外人占用了她和莫里在一起的宝贵时间，但夏洛特仍显得很有耐心。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I helped put the new food inside the refrigerator. The kitchen counter had all kinds of notes, messages, information, medical instructions. The table held more pill bottles than ever -- Selestone for his asthma, Ativan to help him sleep, naproxen for infections -- along with a powdered milk mix and laxatives. From down the hall, we heard the sound of a door open.</div>

<div class="line_en">The small horrors of his illness were growing, and when I finally sat down with Morrie, he was coughing more than usual, a dry, dusty cough that shook his chest and made his head jerk forward.

If you hold back on the emotions -- if you don't allow yourself to go all the way through them -- you can never get to being detached, you're too busy being afraid.

<div class="line_en">Morrie talked about his most fearful moments, when he felt his chest locked in heaving surges or when he wasn't sure where his next breath would come from. These were horrifying times, he said, and his first emotions were horror, fear, anxiety. But once he recognized the feel of those emotions, their texture, their moisture, the shiver down the back, the quick flash of heat that crosses your brain -- then he was able to say, "Okay. This is fear. Step away from it. Step away."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title='莫里谈到了最让他害怕的时刻：剧烈的喘气使他透不过气来，他不知道还有没有第二口气能接上去。这是最让人害怕的时刻，他说，他最初的感情便是恐惧。害怕和担心。但当他认识了这些感情的内容和特征——背部的颤抖，闪过脑部的热眩——后，他便能说，"好了，这就是恐惧感。离开它。离开它一会儿。"'>查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Morrie's approach was exactly the opposite. Turn on the faucet. Wash yourself with the emotion. It won't hurt you. It will only help. If you let the fear inside, if you pull it on like a familiar shirt, then you can say to yourself, "All right, it's just fear, I don't have to let it control me. I see it for what it is."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title='莫里的态度截然相反：打开水龙头，用感情来冲洗。它不会伤害你。它只会帮助你。如果你不拒绝恐惧的进入，如果你把它当作一件常穿的衬衫穿上，那么你就能对自己说，"好吧，这仅仅是恐惧，我不必受它的支配。我能直面它。"'>查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I thought about how often this was needed in everyday life. How we feel lonely, sometimes to the point of tears, but we don't let those tears come because we are not supposed to cry. Or how we feel a surge of love for a partner but we don't say anything because we're frozen with the fear of what those words might do to the relationship.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我在想，日常生活中是多么地需要这样的感情处理。我们常感到孤独，有时孤独得想哭，但我们却不让泪水淌下来，因为我们觉得不该哭泣。有时我们从心里对伴侣涌起一股爱的激流，但我们却不去表达，因为我们害怕那些话语可能会带来的伤害。">查看中文翻译</div>

I instinctively pulled him forward and slapped the back of his shoulders, and he pushed a tissue to his mouth and spit out a wad of phlegm.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然，他的呼吸急促了。他肺部的淤积物似乎在捉弄他，忽而涌上来，忽而沉下去，吞噬着他的呼吸。他大口大口地喘气，然后是一阵猛烈的干咳，连手也抖动起来——他闭着眼睛双手抖动的样子简直就像是中了邪——我感到自己的额头上沁出了汗珠。我本能地把他拉起来，用手拍打他的背部，他把手中纸递到嘴边，吐出了一口痰。">查看中文翻译</div>
