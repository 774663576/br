<meta content="会长先生，诸位：（这是作者1837年8月31日在哈佛大学的演讲。这篇演讲在文化界、思想界产生了极大影响，被誉为美国知识界的“独立宣言”。）在又一个文学年开始之际，我真诚地向你们致敬。我们过去的一周年是充满希望的、但或许也是努力尚且不够的一年。我们的相聚，并非要像古希腊人那样，仅仅是为了进行力量和技巧的较量，或者是朗诵史诗、悲剧或颂词，也不是为了像中世纪行吟诗人那样为爱情和诗歌而聚集，更不是像当代在英国和欧洲各国首都的同时代人，为科学的进步举行聚会。迄今为止，我们聚会的庆典还仅仅是一个友善的象征，它证明了我们这个民族虽然过于忙碌而无心创作文学作品，却依然保持着对文学的热爱。尽管如此，这个象征也弥足珍贵，就像不能被消除的人类本能。也许这样的时代已经到来，但是它应当更进一步，并且得到更新。在这样的时代里，这个大陆的沉睡的心智睁开惺松睡眼，它给这世界带来期盼已久的贡献，这贡献远胜于机械技巧的发明。我们依赖他人的日子，我们心智向其他国家智慧学习的学徒期，就要结束了。成百万簇拥着我们涌向新生活的同胞，他们不可能永远地满足于食用异国智慧收获的陈粮。全新的事件和行动正在发生，这一切需要被歌颂，它们也要歌颂自己。有谁会怀疑诗歌将会复兴，并将引领一个新时代，就像天文学家所预言，在我们的天穹之顶的天琴大星将会成为横亘千年的新北极星。" name="description">

<div class="line_en">I GREET you on the re-commencement of our literary year. Our anniversary is one of hope, and, perhaps, not enough of labor. We do not meet for games of strength or skill, for the recitation of histories, tragedies, and odes, like the ancient Greeks; for parliaments of love and poesy, like the Troubadours; nor for the advancement of science, like our cotemporaries in the British and European capitals. Thus far, our holiday has been simply a friendly sign of the survival of the love of letters amongst a people too busy to give to letters any more. As such, it is precious as the sign of an indestructible instinct. Perhaps the time is already come, when it ought to be, and will be, something else; when the sluggard intellect of this continent will look from under its iron lids, and fill the postponed expectation of the world with something better than the exertions of mechanical skill. Our day of dependence, our long apprenticeship to the learning of other lands, draws to a close. The millions, that around us are rushing into life, cannot always be fed on the sere remains of foreign harvests. Events, actions arise, that must be sung, that will sing themselves. Who can doubt, that poetry will revive and lead in a new age, as the star in the constellation Harp, which now flames in our zenith, astronomers announce, shall one day be the pole-star for a thousand years?</div>

<div class="line_en">The old fable covers a doctrine ever new and sublime; that there is One Man, -- present to all particular men only partially, or through one faculty; and that you must take the whole society to find the whole man. Man is not a farmer, or a professor, or an engineer, but he is all. Man is priest, and scholar, and statesman, and producer, and soldier. In the divided or social state, these functions are parcelled out to individuals, each of whom aims to do his stint of the joint work, whilst each other performs his. The fable implies, that the individual, to possess himself, must sometimes return from his own labor to embrace all the other laborers. But unfortunately, this original unit, this fountain of power, has been so distributed to multitudes, has been so minutely subdivided and peddled out, that it is spilled into drops, and cannot be gathered. The state of society is one in which the members have suffered amputation from the trunk, and strut about so many walking monsters,-- a good finger, a neck, a stomach, an elbow, but never a man.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这则古老的寓言蕴涵着一个永远新颖而高尚的信念，这就是：“人”只是部分地存在于所有特殊的个人之中，或通过一种禀赋来体现；但只有观察整个社会才能找到他的全部。这个“人”不是农夫，不是教授或工程师，他是他们的总和。这个人是传教士，他是学者，他是政治家，他是生产者也是战士。这些功能在分工的社会形态里被一一分给不同的个体。每一个个体从事着整体中他那一部分的工作，人们都各司其职。这则寓言即指：个体人为了体验那“人”，一定要经常地从他自己的工作里脱离，去体味整体的其他部分。但是很不幸，这个初始的整体，这个力量的源泉，已被分散给大众，它被分得细而又细，那源泉被分离为涓滴再也无法汇集了。这种社会状态，就像支体与躯干分离，一个完整的手指，一段脖子，一只胃，一个臂肘，如鬼魅般到处踆巡，但从来看不到一个完整的人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In this distribution of functions, the scholar is the delegated intellect. In the right state, he is, Man Thinking. In the degenerate state, when the victim of society, he tends to become a mere thinker, or, still worse, the parrot of other men's thinking.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在这种分工中，学者成了被分派出来的知识代表。在正常状态下，他是“人”，他在思考。在目前退化的状态下，他成为分工社会的牺牲品，只是纯粹的思想者，或者更糟，成为他人思想的学舌鹦鹉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Man is thus metamorphosed into a thing, into many things. The planter, who is Man sent out into the field to gather food, is seldom cheered by any idea of the true dignity of his ministry. He sees his bushel and his cart, and nothing beyond, and sinks into the farmer, instead of Man on the farm. The tradesman scarcely ever gives an ideal worth to his work, but is ridden by the routine of his craft, and the soul is subject to dollars. The priest becomes a form; the attorney, a statute-book; the mechanic, a machine; the sailor, a rope of a ship.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="人因而变成了某种物，变形成为众多的物。农夫的工作是走入田野采集食物，但他不因高贵的事业而受颂扬。他看到的，除了他的筐子和他的推车再无旁物，于是他降格为一个农夫，“人”消失了。商人从未意识到他工作的真正价值，他埋头于那行当的点滴中把灵魂交给金钱。牧师成为形式，律师变成了僵死法典，机械师退化成机器，水手仅仅是一条船上的缆绳。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In this view of him, as Man Thinking, the theory of his office is contained. Him nature solicits with all her placid, all her monitory pictures; him the past instructs; him the future invites. Is not, indeed, every man a student, and do not all things exist for the student's behoof? And, finally, is not the true scholar the only true master? But the old oracle said, 'All things have two handles: beware of the wrong one.' In life, too often, the scholar errs with mankind and forfeits his privilege. Let us see him in his school, and consider him in reference to the main influences he receives.</div>

<div class="line_en">I. The first in time and the first in importance of the influences upon the mind is that of nature. Every day, the sun; and, after sunset, night and her stars. Ever the winds blow; ever the grass grows. Every day, men and women, conversing, beholding and beholden. The scholar is he of all men whom this spectacle most engages. He must settle its value in his mind. What is nature to him? There is never a beginning, there is never an end, to the inexplicable continuity of this web of God, but always circular power returning into itself. Therein it resembles his own spirit, whose beginning, whose ending, he never can find,-- so entire, so boundless. Far, too, as her splendors shine, system on system shooting like rays, upward, downward, without centre, without circumference, -- in the mass and in the particle, nature hastens to render account of herself to the mind. Classification begins. To the young mind, every thing is individual, stands by itself. By and by, it finds how to join two things, and see in them one nature; then three, then three thousand; and so, tyrannized over by its own unifying instinct, it goes on tying things together, diminishing anomalies, discovering roots running under ground, whereby contrary and remote things cohere, and flower out from one stem. It presently learns, that, since the dawn of history, there has been a constant accumulation and classifying of facts. But what is classification but the perceiving that these objects are not chaotic, and are not foreign, but have a law which is also a law of the human mind? The astronomer discovers that geometry, a pure abstraction of the human mind, is the measure of planetary motion. The chemist finds proportions and intelligible method throughout matter; and science is nothing but the finding of analogy, identity, in the most remote parts. The ambitious soul sits down before each refractory fact; one after another, reduces all strange constitutions, all new powers, to their class and their law, and goes on for ever to animate the last fibre of organization, the outskirts of nature, by insight.</div>

<div class="line_en">Thus to him, to this school-boy under the bending dome of day, is suggested, that he and it proceed from one root; one is leaf and one is flower; relation, sympathy, stirring in every vein. And what is that Root? Is not that the soul of his soul? -- A thought too bold, -- a dream too wild. Yet when this spiritual light shall have revealed the law of more earthly natures, -- when he has learned to worship the soul, and to see that the natural philosophy that now is, is only the first gropings of its gigantic hand, he shall look forward to an ever expanding knowledge as to a becoming creator. He shall see, that nature is the opposite of the soul, answering to it part for part. One is seal, and one is print. Its beauty is the beauty of his own mind. Its laws are the laws of his own mind. Nature then becomes to him the measure of his attainments. So much of nature as he is ignorant of, so much of his own mind does he not yet possess. And, in fine, the ancient precept, "Know thyself," and the modern precept, "Study nature," become at last one maxim.</div>

<div class="line_en">The theory of books is noble. The scholar of the first age received into him the world around; brooded thereon; gave it the new arrangement of his own mind, and uttered it again. It came into him, life; it went out from him, truth. It came to him, short-lived actions; it went out from him, immortal thoughts. It came to him, business; it went from him, poetry. It was dead fact; now, it is quick thought. It can stand, and it can go. It now endures, it now flies, it now inspires. Precisely in proportion to the depth of mind from which it issued, so high does it soar, so long does it sing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="书籍的原理是高贵的。古代最初的学者接触他周围的世界，并开始思考，接着对这一切重新加以安排，再重新表述出来。进入他头脑的是生活，从那里产生的是真知；进入他头脑的是瞬间的事件，从中产生的是不朽的思想，进入他头脑的是日常活动，从中产生的是诗歌；曾经是僵死的事实，一变而为活跃的思想。这思想可能静止也可以前行。它有了持久的生命，它开始飞翔，它开始感召。它与孕育自己的心灵深度恰成正比，它飞得有多高，就会唱得有多久。">查看中文翻译</div>

The next great influence into the spirit of the scholar, is, the mind of the Past, -- in whatever form, whether of literature, of art, of institutions, that mind is inscribed.

<div class="line_en">Or, I might say, it depends on how far the process had gone, of transmuting life into truth. In proportion to the completeness of the distillation, so will the purity and imperishableness of the product be. But none is quite perfect. As no air-pump can by any means make a perfect vacuum, so neither can any artist entirely exclude the conventional, the local, the perishable from his book, or write a book of pure thought, that shall be as efficient, in all respects, to a remote posterity, as to cotemporaries, or rather to the second age. Each age, it is found, must write its own books; or rather, each generation for the next succeeding. The books of an older period will not fit this.</div>

<div class="line_en">Yet hence arises a grave mischief. The sacredness which attaches to the act of creation, -- the act of thought, -- is transferred to the record. The poet chanting, was felt to be a divine man: henceforth the chant is divine also. The writer was a just and wise spirit: henceforward it is settled, the book is perfect; as love of the hero corrupts into worship of his statue. Instantly, the book becomes noxious: the guide is a tyrant. The sluggish and perverted mind of the multitude, slow to open to the incursions of Reason, having once so opened, having once received this book, stands upon it, and makes an outcry, if it is disparaged. Colleges are built on it. Books are written on it by thinkers, not by Man Thinking; by men of talent, that is, who start wrong, who set out from accepted dogmas, not from their own sight of principles. Meek young men grow up in libraries, believing it their duty to accept the views, which Cicero, which Locke, which Bacon, have given, forgetful that Cicero, Locke, and Bacon were only young men in libraries, when they wrote these books.</div>

This every man is entitled to; this every man contains within him, although, in almost all men, obstructed, and as yet unborn. The soul active sees absolute truth; and utters truth, or creates. In this action, it is genius; not the privilege of here and there a favorite, but the sound estate of every man. In its essence, it is progressive. The book, the college, the school of art, the institution of any kind, stop with some past utterance of genius. This is good, say they, -- let us hold by this. They pin me down. They look backward and not forward. But genius looks forward: the eyes of man are set in his forehead, not in his hindhead: man hopes: genius creates. Whatever talents may be, if the man create not, the pure efflux of the Deity is not his; -- cinders and smoke there may be, but not yet flame.

<div class="line_en">Undoubtedly there is a right way of reading, so it be sternly subordinated. Man Thinking must not be subdued by his instruments. Books are for the scholar's idle times. When he can read God directly, the hour is too precious to be wasted in other men's transcripts of their readings.

<div class="line_en">It is remarkable, the character of the pleasure we derive from the best books. They impress us with the conviction, that one nature wrote and the same reads. We read the verses of one of the great English poets, of Chaucer, of Marvell, of Dryden, with the most modern joy,-- with a pleasure, I mean, which is in great part caused by the abstraction of all time from their verses. There is some awe mixed with the joy of our surprise, when this poet, who lived in some past world, two or three hundred years ago, says that which lies close to my own soul, that which I also had wellnigh thought and said. But for the evidence thence afforded to the philosophical doctrine of the identity of all minds, we should suppose some preëstablished harmony, some foresight of souls that were to be, and some preparation of stores for their future wants, like the fact observed in insects, who lay up food before death for the young grub they shall never see.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们从阅读优秀书籍中获得的乐趣确实值得一提。这些书籍让我们深信，一个自然写作，另一个自然阅读。我们带着现代的兴趣阅读伟大英语诗歌作者——乔叟、马韦尔、德莱顿——的作品，我是说，这乐趣源于他们诗歌中超越时代的精髓。在我们阅读的乐趣里也包涵着敬畏和惊叹，这位生活于两三百年前的诗人，创造出如此贴近我心灵的诗篇，几如我所思所写。仅为支持哲学有关人脑同一性的信念，我们就应有某些已确立的和谐，一些对心智属性的洞察和对某种未来需求所做的准备——就像我们观察到的，昆虫在死去之前总是为自己永远看不到的后代准备好食物。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I would not be hurried by any love of system, by any exaggeration of instincts, to underrate the Book. We all know, that, as the human body can be nourished on any food, though it were boiled grass and the broth of shoes, so the human mind can be fed by any knowledge. And great and heroic men have existed, who had almost no other information than by the printed page. I only would say, that it needs a strong head to bear that diet. One must be an inventor to read well. As the proverb says, "He that would bring home the wealth of the Indies, must carry out the wealth of the Indies." There is then creative reading as well as creative writing. When the mind is braced by labor and invention, the page of whatever book we read becomes luminous with manifold allusion. Every sentence is doubly significant, and the sense of our author is as broad as the world. We then see, what is always true, that, as the seer's hour of vision is short and rare among heavy days and months, so is its record, perchance, the least part of his volume. The discerning will read, in his Plato or Shakspeare, only that least part, -- only the authentic utterances of the oracle; -- all the rest he rejects, were it never so many times Plato's and Shakspeare's.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我不会贬低书籍的作用，尽管有对独立体系的喜爱或夸大直觉的冲动。我们都知道，如同身体可以得到食物的滋养，这食物可能是煮烂的植物也可能是废料杂碎，人脑也可以吸收各种知识。伟大的英雄人物曾经存在过，他们几乎全部的知识，都是从书本里得到的。我仅需指出的是，要有足够强大的头脑来消化这些知识。善于发现的人才会善于读书，诚如成语所言：“若想带回印第安人的财宝，一定要先学会他们的智慧。”即有创造性的写作也有创造性的阅读。当大脑沉浸于劳作和发明时，无论我们在阅读什么，它都会放射出照亮事物多层蕴意的光芒。这时候，每句话都显示出双倍的重要，我们作者的感官会像世界般宽阔。我们这时明白了这样的真实，那预言者在岁月重压下的洞察是短暂而稀罕的，对它的记录也必如是，也许就是卷册中的几页。洞察的双眼在柏拉图和莎士比亚的著述中只读到那几页——那仅有的真正神喻——其他的都可视而不见，好像它们不是世代相传的柏拉图或莎士比亚的著作。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Of course, there is a portion of reading quite indispensable to a wise man. History and exact science he must learn by laborious reading. Colleges, in like manner, have their indispensable office, -- to teach elements. But they can only highly serve us, when they aim not to drill, but to create; when they gather from far every ray of various genius to their hospitable halls, and, by the concentrated fires, set the hearts of their youth on flame. Thought and knowledge are natures in which apparatus and pretension avail nothing. Gowns, and pecuniary foundations, though of towns of gold, can never countervail the least sentence or syllable of wit. Forget this, and our American colleges will recede in their public importance, whilst they grow richer every year.</div>

<div class="line_en">III. There goes in the world a notion, that the scholar should be a recluse, a valetudinarian, -- as unfit for any handiwork or public labor, as a penknife for an axe. The so-called 'practical men' sneer at speculative men, as if, because they speculate or see, they could do nothing. I have heard it said that the clergy, -- who are always, more universally than any other class, the scholars of their day, -- are addressed as women; that the rough, spontaneous conversation of men they do not hear, but only a mincing and diluted speech. They are often virtually disfranchised; and, indeed, there are advocates for their celibacy. As far as this is true of the studious classes, it is not just and wise. Action is with the scholar subordinate, but it is essential. Without it, he is not yet man. Without it, thought can never ripen into truth. Whilst the world hangs before the eye as a cloud of beauty, we cannot even see its beauty. Inaction is cowardice, but there can be no scholar without the heroic mind. The preamble of thought, the transition through which it passes from the unconscious to the conscious, is action. Only so much do I know, as I have lived. Instantly we know whose words are loaded with life, and whose not.</div>

Henceforth it is an object of beauty, however base its origin and neighborhood. Observe, too, the impossibility of antedating this act. In its grub state, it cannot fly, it cannot shine, it is a dull grub. But suddenly, without observation, the selfsame thing unfurls beautiful wings, and is an angel of wisdom.

Flamsteed and Herschel, in their glazed observatories, may catalogue the stars with the praise of all men, and, the results being splendid and useful, honor is sure. But he, in his private observatory, cataloguing obscure and nebulous stars of the human mind, which as yet no man has thought of as such, -- watching days and months, sometimes, for a few facts; correcting still his old records; -- must relinquish display and immediate fame. In the long period of his preparation, he must betray often an ignorance and shiftlessness in popular arts, incurring the disdain of the able who shoulder him aside. Long he must stammer in his speech; often forego the living for the dead. Worse yet, he must accept, -- how often! poverty and solitude.

Success treads on every right step. For the instinct is sure, that prompts him to tell his brother what he thinks. He then learns, that in going down into the secrets of his own mind, he has descended into the secrets of all minds. He learns that he who has mastered any law in his private thoughts, is master to that extent of all men whose language he speaks, and of all into whose language his own can be translated. The poet, in utter solitude remembering his spontaneous thoughts and recording them, is found to have recorded that, which men in crowded cities find true for them also.

<div class="line_en">In self-trust, all the virtues are comprehended. Free should the scholar be, -- free and brave. Free even to the definition of freedom, "without any hindrance that does not arise out of his own constitution." Brave; for fear is a thing, which a scholar by his very function puts behind him. Fear always springs from ignorance. It is a shame to him if his tranquillity, amid dangerous times, arise from the presumption, that, like children and women, his is a protected class; or if he seek a temporary peace by the diversion of his thoughts from politics or vexed questions, hiding his head like an ostrich in the flowering bushes, peeping into microscopes, and turning rhymes, as a boy whistles to keep his courage up. So is the danger a danger still; so is the fear worse. Manlike let him turn and face it. Let him look into its eye and search its nature, inspect its origin, -- see the whelping of this lion, -- which lies no great way back; he will then find in himself a perfect comprehension of its nature and extent; he will have made his hands meet on the other side, and can henceforth defy it, and pass on superior. The world is his, who can see through its pretension. What deafness, what stone-blind custom, what overgrown error you behold, is there only by sufferance, -- by your sufferance. See it to be a lie, and you have already dealt it its mortal blow.</div>

As the world was plastic and fluid in the hands of God, so it is ever to so much of his attributes as we bring to it. To ignorance and sin, it is flint. They adapt themselves to it as they may; but in proportion as a man has any thing in him divine, the firmament flows before him and takes his signet and form. Not he is great who can alter matter, but he who can alter my state of mind. They are the kings of the world who give the color of their present thought to all nature and all art, and persuade men by the cheerful serenity of their carrying the matter, that this thing which they do, is the apple which the ages have desired to pluck, now at last ripe, and inviting nations to the harvest. The great man makes the great thing. Wherever Macdonald sits, there is the head of the table. Linnæus makes botany the most alluring of studies, and wins it from the farmer and the herb-woman; Davy, chemistry; and Cuvier, fossils.

But I have already shown the ground of my hope, in adverting to the doctrine that man is one. I believe man has been wronged; he has wronged himself. He has almost lost the light, that can lead him back to his prerogatives. Men are become of no account. Men in history, men in the world of to-day are bugs, are spawn, and are called 'the mass' and 'the herd.' In a century, in a millennium, one or two men; that is to say, -- one or two approximations to the right state of every man. All the rest behold in the hero or the poet their own green and crude being, -- ripened; yes, and are content to be less, so that may attain to its full stature. What a testimony, -- full of grandeur, full of pity, is borne to the demands of his own nature, by the poor clansman, the poor partisan, who rejoices in the glory of his chief. The poor and the low find some amends to their immense moral capacity, for their acquiescence in a political and social inferiority. They are content to be brushed like flies from the path of a great person, so that justice shall be done by him to that common nature which it is the dearest desire of all to see enlarged and glorified. They sun themselves in the great man's light, and feel it to be their own element.

Wake them, and they shall quit the false good, and leap to the true, and leave governments to clerks and desks. This revolution is to be wrought by the gradual domestication of the idea of Culture. The main enterprise of the world for splendor, for extent, is the upbuilding of a man. Here are the materials strown along the ground. The private life of one man shall be a more illustrious monarchy, -- more formidable to its enemy, more sweet and serene in its influence to its friend, than any kingdom in history. For a man, rightly viewed, comprehendeth the particular natures of all men. Each philosopher, each bard, each actor, has only done for me, as by a delegate, what one day I can do for myself. The books which once we valued more than the apple of the eye, we have quite exhausted. What is that but saying, that we have come up with the point of view which the universal mind took through the eyes of one scribe; we have been that man, and have passed on. First, one; then, another; we drain all cisterns, and, waxing greater by all these supplies, we crave a better and more abundant food. The man has never lived that can feed us ever. The human mind cannot be enshrined in a person, who shall set a barrier on any one side to this unbounded, unboundable empire. It is one central fire, which, flaming now out of the lips of Etna, lightens the capes of Sicily; and, now out of the throat of Vesuvius, illuminates the towers and vineyards of Naples.

<div class="line_en">One of these signs is the fact, that the same movement which effected the elevation of what was called the lowest class in the state, assumed in literature a very marked and as benign an aspect. Instead of the sublime and beautiful; the near, the low, the common, was explored and poetized. That, which had been negligently trodden under foot by those who were harnessing and provisioning themselves for long journeys into far countries, is suddenly found to be richer than all foreign parts. The literature of the poor, the feelings of the child, the philosophy of the street, the meaning of household life, are the topics of the time. It is a great stride. It is a sign, -- is it not? of new vigor, when the extremities are made active, when currents of warm life run into the hands and the feet. I ask not for the great, the remote, the romantic; what is doing in Italy or Arabia; what is Greek art, or Provençal minstrelsy; I embrace the common, I explore and sit at the feet of the familiar, the low. Give me insight into to-day, and you may have the antique and future worlds. What would we really know the meaning of? The meal in the firkin; the milk in the pan; the ballad in the street; the news of the boat; the glance of the eye; the form and the gait of the body; -- show me the ultimate reason of these matters; show me the sublime presence of the highest spiritual cause lurking, as always it does lurk, in these suburbs and extremities of nature; let me see every trifle bristling with the polarity that ranges it instantly on an eternal law; and the shop, the plough, and the leger, referred to the like cause by which light undulates and poets sing; -- and the world lies no longer a dull miscellany and lumber-room, but has form and order; there is no trifle; there is no puzzle; but one design unites and animates the farthest pinnacle and the lowest trench.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="其中一种象征是这样一个事实：那种致力于提高国内所谓下等阶级的运动，已经在文学中得到了显著的反映，并且开始初具雏形。崇高与美不再被讴歌，作家们探寻和开采的是那些卑俗而低下的眼前生活。一度被急于远赴他国获取养料的作家踩在脚下、不屑一顾的材料，如今突然被人发现远比一切异国情调都更加丰富多彩。穷人的文学，儿童的情感，街头哲学，以及家庭生活的意义，这些都成了当今的话题。这是巨大的进步。这是个标志——难道不是吗？它标志着一种新鲜活力，这种活力使生活的各个角落活跃起来，并把生命的热流注入每只手、每只脚。我不追求伟大、幽远或浪漫的题材，如意大利或阿拉伯发生的一切，或古希腊艺术，或是法国普罗旺斯的吟游诗歌。我推崇平凡，探索并且亲近我所熟知的、卑微的一切。给我洞察今天的力量吧，让别人去拥有古代和未来的世界吧。究竟何种事物的意义是为我们所知的？是盘中餐，是杯中奶，是街头小调，船上的新闻，眼神的一瞥，以及人的体形与步态的内涵——让我看看这些事物存在的终极理由，让我看看总是潜伏在自然的各个角落和灌木丛中的最高贵的精神因素的高贵存在吧，让我看看所有受到万有引力这一永恒法则支配着的活跃的琐事吧。商店、篱笆、账簿，它们都与自然定律有关，而依据同样的定律，光线变换着亮度，诗人发出歌声——于是，这个世界不再像一间堆满杂物的单调仓库，而是成了井然有序、条理清晰的空间；它不再有零屑杂物，也不再有复杂难解的东西，而是具有统一性并推动着所有高低不等行进的设施。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This idea has inspired the genius of Goldsmith, Burns, Cowper, and, in a newer time, of Goethe, Wordsworth, and Carlyle. This idea they have differently followed and with various success. In contrast with their writing, the style of Pope, of Johnson, of Gibbon, looks cold and pedantic. This writing is blood-warm. Man is surprised to find that things near are not less beautiful and wondrous than things remote. The near explains the far. The drop is a small ocean. A man is related to all nature. This perception of the worth of the vulgar is fruitful in discoveries. Goethe, in this very thing the most modern of the moderns, has shown us, as none ever did, the genius of the ancients.</div>

<div class="line_en">There is one man of genius, who has done much for this philosophy of life, whose literary value has never yet been rightly estimated; -- I mean Emanuel Swedenborg. The most imaginative of men, yet writing with the precision of a mathematician, he endeavored to engraft a purely philosophical Ethics on the popular Christianity of his time. Such an attempt, of course, must have difficulty, which no genius could surmount. But he saw and showed the connection between nature and the affections of the soul. He pierced the emblematic or spiritual character of the visible, audible, tangible world. Especially did his shade-loving muse hover over and interpret the lower parts of nature; he showed the mysterious bond that allies moral evil to the foul material forms, and has given in epical parables a theory of insanity, of beasts, of unclean and fearful things.</div>

<div class="line_en">Another sign of our times, also marked by an analogous political movement, is, the new importance given to the single person. Every thing that tends to insulate the individual, -- to surround him with barriers of natural respect, so that each man shall feel the world is his, and man shall treat with man as a sovereign state with a sovereign state; -- tends to true union as well as greatness. "I learned," said the melancholy Pestalozzi, "that no man in God's wide earth is either willing or able to help any other man." Help must come from the bosom alone. The scholar is that man who must take up into himself all the ability of the time, all the contributions of the past, all the hopes of the future. He must be an university of knowledges. If there be one lesson more than another, which should pierce his ear, it is, The world is nothing, the man is all; in yourself is the law of all nature, and you know not yet how a globule of sap ascends; in yourself slumbers the whole of Reason; it is for you to know all, it is for you to dare all. Mr. President and Gentlemen, this confidence in the unsearched might of man belongs, by all motives, by all prophecy, by all preparation, to the American Scholar. We have listened too long to the courtly muses of Europe. The spirit of the American freeman is already suspected to be timid, imitative, tame. Public and private avarice make the air we breathe thick and fat. The scholar is decent, indolent, complaisant. See already the tragic consequence. The mind of this country, taught to aim at low objects, eats upon itself. There is no work for any but the decorous and the complaisant. Young men of the fairest promise, who begin life upon our shores, inflated by the mountain winds, shined upon by all the stars of God, find the earth below not in unison with these, -- but are hindered from action by the disgust which the principles on which business is managed inspire, and turn drudges, or die of disgust, -- some of them suicides. What is the remedy? They did not yet see, and thousands of young men as hopeful now crowding to the barriers for the career, do not yet see, that, if the single man plant himself indomitably on his instincts, and there abide, the huge world will come round to him. Patience, -- patience; -- with the shades of all the good and great for company; and for solace, the perspective of your own infinite life; and for work, the study and the communication of principles, the making those instincts prevalent, the conversion of the world. Is it not the chief disgrace in the world, not to be an unit; -- not to be reckoned one character; -- not to yield that peculiar fruit which each man was created to bear, but to be reckoned in the gross, in the hundred, or the thousand, of the party, the section, to which we belong; and our opinion predicted geographically, as the north, or the south? Not so, brothers and friends, -- please God, ours shall not be so. We will walk on our own feet; we will work with our own hands; we will speak our own minds. The study of letters shall be no longer a name for pity, for doubt, and for sensual indulgence. The dread of man and the love of man shall be a wall of defence and a wreath of joy around all. A nation of men will for the first time exist, because each believes himself inspired by the Divine Soul which also inspires all men.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们时代的另一个象征也以一场类似的政治运动为标志，它是赋予个人的一种崭新意义。一切似乎都要把人隔离开来——用自然的、尊敬的栅栏将他包围起来，这样就会让他感到世界属于他，人与人之间应像主权国家一样彼此交往。与此同时，也有种种迹象表明要将人与自然真正结合起来，使他变得伟大。忧郁的裴斯泰洛齐说：“我发现，在神的这个广袤的世界上，竟无人愿意或能够帮助别人。”这种帮助只能是发自内心的。学者必须将现在的一切能力、过去的一切贡献、未来的一切希望吸纳于己身。他应当是一座知识的宝库。如果有什么教训值得他汲取的，那这教训便是：世界微不足道，而人才是一切。你本身包含着自然界的所有法则，而你连气体上升的理论也不明白。整个理性都在你心中沉睡，你要了解一切，大胆地尝试一切。会长先生及诸位，一切动机，一切预言，一切准备都已证明，这种对于人类潜在能力的信心，属于美国的学者。我们倾听欧洲优雅的艺术女神的声音，已经为时过久。人们已经怀疑美国人的自由精神是胆怯、模仿或温顺的代名词。公众和私人的贪欲，把我们呼吸的空气弄得污浊而油腻。学者是体面的、悠闲的与谦恭的。这已经造成了一种悲惨的后果。这个国家的心灵只以低等的对象为目标，并在不停地损害自己。在这个国家，只有循规蹈矩、驯服听话的人才能找到工作。在这片国土上开始生活的那些最有希望的年轻人被山风吹拂着，上帝的所有星辰都照耀着他们。但他们却发现脚下的土地与这些不相协调。他们的行动受阻于商业理论所造成的憎恨，于是他们不得不沦为苦力，或因不堪困苦而死亡，其中一些是自杀。补救的良药在哪里？他们还没有发现；数以千计同样充满希望的年轻人，挤到求职的栅栏前，他们也没有觉悟：要是他顽固地坚守本能，固执己见，那么，偌大的世界便会反过来迁就他。忍耐，再忍耐——在一切善良和伟大的阴影中忍耐，你本人无限宽广的生活远景就是你的安慰，研究和传播原理就是你的工作，让人的本能普及开来，并且教化全世界。在这个世界上，如果你不能特立独行，不能被人当作一个有个性的人，或不能获得每个堂堂男子理应获得的成果，而是任人将我们与芸芸众生混为一谈，与成千上百的人视为一体，按我们所属的政党和地域来估价，依地理上或南或北的分布来预测我们的意见，那岂不是奇耻大辱？不能这样，弟兄们，朋友们——上天作证，我们决不可这样。我们要用自己的脚走路，要用自己的双手工作，要说出我们自己的思想。文学研究将不再是个代表怜悯、代表怀疑或仅仅代表着感官放纵的一个名词。人的恐惧，人的爱，将构成一堵防护墙和一个围绕一切快乐的花环。一个由真正的人所组成的国家将要首次出现。因为每个人都相信自己是受到了神灵的感召，而神灵也将会启示所有的人。">查看中文翻译</div>
