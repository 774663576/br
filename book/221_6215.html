<div class="line_en">To my parents, I had in four short weeks become just a few degrees more interesting. I was now the conduit to a different world. My mother, in particular, asked me daily questions about Granta House and its domestic habits in the manner of a zoologist forensically examining some strange new creature and its habitat. "Does Mrs Traynor use linen napkins at every meal?" she would ask, or "Do you think they vacuum every day, like we do?" or, "What do they do with their potatoes?"</div>

<div class="line_en">She sent me off in the mornings with strict instructions to find out what brand of loo roll they used, or whether the sheets were a polycotton mix. It was a source of great disappointment to her that most of the time I couldn't actually remember. My mother was secretly convinced that posh people lived like pigs -- ever since I had told her, aged six, of a well-spoken school friend whose mother wouldn't let us play in their front room "because we'd disturb the dust".</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="早上她送我出门时，总是千叮万嘱地让我去查明他们用的卫生卷纸是什么牌子的，他们的被单是不是涤棉混纺纱。大多数时候，我都不怎么记得去查看，很是让她失望。自从六岁时我告诉母亲，有个同学的妈妈说话得体，她告诫我们不要在他们家的前厅玩儿，因为“我们会扰乱了尘土”后，我母亲在内心就一直确信上流社会的人都养尊处优。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The thing about being catapulted into a whole new life -- or at least, shoved up so hard against someone else's life that you might as well have your face pressed against their window -- is that it forces you to rethink your idea of who you are.

<div class="line_en">To Patrick, and to my sister, I was no different -- still the butt of jokes, the recipient of hugs or kisses or sulks. I felt no different. I still looked the same, still dressed, according to Treen, like I had had a wrestling match in a charity shop.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对于帕特里克和我妹妹来说，我还是一样——仍是他们开玩笑的活靶、拥抱亲吻时的对象、闹脾气时的出气筒。我没感到任何不同。我看起来还是一样，在穿着打扮上，如特丽娜所说，就像在旧货店里参加了一场摔跤比赛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When I came home to report that, yes, the dog was definitely allowed to eat in the kitchen, or that, no, the Traynors didn't scrub their front step every day as my mother did, she would purse her lips, glance sideways at my father and nod with quiet satisfaction, as if I had just confirmed everything she'd suspected about the slovenly ways of the upper classes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当我回到家告诉他们，是的，狗确实被允许在厨房吃东西，或者，不对，他们不像母亲那样每天都擦洗台阶时，她会撅起嘴来，斜眼看向父亲，满足地点点头，就像刚刚确认了她心中的疑问，上层社会的人果然生活懒散。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I had no idea what most of the inhabitants of Granta House thought of me. Will was unreadable. To Nathan, I suspected I was just the latest in a long line of hired carers. He was friendly enough, but a bit semi-detached. I got the feeling he wasn't convinced I was going to be there for long. Mr Traynor nodded at me politely when we passed in the hall, occasionally asking me how the traffic was, or whether I had settled in all right. I'm not sure he would have recognized me if he'd been introduced to me in another setting.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我不知道格兰塔屋的人怎么看我。威尔让人难以捉摸，而对于内森，我怀疑我只是一长串被雇用的护理员中最近的一个。他足够友好，但是有点超然，我感觉他不相信我会长久待在这里。当我在大厅遇到特雷纳先生时，他总是很礼貌地对我点点头，偶尔他也问我今天的交通怎样，我适应得是否还好。如果在另一个场合我被介绍给他，我不确定他能认出我。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Their dependence on my income, or perhaps the fact that they knew I didn't really like my job, meant that I also received a little more respect within the house. This didn't actually translate to much -- in my Dad's case, it meant that he had stopped calling me "lardarse" and, in my mother's that there was usually a mug of tea waiting for me when I came home.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们要依靠我的收入过活，而或许知道我不怎么喜欢这份工作这个事实，让我在家里赢得了一点尊重。虽然这实际上并没有改变多少——在父亲那里，这意味着他不再叫我“胖子”。在母亲那里，我回家时总会有一杯茶等着我。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She thought it might be a good idea if I didn't leave Will for so long next time, no matter how awkward the situation, hmm? She thought perhaps the next time I dusted I could make sure things weren't close enough to the edge so that they might accidentally get knocked to the floor, hmm? (She seemed to prefer to believe that it had been an accident.) She made me feel like a first-class eejit, and consequently I became a first-class eejit around her. She always arrived just when I had dropped something on the floor, or was struggling with the cooker dial, or she would be standing in the hallway looking mildly irritated as I stepped back in from collecting logs outside, as if I had been gone much longer than I actually had.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她说下次最好不要让威尔一个人待这么长时间，不管情形有多尴尬，嗯？她说下次我除尘时最好不要把东西放得过于靠近边缘，这样它们就不会意外地被摔到地上，嗯？（她似乎愿意相信这是个偶然事件）她让我觉得我是个超级白痴。每次我刚把一个东西掉在地板上，或是正想办法拧开炉灶的控制器时，她就刚好进门来。我拣好木柴从外面回来时，她刚好就站在门口，看起来有点恼火，好像我比实际上出去的时间长得多。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It had started with the photo frames. Nothing in that house escaped Mrs Traynor's notice, and I should have known that the smashing of the frames would qualify as a seismic event. She quizzed me as to exactly how long I had left Will alone, what had prompted it, how swiftly I had cleared the mess up. She didn't actually criticize me -- she was too genteel even to raise her voice -- but the way she blinked slowly at my responses, her little hmm-hmm, as I spoke, told me everything I needed to know. It came as no surprise when Nathan told me she was a magistrate.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="事情要从那些相框说起。这栋房子里的任何东西都逃不过特雷纳夫人的眼睛，我早该知道这些相框被打碎会算得上是次地震。她精确地查问我让威尔一个人待了多长时间，是出于什么原因，我多快把乱七八糟的东西清理好。她并没有批评我——她教养太好，都不曾提高音量——但是对于我的回应她缓慢地眨着眼睛，小声地“嗯——嗯”，这些都告诉了我一切。内森告诉我她是个地方法官时，我一点儿也不惊讶。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was true. Will and I seemed to have found an easier way of being around each other. It revolved mainly around him being rude to me, and me occasionally being rude back. He told me I did something badly, and I told him if it really mattered to him then he could ask me nicely. He swore at me, or called me a pain in the backside, and I told him he should try being without this particular pain in the backside and see how far it got him. It was a bit forced but it seemed to work for both of us. Sometimes it even seemed like a relief to him that there was someone prepared to be rude to him, to contradict him or tell him he was being horrible. I got the feeling that everyone had tiptoed around him since his accident -- apart from perhaps Nathan, who Will seemed to treat with an automatic respect, and who was probably impervious to any of his sharper comments anyway. Nathan was like an armoured vehicle in human form.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是真的。威尔和我似乎找到了一种轻松的相处方式。他粗鲁地对待我，偶尔我也会粗鲁地予以还击。他告诉我某事没有做好，我就告诉他如果这件事真的对他很重要，他应该对我客气点。他骂我，说我是背上的芒刺，我告诉他可以假装背上没有芒刺，看这个芒刺能给他造成多大的障碍。这样做有点造作，不过似乎对我俩都有效。有人时刻准备着对他无理，抵触他，或者告诉他他太可怕了，这有时对他甚至是一种宽慰。我感觉自从他出事后，每个人都小心翼翼地对待他——除了内森，威尔对内森有一种发自心底的尊敬，不管怎样，内森都不为他那些尖锐的话语所动。内森就像一辆人形的装甲车。">查看中文翻译</div>

I hadn't minded too much when it was The Terminator -- even though I have seen all the Terminator films -- but when he showed me the French film with subtitles, I took a quick look at the cover and said I thought I'd probably give it a miss.</div>

With Nathan looking on, I guided Will's outside chair (he had a separate one for travelling) squarely on to the ramp, checked the electrical lock-down brake, and programmed it to slowly lift him up into the car. Nathan slid into the other passenger seat, belted him and secured the wheels. Trying to stop my hands from trembling, I released the handbrake and drove slowly down the drive towards the hospital.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从外表看那辆车没什么不同，不过打开后车门后，从边上垂下来一个斜坡，直接降到地面。内森在旁边看着，我指引着威尔将他的外用轮椅（他有一个旅行专用的轮椅）停在斜坡正中间，检查了电动锁刹，然后启动程序将他缓慢地吊到车里。内森溜进另一个座位，帮他系好安全带，固定好轮子。为了让手不再颤抖，我松开手闸，慢慢地驶下车道，朝医院开去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Away from home, Will appeared to shrink a little. It was chilly outside, and Nathan and I had bundled him up into his scarf and thick coat, but still he grew quieter, his jaw set, somehow diminished by the greater space of his surroundings. Every time I looked into my rear-view mirror (which was often -- I was terrified even with Nathan there that somehow the chair would break loose from its moorings) he was gazing out of the window, his expression impenetrable. Even when I stalled or braked too hard, which I did several times, he just winced a little and waited while I sorted myself out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一离开家，威尔就有些沉默。外面很冷，出门之前内森和我给他裹上了围巾，穿上了厚外套。他依然比往常沉闷得多，咬着牙关，身旁很大的空间反倒让他显得更小。每次我看向后视镜（我常看向后视镜——就算有内森在，我还是害怕他的轮椅会飞出去），他都望着窗外，表情让人猜不透。甚至我好几次刹车太猛时，他也只是抽搐了一下，等我调整好。">查看中文翻译</div>

Nathan pretended not to notice, but I saw him watching too. Will just looked grim-faced and resolute.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有些事情只有当你跟坐轮椅的人同行时才会注意到。第一件事是大部分的路面都非常糟糕，坑坑洼洼，凹凸不平。威尔转动着轮椅，我缓慢地走在他身边，我注意到每处高低不平的路都会让他痛苦地颠簸几下，他常常需要小心地转向来避开潜在的障碍物。内森假装没有注意，但是我观察到他也在看威尔。威尔面孔铁青，表情坚毅。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Good job," Nathan said, clapping me on the back as he let himself out, but I found it hard to believe it had been.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“干得好。”内森走出来时，拍了拍我的背说道。我很难相信这是事实。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The other thing is how inconsiderate most drivers are. They park up against the cutouts on the pavement, or so close together that there is no way for a wheelchair to actually cross the road. I was shocked, a couple of times even tempted to leave some rude note tucked into a windscreen wiper, but Nathan and Will seemed used to it. Nathan pointed out a suitable crossing place and, each of us flanking Will, we finally crossed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="另一件事就是大部分的司机都不怎么替别人着想，他们总是把车停在挖方旁，或是停得很紧密，没有空间可以让轮椅过马路。我很震惊，有几次都想在风挡雨刷上塞进一张纸条骂骂他们，但是内森和威尔似乎早就习惯了。内森找出了一块适合过马路的地方，我们两人在威尔左右，终于过了马路。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">By the time we reached the hospital I had actually broken out into a fine sweat. I drove around the hospital car park three times, too afraid to reverse into any but the largest of spaces, until I could sense that the two men were beginning to lose patience. Then, finally, I lowered the ramp and Nathan helped Will's chair out on to the tarmac.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到达医院时，我浑身都是汗水。我绕着医院停车场转了三圈，不敢倒车，怕位置不够大。我能感觉到车上的两个男人有些不耐烦了。终于，我放低斜坡，内森帮威尔将轮椅落在柏油马路上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The hospital itself was a gleaming low-rise building, the immaculate reception area more like that of some modernistic hotel, perhaps testament to private insurance. I held back as Will told the receptionist his name, and then followed him and Nathan down a long corridor. Nathan was carrying a huge backpack that contained anything that Will might be likely to need during his short visit, from beakers to spare clothes. He had packed it in front of me that morning, detailing every possible eventuality. "I guess it's a good thing we don't have to do this too often," he had said, catching my appalled expression.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="医院是一栋明亮的低层楼房，接待处非常整洁，看起来更像是一个现代化的酒店，或是卫生健康组织。我留在原地，威尔告诉接待员他的名字，然后我跟随他和内森向长廊那头走去。内森背着一个巨大的背包，里面装着这次短暂的出行中威尔可能会用到的所有东西，从杯子到备用衣物，应有尽有。那天早上他当着我的面收拾的包裹，并详细告诉我一切可能发生的事情。“好在我们并不是老要这么做。”看到我惊骇的表情，他说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Will had not said a single word since leaving the house.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="自从离开家以后，威尔一个字都没有说过。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I didn't follow him into the appointment. Nathan and I sat on the comfortable chairs outside the consultant's room. There was no hospital smell, and there were fresh flowers in a vase on the windowsill. Not just any old flowers, either. Huge exotic things that I didn't know the name of, artfully arranged in minimalist clumps.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我没有跟随威尔进去看医生。内森和我坐在诊疗室外面舒服的椅子上。那儿没有医院的那股味道，窗台上的花瓶里插着新鲜的花，不是什么平常的花朵，而是具有异国情调的巨大花朵，我不知道名字，美妙地插在极少的泥土中。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“那只有使他的身体状况不恶化——阻止他萎缩、骨头软化、腿淤血——之类的作用。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When he spoke again, his voice was gentle, as if he thought he might disappoint me. "He's not going to walk again, Louisa. That only happens in Hollywood movies. All we're doing is trying to keep him out of pain, and keep up whatever range of movement he has."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他再开口时，语气很柔和，似乎他认为他可能会让我失望。“他不能再走路了，露易莎。那样的情景只发生在好莱坞电影中。我们所做的一切就是让他免除痛苦，保持他现有的所有动作。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Nathan wrinkled his nose. "He does it, but I don't think his heart's in it. When I first came, he was pretty determined. He'd come pretty far in rehab, but after a year with no improvement I think he found it pretty tough to keep believing it was worth it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="内森皱了皱鼻子：“他做理疗，但我不认为他放了心思进去。我第一次来时，他决心很大。费很大心思做康复治疗。但是过了一年，一点进展都没有，我想他也觉得很难再相信这些有用吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Nathan stared at the floor. "Honestly? He's a C5/6 quadriplegic. That means nothing works below about here…" He placed a hand on the upper part of his chest. "They haven't worked out how to fix a spinal cord yet."</div>

"There are all sorts of medical advances taking place, though, right? I mean… somewhere like this… they must be working on stuff all the time."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我盯着门，想起在冬天的阳光里一路行驶过来的威尔的表情，想起在滑雪天春风满面的那个男人。“可是各种各样的医学进展都在发生，对吗？我是说……也许在某个地方……他们一直在努力解决这个问题。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“这是一家相当好的医院。”他淡然地说道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Perhaps predictably, I got lost trying to find my way back to the corridor and had to ask several nurses where I should go, two of whom didn't even know. When I got there, the coffee cooling in my hand, the corridor was empty. As I drew closer, I could see the consultant's door was ajar. I hesitated outside, but I could hear Mrs Traynor's voice in my ears all the time now, criticizing me for leaving him. I had done it again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如我所料，在找路回走廊时我迷路了，不得不问了几个护士，其中两个都不知道该怎么走。当我到那儿时，手上的咖啡已经凉了，走廊是空的。再走近一点，我发现诊疗室的门半开着。我在外面犹豫了一会儿，耳朵里一直是特雷纳夫人的声音，批评我扔下他。我又一次犯错了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I went to get a coffee at a quarter to three, on Nathan's say so. He said these appointments could go on for some time, and that he would hold the fort until I got back. I dawdled a little in the reception area, flicking through the magazines in the newsagent's lingering over chocolate bars.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="三点差一刻的时候，在内森的建议下，我去买了杯咖啡。他说这种会面通常会持续一段时间，他会坚守阵地直到我回来。我在前台闲逛了一会儿，在报刊批发商那儿翻了翻杂志，慢腾腾地吃着巧克力棒。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It wasn't the sight of Will's uncovered body that had shocked me, slim and scarred as it was.
