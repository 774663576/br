<div class="line_en">But on occasions such as this, Mr Plomacy proved his real worth. He had the honour of the family at heart, and he appreciated the duties of hospitality for such an ancient house. Therefore he always took the arrangements for such events into his own hands, and very well he managed them, too.</div>

<div class="line_en">The day of the Ullathorne party arrived, and Miss Thorne was in great anxiety about the preparations. Mr Thorne also had a great deal to do. But the most hard-working, the most anxious and the most effective person at Ullathorne House was the steward, Mr Plomacy. In his youth he had lived through dangerous times, and had once been sent over to Paris with secret letters, hidden in his boot, for the King of France. He had been lucky enough to return safely, and since then had stayed quietly at home, but the adventure had gained him a reputation for political cleverness and complete reliability. Now he had been steward of Ullathorne for more than fifty years, and it had been a very easy life. Who could require much work from a man who had carried documents which, if discovered, would have cost him his head?</div>

<div class="line_en">A difficult question presented itself immediately. Who, exactly, was to be fed in the garden and who in the field? It was easy to see that Bishop Proudie would belong in the garden, and Farmer Greenacre, with his red face and plain country manners, in the field. But what about Mrs Lookaloft, whose husband was only a farmer, but whose daughters attended a fashionable private school, and who had a piano in her sitting room? She would not be happy talking about butter and chickens to her neighbour Mrs Greenacre, and yet she was no fit companion for the Thornes and Grantlys. People like her would certainly want to leave the field and cross the stream to join high society in the garden tent, if they could. All Miss Thorne and Mr Plomacy could do was to make their arrangements and hope for the best.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="马上就有一个难题。究竟谁该在花园里用餐，谁又该在草地上用餐呢？不用说，普劳蒂主教肯定要安排在花园里，举止一看就是乡下人的红脸膛农夫格里纳克肯定要安排在草地上。可是，卢克罗夫特太太该怎么安排才好呢？她丈夫只是一名农夫，可女儿们上的却都是时髦的私立学校，而且她的会客厅里还摆着一台钢琴。要是让她跟邻居格里纳克太太谈论黄油和小鸡，她肯定会不高兴，但她又不适合跟索恩家和格兰特利家的人作伴。只要有可能，像她这样的人自然想离开草地，到小溪那边加入花园帐篷里的上流社会。索恩小姐和普洛玛西先生只能做好安排，祈祷一切顺利。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The day had been planned as follows: the guests would gather in the house and garden; sports would be played in the field; a generous meal would be served. Two enormous tents had been set up, one in the main part of the garden, near the house, and the other in the sports field, separated from the garden by a stream. High society -- the lords, ladies, clergy, and gentlemen of the surrounding area -- would have their lunch in the garden tent, while low society -- the farmers, shopkeepers, and other ordinary working people -- would eat in the field tent.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这一天的安排是这样的：宾客们在宅子和花园里会合，体育运动安排在草地上，此外还有一顿丰盛的宴席。两顶巨大的帐篷搭起来了，一顶在花园的核心位置，靠近房子，另一顶在用来开展体育运动的草地上，跟花园隔着一条小溪。上流社会——包括周边地区的各位贵族、女士、神职人员和绅士——将在花园的帐篷里享用午餐，下层社会——包括农夫、商店店主和其他普通劳动阶层——则在草地上的帐篷里用餐。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In a sort of dream, Mr Arabin did as he was told. And as she watched him go into the garden tent, Madeline knew she had read his heart, and was amazed at his honesty. He was the first man who had not tried to court or flatter her, and whose words she felt she could trust. This endeared him to her. And as it seemed unlikely that Eleanor would agree to marry Bertie, Madeline decided to do good for once in her life, and give up Mr Arabin to the woman whom he loved. Not only that, she would do everything in her power to assist his courtship.</div>
