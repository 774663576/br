<div class="line_en">The brilliant light overhead was still blinding-bright, and yet I could plainly see the glowing strands of the filaments inside the bulb. I could see each color of the rainbow in the white light, and, at the very edge of the spectrum, an eighth color I had no name for.</div>

<div class="line_en">Behind the light, I could distinguish the individual grains in the dark wood ceiling above. In front of it, I could see the dust motes in the air, the sides the light touched, and the dark sides, distinct and separate. They spun like little planets, moving around each other in a celestial dance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在光的背后，我能分辨出在黑色木质天花板上的每一条纹路。而在它前面，我能看见空气中的尘埃，它们被清晰、独立地区别成被光照到的那一面和在黑暗中的那些。它们像小行星一样快速旋转着，绕着彼此转动着在空中翩翩起舞。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I did not need the air, but I liked it. In it, I could taste the room around me -- taste the lovely dust motes, the mix of the stagnant air mingling with the flow of slightly cooler air from the open door. Taste a lush whiff of silk. Taste a faint hint of something warm and desirable, something that should be moist, but wasn't… That smell made my throat burn dryly, a faint echo of the venom burn, though the scent was tainted by the bite of chlorine and ammonia. And most of all, I could taste an almost-honey-lilac-and-sun -- flavored scent that was the strongest thing, the closest thing to me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我不再需要空气，但我依然喜欢它。通过它，我能体会到身体周围的空间——体会到可爱的尘埃，体会到混沌的空气与从敞开的门外涌入的微冷的空气混合起来的感受。品尝到丝绸华丽舒适的气息。品尝到一些来自温暖并具有吸引力的东西的微弱的暗示，也许是湿润的，又或许不是……这股气息使我的喉咙饥渴地燃烧起来，对毒液的燃烧做出微弱的回应。虽然这股气味被一些氯气和氨水所污染了。总之，我尝到一种几乎是有着蜂蜜、丁香和阳光的味道，这便是对我来说最强有力的事情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The dust was so beautiful that I inhaled in shock; the air whistled down my throat, swirling the motes into a vortex. The action felt wrong. I considered, and realized the problem was that there was no relief tied to the action. I didn't need the air. My lungs weren't waiting for it. They reacted indifferently to the influx.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尘埃是如此的美丽，使我不由惊讶地吸了口气。空气呼啸着进入我的喉咙，将尘埃卷成一个漩涡。这个举动感觉不太对劲。我想了想，然后意识到问题在于这个举动不再意味着任何轻松。我不再需要空气。我的肺不再期待它。它们不以为然地对涌入的空气做出反应。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">My vampire family waited cautiously against the far wall by the door, Emmett and Jasper in the front. Like there was danger. My nostrils flared, searching for the threat. I could smell nothing out of place. That faint scent of something delicious -- but marred by harsh chemicals -- tickled my throat again, setting it to aching and burning.</div>
