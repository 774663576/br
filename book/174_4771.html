<div class="line_en">That, Peter had told Wendy, was the way to the Neverland; but even birds, carrying maps and consulting them at windy corners, could not have sighted it with these instructions. Peter, you see, just said anything that came into his head.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这就是彼得告诉温迪到永无乡去的路。但即使是鸟儿带着地图，在每个风角照图找，按照他指示的路线也是没法找到的。要知道，彼得不过是想到什么就信口那么一说罢了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sometimes it was dark and sometimes light, and now they were very cold and again too warm. Did they really feel hungry at times, or were they merely pretending, because Peter had such a jolly new way of feeding them? His way was to pursue birds who had food in their mouths suitable for humans and snatch it from them; then the birds would follow and snatch it back; and they would all go chasing each other gaily for miles, parting at last with mutual expressions of good-will. But Wendy noticed with gentle concern that Peter did not seem to know that this was rather an odd way of getting your bread and butter, nor even that there are other ways.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有时天很黑，有时又很亮；有时很冷，有时又太热了。也不知有时他们是真的觉得饿，还是装作饿了。因为彼得有那么一种新鲜有趣的方法给他们找食，他的办法就是追逐那些嘴里衔着人能吃的东西的飞鸟，从它们嘴里夺过吃食。于是鸟儿追了上来，又夺了回去。就这样，他们彼此开心地追来追去，一连好几里；最后，他们互相表示好意就分手了。但是，温迪温和地关切地注意到，彼得似乎不知道这种觅食的方法有多么古怪，他甚至不知道还有别种觅食的办法。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Certainly they did not pretend to be sleepy, they were sleepy; and that was a danger, for the moment they popped off, down they fell. The awful thing was that Peter thought this funny.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Save him, save him!" cried Wendy, looking with horror at the cruel sea far below. Eventually Peter would dive through the air, and catch Michael just before he could strike the sea, and it was lovely the way he did it; but he always waited till the last moment, and you felt it was his cleverness that interested him and not the saving of human life. Also he was fond of variety, and the sport that engrossed him one moment would suddenly cease to engage him, so there was always the possibility that the next time you fell he would let you go.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“救救他，救救他！”温迪大叫，望着下面那片汹涌的大海，吓坏了。末了，就在迈克尔即将掉进海里的一刹那，彼得从半空中一个俯冲下去，把迈克尔抓住。他这一手真够漂亮的。可是他总要等到最后一刻才使出这招，你觉得，他感兴趣的是卖弄他的本领，而不是救人一命。而且他喜欢变换花样，这一阵爱玩一种游戏，过一会儿又腻了。很可能下一次你再往下坠时，他就由你去了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He could sleep in the air without falling, by merely lying on his back and floating, but this was, partly at least, because he was so light that if you got behind him and blew he went faster.</div>

<div class="line_en">Indeed they were constantly bumping. They could now fly strongly, though they still kicked far too much; but if they saw a cloud in front of them, the more the tried to avoid it, the more certainly did they bump into it. If Nana had been with them, she would have had a bandage round Michael's forehead by this time.</div>

<div class="line_en">Peter was not with them for the moment, and they felt rather lonely up there by themselves. He could go so much faster than they that he would suddenly shoot out of sight, to have some adventure in which they had no share. He would come down laughing over something fearfully funny he had been saying to a star, but he had already forgotten what it was, or he would come up with mermaid scales still sticking to him, and yet not be able to say for certain what had been happening. It was really rather irritating to children who had never seen a mermaid.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="彼得这会儿没和他们飞在一起，他们在空中觉得怪寂寞的。他飞得比他们快多了，所以，他可以突然蹿到别处不见了，去寻点什么乐子，那是他们没份的。他会大笑着飞下来，笑的是他和一颗星星说过的逗得要命的笑话．可是他已经忘记了那是什么。有时他又飞上来，身上还沾着人鱼的鳞片，可究竟发生了什么，他又说不上来。从没见过人鱼的孩子们，实在有点恼火。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Indeed, sometimes when he returned he did not remember them, at least not well. Wendy was sure of it. She saw recognition come into his eyes as he was about to pass them the time of day of go on; once even she had to call him by name.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="真的，有时他回来时就不认得他们，至少是认不清了。温迪知道准是这样的，白天他正打他们身边飞过，就要飞走的时候，温迪看见，他眼里露出认出来的神情。有一次，她甚至不得不告诉他自己的名字。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Of course this was rather unsatisfactory. However, to make amends he showed them how to lie out flat on a strong wind that was going their way, and this was such a pleasant change that they tried it several times and found that could sleep thus with security. Indeed they would have slept longer, but Peter tired quickly of sleeping, and soon he would cry in his captain voice, "We get off here." So with occasional tiffs, but on the whole rollicking, they drew near the Neverland; for after many moons they did reach it, and, what is more, they had been going pretty straight all the time, not perhaps so much owing to the guidance of Peter or Tink as because the island was looking for them. It is only thus that any one may sight those magic shores.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当然，这是不怎么令人满意的。不过，为了弥补，他教他们怎样平躺在一股顺方向的狂风上。这个变化真叫人高兴，他们试了几次，就能稳稳当当地这样睡觉了。他们本想多睡一会儿，可是彼得很快就睡腻了，他马上就用队长的口气喊道：“我们要在这儿下来了。”就这样，一路上尽管不免有小争小吵，可总的来说是欢快的，他们终于飞近永无乡了。因为，过了好几个月，他们真的飞到了；而且，他们一直是照直朝它飞去的，这倒不完全是因为有彼得和叮叮铃带路，而是因为那些岛正在眺望他们。只有这样，一个人才能看见那些神奇的岸。">查看中文翻译</div>
