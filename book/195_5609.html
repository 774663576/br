<div class="line_en">He had arranged to meet Sally on Saturday in the National Gallery. She was to come there as soon as she was released from the shop and had agreed to lunch with him. Two days had passed since he had seen her, and his exultation had not left him for a moment. It was because he rejoiced in the feeling that he had not attempted to see her. He had repeated to himself exactly what he would say to her and how he should say it. Now his impatience was unbearable. He had written to Doctor South and had in his pocket a telegram from him received that morning: "Sacking the mumpish fool. When will you come?" Philip walked along Parliament Street. It was a fine day, and there was a bright, frosty sun which made the light dance in the street. It was crowded. There was a tenuous mist in the distance, and it softened exquisitely the noble lines of the buildings. He crossed Trafalgar Square. Suddenly his heart gave a sort of twist in his body; he saw a woman in front of him who he thought was Mildred. She had the same figure, and she walked with that slight dragging of the feet which was so characteristic of her. Without thinking, but with a beating heart, he hurried till he came alongside, and then, when the woman turned, he saw it was someone unknown to him. It was the face of a much older person, with a lined, yellow skin. He slackened his pace. He was infinitely relieved, but it was not only relief that he felt; it was disappointment too; he was seized with horror of himself. Would he never be free from that passion? At the bottom of his heart, notwithstanding everything, he felt that a strange, desperate thirst for that vile woman would always linger. That love had caused him so much suffering that he knew he would never, never quite be free of it. Only death could finally assuage his desire.</div>

<div class="line_en">But he wrenched the pang from his heart. He thought of Sally, with her kind blue eyes; and his lips unconsciously formed themselves into a smile. He walked up the steps of the National Gallery and sat down in the first room, so that he should see her the moment she came in. It always comforted him to get among pictures. He looked at none in particular, but allowed the magnificence of their colour, the beauty of their lines, to work upon his soul. His imagination was busy with Sally. It would be pleasant to take her away from that London in which she seemed an unusual figure, like a cornflower in a shop among orchids and azaleas; he had learned in the Kentish hop-field that she did not belong to the town; and he was sure that she would blossom under the soft skies of Dorset to a rarer beauty. She came in, and he got up to meet her. She was in black, with white cuffs at her wrists and a lawn collar round her neck. They shook hands.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他想到萨莉，那双温柔的蓝眼睛，胸中的痛苦就这样云淡风轻。他的唇角无意识地慢慢上扬，勾起一抹微笑。他来到美术馆门口，拾阶而上，在第一间展厅坐了下来，这样等萨莉一进门他就能看到。每每置身于绘画他便觉得心旷神怡。他没有刻意盯着哪一幅，只是四下扫视，放任心灵尽情濡染这瑰丽的色彩和精致的线条。他脑子里想的全都是萨莉。他想带她离开伦敦。和店里的其他女孩站在一起，萨莉就像一棵长在兰花、杜鹃丛里的矢车菊。在肯特郡的啤酒花田干活的那段日子让他知道她不是一个归属于城市的女孩。他确信，只有多塞特的习习微风才能催开这朵儿明艳动人的花。萨莉终于来了，菲利普起身迎接，向她招手。她穿着黑裙，袖口翻上两道白边儿，领子上缝了一圈细麻布。他们握了握手。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They sat quietly, side by side, without speaking. Philip enjoyed having her near him. He was warmed by her radiant health. A glow of life seemed like an aureole to shine about her.</div>

<div class="line_en">An extraordinary sensation filled him. He had felt certain that Sally's suspicion was well-founded; it had never occurred to him for an instant that there was a possibility of error. All his plans were suddenly overthrown, and the existence, so elaborately pictured, was no more than a dream which would never be realised. He was free once more. Free! He need give up none of his projects, and life still was in his hands for him to do what he liked with. He felt no exhilaration, but only dismay. His heart sank. The future stretched out before him in desolate emptiness. It was as though he had sailed for many years over a great waste of waters, with peril and privation, and at last had come upon a fair haven, but as he was about to enter, some contrary wind had arisen and drove him out again into the open sea; and because he had let his mind dwell on these soft meads and pleasant woods of the land, the vast deserts of the ocean filled him with anguish. He could not confront again the loneliness and the tempest. Sally looked at him with her clear eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="菲利普也搞不清现在心里是种什么滋味。他之前对萨莉的猜测没有丁点怀疑，从没想过这可能只是她搞错了。他规划好的人生模型瞬间分崩离析，那精心设计的生活不过是一场幻梦，可能永远也得不到实现。他又一次自由了。自由啊！他无须放弃最初的计划，因为生活还是稳稳地攥在手里，随他想去做些什么。可他非但没觉得高兴，反而有些淡淡的忧伤。他的一颗心渐渐垂了下去。眼前的未来空空旷旷，冷冷凄凄。他像一个绝望的水手，在浩瀚无边的大洋上漂流多年，经历了风雨险滩，忍受了饥寒交迫，终于觅得一片平静的港口。但他正要驶入时，却刮来一阵疾风把他再一次吹进浩淼的大海。他一门心思地惦记着陆上草坪柔软、树丛茂密，而那动荡苍茫的大海却只让他苦不堪言。他不能再做一个孤零零的漂泊者了。萨莉用清澈的眼睛看着他，又问了一次：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He realised that he had deceived himself; it was no self-sacrifice that had driven him to think of marrying, but the desire for a wife and a home and love; and now that it all seemed to slip through his fingers he was seized with despair. He wanted all that more than anything in the world. What did he care for Spain and its cities, Cordova, Toledo, Leon; what to him were the pagodas of Burmah and the lagoons of South Sea Islands? America was here and now. It seemed to him that all his life he had followed the ideals that other people, by their words or their writings, had instilled into him, and never the desires of his own heart. Always his course had been swayed by what he thought he should do and never by what he wanted with his whole soul to do. He put all that aside now with a gesture of impatience. He had lived always in the future, and the present always, always had slipped through his fingers. His ideals? He thought of his desire to make a design, intricate and beautiful, out of the myriad, meaningless facts of life: had he not seen also that the simplest pattern, that in which a man was born, worked, married, had children, and died, was likewise the most perfect? It might be that to surrender to happiness was to accept defeat, but it was a defeat better than many victories.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他发现原来自己一直都在自欺，驱使他和萨莉结婚的念头绝不是自我牺牲，他只是想要一个妻子、一个家庭，只是想得到一份爱情罢了。可现在，这一切都将悄然从指尖溜走，他不禁陷入了深深的绝望。他对这一切的渴望超过了世上的所有。西班牙算得了什么？哥多华、托莱多、利昂算得了什么？缅甸的佛塔、南海岛屿的湖泊又算得了什么？此时此地，他坐在国家美术馆，但这和行走在陌生的美洲大陆又有什么区别？过去，其他的人一直通过语言或文字向他灌输理想的定义，他则紧随其后，亦步亦趋，未曾有过一次随心所欲。他只做应该做的，从不随性而为。可现在，他急不可耐地把这些都抛在身后。每个“昨日”都在为“明日”做打算，而“今日”就这样白白付诸东流。他的理想是什么？他曾经想看透这生活的复杂与无为，勾勒一幅精密绝伦、美不胜收的人生图案。可他从没发现也许由出生、工作、婚姻、生育、死亡编织出的最简单的形状才是最完美的模样。可能向幸福投降就是承认了生命的失败，可这样的失败却比任何勋章都更加闪亮。">查看中文翻译</div>
