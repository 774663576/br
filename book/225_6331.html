<div class="line_en">Madame Defarge, with her arms folded, sat in the morning light and heat, contemplating the wine-shop and the street. In both, there were several knots of loungers, squalid and miserable, but now with a manifest sense of power enthroned on their distress. The raggedest nightcap, awry on the wretchedest head, had this crooked significance in it: "I know how hard it has grown for me, the wearer of this, to support life in myself; but do you know how easy it has grown for me, the wearer of this, to destroy life in you?" Every lean bare arm, that had been without work before, had this work always ready for it now, that it could strike. The fingers of the knitting women were vicious, with the experience that they could tear. There was a change in the appearance of Saint Antoine; the image had been hammering into this for hundreds of years, and the last finishing blows had told mightily on the expression.</div>

<div class="line_en">Haggard Saint Antoine had had only one exultant week, in which to soften his modicum of hard and bitter bread to such extent as he could, with the relish of fraternal embraces and congratulations, when Madame Defarge sat at her counter, as usual, presiding over the customers. Madame Defarge wore no rose in her head, for the great brotherhood of Spies had become, even in one short week, extremely chary of trusting themselves to the saint's mercies. The lamps across his streets had a portentously elastic swing with them.</div>

<div class="line_en">The men were terrible, in the bloody-minded anger with which they looked from windows, caught up what arms they had, and came pouring down into the streets; but, the women were a sight to chill the boldest. From such household occupations as their bare poverty yielded, from their children, from their aged and their sick crouching on the bare ground famished and naked, they ran out with streaming hair, urging one another, and themselves, to madness with the wildest cries and actions. Villain Foulon taken, my sister! Old Foulon taken, my mother! Miscreant Foulon taken, my daughter! Then, a score of others ran into the midst of these, beating their breasts, tearing their hair, and screaming, Foulon alive! Foulon who told the starving people they might eat grass! Foulon who told my old father that he might eat grass, when I had no bread to give him! Foulon who told my baby it might suck grass, when these breasts were dry with want! O mother of God, this Foulon! O Heaven our suffering! Hear me, my dead baby and my withered father: I swear on my knees, on these stones, to avenge you on Foulon! Husbands, and brothers, and young men, Give us the blood of Foulon, Give us the head of Foulon, Give us the heart of Foulon, Give us the body and soul of Foulon, Rend Foulon to pieces, and dig him into the ground, that grass may grow from him! With these cries, numbers of the women, lashed into blind frenzy, whirled about, striking and tearing at their own friends until they dropped into a passionate swoon, and were only saved by the men belonging to them from being trampled under foot.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="男人们很可怕，他们怀着要想流血的愤怒，从窗口上瞧了一下便抓起自己所能到手的武器，潮水一样上了街。妇女们的样子能让最勇敢的人也心里发冷。她们丢开了赤贫生活带来的家务，丢开了孩子，丢开了趴在光秃秃的地板上的饥饿、赤裸的老人和病人，披头散发地跑了出来，此呼彼应，以最野性的呼喊和行为投入了疯狂的活动“姐姐，坏蛋富伦给抓住了！”“妈妈，恶棍富伦给抓住了！”“女儿呀，无赖富伦给抓住了！”然后，又有二十来个妇女加入了她们的行列。她们敲着胸脯，扯着头发，尖声地叫道，“富伦还活着。”“富伦，三家伙告诉饿肚子的人说他们可以吃草。”“富伦，在我没有面包给我爸爸吃的时候，那家伙却说他可以吃草。”“富伦，我这奶里因为穷，没有了奶水，他却说我的娃娃可以吃草。”“啊，圣母呀，这个富伦。”“啊，天呐，我们的苦难呀。”“听着，我死去的孩子和我病弱的爸爸：我跪在地上，跪在石头上起誓，我要为你们向富伦报仇！丈夫们，弟兄们，小伙子们，给我们富伦的血。”“给我们富伦的头，给我们富伦的心。”“给我们富伦的身子和灵魂。”“把富伦碎尸万段，埋到泥土里去，让青草从他身上长出来！”这样叫着，许多妇女便发起狂来，忘记了一切，打着旋儿，跟朋友们殴打撕扯，直闹得晕了过去，全靠家里的男人救助，才没有被人踩在脚下。">查看中文翻译</div>

Never, if Saint Antoine knew his own sufferings, insults, and wrongs! Armed men and women flocked out of the Quarter so fast, and drew even these last dregs after them with such a force of suction, that within a quarter of an hour there was not a human creature in Saint Antoine's bosom but a few old crones and the wailing children.</div>

<div class="line_en">The people immediately behind Madame Defarge, explaining the cause of her satisfaction to those behind them, and those again explaining to others, and those to others, the neighbouring streets resounded with the clapping of hands. Similarly, during two or three hours of drawl, and the winnowing of many bushels of words, Madame Defarge's frequent expressions of impatience were taken up, with marvellous quickness, at a distance: the more readily, because certain men who had by some wonderful exercise of agility climbed up the external architecture to look in from the windows, knew Madame Defarge well, and acted as a telegraph between her and the crowd outside the building.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="德伐日太太背后的人把她满意的理由告诉了自己背后的人，他们背后的人又向别人解释，别人又再向别人解释，于是附近的街道便也响起了掌声。同样，在两三个钟头的吵闹中筛了不知道几大箩的话里，德伐日太太常有些不耐烦的意见曾以惊人的速度在远处得到响应，因为有几个身手矫捷得惊人的人爬到了建筑物外面，从窗上往里瞧。他们很熟悉德伐日太太，便充当了她跟外面的人群之间的活电报。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was known directly, to the furthest confines of the crowd. Defarge had but sprung over a railing and a table, and folded the miserable wretch in a deadly embrace -- Madame Defarge had but followed and turned her hand in one of the ropes with which he was tied -- The Vengeance and Jacques Three were not yet up with them, and the men at the windows had not yet swooped into the Hall, like birds of prey from their high perches -- when the cry seemed to go up, all over the city, "Bring him out!

Once, he went aloft, and the rope broke, and they caught him shrieking; twice, he went aloft, and the rope broke, and they caught him shrieking; then, the rope was merciful, and held him, and his head was soon upon a pike, with grass enough in the mouth for all Saint Antoine to dance at the sight of.</div>

<div class="line_en">Not before dark night did the men and women come back to the children, wailing and breadless. Then, the miserable bakers' shops were beset by long files of them, patiently waiting to buy bad bread; and while they waited with stomachs faint and empty, they beguiled the time by embracing one another on the triumphs of the day, and achieving them again in gossip. Gradually, these strings of ragged people shortened and frayed away; and then poor lights began to shine in high windows, and slender fires were made in the streets, at which neighbours cooked in common, afterwards supping at their doors.</div>

Saint Antoine wrote his crimes on flaring sheets of paper, seized him -- would have torn him out of the breast of an army to bear Foulon company -- set his head and heart on pikes, and carried the three spoils of the day, in Wolf-procession through the streets.</div>
