<div class="line_en">Mrs. Elton was first seen at church: but though devotion might be interrupted, curiosity could not be satisfied by a bride in a pew, and it must be left for the visits in form which were then to be paid, to settle whether she were very pretty indeed, or only rather pretty, or not pretty at all.</div>

<div class="line_en">Emma had feelings, less of curiosity than of pride or propriety, to make her resolve on not being the last to pay her respects; and she made a point of Harriet's going with her, that the worst of the business might be gone through as soon as possible.</div>

<div class="line_en">She could not enter the house again, could not be in the same room to which she had with such vain artifice retreated three months ago, to lace up her boot, without recollecting. A thousand vexatious thoughts would recur. Compliments, charades, and horrible blunders; and it was not to be supposed that poor Harriet should not be recollecting too; but she behaved very well, and was only rather pale and silent. The visit was of course short; and there was so much embarrassment and occupation of mind to shorten it, that Emma would not allow herself entirely to form an opinion of the lady, and on no account to give one, beyond the nothing-meaning terms of being "elegantly dressed, and very pleasing."</div>

<div class="line_en">As for Mr. Elton, his manners did not appear-but no, she would not permit a hasty or a witty word from herself about his manners. It was an awkward ceremony at any time to be receiving wedding visits, and a man had need be all grace to acquit himself well through it. The woman was better off; she might have the assistance of fine clothes, and the privilege of bashfulness, but the man had only his own good sense to depend on; and when she considered how peculiarly unlucky poor Mr. Elton was in being in the same room at once with the woman he had just married, the woman he had wanted to marry, and the woman whom he had been expected to marry, she must allow him to have the right to look as little wise, and to be as much affectedly, and as little really easy as could be.</div>

<div class="line_en">She did not really like her. She would not be in a hurry to find fault, but she suspected that there was no elegance; -- ease, but not elegance. -- She was almost sure that for a young woman, a stranger, a bride, there was too much ease. Her person was rather good; her face not unpretty; but neither feature, nor air, nor voice, nor manner, were elegant. Emma thought at least it would turn out so.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱玛并非真正喜欢她。她不想急于挑毛病，但是觉得她并不文雅：大方而不文雅。她几乎可以肯定，她作为一个年轻女人，一个陌生人，一个新娘，有些过于大方了。她的模样相当不错，脸蛋也不能算不漂亮，但是她的五官、神态、嗓音、举止都不优雅。爱玛心想，至少以后会显现出来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When the visit was returned, Emma made up her mind. She could then see more and judge better. From Harriet's happening not to be at Hartfield, and her father's being present to engage Mr. Elton, she had a quarter of an hour of the lady's conversation to herself, and could composedly attend to her; and the quarter of an hour quite convinced her that Mrs. Elton was a vain woman, extremely well satisfied with herself, and thinking much of her own importance; that she meant to shine and be very superior, but with manners which had been formed in a bad school, pert and familiar; that all her notions were drawn from one set of people, and one style of living; that if not foolish she was ignorant, and that her society would certainly do Mr. Elton no good.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="新婚夫妇回访以后，爱玛就打定了主意。这时候，她可以看得仔细些，作出比较公正的判断。哈丽特碰巧不在哈特菲尔德，伍德豪斯先生要应酬埃尔顿先生，她便独自跟那位太太聊了一刻钟，可以安安静静地听她说话。经过这一刻钟的交谈，她深深地认识到：埃尔顿太太是个爱慕虚荣的人，沾沾自喜，自以为了不起；就想炫耀自己，出人头地，可惜她是在一所蹩脚的学校受的教育，举止又冒失又随便；她的见识都自于同一类人、同一种生活方式；即使算不上愚蠢，也可以说是愚昧无知；埃尔顿先生跟她朝夕相处，肯定没有什么好处。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harriet would have been a better match. If not wise or refined herself, she would have connected him with those who were; but Miss Hawkins, it might be fairly supposed from her easy conceit, had been the best of her own set. The rich brother-in-law near Bristol was the pride of the alliance, and his place and his carriages were the pride of him.</div>

<div class="line_en">"And the staircase-You know, as I came in, I observed how very like the staircase was; placed exactly in the same part of the house. I really could not help exclaiming! I assure you, Miss Woodhouse, it is very delightful to me, to be reminded of a place I am so extremely partial to as Maple Grove. I have spent so many happy months there! (with a little sigh of sentiment). A charming place, undoubtedly. Every body who sees it is struck by its beauty; but to me, it has been quite a home. Whenever you are transplanted, like me, Miss Woodhouse, you will understand how very delightful it is to meet with any thing at all like what one has left behind. I always say this is quite one of the evils of matrimony."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“还有这楼梯呢——你知道，我一进来就发现这楼梯多么相像，放在房里的同一位置。我简直忍不住要感叹啊！说真的，伍德豪斯小姐，在这儿能让我想起枫园这样一个我最最喜爱的地方，我觉得真是高兴。我在那儿愉愉快快地度过了多少个月呀！”说着动情地轻轻叹了口气。“毫无疑问，是个迷人的地方。谁见了都觉得美，可是对我来说，那儿可是我的家呀。伍德豪斯小姐，你要是什么时候像我这样离开了家，看到什么东西跟你撇下的东西有些相似，你会觉得有多高兴啊。我总说这是结婚的一个弊端。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The very first subject after being seated was Maple Grove, "My brother Mr. Suckling's seat;" -- a comparison of Hartfield to Maple Grove. The grounds of Hartfield were small, but neat and pretty; and the house was modern and well-built. Mrs. Elton seemed most favourably impressed by the size of the room, the entrance, and all that she could see or imagine. "Very like Maple Grove indeed! -- She was quite struck by the likeness! -- That room was the very shape and size of the morning-room at Maple Grove; her sister's favourite room." -- Mr. Elton was appealed to. --"Was not it astonishingly like? -- She could really almost fancy herself at Maple Grove."</div>

The laurels at Maple Grove are in the same profusion as here, and stand very much in the same way-just across the lawn; and I had a glimpse of a fine large tree, with a bench round it, which put me so exactly in mind!

<div class="line_en">"My brother and sister have promised us a visit in the spring, or summer at farthest," continued Mrs. Elton; "and that will be our time for exploring. While they are with us, we shall explore a great deal, I dare say. They will have their barouche-landau, of course, which holds four perfectly; and therefore, without saying any thing of our carriage, we should be able to explore the different beauties extremely well. They would hardly come in their chaise, I think, at that season of the year. Indeed, when the time draws on, I shall decidedly recommend their bringing the barouche-landau; it will be so very much preferable. When people come into a beautiful country of this sort, you know, Miss Woodhouse, one naturally wishes them to see as much as possible; and Mr. Suckling is extremely fond of exploring. We explored to King's-Weston twice last summer, in that way, most delightfully, just after their first having the barouche-landau. You have many parties of that kind here, I suppose, Miss Woodhouse, every summer?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"Ah! there is nothing like staying at home for real comfort. Nobody can be more devoted to home than I am. I was quite a proverb for it at Maple Grove. Many a time has Selina said, when she has been going to Bristol, `I really cannot get this girl to move from the house. I absolutely must go in by myself, though I hate being stuck up in the barouche-landau without a companion; but Augusta, I believe, with her own good-will, would never stir beyond the park paling.' Many a time has she said so; and yet I am no advocate for entire seclusion. I think, on the contrary, when people shut themselves up entirely from society, it is a very bad thing; and that it is much more advisable to mix in the world in a proper degree, without living in it either too much or too little. I perfectly understand your situation, however, Miss Woodhouse -- (looking towards Mr. Woodhouse), Your father's state of health must be a great drawback. Why does not he try Bath? -- Indeed he should. Let me recommend Bath to you. I assure you I have no doubt of its doing Mr. Woodhouse good."</div>

And as to its recommendations to you, I fancy I need not take much pains to dwell on them. The advantages of Bath to the young are pretty generally understood. It would be a charming introduction for you, who have lived so secluded a life; and I could immediately secure you some of the best society in the place. A line from me would bring you a little host of acquaintance; and my particular friend, Mrs. Partridge, the lady I have always resided with when in Bath, would be most happy to shew you any attentions, and would be the very person for you to go into public with."</div>

You, Miss Woodhouse, I well know, play delightfully. I assure you it has been the greatest satisfaction, comfort, and delight to me, to hear what a musical society I am got into. I absolutely cannot do without music. It is a necessary of life to me; and having always been used to a very musical society, both at Maple Grove and in Bath, it would have been a most serious sacrifice. I honestly said as much to Mr. E. when he was speaking of my future home, and expressing his fears lest the retirement of it should be disagreeable; and the inferiority of the house too-knowing what I had been accustomed to-of course he was not wholly without apprehension.

I think, Miss Woodhouse, you and I must establish a musical club, and have regular weekly meetings at your house, or ours. Will not it be a good plan? If we exert ourselves, I think we shall not be long in want of allies. Something of that nature would be particularly desirable for me, as an inducement to keep me in practice; for married women, you know -- there is a sad story against them, in general. They are but too apt to give up music."</div>

Upon my word it is enough to put one in a fright. I used to be quite angry with Selina; but really I begin now to comprehend that a married woman has many things to call her attention.

I made the best excuses I could for not having been able to wait on him and Mrs. Elton on this happy occasion; I said that I hoped I should in the course of the summer.
