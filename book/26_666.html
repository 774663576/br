<div class="line_en">But she was a magnificent monument to the blessing of a want of imagination, and if she could see in our little charges nothing but their beauty and amiability, their happiness and cleverness, she had no direct communication with the sources of my trouble.</div>

<div class="line_en">I drew a great security in this particular from her mere smooth aspect. There was nothing in her fresh face to pass on to others my horrible confidences. She believed me, I was sure, absolutely: if she hadn't I don't know what would have become of me, for I couldn't have borne the business alone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="仅仅从她平静的神态中，我感到了强烈的安全感。她光鲜的脸不会向其他人传达出我那可怕的自信。我非常确信，她信任我，如果不是的话，我不知道我会变成什么样，因为我无法独自承担这件事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was not till late next day that I spoke to Mrs. Grose; the rigor with which I kept my pupils in sight making it often difficult to meet her privately, and the more as we each felt the importance of not provoking -- on the part of the servants quite as much as on that of the children -- any suspicion of a secret flurry or that of a discussion of mysteries.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="直到第二天晚上，我才和格罗斯太太谈及此事。由于我总是把学生们看得很紧，这使得和格罗斯太太私下见面变得困难。我们越来越感到不能为此事大动干戈——这既是站在仆人的角度，也是站在孩子们的角度上考虑的——对于秘密的任何惊恐的猜想或讨论都无济于事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">If they had been at all visibly blighted or battered, she would doubtless have grown, on tracing it back, haggard enough to match them; as matters stood, however, I could feel her, when she surveyed them, with her large white arms folded and the habit of serenity in all her look, thank the Lord's mercy that if they were ruined the pieces would still serve.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果两个孩子都被明显地受到摧残或折磨，格罗斯太太会毫无疑问地弄清原因，而且会和他们一样面容憔悴。然而，就目前的情况来看，我可以感觉到，当她审视他们时，将她雪白粗胖的胳膊叠放在一起，习惯性地面带平静。老天开恩，如果他们被摧毁，残片仍旧有用。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At the hour I now speak of she had joined me, under pressure, on the terrace, where, with the lapse of the season, the afternoon sun was now agreeable; and we sat there together while, before us, at a distance, but within call if we wished, the children strolled to and fro in one of their most manageable moods.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我提到过，格罗斯太太是在巨大的压力下加入到我的行列的，那时是在露台上，时光流逝，午后的阳光懒洋洋地照在我们身上，我们并肩坐在梯田上，孩子们正在前面不远处开心地四处漫步，一喊他们就能听到。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Flights of fancy gave place, in her mind, to a steady fireside glow, and I had already begun to perceive how, with the development of the conviction that -- as time went on without a public accident -- our young things could, after all, look out for themselves, she addressed her greatest solicitude to the sad case presented by their instructress. That, for myself, was a sound simplification: I could engage that, to the world, my face should tell no tales, but it would have been, in the conditions, an immense added strain to find myself anxious about hers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在她的头脑中，纷飞的幻想已经让位给旁边徐徐燃烧的炉火。我已经开始觉察到，随着这个信念的加深——时光流逝，并没有发生一件突发公共事件——两个孩子是如何自己照顾自己的。格罗斯太太也将她极大的关心投入到他们的女家庭教师所提出的不幸事件中去。对我来说，那可以有效地减轻我的负担：我可以对全世界说我没有说谎。但有时，我还是极度紧张地发现，自己对格罗斯太太的看法感到焦虑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They moved slowly, in unison, below us, over the lawn, the boy, as they went, reading aloud from a storybook and passing his arm round his sister to keep her quite in touch.</div>

<div class="line_en">I had made her a receptacle of lurid things, but there was an odd recognition of my superiority -- my accomplishments and my function -- in her patience under my pain. She offered her mind to my disclosures as, had I wished to mix a witch's broth and proposed it with assurance, she would have held out a large clean saucepan.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她成为我倾诉恐怖事件的对象，但我的优秀却得到了奇特的认可——我所取得的成就和我的作用——她的耐心地倾听我的痛苦。她全力帮我揭开整个事件，比如说，如果我想煮一锅巫婆肉汤，并向她明确提出来，那么她一定会拿出一口干净的大锅。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This had become thoroughly her attitude by the time that, in my recital of the events of the night, I reached the point of what Miles had said to me when, after seeing him, at such a monstrous hour, almost on the very spot where he happened now to be, I had gone down to bring him in; choosing then, at the window, with a concentrated need of not alarming the house, rather that method than a signal more resonant. I had left her meanwhile in little doubt of my small hope of representing with success even to her actual sympathy my sense of the real splendor of the little inspiration with which, after I had got him into the house, the boy met my final articulate challenge.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当我给她复述那个可怕的夜晚所发生的事时，格罗斯太太变得完全支持我。我讲到当我看见是迈尔斯时，在那个可怕的时刻，他站在正好是他现在所站的地方，我那时下去带迈尔斯进来，为了不吵醒房内其他的人和引起更多的混乱，我决定和迈尔斯停在窗户旁，而不是大声地发出信号。在那里，迈尔斯对我说了一些话。同时，我还让她对我成功抓住灵感，制造奇迹的小小愿望感到怀疑和同情，正是这灵感让我在将迈尔斯带进屋后，对他进行了最后的询问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mrs. Grose watched them with positive placidity; then I caught the suppressed intellectual creak with which she conscientiously turned to take from me a view of the back of the tapestry.</div>

<div class="line_en">As soon as I appeared in the moonlight on the terrace, he had come to me as straight as possible; on which I had taken his hand without a word and led him, through the dark spaces, up the staircase where Quint had so hungrily hovered for him, along the lobby where I had listened and trembled, and so to his forsaken room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我一出现在月光下的露台上，迈尔斯就径直向我走来。我没说一句话，拉起他的手，领着他在黑暗中走上楼梯，昆特在这段楼梯上曾发疯的寻找过迈尔斯。我们穿过大厅（我曾在此听到过可怕的声响，并颤抖过），来到了他那间孤独的卧室。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I remember in fact that as we pushed into his little chamber, where the bed had not been slept in at all and the window, uncovered to the moonlight, made the place so clear that there was no need of striking a match -- I remember how I suddenly dropped, sank upon the edge of the bed from the force of the idea that he must know how he really, as they say, "had" me. He could do what he liked, with all his cleverness to help him, so long as I should continue to defer to the old tradition of the criminality of those caretakers of the young who minister to superstitions and fears. He "had" me indeed, and in a cleft stick; for who would ever absolve me, who would consent that I should go unhung, if, by the faintest tremor of an overture, I were the first to introduce into our perfect intercourse an element so dire? No, no: it was useless to attempt to convey to Mrs. Grose, just as it is scarcely less so to attempt to suggest here, how, in our short, stiff brush in the dark, he fairly shook me with admiration.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我记得，实际上，当我们推门进入他的小卧室时，床铺根本没有睡过的痕迹，窗户朝着月亮打开着，这使得房间非常亮，根本不用划火柴。我记得当时如何一屁股坐在了床边，因为我被一个念头攫住，那就是他一定知道怎样——如他们所说——“控制”我。他的聪明可以帮他做任何喜欢的事，只要我继续遵从看护小孩的古老传统，那么看护者的任务就是照看迷信和恐惧。他的确“控制”了我，让我进退两难。如果因为起初微弱的震颤，我就成为第一个把可怕因素带入我和迈尔斯和谐关系中的人，那么谁将赦免我，同意不追究我？不，不，尝试将此事传达给格罗斯太太也无济于事，就如同现在，在这短促、凝重的黑夜中，我无法告诉他他如何震撼了我，让我钦佩不已。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Not a sound, on the way, had passed between us, and I had wondered -- oh, HOW I had wondered! -- If he were groping about in his little mind for something plausible and not too grotesque.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在途中我们没说一句话，我很想知道——哦，我太想知道了！——他的小脑袋里是否正在思考着似是而非又不太离奇的东西。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It would tax his invention, certainly, and I felt, this time, over his real embarrassment, a curious thrill of triumph.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这会激发他的创造性，当然，我觉得他这次除了尴尬外，更多的是一种奇怪的胜利的喜悦。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was a sharp trap for the inscrutable! He couldn't play any longer at innocence; so how the deuce would he get out of it? There beat in me indeed, with the passionate throb of this question an equal dumb appeal as to how the deuce I should.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是一个深不可测的、狡诈的陷阱！他不再故作单纯，那么他到底是怎样出来的呢？我真的被这个问题难住了，内心汹涌澎湃地思索着，同时，我又想如果是我的话，我究竟应该如何走出来呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I was confronted at last, as never yet, with all the risk attached even now to sounding my own horrid note.</div>

<div class="line_en">I was of course thoroughly kind and merciful; never, never yet had I placed on his little shoulders hands of such tenderness as those with which, while I rested against the bed, I held him there well under fire. I had no alternative but, in form at least, to put it to him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当然，我始终都很亲和、仁慈，但我从未如此温柔地将我的双手放在他稚嫩的双肩上。在他的床边休息时，我用那双温柔的手握着他的肩，将他摆到受质询的位置上。我没有别的办法，但至少在形式上跟他说明白。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I can still see his wonderful smile, the whites of his beautiful eyes, and the uncovering of his little teeth shine to me in the dusk.</div>

<div class="line_en">"If I tell you why, will you understand?" My heart, at this, leaped into my mouth. WOULD he tell me why? I found no sound on my lips to press it, and I was aware of replying only with a vague, repeated, grimacing nod. He was gentleness itself, and while I wagged my head at him he stood there more than ever a little fairy prince.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“如果我告诉你原因，你能理解吗？”听到这里，我的心都提到嗓子眼儿了。他会告诉我为什么吗？我的双唇硬是没发出声音，我只意识到自己用含糊、重复而又愁闷的点头作了回答。他本身很有风度，当我向他点头时，他站在那里，比以前任何时候都要像一个小精灵王子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I met his kiss and I had to make, while I folded him for a minute in my arms, the most stupendous effort not to cry. He had given exactly the account of himself that permitted least of my going behind it, and it was only with the effect of confirming my acceptance of it that, as I presently glanced about the room, I could say -- "Then you didn't undress at all?" he fairly glittered in the gloom.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我接受了他的吻，在我怀抱着他的那个时刻，我用极大的努力不让自己哭出来。他明确地给出了他的解释，杜绝了我进一步探究的可能。为了让自己信服地接受这个事实，我环顾了一下房间，说道：“那么你根本就没有脱衣睡觉？”他的眼睛在黑暗中闪烁。">查看中文翻译</div>
