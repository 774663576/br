But Mrs Sucksby had been there too, she had moved as quick as anyone; and sometimes I thought it was her hand I remembered seeing dart and flash… At last I told the simple truth: that I did not know what I had seen. It didn't matter, anyway. They had John Vroom's word, and Mrs Sucksby's own confession. They didn't need me. On the fourth day after they took us, they let me go. The others they kept longer.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mr Ibbs was brought before the magistrate first. His trial lasted half-an-hour. He was done, after all, not on account of the poke left lying about the kitchen -- he was too good at taking the seals and stampings off, for that -- but for the sake of some of the notes in his cigarette box. They were marked ones. The police, it turned out, had been watching the business at Mr Ibbs's shop, for more than a month; and in the end they had got Phil -- who, you might remember, had sworn he'd never do another term in gaol, at any cost -- to plant the marked notes on him. Mr Ibbs was found to have handled stolen goods: he was sent to Pentonville. Of course, he knew many of the men in there, and might be supposed to have had an easy time among them -- except that, here was a funny thing: the fingersmiths and cracksmen who had been so grateful to get an extra shilling from him on the outside, now quite turned against him; and I think his time was very miserable. I went to visit him, a week after he went in. He saw me, and put his hands before his face, and was in general so changed and so brought down, and looked at me so queerly, I could not bear it. I didn't go again. His sister, poor thing, was found by the police in her bed at Lant Street, while they were going through the house. We had all forgotten her. She was put on the ward of a parish hospital. The move, however, was too great a shock for her; and she died.</div>

<div class="line_en">John Vroom could not be pinned to any crime, save -- through his coat -- to that old one of dog-stealing. He was let off with six nights in Tothill Fields, and a flogging. They say he was so disliked in his gaol, the keepers played cards for who should be the one to flog him; that they flung in one or two extras above his twelve, for fun; and that after, he cried like a baby. Dainty met him at the prison gate, and he punched her and blacked her eye. It was thanks to him, though, that she had got clean off from Lant Street.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="什么罪名都安不到约翰。瓦儒身上，除了一样——由他的外套引出来的——那桩偷狗的旧案。在Tothill Fields待了六个晚上，他就被放出来了，还吃了一顿鞭子。他们说他在牢房里特别不受待见，看守们用猜牌的办法来选定行刑抽他的人；抽完规定的十二下之后，他们又多抽了一两下，就为了找乐子；鞭子抽完了，他嚎得象个毛孩子。达蒂在监狱门口等他，他给了她一拳，把她的眼睛都打青了。尽管如此，还是多亏了他，她才能从蓝特街脱身。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I never spoke to him again. He took a room for him and Dainty in another house, and kept out of my way. I saw him, only once; and that was in the courtroom, at Mrs Sucksby's trial. The trial came up very quick. I spent the nights before it at Lant Street, lying awake in my old bed; sometimes Dainty came back, to sleep beside me and keep me company. She was the only one, out of all my old pals, who would: for of course, everyone else supposed -- from the story having been put about, before -- that I was a cheat. It came out that I had taken that room, in the house across from Mr Ibbs's; and had lived there, in what seemed a sneaking sort of way, for almost a week. Why had I done that? Then someone said they saw me running, on the night of the murder, with a look of wildness in my eye. They talked about my mother, and the bad blood that flowed in me. They didn't say I was brave, now; they said I was bold. They said they wouldn't have been surprised if it was me that had put the knife in, after all; and Mrs Sucksby -- who still loved me like a daughter, though I had turned out bad -- who had stepped forward and taken the blame…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我再没跟他说过话了。他在别人家里为他自己和达蒂找了个房间，就没在我面前晃了。我又见到他，也只见了一次；那是在法庭上，开庭审判萨克丝贝太太那次。那场审判来的非常快。审判之前的那些夜晚里，我都在蓝特街，躺在我原先睡的那张床上，彻夜难眠；有时候达蒂会回来，睡在我身边，给我做伴。她是我旧日伙伴中，唯一一个这么做的人：因为，当然了，每个人都以为——从之前散播出去的风言风语里——我是个骗子。还说我藏在艾伯斯先生家对面房子的房间里；住在那儿，几乎算得上鬼鬼祟祟了，住了差不多一个星期。我为什么要那么做呢？这时就有人说，案发那天夜里，他们看到我一脸疯狂地跑过去。他们说起我的母亲，还有流淌在我身体里，我血里的恶根。现在他们不说我胆子大。总之，他们说如果是我捅的那一刀，他们也不会觉得惊奇；而萨克丝贝太太——尽管我学坏了，她还是一如既往，把我当女儿一样疼爱——她冲到前面，一力承担了所有责难…">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At any other time it would have broken my heart. Now, I did not care. I had only one thought, and that was to see Mrs Sucksby as often as I could. They had her in the Horsemonger Lane Gaol: I spent all my days there -- sitting on the step outside the gate, when it was too early to be let in; talking with her keepers, or with the man who was to plead her case in court. Some pal of Mr Ibbs's had found him for us; he was said to have regularly saved the worst sort of villains from the rope. But he told me, honestly, that our case was a bad one. The most we can hope," he said, "is that the judge show mercy, for the sake of her age."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="换了别的时候，这就能让我心碎了。如今，我也不在乎了。我只有一个念头，就是尽我所能，多去看看萨克丝贝太太。他们把她关在豪斯蒙格街监狱：我白天都守在那儿——如果去得太早，还不得入内，我就坐在门外的台阶上；我跟看守她的人谈话，还跟将要在法庭上为她辩护的人谈话。他是艾伯斯先生的某个熟人帮我们找来的；据说，他总是能把那种坏得透顶的恶棍从绞索上救下来。可是，他如实地告诉我，我们的案子是一件棘手的案子。“我们最大的希望，”他说道，“就是法官顾念到她的年纪，能发发慈悲。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I did not know, and could not answer. He would leave me then, at the gate of the gaol -- going quickly off, stepping into the street and calling out for a cabman; and I'd watch him go with my hands at my head, for his shout, and the rattle of hooves and wheels, the movement of people, the very stones beneath my feet, would seem harsh to me.

<div class="line_en">I would have written letters; if I had known how to write, and who to send them to. I would have gone to the house of the man who was to be judge; if I had known how to find it. But I did nothing like that. What little comfort I got, I got at Mrs Sucksby's side; and the gaol, though it was so grim -- so dark, and bleak -- at least was also quiet. I got to spend more time there than I ought to have, through the kindness of the keepers: I think they thought me younger and less of a sharper than I was. "Here's your daughter," they'd say, unlocking the gate to Mrs Sucksby's cell; and every time, she would quickly lift her head and study my face, or glance beyond my shoulder, with a troubled look -- as if, I thought, not quite believing they had let me come again and meant to let me stay.

<div class="line_en">So then I'd remember that dander of hers, and keep silent, and only smooth her fingers in mine. They seemed to grow thinner, every time I saw her. The keepers said she left her dinners quite untouched.

<div class="line_cn" title="于是，这时候我想起她发脾气的样子，便不说话了，只是摩挲着她的手。每回我看到她，都觉得她的手又瘦了。看守说她的饭动也不动，就放在一旁。那双颤抖的大手令我心如刀绞，痛苦难以言表：仿佛于我而言，只要萨克丝贝太太的双手能够重焕容光，所有的事情，那些错得离谱的事儿，就都能拨乱反正了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I had spent what money there was in the house at Lant Street, on finding a lawyer; but all that I could make now through borrowing or pawning I put on little dishes to try and tempt her -- on shrimps, and saveloys, and suet-puddings. Once I took her a sugar mouse, thinking she might remember the time she had put me in her bed and told me about Nancy from Oliver Twist. I don't think she did, however; she only took it and set it distractedly aside, saying she would try it later, like she did with everything else. In the end her keepers told me to save my money.

It had all come out, how she was Gentleman's wife, and had supposedly been in a madhouse and had escaped; and how the police didn't know what to do with her -- whether to let her go, or lock her up as a lunatic, or what. Dr Christie said only he could decide; so they called him in to examine her. I nearly had a fit when I heard that. I still couldn't go near bath-tubs. But what happened, was this: he took one look at her, was seen to stagger and grow white; then declared himself only overcome with emotion, to find her so perfectly cured. He said this showed how good his methods were. He had the papers give details of his house. He got lots of new lady patients out of it, I think, and quite made his fortune.</div>

<div class="line_en">But, as I have said, she never did. What came instead, was the day of the trial. It came in the middle of August. The sun had kept on blazing all through that awful summer, and the court -- being packed with watchers -- was close: every hour a man was called to throw water on the floor to try and cool it. I sat with Dainty. I'd hoped I might sit in the box with Mrs Sucksby, and hold her hand; but the policemen laughed in my face when I asked it. They made her sit alone, and when they took her in and out of the room, they put cuffs on her. She wore a grey prison gown that made her face seem almost yellow, but her silver hair shone very bright against the dark wood walls of the court. She flinched when she first came up, and saw the crowd of strangers that had come to see her tried. Then she found out my face among them and grew, I thought, more easy. Her eye came back to mine, after that, as the day went on -- though I saw her looking, too, about the court, as if in search of another. At the last, however, her gaze would always fall.</div>

<div class="line_en">I nearly started out of my seat, when I heard that. Then I caught Mrs Sucksby's eye. She shook her head, and looked so pleadingly at me to be silent, I fell back; and it never came out that the knife was sharp not because she had sharpened it, but because I had. They never called me to the stand. Mrs Sucksby would not let them. They did call Charles; but he wept so hard, and shook so badly, the judge declared him unfit. He was sent back to his aunty's. No-one was told about me, and Maud. No-one mentioned Briar or old Mr Lilly. No-one came forward to say that Gentleman was a villain -- that he had tried to rob heiresses -- that he had ruined people through the selling of counterfeit stock. They made out that he was a decent young man with a promising future; they said that Mrs Sucksby had robbed him of it through simple greed. They even found out his family, and brought his parents to the trial -- and you'll never believe it, but it turned out that all his tales of being a gentleman's son were so much puff. His father and mother ran a small kind of draper's shop, in a street off the Holloway Road. His sister taught piano. His real name was not Richard Rivers or even Richard Wells; it was Frederick Bunt. They drew his picture in the papers. Girls all over England were said to have cut it out and worn it next to their hearts.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then I looked at her face; and saw the spirit and heat and colour half-gone from it, already. She was looking dully about her, at the murmuring crowd -- looking for me, I thought, and I rose, and lifted my hand. But she caught my eye, and her gaze, as it had before, moved on: I watched it roam about the room, as if looking for someone or something else -- finally it settled and seemed to clear, and I followed it and picked out, at the back of the rows of watchers, a girl dressed all in black, with a veil, that she was just putting down -- It was Maud. I saw her, not expecting to see her: and I'll tell you this, my heart flew open; then I remembered everything, and my heart flew shut. She looked miserable -- that was something, I thought. She was sitting alone. She made no sort of sign -- to me, I mean; and none to Mrs Sucksby.</div>

<div class="line_en">But when I looked at that picture -- and when I heard people talk of the awful murder of Mr Bunt, and of vices, and sordid trades -- it seemed to me as though they must be talking of something else, something else entirely, not of Gentleman, being hurt, by mistake, in my own kitchen, with my own people all about. Even when the judge sent off the jury, and we waited, and watched the newspaper-men getting ready to run with the verdict as soon as it came; even when the jury, after an hour, returned, and one of them stood and gave back their answer in a single word; even when the judge covered up his horsehair wig with a cloth of black, and hoped that God would have mercy on Mrs Sucksby's soul -- even then, I did not really feel it as you would suppose I might, did not believe, I think, that so many dark and sober gentlemen speaking so many grave and monotonous words could pinch out the spirit and the heat and the colour from the lives of people like me and Mrs Sucksby.</div>

It was a day, almost, without darkness -- for they kept lights in her cell, that burned all through the night; and in the hours I could not be with her, I kept lights burning at Lant Street -- every light I could find in the house, and every light I could borrow. I sat alone, with blazing eyes. I sat and watched, as though she might be ill at my side. I hardly ate. I hardly changed my clothes.

<div class="line_en">I tried not to think of that, however -- or rather, like before, I found I could not think of it, could not believe it. How much Mrs Sucksby brooded upon it, I can't say.

It was me who wept, and she sat in her prison chair and let me kneel with my head in her lap, and she put her fingers to my hair -- taking the pins from it and letting it fall, until it lay across her knee.

There was a little window, high in the wall of her cell, that let in two or three strips of sunlight: we watched them creep across the stone flags of the floor. I never knew light could creep like that. It crept, like fingers.

I didn't want it, and neither did she; but she had stolen a purse to buy it, and so I got out bowls and spoons and we ate it slowly, in silence, looking all the time, as we did, at the clock -- the old Dutch clock on the mantel -- that we knew was steadily ticking, ticking away the last few hours of Mrs Sucksby's life…</div>

I thought of Mrs Sucksby, in her bright cell. I thought of her, in all the ways I had seen her, not there, but here, in her own kitchen: dosing babies, sipping tea, lifting up her face so I might kiss it. I thought of her carving meat, wiping her mouth, and yawning… The clock ticked on -- quicker, and louder, it seemed to me, than it had ever ticked before. I put my head upon the table, upon my arms.

<div class="line_en">But then, after a while the sounds grew fainter still; and that was worse, for it meant that the people had all passed on, found their spots for watching from, and it was almost time. I left Charley then, and climbed the next set of stairs alone -- climbed them slowly, like a girl with limbs of lead; then stood at the attic door, afraid to go in. There was the bed I had been born in. There was the washstand, the bit of oil-cloth tacked to the wall. The last time I had come here, Gentleman had been alive and drunk and dancing with Dainty and John, downstairs. I had stood at the window, put my thumb to the glass, made the frost turn to dirty water. Mrs Sucksby had come and stroked my hair… I went to the window, now. I went, and looked, and almost swooned away, for the streets of the Borough, that had been dark and empty then, were bright, and filled with people -- so many people! -- people standing in the road, stopping the traffic; and besides them, people on walls, on sills, clinging to posts and trees and chimneys.</div>

<div class="line_en">They were looking at the roof of the gate of the gaol. The scaffold was up, the rope already on it. A man was walking about, examining the drop. I saw him do it, feeling almost calm, feeling almost sick. I remembered what Mrs Sucksby had asked, with her last words to me: that I should watch her. I had said I would. I had thought I should bear it. It seemed such a little thing to bear, compared with what she must suffer…</div>

<div class="line_en">But I said it; and then came the slow, steady striking of ten o'clock. The man at the rope stood down, the door to the prison steps was thrown open, the chaplain showed himself upon the roof, and then the first of the keepers. -- I couldn't do it. I put my back to the window and covered my face with my hands. I knew what followed, then, from the sounds that rose up from the streets. The people had fallen silent at the striking of the clock, the coming of the chaplain; now I heard them all start up with hisses and with hoots -- that, I knew, was for the hangman. I heard the very spreading of the sound about the crowd, like oil on water. When the hoots grew louder, I knew the hangman had made some sign or bow. Then, in an instant, the sound turned again, moved faster, like a shiver, like a thrill, through the streets: the cry was sent out: "Hats off!", and was mixed with bursts of dreadful laughter. Mrs Sucksby must have come. They were trying to see her. I grew sicker than ever, imagining all those strangers' eyes straining out of their sockets to see what figure she would make, yet not being able to look, myself; but I could not, I could not. I could not turn, or tear the sweating hands from before my face. I could only listen. I heard the laughter change to murmurs and calls for hush: that meant the chaplain was saying prayers. The hush went on, and on. My own heartbeats seemed to fill it. Then the Amen was said; and even while the word was still travelling about the streets, other parts of the crowd -- the parts that were nearest the gaol and could see best -- broke out in an uneasy sort of murmur. The murmur grew louder, got taken up by every throat -- then turned, to something more like a moan, or groan… And I knew that meant that they had led her up to the scaffold; that they were tying her hands, and covering up her face, and putting, about her neck, the noose…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可等我说完；随后就传来十点整的钟声，缓慢而平稳。绞架上的那个男人停住手，通往监狱台阶的门被人撞开了，监狱牧师出现在屋顶上，然后紧跟着的是几个看守。——我看不下去了。我转过身去，背对窗户，双手捂住了脸。然后，听到街上渐起的声浪，我便知道接下去是什么了。人们听到钟声，看到牧师，忽又安静了；这时候，我听到他们一阵骚动，嘴里唏嘘有声，脚下也移动起来——我知道，是他们看见了刽子手。我听到这声音在人群中迅速散播开来，好象油滴到了水里。听到起哄声渐响，我知道是刽子手做了个什么动作，或是鞠了一躬。然后，就一刹那的工夫，声音又变了，传得更快，就好象一个寒战，就好象一激灵，穿过条条街道：一声大喊：“帽子摘了！”，人群里爆发出一阵令人伤心的笑声，叫声跟笑声混在一起。肯定是萨克丝贝太太被带上来了。他们想看看她的样子。我更加难受了，想象着这些陌生人想看清楚她的模样，眼珠都快从眼框里瞪出来了，而我自己却没有勇气看一眼。可是我真的不能，我不能。我无法转过身去，也无法放下捂在脸上的汗津津的双手。我只能听。我听见笑声变成了窃窃私语，和呼吁安静的嘘声：这表明监狱牧师在念祷词，静默在延续，延续。我自己的心跳好象也停滞了。这时候，他们说了阿门；而正当阿门声还在坊间传播时，人群的另一部分——离监狱最近，看得最清楚的那一部分——发出一种令人不快的窃窃议论声。议论的声音变响了，从每个人的喉咙里发出来——然后又变了，变成了某种声音，更象是悲鸣，或者呻吟…我知道，这意味着他们把她带上了绞架；他们捆住她的双手，蒙住她的脸，放下了绞索，套在她脖子上…">查看中文翻译</div>

There came more hoots, more cries, more dreadful laughter; and finally, cheers. I think I had used to cheer myself, at other hangings. I never thought what the cheering meant. Now I listened as those hurrahs went up, and it seemed to me, even in my grief, that I understood. She's dead, they might as well have been calling.

He knew a man with a roof, he said; and went off to climb it. I wondered if he had watched at all; but didn't say that to Dainty. She herself had seen everything, except the final drop. Phil, who had seen even that, said the fall was a clean one. He thought it was true, after all, what people said, about how the hangman put the knot, when it came to dropping women. Everyone agreed, anyway, that Mrs Sucksby had held herself very boldly, and died very game.</div>

I had become an orphan again; and as orphans everywhere must, I began, in the two or three weeks that followed, to look about me, with a sinking heart; to understand that the world was hard and dark, and I must make my own way through it, quite alone. I had no money. The rent on the shop and house had fallen due in August: a man had come and banged on the door, and only gone because Dainty bared her arms and said she would hit him. He had left us alone since then. I think the house had got known as a murder-house, and no-one wanted to take it. But I knew they would, in time. I knew the man would come back one day, with other men, and break in the door. Where would I live, then? How should I do, on my own? I might, I supposed, take a regular job, at a dairy, a dyer's, a furrier's -- The very thought of it, however, made me want to be sick. Everybody in my world knew that regular work was only another name for being robbed and dying of boredom. I should rather stay crooked. Dainty said she knew three girls who worked, in a gang, as streetthieves, Woolwich-way, and wanted a fourth… But she said it, not quite catching my eye; for we both knew that street-thieving was a pretty poor lay, compared to what I was used to.</div>

<div class="line_en">But it was all I had; and I thought it might as well do. I hadn't the heart for finding out anything better. I hadn't the heart or the spirit for anything at all. Bit by bit, everything that was left at Lant Street had gone -- been pawned, or sold. I still wore the pale print dress I had robbed from the woman in the country! -- and now it looked worse on me than ever, for I had grown thin at Dr Christie's, and then thinner still. Dainty said I had got so sharp, if you could have found a way of threading me with cotton, you could have sewn with me. And so, when I packed the bits of stuff I wanted to take with me to Woolwich, there was almost nothing. And when I thought of the people I ought to call on, to say good-bye to, I could not think of anyone. There was only one thing I knew I must do, before I went; and that was the picking up of Mrs Sucksby's things, from Horsemonger Lane.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then they led me back, across the yards, through the grey prison ground where I knew Mrs Sucksby was buried, with no stone upon her grave, so no-one could come and mourn her; and they took me out under the gate, with its low, flat roof, where I had last seen the scaffold raised. They passed under that roof every day of their lives, it was nothing to them. When they came to say good-bye, they made to take my hand. I could not give it. The parcel was light. I carried it home, however, in a sort of dread; and the dread seemed to make it heavy.</div>

<div class="line_en">At last, I lifted the parcel to my mouth and took hold of the knots with my teeth: and finally the strings unravelled and the paper sprang out of its folds. I started back. Mrs Sucksby's shoes, her petticoats and comb came tumbling out upon the table-top, looking just as I had feared. And across them, dark and spreading, like tar, came her old black taffeta gown. I had not thought of that. Why hadn't I? It was the very worst thing of all. It looked like Mrs Sucksby herself was lying there, in some sort of swoon. The gown still had Maud's brooch pinned to its breast. Someone had prised the diamonds out -- I didn't care about that -- but the silver claws that were left had blood in them, brown blood, so dried it was almost powder. The taffeta itself was stiff. The blood had made it rusty. The rust was traced about with lines of white: the lawyers had shown the gown in court, and had drawn around each stain with chalk.</div>

<div class="line_en">I began to rub. Dainty rubbed, too. We rubbed in the same grim, shuddering way that we had scrubbed the kitchen floor. The cloths grew muddy. Our breaths came quick. We worked first at the skirt. Then I caught up the collar, drew the bodice to me and began to work on that. And, as I did, the gown made a curious sound -- a creaking, or rustling, sound.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我开始搓那件衣裳。达蒂也搓。就跟先前擦厨房地板一样，我们以一种令人生畏的，战栗着的劲头儿搓着衣裳。衣裳变得一塌糊涂。我们的呼吸也急促起来。然后我又抓起衣领，将衣裳拽到面前，开始搓衣裳上半身。随着我不停地搓，衣裳发出一阵奇怪的声响——是撕裂声，还是沙沙声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But when I lifted the dress and shook it, and looked inside, there was nothing, nothing at all. The rustling came again, however, as I laid the gown back down. It seemed to me that it came from part of the bodice -- from that part of the front of the bodice that would have lain just below Mrs Sucksby's heart. I put my hand to it, and felt about. The taffeta there was stiff -- stiff not just from the staining of Gentleman's blood, but from something else, something that had got stuck, or been put, behind it, between it and the satin lining of the gown. What was it? I could not tell, from feeling. So then I turned the bodice insideout, and looked at the seam. The seam was open: the satin was loose, but had been hemmed so as not to fray. It made a sort of pocket, in the gown. I looked at Dainty; then put in my hand. It rustled again, and she drew back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是，当我举起衣裳，抖了两下，再往里面看时，里面什么也没有，空空如也。然而，我一放下衣裳，那种沙沙声又来了。我觉得那声音好象来自衣裳的上半身——来自上半身的正面，就是萨克丝贝太太心口下面的地方。我伸手抓住那片衣裳，在手里捏了捏。那块塔夫绸料子挺硬的——倒不是因为有绅士的血污而坚硬，却是因为别的什么东西，先前给人缝进去，或塞进去的某样东西，在塔夫绸和缎子衬里之间。是什么呢？仅凭感觉，我也说不出。所以我把衣裳内里翻出来，查看布料的接缝处。我看看达蒂；然后将手伸进去。衣裳又沙沙作响，达蒂身子缩了回去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And so I left the Borough a second time, and made the journey down to Briar, over again. There were no fogs, this time. The train ran smooth. At Marlow, the same guard who had laughed at me when I'd asked for a cab, now came to help me from the coach. He didn't remember me. He wouldn't have known me if he had. I was so thin, I think he thought I was an invalid girl. "Come down from London to take the air, have you?" he said kindly. He looked at the little bag I held. "Shall you manage it?"

<div class="line_en">So they put me down where the wall to the Briar park started; and from there, I walked again. The sound of the horse's hooves grew faint. The road was lonely, the day was bleak. It was only two or three o'clock, but the dusk seemed gathered in the shadows already, waiting to creep and rise. The wall seemed longer than when I had ridden past it in William Inker's trap: I walked for what felt like an hour, before I saw the arch that marked the gate, and the roof of the lodge behind it. I quickened my step -- but then, my heart quite sank. The lodge was all shut up and dark. The gates were fastened with a chain and lock, and piled about with leaves. Where the wind struck the iron bars it made a low sort of moaning sound. And when I stepped to the gates and pushed them, they creaked and creaked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是，到了布莱尔花园围墙的地界，他们便把我放下；我从这儿又开始步行。马蹄声渐渐远去。这条路挺偏僻，天色也阴沉沉的。这会儿也就是两三点，可树阴里似乎已有阴霾汇聚，伺机而动。相比从前，我坐威廉。英克尔的马车经过此地时的光景，这围墙似乎变长了：在看到标志着大门的拱顶，和大门里面的门房屋顶之前，我走了感觉有一个钟头。我加快了脚步——可是这时，我的心一沉。门房间门窗紧闭，昏暗凋敝。大门上拴着一根链子，上了锁，门口堆满树叶。风扑在铁栏杆上，带起了某种低沉的呜咽声。当我走到门前，推动大门时，大门吱吱嘎嘎地响啊响。">查看中文翻译</div>

But it didn't: the birds went cawing on, the wind moaned louder through the bars, I called another time; and no-one came. So then I looked at the chain and lock. The chain was a long one. It was only there, I think, to keep out cows, and boys. I was thinner than a boy, however, now. I thought, "It's not against the law. I used to work here. I might work here, still…" I pushed the gates again, as far as they would go: and they made a gap just wide enough for me to wriggle my way through.</div>

The grass in the park was overgrown too, and parched from the summer, but beaten about with rain. It was turning to slime at its tips, and smelt peculiar. I think there were mice in it.

<div class="line_en">I began to go quicker. The road ran down, then began to climb. I remembered driving along it with William Inker, in the dark. I knew what was coming: I knew where it turned, and what I would see when it did… I knew it; but it still made me start, to come so suddenly upon the house again -- to see it seem to rise out of the earth, so grey and grim. I stopped, on the edge of the walk of gravel. I was almost afraid. It was all so perfectly quiet and dark. The windows were shuttered. There were more black birds upon the roof. The ivy on the walls had lost its hold and was waving like hair. The great front door -- that was always swollen, from the rain -- bulged worse than ever. The porch was rilled with more wet leaves. It seemed like a house not meant for people but for ghosts. I remembered, suddenly, what the man and the girl had said, about it being haunted…</div>

<div class="line_en">That made me shiver. I looked about me -- back, the way I had come; and then, across the lawns. They ran into dark and tangled woods. The paths I had used to take with Maud, had disappeared. I put back my head. The sky was grey and spitting rain. The wind still whispered and sighed in the trees. I shivered again. The house seemed to watch me. I thought, "If I can only find Mr Way! Where can he be?" -- and I began to walk, around to the back of the house, to the stables and yards. I went carefully, for my steps sounded loud. But here, it was just as quiet and empty as everywhere else. No dogs started barking. The stable doors were open, the horses gone. The great white clock was there, but the hands -- this shocked me, more than anything -- the hands were stuck, the hour was wrong. The clock had not chimed, all the time I had walked: it was that, I think, that had made the silence so strange. "Mr Way!" I called -- but I called it softly. It seemed wrong to call out, here.

<div class="line_en">Then I saw, rising up from one of the chimneys, a single thread of smoke. That gave me heart. I went to the kitchen door, and tapped. No answer. I tried the handle. Locked. Then I went to the garden door -- the door that I had run from, that night, with Maud. That was also locked. So then I went around to the front again. I went to a window, drew back a shutter, and looked inside. I could not see. I put my hands and my face to the glass; and the window, as I pressed, seemed to give against its bolt…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时我看到，一缕轻烟从一个烟囱中袅袅升起。这令我精神一振。我跑到厨房门口叩门。无人应答。我转转门把手。门上了锁。于是我跑到花园门——就是那天夜里，我跟莫德一道出逃的门。那扇门也锁着。于是我又绕到了前门。我走到一扇窗户跟前，拉开了百叶窗，朝里面张望起来。我什么都看不到。我将双手和面孔凑到窗玻璃上；随着我的挤压，那扇窗好象顶到了插销…">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I hesitated for almost a minute; then the rain came, hard as hail. I gave a shove. The bolt flew from its screws and the window swung inwards.

What if Mr Way had heard it and came with a gun, supposing me a burglar? I felt like a burglar, now. I thought of my mother -- My mother was never a thief, however. My mother was a lady. My mother was the lady of this great house… I shook my head. I should never believe it.</div>

<div class="line_en">The door was closed: I do not think it had been opened in many weeks. But still, when I turned the handle and pushed it, it moved perfectly silently. All the doors moved silently, in that house. The floor had a dusty carpet, that smothered my steps.</div>

But I had used to try and imagine Maud, as she sat, with her uncle, at her supper; I had used to imagine the little bites she would take at her meat… I stepped to the table. It was still set, with candlesticks, a knife and a fork, a plate of apples; but it was covered all over with dust and cobwebs, and the apples had rotted. The air was thick. Upon the floor was a broken glass -- a crystal glass, with gold at the rim.</div>

<div class="line_en">So when I went, I made no sound, and might have glided -- as if I were a ghost. The thought was queer. Across from me was another door: the door to the drawing-room. I had never been there, either; so now I crossed to it and looked inside. That room was also dark and hung with cobwebs. There was ash spilling out from the grate. There were chairs, by the hearth, where I thought that Mr Lilly and Gentleman must once have sat, to listen while Maud read books. There was a hard little sofa, with a lamp beside it, that I imagined had been hers. I imagined her sitting there, now. I remembered her soft voice. I forgot to think about Mr Way, remembering that. I forgot to think of my mother. What was she, to me? It was Maud I thought of. I had meant to go down to the kitchen. Instead I went slowly about the hall, by the swollen front door. I climbed the stairs. I wanted to go to her old rooms. I wanted to stand, where she had stood -- at the window, at the glass. I wanted to lie upon her bed. I wanted to think how I had kissed her and lost her…</div>

<div class="line_en">I reached the gallery. The door to the library was there, standing part-way open. The creature's head still hung beside it, with its one glass eye and pointed teeth. I thought of how I had put my fingers to it, the first time I came for Maud. I had waited outside the door, I had heard her reading. -- Again, I thought of her voice. I thought so fiercely of it, it seemed to me at last that I could almost hear it. I could hear it as a whisper, as a murmur, in the stillness of the house. I caught my breath. The murmur stopped, then started again. It was not in my own head, I could hear it -- it came, from the library… I began to shake. Perhaps the house was haunted after all. Or perhaps, perhaps -- I moved to the door and put a trembling hand to it, and pushed it open. Then I stood, and blinked. The room was changed. The paint had all been scraped from the windows, the finger of brass prised from the floor. The shelves were almost bare of books. A little fire burned in the grate.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我来到画廊里。书房的门就在那儿，门虚掩着。门旁边依旧挂着动物脑袋标本，带着一只玻璃眼珠和尖利的牙齿。我想起第一次来接莫德，我是如何将手放在这个标本上。我当时等在门外，我当时听到她在念书。——我再一次地，想起了她的声音。我极度思念她的声音，最后，我仿佛又听她在说话。于静谧之中，我听到她的喃喃低语。我屏住呼吸。这低语停住，随后又响起。这不是我头脑里的声音，我能听出来——这声音是书房里传来的…我开始颤抖。说不定这宅子里真的闹鬼。要么，说不定，说不定——我走到门口，伸出一只颤抖的手，将门推开。然后我站在那儿，眨眨眼睛。这个房间变了个样儿。窗玻璃上的油漆被刮掉了，那黄铜做的手指从地板中翘了起来。书架上几乎没什么书了。壁炉里生着一堆小火。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then she wrote again; and then she moved to dip her pen in a jar of ink. And as she did that, she drew her fingers from her eyes, her face came up; and she saw me watching. She did not start. She grew perfectly still. She did not cry out. She did not say anything, at first. She only sat with her eyes on mine, a look of astonishment on her face. Then I took a step; and as I did, she got to her feet, letting the pen with the ink upon it roll across the papers and desk and drop to the floor. Her cheek had grown white.

<div class="line_en">I pushed the door further. There was Mr Lilly's old desk. Its lamp was lit. And in the glow of it, was Maud. She was sitting, writing. She had an elbow on the desk, a cheek upon her upturned hand, her fingers half-curled over her eyes. I saw her clearly, because of the light. Her brows were drawn into a frown. Her hands were bare, her sleeves put back, her fingers dark with smudges of ink. I stood and watched her write a line. The page was thick with lines already. Then she lifted the pen, and turned and turned it, as if not sure what to put next. Again she murmured, beneath her breath. She bit her mouth.</div>

They were bare, and marked, as I have said, with spots and smudges of ink. Her brow had ink upon it, too, from where she had pressed it. Her dress was dark, and long, yet fell not quite to the floor.

<div class="line_en">She picked up a paper from the desk -- the paper that I had seen her write on. The ink was still damp. "I asked a friend of my uncle's, once," she said, "if I might write for him. He sent me to a home for distressed gentlewomen." She smiled, unhappily. They say that ladies don't write such things. But, I am not a lady…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她从书桌上拣起一张纸——就是先前我看到她书写的那张纸。纸上墨迹未干。“我曾经问过我舅舅的一位朋友，”她说道，“我是否可以帮他写点东西。他把我送到收留落魄良家妇女的地方。”她苦笑。“他们说良家妇女不写这种东西。但是，我不是良家妇女。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Hate you!" I said. "When I have fifty proper reasons for hating you, already; and only --" Only love you, I wanted to say. I didn't say it, though. What can I tell you? If she could still be proud, then so, for now, could I… I didn't need to say it, anyway: she could read the words in my face. Her colour changed, her gaze grew clearer. She put a hand across her eyes. Her fingers left more smudges of black there. I still couldn't bear it. I quickly reached and stopped her wrist; then wet my thumb and began to rub at the flesh of her brow. I did it, thinking only of the ink, and her white skin; but she felt my hand and grew very still. My thumb moved slower. It moved to her cheek. Then I found I had cupped her face in my hand. She closed her eyes. Her cheek was smooth -- not like a pearl, warmer than pearls. She turned her head and put her mouth against my palm. Her lips were soft. The smudge stayed black upon her brow; and after all, I thought, was only ink.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“讨厌你！”我说道。“我都有五十个名正言顺的理由恨你了；我——”我想说的是，我爱你。可我没说出口。我该怎么跟你说呢？要是她还这么傲气，那么我，那会儿，我能…反正，无须我亲口说出：她能从我脸上读出我的心意。她神色变了。她的目光变得更加清亮。她一只手捂住眼睛。她的手在眉眼间留下更多的黑色污迹。我还是看不惯。我迅速抬手拉住她的手腕；然后沾湿大拇指，开始擦她眉头的污迹。我手里擦着，心里只想着墨水，和她雪白的皮肤；而她则一动不动。我手里慢下来。我的手移到她的脸颊上。这时我发觉我已将她的脸捧在手中。她闭起双眼。她的脸颊十分光洁——并不像珍珠，比珍珠更温润。她侧过头，嘴唇贴到我掌心里。她双唇非常柔软。她眉头的污迹还是黑的；我觉得，其实那只是墨水。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She took up the lamp. The room had got darker, the rain still beat against the glass. But she led me to the fire and made me sit, and sat beside me. Her silk skirts rose in a rush, then sank. She put the lamp upon the floor, spread the paper flat; and began to show me the words she had written, one by one.</div>
