<div class="line_en">They gave him a horse and a banner, a soft woolen doublet and a warm fur cloak, and set him loose. For once, he did not stink. "Come back with that castle," said Damon Dance-for-Me as he helped Reek climb shaking into the saddle, "or keep going and see how far you get before we catch you. He'd like that, he would." Grinning, Damon gave the horse a lick across the rump with his whip, and the old stot whinnied and lurched into motion.</div>

<div class="line_en">Reek did not dare to look back, for fear that Damon and Yellow Dick and Grunt and the rest were coming after him, that all of this was just another of Lord Ramsay's japes, some cruel test to see what he would do if they gave him a horse and set him free. Do they think that I will run? The stot they had given him was a wretched thing, knock-kneed and half-starved; he could never hope to outdistance the fine horses Lord Ramsay and his hunters would be riding. And Ramsay loved nothing more than to set his girls baying on the trail of some fresh prey.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="臭佬不敢回头，他害怕达蒙，害怕那Yellow Dick（这啥？黄小子？黄JJ？），害怕那咕哝声，害怕跟在他身后的一切。这一切都是拉姆斯大人的恶作剧，臭佬想，一个残忍的考验。给我一匹马，释放我，然后看我会干什么。他们以为我会逃走？他们给了我一匹罗圈腿，而且饿得半死的可怜畜生，没有任何指望能跑过拉姆斯大人那些骑着良马的猎手。拉姆斯大人最喜欢让他的猎犬们狂吠着追逐那些鲜嫩的猎物。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Besides, where would he run to? Behind him were the camps, crowded with Dreadfort men and those the Ryswells had brought from the Rills, with the Barrowton host between them. South of Moat Cailin, another army was coming up the causeway, an army of Boltons and Freys marching beneath the banners of the Dreadfort. East of the road lay a bleak and barren shore and a cold salt sea, to the west the swamps and bogs of the Neck, infested with serpents, lizard lions, and bog devils with their poisoned arrows.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此外，他能往哪儿跑？他的身后是军营，挤满了恐怖堡的人马和Ryswells从溪流地带来的军队，还有达斯汀伯爵夫人的部属。卡林湾以南的大路上，波顿大人和弗雷家的军队正高擎恐怖堡的旗帜向北开进。在大路东边，是咬人湾荒凉贫瘠的海岸和冰冷咸涩的海水。在西边，是绵延无际的的颈泽，到处游荡着毒蛇，蜥狮，还有带着毒箭的沼泽魔鬼。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When that other man had come this way, an army had followed close behind him, the great host of the north riding to war beneath the grey-and-white banners of House Stark. Reek rode alone, clutching a peace banner on a pinewood staff. When that other man had come this way, he had been mounted on a courser, swift and spirited. Reek rode a broken-down stot, all skin and bone and ribs, and he rode her slowly for fear he might fall off. The other man had been a good rider, but Reek was uneasy on horseback. It had been so long. He was no rider. He was not even a man. He was Lord Ramsay's creature, lower than a dog, a worm in human skin. "You will pretend to be a prince," Lord Ramsay told him last night, as Reek was soaking in a tub of scalding water, "but we know the truth. You're Reek. You'll always be Reek, no matter how sweet you smell. Your nose may lie to you. Remember your name. Remember who you are."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Do this little thing for me, and you can be my dog and eat meat every day," Lord Ramsay promised. "You will be tempted to betray me. To run or fight or join our foes. No, quiet, I'll not hear you deny it. Lie to me, and I'll take your tongue. A man would turn against me in your place, but we know what you are, don't we?

<div class="line_en">Reek knew the cost. Seven, he thought, seven fingers. A man can make do with seven fingers. Seven is a sacred number. He remembered how much it had hurt when Lord Ramsay had commanded Skinner to lay his ring finger bare.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="臭佬知道代价。七根，他想到，七根手指头。一个人有七根手指头也还算将就。七是一个神圣的数字。他仍然记得当拉姆斯大人命令行刽子手剥掉他无名指上的皮的时候有多么痛苦。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The air was wet and heavy, and shallow pools of water dotted the ground. Reek picked his way between them carefully, following the remnants of the log-and-plank road that Robb Stark's vanguard had laid down across the soft ground to speed the passage of his host. Where once a mighty curtain wall had stood, only scattered stones remained, blocks of black basalt so large it must once have taken a hundred men to hoist them into place. Some had sunk so deep into the bog that only a corner showed; others lay strewn about like some god's abandoned toys, cracked and crumbling, spotted with lichen. Last night's rain had left the huge stones wet and glistening, and the morning sunlight made them look as if they were coated in some fine black oil.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Drunkard's Tower leaned as if it were about to collapse, just as it had for half a thousand years. The Children's Tower thrust into the sky as straight as a spear, but its shattered top was open to the wind and rain. The Gatehouse Tower, squat and wide, was the largest of the three, slimy with moss, a gnarled tree growing sideways from the stones of its north side, fragments of broken wall still standing to the east and west. The Karstarks took the Drunkard's Tower and the Umbers the Children's Tower, he recalled. Robb claimed the Gatehouse Tower for his own.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="酒鬼塔倾斜的几乎快要倒塌，然而它已经这样子耸立了五百年。孩童塔好像长矛版直刺云霄，尽管它破烂的屋顶透风漏雨。门卫塔粗壮宽厚，是三座塔中最大的一座，却布满泥污和苔藓，一棵扭曲的怪树从北侧的塔身长了出来，残破的石墙依旧屹立在东方和西方。卡史塔克家占据了酒鬼塔，安柏家占据了孩童塔，他回忆道，罗卜则宣布门卫塔归他本人所有。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">If he closed his eyes, he could see the banners in his mind's eye, snapping bravely in a brisk north wind. All gone now, all fallen.

When he looked up, he caught a glimpse of pale faces peering from behind the battlements of the Gatehouse Tower and through the broken masonry that crowned the Children's Tower, where legend said the children of the forest had once called down the hammer of the waters to break the lands of Westeros in two.</div>

<div class="line_en">The only dry road through the Neck was the causeway, and the towers of Moat Cailin plugged its northern end like a cork in a bottle. The road was narrow, the ruins so positioned that any enemy coming up from the south must pass beneath and between them. To assault any of the three towers, an attacker must expose his back to arrows from the other two, whilst climbing damp stone walls festooned with streamers of slimy white ghostskin. The swampy ground beyond the causeway was impassable, an endless morass of suckholes, quicksands, and glistening green swards that looked solid to the unwary eye but turned to water the instant you trod upon them, the whole of it infested with venomous serpents and poisonous flowers and monstrous lizard lions with teeth like daggers. Just as dangerous were its people, seldom seen but always lurking, the swamp-dwellers, the frog-eaters, the mud-men. Fenn and Reed, Peat and Boggs, Cray and Quagg, Greengood and Blackmyre, those were the sorts of names they gave themselves. The ironborn called them all bog devils.</div>

<div class="line_en">The garrison will never know me. Some might recall the boy he'd been before he learned his name, but Reek would be a stranger to them. It had been a long while since he last looked into a glass, but he knew how old he must appear. His hair had turned white; much of it had fallen out, and what was left was stiff and dry as straw. The dungeons had left him weak as an old woman and so thin a strong wind could knock him down.</div>

<div class="line_en">Reek passed the rotted carcass of a horse, an arrow jutting from its neck. A long white snake slithered into its empty eye socket at his approach. Behind the horse he spied the rider, or what remained of him. The crows had stripped the flesh from the man's face, and a feral dog had burrowed beneath his mail to get at his entrails. Farther on, another corpse had sunk so deep into the muck that only his face and fingers showed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="臭佬越过一具腐烂的马尸，一支箭头从它的脖子里穿透出来。当他靠近的时候一条长长地白蛇蜿蜒着爬进了死马那空洞的眼眶里。在死马后边他看到了骑手。确切地说，是骑手的残余。乌鸦扯下了骑手脸上的肉，野狗钻到锁甲下面挖走了他的内脏。再往前，还有另一具已经深深陷入淤泥之中的尸体，只有脸和手指露在外面。">查看中文翻译</div>

It came from somewhere to his right, where broken chunks of the curtain wall lay half-submerged beneath the bog.

<div class="line_en">Reek scrambled up the steps on hands and knees as another arrow fluttered over his head. Someone seized him and dragged him inside, and he heard the door crash shut behind him.

<div class="line_en">Ralf was rotting too. Beneath the furs he was naked and feverish, his pale puffy flesh covered with weeping sores and scabs. His head was misshapen, one cheek grotesquely swollen, his neck so engorged with blood that it threatened to swallow his face. The arm on that same side was big as a log and crawling with white worms. No one had bathed him or shaved him for many days, from the look of him. One eye wept pus, and his beard was crusty with dried vomit.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="拉尔夫也正在腐烂。毛皮之下的他赤身裸体而且发着高烧。苍白浮肿的肉体上布满流脓的溃疡和疮痂。他的头扭曲畸形，一边脸颊夸张地肿胀起来。他的脖颈充血膨胀到几乎要把脸埋住。一侧的手臂肿胀的像一段原木，上面爬满白色的蛆虫。看起来已经有很多天没人给他洗澡，也没人给他洁面。他的一只眼睛溃疡流脓，胡须和干掉的呕吐物纠结在一起。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I did. The memory came back in a rush. Smiler's screams had sounded almost human. His mane afire, he had reared up on his hind legs, blind with pain, lashing out with his hooves. No, no. Not mine, he was not mine, Reek never had a horse. "I will kill him for you." Reek snatched up Ralf Kenning's sword where it leaned against his shield. He still had fingers enough to clasp the hilt. When he laid the edge of the blade against the swollen throat of the creature on the straw, the skin split open in a gout of black blood and yellow pus. Kenning jerked violently, then lay still. An awful stench filled the room. Reek bolted for the steps. The air was damp and cold there, but much cleaner by comparison. The ironman stumbled out after him, white-faced and struggling not to retch. Reek grasped him by the arm. "Who was second-in-command? Where are the rest of the men?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我有过。回忆席卷而来。Smlier（席恩以前坐骑的名字）的尖叫听起来就和人类一样。他的鬃毛着了火，眼睛也瞎了，痛苦不堪。他人立起来，胡乱拍打着四蹄。不，不。那不是我的马。臭佬从来都没有过马。“我会替你杀了他。”臭佬拿起拉尔夫。肯宁斜放在盾牌上的剑，他剩下的手指还足以抓牢剑柄。当他挥动利刃划开稻草堆上那个“人”肿胀的喉咙时，黑色的污血与黄色的浓汁从破裂的皮肤里喷涌而出。肯宁猛烈地痉挛了一阵，随后归于平静。一股可怕的恶臭充斥了屋子。臭佬跑到楼梯上，这里的空气潮湿而寒冷，但比较起来要清新得多。门卫跌跌撞撞地跟在他后面，脸色苍白，努力想要止住干呕。臭佬抓住了他的手臂，“谁是第二顺位的指挥官？剩下的人在哪里？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The hall was dark stone, high ceilinged and drafty, full of drifting smoke, its stone walls spotted by huge patches of pale lichen. A peat fire burned low in a hearth blackened by the hotter blazes of years past. A massive table of carved stone filled the chamber, as it had for centuries. There was where I sat, the last time I was here, he remembered. Robb was at the head of the table, with the Greatjon to his right and Roose Bolton on his left. The Glovers sat next to Helman Tallhart. Karstark and his sons were across from them.</div>

<div class="line_en">Two dozen ironborn sat drinking at the table. A few looked at him with dull, flat eyes when he entered. The rest ignored him. All the men were strangers to him. Several wore cloaks fastened by brooches in the shape of silver codfish. The Codds were not well regarded in the Iron Islands; the men were said to be thieves and cowards, the women wantons who bedded with their own fathers and brothers. It did not surprise him that his uncle had chosen to leave these men behind when the Iron Fleet went home. This will make my task that much easier. "Ralf Kenning is dead," he said. "Who commands here?"</div>

<div class="line_en">He pulled down the kraken banner with his own two hands, fumbling some because of his missing fingers but thankful for the fingers that Lord Ramsay had allowed him to keep. It took the better part of the afternoon before the ironborn were ready to depart. There were more of them than he would have guessed -- forty-seven in the Gatehouse Tower and another eighteen in the Drunkard's Tower. Two of those were so close to dead there was no hope for them, another five too weak to walk. That still left fifty-eight who were fit enough to fight. Weak as they were, they would have taken three times their own number with them if Lord Ramsay had stormed the ruins.

<div class="line_en">Three days later, the vanguard of Roose Bolton's host threaded its way through the ruins and past the row of grisly sentinels -- four hundred mounted Freys clad in blue and grey, their spearpoints glittering whenever the sun broke through the clouds. Two of old Lord Walder's sons led the van. One was brawny, with a massive jut of jaw and arms thick with muscle. The other had hungry eyes close-set above a pointed nose, a thin brown beard that did not quite conceal the weak chin beneath it, a bald head. Hosteen and Aenys. He remembered them from before he knew his name. Hosteen was a bull, slow to anger but implacable once roused, and by repute the fiercest fighter of Lord Walder's get. Aenys was older, crueler, and more clever -- a commander, not a swordsman. Both were seasoned soldiers.</div>

Somewhere in the night, men were screaming. He shoved the dog aside, rolled over, and went back to sleep.</div>

Along the rotting-plank road, wooden stakes were driven deep into the boggy ground; there the corpses festered, red and dripping. Sixty-three, he knew, there are sixty-three of them. One was short half an arm. Another had a parchment shoved between its teeth, its wax seal still unbroken.</div>

His rondels were wrought in the shape of human heads, with open mouths that shrieked in agony. From his shoulders streamed a pink woolen cloak embroidered with droplets of blood. Long streamers of red silk fluttered from the top of his closed helm. No crannogman will slay Roose Bolton with a poisoned arrow, Reek thought when he first saw him. An enclosed wagon groaned along behind him, drawn by six heavy draft horses and defended by crossbowmen, front and rear. Curtains of dark blue velvet concealed the wagon's occupants from watching eyes.</div>
