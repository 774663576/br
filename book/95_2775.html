<div class="line_en">The animosity I felt from the colored people I encountered growing up was one of the hardest things I've ever had to deal with. It taught me that it is easier to be an insider as an outsider than to be an outsider as an insider. If a white guy chooses to immerse himself in hip-hop culture and only hang out with black people, black people will say, "Cool, white guy. Do what you need to do." If a black guy chooses to button up his blackness to live among white people and play lots of golf, white people will say, "Fine. I like Brian. He's safe." But try being a black person who immerses himself in white culture while still living in the black community. Try being a white person who adopts the trappings of black culture while still living in the white community. You will face more hate and ridicule and ostracism than you can even begin to fathom. People are willing to accept you if they see you as an outsider trying to assimilate into their world. But when they see you as a fellow tribe member attempting to disavow the tribe, that is something they will never forgive. That is what happened to me in Eden Park.</div>

<div class="line_en">At the end of our street in Eden Park, right in a bend at the top of the road, stood a giant mulberry tree growing out of someone's front yard. Every year when it bore fruit the neighborhood kids would go and pick berries from it, eating as many as they could and filling up bags to take home. They would all play under the tree together. I had to play under the tree by myself. I didn't have any friends in Eden Park.</div>

<div class="line_en">Which seems ridiculous, but it would happen. Every year under apartheid, some colored people would get promoted to white. It wasn't a myth; it was real. People could submit applications to the government. Your hair might become straight enough, your skin might become light enough, your accent might become polished enough -- and you'd be reclassified as white. All you had to do was denounce your people, denounce your history, and leave your darker-skinned friends and family behind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这听上去很荒谬，但却是现实。种族隔离的那些年，每年都有一批有色人种会被提拔成白人。这不是虚构的故事，是真的。人们会向政府提交申请，你的头发要足够直，皮肤要足够白，口音要足够纯正——这样你就可以被改归为白人梯队。你所要做的不过是背弃你的人民，你的历史，远离你的黑皮肤朋友和家人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When apartheid came, colored people defied easy categorization, so the system used them -- quite brilliantly -- to sow confusion, hatred, and mistrust. For the purposes of the state, colored people became the almost-whites. They were second-class citizens, denied the rights of white people but given special privileges that black people didn't have, just to keep them holding out for more. Afrikaners used to call them amperbaas: "the almost-boss." The almost-master. "You're almost there. You're so close. You're this close to being white. Pity your grandfather couldn't keep his hands off the chocolate, eh? But it's not your fault you're colored, so keep trying. Because if you work hard enough you can erase this taint from your bloodline. Keep on marrying lighter and whiter and don't touch the chocolate and maybe, maybe, someday, if you're lucky, you can become white."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在种族隔离时期，有色人种无法被轻易归入某一类人，于是种族隔离制度就利用这一点来散播困惑、恨意和怀疑的情绪——非常机智。在政府的人种注册中，有色人种被划为“近白人”一类。他们是二等公民，没有白人的权利，但是可以享受一些黑人没有的特权，这样可以让他们更好地接受现状。南非白人曾管他们叫amperbaas，意为“近老板，近主人”。“你几乎就要达到了，就差一点儿了。你离白人就差这一点点。很可惜你的外公还是没忍住，上了个棕色人种，是吧？不过你是有色人种不是你的错，继续努力吧，如果你足够努力，就能把这个污点从血统里抹掉。和更白、肤色更浅的人通婚，不要碰棕色人种，这样也许，也许，有一天，如果你够幸运的话，你就是白人啦。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The legal definition of a white person under apartheid was "one who in appearance is obviously a white person who is generally not accepted as a coloured person; or is generally accepted as a white person and is not in appearance obviously a white person." It was completely arbitrary, in other words. That's where the government came up with things like the pencil test. If you were applying to be white, the pencil went into your hair. If it fell out, you were white. If it stayed in, you were colored. You were what the government said you were. Sometimes that came down to a lone clerk eyeballing your face and making a snap decision. Depending on how high your cheekbones were or how broad your nose was, he could tick whatever box made sense to him, thereby deciding where you could live, whom you could marry, what jobs and rights and privileges you were allowed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在法律上，种族隔离是这样定义白人的：“外表明显是白人，且通常不会被认作是有色人种；或者通常被认作是白人，但从外表上看白人特征不明显。”换句话说，这种区分方法非常随意。政府还想出了一些奇招，例如铅笔测试。如果你申请成为白人，他们会往你头发里插一根铅笔，如果铅笔滑落，你就是白人，如果卡在头发里，那你就是有色人种。政府说你是什么人你就是什么人。有的时候就是一个职员盯着你的脸打量一会儿，就能快速得出结论你是哪种人。根据你颧骨多高，鼻子多宽，他在随便哪个选项上打上几个勾，就能决定你可以住在哪个片区，可以和谁结婚，能得到怎样的工作，拥有怎样的权利，享受怎样的特权。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And colored people didn't just get promoted to white. Sometimes colored people became Indian. Sometimes Indian people became colored. Sometimes blacks were promoted to colored, and sometimes coloreds were demoted to black. And of course whites could be demoted to colored as well. That was key. Those mixed bloodlines were always lurking, waiting to peek out, and fear of losing their status kept white people in line. If two white parents had a child and the government decided that child was too dark, even if both parents produced documentation proving they were white, the child could be classified as colored, and the family had to make a decision. Do they give up their white status to go and live as colored people in a colored area? Or would they split up, the mother taking the colored child to live in the ghetto while the father stayed white to make a living to support them?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有色人种不光能提拔成白人，有时候他们也能变成印度人。有时候印度人可能变成有色人种。有时候黑人可以提拔成有色人种，有时候有色人种会被降级为黑人。当然，白人也有可能被降级为有色人种。这很关键。那些混合的血统因子潜伏在体内，生怕露出马脚，丢失白人的基因特征和身份特权。如果一对白人夫妻生下了一个小孩，而政府认为这个小孩的肤色过黑，哪怕夫妻俩都有文件证明自己是白人，小孩也会被归为有色人种，这个家庭就要做出一个艰难的决定。他们是要放弃自己的白人身份，降级为有色人种，住到有色人种聚居区去？还是说他们不得不分开，母亲带着小孩去有色人种聚居区生活，父亲留在白人区赚钱，供养妻子和孩子呢？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">That's what apartheid did: It convinced every group that it was because of the other race that they didn't get into the club. It's basically the bouncer at the door telling you, "We can't let you in because of your friend Darren and his ugly shoes." So you look at Darren and say, "Screw you, Black Darren. You're holding me back." Then when Darren goes up, the bouncer says, "No, it's actually your friend Sizwe and his weird hair." So Darren says, "Screw you, Sizwe," and now everyone hates everyone. But the truth is that none of you were ever getting into that club.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="种族隔离就是这么做的，它让每个种族相信，是因为其他种族的缘故，自己才不能进俱乐部的门。就好像门口的保镖跟你说：“我们不能让你进来，因为你的朋友达伦在旁边，而且他的鞋很丑。”于是你看着达伦，说：“去你的，黑人达伦。你拖了我的后腿。”然后达伦反击说：“去你的，斯威。”现在所有人开始怨恨所有人了。但是事实是，你们中任何一个原本也进不了俱乐部。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Many colored people lived in this limbo, a true purgatory, always yearning for the white fathers who disowned them, and they could be horribly racist to one another as a result. The most common colored slur was boesman. "Bushman." "Bushie." Because it called out their blackness, their primitiveness. The worst way to insult a colored person was to infer that they were in some way black. One of the most sinister things about apartheid was that it taught colored people that it was black people who were holding them back. Apartheid said that the only reason colored people couldn't have first-class status was because black people might use coloredness to sneak past the gates to enjoy the benefits of whiteness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="很多有色人种都活在这种混沌之下，这才是真正的炼狱。他们一边渴望着那些已经和自己脱离关系的白人父亲，另一方面又深深地歧视着彼此。对于有色人种最常见的蔑称就是布须曼人，意为“丛林人”。这个称号体现了他们的皮肤颜色和他们血统中原始的那部分东西。对有色人种最大的侮辱就是指出他们的某方面像黑人。种族隔离最阴险的做法是让有色人种觉得是黑人拖了他们的后退。种族隔离制度说，有色人种没法成为一等公民的唯一原因，就是黑人会利用这种肤色悄悄越界，获取属于白人的利益。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Colored people had it rough. Imagine: You've been brainwashed into believing that your blood is tainted. You've spent all your time assimilating and aspiring to whiteness. Then, just as you think you're closing in on the finish line, some fucking guy named Nelson Mandela comes along and flips the country on its head. Now the finish line is back where the starting line was, and the benchmark is black. Black is in charge. Black is beautiful. Black is powerful. For centuries colored people were told: Blacks are monkeys. Don't swing from the trees like them. Learn to walk upright like the white man. Then all of a sudden it's Planet of the Apes, and the monkeys have taken over.</div>

Late one afternoon I was playing by myself like I always did, running around the neighborhood. This group of five or six colored boys was up the street picking berries off the mulberry tree and eating them. I went over and started picking some to take home for myself. The boys were a few years older than me, around twelve or thirteen. They didn't talk to me, and I didn't talk to them. They were speaking to one another in Afrikaans, and I could understand what they were saying. Then one of them, this kid who was the ringleader of the group, walked over. "Mag ek jou moerbeie sien?" "Can I see your mulberries?" My first thought, again, was, Oh, cool. I made a friend. I held up my hand and showed him my mulberries. Then he knocked them out of my hand and smushed them into the ground. The other kids started laughing. I stood there and looked at him a moment. By that point I'd developed thick skin.

<div class="line_en">Half an hour later, Abel showed up. At that point Abel was still my mom's boyfriend. He wasn't trying to be my father or even a stepfather, really. He was more like a big brother than anything. He'd joke around with me, have fun. I didn't know him that well, but one thing I did know about him was that he had a temper. Very charming when he wanted to be, incredibly funny, but fuck he could be mean. He'd grown up in the homelands, where you had to fight to survive. Abel was big, too, around six-foot-three, long and lean. He hadn't hit my mom yet. He hadn't hit me yet, either. But I knew he was dangerous. I'd seen it. Someone would cut us off in traffic. Abel would yell out the window. The other guy would honk and yell back. In a flash Abel would be out of our car, over to theirs, grabbing the guy through the driver's-side window, screaming in his face, raising a fist. You'd see the other guy panic. "Whoa, whoa, whoa. I'm sorry, I'm sorry."</div>
