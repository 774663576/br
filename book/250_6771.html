<div class="line_en">The first scene is in the country, in Virginia; the time, 1880. There has been a wedding, between a handsome young man of slender means and a rich young girl; a case of love at first sight and a precipitate marriage; a marriage bitterly opposed by the girls widowed father.</div>

<div class="line_en">Jacob Fuller, the bridegroom, is twenty-six years old, is of an old but unconsidered family which had by compulsion emigrated from Sedgemoor, and for King James's purses profit, so everybody said; some maliciously, the rest merely because they believed it. The bride is nineteen and beautiful. She is intense, high-strung, romantic, immeasurably proud of her Cavalier blood, and passionate in her love for her young husband. For its sake she braved her fathers displeasure, endured his reproaches, listened with loyalty unshaken to his warning predictions, and went from his house without his blessing, proud and happy in the proofs she was thus giving of the quality of the affection which had made its home in her heart.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Sit down. I have something to say to you. I loved you. That was before I asked your father to give you to me. His refusal is not my grievance; I could have endured that. But the things he said of me to you; that is a different matter. There; you needn't speak; I know quite well what they were; I got them from authentic sources. Among other things he said that my character was written in my face; that I was treacherous, a dissembler, a coward, and a brute without sense of pity or compassion: the Sedgemoor trade-mark, he called it; and white-sleeve badge. Any other man in my place would have gone to his house and shot him down like a dog. I wanted to do it, and was minded to do it, but a better thought came to me: to put him to shame; to break his heart; to kill him by inches. How to do it? Through my treatment of you, his idol! I would marry you; and then; Have patience. You will see."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“坐下。我有话跟你说。我爱你。那是我求你父亲把你嫁给我以前的事。他不答应，我并不抱怨——这我能忍。不过，。他对你说起我的那些话，可就是另外一回事儿了。听著——你不用说，他说的那些话，我全都一清二楚；这我都有真凭实据。其中他说到，从面相就能看到我骨头里去；说我靠不住，是个伪君子、胆小鬼，一个不懂怜悯和同情的蠢货，是‘塞奇莫尔土产’、‘白套袖胚子’，他就是这么叫的。无论换了谁，都会闯到他家，把他像条狗一样杀了。我想这样干，也考虑过，可是我又想出一个更好的办法：丢他的人，碎他的心；一点一点慢慢地收拾他。怎么做这件事呢？通过整治你，他的心肝！我得和你结婚，然后——别著急。你日后就明白了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">From that moment onward, for three months, the young wife suffered all the humiliations, all the insults, all the miseries that the diligent and inventive mind of the husband could contrive, save physical injuries only. Her strong pride stood by her, and she kept the secret of her troubles. Now and then the husband said, Why don't you go to your father and tell him? Then he invented new tortures, applied them, and asked again. She always answered, He shall never know by my mouth, and taunted him with his origin; said she was the lawful slave of a scion of slaves, and must obey, and would; up to that point, but no further; he could kill her if he liked, but he could not break her; it was not in the Sedgemoor breed to do it. At the end of the three months he said, with a dark significance in his manner, I have tried all things but one; and waited for her reply. Try that, she said, and curled her lip in mockery.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从这时起，一连三个月，这位年轻的妻子尝够了丈夫发挥聪明才智、绞尽脑汁设计出来的羞辱、欺侮和痛苦，只差没受肉体折磨了。靠强烈的自尊心支撑著，她把所有的苦难深藏不露。丈夫还时不时问她：“你干吗不去你父亲那儿告诉他？”随后又发明出新招数来折磨她，折磨完了再问。她总是回答：“他永远别想从我嘴里知道。”并且拿他的出身来嘲弄他，说自己是一个奴才小子的合法奴隶，只能服从——不过也只到此为止，并不得寸进尺；只要高兴，他可以杀了她，可就是打不垮她，塞奇莫尔出身的人做不到这一点。到了三个月结束的时候，他说了一句：“我什么都试过了，只剩下一样东西还没试”——然后等著她答话。“那就试试吧，”她撇了撇嘴唇嘲弄他。">查看中文翻译</div>

The young wife shut herself up in her fathers house; he shut himself up with her, and thenceforth would see no one. His pride was broken, and his heart; so he wasted away, day by day, and even his daughter rejoiced when death relieved him.</div>
