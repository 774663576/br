<div class="line_en">Well, I got a good going-over in the morning from old Miss Watson on account of my clothes; but the widow she didn't scold, but only cleaned off the grease and clay, and looked so sorry that I thought I would behave awhile if I could. Then Miss Watson she took me in the closet and prayed, but nothing come of it. She told me to pray every day, and whatever I asked for I would get it. But it warn't so. I tried it. Once I got a fish-line, but no hooks. It warn't any good to me without hooks. I tried for the hooks three or four times, but somehow I couldn't make it work. By and by, one day, I asked Miss Watson to try for me, but she said I was a fool. She never told me why, and I couldn't make it out no way.</div>

<div class="line_en">I set down one time back in the woods, and had a long think about it. I says to myself, if a body can get anything they pray for, why don't Deacon Winn get back the money he lost on pork? Why can't the widow get back her silver snuffbox that was stole? Why can't Miss Watson fat up? No, says I to my self, there ain't nothing in it. I went and told the widow about it, and she said the thing a body could get by praying for it was "spiritual gifts." This was too many for me, but she told me what she meant – I must help other people, and do everything I could for other people, and look out for them all the time, and never think about myself. This was including Miss Watson, as I took it. I went out in the woods and turned it over in my mind a long time, but I couldn't see no advantage about it – except for the other people; so at last I reckoned I wouldn't worry about it any more, but just let it go. Sometimes the widow would take me one side and talk about Providence in a way to make a body's mouth water; but maybe next day Miss Watson would take hold and knock it all down again. I judged I could see that there was two Providences, and a poor chap would stand considerable show with the widow's Providence, but if Miss Watson's got him there warn't no help for him any more. I thought it all out, and reckoned I would belong to the widow's if he wanted me, though I couldn't make out how he was a-going to be any better off then than what he was before, seeing I was so ignorant, and so kind of low-down and ornery.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title='有一回，我在树林子后边坐着，对这件事想了好长时间。我自个儿盘算盘算，要是一做祷告，求什么就有什么，那么，教堂管事威恩为什么没能讨回他买猪肉丢失的钱？寡妇为什么就找不到被偷走的那只银器的鼻烟盒子呢？华珍小姐又为什么不能长得胖一点？不，我自言自语道，没有那么一回事。我对寡妇说了这个想法。她说，一个人，做了祷告，所能得到的是"精神方面的安慰"。这对我可太难了。不过，她倒是把她的意思都对我讲了说我务必帮助别人，该为了别人竭尽一切，并且随时随地照顾他们，却从不想到自己。据我推想这包括华珍小姐在内。我进了树林子里，在心里捉摸来，捉摸去，捉摸了好长一个时辰，可是我看不出这样捉摸有什么好处除了对别的人有好处这样，我想，我又何必为这个操心，还是随它去的好吧。有的时候，寡妇会把我叫去，把上帝讲得如何如何好，能让小孩子听了直流口水，可是到第二天，华珍小姐也许会抓住了你，把原先那一套打得粉碎。我便想，这样看来，会有两个上帝。要是能摊上寡妇说的那个上帝，就会有出头之日。不过，要是被华珍小姐的上帝管住了的话，那就什么都捞不到了。我想来想去，看来我还是归顺寡妇那个上帝划得来，只要他肯收我，尽管我不明白，他总能比他过去那么样的更好些，因为明摆着我那么笨，那么下贱，脾气又坏。'>查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Pap he hadn't been seen for more than a year, and that was comfortable for me; I didn't want to see him no more. He used to always whale me when he was sober and could get his hands on me; though I used to take to the woods most of the time when he was around. Well, about this time he was found in the river drownded, about twelve mile above town, so people said. They judged it was him, anyway; said this drownded man was just his size, and was ragged, and had uncommon long hair, which was all like pap; but they couldn't make nothing out of the face, because it had been in the water so long it warn't much like a face at all. They said he was floating on his back in the water. They took him and buried him on the bank. But I warn't comfortable long, because I happened to think of something. I knowed mighty well that a drownded man don't float on his back, but on his face. So I knowed, then, that this warn't pap, but a woman dressed up in a man's clothes. So I was uncomfortable again. I judged the old man would turn up again by and by, though I wished he wouldn't.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="至于我爸爸呢，我可有一年多没有见面了。这样，我也乐得能自在些，我根本不想再见到他。他不醉的时候，只要见我在一旁，总要揍我。而我呢，只要和他在一起，总是想溜进林子里去。记得有一回，人家说他在河里淹死了，说是在离镇上十几英里处。他们说，反正是他，没错。说淹死了的那个人，身材与它相似，穿着破旧的衣衫，头发长得出奇这一切正是我爸爸的模样因为泡在水里太久，不过从脸上就看不出来了，脸已模糊不清了。人家说，他身子漂在水面上。打捞上来后，就在河边埋葬了。不过我并没有能舒坦多久，因为我突然想到了一件事。我很清楚，淹死的人决不是脸朝天浮在水面上的，而是背朝天的。所以我就推断，那根本不是我的爸爸，而是一个穿了男人衣服的女子。这样，我就舒坦不起来了。我断定，尽管我不希望他会回来，但老头儿有一天总会出现，。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We played robber now and then about a month, and then I resigned. All the boys did. We hadn't robbed nobody, hadn't killed any people, but only just pretended. We used to hop out of the woods and go charging down on hog-drivers and women in carts taking garden stuff to market, but we never hived any of them. Tom Sawyer called the hogs "ingots," and he called the turnips and stuff "julery," and we would go to the cave and powwow over what we had done, and how many people we had killed and marked. But I couldn't see no profit in it. One time Tom sent a boy to run about town with a blazing stick, which he called a slogan (which was the sign for the Gang to get together), and then he said he had got secret news by his spies that next day a whole parcel of Spanish merchants and rich A-rabs was going to camp in Cave Hollow with two hundred elephants, and six hundred camels, and over a thousand "sumter" mules, all loaded down with di'monds, and they didn't have only a guard of four hundred soldiers, and so we would lay in ambuscade, as he called it, and kill the lot and scoop the things. He said we must slick up our swords and guns, and get ready. He never could go after even a turnip-cart but he must have the swords and guns all scoured up for it, though they was only lath and broomsticks, and you might scour at them till you rotted, and then they warn't worth a mouthful of ashes more than what they was before. I didn't believe we could lick such a crowd of Spaniards and A-rabs, but I wanted to see the camels and elephants, so I was on hand next day, Saturday, in the ambuscade; and when we got the word we rushed out of the woods and down the hill. But there warn't no Spaniards and A-rabs, and there warn't no camels nor no elephants. It warn't anything but a Sunday-school picnic, and only a primer-class at that. We busted it up, and chased the children up the hollow; but we never got anything but some doughnuts and jam, though Ben Rogers got a rag doll, and Jo Harper got a hymn-book and a tract; and then the teacher charged in, and made us drop everything and cut. I didn't see no di'monds, and I told Tom Sawyer so. He said there was loads of them there, anyway; and he said there was A-rabs there, too, and elephants and things. I said, why couldn't we see them, then? He said if I warn't so ignorant, but had read a book called Don Quixote, I would know without asking. He said it was all done by enchantment. He said there was hundreds of soldiers there, and elephants and treasure, and so on, but we had enemies which he called magicians; and they had turned the whole thing into an infant Sundayschool, just out of spite. I said, all right; then the thing for us to do was to go for the magicians. Tom Sawyer said I was a numskull.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title='如今有两个月光景，我们还是玩充当强盗那码子事儿。后来我退出不干了。哥儿们一个个全都退出了，我们并没有抢劫过什么人，也没有杀过什么人，不过是装成这模样罢了。我们总是从林子里跳将出来，冲向那些赶猪的人和那些赶着车把蔬菜运往菜市场去的妇女。不过我们从未将她们扣押过。汤姆·索亚把那些猪称做"金条"，把萝卜之类的东西，称做"珍宝"。我们回到山洞里去，吹嘘我们的功绩，吹我们杀了多少人，吹给多少人留下了伤疤。不过我看不出这一套有什么用处。有一次，汤姆派一个哥儿们，手里举着一根正燃着的火棍，到镇上跑了一圈。他把这火棍叫做信号（是通知全帮的哥儿们集合的）。接着，他说他获得了他派出去的密探所得的秘密情报：明天，有一大队西班牙商人和阿拉伯富翁要到"洼洞"那里宿夜，随身带有全装着珍珠宝贝的三百匹大象，八百匹骆驼和一千多头"驮骡"，他们的警卫仅有二百个人。因此，用他的话来说，我们不妨来一个突击，把这伙子人杀掉，把财宝抢过来。他说，我们需把刀枪擦亮，做好一切准备。他连一辆装萝卜的车子都应付不了，却非得把刀枪全都擦洗好，准备一切。其实那些不过是薄木片和扫帚把的刀枪，你再擦，擦得累死累活也不会亮，这些东西也不会变样，不过是一堆灰烬罢了。我就不相信我们能打垮这么一大群西班牙人和阿拉伯人。不过，我倒想见识见识那些骆驼啊，大象啊之类的。因此，第二天，星期日，我也参加了伏击，一得到消息，我们就冲出林子，冲下小山。不过没见西班牙人和阿拉伯人，没见骆驼，没见大象。只是主日学校举行的一次野餐，而且只是一年级学生参加。我们把他们冲散了，把小孩子们冲进了洼地。不过东西呢，我们除了一些甜面包。果子酱，什么也没有捞到。朋。罗杰斯总算捞到了一只破烂的洋娃娃，乔。哈贝搞到了一本赞美诗集和一本小册子。接着，他们的老师赶来了，我们只能把一切全扔掉，赶快逃走。我可没有见到什么钻石，我也对汤姆·索亚这么说了。他说，反正那里一批批有的是，他还说，那儿还有阿拉伯人哩，还有大象哩，还有其它好多。我问，怎么我看不见啊？他说，只要我不是这么笨，并且读过一本叫做《堂。吉诃德》的书，我便不会这么问了，就会懂得了。他说这是魔法搞的。他说，那儿有成千上万的士兵，有大象，有珍珠宝贝，如此等等，不一而足。不过，我们还有敌人，他把他们叫做魔法师，是他们，把整个儿这一切摇身一变，变成了主日学校，就只是为了存心捣乱。我说，既然这样，我们该干的就是要去寻找那些魔法师了。汤姆·索亚说我真是个笨脑壳。'>查看中文翻译</div>
