<div class="line_en">Her Dothraki called the sea the poison water, distrusting any liquid that their horses could not drink. On the day the three ships had lifted anchor at Qarth, you would have thought they were sailing to hell instead of Pentos. Her brave young bloodriders had stared off at the dwindling coastline with huge white eyes, each of the three determined to show no fear before the other two, while her handmaids Irri and Jhiqui clutched the rail desperately and retched over the side at every little swell. The rest of Dany's tiny khalasar remained below decks, preferring the company of their nervous horses to the terrifying landless world about the ships. When a sudden squall had enveloped them six days into the voyage, she heard them through the hatches; the horses kicking and screaming, the riders praying in thin quavery voices each time Balerion heaved or swayed.</div>

<div class="line_en">A cross the still blue water came the slow steady beat of drums and the soft swish of oars from the galleys. The great cog groaned in their wake, the heavy lines stretched taut between. Balerion's sails hung limp, drooping forlorn from the masts. Yet even so, as she stood upon the forecastle watching her dragons chase each other across a cloudless blue sky, Daenerys Targaryen was as happy as she could ever remember being.</div>

<div class="line_en">No squall could frighten Dany, though. Daenerys Stormborn, she was called, for she had come howling into the world on distant Dragonstone as the greatest storm in the memory of Westeros howled outside, a storm so fierce that it ripped gargoyles from the castle walls and smashed her father's fleet to kindling.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但没有风暴可以吓倒丹妮，她的称号便是“风暴降生”。当年，她在遥远的龙石岛哭号着出世时，维斯特洛历史上最大的一场暴风雨也于同时在海上呼啸。风暴如此狂烈，甚至刮裂城墙上的石像鬼，并将她父亲的舰队摧毁殆尽。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The narrow sea was often stormy, and Dany had crossed it half a hundred times as a girl, running from one Free City to the next half a step ahead of the Usurper's hired knives. She loved the sea. She liked the sharp salty smell of the air, and the vastness of horizons bounded only by a vault of azure sky above. It made her feel small, but free as well. She liked the dolphins that sometimes swam along beside Balerion, slicing through the waves like silvery spears, and the flying fish they glimpsed now and again. She even liked the sailors, with all their songs and stories. Once on a voyage to Braavos, as she'd watched the crew wrestle down a great green sail in a rising gale, she had even thought how fine it would be to be a sailor. But when she told her brother, Viserys had twisted her hair until she cried. "You are blood of the dragon," he had screamed at her. "A dragon, not some smelly fish."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="狭海上时有风暴，丹妮在孩童时代便穿越过几十次，从一个自由贸易城邦逃到另一个自由贸易城邦，仅仅领先篡夺者的刺客一步之遥。在这个过程中，她喜欢上了海洋。她喜欢空气里刺鼻的咸味，喜欢苍穹覆盖下的无垠海面。这虽然让她自觉渺小，却也感到自由。她喜欢此刻跟着贝勒里恩号游泳的海豚，如银色标枪一般穿透波浪，她还喜欢不时瞥见的飞鱼。她甚至喜欢水手，喜欢他们的歌谣与故事。有一回，在航向布拉佛斯途中，当她注视着船员们顶风使劲拽下一面巨大的绿色船帆时，竟突发奇想地认为，成为一名水手该有多好。她把想法告诉哥哥，却被韦赛里斯狠狠揪住头发，大哭一场。“你是真龙血脉，”他朝她嘶喊，“真龙，不是臭烘烘的鱼。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Just so, Captain," she answered with a smile, pleased to have won the man over. Captain Groleo was an old Pentoshi like his master, Illyrio Mopatis, and he had been nervous as a maiden about carrying three dragons on his ship. Half a hundred buckets of seawater still hung from the gunwales, in case of fires. At first Groleo had wanted the dragons caged and Dany had consented to put his fears at ease, but their misery was so palpable that she soon changed her mind and insisted they be freed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“就是这样，船长，”丹妮微笑作答。她很高兴在短时间内把这个人争取了过来。格罗莱船长和他的主子伊利里欧？摩帕提斯一样，是个老潘托斯，用自己的船搭三头龙令他紧张得像个少女——就连现在船舷外仍挂着数十桶海水，以防万一着火。起初，格罗莱想把龙关进笼子，为安抚他，丹妮答应下来，但龙的可怜模样让她很快改变了主意，坚持放他们自由。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The captain appeared at her elbow. "Would that this Balerion could soar as her namesake did, Your Grace," he said in bastard Valyrian heavily flavored with accents of Pentos. "Then we should not need to row, nor tow, nor pray for wind."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="船长走到她身边，“若是贝勒里恩号能象与她同名的龙一样腾空飞翔，陛下，”他用杂着浓重潘托斯口音的瓦雷利亚语说，“我们就无需划桨，无需牵引，也无需祈祷起风了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was a fool about that, and so much else, Dany thought. If he had been wiser and more patient, it would be him sailing west to take the throne that was his by rights. Viserys had been stupid and vicious, she had come to realize, yet sometimes she missed him all the same. Not the cruel weak man he had become by the end, but the brother who had sometimes let her creep into his bed, the boy who told her tales of the Seven Kingdoms, and talked of how much better their lives would be once he claimed his crown.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他是个傻瓜，大傻瓜，丹妮心想，如果他更理智，更有耐心，那么此刻航向西方以取回王座的应该是他而不是我。虽然她明白韦赛里斯既愚蠢又恶毒，但有时候，还是忍不住想念他——不是想念那个残酷而软弱的牺牲品，而是想念那个童年时代准她爬上他床的哥哥，那个常给她讲述七大王国故事的男孩，那个为她描绘登上王位以后美好生活的国王。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Viserion's scales were the color of fresh cream, his horns, wing bones, and spinal crest a dark gold that flashed bright as metal in the sun. Rhaegal was made of the green of summer and the bronze of fall. They soared above the ships in wide circles, higher and higher, each trying to climb above the other.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="韦赛利昂的鳞片是新鲜的乳白色，他的角、翅骨和脊骨则是暗金色，好似阳光下闪亮的金属。雷哥则由夏天的碧绿和秋天的青铜色构成。他俩在船队上方翱翔，一圈一圈地盘旋，越升越高，竞相攀比。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Even Captain Groleo was glad of that, now. There had been one small fire, easily extinguished; against that, Balerion suddenly seemed to have far fewer rats than she'd had before, when she sailed under the name Saduleon. And her crew, once as fearful as they were curious, had begun to take a queer fierce pride in "their" dragons. Every man of them, from captain to cook's boy, loved to watch the three fly… though none so much as Dany.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="格罗莱船长从这个安排中得到了好处，虽然有过一场微不足道的小火，但比起从前以赛杜里昂号之名航行的时代，贝勒里恩号上突然少了许多老鼠。她的船员们曾经既好奇又害怕，而今却开始对“他们”的龙油然生出古怪而强烈的骄傲，从船长到帮厨小弟，都喜欢看他们三个飞翔…尽管没有丹妮那么强烈。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dragons always preferred to attack from above, Dany had learned. Should either get between the other and the sun, he would fold his wings and dive screaming, and they would tumble from the sky locked together in a tangled scaly ball, jaws snapping and tails lashing. The first time they had done it, she feared that they meant to kill each other, but it was only sport. No sooner would they splash into the sea than they would break apart and rise again, shrieking and hissing, the salt water steaming off them as their wings clawed at the air. Drogon was aloft as well, though not in sight; he would be miles ahead, or miles behind, hunting.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="龙喜欢从高处攻击，丹妮已经知道，爬到对手与太阳之间，就会折起翅膀，尖啸着俯冲而下。接着他俩会互相扣住，纠缠成一团鳞甲的球，一边自天空翻滚下落，一边舞爪甩尾。他们第一次争斗时，她好怕会伤到彼此，结果证明这对他们而言只算活动筋骨。等降到海面，两条龙即刻分离，咝咝尖叫着再度升起，舞动翅膀挥开蒸腾的海水。卓耿也在飞，但早已飞出她的视线范围。他常到远方去捕猎，离船有好多里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But that time was not yet come. Rhaegal and Viserion were the size of small dogs, Drogon only a little larger, and any dog would have outweighed them; they were all wings and neck and tail, lighter than they looked. And so Daenerys Targaryen must rely on wood and wind and canvas to bear her home.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但那个时候还没有到来。再说，雷哥和韦赛利昂还只有小狗的体型，卓耿虽比他们大一些，但任何一条狗都比他们重——因为龙的身躯基本由颈项、尾巴和翅膀组成，比看上去要轻。丹妮莉丝？坦格利安要回家还得靠木头、帆布和风。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The wood and the canvas had served her well enough so far, but the fickle wind had turned traitor. For six days and six nights they had been becalmed, and now a seventh day had come, and still no breath of air to fill their sails. Fortunately, two of the ships that Magister Illyrio had sent after her were trading galleys, with two hundred oars apiece and crews of strong-armed oarsmen to row them. But the great cog Balerion was a song of a different key; a ponderous broad-beamed sow of a ship with immense holds and huge sails, but helpless in a calm. Vhagar and Meraxes had let out lines to tow her, but it made for painfully slow going. All three ships were crowded, and heavily laden.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迄今为止，前两者均为她提供了优良服务，变幻无常的风却成为叛徒。六天六夜，海面波澜不惊，而今已是第七天，依然没有好转的迹象。惟一值得庆幸的是，伊利里欧总督派给她的船中有两艘是划桨商船，各有两百支桨，并配备了精壮水手。难在大商船贝勒里恩号，她象肥母猪般笨重宽阔，体积大，帆也大，可没桨，无风的时候半点动弹不了。瓦格哈尔号和米拉西斯号放出绳索拖拽，她缓慢而痛苦地前进着，三艘船上都挤满人和各种商品。">查看中文翻译</div>

Bolder than the other two, her black dragon had been the first to try his wings above the water, the first to flutter from ship to ship, the first to lose himself in a passing cloud… and the first to kill. The flying fish no sooner broke the surface of the water than they were enveloped in a lance of flame, snatched up, and swallowed. "How big will he grow?" Dany asked curiously. "Do you know?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"In King's Landing, your ancestors raised an immense domed castle for their dragons. The Dragonpit, it is called. It still stands atop the Hill of Rhaenys, though all in ruins now. That was where the royal dragons dwelt in days of yore, and a cavernous dwelling it was, with iron doors so wide that thirty knights could ride through them abreast. Yet even so, it was noted that none of the pit dragons ever reached the size of their ancestors. The maesters say it was because of the walls around them, and the great dome above their heads."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“在君临，您的先祖为他们的龙盖了一栋圆顶巨堡，称为‘龙穴’，迄今仍矗立在雷尼丝丘陵顶，只是早成废墟。昔日，王室的龙就在那居住，好像一个大洞穴，外面有非常宽阔的铁门，里面可容三十个骑士骑马并肩通过。即便如此，龙穴里的龙却从没长到他们祖先的大小。学士们都说，这是墙和圆顶的关系。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The squire Whitebeard, standing by the figurehead with one lean hand curled about his tall hardwood staff, turned toward them and said, "Balerion the Black Dread was two hundred years old when he died during the reign of jaehaerys the Conciliator. He was so large he could swallow an aurochs whole. A dragon never stops growing, Your Grace, so long as he has food and freedom." His name was Arstan, but Strong Belwas had named him Whitebeard for his pale whiskers, and most everyone called him that now. He was taller than Ser Jorah, though not so muscular; his eyes were a pale blue, his long beard as white as snow and as flne as silk.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ser Jorah shrugged. "A dragon's natural span of days is many times as long as a man's, or so the songs would have us believe… but the dragons the Seven Kingdoms knew best were those of House Targaryen. They were bred for war, and in war they died. It is no easy thing to slay a dragon, but it can be done."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="乔拉爵士耸耸肩，“龙的天然寿命比人长得多，至少歌谣里这么讲…七大王国的人民最熟悉的龙是坦格利安家族的龙。他们为战争而繁殖，也在战争中死去。屠龙很难，但并非不可企及。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"King," Dany corrected. "He was a king, though he never reigned. Viserys, the Third of His Name. But what do you mean?" His answer had not been one that she'd expected.

<div class="line_cn" title="“他是国王，”丹妮纠正，“虽未经加冕，但依旧是七国之君，韦赛里斯三世。好啦，你刚才什么意思？”他的回答并不如她预期。“乔拉爵士曾说我哥雷加是最后的真龙传人，我以为他定是个非常厉害的战士，对吧？”">查看中文翻译</div>

He was reading so early that men said Queen Rhaella must have swallowed some books and a candle whilst he was in her womb. Rhaegar took no interest in the play of other children. The maesters were awed by his wits, but his father's knights would jest sourly that Baelor the Blessed had been born again. Until one day Prince Rhaegar found something in his scrolls that changed him. No one knows what it might have been, only that the boy suddenly appeared early one morning in the yard as the knights were donning their steel. He walked up to Ser Willem Darry, the master-at-arms, and said, 'I will require sword and armor. It seems I must be a warrior."'</div>

<div class="line_en">Dany glanced aft. The eunuch was climbing through the hold amidships, nimble for all his size. Belwas was squat but broad, a good fifteen stone of fat and muscle, his great brown gut crisscrossed by faded white scars. He wore baggy pants, a yellow silk bellyband, and an absurdly tiny leather vest dotted with iron studs. "Strong Belwas is hungry!" he roared at everyone and no one in particular. "Strong Belwas will eat now!" Turning, he spied Arstan on the forecastle. "Whitebeard! You will bring food for Strong Belwas!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="丹妮回头扫了一眼。太监正通过船中间的扶手爬上甲板，他体格虽庞大，动作却极灵敏。贝沃斯人不高，但胸膛宽阔，估计体重超过十五石，厚实的棕色肚子上横七竖八地满是淡白的旧疤痕。他穿着松垮的短裤，系一条黄丝肚兜，镶铁钉的皮背心则小得有些可笑。“壮汉贝沃斯饿了！”他朝所有人吼叫，“壮汉贝沃斯要吃东西！”他转身发现前甲板上的阿斯坦，“白胡子！你给壮汉贝沃斯拿吃的来！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">That does seem queer, Dany had to admit. Strong Belwas was an ex-slave, bred and trained in the fighting pits of Meereen. Magister Illyrio had sent him to guard her, or so Belwas claimed, and it was true that she needed guarding. The Usurper on his Iron Throne had offered land and lordship to any man who killed her. One attempt had been made already, with a cup of poisoned wine. The closer she came to Westeros, the more likely another attack became. Back in Qarth, the warlock Pyat Pree had sent a Sorrowful Man after her to avenge the Undying she'd burned in their House of Dust. Warlocks never forgot a wrong, it was said, and the Sorrowful Men never failed to kill. Most of the Dothraki would be against her as well. Khal Drogo's kos led khalasars of their own now, and none of them would hesitate to attack her own little band on sight, to slay and slave her people and drag Dany herself back to Vaes Dothrak to take her proper place among the withered crones of the dosh khaleen. She hoped that Xaro Xhoan Daxos was not an enemy, but the Qartheen merchant had coveted her dragons. And there was Quaithe of the Shadow, that strange woman in the red lacquer mask with all her cryptic counsel. Was she an enemy too, or only a dangerous friend? Dany could not say.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="确实古怪，丹妮不得不承认。壮汉贝沃斯从前是个奴隶，在弥林的斗技场中长大受训。他声称伊利里欧总督派他来保护她，而她也确实需要保护。铁王座上的篡夺者用领地和爵位来招募杀手，有一次暗杀就在她眼皮底下发生。而今她越接近维斯特洛，想必遭到攻击的可能性将越来越大。另一方面，不待离开魁尔斯，男巫俳雅·菩厉便派出遗憾客，来为尘埃之殿中被她烧毁的不朽之人复仇，据说，男巫有仇必报，而遗憾客决不失手。此外，大多数多斯拉克人也与她对立。昔日卓戈卡奥的寇们都有了自己的卡拉萨，一旦发现她这小队人马，必定会毫不犹豫地加以攻击，屠杀和奴役她的子民，并把丹妮本人带回维斯·多斯拉克，逼她加入多希卡林的枯瘦老妪们。札罗·赞旺·达梭斯帮过她，但魁尔斯巨商的目的只是她的龙。还有阴影之地的魁晰，戴红漆面具的神秘女子，以及她深奥莫测的忠告。她也是敌人吗？还是危险的朋友？丹妮说不上来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"A queen must listen to all," she reminded him. "The highborn and the low, the strong and the weak, the noble and the venal. One voice may speak you false, but in many there is always truth to be found." She had read that in a book.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“女王须要聆听所有人的话，”她提醒他，“尊贵的人与低贱的人，强壮的人与弱小的人，高尚的人与堕落的人。一个人的声音也许会欺骗你，但综合许多人的意见才能得到真相。”这是她从书中读来的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ser forah saved me from the poisoner, and Arstan Whitebeard from the manticore. Perhaps Strong Belwas voll save me from the next. He was huge enough, with arms like small trees and a great curved arakh so sharp he might have shaved with it, in the unlikely event of hair sprouting on those smooth brown cheeks. Yet he was childlike as well. As a protector, he leaves much to be desired. Thankfully, I have Ser forah and my bloodriders. And my dragons, never forget. In time, the dragons would be her most formidable guardians, just as they had been for Aegon the Conqueror and his sisters three hundred years ago. just now, though, they brought her more danger than protection.

I am still half a world from Westeros, Dany reminded herself, but every hour brings me closer.

<div class="line_en">"Your Grace," he conceded, "the dragon has three heads, remember? You have wondered at that, ever since you heard it from the warlocks in the House of Dust. Well, here's your meaning: Balerion, Meraxes, and Vhagar, ridden by Aegon, Rhaenys, and Visenya. The three-headed dragon of House Targaryen -- three dragons, and three riders."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“陛下，”他让步了，“龙有三个头，记得这句话吧？从尘埃之殿中听来之后，你一直深感疑惑。好吧，我告诉你：从前有贝勒里恩，米拉西斯和瓦格哈尔三条巨龙，分别由伊耿，雷妮丝和维桑尼亚骑乘。坦格利安家族的纹章是三头龙——实际上，是三条龙，三个骑手。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Rhaenys and Visenya were Aegon's wives as well as his sisters. You have no brothers, but you can take husbands. And I tell you truly, Daenerys, there is no man in all the world who will ever be half so true to you as me."</div>
