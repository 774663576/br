<div class="line_en">I found a few of my aunts in their fashionable outfits by an old Cadillac pretending to drink whisky. Many of the photographs were taken in Coney Island and Cape Cod. I especially love the photographs of the bathing beauties and their swimsuits. The suits are quite modest by today's standards but the young women didn't seem to care. They were staying at such places as Newport Beach and Cape Cod having the time of their lives running in and out of the tide. One photograph had a vendor selling dogs by a coaster at Coney Island -- a younger picture of my mother with her brown hair and blue eyes eager to go on board with my Dad. He looked a bit frightened in the picture as I could see he was holding on tightly to the bar to the coaster, his black hair flying in the breeze. I smile when I look at that picture because it is hard to imagine anyone's Dad ever being a kid. He looked like he was having a great time probably because he was with my mother. She is smiling in the picture and wearing a white blouse, blue shorts and tennis shoes. She is quite a looker, I can see why my Dad liked her so much.</div>

<div class="line_en">I love to look at old photographs in the album. My father had a big box of pictures in the cabinet and some of the pictures go way back to the 1890's. The women dressed with such dignity and had style back then. My Dad would linger around his precious box of photographs and tell me stories about each photo and every one. It was one of those moments that you could not really appreciate when you were young. It is only after he was long gone that I can look back and say thanks for taking the time to show me a tiny window into the world of people who really did know how to live.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我喜欢看相册里的老照片。我父亲的橱柜里有一大箱子的照片，其中一些可以追溯到19世纪90年代。那时的女人们穿着很有尊严，很有风度。我爸爸会在他珍贵的照片盒周围徘徊，给我讲述每一张照片和每一张照片的故事。这是你年轻时无法真正感激的时刻之一。只有在他去世很久之后，我才能回首往事，感谢他花时间向我展示了一扇小小的窗户，让我看到那些真正懂得如何生活的人的世界。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I dig down to the bottom of the box and see two large photographs. One is dated 1900 and the other one is dated 1997 -- a recent picture that looks similar to the older one. The older picture looks familiar because it is taken in the same place -- the summer home.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我挖到箱子的底部，看到两张大照片。一张日期是1900年，另一张日期是1997年——这是一张近期的照片，看起来与上一张相似。这张老照片看起来很眼熟，因为它是在同一个地方拍摄的——避暑别墅。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I will describe the older photograph as very interesting in the style of dress and exactly where the people are sitting. They are posed outside the cottage by a small tree that is still there today. A woman is sitting in a rocking chair, with here black hair pulled up in a bun. She is not smiling but looking away from the camera and wearing a long black dress. Another woman is wearing a white blouse with a necktie and a long black skirt. Her hair is also long and blonder but pulled back in a bun. There are two men on either side of a wooden table. Both men appear older and are dressed in hats and suits and ties, trousers and Sunday shoes. Neither is smiling. (I have the distinct feeling that the women are their wives and it is Sunday.) They probably are hungry for their roast beef and potatoes, but that is just my guess. There is a young boy, probably about 13 in the photograph. He is wearing a white blouse, black shorts, long black socks and tan sports shoes. He is petting a black dog that is sitting on top of the round wooden table. The boy is bending down and he isn't smiling either. It must have been hot outside and he probably wants to go for a swim with the dog. The water is just below them and he is probably wondering why he has to take this stupid picture all dressed up on a Sunday.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我认为这张老照片的服装风格非常有趣，而且人们坐的地方也很精确。他们在小屋外面的一棵小树旁摆好姿势，这棵树至今还在那里。一个女人坐在摇椅上，黑色的头发挽成一个发髻。她没有笑，而是转过头去，穿着一件黑色长裙。另一个女人穿着白色衬衫，打着领带和黑色长裙。她的头发也很长，金黄色，但挽成一个发髻。在一张木桌的两边各坐着两个人。两人看上去都比实际年龄大，都穿着帽子、西装、领带、裤子和礼拜天穿的鞋子。微笑也不是。（我有一种明显的感觉，那些女人是她们的妻子，今天是星期天。）他们可能很想吃烤牛肉和土豆，但这只是我的猜测。有一个小男孩，照片里大概有13岁。他身穿白色上衣、黑色短裤、黑色长袜和棕色运动鞋。他抚摸着一只坐在圆木桌子上的黑狗。男孩弯下腰，也没有微笑。外面一定很热，他可能想和狗一起去游泳。水就在他们下面，他可能想知道为什么他要在星期天盛装拍这张愚蠢的照片。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I notice that the color of my cabin was quite different in 1900 and it was much smaller. The color was green, with white railings around the porch and steps leading down to the patio. That is where the picture of this Smart Family was taken. The family appears rather stiff in the photo but I am sure that they had a good laugh after the Sunday dinner was served.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我注意到我的小屋在1900年的时候颜色很不一样，而且要小得多。颜色是绿色的，白色的栏杆围绕着门廊和通往天井的台阶。这就是这张聪明一家的照片拍摄的地方。这家人在照片中显得相当生硬，但是我相信他们在星期天的晚餐之后一定笑得很开心。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The second larger photograph is of my own family about 1997. It is also in black and white. We didn't wear any older clothes but used our own clothes. The tree in the background has grown to enormous heights and is still standing. The steps leading down to Mousam Lake have cracked and are in awful need of repair. Believe it or not, we still own the old wooden table and all of the rocking chairs owned by the Smart Family. I did a search of the Smart Family and they were originally from Portsmouth. At least five other families owned my cottage before my father bought it in 1950 for three thousand dollars. The cottage comes with thirteen acres of land that I still own along with my seven brothers and sisters. It was passed on to me when my mother died. We have formed the Camp Fund to pay the taxes and preserve our legacy. It is a beautiful cabin on a prime spot on Mousam Lake. I was not here when this photo was taken and it hangs in the living room of the cabin. Many visitors comment on it and think it is quite amazing to have a house for so long.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二张较大的照片是我自己的家庭，大约在1997年。它也是黑白的。我们没有穿旧衣服，而是穿自己的衣服。背景中的那棵树已经长到了极高的高度，至今仍然屹立不倒。通往穆萨姆湖的台阶裂开了，急需修复。信不信由你，我们仍然拥有旧木桌和所有的摇椅属于斯玛特家族。我搜索了一下“聪明家庭”，它们最初来自朴茨茅斯。在我父亲1950年花3000美元买下我的小屋之前，至少还有五户人家拥有它。这个小屋有十三英亩的土地。我和我的七个兄弟姐妹仍然拥有它。我母亲去世的时候，它就传给了我。我们成立了营地基金，以支付税款和保存我们的遗产。这是一个漂亮的小木屋，坐落在穆萨姆湖的黄金地段。这张照片拍摄的时候我不在，它就挂在客厅里。许多游客评论它，认为它是相当惊人的有一个房子这么长的时间。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">All of these photographs remind me that people are not so very different. We all want to enjoy living and be together as a family. The time that families spend together is very valuable. The children will always remember the little things that their parents do for them. For me it was my Dad that showed me these pictures and took the time to tell me the stories behind each of them. I thank him dearly for that.</div>

<div class="line_en">The history of the house is interesting to view from photographs. Around the table are my brother Bob just wearing a casual shirt and shorts (smiling), Annie wearing a T- Shirt and shorts. Mike wearing a white shirt and long nylon trousers not smiling, Mary, whom I couldn't tell what she was wearing, my Mom, her white hair and her beautiful blue eyes and smile, was wearing a peach blouse and slacks, my Dad wasn't alive for this photo, he died in 1986.
