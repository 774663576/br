<div class="line_en">The news spread fast all round the city, and most of the clergy were gathering in the cathedral library. This was a large room which was attached to the dean's house -- a convenient place to wait for information about his state of health. It appeared that the old man had suddenly fallen ill, and was close to death. The great London doctor, Sir Omicron Pie, had been sent for, but meanwhile the Barchester doctors were doing their best.</div>

<div class="line_en">The bishop was sitting in his study at the palace when he heard the news of the dean's illness. Dr Proudie was not feeling well himself. It was only yesterday that he had won his first battle against Mrs Proudie, and had thought his slavery might be at an end. He had spent a happy evening with Mr Slope, planning many things in his new-found freedom, but as the bed-time hour approached, his heart sank within him. Could he trust himself to come down to breakfast a free man? Unwillingly he climbed upstairs, an hour later than usual, to the room he shared with his lady wife. What passed between them that night cannot be easily described. It is enough to say that he came down the following morning a sad and thoughtful man, looking thinner, older and greyer than before. All ambition was now dead within him.</div>

<div class="line_en">When Mr Slope heard the news, it occurred to him that he himself might be the new dean. He too wondered if the income would be twelve hundred, fifteen hundred, or two thousand, but in any case it would be a great step forward for him -- he would have more power than the archdeacon.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="听说教士长病重的时候，斯洛普先生突然想到，自己也许可以成为新任教士长。他也想知道，教士长的年薪究竟是一千二、一千五还是两千，不过无论如何，这对他来说都是往前迈了一大步——他的权力将超过执事长。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He began to make his plans. First, he was sure he could rely on the bishop's support -- the prime minister might ask Dr Proudie's advice on who should fill the vacancy. Secondly, he knew a gentleman, Sir Nicholas Fitzwhiggin, who was an inspector of schools, and who had many friends in the government -- he hoped Sir Nicholas would use his personal contacts to help him. And finally, he flattered himself that he had a useful friend in Mr Towers, a journalist on The Jupiter, who would be able to put forward the name of Slope in the newspaper's columns.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是他开始制订计划。首先，他肯定自己能够得到主教的支持——在该由谁来填补空缺这个问题上，首相可能会征询普劳蒂博士的意见。其次，他认识尼古拉斯·菲茨维金爵士，他是督学，在政府里有很多朋友——他希望尼古拉斯爵士会动用自己的人脉来帮他。最后，他自以为《朱庇特报》的记者——托尔斯先生——是他能派上用场的朋友，能把斯洛普的名字写进这份报纸的专栏。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The dean was still alive, but Mr Slope did not want to waste any time. So he went straight to the bishop's study, knowing that Dr Proudie was to set out the next day for the archbishop's palace. The bishop was sitting in his chair, doing nothing and thinking of nothing, as Mr Slope entered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="教士长还活着，但斯洛普先生不想浪费一分一秒。于是他径直去了主教的书房，知道普劳蒂博士第二天就要启程前往大主教的宅邸。斯洛普先生走进去的时候，主教坐在椅子上，无所事事，什么都不想。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This was a slight shock to Mr Slope, who, however, recovered quickly. His difficulty was how to make his speech sound modest enough. "Perhaps I can help you there, my lord. I have been considering the matter for some time, and if poor Dr Trefoil must go, I do not see why, with your lordship's assistance, I should not hold the post myself."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这句话让斯洛普先生小小地吃了一惊，但他很快就缓过神来。眼下他的困难就是如何让自己的话显得足够谦逊。“这我兴许能帮到您，大人。这件事我已经考虑了一段时间，要是可怜的特雷弗尔博士一定会离我们而去，据我看，有了大人您的支持，我本人没理由不能接掌这个职位。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You!" cried the bishop, in a far from flattering manner.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你！”主教大喊一声，语气绝无半点恭维。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The ice was now broken, and Mr Slope began to speak smoothly and persuasively. He talked of his achievements so far, his work for the Church, his friends in high places, and his great respect and admiration for Dr Proudie. He described the ways he, as dean, could add to Dr Proudie's comfort in Barchester and influence over the clergy. Then, without pausing, he produced another seven or eight reasons why no one on earth could make such a good Dean of Barchester as himself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="既然话已说破，斯洛普先生便开始滔滔不绝地劝说主教。他谈到了自己目前的成就、为教会所做的工作、几个身居高位的朋友以及他对普劳蒂博士的高度尊重和景仰。他还说，当上教士长之后，他就可以让普劳蒂博士在巴彻斯特过得更舒适，提高博士在神职人员中的影响力。紧接着，他一口气又列出了七八条理由，说明为什么巴彻斯特教士长一职非他莫属。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So, in the end, the bishop approved of Mr Slope's suggestion, and it was decided that he would mention it to the archbishop as soon as the occasion presented itself. But Dr Proudie wanted something from his chaplain in return. "About Hiram's Hospital," he said. "I think, on the whole, it will be better to let Mr Quiverful have it. He has a large family, and is very poor."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是，主教最终同意了斯洛普先生的建议，决定一有机会就跟大主教提这件事情。不过，普劳蒂博士也想从自己的特遣牧师那里得到一点回报。“至于海勒姆养老院，”他说，“我觉得，总体上讲，还是交给奎沃夫先生比较好。他家里人口多，又很穷。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The bishop sat there, speechless. He would never have imagined Mr Slope as Dean of Barchester, but little by little he began to see there would be advantages for himself in this promotion. He could well do without Mr Slope, who was no longer useful to him in his war against Mrs Proudie; in this war the bishop had now admitted defeat. If, indeed, he could have slept in his chaplain's bedroom instead of his wife's, there might have been some reason to keep Mr Slope.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="主教坐在那儿，一言不发。他做梦也想不到斯洛普先生会是巴彻斯特的教士长，却还是慢慢意识到，这样的提拔对他自己也不无裨益。他离了斯洛普先生也好好的。在反抗普劳蒂太太的斗争中，斯洛普先生对他已经不再有什么用处，因为他已经认输。说真的，要是能睡在自己的特遣牧师的卧室里，而不是妻子的卧室，那他或许还有点理由来留住斯洛普先生。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And so they parted. Mr Slope now had much business on his hands. He had to make his daily visit to the signora. It would have been wiser not to do this, but passion had made him blind. He decided he would take tea at the Stanhopes' just this once, and then go there no more. He also had to arrange matters with Mrs Bold. She would make as charming a dean's wife as a chaplain's, and her fortune would be a useful addition if the dean's income was found to be only twelve hundred.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他俩就此作别。斯洛普先生手上的事情一下子多了起来。他每天都得去拜访内罗尼太太。其实不去更为明智，但激情已经蒙蔽了他的双眼。他决定再去斯坦诺普家喝一次茶，就这一次，以后就再也不去了。除此之外，他还得料理博尔德太太那边的事情。做特遣牧师的妻子也好，教士长的妻子也罢，她都会十分迷人。更何况，要是最后发现教士长的年薪只有一千二的话，她的财富将是有益的补充。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mr Slope, along with many others, thought that all was fair in love and war. So he had not considered it dishonourable to bribe and flatter Eleanor's young maid, in order to get information from her about the widow. In this way he had heard about the arrival of his letter at Plumstead and the arguments which had followed; to his delight, the maid thought she had heard Mrs Bold declare that she "wouldn't give up Mr Slope for anybody". This made the chaplain feel quite certain that the beautiful widow would now, in all probability, accept his offer. He must, therefore, make his declaration very soon, before it was known that Mr Quiverful, not Mr Harding, was to have the wardenship.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="跟许多人一样，斯洛普先生也认为，在爱情和战争中，一切手段都是光明正大的。既然如此，他收买和讨好埃莉诺的年轻女仆，以便打探这位寡妇的消息，心里也不会觉得有什么不光彩。就是通过这种方法，他知道自己的信送到了普拉姆斯特德，也听说了之后的争执。让他高兴的是，女仆觉得自己听见了博尔德太太宣称，她“不会为了任何人而放弃斯洛普先生”。这位特遣牧师由此十分肯定，这个美貌的寡妇如今很有可能接受他的求婚。所以，在大家知道新任院长是奎沃夫先生而不是哈丁先生之前，他必须马上表明心迹。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">During the next week, Mrs Bold spent a great deal of time with the Stanhopes, of whom she became fonder and fonder. If asked, she would have said Charlotte was her special friend, but she liked Bertie nearly as much. She allowed him a kind of familiarity which she had never known with anyone else, and which she did not realize could be dangerous. In all this she was perfectly innocent, having no idea of him as a lover. But every familiarity into which Eleanor was trapped was deliberately planned by Charlotte. The sister knew well how to play her game, and played it without mercy; she knew her brother's character, and yet she would have handed over to him the young widow, and the young widow's money, without pity or regret. In order to do this Charlotte made her family and her father's house very welcoming to Mrs Bold. There was a lack of formality about them all which Eleanor found refreshing, after the priestly pride and stiffness she had recently had to put up with.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接下来那一周，博尔德太太跟斯坦诺普一家待了不少时间，心里也越来越喜欢这家人。如果有人问起来，她会说夏洛特是她特别的朋友，但她也同样喜欢伯蒂。她让伯蒂跟自己亲密到与别人从未有过的程度，并没有意识到这样可能会很危险。在整件事上，她的想法十分单纯，从没把他当作恋人。但埃莉诺身陷其中的熟稔关系全都是出自夏洛特的刻意安排。这个做姐姐的很清楚该如何玩这场游戏，玩起来也毫不手软。她了解弟弟的品性，却仍然打算把这个年轻寡妇连人带钱全部交给他，心里没有一丝怜悯和懊悔。为了达到目的，夏洛特让家人友好对待博尔德太太，也使博尔德太太在她父亲家里有宾至如归之感。刚刚忍受了神职人员的高傲和刻板，埃莉诺发现，这家人的不拘小节让她耳目一新。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="园会的前一天，主教才从大主教家回到巴彻斯特。到了之后，他心惊胆战地溜进了自己的宅邸，因为他比原计划多待了三天，很害怕因此受罚。然而，他受到的欢迎简直是再热烈不过。女儿们亲他，太太伸开双臂拥抱他，管他叫她的心肝宝贝、亲爱的、乖乖的小主教。这可真叫人喜出望外。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh yes, my dear. The archbishop was quite polite to me."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“听你这么说，我真高兴。”接下来，她话锋一转，“对了，可怜的教士长还活着呢。在大主教宅邸的时候，你们讨论过这件事情吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“讨论什么事情？”主教问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I? Oh, I just said -- I thought -- that is, if the dean --" As he searched for the right words, he saw his wife looking sternly at him, and he began to wonder. Why should he suffer so much to assist a man like Slope? Why fight a losing battle for a chaplain? From that moment he decided to give up his support for Slope, and try to gain his wife's approval in everything he did.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我？哦，我只是说——我觉得——我是说，要是教士长——”他搜肠刮肚寻找合适的话时，看见妻子恶狠狠地盯着自己，心里就犯了嘀咕。他为什么要吃苦受罪地帮斯洛普这样的人呢？为什么要为了一个特遣牧师打一场必败无疑的仗呢？就从这一刻起，他决定不再支持斯洛普，以后不管做什么事，都要尽量让妻子满意。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“找人接替教士长。”普劳蒂太太说。说这话的时候，她的眼睛里闪出从前那种熟悉的光芒，主教开始有点坐立不安。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“是的——没错，我觉得他确实有这个想法。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The bishop said nothing further to excuse himself or his chaplain, and he and his wife went in to dinner. That evening was the pleasantest he had spent in his own house for a long time. And in the morning, when he was dressing for the Ullathorne party, he promised himself he would never again go into battle against a fighter so skilled and so deadly as Mrs Proudie.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="主教没有再为自己或是自己的特遣牧师开脱，和妻子进餐厅吃晚饭去了。那天晚上是他好久以来在自己家度过的最美好的夜晚。第二天早晨，他一边为乌拉索恩的园会穿衣打扮，一边暗自发誓，绝不再跟自家太太这样一位技巧纯熟、手法致命的斗士交战。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mrs Proudie laughed a loud, scornful laugh. "Of course he'll stop being your chaplain! I couldn't for a moment think of living in the same house as such a man. But he won't become dean, oh no! I have my eye on him. It wasn't enough for him to interfere in cathedral business, to get you, my dear, into trouble and cause quarrelling among the clergy, no, that wasn't enough for him! He is now behaving in a most disgraceful way with that Italian woman. I shall show Mr Slope to the world for what he is -- a false, mean, wicked man. Dean, indeed! The man has gone mad!"</div>
