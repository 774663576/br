<div class="line_en">Next you ascended one flight of stairs and looked at the second- floor-back at $8. Convinced by her second-floor manner that it was worth the $12 that Mr. Toosenberry always paid for it until he left to take charge of his brother's orange plantation in Florida near Palm Beach, where Mrs. McIntyre always spent the winters that had the double front room with private bath, you managed to babble that you wanted something still cheaper.</div>

<div class="line_en">First Mrs. Parker would show you the double parlours. You would not dare to interrupt her description of their advantages and of the merits of the gentleman who had occupied them for eight years. Then you would manage to stammer forth the confession that you were neither a doctor nor a dentist. Mrs. Parker's manner of receiving the admission was such that you could never afterward entertain the same feeling toward your parents, who had neglected to train you up in one of the professions that fitted Mrs. Parker's parlours.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="首先，帕克太太会领你去看那双开间的客厅。当她在滔滔不绝地夸说屋子的优点以及那位住了八年的先生的好处时，你根本不敢打断她的话头。接着，你总算吞吞吐吐地说，你既不是大夫，也不是牙医。帕克太太听取这番话时的神气，准会使你对你的父母大起反感，嗔怪他们当初为什么没有把你培养成为适合帕克太太的客厅的人才。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">If you survived Mrs. Parker's scorn, you were taken to look at Mr. Skidder's large hall room on the third floor. Mr. Skidder's room was not vacant. He wrote plays and smoked cigarettes in it all day long. But every room-hunter was made to visit his room to admire the lambrequins. After each visit, Mr. Skidder, from the fright caused by possible eviction, would pay something on his rent.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then -- oh, then -- if you still stood on one foot, with your hot hand clutching the three moist dollars in your pocket, and hoarsely proclaimed your hideous and culpable poverty, nevermore would Mrs. Parker be cicerone of yours. She would honk loudly the word" Clara," she would show you her back, and march downstairs. Then Clara, the coloured maid, would escort you up the carpeted ladder that served for the fourth flight, and show you the Skylight Room. It occupied 7x8 feet of floor space at the middle of the hall. On each side of it was a dark lumber closet or storeroom.</div>

<div class="line_en">Clara, the coloured maid, found the door locked at 10 the next day, and they forced it open. Vinegar, and the slapping of wrists and burnt feathers proving of no avail, some one ran to 'phone for an ambulance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天上午十点钟，黑使女克拉拉发觉丽森小姐的房门还锁着，他们把它撞开。擦生醋，打手腕，给她嗅烧焦的羽毛都不见效，有人便跑去打电话叫救护车。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In due time it backed up to the door with much gong-clanging, and the capable young medico, in his white linen coat, ready, active, confident, with his smooth face half debonair, half grim, danced up the steps.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没多久，救护车铛啷铛啷地开到，倒退着停在门口。那位穿着白亚麻布罩衣的年轻干练的医生跳上了石阶，他的举止沉着、灵活、镇静，他那光洁的脸上显得又潇洒，又严肃。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Ambulance call to 49," he said briefly. "What's the trouble?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“四十九号叫的救护车来了。”他简洁地说。“出了什么事？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What room?" cried the doctor in a terrible voice, to which Mrs. Parker was a stranger.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“什么房间？”医生暴喊起来，帕克太太生平没有听到过这种询问房间的口气。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, yes, doctor," sniffed Mrs. Parker, as though her trouble that there should be trouble in the house was the greater. "I can't think what can be the matter with her. Nothing we could do would bring her to. It's a young woman, a Miss Elsie -- yes, a Miss Elsie Leeson. Never before in my house --"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，不错，大夫。”帕克太太没好气地说，仿佛她屋子里出了什么事而引起的麻烦比什么都麻烦。“我不知道她是怎么搞的。我们用尽了各种办法，还是救不醒她。是个年轻的女人，一个叫做埃尔西——是的，埃尔西﹒丽森小姐。我这里从来没有出过——”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Evidently the ambulance doctor was familiar with the location of skylight rooms. He was gone up the stairs, four at a time. Mrs. Parker followed slowly, as her dignity demanded.</div>

<div class="line_en">On the first landing she met him coming back bearing the astronomer in his arms. He stopped and let loose the practised scalpel of his tongue, not loudly. Gradually Mrs. Parker crumpled as a stiff garment that slips down from a nail. Ever afterward there remained crumples in her mind and body. Sometimes her curious roomers would ask her what the doctor said to her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她刚走到第一个楼梯口，就看见医生抱着那个天文学家下来了。他站住后，那训练有素，象解剖刀一般锋利的舌头，就任性地把她数落了一顿，可声音却不高。帕克太太象是一件从钉子上滑落下来的浆硬的衣服，慢慢地皱缩起来。此后，她的身心上永远留下了皱纹。有时，她的好奇的房客们问她，医生究竟对她说了些什么。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Let that be," she would answer. "If I can get forgiveness for having heard it I will be satisfied."</div>

<div class="line_en">They noticed that he did not lay down upon the bed prepared for it in the ambulance the form that he carried, and all that he said was: "Drive like h**l, Wilson," to the driver.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们注意到，医生并没有把他抱着的人安顿在救护车里专用的担架上，他只是对司机说：“拼命快开吧，威尔逊。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The ambulance physician strode with his burden through the pack of hounds that follow the curiosity chase, and even they fell back along the sidewalk abashed, for his face was that of one who bears his own dead.</div>
