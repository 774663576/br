<div class="line_en">Lydia is dead. But they don't know this yet. 1977, May 3, six thirty in the morning, no one knows anything but this innocuous fact: Lydia is late for breakfast. As always, next to her cereal bowl, her mother has placed a sharpened pencil and Lydia's physics homework, six problems flagged with small ticks. Driving to work, Lydia's father nudges the dial toward WXKP, Northwest Ohio's Best News Source, vexed by the crackles of static. On the stairs, Lydia's brother yawns, still twined in the tail end of his dream. And in her chair in the corner of the kitchen, Lydia's sister hunches moon-eyed over her cornflakes, sucking them to pieces one by one, waiting for Lydia to appear. It's she who says, at last, "Lydia's taking a long time today."</div>

<div class="line_en">Upstairs, Marilyn opens her daughter's door and sees the bed unslept in: neat hospital corners still pleated beneath the comforter, pillow still fluffed and convex. Nothing seems out of place. Mustard-colored corduroys tangled on the floor, a single rainbow-striped sock. A row of science fair ribbons on the wall, a postcard of Einstein. Lydia's duffel bag crumpled on the floor of the closet. Lydia's green bookbag slouched against her desk. Lydia's bottle of Baby Soft atop the dresser, a sweet, powdery, loved-baby scent still in the air. But no Lydia.</div>

Of course, when she looks, nothing has changed. The closed curtains glow like a blank television screen.</div>

<div class="line_en">Their mother steps back into the kitchen, and for one glorious fraction of a second Nath sighs with relief: there she is, Lydia, safe and sound. It happens sometimes -- their faces are so alike you'd see one in the corner of your eye and mistake her for the other: the same elfish chin and high cheekbones and left-cheek dimple, the same thin-shouldered build. Only the hair color is different, Lydia's ink-black instead of their mother's honey-blond. He and Hannah take after their father -- once a woman stopped the two of them in the grocery store and asked, "Chinese?" and when they said yes, not wanting to get into halves and wholes, she'd nodded sagely. "I knew it," she said. "By the eyes." She'd tugged the corner of each eye outward with a fingertip. But Lydia, defying genetics, somehow has her mother's blue eyes, and they know this is one more reason she is their mother's favorite. And their father's, too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们的母亲踱回厨房的时候，恍惚之间，内斯心底升起一股喜悦和释然：莉迪亚没有失踪，她好端端地在那里呢。难怪内斯会把母亲错看成莉迪亚，这种情况时有发生——母女俩长得很像，你要是用眼角的余光打量，非常有可能认错人：两人都是尖下巴、高颧骨、左边一个单酒窝、削肩膀。唯独头发的颜色不同，莉迪亚的是墨黑色，她母亲的头发是蜜棕色。内斯和汉娜则长得像父亲——有一次，一个女人在杂货店拦住他们问：“你们是中国人吗？”听到他们肯定的回答，女人点点头，表现出一副洞悉一切的样子。“我就知道，”她说，“从眼睛就能看出来。”说着，她用手指尖向外扳了扳外眼角。而莉迪亚却公然违抗遗传规律，不知怎么，她继承了母亲的蓝眼睛。他们知道，这是莉迪亚成为母亲宠儿的原因之一，当然，她也是父亲的宠儿。">查看中文翻译</div>

Nath stirs his cereal, which has turned to sludge at the bottom of his bowl. The clock in the front hall ticks, then strikes seven thirty. No one moves.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“车还在外面。”她说。不过，内斯早就预料到这个结果。莉迪亚不会开车，她连初学者驾照都没有。上个星期她没通过驾照考试，让全家人大吃一惊，父亲为此甚至都不让她坐在驾驶座上。内斯搅拌着麦片粥，粥里的麦片早就变成了碗底的烂泥。前厅的钟表滴答作响，然后传来七点半的报时声。大家都没动。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When the children have gone, she takes a mug from the cupboard, trying to keep her hands still. Long ago, when Lydia was a baby, Marilyn had once left her in the living room, playing on a quilt, and went into the kitchen for a cup of tea. She had been only eleven months old. Marilyn took the kettle off the stove and turned to find Lydia standing in the doorway. She had started and set her hand down on the hot burner. A red, spiral welt rose on her palm, and she touched it to her lips and looked at her daughter through watering eyes. Standing there, Lydia was strangely alert, as if she were taking in the kitchen for the first time. Marilyn didn't think about missing those first steps, or how grown up her daughter had become. The thought that flashed through her mind wasn't How did I miss it? but What else have you been hiding? Nath had pulled up and wobbled and tipped over and toddled right in front of her, but she didn't remember Lydia even beginning to stand. Yet she seemed so steady on her bare feet, tiny fingers just peeking from the ruffled sleeve of her romper. Marilyn often had her back turned, opening the refrigerator or turning over the laundry. Lydia could have begun walking weeks ago, while she was bent over a pot, and she would not have known.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="孩子们出门后，玛丽琳从碗柜里拿出一只马克杯。很久以前，莉迪亚还是个婴儿的时候，玛丽琳有一次在客厅里铺开一床被子，让莉迪亚在上面玩，自己则走到厨房煮茶。莉迪亚只有十一个月大，当玛丽琳把水壶从炉子上拿下来的时候，发现莉迪亚站在门口。她吓了一跳，结果手碰到了灼热的炉子，手掌立刻被烫红了，玛丽琳把红肿的手放到嘴边，眼泪汪汪地看着女儿。莉迪亚表现得十分戒备，因为她是第一次踏足厨房这片领地。玛丽琳并没想到自己错过了女儿学会走路时迈出的最初几步，也没有意识到女儿已经长大了。她脑子里旋转着的念头并非“我为什么错过了”，而是“你还有什么我不知道的本事”。内斯是在她眼皮底下摇摇晃晃学会了走路的，可她却不记得莉迪亚是什么时候学会站立的。但是，现在，莉迪亚已然赤着脚稳稳当当地站在那里，连身衣的裤筒下面露出小小的脚趾。玛丽琳经常背对着莉迪亚做家务，比如开冰箱或者翻动洗衣机里的衣服。莉迪亚可能在几周前就学会了走路，当时玛丽琳也许在忙着做饭，没有注意到。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She had scooped Lydia up and smoothed her hair and told her how clever she was, how proud her father would be when he came home. But she'd felt as if she'd found a locked door in a familiar room: Lydia, still small enough to cradle, had secrets.

<div class="line_en">She checks every room, opening every closet. She peeks into the empty garage: nothing but an oil spot on the concrete and the faint, heady smell of gasoline. She's not sure what she's looking for: Incriminating footprints? A trail of breadcrumbs? When she was twelve, an older girl from her school had disappeared and turned up dead. Ginny Barron. She'd worn saddle shoes that Marilyn had desperately coveted. She'd gone to the store to buy cigarettes for her father, and two days later they found her body by the side of the road, halfway to Charlottesville, strangled and naked.</div>

<div class="line_en">Now Marilyn's mind begins to churn. The summer of Son of Sam has just begun -- though the papers have only recently begun to call him by that name -- and, even in Ohio, headlines blare the latest shooting. In a few months, the police will catch David Berkowitz, and the country will focus again on other things: the death of Elvis, the new Atari, Fonzie soaring over a shark. At this moment, though, when dark-haired New Yorkers are buying blond wigs, the world seems to Marilyn a terrifying and random place. Things like that don't happen here, she reminds herself. Not in Middlewood, which calls itself a city but is really just a tiny college town of three thousand, where driving an hour gets you only to Toledo, where a Saturday night out means the roller rink or the bowling alley or the drive-in, where even Middlewood Lake, at the center of town, is really just a glorified pond. (She is wrong about this last one: it is a thousand feet across, and it is deep.) Still, the small of her back prickles, like beetles marching down her spine.</div>

<div class="line_en">He closes the paper and writes the score on the front page -- sixty-five out of one hundred -- and circles it. Every year as summer approaches, the students shuffle and rustle; sparks of resentment sizzle up like flares, then sputter out against the windowless walls of the lecture hall. Their papers grow halfhearted, paragraphs trailing off, sometimes midsentence, as if the students could not hold a thought that long. Was it a waste, he wonders. All the lecture notes he's honed, all the color slides of MacArthur and Truman and the maps of Guadalcanal. Nothing more than funny names to giggle at, the whole course just one more requirement to check off the list before they graduated. What else could he expect from this place? He stacks the paper with the others and drops the pen on top. Through the window he can see the small green quad and three kids in blue jeans tossing a Frisbee.</div>

<div class="line_en">When he was younger, still junior faculty, James was often mistaken for a student himself. That hasn't happened in years. He'll be forty-six next spring; he's tenured, a few silver hairs now mixed in among the black. Sometimes, though, he's still mistaken for other things. Once, a receptionist at the provost's office thought he was a visiting diplomat from Japan and asked him about his flight from Tokyo. He enjoys the surprise on people's faces when he tells them he's a professor of American history. "Well, I am American," he says when people blink, a barb of defensiveness in his tone.</div>

From the back she could have been his daughter: they had almost the same hair, hanging dark and glossy down to the shoulder blades, the same way of sitting with elbows pulled in close to the body. When she turned around, though, her face was completely her own, narrow where Lydia's was wide, her eyes brown and steady. "Professor Lee?" she had said, holding out her hand. "I'm Louisa Chen." Eighteen years at Middlewood College, he'd thought, and here was the first Oriental student he'd ever had. Without realizing it, he had found himself smiling.</div>

He wants to smash his fist into the middle of Stanley's grin, to feel Stanley's slightly crooked front tooth slice his knuckles. Instead he smashes the ladybug with his thumb. The shell snaps between his fingers, like a popcorn hull, and the insect crumbles to sulfur-colored powder. Stanley keeps running his finger along the spines of James's books. Later James will long for the ignorant calm of this moment, for that last second when Stan's leer was the worst problem on his mind. But for now, when the phone rings, he is so relieved at the interruption that at first he doesn't hear the anxiety in Marilyn's voice.</div>

Her face is a dare. The directness of her stare, straight out of the page with not even a hint of profile, says What are you looking at? In the picture, Nath can't distinguish the blue of her irises from the black of her pupils, her eyes like dark holes in the shiny paper. When he'd picked up the photos at the drugstore, he had regretted capturing this moment, the hard look on his sister's face.

Nath doesn't correct them, but these girls have never been Lydia's friends. Lydia has been in school with them since kindergarten, and now and then they call, giggly and shrill, and Lydia shouts through the line, "I got it." Some evenings she sits for hours on the window seat on the landing, the phone base cradled in her lap, receiver wedged between ear and shoulder. When their parents walk by, she lowers her voice to a confidential murmur, twirling the cord around her little finger until they go away.

<div class="line_en">But Nath's seen Lydia at school, how in the cafeteria she sits silent while the others chatter; how, when they've finished copying her homework, she quietly slides her notebook back into her bookbag. After school, she walks to the bus alone and settles into the seat beside him in silence. Once, he had stayed on the phone line after Lydia picked up and heard not gossip, but his sister's voice duly rattling off assignments -- read Act I of Othello, do the odd-numbered problems in Section 5-- then quiet after the hang-up click. The next day, while Lydia was curled on the window seat, phone pressed to her ear, he'd picked up the extension in the kitchen and heard only the low drone of the dial tone. Lydia has never really had friends, but their parents have never known. If their father says, "Lydia, how's Pam doing?"

<div class="line_en">All spring, Lydia has been hanging around Jack -- or the other way around. Every afternoon, practically, driving around in that Beetle of his, coming home just in time for dinner, when she pretended she'd been at school all the time. It had emerged suddenly, this friendship -- Nath refused to use any other word. Jack and his mother have lived on the corner since the first grade, and once Nath thought they could be friends. It hadn't turned out that way. Jack had humiliated him in front of the other kids, had laughed when Nath's mother was gone, when Nath had thought she might never come back. As if, Nath thinks now, as if Jack had any right to be talking, when he had no father. All the neighbors had whispered about it when the Wolffs had moved in, how Janet Wolff was divorced, how Jack ran wild while she worked late shifts at the hospital. That summer, they'd whispered about Nath's parents, too -- but Nath's mother had come back. Jack's mother was still divorced. And Jack still ran wild.</div>

<div class="line_en">And now? Just last week, driving home from an errand, he'd seen Jack out walking that dog of his. He had come around the lake, about to turn onto their little dead-end street, when he saw Jack on the path by the bank, tall and lanky, the dog loping just ahead of him toward a tree. Jack was wearing an old, faded T-shirt and his sandy curls stood up, unbrushed. As Nath drove past, Jack looked up and gave the merest nod of the head, a cigarette clenched in the corner of his mouth. The gesture, Nath had thought, was less one of greeting than of recognition. Beside Jack, the dog had stared him in the eye and casually lifted its leg. And Lydia had spent all spring with him.</div>

<div class="line_en">If he says anything now, Nath thinks, they'll say, Why didn't we know about this before? He'll have to explain that all those afternoons when he'd said, "Lydia's studying with a friend," or "Lydia's staying after to work on math," he had really meant, She's with Jack or She's riding in Jack's car or She's out with him god knows where.

<div class="line_en">Across the table, Marilyn looks up the numbers in the phone book and reads them out; James does the calling, carefully and slowly, clicking the dial around with one finger. With each call his voice becomes more confused. No? She didn't mention anything to you, any plans? Oh. I see. Well. Thank you anyway. Nath studies the grain of the kitchen table, the open album in front of him. The missing photo leaves a gap in the page, a clear plastic window showing the blank white lining of the cover. Their mother runs her hand down the column of the phone book, staining her fingertip gray. Under cover of the tablecloth, Hannah stretches her legs and touches one toe to Nath's. A toe of comfort. But he doesn't look up. Instead he closes the album, and across the table, his mother crosses another name off the list.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="桌子对面，玛丽琳翻看着电话簿，念出上面的号码；詹姆斯负责拨号，动作小心缓慢，用一根手指拨动号码盘。随着一个个电话打出去，他的语气也越来越疑惑：“是吗？她没和你说过什么计划吗？噢，我知道了。好吧，无论如何还是谢谢你。”内斯打量着厨房桌子的纹理，还有摆在面前打开着的相册。相片被抽走的那一页留下了一块空白，透过空空如也的塑料套，可以看到相册封底的白边。他们的母亲一只手在电话簿上由上到下划动，指尖都被油墨染成了灰色。汉娜伸过腿来，脚趾碰到了内斯的脚趾，这让他觉得有些安心，但他并没有抬头，而是合上相册。桌子对面的母亲又划掉了名单上的一个名字。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When they've called the last number, James puts the telephone down. He takes the slip of paper from Marilyn and crosses out Karen Adler, bisecting the K into two neat Vs. Under the line he can still see the name. Karen Adler. Marilyn never let Lydia go out on weekends until she'd finished all her schoolwork -- and by then, it was usually Sunday afternoon. Sometimes, those Sunday afternoons, Lydia met her friends at the mall, wheedling a ride: "A couple of us are going to the movies. Annie Hall. Karen is dying to see it." He'd pull a ten from his wallet and push it across the table to her, meaning: All right, now go and have some fun. He realizes now that he had never seen a ticket stub, that for as long as he can remember, Lydia had been alone on the curb when he came to take her home. Dozens of evenings he'd paused at the foot of the stairs and smiled, listening to Lydia's half of a conversation float down from the landing above: "Oh my god, I know, right? So then what did she say?" But now, he knows, she hasn't called Karen or Pam or Jenn in years. He thinks now of those long afternoons, when they'd thought she was staying after school to study. Yawning gaps of time when she could have been anywhere, doing anything. In a moment, James realizes he's obliterated Karen Adler's name under a crosshatch of black ink.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="打完最后一串号码，詹姆斯放下电话，从玛丽琳手中接过名单，划掉“卡伦·阿德勒”这个名字，字母“K”被他划出的线拦腰截断，变成了两个工整的“V”。不过，透过这条线，他还是能看清这个名字：卡伦·阿德勒。周末的时候，除非莉迪亚已经完成所有的家庭作业，否则玛丽琳是不会允许她出去玩的——而等她完成的时候，通常已经是星期天下午了。在某些这样的星期天下午，莉迪亚会去购物中心见朋友，让父亲开车接送她，比如：“我们几个人要去看电影《安妮·霍尔》，卡伦非常想看。”詹姆斯会从钱包里抽出一张十美元纸币，推到桌子对面的女儿眼前，这个动作的意思是：好的，去吧，玩得开心。现在他突然意识到，自己从未见过任何一张电影票根，他想起来，当他开车到购物中心接女儿回家时，莉迪亚是独自站在人行道上等他的。不知有多少个夜晚，他曾经微笑着在楼梯下面收住步子，听着莉迪亚打电话的声音从楼梯平台上传来：“噢，天哪，我知道的，对吧？那么，她接下来怎么说的？”可是现在，他反应过来，莉迪亚已经好几年没有给卡伦、帕姆或者珍打电话了。他想起那些漫长的下午，他们还以为莉迪亚放学后留在学校学习，而实际上她可能去到任何地方，做任何事情。想到这里，詹姆斯蓦然发现，他已经用黑色墨水在卡伦·阿德勒的名字上画了无数条交叉线。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He tries to think: had Lydia seemed strange the night before? He had been away four whole days, by himself for the first time in his life, visiting Harvard -- Harvard! -- where he would be headed in the fall. In those last days of class before reading period --"Two weeks to cram and party before exams," his host student, Andy, had explained -- the campus had had a restless, almost festive air. All weekend he'd wandered awestruck, trying to take it all in: the fluted pillars of the enormous library, the red brick of the buildings against the bright green of the lawns, the sweet chalk smell that lingered in each lecture hall. The purposeful stride he saw in everyone's walk, as if they knew they were destined for greatness. Friday he had spent the night in a sleeping bag on Andy's floor and woke up at one when Andy's roommate, Wes, came in with his girlfriend. The light had flicked on and Nath froze in place, blinking at the doorway, where a tall, bearded boy and the girl holding his hand slowly emerged from the blinding haze. She had long, red hair, loose in waves around her face. "Sorry," Wes had said and flipped the lights off, and Nath heard their careful footsteps as they made their way across the common room to Wes's bedroom. He had kept his eyes open, letting them readjust to the dark, thinking, So this is what college is like.</div>

Lydia had been holed up in her room, and when they sat down at the table, he'd asked her how the past few days had been.

Advanced English. Not meant for fifth graders. She'd filched it from Lydia's room a few weeks ago, and Lydia hadn't even noticed. Over the past two weeks she's worked her way through it, a little each night, savoring the words like a cherry Life Saver tucked inside her cheek. Tonight, somehow, the book seems different. Only when she flips back, to where she stopped the day before, does she understand. Throughout, Lydia has underlined words here and there, occasionally scribbling a note from class lectures. Order vs. chaos. Corruption of Southern aristocratic values. After this page, the book is untouched. Hannah flips through the rest: no notes, no doodles, no blue to break up the black. She's reached the point where Lydia stopped reading, she realizes, and she doesn't feel like reading any more.</div>

<div class="line_en">Last night, lying awake, she had watched the moon drift across the sky like a slow balloon. She couldn't see it moving, but if she looked away, then back through the window, she could see that it had. In a little while, she had thought, it would impale itself on the shadow of the big spruce in the backyard. It took a long time. She was almost asleep when she heard a soft thud, and for a moment she thought that the moon had actually hit the tree. But when she looked outside, the moon was gone, almost hidden behind a cloud.

A vision of life without her sister in it had flashed across her mind. She would have the good chair at the table, looking out the window at the lilac bushes in the yard, the big bedroom downstairs near everyone else.

<div class="line_en">It's not until Wednesday afternoon that a passerby notices the rowboat out on the lake, adrift in the windless day. Years ago, the lake had been Middlewood's reservoir, before the water tower was built. Now, edged with grass, it's a swimming hole in summer; kids dive off the wooden dock, and for birthday parties and picnics, a park employee unties the rowboat kept there. No one thinks much of it: a slipped mooring, a harmless prank. It is not a priority. A note is made for an officer to check it; a note is made for the commissioner of parks. It's not until late Wednesday, almost midnight, that a lieutenant, going over loose ends from the day shift, makes the connection and calls the Lees to ask if Lydia ever played with the boat on the lake.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="星期三下午，一位路人发现，湖上有一艘小船在无风的天气里漂浮。几年前，水塔还没建成的时候，这个湖曾经是米德伍德的水库。如今，湖边长起一圈青草，成为夏季的游泳池，孩子们站在木质的小码头上跳水，人们在湖边开生日派对或者野餐。这条小船的缆绳可能是某位公园管理员解开的，泊船的时候没注意，或者是一个无伤大雅的玩笑，没人会在意这些小事。有人知会了警察，也告诉了公园的管理人。直到星期三深夜接近凌晨，一位警官在察看当天巡逻记录时，才把漂浮的小船和失踪案联系起来，于是，他给李家打了电话，询问莉迪亚是否会到湖里的船上玩。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Of course not," James says. Lydia had refused, refused, to take swim classes at the Y. He'd been a swimmer as a teenager himself; he'd taught Nath to swim at age three. With Lydia he'd started too late, and she was already five when he took her to the pool for the first time and waded into the shallow end, water barely to his waist, and waited. Lydia would not even come near the water. She'd laid down in her swimsuit by the side of the pool and cried, and James finally hoisted himself out, swim trunks dripping but top half dry, and promised he would not make her jump. Even now, though the lake is so close, Lydia goes in just ankle-deep in summer, to wash the dirt from her feet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“当然不会。”詹姆斯说，莉迪亚拒绝——是拒绝——学游泳。詹姆斯十几岁时就加入了游泳队，还在内斯三岁时教会了他游泳。可对于莉迪亚，他教得太晚，女儿都五岁了，詹姆斯才第一次带她去游泳池。他站在浅水区等女儿过来，水还没有没过他的腰部。莉迪亚根本不愿往水里走，她穿着泳衣，躺在池边哭了起来，詹姆斯最后只能放弃，还得向女儿保证他不会逼她跳进水里。因为等的时间太长，他泳裤的上半部分早就干了。虽然米德伍德湖离家很近，但即使现在，到了夏天，莉迪亚也只敢走进脚踝深的水里冲洗一下脚上的尘土而已。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Of course not," James says again. "Lydia doesn't know how to swim." It's not until he says these words into the telephone that he understands why the police are asking. As he speaks, the entire family catches a chill, as if they know exactly what the police will find.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“当然不会，”詹姆斯又重复一遍，“莉迪亚不会游泳。”直到对着听筒讲完这些话，他才明白警察这样问的原因。他打电话的过程中，全家人都不寒而栗，似乎已经猜出来警察会发现什么。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It's not until early Thursday morning, just after dawn, that the police drag the lake and find her.</div>
