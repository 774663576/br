<div class="line_en">"What did they row about?" he asked, trying to sound casual as they turned onto a seventh-floor corridor that was deserted but for a very small girl who had been examining a tapestry of trolls in tutus. She looked terrified at the sight of the approaching sixth years and dropped the heavy brass scales she was carrying.</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry and Ron left the hospital wing first thing on Monday morning, restored to full health by the ministrations of Madam Pomfrey and now able to enjoy the benefits of having been knocked out and poisoned, the best of which was that Hermione was friends with Ron again. Hermione even escorted them down to breakfast, bringing with her the news that Ginny had argued with Dean. The drowsing creature in Harry's chest suddenly raised its head, sniffing the air hopefully.</div>

<div class="line_en">He stopped talking very suddenly. Lavender Brown was standing at the foot of the marble staircase looking thunderous.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ron looked both sulky and annoyed when he appeared at breakfast half an hour later, and though he sat with Lavender, Harry did not see them exchange a word all the time they were together. Hermione was acting as though she was quite oblivious to all of this, but once or twice Harry saw an inexplicable smirk cross her face. All that day she seemed to be in a particularly good mood, and that evening in the common room she even consented to look over (in other words, finish writing) Harry's Herbology essay, something she had been resolutely refusing to do up to this point, because she had known that Harry would then let Ron copy his work. "Don't worry, sir," said Harry at once, anxious about Dumbledore's extreme pallor and by his air of exhaustion. "Don't worry, I'll get us back… Lean on me, sir…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="罗恩半小时后来吃早饭时，显得很恼火。虽然他和拉文德坐在一起，但哈利没见他们说一句话。赫敏好像对这一切浑然不觉，但有一两次哈利看到她脸上掠过一丝令人不解的笑意。一整天她心情似乎特别好，晚上在公共休息室她甚至答应看看（也就是帮着写完）哈利的草药课论文。在此之前她是坚决不肯的，因为她知道哈利会借给罗恩去抄。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"C'mon," Harry muttered to Hermione, and they sped past, though not before they had heard Lavender say, "Why didn't you tell me you were getting out today? And why was she with you?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"Thanks a lot, Hermione," said Harry, giving her a hasty pat on the back as he checked his watch and saw that it was nearly eight o'clock. "Listen, I've got to hurry or I'll be late for Dumbledore…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“多谢了，赫敏。”哈利说着匆匆拍了拍她的肩膀，又看了看表，发现已经快八点了，“哟，我得快点儿，不然去邓布利多那儿就要迟到了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She did not answer, but merely crossed out a few of his feebler sentences in a weary sort of way. Grinning, Harry hurried out through the portrait hole and off to the headmasters office. The gargoyle leapt aside at the mention of toffee eclairs, and Harry took the spiral staircase two steps at a time, knocking on the door just as a clock within chimed eight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她没有回答，只是没精打采地画掉了他的几个差劲的句子。哈利咧嘴一笑，赶紧爬出肖像洞口，朝校长办公室跑去。滴水嘴状石头怪兽听到“太妃手指饼”后跳到一边。哈利一步两级地登上螺旋形楼梯，他敲门时里面的钟正好打了八点。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Aha!" she cried, pointing dramatically at Harry as she blinked at him through her magnifying spectacles. "So this is the reason I am to be thrown unceremoniously from your office, Dumbledore!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“啊哈！”她戏剧性地指着哈利，从她那像放大镜一样的镜片后面眨着眼睛看着他，“这就是我被粗暴地赶出你办公室的原因，邓布利多！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Enter," called Dumbledore, but as Harry put out a hand to push the door, it was wrenched open from inside. There stood Professor Trelawney.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“进来。”邓布利多叫道。哈利伸手去推门，门却从里面被猛地拽开了，特里劳妮教授站在那儿。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“请关上门，坐下，哈利。”邓布利多的声音有些疲惫。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry obeyed, noticing as he took his usual seat in front of Dumbledore's desk that the Pensieve lay between them once more, as did two more tiny crystal bottles full of swirling memory.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利照办了，坐在邓布利多桌前那个老位子上，他注意到冥想盆又摆在那里，还有两个小水晶瓶，里面是打着旋的记忆。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No," said Dumbledore, "Divination is turning out to be much more trouble than I could have foreseen, never having studied the subject myself. I cannot ask Firenze to return to the forest, where he is now an outcast, nor can I ask Sybill Trelawney to leave. Between ourselves, she has no idea of the danger she would be in outside the castle. She does not know -- and I think it would be unwise to enlighten her -- that she made the prophecy about you and Voldemort, you see."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不高兴，”邓布利多说，“占卜课比我想象的麻烦得多，我本人从没上过这个课。我不能让费伦泽回到林子里去，因为他被驱逐出来了。我也不能让西比尔·特里劳妮离开。我们私下说说：她没意识到城堡外有多么危险。她还不知道——我觉得告诉她这个也是不明智的——她做过关于你和伏地魔的预言。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dumbledore heaved a deep sigh, then said, "But never mind my staffing problems. We have much more important matters to discuss. Firstly -- have you managed the task I set you at the end of our previous lesson?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="邓布利多深深叹了口气，说道：“不过，别管我的教员的事了。我们有更重要的事情要谈。首先——你做了我上节课布置的作业吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I see," said Dumbledore eventually, peering at Harry over the top of his half-moon spectacles and giving Harry the usual sensation that he was being X-rayed. "And you feel that you have exerted your very best efforts in this matter, do you? That you have exercised all of your considerable ingenuity? That you have left no depth of cunning unplumbed in your quest to retrieve the memory?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“噢，”邓布利多多半月形的眼镜片上方盯着哈利，哈利又有一种被X光照射的感觉，“你觉得已经尽了最大努力，是吗？已经充分发挥了你的聪明才智？想尽了一切点子？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Ah," said Harry, brought up short. What with Apparition lessons and Quidditch and Ron being poisoned and getting his skull cracked and his determination to find out what Draco Malfoy was up to, Harry had almost forgotten about the memory Dumbledore had asked him to extract from Professor Slughorn. "Well, I asked Professor Slughorn about it at the end of Potions, sir, but, er, he wouldn't give it to me." There was a little silence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“啊，”哈利猛然想起，因为幻影显形课、魁地奇比赛、罗恩中毒、自己头骨碎裂，还有一心要搞清马尔福在干什么，他几乎忘了邓布利多要他搞到斯拉格霍恩的记忆……“嗯，魔药课后我问了一下斯拉格霍恩教授，可是，呃，他不肯给我。”片刻的沉默。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well," Harry stalled, at a loss for what to say next. His single attempt to get hold of the memory suddenly seemed embarrassingly feeble. "Well… the day Ron swallowed love potion by mistake I took him to Professor Slughorn. I thought maybe if I got Professor Slughorn in a good enough mood --"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“呃。”哈利语塞了，不知该说什么。他的那一次尝试突然显得那么微不足道。“呃……罗恩误服了迷情剂的那天，我把他带到斯拉格霍恩教授那里，我想如果能让斯拉格霍恩教授心情好，也许——”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A hot, prickly feeling of shame spread from the top of Harry's head all the way down his body. Dumbledore had not raised his voice, he did not even sound angry, but Harry would have preferred him to yell; this cold disappointment was worse than anything.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一阵火辣辣的、针扎一般的羞耻感从哈利的头顶传遍全身。邓布利多没有提高嗓门，甚至话语中也没带怒气，但哈利宁愿他大吼大叫，这种冰冷的失望比什么都令人难受。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"And did that work?" asked Dumbledore.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“成功了吗？”邓布利多问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"-- which, naturally, made you forget all about trying to retrieve the memory; I would have expected nothing else, while your best friend was in danger. Once it became clear that Mr. Weasley was going to make a full recovery, however, I would have hoped that you returned to the task I set you. I thought I made it clear to you how very important that memory is. Indeed, I did my best to impress upon you that it is the most crucial memory of all and that we will be wasting our time without it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“——自然，于是你就忘了找寻记忆的事，我没指望会有别的反应，因为你的好朋友有危险。但是，一旦确定韦斯莱同学会彻底康复，我以为你会回头做我布置的作业。我已对你说明那个记忆多么重要。实际上，我已竭力让你认识到那是最关键的一段记忆，没有它，我们只会浪费时间。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Silence fell between them again, the most uncomfortable silence Harry had ever experienced with Dumbledore; it seemed to go on and on, punctuated only by the little grunting snores of the portrait of Armando Dippet over Dumbledore's head. Harry felt strangely diminished, as though he had shrunk a little since he had entered the room. When he could stand it no longer he said, "Professor Dumbledore, I'm really sorry. I should have done more… I should have realized you wouldn't have asked me to do it if it wasn't really important."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两人又沉默了，这是哈利在邓布利多身边经历过的最难堪的沉默，它似乎无休无止，只是时而被邓布利多头顶上阿芒多·迪佩特哼哼哧哧的鼾声打断。哈利有一种奇怪的渺小感，好像自己进屋后缩小了。他再也受不了了，于是说道：“邓布利多教授，我真的很抱歉。我应该做得更多……我应该想到如果不是真的重要，你也不会叫我去做。”">查看中文翻译</div>

If it was difficult to find evidence about the boy Riddle, it has been almost impossible to find anyone prepared to reminisce about the man Voldemort. In fact, I doubt whether there is a soul alive, apart from himself, who could give us a full account of his life since he left Hogwarts. However, I have two last memories that I would like to share with you." Dumbledore indicated the two little crystal bottles gleaming beside the Pensieve. "I shall then be glad of your opinion as to whether the conclusions I have drawn from them seem likely."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“但现在，哈利，现在情况更加迷离而诡异，如果说找到关于少年里德尔的证据已很困难，那找到能记忆成年伏地魔的人则几乎不可能。事实上，我怀疑除了他自己之外，是否还有一个活人能向我们详细讲述他离开霍格沃茨后的生活。然而，我有最后两个记忆要跟你分享。”邓布利多说着指了指在冥想盆旁边闪闪发亮的两个小水晶瓶，“之后，我将很高兴听你判断我所得出的结论是否合理。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"He reached the seventh year of his schooling with, as you might have expected, top grades in every examination he had taken. All around him, his classmates were deciding which jobs they were to pursue once they had left Hogwarts. Nearly everybody expected spectacular things from Tom Riddle, prefect, Head Boy, winner of the Award for Special Services to the School. I know that several teachers, Professor Slughorn amongst them, suggested that he join the Ministry of Magic, offered to set up appointments, put him in touch with useful contacts. He refused all offers. The next thing the staff knew, Voldemort was working at Borgin and Burkes."</div>

But this was not Voldemort's first choice of job. Hardly anyone knew of it at the time -- I was one of the few in whom the then headmaster confided -- but Voldemort first approached Professor Dippet and asked whether he could remain at Hogwarts as a teacher."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“博金－博克。”邓布利多平静地说，“我想，等进入了郝琪的记忆，你就会看到那个地方对他有什么吸引力了。但这不是伏地魔的第一选择。当时没什么人知道——我是听老校长说过此事的少数人之一。伏地魔先找了迪佩特教授，询问他是否可以留在霍格沃茨执教。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I believe he had several reasons, though he confided none of them to Professor Dippet," said Dumbledore. "Firstly, and very importantly, Voldemort was, I believe, more attached to this school than he has ever been to a person. Hogwarts was where he had been happiest; the first and only place he had felt at home."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我相信他有好几条理由，尽管他一条也没有告诉迪佩特教授。”邓布利多说，“首先，很重要的一条是，伏地魔对这所学校比他对任何个人更有感情。霍格沃茨是他最开心的地方，是他感到像家的第一个也是惟一的地方。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"And thirdly, as a teacher, he would have had great power and influence over young witches and wizards. Perhaps he had gained the idea from Professor Slughorn, the teacher with whom he was on best terms, who had demonstrated how influential a role a teacher can play. I do not imagine for an instant that Voldemort envisaged spending the rest of his life at Hogwarts, but I do think that he saw it as a useful recruiting ground, and a place where he might begin to build himself an army."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“第三，当了教师，他可以对少年巫师有很大的影响力。这个思想或许来自斯拉格霍恩教授，那是跟他关系最好的一位教授。斯拉格霍恩使他看到教师能发挥多么大的影响。我从来没有以为伏地魔打算在霍格沃茨待一辈子，我认为他是把这里看成一个招兵买马的好地方，他可以给自己拉起一支队伍。”">查看中文翻译</div>

Voldemort had committed another murder; whether it was his first since he killed the Riddles, I do not know, but I think it was. This time, as you will have seen, he killed not for revenge, but for gain. He wanted the two fabulous trophies that poor, besotted, old woman showed him.

His features were not those Harry had seen emerge from the great stone cauldron almost two years ago: They were not as snake-like, the eyes were not yet scarlet, the face not yet masklike, and yet he was no longer handsome Tom Riddle. It was as though his features had been burned and blurred; they were waxy and oddly distorted, and the whites of the eyes now had a permanently bloody look, though the pupils were not yet the slits that Harry knew they would become. He was wearing a long black cloak, and his face was as pale as the snow glistening on his shoulders.</div>

<div class="line_en">Dumbledore raised his eyebrows. "And what will become of those whom you command? What will happen to those who call themselves -- or so rumor has it -- the Death Eaters?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry could tell that Voldemort had not expected Dumbledore to know this name; he saw Voldemort's eyes flash red again and the slitlike nostrils flare.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利看出伏地魔没想到邓布利多知道这个名字：他看到伏地魔的眼睛又闪着红光，两道缝隙般的鼻孔张大了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Then if I were to go to the Hog's Head tonight, I would not find a group of them -- Nott, Rosier, Muldber, Dolohov -- awaiting your return?

<div class="line_cn" title="“那么，如果我今晚去猪头酒吧，不会看到那群人——诺特、罗齐尔、穆尔塞伯、多洛霍夫——在等你回去吧？真是忠诚的朋友啊，跟你在雪夜里跋涉了这么远，只是为了祝你谋到一个教职。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You are mistaken," said Voldemort.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你错了。”伏地魔说。">查看中文翻译</div>
