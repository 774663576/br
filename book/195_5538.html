<div class="line_en">It seemed to Philip, brooding over these matters, that in the true painters, writers, musicians, there was a power which drove them to such complete absorption in their work as to make it inevitable for them to subordinate life to art. Succumbing to an influence they never realised, they were merely dupes of the instinct that possessed them, and life slipped through their fingers unlived. But he had a feeling that life was to be lived rather than portrayed, and he wanted to search out the various experiences of it and wring from each moment all the emotion that it offered. He made up his mind at length to take a certain step and abide by the result, and, having made up his mind, he determined to take the step at once. Luckily enough the next morning was one of Foinet's days, and he resolved to ask him point-blank whether it was worth his while to go on with the study of art. He had never forgotten the master's brutal advice to Fanny Price. It had been sound. Philip could never get Fanny entirely out of his head. The studio seemed strange without her, and now and then the gesture of one of the women working there or the tone of a voice would give him a sudden start, reminding him of her: her presence was more noticuble?? now she was dead than it had ever been during her life; and he often dreamed of her at night, waking with a cry of terror. it was horrible to think of all the suffering she must have endured.</div>

<div class="line_en">Philip knew that on the days Foinet came to the studio he lunched at a little restaurant in the Rue d'Odessa, and he hurried his own meal so that he could go and wait outside till the painter came out. Philip walked up and down the crowded street and at last saw Monsieur Foinet walking, with bent head, towards him; Philip was very nervous, but he forced himself to go up to him.</div>

<div class="line_en">Philip had nothing to say. He walked silently by the master's side. He felt horribly sick. It had never struck him that Foinet would wish to see his things there and then; he meant, so that he might have time to prepare himself, to ask him if he would mind coming at some future date or whether he might bring them to Foinet's studio. He was trembling with anxiety. In his heart he hoped that Foinet would look at his picture, and that rare smile would come into his face, and he would shake Philip's hand and say: "Pas mal. Go on, my lad. You have talent, real talent." Philip's heart swelled at the thought. It was such a relief, such a joy! Now he could go on with courage; and what did hardship matter, privation, and disappointment, if he arrived at last? He had worked very hard, it would be too cruel if all that industry were futile. And then with a start he remembered that he had heard Fanny Price say just that. They arrived at the house, and Philip was seized with fear. If he had dared he would have asked Foinet to go away. He did not want to know the truth. They went in and the concierge handed him a letter as they passed. He glanced at the envelope and recognised his uncle's handwriting. Foinet followed him up the stairs. Philip could think of nothing to say; Foinet was mute, and the silence got on his nerves. The professor sat down; and Philip without a word placed before him the picture which the Salon had rejected; Foinet nodded but did not speak; then Philip showed him the two portraits he had made of Ruth Chalice, two or three landscapes which he had painted at Moret, and a number of sketches.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="菲利普无话可说。他一声不吭地走在老师身边，紧张得胃里阵阵翻腾。他从来没想过福瓦内会当场决定来看自己的画。他本想试探着问问他有没有时间，介不介意过两天来家里做客，或者也可以直接把画拿到画室去。此刻，他害怕得浑身发抖，暗暗希望福瓦内看过画后，脸上会挤出一个难得一见的微笑，握着他的手激动地说：“真不错。加油吧，小家伙。你是块画画的料，有点真本事！”光是这样想想，菲利普就觉得心花怒放了。要真是这样该多好啊！他一定会鼓起勇气坚持下去，只要能到达胜利的终点，一路的艰难险阻、穷困潦倒又算得了什么呢？他已经付出了这么多，万一所有的努力都无疾而终，那对自己绝对是一记残忍的打击。想到这，他一下惊呆了，因为这些话正是范宁·普里斯曾经说过的啊。忐忑不安的菲利普带着福瓦内来到了画室。要是他胆子大一点的话，这会儿就会狠狠心把福瓦内赶走了。因为真相到底是什么，他其实并不想知道。进门的时候门房递给他一封信。他瞄了一眼信封，上面是伯伯的笔迹。福瓦内跟着他上了楼。楼梯上，菲利普想不出应该聊点什么，福瓦内也紧闭着嘴一声不吭。这种沉默搞得他心神不安。进了屋，他坐了下来，菲利普默默地把被展览会打回来的画拿给他看。福瓦内点点头，照旧一言不发。菲利普又给他看了两幅自己画的露丝·查理斯肖像、两三张他在莫雷画的风景画和一些素描作品。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"There is nothing so degrading as the constant anxiety about one's means of livelihood. I have nothing but contempt for the people who despise money. They are hypocrites or fools. Money is like a sixth sense without which you cannot make a complete use of the other five. Without an adequate income half the possibilities of life are shut off. The only thing to be careful about is that you do not pay more than a shilling for the shilling you earn. You will hear people say that poverty is the best spur to the artist. They have never felt the iron of it in their flesh. They do not know how mean it makes you. It exposes you to endless humiliation, it cuts your wings, it eats into your soul like a cancer. It is not wealth one asks for, but just enough to preserve one's dignity, to work unhampered, to be generous, frank, and independent. I pity with all my heart the artist, whether he writes or paints, who is entirely dependent for subsistence upon his art."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没有比为了生计发愁更丢人的事儿了。有些人大言不惭地说自己不把钱当回事儿，我最鄙视这种人。不是伪君子就是傻子。钱这玩意儿就像第六感，没有它，剩下的五感都发挥不了最佳作用。没有足够的银子进账，生活里就少了一半的可能。唯一要注意的是，你不能花两个子儿的成本来挣回一个子儿的价值。你可能会听到别人说贫穷是对艺术家的最佳鞭策。说这话的人从来都没受过穷啊。贫穷就像扎进你皮肤里的钉子，他们不知道这会让人变得多么抠门，会让你遭受多少羞辱。贫穷会砍掉你的翅膀，像癌细胞一样侵噬你的灵魂。倒不是说要有多富裕，可起码要有足够的钱来维持尊严，有足够的底气不受打扰地工作，能慷慨诚实地做事，能不靠他人独立生活。不管是画画的还是写字的，但凡一个艺术家要靠自己的作品吃饱肚子，我都深深地为他感到同情。”">查看中文翻译</div>

She had been ill for the last three months, and he had offered to go over to England and see her; but she, fearing it would interfere with his work, had refused. She did not want him to put himself to inconvenience; she said she would wait till August and then she hoped he would come and stay at the vicarage for two or three weeks. If by any chance she grew worse she would let him know, since she did not wish to die without seeing him again. If his uncle wrote to him it must be because she was too ill to hold a pen.
