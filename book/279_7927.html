<div class="line_en">Then Tom girded up his loins, so to speak, and went to work to "get his verses." Sid had learned his lesson days before. Tom bent all his energies to the memorizing of five verses, and he chose part of the Sermon on the Mount, because he could find no verses that were shorter. At the end of half an hour Tom had a vague general idea of his lesson, but no more, for his mind was traversing the whole field of human thought, and his hands were busy with distracting recreations. Mary took his book to hear him recite, and he tried to find his way through the fog:</div>

<div class="line_en">And he did "tackle it again" -- and under the double pressure of curiosity and prospective gain he did it with such spirit that he accomplished a shining success. Mary gave him a brand–new "Barlow" knife worth twelve and a half cents; and the convulsion of delight that swept his system shook him to his foundations. True, the knife would not cut anything, but it was a "sure–enough" Barlow, and there was inconceivable grandeur in that-though where the Western boys ever got the idea that such a weapon could possibly be counterfeited to its injury is an imposing mystery and will always remain so, perhaps. Tom contrived to scarify the cupboard with it, and was arranging to begin on the bureau, when he was called off to dress for Sunday–school.</div>

<div class="line_en">Tom was a trifle disconcerted. The basin was refilled, and this time he stood over it a little while, gathering resolution; took in a big breath and began. When he entered the kitchen presently, with both eyes shut and groping for the towel with his hands, an honorable testimony of suds and water was dripping from his face. But when he emerged from the towel, he was not yet satisfactory, for the clean territory stopped short at his chin and his jaws, like a mask; below and beyond this line there was a dark expanse of unirrigated soil that spread downward in front and backward around his neck. Mary took him in hand, and when she was done with him he was a man and a brother, without distinction of color, and his saturated hair was neatly brushed, and its short curls wrought into a dainty and symmetrical general effect. [He privately smoothed out the curls, with labor and difficulty, and plastered his hair close down to his head; for he held curls to be effeminate, and his own filled his life with bitterness.] Then Mary got out a suit of his clothing that had been used only on Sundays during two years-they were simply called his "other clothes" -- and so by that we know the size of his wardrobe. The girl "put him to rights" after he had dressed himself; she buttoned his neat roundabout up to his chin, turned his vast shirt collar down over his shoulders, brushed him off and crowned him with his speckled straw hat. He now looked exceedingly improved and uncomfortable. He was fully as uncomfortable as he looked; for there was a restraint about whole clothes and cleanliness that galled him. He hoped that Mary would forget his shoes, but the hope was blighted; she coated them thoroughly with tallow, as was the custom, and brought them out. He lost his temper and said he was always being made to do everything he didn't want to do. But Mary said, persuasively:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="汤姆有点不自在。脸盆重新又盛满了水，这一回，他下定决心俯身在脸盆边站了一会，然后深深吸了一口气，就开始洗脸。不久，他走进厨房，闭着眼睛伸手去摸那条毛巾，脸上的肥皂水直往下淌，算是他老老实实洗过脸的证明。可是，当他拿开毛巾，露出脸时，还是不能让人满意。因为洗干净的地方只局限于两腮帮子和下巴上面，看上去像个假面具似的。在下巴以下和腮帮子两旁，还有很大一片没有沾过水，黑乎乎的，从脖子一直往下，往后伸展。玛丽又拉过他来帮他收拾。她把他梳洗打扮完毕之后，他看起来才像个男人，像个兄弟，脸再也不是白一块黑一块了，那湿透了的头发也梳得整整齐齐，短短的卷发还弄成了挺好看的对称样式。（他曾费了很大的劲，偷偷地把满头的鬈发按着，紧紧地贴在头上。因为他认定鬈发总有些女人气，他为自己天生的鬈发十分懊恼。）后来，玛丽把他的一套衣服拿出来，这套衣服已穿了两年，只有星期天才穿——干脆就叫“那套衣服”——由此我们可以知道他的穿戴方面的全部衣物共有多少。他自己穿戴之后，那姑娘又帮他“整理”了一番。她把他那件整洁的上装的衣扣统统扣上，一直扣到下巴底下，又把他那个宽大的衬衣领子往下一翻，搭在两边的肩上，再给他刷得干干净净，戴上他那顶有点点的草帽。这一下子他显得极漂亮，也极不舒服，他看上去一点也不舒服。因为穿上衣服还要保持整洁，对他是种拘束，所以他心里很烦躁。他希望玛丽别让他穿鞋子，可这希望落了空。她按照当时的习惯，先给鞋子抹了一层蜡油，然后拿了出来。他发火了，埋怨别人老是让他干他自己不愿意干的事情，可是，玛丽却劝他道：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mary gave him a tin basin of water and a piece of soap, and he went outside the door and set the basin on a little bench there; then he dipped the soap in the water and laid it down; turned up his sleeves; poured out the water on the ground, gently, and then entered the kitchen and began to wipe his face diligently on the towel behind the door. But Mary removed the towel and said:</div>

<div class="line_en">So he got into the shoes snarling. Mary was soon ready, and the three children set out for Sunday–school-a place that Tom hated with his whole heart; but Sid and Mary were fond of it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是，汤姆一边大喊大叫，一边穿上了那双鞋。玛丽也很快地作好了准备，三个孩子就一块动身去主日学校——那地方是汤姆最深恶痛绝的；但是，希德和玛丽却非常喜欢那里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sabbath–school hours were from nine to half–past ten; and then church service. Two of the children always remained for the sermon voluntarily, and the other always remained too-for stronger reasons. The church's high–backed, uncushioned pews would seat about three hundred persons; the edifice was but a small, plain affair, with a sort of pine board tree–box on top of it for a steeple. At the door Tom dropped back a step and accosted a Sunday–dressed comrade:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="主日学校的上课时间是从9点到10点半；之后，就是做礼拜。他们三个中间有两个总是自觉自愿地留在那儿听牧师布道，而另外一个因为更重要原因也是每次都留下来。教堂里的座位靠背很高，没有垫子，一共可坐三百人。教堂是一座简陋的、规模不大的建筑。屋顶上安了一个松木板做的盒子似的装置当做尖塔。在门口，汤姆故意放慢一步，跟一个穿着星期天服装的同伴打了招呼：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Tom exhibited. They were satisfactory, and the property changed hands. Then Tom traded a couple of white alleys for three red tickets, and some small trifle or other for a couple of blue ones. He waylaid other boys as they came, and went on buying tickets of various colors ten or fifteen minutes longer. He entered the church, now, with a swarm of clean and noisy boys and girls, proceeded to his seat and started a quarrel with the first boy that came handy. The teacher, a grave, elderly man, interfered; then turned his back a moment and Tom pulled a boy's hair in the next bench, and was absorbed in his book when the boy turned around; stuck a pin in another boy, presently, in order to hear him say "Ouch!" and got a new reprimand from his teacher. Tom's whole class were of a pattern-restless, noisy, and troublesome. When they came to recite their lessons, not one of them knew his verses perfectly, but had to be prompted all along. However, they worried through, and each got his reward-in small blue tickets, each with a passage of Scripture on it; each blue ticket was pay for two verses of the recitation. Ten blue tickets equalled a red one, and could be exchanged for it; ten red tickets equalled a yellow one; for ten yellow tickets the superintendent gave a very plainly bound Bible (worth forty cents in those easy times) to the pupil. How many of my readers would have the industry and application to memorize two thousand verses, even for a Dore Bible? And yet Mary had acquired two Bibles in this way-it was the patient work of two years-and a boy of German parentage had won four or five. He once recited three thousand verses without stopping; but the strain upon his mental faculties was too great, and he was little better than an idiot from that day forth-a grievous misfortune for the school, for on great occasions, before company, the superintendent (as Tom expressed it) had always made this boy come out and "spread himself." Only the older pupils managed to keep their tickets and stick to their tedious work long enough to get a Bible, and so the delivery of one of these prizes was a rare and noteworthy circumstance; the successful pupil was so great and conspicuous for that day that on the spot every scholar's heart was fired with a fresh ambition that often lasted a couple of weeks. It is possible that Tom's mental stomach had never really hungered for one of those prizes, but unquestionably his entire being had for many a day longed for the glory and the eclat that came with it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="汤姆就拿出来给他看了。贝利对这两样东西很满意，于是，双方的财物易了主。接着，汤姆用两个白石头子换了三张红票，又用其它一些小玩意换了两张蓝票。当其他的孩子走过来时，汤姆又拦住他们，继续收买各色各样的票。这样换了有十几分钟，汤姆才和一群穿着整齐、吵吵嚷嚷的男孩和女孩一起走进教堂。汤姆走到自己的座位上，和一个离他最近的男孩争吵起来。他们的老师是位面色严肃、上了年纪的人，他叫他俩别闹，然后就转过身去了。汤姆又揪了另一条板凳上一个男孩的头发，那男孩转过头时，他却在全神贯注地在看书。接着为了要听另一个男孩子叫一声“哎唷！”他又用一枚别针扎了他一下，结果被老师臭骂了一顿。汤姆所在的这个班全是一个模式——吵吵闹闹，东捣西戳，一刻不停。他们一起背诵经文时，没有一个能完整记住的，都必须不断地给予提示才行。然而，他们还是勉强过了关，个个都得了奖——蓝色的小纸票，每张票上都印有一段《圣经》上的话。要背两段《圣经》经文才能得这么样一张蓝色纸票。十张蓝色票等于一张红色票，也可以互换。十张红色票又可以换一张黄色票。如果得了十张黄色票，校长就奖励给这个学生一本简装的《圣经》（在当初日子好过的那个时候，值4角钱）。我亲爱的读者们当中，有多少人肯这么用功，费劲去背上两千段《圣经》经文来换取一本多莱版的《圣经》呢？然而玛丽却用这种方法得了两本《圣经》——那可是两年之久的耐心学习的代价——还有一个德国血统的男孩得了四五本。他曾一下子背诵了三千段《圣经》。可是由于他脑力的过度劳累，自此以后差不多成了一个白痴——这是主日学校的重大不幸，因为每逢盛大的场面，在许多来宾面前（据汤姆的讲法），校长总是叫这个男孩出来“露一手”。只有那些年龄大的学生才坚持努力用功，想法得票，为的是获取一本《圣经》。所以，每次颁发这种奖品都是件稀罕而轰动的大事。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In due course the superintendent stood up in front of the pulpit, with a closed hymn–book in his hand and his forefinger inserted between its leaves, and commanded attention. When a Sunday–school superintendent makes his customary little speech, a hymn–book in the hand is as necessary as is the inevitable sheet of music in the hand of a singer who stands forward on the platform and sings a solo at a concert -- though why, is a mystery: for neither the hymn–book nor the sheet of music is ever referred to by the sufferer. This superintendent was a slim creature of thirty–five, with a sandy goatee and short sandy hair; he wore a stiff standing–collar whose upper edge almost reached his ears and whose sharp points curved forward abreast the corners of his mouth-a fence that compelled a straight lookout ahead, and a turning of the whole body when a side view was required; his chin was propped on a spreading cravat which was as broad and as long as a bank–note, and had fringed ends; his boot toes were turned sharply up, in the fashion of the day, like sleigh–runners-an effect patiently and laboriously produced by the young men by sitting with their toes pressed against a wall for hours together. Mr. Walters was very earnest of mien, and very sincere and honest at heart; and he held sacred things and places in such reverence, and so separated them from worldly matters, that unconsciously to himself his Sunday–school voice had acquired a peculiar intonation which was wholly absent on week–days. He began after this fashion:</div>

That is the way good little boys and girls should do. I see one little girl who is looking out of the window-I am afraid she thinks I am out there somewhere-perhaps up in one of the trees making a speech to the little birds. [Applausive titter.] I want to tell you how good it makes me feel to see so many bright, clean little faces assembled in a place like this, learning to do right and be good." And so forth and so on. It is not necessary to set down the rest of the oration. It was of a pattern which does not vary, and so it is familiar to us all.</div>

<div class="line_en">The latter third of the speech was marred by the resumption of fights and other recreations among certain of the bad boys, and by fidgetings and whisperings that extended far and wide, washing even to the bases of isolated and incorruptible rocks like Sid and Mary.

<div class="line_en">A good part of the whispering had been occasioned by an event which was more or less rare-the entrance of visitors: lawyer Thatcher, accompanied by a very feeble and aged man; a fine, portly, middle–aged gentleman with iron–gray hair; and a dignified lady who was doubtless the latter's wife. The lady was leading a child. Tom had been restless and full of chafings and repinings; conscience–smitten, too-he could not meet Amy Lawrence's eye, he could not brook her loving gaze. But when he saw this small new–comer his soul was all ablaze with bliss in a moment. The next moment he was "showing off" with all his might -- cuffing boys, pulling hair, making faces-in a word, using every art that seemed likely to fascinate a girl and win her applause. His exaltation had but one alloy-the memory of his humiliation in this angel's garden-and that record in sand was fast washing out, under the waves of happiness that were sweeping over it now.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="刚才那阵子的窃窃私语主要是由一件多少有些稀罕的事情引起的——那就是来了几位来访者：有撒切尔律师，他由一个非常衰弱的老人陪伴；一位文雅、肥胖、满头铁灰色头发的中年绅士；还有一位贵夫人，她无疑是那位绅士的太太。这位夫人手里还牵着一个小孩。汤姆心里一直很不安，心里充满了烦恼和忧愁；而且还受到良心的谴责——他不敢正视艾美·劳伦斯的眼睛，她那含情的注目简直使他受不了。可是当他看见这位新来的小女孩，他的心里立刻燃起了幸福的火焰。接着他就拚命地卖弄炫耀——打别人的耳光，揪头发，做鬼脸——总而言之，凡是可能引起女孩注意，获取她欢心和赞赏的把戏，他都用了。想到在这个小天使家花园受到的那种非人的待遇，他高兴的劲头凉了一截，不过快得就像留在沙滩上的印迹一样，被幸福的浪潮一冲，就被冲得一干二净。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The visitors were given the highest seat of honor, and as soon as Mr. Walters' speech was finished, he introduced them to the school. The middle–aged man turned out to be a prodigious personage-no less a one than the county judge-altogether the most august creation these children had ever looked upon-and they wondered what kind of material he was made of-and they half wanted to hear him roar, and were half afraid he might, too. He was from Constantinople, twelve miles away-so he had travelled, and seen the world-these very eyes had looked upon the county court–house-which was said to have a tin roof. The awe which these reflections inspired was attested by the impressive silence and the ranks of staring eyes. This was the great Judge Thatcher, brother of their own lawyer. Jeff Thatcher immediately went forward, to be familiar with the great man and be envied by the school. It would have been music to his soul to hear the whisperings:</div>

<div class="line_en">Mr. Walters fell to "showing off," with all sorts of official bustlings and activities, giving orders, delivering judgments, discharging directions here, there, everywhere that he could find a target. The librarian "showed off" -- running hither and thither with his arms full of books and making a deal of the splutter and fuss that insect authority delights in. The young lady teachers "showed off" -- bending sweetly over pupils that were lately being boxed, lifting pretty warning fingers at bad little boys and patting good ones lovingly. The young gentlemen teachers "showed off" with small scoldings and other little displays of authority and fine attention to discipline-and most of the teachers, of both sexes, found business up at the library, by the pulpit; and it was business that frequently had to be done over again two or three times (with much seeming vexation). The little girls "showed off" in various ways, and the little boys "showed off" with such diligence that the air was thick with paper wads and the murmur of scufflings. And above it all the great man sat and beamed a majestic judicial smile upon all the house, and warmed himself in the sun of his own grandeur-for he was "showing off," too.</div>

<div class="line_en">And now at this moment, when hope was dead, Tom Sawyer came forward with nine yellow tickets, nine red tickets, and ten blue ones, and demanded a Bible. This was a thunderbolt out of a clear sky. Walters was not expecting an application from this source for the next ten years. But there was no getting around it-here were the certified checks, and they were good for their face. Tom was therefore elevated to a place with the Judge and the other elect, and the great news was announced from headquarters. It was the most stunning surprise of the decade, and so profound was the sensation that it lifted the new hero up to the judicial one's altitude, and the school had two marvels to gaze upon in place of one. The boys were all eaten up with envy-but those that suffered the bitterest pangs were those who perceived too late that they themselves had contributed to this hated splendor by trading tickets to Tom for the wealth he had amassed in selling whitewashing privileges. These despised themselves, as being the dupes of a wily fraud, a guileful snake in the grass.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="希望眼看就要落空了，就在这个时候，汤姆·索亚却走上前来，手里拿着九张黄票、九张红票和十张蓝票，请求得到一本《圣经》。这真是晴天霹雳。再过十年，华尔特先生也不会料想竟是这个宝贝来提出申请。可是又无法推脱——票面都不假，按照规定都该是有效的。于是，汤姆有幸与法官和其他几位贵宾们坐在一起，这个重大的消息就从首脑席上公布于众了。这是十年来最令人吃惊的事情，全场大为轰动，把这位新英雄的地位抬高得和法官老爷相等。这下子学校的人们瞪着眼睛看的是两位而不是一位了不起的人物了。男孩子们更是忌妒得咬牙切齿——可是最懊悔的还是那些用背《圣经》得来的条子跟汤姆换他出卖刷墙特权时所积攒下的财宝的孩子们。为了汤姆这些宝贝玩意，他们给了汤姆这些条子，这帮了他大忙，使他获得了这种令人气愤的荣誉。可是，现在才发现，后悔已经晚了。这些孩子们现在才明白他们的对手是个诡计多端的骗子，是一条藏在草里狡诈的蛇，而他们自己却是上了当的大傻瓜，因此他们都觉得自惭形秽。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The prize was delivered to Tom with as much effusion as the superintendent could pump up under the circumstances; but it lacked somewhat of the true gush, for the poor fellow's instinct taught him that there was a mystery here that could not well bear the light, perhaps; it was simply preposterous that this boy had warehoused two thousand sheaves of Scriptural wisdom on his premises-a dozen would strain his capacity, without a doubt.</div>
