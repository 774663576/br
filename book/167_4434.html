<div class="line_en">Bran preferred the hard stone of the window seat to the comforts of his featherbed and blankets. Abed, the walls pressed close and the ceiling hung heavy above him; abed, the room was his cell, and Winterfell his prison. Yet outside his window, the wide world still called.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布兰喜欢窗边坚硬的石座椅，远胜温暖舒适的羽床毛毯。躺在床上，四壁朝他压迫而来，沉重的天花板悬在头顶；躺在床上，卧室是他的牢房，临冬城是他的监狱。然而在窗外，广大的世界依旧呼唤着他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Summer's howls were long and sad, full of grief and longing. Shaggydog's were more savage. Their voices echoed through the yards and halls until the castle rang and it seemed as though some great pack of direwolves haunted Winterfell, instead of only two… two where there had once been six. Do they miss their brothers and sisters too? Bran wondered. Are they calling to Grey Wind and Ghost, to Nymeria and Lady's Shade? Do they want them to come home and be a pack together?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="夏天的叫声绵长而哀戚，充满悲伤与思慕，毛毛狗则较具野性。它们的嚎叫回荡在广场上、厅堂里，充绕全城，好似有大群冰原狼盘据临冬城，而不只区区两只…原本的六只，如今只剩下这两个。他们也在想念兄弟姐妹吗？布兰很想知道，他们是在呼唤灰风和白灵，呼唤娜梅莉亚和淑女的鬼魂吗？他们是否也希望兄弟姐妹们早日回家、重新团聚呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He could not walk, nor climb nor hunt nor fight with a wooden sword as once he had, but he could still look. He liked to watch the windows begin to glow all over Winterfell as candles and hearth fires were lit behind the diamond-shaped panes of tower and hall, and he loved to listen to the direwolves sing to the stars.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽然他不能行走，不能攀爬，不能打猎，不能像以前一样拿木剑练习，但他可以“看”。他喜欢坐在窗前，看着远方钻石形玻璃窗棂里的蜡烛和炉火逐一点燃，照遍临冬城的塔楼和厅堂；他也喜欢听冰原狼群对着星空歌唱。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Of late, he often dreamed of wolves. They are talking to me, brother to brother, he told himself when the direwolves howled. He could almost understand them… not quite, not truly, but almost… as if they were singing in a language he had once known and somehow forgotten. The Walders might be scared of them, but the Starks had wolf blood. Old Nan told him so. "Though it is stronger in some than in others," she warned.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="近来，他时常梦见狼。他们把我当成兄弟，在对我说话啊，每当他听见冰原狼的叫声，便这么告诉自己。他几乎能听懂它们的话…并非全懂，也非真懂，好像就差那么一点…彷佛它们歌唱的语言他曾经通晓，只是暂时遗忘。大小瓦德怕它们，然而史塔克家人体内流的是奔狼的血液，老奶妈说过的。“虽然每个族人身上的狼血并不等量，”她还告诫。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Who can know the mind of a wolf?" Ser Rodrik Cassel said when Bran asked him why they howled. Bran's lady mother had named him castellan of Winterfell in her absence, and his duties left him little time for idle questions.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“谁知道狼想些什么？”当布兰向罗德利克·凯索爵士问起狼嚎的原因时，他这么回答。布兰的母亲大人南下之前，任命罗德利克爵士为代理城主，因此他身负重任，无暇闲话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"They want to hunt," agreed Gage the cook as he tossed cubes of suet in a great kettle of stew. "A wolf smells better'n any man. Like as not, they've caught the scent o' prey."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“它们想打猎。”大厨盖奇一边把板油块丢进大汤锅，一边说，“狼的嗅觉比人灵敏得多，他们八成是闻到猎物的气味了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's freedom they're calling for," declared Farlen, who was kennelmaster and had no more love for the direwolves than his hounds did. "They don't like being walled up, and who's to blame them? Wild things belong in the wild, not in a castle."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他们在呼唤自由。”法兰表示，他是临冬城的驯兽长，和他管的猎犬一样对冰原狼没好感。“它们不喜欢被关起来，这能怪谁呢？野东西本该待在野外，而不是圈在城里。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Maester Luwin did not think so. "Wolves often howl at the moon. These are howling at the comet. See how bright it is, Bran? Perchance they think it is the moon."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="鲁温学士却不这么认为：“狼时常对月长嚎，他们现在是对着那颗彗星叫。布兰，你看它有多亮？他们想必把彗星当成了月亮。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When Bran repeated that to Osha, she laughed aloud. "Your wolves have more wit than your maester," the wildling woman said. "They know truths the grey man has forgotten." The way she said it made him shiver, and when he asked what the comet meant, she answered, "Blood and fire, boy, and nothing sweet."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布兰把这番话告诉欧莎，她听了却哈哈大笑。“你们家学士还没那两只狼聪明，”女野人说，“有些事灰老头忘了，他们可记得很清楚。”听她这么一说，他不禁全身发抖，连问她彗星所代表的意义，她回答道，“小子，就是血与火，没什么好事。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Though Old Nan did not think so, and she'd lived longer than any of them. "Dragons," she said, lifting her head and sniffing. She was near blind and could not see the comet, yet she claimed she could smell it. "It be dragons, boy," she insisted. Bran got no princes from Nan, no more than he ever had.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="老奶妈却不以为然可老奶妈却不以为然，而她的年纪比谁都大。“是龙，”她边说边抬头，嗅了两下。她的眼睛已经快瞎，无法看到彗星，然而她宣称自己闻得到。“那是龙啊，孩子。”她坚持。老奶妈始终不曾称呼布兰为“王子”，过去如此，现在依然。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And still the direwolves howled. The guards on the walls muttered curses, hounds in the kennels barked furiously, horses kicked at their stalls, the Walders shivered by their fire, and even Maester Luwin complained of sleepless nights. Only Bran did not mind. Ser Rodrik had confined the wolves to the godswood after Shaggydog bit Little Walder, but the stones of Winterfell played queer tricks with sound, and sometimes it sounded as if they were in the yard right below Bran's window. Other times he would have sworn they were up on the curtain walls, loping round like sentries. He wished that he could see them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="冰原狼依旧日夜号叫不止。城上的守卫低声咒骂，兽栏的猎犬怒声狂吠，马儿猛踢马厩，瓦德兄弟在火边颤抖，就连鲁温学士也抱怨晚上睡不好，唯独布兰不以为意。自从毛毛狗咬伤小瓦德之后，罗德利克爵士便把两只狼关在神木林里，可是临冬城的石墙会拿声音变戏法，有时候，他们彷佛就在布兰窗户下方的广场上，有时候，他敢发誓他们有如守卫一般在城墙上来回游走。他好想看看它们。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Bran asked Septon Chayle about the comet while they were sorting through some scrolls snatched from the library fire. "It is the sword that slays the season," he replied, and soon after the white raven came from Oldtown bringing word of autumn, so doubtless he was right.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="关于彗星的含意，先前布兰帮柴尔修士整理从藏书塔大火中抢救出来的卷轴时，也向他问起过。“那是斩杀季节的剑。”他这么回答。没过多久，白鸦便从旧镇带来秋天来临的消息，所以他说的肯定没错。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He could see the comet hanging above the Guards Hall and the Bell Tower, and farther back the First Keep, squat and round, its gargoyles black shapes against the bruised purple dusk. Once Bran had known every stone of those buildings, inside and out; he had climbed them all, scampering up walls as easily as other boys ran down stairs. Their rooftops had been his secret places, and the crows atop the broken tower his special friends.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他时时注意到高挂在守卫室、钟塔以及更远处首堡上空的彗星，圆形的首堡十分低矮，石像鬼黑色的身形衬着远方紫红的天幕。曾经，布兰对这些建筑的里里外外、一砖一瓦都了若指掌，因为他全都爬过。他爬起墙来就像别的男孩跑楼梯那么轻松自如。过去，城楼的屋顶是他的秘密基地，残塔顶的乌鸦是他的知心朋友。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Bran did not remember falling, yet they said he had, so he supposed it must be true. He had almost died. When he saw the weatherworn gargoyles atop the First Keep where it had happened, he got a queer tight feeling in his belly. And now he could not climb, nor walk nor run nor swordfight, and the dreams he'd dreamed of knighthood had soured in his head.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布兰不记得自己坠楼，但他们都这么说，所以他想应该确有其事。他差点就没命了呢。每当他见到意外发生的首堡塔顶那些历经风吹雨打的石像鬼雕像，便觉腹部奇异的一紧。如今他不能攀爬、不能行走，、不能奔跑、不能练剑，曾经的骑士梦已经灰飞烟灭。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Summer had howled the day Bran had fallen, and for long after as he lay broken in his bed; Robb had told him so before he went away to war. Summer had mourned for him, and Shaggydog and Grey Wind had joined in his grief. And the night the bloody raven had brought word of their father's death, the wolves had known that too. Bran had been in the maester's turret with Rickon talking of the children of the forest when Summer and Shaggydog had drowned out Luwin with their howls.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="罗柏离城出征以前，对布兰说过：他坠楼那天，夏天长嚎不止，之后他卧病在床期间，也依旧嚎叫不息。夏天为他哀悼，毛毛狗和灰风齐声加入悲鸣。而浑身浴血的信鸦捎来父亲死讯的那天夜里，狼群彷佛也知道了。当时布兰和瑞肯正在学士的塔楼上，讨论森林之子的种种故事，夏天和毛毛狗却突然仰天长嚎，淹没了鲁温的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">If I were truly a direwolf, I would understand the song, he thought wistfully. In his wolf dreams, he could race up the sides of mountains, jagged icy mountains taller than any tower, and stand at the summit beneath the full moon with all the world below him, the way it used to be.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="假如我变成冰原狼，我就能懂得他们的歌唱，他满心期盼地想。在他的狼梦里，他总会飞奔登上比任何塔楼都要陡峭的冰雪峰峦，昂首立于山巅，满月临空，俯瞰一切，每次都是这样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Who are they mourning now? Had some enemy slain the King in the North, who used to be his brother Robb? Had his bastard brother Jon Snow fallen from the Wall? Had his mother died, or one of his sisters? Or was this something else, as maester and septon and Old Nan seemed to think?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="而今，它们又为谁哀悼呢？莫非有人杀了那个曾是他哥哥罗柏的北境之王？莫非他私生子哥哥琼恩失足跌落长城？莫非母亲或两个姐姐出了意外？甚或别的事，就如学士、修士和老奶妈想的那些？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oooo," Bran cried tentatively. He cupped his hands around his mouth and lifted his head to the comet. "Ooooooooooooooooooo, ahooooooooooooooo," he howled. It sounded stupid, high and hollow and quavering, a little boy's howl, not a wolf's. Yet Summer gave answer, his deep voice drowning out Bran's thin one, and Shaggydog made it a chorus. Bran haroooed again. They howled together, last of their pack.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“呜呜呜～”布兰试着双手围住嘴巴，举头朝彗星呼叫，“呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜～”他嚎道，声音是那么笨拙，尖锐、空洞而颤抖，这只是小男孩的号叫，绝非狼吼。然而夏天却遥相应和，浑厚的声音盖过布兰的细微呐喊，接着，毛毛狗也加入进来。布兰再度开口，与之齐声高喊，好似一群伙伴。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我自己能上床。”密肯在墙上钉了一排铁把手，好让布兰可以用手在房间里活动。虽然行动迟缓又辛苦，而且使肩膀痛得要命，但他讨厌被人抱来抱去。“而且，我现在不想睡。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The game was played with a log, a staff, a body of water, and a great deal of shouting. The water was the most important, Walder and Walder assured Bran. You could use a plank or even a series of stones, and a branch could be your staff. You didn't have to shout. But without water, there was no game. As Maester Luwin and Ser Rodrik were not about to let the children go wandering off into the wolfswood in search of a stream, they made do with one of the murky pools in the godswood. Walder and Walder had never seen hot water bubbling from the ground before, but they both allowed how it would make the game even better.</div>

<div class="line_en">The way their game was played, you laid the log across the water, and one player stood in the middle with the stick. He was the lord of the crossing, and when one of the other players came up, he had to say, "I am the lord of the crossing, who goes there?" And the other player had to make up a speech about who they were and why they should be allowed to cross. The lord could make them swear oaths and answer questions. They didn't have to tell the truth, but the oaths were binding unless they said "Mayhaps," so the trick was to say "Mayhaps" so the lord of the crossing didn't notice. Then you could try and knock the lord into the water and you got to be lord of the crossing, but only if you'd said "Mayhaps." Otherwise you were out of the game. The lord got to knock anyone in the water anytime he pleased, and he was the only one who got to use a stick.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="游戏进行的方式是把树干放在水面上，然后一个玩家手持木棍站在上面，扮作河渡口领主，每当其他玩家靠近，他就说：“我乃河渡口领主，来者何人？”被问的玩家得编出一套说词，说明自己的来历，以及为什么该让他过河。领主可以命令他们赌咒发誓或回答问题，但他们不一定得说实话，只有所发的誓具有约束力，除非他们在誓言中说：“也许”。所以这游戏的诀窍就是趁河渡口领主没注意的情况下说“也许”，然后就可以试着把领主打进河里，自己来当掌管河渡口，可一定要说了“也许”才行，否则就判犯规出局。而当领主的人只要高兴，随时可以把人打进水中，也只有他能用棍子。">查看中文翻译</div>
