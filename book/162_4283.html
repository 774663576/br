<div class="line_en">Anchise was waiting for me at the station. I spotted him as soon as the train made its prolonged curve around the bay, slowing down and almost grazing the tall cypresses that I loved so much and through which I always caught an ever-welcoming preview of the glaring midafternoon sea. I lowered the window and let the wind fan my face, catching a glimpse of our lumbering engine car far, far ahead. Arriving in B. always made me happy. It reminded me of arrivals in early June at the end of every school year. The wind, the heat, the glinting gray platform with the ancient stationmaster's hut permanently shuttered since the First World War, the dead silence, all spelled my favorite season at this deserted and beloved time of day. Summer was just about to start, it seemed, things hadn't happened yet, my head was still buzzing with last-minute cramming before exams, this was the first time I was sighting the sea this year. Oliver who?</div>

<div class="line_en">Within minutes of my arrival, the direttissimo to Rome swished in on the opposite track -- always punctual, that train. Three days ago, we had taken the exact same one. I remembered now staring from its windows and thinking: In a few days, you'll be back, and you'll be alone, and you'll hate it, so don't let anything catch you unprepared. Be warned. I had rehearsed losing him not just to ward off suffering by taking it in small doses beforehand, but, as all superstitious people do, to see if my willingness to accept the very worst might not induce fate to soften its blow. Like soldiers trained to fight by night, I lived in the dark so as not to be blinded when darkness came. Rehearse the pain to dull the pain. Homeopathically.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在我抵达几分钟后，往罗马的快车滑入对向的轨道——那班火车一向准时。三天前，我们搭的正是这同一班车。我想起当时我边向窗外看边想：再过几天你就会回来，你将是一个人，你会恨透了那感觉，所以千万别让任何东西乘虚而入。要警醒。我预演失去他的处境，不只是为了事前一点一点接受，好抵挡痛苦，也像迷信的人，想看看如果我愿意接受最糟的状况，命运会不会减轻打击的力道。我像为打夜战而受训的士兵，生活在黑暗中，以免黑暗骤降，不能视物。预演痛苦来抑制痛苦。依顺势疗法的道理。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I always knew I'd eventually have my room back. But I had hoped for a slower, more extended transition to the way things used to be before Oliver. I'd pictured lying in bed struggling to work up the courage to make it across to his room. What I had failed to anticipate was that Mafalda would have already changed his sheets -- our sheets. Luckily I'd asked him again to give me Billowy that morning, after I'd made sure he wore it all through our stay in Rome. I had put it in a plastic laundry bag in our hotel room and would in all likelihood have to hide it from anyone's prying reach for the rest of my life. On certain nights, I'd remove Billowy from its bag, make sure it hadn't acquired the scent of plastic or of my clothes, and hold it next to me, flap its long sleeves around me, and breathe out his name in the dark. Ulliva, Ulliva, Ulliva -- it was Oliver calling me by his name when he'd imitate its transmogrified sound as spoken by Mafalda and Anchise; but it'd also be me calling him by his name as well, hoping he'd call me back by mine, which I'd speak for him to me, and back to him: Elio, Elio, Elio.</div>

<div class="line_en">To avoid entering my bedroom from the balcony and finding him missing, I used the inner stairwell. I opened the door to my room, dropped my backpack on the floor, and threw myself on my warm, sunlit bed. Thank goodness for that. They had not washed the bedspread. Suddenly I was happy to be back. I could have fallen asleep right then and there, forgetting all about Billowy and the smell, and about Oliver himself. Who can resist sleep at two or three in the afternoon in these sunlit parts of the Mediterranean?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="为了避免从阳台进入我的卧房，我走室内楼梯上楼。我打开我房间的门，把背包丢在地上，将自己扔到晒得到阳光的温暖床上。谢天谢地，她们没洗床罩。我突然很高兴自己回来了。我说不定转眼间就能睡着，忘记大波浪衬衫和那股气味，以及奥利弗的一切。谁能抗拒在地中海日照地区午后的两三点睡上一觉？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In my exhaustion, I resolved to take out my scorebook later in the afternoon and pick up the Haydn exactly where I'd left off. Either this or I'd head over to the tennis courts and sit in the sun on one of those warm benches that were sure to send a shiver of well-being through my body, and see who was available for a game. There was always someone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="累坏的我，决定下午晚一点要拿出海顿乐谱，从中断的小节继续改编。不然，我要去网球场，坐在一张温暖的板凳上晒太阳（这么做铁定让我幸福到全身打哆嗦），看看谁有空跟我比赛。随时都有人的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I had never welcomed sleep so serenely in my life. There'd be plenty of time for mourning, I thought. It will come, probably on the sly, as I've heard these things always do, and there won't be any getting off lightly, either. Anticipating sorrow to neutralize sorrow -- that's paltry, cowardly stuff, I told myself, knowing I was an ace practitioner of the craft. And what if it came fiercely? What if it came and didn't let go, a sorrow that had come to stay, and did to me what longing for him had done on those nights when it seemed there was something so essential missing from my life that it might as well have been missing from my body, so that losing him now would be like losing a hand you could spot in every picture of yourself around the house, but without which you couldn't possibly be you again. You lose it, as you always knew you would, and were even prepared to; but you can't bring yourself to live with the loss. And hoping not to think of it, like praying not to dream of it, hurts just the same.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我这辈子从未如此平静地欢迎睡意。要哀悼有的是时间。它会悄悄来到，它一向如此，而且也没有任何从轻发落的可能。预期哀伤，好缓和哀伤——明知我是这门技艺的头号实践者，我仍告诉自己，那是没价值又怯懦的勾当。如果它来势汹汹怎么办？如果它来了又不肯松手怎么办？停驻不去的哀伤，像那些夜晚对他的渴望所带来的影响，似乎有什么根本的东西从我的生命中佚失，从我的身体消失，以致现在失去他，就像失去自己的手。那是屋里每张照片里的自己都有的手，但少了这只手，你就不可能再是你。你失去它，就像你一向知道你会失去，甚至做好了准备；但你无法让自己忍受这个失落。希望别去想它，祈祷不要梦到它，然而伤痛依旧。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In the middle of the afternoon, I became aware that I was enjoying sleep, and not just seeking refuge in it -- sleep within sleep, like dreams within dreams, could anything be better? An access of something as exquisite as pure bliss began to take hold of me. This must be Wednesday, I thought, and indeed it was Wednesday, when the cutlery grinder sets up shop in our courtyard and begins to hone every blade in the household, Mafalda always chatting him up as she stands next to him, holding a glass of lemonade for him while he plies away at the whetstone. The raspy, fricative sound of his wheel crackling and hissing in the midafternoon heat, sending sound waves of bliss up my way to my bedroom. I had never been able to admit to myself how happy Oliver had made me the day he'd swallowed my peach. Of course it had moved me, but it had flattered me as well, as though his gesture had said, I believe with every cell in my body that every cell in yours must not, must never, die, and if it does have to die, let it die inside my body. He'd unlatched the partly opened door to the balcony from the outside, stepped in -- we weren't quite on speaking terms that day; he didn't ask if he could come in. What was I going to do? Say, You can't come in? This was when I raised my arm to greet him and tell him I was done pouting, no more pouting, ever, and let him lift the sheets and get into my bed. Now, no sooner had I heard the sound of the whetstone amid the cicadas than I knew I'd either wake up or go on sleeping, and both were good, dreaming or sleeping, one and the same, I'd take either or both.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="下午三四点，我意识到我正在享受睡眠，而不只是在睡梦中寻求庇护。睡眠中的睡眠，就像梦中梦，还有什么更好的？一种得以接近与纯粹幸福同样精致的情绪控制住我。这天一定是星期三，想。这天也确实是星期三，因为磨刀机正式开张，开始磨家里每一片刀刃，一旁的玛法尔达总会跟他聊天，在他用磨刀石磨刀时，替他拿着一杯柠檬汁。机械在午后三四点的热气中发出啪啪啪与嘶嘶嘶的刺耳摩擦声，将幸福的声波送进我卧房来。我一直无法对自己承认，奥利弗把我那颗桃子吞下去那天，他让我多么快乐。当然我很感动，但我也觉得受宠若惊，仿佛他的举动已经表明：我身上的每个细胞都相信，你身上的每个细胞都不该，永远不该死。如果非死不可，请让它死在我体内吧。通往阳台的那扇门半开着，他从外面拉开门门走进来（那天我们没什么交谈的意愿）；他没问能不能进来。我该怎么办？难道要说不准他进来？就是此时，我举起双臂迎接他，告诉他我气消了，而且再也不生气，绝对不会，让他掀开被单爬上我的床。这时，我一听到夹杂着磨刀石声的蝉鸣就知道我可以醒来，或继续睡，两者都好。做梦或睡觉，都一样，我会任选一种或两种都做。">查看中文翻译</div>

I knew that he was filled with grief when he finally kissed me one last time in one of the bathroom stalls at Fiumicino Airport and that, even if on the plane the drinks and the movie had distracted him, once alone in his room in New York, he too would be sad again, and I hated thinking of him sad, just as I knew he'd hate to see me sad in our bedroom, which had all too soon become my bedroom.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was after dinner when the phone rang. Oliver had arrived safely. Yes, in New York. Yes, same apartment, same people, same noise -- unfortunately the same music streaming from outside the window -- you could hear it now. He put the receiver out the window and allowed us to get a flavor of the Hispanic rhythms of New York. One Hundred and Fourteenth Street, he said. Going out to a late lunch with friends. My mother and father were both talking to him from separate phones in the living room. I was on the phone in the kitchen. Here? Well, you know. The usual dinner guests. Just left. Yes, very, very hot here too. My father hoped this had been productive.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="晚餐后电话铃响。奥利弗平安抵达。对，在纽约。对，同样的公寓，同样的人，同样的噪音——很不幸，同样的音乐从窗外飘进来，你现在听到了。他把听筒伸出窗外，让我们感受一下纽约西班牙韵律的风味。一百一十四街，他说。要跟朋友去吃一顿迟来的午餐。我的父母双双在客厅分别用不同的电话与他通话。我用的是厨房的电话。这里？嗯，你也知道啊。像平常一样的晚餐宾客。刚走。对，这里也非常、非常热。父亲希望这对生产力有帮助。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This? Staying with us, explained my father. Best thing in my life. If I could, I'd hop on the same plane and come with the shirt on my back, an extra bathing suit, a toothbrush. Everyone laughed. With open arms, cam. Jokes were being bandied back and forth. You know our tradition, explained my mother, you must always come back, even for a few days. Even for a few days meant for no more than a few days -- but she'd meant what she said, and he knew it. "Allora ciao, Oliver, e a presto," she said. My father more or less repeated the same words, then added, "Dunque, ti passo Elio -- vi lascio." I heard the clicks of both extension phones signal that no one else was on the line. How tactful of my father. But the all-too-sudden freedom to be alone across what seemed a time barrier froze me. Did he have a good trip? Yes. Did he hate the meal? Yes. Did he think of me? I had run out of questions and should have thought better than to keep pounding him with more. "What do you think?" was his vague answer -- as if fearing someone might accidentally pick up the receiver? Vimini sends her love. Very upset. I'll go out and buy her something tomorrow and send it by express mail. I'll never forget Rome so long as I live. Me neither. Do you like your room? Sort of. Window facing noisy courtyard, never any sun, hardly any room for anything, didn't know I owned so many books, bed way too small now. Wish we could start all over in that room, I said. Both leaning out the window in the evening, rubbing shoulders, as we did in Rome -- every day of my life, I said. Every day of mine too. Shirt, toothbrush, score, and I'm flying over, so don't tempt me either. I took something from your room, he said. What? You'll never guess. What? Find out for yourself. And then I said it, not because it was what I wanted to say to him but because the silence was weighing on us, and this was the easiest thing to smuggle in during a pause -- and at least I would have said it: I don't want to lose you. We would write. I'd call from the post office -- more private that way. There was talk of Christmas, of Thanksgiving even. Yes, Christmas. But his world, which until then seemed no more distant from mine than by the thickness of the skin Chiara had once picked from his shoulders, had suddenly drifted light-years away. By Christmas it might not matter. Let me hear the noise from your window one last time. I heard crackle. Let me hear the sound you made when… A faint, timid sound -- on account of because there were others in the house, he said. It made us laugh. Besides, they're waiting for me to go out with them. I wished he had never called. I had wanted to hear him say my name again. I had meant to ask him, now that we were far apart, what ever had happened between him and Chiara. I had also forgotten to ask where he'd put his red bathing suit. Probably he had forgotten and taken it away with him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这”指的是？跟我们一起住啊。父亲解释道。我这辈子最棒的事。如果可能，我想套件衬衫，外加一件泳裤和一支牙刷，跳上同一班飞机回去。大家都笑了。我们展开双臂欢迎，亲爱的。笑话一来一往。你知道我们家的传统，母亲解释道，你一定要常常回来，即使只待几天。“即使只待几天”的意思就只是几天——但她是真心的，奥利弗也知道。“那拜拜了，奥利弗，希望很快再见到你。”她说。父亲大致重复了相同的话，然后补上一句：“那么，我让艾里奥跟你聊喽”我听到两支电话分机挂上的咔嚓声，这表示线上没有别人了。父亲多么圆融啊。但跨越似乎是时间的障碍，太过突然地享有独处的自由，令我呆在那里。他旅途还顺利吗？顺利。餐点他讨厌吗？讨厌。他想我吗？我没有问题可问了，而且应该想出比拿更多问题轰炸他更好的方法。“你想呢？”是他含混的答案。他怕不小心有人拿起话筒？薇米妮向你问好。非常沮丧。我明天会出门替她买东西，然后用快递寄给她。只要我活着，就不会忘记罗马。我也是。你喜欢你的房间吗？还算喜欢。窗户面对嘈杂的院子，从来没有一丝阳光，几乎放不了什么东西，以前不知道我有这么多书，现在床太小了。希望我们能在那个房间重新开始，我说。一起在傍晚时探出窗外，摩擦着肩膀，就像我们在罗马时一样——一辈子天天如此，我说。我也是。带着衬衫、牙刷、乐谱，我就能飞过去，所以也别引诱我。我从你房间带走一样东西，他说。是什么？你绝对猜不到。是什么？自己找找看。然后我说了——那并非我想对他说的话，然而沉默重重压迫我们，这是停顿时刻最容易偷渡的东西。至少我说出口了：我不想失去你。我们会通信。我会从邮局打电话给你——那样比较隐秘。我们谈到圣诞节，甚至谈到感恩节。好，圣诞节。在这之前，他的世界和我的世界之间的距离，原本似乎比不上奇亚拉曾经从他肩上撕起的那块皮那么厚，然而此时他的世界却飘到数光年之外那么远，圣诞节前可能没关系。最后一次，再让我听听你窗外的噪音。我听到劈啪声。让我听听你那时发出的声…一阵模糊、胆怯的声音——因为屋里有别人，他说。我们因此笑了。朋友正在等我一起出门。我希望他没打这通电话来。原本我想再听他唤我的名字。既然我们分隔这么远，我原本想问他和奇亚拉之间究竟怎么了。我也忘了问他把红色泳裤放在哪里。或许他忘记要给我，带走了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Someone was coming toward the rocks. I tried to think of something to dispel my sorrow and fell upon the ironic fact that the distance separating Vimini from me was exactly the same that separated me from Oliver. Seven years.

<div class="line_en">The first thing I did after our telephone conversation was go up to my room and see what he could possibly have taken that would remind him of me. Then I saw the unyellowed blank spot on the wall. Bless him. He had taken a framed, antique postcard of Monet's berm dating back to 1905 or so. One of our previous American summer residents had fished it out in a flee market in Paris two years ago and had mailed it to me as a souvenir. The faded colored postcard had originally been mailed in 1914-- there were a few hasty, sepia-toned scribbles in German script on the back, addressed to a doctor in England, next to which the American student had inscribed his own greetings to me in black ink -- Think of me someday. The picture would remind Oliver of the morning when I first spoke out. Or of the day when we rode by the berm pretending not to notice it. Or of that day we'd decided to picnic there and had vowed not to touch each other, the better to enjoy lying in bed together the same afternoon. I wanted him to have the picture before his eyes for all time, his whole life, in front of his desk, of his bed, everywhere. Nail it everywhere you go, I thought.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="通过电话之后，我先回房间看看他可能带走什么能让他想起我的东西。我看到墙上有一块未发黄的空白。愿上帝祝福他。他拿走一幅1905年前后印制，裱了框的莫奈崖径古董明信片。那是我们早先一位美国夏季住客两年前在巴黎跳蚤市场找到，当做纪念品寄给我的。褪色的明信片原本在1914年寄出——背面有仓促手写的深褐色潦草德文字迹，收件人是英国的医生，旁边有那位美国学生自己用黑色墨水写给我得问候语：有朝一日请想我。那张照片会让奥利弗想起我第一次大胆说出真心话的早上；或我们骑车经过崖径却假装没注意的那天；或我们决定在那里野餐，发誓不碰彼此，以便能更享受当日下午一起躺在床上的那天。我希望他永远把那张明信片放在他眼前，一辈子，放在他的书桌前，床前，每个地方。钉在你去的每个地方。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A while after supper, I saw my father sitting at his usual place at the breakfast table. His chair was turned out and facing the sea, and on his lap were the proofs of his latest book. He was drinking his usual chamomile tea, enjoying the night.

<div class="line_en">The mystery was resolved, as such things always are with me, in my sleep that night. It had never struck me until then. And yet it had been staring me in the face for two whole years. His name was Maynard. Early one afternoon, while he must have known everyone was resting, he had knocked at my window to see if I had black ink -- he had run out, he said, and only used black ink, as he knew I did. He stepped in. I was wearing only a bathing suit and went to my desk and handed him the bottle. He stared at me, stood there for an awkward moment, and then took the bottle. That same evening he left the flask right outside my balcony door. Any other person would have knocked again and handed it back to me. I was fifteen then. But I wouldn't have said no. In the course of one of our conversations I had told him about my favorite spot in the hills.</div>

I spoke about the perennially dirty, run-down conditions of Rome's piazzas. The heat, the weather, traffic, too many nuns. Such-and-such a church closed down. Debris everywhere. Seedy renovations.

In my place, most parents would hope the whole thing goes away, or pray that their sons land on their feet soon enough. But I am not such a parent. In your place, if there is pain, nurse it, and if there is a flame, don't snuff it out, don't be brutal with it. Withdrawal can be a terrible thing when it keeps us awake at night, and watching others forget us sooner than we'd want to be forgotten is no better. We rip out so much of ourselves to be cured of things faster than we should that we go bankrupt by the age of thirty and have less to offer each time we start with someone new.

I was starting to fear we'd slip back to our early days when, but for patio pleasantries, avoidance and indifference were the norm. Why had his phone calls not prepared me for this? Was I the one responsible for the new tenor of our friendship? Had my parents said something? Had he come back for me? Or for them, for the house, to get away? He had come back for his book, which had already been published in England, in France, in Germany, and was finally due to come out in Italy. It was an elegant volume, and we were all very happy for him, including the bookseller in B., who promised a book party the following summer. "Maybe. We'll see," said Oliver after we'd stopped there on our bikes. The ice cream vendor was closed for the season. As were the flower shop and the pharmacy where we'd stopped on leaving the berm that very first time when he showed me how badly he'd scraped himself. They all belonged to a lifetime ago. The town felt empty, the sky was gray. One night he had a long talk with my father. In all likelihood they were discussing me, or my plans for college, or last summer, or his new book. When they opened the door, I heard laughter in the hallway downstairs, my mother kissing him. A while later there was a knock at my bedroom door, not the French windows -- that entrance was to remain permanently shut, then. "Want to talk?" I was already in bed. He had a sweater on and seemed dressed to go out for a walk. He sat on the edge of my bed, looking as uneasy as I must have seemed the first time when this room used to be his. "I might be getting married this spring," he said. I was dumbfounded. "But you never said anything."</div>

People getting married was always wonderful news, I was happy for them, marriages were good, and the broad smile on my face was genuine enough, even if it occurred to me a while later that such news couldn't possibly bode well for us. Did I mind? he asked. "You're being silly," I said. Long silence. "Will you be getting in bed now?" I asked. He looked at me gingerly. "For a short while. But I don't want to do anything." It sounded like an updated and far more polished version of Later, maybe. So we were back to that, were we? I had an impulse to mimic him but held back. He lay beside me on top of the blanket with his sweater on. All he had taken off was his loafers. "How long do you think this will go on?" he asked wryly. "Not long, I hope." He kissed me on the mouth, but it wasn't the kiss after the Pasquino, when he'd pressed me hard against the wall on via Santa Maria dell'Anima. I recognized the taste instantly. I'd never realized how much I liked it or how long I'd missed it. One more item to log on that checklist of things I'd miss before losing him for good. I was about to get out from under the blankets. "I can't do this," he said, and sprang away. "I can," I replied. "Yes, but I can't." I must have had iced razor blades in my eyes, for he suddenly realized how angry I was. "I'd love nothing better than to take your clothes off and at the very least hold you. But I can't." I put my arms around his head and held it. "Then maybe you shouldn't stay.

The only letter I did send the year after was to tell him that Vimini had died. He wrote to all of us saying how sorry he was. He was traveling in Asia, so that by the time his letter reached us, his reaction to Vimini's death, rather than soothe an open sore, seemed to graze one that had healed on its own. Writing to him about her was like crossing the last footbridge between us, especially after it became clear we weren't ever going to mention what had once existed between us, or, for that matter, that we weren't even mentioning it. Writing had also been my way of telling him what college I was attending in the States, in case my father, who kept an active correspondence with all of our previous residents, hadn't already told him. Ironically, Oliver wrote back to my address in Italy -- another reason for the delay.</div>

<div class="line_en">One summer, nine years after his last letter, I received a phone call in the States from my parents. "You'll never guess who is staying with us for two days. In your old bedroom. And standing right in front of me now." I had already guessed, of course, but pretended I couldn't. "The fact that you refuse to say you've already guessed says a great deal," my father said with a snicker before saying goodbye. There was a tussle between my parents over who was to hand their phone over. Finally his voice came through. "Elio," he said. I could hear my parents and the voices of children in the background. No one could say my name that way. "Elio," I repeated, to say it was I speaking but also to spark our old game and show I'd forgotten nothing. "It's Oliver," he said. He had forgotten.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有一年夏天收到他最后一封信之后九年，我在美国接到父母来电。“你一定猜不到谁来我们家住两天。就住在你的旧卧房，而且现在就站在我面前。”我当然早就猜到，却假装猜不出来。“你拒绝说你已经猜到，其实已经透露许多事实。”道别前，父亲窃笑着说，接着父母争论谁该把电话交出来。总算传来他的声音。“艾里奥。”他说。我听见父母和背景中有小孩的声音。没有人会这样唤我的名字。“艾里奥。”我重复，意思是我在听，也为了启动我们过去的游戏，证明我什么都没忘。“我是奥利弗。”他说。他已经忘了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then came the blank years. If I were to punctuate my life with the people whose bed I shared, and if these could be divided in two categories -- those before and those after Oliver -- then the greatest gift life could bestow on me was to move this divider forward in time. Many helped me part life into Before X and After X segments, many brought joy and sorrow, many threw my life off course, while others made no difference whatsoever, so that Oliver, who for so long had loomed like a fulcrum on the scale of life, eventually acquired successors who either eclipsed him or reduced him to an early signpost, a minor fork in the road, a small, fiery Mercury on a voyage out to Pluto and beyond. Fancy this, I might say: at the time I knew Oliver, I still hadn't met so-and-so. Yet life without so-and-so was simply unthinkable.</div>

<div class="line_en">Four years later, while passing through his college town, I did the unusual. I decided to show up. I sat in his afternoon lecture hall and, after class, as he was putting away his books and packing loose sheets into a folder, I walked up to him. I wasn't going to make him guess who I was, but I wasn't going to make it easy either.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="四年后，经过他所在的大学城，我做了不寻常的事。我决定露面。我坐在他下午授课的讲堂里，下课后，趁他收拾书本，把散置的纸张收回档案夹时，我向他走去。我不会要他猜我是谁，却也不打算让他好过。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"They showed me pictures, you haven't changed," he said. He spoke about his two boys who were right now playing in the living room with my mother, eight and six, I should meet his wife, I am so happy to be here, you have no idea, no idea. It's the most beautiful spot in the world, I said, pretending to infer that he was happy because of the place. You can't understand how happy I am to be here. His words were breaking up, he passed the phone back to my mother, who, before turning to me, was still speaking to him with endearing words. "Ma s'è tutto commosso, he's all choked up," she finally said to me. "I wish I could be with you all," I responded, getting all worked up myself over someone I had almost entirely stopped thinking about. Time makes us sentimental. Perhaps, in the end, it is because of time that we suffer.</div>

"You probably don't remember me," I began, as he squinted somewhat, trying to place me. He was suddenly distant, as if stricken by the fear that we had met in a place he didn't care to remember. He put on a tentative, ironic, questioning look, an uncomfortable, puckered smile, as if rehearsing something like, I'm afraid you're mistaking me for somebody else. Then he paused. "Good God -- Elio!" It was my beard that had thrown him off, he said. He embraced me, and then patted my furry face several times as if I were younger than I'd even been that summer so long ago.

<div class="line_en">Or was it that I was jealous of his family, of the life he'd made for himself, of the things I never shared and couldn't possibly have known about? Things he had longed for, loved, and lost, and whose loss had crushed him, but whose presence in his life, when he had them, I wasn't there to witness and wouldn't know the first thing about. I wasn't there when he'd acquired them, wasn't there when he'd given them up. Or was it much, much simpler? I had come to see if I felt something, if something was still alive. The trouble was I didn't want anything to be alive either.</div>

<div class="line_en">The very possibility of meeting his family suddenly alarmed me -- too real, too sudden, too in-my-face, not rehearsed enough. Over the years I'd lodged him in the permanent past, my pluperfect lover, put him on ice, stuffed him with memories and mothballs like a hunted ornament confabulating with the ghost of all my evenings. I'd dust him off from time to time and then put him back on the mantelpiece. He no longer belonged to earth or to life. All I was likely to discover at this point wasn't just how distant were the paths we'd taken, it was the measure of loss that was going to strike me -- a loss I didn't mind thinking about in abstract terms but which would hurt when stared at in the face, the way nostalgia hurts long after we've stopped thinking of things we've lost and may never have cared for.</div>

<div class="line_en">All these years, whenever I thought of him, I'd think either of B. or of our last days in Rome, the whole thing leading up to two scenes: the balcony with its attendant agonies and via Santa Maria dell'Anima, where he'd pushed me against the old wall and kissed me and in the end let me put one leg around his. Every time I go back to Rome, I go back to that one spot. It is still alive for me, still resounds with something totally present, as though a heart stolen from a tale by Poe still throbbed under the ancient slate pavement to remind me that, here, I had finally encountered the life that was right for me but had failed to have. I could never think of him in New England. When I lived in New England for a while and was separated from him by no more than fifty miles, I continued to imagine him as stuck in Italy somewhere, unreal and spectral. The places where he'd lived also felt inanimate, and as soon as I tried thinking of them, they too would float and drift away, no less unreal and spectral. Now, it turned out, not only were New England towns very much alive, but so was he. I could easily have thrust myself on him years ago, married or unmarried -- unless it was I who, despite all appearances, had all along been unreal and spectral myself.</div>

He was amazingly handsome still, no loss of hair, no fat, still jogged every morning, he said, skin still as smooth as then. Only a few sunspots on his hands.

They broke my heart, and I wanted to kiss each and every one away. "Too much sun in my salad days. Besides, it shouldn't be so surprising. I'm getting on.

I imagined being in his car asking myself, Who knows, would I want to, would he want to, perhaps a nightcap at the bar would decide, knowing that, all through dinner that evening, he and I would be worrying about the same exact thing, hoping it might happen, praying it might not, perhaps a nightcap would decide -- I could just read it on his face as I pictured him looking away while uncorking a bottle of wine or while changing the music, because he too would catch the thought racing through my mind and want me to know he was debating the exact same thing, because, as he'd pour the wine for his wife, for me, for himself, it would finally dawn on us both that he was more me than I had ever been myself, because when he became me and I became him in bed so many years ago, he was and would forever remain, long after every forked road in life had done its work, my brother, my friend, my father, my son, my husband, my lover, myself. In the weeks we'd been thrown together that summer, our lives had scarcely touched, but we had crossed to the other bank, where time stops and heaven reaches down to earth and gives us that ration of what is from birth divinely ours. We looked the other way. We spoke about everything but. But we've always known, and not saying anything now confirmed it all the more. We had found the stars, you and I. And this is given once only.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着我想起深夜开车回程途中，沿着星光照耀的河流，来到这间位于海岸线上摇摇欲坠的古旧新英格兰旅馆。我希望这条海岸线让我们俩都想起B城的海湾，想起凡·高的星夜，想起我到岩石上与他作伴、吻他脖子的那一夜。还有最后一晚，我们一起走在岸边，感觉我们已经用尽在最后关头延迟他离开的魔法。我想象我在他的车里问自己，天晓得，我是否想要、他是否想要；或许在酒吧里喝一杯睡前酒就能决定。明明知道那一晚整顿晚餐吃下来，他和我担心的恰是同一件事：希望事情发生，祈祷事情不发生。或许一杯睡前酒就能决定。我想象他拔去酒瓶瓶塞或换音乐时撇开眼的样子，光凭他的表情我就揣摩得出来，因为他同样也了解飞掠过我心头的想法，并且希望我知道他也为同一件事挣扎。当他为他的妻子、为我、为他自己倒酒，我们俩终究会明白，他比任何时候的我都更像我自己，因为多年前在床上，他成为我、我成为他之后，在每条人生的岔路完成任务许久之后，他是、也将永远是我的兄弟、我的朋友、我的父亲、我的儿子、我的丈夫、我的恋人和我自己。在那年夏天巧遇的几周，我们的人生几乎未受影响，却跨越到时间静止、天堂降临人间的彼岸，得到从降生以来神注定要赐给我们的那一份。我们别开眼。除了这件事，我们无所不谈。但我们始终知道，现在什么都不说更确认了这一点。我们已经找到星星，你和我。而这是绝无仅有的一次恩赐。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I tried to picture his happy family, boys immersed in homework, or lumbering back from late practice, surly, ill-tempered thumping with muddied boots, every cliché racing through my mind. This is the man whose house I stayed in when I lived in Italy, he'd say, followed by grumpy harrumphs from two adolescents who couldn't be bothered by the man from Italy or the house in Italy, but who'd reel in shock if told, Oh, and by the way, this man who was almost your age back then and who spent most of his days quietly transcribing The Seven Last Words of Christ each morning would sneak into my room at night and we'd fuck our brains out.

<div class="line_en">I wasn't eager to go upstairs with him and was relieved to see Manfredi and Mafalda shuffle out of the kitchen to greet him as soon as they'd heard his taxi. Their giddy hugs and kisses defused some of the uneasiness I knew I'd feel as soon as he'd settled down in our house. I wanted their overexcited welcome to last well into the first hour of his stay. Anything to prevent us from sitting face-to-face over coffee and finally speaking the unavoidable two words: twenty years.</div>

<div class="line_en">Last summer he finally did come back. It was for an overnight visit, on his way from Rome to Menton. He arrived by cab down the tree-lined driveway, where the car stopped more or less where it had stopped twenty years before. He sprang out with his laptop, a huge athletic duffel bag, and a large gift-wrapped box, obviously a present. "For your mother," he said when he caught my glance. "Better tell her what's in it," I said as soon as I helped put his things down in the foyer. "She suspects everyone." He understood. It saddened him.</div>

<div class="line_en">Instead, we'd leave his things in the foyer and hope Manfredi would bring them upstairs while Oliver and I took a quick walk around the house. "I'm sure you're dying to see," I'd say, meaning the garden, the balustrade, and the view of the sea. We'd work our way behind the pool, back into the living room where the old piano stood next to the French windows, and finally we would return to the foyer and find that his things had indeed already been carried upstairs. Part of me might want him to realize that nothing had changed since he'd been here last, that the orle of paradise was still there, and that the tilting gate to the beach still squeaked, that the world was exactly as he'd left it, minus Vimini, Anchise, and my father. This was the welcoming gesture I meant to extend. But another part of me wanted him to sense there was no point trying to catch up now -- we'd traveled and been through too much without each other for there to be any common ground between us. Perhaps I wanted him to feel the sting of loss, and grieve. But in the end, and by way of compromise, perhaps, I decided that the easiest way was to show I'd forgotten none of it. I made a motion to take him to the empty lot that remained as scorched and fallow as when I'd shown it to him two decades before. I had barely finished my offer --"Been there, done that," he replied. It was his way of telling me he hadn't forgotten either. "Maybe you'd prefer to make a quick stop at the bank." He burst out laughing. "I'll bet you they never closed my account."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们把他的东西留在门厅，希望曼弗雷迪趁奥利弗和我很快绕屋子一圈时，把东西搬上楼。“我相信你一定急着想看吧。”我会这么说，指的是花园、栏杆、海景。好不容易走到游泳池后面，回到落地窗边放着旧钢琴的客厅，最后回到门厅，发现他的东西真的拿上楼了。我可能希望他明白，自从他上次来过之后，一切都没有改变，天堂的门阶依然在那儿，通往海边那扇歪斜的门依旧吱嘎作响，世界仍和他离开时一模一样，只是少了薇米妮、安喀斯和父亲。这是我想摆出来的欢迎姿势。但我也希望他了解现在没必要叙旧。我们在少了彼此陪伴的状况下走过、也经历太多，彼此没有任何共有的基础。或许我希望他感觉到失去和悲伤的刺痛。但到头来，或许经由妥协，我断定最简单的办法是表示我什么都没忘。我提议带他去那块仍然和二十年前带他去时一样酷热、一样正在休耕的空地。我还没说完，他抢白道：“去过了，已完成。”那是他告诉我他也没忘的方式。“或许你宁可赶快去一趟银行。”他爆笑出来。“我敢跟你打赌，他们一直没关掉我的户头。”">查看中文翻译</div>

When there's a breeze and they swell and I look up from down here or stand outside on the balcony, I'll catch myself thinking that you're in there, staring out from your world to my world, saying, as you did on that one night when I found you on the rock, I've been happy here. You're thousands of miles away but no sooner do I look at this window than I'll think of a bathing suit, a shirt thrown on on the fly, arms resting on the banister, and you're suddenly there, lighting up your first cigarette of the day -- twenty years ago today.
