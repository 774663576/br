<div class="line_en">Leaving Dowayoland is as protracted an undertaking as getting there. This time, fortunately, I was a mere tourist, not a searcher after knowledge -- as far as my papers were concerned. Nevertheless, a protracted bout of leave-taking was called for, a judicious distribution of largesse, an expressing of thanks. Habits of the bush had to be shed. Habits of the city resumed. As the only English-speaker for miles, I had quite naturally dropped into the habit of talking to myself. Talking to oneself or 'thinking out loud', as I determinedly called it, carries for Dowayos none of the connotations of wild-eyed lunacy that it has in our own culture. It is as normal as singing to oneself, which is something Dowayos do all the time. It is a hard habit to drop. Especially in one who had had to cut his own hair without a mirror and has green, fetid teeth it can be initially disconcerting.</div>

<div class="line_en">The circumcision-of-the-bow ceremony is just one of the complex rites by which a man moves from being a dead individual to being an ancestor available for reincarnation. His most intimate and therefore his most dangerous personal possessions must be disposed of. Knife, sleeping-mat and penis-sheath must be buried in the bush. His bow must be circumcised by a clown and hung behind the house where the skulls of dead men are kept. Only a man's 'brothers of circumcision', those who were cut with him, can be associated with this operation. The whole affair is conducted with the jokey good humour that characterizes all-male events. Women must shut themselves up in their huts when the special flutes for the ceremony are heard.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“死者之弓割礼”乃连串复杂的仪式之一，让男性亡灵变成可以转世投胎的祖先。举行这种仪式，属于死者最私人（也是最危险）的用器必须处理掉。刀子、睡觉的席子、阴茎鞘要拿到丛林里烧掉。他的弓必须由小丑执行割礼，然后挂到搁置男性祖先头颅的屋子后面。只有死者的“割礼兄弟”（和他同时接受割礼的人）可以参与此项仪式。“死者之弓割礼”和所有纯男性参加的活动一样，充斥几近玩笑的快活气氛。女人听到特属仪式使用的笛子声，就得躲进茅屋里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Anthropology is a subject that many people move on to from other disciplines. It sets its bounds extremely wide. This is why nothing one has learnt is ever wasted for an anthropologist, be it never so impractical a skill or never so recondite an ability. As a child, on my first day at school, I was made to listen with my classmates to one of the BBC programmes for children. At that time, it was held to be important and healthy for children to dance. Young minds were to be encouraged to express themselves in motion. Mind and body would move in perfect harmony to the rhythm of pure melodies. Our task on that particular day was to be trees. 'Wave your branches, children,' we were instructed in fluting tones. 'Show how the wind rustles your leaves.' Dutifully, we waved our arms over our heads and made whooshing noises.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sometimes there is no suitable Fulani-thorn tree available and the tree must be played by a human actor. This part was assigned to me; little did the Dowayos realize that I had deep wells of previous experience as a tree on which I could draw. The waving of the arms went down very well. Views on my version of rustling were more divided. However, in the quite general good humour of the rite it was accepted as a fine innovation. Since the tree-actor is permitted only a penis-sheath as garb and has to wear certain branches of the unpleasantly thorny Fulani tree as a concession to naturalism, it is perhaps not a popular role.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有时，他们找不到“富来尼之刺”，便由男子假扮树。此次，个角色落在我头上。多瓦悠人不知我扮演树的经验可是取之不竭呢。挥舞双臂假装树枝，颇获赞赏。风吹树叶的沙沙声则引来两极意见。无论如何，众人秉持仪式的快活气氛，将我的演出视之不错的创新。由于演树的演员也只能穿阴茎鞘，身上还要覆盖颇不舒服的“富来尼之刺”树叶模仿自然产品，总之，不是大家抢着演的角色。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The ritual involves the men running around naked except for penis sheaths and ends in a little play that all men can witness. It deals with the origin of circumcision in the beating to death of an old Fulani woman. She is played by one of the men, old, decrepit, excessively cantankerous and timorous. He dresses up in the bulky leaves favoured by old ladies and makes great play with bending down in such a way as to expose his genitals. This is hugely enjoyed by all men present and evokes great hoots of laughter. The highpoint involves the ambush of the woman by men who crouch down with sticks. She waddles tremulously between them several times, dragging a long tail of leaves behind her. Finally, they leap up and chop off the tail with their sticks. All this has to happen under a special tree called 'Fulani thorn'.</div>

<div class="line_en">All the men sat around afterwards smoking and drinking warm beer. There was some discussion as to who should spit on the widows of the dead man, so releasing them for remarriage. Matthieu and I were busy packing up. A sorcerer dropped round with a handful of aromatic leaves. I had been in contact with death, I must not forget to wash my hands with these leaves. Also I should join in the spitting on the widows, to show that I had no grudge against the man whose ceremonies we had performed. It all seemed terribly normal. Afterwards, we took off our penis-sheaths like undergraduates taking off their gowns, relaxing after the weekly tutorial. Tonight, there would be drinking, and dancing stories would be told. Matthieu and I headed for the mission as a halfway house on the road back to a separate normality. No one seemed particularly interested in our departure. There were no tears or elaborate farewells. Zuuldibo sought to raise the unresolved problem of his umbrella, some money was left to pay for the new roof of my hut. When would I return? Only God knew.</div>

<div class="line_en">As in various other institutions of learning, many of the pupils had assumed false identities. Rules concerning the number of times a single pupil may take the same examination are sidestepped by borrowing the identity of a younger brother or sister. Some of the putative sixteen-year olds in the class had grey hair. A disconcerting number had the same names. The problem was exacerbated by twins. Having sought the term for 'twins' in a French-English dictionary they had discovered that they were 'binoculars' and referred to themselves by this term. 'This is my sister, Naomi, patron.

<div class="line_en">The aggressive maître d'hôtel had flourished and prospered in the meanwhile. His smooth, fat face shone with self-satisfaction. With cowed relief, I noted that he did not recognize me as Humphrey's ally. He now seemed completely to dominate the hotel with his autocratic rule. The manager, a furtive Frenchman, huddled in his office as the maître d'hôtel stalked the lobby. By slow degrees, he had insinuated relatives into strategic positions on the staff. None of them spoke any language of wide circulation with the result that guests were unable to make themselves understood. Only the maître d'hôtel could give them orders. This arrangement extended to the waiters in the bar. American tourists would give long complicated orders involving recondite cocktails compounded of rare liqueurs. The waiters would bow gracefully and smile, returning after considerable delay with random assortments of orange squash and beer, which would be set down, regardless of complaint, on the table. By some rule of the house, there was always one drink for each customer. The new arrangement had not passed unnoticed. A group of bored and jaded Frenchmen had seized on it as a source of diversion and were laying bets on the relative number of orange squashes and beers in the next order.</div>

'So there was this knocking on the door at one in the morning. Gave me a start. Then this voice shouted, "Hey, have you got a woman in there?" I shouted back that I hadn't. There was this crash.

<div class="line_en">The journey to the airport the next day took hours. The President was making some sort of a public visit to the town which meant that whole areas had been sealed off. Many roads were closed. I huddled uncomfortably in the back of the taxi, carrying a large Dowayo water-pot on my knees like a yokel, waiting for the inevitable attempt to introduce further passengers. The driver took exotic detours to avoid barriers. Some seemed to involve driving through people's gardens. We came to a halt at an intersection. A policeman stopped us sternly. 'Stop. Here comes Monsieur le Président.' An expectant hush settled over the crowd. Soldiers and police unbuttoned their holsters. I leaned out of the window. For a second, there was no movement. Then, with infinite slowness, a baffled old man rounded the corner on a rusty bicycle. Intimidated by the attention of so many people, by so many gaping mouths, he bent low over the handlebars and pedalled furiously. Several large policemen leapt on him and dragged him away to the cheers of the crowd. The sergeant in front noticed my grin. 'Stop laughing!' he screamed. 'You are mocking the President.' The driver gave a nervous glance at me and shot off at speed. It appeared that this was a reflex he had developed in the course of many years' dealings with the law. He unloaded me without further incident at the airport, cheerfully pocketing my grateful tip. Furtively clutching my pot, I lurked in a dark corner until the reservations desk opened, hoping that I looked inconspicuous. This, however, was Duala. I stood about as much chance as a non-swimmer in a pool of sharks. A small sharp-looking man homed in on me, looking me over appraisingly, watchful eyes noting -- no doubt -- the sweat on the forehead, the tight clasping of the pot. 'Paris flight?' he asked. I nodded. He executed one of those sharp intakes of breath beloved of garage mechanics as they survey the damage. It appeared that the flight was very heavily booked. Indeed all the seats had been sold several times. Fortunately, however, he had a friend who worked at the desk. For ten thousand francs he could get me a seat on that plane… Outraged, I sent him packing. Did he not know I had been here before? I was wise to such tricks. He shrugged and moved away. Later I saw a worried German passing him notes.</div>

<div class="line_en">The plane was, quite simply, empty. The others at the desk were embarked on a charter flight. The six or seven of us who shared the plane until its first stop were almost lost inside. There was even a spare seat for the pot that haunted me, albatross-like. It came as some comfort to learn that I was not the only one who had been bilked, two of my fellow passengers admitting to at least the same amount of credulity as myself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="结果，飞机根本空荡荡。柜台前大排长龙的人是要搭包机。下站之前，整班飞机只有六到七个乘客。甚至还有多余座位放置我路忧心不已的水瓮。差堪安慰的是我并非唯一受骗者，两位同机乘客坦承和我一样轻信那男子，付了相同金额。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As more and more people arrived, as more and more furtively passed over money, confidence began to wane. I totted up how much it would cost to spend another night in Duala. Perhaps at this very moment I was being sought by the entire Duala police force for mocking the President. I would be easy to find. A white man with green teeth and a pot. Perhaps I should abandon the pot and keep my mouth closed. Paranoia set in. After another half-hour. I was ready to do a deal. I sought out the tout. We haggled bitterly. I declared that I only had two thousand francs. I offered him the pot. Finally we agreed and he sidled over to the man at the desk. There was a deal of whispering and shaking of heads. Hands passed briefly under the counter. My ticket was stamped. I was on! I looked at all the others queuing before the desk, innocently unaware that they would never see the inside of the plane. I felt sorry for them, as I lugged my pot past the immigration desk.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="越来越多人现身机场，越来越多人形迹鬼祟交钱。我的信心开始消失。我默默核箅如果被迫在杜阿拉多待一晚要花多少旅馆钱。或许此刻杜阿拉所有警察都在找我，因为我嘲笑他们的总统。他们要找到我，一点不难。一个满口绿牙的白人手里抱着水瓮。或许我该丢掉水瓮，闭上我的嘴。惊慌偏执情绪逐渐上升。半小时后，我决定与那男子打交道。我找到这名消息灵通者，激烈讨价还价。我坚称身上只剩两千法朗，或许他愿意收下水瓮？最后他终于同意只收两千法朗，悄悄走到柜台一男子身旁。他们低语交谈、不时摇头。钞票在柜台下迅速换手。我的机票盖了章。我搭上这班飞机了！我看看那些在柜台前排队、天真无知、浑然不觉他们永远搭不上这班飞机的人，真是替他们感到可怜。我拖着水瓮前往出境柜台。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The air-conditioned tedium of the flight seemed like a good time to draft a report to the Research Council. I dug down in my bag for the appropriate form and found it nestling under the health-insurance policy that forbade me to go hang-gliding or to use power-assisted woodworking tools while among the Dowayos.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无聊又有冷气的飞行似乎是撰写报告给奖助委员会的好时机。我伸手到袋子里翻找表格，发现它埋在一大叠保险单下面，保单上的禁止项目包括我在多瓦悠兰期间不准玩滑翔翼，也不准使用插电的木工器具。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The only comfort was to be derived from one even more gullible. He had purchased what was clearly a Precocious-type pendant in a bar, being assured that it was 'eight thousand years old'. The canny salesman had warned the traveller that this piece was so rare, so valuable, of such cultural importance to the Cameroonian nation, that it could not be legally exported. However, fortunately, this man had a friend in the customs service at the airport. For a further sum, it could be arranged that the man would be able to get it on the plane…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="唯一安慰来自另一个更轻易受骗的乘客。他在酒吧里买了一个显然是“早熟”风格的挂饰，对方向他保证此物的历史至少八千年。谨慎的推销员还一再叮咛他此物极为罕见、万分珍贵、对喀国深具文化重要性，无法合法带出境。幸好，他认识一个在海关工作的人只要再付一点钱，那人就可以安排让此物上飞机……">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Writing a report is a dangerous thing. Once written it becomes the fieldwork and takes on a life of its own. It becomes impossible to think of what one has done in any other way. The experience is packaged and sealed. Possibly, I should simply not mention the non-occurrence of circumcision. It was hard to believe that anyone would notice. I could simply dwell on things I had done. A neat summation of the work with Dowayo healers would imply that this is what I had deliberately set out to do. Research bodies normally assume that the world moves in straight lines according to the programme laid down by the researcher. The ethnographer is omniscient and smoothly competent, a well-oiled investigative machine. All anthropologists, however, know that research proposals are works of fiction. They almost all boil down to one simple request. 'I think such and such might be interesting. Can I have some money to go and look?'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="写报告是件危险的事。一旦白纸黑字，它就变成田野采集成果，自有其生命。你无法想象事实可能并非如此。或许，我应该只字不提割礼并未举行（反正也不会有人注意），聚焦于我做了些什么。我该写个漂亮大纲论述我与多瓦悠疗者的研究，让人觉得这本来就是我前往多瓦悠兰的目的。奖助委员会的人常认为世界是循研究者设定的直线乖乖运作。民族志学者是全知博学、应付裕如、效率卓著的调查机器。人类学家却都知道研究计划根本是虚构小说，追根究底，不过是开口要求：“我认为这个很有趣。能否赏些钱让我去看看？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A trip terminated always brings a sense of sadness at the passing of time, the rupturing of relationships. Combined with this is a very basic sense of relief at returning, relatively unscathed, to a world that is secure and predictable, where plagues of black, hairy caterpillars do not overturn the cosmic timetable. It leads too to fresh ways of seeing ourselves -- which is perhaps why anthropology is ultimately a selfish discipline.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="结束旅行总会带来哀伤与时光飞逝感。你因自己毫发无伤重返一个安全、可预期、黑色毛毛虫瘟疫不会推翻宇宙时间表的世界而如释重负。诸此种种，都让你以全新眼光审视自己，或许如此，人类学到头来终究是个自私的学科。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As a contrast to the steamy delights of Duala, I took a seat in an extremely chic pavement café by the Paris Opéra, passing the time by watching the passers-by. An extremely ragged tramp appeared and sized up the clientele, much as the airport tout had appraised travellers. Indeed, the resemblance was made closer by the fact that this man was also black. He turned to the seated crowd and tapped his nose in the conventional French gesture of conspiratorial knowledge and drew from inside his coat a large, plastic rat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大异于在杜阿拉饱尝劫掠诈欺，此刻，我坐在巴黎歌剧院旁时髦的人行道咖啡座，观赏行人打发时间。一名衣着极端槛褛的流浪汉现身，仿佛杜阿拉机场那个消息灵通者，目光灼灼打量咖啡座顾客。因为他也是黑人，与杜阿拉机场那人更像了。面朝客人，他以常见的法国手势点点鼻子，以示他与众人共谋，然后从外套口袋掏出一只塑胶大老鼠。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The fact that so many return to rather uncomfortable and sometimes dangerous parts of the world is eloquent testimony to both the shortness of the human memory and the weakness of common sense in the face of sheer curiosity.</div>

<div class="line_en">After a dozen or so assaults, he passed round the tables with his hat and collected a fair sum of money. The label showed it to have been made in Cameroon. To a Dowayo all this would be a powerful omen of something. It served at least as a recall to duty. I drew out the report form I had to send to the Research Council and, taking a deep breath, began, 'Owing to an extraordinary plague of black, hairy caterpillars…'</div>
