<div class="line_en">It was a time of change in the country. People moved and found new jobs and bought televisions, and the newspapers started talking about a "middle class." Ove didn't quite know what this was, but he was well aware that he was not a part of it. The middle classes moved into new housing developments with straight walls and carefully trimmed lawns, and it soon grew clear to Ove that his parental home stood in the way of progress. And if there was anything this middle class was not enamored of, it was whatever stood in the way of progress.</div>

<div class="line_en">A week after his eighteenth birthday, Ove passed his driving test, responded to an advertisement, and walked fifteen miles to buy his first own car: a blue Saab 93. He sold his dad's old Saab 92 to pay for it. It was only marginally newer, admittedly, and quite a run-down Saab 93 at that, but a man was not a proper man until he had bought his own car, felt Ove. And so it was.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="成年一周之后，欧维过了驾考，按照报纸上的一则广告打了电话，走了两英里半的路买来他自己的第一辆萨博。蓝色的。他卖了父亲的那辆老92，买了一辆款式稍新一点的。其实，这辆93比那辆老车新不了几成，看上去已经挺旧，但没买过车的男人不算真正的男人，欧维想。于是就有了车。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ove received several letters from the council about what was called "the redrawing of municipal boundaries." He didn't quite understand the content of these letters, but he understood that his parental home did not fit among the new-built houses on the street. The council notified him of their intention to force him to sell the land to them so the house could be demolished and another built in its place.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维从市政府那儿收到许多信，关于什么“重绘市政边界”。他不太理解信的内容，但他知道大致是说他父母的房子跟这条街上的其他新房不太搭。市政府明示要他把地卖给他们的意图，这样就能把房子拆掉建别的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Whatever the case, he parked his first very own car in the garden that evening and sat in the driver's seat for several hours, gazing at the house. It was, to be blunt, decrepit. His father's specialty had been machines, not building, and Ove was not much better himself. These days he used only the kitchen and the little room leading off it, while the entire second floor was slowly being turned into a recreational stamping ground for mice. He watched the house from the car, as if hoping that it might start repairing itself if he waited patiently enough. It lay exactly on the boundary between two municipal authorities, on a line on the map that would now be moved one way or the other. It was the remnant of an extinguished little village at the edge of the forest, next to the shining residential development into which people wearing suits had now moved with their families.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但不论是哪种情况，当晚他把他拥有的第一辆车停在院子里，坐在前座上瞪着房子看了几个小时。它的确已经破败不堪。父亲对机械确实很有研究，但造房子就不怎么拿手了。欧维自己也没好到哪儿去，如今他只使用厨房和它跟前的一小间房，整个一层渐渐变成了老鼠的游乐园。他从车里注视着房子，就好像只要他有足够的耐心，就能等到房子自动修复。它正好落在两市的交界处，落在地图上即将朝某个方向移动的那条线上。这是树林边界处一座已经灭绝的小镇所残存的最后一栋房子，紧挨着那些西装笔挺、领带飘飘的人举家迁入的闪亮别墅区。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ove wasn't sure what it was that made him refuse. Maybe because he didn't like the tone of that letter from the council. Or because the house was all he had left of his family.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维也不是很清楚自己为什么要拒绝。或许是因为他不喜欢市政府那封信里的口气，又或许是因为这房子是他家仅剩的财产。">查看中文翻译</div>

</div>
<div class="line_en">And so, filled with a kind of strange defiance that made Ove's heart beat a little faster for the first time in years, he decided not to sell his house to the council. He decided to do the opposite. Repair it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="出于某种莫名的叛逆，欧维的心跳在平静了多年之后又因此加速起来，他决定不把房子卖给市政府。要反其道而为之。他要翻新它。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Of course, he had no idea of how to do it. He didn't know a dovetail joint from a pot of potatoes. Realizing that his new working hours left him entirely free in the daytime, he went to a nearby construction site and applied for a job. He imagined this must be the best possible place to learn about building and he didn't need much sleep anyway. The only thing they could offer him was a laboring job, said the foreman. Ove took it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="直到那时候，他还完全不明白应该做点什么。他都搞不清水平仪和一锅土豆的区别。想到这份新工作把他的整个白天都腾了出来，他就跑到附近的工地上找工作。他觉得那肯定是最适合学习造房子的地方，况且他睡得也不多。他们还缺个跑腿的，工头说，于是欧维就把这个职位接了下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The suits didn't like the lonely youth in the house due for demolition at the end of the street. The children were not allowed to play around Ove's house. Suits preferred to live in the vicinity of other suits, Ove had come to understand. He had nothing against that, of course -- but they were the ones who had moved into his neighborhood, not the other way around.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那些领带男一点都不喜欢街尽头这座即将拆除的牢房里住着的孤独少年。他们不让孩子在欧维家附近玩耍。领带们宁可住在别的领带隔壁，欧维知道。对此，原则上他也没有任何意见，但现在实际上是他们搬到了欧维的街上，而不是相反。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So he spent his nights picking up litter on the line heading south out of town; then, after three hours of sleep, he used what time remained to dart up and down the scaffolding, listening to the men in hard hats talking about construction techniques. One day a week he was free, and then he dragged sacks of cement and wooden beams back and forth for eighteen hours at a stretch, perspiring and lonely, demolishing and rebuilding the only thing his parents had left him apart from the Saab and his father's wristwatch. Ove's muscles grew and he was a fast learner.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="晚上他在出城南下的火车上捡垃圾，然后睡上三个小时，剩余的时间，他都在脚手架上爬上爬下偷听头顶硬塑料安全帽的老家伙们聊建造技术。每周有一天休息，他就拖着水泥袋和木梁在冒着汗的孤独中来来回回整八个小时，去清理装修这份除了萨博和那块腕表外父母仅剩的遗产。欧维长出了肌肉。他学得也很快。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">One afternoon, as he was about to head home at the end of his shift, Ove found a little toolbox full of used tools by his clothes. It came with a note that simply read: "To the puppy."</div>

<div class="line_en">Once the rumors of his house-building had spread among his older colleagues, one or other of them occasionally asked Ove about it. When he damaged the wall in the living room, a wiry colleague with wonky front teeth, after spending twenty minutes telling Ove what an idiot he was for not knowing better from the start, taught him how to calculate the load-bearing parameters. When he laid the floor in the kitchen, a more heavy-built colleague with a missing little finger on one hand, after calling him a bonehead three dozen times, showed him how to take proper measurements.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ove had religiously fed the birds every other day since his father died. He only forgot to do it one morning. When the following morning he came out to compensate for his omission, he almost collided headfirst into the older man by the fence under the bird-table. His neighbor gave him an insulted glance; he had birdseed in his hands. They did not say anything to one another. Ove merely nodded and the older man gave him a little nod back. Ove went back into his house and from that time on made sure he kept to his own days.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="父亲死后，欧维坚持每两天喂一次鸟。有一天早晨他忘了，第二天他想去弥补的时候，在鸟窝的栅栏旁差点和老人撞个满怀。老人没好气地看看欧维。他手里拿着鸟食。两人彼此都没有说话。欧维只是简单地点点头，老人也简单地点头回应。欧维转身回家并从此一直遵守自己喂鸟的时间。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He kept out of the way of his neighbors as much as he could. He knew they didn't like him and he saw no reason to give them further ammunition. The only exception was an elderly man and his wife who lived next door to Ove. This man was the only one on their whole street who did not wear a tie.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他尽可能地躲开那些邻居。他知道他们不喜欢他，没有理由让他们加深这种厌恶感。但有一个例外，就是紧挨着欧维家和太太住在一起的一个老人。老人是整条街上唯一不打领带的男人——虽然欧维深信他往日年轻时是打领带的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Slowly, the house took shape. Screw by screw and floorboard by floorboard. No one saw it, of course, but there was no need for anyone to see it. A job well done is a reward in its own right, as his father always used to say.</div>

<div class="line_en">They never spoke to one another. But one morning when the older man stepped onto his front step, Ove was painting his fence. And when he was done with that, he also painted the other side of the fence. The older man didn't say anything about it, but when Ove went past his kitchen window in the evening they nodded at one another. And the next day there was a home-baked apple pie on Ove's front step. Ove had not eaten homemade apple pie since his mother died.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们从来都不交谈。但某个早晨，当老人走出家门站在台阶上的时候，他看见欧维正在粉刷自己那边的栅栏。刷完自己这边之后，他把另一边也刷了。当时老人什么都没说，但当晚欧维经过他家厨房窗口时，他们互相点头致意。第二天，欧维的台阶上出现了一盘家里烘焙的苹果派。妈妈走后，欧维就再也没有吃过自做的苹果派。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ove received more letters from the council. They became increasingly threatening in their tone and displeased that he still hadn't contacted them about the sale of his property.

<div class="line_en">He'd discovered that he liked houses. Maybe mostly because they were understandable. They could be calculated and drawn on paper. They did not leak if they were made watertight; they did not collapse if they were properly supported. Houses were fair, they gave you what you deserved. Which, unfortunately, was more than one could say about people.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他发现自己很喜欢房子。可能主要是因为房子是可以理喻的，可以计算并在纸上画出来。不好好做防水就会漏，不好好做结构就会塌。房子是公平的，你付出多少，它就给你多少。很不幸的是，这些话很难用在人类身上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And so the days went by. Ove went to work and came home and had sausages and spuds. He never felt alone despite his lack of company. Then one Sunday, as Ove was moving some planks, a jovial man with a round face and an ill-fitting suit turned up at his gate. The sweat ran from his forehead and he asked Ove if there might be a glass of water of the cold variety going spare. Ove saw no reason to deny him this, and while the man drank it by his gate, some small talk passed between them. Or rather, it was mostly the man with the round face who did the talking. It turned out that he was very interested in houses. Apparently he was in the midst of doing up his own house in another part of town. And somehow the man with the round face managed to invite himself into Ove's kitchen for a cup of coffee. Obviously, Ove was not used to this kind of pushy behavior, but after an hour-long conversation about house-building, he was prepared to admit to himself that it wasn't so unpleasant having a bit of company in the kitchen for a change.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="日复一日，欧维出门上班，然后下班回家吃香肠土豆。他从不寂寞，但也从来没人陪伴。后来，一个周日，欧维像往常一样把一堆木料搬来挪去的时候，突然，一个身穿一件略不合身的蓝色西服、快乐的圆脸男人，出现在他家门口。汗珠从他的额头直往下淌，他问欧维能不能借一碗水喝，最好是凉的。欧维找不到拒绝的理由，男人喝水的当口，两个人就在他家门口有一搭没一搭地聊了一会儿。或者说，主要是这个圆脸男人在说话。碰巧这个男人对房子也很有兴趣。他显然也在城市的另一个角落紧锣密鼓地翻修着他的房子。就这么三言两语之后，圆脸男人竟在欧维的厨房里讨到了一杯咖啡。欧维显然不习惯这样厚颜无耻的举动，但在几个小时关于房屋建造的谈话之后，他终于不得不承认，偶尔在厨房里有个聊伴还真可能并不那么让人讨厌。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The jovial man with the round face was filled with consternation, and he explained to Ove that it would be a veritable catastrophe for him if something happened to the house. After listening carefully to his many admonishments, Ove felt bound to agree with him. He had never given much thought to it until then. Which made him feel rather stupid now.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="快乐的圆脸男人开始担心起来，他对欧维解释，如果他的小破屋出了什么问题，对他来说，那真会是场名副其实的灾难。一通劝告之后，欧维觉得自己不得不表示同意。他从来没有如此想过，这其实让他有些惭愧。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ove continued avoiding his neighbors. He didn't want any problems with them. But unfortunately the problems seemed to have decided to seek out Ove instead. A few weeks after his house repairs were finished, one of his suited neighbors was burgled. It was the second burglary in the area in a relatively short period. The suits got together early next morning to deliberate on that young rascal in the condemned house, who must have had something to do with it. They knew very well "where he'd got the money for all that renovation." In the evening someone stuck a note under Ove's door, on which was written: "Clear off if you know what's good for you!" The night after that a stone was thrown through his window. Ove picked up the stone and changed the glass in the window. He never confronted the suits. Saw no purpose in it.

<div class="line_en">The suits stood in the street, staring like deer into headlights. The elderly man emerged out of the smoke, his wife leaning on his arm. She was coughing terribly. When the elderly man handed her over to one of the suits' wives, and then turned back towards the fire, several of the suits cried out to him, telling him to leave it. "It's too late! Wait for the fire brigade!" they roared. The elderly man didn't listen. Burning material fell over the threshold as he tried to step inside into a sea of fire.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="聚在大街上的领带们圆睁着眼睛，就像一群狍子瞪着一盏聚光灯。老人从浓烟中撤出来，怀里偎依着他的太太。她咳嗽得很厉害。老人把她交给其中一个领带男的太太之后，转身再次奔向火场，几个领带男同时冲他喊，让他别去：“太迟了！等消防员吧！”老人不听。当他刚要一头冲进火海时，燃烧着的碎片轰然落到门槛上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ove stood in the face of the wind by his gate and saw how scattered glowing balls had already set the dry grass alight between his house and the neighbor's. For a few long-drawn-out seconds he evaluated the situation as best he could: the fire would be all over his house in a few minutes if he didn't charge off to get the water hose at once. He saw the elderly man trying to push his way past an overturned bookcase on his way into the house. The suits shouted his name and tried to make him stop, but the elderly man's wife was screaming out another name.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维花了漫长的几秒钟来判断整个局面。他迎风站在门口，看到零星的火球已经点着了他的房子和邻居之间的干草。要是不马上抄起灭火器，不要几分钟，他的房子就会淹没在火海中。他看到老人正试图推开倾覆的书橱，强行冲进自己的房子。领带们呼喊着他的名字，试图阻止他，但老人的太太唤着另一个名字。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ove rocked on his heels as he watched the embers stealing their way through the grass. In all honesty he was probably not thinking so much about what he wanted to do, but about what his father would have done. And as soon as that thought had taken root there was not much choice about it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维挪了挪脚踝，把重心从一只脚换到另一只，看着火光沿着草地蔓延。他实际上并不是在考虑自己应该做什么，而是在想父亲会怎么做。既然有了这个想法，下一步也就别无选择了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He muttered, irritated, looking at his house a last time, instinctively calculating to himself how many hours it had taken to build it. And then he ran towards the fire.</div>

<div class="line_en">Still wearing only his underpants and with aching lungs, Ove saw the first flames climbing his own house. He charged across the lawn but was immediately stopped by a group of firemen. They were everywhere, all of a sudden. Refused to let him through.</div>

<div class="line_en">The house was so filled with thick, sticky smoke that it was like being struck in the face with a shovel. The elderly man struggled to move the fallen bookcase, which was blocking a door. Ove threw it aside as if it were made of paper and cleared a way up the stairs. By the time they emerged into the light of dawn, the elderly man was carrying the boy in his soot-covered arms. Ove had long, bleeding grazes across his chest and arms.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="房子里都是浓烟，这感觉就像迎面袭来一把铁铲。老人还在挣扎着抬那个挡着门的书橱。欧维一把挪开，就像那是纸做的，就这样清出了通向楼梯的道路。他们再次出现在晨光下的时候，老人怀抱着满身灰尘的小男孩。欧维的胸口和手臂上都是淌着血的伤口。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A man in a white shirt, some sort of chief fireman as Ove understood it, stood before him with his legs wide apart and explained that they couldn't let him try to extinguish the fire in his own house. It was much too dangerous. Unfortunately, the white shirt explained after that, the fire brigade could not put it out either until they had the appropriate permissions from the authorities.</div>

<div class="line_en">When a few hours later he stood in a telephone booth calling the insurance company, he learned that they had never heard of the jovial man with the round face. There was no valid insurance policy on the house.
