<div class="line_en">Tim Snedden, known as the Rustler, was the owner of a string of shopping malls that stretched over the northern part of the state of California. He was also a Las Vegas high roller who usually stayed at the Xanadu. He was particularly fond of and extraordinarily lucky at sports betting. The Rustler made big bets, fifty grand on football and sometimes ten grand on basketball. Thinking he was being clever, he lost small bets but almost invariably won his big bets. Cross was on to that immediately.</div>

<div class="line_en">Cross De Lena pleaded for Big Tim's life for many different reasons. One, he contributed between five hundred grand and one million to the Xanadu cage every year. Second, he had a sneaking affection for the man, for his lust for life, his outrageous buffooneries.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克罗斯·德·莱纳之所以想保住大蒂姆的性命，是有许多原因的。其一，他每年都在桃源酒店消费五十万到一百万；其二，他很喜欢这个人，因为这个人活得实在是有滋有味，总有一大堆让人哭笑不得的小花招。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Rustler was very big, nearly six and a half feet and over three hundred fifty pounds. His appetite matched his physique, he ate everything in sight. He boasted he had had a partial stomach bypass so that food passed directly through his system and he never gained weight. He was gleeful about this as an ultimate scam on nature itself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“偷牛贼”人高马大，身高差不多有六英尺半，体重超过三百五十磅。他的胃口也配得上他这副身材，看到什么吃什么。他逢人便说，自己做过胃分流术，所以食物直接流下去，体重却永远不增加。这件事他感到洋洋得意，这是蒙骗了自然规律。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Though he was very lucky with his sports gambling, the Rustler was less fortunate with casino games. He was skillful, he knew the odds and bet correctly, but his natural exuberance carried him away, and his winnings on sports would be wiped out and more. So it wasn't because of the money but because of long-range strategic reasons that the Clericuzio took an interest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽然体育博彩上他运气好得很，赌场里边的花样儿他就没那么走运了。他技术很娴熟，了解赔率，下注也准。但是他就是天生好赌，把他从体育博彩上赢的钱赔光了都不够。所以，克莱里库齐奥家族对他发生了兴趣，不是钱的关系，而是一种长期策略的原因。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For the Rustler was a natural-born scam artist, which was how he earned his nickname. At the Xanadu he fed his friends free under his comp, he absolutely destroyed room service. He tried to pay his call girls and the purchases at the gift shop under his comp. And then when he lost and had a cage full of markers, he stalled payment until his next visit to the Xanadu, instead of paying them within a month as a gentleman gambler would do.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“偷牛贼”生下来就是个骗子，他这个外号就是这么来的。在桃源酒店，他用免费待遇招待朋友，把房间服务折腾得一塌糊涂。他还想把付给应召女郎的钱和花在礼品店的钱都混入免费待遇里。他输钱的时候，欠酒店一大笔债，一直拖到下次再来桃源酒店的时候才还钱。守规矩的赌客们都是在一个月内就把账还清的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Since the Family's ultimate goal was the legalization of sports gambling all over the United States, any gambling scandal involving sports would hurt that aim. So an inquiry into the life of Big Tim Snedden the Rustler was launched. The results were so alarming that Pippi and Cross were summoned East to the mansion in Quogue for a conference. It was Pippi's first operation after his return from Sicily.</div>

<div class="line_en">Pippi and Cross took the flight back East together. Cross worried that the Clericuzio had already found out about his movie deal on Messalina and that his father would be angry he had not been consulted. For Pippi, at fifty-seven, though retired, still was consigliere to his son the Bruglione.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="皮皮和克罗斯一起搭上了飞往东部的班机。克罗斯担心克莱里库齐奥家族已经知道了他买下了电影《梅莎琳娜》，他也怕爸爸生气，因为他没有征询他的意见。五十七岁的皮皮尽管已经退休，仍然在为担任代理人的儿子充当顾问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Pippi listened without saying a word, then sighed with disgust. "You're still too young," he said. "It won't be about the movie deal. The Don would never show his hand this quick. He'd wait to see what happened. It looks like Giorgio runs things, that's what Vincent and Petie and Dante think. But they're wrong. The old man is smarter than all of us. And don't worry about him, he's always fair in these things. It's Giorgio and Dante you have to worry about." He paused for a moment as if reluctant to talk about the Family even with Cross.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="皮皮一言不发地听他说完，然后嫌恶地叹了口气。“你还是太年轻了呀。”他说，“跟电影交易没关系。唐不会那么快下手的。他会等，看看接下来的形势。文森特、佩蒂耶和丹特都认为乔治在打理家族事务。但是他们错了。唐比我们谁都精明。不过别担心他，这类的事情他一向很公正。你要担心的是乔治和丹特。”他顿了顿，似乎不愿意谈论家族的这些事情，哪怕面对克罗斯也是一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So on the plane Cross told his father about the movie and reassured him that he still valued his counsel but had not wanted to put him in a bad light with the Clericuzio. He also voiced his anxiety about being summoned back East because the Don had learned about his Hollywood plans.</div>

<div class="line_en">"You notice that Giorgio and Vincent and Petie's kids know nothing about Family business? The Don and Giorgio have all planned that the children will be strictly legit. The Don planned that for Dante too, but Dante was too smart, figured everything out, and he wanted in. The Don couldn't stop him. Think of all of us -- Giorgio, Vincent, and Petie, you and me and Dante -- as the rear guard, fighting so that the Clericuzio clan can escape to safety. That's the Don's planning. It's his strength, what makes him great. So he may even be glad you're making your escape, it's what he hoped Dante would do. That's what it is, isn't it?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你注意到没有，乔治、文森特和佩蒂耶的孩子对家族的生意一无所知？唐和乔治已经计划好了，这些孩子绝不能犯法。唐打算让丹特也过这样的生活。但是丹特太聪明了，他弄清楚了所有的事，而且他想加入。唐也拦不住他。看看我们所有这些人——乔治、文森特、佩蒂耶、你、我，还有丹特——我们都是后卫，我们拼死拼活，为的就是让克莱里库齐奥家族能跑到安全地带去。这就是唐的计划。他有这个力量，这是他伟大之处。所以你要是也打算金盆洗手，他甚至会很高兴。他希望丹特也能这样。不是吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Giorgio laid it out. An investigation had shown that Rustler Snedden was fixing certain college games in the Midwest.

Buckets of twelve different kinds of ice cream were buried like submarines. Then there was a passageway of hot dishes: a baron of beef as big as a buffalo, a huge turkey, a white, fat-ringed ham.

There had been many important men of the world who had been guests at the Hotel. Nobel Prize-winning scientists, billionaires, great religious revivalists, eminent literary icons. A Nobel Prize-winner in physics, the best brain maybe in the world, had frolicked with a whole line of chorus girls during his six-day stay. He didn't gamble much but it was an honor for the Hotel. Gronevelt himself had to give gifts to each of the girls, it had never occurred to the Nobel Prize-winner to do so. The girls had reported he was the best screw in the world, eager, ardent, and skillful, no tricks, with one of the most beautiful cocks they had ever seen. And best of all, amusing, never boring them with serious talk. As gossipy and bitchy as any of the girls. For some reason this cheered Gronevelt up. That such a brain could please the opposite sex. Not like Ernest Vail, such a great writer but a middle-aged kid with a perpetual hard-on and no small talk to go with it. Then there was Senator Wavven, a possible future president of the United States, who treated sex like a game of golf. To say nothing of the dean of Yale, the cardinal of Chicago, the leader of the Civil Rights National Committee, and the crusty Republican bigwigs. All of them reduced to children by pussy. The only possible exceptions were the gays or druggies, but after all they were not typically gamblers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="首先，格罗内韦尔特高度评价了“屄的重要性”，这是他自己编的词。屄能战胜任何事情。甚至可以让一个嗜赌如命的人改过自新。酒店的住客里曾经有过各种世界级的大人物：获得了诺贝尔奖的科学家、亿万富翁、宗教信仰复兴运动的先驱者，还有文坛巨匠。曾经有个诺贝尔物理学奖的获得者，也许算是世界上最聪明的人了，在酒店住了六天，跟一大群舞女颠鸾倒凤。虽然他没怎么赌，但他的莅临就是赌场的荣耀。格罗内韦尔特亲自给每个姑娘都送去了一份礼物，这位诺贝尔奖得主都没想到要这样做。姑娘们反馈说，这个人的床上功夫世界第一，激情、生猛，技艺娴熟，不耍花样，她们几乎没见过这么漂亮的鸡巴。最妙的是，他魅力无穷，从来不拿一本正经的话题烦她们。他跟这些姑娘一样，爱闲聊、爱八卦。出于某种原因，这个消息让格罗内韦尔特振奋不已。这种聪明人竟然也懂得取悦异性。不像大作家厄内斯特·维尔，人到中年了还像个孩子，只是硬着一根鸡巴，连调情都不会。还有维文参议员，说不定能当未来的美国总统，却把性爱看得跟打高尔夫球一样。更不用说耶鲁大学里学院的院长、芝加哥教区的红衣主教、美国民权委员会的领袖，还有共和党里那些乖戾的显贵们了。这些人见到了屄，马上变成了三岁小孩儿。只有同性恋和瘾君子不会拜倒在屄下，不过反正这些人也不会是什么赌客，无所谓了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Gronevelt noted that male gamblers called for hookers before they set out to gamble. Women, however, preferred sex after they gambled. Since the Hotel had to cater to the sexual needs of everyone and there were no male hookers, just gigolos, the Hotel used barmen croupiers and junior pit boys for the women, and that was their report. So Gronevelt made a jump. Males need sex to prepare them to go into battle with confidence. Women need sex to assuage the sorrow of losing or as part of the reward for their victory.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克罗内维尔特注意到，男赌客们一般都是先招妓，然后才去赌钱；而女人呢，则更喜欢先赌钱，后做爱。酒店必须满足每一个人的性需求，可是酒店里又没有男妓，只有吃软饭的小白脸，所以酒店就用起了酒吧招待、低级荷官来满足女人的需要。男女的这种差别就是他们反馈上来的。由此，格罗内韦尔特得出了一个结论：男人的性爱是踏上战场之前的热身；而女人的性爱则是失败后的慰藉，或是胜利后的奖赏。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was true that Big Tim called for a hooker an hour before his party and then went to bed with his two waitresses in the early morning after losing a big sum of money. They were reluctant, they were straight girls. Big Tim solved the problem in his own particular way. He put up ten thousand dollars worth of black chips and told them it was theirs if they spent the night with him. Accompanied with his usual vague promise of more if they had a really good night. He loved the way they studied the chips thoughtfully before agreeing. The joke was they got him so drunk that he fell asleep, gorged with food and drink, before he got past the fondling stage. He fell asleep between the two of them, his huge frame pushing them to the edges, both girls clinging to him until finally they fell on the floor to sleep.</div>

<div class="line_en">Since they were recognizable to most Americans, they had to disguise themselves. This proved to be extraordinarily easy to do. They used wigs to change the style and color of their hair. They used makeup, thickened their lips or thinned them. They dressed in the style of middle-class women. They downgraded their beauty, which didn't matter because, like most actresses, they could be enormously charming. And they delighted in the role playing. They loved to listen to different kinds of men bare their hearts to them in hope of getting into bed with them, often successfully. It was a breath of real life, the characters still mysterious, not doomed to a written script. And there were delightful surprises. Sincere offers of marriage and true love; men sharing their pain because they thought they would never see them again. The admiration they received not because of their hidden status, but because of their innate charms. And they loved creating new personas for themselves. Sometimes they would be computer operators on vacation, sometimes off-duty nurses or dental technicians or social workers. They would bone up for their parts by reading about their new professions. Sometimes they would pretend to be legal secretaries in the office of a big showbiz lawyer in L. A. and spread scandal about their own husbands and other of their actor friends. They had great times but always went out of town; Los Angeles was too dangerous, they might run into friends who would easily recognize them despite their disguise. They discovered that San Francisco was also risky. Some gay men seemed to know their true identity at a glance. Their favorite place was Las Vegas.</div>

They were attracted to him because they had watched him gamble and lose enormous amounts of money with his unlimited credit. After the drinks, he took them to the roulette wheel and staked them each to a thousand dollars' worth of chips. They were charmed by his hat and the extravagant courtesy showed to him by the croupiers and the pit boss. And his sly charm, which was touched by a vicious humor. Dante was witty in a vulgar and sometimes chilling way. And the extravagance of his gambling excited them. Of course they themselves were rich, they earned enormous amounts of money, but his was hard cash and that had its own magic. Certainly they had spent tens of thousands on Rodeo Drive in one day, but they had received luxurious goods in return.

<div class="line_en">First danger: In this Boz operation he was making a crucial move without consulting the Clericuzio Family. It was true that he was the administrative Baron of the Western District, which comprised Nevada and the southern part of California. It was true that the Barons operated independently in many areas and were not strictly under the Clericuzio Family as long as they wet the Clericuzio beak with a percentage of earnings. But there were very strict rules. No Baron, or Bruglione, could embark on an operation of such magnitude without the approval of the Clericuzio. For one simple reason. If a Baron did so and got into trouble, he would receive no prosecutorial indulgence, no judicial intervention. In addition, he would receive no support against any rising chief in his own territories, and his money would not be laundered and tucked away for his old age. Cross knew he should see Giorgio and the Don for an OK.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第一个危险：这是他没有征询家族的意见而作出的重要决定。他确实是家族在西部的代理人，内华达州和加州南部都是他的势力范围，在一定程度上他可以独立行动，不必事事请示，只要给克莱里库齐奥家族上交一部分收入就可以了。但是也有严格的规定。“代理人”在没有得到克莱里库齐奥家族许可的情况下，绝不允许开展如此重大的行动。原因很简单：一旦失手，检察官是不会放过他的，也不会有人干预司法。除此之外，在对付自己领土上的后起之秀时，他不会得到任何援助；没有渠道给他洗钱，也没有钱让他养老。克罗斯知道，他应该去见乔治和唐，征求他们的同意。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This operation could be enormously sensitive. And he was putting up part of his 51 percent equity in the Xanadu, left to him by Gronevelt, to finance the movie deal.

It was a peculiar and yet somehow very human quirk of the Clericuzio that they felt a proprietary interest in the fortunes of their subordinates. They would resent his investing this money without their advice. Their quirk, though it had no legal foundation, resembled a medieval courtesy: no baron could sell his castle without royal consent.</div>

<div class="line_en">Now the Clericuzio sent Pippi De Lena to Sicily every year to recruit men to live in the Bronx Enclave and soldier for the Clericuzio Family. The bedrock of the Don's faith was that only Sicilians with their centuries-long tradition of omerta could be trusted not to turn traitor. The young men in America were too soft, too lightheaded with vanity, could be too easily turned into informants by the more ferocious of the district attorneys who were sending so many of the Brugliones to prison.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克莱里库齐奥家族每年都派皮皮·德·莱纳去西西里岛为布朗克斯的地盘招募。这是因为唐坚信，只有西西里人，数百年来恪守缄默规则，才信得过，不会成为叛徒。美国的年轻人软弱又虚荣，地方检察官轻而易举地就能把他们变成警方的线人，然后把许多代理人关进监狱。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The magistrate traveled to the big towns in Sicily to gather evidence and issue arrest warrants. He was scheduled to return to Palermo to be given a medal for his heroic attempt to rid the island of its Mafia scourge. Lia Vazzi and his men mined a small bridge that the magistrate had to pass over. The magistrate and his guards were blown into such tiny bits that the bodies had to be brought out of the water with sieves. The government in Rome, infuriated, replied with a massive search for the culprits responsible, and Vazzi had to go underground. Though the government had no proof, he knew that if he fell into their hands he would be better off dead.</div>

<div class="line_en">As a philosophy, omerta was quite simple. It was a mortal sin to talk to the police about anything that would harm the Mafia. If a rival Mafia clan murdered your father before your eyes, you were forbidden to inform the police. If you yourself were shot and lay dying, you were forbidden to inform the police. If they stole your mule, your goat, your jewelry, you were forbidden to go to the police. The authorities were the Great Satan a true Sicilian could never turn to. Family and the Mafia were the avengers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="作为一种为人处世的方式，缄默规则非常简单。对警察讲出任何不利于黑手党的事情都是死罪。如果敌对黑手党当着你的面杀了你父亲，你也不许报警。如果你中了枪、奄奄一息，你也不许报警。如果他们偷了你的骡子、你的山羊、你的珠宝，你也不许报警。政府当局就是地狱大魔王，一个真正的西西里人永远不会去寻求他们的帮助。为你报仇雪恨的是家族和黑手党。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The house had a pleasant garden with fig and olive and lemon trees, and it was here that Pippi did his interviews. The garden strangely resembled the Clericuzio garden in Quogue, except for the brilliantly colored flowers and the lemon trees. The mayor was obviously a man who loved beauty, for in addition he had a comely wife and three lusciously pretty daughters who, though in their early teens, were fully developed women.</div>

<div class="line_en">Over the next few days men came to be interviewed and screened by Pippi. He had criteria. The men could not be older than thirty-five or younger than twenty. If they were married, they could not have more than one child. Finally, they had to be vouched for by the mayor. He explained this. If the men were too young, they might be too influenced by the American culture. If they were too old, they could not make the adjustment to America. If they had more than one child, they would be of too cautious a temperament to take the risks their duties would demand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="之后的几天，皮皮筛选着面试的人。他有自己的一套标准。不能超过三十五岁，也不能小于二十岁。要是结婚了，只能有一个孩子。最后，镇长要为他们担保。他解释道，太年轻，就容易被美国文化过分影响；太老就适应不了美国。孩子多了，就会变得谨小慎微，担不起完成任务所需要的风险。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But Cross saw that his father, Pippi, was a different man in Sicily. There was none of his carefree gallantry here, he was soberly respectful to the women, his charm erased.

You screw one of their daughters, we'll never get out of here alive."</div>
