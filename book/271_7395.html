<div class="line_en">"Of course no one would," he assured me again. "Her diet… well, she prefers to drink blood.

<div class="line_en">"Why is Jacob still here?" I asked. "How can he stand it? Why should he?" My ringing voice trembled a little. "Why should he have to suffer more?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“为什么雅各布还在这里？”我问：“他怎么可能忍受这一切？他怎么做到的？”我铃铛般的声音微微颤抖着，“为什么他还要忍受这一切？！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Jacob isn't suffering," he said in a strange new tone. "Though I might be willing to change his condition," Edward added through his teeth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，雅各布并没有忍受什么，”他语气古怪的说：“我倒是很想改变他现在的情况。”爱德华咬牙切齿的加了一句。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Edward!" I hissed, yanking him to a stop (and feeling a little thrill of smugness that I was able to do it).</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你待会就知道我为什么要这么说了，”爱德华带点神秘的抱怨着：“我答应过他让他自己来解释的，但我很怀疑你的反应跟我会完全不一样。要知道，我经常搞错你的想法，不是吗？”他撅着嘴，撇了下我。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Edward shook his head. "I promised. Though I don't know if I really owe him anything at all anymore…" His teeth ground together.</div>

<div class="line_en">"How can you say that? Jacob has given up everything to protect us! What I've put him through --!" I cringed at the dim memory of shame and guilt. It seemed odd now that I had needed him so much then. That sense of absence without him near had vanished; it must have been a human weakness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你怎么能这么说？雅各布前几天才为了保护我们而放弃了几乎所有东西！天，我让他遭到了什么啊——！”我为脑中可耻又内疚的模糊记忆而辩护道。现在看起来当时我对他的需要，多的有点奇怪。他不在身边而产生的空虚感已经消失了，可能那只是人类身上的弱点。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He stroked my cheek and then smiled gently when my face smoothed out in response, desire momentarily overruling annoyance. "It's harder than you make it look, I know. I remember."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他轻抚着我的脸颊，温柔的笑着，让我脸慢慢软化下来，对他的渴望暂时战胜了这些烦人的事。“我知道，这有点困难，我都记得。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I know. And so let's get you home, so that you can see it all for yourself." His eyes ran over the remains of my dress as he spoke of going home, and he frowned. "Hmm." After a half second of thought, he unbuttoned his white shirt and held it out for me to put my arms through.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我明白，所以我们快点回去吧，那样你就可以自己去看看了。”提起回家，他目光扫过我那可怜的裙子，眉毛皱起来了：“嗯……”想了不到半秒，他把自己的白衬衫脱了下来，帮我穿上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“有这么糟糕吗？”他诡异的笑了笑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I slipped my arms into his sleeves and then buttoned it swiftly over my ragged bodice. Of course, that left him without a shirt, and it was impossible not to find that distracting.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="快速的把衣服套在我破破烂烂的裙子上，扣好扣子。现在，他裸着上半身——对我来说是很大的诱惑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jacob stood at the line where the forest touched the Cullens' lawn, his arms folded across his body, his jaw clenched tight. Invisible in the woods behind him, I heard now two larger hearts, and the faint crush of bracken under huge, pacing paws.</div>

<div class="line_en">What was with Edward? After all that we'd been through, shouldn't he have been able to feel some kindness for my best friend? I'd thought -- maybe foolishly -- that Edward was sort of Jacob's friend now, too. I must have misread them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱德华到底怎么了？经过所有的这些痛苦，他不应该对我最好的朋友友好点吗？我还以为——真是白痴——还以为现在爱德华和雅各布两人应该有某种程度的友谊了。我肯定是误会什么了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I glanced at his face anxiously; Edward seemed to deliberate for a moment, and then his expression twisted from concern into something else. He shrugged, and there was an undercurrent of hostility in his voice when he said, "It's your neck, I guess."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我焦急的望着他，爱德华低头考虑了一会儿，突然表情变得非常古怪像是想到了什么。他耸耸肩，带点恶意的说：“反正到时受伤的是你。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This was a test? To see if I could not kill Jacob before I tried to not kill Renesmee? I felt sick in the strangest way -- it had nothing to do with my stomach, only my mind. Was this Edward's idea?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是个考验吗？在我控制自己不去伤害蕾妮斯梅之前，先看看我能不能控制住自己不去伤害雅各布？我觉得这种奇怪的方式让人很恶心——并不是身体上的恶心，而是精神上的。这是爱德华的主意吗？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then he smiled his familiar smile, the smile of a kindred spirit, and I was sure our friendship was intact. It was just like before, when we were hanging out in his homemade garage, just two friends killing time. Easy and normal.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着他脸上露出熟悉的微笑，一个家人般的鼓励的笑容，我现在能确定了我们的友谊并没有消失。还跟原来我们偷偷的在他的个人修理厂里捣鼓时一样，只是朋友之间打发时间的方式。简单而平常。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It still made no sense what he was doing now, though. Was he really so selfless that he would try to protect me -- with his own life -- from doing something in an uncontrolled split second that I would regret in agony forever? That went way beyond simply tolerating what I had become, or miraculously managing to stay my friend. Jacob was one of the best people I knew, but this seemed like too much to accept from anyone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但这还是解释不了他现在正做的事。他是个圣人吗？无私到要用自己的生命来阻止我可能的失控下做的绝对会后悔一生的行为？这不仅仅是忍受我变成吸血鬼这种事了，雅各布是我认识的最好的人，但是这种奉献对谁来说都太多了，远远超过我能接受的范围。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His grin widened, and he shuddered slightly. "I gotta say it, Bells. You're a freak show."</div>

It was actually easier with the smell to temper my reaction to the sound and heat of his pulsing blood.</div>
