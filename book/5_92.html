<div class="line_en">In sixth grade she'd had two best friends; they'd done everything together -- showed their horses in 4-H, gone to youth group, and ridden their bikes from one house to the next. The summer they turned twelve, all that ended. Her friends went wild; there was no other way to put it. They smoked pot before school and skipped classes and never missed a party. When she wouldn't join in, they cut her loose. Period. And the "good" kids wouldn't come near her because she'd been part of the stoners' club. So now books were her only friends. She'd read Lord of the Rings so often she could recite whole scenes by memory.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="六年级时她有两个好朋友，她们做什么都在一起，一起参加青年会的马术比赛，一起加入少年团体、骑着脚踏车互相串门子，但十二岁那年夏天，这段友谊画下了句点。那两个女生变得很野，没有其他方式可以形容。她们在上学前抽大麻，经常逃课，到处参加派对，她不肯加入，于是她们绝交了，就这样。因为她曾经和嗑药的人来往，所以学校里的“好”孩子排斥她，现在她的朋友只剩书本，她反复读了《魔戒》好几遍，甚至能背出整段场景。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">With a sigh, she got out of bed. In the tiny upstairs closet that had recently been turned into a bathroom, she took a quick shower and braided her straight blond hair, then put on her spazo horn-rimmed glasses. They were hopelessly out of date now -- round and rimless were what the cool kids wore -- but her dad said they couldn't afford new glasses yet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她叹着气下床。楼上的小储藏室不久前改装成浴室，她迅速洗了澡，将直金发编成辫子，戴上蠢到家的角框眼镜。这副眼镜老土毙了，圆形无框眼镜才够酷，可是爸爸说现在没钱给她配新眼镜。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Downstairs, she went to the back door, folded her belled pant leg around each calf, and stepped into the huge black rubber boots they kept on the concrete steps. Moving like Neil Armstrong, she made her way through the deep mud to the shed out back. Their old quarterhorse mare limped up to the fence, whinnied a greeting. "Heya, Sweetpea," Kate said, throwing a flake of hay onto the ground, and then scratching the horse's velvety ear.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她下楼到后门，将喇叭裤的裤管贴腿折好，穿上放在水泥阶梯上的超大黑色雨靴。她以月球漫步般的动作踏过深深泥泞到后面的马棚，他们的老母马一拐一拐地来到围栏前，嘶鸣着打招呼。“嗨，甜豆。”凯蒂撒下一把秣料，搔搔马儿细柔的耳朵。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When she opened the back door, she stepped into pandemonium. Mom stood at the stove, dressed in her faded floral housedress and fuzzy pink slippers, smoking an Eve menthol cigarette and pouring batter into an oblong electric frying pan. Her shoulder-length brown hair was divided into two scrawny pigtails; each one was held in place by a strand of hot-pink ribbon. "Set the table, Katie," she said without glancing up. "Sean! Get down here."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一打开后门，便可见屋里乱得天翻地覆。妈妈一身褪色印花家居服，脚踩粉红毛拖鞋，叼着夏娃凉烟站在炉子前，将面糊倒进长方形煎盘。她将长度及肩的棕发绑成单薄双马尾，以桃红色缎带固定。“凯蒂，准备餐具。”她头也没抬，“尚恩！快下来！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She hid in her bedroom until she heard the old Ford station wagon start up. The last thing she wanted was to get driven to school by her mom, who yelled goodbye and waved like a contestant on The Price Is Right when Kate got out of the car. Everyone knew it was social suicide to be driven to school by your parents. When she heard tires crunching slowly across gravel, she went back downstairs, washed the dishes, gathered her stuff, and left the house. Outside, the sun was shining, but last night's rain had studded the driveway with inner-tube-sized potholes. No doubt the old-timers down at the hardware store were already starting to talk about the flooding. Mud sucked at the soles of her fake Earth shoes, making her progress slow. So intent was she on saving her only rainbow socks that she was at the bottom of the driveway before she noticed the girl standing across the street.</div>
