<div class="line_en">The Rat put out a neat little brown paw, gripped Toad firmly by the scruff of the neck, and gave a great hoist and a pull; and the water-logged Toad came up slowly but surely over the edge of the hole, till at last he stood safe and sound in the hall, streaked with mud and weed to be sure, and with the water streaming off him, but happy and high-spirited as of old, now that he found himself once more in the house of a friend, and dodgings and evasions were over, and he could lay aside a disguise that was unworthy of his position and wanted such a lot of living up to.</div>

<div class="line_en">'Toad,' said the Water Rat, gravely and firmly, 'you go off upstairs at once, and take off that old cotton rag that looks as if it might formerly have belonged to some washerwoman, and clean yourself thoroughly, and put on some of my clothes, and try and come down looking like a gentleman if you CAN; for a more shabby, bedraggled, disreputable-looking object than you are I never set eyes on in my whole life! Now, stop swaggering and arguing, and be off! I'll have something to say to you later!'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“蟾蜍，”河鼠说，态度严肃又坚定，“你马上给我上楼去，脱掉身上这件破布衫，这衣裳像是一个洗衣妇穿过的＿好好洗刷干净，换上我的衣服，再下楼来，看能不能像个绅士的样子。我这辈子还没见过一个比你更寒碜、邋遢、丢人现眼的家伙！好啦，别吹牛，别争辩，快去吧！呆会儿，我有话对你说！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Toad was at first inclined to stop and do some talking back at him. He had had enough of being ordered about when he was in prison, and here was the thing being begun all over again, apparently; and by a Rat, too! However, he caught sight of himself in the looking-glass over the hat-stand, with the rusty black bonnet perched rakishly over one eye, and he changed his mind and went very quickly and humbly upstairs to the Rat's dressing-room. There he had a thorough wash and brush-up, changed his clothes, and stood for a long time before the glass, contemplating himself with pride and pleasure, and thinking what utter idiots all the people must have been to have ever mistaken him for one moment for a washerwoman.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="蟾蜍起初不愿就此住口，还想回敬他几句。坐牢的时候，他就老是被人支来使去，他受够了，现在又来了，而且支使他的是一只老鼠！不过。他偶然从帽架上的镜子里，瞥见了自己的尊容，一顶褪色的黑色女帽，俏皮地歪扣在一只眼上，他立刻改变了主意，二话没说，乖乖地上了楼，钻进了河鼠的穿衣室。他彻头彻尾洗刷了一遍，换了衣服，久久地站在镜子跟前，沾沾自喜地欣赏着自己，心想，那帮家伙竟会错把他当成一个洗衣妇，真是一群白痴！">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">By the time he came down again luncheon was on the table, and very glad Toad was to see it, for he had been through some trying experiences and had taken much hard exercise since the excellent breakfast provided for him by the gipsy. While they ate Toad told the Rat all his adventures, dwelling chiefly on his own cleverness, and presence of mind in emergencies, and cunning in tight places; and rather making out that he had been having a gay and highly-coloured experience. But the more he talked and boasted, the more grave and silent the Rat became.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他下楼时，午饭已经摆在桌上。蟾蜍看见午饭，心里好高兴，因为自吃过吉卜赛人那顿丰盛的早餐之后，他又经历了不少险情，消耗了大量的体力。吃午饭时，蟾蜍向河鼠叙述他的全部历险，着重谈他自己如何聪明机警，他在危急关头如何从容镇定，身处困境时如何机敏狡诘。他把这一切说得仿佛是一段轻松愉快丰富多采的奇遇。但他越是夸夸其谈，河鼠就越是神情严肃，沉默不语。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When at last Toad had talked himself to a standstill, there was silence for a while; and then the Rat said, 'Now, Toady, I don't want to give you pain, after all you've been through already; but, seriously, don't you see what an awful ass you've been making of yourself? On your own admission you have been handcuffed, imprisoned, starved, chased, terrified out of your life, insulted, jeered at, and ignominiously flung into the water-by a woman, too! Where's the amusement in that? Where does the fun come in? And all because you must needs go and steal a motor-car. You know that you've never had anything but trouble from motor-cars from the moment you first set eyes on one. But if you WILL be mixed up with them-as you generally are, five minutes after you've started-why STEAL them? Be a cripple, if you think it's exciting; be a bankrupt, for a change, if you've set your mind on it: but why choose to be a convict? When are you going to be sensible, and think of your friends, and try and be a credit to them? Do you suppose it's any pleasure to me, for instance, to hear animals saying, as I go about, that I'm the chap that keeps company with gaol-birds?'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="蟾蜍讲呀讲呀，终于打住了。接着是片刻的沉默，然后河鼠开腔了。“好了，老蟾，我本不想使你难过，不管怎么说，你吃过不少苦头。不过，说老实话，难道你看不出，你把自己变成了一头蠢驴吗？你自己承认，你被捕入狱，挨饿受冻，受到追捕，吓得死去活来，蒙受屈辱，遭到嘲弄，被扔进河里——而且是被一个女人！这有什么好玩的？哪来的乐趣？归根到底，都因为你硬要去偷一辆汽车。你很清楚，打从你头一眼见到汽车，除了不断地惹祸，什么好处你也没捞到。要是你非玩汽车不可——你向来就是这样，只要玩开了头，就上瘾——那又何必去偷呢？要是你觉得残废了有趣，那就落个残废好啦。要是你想尝尝破产的滋味，那就去破一次产好啦。可为什么偏偏要去犯罪？你什么时候才变得明白些，替你的朋友们想想，为他们争口气？我出门在外。听到别的动物在背后议论，说我的哥们是个罪犯，你想我会好受吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Now, it was a very comforting point in Toad's character that he was a thoroughly good-hearted animal and never minded being jawed by those who were his real friends. And even when most set upon a thing, he was always able to see the other side of the question. So although, while the Rat was talking so seriously, he kept saying to himself mutinously, 'But it WAS fun, though! Awful fun!' and making strange suppressed noises inside him, k-i-ck-ck-ck, and poop-p-p, and other sounds resembling stifled snorts, or the opening of soda-water bottles, yet when the Rat had quite finished, he heaved a deep sigh and said, very nicely and humbly, 'Quite right, Ratty! How SOUND you always are! Yes, I've been a conceited old ass, I can quite see that; but now I'm going to be a good Toad, and not do it any more. As for motor-cars, I've not been at all so keen about them since my last ducking in that river of yours. The fact is, while I was hanging on to the edge of your hole and getting my breath, I had a sudden idea-a really brilliant idea-connected with motor-boats-there, there! don't take on so, old chap, and stamp, and upset things; it was only an idea, and we won't talk any more about it now. We'll have our coffee, AND a smoke, and a quiet chat, and then I'm going to stroll quietly down to Toad Hall, and get into clothes of my own, and set things going again on the old lines. I've had enough of adventures. I shall lead a quiet, steady, respectable life, pottering about my property, and improving it, and doing a little landscape gardening at times. There will always be a bit of dinner for my friends when they come to see me; and I shall keep a pony-chaise to jog about the country in, just as I used to in the good old days, before I got restless, and wanted to DO things.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="蟾蜍的性格，有一点是足以令人宽慰的，那就是，他确实是一只善良的动物，从不计较真正朋友的唠叨数落。即使他执迷于什么，他也能看到问题的另一面。在河鼠严厉地开导他时，他私下里还在嘟哝：“可那确实好玩，好玩得要命！”并且压低了嗓门，发出一些古怪的噪音，克——克——克，噗——噗——噗，以及类似沉闷的鼾声或者开汽水瓶的声音。不过。当河鼠快要说完时。他却深深叹了口气，非常温和谦逊地说：“太对了。鼠兄！你的理由老是那么充足！是啊，我曾经是一头狂妄自大的蠢驴，这点我算明白了；不过现在我要做一只好蟾蜍，再也不干蠢事了。至于汽车嘛、自从我掉进你的河里以后，我对它已经不大感兴趣了。事实是，在我攀住你的洞口喘气时，我忽然有了一个新的想法——一个绝妙的想法——是和汽船有关的——好啦，好啦！别发火，老伙计，别跺脚，留神打翻东西；这不过是个想法罢了，咱们现在不去谈它。还是喝杯咖啡，抽支烟，安安静静聊会儿天，然后我就消消停停踱回我的蟾宫，换上我自己的衣服，让一切都恢复老样子。我冒险也冒够了。我要过一种平平稳稳、安安逸逸、正正经经的生活，经营经营我的产业，作些改进；闲时栽花种草，美化环境。朋友们来，总会有饭菜招待。我要备一辆轻便马车，乘上它去四乡转转，就像过去那些好时光那样，再不心浮意躁，总想胡作非为了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">'Well, it was a good deal talked about down here, naturally,' continued the Rat, 'not only along the river-side, but even in the Wild Wood. Animals took sides, as always happens. The River-bankers stuck up for you, and said you had been infamously treated, and there was no justice to be had in the land nowadays. But the Wild Wood animals said hard things, and served you right, and it was time this sort of thing was stopped. And they got very cocky, and went about saying you were done for this time! You would never come back again, never, never!'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“呃，这一带的人自然都议论纷纷，”河鼠接着说。“不光在沿河一带，而且在野林里也一样。动物们照例分成两派。河上的动物都向着你，说你受到不公正的对待，说现如今国内毫无正义可言。可是野林动物却说得很难听，他们说，你是自作自受，罪有应得，现在是制止这类胡作非为的时候了。他们趾高气扬，四下里散布说，这回你可完蛋了，再也回不来了！永远回不来了！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">'They argued from history,' continued the Rat. 'They said that no criminal laws had ever been known to prevail against cheek and plausibility such as yours, combined with the power of a long purse. So they arranged to move their things in to Toad Hall, and sleep there, and keep it aired, and have it all ready for you when you turned up. They didn't guess what was going to happen, of course; still, they had their suspicions of the Wild Wood animals. Now I come to the most painful and tragic part of my story. One dark night-it was a VERY dark night, and blowing hard, too, and raining simply cats and dogs-a band of weasels, armed to the teeth, crept silently up the carriage-drive to the front entrance. Simultaneously, a body of desperate ferrets, advancing through the kitchen-garden, possessed themselves of the backyard and offices; while a company of skirmishing stoats who stuck at nothing occupied the conservatory and the billiard-room, and held the French windows opening on to the lawn.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他们根据历史事实来论证，”河鼠继续说。“他们说，像你这样一个没脸没皮、伶牙俐齿的动物，外加钱袋的力量，没有一条刑法能给你定罪。所以，他俩把自己的铺盖搬进蟾宫，就睡在那儿，经常打开门窗通通风，一切准备停当，只等你回来。当然，他们没有预计到后来发生的事，不过他们总是不放心那些野林动物。现在，我要讲到最痛苦最悲惨的一段了。在一个漆黑的夜里，刮着狂风，下着瓢泼大雨，一帮子黄鼠狼，全副武装。偷偷从大车道爬到大门口。同时，一群穷凶极恶的雪貂，打菜园子那头偷袭上来；占领了后院和下房，还有一伙吵吵闹闹肆无忌惮的白鼬，占领了暖房和弹子房，把守了面对草坪的法式长窗。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">'The Mole and the Badger were sitting by the fire in the smoking-room, telling stories and suspecting nothing, for it wasn't a night for any animals to be out in, when those bloodthirsty villains broke down the doors and rushed in upon them from every side. They made the best fight they could, but what was the good? They were unarmed, and taken by surprise, and what can two animals do against hundreds? They took and beat them severely with sticks, those two poor faithful creatures, and turned them out into the cold and the wet, with many insulting and uncalled-for remarks!'</div>

He would try the boat-house first, he thought. Very warily he paddled up to the mouth of the creek, and was just passing under the bridge, when... CRASH!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他划到能够看见老宅的地方，伏在桨上仔细观察。一切都显得非常宁静，空无一人。他看到蟾宫的整个正面，在夕照下发亮；沿着笔直的屋檐栖息着三三两两的鸽子；花园里百花怒放；通向船坞的小河汊，横跨河汊的小木桥，全都静悄悄，不见人影，似乎在期待他的归来。他想先进船坞试试。他小小翼翼地划进小河汊，刚要从桥下钻过去，只听得——轰隆！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A great stone, dropped from above, smashed through the bottom of the boat. It filled and sank, and Toad found himself struggling in deep water. Looking up, he saw two stoats leaning over the parapet of the bridge and watching him with great glee. 'It will be your head next time, Toady!' they called out to him. The indignant Toad swam to shore, while the stoats laughed and laughed, supporting each other, and laughed again, till they nearly had two fits-that is, one fit each, of course.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一块大石头从桥上落下来，砸穿了船底。船里灌满了水，沉了下去。蟾蜍在深水里挣扎。他抬头看，只见两只白鼬从桥栏杆上探出身来，乐不可支地瞅着他，冲他嚷道：“下回该轮到你的脑袋了，癞蛤蟆！”气忿的蟾蜍向岸边游去，两只白鼬哈哈大笑，笑得抱成一团，跟着又放声大笑，笑得几乎晕过去两次——当然是一只白鼬一次。">查看中文翻译</div>

He came solemnly up to Toad, shook him by the paw, and said, 'Welcome home, Toad! Alas! what am I saying? Home, indeed! This is a poor home-coming. Unhappy Toad!'

<div class="line_en">Toad, of course, went off to bed dutifully with the rest-he knew better than to refuse-though he was feeling much too excited to sleep. But he had had a long day, with many events crowded into it; and sheets and blankets were very friendly and comforting things, after plain straw, and not too much of it, spread on the stone floor of a draughty cell; and his head had not been many seconds on his pillow before he was snoring happily. Naturally, he dreamt a good deal; about roads that ran away from him just when he wanted them, and canals that chased him and caught him, and a barge that sailed into the banqueting-hall with his week's washing, just as he was giving a dinner-party; and he was alone in the secret passage, pushing onwards, but it twisted and turned round and shook itself, and sat up on its end; yet somehow, at the last, he found himself back in Toad Hall, safe and triumphant, with all his friends gathered round about him, earnestly assuring him that he really was a clever Toad.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="蟾蜍自然也乖乖地跟着那两个上床去了——他知道拒绝是没用的——尽管他太兴奋了，毫无睡意。不过，他度过了一个漫长的白天，经历了成堆的事儿，床单被褥毕竟是非常亲切舒适的东西。何况不久前，他还在阴冷潮湿的地牢石板地上的稻草堆里睡过。所以，脑袋一沾枕头。他就幸福地打起鼾来。自然，他做了许多许多梦；梦见他正需要道路时，道路都从身边溜走了；梦见水渠在后面追他，并且抓住了他；梦见他正在大摆宴席，一只拖船驶进了宴会厅，船上满载着他一周要洗的脏衣服；梦见他孤零零一人在秘密通道里跋涉，那通道忽然扭曲了，转过身来，摇晃着坐直了。不过，末末了，他到底还是平安胜利地回到了蟾宫，所有的朋友都围在身边。热情洋溢地赞扬说，他的确是一只聪明的蟾蜍。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He slept till a late hour next morning, and by the time he got down he found that the other animals had finished their breakfast some time before. The Mole had slipped off somewhere by himself, without telling any one where he was going to. The Badger sat in the arm-chair, reading the paper, and not concerning himself in the slightest about what was going to happen that very evening. The Rat, on the other hand, was running round the room busily, with his arms full of weapons of every kind, distributing them in four little heaps on the floor, and saying excitedly under his breath, as he ran, 'Here's-a-sword-for-the-Rat, here's-a-sword-for-the Mole, here's-a-sword-for-the-Toad, here's-a-sword-for-the-Badger!

We four, with our sticks, once we're inside the dining-hall, why, we shall clear the floor of all the lot of them in five minutes.

<div class="line_en">'I should hope so, too,' said the Mole confidently. 'I got the idea when I went into the kitchen, to see about Toad's breakfast being kept hot for him. I found that old washerwoman-dress that he came home in yesterday, hanging on a towel-horse before the fire. So I put it on, and the bonnet as well, and the shawl, and off I went to Toad Hall, as bold as you please. The sentries were on the look-out, of course, with their guns and their "Who comes there?" and all the rest of their nonsense. "Good morning, gentlemen!" says I, very respectful.

A hundred bloodthirsty badgers, armed with rifles, are going to attack Toad Hall this very night, by way of the paddock. Six boatloads of Rats, with pistols and cutlasses, will come up the river and effect a landing in the garden; while a picked body of Toads, known at the Die-hards, or the Death-or-Glory Toads, will storm the orchard and carry everything before them, yelling for vengeance. There won't be much left of you to wash, by the time they've done with you, unless you clear out while you have the chance!" Then I ran away, and when I was out of sight I hid; and presently I came creeping back along the ditch and took a peep at them through the hedge. They were all as nervous and flustered as could be, running all ways at once, and falling over each other, and every one giving orders to everybody else and not listening; and the Sergeant kept sending off parties of stoats to distant parts of the grounds, and then sending other fellows to fetch 'em back again; and I heard them saying to each other, "That's just like the weasels; they're to stop comfortably in the banqueting-hall, and have feasting and toasts and songs and all sorts of fun, while we must stay on guard in the cold and the dark, and in the end be cut to pieces by bloodthirsty Badgers!'"</div>

The Mole was a good listener, and Toad, with no one to check his statements or to criticise in an unfriendly spirit, rather let himself go. Indeed, much that he related belonged more properly to the category of what-might-have-happened-had-I-only-thought-of-it-in-time-instead-of-ten-minutes-afterwards.
