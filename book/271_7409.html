<div class="line_en">At some sign I did not see -- or perhaps there was no sign, only millennia of practice -- the configuration folded outward. The motion was too stiff, too square to resemble the opening of a flower, though the color suggested that; it was the opening of a fan, graceful but very angular. The gray-cloaked figures spread to the flanks while the darker forms surged precisely forward in the center, each movement closely controlled.</div>

<div class="line_en">This was almost my old nightmare. The only thing lacking was the gloating desire I'd seen on the faces in my dream -- the smiles of vindictive joy. Thus far, the Volturi were too disciplined to show any emotion at all. They also showed no surprise or dismay at the collection of vampires that waited for them here -- a collection that looked suddenly disorganized and unprepared in comparison. They showed no surprise at the giant wolf that stood in our midst.</div>

<div class="line_en">I couldn't help counting. There were thirty-two of them. Even if you did not count the two drifting, waifish black-cloaked figures in the very back, who I took to be the wives -- their protected position suggesting that they would not be involved in the attack -- we were still outnumbered. There were just nineteen of us who would fight, and then seven more to watch as we were destroyed. Even counting the ten wolves, they had us.</div>

<div class="line_en">The faces in this seemingly endless influx of vampires were the antithesis to the Volturi's expressionless discipline -- they wore a kaleidoscope of emotions. At first there was the shock and even some anxiety as they saw the unexpected force awaiting them. But that concern passed quickly; they were secure in their overwhelming numbers, secure in their position behind the unstoppable Volturi force. Their features returned to the expression they'd worn before we'd surprised them.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was easy enough to understand their mindset -- the faces were that explicit. This was an angry mob, whipped to a frenzy and slavering for justice. I did not fully realize the vampire world's feeling toward the immortal children before I read these faces.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was clear that this motley, disorganized horde -- more than forty vampires altogether -- was the Volturi's own kind of witness. When we were dead, they would spread the word that the criminals had been eradicated, that the Volturi had acted with nothing but impartiality. Most looked like they hoped for more than just an opportunity to witness -- they wanted to help tear and burn.</div>

<div class="line_en">And then, unexpectedly, two seconds later, the procession did halt. The low music of perfectly synchronized movements turned to silence. The flawless discipline remained unbroken; the Volturi froze into absolute stillness as one. They stood about a hundred yards away from us.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后，过了2秒钟，对面的队伍出乎意料的停止了前进，完美统一的进行曲变成了沉寂。沃尔图里家族完美的纪律没有打破，他们一致的完全静止在那里，在离我们100码左右的地方站住了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"They -- Caius and Aro -- come to destroy and acquire," Edward breathed almost silently back; only our side could hear. "They have many layers of strategy already in place. If Irina's accusation had somehow proven to be false, they were committed to find another reason to take offense. But they can see Renesmee now, so they are perfectly sanguine about their course.

<div class="line_en">On either side of our uneven line, the wolves branched out in long, bordering arms. I only spared a fraction of a second to note that there were more than ten wolves, to recognize the wolves I knew and the ones I'd never seen before. There were sixteen of them spaced evenly around us -- seventeen total, counting Jacob. It was clear from their heights and oversized paws that the newcomers all were very, very young. I supposed I should have foreseen this. With so many vampires encamped in the neighborhood, a werewolf population explosion was inevitable.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在我们参差不齐的阵线两侧，狼群伸长的双臂互相拉着扩散开来。我用了不到一秒钟的时间就注意到狼群里不仅有10只狼，有一些是我认识的，还有一些新面孔。他们中有16只狼整齐的分布在我们周围，加上Jacbo的话有17只，从他们的高度和过大的爪子看来，很明显这些新加入的狼都非常非常年轻。我意识到其实早就该料到，有这么多吸血鬼出现在附近，浪人数量的急增是必然的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">More children dying. I wondered why Sam had allowed this, and then I realized he had no other choice. If any of the wolves stood with us, the Volturi would be sure to search out the rest. They had gambled their entire species on this stand.</div>

<div class="line_en">Abruptly, I was furious. Beyond furious, I was murderously enraged. My hopeless despair vanished entirely. A faint reddish glow highlighted the dark figures in front of me, and all I wanted in that moment was the chance to sink my teeth into them, to rip their limbs from their bodies and pile them for burning. I was so maddened I could have danced around the pyre where they roasted alive; I would have laughed while their ashes smoldered. My lips curved back automatically, and a low, fierce snarl tore up my throat from the pit of my stomach. I realized the corners of my mouth were turned up in a smile.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我突然变得狂躁起来，进而感受到一股几乎想大开杀戒的暴怒，之前的深切绝望顿时无影无踪。微弱的发红的光照亮了我前面那些黑影。我只想找个机会冲上去，把我的牙齿深深地插进他们的身体，撕扯下他们的胳膊，然后堆起这些尸体烧成灰烬。我如此的狂怒，我想要在他们活生生被炙烧的火堆旁翩翩起舞，在他们灰烬闷烧时放声大笑。我的嘴唇情不自禁的咧开，从身体最深处至喉咙发出了一声低沉而残暴的咆哮，我意识到我的嘴角展现出一个微笑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The bodies of the Volturi's witnesses leaned toward us, their eyes fixed furiously on Renesmee and me, but they stayed near the fringe of the forest, leaving a wide berth between themselves and the Volturi soldiers. Only Irina hovered close behind the Volturi, just a few paces away from the ancient females -- both fair-haired with powdery skin and filmed eyes -- and their two massive bodyguards.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="沃尔图里家族那些证人把身体倾向我们，眼睛愤怒的盯着我和蕾妮斯梅，但他们仍站在树林边缘，与沃尔图里的士兵们保持着宽阔的安全距离。只有伊琳娜紧紧地盘旋在沃尔图里家族后面，离那两个金发白皮肤，眼睛像有一层隔膜的年长女人和那两个魁梧的保镖只有几步远。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The shadowed Volturi faces were still expressionless for the most part. Only two sets of eyes betrayed any emotion at all. In the very center, touching hands, Aro and Caius had paused to evaluate, and the entire guard had paused with them, waiting for the order to kill. The two did not look at each other, but it was obvious that they were communicating. Marcus, though touching Aro's other hand, did not seem part of the conversation. His expression was not as mindless as the guards', but it was nearly as blank. Like the one other time I'd seen him, he appeared to be utterly bored.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="沃尔图里家族那些笼罩在阴影中的脸在很大程度上尽力保持着冷漠，只有两双眼睛是绝对的完全没有感情。在正中央处阿罗和Cauis手指轻碰，停在那里估测我们的能力。全体士兵都停下来等待大开杀戒的命令。他们俩虽然没有对视，但很明显他们在交谈。马库斯尽管触碰着阿罗的另一只手，但似乎并没有加入交谈，他的表情并不像士兵们那样无意识，但也近乎空虚，就像我以前见到的一样，他表现出十足的烦躁。">查看中文翻译</div>

Jane was edging forward like she couldn't help herself, and Renata's face was rigid with distress. For a moment, I examined this powerful shield that seemed so panicky and weak; though she was useful to Aro, I could tell she was no warrior. It was not her job to fight but to protect. There was no bloodlust in her. Raw as I was, I knew that if this were between her and me, I would obliterate her.</div>

<div class="line_en">"They seem quite attached to you, though," Aro said. "And your young mate and your… family. Loyal." His voice caressed the word softly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“但他们看上去与你非常亲近，”阿罗说，“甚至对你的伴侣和家人都是那么的，忠诚。”他轻轻地吐出了这个词。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"They don't belong to us, Aro. They don't follow our commands that way. They're here because they want to be."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他们不属于我们，阿罗。他们并不像你认为的那样服从我们的命令。他们之所以在这儿是出于他们自愿的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jacob's vast head turned in Edward's direction, and a faint whine slipped from between his teeth.</div>

<div class="line_en">There was one second of dead silence, and then the sound of the furious snarls ripping from the entire pack filled the giant clearing.</div>

<div class="line_en">Aro laughed merrily. "Just an errant thought," he repeated. "You well know how that is. We none of us can entirely control our subconscious desires."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿罗轻声笑了笑，“只是随便的一想，”他重复道，“你完全明白那是怎么回事，我们当中没人能完全控制自己潜意识的欲望。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was a sharp bark of command -- from Sam, I guessed, though I didn't turn to look -- and the complaint broke off into ominous quiet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一声命令口吻的急促咆哮——我猜是山姆发出的，虽然没回头看——使这些抱怨声戛然而止，陷入一种不祥的平静。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Edward hissed and leaned forward. I clutched at his arm, wondering what could be in Aro's thoughts that would make him react so violently, while Felix and Demetri slipped into crouches in synchronization. Aro waved them off again. They all returned to their former posture, Edward included.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱德华低吼着向前倾，我紧紧抓住他的胳膊，疑虑着到底阿罗怎样的想法会使爱德华反应如此愤怒。与此同时，费利克斯和德米特里一起摆出了伏击的姿势。阿罗又一次摆手阻止了他们。于是他们三人，包括爱德华，又全部恢复了之前的站姿。">查看中文翻译</div>
