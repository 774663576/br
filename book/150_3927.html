<div class="line_en">It was after dinner. As usual Walter sat by the lamp and read. He read every evening till Kitty went to bed and then went into a laboratory which he had fitted up in one of the bungalow's empty rooms. Here he worked late into the night. He slept little. He was occupied with she knew not what experiments. He told her nothing of his work; but even in the old days he had been reticent on this: he was not by nature expansive. She thought deeply of what he had just said to her: the conversation had led to nothing. She knew him so little that she could not be sure if he was speaking the truth or not. Was it possible that, whereas he now existed so ominously for her, she had entirely ceased to exist for him? Her conversation, which had entertained him once because he loved her, now that he loved her no longer might be merely tedious to him. It mortified her.</div>

<div class="line_en">She looked at him. The light of the lamp displayed his profile as though it were a cameo. With his regular and finely-cut features it was very distinguished, but it was more than severe, it was grim: that immobility of his, only his eyes moving as he perused each page, was vaguely terrifying. Who would have thought that this hard face could be melted by passion to such a tenderness of expression? She knew and it excited in her a little shiver of distaste. It was strange that though he was good-looking as well as honest, reliable, and talented, it had been so impossible for her to love him. It was a relief that she need never again submit to his caresses.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凯蒂向他看去。灯光之下他的侧影就像一座浮雕，端庄的五官极其醒目。他的神情可以说不是严峻，而几乎是残酷。除了眼睛随着书页左右转动，整个身体始终纹丝不动，看着让人胆战。谁会想到这张严酷的脸也会有柔情蜜意的时候呢？她想起他从前的样子，不禁徒生嫌恶。很奇怪，他面孔清秀，诚实可靠，才华出众，可她就是不爱他。如今他的亲吻、爱抚再也不会找上门来了，想想还真让人松了一口气。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Yes, he said he despised himself. What did he mean by that? Once again Kitty looked at his calm cool face. She might not even be in the room, he was so unconscious of her.</div>

<div class="line_en">He would not answer when she had asked him whether in forcing her to come here he had really wished to kill her. The mystery of this fascinated and horrified her. He was so extraordinarily kind; it was incredible that he could have had such a devilish intention. He must have suggested it only to frighten her and to get back on Charlie (that would be like his sardonic humour) and then from obstinacy or from fear of looking foolish insisted on her going through with it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她问他执意把她带过来是不是真想叫她死时，他反而闭口不答。那个令她惶惶不可终日的答案到底是什么呢？像他这样心地善良的人，绝不可能生出如此恶毒的主意。他的初衷应该只是想吓吓她，同时向查理报复（这符合他一贯的嘲讽做派），后来出于固执，或是保全面子才会一点也没松口，硬要她来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I think you do me an injustice," she said, "It's not fair to blame me because I was silly and frivolous and vulgar. I was brought up like that. All the girls I know are like that… It's like reproaching someone who has no ear for music because he's bored at a symphony concert. Is it fair to blame me because you ascribed to me qualities I hadn't got? I never tried to deceive you by pretending I was anything I wasn't. I was just pretty and gay. You don't ask for a pearl necklace or a sable coat at a booth in a fair; you ask for a tin trumpet and a toy balloon."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我觉得你对我有失公正。”她说道，“因为我愚蠢、轻佻、虚荣，你就责备我，这对我是不公平的。我就是被这样教养大的，我身边所有的女孩都是如此……你不能因为一个人不喜欢听交响音乐会，就责备他不会欣赏音乐。你不能强求我不具备的东西，否则对我就是不公平。我从来没欺骗过你，假装我会这会那。我有的仅仅是可爱漂亮，天性活泼。你不能指望到集市的货摊上买珍珠项链和貂皮大衣，你是去那儿买锡做的小号和玩具气球的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">His voice was weary. She was beginning to feel a trifle impatient with him. Why could he not realize, what suddenly had become so clear to her, that beside all the terror of death under whose shadow they lay and beside the awe of the beauty which she had caught a glimpse of that day, their own affairs were trivial? What did it really matter if a silly woman had committed adultery and why should her husband, face to face with the sublime, give it a thought? It was strange that Walter with all his cleverness should have so little sense of proportion. Because he had dressed a doll in gorgeous robes and set her in a sanctuary to worship her, and then discovered that the doll was filled with sawdust he could neither forgive himself nor her. His soul was lacerated. It was all make-believe that he had lived on, and when the truth shattered it he thought reality itself was shattered. It was true enough, he would not forgive her because he could not forgive himself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的声音有气无力，她甚至生出些火气来了。为什么他就不能明白呢？她已经一目了然了。和笼罩在心头的对死亡的恐惧相比，和那天她偶见的神圣的自然之美相比，他们之间的事儿不是过于渺小琐屑了吗？一个愚蠢的女人红杏出墙又能怎么样？为什么她的丈夫就不能轻描淡写，过去就让它过去了呢？瓦尔特枉为聪明一世，到了这会儿孰轻孰重也分不清。他当初是情人眼里出西施，把她当成无价之宝供奉起来，后来发现她其实是金玉其外，就再也不肯原谅自己，也不原谅她。他的灵魂已经裂成两半儿了，他苟活到现在纯粹是一派假象。当真相豁然摆在眼前的时候，他的生活其实就已经完了。明摆着的事，他不会原谅她，因为他根本不能原谅他自己。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She thought that she heard him give a faint sigh and she shot a rapid glance at him. A sudden thought struck her and it took her breath away. She only just refrained from giving a cry.</div>
