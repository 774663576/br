<div class="line_en">"I love you, Mom. See you tomorrow." I said these words every day as I kissed my mom goodbye. Most girls I know don't tell their mothers they love them when they say goodbye. But I wasn't like girls I knew.</div>

<div class="line_en">As a baby, I was adopted by two loving people who were willing to take me into their home. They became not only my parents, but also my best friends. As I was growing up, I learned that my birth mother was very young when she had me and wasn't able to care for me. I understood and was thankful. After all, I ended up with two people who loved each other very much, and also loved me. Three years later, they adopted another baby, Lori.</div>

<div class="line_en">Until I was nine, I didn't understand why my parents didn't have any children of their own. Then my father explained that they had tried many times, but they were unsuccessful. Part of the reason was that my mom had diabetes. Since I was young, I didn't really understand what that meant. As I was growing up, I would see my mom give herself shots and wonder why she was the only one who had to do that. All I saw every day was a strong, beautiful, healthy woman, who spent her life helping people.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="直到9岁，我才明白为什么我的父母没要一个他们自己的孩子。那时，爸爸解释说，他们尝试过很多次，但是都没有成功。部分原因是妈妈患有糖尿病。那时我还年幼，不能真正理解那意味着什么。我渐渐长大，看到妈妈为自己打针，我不明白为什么只有她一个人这样做。我每天看到的都是一个坚强、美丽、健康的女人，一生都在帮助别人的女人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It started with a tiny blister on my mom's toe. This may seem like no big deal, but she ended up losing her toe. Soon she suffered a stroke, and just as she began to recover from that, her leg had to be amputated.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="首先是从妈妈脚趾上的一个小水疱开始的。这看上去似乎没什么大不了，但是她差一点就失去了一个脚趾。不久之后，妈妈又患了中风，而就在她刚开始恢复的时候，又不得不接受一条腿的截肢手术。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This all took place over three years. The toll this took on my family was unbelievable. My mom was in and out of five hospitals, each doing their best to help her. Sometimes she was home for a few months, but something always seemed to go wrong. When the holidays came, my father, my sister and I spent the day in her hospital room. One Thanksgiving we ate turkey there, and another Christmas we brought all our presents to the hospital so she could see us open them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这一切仅仅在三年之内全部发生。我们家为此付出的代价简直让人难以置信。妈妈在五家医院进进出出，每家医院都竭尽所能帮助她。有时妈妈在家里住上几个月，但是这期间总会有一些不妙的事情发生。假日里，爸爸、妹妹和我就在病房里陪她。有一年感恩节，我们还在医院里一起吃火鸡；还有一年圣诞节，我们把所有的礼物都带到医院，让她看着我们把礼物打开。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I tried my hardest to make her feel better, but nothing helped. At home, taking care of my little sister became my job, along with cleaning the house, doing the laundry and cooking the meals. I thought it was unfair, and took it out on my father. I hated the fact that all my friends went out on Friday nights, while I had to stay home and play "Mommy".</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我想尽办法想要使她感觉快乐一点，但是一切都是徒劳。在家里，照看小妹妹成了我的工作，同时我还要打扫房间、洗衣服、做饭。我觉得这对我不公平，便发泄在爸爸身上。我所有的朋友都能在周五晚上出去玩，而我却不得不待在家里，充当“妈妈”的角色，我讨厌这个事实。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But once again, the happy days became sad. On June 15, I stayed home from school to take care of her. Once again she was admitted to the hospital. At first, no one could figure out what was wrong. She remained in intensive care for a week. She began to do better. Then on July 10 she became very sick, and on the eleventh she almost died.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，快乐的日子再一次变成了悲伤。6月15日，我没去上学，而是留在家里照顾她。她再一次被送进医院。刚一开始，没人能发现她出现了什么问题。妈妈在加护病房里一连待了一星期。后来她开始好起来，但是7月10日，她的病情又加重了，到11日时，她已徘徊在生死线上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was even harder for me to go to school while my mom was lying in the hospital. By now, I was sixteen. Luckily she was there for my birthday party, and I'll never forget hugging her as tears fell down both our faces. I'm still thankful for that moment with my mother because it was the happiest I had seen her in four years.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="更困难的是，妈妈躺在医院的病床上，我还要去上学。我现在只有16岁。幸运的是，妈妈出席了我的生日聚会，我永远也不会忘记，当我拥抱她的时候，我们母女泪流满面的情景。我至今都对与妈妈在一起的那一刻充满感激，因为那是四年来，我所见到的妈妈最快乐的时刻。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was getting harder and harder to deal with. Every time she got really sick, she would always come back and do even better.</div>

<div class="line_en">When the doctors finally realized why she was so sick, they put her on dialysis, a treatment for her kidneys. It seemed to work on August 17, we visited her and she was doing extremely well. When I left, I kissed her and said, "I love you, Mom. See you tomorrow."</div>
