<div class="line_en">Assessing the populace, checking up on it, is a principal and never-ending social activity in Communist countries. If a painter is to have an exhibition, an ordinary citizen to receive a visa to a country with a sea coast, a soccer player to join the national team, then a vast array of recommendations and reports must be garnered (from the concierge, colleagues, the police, the local Party organization, the pertinent trade union) and added up, weighed, and summarized by special officials. These reports have nothing to do with artistic talent, kicking ability, or maladies that respond well to salt sea air; they deal with one thing only: the citizen's political profile (in other words, what the citizen says, what he thinks, how he behaves, how he acquits himself at meetings or May Day parades). Because everything (day-to-day existence, promotion at work, vacations) depends on the outcome of the assessment process, everyone (whether he wants to play soccer for the national team, have an exhibition, or spend his holidays at the seaside) must behave in such a way as to deserve a favorable assessment.</div>

<div class="line_en">That was not the thing to say. A man with artificially waved gray hair pointed a long index finger at her. That's no way to talk. You're all responsible for what happened. You, too. How did you oppose the Communist regime? All you did was paint pictures…</div>

<div class="line_en">Because she was a painter, she had an eye for detail and a memory for the physical characteristics of the people in Prague who had a passion for assessing others. All of them had index fingers slightly longer than their middle fingers and pointed them at whomever they happened to be talking to. In fact, President Novotny, who had ruled the country for the fourteen years preceding 1968, sported the very same barber-induced gray waves and had the longest index finger of all the inhabitants of Central Europe.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="身为画家，她精于观察人的脸部。自从到了布拉格，对热衷于监察及评判他人的那类人的长相，她已经相当熟悉。这类人全都长着比中指稍长的食指，说话时专用来指戳对方。而且，曾在波希米亚连续执政十四年直至一九六八年的诺沃提尼总统，也有着一头一模一样的让理发师用发钳烫过的花白鬈发，还为自己拥有中欧居民中最长的食指而洋洋自得。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When the distinguished emigre heard from the lips of a painter whose pictures he had never seen that he resembled Communist President Novotny, he turned scarlet, then white, then scarlet again, then white once more; he tried to say something, did not succeed, and fell silent. Everyone else kept silent until Sabina stood up and left.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那位尊贵的移民未曾见过这位女画家的一幅作品，当他从她的嘴里听出他长得很像共产党人诺沃提尼总统时，脸顿时涨红了，接着发白，一阵红，又一阵白，想辩驳什么，却说不出来，陷入了沉默。所有的人同他一道哑口无言。萨比娜最终只得起身。离开了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That was what ran through Sabina's mind as she listened to the gray-haired man speak. He didn't care whether his fellow-countrymen were good kickers or painters (none of the Czechs at the emigre gathering ever showed any interest in what Sabina painted); he cared whether they had opposed Communism actively or just passively, really and truly or just for appearances' sake, from the very beginning or just since emigration.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="萨比娜听那位灰白头发的先生讲话时想的就是这些。同胞足球踢得好不好，或是有无绘画才华（从来没有一个捷克人关心过她画的什么），这人都满不在乎；他只对一件事情感兴趣：弄清楚他们是否反对过当局，是积极地还是消极地，是一开始就背叛还是最终变节，是真正反对还是装装样子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She was walking fast. She was more disturbed by her own thoughts than by her break with the emigres. She knew she was being unfair. There were other Czechs, after all, people quite different from the man with the long index finger. The embarrassed silence that followed her little speech did not by any means indicate they were all against her. No, they were probably bewildered by the sudden hatred, the lack of understanding they were all subjected to in emigration. Then why wasn't she sorry for them? Why didn't she see them for the woeful and abandoned creatures they were?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她急匆匆地走着，困扰她的，不是因为与那些移民闹翻了，而是因为自己的这些念头。她知道这些想法不公正。捷克人中除了那类食指过长的，还有另一些人。她说话之后那难堪的沉默丝毫不意味着所有人都是反对她的。他们是因为突如其来的敌意，因为她不理解他们做移民的苦衷而不知如何是好。那么，她为什么不对他们抱以同情？为何不觉得他们是被抛弃的，让人可怜的呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Or great men? Jan Hus? None of the people in that room had ever read a line of his works. The only thing they were all able to understand was the flames, the glory of the flames when he was burned at the stake, the glory of the ashes, so for them the essence of being Czech came down to ashes and nothing more. The only things that held them together were their defeats and the reproaches they addressed to one another.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="抑或是那些伟人？扬·胡斯？他的著作那帮人连一行字也没有读过。他们惟一毫无例外都能明白的，就是火焰，胡斯被当作异端烧死时那火焰的荣光，化为灰烬的荣光。如此一来，萨比娜心想，捷克之魂的精髓对于他们来说，就是一抔灰烬罢了。这些人的共同之处，不过是他们的失败和相互的斥责。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then suddenly the intoxication gave way to anguish: The road had to end somewhere! Sooner or later she would have to put an end to her betrayals! Sooner or later she would have to stop herself!</div>

<div class="line_en">We know why. After she betrayed her father, life opened up before her, a long road of betrayals, each one attracting her as vice and victory. She would not keep ranks! She refused to keep ranks -- always with the same people, with the same speeches! That was why she was so stirred by her own injustice. But it was not an unpleasant feeling; quite the contrary, Sabina had the impression she had just scored a victory and someone invisible was applauding her for it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们已知道答案：当初背叛父亲，她脚下展开的人生就如同一条漫长的背叛之路，每一次新的背叛，既像一桩罪恶又似一场胜利，时刻在诱惑着她。她不愿固定在自己的位置上，决不！她决不愿一辈子跟同一些人为伍，重复着相同的话，死守着同一个位置！这就是为什么她反而为自己的不公正而兴奋。过分的激烈并没有让她不舒服。相反，萨比娜觉得自己刚刚获得了一次胜利，仿佛某个看不见的人在为她鼓掌叫好。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was evening and she was hurrying through the railway station. The train to Amsterdam was in. She found her coach. Guided by a friendly guard, she opened the door to her compartment and found Franz sitting on a couchette. He rose to greet her; she threw her arms around him and smothered him with kisses.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当天晚上，她脚步匆匆地赶到车站月台。去阿姆斯特丹的列车已经就位，她找寻着自己的车厢。一位很和气的乘务员将她领到了卧铺车室的门口，她一拉开门，发现弗兰茨坐在床上，床上的盖毯已经拉开。他急忙起身来迎，她一把将他拥入怀中，亲了又亲。">查看中文翻译</div>
