<div class="line_en">He ordered a bottle of wine. I have to drive home, said Tomas by way of refusal. I'll lose my license if they find I've been drinking. The man from the Ministry of the Interior smiled. If anything happens, just show them this. And he handed Tomas a card engraved with his name (though clearly not his real name) and the telephone number of the Ministry.</div>

<div class="line_en">One day, at the end of office hours, he was visited by a man of about fifty whose portliness added to his dignity. He introduced himself as representing the Ministry of the Interior, and invited Tomas to join him for a drink across the street.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一天，门诊结束后，他接待了一位五十岁左右男人的来访，此人体态肥胖，一副一本正经的样子，他自我介绍，说是国家内务部某办公室主任，请托马斯到对面咖啡馆里坐一坐。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">First he went to work in a country clinic about fifty miles from Prague. He commuted daily by train and came home exhausted. A year later, he managed to find a more advantageous but much inferior position at a clinic on the outskirts of Prague. There, he could no longer practice surgery, and became a general practitioner. The waiting room was jammed, and he had scarcely five minutes for each patient; he told them how much aspirin to take, signed their sick-leave documents, and referred them to specialists. He considered himself more civil servant than doctor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="托马斯先是在布拉格八十公里外的一家乡村诊所找了份工作。每天乘火车来回赶，下班回到家，都快累瘫了。一年以后，他好不容易又在郊区一家诊所找到了个差使，虽说省了点劲，但位置很低。他再不能专攻外科，只能做点普通内科大夫的事。候诊室里总是挤满了人，三五分钟，就得处理一个病人，给他们开点阿司匹林，开张病假条，再不就是打发他们去专业诊所。在他看来，自己简直已经成了办公室的小职员，再也不是什么医生。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Since no one had thought to praise Tomas in quite some time, he listened to the plump official very carefully, and he was surprised by the precision and detail of the man's knowledge of his professional career. How defenseless we are in the face of flattery! Tomas was unable to prevent himself from taking seriously what the Ministry official said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="托马斯已经很久没有听到有人这样夸他了，于是非常专心地听着这位大腹便便的矮个子说话，很吃惊地发现矮个子对他外科方面的成就了如指掌，连细节都清清楚楚。面对奉承，谁也挡不住！托马斯也一样，禁不住把内务部的人所说的也当真了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He then went into a long speech about how much he admired Tomas and how the whole Ministry was distressed at the thought of so respected a surgeon dispensing aspirin at an outlying clinic. He gave Tomas to understand that although he couldn't come out and say it, the police did not agree with drastic tactics like removing specialists from their posts.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着，他开始向托马斯细加解释说他一直非常敬重他，说像托马斯这样一位能干的外科大夫却委屈在乡下诊所开阿司匹林，部里的人都感到惋惜。他甚至，尽管没敢大声说出来，委婉地向托马斯暗示，把一些专家无情地从他们的职位上赶走，连警察部门也表示遗憾。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But it was not out of mere vanity. More important was Tomas's lack of experience. When you sit face to face with someone who is pleasant, respectful, and polite, you have a hard time reminding yourself that nothing he says is true, that nothing is sincere. Maintaining nonbelief (constantly, systematically, without the slightest vacillation) requires a tremendous effort and the proper training -- in other words, frequent police interrogations. Tomas lacked that training.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当然这并不仅仅是出于虚荣心，而是因为他太没经验。面对一位友善、礼貌又对自己十分恭敬的人，很难时刻提醒自己对方的话没有一句是真的，没有一句是诚的。要想做到不去相信（而且是持续地、执拗地、毫不犹豫地），不仅要作巨大的努力，还得经过特别训练，比如经常接受警察审讯什么的。但托马斯正缺这样的训练。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="内务部的人接着说：“大夫，我们都知道，您在苏黎世情况很好，但您回国来，我们非常欣赏，您这可是做对了，因为您知道您的位置是在这里。”然后他又好像责怪托马斯似的说了句：“可是您的位置应该是在手术室啊！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“一个记者。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It is a tragicomic fact that our proper upbringing has become an ally of the secret police. We do not know how to lie. The Tell the truth! imperative drummed into us by our mamas and papas functions so automatically that we feel ashamed of lying even to a secret policeman during an interrogation. It is simpler for us to argue with him or insult him (which makes no sense whatever) than to lie to his face (which is the only thing to do).</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="滑稽又可悲的是，在这种时候我们所接受过的良好教育恰恰成了警察的帮凶。因为我们不懂得怎么扯谎。从小爸爸妈妈就喝令我们“说实话”，结果弄得我们一撒谎就自觉耻辱，即使是在审问我们的警察面前也一样。跟警察吵甚至当面骂（虽然这毫无意义）倒比撒谎（而这才是惟一该做的）要容易得多。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Not until that point did Tomas realize that he was under interrogation. All at once he saw that his every word could put someone in danger. Although he obviously knew the name of the editor in question, he denied it: I'm not sure.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“那么他让您去做什么呢？你们谈了些什么？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It sounded like a ridiculous attempt at evasion. And again the man from the Ministry waxed indignant at Tomas's refusal to tell the truth: First you tell me they cut your text by a third, then you tell me they talked to you about word order! Is that logical?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这样的回答着实让人觉得是个可笑的遁词。内务部的人又再一次对托马斯不肯说真话而表示不满：“您看，大夫！您刚跟我说过他们把您的文章砍去了三分之一，现在又说他们要您去只是探讨句子结构！这总不符合逻辑吧！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Aha, said the man from the Ministry, and a big chin!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是吗？”内务部的人说，“是不是长着又长又尖的下巴？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That's right, said Tomas again, realizing that now the man from the Ministry had pinpointed an individual. Not only had Tomas informed on some poor editor but, more important, the information he had given was false.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“对。”托马斯重复道。他开始明白内务部的人已经确定了某个人。这下托马斯不仅出卖了另一个倒霉的记者，而且他的揭发还是个纯粹的谎言。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">What did he look like?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那他长什么样子？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tomas tried to choose diametrically opposed characteristics: He was tall, he said, and had long black hair.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="托马斯于是就专挑相反的特征描述：“他个子挺高，黑头发，很长。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When the man from the Ministry accused him of insincerity, Tomas nearly felt guilty; he had to surmount a moral barrier to be able to persevere in his lie: I suppose he did introduce himself, he said, but because his name didn't ring a bell, I immediately forgot it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="听到内务部的人责备自己没有诚意，托马斯几乎感到是个罪过；他好不容易克服了某种道德障碍，才得以继续往下乱说：“他恐怕作过自我介绍，但是那个名字没有什么特别的，我听过就忘掉了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="这下，托马斯回答就容易多了，因为他所说的完全是实话。“是不合逻辑，但事情就是这样的，”他笑着回答说，“他们问我是否允许他们把一句话的结构改一改，但是后来他们砍了文章的三分之一。”">查看中文翻译</div>
