<div class="line_en">Harry could smell salt and hear rushing waves; a light, chilly breeze ruffled his hair as he looked out at moon-lit sea and star-strewn sky. He was standing upon a high outcrop of dark rock, water foaming and churning below him. He glanced over his shoulder. A towering cliff stood behind them, a sheer drop, black and faceless. A few large chunks of rock, such as the one upon which Harry and Dumbledore were standing, looked as though they had broken away from the cliff face at some point in the past. It was a bleak, harsh view, the sea and the rock unrelieved by any tree or sweep of grass or sand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利可以闻到大海的气味，听见波涛汹涌的声音。他望着远处月光下的大海和繁星点点的夜空，一阵寒冷的微风吹拂着他的头发。他站在一块露出海面的高高的黑色岩石上，海浪在他脚下翻滚，泛起泡沫。他扭头朝后望去。身后耸立着一座悬崖，陡峭的岩壁直落而下，黑糊糊的看不清面目。几块很大的岩石，如哈利和邓布利多站着的这块，似乎是过去某个时候从悬崖的正面脱落下来的。四下里光秃秃的，满目荒凉，除了苍茫的大海和岩石，看不见一棵树，也没有草地和沙滩。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Not here, precisely," said Dumbledore. "There is a village of sorts about halfway along the cliffs behind us. I believe the orphans were taken there for a little sea air and a view of the waves. No, I think it was only ever Tom Riddle and his youthful victims who visited this spot. No Muggle could reach this rock unless they were uncommonly good mountaineers, and boats cannot approach the cliffs, the waters around them are too dangerous. I imagine that Riddle climbed down; magic would have served better than ropes. And he brought two small children with him, probably for the pleasure of terrorizing them. I think the journey alone would have done it, don't you?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“确切地说，不是这儿。”邓布利多说，“在我们后面那些悬崖的半腰上，有一个勉强称得上村庄的地方。我相信他们把孤儿们带到了那儿，让他们呼吸呼吸大海的空气，看看海浪。不，我认为只有汤姆·里德尔和那几个被他欺负的孩子曾经到过这个地方。麻瓜不可能爬上这块大岩石，除非他们特别擅长攀岩；船也没法靠近悬崖，周围的水域太危险了。我可以想象里德尔是怎么爬上来的，魔法肯定比绳索更管用。他还带了两个小孩子，大概是为了享受恐吓他们的乐趣吧。我想其实他一个人上来就行了，你说呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No," said Harry.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没关系。”哈利说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You see?" said Dumbledore quietly, holding his wand a little higher. Harry saw a fissure in the cliff into which dark water was swirling.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“看见了吗？”邓布利多轻声问，一边把魔杖举得更高一些。哈利看见悬崖上有一道裂缝，黑黢黢的海水在里面打着旋儿。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dumbledore beckoned Harry to the very edge of the rock where a series of jagged niches made footholds leading down to boulders that lay half-submerged in water and closer to the cliff. It was a treacherous descent and Dumbledore, hampered slightly by his withered hand, moved slowly. The lower rocks were slippery with seawater. Harry could feel flecks of cold salt spray hitting his face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="邓布利多示意哈利走到岩石边缘，岩石上许多可供踩脚的参差不齐的凹缝，通向下面那些在悬崖周围、半露出海面的巨型卵石。从这里攀岩而下非常危险，邓布利多那只焦枯的手不听使唤，行动比较迟缓。低处的岩石被海水冲刷得溜溜溜的。哈利感觉到散发着海腥味儿的冰冷水花溅在他脸上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Lumos," said Dumbledore, as he reached the boulder closest to the cliff face. A thousand flecks of golden light sparkled upon the dark surface of the water a few feet below where he crouched; the black wall of rock beside him was illuminated too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“荧光闪烁！”邓布利多下到最靠近悬崖正面的那块巨型卵石上，蹲下身念了句咒语。星星点点的金光在他身下几英尺处的黝黑海面上闪烁着。他身边那道漆黑的岩壁也被照亮了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Then take off your Invisibility Cloak -- there is no need for it now -- and let us take the plunge," And with the sudden agility of a much younger man, Dumbledore slid from the boulder, landed in the sea, and began to swim, with a perfect breaststroke, toward the dark slit in the rock face, his lit wand held in his teeth. Harry pulled off his cloak, stuffed it into his pocket, and followed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那就把你的隐形衣脱掉——现在没必要穿着它了——然后让我们冒险试一试吧。”邓布利多突然变得像年轻人一样身手敏捷，他从那块卵石上轻轻地滑进海水里，朝岩石表面那道漆黑的裂缝游去。他把魔杖叼在嘴里，采用的是完美的蛙泳姿势。哈利脱下隐形衣塞进口袋，也跟了上去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The water was icy; Harry's waterlogged clothes billowed around him and weighed him down. Taking deep breaths that filled his nostrils with the tang of salt and seaweed, he struck out for the shimmering, shrinking light now moving deeper into the cliff.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="海水冷极了。哈利的衣服被水浸透之后，变得胀鼓鼓沉甸甸的，拽着他直往下沉。他深深吸了几口气，闻到刺鼻的盐腥味儿和海藻味儿，他挣扎着寻找那道正往悬崖深处移动、变得越来越小的闪烁的亮光。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The fissure soon opened into a dark tunnel that Harry could tell would be filled with water at high tide. The slimy walls were barely three feet apart and glimmered like wet tar in the passing light of Dumbledore's wand. A little way in, the passageway curved to the left, and Harry saw that it extended far into the cliff. He continued to swim in Dumbledore's wake, the tips of his benumbed fingers brushing the rough, wet rock.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="很快，裂缝变成了一条漆黑的暗道，哈利看得出来，涨潮的时候暗道肯定会被海水灌满。两边沾满黏泥的岩壁只间隔三英尺宽，在邓布利多魔杖一闪而过亮光照耀下，像柏油一样闪着湿漉漉的光。再往里去一点，暗道向左一拐，哈利看见它一直伸向悬崖的最深处。他继续跟着邓布利多往前游，冻得麻木的手指在粗糙、潮湿的岩石上擦过。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then he saw Dumbledore rising out of the water ahead, his silver hair and dark robes gleaming. When Harry reached the spot he found steps that led into a large cave. He clambered up them, water streaming from his soaking clothes, and emerged, shivering uncontrollably, into the still and freezing air.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后，他看见前面的邓布利多从水里站了起来，银白色的头发和黑色长袍都闪烁着水光。哈利游到那里，发现有台阶通向一个很大的岩洞。他费力地登上台阶，水从湿透的衣服里哗哗往下直流。他终于走出了海水，周围的空气寂静而寒冷，他控制不住地瑟瑟发抖。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dumbledore was standing in the middle of the cave, his wand held high as he turned slowly on the spot, examining the walls and ceiling.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="邓布利多已经站在了岩洞中央，魔杖高高地举在手里，他原地缓缓地转着圈，仔细查看着岩壁和洞顶。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes, this is the place," said Dumbledore.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没错，就是这个地方。”邓布利多说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"How can you tell?" Harry spoke in a whisper.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你怎么知道的？”哈利小声问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It has known magic," said Dumbledore simply.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“它见识过魔法。”邓布利多简短地说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dumbledore approached the wall of the cave and caressed it with his blackened fingertips, murmuring words in a strange tongue that Harry did not understand. Twice Dumbledore walked right around the cave, touching as much of the rough rock as he could, occasionally pausing, running his fingers backward and for-ward over a particular spot, until finally he stopped, his hand pressed flat against the wall.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="邓布利多走近洞壁，用焦黑的指尖抚摸着它，又用一种奇怪的、哈利听不懂的语言轻声说着什么。邓布利多从左边绕着岩洞走了两圈，边走边尽可能地触摸粗糙的洞壁，偶尔停下来用手指在某个地方上上下下地摸索一番。最后，他终于停住脚步，把手掌平按在洞壁上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Here," he said. "We go on through here. The entrance is concealed."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这儿，”他说，“我们从这儿进去。入口是隐蔽的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry could not tell whether the shivers he was experiencing were due to his spine-deep coldness or to the same awareness of enchantments. He watched as Dumbledore continued to revolve on the spot, evidently concentrating on things Harry could not see. "This is merely the antechamber, the entrance hall," said Dumbledore after a moment or two. "We need to penetrate the inner place… Now it is Lord Voldemort's obstacles that stand in our way, rather than those nature made…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利不知道他这样浑身发抖，是因为寒冷侵入了骨髓呢，还是因为他也意识到了魔咒的存在。他注视着邓布利多继续在原地慢慢地旋转，显然是在专注地研究某些哈利看不见的东西。“这只是前厅，是入口大厅，”邓布利多过了片刻说道，“我们需要进到里面去……现在挡住我们的是伏地魔布下的机关，而不是大自然设置的障碍……”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry did not ask how Dumbledore knew. He had never seen a wizard work things out like this, simply by looking and touching; but Harry had long since learned that bangs and smoke were more often the marks of ineptitude than expertise.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利没有问邓布利多是怎么知道的。他从没见过哪个巫师这样解决难题：只用眼睛看，用手摸。不过哈利早就知道，弄得乒乒乓乓、烟雾大作的，通常是水平较低的人的特点，而不是高手的做派。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dumbledore stepped back from the cave wall and pointed his wand at the rock. For a moment, an arched outline appeared there, blazing white as though there was a powerful light behind the crack.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="邓布利多从洞壁前往后退了几步，用魔杖指向岩石。顿时，那里出现了一道拱门的轮廓，放射出耀眼的白光，似乎裂缝后面有强烈的灯光照着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Harry, I'm so sorry, I forgot," he said; he now pointed his wand at Harry and at once, Harry's clothes were as warm and dry as if they had been hanging in front of a blazing fire.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哈利，真对不起，我忘记了。”他说，他用魔杖一指哈利，哈利的衣服立刻变得干爽、暖和了，就像挂在熊熊的炉火前烘过一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You've done it!" said Harry through chattering teeth, but before the words had left his lips the outline had gone, leaving the rock as bare and solid as ever. Dumbledore looked around.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你成——成功了！”哈利说，他的牙齿在嘚嘚地打着战，但他的话音未落，那道轮廓就不见了，岩石还跟刚才一样坚硬厚实，上面什么也没有。邓布利多扭头看了看。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Thank you," said Harry gratefully, but Dumbledore had already turned his attention back to the solid cave wall. He did not try any more magic, but simply stood there staring at it intently, as though something extremely interesting was written on it. Harry stayed quite still; he did not want to break Dumbledores concentration.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“谢谢。”哈利感激地说，可是邓布利多已经又把注意力转向了坚实的洞壁。他没有再尝试别的魔法，只是站在那里，全神贯注地盯着洞壁，似乎那上面写着什么极为有趣的东西。哈利一动不动地站在那儿，他不想打断邓布利多的思路。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“是啊，但如果能够避免……”哈利说，他遭受过的痛苦太多了，不愿意再经历更多。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I rather think," said Dumbledore, putting his uninjured hand inside his robes and drawing out a short silver knife of the kind Harry used to chop potion ingredients, "that we are required to make payment to pass."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我认为，”邓布利多说着用那只没有受伤的手从长袍里掏出一把银质的短刀，就是哈利用来切魔药配料的那种，“我们需要付出代价才能通过。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Sometimes, however, it is unavoidable," said Dumbledore, shaking back the sleeve of his robes and exposing the forearm of his injured hand.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I said it was crude," said Dumbledore, who sounded disdainful, even disappointed, as though Voldemort had fallen short of higher standards Dumbledore expected. "The idea, as I am sure you will have gathered, is that your enemy must weaken him or herself to enter. Once again, Lord Voldemort fails to grasp that there are much more terrible things than physical injury."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“所以我说太低级了。”邓布利多说，他的口气里透着轻蔑，甚至失望，似乎伏地魔没能达到邓布利多预期的标准，“我相信你也明白，其道理是想让对手削弱自己方能进入。伏地魔又一次没能理解，有许多东西比肉体的伤害可怕得多。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他不知道自己要说什么——更年轻，更结实？然而邓布利多只是微微笑了笑。一道银光闪过，喷出一股殷红，岩石表面顿时洒满了闪亮的、暗红色的血珠。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You are very kind, Harry," said Dumbledore, now passing the tip of his wand over the deep cut he had made in his own arm, so that it healed instantly, just as Snape had healed Malfoy's wound, "But your blood is worth more than mine. Ah, that seems to have done the trick, doesn't it?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你很善良，哈利。”邓布利多说，他用魔杖尖划过他在自己手臂上割开的那道深深的伤口，伤口立刻就愈合了，就像斯内普给马尔福疗伤的情景一样，“可是你的血比我的更有价值。啊，看来真的有效，是不是？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Professor!" protested Harry, hurrying forward as Dumbledore raised his knife. "I'll do it, I'm --" He did not know what he was going to say -- younger, fitter?</div>

<div class="line_en">The blazing silver outline of an arch had appeared in the wall once more, and this time it did not fade away: The blood-spattered rock within it simply vanished, leaving an opening into what seemed total darkness.</div>

<div class="line_en">An eerie sight met their eyes: They were standing on the edge of a great black lake, so vast that Harry could not make out the distant banks, in a cavern so high that the ceiling too was out of sight. A misty greenish light shone far away in what looked like the middle of the lake; it was reflected in the completely still water below. The greenish glow and the light from the two wands were the only things that broke the otherwise velvety blackness, though their rays did not penetrate as far as Harry would have expected. The darkness was somehow denser than normal darkness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们眼前是一副十分怪异的景象。他们站在一片黑色的大湖岸边，湖面无比宽阔，一望无际，哈利看不见远处的对岸。他们所处的山洞很高，抬头望去也看不见洞顶。远远的，像是在湖的中央，闪烁着一道朦胧的、绿莹莹的光，倒映在下面死寂的湖水中。除了那道绿光和两根魔杖发出的亮光，四下里完全是浓得化不开的黑暗，而这几道亮光的穿透性也不像哈利预想的那么强，这里的黑暗似乎比普通的更稠密，更厚重。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He set off around the edge of the lake, and Harry followed close behind him. Their footsteps made echoing, slapping sounds on the narrow rim of rock that surrounded the water. On and on they walked, but the view did not vary: on one side of them, the rough cavern wall, on the other, the boundless expanse of smooth, glassy blackness, in the very middle of which was that mysterious greenish glow. Harry found the place and the silence oppressive, unnerving.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他绕着湖岸往前走，哈利紧跟在他后面。他们的脚步踏在湖边狭窄的岩石上，发出啪啪的回声。他们一直往前走，可是四周的景象没有丝毫改变：一边是粗糙的岩洞壁，另一边是无边无际、光滑如镜的黑色湖面，湖的正中央闪烁着那道神秘的绿光。哈利感觉这个地方以及这种寂静令人压抑，心神不安。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Immediately a thick coppery green chain appeared out of thin air, extending from the depths of the water into Dumbledore's clenched hand.

<div class="line_en">Dumbledore stood aside and Harry climbed carefully into the boat. Dumbledore stepped in too, coiling the chain onto the floor. They were crammed in together; Harry could not comfortably sit, but crouched, his knees jutting over the edge of the boat, which began to move at once. There was no sound other than the silken rustle of the boat's prow cleaving the water; it moved without their help, as though an invisible rope was pulling it onward toward the light in the center. Soon they could no longer see the walls of the cavern; they might have been at sea except that there were no waves.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Sir -- here!" Harry yelled, and lunging forward, he tipped the water clumsily over Dumbledores face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“先生——给！”哈利喊道，他向前一扑，笨手笨脚地把水倒在了邓布利多的脸上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was the best he could do, for the icy feeling on his arm not holding the cup was not the lingering chill of the water. A slimy white hand had gripped his wrist, and the creature to whom it belonged was pulling him, slowly, backward across the rock. The surface of the lake was no longer mirror-smooth; it was churning, and everywhere Harry looked, white heads and hands were emerging from the dark water, men and women and children with sunken, sightless eyes were moving toward the rock: an army of the dead rising from the black water.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他只能做到这样了，因为，他那没拿杯子的胳膊上有一种冷飕飕的感觉，但并不是因为有冰冷的湖水溅在上面。一只黏糊糊、白森森的手抓住了他的手腕，那个家伙正在慢慢地把他往岩石后面拖。湖面不再光滑如镜，而是在剧烈地搅动。哈利望去，到处都是白森森的脑袋和手从黑糊糊的水里冒出来，男人的，女人的，孩子的，都睁着凹陷的、没有视觉的眼睛，朝岩石这边漂浮过来：漆黑的湖水里浮现出一大片死尸。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Petrificus Totalus!" yelled Harry, struggling to cling to the smooth, soaked surface of the island as he pointed his wand at the Inferius that had his arm. It released him, falling backward into the water with a splash; he scrambled to his feet, but many more Inferi were already climbing onto the rock, their bony hands clawing at its slippery surface, their blank, frosted eyes upon him, trailing waterlogged rags, sunken faces leering.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“统统石化！”哈利大喊，他一边拼命抓住岛上光滑潮湿的岩石表面，一边用魔杖指着那个抓住他胳膊的阴尸。阴尸松开了他，扑通一声跌回到水里。哈利挣扎着站起来。可是更多的阴尸已经爬上了岩石，它们枯槁的手抓住溜滑滑的岩石，空洞洞、雾蒙蒙的眼睛盯着他，被水浸湿的破衣烂衫拖在身后，一张张凹陷的脸上带着鄙夷的神情。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A few of them stumbled, one or two of them bound in ropes, but those climbing onto the rock behind them merely stepped over or on the fallen bodies. Still slashing at the air with his wand, Harry yelled, "Sectumsempra! SECTUMSEMPRA!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="几具阴尸踉跄着摔倒了，其中一两个被绳子捆了起来，然而，在它们后面爬上岩石的那些阴尸只是跨过它们，或踩着它们倒下的身体又走了过来。哈利继续使劲挥舞着魔杖，大声喊道：“神锋无影！神锋无影！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Petrificus Totalus!" Harry bellowed again, backing away as he swiped his wand through the air; six or seven of them crumpled, but more were coming toward him. "Impedimenta! Incarcerous!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“统统石化！”哈利又大喊了一声，他一边后退一边使劲在空中挥舞着魔杖。六七具阴尸被击倒了，但是更多的阴尸朝他逼来。“障碍重重！速速禁锢！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But then, through the darkness, fire erupted: crimson and gold, a ring of fire that surrounded the rock so that the Inferi holding Harry so tightly stumbled and faltered; they did not dare pass through the flames to get to the water. They dropped Harry; he hit the ground, slipped on the rock, and fell, grazing his arms, then scrambled back up, raising his wand and staring around.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是就在这时，黑暗中出现了腾腾的火焰：一个明亮的、金红色的火环环绕在岩石周围，那些紧紧抓住哈利的阴尸一具具变得脚步踉跄、身体摇晃。它们不敢穿过火焰进入湖水，只好扔下了哈利。哈利摔在地上，脚滑在岩石上，擦破了胳膊，但是他赶紧挣扎着爬起来，举起魔杖警惕地望着四周。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But though gashes appeared in their sodden rags and their icy skin, they had no blood to spill: They walked on, unfeeling, their shrunken hands outstretched toward him, and as he backed away still farther, he felt arms enclose him from behind, thin, fleshlcv. arms cold as death, and his feet left the ground as they lifted him and began to carry him, slowly and surely, back to the water, anil he knew there would be no release, that he would be drowned, and become one more dead guardian of a fragment of Voldemorts shattered soul…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阴尸们破烂的湿衣服和冰冷的皮肤上出现了深深的大口子，但没有一滴血流出来。它们无知无觉，继续一步步逼了过来，朝哈利伸出一双双干枯的手。哈利又往后退了几步，感觉有胳膊从后面搂住了他，那些像死亡一样冰冷、没有血肉的胳膊，把他从地面上抱了起来，缓缓地、但毫不犹豫地走向了黑湖。哈利知道他没有办法脱身，他肯定会被淹死的，成为另一具守护伏地魔某个灵魂碎片的阴尸……">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dumbledore scooped the locket from the bottom of the stone basin and stowed it inside his robes. Wordlessly, he gestured to Harry to come to his side. Distracted by the flames, the Inferi seemed unaware that their quarry was leaving as Dumbledore led Harry back to the boat, the ring of fire moving with them, around them, the bewildered Inferi accompanying them to the waters edge, where they slipped gratefully back into their dark waters.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="邓布利多从石盆底下捞起挂坠盒，塞进了他的长袍里面。他一言不发，示意哈利到他身边去。阴尸们被火焰弄昏了头脑，似乎没有意识到它们追捕的人正要离开小岛。这时邓布利多领着哈利向小船走去，那道光环围着他们一直移动。不知所措的阴尸们簇拥着他们来到湖边，迫不及待地重新滑入黑暗的湖水中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry, who was shaking all over, thought for a moment that Dumbledore might not be able to climb into the boat; he staggered a little as he attempted it; all his efforts seemed to be going into maintaining the ring of protective flame around them. Harry seized him and helped him back to his seat. Once they were both safely jammed inside again, the boat began to move back across the black water, away from the rock, still encircled by that ring of fire, and it seemed that the Inferi swarming below them did not dare resurface.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利浑身都在发抖，他以为邓布利多没有力气爬上小船了。邓布利多上船的时候脚步有些踉跄，他似乎在用全部的精力维持他们周围那道防护的光环。哈利扶着他，让他在小船里坐好。两人刚刚挤坐进去，小船就掠过漆黑的水面往回驶去，离开了仍然被火环包围的岩石。那些在水下漂浮的阴尸似乎再也不敢露面了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dumbledore was on his feet again, pale as any of the surrounding Inferi, but taller than any too, the fire dancing in his eyes; his wand was raised like a torch and from its tip emanated the flames, like a vast lasso, encircling them all with warmth. The Inferi bumped into each other, attempting, blindly, to escape the fire in which they were enclosed…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="邓布利多已经又站了起来，他的脸色像周围的阴尸一样惨白，但是个子比它们都高，火光在他的眼睛里跳动。他的魔杖像火把一样高高地举着，魔杖尖上蹿出一道道火焰，像一根巨大而温暖的套索，把阴尸们都围了起来。阴尸们互相撞在一起，晕头转向地想逃避围住它们的火焰……">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They reached the bank with a little bump and Harry leapt out, then turned quickly to help Dumbledore. The moment that Dumbledore reached the bank he let his wand hand fall; the ring of fire vanished, but the Inferi did not emerge again from the water. The little boat sank into the water once more; clanking and tinkling, its chain slithered back into the lake too. Dumbledore gave a great sigh and leaned against the cavern wall.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="随着砰的一声轻响，他们到了岸边，哈利抢先跳下小船，回身搀扶邓布利多。邓布利多刚一上岸，举着魔杖的手就垂了下去。火环消失了，但是阴尸没有再从湖里冒出来。小船又一次沉入水中，那根链条也丁丁当当地重新滑进湖水里。邓布利多重重地叹了一口气，身体靠在山洞的岩壁上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Quite understandable," murmured Dumbledore. Harry was alarmed to hear how faint his voice was.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可以理解。”邓布利多喃喃地说。哈利惊恐地听出他的声音十分虚弱。">查看中文翻译</div>
