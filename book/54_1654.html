<div class="line_en">The blue-black shine that had so nicely encircled T. J.'s left eye for over a week had almost completely faded by the morning T. J. hopped into the back of the wagon beside Stacey and snuggled in a corner not occupied by the butter, milk, and eggs Big Ma was taking to sell at the market in Strawberry. I sat up front beside Big Ma, still sandy-eyed and not believing that I was actually going.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="今天看到提杰时，他眼睛周围的淤青过了一周终于消散了。他钻进马车，车上堆着奶奶要拉到斯特罗贝里集市上卖的黄油、鸡蛋和牛奶。他挤过斯泰西，随便找了个空位坐了下来。我和奶奶坐在马车前排，奶奶似乎还受不了我的兴奋样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The second Saturday of every month was market day in Strawberry, and for as far back as I could remember the boys and I had been begging Big Ma to take us to it. Stacey had actually gone once, but Christopher-John, Little Man, and I had always been flatly denied the experience. We had, in fact, been denied so often that our pestering now occurred more out of habit than from any real belief that we would be allowed to go. But this morning, while the world lay black, Big Ma called: "Cassie, get up, child, if you gonna go to town with me, and be quiet 'bout it. You wake up Christopher-John or Little Man and I'll leave you here. I don't want them cryin' all over the place 'cause they can't go."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="每个月的第二个星期天是斯特罗贝里的赶集日。很久之前，我和男孩们就总是央求奶奶带我们去。斯泰西去过一次，我、克里斯托弗和小家伙总是被直截了当地拒绝。一直以来，我们频繁纠缠奶奶却未果，以至于也不再奢望赶集这件事情了。今天清晨，天还是蒙蒙亮的时候，奶奶叫醒我：“凯西，起床了，如果你想跟我去赶集的话就安静点，要是克里斯托弗和小家伙被吵醒了，我就不带你去了。我可不想被他们缠上老半天。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As Jack swept the wagon into the gray road, Big Ma pulled tightly on the reins and grumbled, "Hold on! You, Jack, hold on! I ain't got no time to be putting up with both you and T. J.'s foolishness."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杰克——我们家的马，拖着马车走到路上。奶奶紧紧拉住缰绳，咕哝道：“杰克，听话点！我可没什么闲工夫跟你和提杰瞎磨叽。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"T. J.!" Stacey and I exclaimed together. "He going!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“提杰！”我和斯泰西异口同声，“他也去？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Big Ma didn't answer immediately; she was occupied in a test of wills with Jack. When hers had prevailed and Jack had settled into a moderate trot, she replied moodily, "Mr. Avery come by after y'all was asleep last night wanting T. J. to go to Strawberry to do some shopping for a few things he couldn't get at the Wallace store. Lord, that's all I need with all the trouble about is for that child to talk me to death for twenty-two miles."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="奶奶并没有马上回答，她还忙着收拾杰克呢。等到杰克终于消停下来，她才说：“艾弗里先生昨晚来找我，说希望提杰能去斯特罗贝里买一些在华莱士商店买不到的东西。天哪，一想到这二十二英里的路程都要跟这个叽叽喳喳的孩子在一块儿，我就心烦！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">T. J., however, was surprisingly subdued when he settled into the wagon; I suppose that at three-thirty in the morning even T. J.'s mouth was tired. But by dawn, when the December sun was creeping warily upward shooting pale streams of buff-colored light through the forest, he was fully awake and chattering like a cockatoo. His endless talk made me wish that he had not managed to wheedle his way so speedily back into Stacey's good graces, but Big Ma, her face furrowed in distant thoughts, did not hush him. He talked the rest of the way into Strawberry, announcing as we arrived, "Well, children, open your eyes and take in Strawberry, Mississippi!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="奇怪的是，提杰上了马车后显得格外的安静。不过凌晨三点半出发，提杰的嘴也没什么力气叽叽喳喳。等到浅金色的阳光穿过云层，洒向十二月的静谧的森林时，提杰活了过来一般，像只鹦鹉一样说个不停。我真希望他的甜言蜜语别那么快使他和斯泰西和好如初。不过奶奶皱着眉沉思着，没有在意提杰的聒噪。到达时，奶奶大声说：“好啦，孩子们，我们到了！密西西比的斯特罗贝里！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Big Ma didn't need to say any more and she didn't. T. J. was far from her favorite person and it was quite obvious that Stacey and I owed our good fortune entirely to T. J.'s obnoxious personality.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="提杰大概是奶奶最讨厌的人了吧？而我和斯泰西像是上辈子欠了他好多钱一样，怎么都躲不开他。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Shoot!" I grumbled. "It sure ain't nothing to shout about."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“天哪！”我心生不满，“真是失望。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Is this it!" I cried, a gutting disappointment enveloping me as we entered the town. Strawberry was nothing like the tough, sprawling bigness I had envisioned. It was instead a sad, red place. As far as I could see, the only things modern about it were a paved road which cut through its center and fled northward, away from it, and a spindly row of electrical lines. Lining the road were strips of red dirt splotched with patches of brown grass and drying mud puddles, and beyond the dirt and the mud puddles, gloomy store buildings set behind raised wooden sidewalks and sagging verandas.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是这里吗？”一阵难言的失望笼罩着我。它跟我想象中的不断发展的现代城市简直有云泥之别，它看起来甚至有些凄凉。它唯一看起来还有些现代气息的，大概就是那条贯穿市中心、延伸向北的柏油马路，以及一排细长的电线杆。路旁的红色土地上，杂乱地堆着些枯草和发干的土块。再往前去，是一排死气沉沉的商店。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Hush up, Cassie," Big Ma said. "You too, T. J. Y'all in town now and I expects y'all to act like it. In another hour this place'll be teeming up with folks from all over the county and! don't want no trouble."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“凯西，闭嘴！”奶奶斥责我，“还有提杰也是。你们现在在城里，就要有个城里人的样子。再过一个小时，各个县的农夫们就要过来了，别给我惹麻烦。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As the stores gave way to houses still sleeping, we turned onto a dirt road which led past more shops and beyond to a wide field dotted with wooden stalls. Near the field entrance several farm wagons and pickups were already parked, but Big Ma drove to the other side of the field where only two wagons were stationed. Climbing from the wagon, she said, "Don't seem like too many folks ahead of us. In the summer, I'd've had to come on Friday and spend the night to get a spot like this." She headed toward the back of the wagon. "Stacey, you and T. J. stay up there a minute and push them milk cans over here so's I can reach 'em."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="再往前，住房也是沉睡的模样。我们拐到一条泥巴路上，经过一排商店，来到了设有木制摊位的广场。入口处，有几辆马车和货车停在那里，但奶奶把车子拉到了另一头——只有两辆马车停在那里。奶奶从马车上下来。“别看现在没什么人，以前夏天来的时候，我都得星期五出发，早早来占一个位置。”她走到马车后头，“斯泰西，你和提杰留在车上，帮我推一下牛奶罐，这样我才拿得到。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I studied the wagons parked at the field entrance. then exclaimed, "Well, what the devil we doing way back here then! Can't nobody see us."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我看着入口处停着的车，抱怨道：“我们为什么要来到这么偏僻的地方？谁也看不到我们！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Not all, I reckon. Some of 'em gets meats and vegetables, quilts and sewing and such. But I guess a good piece of 'em sellin' the same as us."</div>

<div class="line_en">"You watch your mouth, girl," warned Big Ma. Then, arranging the milk cans and baskets of eggs near the wagon's edge, she softened her voice and promised, "We'll do all right. I got me some regular customers and they'll check to see if I'm here 'fore they buy."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“闭嘴，凯西！”奶奶警告我，随即整理着马车上的牛奶罐和一篮篮鸡蛋。她缓了缓语气：“没事的，我有一些老主顾，他们会到这儿来买我们的东西的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“奶奶，”我跟着她，“来这里的人也卖牛奶和鸡蛋吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Not back here they won't," I grumbled. Maybe Big Ma knew what she was doing, but it made absolutely no sense to me to be so far from the entrance. Most of the other farmers seemed to have the right idea, and I couldn't help ii but try to make her see the business sense in moving the wagon forward. "Why don't we move our wagon up there with them other wagons, Big Ma! There's plenty of room, and we could sell more."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这么偏僻，他们才不会来呢。”我抱怨道。奶奶是知道自己在做什么吧？但对我来说，这实在是太匪夷所思了，为什么要把车停在离入口那么远的地方呢？大多数农夫都选择停在入口处，这样才有生意呀。“奶奶，为什么我们不把马车停到入口那个地方？那里还有空位，我们也可以卖得更好呀。”">查看中文翻译</div>
