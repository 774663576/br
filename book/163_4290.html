<div class="line_en">"No worries. Right now, many scientists have… seen something, like you. Everyone's distracted. But I think it's still best if you go visit her. She's getting on in years, and she won't hire a caretaker. If there's some task around the home that she needs help with, please help her… Oh, right, the cosmic microwave background.

<div class="line_en">Wang subconsciously thought of her as the long-obsolete DOS operating system: a blank, black screen, a bare "C:&gt;" prompt, a blinking cursor. Whatever you entered, it echoed back. Not one extra letter and not a single change. But now he knew that behind the "C:&gt;" was a bottomless abyss.</div>

<div class="line_en">After hanging up, Wang sat in front of his computer and printed out the simple Morse code chart. By now he was calm enough to turn his thoughts away from the countdown. He pondered the Frontiers of Science, Shen Yufei, and the computer game she had been playing. The only thing he knew for certain about Shen was that she wasn't the type to enjoy computer games. She spoke like a telegraph and gave him the impression that she was always extremely cold. It wasn't the kind of coldness that some people put on like a mask -- hers suffused her all the way through.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="打完电话后，汪淼坐到电脑前，开始打印网页上显示的那张很简单的莫尔斯电码对照表。这时他已经冷静下来，将思绪从倒计时上移开，想着关于“科学边界”和申玉菲的事，想到她玩的网络游戏。关于申玉菲，他能肯定的唯一一件事就是她不是爱玩游戏的人，这个说话如电报般精简的女人给他唯一的印象就是冷，她的冷与其他的某些女性不同，不是一张面具，而是从里到外冷透了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Wang entered the address for the game into the browser. It had been easy to memorize: www.3body. net. The site indicated that the game only supported access via V-suit. Wang remembered that the employee lounge at the Nanotechnology Research Center had a V-suit. He left the now-empty main lab and went to the security office to get the key. In the lounge, he passed the pool tables and the exercise machines and found the V-suit next to a computer. He struggled into the haptic feedback suit, put on the panoramic viewing helmet, and turned on the computer.</div>

<div class="line_en">After entering the game, Wang found himself in the middle of a desolate plain at dawn. The plain was dun-colored, blurry, its details hard to make out. In the distance, there was a sliver of white light on the horizon. Twinkling stars covered the rest of the sky.</div>

<div class="line_en">The plain remained desolate, but now the compressors in the V-suit whirred to life, and Wang could feel gusts of cold air against his body. Before him appeared two walking figures, forming dark silhouettes against the dawn light. Wang ran after them. He saw that both figures were male. They were dressed in long robes full of holes, covered by dirty animal hides. Each carried a short, wide bronze sword. One of them carried a narrow wooden trunk that was as long as half his height. He turned around to look at Wang. The man's face was as dirty and wrinkled as the hide he wore, but his eyes were sharp and lively, the pupils glinting in the early-morning glow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="荒朦依旧，但v装具感应服中的压缩机咝咝地启动了，汪淼感到一股逼人的寒气。前方出现了两个行走的人影，在曙光的背景里显现黑色的剪影。汪淼追了上去，他看到两人都是男性，披着破烂的长袍，外面还裹着一张肮脏的兽皮，都带着一把青铜时代那种又宽又短的剑。其中一人背着一只有他一半高的细长的木箱子，那人扭头看看汪淼。他的脸像那兽皮一样脏和皱，双眼却很有神，眸子映着曙光。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As they spoke, Wang noticed the sky brightening over another part of the horizon. He couldn't be sure of the compass directions, but he was sure the direction this time was different from last time. The sky grew brighter, and soon, the sun of this world rose. It was small and bluish in color, like a very bright moon. Wang still felt a bit of warmth, and could now see the landscape around him more clearly. But the day didn't last long. The sun traversed a shallow arc over the horizon and soon set. Night and the bone-chilling cold once more settled over everything.</div>

<div class="line_en">The three travelers stopped in front of a dead tree. King Wen and Follower took out their bronze swords to chop the tree into firewood, and Wang gathered the firewood into a pile. Follower took out a piece of flint and struck it against a blade until the sparks caught. The fire soon warmed the front of Wang's V-suit, but his back remained cold.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="三人在一棵枯树前停下，周文王和追随者拔出青铜剑来砍柴，汪淼将碎柴收集到一块，追随者拿出火镰，噼啪、噼啪打了好一阵，升起了一堆火。汪淼的感应服的前胸部分变暖和了，但背后仍然冰冷。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="篝火燃尽后，三人继续赶路。由于他们之间交谈很少，系统加快了游戏时间的流逝速度，周文王很快将背上的沙漏翻了六下，转眼间两天过去了，太阳还没有升起过一次，甚至天边连曙光的影子都没有。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="这话说完不久，天边真的出现了曙光，并且迅速增强，转眼问太阳就升了起来，汪淼发现这次升起的是一颗大太阳。当它升至一半时，直径占了视野内至少五分之一的地平线。暖流扑面而来，令汪淼心旷神怡，但他看周文王和追随者时，发现他们都一脸惊恐，仿佛魔鬼降临。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Quick! Find shade!" Follower shouted. Wang ran after them. They ducked behind a large rock. The shadow cast by the rock gradually grew shorter and shorter.

<div class="line_cn" title="“快，找阴凉地儿！”追随者大喊，汪淼跟着他们飞奔，跑到了一处低矮的岩石后面蹲下采。岩石的阴影在渐渐缩短，周围的大地像处于白炽状态般刺眼，脚下的冻土迅速融化，由坚硬如铁变成泥泞一片，热浪滚滚，汪淼很快出汗了。">查看中文翻译</div>

The sound was generated by the numerous giant pendulums that could be seen all over Zhao Ge, each tens of meters in height. The weight of each pendulum was a giant rock, suspended from a thick rope tied to a bridge that stretched between the tops of two slender stone towers. All the pendulums were swinging as groups of soldiers in armor kept them in motion. Chanting incomprehensibly, they rhythmically pulled ropes attached to the giant stone weights, adding to the pendulums' arcs as they slowed. Wang noticed that all the pendulums swung in step. From far away, the sight was awe-inducing: It was as though numerous giant clocks had been erected over the earth, or colossal, abstract symbols had fallen from the sky.</div>

<div class="line_en">The giant pendulums surrounded an even more enormous pyramid, standing like a tall mountain in the dark night. This was King Zhou's palace. Wang followed King Wen into a low door at the base of the pyramid, before which a few soldiers patrolled in the darkness, noiseless as ghosts.

Fu Xi sighed, lifted the pot, and drank in great gulps, the sound of his swallows echoing like the beating of a giant heart in the darkness. After he was halfway done with the contents, he poured the rest over his body. Then he threw down the pot and walked toward a large bronze cauldron suspended over a fire in the corner of the Great Hall. He climbed onto the edge of the cauldron and jumped in, stirring up a cloud of vapor.</div>

<div class="line_en">"This is Fu Xi." King Zhou introduced the man in black to Wang and King Wen. He spoke as though Wang and King Wen had always been there, while the man in black was the newcomer. "He thinks that the sun is a temperamental god. When the god is awake, his moods are unpredictable, and thus we have a Chaotic Era. But when he's asleep, his breathing evens out, and thus we have a Stable Era. Fu Xi suggested that I build those pendulums you see out there and keep them in constant motion. He claims that the pendulums can have a hypnotic effect on the sun god and cause him to sink into a long slumber. But we can all see that so far, the sun god remains awake, though from time to time he seems to nap briefly."</div>

<div class="line_en">A column of soldiers shouted, "Rehydrate! Rehydrate!" as they ran toward a large stone building, shaped like a granary, next to the lake. On the road to Zhao Ge, Wang had seen many buildings like it, and King Wen had told him that these buildings were called dehydratories, warehouses where the dehydrated bodies could be stored. The soldiers opened the heavy stone doors of the dehydratory and carried out rolls of dusty skins. Each soldier walked to the lakeshore, and tossed them into the water. As soon as the skins touched the water, they began to unfurl and stretch out. Soon, the lake was covered by a layer of man-shaped floating skins, each rapidly absorbing the water and expanding. Gradually, all the man-shaped skin cutouts became fleshy bodies that gradually began to display signs of life. One by one, they struggled up out of the waist-deep water and stood up. Looking around at the sunny world with wide-open eyes, they appeared to have just awoken from a dream.</div>

<div class="line_en">As soon as the order was given, everyone in the Great Hall rushed to the door. Wang followed King Wen closely, and they exited the pyramid through the long tunnel they'd entered by. When they emerged, Wang saw the noonday sun bathing the land in warmth. In a passing breeze he seemed to smell the fragrances of spring. Together, King Wen and Wang walked to a nearby lake. The ice over the lake had melted, and sunlight danced between the gentle waves.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="听到这号令，大殿内的人都跑向洞门。在周文王的示意下，汪淼跟着他沿着长长的隧道向金字，塔外走去。走出洞门，汪淼看到时值正午，太阳在当空静静地照耀着大地，微风吹过，他似乎嗅到了春天的气息。周文王和汪淼一同来到了距金字塔不远的一处湖畔，湖面上的冰已融化了，阳光在微波间跳动。">查看中文翻译</div>
