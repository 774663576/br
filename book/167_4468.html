<div class="line_en">Confusion and clangor ruled the castle. Men stood on the beds of wagons loading casks of wine, sacks of flour, and bundles of new-fletched arrows. Smiths straightened swords, knocked dents from breastplates, and shoed destriers and pack mules alike. Mail shirts were tossed in barrels of sand and rolled across the lumpy surface of the Flowstone Yard to scour them clean. Weese's women had twenty cloaks to mend, a hundred more to wash. The high and humble crowded into the sept together to pray. Outside the walls, tents and pavilions were coming down. Squires tossed pails of water over cookfires, while soldiers took out their oilstones to give their blades one last good lick. The noise was a swelling tide: horses blowing and whickering, lords shouting commands, men-at-arms trading curses, camp followers squabbling.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ser Addam Marbrand was the first of the captains to depart, a day before the rest. He made a gallant show of it, riding a spirited red courser whose mane was the same copper color as the long hair that streamed past Ser Addam's shoulders. The horse was barded in bronze-colored trappings dyed to match the rider's cloak and emblazoned with the burning tree. Some of the castle women sobbed to see him go. Weese said he was a great horseman and sword fighter, Lord Tywin's most daring commander.</div>

<div class="line_en">I hope he dies, Arya thought as she watched him ride out the gate, his men streaming after him in a double column. I hope they all die. They were going to fight Robb, she knew. Listening to the talk as she went about her work, Arya had learned that Robb had won some great victory in the west. He'd burned Lannisport, some said, or else he meant to burn it. He'd captured Casterly Rock and put everyone to the sword, or he was besieging the Golden Tooth… but something had happened, that much was certain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="希望他一命呜呼，艾莉亚一边看他骑出城门，心里一边想。他的部下在他身后排成两列，鱼贯而出。希望他们统统死掉。他们是去跟罗柏打仗，她知道的。最近，艾莉亚四处走动干活时常听人们谈论，似乎罗柏在西境打了个大胜仗。有人说他烧了兰尼斯港，有人说他只是打算要烧。有人说他夺下凯岩城，处死了所有居民，又有人说他正在围攻金牙城，众说纷纭…但确实有事发生，这点毋庸置疑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Weese had her running messages from dawn to dusk. Some of them even took her beyond the castle walls, out into the mud and madness of the camp. I could flee, she thought as a wagon rumbled past her. I could hop on the back of a wagon and hide, or fall in with the camp followers, no one would stop me. She might have done it if not for Weese. He'd told them more than once what he'd do to anyone who tried to run off on him. "It won't be no beating, oh, no. I won't lay a finger on you. I'll just save you for the Qohorik, yes I will, I'll save you for the Crippler. Vargo Hoat his name is, and when he gets back he'll cut off your feet."

<div class="line_en">Weese never imagined she could read, though, so he never bothered to seal the messages he gave her. Arya peeked at them all, but they were never anything good, just stupid stuff sending this cart to the granary and that one to the armory. One was a demand for payment on a gambling debt, but the knight she gave it to couldn't read. When she told him what it said he tried to hit her, but Arya ducked under the blow, snatched a silver-banded drinking horn off his saddle, and darted away. The knight roared and came after her, but she slid between two wayns, wove through a crowd of archers, and jumped a latrine trench. In his mail he couldn't keep up. When she gave the horn to Weese, he told her that a smart little Weasel like her deserved a reward. "I've got my eye on a plump crisp capon to sup on tonight. We'll share it, me and you. You'll like that."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而威斯根本料不到她识字，因此从不费神封信。于是艾莉亚偷看了所有的内容，却找不到有用的东西，全是诸如将这辆车送去谷仓，那辆车送去军械库之类的蠢笨事。曾有一封信是索要赌债，但收信的骑士不识字，她只好把信的内容说了出来，他一听出手便打，却被艾莉亚猫腰躲过，还顺手从他马鞍上抓了一只镶银角杯，拔腿就跑。骑士咆哮着追她，但她身手敏捷，先是从两辆车之间溜过，接着钻过一群弓箭手，跃过一个便池。而他穿着锁甲，根本追不上。当她将角杯交给威斯，他夸奖她，说像她这么聪明的小黄鼠狼值得奖励，“我瞅准一只肥嘟嘟的公鸡，今晚就把它弄来当晚饭。我们分了它，我和你，你会喜欢的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Everywhere she went, Arya searched for Jaqen H'ghar, wanting to whisper another name to him before those she hated were all gone out of her reach, but amidst the chaos and confusion the Lorathi sellsword was not to be found. He still owed her two deaths, and she was worried she would never get them if he rode off to battle with the rest. Finally she worked up the courage to ask one of the gate guards if he'd gone. "One of Lorch's men, is he?" the man said. "He won't be going, then. His lordship's named Ser Amory castellan of Harrenhal. That whole lot's staying right here, to hold the castle. The Bloody Mummers will be left as well, to do the foraging. That goat Vargo Hoat is like to spit, him and Lorch have always hated each other."</div>

<div class="line_en">Arya took the paper and ran. The armory adjoined the castle smithy, a long high-roofed tunnel of a building with twenty forges built into its walls and long stone water troughs for tempering the steel. Half of the forges were at work when she entered. The walls rang with the sound of hammers, and burly men in leather aprons stood sweating in the sullen heat as they bent over bellows and anvils. When she spied Gendry, his bare chest was slick with sweat, but the blue eyes under the heavy black hair had the stubborn look she remembered. Arya didn't know that she even wanted to talk to him. It was his fault they'd all been caught. "Which one is Lucan?" She thrust out the paper. "I'm to get a new sword for Ser Lyonel."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="艾莉亚接过单子，跑了出去。军械库跟铁匠房毗邻，那铁匠房是一栋长条状的建筑，高高的屋顶，墙里嵌了二十个火炉，还有长长的石水槽，用来给钢铁焯火。她进去时，一半火炉都在运作。墙壁间回响着铁锤的敲打声，发出共鸣。魁梧结实的人们围着皮裙，俯身站在风箱和铁砧前，在滞闷的热气中挥汗如雨。她斜眼瞥见詹德利，他裸露的胸膛因汗水而显得光亮平滑，浓密黑发下的蓝眼睛仍有记忆中的固执。都是因为他，他们才全部被抓，艾莉亚不确定自己是否还想跟他说话。“哪位是卢坎？”她将纸递出去。“我要为莱昂诺爵士取一把新剑。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Weasel," Weese said that afternoon. "Get to the armory and tell Lucan that Ser Lyonel notched his sword in practice and needs a new one. Here's his mark." He handed her a square of paper. "Be quick about it now, he's to ride with Ser Kevan Lannister."</div>

<div class="line_en">The longsword was a lot heavier than Needle had been, but Arya liked the feel of it. The weight of steel in her hands made her feel stronger. Maybe I'm not a water dancer yet, but I'm not a mouse either. A mouse couldn't use a sword but I can. The gates were open, soldiers coming and going, drays rolling in empty and going out creaking and swaying under their loads. She thought about going to the stables and telling them that Ser Lyonel wanted a new horse. She had the paper, the stableboys wouldn't be able to read it any better than Lucan had. I could take the horse and the sword and just ride out. If the guards tried to stop me I'd show them the paper and say I was bringing everything to Ser Lyonel. She had no notion what Ser Lyonel looked like or where to find him, though. If they questioned her, they'd know, and then Weese… Weese…</div>

<div class="line_en">You won't, Arya thought. You won't ever again. But she ran. The old gods of the north must have been guiding her steps. Halfway to the brewhouse, as she passing under the stone bridge that arched between Widow's Tower and Kingspyre, she heard harsh, growling laughter. Rorge came around a corner with three other men, the manticore badge of Ser Amory sewn over their hearts. When he saw her, he stopped and grinned, showing a mouthful of crooked brown teeth under the leather flap he wore sometimes to cover the hole in his face. "Yoren's little cunt," he called her. "Guess we know why that black bastard wanted you on the Wall, don't we?" He laughed again, and the others laughed with him. "Where's your stick now?" Rorge demanded suddenly, the smile gone as quick as it had come. "Seems to me I promised to fuck you with it." He took a step toward her. Arya edged backward. "Not so brave now that I'm not in chains, are you?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="你不会，艾莉亚心想，你再也不会了。但她还是奔跑起来。北方的古老诸神指引着她的脚步。去酿酒房的半路上，当她从连接寡妇塔和焚王塔的石拱桥下经过时，听见刺耳的嚎笑。罗尔杰跟另外三人从拐角转出来，他们胸前都缝有亚摩利爵士的狮身蝎尾兽徽章。他一见她，便止了步，朝她咧嘴笑，用来掩盖脸上空洞的护鼻底下，露出满口弯曲棕黄的牙齿。“尤伦的小骚货，”他叫她。“这下我们终于明白那黑衣杂种干嘛带你去长城了，对不对？”他大笑起来，其他人也跟着一起笑。“你那根棍子呢？”罗尔杰突然问，笑容刹时消失，“记得我说过要拿它活活干死你。”他走近一步。艾莉亚慢慢后退。“我没链子拴着，你这小王八蛋就吓破了胆，对吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

Get down to the brewhouse and tell Tuffleberry that I have two dozen barrels for him, but he better send his lads to fetch them or I'll find someone wants 'em worse." Arya started off, but not quick enough for Weese. "You run if you want to eat tonight," he shouted, his promises of a plump crisp capon already forgotten.

<div class="line_en">Jaqen H'ghar closed his eyes again, floating languid, half-asleep. "Tell his lordship a man shall attend him at his leisure." His hand moved suddenly, splashing hot water at her, and Arya had to leap back to keep from getting drenched.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="贾昆·赫加尔的眼睛再度合上，他懒洋洋地泡在水里，似乎快睡着了。“告诉大人，某人随叫随到。”他的手突然一抖，把热水朝她泼来，艾莉亚赶紧跳开，才没淋成落汤鸡。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When she told Tuffleberry what Weese had said, the brewer cursed loudly. "You tell Weese my lads got duties to attend to, and you tell him he's a pox-ridden bastard too, and the seven hells will freeze over before he gets another horn of my ale.

<div class="line_en">Supper that evening was a thin stew of barley, onion, and carrots, with a wedge of stale brown bread. One of the women had taken to sleeping in Weese's bed, and she got a piece of ripe blue cheese as well, and a wing off the capon that Weese had spoken of that morning. He ate the rest himself, the grease running down in a shiny line through the boils that festered at the corner of his mouth. The bird was almost gone when he glanced up from his trencher and saw Arya staring. "Weasel, come here."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当天的晚饭是加了洋葱和胡萝卜的稀麦粥，还有一块不太新鲜的黑面包。有个女人被叫去和威斯上床，所以多得了一块成熟的蓝奶酪和一只鸡翅——从威斯早上提到的那只鸡上撕下来的。其余部分他一人独享，油脂闪着光亮，流淌过他嘴角化脓的疖子。鸡快吃完时，他才从盘子里抬头，发现艾莉亚正盯着他看。“黄鼠狼，过来。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="当然，艾莉亚回报时省略了“满脸疖子”这部分，但威斯依旧气得发疯。他怒气冲冲，骂骂咧咧，但最终还是找来六个人，嘟嘟囔囔地命他们把桶送去酿酒房。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Weese," Arya whispered that night as she bent over the tear in her shift. "Dunsen, Polliver, Raff the Sweetling," she said, calling a name every time she pushed the bone needle through the undyed wool. "The Tickler and the Hound. Ser Gregor, Ser Amory, Ser Ilyn, Ser Meryn, King Joffrey, Queen Cersei." She wondered how much longer she would have to include Weese in her prayer, and drifted off to sleep dreaming that on the morrow, when she woke, he'd be dead.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“威斯，”那天晚上，艾莉亚一边俯身补裙子，一边低声说。“邓森，波利佛，‘甜嘴’拉夫，”骨针缝过褪色的羊毛布一次，她就念出一个名字。“记事本和猎狗。格雷果爵士，亚摩利爵士，伊林爵士，马林爵士，乔佛里国王，瑟曦太后。”她不知威斯还会在她的祷词里停留多久，真希望明天一早醒来，他已经死去，她想啊想，最后昏沉睡去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I saw you looking at me." Weese wiped his fingers on the front of her shift. Then he grabbed her throat with one hand and slapped her with the other. "What did I tell you?" He slapped her again, backhand. "Keep those eyes to yourself, or next time I'll spoon one out and feed it to my bitch." A shove sent her stumbling to the floor. Her hem caught on a loose nail in the splintered wooden bench and ripped as she fell. "You'll mend that before you sleep," Weese announced as he pulled the last bit of meat off the capon. When he was finished he sucked his fingers noisily, and threw the bones to his ugly spotted dog.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你在看我，我看见了。”威斯在她衣服前襟擦擦手指，然后一手掐住她脖子，一手扇了她一巴掌。“我跟你是怎么说的？”他反手又是一巴掌。“不许东张西望！否则我抠你眼睛出来喂母狗！”她被推倒在地，倒下时衣服边缘挂住木凳裂缝上的钉子，勾破了。“不把它补好，今晚你就别睡！”威斯宣布，一边扯下最后一点鸡肉。吃得精光之后，他响亮地吮吸手指，并把骨头丢给他那条丑陋的斑点狗。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A few mouthfuls of dark meat still clung to one thigh. He forgot, but now he's remembered, Arya thought. It made her feel bad for telling Jaqen to kill him. She got off the bench and went to the head of the table.</div>

<div class="line_en">Pale light filled the yard when Lord Tywin Lannister took his leave of Harrenhal. Arya watched from an arched window halfway up the Wailing Tower. His charger wore a blanket of enameled crimson scales and gilded crinet and charnfron, while Lord Tywin himself sported a thick ermine cloak. His brother Ser Kevan looked near as splendid. No less than four standard-bearers went before them, carrying huge crimson banners emblazoned with the golden lion. Behind the Lannisters came their great lords and captains. Their banners flared and flapped, a pageant of color: red ox and golden mountain, purple unicorn and bantam rooster, brindled boar and badger, a silver ferret and a juggler in motley, stars and sunbursts, peacock and panther, chevron and dagger, black hood and blue beetle and green arrow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当淡淡的曙光射进庭院时，泰温·兰尼斯特公爵离开了赫伦堡。艾莉亚爬到号哭塔上一个拱窗边观察。他的战马披一袭猩红的釉彩鳞片甲，戴着镀金的护颈和头套，泰温公爵自己则身披一件厚重的貂皮斗篷。他的弟弟凯文爵士骑在他身旁，同样雍容华贵。四个掌旗官走在他们前面，高举深红大旗，怒吼雄狮迎风招展。兰尼斯特兄弟之后，跟着领主和军官们，旗帜飞扬，炫丽多彩：有红色的公牛，金色的山峰，紫色的独角兽和矮脚公鸡，斑纹野猪和獾，银色的雪鼯和五彩艺人，以及星星，太阳，孔雀，黑豹，尖角，匕首，黑色的兜帽，蓝色的甲虫和绿色的箭只。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But it was the sharp toe of Weese's boot that woke her, as ever. The main strength of Lord Tywin's host would ride this day, he told them as they broke their fast on oatcakes. "Don't none of you be thinking how easy it'll be here once m'lord of Lannister is gone," he warned. "The castle won't grow no smaller, I promise you that, only now there'll be fewer hands to tend to it. You lot of slugabeds are going to learn what work is now, yes you are."</div>

<div class="line_en">A shiver crept up Arya's spine as she watched them pass under the great iron portcullis of Harrenhal. Suddenly she knew that she had made a terrible mistake. I'm so stupid, she thought. Weese did not matter, no more than Chiswyck had. These were the men who mattered, the ones she ought to have killed. Last night she could have whispered any of them dead, if only she hadn't been so mad at Weese for hitting her and lying about the capon. Lord Tywin, why didn't I say Lord Tywin?</div>
