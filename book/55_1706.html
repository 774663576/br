<div class="line_en">Historians consider the Treaty of Westphalia of 1648 not only to have put out the Wars of Religion but to have established the first version of the modern international order. Europe was now partitioned into sovereign states rather than being a crazy quilt of jurisdictions nominally overseen by the Pope and the Holy Roman Emperor. This Age of Sovereignty saw the ascendancy of states that were still linked to dynasties and religions but that really hung their prestige on their governments, territories, and commercial empires. It was this gradual consolidation of sovereign states (culminating a process that began well before 1648) that set off the two opposing trends that have emerged from every statistical study of war we have seen: wars were getting less frequent but more damaging.</div>

<div class="line_en">A major reason wars declined in number was that the units that could fight each other declined in number. Recall from chapter 3 that the number of political units in Europe shrank from five hundred around the time of the Thirty Years' War to fewer than thirty in the 1950s. Now, you might think that this makes the decline in the frequency of wars just an accounting trick. With the stroke of an eraser, diplomats remove a line on a map that separates warring parties and magically take their conflict out of the "interstate war" books and hide it in the "civil war" books. But in fact the reduction is real. As Richardson showed, when we hold area constant, there are far fewer civil wars within national boundaries than there are interstate wars crossing them. (Just think of England, which hasn't had a true civil war in 350 years, but has fought many interstate wars since then.) It is another illustration of the logic of the Leviathan. As small baronies and duchies coalesced into larger kingdoms, the centralized authorities prevented them from warring with each other for the same reason that they prevented individual citizens from murdering each other (and that farmers prevent their livestock from killing each other): as far as an overlord is concerned, private quarrels within his domain are a dead loss. The reduction in the frequency of war is thus another manifestation of Elias's Civilizing Process.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="战争数量下降的主要原因是参战的政治实体的数量减少了。回想一下第3章的内容，欧洲政治实体在“三十年战争”期间为500个左右，到20世纪50年代只有不到30个。你也许会认为，这种数量下降只是一个计算上的小把戏。只要动动橡皮，外交家们就能抹掉地图上两军对峙的分界线，将某些冲突从史书的“国际战争”章节中抽出来，塞进“内战”部分。现实世界中，这种下降是真实的。理查森向我们表明，即使我们保持欧洲内部的边界不变，国家内部的战争也远远少于国家之间的战争。（以英国为例，已经有350年未曾发生真正的内战，但它参与了众多的国际战争。）这是利维坦逻辑成立的又一个例证。小王公封侯联合组成较大的王国，中央权威防止王国内部各方互相开战，其理由和王公诸侯制止属民互相谋杀，以及农夫阻止他饲养的牲畜相互残杀的理由完全相同：对于主人来说，辖区内私人之间的争斗是净损失。因此，战争数量的减少也是埃利亚斯“文明的进程”的一个体现。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In times of war…, the managers of full-fledged states often commissioned privateers, hired sometime bandits to raid their enemies, and encouraged their regular troops to take booty. In royal service, soldiers and sailors were often expected to provide for themselves by preying on the civilian population: commandeering, raping, looting, taking prizes. When demobilized, they commonly continued the same practices, but without the same royal protection; demobilized ships became pirate vessels, demobilized troops bandits.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在战时…国家的管理者经常向私人发包战争，有时也雇用匪帮袭击敌国，鼓励自己的正规军劫掠战利品。虽然是为王家服役，但士兵和水兵们通常是依靠搜刮百姓维持自己的开销，征用、强奸和抢劫都是家常便饭。一旦军队解散，他们会继续干自己的老行当，只是没有了王家的保护。退役的军舰转身就是海盗船只，退役的军人立刻就变成土匪。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The greater lethality of the wars that did take place was the result of a development called the military revolution. States got serious about war. This was partly a matter of improved weaponry, especially cannons and guns, but it was more a matter of recruiting greater numbers of people to kill and be killed. In medieval Europe and the Age of Dynasties, rulers were understandably nervous about arming large numbers of their peasants and training them in combat. (One can hear them asking themselves: What could possibly go wrong?) Instead they assembled ad hoc militias by hiring mercenaries or conscripting miscreants and ne'er-do-wells who could not buy their way out. In his essay "War Making and State Making as Organized Crime," Charles Tilly wrote:</div>

<div class="line_en">The motto for the criminal, after all, is not a variation of "Semper fi," "All for one and one for all," "Duty, honor, country," "Banzai," or "Remember Pearl Harbor," but "Take the money and run." Indeed, for a criminal to perish in battle (or in the commission of a bank robbery) is essentially absurd; it is profoundly irrational to die for the thrill of violence and even more so for the procurement of booty, because you can't, after all, take either one with you.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="说到底，罪犯们的座右铭绝对不会是“永远忠诚”“人人为我，我为人人”“责任、荣誉、国家”“（天皇）万岁”或者“铭记珍珠港”，而是“捞到钱赶紧逃”。确实，对一个罪犯来说，在战场上送命（或者在受雇去抢劫银行的行动中送命）是最最莫名其妙的事情；为了追求暴力的激动去死，或者为了获得战利品而死，实在太缺乏理性了，因为一旦人死了，就什么也享受不到了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As armed forces became more unified and permanent, they also became more effective. The thugs who had made up the earlier militias could hurt a lot of civilians, but they were not terribly effective in organized combat because bravery and discipline held no appeal. Mueller explains:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="正规化和常备化的军队当然也更有效率。初期由土匪流氓组成的民兵能够对平民造成严重伤害，但这些人既缺乏勇气又没有纪律，他们在有组织的战斗中非常没有效率。米勒解释说：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It also worked the other way: A king's best source of armed supporters was sometimes the world of outlaws. Robin Hood's conversion to royal archer may be a myth, but the myth records a practice. The distinctions between "legitimate" and "illegitimate" users of violence came clear only very slowly, in the process during which the states' armed forces became relatively unified and permanent.</div>

<div class="line_en">But during the military revolution of the 16th and 17th centuries, states began to form professional standing armies. They conscripted large numbers of men from a cross section of society rather than just from the dregs at the bottom. They used a combination of drill, indoctrination, and brutal punishment to train them for organized combat. And they instilled in them a code of discipline, stoicism, and valor. The result was that when two of these armies clashed, they could rack up high body counts in a hurry.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是在16世纪和17世纪的军事革命中，国家开始组织职业常备军。他们从社会的各个阶层进行大规模征募，不再仅仅收纳社会底层的渣滓。他们将演习、训导和严酷的惩罚相结合，训练士兵从事有组织的战斗。他们向士兵灌输纪律、毅力和勇气这样的职业守则。结果是一旦两支这样的军队交火，瞬息之间就会造成惨重的伤亡。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The military historian Azar Gat has argued that "revolution" is a misnomer for what was really a gradual development. The process of making armies more effective was part of the centuries-long wave of technological and organizational change that made everything more effective. Perhaps an even greater advance in battlefield carnage than the original military revolution has been attributed to Napoleon, who replaced set battles in which both sides tried to conserve their soldiers with bold attacks in which a country would deploy every available resource to inflict all-out defeat on its enemy. Yet another "advance" was the tapping of the Industrial Revolution, beginning in the 19th century, to feed and equip ever larger quantities of soldiers and transport them to the battlefront more quickly. The renewable supply of cannon fodder stoked the games of attrition that pushed wars farther out along the tail of the power-law distribution.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="军事史学家阿扎尔·加特曾经说，“革命”一词在此可算是用词不当，因为军事进步是一个渐进的发展。以高效为目的的技术进步和组织进步历时几个世纪，提高军队各个部分的效率的过程是这一变迁大潮的组成部分。也许，与其说是军事革命本身，不如说是拿破仑的作战方式让战场成为屠宰场。他改变了原来交战双方努力保存兵力的做法，代之以倾全力进攻的战术。拿破仑之后，任何一个国家要想打败对手，都只能穷兵黩武，竭尽所有的人力、物力投入战场。而另一场“进步”——19世纪开始的工业革命的脚步声已经响起，它装备起更大规模的军队，更迅速地将士兵运往前线。炮灰是可再生的供给，消耗博弈中源源不断的士兵生命，将战争一步步推向幂律分布长尾的远端。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">During this long run-up in military power, there was a second force (together with the consolidation of states) that drove down the frequency of combat. Many historians have seen the 18th century as a time of respite in the long European history of war. In the preceding chapter I mentioned that imperial powers like Holland, Sweden, Denmark, Portugal, and Spain stopped competing in the great power game and redirected their energies from conquest to commerce. Brecke writes of a "relatively pacific 18th century" (at least from 1713 to 1789), which can be seen as a U in figure 5-17 and as a shallow lopsided W between the peaks for the religious and French wars in figure 5-18. Luard notes that in the Age of Sovereignty from 1648 to 1789, "objectives were often relatively limited; and many wars in any case ended in a draw, from which no country secured its maximum aims. Many wars were lengthy, but the method of fighting was often deliberately restrained and casualties were less heavy than in either the preceding age or subsequent ages." To be sure, the century saw some bloody combat, such as the world war known as the Seven Years' War, but as David Bell notes, "Historians need to be able to make distinctions between shades of horror, and if the eighteenth century did not exactly reduce the slavering dogs of war to 'performing poodles'…, its conflicts still ranked among the least horrific in European history."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在这个军事大国急剧膨胀的时期，除了国家整合之外，还有一种力量也在促使战争的频率下降。许多历史学家都注意到，在漫长的欧洲战争史上，18世纪是一个间歇期。在前一章中我已经提到一些帝国，比如荷兰、瑞典、丹麦、葡萄牙和西班牙停止了大国竞争博弈，转向占领商业领域。布莱克称之为“相对平静的18世纪”（至少从1713年至1789年是相对平静的），在图5—17中，这一时期的曲线呈U形。在图5—18中，18世纪是宗教战争和法国动荡之间的低洼的W型。卢亚德表示，从1648年到1789年的“主权时代”，“目标通常相对有限，许多战争都是在不分胜负的情况下结束的，由此可以说没有哪个国家能实现其最终目标。战争是漫长的，但是作战的手法相当克制，伤亡比前一个时代和后一个时代都要小”。可以肯定，这个世纪也有非常血腥的战斗，比如被称为“七年战争”的世界大战。但是，戴维·贝尔认为，“历史学家必须有能力在恐怖的阴影下辨识事实，即使18世纪并没有真的将龇牙咧嘴的猎犬变为‘娱乐哈巴狗’…这期间的冲突在欧洲历史上也是属于恐怖程度最低的”。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As we saw in chapter 4, this tranquillity was a part of the Humanitarian Revolution connected with the Age of Reason, the Enlightenment, and the dawn of classical liberalism. The calming of religious fervor meant that wars were no longer inflamed with eschatological meaning, so leaders could cut deals rather than fight to the last man. Sovereign states were becoming commercial powers, which tend to favor positive-sum trade over zero-sum conquest. Popular writers were deconstructing honor, equating war with murder, ridiculing Europe's history of violence, and taking the viewpoints of soldiers and conquered peoples. Philosophers were redefining government from a means of implementing the whims of a monarch to a means for enhancing the life, liberty, and happiness of individual people, and tried to think up ways to limit the power of political leaders and incentivize them to avoid war. The ideas trickled upward and infiltrated the attitudes of at least some of the rulers of the day. While their "enlightened absolutism" was still absolutism, it was certainly better than unenlightened absolutism. And liberal democracy (which, as we shall see, appears to be a pacifying force) got its first toeholds in the United States and Great Britain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="正如我们在第4章中所见，这片宁静是与“理性时代”“启蒙运动”和“古典自由主义”相连接的人道主义革命所带来的。宗教狂热退烧让战争不再具有末世审判的意义，交战双方的首领们可以谈判协商，而不是一定要战斗到最后一兵一卒。许多主权国家成为商贸大国，它们更愿意看见正和博弈的贸易，而不是零和博弈的征服。作家们对战争荣誉进行解构，对暴力历史进行批判，并将士兵和被征服者的感受带给读者。哲学家们重新定义政府，以前政府是实现君主狂想的工具，现在政府是保证人民作为个体人的生命、自由和幸福的手段，并且思想家们还在思考如何约束政治领袖的权力，迫使他们尽量避免战争。当时的一些统治者逐渐受到这些思想的影响，或者至少受到感染。尽管这些“开明的专制”仍然是专制，但总是强过不开明的专制。而作为和平力量的自由民主制度，终于在美国和英国找到了最初的落脚点。">查看中文翻译</div>
