<div class="line_en">Dumbledore stood up. He stared down at Barty Crouch for a moment with disgust on his face. Then he raised his wand once more and ropes flew out of it, ropes that twisted themselves around Barty Crouch, binding him tightly. He turned to Professor McGonagall.</div>

Tell him I will be in the hospital wing in half an hour's time if he needs me."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他们来到石头怪兽跟前。邓布利多说了口令，怪兽左右分开，他和哈利走上活动的螺旋楼梯，来到橡木大门前。邓布利多把门推开。小天狼星就站在那里。他脸色苍白，面容消瘦，就像他刚从阿兹卡班逃出来时那样。他一眨眼就从房间那头奔了过来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"They are with Professor Sprout," said Dumbledore. His voice, which had been so calm throughout the interrogation of Barty Crouch, shook very slightly for the first time. "She was Head of Cedric's house, and knew him best."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他们和斯普劳特教授在一起。”邓布利多说。他的声音在审问小巴蒂·克劳奇的过程中一直是那么平稳镇定，现在第一次有些发颤。“斯普劳特教授是塞德里克那个学院的院长，对他最了解。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry nodded. A kind of numbness and a sense of complete unreality were upon him, but he did not care; he was even glad of it. He didn't want to have to think about anything that had happened since he had first touched the Triwizard Cup. He didn't want to have to examine the memories, fresh and sharp as photographs, which kept flashing across his mind. Mad-Eye Moody, inside the trunk. Wormtail, slumped on the ground, cradling his stump of an arm. Voldemort, rising from the steaming cauldron. Cedric… dead… Cedric, asking to be returned to his parents…</div>

So tired every bone in his body was aching, he wanted nothing more than to sit here, undisturbed, for hours and hours, until he fell asleep and didn't have to think or feel anymore.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="邓布利多开始向小天狼星原原本本地讲述小巴蒂·克劳奇所说的一切。哈利心不在焉地听着。他太累了，身上的每根骨头都在隐隐作痛。他只想坐在这里，不要被任何人打扰，就这样坐上好久好久，直到沉沉睡去，再也不要再有任何思想、任何感觉。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“怎么回事？”他更加急切地问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was a soft rush of wings. Fawkes the phoenix had left his perch, flown across the office, and landed on Harry's knee.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一阵翅膀轻轻扑打的声音。凤凰福克斯离开了它栖息的枝头，从办公室那头飞过来，落在哈利的膝盖上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dumbledore stopped talking. He sat down opposite Harry, behind his desk. He was looking at Harry, who avoided his eyes. Dumbledore was going to question him. He was going to make Harry relive everything.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="邓布利多停住了话头。他在哈利对面办公桌后面坐了下来。他望着哈利，但哈利躲避着他的目光。邓布利多要向他发问了。他要强迫哈利回忆那所有的一切了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The phoenix let out one soft, quavering note. It shivered in the air, and Harry felt as though a drop of hot liquid had slipped down his throat into his stomach, warming him, and strengthening him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凤凰发出一声轻柔而颤抖的鸣叫。它在空中微微发抖，哈利感到似乎一滴滚热的液体顺着喉咙滑进胃里，使他一下子觉得暖乎乎的，有了力量和勇气。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry felt a rush of gratitude toward Sirius, but Dumbledore took no notice of Sirius's words. He leaned forward toward Harry. Very unwillingly, Harry raised his head and looked into those blue eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利心头涌起对小天狼星的感激之情，但邓布利多仿佛没听见小天狼星的话。他朝哈利探过身子。哈利很不情愿地抬起头，注视着那双蓝色的眼睛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"If I thought I could help you," Dumbledore said gently, "by putting you into an enchanted sleep and allowing you to postpone the moment when you would have to think about what has happened tonight, I would do it. But I know better. Numbing the pain for a while will make it worse when you finally feel it. You have shown bravery beyond anything I could have expected of you. I ask you to demonstrate your courage one more time. I ask you to tell us what happened."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“如果我认为，”邓布利多温和地说，“用催眠的方法使你入睡，允许你暂时不去考虑今晚发生的一切，这样对你有好处，我会这样做的。但是我比你更清楚，暂时使疼痛变得麻木，只会使你最后感觉疼痛时疼得更厉害。你表现出的勇敢无畏，大大超出了我对你的期望。我要求你再一次表现出你的勇气。我要求你把所发生的一切告诉我们。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He took a deep breath and began to tell them. As he spoke, visions of everything that had passed that night seemed to rise before his eyes; he saw the sparkling surface of the potion that had revived Voldemort; he saw the Death Eaters Apparating between the graves around them; he saw Cedric's body, lying on the ground beside the cup.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他深深吸了口气，开始向他们叙述。当他说话时，那天晚上发生的一切都像放电影一样，在他眼前一幕幕闪现；他看见了那使伏地魔起死回生、表面冒着火星的魔药；他看见了食死徒们幻影显形，突然出现在他们周围的坟墓间；他看见了塞德里克的尸体，静静地躺在三强杯旁的地面上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"He said my blood would make him stronger than if he'd used someone else's," Harry told Dumbledore. "He said the protection my -- my mother left in me -- he'd have it too. And he was right -- he could touch me without hurting himself, he touched my face."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他说，用我的血比用其他人的血更管用，会使他更加强壮。”哈利对邓布利多说，“他说那种保护力量——我母亲留在我身体里的那种力量——他也想拥有。他是对的——后来他再碰到我的时候，他就不会受伤了。他碰了我的脸。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Once or twice, Sirius made a noise as though about to say something, his hand still tight on Harry's shoulder, but Dumbledore raised his hand to stop him, and Harry was glad of this, because it was easier to keep going now he had started. It was even a relief; he felt almost as though something poisonous were being extracted from him. It was costing him every bit of determination he had to keep talking, yet he sensed that once he had finished, he would feel better.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有一两次，小天狼星发出一点儿声音，似乎想说此什么，他的手仍然紧紧地抓住哈利的肩膀，但邓布利多举起一只手，阻止了他。这使哈利感到庆幸，因为万事开头难，现在既然打开了话匣子，再说下去就容易多了。他甚至有一种如释重负的感觉，似乎某种有毒的东西正从他体内一点点地被吸走。他以极大的毅力支撑着自己往下说，但他感觉到，一旦他说完了，心头就会舒坦多了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When Harry told of Wormtail piercing his arm with the dagger, however, Sirius let out a vehement exclamation and Dumbledore stood up so quickly that Harry started. Dumbledore walked around the desk and told Harry to stretch out his arm. Harry showed them both the place where his robes were torn and the cut beneath them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当哈利讲到虫尾巴用匕首刺中他的手臂时，小天狼星发出一声激动的喊叫，邓布利多猛地站起身，速度之快，把哈利吓了一跳。邓布利多绕过桌子，叫哈利伸出手臂。哈利给他们俩看了他被撕破的长袍和长袍下面的伤口。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For a fleeting instant, Harry thought he saw a gleam of something like triumph in Dumbledore's eyes. But next second. Harry was sure he had imagined it, for when Dumbledore had returned to his seat behind the desk, he looked as old and weary as Harry had ever seen him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在短短的一瞬间，哈利似乎看见邓布利多眼睛里闪过一丝喜悦的光芒。但哈利很快就认定准是自己看花了眼，因为邓布利多回到办公桌后的椅子上时，看上去又和哈利一向看见的那样苍老和疲倦了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry went on; he explained how Voldemort had emerged from the cauldron, and told them all he could remember of Voldemort's speech to the Death Eaters. Then he told how Voldemort had untied him, returned his wand to him, and prepared to duel.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利继续往下说；他讲述伏地魔怎样从坩埚里浮现出来，并把他记得的伏地魔对食死徒们的讲话告诉了他们。然后他告诉他们伏地魔怎样解开他身上的绳子，把他的魔杖还给他，准备与他决斗。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“非常正确，”邓布利多说，“哈利的魔杖和伏地魔的魔杖有着同样的杖芯。它们各自所含的那根羽毛是同一只凤凰身上取得的。说实话，就是这只凤凰。”他说，指了指静静栖在哈利膝头的金红色的大鸟。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“它们不会正常地攻击对方，”邓布利多说，“不过，如果魔杖的主人硬要两根魔杖争斗…就会出现一种十分罕见的现象。一根魔杖会强迫另一根魔杖重复它施过的魔咒——以倒叙的方式。首先是最近的魔咒…然后是以前的…”">查看中文翻译</div>

When he touched the Mark of any Death Eater, we were to Disapparate, and Apparate, instantly, at his side. This Mark has been growing clearer all year. Karkaroff's too. Why do you think Karkaroff fled tonight? We both felt the Mark burn. We both knew he had returned. Karkaroff fears the Dark Lord's vengeance.
