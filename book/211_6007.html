<div class="line_en">The haggling business, which had mainly depended on the horse, became disorganized forthwith. Distress, if not penury, loomed in the distance. Durbeyfield was what was locally called a slack-twisted fellow; he had good strength to work at times; but the times could not be relied on to coincide with the hours of requirement; and, having been unaccustomed to the regular toil of the day labourer, he was not particularly persistent when they did so coincide.</div>

<div class="line_en">Tess Durbeyfield's route on this memorable morning lay amid the northeastern undulations of the Vale in which she had been born, and in which her life had unfolded. The Vale of Blackmoor was to her the world, and its inhabitants the races thereof. From the gates and stiles of Marlott she had looked down its length in the wondering days of infancy, and what had been mystery to her then was not much less than mystery to her now. She has seen dally from her chamber-window towers, villages, faint white mansions; above all the town of Shaston standing majestically on its height; its windows shining like lamps in the evening sun. She had hardly ever visited the place, only a small tract even of the Vale and its environs being known to her by close inspection. Much less had she been far outside the valley. Every contour of the surrounding hills was as personal to her as that of her relatives' faces; but for what lay beyond her judgment was dependent on the teaching of the village school, where she had held a leading place at the time of her leaving, a year or two before this date.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在这个难忘的早上，苔丝·德北菲尔德要走的路是从布莱克原野谷东北部高低起伏的中间地带穿过，她在这个谷中出生，她的人生也是在这个谷中展开的。对苔丝来说，黑荒原谷就是一个世界，因此黑荒原谷的所有居民就是整个人类。在她对一切都感到新奇的孩童时期，她就从马洛特村的栅栏门口和栅栏门旁的台阶上向下仔细地观察过这片谷地，那时候她感到很神秘，而现在她感到的神秘也没有减少多少。每天她都从自己房间的窗户里看见教堂的钟楼、村庄和白色的屋宇；尤其是高踞山顶的威严的沙斯顿小镇特别惹人注意；小镇的窗玻璃在夕阳里闪闪发光，宛如一盏盏灯火。她从来没有去过那个地方，即使这个山谷和这个山谷附近的地带，她通过就近观察而熟悉的地方只有一小片。远离山谷的地方她就去得更少了。四周山峦的所有外形她都熟悉，就像熟悉她的亲戚的面孔一样；但是对她没有去过的地方，她就只能根据在乡村小学学到的知识加以判断了。到今天她离开学校还只有一两年的时间，她离开学校的时候，她是学校里学得最好的学生。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As Tess grew older, and began to see how matters stood, she felt quite a Malthusian towards her mother for thoughtlessly giving her so many little sisters and brothers, when it was such a trouble to nurse and provide for them. Her mother's intelligence was that of a happy child: Joan Durbeyfield was simply an additional one, and that not the eldest, to her own long family of waiters on Providence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="苔丝渐渐地长大了，开始懂事了，这时候，她感到自己就像是一个马尔萨斯的门徒，来看待她母亲糊里糊涂地给她生下的一群弟弟妹妹了，因为养育他们、照顾他们是一件十分麻烦的事。她母亲的智力只是一个快活小孩子的智力。对她自己家里一大群听天由命的孩子来说，琼·德北菲尔德简直就是其中的一个，而且还不是最大的一个。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In those early days she had been much loved by others of her own sex and age, and had used to be seen about the village as one of three -- all nearly of the same year -- walking home from school side by side; Tess the middle one -- in a pink print pinafore, of a finely reticulated pattern, worn over a stuff frock that had lost its original colour for a nondescript tertiary -- marching on upon long stalky legs, in tight stockings which had little ladder-like holes at the knees, torn by kneeling in the roads and banks in search of vegetable and mineral treasures; her then earth-coloured hair hanging like pot-hooks; the arms of the two outside girls resting round the waist of Tess; her arms on the shoulders of the two supporters.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在她上学的日子里，和她同龄的女孩子都很喜欢她，在村子里可以经常看到她们三个女孩子走在一起——她们的年龄几乎一样大小——放了学肩并肩地从学校回家。苔丝走在中间，穿一件毛料连衣裙，连衣裙原先的颜色已经褪掉了，变成了一种无法形容的模糊颜色；连衣裙外面穿一件粉红色的印花连胸围裙，上面有精致的网状花纹；她迈开两条细长的腿走路，腿上穿着紧身长袜，膝盖部分尽是一些抽丝小洞，那是她跪在路上和草坡上寻找植物和矿物中的宝贝撕破的；那时候她的头发是土灰色的，披在头上像挂锅的钩子；她两边的女孩子用手搂着苔丝的腰；苔丝的两条胳膊就搭在两个女孩子的肩膀上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She alighted from the van at Trantridge Cross, and ascended on foot a hill in the direction of the district known as The Chase, on the borders of which, as she had been informed, Mrs d'Urberville's seat, The Slopes, would be found. It was not a manorial home in the ordinary sense, with fields, and pastures, and a grumbling farmer, out of whom the owner had to squeeze an income for himself and his family by hook or by crook. It was more, far more; a country house built for enjoyment pure and simple, with not an acre of troublesome land attached to it beyond what was required for residential purposes, and for a little fancy farm kept in hand by the owner, and tended by a bailiff.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她在特兰里奇的十字路口下了车，步行上山，向那个叫做猎苑的地方走去；她已经听人说过，在猪苑边上的平坦地上就能找到德贝维尔的居处。它不是一座普通意义上的庄园，没有田地，没有牧场，也没有让庄园主为了自己和家庭的日常开销而从他们身上把油水挤出来的牢骚满腹的农工。它不是那种庄园，而且远不是那种庄园能够相比的；它完全是一座纯粹为了享乐而建的一幢乡村别墅，除了建筑别墅所需要的土地和一小块由庄园主经管、由管家照看的养鸟的农田外，就再也没有一亩添麻烦的田地同它连在一起了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Every day seemed to throw upon her young shoulders more of the family burdens, and that Tess should be the representative of the Durbeyfields at the d'Urberville mansion came as a thing of course.

<div class="line_cn" title="她年轻的肩上担负的家庭重担，似乎一大大加重了，因此她应该作为德北菲尔德家的代表去德贝维尔的府上，也就成了一件理所当然的事。我们必须承认，在这种情形下，到那儿去的苔丝就是德北菲尔德家向外显露的最好的一面。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">However, Tess became humanely beneficent towards the small ones, and to help them as much as possible she used, as soon as she left school, to lend a hand at hay making or harvesting on neighbouring farms; or, by preference, at milking or butter-making processes, which she had learnt when her father had owned cows; and being deft-fingered it was a kind of work in which she excelled.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，苔丝对她的弟弟和妹妹却很疼爱、呵护，并尽力帮助他们，一放学回家，她就到附近的农田里割草、收庄稼，做一个帮手；或者去帮着做她喜欢做的事情，如挤牛奶、搅奶油，这是她从前在父亲养牛时学会的；因为她的手指头灵活，所以这种活儿她干得比成人还好。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The crimson brick lodge came first in sight, up to its eaves in dense evergreens. Tess thought this was the mansion itself till, passing through the side wicket with some trepidation, and onward to a point at which the drive took a turn, the house proper stood in full view. It was of recent erection -- indeed almost new -- and of the same rich red colour that formed such a contrast with the evergreens of the lodge. Far behind the corner of the house -- which rose like a geranium bloom against the subdued colours around -- stretched the soft azure landscape of The Chase -- a truly venerable tract of forest land, one of the few remaining woodlands in England of undoubted primaeval date, wherein Druidical mistletoe was still found on aged oaks, and where enormous yew trees, not planted by the hand of man, grew as they had grown when they were pollarded for bows. All this sylvan antiquity, however, though visible from the Slopes, was outside the immediate boundaries of the estate.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="苔丝最先看见的是用红砖盖成的门房，然后才看见屋檐上长满的厚厚的长青藤蔓。苔丝以为这就是庄园本身；她怀着惶恐不安的心情走过偏门，走到车路转弯的地点，这时候，她才看见出现在眼前的庄园全貌。庄园是最近新盖的——几乎全是新的——它也是同样的深红颜色，同偏门长满的长青藤蔓形成鲜明对照。在周围浅谈柔和的颜色的对照下，它就像一簇天竺葵的红花突现在那儿；在屋角后面的远处，展现在眼前的是猎苑的一大片柔和的淡蓝色风景——的确是一片让人肃然起敬的森林，是英国残留下来的已经不多的原始森林中的一片；在古老的橡树上，仍然还找得到朱伊德槲寄生，林中的茂密的水杉树不是人工栽种的，它们从人们把它们的枝条砍下来做弓箭的时候就生长在那里。但是，所有这些古老的森林，虽然从山坡上可以看见，但是却已经超越这片产业的边界了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Everything on this snug property was bright, thriving, and well kept; acres of glass houses stretched down the inclines to the copses at their feet. Everything looked like money -- like the last coin issued from the Mint. The stables, partly screened by Austrian pines and evergreen oaks, and fitted with every late appliance, were as dignified as Chapels-of-Ease. On the extensive lawn stood an ornamental tent, its door being towards her.</div>

<div class="line_en">When old Mr Simon Stoke, latterly deceased, had made his fortune as an honest merchant (some said money-lender) in the North, he decided to settle as a county man in the South of England, out of hall of his business district; and in doing this he felt the necessity of recommencing with a name that would not too readily identify him with the smart tradesman of the past, and that would be less commonplace than the original bald stark words. Conning for an hour in the British Museum the pages of works devoted to extinct, half extinct, obscured, and ruined families appertaining to the quarter of England in which he proposed to settle, he considered that d'Urberville looked and sounded as well as any of them: and d'Urberville accordingly was annexed to his own name for himself and his heirs eternally. Yet he was not an extravagant minded man in this, and in constructing his family tree on the new basis was duly reasonable in framing his inter-marriages and aristocratic links, never inserting a single title above a rank of strict moderation.</div>

<div class="line_en">He watched her pretty and unconscious munching through the skeins of smoke that pervaded the tent, and Tess Durbeyfield did not divine, as she innocently looked down at the roses in her bosom, that there behind the blue narcotic haze was potentially the 'tragic mischief' of her drama one who stood fair to be the blood-red-ray in the spectrum of her young life. She had an attribute which amounted to a disadvantage just now; and it was attribute which amounted to a disadvantage just now; and it was this that caused Alec d'Urberville's eyes to rivet themselves upon her. It was a luxuriance of aspect, a fullness of growth, which made her appear more of a woman that she really was. She had inherited the feature from her mother without the quality it denoted. It had troubled her mind occasionally, till her companions had said that it was a fault which time would cure.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the ill-judged execution of the well-judged plan of things the call seldom produces the comer, the man to love rarely coincides with the hour for loving. Nature does not often say 'See!' to her poor creature at a time when seeing can lead to happy doing; or reply 'Here!'to a body's cry of 'Where?'till the hide and seek has become an irksome, outworn game. We may wonder whether at the acme and summit of the human progress these anachronisms will be corrected by a finer intuition, a closer interaction of the social machinery than that which now jolts us round and along; but such completeness is not to be prophesied, or even conceived as possible. Enough that in the present case, as in millions, it was not the two halves of a perfect whole that confronted each other at the perfect moment; a missing counterpart wandered independently about the earth waiting in crass obtuseness till the late time came. Out of which maladroit delay sprang anxieties, disappointments, shocks, catastrophes, and passing-strange destinies.</div>
