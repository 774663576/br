<div class="line_en">Alex and his aide-de-camp, who is the son of Lord Templemore, have left us after staying two nights. I hope Alex will come back again next weekend. He certainly enjoyed himself painting, and produced a very good picture considering it is the first time that he has handled a brush for six years. I have now four pictures, three of them large, in an advanced state, and I honestly think they are better than any I have painted so far. I gave Alex your message and he was very pleased.</div>

<div class="line_en">The painting has been a great pleasure to me, and I have really forgotten all my vexations. It is a wonderful cure, because you really cannot think of anything else. This is Saturday, and it is a week since we started. We have had newspapers up till Wednesday. I have skimmed through them, and it certainly seems we are going to have a pretty hard time. I cannot feel the Government is doing enough about demobilization, still less about getting our trade on the move again. I do not know how we are ever to pay our debts, and it is even difficult to see how we shall pay our way. Even if we were all united in a Coalition, gathering all the strength of the nation, our task might well is beyond our powers. However, all this seems already quite remote from me on this lovely lake, where nearly all the days are full of sunshine and the weather bright and cool.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对于我来说，作画是一件非常令人高兴的事。作画时，我的一切烦恼都会被抛到九霄云外。作画真不愧为一个奇妙的疗法，因为此时的人们根本不会有其他杂念。今天是周六，我们出发至今已有一个星期了，可直到星期三我们才收到报纸。我粗略浏览了一下，看来我们真的将经历一段艰难的日子。我觉得政府在裁军方面的工作做得并不够，此外在重新促进贸易发展方面的工作也做得很少。我不知道我们怎样才能偿还债务；至于怎样才可不举债则更加有难度。即使我们全部团结在一起，组成一个联邦，集中起全国的所有力量，我们所面临的这个任务也是超出我们能力范围的，心有余而力不足。不过，这一切似乎已经离我很遥远，在这片美丽的湖上，几乎每天伴随我的都是明媚的阳光和凉爽宜人的气候。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Much better than the newspapers was your letter, with its amusing but rather macabre account of the journey to Wood Ford. I am longing to hear how our affairs are progressing. I do hope you are not overtaxing yourself with all the business that there is to do. We shall certainly not forget about Mary's birthday, but let me know what you have done about a present.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="你的来信里讲述的关于伍德福德既有趣又惊险的旅行故事可比报纸好看多了。我想听你讲讲我们的事情进展得如何。我真心希望你不要因为那些要做的事而让自己负担过重。我们当然不会忘记玛丽的生日；但是，请告诉我你准备了什么礼物呀。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Considering how pleasant and delightful the days have been, I cannot say they have passed quickly. It seems quite a long time since I arrived, although every day has been full of interest and occupation. I have converted my enormous bathroom into a studio with makeshift easels, and there all this morning Alex and I tried to put the finishing touches on our pictures of yesterday. He has set his heart on buying a villa here on a promontory. I have not seen it inside, but from the outside it looks the most beautiful abode one can possibly imagine, and I understand that inside it is even more romantic, going back to the fifteenth century. He was a little startled when I pointed out to him that no one will be allowed to buy a foreign property across the exchange perhaps for many years.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就这些日子而言，真的令人非常惬意，但是我感觉时间还是过得很慢。尽管这里的每一天都充满乐趣，我过得也很充实，但是却依然感到来到这里似乎很长一段时间了。我把我的那间大浴室改装成了一个工作室，里面还摆着临时画架。今天整一上午亚历克斯和我都呆在那儿，努力完成昨天的画。亚历克斯下定决心要买下这儿的一幢海角别墅。我没有看过里面的陈设，但从外面看起来它确实是人们所能想象得出的最漂亮的住宅了。我知道室内甚至要更加浪漫，若是置身其中仿佛回到15世纪。但是，当我告诉他这里可能多年来一直不允许交易购买外国地产时，他颇感惊讶。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He begged me to stay on here as long as I like, but I think I shall come back the 18th or 19th. I am doubtful whether I shall stop in Paris. I expect in another ten or eleven days I shall be very keen to get home again. Sarah has been a great joy, and gets on with everybody. She and I both drive the speed-boats. They are a wonderful way of getting about this lake, and far safer than the awful winding roads around which the Italians career with motorcars and Lorries at all sorts of speeds and angles.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="亚历克斯请求我继续待在这里，想留多久就留多久。但我想18或19号就回去。我还在犹豫途中是否在巴黎停留，但我多么希望再过10天或11天之后能回到我渴望已久的家。萨拉是我们的开心果，她和大家相处得很好。我们俩驾着快艇驰骋于湖上，感觉妙极了，而且比起意大利职业赛车手在连续弯路上全方位、全速驾驶小汽车或卡车可是安全得多。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">My Darling I think a great deal of you and last night when I was driving the speed-boat back there came into my mind your singing to me "In the Gloaming" years ago. What a sweet song and tune and how beautifully you sang it in all its pathos. My heart thrills and I love to feel you near me in thought. I feel so tenderly towards you my darling and the more pleasant and agreeable the scenes and days, the more I wish you were here to share them and give me a kiss.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="亲爱的，我对你是日思夜想。昨晚我驾着快艇返航时，我脑子里回想起你多年以前对我唱的一首歌，歌名叫做《在黄昏》。多么动听的歌曲！多么美妙的曲调！而且你唱得又是如此地哀婉动人！我的心在震颤，我打从心里喜欢你在我身边的感觉。亲爱的，我对你感到多么温柔啊！这里的风光愈是赏心悦目，日子愈是舒适惬意，我就愈发强烈地渴望你能来到我身边与我分享这一切，并给我一个吻。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Miss Layton has heard from her 'boy-friend' in S. Africa that she is to go out there (not Canada) immediately if possible to marry him. So she is very happy. Yesterday the South African officers came from their hotel and took her out to 'water-plane' behind their speed boat. She looked very handsome whirling along in the water and made three large circles in front of the villa before she tumbled in. Sarah is writing you now. The DB is starting.</div>
