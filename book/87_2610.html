<div class="line_en">Jill was deeply relieved to hear the sound of Wesker's voice as she jogged toward the open door of the S. T. A. R. S. office. She'd seen one of their helicopters taking off as she'd arrived, and been positive that they'd left without her. The S. T. A. R. S. were a fairly casual outfit in some respects. But there also wasn't any room for people who couldn't keep up-and she wanted very much to be in on this case from the beginning.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔一路小跑，奔向S.T。A.R。S敞开着的办公室的门，当她听到威斯克的声音后才感到安心。因为她刚到达这幢建筑物时，看到了一架直升机刚刚离开，吉尔还以为上面是自己的队友们。S.T。A.R。S从某种意义上讲是一支快速反应部队，的确不适合那些什么事情都跟不上的人。所以吉尔在心里暗暗盘算着，在这次的案件中自己一定要从头参与。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At least she wasn't too late; Wesker always ran meetings the same way-update speech, theory, then Q and A. Jill took a deep breath and stepped into the office. Wesker was pointing to a posted map at the front of the room, dotted with colored tags where the bodies had been found. He hardly faltered in his speech as she walked quickly to her desk, feeling suddenly like she was back in basic training and had shown up late for class.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="至少吉尔还不算是迟到得特别严重，威斯克还在以和之前的作战会议相同的顺序进行着——最新的情报、简介，接着是对疑问的应答。吉尔深深地吸了口气，然后走进办公室。威斯克正站在办公室的前面，在一张标有遇害者尸体被发现场所记号的地图上比划着。虽然吉尔快步走向自己的桌子，但威斯克的话却并没有中断。不经意间，吉尔感觉自己好像回到了基础训练时期，在课堂上迟到的情形大概和这差不多。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Chris frowned, but said nothing more. Jill resisted the urge to roll her eyes at Wesker's little speech. He was doing the right thing, technically, but had left out the part about it being politic to do as Chief Irons wanted. Irons had made it clear time and again throughout the killing spree that he was in charge of the investigation and was calling the shots. It wouldn't have bothered her so much except that Wesker presented himself as an independent thinker, a man who didn't play politics. She had joined the S. T. A. R. S. because she couldn't stand the bullshit red-tape that dominated so much of law enforcement, and Wesker's obvious deferral to the chief was irritating.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克里斯虽然皱着眉头，但是却并没有再继续说下去。面对威斯克的这些回答，吉尔也在压抑着想要顶撞的冲动。他说的这些事情都很正确，至少在理论上是这样的。但是正如艾隆斯署长所希望的那样，其中还潜藏着政治性的因素。艾隆斯在这一系列事件发生之时就再三明确了自己才是指挥这次搜查行动的负责人。吉尔对这种事情并不在意，只不过对于声称按照自己的想法行动，自己并不是政治家的威斯克的欺骗性举动则另当别论。吉尔加入S.T。A.R。S之后，从来不将那些警察当局内部的官僚主义放在眼里，所以根本没有威斯克对署长的那种明显的顾虑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She looked back up at Wesker and made her pitch. "My theory at this point is that there's a possible ritualistic cult hiding in the mountains, four to eleven members strong, with guard dogs trained to attack intruders in their territory."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔说完抬起头看着威斯克，提高嗓门说道，“目前我的见解是这样的：我认为有一些狂热的宗教分子潜伏在森林地带进行某种可怕的宗教仪式。人员大概四到七名。另外还有一只受过专门训练的狗，他会对入侵这片区域的人展开攻击。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Uh, the tissue samples from underneath both Becky McGee's and Chris Smith's fingernails were an exact match, we got that yesterday… and Tonya Lipton, the third victim, had definitely been hiking in the foothills, that'd be sector-seven-B…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“呃，从贝琪·玛吉和克里斯·史密斯的指甲中所采集到的细胞组织样本，经过化验之后证明二者是一致的。我是昨天拿到这份报告的，另外，第三个受害者托尼亚·瑞普顿在遇害时一定是在山脚下散步…而那个地区是7—B。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She looked down at the notes she had on the stack of files in front of her, scanning them for reference.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="说着，她的目光落在堆积如山的资料中的备忘录上，一边参照资料一边翻动文件。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Extrapolate." Wesker folded his arms, waiting.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“谈一下你得出此结论的证据吧。”威斯克抱着胳膊说道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At least no one had laughed. Jill plunged forward, warming to the material. "The cannibalism and dis-memberment suggest ritualistic behavior, as does the presence of decomposed flesh found on some of the victims -- like the killers are carrying parts of previ-ous unknown victims to their attacks. We've got saliva and tissue samples from four separate human assail-ants, though eye-witness reports suggest up to ten or eleven people. And those killed by animals were all found or found to be attacked in the same vicinity, suggesting that they wandered into some kind of off-limits area. The saliva traces appear to be canine, though there's still some disagreement…" She trailed off, finished.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="至少没有人感到可笑。这让吉尔对自己的这套理论更加认同，于是接着说道：“我认为吃人以及切断四肢的行为是某种仪式的行为。从受害者的体内附有腐烂的肉块这一点来看，我觉得这些人好像拿着之前杀害的人的某部分肢体四处走。我们目前得到了四个不同的施害者的唾液以及细胞组织，但是根据目击者的证言来看，对方最多是十个人或者十一个人的集团。另外，被野兽杀害的人们虽然是在附近周边地区被发现的，可是这应该是有种警告的意味，在暗示其他人不要靠近。虽然从唾液上来看应该是属于狗等生物的，但是关于这一点，大家的意见还没有统一…”吉尔的声音渐渐变弱，最后沉默了下来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Wesker scooped up a pen and walked to the dry-erase board next to his desk, talking as he moved. "I agree." He wrote territoriality on the board and then turned back to face her. "Anything else?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我有同感。”威斯克拿起笔走到放在自己桌前的白板旁，在白板上写下“领土权”三个字，然后看着吉尔说：“还有其他事情吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jill sighed. She hated having to shoot her own theory down, but that was part of the job-and in all honesty, the part that most encouraged clear, rational thinking. The S. T. A. R. S. trained their people not to fixate on any single path to the truth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔叹了口气，虽然她并不想用自己的理论来推翻刚才自己提出的论点，可这依然是她的职责所在——说出全部事实，然后促进大家清晰而又合理地思考。S.T。A.R。S所训练出来的成员都知道，通往真相的道路往往不只有一条。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Joseph Frost, the Alpha vehicle specialist, piped up from the back of the room. "The animal attack part works, though, protecting their territory and all that."</div>

<div class="line_en">She glanced at her notes again. "It's highly unlikely that a cult that big would move around much, and the murders started too recently to be local; the RPD would've seen signs before now, some escalation to this kind of behavior. Also, the level of post-mortem violence indicates disorganized offenders, and they usually work solo."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔再一次翻开备忘录：“我们进行过大规模调查，在目前有备案的案件中像这次如此残暴的，之前并没有先例。而且所有的案件在发生之前，警察总会调查出一些征兆，可这种行为却是呈阶段性增加。另外，在受害者死后对尸体施加的暴力一般都代表着头脑有问题的罪犯所为。但是这样的人基本上都单独行动。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Wesker turned his attention to Brad Vickers, who suggested that it was a new strain of terrorism, and that demands would be made soon. Wesker put terrorism on the board, but didn't seem enthusiastic about the idea. Neither did anyone else. Brad quickly went back to his headset, checking on Bravo team's status.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="威斯克将注意力转向克里斯，他对这些行径有了新的想法，并急于表达出来，于是在白板上写下“恐怖主义”几个字，但内心中却并没有真正认同这一看法。其他人也是如此。布拉德随即又戴上了耳机，开始确认Bravo小队的情况。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jill shook her head, but felt good that she'd contributed something. She knew the cult aspect was reaching, but it had been all she could come up with. The police certainly hadn't come up with anything better.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔摇了摇头，他觉得虽然自己的见解是在适用范围之内，可是那些终究只不过是些猜测。但尽管如此，警察方面也绝不会得出比着些猜测更加高明的见解了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Both Joseph and Barry passed on theorizing, and Chris's views on the killings were already well known, if vague; he believed that there was an organized assault going on, and that external influences were involved somehow. Wesker asked if he had anything new to add (stressing new, Jill noticed), and Chris shook his head, looking depressed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="约瑟夫与巴瑞在一旁默默思考着，关于克里斯对杀人案件的见解，大家已经都知道了，他相信这些有组织的袭击活动肯定与其他外部的力量有所关联。而威斯克也向克里斯询问是否要为这一想法添加一些新的见解，而后者只是默默地摇了摇头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Wesker capped the black pen and sat on the edge of his desk, gazing thoughtfully at the blank expanse of board. "It's a start," he said. "I know you've all read the police and coroner reports, and listened to the eyewitness accounts."</div>

<div class="line_en">Wesker opened the door at the end of the hall and stepped out into the bright evening, the rising hum of the 'copter's engine and the smell of machine oil filling his senses. The small rooftop helipad was cooler than inside, partly draped by the shadow of an aging water tower, and empty except for the gunmetal gray Alpha helicopter. For the first time, he wondered what had gone wrong for Bravo; he'd had Joseph and the rookie check both birds out yesterday and they'd been fine, all systems go.</div>

<div class="line_en">He stepped up to the open pilot door and got a shaky thumbs-up from Vickers; the man looked positively green, and Wesker briefly considered leaving him behind. Chris was licensed to fly, and Vickers had a reputation for choking under the gun; the last thing he needed was for one of his people to freeze up if there was trouble. Then he thought about the lost Bravos and decided against it. This was a rescue mission. The worst Vickers could do would be to throw up on himself if the 'copter had crashed badly, and Wesker could live with that.</div>

<div class="line_en">Unfortunately for all of them, he was an idiot with a little bit of power. Wesker had checked him out carefully before taking the position in Raccoon City, and knew a few things about the chief that didn't paint him in a particularly positive light. He had no intention of using that information, but if Irons attempted to screw things up one more time, Wesker had no qualms about letting that information get out… or at least telling him that I have access to it; it'd certainly keep him out of the way.</div>

<div class="line_en">As the three of them stored the equipment, Wesker turned his attention back to the door, watching for Jill. He checked his watch and frowned. It had been just under five minutes since their last contact with Bravo, they'd made excellent time… so where the hell was Valentine? He hadn't interacted with her much since she'd come to Raccoon, but her file was a rave review. She'd gotten high recommendations from everyone she'd worked with, praised by her last captain as highly intelligent and "unusually" calm in a crisis. She'd have to be, with her history. Her father was Dick Valentine, the best thief in the business a couple of decades back.
