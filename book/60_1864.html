<meta content="她的举止越来越粗鲁，越来越不近情理。两年前她发现了他的不忠，从此每况愈下。没有任何出路。但还能谈什么乐趣吗？他刚刚出门去同某个情人幽会，便马上对她感到厌恶，发誓这是最后一次见她。怎么回事！难道他就不能断绝那些性友谊吗？不能。不然定会使他撕心裂肺。他无法控制对女人的占有欲。再说，他觉得这样做也毫无用处。他这些艳遇对特蕾莎没有任何威胁，这一点他比任何人都心知肚明。他为什么非要断掉呢？这无异于放弃看一场足球赛，这样做让他觉得十分荒唐可笑。" name="description">

<div class="line_en">Her gestures grew abrupt and unsteady. Two years had elapsed since she discovered he was unfaithful, and things had grown worse. There was no way out.</div>

<div class="line_en">But was it still a matter of pleasure? Even as he set out to visit another woman, he found her distasteful and promised himself he would not see her again.</div>

<div class="line_en">Was he genuinely incapable of abandoning his erotic friendships? He was. It would have torn him apart. He lacked the strength to control his taste for other women. Besides, he failed to see the need. No one knew better than he how little his exploits threatened Tereza. Why then give them up? He saw no more reason for that than to deny himself soccer matches.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="怎么回事！难道他就不能断绝那些性友谊吗？不能。不然定会使他撕心裂肺。他无法控制对女人的占有欲。再说，他觉得这样做也毫无用处。他这些艳遇对特蕾莎没有任何威胁，这一点他比任何人都心知肚明。他为什么非要断掉呢？这无异于放弃看一场足球赛，这样做让他觉得十分荒唐可笑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He constantly had Tereza's image before his eyes, and the only way he could erase it was by quickly getting drunk. Ever since meeting Tereza, he had been unable to make love to other women without alcohol! But alcohol on his breath was a sure sign to Tereza of infidelity.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他眼前呈现的是特蕾莎的形象，他必须立即麻醉自己才能不再想她。从他认识她起，他不醉酒便无法同别的女人上床！然而，恰恰是他醉酒呼出的气味让特蕾莎更轻易地发现他不忠诚的蛛丝马迹。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was caught in a trap: even on his way to see them, he found them distasteful, but one day without them and he was back on the phone, eager to make contact.</div>

<div class="line_en">Afterwards, still naked and lazily walking across the studio, she stopped before an easel with a half-finished painting and watched him sidelong as he threw on his clothes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="完事后，她没精打采，光着身子在画室里走，然后站在床头尚未完成的一幅油画前，朝托马斯瞥了一眼，发现他在急匆匆地穿衣服。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Perhaps he himself did not realize how much he had changed: he was now afraid to come home late, because Tereza would be waiting up for him. Then one day Sabina caught him glancing at his watch during intercourse and trying to hasten its conclusion.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他可能根本没有意识到自己的变化有多大：他害怕太晚回家，因为特蕾莎在等着他。一次，萨比娜发现他做爱时偷偷看表，明显想尽快草率完事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When he was fully dressed except for one bare foot, he looked around the room, and then got down on all fours to continue the search under a table.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他很快穿好了衣服，但一只脚还光着。他查看周围，然后四肢趴在地上，在桌子下面寻找什么东西。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He still felt most comfortable with Sabina. He knew she was discreet and would not divulge their rendezvous. Her studio greeted him like a memento of his past, his idyllic bachelor past.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="还是在萨比娜那里，他的感觉最好，因为他很清楚她不会声张，他不用担心被人发现。画室里，仿佛浮现着他往昔生活的记忆，那是他牧歌般美妙的单身汉日子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">You seem to be turning into the theme of all my paintings, she said. The meeting of two worlds. A double exposure. Showing through the outline of Tomas the libertine, incredibly, the face of a romantic lover. Or, the other way, through a Tristan, always thinking of his Tereza, I see the beautiful, betrayed world of the libertine.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她说：“当我看着你，我感觉到你同我油画中的永久主题渐渐融为了一体。两种世界的相遇。双重的展示。在放荡的托马斯的身影后，一张浪漫情人的面孔隐约可见，令人无法置信。或者反过来说吧，在一心只想着他的特蕾莎的特里斯丹的身影下，居然可以看到放荡之徒所表现出的美妙世界。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It's not out of the question. You've been very absentminded lately. Always rushing somewhere, looking at your watch. It wouldn't surprise me in the least if you forgot to put on a sock.</div>

<div class="line_en">He knew very well she was getting back at him for glancing at his watch while making love to her. She had hidden his sock somewhere. It was indeed cold out, and he had no choice but to take her up on the offer. He went home wearing a sock on one foot and a wide-net stocking rolled down over his ankle on the other.</div>
