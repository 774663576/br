<div class="line_en">Mr Bucket was the only person in the family with a job. He worked in a toothpaste factory, where he sat all day long at a bench and screwed the little caps on to the tops of the tubes of toothpaste after the tubes had been filled. But a toothpaste cap-screwer is never paid very much money, and poor Mr Bucket, however hard he worked, and however fast he screwed on the caps, was never able to make enough to buy one half of the things that so large a family needed. There wasn't even enough money to buy proper food for them all. The only meals they could afford were bread and margarine for breakfast, boiled potatoes and cabbage for lunch, and cabbage soup for supper. Sundays were a bit better. They all looked forward to Sundays because then, although they had exactly the same, everyone was allowed a second helping.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Buckets, of course, didn't starve, but every one of them -- the two old grandfathers, the two old grandmothers, Charlie's father, Charlie's mother, and especially little Charlie himself -- went about from morning till night with a horrible empty feeling in their tummies.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当然，巴克特一家人没有饿死，但每一个人——老爷爷和老奶奶、老姥爷和老姥姥、查理的爸爸和查理的妈妈，特别是小查理——从早到晚都有一种肚子空空的感觉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Charlie felt it worst of all. And although his father and mother often went without their own share of lunch or supper so that they could give it to him, it still wasn't nearly enough for a growing boy. He desperately wanted something more filling and satisfying than cabbage and cabbage soup. The one thing he longed for more than anything else was… CHOCOLATE.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最感到肚子空空的是查理。虽然他的爸爸妈妈常常把自己的一份午餐或者晚餐让给他吃，但对一个正在发育的孩子来说，这还是不够的。他需要比卷心菜和卷心菜汤更能充饥和更好吃的东西。他最向往的就是——巧克力糖。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Walking to school in the mornings, Charlie could see great slabs of chocolate piled up high in the shop windows, and he would stop and stare and press his nose against the glass, his mouth watering like mad. Many times a day, he would see other children taking bars of creamy chocolate out of their pockets and munching them greedily, and that, of course, was pure torture.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="查理每天早晨上学，看到商店橱窗里堆得高高的大块大块的巧克力糖就会停下脚步，把鼻子贴着橱窗看，大流口水。一天里有许多次，他眼看着别的孩子从衣袋里掏出一块块奶油巧克力糖，吧嗒吧嗒地大嚼特嚼。不用说，这纯粹是一种折磨。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Only once a year, on his birthday, did Charlie Bucket ever get to taste a bit of chocolate. The whole family saved up their money for that special occasion, and when the great day arrived, Charlie was always presented with one small chocolate bar to eat all by himself. And each time he received it, on those marvellous birthday mornings, he would place it carefully in a small wooden box that he owned, and treasure it as though it were a bar of solid gold; and for the next few days, he would allow himself only to look at it, but never to touch it. Then at last, when he could stand it no longer, he would peel back a tiny bit of the paper wrapping at one corner to expose a tiny bit of chocolate, and then he would take a tiny nibble -- just enough to allow the lovely sweet taste to spread out slowly over his tongue. The next day, he would take another tiny nibble, and so on, and so on. And in this way, Charlie would make his sixpenny bar of birthday chocolate last him for more than a month.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一年当中，只有在过生日那天，查理·巴克特才能尝到一点儿巧克力糖。全家人为了这个特殊的日子，把他们的钱省了下来。等这个重大日子一到，他们总是送给查理一块小小的巧克力糖，全归他一个人吃。每次在美好的生日早晨收到这样一块巧克力糖时，查理总把它小心地放在自己的一个小木盒里，宝贝得像是一根金条。开头几天他只是看着，从来不去碰它，后来实在忍不住了，他才把包糖纸的一角拉开一点点，露出一点点巧克力糖，然后轻轻地咬一点点，只让那可口的甜味足够在舌头上慢慢地散开。第二天他再咬一点点，第三天又咬一点点，一天天这样一点点咬下去。用这个办法，一小块六便士的生日巧克力糖，查理可以吃上一个多月。">查看中文翻译</div>

It was the most terrible torturing thing you could imagine, and it was this:</div>

It was WONKA'S FACTORY, owned by a man called Mr Willy Wonka, the greatest inventor and maker of chocolates that there has ever been. And what a tremendous, marvellous place it was! It had huge iron gates leading into it, and a high wall surrounding it, and smoke belching from its chimneys, and strange whizzing sounds coming from deep inside it. And outside the walls, for half a mile around in every direction, the air was scented with the heavy rich smell of melting chocolate!</div>
