<div class="line_cn" title="“什么感觉怎么样？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Rudy simply continued walking and spoke through the cold air in front of him. Close to Tommy Muller's apartment block, he said, "You know something, Liesel, I was thinking. You're not a thief at all," and he didn't give her a chance to reply. "That woman lets you in. She even leaves you cookies, for Christ's sake. I don't call that stealing. Stealing is what the army does. Taking your father, and mine." He kicked a stone and it clanged against a gate. He walked faster. "All those rich Nazis up there, on Grande Strasse, Gelb Strasse, Heide Strasse."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="鲁迪自顾自地走路，对着前方冰冷的空气说话。走到汤米·穆勒家所在的街区时，他说道：“莉泽尔，你知道我在想什么，你根本就不是贼。”他没给她回答的机会，又说：“明明是那个女人放你进去的。她还给你留了圣诞节的点心，我的天哪。我可不觉得那是偷窃。偷窃是军队做的那些事——他们带走了你爸爸和我爸爸。”他踢起一块石头，石头撞在了一扇大门上。他加快了步伐。“所有的钱都在格兰德街、格尔布街和海德大街那些纳粹分子手里。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Liesel could concentrate on nothing but keeping up. They'd already passed Frau Diller's and were well onto Munich Street. "Rudy --"</div>

<div class="line_en">At that moment, she chose to keep still. If he wanted an answer, he'd have to come back, and he did. "Well?" But again, it was Rudy who answered, before Liesel could even open her mouth. "It feels good, doesn't it? To steal something back."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时，莉泽尔停下了脚步。如果鲁迪想要听到她的回答，他就得回头。“说呀？”不过，莉泽尔根本来不及张嘴，又被鲁迪抢先回答了。“那种感觉好极了，是不是？毕竟可以偷点东西回来。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As they kept walking, Rudy explained the toolbox at length, and what he would do with each item. For example, the hammers were for smashing windows and the towel was to wrap them up, to quell the sound.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们走在路上，鲁迪详细解释了工具箱里的每一件东西和它的用途。比方说，榔头可以用来敲碎窗户，如果拿毛巾包住榔头，就能消除噪音。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"And the teddy bear?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那泰迪熊呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It belonged to Anna-Marie Steiner and was no bigger than one of Liesel's books. The fur was shaggy and worn. The eyes and ears had been sewn back on repeatedly, but it was friendly looking nonetheless.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="它是安娜－玛丽·施泰纳的，跟莉泽尔的书差不多大。这只小熊毛发蓬乱，又破又旧。眼睛和耳朵都经过了多次缝补，不过还是显出一副可爱的模样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“那你打算偷什么呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He shrugged. "Money, food, jewelry. Whatever I can get my hands on." It sounded simple enough.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他耸了耸肩。“钱、珠宝、食物，偷到什么就是什么。”这计划听起来够简单的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It wasn't until fifteen minutes later, when Liesel watched the sudden silence on his face, that she realized Rudy Steiner wasn't stealing anything. The commitment had disappeared, and although he still watched the imagined glory of stealing, she could see that now he was not believing it. He was trying to believe it, and that's never a good sign. His criminal greatness was unfurling before his eyes, and as the footsteps slowed and they watched the houses, Liesel's relief was pure and sad inside her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一刻钟后，莉泽尔看到他的脸色突然平静下来，她才意识到鲁迪不会去偷东西了。他那副毅然决然的表情已经消失。尽管他仍在幻想偷盗的荣耀，但她看得出现在连他自己都不相信了。他只是试图去相信，这可不是什么好迹象。伟大的犯罪事业已经展现在他眼前，可是他们俩放慢脚步看着那些房子的时候，莉泽尔打心底松了口气，心里却又感到悲伤。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A few weeks later, the toolbox ended up being good for at least something. Rudy cleared it of screwdrivers and hammers and chose instead to store in it many of the Steiners' valuables for the next air raid. The only item that remained was the teddy bear.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="几个星期后，这只工具箱至少派上了用场。鲁迪拿走了螺丝刀和榔头，把自家值钱的家当放了进去，为下次空袭做好了准备。原来的东西都没了，只剩下那只泰迪熊。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">While the Steiners rushed down Himmel Street, Michael Holtzapfel was knocking furiously at Rosa Hubermann's door. When she and Liesel came out, he handed them his problem. "My mother," he said, and the plums of blood were still on his bandage. "She won't come out. She's sitting at the kitchen table."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当施泰纳一家狂奔过希默尔街时，米夏埃尔·霍尔茨埃普费尔用力地敲着胡伯曼家的大门。罗莎和莉泽尔来到门口，米夏埃尔给她们出了一道难题。“我妈守在餐桌旁不肯走了。”他说道，绷带上依旧留着李子大小的血斑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As the weeks had worn on, Frau Holtzapfel had not yet begun to recover. When Liesel came to read, the woman spent most of the time staring at the window.

Tact had never been Rosa Hubermann's strong point. "If you don't come out, we're all going to die here on the street!" She turned and viewed the helpless figures on the footpath. A siren had just finished wailing. "What now?"</div>

<div class="line_en">It's probably fair to say that in all the years of Hitler's reign, no person was able to serve the Fuhrer as loyally as me. A human doesn't have a heart like mine. The human heart is a line, whereas my own is a circle, and I have the endless ability to be in the right place at the right time. The consequence of this is that I'm always finding humans at their best and worst. I see their ugly and their beauty, and I wonder how the same thing can be both. Still, they have one thing I envy. Humans, if nothing else, have the good sense to die.</div>
