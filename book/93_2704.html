<div class="line_en">The colorful falling leaves rustle through the trees on this brisk October morning in 1990. Jason and his sister Joanna get into the car and drive to school. Jason is driving this morning. He has just received his permit and is very anxious to start driving on his own. His sister Joanna is one year older than him and is showing him the specific points of driving, as if in a workshop. Today, she decides that he should drive to school. He takes the wheel and proceeds slowly down the back roads to Hill High School. These are backcountry roads and the twists cause Jason to drive slowly and cautiously. He takes each turn with a bit of bravado and his sister teases him that he is becoming a "coward" and tells him to speed up a bit. They will be late for school if he doesn't step on it! He presses the gas pedal down and accelerates but finds it difficult to tame the steering wheel of the mobile locomotive. His sister tells him to watch the road attentively, but he turns to tell her a witty remake and doesn't see the embankment ahead of him. Just a second of distraction rotating the wheel, he sending the car down to the embankment, and the car roils over and over and hits a tree. Jason's head hits the wind shield and he is trapped between that and the steering wheel. He can't breathe and is losing consciousness. Joanna tries desperately to free him, but is unable to. She does the only thing possible -- that is to escape out of the open window and find help… fast!</div>

<div class="line_en">Jason lived only sixteen years but he did so much in his short time on Earth. He was very academic, a musician, an athlete, a golf fanatic, liked archeology and was a lover of life. He had many, many friends and thirsted for living, which was quite unlike anyone I had witnessed. He had the kind of boyish charm and he lit up a room when he entered it. He had a beautiful: smile and kind words for everyone. I have never seen him get angry but he was always cheerful and intelligent. I was Jason's godmother and when he was baptized in 1974, he had the coolest priest. The priest had long hair and sandals. I still smile when I think about that priest. Jason cried when I held him for the blessing of the water but not for very long. The ceremony only took a few moments, but looking down at Jason, I knew then, that this was indeed a special child. It turned out my impressions were correct.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杰森只活了 16 年，但他在地球上的短暂时间里做了这么多。他学识渊博，是个音乐家，运动员，高尔夫球迷，喜欢考古学，热爱生活。他有许许多多的朋友，渴望生存，这和我见过的任何人都不一样。他有一种男孩般的魅力，当他走进房间的时候，整个房间都被他照亮了。他有一个美丽的：微笑和善意的话对每个人。我从来没有见过他生气，但他总是快乐而聪明。我是杰森的教母，当他在 1974 年受洗时，他有最酷的牧师。祭司留着长发，穿着凉鞋。每当我想起那个牧师，我还是会微笑。当我抱着杰森祈求水的祝福时，他哭了，但没有哭很久。仪式只花了几分钟，但看着杰森，我知道，这确实是一个特别的孩子。事实证明我的印象是正确的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ambulances arrive in a few minutes but Jason is unconscious. They have to extricate him with the "Jaws of Life". He is taken to the hospital and for three days he lies between life and death. He is breathing only with the assistance of a respirator. That has limited his brain activity. The doctors take Jeff aside and notify him that Jason has extensive brain damage and that there is no real hope that Jason would be normal again. Jeff must make a decision whether to turn off the respirator and let Jason die in peace. He thinks that it's the best decision but it is also the most painful one he has ever made in his life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="救护车几分钟后就到了，但是杰森已经不省人事了。他们必须用“救生钳”把他解救出来。他被送往医院，在三天的时间里他处于生死关头。他只有在呼吸器的帮助下才能呼吸。这限制了他的大脑活动。医生把杰夫叫到一边，告诉他杰森有大面积的脑损伤，杰森没有恢复正常的真正希望。杰夫必须做出决定决定是否关掉呼吸器，让杰森平静地死去。他认为这是最好的决定，但也是他一生中做过的最痛苦的决定。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jason and Jeff shared a durable bond. They did everything together from the time he was born. When they had a free moment, they would be golfing, skiing, playing badminton. They formed a bond of love that remains even beyond the boundaries of life and death. It is an extraordinary relationship between father and son.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杰森和杰夫有着持久的联系。从他出生起，他们就在一起做任何事情。当他们有空的时候，他们会去打高尔夫，滑雪，打羽毛球。他们形成了一种爱的纽带，甚至超越了生与死的界限。这是一种非同寻常的父子关系。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">One year earlier, Jason was pursuing another kind of sports: Skiing. He liked the skiing attitude. A few of his friends drove up to Sugarloaf Mountain and skied for the whole day. You know, Sugarloaf has a wonderful mountain slope for skiing. Jason spent the day back and forth along the mountain skiing trails for many runs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一年前，杰森还在从事另一种运动：滑雪。他喜欢这种滑雪的姿势。他的几个朋友开车去糖面包山滑了一整天的雪。你知道，舒格洛夫有一个很棒的滑雪山坡。杰森一整天都在山地滑雪道上来回跑步。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jeff was an enthusiastic, devoted and a superb father to Jason and Joanna. He made sure that he spent a lot of time with his children. Time seemed to be of the utmost importance to him as well as having fun. He always enjoyed life and was a bit of a risk taker. Golf was a pastime that Jason and Jeff shared. It was almost religions. They would even attempt to golf when there was accumulation of snow on the golf course. Jason would just put his gloves on and laugh. "I must golf!" he would say, "I love it!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对于杰森和乔安娜来说，杰夫是一个热情、忠诚和出色的父亲。他确保自己有很多时间和孩子们在一起。时间对他来说似乎和玩乐一样重要。他总是很享受生活，有点爱冒险。高尔夫是杰森和杰夫共同的消遣。这几乎就是宗教。他们甚至会在高尔夫球场积雪的时候打高尔夫球。杰森会戴上手套然后大笑。“我必须打高尔夫！”他会说，“我喜欢！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Once sunset was illuminating the snow and there was a group of trees ahead. The sun blinded him for a second and he tried to avoid the trees but ran into. The ski pole plunged right into his head and fractured his skull. There was a gush of blood on his head but Jason did his best to slide down the mountain. He drove himself to the emergency room, where the doctors scratch their heads wondering how he was injured. But he was lucky to be alive. A few days later, Jason was back on the ski slopes like nothing happened at all. He was just that kind of young man. He overcame the misfortune and lived for exactly one extra year. Jeff told this story at Jason's funeral. His eyes filled up with tears of love every time he mentioned Jason's name.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有一次，夕阳照亮了积雪，前面有一群树。阳光使他失明了一秒钟，他试图避开树木， 但还是撞上了。滑雪杆直接插入他的头部，使他的头骨骨折。他的头上涌出了一股血，但是杰森尽力从山上滑下来。他自己开车去了急诊室，医生们挠着头想知道他是怎么受伤的。但他很幸运还活着。几天后，杰森又回到了滑雪场，就像什么都没发生过一样。他就是那种年轻人。他克服了不幸，多活了整整一年。杰夫在杰森的葬礼上讲了这个故事。每当他提到杰森的名字，他的眼睛里就充满了爱的泪水。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jason's bedroom is a testimony to his personality and his life. He has a collection of model airplanes. On the piano there is still the music of the song that was Jason's favorite of his time, "Chariots of Fire". Jason was a very outgoing young man. He was an accomplished student and a sportsman. Jason had lots of merits and had many, many friends who loved him. I loved Jason very much. Jeff and Jason share a bond of affection that defies death.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杰森的卧室证明了他的个性和生活。他收集了一些飞机模型。钢琴上仍然有杰森那个时代最喜欢的歌曲《烈火战车》的音乐。杰森是一个非常外向的年轻人。他是一个有成就的学生和运动员。杰森有很多优点，有很多很多爱他的朋友。我非常爱杰森。杰夫和杰森之间有着共同的情感纽带，这种纽带能够战胜死亡。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Today, Jeff's home is open to anyone who has a thirst for living. He loves to have fun. He isn't the one to sit still and let life pass him by. He wants to help young people develop their potentials. He is a member of a mutual aid association. He set up a college fund for the study of music and it would be available to any eligible student who shares Jason's philosophy of being outgoing and hardworking. It is called the Jason Music Scholarship Fund. It is his way of carrying on Jason's musical dreams. Now Jason rests by a beautiful river in a bed of roses. Jeff visits him every week, along with his wife.</div>
