<div class="line_en">It was certainly rather cool of him to say to the Emperor's daughter, "Will you have me?" But so he did; for his name was renowned far and wide; and there were a hundred princesses who would have answered, "Yes!" and "Thank you kindly." We shall see what this princess said.</div>

<div class="line_en">There was once a poor Prince, who had a kingdom. His kingdom was very small, but still quite large enough to marry upon; and he wished to marry.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从前有一个贫穷的王子，他有一个王国。王国虽然非常小，可是还是够供给他结婚的费用，而结婚正是他现在想要做的事情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Listen! It happened that where the Prince's father lay buried, there grew a rose tree-a most beautiful rose tree, which blossomed only once in every five years, and even then bore only one flower, but that was a rose! It smelt so sweet that all cares and sorrows were forgotten by him who inhaled its fragrance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在我们听吧，在这王子的父亲的墓上长着一棵玫瑰——一棵很美丽的玫瑰。它五年才开一次花，而且每次只开一朵。但这是一朵多么好的玫瑰花啊！它发出那么芬芳的香气，无论谁只须闻一下，就会忘掉一切忧愁和烦恼。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And furthermore, the Prince had a nightingale, who could sing in such a manner that it seemed as though all sweet melodies dwelt in her little throat. So the Princess was to have the rose, and the nightingale; and they were accordingly put into large silver caskets, and sent to her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="王子还有一只夜莺。这鸟儿唱起歌来，就好像它小小的喉咙里包藏着一切和谐的调子似的，这朵玫瑰花和这只夜莺应该送给那位公主。因此这两件东西就被放在两个大银匣里，送给她了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Emperor had them brought into a large hall, where the Princess was playing at "Visiting," with the ladies of the court; and when she saw the caskets with the presents, she clapped her hands for joy.</div>
