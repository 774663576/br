<div class="line_en">Laurie lay luxuriously swinging to and fro in his hammock one warm September afternoon, wondering what his neighbors were about, but too lazy to go and find out. He was in one of his moods, for the day had been both unprofitable and unsatisfactory, and he was wishing he could live it over again. The hot weather made him indolent, and he had shirked his studies, tried Mr. Brooke's patience to the utmost, displeased his grandfather by practicing half the afternoon, frightened the maidservants half out of their wits by mischievously hinting that one of his dogs was going mad, and, after high words with the stableman about some fancied neglect of his horse, he had flung himself into his hammock to fume over the stupidity of the world in general, till the peace of the lovely day quieted him in spite of himself. Staring up into the green gloom of the horse-chestnut trees above him, he dreamed dreams of all sorts, and was just imagining himself tossing on the ocean in a voyage round the world, when the sound of voices brought him ashore in a flash. Peeping through the meshes of the hammock, he saw the Marches coming out, as if bound on some expedition.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, that's cool," said Laurie to himself, "to have a picnic and never ask me! They can't be going in the boat, for they haven't got the key. Perhaps they forgot it. I'll take it to them, and see what's going on."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好啊！”劳里自语道，”去野餐竟然不叫我！她们不会去乘那只艇吧？她们没有钥匙埃或者她们忘了呢；我把钥匙带给她们，看看是怎么回事。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Though possessed of half a dozen hats, it took him some time to find one, then there was a hunt for the key, which was at last discovered in his pocket, so that the girls were quite out of sight when he leaped the fence and ran after them. Taking the shortest way to the boathouse, he waited for them to appear, but no one came, and he went up the hill to take an observation. A grove of pines covered one part of it, and from the heart of this green spot came a clearer sound than the soft sigh of the pines or the drowsy chirp of the crickets.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽然帽子有半打之多，他花了不少功夫才找出一顶；接着又四处翻找钥匙，最后发现原来就在自己的衣袋里。这么一来，当他跃过围栏追过去时，姑娘们已经消失得无影无踪。他抄近路来到停放小艇的地方，等她们露面，却不见有人过来，便爬到小山丘顶上张望。小山丘的一面被松树林掩映着，绿林深处传来一个声音，其清脆怡人胜似松叶蝉鸣。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What in the world are those girls about now?" thought Laurie, opening his sleepy eyes to take a good look, for there was something rather peculiar in the appearance of his neighbors. Each wore a large, flapping hat, a brown linen pouch slung over one shoulder, and carried a long staff. Meg had a cushion, Jo a book, Beth a basket, and Amy a portfolio. All walked quietly through the garden, out at the little back gate, and began to climb the hill that lay between the house and river.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这个时候那些姑娘们到底要去干什么？”劳里想，一面睁开睡意惺忪的双眼看个究竟，因为他的邻居们打扮相当古怪。每人戴一顶悬垂着边儿的大帽，肩头斜挎一个棕色的亚麻布小袋，手拿一根长棍棒。梅格带着一个垫子，乔拿本书，贝思提个篮子，艾美夹个画夹。她们静静走过花园，出了后院小门，开始攀登位于屋子和小河之间的一座小山丘。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a rather pretty little picture, for the sisters sat together in the shady nook, with sun and shadow flickering over them, the aromatic wind lifting their hair and cooling their hot cheeks, and all the little wood people going on with their affairs as if these were no strangers but old friends. Meg sat upon her cushion, sewing daintily with her white hands, and looking as fresh and sweet as a rose in her pink dress among the green. Beth was sorting the cones that lay thick under the hemlock near by, for she made pretty things with them. Amy was sketching a group of ferns, and Jo was knitting as she read aloud. A shadow passed over the boy's face as he watched them, feeling that he ought to go away because uninvited; yet lingering because home seemed very lonely and this quiet party in the woods most attractive to his restless spirit. He stood so still that a squirrel, busy with its harvesting, ran down a pine close beside him, saw him suddenly and skipped back, scolding so shrilly that Beth looked up, espied the wistful face behind the birches, and beckoned with a reassuring smile.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这果然是一幅漂亮的小图画，只见四姐妹一起坐在树荫一角，斑驳的日影在她们身上摇曳不定，清风撩起她们的发梢，吹凉她们炽热的脸颊，林子里的几个小孩子全都继续忙着自己的事情，似乎她们是老朋友而不是陌生人。梅格穿着一身粉红色衣裙，坐在她带来的垫子上，用白皙的双手灵巧地穿针引线，林木青青，更显得她像玫瑰花般娇艳。贝思在挑拣铁杉树下堆了厚厚一层的松果，用来做精致的小玩意。艾美对着一丛蕨类植物写生，乔则一面编织一面大声朗读。男孩望着她们，脸上闪过一丝乌云，他觉得自己应该走开，因为人家并没有邀请自己，但却徘徊不去，因为他的家似乎十分孤寂乏味，而林中这个宁静的队伍又牢牢吸引着他那颗不安分的心。他呆呆静立一旁，一只忙着觅食的小松鼠从他身旁的一棵松树上溜下来，突然发现了他，吓得往后一跳，尖声叫了起来。贝思闻声抬起头，看见了白桦树后那张若有所思的脸孔，于是展颜一笑，向他致意。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Here's a landscape!" thought Laurie, peeping through the bushes, and looking wide-awake and good-natured already.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“万分感激。如果你们让我逗留一会，我什么事情都愿意做，因为那边闷得像撒哈拉大沙漠。我该做针线活、朗读、拣松果呢，还是画画？或者通通一起做？请吩咐吧，我恭敬从命。”劳里言毕坐下来，神情毕恭毕敬，令人愉快。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jo pointed, and Laurie sat up to examine, for through an opening in the wood one could look cross the wide, blue river, the meadows on the other side, far over the outskirts of the great city, to the green hills that rose to meet the sky. The sun was low, and the heavens glowed with the splendor of an autumn sunset. Gold and purple clouds lay on the hilltops, and rising high into the ruddy light were silvery white peaks that shone like the airy spires of some Celestial City.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="乔用手指去，劳里坐起来凝神观望。透过林中的空隙之处，可以看到宽阔、碧蓝的河流，隔河那边青青的草地，以及草地之外一望无际的郊野。极目之处，一脉绿色的山脉耸入云霄。时值秋季，夕阳西斜，天边霞光万道，蔚为壮观。山顶祥云缭绕，紫气千条，高高耸入红霞之中的银白色山峰金光灿烂，仿如传说中‘天国’的塔尖。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Mother likes to have us out-of-doors as much as possible, so we bring our work here and have nice times. For the fun of it we bring our things in these bags, wear the old hats, use poles to climb the hill, and play pilgrims, as we used to do years ago. We call this hill the Delectable Mountain, for we can look far away and see the country where we hope to live some time."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“妈妈喜欢我们多到户外活动，我们便把活计带到这来，过得开开心心。为了使这个活动增添趣味，我们把东西放在这些布袋里头，头戴旧帽子，手持登山用的棍子，扮演香客，就跟我们几年前玩的一样。我们把这座山丘叫做‘快乐山’，因为从这里可以远远望到我们日后希望居住的地方。”">查看中文翻译</div>
