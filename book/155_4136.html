<div class="line_en">Jem condescended to take me to school the first day, a job usually done by one's parents, but Atticus had said Jem would be delighted to show me where my room was. I think some money changed hands in this transaction, for as we trotted around the corner past the Radley Place I heard an unfamiliar jingle in Jem's pockets. When we slowed to a walk at the edge of the schoolyard, Jem was careful to explain that during school hours I was not to bother him, I was not to approach him with requests to enact a chapter of Tarzan and the Ant Men, to embarrass him with references to his private life, or tag along behind him at recess and noon. I was to stick with the first grade and he would stick with the fifth. In short, I was to leave him alone.</div>

<div class="line_en">Dill left us early in September, to return to Meridian. We saw him off on the five o'clock bus and I was miserable without him until it occurred to me that I would be starting to school in a week. I never looked forward more to anything in my life. Hours of wintertime had found me in the treehouse, looking over at the schoolyard, spying on multitudes of children through a two-power telescope Jem had given me, learning their games, following Jem's red jacket through wriggling circles of blind man's buff, secretly sharing their misfortunes and minor victories. I longed to join them.</div>

<div class="line_en">Miss Caroline was no more than twenty-one. She had bright auburn hair, pink cheeks, and wore crimson fingernail polish. She also wore high-heeled pumps and a red-and-white-striped dress. She looked and smelled like a peppermint drop. She boarded across the street one door down from us in Miss Maudie Atkinson's upstairs front room, and when Miss Maudie introduced us to her, Jem was in a haze for days.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡罗琳小姐不过二十一岁，金棕色的头发，粉红色的面颊，指甲上涂着深红色的指甲油。她脚上穿着一双高跟浅口无带皮鞋，身上穿着有红白条纹的连衣裙，看起来闻起来都象一根有红白条纹的薄荷棒糖。她住在街对面，和我们家斜对门。她住的是楼上的前房，莫迪·阿特金森小姐住在楼下。莫迪小姐介绍我们与她认识时，杰姆给她迷住了，一连好几天都是这样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Miss Caroline printed her name on the blackboard and said, "This says I am Miss Caroline Fisher. I am from North Alabama, from Winston County." The class murmured apprehensively, should she prove to harbor her share of the peculiarities indigenous to that region. (When Alabama seceded from the Union on January 11, 1861, Winston County seceded from Alabama, and every child in Maycomb County knew it.) North Alabama was full of Liquor Interests, Big Mules, steel companies, Republicans, professors, and other persons of no background.</div>

<div class="line_en">Miss Caroline began the day by reading us a story about cats. The cats had long conversations with one another, they wore cunning little clothes and lived in a warm house beneath a kitchen stove. By the time Mrs. Cat called the drugstore for an order of chocolate malted mice the class was wriggling like a bucketful of catawba worms. Miss Caroline seemed unaware that the ragged, denim-shirted and floursack-skirted first grade, most of whom had chopped cotton and fed hogs from the time they were able to walk, were immune to imaginative literature. Miss Caroline came to the end of the story and said, "Oh, my, wasn't that nice?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="上课一开始，卡罗琳小姐给我们读了个有关猫的放孰这群猫相互之问交谈了很久，它们都穿着精巧的小衣服，住在炉，灶下面的一问暖和的房子里。她读到猫大妈去杂货店定购巧克力麦芽老鼠时，全班同学象一桶长在葡萄上的虫似地蠕动起来。这些身穿褴楼的斜纹粗布衬衣或面粉口袋布裙子的一年级学生，大部分别会走路时就开始喂猪、摘棉花，对唤起想象力的文学作品毫无接受能力。而卡罗琳小姐对这点一无所知。读完故事后她说：“啊，多好的故事！”">查看中文翻译</div>

Miss Caroline told me to tell my father not to teach me any more, it would interfere with my reading.</div>

<div class="line_en">I mumbled that I was sorry and retired meditating upon my crime. I never deliberately learned to read, but somehow I had been wallowing illicitly in the daily papers. In the long hours of church -- was it then I learned? I could not remember not being able to read hymns. Now that I was compelled to think about it, reading was something that just came to me, as learning to fasten the seat of my union suit without looking around, or achieving two bows from a snarl of shoelaces. I could not remember when the lines above Atticus's moving finger separated into words, but I had stared at them all the evenings in my memory, listening to the news of the day, Bills to Be Enacted into Laws, the diaries of Lorenzo Dow -- anything Atticus happened to be reading when I crawled into his lap every night. Until I feared I would lose it, I never loved to read. One does not love breathing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我咕哝着说对不起，然后坐下，开始考虑我到底有什么罪过。我从没有专门学过识字，但有时候的确私自抱着报纸读个不停。我常常上教堂做礼拜——是在那儿学会的吗？我记不起我有过不会读赞美诗的时候。既然被迫考虑这个问题，我觉得识字的能力对我来说是自然而然地获得的，好象不用学习就能不往后看而把连衫裤系好一样，不用学习就能把鞋带打两个蝴蝶结一样。我记不清阿迪克斯移动的手指所指的一行行句子是怎样分为一个个单词的。在我的记忆中，每天晚上我都注意地看着这些字，耳朵听着当天的新闻，如“提案将被通过成为法律”啦，某某人的日记啦，等等。一句话，每天晚上趴在爸爸的膝匕，他读什么我听什么。要不是担心会忘记所听到的词句，我从不爱自己读书。人之所以要呼吸是不得已，我读书也是这样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Having never questioned Jem's pronouncements, I saw no reason to begin now. The Dewey Decimal System consisted, in part, of Miss Caroline waving cards at us on which were printed "the," "cat," "rat," "man," and "you." No comment seemed to be expected of us, and the class received these impressionistic revelations in silence. I was bored, so I began a letter to Dill. Miss Caroline caught me writing and told me to tell my father to stop teaching me. "Besides," she said. "We don't write in the first grade, we print. You won't learn to write until you're in the third grade."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杰姆说的话我从来没怀疑过，现在也没有怀疑的必要。杜威教学法的一部分内容就是卡罗琳小姐在课堂上朝我们挥舞卡片，上面写着“这个”、“猫”、“老鼠”、“男人”、“你”等等。好象不要我们作什么回答，全班默默地接受这些印象主义的新启示。我不耐烦了，便给迪尔写信。正写着，卡罗琳小姐发现了。她叫我告诉爸爸别再教我了。“而且，”她说，“一年级学生不学写作，只学写字。你们要到三年级才练习写作。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Calpurnia was to blame for this. It kept me from driving her crazy on rainy days, I guess. She would set me a writing task by scrawling the alphabet firmly across the top of a tablet, then copying out a chapter of the Bible beneath. If I reproduced her penmanship satisfactorily, she rewarded me with an open-faced sandwich of bread and butter and sugar. In Calpurnia's teaching, there was no sentimentality: I seldom pleased her and she seldom rewarded me.</div>

<div class="line_en">Atticus said professional people were poor because the farmers were poor. As Maycomb County was farm country, nickels and dimes were hard to come by for doctors and dentists and lawyers. Entailment was only a part of Mr. Cunningham's vexations. The acres not entailed were mortgaged to the hilt, and the little cash he made went to interest. If he held his mouth right, Mr. Cunningham could get a WPA job, but his land would go to ruin if he left it, and he was willing to go hungry to keep his land and vote as he pleased. Mr. Cunningham, said Atticus, came from a set breed of men.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿迪克斯说，医生和律师之所以穷是因为农民穷。梅科姆县是以农业为主的县，医生、牙医、律师很难收到现金。限定继承权只是坎宁安先生苦恼的一部分。那些没有限定继承人的土地全部被用来当抵押物，得来的一点点钱又全都付了利息。如果开口韵话，坎宁安先生本来可以在工程规划署找个工作做做，可是他一走，土地就要荒了，于是他宁愿挨饿种地，自由一些。阿迪克斯说坎宁安先生属于那种性情固执的人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We watched. One morning Jem and I found a load of stovewood in the back yard. Later, a sack of hickory nuts appeared on the back steps. With Christmas came a crate of smilax and holly. That spring when we found a crokersack full of turnip greens, Atticus said Mr. Cunningham had more than paid him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们一直在等着瞧。一天早上，我和杰姆在后院发现一搁干柴。后来，在屋后的台阶上出现了一袋山核桃。圣诞节时，又来了一箱菝葜和圣诞节装饰用的冬青类树枝。今年春天，我们发现一袋萝卜菜时，阿迪克斯说坎宁安家给我们的东西已经超过了应该付的钱。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As the Cunninghams had no money to pay a lawyer, they simply paid us with what they had. "Did you know," said Atticus, "that Dr. Reynolds works the same way?

Jem's definitions are very nearly accurate sometimes."</div>

<div class="line_en">I thought she was going to spit in it, which was the only reason anybody in Maycomb held out his hand: it was a time-honored method of sealing oral contracts. Wondering what bargain we had made, I turned to the class for an answer, but the class looked back at me in puzzlement. Miss Caroline picked up her ruler, gave me half a dozen quick little pats, then told me to stand in the corner. A storm of laughter broke loose when it finally occurred to the class that Miss Caroline had whipped me.</div>

<div class="line_en">When Miss Caroline threatened it with a similar fate the first grade exploded again, becoming cold sober only when the shadow of Miss Blount fell over them. Miss Blount, a native Maycombian as yet uninitiated in the mysteries of the Decimal System, appeared at the door hands on hips and announced: "If I hear another sound from this room I'll burn up everybody in it. Miss Caroline, the sixth grade cannot concentrate on the pyramids for all this racket!"</div>
