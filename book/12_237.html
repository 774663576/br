<div class="line_en">Dusk deepened. Mist lay behind them among the trees below, and brooded on the pale margins of the Anduin, but the sky was clear. Stars came out. The waxing moon was riding in the West, and the shadows of the rocks were black. They had come to the feet of stony hills, and their pace was slower, for the trail was no longer easy to follow. Here the highlands of the Emyn Muil ran from North to South in two long tumbled ridges. The western side of each ridge was steep and difficult, but the eastward slopes were gentler, furrowed with many gullies and narrow ravines. All night the three companions scrambled in this bony land, climbing to the crest of the first and tallest ridge, and down again into the darkness of a deep winding valley on the other side.</div>

<div class="line_en">There in the still cool hour before dawn they rested for a brief space. The moon had long gone down before them, the stars glittered above them; the first light of day had not yet come over the dark hills behind. For the moment Aragorn was at a loss: the orc-trail had descended into the valley, but there it had vanished.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在黎明来临之前的凉爽空气中，他们休息了很短的一段时间。月亮已经西沉，星光依旧灿烂，曙光则还没有越过背后的黑暗山丘，照耀在大地上。此时，阿拉贡觉得不知所措：半兽人的足迹进入了河谷，但也在那边消失了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"They will not make for the river, whatever mark they aim at," said Aragorn. "And unless there is much amiss in Rohan and the power of Saruman is greatly increased, they will take the shortest way that they can find over the fields of the Rohirrim. Let us search northwards!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿拉贡说：“不管目标是哪里，他们都不会朝河走，除非洛汗国的状况比我们想象的还要糟，而萨鲁曼的影响力又大为增加，否则他们还是会以最短的路径穿越洛汗国。我们往北走！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The dale ran like a stony trough between the ridged hills, and a trickling stream flowed among the boulders at the bottom. A cliff frowned upon their right; to their left rose grey slopes, dim and shadowy in the late night. They went on for a mile or more northwards. Aragorn was searching, bent towards the ground, among the folds and gullies leading up into the western ridge. Legolas was some way ahead. Suddenly the Elf gave a cry and the others came running towards him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="河谷像是条石造的沟渠一样在山丘之间蜿蜒，一条小溪则是在岩石间奔流着。众人的右边是一座陡峭的岩壁，左边则是在夜色中显得十分灰暗的山坡。他们又往北走了一段距离。阿拉贡低头不停的搜索，希望能在西边崎岖的地形中找到一些线索。勒苟拉斯走在前方。突然间，精灵大喊一声，其它人立刻跑向他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"We have already overtaken some of those that we are hunting," he said. "Look!" He pointed, and they saw that what they had at first taken to be boulders lying at the foot of the slope were huddled bodies. Five dead Orcs lay there. They had been hewn with many cruel strokes, and two had been beheaded. The ground was wet with their dark blood.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“看来我们已经赶上了一部分的敌人，”他说。“你们看！”他指着前面，众人这才发现前方的岩石间堆着五具半兽人的尸体。他们浑身上下都是伤痕，其中两名连脑袋都被砍掉了。地上全都沾满了他们黑色的血液。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Which way would they turn, do you think?" said Legolas. "Northward to take a straighter road to Isengard, or Fangorn, if that is their aim as you guess? Or southward to strike the Entwash?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"No," said Aragorn. "The Rohirrim seldom come here, and it is far from Minas Tirith. It might be that some company of Men were hunting here for reasons that we do not know. Yet I think not."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没有，”阿拉贡说，“洛汗人极少来这边，这距离米那斯提力斯又很远。或许是一群人类在这边，为了我们不明白的原因在狩猎吧。不过，我觉得这猜测可能性很小。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你觉得可能的状况是什么？”金雳问道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yet however you read it, it seems not unhopeful," said Legolas. "Enemies of the Orcs are likely to be our friends. Do any folk dwell in these hills?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不过，不管你怎么样解读，这看起来都不算绝望，”勒苟拉斯说，“半兽人的敌人多半就是我们的朋友。这一带山区有任何居民吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I think that the enemy brought his own enemy with him," answered Aragorn. "These are Northern Orcs from far away. Among the slain are none of the great Orcs with the strange badges. There was a quarrel, I guess: it is no uncommon thing with these foul folk. Maybe there was some dispute about the road."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我认为我们的敌人自己把敌人引来了，”阿拉贡回答。“这些是从远地来的北方半兽人。在这些尸体中并没有那些身材高大，配戴奇怪徽章的半兽人。我推测他们在这里起了争执：对于这些家伙来说，这是很稀松平常的事情。或许他们为了该朝哪边走而争执不下。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Aragorn searched the ground in a wide circle, but no other traces of the fight could be found. They went on. Already the eastward sky was turning pale; the stars were fading, and a grey light was slowly growing. A little further north they came to a fold in which a tiny stream, falling and winding, had cut a stony path down into the valley. In it some bushes grew, and there were patches of grass upon its sides.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿拉贡仔细搜索着方圆数尺之内的地面，但找不到其它任何打斗的痕迹。他们继续往前走。东方的天空已经开始微亮，星辰正在缓缓下沉，灰色的光芒正缓缓浮现。他们往北又走了一段路之后，来到了一个洼地。在此，一条小溪切穿了岩石，淅哩哗啦的流入山谷中。洼地中生长着一些矮灌木，两边则是长着许多翠绿的青草。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Swiftly now the pursuers turned and followed the new path. As if fresh from a night's rest they sprang from stone to stone. At last they reached the crest of the grey hill, and a sudden breeze blew in their hair and stirred their cloaks: the chill wind of dawn.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="追兵们很快地转过身，跟着新的踪迹继续赶路。由于发现了新线索，一群人彷佛经过整夜的休息一般精力充沛，在嶙峋的岩石间蹦跳奔驰。他们好不容易终于奔上了灰色的丘陵，突如其来的和风吹拂过他们的斗篷和发际：这是黎明前的冰寒柔风。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Turning back they saw across the River the far hills kindled. Day leaped into the sky. The red rim of the sun rose over the shoulders of the dark land. Before them in the West the world lay still, formless and grey; but even as they looked, the shadows of night melted, the colours of the waking earth returned: green flowed over the wide meads of Rohan; the white mists shimmered in the water-vales; and far off to the left, thirty leagues or more, blue and purple stood the White Mountains, rising into peaks of jet, tipped with glimmering snows, flushed with the rose of morning.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="众人不约而同地转过身，看着河对岸远方渐渐模糊的山丘。日光照耀在大地上，镶着红边的太阳从黑暗的大地上露出头来。他们眼前是静滞不动的西方世界，黑夜的暗影渐渐消融，大地重新拾回缤纷色彩；绿色的浪潮重新掩盖了洛汗大地，河谷间飘汤白色迷雾，在他们左方大约九十哩，是闪耀着蓝紫色光芒的白色山脉；尖锐陡峭的山峰反射着玫瑰色的晨光，让人难以逼视。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The ridge upon which the companions stood went down steeply before their feet. Below it twenty fathoms or more, there was a wide and rugged shelf which ended suddenly in the brink of a sheer cliff: the East Wall of Rohan. So ended the Emyn Muil, and the green plains of the Rohirrim stretched away before them to the edge of sight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="先前的陡坡开始快速倾斜，在距离大约两百尺远的地方，陡坡突然被险峻的峭壁所取代了：这是洛汗国的东墙。这就是艾明莫尔高地的尾端，眼前则是骠骑国一望无际的绿色草原。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Look!" cried Legolas, pointing up into the pale sky above them. "There is the eagle again! He is very high. He seems to be flying now away, from this land back to the North. He is going with great speed. Look!"</div>

<div class="line_en">They followed their enemies now by the clear light of day. It seemed that the Orcs had pressed on with all possible speed. Every now and again the pursuers found things that had been dropped or cast away: food-bags, the rinds and crusts of hard grey bread, a torn black cloak, a heavy iron-nailed shoe broken on the stones. The trail led them north along the top of the escarpment, and at length they came to a deep cleft carved in the rock by a stream that splashed noisily down. In the narrow ravine a rough path descended like a steep stair into the plain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此时，他们开始趁着明亮的天光跟踪敌人，看来这些半兽人似乎也是尽可能地拔足狂奔。三人时常可以在路边找到遗落或是被刻意抛弃的物品：食物袋、灰色硬面包的残屑、一件撕破的黑斗篷、一双在岩石上踏破的沉重铁底鞋。对方留下的痕迹，让他们一路来到了陡坡的顶端，在那边则是一条潺潺流下的激流。在狭窄的河谷中，他们找到一条极难辨认、简陋的石梯一路蜿蜒而下。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I doubt if you will find a path quicker than the one that the Orcs chose," said Aragorn.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Many things," said Legolas. "It is a great company on foot; but I cannot say more, nor see what kind of folk they may be. They are many leagues away: twelve, I guess; but the flatness of the plain is hard to measure."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“应该是很多生物才对，”勒苟拉斯说：“我只能看出那是一大群步行生物，但我没办法判断他们的种族。他们距离我们好几十哩，我猜至少三十六哩以上，这块大平原很难让人确实估计它的距离。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At the bottom they came with a strange suddenness on the grass of Rohan. It swelled like a green sea up to the very foot of the Emyn Muil. The falling stream vanished into a deep growth of cresses and water-plants, and they could hear it tinkling away in green tunnels, down long gentle slopes towards the fens of Entwash Vale far away. They seemed to have left winter clinging to the hills behind. Here the air was softer and warmer, and faintly scented, as if spring was already stirring and the sap was flowing again in herb and leaf. Legolas took a deep breath, like one that drinks a great draught after long thirst in barren places.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在道路的底端，他们脱离了多岩的地形，来到了洛汗国的大草地上；如此突然的转变，让众人都觉得十分突兀。这块绵延不断的大草地，如同绿色的大海一般浸泡着艾明莫尔高地。溪水隐没在及膝高的水生植物和杂草之间，众人都可以听见它潺潺的流水声，继续朝着远方的树沐河谷而去。他们似乎已经把冬天抛弃在身后的高地上，此地的空气变得比较温暖、柔和，似乎还飘着春天特有的草叶和花朵的芬芳。勒苟拉斯深吸一口气，仿佛刚自荒漠离开的旅人，品尝着甘泉一般地享受这一切。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“没错，”他说：“这很显然是哈比人的脚印，我想应该是皮聘的，他比其它人都要矮小。你们看看这个！”他拿起一样在阳光下闪耀的东西，它看起来像是老树上的新鲜嫩叶，在这块四处都是大草原、没有森林的地方，显得格外美丽。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Stay!" he shouted. "Do not follow me yet!" He ran quickly to the right, away from the main trail; for he had seen footprints that went that way, branching off from the others, the marks of small unshod feet. These, however, did not go far before they were crossed by orc-prints, also coming out from the main trail behind and in front, and then they curved sharply back again and were lost in the trampling. At the furthest point Aragorn stooped and picked up something from the grass; then he ran back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“留在这里！”他匆忙大喊：“先别跟过来！”他飞快地跑向右边，离开那道明显的痕迹，因为他发现了一对没有穿铁鞋的小脚印冲向这方向。不过，隔不了多远，这些脚印就被从同样一个地方赶来的半兽人脚印追上来。这对脚印又回到原先的道路上，再度被半兽人的足迹所掩盖。阿拉贡在小脚印出现的最远处弯下身，捡起草地上的某样东西，然后又跑了回来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So the third day of their pursuit began. During all its long hours of cloud and fitful sun they hardly paused, now striding, now running, as if no weariness could quench the fire that burned them. They seldom spoke. Over the wide solitude they passed and their elven-cloaks faded against the background of the grey-green fields; even in the cool sunlight of mid-day few but Elvish eyes would have marked them, until they were close at hand. Often in their hearts they thanked the Lady of Lórien for the gift of lembas, for they could eat of it and find new strength even as they ran.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就这样，追击的第三天揭开了序幕。在这云雾笼罩的一整天中，他们几乎没有停下来；有时快步，有时狂奔，彷佛没有任何事情能够熄灭他们胸中的火焰。他们几乎一言不发，三人所披着的精灵斗篷，让他们在四野的沉寂中完美地融入草原；除了精灵之外，没有人能够在远方注意到他们的形迹。他们心中，对于赐给他们精灵干粮的兰巴斯女皇，真是无限感激；因为，这些干粮每一口都替他们带来了新的力量。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">All day the track of their enemies led straight on, going north-west without a break or turn. As once again the day wore to its end they came to long treeless slopes, where the land rose, swelling up towards a line of low humpbacked downs ahead. The orc-trail grew fainter as it bent north towards them, for the ground became harder and the grass shorter. Far away to the left the river Entwash wound, a silver thread in a green floor. No moving thing could be seen. Often Aragorn wondered that they saw no sign of beast or man. The dwellings of the Rohirrim were for the most part many leagues away to the South, under the wooded eaves of the White Mountains, now hidden in mist and cloud; yet the Horse-lords had formerly kept many herds and studs in the Eastemnet, this easterly region of their realm, and there the herdsmen had wandered much, living in camp and tent, even in winter-time. But now all the land was empty, and there was a silence that did not seem to be the quiet of peace.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="由于敌人朝着西北方马不停蹄地赶路，他们整天都寻着笔直的脚印穷追不舍。到了黄昏的时候，他们来到了一座毫无树木的斜坡前面，在那之后则是一连串的丘陵起伏。半兽人的足迹朝北的丘陵地前进，却也变得比较模糊；因为这区的土地变得比较坚硬，草也变得比较短，在极远处树沐河转了个弯，成为在绿色大地上的一条银线。阿拉贡开始怀疑，为何完全没有看见野兽或是人类的踪迹？洛汗国主要的人类聚居地还在南边许多哩的地方，也就是在白色山脉的森林底下，极目看去，该处现在隐藏在白色的迷雾之中。不过，这些牧马王们曾经在东洛汗放牧了许多马匹和牲畜，即使在冬天的时候，此地也应该满布寻水草而居的牧人们的帐棚和牲口才对。但现在，此地空无一物，空气中似乎隐藏着暴雨欲来的紧张气氛。">查看中文翻译</div>

The stars are faint; and I am weary as I have seldom been before, weary as no Ranger should be with a clear trail to follow.

<div class="line_en">The others sprang up, and almost at once they set off again. Slowly the downs drew near. It was still an hour before noon when they reached them: green slopes rising to bare ridges that ran in a line straight towards the North. At their feet the ground was dry and the turf short, but a long strip of sunken land, some ten miles wide, lay between them and the river wandering deep in dim thickets of reed and rush. Just to the West of the southernmost slope there was a great ring, where the turf had been torn and beaten by many trampling feet. From it the orc-trail ran out again, turning north along the dry skirts of the hills. Aragorn halted and examined the tracks closely.</div>

They were going slowly now, and Gimli's back was bent. Stone-hard are the Dwarves in labour or journey, but this endless chase began to tell on him, as all hope failed in his heart. Aragorn walked behind him, grim and silent, stooping now and again to scan some print or mark upon the ground. Only Legolas still stepped as lightly as ever, his feet hardly seeming to press the grass, leaving no footprints as he passed; but in the waybread of the Elves he found all the sustenance that he needed, and he could sleep, if sleep it could be called by Men, resting his mind in the strange paths of Elvish dreams, even as he walked open-eyed in the light of this world.</div>

Beyond there glimmered far away, as if floating on a grey cloud, the white head of tall Methedras, the last peak of the Misty Mountains. Out of the forest the Entwash flowed to meet them, its stream now swift and narrow, and its banks deep-cloven. The orc-trail turned from the downs towards it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们可以看见洛汗国一望无际的大平原，和多天前在大河边看到的景象并无二致。西北方则是黑暗的法贡森林，距离一行人大约还有三十哩左右的距离，森林的尽头则消逝在远方的蓝色天空下。在更远处，则是一个彷佛飘浮在云海之上的马西德拉斯峰，也就是迷雾山脉的最后一个山峰。树沐河从林中流出，湍急的河水将河岸切出一道深深的缝隙，半兽人的脚印从山脚下转向河边。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Following with his keen eyes the trail to the river, and then the river back towards the forest, Aragorn saw a shadow on the distant green, a dark swift-moving blur. He cast himself upon the ground and listened again intently. But Legolas stood beside him, shading his bright elven-eyes with his long slender hand, and he saw not a shadow, nor a blur, but the small figures of horsemen, many horsemen, and the glint of morning on the tips of their spears was like the twinkle of minute stars beyond the edge of mortal sight. Far behind them a dark smoke rose in thin curling threads.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿拉贡锐利的目光跟着那足迹移向河边，接着又转向森林，他看见远方的绿地上有一块急速移动的暗影，他立刻趴向地面，仔细地倾听着。勒苟拉斯则是站在旁边，用他纤细的手指遮住日光，看向远方。在他的眼中那不是黑影，而是许许多多的骑兵，骑兵手上的长枪在阳光下反射着针尖般的光芒，凡人眼中是无法分辨得这么清楚的。在他们身后更远的地方，则是袅袅上升的黑烟。">查看中文翻译</div>

"They are proud and wilful, but they are true-hearted, generous in thought and deed; bold but not cruel; wise but unlearned, writing no books but singing many songs, after the manner of the children of Men before the Dark Years. But I do not know what has happened here of late, nor in what mind the Rohirrim may now be between the traitor Saruman and the threat of Sauron. They have long been the friends of the people of Gondor, though they are not akin to them. It was in forgotten years long ago that Eorl the Young brought them out of the North, and their kinship is rather with the Bardings of Dale, and with the Beornings of the Wood, among whom may still be seen many men tall and fair, as are the Riders of Rohan.

<div class="line_en">"Gandalf!" Éomer exclaimed. "Gandalf Greyhame is known in the Mark; but his name, I warn you, is no longer a password to the king's favour. He has been a guest in the land many times in the memory of men, coming as he will, after a season, or after many years. He is ever the herald of strange events: a bringer of evil, some now say. Indeed since his last coming in the summer all things have gone amiss. At that time our trouble with Saruman began. Until then we counted Saruman our friend, but Gandalf came then and warned us that sudden war was preparing in Isengard. He said that he himself had been a prisoner in Orthanc and had hardly escaped, and he begged for help. But Théoden would not listen to him, and he went away. Speak not the name of Gandalf loudly in Théoden's ears! He is wroth. For Gandalf took the horse that is called Shadowfax, the most precious of all the king's steeds, chief of the Mearas, which only the Lord of the Mark may ride. For the sire of their race was the great horse of Eorl that knew the speech of Men. Seven nights ago Shadowfax returned; but the king's anger is not less, for now the horse is wild and will let no man handle him."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“甘道夫！”伊欧墨倒吸一口冷气：“骠骑国上上下下都听过甘道夫的名号，但是，我必须警告你，他的名字不再获得骠骑王的信赖。自从我们有记忆以来，他曾经在此作客多次；有时间隔数月，有时间隔好几年，他一向都是宣告奇异事件的通报者，现在有人也把他叫作邪恶的使者。自从他去年夏天来过之后，一切都起了天惊地动的变化，从那时开始，我们和萨鲁曼之间起了猜忌。以前，我们一直把他当作盟友，但甘道夫现身，警告我们艾辛格正在备战。他声称自己被囚禁在艾辛格，好不容易才逃了出来，请求我们援助他，但希优顿王不相信他，因此他离开了。千万别在希优顿的面前提到甘道夫的名字，他会大为震怒的，因为甘道夫取走了他被称为影疾的神驹，那是洛汗国万千马匹中的顶尖之选，是只有骠骑王才能够骑乘的皇家宝马，它是吾祖伊欧能通人语的神驹之直系子孙。七天以前影疾回到我国，但国王的怒气并没有稍歇，因为那匹马现在野性难驯，不愿意让任何人骑乘它。”">查看中文翻译</div>

He came seldom to the Mark, for he was ever in the wars on the East-borders; but I have seen him. More like to the swift sons of Eorl than to the grave Men of Gondor he seemed to me, and likely to prove a great captain of his people when his time came.

Forty leagues and five you have measured ere the fourth day is ended! Hardy is the race of Elendil! But now, lord, what would you have me do! I must return in haste to Théoden. I spoke warily before my men. It is true that we are not yet at open war with the Black Land, and there are some, close to the king's ear, that speak craven counsels; but war is coming. We shall not forsake our old alliance with Gondor, and while they fight we shall aid them: so say I and all who hold with me.

<div class="line_en">"We do not and we never have," said Éomer with a flash of his eyes; "though it comes to my ears that that lie has been told. Some years ago the Lord of the Black Land wished to purchase horses of us at great price, but we refused him, for he puts beasts to evil use. Then he sent plundering Orcs, and they carry off what they can, choosing always the black horses: few of these are now left. For that reason our feud with the Orcs is bitter. But at this time our chief concern is with Saruman. He has claimed lordship over all this land, and there has been war between us for many months. He has taken Orcs into his service, and Wolf-riders, and evil Men, and he has closed the Gap against us, so that we are likely to be beset both east and west. It is ill dealing with such a foe: he is a wizard both cunning and dwimmer-crafty, having many guises. He walks here and there, they say, as an old man hooded and cloaked, very like to Gandalf, as many now recall. His spies slip through every net, and his birds of ill omen are abroad in the sky. I do not know how it will all end, and my heart misgives me; for it seems to me that his friends do not all dwell in Isengard. But if you come to the king's house, you shall see for yourself. Will you not come? Do I hope in vain that you have been sent to me for a help in doubt and need?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们不曾这样做，也永远不会！”伊欧墨眼中闪动着光芒：“不过，据传有人刻意在散布这类的谣言。几年以前，暗黑大地的君王希望能够用高价向我们购买马匹，但我们拒绝了他，因为他会将这些骏马运用在邪恶之途上。然后，他派出半兽人来劫掠，抢夺走我们不少的牲口；他们只挑黑色的马匹带走，因此，我族中已经极少有黑色的良马了，因为这样，我们和半兽人之间有着极深的仇怨。不过，这段时间，我们主要的威胁还是来自于萨鲁曼。他声称这块土地全都是他的管辖范围，我们已经和他陷入了数月之久的拉锯战。他招募半兽人、狼骑士和邪恶的人类加入他的部队，而他也封锁了我国东西两边的隘口，让我们有可能同时受到东西两方的夹击。这样的对手实在非常难缠，他是名诡计多端的巫师，拥有很强的法力和各式的伪装，据说他曾乔装成甘道夫一样的老人四处打探消息。他的间谍可以穿透天罗地网，连飞禽都在他的指挥之下打探我们的情报。我很担心，不知道这将会如何收场，因为，他的盟友似乎并不只驻扎在艾辛格。如果你们有机会来到我王的皇宫，相信你们会懂我的意思的。你们会来吗？我把你们当作是处于迷惑困境中的援军，难道我误会你们了吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Come now!" said Éomer. "The Heir of Elendil would be a strength indeed to the Sons of Eorl in this evil tide. There is battle even now upon the Westemnet, and I fear that it may go ill for us. Indeed in this riding north I went without the king's leave, for in my absence his house is left with little guard. But scouts warned me of the orc-host coming down out of the East Wall four nights ago, and among them they reported that some bore the white badges of Saruman. So suspecting what I most fear, a league between Orthanc and the Dark Tower, I led forth my éored, men of my own household; and we overtook the Orcs at nightfall two days ago, near to the borders of the Entwood. There we surrounded them, and gave battle yesterday at dawn. Fifteen of my men I lost, and twelve horses alas! For the Orcs were greater in number than we counted on. Others joined them, coming out of the East across the Great River: their trail is plain to see a little north of this spot. And others, too, came out of the forest. Great Orcs, who also bore the White Hand of Isengard: that kind is stronger and more fell than all others. Nonetheless we put an end to them. But we have been too long away. We are needed south and west. Will you not come? There are spare horses as you see. There is work for the Sword to do. Yes, and we could find a use for Gimli's axe and the bow of Legolas, if they will pardon my rash words concerning the Lady of the Wood.

Never in former days would any high lord of this land have constrained a man to abandon such a quest as mine. My duty at least is clear, to go on.

Upon a stake in the middle was set a great goblin head; upon its shattered helm the white badge could still be seen.

<div class="line_en">"If you wish to know what I think," he began again after a while, "I think it was Saruman. Who else? Remember the words of Éomer: he walks about like an old man hooded and cloaked. Those were the words. He has gone off with our horses, or scared them away, and here we are. There is more trouble coming to us, mark my words!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我认为，”他不久之后继续说道：“那是萨鲁曼。除他之外，还会有谁呢？别忘记伊欧墨的话语：他打扮成老人的模样，戴着兜帽、披着斗篷四处行走。他把我们的马匹赶走了，我们被困在这里；记住我所说的话，将来还会有更多危险的！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It seems unlikely that I shall have the chance," said Gimli.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“连马都没了，谈什么潜力！”金雳说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Feet!" said Gimli. "But we cannot eat them as well as walk on them." He threw some fuel on the fire and slumped down beside it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“还有脚！”金雳说：“可是我们又不能带它们散步、放它们去吃草！”他气冲冲地丢了几把柴火进营火中，恼怒地坐了下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Only a few hours ago you were unwilling to sit on a horse of Rohan," laughed Legolas. "You will make a rider yet."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“几小时之前，你还不愿意骑上洛汗国的骏马呢，”勒苟拉斯取笑他道：“看来你有成为骑士的潜力。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I mark them," said Aragorn. "But I marked also that this old man had a hat not a hood. Still I do not doubt that you guess right, and that we are in peril here, by night or day. Yet in the meantime there is nothing that we can do but rest, while we may. I will watch for a while now, Gimli. I have more need of thought than of sleep."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我记住了，”阿拉贡说：“但我也记得他戴的是帽子，不是什么兜帽。不过，我也觉得你说的没错，我们在这边不管白天还是黑夜都是很危险的，可是，现在我们除了把握机会休息之外，别无选择。金雳，先让我值夜吧！我现在比较需要沉思，反而不需要什么睡眠。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The night passed slowly. Legolas followed Aragorn, and Gimli followed Legolas, and their watches wore away. But nothing happened. The old man did not appear again, and the horses did not return.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这一晚过得十分缓慢，勒苟拉斯在阿拉贡之后守夜，在那之后又是金雳。不过，这一整夜什么都没有发生，老人没有再度出现，而马匹也没有回来。">查看中文翻译</div>
