<div class="line_en">"I mean," -- said he, with serious energy --"if I can, to make you hate meone degree less than you do NOW. I mean to offer some kind ofexplanation, some kind of apology, for the past; to open my whole heartto you, and by convincing you, that though I have been always ablockhead, I have not been always a rascal, to obtain something likeforgiveness from Ma-from your sister."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我的意思是，”威洛比郑重有力地说道，“如果可能的话，使你比现在少恨我一点。我想为过去作点解释，表示点歉意——把全部的心里话说给你听听，让你相信：我虽说一直是个傻瓜蛋，但并非一直都是个坏蛋——以此能取得玛一—你妹妹的某种谅解。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I do not know," said he, after a pause of expectation on her side, andthoughtfulness on his own, --"how YOU may have accounted for mybehaviour to your sister, or what diabolical motive you may haveimputed to me. -- Perhaps you will hardly think the better of me, -- it isworth the trial however, and you shall hear every thing. When I firstbecame intimate in your family, I had no other intention, no other viewin the acquaintance than to pass my time pleasantly while I was obligedto remain in Devonshire, more pleasantly than I had ever done before. Your sister's lovely person and interesting manners could not butplease me; and her behaviour to me almost from the first, was of akind-It is astonishing, when I reflect on what it was, and what SHEwas, that my heart should have been so insensible! But at first I mustconfess, my vanity only was elevated by it. Careless of her happiness, thinking only of my own amusement, giving way to feelings which I hadalways been too much in the habit of indulging, I endeavoured, by everymeans in my power, to make myself pleasing to her, without any designof returning her affection."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她期待着，只见威洛比略思片刻，然后说道：“我不知道你是如何解释我对你妹妹的行为的，把什么邪恶的动机归罪到我身上。也许你不大会瞧得起我了，不过还是值得听我说说，我要源源本本地说给你听听。我最初与你一家人结识的时候，并没有别的用心、别的意图，只想使我在德文郡的日子过得愉快些，实际上是比以往过得更愉快。你妹妹那可爱的姿容和有趣的举止不可能不引起我的喜爱。而她对我，几乎从一开始就有点——仔细想想她当时的情况，想想她那副样子，简直令人吃惊，我的心竟然那么麻木不仁！不过应该承认，我起先只是被激起了虚荣心。我不顾她的幸福，只想到自己的快活，任凭我过去一贯沉溺其中的那种感情在心里兴风作浪，于是便干方百计地去讨好她，而并不想报答她的钟情。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I insist on you hearing the whole of it," he replied, "My fortune wasnever large, and I had always been expensive, always in the habit ofassociating with people of better income than myself. Every year sincemy coming of age, or even before, I believe, had added to my debts; andthough the death of my old cousin, Mrs. Smith, was to set me free; yetthat event being uncertain, and possibly far distant, it had been forsome time my intention to re-establish my circumstances by marrying awoman of fortune. To attach myself to your sister, therefore, was nota thing to be thought of; -- and with a meanness, selfishness, cruelty-which no indignant, no contemptuous look, even of yours, MissDashwood, can ever reprobate too much-I was acting in this manner, trying to engage her regard, without a thought of returning it. -- Butone thing may be said for me: even in that horrid state of selfishvanity, I did not know the extent of the injury I meditated, because Idid not THEN know what it was to love. But have I ever known it? -- Wellmay it be doubted; for, had I really loved, could I have sacrificed myfeelings to vanity, to avarice? -- or, what is more, could I havesacrificed hers? -- But I have done it. To avoid a comparative poverty, which her affection and her society would have deprived of all itshorrors, I have, by raising myself to affluence, lost every thing thatcould make it a blessing."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我一定要你听完，”威洛比答道。“我的财产历来不多，可我一贯大手大脚，一贯爱同比自己收入多的人交往。我成年以后，甚至我想是在成年以前，欠债逐年增多。虽然我的表姑史密斯太太一去世我就会获救，但那靠不住，很可能遥遥无期，于是我一直想娶个有钱的女人，以便重振家业。因此，让我去爱你妹妹，那是不可思议的。我是这样的卑鄙、自私、残忍——对此，达什伍德小姐，即便是你，不管用多么愤慨、多么鄙夷的目光加以谴责，都不会过分——我就是采取这样的行为，一方面想赢得她的喜爱，另一方面又不想去爱她。不过，有一点可以说明一下，即使在充满自私和虚荣的可怕情况下，我也不知道我造成了多大的危害，因为我当时还不懂得什么是爱情。但是我后来懂得了吗？这很值得怀疑，因为假若我真的爱她，我会牺牲感情而去追求虚荣和贪婪吗？再说，我会牺牲她的感情吗？可是我偏偏这样做了。我一心想避免陷入相对的贫穷，其实，有了她的恩爱和友谊，贫穷一点也不可怕。如今我虽然发了财，但是我失去了可以给我带来幸福的一切东西。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"To have resisted such attractions, to have withstood suchtenderness! -- Is there a man on earth who could have done it? -- Yes, I found myself, by insensible degrees, sincerely fond of her; and the happiest hours of my life were what I spent with her when I felt myintentions were strictly honourable, and my feelings blameless. EvenTHEN, however, when fully determined on paying my addresses to her, Iallowed myself most improperly to put off, from day to day, the moment of doing it, from an unwillingness to enter into an engagement while mycircumstances were so greatly embarrassed. I will not reason here-norwill I stop for YOU to expatiate on the absurdity, and the worse thanabsurdity, of scrupling to engage my faith where my honour was already bound. The event has proved, that I was a cunning fool, providing withgreat circumspection for a possible opportunity of making myselfcontemptible and wretched for ever. At last, however, my resolution was taken, and I had determined, as soon as I could engage her alone, to justify the attentions I had so invariably paid her, and openlyassure her of an affection which I had already taken such pains to display. But in the interim-in the interim of the very few hours that were to pass, before I could have an opportunity of speaking with her in private-a circumstance occurred-an unlucky circumstance, to ruinall my resolution, and with it all my comfort. A discovery took place," -- here he hesitated and looked down. --"Mrs. Smith had somehow orother been informed, I imagine by some distant relation, whose interestit was to deprive me of her favour, of an affair, a connection-but Ineed not explain myself farther," he added, looking at her with anheightened colour and an enquiring eye --"your particular intimacy-you have probably heard the whole story long ago."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“见到这样的丰姿美貌，这样的柔情蜜意而不动心！天下有哪个男人做得到呢！是的，我不知不觉地渐渐发现我从心里喜欢她。我生平最幸福的时刻，就是同她在一起度过的。那时，我觉得自己的用心正大光明，感情无可指责。不过，即便在当时，虽说我下定决心向她求爱，但是由于我不愿意在极其窘迫的境况下与她订婚，因此便极不恰当地一天天拖延下去。在这里，我不想进行争辩——也不想停下来让你数落我多么荒唐。本来是义不容辞的事情，我却迟迟疑疑地不讲情义，真比荒唐还糟糕。事实证明，我是个狡猾的傻瓜，谨小慎微地制造机会，使自己永远成为一个不齿于人类的可怜虫。不过，我最后终于拿定主意，一有机会与她单独相会，就向她表明我一直在追求她，公开对她说我爱她。事实上，我早已在尽力设法表露这种爱。但是，在这当口——就在随后的儿个钟头里，我还没能找到机会私下同她交谈，却出现了一个情况。—一一个不幸的情况，使得我的决心、我的幸福毁于一旦。我的事情败露了，”一说到这里，他有些犹豫，不禁垂下了头。“史密斯太太不知道怎么听说了，我想是哪个远房亲戚告密的，这个亲戚一心想使我失宠于史密斯太太，便告发了我的私情，我与别人的瓜葛——但是我不需要亲自再作解释，”他补充说，面孔涨得通红，直拿探询的目光望着埃丽诺。“你和布兰登上校的关系特别亲密——你大概早就">查看中文翻译</div>

I acknowledge that her situation and hercharacter ought to have been respected by me. I do not mean to justifymyself, but at the same time cannot leave you to suppose that I havenothing to urge-that because she was injured she was irreproachable, and because I was a libertine, SHE must be a saint. If the violence ofher passions, the weakness of her understanding-I do not mean, however, to defend myself. Her affection for me deserved bettertreatment, and I often, with great self-reproach, recall the tendernesswhich, for a very short time, had the power of creating any return. Iwish-I heartily wish it had never been.

<div class="line_en">"She taxed me with the offence at once, and my confusion may beguessed. The purity of her life, the formality of her notions, herignorance of the world-every thing was against me. The matter itselfI could not deny, and vain was every endeavour to soften it. She waspreviously disposed, I believe, to doubt the morality of my conduct ingeneral, and was moreover discontented with the very little attention, the very little portion of my time that I had bestowed on her, in mypresent visit. In short, it ended in a total breach. By one measure Imight have saved myself. In the height of her morality, good woman! she offered to forgive the past, if I would marry Eliza. That couldnot be-and I was formally dismissed from her favour and her house. The night following this affair-I was to go the next morning-wasspent by me in deliberating on what my future conduct should be. Thestruggle was great-but it ended too soon. My affection for Marianne, my thorough conviction of her attachment to me-it was all insufficientto outweigh that dread of poverty, or get the better of those falseideas of the necessity of riches, which I was naturally inclined tofeel, and expensive society had increased. I had reason to believemyself secure of my present wife, if I chose to address her, and Ipersuaded myself to think that nothing else in common prudence remainedfor me to do. A heavy scene however awaited me, before I could leaveDevonshire; -- I was engaged to dine with you on that very day; someapology was therefore necessary for my breaking this engagement. Butwhether I should write this apology, or deliver it in person, was apoint of long debate.

She read what made her wretched. Her wretchedness I could haveborne, but her passion-her malice-At all events it must be appeased.

<div class="line_en">"Last night, in Drury Lane lobby, I ran against Sir John Middleton, andwhen he saw who I was-for the first time these two months-he spoke tome. -- That he had cut me ever since my marriage, I had seen withoutsurprise or resentment. Now, however, his good-natured, honest, stupidsoul, full of indignation against me, and concern for your sister, could not resist the temptation of telling me what he knew oughtto-though probably he did not think it WOULD-vex me horridly. Asbluntly as he could speak it, therefore, he told me that MarianneDashwood was dying of a putrid fever at Cleveland-a letter thatmorning received from Mrs. Jennings declared her danger mostimminent-the Palmers are all gone off in a fright, &amp;c. -- I was too muchshocked to be able to pass myself off as insensible even to theundiscerning Sir John. His heart was softened in seeing mine suffer; and so much of his ill-will was done away, that when we parted, healmost shook me by the hand while he reminded me of an old promiseabout a pointer puppy. What I felt on hearing that your sister wasdying-and dying too, believing me the greatest villain upon earth, scorning, hating me in her latest moments-for how could I tell whathorrid projects might not have been imputed? ONE person I was surewould represent me as capable of any thing -- What I felt wasdreadful! -- My resolution was soon made, and at eight o'clock thismorning I was in my carriage. Now you know all."</div>

<div class="line_en">Elinor made no answer. Her thoughts were silently fixed on theirreparable injury which too early an independence and its consequenthabits of idleness, dissipation, and luxury, had made in the mind, thecharacter, the happiness, of a man who, to every advantage of personand talents, united a disposition naturally open and honest, and afeeling, affectionate temper. The world had made him extravagant andvain-Extravagance and vanity had made him cold-hearted and selfish. Vanity, while seeking its own guilty triumph at the expense of another, had involved him in a real attachment, which extravagance, or at leastits offspring, necessity, had required to be sacrificed. Each faultypropensity in leading him to evil, had led him likewise to punishment. The attachment, from which against honour, against feeling, againstevery better interest he had outwardly torn himself, now, when nolonger allowable, governed every thought; and the connection, for thesake of which he had, with little scruple, left her sister to misery, was likely to prove a source of unhappiness to himself of a far moreincurable nature. From a reverie of this kind she was recalled at theend of some minutes by Willoughby, who, rousing himself from a reverieat least equally painful, started up in preparation for going, and said --</div>
