<div class="line_en">Harry got to his feet, trod on the hem of his robes, and stumbled slightly. He set off up the gap between the Gryffindor and Hufflepuff tables. It felt like an immensely long walk; the top table didn't seem to be getting any nearer at all, and he could feel hundreds and hundreds of eyes upon him, as though each were a searchlight. The buzzing grew louder and louder. After what seemed like an hour, he was right in front of Dumbledore, feeling the stares of all the teachers upon him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利站了起来，踩在长袍的底边上，微微绊了一下。他顺着格兰芬多和赫奇帕奇的桌子之间的通道往前走。他觉得这条路似乎格外漫长，主宾席似乎永远是那么遥不可及。他可以感觉到成百上千双眼睛都盯在自己身上，似乎每只眼睛都不能是一盏探照灯。嗡嗡的议论声越来越响了。仿佛过了整整一小时，他才终于走到邓布利多面前，他感到所有教师的目光都盯住了他。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry moved off along the teachers' table. Hagrid was seated right at the end. He did not wink at Harry, or wave, or give any of his usual signs of greeting. He looked completely astonished and stared at Harry as he passed like everyone else. Harry went through the door out of the Great Hall and found himself in a smaller room, lined with paintings of witches and wizards. A handsome fire was roaring in the fireplace opposite him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利顺着教工桌子走过去。海格坐在最边上，他没有朝哈利眨眼睛、挥手，或像平常那样打一个招呼。他似乎完全怔住了，只是和别人一样呆呆地望着哈利走过。哈利穿过那扇门，出了礼堂，发现自己来到了一个小房间里，两边的墙上都挂着巫师的画像。在他对面的壁炉里，炉火燃得正旺。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The faces in the portraits turned to look at him as he entered. He saw a wizened witch flit out of the frame of her picture and into the one next to it, which contained a wizard with a walrus mustache. The wizened witch started whispering in his ear.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他进去时，肖像上的那些面孔全都转过来望着他。他看见一个皱巴巴的女巫嗖地逃出自己的像框，钻进了旁边的像框，那上面是一个留着海象胡须的男巫。皱巴巴的女巫开始悄悄地对他咬起了耳朵。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Viktor Krum, Cedric Diggory, and Fleur Delacour were grouped around the fire. They looked strangely impressive, silhouetted against the flames. Krum, hunched-up and brooding, was leaning against the mantelpiece, slightly apart from the other two. Cedric was standing with his hands behind his back, staring into the fire. Fleur Delacour looked around when Harry walked in and threw back her sheet of long, silvery hair.</div>

<div class="line_en">But nobody wanted to hear that he wasn't hungry; nobody wanted to hear that he hadn't put his name in the goblet; not one single person seemed to have noticed that he wasn't at all in the mood to celebrate… Lee Jordan had unearthed a Gryffindor banner from somewhere, and he insisted on draping it around Harry like a cloak. Harry couldn't get away; whenever he tried to sidle over to the staircase up to the dormitories, the crowd around him closed ranks, forcing another butterbeer on him, stuffing crisps and peanuts into his hands… Everyone wanted to know how he had done it, how he had tricked Dumbledore's Age Line and managed to get his name into the goblet…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是没有人愿意听他说他不饿，没有人愿意听他说他没有把名字投进高脚杯，似乎谁也没有注意到他根本就没有情绪庆祝这件事…李·乔丹不知从什么地方翻腾出一面格兰芬多学院的旗子，坚持要把它像斗篷一样裹在哈利身上。哈利没有办法脱身，每当他想偷偷溜向通往宿舍的楼梯时，人群就向他靠拢，把他团团围住，强迫他再喝一杯黄油啤酒，或把饼干和花生硬塞进他手里…每个人都想知道他是怎么办成的，他是怎么骗过邓布利多的年龄线，把他的名字投进高脚杯的…">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">To his great relief, he found Ron was lying on his bed in the otherwise empty dormitory, still fully dressed. He looked up when Harry slammed the door behind him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="令他大为宽慰的是，他发现罗恩和衣躺在床上，宿舍里只有他一个人。哈利把门重重关上时，罗恩抬起头来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He wanted more than anything to find Ron and Hermione, to find a bit of sanity, but neither of them seemed to be in the common room. Insisting that he needed to sleep, and almost flattening the little Creevey brothers as they attempted to waylay him at the foot of the stairs, Harry managed to shake everyone off and climb up to the dormitory as fast as he could.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他特别希望看到罗恩和赫敏，希望找到一点儿理智，可是他俩似乎都不在公共休息室里。哈利一再坚持自己需要睡觉了，差点儿把试图在楼梯口拦截他的克里维小兄弟俩撞倒在地。最后他总算摆脱了众人，匆匆上楼来到宿舍。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Where've you been?" Harry said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你上哪儿去了？”哈利说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was grinning, but it was a very odd, strained sort of grin. Harry suddenly became aware that he was still wearing the scarlet Gryffindor banner that Lee had tied around him. He hastened to take it off, but it was knotted very tightly. Ron lay on the bed without moving, watching Harry struggle to remove it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="罗恩脸上笑着，但那是一种非常别扭、勉强的笑容。哈利突然意识到自己还披着李·乔丹刚才系在他身上的鲜红色的格兰花多旗子。他想赶紧把它脱掉，可是那个结系得很紧。罗恩一动不动地躺在床上，看着哈利费力地解开旗子。">查看中文翻译</div>
