<div class="line_en">While his proper cup of coffee was brewing, he put on his navy blue trousers and jacket, stepped into his wooden clogs, and shoved his hands in his pockets in that particular way of a middle-aged man who expects the worthless world outside to disappoint him.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ove had, as usual, gotten up ten minutes earlier. He could not make head nor tail of people who overslept and blamed it on "the alarm clock not ringing." Ove had never owned an alarm clock in his entire life. He woke up at quarter to six and that was when he got up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维像往常一样早起了十分钟。他无法理解那些睡过头还责怪“闹钟没有响”的人。欧维一辈子都没上过一个闹钟。六点差一刻，他准时醒来，然后直接起床。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Every morning for the almost four decades they had lived in this house, Ove had put on the coffee percolator, using exactly the same amount of coffee as on any other morning, and then drank a cup with his wife. One measure for each cup, and one extra for the pot -- no more, no less. People didn't know how to do that anymore, brew some proper coffee. In the same way as nowadays nobody could write with a pen. Because now it was all computers and espresso machines. And where was the world going if people couldn't even write or brew a pot of coffee?</div>

<div class="line_en">"Scram!" Ove bellowed, so abruptly that the cat jumped back. It briefly scrutinized the fifty-nine-year-old man and his clogs, then turned and lolloped off. Ove could have sworn it rolled its eyes before clearing out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“去！”欧维突然大喝一声，猫咪吓一大“跳”。它后退一步。眼睛紧盯着这个五十九岁的男人和他的木屐。然后它转过身轻轻一跃，缓步离开。欧维心里最清楚，他敢打赌这家伙先翻了个白眼。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then he made his morning inspection of the street. The surrounding row houses lay in silence and darkness as he walked out the door, and there wasn't a soul in sight. Might have known, thought Ove. On this street no one took the trouble to get up any earlier than they had to. Nowadays, it was just self-employed people and other disreputable sorts living here.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他迈步经过那些坐落在寂静与黑暗中的排屋门口。早就料到了。这个小区里，不到点儿是不会有人愿意提早出门的，这个欧维心里有数。如今，这片住的不是自由职业者就是别的什么游手好闲的人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The cat sat with a nonchalant expression in the middle of the footpath that ran between the houses. It had half a tail and only one ear. Patches of fur were missing here and there as if someone had pulled it out in handfuls. Not a very impressive feline.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="猫咪一脸漠然地杵在房子之间的过道上。话说这猫也没个猫模样。它只有半截尾巴、一只耳朵，身上的毛还东少一块西缺一块的，就像被谁一把一把揪过似的。其实很难算是一只完整的猫科动物，欧维想。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ove stomped forward. The cat stood up. Ove stopped. They stood there measuring up to each other for a few moments, like two potential troublemakers in a small-town bar. Ove considered throwing one of his clogs at it. The cat looked as if it regretted not bringing its own clogs to lob back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他向前跺了两下脚。猫咪站起身。欧维站住。两位这么互相打量片刻，就像夜晚乡村酒吧里两个暗中较劲的打手。欧维寻思着要不要朝它砸个木屐什么的。猫咪一脸晦气，心想没有木屐给他抽回去。">查看中文翻译</div>

</div>
<div class="line_en">Pest, he thought, glancing at his watch. Two minutes to six. Time to get going or the bloody cat would have succeeded in delaying the entire inspection. Fine state of affairs that would be.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“妖孽。”他想着，瞄了一眼腕表。六点零二分。时间飞逝，可不能让任何猫科动物耽误了整个巡逻。本来都好好的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After this, he detoured through the guest parking area, where cars could only be left for up to twenty-four hours. Carefully he noted down all the license numbers in the little pad he kept in his jacket pocket, and then compared these to the licenses he had noted down the day before. On occasions when the same license numbers turned up in Ove's notepad, Ove would go home and call the Vehicle Licensing Authority to retrieve the vehicle owner's details, after which he'd call up the latter and inform him that he was a useless bloody imbecile who couldn't even read signs. Ove didn't really care who was parked in the guest parking area, of course. But it was a question of principle. If it said twenty-four hours on the sign, that's how long you were allowed to stay. What would it be like if everyone just parked wherever they liked? It would be chaos. There'd be cars bloody everywhere.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="之后他到访客停车场绕了一圈，那儿最多只允许停满二十四个小时，他从外套口袋里掏出小本儿仔细记下所有车牌号。跟前一天记过的车牌号核对了一遍。哪回要是同样的车牌号在欧维的笔记本上连着出现两天，他就照老规矩回家给交管局打电话要来车主的个人信息，然后打电话通知肇事者，说对方是个没用无脑的畜生，连瑞典语标牌都看不懂。其实并不是因为欧维有多在乎访客停车位里停着谁的车。当然不是。而是因为这是原则。标牌上写着二十四小时就得服从。因为要是大家都整天想停哪儿就停哪儿会怎么样？肯定就乱套了，这个欧维当然明白——那就满地都是车了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He began marching along the footpath between the houses. He stopped by the traffic sign informing motorists that they were prohibited from entering the residential area. He gave the metal pole a firm kick. Not that it was wonky or anything, but it's always best to check. Ove is the sort of man who checks the status of all things by giving them a good kick.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是他沿着房子之间的过道朝停车场走去，就像他每天早晨做的一样。他在标明“社区内禁止车辆通行”的标牌前站住，狠狠地踹了一脚固定警示牌的底座。并不是因为它歪了什么的，但检查一下总没坏处。欧维就是那种靠踹两脚来检查东西的人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He walked across the parking area and strolled back and forth along all the garages to make sure none of them had been burgled in the night or set on fire by gangs of vandals. Such things had never happened around here, but then Ove had never skipped one of his inspections either. He tugged three times at the door handle of his own garage, where his Saab was parked. Just like any other morning.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着他走进停车场，踱步经过一个又一个车库，检查确认晚上有没有人擅闯，或有没有什么破坏分子前来纵火。之前小区里也从来没有发生过这种事。但反正欧维的巡逻也从来没有间断过哪怕一次。他检查了自己车库的门把手，里面停着他的萨博。上下三次，每天早晨都这样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He kicked the bins a bit, swore, and fished out a jar from the glass recycling, mumbled something about "incompetents" as he unscrewed its metal lid. He dropped the jar back into glass recycling, and the metal lid into the metal recycling bin.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他轻踹了一脚垃圾箱。咒骂一声，并从玻璃回收箱中拣出一个玻璃瓶来，边念叨着什么“没用的东西”，边拧下瓶子上的金属瓶盖。把玻璃瓶扔回玻璃回收箱里，然后把金属瓶盖扔进金属回收箱。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Back when Ove was the chairman of the Residents' Association, he'd pushed hard to have surveillance cameras installed so they could monitor the trash room and stop people tossing out unauthorized trash. To Ove's great annoyance, his proposal was voted out. The neighbors felt "slightly uneasy" about it; plus they felt it would be a headache archiving all the videotapes. This, in spite of Ove repeatedly arguing that those with "honest intentions" had nothing to fear from "the truth."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当年欧维还是社区委员会会长的时候，他曾大力提倡在垃圾房里安装摄像头来监控，确保无人倾倒“非法垃圾”。建议被否决让欧维非常气恼，大部分邻居都觉得这么做让人“不大舒服”，另外这么多录像带整理起来相当棘手。尽管欧维再三重申“脚正不怕鞋子歪，身正不怕影子斜”。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Today, thank goodness, there weren't any unauthorized cars in the guest parking, and Ove was able to proceed to the next part of his daily inspection: the trash room. Not that it was really his responsibility, mind. He had steadfastly opposed from the very beginning the nonsense steamrollered through by the recently arrived jeep-brigade that household trash "had to be separated." Having said that, once the decision was made to sort the trash, someone had to ensure that it was actually being done. Not that anyone had asked Ove to do it, but if men like Ove didn't take the initiative there'd be anarchy. There'd be bags of trash all over the place.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是今天访客停车场里没有不守规矩的车辆，于是欧维收起笔记本像往常一样拐进垃圾房。这其实也不是他想管的事，他本来一开始就高调反对那些开着吉普车新搬来的社区委员们提出的狗屁方案：垃圾必须分类。但既然现在已经决定了要分类，那就得有人来检查落实。也并不是有谁给欧维派了任务，但如果像欧维这样的人都不自觉自愿地挑起这副担子，这社会得乱成什么样子。这个欧维是知道的——那就满地都是垃圾了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And that was because Ove did not trust the Internet. He accentuated the net even though his wife nagged that you had to put the emphasis on Inter. The steering group realized soon enough that the Internet would watch Ove throwing out his trash over Ove's own dead body. And in the end no cameras were installed. Just as well, Ove reasoned. The daily inspection was more effective anyway. You knew who was doing what and who was keeping things under control. Anyone with half a brain could see the sense of it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维明确表示信不过互联网。他把互联网念作“互联网儿”，还故意把“网”字加重了念，尽管他的夫人一再提醒他“互联”才是关键。会长很快意识到，要想让互联网看着欧维倒垃圾，除非先送他进棺材。摄像头还是没有装成。挺好，欧维想。每天巡个逻不是更好嘛。这样大家就知道谁都干了啥操的什么心。是个人就明白这道理。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Two years later, after Ove had been deposed as chairman of the Association (a betrayal Ove subsequently referred to as "the coup d'état"), the question came up again. The new steering group explained snappily to the residents that there was a newfangled camera available, activated by movement sensors, which sent the footage directly to the Internet. With the help of such a camera one could monitor not only the trash room but also the parking area, thereby preventing vandalism and burglaries. Even better, the video material erased itself automatically after twenty-four hours, thus avoiding any "breaches of the residents' right to privacy." A unanimous decision was required to go ahead with the installation. Only one member voted against.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两年后，当时委员会已经撤了欧维的职（欧维后来自称这是一起“政变”），这个问题重被提起。显然市面上出现了一种新型摄像头，由移动感应装置自动开启并直接将图像上传互联网，新的委员会会长给小区里的每个人都发了一封洋洋洒洒的信，对上述摄像装置作了详尽的解释。有了这个摄像头，不但可以监控垃圾房，还能捎上停车场，防偷盗、防流氓。另外影像资料二十四小时后自动删除，不至于“侵犯居民隐私权”。要安装摄像头必须委员们全票通过，但还是有一个委员投了反对票。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ove walked down the little footpath between the houses. He stopped outside his own house, stooped over the paving stones, and sniffed vehemently along the cracks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后欧维沿着房子之间的小过道回到自己的家门口，朝水泥地弯下腰，使劲闻了闻拼缝处。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He tore down the angry notice from the wall. He would have liked to propose to the steering committee that a proper "No Leafleting" sign should be put up on this wall. People nowadays seemed to think they could swan around with angry signs here, there, and anywhere they liked. This was a wall, not a bloody notice board.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后他撕掉墙上那张愤怒的小纸条。他很想提议委员会在这堵墙上竖块“禁止贴条”的牌子。如今的人显然自以为可以到处转悠着满大街贴愤怒小纸条。这堵墙他妈的又不是什么布告栏。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When he'd finished his inspection of the trash room he locked the door, just as he did every morning, and gave it three good tugs to ensure it was closed properly. Then he turned around and noticed a bicycle leaning up against the wall outside the bike shed. Even though there was a huge sign instructing residents not to leave their bicycles there. Right next to it one of the neighbors had taped up an angry, handwritten note: "This is not a bicycle parking area! Learn to read signs!" Ove muttered something about ineffectual idiots, opened the bike shed, picked up the bicycle, put it neatly inside, then locked the shed and tugged the door handle three times.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="完成垃圾房的检视之后，他锁上门，正如每个早晨一样，猛推三下以作检查。然后他转过身，发现一辆自行车靠墙停在自行车棚之外。尽管就在它头顶上一目了然地竖着一块“禁止停放自行车”的标牌。自行车旁，别的邻居已经贴了一张愤怒的纸条，手写着：“这里不是自行车棚！看清标牌！”欧维咬牙念了声“白痴”，打开自行车棚的栅栏，抬起那辆自行车，按着队形对齐摆好。锁上栅栏，猛推三下。">查看中文翻译</div>

The forty-year-old beard-stubbled poser from the house across the street comes jogging past. Anders is his name, apparently. A recent arrival, probably not lived here for more than four or five years at most. Already he's managed to wheedle his way onto the steering group of the Residents' Association. The snake. He thinks he owns the street. Moved in after his divorce, apparently, paid well over the market value. Typical of these bastards, they come here and push up the property prices for honest people. As if this was some sort of upper-class area. Also drives an Audi, Ove has noticed. He might have known. Self-employed people and other idiots all drive Audis.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ove tucks his hands into his pockets. He directs a slightly imperious kick at the baseboard. This row house is slightly too big for Ove and his wife, really, he can just about admit that. But it's all paid for. There's not a penny left in loans. Which is certainly more than one could say for the clotheshorse. It's all loans nowadays; everyone knows the way people carry on. Ove has paid his mortgage. Done his duty. Gone to work. Never taken a day of sick leave. Shouldered his share of the burden. Taken a bit of responsibility. No one does that anymore, no one takes responsibility. Now it's just computers and consultants and council bigwigs going to strip clubs and selling apartment leases under the table. Tax havens and share portfolios. No one wants to work.

Suddenly he's a bloody "generation." Because nowadays people are all thirty-one and wear too-tight trousers and no longer drink normal coffee. And don't want to take responsibility.

What he can't understand is why they have to make such a big thing of it. With those smug smiles on their faces, as if they were out there curing pulmonary emphysema. Either they walk fast or they run slowly, that's what joggers do. It's a forty-year-old man's way of telling the world that he can't do anything right. Is it really necessary to dress up as a fourteen-year-old Romanian gymnast in order to be able to do it? Or the Olympic tobogganing team?

<div class="line_en">He looks out the window at the identical house opposite. A family with children has just moved in there. Foreigners, apparently. He doesn't know yet what sort of car they have. Probably something Japanese, God help them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他透过窗户望着对面一模一样的房子。显然最近那里搬来一户有孩子的人家。外国人，欧维知道的。他不知道他们开的什么车。反正希望不是奥迪，或者更糟：日本车。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In a few days there'll be some stuck-up real estate agent standing here with a tie knot as big as a baby's head, banging on about "renovation potential" and "spatial efficiency," and he'll have all sorts of opinions about Ove, the bastard. But he won't be able to say a word about Ove's hook.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="几天后将会有个纨绔的房产商站在这儿，戴着婴儿脑袋大小的领结，张嘴就是“改建潜力”和“空间利用率”，他肯定会对欧维发表很多意见，那个浑蛋，但对欧维的钩子只字不提。这是必须做到的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ove nods to himself, as if he just said something which he very much agrees with. Looks up at the living room ceiling. He's going to put up a hook there today. And he doesn't mean any kind of hook. Every IT consultant trumpeting some data-code diagnosis and wearing one of those non-gender-specific cardigans they all have to wear these days would put up a hook any old way. But Ove's hook is going to be as solid as a rock. He's going to screw it in so hard that when the house is demolished it'll be the last thing standing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维自顾点点头，就像他刚说出了什么憋了很久的话。抬头看看客厅的天花板。今天他要在上面装个钩子。可不是随便什么钩子。要是换个满嘴代码、穿烂大街的中性针织衫的IT顾问准会装个普通的蹩脚钩子。但欧维的钩子一定得像岩石一样坚固。他想着钩子得结实，到把这破房子拆掉的时候，钩子应该是那个屹立到最后的构件。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ove has a whole drawer in his useful-stuff box just for concrete-wall anchor bolts. He stands there looking at them as if they were chess pieces. He doesn't stress about decisions concerning anchor bolts for concrete. Things have to take their time. Every anchor bolt is a process; every anchor bolt has its own use. People have no respect for decent, honest functionality anymore, they're happy as long as everything looks neat and dandy on the computer. But Ove does things the way they're supposed to be done.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在欧维的“实用”箱里有一整个匣子都是混凝土专用膨胀螺栓。他站在那儿瞪着它们就像瞪着一堆象棋棋子。他不喜欢急急忙忙地挑选混凝土螺栓。怎么也得花点时间。选螺栓是个过程，每个螺栓都有自己的使用范围。人们对具有普遍性的功能主义已经失去了应有的尊重，如今一切都必须时髦，必须数字化，但欧维还是一步一个脚印。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On the floor in the living room is one of Ove's "useful-stuff" boxes. That's how they divide up the house. All the things Ove's wife has bought are "lovely" or "homey." Everything Ove buys is useful. Stuff with a function. He keeps them in two different boxes, one big and one small. This is the small one. Full of screws and nails and wrench sets and that sort of thing. People don't have useful things anymore. People just have shit. Twenty pairs of shoes but they never know where the shoehorn is; houses filled with microwave ovens and flat-screen televisions, yet they couldn't tell you which anchor bolt to use for a concrete wall if you threatened them with a box cutter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="客厅的地板上放着欧维的小“实用”箱。房子里的东西就是这么归类的。所有欧维太太买的物品都可以贴“好看”或者“可爱”的标签。而所有欧维买的东西都很实用。那些有功用的东西。他把它们分放在两个不同的盒子里，一大一小两个“实用”箱。这是小的那个。里边是螺丝、钉子和扳手之类的玩意儿。人们对实用已经没什么概念了。现在大家只收蹩脚货。家里二十多双鞋却不知道鞋拔子为何物。屋子里塞满微波炉和平板电视，但就算被人用匕首指着也说不出混凝土墙该用什么样的膨胀螺栓。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It'll be good for you to slow down a bit," they'd drawled. Slow down? What did they know about waking up on a Tuesday and no longer having a purpose? With their Internets and their espresso coffees, what did they know about taking a bit of responsibility for things?</div>

<div class="line_en">And while he stands there immersed in the importance of it, he's mercilessly interrupted by a long scraping sound. Not at all unlike the type of sound created by a big oaf backing up a Japanese car hooked up to a trailer and scraping it against the exterior wall of Ove's house.</div>
