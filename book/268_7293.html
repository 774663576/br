<div class="line_en">My mother drove me to the airport with the windows rolled down. It was seventy-five degrees in Phoenix, the sky a perfect, cloudless blue. I was wearing my favorite shirt -- sleeveless, white eyelet lace; I was wearing it as a farewell gesture. My carry-on item was a parka.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the Olympic Peninsula of northwest Washington State, a small town named Forks exists under a near-constant cover of clouds. It rains on this inconsequential town more than any other place in the United States of America. It was from this town and its gloomy, omnipresent shade that my mother escaped with me when I was only a few months old. It was in this town that I'd been compelled to spend a month every summer until I was fourteen. That was the year I finally put my foot down; these past three summers, my dad, Charlie, vacationed with me in California for two weeks instead.</div>

<div class="line_en">Charlie was waiting for me with the cruiser. This I was expecting, too. Charlie is Police Chief Swan to the good people of Forks.

Those were the only kind of days their marriage had -- the early ones. There, parked on the street in front of the house that never changed, was my new -- well, new to me -- truck. It was a faded red color, with big, rounded fenders and a bulbous cab. To my intense surprise, I loved it. I didn't know if it would run, but I could see myself in it. Plus, it was one of those solid iron affairs that never gets damaged -- the kind you see at the scene of an accident, paint unscratched, surrounded by the pieces of the foreign car it had destroyed.</div>

It was nice to be alone, not to have to smile and look pleased; a relief to stare dejectedly out the window at the sheeting rain and let just a few tears escape. I wasn't in the mood to go on a real crying jag. I would save that for bedtime, when I would have to think about the coming morning.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="查理最大的优点之一就是爽快。他让我自己整理行李，这要是换了我母亲，是万万不可能的事情。一个人待着真好，不必面露微笑让自己看起来很愉快；沮丧地凝视着窗外如注的大雨，掉几滴眼泪是一种解脱。我没有痛痛快快大哭一场的心境，我会把它留到睡觉的时候，因为那个时候，我将不得不想一想来日的早上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We walked to class together; he was a chatterer -- he supplied most of the conversation, which made it easy for me. He'd lived in California till he was ten, so he knew how I felt about the sun. It turned out he was in my English class also. He was the nicest person I'd met today.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们一起向上课的地方走去；他是个话匣子——主要是他讲我听，这让我感到很轻松。他十岁以前住在加利福尼亚，所以他能理解我对阳光的感受。后来才知道，他跟我英语课也是同班。他是我今天遇到的最好的人了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I just couldn't believe that this was about me. It had to be something else, something that happened before I entered the Biology room.

<div class="line_en">Edward Cullen stood at the desk in front of me. I recognized again that tousled bronze hair. He didn't appear to notice the sound of my entrance. I stood pressed against the back wall, waiting for the receptionist to be free.</div>

<div class="line_en">The door opened again, and the cold wind suddenly gusted through the room, rustling the papers on the desk, swirling my hair around my face. The girl who came in merely stepped to the desk, placed a note in the wire basket, and walked out again. But Edward Cullen's back stiffened, and he turned slowly to glare at me -- his face was absurdly handsome -- with piercing, hate-filled eyes. For an instant, I felt a thrill of genuine fear, raising the hair on my arms. The look only lasted a second, but it chilled me more than the freezing wind. He turned back to the receptionist.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="门又开了，冷风突然灌了进来，把桌上的报纸刮得沙沙作响，吹散了我的头发，纷乱地贴在我的脸上。进来的女生只不过是走到桌边，往铁筐里放了一张纸条就又出去了。可爱德华·卡伦的背都僵直了，接着他慢慢地扭过头来瞪了我一眼——他的脸漂亮得不可思议——锐利的目光里充满了仇恨。刹那间，我感到了一阵真正的恐惧，胳膊上的汗毛都竖起来了。他只瞪了我一秒钟，可这一瞪比刚才那阵刺骨的寒风，还要令我感到寒冷。他把头又扭回去，面向接待员了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When I got to the truck, it was almost the last car in the lot. It seemed like a haven, already the closest thing to home I had in this damp green hole. I sat inside for a while, just staring out the windshield blankly. But soon I was cold enough to need the heater, so I turned the key and the engine roared to life. I headed back to Charlie's house, fighting tears the whole way there.</div>
