<div class="line_en">He sighed, putting the thoughts aside. There'd be time for self-recrimination later. He hadn't expected to end up here, but here he was, and kicking himself for lack of foresight wasn't going to change anything. Besides, there was too much to do.</div>

<div class="line_en">After Jill and Barry went their separate ways, Wesker stayed crouched on the balcony in the main hall, thinking. He knew that time was of the essence, but he wanted to outline a few possible scenarios before he acted; he'd already made mistakes, and didn't want to make any more of them. The Raccoon Alphas were a bright group, making his margin for error very slim indeed.</div>

<div class="line_en">He'd received his orders a couple of days ago, but hadn't expected to be in a position to carry them out so soon; the Bravo team's 'copter going down had been a fluke, as had Brad Vickers's sudden display of cowardice. Still, he should have been more prepared.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽然威斯克是在今天前接受到的命令，但是从没想过这么早地出动小队成员，Bravo小队的直升机坠毁事件完全是偶然的产物。同样，布拉德·维克斯突然驾驶直升机离去也是自己意料之外的事。早知道会发生这种事，就应该事先做更充足的准备。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He knew the grounds of the estate fairly well and the labs like the back of his hand, but he'd only been inside the mansion a few times and not at all since he'd been "officially" transferred to Raccoon City.</div>

<div class="line_en">The place was a maze, designed by a genius architect at the bidding of a madman. Spencer was bats, no two ways about it, and he'd had the house built with all kinds of tricky little mechanisms, a lot of that silly spy crap that had been so popular in the late sixties…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这幢别墅变成了一个巨大的迷宫，是那个拥有疯子一般思维的天才建筑家所设计的。斯宾塞的脑袋有些不正常，这件事获得了社会上的一致公认。这幢别墅凝结了他很多的心思，虽然那些巧妙地构造都源自于六十年代后半期所流行的间谍电影中的素材…">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Spy crap that's going to make this job twice as hard as it needs to be. Hidden keys, secret tunnels -- it's like I'm trapped in an espionage thriller, complete with mad scientists and a ticking clock.</div>

<div class="line_en">His original plan had been to lead both the Alpha and Bravo teams to the estate and clear the area before he proceeded to the lower labs and wrapped things up. He had the master keys and codes, of course; they had been sent along with his orders, and would open most of the doors on the estate. The problem was, there was no key to the door that led to the garden, it had a puzzle lock and was currently the only way to get to the labs, outside of walking through the woods.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“原本的计划是，在我前往地下研究所解决那些事情之前，将Alpha和Bravo小队一起带到这块私有领地，进而对周边以及别墅内部进行搜索。当然，我拿着那把钥匙，而且还知道密码，小队的成员也会按照我的命令行动。”问题是那扇通往庭院的门是没有钥匙的，那是一个特殊的密码锁。而眼下，那是通往研究所的惟一的一扇门，因为除此之外的方法就是穿过森林去到那个地方。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dees had been no exception, although he had managed to hold out longer than most of the others; something to do with individual metabolism, or so Wesker'd been told. The company had already decided to call a complete wipe, though the babbling scientist had been assured that help was on the way.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="说到之所以会比其他研究人员坚持的时间要长，迪斯并不是一个例外，那只不过单纯是个人的新陈代谢问题而已。而公司方面已经决定要将事实完美地抹消掉，虽然那群幼稚的科学家依然坚信会有人来救他们。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Wesker shuddered, remembering the incident with the rookie guard who'd gotten too close to one of the cages, a year or so back. The kid had been dead before he could even open his mouth to call for help. Wesker had no intention of going back outside without an army to back him up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="威斯克浑身一震，回想起一年前一位新的警备员无意中靠近笼子时所发生的事情。那个小伙子在喊出救命之前，就被撕成了两半。如果没有军队做后援的话，任何人都不希望让它回到外界。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The last contact with the estate had been over six weeks ago, an hysterical call from Michael Dees to one of the suits in the White office. The doctor had sealed the mansion, hiding the four pieces of the puzzle lock in a fruitless effort to keep any more of the virus carriers from reaching the house. By then, they were all infected and suffering from a kind of paranoid mania, one of the more charming side effects of the virus. God only knew what tricks and traps the researchers down in the labs had screwed with as they slowly lost their minds.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="自己与这块斯宾塞私有领地所作的最后接触，是在六周以前。白色办公室的一些高层领导人之一麦克·迪斯突然打来电话。迪斯博士已经将别墅封锁起来，并试图将病毒的携带者封闭在别墅的领地之内，他还将拼图式的密码锁所必须的四枚徽章藏了起来。到这时为止，他们这些人已经感染了病毒，并且患上了偏执症状，这也是病毒所产生的一种副作用。当地下研究所的研究员们逐渐丧失正常的意识，这种奇妙的机关与圈套到底会对他们产生什么样的影响，大概只有上帝才知道了…">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Wesker had enjoyed a good laugh over that one. There was no way the White boys would risk further infection. They'd sat on their hands for almost two months while Raccoon suffered the consequences, letting the incompetent RPD investigate while the virus gradually lost its punch and then sent him in to clean up the mess. Which by now was considerable.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="威斯克得知此事之后发出了一阵大笑。自己怎么可能冒着被感染的危险去救那群注定要死的人呢。他们在这两个月的时间里，对研究所发生的事情始终抱着袖手旁观的态度，在病毒威力减弱的期间，才将调查工作委托给无能的浣熊市警察。最后终于派出了威斯克。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The captain absently ran his fingers across the plush carpet, trying to remember details of the briefing about Dees's call. Whether he liked it or not, everything had to be taken care of tonight. He had to collect the required evidence and get to the labs, and that meant finding the pieces of the puzzle lock. Dees had been mostly incoherent, ranting about murderous crows and giant spiders, but he had insisted that the crest-keys to the puzzle lock were "hidden where only Spencer could find them," and that made sense.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="威斯克队长此刻漫不经心地走在豪华的地毯上，心里正在回忆自己与迪斯在那通电话里谈论的详细内容。他目前唯一的心愿，就是所有的事情都必须在今天晚上解决。将对方要求的证据收回、侵入研究所。也就是说要把那四枚能够打开密码锁的徽章找到。迪斯几乎已经陷入神经错乱的状态，会经常说出类似杀人的乌鸦，或者巨大的蜘蛛之类的疯疯癫癫的话…但是他也指出能够开锁的那四枚徽章藏在“只有斯宾塞才能找到的地方”，这句话似乎还是可信的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Everyone who worked in the house knew about Spencer's penchant for cloak-and-dagger mechanisms. Unfortunately for Wesker, he hadn't bothered learning much about the mansion, since he never thought he'd need the information. He remembered a few of the more colorful hiding places -- the statue of the tiger with mismatched eyes came to mind, as did the armor display room with the gas and the secret room in the library…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因为斯宾塞对于间谍道具机关的浓厚兴趣，在别墅里工作的人都知道。对威斯克来说不幸的是，之前没能对这幢别墅展开详细的调查，因为之前他一直以为这样的情报是没有必要的。虽然他还依稀记得几个变化丰富的机关，首先想起来的就是那头两只眼睛颜色不一样的老虎雕像，还有陈列着铠甲的那间能够喷出气体的房间，以及隐藏在图书馆里的那个房间等等…">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Wesker grinned suddenly and stood up, amazed that he hadn't thought of it already. Who said he had to be by himself? He'd ditched the S. T. A. R. S. to map out a new plan and search for the crests, but there was no reason that he had to do everything. Chris wasn't viable, he was too gung-ho, and Jill was still an unknown quantity… Barry, though… Barry Burton was a family man. And both Jill and Chris trusted him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="威斯克突然抿嘴一笑停下了脚步，为自己的这个想法感到有些吃惊。“谁说我是一个人？我又制定了一个新的计划，虽然为了寻找那些徽章而抛弃了S.T。A.R。S，但是这并不是必须一个人做所有事情的理由。”不能任用克里斯，因为他过于忠诚于职务；吉尔也不行，还没有看清她的真面目…但是，巴瑞嘛…巴瑞·波顿是一个家庭至上主义者。另外，克里斯与吉尔也都很信赖巴瑞。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Still grinning, Wesker walked to the door that led to the dining room balcony, surprised to find that he was looking forward to his little adventure. It was a chance to test his skills against the rest of the team and against the accidental test subjects that were surely still lurching around not to mention, of Spencer himself. And if he pulled it off, he was going to be a very rich man.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="威斯克一边朝着通往餐厅露台的门走去，一边对自己这种冒险的想法感到兴奋。这正是一个测试自己能力的机会，而测试的对象就是幸存下来的小队成员，同时也是对他们的一次挑战。如果这件事能够成功的话，自己一定能变富翁。">查看中文翻译</div>
