<div class="line_en">"Rubbish!" said Aunt Letty, and then, turning to the Witch, "Get out of my house this moment, you shameless hussy, or I'll send for the police." She thought the Witch must be someone out of a circus and she did not approve of bare arms.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“胡说！”蕾蒂姨妈转向女巫，“立即离开我的家，你这不知羞耻的荡妇，不然，我就叫警察。”她以为那女巫一定是从马戏团跑出来的，而且，她看不愤裸露的膀子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Now; slave, how long am I to wait for my chariot?" thundered the Witch. Uncle Andrew cowered away from her. Now that she was really present, all the silly thoughts he had had while looking at himself in the glass were oozing out of him. But Aunt Letty at once got up from her knees and came over to the centre of the room.</div>

<div class="line_en">Instantly, as it seemed to Uncle Andrew, the Queen towered up to an even greater height. Fire flashed from her eyes: she flung out her arm with the same gesture and the same horrible-sounding words that had lately turned the palacegates of Charn to dust. But nothing happened except that Aunt Letty, thinking that those horrible words were meant to be ordinary English, said:</div>

<div class="line_en">"Lead on, Slave," said the Witch to Uncle Andrew. He began muttering something about "regrettable violence must really protest", but at a single glance from Jadis he became speechless.

<div class="line_en">It must have been a terrible moment for the Witch when she suddenly realized that her power of turning people into dust, which had been quite real in her own world, was not going to work in ours. But she did not lose her nerve even for a second. Without wasting a thought on her disappointment, she lunged forward, caught Aunt Letty round the neck and the knees, raised her high above her head as if she had been no heavier than a doll, and threw her across the room. While Aunt Letty was still hurtling through the air, the housemaid (who was having a beautifully exciting morning) put her head in at the door and said, "If you please, sir, the 'ansom's come."</div>

<div class="line_en">"But the rings seem to work like magnets," thought Digory. "If I can only touch her and then slip on my yellow, we shall both go into the Wood between the Worlds. I wonder will she go all faint again there? Was that something the place does to her, or was it only the shock of being pulled out of her own world? But I suppose I'll have to risk that. And how am I to find the beast? I don't suppose Aunt Letty would let me go out, not unless I said where I was going. And I haven't got more than twopence. I'd need any amount of money for buses and trams if I went looking all over London. Anyway, I haven't the faintest idea where to look. I wonder if Uncle Andrew is still with her."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可是，那些戒指似乎很像磁铁，”迪格雷想，“只要我挨到她，再去摸我的黄戒指，她和我便都会回到各个世界之间的树林中去。不知她在那儿会不会又变得虚弱无力？是那地方对她不利呢，还是从她的世界里被拖出来时她受了惊吓？但我不得不去冒这个险。可我到哪儿去找这个畜生？我想，不管我说去哪儿，蕾蒂姨妈都不会让我去的；而我的口袋里只有两个便士。如果我在伦敦满城寻找，一定需要许许多多钱坐汽车和电车。再说，我压根儿就不知道上哪儿去找。不知道安德鲁舅舅是否还跟她在一起。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The problem was how to get the Witch back to her own world, or at any rate out of ours, as soon as possible. Whatever happened, she must not be allowed to go rampaging about the house. Mother must not see her.</div>

<div class="line_en">And, if possible, she must not be allowed to go rampaging about London either. Digory had not been in the drawingroom when she tried to "blast" Aunt Letty, but he had seen her "blast" the gates at Charn: so he knew her terrible powers and did not know that she had lost any of them by coming into our world. And he knew she meant to conquer our world. At the present moment, as far as he could see, she might be blasting Buckingham Palace or the Houses of Parliament: and it was almost certain that quite a number of policemen had by now been reduced to little heaps of dust. And there didn't seem to be anything he could do about that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果可能，不准她在伦教城里飞扬跋扈。她“毁灭”蕾蒂姨妈的时候，迪格雷不在客厅里，但他曾见过她捣毁恰恩的宫门，所以，他只知道她有骇人的魔力，并不知道自从到了我们的世界后，她的魔力有任何减弱。他还知道她想征服我们的世界。他能想像，目前她很可能正在捣毁白金汉宫或议会大厦；几乎可以肯定，为数不少的警察已经被化成一堆堆灰烬了。他不知道自己该怎样做。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He wondered about this a good deal as the first slow half-hour ticked on. But you need not wonder, for I am going to tell you. She had got home late for her dinner, with her shoes and stockings very wet. And when they asked her where she had been and what on earth she had been doing, she said she had been out with Digory Kirke. Under further questioning she said she had got her feet wet in a pool of water, and that the pool was in a wood. Asked where the wood was, she said she didn't know. Asked if it was in one of the parks, she said truthfully enough that she supposed it might be a sort of park. From all of this Polly's mother got the idea that Polly had gone off, without telling anyone, to some part of London she didn't know, and gone into a strange park and amused herself jumping into puddles. As a result she was told that she had been very naughty indeed and that she wouldn't be allowed to play with "that Kirke boy" any more if anything of the sort ever happened again. Then she was given dinner with all the nice parts left out and sent to bed for two solid hours. It was a thing that happened to one quite often in those days.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第一个半小时慢吞吞地过去了，他在这段时问里一直考虑着这个问题。但你不用着急，我来告诉你。波莉回家吃饭迟到了，鞋袜也是湿漉漉的。当被问到她去了哪里，干了些什么时．她说跟迪格雷·柯克出去了。再一追问，她说是在一个水潭里涅了脚的，那水潭在一片树林里。问及树林在哪儿，她说不知道。再问是否在一个公园里，她老老实实地说，她想也许是在一个公园里。波莉的妈妈由此得出结论：波莉未经允许，悄悄地跑到伦敦某个她不知道的地方，进了一个陌生的公园，跌进水坑里玩水。最后，波莉被告知，她实在太调皮了，以后如果再发生这样的事，便不准她和“那姓柯克的男孩”一起玩了。然后，她被允许吃了一些残羹剩饭，就被赶到床上，整整两小时后才能下床。这样的事情在那时候是常常发生的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It seemed in the end that the only thing he could do was to wait and hope that Uncle Andrew and the Witch would come back. If they did, he must rush out and get hold of the Witch and put on his yellow Ring before she had a chance to get into the house. This meant that he must watch the front door like a cat watching a mouse's hole; he dared not leave his post for a moment. So he went into the dining-room and "glued his face" as they say, to the window. It was a bow-window from which you could see the steps up to the front door and see up and down the street, so that no one could reach the front door without your knowing. "I wonder what Polly's doing?" thought Digory.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后，似乎他能做的惟一的事就是等候和盼望安德鲁舅舅和女巫回来。如果他们回来，他必须冲出去抓住女巫，趁她来不及踏进房子就截上黄戒指。这就意味着他必须像猫守着老鼠洞一样监视着前门，一步也不能离开岗位。所以，他进了餐室，像人们常说的那样，把脸“贴”在窗户上：那是一扇凸肚窗，可以从里面看见通向前门的台阶，而且能看清整条街道，任何人走到前门都逃不出你的视线。”波莉在干什么呢？”迪格雷想。+">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">During his long watching and waiting one small thing happened which I shall have to mention because something important came of it later on. A lady called with some grapes for Digory's Mother; and as the dining-room door was open, Digory couldn't help overhearing Aunt Letty and the lady as they talked in the hall.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在漫长的等待和监视中，发生了一桩小事。我之所以要提它是因为以后有件，要的事情与之相关。一位女士带着葡萄酒来看迪格雷的妈妈。由于餐室的门开着，迪格雷很自然地听到了蕾蒂姨妈和那位女士在大厅里的谈话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What lovely grapes!" came Aunt Letty's voice. "I'm sure if anything could do her good these would. But poor, dear little Mabel! I'm afraid it would need fruit from the land of youth to help her now. Nothing in this world will do much." Then they both lowered their voices and said a lot more that he could not hear.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“多可爱的葡萄！”蕾蒂姨妈的声音，“我想这些葡萄一定会对她有好处的。唉，可怜的亲爱的小玛贝尔！恐怕现在她需要年轻的土地上长出的果子来治病。这个世界里任何东西都没有多大的效果。”后来，她们两人都压低了声音，说了许多迪格雷听不见的话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So while Digory was staring out of the dining-room window, Polly was lying in bed, and both were thinking how terribly slowly the time could go. I think, myself, I would rather have been in Polly's position. She had only to wait for the end of her two hours: but every few minutes Digory would hear a cab or a baker's van or a butcher's boy coming round the corner and think "Here she comes", and then find it wasn't. And in between these false alarms, for what seemed hours and hours, the clock ticked on and one big fly -- high up and far out of reach buzzed against the window. It was one of those houses that get very quiet and dull in the afternoon and always seem to smell of mutton.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所以，当迪格雷从餐室的窗户向外看时，波莉不躺在床上。两人都在想，时间过得多么慢啊，我个人认为，我宁肯处在波莉的位置上。她只是等候那两小时的结束，而迪格雷呢，每隔几分钟，只要听到马车声、面包匠送货车的声音或肉铺小伙计转过街角的声音，就以为”她来了”，然后却是一场空。除了这此令人惊悸的谬误外，其余时间里，只听见嘀嘀嗒嗒的钟声，像过了无数个小时一样漫长难熬。在头上高不可及的地方，一只大苍蝇嗡嗡地碰撞老窗玻璃。这幢住宅在下午往往显得非常安静和枯燥，而且，总有一股淡淡的羊肉味。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">If he had heard that bit about the land of youth a few days ago he would have thought Aunt Letty was just talking without meaning anything in particular, the way grown-ups do, and it wouldn't have interested him. He almost thought so now. But suddenly it flashed upon his mind that he now knew (even if Aunt Letty didn't) that there really were other worlds and that he himself had been in one of them. At that rate there might be a real Land of Youth somewhere. There might be almost anything. There might be fruit in some other world that would really cure his mother! And oh, oh -- Well, you know how it feels if you begin hoping for something that you want desperately badly; you almost fight against the hope because it is too good to be true; you've been disappointed so often before. That was how Digory felt. But it was no good trying to throttle this hope. It might really, really, it just might be true. So many odd things had happened already. And he had the magic rings. There must be worlds you could get to through every pool in the wood. He could hunt through them all. And then Mother well again. Everything right again. He forgot all about watching for the Witch. His hand was already going into the pocket where he kept the yellow ring, when all at once he herd a sound of galloping.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果他前几天听到“年轻的土地”这个说法，他可能会以为蕾蒂姨妈只是随便说说而已，没有什么特别的意义。大人们说话往往这样，这不会引起他的兴趣。现在，他差不多也这样想。然而，他一下子想起来，的确存在着别的世界（蕾蒂姨妈并不知道），他自己就去过其中之一。那么，也许真有一片“年轻的土地”，任何事情都可能存在。在别的世界里，也许有某种果子真的能治好妈妈的病！噢——你知道，盼望得到梦寐以求的东西时是什么滋味吗？因为你过去失望太多，也因为那种希望美好得不真实，你几乎要和希望作对了。这就是迪格雷当时的感觉。但是想扼杀这种希望是无用的。可能一——真的，真的，有那种可能性。那么多稀奇古怪的事已经发生了，而且他有魔法戒指。每个水潭底下都有一个世界。他可以寻遍所有的世界。然后一——妈妈的病就好了。一切都好了。他把留神着等候女巫的事全忘了。他已经在向放黄戒指的口袋伸手了，恰在此时，他突然听到一阵急驰而来的马蹄声。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">First came the hansom. There was no one in the driver's seat. On the roof -- not sitting, but standing on the roof swaying with superb balance as it came at full speed round the corner with one wheel in the air -- was Jadis the Queen of Queens and the Terror of Charn. Her teeth were bared, her eyes shone like fire, and her long hair streamed out behind her like a comet's tail. She was flogging the horse without mercy. Its nostrils were wide and red and its sides were spotted with foam. It galloped madly up to the front door, missing the lamp-post by an inch, and then reared up on its hind legs. The hansom crashed into the lamp-post and shattered into several pieces. The Witch, with a magnificent jump, had sprung clear just in time and landed on the horse's back. She settled herself astride and leaned forward, whispering things in its ear. They must have been things meant not to quiet it but to madden it. It was on its hind legs again in a moment, and its neigh was like a scream; it was all hoofs and teeth and eyes and tossing mane. Only a splendid rider could have stayed on its back.</div>

<div class="line_en">Before Digory had recovered his breath a good many other things began to happen. A second hansom dashed up close behind the first: out of it there jumped a fat man in a frock-coat and a policeman. Then came a third hansom with two more policemen in it. After it, came about twenty people (mostly errand boys) on bicycles, all ringing their bells and letting out cheers and cat-calls. Last of all came a crowd of people on foot: all very hot with running, but obviously enjoying themselves. Windows shot up in all the houses of that street and a housemaid or a butler appeared at every front door. They wanted to see the fun.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪格雷还来不及松口气，就又开始发生很多事情了。第二辆马车紧接着第一辆飞驰而来，车上跳下一个穿礼服的胖子和一名警察。然后，第三辆马车载着两名警察也快速过来。随着一阵嘘声、喝彩声，大约二十个人（大多数是童仆）骑着自行车，一路响着铃跟了上来。最后是一群步行者，虽然一个个跑得很热，但显然十分开心。所有临街的窗户都迅速地打开了。每一幢房子的前门都有一个看热闹的女佣或男仆。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Meanwhile an old gentleman had begun to struggle shakily out of the ruins of the first hansom. Several people rushed forward to help him; but as one pulled him one way and another another, perhaps he would have got out quite as quickly on his own.

<div class="line_en">"Look out!" called several voices, and the policeman jumped a step backwards just in time. The horse had aimed a kick at him which would probably have killed him. Then the Witch wheeled the horse round so that she faced the crowd and its hind-legs were on the footpath. She had a long, bright knife in her hand and had been busily cutting the horse free from the wreck of the hansom.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“小心，”几个人同时喊道，警察及时朝后跳了一步。那匹马差点儿一脚将他踢死。接着女巫掉转马头，对着人群，马的后腿已经踏上了人行道。她手里挥舞着一把明晃晃的长刀，正使劲地砍着套索，要把马和马车的残骸分开。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">All this time Digory had been trying to get into a position from which he could touch the Witch. This wasn't at all easy because, on the side nearest to him, there were too many people. And in order to get round to the other side he had to pass between the horse's hoofs and the railings of the "area" that surrounded the house; for the Ketterleys' house had a basement. If you know anything about horses, and especially if you had seen what a state that horse was in at the moment, you will realize that this was a ticklish thing to do. Digory knew lots about horses, but he set his teeth and got ready to make a dash for it as soon as he saw a favourable moment.</div>
