<div class="line_en">In that same juncture of time when the Fifty-Two awaited their fate Madame Defarge held darkly ominous council with The Vengeance and Jacques Three of the Revolutionary Jury. Not in the wine-shop did Madame Defarge confer with these ministers, but in the shed of the wood-sawyer, erst a mender of roads. The sawyer himself did not participate in the conference, but abided at a little distance, like an outer satellite who was not to speak until required, or to offer an opinion until invited.</div>

<div class="line_en">The question was addressed to the wood-sawyer, who hurriedly replied in the affirmative: seizing the occasion to add that he was the most ardent of Republicans, and that he would be in effect the most desolate of Republicans, if anything prevented him from enjoying the pleasure of smoking his afternoon pipe in the contemplation of the droll national barber. He was so very demonstrative herein, that he might have been suspected (perhaps was, by the dark eyes that looked contemptuously at him out of Madame Defarge's head) of having his small individual fears for his own personal safety, every hour in the day.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这话问的是锯木工。锯木工赶快说他也要去，而且抓紧机会补充说，他是最积极的共和分子。实际上若是有什么东西使他失去了享受一边抽午后烟、一边欣赏国家级剃头师傅精采表演的机会，他就会成为最孤独的共和分子了。他的表白有点过分，甚至叫人怀疑他每时每刻都在为自己那渺小的安全担心。而他也许确实在受着怀疑，因为德伐日太太一双黑眼睛正轻蔑地望着他。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There were many women at that time, upon whom the time laid a dreadfully disfiguring hand; but, there was not one among them more to be dreaded than this ruthless woman, now taking her way along the streets. Of a strong and fearless character, of shrewd sense and readiness, of great determination, of that kind of beauty which not only seems to impart to its possessor firmness and animosity, but to strike into others an instinctive recognition of those qualities; the troubled time would have heaved her up, under any circumstances. But, imbued from her childhood with a brooding sense of wrong, and an inveterate hatred of a class, opportunity had developed her into a tigress. She was absolutely without pity. If she had ever had the virtue in her, it had quite gone out of her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那时的许多妇女都被时代之手捏弄得可怕地变了形，却没有一个妇女能比现在走在大街上的这个无情的女人更可怕的了。她有坚强勇敢的性格，精明敏捷的头脑，还有巨大的决心。她具有一种美，那美不但赋予了她稳定坚实、苦大仇深的特色，而且使人不由得由衷地赞美这一特色。无论情况如何，那“混乱的时代”是必然会使她出人头地的。但是由于她从儿童时代起就深感含冤受屈，养成了根深蒂固的阶级仇恨，机会便把她发展成了一只母老虎。她是绝对没有怜惜之情的。即使曾有过也早已泯灭了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Such a heart Madame Defarge carried under her rough robe. Carelessly worn, it was a becoming robe enough, in a certain weird way, and her dark hair looked rich under her coarse red cap. Lying hidden in her bosom, was a loaded pistol. Lying hidden at her waist, was a sharpened dagger. Thus accoutred, and walking with the confident tread of such a character, and with the supple freedom of a woman who had habitually walked in her girlhood, bare-foot and bare-legged, on the brown sea-sand, Madame Defarge took her way along the streets.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在德伐日太太那粗布袍子下而的就是这样一颗心。那布袍她随意穿着，却很合身，但带几分怪诞。那一头黑发在粗糙的红便帽之下显得尤其丰密。她胸前掖了一把子弹上膛的手枪。腰间别了一把磨得飞快的匕首。她便以这样一身装束、这样一个角色的自信步伐在大街上走着：表现了习惯于光着腿赤着脚在褐色的沙滩上行走的妇女的矫健和轻松。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was nothing to her, that an innocent man was to die for the sins of his forefathers; she saw, not him, but them. It was nothing to her, that his wife was to be made a widow and his daughter an orphan; that was insufficient punishment, because they were her natural enemies and her prey, and as such had no right to live. To appeal to her, was made hopeless by her having no sense of pity, even for herself. If she had been laid low in the streets, in any of the many encounters in which she had been engaged, she would not have pitied herself; nor, if she had been ordered to the axe to-morrow, would she have gone to it with any softer feeling than a fierce desire to change places with the man who sent her there.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一个清白无辜的男人要为父辈的罪行而死亡，这在她完全不算一回事。她看见的不是他，而是他的父辈。那个男人的妻子要变成寡妇，女儿要变成孤儿，这在她也不算一回事。那种惩罚还不够，因为她们都是她天生的敌人，是她的战利品，本没有活下去的权利。要使她谅解是办不到的，她没有怜惜之心，甚至对自己也如此。若是她在自己参加过的战斗中倒下了，她也不会怜惜自己；若是她被送上断头台，她也只会咬牙切齿恨不得让送她上断头台的人跟她易地而处，却没有丝毫怨艾伤感的柔情。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Seeing in this arrangement the hope of rendering real service in that pressing emergency, Miss Pross hailed it with joy. She and Jerry had beheld the coach start, had known who it was that Solomon brought, had passed some ten minutes in tortures of suspense, and were now concluding their arrangements to follow the coach, even as Madame Defarge, taking her way through the streets, now drew nearer and nearer to the else-deserted lodging in which they held their consultation.</div>

<div class="line_en">Now, when the journey of the travelling coach, at that very moment waiting for the completion of its load, had been planned out last night, the difficulty of taking Miss Pross in it had much engaged Mr. Lorry's attention. It was not merely desirable to avoid overloading the coach, but it was of the highest importance that the time occupied in examining it and its passengers, should be reduced to the utmost; since their escape might depend on the saving of only a few seconds here and there. Finally, he had proposed, after anxious consideration, that Miss Pross and Jerry, who were at liberty to leave the city, should leave it at three o'clock in the lightest-wheeled conveyance known to that period. Unencumbered with luggage, they would soon overtake the coach, and, passing it and preceding it on the road, would order its horses in advance, and greatly facilitate its progress during the precious hours of the night, when delay was the most to be dreaded.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Is there any noise in the streets?" she asked him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“街上有闹声没有？”她问他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">By good fortune she had a veil on her bonnet, or she could hardly have gone along the streets without being stopped. By good fortune, too, she was naturally so peculiar in appearance as not to show disfigurement like any other woman. She needed both advantages, for the marks of gripping fingers were deep in her face, and her hair was torn, and her dress (hastily composed with unsteady hands) was clutched and dragged a hundred ways.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="幸好她的帽子上垂着面纱，否则她在路上怕是难免受人盘问的。也幸好她天生长相奇特，因此不至于像别的妇女给人衣冠不整的印象。她需要这两个有利条件，因为她头发散乱，脸上留下深深的指甲印，衣服也给东拉西扯弄了个乱七八糟，只用颤抖的手匆忙整理过一下。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The usual noises," Mr. Cruncher replied; and looked surprised by the question and by her aspect.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“有日常的闹声，”克朗彻先生回答，他因为这个问题和她那副怪像露出一脸惊讶。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In crossing the bridge, she dropped the door key in the river. Arriving at the cathedral some few minutes before her escort, and waiting there, she thought, what if the key were already taken in a net, what if it were identified, what if the door were opened and the remains discovered, what if she were stopped at the gate, sent to prison, and charged with murder! In the midst of these fluttering thoughts, the escort appeared, took her in, and took her away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="过桥时她把钥匙扔进了河里。她比她的保镖早几分钟到达大教堂，在等他时她想了许多。若是那钥匙叫渔网网住了会怎么样？若是鉴定出是哪家的钥匙会怎么样？若是门打开，发现了尸体会怎么样？若是在城门自把她扣留下来，送进监狱，判她杀人罪又会怎么样？她正在满脑子胡思乱想，她的保镖来了，让她上了车，把她带走了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Is there any noise in the streets now?" asked Miss Pross again, presently.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“街上现在有闹声没有？”普洛丝小姐不久又问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I can hear," said Miss Pross, seeing that he spoke to her, "nothing. O, my good man, there was first a great crash, and then a great stillness, and that stillness seems to be fixed and unchangeable, never to be broken any more as long as my life lasts."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“一点儿也没听见，”普洛丝小姐见他说话便回答。“啊，我的好人，先是一声砰，声音大极了，然后就没有声音了，再也没有声音了，永远没有了，我这一辈子怕是再也听不见声音了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I don't hear you," said Miss Pross. "What do you say?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你的话我没听见，”普洛丝小姐说，“你说的是什么？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"If she don't hear the roll of those dreadful carts, now very nigh their journey's end," said Mr. Cruncher, glancing over his shoulder, "it's my opinion that indeed she never will hear anything else in this world."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="既然她连那些可怕的四车的轰隆声都听不见，——囚车，快到目的地了，“克朗彻先生掉过头看了一眼说，”我看她确实是再也听不见这世界上的声音了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was in vain for Mr. Cruncher to repeat what he said; Miss Pross could not hear him. "So I'll nod my head," thought Mr. Cruncher, amazed, "at all events she'll see that." And she did.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克朗彻先生重复了他的回答，可那也没有用，普洛丝小姐仍然听不见。“那我就点头吧，”克朗彻先生大吃一惊，想道。“这她无论如何是懂得的。”她倒是懂的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Blest if she ain't in a queer condition!" said Mr. Cruncher, more and more disturbed. "Wot can she have been a takin', to keep her courage up? Hark! There's the roll of them dreadful carts! You can hear that, miss?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“她这个样子可真奇怪！”克朗彻先生越来越紧张，“她喝了什么玩艺儿给自己壮胆了么？听！那吓人的囚车在隆隆地响！你听见车声了没有，小姐？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Gone deaf in an hour?" said Mr. Cruncher, ruminating, with his mind much disturbed; "wot's come to her?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“才一个小时耳朵怎么就聋了？”克朗彻先生寻思，心里很着急。“她出了什么事了？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Again Mr. Cruncher nodded his head.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I feel," said Miss Pross, "as if there had been a flash and a crash, and that crash was the last thing I should ever hear in this life."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我觉得，”普洛丝小姐说，“好像火光一闪，又砰的一声，那一声就成了我这一辈子听见的最后一声了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
