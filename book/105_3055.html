<div class="line_en">That night Dylan slept little, but lay awake thinking about souls, about Tristan and all the other ferrymen that must exist, about where she was going. She supposed her body was getting accustomed to not needing to sleep, but in truth there were so many thoughts running wild in her head that sleep would have evaded her anyway.</div>

<div class="line_en">"You're awake." Tristan's voice was low in the semi-dark, coming just from her left.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你醒了。”在半明半暗之间，从左侧传来崔斯坦低沉的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dylan swivelled round so that she could look at Tristan. He was sitting in a chair, staring out into the night, but when he felt her eyes on him he twisted round to face her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦把脸转过来，这样可以看到崔斯坦。他坐在椅子上，望着外面的夜空。但当他感觉她的眼睛在注视自己时，也把身子扭了过来面对着她。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你想和我谈谈吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dylan bit her lip, considering. She didn't want to lament her bad luck, not when he had it so much worse. But there were a million uncertainties buzzing round her head, and Tristan might be able to answer at least some of them. He smiled at her encouragingly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦咬着嘴唇，思考着。她不想哀叹自己命途多舛，他的坏运气更甚于自己。但是她头脑中有无数的疑问，乱糟糟，闹哄哄。至少崔斯坦能够解答其中一部分吧。崔斯坦对着她微笑，让她又鼓起了勇气。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Ah." Understanding broke across Tristan's face. He grimaced at her. "I can't really help you with that."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“啊！”崔斯坦脸上满是理解的表情。他愁眉不展地看着迪伦，“这个问题我真的帮不了你。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I was thinking about what's beyond the wasteland," she began.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我在想过了荒原又是什么？”她开了口。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I know," she said softly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我懂。”迪伦轻声说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She tried not to show her frustration, but it was something she was getting increasingly anxious about. Where was she going? Having seen the demons that loitered in the darkness ready to pull her under, she doubted it was anywhere bad. It must be a good place; why else would they try to stop her getting there? And it must be somewhere too. If oblivion lingered at her destination, what would be the point of crossing the wasteland?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她尽量不露出沮丧的表情，但这个问题让她越来越困扰。她要去向何方呢？之前她已经见识了在黑暗中徘徊的恶魔随时想把她拖下去，她认为自己要去的不是个很糟糕的地方，肯定是个好地方。否则它们为什么要阻止她去那儿呢？而且那一定是某个地方。如果最终的结局就是陷入无知无觉的昏迷状态，那穿越荒原又有何意义呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Hardly. Dylan huffed a breathy laugh. It didn't last long, though. She looked down at where shadows from the fire were playing across the old, cracked stone floor. They flickered and danced in a way that was eerily familiar.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不。迪伦笑了，笑里带着喘息声，旋即笑声又止住了。她低头看着满是裂缝的石板地，炉火的影子在上面摇曳。它们跳跃舞蹈的方式既诡异又熟悉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Is that all that's worrying you?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“困扰你的就是这些吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Those demons," she began.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那些恶魔。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He sounded completely confident and when Dylan looked up she saw that his eyes were wide and glowering, his jaw clenched. She believed him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的声音听起来非常自信。迪伦抬眼看到他二目圆睁，眼中带着怒火，牙关紧咬的样子，觉得应该相信他说的话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You don't have to worry about them," Tristan told her firmly. "I won't let them hurt you."</div>

<div class="line_en">The silence stretched between them again but now, having broken it, Dylan found the quiet uncomfortable. Besides, more thoughts were bubbling in her head.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两人之间又无语了。但刚刚打破沉默的迪伦对这宁静感到极不自在，而且，她脑中还不断有想法冒出来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Okay," she said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好吧。”她说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm sorry." It was impossible to miss the wistfulness in Tristan's voice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我很抱歉。”迪伦听出了崔斯坦声音里的惆怅。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You know what I can't get my head around?" she asked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你知道我最想不通的是什么吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是什么？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That you don't actually look like you. I mean," she went on, realising that didn't make any sense, "I can see you. I can touch you." She held up a hand, fingers searching in his direction, but didn't have the courage to reach out and make contact. "But what I see, what I feel, it's not really you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“就是你看起来不是真实的自己。”意识到自己有点词不达意，她又接着说，“我是说，我能看见你，我能摸到你。”她伸出手，手指朝黑暗中他的方向摸索，但没有勇气去抚摸他，“但是我所看到的，我所感觉到的，并不是真正的你。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tristan stared at her, his expression fathomless. "Do you think I have a soul?" he asked quietly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="崔斯坦看着她，脸上的表情难以捉摸，“你认为我有灵魂吗？”他沉静地问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dylan chewed on her tongue, realising she'd been thoughtless. "It's strange," she mumbled. Then, wanting to make up for her tactlessness she added, "But what you look like doesn't matter. Not really. Who you are, it's in your head and your heart, you know? Your soul."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦咬着舌头，意识到自己刚才的话太欠考虑了，“很奇怪。”她喃喃自语道。接着，她想弥补自己刚才这句话的冒失，“不过你看起来什么样子并没有什么关系，真的没关系。你脑中和心里的那个才是真的你，知道吗？就是你的灵魂。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Of course you do." Dylan answered quickly, but honestly. Tristan saw that in her face and smiled. She smiled back, but it turned into an ear-splitting yawn. She threw her hand over her mouth, embarrassed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“当然有啊。”迪伦马上实心实意地回答。崔斯坦看出了她的真诚，笑了。她也对着他笑，但笑容最后变成了一个大哈欠。她尴尬地用手捂住了嘴。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dylan hugged her knees, curled up in the armchair, and stared beyond Tristan towards the fire. She wondered whether she ought to say something, but she couldn't think of anything that wouldn't sound stupid. Besides, she thought to herself, he might want to think. This might be as close to being alone as he ever gets.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦抱着膝盖，蜷缩在扶手椅上，目光越过崔斯坦盯着炉火。她不知道自己该不该说些什么，但又想不出什么听起来不傻的话。而且，她心想，崔斯坦可能想要思考事情。不妨让他像以前那样一个人待一会儿。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She didn't meet his gaze, but kept her eyes fixed on the fire, letting it lull her into a semi-trance. "At the beginning," she said, "when the souls sleep. I bet it's nice to get a bit of peace and quiet. You must get tired of always having to talk to them."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她没有与他的目光对视，依然盯着炉火，火光让她平静下来，似乎进入了半梦半醒的状态，“一开始，”她说，“当灵魂休眠的时候，我敢肯定它们得到了片刻的平静和安宁。老是要和它们讲话，你一定累极了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I guess it's easier at the start," she mused.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我猜开始会容易些。”她默默地想。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What do you mean?" Tristan asked, turning back to look at her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你这是什么意思？”崔斯坦转过身，看着她问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I guess my body still thinks it needs sleep," she said sheepishly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我觉得我的身体仍然觉得它需要睡觉。”她睡意蒙眬地说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She faltered right at the very end, because it occurred to her suddenly that that's what she was: one of them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="说到最后一句，她的声音颤抖起来，因为她突然想到自己也是“它们”中的一员。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tristan nodded. "It's a bit disconcerting at first. You'll probably feel horrible tomorrow, really exhausted. It's all psychological, though…" He tailed off. The silence deepened and felt almost tangible.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="崔斯坦点点头，“开始会有些不适。明天你可能会感觉很不舒服，非常疲惫。这都是心理作用，虽然……”他的声音越来越小，最后消失了。沉默的气氛更浓，简直触手可及。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She was right, though. He did prefer the start of the journey when the souls drifted out of consciousness and he could be almost alone. Sleep was like a curtain, shielding him, even if only for a few hours, from their selfishness, their ignorance. He was staggered that this… this girl would have the compassion, the selflessness to think about his feelings, his needs. He glanced over at her, huddled in the chair, looking for all the world like she wanted to disappear into the ancient cushions. He felt moved to do something to take the awkward blush from her cheeks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，她刚才说的倒是实情。他真的更喜欢旅途的前半截，那时候，灵魂们只是在昏昏沉沉地跟着走，他几乎跟独处差不多。睡眠像一道幕布一样，遮蔽了他们的自私与无知，他也乐得眼不见心不烦（哪怕只有几个小时的时间）。可这个……这个女孩竟然会有同情心，竟然无私地考虑他的感受、他的需要，这让他暗自吃惊。他看着蜷缩在椅子上的迪伦，她看起来简直像是要在那个古老的垫子上找个缝钻下去。他心里有些感动，想做些什么好让她脸上尴尬的红晕消散。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'll stop talking," she promised.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我一定要闭嘴了。”她暗自发誓。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tristan didn't respond for a moment and she cringed, reading the worst possible meaning into his silence. Of course she was just another soul to him. Chagrin washed through her and she squirmed in the chair.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="崔斯坦一时无语。迪伦变得畏畏缩缩，心里解读着这沉默可能包含的最坏含义。当然了，对他来说，她也不过是又一个灵魂而已。迪伦感到无比懊恼，坐在椅子上变得局促不安起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You asked me before who was the worst soul I've ever ferried across," he began, "but I lied. It wasn't you." He paused for just long enough to shoot her a quick look.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“之前你问，我摆渡过的最糟糕的灵魂是谁，”他开始讲，“但是我撒了谎。那不是你。”他顿了一下，目光飞快地扫了迪伦一下。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你想再听一个故事吗？”他问。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“不是我吗？”迪伦的头靠在膝盖上，顽皮地看着崔斯坦。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No," he promised. Then the jokiness dropped out of his tone. "It was a little boy."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不是。”他发誓一般地说。接下来他的声音里没有了那股子滑稽腔调，“那是一个小男孩。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Cancer," Tristan murmured, unwilling to recount the tale any louder than a whisper. "You should have seen him, lying there. It was heartbreaking. He was tiny and frail, white-faced with a bald head from chemotherapy."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“癌症。”崔斯坦喃喃地说，他只愿意用耳语般的声音讲这个故事，“你真应该见见他。他躺在那里，那场面让人心碎。他又瘦小又孱弱，脸色煞白，由于做了化疗，头上已经没有头发了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"A boy?" Dylan asked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“一个男孩？”迪伦问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tristan hated guiding children. Although they came the most willingly and were the most trusting, they were also the hardest. They did not complain, though he felt that they deserved to the most. What an injustice, to die before you had had the chance to grow, to live, to experience.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="崔斯坦打心底里不愿意引导孩子。尽管他们是最乐意跟着他走的，也是最信任他的，但他们也是最难带的。他们不抱怨，尽管他觉得他们最应该抱怨。在你还没有机会长大成人、体验人生之前就死去，多么的不公平啊！">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"A doctor. I told him…" Tristan choked off, not sure whether he dared to admit to this. "I told him I could make the pain go away, that I could make him feel good again. His little face just lit up, like I was offering him a Christmas present. He leaped out of the bed and told me that he felt better already."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“一个医生，我告诉他……”崔斯坦顿了一下，不敢确定自己是不是有勇气承认，“我告诉他我能让他的病痛消失，我可以让他重新感觉好起来。他的小脸一下子焕发出光彩，就像从我这得到了一件圣诞礼物一样。他跳下床，告诉我他现在已经感觉好多了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But he did want to. He didn't know why; it wasn't a pleasant tale, and there was no happy ending. He wanted to share something of himself with her, though. Something meaningful.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是他想要讲这个故事，连他自己也不知道为什么。这个故事一点也不愉快，故事结局也并不圆满。但他就是想把自己的一些事讲给她听，那是些有意义的事。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"The first day was fine; we made the safe house easily and I kept him amused him by showing him magic tricks, conjuring a fire from nowhere, making things move without touching them. Anything to capture his attention. The next day he was tired. His mind still felt like it was ill, but he had wanted to walk. He hadn't been allowed to walk for months because he'd been so sick. I couldn't refuse him. I should have."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“第一天过得很愉快。我们轻而易举就到了避难所，我给他表演魔术，凭空变出一堆火，还隔空搬东西，把他逗得很开心。我使出了浑身解数吸引他的注意力。第二天他很疲惫，仍然觉得自己在生病，但是他愿意走路。因为得了重病，他已经好几个月都不能走路了。我没有拒绝他，我原本应该拒绝的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">His voice died but the silence was still punctuated by his ragged breathing, hitching and breaking as if he was crying, though his cheeks were dry. Dylan gazed at him, her expression anguished. Of its own accord, her hand reached out and wrapped itself around his. The room was warm but his skin was cold to the touch. Dylan trailed her fingertips across the back of his hand. He looked at her for a heartbeat, his expression sombre, then he flipped his hand over and wound his fingers around hers. He held her there, one thumb tracing slow circles around the heart of her palm. It tickled, but Dylan would have rather lost her hand than pull away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的声音停了下来，但起伏的呼吸声仍在沉默中响起。那声音时断时续，如同他在抽噎一般，尽管他的脸颊上并没有泪水。迪伦望着他，表情痛苦，她不由自主地攥住了他的手。屋子里很暖和，但一触之下他的皮肤却是冰冷的。迪伦的指尖在他的手背轻轻滑过，他表情忧郁地看着她，一瞬间过后，他的手翻过来，手指和她的手指缠绕在了一起。他就这样抓着她的手，一根拇指在她的掌心慢慢地画着圆圈。迪伦感觉痒痒的，但她宁愿失去那只手，也不想放开他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dylan was almost afraid to ask. But she couldn't leave the story here like this. "What happened?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"I tripped," Tristan croaked, eyes glistening in the muted light from the flames. "I tripped and I dropped him. I let him go to break my fall. Just for a second. A split second. But it was enough. They got him and they dragged him under."</div>

<div class="line_en">Tristan saw straight through her denial. He got up from the chair and crouched in front of her, still gripping her hand. He looked her straight in the eye as he spoke. Dylan was desperate to look away, but she was hypnotised.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="崔斯坦看出了她在佯装镇定。他从椅子上起身，蹲在迪伦面前，依然紧紧抓着她的手。他说话时眼睛直视迪伦，迪伦很想把目光移到别处，但却像是已经被他的眼神催眠了一般，一动不动。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Don't be frightened," he added, feeling the change in atmosphere. His fingers squeezed her hand with gentle pressure and Dylan flushed.</div>

<div class="line_en">Dylan stuffed her hand between her jean-clad knees, trying not to show that her heart was pounding, the skin on her palm tingling. She tried to quieten her breathing as she watched Tristan approach one of the windows, and stare off into the night. She wanted to call to him, to pull him away from the glass and the demons that lurked just beyond, but he knew much more about them than she did. He must know he was safe. Still, nothing could draw her that close to those things. She hunched a little deeper in the chair, shuddering slightly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦把手夹在穿着牛仔裤的膝盖之间，她的心在狂跳不止，手掌上的皮肤一阵发麻，她尽量把这一切都隐藏起来。她看着崔斯坦朝一扇窗子走去，看着窗外的夜空。迪伦努力让自己的呼吸变得平缓，心里呼唤着他，想把他从窗子那里拉回来，远离那些潜伏在外面的魔鬼。但他比自己更了解这些家伙，他一定清楚现在他很安全，但她怎样也不会靠近那些东西的。她又在椅子上蜷了一下身子，微微打了个冷战。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He considered her for a short moment. "The wraiths, they'll take any soul, and gladly. But pure souls are like a feast to them."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他看着她思索了片刻，“这些恶鬼是无论什么灵魂都来者不拒，照单全收的。但纯洁的灵魂对他们来说就如同一顿大餐。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Virgins," he repeated. Dylan struggled not to roll her eyes to cover her embarrassment. She really hadn't needed him to repeat that word. "Any time a soul comes into the wasteland that is still untainted, in that way at least, the wraiths are more aggressive, more dangerous." He looked at her, making sure he had her full attention. "They want you -- you specifically. To them, your soul would be a feast. More desirable, more delectable, than the bitter taste of a soul who lived too long."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“处女……”他又重复了一遍。迪伦拼命保持眼珠不动，好掩饰自己的尴尬。她却觉得那重复实在是多余。“任何时候，只要一个进入荒原的灵魂仍是无瑕之躯，魔鬼们就会变得更加咄咄逼人，更加凶险。”他看着她，确信她的注意力全在自己这里，“它们想要你，特别想要你。对它们来说，你的灵魂就是一顿大餐。那些活了太久的灵魂味道是苦的，跟他们比起来，你更加诱人，更加可口。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I don't mean that you are perfect," Tristan interrupted. "A pure soul… it's an innocent." Dylan shook her head, ready to deny his words again. But then he said it, that word that made the room totally erupt into flames. "A virgin."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我并不是说你完美无缺，”崔斯坦打断了她，“一个纯洁的灵魂……是天真无邪的……”迪伦摇着头，随时准备再次否认。但是他接下来说出口的这个词让整个屋子一下子充满了火药味，“处女……”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="她的嘴张开又合上，合上又张开，来来回回了几次，就是发不出一点声音。崔斯坦仔细观察着她，她似乎控制不了脸上的肌肉和血液，血一下子涌到脸颊，顿时满面通红。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mortified, she writhed in the chair, but that wasn't enough. She was still trapped under his gaze like an ant under a magnifying glass. She exploded out of her seat and her momentum carried her forward a few steps until she was facing the window Tristan had been looking through just a few moments before. She approached it, purposely avoiding catching his reflection, and pressed her forehead to the frigid glass, trying to cool the red-hot embarrassment that had painted her cheeks red.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她感觉自己蒙受了极大的羞辱，在椅子上坐立不安，但这还不够。她仍然陷在他的注视下难以自拔，就像一只放大镜下的蚂蚁。她从椅子上一跃而起，身上冒出一股子劲，带着她往前走了几步，一直走到窗前。崔斯坦在这之前一直在看着她。她走近的时候，有意不去看他。她满心的难堪滚烫滚烫的，把自己的脸颊都染得绯红。迪伦把额头贴在冰冷的玻璃上，尽力让它们冷却下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dylan just gaped at him. The words he was speaking didn't make it past the haze in her brain. She was stuck on that one word. Virgin. How the hell did he know that about her? Was it written across her forehead? But then she remembered, how he'd told her he knew each soul. Inside and out. She cringed. How humiliating! And the way his lips kept twitching as he watched her squirm; he was laughing at her. Had that been what he was thinking, when he was hanging onto her hand: that she was pure and innocent? A virgin?!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦瞠目结舌地看着他，他的话还是让她一头雾水。她只是一门心思想着那个词—处女。他到底是怎么知道这些的？难道这个词就写在她的额头上？不过，紧接着她就想起来了，他曾经跟她说过，他了解每一个灵魂，里里外外一清二楚。她感觉难堪极了，多丢脸啊！还有，他看着她局促不安时嘴唇一个劲地抽动，他是在笑话自己。他紧紧抓着自己手的时候，脑子里就在想这些事吗？她又纯洁又单纯？是个处女？！">查看中文翻译</div>
