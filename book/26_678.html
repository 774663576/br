<div class="line_cn" title="“我们有其他人——我们确实还有其他人。”我表示赞同。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yet even though we have them," he returned, still with his hands in his pockets and planted there in front of me, "they don't much count, do they?"</div>

<div class="line_en">On this, however, he faced to the window again and presently reached it with his vague, restless, cogitating step. He remained there awhile, with his forehead against the glass, in contemplation of the stupid shrubs I knew and the dull things of November. I had always my hypocrisy of "work!" behind which, now, I gained the sofa. Steadying myself with it there as I had repeatedly done at those moments of torment that I have described as the moments of my knowing the children to be given to something from which I was barred, I sufficiently obeyed my habit of being prepared for the worst.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="说着他又面向窗户，满怀心事地走到窗前。他在那里站了一会儿，额头抵着玻璃，注视着那片我熟悉的、乏味的灌木丛和十一月份的萧条景色。我总是以“工作”作为掩饰，在它的掩饰下，现在，我占据了沙发。我靠在沙发上平静下来，在我所描述过的痛苦时分，我曾屡次这样做。当我得知孩子们瞒着不让我知道的事情时，我就感到很痛苦，我完全遵从我的习惯，做好了最坏的准备。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This inference grew in a few minutes to sharp intensity and seemed bound up with the direct perception that it was positively HE who was. The frames and squares of the great window were a kind of image, for him, of a kind of failure.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="过了几分钟，这个推断变得非常有理，好像与一种直觉有密切关系，可以肯定的是，那才是真正的他。大窗子的条条框框对他来说，就是一种失败的象征。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But an extraordinary impression dropped on me as I extracted a meaning from the boy's embarrassed back -- none other than the impression that I was not barred now.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，当我从那个男孩局促不安的背后感到某种含义的时候，我突然产生了一种非同寻常的感觉——不是别的，正是我现在不再蒙在鼓里的感觉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I felt that I saw him, at any rate, shut in or shut out. He was admirable, but not comfortable: I took it in with a throb of hope. Wasn't he looking, through the haunted pane, for something he couldn't see? -- And wasn't it the first time in the whole business that he had known such a lapse? The first, the very first: I found it a splendid portent.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="至少，我觉得自己能看到他被关在窗外或窗内。他令人羡慕，但并不舒服，我带着一丝希望这样理解。他不是正在透过幽灵出没的窗玻璃，寻找他看不到的东西吗？——而在整件事情中，这难道不是他第一次意识到了这样一个过失？第一次，真正的第一次，我感到这是一个极好的征兆。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It made him anxious, though he watched himself; he had been anxious all day and, even while in his usual sweet little manner he sat at table, had needed all his small strange genius to give it a gloss. When he at last turned round to meet me, it was almost as if this genius had succumbed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽然他举止小心，但我还是能看出这让他焦躁不安。他整天都处于焦虑中，即使是以惯常的可爱样子坐在桌前就餐时，他都要调动自己所有的智慧来保持优雅的餐桌礼仪。最后，当他转身面向我时，这种天赋似乎已经屈服了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, do you like it?" He stood there smiling; then at last he put into two words --"Do YOU?" -- More discrimination than I had ever heard two words contain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那你喜欢自由吗？”他站在那里微笑着，最后他用两个字来反问：“你呢？”——我从来没有听到过哪两个字包含如此多的歧视。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You would certainly seem to have seen, these twenty-four hours, a good deal more of it than for some time before. I hope!" I went on bravely, "that you've been enjoying yourself."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“在这24小时里，你肯定会把布莱看得比以前更清楚。我希望，”我继续大胆地说，“你玩得开心！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, yes, I've been ever so far; all round about -- miles and miles away. I've never been so free." He had really a manner of his own, and I could only try to keep up with him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，是的，到目前为止我一直是这样的，我四处闲游——到了数公里远的地方。我从来没有这么自由过。”他确实很有自己的一套，而我只能尽力跟上他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Before I had time to deal with that, however, he continued as if with the sense that this was an impertinence to be softened. "Nothing could be more charming than the way you take it, for of course if we're alone together now it's you that are alone most. But I hope," he threw in, "you don't particularly mind!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，我还没来得及应对，他好像就意识到了这样很鲁莽，应该缓和一下，他接着说道：“没有什么能比你对它的看法更有意义了，因为如果我们现在独处在一起，你会是最孤独的一个人。但我希望，”他又说道，“你不是特别介意！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, I think I'm glad Bly agrees with ME!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好吧，很高兴布莱还适合我呆下去！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Having to do with you?" I asked. "My dear child, how can I help minding? Though I've renounced all claim to your company -- you're so beyond me -- I at least greatly enjoy it. What else should I stay on for?" he looked at me more directly, and the expression of his face, graver now, struck me as the most beautiful I had ever found in it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“介意不得不跟你一起？”我问，“我亲爱的孩子，我怎会介意呢？虽然我已经放弃了跟你在一起的要求——你离我是那么地遥远——我至少还是很喜欢跟你在一起的。要不我还会为其他什么而留下来？”他更加直接地看着我，现在脸上的表情更加严肃，我从没有在他脸上发现过如此美丽的表情，这使我大为吃惊。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes, yes!" He, on his side, more and more visibly nervous, had a tone to master; but he was so much more successful than I that, laughing out through his gravity, he could pretend we were pleasantly jesting.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“记得，记得！”在他这一方面，他很明显越来越紧张，他需要控制自己的语调，但他比我要成功得多，他笑着，不再那么严肃，他能假装我们只是在愉快地开玩笑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我想，那只是为了让我给你做一点儿事情！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, yes," he said with the brightest superficial eagerness, "you wanted me to tell you something."</div>

<div class="line_en">"It was partly to get you to do something," I conceded. "But, you know, you didn't do it."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“是这样的。讲出来，直接讲出来。讲出你脑子里所想的事情，你知道的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Ah, then, is THAT what you've stayed over for?" he spoke with a gaiety through which I could still catch the finest little quiver of resentful passion; but I can't begin to express the effect upon me of an implication of surrender even so faint.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“啊，那么，这就是你留下来的原因？”他说得很欢快，不过我还是能从中捕捉到一丝憎恨的颤抖，但我不能流露出那种想要我屈服的暗示对我的影响，尽管那暗示很模糊。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"There couldn't be a better place or time." He looked round him uneasily, and I had the rare -- oh, the queer!-- Impression of the very first symptom I had seen in him of the approach of immediate fear. It was as if he were suddenly afraid of me -- which struck me indeed as perhaps the best thing to make him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不可能有比这更好的地点和时间了。”他心神不安地环顾他的四周，我有了罕见的——哦，是古怪的——感想，我从他身上看到了恐慌逼近的第一个征兆。他好像突然害怕起我来——这着实让我吃惊，也许他这样再好不过了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was as if what I had yearned for had come at last only to astonish me. "Well, yes -- I may as well make a clean breast of it. It was precisely for that." He waited so long that I supposed it for the purpose of repudiating the assumption on which my action had been founded; but what he finally said was: "Do you mean now -- here?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这就像我所渴望的东西，最终来临后却让我大吃一惊一样。“哦，是的——我也可以坦白。正是那个目的。”他等了很长时间，以至于我以为这是为了拒绝接受我通过发现的一些事实而作的假设，但最后他却说：“你的意思是现在——这里？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Awfully!" He smiled at me heroically, and the touching little bravery of it was enhanced by his actually flushing with pain. He had picked up his hat, which he had brought in, and stood twirling it in a way that gave me, even as I was just nearly reaching port, a perverse horror of what I was doing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“非常想！”他勇敢地冲我笑了笑。他的脸因痛苦而发红，而这更增加了他动人的勇敢。他拿起带进来的帽子，站在那里转它，他转帽子的方式，让我觉得即便我就要到达彼岸，但是我正在做的事情中却反常地可怕。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Yet in the very pang of the effort I felt it vain to try sternness, and I heard myself the next instant so gentle as to be almost grotesque. "You want so to go out again?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而就在这努力的打击下，我感觉到，试图严厉是没用的，而且我听到我自己接下来是特别温和，温和得近乎荒唐地说道：“那么你还想出去吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">To do it in ANY way was an act of violence, for what did it consist of but the obtrusion of the idea of grossness and guilt on a small helpless creature who had been for me a revelation of the possibilities of beautiful intercourse? Wasn't it base to create for a being so exquisite a mere alien awkwardness? I suppose I now read into our situation a clearness it couldn't have had at the time, for I seem to see our poor eyes already lighted with some spark of a prevision of the anguish that was to come. So we circled about, with terrors and scruples, like fighters not daring to close.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无论如何这是一种暴力的展示，因为对于一个本来可以与我很好交流的无助的孩子来说，这除了是他对粗野的想法和罪恶所进行的思想斗争，还能包含什么？对一个如此优雅的人来说，如此异常的不雅行为，难道不是可耻的吗？我想我现在认清了我们的处境，当时还没能做到，因为我似乎看见我们那可怜的眼睛闪动着一种光芒，预示着极度的痛苦即将来临的光芒。所以，我们带着恐惧和不安而周旋着，就像两个不敢相互接近的斗士。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">My insistence turned him from me and kept him once more at his window in a silence during which, between us, you might have heard a pin drop.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我的坚持让他转身离开我，又一次沉默地呆在窗边，我们之间静得连针掉在地上都能听见。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But it was for each other we feared! That kept us a little longer suspended and unbruised. "I'll tell you everything!" Miles said --"I mean I'll tell you anything you like. You'll stay on with me, and we shall both be all right, and I WILL tell you -- I WILL. But not now."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但我们害怕的是彼此！那使我们保持了较长的停顿，毫发未伤。“我会告诉你一切的！”迈尔斯说道，“我是说，我会告诉你你想知道的任何事情。你留下来和我一起，我俩一切都会好的，并且我会告诉你——我会的。但不是在现在。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, then, go to Luke, and I'll wait for what you promise. Only, in return for that, satisfy, before you leave me, one very much smaller request." He looked as if he felt he had succeeded enough to be able still a little to bargain. "Very much smaller --?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好吧，那么，去找卢克吧，我会等着你所许诺的事情。只是，作为报答，在你离开我之前，要满足我一个小小的要求。”他看起来好像感到自己足够成功了，还有讨价还价的余地，“很小的？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I had not yet reduced him to quite so vulgar a lie, and I felt proportionately ashamed. But, horrible as it was, his lies made up my truth. I achieved thoughtfully a few loops of my knitting.</div>
