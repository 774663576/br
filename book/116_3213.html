Since the death of Miss Crawley, Pitt and Lady Jane had been living down at Queen's Crawley, where Becky had gone as governess years before.

<div class="line_en">Rawdon had become fond of his sister-in-law because she was so kind to his son, and when the holiday was over, both he and his son were sad to leave. The ladies, however, said goodbye to each other with less sadness. Becky was keen to return to the bright lights of London. She was bored with the country and bored with the sweet and gentle Lady Jane, though of course she was careful not to reveal this, as she needed Lady Jane to present her at court. She was determined to climb the social ladder as high as she could, determined to show those proud, stiff-necked society women that she, Rebecca Sharp, daughter of a drawing-teacher, could outshine them all in social brilliance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="罗顿渐渐喜欢上他的大嫂，因为她对他的儿子很好。假期结束时，父子俩都舍不得离开。然而，两位女士道别就没有那么伤感了。贝姬渴望回到伦敦的灯火辉煌之中。她厌倦了乡下，也厌倦了温柔甜美的简女士。当然了，她很小心没有将厌倦之情显露出来，因为她需要简女士引见她入宫。她下定决心要尽她所能往上爬，让那些傲慢的、死心眼的贵妇们知道：她，丽贝卡·夏普，一名绘画教师的女儿，在任何社交场合上都能让她们黯然失色。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">While Becky was busily making new friends and new enemies, her former friend Amelia found her social circle was shrinking. Dobbin had gone to India, and her brother Joseph had returned to his job there soon after the Battle of Waterloo. Perhaps he had been afraid that his terrified flight from Brussels might be talked about and laughed at. However, he made an allowance to his parents of a hundred and twenty pounds a year, paid monthly through his London agent.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在贝姬忙于结交新朋友、树立新敌人之时，她以前的朋友阿梅莉亚发现自己的社交圈子越来越小了。多宾去了印度，她哥哥约瑟夫在滑铁卢战役后不久也回到那里工作。或许，他担心自己仓皇逃离布鲁塞尔的事可能会被人议论和耻笑。尽管如此，他每年给父母补贴一百二十英镑，通过他在伦敦的经纪人按月支付。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Amelia's whole life was centred on her son Georgy. She was extremely possessive about him, and wanted to do everything for him herself.

<div class="line_en">Amelia was not without admirers in her little social circle. She was not brilliant, nor clever, nor wise, nor very pretty, but men were always charmed by her. Perhaps it was her weakness and her sweet nature that made men want to protect her. But it was certain that young Mr Linton, the doctor's assistant, was her willing slave. He sat up through the night with Georgy during his childhood illnesses, and would call in at any time, without a fee, if Mrs Osborne was at all worried about her darling boy.</div>
