<div class="line_en">I don't suppose any of you have heard of Patusan? It doesn't matter. There are many stars in the sky that most people have never heard of, and which are of no importance to them anyway. Patusan was like one of these stars. It was occasionally mentioned by officials in Batavia, and it was known by name to a very few in the trading world. But nobody had ever been there, and, I suspect, nobody wanted to go there. That was where Stein arranged to send Jim. It was like sending him to the moon; he left his past world behind him, and started a completely new life.</div>

<div class="line_en">I didn't know the woman he had mentioned, but I learnt from Stein that she had been an intelligent, good-looking Dutch-Malay girl. She had married a worthless Portuguese man, who made her life extremely miserable. Because Stein felt sorry for her, he gave her husband a job, as manager of Stein &amp; Company's trading-post in Patusan. Unfortunately, the Portuguese, whose name was Cornelius, was dishonest and lazy, so the trading-post lost money. Now that the woman had died, Stein wanted to replace Cornelius, and he generously suggested offering the job to Jim.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我不认识他说的那位女子，但斯坦告诉了我一些她的事：她聪明、漂亮，是荷兰和马来西亚的混血。她嫁给了一个一无是处的葡萄牙男人，他毁了她的一辈子。斯坦可怜她，于是给她丈夫找了份活儿，在帕图桑管理斯坦公司的贸易站。不幸的是，那个名叫科尼利厄斯的葡萄牙人既爱耍滑头，又是个懒骨头，因此贸易站亏损了。既然现在这位女子已经不在人世，斯坦打算让其他人代替科尼利厄斯，他慷慨地提出把这份工作给吉姆。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Wonderful effect," said Jim by my side. "Worth seeing, isn't it?" He spoke proudly, and that made me smile. Did he feel he could control even the movements of the moon? He was in control of so many things in Patusan! Things that had once seemed as far beyond his control as the moon and the stars.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这景象多棒。”吉姆在我身边说，“值得一看吧？”他自豪地说。我微微一笑。他难道认为连月亮的移动也在他的控制中吗？他掌握着帕图桑的这么多东西！而这些事曾经就和月亮还有星星一样遥远，是他望尘莫及的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Patusan is an area of deep jungle, far up the river, about sixty kilometres from the sea. There is a native village of the same name. Behind the roofs of the native houses, you can see the forest, and behind that there are two steep hills very close together, separated by a narrow valley. I saw all this later, when I visited Jim in Patusan. We were standing outside the very fine house that he had built for himself, on a warm, silent evening, watching an almost full moon rise behind the black hills. Red, and round, and nearly perfect, it sailed slowly upwards between the sides of the valley, finally moving away above the hill-tops, like a soul escaping from a buried body.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="帕图桑在丛林深处，位于河流上游很远的地方，距离大海60公里。当地有一个同名的村子。越过村子的屋顶，可以看到后面的森林，森林背后是两座陡峭的山，挨得很近，中间有一条狭长的山谷。这些是我后来去帕图桑看望吉姆时见到的。那是个温暖、宁静的夜晚，我们站在他自己盖的那间精巧的屋子外面，看着一轮将满的月亮从黑黝黝的山上升起。圆月泛着红色，看上去近乎完美，在山谷中慢慢升起，最终跃出山顶，宛如灵魂从被埋葬的尸体中逃逸。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But Stein and I had no idea of this when we talked about sending him to Patusan. We both wanted to get him away, away from himself rather than anyone else. We knew he would be safer in a quiet, lonely place, with nobody who knew or cared about his past.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但斯坦和我商量把吉姆送去帕图桑时，我们从没有想过这些。我们都想把他送走，与其说让他远离其他人，不如说让他远离自己。我们知道，在一个宁静、孤独，谁都不知道，也不在乎他的过去的地方，他会更安全。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I must tell you, however, that I had another reason for sending him away. I was about to go home to England for a while, and I think I wanted, more than I myself realized at the time, to be free of him -- do you understand? -- before I left. I was going home, and he had come to me from there, with his miserable trouble and his shadowy dreams, like a man carrying something heavy on his tired shoulders in a thick mist. I cannot say I had ever seen him clearly, right up to the day when I had my last view of him. But the less I understood him, the closer I felt to him. After all, I did not know much more about myself. And then, I repeat, I was going home -- to that distant place we all come from. We, the famous and the unknown, travel in our thousands all over the world, earning beyond the seas our good name, our fortune or perhaps just enough bread for that day. But when we go home, we meet again our friends, our family, and others -- those whom we obey and those whom we love. More than that, we have to meet the soul of the country, that lives in its air, in its valleys, in its rivers and its trees -- a wordless friend and judge. To breathe in the peace of home, to be happy there, I think we have to return with a clear conscience. I know that Jim felt something of this. He would never go home now. Never! He could not bear the idea of it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但我必须告诉你们，当初我想把吉姆送走还有另一个原因。那时我正打算回英格兰老家待一段时间，所以希望在离开之前摆脱他，现在想想，当时这种想法强得我自己都没意识到——你们能理解吗？我就要动身回家了，可他却从英格兰来到我面前，带着痛苦的折磨和虚幻的梦想，就像一个在浓雾中用疲惫的肩膀扛着重物的人。直到最后一次见面我都不敢说我看清过他。但我对他了解越少，反而感觉越亲近。毕竟，我对自己也并不怎么了解。那么，我再说一遍，我当时正打算回家——我们都从那个遥远的地方而来。无论功成名就，还是默默无闻，我们都成群结队地奔赴大海彼岸，在世界各地为名声、财富，抑或只是足够当天填饱肚子的面包而打拼。但还乡之时，我们将见到朋友、家人和其他的人——那些我们遵从和热爱的人。更有甚者，我们还要再次感受这个国度的灵魂，它存活在空气、山谷、河流和树木中——它是一位无言的朋友与裁决者。为了感受到家的安宁，为了在那儿能快乐地生活，我想我们应当带着干干净净的良心回去。我知道吉姆也有这种感觉。事到如今，他永远都不会回去了。永远不会！连这么想想也让他受不了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And so, like a much older brother, I felt responsible for Jim. I was worried about what would happen to him. For example, he could start drinking. The world is small, and I was afraid of meeting him one day, in a foreign port, a red-eyed, dirty drunk, asking to borrow five dollars from me. You know how often that happens, when you can only just recognize a sadly changed figure from the past, who reappears in your life for a moment. That seemed the worst danger I could see for him or for me, but I knew I had no imagination. And Jim had plenty. People with imagination often go further than others in life, for good or evil. How could I tell what Jim would do?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因此，我像一个老大哥一样，深感自己对吉姆所负的责任。我担心他的将来。比如，他可能开始酗酒。世界这么小，我害怕某一天会在一个外国港口遇见他，一个脏兮兮的红眼睛醉汉向我要5美元。你们知道这种事情是很常见的，而那时你只能辨认出一个潦落不堪的昔日轮廓，在一瞬间重现在你的生命中。这是我预见到的对吉姆和我而言最糟糕的危险，虽然我知道自己没有什么想象力，但吉姆的想象力很丰富。想象力丰富的人在生活中总是走得比别人更远，或许是往好的方向走，或许是往坏的方向走。我怎么知道吉姆会做些什么呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">You see, I'm telling you so much about my fears for him because there is not much of the story left. I hear you ask, was I right to be afraid for him? I won't say. Perhaps you can decide, better than I can. Anyway, Jim did not go wrong, not at all. In fact, he developed wonderfully, and lived his life bravely and honestly to the end. I ought to be delighted, because I was closely involved in his success. But somehow I am not as pleased as I expected to be. I ask myself if he really managed to carry himself out of that mist in which I had seen him. And another thing, the last word has not been said -- will probably never be said. Our lives are too short for anyone to judge us fully. And we ourselves never have time to say our last word -- the last word of our love, our trust, our sadness, our guilt, our fight against the darkness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="你看，我一直在说我对他有这么多担心，因为剩下的故事不多了。我听见你们问，我是否应该这样为他担心。我不会回答。也许你们可以去判断，你们会判断得更好。不管怎样，吉姆没有走错，一点儿也没有。事实上，他走得非常好，一直勇敢而诚实地走到了生命的尽头。我应当感到高兴，因为我与他的成功有密切的关系。然而，我并没有像自己所料想的那样开心。我问自己，他真的从我看到他时包围他的那片雾气中走出来了吗？另外，他的一生还没有最后的定论——也许永远不会有。人生苦短，任何人都无法对我们做出全面的评判。而我们永远都没有时间为自己定论——表达我们的爱、信任、悲哀、罪恶感以及与黑暗的抗争。">查看中文翻译</div>

My words may not be enough to persuade you, as I'm afraid you people think more of your bodies than your imaginations. I don't want to be rude; it is sensible to have no dreams -- and safe -- and useful -- and boring. But surely, my friends, you too have known, once in your time, the brightness of life, the fire that burns in you so strongly and unexpectedly, then, too soon, disappears!</div>

<div class="line_en">Jim's fame never reached the outside world, of course, from a place so lonely and far from anywhere. At one time Patusan was famous for its pepper, and in the seventeenth century Dutch and English traders travelled far through the jungle in their desperate search for this valuable plant. These heroic adventurers did not care about disease, hunger or death. Some of them left their bones whitening in a distant land, so that companies at home could make fortunes selling pepper. For a hundred years, they sent back news of Patusan, describing its rivers and jungle, its natives and customs, and the great Sultan who controlled the fate of all who lived there.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当然，吉姆的名声从未传到外面的世界，他所在的地方太偏僻了，离哪儿都很遥远。帕图桑曾因胡椒名噪一时，在17世纪，荷兰和英国的商人深入丛林，不顾一切地寻找这种名贵的植物。这些英勇的探险者不畏疾病、饥饿和死亡。为了让家乡的公司通过贩卖胡椒赚取财富，他们中有些人埋骨于遥远的异乡。一百年里，他们向家乡送回帕图桑的消息，描述着这里的河流、丛林、土著人和当地的风俗习惯，以及掌控着每个居民命运的伟大的苏丹。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was Stein who told me all this. He was perfectly honest with me over the breakfast table that morning. It was an extremely dangerous place, where people could lose their lives at any time. This situation was mostly caused by Rajah Allang, the worst of the young Sultan's uncles. He controlled the river and the land around it, and, by robbing and murdering, made the local Malays fear and obey him. They could not get away, because they had nowhere to go and no way of escaping.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这些都是斯坦告诉我的。那天早上他在早餐桌上对我坦言那里是一个极其危险的地方，人们随时可能丧命。很多时候这是王公阿朗造成的，他是小苏丹的叔叔中最坏的一个。他控制着河流及其周围的土地，又通过抢夺和杀戮让当地的马来人畏惧并顺从他。他们无法离开，因为他们无处可去，也没有办法逃走。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I went back to my own ship, and Jim came to say goodbye to me there. I gave him a gun and two boxes of ammunition, in case he needed them. "The gun may help you to remain," I said, then corrected myself quickly, "may help you to get in, I mean." But Jim was not troubled by this. He thanked me warmly, shouted goodbye, and jumped into his own boat. As his boatmen rowed away, I suddenly noticed he had left the ammunition behind, and I ordered my men to get a boat into the water at once. Jim was making his men row like madmen, and we could not catch him before he reached Stein's ship. In fact, our two boats arrived at the same moment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我回到自己的船上，吉姆来向我告别。我给了他一杆枪和两盒子弹，以备不时之需。“枪也许能帮你活下来，”我说完又赶紧纠正，“我是说有枪或许能帮助你进去。”但吉姆对此毫不在乎。他热情洋溢地感谢我，大声和我道别，然后跳到自己的小船上。那船离开后，我突然发现他把子弹落下了，我命令手下立即划船去追。吉姆让船上的人发疯似地往前冲，所以直到他到达斯坦的船，我们才赶上他。实际上两艘船是同时到达的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Come back to what?" he asked absently.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“回来干什么呢？”他一脸茫然地问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We both stepped on to the deck, where I gave him the ammunition boxes. The ship was ready to sail. Stein's captain, a half-caste, spoke to me. He did not think Jim had any chance of survival, and was only prepared to take his passenger to the mouth of the river. "Anybody who goes further into Patusan will certainly die," he said. "Between you and me, your friend is already a dead man."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们都上了甲板，我把装子弹的盒子交给他。船准备启航了。斯坦的船长是一个混血儿，他和我聊了起来。他认为吉姆活不下来，他只准备把他的乘客带到河流入海口。“进入帕图桑的人都必死无疑，”他说，“咱们俩私下说，你的朋友已经是个死人了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Is it to be never, then?" I asked after a moment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那你永远不回来了？”过了一会儿，我问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Never," he repeated dreamily, then suddenly jumped up. "My God! Mr Stein's ship sails in two hours' time!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“永远不，”他心不在焉地重复着，然后突然跳了起来，“天啊！斯坦先生的船两个小时后就要开走了！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As my boat pulled away from the ship, I saw him high up on deck, in the light of the dying sun, waving to me. I heard, "You shall hear of me." Because the sun was in my eyes, I couldn't see him well -- it was my fate never to see him clearly -- but I must say he looked very unlike a dead man to me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当我的小船离开大船时，我看见他高高地站在甲板上，在落日的余辉中朝我挥手。我听见他说：“你会听到我的消息的。”因为迎着太阳，我看不清他——我注定永远都看不清他——但我必须说，在我看来，他一点儿都不像要死的样子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then, while the captain shouted his orders, and the sails rose around us, Jim and I stood alone together on deck, shook hands, and said our last hurried words to each other. I no longer felt annoyed with him, as I had sometimes done in the past. It was clear to me what miserable danger he was going into. I believe I called him "dear boy" and he called me "old man". For an unexpected, short moment we were very close.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后，船长大声发出命令，船帆在我们身边升起，吉姆和我在甲板上单独站在一起，相互握手，匆匆对彼此说了最后想说的话。他不再像以前那样让我感到烦恼。我很清楚他将面对怎样可怕的危险。我相信当时我叫他“亲爱的孩子”，他叫我“老伯”。在那一瞬间，我们出乎意料地亲近。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Don't worry," he said. "I promise to take care of myself. My God! Nothing can touch me. What a wonderful opportunity!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“别担心，”他说，“我保证会照顾好自己。老天！什么都不会伤害到我的。这是个多好的机会啊！”">查看中文翻译</div>
