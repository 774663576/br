<div class="line_en">'It looks as if we were coming to a village,' said the Mole somewhat dubiously, slackening his pace, as the track, that had in time become a path and then had developed into a lane, now handed them over to the charge of a well-metalled road. The animals did not hold with villages, and their own highways, thickly frequented as they were, took an independent course, regardless of church, post office, or public-house.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“看来，前面像是一个村庄，”鼹鼠放慢了脚步，疑疑惑惑地说。因为，那条被脚踩出来的小道，先是变成了一条小径，然后又扩大成一条树夹道，最后引他们走上了一条碎石子路。村庄不大合两只动物的口味，他们平时常常过往的公路，是另一股道，避开了教堂、邮局或酒店。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The sheep ran huddling together against the hurdles, blowing out thin nostrils and stamping with delicate fore-feet, their heads thrown back and a light steam rising from the crowded sheep-pen into the frosty air, as the two animals hastened by in high spirits, with much chatter and laughter. They were returning across country after a long day's outing with Otter, hunting and exploring on the wide uplands where certain streams tributary to their own River had their first small beginnings; and the shades of the short winter day were closing in on them, and they had still some distance to go. Plodding at random across the plough, they had heard the sheep and had made for them; and now, leading from the sheep-pen, they found a beaten track that made walking a lighter business, and responded, moreover, to that small inquiring something which all animals carry inside them, saying unmistakably, 'Yes, quite right; THIS leads home!'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="羊群紧紧挤在一起，薄薄的鼻孔喷着气，纤细的前蹄不停地跺着地面，仰着脑袋朝羊栏奔去。羊群里腾起一股蒸气，冉冉上升到寒冷的空气里。河鼠和鼹鼠边说边笑，兴冲冲地匆匆走过羊群。一整天。他们和水獭一道在广阔的高地上打猎探奇，那儿是注入他们那条大河的几条山洞的源头。现在他们正穿越田野往家走。冬天短短的白昼将尽，暮色向他们逼来，可他们离家还有相当的路程。他们正踉踉跄跄在耕地里乱走时，听到绵羊的哗哗声，就寻声走来。现在，他们看到从羊栏那边伸过来一条踩平的小道，路好走多了。而且，他们凭着所有的动物天生具有的那种嗅觉，准确地知道，“没错，这条路是通向家的！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">'Oh, never mind!' said the Rat. 'At this season of the year they're all safe indoors by this time, sitting round the fire; men, women, and children, dogs and cats and all. We shall slip through all right, without any bother or unpleasantness, and we can have a look at them through their windows if you like, and see what they're doing.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“噢，没关系，”河鼠说。“在这个季节，这个时辰，男人呀，女人呀，小孩呀，狗呀，猫呀，全都安安静静呆在家里烤火。咱们可以人不知鬼不觉地溜过去，不会惹事生非的。如果你愿意，咱们还可以从窗外偷瞧几眼，看看他们都在干什么。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The rapid nightfall of mid-December had quite beset the little village as they approached it on soft feet over a first thin fall of powdery snow. Little was visible but squares of a dusky orange-red on either side of the street, where the firelight or lamplight of each cottage overflowed through the casements into the dark world without. Most of the low latticed windows were innocent of blinds, and to the lookers-in from outside, the inmates, gathered round the tea-table, absorbed in handiwork, or talking with laughter and gesture, had each that happy grace which is the last thing the skilled actor shall capture-the natural grace which goes with perfect unconsciousness of observation. Moving at will from one theatre to another, the two spectators, so far from home themselves, had something of wistfulness in their eyes as they watched a cat being stroked, a sleepy child picked up and huddled off to bed, or a tired man stretch and knock out his pipe on the end of a smouldering log.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当他们迈着轻柔的脚步，踏着薄薄一层粉状的雪走进村庄时，十二月中旬迅速降临的黑夜已经笼罩了小小的村庄。除了街道两边昏暗的橘红色方块，几乎什么也看不见。透过那些窗子，每间农舍里的炉火光和灯光，涌流到外面黑洞洞的世界。这些低矮的格子窗，多半都不挂窗帘，屋里的人也不避讳窗外的看客。他们围坐在茶桌旁，一心一意在干手工活，或者挥动手臂大声说笑，人人都显得优雅自如，那正是技艺高超的演员所渴求达到的境界——丝毫没有意识到面对观众的一种自然境界。这两位远离自己家园的观众，随意从一家剧院看到另一家剧院。当他们看到一只猫被人抚摸，一个瞌睡的小孩被抱到床上，或者一个倦乏的男人伸懒腰，并在一段冒烟的木柴尾端磕打烟斗时，他们的眼睛里不由得露出某种渴望的神情。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But it was from one little window, with its blind drawn down, a mere blank transparency on the night, that the sense of home and the little curtained world within walls-the larger stressful world of outside Nature shut out and forgotten-most pulsated. Close against the white blind hung a bird-cage, clearly silhouetted, every wire, perch, and appurtenance distinct and recognisable, even to yesterday's dull-edged lump of sugar. On the middle perch the fluffy occupant, head tucked well into feathers, seemed so near to them as to be easily stroked, had they tried; even the delicate tips of his plumped-out plumage pencilled plainly on the illuminated screen. As they looked, the sleepy little fellow stirred uneasily, woke, shook himself, and raised his head. They could see the gape of his tiny beak as he yawned in a bored sort of way, looked round, and then settled his head into his back again, while the ruffled feathers gradually subsided into perfect stillness. Then a gust of bitter wind took them in the back of the neck, a small sting of frozen sleet on the skin woke them as from a dream, and they knew their toes to be cold and their legs tired, and their own home distant a weary way.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，有一扇拉上窗帘的小窗，在黑暗里，只显出半透明的一方空白。只有在这里，家的感觉，斗室内帷帘低垂的小天地的感觉，把外面的自然界那个紧张的大世界关在门外并且遗忘掉的感觉，才最为强烈、紧靠白色的窗帘，挂着一只鸟笼，映出一个清晰的剪影。每根铁丝，每副栖架，每件附属物，甚至昨天的一块舐圆了角的方糖，都清晰可辨、栖在笼子中央一根栖架上的那个毛茸茸的鸟儿，把头深深地埋在羽翼里，显得离他们很近，仿佛伸手就能摸到似的。他那圆滚滚的羽毛身子，甚至那些细细的羽尖，都像在那块发光的屏上描出来的铅笔画。正当他俩看着，那只睡意沉沉的小东西不安地动了动，醒了，他抖抖羽毛，昂起头。在他懒洋洋地打呵欠时，他们能看到他细小的喙张得大大的，他向四周看了看，又把头埋进翅下，蓬松的羽毛渐渐收拢，静止不动了。这时，一阵凛冽的风刮进他俩的后脖子，冰冷的雨雪刺痛了他们的皮肤，他们仿佛从梦中惊醒，感到脚趾发冷，两腿酸累，这才意识到，他们离自己的家还有一段长长的跋涉。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We others, who have long lost the more subtle of the physical senses, have not even proper terms to express an animal's inter-communications with his surroundings, living or otherwise, and have only the word 'smell,' for instance, to include the whole range of delicate thrills which murmur in the nose of the animal night and day, summoning, warning? inciting, repelling. It was one of these mysterious fairy calls from out the void that suddenly reached Mole in the darkness, making him tingle through and through with its very familiar appeal, even while yet he could not clearly remember what it was. He stopped dead in his tracks, his nose searching hither and thither in its efforts to recapture the fine filament, the telegraphic current, that had so strongly moved him. A moment, and he had caught it again; and with it this time came recollection in fullest flood.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们人类，久已失去了较细微的生理感觉，甚至找不到恰当的词汇，来形容一只动物与他的环境——有生命的或无生命的——之间那种息息相通的交流关系。比如说，动物的鼻孔内日夜不停地发出嗡嗡作响的一整套细微的颤动，如呼唤、警告、挑逗、排拒等等，我们只会用一个“嗅”字来概括。此刻，正是这样一种来自虚空的神秘的仙气般的呼声，透过黑暗，传到了鼹鼠身上。它那十分熟悉的呼吁，刺激得鼹鼠浑身震颤，尽管他一时还记不起那究竟是什么。走着走着。他忽然定在那儿，用鼻子到处嗅，使劲去捕捉那根细丝，那束强烈地触动了他的电流。只一会，他就捉住它了，随之而来的是狂潮般涌上心头的回忆。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Once beyond the village, where the cottages ceased abruptly, on either side of the road they could smell through the darkness the friendly fields again; and they braced themselves for the last long stretch, the home stretch, the stretch that we know is bound to end, some time, in the rattle of the door-latch, the sudden firelight, and the sight of familiar things greeting us as long-absent travellers from far over-sea. They plodded along steadily and silently, each of them thinking his own thoughts. The Mole's ran a good deal on supper, as it was pitch-dark, and it was all a strange country for him as far as he knew, and he was following obediently in the wake of the Rat, leaving the guidance entirely to him. As for the Rat, he was walking a little way ahead, as his habit was, his shoulders humped, his eyes fixed on the straight grey road in front of him; so he did not notice poor Mole when suddenly the summons reached him, and took him like an electric shock.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一出村庄，茅屋立时就没有了。在道路两旁，他们又闻到友好的田地的气息，穿过黑暗向他们扑来。于是他们打起精神，走上最后一段征途。这是回家的路，这段路，他们知道早晚是有尽头的。那时，门闩咔嚓一响，眼前突然出现炉火，熟悉的事物像迎接久别归来的海外游子一样欢迎他们。他们坚定地走着，默默不语，各想各的心事。鼹鼠一心想着晚饭。天已经全黑了，四周都是陌生的田野，所以他只管乖乖地跟在河鼠后面，由着河鼠给他带路。河鼠呢，他照常走在前面，微微佝偻着双肩，两眼紧盯着前面那条笔直的灰色道路。因此，他没怎么顾到可怜的鼹鼠。就在这当儿，一声召唤，如同电击一般，突然触到了鼹鼠。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Home! That was what they meant, those caressing appeals, those soft touches wafted through the air, those invisible little hands pulling and tugging, all one way! Why, it must be quite close by him at that moment, his old home that he had hurriedly forsaken and never sought again, that day when he first found the river! And now it was sending out its scouts and its messengers to capture him and bring him in. Since his escape on that bright morning he had hardly given it a thought, so absorbed had he been in his new life, in all its pleasures, its surprises, its fresh and captivating experiences. Now, with a rush of old memories, how clearly it stood up before him, in the darkness! Shabby indeed, and small and poorly furnished, and yet his, the home he had made for himself, the home he had been so happy to get back to after his day's work. And the home had been happy with him, too, evidently, and was missing him, and wanted him back, and was telling him so, through his nose, sorrowfully, reproachfully, but with no bitterness or anger; only with plaintive reminder that it was there, and wanted him.</div>

At last, however, when they had gone some considerable way further, and were passing some tree-stumps at the edge of a copse that bordered the road, he stopped and said kindly, 'Look here, Mole old chap, you seem dead tired.

Meanwhile, the wafts from his old home pleaded, whispered, conjured, and finally claimed him imperiously. He dared not tarry longer within their magic circle. With a wrench that tore his very heartstrings he set his face down the road and followed submissively in the track of the Rat, while faint, thin little smells, still dogging his retreating nose, reproached him for his new friendship and his callous forgetfulness.</div>

<div class="line_en">Still snuffling, pleading, and reluctant, Mole suffered himself to be dragged back along the road by his imperious companion, who by a flow of cheerful talk and anecdote endeavoured to beguile his spirits back and make the weary way seem shorter. When at last it seemed to the Rat that they must be nearing that part of the road where the Mole had been 'held up,' he said, 'Now, no more talking. Business! Use your nose, and give your mind to it.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="鼹鼠仍在抽鼻子，恳求，勉勉强强由着朋友把他强拽着往回走。河鼠一路滔滔不绝地给他讲故事，好提起他的情绪，使这段乏味的路程显得短些。后来，河鼠觉得他们似乎已经来到鼹鼠当初给“绊住”的地方，就说，“现在，别说话了，干正事！用你的鼻子，用你的心来找。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">'Hang River Bank, and supper too!' said the Rat heartily. 'I tell you, I'm going to find this place now, if I stay out all night. So cheer up, old chap, and take my arm, and we'll very soon be back there again.'</div>

<div class="line_en">The Rat, much excited, kept close to his heels as the Mole, with something of the air of a sleep-walker, crossed a dry ditch, scrambled through a hedge, and nosed his way over a field open and trackless and bare in the faint starlight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="河鼠特兴奋，亦步亦趋地紧跟在鼹鼠身后。鼹鼠像梦游者似的，在昏暗的星光下，跨过一条干涸的水沟，钻过一道树篱，用鼻子嗅着，横穿一片宽阔的、光秃秃没有路径的田野。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mole reached down a lantern from a nail on the wail and lit it, and the Rat, looking round him, saw that they were in a sort of fore-court. A garden-seat stood on one side of the door, and on the other a roller; for the Mole, who was a tidy animal when at home, could not stand having his ground kicked up by other animals into little runs that ended in earth-heaps. On the walls hung wire baskets with ferns in them, alternating with brackets carrying plaster statuary-Garibaldi, and the infant Samuel, and Queen Victoria, and other heroes of modern Italy. Down on one side of the forecourt ran a skittle-alley, with benches along it and little wooden tables marked with rings that hinted at beer-mugs. In the middle was a small round pond containing gold-fish and surrounded by a cockle-shell border. Out of the centre of the pond rose a fanciful erection clothed in more cockle-shells and topped by a large silvered glass ball that reflected everything all wrong and had a very pleasing effect.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="鼹鼠从墙上摘下一盏灯笼，点亮了，河鼠环顾四周，看到他们是在一个前庭里。门的一侧，摆着一张花园坐椅，另一侧，有个石磙子。这是因为，鼹鼠在家时爱好整洁，不喜欢别的动物把他的地面蹴出一道道足痕，踢成一个个小土堆。墙上，挂着几只金属丝篮子，插着些羊齿植物，花篮之间隔着些托架，上面摆着泥塑像——有加里波的，有年幼的萨缪尔，有维多利亚女王，还有其他意大利英雄们。在前庭的下首，有个九柱戏场，周围摆着条凳和小木桌，桌上印着一些圆圈，是摆啤酒杯的标志。庭院中央有个圆圆的小池塘，养着金鱼，四周镶着海扇贝壳砌的边。池塘中央，矗立着一座用海扇贝壳贴面的造型奇特的塔，塔顶是一只很大的银白色玻璃球，反照出来的东西全都走了样，怪滑稽的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was close and airless, and the earthy smell was strong, and it seemed a long time to Rat ere the passage ended and he could stand erect and stretch and shake himself. The Mole struck a match, and by its light the Rat saw that they were standing in an open space, neatly swept and sanded underfoot, and directly facing them was Mole's little front door, with 'Mole End' painted, in Gothic lettering, over the bell-pull at the side.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="地道很狭窄，憋闷，有股刺鼻的土腥味。河鼠觉得他们走了很久很久，才走到尽头，他才能直起腰来，伸展四肢，抖抖身子。鼹鼠划着一根火柴，借着火光，河鼠看到他们站在一块空地上。地面扫得于干净净，铺了一层沙子，正对他们的是鼹鼠家的小小前门，门旁挂着铃索，门的上方，漆着三个黑体字：“鼹鼠居”。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mole's face-beamed at the sight of all these objects so dear to him, and he hurried Rat through the door, lit a lamp in the hall, and took one glance round his old home. He saw the dust lying thick on everything, saw the cheerless, deserted look of the long-neglected house, and its narrow, meagre dimensions, its worn and shabby contents-and collapsed again on a hall-chair, his nose to his paws. 'O Ratty!' he cried dismally, 'why ever did I do it? Why did I bring you to this poor, cold little place, on a night like this, when you might have been at River Bank by this time, toasting your toes before a blazing fire, with all your own nice things about you!'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="看到这些亲切的物件，鼹鼠的脸上绽开了愉快的笑意。他把河鼠推进大门，点着了厅里的一盏灯，匆匆扫了一眼他的旧居。他看到，所有的东西都积满了厚厚的一层灰尘，看到长久被他遗忘的屋子的凄凉景象，看到它的开间是那么狭小，室内陈设又是那么简陋陈旧，禁不住又沮丧起来，颓然瘫倒在椅子上，双爪捂住鼻子。“鼠儿啊！”他悲悲戚戚地哭道，“我为什么要这么干？为什么在这样寒冷的深夜，把你拉到这个穷酸冰冷的小屋里来！要不然，你这时已经回到河岸，对着熊熊的炉火烤脚，周边都是你的那些好东西！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他走进储藏室，不多会儿又走出来，身上沾了点灰，两只爪子各握着一瓶啤酒，两腋下也各夹着瓶啤酒。“鼹鼠，看来你还是个挺会享受的美食家哩，”他评论说。“凡是好吃的，一样不少哇。这小屋比哪儿都叫人高兴。喂，这些画片，你打哪儿弄来的？挂上这些画，这小屋更显得像个家了。给咱说说，你是怎么把它布置成这个样儿？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then, while the Rat busied himself fetching plates, and knives and forks, and mustard which he mixed in an egg-cup, the Mole, his bosom still heaving with the stress of his recent emotion, related-somewhat shyly at first, but with more freedom as he warmed to his subject-how this was planned, and how that was thought out, and how this was got through a windfall from an aunt, and that was a wonderful find and a bargain, and this other thing was bought out of laborious savings and a certain amount of 'going without.' His spirits finally quite restored, he must needs go and caress his possessions, and take a lamp and show off their points to his visitor and expatiate on them, quite forgetful of the supper they both so much needed; Rat, who was desperately hungry but strove to conceal it, nodding seriously, examining with a puckered brow, and saying, 'wonderful,' and 'most remarkable,' at intervals, when the chance for an observation was given him.</div>

With bright beady eyes they glanced shyly at each other, sniggering a little, sniffing and applying coat-sleeves a good deal. As the door opened, one of the elder ones that carried the lantern was just saying, 'Now then, one, two, three!' and forthwith their shrill little voices uprose on the air, singing one of the old-time carols that their forefathers composed in fields that were fallow and held by frost, or when snow-bound in chimney corners, and handed down to be sung in the miry street to lamp-lit windows at Yule-time.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Rat, meanwhile, was busy examining the label on one of the beer-bottles. 'I perceive this to be Old Burton,' he remarked approvingly. 'SENSIBLE Mole! The very thing! Now we shall be able to mull some ale! Get the things ready, Mole, while I draw the corks.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时，河鼠在忙着细看啤酒瓶上的商标。“看得出来，这是老伯顿牌的，”他赞许地评论说。“鼹鼠很识货呀！是地道货！现在我们可以用它来调热甜酒了！鼹鼠，准备好家什，我来拔瓶塞。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The rest of the field-mice, perched in a row on the settle, their small legs swinging, gave themselves up to enjoyment of the fire, and toasted their chilblains till they tingled; while the Mole, failing to draw them into easy conversation, plunged into family history and made each of them recite the names of his numerous brothers, who were too young, it appeared, to be allowed to go out a-carolling this year, but looked forward very shortly to winning the parental consent.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="其余的田鼠，在条凳上坐成一排，小腿儿悬挂着，前后摆动，尽情享受炉火的温暖。他们在火上烤脚上的冻疮，直烤得刺痒痒的。鼹鼠想引着他们无拘无束地谈话，可没成功，就讲起家史来，要他们逐个儿报自己那许多弟弟的名字、看来，他们的弟弟因为年纪还小，今年还不让出门唱圣诞歌，不过也许不久就能获得父母的恩准。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It did not take long to prepare the brew and thrust the tin heater well into the red heart of the fire; and soon every field-mouse was sipping and coughing and choking (for a little mulled ale goes a long way) and wiping his eyes and laughing and forgetting he had ever been cold in all his life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="甜酒很快就调好了，于是把盛酒的锡壶深深插进红红的火焰里；不一会，每只田鼠都在啜着，咳着，呛着（因为一点点热甜酒劲头就够大的），又擦眼泪，又笑，忘记了他们这辈子曾经挨冻来着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">'They act plays too, these fellows,' the Mole explained to the Rat. 'Make them up all by themselves, and act them afterwards. And very well they do it, too! They gave us a capital one last year, about a field-mouse who was captured at sea by a Barbary corsair, and made to row in a galley; and when he escaped and got home again, his lady-love had gone into a convent. Here, YOU! You were in it, I remember. Get up and recite a bit.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这些小家伙还会演戏哩，”鼹鼠向河鼠介绍说。“戏全是由他们自编自演的。演得还真棒！去年，他们给我们演了一出精彩的戏，讲的是一只田鼠，在海上被北非的海盗船俘虏了，被迫在船舱里划桨。后来他逃了出来，回到家乡时，他心爱的姑娘却进了修道院。喂，你！你参加过演出的，我记得。站起来，给咱们朗诵一段台词吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The field-mouse addressed got up on his legs, giggled shyly, looked round the room, and remained absolutely tongue-tied. His comrades cheered him on, Mole coaxed and encouraged him, and the Rat went so far as to take him by the shoulders and shake him; but nothing could overcome his stage-fright. They were all busily engaged on him like watermen applying the Royal Humane Society's regulations to a case of long submersion, when the latch clicked, the door opened, and the field-mouse with the lantern reappeared, staggering under the weight of his basket.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那只被点名的田鼠站起来，害羞地格格笑着，朝四周扫了一眼，却张口结舌，一句也念不出。同伴们给他打气，鼹鼠哄他，鼓励他，河鼠甚至抓住他的肩膀一个劲摇晃，可什么都不管用，他硬是摆脱不了上场昏。他们围着他团团转，就像一帮子水手，按照皇家溺水者营救协会的规则，抢救一个长时间溺水的人那样。这时，门闩卡嗒一声，门开了，打灯笼的田鼠被沉甸甸的篮子压得趔趔趄趄，走了进来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was no more talk of play-acting once the very real and solid contents of the basket had been tumbled out on the table. Under the generalship of Rat, everybody was set to do something or to fetch something. In a very few minutes supper was ready, and Mole, as he took the head of the table in a sort of a dream, saw a lately barren board set thick with savoury comforts; saw his little friends' faces brighten and beam as they fell to without delay; and then let himself loose-for he was famished indeed-on the provender so magically provided, thinking what a happy home-coming this had turned out, after all. As they ate, they talked of old times, and the field-mice gave him the local gossip up to date, and answered as well as they could the hundred questions he had to ask them. The Rat said little or nothing, only taking care that each guest had what he wanted, and plenty of it, and that Mole had no trouble or anxiety about anything.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="等到篮子里那些实实在在的东西一股脑倾倒在餐桌上时，演戏的事就再也没人提了。在河鼠的调度下，每只动物都动手去干某件事或取某件东西。不消几分钟，晚饭就准备停当。鼹鼠仿佛做梦似的，在餐桌主位坐定，看到刚才还是空荡荡的桌面，现在堆满了美味佳肴，看到他的小朋友们个个喜形于色，迫不及待地狼吞虎咽，他自己也放开肚皮大嚼那些魔术般变出来的食物。他心想，这次回家，想不到结果竟如此圆满。他们边吃边谈，说些往事。田鼠们告诉他最近的当地新闻，还尽力回答他提出的上百个问题。河鼠很少说话，只关照客人们各得所需，多多享用，好让鼹鼠一切不必操心。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They clattered off at last, very grateful and showering wishes of the season, with their jacket pockets stuffed with remembrances for the small brothers and sisters at home. When the door had closed on the last of them and the chink of the lanterns had died away, Mole and Rat kicked the fire up, drew their chairs in, brewed themselves a last nightcap of mulled ale, and discussed the events of the long day. At last the Rat, with a tremendous yawn, said, 'Mole, old chap, I'm ready to drop. Sleepy is simply not the word. That your own bunk over on that side? Very well, then, I'll take this. What a ripping little house this is! Everything so handy!'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后，田鼠们卿卿喳喳，一迭连声地道谢，又祝贺主人节日愉快，告辞离去了，他们的衣兜里都塞满了纪念品，那是带给家里的小弟妹们的。等送走最后一位客人，大门关上，灯笼的叮咚声渐渐远去时，鼹鼠和河鼠把炉火拨旺，拉过椅子来，给自己热好睡前的最后一杯甜酒，就议论起这长长的一天里发生的事情。末了，河鼠打了个大大的呵欠，说，“鼹鼠，老朋友，我实在累得要死啦。‘瞌睡’这个词儿远远不够了。你自己的床在那边是吧？那我就睡这张床了。这小屋真是妙极了！什么都特方便顺手！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The weary Mole also was glad to turn in without delay, and soon had his head on his pillow, in great joy and contentment. But ere he closed his eyes he let them wander round his old room, mellow in the glow of the firelight that played or rested on familiar and friendly things which had long been unconsciously a part of him, and now smilingly received him back, without rancour. He was now in just the frame of mind that the tactful Rat had quietly worked to bring about in him. He saw clearly how plain and simple-how narrow, even-it all was; but clearly, too, how much it all meant to him, and the special value of some such anchorage in one's existence. He did not at all want to abandon the new life and its splendid spaces, to turn his back on sun and air and all they offered him and creep home and stay there; the upper world was all too strong, it called to him still, even down there, and he knew he must return to the larger stage. But it was good to think he had this to come back to; this place which was all his own, these things which were so glad to see him again and could always be counted upon for the same simple welcome.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="倦乏的鼹鼠也巴不得快点睡觉，马上就把脑袋倒在枕头上，觉得非常舒心快意。不过在合眼之前，他还要环视一下自己的房间。在炉火的照耀下，这房间显得十分柔和温煦。火光闪烁，照亮了他所熟悉的友好的物件。这些东西早就不知不觉成了他的一部分，现在都在笑眯眯毫无怨言地欢迎他回来。他现在的心境，正是机敏的河鼠不声不响引他进入的那种状态。他清楚地看到，他的家是多么平凡简陋，多么狭小，可同时也清楚，它们对他有多么重要，在他的一生中，这样的一种避风港具有多么特殊的意义。他并不打算抛开新的生活和明朗的广阔天地，不打算离开阳光空气和它们赐予他的一切欢乐，爬到地下，呆在家里。地面世界的吸引力太强大了，就是在地下，也仍不断地召唤着他。他知道，他必须回到那个更大的舞台上去。不过，有这么个地方可以回归，总是件好事。这地方完全是属于他的，这些物件见到他总是欢天喜地，不管他什么时候回来，总会受到同样亲切的接待。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He clambered into his bunk and rolled himself well up in the blankets, and slumber gathered him forthwith, as a swathe of barley is folded into the arms of the reaping machine.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="河鼠爬进他的床铺，用毯子把自己紧紧裹住，立刻沉入了梦乡的怀抱，就像一行大麦落进了收割机的怀抱一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
