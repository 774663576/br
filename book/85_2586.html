<div class="line_en">The damage done by Eddie's father was, at the beginning, the damage of neglect. As an infant, Eddie was rarely held by the man, and as a child, he was mostly grabbed by the arm, less with love than with annoyance. Eddie's mother handed out the tenderness; his father was there for the discipline.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="起初，爱迪的父亲对他的伤害是忽略。爱迪幼时，他父亲就很少抱他。等他长大一点，他通常会彼父前扭住胳膊，这多半是出于厌烦而不是爱。爱迪的母亲给予孩子们的是温存，而他的父亲只会教训他们。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On Saturdays, Eddie's father took him to the pier. Eddie would leave the apartment with visions of carousels and globs of cotton candy, but after an hour or so, his father would find a familiar face and say, "Watch the kid for me, will ya?" Until his father returned, usually late in the afternoon, often drunk, Eddie stayed in the custody of an acrobat or an animal trainer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="星期六，爱迪的父亲会带他到码头上去。离开家的时候，爱迪脑子里想像着旋转木马和棉花糖，但是。差不多一个钟头之后，他父亲就会找到一张熟悉的面孔，说“给我看着点这孩子。行吗？”在他父亲回来接他之前，那通常是在下午很迟的时候。他还经常醉醺醺的，爱迪便一直跟某个杂技演员或者驯兽员待在一起。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Still, for countless hours of his boardwalk youth, Eddie waited for his father's attention, sitting on railings or squatting in his short pants atop tool chests in the repair shop. Often he'd say, "I can help, I can help!" but the only job entrusted him was crawling beneath the Ferris wheel in the morning, before the park opened, to collect the coins that had fallen from customers' pockets the night before.</div>

<div class="line_en">At least four evenings a week, his father played cards. The table had money, bottles., cigarettes, and rules. Eddie's rule was simple: Do not disturb. Once he tried to stand next to his father and look at his cards, but the old man put down his cigar and erupted like thunder, smacking Eddie's face with the back of his hand. "Stop breathing on me," he said. Eddie burst into tears and his mother pulled him to her waist, glaring at her husband. Eddie never got that close again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他父亲一周起码玩四个晚上的纸牌。桌子上摆着钞票、酒瓶、香烟和游戏规则。给爱迪的规则很简单：不许打扰。有一次，他站在父亲身边。想看一看他的牌，但是，老家伙把雪茄一放，大发雷霆。用手背掴了爱迪一记耳光。‘别往我身上哈气，“他说道。爱迪大哭起来，母亲把他拉到腰间，愤怒地瞪着丈夫。爱迪再不往前靠了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Other nights, when the cards went bad and the bottles had been emptied and his mother was already asleep, his father brought his thunder into Eddie and Joe's bedroom. He raked through the meager toys, hurling them against the wall. Then he made his sons lie facedown on the mattress while he pulled off his belt and lashed their rear ends, screaming that they were wasting his money on junk. Eddie used to pray for his mother to wake up, but even the times she did, his father warned her to "stay out of it." Seeing her in the hallway, clutching her robe, as helpless as he was, made it all even worse.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="手气不好的晚上，待酒瓶见底了，母亲睡下了，他父亲就会把一肚子气带到爱迪和乔的卧室里。他翻腾他们的几件破玩具。将它们狠狠地摔到墙上。然后，他让两个儿子趴在床垫上。抽出皮带来打他们的屁股，大声嚷嚷，说他们浪费他的钱买破烂。爱迪总是祈望母亲能够醒过来，但是，即使她真的醒来了，父亲也会警告她“离远点”。见到母亲站在走廊里，手揪着睡袍，跟他一样无助的样子。爱迪觉得心里更难受。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The hands on Eddie's childhood glass then were hard and calloused and red with anger, and he went through his younger years whacked, lashed, and beaten. This was the second damage done, the one after neglect. The damage of violence. It got so that Eddie could tell by the thump of the footsteps coming down the hall how hard he was going to get it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="握在爱迪童年的玻璃杯上的那双手坚硬，布满老茧。被怒火烧得通红，爱迪就在挨耳光、受鞭挞和遭棍打中度过了他的童年。这是被忽略之后的第二重伤害。暴力伤害。最后，爱迪甚至能从走廊里传来的咚咚脚步声中判断出，他要挨多重的打。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Through it all, despite it all, Eddie privately adored his old man, because sons will adore their fathers through even the worst behavior. It is how they learn devotion. Before he can devote himself to God or a woman, a boy will devote himself to his father, even foolishly, even beyond explanation.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尽管如此。爱迪依然默默地崇拜他的父亲。因为儿子们永远崇拜他们的父亲，连最恶劣的行为也能够容忍。他们就是这样学会献身的。一个男孩子在将自己献身给上帝或者一个女人之前，他会将自己献身给他的父亲，虽然愚蠢，虽然无法解释。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And on Occasion, as if to feed the weakest embers of a fire, Eddie's father let a wrinkle of pride crack the veneer of his disinterest. At the baseball field by the 14th Avenue schoolyard, his father stood behind the fence, watching Eddie play. If Eddie smacked the ball to the outfield, his father nodded, and when he did, Eddie leaped around the bases. Other times, when Eddie came home from an alley fight, his father would notice his scraped knuckles or split lip. He would ask, "What happened to the other guy?" and Eddie would say he got him good. This, too, met with his father's approval. When Eddie attacked the kids who were bothering his brother --"the hoodlums," his mother called them -- Joe was ashamed and hid in his room, but Eddie's father said, "Never mind him. You're the strong one. Be your brother's keeper. Don't let nobody touch him."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="偶尔地。就像在奄奄一息的火堆上添一把木炭。爱迪的父亲会让一丝自豪透过他冷漠的外表流露出来。在十四街学校操场旁边的棒球场上，他父亲站在栅栏后面看他打球。如果爱迪把球击到了外场，他父亲就会点点头，爱迪便蹦蹦跳跳地绕场把垒跑完。另一些时候。爱迪巷战之后回到家里，他父亲注意到他指关节上擦破的皮肤或撕裂的嘴唇。他会问：“那个家伙怎么样了？”爱迪会说，他好好地收拾了那家伙一顿。这一点，也会赢得他父亲的赞同。那一次。当爱迪把惹他哥哥的几个孩子揍了一顿之后——他母亲管他们叫“阿飞”——乔觉得很没面子，躲在房间里，爱迪的父亲却说：”别理他。你更壮实。你要做你哥哥的保护人。别让任何人碰他。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When Eddie started junior high, he mimicked his father's summer schedule, rising before the sun, working at the park until nightfall. At first, he ran the simpler rides, maneuvering the brake levers, bringing train cars to a gentle stop. In later years, he worked in the repair shop. Eddie's father would test him with maintenance problems. He'd hand him a broken steering wheel and say, "Fix it." He'd point out a tangled chain and say, "Fix it." He'd carry over a rusty fender and some sandpaper and say, "Fix it." And every time, upon completion of the task, Eddie would walk the item back to his father and say, "It's fixed."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱迪开始上初中了，他模仿他父亲的夏日作息时间，天不亮就起身，在游乐场里一直工作到天黑。起初，他操作一些简单的游乐车，扳刹车杆。让车平缓地停下。后来，他在修理车间工作。他父亲拿关于维修的问题考他。他会把一个破损的方向盘交给他，说；“把它修好。”他会指着一根缠在起的链条。说：“把它修好。”他会拿过来一片生锈的挡泥板和几张砂纸。说：“把它修好。”，每次完成任务以后，爱迪就会把东西拿回去交给他父亲。说：”修好了。”。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At night they would gather at the dinner table, his mother plump and sweating, cooking by the stove, his brother, Joe, talking away, his hair and skin smelling from seawater. Joe had become a good swimmer, and his summer work was at the Ruby Pier pool. Joe talked about all the people he saw there, their swimsuits, their money. Eddie's father was not impressed. Once Eddie overheard him talking to his mother about Joe. "That one," he said, "ain't tough enough for anything but water."</div>

<div class="line_en">Still, Eddie envied the way his brother looked in the evenings, so tanned and clean. Eddie's fingernails, like his father's, were stained with grease, and at the dinner table Eddie would flick them with his thumbnail, trying to get the dirt out. He caught his father watching him once and the old man grinned.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是。爱迪仍然羡慕他哥哥晚上回到家时的样子，皮肤黝黑。干干净净。爱迪的指甲。像他父亲的一样，沾满了油腻。在餐桌上，爱迪会用大拇指的指甲去抠，想把油腻弄出来。有一次，他注意到父亲在看他，老家伙咧嘴笑了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">By this point -- already a strapping teenager -- Eddie only nodded back. Unbeknownst to him, he had begun the ritual of semaphore with his father, forsaking words or physical affection. It was all to be done internally. "You were just supposed to know it, that's all. Denial of affection. The damage done.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时，已经长成一个魁梧少年的爱迪，只是点点头。他并不知道，自己其实已经开始跟父亲打起旗语来了，他不再从他那里寻求任何言词上或者身体上的疼爱了。这是一种内心的变化。你只要心知肚明就够了。这是对疼爱的拒绝。伤害已经造成了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And then, one night, the speaking stopped altogether. This was after the war, when Eddie had been released from the hospital and the cast had been removed from his leg and he had moved back into the family apartment on Beachwood Avenue. His father had been drinking at the nearby pub and he came home late to find Eddie asleep on the couch. The darkness of combat had left Eddie changed. He stayed indoors. He rarely spoke, even to Marguerite. He spent hours staring out the kitchen window, watching the carousel ride, rubbing his bad knee. His mother whispered that he "just needed time," but his father grew more agitated each day. He didn't understand depression. To him it was weakness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后，一天晚上，他们之间的交谈完全停止了。那是战争之后，爱迪出院了。腿的石膏已经拆掉，他搬回了滨林路上的家里。他父亲在附近一家酒吧喝完酒，很晚才回到家里，发现爱迪睡在沙发上。战争的黑暗将爱迪改变了。他闭门不出，沉默寡言，甚至很少跟玛格丽特讲话。他连着几个钟头凝视厨房窗外，一边望着旋转木马，一边揉搓他坏死的膝盖。他母亲总是悄声地说，他”需要时间，”他父亲却一天比一天恼火。他不理解抑郁。对他来讲，抑郁就是软弱。">查看中文翻译</div>

She begged and wept and beseeched her husband to change his mind, to let it go, but Eddie's father would only say to her, through a clenched jaw, what he said to others who made the same request: "That boy raised a hand to me." And that was the end of the conversation.</div>

Emile had earned his wealth quickly, from investments in lumber and steel. He was a spender, a risk taker -- he went over the boards when he got an idea. I suppose that is why he was drawn to a poor girl like me. He abhorred those who were born into wealth, and rather enjoyed doing things the 'sophisticated people' would never do.</div>
