<div class="line_en">Rhett never deviated from his smooth, imperturbable manners, even in their most intimate moments. But Scarlett never lost the old feeling that he was watching her covertly, knew that if she turned her head suddenly she would surprise in his eyes that speculative, waiting look, that look of almost terrible patience that she did not understand.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sometimes, he was a very comfortable person to live with, for all his unfortunate habit of not permitting anyone in his presence to act a lie, palm off a pretense or indulge in bombast. He listened to her talk of the store and the mills and the saloon, the convicts and the cost of feeding them, and gave shrewd hard-headed advice. He had untiring energy for the dancing and parties she loved and an unending supply of coarse stories with which he regaled her on their infrequent evenings alone when the table was cleared and brandy and coffee before them. She found that he would give her anything she desired, answer any question she asked as long as she was forthright, and refuse her anything she attempted to gain by indirection, hints and feminine angling. He had a disconcerting habit of seeing through her and laughing rudely.</div>

<div class="line_en">Contemplating the suave indifference with which he generally treated her, Scarlett frequently wondered, but with no real curiosity, why he had married her. Men married for love or a home and children or money but she knew he had married her for none of these things. He certainly did not love her. He referred to her lovely house as an architectural horror and said he would rather live in a well-regulated hotel than a home. And he never once hinted about children as Charles and Frank had done. Once when trying to coquet with him she asked why he married her and was infuriated when he replied with an amused gleam in his eyes: "I married you to keep you for a pet, my dear."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="瑞德总是对她采取漠不关心的态度，思嘉想到这一点，往往觉得纳闷，这倒也不是由于好奇，但真是明白他为什么和她结婚。男人结婚，有的是为了爱情，有的是为了建立家庭，生儿育女，有的是为了金钱。但是思嘉知道，瑞德和她结婚完全不是为了这个原因。他肯定是不爱她的。他说她这所心爱的房子是一座可怕的建筑，还说宁愿住在一家经营有方的饭店里，也不愿意住在这家里。他与查理和弗兰克不一样，从来没有表示愿意要个孩子。有一次，她挑逗他，问他为什么和她结婚，他两眼流露出喜悦的神情，答道：“我和你结婚，是要把你当作一件心爱的东西留在身边，我的宝贝。”这话使得思嘉大为恼火。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">No, he hadn't married her for any of the usual reasons men marry women. He had married her solely because he wanted her and couldn't get her any other way. He had admitted as much the night he proposed to her. He had wanted her, just as he had wanted Belle Watling. This was not a pleasant thought. In fact, it was a barefaced insult. But she shrugged it off as she had learned to shrug off all unpleasant facts. They had made a bargain and she was quite pleased with her side of the bargain. She hoped he was equally pleased but she did not care very much whether he was or not.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他和思嘉结婚，的确不是由于一般说来男人和女人结婚的那些原因。他和她结婚，完全是因为他想占有她，靠别的办法，他是不可能得到她的。他向她求婚的那天晚上，他就已经如实地招认了。他想占有她，就像过去他想占有贝尔·沃特琳一样。这种联系真令人不快。实际上，这这完全是一种侮辱。但是思嘉已经学会对任何不愉快的事耸耸肩，就算了，因此对这件事也就耸了耸肩，算了。不管怎么说，他们已经做成了交易，而且就她这一方面的情况来说，她是满意的。她希望他也同样是满意的，不过他究竟满意不满意，她也并不怎么关心。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">To one person in the house it was not a happy day. Scolded and for the most part ignored, Wade Hampton idled miserably about the dining room. Early that morning, Mammy had waked him abruptly, dressed him hurriedly and sent him with Ella to Aunt Pitty's house for breakfast. The only explanation he received was that his mother was sick and the noise of his playing might upset her. Aunt Pitty's house was in an uproar, for the news of Scarlett's sickness had sent the old lady to bed in a state with Cookie in attendance, and breakfast was a scant meal that Peter concocted for the children. As the morning wore on fear began to possess Wade's soul. Suppose Mother died? Other boys' mothers had died. He had seen the hearses move away from the house and heard his small friends sobbing. Suppose Mother should die? Wade loved his mother very much, almost as much as he feared her, and the thought of her being carried away in a black hearse behind black horses with plumes on their bridles made his small chest ache so that he could hardly breathe.</div>

<div class="line_en">When noon came and Peter was busy in the kitchen, Wade slipped out the front door and hurried home as fast as his short legs could carry him, fear speeding him. Uncle Rhett or Aunt Melly or Mammy surely would tell him the truth. But Uncle Rhett and Aunt Melly were not to be seen and Mammy and Dilcey sped up and down the back stairs with towels and basins of hot water and did not once notice him in the front hall. From upstairs he could hear occasionally the curt tones of Dr. Meade whenever a door opened. Once he heard his mother groan and he burst into sobbing hiccoughs. He knew she was going to die. For comfort, he made overtures to the honey-colored cat which lay on the sunny window sill in the front hall. But Tom, full of years and irritable at disturbances, switched his tail and spat softly.</div>

<div class="line_en">But Wade did not go. He retreated behind the portieres in the hall, only half convinced by her words. The remark about the troublesomeness of boys stung, for he had always tried his best to be good. Aunt Melly hurried down the stairs half an hour later, pale and tired but smiling to herself. She looked thunderstruck when she saw his woebegone face in the shadows of the drapery. Usually Aunt Melly had all the time in the world to give him.

After the door shut behind the doctor, Uncle Rhett came swiftly into the dining room and poured himself a large drink from the decanter before he saw Wade. Wade shrank back, expecting to be told again that he was naughty and must return to Aunt Pitty's, but instead, Uncle Rhett smiled. Wade had never seen him smile like that or look so happy and, encouraged, he leaped from the sill and ran to him.</div>

<div class="line_en">Wade slipped into the quiet dining room, his small and insecure world tottering. Was there no place for a worried little seven-year-old boy on this sunshiny day when the grown-ups acted so curiously? He sat down on the window still in the alcove and nibbled a bit of the elephant's ear which grew in a box in the sun. It was so peppery that it stung his eyes to tears and he began to cry. Mother was probably dying, nobody paid him any heed and one and all, they rushed about because of a new baby -- a girl baby. Wade had little interest in babies, still less in girls. The only little girl he knew intimately was Ella and, so far, she had done nothing to command his respect or liking.</div>

<div class="line_en">The novelty of fatherhood did not wear off. This caused some secret envy among women whose husbands took offspring for granted, long before the children were christened. He buttonholed people on the street and related details of his child's miraculous progress without even prefacing his remarks with the hypocritical but polite: "I know everyone thinks their own child is smart but --" He thought his daughter marvelous, not to be compared with lesser brats, and he did not care who knew it. When the new nurse permitted the baby to suck a bit of fat pork, thereby bringing on the first attack of colic, Rhett's conduct sent seasoned fathers and mothers into gales of laughter. He hurriedly summoned Dr. Meade and two other doctors, and with difficulty he was restrained from beating the unfortunate nurse with his crop. The nurse was discharged and thereafter followed a series of nurses who remained, at the most, a week. None of them was good enough to satisfy the exacting requirements Rhett laid down.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他做父样的新鲜感迟迟没有消退。这使得有些女人暗中羡慕，因为她们生了孩子，还没有受洗礼，她们的丈夫早就认为生儿育女是理所当然的事了。他在街上不论遇见什么人，就没完同说地详细对人家说他的女儿又创造了什么奇迹，开头也不先说一句虚伪的客气话：“我知道人人都觉得自己的孩子好，不过——”他认为自己的女儿很出众，不是一般人的孩子可比，而且逢人便说。一个新来的女仆让孩子吃了一点肥肉，引起了头一次剧烈的肚子疼，瑞德的反应使得有经验的父母大笑不止。他连忙请来了米德大夫，还请了另外两位大夫，人们费了很大的劲，才拦住他没有用鞭子抽那个可怜的女仆。这个女仆马上被辞退了，随后又来了几个，最长也只能待一个礼拜。因为瑞德定下的苛刻条件，她们谁也满足不了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Even before Scarlett was able to be about again, she noticed Rhett's pre-occupation with the baby and was somewhat nettled and embarrassed at his pride in her in front of callers. It was all very well for a man to love his child but she felt there was something unmanly in the display of such love. He should be offhand and careless, as other men were.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="思嘉还没能够起来活动的时候，就发现瑞德过多地关心这个孩子，他总当着客人的面炫耀自己的女儿，使思嘉感到不快乐，也觉得难为情，一个男人喜欢自己的孩子，本是无可非议的，但是她觉得瑞德表露出这么多的感情，很缺乏男子汉的气概。他应该像别的男人那样，随便一点，自然一点。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mammy likewise viewed with displeasure the nurses that came and went, for she was jealous of any strange negro and saw no reason why she could not care for the baby and Wade and Ella, too. But Mammy was showing her age and rheumatism was slowing her lumbering tread. Rhett lacked the courage to cite these reasons for employing another nurse. He told her instead that a man of his position could not afford to have only one nurse. It did not look well. He would hire two others to do the drudgery and leave her as Mammy-inchief. This Mammy understood very well. More servants were a credit to her position as well as Rhett's. But she would not, she told him firmly, have any trashy free issue niggers in her nursery. So Rhett sent to Tara for Prissy. He knew her shortcomings but, after all, she was a family darky. And Uncle Peter produced a great-niece named Lou who had belonged to one of Miss Pitty's Burr cousins.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="来来去去的这些女仆，嬷嬷都喜欢，因为她忌妒任何新来的黑人，她还认为没有理由说她不能照顾这个孩子，同时也照顾韦德和爱拉。但是嬷嬷年纪大了，这是明摆着的事，而且她的风湿病了使得她那摇摇晃晃的步子更加迟缓。瑞德没有勇气举出这些理由来另外雇人，却对嬷嬷说，像他这种地位的人不能只雇一个女仆，这样不体面。还要雇两个人干重活，让她当头儿。嬷嬷对这一点十分理解。再来几个佣人，不仅为瑞德增加光彩，也为她增加光彩。但是她对瑞德说，决不能让那些不能干的黑人来照顾孩子。于是瑞德就派人到塔拉去接普里茜。他知道她的弱点。但她毕竟是个家奴。此外，彼得大叔说他有了个侄孙女，名叫卢儿，是属于皮蒂姑妈一个姓伯尔的表亲的。">查看中文翻译</div>
