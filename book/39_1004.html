"So everyone is scared to get in the water, and suddenly you kick off your shoes, Amir agha, and take off your shirt. 'There's no monster,' you say. 'I'll show you all.' And before anyone can stop you, you dive into the water, start swimming away. I follow you in and we're both swimming."</div>

<div class="line_en">The next morning, as he brewed black tea for breakfast, Hassan told me he'd had a dream. "We were at Ghargha Lake, you, me, Father, Agha sahib, Rahim Khan, and thousands of other people," he said. "It was warm and sunny, and the lake was clear like a mirror. But no one was swimming because they said a monster had come to the lake. It was swimming at the bottom, waiting."</div>

<div class="line_en">Hassan laughed. "It's a dream, Amir agha, you can do anything. Anyway, everyone is screaming, 'Get out! Get out!' but we just swim in the cold water. We make it way out to the middle of the lake and we stop swimming. We turn toward the shore and wave to the people. They look small like ants, but we can hear them clapping. They see now. There is no monster, just water. They change the name of the lake after that, and call it the 'Lake of Amir and Hassan, Sultans of Kabul,' and we get to charge people money for swimming in it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈桑哈哈大笑：“那是在梦里啊，阿米尔少爷，你能做任何事情。每个人都尖声叫唤：‘快起来！快起来！‘但我们只是在冰冷的湖水里面游泳。我们游到湖中央，停下来。我们转向湖岸，朝人们挥手。他们看起来像小小的蚂蚁，但我们能听到他们的掌声。现在他们知道了，湖里没有鬼怪，只有湖水。随后他们给湖改了名字，管它叫‘喀布尔的苏丹阿米尔和哈桑之湖‘。我们向那些到湖里游泳的人收钱。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">THE STREETS GLISTENED with fresh snow and the sky was a blameless blue. Snow blanketed every rooftop and weighed on the branches of the stunted mulberry trees that lined our street. Overnight, snow had nudged its way into every crack and gutter. I squinted against the blinding white when Hassan and I stepped through the wrought-iron gates. Ali shut the gates behind us. I heard him mutter a prayer under his breath -- he always said a prayer when his son left the house.</div>

<div class="line_en">I had never seen so many people on our street. Kids were flinging snowballs, squabbling, chasing one another, giggling. Kite fighters were huddling with their spool holders, making last minute preparations. From adjacent streets, I could hear laughter and chatter. Already, rooftops were jammed with spectators reclining in lawn chairs, hot tea steaming from thermoses, and the music of Ahmad Zahir blaring from cassette players. The immensely popular Ahmad Zahir had revolutionized Afghan music and outraged the purists by adding electric guitars, drums, and horns to the traditional tabla and harmonium; on stage or at parties, he shirked the austere and nearly morose stance of older singers and actually smiled when he sang -- sometimes even at women. I turned my gaze to our rooftop, found Baba and Rahim Khan sitting on a bench, both dressed in wool sweaters, sipping tea. Baba waved. I couldn't tell if he was waving at me or Hassan.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我从来没有见到街上有这么多人。儿童在打雪仗，拌嘴，相互追逐，咯咯笑着。风筝斗士和帮他们拿卷轴的人挤在一起，做最后的准备。周围的街道传来欢声笑语，各处屋顶已经挤满了看客，他们斜躺在折叠椅上，暖水壶里的红茶热气腾腾，录音机传出艾哈迈德·查希尔（Ahmad Zahir 1946～1979，阿富汗歌星）喧闹的音乐。风靡全国的艾哈迈德·查希尔改进了阿富汗音乐，给传统的手鼓和手风琴配上电吉他、小号和鼓，激怒了那些保守的教徒。无论在台上表演还是开派对，他都跟以前那些呆板的歌手不同，他拒绝木无表情的演出，而是边唱边微笑——有时甚至对女人微笑。我朝自家的屋顶看去，发现爸爸和拉辛汗坐在一张长凳上，两人都穿着羊毛衫，喝着茶。爸爸挥挥手，我不知道他究竟是跟我还是跟哈桑打招呼。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"We should get started," Hassan said. He wore black rubber snow boots and a bright green chapan over a thick sweater and faded corduroy pants. Sunlight washed over his face, and, in it, I saw how well the pink scar above his lip had healed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们得开始了。”哈桑说。他穿着一双黑色的橡胶雪靴，厚厚的羊毛衫和褪色的灯芯绒裤外面，罩着绿色的长袍。阳光照在他脸上，我看到他唇上那道粉红色的伤痕已经弥合得很好了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then he stepped toward me and, in a low voice, said something that scared me a little. "Remember, Amir agha. There's no monster, just a beautiful day." How could I be such an open book to him when, half the time, I had no idea what was milling around in his head? I was the one who went to school, the one who could read, write. I was the smart one. Hassan couldn't read a first grade textbook but he'd read me plenty. That was a little unsettling, but also sort of comfortable to have someone who always knew what you needed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着他上前一步，低声说了一句让我有些吃惊的话。“记住，阿米尔少爷，没有鬼怪，只是个好日子。”我对他脑海盘桓的念头常常一无所知，可是我在他面前怎么就像一本打开的书？到学校上学的人是我，会读书写字的人是我，聪明伶俐的也是我。哈桑虽然看不懂一年级的课本，却能看穿我。这让人不安，可是有人永远对你的需求了如指掌，毕竟也叫人宽心。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It occurred to me then that maybe Hassan had made up his dream. Was that possible? I decided it wasn't. Hassan wasn't that smart. I wasn't that smart. But made up or not, the silly dream had lifted some of my anxiety. Maybe I should take off my shirt, take a swim in the lake. Why not?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当时我觉得哈桑那个梦可能是他编出来的。那可能吗？我确定不是，哈桑没那么聪明，我也没那么聪明。但不管是否是编造的，那个愚蠢的梦缓解了我的焦虑。兴许我该除去衣服，到湖里去游一游。为什么不呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Hassan's face brightened. "Good," he said. He lifted our kite, red with yellow borders, and, just beneath where the central and cross spars met, marked with Saifo's unmistakable signature. He licked his finger and held it up, tested the wind, then ran in its direction-on those rare occasions we flew kites in the summer, he'd kick up dust to see which way the wind blew it. The spool rolled in my hands until Hassan stopped, about fifty feet away. He held the kite high over his head, like an Olympic athlete showing his gold medal. I jerked the string twice, our usual signal, and Hassan tossed the kite.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈桑神色一振：“好啊！”他举起我们的风筝：红色的风筝，镶着黄边，在竖轴和横轴交叉的地方，有塞弗的亲笔签名。他舔舔手指，把它举起，测试风向，然后顺风跑去。我们偶尔也在夏天放风筝，他会踢起灰尘，看风吹向什么方位。我手里的卷轴转动着，直到哈桑停下来，大约在五十英尺开外。他将风筝高举过顶，仿佛一个奥运会的田径运动员高举获得的金牌。按照我们往常的信号，我猛拉两次线，哈桑放开了风筝。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At least two dozen kites already hung in the sky, like paper sharks roaming for prey. Within an hour, the number doubled, and red, blue, and yellow kites glided and spun in the sky. A cold breeze wafted through my hair. The wind was perfect for kite flying, blowing just hard enough to give some lift, make the sweeps easier. Next to me, Hassan held the spool, his hands already bloodied by the string.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="空中已经挂着至少二十来只风筝，如同纸制的鲨鱼，巡游搜猎食物。不到一个钟头，这个数字翻了一番，红色的、蓝色的、黄色的风筝在苍穹来回飞舞，熠熠生辉。寒冷的微风吹过我的头发。这风正适宜放风筝，风速不大，恰好能让风筝飘浮起来，也便于操控。哈桑在我身旁，帮忙拿着卷轴，手掌已被线割得鲜血淋漓。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Soon, the cutting started and the first of the defeated kites whirled out of control. They fell from the sky like shooting stars with brilliant, rippling tails, showering the neighborhoods below with prizes for the kite runners. I could hear the runners now, hollering as they ran the streets. Someone shouted reports of a fight breaking out two streets down.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="顷刻间，割线开始了，第一批被挫败的风筝断了线，回旋着跌落下来。它们像流星那样划过苍天，拖着闪亮的尾巴，散落在临近的街区，给追风筝的人带来奖赏。我能听得见那些追风筝的人，高声叫嚷，奔过大街小巷。有人扯开喉咙，报告说有两条街上爆发冲突了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Caught between Baba and the mullahs at school, I still hadn't made up my mind about God. But when a Koran ayat I had learned in my diniyat class rose to my lips, I muttered it. I took a deep breath, exhaled, and pulled on the string. Within a minute, my kite was rocketing to the sky. It made a sound like a paper bird flapping its wings. Hassan clapped his hands, whistled, and ran back to me. I handed him the spool, holding on to the string, and he spun it quickly to roll the loose string back on.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽说爸爸和学校的老师诲我不倦，我终究无法对真主死心塌地。可是当时，从教义答问课程学到的某段《可兰经》涌上嘴边，我低声念诵，然后深深吸气，呼气，跟着拉线跑开。不消一分钟，我的风筝扶摇直上，发出宛如鸟儿扑打翅膀的声音。哈桑拍掌称好，跑在我身后。我把卷轴交给他，双手拉紧风筝线，他敏捷地将那松弛的线卷起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="我偷眼望向爸爸，看见他和拉辛汗坐在一起，寻思他眼下在想些什么。他在为我加油吗？还是希望我的失败给他带来愉悦？放风筝就是这样的，思绪随着风筝高低起伏。">查看中文翻译</div>

Was he surprised I had lasted as long as I had? You don't keep your eyes to the sky, you won't last much longer. I snapped my gaze back to the sky. A red kite was closing in on me -- I'd caught it just in time. I tangled a bit with it, ended up besting him when he became impatient and tried to cut me from below.</div>

<div class="line_en">Up and down the streets, kite runners were returning triumphantly, their captured kites held high. They showed them off to their parents, their friends. But they all knew the best was yet to come. The biggest prize of all was still flying. I sliced a bright yellow kite with a coiled white tail. It cost me another gash on the index finger and blood trickled down into my palm. I had Hassan hold the string and sucked the blood dry, blotted my finger against my jeans.</div>

If Baba was wrong and there was a God like they said in school, then He'd let me win. I didn't know what the other guy was playing for, maybe just bragging rights. But this was my one chance to become someone who was looked at, not seen, listened to, not heard. If there was a God, He'd guide the winds, let them blow for me so that, with a tug of my string, I'd cut loose my pain, my longing. I'd endured too much, come too far.

A few blocks away, from the Haji Yaghoub Mosque, the mullah bellowed azan, calling for the faithful to unroll their rugs and bow their heads west in prayer. Hassan never missed any of the five daily prayers. Even when we were out playing, he'd excuse himself, draw water from the well in the yard, wash up, and disappear into the hut.

<div class="line_en">"But today is your lucky day, Hazara," Assef said. He had his back to me, but I would have bet he was grinning. "I'm in a mood to forgive. What do you say to that, boys?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“但你今天很幸运，哈扎拉人。”阿塞夫说。他背朝我，但我敢打赌他脸上一定挂着邪恶的笑容。“我心情很好，可以原谅你。你们说呢，小子们？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That's generous," Kamal blurted, "Especially after the rude manners he showed us last time." He was trying to sound like Assef, except there was a tremor in his voice. Then I understand: He wasn't afraid of Hassan, not really. He was afraid because he had no idea what Assef had in mind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“太宽宏大量了，”卡莫喊道，“特别是考虑到他上次对我们那样粗鲁无礼。”他想学着阿塞夫的语调，可是声音里面有些颤抖。于是我明白了：他害怕的不是哈桑，绝对不是。他害怕，是因为不知道阿塞夫在打什么主意。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I realized I still hadn't breathed out. I exhaled, slowly, quietly. I felt paralyzed. I watched them close in on the boy I'd grown up with, the boy whose harelipped face had been my first memory.</div>

<div class="line_en">"A rupia each, children. Just one rupia each and I will part the curtain of truth." The old man sits against a mud wall. His sightless eyes are like molten silver embedded in deep, twin craters. Hunched over his cane, the fortune-teller runs a gnarled hand across the surface of his deflated cheeks. Cups it before us. "Not much to ask for the truth, is it, a rupia each?" Hassan drops a coin in the leathery palm. I drop mine too. "In the name of Allah most beneficent, most merciful," the old fortune-teller whispers. He takes Hassan's hand first, strokes the palm with one hornlike fingernail, round and round, round and round. The finger then floats to Hassan's face and makes a dry, scratchy sound as it slowly traces the curve of his cheeks, the outline of his ears. The calloused pads of his fingers brush against Hassan's eyes. The hand stops there. Lingers. A shadow passes across the old man's face. Hassan and I exchange a glance. The old man takes Hassan's hand and puts the rupia back in Hassan's palm. He turns to me. "How about you, young friend?" he says. On the other side of the wall, a rooster crows. The old man reaches for my hand and I withdraw it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“每人一个卢比，孩子们。每人只要一个卢比，我就会替你们揭开命运的帷幕。”那个老人倚墙而坐，黯淡无光的双眼像滑溜溜的银子，镶嵌在一双深深的火山洞口中。算命先生弯腰拄着拐杖，从消瘦的脸颊下面伸出一只嶙峋的手，在我们面前做成杯状。“每人一个卢比就可知道命运，不贵吧？”哈桑放了个铜钿在他粗糙的手掌上，我也放了一个。“以最仁慈、最悲悯的安拉之名。”那位老算命先生低声说。他先是拿起哈桑的手，用一只兽角般的指甲，在他掌心转了又转，转了又转。跟着那根手指飘向哈桑的脸庞，慢慢摸索着哈桑脸颊的曲线、耳朵的轮廓，发出干燥的刮擦声。他的手指生满老茧，轻轻拂着哈桑的眼睑。手停在那儿，迟疑不去。老人脸上掠过一抹阴影，哈桑和我对望了一眼。老人抓起哈桑手，把那个卢比还给他。“让我看看你怎么样，小朋友？”他说。墙那边传来公鸡的叫声。老人伸手来拉我的手，我抽回来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A HAVOC OF SCRAP AND RUBBLE littered the alley. Worn bicycle tires, bottles with peeled labels, ripped up magazines, yellowed newspapers, all scattered amid a pile of bricks and slabs of cement. A rusted cast-iron stove with a gaping hole on its side tilted against a wall. But there were two things amid the garbage that I couldn't stop looking at: One was the blue kite resting against the wall, close to the cast-iron stove; the other was Hassan's brown corduroy pants thrown on a heap of eroded bricks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="小巷堆满了破铜烂铁，废弃的自行车轮胎、标签剥落的玻璃瓶子、卷边的杂志、发黄的报纸，所有这些，散落在一堆砖头和水泥板间。墙边有个锈蚀的铁火炉，炉洞像血盆大口般张开。但在那些垃圾之间，有两件东西让我无法移开眼光：一件是蓝风筝，倚在墙边，紧邻铁炉；另一件是哈桑的棕色灯芯绒裤，丢在那堆碎砖块上面。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I am lost in a snowstorm. The wind shrieks, blows stinging sheets of snow into my eyes. I stagger through layers of shifting white. I call for help but the wind drowns my cries. I fall and lie panting on the snow, lost in the white, the wind wailing in my ears. I watch the snow erase my fresh footprints. I'm a ghost now, I think, a ghost with no footprints. I cry out again, hope fading like my footprints. But this time, a muffled reply. I shield my eyes and manage to sit up. Out of the swaying curtains of snow, I catch a glimpse of movement, a flurry of color. A familiar shape materializes. A hand reaches out for me. I see deep, parallel gashes across the palm, blood dripping, staining the snow. I take the hand and suddenly the snow is gone. We're standing in afield of apple green grass with soft wisps of clouds drifting above. I look up and see the clear sky is filled with kites, green, yellow, red, orange. They shimmer in the afternoon light.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我在暴风雪中迷失了方向。寒风凛冽，吹着雪花，刺痛了我的双眼。我在白雪皑皑中跋涉。我高声求救，但风淹没了我的哭喊。我颓然跌倒，躺在雪地上喘息，茫然望着一片白茫茫，寒风在我耳边呼啸，我看见雪花抹去我刚踩下的脚印。我现在是个鬼魂，我想，一个没有脚印的鬼魂。我又高声呼喊，但希望随着脚印消逝。这当头，有人闷声回应。我把手架在眼睛上，挣扎着坐起来。透过风雪飞舞的帘幕，我看见人影摇摆，颜色晃动。一个熟悉的身影出现了。一只手伸在我面前，我望见手掌上有深深的、平行的伤痕，鲜血淋漓，染红了雪地。我抓住那只手，瞬间雪停了。我们站在一片原野上，绿草如茵，天空中和风吹着白云。我抬眼望去，但见万里晴空，满是风筝在飞舞，绿的、黄的、红的、橙的。它们在午后的阳光中闪耀着光芒。">查看中文翻译</div>

Assef was standing over them, the heel of his snow boots crushing the back of Hassan's neck.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不知道，”瓦里说，“我爸爸说那是犯罪。”他的声音自始至终充满了怀疑、兴奋、害怕。哈桑趴在地上。卡莫和瓦里一人抓住他一只手，将其从手肘扭转，压在哈桑背后。阿塞夫站在他们上方，用雪靴的后跟踩着哈桑的脖子后面。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Assef knelt behind Hassan, put his hands on Hassan's hips and lifted his bare buttocks. He kept one hand on Hassan's back and undid his own belt buckle with his free hand. He unzipped his jeans. Dropped his underwear. He positioned himself behind Hassan. Hassan didn't struggle. Didn't even whimper. He moved his head slightly and I caught a glimpse of his face. Saw the resignation in it. It was a look I had seen before. It was the look of the lamb.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿塞夫在哈桑身后跪倒，双手放在哈桑的臀部，把他光光的屁股抬起。他一手伸在哈桑背上，另外一只手去解开自己的皮带。他脱下牛仔裤，脱掉内裤。他在哈桑身后摆好位置。哈桑没有反抗，甚至没有呻吟。他稍稍转过头，我瞥见他的脸庞，那逆来顺受的神情。之前我也见过这种神色，这种羔羊的神色。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">About fifteen minutes later, I heard voices and running footfalls. I crouched behind the cubicle and watched Assef and the other two sprinting by, laughing as they hurried down the deserted lane. I forced myself to wait ten more minutes. Then I walked back to the rutted track that ran along the snow-filled ravine. I squinted in the dimming light and spotted Hassan walking slowly toward me. I met him by a leafless birch tree on the edge of the ravine.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="约莫隔了十五分钟，我听到人声，还有脚步声。我躲在那家小店，望着阿塞夫和那两个人走过，笑声飘过空荡荡的过道。我强迫自己再等十分钟。然后我走回到那条和冰封的小溪平行、满是车痕的小巷。我在昏暗的光芒中眯起眼睛，看见哈桑慢慢朝我走来。在河边一棵光秃秃的桦树下，我和他相遇。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I ran because I was a coward. I was afraid of Assef and what he would do to me. I was afraid of getting hurt. That's what I told myself as I turned my back to the alley, to Hassan. That's what I made myself believe. I actually aspired to cowardice, because the alternative, the real reason I was running, was that Assef was right: Nothing was free in this world. Maybe Hassan was the price I had to pay, the lamb I had to slay, to win Baba. Was it a fair price? The answer floated to my conscious mind before I could thwart it: He was just a Hazara, wasn't he?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我逃跑，因为我是懦夫。我害怕阿塞夫，害怕他折磨我。我害怕受到伤害。我转身离开小巷、离开哈桑的时候，心里这样对自己说。我试图让自己这么认为。说真的，我宁愿相信自己是出于软弱，因为另外的答案，我逃跑的真正原因，是觉得阿塞夫说得对：这个世界没有什么是免费的。为了赢回爸爸，也许哈桑只是必须付出的代价，是我必须宰割的羔羊。这是个公平的代价吗？我还来不及抑止，答案就从意识中冒出来：他只是个哈扎拉人，不是吗？">查看中文翻译</div>

I was grateful for the early-evening shadows that fell on Hassan's face and concealed mine. I was glad I didn't have to return his gaze. Did he know I knew? And if he knew, then what would I see if I did look in his eyes? Blame? Indignation? Or, God forbid, what I feared most: guileless devotion? That, most of all, I couldn't bear to see.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈桑伸手用衣袖擦擦脸，抹去眼泪和鼻涕。我等待他开口，但我们只是静静地站在那儿，在消逝的天光中。我很感谢夜幕降临，遮住了哈桑的脸，也掩盖了我的面庞。我很高兴我不用看着他的眼睛。他知道我知道吗？如果他知道，我能从他眼里看到什么呢？埋怨？耻辱？或者，愿真主制止，我最怕看到的：真诚的奉献。所有这些里，那是我最不愿看到的。">查看中文翻译</div>
