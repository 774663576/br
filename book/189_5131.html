<div class="line_en">Such changes appear absurd; but they are not so unnatural as they would seem at first sight. The transitions in real life from well-spread boards to death-beds, and from mourning-weeds to holiday garments, are not a whit less startling; only, there, we are busy actors, instead of passive lookers-on, which makes a vast difference. The actors in the mimic life of the theatre, are blind to violent transitions and abrupt impulses of passion or feeling, which, presented before the eyes of mere spectators, are at once condemned as outrageous and preposterous.</div>

<div class="line_en">It is the custom on the stage, in all good murderous melodramas, to present the tragic and the comic scenes, in as regular alternation, as the layers of red and white in a side of streaky bacon. The hero sinks upon his straw bed, weighed down by fetters and misfortunes; in the next scene, his faithful but unconscious squire regales the audience with a comic song. We behold, with throbbing bosoms, the heroine in the grasp of a proud and ruthless baron: her virtue and her life alike in danger, drawing forth her dagger to preserve the one at the cost of the other; and just as our expectations are wrought up to the highest pitch, a whistle is heard, and we are straightway transported to the great hall of the castle; where a grey-headed seneschal sings a funny chorus with a funnier body of vassals, who are free of all sorts of places, from church vaults to palaces, and roam about in company, carolling perpetually.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在一切优秀的凶杀剧目中，总是交替出现悲哀的和滑稽的场面，就跟一段段肥瘦相间，熏制得法的五花肉一样，这已经成为舞台上的一种惯例了。男主人公为镣铐与不幸所累，栽倒在柴草褥子上。接下来的一场，他那位不开窍的忠实随从却用一首滑稽小调来逗观众开心。我们揣着一颗卜卜跳动的心，看到女主人公落入一位傲慢粗鲁的男爵的怀抱，她的贞操和性命都发发可危。她拔出匕首，准备以牺牲性命的代价来保全贞操。正当我们的暇想被上调到最高限度的当儿，只听一声号角，我们又径直被转移到城堡的大厅里，在那个地方，一个白发总管正领唱一支滑稽可笑的歌曲，参与合唱的是一群更加滑稽可笑的家奴，他们从各种各样的地方跑出来，从教堂的拱顶到宫殿城阙，正结伴邀游四方，永无休止地欢唱。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As sudden shiftings of the scene, and rapid changes of time and place, are not only sanctioned in books by long usage, but are by many considered as the great art of authorship: an author's skill in his craft being, by such critics, chiefly estimated with relation to the dilemmas in which he leaves his characters at the end of every chapter: this brief introduction to the present one may perhaps be deemed unnecessary. If so, let it be considered a delicate intimation on the part of the historian that he is going back to the town in which Oliver Twist was born; the reader taking it for granted that there are good and substantial reasons for making the journey, or he would not be invited to proceed upon such an expedition.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="鉴于场景的急转直下，时间、地点的迅速变换，长期以来不仅在书本中沿用，有许多人还认为这属于大手笔――这一类评论家衡量作者的高下，主要是依据他在每章末尾处将人物置于怎样的困境之中――读者也许认为这一段简短的导言是不必要的。如果是这样，就请把这段话当作是本书作者的一个微妙的暗示吧，作者要照直回到奥立弗退斯特诞生的那座小城去了，读者都应当考虑到，这一趟远行是有充分而紧迫的理由的，否则无论如何也不会邀请他们作这样一次远行。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mr. Bumble emerged at early morning from the workhouse-gate, and walked with portly carriage and commanding steps, up the High Street. He was in the full bloom and pride of beadlehood; his cocked hat and coat were dazzling in the morning sun; he clutched his cane with the vigorous tenacity of health and power. Mr. Bumble always carried his head high; but this morning it was higher than usual. There was an abstraction in his eye, an elevation in his air, which might have warned an observant stranger that thoughts were passing in the beadle's mind, too great for utterance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这天一大早，邦布尔先生就走出了济贫院大门口。他一副气宇不凡的派头，步履生风地走上大街。他神采飞扬，充满教区干事的自豪感：三角帽和大衣在朝阳下闪着耀眼的光芒，他紧握手杖，精神饱满，浑身是劲。邦布尔先生的头向来就抬得很高，今天早上比平时抬得还要高。他目光有些出神，表情愉悦，这副神气兴许已经向细心的的陌生人发出了警告，这位干事心目中匆匆来去的念头真有说不出的伟大。">查看中文翻译</div>

That he had terminated his brief career in the place of his birth, by making a sanguinary and cowardly attack on an unoffending lad, and running away in the night-time from his master's house.
