<div class="line_en">He rode to the top with Lord Mormont and the officers, leaving Ghost below under the trees. The direwolf had run off three times as they climbed, twice returning reluctantly to Jon's whistle. The third time, the Lord Commander lost patience and snapped, "Let him go, boy. I want to reach the crest before dusk. Find the wolf later."</div>

<div class="line_en">The way up was steep and stony, the summit crowned by a chest-high wall of tumbled rocks. They had to circle some distance west before they found a gap large enough to admit the horses. "This is good ground, Thoren," the Old Bear proclaimed when at last they attained the top. "We could scarce hope for better. We'll make our camp here to await Halfhand." The Lord Commander swung down off his saddle, dislodging the raven from his shoulder. Complaining loudly, the bird took to the air.</div>

<div class="line_en">The views atop the hill were bracing, yet it was the ringwall that drew Jon's eye, the weathered grey stones with their white patches of lichen, their beards of green moss. It was said that the Fist had been a ringfort of the First Men in the Dawn Age. "An old place, and strong," Thoren Smallwood said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山顶的风光很不错，但真正吸引琼恩的是那道环墙：风化的灰石上爬满片片苍白的地衣，绿色的苔藓轻轻拂动。传说这座拳峰是黎明纪元里先民所修筑的环堡。“地方虽古老，但依然坚固，”索伦·斯莫伍德说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When Lord Mormont said, "We're not like to find another place as strong. We'll carry water, and make certain we are well supplied," Jon knew better than to argue. So the command was given, and the brothers of the Night's Watch raised their camp behind the stone ring the First Men had made. Black tents sprouted like mushrooms after a rain, and blankets and bedrolls covered the bare ground. Stewards tethered the garrons in long lines, and saw them fed and watered. Foresters took their axes to the trees in the waning afternoon light to harvest enough wood to see them through the night. A score of builders set to clearing brush, digging latrines, and untying their bundles of fire-hardened stakes. "I will have every opening in the ringwall ditched and staked before dark," the Old Bear had commanded.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莫尔蒙司令也接口道：“看样子，我们找不到比这更坚固的地方了。我们可以把水先挑上来，确保补给充足。”琼恩知道多说无益，便不再开口。于是命令就此下达，守夜人的弟兄们很快在先民修筑的石墙后搭起了帐篷。黑色的营帐如雨后蘑菇般纷纷浮现，毯子和铺盖卷罩住了光秃的土地。事务官们将驮马排成长长的队列，喂它们草料和清水。林务官们则乘着落日的余晖拿起斧子到树林里砍伐木材，以备夜晚之需。一群工匠着手清理地面，挖掘厕所，并解下捆捆用火淬硬的木桩。“天黑之前，务必把环墙每个开口都挖好壕沟，立起桩子，”熊老下令。">查看中文翻译</div>

One moment Jon was striding beneath the trees, whistling and shouting, alone in the green, pinecones and fallen leaves under his feet; the next, the great white direwolf was walking beside him, pale as morning mist.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="等司令官的营帐搭好，将马匹安顿完毕，琼恩便下山去寻找白灵。冰原狼立刻响应他的召唤，沉默地冲出来：前一刻琼恩还孤身一人，大步走在林间，踏着松果和落叶，边吹口哨边喊叫；下一刻，这头大白狼就已经漫步在他身边，苍白一如晨雾。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Stop acting the boy," he told himself. Clambering atop the piled rocks, Jon gazed off toward the setting sun. He could see the light shimmering like hammered gold off the surface of the Milkwater as it curved away to the south. Upriver the land was more rugged, the dense forest giving way to a series of bare stony hills that rose high and wild to the north and west. On the horizon stood the mountains like a great shadow, range on range of them receding into the blue-grey distance, their jagged peaks sheathed eternally in snow. Even from afar they looked vast and cold and inhospitable.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“行了，别孩子气了，”他对自己说。爬上堆叠的乱石，琼恩望向落暮的太阳。乳河蜿蜒着流向南方，河面上闪烁的微光，好似锻冶中的黄金。上游的土地更加崎岖，浓密的森林不复出现，取而代之的是一系列光秃的石丘，它们肆无忌惮地高高耸立，并向着北方和西方延伸。远方的地平线上，山脉好似雄浑的阴影，一片接一片，直至变得灰白模糊。参差的峰峦上终年积雪，纵然遥遥相望，它们依旧那么庞大、冰冷、寂寞而荒凉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They ought to be safe here. The hill offered commanding views, and the slopes were precipitous to the north and west and only slightly more gentle to the east. Yet as the dusk deepened and darkness seeped into the hollows between the trees, Jon's sense of foreboding grew. This is the haunted forest, he told himself. Maybe there are ghosts here, the spirits of the First Men. This was their place, once.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="墙里面应该很安全。居高临下，附近地区都在视野之中，而山坡在北、西两面都非常陡峭，惟在东方稍微舒缓。虽然如此，但随着暮色渐沉，黑暗逐步渗透到林间的空旷中，琼恩心里的惴惴不安却油然而生。这可是鬼影森林啊，他告诉自己，这里或许真的有鬼魂，先民的幽灵在此徘徊不去呢。毕竟这里曾是他们的地盘。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But when they reached the ringfort, Ghost balked again. He padded forward warily to sniff at the gap in the stones, and then retreated, as if he did not like what he'd smelled. Jon tried to grab him by the scruff of his neck and haul him bodily inside the ring, no easy task; the wolf weighed as much as he did, and was stronger by far. "Ghost, what's wrong with you?" It was not like him to be so unsettled. In the end Jon had to give it up. "As you will," he told the wolf. "Go, hunt." The red eyes watched him as he made his way back through the mossy stones.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可抵达环堡外围时，白灵却又不肯前进。他小心翼翼地跑上前去嗅嗅岩石的缝隙，接着便忙不迭地后退，好像很不喜欢嗅到的气息。琼恩抓住他颈背，打算硬拖他进入环墙，这并不容易——冰原狼几乎和他一般重，无疑还远比他强壮。“白灵，你是哪儿不对劲了？”他从来不会这么违拗啊。最后琼恩只好放弃。“随你便啦，”他告诉狼，“去吧，打猎去吧。”他穿过青苔密布的石墙往回走，那双红色的眼睛一直盯着他。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ghost was not like to be alone down there, he thought. Anything could be moving under that sea, creeping toward the ringfort through the dark of the wood, concealed beneath those trees. Anything. How would they ever know? He stood there for a long time, until the sun vanished behind the saw-toothed mountains and darkness began to creep through the forest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="白灵怎会喜欢独自待在这种地方？他心想。在这片林海汪洋里，任何移动的事物，即便正朝着环堡扑来，也根本无从窥见。任何事物。真有什么不测我们该怎样防备？他在原地伫立许久，直到太阳消失在锯齿状的山脉后，暗影爬进了森林。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Closer at hand, it was the trees that ruled. To south and east the wood went on as far as Jon could see, a vast tangle of root and limb painted in a thousand shades of green, with here and there a patch of red where a weirwood shouldered through the pines and sentinels, or a blush of yellow where some broadleafs had begun to turn. When the wind blew, he could hear the creak and groan of branches older than he was. A thousand leaves fluttered, and for a moment the forest seemed a deep green sea, storm-tossed and heaving, eternal and unknowable.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="拉近视线，四周完完全全是树的天下。南面和东面，林木直到视野尽头，这是一片无比辽阔、盘根错节的密林，撒下成千上万暗绿的影子，其中点缀着几处红色，那是挤开松树或哨兵树的鱼梁木，偶而浮现的黄则是几株开始成熟的阔叶烟草。朔风吹起，他听见远比他年迈的枝叶在呻吟叹息。千百片树叶集体舞蹈，一时之间，森林似乎化为深绿的海洋，风暴流转，不得宁息，恒同日月，难以揣测。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes, my lord." Jon built a cookfire, claimed a small cask of Mormont's favorite robust red from stores, and poured it into a kettle. He hung the kettle above the flames while he gathered the rest of his ingredients. The Old Bear was particular about his hot spiced wine. So much cinnamon and so much nutmeg and so much honey, not a drop more. Raisins and nuts and dried berries, but no lemon, that was the rankest sort of southron heresy -- which was queer, since he always took lemon in his morning beer. The drink must be hot to warm a man properly, the Lord Commander insisted, but the wine must never be allowed to come to a boil. Jon kept a careful eye on the kettle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是，大人。”于是琼恩升起篝火，找负责给养的人要了一小桶莫尔蒙最喜欢的红葡萄酒，并将之倒进壶中。随后他将水壶搁在火上，自己跑去取其他材料。熊老对他爱喝的香料热酒是很讲究的：添加的肉桂、豆蔻和蜂蜜都有特定的剂量，不多也不少，此外还要加入葡萄干、坚果和干浆果，但不放柠檬——因为那是来自遥远南方的奢侈品，非常稀罕，熊老只用它来搭配早餐的啤酒。“饮料的第一功用是温暖身体，”司令官如此强调，“但葡萄酒不能煮沸了”。于是琼恩小心翼翼地盯着水壶。">查看中文翻译</div>

A torch had been thrust down into a crevice, its flames flying pale orange banners when the gusts came. He snatched it up as he squeezed through the gap between the stones. Ghost went racing down the hill. Jon followed more slowly, the torch thrust out before him as he made his descent. The camp sounds faded behind him.

Branches clutched at his cloak, while overhead thick limbs twined together and shut out the stars.</div>

Every few feet he called again for Ghost, but the night wind was swirling amongst the trees and it drank the words. This is madness, he thought as he plunged deeper into the trees.

<div class="line_en">A length of frayed rope bound the bundle together. Jon unsheathed his dagger and cut it, groped for the edges of the cloth, and pulled. The bundle turned, and its contents spilled out onto the ground, glittering dark and bright. He saw a dozen knives, leaf-shaped spearheads, numerous arrowheads. Jon picked up a dagger blade, featherlight and shiny black, hiltless. Torchlight ran along its edge, a thin orange line that spoke of razor sharpness. Dragonglass. What the maesters call obsidian.

<div class="line_en">Beneath the dragonglass was an old warhorn, made from an auroch's horn and banded in bronze. Jon shook the dirt from inside it, and a stream of arrowheads fell out. He let them fall, and pulled up a corner of the cloth the weapons had been wrapped in, rubbing it between his fingers. Good wool, thick, a double weave, damp but not rotted. It could not have been long in the ground. And it was dark. He seized a handful and pulled it close to the torch. Not dark. Black.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="龙晶之下还有一个年代久远的号角，牛角制成，边缘镶了青铜。琼恩拍去号角里里外外的尘土，一串箭头也跟着滑落。他任它们落下，随手扯起包裹的一角，用手指揉搓。这是上好的羊毛，厚实，双层织工，虽然受了潮但并未腐朽。它埋藏的时间不可能太久。手边昏黑一团，琼恩牵起毛料，凑近火炬。不是昏黑，是漆黑。">查看中文翻译</div>
