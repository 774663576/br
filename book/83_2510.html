<div class="line_en">There was a small ivory pushbutton beside the door marked "405." I pushed it and waited what seemed a long time. Then the door opened noiselessly about a foot. There was a steady, furtive air in the way it opened. The man was long-legged, long-waisted, high-shouldered and he had dark brown eyes in a brown expressionless face that had learned to control its expressions long ago. Hair like steel wool grew far back on his head and gave him a great deal of domed brown forehead that might at a careless glance have seemed a dwelling place for brains. His somber eyes probed at me impersonally. His long thin brown fingers held the edge of the door. He said nothing.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was ten minutes to five when I parked near the lobby entrance of the apartment house on Randall Place. A few windows were lit and radios were bleating at the dusk. I rode the automatic elevator up to the fourth floor and went along a wide hall carpeted in green and paneled in ivory. A cool breeze blew down the hall from the open screened door to the fire escape.</div>

<div class="line_en">Nothing in the man's face changed that I could see. He brought a cigarette from behind the door and tucked it between his lips and drew a little smoke from it. The smoke came towards me in a lazy, contemptuous puff and behind it words in a cool, unhurried voice that had no more inflection than the voice of a faro dealer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="看不到他脸上有任何波动。他从门背后拿出一根烟，塞进嘴里，吸了一小口。一阵阵既慵懒又轻蔑的烟扑面而来，接着一个冷漠从容的声音开口了，平板得像是法罗牌玩家发牌时的语气。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">That left the east wall, in which there were no doors. There was a davenport backed against the middle of it, so I sat down on the davenport. Brody shut the door and walked crab-fashion to a tall oak desk studded with square nails. A cedarwood box with gilt hinges lay on the lowered leaf of the desk. He carried the box to an easy chair midway between the other two doors and sat down. I dropped my hat on the davenport and waited.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后我看了看东墙，墙上没装门。背靠墙面中间放着一只长沙发，我坐了上去。布罗迪关好门，向一张饰有方形钉子的橡木书桌蟹行而去。书桌的下层面板上搁着一只镀金铰链的杉木盒子。他拿着盒子走到西墙的两扇门中间的安乐椅前，坐了下来。我把帽子放在长沙发上，等他开口。">查看中文翻译</div>

Near the windows a closed door in the west wall and near the entrance door another door in the same wall. This last had a plush curtain drawn across it on a thin brass rod below the lintel.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“行，我在听了。”布罗迪说。他打开雪茄盒，把手上的烟蒂扔进身旁的垃圾桶。他往嘴里塞进一根细长的雪茄。“来根雪茄？”他拿起一根，在半空中朝我挥了挥。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Neat, huh?" Brody said. "Just kind of stand up a minute. Come forward just about two yards. You might grab a little air while you're doing that." His voice was the elaborately casual voice of the tough guy in pictures. Pictures have made them all like that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“干脆利落吧？”布罗迪说，“给我起来站一会儿。再往前走两步。趁这个时候，你可以抓紧呼吸呼吸。”他的声音是电影里硬汉的那种嗓音，带着刻意为之的冷淡。电影让他们都成了那个样子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"The sucker list I spoke of is in code. I haven't cracked it yet, but there are about five hundred names. You got twelve boxes of books that I know of. You should have at least five hundred books. There'll be a bunch more out on loan, but say five hundred is the full crop, just to be cautious. If it's a good active list and you could run it even fifty per cent down the line, that would be one hundred and twenty-five thousand rentals. Your girl friend knows all about that. I'm only guessing. Put the average rental as low as you like, but it won't be less than a dollar. That merchandise costs money. At a dollar a rental you take one hundred and twenty-five grand and you still have your capital. I mean, you still have Geiger's capital. That's enough to spot a guy for."</div>

<div class="line_en">He exploded then. "That goddamned little hot pants!" he yelled. "She would, god damn her! She would -- just that!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这下他抓狂了。“那个天杀的小骚货！”他大叫，“她会的，这天杀的！她会的——就是那样！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I leaned back and grinned at him. "Swell. I thought you had those nude photos of her."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我往后一靠，朝他咧嘴笑笑。“好极了。我还以为她那些裸照在你手里呢。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He didn't say anything. The blonde didn't say anything. I let them chew on it. Brody's face cleared slowly, with a sort of grayish relief. He put his Colt down on the end table beside his chair but kept his right hand close to it. He knocked ash from his cigar on the carpet and stared at me with eyes that were a tight shine between narrowed lids.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他一言不发。那小妞也一言不发。我给他们思考的时间。布罗迪的脸上渐渐云开雾散了，虽然脸色还有点灰。他把枪搁在椅子旁的桌上，右手却依然紧靠枪托。他把烟灰点落在地毯上，眼皮眯成一条线，明亮的眸子注视着我。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“大概你觉得我是傻瓜。”布罗迪说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'd have to have a little dough," Brody said. He turned his head a little to look at the green-eyed blonde. Not now green-eyed and only superficially a blonde. She was as limp as a fresh-killed rabbit.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不让我赚点油水是不行的。”布罗迪说。他微微转过头，看着那个绿眼睛的金发妞。现在她那双眼睛都不绿了，只剩下一头徒有其表的金发。她没精打采得像只刚死的兔子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What pictures?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“什么照片？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I shook my head. "Wrong play, Joe. Innocence gets you nowhere. You were either there last night, or you got the nude photo from somebody that was there. You knew she was there, because you had your girl friend threaten Mrs. Regan with a police rap. The only ways you could know enough to do that would be by seeing what happened or by holding the photo and knowing where and when it was taken. Cough up and be sensible."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我摇摇头。“昏招啊，乔。装无辜救不了你。要么昨晚你在那儿，要么你从某个去了一遭的人那里搞到了裸照。你知道她在场，因为你让你女朋友威胁里根太太说要叫她吃官司。你之所以有把握这么做，若非亲眼目睹发生了什么，便是知道手里的照片是何时何地拍的。还是老实交代吧，聪明点儿。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No dough," I said.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他苦恼地皱着眉。“那你凭什么要我交代？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I flicked my wallet out and let him look at my buzzer. "I was working on Geiger -- for a client. I was outside last night, in the rain. I heard the shots. I crashed in. I didn't see the killer. I saw everything else."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="布罗迪叹了口气。“她恨透了我。我甩了她。没错，我得到了报酬，但不管怎样我还是只好那么做。对我这么个普通人来说，她太古怪了。”他清了清嗓子，“稍微来点油水吧。我穷得叮当响了。我和艾格尼丝得过活啊。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“噢，见鬼，”他说，“你赢了。”他站起身，把手枪塞进侧边口袋里。他左手一抬，伸进外套。他的手握住了照片，厌恶得脸都歪了。这时候，门铃响了。而且响个不停。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"About these books," Brody said. "I don't get that."</div>
