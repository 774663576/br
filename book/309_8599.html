<div class="line_cn" title="当他十三岁时，他的舅舅也死了，苦难再次降临。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As percentages would suggest, his uncle was not a hothead like Max. He was the type of person who worked quietly away for very little reward. He kept to himself and sacrificed everything for his family -- and he died of something growing in his stomach. Something akin to a poison bowling ball.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="异类不会频繁出现，舅舅不像马克斯那样鲁莽。他是那种默默工作，只为换取微薄报酬的人。他并不富有，不爱与人往来，把一切都奉献给了家庭。他的死因是胃里长了个东西，像保龄球那么大。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Somehow, between the sadness and loss, Max Vandenburg, who was now a teenager with hard hands, blackened eyes, and a sore tooth, was also a little disappointed. Even disgruntled. As he watched his uncle sink slowly into the bed, he decided that he would never allow himself to die like that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，马克斯·范登堡却在悲伤和丧恸之间生出些许失望之情，他甚至有些恼火。现在的他已经是个小伙子了，有一对坚硬的拳头、一双被人打得瘀青的眼睛和一颗疼痛的牙齿。亲眼看着舅舅在床上逐渐失去活力，他下定决心，自己绝不能这样死去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">With the rest of them, he stood around the bed and watched the man die -- a safe merge, from life to death. The light in the window was gray and orange, the color of summer's skin, and his uncle appeared relieved when his breathing disappeared completely.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他和家人围在床边，看着这个男人死去，看着他平静地从生过渡到死。灰色和橘色的光透过窗户照射进来，那是夏天里皮肤的颜色。舅舅彻底停止呼吸时，犹如松了口气。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他很享受关系牢固的小圈子，也喜欢未知的事物。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">From that moment on, he started to fight with greater regularity. A group of die-hard friends and enemies would gather down at a small reserve on Steber Street, and they would fight in the dying light. Archetypal Germans, the odd Jew, the boys from the east. It didn't matter. There was nothing like a good fight to expel the teenage energy. Even the enemies were an inch away from friendship.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从那以后，他开始更频繁地练拳。他的死党和死对头会在斯蒂伯街的老地方碰头，然后在渐渐暗下去的天色中打上一架。典型的日耳曼人，古怪的犹太人，还有来自东方的男孩，都可以成为对手。什么都不如痛快地打上一架更能排解少年的血气。就连死对头，也差点儿就能成为朋友。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">His favorite fight, now that he looked back, was Fight Number Five against a tall, tough, rangy kid named Walter Kugler. They were fifteen. Walter had won all four of their previous encounters, but this time, Max could feel something different. There was new blood in him -- the blood of victory -- and it had the capability to both frighten and excite.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如今回首过去，他最喜欢其中一场比赛，那是和一个高大结实的孩子瓦尔特·库格勒的第五次较量。他们都是十五岁。之前，瓦尔特和他交手的四次都赢了，不过这一次，马克斯觉得情况和以往不一样了。他的身体里流淌着新的血液——胜利的血液，令他既害怕又兴奋。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was a feeling in the stomach that would be stirred around until he thought he could no longer tolerate it. The only remedy was to move forward and throw punches. Max was not the type of boy to die thinking about it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那是一种在胃里不断翻腾，直到再也无法忍耐的感受。唯一的解药就是踏步向前，挥拳出击。马克斯可不是那种只有想法没有行动的男孩。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As always, there was a tight circle crowded around them. There was grubby ground. There were smiles practically wrapped around the onlooking faces. Money was clutched in filthy fingers, and the calls and cries were filled with such vitality that there was nothing else but this.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="和往常一样，旁观者围成圆圈，将他们俩围在中间。地面肮脏不堪。旁观者的脸上洋溢着笑容，肮脏的手指缝里攥着钱，喝彩声和挑衅声都充满了活力，除此以外什么也听不见。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The two fighters were clenched with the intensity of the moment, their faces loaded up with expression, exaggerated with the stress of it. The wide-eyed concentration.</div>

<div class="line_en">After a minute or so of testing each other out, they began moving closer and taking more risks. It was a street fight after all, not an hour-long title fight. They didn't have all day.</div>

<div class="line_en">He was beaten down one more time before he changed tactics, luring Walter Kugler a little closer than he'd wanted to come. Once he was there, Max was able to apply a short, sharp jab to his face. It stuck. Exactly on the nose.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="又被击倒两次之后，他改变策略，引诱瓦尔特·库格勒靠近自己，进入自己的攻击范围。库格勒不小心中计，马克斯便用力朝他的脸挥出一记敏锐的短拳。这一拳正中目标，重重地打在对手的鼻子上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was a great roar when he was knocked down. Money was almost exchanged.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="尽管挨了不少重拳，但是他仍然向前进攻。鲜血染红了他的嘴唇，很快就在牙齿上凝结。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A small kid with soft tufts of hair, a beaten nose, and swampy eyes, Max was a good head shorter than his opposition. His fighting style was utterly graceless, all bent over, nudging forward, throwing fast punches at the face of Kugler. The other boy, clearly stronger and more skillful, remained upright, throwing jabs that constantly landed on Max's cheeks and chin.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="马克斯头发耷拉着，鼻青脸肿，双眼凹陷，比对手矮了不止一头。他打架的手段非常粗野，整个人趴下去往前顶，用快拳不停地攻击库格勒的脸。对手显然更强壮更有技巧，他身板挺直，左右开弓，不时击中马克斯的脸颊和下巴。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The custom after a fight was that the loser would raise the hand of the victor. When Kugler finally stood up, he walked sullenly to Max Vandenburg and lifted his arm into the air.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="按照惯例，打完架后，输的人要举起赢家的手。当库格勒终于站起来后，他闷闷不乐地走向马克斯·范登堡，将他的臂膀高高地举向天空。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Altogether, over the next few years, Max Vandenburg and Walter Kugler fought thirteen times. Walter was always seeking revenge for that first victory Max took from him, and Max was looking to emulate his moment of glory. In the end, the record stood at 10-3 for Walter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此后的几年里，马克斯·范登堡和瓦尔特·库格勒一共交手过十三次。自从第一次落败后，瓦尔特一直在找机会复仇，而马克斯也想重现自己的光荣时刻。最后的结果是瓦尔特十胜三负。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Kugler, suddenly blinded, shuffled back, and Max seized his chance. He followed him over to the right and jabbed him once more and opened him up with a punch that reached into his ribs. The right hand that ended him landed on his chin. Walter Kugler was on the ground, his blond hair peppered with dirt. His legs were parted in a V. Tears like crystal floated down his skin, despite the fact that he was not crying. The tears had been bashed out of him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="库格勒突然两眼一花，摇晃着后退，马克斯则抓住机会。他快步跟进，从右侧再次出拳，打得对手露出破绽，肋骨上挨了一拳。最后，一记命中下巴的右拳彻底击败了他。瓦尔特·库格勒躺在地上，金发上沾满灰尘，双腿呈V字形大大地张开。虽然他并没有哭，晶莹的眼泪却在脸上流淌。那眼泪纯粹是被打出来的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Jesus," Walter said one evening, when they met on the small corner where they used to fight. "That was a time, wasn't it? There was none of this around." He gave the star on Max's sleeve a backhanded slap. "We could never fight like that now."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有一天，他们在过去打架的街角碰面，瓦尔特说：“上帝啊，感觉都过去好久了，是不是？那个时候还没有这么多狂热的事情。”他略带讽刺地拍了拍马克斯袖子上的星星，“我们再也不会像过去那样打架了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They fought each other until 1933, when they were seventeen. Grudging respect turned to genuine friendship, and the urge to fight left them. Both held jobs until Max was sacked with the rest of the Jews at the Jedermann Engineering Factory in '35. That wasn't long after the Nuremberg Laws came in, forbidding Jews to have German citizenship and for Germans and Jews to intermarry.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们一直打到十七岁，那一年是一九三三年。夹杂着恨意的惺惺相惜转变成真挚的友谊，打架的冲动也已经离他们而去。两个人都开始上班，直到一九三五年，马克斯和其他犹太人都被耶德曼机械厂解雇了。《纽伦堡法案》不久前刚刚颁布，犹太人已经被悉数剥夺了德国公民的身份，他们也不能和日耳曼人通婚。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">If you're the type who's interested, yes, there were a few girls in those years. One named Tania, the other Hildi. Neither of them lasted.

By 1938, it was difficult to imagine that life could get any harder.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果你是个好奇的人，那么好吧，那些年马克斯也遇到过几个女孩。一个名叫塔妮娅，另一个叫希尔迪。但两段感情都不长久，这都是时代的错，一切都没有定数，压力也越来越大。马克斯得拼命找工作。他能给这些女孩子带来什么呢？到了一九三八年，犹太人已经想象不出日子还能糟糕到什么地步了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For the next two years, he remained in hiding, in an empty storeroom. It was in a building where Walter had worked in previous years. There was very little food. There was plenty of suspicion. The remaining Jews with money in the neighborhood were emigrating. The Jews without money were also trying, but without much success. Max's family fell into the latter category. Walter checked on them occasionally, as inconspicuously as he could. One afternoon, when he visited, someone else opened the door.</div>

<div class="line_en">Halfway through 1939, just over six months into the period of hiding, they decided that a new course of action needed to be taken.
