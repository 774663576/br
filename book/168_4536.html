<div class="line_en">His legs were aching by the time Ser Axell thrust open a heavy door and gestured him through. Beyond, a high stone bridge arched over emptiness to the massive central tower called the Stone Drum. A sea wind blew restlessly through the arches that supported the roof, and Davos could smell the salt water as they crossed. He took a deep breath, filling his lungs with the clean cold air. Wind and water, give me strength, he prayed. A huge nightfire burned in the yard below, to keep the terrors of the dark at bay, and the queen's men were gathered around it, singing praises to their new red god.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="等亚赛尔爵士推开一道沉重的铁门，示意进入时，他的腿已又酸又痛。门的另一边是高架凌空的石拱桥，通往宏伟的中央塔楼——“石鼓楼”。海风不停穿越支撑桥顶的拱梁，戴佛斯闻到海水的气息。他深吸一口气，让自己的肺里填满清新凉爽。风和水，赐予我力量，他祈祷。下面院子里焚烧着巨大的夜火堆，以对抗长夜中的险恶，后党人士聚集在它周围，颂唱赞美他们的红神。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Up they went, climbing the turnpike stair in single file. The walls were rough dark stone, cool to the touch. The light of the torches went before them, and their shadows marched beside them on the walls. At the third turn they passed an iron gate that opened on blackness, and another at the fifth turn. Davos guessed that they were near the surface by then, perhaps even above it. The next door they came to was made of wood, but still they climbed. Now the walls were broken by arrow slits, but no shafts of sunlight pried their way through the thickness of the stone. It was night outside.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们成单列向上走，攀登蜿蜒的楼梯。墙壁是粗糙黑石，摸起来凉飕飕的。火炬的光芒在前方照耀，人们的影子于墙上行走。转第三个弯时，他们经过一道铁门，走入黑暗，第五个弯时又有一道门。戴佛斯猜想此间已近地表，甚至在地面之上。接下来是扇木门，他们继续攀登。墙上开了一个个箭孔，但没有阳光从厚厚的石头外射进来——现在是黑夜。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"The queen has urged my appointment," Ser Axell went on. "Even your old friend from Lys, the pirate Saan, he says the same. We have made a plan together, him and me. Yet His Grace does not act. The defeat gnaws inside him, a black worm in his soul. it is up to us who love him to show him what to do.

<div class="line_en">A ship. Davos studied the other man's face. Ser Axell had big Florent ears, much like the queen's. Coarse hair grew from them, as from his nostrils; more sprouted in tufts and patches beneath his double chin. His nose was broad, his brow beetled, his eyes close-set and hostile. He would sooner give me a pyre than a ship, he said as much, but if I do him this favor…</div>

Perhaps I cannot burn you without the king's consent, but who is to say you might not suffer a fall." He laid a meaty hand on the back of Davos's neck and shoved him bodily against the waist-high side of the bridge, then shoved a little harder to force his face out over the yard. "Do you hear me?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“若你背叛我，”亚赛尔爵士说，“请记住我担任龙石岛代理城主已经很久，卫兵都是我的人。未经国王准许，我也许不能烧死你，但谁说你不会不幸坠楼呢？”他将粗壮的手搭在戴佛斯脖后，把对方推向齐腰高的桥沿，迫使他的脸伸出去，看着下方的院子。“明白吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At the very top of Stone Drum, within the great round room called the Chamber of the Painted Table, they found Stannis Baratheon standing behind the artifact that gave the hall its name, a massive slab of wood carved and painted in the shape of Westeros as it had been in the time of Aegon the Conqueror. An iron brazier stood beside the king, its coals glowing a ruddy orange. Four tall pointed windows looked out to north, south, east, and west. Beyond was the night and the starry sky. Davos could hear the wind moving, and fainter, the sounds of the sea.</div>

<div class="line_en">"So I see." Stannis wore a grey wool tunic, a dark red mantle, and a plain black leather belt from which his sword and dagger hung. A red-gold crown with flame-shaped points encircled his brows. The look of him was a shock. He seemed ten years older than the man that Davos had left at Storm's End when he set sail for the Blackwater and the battle that would be their undoing. The king's close-cropped beard was spiderwebbed with grey hairs, and he had dropped two stone or more of weight. He had never been a fleshy man, but now the bones moved beneath his skin like spears, fighting to cut free. Even his crown seemed too large for his head. His eyes were blue pits lost in deep hollows, and the shape of a skull could be seen beneath his face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我知道了。”史坦尼斯穿灰羊毛外衣，暗红披风，系一条普通的黑皮带，上面挂着长剑和匕首，火焰形状的赤金王冠戴在头顶。但他的神态让戴佛斯大吃一惊。比起离开风息堡，航向黑水河，航向那场毁灭之战时，他仿佛老了十岁，剃短的胡须里遍布灰色毛发，而体重至少掉了两磅——他从来就不胖，如今骨头在皮肤下运动，好像长矛要戳出来，甚至连王冠也显得太大。他的眼睛成了深陷的蓝色凹穴，脸皮底可以看出头颅的形状。">查看中文翻译</div>

At Surnmerhall he won three battles in a single day, and brought Lords Grandison and Cafferen back to Storm's End as prisoners. He hung their banners in the hall as trophies. Cafferen's white fawns were spotted with blood and Grandison's sleeping lion was torn near in two. Yet they would sit beneath those banners of a night, drinking and feasting with Robert. He even took them hunting. 'These men meant to deliver you to Aerys to be burned,' I told him after I saw them throwing axes in the yard. 'You should not be putting axes in their hands.' Robert only laughed. I would have thrown Grandison and Cafferen into a dungeon, but he turned them into friends. Lord Cafferen died at Ashford Castle, cut down by Randyll Tarly whilst fighting for Robert. Lord Grandison was wounded on the Trident and died of it a year after.

Joffrey has no strength at sea until Lord Redwyne sets sail from the Arbor. The plunder might serve to keep that Lysene pirate Salladhor Saan loyal for a time. By itself Claw Isle is worthless, but its fall would serve notice to Lord Tywin that my cause is not yet done." The king turned back to Davos. "Speak truly, ser.

<div class="line_en">Ser Axell proposed to use Salladhor Saan's fleet and the men who had escaped the Blackwater -- Stannis still had some fifteen hundred on Dragonstone, more than half of them Florents -- to exact retribution for Lord Celtigar's defection. Claw Isle was but lightly garrisoned, its castle reputedly stuffed with Myrish carpets, Volantene glass, gold and silver plate, jeweled cups, magnificent hawks, an axe of Valyrian steel, a horn that could summon monsters from the deep, chests of rubies, and more wines than a man could drink in a hundred years. Though Celtigar had shown the world a niggardly face, he had never stinted on his own comforts. "Put his castle to the torch and his people to the sword, I say," Ser Axell concluded. "Leave Claw Isle a desolation of ash and bone, fit only for carrion crows, so the realm might see the fate of those who bed with Lannisters."</div>

He loved me but little, I know, yet he was my brother. The Lannister woman gave him horns and made a motley fool of him. She may have murdered him as well, as she murdered Jon Arryn and Ned Stark. For such crimes there must be justice. Starting with Cersei and her abominations. But only starting. I mean to scour that court clean. As Robert should have done, after the Trident. Ser Barristan once told me that the rot in King Aerys's reign began with Varys. The eunuch should never have been pardoned. No more than the Kingslayer. At the least, Robert should have stripped the white cloak from Jaime and sent him to the Wall, as Lord Stark urged. He listened to Jon Arryn instead.

My royal brother played the fond father on his visits to Storm's End, and there were gifts… swords and ponies and fur-trimmed cloaks. The eunuch's work, every one. The boy would write the Red Keep full of thanks, and Robert would laugh and ask Varys what he'd sent this year. Renly was no better.

<div class="line_en">Davos knelt, and Stannis drew his longsword. Lightbringer, Melisandre had named it; the red sword of heroes, drawn from the fires where the seven gods were consumed. The room seemed to grow brighter as the blade slid from its scabbard. The steel had a glow to it; now orange, now yellow, now red. The air shimmered around it, and no jewel had ever sparkled so brilliantly. But when Stannis touched it to Davos's shoulder, it felt no different than any other longsword. "Ser Davos of House Seaworth," the king said, /are you my true and honest liege man, now and forever?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"It is the great battle His Grace is speaking of," said a woman's voice, rich with the accents of the east. Melisandre stood at the door in her red silks and shimmering satins, holding a covered silver dish in her hands. "These little wars are no more than a scuffle of children before what is to come. The one whose name may not be spoken is marshaling his power, Davos Seaworth, a power fell and evil and strong beyond measure. Soon comes the cold, and the night that never ends." She placed the silver dish on the Painted Table. "Unless true men find the courage to fight it. Men whose hearts are fire."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“陛下所指是真正的大战，”一个女人用浓重的东方口音接道。梅丽珊卓就站在门口，身穿闪亮的滑丝长礼服，端一个覆盖子的银盘。“与即将到来的大战相比，你所谓的争夺不过是孩童打闹。那凡人不可道也的远古异神正在聚集力量，戴佛斯·席渥斯，可怕、邪恶而强大的力量，难以抗衡。冷风已然吹起，很快到来的将是永不终结的长夜。”她将银盘放到绘彩桌上。“除非正直的人们鼓起勇气，伸张烈焰红心的信仰。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"With mine own eyes. After the battle, when I was lost to despair, the Lady Melisandre bid me gaze into the hearthfire. The chimney was drawing strongly, and bits of ash were rising from the fire. I stared at them, feeling half a fool, but she bid me look deeper, and… the ashes were white, rising in the updraft, yet all at once it seemed as if they were falling. Snow, I thought. Then the sparks in the air seemed to circle, to become a ring of torches, and I was looking through the fire down on some high hill in a forest. The cinders had become men in black behind the torches, and there were shapes moving through the snow. For all the heat of the fire, I felt a cold so terrible I shivered, and when I did the sight was gone, the fire but a fire once again. But what I saw was real, I'd stake my kingdom on it."</div>

A victory even Robert could be proud of. Robert…" His teeth ground side to side. "He is in my dreams as well. Laughing. Drinking. Boasting. Those were the things he was best at. Those, and fighting.
