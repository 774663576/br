<div class="line_en">Captain Mark McCluskey sat in his office fingering three envelopes bulging with betting slips. He was frowning and wishing he could decode the notations on the slips. It was very important that he do so. The envelopes were the betting slips that his raiding parties had picked up when they had hit one of the Corleone Family bookmakers the night before. Now the bookmaker would have to buy back the slips so that players couldn't claim winners and wipe him out.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was very important for Captain McCluskey to decode the slips because he didn't want to get cheated when he sold the slips back to the bookmaker. If there was fifty grand worth of action, then maybe he could sell it back for five grand. But if there were a lot of heavy bets and the slips represented a hundred grand or maybe even two hundred grand, then the price should be considerably higher. McCluskey fiddled with the envelopes and then decided to let the bookie sweat a little bit and make the first offer. That might tip off what the real price should be.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="警官麦克罗斯基认出这些赌签上的记号是非常重要的，因为他要把这些赌签卖给赌场老板，他深怕受骗而少卖钱。如果赌注总值是五万美元，那他卖时就可得五千美元。但是，如果大赌注很多，而赌签总值是十万美元，或者甚至是二十万美元，那么卖价自然也要相应大大提高。麦克罗斯基在舞弄着纸袋，决定先敲老板的竹杠，让赌场老板自己先出个价。只要他出价，赌签真实总值也就可能有个眉目了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">His father had been a police sergeant, and every week father and son had walked through the precinct and McCluskey Senior had introduced his six-year-old son to the storekeepers, saying, "And this is my little boy."</div>

<div class="line_en">The storekeepers would shake his hand and compliment him extravagantly and ring open their cash registers to give the little boy a gift of five or ten dollars. At the end of the day, little Mark McCluskey would have all the pockets of his suit stuffed with paper money, would feel so proud that his father's friends liked him well enough to give him a present every month they saw him. Of course his father put the money in the bank for him, for his college education, and little Mark got at most a fifty-cent piece for himself.</div>

<div class="line_en">McCluskey looked at the station house clock on the wall of his office. It was time for him to pick up that greasy Turk, Sollozzo, and take him to wherever he was going to meet the Corleone Family. McCluskey went over to his wall locker and started to change into his civilian clothes. When he was finished he called his wife and told her he would not be home for supper that night, that he would be out on the job. He never confided in his wife on anything. She thought they lived the way they did on his policeman's salary. McCluskey grunted with amusement. His mother had thought the same thing but he had learned early. His father had shown him the ropes.</div>

<div class="line_en">He had been a good cop, a brave cop. The tough young punks terrorizing street corners fled when he approached and finally vanished from his beat altogether. He was a very tough cop and a very fair one. He never took his son around to the storekeepers to collect his money presents for ignoring garbage violations and parking violations; he took the money directly into his own hand, direct because he felt he earned it. He never ducked into a movie house or goofed off into restaurants when he was on foot patrol as some of the other cops did, especially on winter nights. He always made his rounds. He gave his stores a lot of protection, a lot of service. When winos and drunks filtered up from the Bowery to panhandle on his beat he got rid of them so roughly that they never came back. The tradespeople in his precinct appreciated it. And they showed their appreciation.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他是个称职的警察，一个勇敢的警察，那些身体强壮的小流氓在街头巷尾行凶闹事，一见他就逃跑了，最后硬是给他打得无影无踪了。他是一个非常坚强的警察，同时又是一个非常公正的警察。他绝不领着自己的小囝走东家串西家地到商店老板那里去，只顾搜括礼钱而忽略有关倒垃圾和停车的违章行为；他把罚款直接装进自己的腰包，因为他觉得那是他赚来的钱。当他徒步巡逻的时候，他绝不像某些警察那样动不动就钻进电影院或饭店，尤其在冬天晚上巡逻，他更是忠于职守，绝不乱窜。他总是按照规定路线来回走动，也真立下了汗马功劳。当酒鬼、醉汉从农场街流窜过来讨他打的时候，他就拳打脚踢地把他们赶跑。他们吃了亏，下回就再也不敢来了。他负责的地区内的商人很赏识他的这种作风，而且公开表示对他很赞赏。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">During the time he was raising a large family of four sons, none of whom became policemen. They all went to Fordham University and since by that time Mark McCluskey was rising from sergeant to lieutenant and finally to captain, they lacked for nothing. It was at this time that McCluskey got the reputation for being a hard bargainer. The bookmakers in his district paid more protection money than the bookmakers in any other part of the city, but maybe that was because of the expense of putting four boys through college.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他养着有四个儿子的一大家人，四个儿子全都上了福特姆大学。从那以后，马可·麦克罗斯基从上士巡佐爬到了少尉，最后爬到上尉。他一家什么也不缺，就是在这期间，麦克罗斯基获得了“抓钱铁手”的名声。他负责区域内的赌场老板付出的保护费比全市任何区域的赌场老板付出的保护费都要多。也许这是因为供四个男孩子念完大学的开支太大的缘故。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">McCluskey himself felt there was nothing wrong with clean graft. Why the hell should his kids go to CCNY or a cheap Southern college just because the Police Department didn't pay its people enough money to live on and take care of their families properly? He protected all these people with his life and his record showed his citations for gun duels with stickup men on his beat, strong-arm protection guys, would-be pimps. He had hammered them into the ground. He had kept his little corner of the city safe for ordinary people and he sure as hell was entitled to more than his lousy one C note a week. But he wasn't indignant about his low pay, he understood that everybody had to take care of themselves.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="麦克罗斯基觉得通过官方渠道捞些外快是无可厚非的。为什么他的孩子就该上县办专科学校或南方的花钱不多的什么学院？这究竟是为什么？难道是因为警察局出不起更多的钱，他们的家庭、子女也活该得不到妥善照顾吗？他用自己的生命保卫着千家万户；他的档案记录表明他屡受嘉奖，表扬他打了抢人的强盗、给人保镖的大汉、乱拉皮条的冒失鬼，而且还常常勇敢地进行一对一的枪战。他把这类人打得不敢露面。他把他负责的纽约市的一隅整治得成了普通老百姓的安全之地，也理所当然地应该得到比他每星期只领一百美元的微薄饷金更高的报酬。但是他对自己的低薪待遇并不怨恨，因为他很懂得人不为己天诛地灭的哲学。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He also obeyed the system. The bookies in his precinct knew he would never make trouble to get an extra payoff for himself, that he was content with his share of the station house bag. His name was on the list with the others and he never tried to make extras. He was a fair cop who took only clean graft and his rise in the police department was steady if not spectacular.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他也很遵守制度，他管区内的赌场老板都知道他绝不为了私人得外快而故意制造麻烦，他满足于他从警察局猎取的总数中分得的那一份。他的名字同其他警察的名字都是同样排列在贿赂的名单上的，但他个人从来不敲诈勒索。他是个只通过官方渠道受贿的公正的警察，因此他在警察局提升，虽然不算飞黄腾达，也算是稳稳当当地青云直上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Bruno Tattaglia was an old friend of his. Bruno had gone to Fordham with one of his sons and then Bruno had opened his nightclub and whenever the McCluskey family spent an infrequent night on the town, they could enjoy the cabaret with liquor and dinner -- on the house. On New Year's Eve they received engraved invitations to be guests of the management and always received one of the best tables. Bruno always made sure they were introduced to the celebrities who performed in his club, some of them famous singers and Hollywood stars. Of course sometimes he asked a little favor, like getting an employee with a record cleared for a cabaret work license, usually a pretty girl with a police dossier as a hustler or roller. McCluskey would be glad to oblige.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布鲁诺·塔塔格里亚是他的一个老朋友。布鲁诺上的也是福特姆大学，同他的一个儿子是同学。后来布鲁诺开办了夜总会，每当麦克罗斯基一家偶尔晚上上街消遣消遣的时候，他们就在夜总会一面吃吃喝喝，一面欣赏歌舞表演。大年除夕，他们都会收到经理部发来的镌版精印的请帖，每次都被请到位置最好的餐桌去，布鲁诺每次都把他们介绍给在他的夜总会表演的名流，有些是著名歌唱家，有些是好莱坞明星。当然，布鲁诺有时也会要他帮个小忙，比方他想雇一个历史不干净的人，就得先把污点去掉才能领到在酒吧间表演的执照，通常总是一个漂亮的姑娘，因为非法卖淫或趁机偷窃而在警察局有一宗档案材料。麦克罗斯基每次都会满口答应。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">McCluskey made it a policy never to show that he understood what other people were up to. When Sollozzo had approached him with the proposition to leave old man Corleone uncovered in the hospital, McCluskey didn't ask why. He asked price. When Sollozzo said ten grand, McCluskey knew why. He did not hesitate. Corleone was one of the biggest Mafia men in the country with more political connections than Capone had ever had. Whoever knocked him off would be doing the country a big favor. McCluskey took the money in advance and did the job. When he received a call from Sollozzo that there were still two of Corleone's men in front of the hospital he had flown into a rage. He had locked up all of Tessio's men, he had pulled the detective guards off the door of Corleone's hospital room. And now, being a man of principle, he would have to give back the ten grand, money he had already earmarked to insure the education of his grandchildren. It was in that rage that he had gone to the hospital and struck Michael Corleone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="麦克罗斯基的策略是：绝不表现出他懂得别人的意图。当索洛佐向他建议把医院的考利昂老头子设法置于无保护状态时，他并不问为什么，只问给多少钱。当索洛佐说一万美元时，麦克罗斯基就知道其中的奥妙了。他毫不犹豫地答应了下来。考利昂是最大的黑帮头目之一，他在政界的后门比任何神通广大的政客还要多。随便谁把他敲掉，也就等于给国家做了一件大好事。麦克罗斯基先把钱拿到手，然后就完成了任务。当他接到索洛佐的电话说医院门前仍然有考利昂家族的两个人时，他暴跳如雷。原来他把忒希奥手下的人全部关了起来；他把侦探警卫也从考利昂病房门口撤下来。而眼下，作为有原则性的人，他一定得把那一万美元退回去，这一万美元他早盘算好，预定为供他孙子上学的基金的。于是他带着那种怒不可遏的心情来到医院，打了迈克尔·考利昂。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">McCluskey sighed and got ready to leave the station house. Problems, always problems. His wife's sister in Ireland had just died after many years of fighting cancer and that cancer had cost him a pretty penny. Now the funeral would cost him more. His own uncles and aunts in the old country needed a little help now and then to keep their potato farms and he sent the money to do the trick. He didn't begrudge it. And when he and his wife visited the old country they were treated like a king and queen. Maybe they would go again this summer now that the war was over and with all this extra money coming in. McCluskey told his patrolman clerk where he would be if he was needed. He did not feel it necessary to take any precautions. He could always claim Sollozzo was an informer he was meeting. Outside the station house he walked a few blocks and then caught a cab to the house where he would meet with Sollozzo.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="麦克罗斯基叹了一口气，准备好要出发了。福不双至，祸不单行。他老婆的姐姐在爱尔兰同癌症斗争了好几年刚刚才死去，为了给她治病，他也破费了好多钱。眼下又是安葬费，他还得破费更多的钱。他的叔叔婶婶在爱尔兰也时常需要些帮助来维持他们的红苕农场。寄钱去也是另有目的的。钱他并不吝惜。他同老婆回国时受到的款待俨如衣锦还乡的国王和王后。也许来年夏天他们又回国了，一来因为战争结束了，二来因为有外快源源不断。麦克罗斯基告诉他的巡警秘书说：哪里需要他，他就到哪里去。他一向认为，就他个人而言，没有必要采取任何预防措施。他随时都可以声称索洛佐是他要去会见的一个告密的人。出了警察局，他走过几个街区，然后叫了辆出租汽车，直驱他约定的同索洛佐会面的房子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But it had all worked out for the best. He had met with Sollozzo in the Tattaglia nightclub and they had made an even better deal. Again McCluskey didn't ask questions, since he knew all the answers. He just made sure of his price. It never occurred to him that he himself could be in any danger. That anyone would consider even for a moment killing a New York City police captain was too fantastic. The toughest hood in the Mafia had to stand still if the lowliest patrolman decided to slap him around. There was absolutely no percentage in killing cops. Because then all of a sudden a lot of hoods were killed resisting arrest or escaping the scene of a crime, and who the hell was going to do anything about that?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，塞翁失马焉知是福。他在塔塔格里亚夜总会遇到了索洛佐，他俩谈妥了一笔更妙的交易。这一次麦克罗斯基仍然没有问任何问题，因为一切答案他都心中有数。他只落实了一下他该得多少钱。他压根没有想过他还会遇到什么危险。任何人也会认为：谁要是一时头脑发昏而企图杀掉纽约市一个上尉警官，那简直是太异想天开了。黑帮里最强悍的分子若碰到最下级的巡警要掴他的耳光，也只好乖乖地站着，动也不动。杀警察是绝对没有便宜可占的。这是因为：如果杀了警察，就会有许许多多的亡命之徒因拒捕或因企图逃离现场而被击毙。遇到这种情况，谁又敢于铤而走险呢？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Michael spent the day with Clemenza, practicing with the small gun that would be gotten to him. It was a.22 filled with soft-nosed bullets that made pinpricks going in and left insulting gaping holes when they exited from the human body. He found that it was accurate up to five of his steps away from a target. After that the bullets might go anywhere. The trigger was tight but Clemenza worked on this with some tools so that it pulled easier. They decided to leave it noisy. They didn't want an innocent bystander misunderstanding the situation and interfering out of ignorant courage. The report of the gun would keep them away from Michael.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈克尔一整天都同克莱门扎在一起，练习使用那支微型手枪。口径只有二点二毫米，里面装的子弹弹头是软的，打进去只有针孔那么一个洞眼，接触到人体就爆炸，出口处却留下很大的洞洞。他发现这支微型手枪离目标五步远打起来还是很准的，再远一点，子弹就击不中目标了。扳机不够灵活，克莱门扎修理了一下，扣起来灵活多了。这枪一打，有响声，他们决定，管它去，原因是他们想预防天真的旁观者对情况有误解，出于匹夫之勇而贸然干预。枪一响，旁观者就会躲开。">查看中文翻译</div>

Were they going to dump him into the swamps or was it just a last-minute change in meeting place by the wily Sollozzo? But when they were nearly all the way across, the driver gave the wheel a violent twist. The heavy automobile jumped into the air when it hit the divider and bounced over into the lanes going back to New York City. Both McCluskey and Sollozzo were looking back to see if anyone had tried doing the same thing. The driver was really hitting it back to New York and then they were off the bridge and going toward the East Bronx. They went through the side streets with no cars behind them. By this time it was nearly nine o'clock. They had made sure there was no one on their tail. Sollozzo lit up a cigarette after offering his pack to McCluskey and Michael, both of whom refused.

<div class="line_en">Sollozzo began speaking to Michael in rapid Sicilian. He said, "You must understand that what happened between me and your father was strictly a business matter. I have a great respect for Don Corleone and would beg for the opportunity to enter his service. But you must understand that your father is an old-fashioned man. He stands in the way of progress. The business I am in is the coming thing, the wave of the future, there are untold millions of dollars for everyone to make. But your father stands in the way because of certain unrealistic scruples. By doing this he imposes his will on men like myself. Yes, yes, I know, he says to me, 'Go ahead, it's your business,' but we both know that is unrealistic. We must tread on each other's corns. What he is really telling me is that I cannot operate my business. I am a man who respects himself and cannot let another man impose his will on me so what had to happen did happen. Let me say that I had the support, the silent support of all the New York Families. And the Tattaglia Family became my partners. If this quarrel continues, then the Corleone Family will stand alone against everyone. Perhaps if your father were well, it could be done. But the eldest son is not the man the Godfather is, no disrespect intended. And the Irish Consigliere, Hagen, is not the man Genco Abbandando was, God rest his soul. So I propose a peace, a truce. Let us cease all hostilities until your father is well again and can take part in these bargainings. The Tattaglia Family agrees, upon my persuasions and my indemnities, to forgo justice for their son Bruno. We will have peace. Meanwhile, I have to make a living and will do a little trading in my business. I do not ask your cooperation but I ask you, the Corleone Family, not to interfere. These are my proposals. I assume you have the authority to agree, to make a deal."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="索洛佐开始用西西里方言对迈克尔说话。“你必须明白我同你爸爸之间发生的问题纯粹是生意上的问题。我个人对考利昂老头子非常尊敬，巴不得能有机会为他效劳。但是你也必须明白，你爸爸已经老朽了，他成了生意路上的绊脚石。我目前从事的生意是有奔头的，也是未来的潮流，大家都能成百万美元地赚钱。但是你爸爸因为一些不切实际的清规戒律就踟蹰不前，阻碍了生意的前进。这样，他把他个人的意见甚至要强加于我这样的人身上。对，对，我知道，他对我说过：‘你自个儿去干吧，那是你自己的生意。’但是，我俩都知道那是不现实的。我们一定会互相触到对方的痛处。他实际上等于对我说，我的生意是做不成的。我是个有自尊心的人，不能让别人把他的意志强加于我，因此也就发生了必然要发生的事情。让我把话讲明白，我是有后台的，纽约所有的大家族都是我的后台，而塔塔格里亚家族是跟我搭伙干的。如果这场争吵继续下去，那么考利昂家族就会孤立，陷于四面楚歌。如果你爸爸的身体还好，那也许还可以顶得下去。而从另一方面讲，老大的为人根本不能同教父相提并论，我这话并没有贬的意思。而爱尔兰籍参谋黑根，论威望，也不能同劲科·阿班旦杜同日而语。愿上帝降福劲科的灵魂安息。因此，我提出讲和，提出休战。咱们还是先停止一切敌对行动吧，等你爸爸恢复健康，可以参加讨论的时候再说。由于我好说歹说，同时还提出补偿，塔塔格里亚家族才同意不为布鲁诺报仇。咱们之间会有和平的，同时我也得有个谋生之道，在我这一行里做点买卖。我并不要求你们合作，但我要求你们考利昂家族不要干扰。这，就是我的建议。我认为你是有权表示同意并达成协议的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

At that moment the waiter came to take their order and Sollozzo turned his head to speak to the waiter. Michael thrust the table away from him with his left hand and his right hand shoved the gun almost against Sollozzo's head. The man's coordination was so acute that he had already begun to fling himself away at Michael's motion. But Michael, younger, his reflexes sharper, pulled the trigger. The bullet caught Sollozzo squarely between his eye and his ear and when it exited on the other side blasted out a huge gout of blood and skull fragments onto the petrified waiter's jacket.

His veal-covered fork was suspended in his hand and his eyes were just turning on Michael. And the expression on his face, in his eyes, held such confident outrage, as if now he expected Michael to surrender or to run away, that Michael smiled at him as he pulled the trigger. This shot was bad, not mortal. It caught MeCluskey in his thick bull-like throat and he started to choke loudly as if he had swallowed too large a bite of the veal. Then the air seemed to fill with a fine mist of sprayed blood as he coughed it out of his shattered lungs. Very coolly, very deliberately, Michael fired the next shot through the top of his white-haired skull.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="只用了一秒钟，迈克尔就转过手枪，对准了麦克罗斯基。这位警官以旁观者的惊讶神色直瞪着索洛佐，仿佛这与他没有关系。他似乎还没有觉察到自己所面临的危险，手里拿着的叉子还叉着小牛肉，举在那儿一动不动；他的眼睛转过来瞅着迈克尔。他脸上和眼睛里的表情蕴藏着信心和愤怒，似乎他现在正等着迈克尔投降或逃跑。迈克尔向他微笑着扣动了扳机。这一枪没有打准，没有击中致命处，打到麦克罗斯基那像牛一样的粗脖子上。他呼呼地大声喘气，活像吞了一大口牛肉，咽不下去似的。他从碎裂的肺里咳血的时候，像是用喷雾器喷出来的一样，空中弥漫着血雾。迈克尔开了第二枪，打穿了他那披满白发的脑瓜盖。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The air seemed to be full of pink mist. Michael swung toward the man sitting against the wall. This man had not made a move. He seemed paralyzed. Now he carefully showed his hands on top of the table and looked away. The waiter was staggering back toward the kitchen, an expression of horror on his face, staring at Michael in disbelief. Sollozzo was still in his chair, the side of his body propped up by the table. McCluskey, his heavy body pulling downward, had fallen off his chair onto the floor. Michael let the gun slip out of his hand so that it bound off his body and made no noise. He saw that neither the man against the wall nor the waiter had noticed him dropping the gun. He strode the few steps toward the door and opened it. Sollozzo's car was parked at the curb still, but there was no sign of the driver. Michael turned left and around the corner. Headlights flashed on and a battered sedan pulled up to him, the door swinging open. He jumped in and the car roared away. He saw that it was Tessio at the wheel, his trim features hard as marble.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="空中弥漫着粉红色的雾。迈克尔向靠墙坐着的那个人转过身来。这个人没有动，像是给吓瘫了，小心翼翼地把手亮在桌面上，故意转过脸去。堂棺倌蹒蹒跚跚地向厨房退去，脸上带着惊恐的神色。索洛佐仍然像坐在原来的椅子上，身上的侧面靠着桌子。麦克罗斯基那笨重的身子垮下去了，从椅子上滑下来，掉到地板上。迈克尔垂下胳膊，让枪从手中滑脱，沿着身子掉下去，没有什么响声。他看到靠墙坐的那个人和堂倌都没有注意到他把枪丢了下去。他跨了几步就到门口，自己开门出去了。索洛佐的汽车仍然还停在马路边，但是不见司机的影子。迈克尔朝左，绕过了拐弯处。一辆汽车的前灯亮了，这辆破烂不堪的小轿车停在他跟前，车门也同时打开了。他一步跨了进去，汽车“呜呜”地开走了。他认出开车的是忒希奥，忒希奥那端庄的脸板得像大理石。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">On the day after the murder of Sollozzo and Captain McCluskey, the police captains and lieutenants in every station house in New York City sent out the word: there would be no more gambling, no more prostitution, no more deals of any kind until the murderer of Captain McCluskey was caught. Massive raids began all over the city. All unlawful business activities came to a standstill.</div>

<div class="line_en">There was a change of clothes for Michael in the car. Twenty minutes later he was on an Italian freighter slated for Sicily. Two hours later the freighter put out to sea and from his cabin Michael could see the lights of New York City burning like the fires of hell. He felt an enormous sense of relief. He was out of it now. The feeling was familiar and he remembered being taken off the beach of an island his Marine division had invaded. The battle had been still going on but he had received a slight wound and was being ferried back to a hospital ship. He had felt the same overpowering relief then that he felt now. All hell would break loose but he wouldn't be there.</div>

<div class="line_en">Later that day an emissary from the Families asked the Corleone Family if they were prepared to give up the murderer. They were told that the affair did not concern them. That night a bomb exploded in the Corleone Family mall in Long Beach, thrown from a car that pulled up to the chain, then roared away. That night also two button men of the Corleone Family were killed as they peaceably ate their dinner in a small Italian restaurant in Greenwich Village. The Five Families War of 1946 had begun.</div>
