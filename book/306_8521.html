<div class="line_en">More than once in the course of my story I have referred to my love of the country and out-of-door sports. When I was quite a little girl, I learned to row and swim, and during the summer, when I am at Wrentham, Massachusetts, I almost live in my boat. Nothing gives me greater pleasure than to take my friends out rowing when they visit me. Of course, I cannot guide the boat very well. Someone usually sits in the stern and manages the rudder while I row. Sometimes, however, I go rowing without the rudder. It is fun to try to steer by the scent of watergrasses and lilies, and of bushes that grow on the shore. I use oars with leather bands, which keep them in position in the oarlocks, and I know by the resistance of the water when the oars are evenly poised. In the same manner I can also tell when I am pulling against the current. I like to contend with wind and wave. What is more exhilarating than to make your staunch little boat, obedient to your will and muscle, go skimming lightly over glistening, tilting waves, and to feel the steady, imperious surge of the water!</div>

<div class="line_en">I also enjoy canoeing, and I suppose you will smile when I say that I especially like it on moonlight nights. I cannot, it is true, see the moon climb up the sky behind the pines and steal softly across the heavens, making a shining path for us to follow; but I know she is there, and as I lie back among the pillows and put my hand in the water, I fancy that I feel the shimmer of her garments as she passes. Sometimes a daring little fish slips between my fingers, and often a pond-lily presses shyly against my hand. Frequently, as we emerge from the shelter of a cove or inlet, I am suddenly conscious of the spaciousness of the air about me. A luminous warmth seems to enfold me. Whether it comes from the trees which have been heated by the sun, or from the water, I can never discover. I have had the same strange sensation even in the heart of the city. I have felt it on cold, stormy days and at night. It is like the kiss of warm lips on my face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我也喜欢划独木舟。我想当你们听说我特别喜欢月夜泛舟时，一定会微微一笑。说真的，我看不见月亮从松树后升上天空，悄然在天际间穿行，为我们铺就发光的小径。但是，我知道月亮就在那里。我仰面躺在垫子上，把手放在水中。这时，我幻想感觉到她在天空经过时微光闪烁的外衣。有时候，一条大胆的小鱼儿从我指间滑过，睡莲则常常害羞地从我手上擦过。当我们从小河湾或河港里划出来，我经常会感到，自己周围的空间骤然开阔起来。一股明亮的暖气似乎将我围裹其中，它是来自被阳光晒热的林木，还是来自水面，我无从辨别。甚至在城市的中心，我也有这种奇怪的感觉。在寒冷的日子，在暴风雨的天气，在夜晚，我都感觉到它的气息。这好似温暖的双唇吻在脸上的感觉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">My favourite amusement is sailing. In the summer of 1901 I visited Nova Scotia, and had opportunities such as I had not enjoyed before to make the acquaintance of the ocean. After spending a few days in Evangeline's country, about which Longfellow's beautiful poem has woven a spell of enchantment, Miss Sullivan and I went to Halifax, where we remained the greater part of the summer. The harbour was our joy, our paradise. What glorious sails we had to Bedford Basin, to McNabb's Island, to York Redoubt, and to the Northwest Arm! And at night what soothing, wondrous hours we spent in the shadow of the great, silent men-of-war. Oh, it was all so interesting, so beautiful! The memory of it is a joy forever.</div>

<div class="line_en">One day we had a thrilling experience. There was a regatta in the Northwest Arm, in which the boats from the different warships were engaged. We went in a sail-boat along with many others to watch the races. Hundreds of little sail-boats swung to and fro close by, and the sea was calm. When the races were over, and we turned our faces homeward, one of the party noticed a black cloud drifting in from the sea, which grew and spread and thickened until it covered the whole sky. The wind rose, and the waves chopped angrily at unseen barriers. Our little boat confronted the gale fearlessly; with sails spread and ropes taut, she seemed to sit upon the wind. Now she swirled in the billows, now she spring upward on a gigantic wave, only to be driven down with angry howl and hiss. Down came the mainsail. Tacking and jibbing, we wrestled with opposing winds that drove us from side to side with impetuous fury. Our hearts beat fast, and our hands trembled with excitement, not fear, for we had the hearts of vikings, and we knew that our skipper was master of the situation. He had steered through many a storm with firm hand and sea-wise eye. As they passed us, the large craft and the gunboats in the harbour saluted and the seamen shouted applause for the master of the only little sail-boat that ventured out into the storm. At last, cold, hungry and weary, we reached our pier.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一天，发生了一件令人惊心动魄的事。西北海湾有一场划船比赛，各军舰皆派小船参赛。我们乘一只帆船观看比赛，夹在许多帆船当中。数以百计的帆船在附近来回摆动，海面风平浪静。比赛结束后，我们掉头回家，有人注意到一块黑云从海面飘来。云越积越多，越积越厚，遮住了整个天空。风刮了起来，海浪狂暴地向看不见的障碍打去。我们的小船面对大风，无所畏惧。她张满帆，拉紧绳，仿佛坐到了风上。她一会儿在滚滚波涛中打转，一会儿又跃上巨大的浪头，接着又在怒号声、咝咝声中被抛下。主桅的帆落了下来。抢风调向，逡巡不前，我们怀着极大的愤怒与把我们刮得左右摇摆的顶头风搏斗着。我们心跳加速，双手颤抖，不是因为害怕，而是由于兴奋。我们有北欧海盗的坚毅，知道船长会化险为夷。他凭着结实的双手和谙熟大海的眼睛，闯过了无数风暴。港湾里的大船和几艘炮艇在我们船旁驶过时，鸣号向我们致敬，水手们欢呼，向这位冒险在暴风雨中出航的小帆船船长致意。最后驶抵码头时，我们又饿又冷，疲惫不堪。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Last summer I spent in one of the loveliest nooks of one of the most charming villages in New England. Wrentham, Massachusetts, is associated with nearly all of my joys and sorrows. For many years Red Farm, by King Philip's Pond, the home of Mr. J. E. Chamberlin and his family, was my home. I remember with deepest gratitude the kindness of these dear friends and the happy days I spent with them. The sweet companionship of their children meant much to me. I joined in all their sports and rambles through the woods and frolics in the water. The prattle of the little ones and their pleasure in the stories I told them of elf and gnome, of hero and wily bear, are pleasant things to remember. Mr. Chamberlin initiated me into the mysteries of tree and wild-flower, until with the little ear of love I heard the flow of sap in the oak, and saw the sun glint from leaf to leaf.

<div class="line_en">But I must not forget that I was going to write about last summer in particular. As soon as my examinations were over, Miss Sullivan and I hastened to this green nook, where we have a little cottage on one of the three lakes for which Wrentham is famous. Here the long, sunny days were mine, and all thoughts of work and college and the noisy city were thrust into the background. In Wrentham we caught echoes of what was happening in the world -- war, alliance, social conflict. We heard of the cruel, unnecessary fighting in the far-away Pacific, and learned of the struggles going on between capital and labour. We knew that beyond the border of our Eden men were making history by the sweat of their brows when they might better make a holiday. But we little heeded these things. These things would pass away; here were lakes and woods and broad daisy-starred fields and sweet-breathed meadows, and they shall endure forever.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the country one sees only Nature's fair works, and one's soul is not saddened by the cruel struggle for mere existence that goes on in the crowded city. Several times I have visited the narrow, dirty streets where the poor live, and I grow hot and indignant to think that good people should be content to live in fine houses and become strong and beautiful, while others are condemned to live in hideous, sunless tenements and grow ugly, withered and cringing. The children who crowd these grimy alleys, half-clad and underfed, shrink away from your outstretched hand as if from a blow. Dear little creatures, they crouch in my heart and haunt me with a constant sense of pain. There are men and women, too, all gnarled and bent out of shape. I have felt their hard, rough hands and realized what an endless struggle their existence must be -- no more than a series of scrimmages, thwarted attempts to do something. Their life seems an immense disparity between effort and opportunity. The sun and the air are God's free gifts to all we say, but are they so? In yonder city's dingy alleys the sun shines not, and the air is foul. Oh, man, how dost thou forget and obstruct thy brother man, and say, "Give us this day our daily bread," when he has none! Oh, would that men would leave the city, its splendour and its tumult and its gold, and return to wood and field and simple, honest living! Then would their children grow stately as noble trees, and their thoughts sweet and pure as wayside flowers. It is impossible not to think of all this when I return to the country after a year of work in town.</div>

<div class="line_en">Museums and art stores are also sources of pleasure and inspiration. Doubtless it will seem strange to many that the hand unaided by sight can feel action, sentiment, beauty in the cold marble; and yet it is true that I derive genuine pleasure from touching great works of art. As my finger tips trace line and curve, they discover the thought and emotion which the artist has portrayed. I can feel in the faces of gods and heroes hate, courage and love, just as I can detect them in living faces I am permitted to touch. I feel in Diana's posture the grace and freedom of the forest and the spirit that tames the mountain lion and subdues the fiercest passions. My soul delights in the repose and gracious curves of the Venus; and in Barre's bronzes the secrets of the jungle are revealed to me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="博物馆和艺术馆也是欢乐和灵感的源泉。毫无疑问，许多人都觉得很奇怪，我竟然不用眼睛就能感觉到冷冰冰的大理石所表现的动作、情感和美！然而，我确实能从抚摸这些艺术杰作中获得真正的快乐。我的指尖触摸到这些艺术品的轮廓和曲线时，就能感受到艺术家们所要表达的思想和情感。从诸神和英雄雕像的脸上，我能感觉到爱与恨、勇气与爱情，就像我能从真人脸上摸出情感和品格一样。从狄安娜[72]的姿势，我感觉到森林的优雅与自由，以及驯服山狮和抑制最强烈欲望的精神。维纳斯雕像的安详和优雅曲线，使我的心灵感到愉悦，而巴雷[73]的铜像则向我揭示了丛林的秘密。【注：[72]即希腊神话中的阿耳忒弥斯，是奥林匹斯山的月神和狩猎女神。[73]让奥古斯特·巴雷（1811—1896），法国雕刻家。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">If there are children around, nothing pleases me so much as to frolic with them. I find even the smallest child excellent company, and I am glad to say that children usually like me. They lead me about and show me the things they are interested in. Of course the little ones cannot spell on their fingers; but I manage to read their lips. If I do not succeed they resort to dumb show. Sometimes I make a mistake and do the wrong thing. A burst of childish laughter greets my blunder, and the pantomime begins all over again. I often tell them stories or teach them a game, and the winged hours depart and leave us good and happy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有小孩子在身边时，我最喜欢同他们闹着玩。我发现，即便是一点点大的孩子，也能成为我的好伙伴。孩子们通常都喜欢我，这使我很高兴。他们会领着我四处走动，把他们感兴趣的东西指给我看。当然，小孩子不会用手指拼写，但是我可以设法读懂他们的唇语。如果我搞不懂，他们就会打手势。有时候，我会犯错，做出错误举动，孩子们就会哄堂大笑。于是，这场哑剧又得重新开始。我常会给他们讲故事或者教他们做游戏，时间就这样匆匆流逝，给我们留下的是满足和快乐。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A medallion of Homer hangs on the wall of my study, conveniently low, so that I can easily reach it and touch the beautiful, sad face with loving reverence. How well I know each line in that majestic brow -- tracks of life and bitter evidences of struggle and sorrow; those sightless eyes seeking, even in the cold plaster, for the light and the blue skies of his beloved Hellas, but seeking in vain; that beautiful mouth, firm and true and tender. It is the face of a poet, and of a man acquainted with sorrow. Ah, how well I understand his deprivation -- the perpetual night in which he dwelt --</div>

<div class="line_en">Another pleasure, which comes more rarely than the others, is going to the theatre. I enjoy having a play described to me while it is being acted on the stage far more than reading it, because then it seems as if I were living in the midst of stirring events. It has been my privilege to meet a few great actors and actresses who have the power of so bewitching you that you forget time and place and live again in the romantic past. I have been permitted to touch the face and costume of Miss Ellen Terry as she impersonated our ideal of a queen; and there was about her that divinity that hedges sublimest woe. Beside her stood Sir Henry Irving, wearing the symbols of kingship; and there was majesty of intellect in his every gesture and attitude and the royalty that subdues and overcomes in every line of his sensitive face. In the king's face, which he wore as a mask, there was a remoteness and inaccessibility of grief which I shall never forget.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="进戏院是比较少有的一种娱乐。我喜欢有人在舞台上的表演正进行时给我讲述剧情，这比读剧本有趣得多，因为常常会使我仿佛身临其境。我有幸见过一些著名演员，他们演技高超，能使你忘却时间地点，随他们回到浪漫的古代。埃伦·特里小姐在扮演我们心目中理想的王后时，允许我抚摸她的脸庞和服饰，她身上透出的超凡完美掩饰了极度的悲伤。亨利·欧文勋爵佩戴着王权标志站在她的身旁，他的行为举止无不显露出超群出众的才智，他敏感的脸上的每一根线条都透露出一种压抑不住的威严。在他那张戴着面具的国王脸上，有一种冷漠、无法琢磨的悲愤神情，令我永远不能忘怀。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I also know Mr. Jefferson. I am proud to count him among my friends. I go to see him whenever I happen to be where he is acting. The first time I saw him act was while at school in New York. He played "Rip Van Winkle." I had often read the story, but I had never felt the charm of Rip's slow, quaint, kind ways as I did in the play. Mr. Jefferson's, beautiful, pathetic representation quite carried me away with delight. I have a picture of old Rip in my fingers which they will never lose. After the play Miss Sullivan took me to see him behind the scenes, and I felt of his curious garb and his flowing hair and beard. Mr. Jefferson let me touch his face so that I could imagine how he looked on waking from that strange sleep of twenty years, and he showed me how poor old Rip staggered to his feet.</div>

<div class="line_en">I have also seen him in "The Rivals." Once while I was calling on him in Boston he acted the most striking parts of "The Rivals" for me. The reception-room where we sat served for a stage. He and his son seated themselves at the big table, and Bob Acres wrote his challenge. I followed all his movements with my hands, and caught the drollery of his blunders and gestures in a way that would have been impossible had it all been spelled to me. Then they rose to fight the duel, and I followed the swift thrusts and parries of the swords and the waverings of poor Bob as his courage oozed out at his finger ends. Then the great actor gave his coat a hitch and his mouth a twitch, and in an instant I was in the village of Falling Water and felt Schneider's shaggy head against my knee. Mr. Jefferson recited the best dialogues of "Rip Van Winkle," in which the tear came close upon the smile. He asked me to indicate as far as I could the gestures and action that should go with the lines. Of course, I have no sense whatever of dramatic action, and could make only random guesses; but with masterful art he suited the action to the word. The sigh of Rip as he murmurs, "Is a man so soon forgotten when he is gone?" the dismay with which he searches for dog and gun after his long sleep, and his comical irresolution over signing the contract with Derrick -- all these seem to be right out of life itself; that is, the ideal life, where things happen as we think they should.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我还看了他表演的《情敌》[74]。有一次，我在波士顿看望他时，他给我表演了《情敌》中最精彩的片段。我们待的会客厅成了舞台。他和他儿子坐在大桌子上，鲍勃·阿克尔斯写着挑战书。我用手模仿他的所有动作，领会了他犯下大错时的滑稽可笑，理解了他所有的手势，而光是别人将故事拼写在我手上是无法做到这一点的。接着，他们站起来决斗，我注意到宝剑之间的突刺与闪避，以及可怜的鲍勃勇气渐渐丧失时的犹豫摇摆。接着，这位大演员猛地拉一下外衣，嘴角骤然一抽。突然间，我来到了落水山庄，觉得施奈德蓬松的头抵住了我的膝盖。杰斐逊先生朗诵起《瑞普·凡·温克尔》里那段最著名的对话，一会儿喜笑颜开，一会儿又声泪俱下。他要我尽量指出配合台词应该做些什么手势和动作。当然，我一点儿也不懂舞台动作，只能根据猜测随意说几句。可是，他用精湛的艺术，为台词配上了动作。瑞普长叹一声，喃喃地说：“难道一个人在离去后这么快就被遗忘了吗？”他在经历过长眠之后寻找狗和枪的失望，他与德里克签订合约时表现出的滑稽可笑的优柔寡断，所有这些都好像来自生活本身，即理想中的生活，在那里，事情按照我们设想的方式发生。【注：[74]英国喜剧作家理查德·谢里丹（1751—1816）的作品。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I remember well the first time I went to the theatre. It was twelve years ago. Elsie Leslie, the little actress, was in Boston, and Miss Sullivan took me to see her in "The Prince and the Pauper." I shall never forget the ripple of alternating joy and woe that ran through that beautiful little play, or the wonderful child who acted it. After the play I was permitted to go behind the scenes and meet her in her royal costume. It would have been hard to find a lovelier or more lovable child than Elsie, as she stood with a cloud of golden hair floating over her shoulders, smiling brightly, showing no signs of shyness or fatigue, though she had been playing to an immense audience. I was only just learning to speak, and had previously repeated her name until I could say it perfectly. Imagine my delight when she understood the few words I spoke to her and without hesitation stretched her hand to greet me.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sometimes, it is true, a sense of isolation enfolds me like a cold mist as I sit alone and wait at life's shut gate. Beyond there is light, and music, and sweet companionship; but I may not enter. Fate, silent, pitiless, bars the way. Fain would I question his imperious decree, for my heart is still undisciplined and passionate; but my tongue will not utter the bitter, futile words that rise to my lips, and they fall back into my heart like unshed tears. Silence sits immense upon my soul. Then comes hope with a smile and whispers, "There is joy in self-forgetfulness." So I try to make the light in others' eyes my sun, the music in others' ears my symphony, the smile on others' lips my happiness.</div>
