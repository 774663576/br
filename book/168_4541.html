<div class="line_en">The ground was littered with pine needles and blown leaves, a carpet of green and brown still damp from the recent rains. It squished beneath their feet. Huge bare oaks, tall sentinels, and hosts of soldier pines stood all around them. On a hill above them was another roundtower, ancient and empty, thick green moss crawling up its side almost to the summit. "Who built that, all of stone like that?" Ygritte asked him. "Some king?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Brandon's Gift had been farmed for thousands of years, but as the Watch dwindled there were fewer hands to plow the fields, tend the bees, and plant the orchards, so the wild had reclaimed many a field and hall.

<div class="line_en">In legend, Brandon the Builder had used giants to help raise Winterfell, but Jon did not want to confuse the issue. "Men can build a lot higher than this. In Oldtown there's a tower taller than the Wall." He could tell she did not believe him.

We could bathe in the hot pools, and love beneath the heart tree while the old gods watched over us.</div>

<div class="line_en">His lord father had once talked about raising new lords and settling them in the abandoned holdfasts as a shield against wildlings. The plan would have required the Watch to yield back a large part of the Gift, but his uncle Benjen believed the Lord Commander could be won around, so long as the new lordlings paid taxes to Castle Black rather than Winterfell. "It is a dream for spring, though," Lord Eddard had said. "Even the promise of land will not lure men north with a winter coming on."</div>

From there Styr marched them deep into the Gift, to avoid the Watch's customary patrols. Grigg the Goat led them past the few inhabited villages that remained in these lands.

He was never sent out to forage or hunt, nor allowed to stand a watch alone. And he feared for Ygritte as well.

<div class="line_en">The Therms were hardened warriors, and more disciplined than the common run of wildling; no doubt that was why Mance had chosen them. The defenders of Castle Black would include blind Maester Aemon and his half-blind steward Clydas, one-armed Donal Noye, drunken Septon Cellador, Deaf Dick Follard, Three-Finger Hobb the cook, old Ser Wynton Stout, as well as Halder and Toad and Pyp and Albett and the rest of the boys who'd trained with Jon. And commanding them would be red-faced Bowen Marsh, the plump Lord Steward who had been made castellan in Lord Mormont's absence. Dolorous Edd sometimes called Marsh "the Old Pomegranate," which fit him just as well as "the Old Bear" fit Mon mont. "He's the man you want in front when the foes are in the field," Edd would say in his usual dour voice. "He'll count them right up for you. A regular demon for counting, that one."</div>

The smell of her had become a part of him. Her crooked teeth, the feel of her breast when he cupped it in his hand, the taste of her mouth… they were his joy and his despair.

And yet… the Therms spoke the Old Tongue and seldom talked to Jon at all, but it was different with Jarl's raiders, the men who'd climbed the Wall. Jon was coming to know them despite himself: gaunt, quiet Errok and gregarious Grigg the Goat, the boys Quort and Bodger, Hempen Dan the ropernaker. The worst of the lot was Del, a horsefaced youth near Jon's own age, who would talk dreamily of this wildling girl he meant to steal. "She's lucky, like your Ygritte. She's kissed by fire."</div>

Grass rose waist high around them, and stands of wild wheat swayed gently when the wind came gusting, but for the most part the day was warm and bright. Toward sunset, however, clouds began to threaten in the west. They soon engulfed the orange sun, and Lerm foretold a bad storm coming. His mother was a woods witch, so all the raiders agreed he had a gift for foretelling the weather. "There's a village close," Grigg the Goat told the Magnar. "Two miles, three.

He didn't want to hear about the boil on Big Boil's arse, how much ale Stone Thumbs could drink, or how Quort's little brother had begged him not to go with Jarl. Quort could not have been older than fourteen, though he'd already stolen himself a wife and had a child on the way. "Might be he'll be born in some castle," the boy boasted.

The village sat beside a lake, and had been so long abandoned that most of the houses had collapsed. Even the small timber inn that must once have been a welcome sight for travelers stood half-fallen and roofless. We will find scant shelter here, Jon thought gloomily.

The broken branches the old man had been burning seemed to generate more smoke than heat, but any warmth was welcome on such a wild rainy night.

<div class="line_en">He is an old man, Jon told himself. Fifty, maybe even sixty. He lived a longer life than most. The Thenns will kill him anyway, nothing I can say or do will save him. Longclaw seemed heavier than lead in his hand, too heavy to lift. The man kept staring at him, with eyes as big and black as wells. I will fall into those eyes and drown. The Magnar was looking at him too, and he could almost taste the mistrust. The man is dead. What matter if it is my hand that slays him? One cut would do it, quick and clean. Longclaw was forged of Valyrian steel. Like Ice. Jon remembered another killing; the deserter on his knees, his head rolling, the brightness of blood on snow… his father's sword, his father's words, his father's face…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他是个老人，琼恩告诉自己，五十岁，甚至有六十岁，比大多数人活得长。但瑟恩人会杀了他，不管我说什么或做什么都救不了。长爪仿佛比铅还重，难以提起。那人继续瞪他，眼睛像又大又黑的井。我会掉进这口井里淹死。马格拿也在看他，他几乎可以闻到猜疑的味道。这人一定会死，由我来杀，又有什么关系呢？只需利落一刀，用尽全身力气。长爪是瓦雷利亚钢铸成。跟“寒冰”一样。琼恩记起另一次行刑：逃兵跪在地上，脑袋滚落，雪地上明亮的鲜血…父亲的剑，父亲的话，父亲的脸…">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The lightning flash left Jon night-blind, but he glimpsed the hurtling shadow half a heartbeat before he heard the shriek. The first Therm died as the old man had, blood gushing from his torn throat. Then the light was gone and the shape was spinning away, snarling, and another man went down in the dark. There were curses, shouts, howls of pain. Jon saw Big Boil stumble backward and knock down three men behind him. Ghost, he thought for one mad instant. Ghost leapt the Wall. Then the lightning turned the night to day, and he saw the wolf standing on Del's chest, blood running black from his jaws. Grey. He's grey.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="闪电的强光令琼恩看不清楚，但在听见惨叫之前的刹那，他瞥到一个疾驰的影子。头一个瑟恩人死得和老人一样，血从撕裂的喉咙里涌出。然后闪光消失，影子转身，一声咆哮，又一人在黑暗中倒下。到处是咒骂、呼喊和痛苦的嚎叫。琼恩看见大疖子跌跌撞撞地向后倒去，撞翻了三个人。是白灵，他疯狂地想，白灵跳过长城来救我。接着，闪电又将黑夜变成白昼，他看到那头狼踩在德尔胸膛，黑乎乎的血从口中流下。灰的。他是灰的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="死亡咆哮着扑来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He cut down the first man as he turned toward the wolf, shoved past a second, slashed at a third. Through the madness he heard someone call his name, but whether it was Ygritte or the Magnar he could not say. The Thenn fighting to control the horse never saw him. Longclaw was feather-light. He swung at the back of the man's calf, and felt the steel bite down to the bone. When the wildling fell the mare bolted, but somehow Jon managed to grab her mane with his off hand and vault himself onto her back. A hand closed round his ankle, and he hacked down and saw Bodger's face dissolve in a welter of blood. The horse reared, lashing out. one hoof caught a Thenn in the temple, with a crunch.</div>

<div class="line_en">And then they were running. Jon made no effort to guide the horse. It was all he could do to stay on her as they plunged through mud and rain and thunder. Wet grass whipped at his face and a spear flew past his ear. If the horse stumbles and breaks a leg, they will run me down and kill me, he thought, but the old gods were with him and the horse did not stumble. Lightning shivered through the black dome of sky, and thunder rolled across the plains. The shouts dwindled and died behind him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="随后人马开始狂奔。琼恩没有引导方向，只尽力伏在马背上，穿越泥沼、雨水和雷电。湿草抽打着脸，一支长矛从耳际飞过。若马跌断腿脚，他们便会追上来，把我杀死，他心想，但旧神与他同在，马儿没事。闪电划过黑暗的天顶，雷声在平原上翻滚，呐喊在身后减弱消失。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Long hours later, the rain stopped. Jon found himself alone in a sea of tall black grass. There was a deep throbbing ache in his right thigh. When he looked down, he was surprised to see an arrow jutting out the back of it. When did that happen? He grabbed hold of the shaft and gave it a tug, but the arrowhead was sunk deep in the meat of his leg, and the pain when he pulled on it was excruciating. He tried to think back on the madness at the inn, but all he could remember was the beast, gaunt and grey and terrible. It was too large to be a common wolf. A direwolf, then. It had to be. He had never seen an animal move so fast. Like a grey wind… Could Robb have returned to the north?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="午夜后，雨停止，琼恩独自徘徊在高高的黑草海中，右大腿痛得厉害。他低头看去，惊讶地发现一支箭戳进大腿后面。什么时候的事？他抓住箭杆，拉了一下，但箭头深埋进肉中，越拔痛得越厉害。他试图回想客栈中狂乱的景象，但只能记起那头灰色的野兽，精瘦而可怖。它太大，不是普通的狼。冰原狼。只可能如此。他从没见过行为如此之快的动物。就像一阵灰色的风…难道罗柏回了北方？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Clumsily, he slid down off the mare's back. His wounded leg buckled under him, and he had to swallow a scream. This is going to be agony. The arrow had to come out, though, and nothing good could come of waiting. Jon curled his hand around the fletching, took a deep breath, and shoved the arrow forward. He grunted, then cursed. It hurt so much he had to stop. I am bleeding like a butchered pig, he thought, but there was nothing to be done for it until the arrow was out. He grimaced and tried again… and soon stopped again, trembling. Once more. This time he screamed, but when he was done the arrowhead was poking through the front of his thigh. Jon pushed back his bloody breeches to get a better grip, grimaced, and slowly drew the shaft through his leg. How he got through that without fainting he never knew.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他笨拙地滑下母马的背，受伤的腿顿时一软，令他不得不咽下尖叫。会很痛苦。然而箭必须弄出来，等待没有好处。于是琼恩握住箭羽，深吸一口气，往前推去。他闷哼，接着咒骂。实在太疼，做到一半就停了下来。我像头被屠宰的猪一样血流如注，他心想，但只能继续，别无选择。于是他满心不情愿地再度尝试…很快又颤抖着停止。再来一次。这次他喊叫出声，箭头总算从大腿前面穿了出去。琼恩将染血的裤子往后褪开，以便抓得更牢，然后皱紧了脸，缓缓将箭杆穿过腿部。他不知自己为何没有晕厥。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He lay on the ground afterward, clutching his prize and bleeding quietly, too weak to move. After a while, he realized that if he did not make himself move he was like to bleed to death. Jon crawled to the shallow stream where the mare was drinking, washed his thigh in the cold water, and bound it tight with a strip of cloth torn from his cloak. He washed the arrow too, turning it in his hands. Was the fletching grey, or white? Ygritte fletched her arrows with pale grey goose feathers. Did she loose a shaft at me as I fled? Jon could not blame her for that. He wondered if she'd been aiming for him or the horse. If the mare had gone down, he would have been doomed. "A lucky thing my leg got in the way," he muttered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="之后，他抓着“战利品”，躺在地上，静静地流血。太虚弱，走不动。过了一会儿，他意识到如果不强迫自己动起来，很可能流血至死。于是琼恩爬到浅溪旁——母马正在那儿喝水——用冷水清洗大腿，然后从斗篷上扯下一条布，紧紧包扎起来。他把箭也洗了洗，拿在手里仔细观察。羽毛是灰的还是白的？耶哥蕊特用淡灰色鹅毛做箭羽。箭是她放的吗？他不能怪她。不知她是瞄准自己还是瞄准坐骑。若那母马倒下，我就完了。“幸亏腿挡在中间。”他喃喃道。">查看中文翻译</div>
