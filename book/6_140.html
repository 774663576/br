<div class="line_en">A fortnight later, we returned to London, and I began to prepare for my battle with the Count. It was now early May and the rental agreement for his house ended in June. In my new happiness with Laura (to whom we never mentioned the Count's name), I was sometimes tempted to change my mind and to leave things as they were. But she still had dreams, terrible dreams that made her cry out in her sleep, and I knew I had to go on.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两个星期之后，我们回到了伦敦。我开始准备与伯爵的较量。现在是5月初，他租房的期限到6月。享受着与劳拉新婚的幸福（我们从未跟她提起过伯爵），有时我忍不住想改变主意，让一切都过去。但是劳拉仍会做梦，可怕的噩梦，她常常在梦里惊叫起来，因此我明白必须继续原来的计划。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">First, I tried to find out more about the Count. Marian told me that he had not been back to Italy for many years. Had he been obliged to leave Italy for political reasons, I wondered? But Marian also said that at Blackwater Park he had received official-looking letters with Italian stamps on, which would seem to contradict this idea. Perhaps he was a spy, I thought. That might explain why he had stayed in England so long after the successful completion of his plot. Who could I ask who might know something? Another Italian, perhaps -- and I suddenly thought of my old friend, Professor Pesca.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="首先，我想尽量多了解一些伯爵的事。玛丽安告诉我，他已经很多年没有回意大利了。我想，他是不是由于政治原因被迫离开意大利的呢？但是玛丽安又说，在布莱克沃特庄园他好像收到过贴着意大利邮票的官方来信，这两者是互相矛盾的。也许他是间谍。这样可以解释为什么他在自己的阴谋得逞后，还在英国逗留那么久。有谁能告诉我答案呢？也许该再找个意大利人问问——猛然间我想到了老朋友，佩斯卡教授。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Near Oxford Street he stopped to read a sign announcing an opera, and then went into the opera ticket office, which was nearby. I went over to read the sign. The opera was being performed that evening, and it seemed likely that the Count would be in the audience.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在牛津街附近，他停住脚步看一个歌剧的海报，然后走进了不远处的售票处。我过去看了一下海报，发现演出就在晚上，伯爵很可能会出现在观众当中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">If I invite Pesca to the opera, I thought, I can point the Count out to him and find out if he knows him. So I bought two tickets myself, sent Pesca a note, and that evening called to take him with me to the opera.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我想假如邀请佩斯卡来看歌剧，就可以把伯爵指给他，看他是否认识。于是，我自己买了两张票，给佩斯卡写了封短信，晚上找他一起去看歌剧。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Before I did that, I decided to have a look at the Count, as up to this time I had never once set eyes on him. So one morning I went to Forest Road, St John's Wood, and waited near his house. Eventually, he came out and I followed behind him as he walked towards the centre of London. Marian had prepared me for his enormous size and fashionable clothes, but not for the horrible freshness and cheerfulness and energy of the man.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="去见佩斯卡教授前，我决定先去看一下伯爵，因为到目前为止，我还从来没有见过他。于是一天早上，我去了圣约翰伍德的弗雷斯特大街，在他的住处附近等他出现。最后，他终于出来了，朝伦敦市中心走去。我在后面跟着他。玛丽安跟我提过他身躯肥胖，衣着入时，但我没想到这个人那么精力旺盛，神采飞扬。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The music had already started when we went in, and all the seats were filled. However, there was room to stand at the sides. I looked around and saw the Count sitting in a seat half-way down, so I placed myself exactly on a line with him, with Pesca standing at my side. When the first part finished, the audience, including the Count, rose to look about them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们进入剧院的时候，音乐已经响起来了，剧场里座无虚席。不过剧场两边还有站的地方。我环顾四周，看到伯爵坐在前面几排的座位上，于是我也站到了那一排，佩斯卡站在我旁边。第一部分演出结束了，观众们，包括伯爵在内，都起身向周围张望。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As Pesca looked away, the Count turned, moving quickly towards the back of the theatre, where the crowd was thickest. I caught Pesca's arm and, to his great surprise, hurried him with me after the Count. The slim man with the scar had apparently also decided to leave, and was already ahead of us. By the time Pesca and I reached the entrance, neither the Count nor the slim man was in sight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="佩斯卡扭头的时候，伯爵转身快步向剧场后边走去，那里人最多。我一把抓住佩斯卡的胳膊，不顾他的惊讶，拉着他紧追伯爵。那个脸上有疤的瘦子显然也准备离开剧场，并且已经走到了我们的前面。等我和佩斯卡赶到入口，伯爵和那个瘦子都已经不见了。">查看中文翻译</div>

Two, you wait here until my agent comes early tomorrow morning and you give him an order to get back your letter unopened. You then allow us half an hour to leave the house.

<div class="line_en">At once, he called for coffee and sat down to write. He wrote quickly for quite some time. Finally, he jumped up, declared that he had finished and read out his statement, which I accepted as satisfactory. He gave me the address of the company from whom he had hired the cab to collect Laura, and also gave me a letter signed by Sir Percival. It was dated 25th July, and announced the journey of Lady Glyde to London on 26th July. So there it was. On 25th July, the date of her death certificate in London, Laura was alive in Hampshire, about to make a journey the next day.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the summer of 1850 I arrived in England on delicate political business and stayed with my friend, Sir Percival Glyde. We both urgently needed large amounts of money. The only person who had such money was his wife, from whom not a penny could be obtained until her death. To make matters worse, my friend had other private problems. A woman called Anne Catherick was hidden in the neighbourhood, was communicating with Lady Glyde, and knew a secret which could ruin him. And if he was ruined, what would happen to our financial interests?</div>

<div class="line_en">Next, we sent Mrs Michelson away for a few days, and one night Madame Fosco, Mrs Rubelle and I moved the sleeping Miss Halcombe to an unused part of the house. I left for London in the morning with my wife, leaving Sir Percival to persuade Lady Glyde that her sister had gone to Limmeridge and that she should follow her, breaking her journey in London at my house.</div>

<div class="line_en">The first thing to do was to find Anne Catherick, who, I was told, looked very much like Lady Glyde and who had escaped from a mad-house. I had the fantastic idea of changing the names, places and lives of Lady Glyde and Anne Catherick, the one with the other. The wonderful results of this change would be the gain of £ 30,000 and the keeping of Sir Percival's secret.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们要做的第一件事就是找到安妮·凯瑟里克。我了解到她的长相和格莱德夫人极为相似。她是从精神病院逃出来的。我突发奇想，把格莱德夫人同安妮·凯瑟里克的名字、住处、经历互换一下。互换的结果既可以让我们得到3万英镑，又能够保住珀西瓦尔爵士的秘密。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I found Anne Catherick and persuaded her and her friend to return to London. I rented a house in St John's Wood for myself, and obtained from Mr Fairlie in Limmeridge an invitation for Lady Glyde to visit. For my plan to work, it was necessary for Lady Glyde to leave Blackwater Park alone and stay a night at my house on her way to Limmeridge. This plan was made easier by Miss Halcombe's illness. I returned to Blackwater Park, and when Miss Halcombe was out of danger, I got rid of the doctor and instructed Sir Percival to get rid of the servants.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was too late to change the plan. I remained calm and carried on. On the 26th, leaving the false Lady Glyde dead in my house, I collected the true Lady Glyde from the railway station and took her to Mrs Rubelle's house. The two medical men I had hired (shall we say) were easily persuaded to certify the confused and frightened Lady Glyde as mentally ill. Then I gave her a drug and had Mrs Rubelle dress her in Anne Catherick's clothes. The next day, the 27th, she was delivered to the asylum, where she was received with great surprise, but without suspicion. The false Lady Glyde was buried at Limmeridge. I attended the funeral with suitable expressions of deep sympathy.</div>
