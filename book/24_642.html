<div class="line_en">In the darkness of the subtropical night, George Greggson swam slowly upwards towards consciousness. He did not know what had awakened him, and for a moment he lay in a puzzled stupor. Then he realized that he was alone. Jean had got up and gone silently into the nursery. She was talking quietly to Jeff, too quietly for him to hear what she was saying.</div>

<div class="line_en">The only light in the nursery came from the fluoro-paint patterns on the walls. By their dim glow, George could see Jean sitting beside Jeff's bed. She turned as he came in, and whispered, "Don't disturb the Poppet."</div>

<div class="line_en">George tousled his son's untidy hair with one hand, while tightening his dressing-gown around him with the other. He felt suddenly very cold and very small.

<div class="line_en">"Yes," Rashaverak answered. "It is undoubtedly Alphanidon 2. The Sulphur Mountains confirm the fact. And it's interesting to notice the distortion of the time scale. The planet rotates fairly slowly, so he must have observed many hours in a few minutes."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="乔治觉得这样已经够幸运了，心里还是忍不住担心。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">To Jeff it was only a game: it had not yet begun to frighten him. A dream was merely a dream, no matter how strange it might be. He was no longer lonely in the worlds that sleep opened up to him. Only on that first night had his mind called out to Jean across whatever unknown gulfs had sundered them. Now he went alone and fearless into the universe that was opening up before him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杰弗自己一点也不害怕，这样的梦就像一场游戏，不管多奇怪，终究只是梦。除了第一次，他越过那些不知名的海湾后感到孤独，呼唤过妈妈，以后的梦里就再也没有孤独的感觉，他一个人可以大无畏地在梦的世界里闯荡。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the mornings they would question him, and he would tell what he could remember. Sometimes his words stumbled and failed as he tried to describe scenes which were clearly not only beyond all his experience, but beyond the imagination of Man. They would prompt him with new words, show him pictures and colours to refresh his memory, then build up what pattern they could from his replies. Often they could make nothing of the result, though it seemed that in Jeff's own mind his dream worlds were perfectly plain and sharp. He was simply unable to communicate them to his parents. Yet some were clear enough… Space -- no planet, no surrounding landscape, no world underfoot. Only the stars in the velvet night, and hanging against them a great red sun that was beating like a heart.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="早上醒来，父母会问他一些问题，他会回忆梦中的故事，有时，描绘的场景他自己从来没有见过，人们也无法想象，他结结巴巴，讲不清楚，这时他们就会启发他，给他一些图画、颜色提醒他，想弄明白到底怎么回事，但通常还是弄不明白。在杰弗的脑海中，梦中的世界是清晰、鲜明的，他只是无法讲清楚。但他的讲述中至少还有一部分是清楚的。">查看中文翻译</div>

It would climb the spectrum and hover at the edge of yellow, and the cycle would reverse itself, the, star would expand and cool, becoming once more a ragged, flame-red cloud… ("Typical pulsating variable," said Rashaverak eagerly.

<div class="line_en">It might have been Earth. A white sun hung in a blue sky flecked with clouds, which were racing before a storm. A bill sloped gently down to an ocean torn into spray by the ravening wind. Yet nothing moved: the scene was frozen as if glimpsed in a flash of lightning. And far, far away on the horizon was something that was not of Earth -- a line of misty columns, tapering slightly as they soared out of the sea and lost themselves among the clouds. They were spaced with perfect precision along the rim of the planet -- too huge to be artificial, yet too regular to be natural.</div>

<div class="line_en">Jennifer Anne Greggson, lately known as the Poppet, lay on her back with her eyes tightly closed. She had not opened them for a long time; she would never open them again, for sight was now as superfluous to her as to the many-sensed creatures of the lightless ocean deeps. She was aware of the world that surrounded her: indeed, she was aware of much more than that.</div>

<div class="line_en">One reflex remained from her brief babyhood, by some unaccountable trick of development. The rattle which had once delighted her sounded incessantly now, beating a complex, ever-changing rhythm in her cot.

It simply happens to be the first. Any other neutron would have served -- just as Jeffrey might have been anybody in the world. We call it Total Breakthrough. There is no need for any secrecy now, and I am very glad. We have been waiting for this to happen, ever since we came to Earth.

<div class="line_en">"But there is one analogy which is -- well, suggestive and helpful. It occurs over and over again in your literature. Imagine that every man's mind is an island, surrounded by ocean. Each seems isolated, yet in reality all are linked by the bedrock from which they spring. If the oceans were to vanish, that would be the end of the islands. They would all be part of one continent, but their individuality would have gone.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Telepathy, as you have called it, is something like this. In suitable circumstances minds can merge and share each other's contents, and carry back memories of the experience when they are isolated once more.

It was an unbelievable pattern, but it had its own inherent logic.
