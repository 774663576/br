<div class="line_en">It was late in the evening when Philip arrived at Ferne. It was Mrs. Athelny's native village, and she had been accustomed from her childhood to pick in the hop-field to which with her husband and her children she still went every year. Like many Kentish folk her family had gone out regularly, glad to earn a little money, but especially regarding the annual outing, looked forward to for months, as the best of holidays. The work was not hard, it was done in common, in the open air, and for the children it was a long, delightful picnic; here the young men met the maidens; in the long evenings when work was over they wandered about the lanes, making love; and the hopping season was generally followed by weddings. They went out in carts with bedding, pots and pans, chairs and tables; and Ferne while the hopping lasted was deserted. They were very exclusive and would have resented the intrusion of foreigners, as they called the people who came from London; they looked down upon them and feared them too; they were a rough lot, and the respectable country folk did not want to mix with them. In the old days the hoppers slept in barns, but ten years ago a row of huts had been erected at the side of a meadow; and the Athelnys, like many others, had the same hut every year.</div>

<div class="line_en">Athelny met Philip at the station in a cart he had borrowed from the public-house at which he had got a room for Philip. It was a quarter of a mile from the hop-field. They left his bag there and walked over to the meadow in which were the huts. They were nothing more than a long, low shed, divided into little rooms about twelve feet square. In front of each was a fire of sticks, round which a family was grouped, eagerly watching the cooking of supper. The sea-air and the sun had browned already the faces of Athelny's children. Mrs. Athelny seemed a different woman in her sun-bonnet: you felt that the long years in the city had made no real difference to her; she was the country woman born and bred, and you could see how much at home she found herself in the country. She was frying bacon and at the same time keeping an eye on the younger children, but she had a hearty handshake and a jolly smile for Philip. Athelny was enthusiastic over the delights of a rural existence.</div>

<div class="line_en">She stepped out of their little hut, and the flames of the wood fire leaped up and cast sharp colour upon her face. Of late Philip had only seen her in the trim frocks she had taken to since she was at the dressmaker's, and there was something very charming in the print dress she wore now, loose and easy to work in; the sleeves were tucked up and showed her strong, round arms.

She was like some rural goddess, and you thought of those fresh, strong girls whom old Herrick had praised in exquisite numbers. The supper was simple, bread and butter, crisp bacon, tea for the children, and beer for Mr. and Mrs. Athelny and Philip. Athelny, eating hungrily, praised loudly all he ate. He flung words of scorn at Lucullus and piled invectives upon Brillat-Savarin.</div>

<div class="line_en">Small hands seized Philip, and he was dragged towards the hut. He went in and struck a match.

<div class="line_en">The beds consisted of a thick layer of hopvine, on the top of which was a coating of straw, and this was covered with a blanket. After a day in the open air, with the aromatic scent of the hops all round them, the happy pickers slept like tops. By nine o'clock all was quiet in the meadow and everyone in bed but one or two men who still lingered in the public-house and would not come back till it was closed at ten.

<div class="line_en">Jane and Harold and Edward shouted with delight at the prospect, and next morning Philip was awakened out of a sound sleep by their bursting into his room. The boys jumped on his bed, and he had to chase them out with his slippers. He put on a coat and a pair of trousers and went down. The day had only just broken, and there was a nip in the air; but the sky was cloudless, and the sun was shining yellow. Sally, holding Connie's hand, was standing in the middle of the road, with a towel and a bathing-dress over her arm. He saw now that her sun-bonnet was of the colour of lavender, and against it her face, red and brown, was like an apple. She greeted him with her slow, sweet smile, and he noticed suddenly that her teeth were small and regular and very white. He wondered why they had never caught his attention before.</div>

<div class="line_en">They walked down the road and then cut across the marshes. That way it was under a mile to the sea. The water looked cold and gray, and Philip shivered at the sight of it; but the others tore off their clothes and ran in shouting. Sally did everything a little slowly, and she did not come into the water till all the rest were splashing round Philip. Swimming was his only accomplishment; he felt at home in the water; and soon he had them all imitating him as he played at being a porpoise, and a drowning man, and a fat lady afraid of wetting her hair. The bathe was uproarious, and it was necessary for Sally to be very severe to induce them all to come out.</div>

<div class="line_en">They walked back, Sally with her bright hair streaming over one shoulder and her sun-bonnet in her hand, but when they got to the huts Mrs. Athelny had already started for the hop-garden. Athleny, in a pair of the oldest trousers anyone had ever worn, his jacket buttoned up to show he had no shirt on, and in a wide-brimmed soft hat, was frying kippers over a fire of sticks. He was delighted with himself: he looked every inch a brigand. As soon as he saw the party he began to shout the witches' chorus from Macbeth over the odorous kippers.</div>

<div class="line_en">And in a few minutes, Harold and Jane with pieces of bread and butter in their hands, they sauntered through the meadow into the hop-field. They were the last to leave. A hop-garden was one of the sights connected with Philip's boyhood and the oast-houses to him the most typical feature of the Kentish scene. It was with no sense of strangeness, but as though he were at home, that Philip followed Sally through the long lines of the hops. The sun was bright now and cast a sharp shadow. Philip feasted his eyes on the richness of the green leaves. The hops were yellowing, and to him they had the beauty and the passion which poets in Sicily have found in the purple grape. As they walked along Philip felt himself overwhelmed by the rich luxuriance. A sweet scent arose from the fat Kentish soil, and the fitful September breeze was heavy with the goodly perfume of the hops. Athelstan felt the exhilaration instinctively, for he lifted up his voice and sang; it was the cracked voice of the boy of fifteen, and Sally turned round.</div>

<div class="line_en">In a moment they heard the hum of voices, and in a moment more came upon the pickers. They were all hard at work, talking and laughing as they picked. They sat on chairs, on stools, on boxes, with their baskets by their sides, and some stood by the bin throwing the hops they picked straight into it. There were a lot of children about and a good many babies, some in makeshift cradles, some tucked up in a rug on the soft brown dry earth. The children picked a little and played a great deal. The women worked busily, they had been pickers from childhood, and they could pick twice as fast as foreigners from London. They boasted about the number of bushels they had picked in a day, but they complained you could not make money now as in former times: then they paid you a shilling for five bushels, but now the rate was eight and even nine bushels to the shilling. In the old days a good picker could earn enough in the season to keep her for the rest of the year, but now there was nothing in it; you got a holiday for nothing, and that was about all. Mrs. Hill had bought herself a pianner out of what she made picking, so she said, but she was very near, one wouldn't like to be near like that, and most people thought it was only what she said, if the truth was known perhaps it would be found that she had put a bit of money from the savings bank towards it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没过多久，一阵嘈杂的声音渐渐响起。很快，其他忙着采摘的人都开始躁动起来。他们手底下一刻也不松懈，一边采着啤酒花一边和其他人说说笑笑。有的搬来了椅子、凳子，有些直接坐在箱子上，有些身边放着篮子，有些站在箱子旁边，采下的啤酒花就直接扔到箱子里。除了大人，这里还有不少小孩。他们光顾着玩耍，忘了要干活。婴儿躺在临时摇篮，或是裹在毯子里放在干燥柔软的褐色土地上。土生土长的肯特郡女人干活麻利，采摘起来比从伦敦来的人要快两倍。她们吹嘘自己一天能摘好几蒲式耳的啤酒花，却抱怨现在啤酒花没有过去那么值钱了。曾经五蒲式耳就能卖一先令，现在要八蒲式耳甚至更多才行。过去一个熟练的采摘工一季挣的钱足够花到年尾，但现在却挣不回几个子儿，一个假期什么也赚不回来。希尔夫人说自己曾靠卖啤酒花的钱买了架钢琴。可她的生活实在太拮据了，谁也不愿像她那样寒酸地过日子。况且大多数人都觉得她只是自己这么说说罢了，反正谁也不知道事情的真相，也许她从银行里又取了点钱呢。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Quite right, my boy," answered Athelny, with a wave of the hand, as he strolled away. "No work, no dinner."</div>

<div class="line_en">The hoppers were divided into bin companies of ten pickers, not counting children, and Athelny loudly boasted of the day when he would have a company consisting entirely of his own family. Each company had a bin-man, whose duty it was to supply it with strings of hops at their bins (the bin was a large sack on a wooden frame, about seven feet high, and long rows of them were placed between the rows of hops;) and it was to this position that Athelny aspired when his family was old enough to form a company. Meanwhile he worked rather by encouraging others than by exertions of his own. He sauntered up to Mrs. Athelny, who had been busy for half an hour and had already emptied a basket into the bin, and with his cigarette between his lips began to pick. He asserted that he was going to pick more than anyone that day, but mother; of course no one could pick so much as mother; that reminded him of the trials which Aphrodite put upon the curious Psyche, and he began to tell his children the story of her love for the unseen bridegroom. He told it very well. It seemed to Philip, listening with a smile on his lips, that the old tale fitted in with the scene. The sky was very blue now, and he thought it could not be more lovely even in Greece. The children with their fair hair and rosy cheeks, strong, healthy, and vivacious; the delicate form of the hops; the challenging emerald of the leaves, like a blare of trumpets; the magic of the green alley, narrowing to a point as you looked down the row, with the pickers in their sun-bonnets: perhaps there was more of the Greek spirit there than you could find in the books of professors or in museums. He was thankful for the beauty of England. He thought of the winding white roads and the hedgerows, the green meadows with their elm-trees, the delicate line of the hills and the copses that crowned them, the flatness of the marshes, and the melancholy of the North Sea. He was very glad that he felt its loveliness. But presently Athelny grew restless and announced that he would go and ask how Robert Kemp's mother was. He knew everyone in the garden and called them all by their Christian names; he knew their family histories and all that had happened to them from birth. With harmless vanity he played the fine gentleman among them, and there was a touch of condescension in his familiarity. Philip would not go with him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所有采摘者分成几个小组，每组十个人共用一个箱子，孩子不算在内。阿西尔尼吹嘘道，自己一家都够组成一个小组了。每个组里有一人专门守在箱子跟前，负责把箱里的啤酒花编成串（所谓的箱子不过是木框撑起来的麻布袋，大概有七英尺高，摆成长长一排放在田垄中间）。阿西尔尼早就眼红这个职位，等家里的孩子都长大了，他肯定会霸占这个位子，打发孩子去干活。阿西尔尼的任务似乎不是自己出力，而是跑来跑去给别人鼓劲。他嘴里叼着烟，走到已经忙了半个钟头、采满一篮啤酒花的妻子身边，装模作样地采摘起来。他宣称今天要摘得比谁都多——当然比不上妈妈啦，谁也不可能比妈妈摘得多。他忽然想起阿弗洛狄忒故意刁难普赛克的故事，便跟孩子们讲起普赛克和她那位看不见的新郎。他讲得活灵活现、栩栩如生。菲利普面含笑意静静听着，似乎也觉得这个古老的神话和现在的情景契合极了。瓦蓝的天空明净如洗，就算在希腊怕是也见不着如此美丽的景色。这群头发浓密、脸蛋红润的孩子健康、强壮、活蹦乱跳。娇嫩的啤酒花、如绿宝石般晶莹的叶子像吹响的号角。鲜绿的花垄排排向远处延伸，直到缩成一个小点，戴着遮阳帽的人穿梭其中，忙忙碌碌。这样的景色也许比书本或者博物馆更能体现出希腊精神吧。菲利普对英格兰的美景心怀感激。他想到弯弯曲曲的白色小径，郁郁葱葱的灌木篱墙，绿色的草地上榆树拔地而起，远处山峦起伏，线条优美。山顶是茂密的树丛，山脚是平坦的沼泽。那一片北海的水，忧郁凄清，潮起潮落。菲利普为自己能感受到自然之美而兴奋。这会儿，阿西尔尼坐不住了，他说要去和罗伯特·坎普的母亲打个招呼。这里的人没有他不认识的。他亲昵地直呼他们的教名，知道每个家庭的过往，还有打他们出生以来发生过的所有事。出于一种不含恶意的虚荣，阿西尔尼在这群人里一直扮演着善良绅士的角色。虽然他对谁都很亲密，但却隐隐有种自视甚高的倨傲感。菲利普不想和他一起去。">查看中文翻译</div>
