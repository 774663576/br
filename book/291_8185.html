<div class="line_en">As soon as he gets home, Geppetto fashions the Marionette and calls it Pinocchio. The first pranks of the Marionette Little as Geppetto's house was, it was neat and comfortable. It was a small room on the ground floor, with a tiny window under the stairway. The furniture could not have been much simpler: a very old chair, a rickety old bed, and a tumble-down table. A fireplace full of burning logs was painted on the wall opposite the door. Over the fire, there was painted a pot full of something which kept boiling happily away and sending up clouds of what looked like real steam.</div>

<div class="line_en">After choosing the name for his Marionette, Geppetto set seriously to work to make the hair, the forehead, the eyes. Fancy his surprise when he noticed that these eyes moved and then stared fixedly at him. Geppetto, seeing this, felt insulted and said in a grieved tone:</div>

If we leave that poor Marionette in his hands he may tear him to pieces!"They said so much that, finally, the Carabineer ended matters by setting Pinocchio at liberty and dragging Geppetto to prison. The poor old fellow did not know how to defend himself, but wept and wailed like a child and said between his sobs:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="又有人不怀好意地接上去说：“杰佩托这家伙，看着挺老实，对孩子可真凶！让这个可怜木偶落到他手里，他准把木偶剁成碎木片！…”一句话，他们这么东一锤西一棒的，那位警察竟把皮诺乔放开，反倒把可怜的杰佩托送到监狱里去了。”他一路上监狱，一路结结巴巴地哭着说：">查看中文翻译</div>
