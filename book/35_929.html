<div class="line_en">The cooper's hut appeared to be built inside a deep ditch, its thatch roof so close to the earth that Edwin, lowering his head to pass under it, felt he was climbing into a hole. So he had been prepared for the darkness, but the stifling warmth -- and the thick woodsmoke -- took him aback, and he announced his arrival with a fit of coughing.</div>

<div class="line_en">The warrior carefully brought both feet to the earth floor, reached down and tossed a log onto the flames. Edwin saw then how his left arm was bound tightly in sacking, and that one side of his face had a spreading bruise that partially closed one eye.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="武士小心翼翼地把双脚挪到泥土地面上，弯下腰来，朝火里扔了一根木柴。埃德温发现，他左臂上紧紧地缠着绷带，一边脸上有一大片瘀伤，一只眼睛几乎没法睁开。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"True," Wistan said, "when I first looked down from the top of that burning tower and the wagon we so carefully prepared wasn't there, I'd a mind to curse you. A long fall to stony ground and hot smoke already around me. Listening to the agonies of my enemies below, I asked, do I mingle with them even as we become ash together? Or better be smashed alone under the night sky? Yet before I could find an answer, the wagon arrived after all, tugged by my own mare, a monk pulling her bridle. I hardly asked if this monk was friend or foe, but leapt from that chimney mouth, and our earlier work was well enough done, comrade, for though I plunged through the hay as if it were water, I met nothing to pierce me. I awoke on a table, gentle monks loyal to Father Jonus attending me all around as if I was their supper. The fever must already have taken hold by then, whether from these wounds or from the great heat, for they say they had to muffle my ravings till they brought me down here out of harm's way. But if the gods favour us, the fever will pass soon and we'll set off to finish our errand."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没错，”维斯坦说，“当时我从熊熊燃烧的塔顶往下看，我们精心准备的推车却不在那儿，我的确想骂你。从高塔上跳下，摔到石头地上？我已经被热浪裹住了。我听着下面敌人痛苦的叫声，我问自己，就算我们一起化为灰烬，我们能合得来吗？在夜空下独自摔下去，是不是更好？但是，我还没拿定主意，那辆车竟然来了，是我自己的马拉来的，由一名僧侣牵着缰绳。我不去管这名僧侣是敌是友，立即从烟囱口上跳了下去。我们之前的工作做得很好，我的战友，我整个人都扎了进去，好像车上的干草是水一样，但草里并没有什么东西把我刺穿。醒来的时候，我躺在餐桌上，对乔纳斯神父忠心耿耿的一些僧侣在周围照顾我，好像我是他们的晚餐一样。那时候，我肯定烧发得很厉害了，不知道是因为受了伤，还是因为被火烤的，他们说只好把我嘴巴堵住，以免我胡言乱语，然后把我送到山下安全的地方。但是，如果众神眷顾，这烧很快就会过去，那我们就出发，完成我们的任务。”">查看中文翻译</div>

You've remarkable spirit right enough, and if we survive this errand, I'll see you learn the skills to make you a true warrior. But just now you're rough-hewn, not yet a blade.

<div class="line_en">Even as he said this, the scenes were rapidly filling his mind: how he would enter their camp, startling them as they sat silently in their semi-circle to watch his mother trying to free herself. They would be full-grown men by now; most likely bearded and heavy-bellied, no longer the lithe young men who had come swaggering into their village that day. Burly, coarse men, and as they reached for their axes, they would see the warrior following behind Edwin and fear would enter their eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他说这话的时候，脑海中快速闪过一幕幕场景：那些人围成半圆静静地坐着，看着他母亲试图挣脱束缚，他走进营地，让那些人大吃一惊。这时候他们都该是成年人了，很可能留着胡子、腆着肚子，再也不是那天大摇大摆走进村庄的那群身材挺拔的小青年了。都是壮实、粗鄙的男人，他们伸手去拿斧头，看到埃德温身后跟着的武士，眼睛里会流露出恐惧。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But how could he deceive the warrior -- his teacher and the man he admired above all others? And here was Wistan nodding with satisfaction, saying: "I knew it as soon as I saw you, Master Edwin. Even as I released you from those ogres by the river." He would enter their camp. He would free his mother. The burly men would be killed, or perhaps be allowed to flee into the mountain fog. And then what? Edwin would have to explain why, even as they were hurrying to complete an urgent errand, he had chosen to deceive the warrior.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可他怎么能欺骗武士呢？这是他的老师，又是他最崇拜的人。而维斯坦却点着头，满意地说：“我一见到你就知道啦，埃德温阁下。在河边把你从食人兽那儿救回来的时候就知道了。”他将进入他们的营地。他将释放母亲。那些壮实的男人将被杀掉，或许会让他们逃入山间的雾霭之中。然后呢？他们要匆忙赶去完成一项紧急任务，同时埃德温必须解释，他为什么要欺骗武士。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“问吧，小战友。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm wondering, warrior. Is there some special feud between you and Lord Brennus makes you stay and fight his soldiers when we might have fled the monastery and be half a day closer to Querig? It must be some mighty reason to make you put aside even your errand."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我在寻思啊，武士，本来我们可以逃离修道院，早半天去找魁瑞格的，你和布雷纳斯爵爷之间是不是有什么特别的仇恨，所以你才留下来与他的士兵战斗？你连任务都暂时放到一边，肯定有什么重要的理由吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The silence that followed was so long Edwin thought the warrior had passed out in the stifling air. But then there was the knee still moving slowly, and when the voice eventually came out of the darkness, the slight tremor of the fever seemed to have evaporated.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接下来的沉默很长，以至于埃德温以为，武士在令人窒息的空气中晕过去了。但是，那只膝盖仍旧在缓缓晃动，当他的声音终于从黑暗中传来时，发烧引起的微微颤抖似乎已经消失了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I've no excuse, young comrade. I can only confess my folly, and that after the good father's warning not to forget my duty! See how weak is the resolve of your master. Yet I'm a warrior before all else, and it's no easy thing to flee a battle I know I can win. You're right, we could even now be standing at the she-dragon's den, calling her to come greet us. But Brennus I knew it to be, even a hope he'd come in person, and it was more than I could do not to stay and welcome them."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我没有借口，小战友。我只能承认自己很傻，而且好心的神父还刚提醒过我不要忘记职责呢！你看，你师傅的意志力多么脆弱。不过，我首先是一名武士，面对战斗，如果我明知道能够打赢，要我逃走可不容易。你说得对，说不定我们本可以现在就站在母龙的巢穴旁，喊她出来迎接。但我知道他们是布雷纳斯的人，也许他自己还会来，不留下来与他们会面，我可做不到。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No feud worth the name. We knew each other as boys, as young as you are now. This was in a country further west of here, in a well-guarded fort where we boys, twenty or more, were trained morning till night to become warriors in the Britons' ranks. I grew to feel great affection for my companions of those days, for they were splendid fellows and we lived like brothers. All except Brennus, that is, for being the lord's son, he loathed to mix with us. Yet he often trained with us, and though his skills were feeble, whenever one of us faced him with a wooden sword, or at wrestling in the sandpit, we had to let him win. Anything short of glorious victory for the lord's son would result in punishments for us all. Can you imagine it, young comrade? To be proud young boys, as we were, and have such an inferior opponent appear to conquer us day after day? Worse, Brennus delighted in heaping humiliations on his opponents even as we feigned defeat. It pleased him to stand on our necks, or to kick us as we lay for him on the ground. Imagine how this felt to us, comrade!"</div>

Perhaps because even then my skills stood out, he delighted to choose me as his sparring opponent, and reserved his greatest humiliations for me. And he was not slow to notice I was a Saxon boy, and before long, turned each of my companions against me on that account. Even those once closest to me joined against me, spitting in my food, or hiding my clothes as we hurried to our training on a harsh winter's morning, fearful of our teachers' wrath. It was a great lesson Brennus taught me then, and when I understood how I shamed myself loving Britons as my brothers, I made up my mind to leave that fort, even with no friend or kin beyond those walls."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Judge for me if I did or not, comrade, for I'm undecided on the question. The custom in that fort was for us apprentices, after our day's training, to be allowed an hour after supper to idle away together. We'd build a fire in the yard and sit around it talking and jesting the way boys will. Brennus never joined us, of course, for he had his privileged quarters, but on that evening, for whatever reason, I saw him walk past. I moved away from the rest then, my companions suspecting nothing. Now that fort, like any other, had many hidden passages, all of which I knew well, so that before long I was in an unwatched corner where the battlements cast black shadows over the ground. Brennus came strolling my way, alone, and when I moved from the gloom he stopped and looked at me with terror. For he saw at once this could be no chance encounter, and further, that his usual powers were suspended. It was curious, Master Edwin, to see this swaggering lord turned so swiftly to an infant ready to make water before me for fear. I was sorely tempted to say to him, 'Good sir, I see your sword on your hip. Knowing how much more skilfully you wield it, you'll have no fear drawing it against mine.' Yet I said no such thing, for had I hurt him in that dark corner, what of my dreams of a life beyond those walls? I said nothing, but remained before him in silence, letting the moment grow long between us, for I wished it to be one never forgotten. And though he cowered back and would have cried for help had not some remnant of pride told him to do so would ensure his abiding humiliation, we neither of us spoke to the other. Then in time I left him, and so you see, Master Edwin, nothing and yet everything had passed between us. I knew then I'd do well to leave that very night, and since these were no longer times of war, the watch wasn't strict. I slipped quietly past the guards, saying no farewells, and was soon a boy under the moonlight, my dear companions left behind, my own kin long slaughtered, nothing but my courage and lately learned skills to carry on my journey."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我的战友，你来判断一下，我这算不算报了仇，我自己还没拿定主意呢。根据要塞的规定，我们这些学徒一天训练结束，晚饭后有一个小时的时间，可以自由活动。我们会在院子里生个火，围坐在周围，像其他男孩子一样聊天、开玩笑。当然，布雷纳斯不和我们一起，他有专门的地方，但是那天晚上，我看见他从一旁走过，不知道是干什么。我起身离开人群，伙伴们并没有生疑。和别的要塞一样，那儿也有很多秘密通道，我都很熟悉。不久，我来到一个没人守卫的角落，城垛的黑影落在地面上。布雷纳斯优哉游哉朝我这边走来，一个人，我从黑暗中现身，他停下脚步，惊恐地看着我。他立即明白，这绝不是偶然碰上，而且他平日里的力量都失效了。真是奇怪的事啊，埃德温阁下，这位平时趾高气扬的爵爷，一下子变成了婴儿，在我面前害怕得简直要尿裤子。我真想跟他说：‘我的爵爷，我看到你的剑背在身后。你知道你的剑术比我们高明得多，拔出剑来和我比一比，你肯定不会胆怯吧。’但我没说这种话，因为如果我在那个黑暗的角落里伤了他，那我还能逃出要塞开始新的生活吗？我什么都没说，就默默地站在他身前，让时间在我们两人之间慢慢过去，因为我希望这一刻永生难忘。他往后退缩，之所以没有大喊救命，是因为残存的一点儿自尊告诉他，如果喊出来，那肯定一辈子都得忍受羞辱。我们都没有跟对方说话。等时间差不多了，我就走了，你看，埃德温阁下，我们之间没发生什么事，也可以说什么都发生了。我知道，我当天晚上就应该离开了，那不是战争时期，守卫并不严。我悄悄避开卫兵们，也没跟人告别，很快我就来到了外面的月光之下，孤零零一个少年，离开了我亲爱的伙伴们，我的亲人们很久以前就被杀了，只有依靠自己的勇气和新近学到的本领才能继续走下去。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So he had failed to hide his restlessness, but surely Wistan could not suspect his deception. Was it possible the warrior too could hear his mother's voice? She had been calling all the while the warrior had been speaking. "Will you not find the strength for me, Edwin? Are you too young after all? Will you not come to me, Edwin? Did you not promise me that day you would?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"Who knows what demons whisper in that fool's ear? A great lord now, in this country and the next, yet he lives in dread of any Saxon traveller from the east passing through his lands. Has he fed the fear of that night again and again that it now sits in his belly a giant worm? Or is it the she-dragon's breath makes him forget whatever cause he once had to fear me, yet the dread grows all the more monstrous for being unnamed? Only last year a Saxon warrior from the fens, one I knew well, was killed as he travelled in peace through this very country. Yet I remain indebted to Lord Brennus for the lesson he taught me, for without it I might even now be counting Britons as my brother warriors. What troubles you, young comrade? You shift from foot to foot as if my fever possesses you also."</div>
