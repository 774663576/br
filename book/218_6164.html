<div class="line_en">The arrows in the diagrams represent the flow of cash, or "cash flow." Numbers alone really mean little. Just as words alone mean little. It's the story that counts. In financial reporting, reading numbers is looking for the plot, the story. The story of where the cash is flowing. In 80 percent of most families, the financial story is a story of working hard in an effort to get ahead. Not because they don't make money. But because they spend their lives buying liabilities instead of assets.</div>

<div class="line_en">Illiteracy, both in words and numbers, is the foundation of financial struggle. If people are having difficulties financially, there is something that they cannot read, either in numbers or words. Something is misunderstood.

So if you want to be rich and maintain your wealth, it's important to be financially literate, in words as well as numbers.</div>

<div class="line_en">But more money will often not solve the problem; in fact, it may actually accelerate the problem. Money often makes obvious our tragic human flaws. Money often puts a spotlight on what we do not know. That is why, all too often, a person who comes into a sudden windfall of cash -- let's say an inheritance, a pay raise or lottery winnings -- soon returns to the same financial mess, if not worse than the mess they were in before they received the money. Money only accentuates the cash flow pattern running in your head. If your pattern is to spend everything you get, most likely an increase in cash will just result in an increase in spending. Thus, the saying, "A fool and his money is one big party,"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但更多的钱往往不能解决问题，实际上它可能使问题变得更加严重。钱常常使我们人性中的弱点显露，钱不能掩盖我们的无知。这就是为什么经常有些人在忽然得到一大笔意外之财，比如遗产、加薪或中彩之后，却又很快失去的原因——甚至有些人会比他得到那些钱之前的财务状况更糟。钱只是使你头脑中的现金流向图的流向更加明显，如果你的现金流向图是把收入都花掉，那么最可能的结果是增加了收入的同时也增加了支出。正所谓：“钱愚弄人”。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I have said many times that we go to school to gain scholastic skills and professional skills, both important. We learn to make money with our professional skills. In the 1960s, when I was in high school, if someone did well in school academically, almost immediately people assumed this bright student would go on to be a medical doctor. Often no one asked the child if they wanted to be a doctor. It was assumed. It was the profession with the promise of the greatest financial reward.</div>

<div class="line_en">Because students leave school without financial skills, millions of educated people pursue their profession successfully, but later find themselves struggling financially. They work harder, but don't get ahead. What is missing from their education is not how to make money, but how to spend money -- what to do after you make it. It's called financial aptitude -- what you do with the money once you make it, how to keep people from taking it from you, how long you keep it, and how hard that money works for you. Most people cannot tell why they struggle financially because they don't understand cash flow. A person can be highly educated, professionally successful and financially illiterate. These people often work harder than they need to because they learned how to work hard, but not how to have their money work for them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="同时，由于学生们没有获得财务技能就离开了学校，成千上万受过教育的人追求到了职业上的成功，却最终发现他们仍在财务问题中挣扎。他们努力工作，但并无进展，他们所受的教育不是如何挣钱，而是如何花钱，这产生了所谓的理财态度——挣了钱后该怎么办？怎样防止别人从你手中拿走钱？你能多长时间拥有这些钱？你如何让钱为你工作？大多数人不明白为什么他们会身处财务困境，因为他们不明白现金流。一个人可能受过高等教育而且事业成功，但也可能是财务上的文盲。这种人往往比需要的更为努力地工作，因为他们知道应该如何努力工作，但却不知道如何让钱为他们工作。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Today, doctors are facing financial challenges I would not wish on my worst enemy; insurance companies taking control of the business, managed health care, government intervention, and malpractice suits, to name a few. Today, kids want to be basketball stars, golfers like Tiger Woods, computer nerds, movie stare, rock stars, beauty queens, or traders on Wall Street. Simply because that is where the fame, money and prestige is. That is the reason it is so hard to motivate kids in school today. They know that professional success is no longer solely linked to academic success, as it once was.</div>

As an employee, it appears as if the Social Security tax combined with the Medicare tax rate is roughly 7.5 percent, but it's really 15 percent since the employer must match the Social Security amount. In essence, it is money the employer cannot pay you. On top of that, you still have to pay income tax on the amount deducted from your wages for Social Security tax, income you never receive because it went directly to Social Security through withholding. Then, their liabilities go up.</div>

<div class="line_en">But because of this, both Mike and I just could not go along with the standard dogma that our teachers preached, And that caused the problems. Whenever the teacher said, "If you don't get good grades, you won't do well in the real world," Mike and I just raised our eyebrows. When we were told to follow set procedures and not deviate from the rules, we could see how this schooling process actually discouraged creativity. We started to understand why our rich dad told us that schools were designed to produce good employees instead of employers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所以，我和迈克时常有幸花几个小时听那些聪明人说话并向他们学习。 因此，迈克和我很难遵循老师所教的那些传统的教条，这样问题就来了。当老师说“如果你得不到好成绩，在社会上也干不好”时，我和迈克就皱起了眉头。当我们被告知要遵循既定的程序、不要偏离规矩时，我们看到这种学校的程序是如何扼杀创造性的。我们开始明白为什么富爸爸说学校是生产好雇员而不是好雇主的地方。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Occasionally Mike or I would ask our teachers how what we studied was applicable, or we asked why we never studied money and how it worked. To the later question, we often got the answer that money was not important, that if we excelled in our education, the money would follow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈克和我经常问我们的学校老师，我们所学的东西为什么不实用，或是问为什么我们不学习有关钱的知识及其运动规律。对后一个问题，我们得到的回答常常是钱并不重要，如果我们学习优秀，钱自然会来的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mike and I learned more sitting at his meetings than we did in all our years of school, college included. Mike's dad was not school educated, but he was financially educated and successful as a result. He use to tell us over and over again. "An intelligent person hires people who are more intelligent than they are." So Mike and I had the benefit of spending hours listening to and, in the process, learning from intelligent people.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈克和我通过参加富爸爸开的各种会议学到了不少的东西，甚至在某些方面比在学校里包括大学里学到的都要多。迈克的爸爸没有受过高等学校教育，但他有很多的财务知识并且最终获得了成功。他曾一遍又一遍地对我们说：“聪明人总是雇比他更聪明的人。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">My highly educated dad never pressured me about my grades. I often wondered why. But we did begin to argue about money. By the time I was 16, I probably had a far better foundation with money than both my mom and dad. I could keep books, I listened to tax accountants, corporate attorneys, bankers, real estate brokers, investors and so forth. My dad talked to teachers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我那受过高等教育的爸爸从不对我的成绩施加压力，这使我时常感到惊讶，但我们为钱的事争论过。我想在历岁时，我就已经有了比爸妈更多的财务基础知识。因为我经常看书，经常听审计师、企业律师、银行家、房地产经纪人、投资人的谈话，而爸爸每天只同老师们谈话。">查看中文翻译</div>
