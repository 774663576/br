<div class="line_en">The riders were dismounting when he emerged from his tent; half a dozen knights, and twoscore mounted archers and men-at-arms. "Jaime!" roared a shaggy man clad in gilded ringmail and a fox-fur cloak. "So gaunt, and all in white! And bearded too!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他走出帐篷时，来客已纷纷下马，包括六名骑士、四十名骑兵和马弓手。“詹姆！”一名身穿镀金锁甲与狐皮披风、胡子拉碴的男人大吼，“你瘦了，那么苍白！还蓄了胡子！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"This? Mere stubble, against that mane of yours, coz." Ser Daven's bristling beard and bushy mustache grew into sidewhiskers as thick as a hedgerow, and those into the tangled yellow thicket atop his head, matted down by the helm he was removing. Somewhere in the midst of all that hair lurked a pug nose and a pair of lively hazel eyes. "Did some outlaw steal your razor?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这点毛吗？和你相比，小巫见大巫喽，老表。”达冯爵士竖立的鬓须长满整个下巴，浓厚有如树篱，头上是一窝黄色乱发——被那顶他刚摘下来的头盔压得扁扁的。在满脸毛发中，挤出来一只狮子鼻和一对炯炯有神的淡褐色眼睛，“啧，啧，你的剃刀被土匪偷了吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The boy has good instincts. "Outlaws don't blow trumpets to herald their arrival," Jaime told him. "I shan't need my sword. That will be my cousin, the Warden of the West."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这孩子有本能。“土匪是不会吹喇叭预报的，”詹姆告诉他，“无须拿剑。这一定是我表弟，新任西境守护驾到。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I vowed I would not let my hair be cut until my father was avenged." For a man who looked so leonine, Daven Lannister sounded oddly sheepish. "The Young Wolf got to Karstark first, though. Robbed me of my vengeance." He handed his helm to a squire and pushed his fingers through his hair where the weight of the steel had crushed it down. "I like a bit of hair. The nights grow colder, and a little foliage helps to keep your face warm. Aye, and Aunt Genna always said I had a brick for a chin." He clasped Jaime by the arms. "We feared for you after the Whispering Wood. Heard Stark's direwolf tore out your throat."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我发过毒誓，为父报仇之前，决不修面，”达冯·兰尼斯特的模样像狮子王，语气却十分随意，“但很遗憾，那少狼主先我一步干掉卡史塔克，剥夺了我复仇的权利。”他把头盔递给侍从，用手指狠狠梳理被压得不成形的头发。“结果我发现自己喜欢上了这些毛。夜里越来越冷，正如大树需要叶子，多几根毛可以保持温暖。而且吉娜姑妈说我的下巴像块砖，哈！”他双手抓住詹姆的胳膊。“呓语森林之后，我们都很为你担心，听说史塔克的冰原狼撕开了你的喉咙。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">His cousin shrugged. "The siege drags on. The Blackfish sits inside the castle, we sit outside in our camps. Bloody boring, if you want the truth." Ser Daven seated himself upon a camp stool. "Tully ought to make a sortie, to remind us all we're still at war. Be nice if he culled some Freys too. Ryman, for a start. The man's drunk more oft than not. Oh, and Edwyn. Not as thick as his father, but as full of hate as a boil's full of pus. And our own Ser Emmon… no, Lord Emmon, Seven save us, must not forget his new title… our Lord of Riverrun does nought but try to tell me how to run the siege. He wants me to take the castle without damaging it, since it is now his lordly seat."</div>

<div class="line_en">When Jaime had taken his leave of Lady Amerei, she had been weeping softly at the dissolution of her marriage whilst letting Lyle Crakehall console her. Her tears had not troubled him half so much as the hard looks on the faces of her kin as they stood about the yard. "I hope you do not intend to take vows as well, coz," he said to Daven. "The Freys are prickly where marriage contracts are concerned. I would hate to disappoint them again."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="实际上，当詹姆告别阿蕊丽夫人时，她只是轻轻哭泣，眼睁睁看着蓝赛尔解除婚约，并任李勒·克雷赫安慰自己。然而教詹姆担心的并非她的眼泪，而是庭院里她亲戚们的神情。“希望你不会悔婚，老表，”他告诉达冯，“佛雷家的人把婚约看得极重，我不想再让他们失望了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

Courteous enough, but chilly. I swore to him that I never asked to be made Warden of the West, that the honor should have gone to him, and he declared that he held no grudge against me, but you would never have known it from his tone. He stayed three days and hardly said three words to me. Would that he'd remained, I could have used his counsel. Our friends of Frey would not have dared vex Ser Kevan the way that they've been vexing me."</div>

<div class="line_en">If truth be told, he liked this life. He felt more comfortable amongst soldiers in the field than he ever had at court. And his men seemed comfortable with him as well. At one cookfire three crossbowmen offered him a share of a hare they'd caught. At another a young knight asked his counsel on the best way to defend against a warhammer. Down beside the river, he watched two washerwomen jousting in the shallows, mounted on the shoulders of a pair of men-at-arms. The girls were half-drunk and half-naked, laughing and snapping rolled-up cloaks at one another as a dozen other men urged them on. Jaime bet a copper star on the blond girl riding Raff the Sweetling, and lost it when the two of them went down splashing amongst the reeds.</div>

Jaime found Ser Ilyn Payne alone outside his tent, honing his greatsword with a whetstone. "Come," he said, and the silent knight rose, smiling thinly. He enjoys this, he realized. It pleases him to humiliate me nightly. It might please him even more to kill me. He liked to believe that he was getting better, but the improvement was slow and not without cost. Underneath his steel and wool and boiled leather Jaime Lannister was a tapestry of cuts and scabs and bruises.</div>

He ended on his knees, with the silent knight's sword at his throat and his own lost in the reeds. In the moonlight the pockmarks on Payne's face were large as craters.

<div class="line_en">The last day of their journey was cold and gusty. The wind rattled amongst the branches in the bare brown woods and made the river reeds bow low along the Red Fork. Even mantled in the winter wool of the Kingsguard, Jaime could feel the iron teeth of that wind as he rode beside his cousin Daven. It was late afternoon when they sighted Riverrun, rising from the narrow point where the Tumblestone joined the Red Fork. The Tully castle looked like a great stone ship with its prow pointed downriver. Its sandstone walls were drenched in red-gold light, and seemed higher and thicker than Jaime had remembered. This nut will not crack easily, he thought gloomily. If the Blackfish would not listen, he would have no choice but to break the vow he'd made to Catelyn Stark. The vow he'd sworn his king came first.</div>

The Frey lordlings and their knights had raised their pavilions comfortably upstream of the latrine trenches; downstream were muddy hovels, wayns, and oxcarts. "Ser Ryman don't want his boys getting bored, so he gives them whores and cockfights and boar baiting," Ser Daven said. "He's even got himself a bloody singer.

Above them streamed the banners of House Tully, the silver trout defiant on its striped field of red and blue. But the highest tower flew a different flag; a long white standard emblazoned with the direwolf of Stark. "The first time I saw Riverrun, I was a squire green as summer grass," Jaime told his cousin.

Her older sister had seemed more interesting, though Catelyn was promised to some northern boy, the heir of Winterfell… but at that age, no girl interested Jaime half so much as Hoster's famous brother, who had won renown fighting the Ninepenny Kings upon the Stepstones.

To reach Ser Daven's camp they had to ride through Emmon Frey's, past the pavilions of the river lords who had bent their knees and been accepted back into the king's peace. Jaime noted the banners of Lychester and Vance, of Roote and Goodbrook, the acorns of House Smallford and Lord Piper's dancing maiden, but the banners he did not see gave him pause. The silver eagle of Mallister was nowhere in evidence; nor the red horse of Bracken, the willow of the Rygers, the twining snakes of Paege.

<div class="line_en">"Reasons?" Lady Genna made a rude noise. "They had best be good reasons. The Swords and Stars troubled even the Targaryens. The Conqueror himself tread carefully with the Faith, so they would not oppose him. And when Aegon died and the lords rose up against his sons, both orders were in the thick of that rebellion. The more pious lords supported them, and many of the smallfolk. King Maegor finally had to put a bounty on them. He paid a dragon for the head of any unrepentant Warrior's Son, and a silver stag for the scalp of a Poor Fellow, if I recall my history. Thousands were slain, but nigh as many still roamed the realm, defiant, until the Iron Throne slew Maegor and King Jaehaerys agreed to pardon all those who would set aside their swords."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“道理？”吉娜姑妈粗鲁地喷了口鼻息，“不晓得她有什么好道理！连坦格利安王朝都难以应付圣剑骑士团和星辰武士团。征服者伊耿对待教会十分谨慎，处处小心，生怕出事。伊耿死后，维斯特洛的领主们蜂拥而起，来造他儿子的反，这两大教团武装正是叛乱的中坚力量，虔诚的领主纷纷倒戈，更吸引了无数平民百姓。如果我的历史记得不差，梅葛王不仅宣布他们为非法，还悬赏通缉，一颗战士之子的首级值一枚金龙，一张穷人集会成员的头皮值一枚银鹿。数千人因之被杀，但更多人在七国上下继续反抗，如燎原之势，直到铁王座杀掉了梅葛，杰赫里斯王登基后大赦天下，宣布只要放下武器，一律既往不咎，这才渐渐平息了动乱。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Lady Genna waved her cup in dismissal. "No, that horse has left the yard. Emm has it in his pointed head that he will rule the riverlands. And Lancel… I suppose we should have seen this coming from afar. A life protecting the High Septon is not so different from a life protecting the king, after all. Kevan will be wroth, I fear. As wroth as Tywin was when you got it in your head to take the white. At least Kevan still has Martyn for an heir. He can marry him to Gatehouse Ami in Lancel's place. Seven save us all." His aunt gave a sigh. "And speaking of the Seven, why would Cersei permit the Faith to arm again?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"What Kevan wants and what Lancel wants appear to be two different things." He told her of Lancel's decision to renounce wife and lands and lordship to fight for the Holy Faith. "If you still want Darry, write to Cersei and make your case."</div>

Tywin claimed the only thing Merryweather was good for was chuckling at the king's witticisms. His lordship chuckled himself right into exile, as I recall. Cersei has put some bastard on the council too, and a kettle in the Kingsguard. She has the Faith arming and the Braavosi calling in loans all over Westeros. None of which would be happening if she'd had the simple sense to make your uncle the King's Hand."</div>

<div class="line_en">His aunt looked at him strangely. "I was seven when Walder Frey persuaded my lord father to give my hand to Emm. His second son, not even his heir. Father was himself a thirdborn son, and younger children crave the approval of their elders. Frey sensed that weakness in him, and Father agreed for no better reason than to please him. My betrothal was announced at a feast with half the west in attendance. Ellyn Tarbeck laughed and the Red Lion went angry from the hall. The rest sat on their tongues. Only Tywin dared speak against the match. A boy of ten. Father turned as white as mare's milk, and Walder Frey was quivering." She smiled. "How could I not love him, after that? That is not to say that I approved of all he did, or much enjoyed the company of the man that he became… but every little girl needs a big brother to protect her. Tywin was big even when he was little." She gave a sigh. "Who will protect us now?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"Tired?" His aunt pursed her lips. "I suppose he has a right to be. It has been hard for Kevan, living all his life in Tywin's shadow. It was hard for all my brothers. That shadow Tywin cast was long and black, and each of them had to struggle to find a little sun. Tygett tried to be his own man, but he could never match your father, and that just made him angrier as the years went by. Gerion made japes. Better to mock the game than to play and lose. But Kevan saw how things stood early on, so he made himself a place by your father's side."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“累了？”姑妈撅起嘴唇。“好吧，他有权喊累。凯冯活得很辛苦，一辈子笼罩在泰温的阴影下，实际上，我的哥哥弟弟们都有这份困扰。泰温洒下长长的黑影，其他人只得在影子中挣扎着寻求阳光。提盖特想凭自个儿闯出一片天地，但始终比不上你父亲，结果越来越烦躁；吉利安喜欢开玩笑，因为嘲笑游戏本身总比认输好受些；凯冯打一开始就明白自己的位置，他认准方向，终其一生尽力辅佐你父亲。”">查看中文翻译</div>
