<div class="line_en">As soon as I allowed myself to feel anything for Barack, the feelings came rushing -- a toppling blast of lust, gratitude, fulfillment, wonder. Any worries I'd been harboring about my life and career and even about Barack himself seemed to fall away with that first kiss, replaced by a driving need to know him better, to explore and experience everything about him as fast as I could.</div>

<div class="line_en">Maybe because he was due back at Harvard in a month, we wasted no time being casual. Not quite ready to have a boyfriend sleeping under the same roof as my parents, I began spending nights at Barack's apartment, a cramped, second-floor walk-up above a storefront on a noisy section of Fifty-Third Street. The guy who normally lived there was a University of Chicago law student and he'd furnished it like any good student would, with mismatched garage-sale finds. There was a small table, a couple of rickety chairs, and a queen-sized mattress on the floor. Piles of Barack's books and newspapers covered the open surfaces and a good deal of the floor. He hung his suit jackets on the backs of the kitchen chairs and kept very little in the fridge. It wasn't homey, but now that I viewed everything through the lens of our fast-moving romance, it felt like home.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="也许因为他一个月后就要回哈佛了，所以我们好好利用这段时间过了一段放松的生活。我还没准备好让男朋友和自己的父母睡在同一个屋檐下，所以我开始在贝拉克的公寓过夜。那是一间拥挤的公寓，在二层，一层是临街的店铺，没有电梯，位置在53街的繁华地段。平常住在那里的租客是一名芝加哥大学法律专业的学生，他把那里装修得一看就是好学生的风格，东西都是从旧货市场淘来的，混搭在一起。公寓里有一张小桌子，几把摇摇晃晃的椅子，地板上放着一张特大号床垫。贝拉克的书和报纸散落在房间各处，占了地板很大一块空间。他的西装外套就挂在厨房的椅子背上，冰箱里几乎是空的。那里并不舒适，但我沉浸在快速发展的恋情中，看所有东西都是玫瑰色的，感觉那里就像家一样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">With no air-conditioning, we had little choice but to sleep with the windows open at night, trying to cool the sweltering apartment. What we gained in comfort, we sacrificed in quiet. In those days, Fifty-Third Street was a hub of late-night activity, a thoroughfare for cruising lowriders with unmuffled tailpipes. Almost hourly, it seemed, a police siren would blare outside the window or someone would start shouting, unloading a stream of outrage and profanity that would startle me awake on the mattress. If I found it unsettling, Barack did not. I sensed already that he was more at home with the unruliness of the world than I was, more willing to let it all in without distress. I woke one night to find him staring at the ceiling, his profile lit by the glow of streetlights outside. He looked vaguely troubled, as if he were pondering something deeply personal. Was it our relationship? The loss of his father?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因为没有空调，我们晚上睡觉只能开着窗户，好让闷热的公寓凉爽一些。身体舒服了，耳根却不清静了。那时候，53街是夜生活的中心，街上有人开跑车兜风，但排气管未消音。几乎每个小时，窗外都会响起警报声，或者会有人大声喊叫，并充满愤怒地辱骂，那些会把我从床垫上吓醒。虽然我觉得那令人不安，贝拉克却安之若素。我已经感觉到他比我更适应世界的失序，更愿意接纳它，而非感到苦恼。一天晚上，我醒来时发现他正盯着天花板，他的轮廓被外面的街灯照亮了。他看起来有点苦恼，好像在思考某件非常私密的事情。是我们之间的关系吗？还是他父亲的去世？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Barack intrigued me. He was not like anyone I'd dated before, mainly because he seemed so secure. He was openly affectionate. He told me I was beautiful. He made me feel good. To me, he was sort of like a unicorn -- unusual to the point of seeming almost unreal. He never talked about material things, like buying a house or a car or even new shoes. His money went largely toward books, which to him were like sacred objects, providing ballast for his mind. He read late into the night, often long after I'd fallen asleep, plowing through history and biographies and Toni Morrison, too. He read several newspapers daily, cover to cover. He kept tabs on the latest book reviews, the American League standings, and what the South Side aldermen were up to. He could speak with equal passion about the Polish elections and which movies Roger Ebert had panned and why.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="贝拉克让我着迷。他和我之前交往过的所有人都不同，主要是因为他看起来让人非常有安全感。他的感情溢于言表。他会告诉我我很美丽。他让我感觉很好。对我来说，他就像一头独角兽，太不同寻常以至于感觉不太真实。他从不谈论物质话题，比如买房买车，甚至是买双新鞋。他的钱基本都花在书上，对他来说，书是神圣的东西，是他头脑的压舱物。他晚上会读书读到很晚，经常在我睡着后很久，他还在读历史、传记还有托妮·莫里森 [1]的作品。他每天都看好几份报纸，从头至尾地通读。他会密切关注最新的图书评论、美国棒球联盟比赛排名以及南城市政委员会委员的行动计划等。他会带着同样的激情谈论波兰选举，还有罗杰·埃伯特 [2]抨击了哪些电影以及为什么。【注：[1]托妮·莫里森（Toni Morrison，1931—），美国黑人女作家，世界文坛最重要的作家之一， 1993年获得诺贝尔文学奖。此外，她获得过许多文学奖项，包括美国国家图书奖、国家图书评论奖、普利策奖。其作品主要表现美国黑人的生活，视角敏锐，情感炽烈。2012年5月29日，美国时任总统贝拉克·奥巴马授予托妮·莫里森总统自由勋章，该勋章是美国最高荣誉的文职勋章，由美国总统一年一度颁发，与国会金质奖章并列为美国最高的平民荣誉。[2]罗杰·埃伯特（Roger Ebert， 1942—2013），全美最负盛名的影评人，也是美国有史以来第一位获得普利策奖的影评家。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The bulk of our time, of course, was still spent at work, in the plush stillness of the Sidley &amp; Austin offices, where every morning I shook off any dreaminess and zipped myself back into my junior-associate existence, returning dutifully to my stack of documents and the demands of corporate clients I'd never once meet. Barack, meanwhile, worked on his own documents in a shared office down the hall, increasingly fawned over by partners who found him impressive.</div>

<div class="line_en">This, I was learning, was how Barack's mind worked. He got himself fixated on big and abstract issues, fueled by some crazy sense that he might be able to do something about them. It was new to me, I have to say. Until now, I'd hung around with good people who cared about important enough things but who were focused primarily on building their careers and providing for their families. Barack was just different. He was dialed into the day-to-day demands of his life, but at the same time, especially at night, his thoughts seemed to roam a much wider plane.</div>

<div class="line_en">Still concerned about propriety, I insisted we keep our blooming relationship out of sight of our colleagues, though it hardly worked. Lorraine, my assistant, gave Barack a knowing smile each time he surfaced in my office. We'd even been busted the very first night we'd been out in public as a couple, shortly after our first kiss, having gone to the Art Institute and then to see Spike Lee's movie Do the Right Thing at Water Tower Place, where we bumped into one of the firm's most high-ranking partners, Newt Minow, and his wife, Josephine, in the popcorn line. They'd greeted us warmly, even approvingly, and made no comment on the fact we were together. But still, there we were.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我依然觉得不太得体，因此坚持认为我们应避开所有同事的视线，发展地下恋情，虽然这不怎么行得通。每次贝拉克来我的办公室时，我的助理洛琳都会向他会心一笑。我们在第一次接吻后不久，首次在公共场合约会就被撞了个正着。那天晚上，我们先去了芝加哥艺术学院，然后去水塔商厦看斯派克·李 [3]的电影《为所应为》，在排队买爆米花时，我们碰见了事务所级别最高的合伙人之一纽特·米诺和他的妻子约瑟芬。他们热情地跟我们打招呼，甚至还有点赞许的意思，对我们在一起的事没有作任何评论。无论如何，我们确实在一起了。【注：[3]斯派克·李（Spike Lee，1957—），美国黑人电影导演、制片人、作家、演员。1986年，其处女作《稳操胜券》大获成功，令斯派克一举成名。他一直致力于“拍出真正的黑人电影”，因而，其作品充满了对种族歧视、城市贫困、城市暴力等议题的关注和探讨。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Work, during this time, felt like a distraction -- the thing we had to do before we were allowed to charge back toward each other again. Away from the office, Barack and I talked endlessly, over leisurely walks around Hyde Park dressed in shorts and T-shirts and meals that seemed short to us but in reality went on for hours. We debated the merits of every single Stevie Wonder album before doing the same thing with Marvin Gaye. I was smitten. I loved the slow roll of his voice and the way his eyes softened when I told a funny story. I was coming to appreciate how he ambled from one place to the next, never worried about time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那时候，我感觉工作是件让人分心的事，是我们要见到对方前必须要做的事。在办公室之外，贝拉克和我聊起来就没完，我们穿着T恤和短裤在海德公园悠闲地散步，在一起吃饭会吃上几个小时，却感觉时间过得飞快。我们讨论史提夫·汪达每一张专辑的优点，然后接着讨论马文·盖伊 [4]。我对贝拉克着了迷。我喜欢听他缓慢的声音，喜欢看他在我讲了一个笑话后变得柔和的眼神。我也开始欣赏他从容的步态，他从不赶时间。【注：[4]马文·盖伊（Marvin Gaye，1939—1984），美国摩城唱片著名歌手、曲作者，有“摩城王子”之称，对许多灵魂歌手都有巨大影响，可以说是黑人流行音乐史上一位最受人敬重的超级巨星。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Each day brought small discoveries: I was a Cubs fan, while he liked the White Sox. I loved mac and cheese, and he couldn't stand it. He liked dark, dramatic movies, while I went all-in for rom-coms. He was a lefty with immaculate handwriting; I had a heavy right-hand scrawl. In the month before he went back to Cambridge, we shared what felt like every memory and stray thought, running through our childhood follies, teenage blunders, and the thwarted starter romances that had gotten us to each other. Barack was especially intrigued by my upbringing -- the year-to-year, decade-to-decade sameness of life on Euclid Avenue, with me and Craig and Mom and Dad making up four corners of a sturdy square. Barack had spent a lot of time in churches during his time as a community organizer, which had left him with an appreciation for organized religion, but at the same time he remained less traditional. Marriage, he told me early on, struck him as an unnecessary and overhyped convention.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我每天都会有一点儿小发现。我是小熊队的粉丝，他喜欢白袜队。我喜欢麦卡洛尼芝士意面 [5]，他受不了它的味道。他喜欢看黑暗的、有戏剧性的电影，我喜欢看浪漫喜剧。他是个左撇子，写得一手好字；我习惯用右手，字写得潦草难辨。在他回剑桥市 [6]之前的一个月里，我们似乎聊了各自的所有记忆和零散的思绪，从小时候干的傻事、少年时犯的错误，到各自之前谈过的不成功的恋爱，这些不成功的恋爱将我们引向彼此。贝拉克对我的成长经历尤其感兴趣。欧几里得大道的生活几十年如一日，我、克雷格、母亲和父亲组成了一个稳固的正方形。贝拉克在做社区组织者的时候在教堂待过很长时间，这让他对有组织的宗教很欣赏，但同时他并不传统。他之前就跟我说过，婚姻在他看来是一个不必要而且被过分夸张的习俗。【注：[5]麦卡洛尼芝士意面（Macaroni and Cheese），这款意面在美国广受欢迎，餐厅居家都很常见。非洲裔美国人将其划为“灵魂食物”（Soul Food）的代表。多数黑人家庭在感恩节时，烤火鸡边上必定有盘烤的奶酪麦卡洛尼。这也是著名脱口秀主持人奥普拉·温弗瑞的最爱。读非洲裔美国人的传记，常常可以看到关于母亲或祖母制作的麦卡洛尼芝士意面的温馨回忆。[6]剑桥市（Cambridge），与美国马萨诸塞州波士顿市紧邻的一个市，与波士顿市区隔查尔斯河相对，属于波士顿都市区。那里是两所世界著名大学哈佛大学和麻省理工学院的所在地。】">查看中文翻译</div>

He'd watched me dismiss Kevin the college football player as soon as I'd seen him in a furry mascot outfit. My parents knew better than to get too attached. They'd raised me to run my own life, and that's basically what I did. I was too focused and too busy, I'd told my parents plenty of times, to make room for any man.</div>

<div class="line_en">If my family was a square, then Barack's was a more elaborate piece of geometry, one that reached across oceans. He'd spent years trying to make sense of its lines. His mother, Ann Dunham, had been a seventeen-year-old college student in Hawaii in 1960, when she fell for a Kenyan student named Barack Obama. Their marriage was brief and confusing -- especially given that her new husband, it turned out, already had a wife in Nairobi.

<div class="line_en">And yet Barack was loved deeply. His grandparents on Oahu doted on both him and his younger half sister Maya. His mother, though still living in Jakarta, was warm and supportive from afar. Barack also spoke affectionately of another half sister in Nairobi, named Auma. He'd grown up with far less stability than I had, but he didn't lament it. His story was his story. His family life had left him self-reliant and curiously hardwired for optimism. The fact he'd navigated his unusual upbringing so successfully seemed only to reinforce the idea that he was ready to take on more.</div>

<div class="line_en">To them, he must have seemed young and lawyerly. I could see that they were sizing him up, trying to figure out whether he was some sort of opinionated outsider or in fact had something of value to offer. The atmosphere was plenty familiar to me. I'd grown up attending my great-aunt Robbie's weekly Operetta Workshop in an African Methodist Episcopal church not unlike this one. The women in the room were no different from the ladies who sang in Robbie's choir or who'd turned up with casseroles after Southside died. They were well-intentioned, community-minded women, often single mothers or grandmothers, the type who inevitably stepped in to help when no one else would volunteer.</div>

<div class="line_en">On a humid evening, I went with him as he did a favor for an old friend. One of his former community-organizer co-workers had asked if he could lead a training at a black parish in Roseland, on the Far South Side, an area that had been crippled by the steel mill closings of the mid-1980s. For Barack, it was a welcome one-night return to his old job and the part of Chicago where he'd once worked. It occurred to me as we walked into the church, both of us still dressed in our office clothes, that I'd never thought much about what a community organizer actually did. We followed a stairwell down to a low-ceilinged, fluorescent-lit basement area, where fifteen or so parishioners -- mostly women, as I remember -- were sitting in folding chairs in what looked to be a room that doubled as a day-care center, fanning themselves in the heat. I took a seat in the back as Barack walked to the front of the room and said hello.</div>

<div class="line_en">Barack hung his suit jacket on the back of his chair and took off his wristwatch, laying it on the table in front of him to keep an eye on the time. After introducing himself, he facilitated a conversation that would last about an hour, asking people to share their stories and describe their concerns about life in the neighborhood. Barack, in turn, shared his own story, tying it to the principles of community organizing. He was there to convince them that our stories connected us to one another, and through those connections, it was possible to harness discontent and convert it to something useful. Even they, he said -- a tiny group inside a small church, in what felt like a forgotten neighborhood -- could build real political power. It took effort, he cautioned. It required mapping strategy and listening to your neighbors and building trust in communities where trust was often lacking. It meant asking people you'd never met to give you a bit of their time or a tiny piece of their paycheck. It involved being told no in a dozen or a hundred different ways before hearing the "yes" that would make all the difference. (This, it seemed, was a large part of what an organizer did.)

He'd seen the process work, if not always smoothly, in the Altgeld Gardens public-housing project, where a group just like this one had managed to register new voters, rally residents to meet with city officials about asbestos contamination, and persuade the mayor's office to fund a neighborhood job-training center.</div>

Roseland had taken one hit after another, from the exodus of white families and the bottoming out of the steel industry to the deterioration of its schools and the flourishing of the drug trade. As an organizer working in urban communities, Barack had told me, he'd contended most often with a deep weariness in people -- especially black people -- a cynicism bred from a thousand small disappointments over time. I understood it. I'd seen it in my own neighborhood, in my own family. A bitterness, a lapse in faith. It lived in both of my grandfathers, spawned by every goal they'd abandoned and every compromise they'd had to make. It was inside the harried second-grade teacher who'd basically given up trying to teach us at Bryn Mawr. It was inside the neighbor who'd stopped mowing her lawn or keeping track of where her kids went after school.

My purpose had always been to see past my neighborhood -- to look ahead and overcome. And I had. I'd scored myself two Ivy League degrees. I had a seat at the table at Sidley &amp; Austin.

There was no expectation that I would leave my life there in the interim. As a still-newish associate at Sidley, I understood that the next phase of my career was critical -- that my accomplishments would determine whether I made partner or not. Having been through law school myself, I also knew how busy Barack would be. He'd been chosen as an editor on the Harvard Law Review, a monthly student-run journal that was considered one of the top legal publications in the country.

It was essentially a wooing process. As a student, I'd experienced for myself the power and temptation of the corporate-law industrial complex, having been given a binder as thick as a dictionary that listed law firms across the country and told that every one of them was interested in landing Harvard-educated lawyers. It would seem that with the imprimatur of a Harvard JD, you had a shot at working in any city, in any field of law, whether it be at a mammoth litigation firm in Dallas or a boutique real-estate firm in New York. If you were curious about any of them, you requested an on-campus interview. If that went well, you were then treated to a "fly-out," which amounted to a plane ticket, a five-star hotel room, and another round of interviews at the firm's office, followed by some extravagant wine-and-dine experience with recruiters like me. While at Harvard, I'd availed myself of fly-outs to San Francisco and Los Angeles, in part to check out entertainment-law practices there but also, if I was honest, because I'd never been to California.</div>

<div class="line_en">Now that I was at Sidley and on the other side of the recruiting experience, my goal was to bring in law students who were not just smart and hard-driving but also something other than male and white. There was exactly one other African American woman on the recruiting team, a senior associate named Mercedes Laing. Mercedes was about ten years older than I was and became a dear friend and mentor. Like me, she had two Ivy League degrees and routinely sat at tables where nobody looked like her. The struggle, we agreed, was not to get used to it or accept it. In meetings on recruitment, I argued insistently -- and I'm sure brazenly, in some people's opinion -- that the firm cast a wider net when it came to finding young talent. The long-held practice was to engage students from a select group of law schools -- Harvard, Stanford, Yale, Northwestern, the University of Chicago, and the University of Illinois, primarily -- the places where most of the firm's lawyers had earned their degrees. It was a circular process: one generation of lawyers hiring new lawyers whose life experience mirrored their own, leaving little room for diversity of any sort. In fairness to Sidley, this was a problem (whether recognized or not) at virtually every big firm in the country. A National Law Journal survey from the time found that in large firms African Americans made up not quite 3 percent of all associates and less than 1 percent of all partners.</div>

<div class="line_en">Trying to help remedy the imbalance, I pushed for us to consider law students coming from other state schools and from historically black colleges like Howard University. When the recruiting team gathered in a conference room in Chicago with a pile of student résumés to review, I objected anytime a student was automatically dismissed for having a B on a transcript or for having gone to a less prestigious undergraduate program. If we were serious about bringing in minority lawyers, I asserted, we'd have to look more holistically at candidates. We'd need to think about how they'd used whatever opportunities life had afforded them rather than measuring them simply by how far they'd made it up an elitist academic ladder. The point wasn't to lower the firm's high standards: It was to realize that by sticking with the most rigid and old-school way of evaluating a new lawyer's potential, we were overlooking all sorts of people who could contribute to the firm's success. We needed to interview more students, in other words, before writing them off.</div>

<div class="line_en">At Christmastime that year, we flew to Honolulu. I'd never been to Hawaii before but was pretty certain I'd like it. I was coming from Chicago, after all, where winter stretched through April, where it was normal to keep a snow shovel stashed in the trunk of your car. I owned an unsettling amount of wool. For me, getting away from winter had always felt like a joyride. During college, I'd made a trip to the Bahamas with my Bahamian classmate David, and another to Jamaica with Suzanne. In both instances, I'd reveled in the soft air on my skin and the simple buoyancy I felt anytime I got close to the ocean. Maybe it was no accident that I was drawn to people who'd been raised on islands.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was no different with Barack. By now he'd spent more than a decade on the mainland, but Hawaii still mattered to him deeply. He wanted me to take it all in, from the splaying palm trees that lined the streets of Honolulu and the crescent arc of Waikiki Beach to the green drape of hills surrounding the city. For about a week, we stayed in a borrowed apartment belonging to family friends and made trips every day to the ocean, to swim and laze about in the sun. I met Barack's half sister Maya, who at nineteen was kind and smart and getting a degree at Barnard. She had round cheeks and wide brown eyes and dark hair that curled in a rich tangle around her shoulders. I met his grandparents Madelyn and Stanley Dunham, or "Toot and Gramps," as he called them. They lived in the same high-rise where they'd raised Barack, in a small apartment decorated with Indonesian textiles that Ann had sent home over the years.</div>

<div class="line_en">And I met Ann herself, a plump, lively woman with dark frizzy hair and the same angular chin as Barack. She wore chunky silver jewelry, a bright batik dress, and the kind of sturdy sandals I would guess an anthropologist might wear. She was friendly toward me and curious about my background and my career. It was clear she adored her son -- almost revered him -- and she seemed most eager to sit down and talk with him, describing her dissertation work and swapping book recommendations as if catching up with an old friend.</div>

<div class="line_en">Everyone in the family still called him Barry, which I found endearing. Though they'd left their home state of Kansas back in the 1940s, his grandparents seemed to me like the misplaced midwesterners Barack had always described them as. Gramps was big and bearlike and told silly jokes. Toot, a stout, gray-haired woman who'd worked her way up to becoming the vice president of a local bank, made us tuna salad sandwiches for lunch. In the evenings, she served Ritz crackers piled with sardines for appetizers and put dinner on TV trays so that everyone could watch the news or play a heated game of Scrabble. They were a modest, middle-class family, in many ways not at all unlike my own.</div>

<div class="line_en">So many of my friends judged potential mates from the outside in, focusing first on their looks and financial prospects. If it turned out the person they'd chosen wasn't a good communicator or was uncomfortable with being vulnerable, they seemed to think time or marriage vows would fix the problem. But Barack had arrived in my life a wholly formed person. From our very first conversation, he'd shown me that he wasn't self-conscious about expressing fear or weakness and that he valued being truthful. At work, I'd witnessed his humility and willingness to sacrifice his own needs and wants for a bigger purpose.</div>

<div class="line_en">In Hawaii, Barack's intense and brainy side receded somewhat, while the laid-back part of him flourished. He was at home. And home was where he didn't feel the need to prove anything to anyone. We were late for everything we did, but it didn't matter -- not even to me. Barack's high school buddy Bobby, who was a commercial fisherman, took us out on his boat one day for some snorkeling and an aimless cruise. It was then that I saw Barack as relaxed as I'd ever seen him, lounging under a blue sky with a cold beer and an old friend, no longer fixated on the day's news or law school reading, or what should be done about income inequality. The sun-bleached mellowness of the island opened up space for the two of us, in part by giving us time we'd never before had.</div>

<div class="line_en">And now in Hawaii, I could see his character reflected in other small ways. His long-lasting friendships with his high school buddies showed his consistency in relationships. In his devotion to his strong-willed mother, I saw a deep respect for women and their independence. Without needing to discuss it outright, I knew he could handle a partner who had her own passions and voice. These were things you couldn't teach in a relationship, things that not even love could really build or change. In opening up his world to me, Barack was showing me everything I'd ever need to know about the kind of life partner he'd be.</div>

<div class="line_en">One afternoon, we borrowed a car and drove to the North Shore of Oahu, where we sat on a ribbon of soft beach and watched surfers rip across enormous waves. We stayed for hours, just talking, as one wave tipped into the next, as the sun dropped toward the horizon and the other beachgoers packed up to go home. We talked as the sky turned pink and then purple and finally went dark, as the bugs started to bite, as we began to get hungry. If I'd come to Hawaii to sample something of Barack's past, we were now sitting at the edge of a giant ocean, trying on a version of the future, discussing what kind of house we'd want to live in someday, what kind of parents we wanted to be. It felt speculative and a little daring to talk like this, but it was also reassuring, because it seemed as if maybe we'd never stop, that maybe this conversation between us could go on for life.</div>

Reverend Jackson had made a respectable run for the presidency, winning about a dozen primaries before ceding the nomination to Michael Dukakis.

We'd go long stretches without talking but then pick up the thread of our friendship with ease. As always, I called her Screwzy and she called me Miche. Our worlds continued to be as different as they'd been at school, when she was trekking off to eating-club parties and kicking her dirty laundry beneath the bed and I was color coding my Sociology 201 notes. Even then, Suzanne was like a sister whose life I could only track from afar, across the gulf of our inherent differences. She was maddening, charming, and always important to me. She'd ask my advice and then willfully ignore it. Would it be bad to date a philandering semi-famous pop star? Why, yes it would, but she'd do it anyway, because why not? Most galling to me was when she turned down an opportunity to go to an Ivy League business school after college, deciding that it would be too much work and therefore no fun. Instead, she got her MBA from a not-so-stressful program at a state school, which I viewed as kind of a lazy move.</div>

What I did know was that during the fall of 1989, while I wore patent leather pumps and sat through long, dull conference-room meetings at Sidley, Suzanne and her mother were trying not to spill curry on their sundresses in Cambodia and dancing at dawn on the grand walkways of the Taj Mahal. As I balanced my checkbook, picked up my dry cleaning, and watched the leaves wither and drop from the trees along Euclid Avenue, Suzanne was careening through hot, humid Bangkok in a tuk-tuk, hooting -- as I imagined it -- with joy.

<div class="line_en">It was a lot to ask of Verna, who'd recently lost her father and was wrestling with her own grief. But she was a true friend, a compassionate person. She phoned my office one day in May to relay the details of a visit.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我对弗娜的要求有点儿过分，因为她的父亲刚去世，她本人还没从悲痛中走出来。但她是一个真正的朋友，一个富有同情心的人。5月的一天，她打电话到我的办公室，向我描述她去看望苏珊娜的细节。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Back in Maryland, Suzanne was living with her disease. She was coping with medical appointments and surgeries and at the same time trying to care for her mother, who was also fighting an aggressive cancer that was, the doctors insisted, completely unrelated to Suzanne's. It was bad luck, bad fortune, freakish to the point of being too scary to contemplate. The rest of Suzanne's family was not particularly close-knit, except for two of her favorite female cousins who helped her out as much as they could. Angela drove down from New Jersey to visit sometimes, but she was juggling both a toddler and a job. I enlisted Verna, my law school friend, to go by when she could, as a sort of proxy for me. Verna had met Suzanne a couple of times while we were at Harvard and by sheer coincidence was now living in Silver Spring, in a building just across the parking lot from Suzanne's.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那时，在马里兰州，苏珊娜正在和病魔斗争。她要预约看病、做手术，同时还要照顾母亲。她的母亲也得了一种侵袭性的癌症，医生坚持说它跟苏珊娜的病完全没有关联。这就是运气不好，是厄运，恐怖到让人不敢去想。苏珊娜家里的其他人和她们走得不近，只有两个关系最好的表姐妹在尽力帮助她。安吉拉有时会从新泽西开车去看她，但毕竟她自己也有年幼的孩子需要照顾，还要工作。所以我就麻烦读法学院时的朋友弗娜，在有空的时候代我去看望她。我们在哈佛读书的时候，弗娜见过苏珊娜几次，非常凑巧的是，她当时就住在银泉市，和苏珊娜的家隔着一个停车场。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was Angela, finally, who called me in June and got right to the point. "If you're going to come, Miche," she said, "you'd better get to it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后是安吉拉打电话给我，那是6月的一天，她开门见山地说：“要是你打算来的话，米西，那最好现在就过来。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That Suzanne needed to have her hair combed should have told me everything, but I'd walled myself off from the truth. Some part of me still insisted this wasn't happening. I held on to the idea that Suzanne's health would turn around, even as the evidence against it stacked up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="苏珊娜现在需要别人给她梳头发，这件事应该告诉了我一切，但是我刻意让自己回避真相。我内心的一部分还在坚持这件事没有发生。我固执地认为苏珊娜的身体会好起来，虽然我得到的消息越来越表明事情并非如此。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I combed her hair," she said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我给她梳了头发。”她说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">By then, Suzanne had been moved to a hospital. She was too weak to talk, slipping in and out of consciousness. There was nothing left to feed my denial. I hung up the phone and bought a plane ticket. I flew east, caught a taxi to the hospital, took the elevator to the right floor, walked the hallway to her room, and found her there, lying in bed as Angela and her cousin watched over her, everyone silent. Suzanne's mother, it turned out, had died just a few days earlier, and now Suzanne was in a coma. Angela made room for me to perch on the side of her bed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那时候，苏珊娜已经住进了医院。她身体虚弱到已经无法讲话，意识时有时无。我无法再继续拒绝真相了。我挂断电话，买了机票，向东飞去，而后打出租车赶到医院，坐电梯到苏珊娜所在的楼层，穿过走廊到了她的病房。她躺在病床上，安吉拉和她的表姐妹在守着她，大家都默默无言。我那时才得知，苏珊娜的母亲于几天前刚刚去世，接着苏珊娜也昏迷了。安吉拉给我腾出地方，让我伏在苏珊娜的床边。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I stared hard at Suzanne, at her perfect heart-shaped face and reddish-brown skin, feeling comforted somehow by the youthful smoothness of her cheeks and the girlish curve in her lips. She seemed oddly undiminished by the illness. Her dark hair was still lustrous and long; someone had put it in two ropy braids that reached almost to her waist. Her track runner's legs lay hidden beneath the blankets. She looked young, like a sweet, beautiful twenty-six-year-old who was maybe in the middle of a nap.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我紧紧盯着苏珊娜，看着她完美的心形脸、她红褐色的皮肤，她的脸依然光滑青春，嘴唇有少女的曲线，那让我感到一点儿安慰。她的容貌似乎并没有被疾病损害。她的长发依旧黝黑光亮，不知谁给她编了两条及腰的发辫。她那田径运动员般的长腿藏在毯子下。她看起来很年轻，像一个在睡梦中的可爱而美丽的二十六岁女孩。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I regretted not coming earlier. I regretted the many times, over the course of our seesawing friendship, that I'd insisted she was making a wrong move, when possibly she'd been doing it right. I was suddenly glad for all the times she'd ignored my advice. I was glad that she hadn't overworked herself to get some fancy business school degree. That she'd gone off for a lost weekend with a semi-famous pop star, just for fun. I was happy that she'd made it to the Taj Mahal to watch the sunrise with her mom. Suzanne had lived in ways that I had not.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我后悔自己没有早点儿过来。我后悔在我们拉锯般的友谊中，我许多次都坚持说她的行为是错的，但也许她做的是对的。我突然对她一直无视我的建议感到高兴。我高兴她没有为了拿到某个耀眼的商学院学位而让自己劳累过度，我高兴她为了好玩而和一个半紫不红的流行歌星在周末约会，我高兴她和母亲一起去了泰姬陵看日出。苏珊娜的生活是我未曾体验过的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That day, I held her limp hand and watched as her breathing grew ragged, as eventually there were long pauses between her inhales. At some point, the nurse gave us a knowing nod. It was happening. Suzanne was leaving. My mind went dark. I had no deep thoughts. I had no revelations about life or loss. If anything, I was mad.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天，我握着她无力的手，看着她的呼吸变得窘迫，最后两次呼吸之间有个长长的停顿。在某个时刻，护士会意地向我们点点头。事情要发生了。苏珊娜就要走了。我的大脑一片空白。我没有什么深沉的思考，没有什么对生活和死亡的顿悟。我只是情绪崩溃了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">To say that it was unfair that Suzanne got sick and died at twenty-six seems too simple a thing. But it was a fact, as cold and ugly as they come. What I was thinking as I finally left her body in that hospital room was this: She's gone and I'm still here. Outside in the hallway, there were people wandering in hospital gowns who were far older and sicker looking than Suzanne, and they were still here. I would take a packed flight back to Chicago, drive along a busy highway, ride an elevator up to my office. I'd see all these people looking happy in their cars, walking the sidewalk in their summer clothes, sitting idly in cafés, and working at their desks, all of them oblivious to what happened to Suzanne -- apparently unaware that they, too, could die at any moment. It felt perverse, how the world just carried on. How everyone was still here, except for my Suzanne.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="苏珊娜才二十六岁就生病离世是不公平的，你可以简单地这样说。但这是事实，虽然它冰冷、丑陋。最后离开她的病房时，我心里想的是：她走了，而我依然在这里。在病房外的走廊里，穿着病号服的人走来走去，他们看起来比苏珊娜要老得多，病情要重得多，但是他们依旧还在这里。我搭乘一架满员的航班回到芝加哥，开车驶过一条交通繁忙的道路，坐电梯上到我的办公室。一路上我看到人们开心地开着车，穿着夏天的衣服走在人行道上，无所事事地坐在咖啡馆里，或在办公桌前工作，所有人都不知道苏珊娜发生了什么事，当然更不会去想他们自己可能也会随时死去。世界就这样继续运行着，这让我有种怪异的感觉。所有人都还在这里，除了我的苏珊娜。">查看中文翻译</div>
