<div class="line_en">And things had been done up at the old Overlook that never made the papers, because money has a way of talking. But the people in Sidewinder had a pretty good idea. Most of the hotel's chambermaids came from here, and chambermaids see a lot.</div>

<div class="line_en">Larry Durkin was a tall and skinny man with a morose face overtopped with a luxuriant mane of red hair. Hallorann had caught him just as he was leaving the Conoco station, the morose face buried deeply inside an army-issue parka. He was reluctant to do any more business that stormy day no matter how far Hallorann had come, and even more reluctant to rent one of his two snowmobiles out to this wild-eyed black man who insisted on going up to the old Overlook. Among people who had spent most of their lives in the little town of Sidewinder, the hotel had a smelly reputation. Murder had been done up there. A bunch of hoods had run the place for a while, and cutthroat businessmen had run it for a while, too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="拉里·德金是个身材瘦削的高个子，脸色抑郁，留着一头浓密的红头发。他正要离开科诺科加油站时，哈洛伦碰上了他，那张忧郁的脸深深地埋在军用风雪衣里。不管哈洛伦是从多远来的，他也不愿意在这个暴风雪的日子里多干一点事，更不愿意把两辆雪地车中的一辆租给这个坚持要上远望饭店的脾气暴躁的黑鬼。在大半辈子生活在小镇塞德温得的人们中间，远望饭店是个声名狼藉的地方。那里发生过谋杀，一帮恶棍经营过一段时间，不少冷酷无情的实业家也经营过一段时间。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I don't know," Hallorann muttered. He felt sick with the time this was taking. He was speaking with a country man, and he knew that all country men feel a similar need to approach their business obliquely, to smell around its corners and sides before plunging into the middle of dealing. But there was no time, because now he was one scared nigger and if this went on much longer he just might decide to cut and run.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不知道，”哈洛伦咕哝道，这样耗时间使他感到很恶心。他在跟一个山里人讲话，他知道所有的山里人办事时都觉得有必要小心谨慎，这里嗅嗅那里闻闻，然后才进入正题。但现在没时间了，因为他现在是个惊慌失措的黑鬼，如果再这样下去，他可能会索性一走了之。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Hallorann's nerve had begun to crack. The last few miles into Sidewinder had been very bad. Once a gust of wind that must have been tooling along at better than sixty miles an hour had floated the Buick all the way around in a 360° turn. And there were still miles to travel with God alone knew what at the other end of them. He was terrified for the boy. Now it was almost ten minutes to seven and he had this whole song and dance to go through again.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Sent you here, did he?" Durkin asked, unlocking one of the garage bays and leading Hallorann inside. "Good to know the old rip's got some sense left.

"Now what in the tarnal creation would you want up at that place, fella?"</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“好吧，”德金说，并不难为他。“霍华德让你来的，这就行了。你把这辆‘北极猫’开去。我给油桶加5加仑汽油，油箱是满的。来回都够了，我猜。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Don't fuss with me," Durkin interrupted, still mildly. "I ain't sending you out to freeze. I only got to walk down two blocks and I'm at my own supper table. Give it over." Slightly dazed, Hallorann traded his overcoat for Durkin's fur-lined parka.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“托兰斯的儿子，”德金说，摇着头。“小孩子模样儿长得不错，是吗？他和他爸爸下大雪之前常来这儿，多数时候开着饭店的卡车。他们俩看起来好像亲热得分不开似的，那才叫爱他爸爸呢。但愿他平安无事。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Lemme help you push that out," Durkin said. They rolled the snowmobile across the oil-stained concrete and toward the garage bay. "You ever drove one of these before?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Now they were in the service station's snow-filled front lot, and Durkin had raised his voice to make himself heard over the battering of the wind. "Stay on the road!" he shouted at Hallorann's ear. "Keep your eye on the guardrail posts and the signs and you'll be all right, I guess. If you get off the road, you're going to be dead. Understand?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Hallorann nodded and twisted the throttle slowly. The snowmobile purred forward, the headlamp cutting a clean cone of light through the thickly falling snow. He saw Durkin's upraised hand in the rearview mirror, and raised his own in return. Then he nudged the handlebars to the left and was traveling up Main Street, the snowmobile coursing smoothly through the white light thrown by the streetlamps. The speedometer stood at thirty miles an hour. It was ten past seven. At the Overlook, Wendy and Danny were sleeping and Jack Torrance was discussing matters of life and death with the previous caretaker.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈洛伦点了点头，慢慢动了动节流阀。雪地车突突向前开去，前灯灯光穿透密集的飞雪，划出了一个清晰的锥形光柱。他在观后镜中看到德金举起的手，于是他也举手挥了挥。然后，他将把手推到左边，在主街上驶去，雪地车平稳地穿行在街灯洒下的白光中。速度计显示车速是30英里每小时。现在是7点10分。此时，在远望饭店，温迪和丹尼在睡觉，杰克·托兰斯在与从前的守护人讨论生与死的问题。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Clenching his teeth, he turned the throttle higher and watched the needle on the speedometer climb past forty and settle at forty-five. He seemed to be going horribly fast and yet he was afraid it wasn't fast enough. At this speed it would take him almost an hour to get to the Overlook. But at a higher speed he might not get there at all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他紧咬着牙，调高了节流阀，观看着速度计的指针越过40，停在了45上。速度似乎已经快得吓人了，但他还是担心不够快。以这个速度走下去，一个小时就能到达远望饭店。但是，如果速度再快些，他可能永远都到不了那里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Five blocks up Main, the streetlamps ended. For half a mile there were small houses, all buttoned tightly up against the storm, and then only wind-howling darkness… In the black again with no light but the thin spear of the snowmobile's headlamp, terror closed in on him again, a childlike fear, dismal and disheartening. He had never felt so alone. For several minutes, as the few lights of Sidewinder dwindled away and disappeared in the rearview, the urge to turn around and go back was almost insurmountable. He reflected that for all of Durkin's concern for Jack Torrance's boy, he had not offered to take the other snowmobile and come with him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在主街上经过5个街区后，街灯没有了。之后半英里的路上还有小房子，全都关得严严实实的，再往后便只剩下狂风怒号的黑暗。四周除了雪地车前灯射出的一小柱光外一片漆黑，恐怖又向他逼来，孩子般的害怕，阴沉，令人气馁，他从未感到过如此地孤独。有几分钟，当塞德温得的几盏孤灯逐渐远去并最终从观后镜中消失之后，调头回去的冲动几乎无法遏制。他想，尽管德金是那样关心杰克·托兰斯的儿子，但他还是没有提出开着另一辆雪地车跟他一起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He could feel the voice that had almost wrecked him outside of Sidewinder still trying to get in, to get past his defenses to the soft meat inside. If it had been strong twenty-five miles back, how much stronger would it be now? He couldn't keep it out entirely. Some of it was slipping through, flooding his brain with sinister subliminal images. More and more he got the image of a badly hurt woman in a bathroom, holding her hands up uselessly to ward off a blow, and he felt more and more that the woman must be -- (Jesus, watch out!) The embankment was looming up ahead of him like a freight train. Wool -- gathering, he had missed a turn sign. He jerked the snowmobile's steering gear hard right and it swung around, tilting as it did so. From underneath came the harsh grating sound of the snowtread on rock. He thought the snowmobile was going to dump him, and it did totter on the knife-edge of balance before half-driving, half-skidding back down to the more or less level surface of the snow-buried road. Then the dropoff was ahead of him, the headlamp showing an abrupt end to the snowcover and darkness beyond that. He turned the snowmobile the other way, a pulse beating sickly in his throat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他能感觉到，到达塞德温得前那个差点使他车毁人亡的声音还在试图侵入，试图越过他的防线进入他的体内。如果说它在25英里之前很有威力，那么现在它增强到了何种程度？他不能完全将它排除在防线之外，其中有一些溜了进去，他的大脑里因此充斥着阴森的非感知的图像。他越来越频繁地接收到一个伤势严重的女人的图像，她在浴室里，举着手徒劳地阻挡一次打击，他愈来愈感觉到那个女人肯定是——（天哪，小心！）路堤像一列货车在他眼前赫然耸现。胡思乱想的时候，他漏看了一个转弯标志。他将雪地车的转向舵猛地向正右方拉去，车打了一个转，眼看车身陡然倾斜起来，车下传来了履带和岩石相互挤压的嘎嘎声。他想，雪地车会把他扔出去。车身侧翻起来，好像平衡在刀脊上一样，然后，一半是通过他的操作，一半靠自身的滑动，车回到了积雪覆盖的多少还算平坦的路面上。接着，悬崖出现在他前面，前灯照亮的积雪突然中断了，再远处即是一片黑暗。他把雪地车转向另一边，嗓子里的脉搏令人心悸地跳动着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He kept his eyes glued to the passing guardrails and the dime-sized reflectors mounted on top of each one. Many of them were buried under drifts. Twice he saw curve signs dangerously late and felt the snowmobile riding up the drifts that masked the dropoff before turning back onto where the road was in the summertime. The odometer counted off the miles at a maddeningly slow clip -- five, ten, finally fifteen. Even behind the knitted ski mask his face was beginning to stiffen up and his legs were growing numb.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的眼睛一刻也没从向后退去的护栏和每根栏柱上硬币大小的反光镜片上挪开，许多栏柱埋在了雪堆里。有两次他到了跟前才看见转弯标志，感觉到在回到夏天里是公路的地方之前，雪地车正往掩盖着悬崖的雪堆上冲去。里程表里的数字变化得令人发疯地慢——5、10、终于到了15。尽管戴着针织滑雪罩，他的脸还是僵硬起来了，他的腿也渐渐麻木了。">查看中文翻译</div>

Just a glimpse, and then it was blotted out by a rising fold of land.

Limned in stark blacks and whites, Hallorann first thought it was some hideously huge timberwolf that had been driven down from the high country by the storm. Then, as he closed on it, he recognized it and horror closed his throat.</div>

<div class="line_en">Hallorann screamed and twisted the handlebars hard right, ducking low at the same time. Scratching, ripping pain scrawled itself across his face, his neck, his shoulders. The ski mask was torn open down the back. He was hurled from the snowmobile. He hit the snow, plowed through it, rolled over.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈洛伦惊叫起来，急忙将把手向正右方扭去，同时低下了头。刮擦、撕扯带来的疼痛不分青红皂白地从他的脸上、脖子上、肩膀上扫了过去。滑雪面罩破了，挂到了背上。他从雪地车上摔了出来，栽进雪里，犁开了一大片雪，翻滚着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Not a wolf but a lion. A hedge lion.</div>

<div class="line_en">Its features were a mask of black shadow and powdered snow, its haunches wound tight to spring. And it did spring, snow billowing around its pistoning rear legs in a silent burst of crystal glitter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="它的面孔是一片阴影和雪粉，腿臀部后蹲，准备随时跃起。它跳起来了，雪粒纷纷在后腿周围腾起，闪着水晶般的光芒，无声地飞散开去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He could feel it coming for him. In his nostrils there was a bitter smell of green leaves and holly. A huge hedge paw batted him in the small of the back and he flew ten feet through the air, splayed out like a rag doll. He saw the snowmobile, riderless, strike the embankment and rear up, its headlamp searching the sky. It fell over with a thump and stalled.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他能感到它逼过来了，一股苦涩的绿叶和冬青味钻进了他的鼻孔里。一只树篱巨爪拍在他腰背上，他一下子飞出去了十几英尺远，四肢伸开像个碎布洋娃娃。他看见无人驾驶的雪地车撞上路堤，竖起来，前灯射向天空，哐地一声翻倒了，停下来了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Something raked across the front of the parka, shredding it. It might have been stiff twigs, but Hallorann knew it was claws.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="什么东西耙过了风雪衣的前襟，留下了许多破布条，可能是硬枝条，但哈洛伦知道那是爪子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You're not there!" Hallorann screamed at the circling, snarling hedge lion.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你不存在！”哈洛伦对正在兜圈子、嗷嗷叫的树篱狮子吼道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You're not there at all!" He struggled to his feet and made it halfway to the snowmobile before the lion lunged, batting him across the head with a needle-tipped paw. Hallorann saw silent, exploding lights.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你根本就不存在！”他奋力站起来，刚向雪地前走了几步，这时，狮子又扑了过来，用带着针尖的爪子一掌扇在他头上，哈洛伦顿时感到眼前金星直冒。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Not there," he said again, but it was a fading mutter. His knees unhinged and dropped him into the snow. He crawled for the snowmobile, the right side of his face a scarf of blood. The lion struck him again, rolling him onto his back like a turtle. It roared playfully.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不存在，”他又说，但已只剩下一声微弱的咕哝。他膝盖一软，倒在了雪里。他向雪地车爬去，右侧脸上血淋淋的。狮子又打了他一巴掌，哈洛伦像只乌龟那样翻到了背上。狮子顽皮地吼起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
