<div class="line_en">I felt like -- like I don't know what. Like this wasn't real. Like I was in some Goth version of a bad sitcom. Instead of being the A/V dweeb about to ask the head cheerleader to the prom, I was the finished-second-place werewolf about to ask the vampire's wife to shack up and procreate. Nice.</div>

<div class="line_en">Edward didn't answer or comment on my thoughts as he led the way back to the house. I wondered about the place that he'd chosen to stop. Was it far enough from the house that the others couldn't hear his whispers? Was that the point?</div>

Warmer than before, but it felt cool against my skin, like most things did. "More than anyone else, you've got some magic waiting to make things right for you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“尤其是你，”她说。她笑着，从我手里抽出一只手贴在我的脸庞。尽管她的手已经温热了不少，但是就像其他东西一样，以我的体温来说还是觉得很冷。“比任何人都要强烈，在你前方的路上一定还有神奇的魔力在等着你，把你拉回正轨。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Only Seth and I were still, the eye in the center of a storm of bared teeth and flattened ears. Seth's nose was almost touching the ground, bowed under Sam's commands. I felt his pain at the coming disloyalty. For him this was a betrayal -- during that one day of alliance, fighting beside Edward Cullen, Seth had truly become the vampire's friend.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="只有我和塞思仍然静止着，处于暴风圈中心的我们咧着嘴，耷拉着耳朵。塞思的鼻尖都快触到地上了，在山姆的命令下低垂着身子。我能体会到他因为不忠而感到难过。对他来说这意味着背叛——虽然只经历了一天的联盟，和爱德华·卡伦并肩战斗，塞思已经完全成了吸血鬼的朋友了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sam had never pushed his authority this far before; I knew he honestly hated to see Seth kneeling before him like a slave at the foot of his master. He wouldn't force this if he didn't believe that he had no other choice. He couldn't lie to us when we were linked mind to mind like this. He really believed it was our duty to destroy Bella and the monster she carried. He really believed we had no time to waste. He believed it enough to die for it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山姆从未如此行使过他的权利，我知道他应该也不喜欢看到塞思像个奴才一样在他主人面前跪下来。如果不是因为没有其他选择，他也不会专治到这个地步。当我们的思想紧密相连的时候，他无法说谎。他是真的认为摧毁贝拉和她肚中的怪胎，是我们的义务。他是真的认为我们没时间可浪费的了。他是真的相信这些决断才愿意视死如归的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I saw that he would face Edward himself; Edward's ability to read our thoughts made him the greatest threat in Sam's mind. Sam would not let someone else take on that danger.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我看到他准备自己面对爱德华；后者阅读我们思想的能力在山姆心中是最大的忧患。山姆不会让其他人来承担这份危险的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He saw Jasper as the second-greatest opponent, which is why he'd given him to me. He knew that I had the best chance of any of the pack to win that fight. He'd left the easiest targets for the younger wolves and Leah. Little Alice was no danger without her future vision to guide her, and we knew from our time of alliance that Esme was not a fighter. Carlisle would be more of a challenge, but his hatred of violence would hinder him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他视贾斯帕为第二大对手，也是为什么山姆将他交给我的原因。他知道我比队伍中其他人赢得这场对决的胜算更大。他将最容易对付的目标留给了年轻的狼和利亚。娇小的爱丽丝如果没有了她那预见未来的本领来保护她，根本构不成威胁。我们也从曾经联盟时期了解到埃斯米是不会这种格斗的。卡莱尔是个较大的阻碍，但是他厌恶暴力的本性却会成为他自身的绊脚石。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Everything was inside out. This afternoon, I'd been chomping at the bit to attack them. But Seth had been right -- it wasn't a fight I'd been ready for. I'd blinded myself with that hate. I hadn't let myself look at it carefully, because I must have known what I would see if I did.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="整件事彻底颠倒了过来。这个下午我才是那个恨得牙痒痒要去攻击他们的人。但是塞思是对的——我还没有为这场战争做好准备。憎恨蒙蔽了我的双眼。如果我能让自己好好看清楚这个局面，我就会明白的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Carlisle Cullen. Looking at him without that hate clouding my eyes, I couldn't deny that killing him was murder. He was good. Good as any human we protected. Maybe better. The others, too, I supposed, but I didn't feel as strongly about them. I didn't know them as well. It was Carlisle who would hate fighting back, even to save his own life. That's why we would be able to kill him -- because he wouldn't want us, his enemies, to die.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡莱尔·卡伦。抛开憎恨的阴霾来看他的话，我不能否认消灭他等同于谋杀犯罪。他是个好人，和我们要保护的人类一样的善良，也许更慈悲为怀。其他人也一样。我对其他人没有这么强烈的感情，因为我也不了解他们。即使是为了自卫，卡莱尔都不愿意以牙还牙。这就是我们能够杀了他的原因，因为他不想我们——他的敌人——死去。">查看中文翻译</div>
