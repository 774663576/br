<div class="line_en">In the low-ceilinged canteen, deep under ground, the lunch queue jerked slowly forward. The room was already very full and deafeningly noisy. From the grille at the counter the steam of stew came pouring forth, with a sour metallic smell which did not quite overcome the fumes of Victory Gin. On the far side of the room there was a small bar, a mere hole in the wall, where gin could be bought at ten cents the large nip.</div>

<div class="line_en">He turned round. It was his friend Syme, who worked in the Research Department. Perhaps "friend" was not exactly the right word. You did not have friends nowadays, you had comrades: but there were some comrades whose society was pleasanter than that of others. Syme was a philologist, a specialist in Newspeak. Indeed, he was one of the enormous team of experts now engaged in compiling the Eleventh Edition of the Newspeak Dictionary. He was a tiny creature, smaller than Winston, with dark hair and large, protuberant eyes, at once mournful and derisive, which seemed to search your face closely while he was speaking to you.</div>

At any given moment there was some necessary article which the Party shops were unable to supply. Sometimes it was buttons, sometimes it was darning wool, sometimes it was shoelaces; at present it was razor blades. You could only get hold of them, if at all, by scrounging more or less furtively on the "free" market.</div>

<div class="line_en">His mocking eyes roved over Winston's face. "I know you," the eyes seemed to say, "I see through you. I know very well why you didn't go to see those prisoners hanged." In an intellectual way, Syme was venomously orthodox. He would talk with a disagreeable gloating satisfaction of helicopter raids on enemy villages, the trials and confessions of thought-criminals, the executions in the cellars of the Ministry of Love. Talking to him was largely a matter of getting him away from such subjects and entangling him, if possible, in the technicalities of Newspeak, on which he was authoritative and interesting. Winston turned his head a little aside to avoid the scrutiny of the large dark eyes.</div>

<div class="line_en">Winston and Syme pushed their trays beneath the grille. Onto each was dumped swiftly the regulation lunch -- a metal pannikin of pinkish-grey stew, a hunk of bread, a cube of cheese, a mug of milkless Victory Coffee, and one saccharine tablet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="温斯顿和赛姆将他们的托盘放在格栅下面。工人往他们的盘子里飞快地打了一份规定的午餐——一小碗雪青色的炖菜、一大片面包、一小块奶酪、一杯不加牛奶的胜利咖啡，还有一片糖精。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The gin was served out to them in handleless china mugs. They threaded their way across the crowded room and unpacked their trays onto the metal-topped table, on one corner of which someone had left a pool of stew, a filthy liquid mess that had the appearance of vomit. Winston took up his mug of gin, paused for an instant to collect his nerve, and gulped the oily-tasting stuff down. When he had winked the tears out of his eyes he suddenly discovered that he was hungry. He began swallowing spoonfuls of the stew, which, in among its general sloppiness, had cubes of spongy pinkish stuff which was probably a preparation of meat. Neither of them spoke again till they had emptied their pannikins. From the table at Winston's left, a little behind his back, someone was talking rapidly and continuously, a harsh gabble almost like the quacking of a duck, which pierced the general uproar of the room.</div>

When we've finished with it, people like you will have to learn it all over again. You think, I dare say, that our chief job is inventing new words. But not a bit of it!

<div class="line_en">"It's a beautiful thing, the destruction of words. Of course the great wastage is in the verbs and adjectives, but there are hundreds of nouns that can be got rid of as well. It isn't only the synonyms; there are also the antonyms. After all, what justification is there for a word which is simply the opposite of some other word? A word contains its opposite in itself. Take 'good', for instance. If you have a word like 'good', what need is there for a word like 'bad'? 'Ungood' will do just as well -- better, because it's an exact opposite, which the other is not. Or again, if you want a stronger version of 'good', what sense is there in having a whole string of vague useless words like 'excellent' and 'splendid' and all the rest of them? 'Plusgood' covers the meaning; or 'doubleplusgood' if you want something stronger still. Of course we use those forms already, but in the final version of Newspeak there'll be nothing else. In the end the whole notion of goodness and badness will be covered by only six words -- in reality, only one word. Don't you see the beauty of that, Winston? It was B. B.'s idea originally, of course," he added as an afterthought.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“破坏词语是一件很美好的事情。当然，损失最大的是动词和形容词，但数以百计的名词也得被清除掉。要清除的不仅是同义词，还包括反义词。毕竟，一个词只是另一个词的反义，这有何存在的必要呢？一个词本身就包含了它的反面。以‘好’为例，如果你有了像‘好’这样一个词，为什么还要‘坏’这样一个词呢？‘不好’具有同样的作用——而且效果更好，因为这是一个确切的反义词，而另一个则不是。再比如，你要表达比‘好’更强烈的意义，有必要列出一串含混无用的词来吗？如‘优秀’、‘极佳’之类。‘加好’就能包含这些词的意义了；或者你要进一步表达强烈的意义，那就用‘双加好’‘倍加好’。当然，我们已经用这些新词了，但在新语的最后版本中，不再有其他的词。最终，好与坏的整个概念将由六个词来涵盖——其实只有一个词。你难道不觉得这很美吗，温斯顿？当然，这原是老大的创意。”他像是想起来似的加上一句。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You haven't a real appreciation of Newspeak, Winston," he said almost sadly. "Even when you write it you're still thinking in Oldspeak. I've read some of those pieces that you write in the Times occasionally. They're good enough, but they're translations. In your heart you'd prefer to stick to Oldspeak, with all its vagueness and its useless shades of meaning. You don't grasp the beauty of the destruction of words. Do you know that Newspeak is the only language in the world whose vocabulary gets smaller every year?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你对新语还没有真正地欣赏，温斯顿，”他几乎语带哀伤地说。“甚至当你用新语写作时，你仍然用旧语思考。我读过你在《泰晤士报》上偶尔写的几篇文章。文章写得不错，但像是翻译体。在你内心，你还是留恋旧语，因而表达含混不清，辞不达意。你领会不到破坏词语的美妙。你知道新语是世界上唯一其词汇量逐步缩小的语言吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Don't you see that the whole aim of Newspeak is to narrow the range of thought? In the end we shall make thoughtcrime literally impossible, because there will be no words in which to express it. Every concept that can ever be needed will be expressed by exactly one word, with its meaning rigidly defined and all its subsidiary meanings rubbed out and forgotten. Already, in the Eleventh Edition, we're not far from that point. But the process will still be continuing long after you and I are dead. Every year fewer and fewer words, and the range of consciousness always a little smaller. Even now, of course, there's no reason or excuse for committing thought crime. It's merely a question of self-discipline, reality-control. But in the end there won't be any need even for that. The Revolution will be complete when the language is perfect. Newspeak is Ingsoc and Ingsoc is Newspeak," he added with a sort of mystical satisfaction. "Has it ever occurred to you, Winston, that by the year 2050, at the very latest, not a single human being will be alive who could understand such a conversation as we are having now?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"The proles are not human beings," he said carelessly. "By 2050 -- earlier, probably -- all real knowledge of Oldspeak will have disappeared. The whole literature of the past will have been destroyed. Chaucer, Shakespeare, Milton, Byron -- they'll exist only in Newspeak versions, not merely changed into something different, but actually changed into something contradictory of what they used to be. Even the literature of the Party will change. Even the slogans will change. How could you have a slogan like 'freedom is slavery' when the concept of freedom has been abolished? The whole climate of thought will be different. In fact there will be no thought, as we understand it now. Orthodoxy means not thinking -- not needing to think. Orthodoxy is unconsciousness."</div>

<div class="line_en">Winston had finished his bread and cheese. He turned a little sideways in his chair to drink his mug of coffee. At the table on his left the man with the strident voice was still talking remorselessly away. A young woman who was perhaps his secretary, and who was sitting with her back to Winston, was listening to him and seemed to be eagerly agreeing with everything that he said. From time to time Winston caught some such remark as "I think you're so right. I do so agree with you", uttered in a youthful and rather silly feminine voice. But the other voice never stopped for an instant, even when the girl was speaking. Winston knew the man by sight, though he knew no more about him than that he held some important post in the Fiction Department. He was a man of about thirty, with a muscular throat and a large, mobile mouth. His head was thrown back a little, and because of the angle at which he was sitting, his spectacles caught the light and presented to Winston two blank discs instead of eyes. What was slightly horrible was that from the stream of sound that poured out of his mouth, it was almost impossible to distinguish a single word. Just once Winston caught a phrase -- "complete and final elimination of Goldsteinism" -- jerked out very rapidly and, as it seemed, all in one piece, like a line of type cast solid. For the rest it was just a noise, a quack-quack-quacking. And yet, though you could not actually hear what the man was saying, you could not be in any doubt about its general nature. He might be denouncing Goldstein and demanding sterner measures against thought-criminals and saboteurs, he might be fulminating against the atrocities of the Eurasian army, he might be praising Big Brother or the heroes on the Malabar front -- it made no difference. Whatever it was, you could be certain that every word of it was pure orthodoxy, pure Ingsoc. As he watched the eyeless face with the jaw moving rapidly up and down, Winston had a curious feeling that this was not a real human being but some kind of dummy. It was not the man's brain that was speaking, it was his larynx. The stuff that was coming out of him consisted of words, but it was not speech in the true sense: it was a noise uttered in unconsciousness, like the quacking of a duck.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="温斯顿吃完了面包和奶酪。他在座位上略微侧过身来喝那杯咖啡。在他左边的那张桌子上，那个声音刺耳的人还在无休止地絮叨。一个年轻女子，也许是他的秘书，背朝温斯顿坐着，听着他说话，似乎对他所说的一切热切地表示赞同。温斯顿时不时地听到她说，“我想你说得很对。你的意见我很同意，”这女子的声音听起来显得年轻但相当不明事理。但另一个声音从不停歇片刻，即使在这个女孩说话的时候。温斯顿觉得这个人面熟，但只知道他在小说司担任某个重要职位。他是一个三十岁左右的男子，有着发达的喉头，一张灵巧的大嘴。他的脑袋稍稍向后仰着，因为他坐的角度，他的眼镜有反光，温斯顿看到的像是两张空白光盘，而不是他的双眼。让人觉得有点可怕的是，声音的洪流从他嘴里涌出，但几乎听不清一个词。只有一次温斯顿听明白了一个句子——“彻底并最终清除戈尔施泰因主义”——话说得很快，都挤在一起，像是浇铸成的。至于其他，则只是一种声音，呱呱—呱呱—呱呱。然而，虽然你实际上听不清这个男子在说什么，你无疑了解他说话的性质。他可能在抨击戈尔施泰因，主张对思想犯和破坏分子采取更严厉的措施，他可能在愤怒谴责欧亚国军队的残暴，他可能在赞美老大哥或马拉巴尔前线的英雄——这没有什么区别。无论他说什么，你可以肯定，他说的每一句话都绝对正统，绝对英社。当温斯顿看着他没有眼睛的脸，下巴飞快地上下移动，他有一种奇怪的感觉：这不是一个活人，而是某种人体模型。不是这个人的大脑在说话，而是他的喉头在说话。他说出来的话是由词语组成的，但又不是真正意义上的讲话：只是无意识发出的一种声音，就像一只鸭子呱呱叫。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Syme had fallen silent for a moment, and with the handle of his spoon was tracing patterns in the puddle of stew. The voice from the other table quacked rapidly on, easily audible in spite of the surrounding din.</div>

<div class="line_en">Unquestionably Syme will be vaporised, Winston thought again. He thought it with a kind of sadness, although well knowing that Syme despised him and slightly disliked him, and was fully capable of denouncing him as a thought-criminal if he saw any reason for doing so. There was something subtly wrong with Syme. There was something that he lacked: discretion, aloofness, a sort of saving stupidity. You could not say that he was unorthodox. He believed in the principles of Ingsoc, he venerated Big Brother, he rejoiced over victories, he hated heretics, not merely with sincerity but with a sort of restless zeal, an up-to-dateness of information, which the ordinary Party member did not approach. Yet a faint air of disreputability always clung to him. He said things that would have been better unsaid, he had read too many books, he frequented the Chestnut Tree Café, haunt of painters and musicians. There was no law, not even an unwritten law, against frequenting the Chestnut Tree Café, yet the place was somehow ill-omened. The old, discredited leaders of the Party had been used to gather there before they were finally purged. Goldstein himself, it was said, had sometimes been seen there, years and decades ago. Syme's fate was not difficult to foresee. And yet it was a fact that if Syme grasped, even for three seconds, the nature of his, Winston's, secret opinions, he would betray him instantly to the Thought Police. So would anybody else, for that matter: but Syme more than most. Zeal was not enough. Orthodoxy was unconsciousness.</div>

<div class="line_en">"There is a word in Newspeak," said Syme, "I don't know whether you know it: duckspeak, to quack like a duck. It is one of those interesting words that have two contradictory meanings. Applied to an opponent, it is abuse; applied to someone you agree with, it is praise."</div>

<div class="line_en">Something in the tone of his voice seemed to add, "that bloody fool." Parsons, Winston's fellow-tenant at Victory Mansions, was in fact threading his way across the room -- a tubby, middle-sized man with fair hair and a froglike face. At thirty-five he was already putting on rolls of fat at neck and waistline, but his movements were brisk and boyish. His whole appearance was that of a little boy grown large, so much so that although he was wearing the regulation overalls, it was almost impossible not to think of him as being dressed in the blue shorts, grey shirt and red neckerchief of the Spies. In visualising him one saw always a picture of dimpled knees and sleeves rolled back from pudgy forearms. Parsons did, indeed, invariably revert to shorts when a community hike or any other physical activity gave him an excuse for doing so. He greeted them both with a cheery "Hullo, hullo!" and sat down at the table, giving off an intense smell of sweat. Beads of moisture stood out all over his pink face. His powers of sweating were extraordinary. At the Community Centre you could always tell when he had been playing table-tennis by the dampness of the bat handle. Syme had produced a strip of paper on which there was a long column of words, and was studying it with an ink-pencil between his fingers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="听他说话的腔调像是说，“那是个大傻瓜。”帕森斯，这个温斯顿在胜利大厦的邻居，真的穿过大厅过来了。他是个肥胖、中等身材的男人，一头金发，有一张青蛙般的脸。才三十五岁，他的脖子和腰部已经长肉，但他动作轻快，有孩子气。他的整个外观像是一个长大的小男孩，所以，即使他穿着规定的工作服，但那模样让人不由得联想起他穿着少年侦察队的蓝短裤、灰衬衫，系着红领巾。一想到他的具体形象，就会出现这样一副画面：肉鼓鼓的膝盖、袖子卷起的短而粗的手臂。帕森斯确实一成不变地穿着短裤，无论是集体远足还是任何其他体育活动，他都乐于这么穿。他“哈啰、哈啰”地跟他们两个欢快地打招呼，在桌子旁坐下来，散发出一股强烈的汗臭。他粉红色的脸上满是汗珠子。他出汗的本领异乎寻常。在社区活动中心，你看到潮兮兮的乒乓球拍，就能猜到他什么时候来打过球。赛姆拿出一张纸，上面有好几行字，他手指夹着墨水笔研究起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The phrase "our new, happy life" recurred several times. It had been a favourite of late with the Ministry of Plenty. Parsons, his attention caught by the trumpet call, sat listening with a sort of gaping solemnity, a sort of edified boredom. He could not follow the figures, but he was aware that they were in some way a cause for satisfaction. He had lugged out a huge and filthy pipe which was already half full of charred tobacco. With the tobacco ration at a hundred grammes a week it was seldom possible to fill a pipe up to the top. Winston was smoking a Victory Cigarette which he held carefully horizontal. The new ration did not start till tomorrow and he had only four cigarettes left. For the moment he had shut his ears to the remoter noises and was listening to the stuff that streamed out of the telescreen. It appeared that there had even been demonstrations to thank Big Brother for raising the chocolate ration to twenty grammes a week. And only yesterday, he reflected, it had been announced that the ration was to be reduced to twenty grammes a week. Was it possible that they could swallow that, after only twenty-four hours? Yes, they swallowed it. Parsons swallowed it easily, with the stupidity of an animal. The eyeless creature at the other table swallowed it fanatically, passionately, with a furious desire to track down, denounce and vaporize anyone who should suggest that last week the ration had been thirty grammes. Syme, too -- in some more complex way, involving doublethink -- Syme swallowed it. Was he, then, alone in the possession of a memory?</div>

<div class="line_en">The fabulous statistics continued to pour out of the telescreen. As compared with last year there was more food, more clothes, more houses, more furniture, more cooking-pots, more fuel, more ships, more helicopters, more books, more babies -- more of everything except disease, crime and insanity. Year by year and minute by minute, everybody and everything was whizzing rapidly upwards. As Syme had done earlier, Winston had taken up his spoon and was dabbling in the pale-coloured gravy that dribbled across the table, drawing a long streak of it out into a pattern. He meditated resentfully on the physical texture of life. Had it always been like this? Had food always tasted like this? He looked round the canteen. A low-ceilinged, crowded room, its walls grimy from the contact of innumerable bodies; battered metal tables and chairs, placed so close together that you sat with elbows touching; bent spoons, dented trays, coarse white mugs; all surfaces greasy, grime in every crack; and a sourish, composite smell of bad gin and bad coffee and metallic stew and dirty clothes. Always in your stomach and in your skin there was a sort of protest, a feeling that you had been cheated of something that you had a right to. It was true that he had no memories of anything greatly different. In any time that he could accurately remember, there had never been quite enough to eat, one had never had socks or underclothes that were not full of holes, furniture had always been battered and rickety, rooms underheated, tube trains crowded, houses falling to pieces, bread dark-coloured, tea a rarity, coffee filthy-tasting, cigarettes insufficient -- nothing cheap and plentiful except synthetic gin. And though, of course, it grew worse as one's body aged, was it not a sign that this was not the natural order of things, if one's heart sickened at the discomfort and dirt and scarcity, the interminable winters, the stickiness of one's socks, the lifts that never worked, the cold water, the gritty soap, the cigarettes that came to pieces, the food with its strange evil tastes? Why should one feel it to be intolerable unless one had some kind of ancestral memory that things had once been different?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="难以置信的统计数字还在从电幕中倾泻而出。与去年相比，生产了更多的粮食、更多的布料、更多的住房、更多的家具、更多的锅子、更多的燃料、更多的船舶、更多的直升机、更多的书籍，也生了更多的孩子——除了疾病、犯罪和精神错乱，一切都有增长。年复一年，时时刻刻，每个人、每件事都在飞速成长。像赛姆先前做的，温斯顿拿起他的汤匙在泼在桌子上的淡淡汁水中划弄着，划出一条长痕形成图案。他满腹牢骚地想着生活的物质层面。难道生活一直如此吗？难道食物永远如此难吃吗？他朝餐厅扫了一眼。天花板很低，人很拥挤，墙上因长年使用沾满污垢，破旧不堪，桌椅紧挨着，坐下来就会互相碰着手肘。弯曲的汤匙、凹损的托盘、粗糙的白色杯子。所有的表面都是油腻腻的，每一条缝隙都是脏兮兮的。劣质的杜松子酒和咖啡，金属味的炖菜。肮脏的衣着散发出一股混浊的酸味。你的胃和你的皮肤都存有不满，感觉你被骗走了某件原本拥有的东西。确实，他对殊异的事物没有了任何记忆。无论何时，但凡是他能确切记得的，总是没有足够的食物可吃，袜子或内衣总是满是洞眼，家具总是破旧不堪和摇摇晃晃，房间总是暖气不足，地铁总是人满为患，房屋总是炸成碎片，面包总是黑乎乎的，茶叶总是很稀有，咖啡总是味道恶劣，香烟总是不够抽——没有什么是便宜和丰盛的，除了合成杜松子酒。虽然，随着年龄增长，这种状况会更加糟糕，但如果人们讨厌不适、肮脏和匮乏，讨厌没有尽头的冬天、黏乎乎的袜子、从不工作的电梯、冷水、粗肥皂、破碎的香烟和令人作呕的饭菜，那岂不是说明，这不是事物的自然状态？除非你有某种原始记忆，事物曾经并非如此，否则为什么会觉得这是不可忍受的呢？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He looked round the canteen again. Nearly everyone was ugly, and would still have been ugly even if dressed otherwise than in the uniform blue overalls. On the far side of the room, sitting at a table alone, a small, curiously beetle-like man was drinking a cup of coffee, his little eyes darting suspicious glances from side to side. How easy it was, thought Winston, if you did not look about you, to believe that the physical type set up by the Party as an ideal -- tall muscular youths and deep-bosomed maidens, blond-haired, vital, sunburnt, carefree -- existed and even predominated. Actually, so far as he could judge, the majority of people in Airstrip One were small, dark and ill-favoured. It was curious how that beetle-like type proliferated in the Ministries: little dumpy men, growing stout very early in life, with short legs, swift scuttling movements, and fat inscrutable faces with very small eyes. It was the type that seemed to flourish best under the dominion of the Party.</div>

Within two years those children would be denouncing her to the Thought Police. Mrs Parsons would be vaporized. Syme would be vaporised. Winston would be vaporized. O'Brien would be vaporised. Parsons, on the other hand, would never be vaporised. The eyeless creature with the quacking voice would never be vaporised. The little beetle-like men who scuttled so nimbly through the labyrinthine corridors of Ministries -- they, too, would never be vaporised.

<div class="line_en">His earlier thought returned to him: probably she was not actually a member of the Thought Police, but then it was precisely the amateur spy who was the greatest danger of all. He did not know how long she had been looking at him, but perhaps for as much as five minutes, and it was possible that his features had not been perfectly under control. It was terribly dangerous to let your thoughts wander when you were in any public place or within range of a telescreen. The smallest thing could give you away. A nervous tic, an unconscious look of anxiety, a habit of muttering to yourself -- anything that carried with it the suggestion of abnormality, of having something to hide. In any case, to wear an improper expression on your face (to look incredulous when a victory was announced, for example) was itself a punishable offence. There was even a word for it in Newspeak: facecrime, it was called.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他早先的想法又复活了：她实际上可能不是思想警察的一员，但业余侦探是最有危险性的。他不知道她注视他多久了，也许足足有五分钟，很有可能他的想法没有很好地得到控制。在公开场合或在电幕可及的范围内，让你的思想漫游是极危险的。最细小的事情也会将你泄露。神经质的一下抽搐、无意识的焦虑眼神、喃喃自语的习惯——以及任何这类涉及反常或企图掩饰的事情。不管怎样，脸上的不当表情（如当宣布胜利时的不信表情）本身就是要加以惩处的罪行。新语里甚至有一个词说明这种情况：脸罪。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At this moment he was dragged out of his reverie with a violent jerk. The girl at the next table had turned partly round and was looking at him. It was the girl with dark hair. She was looking at him in a sidelong way, but with curious intensity. The instant that she caught his eye she looked away again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此刻，他从沉思中突然惊醒。旁边桌子上那个女孩略微侧过身来，盯着他看。这就是那个黑发女孩。她用睨视的眼光看着他，但又出奇的专注。当他们的眼光相遇，她又看向了别处。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The sweat started out on Winston's backbone. A horrible pang of terror went through him. It was gone almost at once, but it left a sort of nagging uneasiness behind. Why was she watching him? Why did she keep following him about? Unfortunately he could not remember whether she had already been at that table when he arrived, or had come there after-wards. But yesterday, at any rate, during the Two Minutes Hate, she had sat immediately behind him when there was no apparent need to do so. Quite likely her real object had been to listen to him and make sure whether he was shouting loudly enough.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="汗开始从温斯顿的后背流下。一阵强烈的恐惧贯注全身。恐惧几乎很快就消失了，但留下了一种难忍的不安。她为什么注视他？她为什么总要跟着他？不幸的是，他不记得他来的时候她是已经在那张桌子旁了，还是之后来的。但至少是昨天，两分钟仇恨活动中，她马上就在他后面坐下，而没有明显的理由她得坐那儿。很可能她的真正目标是听着他，弄清楚他是否喊得响亮。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Did I ever tell you, old boy," he said, chuckling round the stem of his pipe, "about the time when those two nippers of mine set fire to the old market-woman's skirt because they saw her wrapping up sausages in a poster of B. B.? Sneaked up behind her and set fire to it with a box of matches. Burned her quite badly, I believe. Little beggars, eh? But keen as mustard! That's a first-rate training they give them in the Spies nowadays -- better than in my day, even. What d'you think's the latest thing they've served them out with? Ear trumpets for listening through key-holes! My little girl brought one home the other night -- tried it out on our sitting-room door, and reckoned she could hear twice as much as with her ear to the hole. Of course it's only a toy, mind you. Still, gives 'em the right idea, eh?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我曾告诉过你，老朋友，”他含着烟斗笑着说。“我的那两个小家伙在一个商场老妇人的裙子上点了火，因为他们见她用老大哥的宣传画包香肠。他们溜到她身后，用火柴点着了她的裙子。我想把她烧得够呛。两个小鬼，嗯？但极为热心！现在他们在少年侦察队里受到一流的训练——甚至比我那个时候受到的训练更好。你知道给他们配备的最新装备是什么？通过钥匙孔偷听的助听器！我的小女儿那天带了一只回家，想要安在我们客厅的门上，比她贴着钥匙孔听到的声音要大两倍。当然，这只是一件玩具，你别在意。不过他们的主意还不错，嗯？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At this moment the telescreen let out a piercing whistle. It was the signal to return to work. All three men sprang to their feet to join in the struggle round the lifts, and the remaining tobacco fell out of Winston's cigarette.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在这时候，电幕发出尖锐的哨子声。这是回去工作的信号。他们三个人都站起来去挤电梯。温斯顿烟头里的烟丝掉了下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The girl had turned her back on him again. Perhaps after all she was not really following him about; perhaps it was coincidence that she had sat so close to him two days running. His cigarette had gone out, and he laid it carefully on the edge of the table. He would finish smoking it after work, if he could keep the tobacco in it. Quite likely the person at the next table was a spy of the Thought Police, and quite likely he would be in the cellars of the Ministry of Love within three days, but a cigarette end must not be wasted. Syme had folded up his strip of paper and stowed it away in his pocket. Parsons had begun talking again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这女孩又背朝着他。也许她毕竟不是跟踪他，也许两天前她坐得离他很近只是巧合。他的烟熄灭了，他小心地将烟头放在桌子边。他干完活接着抽，如果里面还有烟丝的话。很可能旁边桌子的那个人是思想警察的一个侦探，很可能他三天之内会身处友爱部的地下室，但一个烟头也不能浪费掉。赛姆将纸折起来，放在口袋里。帕森斯又开始说起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
