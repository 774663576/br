<div class="line_en">Sansa was finishing her broth when he came the first time, entering through the back. She glimpsed him talking to his brother Osfryd. Then he climbed the dais and knelt beside the high seat, smelling of horse, four long thin scratches on his cheek crusted with scabs, his hair falling down past his collar and into his eyes. For all his whispering, Sansa could not help but hear. "The fleets are locked in battle. Some archers got ashore, but the Hound's cut them to pieces, Y'Grace. Your brother's raising his chain, I heard the signal. Some drunkards down to Flea Bottom are smashing doors and climbing through windows. Lord Bywater's sent the gold cloaks to deal with them. Baelor's Sept is jammed full, everyone praying."</div>

<div class="line_en">The torches shimmered brightly against the hammered metal of the wall sconces, filling the Queen's Ballroom with silvery light. Yet there was still darkness in that hall. Sansa could see it in the pale eyes of Ser Ilyn Payne, who stood by the back door still as stone, taking neither food nor wine. She could hear it in Lord Gyles's racking cough, and the whispered voice of Osney Kettleblack when he slipped in to bring Cersei the tidings.</div>

<div class="line_en">Cersei beckoned to her page for another cup of wine, a golden vintage from the Arbor, fruity and rich. The queen was drinking heavily, but the wine only seemed to make her more beautiful; her cheeks were flushed, and her eyes had a bright, feverish heat to them as she looked down over the hall. Eyes of wildfire, Sansa thought.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="瑟曦要侍童再拿一杯酒。这是青亭岛的上等金色葡萄酒，带果味的醇酿。太后喝了许多，愈喝愈是美丽。她脸颊绯红，俯视大厅的眼睛里有一种明亮而狂热的神色。一双燃烧着野火的眼睛，珊莎心想。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Musicians played, jugglers juggled. Moon Boy lurched about the hall on stilts making mock of everyone, while Ser Dontos chased serving girls on his broomstick horse. The guests laughed, but it was a joyless laughter, the sort of laughter that can turn into sobbing in half a heartbeat. Their bodies are here, but their thoughts are on the city walls, and their hearts as well.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="乐师们在演奏，杂耍艺人变戏法，月童踩着高跷在厅里摇摆走动，嘲笑在场每个人，而唐托斯爵士骑着扫帚马追逐年轻女仆。宾客们大声欢笑，却显得言不由衷，仿佛随时都能化为抽泣。他们人在这里，思绪和心灵却在城墙上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After the broth came a salad of apples, nuts, and raisins. At any other time, it might have made a tasty dish, but tonight all the food was flavored with fear. Sansa was not the only one in the hall without an appetite. Lord Gyles was coughing more than he was eating, Lollys Stokeworth sat hunched and shivering, and the young bride of one of Ser Lancel's knights began to weep uncontrollably. The queen commanded Maester Frenken to put her to bed with a cup of dreamwine. "Tears," she said scornfully to Sansa as the woman was led from the hall. "The woman's weapon, my lady mother used to call them. The man's weapon is a sword. And that tells us all you need to know, doesn't it?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="肉汤之后上了苹果、坚果和葡萄干拌的沙拉。其他任何时候，这都是一道美味，但在今晚，所有食物都添加了名叫恐惧的调料。厅里没胃口的远不止珊莎一人。盖尔斯伯爵咳嗽的时间比吃的时间多，洛丽丝·史铎克渥斯驼背坐着发抖，蓝赛尔爵士手下一名骑士的新娘不可遏抑地哭泣起来。太后命法兰肯学士给她一杯安眠酒，安排她上床睡觉。“眼泪，”女子被带离大厅后，她不屑地对珊莎说，“正如我母亲大人常说的那样，是女人的武器。刀剑则属于男人。这说明了一切，不是吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Jaime told me once that he only feels truly alive in battle and in bed." She lifted her cup and took a long swallow. Her salad was untouched. "I would sooner face any number of swords than sit helpless like this, pretending to enjoy the company of this flock of frightened hens."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“詹姆曾对我说，只有在战场和床上，他才能感觉自己的生命。”她举起酒杯，喝下一大口，面前的沙拉一点没碰。“我宁可面对亿万刀剑，也胜过无助地坐在这里，假装乐意跟这群受惊的母鸡为伴。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Certain things are expected of a queen. They will be expected of you should you ever wed Joffrey. Best learn." The queen studied the wives, daughters, and mothers who filled the benches. "Of themselves the hens are nothing, but their cocks are important for one reason or another, and some may survive this battle. So it behooves me to give their women my protection. If my wretched dwarf of a brother should somehow manage to prevail, they will return to their husbands and fathers full of tales about how brave I was, how my courage inspired them and lifted their spirits, how I never doubted our victory even for a moment."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这是当然，身为太后，就得做这种事。将来，你若跟乔佛里结婚，迟早也会明白这个道理。趁现在好好学一学吧。”太后打量坐满长凳的妻子、女儿和母亲们。“这些母鸡本身一钱不值，但和她们同群的公鸡是当下的关键，其中有些还会从战斗中生还，所以我必须为他们的女人提供保护。若我那可恶的侏儒弟弟侥幸成功，她们就会回到丈夫和父亲身边，宣传各种故事，说我如何勇敢，如何坚强，如何激励她们的士气。说我如何坚定不移，从无片刻疑虑。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“要城堡陷落吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You'd like that, wouldn't you?" Cersei did not wait for a denial. "If I'm not betrayed by my own guards, I may be able to hold here for a time. Then I can go to the walls and offer to yield to Lord Stannis in person. That will spare us the worst. But if Maegor's Holdfast should fall before Stannis can come up, why then, most of my guests are in for a bit of rape, I'd say. And you should never rule out mutilation, torture, and murder at times like these."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你就希望那样，对不对？”瑟曦不等她否认，续道，“如果不被卫兵出卖，我或能在此坚守一时，等待史坦尼斯公爵到来，以登城向他请降，避免最糟的情形。但若他抵达之前，梅葛楼就告陷落，那样的话，我敢说在座诸位都得忍受一点强暴。非常时刻，虐待、奸淫和拷打是谁也管不了的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Their birth protects them," Cersei admitted, "though not as much as you'd think. Each one's worth a good ransom, but after the madness of battle, soldiers often seem to want flesh more than coin. Even so, a golden shield is better than none. Out in the streets, the women won't be treated near as tenderly. Nor will our servants. Pretty things like that serving wench of Lady Tanda's could be in for a lively night, but don't imagine the old and the infirm and the ugly will be spared. Enough drink will make blind washerwomen and reeking pig girls seem as comely as you, sweetling.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“出身会提供保护，”瑟曦承认，“但没你想象的那么多。虽然她们每个都值一大笔赎金，但经过疯狂的战斗后，士兵们对血肉娇躯往往比钱财更感兴趣。其实她们应该庆幸，有金子当盾牌总比什么都没有好。街上那些女人会受到更粗暴的对待，我们的女仆们也一样，像坦妲小姐的侍女这样的漂亮妞会被玩上一整夜。对了，亲爱的，千万不要以为年老色衰或天生丑陋的就会被放过，灌下几杯烈酒，瞎眼的洗衣妇和臭烘烘的猪圈小妹就跟你一样标致。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sansa was spared the need to reply when two Kettleblacks reentered the hall. Ser Osmund and his brothers had become great favorites about the castle; they were always ready with a smile and a jest, and got on with grooms and huntsmen as well as they did with knights and squires. With the serving wenches they got on best of all, it was gossiped. Of late Ser Osmund had taken Sandor Clegane's place by Joffrey's side, and Sansa had heard the women at the washing well saying he was as strong as the Hound, only younger and faster. If that was so, she wondered why she had never once heard of these Kettleblacks before Ser Osmund was named to the Kingsguard.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="珊莎正不知如何回答，两个凯特布莱克又走进厅里。这两个弟弟和奥斯蒙爵士一样，在城堡很得人缘，他们总是面带微笑，俏皮话信手拈来，不论跟骑士、侍从还是马夫、猎人都很合拍，而且最得女仆们的青睐。如今奥斯蒙爵士取代了桑铎·克里冈在乔佛里身边的位置，井边的洗衣妇们聊天时说他跟猎狗一样强壮，但更年轻，反应更快。要真这样，为什么在奥斯蒙爵士当上御林铁卫之前，她从没听过凯特布莱克这个姓呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Try not to sound so like a mouse, Sansa. You're a woman now, remember? And betrothed to my firstborn." The queen sipped at her wine. "Were it anyone else outside the gates, I might hope to beguile him. But this is Stannis Baratheon. I'd have a better chance of seducing his horse." She noticed the look on Sansa's face, and laughed. "Have I shocked you, my lady?" She leaned close. "You little fool. Tears are not a woman's only weapon. You've got another one between your legs, and you'd best learn to use it. You'll find men use their swords freely enough. Both kinds of swords."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“别像只老鼠一样咋咋唬唬，珊莎。你已经是女人了，明白吗？你还是我长子的未婚妻。”太后啜一口酒。“城下换作别人，我还能试试去哄他，但这是史坦尼斯·拜拉席恩，我不如去哄他的马！”她注意到珊莎的表情，轻笑失声。“我吓到你了，亲爱的小姐？”她倾身靠近。“你这小傻瓜，眼泪并不是女人惟一的武器，你两腿之间还有一件，最好学会用它。一旦学成，自有男人主动为你使剑。两种剑都免费。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="奥斯佛利长长的黑发上戴了一顶钢制半盔，表情阴郁，“陛下，”他平静地说，“小伙子们逮到一个马夫和两个女仆，他们偷了三匹国王的马，想溜出边门。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"The night's first traitors," the queen said, "but not the last, I fear. Have Ser Ilyn see to them, and put their heads on pikes outside the stables as a warning." As they left, she turned to Sansa. "Another lesson you should learn, if you hope to sit beside my son. Be gentle on a night like this and you'll have treasons popping up all about you like mushrooms after a hard rain. The only way to keep your people loyal is to make certain they fear you more than they do the enemy."</div>

<div class="line_en">Crabclaw pies followed the salad. Then came mutton roasted with leeks and carrots, served in trenchers of hollowed bread. Lollys ate too fast, got sick, and retched all over herself and her sister. Lord Gyles coughed, drank, coughed, drank, and passed out. The queen gazed down in disgust to where he sprawled with his face in his trencher and his hand in a puddle of wine. "The gods must have been mad to waste manhood on the likes of him, and I must have been mad to demand his release."</div>

<div class="line_en">The queen's face was hard and angry. "Would that I could take a sword to their necks myself." Her voice was starting to slur. "When we were little, Jaime and I were so much alike that even our lord father could not tell us apart. Sometimes as a lark we would dress in each other's clothes and spend a whole day each as the other. Yet even so, when Jaime was given his first sword, there was none for me. 'What do I get?' I remember asking. We were so much alike, I could never understand why they treated us so differently. Jaime learned to fight with sword and lance and mace, while I was taught to smile and sing and please. He was heir to Casterly Rock, while I was to be sold to some stranger like a horse, to be ridden whenever my new owner liked, beaten whenever he liked, and cast aside in time for a younger filly. Jaime's lot was to be glory and power, while mine was birth and moonblood."</div>

<div class="line_en">After the meal had been cleared away, many of the guests asked leave to go to the sept. Cersei graciously granted their request. Lady Tanda and her daughters were among those who fled. For those who remained, a singer was brought forth to fill the hall with the sweet music of the high harp. He sang of Jonquil and Florian, of Prince Aemon the Dragonknight and his love for his brother's queen, of Nymeria's ten thousand ships. They were beautiful songs, but terribly sad. Several of the women began to weep, and Sansa felt her own eyes growing moist.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="食物清走之后，众宾客纷纷请求去圣堂祈祷，瑟曦慈蔼地一一批准。坦妲伯爵夫人和她的女儿们也在其中。一个歌手被带进来，为留下的人弹奏古竖琴，甜蜜的乐声填满大厅。他歌颂琼琪和佛罗理安，歌颂龙骑士伊蒙王子和他对兄嫂之爱，歌颂娜梅莉亚的万船横渡。歌谣虽然美丽，却又充满悲伤，让在场的女人忍不住落泪，珊莎的眼睛也渐渐湿润。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Very good, dear." The queen leaned close. "You want to practice those tears. You'll need them for King Stannis."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh, spare me your hollow courtesies. Matters must have reached a desperate strait out there if they need a dwarf to lead them, so you might as well take off your mask. I know all about your little treasons in the godswood."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“噢，饶了我吧，省省这套装模作样的鬼把戏。战况若非绝望，是轮不到侏儒出战的。好了，你也摘下面具，我对你在神木林里那些小小的叛国行径可是了若指掌。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"The godswood?" Don't look at Ser Dontos, don't, don't, Sansa told herself. She doesn't know, no one knows, Dontos promised me, my Florian would never fail me. "I've done no treasons. I only visit the godswood to pray."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“神木林？”别看唐托斯爵士，别看，别看，珊莎告诉自己，她不知道，没人知道，唐托斯向我保证过，我的佛罗理安不会让我失望。“我没有叛国，只是去祈祷。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"For Stannis. Or your brother, it's all the same. Why else seek your father's gods? You're praying for our defeat. What would you call that, if not treason?"</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我为乔佛里祈祷，”她紧张地坚持。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Why, because he treats you so sweetly?" The queen took a flagon of sweet plum wine from a passing serving girl and filled Sansa's cup. "Drink," she commanded coldly. "Perhaps it will give you the courage to deal with truth for a change."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“为什么？为他对你的爱？”太后从经过的女侍手中拿过一壶甜李子酒，倒满珊莎的杯子。“喝，”她冷冷地下令，“但愿它给你勇气，迎接即将到来的事实。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"More?" Cersei asked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“再来？”瑟曦问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She did not dare answer, but it did not matter. The queen raised a hand and beckoned, never waiting for a reply. Sansa had not even seen Ser Ilyn return to the hall, but suddenly there he was, striding from the shadows behind the dais as silent as a cat. He carried Ice unsheathed. Her father had always cleaned the blade in the godswood after he took a man's head, Sansa recalled, but Ser Ilyn was not so fastidious. There was blood drying on the rippling steel, the red already fading to brown. "Tell Lady Sansa why I keep you by us," said Cersei.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她不敢回答，但无所谓，太后根本没理她，便举手招呼。先前珊莎没见伊林爵士回来，但他就那么突然出现了，大步从高台后的阴影里跨出，如猫一样安静，手提出鞘的寒冰。记得父亲每次取人性命后，都会去神木林里将这把剑洗干净，但伊林爵士没那么讲究，泛着涟漪的瓦雷利亚钢剑上沾有逐渐凝固的鲜血，红色蜕为褐色。“告诉珊莎小姐，我为何让你留在这里，”瑟曦命令。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No. Please."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不行了。求求您。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sansa lifted the cup to her lips and took a sip. The wine was cloyingly sweet, but very strong.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="珊莎把杯子举到唇边，啜了一小口。酒甜得发腻，非常烈。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You can do better than that," Cersei said. "Drain the cup, Sansa. Your queen commands you." it almost gagged her, but Sansa emptied the cup, gulping down the thick sweet wine until her head was swimming.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你能做得更好，”瑟曦道，“干了它，珊莎，这是太后的命令。”珊莎差点噎着，但勉强喝完一杯，黏稠甜腻的酒下肚，脑袋开始晕眩。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The queen looked displeased. "When you asked about Ser Ilyn earlier, I lied to you. Would you like to hear the truth, Sansa? Would you like to know why he's really here?"</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“没错。所以我奉劝你更换祷词，珊莎，祈求另一个结局。我向你保证，兰尼斯特家族若是倒台，史塔克家也不会高兴。”她伸出手，轻轻地将珊莎的头发从脖子上拨开。">查看中文翻译</div>
