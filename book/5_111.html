<div class="line_en">From the second they got home, Marah seemed to sense that something was wrong with Daddy, and no amount of cuddling could comfort her. More often than not, she woke screaming in the middle of the night and wouldn't fall silent until Kate brought her into bed with them (a practice which made Mom roll her eyes, light a smoke, and say, "You'll be sorry.")</div>

<div class="line_en">As bad as that year was, Kate knew every moment that it could have been so much worse. The man she brought home from Germany bore only the merest resemblance to her husband in those first few months. His brain was slow in healing, and sometimes he lost patience with himself when a word outran him or an idea couldn't be latched on to. She spent endless hours with him in rehab, both working with him and his physical therapist and waiting in the lobby with Marah.</div>

<div class="line_en">All around them, people were talking and singing. Aunt Georgia was doing "The Time Warp" with Sean, his girlfriend, and Uncle Ralph. Mom and Dad were talking to Tully, who was swaying to the music with Marah in her arms.</div>

<div class="line_en">Every time Kate saw a new hairdo, she winced at how fast time was moving. The years weren't just passing, they were flying by. Already it was the last day of August, 1997. In a little more than a week her baby would be starting second grade.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="每当凯蒂看到新发型，总会因为时间过得太快而心惊。一年接着一年过去了，不是慢慢走过，而是高速飞驰。现在已经是1997年8月，再过几天她的小宝贝就要上二年级了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">During college, the cherry trees in the Quad had marked the passing of time. Every season came and went on those spindly gray-brown branches. In the eighties, time had been marked by the streetlamps on the cobblestoned street in front of the Public Market. When the first SEASON'S GREETINGS flag fluttered beneath the lamps, she knew another year had gone by.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the nineties it was Tully's hair. Every morning, while Kate fed and bathed Marah, she watched the morning show on TV. Like clockwork, Tully's hairdos changed twice a year. First there had been the Jane Pauley extra-short bangs, then the Meg Ryan messy look, then the pixie cut that made her look impossibly young, and most recently, she'd chosen the most talked-about cut in the country -- the Rachel.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="90年代则是塔莉的发型。每天早上，当凯蒂喂玛拉吃饭、帮她洗澡，总会顺便收看晨间新闻。塔莉固定一年换两次发型，头三次都是珍·保利的极短刘海样式，然后换成梅格·瑞恩随性凌乱的造型，接着小妖精风的短发带给她不可思议的青春气息，最近她选了国内最热门的发型——模仿影集《老友记》中的瑞秋。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="虽然很不想承认，但她殷切盼望着开学日。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But as the months turned into years, she'd begun to feel a tiny itch of dissatisfaction. At first she'd kept it bottled inside of her -- after all, what did she have to complain about? She loved her life. She spent what spare hours she did have volunteering in the classroom and at Helper House, the local center that provided assistance to women in need. She even took a few art classes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="随着光阴累积成月，再累积为年，她隐隐感觉到一丝不满足。一开始她只是压抑，毕竟她没什么好抱怨的，她热爱这样的生活。有空闲时间她就去学校当义工，或是去当地的妇女救援机构帮忙，甚至上课学作画。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For the past seven years, she'd been the best mother she knew how to be. She'd diligently recorded every milestone in Marah's baby album and took enough photographs to scientifically document a new life-form. More than that, she enjoyed her daughter so much that she sometimes felt lost in the sea of love that surrounded them. She and Johnny had tried for years to conceive another child, but they had not been so blessed. It had been difficult for Kate to handle; in time, though, she'd accepted her small family and poured herself into making every moment perfect. Finally, she'd found something she was passionate about: motherhood.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="过去七年来，她尽一切所能当个好妈妈。她欢喜记录玛拉成长的重大时刻，相簿中的照片数量之多，简直像观察新物种的生态记录。不止如此，女儿带给她如此多的喜悦，以至于有时候她感觉仿佛迷失在爱的汪洋中。她和强尼一直努力想再生一个孩子，但始终没有成功，虽然凯蒂觉得遗憾，但她渐渐接受这样的家庭规模，努力让每个时刻都完美无缺。她终于找到能够热衷投入的事业了：当妈妈。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Shaking her head, she turned away from the view and went to the television, turning it on. As soon as Marah woke up, she was going to make her daughter march outside and pick up the toys. A temper tantrum was sure to follow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她摇头离开窗前，走到一旁打开电视。等玛拉起床，她会立刻叫她出去收拾，可想而知女儿一定会闹脾气。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It wasn't enough, didn't fill the invisible void, but it made her feel productive and useful. And though the people who loved her -- Johnny, Tully, and Mom -- repeatedly commented that she seemed to be looking for something more, she ignored them all. It was so much easier to focus on the present, on her daughter. There would be plenty of time later on to search for herself.</div>

<div class="line_en">The television came on with a thump. A BREAKING NEWS banner ran beneath Bernard Shaw's grave face.
