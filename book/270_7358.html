<div class="line_en">Edward, silent through our little argument, flashed her a warning look. She stuck out her tongue at him. She was right -- her soft voice would never carry over the babble of the cafeteria. And no one would understand the meaning behind her words in any case.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱德华在我们短暂的争辩中一直没有说话，他飞快地瞟了她一眼以示警告。她对他吐了吐舌头，她是对的——她轻柔的声音从来都不会被食堂里叽叽咕咕的声音所掩盖。不管怎么样，没有人会理解她话里的含义。">查看中文翻译</div>

Carlisle's trying to track down a few old friends, and Jasper is looking up Peter and Charlotte. He's considering talking to Maria… but no one really wants to involve the southerners."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱德华低声地说道：“贾斯帕认为我们可以利用一些帮助，坦妮娅的家人并不是我们唯一的选择。卡莱尔正在努力寻找几个老朋友，贾斯帕也在寻找彼得和夏洛特。他也考虑与玛丽亚谈一谈……但是没有人愿意搅和到南方人的事情之中。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"When are you going?" I asked in a hollow voice. I couldn't stand this -- the idea that someone might not come back. What if it was Emmett, so brave and thoughtless that he was never the least bit cautious? Or Esme, so sweet and motherly that I couldn't even imagine her in a fight? Or Alice, so tiny, so fragile-looking? Or… but I couldn't even think the name, consider the possibility.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你什么时候去？”我语气空洞地问道。我无法忍受这样——某个人可能不会回来的想法。如果是埃美特呢，他那么勇敢，那么粗心大意，从来不会多一点点谨慎的？或者是埃斯梅，她那么和蔼，就像母亲一样，我甚至无法想象她打仗的样子？或者是爱丽丝，那么娇小玲珑，一副弱不禁风的样子？或者……但是我根本不敢去想他的名字，考虑那种可能性。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="接着我想到了什么。或许我不必袖手旁观，一个星期的时间足够了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I looked only at her as I answered. My voice was just slightly louder than a whisper. "I could help."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我回答的时候只是看着她。我的声音只不过比耳语稍微大了一点儿：“我能帮忙的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But it was Alice, still calm, who answered. "That really wouldn't be helpful."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是爱丽丝，仍然很冷静地回答了我的话：“那可真的不会帮上忙。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Why not?" I argued; I could hear the desperation in my voice. "Eight is better than seven. There's more than enough time."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“为什么不会？”我争辩道，我能听见我声音绝望的语气，“八个要比七个好，那不仅仅是有足够的时间啊。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"There's not enough time to make you helpful, Bella," she disagreed coolly. "Do you remember how Jasper described the young ones? You'd be no good in a fight. You wouldn't be able to control your instincts, and that would make you an easy target. And then Edward would get hurt trying to protect you." She folded her arms across her chest, pleased with her unassailable logic.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不会有足够的时间让你对我们有所帮助，贝拉。”她冷冷地否定道，“你还记得贾斯帕是怎么给你描述那些新生的吸血鬼的吗？打仗的时候你可不会起什么作用。你将不能控制自己的本能，那会使你成为轻而易举就能打倒的靶子，到那时候爱德华为了保护你就会受伤。”她双臂环抱在胸前，言语中的逻辑无可争辩。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And I knew she was right, when she put it like that. I slumped in my seat, my sudden hope defeated. Beside me, Edward relaxed.</div>

<div class="line_en">The message light was flashing when I got home. My feeling of relief flared again as I listened to my mother describe Phil's accident on the ball field -- while demonstrating a slide, he'd tangled up with the catcher and broken his thigh bone; he was entirely dependent on her, and there was no way she could leave him. My mom was still apologizing when the message cut off.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我回家的时候留言提示灯在闪烁。欣慰再一次油然而生，我听着妈妈描述菲尔在棒球场上发生了事故——当他示范滑垒时与接球手撞作一团，摔断了大腿；现在他完全依靠她，她根本无法离开他。留言快结束的时候，我妈妈还在道歉。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他微笑道：“这是信心。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Wonderful," I grumbled. I picked up the phone and dialed Renee's number. I knew it would be a long conversation, but I also knew that I wouldn't have to contribute much.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好极了。”我不满地说道。我拿起电话，拨了蕾妮的电话。我知道这次谈话会很长，而且我也知道我不会说太多话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I just listened, and reassured her every time I could get a word in: I wasn't disappointed, I wasn't mad, I wasn't hurt. She should concentrate on helping Phil get better. I passed on my "get well soon" to Phil, and promised to call her with every single detail from Forks High's generic graduation. Finally, I had to use my desperate need to study for finals to get off the phone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我只是听着，每次我能插话的时候都会宽慰她：我不失望，我不生气，我不受伤。她应该集中精力帮助菲尔康复，我让她转告菲尔“早日康复”，答应打电话一字不漏地告诉她福克斯高中一年一度毕业典礼的点点滴滴。最后，我不得不用急于期末复习的借口才挂断电话。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Edward's patience was endless. He waited politely through the whole conversation, just playing with my hair and smiling whenever I looked up. It was probably superficial to notice such things while I had so many more important things to think about, but his smile still knocked the breath out of me. He was so beautiful that it made it hard sometimes to think about anything else, hard to concentrate on Phil's troubles or Renee's apologies or hostile vampire armies. I was only human.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱德华的耐心永无止境。他礼貌地等待着我们谈完话，只是把玩着我的头发，每次当我抬头的时候都看见他在微笑。或许当我还有那么多更重要的事情需要考虑的时候注意到这样的事情很肤浅，但是他的微笑总能令我屏气敛息。他美丽得让人有时难以思考其他事情，难以专注于菲尔的问题，或蕾妮的歉意，还有心怀敌意的吸血鬼军队，我只是个凡人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes," he finally said. "Human blood makes us the strongest, though only fractionally. Jasper's been thinking about cheating -- adverse as he is to the idea, he's nothing if not practical -- but he won't suggest it. He knows what Carlisle will say."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，”他终于开口说道，“人类血液使我们变得最为强壮，尽管只是极少这样。贾斯帕在考虑瞒天过海——尽管他也讨厌这样，他只不过是考虑到实际情况而已——不过他不会提出这样的建议，他知道卡莱尔会怎么说。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He changed the subject again. "That's why they're so strong, of course. The newborns are full of human blood -- their own blood, reacting to the change. It lingers in the tissues and strengthens them. Their bodies use it up slowly, like Jasper said, the strength starting to wane after about a year."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他又换了个话题：“当然啦，那就是他们为什么这么强大的原因。新生儿体内充满了人类血液——他们自己的血液，对变化的自然反应，这些血液残留在他们的组织里，使他们变得强大起来。他们的身体会慢慢地耗尽自己的血液，正如贾斯帕所说，大概在一年左右这种力量开始衰退。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Though it was the middle of the afternoon, my call woke Jacob up, and he was grouchy at first. He cheered right up when I asked if I could visit the next day. The Quileute school was already out for the summer, so he told me to come over as early as I could. I was pleased to have an option besides being babysat. There was a tiny bit more dignity in spending the day with Jacob.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尽管已经是下午两三点钟，我的电话还是吵醒了雅各布，他起初还满腹牢骚。当我问他第二天我是否可以拜访他的时候，他立即高兴起来。奎鲁特学校已经放暑假了，所以他让我尽早过去。我很高兴除了被当小孩子保护起来以外，我还有别的选择，与雅各布玩一天会稍微有一点儿尊严。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then I sighed and hopped down from the counter, because I really couldn't put it off any longer. I had to cram, and cram hard. Luckily I had Edward's help, and Edward was an excellent tutor -- since he knew absolutely everything. I figured my biggest problem would be just focusing on the tests. If I didn't watch myself, I might end up writing my History essay on the vampire wars of the South.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着我叹了口气，从灶台上跳了下来，因为我真的不想再推迟了。我得临时抱佛脚了，而且还要抱得紧紧的。幸亏我有爱德华帮忙，他是个优秀的辅导老师——因为他绝对是无所不知。我想我最大的问题只是把注意力放在考试上面，如果我稍不留心，说不定我在历史考试的作文题上会写出南方的吸血鬼战争呢。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">If I were thinking practically, I knew it made more sense to ask Carlisle to change me the second I made it through the graduation line. Forks was becoming nearly as dangerous as a war zone. No, Forks was a war zone. Not to mention… it would be a good excuse to miss the graduation party. I smiled to myself as I thought of that most trivial of reasons for changing. Silly… yet still compelling.</div>

<div class="line_en">But I knew he was going to stick to his marriage scheme like glue -- because a delay was what he was clearly after and it was working so far. I tried to imagine telling my parents that I was getting married this summer. Telling Angela and Ben and Mike. I couldn't. I couldn't think of the words to say. It would be easier to tell them I was becoming a vampire. And I was sure that at least my mother -- were I to tell her every detail of the truth -- would be more strenuously opposed to me getting married than to me a becoming vampire. I grimaced to myself as I imagined her horrified expression.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是我知道他会像胶水一样坚持结婚计划的——因为延期显然就是他所追求的目标，到目前为止还是很有效的。我试图想象着告诉父母这个夏天我就要结婚了，告诉安吉拉、本还有迈克。我不能，我想不出该说什么话，这不会比告诉他们我要成为吸血鬼更容易些。而且我确定至少我母亲——要是我告诉她事情的来龙去脉的话——会比反对我变成吸血鬼更极力地反对我结婚的，我一想到她那惊恐万状的表情就独自苦笑起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And I didn't want to be practical. I wanted Edward to be the one. It wasn't a rational desire.

So it shouldn't make a difference.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="而且我不想很务实，我想爱德华是那个人，这不是一个合理的决定。我确定——在某个人实际上咬了我大概两秒钟之后，毒液开始在我的血管里燃烧、流淌——我真的不会在意是谁做的，所以不应该有什么不同。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was hard to define, even to myself, why it mattered. There was just something about him being the one to make the choice -- to want to keep me enough that he wouldn't just allow me to be changed, he would act to keep me. It was childish, but I liked the idea that his lips would be the last good thing I would feel. Even more embarrassingly, something I would never say aloud, I wanted his venom to poison my system. It would make me belong to him in a tangible, quantifiable way.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="为什么这很重要，甚至对我自己而言都很难说清楚。这只是与他是那个作选择的人有关——他想要守护着我，这足以让他不许我被改变，他会采取行动维持我的现状的。这很孩子气，但是他的嘴唇是我会感觉到的最后一件美好的事情，我喜欢这个想法。甚至更令人难为情的是，有些事我永远都不会说出来，我希望他的毒液毒化我的机体。这样会使我以某种看得见、摸得着的量化方式属于他。">查看中文翻译</div>
