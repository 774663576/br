<div class="line_en">In the morning, I have no time or energy to nurse wounded feelings. During a predawn breakfast of liver pâté and fig cookies, we gather around Tigris's television for one of Beetee's break-ins. There's been a new development in the war. Apparently inspired by the black wave, some enterprising rebel commander came up with the idea of confiscating people's abandoned automobiles and sending them unmanned down the streets. The cars don't trigger every pod, but they certainly get the majority. At around four in the morning, the rebels began carving three separate paths -- simply referred to as the A, B, and C lines -- to the Capitol's heart. As a result, they've secured block after block with very few casualties.</div>

<div class="line_en">A chill runs through me. Am I really that cold and calculating? Gale didn't say, "Katniss will pick whoever it will break her heart to give up," or even "whoever she can't live without." Those would have implied I was motivated by a kind of passion. But my best friend predicts I will choose the person who I think I "can't survive without." There's not the least indication that love, or desire, or even compatibility will sway me. I'll just conduct an unfeeling assessment of what my potential mates can offer me. As if in the end, it will be the question of whether a baker or a hunter will extend my longevity the most. It's a horrible thing for Gale to say, for Peeta not to refute. Especially when every emotion I have has been taken and exploited by the Capitol or the rebels. At the moment, the choice would be simple. I can survive just fine without either of them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我禁不住打了个冷战。我真的那么冷漠，那么精于算计吗？盖尔没有说“凯特尼斯会选择没有了他她就会心碎的人”或者“选择她离不开的人”。这样说好像我还是重感情的人。但我最好的朋友却预言我会选“没有他就无法生存的人”。话里的意思根本就是说我不是为爱，或者为欲望，甚至是相互投缘来选择我的感情。我只能不掺杂任何感情因素，估算我的伴侣能给予我什么，来判断要不要他。这好像在说，我要在一个猎人和一个面包师之间衡量哪个能让我更长寿。盖尔这么说真可怕，而皮塔也竟然没有反对。要知道，我的感情几乎被凯匹特或者反抗军完全毁掉了。从眼前的情况看，我的选择很简单，他们俩无论缺了谁，我都会活得很好。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"This can't last," says Gale. "In fact I'm surprised they've kept it going so long. The Capitol will adjust by deactivating specific pods and then manually triggering them when their targets come in range." Almost within minutes of his prediction, we see this very thing happen on-screen. A squad sends a car down a block, setting off four pods. All seems well. Three scouts follow and make it safely to the end of the street. But when a group of twenty rebel soldiers follow them, they're blown to bits by a row of potted rosebushes in front of a flower shop.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这种情况不会持续太久，事实上，他们能行进得如此深入，我很吃惊。凯匹特可以关闭某些堡德，然后等目标接近时，再手动触发一些堡德。”盖尔说。他话音未落，我们就在屏幕上看到他预料之中的事。一个小分队让无人驾驶的汽车开入一个街区，触发了四个堡德，一切看上去很正常。三名侦察员紧随其后，走到了街道尽头。但当二十人的小分队向前突进时，却被一个花店门前的灌木盆栽炸成了碎片。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I hear scuffling out on the street, move to the windows, and peek out a crack in the shutters. In the early morning light, I see a bizarre spectacle. Refugees from the now occupied blocks are streaming toward the Capitol's center. The most panicked are wearing nothing but nightgowns and slippers, while the more prepared are heavily bundled in layers of clothes. They carry everything from lapdogs to jewelry boxes to potted plants. One man in a fluffy robe holds only an overripe banana. Confused, sleepy children stumble along after their parents, most either too stunned or too baffled to cry. Bits of them flash by my line of vision. A pair of wide brown eyes. An arm clutching a favorite doll. A pair of bare feet, bluish in the cold, catching on the uneven paving stones of the alley. Seeing them reminds me of the children of 12 who died fleeing the firebombs. I leave the window.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我听到大街上一片嘈杂声，于是靠近窗户，从百叶窗的缝隙向外看。在微明的清晨，我看到一幅奇怪的图景。目前已被占领的街区的居民正在拥入凯匹特市中心区域，许多慌张的人们只穿着睡袍和拖鞋，而那些早有准备的人却穿着好几层衣服，带着许多东西，从宠物狗、首饰盒，到盆栽植物。一个穿着绒毛睡衣的人甚至只拿着一根熟透的香蕉。困倦、慌乱的孩子连跑带颠地跟在大人的后面，他们或许是受到惊吓或许是太过谎张，连哭都不会了。混乱的景象在百叶窗前闪过，时而是一双惶恐的棕色眼睛，时而是一只抱着心爱的娃娃的胳膊，时而是一双已被冻得青紫、在人行道的石板路上乱跑的光脚丫。看到他们，让我想起了十二区逃离燃烧弹袭击时丧生的孩子。我赶紧从窗户旁走开。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Down in the cellar I pace back and forth, driving the others crazy. Something tells me that not taking advantage of the flood of refugees is a mistake. What better cover could we have? On the other hand, every displaced person milling about on the streets means another pair of eyes looking for the five rebels on the loose. Then again, what do we gain by staying here? All we're really doing is depleting our small cache of food and waiting for… what? The rebels to take the Capitol? It could be weeks before that happens, and I'm not so sure what I'd do if they did. Not run out and greet them. Coin would have me whisked back to 13 before I could say "nightlock, nightlock, nightlock." I did not come all this way, and lose all those people, to turn myself over to that woman. I kill Snow. Besides, there would be an awful lot of things I couldn't easily explain about the last few days. Several of which, if they came to light, would probably blow my deal for the victors' immunity right out of the water. And forget about me, I've got a feeling some of the others are going to need it. Like Peeta. Who, no matter how you spin it, can be seen on tape tossing Mitchell into that net pod. I can imagine what Coin's war tribunal will do with that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在地窖里，我不安地踱来踱去，其他人看到我这样也快给逼疯了。我内心的某些东西在告诉我，不利用这奔逃的人流是个错误。我们还能找到比这更好的掩护吗？从另一个角度讲，在大街上奔走的每一个人的每一双眼睛都成为五名在逃的反叛者的监视者。可是，反过来讲，我们待在这里又能得到什么？我们所能做的就是消耗我们不多的食物，然后等待着…什么？反抗军夺取凯匹特城？要等到那时还需要几个星期。而且，如果他们真的夺取了凯匹特，我也不敢肯定我又会怎么做。不会跑出去恭迎他们。在我还没来得及说“索命果，索命果，索命果”的时候，科恩就会把我运回十三区。我费尽千辛万苦跑到这里，又失去了那么多人，可不是为了把自己重新交回那个女人的手里。我要杀死斯诺。再说，对于过去几天发生的事情，要解释清楚并非易事。有几件事如果暴露了真实意图，那么给胜利者免除罪名的协议就只好告吹。先不说我，我有种感觉，其他的胜利者会需要这个协议。比如说皮塔。无论怎样为他辩解，毕竟是他使米切尔落人铁丝网，而且这一情景已经被人们在电视屏幕上看到。我可以想见科恩的法庭会怎样审判他。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As I chew, I try to pay attention to Tigris telling us how she acquired it, but the main thing I absorb is that fur underwear is a valuable trading item at the moment. Especially for people who left their homes underdressed. Many are still out on the street, trying to find shelter for the night. Those who live in the choice apartments of the inner city have not flung open their doors to house the displaced. On the contrary, most of them bolted their locks, drew their shutters, and pretended to be out. Now the City Circle's packed with refugees, and the Peacekeepers are going door to door, breaking into places if they have to, to assign houseguests.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我一边吃，一边听泰格里丝向我们叙述她是怎么弄到这些吃的的。但我听到的一个最重要的信息是目前皮草内衣是很紧俏的商品，特别对于那些逃走时穿得很单薄的人尤为急需。许多人还在大街上踯躅，设法找到过夜的地方。那些住在市中心的人并没有打开大门欢迎这些逃难者。相反，多数人紧锁大门，窗户关闭，假装外出了。现在市中心到处都是逃难者，治安警正在挨家挨户地强令住家打开大门，去接纳这些逃难者。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">By late afternoon, we're beginning to get uneasy about Tigris's long absence. Talk turns to the possibilities that she has been apprehended and arrested, turned us in voluntarily, or simply been injured in the wave of refugees. But around six o'clock we hear her return. There's some shuffling around upstairs, then she opens the panel. The wonderful smell of frying meat fills the air. Tigris has prepared us a hash of chopped ham and potatoes. It's the first hot food we've had in days, and as I wait for her to fill my plate, I'm in danger of actually drooling.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到了下午，泰格里丝还没回来，我们开始感到不安。大家推测她可能已被捕，并被迫供出了实情，也可能在拥挤的人群中受了伤。但是到了六点，我们听见她回来了。楼上先是一阵脚步声，然后她拉开了隔板。一股炸肉的味道随着她飘了进来。泰格里丝给我们准备了碎火腿和烤土豆。这是我们几天来所吃的第一顿热饭，当我等着她给我盛第二盘的时候，我的口水差点流出来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">On the television, we watch a terse Head Peacekeeper lay out specific rules regarding how many people per square foot each resident will be expected to take in. He reminds the citizens of the Capitol that temperatures will drop well below freezing tonight and warns them that their president expects them to be not only willing but enthusiastic hosts in this time of crisis. Then they show some very staged-looking shots of concerned citizens welcoming grateful refugees into their homes. The Head Peacekeeper says the president himself has ordered part of his mansion readied to receive citizens tomorrow. He adds that shopkeepers should also be prepared to lend their floor space if requested.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在电视上，我们看到一个讲话很干脆的警长就居民的安置问题发表了简短的声明，说明了每平方英尺的住房应接纳多少逃难者。他提醒凯匹特市民，今晚的气温可能会降到零度以下，他同时警告居民，总统希望在这个特殊的危急时刻，每个公民都应心甘隋愿地做一个热情的主人。然后电视上播放了一些居民欢迎逃难者进入他们家中的表演性的镜头。警长说，明天总统本人已经下命令腾出总统府邸的部分房间，来接纳各位公民。他又接着说，必要时请商店店主把地板也让出来供居民居住。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Tigris, that could be you," says Peeta. I realize he's right. That even this narrow hallway of a shop could be appropriated as the numbers swell. Then we'll be truly trapped in the cellar, in constant danger of discovery. How many days do we have? One? Maybe two?</div>

It seems that this evening there was an unfortunate incident where a crowd beat to death a young man who resembled Peeta.

The gesture seems to touch her in some way. Her face contorts in an odd expression and she flies into action. She spends the next hour remaking the five of us. She redresses us so regular clothes hide our uniforms before we even don our coats and cloaks. Covers our military boots with some sort of furry slippers. Secures our wigs with pins. Cleans off the garish remains of the paint we so hastily applied to our faces and makes us up again. Drapes our outerwear to conceal our weapons. Then gives us handbags and bundles of knickknacks to carry. In the end, we look exactly like the refugees fleeing the rebels.</div>

<div class="line_en">I'm mulling over the wisdom of this latest role as we sprint across the intersection, but by the time we reach the next block, it no longer matters who we are. Who anyone is. Because no one is looking at faces. The rebels are here, all right. Pouring onto the avenue, taking cover in doorways, behind vehicles, guns blazing, hoarse voices shouting commands as they prepare to meet an army of Peacekeepers marching toward us. Caught in the cross fire are the refugees, unarmed, disoriented, many wounded.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Then we better start moving before the whole block goes up," says Gale. Hugging the wall, we continue along the street. Only the wall is mostly shopwindows. A pattern of sweaty palms and gaping faces presses against the glass. I yank my scarf up higher over my cheekbones as we dart between outdoor displays. Behind a rack of framed photos of Snow, we encounter a wounded Peacekeeper propped against a strip of brick wall. He asks us for help. Gale knees him in the side of the head and takes his gun. At the intersection, he shoots a second Peacekeeper and we both have firearms.</div>

<div class="line_en">A pod's activated ahead of us, releasing a gush of steam that parboils everyone in its path, leaving the victims intestine-pink and very dead. After that, what little sense of order there was unravels. As the remaining curlicues of steam intertwine with the snow, visibility extends just to the end of my barrel. Peacekeeper, rebel, citizen, who knows? Everything that moves is a target. People shoot reflexively, and I'm no exception. Heart pounding, adrenaline burning through me, everyone is my enemy. Except Gale. My hunting partner, the one person who has my back. There's nothing to do but move forward, killing whoever comes into our path. Screaming people, bleeding people, dead people everywhere. As we reach the next corner, the entire block ahead of us lights up with a rich purple glow. We backpedal, hunker down in a stairwell, and squint into the light. Something's happening to those illuminated by it. They're assaulted by… what? A sound? A wave? A laser? Weapons fall from their hands, fingers clutch their faces, as blood sprays from all visible orifices -- eyes, noses, mouths, ears. In less than a minute, everyone's dead and the glow vanishes. I grit my teeth and run, leaping over the bodies, feet slipping in the gore.

<div class="line_en">On the next block, we encounter more terrified refugees, but few soldiers. Just when it seems we might have caught a break, there's a cracking sound, like an egg hitting the side of a bowl but magnified a thousand times. We stop, look around for the pod. There's nothing. Then I feel the tips of my boots beginning to tilt ever so slightly. "Run!" I cry to Gale. There's no time to explain, but in a few seconds the nature of the pod becomes clear to everyone. A seam has opened up down the center of the block. The two sides of the tiled street are folding down like flaps, slowly emptying the people into whatever lies beneath.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在下一个街区，我们遇到了更多逃难的人，正当我们觉得可以松一口气的时候，传来了一个声音，像是鸡蛋壳打在碗边的声音，但比那放大了一千倍。什么也没有发生。接着，我感到自己的靴子尖开始倾斜。“快跑！”我冲盖尔喊道。已经没有时间解释了，只不过几秒钟时间，这个堡德露出了它的真实面目。在街区中心裂开了一个大缝。石板大街像野兽的大口一样向内张开，慢慢地把街面上的人吞噬了进去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Get down!" I hiss at Gale. We drop where we are. My face lands in a still-warm pool of someone's blood, but I play dead, remain motionless as the boots march over us.

<div class="line_cn" title="“趴下！”我小声对盖尔说。我们立刻在原地卧倒。我的脸趴在一大摊还温热的血上，可我一动不动，假装成死人，一阵慌乱的脚步从我们身旁跑过。一些人避开满地的尸体，另外有些人踏在我的手上、背上，有些踢在我的头上。当脚步声过去后，我睁开眼睛，朝盖尔点点头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I'm torn between making a beeline for the next intersection and trying to get to the doors that line the street and break my way into a building. As a result, I end up moving at a slight diagonal. As the flap continues to drop, I find my feet scrambling, harder and harder, to find purchase on the slippery tiles. It's like running along the side of an icy hill that gets steeper at every step. Both of my destinations -- the intersection and the buildings -- are a few feet away when I feel the flap going. There's nothing to do but use my last seconds of connection to the tiles to push off for the intersection. As my hands latch on to the side, I realize the flaps have swung straight down. My feet dangle in the air, no foothold anywhere. From fifty feet below, a vile stench hits my nose, like rotted corpses in the summer heat. Black forms crawl around in the shadows, silencing whoever survives the fall.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我一时不知道该直跑到前面的十字路口，还是奔向街道旁的大门，然后破门而入。结果，我往前方斜插过去。当大口张得更大时，我脚步不稳，脚底越来越抓不住光滑的地面。那感觉就像在光滑的冰山上行进，每迈出一步，山就越陡。当脚下的石板路完全塌陷时，我的两个目标——十字路口和旁边的屋子——离我只有几英尺远。没办法，我只能脚下一用力，猛地扑向十字路口。我的手抓住街边的石头，发现石板路面已经直接掉落下去。我的脚吊在空中，没有了着落。张开的大口子有五十英尺深，一股恶臭扑鼻而来，就像夏天腐烂尸体散发的气味。黑乎乎的人影在里面乱爬，幸免于难的人都惊呆了。">查看中文翻译</div>

I inch my hands along the ledge, trying to block out the terrifying sounds from below. When my hands straddle the corner, I swing my right boot up over the side. It catches on something and I painstakingly drag myself up to street level. Panting, trembling, I crawl out and wrap my arm around a lamppost for an anchor, although the ground's perfectly flat.</div>

Realized there was no need for a diversion when the Capitol has provided so many. No need to be bait and have to take the nightlock -- the nightlock! Gale doesn't have any.

The rebels!" and know they must've broken through. The momentum slams me into a flagpole and I cling to it. Using the rope that hangs from the top, I pull myself up out of the crush of bodies. Yes, I can see the rebel army pouring into the Circle, driving the refugees back onto the avenues. I scan the area for the pods that will surely be detonating. But that doesn't happen. This is what happens:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然一阵骚动，人群拥向了左边，我也被挤到了旁边，远离了我的目标。我听到人们喊：“反叛者！反叛者！”我知道反抗军已经攻破了凯匹特的防线，打过来了。人群把我挤到了一根旗杆旁，我赶紧抓住旗杆，顺着旗杆的拉绳爬了上去，躲开了拥挤的人群。是的，我可以看到反抗军攻入了圆形广场，把人群驱散到大街上。我扫视广场，搜寻着这里的堡德，心想一定会被触发，但堡德没有被触发。却发生了下面的事：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Circle's full of people milling around, wailing, or just sitting and letting the snow pile up around them. I fit right in. I begin to weave my way across to the mansion, tripping over abandoned treasures and snow-frosted limbs. About halfway there, I become aware of the concrete barricade. It's about four feet high and extends in a large rectangle in front of the mansion. You would think it would be empty, but it's packed with refugees. Maybe this is the group that's been chosen to be sheltered at the mansion? But as I draw closer, I notice something else. Everyone inside the barricade is a child. Toddlers to teenagers. Scared and frostbitten. Huddled in groups or rocking numbly on the ground. They aren't being led into the mansion. They're penned in, guarded on all sides by Peacekeepers. I know immediately it's not for their protection. If the Capitol wanted to safeguard them, they'd be down in a bunker somewhere. This is for Snow's protection. The children form his human shield.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="广场上堆满了人，有的在哭泣，有的径直坐在地上，一任飘落的雪花堆积在他们身旁。我穿过人群，朝总统府邸走去，脚下不停地被人们丢弃的财宝或者冻僵的肢体绊着。走到约一半的距离，我发现总统府邸的门前有一些水泥路障。路障大约四英尺高，呈长方形围在总统府邸周围。本以为里面没有人，但是里面却堆满了逃难者。也许这些人是被挑选出来住在总统府邸的人？当我走近时，却看到围在路障里面的全部是孩子，从蹒跚学步的幼儿到十几岁的少年。他们都很恐惧，冻得要命。他们或挤作一团，或麻木地坐在地上摇摆。他们没有被领进总统府邸，而是被圈在这里，四周由治安警看守。我马上看出来治安警不是为了保护他们，如果凯匹特想保护他们，就会让他们去隐蔽的地方。这是为了保护斯诺，这些孩子们是他的人墙。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A hovercraft marked with the Capitol's seal materializes directly over the barricaded children. Scores of silver parachutes rain down on them. Even in this chaos, the children know what silver parachutes contain. Food. Medicine. Gifts. They eagerly scoop them up, frozen fingers struggling with the strings. The hovercraft vanishes, five seconds pass, and then about twenty parachutes simultaneously explode.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一架标有凯匹特市徽的直升机悄无声息地出现在那些孩子的上方。无数的银色降落伞纷然飘落。即使在这么混乱的情况下，孩子们也知道银色降落伞带来了什么。食物。药品。礼物。他们急切地把降落伞抱起来，用冻僵的小手试图打开绳子。直升机消失了，五秒钟过去了，之后约二十个降落伞同时爆炸。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A wail rises from the crowd. The snow's red and littered with undersized body parts. Many of the children die immediately, but others lie in agony on the ground. Some stagger around mutely, staring at the remaining silver parachutes in their hands, as if they still might have something precious inside. I can tell the Peacekeepers didn't know this was coming by the way they are yanking away the barricades, making a path to the children. Another flock of white uniforms sweeps into the opening. But these aren't Peacekeepers. They're medics. Rebel medics. I'd know the uniforms anywhere. They swarm in among the children, wielding medical kits.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="人群里传来一片哭喊声。白雪上散落着许多短小的残肢断臂。许多孩子立刻毙命，可还有些痛苦地躺在地上。有一些在地上无声地蹒跚，盯着手里的银色降落伞，好像觉得里面应该还有一些珍贵的东西。治安警看来也并不知情，因为他们正搬开路障，打开一条通向孩子们的路。另外一群治安警拥入了刚打开的入口。不，他们不是治安警，是医务人员，反抗军的医务人员。这种制服无论到哪儿我都认识。他们冲到孩子们中间，迅速打开急救箱。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">First I get a glimpse of the blond braid down her back. Then, as she yanks off her coat to cover a wailing child, I notice the duck tail formed by her untucked shirt. I have the same reaction I did the day Effie Trinket called her name at the reaping. At least, I must go limp, because I find myself at the base of the flagpole, unable to account for the last few seconds. Then I am pushing through the crowd, just as I did before. Trying to shout her name above the roar. I'm almost there, almost to the barricade, when I think she hears me. Because for just a moment, she catches sight of me, her lips form my name.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我起先看到了一个人，金色头发，辫子甩在身后。而后，当她脱掉大褂罩在一个孩子身上的时候，我注意到她的衬衫后面没有塞到裤子里，像一个鸭子尾巴露在外面。我的反应就像艾菲·特琳奇在收获节仪式上念出她的名字时一样，身子一下子瘫软了，滑落到旗杆底下，有几秒钟的时间动弹不得。接着我推开前面的人群，向她走去。就像以前一样，我扯开嗓子在嘈杂的人群里大喊她的名字。我就快要走到跟前了，就快要到路障了，我觉得她听见了我的呼喊。因为在那一瞬问，她看到了我，她的嘴唇嚅动着喊出了我的名字。">查看中文翻译</div>
