<div class="line_en">She looked back at the waves and pulled hard and carefully with her oars. It was more than a kilometre around the islands from the lighthouse to the ship, and every wave, every rock was different and dangerous. She was tired now, but the job was not finished. The wrecked ship on Harker's Rock was still fifty metres away.</div>

<div class="line_en">Grace looked quickly behind her, and saw the people on the rock. They were waving, shouting, laughing. But there were eight, nine, perhaps ten of them! Too many for this small boat.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes. Put me on the rock, lass, and then take the boat out again," shouted William. "I'll talk to them. We can't take more than five, the first time."</div>

<div class="line_en">It was very dangerous near the rock. In the best place, the waves went up and down two or three metres every minute. "If we make one mistake," Grace thought, "the boat will break into fifty small pieces, and we'll be on the rock with the others."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="礁石附近非常危险。即使在情况最好的地方，波浪每分钟也要起伏两三米。“一旦出错，”格雷丝想，“船就会撞得粉碎，我们就得和其他人一起待在礁石上。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="格雷丝和父亲试图将船小心地、缓缓地靠近礁石，但是试了三次，每次都不得不在最后一刻把船划开。终于在第四次，威廉·达林跳了出去。乘客们把他拉上礁石。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Grace quickly rowed the boat out to sea again. She was alone in the boat now, and the boat moved differently. She was tired, and her arms and back were hurting. But she knew about boats. "Watch the sea all the time." she told herself. "The waves must meet the front of the boat first, or the boat will turn over. Forget the cold, and the rain, and the wet. God will help me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="格雷丝迅速将小船划回海里。现在她一个人在船上，船的行进与之前也不一样。她很累，胳臂和背都很疼。但是她知道该怎么划船。“要一直注意海，”她告诉自己，“海浪必须先碰到船头，否则就会翻船。忘记寒冷，忘记雨水，忘记浑身的潮湿。上帝会帮助我的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On the rock, William Darling spoke quickly. "I'm going to take the woman back with me," he said. "And that man there, with the broken leg. Then I need three strong men, to help me row the boat." He looked at Daniel Donovan, and two others. "You, man, and you, and you. The others must wait here. We'll come back for you later."</div>

<div class="line_en">Carefully, he took the boy and the girl from her, and put the little bodies on the rock, near the sea. They were dead and cold. "They are in God's hands, mother," he said. Then he spoke quickly and quietly to Daniel Donovan. "When the boat comes, help me get the woman in. We can't take her children."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他小心地把男孩和女孩接过来，把两个小小的身体放在靠近海的礁石上。他们已经死了，身体冰冷。“他们已经在上帝手里了，妈妈。”说完，他迅速而平静地对丹尼尔·多诺万说：“船一来，帮我把这位女士弄上去。我们不能带着她的孩子。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Carefully, slowly, she rowed the boat in to the rock. It was harder without her father. The wind and the waves moved the boat more quickly, and Grace was very tired now. One mistake meant death for them all. She came closer -- twenty metres, ten, seven, five… A big wave lifted the boat, then a smaller one behind it. She pulled hard on the oars, and threw a rope to a man on the rock. Then her father got into the boat, with a woman in his arms. She was screaming.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她谨慎而缓慢地划着船靠近礁石。父亲不在，划船变得更加艰难。风浪对小船的冲击更快了，而且格雷丝现在非常疲惫。一个错误就会导致所有人丧生。她靠近了——二十米，十米，七米，五米…一个巨浪将小船托起，接着又一个小浪。她努力地划着桨，向礁石上的一个人扔出了一条绳子。片刻后，她的父亲上了船，胳臂里搂着一个女人，女人在尖叫。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="格雷丝和女人一起走到船尾并扶住她。丹尼尔·多诺万和另外两个男人也上来了。他们抬着断了腿的男人。船头现在很靠近礁石——太近了。格雷丝一回头，看到一个巨浪。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The little boat was very full. The sides were only just above the water, and often the water came in. Grace threw it out with her hat. The wind and waves were against them now, and the four men had to row hard. But slowly, very slowly, the lighthouse came nearer. At last, from the top of the waves, they could see Thomasin Darling. She was standing in front of the lighthouse, and waving to them.</div>
