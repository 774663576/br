<div class="line_en">The field was near a quiet road. At the side of the road was a small school. It stood in a garden. There were flowers and vegetables and a few fruit trees. But no children were there. The school was empty. It was summer and the children were on holiday.</div>

<div class="line_en">There was a little kitchen. Tony turned on the tap. He took a long drink and filled his bottle. Then he decided to look around the little school. It did not take him long. There was one classroom. The desks and chairs were very small, because it was a school for young children. Tony went back into the kitchen. "It's July," he thought. "Everyone is on holiday. School doesn't start again until September. I can put the piano here. No one will come here. I've got six weeks. And in six weeks perhaps I can find a home for my piano."</div>

<div class="line_en">The next morning the boys got up at six o'clock. They took some sandwiches and a bottle of cold tea, and they began to cut the long grass in Mr Wood's biggest field.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I want a drink of water," he said to Pip and John. He took the empty bottle and went into the school garden. There was a tap there and he turned it. No water came out. He went to the door of the school. He pushed -- and it opened.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我想要喝水。”他对皮普和约翰说。他拿上空瓶子，来到学校的花圃，那儿有个水龙头。他拧开水龙头，但没有水。他走到学校门口，推了推门，门开了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“这就对了！”托尼说道，“听我说——门是开的，钥匙就插在门上。我不会偷任何东西，我只是想把我的钢琴放在那儿，只不过一两周的时间…你们能帮我吗？我们可以把钢琴放在卡车上，然后开车把它运到学校来。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"But…" began Tony. He looked into her kind brown eyes and he told her his story. He told her about his old school. He told her about Mrs Lark. He talked about the village school, and the open door, and the quiet, empty classroom. Linda listened. John and Pip listened too. Then Linda smiled.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可是…”托尼开口说道。他注视着她那双温柔的褐色的眼睛，把事情的始末告诉了她。他跟她说了自己原来的学校，说到拉克夫人，还讲了村子里的学校、那扇敞开的校门和那间安安静静、空荡荡的教室。琳达听着，约翰和皮普也听着。然后，琳达笑了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Boys," said Linda, "Father says you are borrowing the lorry tonight."</div>

<div class="line_en">"It looks beautiful here," said Pip. He touched the keys. They made a loud, unmusical noise.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“它放在这儿真漂亮。”皮普评论道。他按了几下琴键，钢琴发出不成旋律的嘈杂响声。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“请你们9点半过来！”她对皮普嚷道。她有意提高嗓门，因为凯瑟琳的母亲就在一旁听着。然后，她又轻轻地说：“祝你好运！托尼——小心点！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The boys drove the lorry to the little school. Then they moved the piano. It was very heavy, but they were young and strong. They pushed it into the classroom and stood it against a wall.</div>

<div class="line_en">Tony sat down and began to play one of Mrs Lark's songs. The music sang in his mind. It travelled along his arms. His fingers danced over the keys. He did not look at his hands. He did not look at the keys. His eyes were closed. He was in another world.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="托尼坐下来，开始弹奏拉克夫人教他们的一首曲子。乐曲回旋在他的脑海里，通过双臂传递到他的手上。他的手指在琴键上跳跃着。他既没有看自己的双手，也没有看琴键。他闭着眼睛，进入了另外一个世界。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Listen to that!" said his brother. "You had piano lessons for three years, but you didn't learn anything. Play something for us, Tony."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“听听！”他的弟弟说道，“你上了三年钢琴课，可是什么也没有学会。给我们弹点儿什么吧，托尼。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His friends listened. Tony was not clever. He was big and quiet and slow. But there was music in his big, strong hands.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的朋友们静静地听着。托尼并不聪明，他个子大，话也不多，行动起来慢吞吞的。可是，他那双粗壮的大手却奏出了优美的乐曲。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tony learned to read music. Linda brought him a book of easy songs. She showed him the music. He looked at the little black notes and the five thin black lines on the pages of the book.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="托尼开始学着识谱。琳达给他带来一本简单的乐谱，教他看谱子。他注视着书页上小小的黑色音符和那五条细细的黑线。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That summer was a happy time for Tony. Every evening after supper he borrowed Linda's bicycle. He cycled to the school, and he played the piano. When it was dark he cycled back to the farm again. He was afraid to turn on a light in the school. He did not want anybody to see him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那个夏天，托尼过得很开心。每天晚上吃过晚餐，他都借琳达的自行车一直骑到学校，然后就开始弹琴。他会一直弹到天黑，然后再骑车回到农场。他不敢在学校里开灯，因为他不想被别人看到。">查看中文翻译</div>
