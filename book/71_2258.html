<div class="line_en">Never in his life, perhaps, had Franz ever felt such a sharply defined and rapid transformation from merriment to sadness as he did at that moment. You would have thought that Rome, under the magic wand of some demon of the night, had changed into one vast tomb. By an eventuality which added to the blackness of the night, the moon was waning and not due to rise until eleven o'clock, so the streets through which the young man walked were plunged in utter darkness. But the journey was short. In ten minutes his carriage -- that is to say, the count's -- stopped at the Hôtel de Londres.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在他的一生中，弗兰士或许从来不曾得到过这样突兀的一个印象，从来不曾经验过象目前这样从欢乐到悲哀的急速的转变。似乎整个罗马，在一个夜叉的一口魔气之下，突然变成了一座大坟墓，刚好时逢月缺，月亮要到十一点钟才会升起来，这就更增加黑暗的浓度。所以这个青年人所经过的街道，是被包围在最深的阴暗里。路途原很短，十分钟以后，他的马车，或说得更正确些，伯爵的马车，已在伦敦旅馆门前停下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dinner was waiting for him but, since Albert had warned him that he might not return immediately, Franz sat down to eat without waiting for him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="晚餐已预备好了，但因为阿尔培已对他说过，他不会很快就回来，所以弗兰士也就不等他，独自在餐桌前坐了下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Signor Pastrini, who was used to seeing them dine together, asked why Albert was not there, but Franz said no more than that his friend had received an invitation two days earlier and had accepted it. The sudden extinction of the moccoletti, the darkness that had replaced the light and the silence that had followed the din had left Franz feeling melancholy, and even a little tense; so he dined in total silence, even though Signor Pastrini was as attentive as ever and came in two or three times to ask if he had everything he needed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="派里尼老板一向总是看到他们一同用膳的，就问他阿尔培为什么不在，弗兰士回答说，阿尔培昨天晚上接到一张请帖，赴宴去了。长生烛的突然熄灭，接替光明的黑暗，和那继骚闹喧嚣而来的沉寂，都在弗兰士的头脑里留下某种不安的抑郁之感。所以，虽然他的店东向他表示过分殷勤的关切，并几次三番亲自来问他有没有什么需要，他用膳的时候还是非常沉静。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Franz was determined to wait up as late as possible for Albert, so he ordered the carriage only for eleven o'clock, asking Signor Pastrini to inform him immediately if Albert reappeared at the hotel for any reason. At eleven Albert had not returned, so Franz dressed and left, telling his host that he would be spending the night at the Duke of Bracciano's.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="弗兰士决定尽可能的等一等阿尔培。他吩咐马车在十一点钟的时候准备好，希望到那时派里尼老板来通报阿尔培回旅馆了。到十一点，阿尔培还没有回来。弗兰士就穿上衣服出去，告诉店东他到勃拉西诺公爵府去，今晚不回来了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Duke of Bracciano's house is one of the most delightful in Rome. His wife, one of the last heirs of the Colonna family, is a perfect hostess. Consequently the duke's entertainments are famous throughout Europe. Franz and Albert had arrived in Rome with letters of introduction to him, so his first question was to ask Franz what had become of his travelling companion. Franz replied that he had left him at the moment just as the moccoli were about to be extinguished and that he had lost sight of him in the Via Macello.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="勃拉西诺公爵府是罗马最令人欢乐的家庭之一。他的夫人是哥伦纳斯王国最后一代的哲嗣之一，她把公爵府布置得十分雅致优美，所以他们的宴会是闻名全欧的。弗兰士和阿尔培曾带着介绍信来拜会过他们，所以弗兰士一到，第一个问题便是他的旅伴到哪儿去了。弗兰士回答说，他是在长生烛快熄的时候离开他的，后来就混到玛西罗街的人群里不见了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This meant that the two of them, Franz and Albert together, were seven or eight hundred piastres short of the amount asked for. It is true that in such a case Franz could count on the understanding of Messrs Torlonia.

He graciously offered the right-hand seat to Beppo and sat beside him. Thereupon Beppo told him he would be driven to a villa a league outside Rome. The Frenchman assured Beppo that he was prepared to follow him to the end of the earth. At this, the coachman went up the Via Ripetta, through the Porta San Paolo and, two hundred yards into the countryside, as the Frenchman was starting to get a little too forward, Beppo stuck a pair of pistols in his throat; upon which the coachman stopped the horses, turned around in his seat and did the same. At the same time four of our men who had been hiding on the banks of the Almo rushed across to the doors. The Frenchman tried his best to defend himself and even, so I heard, half strangled Beppo, but there was not much to be done against five armed men. He had to give up.

The bandit was watching the whole of this scene with stupefaction: obviously, he was used to his prisoners trembling before him, but here was one whose derisive and quizzical mood had not faltered for a moment. As for Franz, he was delighted that Albert had upheld the honour of their nation, even when dealing with a bandit.</div>

<div class="line_en">"My dear Albert," he said, "if you would hurry, we may yet have time to end the night in Torlonia's.
