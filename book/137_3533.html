<div class="line_en">This populace, disciplined to waiting for public executions, did not manifest very much impatience. It amused itself with watching the pillory, a very simple sort of monument, composed of a cube of masonry about six feet high and hollow in the interior. A very steep staircase, of unhewn stone, which was called by distinction "the ladder," led to the upper platform, upon which was visible a horizontal wheel of solid oak. The victim was bound upon this wheel, on his knees, with his hands behind his back. A wooden shaft, which set in motion a capstan concealed in the interior of the little edifice, imparted a rotatory motion to the wheel, which always maintained its horizontal position, and in this manner presented the face of the condemned man to all quarters of the square in succession. This was what was called "turning" a criminal.</div>

<div class="line_en">That crowd which the four sergeants posted at nine o'clock in the morning at the four corners of the pillory had inspired with the hope of some sort of an execution, no doubt, not a hanging, but a whipping, a cropping of ears, something, in short,-- that crowd had increased so rapidly that the four policemen, too closely besieged, had had occasion to "press" it, as the expression then ran, more than once, by sound blows of their whips, and the haunches of their horses.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="早晨九点钟就有四名什长分立在耻辱柱四角。因此，群众指望就要正正规规地行刑了：大概不会是绞刑，但起码也得是鞭刑，或者割耳朵，反正总得有点什么。于是，顷刻之间，人愈集愈多，那四名什长被挤得太厉害，只好不止一次——用当时的话来说——向两侧“压压”他们，就是说，使用皮索鞭和马屁股。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As the reader perceives, the pillory of the Grève was far from presenting all the recreations of the pillory of the Halles. Nothing architectural, nothing monumental. No roof to the iron cross, no octagonal lantern, no frail, slender columns spreading out on the edge of the roof into capitals of acanthus leaves and flowers, no waterspouts of chimeras and monsters, on carved woodwork, no fine sculpture, deeply sunk in the stone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可以看出，河滩的耻辱柱，要说给人娱乐，远远不如菜市场的耻辱柱那么好玩。建筑艺术谈不上；巍峨建筑更谈不上。没有带铁十字架的屋顶，没有八角灯，没有细长圆柱直耸屋顶边缘，顶端展开，形成莨菪叶饰和花饰斗拱，也没有奇兽怪物造型的承溜，没有精雕细刻的木架，没有深深刻入石头的精工雕塑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The victim finally arrived, bound to the tail of a cart, and when he had been hoisted upon the platform, where he could be seen from all points of the Place, bound with cords and straps upon the wheel of the pillory, a prodigious hoot, mingled with laughter and acclamations, burst forth upon the Place.

<div class="line_en">Quasimodo, impassible, did not wince. All resistance had been rendered impossible to him by what was then called, in the style of the criminal chancellery, "the vehemence and firmness of the bonds" which means that the thongs and chains probably cut into his flesh; moreover, it is a tradition of jail and wardens, which has not been lost, and which the handcuffs still preciously preserve among us, a civilized, gentle, humane people (the galleys and the guillotine in parentheses).</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡席莫多漠然不为所动，连眉头也不皱一下。任何反抗都是不可能的，因为——按照当时刑事判决的用语——“束缚坚固而牢靠”，这就是说，皮索和铁链大概都嵌进肉里面去了。不过，这是一种至今还没有丢弃的监狱和苦刑船传统，而且通过手铐把它在我们这样的文明、优雅、人道的民族中间保留至今（且不说苦役场和断头台）。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Soon Michel Noiret, sworn trumpeter to the king, our lord, imposed silence on the louts, and proclaimed the sentence, in accordance with the order and command of monsieur the provost. Then he withdrew behind the cart, with his men in livery surcoats.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was he, in fact. The change was singular. Pilloried on the very place where, on the day before, he had been saluted, acclaimed, and proclaimed Pope and Prince of Fools, in the cortege of the Duke of Egypt, the King of Thunes, and the Emperor of Galilee! One thing is certain, and that is, that there was not a soul in the crowd, not even himself, though in turn triumphant and the sufferer, who set forth this combination clearly in his thought. Gringoire and his philosophy were missing at this spectacle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="果真是他。他这次归来可也奇特：今天他绑在耻辱柱上，而昨天就在这个广场上，众人一致欢呼致敬，拥戴他为众丑之王，随从他的有埃及公爵、屠纳王和伽利略皇帝！但是，肯定无疑，人群中任何人，甚至凯旋而去、缧绁而归的卡席莫多自己，脑子里都没有清楚地想到作此今昔对比。眼前这个场面只欠格兰古瓦和他的哲学。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They placed him on his knees on the circular plank; he made no resistance. They removed his shirt and doublet as far as his girdle; he allowed them to have their way.

It was Master Pierrat Torterue, official torturer to the Châtelet.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the meantime, Jehan Frollo, elevating his curly blonde head above the crowd (he had mounted upon the shoulders of Robin Poussepain for the purpose), shouted: "Come and look, gentle ladies and men! they are going to peremptorily flagellate Master Quasimodo, the bellringer of my brother, monsieur the archdeacon of Josas, a knave of oriental architecture, who has a back like a dome, and legs like twisted columns!"</div>

<div class="line_en">He began by depositing on an angle of the pillory a black hour-glass, the upper lobe of which was filled with red sand, which it allowed to glide into the lower receptacle; then he removed his parti-colored surtout, and there became visible, suspended from his right hand, a thin and tapering whip of long, white, shining, knotted, plaited thongs, armed with metal nails. With his left hand, he negligently folded back his shirt around his right arm, to the very armpit.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他一上去就把一个黑色的沙漏时计放在耻辱柱的一个角落里。这个沙漏上面的瓶子里装满红色沙子，向下面的容器漏下去。接着，他脱去两色对半的披风。于是，群众看见他右手上吊着一根细皮鞭，白色的长皮索闪亮，编绞成束，尽是疙瘩，尖端是一个个金属爪。他伸出左手，漫不经心地挽起右臂衬衫袖子，一直挽至腋下。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Quasimodo leaped as though awakened with a start. He began to understand. He writhed in his bonds; a violent contraction of surprise and pain distorted the muscles of his face, but he uttered not a single sigh. He merely turned his head backward, to the right, then to the left, balancing it as a bull does who has been stung in the flanks by a gadfly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡席莫多这才猛醒，就地往上一窜。他开始明白了。他在捆绑中扭曲着身子，又惊讶又痛苦，脸猛烈抽搐着，脸上的肌肉也紊乱了。但是，一声叹息也没有。他只是把脑袋使劲向后仰，又左右躲闪，晃动着，就像一头公牛给牛虻猛螫腰侧。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">All at once, at the moment when the wheel in its revolution presented to Master Pierrat, the humped back of Quasimodo, Master Pierrat raised his arm; the fine thongs whistled sharply through the air, like a handful of adders, and fell with fury upon the wretch's shoulders.</div>

<div class="line_en">Quasimodo had resumed, to all appearance, his first imperturbability. He had at first tried, in a quiet way and without much outward movement, to break his bonds. His eye had been seen to light up, his muscles to stiffen, his members to concentrate their force, and the straps to stretch. The effort was powerful, prodigious, desperate; but the provost's seasoned bonds resisted. They cracked, and that was all. Quasimodo fell back exhausted. Amazement gave way, on his features, to a sentiment of profound and bitter discouragement. He closed his single eye, allowed his head to droop upon his breast, and feigned death.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡席莫多至少表面上又恢复了原来的漠然。起初，外表上看不出来，他却悄悄地使劲，企图挣断绳索链条。只见他两眼冒火，肌肉僵硬，四肢蜷缩，皮索和链条绷得紧紧的了。这场挣扎极为有力，令人惊赞，却也是绝望的挣扎。然而，府尹衙门久经考验的缧绁颇有韧性，轧轧一阵响，如此而已。卡席莫多精疲力竭，颓然作罢。脸上的惊愕换成了痛苦而又深沉的沮丧表情。他那只独眼闭了起来，脑袋搭拉在胸前，半死不活的样子。">查看中文翻译</div>

He had still to undergo that hour of pillory which Master Florian Barbedienne had so judiciously added to the sentence of Messire Robert d'Estouteville; all to the greater glory of the old physiological and psychological play upon words of Jean de Cumène, Surdus absurdus: a deaf man is absurd.</div>

<div class="line_en">We have already shown that Quasimodo was generally hated, for more than one good reason, it is true. There was hardly a spectator in that crowd who had not or who did not believe that he had reason to complain of the malevolent hunchback of Notre-Dame. The joy at seeing him appear thus in the pillory had been universal; and the harsh punishment which he had just suffered, and the pitiful condition in which it had left him, far from softening the populace had rendered its hatred more malicious by arming it with a touch of mirth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="读者从上述已经得知：卡席莫多为众人所憎恨，——确实，理由不止一个，而且都很充足。人群中间简直找不出一个人，没有（或者自认为没有）理由来嫌恶圣母院驼子这坏蛋。先前看见他出现在耻辱柱台子上的时候，大家都高兴得不得了；而后他受尽酷刑，刑余幸存的可怜状态，远远没有使得观众大发慈悲，只是使人们的憎恨中有了一份欢乐的成分，从而憎恨更带残忍。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Hence, the "public prosecution" satisfied, as the bigwigs of the law still express it in their jargon, the turn came of a thousand private vengeances.

<div class="line_en">Nevertheless, that cloud cleared away for a moment, at the passage of a mule which traversed the crowd, bearing a priest. As far away as he could see that mule and that priest, the poor victim's visage grew gentler. The fury which had contracted it was followed by a strange smile full of ineffable sweetness, gentleness, and tenderness. In proportion as the priest approached, that smile became more clear, more distinct, more radiant. It was like the arrival of a Saviour, which the unhappy man was greeting. But as soon as the mule was near enough to the pillory to allow of its rider recognizing the victim, the priest dropped his eyes, beat a hasty retreat, spurred on rigorously, as though in haste to rid himself of humiliating appeals, and not at all desirous of being saluted and recognized by a poor fellow in such a predicament.</div>

<div class="line_en">This exclamation of distress, far from exciting compassion, only added amusement to the good Parisian populace who surrounded the ladder, and who, it must be confessed, taken in the mass and as a multitude, was then no less cruel and brutal than that horrible tribe of robbers among whom we have already conducted the reader, and which was simply the lower stratum of the populace. Not a voice was raised around the unhappy victim, except to jeer at his thirst. It is certain that at that moment he was more grotesque and repulsive than pitiable, with his face purple and dripping, his eye wild, his mouth foaming with rage and pain, and his tongue lolling half out. It must also be stated that if a charitable soul of a bourgeois or bourgeoise, in the rabble, had attempted to carry a glass of water to that wretched creature in torment, there reigned around the infamous steps of the pillory such a prejudice of shame and ignominy, that it would have sufficed to repulse the good Samaritan.</div>

<div class="line_en">Quasimodo's eyes sparkled. It was the gypsy whom he had attempted to carry off on the preceding night, a misdeed for which he was dimly conscious that he was being punished at that very moment; which was not in the least the case, since he was being chastised only for the misfortune of being deaf, and of having been judged by a deaf man. He doubted not that she had come to wreak her vengeance also, and to deal her blow like the rest.</div>
