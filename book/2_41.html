<div class="line_en">I was meeting John's mother for the first time this afternoon and he was fervently coaching me on how to make a good impression. "While she's talking, offer to cut her a piece of fruit from the basket. Cut the fruit in front of her so she can see how well you cut. Get an apple and make sure you peel the skin really thin so that she knows you don't waste food. And make sure you cut it in even slices and lay it down facing the same direction so she knows you can present food in an appetizing manner…" John continued to lecture as I stared blankly out the window.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Tell her you got this especially for her," John said to me as he drove, pointing to the basket of fruit wrapped in clear acetate sitting on the back seat. "Remember when you get in, you have to bow to her. Not a half bow but the full bow, the traditional Korean way, with your hands on your forehead." I shifted in the passenger seat uncomfortably. "Then, she's probably going to ask you questions about your ancestry, where you went to school, your goals…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“告诉她，这是你特地为她买的，”约翰一边开车，一边指了指后座上的果篮说道，“记住，一进门时要向她鞠躬。把你的手放在额头上，用韩国传统的全鞠躬方式，而不是半鞠躬。”我产生了一种不自在的感觉，在座位上挪了一下身体。“然后，她可能会问你的家族情况，你所读的学校，你今后的目标…”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I had just started dating John, a Korean international student who had been in the States for about 3 years now. I was born in Korea, but I moved to the United States when I was five years old. I know how to speak, read, and write Korean and I thought I had learned enough from my family and watched enough TV programs to know about Korean customs. I guess I was wrong, John and I had our differences. He didn't speak perfect English, but I figured it was okay because I didn't speak perfect Korean either.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="约翰是一个韩国留学生，他来美国3年了，我与他才刚刚开始约会。我在韩国出生，然而5岁时就移民到了美国。我会说、能读、能写朝鲜语，我自认为通过家庭的熏陶和观看电视节目，已经了解了足够多的韩国风俗文化。不过，看看我和约翰之间的差异，我觉得自己错了。约翰的英语说得不是很熟练，但是我认为还算可以，因为我的朝鲜语说得也不地道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But 1ittle problems between our differing cultures surfaced as we continued to date. When we went out to eat, I noticed he'd have trouble reading the menus. When he registered for a class, he scheduled it with my free time so that he had someone to talk for him, like a translator. I accepted the fact that he couldn't speak perfect English, but what was really frustrating was that he wasn't willing to try. It may have been his male pride, but I think he was more embarrassed about the puzzled looks people would give him when he talked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，随着我们约会的次数越来越多，我们之间由于文化差异，逐渐暴露出了一些小问题。我们出去吃饭的时候，我发现他不太能看懂菜单。为了在上课时能让我像翻译一样帮他讲解，他注册课程还专门挑选了我有空闲时间的时候。我愿意接受他英语不好的事实，然而，真正令我感到沮丧的，是他根本不愿意尝试着去说。这可能是男人的自尊心在作怪，不过我认为，他是害怕自己跟别人讲话时，看到别人迷惑不解的样子会更尴尬。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There would be times when he wouldn't talk single word for hours. It was hard for him to blend in with my Asian-American friends. Once, I and my friends were reminiscing about the 80's, things like Michael Jackson, Madonna, teased hair and those awful UMEN cardigans. But while we were laughing away, talking about old times, John just sat there uncomfortably with half a grin on his face. I tried to include him in on our conversations by explaining what we were talking about, but by the look on his face I could tell I wasn't very successful.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有时候，接连好几个小时，他一个字也不愿意说，很难与我的亚裔美国朋友相处。有一次，我和朋友们回忆起80年代的岁月，像迈克尔·杰克逊、麦当娜、奇异的发型和那些不好看的优盟牌开襟羊毛衫。然而，当我们开怀大笑、畅谈往事时，约翰一脸似笑非笑的样子，不自在地坐在那里。我向他解释我们谈话的内容，努力让他加入我们。然而，从他脸上的表情可以看出，我的努力无动于衷。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One night John came over to my house to pick me up for dinner. My brother's friend Chris was over and they were talking in the living room. Chris said to my brother jokingly, "Man… You're so bad… You're a big pimp." John overheard and replied in his most perfect English, trying to be protective of my brother, "No, he isn't bad, he's actually a good boy. And he is definitely not a playboy." My brother and Chris stared at John in disbelief. Chris was so shocked he apologized to my brother for offending him. As for John, I knew he felt proud for sticking up for my brother. I know he meant well. But he just didn't understand the language.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一天晚上，约翰到我家接我一起去吃晚餐，正好碰上我弟弟和他朋友克里斯在客厅里聊天。克里斯跟我弟弟开玩笑说：“你这个家伙…你真是太坏了…你这个老皮条客。”约翰无意中听到了，试图为我弟弟辩解，便用他说得最好的英语句子解释道：“不，他一点都不坏，他是个好男孩，他也绝不是一个花花公子。”我的弟弟和克里斯都难以置信地盯着约翰看，他们简直不敢相信自己的耳朵。克里斯被吓了一跳，赶忙为刚才那个玩笑向我弟弟道歉。我知道，约翰一定为维护我弟弟的尊严而感到自豪。我知道他是好意，他只是不懂语言。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Don't get me wrong. I had a great time learning and experiencing new things with him. We were exposed to different worlds and we taught each other how to cope, accept, and learn in different perspectives. In fact, many couples I know have had successful intercultural relationships. But my relationship made me realize how little cultural differences can make a big difference.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不要误解我的意思。与他一起学习和体验新事物的那段日子，我觉得非常快乐。我们生活在不同的世界里，我们教会彼此如何从不同的角度应对、接受和学习。事实上，很多跨文化婚姻中的夫妇生活得都很幸福。然而，我们之间的关系让我体会到了一点，即使是很细微的文化差异，也会让我们产生很大的分歧。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I found that I had a lot more to learn and get accustomed to than I expected. I suppose a successful intercultural relationship depends on how accepting one is to the other's differences and how well a person can adapt to new ideas, thoughts, and lifestyles. Anyway, these relationships can be challenging. As you may have guessed, I'm not with John any more. Meeting his Mom went fine, but I have a feeling I cut the apple skin too thick.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我发现，要学习和适应的事情远远超过了我的想象。我想，如何接受彼此的差异，如何适应新的观念、思想和生活方式，决定着一段跨文化恋情是否能够成功。无论如何，这种跨文化的恋情颇具挑战性。正如你可能猜想到的结局一样，现在，我与约翰已经分手了。对于那次拜访，尽管我觉得自己把苹果皮削得太厚了，但我们相处得还不错。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There were little things that I eventually became accustomed to. For instance, John and I always had to watch TV with the caption turned on and I had to be careful not to use any slang that he wasn't familiar with. I had to speak slower. I always had to explain why we did certain things here, versus how they did them in Korea. I had to constantly recap the stories of the movies we just saw. But the toughest obstacle was trying to describe our feelings or thoughts to each other, trying to learn about our different worlds with our limited vocabularies.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对于生活上的一些小事，我终于习惯了。比如，我和约翰看电视的时候总是打开字幕，我说话的时候尽量避免使用俚语，放慢语速；我总是要向他解释，为什么在这儿要这样做事情，就像他在韩国一样；我还要不断地重述刚刚看过的电影情节。然而，最大的障碍是相互交流彼此的感情和想法，我们只能用有限的词汇了解彼此不同的世界。">查看中文翻译</div>
