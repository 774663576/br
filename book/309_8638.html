<div class="line_en">Liesel spent the last few months of 1942 consumed by thoughts of what she called three desperate men. She wondered where they were and what they were doing.</div>

<div class="line_en">One afternoon, she lifted the accordion from its case and polished it with a rag. Only once, just before she put it away, did she take the step that Mama could not. She placed her finger on one of the keys and softly pumped the bellows. Rosa had been right. It only made the room feel emptier.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一天下午，她把手风琴从琴盒里取出来，用抹布仔细擦拭。在放回原位之前，她做了一件妈妈做不到的事。她把手指放在琴键上，轻柔地鼓动风箱。罗莎说得没错，音乐只会让房间显得更空旷。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was with great optimism that she envisioned him walking alone on a deserted road. Once in a while she imagined him falling into a doorway of safety somewhere, his identity card enough to fool the right person.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她无比乐观地设想他独自一人走在一条荒芜的路上。有时，她会想象他找到了一个安全的场所，他的身份证总是能骗过那些看门人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Whenever she met Rudy, she asked if there had been any word from his father. Sometimes he described to her in detail one of Alex Steiner's letters. By comparison, the one letter her own papa had sent was somewhat of a disappointment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="每当遇见鲁迪，她都会问亚力克斯有没有托人给他们带去音信。有时候，他会把亚力克斯来信的详细内容讲给她听。相比之下，她爸爸寄来的那一封信是多么让她失望。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She saw her papa in the window at school. Max often sat with her by the fire. Alex Steiner arrived when she was with Rudy, staring back at them after they'd slammed the bikes down on Munich Street and looked into the shop.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她会在学校的窗户上看见爸爸。马克斯常常陪伴她坐在炉火旁。每次她和鲁迪骑车经过慕尼黑大街，打量着曾经的裁缝店，亚力克斯·施泰纳便会出现在前方，回头看着他们的身影。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Strangely, one of Liesel's favorite distractions was Frau Holtzapfel. The reading sessions included Wednesday now as well, and they'd finished the water-abridged version of The Whistler and were on to The Dream Carrier. The old woman sometimes made tea or gave Liesel some soup that was infinitely better than Mama's. Less watery.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="奇怪的是，莉泽尔现在很喜欢去霍尔茨埃普费尔太太家。她们连星期三都安排了朗读活动，已经读完了被河水泡过的《吹口哨的人》，现在正读着《送梦人》。老妇人有时会给她泡壶茶，有时会给她炖碗汤，味道不知比妈妈的豌豆汤好上多少倍，而且没放那么多水。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Between October and December, there had been one more parade of Jews, with one to follow. As on the previous occasion, Liesel had rushed to Munich Street, this time to see if Max Vandenburg was among them. She was torn between the obvious urge to see him -- to know that he was still alive -- and an absence that could mean any number of things, one of which being freedom.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="十月到十二月间又有一次犹太人的游街，接下来还有一次。莉泽尔像上次那样冲到慕尼黑大街上，想看看队伍里有没有马克斯·范登堡的身影。内心有两股互相矛盾的欲望在撕扯着她，她非常想见到他，这说明他还活着，又希望他不在队列里面——缺席意味着许多可能性，其中一种便是他依旧自由。">查看中文翻译</div>
