<div class="line_en">I'd been avoiding Shawn since the night in the bathroom. He'd apologized. He'd come into my room an hour later, his eyes glassy, his voice croaking, and asked me to forgive him. I'd said that I would, that I already had. But I hadn't.</div>

<div class="line_en">Three days later, when she was nineteen, Audrey was married -- to Benjamin, a blond-haired farm boy she'd met waitressing in town. The wedding was solemn. Dad had prayed and received a revelation: "There will be a conflict, a final struggle for the Holy Land," he'd said. "My sons will be sent to war. Some of them will not come home."</div>

<div class="line_en">In September the twin towers fell. I'd never heard of them until they were gone. Then I watched as planes sank into them, and I stared, bewildered, at the TV as the unimaginably tall structures swayed, then buckled. Dad stood next to me. He'd come in from the junkyard to watch. He said nothing. That evening he read aloud from the Bible, familiar passages from Isaiah, Luke, and the Book of Revelation, about wars and rumors of wars.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="九月，世贸中心双子大楼倒塌了。在它们消失前，我从未听说过它们。我困惑地盯着电视，看着飞机撞向它们，那些我难以想象的高耸入云的建筑摇摇晃晃，然后轰然倒塌。爸爸站在我旁边。他刚从废料场回来。他什么也没说。那天晚上，他从《圣经》的《以赛亚书》《路加福音》和《启示录》中选取关于战争和战争传言的熟悉段落，大声朗读。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">One Sunday afternoon, I helped Mother prepare a roast for dinner. Dad was kicking off his shoes and loosening his tie. He'd been talking since we left the church.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一个星期天的下午，我帮母亲准备晚餐的烤肉。爸爸正脱掉鞋子，解开领带。我们从教堂出来后他就一刻不停地说话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For a month I lived as if holding my breath. Then there was no draft, no further attacks. The skies didn't darken, the moon didn't turn to blood. There were distant rumblings of war but life on the mountain remained unchanged. Dad said we should stay vigilant, but by winter my attention had shifted back to the trifling dramas of my own life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="整整一个月，我屏息以待。但是没有征兵，也没有再发生袭击事件。天空没有变暗，月亮没有滴血。远处有战火的隆隆声，但山上的生活一如往常。爸爸说我们应该保持警惕，但冬天来临时，我的注意力重归日常生活的琐事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That something else thrilled and frightened me. I'd always known that I would grow differently than my brothers, but I'd never thought about what that might mean. Now it was all I thought about. I began to look for cues to understand this difference, and once I started looking, I found them everywhere.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="还有一件事让我紧张又害怕。我一直知道我长大了会和哥哥们不一样，但我以前从未想过这意味着什么。现在我脑子里全是这个。为了理解这些差异，我开始寻找蛛丝马迹，而一旦开始找寻，我便发现它们无处不在。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I was fifteen and I felt it, felt the race I was running with time. My body was changing, bloating, swelling, stretching, bulging. I wished it would stop, but it seemed my body was no longer mine. It belonged to itself now, and cared not at all how I felt about these strange alterations, about whether I wanted to stop being a child, and become something else.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当时我十五岁，我感觉到自己正与时间赛跑。我的身体一直在变化，肿胀，鼓起，伸展，凸出。我希望我的身体能停止生长，但它似乎不再属于我。它现在属于它自己，根本不在乎我对这些奇异的变化作何感觉，也不在乎我是否不再想当小孩，而想成为别的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"That hemline was three inches above Lori's knee," Dad said. "What's a woman thinking when she puts on a dress like that?" Mother nodded absently while chopping a carrot. She was used to this particular lecture.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“洛丽的裙摆在膝盖以上三英寸，”爸爸说，“一个女人穿那样的裙子是想干什么？”母亲一边切胡萝卜，一边心不在焉地点了点头。她已经习惯了这种话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"And Jeanette Barney," Dad said. "If a woman wears a blouse that low-cut, she ought not bend over." Mother agreed. I pictured the turquoise blouse Jeanette had worn that day. The neckline was only an inch below her collarbone, but it was loose-fitting, and I imagined that if she bent it would give a full view. As I thought this I felt anxious, because although a tighter blouse would have made Jeanette's bending more modest, the tightness itself would have been less modest. Righteous women do not wear tight clothing. Other women do that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“还有珍妮特·巴尼，”爸爸说，“一个女人要是穿着低胸上衣，就不该弯下腰。”母亲表示同意。我回想珍妮特那天穿的蓝绿色衬衫，领口在锁骨以下一英寸，但很宽松，我想象着如果她弯下腰，里面会一览无余。想到这一点让我感到焦虑，因为虽然紧身衬衫会让珍妮特弯腰时更端庄，但紧身衣服本身就不正派了。正派女人从不穿紧身衣服，不正经的女人才会穿成那样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I was trying to figure out exactly how much tightness would be the right amount when Dad said, "Jeanette waited to bend for that hymnal until I was looking. She wanted me to see." Mother made a disapproving tsk sound with her teeth, then quartered a potato.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我正想弄清楚到底什么松紧程度的衣服才算合适，这时爸爸说：“珍妮特等着拿赞美诗集时弯腰让我看。她就想让我瞧呢。”母亲用牙齿发出不满的啧啧声，然后将一个土豆切成四块。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This speech would stay with me in a way that a hundred of its precursors had not. I would remember the words very often in the years that followed, and the more I considered them, the more I worried that I might be growing into the wrong sort of woman. Sometimes I could scarcely move through a room, I was so preoccupied with not walking or bending or crouching like them. But no one had ever taught me the modest way to bend over, so I knew I was probably doing it the bad way.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="与之前不同，这一席话前所未有地深深印在我的脑海。在接下来的岁月里，我常常会回想这些话，越想着它们，越担心自己会变成那种不正经的女人。有时我在家里几乎不敢动，留意着不要像那种女人一样走路、弯腰或蹲着。但从没有人教过我怎样弯腰才算端庄，所以我知道有可能我弯腰的样子也很糟糕。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The first time I wore lip gloss, Shawn said I was a whore. I was in my bedroom, standing in front of my mirror, trying it out, when Shawn appeared in the doorway. He said it like a joke but I wiped the color from my lips anyway. Later that night, at the theater, when I noticed Charles staring at Sadie, I reapplied it and saw Shawn's expression twist. The drive home that night was tense. The temperature outside had fallen well below zero. I said I was cold and Shawn moved to turn up the heat. Then he paused, laughed to himself, and rolled all the windows down. The January wind hit me like a bucket of ice. I tried to roll up my window, but he'd put on the child lock. I asked him to roll it up. "I'm cold," I kept saying, "I'm really, really cold." He just laughed. He drove all twelve miles like that, cackling as if it were a game, as if we were both in on it, as if my teeth weren't clattering.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我第一次涂口红，肖恩说我像个妓女。当时我正站在自己的卧室镜子前试着涂口红，肖恩出现在门口。他开玩笑一般说了那句话，但我还是将嘴唇上的颜色都擦掉了。之后，当晚在剧场，我注意到查尔斯盯着赛迪看，又重新涂上口红，看见肖恩的表情扭曲了。那晚开车回家的路上，气氛紧张。外面的气温已经降到零度以下。我说我很冷，让肖恩把暖风调高点。他愣了一下，笑了笑，把所有窗户都放了下来。一月的寒风打在身上冰冷刺骨。我想将旁边的窗户摇上来，但他上了儿童锁。我请求他把窗户摇上。“我很冷，”我不停地说，“我真的真的很冷。”他只是大笑。整整十二英里路，他都咯咯笑着，仿佛这是一场游戏，仿佛我们都乐在其中，仿佛我没有冷得牙齿直打战。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I thought things would get better when Shawn dumped Sadie -- I suppose I'd convinced myself that it was her fault, the things he did, and that without her he would be different. After Sadie, he took up with an old girlfriend, Erin. She was older, less willing to play his games, and at first it seemed I was right, that he was doing better.</div>

<div class="line_en">A pistol lay on the seat between us, and when he wasn't shifting gears, Shawn picked it up and caressed it, sometimes spinning it over his index like a gunslinger before laying it back on the seat, where light from passing cars glinted off the steel barrel.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在我们俩中间的座位上放着一把手枪。肖恩不换挡时便拿起手枪抚摸，有时像个神枪手一样在食指上旋转手枪，让枪管反射着过往汽车的光亮，然后才将枪放回座位。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then Charles asked Sadie to dinner, Sadie said yes, and Shawn heard about it. I was working late at Randy's that night when Shawn turned up, frothing at the mouth. I left with him, thinking I could calm him, but I couldn't. He drove around town for two hours, searching for Charles's Jeep, cursing and swearing that when he found that bastard he was "gonna give him a new face." I sat in the passenger seat of his truck, listening to the engine rev as it guzzled diesel, watching the yellow lines disappear beneath the hood. I thought of my brother as he had been, as I remembered him, as I wanted to remember him. I thought of Albuquerque and Los Angeles, and of the miles of lost interstate in between.</div>

<div class="line_en">Shawn took a step back. He had waited until Dad and Luke were out of the house, away on a job, so his physicality could go unchallenged. Confronting his younger brother -- less vicious but powerful in his own way -- was more than he'd bargained for.</div>

It seemed to me that Tyler knew exactly what he was doing, that he had done this before, when they were younger and less evenly matched. Tyler halted his forward march but he didn't blink. He glared at Shawn as if to say, Whatever is happening here, it's done.</div>

<div class="line_en">That night, when I came home, Shawn was gone. Mother was in the kitchen blending oils. She said nothing about that morning, and I knew I shouldn't mention it. I went to bed, but I was still awake hours later when I heard a pickup roar up the hill. A few minutes later, my bedroom door creaked open. I heard the click of the lamp, saw the light leaping over the walls, and felt his weight drop onto my bed. I turned over and faced him. He'd put a black velvet box next to me. When I didn't touch it, he opened the box and withdrew a string of milky pearls.</div>

<div class="line_en">I ran to Tyler's car, which was wedged between Shawn's truck and the chicken coop. I tried to back out, but I stomped too hard on the gas and the tires spun out, sending gravel flying. On my second attempt I succeeded. The car shot backward and circled around. I shifted into drive and was ready to shoot down the hill when Tyler appeared on the porch. I lowered the window. "Don't go to work," he said. "He'll find you there."</div>

<div class="line_en">The passage described the great prophet Mormon, a fact I'd found confusing. A woman could never be a prophet, yet here was Tyler, telling me I reminded him of one of the greatest prophets of all. I still don't know what he meant by it, but what I understood at the time was that I could trust myself: that there was something in me, something like what was in the prophets, and that it was not male or female, not old or young; a kind of worth that was inherent and unshakable.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这段文字描述的是伟大的先知摩门，这一事实让我感到困惑。女人永远不可能成为先知，但泰勒告诉我，我让他想起了最伟大的先知之一。现在我仍然不清楚他那么说是什么意思，但我当时的理解是，我可以相信自己：我身上有某种东西，某种先知们具有的东西，它不论男女，也不分老少，是一种内在的、不可动摇的价值。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When i awoke the next morning, my neck was bruised and my wrist swollen. I had a headache -- not an ache in my brain but an actual aching of my brain, as if the organ itself was tender. I went to work but came home early and lay in a dark corner of the basement, waiting it out. I was lying on the carpet, feeling the pounding in my brain, when Tyler found me and folded himself onto the sofa near my head. I was not pleased to see him. The only thing worse than being dragged through the house by my hair was Tyler's having seen it. Given the choice between letting it play out, and having Tyler there to stop it, I'd have chosen to let it play out. Obviously I would have chosen that. I'd been close to passing out anyway, and then I could have forgotten about it. In a day or two it wouldn't even have been real. It would become a bad dream, and in a month, a mere echo of a bad dream. But Tyler had seen it, had made it real.</div>
