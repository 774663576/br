<div class="line_en">I used to play out the beggar's last moments over and over again in my head. In my mind, I saw the executioner strip off the man's shirt and lead him into the open yard. "This traitor," read the executioner, "is sentenced to die the death of a thousand cuts." But before he could even raise the sharp sword to whittle his life away, they found the beggar's mind had already broken into a thousand pieces. A few days later, my great-grandfather looked up from his books and saw this same man looking like a smashed vase hastily put back together. "As the sword was cutting me down," said the ghost, "I thought this was the worst I would ever have to endure. But I was wrong. The worst is on the other side." And the dead man embraced my great-grandfather with the jagged pieces of his arm and pulled him through the wall, to show him what he meant.</div>

<div class="line_en">As I remember it, the dark side of my mother sprang from the basement in our old house in Oakland. I was five and my mother tried to hide it from me. She barricaded the door with a wooden chair, secured it with a chain and two types of key locks. And it became so mysterious that I spent all my energies unraveling this door, until the day I was finally able to pry it open with my small fingers, only to immediately fall headlong into the dark chasm. And it was only after I stopped screaming -- I had seen the blood of my nose on my mother's shoulder -- only then did my mother tell me about the bad man who lived in the basement and why I should never open the door again. He had lived there for thousands of years, she said, and was so evil and hungry that had my mother not rescued me so quickly, this bad man would have planted five babies in me and then eaten us all in a six-course meal, tossing our bones on the dirty floor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我记得，奥克兰我们老家的地下室，老是让母亲不安惊恐，似乎那里藏着不可告人的秘密。那年我才五岁。妈想瞒过我，她将一把木头椅子抵住地下室的门，再套上两圈铁链，外加一把大铁锁，来了个双保险。这就更使其显得神秘莫测。我一直想方设法要开启它，直到有一天，偶然我的小手指碰着门，它就启开了，但未及我定下神，便一头坠在一团黑暗里，那种感觉，犹如栽入一道深不可测的裂口。待我能大声嚎叫时，发现我已经被母亲抱着，鼻血一滴一滴落在她肩头。这时，母亲才告诉我，地下室里住着一个坏蛋，他已在里面呆了几千年了，所以从此，我不应再去开启这扇门。她说，这是个穷凶极恶的坏蛋，她差点来不及把我拖出来。这个坏蛋，会让我生下五个婴儿，然后把我连带五个婴儿，一顿连骨带肉吞下。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I always thought it mattered, to know what is the worst possible thing that can happen to you, to know how you can avoid it, to not be drawn by the magic of the unspeakable. Because, even as a young child, I could sense the unspoken terrors that surrounded our house, the ones that chased my mother until she hid in a secret dark corner of her mind. And still they found her. I watched, over the years, as they devoured her, piece by piece, until she disappeared and became a ghost.</div>

<div class="line_en">And after that I began to see terrible things. I saw these things with my Chinese eyes, the part of me I got from my mother. I saw devils dancing feverishly beneath a hole I had dug in the sandbox. I saw that lightning had eyes and searched to strike down little children. I saw a beetle wearing the face of a child, which I promptly squashed with the wheel of my tricycle. And when I became older, I could see things that Causasian girls at school did not. Monkey rings that would split in two and send a swinging child hurtling through space. Tether balls that could splash a girl's head all over the playground in front of laughing friends.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从那以后，我经常目睹到许多吓人的场面。我是以一个中国人的眼光来看待这种恐怖，这种基因，得之于我妈。当我在沙箱里玩沙时，从我自己挖掘的洞里，我似窥到群魔在乱舞。我甚至看到他们青面撩牙的脸庞上，双目闪着绿光，正在虎视眈眈地搜寻着小孩子。一次我骑着三轮自行车玩，忽然发现地上的一只甲虫，竟会呈现出一张孩子的脸，我立即用车轮将它碾扁。再长大一点，我能看见许多别的女孩子看不到的怪事：滚铁环会突然一裂为二，将一个小孩子弹到半空。铁链球会突然脱离链条，击中一群正在嬉笑的孩子中的一个，脑浆溅了满操场。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I didn't tell anyone about the things I saw, not even my mother. Most people didn't know I was half Chinese, maybe because my last name is St. Clair. When people first saw me, they thought I looked like my father, English-Irish, big-boned and delicate at the same time. But if they looked really close, if they knew that they were there, they could see the Chinese parts. Instead of having cheeks like my father's sharp-edged points, mine were smooth as beach pebbles. I didn't have his straw-yellow hair or his white skin, yet my coloring looked too pale, like something that was once darker and had faded in the sun.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我对谁也没讲过这些，甚至我妈。多数人不知道我有一半中国血统，可能因为我有一个外国姓：“圣克莱尔”的缘故。我一眼看上去，挺像父亲，典型的英国爱尔兰人：高大匀称的个头，但如果他们再走近一点，就会发现，我的脸庞轮廓，不像父亲那般瘦削，我的线条是平缓浑和的，就像海滩上的卵石。我没有父亲的黄头发和白皮肤，可我的皮肤呈一种苍白色，就像被太阳晒退色似的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I have a photo of my mother with this same scared look. My father said the picture was taken when Ma was first released from Angel Island Immigration Station. She stayed there for three weeks, until they could process her papers and determine whether she was a War Bride, a Displaced Person, a Student, or the wife of a Chinese-American citizen. My father said they didn't have rules for dealing with the Chinese wife of a Caucasian citizen. Somehow, in the end, they declared her a Displaced Person, lost in a sea of immigration categories.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我见过妈的一张照片，眼神也是这样惶恐紧张。爸说那是妈在天使岛移民处出来后，第一次照的相。她在那里囚禁了三个星期，直到移民局得到足够的文件证明她是个战争新娘。只有因为战火而被迫逃离原所在国，或者是留学生，美国公民的配偶，才有资格可以从天使岛里释放出来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And my eyes, my mother gave me my eyes, no eyelids, as if they were carved on a jack-o'-lantern with two swift cuts of a short knife. I used to push my eyes in on the sides to make them rounder. Or I'd open them very wide until I could see the white parts. But when I walked around the house like that, my father asked me why I looked so scared.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但我的眼睛，是妈妈给的，它不是深陷的，倒像鬼神节里的南瓜灯上的眼睛；那种用小刀仓促拨出来的两个孔眼，猛一看，好像没有眼睑。为了让我的眼睛显得光彩一点，我常常故意睁圆双眼，然而当我带着这样的眼神在房子四周走动时，我父亲便会间我为什么显得这样紧张恐慌。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">My mother never talked about her life in China, but my father said he saved her from a terrible life there, some tragedy she could not speak about. My father proudly named her in her immigration papers: Betty St. Clair, crossing out her given name of Gu Ying-ying. And then he put down the wrong birthyear, 1916 instead of 1914. So, with the sweep of a pen, my mother lost her name and became a Dragon instead of a Tiger.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="妈从来不讲及她在中国的生活，但爸却说，是他把妈从一个可怕的境遇中解救出来。到底怎样可怕，他闭口不谈。爸骄傲地在她的移民证上，给她写上贝蒂·圣克莱尔，并划去她原来的中国名字：顾映映。然而他又搞错了妈的生辰，妈是1914年出生，他却写成1916年，就这么笔尖一扫，我妈的名字没了，生肖也由虎变成龙了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In this picture you can see why my mother looks displaced. She is clutching a large clam-shaped bag, as though someone might steal this from her as well if she is less watchful. She has on an ankle-length Chinese dress with modest vents at the side. And on top she is wearing a Westernized suit jacket, awkwardly stylish on my mother's small body, with its padded shoulders, wide lapels, and oversize cloth buttons. This was my mother's wedding dress, a gift from my father. In this outfit she looks as if she were neither coming from nor going to someplace. Her chin is bent down and you can see the precise part in her hair, a neat white line drawn from above her left brow then over the black horizon of her head.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Don't look at her," said my mother as we walked through Chinatown in Oakland. She had grabbed my hand and pulled me close to her body. And of course I looked. I saw a woman sitting on the sidewalk, leaning against a building. She was old and young at the same time, with dull eyes as though she had not slept for many years. And her feet and her hands -- the tips were as black as if she had dipped them in India ink. But I knew they were rotted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天在奥克兰中国城，在人行道上，妈突然一把抓住我的手，让我紧紧地挨着她，她一边低声叮嘱我：“别看她，一眼也别看。”当然，我怎么能不看呢？人行道上，一个女人正背靠墙席地而坐，这个女人目光呆滞，就像有好几年没睡过觉，看着既苍老，又年轻。她的指尖和脚尖，都呈紫黑色，好像在印度墨水里浸泡过似的。但我知道，那是溃烂。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And I knew that was not true. I knew my mother made up anything to warn me, to help me avoid some unknown danger. My mother saw danger in everything, even in other Chinese people. Where we lived and shopped, everyone spoke Cantonese or English. My mother was from Wushi, near Shanghai. So she spoke Mandarin and a little bit of English. My father, who spoke only a few canned Chinese expressions, insisted my mother learn English. So with him, she spoke in moods and gestures, looks and silences, and sometimes a combination of English punctuated by hesitations and Chinese frustration: "Shwo buchulai"-- Words cannot come out. So my father would put words in her mouth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我知道她在骗我，她之所以要编这一套或那一套，只不过是以此告诫我，帮助我躲过一些暗藏的漩涡。我妈就有这份天才，她能在一切事物中预测到灾难的征兆。甚至对其他的中国人，她也有这种预知的能力。在我们居住和购物的地方，人们几乎只讲广东话或英语。妈是无锡人，所以她只会说国语和一丁点英语。爸只会说呆板的几个中国词组，他坚决主张我妈学英语。因此每当妈与爸交谈，总是以语气、手势、表情和眼神来帮助，有时，她卡住了，便会用英语腔的中文，南腔北调地：“说——不——出——了。”这时，我父亲就会帮她把话说出来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The apartment building was three stories high, two apartments per floor. It had a renovated façade, a recent layer of white stucco topped with connected rows of metal fire-escape ladders. But inside it was old. The front door with its narrow glass panes opened into a musty lobby that smelled of everybody's life mixed together. Everybody meant the names on the front door next to their little buzzers: Anderson, Giordino, Hayman, Ricci, Sorci, and our name, St. Clair. We lived on the middle floor, stuck between cooking smells that floated up and feet sounds that drifted down. My bedroom faced the street, and at night, in the dark, I could see in my mind another life. Cars struggling to climb the steep, fog-shrouded hill, gunning their deep engines and spinning their wheels. Loud, happy people, laughing, puffing, gasping: "Are we almost there?"

<div class="line_en">My mother was not happy with the apartment, but I didn't see that at first. When we moved in, she busied herself with getting settled, arranging the furniture, unpacking dishes, hanging pictures on the wall. It took her about one week. And soon after that, when she and I were walking to the bus stop, she met a man who threw her off balance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="妈却看不顺眼这幢公寓。最初我还没觉察，刚搬进去时，她忙着收拾，几乎花了整整一星期时间才安排停当。这不久后的一天，她带我出去，刚走到车站，就给一个男人吓了一下。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was a red-faced Chinese man, wobbling down the sidewalk as if he were lost. His runny eyes saw us and he quickly stood up straight and threw out his arms, shouting, "I found you! Suzie Wong, girl of my dreams! Hah!" And with his arms and mouth wide open, he started rushing toward us. My mother dropped my hand and covered her body with her arms as if she were naked, unable to do anything else. In that moment as she let go, I started to scream, seeing this dangerous man lunging closer. I was still screaming after two laughing men grabbed this man and, shaking him, said, "Joe, stop it, for Chrissake. You're scaring that poor little girl and her maid."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那是个红脸中国人，在人行道上踉踉跄跄地走着，好像与他的同伴走失了。当他的浑浊的布满眼屎的眼睛转向我们时，立时停下来，直直地伸出双臂，乱嚷乱叫着：“我总算找到你了，苏茜斯，我梦中的情人。嗨！”说着，他便咧开嘴，张开双臂向我们扑来。妈立时放开我，双手护住自己前胸，好像她是赤裸裸的。就在妈松开我的一瞬间，我便拼命地尖叫着。那男人越来越逼近我，直到另外两个男人上来，嬉皮笑脸拽住他：“乔，得了，看在基督份上，别吓着了她们。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The rest of the day -- while riding on the bus, walking in and out of stores, shopping for our dinner -- my mother trembled. She clutched my hand so tightly it hurt. And once when she let go of my hand to take her wallet out of her purse at the cash register, I started to slip away to look at the candy. She grabbed my hand back so fast I knew at that instant how sorry she was that she had not protected me better.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从此不论在公共汽车上，还是进出商店，妈总是紧张得发抖，紧紧地攥住我的手，我被她捏得生疼。一次，当她暂时松开我的手，从钱包里掏钱去账台时，我便拔腿往糖果柜边溜，但她马上又一把将我揪回来。我知道那一眨眼间，她很抱歉未能拴住我。">查看中文翻译</div>

My bed was no longer by the window but against a wall. And where my bed once was -- now there stood a used crib. So the secret danger was a ballooning stomach, the source of my mother's imbalance. My mother was going to have a baby.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="几天后，我才明白。那天放学回家，发现妈重新调整了我的卧室。我的床从窗边移到墙边，而原先我搁床的地方，放着一张旧的小床，我顿时明白了，妈一切不安和担心的关键，因为她怀孕了。她的危险点，有如一只膨胀的大气球一样脆弱易破。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"See," said my father as we both looked at the crib. "Nesting instincts. Here's the nest. And here's where the baby goes." He was so pleased with this imaginary baby in the crib.

She did not speak of the joys of having a new baby; she talked about a heaviness around her, about things being out of balance, not in harmony with one another.

<div class="line_en">At home, my mother looked at everything around her with empty eyes. My father would come home from work, patting my head, saying, "How's my big girl," but always looking past me, toward my mother. I had such fears inside, not in my head but in my stomach. I could no longer see what was so scary, but I could feel it. I could feel every little movement in our silent house. And at night, I could feel the crashing loud fights on the other side of my bedroom wall, this girl being beaten to death. In bed, with the blanket edge lying across my neck, I used to wonder which was worse, our side or theirs? And after thinking about this for a while, after feeling sorry for myself, it comforted me somewhat to think that this girl next door had a more unhappy life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="妈的两眼，视而不见地在家里四处环视，目光滞呆，没有一丁点活力。每天父亲下班回家，总要拍拍我的头轻声问道：“我的大女儿今天怎样了？”嘴上这么说着，目光却越过我头顶，落到母亲身上。我内心充满一种莫名的惧怕。我无法说明白到底惧怕什么，但我却能感觉到那种不祥之兆。我便十分敏感，能觉察到静默的居室中，每一丝轻微细小的动静。晚上，墙那头的殴打声和争执声依旧不断，听着，似乎那女孩子会被打死的。我静静地躺在床上，把床单直扯到下巴下。我常常暗自估摸着，我们家和墙头那一家，哪一家更晦气更倒霉？比较了一阵后，自我安慰地觉得，隔壁的女孩子似乎更不快乐。">查看中文翻译</div>
