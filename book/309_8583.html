<div class="line_en">Molching, like the rest of Germany, was in the grip of preparing for Hitler's birthday. This particular year, with the development of the war and Hitler's current victorious position, the Nazi partisans of Molching wanted the celebration to be especially befitting. There would be a parade. Marching. Music. Singing. There would be a fire.</div>

<div class="line_en">While Liesel walked the streets of Molching, picking up and delivering washing and ironing, Nazi Party members were accumulating fuel. A couple of times, Liesel was a witness to men and women knocking on doors, asking people if they had any material that they felt should be done away with or destroyed. Papa's copy of the Molching Express announced that there would be a celebratory fire in the town square, which would be attended by all local Hitler Youth divisions. It would commemorate not only the Fuhrer's birthday, but the victory over his enemies and over the restraints that had held Germany back since the end of World War I. "Any materials," it requested, "from such times -- newspapers, posters, books, flags -- and any found propaganda of our enemies should be brought forward to the Nazi Party office on Munich Street." Even Schiller Strasse -- the road of yellow stars -- which was still awaiting its renovation, was ransacked one last time, to find something, anything, to burn in the name of the Fuhrer's glory. It would have come as no surprise if certain members of the party had gone away and published a thousand or so books or posters of poisonous moral matter simply to incinerate them.</div>

<div class="line_en">Against all hopelessness, Liesel still checked the mailbox each afternoon, throughout March and well into April. This was despite a Hans-requested visit from Frau Heinrich, who explained to the Hubermanns that the foster care office had lost contact completely with Paula Meminger. Still, the girl persisted, and as you might expect, each day, when she searched the mail, there was nothing.</div>

<div class="line_en">The young man was a Nazi; his father was not. In the opinion of Hans Junior, his father was part of an old, decrepit Germany -- one that allowed everyone else to take it for the proverbial ride while its own people suffered. As a teenager, he was aware that his father had been called "Der Juden Maler"-- the Jew painter -- for painting Jewish houses. Then came an incident I'll fully present to you soon enough -- the day Hans blew it, on the verge of joining the party. Everyone knew you weren't supposed to paint over slurs written on a Jewish shop front. Such behavior was bad for Germany, and it was bad for the transgressor.</div>
