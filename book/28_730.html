<div class="line_en">Normally, for security reasons, Malia and Sasha weren't allowed to ride in anyone else's car. Malia had a provisional license by then and was able to drive herself around town, though always with agents following in their own vehicle. But still, since moving to Washington at the age of ten, she'd never once ridden a bus or the Metro or been driven by someone who didn't work for the Secret Service. For prom night, though, we were making an exception.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the spring of 2015, Malia announced that she'd been invited to the prom by a boy she kind of liked. She was sixteen then, finishing her junior year at Sidwell. To us, she was still our kid, long-legged and enthusiastic as she'd always been, though every day she seemed to become a little more adult. She was now nearly as tall as I was and starting to think about applying to college. She was a good student, curious and self-possessed, a collector of details much like her dad. She'd become fascinated by films and filmmaking and the previous summer had taken it upon herself to seek out Steven Spielberg one evening when he'd come to the White House for a dinner party, asking him so many questions that he followed up with an offer to let her intern on a TV series he was producing. Our girl was finding her way.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Just be cool please, okay?" Malia had said to me and Barack, her embarrassment already beginning to smolder as we rode the elevator downstairs. I was barefoot, and Barack was in flip-flops. Malia wore a long black skirt and an elegant bare-shouldered top. She looked beautiful and about twenty-three years old.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“请表现得酷一点儿，好吗？”玛利亚提前嘱咐我和贝拉克道。但是，看到我们俩乘坐电梯下楼时，她开始觉得有些尴尬了，我当时赤着脚，贝拉克穿了一双平底人字拖。玛利亚自己穿了一件黑色长裙，露肩款式，显得优雅漂亮，看起来似乎已经有二十三岁那么大了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On the appointed evening, her date arrived in his car, clearing security at the southeast gate of the White House, following the path up and around the South Lawn by which heads of state and other visiting dignitaries normally arrived, and then gamely -- bravely -- walking into the Dip Room dressed in a black suit.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到了约定好的那天晚上，那名男生开车来到白宫，在东南门通过安检之后，径直往前开，绕着南草坪转了一圈停下。他的行车路线其实就是其他国家元首和一些要人到访白宫时所走的路线。然后，那名身穿黑色西服的小伙子勇敢地走下车，又勇敢而兴致勃勃地走进白宫的外交接待大厅。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">By my reckoning, we did manage to play it cool, though Malia still laughs, remembering it all as a bit excruciating. Barack and I shook the young man's hand, snapped a few pictures, and gave our daughter a hug before sending them on their way. We took what was perhaps unfair comfort in the knowledge that Malia's security detail would basically ride the boy's bumper all the way to the restaurant where they were going for dinner before the dance and would remain on quiet duty throughout the night.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对于我们当时的表现，虽然玛利亚至今回忆起来仍不禁发笑，说我们甚至让她有一点儿抓狂，但是在我看来，我们当时确实表现得很酷。我和贝拉克首先与那名男生握了手，拍了几张照片，然后又拥抱了下我们的女儿，最后送他们离开。但是，想到玛利亚的贴身特工一定会全程默默值守，一路跟随那名男生去他们用餐的餐厅，然后继续跟随他们参加舞会，我们多少感到一些安慰，尽管这样做对他们来说并不公平。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Once they got to high school, we gave the girls curfews -- first 11:00 and eventually midnight -- and enforced them, according to Malia and Sasha, with more vigor than many of their friends' parents did. If I was concerned about their safety or whereabouts, I could always check in with the agents, but I tried not to. It was important to me that the kids trusted their security team. Instead, I did what I think a lot of parents do and relied on a network of other parents for information, all of us pooling what we knew about where the flock of them was going and whether there'd be an adult in charge. Of course, our girls carried extra responsibility by virtue of who their father was, knowing that their screwups could make headlines. Barack and I both recognized how unfair this was. Both of us had pushed boundaries and done dumb things as teenagers, and we'd been fortunate to do it all without the eyes of a nation on us.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两个孩子一进入高中阶段，我们就对她们实行了宵禁制度—起初是晚上十一点，后来推迟至午夜十二点—并且强制她们必须执行。据玛利亚和萨沙说，与她们许多朋友的父母相比，我们的要求严格得多。在日常管理方面，如果我担心她们的安全，想要掌握她们的行踪，其实完全可以与特工们核实，但是，我尽量不让自己那么做。对我来说，孩子们与她们的特工之间建立起信任感是非常重要的。相反，我采取了在我看来很多父母都会采用的方式：与其他孩子的父母建立紧密的联系，依靠他们来获取消息。所有人都将自己掌握的信息进行共享，比如，他们一群人去了哪里，是否有成年人陪同。当然，我们的两个女儿也因为她们父亲的身份而背负了额外的责任，她们知道，不论她们惹出什么麻烦，都会立马成为头条新闻。贝拉克和我都意识到这对她们来说非常不公平，因为即使是我们俩，也曾在青春期的时候做过许多越界的、愚蠢的事情，但是，我们比她们幸运，因为当时不论我们做什么，都绝不会引起整个国家的关注。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">From a parent's point of view, it wasn't a bad way to raise teenagers -- knowing that a set of watchful adults was trailing them at all times, tasked with extricating them from any sort of emergency. From a teenager's standpoint, though, this was understandably a complete and total drag. As with many aspects of life in the White House, we were left to sort out what it meant for our family -- where and how to draw the lines, how to balance the requirements of the presidency against the needs of two kids learning how to mature on their own.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从父母的角度来讲，以这样一种方式照顾处于青少年时期的孩子并不是什么坏事—有很多非常警惕的成年人随时跟在孩子们身后，随时能将他们从任何可能发生的紧急情况中解救出来，这无疑非常让人放心。但是，从一名青春期的孩子的角度来讲，这完完全全是多余的。因此，对于在白宫生活的方方面面，我们需要自己来权衡这一切对一个家庭来说究竟意味着什么—我们需要在哪些方面坚决划清界限、如何来划清界限，以及如何在总统职位所附带的各项要求与两个孩子的需求之间找寻平衡，毕竟，她们正在快速成长、正在学着慢慢成熟起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Malia had been eight when Barack sat on the edge of her bed in Chicago and asked if she thought it was okay for him to run for president. I think now of how little she'd known at the time, how little any of us could have known. It meant one thing to be a child in the White House. It meant something different to try to emerge from it as an adult. How could Malia have guessed that she'd have men with guns following her to prom someday? Or that people would take photos of her sneaking a cigarette and sell them to gossipy websites?</div>

<div class="line_en">Our kids were coming of age during what felt like a unique time. Apple had begun selling the iPhone in June 2007, about four months after Barack announced his candidacy for president. A million of them sold in less than three months. A billion of them sold before his second term was over. His was the first presidency of a new era, one involving the disruption and dismantling of all norms around privacy -- involving selfies, data hacks, Snapchats, and Kardashians. Our daughters lived more deeply inside it than we did, in part because social media governed teen life and in part because their routines put them in closer contact with the public than ours did. As Malia and Sasha moved around Washington with their friends after school or on weekends, they'd catch sight of strangers pointing their phones in their direction, or contend with grown men and women asking -- even demanding -- to take a selfie with them. "You do know that I'm a child, right?" Malia would sometimes say when turning someone down.</div>

<div class="line_en">Barack and I did what we could to protect our kids from too much exposure, declining all media requests for them and working to keep their everyday lives largely out of sight. Their Secret Service escorts supported us by trying to be less conspicuous when following the girls around in public, wearing board shorts and T-shirts instead of suits and swapping their earpieces and wrist microphones for earbud headsets, in order to better blend in at the teenage hangouts they now frequented. We strongly disapproved of the publication of any photos of our children that weren't connected to an official event, and the White House press office made this clear to the media. Melissa and others on my team became my enforcers anytime an image of one of the girls surfaced on a gossip site, making haranguing phone calls to get it taken down.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="贝拉克和我一直都竭尽所能，保护我们的两个孩子尽量不暴露在媒体的聚光灯之下，为此，我们拒绝了很多媒体采访她们的请求，并尽量让她们的日常生活处在公众视线之外。负责保护她们安全的特工也给了我们很大的支持，比如，当她们出现在公共场合的时候，特工们会一如既往地跟着她们，但同时会尽量保持低调，比如他们会选择穿沙滩裤和T恤，而不是穿正装，会选择使用耳机，而不使用对讲机、手腕麦克风等显眼的装备，从而避免引起大家的注意，也好让两个孩子更好地融入和伙伴们的聚会当中。当时，玛利亚和萨沙经常和她们的朋友一起出去聚会。除了正式的官方活动之外，我们也坚决反对以任何形式公开两个孩子的任何照片，对此，白宫新闻办公室还专门向各个媒体作了说明。每当有两个孩子的照片出现在八卦网站上时，梅丽莎以及我团队的其他成员都会成为我强有力的助手，态度坚决地与对方进行电话沟通，要求尽快将照片撤下。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Guarding the girls' privacy meant finding other ways to satiate the public's curiosity about our family. Early in Barack's second term, we'd added a new puppy to the household -- Sunny -- a free-spirited rambler who seemed to see no point in being house-trained, given how big her new house was. The dogs added a lightness to everything. They were living, loafing proof that the White House was a home. Knowing that Malia and Sasha were basically off-limits, the White House communications teams began requesting the dogs for official appearances. In the evenings, I'd find memos in my briefing book asking me to approve a "Bo and Sunny Drop-By," allowing the dogs to mingle with members of the media or children coming for a tour. The dogs would get deployed when reporters came to learn about the importance of American trade and exports or, later, to hear Barack speak in favor of Merrick Garland, his pick for the Supreme Court. Bo starred in a promotional video for the Easter Egg Roll. He and Sunny posed with me for photos in an online campaign to urge people to sign up for health-care coverage. They made excellent ambassadors, impervious to criticism and unaware of their own fame.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="保护两个孩子的隐私就意味着，我们需要寻找其他的方法来满足公众对我们一家人的好奇心。在贝拉克第二任期刚刚开始的时候，我们在白宫又迎来了另一只小狗—萨尼，这只幼犬性格自由奔放，丝毫不受约束，看到它的新家如此之大，似乎也就完全没有考虑过要接受入室生活训练。萨尼和阿博的存在使得每一件事情都变得轻松了许多。它们充满活力，活蹦乱跳，到处游荡，想证明白宫就是它们的家。因为玛利亚和萨沙基本不可能接受采访，所以白宫的外联团队要求我们允许阿博和萨尼在正式活动中露面。在晚上阅读简报的时候，我经常会在备忘录上看到要求我同意“阿博和萨尼随行”的请求，他们希望我能让两只狗与媒体或者前来白宫参观的孩子们见面。当有记者来白宫采访，希望了解美国贸易和出口的重要性，或者想听听贝拉克替上诉法院法官梅里克·加兰德—他提名的最高法院大法官—说话时，我们都会派两只狗一同前去。在我们为复活节滚彩蛋活动制作的推广短片中，就是阿博担任了主角。阿博和萨尼还与我一同拍照合影，在网上发起一项运动，呼吁大家为扩大医疗保险覆盖范围签名。阿博和萨尼确实都是很棒的代言人，它们不会受任何批评声音的影响，也从不会关注自己的名声。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Like all kids, Sasha and Malia outgrew things over time. Since the first year of Barack's presidency, they had joined him in front of reporters each fall while he performed what had to be the most ridiculous ritual of the office -- pardoning a live turkey just ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday. For the first five years, they'd smiled and giggled as their dad cracked corny jokes. But by the sixth year, at thirteen and sixteen, they were too old to even pretend it was funny. Within hours of the ceremony, photos of the two of them looking aggrieved appeared all over the internet -- Sasha stone-faced, Malia with her arms crossed -- as they stood next to the president, his lectern, and the oblivious turkey. A USA Today headline summed it up fairly enough: "Malia and Sasha Obama Are So Done with Their Dad's Turkey Pardon."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就如所有孩子一样，随着时间的推移，萨沙和玛利亚逐渐长大，很多事情在她们的身上已经不再适用。自从贝拉克就任美国总统第一年开始，每年秋天，她们都会陪着父亲一起会见记者，举行一项可以说是白宫最为荒唐的总统仪式—在感恩节前夕“大赦”一只火鸡 [1]。在前五年里，当她们的父亲认真履行这项仪式并说一些老掉牙的笑话时，她们俩也会咯咯咯咯地跟着一起笑。但是到了第六个年头的时候，她们都已长大（萨沙十三岁了，玛利亚也已经十六岁了），即使要她们假装这项仪式非常有趣，她们也无法做到。在持续数小时的仪式中，她们俩的照片（一副愤愤不平的样子，像是受了委屈一样）开始在互联网上到处传播—萨沙面无表情，玛利亚双臂交叉站立，身边就是她们的总统父亲、演讲台以及那只不知道发生了什么的火鸡。《今日美国》的一条新闻报道标题将这一场景描述得非常到位—玛利亚和萨沙真是受够了他们父亲的火鸡赦免仪式。【注：[1]美国总统每年感恩节前都会象征性地“赦免”一只火鸡，使它们免于宰杀。而获得赦免的火鸡，会被送到动物园等地，直到自然死亡。】">查看中文翻译</div>

These were happy, well-adjusted teens with lives that were accordingly rich with activities and social intrigue having nothing to do with their parents.

<div class="line_en">There was often music blasting from Malia's room. Sasha and her friends had taken a shine to cable cooking shows and sometimes commandeered the residence kitchen to decorate cookies or whip up elaborate, multicourse meals for themselves. Both our daughters relished the relative anonymity they enjoyed when going on school trips or joining friends' families for vacations (their agents always in tow). Sasha loved nothing more than to pick out her own snacks at Dulles International Airport before boarding a packed commercial flight, for the simple fact that it was so different from the presidential rigmarole that went on at Andrews Air Force Base and had become our family's norm.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛利亚的房间里经常会传出响亮的音乐声，萨沙和她的朋友迷上了有线电视烹饪节目，有时候，她们会霸占我们的白宫厨房去装饰点心或者一时兴起为自己做好多道精致的菜品。不论是平时上学的时候，还是与同学的家庭一起出去度假的时候（当然，她们的特工会全程陪护），两个孩子都喜欢以一种相对匿名的方式出现。萨沙最喜欢做的事情就是：每次在杜勒斯国际机场登上拥挤的商务航班之前，先挑一些自己喜欢的零食。她这一爱好原因其实很简单，因为在她看来，在这里乘坐飞机是一种全新的体验，完全没有安德鲁斯空军基地跟随总统出行那些冗长复杂的程序，而那些程序已经成为我们一家人需要履行的规范。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Traveling with us did have its advantages. Before Barack's presidency was over, our girls would enjoy a baseball game in Havana, walk along the Great Wall of China, and visit the Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio one evening in magical, misty darkness. But it could also be a pain in the neck, especially when we were trying to tend to things unrelated to the presidency. Earlier in Malia's junior year, the two of us had gone to spend a day visiting colleges in New York City, for instance, setting up tours at New York University and Columbia. It had worked fine for a while. We'd moved through NYU's campus at a brisk pace, our efficiency aided by the fact that it was still early and many students were not yet up for the day. We'd checked out classrooms, poked our heads into a dorm room, and chatted with a dean before heading uptown to grab an early lunch and move on to the next tour.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当然，跟随我们一起出行也有很多好处。比如，在贝拉克总统任期还未结束的时候，两个孩子可以和我们一同出访，在哈瓦那观看棒球比赛，在中国爬长城，在巴西里约热内卢夜晚迷人而朦胧的黑暗中观看救世基督像。但是有时候，和我们一起出行确实会让人非常头疼，尤其当我们的行程与总统职务毫不相关时。比如，在玛利亚刚刚上高中的时候，有一天，我们俩计划一起去纽约参观几所大学，当时，我们决定逛逛纽约大学和哥伦比亚大学。刚开始的时候，一切都进行得非常顺利，我们一路非常迅速地、轻松地逛完了纽约大学的校园，可能是因为当时时间还比较早，许多学生还没有起床出来活动。我们参观了学生教室，将脑袋伸进一间学生宿舍看了看，跟一位系主任聊了会儿天，然后出发去住宿区，我们计划早早地吃完午饭，然后前往下一个目的地。">查看中文翻译</div>

Without me there, Malia's odds of being recognized went down. She could move faster and with a lot fewer agents. Without me, she could maybe, possibly, look like just another kid walking the quad. I at least owed her a shot at that.</div>

<div class="line_en">The problem is that there's no hiding a First Lady-sized motorcade, especially on the island of Manhattan in the middle of a weekday. By the time we finished eating, about a hundred people had gathered on the sidewalk outside the restaurant, the commotion only breeding more commotion. We stepped out to find dozens of cell phones hoisted in our direction as we were engulfed by a chorus of cheers. It was beneficent, this attention --"Come to Columbia, Malia!" people were shouting -- but it was not especially useful for a girl who was trying quietly to imagine her own future.</div>

She'd come to my office as a young intern, and along with Kristen Jarvis, who until recently had been my trip director, was instrumental in our family's life, filling some of these strange gaps caused by the intensity of our schedules and the hindering nature of our fame. "The Kristins," as we called them, stood in for us often. They served as liaisons between our family and Sidwell, setting up meetings and interacting with teachers, coaches, and other parents when Barack and I weren't able. With the girls, they were protective, loving, and far hipper than I'd ever be in the eyes of my kids.

<div class="line_en">I tried to think back and remember how it was that my life had forked away from the predictable, control-freak fantasy existence I'd envisioned for myself -- the one with the steady salary, a house to live in forever, a routine to my days. At what point had I chosen away from that? When had I allowed the chaos inside? Had it been on the summer night when I lowered my ice cream cone and leaned in to kiss Barack for the first time? Was it the day I'd finally walked away from my orderly piles of documents and my partner-track career in law, convinced I'd find something more fulfilling?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我拼命地回忆过去，试图回想当初我的生活是如何一步步偏离原来的轨道的。当初，根据我的设想，我的生活应该是事事可以预测、事事都处于我能够控制的状态—稳定的工资收入、一间可以永久居住的房子、每天几乎重复的日程安排。但是，我是什么时候改变了自己的人生方向？我又是什么时候允许我的生活出现混乱的？是在那个夏天的夜晚吗，当时，我放下冰激凌，靠过去第一次亲吻了贝拉克？还是在我选择离开那大摞大摞摆放有序的文件，放弃我律师事务所合伙人的职业规划，并说服自己一定会找到一份更有成就感的工作那天？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">While Malia toured Columbia that afternoon, I was put into a secure holding area designated by the Secret Service -- what turned out to be the basement of an academic building on campus -- where I sat alone and unnoticed until it was time to leave, wishing I'd at least brought a book to read. It hurt a little to be down there, I'll admit. I felt a kind of loneliness that probably had less to do with the fact that I was by myself killing time in a windowless room and more to do with the idea that, like it or not, the future was coming, that our first baby was going to grow up and leave.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天下午，在玛利亚参观哥伦比亚大学的时候，特工处将我安排在一处非常安全的等候区—学校一座教学楼的地下室—为了不引起其他人的注意，我要一个人待在那里。我当时多么希望随身携带一本书，那样起码我还能打发一下时间。我承认，一个人待在地下室确实有点难熬，我突然感到一阵孤独袭来，这种孤独与其说与我当时所处的环境（我独自一人待在一间没有窗户的屋子里）有关，倒不如说是因为我内心那不可抑制的想法—不论我愿不愿意，未来都在朝着我们一步步靠近，我们的大女儿玛利亚即将长大离开我们。">查看中文翻译</div>

Were we going to come out of this intact?</div>

<div class="line_en">My mind sometimes landed back in the church basement in Roseland, on the Far South Side of Chicago, where I'd gone twenty-five years earlier to be with Barack as he spoke to a neighborhood group that was struggling to push back against hopelessness and indifference. Listening to the conversation that evening, I'd heard something familiar articulated in a new way. It was possible, I knew, to live on two planes at once -- to have one's feet planted in reality but pointed in the direction of progress. It was what I'd done as a kid on Euclid Avenue, what my family -- and marginalized people more generally -- had always done. You got somewhere by building that better reality, if at first only in your own mind. Or as Barack had put it that night, you may live in the world as it is, but you can still work to create the world as it should be.</div>

<div class="line_en">Progress was the Centers for Disease Control reporting that childhood obesity rates appeared to be leveling off, particularly among children ages two to five. It was two thousand high school students in Detroit showing up to help me celebrate College Signing Day, a holiday we'd helped expand as a part of Reach Higher, to mark the day when young people committed to their colleges. Progress was the Supreme Court's decision to reject a challenge to a key part of the country's new health-care law, all but ensuring that Barack's signature domestic achievement -- the security of health insurance for every American -- would remain strong and intact once he left office. It was an economy that had been hemorrhaging 800,000 jobs a month when Barack entered the White House having now racked up nearly five straight years of continuous job growth.</div>

<div class="line_en">A year and a half after Newtown, Congress had passed not a single gun-control measure. Bin Laden was gone, but ISIS had arrived. The homicide rate in Chicago was going up rather than down. A black teen named Michael Brown was shot by a cop in Ferguson, Missouri, his body left in the middle of the road for hours. A black teen named Laquan McDonald was shot sixteen times by police in Chicago, including nine times in the back. A black boy named Tamir Rice was shot dead by police in Cleveland while playing with a toy gun. A black man named Freddie Gray died after being neglected in police custody in Baltimore. A black man named Eric Garner was killed by police after being put in a choke hold during his arrest on Staten Island. All this was evidence of something pernicious and unchanging in America. When Barack was first elected, various commentators had naively declared that our country was entering a "postracial" era, in which skin color would no longer matter. Here was proof of how wrong they'd been. As Americans obsessed over the threat of terrorism, many were overlooking the racism and tribalism that were tearing our nation apart.</div>

<div class="line_en">Late in June 2015, Barack and I flew to Charleston, South Carolina, to sit with another grieving community -- this time at the funeral of a pastor named Clementa Pinckney, who had been one of nine people killed in a racially motivated shooting earlier in the month at an African Methodist Episcopal church known simply as Mother Emanuel. The victims, all African Americans, had welcomed an unemployed twenty-one-year-old white man -- a stranger to them all -- into their Bible study group. He'd sat with them for a while; then, after the group bowed their heads in prayer, he stood up and began shooting. In the middle of it, he was reported to have said, "I have to do this, because you rape our women and you're taking over our country."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="2015年6月底，我和贝拉克飞往南卡罗来纳州的查尔斯顿市，与又一个沉浸在悲痛中的社区居民见面座谈—这一次，我们是去参加南卡罗来纳州参议员、牧师平克尼的葬礼。就在当月的17日，在该市一座古老的非洲裔卫理圣公会教堂（当地人昵称为“圣母伊曼纽尔”）内，发生了一起种族仇恨枪击案，导致平克尼牧师在内的九人死亡。所有的受害者都是非洲裔美国人，当天，他们曾热情地将一名二十一岁的失业白人—他们都不认识的一名陌生人—迎入教堂，并同意他参加他们的圣经学习会。这名陌生人先是和他们一起坐着学习，然后，当大家都低头祈祷的时候，他突然站起来朝大家射击。据幸存者回忆，他在射击的时候还大声喊：“你们奸淫我们的姐妹，占领我们的国度，你们必须消失！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After delivering a moving eulogy for Reverend Pinckney and acknowledging the deep tragedy of the moment, Barack surprised everyone by leading the congregation in a slow and soulful rendition of "Amazing Grace." It was a simple invocation of hope, a call to persist. Everyone in the room, it seemed, joined in. For more than six years now, Barack and I had lived with an awareness that we ourselves were a provocation. As minorities across the country were gradually beginning to take on more significant roles in politics, business, and entertainment, our family had become the most prominent example. Our presence in the White House had been celebrated by millions of Americans, but it also contributed to a reactionary sense of fear and resentment among others. The hatred was old and deep and as dangerous as ever.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在平克尼的葬礼上，贝拉克发表了一段感人至深的悼词，承认了我们所面临的悲剧，然后，贝拉克带领大家缓慢而深情地唱起《奇异恩典》 [2]，他的这一举动出乎所有人的意料，他只不过是希望通过这种方式祈求大家依旧心怀希望，呼吁大家一定要在逆境中坚持下去。当时，在场的人都加入了集会。虽然当时贝拉克正式就任美国总统已经有六年多时间，但在那六年多的时间里，我们从来没有忘记过一点：对于一些人来说，我们本身可能就是一种挑衅因素。近些年，美国的少数族裔公民逐渐在政治、经济、娱乐等方面扮演越来越重要的角色，而在这些人当中，我们一家人可以说最为突出。我们住进白宫曾经得到了数百万美国人的祝福，但同时，也激起了其他一些人的恐惧、怨恨，甚至是强烈反对，他们对少数族裔的仇视根深蒂固，而且一如既往地充满危险。【注：[2] 《奇异恩典》（Amazing Grace），也有人称《天赐恩宠》，是美国最脍炙人口的一首乡村福音歌曲，被视为非洲裔美国人对抗种族歧视的象征。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The same day as the funeral service in Charleston -- June 26, 2015-- the Supreme Court of the United States issued a landmark decision, affirming that same-sex couples had the right to marry in all fifty states. This was the culmination of a legal battle that had been fought methodically over decades, state by state, court by court, and as with any civil rights struggle it had required the persistence and courage of many people. On and off over the course of the day, I'd caught reports of Americans overjoyed by the news. A jubilant crowd chanted, "Love has won!" on the steps of the Supreme Court. Couples were flocking to city halls and county courthouses to exercise what was now a constitutional right. Gay bars were opening early. Rainbow flags waved on street corners around the country.</div>

Returning home to the White House, we'd changed out of our funeral clothes, had a quick dinner with the girls, and then Barack had disappeared into the Treaty Room to flip on ESPN and catch up on work.

<div class="line_en">Oftentimes, I was happy to withdraw into the protected hush of the residence at the end of a long day. But this night felt different, as paradoxical as the country itself. After a day spent grieving in Charleston, I was looking at a giant party starting just outside my window. Hundreds of people were staring up at our house. I wanted to see it the way they did.

<div class="line_en">Looking out the window, I saw that beyond the gates on Pennsylvania Avenue, a big crowd of people had gathered in the summer dusk to see the lights. The north drive was filled with government staff who'd stayed late to see the White House transformed in celebration of marriage equality. The decision had touched so many people. From where I stood, I could see the exuberance, but I could hear nothing. It was an odd part of our reality. The White House was a silent, sealed fortress, almost all sound blocked by the thickness of its windows and walls. The Marine One helicopter could land on one side of the house, its rotor blades kicking up gale-force winds and slamming tree branches, but inside the residence we'd hear nothing. I usually figured out that Barack had arrived home from a trip not by the sound of his helicopter but rather by the smell of its fuel, which somehow managed to permeate.</div>

<div class="line_en">I was following the campaign, but not as intently as in years past. Instead, I'd been busy working on my fourth initiative as First Lady, called Let Girls Learn, which Barack and I had launched together back in the spring. It was an ambitious, government-wide effort focused on helping adolescent girls around the world obtain better access to education. Over the course of nearly seven years now as First Lady, I'd been struck again and again by both the promise and the vulnerability of young women in our world -- from the immigrant girls I'd met at the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson School to Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani teenager who'd been brutally attacked by the Taliban and who came to the White House to speak with me, Barack, and Malia about her advocacy on behalf of girls' education. I was horrified when, about six months after Malala's visit, 276 Nigerian schoolgirls were kidnapped by the extremist group Boko Haram, seemingly intent on causing other Nigerian families to fear sending their daughters to school. It had prompted me, for the first and only time during the presidency, to sub for Barack during his weekly address to the nation, speaking emotionally about how we needed to work harder at protecting and encouraging girls worldwide.</div>

<div class="line_en">I felt it all personally. Education had been the primary instrument of change in my own life, my lever upward in the world. I was appalled that many girls -- more than 98 million worldwide, in fact, according to UNESCO statistics -- didn't have access to it. Some girls weren't able to attend school because their families needed them to work. Sometimes the nearest school was far away or too expensive, or the risk of being assaulted while getting there was too great. In many cases, suffocating gender norms and economic forces combined to keep girls uneducated -- effectively locking them out of future opportunities. There seemed to be an idea -- astonishingly prevalent in certain parts of the world -- that it was simply not worth it to put a girl in school, even as studies consistently showed that educating girls and women and allowing them to enter the workforce did nothing but boost a country's GDP.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="说到接受教育这一问题，我有着亲身的体会，教育是我改变自己人生、迈向上层社会的主要途径。然而，有一个事实让我非常震惊，根据联合国教科文组织的数据，全世界范围内有超过九千八百万女童无法接受教育。一些女孩因为她们的家庭需要劳动力而无法上学，一些女孩因为家庭距离学校太远或者学费太过昂贵而无法上学，一些女孩因为上学途中遭遇袭击的风险太大而无法上学。很多情况下，令人窒息的性别规范以及经济因素共同导致女孩不能像男孩一样正常接受教育—她们也因此失去了更多的人生机会以及更丰富多彩的人生。此外，即使多项研究显示，让女童接受教育，或者让成年女性接受教育，并让她们走上社会参加工作毫无坏处，反而会提高一个国家的国内生产总值，但是在世界上一些地区，至今还流行着一种非常惊人的落后观念—送女孩去学校学习是不值得的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Barack and I were committed to changing the perceptions about what made a young woman valuable to a society. He managed to leverage hundreds of millions of dollars in resources from across his administration, through USAID and the Peace Corps, and also through the Departments of State, Labor, and Agriculture. The two of us together lobbied other countries' governments to help fund programming for girls' education while encouraging private companies and think tanks to commit to the cause.</div>

I'd practiced diligently for my karaoke session for weeks, memorizing every beat to every song.

As we had for the last six years, we took time on Christmas Day to visit with service members and their families at a nearby Marine Corps base. And as it had been right through, for Barack the vacation was only a partial vacation -- a just-barely vacation, really. He fielded phone calls, sat for daily briefings, and was consulting with a skeleton staff of advisers, aides, and speechwriters who were all staying at a hotel close by. It made me wonder whether he'd remember how to fully relax when the time actually came, whether either one of us would find a way to let down when this was all over.

<div class="line_en">The last commencement I attended that spring was personal -- Malia's graduation from Sidwell Friends, held on a warm day in June. Our close friend Elizabeth Alexander, the poet who'd written a poem for Barack's first inauguration, spoke to the class, which meant that Barack and I got to sit back and just feel. I was proud of Malia, who was soon to head off to Europe to travel for a few weeks with friends. After taking a gap year, she'd enroll at Harvard. I was proud of Sasha, who turned fifteen that same day and was counting down the hours to the Beyoncé concert she was going to in lieu of a birthday party. She would go on to spend much of the summer on Martha's Vineyard, living with family friends until Barack and I arrived for vacation. She'd make new friends and land her first job, working at a snack bar. I was proud, too, of my mother, who sat nearby in the sunshine, wearing a black dress and heels, having managed to live in the White House and travel the world with us while staying utterly and completely herself.</div>

<div class="line_en">This time, I was stumping for Hillary Clinton, Barack's opponent in the brutal 2008 primary who'd gone on to become his loyal and effective secretary of state. I'd never feel as passionately about another candidate as I did about my own husband, which made campaigning for others sometimes difficult for me. I maintained a code for myself, though, when it came to speaking publicly about anything or anyone in the political sphere: I said only what I absolutely believed and what I absolutely felt.</div>

<div class="line_en">Back in 2008, during Barack's first run for president, I'd rehearsed and re-rehearsed my convention speech until I could place the commas in my sleep, in part because I'd never given a speech on live television like that, and also because the personal stakes felt so high. I was stepping onto the stage after having been demonized as an angry black woman who didn't love her country. My speech that night gave me a chance to humanize myself, explaining who I was in my own voice, slaying the caricatures and stereotypes with my own words. Four years later, at the convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, I'd spoken earnestly about what I'd seen in Barack during his first term -- how he was still the same principled man I'd married, how I'd realized that "being president doesn't change who you are; it reveals who you are."</div>

Then I stepped out and spoke my truth. I talked about the fears I'd had early on about raising our daughters in the White House and how proud I was of the intelligent young women they'd become.

<div class="line_en">Since childhood, I'd believed it was important to speak out against bullies while also not stooping to their level. And to be clear, we were now up against a bully, a man who among other things demeaned minorities and expressed contempt for prisoners of war, challenging the dignity of our country with practically his every utterance. I wanted Americans to understand that words matter -- that the hateful language they heard coming from their TVs did not reflect the true spirit of our country and that we could vote against it. It was dignity I wanted to make an appeal for -- the idea that as a nation we might hold on to the core thing that had sustained my family, going back generations. Dignity had always gotten us through. It was a choice, and not always the easy one, but the people I respected most in life made it again and again, every single day. There was a motto Barack and I tried to live by, and I offered it that night from the stage: When they go low, we go high.</div>

I can hurt you and get away with it. It was an expression of hatred that had generally been kept out of polite company, but still lived in the marrow of our supposedly enlightened society -- alive and accepted enough that someone like Donald Trump could afford to be cavalier about it. Every woman I know recognized it. Every person who's ever been made to feel "other" recognized it.

I'd been mocked and threatened many times now, cut down for being black, female, and vocal. I'd felt the derision directed at my body, the literal space I occupied in the world. I'd watched Donald Trump stalk Hillary Clinton during a debate, following her around as she spoke, standing too close, trying to diminish her presence with his. I can hurt you and get away with it. Women endure entire lifetimes of these indignities -- in the form of catcalls, groping, assault, oppression. These things injure us. They sap our strength. Some of the cuts are so small they're barely visible. Others are huge and gaping, leaving scars that never heal. Either way, they accumulate.

Before I left the White House, I wanted to give it even more permanence. We expanded its footprint to twenty-eight hundred square feet, more than double its original size. We added stone pathways and wooden benches, plus a welcoming arbor made of wood sourced from the estates of Presidents Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe and the childhood home of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. And then, one fall afternoon, I set out across the South Lawn to officially dedicate the garden for posterity.</div>

Six months before the garden dedication, Lin-Manuel Miranda, the young composer I'd met at one of our first arts events, returned to the White House. His hip-hop riff on Alexander Hamilton had exploded into a Broadway sensation, and with it he'd become a global superstar. Hamilton was a musical celebration of America's history and diversity, recasting our understanding of the roles minorities play in our national story, highlighting the importance of women who'd long been overshadowed by powerful men. I'd seen it off-Broadway and loved it so much that I went to see it again when it hit the big stage.

Barack and I sat in the front row, surrounded by young people of all different races and backgrounds, the two of us awash in emotion as Christopher Jackson and Lin-Manuel sang the ballad "One Last Time" as their final number. Here were two artists, one black and one Puerto Rican, standing beneath a 115-year-old chandelier, bracketed by towering antique portraits of George and Martha Washington, singing about feeling "at home in this nation we've made."

<div class="line_en">As we moved toward the end of Barack's presidency, I thought about America this same way. I loved my country for all the ways its story could be told. For almost a decade, I'd been privileged to move through it, experiencing its bracing contradictions and bitter conflicts, its pain and persistent idealism, and above all else its resilience. My view was unusual, perhaps, but I think what I experienced during those years is what many did -- a sense of progress, the comfort of compassion, the joy of watching the unsung and invisible find some light. A glimmer of the world as it could be. This was our bid for permanence: a rising generation that understood what was possible -- and that even more was possible for them. Whatever was coming next, this was a story we could own.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="距离贝拉克的总统任期结束越来越近，我也开始以同样的方式思考美国。我热爱我的国家，我热爱这个国家的方方面面。在过去将近十年的时间里，我有幸能够近距离地感受这个国家的一切，感受它那鲜明对立的矛盾、令人痛苦的冲突、它的痛苦、它坚持不懈的理想，以及它战胜这一切的强大抗逆力。或许，我的观点有点不同寻常，但是我相信，过去这些年里，我的经历、我的认识与很多人是不谋而合的—我们因为见证进步而感欣喜，因为感受到同情而感宽慰，因为看到那些隐形的、无名的人找到了生活的希望而感高兴。哪怕只是一缕微光，我们也希望它可以持续，因为只有这样，正在成长的新一代人才能够意识到他们的未来充满可能，甚至充满更多可能。不管未来发生什么，这将是我们可以掌握的属于自己的故事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I grew up with a disabled dad in a too-small house with not much money in a starting-to-fail neighborhood, and I also grew up surrounded by love and music in a diverse city in a country where an education can take you far. I had nothing or I had everything. It depends on which way you want to tell it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="小时候，我们一家人生活在一个很小的房子里，生活也不富裕，我的父亲身患疾病，而且我们所在的街区已开始衰落。不过，幸运的是，我们一家人相亲相爱，我从小在音乐的熏陶中长大，我们所在的城市芝加哥是一个充满多元文化的城市，我们的国家重视教育，使我可以通过接受教育改变我的命运。你可以说我什么都没有，你也可以说我拥有一切，这完全取决于你选择从哪个角度进行解读。">查看中文翻译</div>
