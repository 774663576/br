<div class="line_en">I asked if Mr Heathcliff were at home? He answered, No; but he would be in at dinner time. It was eleven o'clock, and I announced my intention of going in and waiting for him, at which he immediately flung down his tools and accompanied me, in the office of watchdog, not as a substitute for the host.</div>

<div class="line_en">Yesterday was bright, calm, and frosty. I went to the Heights as I proposed; my housekeeper entreated me to bear a little note from her to her young lady, and I did not refuse, for the worthy woman was not conscious of anything odd in her request. The front door stood open, but the jealous gate was fastened, as at my last visit; I knocked, and invoked Earnshaw from among the garden beds; he unchained it, and I entered. The fellow is as handsome a rustic as need be seen. I took particular notice of him this time; but then he does his best, apparently, to make the least of his advantages.</div>

<div class="line_en">We entered together; Catherine was there, making herself useful in preparing some vegetables for the approaching meal; she looked more sulky and less spirited than when I had seen her first. She hardly raised her eyes to notice me, and continued her employment with the same disregard to common forms of politeness as before; never returning my bow and good morning by the slightest acknowledgment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们一同进去；凯瑟琳在那儿，正在预备蔬菜为午饭时吃，这样她也算是在出力了；她比我第一次见她时显得更阴郁些也更没精神。她简直没抬眼睛看我，像以前一样的不顾一般形式的礼貌，始终没稍微点下头来回答我的鞠躬和问候早安。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Earnshaw surlily bid her remove her things to the kitchen. `Remove them yourself,' she said, pushing them from her as soon as she had done; and retiring to a stool by the window, where she began to carve figures of birds and beasts out of the turnip parings in her lap. I approached her, pretending to desire a view of the garden; and, as I fancied, adroitly dropped Mrs Dean's note on to her knee, unnoticed by Hareton -- but she asked aloud, `What is that?' and chucked it off.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="恩萧执拗地叫她将蔬菜搬到厨房去。“你自己搬吧。”她说，她一弄完就把那些一推；而且在窗前的一张凳子上坐下来，在那儿她用她怀中的萝卜皮开始刻些鸟兽形。我走近她，假装想看看花园景致，而且，依我看来，很灵巧地把丁太太的短笺丢在她的膝盖上了，并没让哈里顿注意到——可是她大声问：“那是什么？”而冷笑着把它丢开了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">`A letter from your old acquaintance, the housekeeper at the Grange,' I answered; annoyed at her exposing my kind deed, and fearful lest it should be imagined a missive of my own. She would gladly have gathered it up at this information, but Hareton beat her; he seized and put it in his waistcoat, saying Mr Heathcliff should look at it first. Thereat, Catherine silently turned her face from us, and, very stealthily, drew out her pocket handkerchief and applied it to her eyes; and her cousin, after struggling a while to keep down his softer feelings, pulled out the letter and flung it on the floor beside her, as ungraciously as he could. Catherine caught and perused it eagerly; then she but a few questions to me concerning the inmates, rational and irrational, of her former home; and gazing towards the hills, murmured in soliloquy:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你的老朋友，田庄管家，写来的信。”我回答，对于她揭穿我的好心的行为颇感烦恼，深怕她把这当作是我自己的信了。她听了这话本可以高兴地拾起它来，可是哈里顿胜过了她。他抓到手，塞在他的背心口袋里，说希刺克厉夫先生得先看看。于是，凯瑟琳默默地转过脸去，而且偷偷地掏出她的手绢，擦着她的眼睛；她的表哥，在为压下他的软心肠挣扎了一番之后，又把信抽出来，十分不客气地丢在她旁边的地板上。凯瑟琳拿到了，热切地读着；然后，她时而清楚时而糊涂地问我几句关于她从前的家的情况；并且呆望着那些小山，喃喃自语着：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">`I was always reading, when I had them,' said Catherine; `and Mr Heathcliff never reads; so he took it into his head to destroy my books. I have not had a glimpse of one for weeks. Only once, I searched through Joseph's store of theology, to his great irritation; and once, Hareton, I came upon a secret stock in your room -- some Latin and Greek, and some tales and poetry: all old friends. I brought the last here -- and you gathered them, as a magpie gathers silver spoons, for the mere love of stealing! They are of no use to you; or else you concealed them in the bad spirit that as you cannot enjoy them nobody else shall. Perhaps your envy counselled Mr Heathcliff to rob me of my treasures? But I've most of them written on my brain and printed in my heart, and you cannot deprive me of those!'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“当我有书的时候，我总是看书，”凯瑟琳说，“而希刺克厉夫从来不看书；所以他就起了念头把我的书毁掉。好几个星期我没有看到一本书了。只有一次，我翻翻约瑟夫藏的宗教书，把他惹得大怒；还有一次，哈里顿，我在你屋里看到一堆秘密藏起来的书——有些拉丁文和希腊文，还有些故事和诗歌：全是老朋友。诗歌是我带来的——你把它们收起来，像喜鹊收集钥匙似的，只是爱偷而已——它们对你并没用；不然就是你恶意把它们藏起来，既然你不能享受，就叫别人也休想。或者是你出于嫉妒，给希刺克厉夫先生出主意把我的珍藏抢去吧？但是大多数的书写在我的脑子里，而且刻在我的心里，你就没法把那些从我这儿夺走！”">查看中文翻译</div>

I wish you would repeat Chevy Chase as you did yesterday: it was extremely funny. I heard you; and I heard you turning over the dictionary to seek out the hard words, and then cursing because you couldn't read their explanations!'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“同时他却要我变成一个呆瓜。”凯瑟琳回答。“是的，我听他自己试着拼音朗读，他搞出多少错来呀！但愿你再念一遍猎歌，像昨天念的那样：那是太可笑了。我听见你念的，我听见你翻字典查生字，然后咒骂着，因为你读不懂那些解释！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The young man evidently thought it too bad that he should be laughed at for his ignorance, and then laughed at for trying to remove it. I had a similar notion; and, remembering Mrs Dean's anecdote of his first attempt at enlightening the darkness in which he had been reared, I observed:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个年轻人显然觉得太糟了，他先是因为愚昧无知而被人人嘲笑，而后为了努力改掉它却又被人嘲笑。我也有类似的看法；我记起丁太太所说的关于他最初曾打算冲破他从小养成的蒙昧的轶事，我就说：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Hareton's chest heaved in silence a minute: he laboured under a severe sense of mortification and wrath, which it was no easy task to suppress. I rose, and, from a gentlemanly idea of relieving his embarrassment, took up my station in the doorway, surveying the external prospect as I stood. He followed my example, and left the room; but presently reappeared, bearing half a dozen volumes in his hands, which he threw into Catherine's lap, exclaiming:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈里顿的胸膛默默地起伏了一下：他是在一种严重的屈辱与愤怒的感觉下苦斗，要压制下去是不容易的事。我站起来，出于一种想解除他的困窘的高尚念头，便站在门口，浏览外面的风景。他随着我的榜样，也离开了这间屋子；但是马上又出现了，手中捧着半打的书，他将它们扔到凯瑟琳的怀里，叫着：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She opened one that had obviously been often turned over, and read a portion in the drawling tone of a beginner; then laughed, and threw it from her. `And listen,' she continued provokingly, commencing a verse of an old ballad in the same fashion.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她打开一本显然常常被翻阅的书，用一个初学者的拖长的声调念了一段，然后大笑，把书丢开。“听着。”她挑衅地说，开始用同样的腔调念一节古歌谣。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But his self-love would endure no further torment: I heard, and not altogether disapprovingly, a manual check given to her saucy tongue. The little wretch had done her utmost to hurt her cousin s sensitive though uncultivated feelings, and a physical argument was the only mode he had of balancing the account, and repaying its effects on the inflicter. He afterwards gathered the books and hurled them on the fire. I read in his countenance what anguish it was to offer that sacrifice to spleen. I fancied that as they consumed, he recalled the pleasure they had already imparted, and the triumph and ever-increasing pleasure he had anticipated from them; and I fancied I guessed the incitement to his secret studies also. He had been content with daily labour and rough animal enjoyments, till Catherine crossed his path. Shame at her scorn, and hope of her approval, were his first prompters to higher pursuits; and, instead of guarding him from one and winning him to the other, his endeavours to rise himself had produced just the contrary result.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是他的自爱使他不会再忍受更多的折磨了。我听见了，而且也不是完全不赞成，一种用手来制止她那傲慢的舌头的方法。这个小坏蛋尽力去伤害她表哥的感情，这感情虽然未经陶冶，却很敏感，体罚是他唯一向加害者清算和报复的方法。哈里顿随后就把这些书收集起来全扔到火里。我从他脸上看出来是怎样的痛苦心情，才能使他在愤怒中献上这个祭品。我猜想，在这些书焚化时，他回味着它们所给过他的欢乐，以及他从这些书中预感到一种得胜的和无止尽的欢乐的感觉。我想我也猜到了是什么在鼓励他秘密研读。他原是满足于日常劳作与粗野的牲口一样的享受的，直到凯瑟琳来到他的生活道路上才改变。因她的轻蔑而感到的羞耻，又希望得到她的赞许，这就是他力求上进的最初动机了，而他那上进的努力，既不能保护他避开轻蔑，也不能使他得到赞许，却产生了恰恰相反的结果。">查看中文翻译</div>
