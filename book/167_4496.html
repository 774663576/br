"Ser Rodrik Cassel and all the lords who have come to his call. I will not run from them. I took this castle and I mean to hold it, to live or die as Prince of Winterfell. But I will not command any man to die with me. If you leave now, before Ser Rodrik's main force is upon us, there's still a chance you may win free."

<div class="line_en">Wex helped garb him for battle. Beneath his black surcoat and golden mantle was a shirt of well-oiled ringmail, and under that a layer of stiff boiled leather. Once armed and armored, Theon climbed the watchtower at the angle where the eastern and southern walls came together to have a look at his doom. The northmen were spreading out to encircle the castle. It was hard to judge their numbers. A thousand at least; perhaps twice that many. Against seventeen. They'd brought catapults and scorpions. He saw no siege towers rumbling up the kingsroad, but there was timber enough in the wolfswood to build as many as were required.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="威克斯为他着装准备战斗。在黑色的外衣和金色的披风下，席恩穿着一件上好油的锁甲衫，其内还套了一层硬皮甲。他全副披挂之后，拿起武器，登上东墙与南墙交汇处的了望塔，好亲眼见证自己的毁灭。北方人正散开队形，包围城堡。从这里很难判断他们的总人数，不过至少有一千——或许是这个数字的两倍。两千对十七。他们带来投石机和弩炮。虽然他还没看见攻城塔自国王大道隆隆而来，但狼林里的木材取之不尽，需要多少就有多少。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Theon studied their banners through Maester Luwin's Myrish lens tube. The Cerwyn battle-axe flapped bravely wherever he looked, and there were Tallhart trees as well, and mermen from White Harbor. Less common were the sigils of Flint and Karstark. Here and there he even saw the bull moose of the Hornwoods. But no Glovers, Asha saw to them, no Boltons from the Dreadfort, no Umbers come down from the shadow of the Wall. Not that they were needed. Soon enough the boy Cley Cerwyn appeared before the gates carrying a peace banner on a tall staff, to announce that Ser Rodrik Cassel wished to parley with Theon Turncloak.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ser Rodrik waited in the market astride his dappled gelding. Beside him, the direwolf of Stark flapped from a staff borne by young Cley Cerwyn. They were alone in the square, though Theon could see archers on the roofs of surrounding houses, spearmen to his right, and to his left a line of mounted knights beneath the merman-and-trident of House Manderly. Every one of them wants me dead. Some were boys he'd drunk with, diced with, even wenched with, but that would not save him if he fell into their hands.</div>

Every dawn and every dusk will mean a death, until you are gone. I have no lack of hostages." He did not wait for a reply, but wheeled Smiler around and rode back toward the castle. He went slowly at first, but the thought of those archers at his back soon drove him to a canter. The small heads watched him come from their spikes, their tarred and flayed faces looming larger with every yard; between them stood little Beth Cassel, noosed and crying. Theon put his heel into Smiler and broke into a hard gallop. Smiler's hooves clattered on the drawbridge, like drumbeats.</div>

<div class="line_en">Theon stared at the flames over the rim of his wine goblet, brooding on the injustice of it all. "I rode beside Robb Stark in the Whispering Wood," he muttered. He had been frightened that night, but not like this. It was one thing to go into battle surrounded by friends, and another to perish alone and despised. Mercy, he thought miserably.</div>

<div class="line_en">A fire had been laid in Ned Stark's bedchamber. Theon sat beside it and filled a cup with a heavy-bodied red from the castle vaults, a wine as sour as his mood. They will attack, he thought gloomily, staring at the flames. Ser Rodrik loves his daughter, but he is still castellan, and most of all a knight. Had it been Theon with a noose around his neck and Lord Balon commanding the army without, the warhorns would already have sounded the attack, he had no doubt. He should thank the gods that Ser Rodrik was not ironborn. The men of the green lands were made of softer stuff, though he was not certain they would prove soft enough.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="奈德·史塔克的卧室升起了火。席恩坐在壁炉边，倒上一杯从酒窖取出的夏日红，只觉酒液和他的心情一样酸败。他们会进攻，他望着火焰，阴郁地想。罗德利克爵士固然疼爱他的女儿，但毕竟身为代理城主，毕竟是个骑士。今天若换成席恩套着绳子在上，巴隆大王指挥军队在下，只怕进攻的号角早就吹响，他对此毫不怀疑。感谢神灵，罗德利克爵士并非铁种，青绿之地的人乃是用柔弱质材所塑造——但他不确定他们是否柔弱到屈服的程度。">查看中文翻译</div>

There he stood, loosing shaft after shaft at the archery butts until his shoulders ached and his fingers were bloody, pausing only long enough to pull the arrows from the targets for another round. I saved Bran's life with this bow, he reminded himself. Would that I could save my own. Women came to the well, but did not linger; whatever they saw on Theon's face sent them away quickly.</div>

<div class="line_en">Behind him the broken tower stood, its summit as jagged as a crown where fire had collapsed the upper stories long ago. As the sun moved, the shadow of the tower moved as well, gradually lengthening, a black arm reaching out for Theon Greyjoy. By the time the sun touched the wall, he was in its grasp. If I hang the girl, the northmen will attack at once, he thought as he loosed a shaft. If I do not hang her, they will know my threats are empty. He knocked another arrow to his bow. There is no way out, none.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="黑罗伦来到身边，静静地站了一会儿。夕阳西垂，给田野和房屋镀上一层红光。一声细微而颤抖的惨叫回荡在城墙之上，一阵绵长的号角在燃烧的房屋背后悠悠奏响。席恩望见一个伤兵拖着身子，痛苦万分地爬过战场，挣扎着前往市集中心的水井，生命之血在污泥尘土中留下一条细长的红线。爬到之前，他便死了。此人穿着皮甲和圆锥形的半盔，但看到不到徽章，不知他为谁而战。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As the night grew darker and the smoke spread it was harder to make out what was happening below, but the din of steel gradually diminished to nothing, and the shouts and warhorns gave way to moans and piteous wailing. Finally a column of mounted men rode out of the drifting smoke. At their head was a knight in dark armor. His rounded helm gleamed a sullen red, and a pale pink cloak streamed from his shoulders. Outside the main gate he reined up, and one of his men shouted for the castle to open.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="夜色渐浓，烟雾弥漫，下方的战况愈来愈混沌，只听金铁交击声逐渐减低，呼喝和号声让位于呻吟与哀嚎。最后，一队人马从浓雾中奔出，为首的骑士全身黑甲，头顶的圆盔闪着暗红的光芒，淡红披风在肩头飞舞。此人在城门前勒马，他的一位手下高声叫门。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Dreadfort men made their way across the moat and through the inner gates. Theon descended with Black Lorren and Maester Luwin to meet them in the yard. Pale red permons trailed from the ends of a few lances, but many more carried battle-axes and greatswords and shields hacked half to splinters. "How many men did you lose?" Theon asked Red Helm as he dismounted.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Aye, but he thought us friends. A common mistake. When the old fool gave me his hand, I took half his arm instead. Then I let him see my face." The man put both hands to his helm and lifted it off his head, holding it in the crook of his arm.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是啊，可他以为我们是盟友。一个常人易犯的错误。这老笨蛋朝我伸手时，我一刀把它宰成两半，然后让他看了我的脸。”骑士双手举起头盔，高抬过顶，夹在腋下。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Twenty or thirty." The torchlight glittered off the chipped enamel of his visor. His helm and gorget were wrought in the shape of a man's face and shoulders, skinless and bloody, mouth open in a silent howl of anguish.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“二三十个吧。”火炬的光芒映在他面甲破损的瓷釉上。他的头盔和颈甲被锻成人脸人肩的形状——剥去皮肤，鲜血淋漓，张开的大口似乎在发出极端痛苦的无声狂啸。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The man laughed. "The wretch is dead." He stepped closer. "The girl's fault. If she had not run so far, his horse would not have lamed, and we might have been able to flee. I gave him mine when I saw the riders from the ridge. I was done with her by then, and he liked to take his turn while they were still warm. I had to pull him off her and shove my clothes into his hands-calfskin boots and velvet doublet, silver-chased swordbelt, even my sable cloak. Ride for the Dreadfort, I told him, bring all the help you can. Take my horse, he's swifter, and here, wear the ring my father gave me, so they'll know you came from me. He'd learned better than to question me. By the time they put that arrow through his back, I'd smeared myself with the girl's filth and dressed in his rags. They might have hanged me anyway, but it was the only chance I saw." He rubbed the back of his hand across his mouth. "And now, my sweet prince, there was a woman promised me, if I brought two hundred men. Well, I brought three times as many, and no green boys nor fieldhands neither, but my father's own garrison."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对方哈哈大笑。“那可怜虫早死了。”他踱上一步。“都是那女孩的错，她不跑那么快，他的马便不会折腿，我们就可以成功脱逃。我看见山坡顶上骑兵出现，便把自己的马让给了他。当时我先干完，轮到他，他喜欢趁温热的时候动手，结果我不得不强行将他推开，并把自己的衣服交到他手中——小牛皮靴、天鹅绒上衣、银丝剑带以及黑貂披风。快回恐怖堡，我吩咐他，把能找到的救兵都带来。‘快来，骑我的马，它跑得快；这个戴上，这是父亲给我的指环，如此部下们准能相信你受我委托。’他没多问，知道我的话不容置疑。于是我一面看着他被射杀，一面用女孩的污秽为自己制造气味，并穿上他的烂衣服。其实我也知道，他们很可能当即吊死我，但这毕竟是惟一的机会。”他用手背擦擦嘴。“现在嘛，我亲爱的亲王殿下，您不是许给我一个姑娘么？——假如我带来两百援兵的话。呵呵，如今我带来三倍的人手，他们可不是什么新手菜鸟或乡野匹夫，全是父亲留下的精锐部队哪。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sometime later, Theon found himself on the ground. He rolled onto his stomach and swallowed a mouthful of blood. Close the gates! he tried to shout, but it was too late. The Dreadfort men had cut down Red Rolfe and Kenned, and more were pouring through, a river of mail and sharp swords. There was a ringing in his ears, and horror all around him. Black Lorren had his sword out, but there were already four of them pressing in on him. He saw Ulf go down with a crossbow bolt through the belly as he ran for the Great Hall. Maester Luwin was trying to reach him when a knight on a warhorse planted a spear between his shoulders, then swung back to ride over him. Another man whipped a torch round and round his head and then lofted it toward the thatched roof of the stables. "Save me the Freys," the Bastard was shouting as the flames roared upward, "and burn the rest. Burn it, burn it all."</div>
