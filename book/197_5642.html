<div class="line_en">But something happened in their first lesson, Transfiguration, that drove the Chamber of Secrets out of their minds for the first time in weeks. Ten minutes into the class, Professor McGonagall told them that their exams would start on the first of June, one week from today.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，就在上午第一节的变形课上，发生了一件事情，使他们几个星期来第一次把密室的事忘到了脑后。麦格教授走进教室刚刚十分钟，就告诉他们说，考试将于六月一日举行，离今天只有短短一个星期了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was a loud bang behind Harry as Neville Longbottom's wand slipped, vanishing one of the legs on his desk. Professor McGonagall restored it with a wave of her own wand, and turned, frowning, to Seamus.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="啷！哈利后面传来一声巨响，纳威隆巴顿的魔杖从手里滑落，使课桌的一条腿突然消失了。麦格教授用她自己的魔杖一挥，又把桌腿安了上去，然后她转过身来，朝西莫皱起了眉头。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Of the many fearsome beasts and monsters that roam our land, there is none more curious or more deadly than the Basilisk, known also as the King of Serpents. This snake, which may reach gigantic size and live many hundreds of years, is born from a chicken's egg, hatched beneath a toad. Its methods of killing are most wondrous, for aside from its deadly and venomous fangs, the Basilisk has a murderous stare, and all who are fixed with the beam of its eye shall suffer instant death. Spiders flee before the Basilisk, for it is their mortal enemy, and the Basilisk flees only from the crowing of the rooster, which is fatal to it.</div>

<div class="line_en">He raised Ron's Spellotaped wand high over his head and yelled, "Obliviate!"</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry looked up at the tunnel ceiling. Huge cracks had appeared in it. He had never tried to break apart anything as large as these rocks by magic, and now didn't seem a good moment to try -- what if the whole tunnel caved in?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利抬头望望隧道的天花板，那里出现了几道巨大的裂口。他从来没有试过用魔法分开像这些岩石这么大的东西，而现在进行尝试似乎不太合适——万一整个隧道都塌下来呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The wand exploded with the force of a small bomb. Harry flung his arms over his head and ran, slipping over the coils of snake skin, out of the way of great chunks of tunnel ceiling that were thundering to the floor. Next moment, he was standing alone, gazing at a solid wall of broken rock.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="嘭！魔杖突然爆炸了，其威力不亚于一枚小炸弹。哈利用胳膊护住脑袋，撒腿就跑，被盘绕着的蛇皮绊倒，躲过了从隧道天花板崩落到地面上的大块碎石。然后，他站起来，独自面对着一堵厚厚的碎石墙。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The adventure ends here, boys!" he said. "I shall take a bit of this skin back up to the school, tell them I was too late to save the girl, and that you two tragically lost your minds at the sight of her mangled body -- say good-bye to your memories!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“孩子们，你们的冒险到此结束了！”他说，“我要把这张皮带到学校去，对他们说，我来晚了，没能救得了那个姑娘，而你们一看见她血肉模糊的尸体，就令人痛心地丧失了理智。“向你们的记忆告别吧！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Soon the distant noise of Ron straining to shift the rocks was gone. The tunnel turned and turned again. Every nerve in Harry's body was tingling unpleasantly. He wanted the tunnel to end, yet dreaded what he'd find when it did. And then, at last, as he crept around yet another bend, he saw a solid wall ahead on which two entwined serpents were carved, their eyes set with great, glinting emeralds.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="很快，罗恩吭哧吭哧搬石头的声音听不见了。隧道转了一个弯又一个弯。哈利的每一根神经都在很不舒服地颤抖着。他希望快点走到隧道的尽头，同时又害怕隧道真的到了尽头。最后，他小心地转过又一个弯道，终于发现前面立着一堵结结实实的墙，上面刻着两条互相缠绕的蛇，它们的眼睛里镶着大大的、闪闪发亮的绿宝石。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"See you in a bit," said Harry, trying to inject some confidence into his shaking voice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“待会儿见。”哈利说，他努力给自己颤抖的声音里注入一些自信。">查看中文翻译</div>
