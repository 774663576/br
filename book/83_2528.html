<div class="line_en">The gentle-eyed, horse-faced maid let me into the long gray and white upstairs sitting room with the ivory drapes tumbled extravagantly on the floor and the white carpet from wall to wall. A screen star's boudoir, a place of charm and seduction, artificial as a wooden leg. It was empty at the moment. The door closed behind me with the unnatural softness of a hospital door. A breakfast table on wheels stood by the chaise-longue. Its silver glittered. There were cigarette ashes in the coffee cup. I sat down and waited.</div>

She blew pale gray smoke upwards and watched it float towards the ceiling and come apart in wisps that were for a little while distinguishable from the air and then melted and were nothing. Then very slowly she lowered her eyes and gave me a cool hard glance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我一言不发。她坐立难安起来。她挪到了一张靠墙的矮脚软垫椅上，头往后一靠，枕着椅背上的一只白色软垫。她向上吐出灰白色的烟，看着它慢慢升到天花板，散成一缕一缕——起初同空气还依稀可辨，后来便融为一体，渺无踪影了。她慢慢垂下眼帘，向我投来冷酷的一瞥。">查看中文翻译</div>

I went down to speak to her because I had something that belonged to her. A little revolver Owen Taylor gave her once. She took it over to Brody's place the other evening, the evening he was killed. I had to take it away from her there. I didn't mention it, so perhaps you didn't know it."</div>

<div class="line_en">"I'm not joking, and if I seem to talk in circles, it just seems that way. It all ties together -- everything. Geiger and his cute little blackmail tricks, Brody and his pictures, Eddie Mars and his roulette tables, Canino and the girl Rusty Regan didn't run away with. It all ties together."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我没在开玩笑，如果我说话像在兜圈子，只是表象。一切都联系起来了——每一件事。盖革和他可爱的敲竹杠小伎俩，布罗迪和他的照片，艾迪·马尔斯和他的轮盘赌桌，卡尼诺和那个并没有与拉斯蒂·里根私奔的姑娘。一切都联系起来了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The ladies seem to --" She stopped dead and whitened. "I can't joke about it," she said simply.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“女士们似乎——”她突然愣住了，脸色煞白。“我没法拿这个开玩笑。”她简单地说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Suppose you did -- it would be something like this. Geiger got his hooks into your sister, which isn't very difficult, and got some notes from her and tried to blackmail your father with them, in a nice way. Eddie Mars was behind Geiger, protecting him and using him for a cat's-paw. Your father sent for me instead of paying up, which showed he wasn't scared about anything. Eddie Mars wanted to know that. He had something on you and he wanted to know if he had it on the General too. If he had, he could collect a lot of money in a hurry. If not, he would have to wait until you got your share of the family fortune, and in the meantime be satisfied with whatever spare cash he could take away from you across the roulette table. Geiger was killed by Owen Taylor, who was in love with your silly little sister and didn't like the kind of games Geiger played with her. That didn't mean anything to Eddie. He was playing a deeper game than Geiger knew anything about, or than Brody knew anything about, or anybody except you and Eddie and a tough guy named Canino. Your husband disappeared and Eddie, knowing everybody knew there had been bad blood between him and Regan, hid his wife out at Realito and put Canino to guard her, so that it would look as if she had run away with Regan. He even got Regan's car into the garage of the place where Mona Mars had been living. But that sounds a little silly taken merely as an attempt to divert suspicion that Eddie had killed your husband or had him killed. It isn't so silly, really. He had another motive. He was playing for a million or so. He knew where Regan had gone and why and he didn't want the police to have to find out. He wanted them to have an explanation of the disappearance that would keep them satisfied. Am I boring you?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“就当你不知道吧——事情是这样的。盖革先把你妹妹骗去了他那儿，这不难办到。然后用她写的几张欠条勒索你父亲，方式挺体面的。艾迪·马尔斯是幕后黑手，保护盖革，也利用他干脏活。你父亲没有付钱，而是把我找了来，说明他什么也不怕。艾迪·马尔斯想确定这一点。他抓住了你的把柄，想弄清楚有没有抓住将军的把柄。如果有，他就能轻易弄到一大笔钱。如果没有，他就只好等你分到家族的财产，暂时满足于你在轮盘赌桌上输给他的小钱，能赚一点是一点。盖革是被欧文·泰勒杀死的，泰勒深爱着你的傻妹妹，很反感盖革那样捉弄她。对于艾迪来说，这些都不值一提。他在下一盘大棋，盖革一无所知，布罗迪也一无所知，除了你、艾迪，还有一个名叫卡尼诺的壮汉外，谁都不知道内情。你丈夫不见了，艾迪知道大家都知道他跟里根之间有恩怨，所以把他妻子藏在了里阿利特，让卡尼诺看着她，这样一来，就造成了她和里根私奔的假象。他甚至将里根的车停到了莫娜·马尔斯之前住处的车库里。如果仅仅是为了转移对艾迪杀了你丈夫的怀疑的话，这一招听起来有点傻。其实并不傻。他有别的动机。他是要干一票上百万的生意。他知道里根去了哪里、怎么会不见的，可他不希望警察查出原委。他希望他们能得到一个满意的答案来解释里根为什么会不见。听得无聊了吧？”">查看中文翻译</div>

That would be what Mr. Canino got for disposing of the body when you went to Eddie Mars for help. But that would be small change to what Eddie expects to collect one of these days, wouldn't it?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我点点头。“这数目差不多。查出来就是这个数。卡门开枪打死拉斯蒂的时候他身上就装了这点钱。艾迪·马尔斯应你的请求，派卡尼诺来处理尸体，他的报酬也是这点钱。但比起艾迪盼着有朝一日可以到手的数额来，这笔钱只是个零头，对吧？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Uh-huh. I'm a very smart guy. I haven't a feeling or a scruple in the world. All I have the itch for is money. I am so money greedy that for twenty-five bucks a day and expenses, mostly gasoline and whiskey, I do my thinking myself, what there is of it; I risk my whole future, the hatred of the cops and of Eddie Mars and his pals, I dodge bullets and eat saps, and say thank you very much, if you have any more trouble, I hope you'll think of me, I'll just leave one of my cards in case anything comes up. I do all this for twenty-five bucks a day -- and maybe just a little to protect what little pride a broken and sick old man has left in his blood, in the thought that his blood is not poison, and that although his two little girls are a trifle wild, as many nice girls are these days, they are not perverts or killers. And that makes me a son of a bitch. All right. I don't care anything about that. I've been called that by people of all sizes and shapes, including your little sister. She called me worse than that for not getting into bed with her. I got five hundred dollars from your father, which I didn't ask for, but he can afford to give it to me. I can get another thousand for finding Mr. Rusty Regan, if I could find him. Now you offer me fifteen grand. That makes me a big shot. With fifteen grand I could own a home and a new car and four suits of clothes. I might even take a vacation without worrying about losing a case. That's fine. What are you offering it to me for? Can I go on being a son of a bitch, or do I have to become a gentleman, like that lush that passed out in his car the other night?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嗯——哼。我脑子很好使。我不讲感情也无所顾忌。我只在乎钱。我是如此贪钱，为了二十五块钱一天和多数花在加油及喝酒上的其他花销，我甘愿独自研究案子的所有细节；我赌上我的整个未来，承受着警察和艾迪·马尔斯及其手下的恨意，我躲避子弹，挨铁棍暴打，还说道，非常感谢，如果你还有别的麻烦，希望能想到我，我留一张名片给你吧，万一有事呢。我做这一切就为了二十五块钱一天——也许只再要一点钱来保护一个伤心欲绝、疾病缠身的老人血液里仅存的那一丝尊严，我认为他的血不是毒液，尽管他的两个小女儿有点管不住，总还不是性变态和杀人犯。这让我成了个狗娘养的。没关系。对此我一点也不在乎。各种身材各种样子的人都用这话骂过我，包括你的小妹妹。因为我不肯跟她上床，她骂我的话比这个还难听。我从你父亲那里拿到了五百块，我并没有问他要，不过他付得起。如果我能找到里根，那就又能拿到一千块。现在你要给我一万五千块。这下我变成大亨了。有了一万五千块，我可以买一套房子、一辆新车和四套衣服。没准我甚至可以度个假，不用担心错过一桩案子。棒极了。你付这笔钱是要我干吗来着？我可以继续当狗娘养的吗？还是非得做一个绅士，就像那天晚上烂在车里的那个醉鬼一样？”">查看中文翻译</div>

She's not normal. I knew the police would get it all out of her. In a little while she would even brag about it. And if dad knew, he would call them instantly and tell them the whole story. And sometime in that night he would die. It's not his dying -- it's what he would be thinking just before he died. Rusty wasn't a bad fellow. I didn't love him. He was all right, I guess. He just didn't mean anything to me, one way or another, alive or dead, compared with keeping it from dad."</div>

<div class="line_en">She got up and walked slowly to the windows. The drapes lay in heavy ivory folds beside her feet. She stood among the folds and looked out, towards the quiet darkish foothills. She stood motionless, almost blending into the drapes. Her hands hung loose at her sides. Utterly motionless hands. She turned and came back along the room and walked past me blindly. When she was behind me she caught her breath sharply and spoke.</div>

<div class="line_en">What did it matter where you lay once you were dead? In a dirty sump or in a marble tower on top of a high hill? You were dead, you were sleeping the big sleep, you were not bothered by things like that. Oil and water were the same as wind and air to you. You just slept the big sleep, not caring about the nastiness of how you died or where you fell. Me, I was part of the nastiness now. Far more a part of it than Rusty Regan was. But the old man didn't have to be. He could lie quiet in his canopied bed, with his bloodless hands folded on the sheet, waiting. His heart was a brief, uncertain murmur. His thoughts were as gray as ashes. And in a little while he too, like Rusty Regan, would be sleeping the big sleep.</div>
