<div class="line_en">There was a knock at the door and a troop of children came in. They were clean and tidy, now. their faces shone with soap, and their hair was plastered down; they were going to Sunday school under Sally's charge. Athelny joked with them in his dramatic, exuberant fashion, and you could see that he was devoted to them all. His pride in their good health and their good looks was touching. Philip felt that they were a little shy in his presence, and when their father sent them off they fled from the room in evident relief. In a few minutes Mrs. Athelny appeared. She had taken her hair out of the curling pins and now wore an elaborate fringe. She had on a plain black dress, a hat with cheap flowers, and was forcing her hands, red and coarse from much work, into black kid gloves.</div>

<div class="line_en">"If they're beautiful I don't much mind if they're not true. It's asking a great deal that things should appeal to your reason as well as to your sense of the aesthetic. I wanted Betty to become a Roman Catholic, I should have liked to see her converted in a crown of paper flowers, but she's hopelessly Protestant. Besides, religion is a matter of temperament; you will believe anything if you have the religious turn of mind, and if you haven't it doesn't matter what beliefs were instilled into you, you will grow out of them. Perhaps religion is the best school of morality. It is like one of those drugs you gentlemen use in medicine which carries another in solution: it is of no efficacy in itself, but enables the other to be absorbed. You take your morality because it is combined with religion; you lose the religion and the morality stays behind. A man is more likely to be a good man if he has learned goodness through the love of God than through a perusal of Herbert Spencer."</div>

<div class="line_en">This was contrary to all Philip's ideas. He still looked upon Christianity as a degrading bondage that must be cast away at any cost; it was connected subconsciously in his mind with the dreary services in the cathedral at Tercanbury, and the long hours of boredom in the cold church at Blackstable; and the morality of which Athelny spoke was to him no more than a part of the religion which a halting intelligence preserved, when it had laid aside the beliefs which alone made it reasonable. But while he was meditating a reply Athelny, more interested in hearing himself speak than in discussion, broke into a tirade upon Roman Catholicism. For him it was an essential part of Spain; and Spain meant much to him, because he had escaped to it from the conventionality which during his married life he had found so irksome. With large gestures and in the emphatic tone which made what he said so striking, Athelny described to Philip the Spanish cathedrals with their vast dark spaces, the massive gold of the altar-pieces, and the sumptuous iron-work, gilt and faded, the air laden with incense, the silence: Philip almost saw the Canons in their short surplices of lawn, the acolytes in red, passing from the sacristy to the choir; he almost heard the monotonous chanting of vespers. The names which Athelny mentioned, Avila, Tarragona, Saragossa, Segovia, Cordova, were like trumpets in his heart. He seemed to see the great gray piles of granite set in old Spanish towns amid a landscape tawny, wild, and windswept.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿西尔尼的观点和菲利普的想法全然相悖。基督教在他眼中依旧是一副不堪的枷锁，应该不惜任何代价抛之弃之。他潜意识里把宗教和特坎伯雷及布莱克斯塔布尔教堂里的冗繁无趣的仪式联系起来。阿西尔尼口中的道德观对他来说也莫过于宗教的一部分。道德的合理性是建立在信仰的基础上。犹豫不定的人可能会抛弃信仰，但道德会留存下来。菲利普正想着要怎么回话呢，阿西尔尼已经自顾自地继续大谈起罗马天主教来了。他喜欢把自己的想法大吐为快，对别人的参与讨论并不怎么感兴趣。在他看来，罗马天主教是西班牙相当重要的一部分。西班牙又对他相当重要。当年他来到这里，是为了逃避婚后那种令人生厌、一成不变的生活。只见他的双手在空中划着大圈，说话一字一顿，形容着西班牙大教堂里黑黢黢的厅廊，祭坛饰画上泼洒的大片金色颜料，奢侈华丽的镀金铁艺颜色已褪得斑驳，空气里弥漫着香火的味道，四下一片静谧；菲利普似乎看到穿着白色法衣的牧师和身边一袭红衣的助手从圣器室朝唱诗班走来；听到他们一遍一遍吟唱着晚祷诗。阿维拉、塔拉戈约、塞戈维亚、科尔多瓦，阿西尔尼每提到一个地名就会在他心里激起一阵回响。他的眼前似乎浮现出古老的西班牙城镇来，灰色的花岗岩石壁掩映在一片昏黄之中，极目萧索，风沙遍野。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Seville!" cried Athelny. "No, no, don't go there. Seville: it brings to the mind girls dancing with castanets, singing in gardens by the Guadalquivir, bull-fights, orange-blossom, mantillas, mantones de Manila. It is the Spain of comic opera and Montmartre. Its facile charm can offer permanent entertainment only to an intelligence which is superficial. Theophile Gautier got out of Seville all that it has to offer. We who come after him can only repeat his sensations. He put large fat hands on the obvious and there is nothing but the obvious there; and it is all finger-marked and frayed. Murillo is its painter."</div>

<div class="line_en">Philip dragged his chair forward, and Athelny set the photograph before him. He looked at it curiously, for a long time, in silence. He stretched out his hand for other photographs, and Athelny passed them to him. He had never before seen the work of that enigmatic master; and at the first glance he was bothered by the arbitrary drawing: the figures were extraordinarily elongated; the heads were very small; the attitudes were extravagant. This was not realism, and yet, and yet even in the photographs you had the impression of a troubling reality. Athelny was describing eagerly, with vivid phrases, but Philip only heard vaguely what he said. He was puzzled. He was curiously moved. These pictures seemed to offer some meaning to him, but he did not know what the meaning was. There were portraits of men with large, melancholy eyes which seemed to say you knew not what; there were long monks in the Franciscan habit or in the Dominican, with distraught faces, making gestures whose sense escaped you; there was an Assumption of the Virgin; there was a Crucifixion in which the painter by some magic of feeling had been able to suggest that the flesh of Christ's dead body was not human flesh only but divine; and there was an Ascension in which the Saviour seemed to surge up towards the empyrean and yet to stand upon the air as steadily as though it were solid ground: the uplifted arms of the Apostles, the sweep of their draperies, their ecstatic gestures, gave an impression of exultation and of holy joy. The background of nearly all was the sky by night, the dark night of the soul, with wild clouds swept by strange winds of hell and lit luridly by an uneasy moon.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="菲利普往前拉了拉椅子，阿西尔尼把照片放他面前。他好奇地看看，没做评价，又伸手要看看其他的，阿西尔尼把剩下的都递过来。他之前从没看过这位杰出大师的作品，初见，先是被画面上随意、古怪的形象困惑住了。画中的人高瘦得出奇，脑袋非常小，摆着夸张做作的姿势。这显然不是写实的作品，可即便是透过照片也能感受到一种古怪的真实感。阿西尔尼迫不及待地解说着，用了不少生动形象的形容，可菲利普只是模糊地听了个大概。他不懂，可他却莫名奇妙地被这些画触动了。好像这几幅画对他而言有某种特殊的意义，尽管究竟是什么他也说不清道不明。肖像画里的男人瞪着硕大的、满是忧伤的眼睛，似乎在诉说着那些你不知道的事情。穿着方济各会或多明我会修道服的修士一脸焦虑，做着不知道是何含义的手势。还有一张圣母升天图，一张耶稣受难图，画家在这幅画里笔触奇特，传达出的神秘情感使人觉得耶稣死后的身体不是人的肉体，而是神圣之躯。再往后翻，看到一张耶稣升天图，画里的救世主腾空而起，升上天堂，脚下的空气仿佛化为结实的土地。使徒们高举的手臂、挥舞的衣袖、激动的模样，给人留下一种神圣而喜悦的印象。背景里近乎满幅都是夜空，漆黑得如灵魂的夜；来自地狱的阴风肆虐，怒云翻腾，映着妖异的月轮，呈现出斑斓的色彩。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Philip remembered how Clutton had been affected by this strange master, whose work he now saw for the first time. He thought that Clutton was the most interesting of all the people he had known in Paris. His sardonic manner, his hostile aloofness, had made it difficult to know him; but it seemed to Philip, looking back, that there had been in him a tragic force, which sought vainly to express itself in painting. He was a man of unusual character, mystical after the fashion of a time that had no leaning to mysticism, who was impatient with life because he found himself unable to say the things which the obscure impulses of his heart suggested. His intellect was not fashioned to the uses of the spirit. It was not surprising that he felt a deep sympathy with the Greek who had devised a new technique to express the yearnings of his soul. Philip looked again at the series of portraits of Spanish gentlemen, with ruffles and pointed beards, their faces pale against the sober black of their clothes and the darkness of the background. El Greco was the painter of the soul; and these gentlemen, wan and wasted, not by exhaustion but by restraint, with their tortured minds, seem to walk unaware of the beauty of the world; for their eyes look only in their hearts, and they are dazzled by the glory of the unseen. No painter has shown more pitilessly that the world is but a place of passage. The souls of the men he painted speak their strange longings through their eyes: their senses are miraculously acute, not for sounds and odours and colour, but for the very subtle sensations of the soul. The noble walks with the monkish heart within him, and his eyes see things which saints in their cells see too, and he is unastounded. His lips are not lips that smile.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="菲利普想起克拉顿曾一度被这个陌生的画坛大师迷倒，直到今天他才第一次看到他的画作。克拉顿是他在巴黎结识的人里最有趣的一个。他冷嘲热讽的态度和充满敌意的冷漠总是拒人于千里之外，但菲利普事后再想，却发现在他身上有种可悲的力量，企图通过画笔表现，可无奈一切都是徒劳。他的个性和一般人不同，明明身处一个毫不崇尚神秘主义的时代，却偏要表现得神秘兮兮。他对自己的生活很不耐烦，因为他发现自己无法表达出那些心中朦胧的冲动。他的头脑总是跟不上精神的步伐。难怪他能与埃尔·格列柯感同身受，是因为这个希腊人发现了一种表达灵魂诉求的新途径啊。菲利普重又看了一遍他给几个西班牙男人画的肖像。画中的人都长着乱蓬蓬、尖刺刺的胡子，在暗色背景和朴素的黑衣的映衬下，脸色苍白得如同死灰。埃尔·格列柯描绘出的是人的灵魂：这些男人或忧郁或颓废，并不是因为身体的劳累，只是由于精神的自我克制；他们的思想深受磨难，对这大千世界中的种种美好恍若未觉。他们的眼睛只注视着自己的内心，因为那些看不见的光芒让他们眼花目眩。还没有一个画家能像埃尔·格列柯一样如此冷漠，如此无情，将这世界的样子呈为一段艰难困苦的旅程。画中人的眼睛诉说出他们千奇百怪的渴望，他们的感觉敏锐得令人难以置信，不仅是对声音、气味或是颜色，甚至对灵魂每次微弱的颤动都大有体会。这位伟大的画家有一颗虔诚的、修道士一样的心脏。他的眼睛能看到密室中的圣徒所看到的东西，可他并不吃惊，嘴唇上也没有笑容。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Philip, silent still, returned to the photograph of Toledo, which seemed to him the most arresting picture of them all. He could not take his eyes off it. He felt strangely that he was on the threshold of some new discovery in life. He was tremulous with a sense of adventure. He thought for an instant of the love that had consumed him: love seemed very trivial beside the excitement which now leaped in his heart. The picture he looked at was a long one, with houses crowded upon a hill; in one corner a boy was holding a large map of the town; in another was a classical figure representing the river Tagus; and in the sky was the Virgin surrounded by angels. It was a landscape alien to all Philip's notion, for he had lived in circles that worshipped exact realism; and yet here again, strangely to himself, he felt a reality greater than any achieved by the masters in whose steps humbly he had sought to walk. He heard Athelny say that the representation was so precise that when the citizens of Toledo came to look at the picture they recognised their houses. The painter had painted exactly what he saw but he had seen with the eyes of the spirit. There was something unearthly in that city of pale gray. It was a city of the soul seen by a wan light that was neither that of night nor day. It stood on a green hill, but of a green not of this world, and it was surrounded by massive walls and bastions to be stormed by no machines or engines of man's invention, but by prayer and fasting, by contrite sighs and by mortifications of the flesh. It was a stronghold of God. Those gray houses were made of no stone known to masons, there was something terrifying in their aspect, and you did not know what men might live in them. You might walk through the streets and be unamazed to find them all deserted, and yet not empty; for you felt a presence invisible and yet manifest to every inner sense. It was a mystical city in which the imagination faltered like one who steps out of the light into darkness; the soul walked naked to and fro, knowing the unknowable, and conscious strangely of experience, intimate but inexpressible, of the absolute. And without surprise, in that blue sky, real with a reality that not the eye but the soul confesses, with its rack of light clouds driven by strange breezes, like the cries and the sighs of lost souls, you saw the Blessed Virgin with a gown of red and a cloak of blue, surrounded by winged angels. Philip felt that the inhabitants of that city would have seen the apparition without astonishment, reverent and thankful, and have gone their ways.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="菲利普还是一言不发，又看了看那张托莱多的风景画。他觉得这是所有画里最吸引人的一幅。他的眼睛都移不开了，只莫名觉得自己竟像是站在一道门槛上，离生命的新发现只有一步之遥。这种冒险的快感让他激动不已，不由想起那曾令他牵肠挂肚的爱情。与他现在体会到的兴奋相比，爱情似乎微不足道。这幅画很长，画面里一座山，山顶盖满了房子，一角是个拿着地图的男孩，另一角则是典型的塔霍河轮廓，天空上是天使簇拥的圣母。这幅画让菲利普感到陌生诡异，他生活在一个崇拜绝对现实的环境之中，可这幅画里的情景却让他觉得比之前追崇模仿的大师笔下的作品更加真实。阿西尔尼说这幅画描绘得如此精确，以至于托莱多的市民都能从画里找到自己的房子。画家把自己看到的事物一五一十地描画出来，可他不是用肉眼所见，而是用精神。这座灰白的城镇里有些超自然的神秘因素。一束既非黑夜也非白昼的光照亮了这座荒芜暗淡的灵魂之城。它坐落在绿色的山岗上，可那般绿色却并不属于这个世界。四周是坚实的城墙和巨大的堡垒，人类发明的所有武器都不能摧毁它，唯有被祈祷、斋戒、悔叹和苦修的力量攻破。这里是上帝之心。用来搭建这些灰色房子的石料连泥瓦匠都没有见过。样子阴森森，不知道什么人会住在里面。若是走过这里的街道，便会惊讶地发现这些房子虽已废弃，却空而不寂。这里有一种无形的存在，虽然看不见，却能被清晰地感知。这是一座神秘之城，便是纵情想象也无法名状，像从光亮忽然步入黑暗，赤裸的灵魂信步徘徊，似冥冥又似昭昭。这绝对的体验，只可感知意会，无法用语言加以表述。果不其然，蓝色的天空中是身着红袍蓝篷的圣母，身旁一群挥动翅膀的天使环绕。笔触中透出的真实仿佛是灵魂的忏悔，这是肉眼所不能见。阵阵怪风吹拂几缕轻云，仿佛是迷失的灵魂在呼喊、叹息。就菲利普看来，他们即便见到鬼怪，也只会怀着虔诚与感恩各自上路。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Athelny spoke of the mystical writers of Spain, of Teresa de Avila, San Juan de la Cruz, Fray Luis de Leon; in all of them was that passion for the unseen which Philip felt in the pictures of El Greco: they seemed to have the power to touch the incorporeal and see the invisible. They were Spaniards of their age, in whom were tremulous all the mighty exploits of a great nation: their fancies were rich with the glories of America and the green islands of the Caribbean Sea; in their veins was the power that had come from age-long battling with the Moor; they were proud, for they were masters of the world; and they felt in themselves the wide distances, the tawny wastes, the snow-capped mountains of Castile, the sunshine and the blue sky, and the flowering plains of Andalusia. Life was passionate and manifold, and because it offered so much they felt a restless yearning for something more; because they were human they were unsatisfied; and they threw this eager vitality of theirs into a vehement striving after the ineffable. Athelny was not displeased to find someone to whom he could read the translations with which for some time he had amused his leisure; and in his fine, vibrating voice he recited the canticle of the Soul and Christ her lover, the lovely poem which begins with the words en una noche oscura, and the noche serena of Fray Luis de Leon. He had translated them quite simply, not without skill, and he had found words which at all events suggested the rough-hewn grandeur of the original. The pictures of El Greco explained them, and they explained the pictures.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿西尔尼讲起西班牙的神秘主义作家：阿维拉的大德兰修女、圣胡安·德拉·科鲁兹和路易斯·德·莱昂。这些人的作品里都有着对不可见事物的热忱，就像菲利普从埃尔·格列柯的画中感受到的一样。他们似乎有着能够触及无形的能力。他们是生活在那个年代的西班牙人，见证了伟大祖国的丰功伟绩；他们的奇思遐想中闪耀着美洲大陆的光辉和加勒比海小岛上的盈盈绿意；他们的血管里流淌着与非洲摩尔人长期战斗的勇敢力量；他们的身体内仿佛能感受到卡斯提尔广袤的疆土、茶褐色的荒芜地表和大雪封顶的山头，能感受到安达卢西亚金灿灿的阳光、蓝澄澄的天空和鲜花盛放的平原。他们是世界的主人，他们以自己为骄傲。生命充满激情，灿烂丰富，它给人带来了许多，也叫人有了不尽的欲望，试图追求更多。人类的特性就是不知满足，他们把孜孜不倦的活力化作对某种无可言喻的实体的追求。阿西尔尼闲暇时爱翻译些西班牙诗歌，现在找到了能一起诵读品赏的对象，不能说是不愉快的。他用动听、颤动的嗓音朗读着颂歌《灵魂与基督之爱》和路易斯·德·莱昂的以“一个昏黑的夜”或“静谧夜中”为开头的优美诗歌。他翻译起这些诗来并不费劲，也用不着什么技巧。他早就知道怎样的辞藻能在任何情形下形容出原语里粗糙而壮丽的含义。埃尔·格列柯的画阐释了这些诗歌，而诗歌又反过来给画作做下注解。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Philip had cultivated a certain disdain for idealism. He had always had a passion for life, and the idealism he had come across seemed to him for the most part a cowardly shrinking from it. The idealist withdrew himself, because he could not suffer the jostling of the human crowd; he had not the strength to fight and so called the battle vulgar; he was vain, and since his fellows would not take him at his own estimate, consoled himself with despising his fellows. For Philip his type was Hayward, fair, languid, too fat now and rather bald, still cherishing the remains of his good looks and still delicately proposing to do exquisite things in the uncertain future; and at the back of this were whiskey and vulgar amours of the street. It was in reaction from what Hayward represented that Philip clamoured for life as it stood; sordidness, vice, deformity, did not offend him; he declared that he wanted man in his nakedness; and he rubbed his hands when an instance came before him of meanness, cruelty, selfishness, or lust: that was the real thing. In Paris he had learned that there was neither ugliness nor beauty, but only truth: the search after beauty was sentimental. Had he not painted an advertisement of chocolat Menier in a landscape in order to escape from the tyranny of prettiness?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如今的菲利普以一种不屑的眼光看待理想主义。他一直以来都对生活充满激情，而他接触到的大部分理想主义却只是教人胆怯地逃避生活。理想主义者无法忍受人世间的冲撞骚动，所以总是离群索居。他没有力量奋起反抗，只能将这种反抗诋毁为恶俗。每当同伴对他的评价与他的自我评价不符，就诋毁蔑视他们来聊以自慰。在菲利普看来，理想主义者的典型代表就是像海沃德那样的人，曾经衣冠楚楚、性格散漫，现在又肥又秃，可对自己相貌仅存的亮眼处非常在意，还时不时地精心计划，试图在未知的将来成就大业。可他生活的另一面却是终日的饮酒狂欢、拈花惹草。正是因为看到了海沃德的这番境地，菲利普才决意振臂高呼，坚持要让生活维持其原本的样子。肮脏、罪恶、缺陷，统统只是过眼云烟；他想看到最真实、赤裸的人。每当遇到卑鄙残暴、自私贪欲的行为，他都兴奋地不停搓手：唯有这些才是真实啊！他在巴黎学到，世上本无美丑，有的只是真相。对美的追求不过是感情用事罢了。当初他为了不陷入“美”之桎梏，不也学着在风景画前头添了个巧克力的广告牌吗？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But here he seemed to divine something new. He had been coming to it, all hesitating, for some time, but only now was conscious of the fact; he felt himself on the brink of a discovery. He felt vaguely that here was something better than the realism which he had adored; but certainly it was not the bloodless idealism which stepped aside from life in weakness; it was too strong; it was virile; it accepted life in all its vivacity, ugliness and beauty, squalor and heroism; it was realism still; but it was realism carried to some higher pitch, in which facts were transformed by the more vivid light in which they were seen. He seemed to see things more profoundly through the grave eyes of those dead noblemen of Castile; and the gestures of the saints, which at first had seemed wild and distorted, appeared to have some mysterious significance. But he could not tell what that significance was. It was like a message which it was very important for him to receive, but it was given him in an unknown tongue, and he could not understand. He was always seeking for a meaning in life, and here it seemed to him that a meaning was offered; but it was obscure and vague. He was profoundly troubled. He saw what looked like the truth as by flashes of lightning on a dark, stormy night you might see a mountain range. He seemed to see that a man need not leave his life to chance, but that his will was powerful; he seemed to see that self-control might be as passionate and as active as the surrender to passion; he seemed to see that the inward life might be as manifold, as varied, as rich with experience, as the life of one who conquered realms and explored unknown lands.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在，他似乎又觉察到些新的东西。长久以来，他对自己的感觉都犹豫不决，一直到现在才终于确定这一事实，原来自己与新的发现仅有一步之隔。他模糊觉得似乎有比自己一直崇拜的现实主义更好的思想，而且那显然不是只能让人消极避世的、软弱而苍白的理想主义。它强劲有力，充满气魄；它能坦然接受生命中的活力与懈怠，丑陋与美丽，懦弱与勇敢。它其实还是一种现实主义，只是被推到了更高的层度；事实在这里得以大见天日，暴露于一道耀眼的明光之下。他透过已逝的卡斯提尔贵族们的眼睛看到了万事万物更深层的内涵。圣徒摆出的姿势打眼看去非常古怪扭曲，可深藏其中的含义现在却慢慢显露。只是他也参不透这些含义究竟该作何讲。像是一封向他发来的急函，打开后却发现纸上尽是看不懂的文字。生命的意义究竟为何？他一直在寻寻觅觅，答案仿佛早已找到，只是晦涩难懂，不可解读。他的内心深深迷惑着。真相总是稍纵即逝，就像在漆黑的暴雨夜中，倏忽打亮的闪电让你看清一眼山的轮廓。他似乎认识到，人不能拿生活碰运气，自身的意志非常强大。他似乎认识到自我控制是一种同屈服于激情一样热烈积极的行为；他似乎认识到和那些征服疆土、发现大陆的人的生活相比，内在的精神生活也一样多种多样、体验丰富。">查看中文翻译</div>
