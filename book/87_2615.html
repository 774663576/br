<div class="line_en">It was a study in weirdness. The hall wasn't all that spectacular, the carpet runner and the wallpaper done in basic tans and browns, the wide windows showing only the darkness outside. The display chests that lined the inner wall, though… There were three of them, each topped by a small lamp, and each prominently displaying a wide array of bleached human bones on open shelves, inter-spersed with small items of obscurity. Jill started down the hall, stopping briefly at each bizarre specta-cle. Skulls, arm and leg bones, hands and feet. There were at least three complete skeletons, and amidst the pale and pitted bones were feathers, clay beads, gnarled strips of leather.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sure enough. She took another long look at the pocket computer's screen and then slipped it into her pack, thinking. It looked like there was a back way out, through several halls and past a series of rooms. She could look for Wesker and the others along the way, and maybe secure an escape route at the same time. She stepped into the narrow corridor, the fully loaded Beretta in hand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="正如她所想，吉尔盯着微型电脑的屏幕，一边在心里想着一边将工具放回腰包。从屏幕中的地图上能够看到，在连续穿过几条走廊、经过一连串的屋子后，有一个能够通向外界的后面。穿过这条走廊，也许会遇到威斯克和其他的队友，而且她认为这是一条安全的路线。吉尔迈步走进这条狭窄的回廊，手里紧紧握着装满弹药的贝雷塔。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jill picked up one of the leather strips and then put it down quickly, wiping her fingers on her pants. She couldn't be sure, but it felt like she imagined tanned, cured human skin would feel, stiff and kind of greasy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔将那些细长皮中的一块拿在手中，随即又放回了原处，急忙把手在裤子上蹭了蹭。虽然不能断言，但是那些皮应该是经过保存处理的人类的皮肤。手感有些粗糙，但是能感受到上面应该是涂了一些润滑剂之类的东西…">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The window behind her exploded inward, a lithe, sinewy form lunging into the hall, growling and snapping. It was one of the mutant, killing hounds, its eyes as red as its dripping hide. It charged her, its teeth as bright and dangerous as the jagged glitter of glass still falling from the shattered frame.</div>

<div class="line_en">She brushed her bangs out of her eyes and crouched down next to it, taking in the strange, exposed muscu-lature and huge jaws. It had been too dark and hectic on the run to the house to get a good look at the things that had killed Joseph, but in the bright light of the corridor, her initial impression wasn't changed; it looked like a skinned dog.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她拢了一下垂在前额的头发，在这条浑身暴露出奇怪的肌肉组织，有着巨大下颚的怪物狗旁边蹲了下来。之前在森林中时天色已晚，后来又拼命的向着别墅逃窜，所以一直没有机会好好看一下这种杀害了约瑟夫的怪物。不过在回廊中的灯光下，吉尔一开始对这种东西所产生的印象并没有得到改变。这头怪物的确就像是一条被剥了皮的狗。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The door at the end of the long hall was unlocked. It opened into another hall, not as well lit as the first but at least not as creepy, either. The muted, gray-green wallpaper sported paintings of generic scenery and gentle landscapes, not a bone or fetish in sight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在长长的走廊尽头有一扇门，很幸运的是并没有锁。打开后，一条新的走廊继续向前延伸。虽然没有刚才那条走廊明亮，但至少没有那种可怕的气氛。在贴着灰绿色壁纸的墙上挂着几幅普通的风景画，并没有骨头或者是其他奇怪的东西。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Right, just like it was unlikely that Chris would disappear; don't assume anything about this place.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，说起克里斯的消失也的确是有些奇怪，这间别墅里果然没有什么事情是可以确定的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The next door she tried opened into a small bathroom with an antique feel, complete with a ceiling fan and an old-fashioned, four-footed tub. There was no sign of recent use.</div>

<div class="line_en">The first door on the right was locked, a carving of armor on the key plate. Jill remembered the list on the computer, something about knight keys, but decided not to bother with it for now. According to Trent's map, there was a room on the other side that didn't lead anywhere. Besides, if Wesker had come this way, she didn't imagine that he was locking doors behind him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="右手边第一道门被锁上了，在钥匙孔板上刻有铠甲的印记。吉尔忽然想起在微型电脑的那张清单上好像提到关于骑士的钥匙，但现在她并没有为那些事而感到伤脑筋。根据特兰特所提供的地图，这扇门的另一侧只是一个无法通到其他地方的房间而已。而且她也并不认为威斯克能够不用钥匙就进到这扇门里面去…">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She stood for a moment in the stale, tiny room, breathing deeply, feeling the aftermath of the adrenaline rush she'd had in the corridor. Growing up, she'd learned how to enjoy the thrill of danger, of sneaking in and out of strange places with only a handful of tools and her own wits to keep her safe. Since joining the S. T. A. R. S., that youthful excitement had faded away, lost to the realities of back-up and handguns, but here it was again, unexpected and not unwelcome. She couldn't lie to herself about the simple joy that often followed facing death and walking away. She felt… good. Alive.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔站在这个小房间里，深吸了一口气，此刻她还能感受到刚才在走廊里飞奔时身体中所分泌出来的肾上腺素的余波。在危险的刺激下，只有很少的道具来保证自身的安全，利用智慧在陌生的地方潜行，对于这一系列的突发事件吉尔竟然体验到了一种莫名的乐趣。自从加入S.T。A.R。S之后，作为年轻人的兴奋逐渐减少，继而这种感觉在满是手枪和装备的现实中消失不见。但是不可预期的意外另这些感觉此时在吉尔的内心中重新苏醒过来。吉尔屡次直接面对死亡，但必须承认的是每次化险为夷时她都会感到一种单纯的快乐。（这就是M…囧）她感觉…很美妙，自己还活着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The corridor ended with two doors facing each other. The one on the right was the one she wanted. She tried the handle and was rewarded with the soft snick of the bolt retracting.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在前方不远处，有两扇门分别处于走廊的左右两侧。吉尔想要打开右侧的那扇门，试着转动了一下门把手，门锁发出了“喀嚓”声后，门应声而开。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She stepped into a dark hall and saw one of the zombies, a hulking, pale shadow standing next to a door, maybe ten feet away. As she raised her weapon, the creature started toward her, emitting soft hunger sounds from its decaying lips. One of its arms hung limply at its side, and although Jill could see jagged bone protruding from the shoulder, it still clenched and unclenched its rotting fist eagerly as it reached out with its other arm.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔走进一条昏暗的走廊，在几十米远的一扇门旁，一个动作迟缓的苍白人影进入了她的视线。是丧尸，吉尔紧握手枪，丧尸慢慢地向她走来。从满是腐肉的嘴唇里发出了饥渴的声音，丧尸的一只手无力地垂下来，另一只则向前伸出，好像想要抓住什么东西似的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jill stepped back into the silent hallway and edged around another corner, wondering if Barry had found Chris and if either of them had run across any of the Bravos. She felt like she had an advantage with the maps, and decided that once she'd checked out the possible escape, she'd go back to the main hall and wait for Barry. With the information on Trent's computer, they could search more quickly and thoroughly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔的注意力重新回到被寂静所支配的走廊中，转过一个拐角随即又在心里思索，巴瑞找到克里斯了吧，或者他们两个中的某个人大概会遇到Bravo小队的人吧。吉尔感觉由于自己的手中拿着地图，所以处于有力的立场。她决定如果能够找到逃离这里的地方，马上就返回正门大厅等待巴瑞。只要有电脑里的这份情报，两个人能够更快地将所有地方搜索一遍。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The shots were incredibly loud in the chilly gloom, the first blowing off its left ear, the second and third punching holes into its skull just above its pallid brow. Dark fluids streamed down the peeling face and it fell to its knees, its flat, lifeless eyes rolling back into its head.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="枪声在可怕的黑暗中发出了巨大的声音，第一颗子弹将怪物的左耳打烂，第二颗与第三颗在那家伙苍白的脸上开了两个洞。可怕的黑色液体从伤口里流出来，继而流过它的脸庞。丧尸直挺挺地倒在地上，毫无生气的眼睛向后翻着白眼。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She stepped out onto a covered walkway, a mosaic of green stone surrounded by high concrete walls. There were small intermittent openings near the ceiling of the pathway, accounting for the faint, pine-scented breeze. Ivy trickled down from the arched openings like a reminder of the outside world. She hurried down the dim passage, remembering from the map that there was a single room at the end and to the right, probably a storage shed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔踏上一条由绿色马赛克铺成的小路，四周围有混凝土墙，在靠近天棚的附近每隔一段距离就设置有很小的通风口，带着松树气味的风就是从那里吹进来的。在这些拱形的通风口部位都垂有常春藤，令人很容易联想到外面的世界。吉尔一边走着，一边想起了那张地图。在这条路的尽头有一个房间，在右手边，好像有个仓库…">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She turned the corner and stopped at another heavy-looking metal door, her smile fading as she reflexively reached for the handle; the keyhole was plugged. She crouched and poked at the tiny hole, but to no avail. Someone had stopped it up with epoxy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔转过拐角，站在了一扇看上去很厚重的金属门前。正当她反射性地将手伸向门把手时，她脸上的笑容突然消失了。锁孔被某种填充物堵上了，虽然还能够看到小小的锁孔，不过这根本没有任何意义，里面灌注的应该是环氧基树脂之类的东西。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It creaked open and fresh air flooded past her, warm and clean after the morgue-like chill of the house. Jill grinned, hearing the drone of cicadas and crickets on the night air. She'd reached the final leg of her little excursion, and although she wasn't outside yet, the sounds and smells of the forest renewed her sense of accomplishment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔将门推开，铁门发出了吱吱嘎嘎的声音，一股新鲜的空气向着吉尔吹来。夜色中，蟋蟀与一些不知明昆虫的单调叫声此起彼伏。吉尔笑了笑，终于迈出了离开地狱的最后一步。虽然现在还没有完全离开这里，但是森林中的空气以及声音给了她足够的成就感。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A lone howl rose in the distance and was joined by the echoing cries of the dogs near the mansion, the strange, yodeling sounds piercing the gentle quiet of the woods. There had to be dozens of them out there, and Jill realized suddenly that escaping out the back door probably wasn't such a hot idea.
