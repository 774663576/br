<div class="line_en">It was not until long afterward that she realized that her bed had been so hard that she turned over and over in it to find a place to rest, that the darkness seemed more intense than any she had ever known, and that the wind howled over the roof among the chimneys like something which wailed aloud. Then there was something worse. This was certain scufflings and scratchings and squeakings in the walls and behind the skirting boards. She knew what they meant, because Becky had described them. They meant rats and mice who were either fighting with each other or playing together. Once or twice she even heard sharp-toed feet scurrying across the floor, and she remembered in those after days, when she recalled things, that when first she heard them she started up in bed and sat trembling, and when she lay down again covered her head with the bedclothes.</div>

<div class="line_en">The first night she spent in her attic was a thing Sara never forgot. During its passing she lived through a wild, unchildlike woe of which she never spoke to anyone about her. There was no one who would have understood. It was, indeed, well for her that as she lay awake in the darkness her mind was forcibly distracted, now and then, by the strangeness of her surroundings. It was, perhaps, well for her that she was reminded by her small body of material things. If this had not been so, the anguish of her young mind might have been too great for a child to bear. But, really, while the night was passing she scarcely knew that she had a body at all or remembered any other thing than one.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mariette had left the house the next morning. The glimpse Sara caught of her sitting room, as she passed its open door, showed her that everything had been changed. Her ornaments and luxuries had been removed, and a bed had been placed in a corner to transform it into a new pupil's bedroom.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="马里耶特第二天早晨就走了。萨拉经过自己的起坐间时，门敞开着，她向室内瞥了一眼，发现一切都改变了。她的那些装饰品和豪华的衣物都被拿走了，室内一角安了一张床，这房间已经变成一个新学生的卧室了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That was the beginning, and from day to day the duties given to her were added to. She taught the younger children French and heard their other lessons, and these were the least of her labors. It was found that she could be made use of in numberless directions. She could be sent on errands at any time and in all weathers. She could be told to do things other people neglected. The cook and the housemaids took their tone from Miss Minchin, and rather enjoyed ordering about the "young one" who had been made so much fuss over for so long. They were not servants of the best class, and had neither good manners nor good tempers, and it was frequently convenient to have at hand someone on whom blame could be laid.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是个开头，从此给她的职责一天天增加。她教幼小儿童法语，辅导她们的其他功课，这些还是她至少要做的事儿。铭钦女士发现在很多方面可以使用她。不论什么时候，什么样的天气，都可以打发她去跑腿千杂务。可以叫她去做其他人由于疏忽而没有做的事儿。厨子和女仆们都学铭钦女士的腔调，很喜欢支使这个曾长期被大肆奉承的“小家伙”。她们不是那类最上等的仆人，既不懂礼貌，也没有好脾气，再说，如果出了错儿，可以经常把责任推卸给手边的什么人，那才方便呢。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">During the first month or two, Sara thought that her willingness to do things as well as she could, and her silence under reproof, might soften those who drove her so hard. In her proud little heart she wanted them to see that she was trying to earn her living and not accepting charity. But the time came when she saw that no one was softened at all; and the more willing she was to do as she was told, the more domineering and exacting careless housemaids became, and the more ready a scolding cook was to blame her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="头一两个月中，萨拉心想，自己这样愿意尽力把事情做好，受到责备也不吭声，大概可以软化那些狠狠驱使她的人吧。在她高傲的幼小心灵中，她立意要让他们明白她是在努力挣饭吃，而不是靠别人的施舍。但终于有一天她明白了，根本一个人也软化不了；她越是诚心诚意做好吩咐她做的事情，那些粗鲁的女仆就变得越盛气凌人，要求也越苛刻，而爱骂人的厨子就越随便地责备她。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">If she had been older, Miss Minchin would have given her the bigger girls to teach and saved money by dismissing an instructress; but while she remained and looked like a child, she could be made more useful as a sort of little superior errand girl and maid of all work. An ordinary errand boy would not have been so clever and reliable. Sara could be trusted with difficult commissions and complicated messages. She could even go and pay bills, and she combined with this the ability to dust a room well and to set things in order.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果她年龄大一些，铭钦女士早就会让她给大一点儿的姑娘教课了，这样便可以辞退一位女教师以节省开支；但既然她依然是并且看上去也像个小孩子，把地当做一种干杂务的高级小丫头和做各种工作的女仆就能使她更为有用了。一个普通干杂活的男僮不会像她那样聪明可靠。让萨拉去完成困难的任务和传递复杂的口信是可以信赖的。她甚至能出去按账单付款，另外还能打扫房间，整理家什。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Her own lessons became things of the past. She was taught nothing, and only after long and busy days spent in running here and there at everybody's orders was she grudgingly allowed to go into the deserted schoolroom, with a pile of old books, and study alone at night.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她自己的学业已成为过去的事了。现在什么都不让她学，每天被大家呼来唤去，弄得东奔西跑，只是在这样忙碌了一整天后才勉强允许她进入空旷无人的教室，带着一摞旧书，独自在夜间用功。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"If I do not remind myself of the things I have learned, perhaps I may forget them," she said to herself.

<div class="line_en">One of the most curious things in her new existence was her changed position among the pupils. Instead of being a sort of small royal personage among them, she no longer seemed to be one of their number at all. She was kept so constantly at work that she scarcely ever had an opportunity of speaking to any of them, and she could not avoid seeing that Miss Minchin preferred that she should live a life apart from that of the occupants of the schoolroom.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在她的新生活中，有一桩极稀奇的事情：她在学生中的地位改变了。她不再是她们中间的那种小贵族人物，甚至似乎根本不再是她们中的一员了。她被人支使，没完没了地工作，几乎没有机会和她们中的任何人说话，而且她不得不看出，铭钦女士宁愿让她过一种与教室的占据者们相隔离的生活。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I will not have her forming intimacies and talking to the other children," that lady said. "Girls like a grievance, and if she begins to tell romantic stories about herself, she will become an ill-used heroine, and parents will be given a wrong impression. It is better that she should live a separate life -- one suited to her circumstances. I am giving her a home, and that is more than she has any right to expect from me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我绝不让她与别的孩子形成亲密关系，也不让她同她们谈话，”这位女士说。“女孩子们爱发牢骚，如果她开始讲关于她自己的荒诞故事，她会成为其中受虐待的女主人公，这会给学生的家长们一个错误的印象。所以最好让她过隔离的生活——一种适合于她的处境的生活。我给了她一个家，这已经超过了她有权指望从我这里得到的东西。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sara did not expect much, and was far too proud to try to continue to be intimate with girls who evidently felt rather awkward and uncertain about her. The fact was that Miss Minchin's pupils were a set of dull, matter-of-fact young people. They were accustomed to being rich and comfortable, and as Sara's frocks grew shorter and shabbier and queerer-looking, and it became an established fact that she wore shoes with holes in them and was sent out to buy groceries and carry them through the streets in a basket on her arm when the cook wanted them in a hurry, they felt rather as if, when they spoke to her, they were addressing an under servant.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="萨拉并不指望得到很多，她很自傲，也不屑继续努力去亲近那些态度上明显对她感到有点为难和游移不定的女孩子。铭钦女士的学生事实上是一群愚钝平凡的小姑娘。她们习惯于富裕和舒适的生活，而萨拉身上的衣服却显得越来越短，越来越破，变得怪模怪样的。她穿着有破洞的鞋子，臂上挎着篮子被打发到街上去买厨子急需的伙食，这已成为既成事实，于是那群学生对萨拉说话时就觉得像是在对低下的奴仆讲话似的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But before daybreak she used to slip into Sara's attic and button her dress and give her such help as she required before she went downstairs to light the kitchen fire. And when night came Sara always heard the humble knock at her door which meant that her handmaid was ready to help her again if she was needed. During the first weeks of her grief Sara felt as if she were too stupefied to talk, so it happened that some time passed before they saw each other much or exchanged visits. Becky's heart told her that it was best that people in trouble should be left alone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但在破晓以前，她常常溜进萨拉的阁楼，帮她扣衣服扣子，或者在下楼去厨房生火前做点儿萨拉需要她帮忙的事儿。每当夜幕降临时，萨拉总会听到她房门上的那种恭顺的敲门声，这意味着如果她需要的话，她这贴身侍女准备再来帮助她。头几个星期，哀伤的萨拉感到神经麻木得似乎无法谈话，所以过了一段时间她们彼此才常见面，或者互相探望。贝基的心告诉自己，人们在苦恼中时最好让他们单独自处，不要去打扰。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The first, it must be owned, was Becky -- just Becky. Throughout all that first night spent in the garret, she had felt a vague comfort in knowing that on the other side of the wall in which the rats scuffled and squeaked there was another young human creature. And during the nights that followed the sense of comfort grew. They had little chance to speak to each other during the day. Each had her own tasks to perform, and any attempt at conversation would have been regarded as a tendency to loiter and lose time. "Don't mind me, miss," Becky whispered during the first morning, "if I don't say nothin' polite. Some un'd be down on us if I did. I MEANS `please' an' `thank you' an' `beg pardon,' but I dassn't to take time to say it."</div>

When she came back she did not see Sara for a day or two, and when she met her for the first time she encountered her coming down a corridor with her arms full of garments which were to be taken downstairs to be mended. Sara herself had already been taught to mend them. She looked pale and unlike herself, and she was attired in the queer, outgrown frock whose shortness showed so much thin black leg.</div>

The two had always been friends, but Sara had felt as if she were years the older. It could not be contested that Ermengarde was as dull as she was affectionate. She clung to Sara in a simple, helpless way; she brought her lessons to her that she might be helped; she listened to her every word and besieged her with requests for stories.

<div class="line_en">Then Sara was guilty of an injustice. Just at that moment her torn heart swelled within her, and she felt that if anyone was as stupid as that, one had better get away from her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时萨拉感到受到了不公正的对待。就在这个关头，她那颗被撕碎的心充满了怒火，她觉得如果有人这样头脑糊涂，那还是走开的好。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In course of time she realized that if her wretchedness had not made her forget things, she would have known that poor, dull Ermengarde was not to be blamed for her unready, awkward ways. She was always awkward, and the more she felt, the more stupid she was given to being.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="随着时间的推移，她认识到倘若不是悲惨的遭遇使她忘前忘后，她会知道这个可怜、愚钝的埃芒加德是不应因为不机灵和笨口拙舌而受责怪的。埃芒加德总是那么笨拙，她愈是意识到这一点，就越发变得愚蠢。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So for several weeks a barrier stood between them. When they met by chance Sara looked the other way, and Ermengarde felt too stiff and embarrassed to speak. Sometimes they nodded to each other in passing, but there were times when they did not even exchange a greeting.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是一连几个星期，她俩之间竖着一座屏障。她们偶然相遇时，萨拉眼睛望着別处，而埃芒加德感到局促窘迫，说不出话来。有时候她俩互相点点头就走过去了，也有些时候甚至彼此不打招呼。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"What are you crying for, Ermengarde?" she asked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你哭什么，埃芒加德？”她问道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Miss Minchin made it so easy that at last they scarcely saw each other at all. At that time it was noticed that Ermengarde was more stupid than ever, and that she looked listless and unhappy. She used to sit in the window-seat, huddled in a heap, and stare out of the window without speaking. Once Jessie, who was passing, stopped to look at her curiously.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="铭钦女士的办法确实很灵，她俩终于几乎不见面了。那时候，人们注意到埃芒加德比以前更蠢了，显得无精打采、郁郁不欢。她经常坐在窗座上，蜷缩成一团，默默地望着窗外。有一回，杰西经过那里，站住了好奇地看着她。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm not crying," answered Ermengarde, in a muffled, unsteady voice.</div>

<div class="line_en">That night, when Sara went to her attic, she was later than usual. She had been kept at work until after the hour at which the pupils went to bed, and after that she had gone to her lessons in the lonely schoolroom. When she reached the top of the stairs, she was surprised to see a glimmer of light coming from under the attic door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天夜里，萨拉回阁楼比往常晚。人们一直在让她干活儿，等到学生们都上床去睡之后，她才去那空无一人的教室学习功课。当她上楼走到楼梯口时，惊奇地发现阁楼门底下露出一片微光。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You are," said Jessie. "A great big tear just rolled down the bridge of your nose and dropped off at the end of it. And there goes another."</div>

<div class="line_en">Someone had, indeed, lighted a candle, and it was not burning in the kitchen candlestick she was expected to use, but in one of those belonging to the pupils' bedrooms. The someone was sitting upon the battered footstool, and was dressed in her nightgown and wrapped up in a red shawl. It was Ermengarde.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="的确有人点燃了一支蜡烛，它不是插在她被允许使用的厨房里的烛台上，而是插在学生卧室里的一个烛台上。那人正坐在那只破旧的脚凳上，穿着睡袍，裹着红披肩。那是埃芒加德。">查看中文翻译</div>
