<div class="line_en">The bed was unfamiliar and narrow, the mattress lumpy. The ceiling above her was raftered with solid pieces of timber that looked like they had stood strong for a hundred years. She blinked twice, trying to get her bearings.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Good morning." The soft voice came from her left and made her snap her head sharply towards it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“早上好。”从左边传来一声温柔的问候，她朝声音的方向猛地转头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The first light of the morning sent the sun's rays streaming through the windows of the cabin, and even filtered by the dust and grime on the panes it was strong enough to wake Dylan. She stirred feebly, brushing her hair from her face and rubbing her eyes. For a moment she wasn't sure where she was, and she lay still, taking stock of her surroundings.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="清晨第一缕阳光透过小屋的窗子涌进来。虽然经过了窗格上灰尘和污垢的过滤，但光线依然很强，足够把迪伦唤醒。她虚弱无力地醒过来，把脸上的头发轻轻拂到一边，揉了揉眼睛。一瞬间她竟不知身在何处。她静静地躺着，打量着周围的一切。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"How d'you sleep?" Tristan's normal, polite question seemed somehow out of place; decorum in the midst of madness. She couldn't help but grin.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“睡得还好吗？”崔斯坦一句正常的礼貌问候听起来却和这里的环境有些格格不入，恶鬼屯于阶前犹不失礼貌。她忍不住笑了起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Morning," she replied softly, a blush warming her cheeks. Although they had shared much last night, Dylan felt awkward again, unsure of herself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“早上好。”她柔声回答，脸上泛过一片红晕。尽管两人昨晚大部分时间都待在一起，但迪伦还是感到尴尬，紧张不安。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Ow!" The quick movement pinched a nerve in her neck. As her hand rubbed the cramping pain away, Dylan stared in the direction of the voice, comprehension dawning.</div>

<div class="line_en">He smiled. "I don't need to. One of the oddities of the wasteland. You don't really, either. Your mind just thinks it should, so it does. Eventually it will forget. Takes a while to adjust."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他笑了，“我不需要睡觉，这是荒原上的一大怪事。其实你也不需要睡觉的，你只是心里面觉得这有必要，于是就非睡不可。最后你会忘掉睡眠的，要花一点时间慢慢适应。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Okay, you?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“还不错，你呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She stared at him, speechless for a moment. "No sleep?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她盯着她，一时无语。过了一会儿她才说：“不睡觉？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Huh," was all she could manage. She looked towards the window. "Is it safe to go outside?" She wasn't sure if the monsters -- demons -- from last night were still a threat during the day.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她的心中千言万语，最后却只是嘿了一声。她向窗外望去，“现在出去安全吗？”她不清楚昨晚上那些怪兽—恶魔是不是在白天也会造成威胁。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dylan's mouth opened and closed a few times. This sounded like some bizarre science-fiction movie. Had she landed in the Matrix? All these things Tristan was telling her, they seemed incredible, unbelievable, but as she stared down at her hands she realised that, even though they were encrusted with mud, they were smooth, unblemished. The deep scratches left by the wraiths had healed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦惊得嘴开开合合了几次。这话听起来就像奇奇怪怪的科幻电影。难道她已经身处矩阵？崔斯坦告诉她的所有事情都似乎荒诞不经、难以置信。但当她俯视自己的双手时，她才发现尽管上面全是厚厚的淤泥，但这双手却光滑无瑕，魔鬼留在自己手上的深深抓痕已经不治自愈了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He shook his head. "No sleeping, no eating, no drinking. Your body is just your mind's projection. You left the real thing back on the train."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他摇摇头，“不睡觉，不吃饭，不喝水。你的身体只是你心像的投射，你的真实躯壳留在车上了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yeah, they're not too keen on the sunlight. Of course, if it was a cloudy, dark day, they might surface, if they were desperate enough." Tristan looked at her frightened expression. "We should be okay today, though. Nice sunshine." He gestured towards the window.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“现在安全。它们在阳光下就不活跃。当然，如果天色多云而阴沉，它们足够拼命的话也可能会出现。”崔斯坦看看她害怕的表情，“不过今天我们应该会安然无恙的。大晴天。”他朝窗子指了指。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Did I die in the wasteland winter?" Dylan's eyes were slightly amused, but also intrigued. She wanted to know more about this strange place.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我已经死在荒原的冬天里了吗？”迪伦的眼神中有一丝调皮，但同时也带着好奇。她想知道更多关于这个奇怪地方的事情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tristan stared at her, deliberating over how much to tell her. Guides were supposed to deliver their souls across the wasteland and nothing else. Most, when they discovered where they really were and what had happened to them, were too absorbed in their own sorrow and self-pity to show much interest in this road between the real world and the end. Dylan was not like any other soul he'd ever encountered. She had accepted the truth calmly, with no outbursts. Now the eyes that examined him were simply questioning, curious. And a little more information might make it easier for her to accept and understand, he argued with himself, but in truth, he wanted to share it with her. He wanted a way to be closer to her. He took a deep breath and chose.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="崔斯坦看着她，心里掂量着话要说到几分。向导们的职责就是护送灵魂穿过荒原，仅此而已。大多数情况下，一旦那些灵魂发现自己现在不过是孤魂野鬼，自家已经身遭不测，他们就会沉浸在自己的痛苦中难以自拔，自伤自怜，对这趟跨越阴阳的旅程再提不起半分兴趣。迪伦和他之前见过的灵魂不一样，她已经平静地接受了现实，完全没有什么过激反应。现在那双探询的眼睛中只有疑问和好奇。他在心里劝自己，多给她一点信息可以让她更容易接受、理解现实。然而实际上，他是想把这一切跟她和盘托出，他是想找个办法跟她走得更近。他深吸一口气，做出了选择。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"We move. We still have a long way to go. The next safe house is ten miles away, and the darkness seems to come quickly here." He frowned out of the window, as if chastising the weather for placing them in danger.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“该走了。我们还有很长的路要走。下一个安全屋在离这儿十英里远的地方，这儿的天黑得似乎特别快。”他朝窗外皱了皱眉，似乎在责备这阴晴不定的天气让他们身处险境。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He had to bite his lip to stop himself from laughing. Her reaction was exactly as he had expected: perplexed and a little bit outraged. Her eyebrows furrowed and her lips pursed, her eyes narrowing to green slits.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他不得不咬着嘴唇好让自己不笑出声来。她的反应跟他预想的一样：一头雾水还有点生气。她眉头一皱嘴一噘，那双碧眼也眯了起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No." He smiled. "It's your fault."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的。”他笑着说，“这是你的错。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He chuckled. "What I mean is, the wasteland is what you make it." Her expression turned to one of startled confusion, as her eyes widened to sparkling pools in the sunlight. "Come on." He lifted himself from the chair, walked over to the door and opened it. "I'll explain on the way."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他恬然一笑，“我的意思是，这片荒原是你造成的。”她的表情变得既惊愕又困惑，双目圆睁，泪光闪闪，像阳光下波光粼粼的池塘，“走吧。”他从椅子上站起身，走到门边打开了门，“我在路上会给你解释的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"My fault? How is it my fault? I haven't done anything!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我的错？怎么是我的错呢？我什么也没做啊！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The air was warm as Dylan stepped outside, but a breeze crept around the walls of the cabin and tickled her hair, causing renegade strands to scurry across her face. The sun shone down, brightening the colours of the wasteland. Drops of dew caught the light and glinted in the wet grass, which looked a more luscious shade of green. The hills cut into the blue sky, their ridges razor sharp against the heavens. Everything appeared to be washed clean, and Dylan drew in a deep breath, revelling in the freshness of the morning. But dark clouds dotted the sky towards the horizon. She hoped the sun would banish them before they could steal the beautiful day.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦走出屋子，外面很暖和。一阵微风绕墙而过，轻拂她的头发，把几束不安分的头发吹到了她脸上。阳光普照，给荒原涂上了一抹亮色。湿漉漉的草叶上，露珠闪烁着微光。群山界破青天色，峻岭巍峨入云霄。万物净洁如洗，迪伦深吸一口气，在清新的早晨身心迷醉。然而地平线的方向上乌云星罗棋布。她希望太阳把乌云驱散，好让他们悄无声息地度过美好的一天。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dylan made a face. More marching. Understanding where they were going, and why it was so important to get there quickly, did not make the journey any more appealing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦做了一个鬼脸。更远的跋涉。她现在明白了他们要去往何地，为什么必须尽快赶到那儿，但这并没有让这趟旅程多一点吸引力。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Why can't the wasteland be a bit flatter?" she grumbled as she approached Tristan.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“为什么荒原不能稍微平坦一点呢？”她走到崔斯坦跟前，小声地抱怨。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Their journey began on the other side of the cabin, following a narrow, dirt trail that snaked across a meadow of long grass. There were wild flowers hidden amongst the pasture; drops of purple, yellow and red popping up in an ocean of green. The meadow was like an oasis, nestled in between the hills. It was roughly the size of a football pitch, but infinitely more beautiful. Dylan wanted to wander slowly, to drink in the scenery and trail her fingers in the foliage, letting the grass and flowers tickle her hand. For Tristan, however, it was simply another obstacle to overcome and he strode through without glancing left or right at the surrounding splendour. It took about ten minutes to cross, and Dylan soon found herself at the foot of the first hill of the day, staring up at it in consternation. Tristan had already started the ascent, and Dylan hurried to draw level.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们的这段旅程在小屋的一端开始，沿着一条狭窄的土路前行。小路蜿蜒曲折，穿过一片茂盛的草地。野花杂生其间，在一片绿色海洋中不时冒出星星点点的紫色、黄色和红色。这片草地如同山间半隐半现的绿洲，面积相当于一片足球场，但毫无疑问要比球场美丽得多。迪伦想缓步慢行，饱览美景，手指在草叶间拂过，任花草轻轻挠着手。而对于崔斯坦来说，这只是另一个要克服的障碍。他大步流星，对两边的美景看也不看一眼。他们花了十分钟穿过草地。迪伦很快发觉自己到了今天要翻越的第一座山脚下，不免惊慌失措地抬头仰视。而崔斯坦此时已经开始往山上走了，迪伦紧走几步跟上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She picked her way down the path after Tristan, trying to avoid the thistles and nettles that sneaked up between the cracked stones. Tristan waited just a few metres away, shifting from foot to foot in a way that told her he was eager to be off.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她跟在崔斯坦后面谨慎前行，尽量避开在碎石间潜滋暗长的蓟和荨麻。崔斯坦就在几步之外等着，身体重心不停地从一只脚换到另一只脚，潜台词是他急着赶路。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He smirked, but didn't reply. Instead he turned on his heel and began to lead the way. Dylan sighed and hitched up her jeans a little higher, hoping that it might stop them from getting quite so wet, quite so quickly, but knowing that it was a futile gesture.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他得意地笑笑，没有回答，而是脚跟一转，接着大踏步向前走。迪伦叹口气，把牛仔裤稍稍往上提，只盼这样裤子不至于湿透，但心里清楚，这样做完全于事无补。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It's also your fault that it's all uphill." Tristan chuckled darkly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“而且全都是上坡路，也是你的错。”说完，崔斯坦神秘兮兮地一笑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, that's just typical," Dylan muttered, already out of breath and cross at Tristan's enigmatic answers. Instead of being abashed, he laughed. The scowl on her face deepened.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好吧，山不都是这个样子。”迪伦喘着粗气嘟囔了一句，同时对崔斯坦神秘莫测的回答很生气。崔斯坦没有一点羞愧的意思，反而笑起来，脸上露出了几条笑纹。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"So," Dylan began as soon as she had caught up with his long, purposeful strides. "Why is all this…" She gestured to the barren landscape. "… my fault?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他每一步的步幅都很大，步履坚定。迪伦刚一赶上他，马上就打开了话匣子，“所以，为什么这些……”她指了指荒凉的群山，“都是我的错？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I said before that your body was your mind's projection. The wasteland is sort of the same thing." He paused to grab her elbow as she stumbled. She was too focused on what he was saying to watch her feet. "When you came out of the tunnel, you expected to be halfway to Aberdeen -- somewhere in the Highlands, somewhere remote, hilly and wild -- so that is what the wasteland became. You don't like exercise, so all the walking is putting you in a bad mood. This place, it reacts to how you feel. When you got angry, that brought the cloud, the wind… and the dark. The darker your mind, the longer and darker the nights." He looked across at her, trying to read her reaction. She stared back at him, drinking in his every word. A sly smile spread across his lips. "In fact, I look like I do because of you too."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我之前就说过，你的身体是你心像的投射。这片荒原也是一样的。”他停了一下，看她踉踉跄跄的，赶紧抓住她的胳膊。她的全部注意力都放在他说的话上，没有注意脚下，“当你从隧道出来的时候，你估摸着自己离阿伯丁还有一半路—身处高原的某个地方，一个偏远、多山、荒凉的地方—所以荒原也就成了这个样子．你不喜欢锻炼，所以只要一走路，你的心情就糟透了。这片地方反映了你的所思所感。当你生气的时候，这里就阴云密布，狂风大作……一片漆黑。你的心里越阴郁，夜晚也就越黑暗。”他望着她，尽力读懂她心里的反应。她回望着他，入神地听着他的每一句话。一丝狡黠的微笑浮上了他的嘴角，“实际上，我之所以看起来是这个样子也是因为你。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You are such a…" Appropriate insults seemed to fail Dylan, and she stormed onwards, stamping angrily up the hill. She didn't even turn round to check if he was following. The dark clouds that had ringed the horizon just ten minutes earlier now rumbled forward, coating the sky and darkening the atmosphere.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你这个……”迪伦似乎想不起合适的词骂他，于是发足向山上狂奔，每走一步都怒气冲冲的，也不转身看看崔斯坦是不是跟在后面。十分钟前还环绕天边的乌云现在隆隆地朝前压过来，遮天蔽日，一时间天昏地暗。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They stood facing each other, Dylan breathing heavily through exertion and emotion, Tristan exuding calm, only his eyes wary. He took another quick glance at the sky, the clouds were almost black. Drops of rain began to fall, thick heavy globules of cold water that left dark, circular stains on their clothes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们面对面站着。迪伦又累又怒，呼吸声非常沉重。崔斯坦显得很冷静，只有眼神透着小心谨慎。他又扫了一眼天空，云几乎是黑色的。开始下雨了，密集而冰冷的水珠在他们的衣服上留下斑斑点点黑色的污迹。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Look," he began, "that was mean. I'm sorry. But you see, we have to make you follow us. If you refuse to come with us, if you wander off on your own… well, you've seen those things. You wouldn't last through day one, and you'd never find your way across even if they didn't get you. You'd wander here for ever." He searched her eyes, watching for a reaction to his words, but her expression remained unchanging.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“瞧，”他终于开了口，“这雨太讨厌了。对不起，但是你瞧，我们必须得让你们跟着我们。如果你们不愿意跟着我们走，如果你们自己在这里走来走去……好吧，你已经看见那些东西了。你一天也挺不下去，即使它们不抓你，你也找不到穿过荒原的路，你就会永远在这儿漂泊下去。”他搜索着她的眼神，观察她对这番话的反应，但是她依然无动于衷。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You pretend to be someone's love, their soul mate, to trick them into believing you?" Dylan spat the words at him, nauseated. How could he use a person's most treasured memories, toy with their emotions like that? It made her sick to her stomach.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你假装是别人的爱人，他们的精神伴侣，然后骗他们相信你？”迪伦厉声质问道，心里说不出的厌恶。他怎么能如此利用、玩弄一个人最珍贵的记忆呢？这让她觉得恶心反胃。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tristan shrugged. "I just know. I know them. Inside. Their past, their likes. Dislikes. Their feelings, hopes and dreams." Dylan's eyes widened as he spoke. What, then, did he know about her? She swallowed as a list of secrets, of private moments, flashed in her head, but Tristan wasn't finished. "Sometimes I take the form of someone they've lost, like a spouse." Catching sight of her face, he immediately realised that he'd said too much.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="崔斯坦肩一耸，“我就是知道。我了解他们的内心世界，他们的过去，他们的爱憎，他们的感情、希望和梦想。”他说话时迪伦把眼睁得老大。那么，他都了解自己的什么？一连串的秘密、私密的时刻一下子都浮现在她的脑海，迪伦不禁干咽了一下。但是崔斯坦还在接着说：“有时候，我会化身为他们已经失去的人，比如配偶。”他看了看她的脸色，马上发觉自己说得太多了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The rain was falling harder now, bouncing off the ground. It had soaked through Dylan's hair and ran down her face like phantom tears. The wind had picked up too, sweeping off the mountain and exploiting every hole in their clothing. Dylan shivered, folding her arms across her chest in a vain attempt to hold in some warmth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="雨下得更大了，雨水打在地上四处飞溅。迪伦的头发已经淋透了，水顺着脸往下淌，看上去如同泪水。风势也加强了，狂风掠过山峦，钻进他们衣服上的每一个缝隙。迪伦浑身颤抖，抱臂护住前胸想暖和一点，却无济于事。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Tristan was angry. Angry at himself for making fun of her and causing the whole conversation that had made her face twist into an expression of disgust and abhorrence. She had made him feel deceitful, like a common trickster who played on the emotions of people to get what they wanted. He did not expect her to understand, but she had seen the demons, she knew the stakes. Sometimes it was necessary to be cruel; sometimes the end did justify the means.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="崔斯坦心里生气，恨自己开她的玩笑招来一场争吵，连她都变得有点面目可憎了。她让他感觉自己虚伪狡诈，就像那些骗子一样，通常利用人们的感情得到自己想要的东西。他并不指望她能够理解自己，但是她也见识过那些恶魔了，她知道要冒多大的风险。有时候必须要残忍，有时候为达目的真的可以不择手段。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At midday they took a break, halfway down a hill on a little ledge that offered shelter from the wind and breathtaking views of the rolling countryside. There was a thick covering of clouds, but they didn't look like they held any rain. Dylan sat down on the rock floor, not caring that it was cold and chilled her through the thick denim of her jeans. She stretched out her legs in front of her and leaned back against the rocky hill. Tristan didn't sit beside her, but stood at the front of the ledge, staring out across the hills with his back to her. It might have looked like a protective gesture, but Dylan was sure that he was simply avoiding conversation. She chewed on a jagged nail, wanting to smooth things over but not sure how to fix it. She didn't want to bring the subject back up again for fear of making things worse, but she couldn't think of anything to say that wouldn't sound false. How could she bring back the mood from earlier? Reawaken the jokey, carefree Tristan? She didn't know.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="正午时分，他们下山的路走了一半，暂时在一处微微向外突出的岩石那里歇脚。这里可以避风，还能一览连绵不绝、令人惊叹的山野景色。云层很厚，但看起来没有蓄雨。迪伦坐在岩石上，岩石渗出的寒气穿透了她厚厚的牛仔裤，但她丝毫不在乎。她伸着腿，靠着山岩。崔斯坦没有坐在她旁边，而是站在岩架前面俯瞰群山，背对着迪伦。这个姿势似乎像是在自我保护，但迪伦清楚他只是想躲着不和她说话。她咬着参差不齐的指甲，想要缓和一下关系，却不知该怎样做才能重归于好。她不想旧事重提，生怕把事情弄得更糟，然而一时又想不出该说些什么才能听起来不那么刻意。她该怎样才能回到之前的心境中去呢？怎样才能重新唤醒那个开开玩笑、无忧无虑的崔斯坦呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She was also trying to imagine how it would feel not to have your own identity. To be defined entirely by those around you, never to have a moment alone. Not even knowing your own face. She couldn't envisage it and, for once, was glad to be her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她也尽力去想象如果一个人没有了自己的身份该是什么样的感受。自我完全由身边的人界定，永远没有独处的时刻，甚至连自己本来的相貌都不知道。她想不下去了。这一次她很欣慰自己还是自己。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dylan was full of guilt and pity. She knew that she had hurt him when she'd accused him of being uncaring. She hadn't meant the words to come out so viciously, but the idea of someone pretending to be your mother, your father or, worse still, the love of your life… It was an appalling thought. But maybe he was right; here the consequences to a wrong decision were frightening. It was life or death. More than life or death. A far cry from the petty squabbles that had seemed so significant in her old life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="而迪伦心中满是内疚和同情。她知道自己指责他麻木不仁的时候已经伤害了他。这样的恶言恶语并不是出于她的本心，但一想到有人假装成你的母亲、你的父亲，或者更糟的是，假装成你生命中的挚爱……这样的想法太可怕了。但是，或许他这样做是对的。在这个地方，做出错误决定的代价让人不寒而栗。这是生死攸关的大事，重要性甚至超越了生死。那些在她以前的生命中看似重要的争吵，其实都是鸡毛蒜皮的小事，跟这个相比更是有天壤之别。">查看中文翻译</div>
