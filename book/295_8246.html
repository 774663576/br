<div class="line_en">After unpacking her bags and picking up her keys and mail from Ella, she poured herself a glass of wine, went to the stereo, and popped in the John Coltrane CD she had bought. As the sound of jazz filtered through the room, she sorted through the mail. As usual, it was mainly bills, and she put them aside for another time.</div>

<div class="line_en">She unlocked the door to her apartment and Harvey came running from the back bedroom. He rubbed against her leg, purring softly, and Theresa picked him up and brought him to the refrigerator. She took out a piece of cheese and gave it to Harvey while she stroked his head, grateful that her neighbor Ella had agreed to look after him while she was away. After he finished the cheese, he jumped from her arms and ambled toward the sliding glass doors that led to the back patio. The apartment was stuffy from being closed up, and she slid the doors open to air it out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她一打开公寓门，哈维就从后面的卧室跑出来，欢快地迎接她。它在她腿边蹭，喉咙里发出咕噜咕噜的叫声，特丽莎一把抱起它，将它抱到冰箱旁。她拿出一片奶酪，一边疼爱地抚摸着它的脑袋一边喂给它吃，很感激邻居埃拉同意在她离开期间帮忙照顾它。吃完奶酪后，它从她臂弯里跳下，慢步朝通往后露台的推拉玻璃门走去。公寓因长时间关闭有点闷，她推开门，让房子彻底通通风。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There were eight messages on her recorder when she checked it. Two were from men she had dated in the past, asking her to call if she had a chance. She thought about it briefly, then decided against it. Neither of them was attractive to her, and she didn't feel like going out just because she had a break in her schedule. She also had calls from her mother and sister, and she made a note to call them sometime this week. There were no calls from Kevin. By now he was rafting and camping with his father somewhere in Arizona.</div>

<div class="line_en">She thought about the two weeks of vacation she still had left this year. She and Kevin would spend some time at the beach because she had promised him they would. But that left another week. She could use it around Christmas, but this year Kevin would be at his father's, so there didn't seem to be much point in that. She hated spending Christmas alone-it had always been her favorite holiday-but she didn't have a choice, and she decided that dwelling on that fact was useless. Maybe she could go to Bermuda or Jamaica or somewhere else in the Caribbean-but then, she didn't really want to go alone, and she didn't know who else would go with her. Janet might be able to, but she doubted it. Her three kids kept her busy, and Edward most likely couldn't get the time off work. Perhaps she could use the week to do the things around the house she had been meaning to do... but that seemed like a waste. Who wanted to spend their vacation painting and hanging wallpaper?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她想起今年还剩下两周假期。她和凯文可以去海滩上度假，因为她向他承诺过。但是还剩下一周。她可以在圣诞节的时候用掉，但是今年凯文会去他父亲那里过圣诞节，因此大张旗鼓筹办节日似乎没有什么意义。她讨厌一个人过圣诞节——圣诞节一直都是她最喜欢的节日——但是她没得选。她最后决定，老想这件事也白搭，也许她可以去百慕大或牙买加或加勒比的某个地方——但是，话说回来，她并不真正想一个人前往，她也不知道还有谁愿意跟她一起去。珍妮特也许可以，但是她不能确定。三个孩子让她忙得昏天黑地，爱德华很有可能没空休假。也许她可以用那周来装修房子，那是她一直想做却没有时间做的……但转念一想又感觉那似乎太浪费了。谁会愿意将宝贵的假期用在粉刷和贴壁纸上？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Without Kevin, the house seemed strangely silent. It was tidy as well, though, and this somehow made it a little easier. It was nice to come home to a house and only have to clean up after herself once in a while.</div>

<div class="line_en">She got into bed and picked up one of the novels she had started at Cape Cod. She read quickly and without distraction and finished almost a hundred pages before she was tired. At midnight she turned off the light. That night, she dreamed she was walking along a deserted beach, though she didn't know why.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她爬上床，拿起一本她在科德角湾开始读的小说。她读得很快，没有分心，一口气读了一百页才有些累了。午夜时分，她关掉了灯。那晚，她梦到自己一直走在一个荒无人烟的沙滩上，她不知道为什么。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The mail on her desk Monday morning was overwhelming. There were almost two hundred letters there when she arrived, and another fifty arrived later that day with the postman.

<div class="line_en">Theresa asked that her calls be put on hold, and she started opening the mail right away. Without exception, they were responses to the letter she had published in her column. Most were from women, though a few men wrote in as well, and their uniformity of opinion surprised her. One by one, she read how much they had been touched by the anonymous letter. Many asked if she knew who the writer was, and a few women suggested that if the man was single, they wanted to marry him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特丽莎让接线员将她的电话暂时推掉，然后立即开始拆信。无一例外，都是对她在专栏中刊登的那封信做出的回应。大部分来自女性，尽管也有几个男人，他们意见的一致性让她颇为吃惊。一封接着一封，她感受到他们究竟被这封匿名信感动到何种程度。大部分都问她是否知道这位神秘的写信人是谁，有几个女人甚至暗示如果他单身，她们想要嫁给他。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She discovered that almost every Sunday edition across the country had run the column, and the letters came from as far away as Los Angeles. Six men claimed they had written the letter themselves, and four of them wanted royalties for it-one even threatened legal action. But when she examined their handwriting, none of them even remotely resembled the letter's.</div>

She hadn't worked on her next column at all, and she felt the pressure building behind her neck, as it usually did when her deadline approached. At five-thirty she started working on a column about Kevin being away and what that was like for her. It was going better than she expected and she was almost finished when her phone rang.</div>

<div class="line_en">She watched it as it fell to the tray beneath and heard the sound of the fax machine as it copied the letter line for line. It went quickly-it took only ten seconds to copy a page-but even that wait seemed too long. Then a third page started printing, and she realized that, like the letter she had found, this one too must have covered both sides.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她看着它滑进下面的托盘里，然后听到传真机一行一行地复印信件内容。速度很快——几秒钟便复印出一张——但甚至是这短暂的等待都似乎太过漫长。然后开始复印第三张，她意识到，就像她拾到的那封信，这一封必定也是双面写得满满的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She reached for the copies as the fax machine beeped, signaling an end to the transmission. She took them to her desk without reading them and placed them facedown for a couple of minutes, trying to slow her breathing. It's only a letter, she told herself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="传真机响起了“嘟嘟”声，是传输结束的信号，她伸手去拿复印纸。她没有看，而是将它们拿到办公桌上，面朝下放了几分钟，试着平缓呼吸。只不过是一封信而已，她暗暗告诉自己。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I don't know the answer to these questions, no matter how hard I try to understand. The reason is plain, but my mind forces me to dismiss it and I am torn by anxiety in all my waking hours. I am lost without you. I am soulless, a drifter without a home, a solitary bird in a flight to nowhere. I am all these things, and I am nothing at all. This, my darling, is my life without you. I long for you to show me how to live again.</div>

<div class="line_en">I try to remember the way we once were, on the breezy deck of Happenstance. Do you recall how we worked on her together? We became a part of the ocean as we rebuilt her, for we both knew it was the ocean that brought us together. It was times like those that I understood the meaning of true happiness. At night, we sailed on blackened water and I watched as the moonlight reflected your beauty. I would watch you with awe and know in my heart that we'd be together forever. Is it always that way, I wonder, when two people are in love? I don't know, but if my life since you were taken from me is any indication, then I think I know the answers. From now on, I know I will be alone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我努力回想我们过去的点点滴滴，在“意外号”的甲板上，微风拂面。你还记得我们当初是如何一起修建她的吗？在重修她的过程中，我们变成了大海的一部分，因为我们俩都知道是大海让我们在人海中相遇。在那样的时刻我领悟到了真正幸福的意义。晚上，我们在暗黑的海水上航行，月光下，我凝望着你，惊叹你美若天仙，久久不能挪开双眼。我心中无比地确定，我们将比翼双飞，天长地久。恋爱中的人是不是全都这样？我不知道，如果说命运把你从我身边夺走是对我人生的某种提示，那么我想我知道了答案。从现在起，我将孑然一身，孤独终老。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I think of you, I dream of you, I conjure you up when I need you most. This is all I can do, but to me it isn't enough. It will never be enough, this I know, yet what else is there for me to do? If you were here, you would tell me, but I have been cheated of even that. You always knew the proper words to ease the pain I felt. You always knew how to make me feel good inside.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我思念你，对你魂牵梦萦。当我最需要你的时候，我乞求上天能将你带回来。亲爱的，我能做到的也只有这些，但是对我来说，这远远不够。也永远不够，我知道。然而，我不过是一介凡夫俗子，无力回天，还能做什么呢？如果你在这里，你就能告诉我，然而甚至是你也狠心地欺骗了我。你总是知道该说什么来平息我的痛苦，你总是知道如何让我内心感得舒服。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After reading the letter, she leaned back in her chair and brought her fingers to her lips. The sounds from the newsroom seemed to be coming from someplace far away. She reached for her purse, found the initial letter, and laid the two next to each other on her desk. She read the first letter, followed by the second one, then read them in reverse order, feeling almost like a voyeur of sorts, as if she were eavesdropping on a private, secret-filled moment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="读罢，她向后靠在椅子上，手指扣在唇上。新闻编辑室传来的喧嚣似乎很远很远。她伸手拿自己的小提包，找到了先前那封信，将两封信并排放着桌上。她读了读第一封信，然后又读第二封，后来将它们顺序颠倒过来再读了一遍，感觉自己简直像个偷窥狂之类的人，好像她在偷听一段极其私密的空间里的对话。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A little more than a week ago she'd found the first letter, and the words had left a deep impression, though the pragmatist inside her forced her to try to put it behind her. But now that seemed impossible. Not after finding a second letter, written by presumably the same person. Were there more? she wondered. And what type of man would send them in bottles? It seemed miraculous that another person, three years ago, had stumbled across a letter and had kept it hidden away in her drawer because it had touched her as well. Yet it had happened. But what did it all mean?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一周以前，她发现了第一封信，信上的字深深印刻在了她的心上，尽管她心中盘踞的实用主义者逼迫她将其抛诸脑后。但是现在似乎是不可能了。自从发现第二封信之后就再也不可能了，也许它是出自同一个人之手。还有什么？她想。什么样的男人才会将它们装进瓶子里并丢进海里呢？三年前一个人碰巧捡到了一封，然后将它藏在抽屉里，仅因为她也被感动了，这似乎不可思议。然而它的确发生了。这一切意味着什么？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Hoping to clear her mind, she absently began to clean up the clutter on her desk. Pens went in the drawer, articles she'd used in research were filed away, the stapler was reloaded, and pencils were sharpened and set in a coffee cup on her desk. When she finished, nothing was out of place except for the two letters, which she hadn't moved at all.</div>

<div class="line_en">She knew the reason, of course. The letters were written by a man who loved a woman deeply, a man who was now alone. As a girl, she had come to believe in the ideal man-the prince or knight of her childhood stories. In the real world, however, men like that simply didn't exist. Real people had real agendas, real demands, real expectations about how other people should behave. True, there were good men out there-men who loved with all their hearts and remained  steadfast in the face of great obstacles-the type of man she'd wanted to meet since she and David divorced. But how to find such a man?</div>
