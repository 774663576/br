<div class="line_en">She frowned down at them with dismay and glanced over to where her sister Sansa sat among the other girls. Sansa's needlework was exquisite. Everyone said so. "Sansa's work is as pretty as she is," Septa Mordane told their lady mother once. "She has such fine, delicate hands." When Lady Catelyn had asked about Arya, the septa had sniffed. "Arya has the hands of a blacksmith."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她懊恼地皱起眉头，看着手里那团乱七八糟的东西，然后又偷偷瞄了瞄和其他女孩坐在一起的姐姐珊莎。每个人都说珊莎的针线功夫完美无瑕。“珊莎织出来的东西就跟她人一样漂亮。”有次茉丹修女对她们的母亲大人这么说，“她那双手既纤细又灵巧。”当凯特琳夫人问起艾莉亚的表现时，修女哼了一声答道：“艾莉亚的手跟铁匠的手没两样。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Arya glanced furtively across the room, worried that Septa Mordane might have read her thoughts, but the septa was paying her no attention today. She was sitting with the Princess Myrcella, all smiles and admiration. It was not often that the septa was privileged to instruct a royal princess in the womanly arts, as she had said when the queen brought Myrcella to join them. Arya thought that Myrcella's stitches looked a little crooked too, but you would never know it from the way Septa Mordane was cooing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="艾莉亚偷偷环视房间四周，担心茉丹修女会读出她的思想。但是修女今天可没把心思放在她身上，她正坐在弥赛菈公主身旁，脸上堆满笑容，口中连声赞美。先前当王后把弥赛菈带来加入她们时，修女就说她平生可没这种福气，可以指导公主针线女红。艾莉亚觉得弥赛菈的针线也有点歪七扭八，但是从茉丹修女的甜言蜜语听起来，旁人绝对想不到。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She studied her own work again, looking for some way to salvage it, then sighed and put down the needle. She looked glumly at her sister. Sansa was chatting away happily as she worked. Beth Cassel, Ser Rodrik's little girl, was sitting by her feet, listening to every word she said, and Jeyne Poole was leaning over to whisper something in her ear.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她又瞧了瞧自己的活儿，想找出个补救的法子，最后还是叹了口气，把针线搁到一边去了。她沮丧地看看自己的姐姐，珊莎正一边巧手缝纫，一边开心地说闲话。罗德利克爵士的女儿小贝丝·凯索坐在她脚边，认真地聆听她所说的一字一句。这时候，珍妮·普尔刚巧凑在她耳旁不知说了些什么悄悄话。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Septa Mordane raised her eyes. She had a bony face, sharp eyes, and a thin lipless mouth made for frowning. It was frowning now. "What are you talking about, children?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Septa Mordane nodded. "Indeed. A great honor for us all." Princess Myrcella smiled uncertainly at the compliment. "Arya, why aren't you at work?" the septa asked. She rose to her feet, starched skirts rustling as she started across the room. "Let me see your stitches."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="茉丹修女点头：“没错，对我们所有人来说都是莫大的荣幸。”弥赛菈公主听到这样的恭维，有点迟疑地笑了笑。“艾莉亚，你怎么不织东西呢？”她问，随即起身走来，浆过的裙子在身后沙沙作响。“让我看看你织出了什么。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It wasn't fair. Sansa had everything. Sansa was two years older; maybe by the time Arya had been born, there had been nothing left. Often it felt that way. Sansa could sew and dance and sing. She wrote poetry. She knew how to dress. She played the high harp and the bells. Worse, she was beautiful. Sansa had gotten their mother's fine high cheekbones and the thick auburn hair of the Tullys. Arya took after their lord father. Her hair was a lusterless brown, and her face was long and solemn. Jeyne used to call her Arya Horseface, and neigh whenever she came near. It hurt that the one thing Arya could do better than her sister was ride a horse. Well, that and manage a household. Sansa had never had much of a head for figures. If she did marry Prince Joff, Arya hoped for his sake that he had a good steward.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="上天真是太不公平，凭什么珊莎就拥有一切？有时候艾莉亚会这么觉得。自己出生的时候，珊莎已经两岁多了，早已没有任何东西剩下来。珊莎精于缝纫刺绣，又能歌善舞，她会吟诗作词，又懂得如何打扮；她奏起竖琴拨弦宛转，摇起钟铃悦耳轻灵。更糟糕的是，她还是大美人一个。珊莎自母亲那儿继承了徒利家族的玲珑颊骨和浓密的枣红秀发，艾莉亚则活像她父亲，发色深褐，黯淡无光；脸形细长，阴霾不开。珍妮老爱叫她“马脸艾莉亚”，每次遇上她就学起马儿嘶叫。想到自己惟一做得比姐姐好的事情就是骑马，她越发难过起来。不过珊莎不擅长管理家务，对数字也向来一窍不通，倘若哪天她真嫁给乔佛里王子，艾莉亚希望他最好有个好管家，否则后果不堪设想。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Nymeria was waiting for her in the guardroom at the base of the stairs. She bounded to her feet as soon as she caught sight of Arya. Arya grinned. The wolf pup loved her, even if no one else did. They went everywhere together, and Nymeria slept in her room, at the foot of her bed. If Mother had not forbidden it, Arya would gladly have taken the wolf with her to needlework. Let Septa Mordane complain about her stitches then.</div>

Arya had named her after the warrior queen of the Rhoyne, who had led her people across the narrow sea. That had been a great scandal too. Sansa, of course, had named her pup "Lady." Arya made a face and hugged the wolfling tight. Nymeria licked her ear, and she giggled.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="艾莉亚为她松绑，娜梅莉亚则热切地舔着她的手，她有双黄色的眼珠子，阳光一照，亮得就像两枚金币。艾莉亚用传说中率领子民横渡狭海的战士女王的名讳为小狼命名，自然也引起了不小的骚动。珊莎呢，不消说，把她的小狼叫做“淑女”。想到这儿，艾莉亚扮了个鬼脸，紧紧地抱着小狼。娜梅莉亚舔了舔她耳根，痒得她咯咯直笑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They arrived, flushed and breathless, to find Jon seated on the sill, one leg drawn up languidly to his chin. He was watching the action, so absorbed that he seemed unaware of her approach until his white wolf moved to meet them. Nymeria stalked closer on wary feet. Ghost, already larger than his litter mates, smelled her, gave her ear a careful nip, and settled back down.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="等她气喘吁吁地跑到目的地，却发现琼恩已经靠坐在窗棂上，一只脚无精打采地翘起顶着下巴。他聚精会神地注意着下方的打斗，直等到他自己的白狼站起来朝她们迎去方才回过神来。娜梅莉亚小心翼翼地靠了过去，白灵已经长得比其他几只狼都要高大，它嗅了嗅她，轻轻地咬了一下她的耳朵，然后返身趴下。">查看中文翻译</div>

She got up and ran, the wolf coming hard at her heels.</div>

<div class="line_en">To her disappointment, it was the younger boys drilling. Bran was so heavily padded he looked as though he had belted on a featherbed, and Prince Tommen, who was plump to begin with, seemed positively round. They were huffing and puffing and hitting at each other with padded wooden swords under the watchful eye of old Ser Rodrik Cassel, the master-at-arms, a great stout keg of a man with magnificent white cheek whiskers. A dozen spectators, man and boy, were calling out encouragement, Robb's voice the loudest among them. She spotted Theon Greyjoy beside him, his black doublet emblazoned with the golden kraken of his House, a look of wry contempt on his face. Both of the combatants were staggering. Arya judged that they had been at it awhile.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可令她大失所望的是，在场子上比划的只有年纪比较小的几个男孩子。布兰全身上下穿着护具，看起来活像被绑在一张羽毛床上。而托曼王子本来就胖，这一模样更是浑圆无比。他们正在老罗德利克爵士的监视下，挥舞木制钝剑相互攻击。老爵士是城里的教头，身材高大魁梧，有一把气派非凡的雪白胡须。十几个在旁围观的人正为两个小男孩加油打气，里面喊声最大的就是罗柏。艾莉亚看到席恩·葛雷乔伊站在罗柏旁边，穿着黑色紧身上衣，上面绣有他的金色海怪家徽，脸上则挂着一抹嘲讽的轻蔑。两个比武的男孩子脚步都不太稳，艾莉亚推测他们可能已经打上好一阵子了。">查看中文翻译</div>

Jon had their father's face, as she did. They were the only ones. Robb and Sansa and Bran and even little Rickon all took after the Tullys, with easy smiles and fire in their hair. When Arya had been little, she had been afraid that meant that she was a bastard too. It had been Jon she had gone to in her fear, and Jon who had reassured her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可也比做针线活儿要好玩多了。”艾莉亚回嘴。琼恩咧嘴一笑，伸手过来拨弄她的头发。艾莉亚脸红了，他们一向很亲，在所有的孩子里，就数琼恩和她遗传到父亲的长脸。罗柏、珊莎和布兰都长得比较像徒利家的人，就连小瑞肯也是笑容可掬，发红似火。艾莉亚小时候，还曾经害怕自己也是个私生子。她害怕的时候就去找琼恩，因为琼恩总能让她安心。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Arya looked. An ornate shield had been embroidered on the prince's padded surcoat. No doubt the needlework was exquisite. The arms were divided down the middle; on one side was the crowned stag of the royal House, on the other the lion of Lannister.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="艾莉亚一看，只见王子外衣上绣了一面华丽无比的盾牌，毫无疑问是极为精巧的手工。这盾牌被分为左右两半，一边是代表王室的宝冠雄鹿，另一边则是兰尼斯特家族的怒吼雄狮。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She hadn't, not at first glance, but when she looked again she found him to the back, under the shade of the high stone wall. He was surrounded by men she did not recognize, young squires in the livery of Lannister and Baratheon, strangers all. There were a few older men among them; knights, she surmised.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她原本没有看到，但仔细一瞧，便发现他站在广场后方高大石墙的阴影里，身旁围绕着她不认识的人，他们穿着兰尼斯特家和拜拉席恩家的制服，大概都是年轻侍从吧。人群里还有几个年长的，她猜多半是成年骑士。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jon chuckled. "Perhaps you should do the same thing, little sister. Wed Tully to Stark in your arms."</div>
