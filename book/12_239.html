<div class="line_en">"Let's have a drink at any rate," said Pippin. "I'm parched." He clambered on to a great tree-root that wound down into the stream, and stooping drew up some water in his cupped hands. It was clear and cold, and he took many draughts. Merry followed him. The water refreshed them and seemed to cheer their hearts; for a while they sat together on the brink of the stream, dabbling their sore feet and legs, and peering round at the trees that stood silently about them, rank upon rank, until they faded away into grey twilight in every direction.</div>

<div class="line_en">Meanwhile the hobbits went with as much speed as the dark and tangled forest allowed, following the line of the running stream, westward and up towards the slopes of the mountains, deeper and deeper into Fangorn. Slowly their fear of the Orcs died away, and their pace slackened. A queer stifling feeling came over them, as if the air were too thin or too scanty for breathing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在此同时，哈比人在盘根错节的老树脚下尽可能的赶路，沿著小溪的水流向西方山脉的方向前进，同时却也越来越深入法贡森林。慢慢的，他们对于半兽人的恐惧消退了，脚步也跟著减缓，他们觉得有种异样的感觉，彷佛这里的空气稀薄到不太适合呼吸。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At last Merry halted. "We can't go on like this," he panted. "I want some air."</div>

<div class="line_en">"I suppose you haven't lost us already?" said Pippin, leaning back against a great tree-trunk. "We can at least follow the course of this stream, the Entwash or whatever you call it, and get out again the way we came."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我猜你应该还没迷路吧？”皮聘靠著须要好几个人才能合抱的老树干躺了下来：“至少我们可以跟著这条河走，管它叫作树沐河还是什么的，一路走回原来进入森林的地方。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"We could, if our legs would do it," said Merry; "and if we could breathe properly."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“只要我们还走得动就没问题，”梅里说：“还有这里的空气也让人很不舒服。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But the Sun at any rate must peep in sometimes," said Merry. "It does not look or feel at all like Bilbo's description of Mirkwood. That was all dark and black, and the home of dark black things. This is just dim, and frightfully tree-ish. You can't imagine animals living here at all, or staying for long."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不过，至少太阳偶尔会照进这里来，”梅里说：“这里看起来，和比尔博对幽暗密林的描述完全不同，那里又黑又暗，是暗黑生物的大本营；这里只是光线微弱，树多得吓人而已。你根本没办法想像有动物居住在这里，甚至在这里待上一段时间也不可能。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes, it is all very dim, and stuffy, in here," said Pippin. "It reminds me, somehow, of the old room in the Great Place of the Tooks away back in the Smials at Tuckborough: a huge place, where the furniture has never been moved or changed for generations. They say the Old Took lived in it year after year, while he and the room got older and shabbier together -- and it has never been changed since he died, a century ago. And Old Gerontius was my great-great-grandfather: that puts it back a bit. But that is nothing to the old feeling of this wood. Look at all those weeping, trailing, beards and whiskers of lichen! And most of the trees seem to be half covered with ragged dry leaves that have never fallen. Untidy. I can't imagine what spring would look like here, if it ever comes; still less a spring-cleaning."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没错，这里的空气似乎很稀薄，好像停滞住了一般，”皮聘说：“不知道怎么搞的，这里让我想起了在大地道那边建的图克大厅。那是个很大的地洞，那边的家具大概有好几十年都没有移动过。他们说老图克就这样年复一年的居住在那里，看著家具和自己逐渐被岁月所侵蚀。自从他一百年前去世之后，那个房间就再也没人动过了。杰龙提斯是我的曾曾祖父，这就是他告诉我的，可是，那里的古旧感觉和这边根本不能比。你看看这些四处飘汤、恣意生长、横行霸道的苔藓！几乎每棵树都挂著一大堆已经枯死的树叶，看起来真不乾净。很难想像这里的春天看起来会是什么样子，甚至我都无法想像春天会不会来呢，更别提要在这边大扫除会是什么样子了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Just then they became aware of a yellow light that had appeared, some way further on into the wood: shafts of sunlight seemed suddenly to have pierced the forest-roof.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在这个时刻，他们突然发现不远的森林深处出现了一道金光，那是穿透了森林浓密顶盖的温暖阳光。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No, nor hobbits," said Pippin. "And I don't like the thought of trying to get through it either. Nothing to eat for a hundred miles, I should guess. How are our supplies?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没错，哈比人也不例外，”皮聘回答：“我也不敢想像要穿越这座森林是什么样子，我猜大概一两百哩都不会有东西吃。我们的乾粮还够吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Hullo!" said Merry. "The Sun must have run into a cloud while we've been under these trees, and now she has run out again; or else she has climbed high enough to look down through some opening. It isn't far -- let's go and investigate!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哇！”梅里说：“刚刚我们走进森林的时候太阳一定被云遮住了，现在它又跑了出来，或者也可能是它已经爬到半空，可以照进森林中的空隙了。这距离并不远，让我们去看看吧！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Low," said Merry. "We ran off with nothing but a couple of spare packets of lembas, and left everything else behind." They looked at what remained of the elven-cakes: broken fragments for about five meagre days, that was all. "And not a wrap or a blanket," said Merry. "We shall be cold tonight, whichever way we go."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不太够了，”梅里说：“我们脱逃的时候身上只有几块！兰巴斯！，其他的都留下来了。”两人万分惋惜地看著剩下来的几块精灵乾粮，这些碎片大概只够支撑五天，然后就什么都没有了。“而且我们也没有毯子，”梅里说：“不管往那个方向走，今天晚上都要忍受风寒了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They found it was further than they thought. The ground was rising steeply still, and it was becoming increasingly stony. The light grew broader as they went on, and soon they saw that there was a rock-wall before them: the side of a hill, or the abrupt end of some long root thrust out by the distant mountains. No trees grew on it, and the sun was falling full on its stony face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们发现，那里其实比他们想像的远多了，地形依旧持续的上升，地表的岩石也越来越多。随著他们的前进，四周越来越亮，很快的他们就发现眼前出现了一堵石壁，那应该是某座山丘的一部分，或是远方山脉的延伸，石壁上没有任何的树木，太阳正照在这堵岩壁上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, we'd better decide on the way now," said Pippin. "The morning must be getting on."</div>

<div class="line_en">They climbed and scrambled up the rock. If the stair had been made it was for bigger feet and longer legs than theirs. They were too eager to be surprised at the remarkable way in which the cuts and sores of their captivity had healed and their vigour had returned. They came at length to the edge of the shelf almost at the feet of the old stump; then they sprang up and turned round with their backs to the hill, breathing deep, and looking out eastward. They saw that they had only come some three or four miles into the forest: the heads of the trees marched down the slopes towards the plain. There, near the fringe of the forest, tall spires of curling black smoke went up, wavering and floating towards them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两人高高兴兴地爬上这一连串的阶梯。如果这些阶梯真的是人工打造的，那么原先准备使用它的人一定脚大腿长。不过，由于他们太兴奋了，让两人忽略了自己身上的累累伤痕，为什么这么快就已经完全痊愈，而只顾著闷著头往上爬。最后，两人终于爬到了岩壁的顶端，正好位在那老树桩的底下。然后他们一跃而上，背对著山丘，深吸一口气，看向东方。他们这才发现自己原来只走进了森林大约三到四哩左右的距离，因为树木在斜坡上延伸很长的距离，让他们有已经走了很远的错觉。就在森林的边缘处，有著浓密的黑烟窜起，向著他们飘过来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Up we go!" said Merry joyfully. "Now for a breath of air, and a sight of the land!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们上去吧！”梅里欢欣鼓舞地说：“终于可以呼吸新鲜空气，看看这里的样子了！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The twigs of the trees at its foot were stretched out stiff and still, as if reaching out to the warmth. Where all had looked so shabby and grey before, the wood now gleamed with rich browns, and with the smooth black-greys of bark like polished leather. The boles of the trees glowed with a soft green like young grass: early spring or a fleeting vision of it was about them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="树木的枝枒和根茎好像都伸了出来，渴求太阳的温暖。原先看起来死气沈沈的森林，现在成了阳光下红褐饱满的美景，灰黑色的树皮也如同打磨光滑的皮革一样细致，树干也反射著如同鲜嫩青草一样的柔和绿光，这可能是早春的迹象或是它们久远活力的残迹。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the face of the stony wall there was something like a stair: natural perhaps, and made by the weathering and splitting of the rock, for it was rough and uneven. High up, almost level with the tops of forest-trees, there was a shelf under a cliff. Nothing grew there but a few grasses and weeds at its edge, and one old stump of a tree with only two bent branches left: it looked almost like the figure of some gnarled old man, standing there, blinking in the morning-light.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在岩壁上有一系列近似阶梯的地形，从它崎岖不平的形状看来，或许这是岩石破裂和雨水冲刷所自然构成的奇观。在石壁之上，几乎与树顶平行的地方有一块空地，上面什么都没有，只有几株杂草生长在其上。还有一株老树的残干留在该处，只剩下两根弯曲的树枝，看起来像极了一位在晨光中伸懒腰的老人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“风向改变了，”梅里说：“又转向东方了，这里好凉快喔。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes," said Pippin; "I'm afraid this is only a passing gleam, and it will all go grey again. What a pity! This shaggy old forest looked so different in the sunlight. I almost felt I liked the place."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没错，”皮聘说：“可惜这只是昙花一现，恐怕一切又都会恢复原状。真可惜！这座老森林在阳光之下看起来好漂亮，我几乎觉得自己要喜欢上这个地方了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Almost felt you liked the Forest! That's good! That's uncommonly kind of you," said a strange voice. "Turn round and let me have a look at your faces. I almost feel that I dislike you both, but do not let us be hasty. Turn around!" A large knob-knuckled hand was laid on each of their shoulders, and they were twisted round, gently but irresistibly; then two great arms lifted them up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“几乎觉得你喜欢这座森林？很好！你们真是太客气了！”一个奇异的声音说：“转过身来，让我看看你们的脸。我几乎觉得我要讨厌你们两个人了，不过，最好还是不要仓促下决定。快转过身！”一双长满了树瘤的手放在两人的肩膀上，将他们轻柔，但不可抗拒地转了过来；然后，一双大手将他们举了起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They found that they were looking at a most extraordinary face. It belonged to a large Man-like, almost Troll-like, figure, at least fourteen foot high, very sturdy, with a tall head, and hardly any neck. Whether it was clad in stuff like green and grey bark, or whether that was its hide, was difficult to say. At any rate the arms, at a short distance from the trunk, were not wrinkled, but covered with a brown smooth skin. The large feet had seven toes each. The lower part of the long face was covered with a sweeping grey beard, bushy, almost twiggy at the roots, thin and mossy at the ends. But at the moment the hobbits noted little but the eyes. These deep eyes were now surveying them, slow and solemn, but very penetrating. They were brown, shot with a green light. Often afterwards Pippin tried to describe his first impression of them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="梅里和皮聘发现自己面对的是一张极端不寻常的面孔，那张脸孔属于一个类似人类，几乎有着食人妖轮廓的高大身形。他至少有十四尺高，看起来非常强韧，头长得很高，好像没有脖子，两人很难推断他到底是穿著绿灰色的树皮，还是这就是他的皮肤。不过，他们至少可以确定的是，距离躯干有一段距离的双手没有任何绉折，是褐色的光滑肌肤。他的每只大脚有七根指头，那张长脸的尾端则是被掩盖在茂密的苔藓下，迎风飘扬的灰色苔藓，看起来有点像老人的灰色胡须一般丰美。不过，此时此刻，哈比人们唯一注意到的就是那双眼睛；那双深邃的眼睛正缓慢、严肃地打量著他们。他的眼睛是褐色的，中间有著绿色的光芒。事后，皮聘试著要描述对那双眼睛，就是这样的印象。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"One felt as if there was an enormous well behind them, filled up with ages of memory and long, slow, steady thinking; but their surface was sparkling with the present; like sun shimmering on the outer leaves of a vast tree, or on the ripples of a very deep lake. I don't know, but it felt as if something that grew in the ground -- asleep, you might say, or just feeling itself as something between root-tip and leaf-tip, between deep earth and sky had suddenly waked up, and was considering you with the same slow care that it had given to its own inside affairs for endless years."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“初看到那双眼的人，会觉得那背后似乎有著十分深邃的古井，装满了远古以来的记忆和缓慢、坚定的思绪；但是水井的表面却是反射著现世的波澜，就像阳光映射在大树的枝叶上，或是阳光照射在幽深湖水中一样的感觉。我不确定，但这种感觉好像是在树顶和树根之间、大地和天空之间的什么力量突然间醒了过来，正用著亿万年以来同样的缓慢动作打量著眼前的景象。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Hrum, Hoom," murmured the voice, a deep voice like a very deep woodwind instrument. "Very odd indeed! Do not be hasty, that is my motto. But if I had seen you, before I heard your voices -- I liked them: nice little voices; they reminded me of something I cannot remember -- if I had seen you before I heard you, I should have just trodden on you, taking you for little Orcs, and found out my mistake afterwards. Very odd you are, indeed. Root and twig, very odd!"</div>

Land of the Valley of Singing Gold, that was it, once upon a time. Now it is the Dreamflower. Ah well! But it is a queer place, and not for just anyone to venture in. I am surprised that you ever got out, but much more surprised that you ever got in: that has not happened to strangers for many a year. It is a queer land."</div>

And then there are some trees in the valleys under the mountains, sound as a bell, and bad right through. That sort of thing seems to spread. There used to be some very dangerous parts in this country. There are still some very black patches."</div>

For Ents are more like Elves: less interested in themselves than Men are, and better at getting inside other things.

<div class="line_en">Treebeard strode up the slope, hardly slackening his pace. Suddenly before them the hobbits saw a wide opening. Two great trees stood there, one on either side, like living gate-posts; but there was no gate save their crossing and interwoven boughs. As the old Ent approached, the trees lifted up their branches, and all their leaves quivered and rustled. For they were evergreen trees, and their leaves were dark and polished, and gleamed in the twilight. Beyond them was a wide level space, as though the floor of a great hall had been cut in the side of the hill. On either hand the walls sloped upwards, until they were fifty feet high or more, and along each wall stood an aisle of trees that also increased in height as they marched inwards.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="树胡开始往斜坡上走，脚步并没有任何延迟，哈比人这才注意到眼前出现了一个宽阔的开口，两边各有一座高大的树木，彷佛是活生生的门柱一般。当树人靠近的时候，两株树举起枝丫，树叶也开始晃动，他们是长青树，树叶在夕阳下闪动着绿色的光芒。在两株树枝后则是一块平坦的空地，彷佛是山边被开凿出了一座大厅一样，两边的墙壁都一直往上延伸，一直到达五十尺高的洞顶为止；而两旁的树木，也随着他们越深入内部而越来越高耸挺拔。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At the far end the rock-wall was sheer, but at the bottom it had been hollowed back into a shallow bay with an arched roof: the only roof of the hall, save the branches of the trees, which at the inner end overshadowed all the ground leaving only a broad open path in the middle. A little stream escaped from the springs above, and leaving the main water, fell tinkling down the sheer face of the wall, pouring in silver drops, like a fine curtain in front of the arched bay. The water was gathered again into a stone basin in the floor between the trees, and thence it spilled and flowed away beside the open path, out to rejoin the Entwash in its journey through the forest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到了房间的另一个尽头，岩壁变得十分陡峭，但底端又挖了个凹洞，成了有着圆顶的小房间，这是大厅中除了枝叶自然构成的屋顶之外，唯一的人造屋顶。在大厅的其它地方，树木的枝叶将外界的光源全都遮住，只留下正中央的一块空隙。一道涓涓细流脱离斜坡上的小河，发出清脆悦耳的声音落到地面上，在那拱型的小屋前构成了一个透明的廉幕。这些流水又再度汇集在树木间的一个石盆中，再度喧扰地沿着入口流出去，和外面的树沐河汇流。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For a moment Treebeard stood under the rain of the falling spring, and took a deep breath; then he laughed, and passed inside. A great stone table stood there, but no chairs. At the back of the bay it was already quite dark. Treebeard lifted two great vessels and stood them on the table. They seemed to be filled with water; but he held his hands over them, and immediately they began to glow, one with a golden and the other with a rich green light; and the blending of the two lights lit the bay, as if the sun of summer was shining through a roof of young leaves. Looking back, the hobbits saw that the trees in the court had also begun to glow, faintly at first, but steadily quickening, until every leaf was edged with light: some green, some gold, some red as copper; while the tree-trunks looked like pillars moulded out of luminous stone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="树胡就这么在落下的泉水中站立了片刻，然后他深吸一口气，哈哈大笑着走进房间内。里面有一张巨大的石桌，但没有任何的椅子。房间后方由于位置的问题而显得相当黑暗。树胡拿起两个大容器，将它们放在桌子上。这两个容器里面似乎装满了水，但树胡将手拿到容器上晃动一下之后，它们就开始发光，一个是黄金色的光芒，另一个则是饱满的绿色，整个房间被这两种光芒混合的色彩给照亮了，彷佛夏日阳光透过翠绿树叶投射时所构成的景象。哈比人回头一看，发现整个洞穴中的树木也都开始发光，一开始很微弱；但慢慢的，所有的树叶边缘都染上一圈光晖，有些是绿色的，有些是金色的，有些则是如同红铜一般的颜色，而树干本身看起来像是夜光石所打造的石柱一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Hm! Here we are!" said Treebeard, breaking his long silence. "I have brought you about seventy thousand ent-strides, but what that comes to in the measurement of your land I do not know. Anyhow we are near the roots of the Last Mountain. Part of the name of this place might be Wellinghall, if it were turned into your language. I like it. We will stay here tonight." He set them down on the grass between the aisles of the trees, and they followed him towards the great arch. The hobbits now noticed that as he walked his knees hardly bent, but his legs opened in a great stride. He planted his big toes (and they were indeed big, and very broad) on the ground first, before any other part of his feet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嗯，我们到了！”树胡打破了长久的沉默：“这里大概距离之前的位置有七千步左右，但我不知道这在你们的计算中是有多远的距离。反正我们已经到了最后山脉的根脉地区，这里的名称在你的语言中应该是威灵厅。我喜欢这个地方，今晚我们就待在这边。”他将两人在两排树木之间的草地上放下来，皮聘和梅里跟着他走到拱形屋顶之前。哈比人注意到他走路时膝盖几乎不弯曲，但他的腿却可以张得很开。他会先将大脚拇指（真的很大很宽喔）先踩到地面，然后其它部分再跟着移动。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"This is an ent-house," he said, "and there are no seats, I fear. But you may sit on the table." Picking up the hobbits he set them on the great stone slab, six feet above the ground, and there they sat dangling their legs, and drinking in sips. The drink was like water, indeed very like the taste of the draughts they had drunk from the Entwash near the borders of the forest, and yet there was some scent or savour in it which they could not describe: it was faint, but it reminded them of the smell of a distant wood borne from afar by a cool breeze at night. The effect of the draught began at the toes, and rose steadily through every limb, bringing refreshment and vigour as it coursed upwards, right to the tips of the hair. Indeed the hobbits felt that the hair on their heads was actually standing up, waving and curling and growing. As for Treebeard, he first laved his feet in the basin beyond the arch, and then he drained his bowl at one draught, one long, slow draught. The hobbits thought he would never stop.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这是树人居住的地方，”他说：“所以恐怕没有可以坐的位置。不过，你们可以坐在桌上。”他将哈比人一把抓起，放到离地面六尺高的石板上，让他们踢着小脚，喝着饮料。这饮料喝起来像水一样，就和他们在森林边的树沐河中所喝到的河水味道一样，但是其中有股很难形容的香气：那味道很淡，但却让他们想起森林中晚风吹拂所带来的味道。这饮料的效力从脚指头开始，一路缓缓地往上升，让他们的四肢百骸，最后连头皮都感觉到精力充沛。哈比人觉得自己连头发都站了起来，开始迎风飘扬。至于树胡，他则是先把脚泡在大厅中央的石盆内，然后仰头缓缓地喝光碗内的东西，哈比人还以为他这一口永远都喝不完。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, well, now we can talk again," said Treebeard. "You are thirsty, I expect. Perhaps you are also tired. Drink this!" He went to the back of the bay, and then they saw that several tall stone jars stood there, with heavy lids. He removed one of the lids, and dipped in a great ladle, and with it filled three bowls, one very large bowl, and two smaller ones.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好啦，好啦，现在才可以好好的聊天了！”树胡说：“我想你们应该已经渴了，你们多半也已经累了，快喝下这个！”他走到房间的另一头，两人看见那边有好几个盖子看来十分沉重的大瓮。树胡打开其中一个大瓮，用一个大长柄杓舀出一些液体，用它装满了三个碗，一个碗很大，另外两个碗则稍微小一点。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">On the right side of the bay there was a great bed on low legs, not more than a couple of feet high, covered deep in dried grass and bracken. Treebeard lowered himself slowly on to this (with only the slightest sign of bending at his middle), until he lay at full length, with his arms behind his head, looking up at the ceiling, upon which lights were flickering, like the play of leaves in the sunshine. Merry and Pippin sat beside him on pillows of grass.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在房间右边则有一张相当低矮的床铺，不过几尺高，上面则是铺满了干草和树皮。树胡慢慢地躺上床（腰身只有些微的弯曲），直到全身都躺上去为止。然后，他用手支着脑袋，看着天花板上灿烂的光芒舞动，梅里和皮聘则是在他身边的草枕头上坐了下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At last he set the bowl down again. "Ah -- ah," he sighed. "Hm, hoom, now we can talk easier. You can sit on the floor, and I will lie down; that will prevent this drink from rising to my head and sending me to sleep."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后，他放下了碗。他满足地叹息道：“啊，哈，呼姆，嗯，这才比较适合聊天。你们可以坐在地板上，不过先让我躺下来，这样可以避免刚刚喝的东西直冲脑门，让我想睡觉。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He was immensely interested in everything: in the Black Riders, in Elrond, and Rivendell, in the Old Forest, and Tom Bombadil, in the Mines of Moria, and in Lothlórien and Galadriel. He made them describe the Shire and its country over and over again. He said an odd thing at this point. "You never see any, hm, any Ents round there, do you?" he asked.

That is a bundle of news and no mistake. You have not told me all, no indeed, not by a long way. But I do not doubt that you are doing as Gandalf would wish. There is something very big going on, that I can see, and what it is maybe I shall learn in good time, or in bad time. By root and twig, but it is a strange business: up sprout a little folk that are not in the old lists, and behold! the Nine forgotten Riders reappear to hunt them, and Gandalf takes them on a great journey, and Galadriel harbours them in Caras Galadhon, and Orcs pursue them down all the leagues of Wilderland: indeed they seem to be caught up in a great storm.

<div class="line_en">"Hoom, hm, I have not troubled about the Great Wars," said Treebeard; "they mostly concern Elves and Men. That is the business of Wizards: Wizards are always troubled about the future. I do not like worrying about the future. I am not altogether on anybody's side, because nobody is altogether on my side, if you understand me: nobody cares for the woods as I care for them, not even Elves nowadays. Still, I take more kindly to Elves than to others: it was the Elves that cured us of dumbness long ago, and that was a great gift that cannot be forgotten, though our ways have parted since. And there are some things, of course, whose side I am altogether not on; I am against them altogether: these -- burárum" (he again made a deep rumble of disgust) "-- these Orcs, and their masters."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“呼姆，嗯，我在这场大战中并没有什么责任，”树胡说：“这大半是和精灵及人类有关，大多数也都是巫师的工作，巫师们总是喜欢担忧未来，我不喜欢担心未来，我并不和任何人站在同一边，因为也没有任何人和我站在同一边。如果你了解我的意思，没有人像我这样关心树木，连现今的精灵都已经不是这样了，不过，我对于精灵依旧比对于其它种族都要有好感。许久以前是他们给了我们智能，即使我们之后分道扬镳，但这个礼物绝不可轻易忘却。而且，还有一些人、一些东西是我绝对不会苟同的。事实上，我彻头彻尾地反对他们，这些布拉鲁，”他又再度发出厌恶的哼声：“这些半兽人和他们的主人。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I used to be anxious when the shadow lay on Mirkwood, but when it removed to Mordor, I did not trouble for a while: Mordor is a long way away.

<div class="line_en">"Saruman is a Wizard," answered Treebeard. "More than that I cannot say. I do not know the history of Wizards. They appeared first after the Great Ships came over the Sea; but if they came with the Ships I never can tell. Saruman was reckoned great among them, I believe. He gave up wandering about and minding the affairs of Men and Elves, some time ago -- you would call it a very long time ago; and he settled down at Angrenost, or Isengard as the Men of Rohan call it. He was very quiet to begin with, but his fame began to grow. He was chosen to be the head of the White Council, they say; but that did not turn out too well. I wonder now if even then Saruman was not turning to evil ways. But at any rate he used to give no trouble to his neighbours. I used to talk to him. There was a time when he was always walking about my woods. He was polite in those days, always asking my leave (at least when he met me); and always eager to listen. I told him many things that he would never have found out by himself; but he never repaid me in like kind. I cannot remember that he ever told me anything. And he got more and more like that; his face, as I remember it -- I have not seen it for many a day -- became like windows in a stone wall: windows with shutters inside."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“萨鲁曼是名巫师，”树胡回答：“除此之外我就不清楚了，我并不知道巫师的过去，我只知道他们是在大船越过海洋时跟着出现的，但我不知道他们是否乘坐大船来到这块大陆。萨鲁曼在他们之中的地位很高，后来，他不再四处奔波或介入人类和精灵的事务──你们可能会说那是很久很久以前，他在安格林诺斯特定居下来，洛汗国的人又叫那个地方艾辛格。他一开始十分的低调，但他的名声不胫而走。他们说他接受了圣白议会议长的职务，但结果似乎并不怎么好，我怀疑是否那时萨鲁曼就已经落入邪道。反正，他以前并不会对邻居造成任何麻烦，我曾经和他说过话，他有一段时间经常在我的森林里面漫步。那时他总是很有礼貌，时常会请求我的许可（至少在他遇到我的时候会这样），总是愿意倾听；我告诉他许多单凭他的力量永远不会知道的事情，但他从来没有用同样的态度回报我。我不记得他告诉过我任何事情，而他这样的状况越来越严重。他的脸孔──那张我已经很久没有见到的脸孔，变成像是石墙上的窗户一样封闭，窗户内的窗廉还拉了起来。”">查看中文翻译</div>

"Some time ago I began to wonder how Orcs dared to pass through my woods so freely," he went on. "Only lately did I guess that Saruman was to blame, and that long ago he had been spying out all the ways, and discovering my secrets. He and his foul folk are making havoc now. Down on the borders they are felling trees -- good trees. Some of the trees they just cut down and leave to rot -- orc-mischief that; but most are hewn up and carried off to feed the fires of Orthanc. There is always a smoke rising from Isengard these days. Curse him, root and branch! Many of those trees were my friends, creatures I had known from nut and acorn; many had voices of their own that are lost for ever now. And there are wastes of stump and bramble where once there were singing groves. I have been idle. I have let things slip. It must stop!"</div>

He has a mind of metal and wheels; and he does not care for growing things, except as far as they serve him for the moment. And now it is clear that he is a black traitor. He has taken up with foul folk, with the Orcs. Brm, hoom! Worse than that: he has been doing something to them; something dangerous. For these Isengarders are more like wicked Men. It is a mark of evil things that came in the Great Darkness that they cannot abide the Sun; but Saruman's Orcs can endure it, even if they hate it. I wonder what he has done? Are they Men he has ruined, or has he blended the races of Orcs and Men? That would be a black evil!"</div>

And of us three, Leaflock and Skinbark are not much use for this business. Leaflock has grown sleepy, almost tree-ish, you might say: he has taken to standing by himself half-asleep all through the summer with the deep grass of the meadows round his knees. Covered with leafy hair he is. He used to rouse up in winter; but of late he has been too drowsy to walk far even then. Skinbark lived on the mountain-slopes west of Isengard. That is where the worst trouble has been. He was wounded by the Orcs, and many of his folk and his tree-herds have been murdered and destroyed. He has gone up into the high places, among the birches that he loves best, and he will not come down. Still, I daresay I could get together a fair company of our younger folks -- if I could make them understand the need; if I could rouse them: we are not a hasty folk. What a pity there are so few of us!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="过了一段时间之后，哈比人又听见他开始喃喃自语，他似乎在扳着手指头数数：“法贡、芬格拉斯、佛拉瑞夫，啊，啊…”他叹息道：“问题是我们的人数太少了！”他转过身对哈比人说：“在黑暗之前就诞生于这座森林的树人只剩下三位，法贡，也就是我；芬格拉斯和佛拉瑞夫，这是我们的精灵名字，你可以叫他们叶丛和树皮，这样比较好记。在我们三个之中，叶丛和树皮恐怕帮不上什么，叶丛已经变得太像树了，整天昏昏欲睡；他去年一整个夏天都站在那边，四周的荒草长到及膝高，他头上的树叶可是很丰美的呢！他以前在冬天的时候会醒来，但是最近他变得太迟钝，连那时候都无法走得太远。树皮则是居住在艾辛格西边的山坡上，也是麻烦最多的区域，他被半兽人弄伤了，许多他的同伴和树群们也都被杀死或是被摧毁了。他躲到更高的地方去，藏在他最爱的桦木林里面不敢下来。不过，我想我应该还是可以找到不少年轻的树人，只要我能够说服他们这次的危机有多大，只要我能让他们热血沸腾；我们可不是那种天性好斗的生物。真可惜，我们的数量实在太少了！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It is rather a strange and sad story," he went on after a pause. "When the world was young, and the woods were wide and wild, the Ents and the Entwives -- and there were Entmaidens then: ah! the loveliness of Fimbrethil, of Wandlimb the lightfooted, in the days of our youth! -- they walked together and they housed together. But our hearts did not go on growing in the same way: the Ents gave their love to things that they met in the world, and the Entwives gave their thought to other things, for the Ents loved the great trees, and the wild woods, and the slopes of the high hills; and they drank of the mountain-streams, and ate only such fruit as the trees let fall in their path; and they learned of the Elves and spoke with the Trees. But the Entwives gave their minds to the lesser trees, and to the meads in the sunshine beyond the feet of the forests; and they saw the sloe in the thicket, and the wild apple and the cherry blossoming in spring, and the green herbs in the waterlands in summer, and the seeding grasses in the autumn fields. They did not desire to speak with these things; but they wished them to hear and obey what was said to them. The Entwives ordered them to grow according to their wishes, and bear leaf and fruit to their liking; for the Entwives desired order, and plenty, and peace (by which they meant that things should remain where they had set them). So the Entwives made gardens to live in. But we Ents went on wandering, and we only came to the gardens now and again. Then when the Darkness came in the North, the Entwives crossed the Great River, and made new gardens, and tilled new fields, and we saw them more seldom. After the Darkness was overthrown the land of the Entwives blossomed richly, and their fields were full of corn. Many men learned the crafts of the Entwives and honoured them greatly; but we were only a legend to them, a secret in the heart of the forest. Yet here we still are, while all the gardens of the Entwives are wasted: Men call them the Brown Lands now."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那是个十分哀伤的奇异故事，”他暂停了片刻之后说：“当这个世界还没有这么古老的时候，森林遍布大地，树人和树妻，当时她们还是树女──啊！我还记得芬伯希尔的可爱，风枝那轻盈的步伐，在我们年轻时那快乐的时光！她们一起行动，一起居住。但我们的思绪并没有一直朝向同一个方向发展：树人把他们的爱给了在世界上遇到的其它事物，但树妻则把思绪转移到其它的东西身上。因为树人喜爱大树、野林和高山的陡坡，他们喝的是山泉水，吃的是树木自然落下的果实，他们学习精灵语，并且和树木交谈；但树妻把关怀献给了更小的植物，献给那些在森林脚底下的草本植物，她们喜爱的是野莓和春天野生的苹果及樱桃，以及夏天在荒地上生长的药草，秋天在大地上生根的草蓟。她们不想要和这些植物说话，只想要让它们听从给予它们的命令，照着她们的喜好生长出果实和树叶来；树妻喜欢秩序、丰饶和安祥（在这里，安祥的意思是每样东西都停留在树妻当初安排的位置上），因此树妻开始打造花园，变成她们的居所。但我们这些树人则是四野游荡，只会偶尔来到这些花园。然后，北方的黑暗来袭，树妻们越过了大河，在那边种植了新的花园，驯服了新的植物，我们和她们更少见面了。在黑暗被推翻之后，树妻拥有的大地开始丰收，结满了玉米的果实。人类从树妻那边学到了这技巧，对她们十分敬重；但我们对人类来说就成为单纯的传说，只是森林中的神秘意志。但当树妻的花园全都毁弃之后，我们还好好的站在这里。人类现在称呼树妻过去的花园为褐地。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I remember it was long ago -- in the time of the war between Sauron and the Men of the Sea -- desire came over me to see Fimbrethil again. Very fair she was still in my eyes, when I had last seen her, though little like the Entmaiden of old. For the Entwives were bent and browned by their labour; their hair parched by the sun to the hue of ripe corn and their cheeks like red apples. Yet their eyes were still the eyes of our own people. We crossed over Anduin and came to their land; but we found a desert: it was all burned and uprooted, for war had passed over it. But the Entwives were not there. Long we called, and long we searched; and we asked all folk that we met which way the Entwives had gone. Some said they had never seen them; and some said that they had seen them walking away west, and some said east, and others south. But nowhere that we went could we find them. Our sorrow was very great. Yet the wild wood called, and we returned to it. For many years we used to go out every now and again and look for the Entwives, walking far and wide and calling them by their beautiful names. But as time passed we went more seldom and wandered less far. And now the Entwives are only a memory for us, and our beards are long and grey. The Elves made many songs concerning the Search of the Ents, and some of the songs passed into the tongues of Men. But we made no songs about it, being content to chant their beautiful names when we thought of the Entwives. We believe that we may meet again in a time to come, and perhaps we shall find somewhere a land where we can live together and both be content. But it is foreboded that that will only be when we have both lost all that we now have. And it may well be that that time is drawing near at last. For if Sauron of old destroyed the gardens, the Enemy today seems likely to wither all the woods."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我记得那是很久以前，是在索伦和来自海上的人类之间作战的那段过去，我突然间想要再看看芬伯希尔。在我的眼中她依旧十分的美丽，不过，当我最后一次看见她的时候，她已经和当年的树女外貌上有了很大的改变。由于她们经年的辛勤工作，树妻都弯腰驼背，外皮变成棕色，她们的头发在艳阳的炙烤之下成了成熟玉米的黄色，脸颊红得像熟透的苹果一样，她们的双眼依旧是我族人民的双眸。我们越过安都因河，来到她们的大地，却发现一块荒漠；一切都被烧毁破坏，战火对该处造成了莫大的破坏，但树妻们并不在那边。我们找了又找，唤了又唤，询问所有遇到的人；有些人说他们从来没看过树妻，有些人说她们往西走、有人说往北走、有人说往南走或是往东走，但不管我们怎么找，就是找不到她们。我们非常非常地哀伤，但森林再度呼唤我们，我们只好回到此处。经过了许多许多年，我们依然会离开此地，寻找树妻，在世界各地呼喊她们美丽的名字，但随着时光的流逝，慢慢地我们放弃了这项搜寻。现在，树妻已经成了我们脑海中淡薄的回忆，我们的胡子也已经斑白飘落。精灵们做了很多歌有关树人的搜寻，有些歌曲甚至翻译成人类的语言。但我们并没有作出任何的歌谣，单单是在寂寞时吟唱她们美丽的名字就已足够。我们相信终有一天会再度和她们相遇，或许可以找到一个地方和她们斯守终老，但我们有预感，只有可能在我们都失去一切的时候才会完成这个梦想。或许这个末日已经快要到来了，因为若是古代的索伦摧毁了树妻的花园，现在的魔王恐怕会让所有的树木枯死。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Before long they set off. Treebeard carried the hobbits in his arms as on the previous day. At the entrance to the court he turned to the right, stepped over the stream, and strode away southwards along the feet of great tumbled slopes where trees were scanty. Above these the hobbits saw thickets of birch and rowan, and beyond them dark climbing pinewoods. Soon Treebeard turned a little away from the hills and plunged into deep groves, where the trees were larger, taller, and thicker than any that the hobbits had ever seen before. For a while they felt faintly the sense of stifling which they had noticed when they first ventured into Fangorn, but it soon passed. Treebeard did not talk to them. He hummed to himself deeply and thoughtfully, but Merry and Pippin caught no proper words: it sounded like boom, boom, rumboom, boorar, boom boom, dahrar boom boom, dahrar boom, and so on with a constant change of note and rhythm. Now and again they thought they heard an answer, a hum or a quiver of sound, that seemed to come out of the earth, or from boughs above their heads, or perhaps from the boles of the trees; but Treebeard did not stop or turn his head to either side.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不久之后，他们便出发了。像昨天一样，树胡抱着这两个哈比人。在洞穴的入口处，他往右边转，一脚跨过了泉水，沿着树木稀少的边坡往南边走。一路上哈比人们看见了许多丛的桦木和花楸，后方则是黑色高耸的针叶林。很快的，树胡就转了个方向，一头冲进浓密的森林里。这里的树木更大、更高，是哈比人所见过最浓密的森林。一开始，他们依旧感觉到像初进法贡森林时的气闷拥挤，但这感觉很快就过去了。树胡并不和他们交谈，他低沉的哼着曲调，似乎在思索着什么；对于梅里和皮聘来说，他口中所发出的似乎只是哼哼、呼呼、嗯嗯的节拍声，只不过音符和曲调时常变更而已。他们不时会听见森林里面传来回应，可能是哼声或是颤音，彷佛来自地面，或者是他们头上的枝叶；不过，树胡的动作丝毫没有减缓，头也没有往两边看。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They had been going for a long while -- Pippin had tried to keep count of the "ent-strides" but had failed, getting lost at about three thousand -- when Treebeard began to slacken his pace. Suddenly he stopped, put the hobbits down, and raised his curled hands to his mouth so that they made a hollow tube; then he blew or called through them. A great hoom, hom rang out like a deep-throated horn in the woods, and seemed to echo from the trees. Far off there came from several directions a similar hoom, hom, hoom that was not an echo but an answer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们走了很长的一段时间，皮聘试着想要计算树人总共走了多少步，但最后在三千步左右就搞混了；正好在同一时间，树胡也放慢了脚步。突然间，他停了下来，把哈比人放下，把手卷成杯状凑到嘴边；然后他不知道是用吹还是用喊叫的方式，发出了巨大的轰轰声，彷佛森林中独有的震耳号角声，余韵还在森林间不停地回汤。从很远的地方也传来了巨大的轰，轰，轰三声，回应他的呼唤。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Treebeard now perched Merry and Pippin on his shoulders and strode on again, every now and then sending out another horn-call, and each time the answers came louder and nearer. In this way they came at last to what looked like an impenetrable wall of dark evergreen trees, trees of a kind that the hobbits had never seen before: they branched out right from the roots, and were densely clad in dark glossy leaves like thornless holly, and they bore many stiff upright flower-spikes with large shining olive-coloured buds.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="树胡接着把梅里和皮聘扛在肩膀上，再度开始往前走，偶尔还会停下来发出同样的号声；每次的回应则是越来越近、越来越大声。就这样，他们最后来到了一堵看来是由浓密的长青树所构成的高墙，哈比人从来没有看过这种植物。它们从根部就开始长出分支，暗绿色的树叶看起来有点像无刺的冬青一样，而树上还长有许多笔直的花茎，上面拱着许多翠绿色的花苞。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Several Ents had already arrived. More were coming in down the other paths, and some were now following Treebeard. As they drew near the hobbits gazed at them. They had expected to see a number of creatures as much like Treebeard as one hobbit is like another (at any rate to a stranger's eye); and they were very much surprised to see nothing of the kind. The Ents were as different from one another as trees from trees: some as different as one tree is from another of the same name but quite different growth and history; and some as different as one tree-kind from another, as birch from beech, oak from fir. There were a few older Ents, bearded and gnarled like hale but ancient trees (though none looked as ancient as Treebeard); and there were tall strong Ents, clean-limbed and smooth-skinned like forest-trees in their prime; but there were no young Ents, no saplings. Altogether there were about two dozen standing on the wide grassy floor of the dingle, and as many more were marching in.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="已经有几名树人先到了，还有许多树人则是从别的入口进来，其它人则是跟在树胡后面。当他们靠近的时候，哈比人仔细地打量他们。起初他们以为会看到和树胡没有多大差别的树人（就像哈比人在外人眼中看来没什么差异一样），但他们很惊讶地发现自己错得离谱。他们的长相就像同样种类的树一样，但因为生长过程而外貌有了极大的不同，有些甚至像是不同种类的树一样天差地别。这其中也有几名比较古老的树人，身上长满了苔藓和树瘤，但都没有一个比得上树胡这么德高望重；另外，也有许多高大、强壮的树人，枝丫和树皮都干干净净的，仿佛是正值壮年的树木一般，不过，在场的并没有小树人。当他们抵达的时候，谷地中的草地上已经大概站了三十名左右的树人，还有许多则正在进场。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Turning to the left and skirting this huge hedge Treebeard came in a few strides to a narrow entrance. Through it a worn path passed and dived suddenly down a long steep slope. The hobbits saw that they were descending into a great dingle, almost as round as a bowl, very wide and deep, crowned at the rim with the high dark evergreen hedge. It was smooth and grassclad inside, and there were no trees except three very tall and beautiful silver-birches that stood at the bottom of the bowl. Two other paths led down into the dingle: from the west and from the east.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="树胡往左走，绕过这个巨大的围篱，几步之后就走进了一个狭窄的入口，穿过入口之后，眼前就是一道长长往下倾斜的陡坡。哈比人注意到他们正走入一个巨大的洼地，如同碗状的地形，十分的宽广，边缘则是被那道围篱围住。里面则是长满了青草，除了三株高大俊美的银桦树之外，草地上并没有其它的树木。另外两道来自东边和西边的信道，也同样通往这块洼地。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At first Merry and Pippin were struck chiefly by the variety that they saw: the many shapes, and colours, the differences in girth, and height, and length of leg and arm; and in the number of toes and fingers (anything from three to nine). A few seemed more or less related to Treebeard, and reminded them of beech-trees or oaks. But there were other kinds. Some recalled the chestnut: brown-skinned Ents with large splayfingered hands, and short thick legs. Some recalled the ash: tall straight grey Ents with many-fingered hands and long legs; some the fir (the tallest Ents), and others the birch, the rowan, and the linden. But when the Ents all gathered round Treebeard, bowing their heads slightly, murmuring in their slow musical voices, and looking long and intently at the strangers, then the hobbits saw that they were all of the same kindred, and all had the same eyes: not all so old or so deep as Treebeard's, but all with the same slow, steady, thoughtful expression, and the same green flicker.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一开始，梅里和皮聘对于树人之间的多样化感到十分的惊讶，他们在树皮、枝叶、颜色、形状、手臂和脚的长度上各有不同（甚至连手指和脚指，都有从三根到九根的差异）。有几个树人看起来就和树胡有点关系，让他们想到桦木或是橡树；不过，场中也有其它种类的树木，有些人让他们想到栗树：这些树人的皮肤是深褐色的，手指又大又长，腿则是短而粗壮；有些树人让他们联想到白杨木：又高又直的身躯，手指十分细致优雅，手臂和腿都很长；有些则让他们想到杉木（最高的树人们），其它还有银杏、椴木、柏树等等。不过，等到所有的树人到齐，都低着头用音乐般的语言交谈，并且打量着两位陌生人的时候，他才清楚意识到这群型态各异的生物都属于同一个族类；他们都拥有相同的眼睛。并非每个树人的眼睛，都像树胡一样的深邃、古老；但都同样的拥有缓慢、稳定和沉思的神情，以及同样的绿色光芒。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As soon as the whole company was assembled, standing in a wide circle round Treebeard, a curious and unintelligible conversation began. The Ents began to murmur slowly: first one joined and then another, until they were all chanting together in a long rising and falling rhythm, now louder on one side of the ring, now dying away there and rising to a great boom on the other side. Though he could not catch or understand any of the words -- he supposed the language was Entish -- Pippin found the sound very pleasant to listen to at first; but gradually his attention wavered. After a long time (and the chant showed no signs of slackening) he found himself wondering, since Entish was such an "unhasty" language, whether they had yet got further than Good Morning; and if Treebeard was to call the roll, how many days it would take to sing all their names. "I wonder what the Entish is for yes or no," he thought. He yawned.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="等到所有的人都聚集起来，围拢在树胡身边之后，他们就开始了一连串让人无法理解的对话。树人一个接一个的开始呢喃，直到所有的人都加入这一连串漫长、高低起伏的音律中为止。有些时候这声音在一边会特别强烈，有些时候则是在一边低落下来，随即又在另一边以轰鸣声再度出现。虽然皮聘听不懂对方的语言，他推测这些都是树人语，他一开始觉得这声音听起来很悦耳；不过慢慢的，他的注意力涣散，且经过很长的一段时间之后（那呢喃声并没有丝毫缓慢下来的迹象），他发现自己开始胡思乱想：既然树人语是种很缓慢的语言，那么这些家伙到底说完“早安”了没有？如果树胡要点名，那不知道又会花上多少时间念完这些家伙的名字？“不知道树人语中的‘是’或‘不是’到底怎么说？”他边打呵欠边想道。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Treebeard was immediately aware of him. "Hm, ha, hey, my Pippin!" he said, and the other Ents all stopped their chant. "You are a hasty folk, I was forgetting; and anyway it is wearisome listening to a speech you do not understand. You may get down now. I have told your names to the Entmoot, and they have seen you, and they have agreed that you are not Orcs, and that a new line shall be put in the old lists. We have got no further yet, but that is quick work for an Entmoot. You and Merry can stroll about in the dingle, if you like. There is a well of good water, if you need refreshing, away yonder in the north bank. There are still some words to speak before the Moot really begins. I will come and see you again, and tell you how things are going."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="树胡立刻意识到他的转变：“嗯，哈，嘿，我可爱的皮聘！”他说，其它的树人都立刻停下念诵，“我都忘记你们是群很着急的生物，而且聆听你们完全不懂的语言也很累人，你们可以下来了。我刚刚才把你们的名字告诉树人会议，他们也看过你们了，也都同意你们不是半兽人，也同意将你们的那一行歌谣加入古老的列表中。我们还没有讨论到其它的地方，不过，对于树人会议来说，这样算很快了呢！你和梅里可以在附近逛逛，如果你们想要喝喝水、冲冲凉，在河北岸的地方有座水井。在会议正式开始之前，我们还有不少东西要谈，到时候我会再来找你们，告诉你们事情的发展如何。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He put the hobbits down. Before they walked away, they bowed low. This feat seemed to amuse the Ents very much, to judge by the tone of their murmurs, and the flicker of their eyes; but they soon turned back to their own business. Merry and Pippin climbed up the path that came in from the west, and looked through the opening in the great hedge. Long tree-clad slopes rose from the lip of the dingle, and away beyond them, above the fir-trees of the furthest ridge there rose, sharp and white, the peak of a high mountain. Southwards to their left they could see the forest falling away down into the grey distance. There far away there was a pale green glimmer that Merry guessed to be a glimpse of the plains of Rohan.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他将哈比人放了下来，在他们走远之前，两人深深一鞠躬。从他们呢喃的抑扬顿挫和眼睛的眨动看来，这动作似乎让树人们大感兴趣。梅里和皮聘沿着之前下来的路又走了回去，从入口打量着外面的景象，远方的松树衬托着更远处高大的山脉。他们往南边看，可以看见森林一路延伸到天际，在更远的地方可以看见一丝翠绿的影子，梅里猜测那多半是洛汗的草原。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I don't know quite where we are," said Merry; "but that peak is probably Methedras, and as far as I can remember the ring of Isengard lies in a fork or deep cleft at the end of the mountains.

<div class="line_en">"So do I," said Merry. "Isengard is a sort of ring of rocks or hills, I think, with a flat space inside and an island or pillar of rock in the middle, called Orthanc. Saruman has a tower on it. There is a gate, perhaps more than one, in the encircling wall, and I believe there is a stream running through it; it comes out of the mountains, and flows on across the Gap of Rohan. It does not seem the sort of place for Ents to tackle. But I have an odd feeling about these Ents: somehow I don't think they are quite as safe and, well, funny as they seem. They seem slow, queer, and patient, almost sad; and yet I believe they could be roused. If that happened, I would rather not be on the other side."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我也很好奇，”梅里说：“我记得艾辛格是一圈岩石和小山所构成的地形，中间有块平地，再来则是正中央的一个孤岛还是高塔什么的，叫作欧散克，萨鲁曼在上面盖了座高塔。在四周的高墙上有一座门，好象还不只一座。我记得中间有条河流，是从山里面流出来的，一直流过洛汗隘口，看起来不像是树人可以轻易侵犯的地方。不过，我对这些树人有种奇怪的感觉，不知道为什么，我认为他们并不像外表看起来那么的安全和好笑。他们似乎动作很慢、诡异，而且有耐心，几乎到了让人替他们难过的地步；但是，我相信他们是可以被鼓舞起来的，如果一旦发生这种情形，我会希望自己不要和他们处在敌对的状况。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes!" said Pippin. "I know what you mean. There might be all the difference between an old cow sitting and thoughtfully chewing, and a bull charging; and the change might come suddenly. I wonder if Treebeard will rouse them. I am sure he means to try. But they don't like being roused. Treebeard got roused himself last night, and then bottled it up again."</div>

<div class="line_en">The hobbits turned back. The voices of the Ents were still rising and falling in their conclave. The sun had now risen high enough to look over the high hedge: it gleamed on the tops of the birches and lit the northward side of the dingle with a cool yellow light. There they saw a little glittering fountain. They walked along the rim of the great bowl at the feet of the evergreens -- it was pleasant to feel cool grass about their toes again, and not to be in a hurry -- and then they climbed down to the gushing water. They drank a little, a clean, cold, sharp draught, and sat down on a mossy stone, watching the patches of sun on the grass and the shadows of the sailing clouds passing over the floor of the dingle. The murmur of the Ents went on. It seemed a very strange and remote place, outside their world, and far from everything that had ever happened to them. A great longing came over them for the faces and voices of their companions, especially for Frodo and Sam, and for Strider.</div>

We have finished the first stage now; but I have still got to explain things again to those that live a long way off, far from Isengard, and those that I could not get round to before the Moot, and after that we shall have to decide what to do. However, deciding what to do does not take Ents so long as going over all the facts and events that they have to make up their minds about. Still, it is no use denying, we shall be here a long time yet: a couple of days very likely. So I have brought you a companion. He has an ent-house nearby. Bregalad is his Elvish name.

Rowan-trees grew in a circle about it, and there was water (as in all ent-houses), a spring bubbling out from the bank. They talked for a while as darkness fell on the forest. Not far away the voices of the Entmoot could be heard still going on; but now they seemed deeper and less leisurely, and every now and again one great voice would rise in a high and quickening music, while all the others died away. But beside them Bregalad spoke gently in their own tongue, almost whispering; and they learned that he belonged to Skinbark's people, and the country where they had lived had been ravaged. That seemed to the hobbits quite enough to explain his "hastiness", at least in the matter of Orcs.</div>

Yet there are no trees of all that race, the people of the Rose, that are so beautiful to me. And these trees grew and grew, till the shadow of each was like a green hall, and their red berries in the autumn were a burden, and a beauty and a wonder. Birds used to flock there. I like birds, even when they chatter; and the rowan has enough and to spare. But the birds became unfriendly and greedy and tore at the trees, and threw the fruit down and did not eat it. Then Orcs came with axes and cut down my trees. I came and called them by their long names, but they did not quiver, they did not hear or answer: they lay dead.</div>

<div class="line_en">The next day they spent also in his company, but they did not go far from his "house". Most of the time they sat silent under the shelter of the bank; for the wind was colder, and the clouds closer and greyer; there was little sunshine, and in the distance the voices of the Ents at the Moot still rose and fell, sometimes loud and strong, sometimes low and sad, sometimes quickening, sometimes slow and solemn as a dirge. A second night came and still the Ents held conclave under hurrying clouds and fitful stars.</div>

The old Ent now took the hobbits back, and set them on his shoulders again, and so they rode proudly at the head of the singing company with beating hearts and heads held high.

<div class="line_en">"Quickly?" said Treebeard. "Hoom! Yes, indeed. Quicker than I expected. Indeed I have not seen them roused like this for many an age. We Ents do not like being roused; and we never are roused unless it is clear to us that our trees and our lives are in great danger. That has not happened in this Forest since the wars of Sauron and the Men of the Sea. It is the orc-work, the wanton hewing -- rárum -- without even the bad excuse of feeding the fires, that has so angered us; and the treachery of a neighbour, who should have helped us. Wizards ought to know better: they do know better. There is no curse in Elvish, Entish, or the tongues of Men bad enough for such treachery. Down with Saruman!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“快吗？”树胡回答道：“呼姆！的确很快，比我想象得快多了。我已经有很多很多年没有看过他们这么激动了。我们树人通常不喜欢情绪上的波动，除非认知到我们的性命和树群陷入极端的危险，否则我们是不能采取行动的。自从索伦和渡海的人类宣战以来，这座森林就没有这样过了。是那些半兽人肆无忌惮的砍伐激怒了我们，而且，本来应该协助我们的邻居竟然出了我们。巫师们应该知道不能犯下这种致命的错误，他们应该知道的。不管是精灵语、树人与或是人类的语言，都没有办法描述这种恶行。我们要推翻萨鲁曼！”">查看中文翻译</div>

But Trolls are only counterfeits, made by the Enemy in the Great Darkness, in mockery of Ents, as Orcs were of Elves. We are stronger than Trolls. We are made of the bones of the earth. We can split stone like the roots of trees, only quicker, far quicker, if our minds are roused! If we are not hewn down, or destroyed by fire or blast of sorcery, we could split Isengard into splinters and crack its walls into rubble."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Of course, it is likely enough, my friends," he said slowly, "likely enough that we are going to our doom: the last march of the Ents. But if we stayed at home and did nothing, doom would find us anyway, sooner or later. That thought has long been growing in our hearts; and that is why we are marching now. It was not a hasty resolve. Now at least the last march of the Ents may be worth a song. Aye," he sighed, "we may help the other peoples before we pass away. Still, I should have liked to see the songs come true about the Entwives. I should dearly have liked to see Fimbrethil again. But there, my friends, songs like trees bear fruit only in their own time and their own way: and sometimes they are withered untimely."</div>

<div class="line_en">Pippin looked behind. The number of the Ents had grown -- or what was happening? Where the dim bare slopes that they had crossed should lie, he thought he saw groves of trees. But they were moving! Could it be that the trees of Fangorn were awake, and the forest was rising, marching over the hills to war? He rubbed his eyes wondering if sleep and shadow had deceived him; but the great grey shapes moved steadily onward. There was a noise like wind in many branches. The Ents were drawing near the crest of the ridge now, and all song had ceased. Night fell, and there was silence: nothing was to be heard save a faint quiver of the earth beneath the feet of the Ents, and a rustle, the shade of a whisper as of many drifting leaves. At last they stood upon the summit, and looked down into a dark pit: the great cleft at the end of the mountains: Nan Curunír, the Valley of Saruman.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="皮聘回头看着队伍，他发现树人的数量增加了──还是他看错了？原先光秃秃的斜坡上现在长满了树木，但它们都在移动着，难道是法贡森林整个苏醒过来，越过山丘准备开战了吗？他揉揉眼睛，怀疑是否睡意让他看到了幻影？但那些灰色的身影依旧继续往前移动，许多的枝丫中都传来了如同刺耳风声一般的声响。树人们越来越靠近高地边缘，所有的歌声也都停了下来。夜色降临，四野一片寂静，只有大地在树人脚下微微颤动和枝叶骚动的声音。最后，他们走到了高地边缘，低头看着一个幽深的黑洞：那是山脉边缘的裂谷，捻苦路纳，萨鲁曼之谷。">查看中文翻译</div>
