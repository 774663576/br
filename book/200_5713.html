<div class="line_en">Harry had a troubled night's sleep. His parents wove in and out of his dreams, never speaking; Mrs. Weasley sobbed over Kreacher's dead body, watched by Ron and Hermione who were wearing crowns, and yet again Harry found himself walking down a corridor ending in a locked door. He awoke abruptly with his scar prickling to find Ron already dressed and talking to him.</div>

<div class="line_en">There was a lot of commotion in the house. From what he heard as he dressed at top speed, Harry gathered that Fred and George had bewitched their trunks to fly downstairs to save the bother of carrying them, with the result that they had hurtled straight into Ginny and knocked her down two flights of stairs into the hall; Mrs. Black and Mrs. Weasley were both screaming at the top of their voices.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="整座房子里一片混乱。哈利以最快的速度穿上衣服，他从听到的声音猜测，似乎是弗雷德和乔治给他们的箱子施了魔法，好让它们飞下楼去，省得自己搬，结果箱子径直撞向金妮，撞得她一连滚下两层楼梯，摔在门厅里。布莱克夫人和韦斯莱夫人同时声嘶力竭地尖叫起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It took them twenty minutes to reach King's Cross on foot and nothing more eventful happened during that time than Sirius scaring a couple of cats for Harry's entertainment. Once inside the station they lingered casually beside the barrier between platforms nine and ten until the coast was clear, then each of them leaned against it in turn and fell easily through on to platform nine and three-quarters, where the Hogwarts Express stood belching sooty steam over a platform packed with departing students and their families. Harry inhaled the familiar smell and felt his spirits soar… He was really going back…</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我知道你不是。”哈利说着咧开嘴笑了。但是当赫敏和罗恩拖着箱子、抱着克鲁克山、拎着小猪的笼子朝火车头的方向走去时，哈利还是有了一种奇怪的失落感。以前每次乘坐霍格沃茨特快列车，他都是跟罗恩在一起的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“哎，没问题。”罗恩说着用惶恐不安、躲躲闪闪的目光扫了一眼哈利，“我真不愿意上那儿去，我情愿——可我们又不得不去——我是说，我根本就不喜欢去，我不是珀西。”他最后一句话说得斩钉截铁。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Right," said Harry, picking up Hedwig's cage in one hand and the handle of his trunk in the other. They struggled off down the corridor, peering through the glass-panelled doors into the compartments they passed, which were already full. Harry could not help noticing that a lot of people stared back at him with great interest and that several of them nudged their neighbours and pointed him out. After he had met this behaviour in five consecutive carriages he remembered that the Daily Prophet had been telling its readers all summer what a lying show-off he was. He wondered dully whether the people now staring and whispering believed the stories.</div>

<div class="line_en">The girl beside the window looked up. She had straggly, waist-length, dirty-blonde hair, very pale eyebrows and protuberant eyes that gave her a permanently surprised look. Harry knew at once why Neville had chosen to pass this compartment by. The girl gave off an aura of distinct dottiness. Perhaps it was the fact that she had stuck her wand behind her left ear for safekeeping, or that she had chosen to wear a necklace of Butterbeer corks, or that she was reading a magazine upside-down. Her eyes ranged over Neville and came to rest on Harry. She nodded.</div>

I recognised him the moment I saw his picture in the paper. Now, Stubby couldn't possibly have committed those crimes, because on the day in question he happened to be enjoying a romantic candlelit dinner with me.

He flicked through the rest of the magazine. Pausing every few pages, he read: an accusation that the Tutshill Tornados were winning the Quidditch League by a combination of blackmail, illegal broom-tampering and torture; an interview with a wizard who claimed to have flown to the moon on a Cleansweep Six and brought back a bag of moon frogs to prove it; and an article on ancient runes which at least explained why Luna had been reading The Quibbler upside-down. According to the magazine, if you turned the runes on their heads they revealed a spell to make your enemy's ears turn into kumquats. In fact, compared to the rest of the articles in The Quibbler, the suggestion that Sirius might really be the lead singer of The Hobgoblins was quite sensible.</div>

<div class="line_en">The coaches were no longer horseless. There were creatures standing between the carriage shafts. If he had had to give them a name, he supposed he would have called them horses, though there was something reptilian about them, too. They were completely fleshless, their black coats clinging to their skeletons, of which every bone was visible. Their heads were dragonish, and their pupil-less eyes white and staring. Wings sprouted from each wither -- vast, black leathery wings that looked as though they ought to belong to giant bats. Standing still and quiet in the gathering gloom, the creatures looked eerie and sinister. Harry could not understand why the coaches were being pulled by these horrible horses when they were quite capable of moving along by themselves.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="马车前面不再是空的了。辕杆之间站着一些动物，如果硬要给它们一个名字的话，他觉得他会管它们叫马，尽管它们的模样有点儿类似爬行动物。它们身上一点肉也没有，黑色的毛皮紧紧地贴在骨架上，每一根骨头都清晰可见。它们的头很像龙的脑袋，没有瞳孔的眼睛白白的，目不转睛地瞪着。在肩骨间隆起的地方生出了翅膀——又大又黑的坚韧翅膀，看上去似乎应该属于巨大的蝙蝠。这些动物一动不动，静悄悄地站在越来越浓的夜色中，显得怪异而不祥。哈利真不明白，这些马车明明自己就能行走，为什么还要用这些可怕的马来拉它们呢。">查看中文翻译</div>
