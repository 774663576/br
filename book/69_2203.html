While Pantalaimon paced the floor lashing his tail, his fur almost sparking, Thorold hastened to bring her stiff, reeking furs and help her into them. As soon as all the buttons were done up and all the flaps secured, she made for the door, and felt the cold strike her throat like a sword and freeze the tears at once on her cheeks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他把灯放下，照她的吩咐给她穿衣服。尽管她的脸上湿漉漉地满是泪水，她的嘴唇在颤抖，但她颐指气使的样子跟她父亲像极了。潘特莱蒙甩动着尾巴，在地板上踱着步，身上的毛都几乎竖了起来。索罗尔德匆匆忙忙地给她拿来那件硬邦邦、散发着臭味的皮衣，帮她穿上。所有的扣子刚一系好，所有的衣襟刚一掖好，莱拉便冲到门口，立刻觉得凛冽的寒气像刀子一样割着自己的喉咙，脸上的泪水马上被冻成了冰。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“什么事？”埃欧雷克问道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was a shake of snow, a clank of metal, and the bear was there. He had been sleeping calmly under the falling snow. In the light spilling from the lamp Thorold was holding at the window, Lyra saw the long faceless head, the narrow eye slits, the gleam of white fur below red-black metal, and wanted to embrace him and seek some comfort from his iron helmet, his ice-tipped fur.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="雪地上晃动了一下，传来金属的撞击声，披甲熊就在那里，他一直安静地睡在纷飞的大雪下。借着索罗尔德在窗口举着的灯光，莱拉看见了那个长长的藏在头盔后面的脑袋、露出眼睛的那道窄窄的缝隙、赤乌的金属下闪着微光的白毛，她真想拥抱他，从他的铁盔和冰冻的毛发那儿得到些安慰。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was no need to ask which way to go: the tracks of the sledge led straight out from the courtyard and over the plain, and lorek leaped forward to follow them. His motion was now so much a part of Lyra's being that to sit balanced was entirely automatic. He ran over the thick snowy mantle on the rocky ground faster than he'd ever done, and the armor plates shifted under her in a regular swinging rhythm.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不必问朝哪个方向走——雪橇留下的痕迹从院子里径直通向平原。埃欧雷克沿着这些痕迹，向前冲去。他现在跑起来的节奏几乎已经成了莱拉的一部分，她可以完全自然而然地平稳地坐在上面。埃欧雷克穿过冰雪覆盖着的凹凸不平的地面，速度比以往任何时候都快。甲胄上的金属板在莱拉下面很有节奏地晃动着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Behind them, the other bears paced easily, pulling the fire hurler with them. The way was clear, for the moon was high and the light it cast over the snowbound world was as bright as it had been in the balloon: a world of bright silver and profound black. The tracks of Lord Asriel's sledge ran straight toward a range of jagged hills, strange stark pointed shapes jutting up into a sky as black as the alethiometer's velvet cloth. There was no sign of the sledge itself -- or was there a feather touch of movement on the flank of the highest peak? Lyra peered ahead, straining her eyes, and Pantalaimon flew as high as he could and looked with an owl's clear vision.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们身后，其他披甲熊轻松地跑着，随身拖着火球发射器。道路很清晰，因为月亮高高地挂在天空，月光照着积雪覆盖的世界，跟在气球上看到的一样明亮：那是银亮与漆黑构成的世界。阿斯里尔勋爵的雪橇印迹径直通往一道参差不齐的小山，奇形怪状的锐利的山尖直刺天空，黑得如同真理仪上的天鹅绒布。现在还看不到雪橇的影子——也许在最高峰的山腰上正轻如羽毛般地飞奔？莱拉眯缝着眼睛，使劲地盯着前方看；潘特莱蒙拼尽全力飞到最高处，睁着锐利的猫头鹰的眼睛，仔细观察。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“什么事？”莱拉问道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Lyra felt lorek Byrnison change pace. Something had caught his attention. He was slowing and lifting his head to cast left and right.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时，莱拉察觉到埃欧雷克·伯尔尼松的速度出现了变化。有什么东西引起了他的注意。他放慢脚步，抬起头左右摇晃着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes," he said, on her wrist a moment later; "it's Lord Asriel, and he's lashing his dogs on furiously, and there's a boy in the back…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没错，”过了一会儿，他落到莱拉的手腕上，说道，“是阿斯里尔勋爵，他正疯狂地驱赶那几条狗，后面还有个男孩儿…”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But none of the bears were looking up: their attention was all on the earth. It wasn't the Aurora, after all, that had caught lorek's attention. He was standing stock-still now, and Lyra slipped off his back, knowing that his senses needed to cast around freely. Something was troubling him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，没有一只熊抬头往天上看：他们的注意力全都集中在地面上。实际上，引起埃欧雷克注意的并不是极光。此时，他一动不动地站着，莱拉从他后背上滑下来，知道他需要不受任何羁绊地感受四周的环境。有什么东西让他感到心神不安。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He didn't say. He was listening intently, but she could hear nothing. Then she did hear something: a mysterious, vastly distant rustling and crackling. It was a sound she had heard before: the sound of the Aurora. Out of nowhere a veil of radiance had fallen to hang shimmering in the northern sky. All those unseen billions and trillions of charged particles, and possibly, she thought, of Dust, conjured a radiating glow out of the upper atmosphere. This was going to be a display more brilliant and extraordinary than any Lyra had yet seen, as if the Aurora knew the drama that was taking place below, and wanted to light it with the most awe -- inspiring effects.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他没有回答。他正在仔细地听着什么，但莱拉却什么也听不见。后来，她真地听到了些什么：一种神秘的、非常遥远的沙沙声和噼啪声。这是她曾经听到过的声音：是极光的声音。一条闪着亮光的轻纱不知道从什么地方垂落下来，悬挂在北方的天空上，闪闪发光。那些看不见的数以亿计的带电粒子——也许是尘埃，莱拉想——魔幻般地在高空放射着光芒。眼前的极光比莱拉见过的更灿烂、更神奇，好像极光知道了下面正在发生这一幕，它要用叹为观止的光来照亮这一切。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“是女巫！”一只熊叫了起来。莱拉高兴地转过身，松了口气。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Lyra looked around, back across the vast open plain leading to Lord Asriel's house, back toward the tumbled mountains they'd crossed earlier, and saw nothing. The Aurora grew more intense. The first veils trembled and raced to one side, and jagged curtains folded and unfolded above, increasing in size and brilliance every minute; arcs and loops swirled across from horizon to horizon, and touched the very zenith with bows of radiance. She could hear more clearly than ever the immense singing hiss and swish of vast intangible forces.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莱拉看了看周围，然后往身后看，越过宽阔的平原和远处的阿斯里尔勋爵的房子，再看他们刚才翻过的怪石嶙峋的群山，却什么也没看见。这时，极光运动得更加强烈起来。第一道轻纱抖动着，竞相摆到一边，参差不齐的帷幕在上方卷起来，又放下去，愈来愈大，愈来愈亮；一个个弧拱和圆圈在地平线上从一边滚动到另一边，用它们彩虹一样的光弧触摸天穹。莱拉比以前能更清楚地听到那股巨大的无形的力量唱出的嘶嘶声和嗖嗖声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Impossible.! she thought weakly, but it was true, for another arrow clattered off the armor of lorek, standing above her. These were not Serafina Pekkala's witches; they were from another clan. They circled above, a dozen of them or more, swooping down to shoot and soaring up again, and Lyra swore with every word she knew.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这不可能！莱拉想，感到浑身无力。但这确实是真的，因为又有一枝箭从埃欧雷克的甲胄上“吧哒”一声掉下来，插在她眼前的地上。她们不是塞拉芬娜·佩卡拉的女巫，而是另一个女巫部落。她们大约一共有十几个，从空中包抄过来，朝下俯冲射箭，然后又迅速地飞上高空。莱拉用自己所知道的全部脏话咒骂着她们。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But a heavy muzzle knocked her forward, and with no breath left to gasp she could only pant and shudder, for there in the place where she had been standing was the plume of a green-feathered arrow. The head and the shaft were buried in the snow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然，一只巨大的嘴巴猛地把她往前一撞。莱拉吓得差点儿没了气，只能大口地喘着粗气，浑身发抖，因为她刚才站着的地方插着一枝绿色的羽箭，箭头和箭杆都插进了雪地里，只有箭上的羽毛露在外面。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">lorek Byrnison gave swift orders. It was clear that the bears were practiced at witch fighting, for they had moved at once into a defensive formation, and the witches moved just as smoothly into attack. They could only shoot accurately from close range, and in order not to waste arrows they would swoop down, fire at the lowest part of their dive, and turn upward at once. But when they reached the lowest point, and their hands were busy with bow and arrow, they were vulnerable, and the bears would explode upward with raking paws to drag them down. More than one fell, and was quickly dispatched.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃欧雷克·伯尔尼松迅速下达了命令。很显然，披甲熊对于跟女巫作战是有经验的，因为他们马上便站成防御队形，而女巫们也同样顺利地进入攻击状态。她们的箭只能在近距离的时候才能射得准，为了不浪费箭，她们总是突然猛扑下来，俯冲到最低位置时再放箭，然后便立刻上升。但是，当冲到最低点的时候，因为双手拿着弓箭，所以这时候她们也容易受到攻击，披甲熊便会纵身跃起，挥着耙子一样的爪子把她们扯下来。不止一个女巫被这样拽下来，马上便被杀死了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">If she was relieved by that, her relief didn't last more than a few moments. Because from the direction in which they'd flown, she saw many others coming to join them; and in midair with them there was a group of gleaming lights; and across the broad expanse of the Svalbard plain, under the radiance of the Aurora, she heard a sound she dreaded. It was the harsh throb of a gas engine. The zeppelin, with Mrs. Coulter and her troops on board, was catching up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果说这让她松了一口气的话，那也仅有几秒钟的光景，因为她在她们飞走的那个方向，看见更多的女巫跟她们汇合了；她们周围的半空中，闪耀着一群灯光；从斯瓦尔巴特群岛上广袤的平原，在闪烁着的极光下面，莱拉听到了一个令她心惊肉跳的声音。那是汽油发动机传来的刺耳的轰鸣。那架齐柏林飞艇载着库尔特夫人和她的士兵，正往这边赶来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Lyra crouched low beside a rock, watching for a witch dive. A few shot at her, but the arrows fell wide; and then Lyra, looking up at the sky, saw the greater part of the witch flight peel off and turn back.</div>

<div class="line_en">lorek growled an order and the bears moved at once into another formation. In the lurid flicker from the sky Lyra watched as they swiftly unloaded their fire hurler. The advance guard of the witch flight had seen them too, and began to swoop downward and rain arrows on them, but for the most part the bears trusted to their armor and worked swiftly to erect the apparatus: a long arm extending upward at an angle, a cup or bowl a yard across, and a great iron tank wreathed in smoke and steam.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃欧雷克怒吼着下了一道命令，披甲熊立刻变换成另一个队形。借着空中耀眼的火光，莱拉看见他们迅速地卸下了火球发射器。先期攻过来的那些女巫也发现了他们，开始俯冲下来，向他们倾泻箭雨。但披甲熊凭借着盔甲，对此毫不在意，迅速地架起了发射器：一条长臂斜插入空中，上面挂着足有一码宽的看上去像杯子和碗一样的容器，另一头是一个巨大的铁罐子，周围冒着烟和蒸汽。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The witches were swooping so thickly above them that three fell in flames at the first shot alone, but it was soon clear that the real target was the zeppelin. The pilot either had never seen a fire hurler before, or was underestimating its power, for he flew straight on toward the bears without climbing or turning a fraction to either side.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="向下俯冲的女巫队形太密集了，因此，第一次喷射便打中了三个，她们身上着着火摔落下来。但很快人们便明白了，披甲熊真正的目标是齐柏林飞艇。也许是驾驶员从来没见过火球发射器，也许他低估了它的威力，因为他驾着飞艇，既不向上爬升，也不左右躲闪，而是径直向披甲熊们飞来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As she watched, a bright flame gushed out, and a team of bears swung into practiced action. Two of them hauled the long arm of the fire thrower down, another scooped shovelfuls of fire into the bowl, and at an order they released it, to hurl the flaming sulfur high into the dark sky.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莱拉瞪大眼睛，只见一团火焰喷射而出，随即，一队披甲熊立刻熟练地开始行动起来。其中两只熊用力把火球发射器的长臂拉下来，另一只熊把燃烧着的火球往那个碗状容器里铲。随着一声令下，他们立即松开长臂，燃烧着的硫磺便被高高地直抛向漆黑的空中。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This time the sulfur hurtled against the envelope of the zeppelin's gas bag. The rigid frame held a skin of oiled silk in place to contain the hydrogen, and although this was tough enough to withstand minor scratches, a hundredweight of blazing rock was too much for it. The silk ripped straight through, and sulfur and hydrogen leaped to meet each other in a catastrophe of flame.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这一次，硫磺呼啸着径直飞向齐柏林飞艇上的氢气包——那是一层用油浸过的丝绸，包裹在坚硬的骨架外面，里面是氢气。虽然它很坚固，经得起不大的刮擦，但重达百磅的燃烧着的石头对它来说却远远超过了它的承受力。丝绸一下子被撕开了一个口子，硫磺和氢气迅速相遇，腾起一团巨大的火球。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then it became clear that they had a powerful weapon in the zeppelin too: a machine rifle mounted on the nose of the gondola. Lyra saw sparks flying up from some of the bears' armor, and saw them huddle over beneath its protection, before she heard the rattle of the bullets. She cried out in fear.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时，人们也都看清了，他们在齐柏林飞艇上也有一种威力巨大的武器：吊篮的前面架着一挺机枪。还没听见子弹的尖啸声，莱拉便看见有的熊身上的盔甲飞起了火星，他们蜷缩着身子，躲在盔甲下面。她惊恐地大叫起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The fire thrower worked again: this time a mass of blazing sulfur hurtled directly upward to strike the gondola and burst in a cascade of flaming fragments on all sides. The zeppelin banked to the left, and roared away in a wide arc before making again for the group of bears working swiftly beside the apparatus. As it neared, the arm of the fire thrower creaked downward; the machine rifle coughed and spat, and two bears fell, to a low growl from lorek Byrnison; and when the aircraft was nearly overhead, a bear shouted an order, and the spring-loaded arm shot upward again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="火球发射器又发射起来。这一次，一块巨大的燃烧着的硫磺呼啸着朝空中飞去，击中了吊篮，随即爆成一个个燃烧着的碎片，像瀑布一样四处飘落。齐柏林飞艇向左一转，怒吼着划了一道大大的弧线，躲到了一边，随即掉转身，向在发射器旁边迅速行动着的那队披甲熊猛冲过来。飞艇愈来愈近，发射器的长臂咯吱咯吱地放了下来。飞艇上的机枪哒哒哒地吼叫起来，两只熊倒在了地上，埃欧雷克·伯尔尼松发出一声低吼。这时，飞艇几乎已经到了他们头顶正上方，一只披甲熊一声令下，按在弹簧上的长臂便又向空中猛弹起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But the soldiers on board, and the others too (though Lyra was too far away by now to spot Mrs. Coulter, she knew she was there), wasted no time. With the help of the witches they dragged the machine gun out and set it up, and began to fight in earnest on the ground.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，飞艇上的士兵以及别的人（虽然距离太远，莱拉现在还看不见库尔特夫人，但她知道她一定在那儿）一分钟也没有耽搁。他们在女巫的帮助下，把机枪拖出来，重新架起来，一心一意地投入到地面上的战斗中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At once the silk became transparent; the entire skeleton of the zeppelin was visible, dark against an inferno of orange and red and yellow, hanging in the air for what seemed like an impossibly long time before drifting to the ground almost reluctantly. Little figures black against the snow and the fire came tottering or running from it, and witches flew down to help drag them away from the flames. Within a minute of the zeppelin's hitting the ground it was a mass of twisted metal, a pall of smoke, and a few scraps of fluttering fire.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那块丝绸立刻变得透明起来，齐柏林飞艇的整体骨架清晰可见，在地狱般恐怖的橙色、红色和黄色的火焰的映照下，在空中停留了一段长得令人不可思议的时间之后，才几乎很不情愿地飘落到地面上。借着白雪和火光，只见一个个小小的黑影跌跌撞撞地从坠落的飞艇里跑出来，女巫们也飞落下去，把他们拖离火焰。坠毁不到一分钟，齐柏林飞艇就成了一堆扭曲变形的废铁，冒着烟，零星地跳动着几个火苗。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">On they climbed. Lyra strained her eyes to look ahead, but not even Pantalaimon's owl eyes could see any movement on the flank of the mountain they were climbing. Lord Asriel's sledge tracks were clear, however, and lorek followed them swiftly, loping through the snow and kicking it high behind them as he ran. Whatever happened behind now was simply that: behind. Lyra had left it. She felt she was leaving the world altogether, so remote and intent she was, so high they were climbing, so strange and uncanny was the light that bathed them.</div>

<div class="line_en">Lyra jumped down and stood beside him to look. He was standing at the edge of a chasm.

<div class="line_cn" title="莱拉从他背上跳下来，站在他旁边望去。他正站在一个断层的边缘。到底是冰的裂口还是山岩上的裂缝，这一点很难说，也没有任何区别；最重要的是这道断层的下面黑洞洞的，深不可测。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Her heart thumping painfully with love, she turned away and set her foot on the bridge. The snow creaked under her, and Pantalaimon flew up and over the bridge, to settle in the snow on the far side and encourage her onward. Step after step she took, and wondered with every step whether it would be better to run swiftly and leap for the other side, or go slowly as she was doing and tread as lightly as possible. Halfway across there came another loud creak from the snow; a piece fell off near her feet and tumbled into the abyss, and the bridge settled down another few inches against the crack.</div>
