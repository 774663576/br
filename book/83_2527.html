<div class="line_en">I stood outside on the step and looked down the vistas of grassed terraces and trimmed trees and flowerbeds to the tall metal railing at the bottom of the gardens. I saw Carmen about halfway down, sitting on a stone bench, with her head between her hands, looking forlorn and alone.</div>

<div class="line_en">I went down the red brick steps that led from terrace to terrace. I was quite close before she heard me. She jumped up and whirled like a cat. She wore the light blue slacks she had worn the first time I saw her. Her blonde hair was the same loose tawny wave. Her face was white. Red spots flared in her cheeks as she looked at me. Her eyes were slaty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我沿着连接草坪与草坪间的红砖台阶拾级而下。等她听见我的脚步声时，我已经近在咫尺了。她跳了起来，像只小猫似的打转。她穿的是我第一次见到她时身上穿的那条便裤。她那头金发也没变，还是带着松弛的黄褐色波浪。她脸色很白。看着我的时候，她的脸颊会泛起红晕。她的眼睛是蓝灰色的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She put her thumb up and giggled. "I'm not." When she giggled I didn't like her any more. I looked around. A target hung on a tree about thirty feet away, with some darts sticking to it. There were three or four more on the stone bench where she had been sitting.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她竖起大拇指，咯咯笑了起来。“我没有。”她咯咯一笑我就不再喜欢她了。我环顾四周。三十英尺开外的一棵树上挂着一个靶子，上面插着几支飞镖。她之前坐的石凳上还放着三四支。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"For people with money you and your sister don't seem to have much fun," I said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“对于有钱人来说，你姐妹俩好像过得挺没劲的。”我说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She looked at me under her long lashes. This was the look that was supposed to make me roll over on my back. I said: "You like throwing those darts?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"That reminds me of something." I looked back towards the house. By moving about three feet I made a tree hide me from it. I took her little pearl-handled gun out of my pocket. "I brought you back your artillery. I cleaned it and loaded it up. Take my tip -- don't shoot it at people, unless you get to be a better shot. Remember?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这倒让我想起点事来。”我回头看着那幢房子。我挪动了三英尺，一棵树就把我挡住了。我从口袋里拿出她的那把珍珠柄的左轮手枪。“我把你的防身武器带回来了。枪我擦干净了，还装好了子弹。听我一句——等你练好了枪法再朝别人开枪。记住了吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Her face went paler and her thin thumb dropped. She looked at me, then at the gun I was holding. There was a fascination in her eyes. "Yes," she said, and nodded. Then suddenly: "Teach me to shoot."</div>

<div class="line_en">She came close to me and took the gun out of my hand, cuddled her hand around the butt. Then she tucked it quickly inside her slacks, almost with a furtive movement, and looked around.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她走近我身边，从我手里拿走了枪，摩挲起枪托来。她飞快地把枪塞进便裤，动作可以说有点鬼鬼祟祟的，接着四下看了看。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She smiled and made a mouth, then handed it back with a secret naughty air, as if she was giving me a key to her room. We walked up the steps and around to my car. The gardens seemed deserted. The sunshine was as empty as a headwaiter's smile. We got into the car and I drove down the sunken driveway and out through the gates.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她微微一笑，噘起嘴来，接着摆出跟我心照不宣似的淘气模样，把枪还给了我，仿佛给我的是她房间的钥匙。我们拾级而上绕到我的车前。园圃似乎都荒了。阳光空洞得好比一个餐厅服务员领班的笑容。我俩上了车，我沿着低洼的车道向下驶去，穿过了外面的重重铁门。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I drove on down the hill through the quiet opulent streets with their faces washed by the rain, bore east to La Brea, then south. We reached the place she meant in about ten minutes.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a narrow dirt road, not much more than a track, like the entrance to some foothill ranch. A wide five-barred gate was folded back against a stump and looked as if it hadn't been shut in years. The road was fringed with tall eucalyptus trees and deeply rutted. Trucks had used it. It was empty and sunny now, but not yet dusty. The rain had been too hard and too recent. I followed the ruts along and the noise of city traffic grew curiously and quickly faint, as if this were not in the city at all, but far away in a daydream land. Then the oil-stained, motionless walking-beam of a squat wooden derrick stuck up over a branch. I could see the rusty old steel cable that connected this walking-beam with a half a dozen others. The beams didn't move, probably hadn't moved for a year. The wells were no longer pumping. There was a pile of rusted pipe, a loading platform that sagged at one end, half a dozen empty oil drums lying in a ragged pile. There was the stagnant, oil-scummed water of an old sump iridescent in the sunlight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那是一条狭窄的泥路，比单根车道宽不了多少，挺像某家山麓牧场的入口。一扇装有五道栅栏的大门向后敞着，靠在一个树桩上，看上去已经多年未关了。道路两旁种满了高大的桉树，路面上尽是深深的车辙。四下很空，太阳又出来了，路上没有灰尘飞扬。之前那场雨太大了，又刚过去不久。我沿着车辙前行，说来奇怪，城市往来车辆的嘈杂声音竟很快变得只是隐约可闻了，仿佛这地方根本不属于什么城市，而是梦境中的一方远土。只见那低矮的木井架伸出沾满油污、一动不动的步进梁戳起在一根树枝上面。还看到了那连接这根和其他五六根步进梁的锈迹斑斑的旧钢缆。那些步进梁不工作了，或许已经整整一年没有动过了。油井早已不出油了。地上放着一堆油管，有个装卸平台一头塌陷了，还有半打空油桶横七竖八堆叠着。一个废水池里盛着一汪漂着油渣的臭水，在阳光照射下映出五颜六色。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It's about time. The smell of that sump would poison a herd of goats. This the place you had in mind?"</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“嗯——哼？怎样？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's beautiful." I pulled up beside the loading platform. We got out. I listened. The hum of the traffic was a distant web of sound, like the buzzing of bees. The place was as lonely as a churchyard. Even after the rain the tall eucalyptus trees still looked dusty. They always look dusty. A branch broken off by the wind had fallen over the edge of the sump and the flat leathery leaves dangled in the water.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“漂亮。”我把车停在了装卸平台旁边。我们走了下来。我听了听。往来车辆的嗡嗡声成了远处的一张声音网，宛若蜂鸣。这地方犹如墓园般孤寂。虽然下过雨，那些桉树还是灰蒙蒙的。它们永远是灰蒙蒙的样子。一根被风吹断的树枝悬在废水池边缘，皮革似的扁平叶子垂进了水里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I walked around the sump and looked into the pump-house. There was some junk in it, nothing that looked like recent activity. Outside a big wooden bull wheel was tilted against the wall. It looked like a good place all right.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我绕着废水池走了一圈，朝泵房里望了望。里面有一些垃圾，没有任何新近的活动迹象。房子外面，一个大号的木轮斜靠在墙上。看来确实是个练枪的好地方。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I went back to the car. The girl stood beside it preening her hair and holding it out in the sun. "Gimme," she said, and held her hand out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我回到车前。那姑娘站在车旁整理头发，一边捏着发丝举到阳光下。“给我。”说完，她伸出手来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I took the gun out and put it in her palm. I bent down and picked up a rusty can.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Take it easy now," I said. "It's loaded in all five. I'll go over and set this can in that square opening in the middle of that big wooden wheel. See?" I pointed. She ducked her head, delighted. "That's about thirty feet. Don't start shooting until I get back beside you. Okey?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“现在放轻松，”我说，“五发子弹装好了。我先过去把这罐头放在那个大木轮中间的方形口子里。看到了吗？”我指了指。她狠狠点了点头，很高兴。“大概有三十英尺远。等我回到你身边后再开枪。好吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Okey," she giggled.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好的。”她咯咯笑着说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The gun pointed at my chest. Her hand seemed to be quite steady. The hissing sound grew louder and her face had the scraped bone look. Aged, deteriorated, become animal, and not a nice animal.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="枪口对准了我的胸膛。她的手似乎一点不晃。她嘴里的嘶嘶声更响了，她的脸白得像剔去血肉的骷髅。苍老、堕落，变成了野兽，而且是猛兽。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I stopped dead, the sump water stagnant and stinking at my back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我呆住了，那潭死水在我背后发出阵阵恶臭。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I went back towards her around the sump. When I was about ten feet from her, at the edge of the sump, she showed me all her sharp little teeth and brought the gun up and started to hiss.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我绕过废水池，朝她走回去。当我贴着废水池边缘走到离她大约十英尺的时候，她对我露出了满口尖利的小牙齿，举起抢，嘴里开始发出嘶嘶的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I went back around the sump and set the can up in the middle of the bull wheel. It made a swell target. If she missed the can, which she was certain to do, she would probably hit the wheel. That would stop a small slug completely. However, she wasn't going to hit even that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我走回到废水池另一边，把铁罐放在那个木轮的中间。这靶子棒极了。如果她打不中罐头——这是肯定的，她可能会击中木轮，那子弹就不至于飞到远处去。不过，她要打的甚至不是那个木轮。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="我对她笑了笑，迈步走过去。我看到她纤小的手指扣紧了扳机，指尖泛白。我走到离她六英尺左右时，她开枪了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I caught her as she fell. She was already unconscious. I pried her teeth open with both hands and stuffed a wadded handkerchief in between them. It took all my strength to do it. I lifted her up and got her into the car, then went back for the gun and dropped it into my pocket. I climbed in under the wheel, backed the car and drove back the way we had come along the rutted road, out of the gateway, back up the hill and so home.</div>

<div class="line_en">Her hand holding the empty gun began to shake violently. The gun fell out of it. Her mouth began to shake. Her whole face went to pieces. Then her head screwed up towards her left ear and froth showed on her lips. Her breath made a whining sound. She swayed.</div>
