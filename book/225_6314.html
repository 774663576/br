<div class="line_en">A favourite at the Old Bailey, and eke at the Sessions, Mr. Stryver had begun cautiously to hew away the lower staves of the ladder on which he mounted. Sessions and Old Bailey had now to summon their favourite, specially, to their longing arms; and shouldering itself towards the visage of the Lord Chief Justice in the Court of King's Bench, the florid countenance of Mr. Stryver might be daily seen, bursting out of the bed of wigs, like a great sunflower pushing its way at the sun from among a rank garden-full of flaring companions.</div>

<div class="line_en">Those were drinking days, and most men drank hard. So very great is the improvement Time has brought about in such habits, that a moderate statement of the quantity of wine and punch which one man would swallow in the course of a night, without any detriment to his reputation as a perfect gentleman, would seem, in these days, a ridiculous exaggeration. The learned profession of the law was certainly not behind any other learned profession in its Bacchanalian propensities; neither was Mr. Stryver, already fast shouldering his way to a large and lucrative practice, behind his compeers in this particular, any more than in the drier parts of the legal race.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那时是纵饮的时代。大部分人喝酒都很厉害。不过时光已大大地改良了这类风气。在目前，若是朴实地陈述那时一个人一个晚上所能喝下的葡萄酒和混合酒的分量，而且说那丝毫无碍于他正人君子的名声，现在的人是会看作一种荒唐可笑的夸张的。在酒神崇拜的癖好方面，法律这种依靠学识的职业肯定不会比其他依靠学识的职业表现逊色。正在横冲直撞，迅速创建规模更大、收入更丰的业务天地的斯特莱佛先生在这方面跟其他方面一样也是不会比法律界的同行逊色的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sydney Carton, idlest and most unpromising of men, was Stryver's great ally. What the two drank together, between Hilary Term and Michaelmas, might have floated a king's ship. Stryver never had a case in hand, anywhere, but Carton was there, with his hands in his pockets, staring at the ceiling of the court; they went the same Circuit, and even there they prolonged their usual orgies late into the night, and Carton was rumoured to be seen at broad day, going home stealthily and unsteadily to his lodgings, like a dissipated cat. At last, it began to get about, among such as were interested in the matter, that although Sydney Carton would never be a lion, he was an amazingly good jackal, and that he rendered suit and service to Stryver in that humble capacity.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="西德尼。卡尔顿是最懒惰最没出息的人，却是斯特莱佛最好的盟友。他俩从希拉里期到米迦勒节之间在一起灌下的酒可以浮起一艘豪华巨轮。斯特莱佛无论在什么地方打官司，都少不了有卡尔顿在那儿两手放在口袋里，双眼瞪着天花板。即使在他们一起参加巡回审判时也照常喝到深夜。还有谣言说，有人看见卡尔顿大白天醉得像只放纵的猫，歪歪倒倒地溜回寓所去。最后，对此事感到兴趣的人风闻，虽然西德尼。卡尔顿永远成不了狮子，却是一匹管用得惊人的豺狗，他为斯特莱佛办案子，做工作，扮演的就是那个卑贱的角色。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It had once been noted at the Bar, that while Mr. Stryver was a glib man, and an unscrupulous, and a ready, and a bold, he had not that faculty of extracting the essence from a heap of statements, which is among the most striking and necessary of the advocate's accomplishments. But, a remarkable improvement came upon him as to this. The more business he got, the greater his power seemed to grow of getting at its pith and marrow; and however late at night he sat carousing with Sydney Carton, he always had his points at his fingers' ends in the morning.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有一回法院曾经注意到斯特莱佛先生尽管能说会道、肆无忌惮、冲动胆大，却缺少从一大堆陈述中抓住要害的能力，而这却是律师行当所绝不可少的最为触目的才能。不过他在这方面却取得了惊人的进步。他到手的业务越多，他抓住精髓的能力也似乎越强。不管他晚上跟西德尼。卡尔顿一起狂饮烂醉到多晚，一到早上他总能抓住要害，阐述得头头是道。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The lion then composed himself on his back on a sofa on one side of the drinking-table, while the jackal sat at his own paper-bestrewn table proper, on the other side of it, with the bottles and glasses ready to his hand. Both resorted to the drinking-table without stint, but each in a different way; the lion for the most part reclining with his hands in his waistband, looking at the fire, or occasionally flirting with some lighter document; the jackal, with knitted brows and intent face, so deep in his task, that his eyes did not even follow the hand he stretched out for his glass -- which often groped about, for a minute or more, before it found the glass for his lips. Two or three times, the matter in hand became so knotty, that the jackal found it imperative on him to get up, and steep his towels anew. From these pilgrimages to the jug and basin, he returned with such eccentricities of damp headgear as no words can describe; which were made the more ludicrous by his anxious gravity.</div>

<div class="line_en">At length the jackal had got together a compact repast for the lion, and proceeded to offer it to him. The lion took it with care and caution, made his selections from it, and his remarks upon it, and the jackal assisted both. When the repast was fully discussed, the lion put his hands in his waistband again, and lay down to meditate. The jackal then invigorated himself with a bumper for his throttle, and a fresh application to his head, and applied himself to the collection of a second meal; this was administered to the lion in the same manner, and was not disposed of until the clocks struck three in the morning.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后，豺狗终于给狮子准备好了一份结结实实的点心。狮子小心翼翼地接过手来，再从其中挑挑拣拣，发表意见，然后豺狗又来帮忙。这份点心充分消化之后，狮子又把双手塞进腰带，躺了下来，陷入沉思。于是豺狗又灌下—大杯酒，提了提神，润了润喉，再在头上搭一个冷敷，开始准备第二道点心。这道点心也以同样方式给狮子送上，直到钟敲凌晨三点才算消化完毕。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When his host followed him out on the staircase with a candle, to light him down the stairs, the day was coldly looking in through its grimy windows. When he got out of the house, the air was cold and sad, the dull sky overcast, the river dark and dim, the whole scene like a lifeless desert. And wreaths of dust were spinning round and round before the morning blast, as if the desert-sand had risen far away, and the first spray of it in its advance had begun to overwhelm the city.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的主人秉烛送他来到台阶上、照着他走下去时，白日已从肮脏的窗户上冷冷地望了进来。卡尔顿来到了屋外，屋外的空气寒冷而凄凉，天空阴云爱逮，河水幽黯模糊，整个场景像一片没有生命的荒漠。晨风吹得一圈圈尘埃旋卷翻滚，仿佛荒漠的黄沙已在远处冲天而起，其先驱已开始袭击城市，要把它埋掉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Waste forces within him, and a desert all around, this man stood still on his way across a silent terrace, and saw for a moment, lying in the wilderness before him, a mirage of honourable ambition, self-denial, and perseverance. In the fair city of this vision, there were airy galleries from which the loves and graces looked upon him, gardens in which the fruits of life hung ripening, waters of Hope that sparkled in his sight. A moment, and it was gone. Climbing to a high chamber in a well of houses, he threw himself down in his clothes on a neglected bed, and its pillow was wet with wasted tears.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="内心有种种废弃的力量，周围是一片荒漠，这个人跨下一步沉寂的台阶，却站定了。瞬息之间他在眼前的荒野里看到了一座由荣耀的壮志、自我克制以及坚毅顽强组成的海市蜃楼。在那美丽的幻影城市里有虚无缥缈的长廊，长廊里爱之神和美之神遥望着他；有悬满了成熟的生命之果的花园；有在他眼中闪着粼粼波光的希望之湖。可这一切转瞬之间却都消失了。他在层层叠叠的屋宇之巅爬到了一间高处的居室，衣服也不脱便扑倒在一张没有收拾过的床上，枕头上空流的眼泪点点斑斑，还是潮的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sadly, sadly, the sun rose; it rose upon no sadder sight than the man of good abilities and good emotions, incapable of their directed exercise, incapable of his own help and his own happiness, sensible of the blight on him, and resigning himself to let it eat him away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="太阳凄凉地、忧伤地升了起来，照在一个极可悲的人身上。那是个很有才华、感情深厚的人，却无法施展自己的才能，用那才华和情感为自己获取幸福。他明知道它的危害，却听之任之，让自己消磨憔悴。">查看中文翻译</div>
