<div class="line_en">"I'm so sorry," Rasheed said to the girl, taking his bowl of mastawa and meatballs from Mariam without looking at her. "I know you were very close… friends… the two of you. Always together, since you were kids. It's a terrible thing, what's happened. Too many young Afghan men are dying this way."</div>

<div class="line_en">Now he ate with a spoon. Used a napkin. Said lotfan when asking for water. And talked. Spiritedly and incessantly.</div>

<div class="line_en">"If you ask me, the Americans armed the wrong man in Hekmatyar. All the guns the CIA handed him in the eighties to fight the Soviets. The Soviets are gone, but he still has the guns, and now he's turning them on innocent people like your parents. And he calls this jihad. What a farce! What does jihad have to do with killing women and children? Better the CIA had armed Commander Massoud."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“照我说啊，美国把枪给古勒卜丁是给错人了。中央情报局在八十年代给了他很多枪，支持他抗击苏联人。苏联人走了，但枪还在他手里啊，现在他把枪口对准一些像你父母这样的无辜百姓。他还说这是圣战呢。太讽刺了！杀害妇女儿童跟圣战有什么关系呢？要是中央情报局当年扶植的是马苏德将军就好了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He motioned impatiently with his hand, still looking at the girl, and Mariam passed him a napkin.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他不耐烦地抬了一下手，眼睛依然望向女孩，玛丽雅姆递给他一块餐巾。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For years, Mariam had looked on as he ate, the muscles of his temples churning, one hand making compact little rice balls, the back of the other wiping grease, swiping stray grains, from the corners of his mouth. For years, he had eaten without looking up, without speaking, his silence condemning, as though some judgment were being passed, then broken only by an accusatory grunt, a disapproving cluck of his tongue, a one-word command for more bread, more water.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这么多年来，他吃饭的时候，玛丽雅姆一直在旁边看着；他使劲地咀嚼着，太阳穴一起一伏，一只手把米饭捏成小饭团，用另外一只手的手背去擦掉嘴角的油脂和粘在上面的饭粒。这么多年来，他吃饭的时候从不抬头，从不说话；吃完之后，他会沉默地板着脸，仿佛正要作出什么审判；接着会责备地哼一声，要么是不满地啪嗒一下舌头，或者用一个字索取更多的面包、更多的水。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="玛丽雅姆情不自禁地扬了扬眉毛。马苏德将军？在她的脑海中，她能听见拉希德对马苏德破口大骂，指责他是卖国贼。但话说回来，马苏德是个塔吉克人，当然了。和莱拉一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Not that they give a damn in America, mind you. What do they care that Pashtuns and Hazaras and Tajiks and Uzbeks are killing each other? How many Americans can even tell one from the other? Don't expect help from them, I say. Now that the Soviets have collapsed, we're no use to them. We served our purpose. To them, Afghanistan is a kenarab, a shit hole. Excuse my language, but it's true. What do you think, Laila jan?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可是在美国没有人在意这些，我跟你说。他们怎么会在乎普什图人、哈扎拉人、塔吉克人和乌兹别克人正在自相残杀呢？有多少美国人能够区分这几个种族呢？照我说，指望能得到他们的帮助是没戏了。现在苏联解体了，我们对他们来说没有用了。我们只能自生自灭。对他们来说，阿富汗是一个粪坑。请原谅我说粗话，但事实就是这样。你觉得呢，亲爱的莱拉？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Rasheed had to be sixty or more now -- though Mariam, and in fact Rasheed himself did not know his exact age. His hair had gone white, but it was as thick and coarse as ever. There was a sag now to his eyelids and the skin of his neck, which was wrinkled and leathery. His cheeks hung a bit more than they used to. In the mornings, he stooped just a tad. But he still had the stout shoulders, the thick torso, the strong hands, the swollen belly that entered the room before any other part of him did.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="拉希德今年至少六十岁了吧——玛丽雅姆心想，实际上，拉希德也不知道自己的确切年纪。他的头发已经灰白，但依然和过去一样粗硬。他的眼睑下垂，脖子长满皱纹，皮肤粗糙，也有点下垂。他的脸颊比过去更松弛了一些。每天早上，他的背会稍微有点驼。但他依然有着宽厚的肩膀，粗壮的身体，强劲有力的双手，和一个比他身体的其他任何部位先进入房间的隆起腹部。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On the whole, Mariam thought that he had weathered the years considerably better than she.</div>

<div class="line_en">"We need to legitimize this situation," he said now, balancing the ashtray on his belly. His lips scrunched up in a playful pucker. "People will talk. It looks dishonorable, an unmarried young woman living here. It's bad for my reputation. And hers. And yours, I might add."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们需要让这种情况变得合法。”这时他说，把烟灰缸摆在他的肚子上。他嘟起嘴唇，做出一个可笑的亲吻状。“人们会说三道四的。一个未婚的少女住在这里可不是什么光彩的事情。这将会败坏我的名声。她的名声。我想还可以加上你的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
