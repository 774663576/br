<div class="line_en">Negro laborers, grisly with a white coating of cement, sloped down past the shop on their way home. The draymen dispersed slowly, a slouchy policeman loafed down the steps of the city hall picking his teeth, and on the market side, from high grilled windows, there came the occasional howls of a drunken negress. Life buzzed slowly like a fly.</div>

<div class="line_en">The indolence of age and disintegration was creeping over him. He now rose a full hour late, he came to his shop punctually, but he spent long hours of the day extended on the worn leather couch of his office, or in gossip with Jannadeau, bawdy old Liddell, Cardiac, and Fagg Sluder, who had salted away his fortune in two big buildings on the Square and was at the present moment tilted comfortably in a chair before the fire department, gossiping eagerly with members of the ball club, whose chief support he was. It was after five o'clock, the game was over.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="由于上了年纪，甘特慢慢地也没有以前那么勤劳了。现在他起床的时间也比以往整整晚一个小时，但是去店铺上班历来都很准时。他一到铺子里，要么花大部分时间躺在那张长沙发上，要么就和简那度聊天。一起闲谈的还有老色鬼李德尔、卡迪亚、法格·斯路德。斯路德是个有钱人，他投资建设了小城中心的两座大楼。这时候他正跷着腿，舒舒服服地坐在消防局门前的椅子里，兴高采烈地和当地棒球俱乐部的球员们闲聊着什么。时间已经过了五点，当天的球赛也已经结束了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One afternoon in the young summer, Gant leaned upon the rail, talking to Jannadeau. He was getting on to sixty-five, his erect body had settled, he stooped a little. He spoke of old age often, and he wept in his tirades now because of his stiffened hand. Soaked in pity, he referred to himself as "the poor old cripple who has to provide for them all."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="初夏的一个下午，甘特背靠在栏杆上和简那度一起聊天。他年近65了，腰板僵硬，有点儿驼背。他常说自己已经老了，而且常常因为自己不听使唤的手而大发感慨，甚至还会为之落泪。他自怨自怜，说自己是个“可怜的老残废，还得挣钱养活一大家子人”。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Across the Square, at its other edge, the young virgins of the eastern part of town walked lightly home in chattering groups. They came to town at four o'clock in the afternoon, walked up and down the little avenue several times, entered a shop to purchase small justifications, and finally went into the chief drugstore, where the bucks of the town loafed and drawled in lazy alert groups. It was their club, their brasserie, the forum of the sexes. With confident smiles the young men detached themselves from their group and strolled back to booth and table.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在广场的对面，从小城东部来的姑娘们三五成群，七嘴八舌地说笑着，轻松地向家里走去。她们是在下午四点钟来到城里的，已经在街上来回逛上好几趟，进店买了几样小东西，然后走进了小城一家很大的杂货店。这里是小伙子们的聚集地，他们三五成群地在这里闲逛、懒洋洋地聊着天，眼睛警惕地到处乱瞅。这里是他们的俱乐部，他们的啤酒馆，也是男女交流的好场所。这些年轻人脸上都带着微笑，渐渐脱离了谈话的群体，漫步来到小亭边，坐在酒桌前。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The sun had reddened slightly, there was a cool flowing breath from the hills, a freshening relaxation over the tired earth, the hope, the ecstasy of evening in the air. In slow pulses the thick plume of fountain rose, fell upon itself, and slapped the pool in lazy rhythms. A wagon rattled leanly over the big cobbles; beyond the firemen, the grocer Bradley wound up his awning with slow creaking revolutions.</div>

<div class="line_en">She regarded him with a shy pleased smile, and touched a coil of her fine hair with a small competent hand. He looked at her attentively, noting with pleasure her firm uncorseted hips, moulded compactly into her tailored suit, and her cocked comely legs tapering to graceful feet, shod in neat little slippers of tan. She was firm, strong, washed, and elegant -- a faint scent of lilac hovered over her: he looked at her candid eyes, lucently gray, and saw that she was quite a great lady.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她含羞而得意地冲甘特笑了笑，用她能干的纤手轻拢了一下秀发。他仔细地打量着她，看着她结实、丰满的屁股，看着她无须穿紧身衣就能显出的苗条身段，看着她跷起的修长秀腿，看着她动人的双足蹬着玲珑的棕色便鞋——她看上去结实、强壮、干净、优雅——浑身散发出淡淡的丁香味。他盯着她那双诚挚的眼睛，水汪汪的，显得明亮而沉稳。他知道眼前的这位女性的确很了不起。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They had always known each other -- since first they met. They had no excuses, no questions, no replies. The world fell away from them. In the silence they heard the pulsing slap of the fountain, the high laughter of bawdry in the Square. He took a book of models from the desk, and began to turn its slick pages. They showed modest blocks of Georgia marble and Vermont granite.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们两人一向可谓彼此相知——自他们初次见面起就是这样。他们之间的关系，无须什么辩解，无须提问，也无须回答。他们两人在一起的时候，世界好像游离于他们之外。寂静中，他们听见喷泉的溅落声和广场上开怀的大笑声。他从书桌上拿起一本墓碑样簿，一页一页地翻着，上面的图片都是佐治亚普通大理石和佛蒙特花岗石的墓碑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">His face was shocked and unwilling. He gnawed the corner of his thin lip. No one knew how fond he was of the angel. Publicly he called it his White Elephant. He cursed it and said he had been a fool to order it. For six years it had stood on the porch, weathering, in all the wind and the rain. It was now brown and fly-specked. But it had come from Carrara in Italy, and it held a stone lily delicately in one hand. The other hand was lifted in benediction, it was poised clumsily upon the ball of one phthisic foot, and its stupid white face wore a smile of soft stone idiocy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的脸上马上露出震惊且不太情愿的神色。他咬起薄薄的嘴唇。没有人清楚他在心里多么喜欢那尊天使。在众人面前，他经常说这尊天使简直就是个大累赘，并且后悔自己当初不该订购它。在过去的六年里，那尊天使一直搁在门廊里，饱经了风雨的侵蚀。现在它的表面已经变成了黄褐色，上面布满了斑斑污渍。这尊天使产自意大利的卡拉拉。她一手拿着一朵石制的百合花，另一只手向上抬起做出祈福状，身体笨拙地站在一只踮起的石脚上，柔和的脸上挂着凝固不变的微笑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In his rages, Gant sometimes directed vast climaxes of abuse at the angel. "Fiend out of Hell!" he roared. "You have impoverished me, you have ruined me, you have cursed my declining years, and now you will crush me to death, fearful, awful, and unnatural monster that you are."</div>

<div class="line_en">The moon stood already, like its own phantom, in the clear washed skies of evening. A little boy with an empty paper-delivery bag swung lithely by, his freckled nostrils dilating pleasantly with hunger and the fancied smell of supper. He passed, and for a moment, as they stood at the porch edge, all life seemed frozen in a picture: the firemen and Fagg Sluder had seen Gant, whispered, and were now looking toward him; a policeman, at the high side-porch of the Police Court, leaned on the rail and stared; at the near edge of the central grass-plot below the fountain, a farmer bent for water at a bubbling jet, rose dripping, and stared; from the Tax Collector's office, City Hall, upstairs, Yancey, huge, meaty, shirtsleeved, stared. And in that second the slow pulse of the fountain was suspended, life was held, like an arrested gesture, in photographic abeyance, and Gant felt himself alone move deathward in a world of seemings as, in 1910, a man might find himself again in a picture taken on the grounds of the Chicago Fair, when he was thirty and his mustache black, and, noting the bustled ladies and the derbied men fixed in the second's pullulation, remember the dead instant, seek beyond the borders for what was there (he knew); or as a veteran who finds himself upon his elbow near Ulysses Grant, before the march, in pictures of the Civil War, and sees a dead man on a horse; or I should say, like some completed Don, who finds himself again before a tent in Scotland in his youth, and notes a cricket-bat long lost and long forgotten, the face of a poet who has died, and young men and the tutor as they looked that Long Vacation when they read nine hours a day for "Greats."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="皓月已升到夜晚晴朗的高空，好像自己的幻影挂在那里。一个小报童挎着空空的报纸袋子，踩着轻快的脚步从他们身边走了过去。他满是雀斑的鼻子似乎已经嗅着了晚饭的香味，并且满怀期待。他们站在门廊旁边，孩子走了过去。这一刻整个生活似乎凝结成了一幅画面。消防队员和法格·斯路德早就看见了甘特。两个人低语了几声，然后朝他这边张望着。一个警察靠在警署前的凉台栏杆边，居高临下地眺望着。在喷泉下面的中央草坪旁边，一个农夫正弯下腰凑到喷嘴前喝水，喝完后又站直身子，手上、脸上湿漉漉的，他张眼四望。在市政厅楼上税务局的办公室里，身高体胖的杨赛穿着短衫，也在瞪眼张望着什么。仿佛在这一刻，喷泉富有节奏的喷水也停了下来，生活开始静止不动了，就像照片里凝固的姿势。在这个世界里，甘特觉得自己正一个人朝死亡走去。正如在1910年，有人可能会看到自己30岁时在芝加哥博览会上拍的一张照片，照片上的他留着黑黑的小胡子，女士们全都穿着当年流行的后边翘得高高的裙子，男士们都戴着黑色的圆礼帽，全都凝固在那一刻的忙碌和喧嚣中。他铭记着那个逝去的瞬间，竭力搜寻着照片以外的事（他都知道）；要么就像一幅南北战争的图画，他是一位老兵，正匍匐在尤里西斯·甘特的身边，正要打算朝前冲去，却看到了前面马背上的死者；要不然，也可以说，就像英国大学的教师，忽然又看到了自己小时候在苏格兰露营的帐篷，想起了早已遗失、忘却了的板球拍，想起某位已经去世多年的诗人，想起年轻的学生和老师在大学的暑假每天研读9个小时的“经典著作”。">查看中文翻译</div>
