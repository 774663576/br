<div class="line_en">Mrs. Hallorann's third son, Dick, dressed in his cook's whites, a Lucky Strike parked in the corner of his mouth, backed his reclaimed Cadillac limo out of its space behind the One -- A Wholesale Vegetable Mart and drove slowly around the building. Masterton, part owner now but still walking with the patented shuffle he had adopted back before World War II, was pushing a bin of lettuces into the high, dark building.</div>

<div class="line_en">Hallorann stopped in the turn lane at the Vermont Street light, and when the green arrow showed he pulled out onto state highway 219, pushing up to forty and holding it there until the town began to trickle away into an exurban sprawl of gas stations, Burger Kings, and McDonalds. It was a small order today, he could have sent Baedecker after it, but Baedecker had been chafing for his chance to buy the meat, and besides, Hallorann never missed a chance to bang it back and forth with Frank Masterton if he could help it. Masterton might show up tonight to watch some TV and drink Hallorann's Bushmill's, or he might not. Either way was all right. But seeing him mattered. Every time it mattered now, because they weren't young anymore. In the last few days it seemed he was thinking of that very fact a great deal. Not so young anymore, when you got up near sixty years old (or tell the truth and save a lie -- past it) you had to start thinking about stepping out. You could go anytime. And that had been on his mind this week, not in a heavy way but as a fact. Dying was a part of living. You had to keep tuning in to that if you expected to be a whole person. And if the fact of your own death was hard to understand, at least it wasn't impossible to accept.</div>

<div class="line_en">Why this should have been on his mind he could not have said, but his other reason for getting this small order himself was so he could step upstairs to the small office over Frank's Bar and Grill. There was a lawyer up there now (the dentist who had been there last year had apparently gone broke), a young black fellow named McIver. Hallorann had stepped in and told this McIver that he wanted to make a will, and could McIver help him out? Well, McIver asked, how soon do you want the document? Yesterday, said Hallorann, and threw his head back and laughed. Have you got anything complicated in mind? was McIver's next question. Hallorann did not. He had his Cadillac, his bank account -- some nine thousand dollars -- a piddling checking account, and a closet of clothes. He wanted it all to go to his sister. And if your sister predeceases you? McIver asked. Never mind, Hallorann said. If that happens, I'll make a new will. The document had been completed and signed in less than three hours -- fast work for a shyster -- and now resided in Hallorann's breast pocket, folded into a stiff blue envelope with the word WILL on the outside in Old English letters.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他也许说不出自己为什么会想到这些，但他亲自来采购这不多的东西还有另外一个原因：这样，他就可以到弗兰克酒吧烤肉店楼上的那个小小的办公室去。现在那上面住着一位律师（去年住在那里的牙医显然已经破产了），是个名叫麦克伊夫的黑人小伙子。哈洛伦走进去告诉麦克伊夫他想立一份遗嘱，麦克伊夫能帮他这个忙吗？对了，麦克伊夫问，你想最早什么时候要？昨天，哈洛伦说，然后仰头大笑起来。你有什么特别的考虑吗？麦克伊夫又问。没有。他有一辆凯迪拉克，一张存折——约九千美元，一柜子衣服。他想把这些都留给他妹妹。如果你妹妹先你而去呢？麦克伊夫问。不要紧，哈洛伦说。那样的话，我会再立一份新遗嘱。这份文件不到三个小时就准备好了，签了字——对一个讼棍来说够快了——现在，遗嘱就在哈洛伦胸前的口袋里的一个蓝色的硬纸信封里，信封上用古英语字母写着“遗嘱”。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The limo had just drawn even with a Pinto station wagon driven by a man in workman's clothes. The workman saw the limo drifting into his lane and laid on the born. When the Cadillac continued to drift he snapped a look at the driver and saw a big black man bolt upright behind the wheel, his eyes looking vaguely upward. Later the workman told his wife that he knew it was just one of those niggery hairdos they were all wearing these days, but at the time it had looked just as if every hair on that coon's head was standing on end.

No mountain, but he had reached a sunny plateau after years of struggle. He had good friends. He had all the references he would ever need to get a job anywhere.

<div class="line_en">The maid was an olive-complected girl of twenty-three who waited table near the end of the season when things slowed down. She had a small shining, Hallorann judged, really not more than a twinkle; a mousy-looking man and his escort, wearing a faded cloth coat, would come in for dinner and Delores would trade one of her tables for theirs. The mousy little man would leave a picture of Alexander Hamilton under his plate, had enough for the girl who had made the trade, but worse, Delores would crow over it. She was lazy, a goof-off in an operation run by a man who allowed no goof-offs. She would sit in a linen closet, reading a confession magazine and smoking, but whenever Ullman went on one of his unscheduled prowls (and woe to the girl he caught resting her feet) he found her working industriously, her magazine hidden under the sheets on a high shelf, her ashtray tucked safely into her uniform pocket. Yeah, Hallorann thought, she'd been a goof-off and a sloven and the other girls had resented her, but Delores had had that little twinkle. It had always greased the skids for her. But what she had seen in 217 had scared her badly enough so she was more than glad to pick up the walking papers Ullman had issued her and go.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="德洛尔丝是个23岁的橄榄色皮肤的姑娘，每当旺季临近结束、事情少起来的时候，她便陪客人用餐。她也有点小小的闪灵，哈洛伦断定，确实只是一星半点。比如说，有一次，一个鼠眉鼠眼的男人和他的陪同，穿着褪了色的布外套，要进来用餐，而德洛尔丝则把他们用的那张桌子换给别人伺候。那个猥琐的家伙在盘子底下涂抹了一张亚历山大·汉弥尔顿的图画，做这个交换的女孩只好自认倒霉，更糟的是，德洛尔丝还对此颇感得意。她很懒惰，是个游手好闲的女人，而她所在的饭店却是由一个不允许她这样的人存在的家伙管理着。她经常藏在被服间里看杂志、抽烟，但无论厄尔曼什么时候进行非常规巡视（如果他发现谁在歇歇脚，那她就该吃吃苦头了），他都发现她在勤奋地工作。她的杂志藏在高架子上的床单下面，烟灰缸万无一失地塞在她的制服口袋里。是的，哈洛伦想，她是个懒虫，别的女孩子都恨她，但她有那么一点灵光，这帮了她不少忙。但她在217房间看到的东西着实把她吓坏了，所以，厄尔曼把她打发走是她求之不得的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The maid, Delores Vickery her name was, had been hysterical. Had said some things to the other chambermaids, and worse still, to some of the guests. When the word got back to Ullman, as the silly quiff should have known it would do, he had fired her out of hand. She had come to Hallorann in tears, not about being fired, but about the thing she had seen in that second-floor room. She had gone into 217 to change the towels, she said, and there had been that Mrs. Massey, lying dead in the tub. That, of course, was impossible. Mrs. Massey had been discreetly taken away the day before and was even then winging her way back to New York-in the shipping hold instead of the first class she'd been accustomed to.</div>

<div class="line_en">That dog would seem to change from his sitting-up posture to a slightly crouched one, and the lions seemed to move forward, as if menacing the little tykes on the playground. Last year in May Ullman had sent him up to the attic to look for the ornate set of firetools that now stood beside the lobby fireplace. While he had been up there the three lightbulbs strung overhead had gone out and he had lost his way back to the trapdoor. He had stumbled around for an unknown length of time, closer and closer to panic, barking his shins on boxes and bumping into things, with a stronger and stronger feeling that something was stalking him in the dark. Some great and frightening creature that had just oozed out of the woodwork when the lights went out. And when he had literally stumbled over the trapdoor's ringbolt he had hurried down as fast as he could, leaving the trap open, sooty and disheveled, with a feeling of disaster barely averted. Later Ullman had come down to the kitchen personally, to inform him he had left the attic trapdoor open and the lights burning up there.

<div class="line_en">And he suspected -- no, was nearly positive -- that several of the guests had seen or heard things too. In the three years he had been there, the Presidential Suite had been booked nineteen times. Six of the guests who had put up there had left the hotel early, some of them looking markedly ill. Other guests had left other rooms with the same abruptness. One night in August of 1974, near dusk, a man who had won the Bronze and Silver Stars in Korea (that man now sat on the boards of three major corporations and was said to have personally pink-slipped a famous TV news anchorman) unaccountably went into a fit of screaming hysterics on the putting green. And there had been dozens of children during Hallorann's association with the Overlook who simply refused to go into the playground. One child had had a convulsion while playing in the concrete rings, but Hallorann didn't know if that could be attributed to the Overlook's deadly siren song or not-word had gone around among the help that the child, the only daughter of a handsome movie actor, was a medically controlled epileptic who had simply forgotten her medicine that day.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他怀疑——不，他几乎敢肯定——有些客人也看到或听到了什么东西。他在那里呆的三年里，总统套间被预订过19次。住进去的六位客人提前离开了饭店，其中有几个显然病了。住在其他客房里的有些客人也匆匆走了。1974年8月的一个下午，黄昏时分，一个在朝鲜获得过铜星勋章和银星勋章的男人（那人现在是三家大公司的董事会成员，据称他私下解雇了一位著名的电视新闻广播员）在草坪上无缘无故地歇斯底里起来。哈洛伦受雇远望饭店期间，有许多孩子无论如何都不进游乐场。有个孩子在混凝上管里玩的时候发生了惊厥，但哈洛伦不知道那是否应归咎于远望饭店那要命的塞壬之歌——雇员们中盛传那个孩子（一位英俊潇洒的电影演员的独生女）是个药物控制的癫痫病患者，那天她只不过忘了吃药。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And so, staring down at the corpse of Mrs. Massey, he had been frightened but not completely terrified. It was not completely unexpected. Terror came when she opened her eyes to disclose blank silver pupils and began to grin at him. Horror came when (she had started to get out and come after him.) He had fled, heart racing, and had not felt safe even with the door shut and locked behind him. In fact, he admitted to himself now as he zipped the flightbag shut, he had never felt safe anywhere in the Overlook again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因此，盯着梅西夫人的尸体，他确实被吓了一跳，但并没有被吓懵。这并非完全出人意外。真正吓人的是她睁开了眼睛，露出了银白色的眼珠子，还对他咧嘴笑起来。接着，令人毛发直竖的事发生了——（她从浴缸里爬出来，在他后面追上来了。）他拔腿就跑，心脏狂跳着，甚至在关上门、锁上门之后他还感到不安全。实际上，此时，他拉上飞行包的拉链的时候，他暗自承认，从那以后他在远望饭店再也没感到安全过。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He looked at his watch. It was 5:30 P. m. He went to the apartment's door, remembered it would be heavy winter now in Colorado, especially up in the mountains, and went back to his closet. He pulled his long, sheepskin-lined overcoat out of its polyurethane dry-cleaning bag and put it over his arm. It was the only winter garment he owned. He turned off all the lights and looked around. Had he forgotten anything? Yes. One thing. He took the will out of his breast pocket and slipped it into the margin of the dressing table mirror. With luck he would be back to get it.</div>
