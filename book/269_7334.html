<div class="line_en">The current wouldn't let up. It was slamming me against more rocks; they beat against the center of my back sharply, rhythmically, pushing the water from my lungs. It gushed out in amazing volume, absolute torrents pouring from my mouth and nose. The salt burned and my lungs burned and my throat was too full of water to catch a breath and the rocks were hurting my back. Somehow I stayed in one place, though the waves still heaved around me. I couldn't see anything but water everywhere, reaching for my face.</div>

<div class="line_en">The water licked and writhed up the sand after us as Jacob carried me away, like it was angry that I'd escaped. As I stared wearily, a spark of color caught my unfocused eyes -- a small flash of fire was dancing on the black water, far out in the bay. The image made no sense, and I wondered how conscious I really was. My head swirled with the memory of the black, churning water -- of being so lost that I couldn't find up or down. So lost… but somehow Jacob…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="雅各布抱着我离开，海水卷起了我们身后的沙石，似乎因为我的逃脱而怒气冲冲。我疲乏地盯着海面，一点亮色吸引了我游离的目光——在海湾深处，黑色的海水之上跳跃着一团红色的火焰。这个景象简直不合常理，我怀疑自己仍处在神志不清的状态。我的脑海里想的尽是漆黑、翻滚的海水——还是那个迷失方向、不分上下的我，我迷失在深海中但是，雅各布却能……">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Let's get you out of here, then," Jacob said. He slid his arms under me and lifted me without effort -- like picking up an empty box.

<div class="line_cn" title="“我们带你离开里？”雅各布说道。他把胳膊伸到我背下，轻轻地将我抱了起来——就像抬起一个空箱子。他赤着的胸膛十分温暖；他耸着肩，为我挡住雨水。我没精打采地将头倚靠在他的手臂上，茫然地盯着汹涌的海水，看着海水冲击他身后的沙滩。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I followed the tire tracks to your truck, and then I heard you scream…" He shuddered. "Why would you jump, Bella? Didn't you notice that it's turning into a hurricane out here? Couldn't you have waited for me?" Anger filled his tone as the relief faded.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“对不起，”我小声说道，“我太蠢了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“对，确实蠢。”他点点头赞同道，头发上的雨水滴落下来，“你能不能等我在你身边的时候再做这些蠢事？如果知道你会背着我跳悬崖，我根本没法集中精神干自己的事情。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Sure," I agreed. "No problem." I sounded like a chain-smoker. I tried to clear my throat -- and then winced; the throat-clearing felt like stabbing a knife down there.

<div class="line_cn" title="“当然，”我满口答应，“没问题。听上去我就像一个嗓音沙哑的烟鬼，我清了清嗓子——立马露出痛苦的表情，似乎有把匕首插入了喉咙，“今天发生了什么事？你们找到她了吗？”尽管紧挨着他温暖的身体，我并不觉得太冷，但一提到这件事，我还是忍不住打了个寒噤。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jacob shook his head. He was still more running than walking as he headed up the road to his house. "No. She took off into the water -- the bloodsuckers have the advantage there.

<div class="line_cn" title="雅各布摇了摇头。我们到了大路上，他仍然朝着他家慢跑。“没有，她逃到海里了——吸血鬼在水里比较有优势。这是我赶回来的原因——我担心她会游上岸，而你总是待在海滩边”他的声音越来越小，喉咙有些哽咽。">查看中文翻译</div>
