<div class="line_en">And if Rose liked, she said, while Jasper took the message, she might choose which jewels she was to wear. When there are fifteen people sitting down to dinner, one cannot keep things waiting for ever. She was now beginning to feel annoyed with them for being so late; it was inconsiderate of them, and it annoyed her on top of her anxiety about them, that they should choose this very night to be out late, when, in fact, she wished the dinner to be particularly nice, since William Bankes had at last consented to dine with them; and they were having Mildred's masterpiece -- BOEUF EN DAUBE. Everything depended upon things being served up to the precise moment they were ready. The beef, the bayleaf, and the wine -- all must be done to a turn. To keep it waiting was out of the question. Yet of course tonight, of all nights, out they went, and they came in late, and things had to be sent out, things had to be kept hot; the BOEUF EN DAUBE would be entirely spoilt.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes," said Prue, in her considering way, answering her mother's question, "I think Nancy did go with them."</div>

<div class="line_en">Well then, Nancy had gone with them, Mrs Ramsay supposed, wondering, as she put down a brush, took up a comb, and said "Come in" to a tap at the door (Jasper and Rose came in), whether the fact that Nancy was with them made it less likely or more likely that anything would happen; it made it less likely, somehow, Mrs Ramsay felt, very irrationally, except that after all holocaust on such a scale was not probable. They could not all be drowned. And again she felt alone in the presence of her old antagonist, life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如此说来，南希和他们一起去了，拉姆齐夫人想道。她放下发刷，拿起梳子，听见敲门声，说“进来”（贾斯珀和萝丝走了进来），一面心里在琢磨，究竟南希和他们在一起会使出事的可能性更大些还是更小些；不知为什么，拉姆齐夫人觉得可能性会更小些，她这样想没有什么道理，只是认为如此规模的惨案毕竟不太可能，他们不可能全都淹死。她又一次感到自己在老对手——生活——面前是多么孤立无助。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jasper offered her an opal necklace; Rose a gold necklace. Which looked best against her black dress? Which did indeed, said Mrs Ramsay absent-mindedly, looking at her neck and shoulders (but avoiding her face) in the glass. And then, while the children rummaged among her things, she looked out of the window at a sight which always amused her -- the rooks trying to decide which tree to settle on. Every time, they seemed to change their minds and rose up into the air again, because, she thought, the old rook, the father rook, old Joseph was her name for him, was a bird of a very trying and difficult disposition. He was a disreputable old bird, with half his wing feathers missing. He was like some seedy old gentleman in a top hat she had seen playing the horn in front of a public house.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="贾斯珀给她挑了一条蛋白石项链；给萝丝挑的是金项链。配她的黑色礼服，哪一条更好看？究竟哪条好看？拉姆齐夫人看着镜子里自己的脖子和肩膀（但避免看脸部），心不在焉地说。孩子们在乱翻她的首饰的时候，她看着窗外那总是让她感到十分有趣的景象——那些白嘴鸦盘旋着想决定往哪棵树上落。每一次它们都似乎改变主意，重又飞向天空，她想，这是因为那只老白嘴鸦，她叫它老约瑟夫的那只鸦爸爸，是只脾气刁钻古怪的乌。它是只很不体面的老鸟，翅膀上的毛掉了一半。像她看见过的那个在一家酒吧前吹喇叭的戴顶大礼帽的破落老绅士。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Look!" she said, laughing. They were actually fighting. Joseph and Mary were fighting. Anyhow they all went up again, and the air was shoved aside by their black wings and cut into exquisite out, out, out -- she could never describe it accurately enough to please herself -- was one of the loveliest of all to her. Look at that, she said to Rose, hoping that Rose would see it more clearly than she could. For one's children so often gave one's own perceptions a little thrust forwards.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“看呀！”她笑着说。它们还真在打架。约瑟夫和玛丽打起来了。反正它们又全都飞上天去了，它们的黑色翅膀推开空气，把空气切成优美的镰钩形。那翅膀扑扇、扑扇、扑扇的动作——她永远也无法淮确地形容得令自己满意——对她来说是最最可爱的。你看那个，她对萝丝说，希望萝丝能看得比自己清楚些。因为你的儿女常常会把你的感受往前推进一小点。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But she let them take their time to choose: she let Rose, particularly, take up this and then that, and hold her jewels against the black dress, for this little ceremony of choosing jewels, which was gone through every night, was what Rose liked best, she knew. She had some hidden reason of her own for attaching great importance to this choosing what her mother was to wear. What was the reason, Mrs Ramsay wondered, standing still to let her clasp the necklace she had chosen, divining, through her own past, some deep, some buried, some quite speechless feeling that one had for one's mother at Rose's age. Like all feelings felt for oneself, Mrs Ramsay thought, it made one sad. It was so inadequate, what one could give in return; and what Rose felt was quite out of proportion to anything she actually was. And Rose would grow up; and Rose would suffer, she supposed, with these deep feelings, and she said she was ready now, and they would go down, and Jasper, because he was the gentleman, should give her his arm, and Rose, as she was the lady, should carry her handkerchief (she gave her the handkerchief), and what else? oh, yes, it might be cold: a shawl. Choose me a shawl, she said, for that would please Rose, who was bound to suffer so. "There," she said, stopping by the window on the landing, "there they are again." Joseph had settled on another tree- top. "Don't you think they mind," she said to Jasper, "having their wings broken?" Why did he want to shoot poor old Joseph and Mary? He shuffled a little on the stairs, and felt rebuked, but not seriously, for she did not understand the fun of shooting birds; and they did not feel; and being his mother she lived away in another division of the world, but he rather liked her stories about Mary and Joseph. She made him laugh. But how did she know that those were Mary and Joseph? Did she think the same birds came to the same trees every night? he asked. But here, suddenly, like all grown-up people, she ceased to pay him the least attention. She was listening to a clatter in the hall. "They've come back!" she exclaimed, and at once she felt much more annoyed with them than relieved. Then she wondered, had it happened? She would go down and they would tell her -- but no.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是她由着他们慢慢挑：特别是尽着萝丝一会儿拿起这条、一会儿拿起那条，把首饰放在黑礼服前比试，因为她知道，每晚这小小的挑选首饰的仪典是萝丝最喜欢的。萝丝如此重视为母亲挑选要戴的首饰，有她自己秘密的原因。是什么原因呢，拉姆齐夫人一动不动地站在那里，让萝丝把选中的项链给她戴上，一面心里在想；她从自己的过去中推测，像萝丝这样年龄的女孩对母亲所怀有的某种深刻的、某种埋藏在心底的、难以用言语表达的感情。就像一切别人对自己的感情一样，拉姆齐夫人心里想，它使人黯然神伤；你能够给这种感情以回报的是太少了；而萝丝对她的感情和拉姆齐夫人的实际情况相比也太不相称了。萝丝会长大成人；带着这样深刻的感情，她认为，萝丝也将会感到痛苦；这时她说她已经准备停当，他们可以下楼去了，贾斯珀，因为他是位绅士，应该伸出于臂来让她挽着，而萝丝既然是位小姐，应该给她拿手绢（她把手绢给了她），还有什么？啊，对了，可能会冷：带上披巾吧。给我挑一条披巾，她说．因为这会让萝丝高兴的，这个孩子将来注定会痛苦的。“看那儿，”她在楼梯口的窗前停下脚步说，“它们又回来了。”约瑟夫落在了另一棵树梢上。“你不认为，”她对贾斯珀说，“它们不愿意翅膀被打断吗？”他为什么要用枪去打可怜的老约瑟夫和玛丽？他在楼梯上倒动着两只脚，觉得受到了责备．但是不算严厉。她不懂打鸟的乐趣；不知道它们没有感觉；作为他的母亲她生活在世界的另一个区域里，但他挺喜欢她讲的玛丽和约瑟夫的故事。她能使他大笑。可她怎么知道这两只鸟就是玛丽和约瑟夫呢？难道她认为每晚都是同样的鸟飞到同样的树上来吗？他问。但是这时像所有的大人一样，她突然不再注意到他。她正倾听着从门厅里传来的喧嚷声。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They could not tell her anything, with all these people about. So she must go down and begin dinner and wait. And, like some queen who, finding her people gathered in the hall, looks down upon them, and descends among them, and acknowledges their tributes silently, and accepts their devotion and their prostration before her (Paul did not move a muscle but looked straight before him as she passed) she went down, and crossed the hall and bowed her head very slightly, as if she accepted what they could not say: their tribute to her beauty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他们回来了！”她大声说道，顷刻之间对他们的气恼超过了感到的宽慰。然后她又想，这发生过吗？她可以走下去，而他们会告诉他——但是不。当着这么多人他们什么也不会告诉她的。因此她必须下楼去先开始晚餐，并耐心等待。像一个看到臣民聚集在大厅里的女王，她俯视着他们，然后下到他们之中，默默地对他们的赞美表示致意，接受他们对她的忠诚和膜拜（保罗在她经过时一动也不动，只是直视着前方），她走下楼来，穿过门厅，微微点了点头，仿佛在接受他们未能说出的话：对她美貌的赞美。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But she stopped. There was a smell of burning. Could they have let the BOEUF EN DAUBE overboil? she wondered, pray heaven not! when the great clangour of the gong announced solemnly, authoritatively, that all those scattered about, in attics, in bedrooms, on little perches of their own, reading, writing, putting the last smooth to their hair, or fastening dresses, must leave all that, and the little odds and ends on their washing-tables and dressing tables, and the novels on the bed- tables, and the diaries which were so private, and assemble in the dining-room for dinner.</div>
