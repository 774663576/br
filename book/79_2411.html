<div class="line_en">Danny awoke with a muffled gasp from a terrible dream. There had been an explosion. A fire. The Overlook was burning up. He and his mommy were watching it from the front lawn.</div>

<div class="line_en">That was when he woke up, his throat tight with fear, his hands clutching at the sheet and blankets. Had he screamed? He looked over at his mother. Wendy lay on her side, the blankets up to her chin, a sheaf of straw-colored hair lying against her cheek. She looked like a child herself. No, he hadn't screamed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="梦做到这里，他醒了过来，喉咙发紧，手里死命地抓着床单和毛毯。他发出尖叫了吗？他望了一眼妈妈。温迪侧身躺着，毛毯直盖到下巴，一绺稻草色的头发搭在面颊上，看上去也像个孩子。没有，他没有发出尖叫。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He looked at them and they were all dead. Their leaves had turned a suffocant brown. The tightly packed branches showed through like the skeletons of half- dismembered corpses. And then his daddy had burst out of the Overlooks big double doors, and he was burning like a torch. His clothes were in flames, his skin had acquired a dark and sinister tan that was growing darker by the moment, his hair was a burning bush.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="丹尼望过去，它们全死了，叶子变成了焦褐色，密密层层的枝条看上去像残缺不全的尸骨。这时，爸爸从饭店大门冲了出来，烧得像把火炬。他的衣服上火苗直窜，皮肤被燎成了可怕的焦黑色，而且颜色每时每刻都在加深，他的头发像一丛燃烧的灌木。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Lying in bed, looking upward, the nightmare began to drain away. He had a curious feeling that some great tragedy (fire? explosion?) had been averted by inches.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="躺在床上，眼睛望着上方，恶梦逐渐退去。他莫名其妙地感觉到：一场可怕的灾难（火灾？爆炸？）以毫厘之差幸免了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He recoiled in terror from that mental voice, his eyes widening, his hands tightening into claws on the counterpane. It hadn't been the voice of his father but a clever mimic. A voice he knew. Hoarse, brutal, yet underpointed with a vacuous sort of humor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他被这个内心深处的声音吓得缩成了一团，眼睛瞪得圆圆的，两只手紧紧地抓在床罩上。那不是爸爸的声音，但装得很像。他熟悉这个声音。沙哑，狂暴，但却潜藏着一种无意义的幽默。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the lobby. Danny pushed a little harder, trying to get inside his father. It was not good. Because Daddy was thinking about the Bad Thing.

<div class="line_en">The man's mouth and chin and cheeks were smeared with blood.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那人嘴巴、下巴和面颊上涂着血。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was a man on all fours halfway down the corridor, between him and the stairs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有个人四肢着地守在丹尼和楼梯之间的走廊上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The man looked up at him. His eyes were tiny and red. He was dressed in some sort of silvery, spangled costume. A dog costume, Danny realized. Protruding from the rump of this strange creation was a long and floppy tail with a puff on the end. A zipper ran up the back of the costume to the neck. To the left of him was a dog's or wolf's head, blank eyesockets above the muzzle, the mouth open in a meaningless snarl that showed the rug's black and blue pattern between fangs that appeared to be papier-mâché.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那人抬头看着他，绿豆大的眼睛红红的，身上套着缀满金属片的银光闪闪的戏装。那是一套狗戏装，丹尼认出来了。这个怪物的屁股上拖着一条长长的软尾巴，尾巴尖上有一团绒毛。戏装背上的拉链一直拉到了后颈窝。左边掉着一颗狗头或狼头，嘴巴上方有一对空空的眼窝，长嘴毫无意义地大张着，人造犬牙之间露出了地毯黑蓝两色的图案。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Danny froze.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="丹尼愣住了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He began to growl at Danny. He was grinning, but the growl was real. It was deep in his throat, a chilling primitive sound. Then he began to bark. His teeth were also stained red. He began to crawl toward Danny, dragging his boneless tail behind him. The costume dog's head lay unheeded on the carpet, glaring vacantly over Danny's shoulder.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他开始向丹尼嗥叫。他咧着嘴在笑，但那嗥叫是真的，发自喉咙深处，原始的声音，令人不寒而栗。接着他又汪汪吠叫起来，他的牙齿也染成了红色。他爬过来了，拖着那条没有骨头的尾巴。狗头孤零零地掉在地毯上，木然地瞪着丹尼肩膀上方。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Get it up!" the drunken dogman cried out from around the corner. His voice was both violent and despairing. "Get it up, Harry you bitch-bastard! I don't care how many casinos and airlines and movie companies you own! I know what you like in the privacy of your own h-home! Get it up! I'll huff… and I'll puff… until Harry Derwent's all bloowwwwn down!" He ended with a long, chilling howl that seemed to turn into a scream of rage and pain just before it dwindled off.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“起来！”醉醺醺的狗人在墙角那边嚷道，声音狂暴又绝望。“起来，哈里，你这个狗娘养的杂种！我不管你有多少赌场、航空公司、电影公司！我知道你的隐私！起来！我要鼓…我要吹…直到哈里·德文特的一切都完蛋！”最后他令人胆寒地发出一声长嗥，又逐渐变成了愤怒和痛苦的哀鸣。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Not by the hair of my chinny-chin-chin," the dogman replied. His small red eyes were fixed attentively on Danny's face. He continued to grin. "I'm going to eat you up, little boy. And I think I'll start with your plump little cock." He began to prance skittishly forward, making little leaps and snarling.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，”狗人回答道，发红的小眼睛死死地盯着丹尼，嘴巴仍然咧着。“小孩，我要把你吃掉。我想，就先从你那肥嘟嘟的小鸡鸡开始吧。”他蹦蹦跳跳地向前逼来，嗥叫着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Danny flinched back but didn't run. "Let me by."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="丹尼退了几步，但没逃跑。“让我过去。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm going to eat you, little boy," the dogman answered, and suddenly a fusillade of barks came from his grinning mouth. They were human imitations, but the savagery in them was real. The man's hair was dark, greased with sweat from his confining costume. There was a mixture of scotch and champagne on his breath.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我要吃你，小孩，”狗人回答道，接着，他咧开的嘴里突然发出了一连串吠叫，听得出是人的模仿，但其中的野性却是真的。戏装捂出的汗水打湿了他的黑发。他的气息中混和着苏格兰威士忌和香槟酒的气味。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Danny's nerve broke. He fled back into the short hallway that led to their quarters, looking back over his shoulder. There was a series of mixed howls and barks and growls, broken by slurred mutterings and giggles.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="丹尼的意志力崩溃了。他转身向通往他们房间的短过道逃去，不时地回头望一眼。一连串嚎叫、吠叫、狂叫混杂在一起，中间穿插着喁喁的说话声和咯咯咯的笑声。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他妈妈还在睡觉，一点没动，除了他谁也没听见这些。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He closed the door softly and went back up to the intersection of their corridor and the main hall, hoping the dogman would be gone, the way the blood on the walls of the Presidential Suite had been gone. He peeked around the corner carefully.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他轻轻地关上门，回到短过道与主走廊的接合处，希望狗人消失了，就像总统套间墙上的血迹不见了那样。他小心翼翼地往墙角那边窥探着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Danny went back to the bedroom and sat down on his cot, covering his eyes with his hands. The hotel was running things now. Maybe at first the things that had happened had only been accidents. Maybe at first the things he had seen really were like scary pictures that couldn't hurt him. But now the hotel was controlling those things and they could hurt. The Overlook hadn't wanted him to go to his father. That might spoil all the fun. So it had put the dogman in his way, just as it had put the hedge animals between them and the road.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="丹尼回到卧室，坐在小床上，用手蒙着眼睛。饭店已开始作怪了。也许以前发生的事只不过是偶然的，也许以前他看到的东西真的像不会伤害他的可怕的图画。但是现在，饭店开始操纵那些东西，它们能伤害他了。远望饭店不希望他去见他父亲，这可能会搅坏整个好事。因此，它让狗人挡在了他的路上，正如它曾让树篱动物挡在他们和公路之间一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Danny turned apprehensively to the closed bedroom door at the end of the hallway and walked quietly down to it. He opened it and poked his head through.</div>

<div class="line_en">They were going to die, all three of them, and when the Overlook opened next late spring, they would be right here to greet the guests along with the rest of the spooks.
