<div class="line_en">By the end of high school I'd become a mogul. My tuck-shop business had evolved into a mini-empire that included selling pirated CDs I made at home. I'd convinced my mother, as frugal as she was, that I needed a computer for school. I didn't. I wanted it so I could surf the Internet and play Leisure Suit Larry. But I was very convincing, and she broke down and got it for me. Thanks to the computer, the Internet, and the fortunate gift of a CD writer from a friend, I was in business.</div>

<div class="line_en">I had carved out my niche, and was having a great time; life was so good as an outsider that I didn't even think about dating. The only girls in my life were the naked ones on my computer. While I downloaded music and messed around in chat rooms, I'd dabble in porn sites here and there. No video, of course, only pictures. With online porn today you just drop straight into the madness, but with dial-up it took so long for the images to load. It was almost gentlemanly compared to now. You'd spend a good five minutes looking at her face, getting to know her as a person. Then a few minutes later you'd get some boobs. By the time you got to her vagina, you'd spent a lot of quality time together.</div>

<div class="line_en">In September of grade twelve, the matric dance was coming up. Senior prom. This was the big one. I was again faced with the dilemma of Valentine's Day, confronting another strange ritual I did not understand. All I knew about prom was that, according to my American movies, prom is where it happens. You lose your virginity. You go and you ride in the limousine, and then you and the girl do the thing. That was literally my only reference. But I knew the rule: Cool guys get girls, and funny guys get to hang out with the cool guys with their girls. So I'd assumed I wouldn't be going, or if I did go it wouldn't be with a date.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="十二年级那年的9月，会举办录取舞会，也就是高中的毕业舞会。这是件大事。我又遇上了和那次情人节一样的困境，又遇上了一个我并不理解的奇怪惯例。我对毕业舞会的全部了解是这样的：根据我看过的美国电影，毕业舞会就是要发生那件事的地方：你会失身。你要驾着豪华轿车去舞会，然后要和你的女伴做那件事。毫不夸张地说，这真的是我唯一的参考。但是我知道规则：帅哥才有女朋友，而搞笑的家伙则可以和帅哥以及他们的女朋友一起玩。所以我觉得我大概不会参加舞会了，因为哪怕我参加，身边也不会有女伴。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I had two middlemen working for me in my CD business, Bongani and Tom. They sold the CDs that I copied in exchange for a cut. I met Tom at the arcade at the Balfour Park mall. Like Teddy, he lived nearby because his mom was a domestic worker. Tom was in my grade but went to a government school, Northview, a proper ghetto school. Tom handled my CD sales over there.</div>

<div class="line_en">Tom was a chatterbox, hyperactive and go-go-go. He was a real hustler, too, always trying to cut a deal, work an angle. He could get people to do anything. A great guy, but fucking crazy and a complete liar as well. I went with him once to Hammanskraal, a settlement that was like a homeland, but not really. Hammanskraal, as its Afrikaans name suggests, was the kraal of Hamman, what used to be a white man's farm. The proper homelands, Venda and Gazankulu and Transkei, were places where black people actually lived, and the government drew a border around them and said, "Stay there." Hammanskraal and settlements like it were empty places on the map where deported black people had been relocated. That's what the government did. They would find some patch of arid, dusty, useless land, and dig row after row of holes in the ground -- a thousand latrines to serve four thousand families. Then they'd forcibly remove people from illegally occupying some white area and drop them off in the middle of nowhere with some pallets of plywood and corrugated iron. "Here. This is your new home. Build some houses. Good luck." We'd watch it on the news. It was like some heartless, survival-based reality TV show, only nobody won any money.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="汤姆是个话唠，特别好动，是一猛子向前冲的那种人。但他也是个绝对的骗子，总是想着怎么做个交易，绕个弯子。他能让别人去做任何事。他是个很棒的人，但同时又超级疯癫，也是一个彻头彻尾的骗人精。有一次我和他去哈曼斯克拉尔，那里是一处很像黑人家园的聚居区，但又与其他黑人家园不同。哈曼斯克拉尔是南非荷兰语，意思是哈曼的农场，这里曾是一个白人的农场。像文达、加赞库卢和特兰斯凯那样真正的黑人家园，都是以前黑人真正居住的地方，然后政府过来划了一条边界说：“你们就待在里面不要出来了。”但像哈曼斯克拉尔这样的地方，以前是地图上的空白区域，什么都没有，只是把黑人输送进来，让他们在这里安家。政府就是这么做的。他们会找那种荒芜贫瘠、尘土飞扬的无用之地，在地上挖出一排一排的洞——给四千户家庭准备的一千个公共厕所。接着，他们强制性地将一群非法居住在白人地盘上的黑人，运送到这片鸟不拉屎的地方，丢给他们一堆胶合板和波状钢：“这里，就是你们的新家了。开始造房子吧。祝你们好运。”我曾在新闻里看过这样的事，就好像那种《荒野生存》真人秀，只不过毫无人性，而且没人能赢得奖金。">查看中文翻译</div>

They were the only decent piece of clothing I owned. Back then, almost no one in South Africa had Timberlands. They were impossible to get, but everyone wanted them because American rappers wore them. I'd scrimped and saved my tuck-shop money and my CD money to buy them. As we were leaving, Tom told me, "Be sure to wear your Timberlands."</div>

<div class="line_en">At the time I had no clue about clothes. My idea of fashion was a brand of clothing called Powerhouse. It was the kind of stuff weight lifters wear down in Miami or out at Venice Beach, baggy track pants with baggy sweatshirts. The logo was a cartoon of this giant bodybuilding bulldog wearing wraparound sunglasses and smoking a cigar and flexing his muscles. On the pants he was flexing all the way down your leg. On the shirt he was flexing across your chest. On the underwear, he was flexing on your crotch. I thought Powerhouse was the baddest thing in the world, I can't even front. I had no friends, I loved dogs, and muscles were cool -- that's where I was working from. I had Powerhouse everything, the full range, five of the same outfit in five different colors. It was easy. The pants came with the top, so I knew how to make it work.</div>

<div class="line_en">All three of Babiki's older sisters spoke English, and her younger sister Lerato spoke a little. So whenever we hung out with Babiki and her sisters and their friends, a lot of the conversation was in English. The rest of it was going right by me in Pedi or in Sotho, but that's completely normal in South Africa so it never bothered me; I got enough of the gist of the conversation from everyone's English to know what was going on. And the way my mind works with language, even when I'm hearing other languages, they get filtered into English as I'm hearing them. My mind stores them in English. When my grandmother and great-grandmother were hysterically praying to God to destroy the demon that had shit on their kitchen floor, all of that transpired in Xhosa, but it's stored in English. I remember it as English. So whenever I lay in bed at night dreaming about Babiki and the moments we'd spent together, I felt like it had transpired in English because that's how I remembered it. And Tom had never said anything about what language she spoke or didn't speak, because why would he care? He just wanted to get his free CDs and get with the sister. Which is how I'd been dating a girl for over a month -- the girl I very much believed was my first girlfriend -- without ever having had a single conversation with her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="芭比姬的三个姐姐都会说英语，她的妹妹勒拉朵也会说一点儿。所以每次我们和芭比姬以及她的姐妹朋友出去玩的时候，大部分对话都是用英语进行的。偶尔会说一些佩迪语，梭托语，但这在南非太正常了，我从来不觉得有问题。我可以从大家说的英语部分中了解整段对话的大意，完全可以明白人们在聊什么。我的大脑就是这样处理语言的，哪怕我听到的是其他语言，它们在我这也会自动转为英语。我的大脑会将其保存为英语。当我的外婆和曾外婆歇斯底里地祈求上帝摧毁那个在家里地板上拉屎的魔鬼时，她们说的是科萨语，但我脑中储存下来的是英语。在记忆里，她们说的是英语。于是当我躺在床上想着芭比姬和我们一起相处的日子时，我感觉我们一直在用英语交流，因为我是这样记得的。汤姆从来没有提过她会说什么语言不会说什么语言，因为他怎么会在乎呢？他只想拿到免费的CD，和她的妹妹约会。我就是这样和一个女孩约会了一个月——我以为她是我的第一个女朋友——然而我跟她之间连一次简单对话都没有过。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Bongani and I stood outside the car, staring at each other. I didn't know what to do. I tried talking to her in every language I knew. Nothing worked. She only spoke Pedi. I got so desperate that I started trying to talk to her using hand signals.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="邦哈尼和我站在车外，彼此大眼瞪小眼。我不知道该怎么办。我开始试着用我会的所有语言和她交流，但都不管用。她只说佩迪语。我绝望了，开始用肢体语言和她比画起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now the whole night came rushing back and I saw it from her point of view, and it was perfectly obvious to me why she didn't want to get out of the car. She probably hadn't wanted to go to the dance with me in the first place; she probably owed Tom a favor, and Tom can talk anyone into anything. Then I'd left her sitting and waiting for me for an hour and she was pissed off. Then she got into the car and it was the first time we had ever been alone, and she realized I couldn't even hold a conversation with her. I'd driven her around and gotten lost in the dark -- a young girl alone in a car in the middle of nowhere with some strange guy, no idea where I was taking her. She was probably terrified. Then we got to the dance and she didn't speak anyone's language. She didn't know anyone. She didn't even know me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在时间倒退，我从她的角度回溯这整件事，就完全理解为什么她不想从车里出来了。首先，她可能一开始就没想和我去舞会，她可能欠了汤姆一个人情，而汤姆可以说服任何人做任何事。然后是我让她在家里坐着等了我一个小时，她生气了。然后她上了我的车，这是我们第一次单独相处，她意识到我和她根本没法交流。我开着车转来转去，在黑夜里迷路——一个年轻姑娘和某个陌生家伙共处一车，迷失在荒无人烟的地方，不知道我要把她带到哪里去，她估计已经吓坏了。然后我们到了舞会，但是她又不会说其他人的语言。她谁也不认识。她连我也不认识。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I asked Bongani if he spoke Pedi. He didn't. I ran inside to the dance and ran around looking for someone who spoke Pedi to help me to convince her to come in. "Do you speak Pedi? Do you speak Pedi? Do you speak Pedi?" Nobody spoke Pedi.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我问邦哈尼他会不会说佩迪语。他不会。我跑进舞会，想找一个会说佩迪语的人帮我劝说她进来。“你会说佩迪语吗？你会说佩迪语吗？你会说佩迪语吗？”没人会说佩迪语。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So I never got to go to my matric dance. Other than the three minutes I spent running through it looking for someone who spoke Pedi, I spent the whole night in the parking lot. When the dance ended, I climbed back into the shitty red Mazda and drove Babiki home. We sat in total awkward silence the whole way.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所以，我完全没有参加过高中毕业舞会。除了跑来跑去问谁会说佩迪语的那三分钟，其他时间我都是在停车场里度过的。舞会结束后，我开着那辆破烂马自达，送芭比姬回了家。全程我们俩都处于一种尴尬的沉默之中。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I pulled up in front of her block of flats in Hillbrow, stopped the car, and sat for a moment as I tried to figure out the polite and gentlemanly way to end the evening. Then, out of nowhere, she leaned over and gave me a kiss. Like, a real kiss, a proper kiss. The kind of kiss that made me forget that the whole disaster had just happened. I was so confused. I didn't know what I was supposed to do. She pulled back and I looked deep into her eyes and thought, I have no idea how girls work.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我把车开到她位于希尔布洛的公寓前停下后，坐了一会儿，想着怎么可以既礼貌又绅士地结束这个夜晚。突然，莫名其妙地，她探身朝我亲了过来。这是一个真正的吻，真真正正的吻。那种让我瞬间忘却今晚所有发生的一切的吻。我不知道该作何反应。她撤回身子，我深深地望着她的眼睛，心想，我完全不懂女生。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I got out of the car, walked around to her side, and opened her door. She gathered up her dress and stepped out and headed toward her flat, and as she turned to go I gave her one last little wave.</div>
