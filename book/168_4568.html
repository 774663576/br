<div class="line_en">Off the bow of the Merling King stretched a bare and stony strand, windswept, treeless, and uninviting. Even so, it made a welcome sight. They had been a long while clawing their way back on course. The last storm had swept them out of sight of land, and sent such waves crashing over the sides of the galley that Sansa had been certain they were all going to drown. Two men had been swept overboard, she had heard old Oswell saying, and another had fallen from the mast and broken his neck.</div>

<div class="line_en">The ladder to the forecastle was steep and splintery, so Sansa accepted a hand up from Lothor Brune. Ser Lothor, she had to remind herself; the man had been knighted for his valor in the Battle of the Blackwater. Though no proper knight would wear those patched brown breeches and scuffed boots, nor that cracked and waterstained leather jerkin. A square-faced stocky man with a squashed nose and a mat of nappy grey hair, Brune spoke seldom. He is stronger than he looks, though. She could tell by the ease with which he lifted her, as if she weighed nothing at all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="上前甲板的楼梯陡峭摇晃，幸亏罗索·布伦伸手相助。罗索爵士，她提醒自己——对方已因黑水河一役中的英勇表现升为骑士，然而骑士不该穿这身打补丁的褐色马裤、拖鞋和风雨侵蚀的皮背心。他是个方脸壮汉，塌鼻子，偏灰发，很少说话，但极强壮。在他手中，珊莎觉得自己轻若鸿毛。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She had seldom ventured out on deck herself. Her little cabin was dank and cold, but Sansa had been sick for most of the voyage… sick with terror, sick with fever, or seasick… she could keep nothing down, and even sleep came hard. Whenever she closed her eyes she saw Joffrey tearing at his collar, clawing at the soft skin of his throat, dying with flakes of pie crust on his lips and wine stains on his doublet. And the wind keening in the lines reminded her of the terrible thin sucking sound he'd made as he fought to draw in air. Sometimes she dreamed of Tyrion as well. "He did nothing," she told Littlefinger once, when he paid a visit to her cabin to see if she were feeling any better.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她很少上甲板，属于她的小舱房则又湿又冷，所以一路都不舒服…恐惧，发烧，晕船…吃不下，睡不着。无论何时，只要闭上眼睛，就会看见撕扯衣领、抓破咽喉、挣扎呼吸的乔佛里，馅饼皮粘在嘴角，酒液则浸染上衣。每有海风吹过木板缝隙，都好似乔佛里当初所发出的那细得吓人、充满恐惧的嘶声。有时她还梦见提利昂。“他什么也没做啊。”小指头来看望她时，她对他说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He did not kill Joffrey, true, but the dwarf's hands are far from clean. He had a wife before you, did you know that?"</div>

<div class="line_en">The wind ran salty fingers through her hair, and Sansa shivered. Even this close to shore, the rolling of the ship made her tummy queasy. She desperately needed a bath and a change of clothes. I must look as haggard as a corpse, and smell of vomit.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="咸咸的海风伸出长长的手指，挽起她的头发，令她打起颤来。即便海岸在望，摇晃的甲板仍教人惴惴不安。她好想洗个澡，换身衣服。我一定跟尸体般又憔悴又难闻。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"A little wine will be good for that. We'll get you a cup, as soon as we're ashore." Petyr pointed to where an old flint tower stood outlined against a bleak grey sky, the breakers crashing on the rocks beneath it. "Cheerful, is it not? I fear there's no safe anchorage here. We'll put ashore in a boat."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“喝点葡萄酒提神，应该会有助益。到得岸上，我立刻满上一杯给你。”语毕，培提尔指向阴沉的天幕底下一座古老无名的燧石塔楼，浪涛在它下方的岩石上拍打。“瞧，就是这儿，景色不错吧？不过呢，大船恐怕没法子靠过去，只能换乘小舟。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Lord Petyr came up beside her, cheerful as ever. "Good morrow. The salt air is bracing, don't you think? It always sharpens my appetite." He put a sympathetic arm about her shoulders. "Are you quite well? You look so pale."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="培提尔大人走到旁边，一如既往地好心情，“早上好。带盐味的风有几分清新，对吧？我的好胃口就是这样子出来的。”他保护性地环住珊莎的肩膀，“你行吗？脸色好苍白。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“没，一点小毛病，我…有些晕船。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Here?" She did not want to go ashore here. The Fingers were a dismal place, she'd heard, and there was something forlorn and desolate about the little tower. "Couldn't I stay on the ship until we make sail for White Harbor?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这儿？”她不想留在这儿。五指半岛阴暗偏僻，眼前这座小塔楼更是孤独荒芜。“我留在船上，好不好？到白港再上岸。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"And there it stands, miserable as it is. My ancestral home. It has no name, I fear. A great lord's seat ought to have a name, wouldn't you agree? Winterfell, the Eyrie, Riverrun, those are castles. Lord of Harrenhal now, that has a sweet ring to it, but what was I before? Lord of Sheepshit and Master of the Drearfort? It lacks a certain something." His grey-green eyes regarded her innocently. "You look distraught. Did you think we were making for Winterfell, sweetling? Winterfell has been taken, burned, and sacked. All those you knew and loved are dead. What northmen who have not fallen to the ironmen are warring amongst themselves. Even the Wall is under attack. Winterfell was the home of your childhood, Sansa, but you are no longer a child. You're a woman grown, and you need to make your own home."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这就是我们的家——别嫌它寒碜，我祖父三代都居于此。它没有名字，大人物的城堡应该有名字的，你说呢？临冬城、鹰巢城、奔流城…好在如今我有了赫伦堡，而之前？之前我乃羊屎伯爵和荒塔主人，哈哈，总觉得缺了点什么。”他用灰绿色眼睛无邪地打量她，“你似乎心神不宁，难不成以为我们会去临冬城？亲爱的，临冬城已经陷落、焚毁、化为废墟，所有你认识或者喜爱的人士都已不在人世。北境有的地方被铁民奴役，有的地方在窝里斗，就连长城也遭到攻打。珊莎，临冬城是你童年的家园，但你已不是孩子了。你长大成为女人，女人需要属于自己的家。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">You said it was my mother you loved. But of course Lady Catelyn was dead, so even if she had loved Petyr secretly and given him her maidenhood, it made no matter now.</div>

<div class="line_en">"… small and bleak and mean? It's all that, and less. The Fingers are a lovely place, if you happen to be a stone. But have no fear, we shan't stay more than a fortnight. I expect your aunt is already riding to meet us." He smiled. "The Lady Lysa and I are to be wed."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“…又窄又小又难看？事实上，情况比你想象的更糟糕。五指半岛乃石头的乐土，岩崖的故乡。好啦，请放心，我们只待半月，你姨妈已在路上了，”他浅浅一笑，“我和莱莎夫人不日即将成婚。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I… I pray you will have long years together, and many children, and be very happy in one another." It had been years since Sansa last saw her mother's sister. She will be kind to me for my mother's sake, surely. She's my own blood. And the Vale of Arryn was beautiful, all the songs said so. Perhaps it would not be so terrible to stay here for a time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我…我祝您们举案齐眉，多福多寿，白头偕老，子孙满堂。”珊莎已有多年未和姨妈团聚。还好，她是我亲戚，为着母亲的缘故，想必会照顾我。她想起歌谣里美丽的艾林谷，宽慰自己暂避一时并非那么可怕。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"So silent, my lady?" said Petyr. "I was certain you would wish to give me your blessing. It is a rare thing for a boy born heir to stones and sheep pellets to wed the daughter of Hoster Tully and the widow of Jon Arryn."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没话说啦，小姐？”培提尔道，“总该给我点祝福吧。一个生来只配继承石头、岩崖和羊屎的男孩能娶上霍斯特·徒利的女儿和琼恩·艾林的遗孀，不值得赞许么？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Lothor and old Oswell rowed them ashore. Sansa huddled in the bow under her cloak with the hood drawn up against the wind, wondering what awaited her. Servants emerged from the tower to meet them; a thin old woman and a fat middle-aged one, two ancient white-haired men, and a girl of two or three with a sty on one eye. When they recognized Lord Petyr they knelt on the rocks. "My household," he said. "I don't know the child. Another of Kella's bastards, I suppose. She pops one out every few years."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="小舟放下，撑船的是罗索和老奥斯威尔。珊莎裹紧斗篷，蜷成一团，拉起兜帽遮挡寒风，不知前方等待着的是何种命运。仆人们走出塔楼，前来迎接，包括一名消瘦的老妪，一名肥胖的中年妇人，两名白发苍苍的男子，还有位一只眼睛长肿块的两三岁女孩。他们认出培提尔大人，纷纷在岩石间跪下，“这就是我的一家人，”小指头介绍，“不过我不认得那孩子，大概又是卡拉的杂种。她每年都要生出个崽子来。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The two old men waded out up to their thighs to lift Sansa from the boat so she would not get her skirts wet. Oswell and Lothor splashed their way ashore, as did Littlefinger himself. He gave the old woman a kiss on the cheek and grinned at the younger one. "Who fathered this one, Kella?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两位老人走到及腿深的水中，将珊莎抱出小舟，以免弄湿裙子。奥斯威尔、罗索和小指头三人则自行上岸。领主给了老妪一吻，又朝中年妇人微笑，“她爹是谁，卡拉？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你工作很负责任，对此我不得不表示感谢。刚才亲眼点过了，石头和羊屎半分不少，”他指指胖妇人，“卡拉照管着我的牧群。卡拉，现下我们有几只羊？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Lord Petyr made a face. "Come, let's see if my hall is as dreary as I recall." He led them up the strand over rocks slick with rotting seaweed. A handful of sheep were wandering about the base of the flint tower, grazing on the thin grass that grew between the sheepfold and thatched stable. Sansa had to step carefully; there were pellets everywhere.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="培提尔公爵扮个鬼脸，“来吧，瞧瞧我的厅堂是否还有记忆中的阴暗。”他当先领大家穿越海岸，踏过海草缠绕的滑溜岩石。荒塔底，几只羊漫无目的地游荡，不时咀嚼羊圈间和茅屋顶的那点薄草。珊莎走得很小心，因为到处都是屎。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The device painted on the shield was one Sansa did not know; a grey stone head with fiery eyes, upon a light green field. "My grandfather's shield," Petyr explained when he saw her gazing at it. "His own father was born in Braavos and came to the Vale as a sellsword in the hire of Lord Corbray, so my grandfather took the head of the Titan as his sigil when he was knighted."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="珊莎根本不认得这个纹章：嫩绿底色上一只有凶猛眼睛的灰石脑袋。“这是我祖父的盾牌，”培提尔跟她解释，“他的父亲则是布拉佛斯佣兵。他到谷地为科布瑞大人效力，受封骑士后，选了布拉佛斯泰坦巨人的头作为纹章。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Within, the tower seemed even smaller. An open stone stair wound round the inside wall, from undercroft to roof. Each floor was but a single room. The servants lived and slept in the kitchen at ground level, sharing the space with a huge brindled mastiff and a half-dozen sheepdogs. Above that was a modest hall, and higher still the bedchamber. There were no windows, but arrowslits were embedded in the outer wall at intervals along the curve of the stair. Above the hearth hung a broken longsword and a battered oaken shield, its paint cracked and flaking.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="塔楼内部窄得吓人。墙面上有一道蜿蜒敞开的螺旋梯，从地下室直通塔顶，每层楼只有一个房间。仆人们吃住都在底楼厨房，与一只巨大的斑纹獒犬和六七只牧羊犬同居。二楼是一个小厅，三楼则为卧室。厅内没有窗户，好歹楼梯间隔中开了些箭孔。壁炉顶挂着一把破损的长剑和一张击扁的橡木盾牌，其上装饰几不可辨。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Oswell made two more trips out to the Merling King to offload provisions. Among the loads he brought ashore were several casks of wine. Petyr poured Sansa a cup, as promised. "Here, my lady, that should help your tummy, I would hope."</div>

He was too sick and toothless to walk guard with Bryen anymore, and mostly all he did was sleep, but when she patted him he whined and licked her hand, and after that they were fast friends. When the rains let up, Petyr walked with her around his holdings, which took less than half a day. He owned a lot of rocks, just as he had said. There was one place where the tide came jetting up out of a blowhole to shoot thirty feet into the air, and another where someone had chiseled the seven-pointed star of the new gods upon a boulder.

Lysa's singer played "The Vow Unspoken" and "Seasons of My Love" and "Two Hearts That Beat as One." Several younger knights even asked Sansa to dance.

By the time they had gotten him into the tower and out of his clothes, the other women were flushed, with laces unlaced, kirtles crooked, and skirts in disarray.

"Make me a baby, Petyr," she screamed, "make me another sweet little baby. Oh, Petyr, my precious, my precious, PEEEEEETYR!"

<div class="line_en">She stayed outside for a long time. When at last she sought her own bed, wet and chilled, only the dim glow of a peat fire lit the darkened hall. There was no sound from above. The young singer sat in a corner, playing a slow song to himself. One of her aunt's maids was kissing a knight in Lord Petyr's chair, their hands busy beneath each other's clothing. Several men had drunk themselves to sleep, and one was in the privy, being noisily sick. Sansa found Bryen's old blind dog in her little alcove beneath the steps, and lay down next to him. He woke and licked her face. "You sad old hound," she said, ruffling his fur.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sansa went down the steps and out into the night. A light rain was falling on the remains of the feast, but the air smelled fresh and clean. The memory of her own wedding night with Tyrion was much with her. In the dark, I am the Knight of Flowers, he had said. I could be good to you. But that was only another Lannister lie. A dog can smell a lie, you know, the Hound had told her once. She could almost hear the rough rasp of his voice. Look around you, and take a good whiff. They're all liars here, and every one better than you. She wondered what had become of Sandor Clegane. Did he know that they'd killed Joffrey? Would he care? He had been the prince's sworn shield for years.</div>

<div class="line_en">,'No more than I did," her aunt said. "Jon Arryn was no dwarf, but he was old. You may not think so to see me now, but on the day we wed I was so lovely I put your mother to shame. But all Jon desired was my father's swords, to aid his darling boys. I should have refused him, but he was such an old man, how long could he live? Half his teeth were gone, and his breath smelled like bad cheese. I cannot abide a man with foul breath. Petyr's breath is always fresh… he was the first man I ever kissed, you know. My father said he was too lowborn, but I knew how high he'd rise. Jon gave him the customs for Gulltown to please me, but when he increased the incomes tenfold my lord husband saw how clever he was and gave him other appointments, even brought him to King's Landing to be master of coin. That was hard, to see him every day and still be wed to that old cold man. Jon did his duty in the bedchamber, but he could no more give me pleasure than he could give me children. His seed was old and weak. All my babies died but Robert, three girls and two boys. All my sweet little babies dead, and that old man just went on and on with his stinking breath. So you see, I have suffered too." Lady Lysa sniffed. "You do know that your poor mother is dead?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不也一样？”姨妈道，“琼恩·艾林虽非侏儒，却是个老头。你看我现在的容颜，多半不以为然，可当年我结婚时，美得让你母亲无地自容。那个琼恩，他要的只是父亲的军队，好支持他所钟爱的孩子。我早该彻底回绝他，可看他那么老，能活几年？牙齿掉了一半，呼吸闻起来活像酸败的干酪…我最不能忍受的就是他的味道，培提尔的口气多么清新明朗…你知道吗？我的初吻便给了他。父亲说他出身太低，简直是个无耻之徒，可我知道他总有一天能够出人头地。在我的要求下，琼恩让他管理海鸥镇的海关，没过多久，税赋便翻了十番。夫君发现他的才干，就提拔他节节晋升，最后带到君临城中当上财政大臣。接下来的几年，对我来说真不容易，每天都能见到他，却必须始终和那个冷冰冰的老头待在一起。没错，琼恩懂得在床上履行责任，可连给我一个好孩子都做不到。他的种子又老又弱，我们之间有过三个男孩、三个女孩，结果除了我的小亲亲劳勃，一个也没活成。我的小宝贝们全死啦，可这老头还每每臭气熏天地爬上我的床铺。你瞧，我说得没错吧？我和你一样，”莱莎夫人吸吸鼻子，“你知道你那可怜的母亲已经死了吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Lady Lysa seemed pleased by that. "I knew that boy Joffrey. He used to call my Robert cruel names, and once he slapped him with a wooden sword. A man will tell you poison is dishonorable, but a woman's honor is different. The Mother shaped us to protect our children, and our only dishonor is in failure. You'll know that, when you have a child."</div>

He is full of low cunning, that one. His sellsword slew my good Ser Vardis Egen. Catelyn should not have brought him here, I told her that. She made off with our uncle too. That was wrong of her. The Blackfish was my Knight of the Gate, and since he left us the mountain clans are growing very bold. Petyr will soon set all that to rights, though. I shall make him Lord Protector of the Vale." Her aunt smiled for the first time, almost warmly. "He may not look as tall or strong as some, but he is worth more than all of them. Trust in him and do as he says."</div>

The gods sometimes let us glimpse the future as we lay dying. I see no reason why you should not be wed as soon as we know that your Lannister husband is dead. A secret wedding, to be sure. The Lord of the Eyrie could scarcely be thought to have married a bastard, that would not be fitting. The ravens should bring us the word from King's Landing once the Imp's head rolls. You and Robert can be wed the next day, won't that be joyous? it will be good for him to have a little companion. He played with Vardis Egen's boy when we first returned to the Eyrie, and my steward's sons as well, but they were much too rough and I had no choice but to send them away.

<div class="line_en">"Robert has weak eyes, but he loves to be read to," Lady Lysa confided. "He likes stories about animals the best. Do you know the little song about the chicken who dressed as a fox? I sing him that all the time, he never grows tired of it. And he likes to play hopfrog and spin-the-sword and come-into-my-castle, but you must always let him win. That's only proper, don't you think? He is the Lord of the Eyrie, after all, you must never forget that. You are well born, and the Starks of Winterfell were always proud, but Winterfell has fallen and you are really just a beggar now, so put that pride aside. Gratitude will better become you, in your present circumstances. Yes, and obedience. My son will have a grateful and obedient wife."</div>
