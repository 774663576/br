<div class="line_en">"Is Britt-Marie still here?" she says, with a nod towards the door.</div>

<div class="line_en">Elsa has a thousand questions about what Alf just said, but doesn't ask any of them because Mum is so tired once they've gone up into the flat that she and Halfie have to go straight to bed. Mum gets like that these days, tired as if someone pulled the plug. It's Halfie's fault, apparently. George says that to compensate for Halfie keeping them awake for the next eighteen years, Halfie is making Mum fall asleep all the time for the first nine months. Elsa sits on the edge of the bed stroking her hair; Mum kisses her hands, whispering, "It will get better, darling. It will be fine." Like Granny used to say. And Elsa wants so, so much to believe that. Mum smiles sleepily.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱莎对阿尔夫说的话有一千个疑问，但妈妈太累了，一回到家，她和“小半”就直接去睡觉了。妈妈这些日子总这样，累得像是有人拔掉了她的电源。据说这是“小半”的错。乔治说，为了补偿“小半”会让他们在未来的十八年里都睡不着，所以“小半”让妈妈在最初的九个月里一直睡觉。爱莎坐在床沿，轻抚着妈妈的头发，而妈妈亲了亲她的手，小声说：“一切都会好的，亲爱的。都会没事的。”就像外婆常说的。爱莎非常、非常想相信。妈妈睡眼蒙眬地笑了笑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Britt-Marie's nagging voice emanates from the kitchen, so the question immediately becomes rhetorical. She's demanding "a decision" from George on Renault, which is still parked in Britt-Marie's slot in the garage. ("We can't live without rules, George! Even Ulrika has to understand that!") George answers cheerfully that he can understand that well enough, because George can understand everyone's point of view. It's one of the annoying things about him, and, sure enough, seems to be getting Britt-Marie into a huff. And then George offers her some eggs, which she ignores, insisting instead that all tenants "submit to a full investigation" regarding the stroller, which is still locked up at the bottom of the stairs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布里特—玛丽的牢骚声从厨房传来，于是这问题立马变成了反问。她正要求乔治针对还停在她车位上的雷诺给她一个“决定”。（“我们不能不守规矩，乔治！即便是乌尔莉卡也得明白这点！”）乔治爽朗地回答他能理解。乔治总是能理解每个人的观点，这是他很招人烦的一点，毫无疑问布里特—玛丽就很不痛快。然后乔治问她要不要来些煎蛋，她无视了这个问题，坚持要对所有的租户都“进行全面盘查”，针对现在还锁在底层的婴儿车。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Elsa laughs. But only a little. And she thinks that the mystery of the locked stroller is like the opening of an insanely awful Agatha Christie novel. Elsa knows that because almost all of Agatha Christie's novels can be read on the iPad, and Agatha Christie has never had such a stereotypical villain as Britt-Marie. More likely she'd be a victim, because Elsa can imagine a murder mystery in which someone has bludgeoned Britt-Marie to death with a candlestick in the library, and then everyone who knew her would be a suspect because everyone would have a motive: "The hag was a nightmare!" And then Elsa feels a bit ashamed for thinking along these lines. But only a little.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱莎大笑，但只笑了一会儿。她觉得那辆锁着的谜之婴儿车就像是一本非常糟糕的阿加莎·克里斯蒂小说的开头。几乎所有阿加莎·克里斯蒂的小说都可以在平板电脑上阅读，而阿加莎·克里斯蒂从来没有写过像布里特—玛丽这么老套典型的坏人。她更像是个受害者，爱莎可以想象这样一起神秘谋杀案，有人在图书馆里拿烛台把布里特—玛丽重击致死，而所有认识她的人都有嫌疑，因为每个人都有动机：“这老太婆是场噩梦！”但爱莎又为自己的想法感到点儿羞愧。不过也就一丁点儿。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Don't worry, darling, we'll find a better hiding place for your friend tomorrow," Mum mumbles half in her sleep, and then adds with a smile: "Maybe we can hide it in the stroller?"</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="妈妈笑了。她在枕头上躺舒服，爱莎帮她在背部塞了个枕头。妈妈拍了一下爱莎的脸蛋，低声说：“我现在想听那些故事了，如果可以的话。我想听密阿玛斯的童话故事。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And Elsa still has a thousand questions but does not ask any of them. She just covers Mum and Halfie with the blanket and kisses Mum on the cheek and forces herself to be brave.

<div class="line_cn" title="爱莎还有一千个问题，但没有问出任何一个。她只是给妈妈和“小半”盖上毯子，亲了一下妈妈的脸颊，强迫自己鼓起勇气，因为外婆曾让她发过誓：保护城堡，保护她的家人，保护她的朋友。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And then Elsa whispers calmly that Mum has to close her eyes but only halfway, and then Mum does as she says, and Elsa has a thousand questions but does not ask any of them. Instead she talks about the cloud animals and the enphants and the regretters and lions and trolls and knights and the Noween and Wolfheart and the snow-angels and the sea-angel and the dream hunters, and she starts talking about the Princess of Miploris and the two princelings who fought for her love, and the witch who stole the princess's treasure, but by then Mum and Halfie are asleep.</div>

<div class="line_en">The flat smells of dishcloth, and George is collecting used coffee cups. The strangers were all here today drinking coffee after the funeral. They smiled sympathetically at Elsa and Elsa hates them for it. Hates that they knew Granny before she did. She goes into Granny's flat and lies on Granny's bed. The streetlight outside plays against the photos on the ceiling, and, as she watches, Elsa still doesn't know if she can forgive Granny for leaving Mum on her own so she could save other children. She doesn't know if Mum can forgive it either. Even if she seems to be trying.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="公寓里一股洗碗布的气味，乔治正在收拾用过的咖啡杯。今天葬礼之后，那些陌生人都在这里喝咖啡。他们冲着爱莎露出同情的笑容，爱莎因此恨他们。恨他们比她早认识外婆。她走进外婆的公寓，躺在外婆的床上。屋外的街灯照着天花板上的照片，爱莎看着它们，依旧不知道自己能否原谅外婆，原谅她为了救别的孩子而抛下妈妈一个人。她也不知道妈妈是否能原谅，即使她看起来在试着这么做。">查看中文翻译</div>
