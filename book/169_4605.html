<div class="line_en">As the rising sun came streaming through the windows, Alayne sat up in bed and stretched. Gretchel heard her stir and rose at once to fetch her bedrobe. The rooms had grown chilly during the night. It will be worse when winter has us in its grip, she thought. Winter will make this place as cold as any tomb. Alayne slipped into the robe and belted it about her waist. "The fire's almost out," she observed. "Put another log on, if you would."</div>

<div class="line_en">Alayne's apartments in the Maiden's Tower were larger and more lavish than the little bedchamber where she'd been kept when Lady Lysa was alive. She had a dressing room and a privy of her own now, and a balcony of carved white stone that looked off across the Vale. While Gretchel was tending to the fire, Alayne padded barefoot across the room and slipped outside. The stone was cold beneath her feet, and the wind was blowing fiercely, as it always did up here, but the view made her forget all that for half a heartbeat. Maiden's was the easternmost of the Eyrie's seven slender towers, so she had the Vale before her, its forests and rivers and fields all hazy in the morning light. The way the sun was hitting the mountains made them look like solid gold.</div>

<div class="line_en">Young Lord Hunter and his levies had joined the others two days past. Nestor Royce had closed the Gates against them, but he had fewer than three hundred men in his garrison. Each of the Lords Declarant had brought a thousand, and there were six of them. Alayne knew their names as well as her own. Benedar Belmore, Lord of Strongsong. Symond Templeton, the Knight of Ninestars. Horton Redfort, Lord of Redfort. Anya Waynwood, Lady of Ironoaks. Gilwood Hunter, called Young Lord Hunter by all and sundry, Lord of Longbow Hall. And Yohn Royce, mightiest of them all, the redoubtable Bronze Yohn, Lord of Runestone, Nestor's cousin and the chief of the senior branch of House Royce. The six had gathered at Runestone after Lysa Arryn's fall, and there made a pact together, vowing to defend Lord Robert, the Vale, and one another. Their declaration made no mention of the Lord Protector, but spoke of "misrule" that must be ended, and of "false friends and evil counselors" as well.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="小杭特伯爵的队伍于两天前抵达，其他人则早到了。奈斯特·罗伊斯关门抗拒，但他麾下士兵尚不满三百，而前来逼宫的六镇诸侯每人皆带来一千精锐。阿莲像清楚自己的真名一样清楚这些人的名讳：本内达·贝尔摩，洪歌城伯爵；赛蒙·坦帕顿，九星城的骑士；霍顿·雷德佛，红垒伯爵；安雅·韦伍德，铁橡城伯爵夫人；杰伍德·杭特——呼为“小杭特”——长弓厅伯爵；以及六镇中强大者约恩·罗伊斯，外号“青铜约恩”，声名显赫的符石城伯爵，乃奈斯特的表兄和罗伊斯家族本家的族长。自莱莎·艾林坠落之后，这六镇诸侯就在符石城商讨，最终签订了盟约，誓言共举义旗，保境安民，并为劳勃公爵和谷地而战。他们的声明中丝毫没提到峡谷守护者，反而要求“终结乱政”，清理“宵小奸臣”。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So lovely. The snow-clad summit of the Giant's Lance loomed above her, an immensity of stone and ice that dwarfed the castle perched upon its shoulder. Icicles twenty feet long draped the lip of the precipice where Alyssa's Tears fell in summer. A falcon soared above the frozen waterfall, blue wings spread wide against the morning sky. Would that I had wings as well.</div>

<div class="line_en">She rested her hands on the carved stone balustrade and made herself peer over the edge. She could see Sky six hundred feet below, and the stone steps carved into the mountain, the winding way that led past Snow and Stone all the way down to the valley floor. She could see the towers and keeps of the Gates of the Moon, as small as a child's toys. Around the walls the hosts of Lords Declarant were stirring, emerging from their tents like ants from an anthill. If only they were truly ants, she thought, we could step on them and crush them.</div>

<div class="line_en">A cold gust of wind blew up her legs. She went inside to choose a gown to break her fast in. Petyr had given her his late wife's wardrobe, a wealth of silks, satins, velvets, and furs far beyond anything she had ever dreamed, though the great bulk of it was far too large for her; Lady Lysa had grown very stout during her long succession of pregnancies, stillbirths, and miscarriages. A few of the oldest gowns had been made for young Lysa Tully of Riverrun, however, and others Gretchel had been able to alter to fit Alayne, who was almost as long of leg at three-and-ten as her aunt had been at twenty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="冷风拍打着小腿，她回屋换装，准备用餐。培提尔将前妻的衣橱尽数赠予，里面有她做梦也不敢想象的无数丝衣、绸缎、天鹅绒与毛皮，不过大都既肥且宽——莱莎多次怀孕又多次死产流产后，已彻底没了体形——阿莲只穿得上奔流城年轻二小姐的那些旧裙服。吉思尔负责把其他衣服一件一件改好，毕竟，十三岁的阿莲已比她姨妈二十岁时高出一胫。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This morning her eye was caught by a parti-colored gown of Tully red and blue, lined with vair. Gretchel helped her slide her arms into the belled sleeves and laced her back, then brushed and pinned her hair. Alayne had darkened it again last night before she went to bed. The wash her aunt had given her changed her own rich auburn into Alayne's burnt brown, but it was seldom long before the red began creeping back at the roots. And what must I do when the dye runs out? The wash had come from Tyrosh, across the narrow sea.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="今天早上，她看上一件徒利家族红蓝相间的裙服，边缘镶有松鼠毛，于是吉思尔帮她穿进喇叭袖，捆好背带，再梳挽她的长发——昨晚临睡前，阿莲刚重新染过。姨妈将她枣红色的秀发染成了深棕色，然而过不多久，发根又会变红，所以得时时补料。染料用完后我该怎么办呢？毕竟那是从狭海对岸的泰洛西得来的稀罕之物。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She found Lord Robert alone in the Morning Hall above the kitchens, pushing a wooden spoon listlessly through a big bowl of porridge and honey. "I wanted eggs," he complained when he saw her. "I wanted three eggs boiled soft, and some back bacon."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="劳勃大人独坐在厨房上方的明月厅内，无精打采地用木匙掏着一大碗蜂蜜麦片粥。“我要鸡蛋，”他看见她便抱怨，“我要三个煮得软软的鸡蛋，外加煎好的培根。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As she went down to break her fast, Alayne was struck again by the stillness of the Eyrie. There was no quieter castle in all the Seven Kingdoms. The servants here were few and old and kept their voices down so as not to excite the young lord. There were no horses on the mountain, no hounds to bark and growl, no knights training in the yard. Even the footsteps of the guards seemed strangely muffled as they walked the pale stone halls. She could hear the wind moaning and sighing round the towers, but that was all. When she had first come to Eyrie, there had been the murmur of Alyssa's Tears as well, but the waterfall was frozen now. Gretchel said it would stay silent till the spring.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="下楼梯时，她再度感叹于鹰巢城的寂静，只怕七国上下没有比这里更沉默的城堡了。此地的仆从不仅稀少，而且个个老迈，交流时也识趣地压低声音，以免惊扰暴躁的少主。山上没有马厩，没有猎狗咆哮，没有骑士操练比武，连守卫们在白石厅堂里巡逻的脚步声也显得疏远缥缈，她唯一能清晰分辨的，乃是寒风席卷尖塔的呜咽与叹息。想起刚来城里时，至少还能听见阿莱莎之泪的缠绵，如今吉思尔说瀑布要到春天才会解冻。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They had no eggs, no more than they had bacon. The Eyrie's granaries held sufficient oats and corn and barley to feed them for a year, but they depended on a bastard girl named Mya Stone to bring fresh foodstuffs up from the valley floor. With the Lords Declarant encamped at the foot of the mountain there was no way for Mya to get through. Lord Belmore, first of the six to reach the Gates, had sent a raven to tell Littlefinger that no more food would go up to the Eyrie until he sent Lord Robert down. It was not quite a siege, not as yet, but it was the next best thing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们没有鸡蛋，更没有培根。鹰巢城粮仓里储备的燕麦、玉米和大麦足以支撑一年之久，但新鲜食品都是由一位名叫米亚·石东的私生女孩从谷地带上来的。如今公义者同盟封锁了山路，米亚不敢冒险穿越——六镇诸侯非常清楚这点，他们中最先赶来的贝尔摩伯爵刚到山下便派乌鸦传信警告小指头，只要他还挟持着劳勃公爵，就别想得到任何供应。换言之，鹰巢城没有遭到严格意义上的围困，但情况也好不到哪里去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Just Lord Robert. Him, and the Vale." Petyr smiled. "There will be eight of them. Lord Nestor is showing them up, and they have Lyn Corbray with them. Ser Lyn is not the sort of man to stay away when blood is in the offing."</div>

<div class="line_en">His words did little to soothe her fears. Lyn Corbray had slain almost as many men in duels as he had in battle. He had won his spurs during Robert's Rebellion, she knew, fighting first against Lord Jon Arryn at the gates of Gulltown, and later beneath his banners on the Trident, where he had cut down Prince Lewyn of Dorne, a white knight of the Kingsguard. Petyr said that Prince Lewyn had been sorely wounded by the time the tide of battle swept him to his final dance with Lady Forlorn, but added, "That's not a point you'll want to raise with Corbray, though. Those who do are soon given the chance to ask Martell himself the truth of it, down in the halls of hell." If even half of what she had heard from Lord Robert's guards was true, Lyn Corbray was more dangerous than all six of the Lords Declarant put together. "Why is he coming?" she asked. "I thought the Corbrays were for you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="小指头的话只能加剧她的恐慌。传说在比武场上被林恩·科布瑞杀掉的人和在战场上被他杀掉的人一样多。他的骑士封号是助劳勃叛乱而获得的，起初，他在海鸥镇外对抗琼恩·艾林公爵，后来投靠叛军参加三叉戟河决战，并在会战中击杀了著名的御林铁卫，多恩的勒文亲王。培提尔告诉阿莲，当勒文亲王最终对上科布瑞那柄名剑“空寂女士”时，已然伤痕累累，难以为继，但他又随即补充，“这些言语你可不能在科布瑞面前提起，所有问起他与马泰尔一战真相的人，都被他送到地狱里去向他的对手提问了。”实际上，只要她从鹰巢城守卫们口中听来的故事有一半真实，林恩·科布瑞就已经比公义者同盟的六位诸侯加起来还要危险。“他怎么也来？”阿莲急促地追问，“我还以为科布瑞家站在您这边呢。”">查看中文翻译</div>

So when old Lord Corbray died, he bestowed the Lady upon his younger son.

<div class="line_en">Globs of porridge dotted Maester Colemon's face and hair as he knelt over his charge, murmuring soothing words. One gobbet crept slowly down his right cheek, like a lumpy grey-brown tear. It is not so bad a spell as the last one, Alayne thought, trying to be hopeful. By the time the shaking stopped, two guards in sky-blue cloaks and silvery mail shirts had come at Petyr's summons. "Take him back to bed and leech him," the Lord Protector said, and the taller guardsman scooped the boy up in his arms. I could carry him myself, Alayne thought. He is no heavier than a doll.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I do not! Let my porridge fly!" This time Robert flung the bowl, porridge and honey and all. Petyr Baelish ducked aside nimbly, but Maester Colemon was not so quick. The wooden bowl caught him square in the chest, and its contents exploded upward over his face and shoulders. He yelped in a most unmaesterlike fashion, while Alayne turned to soothe the little lordling, but too late. The fit was on him. A pitcher of milk went flying as his hand caught it, flailing.

After Maddy laid the fire, she sent her down to find the scented beeswax candles Lord Waxley had given Lady Lysa when he sought to win her hand. Then she visited the kitchens once again, to make certain of the wine and bread. All seemed well in hand, and there was still time enough for her to bathe and wash her hair and change. There was a gown of purple silk that gave her pause, and another of dark blue velvet slashed with silver that would have woken all the color in her eyes, but in the end she remembered that Alayne was after all a bastard, and must not presume to dress above her station. The dress she picked was lambswool, dark brown and simply cut, with leaves and vines embroidered around the bodice, sleeves, and hem in golden thread. It was modest and becoming, though scarce richer than something a serving girl might wear. Petyr had given her all of Lady Lysa's jewels as well, and she tried on several necklaces, but they all seemed ostentatious. In the end she chose a simple velvet ribbon in autumn gold. When Gretchel fetched her Lysa's silvered looking glass, the color seemed just perfect with Alayne's mass of dark brown hair. Lord Royce will never know me, she thought.

Lady Anya was the only woman amongst the Lords Declarant, and wore a deep green mantle with the broken wheel of Waynwood picked out in beads of jet. Six silver bells on purple, that was Belmore, pear-bellied and round of shoulder. His beard was a ginger-grey horror sprouting from a multiplicity of chins. Symond Templeton's, by contrast, was black and sharply pointed. A beak of a nose and icy blue eyes made the Knight of Ninestars look like some elegant bird of prey. His doublet displayed nine black stars within a golden saltire. Young Lord Hunter's ermine cloak confused her till she spied the brooch that pinned it, five silver arrows fanned. Alayne would have put his age closer to fifty than to forty. His father had ruled at Longbow Hall for nigh on sixty years, only to die so abruptly that some whispered the new lord had hastened his inheritance. Hunter's cheeks and nose were red as apples, which bespoke a certain fondness for the grape. She made certain to fill his cup as often as he emptied it.</div>

She heard his voice booming off the walls when he rode back from a hunt with a buck behind his saddle. She could see him in the yard, a practice sword in hand, hammering her father to the ground and turning to defeat Ser Rodrik as well. He will know me. How could he not?
