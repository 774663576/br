<div class="line_en">Harry and Dumbledore approached the back door of the Burrow, which was surrounded by the familiar litter of old Wellington boots and rusty cauldrons; Harry could hear the soft clucking of sleepy chickens coming from a distant shed. Dumbledore knocked three times and Harry saw sudden movement behind the kitchen window.</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry looked around and saw that Mrs. Weasley was not alone, despite the lateness of the hour. A young witch with a pale, heart-shaped face and mousy brown hair was sitting at the table clutching a large mug between her hands.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利环顾了一下周围，才发现尽管天色已经很晚了，韦斯莱夫人却并不是独自一人。一个年轻的女巫正坐在桌旁，两只手里捧着一个大茶杯。她心形的面孔显得有些苍白，头发是灰褐色的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You're like Ron," she sighed, looking him up and down. "Both of you look as though you've had Stretching jinxes put on you. I swear Ron's grown four inches since I last bought him school robes. Are you hungry, Harry?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你跟罗恩一样，”她上上下下地打量着他，说道，“你们俩都好像中了伸长咒似的。我敢说，自从我上次给罗恩买校袍到现在，他长了整整四英寸。你饿了吗，哈利？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He made Mrs. Weasley a bow and followed Tonks, vanishing at precisely the same spot. Mrs. Weasley closed the door on the empty yard and then steered Harry by the shoulders into the full glow of the lantern on the table to examine his appearance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他朝韦斯莱夫人鞠了一躬，紧跟在唐克斯后面，就在同一个地方消失了。院子里没了人，韦斯莱夫人关上门，扶着哈利的肩膀，把他领到桌上那盏灯的灯光下，仔细端详着他的模样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“是啊，她是前天来的。”韦斯莱夫人说着用魔杖敲了敲一只大铁锅。铁锅咣当一声跳到了炉子上，立刻开始翻滚冒泡。“当然啦，这会儿大家都睡觉了，我们以为你过几个小时才会来呢。给——”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="她把魔杖朝肩膀后面一挥，一块面包和一把刀子就优雅地飞到了桌上。面包自动切成了片，汤锅又飞回去落在炉子上。韦斯莱夫人在哈利对面坐了下来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“这么说，是你说服霍拉斯·斯拉格霍恩接受了那份工作？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="哈利点了点头，他嘴里满是热汤，说不出话来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She tapped the pot again; it rose into the air, flew toward Harry, and tipped over; Mrs. Weasley slid a bowl nearly beneath it just in time to catch the stream of thick, steaming onion soup.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她又敲了敲铁锅。铁锅升到空中，朝哈利飞来，然后又歪向一边，韦斯莱夫人赶紧把一只碗塞在下面，正好接住了它倒出来的浓浓的、热气腾腾的洋葱汤。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He taught Arthur and me," said Mrs. Weasley. "He was at Hogwarts for ages, started around the same time as Dumbledore, I think. Did you like him?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他以前教过亚瑟和我。”韦斯莱夫人说，“很多年以前他就在霍格沃茨，我想，他和邓布利多差不多同时间进校的。你喜欢他吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His mouth now full of bread, Harry shrugged and gave a non-committal jerk of the head.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利嘴里又塞满了面包，只好耸耸肩膀，不置可否地甩了一下脑袋。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I know what you mean," said Mrs. Weasley, nodding wisely. "Of course he can be charming when he wants to be, but Arthur's never liked him much. The Ministry's littered with Slughorn's old favorites, he was always good at giving leg ups, but he never had much time for Arthur… didn't seem to think he was enough of a highflier. Well, that just shows you, even Slughorn makes mistakes. I don't know whether Ron's told you in any of his letters… it's only just happened… but Arthur's been promoted!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我明白你的意思。”韦斯莱夫人心领神会地点点头，“不错，如果他愿意，是可以使自己变得很有魅力的，但亚瑟从来就不太喜欢他。魔法部里有许多他过去的得意门生，他总是愿意给学生开小灶，但从来不肯在亚瑟身上多花时间——他似乎认为亚瑟没有什么抱负。嘿，这就证明，就连斯拉格霍恩也会看走了眼。不知道罗恩是不是已经写信告诉你了——这还是最近的事呢——亚瑟提升了！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You are sweet," beamed Mrs. Weasley, possibly taking his watering eyes for emotion at the news. "Yes, Rufus Scrimgeour has set up several new offices in response to the present situation, and Arthur's heading the Office for the Detection and Confiscation of Counterfeit Defensive Spells and Protective Objects. It's a big job, he's got ten people reporting to him now!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你真可爱。”韦斯莱夫人笑眯眯地说，她大概以为哈利眼泪汪汪是因为听了喜讯激动的，“是啊，为了对目前的局势做出反应，鲁弗斯·斯克林杰又新设了几个部门，亚瑟现在主管‘伪劣防御魔咒及防护用品侦察收缴办公室’。这个工作很重要，现在手下有十个人呢！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What exactly --?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那究竟是——”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, you see, in all the panic about You-Know-Who, odd things have been cropping up for sale everywhere, things that are supposed to guard against You-Know-Who and the Death Eaters. You can imagine the kind of thing… so-called protective potions that are really gravy with a bit of Bubotuber pus added, or instructions for defensive jinxes that actually make your ears fall off… Well, in the main the perpetrators are just people like Mundungus Hotelier, who've never done an honest day's work in their lives and are taking advantage of how frightened everybody is, but every now and then something really nasty turns up. The other day Arthur confiscated a box of cursed Sneakoscopes that were almost certainly planted by a Death Eater. So you see, it's a very important job, and I tell him it's just silly to miss dealing with spark plugs and toasters and all the rest of that Muggle rubbish." Mrs. Weasley ended her speech with a stern look, as if it had been Harry suggesting that it was natural to miss spark-plugs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“噢，是这样，神秘人搞得大家人心惶惶，到处都有人弄一些稀奇古怪的东西出来卖钱，说是能够抵御神秘人和食死徒。你能想象那种玩意儿——所谓的防身药剂，实际上就是肉汤加上一点儿淋巴脓，还有防御魔咒的操作指南，实际上只会让你掉了耳朵…唉，一般来说，做这些坏事的只是蒙顿格斯·弗莱奇那样的人，他们一辈子没有一天好好干活的，现在利用人们的恐惧心理趁火打劫。可是偶尔也会碰到真正的恶性事件。那天，亚瑟收缴了一箱施了魔咒的窥镜，几乎可以肯定是某个食死徒安置在那里的。所以你看，这是一项很重要的工作，我跟他说，现在再惦记着火花塞、烤面包炉以及麻瓜们的其他破烂，就显得太可笑了。”韦斯莱夫人说到最后，眼神变得严厉起来，似乎是哈利提出应该惦记火花塞的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It's been like that for a while now," said Mrs. Weasley, in an unconvincingly casual voice, "ever since You-Know-Who came back into the open. I suppose everybody's in mortal danger now… I don't think it can be just our family… but I don't know anyone else who's got a clock like this, so I can't check. Oh!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“它这个样子有一段时间了，”韦斯莱夫人用一种装出来的轻描淡写的口气说，但装得不像，“自从神秘人公开复出以后，它就是这样。我想现在每个人都处于致命危险中…不可能只是我们家里的人…但我不知道谁家还有这样的钟，所以没法核实。哦！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She turned to look at a large clock that was perched awkwardly on top of a pile of sheets in the washing basket at the end of the table. Harry recognized it at once: it had nine hands, each inscribed with the name of a family member, and usually hung on the Weasleys' sitting room wall, though its current position suggested that Mrs. Weasley had taken to carrying it around the house with her. Every single one of its nine hands was now pointing at mortal peril.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她扭头去看那个大钟，那大钟放在桌边洗衣篮里的一大堆床单上，显得很不协调。哈利一眼就认了出来：它有九根指针，每根针上都刻着家里一位成员的名字，平常总是挂在韦斯莱家客厅的墙上。它现在放在这里，可见韦斯莱夫人在家里走到哪儿就把它带到哪儿。眼下，那九根针都指着致命危险。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Fred and George's bedroom was on the second floor. Mrs. Weasley pointed her wand at a lamp on the bedside table and it ignited at once, bathing the room in a pleasant golden glow. Though a large vase of flowers had been placed on a desk in front of the small window, their perfume could not disguise the lingering smell of what Harry thought was gunpowder. A considerable amount of floor space was devoted to a vast number of unmarked, sealed cardboard boxes, amongst which stood Harry's school trunk. The room looked as though it was being used as a temporary warehouse.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="弗雷德和乔治的卧室在三楼。韦斯莱夫人用魔杖指了指床头柜上的一盏台灯，它立刻就亮了，给房间里洒下一片温馨柔和的光。那扇小窗户前面的桌上放着一大瓶鲜花，但它们的香味并不能掩盖残留在房间里的气味——哈利认为是火药味。地板上一大片地方都堆放着许多没有标名的密封的硬纸箱，哈利上学用的箱子也在其中。这个房间看上去像是一个临时仓库。">查看中文翻译</div>

Harry bade Mrs. Weasley good night, put on pajamas, and got into one of the beds. There was something hard inside the pillowcase. He groped inside it and pulled out a sticky purple-and-orange sweet, which he recognized as a Puking Pastille. Smiling to himself, he rolled over and was instantly asleep.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="海德薇在一个大衣柜顶上朝哈利高兴地叫了几声，然后便振翅飞出了窗外，哈利知道它一直在等着见他一面之后才去觅食。哈利向韦斯莱夫人道了晚安，换上睡衣上了一张床。枕头里有个硬东西，他把手伸进去一摸，掏出来一块黏糊糊的、一半紫色一半橘黄色的糖，他认出来了，是吐吐糖锭。他暗暗笑了笑，翻了个身，立刻睡着了。">查看中文翻译</div>
