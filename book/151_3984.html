<div class="line_en">For me, Halloween is the best holiday in the world. It even beats Christmas. I get to dress up in a costume. I get to wear a mask. I get to go around like every other kid with a mask and nobody thinks I look weird. Nobody takes a second look. Nobody notices me. Nobody knows me.</div>

<div class="line_en">When I was little, I used to wear an astronaut helmet everywhere I went. To the playground. To the supermarket. To pick Via up from school. Even in the middle of summer, though it was so hot my face would sweat. I think I wore it for a couple of years, but I had to stop wearing it when I had my eye surgery. I was about seven, I think. And then we couldn't find the helmet after that. Mom looked everywhere for it. She figured that it had probably ended up in Grans's attic, and she kept meaning to look for it, but by then I had gotten used to not wearing it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="小时候，我无论到哪儿都戴着一顶宇航员头盔。去操场戴着。去超市戴着。去学校接维娅也戴着。就算在盛夏季节，就算我热得汗流满面也戴着。我想我戴了好几年，但是做眼部手术时，我不得不将它取下来。我想那时我大约七岁。从那以后我们就找不到那顶头盔了。妈妈找遍了每一个角落。她觉得可能落在外婆的阁楼上了，她一直想找到它，不过那时我已经习惯不戴它了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This year I'm going to be Boba Fett: not Boba Fett the kid in Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones, but Boba Fett the man from Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back. Mom searched everywhere for the costume but couldn't find one in my size, so she bought me a Jango Fett costume -- since Jango was Boba's dad and wore the same armor -- and then painted the armor green. She did some other stuff to it to make it look worn, too. Anyway, it looks totally real. Mom's good at costumes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="今年我打算扮成波巴·费特：不是《星球大战II：克隆人的进攻》里的小波巴·费特，而是《星球大战V：帝国反击战》中的赏金猎人波巴·费特。妈妈到处寻找道具服，但都没有我穿的尺码，因此她买了一套姜戈·费特的道具服——因为姜戈是波巴的父亲，他们穿同样的盔甲——她把盔甲涂成了绿色。她还另外花了好多功夫把它做旧。不管怎么说，它看起来就跟真的一样。妈妈很会做衣服。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I have pictures of me in all my Halloween costumes. My first Halloween I was a pumpkin. My second I was Tigger. My third I was Peter Pan (my dad dressed up as Captain Hook). My fourth I was Captain Hook (my dad dressed up as Peter Pan). My fifth I was an astronaut. My sixth I was Obi-Wan Kenobi. My seventh I was a clone trooper. My eighth I was Darth Vader. My ninth I was the Bleeding Scream, the one that has fake blood oozing out over the skull mask.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我保留着所有穿着万圣节化妆服的照片。第一个万圣节，我扮成了一只南瓜；第二个万圣节，我成了跳跳虎；第三个万圣节，我成了彼得·潘（爸爸则装扮成了胡克船长）；第四个万圣节，我成了胡克船长（爸爸则装扮成了彼得·潘）；第五个万圣节，我打扮成了一个宇航员；第六个万圣节，我是欧比旺·肯诺比；第七个万圣节，我又成了克隆帝国风暴兵；第八个万圣节，我则扮成了达斯·维达；第九个万圣节，我扮成了一个骷髅幽灵，骷髅面具下有假血汩汩渗出来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In homeroom we all talked about what we were going to be for Halloween. Charlotte was going as Hermione from Harry Potter. Jack was going as a wolfman. I heard that Julian was going as Jango Fett, which was a weird coincidence. I don't think he liked hearing that I was going as Boba Fett.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在年级室里，大家都在谈论万圣节的化妆事宜。夏洛特打算扮成《哈利·波特》里的赫敏，杰克要打扮成狼人。一个诡异的巧合是，我听说朱利安想扮姜戈·费特。我觉得，如果他知道我要扮波巴·费特，一定会很不爽。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">On the morning of Halloween, Via had this big crying meltdown about something. Via's always been so calm and cool, but this year she's had a couple of these kinds of fits. Dad was late for work and was like, "Via, let's go! Let's go!" Usually Dad is super patient about things, but not when it comes to his being late for work, and his yelling just stressed out Via even more, and she started crying louder, so Mom told Dad to take me to school and that she'd deal with Via. Then Mom kissed me goodbye quickly, before I even put on my costume, and disappeared into Via's room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="万圣节那天早晨，维娅不知因为什么事情绪崩溃，大哭了一场。她一向沉着冷静，但是今年却已几度失控。爸爸上班快迟到了，正在大喊大叫：“维娅，快走！赶紧走了！”爸爸一向极有耐心，不过如果上班要迟到，情况就不一样了，他的叫喊只会让维娅更加焦虑不安，她索性放声大哭起来。于是妈妈叫爸爸送我去学校，她来对付维娅。妈妈匆匆忙忙地跟我吻别，我甚至还没穿上万圣节服装，她就已经到维娅的房间里去了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Auggie, let's go now!" said Dad. "I have a meeting I can't be late for!"</div>

<div class="line_en">I rushed to my room and started to put on the Boba Fett costume, but all of a sudden I didn't feel like wearing it. I'm not sure why -- maybe because it had all these belts that needed to be tightened and I needed someone's help to put it on. Or maybe it was because it still smelled a little like paint. All I knew was that it was a lot of work to put the costume on, and Dad was waiting and would get super impatient if I made him late. So, at the last minute, I threw on the Bleeding Scream costume from last year. It was such an easy costume: just a long black robe and a big white mask. I yelled goodbye from the door on my way out, but Mom didn't even hear me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我冲进自己房间，动手穿波巴·费特的道具服，但是突然我又不想穿了。我不确定到底是为什么——也许是因为需要绑太多带子，我需要有人帮忙才穿得上。或者是因为这套衣服还残留着颜料的味道。我只知道穿上它需要大费周章，而且爸爸又在等，如果我让他迟到，他会抓狂的。因此，在最后一刻，我匆匆穿上了去年的骷髅幽灵衣。这是一套简易的行头，就一件黑长袍和一个大大的白色面具。我出门的时候冲妈妈喊了一声“再见”，但是她完全没听见。">查看中文翻译</div>
