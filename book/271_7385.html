<div class="line_en">And then Seth's piercing howl broke the early morning quiet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在这样想着的时候，塞思刺耳的叫声划破了早晨的宁静。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I lurched up from the ground, my front legs pulling toward a sprint before my hind legs were off the ground. I raced toward the place where Seth had frozen, listening with him to the tread of paws running in our direction.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我立刻从地上跳起来，后腿还没完全离地，前腿就已经做出一个凌空腾跃的动作。我快马加鞭赶到Seth那里，他在那里紧张地一动都不敢动。我和他一起屏息凝神地听着朝我们方向接近的脚步声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The sun had risen behind the clouds an hour ago -- the forest was gray now instead of black. Seth'd curled up and passed out around one, and I'd woken him at dawn to trade off. Even after running all night, I was having a hard time making my brain shut up long enough to fall asleep, but Seth's rhythmic run was helping. One, two-three, four, one, two-three, four -- dum dum-dum dum -- dull paw thuds against the damp earth, over and over as he made the wide circuit surrounding the Cullens' land. We were already wearing a trail into the ground. Seth's thoughts were empty, just a blur of green and gray as the woods flew past him. It was restful. It helped to fill my head with what he saw rather than letting my own images take center stage.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一小时前，太阳从云层后面升了起来——森林现在笼罩在一片灰雾中，不再是漆黑一片。塞思蜷缩着睡了过去，他凌晨一点左右才睡下，所以我会在黄昏时刻叫醒他换班。即使在跑了一整夜后，我的脑袋都无法停止思想，所以辗转难眠，但是塞思颇有节奏的脚步倒是帮了忙。一，二—三，四，一，二—三，四，——咚咚咚当——脚掌踩在潮湿的泥土上产生的单调节奏，在他围着卡伦家领地巡视时，就这样一遍又一遍的播放着。塞思的思想几乎是空白的，能看见的只有他经过时，那些树木倒退所构成的绿色、灰色的斑驳色块，看着让人觉得放松。比起让自己的主观思想占据主导，看着他脑海中的画面，对睡眠更有帮助。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I listened carefully to the thoughts mixed in with the words. If this was a diversion or a ploy, I had to be alert enough to see through it. But there was nothing. Her declaration was nothing but the truth. Unwilling, almost despairing truth.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="她被我这样鲁莽的侵入激怒了。我总是对利亚拒之千里——因为从来都搞不懂她到底是怎么想的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That wasn't true. There was an edgy kind of excitement in her mind. She was unhappy about this, but she was also riding some weird high. I searched her mind, trying to understand.</div>
