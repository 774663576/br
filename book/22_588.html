<div class="line_en">I think: Sue's aunt! I was sorry for her, once. Now I turn and almost spit at her. "Will you keep from me, you witch?" The kitchen grows silent. It seems darker, too, and close. I still have Richard gripped by the waistcoat. When he tries to pull away, I hold him tighter. My thoughts are leaping, fast as hares. I think, He has married me, and has brought me here, as a place to be rid of me. He means to keep my money for himself. He means to give them some trifling share for the killing of me, and Sue -- even in the midst of my shock and confusion, my heart drops again, as I think it -- Sue they will free. Sue knows it all.</div>

<div class="line_en">The boy's knife flashes again. Now, I think, they will kill me. The thought itself is like a blade, and astonishingly sharp. For haven't I willed my life away, at Briar? Haven't I felt it rising from me, and been glad? Now I suppose they mean to kill me; and I am more afraid than I have imagined it possible to be, of anything, anything at all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那少年的刀又闪了一下。现在，我心想，他们要干掉我了。这念头本身就好象一片刀片，刀刃之锋利触目惊心。我不是在布莱尔就已将生死置之度外了吗？我不是已感觉到生命重获蘖磐，并为此深感庆幸吗？现在，我猜他们要干掉我；我设想过各种可能，一切情形，但事到临头，我却比想象中更为恐惧。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Damn you!" I say. I look wildly about me for a moment, then make a sudden grab at my bag. Richard reaches it first, however, he hooks it with his long leg and kicks it across the floor, almost playfully. The boy takes it up, and holds it in his lap. He produces a knife and begins to pick at the lock. The blade flashes. Richard folds his arms. "You see you cannot leave, Maud," he says simply. "You cannot go, with nothing."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你该死！”我说道。我目光狂乱，环顾身边，然后突然扑向我的包。然而，理查德抢先够到那包，他长腿一勾，再踢出一脚，简直象玩游戏，包在地板上滑过去。那少年拿到包，将包搁在膝盖上。他变出把匕首，开始撬包上的锁。刀片闪着光。理查德抱着胳膊。“你看你走不成了，莫德。”他简洁地说道。“两手空空，走不了了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="你这个傻瓜，我对自己说。不过对他们，我说道：“你们休想！你们休想！”我抬脚左冲右突，声东击西，最后象飞镖一样飞身扑去，不是扑向理查德身后的门，而是那个昏睡的大脑袋婴儿。我抓住孩子，拿在手里晃着，还将手放在孩子脖颈上。">查看中文翻译</div>

She moves her hand, makes a face. "I never bothered with that. That was out of my line. My idea was, if it wasn't going to kill you on its way out, then have it, and sell it; or what's better, give it to me and let me sell it for you! -- I mean, to people that want infants, for servants or apprentices, or for regular sons and daughters. Did you know, dear girl, that there were people in the world, like that? -- and people like me, providing the infants? No?" Again, I make no answer. Again she moves her hand. "Well, perhaps this lady I am speaking of now didn't know it either, till she came to me. Poor thing. The Borough woman had tried to help her, but she was too far on, she had only got sick. "Where's your husband?" I said, before I took her in. "Where's your ma? Where's all your people? Won't follow you here, will they?" She said they wouldn't. She had no husband -- that was her trouble, of course. Her mother was dead. She had run away from a great, grand house, forty miles from London -- up-river, she said…" She nods, still keeping her eyes on mine. I have grown colder than ever. "Her father and her brother were looking for her, and seemed likely to just about kill her; but would never find their way to the Borough, she swore it. As for the gentleman that had started her troubles all off, by saying he loved her -- well, he had a wife and a kiddie of his own, and had given her up as ruined, and washed his hands. -- As gentlemen, of course, will do."</div>

That child was everything to her, and when I said she had much better give her up to me, than keep her, she grew quite wild. "What, you don't mean to raise her yourself?" I said. "You, a lady, without a husband?" She said she would pass herself off as a widow -- meant to go abroad, where no-one knew her, and make her living as a seamstress. "I'll see my daughter married to a poor man before she knows my shame," she said. "I'm through with the quality life." That was her one thought, poor thing, that no amount of sensible talking from me could shake her of: that she would sooner see her girl live low but honest, than give her back to the world of money she come from. She meant to start for France so soon as her strength was all back -- and I'll tell you this now, I thought she was a fool; but I would have cut my own arm to help her, she was that simple and good."</div>

Still she talked, all the time, of France, it was all she thought of; until one night, I was putting her into her bed when there comes a knocking on our kitchen door. It's the woman, from the Borough, what first put her on to me: I see her face, and know there's trouble. There is. What do you think? The lady's pa and brother have tracked her down after all. "They're coming," says the woman. "Lord help me, I never meant to tell them where you was; but the brother had a cane, and whipped me." She shows me her back, and it's black. "They've gone for a coach," she says, "and a bully to help them. I should say you've an hour. Get your lady out now, if she means to go. Try to hide her and they'll pull your house apart!" "Well!" The poor lady had followed me down and heard it all, and started shrieking. "Oh, I'm done for!" she said. "Oh, if I might only have got to France!" -- but the trip downstairs had half-killed her, she was so weak. "They'll take my baby!" she said. "They'll take her and make her theirs! They'll put her in their great house, they might as well lock her into a tomb! They'll take her, and turn her heart against me -- oh! and I haven't even named her! I haven't even named her!" That's all she would say. "I haven't even named her!" -- "Name her now, then!" I said, just to make her be quiet. "Name her quick, while you still got the chance." "I will!" she said. "But, what name shall I give her?" "Well," I said, "think on: she's to be a lady after all, there's no helping it now. Give her a name that'll fit her. What's your own name? Give her that."

<div class="line_en">Perhaps there is movement in the room below, in the street -- I do not know, I do not hear it if there is. I keep my gaze on Mrs Sucksby's flushed face, on her eyes, her lips.-- "Now, here was a thing," she is saying, "to be asked to do. Wouldn't you say, dear girl? Here was a thing, all right. I think I never thought harder or quicker before in all my life. And what I said at last was: "Keep your money. Keep your fifty pounds. I don't want it. What I want, is this: Your pa is a gentleman, and gents are tricky. I'll keep your baby, but I want for you to write me out a paper, saying all you mean to do, and signing it, and sealing it; and that makes it binding." "I'll do it!" she says, straight off. "I'll do it!" And we come in here, and I fetch her a bit of paper and ink, and she sets it all down -- just as I have told you, that Susan Lilly is her own child, though left with me, and that the fortunes are to be cut, and so on -- and she folds it and seals it with the ring off her finger, and puts on the front that it ain't to be opened till the day her daughter turns eighteen. Twenty-one, she wanted to make it: but my mind was running ahead, even as she was writing, and I said it must be eighteen -- for we oughtn't to risk the girls taking husbands, before they knew what was what." She smiles. "She liked that. She thanked me for it. And then, no sooner had she sealed it than Mr Ibbs sends up a cry: there's a coach, pulled up at his shop door, with two gents -- an old one, and a younger -- getting out, and with them, a bully with a club. Well! The lady runs shrieking to her room and I stand, tearing the hair out of my head. Then I go to the cribs, and I fetch up this one particular baby that is there -- a girl, same size as the other, looks to turn out fair, like her -- and I carry her upstairs. I said, "Here! Take her quick, and be kind to her! Her name's Maud; and that's a name for a lady after all. Remember your word." "Remember yours! the poor girl cries; and she kisses her own baby, and I take it, and bring it down and lay it in the empty cot…"</div>

For now her pa and her brother, having got her home, made her change her will. -- You can guess what to. No penny to go to the daughter -- meaning you, dear girl, so far as they knew -- till the daughter marries. There's gentlemen for you -- ain't it. She sent me a note to tell me, by a nurse. They'd got her into the madhouse by then, and you alongside her -- well, that soon finished her off.
