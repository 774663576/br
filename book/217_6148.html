<div class="line_en">As soon as we reckoned everybody was asleep that night we went down the lightning-rod, and shut ourselves up in the lean-to, and got out our pile of fox-fire, and went to work. We cleared everything out of the way, about four or five foot along the middle of the bottom log. Tom said we was right behind Jim's bed now, and we'd dig in under it, and when we got through there couldn't nobody in the cabin ever know there was any hole there, because Jim's counterpin hung down most to the ground, and you'd have to raise it up and look under to see the hole. So we dug and dug with the case-knives till most midnight; and then we was dog-tired, and our hands was blistered, and yet you couldn't see we'd done anything hardly. At last I says:</div>

If we was prisoners it would, because then we'd have as many years as we wanted, and no hurry; and we wouldn't get but a few minutes to dig, every day, while they was changing watches, and so our hands wouldn't get blistered, and we could keep it up right along, year in and year out, and do it right, and the way it ought to be done. But WE can't fool along; we got to rush; we ain't got no time to spare.

"Now you're talking!" I says; "your head gets leveler and leveler all the time, Tom Sawyer," I says. "Picks is the thing, moral or no moral; and as for me, I don't care shucks for the morality of it, nohow.

What I want is my nigger; or what I want is my watermelon; or what I want is my Sunday-school book; and if a pick's the handiest thing, that's the thing I'm a-going to dig that nigger or that watermelon or that Sunday-school book out with; and I don't give a dead rat what the authorities thinks about it nuther."</div>

Tom says it wasn't enough; but I said nobody wouldn't ever see the plates that Jim throwed out, because they'd fall in the dog-fennel and jimpson weeds under the window-hole – then we could tote them back and he could use them over again.

<div class="line_en">That night we went down the lightning-rod a little after ten, and took one of the candles along, and listened under the window-hole, and heard Jim snoring; so we pitched it in, and it didn't wake him. Then we whirled in with the pick and shovel, and in about two hours and a half the job was done. We crept in under Jim's bed and into the cabin, and pawed around and found the candle and lit it, and stood over Jim awhile, and found him looking hearty and healthy, and then we woke him up gentle and gradual. He was so glad to see us he most cried; and called us honey, and all the pet names he could think of; and was for having us hunt up a cold-chisel to cut the chain off of his leg with right away, and clearing out without losing any time. But Tom he showed him how unregular it would be, and set down and told him all about our plans, and how we could alter them in a minute any time there was an alarm; and not to be the least afraid, because we would see he got away, Sure. So Jim he said it was all right, and we set there and talked over old times awhile, and then Tom asked a lot of questions, and when Jim told him Uncle Silas come in every day or two to pray with him, and Aunt Sally come in to see if he was comfortable and had plenty to eat, and both of them was kind as they could be, Tom says:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当天晚上，我们在十点钟以后，顺着避雷针滑了下去。还顺手偷了一支蜡烛。我们在窗洞口一听，只听得杰姆在打呼噜，我们就一抬手把蜡烛扔了进去。可是这并没有弄醒杰姆。随后我们抡起镐头和铁铣猛干了起来，大约两个半钟点以后，大功便告成了。我们爬到了杰姆的床底下，这样进了小屋。摸了半天，才摸到了蜡烛，点了起来。我们在杰姆边上站了一会儿，见到他那样子还挺健旺。随后我们轻轻地、慢慢地把他推醒了。他见到我们，高兴得快要哭出来，叫我们乖乖、宝贝等等他能叫出来的种种亲热的称呼。他还要我们找一只凿子，把腿上的镣铐给打开，并且不要耽误时间，马上逃出去。不过汤姆对他说了为什么这样不合乎规矩。汤姆还坐了下来，详详细细讲了我们的计划的方方面面。还说明，万一情况有变，我们会怎样立时立刻对计划进行改动，完全不用害怕，因为准会想尽办法，确保他逃出去。杰姆便说这样很好。我们就坐在那里，谈了一阵过去的事，汤姆也提出了一些问题询问他。后来杰姆说，西拉斯姨父每隔一两天来一回，跟他一起作祷告，萨莉阿姨也来看他过得是不是舒服，吃得饱不饱，两人都和善得无以复加。汤姆说：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="我说，“这样可使不得，这种办法可是最笨不过的办法。”不过我的话他只当耳边风，还是他干他的。一旦主意已定，他就是按他的老路子办。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So he told Jim how we'd have to smuggle in the rope-ladder pie and other large things by Nat, the nigger that fed him, and he must be on the lookout, and not be surprised, and not let Nat see him open them; and we would put small things in uncle's coatpockets and he must steal them out; and we would tie things to aunt's apron-strings or put them in her apron-pocket, if we got a chance; and told him what they would be and what they was for. And told him how to keep a journal on the shirt with his blood, and all that. He told him everything. Jim he couldn't see no sense in the most of it, but he allowed we was white folks and knowed better than him; so he was satisfied, and said he would do it all just as Tom said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所以他就对杰姆说了我们准备怎样通过给他送吃食的黑奴纳特，把绳梯馅饼等等东西偷偷送进来，要他随时注意，千万不要大惊小怪。他打开这些东西时，别叫纳特看见。我们还打算把一些小玩意儿塞进西拉斯姨夫的口袋里，他务必把这些东西偷到手。我们还打算一有机会，把一些东西拴在萨莉阿姨的围裙带子上，或者放进围裙口袋里，还会设法告诉他，那是些什么东西，有什么用途。他还对杰姆说，该怎样在他的衬衫上，蘸着他自己的血写下日记，如此等等。他对他讲的这么多种种的事，杰姆多半听了莫名其妙，不过他承认，我们是白种人，懂得的比他多，因此他也就满意了。还说他一定一一按汤姆的话去做。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jim had plenty corn-cob pipes and tobacco; so we had a right down good sociable time; then we crawled out through the hole, and so home to bed, with hands that looked like they'd been chawed. Tom was in high spirits. He said it was the best fun he ever had in his life, and the most intellectural; and said if he only could see his way to it we would keep it up all the rest of our lives and leave Jim to our children to get out; for he believed Jim would come to like it better and better the more he got used to it. He said that in that way it could be strung out to as much as eighty year, and would be the best time on record. And he said it would make us all celebrated that had a hand in it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杰姆有的是玉米轴烟斗和烟叶子，因此我们在那里快快活活地聊了一阵，随后从洞中爬了出来，回屋里睡觉。两只手呢，磨破了好几处，乍一看，仿佛被什么东西啃过似的。汤姆兴高采烈，说这是他平生最开心也最用脑筋的一段时光。还说，只要他能想出个法子，我们便能一辈子干到老死，让儿辈把杰姆搭救出去。因为按照他的想法，杰姆会越来越习惯于这样的生活，也就越来越喜欢这样的生活。他说，这么一来，便可一拖拖到八十年，从而成为历史上的最高纪录。他还说，这能叫我们这些有关的人一律都成为赫赫有名的人物。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In the morning we went out to the woodpile and chopped up the brass candlestick into handy sizes, and Tom put them and the pewter spoon in his pocket. Then we went to the nigger cabins, and while I got Nat's notice off, Tom shoved a piece of candlestick into the middle of a corn-pone that was in Jim's pan, and we went along with Nat to see how it would work, and it just worked noble; when Jim bit into it it most mashed all his teeth out; and there warn't ever anything could a worked better. Tom said so himself. Jim he never let on but what it was only just a piece of rock or something like that that's always getting into bread, you know; but after that he never bit into nothing but what he jabbed his fork into it in three or four places first.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到早上，我们走出去，到了木材垛那边，把那座黄铜烛台砍成几小截，汤姆把这一些和一把锡镴调羹放进了自己的口袋。随后我们到了黑奴的小屋，由我把纳特的注意力引开，汤姆把一小截烛台塞在给杰姆送饭的锅里一块玉米饼中间。我们和纳特一块儿去小屋，看这办法灵不灵。果然这办法灵得很哩。杰姆一口咬下去，烛台几乎把他的牙给崩飞啦，世上恐怕没有比这更灵的办法了。汤姆就是这么说的。杰姆呢，他装做若无其事，仿佛只是吃到了一粒小石子之类的东西。你知道的，吃面包时往往难免会吃到小粒石子。不过，在这以后，杰姆吃东西时，总是先用叉子戳个三四处再吃。">查看中文翻译</div>

By jings, we forgot to fasten that lean-to door! The nigger Nat he only just hollered "Witches" once, and keeled over on to the floor amongst the dogs, and begun to groan like he was dying. Tom jerked the door open and flung out a slab of Jim's meat, and the dogs went for it, and in two seconds he was out himself and back again and shut the door, and I knowed he'd fixed the other door too.
