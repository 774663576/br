<div class="line_en">Eliza saw Altamont not as so many hills, buildings, people: she saw it in the pattern of a gigantic blueprint. She knew the history of every piece of valuable property -- who bought it, who sold it, who owned it in 1893, and what it was now worth. She watched the tides of traffic cannily; she knew by what corners the largest number of people passed in a day or an hour; she was sensitive to every growing-pain of the young town, gauging from year to year its growth in any direction, and deducing the probable direction of its future expansion. She judged distances critically, saw at once where the beaten route to an important centre was stupidly circuitous, and looking in a straight line through houses and lots, she said:</div>

<div class="line_en">In winter, the wind blew howling blasts under the skirts of Dixieland: its back end was built high off the ground on wet columns of rotting brick. Its big rooms were heated by a small furnace which sent up, when charged with fire, a hot dry enervation to the rooms of the first floor, and a gaseous but chill radiation to those upstairs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="冬天一来，冷风吹过南都旅馆，发出呼呼的声音。这所房子的后侧是用潮湿朽烂的旧砖作基础而建造起来的，高出了地面。所有大房间都靠一个小火炉供暖。屋里生起火以后，热气就会通到一楼的几个房间里，然后再通到楼上，等到那里也就变成了冷气。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Thus, she began to think of Dixieland. It was situated five minutes from the public square, on a pleasant sloping middle-class street of small homes and boarding-houses. Dixieland was a big cheaply constructed frame house of eighteen or twenty drafty high-ceilinged rooms: it had a rambling, unplanned, gabular appearance, and was painted a dirty yellow. It had a pleasant green front yard, not deep but wide, bordered by a row of young deep-bodied maples: there was a sloping depth of one hundred and ninety feet, a frontage of one hundred and twenty. And Eliza, looking toward the town, said: "They'll put a street behind there some day."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这么着，她开始盘算南都旅馆这块房产。这所旅馆坐落在离广场5分钟路程的一段舒适的斜坡上，两旁都是中产阶级居住的幢幢洋房及出租房屋。这是一幢巨大、结构简单的老房子，里面有18—20个房间，老式的天花板很高，通风比较好。这所房子看起来并不算很起眼，它的设计也很草率，呈现出三角阁楼的形状。墙面刷了黄色的涂料。在房前有一块绿油油的草坪，草长得虽不茂盛，但却十分宽阔。沿着院子种着一排粗壮的枫树。斜坡上的这座房子纵深有190英尺，沿街的这一面有120英尺长。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The place was for sale. Its owner was a middle-aged horse-faced gentleman whose name was the Reverend Wellington Hodge: he had begun life favorably in Altamont as a Methodist minister, but had run foul of trouble when he began to do double service to the Lord God of Hosts and John Barleycorn -- his evangelical career came to an abrupt ending one winter's night when the streets were dumb with falling snow. Wellington, clad only in his winter heavies, made a wild sortie from Dixieland at two in the morning, announcing the kingdom of God and the banishment of the devil, in a mad marathon through the streets that landed him panting but victorious in front of the Post Office. Since then, with the assistance of his wife, he had eked out a hard living at the boarding-house. Now, he was spent, disgraced, and weary of the town.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这座房子正在出售。房子的主人是个马面中年人，人称“尊敬的威灵顿·霍治”。 他的身世不错，一开始就在阿尔特蒙担任美以美会的牧师。可是后来他碰上了麻烦，因为他一面信仰上帝，一面信奉酒鬼约翰·巴历肯。他的传道之路在一个冬天之夜突然终止，当时街上铺着厚厚的积雪。凌晨两点的时候，威灵顿牧师只穿着一件冬衣，嘴里大声叫喊着从南都旅馆冲了出来，宣布天国的诞生，魔鬼的灭亡。他在大街上发疯似的进行马拉松式的长跑，最后气喘吁吁、得意扬扬地跑到邮局门前。后来在他老婆的协助下，只能靠出租房屋的租金勉强度日。现在他已经精疲力竭、名声扫地，对小城也厌倦了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Besides, the sheltering walls of Dixieland inspired him with horror -- he felt that the malign influence of the house had governed his own disintegration. He was a sensitive man, and his promenades about his estate were checked by inhibited places: the cornice of the long girdling porch where a lodger had hanged himself one day at dawn, the spot in the hall where the consumptive had collapsed in a hemorrhage, the room where the old man cut his throat. He wanted to return to his home, a land of fast horses, wind-bent grass, and good whisky -- Kentucky. He was ready to sell Dixieland.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此外，南都旅馆的外墙也激起了他的恐惧心理——他感到这幢房子散发出的邪气导致了他的没落。他这人天生敏感，在庭院里散步，常会遇到令他止步的情况：比如屋前长廊一角的檐口处，曾有位房客某天清晨吊死在那儿；过道里有一个地方，曾经有一位肺病患者口吐鲜血倒在那里；在某间客房里，曾经有一位老头拿刀子割断了自己的喉咙。现在，他巴不得返回老家去，那一块绿草骏马、美酒相伴的地方——肯塔基州。他决心把南都旅馆这幢房子卖掉。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In the young autumn when the maples were still full and green, and the migratory swallows filled secretly the trees with clamor, and swooped of an evening in a black whirlwind down, drifting at its funnel end, like dead leaves, into their chosen chimney, Eliza moved into Dixieland. There was clangor, excitement, vast curiosity in the family about the purchase, but no clear conception of what had really happened. Gant and Eliza, although each felt dumbly that they had come to a decisive boundary in their lives, talked vaguely about their plans, spoke of Dixieland evasively as "a good investment," said nothing clearly. In fact, they felt their approaching separation instinctively: Eliza's life was moving by a half-blind but inevitable gravitation toward the centre of its desire -- the exact meaning of her venture she would have been unable to define, but she had a deep conviction that the groping urge which had led her so blindly into death and misery at Saint Louis had now impelled her in the right direction. Her life was on the rails.</div>

<div class="line_en">She had promised herself to a young South Carolinian, who was connected rather vaguely with the grocery trade. His hair was parted in the middle of his low forehead, his voice was soft, drawling, amiable, his manner hearty and insistent, his habits large and generous. He brought Gant cigars on his visits, the boys large boxes of assorted candies. Every one felt that he had favorable prospects.</div>

<div class="line_en">Thus, before he was eight, Eugene gained another roof and lost forever the tumultuous, unhappy, warm centre of his home. He had from day to day no clear idea where the day's food, shelter, lodging was to come from, although he was reasonably sure it would be given: he ate wherever he happened to hang his hat, either at Gant's or at his mother's; occasionally, although infrequently, he slept with Luke in the sloping, alcoved, gabled back room, rude with calcimine, with the high drafty steps that slanted to the kitchen porch, with the odor of old stacked books in packing-cases, with the sweet orchard scents. There were two beds; he exulted in his unaccustomed occupancy of an entire mattress, dreaming of the day of manlike privacy. But Eliza did not allow this often: he was riven into her flesh.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就这样，还不到八岁的尤金又有了一处栖身之所，从今以后永远失去了那个喧闹、并不快乐、但在他心里却永远温暖的老家。日子一天一天地过去，他从不知道每天的吃住从哪里来，反正总会有人提供的。不管是在甘特那儿还是在伊丽莎那儿，他随便待在哪里就在哪里吃饭。有时候，他偶尔也和卢克同睡在房子后面那间斜屋顶的小阁楼里。小屋曾经草草地粉刷过，通风条件很好的楼梯直通底下厨房的门廊，空气中散发着旧箱子里书籍的霉味以及果园里果树的芬芳。这个小屋里共有两张床，他每次在这里睡觉时总要独占一张大床，并因此感到满心欢喜，梦想着有一天长成大人后，能够真正拥有自己的私人处所。但是伊丽莎很少允许他独自去那里睡觉：这个小儿子可是她的心头肉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As for the others -- Ben and Luke only -- they were left floating in limbo; for Steve, since his eighteenth year, had spent most of his life away from home, existing for months by semi-vagabondage, scrappy employment, and small forgeries upon his father, in New Orleans, Jacksonville, Memphis, and reappearing to his depressed family after long intervals by telegraphing that he was desperately sick or, through the intermediacy of a crony who borrowed the title of "doctor" for the occasion, that he was dying, and would come home in a box if he was not sent for in the emaciated flesh.</div>

All the boarders were very fond of her: they said she was a fine girl. Every one did. There was a spacious and unsparing generosity about her, a dominant consuming vitality, which ate at her poor health, her slender supply of strength, so that her shattered nerves drew her frequently toward hysteria, and sometimes toward physical collapse. She was almost six feet tall: she had large hands and feet, thin straight legs, a big-boned generous face, with the long full chin slightly adroop, revealing her big gold-traced upper teeth. But, in spite of this gauntness, she did not look hard-featured or raw-boned.

Eugene remembered the soft cool nights of summer, the assembled boarders and "I Wonder Who's Kissing Her Now," which Gant demanded over and over; "Love Me and the World Is Mine"; "Till the Sands of the Desert Grow Cold"; "Dear Old Girl, the Rob-BIN Sings Above You"; "The End of a Perfect Day"; and "Alexander's Rag-Time Band," which Luke had practised in a tortured house for weeks, and sung with thunderous success in the High School Minstrels.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the fresh Sunday morning air he marched off with brisk excitement to do duty at the altars, pausing near the church where the marshalled ranks of the boys' military school split cleanly into regimented Baptists, Methodists, Presbyterians.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在礼拜天早晨清新的空气里，他轻快、兴奋地出发，来到教堂履行圣坛前的任务。他会在教堂不远的地方停住脚步，注视军校里那些小伙子们按信仰——浸信会、卫理公会、长老会，排成一个个队列。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He felt now the petty cruelty of village caste. On Sunday for several years, he had bathed, brushed, arrayed his anointed body in clean underwear and shirting and departed, amid all the pleasurable bustle of Sunday morning, for the Presbyterian Sunday School. He had by this time been delivered from the instruction of the several spinsters who had taught his infant faith the catechism, the goodness of God, and the elements of celestial architecture. The five-cent piece which formerly he had yielded up reluctantly, thinking of cakes and ale, he now surrendered more gladly, since he usually had enough left over for cold gaseous draughts at the soda-fountain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在，他开始明白了村寨般严酷的等级制度。在过去的几年里，每到星期天他都会洗澡、梳头、换上干净的内衣和汗衫，然后在周日舒适的阳光里离开家，兴冲冲地到长老会教堂去作祷告。现在他已经渐渐长大，已经不需要跟着那几位老姑娘一问一答地背诵经文、赞美上帝、了解天国了。从前他在教堂里手中攥着五分硬币，不大情愿地捐献出来时，心里想要是拿这钱买蛋糕和啤酒该多好。可是现在，他可以非常爽快地把钱捐出来了。由于他身上通常都会有零花钱，他可以到冷饮店去畅饮一杯冰凉的汽水。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The children assembled in a big room adjacent to the church, honey-combed to right and left with small classrooms, which they entered after the preliminary service was finished. They were exhorted from the platform by the superintendent, a Scotch dentist with a black-gray beard, fringed by a small area of embalmed skin, whose cells, tissues, and chemical juices seemed to have been fixed in a state of ageless suspension, and who looked no older from one decade to another.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="孩子们在教堂旁边一间大房子里集合，房子左右两侧隔出一间一间的小教室。等做完礼拜后，他们就会分队走进各自的小教室。做礼拜的时候，一位苏格兰牙医站在台上向他们讲道。他是这里的督学，长着花白胡须，下颌周围的皮肤像被化学药水浸过一样，其细胞、组织、水分似乎永远不变，永不衰老。尽管10年、20年已经过去了，但他看上去并不显老。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He read the text, or the parable of the day's study, commented on it with Cæsarean dryness and concision, and surrendered the service to his assistant, a shaven, spectacled, Wilsonian-looking man, also Scotch, who smiled with cold affection at them over his high shiny collar, and led them through the verses of a hymn, heaving up his arms and leering at them encouragingly, as they approached the chorus. A sturdy spinstress thumped heavily upon a piano which shook like a leaf.</div>

<div class="line_en">He was now in a class composed entirely of boys. His teacher was a tall white-faced young man, bent and thin, who was known to all the other boys as secretary of the Y. M. C. A. He was tubercular; but the boys admired him because of his former skill as a baseball and basketball player. He spoke in a sad, sugary, whining voice; he was oppressively Christ-like; he spoke to them intimately about the lesson of the day, asking them what it might teach them in their daily lives, in acts of obedience and love to their parents and friends, in duty, courtesy, and Christian charity. And he told them that when they were in doubt about their conduct they should ask themselves what Jesus would say: he spoke of Jesus often in his melancholy, somewhat discontented voice -- Eugene became vaguely miserable as he talked, thinking of something soft, furry, with a wet tongue.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他所在的这个班全部由男孩子组成。老师是一个高大、瘦弱的年轻人，他的面容白净，经常驼着背，孩子们都知道他是YMCA（青年基督教会）的成员。他患有肺结核，可孩子们都佩服他，因为他原来曾是位优秀的棒球手，还是个篮球运动员。他说话的时候，声音里带有一种哀伤、甜蜜的味道，有点像悲哀的鸣叫声；他虔诚的精神态度会给人一种压迫感。他亲切地给大家讲解当天的课文，询问他们从课文里可以学到哪些与日常生活相关的教义，比如尊老爱幼、善待朋友、敬守本分、讲究礼貌、发扬博爱等。他还告诉大家，当你对自己的行为拿不准时，就问问自己的耶稣会怎么说。他三句话不离耶稣，语调哀婉而伤感。尤金一听他开口，就觉得有点难过，脑子里有一种软乎乎、毛茸茸的东西在蠕动，弄得他舌尖湿湿的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Eugene, during the week, never touched the lives of any of them, even in a remote way. His idea of their eminence was grossly exaggerated; the town had grown rapidly from a straggling village -- it had few families as old as the Pentlands, and, like all resort towns, its caste system was liquidly variable, depending chiefly upon wealth, ambition, and boldness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="整个星期，尤金从未搭理过他们中的任何人，甚至对他们敬而远之。其实他们的显赫地位并没有他想象中的那样崇高。不久前，这个小城还只是一个村子，现在倒发展得非常迅速。尽管如此，像彭特兰家这样的大户人家并不多见，而且，跟所有的度假胜地一样，这里的等级结构流动变化很大，主要根据人们的财富、雄心和胆量来确定。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry Tarkinton and Max Isaacs were Baptists, as were most of the people, the Scotch excepted, in Gant's neighborhood. In the social scale the Baptists were the most populous and were considered the most common: their minister was a large plump man with a red face and a white vest, who reached great oratorical effects, roaring at them like a lion, cooing at them like a dove, introducing his wife into the sermon frequently for purposes of intimacy and laughing, in a programme which the Episcopalians, who held the highest social eminence, and the Presbyterians, less fashionable, but solidly decent, felt was hardly chaste. The Methodists occupied the middle ground between vulgarity and decorum.</div>

<div class="line_en">This starched and well brushed world of Sunday morning Presbyterianism, with its sober decency, its sense of restraint, its suggestion of quiet wealth, solid position, ordered ritual, seclusive establishment, moved him deeply with its tranquillity. He felt concretely his isolation from it, he entered it from the jangled disorder of his own life once a week, looking at it, and departing from it, for years, with the sad heart of a stranger. And from the mellow gloom of the church, the rich distant organ, the quiet nasal voice of the Scotch minister, the interminable prayers, and the rich little pictures of Christian mythology which he had collected as a child under the instruction of the spinsters, he gathered something of the pain, the mystery, the sensuous beauty of religion, something deeper and greater than this austere decency.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在礼拜天的早晨，这里全都是衣冠整洁、庄重体面的长老会成员。他们做起事来循规蹈矩、举止高雅得体、分寸有度，气派高贵、安静沉着；教堂里仪式隆重、秩序井然、气氛庄严，这一切使尤金的心灵大受触动。他自愧与众不同，因为他切切实实地感到自己并没有融入这个世界。他只是每个星期从自己那个乌烟瘴气的环境来到这里，看上一眼马上就会离开。许多年来，他怀着一颗异乡人的心来这里参加礼拜。从教堂柔美、阴沉的声音里，从远处悦耳的风琴声中，从苏格兰牧师带有鼻音的讲道中，从无数次的祈祷中，从小时候老处女送给他、用于教导他的诸多基督教画片中，他领悟了宗教所涉及的痛苦、神秘和美感，这一切要比严谨的礼仪深刻得多、伟大得多。">查看中文翻译</div>
