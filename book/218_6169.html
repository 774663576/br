<div class="line_en">In 1995, I granted an interview with a newspaper in Singapore. The young female reporter was on time, and the interview got under way immediately. We sat in the lobby of a luxurious hotel, sipping coffee and discussing the purpose of my visit to Singapore. I was to share the platform with Zig Ziglar. He was speaking on motivation, and I was speaking on "The Secrets of the Rich."</div>

<div class="line_en">What this phrase means is that most people need only to learn and master one more skill and their income would jump exponentially. I have mentioned before that financial intelligence is a synergy of accounting, investing, marketing and law. Combine those four technical skills and making money with money is easier. When it comes to money, the only skill most people know is to work hard.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这句话的意思是说，大部分人需要学习并掌握不止一项技能，只有这样他们的收人才能获得显著增长。以前我提到过，财商是会计、投资、市场营销和法律等各方面能力的综合。将上述四种专业技能结合起来，以钱生钱就会容易得多。为了赚钱，只有一项技能的人只能努力工作。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The classic example of a synergy of skills was that young writer for the newspaper. If she diligently learned the skills of sales and marketing, her income would jump dramatically. If I were her, I would take some courses in advertising copywriting as well as sales. Then, instead of working at the newspaper, I would seek a job at an advertising agency. Even if it were a cut in pay, she would learn how to communicate in "short cuts" that are used in successful advertising. She also would spend time learning public relations, an important skill. She would learn how to get millions in free publicity. Then, at night and on weekends, she could be writing her great novel. When it was finished, she would be better able to sell her book. Then, in a short while, she could be a "best-selling author."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有关综合技能的典型例子就是那位为报纸撰稿的年轻作家。如果她能勤奋学习掌握市场及销售方面的技能，她的收入就会显著增加。要是换了我，我一定会去学习一些有关书籍的广告课程和销售方面的课程，然后，我将在一家广告公司找一份工作，而不是去报社。即使这样做会使收入降低，但我却能从那里学到在成功的广告中使用的“用几秒钟交流”的技巧。我还会花时间去学习公共关系这一重要技能，以便通过灵活的公共关系来赚取数百万美元。然后，在晚上或周末，去创作我的大作。所有这些都做到以后，我必定能使自己写的书畅销，并且，在短时间内，成为一位富有的“畅销书作家。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I am constantly shocked at how little talented people earn. I heard the other day that less than 5 percent of Americans earn more than $100,000 a year. I have met brilliant, highly educated people who earn less than $20,000 a year. A business consultant who specializes in the medical trade was telling me how many doctors, dentists and chiropractors struggle financially. All this time, I thought that when they graduated, the dollars would pour in. It was this business consultant who gave me the phrase, "They are one skill away from great wealth."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我常常吃惊为什么有些人才华过人却只挣到很低的收入，我听说只有不到5％的美国人年收人在10万美元以上。一位对药品贸易很精通的商务顾问曾经告诉我，有许多医生、牙医和按摩师在财务上困难重重。以前我总是以为他们一毕业，美元就会滚滚而来。这位商务顾问最后告诉了我一句话，“他们只有一项技能，所以他们挣不到大钱。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When I graduated from the U. S. Merchant Marine Academy in 1969, my educated dad was happy. Standard Oil of California had hired me for its oil-tanker fleet. I was a third mate, and the pay was low compared with my classmates, but it was OK for a first real job after college. My starting pay was about $42,000 a year, including overtime, and I only had, to work for seven months. I had five months of vacation. If I had wanted to, I could have taken the run to Vietnam with a subsidiary shipping company, and easily doubled my pay instead of taking the five J months' vacation.</div>

<div class="line_en">When I first came out with my first book If You Want To Be Rich and Happy, Don't Go to School? a publisher suggested I change the tide to The Economics of Education. I told the publisher that with a title like that, I would sell two books: one to my family and one to my best friend. The problem is, they would expect it for free. The obnoxious title If You Want To Be Rich and Happy, Don't Go to School? was chosen because we knew it would get tons of publicity. I am pro-education and believe in education reform. Otherwise, why would I continue to press for changing our antiquated educational system? So I chose a title that would get me on more TV and radio shows, simply because I was willing to be controversial. Many people thought I was a fruitcake, but the book sold and sold.</div>

Rich dad knew I would pick up "jargon" and a sense of what is important and what is not. I also worked as a bus boy and construction worker, as well as in sales, reservations and marketing.

<div class="line_en">In his book The Retirement Myth, Craig S. Karpel writes: I visited the headquarters of a major national pension consulting firm and met with a managing director who specializes in designing lush retirement plans for top management. When I asked her what people who don't have corner offices will be able to expect in the way of pension income, she said with a confident smile: The Silver Bullet. "What," I asked, "is The Silver Bullet?" She shrugged, 'If baby boomers discover they don't have enough money to live on when they're older, they can always blow their brains out. Karpel goes on to explain the difference between the old Defined Benefit retirement plans and the new 401K plans which are riskier. It is not a pretty picture for most people working today. And that is just for retirement. When medical fees and long-term nursing home care are added to the picture, the picture is frightening. In his 1995 book, he indicates that nursing-home fees run from $30,000 to $125,000 per year. He went to a clean no-frills nursing home in his area and found the price to be $88,000 a year in 1995.</div>

<div class="line_en">Personally, I take no sides because I can see the need for and the benefits of both sides. If you do as school recommends, become highly specialized, then seek union protection. For example, had I continued on with my flying career, I would have sought a company that had a strong pilots union. Why? Because my life would be dedicated to learn a skill that was valuable in only one industry. If I were pushed out of that industry, my life's skills would not be as valuable to another industry. A displaced senior pilot -- with 100,000 hours of heavy airline transport time, earning $150,000 a year -- would have a hard time finding an equivalent high-paying job in school teaching. The skills do not necessarily transfer from industry to industry, because the skills the pilots are paid for in the airline industry are not as important in, say, the school system.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="今天，我看到以前的学校教师现在每年能挣到数十万美元，他们能挣这么多是因为他们不仅在本专业拥有特长，而且也拥有其他方面的技能。他们既能教书，也能做销售和市场。我还不知道是否有比销售和市场更重要的技能，但掌握销售和市场技能对大部分人来说是困难的，这主要是因为他们害怕被拒绝。所以，你在处理人际交往、商务谈判和控制被拒绝时的恐慌心理方面做得越好，生活就会越轻松。就像我对那位想成为“畅销书作家”的女作家所建议的一样，我今天也给其他所有的人这个建议。在专业技能上非常精通既是优势也是弱点。我有许多朋友，他们非常有天赋，但他们不善于与其他人进行更多的交流去发挥他们的天赋，结果他们挣的钱少得可怜。我建议他们花一年时间来学习销售，即使什么也没挣到，可他们处理人际关系的能力会大大提高，而这种能力是无价的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">My educated dad always said, "When I have some extra money, I'll give it." The problem was, there was never any extra. So he worked harder to draw more money in rather than focus on the most important law of money: "Give and you shall receive." Instead, he believed in "Receive and then you give."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我那受过良好教育的爸爸总是说：“当我有多余的钱时，我就把它捐出来。”问题是他从来就没有多余的钱。因此他工作更加努力以挣到更多钱，却没有注意到一条最重要的金钱法则：“给予，然后获得”。相反，他却信奉“得到了然后再付出”。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In addition to being good learners, sellers and marketers, we need to be good teachers as well as good students. To be truly rich, we need to be able to give as well as to receive. In cases of financial or professional struggle, there is often a lack of giving and receiving. I know many people who are poor because they are neither good students nor good teachers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="除了成为好的学习者、销售者和市场营销者外，我们还需要成为好老师、好学生。要想真正富有，我们要能付出也要能得到。对于那些被财务或职业所困的人来说，他们常常既缺乏给予，也无力索取。我知道许多人之所以贫穷是因为他们既不是好教师也不是好学生。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Both of my dads were generous men. Both made it a practice to give first. Teaching was one of their ways of giving. The more they gave, the more they received. One glaring difference was in the giving of money. My rich dad gave lots of money away. He gave to his church, to charities, to his foundation. He knew that to receive money, you had to give money. Giving money is the secret to most great wealthy families. That is why there are organizations like the Rockefeller Foundation and the Ford Foundation. These are organizations designed to take their wealth and increase it, as well as give it away in perpetuity.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我的两个爸爸都是雄心勃勃的人，他们都把付出放在第一位。教学是他们付出的途径之一，他们付出的越多，得到的也越多。但一个明显的区别是对金钱的付出。我的富爸爸给予别人许多钱，他把钱捐给教堂、慈善机构以及他的基金会，他懂得如果想要得到金钱，就必须先付出金钱。付出金钱是那些非常富有的家庭保持财富的一个秘诀，这也是例如洛克菲勒基金会、福特基金会这样的机构存在的原因。建立这些机构是为了获取财富，通过定期付出财富再去增加更多的财富。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In conclusion, I became both dads. One part of me is a hard-core capitalist who loves the game of money making money. The other side is ': a socially responsible teacher who is deeply concerned with this ever-widening gap between the haves and have nots. I personally hold the archaic educational system primarily responsible for this growing gap.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="总之，我同时受到两个爸爸的影响。一方面我是资本主义的坚定信奉者，喜欢以钱生钱的游戏；另一方面我又是一个怀有社会责任感的教师，深深关注贫富之间日益加深的鸿沟。我个人认为，尚不完善的教育体系应对这一鸿沟的加深负有责任。">查看中文翻译</div>
