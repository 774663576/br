<div class="line_en">They were too overjoyed to hear him speak to answer for a while; nor did they understand his question. At length he gathered from Sam that they had seen nothing but the vague shadowy shapes coming towards them. Suddenly to his horror Sam found that his master had vanished; and at that moment a black shadow rushed past him, and he fell. He heard Frodo's voice, but it seemed to come from a great distance, or from under the earth, crying out strange words. They saw nothing more, until they stumbled over the body of Frodo, lying as if dead, face downwards on the grass with his sword beneath him. Strider ordered them to pick him up and lay him near the fire, and then he disappeared. That was now a good while ago.</div>

<div class="line_en">When he heard what Frodo had to tell, he became full of concern, and shook his head and sighed. Then he ordered Pippin and Merry to heat as much water as they could in their small kettles, and to bathe the wound with it. "Keep the fire going well, and keep Frodo warm!" he said. Then he got up and walked away, and called Sam to him. "I think I understand things better now," he said in a low voice. "There seem only to have been five of the enemy. Why they were not all here, I don't know; but I don't think they expected to be resisted. They have drawn off for the time being. But not far, I fear. They will come again another night, if we cannot escape. They are only waiting, because they think that their purpose is almost accomplished, and that the Ring cannot fly much further. I fear, Sam, that they believe your master has a deadly wound that will subdue him to their will. We shall see!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当他听见佛罗多的说词之后，他满腹忧虑的摇摇头，叹了口气。接着他命令皮聘和梅里利用小桶子尽可能的煮沸大量的水。“把火烧旺，让佛罗多保持温暖！”他说。然后他就站了起来，叫山姆跟过来。“我想我大概明白是怎么一回事了，”他压低声音说。“敌人似乎只有五名。我不知道他们为什么没有全员到齐，但我想他们没有意料到会遭到抵抗。他们暂时先撤退了，但恐怕并没有走多远。如果我们没办法及早离开，他们明晚还会攻击。因为他们认为任务已经快要完成了，而魔戒也跑不了多远，所以他们只是在等待。山姆，他们应该认为你的主人受的伤会让他听从他们的意志。我们走着瞧！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I am not a Black Rider, Sam," he said gently, "nor in league with them. I have been trying to discover something of their movements; but I have found nothing. I cannot think why they have gone and do not attack again. But there is no feeling of their presence anywhere at hand."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“山姆，我不是黑骑士，”他温柔的说，“也不是他们的盟友。我刚刚试着要找到他们的行踪，却什么都没有发现。我实在不明白为什么他们会离开，不再攻击。唯一可以确定的是附近没有任何他们出没的迹象。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Look!" he cried; and stooping he lifted from the ground a black cloak that had lain there hidden by the darkness. A foot above the lower hem there was a slash. "This was the stroke of Frodo's sword," he said. "The only hurt that it did to his enemy, I fear; for it is unharmed, but all blades perish that pierce that dreadful King. More deadly to him was the name of Elbereth."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你们看！”他弯身从地上捡起一件黑色的斗篷；之前因为夜色的关系没人看的见。斗篷边缘一尺左右的地方有条裂缝。“这是佛罗多宝剑留下的痕迹，”他说。“恐怕这是对敌人造成的唯一伤害，他的本体并未受伤，而所有穿过这恐怖之王的刀刃都会消融。伊尔碧绿丝的名讳对他可能还造成比较大的伤害。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Frodo dozed, though the pain of his wound was slowly growing, and a deadly chill was spreading from his shoulder to his arm and side. His friends watched over him, warming him, and bathing his wound. The night passed slowly and wearily. Dawn was growing in the sky, and the dell was filling with grey light, when Strider at last returned.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="佛罗多开始打盹；他可以感觉到肩膀上伤口的疼痛正缓缓的增加，那股要命的寒气从肩膀扩散到手臂和腰际。他的朋友看顾着他，试图保持他身体的温暖，不停的洗着他的伤口。夜色慢慢的消退，天边露出了曙光。在众人都笼罩在微明的天光时，神行客这才回来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sam choked with tears. "Don't despair!" said Strider. "You must trust me now. Your Frodo is made of sterner stuff than I had guessed, though Gandalf hinted that it might prove so. He is not slain, and I think he will resist the evil power of the wound longer than his enemies expect. I will do all I can to help and heal him. Guard him well, while I am away!" He hurried off and disappeared again into the darkness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山姆的泪水立刻夺眶而出。“不要放弃希望！”神行客说。“你必须相信我。你的佛罗多比我猜想的坚强多了，本来甘道夫提醒我的时候我还不相信。他并没有受到致命伤，而我猜想他能够抵抗这邪恶力量很久的时间。我会尽一切可能帮助他和医治他。我不在的时候看好他！”他急匆匆的消失在黑夜中。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"These leaves," he said, "I have walked far to find; for this plant does not grow in the bare hills; but in the thickets away south of the Road I found it in the dark by the scent of its leaves." He crushed a leaf in his fingers, and it gave out a sweet and pungent fragrance. "It is fortunate that I could find it, for it is a healing plant that the Men of the West brought to Middle-earth. Athelas they named it, and it grows now sparsely and only near places where they dwelt or camped of old; and it is not known in the North, except to some of those who wander in the Wild. It has great virtues, but over such a wound as this its healing powers may be small."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“就是这些叶子，”他说，“我走了很远才找到，因为这种植物并不会长在山坡上；而是生长在大道南方的树丛中。我靠着这叶子的气味才在黑暗中找到他。”他以手指将草叶揉碎，众人皆闻到一股甜美浓郁的香气。“幸好我找到了这种植物；这是西方皇族带来中土世界的药用植物之一。他们称它做‘阿夕拉斯’；现在只长在西方皇族曾经居住过或扎过营的地方。北方大多数的人都不知晓这种东西，只有那些经常在野外漫游的人会知道它的好处。它的药效极佳，但在这种伤口上可能看不出太大的效果。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"And more deadly to Frodo was this!" He stooped again and lifted up a long thin knife. There was a cold gleam in it. As Strider raised it they saw that near the end its edge was notched and the point was broken off. But even as he held it up in the growing light, they gazed in astonishment, for the blade seemed to melt, and vanished like a smoke in the air, leaving only the hilt in Strider's hand. "Alas!" he cried. "It was this accursed knife that gave the wound. Few now have the skill in healing to match such evil weapons. But I will do what I can."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“对佛罗多来说最要命的是这个！”他又弯下身，捡起一柄细长的薄刃小刀。上面泛着寒光。当神行客拿起这小刀时，他们都注意到刀刃在靠近刀柄的地方有块缺口。更惊人的是，这柄小刀就在他们眼前融化，化做一缕轻烟就这么消失在空气中。只剩下神行客手中的刀柄。“真糟糕！”他大喊着。“伤到佛罗多的是这柄被诅咒的武器。当世已经没有多少人可以医治这种要命的伤害了。我只能尽力一试。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He sat down on the ground, and taking the dagger-hilt laid it on his knees, and he sang over it a slow song in a strange tongue. Then setting it aside, he turned to Frodo and in a soft tone spoke words the others could not catch. From the pouch at his belt he drew out the long leaves of a plant.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他坐了下来，将刀柄放在膝盖上，开始用特殊的语言对它吟唱一段歌谣。接着他将刀柄拿开，开始对佛罗多呢喃着其它人听不见的话语。他接着从包包中掏出了某种植物的细长叶子来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The others were discussing this very question. They quickly decided to leave Weathertop as soon as possible. "I think now," said Strider, "that the enemy has been watching this place for some days. If Gandalf ever came here, then he must have been forced to ride away, and he will not return. In any case we are in great peril here after dark, since the attack of last night, and we can hardly meet greater danger wherever we go."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="其他人也正在讨论着这问题。他们很快的决定必须尽快离开风云顶。“我认为，”神行客说，“敌人已经监视这块地方好一段时间了。如果甘道夫曾经来过这里，他一定被逼走了，也不可能再回来。在昨天受到攻击之后，只要今天天黑时我们还待在这里，就会遭遇到极大的危险。我想不管到哪里，都不会比这边危险。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He threw the leaves into boiling water and bathed Frodo's shoulder. The fragrance of the steam was refreshing, and those that were unhurt felt their minds calmed and cleared. The herb had also some power over the wound, for Frodo felt the pain and also the sense of frozen cold lessen in his side; but the life did not return to his arm, and he could not raise or use his hand. He bitterly regretted his foolishness, and reproached himself for weakness of will; for he now perceived that in putting on the Ring he obeyed not his own desire but the commanding wish of his enemies. He wondered if he would remain maimed for life, and how they would now manage to continue their journey. He fell too weak to stand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他将揉碎的叶子丢进煮沸的水中，等稍凉之后用它来冲洗佛罗多的伤口。蒸汽所散发出来的气味让人神清气爽，身上没伤的人也觉得精神为之一振。这药草对于伤口的确有效，因为佛罗多可以感觉到疼痛和寒意都开始消退；但他的手臂依旧毫无知觉，也无法任意挥动。他开始后悔自己的愚行，认为这是意志力薄弱的后果。因为，当他戴上魔戒的那一刻，他并不是服从自己的欲望，而是遵照敌人的指示。佛罗多开始担心自己会不会终身成残，这趟旅程又要如何继续下去。他觉得自己双腿发软，根本站不起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They made their way slowly and cautiously round the south-western slopes of the hill, and came in a little while to the edge of the Road. There was no sign of the Riders. But even as they were hurrying across they heard far away two cries: a cold voice calling and a cold voice answering. Trembling they sprang forward, and made for the thickets that lay ahead. The land before them sloped away southwards, but it was wild and pathless; bushes and stunted trees grew in dense patches with wide barren spaces in between. The grass was scanty, coarse, and grey; and the leaves in the thickets were faded and falling. It was a cheerless land, and their journey was slow and gloomy. They spoke little as they trudged along. Frodo's heart was grieved as he watched them walking beside him with their heads down, and their backs bowed under their burdens. Even Strider seemed tired and heavy-hearted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一行人小心翼翼的绕过山丘的西南坡，不久之后就到了大道边。附近没有黑骑士的踪迹。但正当他们匆忙跨越大道时，他们听见了远处传来两声冰冷的呼喊声：一个冷若冰霜的声音呼喊、另一个则是作出回应。他们浑身发抖的冲向前，躲进对面的浓密植被中。眼前的地势一路向南倾斜，但却杂草丛生，没有任何的路径可以参考。空旷的草地之间生长着灌木丛和浓密的树林。此地的野草显得十分稀疏，病奄奄、灰噗噗的，树丛中的树叶也都开始变色。这块土地十分的萧瑟，他们的进程也又慢又陰郁。他们在这块土地上行走时彼此几乎不交谈。佛罗多看着伙伴们面露忧郁之色，背着沉重的包袱不停前进，心中感到非常的自责。连神行客都看起来都心情低落，步履疲倦。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As soon as the daylight was full, they had some hurried food and packed. It was impossible for Frodo to walk, so they divided the greater part of their baggage among the four of them, and put Frodo on the pony. In the last few days the poor beast had improved wonderfully; it already seemed fatter and stronger, and had begun to show an affection for its new masters, especially for Sam. Bill Ferny's treatment must have been very hard for the journey in the wild to seem so much better than its former life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="等到天色全明，他们就随便用了点早餐，急急忙忙的开始打包。佛罗多没办法走路，所以他们将大部分的行李分摊给每个人，让他坐上马背。在过去这几天以来，这可怜的动物已经康复许多，看起来它已经变得更胖、更强壮了，也开始对新的主人们产生情感。他和山姆之间的感情特别深厚。比尔这个混蛋之前一定用尽方法虐待它，才会让它在荒郊野外跋涉反而成了种休息。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They started off in a southerly direction. This would mean crossing the Road, but. it was the quickest way to more wooded country. And they needed fuel; for Strider said that Frodo must be kept warm, especially at night, while fire would be some protection for them all. It was also his plan to shorten their journey by cutting across another great loop of the Road: east beyond Weathertop it changed its course and took a wide bend northwards.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一行人立刻往南走，这代表着他们必须要越过大道。但这也是通往森林最快的路径。他们还需要额外的燃料，因为神行客说佛罗多必须随时随地保持温暖，而火焰也可以保护他们。他也准备再度走捷径，避开大道绕的一大段路。大道在风云顶西边的地方又往北弯，如果能够直接切过这个弯道，可以省下很多时间。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Before the first day's march was over Frodo's pain began to grow again, but he did not speak of it for a long time. Four days passed, without the ground or the scene changing much, except that behind them Weathertop slowly sank, and before them the distant mountains loomed a little nearer. Yet since that far cry they had seen and heard no sign that the enemy had marked their flight or followed them. They dreaded the dark hours, and kept watch in pairs by night, expecting at any time to see black shapes stalking in the grey night, dimly lit by the cloud-veiled moon; but they saw nothing, and heard no sound but the sigh of withered leaves and grass. Not once did they feel the sense of present evil that had assailed them before the attack in the dell. It seemed too much to hope that the Riders had already lost their trail again. Perhaps they were waiting to make some ambush in a narrow place?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在第一天的路程结束之前，佛罗多伤口的疼痛又开始慢慢增加，但他强忍了很久不愿说出口。又经过了四天，他们还是在这一片毫无生气的草地上走着，四周的景色几乎没有任何变化；唯一的改变是风云丘开始缓缓的消失在地平线后，而前方的山脉则是又靠近了些。自从多日前的叫喊声之后，他们就再也没有发现任何敌人的踪影，也不确定敌人是否继续跟踪他们的路线。他们十分害怕黑夜的降临，每天晚上都至少派出两人站哨，预料随时会看见黑影在月光下向他们扑来；但往往整夜只听见枯叶和低草摇动的叹息。他们完全没有感应任何如同当天突袭一样的邪恶之气。如果说黑骑士已经跟丢了，这又太过乐观了些。或许他们在某个狭窄的地方等着偷袭他们？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At the end of the fifth day the ground began once more to rise slowly out of the wide shallow valley into which they had descended. Strider now turned their course again north-eastwards, and on the sixth day they reached the top of a long slow-climbing slope, and saw far ahead a huddle of wooded hills. Away below them they could see the Road sweeping round the feet of the hills; and to their right a grey river gleamed pale in the thin sunshine. In the distance they glimpsed yet another river in a stony valley half-veiled in mist.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到了第五天快结束的时候，地势又再度缓缓上升，带着众人慢慢离开了之前所进入的低落谷地中。神行客现在又再度领着众人往东北方走。第六天他们终于走到了山坡顶，可以看见眼前一片宽广的森林和山丘，还有大道又再度出现在众人的眼前；右边则是一条在微弱陽光下反射着灰色光芒的河流。更远的地方则是另外一条穿越迷雾中山谷的河流。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Next day, early in the morning, they came down again to the borders of the Road. Sam and Strider went forward, but they found no sign of any travellers or riders. Here under the shadow of the hills there had been some rain. Strider judged that it had fallen two days before, and had washed away all footprints. No horseman had passed since then, as far as he could see.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天一早，他们就到了大道的边缘。山姆和神行客先上前打探，但没有看见任何旅客或是骑士的踪迹。在山丘的陰影之下有过下雨的痕迹，神行客判断大概是两天前的事情，也因此冲刷掉了所有的足迹。根据他的判断，从那之后就没有任何骑马的人经过这里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I am afraid we must go back to the Road here for a while," said Strider. "We have now come to the River Hoarwell, that the Elves call Mitheithel. It flows down out of the Ettenmoors, the troll-fells north of Rivendell, and joins the Loudwater away in the South. Some call it the Greyflood after that. It is a great water before it finds the Sea. There is no way over it below its sources in the Ettenmoors, except by the Last Bridge on which the Road crosses."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们恐怕必须要再回到大道上，”神行客说。“我们现在已经来到了狂吼河，也就是精灵们称做米塞塞尔的河流。它一路流到伊顿荒原，也就是瑞文戴尔北方，食人妖被击败之处，然后在南方和喧水河汇流。有些人从那里之后就称呼它为灰泛河。这条河在入海之前都相当的汹涌。从伊顿荒原以下完全没有办法横越这条河，只有大道经过的终末桥才能够越过这条河。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That is Loudwater, the Bruinen of Rivendell," answered Strider. "The Road runs along the edge of the hills for many miles from the Bridge to the Ford of Bruinen. But I have not yet thought how we shall cross that water. One river at a time! We shall be fortunate indeed if we do not find the Last Bridge held against us."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那就是喧水河，发源自瑞文戴尔的河流，”神行客回答。“大道过桥之后沿着山丘延伸许多哩才会来到布鲁南渡口。但我还没想到要怎么渡过那条河流。一次先解决一个问题吧！我只能先希望终末桥没有被人看守住就好了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

They dreaded to see black figures waiting there, but they saw none. Strider made them take cover in a thicket at the side of the Road, while he went forward to explore.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们尽可能的快速往前赶路，过了一两哩之后就看见了位在陡坡底的那座终末桥。他们很担心会看见黑色的身影站在桥上，在确认没有任何人在桥上之后，众人都松了一口气。神行客让他们躲在路旁的树丛中，自己先上前去一探究竟。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At once they went on again. They crossed the Bridge in safety, hearing no sound but the water swirling against its three great arches. A mile further on they came to a narrow ravine that led away northwards through the steep lands on the left of the Road. Here Strider turned aside, and soon they were lost in a sombre country of dark trees winding among the feet of sullen hills.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们当下就立刻出发。一行人安全的通过小桥，耳中只有河水冲刷在三根桥柱上的声音。又走了一哩之后，他们就发现有另一条往大道左边弯去的羊肠小径。神行客从这里走进森林中，很快的，众人都身陷在低矮山丘下众多林木的包围中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He held out his hand, and showed a single pale-green jewel. "I found it in the mud in the middle of the Bridge," he said. "It is a beryl, an elf-stone.

<div class="line_en">The hobbits were glad to leave the cheerless lands and the perilous Road behind them; but this new country seemed threatening and unfriendly. As they went forward the hills about them steadily rose. Here and there upon heights and ridges they caught glimpses of ancient walls of stone, and the ruins of towers: they had an ominous look. Frodo, who was not walking, had time to gaze ahead and to think. He recalled Bilbo's account of his journey and the threatening towers on the hills north of the Road, in the country near the Troll's wood where his first serious adventure had happened. Frodo guessed that they were now in the same region, and wondered if by chance they would pass near the spot.</div>

<div class="line_en">The hobbits grew very weary. They advanced slowly, for they had to pick their way through a pathless country, encumbered by fallen trees and tumbled rocks. As long as they could they avoided climbing for Frodo's sake, and because it was in fact difficult to find any way up out of the narrow dales. They had been two days in this country when the weather turned wet. The wind began to blow steadily out of the West and pour the water of the distant seas on the dark heads of the hills in fine drenching rain. By nightfall they were all soaked, and their camp was cheerless, for they could not get any fire to burn. The next day the hills rose still higher and steeper before them, and they were forced to turn away northwards out of their course. Strider seemed to be getting anxious: they were nearly ten days out from Weathertop, and their stock of provisions was beginning to run low. It went on raining.</div>

<div class="line_en">That night they camped on a stony shelf with a rock-wall behind them, in which there was a shallow cave, a mere scoop in the cliff. Frodo was restless. The cold and wet had made his wound more painful than ever, and the ache and sense of deadly chill took away all sleep. He lay tossing and turning and listening fearfully to the stealthy night-noises: wind in chinks of rock, water dripping, a crack, the sudden rattling fall of a loosened stone. He felt that black shapes were advancing to smother him; but when he sat up he saw nothing but the back of Strider sitting hunched up, smoking his pipe, and watching. He lay down again and passed into an uneasy dream, in which he walked on the grass in his garden in the Shire, but it seemed faint and dim, less clear than the tall black shadows that stood looking over the hedge.</div>

<div class="line_en">They decided to attempt the climb, but it proved very difficult. Before long Frodo was obliged to dismount and struggle along on foot. Even so they often despaired of getting their pony up, or indeed of finding a path for themselves, burdened as they were. The light was nearly gone, and they were all exhausted, when at last they reached the top. They had climbed on to a narrow saddle between two higher points, and the land fell steeply away again, only a short distance ahead. Frodo threw himself down, and lay on the ground shivering. His left arm was lifeless, and his side and shoulder felt as if icy claws were laid upon them. The trees and rocks about him seemed shadowy and dim.</div>

They found a passage between two hills that led them into a valley running south-east, the direction that they wished to take; but towards the end of the day they found their road again barred by a ridge of high land; its dark edge against the sky was broken into many bare points like teeth of a blunted saw.

Bill Ferny's poor old pony was developing an unexpected talent for picking out a path, and for sparing its rider as many jolts as possible. The spirits of the party rose again.

<div class="line_en">In the afternoon they went on down the woods. They were probably following the very track that Gandalf, Bilbo, and the dwarves had used many years before. After a few miles they came out on the top of a high bank above the Road. At this point the Road had left the Hoarwell far behind in its narrow valley, and now clung close to the feet of the hills, rolling and winding eastward among woods and heather-covered slopes towards the Ford and the Mountains. Not far down the bank Strider pointed out a stone in the grass. On it roughly cut and now much weathered could still be seen dwarf-runes and secret marks.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="佛罗多看着那石头，真希望比尔博带回来的不是这么引人注目、难以摧毁的宝藏。“他一定都没拿，”他说，“比尔博把它全送人了。他说因为这都是食人妖抢来的，他觉得不应该属于任何人。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Road lay quiet under the long shadows of early evening. There was no sign of any other travellers to be seen. As there was now no other possible course for them to take, they climbed down the bank, and turning left went off as fast as they could. Soon a shoulder of the hills cut off the light of the fast westering sun. A cold wind flowed down to meet them from the mountains ahead.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="傍晚时分，掩盖在林木陰影中的大道毫无人迹。由于别无他路，他们只得爬下山坡，往左转之后尽快的往前走。很快的，山丘就挡住了西沉落日的光芒。一阵冷风从前面的山脉吹了下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They were beginning to look out for a place off the Road, where they could camp for the night, when they heard a sound that brought sudden fear back into their hearts: the noise of hoofs behind them. They looked back, but they could not see far because of the many windings and rollings of the Road. As quickly as they could they scrambled off the beaten way and up into the deep heather and bilberry brushwood on the slopes above, until they came to a small patch of thick-growing hazels. As they peered out from among the bushes, they could see the Road, faint and grey in the failing light, some thirty feel below them. The sound of hoofs drew nearer. They were going fast, with a light clippety-clippely-clip. Then faintly, as if it was blown away from them by the breeze, they seemed to catch a dim ringing, as of small bells tinkling.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们正准备找个远离大道的地方，晚上可以扎营休息；突然间背后传来了唤醒所有人恐怖记忆的声音：马蹄声。众人不约而同的回过头，却由于沿路茂密的林木而看不清楚来客是谁。他们顾不得之前的工作，立刻连滚带爬的冲向山坡上可以掩蔽形迹的树丛。当他们隐藏好自己的身形之后，这才从树丛往外观察三十尺外大道上的动静。马蹄声越来越近，而且速度很急促，夹带着叮铃当啷的声音。然后，在微风吹拂下，众人似乎又听见了像是小铃当撞击的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The light faded, and the leaves on the bushes rustled softly. Clearer and nearer now the bells jingled, and clippety-clip came the quick trotting feet. Suddenly into view below came a white horse, gleaming in the shadows, running swiftly. In the dusk its headstall flickered and flashed, as if it were studded with gems like living stars. The rider's cloak streamed behind him, and his hood was thrown back; his golden hair flowed shimmering in the wind of his speed. To Frodo it appeared that a white light was shining through the form and raiment of the rider, as if through a thin veil.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="天色越来越暗，树丛中的树叶开始微微摇晃，发出细微的声响。铃当的声音越来越清楚，伴随着叮铃当啷的撞击声和急促的马蹄声。突然间，有匹白马彷佛流星一样的奔跑过众人眼前。在暮色中可以看见它的马笼头上点缀有许多亮晶晶的饰品，彷佛缀满了如同星辰一样的宝石。骑士的斗篷在他身后翻飞，褪下的兜帽让他的金发在空中舞动。在佛罗多的眼中，这骑士身体内似乎有种白光彷佛透过丝绸一般，隐隐的散放而出。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That does not sound like a Black Rider's horse!" said Frodo, listening intently. The other hobbits agreed hopefully that it did not, but they all remained full of suspicion. They had been in fear of pursuit for so long that any sound from behind seemed ominous and unfriendly. But Strider was now leaning forward, stooped to the ground, with a hand to his ear, and a look of joy on his face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这听起来可不像黑骑士的座骑！”佛罗多仔细的倾听着。其他的哈比人都满怀希望的同意他的说法，但还是心存疑惑，不敢轻易现身。他们被追杀的时间已经久到让他们草木皆兵、杯弓蛇影的地步了。但神行客现在则是趴在地面上，一手卷成杯状贴着泥土，脸上露出欢欣的表情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Strider sprang from hiding and dashed down towards the Road, leaping with a cry through the heather; but even before he had moved or called, the rider had reined in his horse and halted, looking up towards the thicket where they stood. When he saw Strider, he dismounted and ran to meet him calling out: Ai na vedui Dunadan! Mae govannen! His speech and clear ringing voice left no doubt in their hearts: the rider was of the Elven-folk. No others that dwelt in the wide world had voices so fair to hear. But there seemed to be a note of haste or fear in his call, and they saw that he was now speaking quickly and urgently to Strider.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="神行客跳了出来，冲向大道边，边大喊着吸引对方的注意。不过，在他采取任何行动之前，骑士就已经勒马止奔，朝着他们的方向看来。当他看见神行客的时候，他立刻下马，奔向他道：“Ai na vedui Dnadan！Mae govannen！”这清亮甜美的声音让众人再无疑惑，他是名精灵。这世界上再没有其它的生物能拥有这么动听的声音。但是，他们似乎从这呼唤中听见了慌张和恐惧，也注意到他正十万火急的和神行客说着话。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No. He had not when I departed; but that was nine days ago," answered Glorfindel. "Elrond received news that troubled him. Some of my kindred, journeying in your land beyond the Baranduin,* learned that things were amiss, and sent messages as swiftly as they could. They said that the Nine were abroad, and that you were astray bearing a great burden without guidance, for Gandalf had not returned. There are few even in Rivendell that can ride openly against the Nine; but such as there were, Elrond sent out north, west, and south. It was thought that you might turn far aside to avoid pursuit, and become lost in the Wilderness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“还没。在我出发的时候他还没到；不过，那已经是九天以前的事情了，”葛罗芬戴尔回答道。“爱隆收到一些让人很担心的消息。我们有些同胞踏进了巴兰督因河（注一）之后的区域，发现了情况不对劲，于是立刻把消息传过来。他们说九骑士已经出动了；而你们又在没有引导的状况下背负着重担远行；因为甘道夫没有回来。连瑞文戴尔之中都没有多少力量可以对抗九骑士；但爱隆派出了所有拥有足够能力的人往北、西、南方寻找你们的踪迹。我们担心你们可能为了躲避追捕而刻意绕路，迷失在荒野中。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It was my lot to take the Road, and I came to the Bridge of Mitheithel, and left a token there, nigh on seven days ago. Three of the servants of Sauron were upon the Bridge, but they withdrew and I pursued them westward. I came also upon two others, but they turned away southward. Since then I have searched for your trail. Two days ago I found it, and followed it over the Bridge; and today I marked where you descended from the hills again. But come! There is no time for further news. Since you are here we must risk the peril of the Road and go. There are five behind us, and when they find your trail upon the Road they will ride after us like the wind. And they are not all. Where the other four may be, I do not know. I fear that we may find the Ford is already held against us."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我的任务是沿着大路走，在七天以前的晚上于米塞塞尔桥上留下了一个记号。当时桥上有三名索伦的奴仆镇守着，我一路把他们赶往西边；路上又遇到了另外两名，但他们则是往南躲。从那之后，我就开始仔细搜寻你们留下的踪迹。两天前我找到了你们的足迹，跟着走上米塞塞尔桥；今天我又发现你们再度从丘陵区域进入了大路。先别提这些！我们没时间交换消息了。既然你们人在这里，我们就必须冒险从大道赶回去。我们身后有五名骑士在追赶；如果他们发现你们的踪迹，会像黑风一样的追来。而且，我们所面对的危险还不只这样，其他的四骑士在何处我们还不确定。我担心渡口可能已经被攻占了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"There are evil things written on this hilt," he said; "though maybe your eyes cannot see them. Keep it, Aragorn, till we reach the house of Elrond! But be wary, and handle it as little as you may! Alas! the wounds of this weapon are beyond my skill to heal. I will do what I can -- but all the more do I urge you now to go on without rest."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“刀柄上写着邪恶的咒文，”他说，“不过你可能看不见。阿拉贡，你先继续保管它，务必将它带到爱隆的住所去！千万小心，尽量不要碰触这东西！真糟糕！这刀所造成的伤害不是我能治的好的。我会尽量帮忙，但正因为这样，我必须请求你们不眠不休的赶路。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Briefly Strider told of the attack on their camp under Weathertop, and of the deadly knife. He drew out the hilt, which he had kept, and handed it to the Elf. Glorfindel shuddered as he took it, but he looked intently at it.</div>

Ever since the sun began to sink the mist before his eyes had darkened, and he felt that a shadow was coming between him and the faces of his friends. Now pain assailed him, and he felt cold. He swayed, clutching at Sam's arm.</div>

<div class="line_en">Glorfindel smiled. "I doubt very much," he said, "if your friends would be in danger if you were not with them! The pursuit would follow you and leave us in peace, I think. It is you, Frodo, and that which you bear that brings us all in peril."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="葛罗芬戴尔笑了。“我可不这么认为，”他说，“如果你不在他们身边，他们可能就不会遇到任何的危险！我想，对方应该会放过我们，直接把你当做目标。佛罗多，是你，和你身上所携带的宝物，让我们身陷危机。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You shall ride my horse," said Glorfindel. "I will shorten the stirrups up to the saddle-skins, and you must sit as tight as you can.

His pace is light and smooth; and if danger presses too near, he will bear you away with a speed that even the black steeds of the enemy cannot rival."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你最好骑我的马，”葛罗芬戴尔说。“我会把马镫收到马鞍边，你必须尽可能的夹紧双腿。不过，你也不用害怕，我的座骑绝不会让任何我令它搭载的骑士落马。它的步伐很轻、很快，如果危机靠近，它会以连黑骑士的座骑都追不上的神速带你逃离。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He searched the wound on Frodo's shoulder with his fingers, and his face grew graver, as if what he learned disquieted him. But Frodo felt the chill lessen in his side and arm; a little warmth crept down from his shoulder to his hand, and the pain grew easier. The dusk of evening seemed to grow lighter about him, as if a cloud had been withdrawn. He saw his friends' faces more clearly again, and a measure of new hope and strength returned.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他用手指摸索着佛罗多肩膀上的伤口，表情越来越凝重，他所发现的状况彷佛让他变得更加不安。不过，佛罗多却觉得刺骨的寒意开始慢慢消退，一点暖意从他的肩膀流入到他的手臂，疼痛也减轻了些。四周的环境似乎也变得清晰了一点，云雾似乎被某种力量抽走了。在他眼中，朋友的面孔变得更清楚了些，他开始觉得体内充满了新希望和新力量。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They cast themselves down in the heather a few yards from the road-side, and fell asleep immediately. They seemed hardly to have closed their eyes when Glorfindel, who had set himself to watch while they slept, awoke them again. The sun had now climbed far into the morning, and the clouds and mists of the night were gone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们一伙人精疲力尽，倒在路旁几码外的树丛中，几乎立刻就睡着了。葛罗芬戴尔则是自顾自的坐在旁边不睡，替大家站哨。当他叫醒大家的时候，众人觉得才刚阖眼一般，浑身依旧非常酸痛。太陽现在已经高高挂在天空，昨夜的雾气和云朵也全都散去了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">To that Frodo had no answer, and he was persuaded to mount Glorfindel's white horse. The pony was laden instead with a great part of the others' burdens, so that they now marched lighter, and for a time made good speed; but the hobbits began to find it hard to keep up with the swift tireless feet of the Elf. On he led them, into the mouth of darkness, and still on under the deep clouded night. There was neither star nor moon. Not until the grey of dawn did he allow them to halt. Pippin, Merry, and Sam were by that time nearly asleep on their stumbling legs; and even Strider seemed by the sag of his shoulders to be weary. Frodo sat upon the horse in a dark dream.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="佛罗多并没有回答，他最后终于被说服坐上葛罗芬戴尔的白马。于是他们将大部分的行李放到小马身上，众人走起来都轻松多了，一开始的速度快多了；不过，过了不久之后，他们就发现自己很难跟上精灵那永不疲倦的步伐。他领着众人走进扑天盖地的黑暗中。天上没有星辰也没有月亮，一直到了天亮之后，他才让一行人停下脚步。皮聘、梅里和山姆到了那个时候都已经快要站着睡着了；连神行客看起来都有些弯腰驼背、面露疲色。佛罗多坐在马背上，彷佛陷入黑暗的睡梦中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Drink this!" said Glorfindel to them, pouring for each in turn a little liquor from his silver-studded flask of leather. It was clear as spring water and had no taste, and it did not feel either cool or warm in the mouth; but strength and vigour seemed to flow into all their limbs as they drank it. Eaten after that draught the stale bread and dried fruit (which was now all that they had left) seemed to satisfy their hunger better than many a good breakfast in the Shire had done.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“喝下这个！”葛伦芬戴尔从他腰间的镶银皮水壶中倒给每人一小杯饮料。这东西清澈的像是山泉水，无色无味，在嘴中完全没有冰凉或是温暖的感觉；但一种新生的活力立刻开始涌入他们的全身。在喝了这神奇的饮料之后，他们仅剩的走味面包和干果似乎成为难得的珍馐美味，比夏尔的宴席还要让人满意。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But however anxious their guides might be, it was plain that the hobbits could go no further that night. They were stumbling along dizzy with weariness, and unable to think of anything but their feet and legs. Frodo's pain had redoubled, and during the day things about him faded to shadows of ghostly grey. He almost welcomed the coming of night, for then the world seemed less pale and empty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，不管他们的向导有多么着急，当晚这些哈比人都再也走不动路了。到最后他们都变得步履踉跄，满脑子只能想着赶快休息。佛罗多的疼痛又加倍了，白天在他的视线中变得一片灰白。他几乎开始喜欢上降临的夜色，因为在夜色中看来一切反而没有那么孤寂苍白。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The hobbits were still weary, when they set out again early next morning. There were many miles yet to go between them and the Ford, and they hobbled forward at the best pace they could manage.</div>

<div class="line_en">They had rested rather less than five hours when they took to the Road again. Glorfindel still urged them on, and only allowed two brief halts during the day's march. In this way they covered almost twenty miles before nightfall, and came to a point where the Road bent right and ran down towards the bottom of the valley, now making straight for the Bruinen. So far there had been no sign or sound of pursuit that the hobbits could see or hear; but often Glorfindel would halt and listen for a moment, if they lagged behind, and a look of anxiety clouded his face. Once or twice he spoke to Strider in the elf-tongue.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们休息不到五个小时之后就继续上路了。葛罗芬戴尔丝毫不敢松懈，一路催促大家赶路，只有两次在路旁稍做休息。靠着如此日夜兼程的急行军方式，他们在天黑前就赶了二十哩路，大道现在右转进入了一个谷地，直直朝向布鲁南渡口而去。到目前为止，哈比人都没有发现任何追兵的踪迹或身影；但葛罗芬戴尔却常常停下脚步，仔细倾听着后方的动静。如果他们脚步稍稍减缓，他的脸上就会出现愁容。中间有一两次他还用精灵语和神行客交谈了几句。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Road was still running steadily downhill, and there was now in places much grass at either side, in which the hobbits walked when they could, to ease their tired feet. In the late afternoon they came to a place where the Road went suddenly under the dark shadow of tall pine-trees, and then plunged into a deep cutting with steep moist walls of red stone. Echoes ran along as they hurried forward; and there seemed to be a sound of many footfalls following their own. All at once, as if through a gate of light, the Road ran out again from the end of the tunnel into the open. There at the bottom of a sharp incline they saw before them a long flat mile, and beyond that the Ford of Rivendell. On the further side was a steep brown bank, threaded by a winding path; and behind that the tall mountains climbed, shoulder above shoulder, and peak beyond peak, into the fading sky.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大道依旧持续的缓降下坡，两旁的草地也变得茂盛许多；哈比人有时刻意走在草地上，好让疲倦的双脚舒服些。到了下午的时候，他们走到一块被松林所包围的区域，大道在此深入两边都被红色岩石所包围的隧道中。当他们急忙向前的时候，许多脚步声在隧道中回响，让人开始疑神疑鬼。接着，毫无预警的，这道路就来到了开阔的平原上。他们可以看见前方是一望无际的平坦大地，一段距离以外就是瑞文戴尔渡口。在更远的地方则是褐色的陡坡，上面妆点着几条曲折的小径；在那之后则是一路高耸入云，峰峰相连的高山。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was still an echo as of following feet in the cutting behind them; a rushing noise as if a wind were rising and pouring through the branches of the pines. One moment Glorfindel turned and listened, then he sprang forward with a loud cry.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，他们身后传来了诡异的回声，彷佛之前的脚步声还没有消失一般。同时松树也开始摇晃起来，似乎有强风快速的从后方吹来。葛罗芬戴尔转头看了片刻，立刻奋力冲向前，口中大喊着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The white horse leaped forward. The hobbits ran down the slope. Glorfindel and Strider followed as rear-guard. They were only half way across the flat, when suddenly there was a noise of horses galloping. Out of the gate in the trees that they had just left rode a Black Rider. He reined his horse in, and halted, swaying in his saddle. Another followed him, and then another; then again two more.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="白色的骏马立刻放开四蹄往前奔驰。哈比人们立刻快速的跳下斜坡，葛罗芬戴尔和神行客负责殿后。眼前的平原还没走到一半，身后就传来了马匹急驰的声响。从树林中冲出一名黑骑士，他勒住缰绳停了下来，身体摇晃了几下。接着出现了另一名骑士，然后是另一名，另外两名则是最后才出现。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He did not obey at once, for a strange reluctance seized him. Checking the horse to a walk, he turned and looked back. The Riders seemed to sit upon their great steeds like threatening statues upon a hill, dark and solid, while all the woods and land about them receded as if into a mist. Suddenly he knew in his heart that they were silently commanding him to wait. Then at once fear and hatred awoke in him. His hand left the bridle and gripped the hilt of his sword, and with a red flash he drew it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他并没有立刻照做，因为有种奇异的渴望拖住了他。他让白马放慢脚步，转头看着背后。骑士们坐在黑色的骏马上，如同黑色的雕像一般睥睨山丘下的众人，他们完全不把四周所有的森林和山坡放在眼里。佛罗多的手离开缰绳，从腰间掏出带着红光的宝剑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At once the white horse sprang away and sped like the wind along the last lap of the Road. At the same moment the black horses leaped down the hill in pursuit, and from the Riders came a terrible cry, such as Frodo had heard filling the woods with horror in the Eastfarthing far away. It was answered; and to the dismay of Frodo and his friends out from the trees and rocks away on the left four other Riders came flying. Two rode towards Frodo: two galloped madly towards the Ford to cut off his escape. They seemed to him to run like the wind and to grow swiftly larger and darker, as their courses converged with his.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="白色神驹立刻一跃而起，如同狂风一般扫过平坦的大道。同一瞬间，黑骑士们策马奔下山坡，开始急起直追；骑士发出了一声凄厉的叫喊声，就正是当初他在夏尔东区所听到的那种撕心裂肺的恐怖声响。接下来的状况让众人措手不及：四名骑士从左方的树林和岩石间跃出，两名试着阻挡佛罗多的去路，另两名则奔向渡口，准备充当最后的防线。在佛罗多的眼中，朝他急驰过来的黑马和骑士似乎越变越大，越来越黑暗，而双方的路线不久之后就将交会。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Frodo looked back for a moment over his shoulder. He could no longer see his friends. The Riders behind were falling back: even their great steeds were no match in speed for the white elf-horse of Glorfindel. He looked forward again, and hope faded. There seemed no chance of reaching the Ford before he was cut off by the others that had lain in ambush. He could see them clearly now: they appeared to have cast aside their hoods and black cloaks, and they were robed in white and grey. Swords were naked in their pale hands; helms were on their heads. Their cold eyes glittered, and they called to him with fell voices.</div>

<div class="line_en">Frodo heard the splash of water. It foamed about his feet. He felt the quick heave and surge as the horse left the river and struggled up the stony path. He was climbing the steep bank. He was across the Ford.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="佛罗多听见水花四溅的声音。他的脚底下喷溅起许多的水珠。他觉得骏马已经离开了河流，正在快步奔上河岸旁的小径。它正在攀爬着陡坡、正要越过这最后的渡口。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But the pursuers were close behind. At the top of the bank the horse halted and turned about neighing fiercely. There were Nine Riders at the water's edge below, and Frodo's spirit quailed before the threat of their uplifted faces. He knew of nothing that would prevent them from crossing as easily as he had done; and he felt that it was useless to try to escape over the long uncertain path from the Ford to the edge of Rivendell, if once the Riders crossed. In any case he felt that he was commanded urgently to halt. Hatred again stirred in him, but he had no longer the strength to refuse.</div>

<div class="line_en">Fear now filled all Frodo's mind. He thought no longer of his sword. No cry came from him. He shut his eyes and clung to the horse's mane. The wind whistled in his ears, and the bells upon the harness rang wild and shrill.

<div class="line_cn" title="佛罗多觉得十分害怕。他的心思不再放在宝剑上了。他也发不出呼救声。他闭上眼，紧抓着神驹的鬃毛。狂风呼啸吹过他耳边，缰绳上的铃当狂乱的撞击着。一道冰冷的吹息像是利刃一般划过佛罗多的颈子；就在同一瞬间，神驹拔足狂奔，彷佛乘风而飞一般，正好越过最前面的骑士。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At that moment there came a roaring and a rushing: a noise of loud waters rolling many stones. Dimly Frodo saw the river below him rise, and down along its course there came a plumed cavalry of waves.
