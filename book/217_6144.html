As a general thing it makes a body wish HE was dead, too, and done with it all.</div>

<div class="line_en">By jings, I most slumped through the floor! But there warn't no time to swap knives; the old man grabbed me by the hand and shook, and kept on shaking; and all the time how the woman did dance around and laugh and cry; and then how they both did fire off questions about Sid, and Mary, and the rest of the tribe.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="天啊，我差点儿没栽到地板底下去。不过这时已不由人分说，老人一把抓住了我的手握个不停，在这同时，他的老伴呢，正手舞足蹈，又哭又笑。随后他们两人连珠炮似地问到茜特和玛丽以及那家子其余的人来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But if they was joyful, it warn't nothing to what I was; for it was like being born again, I was so glad to find out who I was. Well, they froze to me for two hours; and at last, when my chin was so tired it couldn't hardly go any more, I had told them more about my family – I mean the Sawyer family – than ever happened to any six Sawyer families. And I explained all about how we blowed out a cylinder-head at the mouth of White River, and it took us three days to fix it. Which was all right, and worked first-rate; because THEY didn't know but what it would take three days to fix it. If I'd a called it a bolthead it would a done just as well.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过要说高兴的话，恐怕没有人能比我更高兴的了，因为我几乎象重投了一次娘胎，终于弄清楚了我原来是谁。啊，他们对我问这问那，一连问了两个钟头，最后我的下巴颏也说累了，连话也说不下去了。我讲给他们听有关我家——我是说汤姆·索亚家——的种种情况，比起实际的情况多出六倍还不止。我还讲了，我们的船怎样到了白河口，汽缸盖炸了，又怎样花了三天时间才修好。这样的解释不会有什么问题，而且效果也是头等的，因为为什么要三天才修好，他们一窍不通。要是你说是一只螺丝帽炸飞了，他们也照样会相信。">查看中文翻译</div>
