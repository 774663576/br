<div class="line_en">His errand at Barton, in fact, was a simple one. It was only to ask Elinor to marry him; -- and considering that he was not altogether inexperienced in such a question, it might be strange that he should feel so uncomfortable in the present case as he really did, so much in need of encouragement and fresh air.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="其实，爱德华来巴顿的任务很简单，就是请求埃丽诺嫁给他。鉴于他在这种问题上并非毫无经验，这一次他居然会如此惴惴不安，如此需要别人加以鼓励，需要出去透透新鲜空气，真是不可思议。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Unaccountable, however, as the circumstances of his release might appear to the whole family, it was certain that Edward was free; and to what purpose that freedom would be employed was easily pre-determined by all; -- for after experiencing the blessings of one imprudent engagement, contracted without his mother's consent, as he had already done for more than four years, nothing less could be expected of him in the failure of that, than the immediate contraction of another.</div>

<div class="line_en">How soon he had walked himself into the proper resolution, however, how soon an opportunity of exercising it occurred, in what manner he expressed himself, and how he was received, need not be particularly told. This only need be said; -- that when they all sat down to table at four o'clock, about three hours after his arrival, he had secured his lady, engaged her mother's consent, and was not only in the rapturous profession of the lover, but, in the reality of reason and truth, one of the happiest of men. His situation indeed was more than commonly joyful. He had more than the ordinary triumph of accepted love to swell his heart, and raise his spirits. He was released without any reproach to himself, from an entanglement which had long formed his misery, from a woman whom he had long ceased to love; -- and elevated at once to that security with another, which he must have thought of almost with despair, as soon as he had learnt to consider it with desire. He was brought, not from doubt or suspense, but from misery to happiness; -- and the change was openly spoken in such a genuine, flowing, grateful cheerfulness, as his friends had never witnessed in him before.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，他路上如何迅速地坚定了决心，如何迅速地将决心见诸行动，又以何种方式表达衷曲，这一切都毋庸赘述。需要说明的只是：四点钟光景，大约在他到来三个钟头之后，大家一道坐下吃饭的时候，他已经把他的意中人捞到手了，并且取得了她母亲的同意。他声称自己是世上最幸福的人，这不仅出自情人的狂喜，而且不管从情理和实际来说，他也的确如此。他的情况确实令他异常高兴。除了求爱被接受了之外，他还有别的事情使他心潮格外澎湃，情绪格外高昂。他丝毫不用责备自己，他终于摆脱了一起长期给他造成痛苦的爱情纠葛，摆脱了一个他早已不再爱慕的女人——而且立即一跃赢得了另外—个女人。可是想当初，他刚刚产生这个念头时，心里几乎是绝望的，他不是从疑虑不安。而是从痛苦不堪中转而获得了幸福。他毫不掩饰地表白了这种变化，那股发自内心、感激不尽、涌流不止的欢快劲头，他的朋友们以前从未见过。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It was a foolish, idle inclination on my side," said he, "the consequence of ignorance of the world -- and want of employment. Had my brother given me some active profession when I was removed at eighteen from the care of Mr. Pratt, I think-nay, I am sure, it would never have happened; for though I left Longstaple with what I thought, at the time, a most unconquerable preference for his niece, yet had I then had any pursuit, any object to engage my time and keep me at a distance from her for a few months, I should very soon have outgrown the fancied attachment, especially by mixing more with the world, as in such case I must have done. But instead of having any thing to do, instead of having any profession chosen for me, or being allowed to chuse any myself, I returned home to be completely idle; and for the first twelvemonth afterwards I had not even the nominal employment, which belonging to the university would have given me; for I was not entered at Oxford till I was nineteen. I had therefore nothing in the world to do, but to fancy myself in love; and as my mother did not make my home in every respect comfortable, as I had no friend, no companion in my brother, and disliked new acquaintance, it was not unnatural for me to be very often at Longstaple, where I always felt myself at home, and was always sure of a welcome; and accordingly I spent the greatest part of my time there from eighteen to nineteen: Lucy appeared everything that was amiable and obliging. She was pretty too-at least I thought so then; and I had seen so little of other women, that I could make no comparisons, and see no defects. Considering everything, therefore, I hope, foolish as our engagement was, foolish as it has since in every way been proved, it was not at the time an unnatural or an inexcusable piece of folly."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这是我的愚蠢和惰性引起的，”他说，“是我人情世态全然无知的结果——无所事事的结果。我十八岁脱离普赖特先生关照的时候，我母亲若是给我点事情干干，我想，不，我敢肯定，这种情况决不会发生。因为我离开郎斯特普尔的时候，虽然自以为对他的外甥女喜爱得不得了，但是我假如有点事情干，让我忙上几个月，和她疏远几个月，特别是多跟世人打打交道（在这种情况下，我肯定会这样做的），那我很快就会消除对她异想天开的眷恋。可是我回到家里，却没有事情干——既没给我选好职业，也不让我自己选择，完全无所事事。在随后的第一年，我甚至连个大学生名义上应该忙碌的事情都没有缘份，因为我直到十九岁才进入牛津大学。我在世上无事可做，只能沉溺于爱情的幻想。再加上我母亲没给我安排个舒舒适适的家——我与弟弟不友好，合不来，又讨厌结识新朋友，我也就自然而然地常往郎斯特普尔那里跑，因为我在那里总觉得很自在，总会受到欢迎。就这样，我从十八岁到十九岁，绝大部分时间都消磨在那里。露西似乎非常和蔼，非常可亲，人长得也很漂亮——至少我当时是这么认为的。我很少见到别的女人，没法比较，看不出她有什么缺陷。因此，考虑到这一切，尽管我们的订婚是愚蠢的，而且被彻底证明是愚蠢的，但是我希望，这在当时并非是不近人情、不可宽恕的蠢行。”">查看中文翻译</div>

Mrs. Dashwood, too happy to be comfortable, knew not how to love Edward, nor praise Elinor enough, how to be enough thankful for his release without wounding his delicacy, nor how at once to give them leisure for unrestrained conversation together, and yet enjoy, as she wished, the sight and society of both.</div>

<div class="line_en">But Elinor-how are her feelings to be described? -- From the moment of learning that Lucy was married to another, that Edward was free, to the moment of his justifying the hopes which had so instantly followed, she was every thing by turns but tranquil. But when the second moment had passed, when she found every doubt, every solicitude removed, compared her situation with what so lately it had been, -- saw him honourably released from his former engagement, saw him instantly profiting by the release, to address herself and declare an affection as tender, as constant as she had ever supposed it to be, -- she was oppressed, she was overcome by her own felicity; -- and happily disposed as is the human mind to be easily familiarized with any change for the better, it required several hours to give sedateness to her spirits, or any degree of tranquillity to her heart.</div>

<div class="line_en">Lucy's marriage, the unceasing and reasonable wonder among them all, formed of course one of the earliest discussions of the lovers; -- and Elinor's particular knowledge of each party made it appear to her in every view, as one of the most extraordinary and unaccountable circumstances she had ever heard. How they could be thrown together, and by what attraction Robert could be drawn on to marry a girl, of whose beauty she had herself heard him speak without any admiration, -- a girl too already engaged to his brother, and on whose account that brother had been thrown off by his family-it was beyond her comprehension to make out. To her own heart it was a delightful affair, to her imagination it was even a ridiculous one, but to her reason, her judgment, it was completely a puzzle.</div>

<div class="line_en">Edward could only attempt an explanation by supposing, that, perhaps, at first accidentally meeting, the vanity of the one had been so worked on by the flattery of the other, as to lead by degrees to all the rest. Elinor remembered what Robert had told her in Harley Street, of his opinion of what his own mediation in his brother's affairs might have done, if applied to in time. She repeated it to Edward.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱德华只能试图作作解释，凭借想象说：也许他们先是不期而遇，一方的阿谀奉承激起了另一方的虚荣心，以至逐渐导致了以后的事情。埃丽诺还记得罗伯特在哈利街对她说的话。他谈到他若是及时出面调解的话，他哥哥的事情会出现什么局面。她把那些话向爱德华重复了一遍。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That was exactly like Robert," -- was his immediate observation. --"And that," he presently added, "might perhaps be in his head when the acquaintance between them first began.

<div class="line_cn" title="“罗伯特就是那种人，”爱德华马上说道，“也许，”他当即接下去说，“他们刚开始认识，他脑子里可能就有那个念头。露西起初也许只想求他帮帮我的忙。图谋不轨可能是后来的事情。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">How long it had been carrying on between them, however, he was equally at a loss with herself to make out; for at Oxford, where he had remained for choice ever since his quitting London, he had had no means of hearing of her but from herself, and her letters to the very last were neither less frequent, nor less affectionate than usual. Not the smallest suspicion, therefore, had ever occurred to prepare him for what followed; -- and when at last it burst on him in a letter from Lucy herself, he had been for some time, he believed, half stupified between the wonder, the horror, and the joy of such a deliverance. He put the letter into Elinor's hands.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，他们之间究竟图谋了多久，爱德华像埃丽诺一样，也是不得而知。因为自从离开伦敦之后，他一直情愿呆在牛津，除了收到露西的信，没有别的办法能听到她的消息，而露西的信件直到最后既不比以往见少，也不比以往显得情淡爱弛。因此，他丝毫没有起过疑心，对后来的事情一点没有思想准备。最后，露西来了一封信，给他来了个突然袭击。的的确确，当时一听说自己给解除了这样一门婚事，真是又惊又怕又喜，不禁发了半天呆。他把那封信递到埃丽诺手里：">查看中文翻译</div>

He had quitted Oxford within four and twenty hours after Lucy's letter arrived, and with only one object before him, the nearest road to Barton, had had no leisure to form any scheme of conduct, with which that road did not hold the most intimate connection. He could do nothing till he were assured of his fate with Miss Dashwood; and by his rapidity in seeking that fate, it is to be supposed, in spite of the jealousy with which he had once thought of Colonel Brandon, in spite of the modesty with which he rated his own deserts, and the politeness with which he talked of his doubts, he did not, upon the whole, expect a very cruel reception.

Though his eyes had been long opened, even before his acquaintance with Elinor began, to her ignorance and a want of liberality in some of her opinions -- they had been equally imputed, by him, to her want of education; and till her last letter reached him, he had always believed her to be a well-disposed, good-hearted girl, and thoroughly attached to himself. Nothing but such a persuasion could have prevented his putting an end to an engagement, which, long before the discovery of it laid him open to his mother's anger, had been a continual source of disquiet and regret to him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="露西早先让托马斯给她们捎来个口信，这当然是个骗局，旨在恶意中伤爱德华，对此，埃丽诺看得一清二楚。至于爱德华自己，他现在彻底看透了露西的本性，他毫不迟疑地相信，她性情邪恶乖戾，再卑鄙的事情都干得出来。虽然他甚至早在认识埃丽诺之前，就从她的一些见解中看出了她的无知和狭隘，但他把这些缺陷都归咎于缺乏教育的结果。直至收到她最后一封信之前，他一直认为她是个和蔼善良的姑娘，对她一片深情。只是因为抱有这种信念，他才没有结束这起婚约，虽然早在他母亲发现后对他大发雷霆之前，这门亲事就一直是他烦恼和悔恨的根源。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I thought it my duty," said he, "independent of my feelings, to give her the option of continuing the engagement or not, when I was renounced by my mother, and stood to all appearance without a friend in the world to assist me. In such a situation as that, where there seemed nothing to tempt the avarice or the vanity of any living creature, how could I suppose, when she so earnestly, so warmly insisted on sharing my fate, whatever it might be, that any thing but the most disinterested affection was her inducement? And even now, I cannot comprehend on what motive she acted, or what fancied advantage it could be to her, to be fettered to a man for whom she had not the smallest regard, and who had only two thousand pounds in the world. She could not foresee that Colonel Brandon would give me a living."</div>

Among such friends, however, and such flattery, he did revive. No rumour of Lucy's marriage had yet reached him: -- he knew nothing of what had passed; and the first hours of his visit were consequently spent in hearing and in wondering. Every thing was explained to him by Mrs. Dashwood, and he found fresh reason to rejoice in what he had done for Mr. Ferrars, since eventually it promoted the interest of Elinor.</div>

Mrs. Jennings wrote to tell the wonderful tale, to vent her honest indignation against the jilting girl, and pour forth her compassion towards poor Mr. Edward, who, she was sure, had quite doted upon the worthless hussy, and was now, by all accounts, almost broken-hearted, at Oxford. -- "I do think," she continued, "nothing was ever carried on so sly; for it was but two days before Lucy called and sat a couple of hours with me. Not a soul suspected anything of the matter, not even Nancy, who, poor soul! came crying to me the day after, in a great fright for fear of Mrs. Ferrars, as well as not knowing how to get to Plymouth; for Lucy it seems borrowed all her money before she went off to be married, on purpose we suppose to make a show with, and poor Nancy had not seven shillings in the world; -- so I was very glad to give her five guineas to take her down to Exeter, where she thinks of staying three or four weeks with Mrs. Burgess, in hopes, as I tell her, to fall in with the Doctor again.

<div class="line_en">Mr. Dashwood's strains were more solemn. Mrs. Ferrars was the most unfortunate of women-poor Fanny had suffered agonies of sensibility-and he considered the existence of each, under such a blow, with grateful wonder. Robert's offence was unpardonable, but Lucy's was infinitely worse. Neither of them were ever again to be mentioned to Mrs. Ferrars; and even, if she might hereafter be induced to forgive her son, his wife should never be acknowledged as her daughter, nor be permitted to appear in her presence. The secrecy with which everything had been carried on between them, was rationally treated as enormously heightening the crime, because, had any suspicion of it occurred to the others, proper measures would have been taken to prevent the marriage; and he called on Elinor to join with him in regretting that Lucy's engagement with Edward had not rather been fulfilled, than that she should thus be the means of spreading misery farther in the family. -- He thus continued:</div>
