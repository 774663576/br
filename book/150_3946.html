<div class="line_en">"Shall we sit down a little? We haven't sat here for ages." The plain was spread before her widely; it was tranquil and serene in the morning light. "It's only a few weeks that I've been here and it seems a lifetime."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们坐下来待一会儿吗？我们很久很久没有来过这儿了。”广阔的平原在她的眼前铺展开去，在晨光中显得静谧而安宁。“仅仅是几个礼拜以前我才到过这儿，却好像是上一辈子的事儿了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They sauntered along the causeway till they came to the top of the hill on which stood that archway, the memorial to a virtuous widow, which had occupied so large a part of Kitty's impression of the place. It was a symbol, but of what she scarcely knew; she could not tell why it bore a note of so sardonic irony.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们沿着堤道漫步到了山顶，那里矗立着那座为某位贞洁的寡妇建造的拱门。在凯蒂对这块地方的印象中，这座拱门占去了很大的一部分。它是一个象征，但是到底象征了什么，她却琢磨不出来。她也不知道在她看来它为何具有讽刺意味。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He did no answer and for a while she allowed her thoughts to wander. She gave a sigh.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他没有回答，而她任由自己的思绪胡乱地游荡，然后她叹了口气。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Just now, when they washed Walter, before they put him into the coffin I looked at him. He looked very young. Too young to die. Do you remember that beggar that we saw the first time you took me for a walk? I was frightened not because he was dead, but because he looked as though he'd never been a human being. He was just a dead animal. And now again, with Walter, it looked so like a machine that has ran down. That's what is so frightening. And if it is only a machine how futile is all this suffering and the heart pains and the misery."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“刚才，他们在入殓之前给瓦尔特做洗礼，我看了他。他看着很年轻。他太年轻就死了。你记得你第一次带我出来散步时看见的那个乞丐吗？我不是因为见到了死人而感到害怕，而是因为我看他时，觉得他一点也不像人，仅仅是一具动物的尸体。而现在，我看瓦尔特时，他就像一部停下来的机器。那才是可怕之处。如果他只是一部机器，那么所有这些病痛、心碎、苦难，又都算得了什么呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He did not answer, but his eyes travelled over the landscape at their feet. The wide expanse on that gay and sunny morning fdled the heart with exultation. The trim little rice-fields stretched as far as the eye could see and in many of them the blue-clad peasants with their buffaloes were working industriously. It was a peaceful and a happy scene. Kitty broke the silence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他没有回答，眼睛四下眺望着脚下的风景。辽阔的原野在欢快、明媚的晨光中蔓延，一眼望去使人心旷神怡。一块块整整齐齐的稻田铺展在原野上，望也望不到边。稻田里错落着一个个身着布衣的农民的身影，他们正手握镰刀辛勤地劳作着，真是一派祥和而温馨的场景。凯蒂打破了沉默。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I can't tell you how deeply moved I've been by all I've seen at the convent. They're wonderful, those nuns, they make me feel utterly worthless. They give up everything, their home, their country, love, children, freedom; and all the little things which I sometimes think must be harder still to give up, flowers and green fields, going for a walk on an autumn day, books and music, comfort, everything they give up, everything. And they do it so that they may devote themselves to a life of sacrifice and poverty, obedience, killing work and prayer. To all of them this world is really and truly a place of exile. Life is a cross which they willingly bear, but in their hearts all the time is the desire -- oh, it's so much stronger than desire, it's a longing, an eager, passionate longing for the death which shall lead them to life everlasting."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我说不出在修道院里的所见所闻多么地打动了我。她们太出色了，那些嬷嬷，相形之下我一文不值。她们放弃了一切，她们的家，她们的祖国，她们的爱，孩子，自由，还有许多点点滴滴的、在我现在看来都难以割舍的事儿，鲜花，碧绿的田野，秋日里的漫步，书籍和音乐，还有舒适。所有的东西她们都放弃了，所有的。而她们为之投入的又是什么呢？牺牲，贫穷，听从吩咐，繁重的活计，祈祷。对她们所有人来说，这个世界是一个名副其实的流放地。生活是一个她们情愿背负的十字架，在她们的心里始终希望——不，比希望要强烈得多，是向往、期待、渴求最终的死亡将她们引向永恒。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I wonder. I wonder if it matters that what they have aimed at is illusion. Their lives are in themselves beautiful. I have an idea that the only thing which makes it possible to regard this world we live in without disgust is the beauty which now and then men create out of the chaos. The pictures they paint, the music they compose, the books they write, and the lives they lead. Of all these the richest in beauty is the beautiful life. That is the perfect work of art."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我持以怀疑。我怀疑她们的理想是否镜花水月，并非如此重要。她们的生活本身就已经成为美丽的东西。我有一种想法，觉得唯一能使我们从对这个世界的嫌恶中解脱出来的，就是纵使世事纷乱，人们依然不断创造出来的美的事物。人们描摹的绘画，谱写的乐曲，编撰的书籍，和人们的生活。而其中最为丰饶的美，就是人们美丽的生活。那是完美的艺术杰作。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，”她微笑着说，“我对音乐一窍不通，但是很喜欢听。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Each member of the orchestra plays his own little instrument, and what do you think he knows of the complicated harmonies which unroll themselves on the indifferent air? He is concerned only with his own small share. But he knows that the symphony is lovely, and though there's none to hear it, it is lovely still, and he is content to play his part."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“管弦乐团里的每一个成员负责一件乐器，你觉得在一支乐曲逐渐展开的同时，乐器的演奏者们会时刻关注乐队的整体效果吗？他们只关心自己演奏的那部分，但是他们深知整支乐曲是优美的，即便没人去注意听它，它依然是优美的。所以他们可以安心地演奏自己的那一部分。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It is the Way and the Waygoer. It is the eternal road along which walk all beings, but no being made it, for itself is being. It is everything and nothing. From it all things spring, all things conform to it, and to it at last all things return. It is a square without angles, a sound which ears cannot hear, and an image without form. It is a vast net and though its meshes are as wide as the sea it lets nothing through. It is the sanctuary where all things find refuge. It is nowhere, but without looking out of the window you may see it. Desire not to desire, it teaches, and leave all things to take their course. He that humbles himself shall be preserved entire. He that bends shall be made straight. Failure is the foundation of success and success is the lurking-place of failure; but who can tell when the turning point will come? He who strives after tenderness can become even as a little child. Gentleness brings victory to him who attacks and safety to him who defends. Mighty is he who conquers himself."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“道也就是路，和行路的人。道是一条世间万物都行走于上的永恒的路。但它不是被万物创造出来的，因为道本身也是万物之一。道中充盈着万物，同时又虚无一物。万物由道而生，循着道成长，而后又回归于道。可以说它是方形但却没有棱角，是声音却不为耳朵所能听见，是张画像却看不见线条和色彩。道是一张巨大的网，网眼大如海洋，却恢恢不漏。它是万物寄居的避难之所。它不在任何地方，可是你探身出窗就能发现它的踪迹。不管它愿意与否，它赐予了万物行事的法则，然后任由它们自长自成。依照着道，卑下会变成英武，驼背也可以变为挺拔。失败可能带来成功，而成功则隐藏着失败。但是谁能辨别两者何时交替？追求个性的人可能会平顺如孩童。中庸练达会使势强的人旗开得胜，使势弱的人回避安身。征服自己的人是最强的人。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Waddington gave her a little look, hesitated an instant, and then with a faint smile on his comic face answered:</div>

<div class="line_en">"Forgive me for talking about this again," he said gently, "but I thought it might comfort you -- I know how frightfully difficult it is on these occasions to say anything that is of the least use -- I thought it might mean something to you that Walter died a martyr to science and to his duty."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“请原谅我又谈起了这个。”他轻柔地说道，“但是我以为这可以使你感到一些安慰——我知道在这种场合任何劝说都是无济于事的——或许这意味着瓦尔特是为科学牺牲的，是一个以身殉职的烈士。”">查看中文翻译</div>
