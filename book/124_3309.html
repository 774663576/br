<div class="line_en">I went over to his house about noon, after he had eaten and puked up breakfast. He met me at the door in his wheelchair, no longer the muscular, gorgeous boy who stared at me at Support Group, but still half smiling, still smoking his unlit cigarette, his blue eyes bright and alive.</div>

<div class="line_en">We ate lunch with his parents at the dining room table. Peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches and last night's asparagus. Gus didn't eat. I asked how he was feeling.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们和他父母一起在餐厅吃午饭。花生酱果冻三明治和昨晚剩的芦笋。格斯没吃。我问他感觉怎么样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Good. What'd you do last night?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不坏。你昨晚做什么了？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, I stand by my pre-Van Houten analysis of the Dutch Tulip Man. Not a con man, but not as rich as he was letting on."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好吧，我仍然坚持前范·豪滕时代我对于荷兰郁金香老爹的分析。不是个骗子，但也没有他故意让人以为的那么有钱。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Grand," he said. "And you?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好极了，”他说，“你呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I slept quite a lot. I want to write you a sequel, Hazel Grace, but I'm just so damned tired all the time."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我睡了好久。我想给你写个续集的，海蓁·格蕾丝，但我就是一直都他妈那么累。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You can just tell it to me," I said.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Haven't settled on an opinion there. Patience, Grasshopper." Augustus smiled. His parents were quiet, watching him, never looking away, like they just wanted to enjoy The Gus Waters Show while it was still in town. "Sometimes I dream that I'm writing a memoir. A memoir would be just the thing to keep me in the hearts and memories of my adoring public."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“关于她还没有最后决定呢。耐心点，蚂蚱小姐。”奥古斯塔斯微微一笑。他父母一直安静地看着他，分毫也不愿挪开视线，好像他们想趁“格斯·沃特斯演出季”还没结束之前尽情欣赏。“有时候我梦见我在写回忆录。回忆录正是我所需要的，能让我留在热爱我的公众的心里，永志不忘。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After lunch, we went outside to the backyard. He was still well enough to push his own wheelchair, pulling miniature wheelies to get the front wheels over the bump in the doorway. Still athletic, in spite of it all, blessed with balance and quick reflexes that even the abundant narcotics could not fully mask.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吃完午饭，我们出门到后院去。他的身体还可以，足以自己开动轮椅，过门槛的时候还使了个小小的前轮离地平衡特技。就算到了这时候，他的运动员素质还在，协调性和敏捷的反应能力还在，大量的麻醉药物也无法完全掩盖。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Why do you need an adoring public when you've got me?" I asked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你都有我了，干吗还需要热爱你的公众？”我问。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yeah. My nostalgia is so extreme that I am capable of missing a swing my butt never actually touched."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是啊。我的怀旧感简直登峰造极，竟开始怀念一架我的屁股从来没有真正碰过的秋千了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We sat out there in silence for a minute and then Gus said, "I wish we had that swing set sometimes."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“怀旧是癌症的副作用。”我对他说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Nah, nostalgia is a side effect of dying," he answered. Above us, the wind blew and the branching shadows rearranged themselves on our skin. Gus squeezed my hand. "It is a good life, Hazel Grace."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，怀旧是死亡的副作用。”他回答。我们头顶上有风吹过，树枝的阴影在我们的皮肤上晃动，纠结缠绕。格斯用力握了握我的手。“这一生很不错，海蓁·格蕾丝。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We went inside when he needed meds, which were pressed into him along with liquid nutrition through his G-tube, a bit of plastic that disappeared into his belly. He was quiet for a while, zoned out. His mom wanted him to take a nap, but he kept shaking his head no when she suggested it, so we just let him sit there half asleep in the chair for a while.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他需要用药时，我们进了屋，药物是和营养液一道通过胃管输送的，那是一条塑料管，末端消失在他的腹部。他安静了一会儿，失去了意识。他妈妈本想让他小睡一会儿，但她一说，他就拼命摇头不愿意，于是我们就让他坐在椅子上，半睡半醒地待了一阵子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His parents watched an old video of Gus with his sisters -- they were probably my age and Gus was about five. They were playing basketball in the driveway of a different house, and even though Gus was tiny, he could dribble like he'd been born doing it, running circles around his sisters as they laughed. It was the first time I'd even seen him play basketball. "He was good," I said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的父母看了一段很久以前的录像，是格斯和他两个姐姐——录像里她们大概跟我现在一样大，格斯大概五岁。他们在车道上玩篮球，不是现在这栋房子。尽管格斯才一点点小，运球的动作却像个天生的篮球运动员。他围着两个姐姐转圈跑，把她们逗得大笑。这是我第一次看他打篮球。“他打得真好。”我说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Should've seen him in high school," his dad said. "Started varsity as a freshman."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你真该看看他高中时候，”他爸爸说，“高一就进学校代表队了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His mom and dad wheeled the chair downstairs with Gus still in it, bouncing down crazily in a way that would have been dangerous if danger retained its relevance, and then they left us alone. He got into bed and we lay there together under the covers, me on my side and Gus on his back, my head on his bony shoulder, his heat radiating through his polo shirt and into my skin, my feet tangled with his real foot, my hand on his cheek.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他妈妈和爸爸推着他坐的轮椅下楼去，一路颠簸得厉害，简直有可能发生危险——如果此刻谈危险还有意义的话。然后，他们留下我俩独处。格斯上了床，我们一起躺在被子里，我侧躺着，他仰面朝天，我的头靠着他瘦骨支离的肩膀，他身体的热度透过POLO衫辐射进我的皮肤里，我的双脚和他的单脚缠在一起，一只手放在他脸颊上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We woke up later and arranged an armada of pillows so that we could sit comfortably against the edge of the bed and played Counterinsurgence 2: The Price of Dawn. I sucked at it, of course, but my sucking was useful to him: It made it easier for him to die beautifully, to jump in front of a sniper's bullet and sacrifice himself for me, or else to kill a sentry who was just about to shoot me. How he reveled in saving me. He shouted, "You will not kill my girlfriend today, International Terrorist of Ambiguous Nationality!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="后来我们睡醒了，垒起一列长枕头，舒舒服服地坐在床边上玩《以暴制暴2：黎明的代价》。当然，我玩得很烂，但这样对格斯倒很有用。他更容易死得漂漂亮亮，要么跳起来挡住一颗狙击手的子弹，为了我牺牲自己，或者干掉一个正要对我开枪的岗哨。他是多么陶醉于救我的命啊。他嚷道：“你今天别想要我女朋友的命，国籍不明的国际恐怖分子！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When I got his face nose-touchingly close so that I could only see his eyes, I couldn't tell he was sick. We kissed for a while and then lay together listening to The Hectic Glow's eponymous album, and eventually we fell asleep like that, a quantum entanglement of tubes and bodies.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当我离他的脸近到鼻子都快碰上时，我的眼里只能看到他的眼睛，这时我看不出来他是个病人。我们亲吻了一会儿，然后一起躺着听“潮热”乐队的同名专辑，最终我们就那样睡着了：一堆管子和身体组成的量子纠缠。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It crossed my mind to fake a choking incident or something so that he might give me the Heimlich. Maybe then he could rid himself of this fear that his life had been lived and lost for no greater good. But then I imagined him being physically unable to Heimlich, and me having to reveal that it was all a ruse, and the ensuing mutual humiliation.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我突然灵机一动，想假装出个状况，窒息或者什么的，给他一个用海姆立克急救法对我施救的机会。也许这样他就能摆脱那种恐惧——觉得他不管活着还是死去都没有为大众福祉做出过贡献。可是随后我想象了一下，他的体力可能不足以实施海姆立克急救法，于是我不得不露馅，表明其实这是一场骗局，最后我们只能双双落得一番羞辱。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Finally, his dad came down and dragged Gus back upstairs, and in the entryway, beneath an Encouragement telling me that Friends Are Forever, I knelt to kiss him good night. I went home and ate dinner with my parents, leaving Gus to eat (and puke up) his own dinner.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后，格斯爸爸下楼来把他拖回楼上，在进门的通道处，一块谆谆教导我“友情亘古长存”的“精神鼓舞”下面，我跪下来跟他吻别，互道晚安。我回家和爸妈一起吃晚饭，留下格斯自己在家吃（然后吐）晚饭。">查看中文翻译</div>
