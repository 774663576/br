<div class="line_en">He leaned out of the window and kissed her. The train started, and she stood on the wooden platform of the little station, waving her handkerchief till it was out of sight. Her heart was dreadfully heavy, and the few hundred yards to the vicarage seemed very, very long. It was natural enough that he should be eager to go, she thought, he was a boy and the future beckoned to him; but she -- she clenched her teeth so that she should not cry. She uttered a little inward prayer that God would guard him, and keep him out of temptation, and give him happiness and good fortune.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="菲利普将身子探出车窗，吻了吻她。火车启动了。她站在小车站的木制月台上，频频挥动手绢，直至火车消失在视野之外。她心头像压上了铅块，沉重得很。回牧师公馆的路程总共才几百码，却似有千里之遥。她边走边沉思：菲利普这孩子，也难怪他那么迫不及待地要走，他毕竟年轻，未来在向他召唤。可她自己——她紧咬牙关，强忍着不哭出来。她默默祈祷，求上帝暗中保佑菲利普，让他免受诱惑，赐予他幸福和好运。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But Philip ceased to think of her a moment after he had settled down in his carriage. He thought only of the future. He had written to Mrs. Otter, the massiere to whom Hayward had given him an introduction, and had in his pocket an invitation to tea on the following day. When he arrived in Paris he had his luggage put on a cab and trundled off slowly through the gay streets, over the bridge, and along the narrow ways of the Latin Quarter. He had taken a room at the Hotel des Deux Ecoles, which was in a shabby street off the Boulevard du Montparnasse; it was convenient for Amitrano's School at which he was going to work. A waiter took his box up five flights of stairs, and Philip was shown into a tiny room, fusty from unopened windows, the greater part of which was taken up by a large wooden bed with a canopy over it of red rep; there were heavy curtains on the windows of the same dingy material; the chest of drawers served also as a washing-stand; and there was a massive wardrobe of the style which is connected with the good King Louis Philippe. The wall-paper was discoloured with age; it was dark gray, and there could be vaguely seen on it garlands of brown leaves. To Philip the room seemed quaint and charming.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是菲利普在车厢里坐定身子，不多一会就把他伯母撇在脑后。他心里充满着对未来的憧憬。他写过一封信给奥特太太某美术学校的司库，海沃德曾向她介绍过菲利普的情况，这时菲利普口袋里还揣着奥特太太邀他明天去喝茶的请帖。到了巴黎，他雇了辆小马车，让人把行李放到车上。马车徐徐行进，穿过五光十色的街道，爬过大桥，驶入拉丁区的狭街陋巷。菲利普“两”旅社已租下一个房问。这家旅馆坐落在离蒙帕纳斯大街不远的一条穷陋小街上，从这里到他学画的阿米特拉诺美术学校还算方便。一位侍者把行李搬上五楼，菲利普被领进一间小房间，里面窗户关得严严的，一进门就闻到股霉味。房间大部分地盘都叫一张大木床给占了。床上蒙着大红棱纹平布帐幔，窗上挂着同样布料制成的、厚实但已失去光泽的窗帘。五斗橱兼用作脸盆架，另外还有一只结实的大衣柜，其式样令人联想起那位贤明君主路易·腓力普。房间里的糊墙纸因年深日久，原来的颜色已褪尽，现呈深灰色，不过从纸上还能依稀辨认出村有棕色树叶的花环图案。菲利普觉得这房间布置得富有奇趣，令人销魂。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Though it was late he felt too excited to sleep and, going out, made his way into the boulevard and walked towards the light. This led him to the station; and the square in front of it, vivid with arc-lamps, noisy with the yellow trams that seemed to cross it in all directions, made him laugh aloud with joy. There were cafes all round, and by chance, thirsty and eager to get a nearer sight of the crowd, Philip installed himself at a little table outside the Cafe de Versailles. Every other table was taken, for it was a fine night; and Philip looked curiously at the people, here little family groups, there a knot of men with odd-shaped hats and beards talking loudly and gesticulating; next to him were two men who looked like painters with women who Philip hoped were not their lawful wives; behind him he heard Americans loudly arguing on art. His soul was thrilled. He sat till very late, tired out but too happy to move, and when at last he went to bed he was wide awake; he listened to the manifold noise of Paris.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="夜已深沉，菲利普却兴奋得难以成眠。他索性出了旅馆，走上大街，朝华灯辉门处信步逛去。他不知不觉来到火车站。车站前面的广场，在几盏弧光灯的照耀下，显得生趣盎然，黄颜色的有轨电车，似乎是从四面八方涌至广场，又丁丁当当地横穿而过。菲利普注视着这一切，禁不住快活地笑出声来。广场四周开设了不少咖啡馆。他正巧有点口渴，加上也很想把街上的人群看个仔细，于是就在凡尔赛啡咖馆外面的露天小餐桌旁坐下。今晚夜色迷人，其他餐桌上都已坐满了人，菲利普用好奇的目光打量着周围的人群：这边是家人在团聚小饮，那边坐着一伙头上戴着奇形怪状的帽子、下巴上蓄着大胡子的男子，他们一边粗声大气地拉呱，一边不住地指手划脚；邻坐的两个男子看上去像是画家，身边还坐着妇人，菲利普心想，她们不是画家的结发之妻才妙呢；背后，他听到有几个美国人在高谈阔论，争辩着有关艺术的问题。菲利普心弦震颤。他就这么坐在那儿，一直到很晚才恋恋不舍地离去，尽管筋疲力尽，心里却美滋滋的。等他最后好不容易上了床，却心清神爽，倦意全无。他侧耳谛听着巴黎夜生活的鼎沸喧嚣。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Next day about tea-time he made his way to the Lion de Belfort, and in a new street that led out of the Boulevard Raspail found Mrs. Otter. She was an insignificant woman of thirty, with a provincial air and a deliberately lady-like manner; she introduced him to her mother. He discovered presently that she had been studying in Paris for three years and later that she was separated from her husband. She had in her small drawing-room one or two portraits which she had painted, and to Philip's inexperience they seemed extremely accomplished.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天下午喝茶时分，菲利普动身去贝尔福狮子街，在一条由拉斯帕依大街向外延伸的新铺筑的马路上，找到了奥特太太的寓所，奥特太太是个三十岁光景的微不足道的妇人，仪态粗俗，却硬摆出一副贵夫人的派头。她把菲利普介绍给她母亲。没聊上几句，菲利普就了解到她已在巴黎学了三年美术，后来又知道她已同丈夫分道扬镳。小小的起居室里，挂着一两幅出自她手笔的肖像画。菲利普毕竟不是个行家，在他看来，这些画尽善至美，功力已到了炉火纯青的地步。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When he left Mrs. Otter Philip went to buy drawing materials; and next morning at the stroke of nine, trying to seem self-assured, he presented himself at the school. Mrs. Otter was already there, and she came forward with a friendly smile. He had been anxious about the reception he would have as a nouveau, for he had read a good deal of the rough joking to which a newcomer was exposed at some of the studios; but Mrs. Otter had reassured him.</div>

<div class="line_en">When Philip entered, the people in the studio had looked at him curiously, and the model gave him an indifferent glance, but now they ceased to pay attention to him. Philip, with his beautiful sheet of paper in front of him, stared awkwardly at the model. He did not know how to begin. He had never seen a naked woman before. She was not young and her breasts were shrivelled. She had colourless, fair hair that fell over her forehead untidily, and her face was covered with large freckles. He glanced at Miss Price's work. She had only been working on it two days, and it looked as though she had had trouble; her paper was in a mess from constant rubbing out, and to Philip's eyes the figure looked strangely distorted.</div>

He got into difficulties. He glanced at Miss Price. She was working with vehement gravity. Her brow was wrinkled with eagerness, and there was an anxious look in her eyes. It was hot in the studio, and drops of sweat stood on her forehead. She was a girl of twenty-six, with a great deal of dull gold hair; it was handsome hair, but it was carelessly done, dragged back from her forehead and tied in a hurried knot. She had a large face, with broad, flat features and small eyes; her skin was pasty, with a singular unhealthiness of tone, and there was no colour in the cheeks. She had an unwashed air and you could not help wondering if she slept in her clothes. She was serious and silent. When the next pause came, she stepped back to look at her work.</div>

He was long and desperately thin; his huge bones seemed to protrude from his body; his elbows were so sharp that they appeared to jut out through the arms of his shabby coat. His trousers were frayed at the bottom, and on each of his boots was a clumsy patch. Miss Price got up and went over to Philip's easel.</div>
