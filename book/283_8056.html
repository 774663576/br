<div class="line_en">Enscombe however was gracious, gracious in fact, if not in word. His wish of staying longer evidently did not please; but it was not opposed. All was safe and prosperous; and as the removal of one solicitude generally makes way for another, Emma, being now certain of her ball, began to adopt as the next vexation Mr. Knightley's provoking indifference about it. Either because he did not dance himself, or because the plan had been formed without his being consulted, he seemed resolved that it should not interest him, determined against its exciting any present curiosity, or affording him any future amusement. To her voluntary communications Emma could get no more approving reply, than,</div>

<div class="line_en">One thing only was wanting to make the prospect of the ball completely satisfactory to Emma-its being fixed for a day within the granted term of Frank Churchill's stay in Surry; for, in spite of Mr. Weston's confidence, she could not think it so very impossible that the Churchills might not allow their nephew to remain a day beyond his fortnight. But this was not judged feasible. The preparations must take their time, nothing could be properly ready till the third week were entered on, and for a few days they must be planning, proceeding and hoping in uncertainty-at the risk -- in her opinion, the great risk, of its being all in vain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="只差一件事就可以使爱玛对行将举行的舞会感到百分之百满意——日期要定在弗兰克·邱吉尔获准待在萨里的期限内。尽避韦斯顿先生满怀信心，爱玛还是认为，邱吉尔夫妇说不定只许外甥住满两周，想多住一天都不行。可是，在两周内举行舞会看来是行不通的。准备工作还需要时间，要等到进入第三周才能准备妥当，而且得花几天工夫进行筹划，一边盘算，一边着手进行，心里没有多少握——而要冒着危险——在她看来，还要冒着很大的危险，说不定到头来徒劳一场。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Very well. If the Westons think it worth while to be at all this trouble for a few hours of noisy entertainment, I have nothing to say against it, but that they shall not chuse pleasures for me. -- Oh! yes, I must be there; I could not refuse; and I will keep as much awake as I can; but I would rather be at home, looking over William Larkins's week's account; much rather, I confess. -- Pleasure in seeing dancing! -- not I, indeed-I never look at it -- I do not know who does. -- Fine dancing, I believe, like virtue, must be its own reward. Those who are standing by are usually thinking of something very different."</div>

<div class="line_en">Alas! there was soon no leisure for quarrelling with Mr. Knightley. Two days of joyful security were immediately followed by the over-throw of every thing. A letter arrived from Mr. Churchill to urge his nephew's instant return. Mrs. Churchill was unwell -- far too unwell to do without him; she had been in a very suffering state (so said her husband) when writing to her nephew two days before, though from her usual unwillingness to give pain, and constant habit of never thinking of herself, she had not mentioned it; but now she was too ill to trifle, and must entreat him to set off for Enscombe without delay.</div>

It had been a very happy fortnight, and forlorn must be the sinking from it into the common course of Hartfield days. To complete every other recommendation, he had almost told her that he loved her. What strength, or what constancy of affection he might be subject to, was another point; but at present she could not doubt his having a decidedly warm admiration, a conscious preference of herself; and this persuasion, joined to all the rest, made her think that she must be a little in love with him, in spite of every previous determination against it.</div>
