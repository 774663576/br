<div class="line_en">I climbed back on board, and while I was getting dressed on deck, I examined the Dulcibella. She seemed very small but was, in fact, ten metres long and three metres wide. She looked large enough for sailing weekends close to the shore, but I could not imagine how she had made the journey from England to the Baltic. She was not a beautiful boat, either, sitting low in the water, and with a very tall mast. But in spite of her plainness, she looked very solid and safe, and I was grateful for that.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Quite well," I replied crossly, and stepped out of bed into a pool of water. But I went up on deck and, diving over the side, buried my stiffness and bad temper in the loveliest fiord of the lovely Baltic.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“还不错。”我闷闷不乐地回答，一下床就踩到一滩水。但我还是走上甲板，跃过船舷跳入美丽的波罗的海，在这片最美的峡湾里舒展僵硬的四肢，洗掉坏情绪。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After a restless night in my uncomfortable bed, I was woken next morning by water pouring down on top of me. I sat up suddenly and hit my head on the ceiling.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="由于床不舒服，我一夜没睡好，第二天一早被水劈头盖脸地浇醒。我猛地坐起身来，头撞到了天花板。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Sorry!" cried Davies cheerfully from above. "I'm washing the deck. Come up and swim. Slept well?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“对不起！”头顶传来戴维斯欢快的喊声，“我在冲洗甲板。上来游泳吧！睡得好吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Davies cooked a surprisingly good breakfast, better than my London cook ever managed. As soon as we had washed the dishes, he said, "There's a good wind. Let's sail down the fiord," and disappeared up on deck. I joined him there, trying to be of use, but he did not need me, or even notice me. He seemed to be everywhere at once, raising the sail, pulling on ropes, and steering the yacht, all at the same time. Soon the Dulcibella was turning away from the shore and sailing towards the open fiord.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="戴维斯做的早餐出乎意料地好吃，我在伦敦的厨子从没达到这水平。我们刚洗完碗碟，他便说：“今天风不错。咱们开着船往峡湾下游走走吧。”说完就爬到甲板上去了。我也跟了上去，想帮帮忙，可他不需要我，甚至都注意不到我的存在。他就像会分身术似的，升起风帆，拉紧绳索，掌握方向。很快，“达尔茜贝拉”号就掉头离开岸边，朝峡湾外驶去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I sat on deck, lazily watching the green fields and little white houses pass slowly by. With the clear blue sky, and the sun shining on the water, it was a beautiful view. I looked round at Davies. He had one brown arm on the helm, and seemed lost in his thoughts. For a moment I studied his face more closely than I had ever done before. I had never considered him worth spending much of my valuable time on, as I had always thought him very ordinary. Now I was beginning to see how wrong I had been. In that calm face I saw honesty, and bravery. Above all, he was sincere. I began to wonder how often I had misjudged other people in the past; I had always been so confident of choosing the right men to know.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我懒洋洋地坐在甲板上，绿色的田野和白色的小房子缓缓从眼前掠过，加上晴朗的蓝天和水面的点点阳光，真是一幅优美的画面。我又回头看看戴维斯，他一只黝黑的胳膊搭在舵轮上，似乎沉浸在自己的思绪中。我观察了一会儿他的脸，比之前任何时候看得都仔细。以前我一直觉得他是个很平凡的人，不值得在他身上花费我宝贵的时间。现在，我才意识到自己之前的看法有多么荒谬。在他平静的脸上，我看到了正直和勇气。最重要的是，他很真诚。我开始扪心自问，之前我有多少次错看了别人，还洋洋自得地认为自己很会交朋友。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Suddenly Davies threw me the chart. "Just tell me which side of the buoy we should pass, will you?" he said. I looked in horror at the black marks on the paper, which meant nothing to me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="戴维斯突然把海图抛给我：“能告诉我咱们该走浮标的哪一边吗？”我惊恐地看着图上的黑色标记，什么都看不懂。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In a minute we were passing the buoy, probably on the wrong side, since sand could clearly be seen below us. Then there was a loud unpleasant noise under the boat, and the Dulcibella ran aground.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Crew!" said Davies, shocked. "Why, the whole fun of the thing is to do everything yourself."</div>

<div class="line_en">"I'm awfully sorry! But it's just the opposite -- you may be all the use in the world when…" He did not finish, and became lost in his thoughts again.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“唉，整个早上我都觉得自己完全帮不上忙。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That night we anchored in calm water in the shelter of the shore, and after supper I asked Davies to tell me about his voyage from England. He spread his charts on the table, and took his logbook from the shelf.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当晚，我们停泊在风平浪静的岸边。晚饭后，我让戴维斯讲讲他是怎样从英格兰一路航行过来的。他在桌上铺开海图，又从架子上取下航海日志。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"There's not really much to tell," he began. "My friend Morrison and I left Dover on 6th August, and sailed to Ostend, and up the Dutch coast. Then we travelled through Holland by river and canal to Rotterdam, on to Amsterdam, and back into the North Sea. We sailed round the Zuyder Zee, then north to the Frisian Islands. Look, they stretch for a hundred and ninety kilometres from west to east, along the Dutch and German coast."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“其实也没有太多可讲的。”他打开了话匣子，“8月6号我和朋友莫里森从多佛尔起航，驶到奥斯坦德，再沿着荷兰的海岸向北航行。接着，我们驶入荷兰内陆，沿河流和运河到达鹿特丹，再到阿姆斯特丹，然后折返北海。之后我们经过须得海，向北到达弗里西亚群岛。看，这片群岛沿着荷兰和德国的海岸线展开，东西有190公里长。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“在那儿航行不会很危险吗？”我问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He suddenly became enthusiastic. "Look at this," he said, pointing to an area covered with little black marks on the chart. "It's all sand between the islands and the coast. There are channels through the sands but they're all wrong on the charts because the sands keep moving all the time. It's a wonderful place for sailing -- no towns or harbours, just a few villages with a shop where you can get food. The islands themselves are really just big sandbanks, you see."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他突然来了兴致。“看这个，”他指着海图上一块画满小黑点的地方说，“这儿的岛屿和海岸之间全是沙洲。沙洲之间有航道，但海图上标的都不对，因为沙洲一直在不停移动。这是个航行的好地方——没有城市，没有海港，只有一些小村庄，你可以在村里的商店买到食物。其实，这些岛屿本身也不过是大一点的沙洲罢了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Didn't you ever take a pilot?" I asked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你从没请过引航员吗？”我问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Not if you know what you're doing," he replied. "The Dulcibella can sail in very shallow water. Of course, you can't help running aground sometimes. At high tide those sandbanks are all hidden -- everything looks the same."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“只要保持警惕就没事儿。”他回答，“‘达尔茜贝拉’号能在非常浅的水域行驶。当然，有时也难免会搁浅。涨潮时沙洲都藏在水下——看不出什么区别。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He ended with rather forced cheerfulness, and quickly rolled up the chart. He had cut short the description of the last part of his journey. Why, I wondered? Perhaps he did not want me to realize how dangerous a voyage it had been. Whatever the reason, there was some mystery about it, and I wanted to know more.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他说完，匆匆卷起海图，很有几分强颜欢笑的感觉。最后这段航程他描述得很简短。为什么呢？我思忖着。也许他不想让我意识到这次航行有多么危险。不管什么原因，其中肯定有秘密，我想弄个清楚。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Looking at the books reminded me that I wanted to read his log-book, so, while Davies was washing the dishes, I took it down and began to read. There was much detailed description of winds, tides, and distances travelled each day. I turned to the later part, about his voyage to the Baltic. The log-book reached the 9th September, then the next page jumped to the 13th, and described the following three days with only the most basic details:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这些书提醒了我，我还想看看他的航海日志。于是趁戴维斯洗碗的时候，我便把日志取下来读。日志里有大量关于风向、潮汐、每日航行里程的详细描述。我把本子翻到后半部分，就是戴维斯来波罗的海那一段。我看到了9月9日的记录，可下一页就跳到了9月13日，而且接下来三天的记录只有最简单的一些信息。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">During supper we talked about war, and especially war at sea. This was Davies's hobby and he knew a lot about it. When he took a book from the shelf, I saw that his books were all about war at sea, or sailing in small boats.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="晚饭时我们谈起战争，谈得最多的是海战。这正是戴维斯的兴趣所在，他这方面知识甚是丰富。他从架子上拿一本书下来时，我发现他所有的书要么是关于海战的，要么是关于小型船只航行的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Again that night, we turned back to the shore, where we anchored. Among the trees, only a hundred metres away, we could see a little monument. We took the dinghy to investigate. It was a monument to those who had died in the war between Germany and Denmark, when the area became German. It was very simple, but, in the moonlight and the peace of the evening, it was very moving too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当天夜里，我们又回到岸边，抛锚停泊。就在100米开外的树丛里，我们看到一座小纪念碑，便乘着小船去探个究竟。原来，这是座纪念德丹战争死难者的纪念碑，这片地区就是在那时候归属德国的。在夜晚静谧的月光下，这简单的纪念碑竟也十分触人心弦。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You mean anywhere in the Baltic?" asked Davies.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你的意思是波罗的海的任何地方吗？”戴维斯问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes," Davies said doubtfully, "but I've heard it's difficult to get permission to shoot them here." He paused, then without looking at me, he added, "If we were in the North Sea, among the Frisian Islands, we wouldn't need permission."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“对，”戴维斯迟疑着说，“但我听说在这儿很难得到打野鸭的许可。”他顿了顿，然后看也不看我，补充道：“咱们要是在北海，在弗里西亚群岛中间，就不用许可了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You surely don't want to leave the Baltic?" I cried.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I'm sorry, old man," he said with a smile. "I'm being awfully selfish. You've been a real friend coming all this way to join me. Let's get to Schlei Fiord and ask about the ducks. We must be almost there."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“对不起，老兄，”他微笑着说，“是我太自私了。你大老远跑来陪我，只有真正的朋友才做得到。咱们去施莱湾问问打野鸭的事儿吧，肯定也快到那儿了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Why not?" he asked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“有何不可呢？”他问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But what for? What's the point…?" I was beginning to lose my patience, and was about to say something that would have ended our holiday there and then, but Davies spoke first.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可是去那儿干吗？有什么意义 ……”我渐渐失去了耐心，再说下去，我们的旅行肯定登时就杀青完戏了。还好戴维斯先开了口。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But, be sensible, man," I said crossly. "It's almost October, the summer's over, and the good weather's finished. Every yacht like ours is back in harbour for the winter. We've had the good luck to find these lovely fiords to sail in, and we've just seen there are ducks here. Why on earth make a long and dangerous voyage back to those islands in the North Sea?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可是你得理智点儿，老兄。”我有些恼了，“都快10月了，夏天过去了，好天气都结束了。像咱们这样的游艇都回到港口准备过冬了。咱们运气好，能找到这么漂亮的峡湾出海兜风，刚才还在这儿看到了野鸭。干吗要回北海那些岛去呢？路又远，又危险。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It wouldn't be very dangerous," he replied.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不会很危险的。”他回答。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We soon found the narrow entrance to the fiord and the pilot's little white house, where the fishermen had told Davies to ask about duck shooting. The pilot was very helpful, and told us the best places to look for ducks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们很快找到了峡湾狭窄的入口，还有引航员的白色小房子。渔民们之前就是让戴维斯来这里打听打野鸭的事儿的。引航员很热心，告诉了我们找野鸭的最佳地点。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Davies and I were friends again by the time we returned to the Dulcibella, and all thoughts of going to the Frisian Islands seemed forgotten. I went to bed, hoping for the chance of some duck shooting the next day, and expecting no more excitement than a sudden fierce storm blowing up the fiord. I had no way of knowing that my autumn holiday was about to turn into a very different kind of experience.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="回到“达尔茜贝拉”号时，我和戴维斯已经重归于好，去弗里西亚群岛的一切念头似乎都被打消了。我怀着第二天打野鸭的希望上了床，生怕峡湾会突然刮起猛烈的风暴。那时我全然不知，我的这次秋季旅行很快就要变成一场别开生面的冒险。">查看中文翻译</div>
