<div class="line_en">The first rhythm that they became used to was the slow swing from dawn to quick dusk. They accepted the pleasures of morning, the bright sun, the whelming sea and sweet air, as a time when play was good and life so full that hope was not necessary and therefore forgotten. Toward noon, as the floods of light fell more nearly to the perpendicular, the stark colors of the morning were smoothed in pearl and opalescence; and the heat -- as though the impending sun's height gave it momentum -- became a blow that they ducked, running to the shade and lying there, perhaps even sleeping.</div>

<div class="line_en">Strange things happened at midday. The glittering sea rose up, moved apart in planes of blatant impossibility; the coral reef and the few stunted palms that clung to the more elevated parts would float up into the sky, would quiver, be plucked apart, run like raindrops on a wire or be repeated as in an odd succession of mirrors. Sometimes land loomed where there was no land and flicked out like a bubble as the children watched. Piggy discounted all this learnedly as a "mirage"; and since no boy could reach even the reef over the stretch of water where the snapping sharks waited, they grew accustomed to these mysteries and ignored them, just as they ignored the miraculous, throbbing stars. At midday the illusions merged into the sky and there the sun gazed down like an angry eye. Then, at the end of the afternoon; the mirage subsided and the horizon became level and blue and clipped as the sun declined. That was another time of comparative coolness but menaced by the coming of the dark. When the sun sank, darkness dropped on the island like an extinguisher and soon the shelters were full of restlessness, under the remote stars.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="正午发生了各种希奇古怪的事情。闪闪发亮的海面上升着，往两边分开，显出根本不可能存在的许多平面；珊瑚礁和很少几株紧贴在礁石较高处的矮棕榈树好像要飘上天去，颤动着，被撕开来，像雨珠儿在电线上滚动，又像在排列古怪的许多面镜子中被折射。有时候，在原先没有陆地的地方隐约出现了陆地，而当孩子们聚精会神地注目时，陆地又像个气泡似的一晃就不见了。猪崽子颇有学问地把这一切说成只不过是“海市蜃楼”；因为没有一个孩子能够越过这一片海水到达珊瑚礁（在那儿可有咬人的鲨鱼等候着），大伙儿对这些神秘的现象习以为常，也不在意了，正如他们对闪烁着的、奇妙的群星也已经熟视无睹了一样。中午，各种幻影融进天空；在那上面，骄阳如怒目俯视着。然后，到傍晚时分，蜃景消退下去，海平面又回复了水平方向，又变成蓝蓝的，夕阳西下时，海平面轮廓清晰。那是一天中又一个比较凉快的时候，但吓人的黑夜也就要来临了。夕阳西沉以后，黑夜君临岛上，好像把一切都扑灭了；群星遥远，星光下的茅屋里传出了一阵阵骚动声。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Nevertheless, the northern European tradition of work, play, and food right through the day, made it possible for them to adjust themselves wholly to this new rhythm. The littlun Percival had early crawled into a shelter and stayed there for two days, talking, singing, and crying, till they thought him batty and were faintly amused. Ever since then he had been peaked, red-eyed, and miserable; a littiun who played little and cried often.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，按北欧传统，干活、游玩和吃喝都是从早到晚[1]进行的，所以孩子们不可能完全适应这种新的生活节奏。小家伙珀西佛尔老早就爬进了窝棚，在那儿待了两天，说呀、唱呀、哭呀，大家都认为他疯了，并感到有点好笑。从那以后他形容憔悴，眼睛红肿，变得可怜巴巴的；成了一个不玩尽哭的小家伙。【注：[1] 原文为day，在这里是指从早上到晚上入睡前这一段时间，如从早上六时到晚上十时。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The smaller boys were known now by the generic title of "littluns." The decrease in size, from Ralph down, was gradual; and though there was a dubious region inhabited by Simon and Robert and Maurice, nevertheless no one had any difficulty in recognizing biguns at one end and littluns at the other. The undoubted littluns, those aged about six, led a quite distinct, and at the same time intense, life of their own. They ate most of the day, picking fruit where they could reach it and not particular about ripeness and quality. They were used now to stomach-aches and a sort of chronic diarrhoea. They suffered untold terrors in the dark and huddled together for comfort. Apart from food and sleep, they found time for play, aimless and trivial, in the white sand by the bright water. They cried for their mothers much less often than might have been expected; they were very brown, and filthily dirty. They obeyed the summons of the conch, partly because Ralph blew it, and he was big enough to be a link with the adult world of authority; and partly because they enjoyed the entertainment of the assemblies. But otherwise they seldom bothered with the biguns and their passionately emotional and corporate life was their own.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="较小的男孩现在被通称为“小家伙们”。个子的大小从拉尔夫开始排下去；虽然西蒙、罗伯特和莫里斯三个人之间比较难以区别，但是在这些孩子们当中，大家伙们大、小家伙们小，却是任何人都不难辨认的。无疑应该算作是小家伙们的，大约六岁上下，他们过着一种很特别的、同时又是紧张的生活。他们白天大部分时间都在搞吃的，可以够得着的野果都摘来吃，也不管生熟好坏，现在对肚子痛和慢性腹泻都已经习惯了。他们感受到黑暗中的难以言传的种种恐怖，只好挤作一堆互相壮胆。除了吃睡之外，他们就找空玩耍；在明晃晃的水边，在白闪闪的沙滩上，漫无目的地玩耍，把时间打发过去。在这种环境里，孩子们本来会老是哭喊着叫娘的，但实际上这种情况的发生比人们所预料的要少得多；他们皮肤很黑，肮脏不堪。他们服从海螺的召唤，一来因为是拉尔夫吹的，拉尔夫是个大个子，他足以成为同权威的成人世界相联系的纽带；二来是因为他们喜欢聚在一起，把聚会当作娱乐。但是除此以外，他们很少去打扰大家伙，他们有他们自己感情热烈的、激动的共同生活。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Three were playing here now. Henry was the biggest of them. He was also a distant relative of that other boy whose mulberry-marked face had not been seen since the evening of the great fire; but he was not old enough to understand this, and if he had been told that the other boy had gone home in an aircraft, he would have accepted the statement without fuss or disbelief.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="眼下有三个正在这儿玩——亨利是其中最大的。他也是脸上长着紫红胎记男孩的远亲，那个孩子自从发生大火的那天夜里起就没有再露过面；但亨利还年幼，还不懂这个。要是有人告诉他那个孩子乘飞机回家了，他也会相信这个说法，一点都不感到惊讶。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They had built castles in the sand at the bar of the little river. These castles were about one foot high and were decorated with shells, withered flowers, and interesting stones. Round the castles was a complex of marks, tracks, walls, railway lines, that were of significance only if inspected with the eye at beach-level. The littluns played here, if not happily at least with absorbed attention; and often as many as three of them would play the same game together.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们在小河的沙洲上用沙子堆起各式城堡。这些城堡高约一英尺，并以各种贝壳、凋谢的花朵和好玩的石子装饰起来。围绕着城堡的是各种标记、小路、围墙、铁路线，但只有在靠近海滩平面看去才看得清是这些东西。小家伙们在这儿玩耍着，如果说并不快乐，至少也入了迷；而且常常会三个小家伙在一起玩同一个游戏。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Henry was a bit of a leader this afternoon, because the other two were Percival and Johnny, the smallest boys on the island. Percival was mouse-colored and had not been very attractive even to his mother; Johnny was well built, with fair hair and a natural belligerence. Just now he was being obedient because he was interested; and the three children, kneeling in the sand, were at peace.</div>

<div class="line_en">Roger and Maurice came out of the forest. They were relieved from duty at the fire and had come down for a swim. Roger led the way straight through the castles, kicking them over, burying the flowers, scattering the chosen stones. Maurice followed, laughing, and added to the destruction. The three littluns paused in their game and looked up. As it happened, the particular marks in which they were interested had not been touched, so they made no protest. Only Percival began to whimper with an eyeful of sand and Maurice hurried away. In his other life Maurice had received chastisement for filling a younger eye with sand. Now, though there was no parent to let fall a heavy hand, Maurice still felt the unease of wrongdoing. At the back of his mind formed the uncertain outlines of an excuse. He muttered something about a swim and broke into a trot.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时罗杰和莫里斯走出了森林。他们刚下管火的岗，下来准备游泳的。罗杰带路直闯，他一脚踢倒城堡，把花朵埋入了沙子里，并打散了三个小家伙收集来的石子。莫里斯跟着，一边笑，一边把城堡破坏得更厉害。三个小家伙停止游戏，仰脸呆看着。事情发生的当口儿，他们感兴趣的特别标记还没被触及，所以尚未表示出强烈的不满。只有珀西佛尔因一只眼睛弄进沙子呜呜地哭了，莫里斯赶忙走开。以前莫里斯曾因把沙子弄进一个小孩的眼睛而受过惩罚。眼下，尽管不会有爸爸或妈妈来严厉地教训他，莫里斯仍感到做了错事而忐忑不安。他在心里编造出一个含糊的借口，嘴里嘟囔着游泳什么的，撒腿快步跑开了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Roger remained, watching the littluns. He was not noticeably darker than when he had dropped in, but the shock of black hair, down his nape and low on his forehead, seemed to suit his gloomy face and made what had seemed at first an unsociable remoteness into something forbidding. Percival finished his whimper and went on playing, for the tears had washed the sand away. Johnny watched him with china-blue eyes; then began to fling up sand in a shower, and presently Percival was crying again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="罗杰还待在那里看着小家伙们。他比刚上岛那阵子黑不了多少，但是一头稻草堆似的黑头发，在后面长长地披在颈部，在前面低得覆盖了前额，似乎倒很配他那张阴沉沉的面孔，使人看了起初只觉得有一种陌生和不好相处的感觉，现在却感到很可怕了。珀西佛尔不再啜泣，继续玩着，因为泪水已经冲掉了眼中的沙子。约翰尼蓝灰色的双眼看着他，随后抓起沙子往空中撒去；一会儿珀西佛尔又哭了起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This was fascinating to Henry. He poked about with a bit of stick, that itself was wave-worn and whitened and a vagrant, and tried to control the motions of the scavengers. He made little runnels that the tide filled and tried to crowd them with creatures. He became absorbed beyond mere happiness as he felt himself exercising control over living things. He talked to them, urging them, ordering them. Driven back by the tide, his footprints became bays in which they were trapped and gave him the illusion of mastery. He squatted on his hams at the water's edge, bowed, with a shock of hair falling over his forehead and past his eyes, and the afternoon sun emptied down invisible arrows.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这可把亨利迷住了。他拿着一段木棒拨弄着，这木棒已被海水冲刷得发白，随波漂动着，被他拎在手里，他想用这木棒控制这些清扫者的活动。他划了一道道小沟，让潮水将其灌满，尽量在里面塞满小生物。他全神贯注，此刻的心情不是单纯的快乐，他感到自己在行使着对许多活东西的控制权。亨利跟它们讲话，催促它们这样那样，对它们发号施令。海潮把他往岸的深处赶，他的脚印所形成的一个个小坑截住了一些小生物，这又使他产生了一种自己是主宰的错觉。他盘腿坐在水边，弯着腰，乱蓬蓬的头发覆盖着前额，遮过眼睛；下午的骄阳正倾射出无数无形的毒箭。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When Henry tired of his play and wandered off along the beach, Roger followed him, keeping beneath the palms and drifting casually in the same direction. Henry walked at a distance from the palms and the shade because he was too young to keep himself out of the sun. He went down the beach and busied himself at the water's edge. The great Pacific tide was coming in and every few seconds the relatively still water of the lagoon heaved forwards an inch. There were creatures that lived in this last fling of the sea, tiny transparencies that came questing in with the water over the hot, dry sand. With impalpable organs of sense they examined this new field. Perhaps food had appeared where at the last incursion there had been none; bird droppings, insects perhaps, any of the strewn detritus of landward life. Like a myriad of tiny teeth in a saw, the transparencies came scavenging over the beach.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="亨利玩腻以后，就沿着海滩闲荡开去，罗杰尾随着他，在棕榈树底下跟他朝同一个方向慢悠悠地逛。亨利与棕榈树隔开着一段距离，他年纪太小，还不懂得避开毒日头，所以没有沿着树阴向前。他走下海滩，在水边忙起来。浩瀚的太平洋正在涨潮，每隔几秒钟，比较平静的环礁湖水就上涨一英寸。在这最近一次上涨的海水中有一些小生物，随着海潮漫上烫人而干燥的沙滩，这些小小的透明生物前来探索。它们用人们难以识别的感官考察着这片新的地域。在上一次海潮侵袭把食料一卷而光的地方，现在又出现了种种食料：也许是鸟粪，也许是小虫，总之是散在四处的、陆上生物的碎屑。这些小小的透明生物，像无数会动的小锯齿，前来清扫海滩。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A sudden breeze shook the fringe of palm trees, so that the fronds tossed and fluttered. Sixty feet above Roger, several nuts, fibrous lumps as big as rugby balls, were loosed from their stems. They fell about him with a series of hard thumps and he was not touched. Roger did not consider his escape, but looked from the nuts to Henry and back again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一阵突如其来的微风拂过棕榈树林的边缘，簇叶摇曳抖动起来。在罗杰上方约六十英尺的地方，一串像橄榄球大小的、纤维质块的棕榈果，从叶梗上松落下来。它们接二连三地掉在他的周围，砰然着地，可没砸到他。罗杰没想要避一避，他看看棕榈果，又看看亨利，再看看棕榈果。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Roger waited too. At first he had hidden behind a great palm; but Henry's absorption with the transparencies was so obvious that at last he stood out in full view. He looked along the beach. Percival had gone off, crying, and Johnny was left in triumphant possession of the castles, He sat there, crooning to himself and throwing sand at an imaginary Percival. Beyond him, Roger could see the platform and the glints of spray where Ralph and Simon and Piggy and Maurice were diving in the pool. He listened carefully but could only just hear them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="罗杰也等着。起先他躲在一株大棕榈树身的背后；但当他十分清楚地看到亨利被透明的小生物迷住了的时候，就一点也不隐蔽地站了出来。罗杰沿着海滩放眼望去。珀西佛尔已哭着走开了，剩下约翰尼得意扬扬地占有着城堡。他坐在那里，自个儿哼哼唱唱，并朝假想的珀西佛尔扔着沙子。从约翰尼处再往远去，罗杰可以看到平台，看到水花的闪光，拉尔夫、西蒙、猪崽子和莫里斯正往潭里跳水；他用心地听他们在讲些什么，但只能依稀地听到点声音。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The subsoil beneath the palm trees was a raised beach, and generations of palms had worked loose in this the stones that had lain on the sands of another shore. Roger stooped, picked up a stone, aimed, and threw it at Henry -- threw it to miss. The stone, that token of preposterous time, bounced five yards to Henry's right and fell in the water. Roger gathered a handful of stones and began to throw them. Yet there was a space round Henry, perhaps six yards in diameter, into which he dare not throw. Here, invisible yet strong, was the taboo of the old life. Round the squatting child was the protection of parents and school and policemen and the law. Roger's arm was conditioned by a civilization that knew nothing of him and was in ruins.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="棕榈树下的底土是一块高起的滩地；世代相生的棕榈树在这底土里把原先是铺在另一块海岸边的沙滩上的石子都弄松了。罗杰弯腰捡起一块石子，瞄了瞄，朝亨利扔去——可没扔中。石子——荒唐岁月的象征——在亨利右面五码处弹起，掉进水里。罗杰收集了一把石子，又开始扔起来。可亨利周围有一个直径约六码的范围，罗杰不敢往里扔石子。在这儿，旧生活的禁忌虽然无形无影，却仍然是强有力的。席地而坐的孩子的四周，有着父母、学校、警察和法律的庇护。罗杰的手臂受到文明的制约，虽然这文明对他一无所知并且已经毁灭了。">查看中文翻译</div>

This side and that the stones fell, and Henry turned obediently but always too late to see the stones in the air. At last he saw one and laughed, looking for the friend who was teasing him. But Roger had whipped behind the palm again, was leaning against it breathing quickly, his eyelids fluttering. Then Henry lost interest in stones and wandered off.</div>

Beside the pool his sinewy body held up a mask that drew their eyes and appalled them. He began to dance and his laughter became a bloodthirsty snarling. He capered toward Bill, and the mask was a thing on its own, behind which Jack hid, liberated from shame and self-consciousness. The face of red and white and black swung through the air and jigged toward Bill. Bill started up laughing; then suddenly he fell silent and blundered away through the bushes.</div>
