<div class="line_en">In this state of schemes, and hopes, and connivance, June opened upon Hartfield. To Highbury in general it brought no material change. The Eltons were still talking of a visit from the Sucklings, and of the use to be made of their barouche-landau; and Jane Fairfax was still at her grandmother's; and as the return of the Campbells from Ireland was again delayed, and August, instead of Midsummer, fixed for it, she was likely to remain there full two months longer, provided at least she were able to defeat Mrs. Elton's activity in her service, and save herself from being hurried into a delightful situation against her will.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mr. Knightley, who, for some reason best known to himself, had certainly taken an early dislike to Frank Churchill, was only growing to dislike him more. He began to suspect him of some double dealing in his pursuit of Emma. That Emma was his object appeared indisputable. Every thing declared it; his own attentions, his father's hints, his mother-in-law's guarded silence; it was all in unison; words, conduct, discretion, and indiscretion, told the same story. But while so many were devoting him to Emma, and Emma herself making him over to Harriet, Mr. Knightley began to suspect him of some inclination to trifle with Jane Fairfax. He could not understand it; but there were symptoms of intelligence between them-he thought so at least -- symptoms of admiration on his side, which, having once observed, he could not persuade himself to think entirely void of meaning, however he might wish to escape any of Emma's errors of imagination. She was not present when the suspicion first arose. He was dining with the Randalls family, and Jane, at the Eltons'; and he had seen a look, more than a single look, at Miss Fairfax, which, from the admirer of Miss Woodhouse, seemed somewhat out of place. When he was again in their company, he could not help remembering what he had seen; nor could he avoid observations which, unless it were like Cowper and his fire at twilight, "Myself creating what I saw," brought him yet stronger suspicion of there being a something of private liking, of private understanding even, between Frank Churchill and Jane.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="奈特利先生出于他自己最清楚的原因，的确早就讨厌弗兰克·邱吉尔了，现在只是越发讨厌他了。他开始怀疑，他追求爱玛是耍两面手法。爱玛是他的追逐目标，这看来是毋庸置疑的。种种迹象都表明了这一点：他自己的献殷勤，他父亲的暗示，他继母的小心沉默，全都是一致的；言论也好，行动也罢，不管谨慎还是疏忽，都说明这么回事。可是，就在许多人认为他倾心于爱玛，而爱玛自己把他跟哈丽特扯在一起的时候，奈特利先生却开始怀疑他想玩弄简·费尔法克斯。他琢磨不透这件事，不过他们之间有些心照不宣的迹象——至少他是这么想的——弗兰克确有爱慕的迹象，他一旦有所察觉，就没法认为那是毫无意义的，不过他也许想要避免犯爱玛犯下的那种当然的错误。他最初起疑心的时候，她爱玛并不在场。当时，他正和兰多尔斯那家人，还有简，在埃尔顿家吃饭。他发现倾心于伍德豪斯小姐的那个人向费尔法克斯小姐瞅了一眼，而且不止瞅了一眼，这似乎有点出格了。后来他再跟他们俩在一起时，不由得又想起了他先前见到的情景。他免不了又要观察，这种观察，除非像暮色中考柏待在炉前：我自己创造了我见到的景象。他因此而越发怀疑弗兰克·邱吉尔和简之间有一种私下的好感，甚至是私下的默契。【注：威廉·考柏（1731—1800）：英国诗人，下面一行诗引自他的长诗《任务》中的“冬日黄昏”】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He had walked up one day after dinner, as he very often did, to spend his evening at Hartfield. Emma and Harriet were going to walk; he joined them; and, on returning, they fell in with a larger party, who, like themselves, judged it wisest to take their exercise early, as the weather threatened rain; Mr. and Mrs. Weston and their son, Miss Bates and her niece, who had accidentally met. They all united; and, on reaching Hartfield gates, Emma, who knew it was exactly the sort of visiting that would be welcome to her father, pressed them all to go in and drink tea with him. The Randalls party agreed to it immediately; and after a pretty long speech from Miss Bates, which few persons listened to, she also found it possible to accept dear Miss Woodhouse's most obliging invitation.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Why, to own the truth," cried Miss Bates, who had been trying in vain to be heard the last two minutes, "if I must speak on this subject, there is no denying that Mr. Frank Churchill might have-I do not mean to say that he did not dream it-I am sure I have sometimes the oddest dreams in the world-but if I am questioned about it, I must acknowledge that there was such an idea last spring; for Mrs. Perry herself mentioned it to my mother, and the Coles knew of it as well as ourselves-but it was quite a secret, known to nobody else, and only thought of about three days. Mrs. Perry was very anxious that he should have a carriage, and came to my mother in great spirits one morning because she thought she had prevailed. Jane, don't you remember grandmama's telling us of it when we got home? I forget where we had been walking to -- very likely to Randalls; yes, I think it was to Randalls. Mrs. Perry was always particularly fond of my mother-indeed I do not know who is not-and she had mentioned it to her in confidence; she had no objection to her telling us, of course, but it was not to go beyond: and, from that day to this, I never mentioned it to a soul that I know of. At the same time, I will not positively answer for my having never dropt a hint, because I know I do sometimes pop out a thing before I am aware. I am a talker, you know; I am rather a talker; and now and then I have let a thing escape me which I should not. I am not like Jane; I wish I were. I will answer for it she never betrayed the least thing in the world. Where is she? -- Oh! just behind. Perfectly remember Mrs. Perry's coming. -- Extraordinary dream, indeed!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“咳，说实话，”贝茨小姐大声说道，她刚才就想要人家听她说话，可惜没人听她的，“如果非要让我在这个问题上几句话，那就不可否认，弗兰克·邱吉尔先生也许——我不是说他没梦见——我有时候确实也做些最稀奇古怪的梦——不过，要是有人问起我这件事的话，我得承认今年春天他们是有过这么个想法。佩里太太亲口对我妈妈提起，科尔夫妇跟我们一样，也这件事——不过那完全是个秘密，别人都不知道，只酝酿了三天光景。佩里太太急于想让丈夫有辆马车，有天早上兴高采烈地来找我妈，她以为她已经说服了佩里先生。简，难道你不记得我们回到家里外婆就告诉我们了吗？我不记得我们上哪儿去了——很可能是兰多尔斯。是的，我想是兰多尔斯。佩里太太一向特别喜欢我妈妈——我还真不知道有谁不喜欢我妈妈的——她悄悄告诉了我妈妈，当然不反对我妈妈告诉我们，可是不能再外传了。从那天到现在，我从没向哪个熟人说起过。不过，我不敢担保我从没露过口风，因为我知道，我有时会不知不觉地说漏嘴。你们知道我爱说话，非常爱说话，时不时地要冒一句不该说的话。我不像简，要像她就好了。我敢说，她可从不透露一丁点的事。她哪儿去了？哦！就在后面。我清清楚楚地记得佩里太太来过。真是个奇特的梦啊！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They were entering the hall. Mr. Knightley's eyes had preceded Miss Bates's in a glance at Jane. From Frank Churchill's face, where he thought he saw confusion suppressed or laughed away, he had involuntarily turned to hers; but she was indeed behind, and too busy with her shawl. Mr. Weston had walked in. The two other gentlemen waited at the door to let her pass. Mr. Knightley suspected in Frank Churchill the determination of catching her eye -- he seemed watching her intently-in vain, however, if it were so -- Jane passed between them into the hall, and looked at neither.</div>

<div class="line_en">Emma was pleased with the thought; and producing the box, the table was quickly scattered over with alphabets, which no one seemed so much disposed to employ as their two selves. They were rapidly forming words for each other, or for any body else who would be puzzled. The quietness of the game made it particularly eligible for Mr. Woodhouse, who had often been distressed by the more animated sort, which Mr. Weston had occasionally introduced, and who now sat happily occupied in lamenting, with tender melancholy, over the departure of the "poor little boys," or in fondly pointing out, as he took up any stray letter near him, how beautifully Emma had written it.</div>

<div class="line_en">Frank Churchill placed a word before Miss Fairfax. She gave a slight glance round the table, and applied herself to it. Frank was next to Emma, Jane opposite to them-and Mr. Knightley so placed as to see them all; and it was his object to see as much as he could, with as little apparent observation. The word was discovered, and with a faint smile pushed away. If meant to be immediately mixed with the others, and buried from sight, she should have looked on the table instead of looking just across, for it was not mixed; and Harriet, eager after every fresh word, and finding out none, directly took it up, and fell to work. She was sitting by Mr. Knightley, and turned to him for help. The word was blunder; and as Harriet exultingly proclaimed it, there was a blush on Jane's cheek which gave it a meaning not otherwise ostensible. Mr. Knightley connected it with the dream; but how it could all be, was beyond his comprehension. How the delicacy, the discretion of his favourite could have been so lain asleep! He feared there must be some decided involvement. Disingenuousness and double dealing seemed to meet him at every turn. These letters were but the vehicle for gallantry and trick. It was a child's play, chosen to conceal a deeper game on Frank Churchill's part.</div>

<div class="line_en">With great indignation did he continue to observe him; with great alarm and distrust, to observe also his two blinded companions. He saw a short word prepared for Emma, and given to her with a look sly and demure. He saw that Emma had soon made it out, and found it highly entertaining, though it was something which she judged it proper to appear to censure; for she said, "Nonsense! for shame!" He heard Frank Churchill next say, with a glance towards Jane, "I will give it to her-shall I?" -- and as clearly heard Emma opposing it with eager laughing warmth.

<div class="line_en">It was done however. This gallant young man, who seemed to love without feeling, and to recommend himself without complaisance, directly handed over the word to Miss Fairfax, and with a particular degree of sedate civility entreated her to study it. Mr. Knightley's excessive curiosity to know what this word might be, made him seize every possible moment for darting his eye towards it, and it was not long before he saw it to be Dixon. Jane Fairfax's perception seemed to accompany his; her comprehension was certainly more equal to the covert meaning, the superior intelligence, of those five letters so arranged. She was evidently displeased; looked up, and seeing herself watched, blushed more deeply than he had ever perceived her, and saying only, "I did not know that proper names were allowed," pushed away the letters with even an angry spirit, and looked resolved to be engaged by no other word that could be offered. Her face was averted from those who had made the attack, and turned towards her aunt.</div>

<div class="line_en">He remained at Hartfield after all the rest, his thoughts full of what he had seen; so full, that when the candles came to assist his observations, he must-yes, he certainly must, as a friend -- an anxious friend-give Emma some hint, ask her some question. He could not see her in a situation of such danger, without trying to preserve her. It was his duty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="别人走了后，他还待在哈特菲尔德，脑子里尽着刚才见到的情景。他尽想着这些事，等拿来蜡烛的时候，他作为一个朋友——一个焦急的朋友——不得不——是的，的确不得不——提醒一下爱玛，问她一个问题。他不能眼她陷入危险的境地，而不救她一把。他有这个责任。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Emma was extremely confused. She could not endure to give him the true explanation; for though her suspicions were by no means removed, she was really ashamed of having ever imparted them.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Pray, Emma," said he, "may I ask in what lay the great amusement, the poignant sting of the last word given to you and Miss Fairfax? I saw the word, and am curious to know how it could be so very entertaining to the one, and so very distressing to the other."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“请问，爱玛，”他说，“我是否可以问一声：让你和费尔法克斯小姐猜的最后一个字有什么好玩的，又有什么值得气愤的？我看见那个字了，觉得很奇怪，怎么会使你们一个人感到那么有趣，使另一个人感到那么气恼。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh!" she cried in evident embarrassment, "it all meant nothing; a mere joke among ourselves."</div>

<div class="line_en">He had hoped she would speak again, but she did not. She would rather busy herself about any thing than speak. He sat a little while in doubt. A variety of evils crossed his mind. Interference -- fruitless interference. Emma's confusion, and the acknowledged intimacy, seemed to declare her affection engaged. Yet he would speak. He owed it to her, to risk any thing that might be involved in an unwelcome interference, rather than her welfare; to encounter any thing, rather than the remembrance of neglect in such a cause.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他本希望爱玛再说话，可她却没有说。让她做什么都可以，就是不想说话。奈特利先生满腹狐疑地坐了一会，脑海里闪过种种不祥的念头。干预——徒劳的干预。爱玛的慌张，那直言不讳的亲密关系，似乎都表明她已有了意中人。然而，他还是要说话。他对她负有责任，宁可冒险卷入不受欢迎的干预，也不能让她受到损害，宁可遭遇什么不测，也不要在将来后悔自己失职。">查看中文翻译</div>

I am delighted to find that you can vouchsafe to let your imagination wander-but it will not do -- very sorry to check you in your first essay-but indeed it will not do. There is no admiration between them, I do assure you; and the appearances which have caught you, have arisen from some peculiar circumstances-feelings rather of a totally different nature -- it is impossible exactly to explain: -- there is a good deal of nonsense in it-but the part which is capable of being communicated, which is sense, is, that they are as far from any attachment or admiration for one another, as any two beings in the world can be. That is, I presume it to be so on her side, and I can answer for its being so on his. I will answer for the gentleman's indifference."</div>

<div class="line_en">She spoke with a confidence which staggered, with a satisfaction which silenced, Mr. Knightley. She was in gay spirits, and would have prolonged the conversation, wanting to hear the particulars of his suspicions, every look described, and all the wheres and hows of a circumstance which highly entertained her: but his gaiety did not meet hers. He found he could not be useful, and his feelings were too much irritated for talking. That he might not be irritated into an absolute fever, by the fire which Mr. Woodhouse's tender habits required almost every evening throughout the year, he soon afterwards took a hasty leave, and walked home to the coolness and solitude of Donwell Abbey.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱玛这话时，那自信的口吻使奈特利先生大为震惊，那得意的神气又使他无言以对。她兴致勃勃，还想继续谈下去，听听他如何猜疑的细枝末节，听听他们如何眉目传情，以及她感兴趣的每件事的来龙去脉，不他的兴致却没她的那么高。他觉得自己帮不上什么忙，情绪受了刺激又不想说话。伍德豪斯先生已经养成了习惯，一年到头几乎天天晚上都要生起火炉，奈特利先生怕待在炉火旁边，给烤得心里也冒起火来，过了不多久便匆匆告辞，回去感受当维尔寺的冷清和寂寞。">查看中文翻译</div>
