<div class="line_en">Philip soon realised that the spirit which informed his friends was Cronshaw's. It was from him that Lawson got his paradoxes; and even Clutton, who strained after individuality, expressed himself in the terms he had insensibly acquired from the older man. It was his ideas that they bandied about at table, and on his authority they formed their judgments. They made up for the respect with which unconsciously they treated him by laughing at his foibles and lamenting his vices.</div>

<div class="line_en">They prided themselves on being alone in appreciating his genius; and though, with the contempt of youth for the follies of middle-age, they patronised him among themselves, they did not fail to look upon it as a feather in their caps if he had chosen a time when only one was there to be particularly wonderful. Cronshaw never came to Gravier's. For the last four years he had lived in squalid conditions with a woman whom only Lawson had once seen, in a tiny apartment on the sixth floor of one of the most dilapidated houses on the Quai des Grands Augustins: Lawson described with gusto the filth, the untidiness, the litter.</div>

<div class="line_en">But he would not deny himself the pleasure of giving picturesque details of the odours which met his nostril. With a fierce delight in his own realism he described the woman who had opened the door for him. She was dark, small, and fat, quite young, with black hair that seemed always on the point of coming down. She wore a slatternly blouse and no corsets. With her red cheeks, large sensual mouth, and shining, lewd eyes, she reminded you of the Bohemienne in the Louvre by Franz Hals. She had a flaunting vulgarity which amused and yet horrified. A scrubby, unwashed baby was playing on the floor. It was known that the slut deceived Cronshaw with the most worthless ragamuffins of the Quarter, and it was a mystery to the ingenuous youths who absorbed his wisdom over a cafe table that Cronshaw with his keen intellect and his passion for beauty could ally himself to such a creature. But he seemed to revel in the coarseness of her language and would often report some phrase which reeked of the gutter. He referred to her ironically as la fille de mon concierge. Cronshaw was very poor. He earned a bare subsistence by writing on the exhibitions of pictures for one or two English papers, and he did a certain amount of translating. He had been on the staff of an English paper in Paris, but had been dismissed for drunkenness; he still however did odd jobs for it, describing sales at the Hotel Drouot or the revues at music-halls. The life of Paris had got into his bones, and he would not change it, notwithstanding its squalor, drudgery, and hardship, for any other in the world. He remained there all through the year, even in summer when everyone he knew was away, and felt himself only at ease within a mile of the Boulevard St. Michel. But the curious thing was that he had never learnt to speak French passably, and he kept in his shabby clothes bought at La Belle Jardiniere an ineradicably English appearance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但他并不想就此打住，非要把那天鼻子遭的罪绘声绘色地描述一遍才行。他详细地形容了一下那个给他开门的女人：黑不溜秋的皮肤、又矮又胖的身材，年纪不大，松松的发髻好像随时会散开。她没穿紧身胸衣就直接套了一件衬衫，看上去不像什么正经人家。她的脸蛋红彤彤的，嘴唇看上去充满肉欲，一双亮晶晶的眼睛风情万种，就像卢浮宫里弗兰兹·哈尔斯画的那幅《波希米亚女人》。她恶俗得不加掩饰、低级得洋洋得意，这种人真是让人又想笑又害怕。屋里有个脏兮兮的小泥孩儿正趴在地上玩耍。据说这个荡妇经常给克朗肖戴绿帽，和拉丁区好些不三不四的小流氓都有一腿。可是在那些凑到克朗肖咖啡桌前就为了拾点牙慧的天真无知的年轻人眼里，这实在是难以接受的事：像克朗肖这样嗜美如命的聪明人竟然会找这么个破鞋凑合着过日子。而他本人呢，竟好像被这个庸妇的粗言俗语迷掉了魂，时不时还要学两句从她嘴里吐出来的粗话。他调侃这个女人为“看家娘们儿”。克朗肖穷得叮当响，靠着给一两家英语报纸写画展评论来勉强糊口，偶尔还会接些翻译的工作。他过去在巴黎的一家英语报社工作，后来因为酗酒贪杯丢了饭碗，但现在还赖在那里打零工，报道一下德鲁奥旅馆举办的拍卖会或者杂耍剧院上演的滑稽时事剧。他已经从骨至髓地适应了巴黎的生活，尽管在这儿过得像只阴沟老鼠一样又苦又累，四处碰壁，但他除了巴黎哪儿都不会去。一年到头，他像是在这儿生了根。即使到了夏天，所有他认识的人都去别处度假了，也不愿意离开圣米歇尔大街一步。让人不解的是，即便这样他也从来没学着把法语说利索，而且还一直穿着从“美丽园丁”商店里买的破衣烂衫，誓死不改自己英国佬的面貌。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I ought to have lived in the eighteen hundreds," he said himself. "What I want is a patron. I should have published my poems by subscription and dedicated them to a nobleman.

<div class="line_en">He liked new faces, and he took a fancy to Philip, who seemed to achieve the difficult feat of talking just enough to suggest conversation and not too much to prevent monologue. Philip was captivated. He did not realise that little that Cronshaw said was new. His personality in conversation had a curious power. He had a beautiful and a sonorous voice, and a manner of putting things which was irresistible to youth. All he said seemed to excite thought, and often on the way home Lawson and Philip would walk to and from one another's hotels, discussing some point which a chance word of Cronshaw had suggested. It was disconcerting to Philip, who had a youthful eagerness for results, that Cronshaw's poetry hardly came up to expectation. It had never been published in a volume, but most of it had appeared in periodicals; and after a good deal of persuasion Cronshaw brought down a bundle of pages torn out of The Yellow Book, The Saturday Review, and other journals, on each of which was a poem. Philip was taken aback to find that most of them reminded him either of Henley or of Swinburne. It needed the splendour of Cronshaw's delivery to make them personal. He expressed his disappointment to Lawson, who carelessly repeated his words; and next time Philip went to the Closerie des Lilas the poet turned to him with his sleek smile:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他喜欢新鲜的面孔，对菲利普很感兴趣。因为菲利普的话不多不少，刚刚好。说得太少总是让人很难与之交谈，而说得太多又影响他一个人滔滔不绝。克朗肖在菲利普心里很快就成了神一样的存在。他没有意识到克朗肖给自己说的东西其实早让他跟别人说烂了。作为一个聊天对象，克朗肖有着充满魔力的个性。他的声音悦耳洪亮，讲故事的方式总是让年轻一代的人听得欲罢不能。他说的每句话、每个字都能让人浮想联翩。菲利普和劳森就经常在回家的路上，为了议论克朗肖无意中提到的某个词而不知不觉地在两个人的住处之间走来走去，转个好几趟。菲利普和别的年轻人一样，都热衷于追求结果。他发现克朗肖的诗词实在离期望水平差得很远。克朗肖从没出过诗集，但他的诗大都发表在了杂志上。经过一番劝说，克朗肖终于抬回了一大摞从《黄皮季刊》《星期六评论》等杂志上撕下来的纸页，每页都刊着他的一首诗。菲利普惊讶地发现这些诗基本和亨利或斯温伯恩的作品如出一辙。把别人的文字东一块西一块地凑成自己的诗也需要一定的本领和造诣吧。菲利普向劳森抱怨，说自己对克朗肖很失望。而劳森又无意中把这些话捅出去，让克朗肖知道了。等到下次菲利普再去丁香园的时候，克朗肖嬉皮笑脸地朝他说：">查看中文翻译</div>

My right over them extends only as far as my power. What I can do is the only limit of what I may do. Because we are gregarious we live in society, and society holds together by means of force, force of arms (that is the policeman) and force of public opinion (that is Mrs. Grundy). You have society on one hand and the individual on the other: each is an organism striving for self-preservation. It is might against might. I stand alone, bound to accept society and not unwilling, since in return for the taxes I pay it protects me, a weakling, against the tyranny of another stronger than I am; but I submit to its laws because I must; I do not acknowledge their justice: I do not know justice, I only know power. And when I have paid for the policeman who protects me and, if I live in a country where conscription is in force, served in the army which guards my house and land from the invader, I am quits with society: for the rest I counter its might with my wiliness. It makes laws for its self-preservation, and if I break them it imprisons or kills me: it has the might to do so and therefore the right. If I break the laws I will accept the vengeance of the state, but I will not regard it as punishment nor shall I feel myself convicted of wrong-doing.

<div class="line_en">"You rear like a frightened colt, because I use a word to which your Christianity ascribes a deprecatory meaning. You have a hierarchy of values; pleasure is at the bottom of the ladder, and you speak with a little thrill of self-satisfaction, of duty, charity, and truthfulness. You think pleasure is only of the senses; the wretched slaves who manufactured your morality despised a satisfaction which they had small means of enjoying. You would not be so frightened if I had spoken of happiness instead of pleasure: it sounds less shocking, and your mind wanders from the sty of Epicurus to his garden. But I will speak of pleasure, for I see that men aim at that, and I do not know that they aim at happiness. It is pleasure that lurks in the practice of every one of your virtues. Man performs actions because they are good for him, and when they are good for other people as well they are thought virtuous: if he finds pleasure in giving alms he is charitable; if he finds pleasure in helping others he is benevolent; if he finds pleasure in working for society he is public-spirited; but it is for your private pleasure that you give twopence to a beggar as much as it is for my private pleasure that I drink another whiskey and soda. I, less of a humbug than you, neither applaud myself for my pleasure nor demand your admiration."</div>

<div class="line_en">"No. You put your question foolishly. What you mean is that people accept an immediate pain rather than an immediate pleasure. The objection is as foolish as your manner of putting it. It is clear that men accept an immediate pain rather than an immediate pleasure, but only because they expect a greater pleasure in the future. Often the pleasure is illusory, but their error in calculation is no refutation of the rule. You are puzzled because you cannot get over the idea that pleasures are only of the senses; but, child, a man who dies for his country dies because he likes it as surely as a man eats pickled cabbage because he likes it. It is a law of creation. If it were possible for men to prefer pain to pleasure the human race would have long since become extinct."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，你这问题问得太蠢了。其实你的意思是说人会选择即刻痛苦而不选择当下享乐。我要是反对这个说法，那就和你提出这个问题一样愚蠢了。的确，人会接受即刻的痛苦而非享乐，但这只是因为他们想在日后享受更大的乐子啊。快乐是飘渺虚幻的，但是就算快乐的程度难以计算也不能说这条普遍的规律有错啊。你现在想不通是因为你还觉得享乐是一种感官享受，可是，孩子，一个为国捐躯的人是因为他热爱自己的国家，这一行为其实就好比一个爱吃泡菜的人吃了很多腌白菜。这是造物主的法则。要是人真的喜欢受苦多于享乐，那人类早就灭亡了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He pointed to two persons who at that moment opened the door of the cafe, and, with a blast of cold air, entered. They were Levantines, itinerant vendors of cheap rugs, and each bore on his arm a bundle. It was Sunday evening, and the cafe was very full. They passed among the tables, and in that atmosphere heavy and discoloured with tobacco smoke, rank with humanity, they seemed to bring an air of mystery. They were clad in European, shabby clothes, their thin great-coats were threadbare, but each wore a tarbouch. Their faces were gray with cold. One was of middle age, with a black beard, but the other was a youth of eighteen, with a face deeply scarred by smallpox and with one eye only. They passed by Cronshaw and Philip.</div>
