<div class="line_en">It was dark in the Skirling Pass. The great stone flanks of the mountains hid the sun for most of the day, so they rode in shadow, the breath of man and horse steaming in the cold air. Icy fingers of water trickled down from the snowpack above into small frozen pools that cracked and broke beneath the hooves of their garrons. Sometimes they would see a few weeds struggling from some crack in the rock or a splotch of pale lichen, but there was no grass, and they were above the trees now. The track was as steep as it was narrow, wending its way ever upward. Where the pass was so constricted that rangers had to go single file, Squire Dalbridge would take the lead, scanning the heights as he went, his longbow ever close to hand. It was said he had the keenest eyes in the Night's Watch.</div>

<div class="line_en">Jon saw the sense of that.

Qhorin Halfhand sat with his back to a rock, honing the edge of his longsword with long slow strokes. Jon watched the ranger for a few moments, then summoned his courage and went to him.

<div class="line_en">Jon did not think sleep would come easily, but he knew the Halfhand was right. He found a place out of the wind, beneath an overhang of rock, and took off his cloak to use it for a blanket. "Ghost," he called. "Here. To me." He always slept better with the great white wolf beside him; there was comfort in the smell of him, and welcome warmth in that shaggy pale fur. This time, though, Ghost did no more than look at him. Then he turned away and padded around the garrons, and quick as that he was gone. He wants to hunt, Jon thought. Perhaps there were goats in these mountains. The shadowcats must live on something. "Just don't try and bring down a 'cat," he muttered. Even for a direwolf, that would be dangerous. He tugged his cloak over him and stretched out beneath the rock.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="琼恩知道自己睡不着，但明白断掌确是好意。他在一块高悬的岩石下找到避风之所，合衣躺下，斗篷权当毯子。“白灵，”他唤道，“过来，到我这儿。”通常只要大白狼偎在身边会睡得比较香甜，他的气味让琼恩心安，那身蓬松的厚白毛更能带来久违的温暖。但这一次，白灵只看了他几眼，便转头绕着马儿小跑，旋即飞速逃开。他想打猎，琼恩心想，山里面说不定有山羊，影子山猫总得靠什么过活吧。“别太勉强喔，抓猫可不太好。”他呢喃道。即使对冰原狼而言，影子山猫也是个威胁。他拉起斗篷盖住自己，在岩石遮蔽下摊开身体。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There were five of them when there should have been six, and they were scattered, each apart from the others. He felt a deep ache of emptiness, a sense of incompleteness. The forest was vast and cold, and they were so small, so lost. His brothers were out there somewhere, and his sister, but he had lost their scent. He sat on his haunches and lifted his head to the darkening sky, and his cry echoed through the forest, a long lonely mournful sound. As it died away, he pricked up his ears, listening for an answer, but the only sound was the sigh of blowing snow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="六狼一体，五狼残存，分割天涯，互不联络。他只觉深沉的空虚和撕裂的疼痛。森林辽广清寒，他们如此渺小，如此失落。他知道兄弟姐妹就在某地，却嗅不出气息。于是他蜷身而坐，向着黑暗的天空仰天长嗥，叫声回荡在森林，成为悠长孤寂的哀叹。余音渐衰，他竖起耳朵，等待答复。惟一的回应是吹雪的叹息。">查看中文翻译</div>

The tree was slender compared to other weirwoods he had seen, no more than a sapling, yet it was growing as he watched, its limbs thickening as they reached for the sky.

Before him the Skirling Pass opened up into airy emptiness, and a long vee-shaped valley lay spread beneath him like a quilt, awash in all the colors of an autumn afternoon.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="猛然间，他又回到群山之中，只见自己站在一道巨大的悬崖边，爪子深深地插进雪堆。前方，风声峡已到尽头，展开成为无垠的空旷。一道长长的V字形河谷摆在身下，充盈着秋日午后所有的色彩。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A vast blue-white wall plugged one end of the vale, squeezing between the mountains as if it had shouldered them aside, and for a moment he thought he had dreamed himself back to Castle Black. Then he realized he was looking at a river of ice several thousand feet high. Under that glittering cold cliff was a great lake, its deep cobalt waters reflecting the snowcapped peaks that ringed it. There were men down in the valley, he saw now; many men, thousands, a huge host. Some were tearing great holes in the half-frozen ground, while others trained for war. He watched as a swarming mass of riders charged a shield wall, astride horses no larger than ants. The sound of their mock battle was a rustling of steel leaves, drifting faintly on the wind. Their encampment had no plan to it; he saw no ditches, no sharpened stakes, no neat rows of horse lines. Everywhere crude earthen shelters and hide tents sprouted haphazardly, like a pox on the face of the earth. He spied untidy mounds of hay, smelled goats and sheep, horses and pigs, dogs in great profusion. Tendrils of dark smoke rose from a thousand cookfires.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="谷地尽头，有一道硕大无朋的蓝白巨墙，紧贴着山，好似要把两山挤开。一时之间，他以为自己梦回黑城堡，但随即发现这不过是道数千尺高的冰川。寒光闪烁的冰壁下，有一个雄伟的湖泊，蓝钻般的深水映射着四周雪峰的辉芒。峡谷里有人，他看清了：有好多人，成千上万，拥挤不堪。有的在半冻的土地上挖大坑，其他人则操练战斗。他看见大群骑兵冲击一道盾墙，胯下的马如蚁蝼般渺小。演习的声音好似铁叶瑟瑟拂动，轻微地悬荡在风中。他们的营地毫无规划，杂乱无章：既无沟渠，更无尖桩，连马匹也未整备成列。随处可见土制陋屋，兽皮帐篷萌生出来，犹如大地这张脸上长的痘疹。他望着凌乱的干草堆，闻到山羊、绵羊、马、猪和狗发出的浓郁气味，黑烟如卷须般自千堆营火袅袅上升。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then a sudden gust of cold made his fur stand up, and the air thrilled to the sound of wings.

He watched it more closely and saw that it was not dirt at all, but alive, a shaggy lumbering beast with a snake for a nose and tusks larger than those of the greatest boar that had ever lived.

<div class="line_en">"There was a tree with my brother's face. The wildlings… there were thousands, more than I ever knew existed. And giants riding mammoths." From the way the light had shifted, Jon judged that he had been asleep for four or five hours. His head ached, and the back of his neck where the talons had burned through him. But that was in the dream.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那里有棵树，长着我弟弟的脸庞。有野人…成千上万的野人，我从来不知他们有那么多，还有骑长毛象的巨人。”透过天光的变化，琼恩判断自己已睡了四五个钟头。他头痛欲裂，后颈处因爪牙的攻击而灼痛。可那是梦啊。">查看中文翻译</div>

Or it may be that you saw what waits for us, a few hours farther on. Tell me." it made him feel half a fool to talk of such things to Qhorin and the other rangers, but he did as he was commanded. None of the black brothers laughed at him, however. By the time he was done, even Squire Dalbridge was no longer smiling.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那是狼梦，”断掌说，“卡斯特告诉总司令，野人们正在乳河源头集结。或许因为这个，你做这个梦；或许你是真看见了等待着我们的东西，远远提前于我们的脚步。不管怎样，告诉我实情。”把这些事说给科林和其他游骑兵听，让他觉得自己像个蠢蛋，但必须服从命令。奇怪的是，听完之后，没一个黑衣兄弟笑话他，连侍从戴里吉也收起笑容。">查看中文翻译</div>

The shadows covered the floor of the pass by then, and the sun was sinking fast toward the jagged twin peaks of the huge mountain the rangers named Forktop.

<div class="line_en">The last ray of sun vanished behind the peaks of Forktop. Twilight filled the Skirling Pass. It seemed to grow colder almost at once. They were no longer climbing. In fact, the ground had begun to descend, though as yet not sharply. It was littered with cracks and broken boulders and tumbled heaps of rock. It will be dark soon, and still no sight of Ghost. It was tearing Jon apart, yet he dare not shout for the direwolf as he would have liked. Other things might be listening as well.</div>

<div class="line_en">Together they washed the caked blood from the direwolf's fur. Ghost struggled and bared his teeth when Qhorm poured the wine into the ragged red gashes the eagle had left him, but Jon wrapped his arms around him and murmured soothing words, and soon enough the wolf quieted. By the time they'd ripped a strip from Jon's cloak to wrap the wounds, full dark had settled. Only a dusting of stars set the black of sky apart from the black of stone. "Do we press on?" Stonesnake wanted to know.</div>

Sometimes it was so dark that they dismounted and went ahead on foot, each man leading his garron. Once Ebben suggested that some torches might serve them well, but Qhorin said, "No fire," and that was the end of that. They reached the stone bridge at the summit and began to descend again. Off in the darkness a shadowcat screamed in fury, its voice bouncing off the rocks so it seemed as though a dozen other 'cats were giving answer.
