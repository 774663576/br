<div class="line_en">Clarice was waiting for me in my bedroom. She looked pale and scared. As soon as she saw me she burst into tears. I did not say anything. I began tearing at the hooks of my dress, ripping the stuff. I could not manage them properly, and Clarice came to help me, still crying noisily.</div>

And time will mellow it, make it a moment for laughter. But now it was not funny, now I did not laugh. It was not the future, it was the present. It was too vivid and too real.

<div class="line_en">"Oh, my dear, don't thank me. I wish I could do something." She stopped swiftly to my looking-glass and dabbed her face with powder. "God, what a sight I look," she said, "this damn! veil is crooked I know. However it can't be helped." She rustled out of the room, closing the door behind her. I felt I had forfeited her sympathy by my refusal to go down. I had shown the white feather. She had not understood. She belonged to another breed of men and women, another race than I. They had guts, the women of her race. They were not like me. If it had been Beatrice who had done this thing instead of me she would have put on her other dress and gone down again to welcome her guests. She would have stood by Giles's side, and shaken hands with people, a smile on her face. I could not do that. I had not the pride, I had not the guts. I was badly bred.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，亲爱的，别谢我。我真希望能帮你点什么忙。”她敏捷地弯下腰，对着我那面化妆镜一照。随手往脸上敷了些粉。“天哪，瞧我这副鬼样子，”她说。“我知道都是该死的面纱捣的鬼。这也真叫没办法。”她披着悉碎作声的袍子走了出去，顺手把门关上。我觉得由于自己拒绝下楼，已辜负了她对我的同情。我已暴露了我性格中怯懦的一面。可是她不理解我。她属于另外一个生活圈子，和我是不同类型的人。那个圈子里的女人，个个富有胆识，并不像我这么怯懦。要是这种事儿不是出在我身上，而是落在她比阿特丽斯头上，她就会另外换一套衣眼，重新走下楼去迎接客人。她会站在贾尔斯身边，跟大家—一握手寒喧，脸上还挂着微笑。在我，这可办不到。我缺少这股傲气和胆量，我缺乏良好的教养。">查看中文翻译</div>

There were tables and chairs in the rose-garden, for the couples who wanted to sit out. I could smell the roses from my window. The men were talking to one another and laughing. "There's one here gone," I heard a voice call out; "can you get me another small bulb? One of the blue ones, Bill." He fixed the light into position. He whistled a popular tune of the moment with easy confidence, and I thought how tonight perhaps the band would play the same tune in the minstrels' gallery above the hall. "That's got it," said the man, switching the light on and off, "they're all right here. No others gone. We'd better have a look at those on the terrace." They went off round the corner of the house, still whistling the song. I wished I could be the man. Later in the evening he would stand with his friend in the drive and watch the cars drive up to the house, his hands in his pockets, his cap on the back of his head. He would stand in a crowd with other people from the estate, and then drink cider at the long table arranged for them in one corner of the terrace. "Like the old days, isn't it?" he would say. But his friend would shake his head, puffing at his pipe. "This new one's not like our Mrs de Winter, she's different altogether." And a woman next them in the crowd would agree, other people too, all saying "That's right," and nodding their heads.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我从床沿站起，走到窗前向外凝望。园艺工人在玫瑰园里来回走动，忙着检查彩色灯泡，看看有没有毛病。天色渐暗，西边的天幕上，映出几片条纹状的橙红色晚霞。一到薄暮时分，华灯就会大放光明。玫瑰园里设了桌椅，成双配对的宾客要是愿意到户外小坐，可以上这儿来休憩。我从窗口可以闻到玫瑰的馨香。园艺工人正在谈笑。“这儿缺了一只，”我听到其中一个大声嚷嚷。“能替我另外拿只小灯泡来吗？比尔，蓝色的小灯泡。”他把灯泡装了上去，嘴里悠然自得地吹着口哨，吹的是一首时下流行的曲子。我想，说不定今晚乐队也会在俯瞰大厅的吟游诗人画廊里演奏这支曲子吧。“行啦，”那人说着，把灯开亮又关掉。“这儿的灯没问题了，一只也不缺。现在去看看平台那儿的彩灯吧。”他们拐过墙角走远了，嘴里还在吹着那支曲子。要是我能变个工匠该多好。到了晚上，双手往兜里一抄，帽子撩在后脑勺上，和朋友们一起站在车道上，看着汽车一辆辆开到宅子前。他会同庄园里的其他人，围作一堆，然后在平台一角专为他们设置的长桌上喝苹果酒。“又跟往日里一样啦，是不是？”工匠会这么说。可是他的朋友却会把脑袋一晃，吸口烟斗。“这位新太太可不像我们的德温特夫人，完全不一样。”接着旁边人群里有个妇女，还有别的一些人，也都随声附和：“说的是！”一面还一个劲儿点头。">查看中文翻译</div>

I went away from the window, back to the bed again. I picked up the white dress I had left on the floor and put it back in the box with the tissue paper. I put the wig back in its box too. Then I looked in one of my cupboards for the little portable iron I used to have in Monte Carlo for Mrs Van Hopper's dresses. It was lying at the back of a shelf with some woollen jumpers I had not worn for a long time. The iron was (The of those universal kinds that go on any voltage and I fitted it to the plug in the wall.

<div class="line_en">When I had finished I laid the dress ready on the bed. Then I cleaned the make-up off my face that I had put on for the fancy dress. I combed my hair, and washed my hands. I put on the blue dress and the shoes that went with it. I might have been my old self again, going down to the lounge of the hotel with Mrs Van Hopper. I opened the door of my room and went along the corridor. Everything was still and silent. There might not have been a party at all. I tiptoed to the end of the passage and turned the corner. The door to the west wing was closed. There was no sound of anything at all. When I came to the archway by the gallery and the staircase I heard the murmur and hum of conversation coming from the dining-room. They were still having dinner. The great hall was deserted. There was nobody in the gallery either. The band must be having their dinner too. I did not know what arrangements had been made for them. Frank had done it -- Frank or Mrs Danvers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="烫完后，我把衣服摊在床上，然后擦去脸上的脂粉，那是为配原先那件化装舞服面涂抹的。我梳了头，洗了手，穿上那件蓝袍，换了双与衣服相配的鞋子。我仿佛又同过去那时候一样了，正准备陪范—霍珀夫人下楼到旅馆的休息室去。我打开房门，沿走廊走去。四周静悄悄的，似乎根本没在举行什么宴会。我踮着脚，来到过道尽头，拐过弯去。通往西厢的那扇门紧闭着。走廊里没有一点声响。我走到画廊和楼梯处的拱门那儿，才听到餐厅里隐隐约约传来的嗡嗡谈话声。筵席还未散呢。大厅里空荡荡的，画廊里也不见人影。乐师们想必也在吃晚饭。我不清楚他们的起居饭食是怎么安排的。是弗兰克一手安排的——不是弗兰克，就是丹弗斯太太。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">From where I stood I could see the picture of Caroline de Winter facing me in the gallery. I could see the curls framing her face, and I could see the smile on her lips. I remembered the bishop's wife who had said to me that day I called, "I shall never forget her, dressed all in white, with that cloud of dark hair." I ought to have remembered that, I ought to have known. How queer the instruments looked in the gallery, the little stands for the music, the big drum. One of the men had left his handkerchief on a chair. I leant over the rail and looked down at the hall below. Soon it would be filled with people, like the bishop's wife had said, and Maxim would stand at the bottom of the stairs shaking hands with them as they came into the hall. The sound of their voices would echo to the ceiling, and then the band would play from the gallery where I was leaning now, the man with the violin smiling, swaying to the music.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从我站着的地方，可以看到正对着我的画廊里那张卡罗琳—德温特的画像。我可以看到那一络络发卷衬托着她的面庞，可以看到她嘴边挂着微笑。我记起那天拜访主教夫人时她对我说的话：“我怎么也忘不了她的模样儿，一身雪白的衣裳，满头乌黑的云鬓。”我怎么会把这些话忘了呢，我是应该知道的呀。搁在画廊里的那些乐器，那些小乐谱架，还有那张大鼓，看上去样子有多怪。不知哪位乐师把手帕丢在椅子上了。我凭靠栏杆，俯身望着下面的大厅。不多一会儿，大厅里就会像主教夫人说的那样宾客满堂，而迈克西姆就站在楼梯下，跟来客—一握手。嘈杂的人声将响彻大厅，随后，乐队在我现在凭栏伫立的画廊里管弦和鸣，那位提琴师将笑咪咪地合着音乐的节拍不住晃动身子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It would not be quiet like this any more. A board creaked in the gallery. I swung round, looking at the gallery behind me. There was nobody there. The gallery was empty, just as it had been before. A current of air blew in my face though, somebody must have left a window open in one of the passages. The hum of voices continued in the dining-room. I wondered why the board creaked when I had not moved at all. The warmth of the night perhaps, a swelling somewhere in the old wood. The draught still blew in my face though. A piece of music on one of the stands fluttered to the floor. I looked towards the archway above the stairs. The draught was coming from there. I went beneath the arch again, and when I came out on to the long corridor I saw that the door to the west wing had blown open and swung back against the wall. It was dark in the west passage, none of the lights had been turned on. I could feel the wind blowing on my face from an open window. I fumbled for a switch on the wall and could not find one. I could see the window in an angle of the passage, the curtain blowing softly, backwards and forwards. The grey evening light cast queer shadows on the floor. The sound of the sea came to me through the open window, the soft hissing sound of the ebb-tide leaving the shingle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到时候不会再像现在这么悄无声息。突然，画廊里的一块地板嘎吱响了一声。我赶快转身朝后面的画廊扫了一眼，但不见有人。画廊里跟刚才一样阒无一人。可是有阵冷风吹到我脸上，一定是谁把某条过道里的窗户打开后忘记关了。餐厅里嗡嗡的谈话声仍不断传来。真奇怪，我身子一动也没动，地板怎么会嘎吱作响呢。也许是因为夜晚太热，或者是地板木头年代太久，在哪一处有了翘棱。可是阵阵冷风仍往我脸上吹来。谱架上有张乐谱纸，抖动一下，翻落在地板上。我抬头朝楼梯上方的拱门望去。风是打那儿吹来的。我又来到拱门底下，当我走出拱门来到长廊时，我看到通西厢的那扇门被风吹开，门扉贴着墙壁。西厢走廊里黑洞洞的，一盏灯也没开。我可以感觉到风是从那儿某扇开着的窗子吹到我脸上来的。我伸手去摸墙上的开关，可是摸来摸去摸不着。我影影绰绰看见过道拐角处有扇窗开着，窗帷随风来回微微摆动。朦胧的暮色在地板上投下奇形怪状的影子。从洞开的窗户那儿传来大海的涛声，那是海潮从圆卵石海滩退出去时发出的轻柔的噬噬声。">查看中文翻译</div>

The same couples swung by in rotation, with the same fixed smiles, and to me, standing with Maxim at the bottom of the stairs to welcome the late-comers, these dancing couples seemed like marionettes twisting and turning on a piece of string, held by some invisible hand.</div>

<div class="line_en">I can see her now, the prominent teeth, the gay spot of rouge placed high upon her cheek-bones, and her smile, vacant, happy, enjoying her evening. Later I saw her by the supper table, her keen eyes searching the food, and she heaped a plate high with salmon and lobster mayonnaise and went off into a corner. There was Lady Crowan too, monstrous in purple, disguised as I know not what romantic figure of the past, it might have been Marie Antoinette or Nell Gwynne for all I knew, or a strange erotic combination of the two, and she kept exclaiming in excited high-pitch tones, a little higher than usual because of the champagne she had consumed, "You all have me to thank for this, not the de Winters at all."</div>

I wanted to go to Robert and stand beside him and say "I know how you feel. I understand. I've done worse than you tonight." I can feel now the stiff, set smile on my face that did not match the misery in my eyes. I can see Beatrice, dear friendly tactless Beatrice, watching me from her partner's arms, nodding encouragement, the bangles jangling on her wrists, the veil slipping continually from her overheated forehead. I can picture myself once more whirled round the room in a desperate dance with Giles, who with dog-like sympathy and kind heart would take no refusal, but must steer me through the stamping crowd as he would one of his own horses at a meet. "That's a jolly pretty dress you're wearing," I can hear him say, "it makes all these people look damn silly," and I blessed him for his pathetic simple gesture of understanding and sincerity, thinking, dear Giles, that I was disappointed in my dress, that I was worrying about my appearance, that I cared.</div>

He did not wear his pirate costume with abandon, and there was something rather tragic about the side-whiskers he had fluffed under the scarlet handkerchief on his head. I thought of him standing before the looking-glass in his bare bachelor bedroom curling them round his fingers. Poor Frank. Dear Frank.

The figure who stood beside it was wooden too. His face was a mask, his smile was not his own. The eyes were not the eyes of the man I loved, the man I knew. They looked through me and beyond me, cold, expressionless, to some place of pain and torture I could not enter, to some private, inward hell I could not share.</div>

We were like two performers in a play, but we were divided, we were not acting with one another.

God Save the King had taken her unawares, she was still holding a plate heaped with chicken in aspic. She held it stiffly out in front of her like a church collection.

<div class="line_en">Maxim had gone out to join Frank in the drive. Beatrice came up to me, pulling off her jangling bracelet. "I can't stand these things a moment longer. Heavens, I'm dead beat. I don't believe I've missed a dance. Anyway, it was a tremendous success."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈克西姆已经走出屋子，跟弗兰克一起站在车道上送客。比阿特丽斯一边朝我走来，一边卸下丁丁当当的手镯。“我再也受不了这些个劳什子。天哪，真把我累死了。我好像一场舞也没有错过。不管怎么说，这次舞会开得极为成功。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Please, Beatrice."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“谢谢你，比阿特丽斯。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You looked very charming in your blue. Everyone said so. And nobody had an inkling about -- about the other things, so you mustn't worry."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你穿着这套蓝衣裙很迷人。大家都这么说。关于——关于那件事儿，没有人听到一点风声，所以你大可不必放在心上。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"All right, my dear. Sleep well." She kissed me swiftly, patting my shoulder at the same time, and then went off to find Giles in the supper room. I walked slowly up the stairs, one step at a time. The band had turned the lights off in the gallery, and had gone down to have eggs and bacon too. Pieces of music lay about the floor. One chair had been upturned. There was an ashtray full of the stubs of their cigarettes. The aftermath of the party. I went along the corridor to my room. It was getting lighter every moment, and the birds had started singing. I did not have to turn on the light to undress. A little chill wind blew in from the open window. It was rather cold. Many people must have used the rose-garden during the evening, for all the chairs were moved, and dragged from their places.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好了，亲爱的，好好睡一觉。”她飞快地吻了我一下，又在我肩上轻轻一拍，随后就上冷餐室找贾尔斯去了。我蹒跚地一步一级跨上楼梯。乐师们已把画廊里的电灯关掉，下楼去吃鸡蛋和熏肉宵夜。乐谱散了一地。有把椅子翻倒在地。一只烟缸里盛满乐师们抽剩的烟蒂。这是舞会的余殃。我沿过道朝自己房间走去。天色一点点亮起来，鸟儿已经开始啁啾，脱衣时我已不必开灯。冷飕飕的晨风从窗口轻轻吹来，颇有几分寒意。夜间，一定有好多人到玫瑰园来过，因为所有的椅子都从原来的位置上挪开了…">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I got into bed, my legs very weary, a niggling pain in the small of my back. I lay back and closed my eyes, thankful for the cool white comfort of clean sheets. I wished my mind would rest like my body, relax, and pass to sleep. Not hum round in the way it did, jigging to music, whirling in a sea of faces. I pressed my hands over my eyes but they would not go.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我钻进被窝，感到两腿发沉，没一点力气，腰背隐隐作痛。我仰面躺下，阖上眼，洁白的床单给人一种凉爽舒适的感觉。我多么希望脑子也能像身躯一样得到休息，松驰下来，然后进入梦乡，而不是像现在这样不住地嗡嗡作响，随着音乐的节拍乱蹦乱跳，在脸庞的海洋中旋转。我用双手紧紧压住自己的眼睛，但是这些脸庞却仍在我脑海中徘徊不去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was a tray of empty glasses on one of the tables. Someone had left a bag behind on a chair. I pulled the curtain to darken the room, but the grey morning light found its way through the gaps at the side.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有张桌子上放着一盘空玻璃杯。不知谁把只手提包遗忘在一张椅子上。我把窗帷拉上，好让房间里暗一些，可是灰蒙蒙的晨曦还是从旁边的缝隙里透了进来">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I wondered how long Maxim would be. The bed beside me looked stark and cold. Soon there would be no shadows in the room at all, the walls and the ceiling and the floor would be white with the morning. The birds would sing their songs, louder, gayer, less subdued. The sun would make a yellow pattern on the curtain. My little bedside clock ticked out the minutes one by one. The hand moved round the dial. I lay on my side watching it. It came to the hour and passed it again. It started afresh on its journey. But Maxim did not come.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不知道迈克西姆还要等多少时间才回房来，我旁边的那张床看上去如此僵冷无情。要不了多久，屋子里的阴影全会消遁不见，墙壁、天花板和地板都会被朝阳照得白灿灿的。鸟儿不再压低嗓子，而是将唱得更响，更欢。阳光会在窗帷上织成黄澄澄的图案。床头小钟滴答作响，时间一秒一秒地过去。我侧转身子，望着时钟的针臂在钟面上缓缓移动。分外移到正点上，接着又转了过去，开始另一轮新的旅程。迈克西姆却始终没回房来">查看中文翻译</div>
