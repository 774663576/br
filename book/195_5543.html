<div class="line_en">He could not get her out of his mind. He laughed angrily at his own foolishness: it was absurd to care what an anaemic little waitress said to him; but he was strangely humiliated. Though no one knew of the humiliation but Dunsford, and he had certainly forgotten, Philip felt that he could have no peace till he had wiped it out. He thought over what he had better do. He made up his mind that he would go to the shop every day; it was obvious that he had made a disagreeable impression on her, but he thought he had the wits to eradicate it; he would take care not to say anything at which the most susceptible person could be offended. All this he did, but it had no effect. When he went in and said good-evening she answered with the same words, but when once he omitted to say it in order to see whether she would say it first, she said nothing at all. He murmured in his heart an expression which though frequently applicable to members of the female sex is not often used of them in polite society; but with an unmoved face he ordered his tea. He made up his mind not to speak a word, and left the shop without his usual good-night. He promised himself that he would not go any more, but the next day at tea-time he grew restless. He tried to think of other things, but he had no command over his thoughts. At last he said desperately:</div>

<div class="line_en">But that seemed to satisfy her curiosity. She went away and, since at that late hour there was nobody else at her tables, she immersed herself in a novelette. This was before the time of the sixpenny reprints. There was a regular supply of inexpensive fiction written to order by poor hacks for the consumption of the illiterate. Philip was elated; she had addressed him of her own accord; he saw the time approaching when his turn would come and he would tell her exactly what he thought of her. It would be a great comfort to express the immensity of his contempt. He looked at her. It was true that her profile was beautiful; it was extraordinary how English girls of that class had so often a perfection of outline which took your breath away, but it was as cold as marble; and the faint green of her delicate skin gave an impression of unhealthiness. All the waitresses were dressed alike, in plain black dresses, with a white apron, cuffs, and a small cap. On a half sheet of paper that he had in his pocket Philip made a sketch of her as she sat leaning over her book (she outlined the words with her lips as she read), and left it on the table when he went away. It was an inspiration, for next day, when he came in, she smiled at him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她好像把该问的都问完了，就这么转身走开了。晚上这个点她负责的几张桌子都空了，所以她聚精会神地捧着一本小说读了起来。那时候还没有现在市面上卖的廉价重印本，只有一些为满足毫无文学追求的读者而写的定期出版的蹩脚小说。菲利普现在像喝了蜜一样甜：她终于主动跟自己打招呼了，不如抓住这个机会把自己对她的看法一五一十地告诉她，把自己对她的鄙视之情一股脑地吐个痛快。她确实是个美人胚子。像她一样出身卑微的英国女孩很少会有这么完美的轮廓，只消看一眼，就会为她的美丽而震惊。可她的态度又冰冷得让人难以靠近，皮肤下透出的淡青色给人一种病怏怏的感觉。所有女侍者打扮都一样，式样简单的黑裙、白围裙、白袖口、小白帽。菲利普从口袋里掏出一张纸，给她画了半页素描。画上的她正低头读书，嘴唇微微启开，一个字一个字地默读。他走的时候把这张纸搁在桌上。这一招使得很妙，第二天他一来，女侍者冲他嫣然一笑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was silly of him to take offence at what she had said; it was doubtless his own fault; she had not meant to make herself disagreeable: he ought to be accustomed by now to making at first sight a bad impression on people. He was flattered at the success of his drawing; she looked upon him with more interest now that she was aware of this small talent. He was restless next day. He thought of going to lunch at the tea-shop, but he was certain there would be many people there then, and Mildred would not be able to talk to him. He had managed before this to get out of having tea with Dunsford, and, punctually at half past four (he had looked at his watch a dozen times), he went into the shop.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="为她的话生气这么久真是太傻了，这无疑都是自己的错。她不是故意表现得不友好的。他应该早点看清自己的毛病，每次都会留给别人糟糕的第一印象。好在那幅画真是画对了，她现在肯定觉得自己是个有趣的人，还有那么几分才华。第二天，菲利普一直喜气洋洋的，思忖着中午就到那家茶馆吃饭。可他又想到中午那里一定人满为患，估计米尔德里德腾不出多少空来和自己说话。可惜在搞明白这一点之前，他就已经说好不和邓斯福一起喝茶了，四点半一到，他准时走进了小餐馆（天知道他看了多少次表）。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Philip repeated every word of the conversation to himself as he limped home. She was quite friendly with him now. When opportunity arose he would offer to make a more finished sketch of her, he was sure she would like that; her face was interesting, the profile was lovely, and there was something curiously fascinating about the chlorotic colour. He tried to think what it was like; at first he thought of pea soup; but, driving away that idea angrily, he thought of the petals of a yellow rosebud when you tore it to pieces before it had burst. He had no ill-feeling towards her now.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="拖着瘸腿往家走的路上，菲利普把他俩的对话从头到尾回想了一遍。她现在终于对他友好多了。一等时机更成熟些，他就要提议给她正儿八经地画幅肖像，相信一定能赢得美人心。她的脸庞很有画头，轮廓也非常漂亮，就连那种不健康的肤色画出来都一定很值得玩味。要画成什么颜色好呢？一开始菲利普想到了豌豆汤，后来生气地把这个想法丢到一边；脑海里又浮现出含苞待放的黄玫瑰骨朵儿，还没开花呢，就被人撕个粉碎。他现在一点也不讨厌她了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mildred had her back turned to him. She was sitting down, talking to the German whom Philip had seen there every day till a fortnight ago and since then had not seen at all. She was laughing at what he said. Philip thought she had a common laugh, and it made him shudder. He called her, but she took no notice; he called her again; then, growing angry, for he was impatient, he rapped the table loudly with his stick. She approached sulkily.</div>

<div class="line_en">"If you'll give me my bill now I needn't trouble you again," he said icily.</div>

<div class="line_en">She wrote out the slip, placed it on the table, and went back to the German. Soon she was talking to him with animation. He was a man of middle height, with the round head of his nation and a sallow face; his moustache was large and bristling; he had on a tail-coat and gray trousers, and he wore a massive gold watch-chain. Philip thought the other girls looked from him to the pair at the table and exchanged significant glances. He felt certain they were laughing at him, and his blood boiled. He detested Mildred now with all his heart. He knew that the best thing he could do was to cease coming to the tea-shop, but he could not bear to think that he had been worsted in the affair, and he devised a plan to show her that he despised her. Next day he sat down at another table and ordered his tea from another waitress. Mildred's friend was there again and she was talking to him. She paid no attention to Philip, and so when he went out he chose a moment when she had to cross his path: as he passed he looked at her as though he had never seen her before. He repeated this for three or four days. He expected that presently she would take the opportunity to say something to him; he thought she would ask why he never came to one of her tables now, and he had prepared an answer charged with all the loathing he felt for her. He knew it was absurd to trouble, but he could not help himself. She had beaten him again. The German suddenly disappeared, but Philip still sat at other tables. She paid no attention to him. Suddenly he realised that what he did was a matter of complete indifference to her; he could go on in that way till doomsday, and it would have no effect.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她算好账，把账单放在桌上，找德国佬继续聊天去了。没一会儿，两个人就聊得热火朝天。德国佬不高不矮，长着德国男人特有的大脑袋，面如土色的脸上横生着一丛粗硬的大胡子。他穿件燕尾服和灰色的裤子，佩着一条粗粗的金表链。菲利普觉察出店里的其他女孩看看他，又看看那对男女，互相使起眼色。他敢说这些女孩都在暗暗嘲笑自己，气得全身血液都沸腾起来。他现在要恨死米尔德里德了。尽管知道最好的报复就是再也不来这家馆子，但他不能在这件事里白吃哑巴亏。他想出个办法，要让米尔德里德知道自己有多看不上她。第二天，他在餐馆找了张别人负责的桌子坐下，跟其他的女侍者点了餐。米尔德里德的德国朋友也在店里，两人照样相谈甚欢，她都没正眼瞧过菲利普。等她朝自己这个方向走过来的时候，菲利普找准时机起身出门，若无其事地瞧她一眼，就像看到陌生人一样。一连三四天，每天如此。他以为她会找个机会和自己说话，或者问问自己为什么不来她负责的桌子坐。他甚至已经想好要怎么回答，怎么把一肚子的不满统统发泄出来。这样大费周章真是可笑，可他根本控制不住自己。可是，这次米尔德里德又赢了。那个德国佬忽然人间蒸发，而他还坐在其他人负责的桌上。她始终不曾注意到他。菲利普这才醒悟，原来自己这番折腾根本对她一点影响也没，就算折腾到天荒地老，她也不会有什么反应。">查看中文翻译</div>
