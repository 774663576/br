<div class="line_en">With her desperate sadness she encysted herself within her house and her family, reclaimed that life she had been ready to renounce, lived laborious days and tried to drink, in toil, oblivion.

<div class="line_en">The death of Grover gave Eliza the most terrible wound of her life: her courage was snapped, her slow but powerful adventure toward freedom was abruptly stopped.

<div class="line_en">Secure and conscious now in the guarded and sufficient strength of home, he lay with well-lined belly before the roasting vitality of the fire, poring insatiably over great volumes in the bookcase, exulting in the musty odor of the leaves, and in the pungent smell of their hot hides. The books he delighted in most were three huge calf-skin volumes called Ridpath's History of the World. Their numberless pages were illustrated with hundreds of drawings, engravings, wood-cuts: he followed the progression of the centuries pictorially before he could read. The pictures of battle delighted him most of all. Exulting in the howl of the beaten wind about the house, the thunder of great trees, he committed himself to the dark storm, releasing the mad devil's hunger all men have in them, which lusts for darkness, the wind, and incalculable speed. The past unrolled to him in separate and enormous visions; he built unending legends upon the pictures of the kings of Egypt, charioted swiftly by soaring horses, and something infinitely old and recollective seemed to awaken in him as he looked on fabulous monsters, the twined beards and huge beast-bodies of Assyrian kings, the walls of Babylon. His brain swarmed with pictures -- Cyrus directing the charge, the spear-forest of the Macedonian phalanx, the splintered oars, the numberless huddle of the ships at Salamis, the feasts of Alexander, the terrific melee of the knights, the shattered lances, the axe and the sword, the massed pikemen, the beleaguered walls, the scaling ladders heavy with climbing men hurled backward, the Swiss who flung his body on the lances, the press of horse and foot, the gloomy forests of Gaul and Cæsarian conquests. Gant sat farther away, behind him, swinging violently back and forth in a stout rocker, spitting clean and powerful spurts of tobacco-juice over his son's head into the hissing fire.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在家庭的力量与保护下，尤金明显有了一种安全感，而且他也开始有了自己的思想。他一吃饱饭，就会趴在温暖的火炉旁，贪婪地阅读书柜里那些大部头的厚书，津津有味地品味书页的香味以及封面的浓重味道。他最喜欢看的书是三大本牛皮封面的《里迪帕斯世界史》。书中一页一页足有上百幅插图、版画和木刻。在他还没有开始识字之前，他早已靠这些图画认识了人类千百年的历史演变。他最兴奋的莫过于那些描绘战争场面的图画了。伴着屋外怒吼的狂风、大树的涛声，他会全身心地投入黑色的风暴里，发泄人人内心蕴藏的魔鬼般的野心，只贪求黑暗、狂风、极速的欲望。人类过去的一幕幕壮观场景在他眼前慢慢展开。他看见埃及的国王们御驾飞驰、战马嘶鸣，他能幻想出许多故事来。当他注视那些神话般的鬼怪、亚述王的胡须以及猛兽般健壮的身躯、巴比伦的城墙时，所有这些都能唤起他内心深处潜藏着的悠远回忆。他的整个脑海里全都是一幅幅图画——塞勒斯率领大军冲锋陷阵，马其顿军阵中枪杆矛头林立，塞拉米船上的士兵战战兢兢地挤在一起，碎裂的船桨，亚历山大的盛宴，武土们的拼杀，破枪烂剑，板斧砍刀，一群群的士兵，久攻不下的城墙，奋勇攀登又被掀翻在地的士兵，挂在矛尖头上的瑞士人，马踩人踏，高卢阴森的树林，恺撒大帝的征讨。甘特坐在小儿子身后，躺在一把摇椅里，使劲地来回摇晃着，偶尔越过儿子的脑袋，把浓浓的烟叶汁准确地吐进咝咝作响的炉火里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The family was at the very core and ripeness of its life together. Gant lavished upon it his abuse, his affection, and his prodigal provisioning. They came to look forward eagerly to his entrance, for he brought with him the great gusto of living, of ritual. They would watch him in the evening as he turned the corner below with eager strides, follow carefully the processional of his movements from the time he flung his provisions upon the kitchen table to the rekindling of his fire, with which he was always at odds when he entered, and on to which he poured wood, coal and kerosene lavishly. This done, he would remove his coat and wash himself at the basin vigorously, rubbing his great hands across his shaven, tough-bearded face with the cleansing and male sound of sandpaper. Then he would thrust his body against the door jamb and scratch his back energetically by moving it violently to and fro. This done, he would empty another half can of kerosene on the howling flame, lunging savagely at it, and muttering to himself.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then, biting off a good hunk of powerful apple tobacco, which lay ready for his use on the mantel, he would pace back and forth across his room fiercely, oblivious of his grinning family who followed these ceremonies with exultant excitement, as he composed his tirade. Finally, he would burst in on Eliza in the kitchen, plunging to the heart of denunciation with a mad howl.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后，他从炉架上取下早已准备好的苹果牌烟草，咬下一大段放进嘴里嚼了起来。他在屋子里来回踱着步子，同时绞尽脑汁思考着骂人的话，全然没有觉察到一家人兴奋的偷视。最后，他冲进厨房，突然出现在伊丽莎的面前，冲着她一边大声地吼叫，一边高声辱骂起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His turbulent and undisciplined rhetoric had acquired, by the regular convention of its usage, something of the movement and directness of classical epithet: his similes were preposterous, created really in a spirit of vulgar mirth, and the great comic intelligence that was in the family -- down to the youngest -- was shaken daily by it. The children grew to await his return in the evening with a kind of exhilaration. Indeed, Eliza herself, healing slowly and painfully her great hurt, got a certain stimulation from it; but there was still in her a fear of the periods of drunkenness, and latently, a stubborn and unforgiving recollection of the past.</div>

<div class="line_en">But, during that winter, as death, assaulted by the quick and healing gaiety of children, those absolute little gods of the moment, lifted itself slowly out of their hearts, something like hopefulness returned to her. They were a life unto themselves -- how lonely they were they did not know, but they were known to every one and friended by almost no one. Their status was singular -- if they could have been distinguished by caste, they would probably have been called middle-class, but the Duncans, the Tarkintons, all their neighbors, and all their acquaintances throughout the town, never drew in to them, never came into the strange rich color of their lives, because they had twisted the design of all orderly life, because there was in them a mad, original, disturbing quality which they did not suspect. And companionship with the elect -- those like the Hilliards -- was equally impossible, even if they had had the gift or the desire for it. But they hadn't.</div>

Cr-unch, Cr-unch, Cr-unch,"-- they were all exploded with laughter as his face assumed an expression of insane gluttony, and as he continued, in a slow, whining voice intended to represent the speech of the late Major: "'Eliza, if you don't mind I'll have some more of that chicken,' when the old scoundrel had shovelled it down his throat so fast we had to carry him away from the table."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可是他们自己才算真能吃呢！”他突然跳到厨房门口大声地喊起来。“他们可真能吃啊——只要有人给吃的。我这一辈子都忘不了‘老猪’的那副吃相，嘎吱嘎吱嘎吱地咬着嚼着。”一听到这句话，孩子们全都哄笑起来，而他的脸上却露出一副愚蠢的馋相，拖着长长的调子想故意模仿已故岳父的那副贪婪样子：“‘伊丽莎，你要是不介意，能不能再给我来点鸡肉？’其实那个老家伙早已经吃得肚子溜圆了，我们只得把他从餐桌旁给抬走。”">查看中文翻译</div>

Get away from me! It's too late for that now." Her white embarrassed smile was at once painful and comic: tears pressed closely behind it.

"It's kept me a poor man all my life, and when I die they'll have to give me six feet of earth in Pauper's Field." And he would grow broodingly philosophic, speaking of the vanity of human effort, the last resting-place in earth of rich and poor, the significant fact that we could "take none of it with us," ending perhaps with "Ah me! It all comes to the same in the end, anyway."</div>

We could have been getting forty dollars a month rent on them ever since."</div>

<div class="line_en">Gant, for all his hatred of land ownership, was proud of living under his own shelter, and indeed proud in the possession of anything that was sanctified by his usage, and that gave him comfort. He would have liked ready and unencumbered affluence -- the possession of huge sums of money in the bank and in his pocket, the freedom to travel grandly, to go before the world spaciously. He liked to carry large sums of money in his pocket, a practice of which Eliza disapproved, and for which she reprimanded him frequently. Once or twice, when he was drunk, he had been robbed: he would brandish a roll of bills about under the stimulation of whisky, and dispense large sums to his children -- ten, twenty, fifty dollars to each, with maudlin injunctions to "take it all! Take it all, God damn it!" But next day he was equally assiduous in his demands for its return: Helen usually collected it from the sometimes unwilling fingers of the boys. She would give it to him next day. She was fifteen or sixteen years old, and almost six feet high: a tall thin girl, with large hands and feet, big-boned, generous features, behind which the hysteria of constant excitement lurked.</div>

<div class="line_en">The bond between the girl and her father grew stronger every day: she was nervous, intense, irritable, and abusive as he was. She adored him. He had begun to suspect that this devotion, and his own response to it, was a cause more and more of annoyance to Eliza, and he was inclined to exaggerate and emphasize it, particularly when he was drunk, when his furious distaste for his wife, his obscene complaint against her, was crudely balanced by his maudlin docility to the girl.</div>

<div class="line_en">The friction between Helen and Eliza was often acute: they spoke sharply and curtly to each other, and were painfully aware of the other's presence in cramped quarters.

Gant bought whole hogs from the butcher, returning home early to salt them, wearing a long work-apron, and rolling his sleeves half up his lean hairy arms. Smoked bacons hung in the pantry, the great bins were full of flour, the dark recessed shelves groaned with preserved cherries, peaches, plums, quinces, apples, pears. All that he touched waxed in rich pungent life: his Spring gardens, wrought in the black wet earth below the fruit trees, flourished in huge crinkled lettuces that wrenched cleanly from the loamy soil with small black clots stuck to their crisp stocks; fat red radishes; heavy tomatoes. The rich plums lay bursted on the grass; his huge cherry trees oozed with heavy gum jewels; his apple trees bent with thick green clusters. The earth was spermy for him like a big woman.</div>

<div class="line_en">For the Thanksgiving and Christmas feasts four heavy turkeys were bought and fattened for weeks: Eugene fed them with cans of shelled corn several times a day, but he could not bear to be present at their executions, because by that time their cheerful excited gobbles made echoes in his heart. Eliza baked for weeks in advance: the whole energy of the family focussed upon the great ritual of the feast. A day or two before, the auxiliary dainties arrived in piled grocer's boxes -- the magic of strange foods and fruits was added to familiar fare: there were glossed sticky dates, cold rich figs, cramped belly to belly in small boxes, dusty raisins, mixed nuts -- the almond, pecan, the meaty nigger-toe, the walnut, sacks of assorted candies, piles of yellow Florida oranges, tangerines, sharp, acrid, nostalgic odors.</div>

At the mid-day meal, they ate heavily: a huge hot roast of beef, fat buttered lima-beans, tender corn smoking on the cob, thick red slabs of sliced tomatoes, rough savory spinach, hot yellow corn-bread, flaky biscuits, a deep-dish peach and apple cobbler spiced with cinnamon, tender cabbage, deep glass dishes piled with preserved fruits -- cherries, pears, peaches.
