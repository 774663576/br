<div class="line_en">Barack Obama was late on day one. I sat in my office on the forty-seventh floor, waiting and not waiting for him to arrive. Like most first-year lawyers, I was busy. I put in long hours at Sidley &amp; Austin, often eating both lunch and dinner at my desk while combating a continuous flow of documents, all of them written in precise and decorous lawyer-language. I read memos, I wrote memos, I edited other people's memos. At this point, I thought of myself basically as trilingual. I knew the relaxed patois of the South Side and the high-minded diction of the Ivy League, and now on top of that I spoke Lawyer, too. I'd been hired into the firm's marketing and intellectual property practice group, which was considered internally more freewheeling and creative than other groups, I suppose because we dealt at least some of the time with advertising. Part of my job involved poring over scripts for our clients' TV and radio ads, making sure they didn't violate Federal Communications Commission standards. I would later be awarded the honor of looking after the legal concerns of Barney the Dinosaur. (Yes, this is what passes for freewheeling in a law firm.)</div>

<div class="line_en">If I had to spend seventy hours a week somewhere, my office was a pleasant enough place. I had a leather chair, a buffed walnut desk, and wide windows with a southeastern view. I could look out over the hodgepodge of the business district and see the white-capped waves of Lake Michigan, which in summertime were dotted with bright sailboats. If I angled myself a certain way, I could trace the coastline and glimpse a narrow seam of the South Side with its low-rise rooftops and intermittent stands of trees. From where I sat, the neighborhoods appeared placid and almost toylike, but the reality was in many cases far different. Parts of the South Side had become desolate as businesses shut down and families continued to move out. The steel mills that had once provided stability were cutting thousands of jobs. The crack epidemic, which had ravaged African American communities in places like Detroit and New York, was only just reaching Chicago, but its course was no less destructive. Gangs battled for market share, recruiting young boys to run their street-corner operations, which, while dangerous, was far more lucrative than going to school. The city's murder rate was starting to tick upward -- a sign of even more trouble to come.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果我要在一个地方度过一周中的七十个小时，那我的办公室是相当不错的地方。我有一把皮椅、一张光亮的胡桃木办公桌，还有面朝东南方的大窗户。透过窗户，我的视线可以越过繁忙的商业区，看到密歇根湖上翻腾的白色浪花，夏天的湖面上会有颜色鲜艳的帆船点缀。如果找对角度，我的目光就能沿着海岸线，看到南城的一抹风景。那里房子普遍较矮，树也不多。从我的办公室看过去，那里的住宅区很平静，几乎像玩具一样，但现实情况有很大不同。南城的部分地区已经荒废，店铺倒闭，人们陆续搬走了。曾经提供稳定工作的钢铁厂，解雇了几千人。毒品泛滥的情况在芝加哥初露端倪，并已经对底特律和纽约等地的黑人社区造成严重破坏，在芝加哥的破坏力也丝毫不差。帮派之间为抢夺市场份额互相争斗，他们招募年轻男孩管理街角的生意。对那些男孩来说，这虽然危险，但远比上学要有利可图。芝加哥的谋杀率开始呈上升趋势，那预示着更多的麻烦即将到来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The problem for me was that as a junior associate my work didn't involve much actual interaction with clients and I was a Robinson, raised in the boisterous scrum of my extended family, molded by my father's instinctive love of a crowd. I craved interaction of any sort. To offset the solitude, I joked around with Lorraine, my assistant, a hyperorganized, good-humored African American woman several years my senior who sat just outside my office and answered my phone. I had friendly professional relationships with some of the senior partners and perked up at any chance I had to chitchat with my fellow associates, but in general everyone was overloaded with work and careful not to waste one billable minute of the day. Which put me back at my desk, alone with my documents.</div>

<div class="line_en">I made good money at Sidley but was pragmatic enough to take a bird in the hand when it came to housing. Since finishing law school, I'd been living back in my old South Shore neighborhood, which was still relatively untouched by gangs and drugs. My parents had moved downstairs into Robbie and Terry's old space, and at their invitation I'd taken over the upstairs apartment, where we'd lived when I was a kid, sprucing it up with a crisp white couch and framed batik prints on the walls. I wrote my parents an occasional check that loosely covered my share of the utilities. It hardly counted as paying rent, but they insisted it was plenty. Though my apartment had a private entrance, I most often tromped through the downstairs kitchen as I came and went from work -- in part because my parents' back door opened directly to the garage and in part because I was still and always would be a Robinson. Even if I now fancied myself the sort of suit-wearing, Saab-driving independent young professional I'd always dreamed of being, I didn't much like being alone. I fortified myself with daily check-ins with my mom and dad. I'd hugged them that very morning, in fact, before dashing out the door and driving through a heavy rainstorm to get to work. To get to work, I might add, on time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我在盛德的薪水很高，但在住的方面我比较实际，有现成的就住现成的。从法学院毕业后，我就住回了南岸社区的老房子，那里基本还未受到帮派和毒品的影响。我的父母搬到了楼下萝比和特里的房间，在他们的邀请下，我住到了楼上，那是从我小时候起我们一家人住的地方。我买了一张雪白的沙发，还买了几幅蜡染画挂在墙上，把房间装饰了一下。我偶尔给父母写张支票，基本上会覆盖我那部分水电费。那并不算是房租，但父母总是说足够了。虽然我的公寓有单独的入口，但我上下班时总是从楼下的厨房穿行，一来是因为我父母公寓的后门直接通往车库，比较方便；二来是我依然并永远都是罗宾逊家的人。即使我自认为已经是自己梦想中穿职业套装、开萨博车的年轻而独立的职业女性，但我依然不喜欢自己一个人的日子。我每天都跟父母报到。那一天的早上，我在出门前还拥抱了他们。外面下着暴雨，我冒雨开车赶去上班。这里也许应该加一句：我是按时到的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Barack Obama had already created a stir at the firm. For one thing, he'd just finished his first year of law school, and normally we only hired second-year students for summer positions. But rumor had it he was exceptional. Word had spread that one of his professors at Harvard -- the daughter of a managing partner -- claimed he was the most gifted law student she'd ever encountered. Some of the secretaries who'd seen the guy come in for his interview were saying that on top of this apparent brilliance he was also cute.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="贝拉克·奥巴马已经在事务所引起了轰动。首先，他刚刚完成法学院一年级的学业，而我们暑期实习生的职位一般只招二年级的学生。据传他非常优秀。他在哈佛的一位教授，也是事务所一位执行合伙人的女儿，说贝拉克·奥巴马是她遇到过的最有才华的法学院学生。一些在他过来面试时见过他的秘书说，除了显而易见的优秀之外，他长得还很帅。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I was skeptical of all of it. In my experience, you put a suit on any half-intelligent black man and white people tended to go bonkers. I was doubtful he'd earned the hype. I'd checked out his photo in the summer edition of our staff directory -- a less-than-flattering, poorly lit head shot of a guy with a big smile and a whiff of geekiness -- and remained unmoved. His bio said he was originally from Hawaii, which at least made him a comparatively exotic geek. Otherwise, nothing stood out. The only surprise had come weeks earlier when I made a quick obligatory phone call to introduce myself. I'd been pleasantly startled by the voice on the other end of the line -- a rich, even sexy, baritone that didn't seem to match his photo one bit.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我对这些说法都持怀疑态度。根据我的经验，你随便给一个头脑不笨的黑人套上西装，白人都会疯掉。我怀疑他名不副实。我在暑期的员工名录里看过他的大头照，长相看起来一般，拍摄光线也不好，笑得倒挺开心，好像有点呆头呆脑，反正照片没有改变我对他的印象。他的简历显示，他的老家是夏威夷，所以他至少是个有异域情调的“呆瓜”，除此之外，没什么特点。唯一的意外是，在他报到前几周，我循例打电话给他作自我介绍。电话那头传来一个浑厚甚至还有点性感的男中音，跟他的照片一点儿也对不上，让我有点惊喜。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Later that day, I took Barack to lunch at the fancy restaurant on the first floor of our office building, a place packed with well-groomed bankers and lawyers power lunching over meals priced like dinners. This was the boon of having a summer associate to advise: It was an excuse to eat out and eat well, and to do it on the firm's expense account. As Barack's adviser, I was meant to act as a social conduit more than anything. My assignment was to make sure he was happy in the job, that he had someone to come to if he needed advice, and that he felt connected to the larger team. It was the start of a larger wooing process -- the idea being, as it was with all summer associates, that the firm might want to recruit him for a full-time job once he had his law degree.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天晚些时候，我带贝拉克去我们写字楼一层的一家高档餐厅吃午饭。在那里吃饭的都是穿着得体的银行家和律师，午餐的价格堪比晚餐。那是带暑期实习生的一个福利—可以到外面吃大餐，由事务所来买单。作为贝拉克的督导，我最重要的角色是充当社交媒介。我要确保他上班时心情愉快，在必要时为他提供建议，让他在我们团队有归属感。这是一个更大的招揽计划的开端，跟所有暑期实习生一样，在他拿到法学院学位后，事务所可能会招他进来做全职工作。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was another ten minutes before he checked in at the reception area on our floor and I walked out to meet him, finding him seated on a couch -- one Barack Obama, dressed in a dark suit and still a little damp from the rain. He grinned sheepishly and apologized for his lateness as he shook my hand. He had a wide smile and was taller and thinner than I'd imagined he'd be -- a man who was clearly not much of an eater, who also looked fully unaccustomed to wearing business clothes. If he knew he was arriving with a whiz-kid reputation, it didn't show. As I walked him through the corridors to my office, introducing him to the cushy mundanities of corporate law -- showing him the word-processing center and the coffee machine, explaining our system for tracking billable hours -- he was quiet and deferential, listening attentively. After about twenty minutes, I delivered him to the senior partner who'd be his actual supervisor for the summer and went back to my desk.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="时间又过去了十分钟，他才到达我所在楼层的前台。我走出去见他，他正坐在沙发上。那就是贝拉克·奥巴马，他穿着一身深色西装，因为淋了雨身上还有点湿。他不好意思地咧嘴一笑，一面跟我握手，一面为自己的迟到道歉。他的笑容很灿烂，人比我想象中要高和瘦。这个人明显吃得不多，而且看起来很不习惯穿正装。就算他知道自己是顶着天才的名声过来的，他也没有表现出来。我带着他穿过走廊来到我的办公室，向他介绍事务所的情况，告诉他文字处理中心和咖啡机的位置，解释我们是如何计算工作时间的，他安静而谦恭，认真地听着。大约二十分钟后，我把他带到高级合伙人那里，那是他暑期实习期间真正的导师，然后我回到了自己的办公室。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Very quickly, I realized that Barack would need little in the way of advice. He was three years older than I was -- about to turn twenty-eight. Unlike me, he'd worked for several years after finishing his undergrad degree at Columbia before moving on to law school. What struck me was how assured he seemed of his own direction in life. He was oddly free from doubt, though at first glance it was hard to understand why. Compared with my own lockstep march toward success, the direct arrow shot of my trajectory from Princeton to Harvard to my desk on the forty-seventh floor, Barack's path was an improvisational zigzag through disparate worlds. I learned over lunch that he was in every sense a hybrid -- the son of a black Kenyan father and a white mother from Kansas whose marriage had been both youthful and short-lived. He'd been born and raised in Honolulu but had spent four years of his childhood flying kites and catching crickets in Indonesia. After high school, he'd passed two relatively laid-back years as a student at Occidental College in Los Angeles before transferring to Columbia, where by his own account he'd behaved nothing like a college boy set loose in 1980s Manhattan and instead lived like a sixteenth-century mountain hermit, reading lofty works of literature and philosophy in a grimy apartment on 109th Street, writing bad poetry, and fasting on Sundays.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="很快，我意识到贝拉克几乎不需要什么建议。他比我大三岁，快要满二十八岁了。和我不同的是，他在哥伦比亚大学本科毕业后工作了几年，然后才考取的法学院。在我看来，他对自己的人生方向非常笃定。他没有什么怀疑，这让人觉得很奇怪，初看起来也难以理解。我是一环扣一环地走向成功的，从普林斯顿到哈佛再到四十七层的办公室，是一条像箭头一样笔直的轨道；贝拉克的人生道路则是在截然不同的世界中即兴穿梭的过程。在午饭聊天中，我了解到他从各个方面来讲都是“杂糅”的：他的父亲是来自肯尼亚的黑人，母亲是来自堪萨斯州的白人，他们年轻时有过一段短暂的婚姻；他在火奴鲁鲁出生和成长，又在印度尼西亚生活了四年，在那里放风筝、捉蛐蛐；高中毕业后，他先在洛杉矶的西方学院优哉游哉地读了两年，后来转学到哥伦比亚。根据他的说法，他过得不像一个被放飞在20世纪80年代的曼哈顿的大学男生，而像一个生活在16世纪的山中隐士，住在109街的一间脏兮兮的公寓里，啃大部头的文学和哲学著作，写一些糟糕的诗歌，每个星期日还会斋戒。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Barack was the first person I'd met at Sidley who had spent time in the barbershops, barbecue joints, and Bible-thumping black parishes of the Far South Side. Before going to law school, he'd worked in Chicago for three years as a community organizer, earning $12,000 a year from a nonprofit that bound together a coalition of churches. His task was to help rebuild neighborhoods and bring back jobs. As he described it, it had been two parts frustration to one part reward: He'd spend weeks planning a community meeting, only to have a dozen people show up. His efforts were scoffed at by union leaders and picked apart by black folks and white folks alike. Yet over time, he'd won a few incremental victories, and this seemed to encourage him. He was in law school, he explained, because grassroots organizing had shown him that meaningful societal change required not just the work of the people on the ground but stronger policies and governmental action as well.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="贝拉克是我在盛德遇到的第一个会去理发店、烧烤摊和南城远郊宣讲福音的人。在上法学院之前，他受雇于一家非营利组织，那是几个教堂的联合体。他作为社区组织者在芝加哥工作了三年，年薪12000美元。他的工作就是帮助重建社区，创造就业机会。根据他的描述，那份工作有两大挫折和一大回报。他曾经花了几周时间筹备一个社区会议，最后只有十几个人到会。他的努力受到工会领导者的嘲笑，白人和黑人都来挑他的毛病。但是做了一段时间后，他赢得胜利的次数在增加，这让他倍受鼓舞。他之所以去上法学院，是因为在基层的工作经历让他看到，重大的社会变革不只需要基层人员的工作，还需要更强大的政策和政府的行动。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We laughed about all of it, swapping stories about our backgrounds and what led us to the law. Barack was serious without being self-serious.

<div class="line_en">Despite my resistance to the hype that had preceded him, I found myself admiring Barack for both his self-assuredness and his earnest demeanor. He was refreshing, unconventional, and weirdly elegant. Not once, though, did I think about him as someone I'd want to date. For one thing, I was his mentor at the firm. I'd also recently sworn off dating altogether, too consumed with work to put any effort into it. And finally, appallingly, at the end of lunch Barack lit a cigarette, which would have been enough to snuff any interest, if I'd had any to begin with.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尽管我之前对关于他的传言是抵触的，但我发现自己也开始崇拜贝拉克了，崇拜他的自信还有认真。他让人觉得耳目一新、不落窠臼，还有点儿不寻常的优雅。但是，我从来没有把他看作约会对象。首先，我在事务所是他的督导。我随后也下决心不去想约会的事，因为工作太忙实在没有多余的精力。另外，那天吃完午饭后，贝拉克点了一支香烟，这让我大吃一惊，也足以熄灭我对他的任何兴趣—假如说我开始对他有一点儿兴趣的话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Over the next couple of weeks, we fell into a kind of routine. In the late afternoon, Barack would wander down the hall and flop onto one of the chairs in my office, as if he'd known me for years. Sometimes it felt as if he had. Our banter was easy, our mind-sets alike. We gave each other sideways glances when people around us got stressed to the point of mania, when partners made comments that seemed condescending or out of touch. What was unspoken but obvious was that he was a brother, and in our office, which employed more than four hundred lawyers, only about five full-time attorneys were African American. Our pull toward each other was evident and easy to understand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在接下去的几周里，我们逐渐形成了规律。下午晚些时候，贝拉克会走过大厅，在我办公室的一把椅子上坐下来，好像已经认识我好几年似的。有时感觉确实如此。我们会很轻松地开玩笑，我们的思维模式很相像。当周围的人工作压力大到像得了狂躁症，当事务所合伙人做出一些居高临下或者脱离实际的评论时，我们会交换一下眼神。不言自明的一点是：他是我的同道中人，而且我们事务所雇用了四百多位律师，只有大约五名全职律师是非洲裔美国人，所以我们彼此吸引是理所当然且容易理解的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Barack bore no resemblance to the typical eager-beaver summer associate (as I myself had been two years earlier at Sidley), networking furiously and anxiously wondering whether a golden-ticket job offer was coming. He sauntered around with calm detachment, which seemed only to increase his appeal. Inside the firm, his reputation was continuing to grow. Already, he was being asked to sit in on high-level partner meetings. Already, he was being pressed to give input on whatever issues were under discussion. At some point early in the summer, he pumped out a thirty-page memo about corporate governance that was evidently so thorough and cogent it became instantly legendary. Who was this guy? Everyone seemed intrigued.</div>

<div class="line_en">Did he know I'd never read it? I think he probably did. He'd given it to me half as a joke. We were in different specialty groups, so there was no material overlap in our work anyway. I had plenty of my own documents to contend with. And I didn't need to be wowed. We were friends now, Barack and I, comrades in arms. We ate lunch out at least once a week and sometimes more often than that, always, of course, billing Sidley &amp; Austin for the pleasure. Gradually, we learned more about each other. He knew that I lived in the same house as my parents, that my happiest memories of Harvard Law School stemmed from the work I'd done in the Legal Aid Bureau.

I knew that his father had died in a car crash in Kenya and that he'd made a trip there to try to understand more about the man.

<div class="line_en">This last bit was something I thought I could rectify. My life in Chicago was nothing if not crowded with accomplished and eligible black women. My marathon work hours notwithstanding, I liked to socialize. I had friends from Sidley, friends from high school, friends developed through professional networking, and friends I'd met through Craig, who was newly married and making his living as an investment banker in town. We were a merry co-ed crew, congregating when we could in one downtown bar or another and catching up over long, lavish meals on weekends. I'd gone out with a couple of guys in law school but hadn't met anyone special upon returning to Chicago and had little interest anyway. I'd announced to everyone, including potential suitors, that my career was my priority. I did, though, have plenty of girlfriends who were looking for someone to date.</div>

<div class="line_en">There was a time, he told me, when he'd been looser, more wild. He'd spent the first twenty years of his life going by the nickname Barry. As a teen, he smoked pot in the lush volcanic foothills of Oahu. At Occidental, he rode the waning energy of the 1970s, embracing Hendrix and the Stones. Somewhere along the way, though, he'd stepped into the fullness of his birth name -- Barack Hussein Obama -- and the complicated rubric of his identity. He was white and black, African and American. He was modest and lived modestly, yet knew the richness of his own mind and the world of privilege that would open up to him as a result. He took it all seriously, I could tell. He could be lighthearted and jokey, but he never strayed far from a larger sense of obligation. He was on some sort of quest, though he didn't yet know where it would lead. All I knew was that it didn't translate over drinks. Next time happy hour rolled around, I left him at the office.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他告诉我，他自己也曾经比现在更散漫不羁的时光。他人生的头二十年，对外用的名字都是他的昵称贝里。十几岁的时候，他在瓦胡岛草木茂盛的火山山麓吸大麻。在西方学院时，身处20世纪70年代颓废的社会风气中，他的偶像是亨德里克斯 [3]和滚石乐队。后来，他用回了自己的全名—贝拉克·侯赛因·奥巴马，并接受了自己复杂的身份。他是白人和黑人、非洲人和美国人的混血儿。他为人谦逊，生活简朴，但他知道自己丰富的头脑会让特权世界向他敞开大门。我能看出来，他在严肃地对待这一切。他看起来轻松愉快、爱开玩笑，但从未远离一种更强的责任感。他正踏上某种征途，虽然还不知道会通向何方。我只知道喝酒对他的未来没什么帮助。再一次去酒吧欢聚的时候，我让他留在了办公室。【注：[3]吉米·亨德里克斯（James Marshall “Jimi” Hendrix，1942—1970），出生于美国华盛顿州西雅图，美国吉他手、歌手、作曲人，被公认为摇滚音乐史中最伟大的电吉他演奏者。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Barack was cerebral, probably too cerebral for most people to put up with. (This, in fact, would be my friend's assessment of him when we next spoke.) He wasn't a happy-hour guy, and maybe I should have realized that earlier. My world was filled with hopeful, hardworking people who were obsessed with their own upward mobility. They had new cars and were buying their first condos and liked to talk about it all over martinis after work. Barack was more content to spend an evening alone, reading up on urban housing policy. As an organizer, he'd spent weeks and months listening to poor people describe their challenges. His insistence on hope and the potential for mobility, I was coming to see, came from an entirely different and not easily accessible place.</div>

When Craig and I were very young, we pulled a brand-new carton of Newports from a shelf and set about destroying them, snapping them like beans over the kitchen sink. Another time, we dipped the ends of their cigarettes in hot sauce and returned them to the pack. We lectured our parents about lung cancer, explaining the horrors that had been shown to us on filmstrips during health class at school -- images of smokers' lungs, desiccated and black as charcoal, death in the making, death right inside your chest. For contrast, we'd been shown pictures of florid pink lungs that were healthy, uncontaminated by smoke. The paradigm was simple enough to make their behavior confounding: Good/Bad. Healthy/Sick. You choose your own future. It was everything our parents had ever taught us. And yet it would be years before they finally quit.</div>

<div class="line_en">We walked through the party not quite like a couple but still mostly together, drifting between clusters of colleagues, drinking beer and lemonade, eating hamburgers and potato salad from plastic plates. We'd get separated and then find each other again. It all felt natural. He was quietly flirty with me and I was flirty back. Some of the men started playing pickup basketball, and I watched as Barack moseyed on over to the court in his flip-flops to join. He had an easy rapport with everyone at the firm. He addressed all the secretaries by name and got along with everyone -- from the older, stuffier lawyers to the ambitious young bucks who were now playing basketball. He's a good person, I thought to myself, watching him pass the ball to another lawyer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们在派对上不太像一对，但是大多数时间都在一起，在同事堆里穿梭，喝啤酒和柠檬汁，吃塑料盘子里的汉堡和土豆沙拉。我们不时会分开，然后再找到对方。一切都感觉很自然。他会含蓄地和我调情，我也会回应他。一些男同事临时组队打起了篮球，我看到贝拉克穿着人字拖鞋溜达到球场加入比赛。他和事务所的所有人都相处得轻松融洽。他能叫出所有秘书的名字，跟每个人都合得来，包括正在打篮球的那些人—从年长的古板而保守的律师到雄心勃勃的年轻小伙子。“他人挺好。”看着他把球传给另一位律师，我心里想。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A day or two later, Barack asked if I could give him a ride to a barbecue for summer associates, which was happening that weekend at a senior partner's home in one of the wealthy lakefront suburbs north of the city. The weather, as I remember it, was clear that day, the lake sparkling at the edge of a well-tended lawn. A caterer served food as music blared over stereo speakers and people remarked on the tasteful grandeur of the house. The whole milieu was a portrait of affluence and ease, a less-than-subtle reminder of the payoff that came when you committed yourself wholeheartedly to the grind. Barack, I knew, wrestled with what he wanted to do with his life, which direction his career would take. He had an uneasy relationship with wealth. Like me, he'd never had it, and he didn't aspire to it, either. He wanted to be effective far more than he wanted to be rich but was still trying to figure out how.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一两天后，贝拉克问我是否可以在周末开车带他去一个为暑期实习生举办的烧烤派对，地点在一位高级合伙人的家里，位于市区北边一个富裕的湖滨郊区。我记得那天风和日丽，在一块悉心打理的草坪尽头，湖面泛着粼粼波光。负责餐饮的人端上了食物，音响里高声播放着音乐，人们对主人豪宅的品位交口称赞。整个环境就是一幅富足而安逸的画面，也很明显地提醒着你，全身心投入枯燥乏味的工作会带来怎样的回报。我知道，贝拉克一直在纠结自己未来要做什么，要选择什么样的职业方向。他对财富有一种不安。和我一样，他从未拥有过很多财富，也并不渴望财富。他希望人生过得有价值胜过希望挣很多钱，但是他仍然在想怎样去实现这种价值。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Having sat through scores of high school and college games, I recognized a good player when I saw one, and Barack quickly passed the test. He played an athletic, artful form of basketball, his lanky body moving quickly, showing power I hadn't before noticed. He was swift and graceful, even in his Hawaiian footwear. I stood there pretending to listen to what somebody's perfectly nice wife was saying to me, but my eyes stayed fixed on Barack. I was struck for the first time by the spectacle of him -- this strange mix-of-everything man.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我从高中到大学看过很多场球赛，很容易就能看出一个人打球的水平，贝拉克很快通过了测试。他打篮球时身手矫健，很有艺术感，瘦长的身体移动迅速，展示出我之前未曾注意到的力量。即使穿着夏威夷式的鞋子，他的行动依然迅捷优雅。我站在那里假装听某位同事态度友好的妻子跟我说话，但是眼睛一直盯着贝拉克。我的内心第一次被他—这个奇怪的混合了各种元素的男人—打动。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As we drove back to the city in the early evening, I felt a new ache, some freshly planted seed of longing. It was July. Barack would be leaving sometime in August, disappearing into law school and whatever else life held for him there. Nothing had changed outwardly -- we were kidding around, as we always did, gossiping about who'd said what at the barbecue -- but there was a certain kind of heat climbing my spine. I was acutely aware of his body in the small space of my car -- his elbow resting on the console, his knee within reach of my hand. As we followed the southward curve of Lake Shore Drive, passing bicyclists and runners on the pedestrian pathways, I was arguing silently with myself. Was there a way to do this unseriously? How badly could it hurt my job? I had no clarity about anything -- about what was proper, about who would find out and whether that mattered -- but it hit me that I was done waiting for clarity.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="傍晚，在我们开车回市区的路上，我内心感到一种新的疼痛，那是某个新播下的渴望的种子。当时是7月，贝拉克8月就要走了，回到法学院和那里的生活中去。从表面看什么都没有改变—我们像往常一样开着玩笑，八卦着谁在烧烤派对上说了什么话，但是一股热流爬上了我的脊背。在我车里的狭小空间里，我强烈地感受到他身体的存在—他的手肘支在控制台上，他的膝盖在我触手可及的地方。当我们沿着湖滨大道开始向南行驶，经过两旁人行道上骑自行车和跑步的人时，我在心里默默地和自己进行斗争。是不是可以不那么严肃地试着交往一下？这会在多大程度上影响我的工作？我对所有事都没把握—怎么做才合适？谁会发现？会有什么影响？但是我突然觉得，我不想再等到什么都有把握了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This is when I knew the game was on, one of the few times I decided to stop thinking and just live. It was a warm summer evening in the city that I loved. The air felt soft on my skin. There was a Baskin-Robbins on the block near Barack's apartment, and we got ourselves two cones, taking them outside to eat, finding ourselves a spot on the curb. We sat close together with our knees pulled up, pleasantly tired after a day spent outdoors, eating our ice cream quickly and wordlessly, trying to stay ahead of the melt. Maybe Barack read it on my face or sensed it in my posture -- the fact that everything for me had now begun to loosen and unfold.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那个时候，我知道游戏开始了，那是我人生中少有的几次决定停止思考、活在当下的时刻。那是一个温暖的夏夜，在我热爱的城市里，空气触着皮肤感觉很柔和。在贝拉克公寓旁边的街区有一家芭斯罗缤冰激凌店 [5]，我们要了两个甜筒，走出店门，在外面的步行道上找了个位置。我们伸直了膝盖，挨近了坐着，在户外待了一天，疲惫但心情愉快。我们快速地吃着冰激凌，没有说话，担心冰激凌化掉。可能贝拉克从我脸上读到了或者从我的姿势上感觉到了我的内心已经开始松动并向他敞开。【注：[5]芭斯罗缤冰激凌店， 1945年的一天，美国人伯特·巴斯金和欧文·罗宾斯在加利福尼亚的洛杉矶合伙开的一家冰激凌店，他们的天才创造让美国顾客流连忘返。其中最吸引人的新概念是“每月31天，每天一个口味”。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was living in Hyde Park, subletting an apartment from a friend. By the time we pulled into the neighborhood, the tension lay thick in the air between us, like something inevitable or predestined was finally about to happen. Or was I imagining it? Maybe I'd shut him down too many times. Maybe he'd given up and now just saw me as a good, stalwart friend -- a girl with an air-conditioned Saab who'd drive him around when he needed it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他住在海德公园，是从一位朋友那里分租了一套公寓。车子驶进社区的时候，我们之间的空气里充满了紧张感，好像某件不可避免、命中注定的事情就要发生。或者那只是我的想象？可能我拒绝了他太多次。可能他已经放弃，现在只是把我看成一个不错的、可靠的朋友—一个在他有需要时可以开着有冷气的萨博车送他的女孩。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I halted the car in front of his building, my mind still in blurry overdrive. We let an awkward beat pass, each waiting for the other to initiate a good-bye. Barack cocked his head at me.</div>
