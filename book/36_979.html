<div class="line_en">Installed in her comfortable room, Carrie wondered how Hurstwood had taken her departure. She arranged a few things hastily and then left for the theatre, half expecting to encounter him at the door. Not finding him, her dread lifted, and she felt more kindly toward him. She quite forgot him until about to come out, after the show, when the chance of his being there frightened her. As day after day passed and she heard nothing at all, the thought of being bothered by him passed.</div>

<div class="line_en">It is curious to note how quickly a profession absorbs one. Carrie became wise in theatrical lore, hearing the gossip of little Lola. She learned what the theatrical papers were, which ones published items about actresses and the like. She began to read the newspaper notices, not only of the opera in which she had so small a part, but of others. Gradually the desire for notice took hold of her. She longed to be renowned like others, and read with avidity all the complimentary or critical comments made concerning others high in her profession. The showy world in which her interest lay completely absorbed her.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Sunday before taking her new part she scanned the theatrical pages for some little notice. It would have accorded with her expectations if nothing had been said, but there in the squibs, tailing off several more substantial items, was a wee notice. Carrie read it with a tingling body: "The part of Katisha, the country maid, in 'The Wives of Abdul' at the Broadway, heretofore played by Inez Carew, will be hereafter filled by Carrie Madenda, one of the cleverest members of the chorus."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在她出演新角色之前的那个星期天，她浏览了报纸上的戏剧版，想看看会不会有什么短的介绍。倘若报上只字不提，也是在她的意料之中的，但是在那些小新闻中，接在几则较为重要的新闻之后，还真有一段很短的介绍。嘉莉看的时候，全身都激动起来。“正在百老汇戏院上演的《阿布都尔的后妃》一剧中的乡下姑娘卡蒂莎一角，原由伊内兹·卡鲁扮演，今后将由群舞队中最伶俐的队员嘉莉·麦登达担任。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was about this time that the newspapers and magazines were beginning to pay that illustrative attention to the beauties of the stage which has since become fervid. The newspapers, and particularly the Sunday newspapers, indulged in large decorative theatrical pages, in which the faces and forms of well-known theatrical celebrities appeared, enclosed with artistic scrolls. The magazines also or at least one or two of the newer ones -- published occasional portraits of pretty stars, and now and again photos of scenes from various plays. Carrie watched these with growing interest. When would a scene from her opera appear? When would some paper think her photo worth while?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="差不多也就在这个时候，报纸和杂志开始将舞台上的美人的照片用作插图，而且此后这种作法形成了热潮。装饰性很强的带有插图的大幅戏剧版面充斥了各种报纸，特别是星期日版报纸，这些版面上刊登出戏剧界大名角儿的半身和全身照片，照片四周还饰有艺术花边。杂志——或者至少是一两种较新的杂志——也偶尔刊登漂亮名角儿的照片，时而还刊登各剧的剧照。嘉莉看着这些，兴趣越来越大。什么时候会登出一幅她正在演的那出歌剧的剧照呢？什么时候会有份报纸认为她的照片值得一登呢？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The first week she got her thirty-five dollars, it seemed an enormous sum. Paying only three dollars for room rent seemed ridiculous. After giving Lola her twenty-five, she still had seven dollars left. With four left over from previous earnings, she had eleven. Five of this went to pay the regular installment on the clothes she had to buy. The next week she was even in greater feather. Now, only three dollars need be paid for room rent and five on her clothes. The rest she had for food and her own whims.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她第一个星期拿到她那35块钱的时候，觉得这是一个巨大的数目。付房租只要花3块钱。说起来似乎很可笑。把借萝拉的那25块钱还掉之后，她还剩下7块钱。加上以前余下的4块钱，她已经有了11块钱。其中的5块钱被用来付她非买不可的行头的分期付款。第二个星期她更加情绪高涨。现在只要付3块钱的房租和5块钱的行头。剩下的钱她用来吃饭和买一些自己喜欢的东西。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The regular entrance of thirty-five dollars a week to one who has endured scant allowances for several years is a demoralising thing. Carrie found her purse bursting with good green bills of comfortable denominations. Having no one dependent upon her, she began to buy pretty clothes and pleasing trinkets, to eat well, and to ornament her room. Friends were not long in gathering about. She met a few young men who belonged to Lola's staff. The members of the opera company made her acquaintance without the formality of introduction. One of these discovered a fancy for her. On several occasions he strolled home with her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="每星期35块钱的固定收入，对一个几年来一直忍受着靠几个零花钱过日子的人，是会产生消极影响的。嘉莉发现自己的钱包里装满了面值可观的绿色钞票。没有人要靠她养活，因此她开始购买漂亮的衣服和可爱的小玩意儿，开始吃好的，并装饰自己的房间，不久她的身边就聚集了一些朋友。她和萝拉的那伙人中的几个青年见了面。剧团的男演员也未经正式介绍就结识了她。其中的一个还迷上了她。有几次他陪她走回家。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In April she learned that the opera would probably last until the middle or the end of May, according to the size of the audiences. Next season it would go on the road. She wondered if she would be with it. As usual, Miss Osborne, owing to her moderate salary, was for securing a home engagement.</div>

<div class="line_en">The metropolis is a cold place socially, and Carrie soon found that a little money brought her nothing. The world of wealth and distinction was quite as far away as ever.

<div class="line_en">On the opening night it looked to Carrie as if there were nothing to her part, after all. The happy, sweltering audience did not seem to see her in the first act. She frowned and frowned, but to no effect. Eyes were riveted upon the more elaborate efforts of the stars.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="开演的那天晚上，嘉莉觉得似乎自己演的角色终究还是无足轻重。那些快乐、狂热的观众在第一幕里好像都没有看见她。她把眉头皱了又皱。但是什么效果也没有。观众的目光都集中在那些主角们的精心表演上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Carrie instantly brightened up, thinking he had meant it as a rebuke.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the second act, the crowd, wearied by a dull conversation, roved with its eyes about the stage and sighted her. There she was, grey-suited, sweet-faced, demure, but scowling. At first the general idea was that she was temporarily irritated, that the look was genuine and not fun at all. As she went on frowning, looking now at one principal and now at the other, the audience began to smile. The portly gentlemen in the front rows began to feel that she was a delicious little morsel. It was the kind of frown they would have loved to force away with kisses. All the gentlemen yearned toward her. She was capital.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在第二幕里，观众们因为听厌了一段枯燥无味的对白，目光开始在舞台上扫来扫去，于是就看见了她。她就在那里，穿着灰色的衣服，漂亮的脸上显得严肃而忧郁。起初，大家都以为她是一时不高兴，表情是真的，一点也不觉得可笑。但她一直皱着眉头，时而看看这个主角，时而又看看那个主角。这时，观众开始发笑了。前排的那些大腹便便的绅士们开始觉得她是一个可人的小东西。她的那种皱眉正是他们乐于用亲吻来抚平的。所有的男人都向往着她。她演得真是棒极了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Miss Madenda presents one of the most delightful bits of character work ever seen on the Casino stage," observed the stage critic of the "Sun." "It is a bit of quiet, unassuming drollery which warms like good wine. Evidently the part was not intended to take precedence, as Miss Madenda is not often on the stage, but the audience, with the characteristic perversity of such bodies, selected for itself. The little Quakeress was marked for a favourite the moment she appeared, and thereafter easily held attention and applause. The vagaries of fortune are indeed curious."</div>
