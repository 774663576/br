<div class="line_en">My soi-disant passionate and lonely Charlotte was in everyday life matter-of-fact and gregarious. Moreover, I discovered that although she could not control her heart or her cries, she was a woman of principle. Immediately after she had become more or less my mistress (despite the stimulants, her "nervous, eager chéri"-- a heroic chéri!-- had some initial trouble, for which, however, he amply compensated her by a fantastic display of old-world endearments), good Charlotte interviewed me about my relations with God. I could have answered that on that score my mind was open; I said, instead -- paying my tribute to a pious platitude -- that I believed in a cosmic spirit. Looking down at her fingernails, she also asked me had I not in my family a certain strange strain.</div>

<div class="line_en">When the bride is a widow and the groom is a widower; when the former has lived in Our Great Little Town for hardly two years, and the latter for hardly a month; when Monsieur wants to get the whole damned thing over with as quickly as possible, and Madame gives in with a tolerant smile; then, my reader, the wedding is generally a "quiet" affair. The bride may dispense with a tiara of orange blossoms securing her finger-tip veil, nor does she carry a white orchid in a prayer book. The bride's little daughter might have added to the ceremonies uniting H. and H. a touch of vivid vermeil; but I knew I would not dare be too tender with cornered Lolita yet, and therefore agreed it was not worth while tearing the child away from her beloved Camp Q.</div>

<div class="line_en">Oh, she was very genteel: she said "excuse me" whenever a slight burp interrupted her flowing speech, called an envelope an ahnvelope, and when talking to her lady-friends referred to me as Mr. Humbert. I thought it would please her if I entered the community trailing some glamor after me. On the day of our wedding a little interview with me appeared in the Society Column of the Ramsdale Journal, with a photograph of Charlotte, one eyebrow up and a misprint in her name ("Hazer"). Despite this contretemps, the publicity warmed the porcelain cockles of her heart -- and made my rattles shake with awful glee. By engaging in church work as well as by getting to know the better mothers of Lo's schoolmates, Charlotte in the course of twenty months or so had managed to become if not a prominent, at least an acceptable citizen, but never before had she come under that thrilling rubrique, and it was I who put her there, Mr. Edgar H. Humbert (I threw in the "Edgar" just for the heck of it), "writer and explorer." McCoo's brother, when taking it down, asked me what I had written. Whatever I told him came out as "several books on Peacock, Rainbow and other poets." It was also noted that Charlotte and I had known each other for several years and that I was a distant relation of her first husband. I hinted I had had an affair with her thirteen years ago but this was not mentioned in print. To Charlotte I said that society columns should contain a shimmer of errors.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="噢，她确是非常有教养的：每次在她流畅的谈话中稍有停顿，每次把“xin封”读作“xia封”，她都要说“请原谅”；无论何时与她的女友交谈都称我为亨伯特先生。我想如果我拖着一束迷人的光进入公众圈，定会令她欣喜异常。结婚那天，对我的一小段采访在拉姆斯代尔《日报》的“社会栏”上登了出来，还附有夏洛特的玉照，一只眉毛挑起来，名字还拼错了（“黑兹尔”）。尽管有这等尴尬事，这种大出风头还是使她振奋不已———我也因难堪的快乐而摇头晃脑了。夏洛待开始热衷干教会事务，又设法结识了洛的同学比较出色的母亲，近二十个月来，地已经成为—名即使不是卓著的，至少也是值得接受的公民；但在此之前她从未出现在激动人心的专栏中，是我，埃德加，亨·亨伯特先生（我加上埃德加只为了装装样子），“作家兼探险家”，才使她扬名。麦库的兄弟问我曾写过什么。不管我告诉他什么，登出来时都是“几部关于孔雀、彩虹和其他诗人的书”。并且还说明夏洛特和我已相识多年，我是她第一位丈夫的远亲。我暗示十三年前就和她有过私情，但这在发表时未提。我对夏洛特说，社会栏应该具有一些误差。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I countered by inquiring whether she would still want to marry me if my father's maternal grandfather had been, say, a Turk. She said it did not matter a bit; but that, if she ever found out I did not believe in Our Christian God, she would commit suicide. She said it so solemnly that it gave me the creeps.

<div class="line_en">The transformation improved her looks. Her smile that had been such a contrived thing, thenceforth became the radiance of utter adoration -- a radiance having something soft and moist about it, in which, with wonder, I recognized a resemblance to the lovely, inane, lost look that Lo had when gloating over a new kind of concoction at the soda fountain or mutely admiring my expensive, always tailor-fresh clothes. Deeply fascinated, I would watch Charlotte while she swapped parental woes with some other lady and made that national grimace of feminine resignation (eyes rolling up, mouth drooping sideways) which, in an infantile form, I had seen Lo making herself. We had highballs before turning in, and with their help, I would manage to evoke the child while caressing the mother. This was the white stomach within which my nymphet had been a little curved fish in 1934. This carefully dyed hair, so sterile to my sense of smell and touch, acquired at certain lamplit moments in the poster bed the tinge, if not the texture, of Lolita's curls. I kept telling myself, as I wielded my brand-new large-as-life wife, that biologically this was the nearest I could get to Lolita; that at Lolita's age, Lotte had been as desirable a schoolgirl as her daughter was, and as Lolita's daughter would be some day. I had my wife unearth from under a collection of shoes (Mr. Haze had a passion for them, it appears) a thirty-year-old album, so that I might see how Lotte had looked as a child; and even though the light was wrong and the dresses graceless, I was able to make out a dim first version of Lolita's outline, legs, cheekbones, bobbed nose. Lottelita, Lolitchen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这场变化使她的容貌大为改观。她的微笑过去是那么一种做作的东西，现在却变得那么迷人璀灿——璀灿，还附带着什么柔软、温湿的东西，我惊奇地发现它和那副可爱却空虚、迷茫的神情何其相似，那是洛在贪婪地望着新式混和型饮料，或默默无言地羡慕我总是新裁制的昂贵衣服时所有的。我变得狂热了，凝望着夏洛特和其它女士交换作父母的悲哀，凝望她作出那个标志女性之顺从的国家级鬼脸（眼睛转上去，嘴巴斜向一边），这我曾看见洛象婴儿一般作给自己。睡觉前，我们总喝点威士忌或其它烈酒，我依靠它们得以一边抚抱母亲一边回忆那孩子。这是她白皙的腹部，一九三四年我的性感少女曾象条小鱼蜷在里面。这仔细染过的头发，对我的嗅觉和触觉来说都是那么枯涩，但在台灯光照的特定时刻，在脚夫的床上，却获得了如果不是洛丽塔卷发的质地，也是她的色泽。在我支配我白头储老的新妻子时，我不住告诫自己，就我而言，这是能接近洛丽塔的最便利的方法；洛蒂①在洛丽塔的年龄也象她女儿一样是个欲望很多的女学生，而洛丽塔的女儿有一天也会如此。从一本用了三十年的影集里，我在一堆鞋子底下将妻子发掘了出来（黑兹先生看来对鞋子很热衷），这样就可以看看洛蒂小时候长得什么样；即使光线不对，衣饰不美，我还是能模模糊糊看出洛丽塔最初的轮廓、双腿、颧骨、短鼻。洛蒂丽塔，洛丽特申。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Let us go on with this curious tale. When called upon to enjoy my promotion from lodger to lover, did I experience only bitterness and distaste? No. Mr. Humbert confesses to a certain titillation of his vanity, to some faint tenderness, even to a pattern of remorse daintily running along the steel of his conspiratorial dagger. Never had I thought that the rather ridiculous, though rather handsome Mrs. Haze, with her blind faith in the wisdom of her church and book club, her mannerisms of elocution, her harsh, cold, contemptuous attitude toward an adorable, downy-armed child of twelve, could turn into such a touching, helpless creature as soon as I laid my hands upon her which happened on the threshold of Lolita's room whither she tremulously backed repeating "no, no, please no."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="让我们继续这个奇异的故事吧。当我被召去享受从房客向情人的转升时，我是否只体会到痛苦和厌恶呢？不，亨伯特先生承认他的虚荣得到了某种刺激的快感，得到了朦胧的温柔感，甚至有一种懊悔优雅地追随着他的阴谋者匕首的利刃。我从来没料到这位虽然相当漂亮，但由于她对她的教堂和读书俱乐部满怀盲目的信仰，她谈吐的风度，以及她对一个茸毛细密、可爱的十二岁孩子那副苛刻、冷酷又轻蔑的态度而显得相当可笑的亨伯特夫人，竟能变成这样一个动人娇弱的造物，当我在洛丽塔卧室的门口将手放在她的手上时，她战栗地缩了回去，不住地说，“不，不，请别这样。”">查看中文翻译</div>

And when, by means of pitifully ardent, naïvely lascivious caresses, she of the noble nipple and massive thigh prepared me for the performance of my nightly duty, it was still a nymphet's scent that in despair I tried to pick up, as I bayed through the undergrowth of dark decaying forests.</div>

<div class="line_en">At breakfast, in the depressingly bright kitchen, with its chrome glitter and Hardware and Co. Calendar and cute breakfast nook (simulating that Coffee Shoppe where in their college days Charlotte and Humbert used to coo together), she would sit, robed in red, her elbow on the plastic-topped table, her cheek propped on her fist, and stare at me with intolerable tenderness as I consumed my ham and eggs. Humbert's face might twitch with neuralgia, but in her eyes it vied in beauty and animation with the sun and shadows of leaves rippling on the white refrigerator. My solemn exasperation was to her the silence of love. My small income added to her even smaller one impressed her as a brilliant fortune; not because the resulting sum now sufficed for most middle-class needs, but because even my money shone in her eyes with the magic of my manliness, and she saw our joint account as one of those southern boulevards at midday that have solid shade on one side and smooth sunshine on the other, all the way to the end of a prospect, where pink mountains loom.</div>

<div class="line_en">Into the fifty days of our cohabitation Charlotte crammed the activities of as many years. The poor woman busied herself with a number of things she had foregone long before or had never been much interested in, as if (to prolong these Proustian intonations) by my marrying the mother of the child I loved I had enabled my wife to regain an abundance of youth by proxy. With the zest of a banal young bride, she started to "glorify the home." Knowing as I did its every cranny by heart -- since those days when from my chair I mentally mapped out Lolita's course through the house -- I had long entered into a sort of emotional relationship with it, with its very ugliness and dirt, and now I could almost feel the wretched thing cower in its reluctance to endure the bath of ecru and ocher and putty-buff-and-snuff that Charlotte planned to give it. She never got as far as that, thank God, but she did use up a tremendous amount of energy in washing window shades, waxing the slats of Venetian blinds, purchasing new shades and new blinds, returning them to the store, replacing them by others, and so on, in a constant chiaroscuro of smiles and frowns, doubts and pouts. She dabbled in cretonnes and chintzes; she changed the colors of the sofa -- the sacred sofa where a bubble of paradise had once burst in slow motion within me. She rearranged the furniture -- and was pleased when she found, in a household treatise, that "it is permissible to separate a pair of sofa commodes and their companion lamps." With the authoress of Your Home Is You, she developed a hatred for little lean chairs and spindle tables. She believed that a room having a generous expanse of glass, and lots of rich wood paneling was an example of the masculine type of room, whereas the feminine type was characterized by lighter-looking windows and frailer woodwork. The novels I had found her reading when I moved in were now replaced by illustrated catalogues and homemaking guides. From a firm located at 4640 Roosevelt Blvd., Philadelphia, she ordered for our double bed a "damask covered 312 coil mattress"-- although the old one seemed to me resilient and durable enough for whatever it had to support.</div>

<div class="line_en">A Midwesterner, as her late husband had also been, she had lived in coy Ramsdale, the gem of an eastern state, not long enough to know all the nice people. She knew slightly the jovial dentist who lived in a kind of ramshackle wooden chateau behind our lawn. She had met at a church tea the "snooty" wife of the local junk dealer who owned the "colonial" white horror at the corner of the avenue. Now and then she "visited with" old Miss Opposite; but the more patrician matrons among those she called upon, or met at lawn functions, or had telephone chats with -- such dainty ladies as Mrs. Glave, Mrs. Sheridan, Mrs. McCrystal, Mrs. Knight and others, seldom seemed to call on my neglected Charlotte. Indeed, the only couple with whom she had relations of real cordiality, devoid of any arrière-pensée or practical foresight, were the Farlows who had just come back from a business trip to Chile in time to attend our wedding, with the Chatfields, McCoos, and a few others (but not Mrs. Junk or the even prouder Mrs. Talbot). John Farlow was a middle-aged, quiet, quietly athletic, quietly successful dealer in sporting goods, who had an office at Parkington, forty miles away: it was he who got me the cartridges for that Colt and showed me how to use it, during a walk in the woods one Sunday; he was also what he called with a smile a part-time lawyer and had handled some of Charlotte's affairs. Jean, his youngish wife (and first cousin), was a long-limbed girl in harlequin glasses with two boxer dogs, two pointed breasts and a big red mouth. She painted -- landscapes and portraits -- and vividly do I remember praising, over cocktails, the picture she had made of a niece of hers, little Rosaline Honeck, a rosy honey in a Girl Scout uniform, beret of green worsted, belt of green webbing, charming shoulder-long curls -- and John removed his pipe and said it was a pity Dolly (my Dolita) and Rosaline were so critical of each other at school, but he hoped they would get on better when they returned from their respective camps. We talked of the school. It had its drawbacks, and it had its virtues. "Of course, too many of the tradespeople here are Italians," said John, "but on the other hand we are still spared --"</div>
