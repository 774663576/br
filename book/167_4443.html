<div class="line_en">It was the biggest tree Jon Snow had ever seen, the trunk near eight feet wide, the branches spreading so far that the entire village was shaded beneath their canopy. The size did not disturb him so much as the face… the mouth especially, no simple carved slash, but a jagged hollow large enough to swallow a sheep.</div>

<div class="line_en">Whitetree, the village was named on Sam's old maps. Jon did not think it much of a village. Four tumbledown one-room houses of unmortared stone surrounded an empty sheepfold and a well. The houses were roofed with sod, the windows shuttered with ragged pieces of hide. And above them loomed the pale limbs and dark red leaves of a monstrous great weirwood.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="根据山姆找到的古老地图，这里叫白树村，但在琼恩眼中，此地实在算不上什么村庄：四栋单以石块砌成，没刷砂浆的单房屋子，业已倒塌，环绕着空空的羊圈和一口井。房舍的屋顶铺着草皮，窗户则用破烂的毛皮遮盖。房屋上方有一棵高大畸形的鱼梁木，暗红的叶子，苍白的枝干。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He knelt and reached a gloved hand down into the maw. The inside of the hollow was red with dried sap and blackened by fire. Beneath the skull he saw another, smaller, the jaw broken off. It was half-buried in ash and bits of bone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他蹲下来，伸出戴着手套的手探进树口。树洞内满是干涸的红色树汁，被火烧得焦黑。他在骷髅头下又看到另一个比较小的头骨，下巴开裂，半掩于灰烬和碎骨中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jon dismounted. Slung across his back in a black leather shoulder sheath was Longclaw, the hand-and-a-half bastard blade the Old Bear had given him for saving his life. A bastard sword for a bastard, the men joked. The hilt had been fashioned new for him, adorned with a wolf's-head pommel in pale stone, but the blade itself was Valyrian steel, old and light and deadly sharp.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="琼恩听令下马。他背后斜挂长爪，包着黑皮革剑鞘。长爪是一把一手半用的长柄剑，是熊老为感谢琼恩救他一命而特意相赠。别人总爱笑话这是“杂种拿的杂种剑”。剑柄专门为他重新打造，圆球用淡色白石雕成狼头形状。剑刃本身则是瓦雷利亚钢，古老、轻盈且锐利。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When he brought the skull to Mormont, the Old Bear lifted it in both hands and stared into the empty sockets. "The wildlings burn their dead. We've always known that. Now I wished I'd asked them why, when there were still a few around to ask."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他将头骨拿给莫尔蒙，熊老双手举起，望进骷髅空洞的眼窝。“野人会烧掉他们的死者，这事我们早就知道。唉，只可惜以前还有人迹可寻的时候，没有问问他们为何这么做。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Would that bones could talk," the Old Bear grumbled. "This fellow could tell us much. How he died. Who burned him, and why. Where the wildlings have gone." He sighed. "The children of the forest could speak to the dead, it's said. But I can't." He tossed the skull back into the mouth of the tree, where it landed with a puff of fine ash. "Go through all these houses. Giant, get to the top of this tree, have a look. I'll have the hounds brought up too. Perchance this time the trail will be fresher." His tone did not suggest that he held out much hope of the last.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“若是骨头会说话就好了，”熊老咕哝，“这家伙可以告诉咱们不少事：他怎么死的？谁烧了他？为什么要烧？野人都跑哪里去了？”他叹口气，“传说森林之子能和死者交谈，可惜我不能。”他把骷髅头掷回树洞，扬起一阵灰烬。“给我仔细搜寻这几间房屋。‘巨人’，你上树看看。把猎犬带过来，或许这次留下的踪迹比较新鲜。”但他的口气对后者却颇不以为然。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Two men went through each house, to make certain nothing was missed. Jon was paired with dour Eddison Tollett, a squire grey of hair and thin as a pike, whom the other brothers called Dolorous Edd. "Bad enough when the dead come walking," he said to Jon as they crossed the village, "now the Old Bear wants them talking as well? No good will come of that, I'll warrant. And who's to say the bones wouldn't lie? Why should death make a man truthful, or even clever? The dead are likely dull fellows, full of tedious complaints -- the ground's too cold, my gravestone should be larger, why does he get more worms than I do…"</div>

<div class="line_en">The smell was very faint. "Old dung," said Jon. The house felt as though it had been empty for some time. Kneeling, he searched through the straw with his hands to see if anything had been concealed beneath, then made a round of the walls. It did not take very long. "There's nothing here."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="味道很淡，“应该干掉很久了，”琼恩说。屋子似乎空弃了一段时间，他跪下来，伸手拨弄稻草堆，看看下面是否有所隐藏，接着又沿墙仔细搜索。一无所获。“这儿什么也没有。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jon had to stoop to pass through the low door. Within he found a packed dirt floor. There were no furnishings, no sign that people had lived here but for some ashes beneath the smoke hole in the roof. "What a dismal place to live," he said.</div>

"What do you think happened to them all?" Jon asked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他原本就不预期会有所发现，白树村是他们北行以来经过的第四个聚落，每个地方的情形都一样，居民早已带着少得可怜的家当和所有的牲口悄然离去。而这些村庄又没有任何遭受攻击的迹象，只是单纯地…空无一人。“你觉得他们到底碰上了什么？”琼恩问。">查看中文翻译</div>

Chett was cursing them loudly, his voice thick with the anger he never seemed to put aside.

Thoren Smallwood looked more a lord than Mormont did, clad in Ser Jaremy Rykker's gleaming black mail and embossed breastplate.

<div class="line_en">Jon heard a rustling from the red leaves above. Two branches parted, and he glimpsed a little man moving from limb to limb as easily as a squirrel. Bedwyck stood no more than five feet tall, but the grey streaks in his hair showed his age. The other rangers called him Giant. He sat in a fork of the tree over their heads and said, "There's water to the north. A lake, might be. A few flint hills rising to the west, not very high. Nothing else to see, my lords."</div>

<div class="line_en">Jon mounted his garron, wheeled him about, and trotted off. Beyond the shade of the great weirwood the men of the Night's Watch stood beneath lesser trees, tending their horses, chewing strips of salt beef, pissing, scratching, and talking. When the command was given to move out again, the talk died, and they climbed back into their saddles. Jarman Buckwell's scouts rode out first, with the vanguard under Thoren Smallwood heading the column proper. Then came the Old Bear with the main force, Ser Mallador Locke with the baggage train and packhorses, and finally Ser Ottyn Wythers and the rear guard. Two hundred men all told, with half again as many mounts.</div>

He wondered how she was faring. It made him a little sad to think that he might never muss her hair again. He began to flex his hand, opening and closing the fingers. If he let his sword hand stiffen and grow clumsy, it well might be the end of him, he knew. A man needed his sword beyond the Wall.</div>

<div class="line_en">By day they followed game trails and streambeds, the "ranger's roads" that led them ever deeper into the wilderness of leaf and root. At night they camped beneath a starry sky and gazed up at the comet. The black brothers had left Castle Black in good spirits, joking and trading tales, but of late the brooding silence of the wood seemed to have sombered them all. Jests had grown fewer and tempers shorter. No one would admit to being afraid -- they were men of the Night's Watch, after all -- but Jon could feel the unease. Four empty villages, no wildlings anywhere, even the game seemingly fled. The haunted forest had never seemed more haunted, even veteran rangers agreed.</div>

The first night, every time I heard someone getting up to make water, I thought it was wildlings creeping in to slit my throat. I was afraid that if I closed my eyes, I might never open them again, only… well… dawn came after all." He managed a wan smile. "I may be craven, but I'm not stupid. I'm sore and my back aches from riding and from sleeping on the ground, but I'm hardly scared at all. Look." He held out a hand for Jon to see how steady it was. "I've been working on my maps."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嗯，”山姆说，“是啊，不过…我已经没那么害怕了，真的。头天晚上，每当我听见有人起来如恭，都以为是野人偷摸进来要割我喉咙。我生怕自己眼睛一闭就再没机会睁开，可是…嗯…到天亮还是没事。”他勉强挤出一丝笑容，“我胆子虽小，却并不笨。我骑马骑到脚破皮，躺在地上睡得腰酸背痛，可我现在已经不怕了。你瞧，”他试图向琼恩展示自己的手掌有多沉稳。“这几天，我一直在研究地图。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The world is strange, Jon thought. Two hundred brave men had left the Wall, and the only one who was not growing more fearful was Sam, the self-confessed coward. "We'll make a ranger of you yet," he joked. "Next thing, you'll want to be an outrider like Grenn. Shall I speak to the Old Bear?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="世事实在难料，琼恩心想，两百勇士离开长城，其中唯一没有越来越怕的竟是山姆这个众所皆知的懦夫。“我看你是块当游骑兵的料，”他玩笑道，“再隔几天，你就会想学葛兰的样，当个侦察兵了。怎么，要不我去跟熊老建议？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ghost emerged from the undergrowth so suddenly that the garron shied and reared. The white wolf hunted well away from the line of march, but he was not having much better fortune than the foragers Smallwood sent out after game. The woods were as empty as the villages, Dywen had told him one night around the fire. "We're a large party," Jon had said. "The game's probably been frightened away by all the noise we make on the march."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="白灵突然从矮树丛里窜出，吓得马儿连忙前脚跃起，躲了开去。白狼跑到离队伍很远的地方觅食，但相比斯莫伍德派去收集食物的人，它的运气也好不了多少。森林里和村落一样空荡荡的，某天晚上，戴文在营火边告诉他。“我们队伍庞大，”琼恩对他说，“猎物大概早被行军的噪音吓跑了吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Frightened away by something, no doubt," Dywen said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他们是被吓跑的，至于被啥东西，我可就不敢说了。”戴文道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Too few roofs for all of us." Jon mounted again, gave Sam a parting smile, and rode off. The column was well under way, so he swung wide around the village to avoid the worst of the congestion. He had seen enough of Whitetree.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“就那几间屋也不够啊。”琼恩也上了马，冲山姆笑笑，然后策马离去。队伍已经行动起来，所以他远远绕过村庄，避开拥挤的人流，反正白树村他也看够了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Once the horse had settled, Ghost loped along easily beside him. Jon caught up to Mormont as he was wending his way around a hawthorn thicket. "Is the bird away?" the Old Bear asked.</div>

Well, we'll be three hundred when Qhorin joins us. Whatever enemy waits out here will not find us so easy to deal with. We will find them, Jon, I promise you."</div>
