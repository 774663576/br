<div class="line_en">The loess hills here had little vegetation cover. Rifts from erosion made the slopes look like old faces full of wrinkles. After selecting a few possible sites, the task force stayed for a brief rest at a village where most of the inhabitants still lived in traditional cave dwellings. The village's production team leader recognized Ye as an educated person and asked her whether she knew how to speak a foreign language. She asked him which foreign language, and he said he didn't know. However, if she did know a foreign tongue, he would send someone up the hill to call down Bethune, because the production team needed to discuss something with him.</div>

<div class="line_en">Half a year after her return to Tsinghua, Ye took on an important task: the design of a large radio astronomy observatory. She and the task force traveled around the country to find the best site for the observatory. The initial considerations were purely technical. Unlike traditional astronomy, radio astronomy didn't have as many demands on atmospheric quality, but required minimal electromagnetic interference. They traveled to many places and finally picked a place with the cleanest electromagnetic environment: a remote, hilly area in the Northwest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="回到大学半年后，叶文洁就承担了一个重大课题：一个大型射电天文观测基地的设计。不久，她就同课题组一起外出为基地选址。最初的考虑是纯技术上的，与传统的天文观测不同，射电天文对大气质量和可见光干扰的要求不高，但要尽量避免非可见光频段的电磁干扰。他们跑了许多地方，最后选择了一个电磁环境最优的地点，这是西北的一个偏僻山区。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ye and the others soon saw the foreigner. Other than his blond hair and green eyes and tattered jeans and a jacket that reminded her of a cowboy, he didn't look too different from the local peasants who had labored all their lives. Even his skin had the same dark hue from the sun as the locals. He didn't show much interest in the visitors. He introduced himself as Mike Evans without mentioning his nationality, but his English was clearly American-accented. He lived in a simple two-room adobe hut, which was filled with tools for planting trees: hoes, shovels, saws for pruning tree branches, and so on, all of which were locally made and crude. The dust that permeated the Northwest lay in a thin layer over his simple and rough-hewn bed and kitchen implements. A pile of books, most of which dealt with biology, sat on his bed. Ye noticed a copy of Peter Singer's Animal Liberation. The only sign of modernity was a small radio set, hooked up to an external D battery. There was also an old telescope.</div>

They nest only here, but as the forest disappears year after year, they can no longer find the trees in which to build their nests. When I discovered them, the species had less than ten thousand individuals left. If the trend continues, within five years it will be extinct.

<div class="line_en">"That afternoon, I went to see the hellish coast. The sea was black, and the waves, under the sticky, thick film of oil, were smooth and weak. The beach was also covered by a black layer of crude oil. Some volunteers and I searched for birds on the beach that were still alive. They struggled in the sticky oil, looking like black statues made out of asphalt, only their eyes proving that they were still alive. Those eyes staring out of the oil still haunt my dreams to this day. We soaked those birds in detergent, trying to get rid of the oil stuck to their bodies. But it was extremely difficult: crude oil was infused into their feathers, and if you brushed a little too hard, the feathers would come off with the oil… By that evening, most of the birds had died. As I sat on the black beach, exhausted and covered in oil, I stared at the sun setting over a black sea and felt like it was the end of the world."</div>

The world first became a sea of fire, and then sank into a prolonged period of darkness and coldness… One night, you woke from a nightmare, saying that you had dreamt that you were back in that terrifying age. Let me tell you now what I wanted to tell you that night: If you really lived during the Cretaceous Period, you'd be fortunate. The period we live in now is far more frightening. Right now, species on Earth are going extinct far faster than during the late Cretaceous. Now is truly the age of mass extinctions! So, my child, what you're seeing is nothing. This is only an insignificant episode in a much vaster process. We can have no sea birds, but we can't be without oil. Can you imagine life without oil? Your last birthday, I gave you that lovely Ferrari and promised you that you could drive it after you turned fifteen. But without oil, it would be a pile of junk metal and you'd never drive it. Right now, if you want to visit your grandfather, you can get there on my personal jet and cross the ocean in a dozen hours or so. But without oil, you'd have to tumble in a sailboat for more than a month… These are the rules of the game of civilization: The first priority is to guarantee the existence of the human race and their comfortable life. Everything else is secondary.'"</div>

<div class="line_en">As soon as she climbed onto that small hillock, she saw the forest again. Because the trees had grown, it now seemed far denser, but Ye noticed that the forest had once been much bigger. Newer parts that had grown in the past few years had already been cut. The logging was in full swing. In every direction, trees were falling. The entire forest seemed like a mulberry leaf being devoured by silkworms on all sides. At the current rate, it would disappear soon. The workers doing the logging came from two nearby villages. Using axes and saws, they cut down those barely grown trees one by one, and then dragged them off the hill using tractors and ox carts. There were many loggers, and fights frequently erupted among them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当她登上那座小山顶时，立刻看到了那片树林，面积与三年前差不多，但由于树木的成长，看上去密了许多。不过，叶文洁很快发现，这片林子的面积曾经扩大了许多，但现在，扩大的部分已被砍伐了——砍伐仍在热火朝天地进行，在林子的各个方向都有树木不断地倒下，整个林子像一片被许多只蚜虫蚕食的绿叶，照这个速度很快就会消失。砍树的村民来自附近的两个村子，他们用斧子和板锯把那些刚刚成长起来的小树一棵棵地放倒，然后用拖拉机和牛车运下山去。砍树的很多，不断有激烈的争执发生。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The adobe hut looked the same, but Evans wasn't inside. Ye found him in the woods holding an ax and carefully pruning a tree. He had obviously been at it for a while, his posture full of exhaustion.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那两间土坯房还是原样，但伊文斯不在里面，叶文洁在树林里找到了他，他正拿着一把斧子一心一意地修剪树枝，显然已经干了很久，一副疲惫不堪的样子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Evans stopped and stared at Ye in surprise. Light from the setting sun slanted through the trees and made his eyes sparkle. "Ye, do you really think I'm doing this because of this forest?" He laughed and shook his head, then dropped the ax. He sat down, his back against a tree. "If I want to stop them, it'd be easy. I just returned from America. My father died two months ago, and I inherited most of his money. My brother and sister only got five million each. This wasn't what I expected at all. Maybe in his heart, he still respected me. Or maybe he respected my ideals. Not including fixed assets, do you know how much money I have at my disposal? About four point five billion dollars. I could easily ask them to stop and get them to plant more trees. I could make all the loess hills within sight be covered by quick-growth forest. But what would be the point? Everything you see before you is the result of poverty. But how are things any better in the wealthy countries? They protect their own environments, but then shift the heavily polluting industries to the poorer nations. You probably know that the American government just refused to sign the Kyoto Protocol… The entire human race is the same. As long as civilization continues to develop, the swallows I want to save and all the other swallows will go extinct. It's just a matter of time."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="伊文斯停下来，用很惊奇的目光看着叶文洁，夕阳透过重重林木照进来，在他的眸子中闪亮。“叶，你真的以为我是为了这片树林？”他笑着摇摇头，扔下了手中的斧子，靠着一棵树坐了下来，“我现在要想制止他们，轻而易举。”他把一只空的工具袋放到地上，示意叶文洁坐下，接着说，“我刚从美国回来，父亲在两个月前去世，我继承了他的大部分遗产。哥哥和姐姐只各得了五百万。这让我很意外，真的没想到他最后能对我这样，也许，他在内心深处还是看重我的，或者，看重我的理想。不把不动产算在内，知道我现在能支配的钱有多少吗？大约四十五亿美元。我可以轻而易举地让他们停止砍树，然后让他们种树，让我们目力所及的黄土山都被这样的速生林覆盖，很容易，但有什么意义呢？你看到的一切可以归结为贫穷，但富裕的国家又怎么样？他们营造自己的优美环境，却把重污染工业向穷国转移，你可能知道，美国政府刚刚拒绝签署京都议定书……整个人类本质上都一样，只要文明像这样发展，我想拯救的这种燕子，还有其他的燕子，迟早都会灭绝，只是时间问题。”">查看中文翻译</div>
