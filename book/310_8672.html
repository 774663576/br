<div class="line_en">It seems to me a very difficult thing to put into words the beliefs we hold and what they make you do in your life. I think I was fortunate because I grew up in a family where there was a very deep religious feeling. I don't think it was spoken of a great deal. It was more or less taken for granted that everybody held certain beliefs and needed certain reinforcements of their own strength and that came through your belief in God and your knowledge of prayer.</div>

<div class="line_en">But as I grew older I questioned a great many of the things that I knew very well my grandmother who had brought me up had taken for granted. And I think I might have been quite a difficult person to live with if it hadn't been for the fact that my husband once said it didn't do you any harm to learn those things, so why not let your children learn them? When they grow up they'll think things out for themselves.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，随着年龄的增长，在祖母身边长大的我也开始质疑那些在她眼中理所应当的东西。我甚至将这些东西拒之门外，仿佛自己成了一个很难相处的人。直到有一次，我的丈夫劝我，这些东西你也学过，对你并无害处，为什么不让孩子们接触呢？他们长大后会懂得如何独立思考这些问题。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And that gave me a feeling that perhaps that's what we all must do -- think out for ourselves what we could believe and how we could live by it. And so I came to the conclusion that you had to use this life to develop the very best that you could develop.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="丈夫的一番话让我觉得，或许我们每个人都应该这么做——独立思考自己的信仰以及如何在生活中坚守这些信仰。于是，我意识到，人的一生就应该尽力让自己做到最好。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And so I have tried to follow that out -- and not to worry about the future or what was going to happen. I think I am pretty much of a fatalist. You have to accept whatever comes and the only important thing is that you meet it with courage and with the best that you have to give.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我就是这样听从自己的信仰，不再担心未来，不再为即将发生的事情忧心。我想我是一个十足的宿命论者。无论发生什么，你都要勇敢面对。最重要的是，面对的时候别忘了要勇敢，要倾尽全力。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I don't know whether I believe in a future life. I believe that all that you go through here must have some value, therefore there must be some reason. And there must be some "going on". How exactly that happens I've never been able to decide. There is a future -- that I'm sure of. But how, that I don't know. And I came to feel that it didn't really matter very much because whatever the future held you'd have to face it when you came to it, just as whatever life holds you have to face it in exactly the same way. And the important thing was that you never let down doing the best that you were able to do -- it might be poor because you might not have very much within you to give, or to help other people with, or to live your life with. But as long as you did the very best that you were able to do, then that was what you were put here to do and that was what you were accomplishing by being here.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我不知道自己是否相信未来。我相信的是，你所经历的一切都是有价值的，因此也必定是有道理的，必定预示着某些事情即将到来。至于这些事情是如何发生的，我无法决定。但我深信，一定会有未来。至于未来会如何来临，我无从所知。可我开始觉得这一点并不重要，因为无论未来如何，我们都要面对。那么真正重要的是——倾尽全力做到最好。也许你能力有限，帮不上什么大忙，或者无法让自己的生活精彩。但是，只要你倾尽全力，完成自己来到世上的使命，那你就不枉此生了。">查看中文翻译</div>
