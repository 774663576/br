<div class="line_en">"We can't get rid of this," he said. "We really can't." He found an old, broken chair and sat down at the piano. His fingers touched the keys. He closed his eyes. Half-forgotten music danced through his mind. His fingers began to move. They moved up and down the keys. He began to play an old song. He was suddenly very happy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们不能把它扔掉，”他说，“绝对不行。”他找来一把破旧的椅子，坐在钢琴前，手指抚过琴键。他闭上眼睛，忘得差不多的音乐在脑海中跳跃。他开始移动手指，在琴键上流畅地敲击。他开始弹奏一首古老的曲子，忽然之间感到非常幸福。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The piano was made of beautiful, dark brown wood. Tony took off his shirt and cleaned the wood with it. He saw brightly-coloured birds, flowers and leaves. They shone like stars in the dark, dirty building. Tony opened the piano. He looked at the keys.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I can't read music," said Tony. "We didn't have music lessons at my school." He looked unhappy and thoughtful. "Music!" thought Tony.

"We sang a little on Tuesday mornings, that's all," he said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不识乐谱，”托尼答道，“我们学校里不开音乐课。”他变得忧郁起来，一副若有所思的样子。“音乐！”托尼在心里念着。他想起了那个带着小猴子的流浪琴师，然后他又想到了拉克夫人。他回忆起那些美妙的星期二的早晨，微微笑了起来。“我们只在每个星期二的早晨唱一会儿歌，仅此而已。”他说。">查看中文翻译</div>
