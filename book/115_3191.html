<div class="line_en">The housemaid Alice had been so superior. I used to sneak my chemise and nightgowns out of my drawer and mend them myself rather than ask her to do them. I had seen her once, with one of my chemises over her arm, examining the plain material with its small edging of lace. I shall never forget her expression. She looked almost shocked, as though her own personal pride had received a blow. I had never thought about my underclothes before. As long as they were clean and neat I had not thought the material or the existence of lace mattered.</div>

<div class="line_en">I did not see much of Mrs Danvers. She kept very much to herself. She still rang the house telephone to the morning-room every day and submitted the menu to me as a matter of form, but that was the limit of our intercourse. She had engaged a maid for me, Clarice, the daughter of somebody on the estate, a nice quiet well-mannered girl, who, thank heaven, had never been in service before and had no alarming standards. I think she was the only person in the house who stood in awe of me. To her I was the mistress: I was Mrs de Winter. The possible gossip of the others could not affect her. She had been away for some time, brought up by an aunt fifteen miles away, and in a sense she was as new to Manderley as I was. I felt at ease with her. I did not mind saying "Oh, Clarice, would you mend my stocking?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我难得见着丹弗斯太太，她闭门独处，轻易不露面。虽然她每天打内线电话到展室来，让我审定菜单，不过这纯粹是例行公事，而我们平日间的接触也仅止于此。她替我找了个贴身使女，名叫克拉丽斯，是庄园内某个下人的闺女。这姑娘文静，举止得体，很讨人喜欢。幸亏她过去从未当过女佣，因此没有那一套吓人的量人度物的准则。在整个宅子里，我看，只有她还算对我怀有几分敬畏，也只有在她的心目中，我才是这儿的女主人，是德温特夫人。仆役中间传播的那些流言蜚语可能对她没起任何作用。她曾有好一阵子不在庄园。她是在十五英里外的婶母家长大的。从某种意义上说，她和我一样是初来曼陀丽的陌生人。我在她面前感到轻松自如。我可以满不在乎地说：“哦，克拉丽斯，替我补一补袜子行吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I often wondered whether Alice told the others, and if my underclothes became a topic of conversation in the servants' hall, something rather dreadful, to be discussed in low tones when the men were nowhere about. She was too superior for it to be made a joking question. Phrases like "Chemise to you" would never be bandied between her and Frith, for instance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我常在怀疑，艾丽斯是不是曾把这件事在仆役中间捅出去，我的内衣会不会已成了下房里议论的内容。当然，这种事儿不成体统，只能起男仆不在时窃窃私语一番。艾丽斯颇为自矜，所以不会让这事作为笑料闹个满城风雨，例如，在她与弗里思之间就从未有过“把这件女用内衣拿去”之类不登大雅之堂的对话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Brides one read about had trousseaux, dozens of sets at a time, and I had never bothered. Alice's face taught me a lesson. I wrote quickly to a shop in London and asked for a catalogue of under-linen. By the time I had made my choice Alice was looking after me no longer and Clarice was installed instead. It seemed such a waste buying new underclothes for Clarice that I put the catalogue away in a drawer and never wrote to the shop after all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在书上曾读到新娘出嫁时，得一下子张罗几十套衣服作为嫁妆，而我压根儿没操过这份心。艾丽斯脸上的那副神情，不啻是给我上了一课，我赶紧向伦敦的一家店铺西索内衣目录。等我选定我要的内衣时，艾丽斯已不再服侍我，克拉丽斯接替了她的位置。为了克拉丽斯的缘故去购置新内衣，似乎太不值得，所以我把内衣目录往抽屉里一塞，再没写信向那店铺定货。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">No, my underclothes were more serious than that. More like a divorce case heard in camera… At any rate I was glad when Alice surrendered me to Clarice. Clarice would never know real lace from false. It was considerate of Mrs Danvers to have engaged her. She must have thought we would be fit company, one for the other. Now that I knew the reason for Mrs Danvers' dislike and resentment it made things a little easier. I knew it was not just me personally she hated, but what I represented. She would have felt the same towards anyone who had taken Rebecca's place. At least that was what I understood from Beatrice the day she came to lunch.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不，关于内衣的轶事可不能视同笑料，这事要严重得多，更像是私下打听到一桩离婚案…不管怎么说，艾丽斯把我扔给克拉丽斯，我是很高兴的。克拉丽斯根本分辨不出花边的真假。丹弗斯太太雇她来眼侍我，真可谓体贴周到呢。她一定觉得我和克拉丽斯作伴，乃是天造地设，各得其所。现在我既然已弄清丹弗斯太太厌恶和恼怒的原因所在，反倒觉得好受些了。我明白她为之咬牙切齿的并非我本人，而是我所代表的一切。不管谁来占去吕蓓卡的位置，她都会一视同仁。至少在比阿特丽斯来吃饭那天，我从她的话里听出了这层弦外之音。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Frank had told me to forget the past, and I wanted to forget it. But Frank did not have to sit in the morning-room as I did, every day, and touch the pen she had held between her fingers. He did not have to rest his hands on the blotter, and stare in front of him at her writing on the pigeon-holes. He did not have to look at the candlesticks on the mantelpiece, the clock, the vase in which the flowers stood, the pictures on the walls and remember, every day, that they belonged to her, she had chosen them, they were not mine at all. Frank did not have to sit at her place in the dining-room, hold the knife and fork that she had held, drink from her glass. He did not throw a coat over his shoulders which had been hers, nor find her handkerchief in the pocket. He did not notice, every day, as I did, the blind gaze of the old dog in its basket in the library, who lifted its head when it heard my footstep, the footstep of a woman, and sniffing the air drooped its head again, because I was not the one she sought.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="弗兰克要我忘掉过去，我自己也想把往事置诸脑后。可是弗兰克不必像我那样，每天坐在晨室里，触摸那支曾夹在她手指间的钢笔。他不必把手按在吸墨纸台上，两眼盯着面前的文件架，望着她留在那上面的字迹。他不必每天看着壁炉上的烛台、时钟、插着鲜花的花瓶，还有墙上的绘画，心里想着这一切原都归她所有，是她生前选中的，没有一样是我的。在餐厅里，弗兰克也无须坐在她的位子上，握着她生前握过的刀叉，还得从她用过的杯子里喝着什么。他未曾把她的雨衣披在肩上，也没有在口袋里摸到过她的手绢。每天我还注意到那条瞎眼老狗的茫然眼神，它蜷缩在藏书室的篓子里，一听到我的脚步声，一个女人的脚步声，总是抬起头来，用鼻子嗅嗅空气，随即又耷拉下脑袋，因为我不是它所期待寻找的人——而这些弗兰克是不会留神顾及的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The words had shocked me at the time. Somehow I had not expected them. But when I thought it over I began to lose my first fear of Mrs Danvers. I began to be sorry for her. I could imagine what she must feel. It must hurt her every time she heard me called "Mrs de Winter". Every morning when she took up the house telephone and spoke to me, and I answered "Yes, Mrs Danvers," she must be thinking of another voice. When she passed through the rooms and saw traces of me about the place, a beret on a window-seat, a bag of knitting on a chair, she must think of another one, who had done these things before. Even as I did. I, who had never known Rebecca. Mrs Danvers knew how she walked and how she spoke. Mrs Danvers knew the colour of her eyes, her smile, the texture of her hair. I knew none of these things, I had never asked about them, but sometimes I felt Rebecca was as real to me as she was to Mrs Danvers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我当时听了，着实为之一震。不知怎么地，我没料到她会说出这几句话。然而反复思量之后，我原对丹弗斯太太的那种恐惧感却开始淡薄了。我反而可怜起她来。我体会得出她内心的感受。每当别人称呼我“德温特夫人”时，她听了一定很伤心。她每天早晨拿起内线电话跟我说话，而我照例答以“好的，丹弗斯太太”，这时她势必在怀念着另一个人的嗓音。她穿堂越室，到处看到我留下的踪迹——撂在临窗座位上的软帽，搁在椅子上的编结袋——一定会触景生情，联想起以前也曾在屋里四处留下踪迹的另一个人。就连我也难免产生这种念头，说起来我同吕蓓卡还是素不相识的呢？丹弗斯太太可不同了，她熟悉吕蓓卡走路的姿势，听惯了她说话的声调。丹弗斯太太知道她眸子的色泽，她脸上的笑容，还有她发丝的纹路。我对这些一无所知，也从来不向别人打听，可有时候我觉得吕蓓卡对于我，也像对于丹弗斯太太一样，是个音容宛在的亡灵。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Little things, meaningless and stupid in themselves, but they were there for me to see, for me to hear, for me to feel. Dear God, I did not want to think about Rebecca. I wanted to be happy, to make Maxim happy, and I wanted us to be together. There was no other wish in my heart but that. I could not help it if she came to me in thoughts, in dreams. I could not help it if I felt like a guest in Manderley, my home, walking where she had trodden, resting where she had lain. I was like a guest, biding my time, waiting for the return of the hostess. Little sentences, little reproofs reminding me every hour, every day.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Frith," I said, coming into the library on a summer morning, my arms full of lilac, "Frith, where can I find a tall vase for these? They are all too small in the flower-room."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“弗里思，”一个夏日的早晨，我抱着一大束紫丁香走进藏书室，一面吩咐说，“弗里思，能找个长颈花瓶把这些花插上吗？花房里的花瓶都嫌小。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“太太，那只石膏花瓶德温特夫人一向用的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then the alabaster vase was brought for me, already filled with water, and as I put the sweet lilac in the vase and arranged the sprigs, one by one, the mauve warm scent filling the room, mingling with the smell of the new-mown lawn outside coming from the open window, I thought: "Rebecca did this. She took the lilac, as I am doing, and put the sprigs one by one in the white vase. I'm not the first to do it. This is Rebecca's vase, this is Rebecca's lilac" She must have wandered out into the garden as I did, in that floppy garden hat that I had seen once at the back of the cupboard in the flower-room, hidden under some old cushions, and crossed the lawn to the lilac bushes, whistling perhaps, humming a tune, calling to the dogs to follow her, carrying in her hands the scissors that I carried now.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是，那只石膏花瓶拿来了，里面已装满水。我把浓香扑鼻的丁香花插进去，一枝一枝摆弄舒齐。屋子里洋溢着紫红色花朵散发的芬芳；从敞开的窗户处，还不时飘来刚整修过的草坪的阵阵清香。我暗自寻思；“吕蓓卡也是这么做的。她也像我这样，拿起紫丁香，一枝一枝插入这只白花瓶。我并不是第一个想到要这么做的人。花瓶是吕蓓卡的，丁香花也是昌蓓卡的。”她必然像我一样，信步走进花园，头上戴一顶边沿下垂的园艺帽，就是我曾在花房里看到过压在几个旧靠垫下面的那一顶。她步履轻盈地穿过草地，朝丁香花丛走去，也许一边哼小调，一边打唿哨招呼身后的两条狗，要它们跟上来，手里还拿着我此刻握着的这把剪刀。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Beatrice remembered her promise of a wedding present. A large parcel arrived one morning, almost too large for Robert to carry. I was sitting in the morning-room, having just read the menu for the day. I have always had a childish love of parcels. I snipped the string excitedly, and tore off the dark brown paper. It looked like books. I was right. It was books. Four big volumes. A History of Painting. And a sheet of note-paper in the first volume saying "I hope this is the sort of thing you like," and signed "Love from Beatrice." I could see her going into the shop in Wigmore Street and buying them. Looking about her in her abrupt, rather masculine way. "I want a set of books for someone who is keen on Art," she would say, and the attendant would answer, "Yes, Madam, will you come this way." She would finger the volumes a little suspiciously. "Yes, that's about the price. It's for a wedding present. I want them to look good. Are these all about Art?"</div>

<div class="line_en">It was nice of Beatrice. There was something rather sincere and pathetic about her going off to a shop in London and buying me these books because she knew I was fond of painting. She imagined me, I expect, sitting down on a wet day and looking solemnly at the illustrations, and perhaps getting a sheet of drawing-paper and a paint-box and copying one of the pictures. Dear Beatrice. I had a sudden, stupid desire to cry. I gathered up the heavy volumes and looked round the morning-room for somewhere to put them. They were out of place in that fragile delicate room. Never mind, it was my room now, after all. I arranged them in a row on the top of the desk. They swayed dangerously, leaning one against the other. I stood back a bit, to watch the effect. Perhaps I moved too quickly, and it disturbed them. At any rate the foremost one fell, and the others slid after him. They upset a little china cupid who had hitherto stood alone on the desk except for the candlesticks. He fell to the ground, hitting the waste-paper basket as he did so, and broke into fragments. I glanced hurriedly at the door, like a guilty child. I knelt on the floor and swept up the pieces into my hand. I found an envelope to put them in. I hid the envelope at the back of one of the drawers in the desk. Then I took the books off to the library and found room for them on the shelves.</div>

"How absurd to say we are not companions," I said; "why look how we sit here every evening, you with a book or a paper, and me with my knitting. Just like cups of tea. Just like old people, married for years and years. Of course we are companions. Of course we are happy. You talk as though you thought we had made a mistake?

<div class="line_en">He did not answer. He went on staring out of the window while I held his hands. My throat felt dry and tight, and my eyes were burning. Oh, God, I thought, this is like two people in a play, in a moment the curtain will come down, we shall bow to the audience, and go off to our dressing-rooms. This can't be a real moment in the lives of Maxim and myself. I sat down on the window-seat, and let go of his hands. I heard myself speaking in a hard cool voice. "If you don't think we are happy it would be much better if you would admit it. I don't want you to pretend anything. I'd much rather go away. Not live with you any more." It was not really happening of course. It was the girl in the play talking, not me to Maxim. I pictured the type of girl who would play the part. Tall and slim, rather nervy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他没有回答我。他的眼睛还是凝望窗外。我握着他的双手，感到嗓门干涩，简直透不过气来，眼睛也感到火辣辣的。我心想，天哪，我们俩好像是在台上演戏，过一会儿就要幕落，我俩将朝观众鞠躬，然后走下舞台卸装。这决不可能是迈克西姆和我真实生活中的一个瞬间！我又在临窗座位上坐下，放开他的双手。我听到自己用一种冷若冰霜的声调说：“如果你真的觉得我们生活得不愉快，直截了当地说出来，岂不更好。我并不希望你言不由衷。我宁可走开，不再跟你在一起生活。”这席话，自然并非出于真心，这是舞台上那个姑娘的台词，而不是我对迈克西姆说的真心话。我在暗自勾勒那个角色该由什么样的姑娘来扮演，她该是：高高的个儿，苗条的身材，敢作敢为。">查看中文翻译</div>

He is remembering who gave it to Rebecca. He is going over in his mind how the parcel came and how pleased she was. Rebecca knew a lot about china. Perhaps he came into the room, and she was kneeling on the floor, wrenching open the little crate in which the cupid was packed. She must have glanced up at him, and smiled. "Look, Max," she would have said, "look what we've been sent." And she then would have plunged her hand down into the shavings and brought out the cupid who stood on one foot, his bow in his hand.
