<div class="line_en">Captain Gregory of the Missing Persons Bureau looked heavily out of his office window at the barred upper floor of the Hall of Justice, white and clean after the rain. Then he turned ponderously in his swivel chair and tamped his pipe with a heat-scarred thumb and stared at me bleakly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="雨后，法院大楼洁白明净，失踪人口调查局的格里高利上尉从装有栅栏的二楼办公室的窗户里忧郁地向外张望着。他坐在转椅上笨拙地转来转去，用带有烫伤疤痕的大拇指摁着烟丝，冷峻地盯着我。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Brother, I sit here all day on my fanny and I don't look as if I had a brain in my head. But you'd be surprised what I hear. Shooting this Canino was all right I guess, but I don't figure the homicide boys pinned any medals on you."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Maybe I knew," he said. "Maybe I thought if Eddie and his woman wanted to play a little game like that, it would be smart -- or as smart as I ever get -- to let them think they were getting away with it.

<div class="line_en">He raised his eyebrows as if raising them was an effort, a trick he was out of practice on. It furrowed his whole forehead and when it smoothed out it was full of white lines that turned reddish as I watched them.</div>

That's mainly why I asked you to come in this morning. I'd like you to believe that. Being a copper I like to see the law win. I'd like to see the flashy well-dressed muggs like Eddie Mars spoiling their manicures in the rock quarry at Folsom, alongside of the poor little slum-bred hard guys that got knocked over on their first caper and never had a break since. That's what I'd like. You and me both lived too long to think I'm likely to see it happen. Not in this town, not in any town half this size, in any part of this wide, green and beautiful U. S. A. We just don't run our country that way."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我是个警察，”他说，“只是个普通的警察。人还算正直。在一个丧失了格调的世界里，你也只能期盼一个人保持这么点正直了。今天早上我叫你过来，主要就是因为这个。我想让你相信：身为警察，我希望看到法律获得胜利。我希望看到艾迪·马尔斯那种衣冠禽兽被关进福尔森监狱，在采石场里弄断手指甲，还有那些在贫民窟长大的穷苦恶汉，犯过一次事蹲了大牢，从此可以改过自新。这些是我希望看到的。你我都活了太久，久到不相信这样的景象有朝一日会出现在我面前。不会出现在这座城市，不会出现在面积只有它一半大小的任何城市，不会出现在这广阔、青葱而美丽的国家的任何地方。因为我们根本不是这样治理国家的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"But that don't mean I think Eddie Mars bumped off Regan or had any reason to or would have done it if he had. I just figured maybe he knows something about it, and maybe sooner or later something will sneak out into the open. Hiding his wife out at Realito was childish, but it's the kind of childishness a smart monkey thinks is smart. I had him in here last night, after the D. A. got through with him. He admitted the whole thing. He said he knew Canino as a reliable protection guy and that's what he had him for. He didn't know anything about his hobbies or want to. He didn't know Harry Jones. He didn't know Joe Brody. He did know Geiger, of course, but claims he didn't know about his racket. I guess you heard all that."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“但这并不是说我认为艾迪·马尔斯弄死了里根，或者他有任何这么做的理由，退一步讲，就算他有理由，也不见得会这么做。我只是觉得他知道一些相关的事情，而这些事情迟早会大白于天下。把他妻子藏在里阿利特很幼稚，但一个爱耍滑头的家伙会把这种幼稚视作聪明。昨晚地方检察官问完他话之后，我把他叫到了这里。他对一切供认不讳。他说他认识的卡尼诺就是个可靠的保镖，所以他才雇用他。他不了解他的兴趣爱好，也不想去了解。他不认识哈利·琼斯。他不认识乔·布罗迪。他当然认识盖革，但很肯定地说不了解他的生意。这些你大概都听过了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他把烟丝敲了出来，深沉地低头凝视着。“那姑娘怎么样了？”他头也不抬地问道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Swell," I said. "I was standing on various pieces of carpet most of the night, being balled out. Before that I got soaked to the skin and beaten up. I'm in perfect condition."</div>

<div class="line_en">I went down out of the City Hall and got my car from the parking lot and drove home to the Hobart Arms. I lay down on the bed with my coat off and stared at the ceiling and listened to the traffic sounds on the street outside and watched the sun move slowly across a corner of the ceiling. I tried to go to sleep, but sleep didn't come. I got up and took a drink, although it was the wrong time of day, and lay down again. I still couldn't go to sleep. My brain ticked like a clock. I sat up on the side of the bed and stuffed a pipe and said out loud:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我下楼走出法院，从停车场取了车回到了霍巴特大厦的家里。我脱了外套躺在床上凝望天花板，听着外面往来车辆的喧闹声，看着阳光慢慢移动过天花板一角。我努力想入睡，但就是睡不着。虽然不是一天里喝酒的时间，我还是起来喝了一杯，重新躺下。还是睡不着。我脑子里仿佛有个时钟在滴答作响。我在窗沿上坐起身，把烟丝填进烟斗，大声说道：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He nodded slowly. Then he shrugged. "I don't know what the hell I even said that for. Good luck, Marlowe. Drop around any time."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Thanks, Captain."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“谢谢，上尉。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The pipe tasted as bitter as lye. I put it aside and lay down again. My mind drifted through waves of false memory, in which I seemed to do the same thing over and over again, go to the same places, meet the same people, say the same words to them, over and over again, and yet each time it seemed real, like something actually happening, and for the first time. I was driving hard along the highway through the rain, with Silver-Wig in the corner of the car, saying nothing, so that by the time we reached Los Angeles we seemed to be utter strangers again. I was getting out at an all night drugstore and phoning Bernie Ohls that I had killed a man at Realito and was on my way over to Wilde's house with Eddie Mars' wife, who had seen me do it. I was pushing the car along the silent, rain-polished streets to Lafayette Park and up under the porte-cochere of Wilde's big frame house and the porch light was already on, Ohls having telephoned ahead that I was coming. I was in Wilde's study and he was behind his desk in a flowered dressing-gown and a tight hard face and a dappled cigar moved in his fingers and up to the bitter smile on his lips. Ohls was there and a slim gray scholarly man from the Sheriffs office who looked and talked more like a professor of economics than a cop. I was telling the story and they were listening quietly and Silver-Wig sat in a shadow with her hands folded in her lap, looking at nobody. There was a lot of telephoning. There were two men from the Homicide Bureau who looked at me as if I was some kind of strange beast escaped from a traveling circus. I was driving again, with one of them beside me, to the Fulwider Building. We were there in the room where Harry Jones was still in the chair behind the desk, the twisted stiffness of his dead face and the sour-sweet smell in the room. There was a medica1 examiner, very young and husky, with red bristles on his neck. There was a fingerprint man fussing around and I was telling him not to forget the latch of the transom. (He found Canino's thumb print on it, the only print the brown man had left to back up my story.)</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这斗烟抽起来苦得像碱水。我把烟斗放到一旁，重新躺下。我的思绪在虚假记忆的汪洋里漂荡，我好像在一遍又一遍做同样的事，去同样的地方，遇见同样的人，对他们说同样的话，一遍又一遍，可每一遍都像是真实的，仿佛真实发生过而且是初次发生一样。我在公路上开着车冒雨疾驰，银发套姑娘缩在角落里一言不发，所以等到达洛杉矶时我俩又变成彻底的陌生人了。我下车走进一家全天营业的杂货店，打电话给伯尼·奥尔斯说我在里阿利特杀了人，正在去王尔德家的路上，艾迪·马尔斯的妻子跟我在一起，她是目击者。我驶过寂静、被大雨洗刷得很明亮的一条条街道，到了拉法耶特公园，开进王尔德那座大木板房的停车门廊里。走廊的灯已经亮了，奥尔斯提前打过电话说我要来。我走入王尔德的书房，他穿着一件印花晨衣坐在书桌后面，脸色凝重，一根花斑雪茄一会儿在他指间转动，一会儿缓缓上升，送进他带着苦笑的嘴里。奥尔斯在场，有一个警察局长办公室派来的瘦子，他一身灰，学究气十足，模样和谈吐都像个经济学教授，不太像警察。我陈述着事情的来龙去脉，他们静静听着，银发套姑娘坐在幽暗处，双手交叠在大腿上，谁也不看。来了很多电话。还有两个重案组的人，他俩看我的样子就像我是从巡回马戏团里逃出来的某种怪兽。我又开车上路了，身旁坐着其中一个重案组的人，要去富尔怀德大厦。我们走进那房间的时候，哈利·琼斯还瘫坐在书桌后面的椅子上，死人脸上扭曲的僵硬表情和屋里酸甜的味道都没变。随行的有个验尸官，非常年轻、高大，面对这样的场面脖子上红色的汗毛根根竖起。还来了个取指纹的，看他忙成一团，我告诉他别忘了气窗上的窗闩。（他在上面发现了卡尼诺的指纹，那钟爱棕色的家伙就留下了这么一处指纹来证明我没有胡编。）">查看中文翻译</div>

Then the door opened and Eddie Mars came in and an abrupt smile flashed to his face when he saw Silver-Wig, and he said: "Hello, sugar," and she didn't look at him or answer him. Eddie Mars fresh and cheerful, in a dark business suit, with a fringed white scarf hanging outside his tweed overcoat. Then they were gone, everybody was gone out of the room but myself and Wilde, and Wilde was saying in a cold, angry voice: "This is the last time, Marlowe. The next fast one you pull I'll throw you to the lions, no matter whose heart it breaks."</div>

The sunlight was so bright that it danced. I got to the Sternwood place in twenty minutes and drove up under the arch at the side door. It was eleven-fifteen. The birds in the ornamental trees were crazy with song after the rain, the terraced lawns were as green as the Irish flag, and the whole estate looked as though it had been made about ten minutes before. I rang the bell. It was five days since I had rung it for the first time. It felt like a year.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="几分钟之后，诺里斯出来了，他也完全没有变。那双犀利的蓝眼睛同之前一样疏远，灰里透粉的皮肤看上去又健康又安详，他的动作似乎要比实际年龄年轻二十岁。反倒是我，感觉岁月不饶人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We went up the tiled staircase and turned the opposite way from Vivian's room. With each step the house seemed to grow larger and more silent. We reached a massive old door that looked as if it had come out of a church. Norris opened it softly and looked in. Then he stood aside and I went in past him across what seemed to be about a quarter of a mile of carpet to a huge canopied bed like the one Henry the Eighth died in.</div>

<div class="line_en">I said: "I was convinced you put those Geiger notes up to me chiefly as a test, and that you were a little afraid Regan might somehow be involved in an attempt to blackmail you. I didn't know anything about Regan then. It wasn't until I talked to Captain Gregory that I realized Regan wasn't that sort of guy in all probability."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我说：“我确信您把盖革写的那些纸条给我看主要是想试试我，你有点担心里根参与其中来勒索您。当时我还对里根一无所知。直到跟格里高利上尉谈过话，我才明白里根百分之百不是那种人。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That is scarcely answering my question."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这回答不了我刚才的问题吧？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I nodded. "No. That is scarcely answering your question. I guess I just don't like to admit that I played a hunch. The morning I was here, after I left you out in the orchid house, Mrs. Regan sent for me. She seemed to assume I was hired to look for her husband and she didn't seem to like it. She let drop however that 'they' had found his car in a certain garage. The 'they' could only be the police. Consequently the police must know something about it. If they did, the Missing Persons Bureau would be the department that would have the case. I didn't know whether you had reported it, of course, or somebody else, or whether they had found the car through somebody reporting it abandoned in a garage. But I know cops, and I knew that if they got that much, they would get a little more -- especially as your driver happened to have a police record. I didn't know how much more they would get. That started me thinking about the Missing Persons Bureau. What convinced me was something in Mr. Wilde's manner the night we had the conference over at his house about Geiger and so on. We were alone for a minute and he asked me whether you had told me you were looking for Regan. I said you had told me you wished you knew where he was and that he was all right. Wilde pulled his lip in and looked funny. I knew just as plainly as though he had said it that by 'looking for Regan' he meant using the machinery of the law to look for him. Even then I tried to go up against Captain Gregory in such a way that I wouldn't tell him anything he didn't know already."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我点点头。“是的。回答不了您刚才的问题。我可能只是不愿承认我在凭直觉办事。那天早上我在外面那间兰花暖房里见完您，里根太太把我叫去了她屋里。她好像认为您雇我是为了找她丈夫，她好像不太乐意。不过她透露了‘他们’在某间车库里找到了他的车。所谓‘他们’，只可能是指警察。所以警察肯定掌握了一些相关的情况。如果确实如此，那这案子就该归失踪人口调查局办。当然我不知道是不是您报的案，或者是别的什么人，或者他们究竟是不是因为有人报案才发现有辆车被遗弃在车库里。不过我熟悉警察，知道只要他们掌握这些情况，就会进一步有所了解——尤其因为您的司机恰好有前科。我不知道他们还能挖掘出多少情况。这启发我想到失踪人口调查局。那天晚上我同王尔德先生在他家详细谈到了盖革和一些别的事，他当时的举止令我相信自己的判断没错。我俩单独待过一分钟，他问我您是否对我说了您在寻找里根。我说您告诉过我您希望知道他的下落，他是否安然无恙。王尔德嘴唇一抿，样子有点奇怪。这么一来我就全明白了，好比他明确说，‘寻找里根’的意思是用警方的力量来寻找他。就算在那个时候，我还是尽力以‘不告诉他任何他还不知道的事情’这一原则同格里高利上尉接触。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Maybe you don't. The head of a Missing Persons Bureau isn't a talker. He wouldn't be in that office if he was. This one is a very smart cagey guy who tries, with a lot of success at first, to give the impression he's a middle-aged hack fed up with his job. The game I play is not spillikins. There's always a large element of bluff connected with it. Whatever I might say to a cop, he would be apt to discount it. And to that cop it wouldn't make much difference what I said. When you hire a boy in my line of work it isn't like hiring a window-washer and showing him eight windows and saying: 'Wash those and you're through.' You don't know what I have to go through or over or under to do your job for you. I do it my way. I do my best to protect you and I may break a few rules, but I break them in your favor. The client comes first, unless he's crooked. Even then all I do is hand the job back to him and keep my mouth shut. After all you didn't tell me not to go to Captain Gregory."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, what have I done wrong? Your man Norris seemed to think when Geiger was eliminated the case was over. I don't see it that way. Geiger's method of approach puzzled me and still does. I'm not Sherlock Holmes or Philo Vance. I don't expect to go over ground the police have covered and pick up a broken pen point and build a case from it. If you think there is anybody in the detective business making a living doing that sort of thing, you don't know much about cops. It's not things like that they overlook, if they overlook anything. I'm not saying they often overlook anything when they're really allowed to work. But if they do, it's apt to be something looser and vaguer, like a man of Geiger's type sending you his evidence of debt and asking you to pay like a gentleman -- Geiger, a man in a shady racket, in a vulnerable position, protected by a racketeer and having at least some negative protection from some of the police. Why did he do that? Because he wanted to find out if there was anything putting pressure on you. If there was, you would pay him. If not, you would ignore him and wait for his next move. But there was something putting a pressure on you. Regan. You were afraid he was not what he had appeared to be, that he had stayed around and been nice to you just long enough to find out how to play games with your bank account."</div>
