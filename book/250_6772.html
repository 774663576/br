<div class="line_en">In 1886 a young woman was living in a modest house near a secluded New England village, with no company but a little boy about five years old. She did her own work, she discouraged acquaintanceships, and had none. The butcher, the baker, and the others that served her could tell the villagers nothing about her further than that her name was Stillman, and that she called the child Archy. Whence she came they had not been able to find out, but they said she talked like a Southerner. The child had no playmates and no comrade, and no teacher but the mother. She taught him diligently and intelligently, and was satisfied with the results; even a little proud of them. One day Archy said,</div>

She went on with her tests; with a candle she traversed the house from garret to cellar, hiding pins, needles, thimbles, spools, under pillows, under carpets, in cracks in the walls, under the coal in the bin; then sent the little fellow in the dark to find them; which he did, and was happy and proud when she praised him and smothered him with caresses.</div>

Yet they lit up her face; lit it with a fell light of their own; lit it with vague fires of hell. She was in a fever of unrest; she could not sit, stand, read, sew; there was no relief for her but in movement. She tested her boys gift in twenty ways, and kept saying to herself all the time, with her mind in the past: "He broke my fathers heart, and night and day all these years I have tried, and all in vain, to think out a way to break his. I have found it now; I have found it now."</div>

<div class="line_en">The years drifted on. Archy was become a handsome, shapely, athletic youth, courteous, dignified, companionable, pleasant in his ways, and looking perhaps a trifle older than he was, which was sixteen. One evening his mother said she had something of grave importance to say to him, adding that he was old enough to hear it now, and old enough and possessed of character enough and stability enough to carry out a stern plan which she had been for years contriving and maturing. Then she told him her bitter story, in all its naked atrociousness. For a while the boy was paralyzed; then he said:</div>

<div class="line_en">From this time forward life took on a new complexion for her. She said, "The future is secure; I can wait, and enjoy the waiting." The most of her lost interests revived. She took up music again, and languages, drawing, painting, and the other long-discarded delights of her maidenhood. She was happy once more, and felt again the zest of life. As the years drifted by she watched the development of her boy, and was contented with it. Not altogether, but nearly that. The soft side of his heart was larger than the other side of it. It was his only defect, in her eyes. But she considered that his love for her and worship of her made up for it. He was a good hater; that was well; but it was a question if the materials of his hatreds were of as tough and enduring a quality as those of his friendships; and that was not so well.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从这时起，她的生活翻开了新的一页。她说，“今后的日子有了保证，我能等，我要高高兴兴地等著。”她重新拣起了放弃多时的爱好，重操音乐、语言、素描、绘画，以及久违了的少女时代的赏心乐事。她又快乐起来，重新体味生活的情趣。年复一年，她看著自己的孩子慢慢长大，很知足。虽然不能说心满意足，倒也差不了许多。在孩子的心田里，善良的一面压过了其他方面。在她看来，这是他惟一的缺陷。不过，她认为孩子对她的挚爱和孝敬弥补了这个缺陷。‘他的仇恨不掩善良固然是好事；可是，他的仇恨能否像他的友善一样执著而持久，还是一个问题——这就不妙了。">查看中文翻译</div>

You will drive him from that place; you will hunt him down and drive him again; and yet again, and again, and again, persistently, relentlessly, poisoning his life, filling it with mysterious terrors, loading it with weariness and misery, making him wish for death, and that he had a suicides courage; you will make of him another wandering Jew; he shall know no rest any more, no peace of mind, no placid sleep; you shall shadow him, cling to him, persecute him, till you break his heart, as he broke my fathers and mine."</div>
