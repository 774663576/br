<div class="line_en">Walking through the halls that morning on my way to the lockers was, I have to say, absolutely awesome. Everything was different now. I was different. Where I usually walked with my head down, trying to avoid being seen, today I walked with my head up, looking around. I wanted to be seen. One kid wearing the same exact costume as mine, long white skull face oozing fake red blood, high-fived me as we passed each other on the stairs. I have no idea who he was, and he had no idea who I was, and I wondered for a second if he would have ever done that if he'd known it was me under the mask.</div>

<div class="line_en">I was starting to think this was going to go down as one of the most awesome days in the history of my life, but then I got to homeroom. The first costume I saw as I walked inside the door was Darth Sidious. It had one of the rubber masks that are so realistic, with a big black hood over the head and a long black robe. I knew right away it was Julian, of course. He must have changed his costume at the last minute because he thought I was coming as Jango Fett. He was talking to two mummies who must have been Miles and Henry, and they were all kind of looking at the door like they were waiting for someone to come through it. I knew it wasn't a Bleeding Scream they were looking for. It was a Boba Fett.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我预感这将是我有生以来最棒的一天，但是这时，我来到了年级室。我进门看到的第一身行头是达斯·西迪厄斯。他的橡胶面具几可乱真，黑色面罩罩头，一袭黑色的长披风。我马上反应过来，这一定是朱利安。他肯定是在最后一刻改变了主意，因为他以为我要扮成波巴·费特。他正在跟两个“木乃伊”说话——一定是迈尔斯和亨利，他们一直朝门口张望，好像在等什么人进来。我知道他们等的不是骷髅幽灵，而是波巴·费特。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I was going to go and sit at my usual desk, but for some reason, I don't know why, I found myself walking over to a desk near them, and I could hear them talking.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="一个“木乃伊”说：“看起来真的很像他。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Like this part especially…," answered Julian's voice. He put his fingers on the cheeks and eyes of his Darth Sidious mask.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这部分尤其像……”朱利安的声音回答道。他用手指了指脸颊和达斯·西迪厄斯面具上的眼睛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Actually," said the mummy, "what he really looks like is one of those shrunken heads. Have you ever seen those? He looks exactly like that."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“其实，”木乃伊说，“真正像的是干瘪的脑袋。你们看见了吗？他看起来跟那一模一样。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"If I looked like that," said the Julian voice, kind of laughing, "I swear to God, I'd put a hood over my face every day."</div>

<div class="line_en">The mummy shrugged. I knew the shrug, of course. I knew the voice. I knew I wanted to run out of the class right then and there. But I stood where I was and listened to Jack Will finish what he was saying. "I mean, the thing is: he always follows me around. What am I supposed to do?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="木乃伊耸了耸肩。我当然熟悉这耸肩的动作。我熟悉这个声音。我真想马上跑出教室，但是我待在原地，想听杰克·威尔把话说完。“我的意思是，问题在于，他总是鞍前马后地跟着我。那我该怎么办？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Then why do you hang out with him so much?" asked Darth Sidious.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那你为什么整天跟他待在一起？”达斯·西迪厄斯问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I don't know," answered the mummy. "Tushman asked me to hang out with him at the beginning of the year, and he must have told all the teachers to put us next to each other in all our classes, or something."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不知道，”木乃伊答道，“图什曼叫我开学的时候多跟他在一起，他一定也跟所有老师打了招呼，叫他们在所有课上把我们俩安排在一起坐什么的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Just ditch him," said Julian.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“甩掉他！”朱利安说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I don't know what Jack answered because I walked out of the class without anyone knowing I had been there. My face felt like it was on fire while I walked back down the stairs. I was sweating under my costume. And I started crying. I couldn't keep it from happening. The tears were so thick in my eyes I could barely see, but I couldn't wipe them through the mask as I walked. I was looking for a little tiny spot to disappear into. I wanted a hole I could fall inside of: a little black hole that would eat me up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我不知道杰克是怎么回答的，因为我从教室走了出去，没有人知道我曾经来过。下楼的时候，我感觉脸上火辣辣的，汗水湿透了我的衣服。我哭了出来。我简直无能为力。我泪如泉涌，什么也看不见，但是我戴着面具走路，无法擦眼泪。我在寻找一个可以藏身的小地方。我想掉进一个洞：一个可以吃掉我的小小黑洞。">查看中文翻译</div>
