<div class="line_en">During three days the couple walked upon air, with their heads in the clouds. They were but vaguely conscious of their surroundings; they saw all things dimly, as through a veil; they were steeped in dreams, often they did not hear when they were spoken to; they often did not understand when they heard; they answered confusedly or at random; Sally sold molasses by weight, sugar by the yard, and furnished soap when asked for candles, and Aleck put the cat in the wash and fed milk to the soiled linen. Everybody was stunned and amazed, and went about muttering, "What CAN be the matter with the Fosters?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Three days. Then came events! Things had taken a happy turn, and for forty-eight hours Aleck's imaginary corner had been booming. Up -- up -- still up! Cost point was passed. Still up -- and up -- and up! Cost point was passed. STill up -- and up -- and up! Five points above cost -- then ten -- fifteen -- twenty! Twenty points cold profit on the vast venture, now, and Aleck's imaginary brokers were shouting frantically by imaginary long-distance, "Sell! sell! for Heaven's sake SELL!"</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a fatal resolve. The very next day came the historic crash, the record crash, the devastating crash, when the bottom fell out of Wall Street, and the whole body of gilt-edged stocks dropped ninety-five points in five hours, and the multimillionaire was seen begging his bread in the Bowery. Aleck sternly held her grip and "put up" as long as she could, but at last there came a call which she was powerless to meet, and her imaginary brokers sold her out. Then, and not till then, the man in her was vanished, and the woman in her resumed sway. She put her arms about her husband's neck and wept, saying:</div>

<div class="line_en">"Bear up, my Aleck, all is not lost! You really never invested a penny of my uncle's bequest, but only its unmaterialized future; what we have lost was only the incremented harvest from that future by your incomparable financial judgment and sagacity. Cheer up, banish these griefs; we still have the thirty thousand untouched; and with the experience which you have acquired, think what you will be able to do with it in a couple years! The marriages are not off, they are only postponed."</div>

<div class="line_en">A bitter reproach was on Sally's tongue: "I BEGGED you to sell, but you --" He did not say it; he had not the heart to add a hurt to that broken and repentant spirit. A nobler thought came to him and he said:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尖刻的责难涌到了萨利嘴边，他想说：“我求你抛，可是你——”他没有说出口；他不想在追悔莫及的艾莱柯那颗破碎的心上再捅一刀。他想到了一个比较高尚的念头，说：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">These are blessed words. Aleck saw how true they were, and their influence was electric; her tears ceased to flow, and her great spirit rose to its full stature again. With flashing eye and grateful heart, and with hand uplifted in pledge and prophecy, she said:</div>

<div class="line_en">But she was interrupted by a visitor. It was the editor and proprietor of the SAGAMORE. He had happened into Lakeside to pay a duty-call upon an obscure grandmother of his who was nearing the end of her pilgrimage, and with the idea of combining business with grief he had looked up the Fosters, who had been so absorbed in other things for the past four years that they neglected to pay up their subscription. Six dollars due. No visitor could have been more welcome. He would know all about Uncle Tilbury and what his chances might be getting to be, cemeterywards. They could, of course, ask no questions, for that would squelch the bequest, but they could nibble around on the edge of the subject and hope for results. The scheme did not work. The obtuse editor did not know he was being nibbled at; but at last, chance accomplished what art had failed in. In illustration of something under discussion which required the help of metaphor, the editor said:</div>

<div class="line_en">Then they stirred, and lifted their heads wearily, and gazed at each other wistfully, dreamily, dazed; then presently began to twaddle to each other in a wandering and childish way. At intervals they lapsed into silences, leaving a sentence unfinished, seemingly either unaware of it or losing their way. Sometimes, when they woke out of these silences they had a dim and transient consciousness that something had happened to their minds; then with a dumb and yearning solicitude they would softly caress each other's hands in mutual compassion and support, as if they would say: "I am near you, I will not forsake you, we will bear it together; somewhere there is release and forgetfulness, somewhere there is a grave and peace; be patient, it will not be long."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="后来他们摇晃了一下，精疲力尽地抬起头来，若有所思地相互盯着，如梦如痴，心神恍惚，接着又像小孩子似的颠三倒四说胡话。他们常常只说半句话，就不出声了，看来不是没意识到，就是想不起该说什么。有时候他们从沉默中苏醒过来，闪过一种模模糊糊的感觉：他们的脑袋里想过什么事；然后，他们带着无言的关怀，轻轻拉住彼此的手，表达相互的同情和支持，好像是说：“我就在你身旁，我不会撤下你，咱们一起承受；总会解脱出来，忘了这些，总有一块墓地可以安息；忍着吧，用不了多久了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, I should say! I was one of the executors. He hadn't anything to leave but a wheelbarrow, and he left that to me. It hadn't any wheel, and wasn't any good. Still, it was something, and so, to square up, I scribbled off a sort of a little obituarial send-off for him, but it got crowded out."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嘿，那还用说！我是遗嘱执行者之一。他什么都没撇下，只有一架小推车留给我了。那车还没有轮子，没什么用处。不过总算是件东西吧，为了报答他，我给他凑了几句悼词，可又让别的稿子挤掉了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
