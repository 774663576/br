<div class="line_en">Most terribly cold it was; it snowed, and was nearly quite dark, and evening-the last evening of the year. In this cold and darkness there went along the street a poor little girl, bareheaded, and with naked feet. When she left home she had slippers on, it is true; but what was the good of that? They were very large slippers, which her mother had hitherto worn; so large were they; and the poor little thing lost them as she scuffled away across the street, because of two carriages that rolled by dreadfully fast.</div>

<div class="line_en">One slipper was nowhere to be found; the other had been laid hold of by an urchin, and off he ran with it; he thought it would do capitally for a cradle when he some day or other should have children himself. So the little maiden walked on with her tiny naked feet, that were quite red and blue from cold. She carried a quantity of matches in an old apron, and she held a bundle of them in her hand. Nobody had bought anything of her the whole livelong day; no one had given her a single farthing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有一只她怎样也寻不到，另一只又被一个男孩子捡起来，拿着逃走了。男孩子还说，等他将来有孩子的时候，可以把它当做一个摇篮来使用。现在小姑娘只好赤着一双小脚走。小脚已经冻得发红发青了。她有许多火柴包在一个旧围裙里；她手中还拿着一扎。这一整天谁也没有向她买过一根；谁也没有给她一个铜板。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In a corner formed by two houses, of which one advanced more than the other, she seated herself down and cowered together. Her little feet she had drawn close up to her, but she grew colder and colder, and to go home she did not venture, for she had not sold any matches and could not bring a farthing of money: from her father she would certainly get blows, and at home it was cold too, for above her she had only the roof, through which the wind whistled, even though the largest cracks were stopped up with straw and rags.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那儿有两座房子，其中一座房子比另一座更向街心伸出一点，她便在这个墙角里坐下来，缩作一团。她把一双小脚也缩进来，不过她感到更冷。她不敢回家里去，因为她没有卖掉一根火柴，没有赚到一个铜板。她的父亲一定会打她，而且家里也是很冷的，因为他们头上只有一个可以灌进风来的屋顶，虽然最大的裂口已经用草和破布堵住了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Her little hands were almost numbed with cold. Oh! a match might afford her a world of comfort, if she only dared take a single one out of the bundle, draw it against the wall, and warm her fingers by it. She drew one out. "Rischt!" how it blazed, how it burnt! It was a warm, bright flame, like a candle, as she held her hands over it: it was a wonderful light. It seemed really to the little maiden as though she were sitting before a large iron stove, with burnished brass feet and a brass ornament at top. The fire burned with such blessed influence; it warmed so delightfully. The little girl had already stretched out her feet to warm them too; but-the small flame went out, the stove vanished: she had only the remains of the burnt-out match in her hand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她的一双小手几乎冻僵了。唉！哪怕一根小火柴对她也是有好处的。只要她敢抽出一根来，在墙上擦着了，就可以暖暖手！最后她抽出一根来了。哧！它燃起来了，冒出火光来了！当她把手覆在上面的时候，它便变成了一朵温暖、光明的火焰，像是一根小小的蜡烛。这是一道美丽的小光！小姑娘觉得真像坐在一个铁火炉旁边一样：它有光亮的黄铜圆捏手和黄铜炉身，火烧得那么欢，那么暖，那么美！唉，这是怎么一回事儿？当小姑娘刚刚伸出一双脚，打算暖一暖脚的时候，火焰就忽然熄灭了！火炉也不见了。她坐在那儿，手中只有烧过了的火柴。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The flakes of snow covered her long fair hair, which fell in beautiful curls around her neck; but of that, of course, she never once now thought. From all the windows the candles were gleaming, and it smelt so deliciously of roast goose, for you know it was New Year's Eve; yes, of that she thought.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="雪花落到她金黄的长头发上——它卷曲地散落在她的肩上，看上去非常美丽。不过她并没有想到自己漂亮。所有的窗子都射出光来，街上飘着一股烤鹅肉的香味。的确，这是除夕。她在想这件事情。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Thousands of lights were burning on the green branches, and gaily-colored pictures, such as she had seen in the shop-windows, looked down upon her. The little maiden stretched out her hands towards them when-the match went out. The lights of the Christmas tree rose higher and higher, she saw them now as stars in heaven; one fell down and formed a long trail of fire.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="它的绿枝上燃着几千支蜡烛；彩色的图画，跟橱窗里挂着的那些一样美丽，在向她眨眼。这个小姑娘把两只手伸过去。于是火柴就熄灭了。圣诞节的烛光越升越高。她看到它们现在变成了明亮的星星。这些星星有一颗落下来了，在天上划出一条长长的光线。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She rubbed another against the wall: it burned brightly, and where the light fell on the wall, there the wall became transparent like a veil, so that she could see into the room. On the table was spread a snow-white tablecloth; upon it was a splendid porcelain service, and the roast goose was steaming famously with its stuffing of apple and dried plums. And what was still more capital to behold was, the goose hopped down from the dish, reeled about on the floor with knife and fork in its breast, till it came up to the poor little girl; when-the match went out and nothing but the thick, cold, damp wall was left behind. She lighted another match. Now there she was sitting under the most magnificent Christmas tree: it was still larger, and more decorated than the one which she had seen through the glass door in the rich merchant's house.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她又擦了一根。它燃起来了，发出光来了。墙上有亮光照着的那块地方，现在变得透明，像一片薄纱；她可以看到房间里的东西：桌上铺着雪白的台布，上面有精致的碗盘，填满了梅子和苹果的、冒着香气的烤鹅。更美妙的事情是：这只鹅从盘子里跳出来了，背上插着刀叉，蹒跚地在地上走着，一直向这个穷苦的小姑娘面前走来。这时火柴就熄灭了；她面前只有一堵又厚又冷的墙。她点了另一根火柴。现在她是坐在美丽的圣诞树下面。上次圣诞节时，她透过玻璃门，看到一个富有商人家里的一株圣诞树；可是现在这一株比那株还要大，还要美。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Grandmother!" cried the little one. "Oh, take me with you! You go away when the match burns out; you vanish like the warm stove, like the delicious roast goose, and like the magnificent Christmas tree!" And she rubbed the whole bundle of matches quickly against the wall, for she wanted to be quite sure of keeping her grandmother near her. And the matches gave such a brilliant light that it was brighter than at noon-day: never formerly had the grandmother been so beautiful and so tall. She took the little maiden, on her arm, and both flew in brightness and in joy so high, so very high, and then above was neither cold, nor hunger, nor anxiety-they were with God.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“祖母！”小姑娘叫起来。“啊！请把我带走吧！我知道，这火柴一灭掉，你就会不见了，你就会像那个温暖的火炉、那只美丽的烤鹅、那棵幸福的圣诞树一样地不见了！”于是她急忙把整束火柴中剩下的火柴都擦亮了，因为她非常想把祖母留住。这些火柴发出强烈的光芒，照得比大白天还要明朗。祖母从来没有像现在这样显得美丽和高大。她把小姑娘抱起来，搂到怀里。她们两人在光明和快乐中飞走了，越飞越高，飞到既没有寒冷，也没有饥饿，也没有忧愁的那块地方——她们是跟上帝在一起。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She drew another match against the wall: it was again light, and in the lustre there stood the old grandmother, so bright and radiant, so mild, and with such an expression of love.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她在墙上又擦了一根火柴。它把四周都照亮了；在这光亮中老祖母出现了。她显得那么光明，那么温柔，那么和蔼。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Someone is just dead!" said the little girl; for her old grandmother, the only person who had loved her, and who was now no more, had told her, that when a star falls, a soul ascends to God.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“现在又有一个什么人死去了，”小姑娘说，因为她的老祖母曾经说过：天上落下一颗星，地上就有一个灵魂升到了上帝那儿去。老祖母是唯一对她好的人，但是现在已经死了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But in the corner, at the cold hour of dawn, sat the poor girl, with rosy cheeks and with a smiling mouth, leaning against the wall-frozen to death on the last evening of the old year. Stiff and stark sat the child there with her matches, of which one bundle had been burnt. "She wanted to warm herself," people said. No one had the slightest suspicion of what beautiful things she had seen; no one even dreamed of the splendor in which, with her grandmother she had entered on the joys of a new year.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过在一个寒冷的早晨，这个小姑娘却坐在一个墙角里；她的双颊通红，嘴唇发出微笑，她已经死了——在旧年的除夕冻死了。新年的太阳升起来了，照着她小小的尸体！她坐在那儿，手中还捏着火柴——其中有一扎差不多都烧光了。“她想把自己暖和一下，”人们说。谁也不知道：她曾经看到过多么美丽的东西，她曾经是多么光荣地跟祖母一起，走到新年的幸福中去。">查看中文翻译</div>
