<div class="line_en">Jean had wept before, but she was not weeping now. The island lay golden in the heartless, unfeeling sunlight as the ship came slowly into sight above the twin peaks of Sparta. On that rocky island, not long ago, her son had escaped death by a miracle she now understood all too well. Sometimes she wondered if it might not have been better had the Overlords stood aside and left him to his fate. Death was something she could face as she had faced it before: it was in the natural order of things. But this was stranger than death -- and more final. Until this day, men had died, yet the race had continued.</div>

<div class="line_en">There was no sound or movement from the children. They stood in scattered groups along the sand, showing no more interest in one another than in the homes they were leaving forever. Many carried babies who were too small to walk -- or who did not wish to assert the powers that made walking unnecessary. For surely, thought George, if they could move inanimate matter, they could move their own bodies. Why, indeed, were the Overlord ships collecting them at all?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="孩子们一动不动地站在沙滩上，既没有对家的留念，也没有和其他小伙伴谈话的兴致。一些孩子由父母抱着，他们要么不会走路，要么不愿意走。乔治想，他们既然能够移动家中的各类物品，理应能够移动自己的身体。外星人为什么要把他们集合起来运走呢？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was of no importance. They were leaving, and this was the way they chose to go. Then George realized what it was that had been teasing his memory. Somewhere, long ago, he had seen a century -- old newsreel of such an exodus. It must have been at the beginning of the First World War -- or the Second. There had been long lines of trains, crowded with children, pulling slowly out of the threatened cities, leaving behind the parents that so many of them would never see again. Few were crying: some were puzzled, clutching nervously at their small belongings, but most seemed to be looking forward with eagerness to some great adventure.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="怎么想并不重要，孩子们就要走了，而且他们也愿意离开，就像以前看到过的一幅百年老照片上的情景。那还是一战或二战开始的时候，一列列火车载着挤得满满的孩子，缓缓驶离危险的城市，孩子的父母留下了，对于很多孩子来说，这就是和父母的生离死别了。但几乎没有一个孩子哭，少数孩子只是神情茫然地紧攥着小包袱，大多数孩子则是副急不可耐的兴奋表情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And yet -- the analogy was false. History never repeated itself. These who were leaving now were no longer children, whatever they might be. And this time there would be no reunion.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，这样的类比并不恰当，历史不会重演。这次离开的将不再是人类的孩子，没有人知道他们会变成什么。这次注定了是永别。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The ship had grounded along the water's edge, sinking deeply into the soft sand. In perfect unison, the line of great curving panels slid upwards and the gangways extended themselves towards the beach like metal tongues. The scattered, unutterably lonely figures began to converge, to gather into a crowd that moved precisely as a human crowd might do.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="飞船顺着海岸着陆了，船身深深地陷进软绵绵的沙里。弧形的船舱壁刚刚升起，舷梯就像一只只巨大的金属舌头伸出来，降落到沙滩上。孩子们集合起来朝那边走去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Look," she whispered. "I can see Jeff. By that second door."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“看，”她说，“我看见杰弗了，在第二个门那里。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was a long way away, and very hard to be certain. There was a mist before his eyes which made it hard to see. But it was Jeff -- he was sure of that: George could recognize his son now, as he stood with one foot already on the metal gangway.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="距离很远，再加上眼里含着泪，乔治无法看得很清楚，但那确实是儿子杰弗，他的一只脚已经踏上舷梯。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Lonely? Why had he thought that, wondered George. For that was the one thing they could never be again. Only individuals can be lonely -- only human beings. When the barriers were down at last, loneliness would vanish as personality faded. The countless raindrops would have merged into the ocean.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们会孤独吗？乔治不知道为什么突然冒出了这样的想法。他们不可能孤独，只有单个的人才感到孤独，他们已经变成了一个独立的新个体，就像无数雨点汇成大海，孤独感自然消失了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He felt Jean's hand increase its pressure on his in a sudden spasm of emotion.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他突然感到简握紧了他的手。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And Jeff turned and looked back. His face was only a white blur: at this distance, there was no way of telling if it bore any hint of recognition, any remembrance for all that he was leaving behind. Nor would George ever know if Jeff had turned towards them by pure chance -- or if he knew, in those last moments while he was still their son, that they stood watching him as he passed into the land that they could never enter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杰弗回头望着。距离太远，他的脸很模糊，看不出脸上的神情，也不知道他是否记起了这个地方。也许他只是碰巧把头掉了过来，也许在这最后关头他记起了自己的父母，知道他们正目送自己离去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">No one was supposed to know when the time would be. Yet Jean awoke in the stillness of the night, and lay for a moment staring at the ghostly glimmer from the ceiling. Then she reached out to grasp George's hand. He was a sound sleeper, but this time he woke at once. They did not speak, for the words that were wanted did not exist.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不知什么时候，简突然醒过来，四周寂静无声。她望着屋顶投下来的月光，突然抓住乔治的手，乔治平时总是睡得很沉，这次却马上醒了。他们没有说话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For those who were left there were many roads but only one destination. There were some who said: "The world is still beautiful: one day we must leave it, but why should we hasten our departure?"</div>

<div class="line_en">It was thus with Athens. The island had been born in fire; in fire it chose to die. Those who wished to leave did so, but most remained, to meet the end amid the broken fragments of their dreams.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="新雅典也是这样，想走的人都走了，绝大多数人留了下来，在残梦中等待自己的未来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But others, who had set more store by the future than the past, and had lost all that made life worth living, did not wish to stay. They took their leave alone, or with their friends, according to their nature.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="另一些人则把未来看得更重，生活已经失去了应有的意义，他们要么独自自杀，要么结伴自杀。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The great doors began to close. And in that moment Fey lifted up her muzzle and gave a low, desolate moan. She turned her beautiful limpid eyes towards George, and he knew that she had lost her master. He had no rival now.</div>

<div class="line_en">Still without a word, George followed her through the silent house. They went across the patch of moonlight that had entered through the studio roof, moving as quietly as the shadows it cast, until they came to the deserted nursery.</div>

<div class="line_en">Jean was no longer frightened, or even sad. She had come through to the calm waters and was beyond emotion now. But there was one thing still to be done, and she knew that there was barely time to do it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="简不再害怕，甚至也不伤心了，经历了这么多事，她在感情上已经超脱了，但还有一件事必须马上做，否则时间就来不及了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She had left her toys behind, thought George, but ours go hence with us. He thought of the royal children of the Pharaohs, whose dolls and beads had been buried with them five thousand years ago. So it would be again. No one else, he told himself will ever love our treasures: we will take them with us, and will not part with them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="乔治想，她没有带上自己的玩具，我们要替她永远带着。五千年前，法老的孩子死了，他们的玩具娃娃和珠子都会和他们葬在一起，现在也该是这样，除了我们自己谁也不会在乎这些宝贝，我们要永远带着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Nothing had been changed. The fluoro-patterns that George had painted so carefully still glowed on the walls. And the rattle that had once belonged to Jennifer Anne still lay where she had dropped it, when her mind turned into the unknowable remoteness it inhabited now.</div>

<div class="line_en">Slowly Jean turned towards him, and rested her head upon his shoulder. He clasped his arms about her waist, and the love he had once known came back to him, faint yet clear, like an echo from a distant range of hills. It was too late now to say all that was due to her, and the regrets he felt were less for his deceits than for his past indifference.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="简慢慢地转过身，把头靠在乔治的肩上。乔治揽着她的腰，那种熟悉的爱意又回来了，淡淡的，却很分明，就像远处山脉传来的回声。现在已经来不及讲温柔的话了，他悔恨自己的不忠，更懊悔自己太冷漠。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then Jean said quietly: "Goodbye, my darling" and tightened her arms about him. There was no time for George to answer, but even at that final moment he felt a brief astonishment as he wondered how she knew that the moment had arrived.</div>
