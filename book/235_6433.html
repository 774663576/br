<div class="line_en">"You're going to be good?" said Lord Henry. "Don't tell me that. You're wonderful as you are. Please don't change." His long, white fingers played with a flower on the table. It was spring in London, and the two friends were having dinner at Lord Henry's house.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I've no idea," answered Lord Henry. "The English police report that Basil went to Paris on the midnight train on the ninth of November, but the French police say that he never arrived in Paris at all. If Basil wants to hide himself, I really don't care. And if he's dead, I don't want to think about him. Death is the only thing that really frightens me -- I hate it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不知道。”亨利勋爵回答。“英国警方说巴兹尔于11月9日乘午夜的火车去了巴黎，可是法国警方说他根本就没抵达巴黎。如果巴兹尔想隐藏起来，我真的不在乎。如果他死了，我不想再想他。死是唯一让我害怕的事情——我恨死亡。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Lord Henry smiled. "No, my dear Dorian, murder wouldn't please you. You like a different kind of pleasure. And you should never do anything that you cannot talk about after dinner." He lifted his coffee cup. "What happened to the fine portrait that Basil painted of you? I haven't seen it for years. Didn't you tell me that it was stolen? What a pity!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="亨利勋爵一笑。“不，亲爱的多里安，杀人不会让你高兴，你喜欢与这不同的快乐，而且你决不会做晚饭后你不能谈论的事情。”他端起咖啡：“巴兹尔给你画的那幅精美画像怎么样了？我好多年没看见它了。你是不是告诉过我画像被偷了？多可惜啊！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For a while the two men were silent. Then the older man lay back in his chair and looked at Dorian with half-closed eyes. "Tell me how you have kept your youth and your wonderful beauty, Dorian. You must have some secret. I'm only ten years older than you, and I look like an old man. But you haven't changed since the day when I first met you. What a wonderful life you've had!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有一会儿两个人都没说话。过后年长些的那位靠在椅背上，用半睁的眼睛看着多里安。“告诉我你是怎么保持青春和美貌的，多里安。你一定有个秘密。我只比你大10岁，却看起来像个老人。可从我看见你的第一天起，你一点也没变，你的生活太妙了！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Why had he ever made that wish about the picture? He had kept his youth and beauty, but he had paid a terrible price for it. His beauty had destroyed his soul. He picked up a mirror and stared at his face. What was he now? A face without a heart. Suddenly he hated his own beauty, and dropped the mirror on the floor where it broke into many small pieces.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他为什么对画像许了那个愿？他保住了青春和美貌，但却为此付出了可怕的代价。他的美貌毁了他的灵魂。他拿起一面镜子看着自己的脸。他现在成了什么？一张没有心的脸。突然他恨自己的美貌，便把镜子扔在地上，摔成了碎片。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He went quietly upstairs to the locked room. Yes, he would live a good life, and he need not be afraid any more of the evil face of his soul. But when he uncovered the picture, he gave a cry of pain. There was no change. The face in the picture was still terrible -- more hateful, if possible, than before -- and the red on the hand seemed brighter, like new blood.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他快步上楼奔向那间锁着的房间。是的，他要过好人的生活，他再不必害怕他灵魂的那张邪恶的脸了。但当他掀开画像，他痛苦地喊出了声。没有变化。画像的脸依旧可怕——可能比以前更可憎——手上的红色似乎更鲜亮，像新鲜的血。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">James Vane, Basil Hallward, Sybil Vane -- these deaths were not important to him now. It was better not to think of the past. Nothing could change that. He must think of himself. "Perhaps," he thought, "if I live a better life, the picture will become less ugly." He remembered the pretty village girl -- he had not destroyed her young life. He had done one good thing. Perhaps the picture had already begun to look better.</div>
