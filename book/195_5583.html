<div class="line_en">The climax came two or three weeks later. Mildred was driven by Philip's behaviour to a pitch of strange exasperation. There were many different emotions in her soul, and she passed from mood to mood with facility. She spent a great deal of time alone and brooded over her position. She did not put all her feelings into words, she did not even know what they were, but certain things stood out in her mind, and she thought of them over and over again. She had never understood Philip, nor had very much liked him; but she was pleased to have him about her because she thought he was a gentleman. She was impressed because his father had been a doctor and his uncle was a clergyman. She despised him a little because she had made such a fool of him, and at the same time was never quite comfortable in his presence; she could not let herself go, and she felt that he was criticising her manners.</div>

<div class="line_en">When she first came to live in the little rooms in Kennington she was tired out and ashamed. She was glad to be left alone. It was a comfort to think that there was no rent to pay; she need not go out in all weathers, and she could lie quietly in bed if she did not feel well. She had hated the life she led. It was horrible to have to be affable and subservient; and even now when it crossed her mind she cried with pity for herself as she thought of the roughness of men and their brutal language. But it crossed her mind very seldom. She was grateful to Philip for coming to her rescue, and when she remembered how honestly he had loved her and how badly she had treated him, she felt a pang of remorse. It was easy to make it up to him. It meant very little to her. She was surprised when he refused her suggestion, but she shrugged her shoulders: let him put on airs if he liked, she did not care, he would be anxious enough in a little while, and then it would be her turn to refuse; if he thought it was any deprivation to her he was very much mistaken. She had no doubt of her power over him. He was peculiar, but she knew him through and through. He had so often quarrelled with her and sworn he would never see her again, and then in a little while he had come on his knees begging to be forgiven. It gave her a thrill to think how he had cringed before her. He would have been glad to lie down on the ground for her to walk on him. She had seen him cry. She knew exactly how to treat him, pay no attention to him, just pretend you didn't notice his tempers, leave him severely alone, and in a little while he was sure to grovel. She laughed a little to herself, good-humouredly, when she thought how he had come and eaten dirt before her. She had had her fling now. She knew what men were and did not want to have anything more to do with them. She was quite ready to settle down with Philip. When all was said, he was a gentleman in every sense of the word, and that was something not to be sneezed at, wasn't it? Anyhow she was in no hurry, and she was not going to take the first step. She was glad to see how fond he was growing of the baby, though it tickled her a good deal; it was comic that he should set so much store on another man's child. He was peculiar and no mistake.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="起初她来到肯宁顿大街这套小小的公寓时，整个人身心俱疲，倍感羞耻。没人搭理她，她反倒挺高兴。何况不用付房租，就相当于少了一桩心事，不用再顶着暴雨烈日出去工作，身体不舒服也可以静静在床上躺一会儿。她痛恨自己的生活。强装笑脸、寄人篱下的日子实在可怕，直到今天，每次想起男人有多么心狠手辣、言语下流，她都要为自己的悲惨境遇落下几滴泪。可她其实很少想这些事。她很感激菲利普救了自己。记得他爱她的心曾经是那么真诚炽热，而她却待他恶劣不堪。悔恨之情每每如大锤凿心。想要补偿他似乎很简单，陪个男人上床对她来说不过家常便饭。可她提出这个建议时，却惊讶地发现遭到了他的拒绝。不过，她满不在乎：就让他摆架子好了，反正都是无所谓的事儿，过不了多久他就要猴急着来求自己了，等到那时候，反该轮到她不答应了呢。如果他觉得这是她的损失，那可真是大错特错了。她从不怀疑自己早已吃定他了。他虽个性古怪，可绝对逃不出自己的手掌心。过去他时常和她争吵，每次都发誓再也不来找她，可没多久就又惨兮兮地伏在地上求她原谅了。看到他在自己面前点头哈腰、百依百顺，她的心里就掠过一阵兴奋。他巴不得躺在地上让她随便践踏呢。她见过他哭，对他的那点小心思了如指掌，知道该怎么故意对他视而不见，装着没注意到他发脾气，撇下他就走。不出一刻，他必定会像条狗一样摇尾乞怜。一想到他在自己面前含垢忍耻的傻样儿，她就偷偷笑了起来。反正已经放纵过一次，也知道男人都是什么德行，所以不指望再和他们有什么瓜葛。她准备要跟着菲利普过日子。毕竟他是个不折不扣的绅士，这可不是闹着玩儿的，对不对？再说她也不急着迈出那关键一步。她看见菲利普越来越喜欢自己的孩子，虽说这有点可笑，但心里还是很高兴：这个呆子竟然对别的男人的种疼爱万分，真是脑子有问题，妥妥是这样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But one or two things surprised her. She had been used to his subservience: he was only too glad to do anything for her in the old days, she was accustomed to see him cast down by a cross word and in ecstasy at a kind one; he was different now, and she said to herself that he had not improved in the last year. It never struck her for a moment that there could be any change in his feelings, and she thought it was only acting when he paid no heed to her bad temper. He wanted to read sometimes and told her to stop talking: she did not know whether to flare up or to sulk, and was so puzzled that she did neither. Then came the conversation in which he told her that he intended their relations to be platonic, and, remembering an incident of their common past, it occurred to her that he dreaded the possibility of her being pregnant. She took pains to reassure him. It made no difference. She was the sort of woman who was unable to realise that a man might not have her own obsession with sex; her relations with men had been purely on those lines; and she could not understand that they ever had other interests. The thought struck her that Philip was in love with somebody else, and she watched him, suspecting nurses at the hospital or people he met out; but artful questions led her to the conclusion that there was no one dangerous in the Athelny household; and it forced itself upon her also that Philip, like most medical students, was unconscious of the sex of the nurses with whom his work threw him in contact. They were associated in his mind with a faint odour of iodoform. Philip received no letters, and there was no girl's photograph among his belongings. If he was in love with someone, he was very clever at hiding it; and he answered all Mildred's questions with frankness and apparently without suspicion that there was any motive in them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="后来发生的一两件事让她大为吃惊。她早就习惯了菲利普在自己面前的一脸奴才相：曾经只要能为她做点什么，他都会乐得不行；骂他一句，他就沮丧半天；给个笑脸，他就喜不自胜。可现在的他和过去判若两人。她曾经自言自语，心想他这一年毫无长进，有时故意假装不在乎她发脾气，可那都是装出来的。对于她来说，一刻都没想过他的感觉也是会变的。有时候，他只想静静读会儿书，让她闭上嘴，这时她不知该大发雷霆还是该闷闷不乐，最后只能晕头晕脑地愣在那里。后来他说只想跟她维持柏拉图式的关系，她联想到之前发生的事，觉得他只是害怕会搞大她的肚子。她好说歹说地打消他的疑虑，可情况还是没有改观。她根本意识不到不是所有男人都像她一样对男女之事这么饥渴，她之所以和男人搞到一起，为的也就是这点儿生理需求。她无法理解，其他人会有些别的兴趣爱好。难道是他爱上别人了？她观察着他的一举一动，怀疑他和医院里的护士看对了眼，又拐弯抹角地问了好些问题，确定他看上的不是阿西尔尼家里的女人。后来，她不得不承认，正像所有医学生一样，他并不把一起工作的护士当成女人看待。这些护士只能让他联想起碘酒的味道。也没有人给他写信，他的柜子抽屉里也都没有女孩的照片。若是真爱上了一个人，他一定会把照片都藏起来的。她问他问题，他就老老实实地回答，一点也没觉得这里面大有猫腻。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a relief, for in that case he was certainly still in love with her; but it made his behaviour very puzzling. If he was going to treat her like that why did he ask her to come and live at the flat? It was unnatural. Mildred was not a woman who conceived the possibility of compassion, generosity, or kindness. Her only conclusion was that Philip was queer. She took it into her head that the reasons for his conduct were chivalrous; and, her imagination filled with the extravagances of cheap fiction, she pictured to herself all sorts of romantic explanations for his delicacy. Her fancy ran riot with bitter misunderstandings, purifications by fire, snow-white souls, and death in the cruel cold of a Christmas night. She made up her mind that when they went to Brighton she would put an end to all his nonsense; they would be alone there, everyone would think them husband and wife, and there would be the pier and the band. When she found that nothing would induce Philip to share the same room with her, when he spoke to her about it with a tone in his voice she had never heard before, she suddenly realised that he did not want her. She was astounded. She remembered all he had said in the past and how desperately he had loved her. She felt humiliated and angry, but she had a sort of native insolence which carried her through. He needn't think she was in love with him, because she wasn't. She hated him sometimes, and she longed to humble him; but she found herself singularly powerless; she did not know which way to handle him. She began to be a little nervous with him. Once or twice she cried. Once or twice she set herself to be particularly nice to him; but when she took his arm while they walked along the front at night he made some excuse in a while to release himself, as though it were unpleasant for him to be touched by her. She could not make it out. The only hold she had over him was through the baby, of whom he seemed to grow fonder and fonder: she could make him white with anger by giving the child a slap or a push; and the only time the old, tender smile came back into his eyes was when she stood with the baby in her arms. She noticed it when she was being photographed like that by a man on the beach, and afterwards she often stood in the same way for Philip to look at her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="好歹算松了口气，这样看来，他一定还是爱着她的，可这也使他的行为变得异常古怪。如果他执意要和她保持距离，又为何请她搬来一起住呢？这也太不能理解了。她不相信这世上有同情、慷慨和善良的存在。折腾一番，得出结论：菲利普就是个怪人。她坚信他这么做是为了向自己献殷勤，她脑子里充满了数不清的从廉价小说里读来的情节，幻想他矜持的背后有各种各样罗曼蒂克的解释。她的想象就此发散开来，也许是因为两人之间存在着痛苦的误会，或是不洁的欲望正在为火所净化涤荡。她还想到灵魂的本色如雪花一般洁白无瑕，想到苦寒的平安夜里死去的人们。她决计一到布莱顿就给这段荒谬的关系来个了结。他们要在那儿共处一室。在别人眼里，他俩就是一对夫妻，况且还有码头和乐队能给他们助助兴。然而，当她发现他怎么也不肯和她同住一屋、听他以一种她从没听过的低嗓门和她说话时，才猛然醒悟，原来他真的不想要她。这个发现无异于晴天霹雳。她还记得过去那些绵绵情话，记得他曾如痴如狂地爱着自己。可现在恼羞成怒的她也只好借着自己天生的傲慢性子，咬牙与他的冷漠相对峙。他不需要再惦念她是否还爱他，因为她确是不爱的。她有时恨他入骨，想让他在自己面前低下头来，却苦于无能为力，不知道该拿他怎么办。和他在一起的时候，她开始有点紧张了。有那么一两次，她在他面前掉泪，还有一两次，她使劲浑身解数，百般示好。当他们一起散步，她小鸟依人地挽着他，可没走几步他就要找法子把她甩开，好像不愿意被她碰到。她搞不明白他脑子里在想些什么。唯一能牵绊住他的就是孩子了。眼看他对这个孩子的感情越来越深：有时候打她一巴掌或者推她一把，都能让他气得脸色煞白。只有在她怀里抱着孩子的时候，才能从他的眼神里看到昔日那种温柔宠溺的笑意。有一次，她抱着孩子站在海滩上让一个男人给照相，忽然发现了这件事，之后便经常怀抱小孩让菲利普用那样的眼神看她。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When they got back to London Mildred began looking for the work she had asserted was so easy to find; she wanted now to be independent of Philip; and she thought of the satisfaction with which she would announce to him that she was going into rooms and would take the child with her. But her heart failed her when she came into closer contact with the possibility. She had grown unused to the long hours, she did not want to be at the beck and call of a manageress, and her dignity revolted at the thought of wearing once more a uniform. She had made out to such of the neighbours as she knew that they were comfortably off: it would be a come-down if they heard that she had to go out and work. Her natural indolence asserted itself. She did not want to leave Philip, and so long as he was willing to provide for her, she did not see why she should. There was no money to throw away, but she got her board and lodging, and he might get better off. His uncle was an old man and might die any day, he would come into a little then, and even as things were, it was better than slaving from morning till night for a few shillings a week. Her efforts relaxed; she kept on reading the advertisement columns of the daily paper merely to show that she wanted to do something if anything that was worth her while presented itself. But panic seized her, and she was afraid that Philip would grow tired of supporting her. She had no hold over him at all now, and she fancied that he only allowed her to stay there because he was fond of the baby. She brooded over it all, and she thought to herself angrily that she would make him pay for all this some day. She could not reconcile herself to the fact that he no longer cared for her. She would make him. She suffered from pique, and sometimes in a curious fashion she desired Philip. He was so cold now that it exasperated her. She thought of him in that way incessantly. She thought that he was treating her very badly, and she did not know what she had done to deserve it. She kept on saying to herself that it was unnatural they should live like that. Then she thought that if things were different and she were going to have a baby, he would be sure to marry her. He was funny, but he was a gentleman in every sense of the word, no one could deny that. At last it became an obsession with her, and she made up her mind to force a change in their relations. He never even kissed her now, and she wanted him to: she remembered how ardently he had been used to press her lips. It gave her a curious feeling to think of it. She often looked at his mouth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="回到伦敦，她开始找工作了。之前曾信誓旦旦地说自己不愁找不着活。她想脱离菲利普一个人生活，想到将来能挺直腰板儿站在他面前，宣布自己要带着孩子搬出去住，她就觉得格外心满意足。但离这种可能性越近，她反而越退缩。她已经不习惯长时间工作，也不想再听经理的使唤，更因为自尊心作祟，一想到要再穿上那身工作制服就感到一阵作呕。她已经让相熟的邻居们都相信了她和菲利普日子过得很富裕，这会儿再跑出去工作岂不是自相矛盾、丢人现眼？更何况她本来就是把懒骨头。只要菲利普还愿给她一口吃喝，她就不想离开他。为什么非要离开呢？现在这日子过得是不够宽绰，但起码有地方住，肚子也饿不着，而且他说不定还能越过越富裕呢。他的大伯是个老头子了，没准哪天就一命呜呼，到时候他可能会继承一小笔遗产。再者说，哪怕就是现在这样的日子也比早出晚归地卖命工作，一周挣个几先令要强啊。她一下子就松懈了，虽然每天还是看着报纸上的招工启事，但只是摆摆样子，装得好像有好活儿了她就会去干一样。她有时也会陷入恐慌，害怕菲利普哪天不再养着她了。她的手里已经没有了筹码，也许之所以还能赖在这儿，只是因为菲利普喜欢这个孩子。她把所有事儿摆出来想了一遍，暗暗发誓有朝一日定要让他为这些日子表现出的冷漠而付出代价。她不能接受他已经不再喜欢自己了这个事实，非要逼他重燃爱火才行。她气得紧，偶尔竟莫名其妙地想要得到他。她因他的冷漠而怒火中烧，却又不停地想着他。她到底做了什么，让他对她这样恶劣？她不断地自言自语，絮叨着孤男寡女这样住在一起太不通人情。如果情况能有些不同，她又即将要生产，想必到那时他一定会娶她的。虽然他为人愚蠢可笑，可好歹是个不折不扣的绅士啊，没有人能否认这一点。最后，她像魔怔了一样，决心要改变两人之间的关系。他现在再也不吻她了，可她却开始想得到他的吻；他曾是那么动情，紧紧吻在她的唇上。回首当初，心头腾起莫名的情感。她总是不由自主地盯着他的嘴唇看。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">One evening, at the beginning of February, Philip told her that he was dining with Lawson, who was giving a party in his studio to celebrate his birthday; and he would not be in till late; Lawson had bought a couple of bottles of the punch they favoured from the tavern in Beak Street, and they proposed to have a merry evening. Mildred asked if there were going to be women there, but Philip told her there were not; only men had been invited; and they were just going to sit and talk and smoke: Mildred did not think it sounded very amusing; if she were a painter she would have half a dozen models about. She went to bed, but could not sleep, and presently an idea struck her; she got up and fixed the catch on the wicket at the landing, so that Philip could not get in. He came back about one, and she heard him curse when he found that the wicket was closed. She got out of bed and opened.</div>

<div class="line_en">She paused and drew in her breath sharply. Then she burst into a furious torrent of abuse. She shouted at the top of her voice. She called him every foul name she could think of. She used language so obscene that Philip was astounded; she was always so anxious to be refined, so shocked by coarseness, that it had never occurred to him that she knew the words she used now. She came up to him and thrust her face in his. It was distorted with passion, and in her tumultuous speech the spittle dribbled over her lips.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她顿了顿，狠狠抽了几口气，缓过神来便开始破口大骂。她扯着嗓子，用尽了所有能想到的难听的词。从她嘴里吐出来的话竟能那样下流肮脏，菲利普吓了一跳：过去她一直强装文雅，还真想不到她肚子里藏着这么多的污言秽语。骂着骂着，她走过来，近乎把脸都贴到他面前了。她的脸气愤到扭曲，嘴角堆满了唾沫星子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then she burst again into abominable invective. She accused him of every mean fault; she said he was stingy, she said he was dull, she said he was vain, selfish; she cast virulent ridicule on everything upon which he was most sensitive. And at last she turned to go. She kept on, with hysterical violence, shouting at him an opprobrious, filthy epithet. She seized the handle of the door and flung it open. Then she turned round and hurled at him the injury which she knew was the only one that really touched him. She threw into the word all the malice and all the venom of which she was capable. She flung it at him as though it were a blow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她又开始大骂，把这段时间发生过的所有微不足道的错误都归罪于他，说他抠门，骂他愚蠢，嫌他虚荣自私，在他最脆弱敏感的伤口上狠狠地撒盐。最后，她准备要进屋了，嘴里还是不干不净地骂骂咧咧，像个疯子一样宣泄着怒火。她拧开门把手，推开门，转身来了最致命的一击。只有这句话才能一刀命中，捅到他心里。她恶狠狠地吐出这几个字，像一个脆生生的耳光“啪”地甩在他脸上：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I never cared for you, not once, I was making a fool of you always, you bored me, you bored me stiff, and I hated you, I would never have let you touch me only for the money, and it used to make me sick when I had to let you kiss me.
