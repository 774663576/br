<div class="line_en">But they were as pious, good, industrious, and amiable children as any that were in the world, only Snow-White was more quiet and gentle than Rose-Red.

<div class="line_en">Snow-White and Rose-Red kept their mother's cottage so clean that it was a pleasure to enter it. Every morning in the summer-time Rose-Red would first put the house in order, and then gather a nose gay for her mother, in which she always placed a bud from each rose tree. Every winter's morning Snow-White would light the fire and put the kettle on to boil, and although the kettle was made of copper it yet shone like gold, because it was scoured so well. In the evening, when the flakes of snow were falling, the mother would say;"Go, Snow White, and bolt the door"; and then they used to sit down on the hearth, and the mother would put on her spectacles and read out of a great book while her children sat spinning. By their side, too, lay a little lamb, and on a perch behind them a little white dove reposed with her head under her wing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="白玫瑰和红玫瑰每天都把妈妈的小屋打扫得非常干净，使人一走进小屋，就感到愉快。 夏季里，每天早晨红玫瑰所做的第一件事就是打扫房间，然后她会给妈妈采集一束花，在花束中间，总有从门前的那两株玫瑰树上分别摘下来一红一白的两朵玫瑰花苞。 冬天时，每日清晨白玫瑰就会把火生起来，然后放上水壶烧水。 虽然水壶是铜制的，但是它却闪耀如金，这是因为水壶总是擦得很亮。 到了晚上，当雪片纷飞时，母亲就会说，“白玫瑰，去把门闩上。 ”然后，她们全家坐在壁炉前，妈妈会戴起眼镜，念一册大书中的故事，这时小姑娘们就在一边坐着纺纱。 在她们的身旁还躺着一头小羊羔，并且在她们后面的栖木上，一只小白鸽把头藏在翅膀下，安然入睡了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">No accident ever befell them; and if they stayed late in the forest, and night came upon them, they used to lie down on the moss and sleep till morning; and because their mother knew they would do so, she felt no concern about them.</div>

<div class="line_en">One time when they had thus passed the night in the forest, and the dawn of morning awoke them, they saw a beautiful child dressed in shining white sitting near their couch. She got up and looked at them kindly, but without saying anything went into the forest. The children saw they had slept close to the edge of a pit, into which they would have certainly fallen had they walked farther in the dark. Their mother told them the figure was doubtless the good angel who watches over children.</div>

They pulled his long, shaggy skin, set their feet upon his back and rolled him to and fro, and even ventured to beat him with a hazel stick, laughing when he grumbled.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在他要进门之前，大熊说，“孩子们，快来把我外衣上的雪拍掉。 ”于是她们拿起扫帚，把大熊身上的雪扫干净。 随后，大熊在火炉前伸了伸腿，一边哼声表示很满意，没多久，孩子们就跟大熊混熟了，并且熟得和这头温顺的野兽开起玩笑来。 她们拉拉他那长长毛茸茸的毛皮，踩在他的背上，把他翻来翻去，甚至胆敢用榛木棍来打他。 当大熊哼叫抱怨时，她们就大笑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But as soon as spring returned, and everything out of doors was green gagin, the Bear one morning told Snow-White that he must leave her, and could not return during the whole summer."Where are you going, then, dear Bear" asked Snow-White. " I am obliged to go into the forest and guard my treasures from the evil Dwarfs; for in winter, when ground is hard, they are obliged to keep in their holes, and cannot work through; but now, since the sun has thawed the earth and warmed it, the Dwarfspierce through, and steal all they can find; and what has once passed into their hands, and gets concealed by them in their caves, is not easily brought to light." Snow-White, however, was very sad at the departure of the Bear, and opened the door so hesitatingly that when he pressed through it he left behind on the latch a piece of his hairy coat; and through the hole which was made in his coat SnowWhite fancied she saw the glittering of gold; but she was not quite certain of it. The Bear, however, ran hastily away, and was soon hidden behind the trees.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当春天一来临，门外大地又绿时，一天早晨，大熊告诉白玫瑰说，他必须告辞了。 而且整个夏天都不能回来，“亲爱的大熊，那么你会去哪儿呢？”白玫瑰问道。 “我必须去森林中看守我的金银财宝，防备那可恶的小矮人来偷。 ”因为在冬天，地面是硬梆梆的，小矮人只得呆在洞里，弄不穿地面搞鬼。 现在太阳已将泥土解冻，把泥土晒得暖暖的，小矮人就能钻穿地面，凡找得到的东西，他们都会偷，而且无论什么东西，一到他们手中被他们藏进他们的山洞之后，再要找回来就很困难了。 ”看到大熊要离去，白玫瑰感到非常伤心，很勉强地把门打开。 当大熊挤出大门时，在门闩上留下了他那毛外衣的一小片。 通过那外衣上被钩破的小洞，白玫瑰似乎看见里面有金子在闪亮，但她不能肯定，是不是。 大熊一出门就急急忙忙地跑开了，很快消失在树林中。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The maidens were now accustomed to his ingratitude, and so they walked on to the town and transacted their business there. Coming home, theyreturned over the same common, and unawares walked up to a certain clean spot on which the Dwarf had shaken out his bag of precious stones, thinking nobody was near. The sun was shining, and the bright stones gilttered in its beams and displayed such a variety of colors that the two maidens stopped to admire them.</div>

<div class="line_en">The maidens were then going to run away, but the Bear called after them: "Snow-White and RoseRed, fear not. Wait a bit and I will accompany you. " They recognized his voice and stopped; and when the Bear came, his rough coat suddenly fell off, and he stood up a tall man, dressed entirely in gold. "I am a king's son, "he said, "And I was condemned by the wicked Dwarf, who stole all my treasures, to wander about in this forest, in the form of a bear, till his death released me. Now he has received his well deserved punishment. "</div>
