<div class="line_en">Because you don't need to close your eyes to get to the Land-of-Almost-Awake. That's the whole point of it, sort of thing. You only need to be almost asleep. And in those last few seconds when your eyes are closing, when the mists come rolling in across the boundary between what you think and what you just know, that's when you set off. You ride into the Land-of-Almost-Awake on the backs of cloud animals, because that's the only way of getting there. The cloud animals come in through Granny's balcony door and pick her and Elsa up, and then they fly higher and higher and higher until Elsa sees all the magical creatures that live in the Land-of-Almost-Awake: the enphants and regretters and the Noween and wurses and snow-angels and princes and princesses and knights. The cloud animals soar over the endless dark forests, where Wolfheart and all the other monsters live, then they sweep down through the blindingly bright colors and soft winds to the city gates of the kingdom of Miamas.</div>

<div class="line_en">Miamas is Elsa and Granny's secret kingdom. It is one of six kingdoms in the Land-of-Almost-Awake. Granny came up with it when Elsa was small and Mum and Dad had just got divorced and Elsa was afraid of sleeping because she'd read on the Internet about children who died in their sleep. Granny is good at coming up with things. So when Dad moved out of the flat and everyone was upset and tired, Elsa sneaked out the front door every night and scampered across the landing in her bare feet into Granny's flat, and then she and Granny crawled into the big wardrobe that never stopped growing, and then they half-closed their eyes and set off.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="密阿玛斯是爱莎和外婆的秘密王国，是不眠大陆的六个王国之一。在爱莎更小的时候，爸妈离婚那会儿，她在网上看到有小孩会在睡眠中死去，所以害怕入睡。那时，外婆设想出了这个世界。外婆很擅长出主意。所以，当爸爸搬出公寓，每个人都感到沮丧疲累时，爱莎每晚都会偷偷溜出前门，赤脚跑去外婆的公寓，然后和外婆爬进无限扩展的衣橱中，半闭上眼睛，然后启程。">查看中文翻译</div>

You could tell that she was very angry, but she was controlled and full of composure and never even raised her voice, because Mum is everything Elsa's granny is not.

<div class="line_en">It's difficult to say for sure whether Granny is a bit odd because she's spent too much time in Miamas, or Miamas is a bit odd because Granny's spent too much time there. But this is the source of all of Granny's amazing, monstrous, magical fairy tales.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="很难说清，到底是因为在密阿玛斯待了太长时间让外婆变得有点儿古怪，还是因为外婆在那儿待了太长时间让密阿玛斯变得有点儿古怪。不管怎么说，它是外婆所有精彩、可怕、神奇的童话故事的来源。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Granny says that the kingdom has been called Miamas for an eternity of at least ten thousand fairy tales, but Elsa knows that Granny only made this up because Elsa couldn't say "pajamas" when she was small and used to say "mjamas" instead. Except of course Granny insists that she never made up a bloody thing and Miamas and the other five kingdoms in the Land-of-Almost-Awake are not only real, but actually far more real than the world we're in now, where "everyone is an economist and drinks lactose-free milk and makes a right fuss." Granny isn't particularly good at living in the real world. There are too many rules. She cheats when she plays Monopoly and drives Renault in the bus lane and steals those yellow carrier bags from IKEA and won't stand behind the line when she's at the conveyor belt at the airport. And when she goes to the bathroom she leaves the door open.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="外婆说，很久很久之前这个王国就被称为密阿玛斯，起码有“一万个童话永恒”那么久，但爱莎知道这个名字是外婆瞎编的。当然外婆坚称她从未瞎编过任何东西，密阿玛斯和另外五个王国不仅是真实的，而且远比我们现在身处的这个“人人都是经济学家、喝无乳糖牛奶、喜欢大惊小怪”的世界更加真实。外婆不太擅长在真实世界生活。条条框框太多了。她玩大富翁的时候作弊，在公交车道上驾驶雷诺，从宜家偷黄色购物袋，在机场的行李转盘取行李时从来不站在线外等待，上厕所也总是不关门。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">All fairy tales that are worth something come from Miamas, says Granny. The other five kingdoms in the Land-of-Almost-Awake are busy doing other things: Mirevas is the kingdom where they stand guard over dreams, Miploris is the kingdom where they store all sorrow, Mimovas is where music comes from, Miaudacas is where courage comes from, and Mibatalos is the kingdom where the bravest warriors, who fought against the fearsome shadows in the War-Without-End, were raised.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="外婆说，所有有价值的故事都来自密阿玛斯。不眠大陆的其余五个王国都忙于其他事情：密瑞瓦斯守护梦想，密普洛瑞斯存储哀伤，密莫瓦斯是音乐的发源地，密奥达卡斯是勇气的故乡，而最英勇的战士都在密巴塔洛斯长大，正是他们在无尽战争中对抗那些可怕的暗影。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But Miamas is Granny and Elsa's favorite kingdom, because there storytelling is considered the noblest profession of all. The currency there is imagination; instead of buying something with coins, you buy it with a good story. Libraries aren't known as libraries but as "banks," and every fairy tale is worth a fortune. Granny spends millions every night: tales full of dragons and trolls and kings and queens and witches. And shadows. Because all imaginary worlds have to have terrible enemies, and in the Land-of-Almost-Awake the enemies are the shadows, because the shadows want to kill the imagination. And if we're going to talk about shadows, we must mention Wolfheart. He was the one who defeated the shadows in the War-Without-End. He was the first and greatest superhero Elsa ever heard about.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="密阿玛斯是外婆和爱莎最喜欢的王国，因为在那里，讲故事是最高尚的职业；货币是“想象”，买东西时不用钱币而是用一个好故事来交换；图书馆不是图书馆，是“银行”，每个童话故事都值一大笔钱。外婆每天晚上一掷千金：讲述许多关于龙、巨怪、国王、皇后和女巫的故事，当然还有暗影。所有幻想世界都必须有可怕的敌人，在不眠大陆，那敌人便是暗影。因为暗影想要除掉想象力。说起暗影，就不得不提到狼心。他就是在无尽战争中击败暗影的人。他是爱莎听说过的第一位也是最伟大的超级英雄。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Elsa was knighted in Miamas; she gets to ride cloud animals and have her own sword. She hasn't once been afraid to fall asleep since Granny started taking her there each night. Because in Miamas no one says girls can't be knights, and the mountains reach up to the sky, and the campfires never go out, and no one tries to shred your Gryffindor scarf.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱莎在密阿玛斯被封为骑士，她可以骑乘云兽并拥有自己的佩剑。自从外婆开始每晚带她去密阿玛斯，她再也没有害怕过入睡。因为在密阿玛斯，没有人说女孩不能当骑士，群山高耸至天际，营火从不熄灭，也没有人会来扯破你的格兰芬多围巾。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Of course, Granny also says that no one in Miamas closes the door when they go to the bathroom. An open-door policy is more or less legally enforceable in every situation across the Land-of-Almost-Awake. But Elsa is pretty sure she is describing another version of the truth there. That's what Granny calls lies: "other versions of the truth." So when Elsa wakes up in a chair in Granny's room at the hospital the next morning, Granny is on the toilet with the door open, while Elsa's mum is in the hall, and Granny is in the midst of telling another version of the truth. It's not going all that well. The real truth, after all, is that Granny escaped from the hospital last night and Elsa sneaked out of the flat while Mum and George were sleeping, and they went to the zoo together in Renault, and Granny climbed the fence. Elsa quietly admits to herself that it now seems a little irresponsible to have done all this with a seven-year-old in the middle of the night.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当然，外婆还说，在密阿玛斯，人们上厕所时从不关门。在不眠大陆，任何情况下保持门户开放，或多或少都算是一项法定的强制性政策。但爱莎很确定她是在描述“真相的另一种版本”。外婆就是这么形容谎言的——真相的另一种版本。所以，当爱莎在外婆房间的椅子上醒来时，外婆正坐在马桶上，厕所大门敞开，而妈妈则在门厅，听外婆说着“真相的另一种版本”。这情况可不太妙。说到底，真正的真相，是外婆昨晚从医院偷跑出来，而爱莎趁妈妈和乔治睡觉时溜出了公寓，她们一起开着雷诺去了动物园，然后外婆翻过了围墙。爱莎自己也不得不承认，外婆大半夜带一个七岁小孩干这些事，现在看起来的确有些不负责任。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Granny, whose clothes are lying in a pile on the floor and still very literally smelling a bit monkey-ish, is claiming that when she was climbing the fence by the monkey cage and the guard shouted at her, she thought he could have been a "lethal rapist," and this was why she started throwing muck at him and the police. Mum shakes her head in a very controlled way and says Granny is making all this up. Granny doesn't like it when people say that things are made-up, and reminds Mum she prefers the less derogatory term "reality-challenged." Mum clearly disagrees but controls herself. Because she is everything that Granny isn't.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mum responds by methodically running through all the trouble Granny has caused. Granny says the only reason she's getting so worked up is that she doesn't have a sense of humor.

And when Mum doesn't answer, Granny yells from the toilet, "In a gAAARRRage!" Mum just sighs, massages her temples, and closes the bathroom door.

<div class="line_en">A nurse comes into the room and quietly asks for a moment of Mum's time. She gives Mum a piece of paper and Mum writes something on it and returns it, and then the nurse leaves. Granny has had nine different nurses since she was admitted. Seven of these she refused to cooperate with, and two refused to cooperate with her, one of them because Granny said he had a "nice ass." Granny insists it was a compliment to his ass, not to him, and he shouldn't make such a fuss about it. Then Mum told Elsa to put on her headphones, but Elsa still heard their argument about the difference between "sexual harassment" and "basic appreciation of a perfectly splendid ass."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一位护士走进房间，轻声要求和妈妈说几句话。她给了妈妈一张纸，妈妈在上面写了些东西然后递回去，接着护士便离开了。自从住院之后，负责照顾外婆的护士换了九位。其中七位，外婆拒绝配合他们，而另两位拒绝迁就外婆，其中一位是因为外婆说他有个“漂亮的屁股”。外婆坚称，这是对他屁股的赞美，不是针对他，他不应该大惊小怪的。这时，妈妈叫爱莎戴上耳机，但爱莎依旧可以听见她们的争吵，关于“性骚扰”和“对于一个漂亮屁股的基本欣赏”之间的区别。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She's been in the hospital for two weeks now, but absconds almost every day and picks up Elsa, and they have ice cream or go to the flat when Mum isn't home and make a soapsud slide on the landing. Or break into zoos. Basically whatever appeals to her, whenever. But Granny doesn't consider this an "escape" in the proper sense of the word, because she believes there has to be some basic aspect of challenge to the whole thing if it's to count as an escape -- a dragon or a series of traps or at least a wall and a respectably sized moat, and so on. Mum and the hospital staff don't quite agree with her on this point.</div>

<div class="line_en">They argue a lot, Mum and Granny. They've been arguing for as long as Elsa can remember. About everything. If Granny is a dysfunctional superhero, then Mum is very much a fully operational one. Their interaction is a bit like Cyclops and Wolverine in X-Men, Elsa often thinks, and whenever she has those types of thoughts she wishes she had someone around who could understand what she means. People around Elsa don't read enough quality literature and certainly don't understand that X-Men comics count as precisely that. To such philistines Elsa would explain, very slowly, that X-Men are indeed superheroes, but first and foremost they are mutants, and there is a certain academic difference. Anyway, without putting too fine a point on it, she would sum it up by saying that Granny's and Mum's superhero powers are in direct opposition. As if Spider-Man, one of Elsa's favorite superheroes, had an antagonist called Slip-Up Man whose superpower was that he couldn't even climb onto a bench. But in a good way.</div>

Granny writes down things she needs to remember directly on the wall. And not only when she's at home, but on any wall, wherever she is. It's not a perfect system, because in order to remember a particular task she needs to be in exactly the same place where she wrote it down. When Elsa pointed out this flaw, Granny replied indignantly, "There's still a smaller risk of me losing a kitchen wall than your mother losing that poxy telephone!"

Mum is Halfie's mum but George is Halfie's dad, so Halfie is Elsa's half sibling. Or she/he will be, anyway. She/he will be a proper full-size human; a half sibling, but not in any way half a person, Elsa has been promised. She had a couple of confused days until she understood the difference. "Considering how smart you are, you can certainly be a bit of a thickie sometimes," Granny burst out when Elsa asked her about it.
