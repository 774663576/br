<div class="line_en">Every village has its idiosyncrasy, its constitution, often its own code of morality. The levity of some of the younger women in and about Trantridge was marked, and was perhaps symptomatic of the choice spirit who ruled The Slopes in that vicinity. The place had also a more abiding defect; it drank hard. The staple conversation on the farms around was on the uselessness of saving money; and smock-frocked arithmeticians, leaning on their ploughs or hoes, would enter into calculations of great nicety to prove that parish relief was a fuller provision for a man in his old age than any which could result from savings out of their wages during a whole lifetime.</div>

<div class="line_en">The chief pleasure of these philosophers lay in going every Saturday night, when work was done, to Chaseborough, a decayed market town two or three miles distant; and, returning in the small hours of the next morning, to spend Sunday in sleeping off the dyspeptic effects of the curious compounds sold to them as beer by the monopolizers of the once independent inns.</div>

<div class="line_en">For a long time Tess did not join in the weekly pilgrimages. But under pressure from matrons not much older than herself -- for a fieldman's wages being as high at twenty one as at forty, marriage was early here -- Tess at length consented to go. Her first experience of the journey afforded her more enjoyment than she had expected, the hilariousness of the others being quite contagious after her monotonous attention to the poultry-farm all the week. She went again and again. Being graceful and interesting, standing moreover on the momentary threshold of womanhood, her appearance drew down upon her some shy regards from loungers in the streets of Chaseborough; hence, though sometimes her journey to the town was made independently, she always searched for her fellows at nightfall, to have the protection of their companionship homeward.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="长期以来，苔丝都没有参加这些每星期一次的豪饮活动。但是她迫于年纪比她大不了多少的妇女的压力——因为一个种地的工人，在二十岁时挣的工钱同四十岁的工人挣的工钱一样多——苔丝最终还是同意去了。她第一次到那儿去的经历使她得到了她没有想到的快乐，整整一个星期她都在鸡场过着照顾鸡的单调生活，因此别人的快乐都是很能感染她的。她去了又去。她容貌美丽，逗人喜爱，而且又正处在即将发育成熟的年龄，所以她一在猎苑堡的大街上出现，就引来街上游手好闲的人偷偷瞟过来的目光。因此，有时候她虽然是独自一人到那个镇上去，但是在黄昏的时候她总要找她的同伴一起走，以便回家的时候能得到同伴们的照应。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This had gone on for a month or two when there came a Saturday in September, on which a fair and a market coincided; and the pilgrims from Trantridge sought double delights at the inns on that account. Tess's occupations made her late in setting out, so that her comrades reached the town long before her. It was a fine September evening, just before sunset, when yellow lights struggle with blue shades in hair-like lines, and the atmosphere itself forms a prospect without aid from more solid objects, except the innumerable winged insects that dance in it. Through this low-lit mistiness Tess walked leisurely along.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这种情况持续了一两个月，到了九月的一个星期六，这一天定期集市和集市刚好碰到了一起；因此特兰里奇的人就都到猎苑堡的酒店里去寻找双重的快乐。苔丝工作没有干完，出发得晚了，因此她的伙伴们到达镇上时比她早了许多。这是九月里一个美好的傍晚，正是太阳落山的时候，黄色的亮光同蓝色的暮霭相互争斗，变成了一缕缕发丝一样的光线，大气本身就构成了一种景色，除了在大气中展翅乱舞的无数飞虫而外，它根本就不需要更多的实体的帮助。苔丝就在这种暗淡的暮霭中，不慌不忙地向前走去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She did not discover the coincidence of the market with the fair till she had reached the place, by which time it was close upon dusk. Her limited marketing was soon completed; and then as usual she began to look about for some of the Trantridge cottagers.</div>

<div class="line_en">At first she could not find them, and she was informed that most of them had gone to what they called a private little jig at the house of a hay-trusser and peat-dealer who had transactions with their farm. He lived in an out-of-the-way nook of the townlet, and in trying to find her course thither her eyes fell upon Mr d'Urberville standing at a street corner.</div>

<div class="line_en">Approaching the hay-trussers she could hear the fiddled notes of a reel proceeding from some building in the rear; but no sound of dancing was audible -- an exceptional state of things for these parts, where as a rule the stamping drowned the music. The front door being open she could see straight through the house into the garden at the back as far as the shades of night would allow; and nobody appearing to her knock she traversed the dwelling and went up the path to the outhouse whence the sound had attracted her.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a windowless erection used for storage, and from the open door there floated into the obscurity a mist of yellow radiance, which at first Tess thought to be illuminated smoke. But on drawing nearer she perceived that it was a cloud of dust, lit by candies within the outhouse, whose beams upon the haze carried forward the outline of the doorway into the wide night of the garden.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="户外小屋是一座没有窗子的建筑，用来堆放东西的，从打开的房门里，有一股黄色的发亮的烟雾飘出来，溶进屋外的昏暗中，起初苔丝把它们当成了被灯光照亮的烟雾。但是当她走得更近些后，她才发现那只是一片飞扬的尘土，是被屋内的烛光照亮的，烛光照在那层薄雾上，把门厅的轮廓投射到园子中的茫茫夜色里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When she came close and looked in she beheld indistinct forms racing up and down to the figure of the dance, the silence of their footfalls arising from their being overshoe in 'scroff' -- that is to say, the powdery residuum from the storage of peat and other products, the stirring of which by their turbulent feet created the nebulosity that involved the scene. Through this floating, fusty debris of peat and hay, mixed with the perspirations and warmth of the dancers, and forming together a sort of vegeto-human pollen, the muted fiddles feebly pushed their notes, in marked contrast to the spirit with which the measure was trodden out. They coughed as they danced, and laughed as they coughed. Of the rushing couples there could barely be discerned more than the high lights -- the indistinctness shaping them to satyrs clasping nymphs -- a multiplicity of Pans whirling a multiplicity of Syrinxes; Lotis attempting to elude Priapus, and always failing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她走到屋前往里一看，看见一群模糊的人影正按照跳舞的队形来回奔跑着，然而他们跳舞的脚步却没有声音，因为他们脚底下铺的是一层软垫——也就是说，铺了一层堆放土煤和其它产品的煤粉草渣，经过他们混乱脚步的搅动，就扬起一片烟云，笼罩了整个场地。由发着霉湿味的土煤和干草的粉末组成的烟云，同跳舞的人的汗液和体温掺和在一起，形成了一种植物和人类的混合粉末，装有弱音器的小提琴发出软弱无力的声音，同踩着它的节拍而跳出来的兴高采烈形成了鲜明对比。他们一边跳舞一边咳嗽，一边咳嗽又一边欢笑。一对对跳舞的人冲来撞去，也只能在光线最强的地方才看得出他们的影子——在一片模糊之中，他们变成了森林之神萨堤洛斯们①，怀中抱着仙女宁芙②们——一大群潘③和一大群给任克斯④尽情旋转着；罗提斯⑤想躲开普里阿波斯⑥，但总是躲不开。">查看中文翻译</div>

This surely would end it, thought Tess. But it merged in yet another. She became restless and uneasy; yet, having waited so long, it was necessary to wait longer; on account of the fair the roads were dotted with roving characters of possibly ill intent; and, though not fearful of measurable dangers, she feared the unknown. Had she been near Marlott she would have had less dread.</div>

<div class="line_en">They did not vary their partners if their inclination were to stick to previous ones. Changing partners simply meant that a satisfactory choice had not as yet been arrived at by one or other of the pair, and by this time every couple had been suitably matched. It was then that the ecstasy and the dream began, in which emotion was the matter of the universe, and matter but an adventitious intrusion likely to hinder you from spinning where you wanted to spin.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="跳舞的人如果还想继续同原来的舞伴跳舞，他们就用不着更换舞伴了。简单地说，更换舞伴就是说跳舞的两个人中还有一个没有完全感到满意，到了那个时候，所有跳舞的人就会搭配得很合适了。到了那时候，狂欢和梦想也就开始了，在这种狂欢和梦想里，激情变成了宇宙的物质，而物质只不过是一种外来的插进来的东西，有可能妨碍你在想旋转的时候旋转起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">'Don't ye be nervous, my dear good soul,'expostulated, between his coughs, a young man with a wet face, and his straw hat so far back upon his head that the brim encircled it like the nimbus of a saint. 'What's yer hurry? Tomorrow is Sunday, thank God, and we can sleep it off in church time. Now, have a turn with me?' She did not abhor dancing, but she was not going to dance here. The movement grew more passionate: the fiddlers behind the luminous pillar of cloud now and then varied the air by playing on the wrong side of the bridge or with the back of the bow. But it did not matter; the panting shapes spun onwards.</div>

Yet however terrestrial and lumpy their appearance just now to the mean unglamoured eye, to themselves the case was different. They followed the road with a sensation that they were soaring along in a supporting medium, possessed of original and profound thought, themselves and surrounding nature forming an organism of which all the parts harmoniously and joyously interpenetrated each other.

<div class="line_en">Tess, however, had undergone such painful experiences of this kind in her father's house, that the discovery of their condition spoilt the pleasure she was beginning to feel in the moonlight journey. Yet she stuck to the party, for reasons above given.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，苔丝住在她父亲家中的时候，已经经历过这种痛苦的体验了，她一看见她们的情形，她在月光下走路所开始感到的欢乐就被破坏掉了。但是因为上面说过的理由，她还是跟大队人马走在一起。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">All looked at Car. Her gown was a light cotton print, and from the back of her head a kind of rope could be seen descending to some distance below her waist, like a Chinaman's queue.</div>

<div class="line_en">This leading pedestrian was Car the Queen of Spades, who carried a wicker-basket containing her mother's groceries, her own draperies, and other purchases for the week. The basket being large and heavy, Car had placed it for convenience of porterage on the top of her head, where it rode on in jeopardized balance as she walked with arms akimbo.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在最前面走着的是“黑桃皇后”卡尔，她挽着一个柳条篮子，里面装着她母亲的杂货、她自己买的布料、以及这个星期里要用的其它物品。篮子又大又重，卡尔为了走路方便些，就把篮子放在头顶上顶着，当她两手叉腰走路的时候，篮子就在她的头顶上危险地摇晃着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Treacle it was. Car's poor old grandmother had a weakness for the sweet stuff. Honey she had in plenty out of her own hives, but treacle was what her soul desired, and Car had been about to give her a treat of surprise. Hastily lowering the basket the dark girl found that the vessel containing the syrup had been smashed within.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="的确是糖浆。卡尔可怜的老祖母有吃甜食的偏好。蜂蜜在她家里的蜂窠里有的是，但是糖浆才是她一心想要的东西，所以卡尔给她买了糖浆，想给她一个意外的惊喜。那黝黑的姑娘急忙把篮子放下来，发现装糖浆的罐子已经在篮子里打碎了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">By this time there had arisen a shout of laughter at the extraordinary appearance of Car's back, which irritated the dark queen into getting rid of the disfigurement by the first sudden means available, and independently of the help of the scoffers. She rushed excitedly into the field they were about to cross, and flinging herself flat on her back upon the grass, began to wipe her gown as well as she could by spinning horizontally on the herbage and dragging herself over it upon her elbows.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时候大家看见卡尔背上不同寻常的样子，不由得一起哄笑起来，黑桃皇后急着把背上的黑色糖浆弄掉，突然想出来一个当时能想到的办法，这个办法也用不着请那些嘲笑她的人帮忙。她心里激动，就急急忙忙地冲进他们要经过的那块地里，仰面朝天地躺下来，开始在草地上平着旋转，用劲擦她衣服背后的糖浆，她还用胳膊肘把自己从草地上拖过去，又用这种办法把衣服擦了一遍。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="哄笑声更大了；他们看见卡尔的怪相，捧腹大笑起来，笑得没了力气，都一个个地或靠在栅栏门上，或靠在柱子上，或靠在自己的手杖上。我们的女主角苔丝先前一直表现得很平静，这时候也禁不住和大家一起笑了起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was a misfortune -- in more ways than one. No sooner did the dark queen hear the soberer richer note of Tess among those of the other work people than a long smouldering sense of rivalry inflamed her to madness. She sprang to her feet and closely faced the object of her dislike.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是一件不幸的事——在许多方面都是一件不幸的事。黑桃皇后听见了这群工人中出现的苔丝发出来的冷静深沉的笑声，她内心里长期压抑的一股吃醋情绪，就立刻燃烧起来，使她变得疯狂起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">To Tess's horror the dark queen began stripping off the bodice of her gown -- which for the added reason of its ridiculed condition she was only too glad to be free of -- till she had bared her plump neck, shoulders, and arms to the moonshine, under which they looked as luminous and beautiful as some Praxitelean creation, in their possession of the faultless rotundities of a lusty country girl. She closed her fists and squared up at Tess.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="使苔丝吓了一跳的是，“黑桃皇后”开始脱她的上身衣服——真正的原因是弄脏的上衣引人发笑，她正乐意借故把它脱掉——她在月光下脱得露出了浑圆的脖子、肩膀和胳膊，因为她是一个农村姑娘，在朦胧的月色里，她的脖子、肩膀和胳膊光亮美丽、丰满圆润和完美无缺，就像蒲拉克西蒂利①创造的某些作品一样。她握起拳头，对苔丝摆出了进攻的姿态。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Tess was indignant and ashamed. She no longer minded the loneliness of the way and the lateness of the hour; her one object was to get away from the whole crew as soon as possible. She knew well enough that the better among them would repent of their passion next day. They were all now inside the field, and she was edging back to rush off alone when a horseman emerged almost silently from the corner of the hedge that screened the road, and Alec d'Urberville looked round upon them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="苔丝又羞又气。她再也不怕路上孤单了，也不管时间多晚了；她只有一个目的，就是尽快摆脱那一群人。她也知道得很清楚，明天他们中间较好的一些人会为他们的感情冲动懊悔的。那时候他们都已经走到地里面了，她就慢慢地向后移动，想独自跑开，就在这时候，从遮挡着道路的树篱的一角，有一个骑马的人悄悄地出现了，这个人就是阿历克·德贝维尔，他把他们打量了一番。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The rather too inclusive speech brought down a torrent of vituperation from other quarters upon fair Tess's unlucky head, particularly from the Queen of Diamonds, who having stood in the relations to d'Urberville that Car had also been suspected of, united with the latter against the common enemy. Several other women also chimed in, with an animus which none of them would have been so fatuous as to show but for the rollicking evening they had passed. Thereupon, finding Tess unfairly browbeaten, the husbands and lovers tried to make peace by defending her; but the result of that attempt was directly to increase the war.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这句伤了一大群人的话立刻引来了其他人对漂亮的苔丝的一阵滔滔不绝的责骂，把怒气发作到不幸的苔丝身上。尤其是“方块皇后”把其他所有的人联合起来，攻击共同的敌人，因为她同德贝维尔的关系也就是卡尔遭到别人怀疑的那种关系。还有几个其他的女人也齐声响应，她们骂得粗鲁毒辣，要不是她们晚上事先都在寻欢作乐，她们也不会那样愚蠢地乱骂一气的。因此，几个丈夫和情人看见苔丝受到欺负，感到不公平，就想化解这场吵，帮着苔丝说了几句话；但是他们努力的结果，却是更加把战事激化了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She felt almost ready to faint, so vivid was her sense of the crisis. At almost any other moment of her life she should have refused such profferer aid and company, as she had refused them several times before; and now the loneliness would not of itself have forced her to do otherwise. But coming as the invitation did at the particular juncture when fear and indignation at these adversaries could be transformed by a spring of the foot into a triumph over them, she abandoned herself to her impulse, climbed the gate, put her toe upon his instep, and scrambled into the saddle behind him. The pair were speeding away into the distant gray by the time that the contentious revellers became aware of what had happened.</div>

Each pedestrian could see no halo but his or her own, which never deserted the head-shadow, whatever its vulgar unsteadiness might be; but adhered to it, and persistently beautified it; till the erratic motions seemed an inherent part of the irradiation, and the fumes of their breathing a component of the night's mist; and the spirit of the scene, and of the moonlight, and of Nature, seemed harmoniously to mingle with the spirit of wine.</div>
