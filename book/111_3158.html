<div class="line_en">When Stuart arrived at his camp site by the river, he was tired and hot. He put the canoe in the water and was sorry to see that it leaked badly. The birch bark at the stern was held together by a lacing, and the water came in through the seam. In a very few seconds the canoe was half full of water.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯图亚特来到他在河边的营地时，感到又累又热。他把独木舟放到水里，立刻发现它漏水现象十分严重。船尾是用桦树皮拼成的，水就从那拼缝里渗了进来，几秒钟后，独木舟里就装了一半的水。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Darn it!" said Stuart, "I've been swindled." He had paid seventy-six cents for a genuine Indian birchbark canoe, only to find that it leaked.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then he bailed out his canoe and hauled it up on the beach for repairs. He knew he couldn't take Harriet out in a leaky boat -- she wouldn't like it. Tired though he was, he climbed a spruce tree and found some spruce gum. With this he plugged the seam and stopped the leak. Even so, the canoe turned out to be a cranky little craft. If Stuart had not had plenty of experience on the water, he would have got into serious trouble with it. It was a tippy boat even for a souvenir. Stuart carried stones from the beach down to the water's edge and ballasted the canoe with the stones until it floated evenly and steadily. He made a back-rest so that Harriet would be able to lean back and trail her fingers in the water if she wished. He also made a pillow by tying one of his clean handkerchiefs around some moss. Then he went for a paddle to practise his stroke. He was angry that he didn't have anything better than a paper spoon for a paddle, but he decided that there was nothing he could do about it. He wondered whether Harriet would notice that his paddle was really just an ice cream spoon.</div>

<div class="line_en">All that afternoon Stuart worked on the canoe, adjusting ballast, filling seams, and getting everything shipshape for the morrow. He could think of nothing else but his date with Harriet. At suppertime he took his ax, felled a dandelion, opened a can of deviled ham, and had a light supper of ham and dandelion milk. After supper, he propped himself up against a fern, bit off some spruce gum for a chew, and lay there on the bank dreaming and chewing gum. In his imagination he went over every detail of tomorrow's trip with Harriet. With his eyes shut he seemed to see the whole occasion plainly -- how she would look when she came down the path to the water, how calm and peaceful the river was going to be in the twilight, how graceful the canoe would seem, drawn up on the shore. In imagination he lived every minute of their evening together. They would paddle to a large water-lily pad upstream, and he would invite Harriet to step out on the pad and sit awhile. Stuart planned to wear his swimming trunks under his clothes so that he could dive off the lily pad into the cool stream. He would swim the crawl stroke, up and down and all around the lily pad, while Harriet watched, admiring his ability as a swimmer. (Stuart chewed the spruce gum very rapidly as he thought about this part of the episode.)</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="整个下午斯图亚特都在独木舟上工作着。调整压舱的石头，粘合船缝，把该为明天做准备的一切都准备好了。除了和哈丽雅特的会面外，他心里什么都没想。到该吃晚饭时，他拿起他的斧子，砍下了一棵蒲公英，又打开一罐辣味火腿，吃了点火腿，喝了些蒲公英的奶汁。晚饭后，他靠在一棵羊齿植物旁，咬下一些乳胶，然后就嚼着它们躺到岸边做他的美梦了。他不断想象着明天和哈丽雅特会面的每一个细节。虽然闭着眼，他却似乎清楚地看到了这一切——当她往岸边走时是什么样子，薄暮时分的河水又会是多么的沉静，泊在岸边的独木舟看来又会是多么漂亮。他还想象着，自己是怎么和她一起共度这个良宵的每一分钟的。他们会逆流划到一片大荷叶那里，他会邀请哈丽雅特坐到荷叶上小憩片刻。斯图亚特打算在衣服里穿上游泳裤，这样就可以在荷叶下面游泳了。他将以自由式游泳，在荷叶的四周不停地游，哈丽雅特见到了就会夸他是游泳天才的。（当他想着这些小插曲时，嘴里嚼的速度更快了。）">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The next day dawned cloudy. Stuart had to go up to the village to have the oil changed in his car, so he hid the canoe under some leaves, tied it firmly to a stone, and went off on his errand, still thinking about Harriet and wishing it were a nicer day. The sky looked rainy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天有些多云。斯图亚特要到镇子里去给他的车加油，因此便把他的独木舟系在一块石头上藏到树叶下，然后才满怀着对哈丽雅特的渴望和这一天的期盼走了。天看起来好像要下雨。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Suddenly Stuart opened his eyes and sat up. He thought about the letter he had sent and he wondered whether it had ever been delivered. It was an unusually small letter, of course, and might have gone unnoticed in the letterbox. This idea filled him with fears and worries. But soon he let his thoughts return to the river, and as he lay there a whippoorwill began to sing on the opposite shore, darkness spread over the land, and Stuart dropped off to sleep.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然，斯图亚特睁开眼坐了起来，他想不起来他写的那封信到底邮了没有。那封信非常的小，也许不会被人发现。这念头使他恐惧并担忧起来。可不久他的思绪便又回到小河上了，在夜鸱开始在对岸唱歌，黑暗笼罩了大地的时候，斯图亚特终于睡着了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Stuart returned from the village with a headache, but he hoped that it would be better before five o'clock. He felt rather nervous, as he had never taken a girl canoeing before. He spent the afternoon lying around camp, trying on different shirts to see which looked best on him and combing his whiskers. He would no sooner get a clean shirt on than he would discover that it was wet under the arms, from nervous perspiration, and he would have to change it for a dry one. He put on a clean shirt at two o'clock, another at three o'clock, and another at quarter past four. This took up most of the afternoon. As five o'clock drew near, Stuart grew more and more nervous. He kept looking at his watch, glancing up the path, combing his hair, talking to himself, and fidgeting. The day had turned chilly and Stuart was almost sure that there was going to be rain. He couldn't imagine what he would do if it should rain just as Harriet Ames showed up to go canoeing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯图亚特从镇子里回来时有点头痛，他希望在五点钟前可以好起来。他非常的燥乱，因为他从没有过和一个女孩同乘独木舟的经验。一下午，他都在他的营地试穿不同的衬衫，想知道哪一件穿起来更帅，他还不停地用梳子梳他的胡子。可是他最后穿上的那件衬衫后来却被弄脏了，因为由于太紧张，腋下的汗把它弄湿了，于是他只好又换上一件干的。他在两点钟换了一件干净的衬衫，在三点钟又换了一件，在四点十五分则又换了一件。下午剩下的时间就这么被用掉了。马上就到五点钟了，斯图亚特心里越来越紧张。他不停地看着表，往小路那里瞅，梳理头发，自言自语，心烦意乱。天色越来越阴，斯图亚特想一定是快下雨了。他不知道如果他和哈丽雅特划船时天下起雨该怎么办。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，谢谢你的邀请，”哈丽雅特回答。她穿着一件白色羊绒大衣，里面是苏格兰呢绒衬衫，脚上是白色毛袜和蛇皮鞋。她的头上裹着一条鲜艳的头巾，手中拿着一盒薄荷糖。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Sure," repeated Stuart, "if it rains, it rains. My canoe is a short distance up the shore. May I help you over the rough places in the path?" Stuart was a courteous mouse by nature, but Harriet said she didn't need any help. She was an active girl and not at all inclined to stumble or fall. Stuart led the way to where he had hidden the canoe, and Harriet followed, but when they reached the spot Stuart was horrified to discover that the canoe was not there. It had disappeared.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，”斯图亚特重复。“像要下雨了。我的独木舟就停在岸边。路很崎岖，我可以带你去那里吗？”斯图亚特是个生性有礼貌的老鼠。可哈丽雅特却说她不需要帮助。她是个身体很好的女孩子，走路时不会被绊倒。斯图亚特和她一起往藏船的地方走，可当他们到了那里，斯图亚特却惊恐地发现船不见了。它消失了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then he began racing wildly up and down the bank, looking everywhere. Harriet joined in the search, and after a while they found the canoe -- but it was a mess. Some one had been playing with it. A long piece of heavy string was tied to one end. The ballast rocks were gone. The pillow was gone. The back rest was gone. The spruce gum had come out of the seam. Mud was all over everything, and one of the paddles was all bent and twisted. It was just a mess. It looked just the way a birchbark canoe looks after some big boys are finished playing with it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后他开始在岸边来回地搜索，好半天才找到它——可它已经不成样子了。一定有什么人玩过它。它的船尾被系上了一根长绳子，压舱石不见了，枕头也消失了，那个用来休息的后座也被拆走，船缝里的树胶被揭了下来，船上到处都是泥，一只船桨被扭弯了。真是一团糟。一定是某个大男孩发现了它，把它糟蹋成这样的。">查看中文翻译</div>
