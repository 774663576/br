<div class="line_en">They walked in single file. The entrance to the path was like a sort of arch leading into a gloomy tunnel made by two great trees that leant together, too old and strangled with ivy and hung with lichen to bear more than a few blackened leaves. The path itself was narrow and wound in and out among the trunks. Soon the light at the gate was like a little bright hole far behind, and the quiet was so deep that their feet seemed to thump along while all the trees leaned over them and listened.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们排成一路纵队行进着。小径的入口是两棵彼此靠向一起的大树，看起来像是通往某个黑暗隧道的拱门。两棵树老态龙钟，又缠满了藤蔓，附满了苔藓，因此只剩了寥寥几片黑黢黢的树叶。小径本身十分狭窄，在树木之间穿来绕去。很快，入口的亮光就变成了身后远处的一个小亮洞，四周一片死寂，让他们的脚步声成了沉重的鼓声，似乎所有的树木都朝着他们凑了过来，凝神倾听。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There were black squirrels in the wood. As Bilbo's sharp inquisitive eyes got used to seeing things he could catch glimpses of them whisking off the path and scuttling behind tree-trunks. There were queer noises too, grunts, scufflings, and hurryings in the undergrowth, and among the leaves that lay piled endlessly thick in places on the forest-floor; but what made the noises he could not see. The nastiest things they saw were the cobwebs: dark dense cobwebs with threads extraordinarily thick, often stretched from tree to tree, or tangled in the lower branches on either side of them. There were none stretched across the path, but whether because some magic kept it clear, or for what other reason they could not guess.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="森林中有黑色的松鼠，在比尔博锐利的双眼经过适应能看清东西之后，他可以瞥见它们飞快地掠过小径，慌慌张张地躲到了树干后面。在矮树丛中还有许多奇怪的声响，闷哼声、搔抓声以及快速跑动的声音。这类声响也会出现在地上堆得厚厚的腐叶堆中，但是究竟是什么生物弄出这些声响来的他却看不见。他们见到的最恶心的东西就是蜘蛛网了：这些黑暗浓密的网由特别粗的蛛丝织成，往往从一棵树延伸到另一棵树，或是悬挂在道路两侧的低矮树枝上。没有哪张蛛网是拦在道路中央的，但究竟是由于某种魔法还是其他原因才使得道路保持清通的，他们想不出来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As their eyes became used to the dimness they could see a little way to either side in a sort of darkened green glimmer. Occasionally a slender beam of sun that had the luck to slip in through some opening in the leaves far above, and still more luck in not being caught in the tangled boughs and matted twigs beneath, stabbed down thin and bright before them. But this was seldom, and it soon ceased altogether.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="随着眼睛渐渐适应了昏暗，他们看见所走道路的两旁各有一条小路，散发着有点像是墨绿色的暗光。有时，会有一缕细细的阳光通过最上方浓密树叶间的某个缺口，幸运地溜了进来，又凭着更大的幸运没有被下面交错的树枝给拦截，在他们面前刺下一道极细的光线。但这样的情况很罕见，而且马上就完全消失了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The nights were the worst. It then became pitch-dark-not what you call pitch-dark, but really pitch: so black that you really could see nothing. Bilbo tried flapping his hand in front of his nose, but he could not see it at all. Well, perhaps it is not true to say that they could see nothing: they could see eyes. They slept all closely huddled together, and took it in turns to watch; and when it was Bilbo's turn he would see gleams in the darkness round them, and sometimes pairs of yellow or red or green eyes would stare at him from a little distance, and then slowly fade and disappear and slowly shine out again in another place. And sometimes they would gleam down from the branches just above him; and that was most terrifying. But the eyes that he liked the least were horrible pale bulbous sort of eyes. "Insect eyes," he thought, "not animal eyes, only they are much too big."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="夜晚是最糟糕的时段，森林中会变得漆黑一团——这可不是一般人所谓的漆黑，而是真的黑到了极致：黑得你连任何东西都看不见。比尔博试着在鼻子前摆了摆手，根本什么都看不见。不过，也许说什么都看不见不能算是很精确，因为他们可以看见眼睛。他们睡觉的时候全都挤在一起，然后大家轮流守夜。在轮到比尔博值班的时候，他会看见四周的黑暗中有许多微光闪烁，有时候，一双双黄色、红色或是绿色的眼睛，会从不远的地方瞪着他们，然后，那些光芒会慢慢地黯淡并消失，然后又慢慢地在另一个地方再度亮起。有时候，这些光芒会在他们头顶的树枝间向下闪着光，这是最让人害怕的景象。不过，比尔博最讨厌的是那种可怕的、苍白而又突出的眼睛。“那是昆虫的眼睛，”他想，“不是小动物的眼睛，只是稍微有点嫌太大了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was not long before they grew to hate the forest as heartily as they had hated the tunnels of the goblins, and it seemed to offer even less hope of any ending. But they had to go on and on, long after they were sick for a sight of the sun and of the sky, and longed for the feel of wind on their faces. There was no movement of air down under the forest-roof, and it was everlastingly still and dark and stuffy. Even the dwarves felt it, who were used to tunnelling, and lived at times for long whiles without the light of the sun; but the hobbit, who liked holes to make a house in but not to spend summer days in, felt that he was being slowly suffocated.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不久之后，他们就对这座森林产生了厌恶感，其强烈与真挚，一如他们讨厌半兽人的隧道。而且，森林比隧道还更让人盼不到头。他们早就极度渴望能见到阳光和天空的景象，向往凉风拂过脸庞的感觉，但是没办法，他们只能不停地走啊走。在森林的穹盖之下空气没有任何流动，似乎永远就是那么静止、黑暗与窒闷。即使是习惯了长期在地底挖隧道，经常会有很长一段时间见不到日光的矮人，也感受到了这种压迫感。霍比特人虽然喜欢把家安在地底的洞里，但到了夏天也喜欢离家到外面透气，所以这会儿他觉得自己正在慢慢地窒息而死。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Although it was not yet very cold, they tried lighting watch-fires at night, but they soon gave that up. It seemed to bring hundreds and hundreds of eyes all round them, though the creatures, whatever they were, were careful never to let their bodies show in the little flicker of the flames. Worse still it brought thousands of dark-grey and black moths, some nearly as big as your hand, flapping and whirring round their ears. They could not stand that, nor the huge bats, black as a top-hat, either; so they gave up fires and sat at night and dozed in the enormous uncanny darkness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽然天气还不是很冷，他们还是试着想在晚上生起警戒用的篝火，不过他们很快就放弃了。火焰似乎会把成百上千的眼睛吸引到他们的身边来，尽管这些神秘的生物，不管它们到底是什么，总是小心翼翼地不让自己的身躯曝露在微弱火光的照耀之下。更糟糕的是，它会吸引来成千上万深灰色和黑色的蛾子，有些几乎有人的手掌那么大，在他们的耳边不停飞舞，让他们难以忍受。同样让他们受不了的还有那些漆黑得如同高筒礼帽的巨型蝙蝠。于是他们只好放弃了生火，整晚都坐着，在巨大而又诡异的黑暗中渐渐睡去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">All this went on for what seemed to the hobbit ages upon ages; and he was always hungry, for they were extremely careful with their provisions. Even so, as days followed days, and still the forest seemed just the same, they began to get anxious. The food would not last for ever: it was in fact already beginning to get low. They tried shooting at the squirrels, and they wasted many arrows before they managed to bring one down on the path. But when they roasted it, it proved horrible to taste, and they shot no more squirrels.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对霍比特人来说，这一切仿佛有好几年那么久；由于他们一直严格执行食物定额制，所以他总是觉得饿。即便如此，随着时间慢慢流逝，而森林依然一成不变，他们开始感到紧张起来。食物不会永远吃不完，实际上，已经开始有点不够了。他们试着射杀松鼠，在浪费了许多支箭之后好不容易在小径上射到一只。但等他们烤来一吃，发现味道糟糕得简直难以入口，于是他们便再也不射松鼠了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They were thirsty too, for they had none too much water, and in all the time they had seen neither spring nor stream. This was their state when one day they found their path blocked by a running water. It flowed fast and strong but not very wide right across the way, and it was black, or looked it in the gloom. It was well that Beorn had warned them against it, or they would have drunk from it, whatever its colour, and filled some of their emptied skins at its bank. As it was they only thought of how to cross it without wetting themselves in its water. There had been a bridge of wood across, but it had rotted and fallen leaving only the broken posts near the bank.</div>

Fili took this in his hand, balanced it for a moment, and then flung it across the stream.</div>

Dwalin had just scrambled out with the coiled rope on his arm, and Bombur (still grumbling) was getting ready to follow, when something bad did happen. There was a flying sound of hooves on the path ahead. Out of the gloom came suddenly the shape of a flying deer. It charged into the dwarves and bowled them over, then gathered itself for a leap. High it sprang and cleared the water with a mighty jump. But it did not reach the other side in safety. Thorin was the only one who had kept his feet and his wits. As soon as they had landed he had bent his bow and fitted an arrow in case any hidden guardian of the boat appeared. Now he sent a swift and sure shot into the leaping beast. As it reached the further bank it stumbled. The shadows swallowed it up, but they heard the sound of hooves quickly falter and then go still.</div>

Suddenly on the path ahead appeared some white deer, a hind and fawns as snowy white as the hart had been dark. They glimmered in the shadows. Before Thorin could cry out three of the dwarves had leaped to their feet and loosed off arrows from their bows. None seemed to find their mark. The deer turned and vanished in the trees as silently as they had come, and in vain the dwarves shot their arrows after them.</div>

Yet if they had known more about it and considered the meaning of the hunt and the white deer that had appeared upon their path, they would have known that they were at last drawing towards the eastern edge, and would soon have come, if they could have kept up their courage and their hope, to thinner trees and places where the sunlight came again.</div>

If these had not become all too light in the last few days, they would never have managed it; but a slumbering and smiling Bombur was a poor exchange for packs filled with food however heavy.

They were at first inclined to be cheered by the change, for here there was no undergrowth and the shadow was not so deep. There was a greenish light about them, and in places they could see some distance to either side of the path. Yet the light only showed them endless lines of straight grey trunks like the pillars of some huge twilight hall. There was a breath of air and a noise of wind, but it had a sad sound. A few leaves came rustling down to remind them that outside autumn was coming on.

They chose him, because to be of any use the climber must get his head above the topmost leaves, and so he must be light enough for the highest and slenderest branches to bear him. Poor Mr. Baggins had never had much practice in climbing trees, but they hoisted him up into the lowest branches of an enormous oak that grew right out into the path, and up he had to go as best he could. He pushed his way through the tangled twigs with many a slap in the eye; he was greened and grimed from the old bark of the greater boughs; more than once he slipped and caught himself just in time; and at last, after a dreadful struggle in a difficult place where there seemed to be no convenient branches at all, he got near the top. All the time he was wondering whether there were spiders in the tree, and how he was going to get down again (except by falling).</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这“某个人”当然指的就是比尔博了。他们之所以选择他，是因为如果要达到侦察的目的，爬树的人一定得把头伸出最高处的树叶才行，所以他必须要足够轻，能让最高处的最细的树枝承受得起他的重量。可怜的巴金斯先生以前根本没怎么爬过树，但大家不由分说地将他托上了路边一棵大橡树最下面的树枝，接下来他只能好自为之了。他在拨开交错的树枝奋力上行的过程中，眼睛周围好几次都被树枝弹到；老橡树上那些大一点的树枝很快就把他搞得浑身又黑又绿；他还不止一次从树上滑落，于千钧一发之际才抓住了下面的树枝；最后，在一个似乎没有合适的树枝可供踩踏的不上不下的地方，他经过了一番令人心惊胆寒的拼搏，终于接近了树顶。在这一路上，他不停地在担心树上会不会有蝴蛛，以及过会儿他该怎么原路下去（除了掉下去）。">查看中文翻译</div>

It was no good. Gaze as much as he might, he could see no end to the trees and the leaves in any direction.

<div class="line_en">In the end he poked his head above the roof of leaves, and then he found spiders all right. But they were only small ones of ordinary size, and they were after the butterflies. Bilbo's eyes were nearly blinded by the light. He could hear the dwarves shouting up at him from far below, but he could not answer, only hold on and blink. The sun was shining brilliantly, and it was a long while before he could bear it. When he could, he saw all round him a sea of dark green, ruffled here and there by the breeze; and there were everywhere hundreds of butterflies. I expect they were a kind of "purple emperor", a butterfly that loves the tops of oak-woods, but these were not purple at all, they were a dark dark velvety black without any markings to be seen.</div>

<div class="line_en">Up they all jumped. There, sure enough, not far away were scores of twinkling lights, and they heard the voices and the laughter quite plainly. They crept slowly towards them, in a single line, each touching the back of the one in front. When they got near Thorin said: "No rushing forward this time! No one is to stir from hiding till I say. I shall send Mr. Baggins alone first to talk to them. They won't be frightened of him --('What about me of them?' thought Bilbo) -- and any way I hope they won't do anything nasty to him."</div>

<div class="line_en">If it had been difficult collecting themselves before, it was far worse this time. And they simply could not find the hobbit. Every time they counted themselves it only made thirteen. They shouted and called: "Bilbo Baggins! Hobbit! You dratted hobbit! Hi! hobbit, confusticate you, where are you?" and other things of that sort, but there was no answer.</div>

<div class="line_en">After lying and listening for a while, they found they could not resist the desire to go nearer and try once more to get help. Up they got again; and this time the result was disastrous. The feast that they now saw was greater and more magnificent than before; and at the head of a long line of feasters sat a woodland king with a crown of leaves upon his golden hair, very much as Bombur had described the figure in his dream. The elvish folk were passing bowls from hand to hand and across the fires, and some were harping and many were singing. Their gleaming hair was twined with flowers; green and white gems glinted on their collars and their belts; and their faces and their songs were filled with mirth. Loud and clear and fair were those songs, and out stepped Thorin in to their midst.</div>

<div class="line_en">That was one of his most miserable moments. But he soon made up his mind that it was no good trying to do anything till day came with some little light, and quite useless to go blundering about tiring himself out with no hope of any breakfast to revive him. So he sat himself down with his back to a tree, and not for the last time fell to thinking of his far-distant hobbit-hole with its beautiful pantries. He was deep in thoughts of bacon and eggs and toast and butter when he felt something touch him. Something like a strong sticky string was against his left hand, and when he tried to move he found that his legs were already wrapped in the same stuff, so that when he got up he fell over.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then the great spider, who had been busy tying him up while he dozed, came from behind him and came at him. He could only see the thing's eyes, but he could feel its hairy legs as it struggled to wind its abominable threads round and round him. It was lucky that he had come to his senses in time. Soon he would not have been able to move at all. As it was, he had a desperate fight before he got free. He beat the creature off with his hands-it was trying to poison him to keep him quiet, as small spiders do to flies-until he remembered his sword and drew it out. Then the spider jumped back, and he had time to cut his legs loose. After that it was his turn to attack. The spider evidently was not used to things that carried such stings at their sides, or it would have hurried away quicker. Bilbo came at it before it could disappear and stuck it with his sword right in the eyes. Then it went mad and leaped and danced and flung out its legs in horrible jerks, until he killed it with another stroke; and then he fell down and remembered nothing more for a long while.</div>

<div class="line_en">After that he set out to explore. The forest was grim and silent, but obviously he had first of all to look for his friends, who were not likely to be very far off, unless they had been made prisoners by the elves (or worse things). Bilbo felt that it was unsafe to shout, and he stood a long while wondering in what direction the path lay, and in what direction he should go first to look for the dwarves.</div>

<div class="line_en">He had picked his way stealthily for some distance, when he noticed a place of dense black shadow ahead of him, black even for that forest, like a patch of midnight that had never been cleared away. As he drew nearer, he saw that it was made by spider-webs one behind and over and tangled with another. Suddenly he saw, too, that there were spiders huge and horrible sitting in the branches above him, and ring or no ring he trembled with fear lest they should discover him. Standing behind a tree he watched a group of them for some time, and then in the silence and stillness of the wood he realised that these loathsome creatures were speaking one to another. Their voices were a sort of thin creaking and hissing, but he could make out many of the words that they said. They were talking about the dwarves!</div>

<div class="line_en">In the end he made as good a guess as he could at the direction from which the cries for help had come in the night-and by luck (he was born with a good share of it) he guessed more or less right, as you will see. Having made up his mind he crept along as cleverly as he could. Hobbits are clever at quietness, especially in woods, as I have already told you; also Bilbo had slipped on his ring before he started. That is why the spiders neither saw nor heard him coming.</div>

<div class="line_en">Bilbo saw that the moment had come when he must do something. He could not get up at the brutes and he had nothing to shoot with; but looking about he saw that in this place there were many stones lying in what appeared to be a now dry little watercourse. Bilbo was a pretty fair shot with a stone, and it did not take him long to find a nice smooth egg-shaped one that fitted his hand cosily. As a boy he used to practise throwing stones at things, until rabbits and squirrels, and even birds, got out of his way as quick as lightning if they saw him stoop; and even grownup he had still spent a deal of his time at quoits, dart-throwing, shooting at the wand, bowls, ninepins and other quiet games of the aiming and throwing sort-indeed he could do lots of things, besides blowing smoke-rings, asking riddles and cooking, that I haven't had time to tell you about. There is no time now. While he was picking up stones, the spider had reached Bombur, and soon he would have been dead. At that moment Bilbo threw. The stone struck the spider plunk on the head, and it dropped senseless off the tree, flop to the ground, with all its legs curled up.</div>

When about fifty had gone off to the place where he had stood before, he threw some more stones at these, and at others that had stopped behind; then dancing among the trees he began to sing a song to infuriate them and bring them all after him, and also to let the dwarves hear his voice.</div>

They could not see Bilbo, but they could make a good guess at the direction from which the stones were coming.

As he sang he threw some more stones and stamped. Practically all the spiders in the place came after him: some dropped to the ground, others raced along the branches, swung from tree to tree, or cast new ropes across the dark spaces. They made for his noise far quicker than he had expected. They were frightfully angry. Quite apart from the stones no spider has ever liked being called Attercop, and Tomnoddy of course is insulting to anybody.</div>

The worst part of the job was getting up on to the long branch where the bundles were dangling.

He managed by leaning over to cut most of the strong sticky threads that bound him round, and then, sure enough, with a kick and a struggle most of Fili emerged.

<div class="line_cn" title="“不是菲力就是奇力。”他从蛛网边缘冒出来的蓝色帽尖推测。接着，根据从错综的蛛丝间伸出的长鼻子，他进一步判断道：“应该是菲力吧！”他把身子凑了上去，把缠住他的大部分又黏又韧的蛛丝割断，然后，果然，一踢一挣之后，菲力从蛛丝捆里探出了大半个身子。菲力伸展蹬动着麻木的双臂与双腿，拼命从胳肢窝下的蛛丝中挣脱着，估计比尔博看见这番景象一定笑了出来，因为这实在是太像用线提着的木偶娃娃在跳滑稽舞了。">查看中文翻译</div>

Well, between them they started to haul up first one dwarf and then another and slash them free. None of them were better off than Fili, and some of them were worse.

<div class="line_en">There they lay for some time, puffing and panting. But very soon they began to ask questions. They had to have the whole vanishing business carefully explained, and the finding of the ring interested them so much that for a while they forgot their own troubles. Balin in particular insisted on having the Gollum story, riddles and all, told all over again, with the ring in its proper place. But after a time the light began to fail, and then other questions were asked. Where were they, and where was their path, and where was there any food, and what were they going to do next? These questions they asked over and over again, and it was from little Bilbo that they seemed to expect to get the answers. From which you can see that they had changed their opinion of Mr. Baggins very much, and had begun to have a great respect for him (as Gandalf had said they would). Indeed they really expected him to think of some wonderful plan for helping them, and were not merely grumbling. They knew only too well that they would soon all have been dead, if it had not been for the hobbit; and they thanked him many times. Some of them even got up and bowed right to the ground before him, though they fell over with the effort, and could not get on their legs again for some time. Knowing the truth about the vanishing did not lessen their opinion of Bilbo at all; for they saw that he had some wits, as well as luck and a magic ring-and all three are very useful possessions. In fact they praised him so much that Bilbo began to feel there really was something of a bold adventurer about himself after all, though he would have felt a lot bolder still, if there had been anything to eat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们在那里躺了一会儿，呼哧呼哧地喘着大气。但他们马上就开始好奇地提问了。他们让比尔博详细解释凭空消失是怎么回事，他找到戒指的经过让他们非常感兴趣，以至于让他们一时间忘记了自己的麻烦。巴林对此尤其有兴趣，缠着比尔博要他把咕噜的故事，包括猜谜语的详情和关于戒指的细节都再讲一遍。但过了一会儿之后，身边的绿光开始转暗，这时他们才想起问一些别的问题：这里到底是哪儿？原先的小径在何处？该到哪里去找些食物？接下来又该怎么办？他们一遍遍地问着这些问题，似乎期待着能从小比尔博那里得到回答。从这一点上你们就可以看出来，矮人们对于巴金斯先生的看法已经完全改变了，开始对他表现出了极大的尊敬（甘道夫早就说过会有这一天的）。他们真的认为他会想出好的计划来帮他们脱离困境，而不是窝在这里一味抱怨。他们心里明白得很，要不是霍比特人舍命相救，他们撑不了多久就没命了。他们对他谢了又谢，有几个矮人甚至站起身来，要给他来个九十度的鞠躬，结果因为腿软而倒在地上，一时之间爬不起来。尽管他们知道了神秘消失的真相，却一点也没有减少对比尔博的敬意，因为他们都明白，比尔博不仅有好运气和一枚魔法戒指，还相当有急智——这三样可都是非常有用的东西。事实上，他们对于比尔博的称赞，让他也开始觉得自己真是个伟大的冒险者，尽管如果能有点东西吃的话，他还能变得更勇敢些。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a terrible shock. Of course there were only thirteen of them, twelve dwarves and the hobbit. Where indeed was Thorin? They wondered what evil fate had befallen him, magic or dark monsters; and shuddered as they lay lost in the forest. There they dropped off one by one into uncomfortable sleep full of horrible dreams, as evening wore to black night; and there we must leave them for the present, too sick and weary to set guards or to take turns at watching.</div>

<div class="line_en">But there was nothing, nothing at all; and none of them were fit to go and look for anything, or to search for the lost path. The lost path! No other idea would come into Bilbo's tired head. He just sat staring in front of him at the endless trees; and after a while they all fell silent again. All except Balin. Long after the others had stopped talking and shut their eyes, he kept on muttering and chuckling to himself.</div>

<div class="line_en">The feasting people were Wood-elves, of course. These are not wicked folk. If they have a fault it is distrust of strangers. Though their magic was strong, even in those days they were wary. They differed from the High Elves of the West, and were more dangerous and less wise. For most of them (together with their scattered relations in the hills and mountains) were descended from the ancient tribes that never went to Faerie in the West. There the Light-elves and the Deep-elves and the Sea-elves went and lived for ages, and grew fairer and wiser and more learned, and invented their magic and their cunning craft in the making of beautiful and marvellous things, before some came back into the Wide World. In the Wide World the Wood-elves lingered in the twilight of our Sun and Moon, but loved best the stars; and they wandered in the great forests that grew tall in lands that are now lost. They dwelt most often by the edges of the woods, from which they could escape at times to hunt, or to ride and run over the open lands by moonlight or starlight; and after the coming of Men they took ever more and more to the gloaming and the dusk. Still elves they were and remain, and that is Good People.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当然，在林中宴饮的正是这些精灵。他们并不是什么坏家伙，如果说他们有什么缺点的话，那就是不信任陌生人。即便拥有很强的魔法，可在这些日子里他们还是非常小心翼翼。他们和西方的高等精灵不同，更具危险性，也没那么聪明。他们之中的大多数（加上他们散居于大小山脉间的亲族），都是从没有去过西方圣土的那些古老部族传承下来的。那些光明精灵、渊博精灵和海洋精灵，都去过西方圣土，并在那儿住了很多年，变得更美丽、更智慧、更博学，并且发明出他们自己的魔法，研究出如何制造美丽和神奇东西的技术，然后他们之中的一部分才重新回到这个世界来。在这个世界中，森林精灵在太阳和月亮的光华间游走，但他们最爱的还是星辰。他们会在今日早已绝迹的壮阔森林中漫游，且大多数居住在森林的边缘，在那里，他们有时进入森林狩猎，有时则在月光或是星光下驰骋于平原之上。在人类到来之后，他们越来越不喜欢光天化日了，不过，他们依旧是精灵，是善良的种族。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Thorin had been caught much faster than they had. You remember Bilbo falling like a log into sleep, as he stepped into a circle of light? The next time it had been Thorin who stepped forward, and as the lights went out he fell like a stone enchanted. All the noise of the dwarves lost in the night, their cries as the spiders caught them and bound them, and all the sounds of the battle next day, had passed over him unheard. Then the Wood-elves had come to him, and bound him, and carried him away.</div>

<div class="line_en">In a great cave some miles within the edge of Mirkwood on its eastern side there lived at this time their greatest king. Before his huge doors of stone a river ran out of the heights of the forest and flowed on and out into the marshes at the feet of the high wooded lands. This great cave, from which countless smaller ones opened out on every side, wound far underground and had many passages and wide halls; but it was lighter and more wholesome than any goblin-dwelling, and neither so deep nor so dangerous. In fact the subjects of the king mostly lived and hunted in the open woods, and had houses or huts on the ground and in the branches. The beeches were their favourite trees. The king's cave was his palace, and the strong place of his treasure, and the fortress of his people against their enemies.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在距黑森林的东部边缘几哩之处有一座巨大的洞穴，此时里面居住着他们最伟大的国王。在他巨大的石门前，一道来自森林高地的河流蜿蜒而下，流进林木葱茏的平原旁的湿地。这个巨大的洞穴，在其每一边都有着数不尽的小洞穴，一直绵延到远处的地下，里面有许多通道和宽阔的厅堂。这地底世界远比半兽人居住的地方要亮堂、干净，没有那么幽深，也没那么危险。事实上，国王的臣民大多在森林中居住狩猎，他们居住的屋子多半在地面上或树枝间。山毛榉是他们最喜欢的树。国王的洞穴是他的宫殿，也是他收藏宝物的地方，更是他的同胞们对抗外敌的堡垒。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was also the dungeon of his prisoners. So to the cave they dragged Thorin-not too gently, for they did not love dwarves, and thought he was an enemy. In ancient days they had had wars with some of the dwarves, whom they accused of stealing their treasure. It is only fair to say that the dwarves gave a different account, and said that they only took what was their due, for the elf-king had bargained with them to shape his raw gold and silver, and had afterwards refused to give them their pay. If the elf-king had a weakness it was for treasure, especially for silver and white gems; and though his hoard was rich, he was ever eager for more, since he had not yet as great a treasure as other elf-lords of old. His people neither mined nor worked metals or jewels, nor did they bother much with trade or with tilling the earth. All this was well known to every dwarf, though Thorin's family had had nothing to do with the old quarrel I have spoken of. Consequently Thorin was angry at their treatment of him, when they took their spell off him and he came to his senses; and also he was determined that no word of gold or jewels should be dragged out of him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这里也是他们关押囚犯的地牢。因此，他们将索林拖来了此处——态度不算太客气，因为他们不喜欢矮人，并且认为他是敌人。在古代，他们曾经指控有些矮人偷盗他们的宝藏，并且与他们进行了战争。不过这事儿要是不听听矮人们给出的不同说法便算不上公平。据他们的说法他们只是拿回了他们应得的东西，因为精灵国王和他们谈好了工钱，要求他们帮他打造金银器，可过后却拒绝付给他们报酬。如果说精灵国王有什么弱点的话，那一定是对财宝的贪恋，尤其是对白银和白色的宝石。虽然他已经收藏了许多的宝物，但他还是永不满足，因为他的宝藏还比不上其他远古精灵贵族那样丰富。他的子民不会开矿，也不会铸造金属或是打造珠宝，更懒得花工夫去做买卖或是种地。每个矮人都知道精灵与矮人的这段过节，虽然索林的祖先与之一点关系也没有。因此，当身上的魔法被解除，索林苏醒过来之后，他对于精灵们的态度很是气愤，他拿定主意，他们休想从他口中获得关于金子或珠宝的一个字儿。">查看中文翻译</div>
