<div class="line_en">Vail's threat of suicide had been the trigger for this meeting. If carried out, the rights to his novel would revert to his former wife and her children, and Molly Flanders would drive a hard bargain. Nobody believed in the threat, not even Claudia, but Bobby Bantz and Eli Marrion, operating from their knowledge of what they would do for money, always had to worry.</div>

<div class="line_en">When Claudia, Ernest, and Molly arrived at LoddStone, they found only Bobby Bantz in the executive suite. He looked uncomfortable, though he tried to disguise it with effusive greetings, especially to Vail. "Our National Treasure," he said and hugged Ernest with respectful affection.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克劳迪娅、厄内斯特和茉莉来到罗德斯通，发现行政套房里只有鲍比·邦茨。他看上去很不自然，但他和众人打招呼试图掩盖这一点，尤其是对维尔。“我们的国宝。”他热情洋溢地拥抱了厄内斯特。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Claudia was determined to cash in on her sexual marker with Eli Marrion; she would shame him into giving Ernest Vail the points he wanted on his novel. It was a long shot, but she was willing to compromise her principles. Bobby Bantz was implacable on gross points, but Eli Marrion was unpredictable and had a soft spot for her. Besides, it was an honorable custom in the movie business that sexual congress, no matter how brief, demanded a certain material courtesy.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="邦茨对茉莉说：“这样，五年的合同，每周一万美元，做原创剧本，也会做点儿改编工作。当然啦，原创剧本我们肯定是有优先采用权。每次做改编的时候每周都多加五万。五年的话，他挣的也差不多一千万了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="车窗的茶色玻璃把整个城市都染成了一片昏黄，像老西部片的画面。越往市中心走，楼宇就越高，仿佛他们正在一片石林中穿行。克劳迪娅对此总是觉得不可思议。刚才还是四野绿草如茵的小镇，十分钟的路，竟然就变成了混凝土和玻璃的繁华都市了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">These suites had huge carved black oak doors that reached from floor to ceiling, with shiny brass knobs. The doors opened like gates, to a suite of a hospital bedroom, a larger, open-walled room with dining table and chairs, a sofa and lounge chairs, and a secretarial niche that held a computer and fax. There was also a small kitchen space and guest bathroom in addition to the bathroom for the patient. The ceiling was very high and the absence of walls between the kitchen niche, the living room area, and the business nook gave the whole room the look of a movie set.</div>

<div class="line_en">Vail was enjoying himself. After all, he had won his fight against the Studio, he had his points. "Claudia, I really agree," he said. "Movies are art. I complain out of envy. Movies are making novels irrelevant. What's the point of writing a lyrical passage about nature, painting the world in red heat, a beautiful sunset, a mountain range coated with snow, the awe-inspiring waves of great oceans." He was declaiming, waving his arms. "What can you write about passion and the beauty of women? What's the use of all that when you can see it on the movie screen in Technicolor? Oh, those mysterious women with full red lips, their magical eyes, when you can see them bare-assed, tits as delicious-looking as beef Wellington. All much better than real life even, never mind prose. And how can we write about the amazing deeds of heroes who slay their enemies by the hundred, who conquer great odds and great temptation, when you can get it all in gouts of blood before your eyes, tortured, agonized faces on the screen. Actors and cameras doing all the work without processing through the brain. Sly Stallone as Achilles in the Iliad. Now the one thing the screen can't do is get into the minds of their characters, it cannot duplicate the thinking process, the complexity of life." He paused for a moment, then said wistfully, "But you know what's worst of all? I'm an elitist. I wanted to be an artist to be something special. So what I hate is that movies are such a democratic art. Anybody can make a movie. You're right, Claudia, I've seen movies that moved me to tears and I know for a fact that the people who made them are moronic, insensitive, uneducated, and with not an iota of morality. The screenwriter is illiterate, the director an egomaniac, the producer a butcher of morality and the actors smash their fists into the wall or a mirror to show the audience they are upset. But then the movie works. How can that be? Because a movie uses sculpture, painting, music, human bodies, and technology to form itself, while a novelist only has a string of words, black print on white paper. And to tell the truth that's not so terrible. That's progress. And the new great art. A democratic art. And art without suffering. Just buy the right camera and meet with your friends."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="维尔很快活。毕竟跟工作室这场仗他打赢了，拿到了分成。“克劳迪娅，我的确同意。”他说，“电影是艺术。我这是出于嫉妒才抱怨的。电影让小说变得无关紧要了。用抒情的文字描写大自然还有什么意义呢？美丽的夕阳、积雪覆盖的山峦、一碧万顷的大海，还写这些干什么呢？”他挥舞着双手滔滔不绝，“激情火热的世界和女人的美，你还能写些什么？你既然都在电影里看见了，都在彩色大银幕上了，写它还有什么用？啊，谜一般的女子，火热的红唇，散发着魔力的眼神，还有她们光溜溜的屁股，嫩得像威灵顿牛排一样的大胸脯，看到这些不就够了吗？这些全都比现实生活都要精彩多了，更不用说比散文了。还有，那些英雄事迹我们怎么写？战胜了一切艰难和诱惑英雄事迹，你全都看得见，大银幕把大量的血浆和因折磨而扭曲的脸直接展现给观众了。这些事情演员和摄像机全都替你办到了，根本不用费脑子去想。你看斯莱·史泰龙，就跟《伊利亚特》里的阿喀琉斯一样。大银幕唯一做不到的事情，就是深入角色的思想中去，电影没有办法复制思维过程的，也没有没法复制生活的复杂性。”他顿了顿，又愁苦地说，“可你们知道最最悲哀的地方是什么吗？我是个精英主义者。我之所以想要成为一个艺术家，就是因为我想要做出与众不同的东西来。所以我最恨最恨的是，电影是个民主的艺术。谁都可以拍电影。克劳迪娅，你说得对，我的确看电影流泪过。问题是有件事情我清楚得很，这些做电影的人都是一群白痴，他们没有感情和教养，连一点点最起码的道德感都没有。编剧写出来的东西狗屁不通，导演都是自大狂，制片人简直就是道德的刽子手，演员呢？让他们表演焦虑不安，他们就只懂得拿拳头捶墙、砸镜子。问题是，这样的确就能拍出电影了。怎么能拍出来呢？因为电影把雕塑、绘画、音乐、人体、科技全都用在它自己身上了，可小说家呢？只有一串文字组合而已，除了黑墨水就是白稿纸。不过说实话，没那么糟。这是一种进程，这是一种伟大的新艺术。一种群众性的艺术。而且创作这种艺术完全不用体会痛苦。去买部摄像机、找一帮朋友，你的电影就成了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

So you're down to twenty mil. Then they deduct the cost of making prints, the cost for advertising the picture, which could easily be another five. You're down to fifteen. Now here's the beauty. By contract, the studio gets twenty-five percent of the budget for studio overhead, telephone bills, electricity, use of soundstages etc. Now you're down to eleven. Good, you say. You'll take your piece of eleven million. But the Bankable Star gets at least five percent of the rentals, the director and producer another five percent. So that comes to another five million. You're down to six million. At last you'll get something. But not so fast. They then charge you all the costs of distribution, they charge fifty grand for delivering the prints to the English market, another fifty to France or Germany. And then finally they charge the interest on the fifteen million they borrowed to make the picture. And there they lose me. But that last six million disappears.

<div class="line_en">The fax machine stilled its stutter, and Marrion could feel the fluttering of his failing heart. Early morning light filled his room. He saw the nurse flick off her lamp and close her book. It was so lonely to die with only this stranger in this room when he was loved by so many powerful people. Then the nurse was prying open his eyelids, putting her stethoscope to his chest. The huge doors to his hospital suite opened like the great door of some ancient temple and he could hear the rattling of dishes on the breakfast trays…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="传真机还在响。马林听见自己疲惫不堪的心跳声。清晨的阳光洒进他的房间，他看到护士关了台灯合上书。要死了，真是孤独啊，有那么多了不起的人爱他，临死的时候屋子里却只有这个陌生人。护士扒开他的眼皮，把听诊器放在他的胸口。病房的门像上古神庙的大门一样推开了，他听见早餐托盘和碟子碰撞，发出叮当的响声…">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then the room filled with bright lights. He could feel fists thumping his chest and wondered why they were doing this to him. A cloud was forming in his brain, filling it with mist. Through that mist voices were screaming. A line from a movie penetrated his oxygen-starved brain. "Is this how the Gods die?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="屋子一下子明亮起来。他感觉到有人在用拳头捶打他的胸口，他奇怪这些人到底在干什么。一层迷云覆上了他的脑海，一阵尖叫声穿过了这层密云。某部电影里的台词突然涌进了他已经缺氧的脑中：“众神也是这样死去的吧？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">All of Hollywood would mourn but none more than the night duty nurse, Priscilla. She had done a double shift because she supported two small children, and it displeased her that Marrion had died on her shift. She prided herself on her reputation as one of the finest nurses in California. She hated death. But the book she had been reading had excited her and she had been planning how to talk with Marrion about making it into a movie. She would not be a nurse forever, she was a screenwriter on the side. Now she did not give up hope. This top floor of the hospital with its huge suites received the greatest men of Hollywood and she would stand guard for them against death forever.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="整个好莱坞都会哀恸不已，但是谁也没有夜班护士普瑞希拉更悲伤。为了养活两个小孩，她不得不值夜班，马林恰好就死在了她的夜班里。她一直被誉为全加利福尼亚最好的护士，这让她骄傲不已。她讨厌死亡。但是她刚刚读的那本书太精彩了，她还想着要跟马林谈谈，把这本书改编成电影呢。她不会一辈子都当护士的，她闲暇时候还是个编剧。不过就算现在她也没有放弃希望。这间医院顶楼的豪华病房里住的都是好莱坞最大的人物，她会守护着他们，防止死神来袭。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In reality, the nurse had gone to his bed some fifteen minutes after he was dead, so quietly had he died. She debated for maybe thirty seconds about calling an alert to try to bring him back to life. She was an old hand with death and more merciful. Why try to revive him to all the torture of reclaiming life? She went to the window and watched the sun rise and the pigeons strutting lustfully on the stone ledges. Priscilla was the final power deciding Marrion's fate… and his most merciful judge.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="实际上，他死了十五分钟之后，护士才走到他的床前。他静悄悄地离开了。她想了半分钟到底要不要采取急救手段唤回他的生命。对死亡她司空见惯了，因此有了更多的怜悯。唤回他的生命只能让他继续忍受折磨。她走到窗边，看太阳升起，看石阶上踱着方步的鸽子。普瑞希拉是马林命运的最后裁决…也是对他最为悲悯的法官。">查看中文翻译</div>
