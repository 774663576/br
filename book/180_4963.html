<div class="line_en">"Mrs Ramsay!" Lily cried, "Mrs Ramsay!" But nothing happened. The pain increased. That anguish could reduce one to such a pitch of imbecility, she thought! Anyhow the old man had not heard her. He remained benignant, calm -- if one chose to think it, sublime. Heaven be praised, no one had heard her cry that ignominious cry, stop pain, stop! She had not obviously taken leave of her senses. No one had seen her step off her strip of board into the waters of annihilation. She remained a skimpy old maid, holding a paint-brush.</div>

<div class="line_en">And now slowly the pain of the want, and the bitter anger (to be called back, just as she thought she would never feel sorrow for Mrs Ramsay again. Had she missed her among the coffee cups at breakfast? not in the least) lessened; and of their anguish left, as antidote, a relief that was balm in itself, and also, but more mysteriously, a sense of some one there, of Mrs Ramsay, relieved for a moment of the weight that the world had put on her, staying lightly by her side and then (for this was Mrs Ramsay in all her beauty) raising to her forehead a wreath of white flowers with which she went. Lily squeezed her tubes again. She attacked that problem of the hedge. It was strange how clearly she saw her, stepping with her usual quickness across fields among whose folds, purplish and soft, among whose flowers, hyacinth or lilies, she vanished. It was some trick of the painter's eye. For days after she had heard of her death she had seen her thus, putting her wreath to her forehead and going unquestioningly with her companion, a shade across the fields. The sight, the phrase, had its power to console. Wherever she happened to be, painting, here, in the country or in London, the vision would come to her, and her eyes, half closing, sought something to base her vision on. She looked down the railway carriage, the omnibus; took a line from shoulder or cheek; looked at the windows opposite; at Piccadilly, lamp-strung in the evening. All had been part of the fields of death. But always something -- it might be a face, a voice, a paper boy crying STANDARD, NEWS -- thrust through, snubbed her, waked her, required and got in the end an effort of attention, so that the vision must be perpetually remade. Now again, moved as she was by some instinctive need of distance and blue, she looked at the bay beneath her, making hillocks of the blue spaces, again she was roused as usual by something incongruous. There was a brown spot in the middle of the bay. It was a boat. Yes, she realised that after a second. But whose boat? Mr Ramsay's boat, she replied. Mr Ramsay; the man who had marched past her, with his hand raised, aloof, at the head of a procession, in his beautiful boots, asking her for sympathy, which she had refused. The boat was now half way across the bay.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时渴求的痛苦和强烈的愤怒（正当她觉得她永远不要再为拉姆齐夫人感到悲哀的时候，却又被召唤起了这份感情。早餐时面对着那些咖啡杯她想念拉姆齐夫人了吗？一点也没有）慢慢减轻了；悲伤后的宽慰是解毒剂，本身就是止痛的良药，同时更为神秘的是，她感觉到有一个人在场，是拉姆齐夫人，暂时摆脱了这个世界加在她身上的重负，轻快地站在她的身边（因为这确实就是绝美的拉姆齐夫人），然后把去世时戴的白色花环举到额头。莉莉又一次挤出了几种颜料。她着手对付那片树篱。很奇怪她这样清楚地看到了她，带着平日的轻快步伐穿过田野，消失在淡紫色柔和起伏的田地中，消失在遍地的风信子或百合花丛中。这是画家的眼睛在作弄她、听到拉姆齐夫人死讯后的许多天，她都看见她像这个样子，把花环戴在额头上，和她的伴侣，一个影子，确确实实地穿过田野而去。这个景象，这个片段，具有令人感到慰藉的力量。无论她在哪里画画，在此处乡间或在伦敦，这个幻象都会来到她的眼前，她就会半闭着眼睛为这个幻象寻找一个基点。她俯视着火车车厢，公共汽车；她沿肩膀或面颊取线；看着对面的窗户；看着夜里亮起串串灯光的皮卡迪里广场。这一切都曾是茫茫的死亡之野的一部分。但总有什么东西——可能是一张脸，一个声音，一个报童叫卖《旗帜报》、《新闻报》的声音——穿透这一片茫茫，喝止她、唤醒她，要求她并最后成功地使她集中注意力，因此这个幻象就不断需要重塑。现在又是如此，她被某种本能的对距离和蓝色的需求所驱使，她向下面的海湾看去，把条条蓝色的波浪看做小丘，把颜色更紫的空间看做多石的田野。和以前一样，一个不协调的东西引起了她的注意。在海湾中央有一个棕色的斑点。那是一条船。是的，她马上就意识到这一点。但是，是谁的船呢？拉姆齐先生的船，她答道。拉姆齐先生；那个举着手、神情冷漠、穿着漂亮的皮靴、率领着他的队伍、大踏步走过她身边的男人，他要求得到她的同情，而她拒绝给予他。那只船现在已经驶过了半个海湾。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Where are they now?" Lily thought, looking out to sea. Where was he, that very old man who had gone past her silently, holding a brown paper parcel under his arm? The boat was in the middle of the bay.</div>

<div class="line_en">So fine was the morning except for a streak of wind here and there that the sea and sky looked all one fabric, as if sails were stuck high up in the sky, or the clouds had dropped down into the sea. A steamer far out at sea had drawn in the air a great scroll of smoke which stayed there curving and circling decoratively, as if the air were a fine gauze which held things and kept them softly in its mesh, only gently swaying them this way and that. And as happens sometimes when the weather is very fine, the cliffs looked as if they were conscious of the ships, and the ships looked as if they were conscious of the cliffs, as if they signalled to each other some message of their own. For sometimes quite close to the shore, the Lighthouse looked this morning in the haze an enormous distance away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="早晨的天气非常好，只是偶尔吹过一丝微风。海天似乎浑然一体，船帆仿佛高挂在天空，云彩又仿佛落入了海中。遥远的海面上，一条轮船在空中画出一道浓烟，翻卷缭绕，久久不散，装点着这幅景色。空气仿佛是层薄纱，把万物轻柔地保存在它的网中，仅仅让它们轻轻地来回摆动。就像天气非常晴朗时常会发生的那样，悬崖似乎意识到了船只，船只也似乎意识到了悬崖，它们似乎互相发送着只有它们才理解的的秘密信号；因为有时灯塔似乎离海岸很近，但这天早晨在一片氤氲之中却显得非常遥远。">查看中文翻译</div>
