<div class="line_en">"I like being with her, I like talking with her. I'm fond of anybody I can talk to."

"I'll tell you one thing, I think your friend knows what she's doing. I think she's committing a crime against you. I've half a mind to report her to somebody, but the trouble is you're not a child.

<div class="line_en">"God!" Therese said. She felt like saying it a dozen times. It summed up everything, her imprisonment now, here, yet. "You don't understand." But he did, and that was why he was angry. But did he understand that she would have felt the same way if Carol had never touched her? Yes, and if Carol had never even spoken to her after that brief conversation about a doll's valise in the store. If Carol, in fact, had never spoken to her at all, for it had all happened in that instant she had seen Carol standing in the middle of the floor, watching her. Then the realization that so much had happened after that meeting made her feel incredibly lucky suddenly. It was so easy for a man and woman to find each other, to find someone who would do, but for her to have found Carol --"I think I understand you better than you understand me. You don't really want to see me again, either, because you said yourself I'm not the same person.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他说：“你不能就这样下命令要我离开你的生活。”他的两只长长的手臂挥动着，话中有落寞的语气，仿佛他已经走上了离开特芮丝的路程。“最让我难过的是，你表现得好像我一文不值，好像我完全没有用一样。小芮，这样对我不公平。我没办法跟她竞争！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Therese watched him, caught by the idea that had just come to her, that she knew suddenly was a fact. Why hadn't it occurred to her the night of the theater, days ago? She might have known it from a hundred gestures, words, looks, this past week. But she remembered the night of the theater especially -- he had surprised her with tickets to something she particularly wanted to see -- the way he had held her hand that night, and from his voice on the telephone, not just telling her to meet him here or there, but asking her very sweetly if she could. She hadn't liked it. It was not a manifestation of affection, but rather a means of ingratiating himself, of somehow paving the way for the sudden questions he had asked so casually that night, "What do you mean you're fond of her? Do you want to go to bed with her?" Therese had replied, "Do you think I would tell you if I did?" while a quick succession of emotions -- humiliation, resentment, loathing of him -- had made her speechless, had made it almost impossible for her to keep walking beside him. And glancing at him, she had seen him looking at her with that soft, inane smile that in memory now looked cruel, and unhealthy. And its unhealthiness might have escaped her, she thought, if it weren't that Richard was so frankly trying to convince her she was unhealthy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特芮丝看着他，想到刚刚才出现的想法，她突然了解这个想法就是事实。前几天在剧院时为什么没想到？透过上礼拜的几百个动作、言语、姿态和眼神，她早就应该知道了。但她记得在剧院那晚（他带给她一个惊喜，送她票去看一出她非常想看的戏），特别是他那天晚上握着她手的方式。还有他在电话里的语气。他不只是告诉她在何处碰面，而是非常温柔地问她能不能去。她不喜欢这样。这不是爱意的表达，反而像是为了讨他自己高兴，像是为了铺陈好那天晚上他看似不经意而突然的问题：“你说你喜欢她是什么意思？你想和她上床吗？”特芮丝回答：“要是我想的话，你认为我会告诉你吗？”之后一连串的情绪接踵而来——羞愤、憎恨、对他的厌恶。这些情绪令她说不出话来，让她几乎无法继续走在他身边。她看着他，她看到他望着她，脸上带着柔和、空洞的笑容。如今回想起来，这样的笑冷酷又病态。她想，要不是理查德直言不讳地说出她很病态，她可能不会想起理查德的笑容是多么病态。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">No, she thought, of course he couldn't. "I don't have any quarrel with you," she said. "It's you who choose to quarrel over Carol. She hasn't taken anything away from you, because you didn't have it in the first place. But if you can't go on seeing me --" She stopped, knowing he could and probably would go on seeing her.</div>

She could imagine the determination transformed to hatred and to violence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他盯着她看，在盛怒之下，特芮丝一度看到她之前看到过的那种固执的好奇心，仿佛他在从钥匙孔中窥探某种奇景。但她知道他没有那么超脱。相反，她感觉到他从来没有像现在这么在乎她，那么坚定地不愿放弃她。这让她觉得害怕，害怕理查德的决心会变成恨意，然后变成暴力。">查看中文翻译</div>

And at best, even doing the right thing, she could not make Carol happy as Carol made her happy, she thought as she had thought a hundred times before. Carol was happy only at moments here and there, moments that Therese caught and kept. One had been in the evening they put away the Christmas decorations, and Carol had refolded the string of angels and put them between the pages of a book. "I'm going to keep these," she had said. "With twenty-two angels to defend me, I can't lose."

She lay for a moment, watching the watery looking sunspots rippling on the pale green ceiling, listening for any sound of activity in the house. She looked at her blouse, hanging over the edge of the bureau. Why was she so untidy in Carol's house? Carol didn't like it. The dog that lived somewhere beyond the garages was barking intermittently, halfheartedly. There had been one pleasant interval last evening, the telephone call from Rindy. Rindy back from a birthday party at nine thirty. Could she give a birthday party on her birthday in April. Carol said of course. Carol had been different after that.

<div class="line_en">Therese got up and went to the window, raised it higher and leaned on the sill, tensing herself against the cold. There were no mornings anywhere like the mornings from this window. The round bed of grass beyond the driveway had darts of sunlight in it, like scattered gold needles. There were sparks of sun in the moist hedge leaves, and the sky was a fresh solid blue. She looked at the place in the driveway where Abby had been that morning, and at the bit of white fence beyond the hedges that marked the end of the lawn. The ground looked breathing and young, even though the winter had browned the grass. There had been trees and hedges around the school in Montclair, but the green had always ended in part of a red brick wall, or a gray stone building that was part of the school -- an infirmary, a woodshed, a toolhouse -- and the green each spring had seemed old already, used and handed down by one generation of children to the next, as much a part of school paraphernalia as textbooks and uniforms.</div>

<div class="line_en">Therese wished suddenly that she had brought Carol flowers, brought them on any of a half a dozen occasions past, and she remembered the flowers Dannie had brought to her one day when he simply dropped in at the theater. She looked at Harge, and his eyes glanced away from her, the peaked brow lifting still higher, the eyes darting everywhere, as if he looked for little changes in the room. But it might all be pretense, Therese thought, his air of good cheer. And if he cared enough to pretend he must also care in some way for Carol.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特芮丝突然希望自己也替卡罗尔带了花来，或者前几次见面的时候，曾经带过花来。她想起以前丹尼有天顺道经过剧院时进来送给她的花。她看着哈吉，他的眼睛避开她的目光，耸起的眉毛扬得更高了一点，眼睛到处张望，仿佛在寻找房间里的小变化。特芮丝想，他愉快的外表可能只是假装，如果他在乎到足以装腔作势的地步，那从某种程度上他也一定在乎卡罗尔。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Harge, this is Miss Belivet. I think you met her once," Carol said.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes. Very." Harge's tense smile did not show his teeth, but his face and the quick turns of his head radiated geniality and self-satisfaction.

<div class="line_en">She closed the door and looked around the room, realized she was looking for any sign that she had spent the night. There was none. She stopped at the mirror and looked at herself for a moment, frowningly. She was not so pale as she had been three weeks ago when Harge saw her, she did not feel like the drooping, frightened thing Harge had met then.
