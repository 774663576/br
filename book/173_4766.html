Like there was a law or something against doing anything but buying. Well, I reckon those eastern jews have got to live too. But I'll be damned if it hasn't come to a pretty pass when any dam foreigner that can't make a living in the country where God put him, can come to this one and take money right out of an American's pockets. It was up two points more. Four points. But hell, they were right there and knew what was going on. And if I wasn't going to take the advice, what was I paying them ten dollars a month for.

Mother stopped crying then. She pulled her veil down and we went down stairs. Uncle Maury was coming out of the diningroom, his handkerchief to his mouth.

While we were waiting there for them to start she says Thank God if he had to be taken too, it is you left me and not Quentin. Thank God you are not a Compson, because all I have left now is you and Maury and I says, Well I could spare Uncle Maury myself. Well, he kept on patting her hand with his black glove, talking away from her. He took them off when his turn with the shovel came. He got up near the first, where they were holding the umbrellas over them, stamping every now and then and trying to kick the mud off their feet and sticking to the shovels so they'd have to knock it off, making a hollow sound when it fell on it, and when I stepped back around the hack I could see him behind a tombstone, taking another one out of a bottle. I thought he never was going to stop because I had on my new suit too, but it happened that there wasn't much mud on the wheels yet, only Mother saw it and says I don't know when you'll ever have another one and Uncle Maury says,"Now, now. Don't you worry at all. You have me to depend on, always."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你是我唯一的希望了，”她说。“每天晚上，我都为你而感谢上帝。①当我们站在那儿等着大伙儿动身时，她说感谢上帝，如今父亲也不得不给带走，留在我身边的是你而不是昆丁。感谢上帝你脾气不象康普生家的人，因为我现在剩下的只有你和毛莱舅舅两个人了，这时候我对自己说，嗯，有没有毛莱舅舅我倒是一点也不在乎。哼，他一直用他的黑手套拍着她的手，一面跟她讲话，一面从她身边走开。轮到他铲土到墓穴里去时，他脱下手套。他走到第一批铲土的人的身边，有人给他们打着伞挡雨，时不时蹬蹬脚要把脚上的泥巴蹬掉，铁铲上粘满了泥上，因此他们只得把泥巴敲掉，泥巴落到棺材上时，发出了一种空荡荡的声音。当我退后几步站在那辆出租马车旁边时，我看见他躲在一块墓碑的后面，又从酒瓶里喝了一口酒。我还以为他要喝个没完了呢，因为我身上也穿了一套新西服，幸而马车轮子上那时候还没粘上多少泥巴，只有母亲看到了这一点，她说我可不知道你什么时候能再做一套新西服了，这时毛莱舅舅说，“得了，得了。你根本不用发愁，你不管什么时候都可以依靠我呢。”（注：①“感谢上帝”这句话使杰生的恩绪从接回小昆丁的那天转移到举行康普生先生葬仪的那天。）">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Well, I got to thinking about that and watching them throwing dirt into it, slapping it on anyway like they were making mortar or something or building a fence, and I began to feel sort of funny and so I decided to walk around a while. I thought that if I went toward town they'd catch up and be trying to make me get in one of them, so I went on back toward the nigger graveyard. I got under some cedars, where the rain didn't come much, only dripping now and then, where I could see when they got through and went away. After a while they were all gone and I waited a minute and came out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="且说我想着这件事情，看着人们把泥土往墓穴里扔，拍击着泥巴，象是在和灰泥。树栅栏似的，我觉得有点儿好玩了，便决心在附近逛一会儿。我想如果我往镇子的方向走，他们准会赶上我，一定会让我搭他们的一辆车，因此我就往后走，朝黑人的墓园走去。我来到几株杉树的下面，这儿雨比较稀，只是间或掉几滴下来，在这里我可以看见他们什么时候于完，什么时候动身回去。过了一会儿，他们全走了，我再等了一分钟才走出来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And we have. Always. The fourth letter was from him. But there wasn't any need to open it. I could have written it myself, or recited it to her from memory, adding ten dollars just to be safe. But I had a hunch about that other letter. I just felt that it was about time she was up to some of her tricks again. She got pretty wise after that first time. She found out pretty quick that I was a different breed of cat from Father. When they begun to get it filled up toward the top Mother started crying sure enough, so Uncle Maury got in with her and drove off. He says You can come in with somebody; they'll be glad to give you a lift. I'll have to take your mother on and I thought about saying, Yes you ought to brought two bottles instead of just one only I thought about where we were, so I let them go on. Little they cared how wet I got, because then Mother could have a whale of a time being afraid I was taking pneumonia.</div>

Then Mink said he'd have to take the team on back and so I said I'd buy him another cigar and so we drove into the lane and I went across the yard to the house. I stopped in the hall until I could hear Mother and Uncle Maury upstairs, then I went on back to the kitchen. She and Ben were there with Dilsey. I said Mother wanted her and I took her into the house. I found Uncle Maury's raincoat and put it around her and picked her up and went back to the lane and got in the hack. I told Mink to drive to the depot. He was afraid to pass the stable, so we had to go the back way and I saw her standing on the corner under the light and I told Mink to drive close to the walk and when I said Go on, to give the team a bat. Then I took the raincoat off of her and held her to the window and Caddy saw her and sort of jumped forward.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好的，”她说，“我听你的，”于是我告诉她到什么地方去等我，说完我就朝马车行走去。我加快了步子，就在他们正要把马匹从车子上卸下来的时候走到那儿。我问车钱算过没有，老板说还没有，于是我就说康普生太太忘了拿一样东西，还要用车，于是他们就让我坐上了车。赶车的是明克①。我买了一支雪茄敬他。我们赶着马车兜圈子，直到后街天色暗淡下来，人们在那儿看不出他了，这时明克说，他得把马儿赶回到车行去了，我就说，我待会儿再给他买一支雪茄，于是我们把车子赶进小巷，我穿过院子走进屋子。我在门厅里停住脚步，听到母亲与毛莱舅舅在楼上说话的声音，于是我朝后面走进了厨房。小昆丁与班在那里，迪尔西看着他们。我说母亲要让昆丁去一下，于是我抱着她走进屋子。我找到了毛莱舅舅的雨衣，把它裹在她身上，我抱起她回到小巷里坐上了马车。我让明克把车子赶到火车站去。他很怕在马车行门前经过，于是我们只好绕后街走。这时候我看见凯蒂站在路口街灯下，我就吩咐明克让车子挨近人行道走，等到我说“快走”时，给牲口抽上一鞭子。这时我把小昆丁身上的雨衣脱下来，把她举在马车窗前，凯蒂一看见她简直要往前扑过来。（注：①马车行里一个赶车的伙计。）">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And so I counted the money again that night and put it away, and I didn't feel so bad. I says I reckon that'll show you. I reckon you'll know now that you can't beat me out of a job and get away with it. It never occurred to me she wouldn't keep her promise and take that train. But I didn't know much about them then; I didn't have any more sense than to believe what they said, because the next morning dam if she didn't walk right into the store, only she had sense enough to wear the veil and not speak to anybody. It was Saturday morning, because I was at the store, and she came right on back to the desk where I was, walking fast.</div>

I says."Didn't I do everything I said? I said see her a minute, didn't I? Well, didn't you?" She just stood there looking at me, shaking like an ague-fit, her hands clenched and kind of jerking."I did just what I said I would," I says."You're the one that lied. You promised to take that train. Didn't you? Didn't you promise? If you think you can get that money back, just try it," I says."If it'd been a thousand dollars, you'd still owe me after the risk I took.

Like I say I can stand lots of things I don't expect much from them but if I have to work all day long in a dam store dam if I don't think I deserve a little peace and quiet to eat dinner in.

I believed folks when they said they'd do things. I've learned better since. Besides, like I say I guess I don't need any man's help to get along I can stand on my own feet like I always have. Then all of a sudden I thought of Dilsey and Uncle Maury. I thought how she'd get around Dilsey and that Uncle Maury would do anything for ten dollars. And there I was, couldn't even get away from the store to protect my own Mother. Like she says, if one of you had to be taken, thank God it was you left me I can depend on you and I says well I don't reckon I'll ever get far enough from the store to get out of your reach.

<div class="line_en">As it so happens, I am not quite in a position to avail myself of this opportunity to the uttermost which it warrants, but rather than go out of the family to do so, I am today drawing upon your Mother's bank for the small sum necessary to complement my own initial investment, for which I herewith enclose, as a matter of formality, my note of hand at eight percent, per annum. Needless to say, this is merely a formality, to secure your Mother in the event of that circumstance of which man is ever the plaything and sport. For naturally I shall employ this sum as though it were my own and so permit your Mother to avail herself of this opportunity which my exhaustive investigation has shown to be a bonanza -- if you will permit the vulgarism -- of the first water and purest ray serene.</div>

And knowing your Mother's delicate health and that timorousness which such delicately nurtured Southern ladies would naturally feel regarding matters of business, and their charming proneness to divulge unwittingly such matters in conversation, I would suggest that you do not mention it to her at all. On second thought, I advise you not to do so. It might be better to simply restore this sum to the bank at some future date, say, in a lump sum with the other small sums for which I am indebted to her, and say nothing about it at all. It is our duty to shield her from the crass material world as much as possible.</div>

<div class="line_en">Well, just about that time I happened to look up the alley and saw her. When I stepped back and looked at my watch I didn't notice at the time who he was because I was looking at the watch. It was just two thirty, fortyfive minutes before anybody but me expected her to be out. So when I looked around the door the first thing I saw was the red tie he had on and I was thinking what the hell kind of a man would wear a red tie. But she was sneaking along the alley, watching the door, so I wasn't thinking anything about him until they had gone past. I was wondering if she'd have so little respect for me that she'd not only play out of school when I told her not to, but would walk right past the store, daring me not to see her. Only she couldn't see into the door because the sun fell straight into it and it was like trying to see through an automobile searchlight, so I stood there and watched her go on past, with her face painted up like a dam clown's and her hair all gummed and twisted and a dress that if a woman had come out doors even on Gayoso or Beale street when I was a young fellow with no more than that to cover her legs and behind, she'd been thrown in jail. I'll be damned if they don't dress like they were trying to make every man they passed on the street want to reach out and clap his hand on it. And so I was thinking what kind of a dam man would wear a red tie when all of a sudden I knew he was one of those show folks well as if she'd told me. Well, I can stand a lot; if I couldn't dam if I wouldn't be in a hell of a fix, so when they turned the corner I jumped down and followed. Me, without any hat, in the middle of the afternoon, having to chase up and down back alleys because of my mother's good name. Like I say you can't do anything with a woman like that, if she's got it in her. If it's in her blood, you can't do anything with her. The only thing you can do is to get rid of her, let her go on and live with her own sort.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="好，就在这个时候，我偶然抬起头来朝小巷里望去，一眼看见了她。我倒退一步，看看我的表，这时我没注意旁边那个男的是谁，因为我正在看表。这时还只有两点三十分，比人们预料一我当然不在此例一她会从学校出来的时候早四十五分钟。我眼光朝门外扫过去，首先映入我眼帘的是他身上的那条红领带。我当时想，打红领带的究竟是何等路数的人呢。可是因为这时地正一边盯着店门，一边沿着小巷的墙根蹑手蹑脚地溜过去，所以我当时还来不及考虑这男的是什么人。我在想，她眼里真是一点也没有我了，我叫她上学，她偏要逃学，不仅如此，她居然还敢从店门走过，也不怕我会看见她。只是她看不见店里的情形，因为太陽正好对准了朝店里照，要看它就跟看汽车的车头灯光一样晃眼，因此我躲在门里瞧她走过，她那张脸涂抹得象猢狲屁股一样，她的头发用什么粘滋滋的油抹过，梳成了个怪发型。在我年轻那会儿，要是有个女人穿了这么短几乎遮不住大腿和屁股的裙子到外面来，即使是在声名狼藉的盖约苏街或比尔街①上，也会给抓起来的。老实说，女人穿这种衣服。目的就是让街上过往的男人看了都忍不住要伸出手去摸一把。我正冥思苦想，在琢磨究竟是哪一号人才会打红领带，忽然恍然大悟，这不就是戏班子里的一个戏子吗，这事我可以说是拿稳了。就跟她亲口告诉我的一样。哼，我这人是能屈能伸的；如果我不是有时能把一口气忍下去，那我这人还不定今天会怎样了呢，因此，等他们一拐弯，我马上跳出店门跟踪起来。我连帽子都没戴，在大白天居然在后街小巷里钉别人的梢，这可完全是为了维护我母亲的名誉啊，我早就说过，如果一个女人胎里坏，那你是没有办法的。如果她血液里有下贱的根子，那你怎么拉也拉她不起来。惟一的办法就是把她甩开，让她跟臭味相投的人泡在一起，死活由她去。（注：①孟菲斯的两条街，曾是下等娱乐场所集中之处。）">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After a while he got up to the car and when I finally got it through his head if two people in a ford had passed him, he said yes. So I went on, and when I came to where the wagon road turned off I could see the tire tracks. Ab Russell was in his lot, but I didn't bother to ask him and I hadn't got out of sight of his barn hardly when I saw the ford. They had tried to hide it. Done about as well at it as she did at everything else she did. Like I say it's not that I object to so much; maybe she can't help that, it's because she hasn't even got enough consideration for her own family to have any discretion.

I've done what I could; a man that can live as long as I have and not know when to quit is a fool. Especially as it's no business of mine. If it was my own daughter now it would be different, because she wouldn't have time to; she'd have to work some to feed a few invalids and idiots and niggers, because how could I have the face to bring anybody there. I've too much respect for anybody to do that.

But I'll be gone soon and then you can take a wife but you'll never find a woman who is worthy of you and I says yes I could. You'd get right up out of your grave you know you would.

<div class="line_en">The band was playing again, a loud fast tune, like they were breaking up. I reckon they'd be satisfied now. Maybe they'd have enough music to entertain them while they drove fourteen or fifteen miles home and unharnessed in the dark and fed the stock and milked. All they'd have to do would be to whistle the music and tell the jokes to the live stock in the barn, and then they could count up how much they'd made by not taking the stock to the show too. They could figure that if a man had five children and seven mules, he cleared a quarter by taking his family to the show. Just like that. Earl came back with a couple of packages.</div>

It hadn't been four months since Christmas, and yet they were almost as thick as ever. I reckon Parson Walthall was getting a belly full of them now. You'd have thought we were shooting people, with him making speeches and even holding onto a man's gun when they came over. Talking about peace on earth good will toward all and not a sparrow can fall to earth. But what does he care how thick they get, he hasn't got anything to do: what does he care what time it is. He pays no taxes, he doesn't have to see his money going every year to have the courthouse clock cleaned to where it'll run. They had to pay a man fortyfive dollars to clean it. I counted over a hundred half-hatched pigeons on the ground. You'd think they'd have sense enough to leave town. It's a good thing I don't have anymore ties than a pigeon, I'll say that.</div>

You can't even sit in the courthouse yard for them. First thing you know, bing. Right on your hat. But it would take a millionaire to afford to shoot them at five cents a shot. If they'd just put a little poison out there in the square, they'd get rid of them in a day, because if a merchant can't keep his stock from running around the square, he'd better try to deal in something besides chickens, something that don't eat, like plows or onions. And if a man don't keep his dogs up, he either don't want it or he hasn't any business with one.

<div class="line_en">A lot Job cared whether the wheel came off or not, long as he wouldn't have too far to walk back. Like I say the only place for them is in the field, where they'd have to work from sunup to sundown. They can't stand prosperity or an easy job. Let one stay around white people for a while and he's not worth killing. They get so they can outguess you about work before your very eyes, like Roskus the only mistake he ever made was he got careless one day and died. Shirking and stealing and giving you a little more lip and a little more lip until some day you have to lay them out with a scantling or something. Well, it's Earl's business. But I'd hate to have my business advertised over this town by an old doddering nigger and a wagon that you thought every time it turned a corner it would come all to pieces.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="只要路不太远徒步能走回来，约伯才不管轮子会不会掉下来呢。我早就说了，黑人唯一配待的地方就是大田，在那儿他们得从日出干到日落。让他们生活富裕点或工作轻松点，他们就会浑身不自在。让一个黑鬼在白人身边待的时间稍长了一些，这黑鬼就要报废了。他们会变得比你还诡，能在你眼皮底下耍奸卖滑，猜透你的心思。罗斯库司就是这样的一个，他所犯的惟一错误就是有一天一不小心居然让自己死了。偷懒，手脚不干净，嘴也越来越刁越来越刁直到最后你只好用一根木棒或是别的什么家伙来把他们压下去。哼，反正那是艾尔的事。不过要是我。我可不喜欢让一个老黑鬼赶着辆破车满城走砸我字号的招牌，这辆马车让人提心吊胆，总以为拐一个弯它就会散架。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One of the wheels was just about to come off. I watched to see if he'd get out of the alley before it did. Just turn any vehicle over to a nigger, though. I says that old rattletrap's just an eyesore, yet you'll keep it standing there in the carriage house a hundred years just so that boy can ride to the cemetery once a week. I says he's not the first fellow that'll have to do things he doesn't want to. I'd make him ride in that car like a civilised man or stay at home. What does he know about where he goes or what he goes in, and us keeping a carriage and a horse so he can take a ride on Sunday afternoon.</div>

<div class="line_en">I drove on home. There were no lights in the house yet, but they'd all be looking out the windows, and Dilsey jawing away in the kitchen like it was her own food she was having to keep hot until I got there. You'd think to hear her that there wasn't but one supper in the world, and that was the one she had to keep back a few minutes on my account. Well at least I could come home one time without finding Ben and that nigger hanging on the gate like a bear and a monkey in the same cage. Just let it come toward sundown and he'd head for the gate like a cow for the barn, hanging onto it and bobbing his head and sort of moaning to himself. That's a hog for punishment for you. If what had happened to him for fooling with open gates had happened to me, I never would want to see another one. I often wondered what he'd be thinking about, down there at the gate, watching the girls going home from school, trying to want something he couldn't even remember he didn't and couldn't want any longer. And what he'd think when they'd be undressing him and he'd happen to take a look at himself and begin to cry like he'd do. But like I say they never did enough of that. I says I know what you need you need what they did to Ben then you'd behave. And if you don't know what that was I says, ask Dilsey to tell you.</div>

When they began to sell the land to send Quentin to Harvard I told your father that he must make an equal provision for you. Then when Herbert offered to take you into the bank I said, Jason is provided for now, and when all the expense began to pile up and I was forced to sell our furniture and the rest of the pasture, I wrote her at once because I said she will realise that she and Quentin have had their share and part of Jason's too and that it depends on her now to compensate him. I said she will do that out of respect for her father. I believed that, then. But I'm just a poor old woman; I was raised to believe that people would deny themselves for their own flesh and blood. It's my fault. You were right to reproach me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你老说这样的话，存心要刺激我，”她说。“不过，话又说回来，我是自作自受。当初，家里要卖地供昆丁上哈佛，我跟你爸爸说过，一定也得给你作出同样的安排。后来赫伯特提出要让你进银行做事，我就说，杰生现在总算有依靠了。这以后开销越来越大，我只好变卖家具和剩下的那块牧场，我就立刻给她去信，我说她应当明白她和昆丁都得到了自己的一份，甚至还占去了该归杰生的一部分。现在得由她来补偿了。我说，看在父亲的份上地也应该这样做。我当时还满以为她会做到的。可是我不过是个没用的老婆子；我从小受到的教养都是认为人为了照顾骨肉兄弟是会自奉俭朴的。这都是我的错儿。你怪罪于我是完全有理的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When I finished my cigar and went up, the light was still on. I could see the empty keyhole, but I couldn't hear a sound. She studied quiet. Maybe she learned that in school. I told Mother goodnight and went on to my room and got the box out and counted it again. I could hear the Great American Gelding snoring away like a planing mill. I read somewhere they'd fix men that way to give them women's voices. But maybe he didn't know what they'd done to him. I don't reckon he even knew what he had been trying to do, or why Mr Burgess knocked him out with the fence picket. And if they'd just sent him on to Jackson while he was under the ether, he'd never have known the difference. But that would have been too simple for a Compson to think of. Not half complex enough. Having to wait to do it at all until he broke out and tried to run a little girl down on the street with her own father looking at him. Well, like I say they never started soon enough with their cutting, and they quit too quick. I know at least two more that needed something like that, and one of them not over a mile away, either. But then I don't reckon even that would do any good. Like I say once a bitch always a bitch. And just let me have twenty-four hours without any dam New York jew to advise me what it's going to do. I don't want to make a killing; save that to suck in the smart gamblers with. I just want an even chance to get my money back. And once I've done that they can bring all Beale street and all bedlam in here and two of them can sleep in my bed and another one can have my place at the table too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我抽完雪茄上楼的时候，昆丁房里的灯光还亮着。我看见那个抽去了钥匙的钥匙孔，可是我听不到一点儿声音。她用功的时候可真够安静的。也许她在学校里也是这样学习 的吧。我跟母亲说了声晚安就走进自己的房间，我把箱子取出来又把钱点了一遍。我听见那位“美国头号大太监”①鼾声如雷，就象一家锯木厂在通夜开工。我在某本书里读到过，有的男人，为了说话象女人那样尖声尖气，就让自己给动了手术。不过也许班根本不知道人家给他动过手术了。我看他当时想干什么连自己都不清楚呢，也不明白伯吉斯先生干吗要用栅栏桩子把他打晕。而且如果不等他麻药药劲过去就把他送到杰克逊去，我敢说他也根本察觉不出来自己换了地方。可是康普生家的人是不会考虑这样一个直截了当的办法的。比这复杂一倍的办法他们还看不上呢。总要等到他冲出了大门，在街上追赶一个小姑娘，而她的爸爸又恰好在近旁看到了这幅景象，他们才肯采取措施。哼，我早就说过了，他们迟迟不舍得用刀，用了又赶紧把刀子收起来，据我所知，至少还有两个傻子也应该动这样的手术，其中一个就近在一英里之内的地方。可是即使都这样做了，也不见得能解决问题。我早说过，天生是贱坯就永远是贱坯。给我二十四小时自由 行动的权力试试看，别让那些该死的纽约犹太佬来对我指手划脚。我倒不是想大捞一把，这种手段只可以用来对付那些鬼精灵的赌棍。我只求给我一个公平的机会，让我把自己的钱赚回来。等我赚回来了，那就让整条比尔街和整个疯人院都搬到我家里来好了，让其中的两位②到我的床 上去睡，再让另一位③坐到我餐桌的位于上去大吃大喝好了。（注：①指班吉。②指凯蒂与小昆丁。③指班吉。）">查看中文翻译</div>
