<div class="line_en">Calcifer was very interested. "I knew he came from foreign parts," he said. "But this sounds like another world. Clever of the Witch to send the curse in from there. Very clever all round. That's magic I admire, using something that exists anyway and turning it round into a curse. I did wonder about it when you and Michael were reading it the other day. That fool Howl told her too much about himself."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡西法深感兴趣。“我就知道他来自外国，”它说：“但这听起来好象是另一个世界似的。这女巫好厉害！居然把诅咒由那里送过来，真是有够厉害！我最钦佩这一类咒语了…利用本就存在的东西，将它变成咒语，你跟麦可那天在念的时候我就有点想到了，那个笨蛋哈尔跟她说了太多自己的事了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sophie did not see much point in blackening Howl's name to the King, now that the Witch had caught up with him. But Howl said it was more important than ever. "I shall need everything I've got just to escape the Witch," he said. "I can't have the King after me as well."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="既然荒地女巫已经追上来了，苏菲觉得现在应该没什么必要去国王那里破坏哈尔的名声了，但是哈尔说，现在更需要如此做。“我得用尽所有的方法来躲开女巫，”他说：“我不要国王这时来插一脚。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So the following afternoon Sophie put on her new clothes and sat feeling very fine, if rather stiff, waiting for Michael to get ready and for Howl to finish in the bathroom. While she waited, she told Calcifer about the strange country where Howl's family lived. It took her mind off the King.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所以，次日下午苏菲就穿上新衣，坐着等麦可穿好衣服和哈尔由浴室化妆出来。她觉得心情还好，就是整个人有点僵僵的。在等那两个男生的时候，她跟卡西法描述哈尔家人居住的那个奇异的国家，这样她就不会尽想着国王的事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sophie gazed at Calcifer's thin blue face. It did not surprise her to find Calcifer admired the curse, any more than it surprised her when he called Howl a fool. He was always insulting Howl. But she never could work out if Calcifer really hated Howl. Calcifer looked so evil anyway that it was hard to tell.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="苏菲凝视着卡西法瘦削的蓝脸。卡西法会钦佩这个咒语并不令她感到惊讶，它称哈尔为笨蛋也不令她惊奇。它长在言词上侮辱哈尔，但是她一直都不确定它是否真的憎恨哈尔，因为卡西法看起来很邪恶，所以很难看得出它真正的想法。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Kingsbury was a long way south and it was a bakingly hot day there. The pavements shimmered. Sophie discovered another disadvantage to being old: you felt queer in hot weather. The elaborate buildings wavered in front of her eyes. She was annoyed, because she wanted to look at the place, but all she had was a dim impression of golden domes and tall houses.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="金斯别利的位置很南方，那天又非常炎热，像火炉一般，街道都冒出热气。苏菲发现年老还有一个坏处，在热天里特别觉得不对劲。那些精巧的建筑在她眼前晃呀晃的，她很懊恼！以为她很想好好看看这个城市，但是她只模糊地记得有金色的圆顶和建筑高大的房子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I get by quite well with a plain name," Sophie said as they turned into a blessedly narrow, cool street.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mrs. Pentstemmon's house was gracious and tall, near the end of the narrow street. It had orange trees in tubs on either side of its handsome front door. This door was opened by an elderly footman in black velvet, who led them into a wonderfully cool black-and-white checkered marble hall, where Michael tried secretly to wipe sweat off his face. Howl, who always seemed to be cool, treated the footman as an old friend and made jokes to him.</div>

<div class="line_en">The footman passed them on to a page boy in red velvet. Sophie, as the boy led them ceremoniously up polished stairs, began to see why this made good practice for meeting the King. She felt as if she were in a palace already. When the boy ushered them into a shaded drawing room, she was sure even a palace could not be this elegant. Everything in the room was blue and gold and white, and small and fine. Mrs. Pentstemmon was finest of all. She was tall and thin, and she sat bolt upright in a blue-and-gold embroidered chair, supporting herself rigidly with one hand, in a gold-mesh mitten, on a gold-topped cane. She wore old-gold silk, in a very stiff and old-fashioned style, finished off with an old-gold headdress not unlike a crown, which tied in a large old-gold bow beneath her gaunt eagle face. She was the finest and most frightening lady Sophie had ever seen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这位仆人将他们转叫给一位穿红色丝绒制服的侍童。当这位侍童慎重其事地领着他们走上光可鉴人的楼梯时，苏菲开始了解为什么哈尔会说在觐见国王之前，这里会是一个很好的预习场所了。她觉得自己简直已经是在王宫里了。那男童领他们进入一间会客室，苏菲觉得就是王宫也不可能比这个房间还优雅。房里所有的东西都是蓝色、金色和白色，小巧而且精致，但这些都比不上潘思德曼太太本人。她高高瘦瘦，身体挺得比值地坐在一张有金色刺绣的椅子上，一手僵硬地执杖支撑自己。手上戴着金色网状手套，拐杖头则由黄金打造而成。她身穿一袭暗金黄色丝质衣裳，样式僵硬而古板。头上戴一顶类似王冠的暗金头饰，以暗金色的带子在下巴上绑了一个大结，她的脸瘦削如老鹰。她是苏菲所见过最华美、也最令人敬畏的人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Howl bent and kissed the mitten, as he was obviously supposed to. He did it very gracefully, but it was rather spoiled from the back view by Howl flapping his other hand furiously at Michael behind his back. Michael, a little too slowly, realized he was supposed to stand by the door beside the page boy. He backed there in a hurry, only too pleased to get as far away from Mrs. Pentstemmon as he could.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈尔弯腰亲吻手套，那显然是必须遵守的礼仪。他做得很优雅，但是若由背后看来，可就大穿帮了——他另一只手放在背后，拼命对麦可挥着。麦可终于明白他应该去门边和那个侍童站在一起才对。他迅速地倒退而行，心里很高兴能远离潘思德曼太太。">查看中文翻译</div>

Sophie was not sure if Mrs. Pentstemmon meant her to kiss the mitten as well, but she could not bring herself to try. She laid her own hand on the mitten instead. The hand under it felt like an old, cold claw. After feeling it, Sophie was quite surprised that Mrs. Pentstemmon was alive.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“太好了，很高兴。”潘思德曼太太说着，对苏菲伸出她戴有金网手套的手。苏菲不确定潘思德曼太太的意思是不是要她亲吻手套，但她提不起勇气尝试，只是把手放在手套上，手套下的手感觉像是只苍老、冰冷的爪子。在接触过她的手后，苏菲很惊讶潘思德曼太太居然还活着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mrs. Pentstemmon gave him a look which told Sophie she had been a teacher at least as fierce as Miss Angorian. "I am talking to your mother," she said.

<div class="line_cn" title="潘思德曼太太斜凝了他一眼，那眼光令苏菲知道，她当老师时严格的程度绝对不输给安歌丽雅小姐。“我现在是在跟你妈妈说话。我敢打赌她跟我一样以你为傲，我们两个老妇人可说是共同把你塑造成型的。就某种意义而言，你是我们的共同成品。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">If Sophie had not been so nervous herself, she might have laughed at the expression on Howl's face. She had obviously not expected this to happen at all. But he got up, with only a light shrug, made a slight warning face at Sophie, and shooed Michael out of the room ahead of him. Mrs. Pentstemmon turned her rigid body very slightly to watch them go. Then she nodded at the page boy, who scuttled out of the room too. After that, Mrs. Pentstemmon turned herself back toward Sophie, and Sophie felt more nervous than ever.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="假如苏菲不是那么紧张的话，哈尔脸上的表情一定会让她笑出来，他显然一点都没预期到事情会变成这样，不过，他略略耸了一下肩膀后，还是站起来，投给苏菲一个略带警告的脸色，挥手要麦可在他之前走出房间。潘思德曼太太僵硬的身体稍微转过去，目送他们离开房间，然后她对侍童点点头，于是他也匆忙离开。在那之后，潘思德曼太太转过来面对苏菲，这令苏菲更加紧张。">查看中文翻译</div>

It is a dazzling attraction charm, directed at ladies -- very well done, I admit, and barely detectable even to my trained eyes, since it appears to have been darned into the seams -- and one which will render him almost irresistible to ladies. This represents a downward trend into black arts which must surely cause you some motherly concern, Mrs. Pendragon."</div>

I was about to retire when he came to me out of a foreign land. I thought my work was done when I trained Benjamin Sullivan-whom you probably know better as Wizard Suliman, rest his soul! -- and procured him the post of Royal Magician. Oddly enough, he came from the same country as Howell. Then Howell came, and I saw at a glance that he had twice the imagination and twice the capabilities, and, though I admit he had some faults of character, I knew he was a force for good. Good, Mrs. Pendragon. But what is he now?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不会错的，围龙太太。”潘思德曼太太说：“这也是为什么我急着跟你见面的原因。你知道，哈尔是我的关门弟子，同时也是我教过最出色的学生。在我将退休时，他由国外跑来。我训练好班哲明。苏利曼后，本以为我的教书生涯已经告一段落。班哲明，你比较熟悉的名字大概是苏利曼巫师吧？我帮他找了宫廷魔法师的工作，巧的是，他跟哈尔都来自同一个国家。哈尔出现时，我一看就知道他的想象力和能力都在苏利曼的两倍之上。虽然个性上有些缺点，但是瑕不遮瑜，我知道他是良善的力量。良善！但是围龙太太，他现在成了什么样了？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Something has happened to him," Mrs. Pentstemmon said, still staring piercingly at Sophie. "And I am determined to put that right before I die."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他一定出过什么事。”潘思德曼太太仍然紧盯着苏菲，说：“我死前一定要把这个纠正过来。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What do you think has happened?" Sophie asked uncomfortably.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“依你猜测，是出了什么错？”苏菲不安地问道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I must rely on you to tell me that," said Mrs. Pentstemmon. "My feeling is that he has gone the same way as the Witch of the Waste. They tell me she was not wicked once -- though I have this only on hearsay, since she is older that either of us and keeps herself young by her arts. Howell has gifts in the same order as hers. It seems as if those of high ability cannot resist some extra, dangerous stroke of cleverness, which results in a fatal flaw and begins a slow decline to evil. Do you, by any chance, have a clue what it might be?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我必须仰仗你来告诉我。”潘思德曼太太说：“我的感觉是，他走上跟荒地女巫一样的路了。我听说她原本不是恶人，当然这只是道听途说而已，因为她比我们两人年纪都大，她是靠着魔法维持青春不坠的，哈尔的天赋和她不相轩轾，看来越是天赋高的人，越难避免在一些特别危险的事物上自作聪明，结果就造成致命伤，往邪恶一路堕落下去。哈尔为什么会这样，你有没有任何概念？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What indeed?" Sophie said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是啊，为什么？”苏菲问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Calcifer's voice came into Sophie's mind, saying, "The contract isn't doing either of us any good in the long run." She felt a little chilly, in spite of the heat of the day blowing through the open windows of the shaded, elegant room. "Yes," she said. "He's made some sort of contract with his fire demon."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡西法的声音突然在苏菲脑中出现：“这契约长此以往对我们两人都很不好。”尽管外头的热风透过敞开的窗口吹进这个优雅的房间，她仍然打了一个寒战。“是的。”她说：“他跟他的火魔签了某种契约。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mrs. Pentstemmon's hands shook a little on her stick. "That will be it. You must break that contract, Mrs. Pendragon."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="潘思德曼太太拄着拐杖的双手微颤了一下。“这就是了！围龙太太，你一定要把那个契约打破。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I would if I knew how," Sophie said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“但愿我知道该怎么做。”苏菲说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Surely your own maternal feelings and your own strong magic gift will tell you how," Mrs. Pentstemmon said. "I have been looking at you, Mrs. Pendragon, though you may not have noticed --"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我确信你的母性本能和你本身强大的魔法天赋，将会给你指出一个方法。”潘思德曼太太说：“围龙太太，或许你没注意到，但我一直在观察你…”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"-- and I like your gift," said Mrs. Pentstemmon. 'It brings life to things, such as that stick in your hand, which you have evidently talked to, to the extent that it has become what the layman would call a magic wand. I think you would not find it too hard to break that a contract."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“而我喜欢你的天赋。”潘思德曼太太说：“它能赋予你生命。比如你手中的拐杖吧，显然你跟它说过话，说多了它就变成一根外行人所说的魔杖。我想，要破除那个契约你应该不会太困难才是。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes, but I need to know what the terms of it are," Sophie said. "Did Howl tell you I was a witch, because if he did --"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“但是，我需要知道契约的内容。”苏菲说：“是哈尔跟你说我是女巫的吗？因为如果他…”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, I noticed, Mrs. Pentstemmon," Sophie said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“噢，我注意到了，潘思德曼太太。”苏菲说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He did not. There is no need to be coy. You can rely on my experience to know these things," said Mrs. Pentstemmon. Then, to Sophie's relief, she shut her eyes. It was like a strong light being turned off. "I do not now, nor do I wish to know about such contracts," she said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他没有。你无需觉得不好意思。我的经验足以察知像这样的事情。”说完，她闭上双眼，那感觉就像强光突然被关掉一样，苏菲暗暗松一口气。“关于那种契约，”她说：“我并不清楚，也不想知道。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Her cane wobbled again, as if she might be shuddering. Her mouth quirked into a line, suggesting she had unexpectedly bitten on a peppercorn. "But I now see," she said, "what has happened to the Witch. She made a contract with a fire demon and, over the years, that demon has taken control of her. Demons do not understand good and evil. But they can be bribed into a contract, provided the human offers them something valuable, something only humans have. This prolongs the life of both human and demon, and the human gets the demon's magic power to add to his or her own." Mrs. Pentstemmon opened her eyes again. "That is all I can bear to say on the subject," she said, "except to advise you to find out what that demon got. Now I must bid you farewell. I have to rest awhile."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她的拐杖又动了一下，好象她在颤抖似的，嘴巴则抿成一条直线，好象无意中咬到辣椒一样。“不过我终于明白，”她说：“女巫发生了什么事。她跟火魔签约。随着时间过去，火魔控制了她。邪魔是不了解善恶的分野的，但是如果人类能给它们贵重的东西——只有人类独有的东西的话，它们就会接受贿赂而签下契约。经由契约，两者的生命都得以获得延长，而人类也可以获得火魔的法力，增长自己原有的功力。”潘思德曼太太再度张开眼睛。“关于这个话题，我只能说这么多了。你必须找出火魔由哈尔那里拿了什么。我得跟你说再见了，我需要休息一会儿。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And like magic, which it probably was, the door opened and the page boy came in to usher Sophie out of the room. Sophie was extremely glad to go. She was all but squirming with embarrassment by then. She looked back at Mrs. Pentstemmon's rigid, upright form as the door closed and wondered if Mrs. Pentstemmon would have made her feel this bad if she had really and truly been Howl's old mother. Sophie rather thought she would. "I take my hat off to Howl for standing her as a teacher for more than a day!" she murmured to herself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后就像魔法一样，也有可能是出于魔法，门打开，侍童走了进来，领苏菲出去。苏菲很高兴终于可以离开，她已经快尴尬到无地自容了。她转过头看到门阂起来，将潘思德曼太太僵硬挺直的身影关在门后。她想着：若自己真是哈尔的母亲的话，是不是还会怕潘思德曼太太怕得这么厉害？答案是‘会’。她喃喃地跟自己说：“真是蛮佩服哈尔的！可以忍受这样可怕的老师一天以上。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Madam?" asked the page boy, thinking Sophie was talking to him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“什么事，夫人？”带路的侍童问她，以为她在跟他说话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I said go slowly down the stairs or I can't keep up," Sophie told him. Her knees were wobbling. "You young boys dash about so," she said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我说，下楼梯要走慢点，不然我跟不上。”苏菲说，她的膝盖发着抖。“你们年轻人就是横冲直撞的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The page boy took her slowly and considerately down the shiny stairs. Halfway down, Sophie recovered enough from Mrs. Pentstemmon's personality to think of some of the things Mrs. Pentstemmon had actually said. She had said Sophie was a witch. Oddly enough, Sophie accepted this without any trouble at all. That explained the popularity of certain hats, she thought. It explained Jane Farrier's Count Whatsit. It possibly explained the jealously of the Witch of the Waste. It was as if Sophie had always known this. But she had thought it was not proper to have a magic gift because she was the eldest of three. Lettie had been far more sensible about such things.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那侍童体贴地领着她慢慢走下光可鉴人的楼梯。走到一半时，苏菲逐渐由惊吓的情绪中恢复过来，开始思考潘思德曼太太方才说的话。她说苏菲是女巫，奇怪的事，苏菲很自然就接受了。因为这说明了为什么一些特定的帽子会热卖，珍法丽儿为何能嫁给某某男爵，也就说明了为什么荒地女巫会嫉妒她。苏菲似乎一直都知道这些事，但潜意识里她有可以逃避，觉得身为三个小孩中的老大，不应该有这样神奇的天赋礼物。乐蒂则较能理性地看待这些事情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then she thought of the gray-and-scarlet suit and nearly fell downstairs with dismay. She was the one who had put the charm on that. She could hear herself now, murmuring to it. "Built to pull in the girls!" she had told it. And of course it did. It had charmed Lettie that day in the orchard. Yesterday, somewhat disguised, it must have had its effect on Miss Angorian too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着她想到那件灰色与大红色的外套，一失神，差点跌下楼梯。是她把迷咒放上去的！她还记得自己是怎么跟那件衣服说的——缝了好迷死女孩子们！那衣服当然照做了。那天在果园里它吸引了乐蒂。昨天表面上装得若无其事，安歌丽雅小姐暗地里一定也手到它的影响。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Oh, dear! Sophie thought. I've gone and doubled the number of hearts he'll have broken! I must get that suit off him somehow!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="天哪！苏菲心中暗暗叫苦，我是帮凶！帮他伤了两倍的女孩子的心！明天一定得想办法把那件衣服由他身上剥下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She shook her head. "After Mrs. Pentstemmon," she said, "the King of Ingary will seem just like an ordinary person."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因此她摇摇头，说：“见过潘思德曼太太后，印格利国国王看起来大概会跟普通人差不多了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sophie certainly did not wish to see the King. But she thought of what Calcifer had said. If the King commanded Howl to go into the Waste and the Witch caught him, Sophie's own chance of being young again would have gone too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="苏菲当然不想见国王，但是她想到卡西法说的话。如果国王命令哈尔到荒地去，而哈尔不幸地被女巫抓住，苏菲自己也会失去回复年轻的机会。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Howl, in that same suit, was waiting in the cool black-and-white hall with Michael. Michael nudged Howl in a worried way as Sophie came slowly down the stairs behind the page boy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈尔就穿着那套衣服跟麦可在凉爽的黑白相间客厅里等她。麦可看到苏菲缓慢地跟在侍童身后走下楼梯，担忧地以手肘轻推了哈尔一下。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Howl looked saddened. "You seem a bit ragged," he said. "I think we'd better skip seeing the King. I'll go blacken my own name when I make your excuses. I can say my wicked ways have made you ill. That could be true, from the look of you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈尔露出难过的表情。“你看起来糟透了！我看我们不要去见国王好了。我去跟国王解释你不能去的理由时，会顺便自我抹黑，我可以说是我邪恶的行为把你气病什么的。那也是实话，瞧你这个样子。”">查看中文翻译</div>
