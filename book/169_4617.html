<div class="line_en">The Cinnamon Wind was a swan ship out of Tall Trees Town on the Summer Isles, where men were black, women were wanton, and even the gods were strange. She had no septon aboard her to lead them in the prayers of passing, so the task fell to Samwell Tarly, somewhere off the sun-scorched southern coast of Dorne.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sam donned his blacks to say the words, though the afternoon was warm and muggy, with nary a breath of wind. "He was a good man," he began… but as soon as he had said the words he knew that they were wrong. "No. He was a great man. A maester of the Citadel, chained and sworn, and Sworn Brother of the Night's Watch, ever faithful. When he was born they named him for a hero who had died too young, but though he lived a long long time, his own life was no less heroic. No man was wiser, or gentler, or kinder. At the Wall, a dozen lords commander came and went during his years of service, but he was always there to counsel them. He counseled kings as well. He could have been a king himself, but when they offered him the crown he told them they should give it to his younger brother. How many men would do that?" Sam felt the tears welling in his eyes, and knew he could not go on much longer. "He was the blood of the dragon, but now his fire has gone out. He was Aemon Targaryen. And now his watch is ended."</div>

<div class="line_en">"And now his watch is ended," Gilly murmured after him, rocking the babe in her arms. Kojja Mo echoed her in the Common Tongue of Westeros, then repeated the words in the Summer Tongue for Xhondo and her father and the rest of the assembled crew. Sam hung his head and began to weep, his sobs so loud and wrenching that they made his whole body shake. Gilly came and stood beside him and let him cry upon her shoulder. There were tears in her eyes as well.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他的守望至死方休，于斯结束。”吉莉一边跟着他轻声念，一边摇晃怀抱中的婴儿。蔻佳·莫先用维斯特洛通用语，然后又用盛夏群岛语为她父亲、崇及其余聚集的船员们说了一遍。山姆垂下脑袋放声哭泣，悲哀得整个身子都在颤抖。吉莉站到他身旁，让他靠在她肩上。她眼中也有泪花。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The air was moist and warm and dead calm, and the Cinnamon Wind was adrift upon a deep blue sea far beyond the sight of land. "Black Sam said good words," Xhondo said. "Now we drink his life." He shouted something in the Summer Tongue, and a cask of spiced rum was rolled up onto the afterdeck and breached, so those on watch might down a cup in the memory of the old blind dragon. The crew had known him only a short while, but Summer Islanders revered the elderly and celebrated their dead.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="空气潮湿温暖，出奇的平静，月桂风号漂浮在远离陆地的深蓝色海洋上。“黑衣山姆说得好，”崇说，“现在，让我们为他的生命干杯。”他用盛夏群岛语说了句什么，一桶兑有香料的朗姆酒便被推到后甲板上打开，当班的船员个个喝下一杯，以兹纪念盲眼老龙。船员们识得他的时间虽短，但盛夏群岛人敬重长者，并有为亡人举行盛典的习俗。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sam had never drunk rum before. The liquor was strange and heady; sweet at first, but with a fiery aftertaste that burned his tongue. He was tired, so tired. Every muscle he had was aching, and there were other aches in places where Sam hadn't known he had muscles. His knees were stiff, his hands covered with fresh new blisters and raw, sticky patches of skin where the old blisters had burst. Yet between them, rum and sadness seemed to wash his hurts away. "If only we could have gotten him to Oldtown, the archmaesters might have saved him," he told Gilly, as they sipped their rum on the Cinnamon Wind's high forecastle. "The healers of the Citadel are the best in the Seven Kingdoms. For a while I thought… I hoped…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山姆没喝过朗姆酒。这种酒味道奇特，容易上头；入口虽甜，但有股强烈的余味烧灼舌头。他累，累极了，每块肌肉都在疼，甚至有些自以为没长肉的地方也疼。他膝盖僵硬，双手覆满新磨的水泡，旧水泡破裂之处则沾着黏黏的皮。然而朗姆酒和悲哀似乎占据了他的整个心灵。“把师傅带到旧镇，博士们也许能救他。”他告诉吉莉，他们在月桂风号高高的前楼上呷朗姆酒。“学城的医师是七大王国最好的。我一度以为…我希望…”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">On Braavos, it had seemed possible that Aemon might recover. Xhondo's talk of dragons had almost seemed to restore the old man to himself. That night he ate every bite Sam put before him. "No one ever looked for a girl," he said. "It was a prince that was promised, not a princess. Rhaegar, I thought… the smoke was from the fire that devoured Summerhall on the day of his birth, the salt from the tears shed for those who died. He shared my belief when he was young, but later he became persuaded that it was his own son who fulfilled the prophecy, for a comet had been seen above King's Landing on the night Aegon was conceived, and Rhaegar was certain the bleeding star had to be a comet. What fools we were, who thought ourselves so wise! The error crept in from the translation. Dragons are neither male nor female, Barth saw the truth of that, but now one and now the other, as changeable as flame. The language misled us all for a thousand years. Daenerys is the one, born amidst salt and smoke. The dragons prove it." Just talking of her seemed to make him stronger. "I must go to her. I must. Would that I was even ten years younger."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在布拉佛斯，伊蒙似乎有望复原。崇关于龙的谈话几乎让老人恢复常态。那晚，他吃光了山姆置办的食物。“没人想到是女孩，”他说，“预言说的是王子，不是公主。我以为是雷加…他出生那天，烟雾从烈火熊熊的盛夏厅中升起，而盐来自为死者流下的眼泪。他小时候也跟我一样如此相信，后来却认为自己的儿子才应和了预言，因为他确信在他种下伊耿的当晚，一颗彗星出现在君临上空，那便是所谓的‘星辰泣血’。我们全是傻瓜，自以为是的傻瓜！错误恰恰出在对预言的解释上。我们忘了巴斯的提醒，龙没有性别，非雄非雌，不断变幻，像火焰一样摇摆不定。语言的局限误导了我们一千年。丹妮莉丝才是真正诞生于烟与盐之地，而她的龙证明了她的身份。”单单谈到她，他便精神抖擞。“我必须去她那儿。必须。啊，我要是再年轻十岁就好了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The captain wanted Aemon's chain as well, but there Sam had refused. It was a great shame for any maester to surrender his chain, he had explained. Xhondo had to go over that part three times before Quhuru Mo accepted it. By the time the dealing was done, Sam was down to his boots and blacks and smallclothes, and the broken horn Jon Snow had found on the Fist of First Men. I had no choice, he told himself. We could not stay on Braavos, and short of theft or beggary, there was no other way to pay for passage. He would have counted it cheap at thrice the price if only they had gotten Maester Aemon safe to Oldtown.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="船长还想要伊蒙的颈链，但山姆拒绝了。他解释道，交出颈链是学士最大的耻辱，崇重复了三遍，库忽鲁·莫才接受。等交易完成，山姆只剩鞋子、黑袍和内衣，外加琼恩·雪诺在先民拳峰找到的破号角。我别无选择，他告诉自己，我们不能留在布拉佛斯，而除了偷窃与乞讨之外，也没有其他方法支付旅资。再说，即使再花三倍价钱，只要能让伊蒙学士安全抵达旧镇，他也心甘情愿。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The old man had been so determined that he had even walked up the plank onto the Cinnamon Wind on his own two legs, after Sam made arrangements for their passage. He had already given his sword and scabbard to Xhondo, to repay the big mate for the feathered cloak he'd ruined saving Sam from drowning. The only things of value that still remained to them were the books they had brought from the vaults of Castle Black. Sam parted with them glumly. "They were meant for the Citadel," he said, when Xhondo asked him what was wrong. When the mate translated those words, the captain laughed. "Quhuru Mo says the grey men will be having these books still," Xhondo told him, "only they will be buying them from Quhuru Mo. The maesters give good silver for books they are not having, and sometimes red and yellow gold."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="老人如此坚决，甚至靠自己的双腿走上月桂风号的踏板。行程由山姆安排，崇从水中救了他一命，但羽毛披风也因此而毁了，山姆便将自己的剑连同剑鞘一起赔给这位身材魁梧的大副。他们只剩下从黑城堡地窖里带出来的书。山姆闷闷不乐地将它们交出去，崇问有什么问题，他说，“这些本来是要给学城的。”大副将这番话翻译过去之后，船长大笑。“库忽鲁·莫说灰衣人最终仍会得到这些书，”崇告诉他，“只不过得从库忽鲁·莫那儿买。对于没有的书籍，学士们愿意付银币，甚至是红红黄黄的金子。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You must tell them, Sam," he said. "The archmaesters. You must make them understand. The men who were at the Citadel when I was have been dead for fifty years. These others never knew me. My letters… in Oldtown, they must have read like the ravings of an old man whose wits had fled. You must convince them, where I could not.

<div class="line_en">Their passage south had been a stormy one, however, and every gale took its toll on the old man's strength and spirits. At Pentos he asked to be brought up onto deck so Sam might paint a picture of the city for him with words, but that was the last time he left the captain's bed. Soon after that, his wits began to wander once again. By the time the Cinnamon Wind swept past the Bleeding Tower into Tyrosh harbor, Aemon no longer spoke of trying to find a ship to take him east. Instead his talk turned back to Oldtown, and the archmaesters of the Citadel.</div>

<div class="line_en">"No," the old man said. "It must be you. Tell them. The prophecy… my brother's dream… Lady Melisandre has misread the signs. Stannis… Stannis has some of the dragon blood in him, yes. His brothers did as well. Rhaelle, Egg's little girl, she was how they came by it… their father's mother… she used to call me Uncle Maester when she was a little girl. I remembered that, so I allowed myself to hope… perhaps I wanted to… we all deceive ourselves, when we want to believe. Melisandre most of all, I think. The sword is wrong, she has to know that… light without heat… an empty glamor… the sword is wrong, and the false light can only lead us deeper into darkness, Sam. Daenerys is our hope. Tell them that, at the Citadel. Make them listen. They must send her a maester. Daenerys must be counseled, taught, protected. For all these years I've lingered, waiting, watching, and now that the day has dawned I am too old. I am dying, Sam." Tears ran from his blind white eyes at that admission. "Death should hold no fear for a man as old as me, but it does. Isn't that silly? It is always dark where I am, so why should I fear the darkness? Yet I cannot help but wonder what will follow, when the last warmth leaves my body. Will I feast forever in the Father's golden hall as the septons say? Will I talk with Egg again, find Dareon whole and happy, hear my sisters singing to their children? What if the horselords have the truth of it? Will I ride through the night sky forever on a stallion made of flame? Or must I return again to this vale of sorrow? Who can say, truly? Who has been beyond the wall of death to see? Only the wights, and we know what they are like. We know."</div>

<div class="line_en">That had been one of his last good days. After that the old man spent more time sleeping than awake, curled up beneath a pile of furs in the captain's cabin. Sometimes he would mutter in his sleep. When he woke he'd call for Sam, insisting that he had to tell him something, but oft as not he would have forgotten what he meant to say by the time that Sam arrived. Even when he did recall, his talk was all a jumble. He spoke of dreams and never named the dreamer, of a glass candle that could not be lit and eggs that would not hatch. He said the sphinx was the riddle, not the riddler, whatever that meant. He asked Sam to read for him from a book by Septon Barth, whose writings had been burned during the reign of Baelor the Blessed. Once he woke up weeping. "The dragon must have three heads," he wailed, "but I am too old and frail to be one of them. I should be with her, showing her the way, but my body has betrayed me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那是他最后的清醒时日。再往后，老人蜷缩在船长舱室中一堆毛皮底下，昏睡时远远多过醒着的时候。他会在睡梦中喃喃自语，醒来后呼唤山姆，坚持要托付他一些事，但等山姆赶到，他已忘了要说什么。即使记得，也都语无伦次。他提到梦境，却没说是谁的梦，还提到点不燃的玻璃蜡烛和无法孵化的蛋。他说斯芬克斯即是谜题，并非出谜题者，天知道那是什么意思。他要山姆念巴斯修士写的一本书，此人的著作在受神祝福的贝勒王统治期间惨遭焚毁。有一回他哭着醒来。“龙有三个头，”他哀叹，“但我年迈体弱，无法成为其中之一。我应该跟她在一起，为她指引方向，可我的身体啊，实在难以胜任。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was little and less that Sam could say to that, but he had given the old man what little comfort he could.

<div class="line_en">"Or else she might have burned him. The red woman." Even here, a thousand leagues from the Wall, Gilly was reluctant to say Lady Melisandre's name aloud. "She wanted king's blood for her fires. Val knew she did. Lord Snow too. That was why they made me take Dalla's babe away and leave my own behind in his place.

When the pirates had attacked them in the Stepstones, Kojja's arrows had slain a dozen of them whilst Sam's own shafts were falling in the water. The only thing Kojja Mo loved better than her bow was bouncing Dalla's boy upon her knee and singing to him in the Summer Tongue. The wildling prince had become the darling of all the women in the crew, and Gilly seemed to trust them with him as she had never trusted any man.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I know you do." For most of her life the only man Gilly had known had been the terrifying Craster. The rest of her world had been female. Men frighten her, but women don't, Sam realized. He could understand that. Back at Horn Hill he had preferred the company of girls as well. His sisters had been kind to him, and though the other girls would sometimes taunt him, cruel words were easier to shrug off than the blows and buffets he got from the other castle boys. Even now, on the Cinnamon Wind, Sam felt more comfortable with Kojja Mo than with her father, though that might be because she spoke the Common Tongue and he did not.</div>

<div class="line_en">Yes, Sam thought, a drink for dragons. Their cups were empty, so he went over to the cask and filled them once again. The sun was low in the west, he saw, swollen to thrice its proper size. Its ruddy light made Gilly's face seem flushed and red. They drank a cup to Kojja Mo, and one to Dalla's boy, and one to Gilly's babe back on the Wall. And after that nothing would do but to drink two cups for Aemon of House Targaryen. "May the Father judge him justly," Sam said, sniffing. The sun was almost gone by the time they were done with Maester Aemon. Only a long thin line of red still glowed upon the western horizon, like a slash across the sky. Gilly said that the drink was making the ship spin round, so Sam helped her down the ladder to the women's quarters in the bow of the ship.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sam found himself kissing her back. I said the words, he thought, but her hands were tugging at his blacks, pulling at the laces of his breeches. He broke off the kiss long enough to say, "We can't," but Gilly said, "We can," and covered his mouth with her own again. The Cinnamon Wind was spinning all around them and he could taste the rum on Gilly's tongue and the next thing her breasts were bare and he was touching them. I said the words, Sam thought again, but one of her nipples found its way between his lips. It was pink and hard and when he sucked on it her milk filled his mouth, mingling with the taste of rum, and he had never tasted anything so fine and sweet and good. If I do this I am no better than Dareon, Sam thought, but it felt too good to stop. And suddenly his cock was out, jutting upward from his breeches like a fat pink mast. It looked so silly standing there that he might have laughed, but Gilly pushed him back onto her pallet, hiked her skirts up around her thighs, and lowered herself onto him with a little whimpery sound. That was even better than her nipples. She's so wet, he thought, gasping. I never knew a woman could get so wet down there. "I am your wife now," she whispered, sliding up and down on him. And Sam groaned and thought, No, no, you can't be, I said the words, I said the words, but the only word he said was, "Yes."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山姆发现自己在回应她的亲吻。我立过誓，他心想，但她的手在拽他的黑衣，解开裤带。他勉强将嘴撤开，趁片刻的空隙说，“不。”但吉莉说，“要。”然后又用自己的嘴堵住了山姆的嘴。月桂风号在周围旋转，他尝到吉莉舌尖朗姆酒的滋味，接下来，他已在抚摸吉莉赤裸的乳房。我立过誓，山姆再次想到，但一只乳头已伸进了唇间。他吮吸粉红坚挺的乳头，奶水溢满嘴巴，混杂着朗姆酒，如此香甜美妙。我跟戴利恩有什么区别？山姆心想，但那感觉实在太好，他无法停止。突然间，他的阳具伸了出来，从裤子里向上挺起，仿佛一根肥肥的粉红桅杆。它挺立在那儿，看上去傻乎乎的，他差点笑出来，但吉莉将他推到自己的铺位上，裙子撩至大腿，轻声呜咽着趴到他身上。这比她的乳头更美妙。她这么湿，他边想边喘气。我不晓得女人下面会这么湿。“我是你妻子了。”她一边低语，一边在他身上起起落落。山姆呻吟着，他心想，不，不，你不可以做我妻子，我立过誓，我立过誓，但说出口的只有一个字，“要。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Xhondo had no mercy, though, so all that Sam could do was struggle back into his blacks. He found them on the deck beneath his hammock, all bundled up in one damp heap. He sniffed at them to see how foul they were, and inhaled the smell of salt and sea and tar, wet canvas and mildew, fruit and fish and blackbelly rum, strange spices and exotic woods, and a heady bouquet of his own dried sweat. But Gilly's smell was on them too, the clean smell of her hair and the sweet smell of her milk, and that made him glad to wear them. He would have given much and more for warm dry socks, though. Some sort of fungus had begun to grow between his toes.</div>

<div class="line_en">If truth be told, Sam was so fumble-fingered that he doubted he was even doing the work of one good man, but he did try. He scrubbed decks and rubbed them smooth with stones, he hauled on anchor chains, he coiled rope and hunted rats, he sewed up torn sails, patched leaks with bubbling hot tar, boned fish and chopped fruit for the cook. Gilly tried as well. She was better in the rigging than Sam was, though from time to time the sight of so much empty water still made her close her eyes.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a long hot sticky day, made longer by his pounding head. Sam busied himself with ropes and sails and the other tasks that Xhondo set him, and tried not to let his eyes wander to the cask of rum that held old Maester Aemon's body… or to Gilly. He could not face the wildling girl right now, not after what they'd done last night. When she came up on deck he went below. When she went forward he went aft.
