<div class="line_en">If the poor Marionette had dangled there much longer, all hope would have been lost. Luckily for him, the Lovely Maiden with Azure Hair once again looked out of her window. Filled with pity at the sight of the poor little fellow being knocked helplessly about by the wind, she clapped her hands sharply together three times.</div>

<div class="line_en">At the signal, a loud whirr of wings in quick flight was heard and a large Falcon came and settled itself on the window ledge.</div>

<div class="line_en">"What do you command, my charming Fairy?" asked the Falcon, bending his beak in deep reverence (for it must be known that, after all, the Lovely Maiden with Azure Hair was none other than a very kind Fairy who had lived, for more than a thousand years, in the vicinity of the forest).</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“有什么吩咐啊，我仁慈的仙女？”老鹰说着，垂下鸟嘴致敬（因为要知道，这天蓝色头发的小女孩不是别人，正是最善良的仙女，她在这树林附近已住了一千多年了）。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Fairy clapped her hands twice. A magnificent Poodle appeared, walking on his hind legs just like a man.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="仙女于是又轻轻拍了两下手掌，来了一只很漂亮的卷毛狗。它像人那样用后腿直立走道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"At first glance, I thought he was dead. But I found I was wrong, for as soon as I loosened the knot around his neck, he gave a long sigh and mumbled with a faint voice, 'Now I feel better!'"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我看他好像死了，可还没全死，因为我一松开套在他喉咙的绳套，他叹了一口气，嘟囔了一声：‘这会儿我觉得好多了！’”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was dressed in court livery. A tricorn trimmed with gold lace was set at a rakish angle over a wig of white curls that dropped down to his waist. He wore a jaunty coat of chocolate-colored velvet, with diamond buttons, and with two huge pockets which were always filled with bones, dropped there at dinner by his loving mistress. Breeches of crimson velvet, silk stockings, and low, silver-buckled slippers completed his costume. His tail was encased in a blue silk covering, which was to protect it from the rain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这只卷毛狗身穿车夫的礼服，头戴金边小三角帽，白色假卷发垂到脖子上。巧克力色的上衣上钉着宝石钮扣，两边有两个大口袋，放主人吃饭时赏它的肉骨头。下身穿一条大红天鹅绒裤子、一双丝袜、一双开口软鞋。后面还有一样东西，很像雨伞稍，蓝绸子做的。下雨的时候用来藏它的尾巴。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Come, Medoro," said the Fairy to him. "Get my best coach ready and set out toward the forest. On reaching the oak tree, you will find a poor, half-dead Marionette stretched out on the grass. Lift him up tenderly, place him on the silken cushions of the coach, and bring him here to me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“做件好事，梅多罗！”仙女对卷毛狗说，“马上到我的厩房里，赶一辆最好的车子上树林子去。你到了大橡树底下，就会找到已经半死的可怜木偶直挺挺地躺在草地上。你把他抱起来，很小心很小心地放在车子坐垫上，把他送到这儿来。明白了吗，”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In a few minutes, a lovely little coach, made of glass, with lining as soft as whipped cream and chocolate pudding, and stuffed with canary feathers, pulled out of the stable. It was drawn by one hundred pairs of white mice, and the Poodle sat on the coachman's seat and snapped his whip gayly in the air, as if he were a real coachman in a hurry to get to his destination.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一转眼工夫，只见厩房里出来了一辆天蓝色的票亮小轿车，外面装饰着金丝雀羽毛，里面裱糊得象掼奶油和奶油蛋糕那样。车子用一百对白老鼠来拉，卷毛狗坐在驾车台上，左右地抽着鞭子，车夫赶路的时候都是这样的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In a quarter of an hour the coach was back. The Fairy, who was waiting at the door of the house, lifted the poor little Marionette in her arms, took him to a dainty room with mother-of-pearl walls, put him to bed, and sent immediately for the most famous doctors of the neighborhood to come to her.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I am sorry," said the Owl, "to have to contradict the Crow, my famous friend and colleague. To my mind this Marionette is alive; but if, by any evil chance, he were not, then that would be a sure sign that he is wholly dead!"</div>
