<div class="line_en">The truth was that her gorgeous, pale-skinned, dark-haired, brown-eyed daughter was more than a handful. From the moment she came home Marah was sick. Ear infections followed each other like cars on a train; just when one ended, another began. Colic caused her to cry in-consolably for hours at a time. Kate had lost count of the times she'd found herself in the living room in the middle of the night, holding her red-faced, shrieking daughter and quietly crying herself.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was embarrassing how ill-equipped she turned out to be for this blessed event that had been her secret girlhood dream. So embarrassing, in fact, that she told no one how overwhelmed she sometimes felt. When asked, she smiled brightly and said motherhood was the best thing that had ever happened to her. It was even true.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她从小就偷偷憧憬为人母，当这神奇的时刻终于来到，她却发现自己力有未逮，这实在很丢人，因为觉得太没面子，所以即使应付不来她也没有对任何人说。有人表示关心时，她总是露出灿烂的笑容，回答说当妈妈是她人生中最棒的一件事，绝对没说谎。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Marah would be a year old in three days and she had yet to sleep through the night. Four hours was her record so far. Thus, in the past twelve months, Kate hadn't slept through the night. Johnny always offered to get up. In the beginning he'd even gone so far as to throw back the covers, but Kate had always stopped him. It wasn't that she wanted to play the martyr, although she often felt like one.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="再过三天玛拉便满一岁了，但到现在她还没安稳睡过一整夜，最高纪录顶多四个小时。因此过去一年中，凯蒂不曾有过一夜好眠，强尼每次都会主动说要起床去哄女儿，一开始甚至真的掀开被子，但凯蒂每次都说不用了。她不是想扮演烈士，虽然她经常有这种感觉。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There were other problems, too. First off, her looks had gone to hell. She was pretty sure this was yet another ripple in the no-sleep pool. No amount of makeup or moisturizer helped. Her skin, always pale, was J. P. Patches white lately, except for the shadows under her eyes, which were a lovely shade of brown. She'd lost all of her baby weight except for ten pounds, but when you were five-foot-three, ten pounds was two sizes. She hadn't worn anything but sweats in almost a year.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她的烦恼不止这个。首先，她的模样糟透了，她猜想是长期无法安睡的结果，再多化妆品、保养品都无法改善，她的肤色原本就白，最近更是像小丑的白粉脸，只剩下两个黑眼圈。她的体重大致恢复了，只剩最后十磅，但她的身高才五英尺三寸，十磅等于衣服大两号，所以这一年来她每天都穿运动服。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Johnny had a job; it was that simple. Kate had given up her career to be a mom. Thus, getting up in the night was her job. At first she'd done it willingly, then at least with a smile. Lately, though, when Marah let out her first wail at eleven o'clock, Kate found herself praying for strength.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="强尼要上班，事情就这么简单。凯蒂放弃事业全心当妈妈，因此夜里起床是她的工作，一开始她心甘情愿，后来至少会挤出笑容，然而最近当玛拉在十一点哭起来，她发现自己祈求上帝赐予勇气。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She needed to start on an exercise program. Last week she'd found her old Jane Fonda workout tapes, a leotard, and leg warmers. Now all she had to do was hit play and get going.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Today's the day," she said aloud as she carried her daughter back to bed and gently tucked her in beneath the expensive pink and white cashmere blanket that had been a gift from Tully. Luxuriously soft, it had become the thing Marah chose to sleep with. No matter what toys or blankets Kate offered, Tully's was the one. "Try to sleep till seven o'clock. Mommy could use it."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Really?" Edna looked at her, then said into the phone, "Maury, put Tully on the story. She has an in. I'll call you back," and hung up. "Sit down, Tully."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“真的？”爱德娜看看她，然后对着电话说，“摩利，让塔莉负责这条新闻，她有门路。我再打给你。”说完，她挂断电话，“塔莉，坐下。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Numbly, she complied. Her legs had practically given out anyway. Those memories kept hammering her. "I need to help Katie," she muttered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她呆滞地听令，反正她的腿也撑不住了。回忆不断来袭。“我要去帮凯蒂。”她低声喃语。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Edna looked up at her, mouthed, "What is it?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱德娜看着她，用嘴型问：怎么了？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's a big story, Tully," Edna said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“塔莉，这是大新闻。”爱德娜说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Don't care?" Edna said sharply. "Oh, you care. Everyone wants this assignment, but you have an in. Do you know what that means?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不在乎？”爱德娜愤慨地说，“噢，你当然在乎，所有人都想抢这条大新闻，但你有门路，你知道那是什么意思吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tully frowned, trying to switch gears from her worry. It seemed vaguely wrong, to make this about her career. "I don't know."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="塔莉皱着眉头，尽可能暂时放下烦恼，利用这次事件拼事业似乎不太对，“我不知道。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She could barely form the words; they burned her mouth. "Johnny Ryan is my best friend's husband."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“强尼·雷恩是我好朋友的先生。”她好不容易才说出这句话，感觉像烧灼着她的嘴。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tully waved that off impatiently. "I don't care about that. She's my best friend."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="塔莉不耐烦地挥挥手，“我不在乎。她是我的好朋友。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Then you're not the woman I thought you were. Why can't you get an exclusive and comfort your friend?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“看来是我看走眼了，你不是我以为的那种人。难道你不能在安慰朋友的同时抢到独家？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What other way is there? You can get an interview that no one else will have. A thing like this will put you on the map. Could get you the news nook."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“还有别的方式吗？别人挤破头也抢不到的专访，你轻轻松松就能得到。把握这次机会，你很快就能打响名号，说不定还能将你推上头条播报台。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tully thought about that. "When you put it that way…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="塔莉考虑了一下，“如果用这种方式说…”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Exactly." Edna picked up the phone and dialed the number. "Hart can get us an exclusive, Maury. It's as good as done. I'll vouch for her." When she hung up, Edna's look was steely. "Don't let me down."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“对极了。”爱德娜拿起电话拨号，“摩利，哈特能拿到独家。绝对没问题，我替她担保。”挂断电话后，爱德娜的表情看起来很严厉，“不要让我失望。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">All the way from the restaurant and back to the office, Tully convinced herself that she'd done the right thing. At her desk, she threw her coat onto the back of her chair and called Kate. The phone rang and rang. Finally the answering machine picked up: You've reached the Ryan household. Neither Johnny nor Kate can come to the phone right now, but if you'll leave a message we'll get back to you as soon as we can.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="离开餐厅回办公室的路上，塔莉说服自己这样做没错。她回到座位，将大衣披在椅背上，拿起电话打给凯蒂。电话响了又响，最后被转到录音机：这里是雷恩家，强尼和凯蒂都暂时无法前来接听，若您不介意请留言，我们会尽快回电。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tully couldn't help but be seduced by that. The news nook was a desk on the morning show's set from which the day's biggest news stories were covered. The recognition factor for anyone assigned there was high. Daily national exposure. Several people had made the jump from news nook to host. "And I can protect Kate from everything while I'm there."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="塔莉禁不起诱惑。头条播报台是晨间新闻特别设的专区，报道一天的头条大新闻，只要能坐上那个位子，保证可以打开知名度，很多人以此作为跳板跃上主播大位，“而且我可以保护凯蒂不受骚扰。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At the beep, Tully said, "Hey, Katie, it's me. I just heard --"</div>

<div class="line_en">Kate picked up the phone and disabled the answering machine. "Hey," she said, sounding completely lost. "You got my message. Sorry about the machine. Those bloodsucking reporters won't leave me alone."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凯蒂接起电话，切断录音机。“嗨，”她的语气听起来非常茫然，“你收到我的留言了。对不起把你转到录音机，那些吸血鬼记者一直来烦我。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我们是永远的好朋友，对吧？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Right. You mean it, Tully?" Kate's voice lifted on the last question, took on an edge of hope.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嗯。你真的会去吗，塔莉？”凯蒂的音调略微上扬，带着一丝希望。">查看中文翻译</div>
