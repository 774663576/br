<div class="line_en">At that hour the streets of the city were very empty so that more than ever it seemed a city of the dead. The passers-by had an abstracted air so that you might almost have thought them ghosts. The sky was unclouded and the early sun shed a heavenly mildness on the scene; it was difficult to imagine, on that blithe, fresh, and smiling morn, that the city lay gasping, like a man whose life is being throttled out of him by a maniac's hands, in the dark clutch of the pestilence. It was incredible that nature (the blue of the sky was clear like a child's heart) should be so indifferent when men were writhing in agony and going to their death in fear. When the chairs were set down at the convent door a beggar arose from the ground and asked Kitty for alms. He was clad in faded and shapeless rags that looked as though he had raked them out of a muck-heap, and through their rents you saw his skin hard and rough and tanned like the hide of a goat; his bare legs were emaciated, and his head, with its shock of coarse grey hair (the cheeks hollow, the eyes wild) was the head of a madman. Kitty turned from him in frightened horror, and the chair-bearers in gruff tones bade him begone, but he was importunate, and to be rid of him, shuddering, Kitty gave him a few cash.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个时候大街上冷冷清清的，俨然是一座死城。路上的行人多是一副心不在焉的神态，让人以为是撞见四处游荡的幽灵了。天上一朵云彩也不见，和煦的晨光照在地上，叫人心里暖洋洋的。很难想象在这样一个清新愉悦的早晨，这座城市已经如同一个被疯子掐住脖子昏死过去的人，在瘟疫的魔爪下奄奄一息了。人们正在痛苦中挣扎，在恐惧中死去，而这美丽的自然（蓝蓝的天空清澈透明，宛如孩童净洁的心）竟然无动于衷。轿子停在修道院门口的时候，一个乞丐从地上站起来，朝凯蒂讨要东西。他衣衫褴褛，好像在粪堆里爬过似的。透过衣服的破口子，她看到他的皮肤粗糙难看，黑得像山羊皮，双腿赤裸着，骨瘦如柴。他蓬头垢面，脸颊陷进去了一个窝儿，眼神狂乱野蛮，简直就像一张疯子的脸。凯蒂惊恐不已地把目光收回来，轿夫大喊一声叫他滚开，但是他缠扰不休，就是不肯走。为了赶紧打发了他，凯蒂颤抖着给了他一些小钱。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">All the next day Kitty thought of the convent; and the morning after, early, soon after Walter had gone, taking the amah with her to get chairs, she crossed the river. It was barely day and the Chinese crowding the ferry boat, some in the blue cotton of the peasant, others in the black robes of respectability, had a strange look of the dead being borne over the water to the land of shadow. And when they stepped ashore they stood for a little at the landing-place uncertainly as though they did not quite know where to go, before desultorily, in twos and threes, they wandered up the hill.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天凯蒂的脑子里一天到晚都是那所修道院，过完一夜，瓦尔特刚走，天还很早，她就吩咐佣人去给她准备轿子，然后叫佣人陪着过了河。天刚蒙蒙亮，渡船上挤满了中国人，有的是套着蓝布褂子的农民，有的是身披黑袍的老爷。他们一个个眼神古怪，脸如死灰，好像这趟渡船是把他们送到阴间去似的。等到了岸，他们下了船来，竟有些茫然地站在岸边，好像想不起来要去哪里，过了一会儿才三三两两地朝山上爬去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The door was opened and the amah explained that Kitty wished to see the Mother Superior. She was taken once more into the stiff parlour in which it seemed a window had never been opened, and here she sat so long that she began to think her message had not been delivered. At last the Mother Superior came in.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="门开了，佣人向门内的人解释说凯蒂想见见修道院长。她再一次被带到了那间令人窒息的会客室，屋里的那扇窗户似乎从来也没打开通过风似的。她坐了很长的时间也不见修道院长过来，不禁怀疑是不是她的话没有传到。终于，修道院长走了进来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Mother Superior gave her a smile, austere but sweet, and begged her to sit down. But Kitty saw that her eyes were swollen. She had been weeping. Kitty was startled, for she had received from the Mother Superior the impression that she was a woman whom earthly troubles could not greatly move.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="修道院长朝她肃然而又甜美地致以微笑，并请她坐下来。凯蒂发现她的眼睛肿了，看上去是刚刚哭过。这令凯蒂颇为惊讶，因为在她的印象中，修道院长可不是为世俗烦扰轻易动容的人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"She was one of the Sisters who came out from France with me ten years ago. There are only three of us left now. I remember, we stood in a little group at the end of the boat (what do you call it, the bow?) and as we steamed out of the harbour at Marseilles and we saw the golden figure of Sainte-Marie la Grace, we said a prayer together. It had been my greatest wish since I entered religion to be allowed to come to China, but when I saw the land grow distant I could not prevent myself from weeping. I was their Superior; it was not a very good example I was giving my daughters. And then Sister St Francis Xavier -- that is the name of the Sister who died last night -- took my hand and told me not to grieve; for wherever we were, she said, there was France and there was God."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“她是十年前随我从法国一同过来的姐妹之一。现在，那时的伙伴只剩下我们三个人了。我记得，那时我们大家站在船尾（她说什么？缠尾？），随着蒸汽轮船离开了马赛港。我们远远望见了圣母玛利亚的金色雕像，便一同念出了祈祷词。自从入教以后，我最大的希望就是教会派遣我到中国去。然而当我看到故土在我眼前远去的时候，还是忍不住哭了起来。我是她们的院长，没有给孩子们做好榜样。圣弗朗西丝·夏维姐妹——她昨晚已经死了，当时她握住我的手，让我不要悲伤。她说，无论我们走到哪里，法国和上帝都在我们心中。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"That encourages me, ma mere", said Kitty. "I have been feeling that I had come at a very unfortunate moment. You said the other day that there was more work than the Sisters could do, and I was wondering if you would allow me to come and help them. I do not mind what I do if I can only be useful. I should be thankful if you just set me to scrub the floors."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你的话激励了我，嬷嬷，”凯蒂说道，“很遗憾我在一个令人悲伤的时刻到来。那天你曾说姐妹们人手不够，我便想你能否容许我前来帮忙。只要我能对你们有用，我不在乎能帮上什么。即便你安排我擦地板，我也会十分感谢。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I have been writing to her father. She, like me, was her mother's only daughter. They were fisher folk in Brittany, and it will be hard for them. Oh, when will this terrible epidemic cease? Two of our girls have been attacked this morning and nothing but a miracle can save them. These Chinese have no resistance. The loss of Sister St Francis is very severe. There is so much to do and now fewer than ever to do it. We have Sisters at our other houses in China who are eager to come, all our Order, I think, would give anything in the world (only they have nothing) to come here; but it is almost certain death; and so long as we can manage with the Sisters we have I am unwilling that others should be sacrificed."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我刚才一直在给她的父亲写信。她和我一样，是她妈妈唯一的女儿。他们是住在布列塔尼的一家渔民，这个消息对他们来说太残酷了。呃，这场可怕的瘟疫何时才会停止？今天早上我们的两个小女孩也发病了，除了奇迹，没人能救得了她们。这些中国人没有一点抵抗力。失去圣弗朗西丝姐妹对我们来说太严酷了。我们要做的事情很多，而现在人手又少了一个。虽然中国各处修道院的姐妹们都很想赶过来，我们的教会会为这个地方奉献一切（可惜他们一无所有），但是来这里就几乎意味着死亡。只要我们现有的姐妹尚能应付下去，我绝不想再有姐妹来白白牺牲。”">查看中文翻译</div>

"My dear child, do you not think that you have done enough in coming with your husband here? That is more than many wives would have had the courage to do, and for the rest how can you be better occupied than in giving him peace and comfort when he comes home to you after the day's work? Believe me, he needs then all your love and all your consideration."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“无须由你来擦地板。那些孤儿马马虎虎也能凑合做。”她停了一下，然后十分和蔼地看着凯蒂，“我亲爱的孩子，你不觉得你随丈夫前来就已经做得够多了吗？不是每个妻子都有这个勇气。除此之外，你若能在他劳累一天回到家之后，安慰他，让他安安静静休息，就没有比这再周到的了。请相信我，那时他需要你的爱和你的体贴。”">查看中文翻译</div>
