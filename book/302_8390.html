<div class="line_en">Elinor could not find herself in the carriage with Mrs. Jennings, andbeginning a journey to London under her protection, and as her guest, without wondering at her own situation, so short had their acquaintancewith that lady been, so wholly unsuited were they in age anddisposition, and so many had been her objections against such a measureonly a few days before! But these objections had all, with that happyardour of youth which Marianne and her mother equally shared, beenovercome or overlooked; and Elinor, in spite of every occasional doubtof Willoughby's constancy, could not witness the rapture of delightfulexpectation which filled the whole soul and beamed in the eyes ofMarianne, without feeling how blank was her own prospect, how cheerlessher own state of mind in the comparison, and how gladly she wouldengage in the solicitude of Marianne's situation to have the sameanimating object in view, the same possibility of hope. A short, avery short time however must now decide what Willoughby's intentionswere; in all probability he was already in town. Marianne's eagernessto be gone declared her dependence on finding him there; and Elinor wasresolved not only upon gaining every new light as to his characterwhich her own observation or the intelligence of others could give her, but likewise upon watching his behaviour to her sister with suchzealous attention, as to ascertain what he was and what he meant, before many meetings had taken place. Should the result of herobservations be unfavourable, she was determined at all events to openthe eyes of her sister; should it be otherwise, her exertions would beof a different nature-she must then learn to avoid every selfishcomparison, and banish every regret which might lessen her satisfactionin the happiness of Marianne.</div>

<div class="line_en">They were three days on their journey, and Marianne's behaviour as theytravelled was a happy specimen of what future complaisance andcompanionableness to Mrs. Jennings might be expected to be. She sat insilence almost all the way, wrapt in her own meditations, and scarcelyever voluntarily speaking, except when any object of picturesque beautywithin their view drew from her an exclamation of delight exclusivelyaddressed to her sister. To atone for this conduct therefore, Elinortook immediate possession of the post of civility which she hadassigned herself, behaved with the greatest attention to Mrs. Jennings, talked with her, laughed with her, and listened to her whenever shecould; and Mrs. Jennings on her side treated them both with allpossible kindness, was solicitous on every occasion for their ease andenjoyment, and only disturbed that she could not make them choose theirown dinners at the inn, nor extort a confession of their preferringsalmon to cod, or boiled fowls to veal cutlets. They reached town bythree o'clock the third day, glad to be released, after such a journey, from the confinement of a carriage, and ready to enjoy all the luxuryof a good fire.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I am NOT going to write to my mother," replied Marianne, hastily, andas if wishing to avoid any farther inquiry. Elinor said no more; itimmediately struck her that she must then be writing to Willoughby; andthe conclusion which as instantly followed was, that, howevermysteriously they might wish to conduct the affair, they must beengaged. This conviction, though not entirely satisfactory, gave herpleasure, and she continued her letter with greater alacrity. Marianne's was finished in a very few minutes; in length it could be nomore than a note; it was then folded up, sealed, and directed witheager rapidity. Elinor thought she could distinguish a large W in thedirection; and no sooner was it complete than Marianne, ringing thebell, requested the footman who answered it to get that letter conveyedfor her to the two-penny post. This decided the matter at once.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不是给母亲写信，”玛丽安急忙答道，好像要避开她的进一步追问似的。埃丽诺没有作声。她顿时意识到，妹妹准是在给威洛比写信。她随即得出这样的结论：不管他们俩想把事情搞得多么神秘，他们肯定是订了婚。这个结论虽然并非令人完全信服，但是使她感到高兴，于是她更加欢快迅捷地继续写信。玛丽安的信没几分钟就写好了。从长度上看，那只不过是封短柬。接着，她急急忙忙地叠起来、封好，写上收信人的姓名地址。埃丽诺想，从那姓名地址上，她准能辨出一个诺大的“威”字。信刚完成，玛丽安就连忙拉铃，等男仆闻声赶来，就请他替她把信送到两便士邮局。顿时，这事便确定无疑了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a great satisfaction to Elinor that Mrs. Jennings, by being muchengaged in her own room, could see little of what was passing. The teathings were brought in, and already had Marianne been disappointed morethan once by a rap at a neighbouring door, when a loud one was suddenlyheard which could not be mistaken for one at any other house, Elinorfelt secure of its announcing Willoughby's approach, and Marianne, starting up, moved towards the door. Every thing was silent; thiscould not be borne many seconds; she opened the door, advanced a fewsteps towards the stairs, and after listening half a minute, returnedinto the room in all the agitation which a conviction of having heardhim would naturally produce; in the ecstasy of her feelings at thatinstant she could not help exclaiming, "Oh, Elinor, it is Willoughby, indeed it is!" and seemed almost ready to throw herself into his arms, when Colonel Brandon appeared.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was too great a shock to be borne with calmness, and she immediatelyleft the room. Elinor was disappointed too; but at the same time herregard for Colonel Brandon ensured his welcome with her; and she feltparticularly hurt that a man so partial to her sister should perceivethat she experienced nothing but grief and disappointment in seeinghim. She instantly saw that it was not unnoticed by him, that he evenobserved Marianne as she quitted the room, with such astonishment andconcern, as hardly left him the recollection of what civility demandedtowards herself.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他这句话，以及他说这句话的那副神态，顿时使埃丽诺想起了他当初离开巴顿时的情景，想起了这些情景给詹宁斯太太带来的不安和怀疑。埃丽诺有点担心：她的提问会让人觉得她对这个问题很好奇，实际上她并没有那么好奇。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In this calm kind of way, with very little interest on either side, they continued to talk, both of them out of spirits, and the thoughtsof both engaged elsewhere. Elinor wished very much to ask whetherWilloughby were then in town, but she was afraid of giving him pain byany enquiry after his rival; and at length, by way of saying something, she asked if he had been in London ever since she had seen him last."Yes," he replied, with some embarrassment, "almost ever since; I havebeen once or twice at Delaford for a few days, but it has never been inmy power to return to Barton."</div>

<div class="line_en">It was late in the morning before they returned home; and no sooner hadthey entered the house than Marianne flew eagerly up stairs, and whenElinor followed, she found her turning from the table with a sorrowfulcountenance, which declared that no Willoughby had been there.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Has no letter been left here for me since we went out?" said she tothe footman who then entered with the parcels. She was answered in thenegative. "Are you quite sure of it?" she replied. "Are you certainthat no servant, no porter has left any letter or note?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们出去以后，没有人给我来信吗？”她对恰在这时进来送邮包的男仆说道。她得到的回答是没有。“你十分肯定吗？”她问道。“你敢肯定佣人、脚夫都没进来送过信或是便条？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"How odd, indeed!" repeated Elinor within herself, regarding her sisterwith uneasiness. "If she had not known him to be in town she would nothave written to him, as she did; she would have written to Combe Magna; and if he is in town, how odd that he should neither come nor write! Oh! my dear mother, you must be wrong in permitting an engagementbetween a daughter so young, a man so little known, to be carried on inso doubtful, so mysterious a manner! I long to inquire; and how willMY interference be borne."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“真怪呀！”埃丽诺自言自语地重复道，局促不安地打量着妹妹。“假使她不知道他在城里，她决不会给他写信，而只会往库姆大厦写信。他要是在城里，却既不来人又不写信，岂非咄咄怪事！呕，亲爱的母亲，你真不该允许这么年轻的—个女儿跟这么毫不了解的一个男人订婚，而且搞得这么捉摸不定，神秘莫测，我倒真想追问追问，可是人家怎么能容忍我多管闲事呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She determined, after some consideration, that if appearances continuedmany days longer as unpleasant as they now were, she would represent inthe strongest manner to her mother the necessity of some seriousenquiry into the affair.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mrs. Palmer and two elderly ladies of Mrs. Jennings's intimateacquaintance, whom she had met and invited in the morning, dined withthem. The former left them soon after tea to fulfill her eveningengagements; and Elinor was obliged to assist in making a whist tablefor the others. Marianne was of no use on these occasions, as shewould never learn the game; but though her time was therefore at herown disposal, the evening was by no means more productive of pleasureto her than to Elinor, for it was spent in all the anxiety ofexpectation and the pain of disappointment. She sometimes endeavouredfor a few minutes to read; but the book was soon thrown aside, and shereturned to the more interesting employment of walking backwards andforwards across the room, pausing for a moment whenever she came to thewindow, in hopes of distinguishing the long-expected rap.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="帕尔默夫人，还有詹宁斯太太上午遇见时邀请的两位关系密切的上了年纪的太太，同她们共进晚餐。帕尔默夫人茶后不久便起身告辞，去履行晚上的约会。埃丽诺好心好意地帮助大伙摆惠斯特牌桌。在这种情况下，玛丽安帮不上手，因为她说什么也不肯学打牌。不过，虽说她因此可以自由支配自己的时间，但她整个晚上决不比埃丽诺过得更快活，因为她一直在忍受着期待的焦虑和失望的痛苦。她有时硬着头皮读几分钟书，但是很快又把书抛开，比较有趣的，还是重新在室内踱来踱去，每当走到窗口总要停一阵，希望能听到期盼已久的敲门声。">查看中文翻译</div>
