<div class="line_en">When about 16 years of age I happened to meet with a book, written by one Tryon, recommending a vegetable diet. I determined to go into it. My brother, being yet unmarried, did not keep house, but boarded himself and his apprentices in another family. My refusing to eat flesh occasioned an inconveniency, and I was frequently chid for my singularity. I made myself acquainted with Tryon's manner of preparing some of his dishes, such as boiling potatoes or rice, making hasty pudding, and a few others, and then proposed to my brother, that if he would give me, weekly, half the money he paid for my board, I would board myself. He instantly agreed to it, and I presently found that I could save half what he paid me. This was an additional fund for buying books. But I had another advantage in it. My brother and the rest going from the printing-house to their meals, I remained there alone, and, despatching presently my light repast, which often was no more than a bisket or a slice of bread, a handful of raisins or a tart from the pastry-cook's, and a glass of water, had the rest of the time till their return for study, in which I made the greater progress, from that greater clearness of head and quicker apprehension which usually attend temperance in eating and drinking.</div>

<div class="line_en">And now it was that, being on some occasion made asham'd of my ignorance in figures, which I had twice failed in learning when at school, I took Cocker's book of Arithmetick, and went through the whole by myself with great ease. I also read Seller's and Shermy's books of Navigation, and became acquainted with the little geometry they contain; but never proceeded far in that science. And I read about this time Locke On Human Understanding, and the Art of Thinking, by Messrs. du Port Royal.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="以前在某事上我因不谙算术而感到羞愧，我在学校时算术曾两次不及格，因此这时候我拿了考克氏的算术书，自己从头到尾很顺利地学习了一遍。我也读了舍勒和斯图美关于航海的书籍，熟悉了这些书里所包含的一点几何学。除了这一点以外，我对几何学从未作过更深入的研究。约在这个时候，我读了洛克的《人类悟性论》和波尔洛亚尔派的先生们所著的《思维术》。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">While I was intent on improving my language, I met with an English grammar (I think it was Greenwood's), at the end of which there were two little sketches of the arts of rhetoric and logic, the latter finishing with a specimen of a dispute in the Socratic method; and soon after I procur'd Xenophon's Memorable Things of Socrates, wherein there are many instances of the same method. I was charm'd with it, adopted it, dropt my abrupt contradiction and positive argumentation, and put on the humble inquirer and doubter. And being then, from reading Shaftesbury and Collins, become a real doubter in many points of our religious doctrine, I found this method safest for myself and very embarrassing to those against whom I used it; therefore I took a delight in it, practis'd it continually, and grew very artful and expert in drawing people, even of superior knowledge, into concessions, the consequences of which they did not foresee, entangling them in difficulties out of which they could not extricate themselves, and so obtaining victories that neither myself nor my cause always deserved. I continu'd this method some few years, but gradually left it, retaining only the habit of expressing myself in terms of modest diffidence; never using, when I advanced any thing that may possibly be disputed, the words certainly, undoubtedly, or any others that give the air of positiveness to an opinion; but rather say, I conceive or apprehend a thing to be so and so; it appears to me, or I should think it so or so, for such and such reasons; or I imagine it to be so; or it is so, if I am not mistaken. This habit, I believe, has been of great advantage to me when I have had occasion to inculcate my opinions, and persuade men into measures that I have been from time to time engag'd in promoting; and, as the chief ends of conversation are to inform or to be informed, to please or to persuade, I wish well-meaning, sensible men would not lessen their power of doing good by a positive, assuming manner, that seldom fails to disgust, tends to create opposition, and to defeat every one of those purposes for which speech was given to us, to wit, giving or receiving information or pleasure. For, if you would inform, a positive and dogmatical manner in advancing your sentiments may provoke contradiction and prevent a candid attention. If you wish information and improvement from the knowledge of others, and yet at the same time express yourself as firmly fix'd in your present opinions, modest, sensible men, who do not love disputation, will probably leave you undisturbed in the possession of your error. And by such a manner, you can seldom hope to recommend yourself in pleasing your hearers, or to persuade those whose concurrence you desire. Pope says, judiciously:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="正当我一心一意地在改进我的文体的时候，我偶然发现了一本英语语法（我想是一本格林乌的语法），在这本书的后面有两篇关于修辞法和逻辑的简短介绍，关于逻辑的那篇在结束时举了一个用苏格拉底对话法进行论辩的实例。此后不久我就买了一部色诺芬的《苏格拉底的重要言行录》。在这本书里有许多这种对话法的实例。我很喜欢这种方法，就采用它，放弃了我那生硬反驳和独断式的立论，却装成一个谦逊的发问和怀疑的人。在当时读了莎夫茨贝利和柯令斯的作品以后，我对于我们的教义的许多地方成为一个真正的怀疑者。我发现用这种方法对我自己是最稳妥的，但却使我的对手十分为难。因此我喜爱这种方法，不断地应用它，逐渐变得十分巧妙和老练，使人们，即使是有学问修养的人，也不得不让步，而这种让步的后果又不是他们所能预知的，这样便引诱他们进入种种他们无法自拔的窘境，而使得我自己和我的论题常常获得非所应得的胜利。这个方法我继续使用了几年之久，但是后来逐渐放弃了它，仅仅保留了用谦逊的口吻表示我个人意见的习惯。当我提出任何可能有争论的意见时，我从不用“一定”、“无疑地”或任何其他表示肯定意见的字眼。相反的，我猜想或料想某事是如此如此，为了什么什么理由，在我看来这件事好像是，或是我想是这么这么。或是说我想象这是这样，或是说：假如我没有弄错的话，这是如此。我相信这个习惯对我非常有益，因为我需要说服人，劝人接受我不时在努力提倡的各种措施。再说，谈话的主要目的无非是教诲人，或是被别人教诲，使人高兴或是说服人，因此我奉劝善良的聪明人，为了不削弱他们行善的能力，切勿采取一种独断式的、自以为是的态度。这种态度总是使人起反感，往往引起别人的反对，因而使语言之所以存在的目的（就是交流思想和增进感情的目的）破坏无遗，因为假如你的目的是在要教诲人，讲话时过分自信的武断态度有时会引起反驳，因而使公正的讨论成为不可能。假如你的目的是要从别人的知识经验中吸取教训和教益，而同时你又坚定不移地表示你的意见，那么谦逊明达的人，由于不爱争辩，很可能会不屑指出你的错误，让你依然故我。同时，用这种态度，你很难希望能使你谈话的对方喜悦，或是赢得别人的赞同。蒲柏说得很好：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">My brother had, in 1720 or 1721, begun to print a newspaper. It was the second that appeared in America, and was called the New England Courant. The only one before it was the Boston News-Letter. I remember his being dissuaded by some of his friends from the undertaking, as not likely to succeed, one newspaper being, in their udgment, enough for America. At this time (1771) there are not less than five-and-twenty. He went on, however, with the undertaking, and after having worked in composing the types and printing off the sheets, I was employed to carry the papers thro' the streets to the customers.</div>

<div class="line_en">He had some ingenious men among his friends, who amus'd themselves by writing little pieces for this paper, which gain'd it credit and made it more in demand, and these gentlemen often visited us. Hearing their conversations, and their accounts of the approbation their papers were received with, I was excited to try my hand among them; but, being still a boy, and suspecting that my brother would object to printing anything of mine in his paper if he knew it to be mine, I contrived to disguise my hand, and, writing an anonymous paper, I put it in at night under the door of the printing-house. It was found in the morning, and communicated to his writing friends when they call'd in as usual. They read it, commented on it in my hearing, and I had the exquisite pleasure of finding it met with their approbation, and that, in their different guesses at the author, none were named but men of some character among us for learning and ingenuity. I suppose now that I was rather lucky in my judges, and that perhaps they were not really so very good ones as I then esteem'd them.</div>

<div class="line_en">Encourag'd, however, by this, I wrote and convey'd in the same way to the press several more papers which were equally approv'd; and I kept my secret till my small fund of sense for such performances was pretty well exhausted and then I discovered it, when I began to be considered a little more by my brother's acquaintance, and in a manner that did not quite please him, as he thought, probably with reason, that it tended to make me too vain. And, perhaps, this might be one occasion of the differences that we began to have about this time. Though a brother, he considered himself as my master, and me as his apprentice, and accordingly, expected the same services from me as he would from another, while I thought he demean'd me too much in some he requir'd of me, who from a brother expected more indulgence. Our disputes were often brought before our father, and I fancy I was either generally in the right, or else a better pleader, because the judgment was generally in my favor. But my brother was passionate, and had often beaten me, which I took extreamly amiss; and, thinking my apprenticeship very tedious, I was continually wishing for some opportunity of shortening it, which at length offered in a manner unexpected.</div>

<div class="line_en">One of the pieces in our newspaper on some political point, which I have now forgotten, gave offense to the Assembly.

<div class="line_en">There was a consultation held in our printing-house among his friends, what he should do in this case. Some proposed to evade the order by changing the name of the paper; but my brother, seeing inconveniences in that, it was finally concluded on as a better way, to let it be printed for the future under the name of BENJAMIN FRANKLIN; and to avoid the censure of the Assembly, that might fall on him as still printing it by his apprentice, the contrivance was that my old indenture should be return'd to me, with a full discharge on the back of it, to be shown on occasion, but to secure to him the benefit of my service, I was to sign new indentures for the remainder of the term, which were to be kept private.

<div class="line_en">When he found I would leave him, he took care to prevent my getting employment in any other printing-house of the town, by going round and speaking to every master, who accordingly refus'd to give me work. I then thought of going to New York, as the nearest place where there was a printer; and I was rather inclin'd to leave Boston when I reflected that I had already made myself a little obnoxious to the governing party, and, from the arbitrary proceedings of the Assembly in my brother's case, it was likely I might, if I stay'd, soon bring myself into scrapes; and farther, that my indiscrete disputations about religion began to make me pointed at with horror by good people as an infidel or atheist. I determin'd on the point, but my father now siding with my brother, I was sensible that, if I attempted to go openly, means would be used to prevent me. My friend Collins, therefore, undertook to manage a little for me. He agreed with the captain of a New York sloop for my passage, under the notion of my being a young acquaintance of his, that had got a naughty girl with child, whose friends would compel me to marry her, and therefore I could not appear or come away publicly. So I sold some of my books to raise a little money, was taken on board privately, and as we had a fair wind, in three days I found myself in New York, near 300 miles from home, a boy of but 17, without the least recommendation to, or knowledge of any person in the place, and with very little money in my pocket.</div>

He could give me no employment, having little to do, and help enough already; but says he, "My son at Philadelphia has lately lost his principal hand, Aquila Rose, by death; if you go thither, I believe he may employ you."

<div class="line_en">In crossing the bay, we met with a squall that tore our rotten sails to pieces, prevented our getting into the Kill and drove us upon Long Island. In our way, a drunken Dutchman, who was a passenger too, fell overboard; when he was sinking, I reached through the water to his shock pate, and drew him up, so that we got him in again. His ducking sobered him a little, and he went to sleep, taking first out of his pocket a book, which he desir'd I would dry for him. It proved to be my old favorite author, Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress, in Dutch, finely printed on good paper, with copper cuts, a dress better than I had ever seen it wear in its own language. I have since found that it has been translated into most of the languages of Europe, and suppose it has been more generally read than any other book, except perhaps the Bible.</div>

<div class="line_en">Honest John was the first that I know of who mix'd narration and dialogue; a method of writing very engaging to the reader, who in the most interesting parts finds himself, as it were, brought into the company and present at the discourse. De Foe in his Cruso, his Moll Flanders, Religious Courtship, Family Instructor, and other pieces, has imitated it with success; and Richardson has done the same, in his Pamela, etc.</div>

<div class="line_en">When we drew near the island, we found it was at a place where there could be no landing, there being a great surff on the stony beach. So we dropt anchor, and swung around towards the shore. Some people came down to the water edge and hallow'd to us, as we did to them; but the wind was so high, and the surff so loud, that we could not hear so as to understand each other. There were canoes on the shore, and we made signs, and hallow'd that they should fetch us; but they either did not understand us, or thought it impracticable, so they went away, and night coming on, we had no remedy but to wait till the wind should abate; and, in the meantime, the boatman and I concluded to sleep, if we could; and so crowded into the scuttle, with the Dutchman, who was still wet, and the spray beating over the head of our boat, leak'd thro' to us, so that we were soon almost as wet as he. In this manner we lay all night, with very little rest; but, the wind abating the next day, we made a shift to reach Amboy before night, having been thirty hours on the water, without victuals, or any drink but a bottle of filthy rum, and the water we sail'd on being salt.</div>

I cut so miserable a figure, too, that I found, by the questions ask'd me, I was suspected to be some runaway servant, and in danger of being taken up on that suspicion. However, I proceeded the next day, and got in the evening to an inn, within eight or ten miles of Burlington, kept by one Dr. Brown. He entered into conversation with me while I took some refreshment, and, finding I had read a little, became very sociable and friendly. Our acquaintance continu'd as long as he liv'd. He had been, I imagine, an itinerant doctor, for there was no town in England, or country in Europe, of which he could not give a very particular account. He had some letters, and was ingenious, but much of an unbeliever, and wickedly undertook, some years after, to travestie the Bible in doggrel verse, as Cotton had done Virgil. By this means he set many of the facts in a very ridiculous light, and might have hurt weak minds if his work had been published; but it never was.</div>

She invited me to lodge at her house till a passage by water should offer; and being tired with my foot travelling, I accepted the invitation. She understanding I was a printer, would have had me stay at that town and follow my business, being ignorant of the stock necessary to begin with. She was very hospitable, gave me a dinner of ox-cheek with great good will, accepting only a pot of ale in return; and I thought myself fixed till Tuesday should come. However, walking in the evening by the side of the river, a boat came by, which I found was going towards Philadelphia, with several people in her. They took me in, and, as there was no wind, we row'd all the way; and about midnight, not having yet seen the city, some of the company were confident we must have passed it, and would row no farther; the others knew not where we were; so we put toward the shore, got into a creek, landed near an old fence, with the rails of which we made a fire, the night being cold, in October, and there we remained till daylight. Then one of the company knew the place to be Cooper's Creek, a little above Philadelphia, which we saw as soon as we got out of the creek, and arriv'd there about eight or nine o'clock on the Sunday morning, and landed at the Market-street wharf.</div>

I was in my working dress, my best cloaths being to come round by sea. I was dirty from my journey; my pockets were stuff'd out with shirts and stockings, and I knew no soul nor where to look for lodging. I was fatigued with travelling, rowing, and want of rest, I was very hungry; and my whole stock of cash consisted of a Dutch dollar, and about a shilling in copper. The latter I gave the people of the boat for my passage, who at first refus'd it, on account of my rowing; but I insisted on their taking it.

<div class="line_en">Then I walked up the street, gazing about till near the market-house I met a boy with bread. I had made many a meal on bread, and, inquiring where he got it, I went immediately to the baker's he directed me to, in Secondstreet, and ask'd for bisket, intending such as we had in Boston; but they, it seems, were not made in Philadelphia. Then I asked for a threepenny loaf, and was told they had none such. So not considering or knowing the difference of money, and the greater cheapness nor the names of his bread, I made him give me three-penny worth of any sort. He gave me, accordingly, three great puffy rolls. I was surpriz'd at the quantity, but took it, and, having no room in my pockets, walk'd off with a roll under each arm, and eating the other. Thus I went up Market-street as far as Fourth-street, passing by the door of Mr. Read, my future wife's father; when she, standing at the door, saw me, and thought I made, as I certainly did, a most awkward, ridiculous appearance. Then I turned and went down Chestnut-street and part of Walnut-street, eating my roll all the way, and, corning round, found myself again at Market-street wharf, near the boat I came in, to which I went for a draught of the river water; and, being filled with one of my rolls, gave the other two to a woman and her child that came down the river in the boat with us, and were waiting to go farther.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着我上了街，四处浏览，当我走到市场时，我遇见了一个手拿着面包的男孩子。以前我曾经好几次把面包当饭吃过。我问过他面包是从哪儿买来的以后，我立即跑到他指点给我的在第二街的一家面包铺那里，我要像我们在波士顿买的那种硬面包，但是好像在费城他们不做这种面包。接着我就要三便士一只的面包，他们也说没有，这样，由于我没有考虑到或不知道货币价值的不同，在费城物价较低，我也不知道究竟他铺子里有什么面包，我就请他给我三便士任何种类的面包，于是，他给了我三个又大又肥的面包卷。这个数量使我感到惊异，但是我收了下来。因为我口袋里装不下，我就两胁下各夹着一个，一边走，一边嘴里吃着另外的一个，我就这样沿着市场街走去一直走到第四街，经过后来成为我岳丈的李得先生门口。我未来的爱人这时恰巧站在门口，看见了我，觉得我的样子十分尴尬可笑，事实也真是这样。接着，我转了一个弯，到了板栗街和胡桃街的一段，一路上我仍然吃着面包卷，又转了一个弯以后，发现我又回到了市场街码头，我刚在坐着来的那只船的附近。我跑到码头上去喝了一口河水。我既吃了一个面包卷，肚子已经饱了，就把其余的两个给了跟我们一同从上江坐船来的妇人和她的孩子，她们正等着开船继续前进。">查看中文翻译</div>

Keimer made verses too, but very indifferently. He could not be said to write them, for his manner was to compose them in the types directly out of his head.

At length, an incident happened that sent me back again much sooner than I had intended. I had a brother-in-law, Robert Holmes, master of a sloop that traded between Boston and Delaware. He being at Newcastle, forty miles below Philadelphia, heard there of me, and wrote me a letter mentioning the concern of my friends in Boston at my abrupt departure, assuring me of their good will to me, and that every thing would be accommodated to my mind if I would return, to which he exhorted me very earnestly.

<div class="line_en">Keimer ran down immediately, thinking it a visit to him; but the governor inquir'd for me, came up, and with a condescension of politeness I had been quite unus'd to, made me many compliments, desired to be acquainted with me, blam'd me kindly for not having made myself known to him when I first came to the place, and would have me away with him to the tavern, where he was going with Colonel French to taste, as he said, some excellent Madeira. I was not a little surprised, and Keimer star'd like a pig poison'd. I went, however, with the governor and Colonel French to a tavern, at the corner of Third-street, and over the Madeira he propos'd my setting up my business, laid before me the probabilities of success, and both he and Colonel French assur'd me I should have their interest and influence in procuring the public business of both governments. On my doubting whether my father would assist me in it, Sir William said he would give me a letter to him, in which he would state the advantages, and he did not doubt of prevailing with him. So it was concluded I should return to Boston in the first vessel, with the governor's letter recommending me to my father. In the mean time the intention was to be kept a secret, and I went on working with Keimer as usual, the governor sending for me now and then to dine with him, a very great honor I thought it, and conversing with me in the most affable, familiar, and friendly manner imaginable.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凯谋立刻跑下楼去，以为是来访他的客人，但是州长要见我，跑到楼上来，他用了一种我以前不大习惯的谦逊彬彬有礼地向我说了许多客气话，表示愿意与我相识，好意地怪我当我初来费城时为什么不让他知道，同时邀我和他一同到酒馆去，他和富兰契上校原是打算上那里，据他说，去品尝一些上等的白葡萄酒。我是受宠若惊，凯谋却瞪着眼呆若木鸡。但是我陪着州长和富兰契上校到一家在第三街拐角上的酒馆去了，一面喝酒，他一面劝我自己开业，向我指出成功的可能性很大，州长和富兰契上校都向我保证他们要利用他们的势力和影响去招揽军政两方面的公家生意。当我提出不知道我父亲愿意不愿意在这件事上协助我的时候，威廉爵士说他要给我一封写给我父亲的信，在信里他要叙述这一计划的优点，他确信他一定能说服他。事情就这样决定了：我将搭坐下一班的船带着州长向我父亲推荐我的信，回到波士顿去。但在其间我们的计划暂不宣布，我照常在凯谋的印刷铺继续工作，州长不时邀我去吃饭（当时我想这是一种莫大的光荣），同时他用一种想象不到的殷勤、亲密和友好的态度跟我谈话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sir William Keith, governor of the province, was then at Newcastle, and Captain Holmes, happening to be in company with him when my letter came to hand, spoke to him of me, and show'd him the letter. The governor read it, and seem'd surpris'd when he was told my age. He said I appear'd a young man of promising parts, and therefore should be encouraged; the printers at Philadelphia were wretched ones; and, if I would set up there, he made no doubt I should succeed; for his part, he would procure me the public business, and do me every other service in his power. This my brother-in-law afterwards told me in Boston, but I knew as yet nothing of it; when, one day, Keimer and I being at work together near the window, we saw the governor and another gentleman (which proved to be Colonel French, of Newcastle), finely dress'd, come directly across the street to our house, and heard them at the door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="宾夕法尼亚的州长威廉·基夫爵士这时在纽开色。当我的信送到时，荷麦斯船主刚巧跟州长在一起，就跟他谈起了我，并把我的信给他看了。州长看了我的信，当他听到我的年龄时，好像感到惊异。他说看来我是一个有前途的有才能的青年，因此应当加以鼓励。他说费城的印刷铺质量十分低劣，假如我在那里开业，他说我一定会发达。在他这一方面他愿意设法替我招揽公家印刷生意，并在任何其他方面尽力帮助我。这是我姐夫以后在波士顿讲给我听的，但在当时我还一无所知。有一天，当我和凯谋一块儿在窗口工作的时候，我们看见州长和另外一位绅士（后来知道他是纽开色的富兰契上校）穿着华丽的衣服，穿过街径向我们的铺子走过来，接着我们听见了叩门声。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">About the end of April, 1724, a little vessel offer'd for Boston. I took leave of Keimer as going to see my friends. The governor gave me an ample letter, saying many flattering things of me to my father, and strongly recommending the project of my setting up at Philadelphia as a thing that must make my fortune. We struck on a shoal in going down the bay, and sprung a leak; we had a blustering time at sea, and were oblig'd to pump almost continually, at which I took my turn. We arriv'd safe, however, at Boston in about a fortnight. I had been absent seven months, and my friends had heard nothing of me; for my br. Holmes was not yet return'd, and had not written about me. My unexpected appearance surpriz'd the family; all were, however, very glad to see me, and made me welcome, except my brother. I went to see him at his printing-house. I was better dress'd than ever while in his service, having a genteel new suit from head to foot, a watch, and my pockets lin'd with near five pounds sterling in silver. He receiv'd me not very frankly, look'd me all over, and turn'd to his work again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="约在一七二四年四月底，一只开往波士顿的小船来了，我辞别了凯谋，只说是去访友。州长给我一封厚厚的信，信中向我父亲说了许多恭维我的话，大力地推荐我在费城开业的计划，认为这一事业必然会使我发迹。我们的船在驶入海湾时碰上了沙洲，发生了裂缝，这时候海上波涛汹涌，我们必须几乎继续不停地抽水，我也轮流值班抽水。但是，大约经过了两个星期的时光，我们平安地到达了波士顿。到那时我已经离开波城七个月了，我的亲友们一点也没有听到关于我的消息，因为我姐夫荷麦斯还没有回来，也没有写信提到我。我之意外地出现在他们面前，使得全家惊异，但是大家看到我都很快乐。除了我哥哥外，大家都款待我。我到他的印刷铺里去看他。这时我的衣着比我在他那里当学徒期间的任何时候都考究。我从头到脚穿了一套新的时髦的西装，挂了一只表，口袋里装了差不多五英镑的银币。他勉强地接见了我，把我从头到脚打量了一番，然后又去工作去了。">查看中文翻译</div>
