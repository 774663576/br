<div class="line_en">I didn't turn it off right away, though. I just kept laying there on Ely's bed, thinking about Jane and all. It just drove me stark staring mad when I thought about her and Stradlater parked somewhere in that fat-assed Ed Banky's car. Every time I thought about it, I felt like jumping out the window. The thing is, you didn't know Stradlater. I knew him. Most guys at Pencey just talked about having sexual intercourse with girls all the time -- like Ackley, for instance -- but old Stradlater really did it. I was personally acquainted with at least two girls he gave the time to. That's the truth.</div>

<div class="line_en">A couple of minutes later, he was snoring like mad. I kept laying there in the dark anyway, though, trying not to think about old Jane and Stradlater in that goddam Ed Banky's car. But it was almost impossible. The trouble was, I knew that guy Stradlater's technique. That made it even worse. We once double-dated, in Ed Banky's car, and Stradlater was in the back, with his date, and I was in the front with mine. What a technique that guy had. What he'd do was, he'd start snowing his date in this very quiet, sincere voice -- like as if he wasn't only a very handsome guy but a nice, sincere guy, too. I damn near puked, listening to him. His date kept saying, "No -- please. Please, don't. Please." But old Stradlater kept snowing her in this Abraham Lincoln, sincere voice, and finally there'd be this terrific silence in the back of the car. It was really embarrassing. I don't think he gave that girl the time that night -- but damn near. Damn near.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一两分钟以后，他就象个疯子似的打起鼾来。我仍旧躺在黑暗中，竭力不让自己去想琴和斯特拉德莱塔一同在埃德。班基那辆混帐汽车里的事，可那简直办不到。糟糕的是，我熟悉斯特拉德莱塔这家伙的花招。这就叫我心里越发受不了。有一次我们俩一块儿跟女朋友约会，在埃德。班基的汽车里，斯特拉德莱塔跟他的女朋友在后座，我跟我的女朋友在前座。瞧这家伙的花招。他开始用一种极其温柔、极其诚恳的声音跟他的女朋友甜言蜜语――好象他不仅是个非常漂亮的小伙子，而且也是个挺好、挺诚恳的小伙子。我听着他说话，差点儿都呕出来了。他的女朋友不住地说：“别――劳驾啦。别这样。劳驾啦。”可老斯特拉德莱塔始终用他那种亚伯莱罕姆。林肯般的诚恳声音跟她甜言蜜语，到最后那后座上只是一片可怕的寂静。那情况可真恼人。我想那天晚上他还不至于跟那姑娘干那事儿――不过也他妈的相差不远了。真他妈的相差不远了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Everybody was asleep or out or home for the week end, and it was very, very quiet and depressing in the corridor. There was this empty box of Kolynos toothpaste outside Leahy and Hoffman's door, and while I walked down towards the stairs, I kept giving it a boot with this sheeplined slipper I had on. What I thought I'd do, I thought I might go down and see what old Mal Brossard was doing. But all of a sudden, I changed my mind. All of a sudden, I decided what I'd really do, I'd get the hell out of Pencey -- right that same night and all. I mean not wait till Wednesday or anything. I just didn't want to hang around any more. It made me too sad and lonesome. So what I decided to do, I decided I'd take a room in a hotel in New York -- some very inexpensive hotel and all -- and just take it easy till Wednesday. Then, on Wednesday, I'd go home all rested up and feeling swell. I figured my parents probably wouldn't get old Thurmer's letter saying I'd been given the ax till maybe Tuesday or Wednesday.</div>

<div class="line_en">After I got all packed, I sort of counted my dough. I don't remember exactly how much I had, but I was pretty loaded. My grandmother'd just sent me a wad about a week before. I have this grandmother that's quite lavish with her dough. She doesn't have all her marbles any more -- she's old as hell -- and she keeps sending me money for my birthday about four times a year. Anyway, even though I was pretty loaded, I figured I could always use a few extra bucks. You never know. So what I did was, I went down the hall and woke up Frederick Woodruff, this guy I'd lent my typewriter to. I asked him how much he'd give me for it. He was a pretty wealthy guy. He said he didn't know. He said he didn't much want to buy it. Finally he bought it, though. It cost about ninety bucks, and all he bought it for was twenty. He was sore because I'd woke him up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我收拾停当以后，又数了数钱。我已记不起到底有多少钱，反正数目很不小。我祖母在约莫一个星期前刚给我汇来一笔钱。我的这个祖母使起钱来手头很阔。她已经老糊涂了――老得不能再老――一年内总要寄给我四次钱，作为生日礼物。可是，尽管我现有的钱数目已经不小，我还怕不够，生怕有什么不时之需。所以我走下楼去，喊醒了法莱德里克。伍德鲁夫，就是借我打字机的家伙。我问他肯出多少钱把我的打字机买下来。这家伙相当有钱，他说他不知道，还说他不怎么想买。可他最后还是买下来了。这架打字机约莫值九十块钱，可他只给我二十块就买下了。他很没好气，因为我叫醒了他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One thing about packing depressed me a little. I had to pack these brand-new ice skates my mother had practically just sent me a couple of days before. That depressed me. I could see my mother going in Spaulding's and asking the salesman a million dopy questions -- and here I was getting the ax again. It made me feel pretty sad. She bought me the wrong kind of skates -- I wanted racing skates and she bought hockey -- but it made me sad anyway. Almost every time somebody gives me a present, it ends up making me sad.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="收拾行李时，有一件事有点儿叫我难过。我得把我母亲刚在几天前寄给我的那双崭新的冰鞋装起来；这使我心里难过。我想象得出我母亲怎样到期保尔丁商店里，向售货员问了百万个傻里傻气的问题――可我这下又给开除了。这使我觉得很伤心。她把冰鞋买错了――我要的是跑刀，她给我买了花样刀――可我照样觉得伤心。几几乎每次都是这样，每逢有人送我什么礼物，到头来都会让我觉得伤心。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Anyway, that's what I decided I'd do. So I went back to the room and turned on the light, to start packing and all. I already had quite a few things packed. Old Stradlater didn't even wake up. I lit a cigarette and got all dressed and then I packed these two Gladstones I have. It only took me about two minutes. I'm a very rapid packer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="嗯，这就是我打定主意要做的。我于是回到屋里，开亮灯，开始收拾东西。有不少东西我都已收拾好了。老斯特拉德莱塔甚至都没醒来。我点了支香烟，穿好衣服，动手整理我的两只手提皮箱。我只花了两分钟。我收拾起东西来速度快得惊人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When I was all set to go, when I had my bags and all, I stood for a while next to the stairs and took a last look down the goddam corridor. I was sort of crying. I don't know why. I put my red hunting hat on, and turned the peak around to the back, the way I liked it, and then I yelled at the top of my goddam voice, "Sleep tight, ya morons!" I'll bet I woke up every bastard on the whole floor. Then I got the hell out. Some stupid guy had thrown peanut shells all over the stairs, and I damn near broke my crazy neck.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我拿了手提箱什么的准备动身，还在楼梯口站了一会儿，顺着那条混帐走廊望了最后一眼。不知怎的，我几乎哭了出来。我戴上我那顶红色猎人帽，照我喜欢的样子将鸭舌转到脑后，然后使出了我的全身力气大声喊道：“好好睡吧，你们这些窝囊废！”我敢打赌我把这一层楼的所有杂种全都喊醒了。随后我就离开了那地方，不知哪个混蛋在楼梯上扔了一地花生皮，我他妈的差点儿摔断了我的混帐脖子。">查看中文翻译</div>
