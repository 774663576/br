<div class="line_en">But there was a quality of courage in Mrs. Garstin which in itself was admirable. She let no one in her immediate circle, which to her was the world, see how mortified she was by the frustration of her hopes. She made no change in her style of living. By careful management she was able to give as showy dinners as she had done before, and she met her friends with the same bright gaiety which she had so long cultivated. She had a hard and facile fund of chit-chat which in the society she moved in passed for conversation. She was a useful guest among persons to whom small talk did not come easily, for she was never at a loss with a new topic and could be trusted immediately to break an awkward silence with a suitable observation.</div>

<div class="line_en">Meanwhile she had the satisfaction of seeing him appointed Recorder of a Welsh town. But it was on her daughters that she set her hopes. By arranging good marriages for them she expected to make up for all the disappointments of her career. There were two, Kitty and Doris. Doris gave no sign of good looks, her nose was too long and her figure was lumpy; so that Mrs. Garstin could hope no more for her than that she should marry a young man who was well off in a suitable profession.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="与此同时，她预料他有可能受聘为威尔士某镇的刑事法官，但她还是把希望全部寄托在了女儿身上。靠着给女儿们找到如意丈夫，她想一举把这辈子的晦气统统打消。她有两个女儿，凯蒂和多丽丝。多丽丝长得一点也不好看，鼻子太长，身材太粗。贾斯汀夫人只能寄希望于给她找上一个职业还算体面、家底还算殷实的年轻丈夫了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Kitty had been brought up with the knowledge that she was going to be a beautiful woman and she more than suspected her mother's ambition. It accorded with her own desires. She was launched upon the world and Mrs Garstin performed prodigies in getting herself invited to dances where her daughter might meet eligible men. Kitty was a success. She was amusing as well as beautiful, and very soon she had a dozen men in love with her. But none was suitable, and Kitty, charming and friendly with all, took care to commit herself with none. The drawing- room in South Kensington was filled on Sunday afternoons with amorous youth, but Mrs. Garstin observed, with a grim smile of approval, that it needed no effort on her part to keep them at a distance from Kitty. Kitty was prepared to flirt with them, and it diverted her to play one off against the other, but when they proposed to her, as none failed to do, she refused them with tact but decision.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凯蒂在自己将要成为美女的众论中长大。她看出妈妈的意图，但这也正好合了她的心思。她亭亭玉立出现在世人面前。为了使女儿得以和优雅绅士们结识，贾斯汀夫人充分发挥自己的天才，频频谋得参加舞会的机会。凯蒂成了一朵交际花。她既美丽又风趣，很快便使十多位男士坠入爱河。不过他们当中没有一个合适的，凯蒂高雅地与他们继续友好地交往，同时小心和他们保持着距离。南肯辛顿的客厅一到礼拜天的下午就挤满了前来追求爱情的年轻人。贾斯汀夫人面带冷酷的微笑，满意地观察着她房子里发生的一切，让他们别离凯蒂太近对她来说不用费吹灰之力。凯蒂和每个人打情骂俏，同时从不忘了在这群男士中挑拨离间，从中取乐。但是他们若当众求爱，正像他们每个人都做过的那样，凯蒂会圆滑地拒绝他们，却不用说出那个“不”字。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When she came out she was dazzling: her skin was still her greatest beauty, but her eyes with their long lashes were so starry and yet so melting that it gave you a catch at the heart to look into them. She had a charming gaiety and the desire to please. Mrs. Garstin bestowed upon her all the affection, a harsh, competent, calculating affection, of which she was capable; she dreamed ambitious dreams; it was not a good marriage she aimed at for her daughter, but a brilliant one.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她最终出落成的容貌着实惊艳夺目：她的皮肤依然是她最美的地方，而她长着长睫毛的眼睛熠熠有神，看了令人心旷神怡，谁都想多看一眼。她天性活泼，随处给人带来欢乐。贾斯汀夫人在她身上倾注了所有的感情，感情底下隐藏着残酷和心机，这是她所拿手的。她野心勃勃，现在她要给女儿找的不是一个好丈夫，而是一个杰出丈夫。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But Kitty was a beauty. She gave promise of being so when she was still a child, for she had large, dark eyes, liquid and vivacious, brown, curling hair in which there was a reddish tint, exquisite teeth and a lovely skin. Her features would never be very good, for her chin was too square and her nose, though not so long as Doris's, too big. Her beauty depended a good deal on her youth, and Mrs. Garstin realized that she must marry in the first flush of her maidenhood.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但凯蒂是个美人儿，她还是个孩童的时候便已是个美人胚子：大大的褐色眼睛，既活泼又水灵，一头略微泛着红色光泽的卷发，一口精致漂亮的牙齿，让人赏心悦目的皮肤。但她的长相似乎不会十分出众，因为她的脸颊过于扁平，鼻子虽然不像多丽丝那样长，也略显大了一点。她的美貌很大程度上依赖于年轻，因此贾斯汀夫人觉得有必要在她少女初成时给她找好婆家。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Her first season passed without the perfect suitor presenting himself, and the second also; but she was young and could afford to wait. Mrs. Garstin told her friends that she thought it a pity for a girl to marry till she was twenty-one. But a third year passed and then a fourth. Two or three of her old admirers proposed again, but they were still penniless; one or two boys younger than herself proposed; a retired Indian Civilian, a K. C. I. E., did the same: he was fifty-three. Kitty still danced a great deal, she went to Wimbledon and Lord's, to Ascot and Henley, she was thoroughly enjoying herself; but still no one whose position and income were satisfactory asked her to marry him. Mrs. Garstin began to grow uneasy. She noticed that Kitty was beginning to attract men of forty and over. She reminded her that she would not be any longer so pretty in a year or two and that young girls were coming out all the time. Mrs Garstin did not mince her words in the domestic circle and she warned her daughter tartly that she would miss her market.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="少女的第一年很快过去了，完美的丈夫没有出现。之后的一年也是这样。但她依然年轻，还可以等下去。贾斯汀夫人告诉朋友们，要是一个姑娘到了二十一岁才嫁出去，那真是一个悲哀。然而第三年过去了。紧接着又是第四年。两三个以前的崇拜者还在向她求婚，但谁叫他们身无分文呢。一两个比她小的小伙儿也开了口。此外还有一位退休的印度官员，现为王室顾问，他有五十三岁了。凯蒂依然频繁出现在舞会上，先是温布尔登、王宫，然后是爱斯科赛马会、亨利市。她享受着每一场舞会，但依然没有地位、收入都令人满意的男士向她求婚。贾斯汀夫人渐渐地有些按捺不住了。她察觉到凯蒂开始有意吸引四十岁以上的老男人。她提醒女儿再过一两年她就不那么漂亮了，而漂亮姑娘可是年年都有。贾斯汀夫人没有把这番话向她的小圈子里的朋友说，她严肃告诫女儿，有一天她会怀念她那群旧情人的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Kitty reached the age of twenty-five and was still unmarried. Mrs. Garstin was exasperated and she did not hesitate often to give Kitty a piece of her very unpleasant mind. She asked her how much longer she expected her father to support her. He had spent sums he could ill afford in order to give her a chance and she had not taken it. It never struck Mrs. Garstin that perhaps her own hard affability had frightened the men, sons of wealthy fathers or heirs to a title, whose visits she had too cordially encouraged. She put down Kitty's failure to stupidity. Then Doris came out. She had a long nose still, and a poor figure, and she danced badly. In her first season she became engaged to Geoffrey Dennison. He was the only son of a prosperous surgeon who had been given a baronetcy during the war. Geoffrey would inherit a title -- it is not very grand to be a medical baronet, but a title, thank God, is still a title -- and a very comfortable fortune.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凯蒂已经到了二十五岁，还是单身未嫁。贾斯汀夫人怒不可遏，经常毫不留情地给凯蒂脸色看。她问凯蒂还要她的爸爸养她多久。为了给她撑排场，几乎把他挣来的钱全都花光了，而她没有把握住一次机会。贾斯汀夫人从未想过，或许是她的过度热情吓跑了高官贵爵的子弟们，每次向他们发出邀请时，她的亲昵程度都让他们望而却步。她最终把凯蒂的失败归结为愚蠢。这时轮到多丽丝了。她的鼻子还是很长，身材也不好，跳舞跳得极差。少女时代的头一年，她和杰弗里·丹尼逊订了婚。他是一位有钱的外科医生的独生子，这位医生曾在战争期间获得了准男爵的封号，杰弗里将会继承这一封号。虽然一个中世纪的准男爵封号并非那么风光，但是——感谢上帝，封号毕竟是封号。更别说杰弗里还要继承一大笔遗产呢。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Kitty shrugged her shoulders. She thought herself as pretty as ever, prettier perhaps, for she had learnt how to dress in the last four years, and she had plenty of time. If she wanted to marry just to be married there were a dozen boys who would jump at the chance. Surely the right man would come along sooner or later. But Mrs. Garstin judged the situation more shrewdly: with anger in her heart for the beautiful daughter who had missed her chances she set her standard a little lower. She turned back to the professional class at which she had sneered in her pride and looked about for a young lawyer or a business man whose future inspired her with confidence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凯蒂只是耸了耸肩膀。她觉得她的美貌一点也没有减少，甚至比以前更漂亮了，因为在过去的四年里她学会了如何穿戴打扮，而且她还有的是时间。要是她想为了嫁人而嫁人，那马上就会跳出一打的小伙子来。那个最完美的男人出现只是早晚的事。贾斯汀夫人更具智慧地判断了形势，漂亮的女儿对机会熟视无睹让她揪心，现在她必须把标准降得低一点。她开始关注以前曾高傲地鄙视过的职业阶层，以期找到一名她认为前途光明的年轻律师或者商人。">查看中文翻译</div>
