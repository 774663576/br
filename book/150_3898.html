<div class="line_en">He came into the room: her heart was beating wildly and her hands were shaking; it was lucky that she lay on the sofa. She was holding an open book as though she had been reading. He stood for an instant on the threshold and their eyes met. Her heart sank; she felt on a sudden a cold chill pass through her limbs and she shivered. She had that feeling which you describe by saying that some one was walking over your grave. His face was deathly pale; she had seen it like that once before, when they sat together in the Park and he asked her to marry him. His dark eyes, immobile and inscrutable, seemed preternaturally large. He knew everything.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他走进了屋子。她的心脏跳得飞快，两只手直打哆嗦。幸运的是她斜躺在沙发上，手上拿着一本书，仿佛是在阅读。他在门槛那里停了一下，两人的目光接触到了一起。她心里一缩，忽然感到一股寒意掠过四肢，不禁全身抖动了一下。那种感觉就像人们常用来说自己无缘无故发抖的谚语：你躺在坟墓里，有人在你的坟上走来走去。他的脸色一片惨白。以前她只见过一次，他们坐在公园里他向她求婚的时候。他褐色的眼睛依然停滞迟钝，难以捉摸，却不自觉地比平时大。他全知道了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Her lips trembled so that she could hardly frame the words. She was terrified. She was afraid she would faint.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她的嘴唇不断地颤抖，差点连词儿也说不清了。她已经吓坏了。她担心自己撑不了多久就会昏过去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His voice sounded strange to her. It was raised on the last word in order to give his remark a casual air, but it was forced. She wondered if he saw that she was shaking in every limb. It was only by an effort that she did not scream. He dropped his eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的声音在她听来十分奇怪。他把最后一个字的声调故意向上挑，好像他只不过是随口一说，但一听就是装出来的。她忧心他有没有觉察到她的手脚正在发抖。为了不让自己尖叫出来，她已经使尽了最后一点力气。他终于垂下了目光。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was dreadful that she could not control the trembling of her lips. When was he going to speak?</div>

<div class="line_en">He left the room. She was shattered. For two or three minutes she could not stir, but at last, raising herself from the sofa with difficulty, as though she had had an illness and were still weak, she found her feet. She did not know if her legs would support her. She felt her way by means of chairs and tables to the verandah and then with one hand on the wall went to her room. She put on a tea-gown and when she went back into her boudoir (they only used the drawing-room when there was a party) he was standing at a table looking at the pictures of the Sketch. She had to force herself to enter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他走开了。她筋疲力尽，有一两分钟的功夫一动也动不了。最后她艰难地从沙发上坐起身，好像大病初愈似的，渐渐站住了脚。她也不管腿能不能撑住劲儿，用手扶着椅子、桌子，一步步把自己拖到走廊。接着一只手撑住墙，挪回自己的房间。她套上一件茶会礼服，等她回到起居室（只在开晚会的时候他们才到客厅去），他正站在桌子旁边，读着一份《简报》。她硬着头皮走了进去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They sat down and for a moment there was silence between them. Then he made a remark and because it was so commonplace it had sinister air.</div>

<div class="line_en">She looked at him now and saw that his eyes were fixed on his plate. He made another observation, equally trivial, about a tennis tournament that was about to be played, and he spoke at length. His voice as a rule was agreeable, with a variety of tone, but now he spoke on one note. It was strangely unnatural. It gave Kitty the impression that he was speaking from a long way off. And all the time his eyes were directed to his plate, or the table, or to a picture on the wall. He would not meet hers. She realized that he could not bear to look at her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她看了看他，他的眼睛盯着盘子。他又说起了另外一个话题，还是一样琐碎，是关于一场即将举行的网球赛的。他半天也没停口。若在平常他的声调应该是清新悦耳、抑扬顿挫。现在他一直用一个调子，显然极其不同寻常。凯蒂觉得他要永远说下去似的。他的眼睛很少离开他的盘子，只是偶尔看向餐桌，有时往墙上的照片瞥一眼，但从来不向凯蒂那儿瞅。她悟出他是没有跟她对视的勇气。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"If you like."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“随你所愿。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She rose and he held open the door for her. His eyes were cast down as she passed him. When they reached the sitting-room he took up the illustrated paper once more.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她站起身，他为她开了门。她从他身边走过，而他的眼睛一直低低地垂着。到了起居室，他又拿起了那份插画报纸。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Is this a new Sketch? I don't think I've seen it."</div>

<div class="line_en">It had been lying about for a fortnight and she knew that he had looked it through and through. He took it and sat down. She lay again on the sofa and took her book. As a rule in the evening, when they were alone, they played coon-can or patience. He was leaning back in an arm-chair, in a comfortable attitude, and his attention seemed absorbed by the illustration he was looking at. He did not turn the page. She tried to read, but she could not see the print before her eyes. The words were blurred. Her head began to ache violently.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那份报纸搁在那儿有两个礼拜了，她知道他已经读过不止一遍。他拿着报纸坐了下来。她靠到沙发上，捧起了她的书。倘在以前，晚上要是没有外人，他们会一起打库恩坎牌或者佩兴斯牌。他仰躺在沙发椅里，怡然自得地读着报纸，似乎被上面的插画深深吸引住了，但始终没有翻到第二页。她也想读几页书，然而眼前的字却模模糊糊，叫她分辨不清。她头疼得要命。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They sat in silence for an hour. She gave up the pretence of reading, and letting her novel fall on her lap, gazed into space. She was afraid to make the smallest gesture or the smallest sound. He sat quite still, in that same easy attitude, and stared with those wide, immobile eyes of his at the picture. His stillness was strangely menacing. It gave Kitty the feeling of a wild beast prepared to spring.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们不声不响地坐了一个小时。她不再装着读了，把小说撂到腿上，凝视着书页上空白的地方。这个时候她不想弄出一点响动。他还是纹丝不动，摆着舒舒服服的姿势，瞪大眼睛盯住插画看个没完。然而，貌似平静中似乎潜藏着危险。凯蒂觉得他就像一只蓄势待发的猛兽。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When suddenly he stood up she started. She clenched her hands and she felt herself grow pale. Now!</div>

<div class="line_en">"I have some work to do," he said in that quiet, toneless voice, his eyes averted. "If you don't mind I'll go into my study. I daresay you'll have gone to bed by the time I've finished."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我有些工作要做。”他用平静直板的声调说道，眼睛则回避着她。“如果你不介意，我这就回我的书房。等我做完你大概已经上床了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
