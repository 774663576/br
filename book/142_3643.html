<div class="line_en">The story was quickly told. Eight years ago Johnny Fontane had made an extraordinary success singing with a popular dance band. He had become a top radio attraction. Unfortunately the band leader, a well-known show business personality named Les Halley, had signed Johnny to a five-year personal services contract. It was a common show business practice. Les Halley could now loan Johnny out and pocket most of the money.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="故事讲的很快。八年前，约翰尼·方亭在一个跳舞的乐队里面唱歌，做得十分的出色。那时候他成了电台的风云人物。不幸地是，乐队的头，一个叫做赖斯·哈雷的挺出名的现场秀商人和约翰尼签了五年的协议。那只是一个十分普通的现场秀演出。方亭可以挣到很多的钱，但是大部分都被赖斯·哈雷装进了腰包。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The next day Don Corleone went to see the band leader personally. He brought with him his two best friends, Genco Abbandando, who was his Consigliere, and Luca Brasi. With no other witnesses Don Corleone persuaded Les Halley to sign a document giving up all rights to all services from Johnny Fontane upon payment of a certified check to the amount of ten thousand dollars. Don Corleone did this by putting a pistol to the forehead of the band leader and assuring him with the utmost seriousness that either his signature or his brains would rest on that document in exactly one minute. Les Halley signed. Don Corleone pocketed his pistol and handed over the certified check.</div>

<div class="line_en">Don Corleone entered the negotiations personally. He offered Les Halley twenty thousand dollars to release Johnny Fontane from the personal services contract. Halley offered to take only fifty percent of Johnny's earnings. Don Corleone was amused. He dropped his offer from twenty thousand dollars to ten thousand dollars. The band leader, obviously not a man of the world outside his beloved show business, completely missed the significance of this lower offer. He refused.</div>

<div class="line_en">Michael sighed. "I guess that's the way it sounds, but let me tell you this. You know those Arctic explorers who leave caches of food scattered on the route to the North Pole? Just in case they may need them someday? That's my father's favors. Someday he'll be at each one of those people's houses and they had better come across."</div>

<div class="line_en">The rest was history. Johnny Fontane went on to become the greatest singing sensation in the country. He made Hollywood musicals that earned a fortune for his studio. His records made millions of dollars. Then he divorced his childhood-sweetheart wife and left his two children, to marry the most glamorous blond star in motion pictures. He soon learned that she was a "whore." He drank, he gambled, he chased other women. He lost his singing voice. His records stopped selling. The studio did not renew his contract. And so now he had come back to his Godfather.</div>

Specially baked by Nazorine, it was cleverly decorated with shells of cream so dizzyingly delicious that the bride greedily plucked them from the corpse of the cake before she whizzed away on her honeymoon with her blond groom.

<div class="line_en">The family of Genco Abbandando, wife and three daughters dressed in black, clustered like a flock of plump crows on the white tile floor of the hospital corridor. When they saw Don Corleone come out of the elevator, they seemed to flutter up off the white tiles in an instinctive surge toward him for protection. The mother was regally stout in black, the daughters fat and plain. Mrs. Abbandando pecked at Don Corleone's cheek, sobbing, wailing, "Oh, what a saint you are, to come here on your daughter's wedding day."</div>

<div class="line_en">Don Corleone brushed these thanks aside. "Don't I owe respect to such a friend, a friend who has been my right arm for twenty, years?" He had understood immediately that the soon-to-be widow did not comprehend that her husband would die this night. Genco Abbandando had been in this hospital for nearly a year dying of his cancer and the wife had come to consider his fatal illness almost an ordinary part of life. Tonight was just another crisis. She babbled on. "Go in and see my poor husband," she said, "he asks for you. Poor man, he wanted to come to the wedding to show his respect but the doctor would not permit it. Then he said you would come to see him on this great day but I did not believe it possible. Ah, men understand friendship more than we women. Go inside, you will make him happy."</div>

The others in the room were astonished to see tears running down Don Corleone's face as he shook his head. The quavering voice grew louder, filling the room. With a tortured, superhuman effort, Abbandando lifted his head off his pillow, eyes unseeing, and pointed a skeletal forefinger at the Don. "Godfather, Godfather," he called out blindly, "save me from death, I beg of you. My flesh is burning off my bones and I can feel the worms eating away my brain.

The Consigliere was always a full-blooded Sicilian, and the fact that Hagen had been brought up as a member of the Don's family made no difference to that tradition. It was a question of blood. Only a Sicilian born to the ways of ormerta, the law of silence, could be trusted in the key post of Consigliere. Between the head of the family, Don Corleone, who dictated policy, and the operating level of men who actually carried out the orders of the Don, there were three layers, or buffers. In that way nothing could be traced to the top. Unless the Consigliere turned traitor. That Sunday morning Don Corleone gave explicit instructions on what should be done to the two young men who had beaten the daughter of Amerigo Bonasera. But he had given those orders in private to Tom Hagen. Later in the day Hagen had, also in private without witnesses, instructed Clemenza. In turn Clemenza had told Paulie Gatto to execute the commission. Paulie Gatto would now muster the necessary manpower and execute the orders. Paulie Gatto and his men would not know why this particular task was being carried out or who had ordered it originally.

He would know everything the Don knew or nearly everything, all the cells of power. He was the one man in the world who could bring the Don crashing down to destruction. But no Consigliere had ever betrayed a Don, not in the memory of any of the powerful Sicilian families who had established themselves in America. There was no future in it.

He had entertained J. Edgar Hoover in his Hollywood home. But none of this was as impressive as it sounded. They were all official relationships.

But for years Hagen had had nightmares, dreaming he had grown to manhood blind, tapping a white cane, his blind children behind him tap-tapping with their little white canes as they begged in the streets. Some mornings when he woke the face of Don Corleone was imprinted on his brain in that first conscious moment and he would feel safe.</div>

<div class="line_en">But the Don had insisted that he put in three years of general law practice in addition to his duties for the family business. This experience had proved invaluable later on, and also removed any doubts in Hagen's mind about working for Don Corleone. He had then spent two years of training in the offices of a top firm of criminal lawyers in which the Don had some influence. It was apparent to everyone that he had a flair for this branch of the law. He did well and when he went into the full-time service of the family business, Don Corleone had not been able to reproach him once in the six years that followed.</div>

<div class="line_en">When he had been made the acting Consigliere, the other powerful Sicilian families referred contemptuously to the Corleone family as the "Irish gang." This had amused Hagen.

<div class="line_en">The day before, Hagen had called the most powerful man in the movie labor unions, a man named Billy Goff. Acting on instructions from Don Corleone, Hagen had told Goff to arrange an appointment on the next day for Hagen to call on Jack Woltz, that he should hint to Woltz that if Hagen was not made happy by the results of the interview, there could be a labor strike at the movie studio. An hour later Hagen received a call from Goff. The appointment would be at ten A. M. Woltz had gotten the message about the possible labor strike but hadn't seemed too impressed, Goff said. He added, "If it really comes down to that, I gotta talk to the Don myself."</div>

<div class="line_en">It was still dark when the plane landed in Los Angeles. Hagen checked into his hotel, showered and shaved, and watched dawn come over the city.

<div class="line_en">His analysis proved correct. Woltz kept him waiting for a half hour past the appointed time. Hagen didn't mind. The reception room was very plush, very comfortable, and on a plum-colored couch opposite him sat the most beautiful child Hagen had ever seen. She was no more than eleven or twelve, dressed in a very expensive but simple way as a grown woman. She had incredibly golden hair, huge deep sea-blue eyes and a fresh raspberry-red mouth. She was guarded by a woman obviously her mother, who tried to stare Hagen down with a cold arrogance that made him want to punch her in the face. The angel child and the dragon mother, Hagen thought, returning the mother's cold stare.</div>

<div class="line_en">But the ten A. M. appointment was a bad sign. It meant that he would be first on the appointment list, that he would not be invited to lunch. It meant that Woltz held him in small worth. Goff had not been threatening enough, probably because Woltz had him on his graft payroll. And sometimes the Don's success in keeping himself out of the limelight worked to the disadvantage of the family business, in that his name did not mean anything to outside circles.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是上午十点的会谈时间不是个好兆头。这意味着，他是会见名单的第一个，他也不会被邀请共进午餐。这也意味着沃尔兹根本就没把他当回事。高夫没有给他足够的威胁，或许是因为他一直都受着沃尔兹的恩惠。而且有时候，老爷子在保持自己远离镁光灯对自己的家族产业也有不好的地方，因为他的名字对局外人来说什么都不是。">查看中文翻译</div>

Hagen was impressed by the beauty of the offices and the people working in them. He smiled.

<div class="line_en">Jack Woltz was a tall, powerfully built man with a heavy paunch almost concealed by his perfectly tailored suit. Hagen knew his history. At ten years of age Woltz had hustled empty beer kegs and pushcarts on the East Side. At twenty he helped his father sweat garment workers. At thirty he had left New York and moved West, invested in the nickelodeon and pioneered motion pictures. At forty-eight he had been the most powerful movie magnate in Hollywood, still rough-spoken, rapaciously amorous, a raging wolf ravaging helpless flocks of young starlets. At fifty he transformed himself. He took speech lessons, learned how to dress from an English valet and how to behave socially from an English butler. When his first wife died he married a world-famous and beautiful actress who didn't like acting. Now at the age of sixty he collected old master paintings, was a member of the President's Advisory Committee, and had set up a multimillion-dollar foundation in his name to promote art in motion pictures. His daughter had married an English lord, his son an Italian princess.</div>

<div class="line_en">Hagen listened patiently. He had expected better from a man of Woltz's stature. Was it possible that a man who acted this stupidly could rise to the head of a company worth hundreds of millions? That was something to think about since the Don was looking for new things to put money into, and if the top brains of this industry were so dumb, movies might be the thing. The abuse itself bothered him not at all. Hagen had learned the art of negotiation from the Don himself. "Never get angry," the Don had instructed. "Never make a threat. Reason with people." The word "reason" sounded so much better in Italian, ragione, to rejoin. The art of this was to ignore all insults, all threats; to turn the other cheek. Hagen had seen the Don sit at a negotiating table for eight hours, swallowing insults, trying to persuade a notorious and megalomaniac strong-arm man to mend his ways. At the end of the eight hours Don Corleone had thrown up his hands in a helpless gesture and said to the other men at the table, "But no one can reason with this fellow," and had stalked out of the meeting room. The strong-arm man had turned white with fear. Emissaries were sent to bring the Don back into the room. An agreement was reached but two months later the strong-arm was shot to death in his favorite barbershop.</div>

Let me just say that I am prepared to meet any condition you name to get Johnny Fontane that movie. I think I've already offered a great deal for such a small favor. A favor that I understand it would be in your interest to grant. Johnny tells me that you admit he would be perfect for that part.

<div class="line_en">"I have one of those dignified corporate practices," Hagen said dryly. "I just handle this one account." He rose. "I won't take up any more of your time." He held out his hand, Woltz shook it. Hagen took a few steps toward the door and turned to face Woltz again. "I understand you have to deal with a lot of people who try to seem more important than they are. In my case the reverse is true. Why don't you check me out with our mutual friend? If you reconsider, call me at my hotel." He paused. "This may be sacrilege to you, but my client can do things for you that even Mr. Hoover might find out of his range." He saw the movie producer's eyes narrowing. Woltz was finally getting the message. "By the way, I admire your pictures very much," Hagen said in the most fawning voice he could manage. "I hope you can keep up the good work. Our country needs it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我曾经有过一段时间认真的执业律师经历，”黑根冷冰冰地说。“我只处理这一件事。”他占了起来。“我不占用你的时间了。”他伸出自己的手，沃尔兹和他握了握手。黑根向门口走了几步，又转过身面对沃尔兹。“我知道你要和很多使自己看起来十分重要的人打交道。但是在我的这件事里面情况恰恰相反。你为什么不和我们共同的朋友好好的查查我的底细？如果你肯重新考虑，打我旅馆的电话。”他停顿了一下。“这可能使你觉得冒犯了，但是我的老板可以为你做到胡佛先生做不到的事情。”他看到这个电影制作人的眼睛变得窄了。沃尔兹终于理解了是怎么一回事了。“顺便说一句，我非常喜欢你的电影，”黑根以自己力所能及的讨好的语气说。“我希望你能够再出好电影。我们的国家需要它。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Late that afternoon Hagen received a call from the producer's secretary that a car would pick him up within the hour to take him out to Mr. Woltz's country home for dinner. She told him it would be about a three-hour drive but that the car was equipped with a bar and some hors d'oeuvres. Hagen knew that Woltz made the trip in his private plane and wondered why he hadn't been invited to make the trip by air. The secretary's voice was adding politely, "Mr. Woltz suggested you bring an overnight bag and he'll get you to the airport in the morning."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天下午比较晚的时候，黑根从那个电影制片人的秘书那里接到一个电话，说一个小时之内会有一辆车会到他的旅馆把他接到沃尔兹先生的乡村别墅那里共进晚餐。她告诉黑根，车子要开三个小时，但是车上有一个小酒吧和一些开胃小菜。黑根知道自己受到了沃尔兹的私人邀请，但是不明白为什么请他做飞机过去。那个秘书还彬彬有礼地说，“沃尔兹先生建议你带着过夜的小包，明天早晨他会送你到机场。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'll do that," Hagen said. That was another thing to wonder about. How did Woltz know he was taking the morning plane back to New York? He thought about it for a mo­ment. The most likely explanation was that Woltz had set private detectives on his trail to get all possible information. Then Woltz certainly knew he represented the Don, which meant that he knew something about the Don, which in turn meant that he was now ready to take the whole matter seriously. Something might be done after all, Hagen thought. And maybe Woltz was smarter than he had appeared this morning.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好的，”黑根说。那是另一件值得思考的事情。沃尔兹怎么知道他明天早晨要坐飞机回纽约？他想了一会儿。最好的解释就是，他派人跟踪了黑根，并且把他的底细查的一清二楚了。那也就意味着他知道了他是替老爷子办事的，意味着他对老爷子有些了解了，这就说明他要好好的认真对待整件事情了。黑根想，或者这件事就可以做成了。并且，或者沃尔兹比他今天造成表现的要聪明一些。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Woltz greeted Hagen on a glass-paneled air-conditioned porch. The producer was informally dressed in blue silk shirt open at the neck, mustard-colored slacks, soft leather sandals. Framed in all this color and rich fabric his seamed, tough face was startling. He handed Hagen an outsized martini glass and took one for himself from the prepared tray. He seemed more friendly than he had been earlier in the day. He put his arm over Hagen's shoulder and said, "We have a little time before dinner, let's go look at my horses."

<div class="line_en">The horse inside the stall was, even to Hagen's inexperienced eyes, a beautiful animal. Khartoum's skin was jet black except for a diamond-shaped white patch on his huge forehead. The great brown eyes glinted like golden apples, the black skin over the taut body was silk. Woltz said with childish pride, "The greatest racehorse in the world. I bought him in England last year for six hundred grand. I bet even the Russian Czars never paid that much for a single horse. But I'm not going to race him, I'm going to put him to stud. I'm going to build the greatest racing stable this country has ever known." He stroked the horse's mane and called out softly, "Khartoum, Khartoum." There was real love in his voice and the animal responded. Woltz said to Hagen, "I'm a good horseman, you know, and the first time I ever rode I was fifty years old." He laughed. "Maybe one of my grandmothers in Russia got raped by a Cossack and I got his blood." He tickled Khartoum's belly and said with sincere admiration, "Look at that cock on him. I should have such a cock."</div>

<div class="line_en">That solved one puzzle for Hagen. Why Woltz was putting in so much time on him when he had already decided not to give Johnny the part. And that could not be changed at this meeting. Woltz felt secure; he was not afraid of the power of Don Corleone. And certainly Woltz with his national political connections, his acquaintanceship with the FBI chief, his huge personal fortune and his absolute power in the film industry, could not feel threatened by Don Corleone. To any intelligent man, even to Hagen, it seemed that Woltz had correctly assessed his position. He was impregnable to the Don if he was willing to take the losses the labor struggle would cost. There was only one thing wrong with the whole equation. Don Corleone had promised his godson he would get the part and Don Corleone had never, to Hagen's knowledge, broken his word in such matters.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这解释了黑跟单的一个疑惑。既然沃尔兹已经决定要拒绝给约翰尼那个职位，并且这个决定也没有办法在这次会见改变，为什么还要在他身上花费那么多的时间呢？沃尔兹觉得很安全，他不怕唐·科里昂的势力。当然，凭借着他和国家级政界的关系，他和FBI头头的关系，他的巨额私人财产和他在电影界的绝对地位根本没有必要感觉被唐·科里昂的威胁。对任何有点头脑的人来说，甚至在黑根看来，沃尔兹都十分正确地评价了自己的地位。他如果甘愿承受罢工带来的损失的话，唐·科里昂是没有办法拿他怎么样的。整件事里面只有一件事情不对。唐·科里昂已经对自己的教子做出了承诺，而且就黑根所知，他从来都没有让自己的教子失望过。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Hagen thought, you sneaky bastard, then why the hell did you bring me all the way out here? The producer had some­thing on his mind. Hagen said coldly, "I don't think you understand the situation. Mr. Corleone is Johnny Fontane's godfather. That is a very close, a very sacred religious relationship." Woltz bowed his head in respect at this reference to religion. Hagen went on. "Italians have a little joke, that the world is so hard a man must have two fathers to look after him, and that's why they have godfathers. Since Johnny's father died, Mr. Corleone feels his responsibility even more deeply. As for trying you again, Mr. Corleone is much too sensitive. He never asks a second favor where he has been refused the first."</div>

It would make him a great star. But he never will be because I hate that pinko punk and I'm going to run him out of the movies. And I'll tell you why. He ruined one of my most valuable protegees. For five years I had this girl under training, singing, dancing, acting lessons, I spent hundreds of thousands of dollars. I was going to make her a star. I'll be even more frank, just to show you that I'm not a hard-hearted man, that it wasn't all dollars and cents. That girl was beautiful and she was the greatest piece of ass I've ever had and I've had them all over the world. She could suck you out like a water pump.

Her sea-blue eyes were filmed over and when she walked down the steps toward the open car her long legs tottered like a crippled foal's.

<div class="line_en">Now both of them turned their attention to Kevin Moonan, who was trying to shout. The man holding him from behind did so easily with one huge muscled arm. The other hand he put around Moonan's throat to cut off any sound.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在他们把注意力转向了凯文·穆南，他正想要喊人叫救命。抓着他的那个人以他那健壮的胳膊扭住他，做的十分轻松。另一只手围住穆南的喉咙，卡的他发不出任何声音。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The two young men turned on him with delight. Paulie Gatto looked like a perfect outlet for their humiliation. Ferret-faced, short, slightly built and a wise guy in the bargain. They pounced on him eagerly and immediately found their arms pinned by two men grabbing them from behind. At the same moment Paulie Gatto had slipped onto his right hand a specially made set of brass knuckles studded with one-sixteenth-inch iron spikes. His timing was good, he worked out in the gym three times a week. He smashed the punk named Wagner right on the nose. The man holding Wagner lifted him up off the ground and Paulie swung his arm, uppercutting into the perfectly positioned groin. Wagner went limp and the big man dropped him. This had taken no more than six seconds.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那两个人高兴地转过来望着他。保利·盖托看起来似乎是他们的耻辱的绝好的宣泄口。雪貂似的脸，矮小但是还算结实，除此之外还是一个非常通情达理的人。他们往他这边扑过来，但是发现他们的双收被人从后面给别住了。就在这个时候，保利·盖托迅速在右手带上一个指节铜套，上面布满了十六分之一长的铁钉。他的时间拿捏的正好，而且每周去三次健身房。他一拳打在瓦格纳的鼻子上。那两个人把他举起来，保利甩了一下胳膊，一个上勾拳打在他的腹股沟处。瓦格纳立马晕了过去，他们就把他给丢在地上了。这总共都没有用六秒钟的时间。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Paulie Gatto jumped into the car and started the motor. The two big men were beating Moonan to jelly. They did so with frightening deliberation, as if they had all the time in the world. They did not throw punches in flurries but in timed, slow-motion sequences that carried the full weight of their massive bodies. Each blow landed with a splat of flesh splitting open. Gatto got a glimpse of Moonan's face. It was unrecognizable. The two men left Moonan lying on the sidewalk and turned their attention to Wagner. Wagner was trying to get to his feet and he started to scream for help. Someone came out of the bar and the two men had to work faster now. They clubbed Wagner to his knees. One of the men took his arm and twisted it, then kicked him in the spine. There was a cracking sound and Wagner's scream of agony brought windows open all along the street. The two men worked very quickly. One of them held Wagner up by using his two hands around Wagner's head like a vise. The other man smashed his huge fist into the fixed target. There were more people coming out of the bar but none tried to interfere. Paulie Gatto yelled, "Come on, enough." The two big men jumped into the car and Paulie gunned it away, Somebody would describe the car and read the license plates but it didn't matter. It was a stolen California plate and there were one hundred thousand black Chevy sedans in New York City.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="保利·盖托跳进车里，发动引擎。那两个彪形大汉正在狂打穆南的肚子。他们的动作是如此的从容，仿佛他们时间有的是。他们并没有疾风暴雨般地出拳，相反他们用的是慢拳，这样他们全部的重量都可以打在他们身上。每一拳都会打得他皮开肉绽。盖托看了一下穆南的脸，那已经辨认不出来了。那两个人把穆南丢在人行道上，把注意力转向了瓦格纳。瓦格纳试图站起来，并且开始喊救命了。有人从酒吧里面出来，这两个人必须把工作快点做完了。他们把瓦格纳驾着跪在地上，其中一个人抓住他的胳膊并且用力扭住，然后在他的脊柱上面踢了一脚，他们听到一声骨头断裂的声音。瓦格纳痛苦地喊了出来，这声音使得街上的窗子全都打开了。这两个人干得很快。其中一个人抓住瓦格纳的脖子把他拎起来，就像是那一个花瓶那样，另一个就一把打在这个活靶子上面。酒吧里面出来的人更多了，但是没有人过来干预。保利·盖托喊道，“来吧，够了。”那两个人跳进车里，保利一溜烟把它开走了。有人可能会记住这辆车的样子，并且可能记住了号码。没有关系。车牌是一个偷的加州的牌子，纽约的黑色雪弗莱轿车有成千上万辆，让他们找去吧。">查看中文翻译</div>
