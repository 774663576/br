<div class="line_en">Two months later Gabriel went to the great fair at Casterbridge, hoping to find a job as farm manager. But when he realized by late afternoon that none of the farmers at Casterbridge wanted a farm manager, or even a shepherd, he decided to try his luck at another fair the next day. It was fifteen miles further away, in a village the other side of Weatherbury. The name Weatherbury reminded him of Bathsheba, and he wondered if she still lived there. He set out on foot as it was getting dark, and had already walked three or four miles when he saw a cart, half-full of hay, by the side of the road. "That's a comfortable place to sleep," he thought, and he was so tired after his long, disappointing day at the fair that when he climbed into the cart, he fell asleep immediately.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh, if she's vain, Billy Smallbury, I'll never be able to look at her! I'm such a shy man, as you know!" said the other. "A single woman, and vain! And does she pay her farm workers well?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Gabriel thought they could be talking about Bathsheba, except that the woman they were discussing seemed to be the mistress of a farm. As the cart was now quite near Weatherbury, Gabriel jumped out, unseen by the two men. He climbed a gate into a field, intending to sleep for the rest of the night under a hayrick, but then he noticed an unusual light in the darkness, about half a mile away. Something was on fire.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="盖伯瑞尔想他们谈论的可能是芭丝谢芭，只是他们谈论的女人好像是一个农场的女主人。马车快到威瑟伯里时，盖伯瑞尔跳下了车，那两个人也未发现。他翻越过一个大门进了一块地里，打算在一个干草垛下过夜，就在这时，他注意到大约一英里远的地方黑暗中有不寻常的火光。有东西着火了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He hurried across the fields towards the fire. Soon, in the rich orange light of the flames, he could see a hayrick burning fiercely. It was too late to save the rick, so for a few minutes he stood and stared at the flames. But when the smoke cleared for a moment, he was horrified to see, very close to the burning rick, a whole row of wheat-ricks. These probably contained most of the wheat produced on the farm that year, and could catch fire at any moment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他穿过田地向着火的地方跑去。接着，他看到熊熊的火光中，干草垛肆虐地燃烧着。现在已来不及救干草垛了，有好几分钟他就站在那儿盯着火焰。可是当烟散开一点后，他吃惊地看到有一排麦垛就紧挨着燃烧着的干草垛。这个农场这一年产的大部分麦子可能都在这儿，这些麦垛随时有着火的可能。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As he rushed towards the wheat-rick that was most in danger, he saw he was not alone. A crowd of farm workers had seen the fire and run into the field to help save the wheat, but they were so confused they did not know what to do. Gabriel took control and gave orders.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当他向最危急的一个麦垛冲去时，他看到在场的并不只是他一人。一群农场工人看到着了火，跑到地里来帮着抢救麦子。只是他们太混乱了，不知道该做什么。盖伯瑞尔控制住局面，开始发号施令。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Get a large cloth!" he shouted. "Put it over the wheat-rick, so the wind can't blow the flames from the hayrick on to it! Now, you, stand here with a bucket of water and keep the cloth wet!" The men hurried to obey him. The flames, prevented from burning the bottom and sides of the wheat-rick, began to attack its roof.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“找一块大布来！”他喊道。“用布把麦垛裹住，这样干草垛上的火苗就不会被吹到麦垛上！你，拿一桶水站在这儿，让布保持湿润！”人们立刻听从他的指挥。烧不着麦垛底部和边部的火焰开始袭击顶部。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Get me a ladder!" cried Gabriel. "And a branch, and some water!" He climbed up the wheat-rick and sat on the top, beating down the flames with the branch. Billy Smallbury, one of the men who had been in the cart, climbed up with a bucket of water, to throw water on Gabriel and keep the flames off him. The smoke was at its thickest at this corner of the rick, but Gabriel never stopped his work.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“给我找一架梯子！”盖伯瑞尔大声说，‘再找一个树枝和一些水！”他爬上麦垛，坐在顶上，用树枝打灭火苗。斯摩伯里，马车上两人中的一个，提着一桶水爬了上来。他把水浇在盖伯瑞尔身上以免火苗烧到他的身上。盖伯瑞尔呆的这个角上浓烟滚滚，但他却一刻也没有停歇。">查看中文翻译</div>

Although his face was black from the smoke and his clothes were burnt by the fire, he remembered to lift his hat politely, and asked, looking up at her, "Do you want a shepherd, ma'am?" She let her cloak fall back from her head in surprise. Gabriel and his cold-hearted darling, Bathsheba Everdene, stared at each other. She did not speak.
