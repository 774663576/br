<div class="line_en">It was foggy and dark outside my window, absolutely perfect. He had no reason not to be in school today. I dressed in my heavy clothes, remembering I didn't have a jacket. Further proof that my memory was real.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="窗外雾蒙蒙，阴沉沉的，实在是好极了。他今天可没有理由不来学校了。我想起来自己的夹克不在，便穿上了层层叠叠的厚衣服。这进一步证实了我的记忆是真实的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was very hard, in the morning, to argue with the part of me that was sure last night was a dream. Logic wasn't on my side, or common sense. I clung to the parts I couldn't have imagined -- like his smell. I was sure I could never have dreamed that up on my own.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="早上，我的某一部分非常肯定昨晚的一切都只是一场梦，而与之辩驳实在是件非常艰难的事。逻辑并不站在我这边，或者说，常识。我抱定了自己绝对想象不出来的那个部分——比方说他的香味。我相当确定，我永远都不可能自己梦到这种事的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When I got downstairs, Charlie was gone again -- I was running later than I'd realized. I swallowed a granola bar in three bites, chased it down with milk straight from the carton, and then hurried out the door. Hopefully the rain would hold off until I could find Jessica.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当我下楼的时候，查理也已经走了——我的动作比我意识到的还慢。我三口就咽下了一个格兰诺拉燕麦棒，直接用一盒牛奶把它送下去，然后匆忙地奔出门外。这场雨很有希望能拖延到我找到杰西卡以后才下。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was unusually foggy; the air was almost smoky with it. The mist was ice cold where it clung to the exposed skin on my face and neck. I couldn't wait to get the heat going in my truck. It was such a thick fog that I was a few feet down the driveway before I realized there was a car in it: a silver car. My heart thudded, stuttered, and then picked up again in double time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这雾大得不可思议：空气里几乎浸透了浓雾，一片模糊。雾气侵袭着我暴露在空气中的脸部和脖子的肌肤，冰冷刺骨。我迫不及待地想要钻进车里取暖。这雾太浓了，当我离车道只有几英尺远的时候，我才注意到那里有一辆银色的车。我的心砰砰直响，如小鹿乱撞，然后很快又找回了自己的节奏。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Do you want to ride with me today?" he asked, amused by my expression as he caught me by surprise yet again. There was uncertainty in his voice. He was really giving me a choice -- I was free to refuse, and part of him hoped for that. It was a vain hope.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“今天你愿意搭我的车吗？”他问道，被我的表情逗乐了。他又一次出其不意地抓到了我。他的声音里充满了不确定。他确实给了我一个选择的机会——我完全可以拒绝，而且他的一部分希望我这样做。这是一种徒劳的希望。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I didn't see where he came from, but suddenly he was there, pulling the door open for me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我没看见他是从哪里冒出来的，但忽然间他就在那里了，为我拉开车门。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I brought the jacket for you. I didn't want you to get sick or something." His voice was guarded. I noticed that he wore no jacket himself, just a light gray knit V-neck shirt with long sleeves. Again, the fabric clung to his perfectly muscled chest. It was a colossal tribute to his face that it kept my eyes away from his body.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我带了这件夹克给你，我不希望你生病或者怎么样。”他的声音警惕着。我注意到他自己并没有穿着夹克，只穿了一件浅灰色的V领长袖恤衫。和上次一样，布料紧紧地贴着他完美的，肌肉结实的胸膛。他的脸为我能把视线从他身体上移开作出了巨大贡献。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes, thank you," I said, trying to keep my voice calm. As I stepped into the warm car, I noticed his tan jacket was slung over the headrest of the passenger seat. The door closed behind me, and, sooner than should be possible, he was sitting next to me, starting the car.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，谢谢。”我说道，试图让自己的声音保持镇静。当我钻进温暖的车里时，我注意到他那件棕褐色的夹克正搭在乘客座的靠背上。我身后的门被关上了，然后，在短得几乎不可能的时间里，他坐到了我旁边，发动了车子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm not quite that delicate," I said, but I pulled the jacket onto my lap, pushing my arms through the too-long sleeves, curious to see if the scent could possibly be as good as I remembered. It was better.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我没那么柔弱。”我说道，但还是把那件夹克拉到了膝上，把胳膊伸进对我来说太长的袖子里，好奇地想要知道那股香味是不是真的和我记忆中的一样美好。有过之而无不及。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No, that's the problem. You take everything so coolly -- it's unnatural. It makes me wonder what you're really thinking."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没有。这才是问题所在。你对待每件事都是那么冷淡——这太不寻常了。这让我很想知道你究竟在想些什么。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="我皱起眉：“我的反应有那么糟吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Not as much as your reactions do." He looked like he was joking, but I couldn't be sure.</div>

<div class="line_en">"You edit," he accused.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Enough to drive me insane."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“足够让我发疯了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We drove through the fog-shrouded streets, always too fast, feeling awkward. I was, at least. Last night all the walls were down… almost all. I didn't know if we were still being as candid today. It left me tongue-tied. I waited for him to speak.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们开着车穿过覆满浓雾的街道，但总是开得太快，至少，让我感到很不自在。昨天晚上，所有的隔阂都消失了…几乎是全部。我不知道今天我们还能不能这样坦诚相待。这个想法让我舌头打结。我等着他先开口。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He didn't respond, and I wondered if I had ruined the mood. His face was unreadable as we drove into the school parking lot. Something occurred to me belatedly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他没有回答。我想知道我是不是把气氛给毁了。当我们开进学校停车场的时候，他的表情让人捉摸不透。我后知后觉地想起来了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他转过头来，向我坏笑着。“怎么，今天没有二十个问题了吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You don't want to hear it," I mumbled, almost whispered. As soon as the words were out, I regretted them. The pain in my voice was very faint; I could only hope he hadn't noticed it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你不会想要听到的。”我低声说道，几近耳语。但话一说出口，我就后悔了。我声音里的痛苦非常地微弱，我只能希望他没有注意到。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Um, wow," I breathed. "If she has that, why does she ride with you?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“呃，哇噢，”我喘息着说。“既然她有这辆车，为什么她还要坐你的车呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Where's the rest of your family?" I asked -- more than glad to be alone with him, but remembering that his car was usually full.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你的家人在哪里？”我问道——不仅仅是因为和他独处而快乐，更多的是因为想起来他的车通常都是满的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Like I said, it's ostentatious. We try to blend in."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“就像我说的，这样太浮夸了。我们努力保持低调。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"They took Rosalie's car." He shrugged as he parked next to a glossy red convertible with the top up. "Ostentatious, isn't it?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他们坐罗莎莉的车。”他耸耸肩，把车停到了一辆闪闪发光的，车篷敞开着的火红色敞篷车旁。“太浮夸了，不是吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Hadn't you noticed? I'm breaking all the rules now." He met me at the front of the car, staying very close to my side as we walked onto campus. I wanted to close that little distance, to reach out and touch him, but I was afraid he wouldn't like me to.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你没注意到吗？现在我把所有的规则都打破了。”他和我在车前碰头，当我们走进校园里的时候，他一直紧挨着我。我很想把这段小小的距离消灭掉，想要伸出手触碰他，但我很怕他不喜欢我这样做。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You don't succeed." I laughed and shook my head as we got out of the car. I wasn't late anymore; his lunatic driving had gotten me to school in plenty of time. "So why did Rosalie drive today if it's more conspicuous?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你没成功。”我们一起走出车外时，我大笑着摇了摇头。我不会迟到了。他疯狂的驾驶让我提前了不少时间到学校。“如果这样更引人注目的话，为什么今天罗莎莉还要开车呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Why do you have cars like that at all?" I wondered aloud. "If you're looking for privacy?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“为什么你们的车都是那样的呢？”我大声地表达了自己的疑问。“如果你们想要保持隐私的话？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"An indulgence," he admitted with an impish smile. "We all like to drive fast."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“好的，待会儿见。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Figures," I muttered under my breath.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“有道理。”我低声呢喃道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Er… hi." She shifted her wide eyes to me, trying to gather her jumbled thoughts. "I guess I'll see you in Trig." She gave me a meaningful look, and I suppressed a sigh. What on earth was I going to tell her?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“唔…嗨。”她把那双大眼睛移向我，试图找回混乱的思绪。“我猜，我们三角函数课上见。”她意味深长地看了我一眼，我抑制住了一声叹息。我到底要告诉她什么呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Hey, Jessica," I said when we were a few feet away. "Thanks for remembering." She handed me my jacket without speaking.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Hmmm." He paused to catch a stray lock of hair that was escaping the twist on my neck and wound it back into place. My heart spluttered hyperactively. "I suppose you could say yes to the first… if you don't mind -- it's easier than any other explanation."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“呃。”他停下来，抓住一缕迷路的，从我脖子上的发卷里逃离出来的头发，把它缠绕回原处。我的心过度亢奋地砰砰乱跳。“我料想，你最好对第一个问题说是…如果你不介意的话——这比任何其他解释都要容易得多。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Wait! Her hands flew up, palms toward me like she was stopping traffic. Has he kissed you?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“等等！”她飞快地伸出手，掌心冲着我，就好像她在拦截车流一样。“他吻你了吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我不知道你是怎么有勇气和他独处的。”她喘息着说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I think so, but it's hard to tell. He's always so cryptic, I threw in for his benefit, sighing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我也是这样想的。但这实在很难说。他总是含糊其辞。”为着他的缘故，我叹息着，加上了这句。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We spent the rest of the walk dissecting sentence structures and most of Spanish on a minute description of Mike's facial expressions. I wouldn't have helped draw it out for as long as I did if I wasn't worried about the subject returning to me.</div>
