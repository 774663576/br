<div class="line_en">The three young men had separated at the Place Louis XV, Morrel going via the boulevards, Château-Renaud crossing the Pont de la Révolution and Debray following the path by the river. It seemed likely that Morrel and Château-Renaud would be returning to the bosom of their families -- as they still call it in the House, in well-turned speeches, and at the theatre in the Rue de Richelieu, in well-written plays; but the same was not true of Debray. When he got to the grille at the Louvre, he took a left turn, crossing the Carrousel at the double, slipped down the Rue Saint-Roch, came out at the Rue de la Michodière and arrived finally at M. Danglars' door, just as M. de Villefort's landau, having deposited him and his wife in the Faubourg Saint-Honoré, was pulling up to let the baroness return home.</div>

<div class="line_en">Debray, as someone who knew the house, was the first to go into the courtyard and he tossed the reins to a footman, then went back to the door of the carriage to help Mme Danglars, offering her his arm so that she could get down and go indoors. As soon as the gate was closed and the baroness and Debray were in the courtyard, he asked: "What is wrong, Hermine? Why were you ill when the count told that story -- or, rather, that fairy tale?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"You are wrong, Lucien, I assure you," Mme Danglars said. "It is just as I said, together with the bad temper that you noticed and which I did not think was worth mentioning to you."</div>

<div class="line_en">"No, Hermine," Debray protested. "You won't convince me of that. On the contrary, you were in an excellent mood when you got to the count's. I admit, Monsieur Danglars was a trifle gloomy, but I know what importance you attach to his bad tempers. Someone did something to you. Tell me about it. You know that I should never allow anyone to insult you in any way."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，霭敏，”狄布雷回答，“那个你是不能使我相信的。正巧相反，你刚到伯爵家里的时候精神非常好。当然罗，邓格拉司先生有点不能令人满意，但我知道你一向并不大理会他的坏脾气。一定有人惹恼你了。告诉我吧，你知道得很清楚，我是不肯让你忍受任何冒犯的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was clear that Mme Danglars was suffering from one of those nervous irritations which women are often unable to explain even to themselves, or else, as Debray had guessed, that she had experienced some hidden disturbance which she did not want to discuss with anyone. So, as a man who was used to treating "the vapours" as a part of a woman's life, he did not press the matter, but waited for a suitable opportunity to arise, either for further questioning, or else for a confession proprio motu.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="邓格拉司夫人显然在遭受着一种女人们常常连自己都解释不出的神经刺激，不然，就如狄布雷所料到的，她那种激动是某种不愿意向任何人承认的秘密。他熟知反复无常原是女性生活的要素之一，当时也不再追问，却等待一个更适当的机会，或是再问她，或是接受她自动的解释。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">No doubt the baroness thought that this unexpected visit signified something, for example a desire to make up for the bitter words which the baron had uttered during the day, so she took on a haughty air and turned towards Lucien, without answering her husband.

<div class="line_en">Debray had been slightly uneasy at this visit to begin with, but, seeing the baroness's imperturbability, he recovered his calm and stretched out his hand towards a book, marked in the centre with a mother-of-pearl paperknife inlaid with gold.</div>

<div class="line_en">Debray was astonished, though Danglars' voice was perfectly steady and polite; but behind the calm good manners he detected a certain unaccustomed impulse to do something, apart from bowing to the wishes of his wife. The baroness was equally surprised and showed her astonishment with a look that would no doubt have given her husband pause for reflection, if he had not been attentively searching the closing prices in a newspaper. The result was that her arrogant look failed to reach its target and so was completely wasted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="狄布雷呆住了——并不是因为邓格拉司的语气里有什么可惊之处，他的口吻实在十分平静温文，但在那种平静和那种温文之中，却显示出某种不寻常的坚决，象是表示今天晚上一定要违反一下他妻子的心意似的。男爵夫人也很惊奇，并且用眼光来表示她这种惊奇，这种眼光本来一定可以在她丈夫身上产生一些效力，但邓格拉司却故意全神贯注地在看报，正在晚报上寻找公债的收盘价格，所以这次射到他身上的凶猛的目光是完全白费了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This time the assault was so direct and well aimed that Lucien and the baroness were stunned by it. They exchanged a look as if each was trying to find assistance against this attack. But the irresistible power of the master of the house triumphed and the husband was left victorious.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这一次，那个打击是瞄准得这样准确，而且是正面的当头一棍，以致吕西安和男爵夫人踉跄了一下。他们互相以眼光询问对方，象是要寻觅助力来反抗这个进攻，但他们的对手究竟是一家之主，他那种无可抗拒的意志占着上风，那做丈夫的胜利了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Don't, please, think that I am driving you away, my dear Debray," Danglars went on. "No, not in the slightest.

<div class="line_cn" title="“别以为我在赶您走，我亲爱的狄布雷，”邓格拉司继续说，“噢，不！决不是的！一件意外的事情使我不得不要求我的内人和我略微谈一谈，我极少作这样的要求，我相信您一定不会以为我有什么恶意。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When Lucien had gone, Danglars sat down in his place on the sofa, closed the book and, adopting a thoroughly pretentious pose, continued to stroke the dog. However, the animal did not have the same sympathy for him as for Debray and tried to bite him, so he grasped it by the nape of the neck and tossed it across the room on to a chaise-longue. The spaniel yelped on finding itself in mid-air, but on reaching its destination buried itself in a cushion and, stupefied by this unaccustomed treatment, remained silent and motionless.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吕西安走后，邓格拉司在沙发上坐下来，合拢那本打开的书，装出一种气愤愤的样子，开始玩弄那条哈叭狗；但那头畜生因为对他并不如对狄布雷那么欢喜，并且想咬他，邓格拉司就抓住它的颈子皮把它抛到靠对面墙壁的一张睡椅上。那畜生在转移的途中嗥叫了一声，但一到它指定的目的地以后，它就蜷缩到椅垫后面，静静地一动都不动，被这种不寻常的待遇吓呆了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Debray stammered a few words, bowed and left the room, knocking against the corners, like Nathan in Athalie.

My clerks are honest fellows who earn a fortune for me and are paid at a rate considerably below what they are worth, if that is judged according to the profits they bring; so I am not going to lose my temper with them.

<div class="line_en">"I don't say that I knew or that I didn't; I am just telling you this: consider how I have behaved in the four years since we have ceased to live as man and wife, and you will see that my conduct has always been consistent. Some time before the breach between us, you wanted to study music with that famous baritone who was such a success at the Théâtre Italien, while I wanted to study dancing with that dancer who had been so warmly received when she appeared in London. It cost me, for you and for me, some hundred thousand francs. I did not complain, because one must try to preserve the peace in one's home. A hundred thousand francs for the man and the woman to perfect their dancing and their music is not excessive. Then you soon became bored with singing, and you got the idea that you would like to study diplomacy with one of the minister's secretaries. I let you. You see, it doesn't matter to me, as long as you are paying for your lessons out of your own pocket. But I now see that you are dipping into mine and that your further education might cost me as much as seven hundred thousand francs a month. Whoa, Madame! It can't go on like this. Either the diplomat will have to start giving his… lessons for nothing, and I shall put up with him, or he will not be allowed to set foot again in my house. Do you understand?"</div>

"What mad creatures they are, these women who think themselves geniuses because they have managed to carry on one or two affairs without everyone in Paris knowing about them! But just consider: even if you had disguised your irregularities from your husband himself -- and that is the most elementary skill in the business, because most of the time husbands don't want to see what is going on -- you would still only be a pale copy of what most of your society friends are doing. With me it is different: I saw and I have always seen. In roughly the past sixteen years you may have hidden a thought from me, but never a step, an action or a sin. While you were flattering yourself as to your skill and firmly believed that you were deceiving me, what happened? The truth was that, thanks to my turning a blind eye, there has not been one of your friends, from Monsieur de Villefort to Monsieur Debray, who has not been afraid of me. There is not one who has not treated me as the master of the house, which is my only claim on you. In short, not one would have dared say to you the things about myself that I am telling you today.

I am brutal: not only do I know that, I am proud of it: it is one secret of my success in business. Why, instead of killing the other man, did he kill himself? Because he had no fortune to save. But I do, and I have an obligation to my money. My associate, Monsieur Debray, has lost me seven hundred thousand francs. Let him pay for his share of the loss and we shall continue to do business. Otherwise, let him go bankrupt for his hundred and seventy-five thousand livres and do what all bankrupts do, which is to disappear.
