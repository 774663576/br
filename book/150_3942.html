<div class="line_en">But she was awakened by a loud knocking. At first, since it was interwoven with the dream from which she was aroused, she could not attach the sound to reality. The knocking went on and she was conscious that it must be at the gateway of the compound. It was quite dark. She had a watch with phosphorized hands and saw that it was half past two. It must be Walter coming back -- how late he was -- and he could not awake the boy. The knocking went on, louder and louder, and in the silence of the night it was really not a little alarming. The knocking stopped and she heard the withdrawing of the heavy bolt. Walter had never come back so late. Poor thing, he must be tired out! She hoped he would have the sense to go straight to bed instead of working as usual in that laboratory of his.</div>

<div class="line_en">There was a sound of voices, and people came into the compound. That was strange, for Walter coming home late, in order not to disturb her, took pains to be quiet. Two or three persons ran swiftly up the wooden steps and came into the room next door. Kitty was a little frightened. At the back of her mind was always the fear of an anti-foreign riot. Had something happened? Her heart began to beat quickly. But before she had time to put her vague apprehension into shape someone walked across the room and knocked at her door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凯蒂听见了好几个人的说话声，然后一群人一哄而入。这就奇怪了，以前瓦尔特要是晚回来，都是恐怕打搅了她，尽量轻手轻脚，不弄出一点声响。凯蒂听到两三个人快步地跑上了木头台阶，进了她隔壁的屋子里。凯蒂心里害怕起来，她一直对老百姓的排外暴乱心怀忧惧。会不会出了什么事？她的心脏加速了跳动。但是她还没来得及确认暴乱的可能性，有个人就从屋子里走了出来，到她的门外敲了敲门。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She rose and put on a dressing-gown. She unlocked the door and opened it. Her glance took in Waddington in a pair of Chinese trousers and a pongee coat, the house-boy holding a hurricane lamp, and a little further back three Chinese soldiers in khaki. She started as she saw the consternation on Waddington's face; his head was tousled as though he had just jumped out of bed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她站起身，穿上了一件晨衣，然后把锁解下，拉开了门。韦丁顿站在门口，他穿了一条中国式的长裤，上身套了一件茧绸的褂子。童仆站在他的后面，手里提着一盏马灯。再后面是三个穿着卡其布军衣的中国兵士。看到韦丁顿脸上惶恐的表情，她吓了一跳。他的头发乱作一团，好像是刚从床上爬起来似的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The sight of the soldiers suggested to her at once that there had been an outbreak and they were come to protect her.</div>

<div class="line_en">She did not hear what he said. She dressed by the light of the stars, taking the first things that came to hand; her fingers on a sudden were so clumsy that it seemed to take her an age to find the little clasps that closed her dress. She put round her shoulders the Cantonese shawl she had worn in the evening.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凯蒂听不见他在说什么。她借着星光，伸手捡到什么就穿上。她的手忽然变得极其笨拙，用了好半天也扣不上扣子。她捡了条晚上经常披的广东披肩围到肩膀上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“是霍乱吗？”她终于问道。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I think you ought to come as quickly as you can." He gave her his hand to help her into the boat. The passage was short and the river almost stagnant; they stood in a bunch at the bow, while a woman with a child tied on her hip with one oar impelled the sampan across.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我认为你应该赶紧上来。”他伸出一只手去，把凯蒂拉上了船。河道一点也不宽，河水几乎是静止不动的。他们一排人站在船头，一个女人背上背着一个包囊，里面裹着一个小孩，手里撑着一支橹。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Waddington made no reply.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="韦丁顿不再说话了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The officer, already in his chair, passed by and as he passed called out to Kitty's bearers. They raised the chair smartly, arranged the poles on their shoulders, and at a swift pace set off.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="军官坐的轿子已经抬起来了，走到凯蒂这里的时候，军官朝凯蒂的轿夫喊了一声。轿夫们麻利地把凯蒂的轿子一抬而起，将轿竿往肩膀上一扛，飞快地迈开了步子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Tell the bearers to make haste."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“告诉轿夫让他们快点儿。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Waddington followed close behind. They took the hill at a run, a man with a lantern going before each chair, and at the water-gate the gate-keeper was standing with a torch. The officer shouted to him as they approached and he flung open one side of the gate to let them through. He uttered some sort of interjection as they passed and the bearers called back. In the dead of the night those guttural sounds in a strange language were mysterious and alarming. They slithered up the wet and slippery cobbles of the alley and one of the officer's bearers stumbled. Kitty heard the officer's voice raised in anger, the shrill retort of the bearer, and then the chair in front hurried on again. The streets were narrow and tortuous. Here in the city was deep night. It was a city of the dead. They hastened along a narrow lane, turned a corner, and then at a run took a flight of steps; the bearers were beginning to blow hard; they walked with long, rapid strides, in silence; one took out a ragged handkerchief and as he walked wiped from his forehead the sweat that ran down into his eyes; they wound this way and that so that it might have been a maze through which they sped; in the shadow of the shuttered shops sometimes a form seemed to be lying, but you did not know whether it was a man who slept to awake at dawn or a man who slept to awake never; the narrow streets were ghostly in their silent emptiness and when on a sudden a dog barked loudly it sent a shock of terror through Kitty's tortured nerves. She did not know where they went. The way seemed endless. Could they not go faster? Faster. Faster. The time was going and any moment it might be too late.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="韦丁顿的轿子紧紧地尾随在凯蒂的后面。他们很快爬上山路，每顶轿子前边都有人提着灯笼引路。快到水门的时候，远远可以望见守门人擎着火把站在那里张望。军官朝他喊了几声，他马上打开一扇门，放凯蒂他们过去，还说了句好像是问候的话。轿夫回应了一声。在死寂的夜里，这些从喉咙里发出的陌生语言着实显得神秘而骇人。他们摇摇晃晃地钻进了一条巷子，地上铺满了湿滑的石子。军官的一个轿夫打了个趔趄，凯蒂听见军官暴躁地骂了一声，轿夫尖声地辩解了几句，然后轿子又匆匆地重新上了路。街道狭窄曲折，深夜时分的城市俨然是一座死城。他们穿过一条狭窄的胡同，拐了一个弯儿，然后飞快地上了一段台阶。轿夫们开始大口地喘气，但还是默默地迈着大步。一个轿夫拽出一条破烂的毛巾，边走边揩去从额头流到眼睛里的汗水。他们东拐西拐，好像在迷宫里绕弯一样。偶尔能在门窗紧闭的店铺前面看见一两个躺倒的人形，但你猜不到他们是天一亮就会起来，还是永远也醒不过来了。狭窄的街道上阴森森的，一个人影也不见。有时会突然传来狗吠声，使凯蒂饱受煎熬的神经禁不住一震。她不知道他们在朝哪儿走，路好像永远也走不完似的。他们就不能走得再快点儿吗？再快点吧，再快点吧。时间在一分一秒地过去，每拖一分钟都可能是不可挽回的。">查看中文翻译</div>
