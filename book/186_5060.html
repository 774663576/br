<div class="line_en">"I asked, are you ready?" said the Lion.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我问的是，你是否准备这么做。”狮子说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Son of Adam," said Aslan. "Are you ready to undo the wrong that you have done to my sweet country of Narnia on the very day of its birth?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, I don't see what I can do," said Digory. "You see, the Queen ran away and --"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不知道我能做什么，”迪格雷说，“你知道，那女巫已经跑了，而且……”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes," said Digory. He had had for a second some wild idea of saying "I'll try to help you if you'll promise to help my Mother," but he realized in time that the Lion was not at all the sort of person one could try to make bargains with. But when he had said "Yes," he thought of his Mother, and he thought of the great hopes he had had, and how they were all dying away, and a lump came in his throat and tears in his eyes, and he blurted out:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的。”迪格雷说。有那么一瞬间他涌出一个疯狂的念头，想说“你答应帮助治我妈妈的病，我就尽力帮你”，但他马上意识到，不能和狮子讨价还价。然而，他说出“是”的时候，他想起了妈妈，想到曾经有过的宏伟愿望如今全部灰飞烟灭，喉咙里便像堵了一团棉花似的，他含着眼泪脱口说道：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But please, please -- won't you -- can't you give me something that will cure Mother?" Up till then he had been looking at the Lion's great feet and the huge claws on them; now, in his despair, he looked up at its face. What he saw surprised him as much as anything in his whole life. For the tawny face was bent down near his own and (wonder of wonders) great shining tears stood in the Lion's eyes. They were such big, bright tears compared with Digory's own that for a moment he felt as if the Lion must really be sorrier about his Mother than he was himself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可是，对不起，对不起——你愿意——你能给点儿什么可以治我妈妈病的吗？”他本来一直看着狮子粗壮的前腿和两只巨爪，现在，绝望之下，他拾起头看着它的脸。他看到的是一生中最令他惊奇的事。狮子那张黄褐色的脸低垂下来，凑近他的脸，（最令人感到奇怪的是）眼里闪烁着大颗大颗的泪珠。与迪格雷的泪珠相比，狮子的泪珠那么大，那么亮，迪格雷顿时感到，狮子似乎比他自己更加真切地同情他的妈妈。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"My son, my son," said Aslan. "I know. Grief is great. Only you and I in this land know that yet. Let us be good to one another. But I have to think of hundreds of years in the life of Narnia. The Witch whom you have brought into this world will come back to Narnia again. But it need not be yet. It is my wish to plant in Narnia a tree that she will not dare to approach, and that tree will protect Narnia from her for many years. So this land shall have a long, bright morning before any clouds come over the sun. You must get me the seed from which that tree is to grow."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我的孩子，我的孩子，”阿斯兰说，“我知道，的确太不幸了。这片土地上只有你和我懂得这一点。我们之间要相互理解，友好相处。但我必须为纳尼亚的生存作数百年的长远打算。你带进这个世界的女巫还会回来的，但不一定很快。我希望在纳尼亚栽一棵她不敢靠近的树，那棵树将保卫纳尼亚许多年不受她的侵犯。在乌云遮住太阳以前，这片国土将会有一个长久的明亮的早晨。你必须为我去取树种。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes, sir," said Digory. He didn't know how it was to be done but he felt quite sure now that he would be able to do it. The Lion drew a deep breath, stooped its head even lower and gave him a Lion's kiss. And at once Digory felt that new strength and courage had gone into him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，阁下。”迪格雷说。他并不知道如何去做，但他觉得自己肯定可以做好。狮子长长地松了口气，将头低下来，以狮子的方式吻了他。迪格雷立刻感到，新的力量和勇气注入了他的身体“">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I see terribly big mountains, Aslan," said Digory, "I see this river coming down cliffs in a waterfall. And beyond the cliff there are high green hills with forests. And beyond those there are higher ranges that look almost black. And then, far away, there are big snowy mountains all heaped up together -- like pictures of the Alps. And behind those there's nothing but the sky."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我看见高耸的大山，阿斯兰，”迪格雷说，“我看见这条河跌下峭壁，形成一道瀑布。峭壁后面，高高的小山坡上是绿色的森林。再往后，有黑魆魆的更加高大的山脉。在更遥远的地方，是连绵的大雪山——像照片上的阿尔卑斯山一样。雪山后面，除了天空什么也没有了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You see well," said the Lion. "Now the land of Narnia ends where the waterfall comes down, and once you have reached the top of the cliffs you will be out of Narnia and into the Western Wild. You must journey through those mountains till you find a green valley with a blue lake in it, walled round by mountains of ice. At the end of the lake there is a steep, green hill. On the top of that hill there is a garden. In the centre of that garden is a tree. Pluck an apple from that tree and bring it back to me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你看得很清楚，”狮子说，“瀑布就是纳尼亚的边界，一旦你到了峭壁上，就出了纳尼亚，进入西方原始区了。你必须穿越那些高山，找到一条冰山环抱的绿色河谷，那里有一个蓝色的湖泊；湖的尽头，有一座绿色的陡峭的小山。山顶上有座花园，花园的中心有棵树。从树上摘一个苹果带回来给我。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes, sir," said Digory again. He hadn't the least idea of how he was to climb the cliff and find his way among all the mountains, but he didn't like to say that for fear it would sound like making excuses. But he did say, "I hope, Aslan, you're not in a hurry. I shan't be able to get there and back very quickly."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好的，阁下。”迪格雷又说。他根本不知道如何才能攀越那些高山峭壁，但他不愿说，生怕听上去好像他在找借口。可他还是说，“我希望，阿斯兰，你不是很着急的。我来回一趟不可能很快。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Little son of Adam, you shall have help," said Aslan. He then turned to the Horse who had been standing quietly beside them all this time, swishing his tail to keep the flies off, and listening with his head on one side as if the conversation were a little difficult to understand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“小小的亚当的儿子，你会得到帮助的。”阿斯兰说着转向那匹马。它一直静静地站在他们旁边，尾巴一摇一摆地驱赶苍蝇，偏着头听他们说话，似乎要理解这对话有点儿困难。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">You should have seen how the Horse shook its mane and how its nostrils widened, and the little tap it gave the ground with one back hoof. Clearly it would very much like to be a winged horse. But it only said:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="你要是在场的话，就能看见那匹马鬃毛摇晃、鼻孔大张、后蹄轻轻踏地的样子。显然，它巴不得成为一匹飞马。但它只说：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The horse shied, just as it might have shied in the old, miserable days when it pulled a hansom. Then it roared. It strained its neck back as if there were a fly biting its shoulders and it wanted to scratch them. And then, just as the beasts had burst out of the earth, there burst out from the shoulders of Fledge wings that spread and grew, larger than eagles', larger than swans', larger than angels' wings in church windows. The feathers shone chestnut colour and copper colour. He gave a great sweep with them and leaped into the air. Twenty feet above Aslan and Digory he snorted, neighed, and curvetted. Then, after circling once round them, he dropped to the earth, all four hoofs together, looking awkward and surprised, but extremely pleased.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那匹马吃惊地倒退了一步，在它拉车的悲惨岁月里，它可能也像今天这样受过惊。然后，它用后腿站起来，扭着脖子，仿佛想捉住叮咬它肩膀的苍蝇似的。接着，犹如动物们先前从地里蹦出来一样，弗兰奇的肩上钻出一对翅膀，越长越宽，越长越大，超过了鹰的翅膀、天鹅的翅膀和教堂窗户上天使的翅膀。这对翅膀的羽毛呈栗色和铜色。它猛地展翅，冲向空中，在阿斯兰和迪格雷头上二十多英尺高的空中打着响鼻、嘶鸣、腾跃。围着他们转了一圈后，它降落下来，四蹄一并，看上去有点儿不熟练，有点儿惊讶，但十分欢喜。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"If you wish, Aslan -- if you really mean -- I don't know why it should be me -- I'm not a very clever horse."</div>

<div class="line_en">"What? Now? At once?" said Strawberry -- or Fledge, as we must now call him -- "Hurrah! Come, little one, I've had things like you on my back before. Long, long ago. When there were green fields; and sugar."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Do not fly too high," said Aslan. "Do not try to go over the tops of the great ice-mountains. Look out for the valleys, the green places, and fly through them. There will always be a way through. And now, begone with my blessing."</div>

<div class="line_en">All Narnia, many-coloured with lawns and rocks and heather and different sorts of trees, lay spread out below them, the river winding through it like a ribbon of quicksilver. They could already see over the tops of the low hills which lay northward on their right; beyond those hills a great moorland sloped gently up and up to the horizon. On their left the mountains were much higher, but every now and then there was a gap when you could see, between steep pine woods, a glimpse of the southern lands that lay beyond them, looking blue and far away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="整个纳尼亚展开在他们脚下，草地、岩石、石南属植物和千姿百态的树木将大地染得五彩缤纷，蜿蜒的河流像一条水银的带子。右望北方，小山的那一边，是一片缓缓斜升至地平线的沼地。左边的山高得多，但不时可见一个个峡谷。从那儿望过去，透过挺拔的松林，能瞥见南方蔚蓝的土地，远远地绵延伸展。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Next moment the country dropped away beneath them, and whirled round as Fledge, like a huge pigeon, circled once or twice before setting off on his long westward flight. Looking down, Polly could hardly see the King and the Queen, and even Aslan himself was only a bright yellow spot on the green grass. Soon the wind was in their faces and Fledges wings settled down to a steady beat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="很快，那片国土就被他们远远地抛在了下面。随着弗兰奇像鸽子般一圈两圈地转着，大地也跟着旋转起来。然后，弗兰奇转向西方，开始了漫长的飞行。波莉低头俯视，几乎看不见国王和王后了，连阿斯兰也只是绿草中一个亮亮的黄点。马上便有风刮在他们脸上。弗兰奇的翅膀有节奏地扇动起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

They were flying so high already that the thunder of those falls could only just be heard as a small, thin sound, but they were not yet high enough to fly over the top of the cliffs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="悬崖峭壁在他们眼前竖起一道巨大的屏障，阳光在大瀑布上闪烁，令人目眩。来自西边高地的河水咆哮着，水花飞溅地流进纳尼亚境内。他们已经飞得很高，瀑布雷鸣般的巨响已变得很轻。但他们飞行的高度还不能越过峭壁。">查看中文翻译</div>

They were flying over a wild country of steep hills and dark forests, still following the course of the river. The really big mountains loomed ahead. But the sun was now in the travellers' eyes and they couldn't see things very clearly in that direction. For the sun sank lower and lower till the western sky was all like one great furnace full of melted gold; and it set at last behind a jagged peak which stood up against the brightness as sharp and flat as if it were cut out of cardboard.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“来，美美地吃上一顿。”弗兰奇说着，咬下一大口草。然后它抬起头，嚼着，嘴角边像胡须一样支出几根草节。“你们两个快来吃。别不好意思，够我们三人吃的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This was a difficult and delicate job but they managed it in the end. The little paper bag was very squashy and sticky when they finally got it out, so that it was more a question of tearing the bag off the toffees than of getting the toffees out of the bag. Some grown-ups (you know how fussy they can be about that sort of thing) would rather have gone without supper altogether than eaten those toffees. There were nine of them all told. It was Digory who had the bright idea of eating four each and planting the ninth; for, as he said, "if the bar off the lamp-post turned into a little light-tree, why shouldn't this turn into a toffee-tree?" So they dibbled a small hole in the turf and buried the piece of toffee. Then they ate the other pieces, making them last as long as they could. It was a poor meal, even with all the paper they couldn't help eating as well.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这件事非常棘手，搞不好就会弄糟，但最后还是成功了。他们拿出来的小纸袋又软又湿，黏糊糊的，所以，从糖上撕下纸袋要比从口袋里拿出糖来更困难。有些大人（你知道他们遇到这种事时会如何大惊小怪地瞎忙乎一阵），宁愿不吃晚饭也不愿吃那些太妃糖。一共有九颗。迪格雷想出一个好办法，每人吃四颗，将第九颗种在地里。他说：“从灯柱上取下的铁棒都能长成一个小灯柱，这颗糖为什么不能长成一棵太妃糖树呢？”于是，他们在草皮上挖了一个小洞，埋下了那颗太妃糖，然后，开始吃剩下的八颗，尽可能久地慢慢品味。那是一顿糟糕的晚餐，即使糖纸全部黏在上面，他们也不得不吃下去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Digory said that Polly had better take herself home by ring and get something to eat there; he couldn't himself because he had promised to go straight on his message for Aslan, and, if once he showed up again at home, anything might happen to prevent his getting back. But Polly said she wouldn't leave him, and Digory said it was jolly decent of her.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="三位同伴竭尽全力地仔细倾听。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When Fledge had quite finished his own excellent supper he lay down. The children came and sat one on each side of him leaning against his warm body, and when he had spread a wing over each they were really quite snug. As the bright young stars of that new world came out they talked over everything: how Digory had hoped to get something for his Mother and how, instead of that, he had been sent on this message. And they repeated to one another all the signs by which they would know the places they were looking for -- the blue lake and the hill with a garden on top of it. The talk was just beginning to slow down as they got sleepy, when suddenly Polly sat up wide awake and said "Hush!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="弗兰奇吃完丰盛的晚餐后躺了下来，孩子们坐在它的两边，靠着它温暖的躯体。它伸开翅膀盖住他们，使他们更感温暖和舒适。当新世界明亮而年轻的星星升起来时，他们开始谈天说地：迪格雷当初多么希望为他的妈妈弄点儿什么，后来又是如何被派遣来执行这项任务。他们一再地提及他们要找的那个地方的特征——蓝色的湖泊，山顶上有座花园。直到睡意袭来，他们的谈话才减慢了。突然，波莉惊醒坐了起来：“嘘！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Perhaps it was only the wind in the trees," said Digory presently.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“也许只是树间的风声吧。”过了一会儿迪格雷说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm not so sure," said Fledge. "Anyway -- wait! There it goes again. By Aslan, it is something."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不敢肯定，”弗兰奇说，“不管怎么说——等等！有动静。凭阿斯兰起誓，是有什么。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The horse scrambled to its feet with a great noise and a great upheaval; the children were already on theirs. Fledge trotted to and fro, sniffing and whinnying. The children tip-toed this way and that, looking behind every bush and tree. They kept on thinking they saw things, and there was one time when Polly was perfectly certain she had seen-a tall, dark figure gliding quickly away in a westerly direction. But they caught nothing and in the end Fledge lay down again and the children re-snuggled (if that is the right word) under his wings. They went to sleep at once. Fledge stayed awake much longer moving his ears to and fro in the darkness and sometimes giving a little shiver with his skin as if a fly had lighted on him: but in the end he too slept.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="马猛地一蹶，发出很大的响声，匆忙爬了起来。孩子们已经站好了。弗兰奇前前后后地小跑着，嗅着，发出低低的嘶鸣；孩子们蹑手蹑脚地在每一丛灌木和每一棵树后巡查。他们一直认为自己看见了什么。有一次，波莉非常肯定地说，她看见一个高大的黑影迅速地溜向西方。但他们什么也没有找到。最后，弗兰奇又躺下了，孩子们偎依（如果可以用这个词的话）在马的翅膀下，很快就睡着了。弗兰奇好长时间都醒着，在黑暗中前后移动它的耳朵，有时皮肤轻轻地战栗一下，似乎有只苍蝇落在它身上，但最后它也睡着了。">查看中文翻译</div>
