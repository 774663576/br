A letter has just arrived for Miss Fairlie -- a horrible, unsigned letter, warning her not to marry Sir Percival Glyde. It has upset my sister very much.

There was no reason at all for me to connect Sir Percival Glyde with the man who had made Anne Catherick so afraid -- but I did.

<div class="line_en">We questioned the servants and learnt that the letter had been delivered by an elderly woman, who had then disappeared in the direction of the village. People in Limmeridge remembered seeing the woman, but no one could tell us who she was or where she had come from. Finally, I suggested asking the school teacher. As we approached the school door, we could hear the teacher shouting at one of the boys, saying angrily that there were no such things as ghosts. It was an awkward moment, but we went in anyway and asked our question. The teacher could tell us nothing. However, as we turned to leave, Miss Halcombe spoke to the boy standing in the corner:</div>

Below the cloak a little of her dress was visible -- a white dress. The other woman said something to her companion, and then walked away round the corner of the church, leaving the woman in the cloak next to the grave. After looking all around her, she took out a cloth, kissed the white cross and started to clean it.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the churchyard I examined Mrs Fairlie's grave carefully, and noticed that the gravestone had been partly cleaned. Perhaps the person who had done the cleaning would return to finish the job. I decided to come back that evening and watch.

<div class="line_en">At dinner that evening -- my last dinner at Limmeridge House -- it was a hard battle to keep my self-control. I saw that it was not easy for Miss Fairlie, either. She gave me her hand as she had done in happier days, but her fingers trembled and her face was pale. Mr Gilmore kept the conversation going, and afterwards we went into the sitting room as usual. Miss Fairlie sat at the piano.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天吃晚饭的时候——我在利默里奇庄园的最后一次晚饭——我努力控制自己的情感。我看得出费尔利小姐也非常不自在。像以前快乐的日子里一样，她把手伸给我，但她的手指在颤抖，脸上没有一点血色。只有吉尔摩先生滔滔不绝地说这说那，之后大家像往常一样来到客厅。费尔利小姐坐到了钢琴旁。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The next morning I found Miss Halcombe and Miss Fairlie waiting for me downstairs. When I began to speak, Miss Fairlie turned and hurried from the room. I tried to control my voice, but could only say, "Will you write to me, Miss Halcombe?"</div>

<div class="line_en">She left, and a few seconds later Miss Fairlie returned, holding something. It was her own sketch of the summer-house where we had first met. With tears in her eyes, she offered it to me," to remind you", she whispered. My own tears fell as I kissed her hand, then I turned to go. She sank into a chair, her head dropped on her arms. At that moment I knew that Laura Fairlie loved me too. But it was over. We were separated.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她离开片刻后，费尔利小姐回来了，手里还拿着什么东西。那是她自己画的我们初次相见的凉亭。她眼里噙着泪水，把画递给我。“留个纪念吧。”她轻声说。我吻着她的手，眼泪禁不住流了下来。我转身离去。她一下子跌坐到椅子上，头垂到了手臂上。那一刻，我明白劳拉·费尔利也在爱着我。但是，一切都结束了，我们被分开了。">查看中文翻译</div>
