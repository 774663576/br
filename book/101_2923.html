He tried to run faster, but his father passed him and stopped the pickup just ahead, then jumped out and ran back. He picked Jess up in his arms as though he were a baby. For the first few seconds Jess kicked and struggled against the strong arms. Then Jess gave himself over to the numbness that was buzzing to be let out from a corner of his brain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="小卡车噼噼啪啪的声音从他的后面传了过来，但他不能回头。他试图加速，但他爸爸把车从他身边开过，停在了他的前面，然后跳下向他跑来。他把杰斯抱了起来，就好像他是一个婴儿一样。起初几秒他还在他强壮的胳膊里又踢又闹，然而随后他就沉湎于麻木之中，这种感觉从他大脑一角钻了出来嗡嗡作响。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Leslie -- dead -- girl friend -- rope -- broke -- fell -- you -- you -- you. The words exploded in his head like corn against the sides of the popper.

It was up to him. He had to keep going.</div>

<div class="line_en">He was awake, jerked suddenly into consciousness in the black stillness of the house. He sat up, stiff and shivering, although he was fully dressed from his windbreaker down to his sneakers. He could hear the breathing of the little girls in the next bed, strangely loud and uneven in the quiet. Some dream must have awakened him, but he could not remember it. He could only remember the mood of dread it had brought with it. Through the curtainless window he could see the lopsided moon with hundreds of stars dancing in bright attendance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他醒着，在这座黑暗的寂静房子里，意识突然陷入了抽搐。他坐了起来，僵硬，还发抖，尽管他从防风夹克到运动鞋穿得整整齐齐。他可以听到小女孩儿们在另一张床上呼吸的声音。那声音在这寂静中显得出奇地响亮、不平稳。一定是什么梦把他惊醒了，可是他不记得了，他只记得那梦给他带来的恐惧。透过没有窗帘的窗户，他可以看到歪斜的月亮，还有成百上千的明亮的星星闪烁着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When they pulled up at his house, his father sat quietly, and Jess could feel the man's uncertainty, so he opened the door and got out, and with the numbness flooding through him, went in and lay down on his bed.</div>

<div class="line_en">It came into his mind that someone had told him that Leslie was dead. But he knew now that that had been part of the dreadful dream. Leslie could not die any more than he himself could die. But the words turned over uneasily in his mind like leaves stirred up by a cold wind. If he got up now and went down to the old Perkins place and knocked on the door, Leslie would come to open it, P. T. jumping at her heels like a star around the moon. It was a beautiful night. Perhaps they could run over the hill and across the fields to the stream and swing themselves into Terabithia.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他想起有人告诉他莱斯利已经死了。但他知道这是那噩梦的一部分。莱斯利不可能死，正像他自己不可能死了一样。然而，那些话像被冷风卷起的叶子，在他脑海里不安地翻来覆去。如果他现在起床，去帕金斯老宅敲门，莱斯利会来开门的，P.T。会在她腿边乱跳，就像星星绕着月亮一样。这是一个美丽的夜晚，或许他们可以跑过山丘和田野，跑到小溪前，然后荡进特雷比西亚。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They had never been there in the dark. But there was enough moon for them to find their way into the castle, and he could tell her about his day in Washington. And apologize. It had been so dumb of him not to ask if Leslie could go, too. He and Leslie and Miss Edmunds could have had a wonderful day -- different, of course, from the day he and Miss Edmunds had had, but still good, still perfect. Miss Edmunds and Leslie liked each other a lot. It would have been fun to have Leslie along. I'm really sorry, Leslie. He took off his jacket and sneakers, and crawled under the covers. I was dumb not to think of asking.</div>
