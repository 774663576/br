<div class="line_en">Hong Kong helped me to cross the border gently. It was China in some ways, but in others it wasn't. I could meet English friends for a cocktail in the Captain's Bar at the Mandarin Oriental, or I could watch live fish being dismembered in the Wanchai wetmarket; I could windowshop in the glitzy designer boutiques of Central, or lose myself in the feverish backstreets of Kowloon. I remember, on that first trip, entering a Chinese temple, the Man-Mo, in the old Chinese trading district of Sheung Wan. In the red-glowing, gold-gleaming, cavern-like interior, old ladies shook out their fortune-telling sticks and candles flickered. The strange gilded statues and smouldering coils of incense brought me out in goosepimples. But then I was able to take a taxi back into a more familiar world, meeting Sebastian and his girlfriend for dinner and English conversation. By the time I boarded the train that ran to the border with China proper, my fear had abated and I was ready to face the Mainland for the first time.</div>

<div class="line_en">When I finally left Hunan, I stayed for a few days with some English friends in Hong Kong before flying back to London. I felt completely disorientated. I didn't know how to express myself and had forgotten how to behave like a normal English person. My friend Rob, who I have known since we were teenagers, and his wife Leslie helped me to ease myself out of my Chinese life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最终我还是离开了湖南，然后去香港跟几个英国朋友住了几天，再飞回伦敦。我特别手足无措，完全不知道如何表达自己，也忘了正常的英国人该怎么表现。我从十几岁起就在牛津认识的朋友罗伯和他的妻子莱斯利帮我平稳地走出了中国生活。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In my years of travelling back and forth, I have come to think of Hong Kong as a kind of decompression chamber, a halfway house between home and China. It's been like that for me ever since my first visit, when I stayed with my cousin Sebastian in his apartment in Wanchai, on Hong Kong Island. Then, I was so terrified of my impending trip to China that I wondered if I could go through with it. I woke up every morning and looked through the window towards the Mainland, cold with fear.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sebastian sat me down and told me everything that had happened while I'd been away: Oasis, Brit Pop, the National Lottery. And there was this new thing, he said, the Internet, that everyone was talking about. It was going to change the way we did everything. Shell-shocked by the sudden assault of news, cars, and Western advertisements, and the frantic pace of life in Hong Kong, I didn't really understand what he was talking about.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="塞巴斯蒂安让我坐定，把我离群索居时外面发生的事情一五一十地讲给我听：绿洲乐队、英伦摇滚运动（2）、英国国家彩票（3）。对了，还出了个新鲜玩意儿，他说，叫互联网，人人都在说。这东西会完全改变我们的生活。突然间的新闻爆炸，突然间的车水马龙，充斥着视觉与听觉的西方广告和香港疯狂的生活节奏叫我一时间适应不了，有点蒙，并没有真正理解他的意思。【注：（2）英伦摇滚运动（Britpop）是二十世纪九十年代中期从英国发起的音乐和文化运动，强调音乐风格上回归英国特色，绿洲乐队是其中的代表乐队。（3）英国国家彩票是英国政府在一九九四年十一月推出的一种新型彩票制度，当时引起了英国的全民关注，很多人都因此做起了一夜暴富之梦。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Three years later, on my way back from Chengdu at the end of my cooking course, I stayed with Sebastian again. Once more, I was in a state of potentially traumatic transition. For eighteen months I had been completely immersed in China, and had had very little contact with anyone at home, even my family. My perfect Oxford English was going to seed, because I had become used to speaking with people for whom English was a second language. In the Sichuan University dormitory, we had coined our own lingua franca, a mixture of English and Chinese with a bit of Italian and French thrown in. So I'd picked up all kinds of English phrases and neologisms that weren't really English, and my syntax was often a little foreign. I was badly dressed too, as I remember, with my army boots and cheap Chinese clothes. I felt like a peasant, completely out of touch with the slick modernity of Hong Kong.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="三年后，我上完烹饪课从成都返回时，又到塞巴斯蒂安那里暂歇。我又一次陷入身份转变的危机，还是也许会造成心理创伤的那种。十八个月以来，我完全沉浸在中国的生活当中，很少和家乡联系，连家人都没怎么理。我原本流利的牛津英语退化了，因为长久以来对话的那些人英语都只是第二语言，而我已经习惯了。在川大的宿舍里，我们发明了“内部通用语”，中英文混杂，偶尔还夹杂点意大利语和法语。所以我习惯了一些并不地道的英语短语和词汇，我的语法也带上了点儿异域风情。我的穿衣品味也变得土里土气：脚蹬军绿解放靴，身穿廉价中国衣。我觉得自己就是个乡巴佬，与光鲜又摩登的香港完全格格不入。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When I haven't visited the Hong Kong decompression chamber on my way into deepest China, or at least spent some time in the lesser decompression chambers of Shanghai or Beijing, I have been struck with the bends. Flying direct from London to Changsha, for example, pausing only to change planes in Beijing, is a disaster. I feel uprooted and horribly confused every time. My tongue gets lost in a linguistic soup of English, Mandarin and dialect, and I find it hard to function socially for at least a couple of days. Hong Kong gives me the space to brace myself on my way into China, and to collect my thoughts and impressions on the way home.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="要是在“深潜”入中国腹地和上岸的往返旅程之间没有到香港（或者稍差一点意思的上海、北京）这个“减压舱”待一待，我就会得“减压病”。比如，要是直接从伦敦飞长沙，只是在北京短暂停留转机，那简直就是灾难。我每次都觉得自己像突然被连根拔起，异常困惑迷茫。英语、普通话和湖南方言像一锅乱炖，让我舌头打结，不知如何开口，而且至少有两三天很难去社交。香港给了我一个空间，去中国的路上能先稍微适应一下，做好心理建设；回家的路上能整理下思绪，找找做英国人的感觉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">My heart was heavy that week: leaving Sichuan had wrenched me. I stood one sunny afternoon in a secluded spot on the shore of the Tai Tam reservoir on Hong Kong Island, practising the qi gong movements I'd learned from my elderly teacher in that temple garden in Chengdu, trying to create a sense of continuity between the present, the immediate future and the life I was leaving behind. By the time I finally arrived at my parents' home in Oxford, I was ready to do what felt like stepping on to dry land again, after years at sea.</div>

<div class="line_en">It works like this because everybody there is on the brink, like the place itself. My Hong Kong friends know what it's like to be juggling cultures on a daily basis. We can all swing either way, East or West, and we eat ambidextrously. In conversation, there is much that doesn't need to be explained, which is a huge relief. And Hong Kong is multicultural and international in a way that China still isn't. Even the taxi drivers speak a mix of Cantonese, Mandarin and English.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="香港能起到这种作用，是因为这里的每个人都和这座城市一样，位于交界之处。我香港的朋友早就习惯了每天在不同文化之间游刃有余。我们都能东西转化、来去自如，饮食习惯也是随遇而安。和他们聊天不用多解释什么，这实在让我轻松自在了许多。那时香港的文化多样性与国际化是中国大多数地方所不及的，就连出租车司机也能粤普英三语混杂着跟你聊上一段。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sometimes these days, when I'm in a totally English environment -- a Fulham dinner-party scenario, say -- I feel like a foreigner, with my altered perspectives and traveller's tales. And in China, of course, I'm all too often still a big-nosed barbarian. But Hong Kong has been a hybrid ever since the British Crown wrested the unlikely island, with its deep and sheltered harbour, from China at the end of the first Opium War in 1842. Hong Kong people will choose, in an evenhanded way, whether to have croissants and Italian coffee or steamed chickens' feet with oolong tea for breakfast. They might go out for a bit of 'soy sauce Western food', or shop in a delicatessen that sells both dried abalone and Spanish membrillo. Everybody dips their deep-fried prawn dim sum in salad cream; their beancurd rolls in Worcestershire sauce. To visiting tourists this seems like a bastardisation; in Hong Kong, it makes perfect sense.</div>

<div class="line_en">I first met Rose through some old friends who thought we might get along. And although at first it seemed as though we might have little in common -- Rose is a slick, international businesswoman after all, while I am a writer living in a dodgy part of East London -- we never run out of things to say. Because despite her appearance -- as petite and delicate as a fawn, and always impeccably well dressed -- Rose is a gourmet extraordinaire and a restaurant sleuth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有几个老朋友介绍我认识了“冷玫瑰”，觉得我俩能成为好朋友。乍看上去我俩好像没什么共同之处。冷玫瑰是位女商人，成熟老练、打扮光鲜，浑身上下一股国际范儿；而我是个作家，住在伦敦东部一个挺偏僻的地方。结果两个女人一见如故，聊起来没完没了。玫瑰看上去苗条精致，像只优雅的小鹿，而且穿着打扮总是无可挑剔；在这副好皮囊之外，她还是位出色的美食家，用舌头来探查各家餐馆。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Whenever I'm planning to visit Hong Kong, I email Rose, and before the day is out, I'm at the receiving end of the first of a volley of replies, each one outlining suggestions of yet more restaurants and food shops to visit, delicacies to try, and food people to meet. Rose is a social chameleon, like many glamorous and well-heeled Hong Kong Chinese. Raised in Chicago by her Chinese parents, she speaks fluent English, Cantonese and Shanghai dialect, and passable Mandarin. She is equally at home in Chinese or international society, and with Chinese or Western food. One weekend she will be flying to Barcelona for dinner at the world's most exclusive restaurant, El Bulli, the next she will be crammed into a tiny upstairs room in Sheung Wan, eating raw crabs with her fingers and chomping her way through a Chiuchow stewed goose with garlic vinegar.</div>

<div class="line_en">Soon after our first meeting some five years ago, Rose arranged a Sunday lunch for our mutual friends and me at the Ningbo Residents Association restaurant. It was the kind of restaurant I could never have found on my own, tucked away in an office building and officially open only to the association's members. Rose ordered for us all in fluent Shanghai dialect, and the meal was a revelation. There were smoked eggs, their yolks like liquid gold; tiny clams steamed in a delicate, savoury custard; braised meatballs with bamboo shoot and shiitake mushrooms; chopped Indian aster leaves with dry beancurd and sesame oil; a scrumptious mash of broad beans with preserved greens and dried scallops; and, most remarkable of all, cold, raw mud snails steeped in sweet Shaoxing wine, their shells so thinly crisp they could be eaten whole. Afterwards, we filled up on sesame flatbreads and sticky rice-cake stir-fried with bamboo shoot.</div>

<div class="line_en">It is testament to the diversity of Chinese cuisine that after more than ten years of dedicated research, I encounter new ingredients and new dishes not only every single time I visit the country, but often every single day. Even in Chengdu, which I know better than anywhere else in China, I am constantly surprised, and in Hong Kong, which I dip into every couple of years, the novelties flow thick and fast. Of course, it helps to have friends like Rose, who have their noses to the ground, sniffing out all kinds of delicacies hidden like truffles in the back alleys. By now I associate Hong Kong with these little gastronomic expeditions to basement delicatessens, teeming wet markets, restaurants in unlikely places, and tea shops in the backstreets of Sheung Wan or Central.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="经过十多年投入地研究与走访，我每次来到中国，甚至经常是身在这里的每一天，都能遇到新的食材与新的菜肴，这充分说明了中餐的博大精深与丰富多彩。就连我在中国最熟悉的成都，也总能让我连连吃惊；香港这个我每隔几年进行短暂造访的地方就更不用说了，各种新奇的东西总是迎面扑来。当然啦，有玫瑰这种鼻子贴在地面上、能把藏在深宅陋巷中如松露一样珍贵的各种佳肴都嗅到的朋友，我更是如有神助。现在我一想起香港，就觉得那里充满一次次小小的美食冒险，比如地下室的熟食店、热闹的老市场、出其不意的餐馆、上环与中环狭窄小街中的茶社。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One of the places Rose introduced me to was the Lin Heung teahouse on Wellington Street, a rare survivor of the old teahouse culture of Hong Kong. I went there one morning for breakfast and warmed to it immediately. Outside, a woman was laying out the day's newspapers on a stand; inside, at just after 6 a. m., it was already busy, and the air hummed with Cantonese chatter. Most of the customers were elderly or middle-aged working men. Some sat alone, engrossed in the papers as they slurped tea and ate their breakfast; others gossipped with their friends. Bleary-eyed after my early rising, I found a perch at one end of a glass-topped table, and a waiter swiftly brought me my bowl, teacup and spoon, and a pot of musty pu'er tea. Soon waitresses were passing by with their trolleys, calling out the names of dumplings and other titbits. One lifted the lids of towers of small bamboo steamers to offer me fluffy buns stuffed with pork, and small dishes containing folds of tripe. Another had sticky rice with chicken, wrapped in fragrant lotus leaves. The tea-waiters rushed around with their kettles, replenishing teapots and bowls. Every few minutes, more customers arrived, and the clamour of conversation grew louder, mixing with the clatter of teacups.</div>

'The tea is good, the water is good, and the boss is a smart man, he doesn't cheat us, he knows how to keep everyone happy,' he told me as he prodded the pile of Dragon Well tealeaves in his cup. His friend Mr Lau, eighty-three, said he had been a regular for fifty years. 'I come every day,' he told me, 'and some of the staff have been here for decades, too.

<div class="line_en">Lin Heung, or 'Lotus Fragrance', was founded in the 1920s, although it has moved several times from its original location. The first such teahouses opened in Hong Kong in the 1840s, but they began to flourish only after 1897, when the British authorities abolished their night-time curfew for Chinese people. From the 1920s until the 1940s, they sprang up all over the territory, and they acquired a vital social function in the post-war economic boom. Whole families were then living in cramped accommodation, sharing apartments with limited cooking facilities, or even no kitchen at all. Teahouses were cheap and convenient, as much for family meals as entertaining guests or discussing business. Some became known for particular trades, like the Kam Kong restaurant, frequented by dealers of watches and gemstones; others for their board games or musical entertainments. Visiting a teahouse became so central to Hong Kong life that people began to greet one another by asking, 'Have you had tea yet?' instead of the more traditional, 'Have you eaten?'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莲香楼是二十世纪二十年代开办的，不过已经从最初的地址搬迁了好几次。这类茶楼最早出现在香港是十九世纪四十年代，但直到一八九七年英国当局取消了中国人的宵禁之后才兴旺起来。从二十世纪二十年代一直到四十年代，茶楼在香港遍地开花，在战后经济繁荣的背景下被赋予了重要的社交功能。那时候的香港，常有一大家子人挤在小小的住家里，共用厨房设施有限的公寓，有的甚至根本没有厨房。茶楼又便宜又方便，家宴、待客、谈生意都可以。有的茶楼因为某些行业的人常去而著名，比如襟江酒楼就总有很多手表与宝石商人光顾；还有的是棋类游戏或音乐表演聚集地。去茶楼变成香港生活的重中之重，熟人见面问候都会来一句“饮咗茶未吖”而不是比较传统的“食咗未”（8）。【注：（8）“饮咗茶未”意思是“喝茶了吗”，“食咗未”意思是“吃了吗”。】">查看中文翻译</div>

After a swift steaming, the faint pink of the prawns glows through the pearly translucence of the wrapper, with its neatly pinched edge. The prawns are simultaneously crisp and tender, the wrapper soft and glutinous in the mouth. Cheung fun, sheets of slithery rice pasta wrapped around deep-fried doughsticks, barbecued pork or fresh prawn, and served with a drizzling of sweetened soy sauce, are made by pouring a thin riceflour batter on to a sheet of muslin, steaming it, and then wrapping it around the chosen stuffing with a few flips of a spatula blade. Steamed char siu buns are soft and fluffy, their white dough breaking open into a smile of barbecued pork in a savoury-sweet sauce.</div>

<div class="line_en">While the teahouse ritual is known as yum cha ('drink tea'), the dumplings and other 'small eats' that are traditionally served are known collectively as dim sum, the Cantonese dialect form of the Mandarin dian xin. Dian xin is a curious term that defies direct translation into English, but means something like 'touch the heart'. It dates back at least to the Song Dynasty, when historical sources mention it as a name for the snacks customarily served for breakfast. Though dian xin are eaten all over China, it is in Hong Kong and the Cantonese south that they are most dazzling and abundant.</div>

<div class="line_en">Booming properties prices and competition from restaurants spelled the end of the heyday of the Hong Kong teahouses. ('If it doesn't move, build on it', Hong Kong people quip). Their vast, sprawling premises were knocked down and replaced by skyscrapers; some teahouses moved to new locations, but most of them closed down for good. These days people flock to Lin Heung for a glimpse of the past, or the smarter Luk Yu teahouse nearby in Central. Luk Yu, named after the Tang Dynasty scholar who wrote a treatise on tea in the eighth century, was founded in 1933 and retains its old wooden panelling and atmosphere of edgy glamour. In 2002 it was actually the scene of a triad killing: a local property tycoon was shot in the head as he ate his breakfast. Here, in the mornings, you can still find waiters carrying snacks on trays slung around their necks, a style of service that predates the trolley.</div>

<div class="line_en">A dim sum breakfast or lunch is a casual and often chaotic affair, but it has a few of its own, particular rituals. You may thank your host for pouring tea into your cup by tapping your index and middle fingers lightly on the table. This practice is said to date back to the late eighteenth century, when the Qianlong Emperor went on one of his fact-finding missions to the south of China. Travelling incognito, as emperors sometimes did in those days in an attempt to understand what was really going on in their realm, he dropped in on a teahouse with his small retinue. When the emperor poured them some tea, his footmen were flustered, because palace etiquette dictated that they should respond by falling to their knees, and yet they knew they should not give away his disguise. So they tapped their two fingers on the table as a miniature form of prostration, laying the foundations of a habit that remains common in Cantonese communities all over the world.</div>

<div class="line_en">After my breakfast in Lin Heung, I wandered out into the streets of Central. In a market, an old woman was stripping the green peel from tangerines, releasing their sharp, citrus fragrance into the air. Nearby, the sweet, heavy scent of freshly baked custard tarts drifted out from a small bakery. Cured meats and sausages hung over market stalls; butchers worked with cleavers on wooden blocks. Behind every shopfront, red lamps glowed before shrines to protective deities. Hong Kong Island may have one of the world's most hypermodern skylines, and an infrastructure so efficient it makes you think cramming over a million people on to a tiny piece of land in the South China Sea is a great idea, but at street level, away from the designer shops and the grand hotels, you can still find the grit, the intense physical sensations, and the echoes of a much older China that give the city-territory its enduring appeal.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a soggy, sultry day. Rose had texted me the address of the restaurant. It was hard to find, hidden among the cafés and bars of the entertainment district. There was nothing around the nondescript entrance to suggest that this might be a place to eat: just a street number, and a dank concrete hallway leading inside. But the address seemed right, so I stepped inside, and took the small, dark lift to the fourth floor as instructed. There, I stumbled into a florist's workshop, where a Chinese woman was trimming leaves from the stems of roses. 'You here for the restaurant?' she asked. I nodded, and she pointed me towards an apartment door covered by a steel grill. A sign above bore the name of a company importing household goods. It didn't look promising, but the number was correct so I rang the bell.</div>

<div class="line_en">A few seconds later, the inner door opened, and a man's face appeared behind the bars, looking blankly at me. 'Is this the right place for lunch?' I asked, doubtfully. He clicked open the grill for a second, and invited me in. The walls of the small, scruffy apartment were lined with cabinets filled with files and stacked boxes of napkins and tablecloths. More boxes were piled up on shelves near the ceiling, just as you'd expect from a company importing household goods.

<div class="line_en">The restaurant -- I wouldn't tell you its name, even if it had one -- was just one of the so-called 'private kitchens' (si fang cai) of Hong Kong. These illicit, small-scale eateries first sprang up in the wake of the Asian economic crisis of 1997.

Some were so popular that you had to wait months for a table.</div>

It's not uncommon to find rich men cracking open seriously expensive bottles of wine in some cramped backstreet café with chipped formica tables. And if you wander through the Wanchai wet market, you can be sure to see chauffeur-driven Mercedes parked nearby, their motors running as the tai tais (the Hong Kong equivalent of Ladies Who Lunch) buy impeccably fresh vegetables and seafood for their Thai or Filipina housekeepers to cook.

My editor had asked for 'the ultimate guide to eating in Hong Kong', and since I am very conscientious but had only five or six days at my disposal, I had to eat more-or-less non stop from morning till night. I would begin with dim sum, congee and/or noodles, then have a couple of lunches, spend the afternoon grazing in various food shops and cafés, and end the day with at least one dinner. I ranged widely in my explorations, from the grand Spring Moon restaurant at the Peninsula Hotel, with its fine teas and marvellous barbecued pigeons infused with osmanthus, to Mak's Noodles, where I lunched on prawn wontons in soup.</div>

Another had a chef who worked during the day as a biochemical engineer; his hobby was cooking, so he spent his nights slaving over a hot stove, producing modernised Shanghainese delicacies such as a salad of beansprouts and fresh yellow lilies, and braised pork ribs with honey and vinegar. One of the earliest and most famous private kitchens, Da Ping Huo, was run by a Sichuanese artist and his wife who had shipments of chilli and Sichuan pepper delivered every week from Chengdu.

<div class="line_en">I ate many delicious things during that week, but the best meal of all was the last, a late-night supper in Cheung Fat, an old Chiuchow café in the district of Kowloon called Kowloon City. Chiuchow, or Chaozhou, is a region in the north-east of Guangdong Province with a distinctive cuisine that is little known outside Asia. In the nineties, when Hong Kong people had money to splash around, Chiuchow delicacies made with high-class (and high-price) ingredients like shark's fin or conch were all the rage. To me, however, the folk cooking of the region is far more inspiring. Chiuchow people specialise in cold cooked meats and seafoods, which are served with a dazzling array of dips and sauces. They are also known for their delectable stewed goose. They eat raw crabs and clams marinated in garlic, chilli and coriander; soupy rice with shellfish; delicate sweetmeats; and an addictive preserve made from Chinese olives and salted mustard greens. Chiuchow is one of my favourite Chinese regional cuisines.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那个星期我吃了很多很多好吃的，但最棒的还是最后的那顿晚餐：吃得有点晚，地方是在创发潮州饭店，位于九龙区的九龙城。潮州是广东东北部的一个地方，有自己独特的美味菜系，亚洲之外少有人知。九十年代香港人钱多没处花的时候，潮州菜里高级（且高价）的鱼翅海螺等盛行一时。然而，我却觉得这个地区的平民饮食启发性要强得多。潮州人很擅长做冷肉与海鲜，还要配上种类丰富、味道诱人的蘸酱。他们的美味烧鹅也很出名；生螃蟹、生蛤蜊用大蒜、辣椒和香菜腌好了也能做一道菜；汤饭里混上贝壳，其鲜美无与伦比；还有好吃的果脯蜜饯；用中国橄榄与芥菜腌的橄榄菜更是一吃上瘾。总之，潮州菜算是我最钟爱的中国菜系之一了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Unfortunately I only realised that Cheung Fat was going to be the gastronomic highlight of my trip after I had entered the café, and by then I had already eaten one dinner at another Chiuchow restaurant on the Kowloon waterfront. At the first place, I had intended to order modestly, just for a taste, but the food was so good that I had ended up eating rather a lot of sweet-sour e-fu noodles, pigeon casserole, salted radish omelette and green beans with Chinese olive preserve. By the time I reached Cheung Fat, I was already full, and was planning on just having a quick sniff around before going back to my hotel to sleep. But when I saw the crabs hanging in the window and the extraordinarily delicious-looking fare on the tables all around, I realised that this would not be possible. So I tried to impress upon the waiter that neither I nor my Cantonese dining companion was actually hungry, while asking them to give us a kind of tasting menu of all their unmissable specialities.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="遗憾的是，我进了创发的门，才后知后觉地意识到这里将是此次美食之行的最高潮；而在那之前我已经在九龙海边另一家潮州菜馆吃了顿晚饭了。在那家餐馆我本来想少点些菜、只尝尝味道的，但真的太好吃了，结果我又没收住，吃了糖醋伊面、家乡酱焗鸽、菜脯煎蛋和榄菜肉碎四季豆。到创发的时候我已经很饱了，想着就看一眼便回酒店睡觉。但窗上挂着新鲜的螃蟹，周围的桌上摆的菜看着都好好吃，我知道自己之前的打算是不可能了。于是我努力向服务员强调，我和同行的那位香港“饭友”都不饿，请他们推荐几个不可错过的特色菜即可。">查看中文翻译</div>

We ended the meal as we had begun it, by drinking tiny bowlfuls of roasted Iron Buddha tea.

<div class="line_en">After that decadent dinner, I took a taxi back from the run-down ghetto of Kowloon City to the Peninsula Hotel, where I was staying in a four-roomed suite with picture windows overlooking the harbour, a private telescope and its own marble-clad jacuzzi. As always, Hong Kong seemed like a place of almost violent contrasts. There was my own personal seesaw between the pull of China and the longing for home, and between the conflicting desires of my Chinese and English selves; and then there were the contrasts of the place itself, between wealth and poverty, East and West, skyscrapers and street stalls, shrines to the ancient god of wealth and temples to modern mammon. Somehow, I reflected as I lay back in the froth of my jacuzzi, it had been a very typical Hong Kong day.</div>
