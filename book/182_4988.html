<div class="line_en">"This wasn't a garden," said Susan presently. "It was a castle and this must have been the courtyard."</div>

<div class="line_en">"I see what you mean," said Peter. "Yes. That is the remains of a tower. And there is what used to be a flight of steps going up to the top of the walls. And look at those other steps -- the broad, shallow ones -- going up to that doorway. It must have been the door into the great hall."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我明白你的意思了，”彼得说，“对，那是塔楼的废墟，那是楼梯，直通顶层。你们再看这些又宽又浅的台阶，一直通往门廊，那门准是通往大厅去的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“是吗，露？”彼得转过身来，眼睛盯着她，”我也有同样的感觉。这是今天这个奇怪的日子里所发生的最奇怪的事情。我真想知道咱们是在什么地方，到底发生了什么事。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">While they were talking they had crossed the courtyard and gone through the other doorway into what had once been the hall. This was now very like the courtyard, for the roof had long since disappeared and it was merely another space of grass and daisies, except that it was shorter and narrower and the walls were higher. Across the far end there was a kind of terrace about three feet higher than the rest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们一边交谈，一边穿过院子，走进另一个门道。这里曾经是个大厅，可是现在，与外面的院子几乎没什么两样，屋顶早就没有了，只见一片荒草和雏菊丛生的空地，不过比较窄，比较短，墙比院墙高一些。在另一端有个平台，比别处大约高三英尺。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“只可惜没有宴会。”爱德蒙总是很实际，“天色晚了，你们看，影子这么长，而且天气也没那么热了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I wonder, was it really the hall?" said Susan. "What is that terrace kind of thing?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“奇怪，这儿以前真是个大厅吗？”苏珊说，“那平台是做什么用的？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"How it all comes back!" said Lucy. "We could pretend we were in Cair Paravel now. This hall must have been very like the great hall we feasted in."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这一切若能重现，那该多么好哇！”露茜说，“干脆咱们把这儿当作凯尔帕拉维尔。这座大厅和我们过去举行宴会的王宫十分相似。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Why, you silly," said Peter (who had become strangely excited), "don't you see? That was the dais where the High Table was, where the King and the great lords sat. Anyone would think you had forgotten that we ourselves were once Kings and Queens and sat on a dais just like that, in our great hall."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哎，你这傻瓜，”彼得突然莫名其妙地激动起来，“你还看不出来，那是国王和贵族们坐的地方。你是不是忘记了，我们自己就曾经是国王和女王，坐在王宫的高台上，那台子跟这个都差不多的！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Everyone saw the sense of this, and for the next half hour they were busy. The orchard through which they had first come into the ruins turned out not to be a good place for firewood. They tried the other side of the castle, passing out of the hall by a little side door into a maze of stony humps and hollows which must once have been passages and smaller rooms but was now all nettles and wild roses. Beyond this they found a wide gap in the castle wall and stepped through it into a wood of darker and bigger trees where they found dead branches and rotten wood and sticks and dry leaves and fir-cones in plenty. They went to and fro with bundles until they had a good pile on the dais. At the fifth journey they found the well, just outside the hall, hidden in weeds, but clean and fresh and deep when they had cleared these away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大家都意识到这是明智的，便立即行动起来。果园里枯枝并不多，他们只好穿过大厅，从一扇小小的侧门来到城堡的另一端去碰碰运气。这儿像一个迷宫，有许多石堆和空地。他们猜想，以前这些都是连在一起的小房间，可现在早已是杂草丛生，满目荒凉。再往前去，他们看见围墙上有一个大豁口。穿过豁口，来到一个小树林，这儿的树颜色很深，也很高大。在这里他们找到了大量的干枝、朽木、枯叶和冷杉树的球果。他们来回搬运，抱了一捆又一捆，在城堡平台上堆起了好大堆。幸运的是他们还在大厅外面找到了一口井，这口井被埋没在草丛里。他们把井边的杂草清理干净，发现那井水清凉、甘甜，水也很深。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The remains of a stone pavement ran half-way round it. Then the girls went out to pick some more apples and the boys built the fire, on the dais and fairly close to the corner between two walls, which they thought would be the snuggest and warmest place. They had great difficulty in lighting it and used a lot of matches, but they succeeded in the end. Finally, all four sat down with their backs to the wall and their faces to the fire. They tried roasting some of the apples on the ends of sticks. But roast apples are not much good without sugar, and they are too hot to eat with your fingers till they are too cold to be worth eating. So they had to content themselves with raw apples, which, as Edmund said, made one realize that school suppers weren't so bad after all -- "I shouldn't mind a good thick slice of bread and margarine this minute," he added. But the spirit of adventure was rising in them all, and no one really wanted to be back at school.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="随后，女孩子们又跑去摘来一些苹果，两个男孩子则弄好篝火。他们用了好多根火柴，篝火终于燃起来。这时候，他们相信世上简直找不出更舒适温暖的地方了。接着，他们把苹果插在小棍尖儿上，试着烤苹果吃，可是，没有白糖，烤苹果的味道实在谈不上如何美妙。太烫时没法儿用手拿着吃，等你可以用手去拿时，它又凉得一点儿都不好吃了。结果，他们只好吃生苹果充饥。爱德蒙说得不错，学校食堂里的晚餐其实并不那么糟糕——“要是这会儿来一片厚厚的奶油面包，我倒是没什么不乐意。”他加上一句。但是，一股冒险的热情在激动着大家，谁也没有真的就想回学校去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Shortly after the last apple had been eaten, Susan went out to the well to get another drink. When she came back she was carrying something in her hand.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“可是，我说，”爱德蒙不停地眨巴眼睛，“你怎么解释这一切呢？这个地方在很久以前就给毁坏了。看看那些大树，它们沿着大门一直长了上去，再看看这些石头。随便什么人都看得出来，这个地方几百年都没人住过了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

First point: this hall is exactly the same shape and size as the hall at Cair Paravel. Just picture a roof on this, and a coloured pavement instead of grass, and tapestries on the walls, and you get our royal banqueting hall."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我想过了，”彼得说，“问题就在这里，我们先把这个搁在一边，我想把我的根据一条条地摆出来。首先，这个大厅的形状和大小与凯尔帕拉维尔的那个完全一样。你们只要想象一下，上方是个穹顶，再把那些草地改成彩色的路面，墙上挂起壁毯。好了，现在咱们已经在宫廷宴会大厅里了。是不是？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Fourth point. Don't you remember -- it was the very day before the ambassadors came from the King of Calormen don't you remember planting the orchard outside the north gate of Cair Paravel? The greatest of all the wood-people, Pomona herself, came to put good spells on it. It was those very decent little chaps the moles who did the actual digging.

And by Jove he was right."</div>

<div class="line_en">"We must," said Peter. "Cheer up, Susan. It's no good behaving like kids now that we are back in Narnia. You're a Queen here. And anyway no one could go to sleep with a mystery like this on their minds."</div>

<div class="line_en">They tried to use long sticks as torches but this was not a success. If you held them with the lighted end up they went out, and if you held them the other way they scorched your hand and the smoke got in your eyes. In the end they had to use Edmund's electric torch; luckily it had been a birthday present less than a week ago and the battery was almost new. He went first, with the light. Then came Lucy, then Susan, and Peter brought up the rear.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们用树枝燃起火把照亮，但这办法不行。燃烧的那一头朝上的话，火就会熄灭；换一头的话，火苗就会灼痛手，烟会熏着眼睛。最后他们不得不用爱德蒙的电筒。幸好一个礼拜前爱德蒙生日时得到一只电筒，电池几乎还是新的。他拿着电筒第一个走了下去，接着是露茜和苏珊，彼得走在最后。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For now all knew that it was indeed the ancient treasure chamber of Cair Paravel where they had once reigned as Kings and Queens of Narnia. There was a kind of path up the middle (as it might be in a greenhouse), and along each side at intervals stood rich suits of armour, like knights guarding the treasures. In between the suits of armour, and on each side of the path, were shelves covered with precious things -- necklaces and arm rings and finger rings and golden bowls and dishes and long tusks of ivory, brooches and coronets and chains of gold, and heaps of unset stones lying piled anyhow as if they were marbles or potatoes -- diamonds, rubies, carbuncles, emeralds, topazes, and amethysts. Under the shelves stood great chests of oak strengthened with iron bars and heavily padlocked. And it was bitterly cold, and so still that they could hear themselves breathing, and the treasures were so covered with dust that unless they had realized where they were and remembered most of the things, they would hardly have known they were treasures. There was something sad and a little frightening about the place, because it all seemed so forsaken and long ago. That was why nobody said anything for at least a minute.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在无可怀疑了，这儿就是凯尔帕拉维尔那古老的宝库。作为纳尼亚的国王和女王，他们曾是这里的主人。房子正中有一条甬道（就像暖房里一样），两边每隔不远就竖立着一套辉煌的盔甲，犹如卫士在守护着那些宝藏。在南道两旁的架子上，盔甲之间，摆满了奇珍异宝——项链、手镯、戒指以及纯金餐具和长长的象牙，还有成堆尚未镶嵌的宝石，像石子或者土豆一样散乱地堆在那里——钻石、红宝石、绿宝石、红玉、黄玉，还有紫水晶。架子下面放着一个个钢片镶边的栎木箱子，上着大锁。这里冷得要命，又静得出奇，孩子们几乎能听得见自己的心跳。那些宝贝上面盖着厚厚的尘土，要不是他们都知道这是什么地方，并且又回想起过去所发生的一切，他们简直无法相信那些是珠宝。渐渐地孩子们由新奇而产生的兴奋消失了，取而代之的是一丝伤感与惆怅，甚至有些恐怖，因为这里完全像是一个很久很久以前就被遗弃的地方。因此足足有几分钟，谁也没有讲话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Then it really must be Cair Paravel," said Lucy. "There were sixteen." Nothing more was said till all four were standing in a knot together at the foot of the stairway. Then Edmund flashed his torch slowly round.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then, of course, they began walking about and picking things up to look at. It was like meeting very old friends. If you had been there you would have heard them saying things like, "Oh look! Our coronation rings -- do you remember first wearing this? -- Why, this is the little brooch we all thought was lost -- I say, isn't that the armour you wore in the great tournament in the Lone Islands? -- do you remember the dwarf making that for me? -- do you remember drinking out of that horn? -- do you remember, do you remember?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"We must take the gifts," said Peter. For long ago at a Christmas in Narnia he and Susan and Lucy had been given certain presents which they valued more than their whole kingdom. Edmund had had no gift, because he was not with them at the time. (This was his own fault, and you can read about it in the other book.)</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们首先得拿上那些礼物。”彼得说。很久很久以前，在一个纳尼亚的圣诞夜，他、苏珊和露茜都得了一些礼物，他们把这些礼物看得比整个王国都珍贵。爱德蒙没有礼物，因为当时他没有和大家在一起。（这是他自己的过错，你在另一个故事里可以读到。）">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But suddenly Edmund said, "Look here. We mustn't waste the battery: goodness knows how often we shall need it. Hadn't we better take what we want and get out again?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然，爱德蒙停住了脚步“听我说，不能再浪费电池了，也许以后会更需要它。咱们是不是拿上需要的东西，然后赶紧出去？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They all agreed with Peter and walked up the path to the wall at the far end of the treasure chamber, and there, sure enough, the gifts were still hanging. Lucy's was the smallest for it was only a little bottle. But the bottle was made of diamond instead of glass, and it was still more than half full of the magical cordial which would heal almost every wound and every illness. Lucy said nothing and looked very solemn as she took her gift down from its place and slung the belt over her shoulder and once more felt the bottle at her side where it used to hang in the old days. Susan's gift had been a bow and arrows and a horn. The bow was still there, and the ivory quiver, full of wellfeathered arrows, but -- "Oh, Susan," said Lucy. "Where's the horn?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大家都同意彼得的话，于是顺着甬道径直朝宝库的另一端走去。不出所料，那些东西依然挂在墙上。露茜的礼物最小了，是一个宝石小瓶子，里面还剩有半瓶多神水：这神水可以瞬间治愈所有的创伤和疾病。露茜十分庄重地、默默地把它从墙上取下来，用背带斜持在肩上。苏珊的礼物是一张弓、一壶箭和一只号。那张弓依然完好无损，旁边是那只盛满了羽翎箭的象牙箭壶。可是，号却不在。“喂！苏珊，”露茜问，“你的号在哪里？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh bother, bother, bother," said Susan after she had thought for a moment. "I remember now. I took it with me the last day of all, the day we went hunting the White Stag. It must have got lost when we blundered back into that other place -- England, I mean."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Never mind," said Susan, "I've still got the bow." And she took it.</div>

<div class="line_en">But whether by some magic in the air of the treasure chamber or not, the bow was still in working order. Archery and swimming were the things Susan was good at. In a moment she had bent the bow and then she gave one little pluck to the string. It twanged: a chirruping twang that vibrated through the whole room. And that one small noise brought back the old days to the children's minds more than anything that had happened yet. All the battles and hunts and feasts came rushing into their heads together.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可能是宝库里的空气有些奇异之处，那张弓仍然很好用。苏珊在学校里是射箭和游泳的好手，她立即拉开弓，轻轻弹了一下弓弦。嗡的一声。弓弦那震撼人心的声响，在整个屋子里回荡。这轻轻的响声，把孩子们带回往日那美好的时光。战斗、持猎、欢宴……一幕一幕又都浮现在他们的脑海之中。">查看中文翻译</div>
