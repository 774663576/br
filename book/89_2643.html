<div class="line_en">The rat has gone home. Britt-Marie has locked the door and washed up and cleaned the whole recreation center one more time. She is standing by the window looking out at the world. From time to time, the ball bounces through the puddles onto the road, and then the children play Rock, Paper, Scissors to decide who has to go and fetch it.</div>

<div class="line_en">Kent used to tell David and Pernilla when they were small that Britt-Marie couldn't play with them because she "didn't know how," but that isn't true. Britt-Marie knows perfectly well how to play Rock, Paper, Scissors. She just doesn't think it sounds very hygienic to keep stones in paper bags. As for the scissors, it's not even worth thinking about. Who knows where they've been?</div>

<div class="line_en">Everything begins in earnest this evening. The weather is mild, the snow turns to rain as it falls from sky to earth. The children play soccer in the dark, but neither the dark nor the rain seems to concern them in the least. The parking area is only blessed with light here and there, where it's cast by the neon sign of the pizzeria, or from the kitchen window where Britt-Marie stands hidden behind the curtain watching them, but, to be quite honest, most of them are so bad at soccer that more light would only have a marginal effect on their ability to hit the ball.</div>

<div class="line_en">The two siblings, Vega and Omar, play on opposing sides. She is calm and calculating, gently moving the ball with the insides of her feet, as you might twiddle your toes against someone you love while sleeping. Her brother, on the other hand, is angry and frustrated, hunting the ball down as if it owes him money. Britt-Marie doesn't know the first thing about soccer, but anyone can see that Vega is the best player in the parking area. Or at least the least bad one.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="薇卡和奥马尔姐弟俩踢球时，薇卡比较冷静，精于算计，用脚的内侧轻轻拨球，就像你熟睡时无意识地在你家另一口子身上蹭脚指头那样。她弟弟却爱耍脾气，患得患失，紧追着球不放，好像足球欠了他一屁股债。连布里特—玛丽这种对足球一窍不通的人都看得出来，薇卡是停车场上最棒的球员，至少不会是最挫的那个。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Of course Kent is always saying Britt-Marie is "so darned negative." It's a part of her social incompetence. "Darn it! Just be happy instead!" Kent fetches the cigars and takes care of the guests and Britt-Marie does the washing-up and takes care of the home, and that's how they have divided up their lives. Kent is a bit happy, darn it, and Britt-Marie is darned negative. Maybe that's how it goes. It's easier to stay optimistic if you never have to clear up the mess afterwards.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当然，肯特总说布里特—玛丽“消极得要死”，这是她缺乏社交能力的旁证。“该死！你为什么就是不能开心点儿？”肯特拿出雪茄分给客人，布里特—玛丽打扫卫生、收拾家务，日子就是这么过的，肯特还算有点儿快活劲儿，布里特—玛丽总是臭着一张脸。也许生活就是这样，要是你每次都负责打扫别人留下的狼藉，恐怕很难高兴起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ingrid, of course, was always falling to bits with wanting things -- her singing career, for instance, and the celebrity status she was predestined to achieve, and the boys out there in the world who were so much more than the usual ones on offer in their apartment block. The usual boys who, Britt-Marie realized, were infinitely too unusual to even look at Britt-Marie and yet far too usual in every way to deserve her sister.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="英格丽德当然总是渴望得到各种大大小小的东西——比方说她想当歌手，认为自己命中注定会出名，所以邻居家的男孩太普通，配不上她。布里特—玛丽却觉得，邻居家的那些男孩太不普通，以至于看都不看她一眼，而对姐姐来说，他们又太普通，哪方面都配不上她。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ingrid was never negative. As always with people like this, it's difficult to know whether everyone loved Ingrid because she was so positive, or if she was so positive because everyone loved her. She was one year older than Britt-Marie and five inches taller -- it doesn't take much to put someone in your shadow. It never mattered to Britt-Marie that she was the one who receded into the background. She never wanted much.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="英格丽德就从不消极。这种人有个特点，你很难知道是不是每个人都喜欢她，因为她太积极，但也许积极的原因恰恰是每个人都喜欢她。英格丽德比布里特—玛丽大一岁，身高也比她多出五英寸——当然，要想压过妹妹的风头，不用高出这么多就能做到。布里特—玛丽已经习惯了给姐姐当背景，从来没有过非分之想。">查看中文翻译</div>

It never bothered Ingrid. Quite the opposite.

<div class="line_en">Vega is grim, but when her team scores in the dark yard, in the rain, in a goal made of two soft-drink cans, her laugh sounds just like Ingrid's. Ingrid also loved to play. As with all people like that, it's difficult to know if she was the best because she loved the games, or if she loved them because she was the best.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="薇卡性格严肃，可当她的球队冒着雨，在黑暗的院子里把球踢进两只饮料瓶组成的球门里时，她的笑声听上去竟很像英格丽德。英格丽德也喜欢玩。和所有爱玩的人一样，很难弄清她究竟因为爱游戏才擅长游戏，还是因为擅长游戏才爱游戏。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A little boy with ginger hair gets hit hard in the face with the ball. He falls headlong into a muddy puddle. Britt-Marie shudders. It's the same soccer ball they shot at Britt-Marie's head, and when she sees the mud on it she wants to give herself a tetanus shot.

<div class="line_en">Of course, if Kent had been here he would have said the children were playing like big girls' blouses. Kent is able to describe almost anything bad by adding, before or after, that it's a bit of a "big girl's blouse." Britt-Marie is actually not especially fond of irony, but she notes a certain amount of that very thing in the fact that the only player out there not playing like a girl's blouse is the girl.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当然，如果肯特在这里，他会说这些小孩踢起球来太娘们儿了。肯特就是有这个本事，能用“太娘们儿了”五个字来形容所有的糟糕事。布里特—玛丽其实不是特别喜欢反讽，但她敏锐地注意到，眼前的比赛中，踢得最不娘们儿的那个恰恰是个小女孩儿。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Britt-Marie finally comes to her senses and leaves the window before anyone out there starts getting any ideas. It's past eight, so the recreation center is steeped in darkness. Britt-Marie waters her balcony boxes in the dark. Sprinkles baking soda over the soil. She misses her balcony more than anything. You're never quite alone when you can stand on a balcony -- you have all the cars and houses and the people in the streets. You're among them, but also not. That's the best thing about balconies. The second best is standing out there early in the morning before Kent has woken up, closing your eyes and feeling the wind in your hair. Britt-Marie used to do that, and it felt like Paris. Of course she has never been to Paris, because Kent doesn't do any business there, but she has solved an awful lot of crossword clues about Paris. It's the world's most crossword-referenced city, full of rich and famous celebrities with their very own cleaners. Ingrid used to go on about how they'd have their own servants, which was the only bit of the dream Britt-Marie wasn't sure about -- she didn't want them to think that Britt-Marie's sister was so bad at cleaning that she had to employ someone to do it. Britt-Marie had heard their mother talking about those sorts of mothers with contempt, and Britt-Marie didn't want anyone talking about Ingrid like that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布里特—玛丽终于恢复了理智，不再犯傻似的盯着外面，在别人发现她之前离开了窗口。已经晚上八点多了，娱乐中心沉浸在黑暗中，布里特—玛丽摸黑给她的花盆浇了水，往土里撒了小苏打，越发思念起她的阳台来。即便一个人站在阳台上，也不算彻底的孤单，街上那么多汽车、房子和人都陪着你，你既属于他们，又不属于他们，这就是阳台最大的妙处。第二个妙处在于，她可以一大早（肯特起床以前）就站在阳台上，闭上眼睛，感受风从发间穿过。布里特—玛丽经常这样做，感觉就像在巴黎。当然她从没去过巴黎，因为肯特不和那边做生意，但她解决过许多关于巴黎的填字游戏，它是世界上跟填字游戏最有缘分的城市，住着各种有钱的名人，他们都有自己的清洁工。英格丽德喜欢喋喋不休地谈论她们到了巴黎会有多少仆人，只有这点布里特—玛丽不太同意——她不想让人觉得自己的姐姐不擅长打扫，以至于到了请别人帮忙打扫的程度。布里特—玛丽的母亲就曾经用蔑视的口气谈论这样的女人，所以她不希望别人也这样谈论英格丽德。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So while Ingrid would excel at everything out there in the world, Britt-Marie imagined herself being really good at things inside of it. Cleaning. Making things nice. Her sister noticed this. Noticed her. Britt-Marie did her hair every morning, and her sister never forgot to say, "Thanks, you did that really well, Britt!" while she turned her head in front of the mirror to a tune from one of her vinyl records. Britt-Marie never had records. You don't need any when you have an older sister who truly sees you.</div>

<div class="line_en">Britt-Marie stands inside the door, breathing in the smell of wet potting soil and baking soda. She remembers the smell of alcohol and the sound of Kent's soccer matches. He never went onto the balcony, so the balcony belonged to Britt-Marie and no one else, which was something quite unique. She always lied and said she had bought the plants, because she knew he'd say something horrible if she told him she'd found them in the garbage room and sometimes in the street, left behind by some neighbors when they moved away. Plants reminded her of Ingrid, because Ingrid loved things that were alive. And for this reason Britt-Marie repeatedly saved homeless plants, to give her the strength to remember a sister whose life she was not even able to save once. You couldn't explain things like this to Kent.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布里特—玛丽站在门里，呼吸着湿漉漉的花土和小苏打的气味，想起肯特看球赛时总是酒气熏天、吵吵嚷嚷，但他从来不到阳台上去，所以阳台只属于布里特—玛丽，对她来说是个非常独特的处所。至于她的那些花，她都谎称是自己买的，因为她知道，如果照实告诉肯特它们是从垃圾房或者街上捡来的（邻居搬家时丢掉不要了），他一定会说些非常难听的话。花花草草让她想起英格丽德，英格丽德喜欢有生命的东西，就因为这个，布里特—玛丽日复一日地拯救无家可归的植物，以此纪念她没有能力拯救的姐姐。只有这样做，她才能鼓起勇气想起英格丽德。你是没法和肯特解释这样的事的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Kent doesn't believe in death, he believes in evolution. "That's evolution," he said, nodding approvingly, on one occasion when he was watching a nature program in which a lion killed an injured zebra: "It's sorting out the one that's weak, right? It's about the survival of the species, you have to get that. If you're not the best from the start, you have to accept the consequences and leave space for someone stronger, right?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="肯特不相信死亡，他相信进化。“那是进化。”有次电视上播出一档自然节目，看到一头狮子咬死了一匹受伤的斑马时，他点头赞许道，“就该这么对待弱者，不是吗？只有这样，物种才能延续下去，如果你不是最好的，就得接受自然规律，给强者让地方，对不对？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The girl at the other end of the line groans in what is, to be honest, quite an uncalled-for way.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="女孩在电话那头呻吟了一声，好像撞到了什么地方。老实说，这一声听起来很矫情，似乎故意想让布里特—玛丽听见。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The policeman looks ambivalent. The woman who stands in front of him is very different to the one the children described. Fussy, yes, and bossy, clearly, but something else as well. Determined, immaculately neat, and somehow… unique. He stares dumbly for a moment while he tries to think of something to say to her, but in the end decides the most civic thing he can do is to hold out a big glass jar towards Britt-Marie.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="警察看起来进退两难，眼前的这个女人和孩子们说的不一样。没错，她确实既挑剔又霸道，可也有点儿别的什么，比方说坚决、爱干净，还有种莫名其妙的…独特。他傻呵呵地盯着布里特—玛丽研究了一会儿，想对她说点什么，但最后觉得还是采取最文明的手段比较保险。于是，警察拿出一只大玻璃罐子，递给布里特—玛丽。">查看中文翻译</div>
