<div class="line_en">The children open the door at half-time to let Britt-Marie and Pirate back in. Britt-Marie spends the second half in front of the mirror in the bathroom. Firstly because she doesn't want to come out and risk having to talk to any of the children, and secondly because their team scores again so they forbid her from coming out until the match is over. So Britt-Marie stays in there and dries her hair and brings them luck and has a life crisis. It's possible to do all of these things at the same time. Her mirror image belongs to someone else, someone whose face has been touched by many winters. The winters have always been the worst, both for the balcony plants and for Britt-Marie. It's the silence that Britt-Marie struggles most of all to live with, because while immersed in silence you don't know if anyone knows you are there, and winter is also the quiet season because the cold insulates people. Makes the world soundless.</div>

<div class="line_en">Her father started coming home later and later from his work, and at a certain point he started to come home so late that Britt-Marie would already be asleep by the time he walked in. Then she woke up one morning and he was only just coming home. And in the end she woke up one morning and he hadn't come home at all. Her mother said less and less about it. Stayed in bed for longer and longer in the mornings. Britt-Marie meandered around the flat as children do when they have to live in silent worlds. Once she knocked over a vase just so her mother would yell at her from the bedroom. Her mother didn't yell. Britt-Marie swept up the glass herself. And never knocked over a vase again. The next day her mother stayed in bed until Britt-Marie had made dinner. The day after that she got up even later. And in the end she didn't get up at all. Of course several of her mother's girlfriends sent beautiful flowers and condolences, but they were too busy with their lives to pay their respects to someone who was already dead anyway. Britt-Marie cut little notches in the flower stalks and put them in newly washed vases. She cleaned the flat and polished all the windows and the day after, when she took out the rubbish, she met Kent on the stairs. They stared at each other as children who have turned into adults tend to do. He had been married with two children, but he had recently been divorced and had now come back to the house to visit his mother. He smiled when he saw Britt-Marie. Because in those days he used to see her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她父亲回家越来越晚，布里特—玛丽睡觉前根本见不着他。有天早晨她都起床了，父亲才走进家门。后来她早晨起床时，父亲基本上还在外面。对于这件事，她母亲开始还数落两句，后来就不作声了，因为自己起床的时间也越来越晚。布里特—玛丽只好在房子里瞎逛，像那些生活在无声世界里的孩子们一样。有一次，她不小心撞倒一只花瓶，以为卧室里的母亲会朝她大喊大叫，可她根本没有。布里特—玛丽默默清理了碎片，再也没撞倒任何花瓶。第二天，她母亲一直待在卧室，直到布里特—玛丽做好晚饭才出来。第三天，她出来的时间更晚，最后干脆一天都不下床。她母亲的几个女性朋友也带着鲜花来看过她，但她们毕竟还要忙活人的事，没工夫经常过来陪她怀念一个死人。布里特—玛丽在花茎上刻了一些小凹槽，放进刷干净的花瓶里，然后清扫公寓，擦洗所有的窗户，直到有一天出门扔垃圾的时候，她在楼梯上遇到了肯特。两人大眼瞪小眼，像一对乳臭未干的半大孩子。那时肯特刚刚离婚，有两个孩子，回家探望他母亲。见到布里特—玛丽时，他微微笑了笑，因为那些日子里，他时常看到她。">查看中文翻译</div>
