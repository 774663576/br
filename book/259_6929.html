<div class="line_en">The "Nightline" crew came back for its third and final visit. The whole tenor of the thing was different now. Less like an interview, more like a sad farewell. Ted Koppel had called several times before coming up, and he had asked Morrie, "Do you think you can handle it?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Morrie wasn't sure he could. "I'm tired all the time now, Ted. And I'm choking a lot. If I can't say something, will you say it for me?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Koppel said sure. And then the normally stoic anchor added this: "If you don't want to do it, Morrie, it's okay. I'll come up and say good-bye anyhow."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title='科佩尔说行。接着这位处事一向冷峻的主持人再次说，"如果你不想进行这次采访，莫里，没关系，我可以对着镜头跟观众说再见。"'>查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Later, Morrie would grin mischievously and say, "I'm getting to him." And he was.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title='后来，莫里颇感得意地说，"他被我感化了。"的确如此。'>查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Unlike the previous two Koppel-Schwartz sessions, this one was conducted entirely within Morrie's study, where Morrie had become a prisoner of his chair. Koppel, who kissed my old professor when he first saw him, now had to squeeze in alongside the bookcase in order to be seen in the camera's lens.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="和前两次的科佩尔－施瓦茨会晤不同，这一次自始至终是在莫里的书房里进行的，莫里已经成了那张躺椅的囚徒。科佩尔一见到莫里先吻了他，然后侧身从书橱前挤到了镜头里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Koppel now referred to Morrie as "a friend." My old professor had even coaxed compassion out of the television business.</div>

<div class="line_en">For the interview, which took place on a Friday afternoon, Morrie wore the same shirt he'd had on the day before. He changed shirts only every other day at this point, and this was not the other day, so why break routine?</div>

<div class="line_en">Koppel had his answer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="科佩尔有了答案。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The camera rolled, the third and final interview. Koppel asked if Morrie was more afraid now that death was near. Morrie said no; to tell the truth, he was less afraid. He said he was letting go of some of the outside world, not having the newspaper read to him as much, not paying as much attention to mail, instead listening more to music and watching the leaves change color through his window.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="摄像机转动起来，第三次。也是最后一次的采访开始了。科佩尔问莫里他对死神的临近是不是感到更害怕了。莫里说没有。事实上，他反而不怎么怕了。他说他正在远离外面的世界，不再像以前那么多地听人读报，也不太关心来往的信件，更多时候是听听音乐，看窗外的树叶渐渐地变换颜色。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Before they started, Koppel asked about the disease's progression. "How bad is it, Morrie?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title='正式采访开始前，科佩尔询问了疾病的进展情况。"变得有多糟，莫里？"'>查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Morrie weakly lifted a hand, halfway up his belly. This was as far as he could go.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莫里无力地抬抬手，连腹部也没超过。他只能抬到这儿。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There were other people who suffered from ALS, Morrie knew, some of them famous, such as Stephen Hawking, the brilliant physicist and author of A Brief History of Time. He lived with a hole in his throat, spoke through a computer synthesizer, typed words by batting his eyes as a sensor picked up the movement.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莫里知道还有其他的人也遭受着 ALS 的折磨，有些还是名人，比如说斯蒂芬·霍金，这位才华横溢的物理学家和《时间简史》的作者。他的喉咙开了个洞，说话要靠一只电脑合成器的帮助，笔录靠一台传感器根据他眨眼睛的变化来作出判断。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This was admirable, but it was not the way Morrie wanted to live. He told Koppel he knew when it would be time to say good-bye.</div>

<div class="line_en">"For me, Ted, living means I can be responsive to the other person. It means I can show my emotions and my feelings. Talk to them. Feel with them …"</div>

<div class="line_cn" title='他呼了口气。 "当这种能力消失时，莫里也消失了。"'>查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He told Koppel he wanted to die with serenity. He shared his latest aphorism: "Don't let go too soon, but don't hang on too long."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title='他对科佩尔说他想安宁地死去。他当众发表了他最新的格言："别走得太快，但也别拖得太久。"'>查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Koppel nodded painfully. Only six months had passed between the first "Nightline" show and this one, but Morrie Schwartz was clearly a collapsed form. He had decayed before a national TV audience, a miniseries of a death. But as his body rotted, his character shone even more brightly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title='科佩尔心酸地点点头。第一次"夜线"节目播出至今才过去了六个月，但莫里·施瓦茨显然已经垮了。他当着全国电视观众的面在衰竭， 如同一部死亡的连续短片。然而，尽管他的躯体在腐朽，他的人格精神却更加光彩夺目。'>查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Toward the end of the interview, the camera zoomed in on Morrie-Koppel was not even in the picture, only his voice was heard from outside it -- and the anchor asked if my old professor had anything he wanted to say to the millions of people he had touched. Although he did not mean it this way, I couldn't help but think of a condemned man being asked for his final words.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在采访即将结束时，摄像机的镜头拉出了莫里的特写——甚至连科佩尔也不在镜头内，只传出他的画外音——主持人问我的老教授还有没有话要对成千上万被他感动的观众说。我不禁想到了死囚临刑前人们也会这么问，当然，科佩尔并没有联想到这个。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They talked like friends. As he had in the previous two interviews, Koppel asked about the "old ass wipe test" -- hoping, perhaps, for a humorous response. But Morrie was too tired even to grin. He shook his head. "When I sit on the commode, I can no longer sit up straight. I'm listing all the time, so they have to hold me. When I'm done they have to wipe me. That is how far it's gotten."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title='他们像老朋友一样交谈着。因为前两次采访中都提起过，科佩尔这次又提了"擦洗屁股 "的老话题——也许想得到对方一个诙谐幽默的反应。但莫里累得连笑都很困难。他摇摇头。" 当我坐在便桶上时，我怎么也坐不直身子。我老是往前倾，所以他们得扶住我，完事后他们还得替我擦洗，眼下已经到了这个地步了。"'>查看中文翻译</div>
