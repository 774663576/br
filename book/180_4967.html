<div class="line_en">She had gone one day into a Hall and heard him speaking during the war. He was denouncing something: he was condemning somebody. He was preaching brotherly love. And all she felt was how could he love his kind who did not know one picture from another, who had stood behind her smoking shag ("fivepence an ounce, Miss Briscoe") and making it his business to tell her women can't write, women can't paint, not so much that he believed it, as that for some odd reason he wished it? There he was lean and red and raucous, preaching love from a platform (there were ants crawling about among the plantains which she disturbed with her brush -- red, energetic, shiny ants, rather like Charles Tansley). She had looked at him ironically from her seat in the half-empty hall, pumping love into that chilly space, and suddenly, there was the old cask or whatever it was bobbing up and down among the waves and Mrs Ramsay looking for her spectacle case among the pebbles. "Oh, dear! What a nuisance! Lost again. Don't bother, Mr Tansley. I lose thousands every summer," at which he pressed his chin back against his collar, as if afraid to sanction such exaggeration, but could stand it in her whom he liked, and smiled very charmingly. He must have confided in her on one of those long expeditions when people got separated and walked back alone. He was educating his little sister, Mrs Ramsay had told her. It was immensely to his credit. Her own idea of him was grotesque, Lily knew well, stirring the plantains with her brush. Half one's notions of other people were, after all, grotesque. They served private purposes of one's own. He did for her instead of a whipping-boy. She found herself flagellating his lean flanks when she was out of temper. If she wanted to be serious about him she had to help herself to Mrs Ramsay's sayings, to look at him through her eyes.</div>

<div class="line_en">One wanted fifty pairs of eyes to see with, she reflected. Fifty pairs of eyes were not enough to get round that one woman with, she thought. Among them, must be one that was stone blind to her beauty. One wanted most some secret sense, fine as air, with which to steal through keyholes and surround her where she sat knitting, talking, sitting silent in the window alone; which took to itself and treasured up like the air which held the smoke of the steamer, her thoughts, her imaginations, her desires. What did the hedge mean to her, what did the garden mean to her, what did it mean to her when a wave broke? (Lily looked up, as she had seen Mrs Ramsay look up; she too heard a wave falling on the beach.) And then what stirred and trembled in her mind when the children cried, "How's that? How's that?" cricketing? She would stop knitting for a second. She would look intent. Then she would lapse again, and suddenly Mr Ramsay stopped dead in his pacing in front of her and some curious shock passed through her and seemed to rock her in profound agitation on its breast when stopping there he stood over her and looked down at her. Lily could see him.</div>

<div class="line_en">He stretched out his hand and raised her from her chair. It seemed somehow as if he had done it before; as if he had once bent in the same way and raised her from a boat which, lying a few inches off some island, had required that the ladies should thus be helped on shore by the gentlemen. An old-fashioned nearly, crinolines and peg-top trousers. Letting herself be helped by him, Mrs Ramsay had thought (Lily supposed) the time has come now. Yes, she would say it now. Yes, she would marry him. And she stepped slowly, quietly on shore. Probably she said one word only, letting her hand rest still in his. I will marry you, she might have said, with her hand in his; but no more. Time after time the same thrill had passed between them -- obviously it had, Lily thought, smoothing a way for her ants. She was not inventing; she was only trying to smooth out something she had been given years ago folded up; something she had seen. For in the rough and tumble of daily life, with all those children about, all those visitors, one had constantly a sense of repetition -- of one thing falling where another had fallen, and so setting up an echo which chimed in the air and made it full of vibrations.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他伸出手，把她从椅子里扶起。不知怎地，好像他以前也这样做过；好像有一次他也是这样弯下身子，把她从船里扶出来，那条船停靠在某个小岛边，离岸有几英寸，需要绅士们这样把女士们扶上岸。那是一幕老式的情景，几乎应该出现用衬架支撑的女裙和上宽下窄的陀螺形裤子。拉姆齐夫人听任他扶自己上岸时心里想（这是莉莉的推测），现在时候到了；是的，现在她要说出来了。是的，她愿意嫁给他。她从容地默默地上了岸。也许她只说了一个字，让自己的手仍握在他的手里。我愿意嫁给你，她可能这样说，手仍在他的手里；但仅此而已。他们之间一次又一次地产生过同样的激情——显然是这样，莉莉想，一面给她的蚂蚁平出一条路来。她并没有凭空捏造，她只不过是在展平人家多年前折叠起来给她的一件东西；一件她看见过的东西。因为在乱糟糟的日常生活中，周围老有那么多的孩子，那么多的客人，你不断有一种事物在重复的感觉——感到一件东西落在另一件东西已经落下之处，因而激起了回声，在空中振荡、回响。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But it tired Mrs Ramsay, it cowed her a little -- the plates whizzing and the doors slamming. And there would fall between them sometimes long rigid Lily in her, half plaintive, half resentful, she seemed unable to surmount the tempest calmly, or to laugh as they laughed, but in her weariness perhaps concealed something. She brooded and sat silent. After a time he would hang stealthily about the places where she was -- roaming under the window where she sat writing letters or talking, for she would take care to be busy when he passed, and evade him, and pretend not to see him. Then he would turn smooth as silk, affable, urbane, and try to win her so. Still she would hold off, and now she would assert for a brief season some of those prides and airs the due of her beauty which she was generally utterly without; would turn her head; would look so, over her shoulder, always with some Minta, Paul, or William Bankes at her side. At length, standing outside the group the very figure of a famished wolfhound (Lily got up off the grass and stood looking at the steps, at the window, where she had seen him), he would say her name, once only, for all the world like a wolf barking in the snow, but still she held back; and he would say it once more, and this time something in the tone would rouse her, and she would go to him, leaving them all of a sudden, and they would walk off together among the pear trees, the cabbages, and the raspberry beds. They would have it out together. But with what attitudes and with what words? Such a dignity was theirs in this relationship that, turning away, she and Paul and Minta would hide their curiosity and their discomfort, and begin picking flowers, throwing balls, chattering, until it was time for dinner, and there they were, he at one end of the table, she at the other, as usual.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是这使拉姆齐夫人厌倦，也使她有点害怕——盘子嗖嗖飞出窗外和门的砰砰撞击。有时他们之间会出现长时间的僵持的沉默，这时她处于半哀怨半愤恨的心情之中，这使莉莉心里很不痛快。拉姆齐夫人此时似乎无法冷静地战胜风暴，或和他们一样一笑置之；但是她的厌倦之中也许掩藏着什么。她坐在那里沉思，过了一阵他就会偷偷在她附近逗留——在她坐着写信或聊天的窗前溜达，因为当他走过时她总会故意显得很忙，躲开他，装作没有看见他。然后他会变得柔如丝绸、和蔼可亲、温文尔雅，力图以此来赢得她的好感。而她仍不容他接近，并且在一小段时间里表现出和她的美貌相符的傲气和矜持，实际上她根本不是个骄傲的人；她会掉转头去；看着身后总是在她周围的明塔、保罗、或者威廉·班克斯。最后，站在这群人外面的饥饿的狼狗般的身影（莉莉从草地上站起身来，看着台阶、窗户，她曾在那里看到他），他会呼唤她的名字，只叫一次，活像一条在雪地里嚎叫的狼，但她依旧矜持，不容接近；然后他会再叫一次，而这次他声调中有什么东西唤醒了她，她便会向他走去，突然把他们大家都撇在一边，他们俩人便会一起走开去，在梨树间、卷心菜和木莓畦间漫步。他们会一起把事情讲个明白。但是，以什么态度，什么语言？在他们的关系中存在着这样的尊严，使她、保罗和明塔转过身子，掩盖起他们的好奇和不自在的感觉，开始摘花、扔球、聊天，直到吃晚饭的时候，他们俩人又和平常一样，他坐在桌子的一头，她在另一头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But it would be a mistake, she thought, thinking how they walked off together, arm in arm, past the greenhouse, to simplify their relationship. It was no monotony of bliss -- she with her impulses and quicknesses; he with his shudders and glooms. Oh, no. The bedroom door would slam violently early in the morning. He would start from the table in a temper. He would whizz his plate through the window. Then all through the house there would be a sense of doors slamming and blinds fluttering, as if a gusty wind were blowing and people scudded about trying in a hasty way to fasten hatches and make things ship- shape. She had met Paul Rayley like that one day on the stairs. It had been an earwig, apparently. Other people might find centipedes. They had laughed and laughed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，她想，把他们的关系这样简单化地看待可能是个错误，她想到他们怎样挽着手走过温室，她披着绿披巾，他的领带飞舞着。他们的关系决不是单调的幸福狂喜——她冲动性急，他易怒忧郁。啊，不是的。卧室的门会在清晨被摔得砰砰响。他会怒冲冲地从桌旁跳起。他会飕的一声把盘子从窗口扔出去。于是整幢房子里就会充满砰砰的开关门声和百叶窗的拍打声，像是一阵狂风袭来，人们跑来跑去急急忙忙想关紧门窗，使一切变得井然有序。有一天她在楼梯上碰见保罗·雷勒时就是这样。他们在那里像两个孩子般笑了又笑，那次的混乱仅仅是因为拉姆齐先生早餐时在牛奶里发现了一条土蚣，连杯子带牛奶整个扔出，飞到了外面平台上，“一条土蚣，”保罗畏惧地喃喃道，“在他的牛奶里。”别的人可能会发现牛奶里有蜈蚣。但他在自己周围建立起了这样一道神圣不可侵犯的篱笆，以这样一种无比威严的派头占领着里面的空间，以至一只在他的牛奶里的土蚣也成了怪物。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Why don't some of you take up botany?… With all those legs and arms why doesn't one of you…?" So they would talk as usual, laughing, for some quiver, as of a blade in the air, which came and went between them as if the usual sight of the children sitting round their soup plates had freshened itself in their eyes after that hour among the pears and the cabbages. Especially, Lily thought, Mrs Ramsay would glance at Prue. She sat in the middle between brothers and sisters, always occupied, it seemed, seeing that nothing went wrong so that she scarcely spoke herself. How Prue must have blamed herself for that earwig in the milk How white she had gone when Mr Ramsay threw his plate through the window! How she drooped under those long silences between them! Anyhow, her mother now would seem to be making it up to her; assuring her that everything was well; promising her that one of these days that same happiness would be hers. She had enjoyed it for less than a year, however.</div>

<div class="line_en">Suddenly the window at which she was looking was whitened by some light stuff behind it. At last then somebody had come into the drawing-room; somebody was sitting in the chair. For Heaven's sake, she prayed, let them sit still there and not come floundering out to talk to her. Mercifully, whoever it was stayed still inside; had settled by some stroke of luck so as to throw an odd-shaped triangular shadow over the step. It altered the composition of the picture a little. It was interesting. It might be useful. Her mood was coming back to her. One must keep on looking without for a second relaxing the intensity of emotion, the determination not to be put off, not to be bamboozled. One must hold the scene -- so -- in a vise and let nothing come in and spoil it. One wanted, she thought, dipping her brush deliberately, to be on a level with ordinary experience, to feel simply that's a chair, that's a table, and yet at the same time, It's a miracle, it's an ecstasy. The problem might be solved after all. Ah, but what had happened? Some wave of white went over the window pane. The air must have stirred some flounce in the room. Her heart leapt at her and seized her and tortured her.</div>
