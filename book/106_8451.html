<div class="line_en">They sat in the middle of a small lake fed by the waters of Brices Creek. It wasn't large, maybe a hundred yards across, and she was surprised at how invisible it had been just moments before.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh, Noah," she finally said softly, "it's beautiful."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They sat in silence for a long while, watching the birds. Noah pointed out a group of chicks, recently hatched, following a pack of geese near the shore, struggling to keep up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was spectacular. Tundra swan and Canada geese literally surrounded them. Thousands of them. Birds floating so close together in some places that she couldn't see the water. From a distance, the groups of swans looked almost like icebergs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The air was filled with honking and chirping as Noah moved the canoe through the water. The birds ignored them for the most part. The only ones who seemed bothered were those forced to move when the canoe approached them. Allie reached out to touch the closest ones and felt their feathers ruffling under her fingers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Noah brought out the bag of bread he'd brought earlier and handed it to Allie. She scattered the bread, favoring the little ones, laughing and smiling as they swam in circles, looking for food.</div>

<div class="line_en">They stayed until thunder boomed in the distance -- faint but powerful -- and both of them knew it was time to leave.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Noah led them back to the current of the creek, paddling stronger than he had earlier. She was still amazed by what she had seen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I don't know. I know the swans from up north migrate to Lake Matamuskeet every winter, but I guess they came here this time. I don't know why. Maybe the early blizzard had something to do with it. Maybe they got off track or something. They'll find their way back, though."</div>

<div class="line_en">"They won't stay?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I doubt it. They're driven by instinct, and this isn't their place. Some of the geese may winter here, but the swans will go back to Matamuskeet."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Noah paddled hard as dark clouds rolled directly overhead. Soon rain began to fall, a light sprinkle at first, then gradually harder. Lightning… a pause… then thunder again. A little louder now. Maybe six or seven miles away. More rain as Noah began to paddle even harder, his muscles tightening with every stroke.</div>

<div class="line_en">Allie enjoyed the rain and leaned her head back for a moment to let it hit her face. She knew the front of her dress would soak through in a couple of minutes, but she didn't care. She did wonder, though, if he noticed, then thought he probably did.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Falling with the wind…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She ran her hands through her hair, feeling its wetness. It felt wonderful, she felt wonderful, everything felt wonderful. Even through the rain, she could hear him breathing hard and the sound aroused her sexually in a way she hadn't felt in years.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Falling…</div>

<div class="line_en">Thicker drops now.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Falling hard and thick… Noah rowing… racing the sky… still getting wet… cursing to himself… losing to Mother Nature…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A cloud burst directly above them, and the rain began to come down even harder. Harder than she'd ever seen it. Allie looked upward and laughed, giving up any attempt at keeping dry, making Noah feel better. He hadn't known how she was feeling about it. Even though she'd made the decision to come, he doubted that she'd expected to be caught in a storm like this.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The downpour was steady now, and Allie watched the rain fall diagonally from the sky, trying to defy gravity as it rode on westerly winds that whistled over the trees. The sky darkened a little more, and big heavy drops fell from the clouds. Hurricane drops.</div>

<div class="line_en">They reached the dock a couple of minutes later, and Noah moved in close enough for Allie to step out. He helped her up, then got out himself and dragged the canoe up the bank far enough not to drift away. Just in case, he tied it to the dock, knowing another minute in the rain wouldn't make any difference.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As he was tying the canoe, he looked up at Allie and stopped breathing for just a second. She was incredibly beautiful as she waited, watching him, completely comfortable in the rain. She didn't try to keep dry or hide herself, and he could see the outline of her breasts as they pressed through the fabric of the dress that clung tightly to her body. It wasn't a cold rain, but he could see her nipples erect and protruding, hard like little rocks. He felt his loins begin to stir and quickly turned away, embarrassed, muttering to himself, glad the rain muffled any sound of it. When he finished and stood, Allie took his hand in hers, surprising him. Despite the downpour, they didn't rush toward the house, and Noah imagined what it would be like to spend the night with her.</div>

<div class="line_en">There was no uneasiness between them as they reached the door and both of them went inside, pausing in the foyer, clothes dripping.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Did you bring a change of clothes?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She realized then that something had changed since she'd come here. And although she couldn't pinpoint the exact time -- yesterday after dinner, or this afternoon in the canoe, or when they saw the swans, or maybe even now as they walked holding hands -- she knew that she had fallen in love with Noah Taylor Calhoun again, and that maybe, just maybe, she had never stopped.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She shook her head, still feeling the roll of emotions within her, wondering if it showed on her face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Allie, too, was wondering about him. She felt the warmth in his hands and wondered what it would be like to have them touch her body, feeling all of her, lingering slowly across her skin. Just thinking about it made her take a deep breath, and she felt her nipples begin to tingle and a new warmth between her legs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I think I can find something here for you so you can get out of those clothes. It might be a little big, but it's warm."</div>

<div class="line_en">Noah slipped off his boots, then ran up the stairs, descending a minute later. He had a pair of cotton pants and a long-sleeved shirt under one arm and some jeans with a blue shirt in the other.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She didn't want to shower after being in the rain. She liked the soft feeling on her skin, and it reminded her of how people used to live long ago. Naturally. Like Noah. She slipped on his clothes before looking at herself in the mirror. The pants were big, but tucking in the shirt helped, and she rolled up the bottoms just a little so they wouldn't drag. The neck was torn a little and it nearly hung off one shoulder, but she liked the way it looked on her anyway. She pulled the sleeves up almost to the elbows, went to the bureau, and slipped on some socks, then went to the bathroom to find a hairbrush.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She thanked him with a smile and went up the stairs, feeling his eyes on her as she walked. She entered the bedroom and closed the door, then set the pants and shirt on his bed and peeled everything off. Naked, she went to his closet and found a hanger, put her dress, bra, and panties on it, and then went to hang it in the bathroom so it wouldn't drip on the hardwood floor. She felt a secret thrill at being naked in the same room he slept in.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Anything," she said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Here," he said, handing her the cotton pants and shirt. "You can change in the bedroom upstairs. There's a bathroom and towel up there too if you want to shower."</div>

<div class="line_en">Noah was in the living room squatting before a fire, doing his best to coax it to life. He didn't see her come in, and she watched him as he worked. He had changed his clothes as well and looked good: his shoulders broad, wet hair hanging just over his collar, jeans tight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When she was finished, she checked herself in the mirror, feeling pretty despite everything, and went back down the stairs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She brushed her wet hair just enough to get out the snarls, letting it rest on her shoulders. Looking in the mirror, she wished she had brought a clasp or a couple of hairpins.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And a little more mascara. But what could she do? Her eyes still had a little of what she'd put on earlier, and she touched up with a washcloth, doing the best she could.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He poked the fire, moving the logs, and added some more kindling. Allie leaned against the door-jamb, one leg crossed over the other, and continued to watch him. In a few minutes the fire had turned to flames, even and steady. He turned to the side to straighten the remaining unused logs and caught a glimpse of her out of the corner of his eye. He turned back to her quickly.</div>

<div class="line_en">Even in his clothes she looked beautiful. After a moment he turned away shyly, going back to stacking the logs.</div>

<div class="line_en">Thunder boomed loudly, and another downpour started. Allie could hear the roaring of the rain on the roof, could hear the snapping of logs as the flickering flames lit the room. She turned to the window and saw the gray sky flash lighter for just a second. Moments later, another boom of thunder. Close this time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Noah brushed his hands on his pants, then pointed to the kitchen. "Can I get you some tea? I started the water while you were upstairs." Small talk, anything to keep his mind clear. But damn, the way she looked…</div>

<div class="line_en">She took a quilt from the sofa and sat on the rug in front of the fire. Crossing her legs, she adjusted the quilt until she was comfortable and watched the dancing flames. Noah came back, saw what she had done, and went to sit beside her. He put down two glasses and poured some bourbon into each of them. Outside, the sky grew darker.</div>

<div class="line_en">Thunder again. Loud. The storm in full fury, winds whipping the rain in circles.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's quite a storm," Noah said as he watched the drops flow in vertical streams on the windows. He and Allie were close now, though not touching, and Noah watched her chest rise slightly with every breath, imagining the feel of her body once again before fighting it back.</div>

I didn't believe that you were that way, I never did, but hearing it and thinking about all our differences made me wonder if maybe the summer meant more to me than it had meant to you… And then, while all this was going through my head, I heard from Sarah. She said that you had left New Bern."</div>

<div class="line_en">"I didn't know, and in time, the hurt began to fade and it was easier to just let it go. At least I thought it was. But in every boy I met in the next few years, I found myself looking for you, and when the feelings got too strong, I'd write you another letter. But I never sent them for fear of what I might find. By then, you'd gone on with your life and I didn't want to think about you loving someone else. I wanted to remember us like we were that summer. I didn't want to ever lose that."</div>

<div class="line_en">When I look at you, I see your beauty and grace and know they have grown stronger with every life you have lived. And I know I have spent every life before this one searching for you. Not someone like you, but you, for your soul and mine must always come together. And then, for a reason neither of us understands, we've been forced to say good-bye.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The reason it hurts so much to separate is because our souls are connected. Maybe they always have been and will be. Maybe we've lived a thousand lives before this one and in each of them we've found each other. And maybe each time, we've been forced apart for the same reasons. That means that this goodbye is both a good-bye for the past ten thousand years and a prelude to what will come.</div>

<div class="line_en">She remembered when they'd held each other like this for what they'd thought would be the last time. They were sitting on a sea wall designed to hold back the waters of the Neuse River. She was crying because they might never see each other again, and she wondered how she could ever be happy again. Instead of answering, he pressed a note into her hand, which she read on the way home. She had saved it, occasionally reading all of it or sometimes just a part. One part she'd read at least a hundred times, and for some reason it ran through her head now. It said:</div>

<div class="line_en">Could it be? she wondered. Could he be right? She had never completely discounted it, wanting to hold on to its promise in case it was true. The idea had helped her through many hard times. But sitting here now seemed to test the theory that they were destined to always be apart. Unless the stars had changed since they were last together.</div>

<div class="line_en">I would love to tell you that everything will work out for us, and I promise to do all I can to make sure it does.

We will find each other again, and maybe the stars will have changed, and we will not only love each other in that time, but for all the times we've had before.</div>

<div class="line_en">The world seemed dreamlike as she pulled back from him, the firelight setting her face aglow. Without speaking, she started to undo the buttons on his shirt. He watched her as she did it and listened to her soft breaths as she made her way downward. With each button he could feel her fingers brushing against his skin, and she smiled softly at him when she finally finished. He felt her slide her hands inside, touching him as lightly as possible, letting her hands explore his body. He was hot and she ran her hand over his slightly wet chest, feeling his hair between her fingers. Leaning in, she kissed his neck gently as she pulled the shirt over his shoulders, locking his arms behind his back. She lifted her head and allowed him to kiss her as he rolled his shoulders, freeing himself from the sleeves.</div>

<div class="line_en">They gave in then to everything they had fought the last fourteen years. Allie lifted her head off his shoulder, looked at him with hazy eyes, and Noah kissed her softly on the lips. She brought her hand to his face and touched his cheek, brushing it softly with her fingers. He leaned in slowly and kissed her again, still soft and tender, and she kissed back, feeling the years of separation dissolve into passion.</div>

Her shimmering hair trapped the light and made it sparkle. Her skin was soft and beautiful, almost glowing in the firelight. He felt her hands on his back, beckoning him.</div>

<div class="line_en">With that, he slowly reached for her. He lifted her shirt and ran his finger slowly across her belly before raising her arms and slipping it off.

His hands gently caressed her back, her arms, her shoulders, and she felt their heated bodies press together, skin to skin. He kissed her neck and nibbled gently as she lifted her hips and allowed him to pull off her bottoms. She reached for the snap on his jeans, undid it, and watched as he slipped them off as well. It was almost slow motion as their naked bodies finally came together, both of them trembling with the memory of what they had once shared together.</div>

<div class="line_en">They lay back, close to the fire, and the heat made the air seem thick. Her back was slightly arched as he rolled atop her in one fluid motion. He was on all fours above her, his knees astride her hips. She lifted her head and kissed his chin and neck, breathing hard, licking his shoulders, and tasting the sweat that lingered on his body. She ran her hands through his hair as he held himself above her, his arm muscles hard from the exertion. With a little tempting frown, she pulled him closer, but he resisted. Instead he lowered himself and lightly rubbed his chest against her, and she felt her body respond with anticipation. He did this slowly, over and over, kissing every part of her body, listening as she made soft, whimpering sounds while he moved above her.</div>

It went on and on, tingling throughout her body and warming her before finally subsiding, and she struggled to catch her breath while she trembled beneath him. But the moment it was over, another one started to build again, and she started to feel them in long sequences, one right after the next. By the time the rain had stopped and the sun had set, her body was exhausted but unwilling to stop the pleasure between them.</div>

<div class="line_en">They spent the day in each other's arms, alternately making love by the fire and then holding each other as they watched the flames curl around the wood.

Then, when they were ready, they would join again and he murmured words of love between kisses as they wrapped their arms around one another.</div>
