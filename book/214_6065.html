<div class="line_en">This time, as the distance was short, I did not mount, but ran with Dogger's stirrup-leather to the lodge gates and up the long, leafless, moonlit avenue to where the white line of the hall buildings looked on either hand on great old gardens. Here Mr. Dance dismounted, and taking me along with him, was admitted at a word into the house.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这次，由于路程短，我没有上马，只是拉着道格尔的马镫带子跑向侧面，走上那条长长的、没有树叶荫蔽的、浴着月光的林荫道。那儿通向一排两边都看得见古老的大花园的白色宅第。在大宅子门前，丹斯先生下了马，带着我一道，立刻被请进了屋里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The servant led us down a matted passage and showed us at the end into a great library, all lined with bookcases and busts upon the top of them, where the squire and Dr. Livesey sat, pipe in hand, on either side of a bright fire.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="仆人领着我们走过一条铺着席子的过道，指引我们进入它尽头的一间大图书室，里面摆满了书架，上面摆放着些石膏半身像。乡绅和利弗西医生手里拿着烟斗，分坐在火焰明亮的壁炉两旁。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I had never seen the squire so near at hand. He was a tall man, over six feet high, and broad in proportion, and he had a bluff, rough-and-ready face, all roughened and reddened and lined in his long travels. His eyebrows were very black, and moved readily, and this gave him a look of some temper, not bad, you would say, but quick and high.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我从来没在这么近的距离里看过乡绅，他是个高个子，约有六英尺多高，肩宽与身高相称，有一张坦诚的、还算看得过去的面孔，在长期的漫游过程中变得粗糙和发红，同时布满了皱纹。他的眉毛很浓密，并且迅捷地挑上挑下，这显示出他的某种脾性，不能说是坏的，你可以说是急躁、易激动。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The supervisor stood up straight and stiff and told his story like a lesson; and you should have seen how the two gentlemen leaned forward and looked at each other, and forgot to smoke in their surprise and interest. When they heard how my mother went back to the inn, Dr. Livesey fairly slapped his thigh, and the squire cried "Bravo!" and broke his long pipe against the grate. Long before it was done, Mr. Trelawney (that, you will remember, was the squire's name) had got up from his seat and was striding about the room, and the doctor, as if to hear the better, had taken off his powdered wig and sat there looking very strange indeed with his own close-cropped black poll."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="行政长官笔直僵硬地站着，好像上课似地讲述着他经历的事情经过。你可以看到，这两位绅士由于惊奇和感兴趣，在听时是怎样的向前探着身子，并且互相望着，连吸烟都忘记了。当他们听到我母亲如何地返回到小旅店时，利弗西医生简直拍起腿来，而乡绅则大叫：“好极了！”还在炉栅上敲碎了他的长烟斗。在这之前许久，特里罗尼先生（你该记得，那个，是乡绅的名字），已经从座位上站了起来，在屋子里大步走来走去，而医生，似乎为了听到更好的，摘下了他那搽了粉的假发，坐在那里，露出他自己剪得很短的黑发，看上去实在是陌生。">查看中文翻译</div>

Mr. Dance must have some ale."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“乡绅，”他说，“丹斯喝好后，当然，他还得回去为陛下服务，但我想把吉姆·霍金斯留下来，到我的房间里睡，还有，你允许的话，我建议来点冷馅饼，让他吃点东西。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Heard of him!" cried the squire. "Heard of him, you say! He was the bloodthirstiest buccaneer that sailed. Blackbeard was a child to Flint. The Spaniards were so prodigiously afraid of him that, I tell you, sir, I was sometimes proud he was an Englishman. I've seen his top-sails with these eyes, off Trinidad, and the cowardly son of a rum-puncheon that I sailed with put back -- put back, sir, into Port of Spain."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“听说过他！”乡绅叫道，“听说过他，你说的！他是江洋大盗中最为残忍的一个，黑胡子①对弗林特来说不过是黄毛小儿。西班牙人对他是畏惧之极，我跟你讲，先生，以致于我有时都为他是个英国人而骄傲哩。我在特立尼达那边曾经亲眼看到过他的中桅船，可是跟我一起航行的那个胆小的饭桶直要往后退，往后退，先生，他一直退到西班牙港哩。”【注：①英国著名的海盗。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"That we shall soon know," replied the doctor. "But you are so confoundedly hot-headed and exclamatory that I cannot get a word in. What I want to know is this: Supposing that I have here in my pocket some clue to where Flint buried his treasure, will that treasure amount to much?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这我们很快就会清楚了，”医生答道，“但是你怎么这样性急，还大嚷大叫的，让我连话都插不进来。我想知道的是这个：假定这会儿我的口袋里有关于弗林特藏宝的线索，那珠宝的总数会不会大？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Amount, sir!" cried the squire. "It will amount to this: If we have the clue you talk about, I fit out a ship in Bristol dock, and take you and Hawkins here along, and I'll have that treasure if I search a year."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“总数，先生！”乡绅叫道，“它会相当于这个：要是我们有你所说的那个线索，我就会在布里斯托尔船坞装备一艘船，然后把你和霍金斯从这儿带走，要是我找上它一年的话，一定会得到那份宝藏。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The squire and I were both peering over his shoulder as he opened it, for Dr. Livesey had kindly motioned me to come round from the side-table, where I had been eating, to enjoy the sport of the search. On the first page there were only some scraps of writing, such as a man with a pen in his hand might make for idleness or practice. One was the same as the tattoo mark, "Billy Bones his fancy"; then there was "Mr. W. Bones, mate," "No more rum," "Off Palm Key he got itt," and some other snatches, mostly single words and unintelligible. I could not help wondering who it was that had "got itt," and what "itt" was that he got. A knife in his back as like as not.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当他打开它的时候，乡绅和我都从他的肩膀上方望过去，因为利弗西医生已亲切地示意我从我进餐的小桌边绕过来，来享受这种探寻的乐趣。在扉页上，只有一些零散的字迹，就像一个人闲散无聊时随便涂画上去或是为了练字而用钢笔写在手上的那样。一个跟刺花的内容相同，“比尔·彭斯的爱物”，再有就是“W·彭斯先生，大副”，“没有郎姆酒了”，“在棕榈树低岛他得到了它”，以及其他的一些片断，大多为单个的词语，使人费解。我不禁揣摩，“得到了它”的这个人是谁，而他得到的“它”又是什么。他背上挨的刀？像又不像。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"First of all we'll try the book," observed the doctor.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“这不大能说明什么。”利弗西医生说，一边往后翻着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The next ten or twelve pages were filled with a curious series of entries. There was a date at one end of the line and at the other a sum of money, as in common account-books, but instead of explanatory writing, only a varying number of crosses between the two. On the 12th of June, 1745, for instance, a sum of seventy pounds had plainly become due to someone, and there was nothing but six crosses to explain the cause. In a few cases, to be sure, the name of a place would be added, as "Offe Caraccas," or a mere entry of latitude and longitude, as "62° 17' 20", 19° 2' 40"."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接下去的十或十二页涂满了一系列奇怪的记录。一行末了有个日期，而在另一头有个钱数，就像普通的账本，不过代替说明文字的却是两者之间的一个变化的十字数。举个例子来说，1745年6月12日，70镑的款额显然是付给某人的，但是除了六个十字外，对原因未做任何说明。极少数情况下，实在说，补加了地名，像“在卡拉卡司那边”，或者只列一项纬度和经度，如“62度17分20,19度2分40”。">查看中文翻译</div>

These crosses stand for the names of ships or towns that they sank or plundered. The sums are the scoundrel's share, and where he feared an ambiguity, you see he added something clearer. 'Offe Caraccas,' now; you see, here was some unhappy vessel boarded off that coast. God help the poor souls that manned her -- coral long ago."</div>

<div class="line_en">The paper had been sealed in several places with a thimble by way of seal; the very thimble, perhaps, that I had found in the captain's pocket. The doctor opened the seals with great care, and there fell out the map of an island, with latitude and longitude, soundings, names of hills and bays and inlets, and every particular that would be needed to bring a ship to a safe anchorage upon its shores. It was about nine miles long and five across, shaped, you might say, like a fat dragon standing up, and had two fine land-locked harbours, and a hill in the centre part marked "The Spy-glass." There were several additions of a later date, but above all, three crosses of red ink -- two on the north part of the island, one in the southwest-and beside this last, in the same red ink, and in a small, neat hand, very different from the captain's tottery characters, these words: "Bulk of treasure here."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="文件有几个地方用顶针代替封蜡密封起来。那个顶针，可能就是我在船长的口袋里找到的那个。医生小心翼翼地打开了密封，结果里面是一张岛屿的地图，上面标有纬度和经度、水深、小山、港湾和入口处的名称，以及引导一艘船安全停泊在岸边可能需要的一切细节。它大约是九英里长、五英里宽，你可以说，它的形状像一条立着的肥壮的龙，有两个几乎全为陆地包围的良港，小山位于中央，标名为“望远镜山”。图上有几处日期较近的附注；但是，最要紧的是，有三个红墨水标注的十字──两个在岛的北部，一个在西南，而且，在后者旁边，有与船长东倒西歪的笔体迥然不同的、小巧整齐的字迹，同样用红墨水写成，内容是：大部宝藏在此。">查看中文翻译</div>

These fellows who attacked the inn tonight -- bold, desperate blades, for sure -- and the rest who stayed aboard that lugger, and more, I dare say, not far off, are, one and all, through thick and thin, bound that they'll get that money. We must none of us go alone till we get to sea. Jim and I shall stick together in the meanwhile; you'll take Joyce and Hunter when you ride to Bristol, and from first to last, not one of us must breathe a word of what we've found."</div>
