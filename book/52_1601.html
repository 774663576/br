<div class="line_en">I have continued on through the cold, misty woods, breaking a path that will be unfamiliar to Gale but is simple for my feet to find. It leads to the lake. I no longer trust that our regular rendezvous spot offers privacy, and I'll need that and more to spill my guts to Gale today. But will he even come? If he doesn't, I'll have no choice but to risk going to his house in the dead of night. There are things he has to know… things I need him to help me figure out…</div>

<div class="line_en">A leather bag filled with food and a flask of hot tea. A pair of fur-lined gloves that Cinna left behind.

<div class="line_en">I waited in the hall until I had composed myself. Reminded myself I must act naturally. Then I found Madge in her room, sitting at her dressing table, brushing out her wavy blond hair before a mirror. She was in the same pretty white dress she'd worn on reaping day. She saw my reflection behind her and smiled. "Look at you. Like you came right off the streets of the Capitol."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我在走廊待了会儿，直到自己平静下来。我提醒自己一定要表情自然，之后来到马奇房间，她正坐在梳妆台旁，对着镜子梳理波浪般金黄的头发。她仍穿着原来在收获节上穿过的漂亮的白色裙子。她看到镜子里的我，笑了起来：“瞧瞧你，像刚从凯匹特的大街上回来的时髦女郎。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The jabberjays were muttations, genetically enhanced male birds created by the Capitol as weapons to spy on rebels in the districts. They could remember and repeat long passages of human speech, so they were sent into rebel areas to capture our words and return them to the Capitol. The rebels caught on and turned them against the Capitol by sending them home loaded with lies. When this was discovered, the jabberjays were left to die. In a few years, they became extinct in the wild, but not before they had mated with female mockingbirds, creating an entirely new species.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="叽喳鸟是凯匹特培育的杂交雄鸟，作为间谍武器，探查各区反叛情况。这些鸟能记住并重复人说的话，因此被投放到反叛的各区，鸟听到消息后把情报送回凯匹特。但大家发现了这点，故意让它们带回假情报。凯匹特发现后，就决定让它们自生自灭。数年时间，野外的叽喳鸟就灭绝了，但在灭绝前，它们与雌性嘲鸟交配，从而出现了一个新品种。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yeah, I guess so," I said. But it's not true. A mockingbird is just a songbird. A mockingjay is a creature the Capitol never intended to exist. They hadn't counted on the highly controlled jabberjay having the brains to adapt to the wild, to pass on its genetic code, to thrive in a new form. They hadn't anticipated its will to live.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“对啊，我想是的。”我说。可事实并非如此。嘲笑鸟确实会唱歌，但凯匹特人从未想到会产生这种鸟，他们从未想到纯粹人工培育的叽喳鸟能够适应野外生存环境，并把基因传给其他鸟，产生一种新品种，在野外生存下去。凯匹特人没料到它们有这么强的生存欲望。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now, as I trudge through the snow, I see the mockingjays hopping about on branches as they pick up on other birds' melodies, replicate them, and then transform them into something new. As always, they remind me of Rue. I think of the dream I had the last night on the train, where I followed her in mockingjay form. I wish I could have stayed asleep just a bit longer and found out where she was trying to take me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此时的野外，我穿行在雪原林地，看到嘲笑鸟在树林的枝一头跃来跃去，不时模仿另一只鸟的叫声，之后又鸣唱出新的曲调。像往常一样，这叫声让我想起露露。我想起昨晚在火车上做的梦，在梦中，我追随着鸟的鸣啭，那是露露。我希望自己睡得再长点，好知道她究竟要把我带到哪里，">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After a couple of hours, I reach an old house near the edge of the lake. Maybe "house" is too big a word for it. It's only one room, about twelve feet square. My father thought that a long time ago there were a lot of buildings -- you can still see some of the foundations -- and people came to them to play and fish in the lake. This house outlasted the others because it's made of concrete. Floor, roof, ceiling. Only one of four glass windows remains, wavy and yellowed by time. There's no plumbing and no electricity, but the fireplace still works and there's a woodpile in the corner that my father and I collected years ago. I start a small fire, counting on the mist to obscure any telltale smoke. While the fire catches, I sweep out the snow that has accumulated under the empty windows, using a twig broom my father made me when I was about eight and I played house here. Then I sit on the tiny concrete hearth, thawing out by the fire and waiting for Gale.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大约走了几个小时，我来到湖边的一座破旧的房子。也许“房子”这个字对它来说太大了。这只是一间屋子，大约十二平方英尺。爸爸认为很久以前这地方原有很多房子，一些地基仍依稀可见。人们原来到这里来游玩或在湖里钓鱼。这间屋子比其他屋子保留的时间长是因为它的地板、屋顶和天花板都是水泥的。四扇玻璃窗只有一扇还没坏，但也因天长日久颜色发黄、摇摇欲坠。这里没有上下水管道也没有电，但壁炉还能用，屋角堆放着我和爸爸多年前捡来的木头。我生了一小堆火，希望迷雾能把火堆散发的烟雾遮盖住。趁火苗渐渐旺起来的工夫，我把没窗的地方吹进来的积雪打扫干净，扫地的扫帚还是我大约八岁时爸爸用嫩树枝做的，我过家家时把它当房子。扫完了，我坐在水泥壁炉前的一小块水泥台上，一边取暖，一边等着盖尔来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It's a hike to the lake, no question. If he decides to follow me at all, Gale's going to be put out by this excessive use of energy that could be better spent in hunting. He was conspicuously absent from the dinner at the mayor's house, although the rest of his family came. Hazelle said he was home sick, which was an obvious lie. I couldn't find him at the Harvest Festival, either. Vick told me he was out hunting. That was probably true.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="去湖边的路很长，毫无疑问。如果盖尔决定跟随我，那他肯定要花很大的力气，而这力气更应该花在打猎上。很明显，他没有出席市长家的宴会，尽管他的家人都去了。黑兹尔说他病了，待在家里，很显然她在说谎。在收获节仪式上我也没有见到他。维克对我说，他去林子里打猎了，这也许是实话。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But at this point, my heart is beating so fast and fierce I hardly hear them. I only know that whatever waits in the middle of the square is meant for me. When I finally break through to the cleared space, I see I am right. And Peeta was right. And those voices were right, too.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="我看到盖尔双手被绑在一棵木桩子上，他打的火鸡用钉子穿过脖子挂在他头的上方，他的夹克被扔到一旁，衬衫被撕开。他跪在地上，后背被打得血肉模糊，已经失去知觉。只因为手腕上的绳子拴着他，才没有完全倒下。">查看中文翻译</div>
