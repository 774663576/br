<div class="line_en">As I set off down the road to town. I met many familiar faces, some Dowayo, some townsmen of Fulani or southern extraction. Politely, they enquired after the well-being of my wives and my millet crop. I did the same to them.</div>

<div class="line_en">Arrival in a West African town involves a European in a number of "formalities" that are neglected at his peril. They imply a curious mixture of self-importance and self-abasement. The average visitor will be amazed that the authorities should care one way or the other about his presence in their fair town. But should he fail to comply with the regulations, he is liable to be "discovered" as a spy or worse. So there is a fairly depressing circuit whereby one's presence is announced, rather as in earlier days Europeans would leave their visiting cards at strategic locations.</div>

<div class="line_en">It had come as a great surprise to me when I visited Africa for the first time that I was unable to recognize individual Africans, being overwhelmed by superficial differences. It is rather like one's experience before a gallery of paintings of gentlemen in periwigs. Once one has got to the third, the others have disappeared from the memory. I was pleased now to be able to remember the names of people whom I had not seen for some time, until I came to one man who clearly knew me well but was a total blank in my recollection. With embarrassment, I realized that the problem was that he had changed his shirt. Most Dowayos only possess one shirt for everyday wear so, inevitably, they wear the same one all the time. Although they normally wash themselves on the way home from the fields, they almost never wash their clothes, simply wearing them to the point of disintegration and sometimes beyond. The beginner learns to recognize people by their clothes rather than their features.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第一次造访非洲时，我很讶异自己居然无法辨识非洲人的脸孔，虽然他们的外表各有极大差异。这就像参观画廊，走过一幅幅头戴假发的古代绅士肖像，看到第三幅，你就忘了前两幅的模样。这次前来，我很高兴自己叫得出每个人的名字，即使我们已经许久未见，直到我遇见一个显然认识我，我对他却记忆空白的人。大感困窘，我赫然发现问题出在他换衬衫了。多数多瓦悠人只有一件衬衫，理所当然，他们天天都穿同一件衬衫。虽然下田工作回家途中，他们会到池塘洗澡，但是从来不洗衣服，而是把衣服穿到解体、穿到烂为止。初到非洲者辨识非洲人是以衣服为准，而非脸孔。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A corporal appeared from inside, distinctly less jovial than the loungers. His first move was to warn me that I was on government property and must take no photographs. Since I had no camera with me, this was a redundant instruction, but one accepted with due meekness. We proceeded to an inspection of my passport, with much suspicious scowling and holding up of stamps to the light. It was regrettable that the chief had departed on a mission of importance and delicacy to Garoua. Only he could take the step of allowing me to sign my name in the large book kept for aliens. How long would he be? Should I wait? This was not foreseeable but they would call the police headquarters in Garoua to verify whether he had left yet. A large radio was produced from inside the cupboard and the corporal began shouting into it amid bursts of hiss and static. A faint voice, as of a drowning man, could be heard saying something with great insistence, then in a brief pause could be heard to ask very clearly, "What do you want?" to which the corporal replied, "Who?" before the static closed in again like fog.</div>

<div class="line_en">At that moment, a somewhat raddled Land-Rover drew up in a cloud of dust. Its green canvas top had been replaced by one of sky-blue and domestic manufacture, giving it a holiday-camp air. From this, disembarked the chief, a trifle hot and dusty but with the air of a man having come from a job well done.</div>

<div class="line_en">As I moved off, I peered in the back of the machine. As I had guessed, it was full of beer. Subsequent investigation revealed a rumour that the vehicle was used to haul beer down to the villages on the River Faro, some thirty miles away, otherwise devoid of drink. There, it was claimed, it sold for fabulous prices.</div>

<div class="line_en">In many parts of Cameroon, when the colonial forces arrived, they found a system whereby Fulani overlords ruled over pagan peoples. They found it convenient to generalize this system to parts where Fulani incursors had not reached, as at Poli. There is now a Fulani chief in the town who sits on the native court and claims jurisdiction over the area. Local Dowayos resent this very much and have as little to do with him as possible. As far as they are concerned, they were never defeated by the Fulanis. He would certainly not be welcome in their villages.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="殖民帝国军队抵达喀麦隆后，发现喀国许多地方都由富来尼封主统治异教人民。他们觉得这套统治系统颇方便，便推广至富来尼侵略者原先并未占据的地方，譬如波利。现在波利镇有个富来尼酋长，坐镇土著的法庭，管辖权涵盖整个波利区域。当地的多瓦悠人对此极端痛恨，尽量不与该酋长有任何接触。对他们而言，富来尼人从未征服他们。他在多瓦悠村落绝对不会受到欢迎。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At the other end of town, the dank and depressing sous-préfet's office that I recalled had been spruced up by the application of a coat of whitewash. White-robed, clerkly figures shuffled in sandals from room to room with handfuls of papers. Admittedly their gait was hardly swift but it was the first time that anyone had been seen moving about at all in that building. The clerk who controlled admission told me that the sous-préfet was not available. Being a Dowayo, however, he revealed that he might be found if I dropped in on the town chief.</div>

<div class="line_en">On my previous visit, he had not exactly endeared himself to me. As the proprietor of the mail truck, he had a virtual monopoly of transport between Poli and the big cities. Being very close to the old sous-préfet, he had worked hard to ensure that no bus service was permitted, no petrol sold, no one else allowed to carry passengers. Because the presence of a foreigner would attract the attention of the police to his always illegally overloaded truck, he had always made it as difficult as possible for me to travel on his vehicle, going to such lengths as changing the pick-up points or days of departure when I was out of town. A further source of friction had been his determined attempts to make me take out membership of the one political party permitted in Cameroon -- an operation on which he received a commission.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="上次我旅居此地时，这位富来尼酋长对我不算友善。他拥有邮件卡车，形同垄断波利与其他城镇的交通。他与卸任的副县长关系密切，极力确保波利镇不会出现公车，不贩售汽油，其他人的车辆不准载客。他的邮件卡车如果搭载外国人，便会引来警察注意，让他经常超载的事情曝光，因此他总是百般刁难让我无法搭上邮件车，大费周章改变载客处或将出发时间调动至我不在的日子。我们的另一个摩擦来自他不屈不挠要我加入喀国唯一的政党——他能从中抽取介绍费。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The sous-préfet rose and greeted me. He grinned and addressed a few words in Fulani to the town chief who scowled, drew forth the bottle and poured me a small quantity in a glass stamped "Souvenir from Cannes". We settled ourselves and the sous-préfet began to discourse in perfect French on his plans for the town. His eyes gleamed enthusiastically behind his glasses as he told of piped water and the re-installation of mains electricity (a convenience that had been allowed to lapse since the departure of the French). He was determined to have a telephone before two years had passed. "My job is to animate," he explained. "I have already explained to my friend here", he indicated the chief, "that his house may have to be demolished for my telephone exchange." He giggled wickedly to which the chief returned a wan half-smile.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="副县长起身迎接我。他露出笑容，和酋长说了几句富来尼语后者皱皱眉，拿出威士忌，在一个印有“坎城纪念品”字样的杯子里倒了一点。我们落座，副县长开始以字正腔圆的法语诉说他对波利镇的未来规划。他的眼睛在眼镜背后热切发光，大谈铺设自来水与重接电力管路（自从法国人退出喀国后，这些民生便利措施便付阙如）。副县长决心两年内要架设电话。“我的工作就是为此地注入生气，”他解释：“我刚跟这位朋友说，”他指指酋长：“他的房子可能要拆掉来盖电话交换机呢。”他淘气地咯咯笑。酋长则回报以苍白微笑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After much hand-clapping outside the chief's house, a small boy appeared and scuttled off to announce my arrival.

<div class="line_en">The ethics of anthropology are not easy. The anthropologist normally attempts to influence the people he is studying as little as possible but knows that he must have some effect. At the best, he may restore to a demoralized, marginal people something of a sense of their own worth and the value of their own culture. But, by the very act of writing the standard monograph on any people, he presents them with an image of themselves that must be coloured by his own prejudices and preconceptions since there is no objective reality about an alien people. The use they make of this image is unpredictable. They may reject it and react against it. They may also change to conform more closely to it and become ossified actors portraying themselves. Either way, innocence, the sense that something is done because this is the only way things can be, is lost.</div>
