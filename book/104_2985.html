<div class="line_en">One of his former employees, the scion of a distinguished family, suggested I spend a few months in the residence of his impoverished cousins, a Mr. McCoo, retired, and his wife, who wanted to let their upper story where a late aunt had delicately dwelt. He said they had two little daughters, one a baby, the other a girl of twelve, and a beautiful garden, not far from a beautiful lake, and I said it sounded perfectly perfect.</div>

<div class="line_en">I exchanged letters with these people, satisfying them I was housebroken, and spent a fantastic night on the train, imagining in all possible detail the enigmatic nymphet I would coach in French and fondle in Humbertish. Nobody met me at the toy station where I alighted with my new expensive bag, and nobody answered the telephone; eventually, however, a distraught McCoo in wet clothes turned up at the only hotel of green-and-pink Ramsdale with the news that his house had just burned down -- possibly, owing to the synchronous conflagration that had been raging all night in my veins. His family, he said, had fled to a farm he owned, and had taken the car, but a friend of his wife's, a grand person, Mrs. Haze of 342 Lawn Street, offered to accommodate me. A lady who lived opposite Mrs. Haze's had lent McCoo her limousine, a marvelously old-fashioned, square-topped affair, manned by a cheerful Negro. Now, since the only reason for my coming at all had vanished, the aforesaid arrangement seemed preposterous. All right, his house would have to be completely rebuilt, so what? Had he not insured it sufficiently? I was angry, disappointed and bored, but being a polite European, could not refuse to be sent off to Lawn Street in that funeral car, feeling that otherwise McCoo would devise an even more elaborate means of getting rid of me. I saw him scamper away, and my chauffeur shook his head with a soft chuckle. En route, I swore to myself I would not dream of staying in Ramsdale under any circumstance but would fly that very day to the Bermudas or the Bahamas or the Blazes. Possibilities of sweetness on technicolor beaches had been trickling through my spine for some time before, and McCoo's cousin had, in fact, sharply diverted that train of thought with his well-meaning but as it transpired now absolutely inane suggestion.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我和他们通了信，他们满意我的良好习惯；于是，在火车上过了充满幻想的一夜，想象着我将施予那象迷一样的性感少女的全部细节，用法国方式训练她，用亨伯特方式抚爱她。我提着那只贵重的提包从车上下来，玩具般的小车站上无人接候，打电话去也没人接；最后，一位心神不安、浑身湿透了的麦库出现在绿紫色的拉姆斯代尔唯一一家旅店门口，带来消息，说他的房子刚刚烧毁了——很可能，起因于整夜在我心头蔓延的熊熊大火。他说，他家人乘飞机去他的农场了，小汽车也正用着；不过他妻子有位朋友，一个高贵的人，住在草坪街342号的黑兹夫人，愿意留我宿下。住在黑兹夫人对面的一位妇人把她的轿车借给了麦库，一辆非常漂亮的老式方顶轿车，司机是个快乐的黑人。现在，我到这里来的唯一意义已经彻底丧失，上边说的安排听起来就很荒谬。是啊，他的住宅会完全修复的，那又怎么样？他不是充分保证了吗？我气愤、失望、感到无聊，但作为有礼的欧洲人，我不能拒绝被那辆丧车送到草坪街去，不然，我觉得麦库就会想出更绝妙的方法抛掉我。看着他急匆匆地跑走了，我的司机摇摇头轻轻地笑起来。汽车开动时，我对自己发誓，任何情况下也绝不梦想呆在拉姆斯代尔，我要在当天就飞到百慕大或巴哈马或布勒兹。五光十色的海岸上可能遇到的鲜香过去一直在我脊骨上缓缓流动，而麦库的表亲实际上已经用他原本好心好意、但现在却是完全无意义的建议，强硬地扭转了我一系列的思绪。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Upon signing out, I cast around for some place in the New England countryside or sleepy small town (elms, white church) where I could spend a studious summer subsisting on a compact boxful of notes I had accumulated and bathing in some nearby lake. My work had begun to interest me again -- I mean my scholarly exertions; the other thing, my active participation in my uncle's posthumous perfumes, had by then been cut down to a minimum.</div>

<div class="line_en">Speaking of sharp turns: we almost ran over a meddlesome suburban dog (one of those who lie in wait for cars) as we swerved into Lawn Street. A little further, the Haze house, a white-frame horror, appeared, looking dingy and old, more gray than white -- the kind of place you know will have a rubber tube affixable to the tub faucet in lieu of shower. I tipped the chauffeur and hoped he would immediately drive away so that I might double back unnoticed to my hotel and bag; but the man merely crossed to the other side of the street where an old lady was calling to him from her porch. What could I do? I pressed the bell button.</div>

<div class="line_en">The front hall was graced with door chimes, a white-eyed wooden thingamabob of commercial Mexican origin, and that banal darling of the arty middle class, van Gogh's "Arlésienne." A door ajar to the right afforded a glimpse of a living room, with some more Mexican trash in a corner cabinet and a striped sofa along the wall. There was a staircase at the end of the hallway, and as I stood mopping my brow (only now did I realize how hot it had been out-of-doors) and staring, to stare at something, at an old gray tennis ball that lay on an oak chest, there came from the upper landing the contralto voice of Mrs. Haze, who leaning over the banisters inquired melodiously, "Is that Monsieur Humbert?" A bit of cigarette ash dropped from there in addition. Presently, the lady herself -- sandals, maroon slacks, yellow silk blouse, squarish face, in that order -- came down the steps, her index finger still tapping upon her cigarette.</div>

<div class="line_en">I think I had better describe her right away, to get it over with. The poor lady was in her middle thirties, she had a shiny forehead, plucked eyebrows and quite simple but not unattractive features of a type that may be defined as a weak solution of Marlene Dietrich. Patting her bronze-brown bun, she led me into the parlor and we talked for a minute about the McCoo fire and the privilege of living in Ramsdale. Her very wide-set sea-green eyes had a funny way of traveling all over you, carefully avoiding your own eyes. Her smile was but a quizzical jerk of one eyebrow; and uncoiling herself from the sofa as she talked, she kept making spasmodic dashes at three ashtrays and the near fender (where lay the brown core of an apple); whereupon she would sink back again, one leg folded under her. She was, obviously, one of those women whose polished words may reflect a book club or bridge club, or any other deadly conventionality, but never her soul; women who are completely devoid of humor; women utterly indifferent at heart to the dozen or so possible subjects of a parlor conversation, but very particular about the rules of such conversations, through the sunny cellophane of which not very appetizing frustrations can be readily distinguished. I was perfectly aware that if by any wild chance I became her lodger, she would methodically proceed to do in regard to me what taking a lodger probably meant to her all along, and I would again be enmeshed in one of those tedious affairs I knew so well.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我觉得我最好直截了当地描述她，可以清晰易解。可怜的妇人三十五六了，她的额头很有光泽，眉毛剔过，五官端正但不动人，或许能形容为玛雷娜的一次不稳固分解。她拍着铜褐色的卷发，领我走进客厅，我们聊了一会麦库的火灾，以及在拉姆斯代尔居住的特权。她那特别大的海绿色眼睛非常有意思地在你周身上下移动，又小心翼翼地避开你的目光。她的笑只是一条眉毛挑逗地猛跳一下；一边说着，时面在沙发里伸展一下身体，时而朝三个烟灰缸和身旁的炉围（那上面放着一只褐色苹果核）冲击，而后又落座，一条腿压在另一条腿下。很显然她是那类妇女，她们经过修饰的谈吐颇能代表一家图书俱乐部或桥牌俱乐部或任何古板聚会的风格，却永远不能反映她们的灵魂；一批毫无幽默感的妇人；在内心深处对客厅交谈的所有主题完全漠然，但对这种谈话的形式却甚为讲究。透过太阳光下的玻璃纸，她的失意一目了然。我非常明白无论多么偶然我成了她的房客，对于我，她会有步骤、有头有尾地做完能对宿客做的一切；我于是就又会陷入一张肮脏交易的网，这些我知道得很。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But there was no question of my settling there. I could not be happy in that type of household with bedraggled magazines on every chair and a kind of horrible hybridization between the comedy of so-called "functional modern furniture" and the tragedy of decrepit rockers and rickety lamp tables with dead lamps. I was led upstairs, and to the left -- into "my" room. I inspected it through the mist of my utter rejection of it; but I did discern above "my" bed René Prinet's "Kreutzer Sonata." And she called that servant maid's room a "semi-studio"! Let's get out of here at once, I firmly said to myself as I pretended to deliberate over the absurdly, and ominously, low price that my wistful hostess was asking for board and bed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但我住下来是毫无问题的。对那种每张椅子上都堆着邋遢杂志的家务事，以及在所谓“实用的现代家俱”喜剧与老朽的摇椅、患佝偻病的台灯桌上摆着摇摇欲坠的台灯的悲剧之间发生的可怕的杂交现象，我不能感到快乐。我被领上楼，向左——进入“我的”房间。我透过绝对抵触的心情审视它；但我确实在“我”的床上方辨认出勒内。普里耐的“克莱采奏鸣曲”。她管那间佣人的屋子叫“小工作室”！当我试图慎重地考虑我狡黠的女主人对我的食宿收取那么低的价钱，是多么荒唐且更显不吉利，我对自己坚定地说，还是让我们赶紧离开这儿吧。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Old-world politeness, however, obliged me to go on with the ordeal. We crossed the landing to the right side of the house (where "I and Lo have our rooms"-- Lo being presumably the maid), and the lodger-lover could hardly conceal a shudder when he, a very fastidious male, was granted a preview of the only bathroom, a tiny oblong between the landing and "Lo's" room, with limp wet things overhanging the dubious tub (the question mark of a hair inside); and there were the expected coils of the rubber snake, and its complement -- a pinkish cozy, coyly covering the toilet lid.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，旧时代的彬彬有礼强迫我继续这场痛苦的考验。我们穿过楼梯顶端的走廊，来到住宅的右半部（“我和洛的房间”在那儿——洛被推测为那位女仆）；当投宿者情人，一个非常苛刻的人，被准许预先查看了唯一的一间浴室后，便根本不能隐瞒他的颤栗了，那是个很小的长方形，就在我和“洛的”卧室之间，有一团柔软、湿德源的东西悬在用途不明的马桶上方（桶里有一根头发弯成的问号）；不出所料桶里还有橡皮蛇似的一团发卷，以及桶的附属品——一个紫红色棉垫羞答答罩在马桶盖上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Reluctantly I followed her downstairs again; then through the kitchen at the end of the hall, on the right side of the house -- the side where also the dining room and the parlor were (under "my" room, on the left, there was nothing but a garage). In the kitchen, the Negro maid, a plump youngish woman, said, as she took her large glossy black purse from the knob of the door leading to the back porch: "I'll go now, Mrs. Haze." "Yes, Louise," answered Mrs. Haze with a sigh. "I'll settle with you Friday." We passed on to a small pantry and entered the dining room, parallel to the parlor we had already admired. I noticed a white sock on the floor. With a deprecatory grunt, Mrs. Haze stooped without stopping and threw it into a closet next to the pantry. We cursorily inspected a mahogany table with a fruit vase in the middle, containing nothing but the still glistening stone of one plum. I groped for the timetable I had in my pocket and surreptitiously fished it out to look as soon as possible for a train. I was still walking behind Mrs. Haze through the dining room when, beyond it, there came a sudden burst of greenery --"the piazza," sang out my leader, and then, without the least warning, a blue sea-wave swelled under my heart and, from a mat in a pool of sun, half-naked, kneeling, turning about on her knees, there was my Riviera love peering at me over dark glasses.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我没奈何又跟她下了楼；而后穿过大厅末端的厨房，来到住宅的右半部——这部分也是用饭间和走廊的所在（“我”房下的那个左半边没什么，只有个汽车间。）厨房里，那个脏乎乎的年轻女黑仆，一边从通向后门廊的门把上取下她黑得发亮的提包，一边说：“我这就走了，黑兹夫人。”可以，露易丝，”黑兹夫人叹口气答道，“星期五我会和你解决的。”我们又走过一间很小的食品室，进到用饭间，它和我们已经称赞过的走廊是平行的。我看见地板上有双白袜子。黑兹夫人吐噜了一句道歉的话，立刻弯下身，随手把它扔进边柜里，我们草草地检查了中间摆着一只果盘的红木餐桌，果盘里只有一个还发着亮光的李子核。我在兜里摸索着火车时刻表，偷偷掏出来，以最快的速度找出了一趟车。穿过用饭间，我仍跟在黑兹夫人身后，突然眼前出现了一片绿叶——“游廊，”我的指引者唱道，然后，未经半点提示，一排蓝色的海浪便从我心底涌起，在太阳沐浴的一块草垫上，半裸着，跪着，以膝盖为轴转过身，我的“里维埃拉”之恋正透过墨镜向我窥视。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I see you are not too favorably impressed," said the lady letting her hand rest for a moment upon my sleeve: she combined a cool forwardness -- the overflow of what I think is called "poise"-- with a shyness and sadness that caused her detached way of selecting her words to seem as unnatural as the intonation of a professor of "speech." "This is not a neat household, I confess," the doomed dear continued, "but I assure you [she looked at my lips], you will be very comfortable, very comfortable, indeed. Let me show you the garden" (the last more brightly, with a kind of winsome toss of the voice).</div>

<div class="line_en">I find it most difficult to express with adequate force that flash, that shiver, that impact of passionate recognition. In the course of the sun-shot moment that my glance slithered over the kneeling child (her eyes blinking over those stern dark spectacles -- the little Herr Doktor who was to cure me of all my aches) while I passed by her in my adult disguise (a great big handsome hunk of movieland manhood), the vacuum of my soul managed to suck in every detail of her bright beauty, and these I checked against the features of my dead bride. A little later, of course, she, this nouvelle, this Lolita, my Lolita, was to eclipse completely her prototype. All I want to stress is that my discovery of her was a fatal consequence of that "princedom by the sea" in my tortured past. Everything between the two events was but a series of gropings and blunders, and false rudiments of joy. Everything they shared made one of them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我发现要恰如其份地表现一刹那的那种颤栗、那种动了感情发现的碰撞，真是最为困难。在太阳投射的时刻，我的目光滑过了跪着的孩子（她的眼睛在那副严肃的墨镜后闪烁——小大夫会治愈我所有的疼痛），我从她身边走过，打起成人的伪装（一个高大、漂亮的东欧人，电影圈里的绅士），但我灵魂的真空却把她闪光的美丽每一处细节都吸在眼里，又把它和我死去的心爱人一一对比。当然，片刻之后，她，这个新人儿，这个洛丽塔，我的洛丽塔，便要彻底遮蔽她天体的原色。我想强调的是，我对她的发现乃是在扭曲的过去里建筑的那座“海边王国”的致命后果。在这两件事之间的一切只是一系列的摸索和失策，以及误入歧途的享乐。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was the same child -- the same frail, honey-hued shoulders, the same silky supple bare back, the same chestnut head of hair. A polka-dotted black kerchief tied around her chest hid from my aging ape eyes, but not from the gaze of young memory, the juvenile breasts I had fondled one immortal day. And, as if I were the fairy-tale nurse of some little princess (lost, kidnaped, discovered in gypsy rags through which her nakedness smiled at the king and his hounds), I recognized the tiny dark-brown mole on her side. With awe and delight (the king crying for joy, the trumpets blaring, the nurse drunk) I saw again her lovely indrawn abdomen where my southbound mouth had briefly paused; and those puerile hips on which I had kissed the crenulated imprint left by the band of her shorts -- that last mad immortal day behind the "Roches Roses." The twenty-five years I had lived since then tapered to a palpitating point, and vanished.</div>
