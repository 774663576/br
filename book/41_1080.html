<div class="line_en">"It's crazy, no?" Amra says, then lets out a bewildered chuckle. In the week that Idris has been back in Kabul, he has found this tone of lighthearted exasperation common among the foreign-aid workers, who've had to navigate the inconveniences and idiosyncrasies of Afghan culture. He is vaguely offended by this entitlement to cheerful mocking, this license to condescend, though the locals don't seem to take notice, or take it as an insult if they do, and so he thinks he probably shouldn't either.</div>

<div class="line_en">They are standing at the end of a long, poorly lit hallway in the men's wing of Wazir Akbar Khan Hospital. Amra said the only relative the girl had left -- or the only one who visited -- was her uncle, and if she'd been placed in the women's wing he would not be permitted to visit her. So the staff had placed her in the men's wing, not in a room -- it would be indecent for the girl to room with men who were not relatives -- but here, at the end of the hallway, a no-man's- and no-woman's-land.</div>

<div class="line_en">Idris glances at the nurse, worried that this tease, a little reckless and unnecessary, might have offended her, but it appears Timur has gotten away with it. Idris both resents and envies his cousin for this ability. He has always found Timur coarse, lacking in imagination and nuance. He knows that Timur cheats on both his wife and his taxes. Back in the States, Timur owns a real-estate mortgage company, and Idris is all but certain that he is waist-deep in some kind of mortgage fraud. But Timur is wildly sociable, his faults forever absolved by good humor, a determined friendliness, and a beguiling air of innocence that endears him to people he meets. The good looks don't hurt, either -- the muscular body, the green eyes, the dimpled grin. Timur, Idris thinks, is a grown man enjoying the privileges of a child.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="伊德里斯看了一眼女护士，担心铁木尔这种有点鲁莽，又没什么必要的挑逗会触怒她，但是明摆着，这点儿小便宜又让他占到了。对堂弟的这种能力，伊德里斯既厌恶又嫉妒。他总是注意到铁木尔的粗俗，觉得他缺心眼儿，又不解人意。他知道铁木尔不仅对妻子不忠，还作假逃税。在美国，铁木尔开了一家房屋按揭贷款公司，伊德里斯几乎可以肯定，他在大搞贷款欺诈。但是铁木尔交游广泛，即便惹祸上身，也总是能用好人缘、铁关系，以及那副人见人爱、假装无辜的面具加以摆平。长得帅可没坏处——肌肉发达的身体，碧绿的眼睛，带酒窝的笑容。伊德里斯觉得，铁木尔固然是个成年人，却还在享受着儿童的特权。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The girl -- Roshi, as Amra had called her, short for "Roshana"-- looks to be nine, maybe ten. She is sitting up on a steel-frame bed, back to the wall, knees bent up against her chest. Idris immediately drops his gaze. He swallows down a gasp before it can escape him. Predictably, such restraint proves beyond Timur. He tsks his tongue, and says, "Oh! Oh! Oh!" over and over in a loud, pained whisper. Idris glances over to Timur and is not surprised to find swollen tears shivering theatrically in his eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="女孩本名罗莎娜，可阿姆拉给了她一个简称，叫她罗诗。她看上去大约九岁，也许十岁，此时膝盖顶着胸脯，背朝墙坐在铁床上。伊德里斯马上放低了目光，一口凉气已经到了嘴边，又硬生生地倒吸回去。可想而知，铁木尔才压不住呢。他咂着舌头，不停地说着“噢！噢！噢！”声音不大，却清晰可闻，充满了痛苦。伊德里斯瞟了一眼铁木尔，毫不吃惊地发现他已经眼泪汪汪，泪水戏剧化地在他眼眶里打着转儿。">查看中文翻译</div>

Timur, whose tears have vanished as swiftly as they'd materialized, takes a cigarette and lights both hers and his. Idris feels queasy, light-headed. His mouth has gone dry. He worries he's going to vomit and disgrace himself, confirm Amra's view of him, of them -- the wealthy, wide-eyed exiles -- come home to gawk at the carnage now that the boogeymen have left.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the States, Timur goes by "Tim." He changed his name after 9/11 and claims that he has nearly doubled his business since. Losing those two letters, he has said to Idris, has already done more for his career than a college degree would have -- if he'd gone to college, which he hadn't; Idris is the Bashiri family academic. But now since their arrival in Kabul, Idris has heard him introduce himself only as Timur. It is a harmless enough duplicity, even a necessary one. But it rankles.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在美国，铁木尔用的是“蒂姆”。“9·11”事件后，他改了名，并且声称，自此以后他的生意差不多翻了两番。他告诉伊德里斯，改成这两个字，给他事业带来的好处比大学文凭还要多——如果他上过大学的话。他没上过。伊德里斯才是巴希里家族的大才子。可是这次回到喀布尔，伊德里斯听到他总是自称铁木尔。这种表里不一当然无伤大雅，甚至非这样做不可，可还是让人耿耿于怀。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Timur launches into it. The outline of what he says is more or less true. That they are cousins, that their families fled after the Soviets rolled in, that they spent a year in Pakistan before settling in California in the early eighties. That this is the first time back for them both in twenty years. But then he adds that they have come back to "reconnect," to "educate" themselves, "bear witness" to the aftermath of all these years of war and destruction. They want to go back to the States, he says, to raise awareness, and funds, to "give back."</div>

<div class="line_en">Of course Timur does not share the real reason they have come back to Kabul: to reclaim the property that had belonged to their fathers, the house where both he and Idris had lived for the first fourteen years of their lives. The property's worth is skyrocketing now that thousands of foreign-aid workers have descended on Kabul and need a place to live. They were there earlier in the day, at the house, which is currently home to a ragtag group of weary-looking Northern Alliance soldiers. As they were leaving, they had met a middle-aged man who lived three houses down and across the street, a Greek plastic surgeon named Markos Varvaris. He had invited them to lunch and offered to give them a tour of Wazir Akbar Khan Hospital, where the NGO he worked for had an office. He also invited them to a party that night. They had learned about the girl only upon their arrival at the hospital -- overhearing two orderlies talking about her on the front steps -- after which Timur had elbowed Idris and said, We should check it out, bro.</div>

<div class="line_en">Idris's own father had died nine years before after a long bout with cancer. He had died at his home, with his wife, two daughters, and Idris at his bedside. The day he died, a mob descended on the house -- uncles, aunts, cousins, friends, and acquaintances -- sitting on the couches, the dining chairs, and, when those were taken, on the floor, the stairs. Women gathered in the dining room and kitchen. They brewed thermos after thermos of tea. Idris, as the only son, had to sign all the papers -- papers for the medical examiner, who arrived to pronounce his father dead; papers for the polite young men from the funeral home, who came with a stretcher to take his father's body.</div>

He ordered rice and lamb from Abe's Kabob House, a local Afghan restaurant run by Timur's friend Abdullah, whom Timur teasingly called Uncle Abe. Timur parked cars for elderly guests when it started to rain. He called a buddy of his at one of the local Afghan TV stations. Unlike Idris, Timur was well connected in the Afghan community; he once told Idris that he had over three hundred contact names and numbers on his cell phone. He made arrangements for an announcement to run on Afghan TV that same night.</div>

And at the wedding, Timur had the singer stop the music, make an announcement, and the key to the Explorer had been offered to Idris and Nahil with great ceremony -- on a tray, no less -- before an attentive audience. Cameras had flashed. This was what Idris had misgivings about, the fanfare, the flaunting, the unabashed showmanship, the bravado. He didn't like thinking this of his cousin, who was the closest thing Idris had to a brother, but it seemed to him that Timur was a man who wrote his own press kit, and his generosity, Idris suspected, was a calculated piece of an intricately constructed character.</div>

<div class="line_en">It's an ordinary two-story house that in Idris's neighborhood in San Jose would draw the ire of the HOA folks. But by Kabul standards, it's a lavish property, with high walls, metal gates, and a wide driveway. As he and Timur are led inside by an armed guard, Idris sees that, like many things he has seen in Kabul, the house has a whiff of past splendor beneath the ruin that has been visited upon it -- of which there is ample evidence: bullet holes and zigzagging cracks in the sooty walls, exposed bricks beneath wide missing patches of plaster, dead bushes in the driveway, leafless trees in the garden, yellowed lawn. More than half of the veranda that overlooks the backyard is missing. But also like many things in Kabul, there is evidence of slow, hesitant rebirth. Someone has begun to repaint the house, planted rosebushes in the garden, a missing chunk of the garden's east-facing wall has been replaced, albeit a little clumsily. A ladder is propped against the side of the house facing the street, leading Idris to think that roof repair is under way. Repair on the missing half of the veranda has apparently begun.</div>

There are posters of the Bamiyan Buddhas, of a Buzkashi game, one of a harbor in a Greek island named Tinos. He has never heard of Tinos. He spots a framed photograph in the foyer, black-and-white, a little blurry, as though it had been shot with a homemade camera. It's of a young girl with long black hair, her back to the lens.

Forties model, maybe early fifties -- Idris can't quite see -- and, besides, he has never been a car guy. He is sure Timur would know.

Tearing through the war-torn city like he belongs here, backslapping locals with great bonhomie and calling them brother, sister, uncle, making a show of handing money to beggars from what he calls the Bakhsheesh bundle, joking with old women he calls mother and talking them into telling their story into his camcorder as he strikes a woebegone expression, pretending he is one of them, like he's been here all along, like he wasn't lifting at Gold's in San Jose, working on his pecs and abs, when these people were getting shelled, murdered, raped.

He asks about her work, and she tells him that she has served in Kosovo with the UN, in Rwanda after the genocide, Colombia, Burundi too. She has worked with child prostitutes in Cambodia. She has been in Kabul for a year now, her third stint, this time with a small NGO, working at the hospital and running a mobile clinic on Mondays. Married twice, divorced twice, no kids. Idris finds it hard to guess at Amra's age, though likely she's younger than she looks.

<div class="line_en">After the Germans pick up Timur, Idris lies in bed for a while, staring at a faded sixties-era advertising poster hanging on the wall, a quartet of smiling blond tourists hiking along Band-e-Amir Lake, a relic from his own childhood here in Kabul before the wars, before the unraveling. Early afternoon, he goes for a walk. At a small restaurant, he eats kabob for lunch. It's hard to enjoy the meal with all the grimy young faces peering through the glass, watching him eat. It's overwhelming. Idris admits to himself that Timur is better at this than he is. Timur makes a game of it. Like a drill sergeant, he whistles and makes the beggar kids queue up, whips out a few bills from the Bakhsheesh bundle. As he hands out the bills, one by one, he clicks his heels and salutes. The kids love it. They salute back. They call him Kaka. Sometimes they climb up his legs.</div>

<div class="line_en">Carrying the box, he walks down the hallway, past graffiti-spangled walls, rooms with plastic sheeting for doors, a shuffling barefoot old man with an eye patch, patients lying in stifling-hot rooms with missing lightbulbs. A sour-body smell everywhere. At the end of the hallway, he pauses at the curtain before pulling it back. He feels a lurch in his heart when he sees the girl sitting on the edge of the bed. Amra is kneeling before her, brushing her small teeth.</div>

<div class="line_en">There is a man sitting on the other side of the bed, gaunt, sunburned, with a rat's-nest beard and stubbly dark hair. When Idris enters, the man quickly gets up, flattens a hand against his chest, and bows. Idris is struck again by how easily the locals can tell he is a westernized Afghan, how the whiff of money and power affords him unwarranted privilege in this city. The man tells Idris he is Roshi's uncle, from the mother's side.</div>

T., Babe, Toy Story, and The Iron Giant. He has watched them all with his own boys back home.</div>

She ties her arms around his waist, a tide of relief washing over her face. His visits are what she looks forward to most, she has told him. Sometimes she clutches his hand with both of hers as they watch a tape. When he is away from her, he thinks often of the faint yellow hairs on her arms, her narrow hazel eyes, her pretty feet, her rounded cheeks, the way she cups her chin in her hands as he reads her one of the children's books he has picked up from a bookstore near the French lycée. A few times, he has allowed himself to fleetingly imagine what it would be like to bring her to the U. S., how she would fit in with his boys, Zabi and Lemar, back home. This last year, he and Nahil had talked about the possibility of a third child.</div>

<div class="line_en">They go to Abe's Kabob House over on the east side of San Jose near the old Berryessa Flea Market. The owner, Abdullah, is a gray-haired man in his early sixties, with a handlebar mustache and strong-looking hands. He is one of Idris's patients, as is his wife. Abdullah waves from behind the register when Idris and his family enter the restaurant. Abe's Kabob House is a small family business. There are only eight tables -- sheathed by often sticky vinyl covers -- laminated menus, posters of Afghanistan on the walls, an old soda machine, a "merchandiser," in the corner. Abdullah greets the guests, runs the register, cleans. His wife, Sultana, is in the back; she is the one responsible for the magic. Idris can see her now in the kitchen, stooped over something, her hair stuffed up under a net cap, her eyes narrowed against the steam. She and Abdullah had married in Pakistan in the late 1970s, they have told Idris, after the communist takeover back home. They were granted asylum in the U. S. in 1982, the year their daughter, Pari, was born.</div>

<div class="line_en">A few years ago, Idris had discovered that Nahil was supporting a Colombian kid named Miguel. She'd said nothing to him about it, and since she was in charge of the mail and their finances Idris had not known about it for years until he'd seen her one day reading a letter from Miguel. The letter had been translated from Spanish by a nun. There was a picture too, of a tall, wiry boy standing outside a straw hut, cradling a soccer ball, nothing behind him but gaunt-looking cows and green hills. Nahil had started supporting Miguel when she was in law school. For eleven years now Nahil's checks had quietly crossed paths with Miguel's pictures and his thankful, nun-translated letters.</div>

She hopes that his return home was safe and that his family is well. It has been raining "angrily" in Kabul, she writes, and the streets are packed with mud up to the ankles. The rain has caused flooding, and some two hundred families had to be evacuated by helicopter in Shomali, north of Kabul.

<div class="line_en">On Monday, a pile of phone messages greets him when he enters his office. Prescription-refill requests spill from a basket, awaiting his approval. He has over one hundred and sixty e-mails to sift through, and his voice mail is full. He peruses his schedule on the computer and is dismayed to see overbooks -- squeezes, as the doctors call them -- inserted into his time slots all week. Worse, he will see the dreaded Mrs. Rasmussen that afternoon, a particularly unpleasant, confrontational woman with years of vague symptoms that respond to no treatment. The thought of facing her hostile neediness makes him break into a sweat. And last, one of the voice mails is from his chief, Joan Schaeffer, who tells him that a patient he had diagnosed with pneumonia just before his trip to Kabul turned out to have congestive heart failure instead. The case will be used next week for Peer Review, a monthly video conference watched by all the facilities during which mistakes by physicians, who remain anonymous, are used to illustrate learning points. The anonymity doesn't go very far, Idris knows. At least half the people in the room will know the culprit.</div>

<div class="line_en">He falls woefully behind schedule that morning. An asthma patient walks in without an appointment and needs respiratory treatments and close monitoring of his peak flows and oxygen saturation. A middle-aged executive, whom Idris last saw three years before, comes in with an evolving anterior myocardial infarction. Idris cannot start lunch until halfway through the noon hour. In the conference room where the doctors eat, he takes harried bites of a dry turkey sandwich as he tries to catch up with notes. He answers the same questions from his colleagues. Was Kabul safe? What do Afghans there think of the U. S. presence? He gives economical, clipped replies, his mind on Mrs. Rasmussen, on voice mails that need answering, refills he has yet to approve, the three squeezes in his schedule that afternoon, the upcoming Peer Review, the contractors sawing and drilling and banging nails back at the house. Talking about Afghanistan -- and he is astonished at how quickly and imperceptibly this has happened -- suddenly feels like discussing a recently watched, emotionally drenching film whose effects are beginning to wane.</div>

He receives two more e-mails from Amra, more updates on the conditions in Kabul. Rabia Balkhi, the women's hospital, has reopened. Karzai's cabinet will allow cable television networks to broadcast programs, challenging the Islamic hard-liners who had opposed it. In a postscript at the end of the second e-mail, she says that Roshi has become withdrawn since he left, and asks again whether he has spoken to his chief. He steps away from the keyboard.

The distance between him and the girl feels vast now. It feels infinite, insurmountable, and his promise to her misguided, a reckless mistake, a terrible misreading of the measures of his own powers and will and character. Something best forgotten.

<div class="line_en">He opens the book again, flips past the acknowledgments, past the bio of the coauthor, who has done the actual writing. He looks again at the photo on the book flap. There is no sign of the injury. If she bears a scar, which she must, the long, wavy black hair conceals it. Roshi is wearing a blouse with little gold beads, an Allah necklace, lapis ear studs. She is leaning against a tree, looking straight at the camera, smiling. He thinks of the stick figures she had drawn him. Don't go. Don't leave, Kaka. He does not detect in this young woman even a scrap of the tremulous little creature he had found behind a curtain six years before.</div>

<div class="line_en">The line moves. The woman with the short blond hair gets her book signed. She moves aside, and Idris, heart stammering, steps forward. Roshi looks up. She is wearing an Afghan shawl over a pumpkin-colored long-sleeved blouse and little oval-shaped silver earrings. Her eyes are darker than he remembers, and her body is filling out with female curves. She looks at him without blinking, and though she gives no overt indication that she has recognized him, and though her smile is polite, there is something amused and distant about her expression, playful, sly, unintimidated. It steam-rolls him, and suddenly all the words that he had composed -- even written down, rehearsed in his head on the way here -- dry up. He cannot bring himself to say a thing. He can only stand there, looking vaguely foolish.</div>

<div class="line_en">The book. Idris looks down, finds it clutched tightly in his hands. He has not come here to get it signed, of course. That would be galling -- grotesquely galling -- after everything. Still, he sees himself handing it over, the salesclerk expertly flipping to the correct page, Roshi's hand scrawling something beneath the title. He has seconds left now to say something, not that it would mitigate the indefensible but because he thinks he owes it to her. But when the clerk hands him back his book, he cannot summon the words. He wishes now for even a scrap of Timur's courage. He looks again at Roshi. She is already gazing past him at the next person in line.</div>

<div class="line_en">He closes the book, his eyes too. He supposes he should be relieved. But part of him wishes for something else. Perhaps if she had grimaced at him, said something infantile, full of loathing and hate. An eruption of rancor. Perhaps that might have been better. Instead, a clean, diplomatic dismissal. And this note. Don't worry. You're not in it. An act of kindness. Perhaps, more accurately, an act of charity. He should be relieved. But it hurts. He feels the blow of it, like an ax to the head.</div>
