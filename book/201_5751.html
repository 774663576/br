<div class="line_en">For or the rest of the week's Potions lessons Harry continued to follow the Half-Blood Prince's instructions wherever they deviated from Libatius Borage's, with the result that by their fourth lesson Slughorn was raving about Harrys abilities, saying that he had rarely taught anyone so talented. Neither Ron nor Hermione was delighted by this. Although Harry had offered to share his book with both of them, Ron had more difficulty deciphering the handwriting than Harry did, and could not keep asking Harry to read aloud or it might look suspicious. Hermione, meanwhile, was resolutely plowing on with what she called the "official" instructions, but becoming increasingly bad-tempered as they yielded poorer results than the Prince's.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这星期后来几节魔药课上，每次混血王子对利巴修·波拉奇的课本提出异议，哈利就按混血王子的建议去做，结果在上第四节魔药课时，斯拉格霍恩对哈利的能力赞不绝口，说他很少教过这么有天分的学生。罗恩和赫敏对此都不太高兴。尽管哈利把他的书拿出来与他俩共享，但罗恩不能像哈利那么熟练地辨认那些字迹，又不能总是叫哈利念出声来给他听，免得惹人怀疑。赫敏呢，她毫不动摇地按照她所说的“正式”指南去操作，结果熬制出的魔药远不如按照王子的那些说明去操作的令人满意，所以她的脾气越来越坏。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry wondered vaguely who the Half-Blood Prince had been. Although the amount of homework they had been given prevented him from reading the whole of his copy of Advanced Potion-Making, he had skimmed through it sufficiently to see that there was barely a page on which the Prince had not made additional notes, not all of them concerned with potion-making. Here and there were directions for what looked like spells that the Prince had made up himself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利暗暗猜测这位混血王子到底是什么人。由于家庭作业太多，他还没能把那本《高级魔药制作》仔细研读一遍，但他已经从头到尾大致翻了翻，发现王子几乎在每一页上都添加了笔记，而且那些笔记并不都与魔药制作有关。有一些说明看上去像是王子自己编的咒语。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“说不定那是个女人呢，”一个星期六的晚上，赫敏在公共休息室里听哈利把那些咒语说给罗恩听的时候，不耐烦地说，“也可能是个女生。我觉得那笔记不像男生的，更像女生的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, that can't be right," she said, annoyed, and Harry heard her reshuffling vigorously as she set off again, leaving nothing but a whiff of cooking sherry behind her.

<div class="line_cn" title="“唉，这肯定不对。”她烦恼地说，哈利听见她一边起劲地重新洗牌，一边又往前走去，只在身后留下一股雪利料酒的气味。哈利一直等到确信她已经走远，才赶紧拔腿离开雕像，一直走到八楼走廊里有只单独的石头怪兽的地方。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“酸味汽水。”哈利说。石头怪兽跳到一旁，它身后的墙壁裂成了两半，露出后面的一道活动的螺旋型楼梯。哈利跨了上去，随着楼梯一圈圈地旋转，越升越高，最后来到了那扇带有黄铜门环的邓布利多办公室门前。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Right," said Harry, who had more pressing matters on his mind than Snapes detention, and now looked around surreptitiously for some indication of what Dumbledore was planning to do with him this evening. The circular office looked just as it always did; the delicate silver instruments stood on spindle-legged tables, puff-ing smoke and whirring; portraits of previous headmasters and headmistresses dozed in their frames, and Dumbledore's magnificent phoenix, Fawkes, stood on his perch behind the door, watching Harry with bright interest. It did not even look as though Dumbledore had cleared a space for dueling practice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好的。”哈利说，他脑子里装着更要紧的事情，顾不上去想斯内普的禁闭。他偷偷打量着四周，想猜出邓布利多这个晚上叫他来做什么。这间圆形办公室看上去还和往常一样：细长腿的桌子上摆着许多精致的银器，它们旋转着，喷出一小股一小股的烟雾。那些男男女女老校长们的肖像都在各自的相框里打着瞌睡。邓布利多那只气派非凡的凤凰福克斯站在门后的栖枝上，兴趣盎然地注视着哈利。看样子，邓布利多并没有腾出一个练习格斗的地方。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry had indeed been eyeing the Pensieve with some apprehension. His previous experiences with the odd device that stored and revealed thoughts and memories, though highly instructive, had also been uncomfortable. The last time he had disturbed its contents, he had seen much more than he would have wished. But Dumbledore was smiling.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="确实，哈利是以担忧害怕的目光打量着冥想盆的。对于这个储藏和展现思想和记忆的古怪器物，他以前有过的几次经历虽然颇有启发性，但是都很不舒服。比如，他上次擅自闯进去时，就看到了许多他不愿意看到的东西。不过，邓布利多脸上带着微笑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They were standing in a country lane bordered by high, tangled hedgerows, beneath a summer sky as bright and blue as a forget-me-not. Some ten feet in front of them stood a short, plump man wearing enormously thick glasses that reduced his eyes to molelike specks. He was reading a wooden signpost that was sticking out of the brambles on the left-hand side of the road. Harry knew this must be Ogden; he was the only person in sight, and he was also wearing the strange assortment of clothes so often chosen by inexperienced wizards trying to look like Muggles: in this case, a frock coat and spats over a striped one-piece bathing costume. Before Harry had time to do more than register his bizarre appearance, however, Ogden had set off at a brisk walk down the lane.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们站在一条乡间小路上，两边都是高高的、枝叶纠结的灌木树篱，头顶上是夏日的天空，像勿忘我花一样清澈、湛蓝。在他们前面大约十步远的地方，站着一个矮矮胖胖的男人，他戴着一副镜片特别厚的眼镜，两只眼睛被缩小成了两个点，像鼹鼠的眼睛一样。他在阅读从小路左边的荆棘丛里伸出来的一根木头路标。哈利知道这一定就是奥格登了，因为四下里看不见别人，而且他跟那些想打扮成麻瓜模样、却又经验不足的巫师一样，穿着一身古里古怪的衣服：一件带条纹的游泳衣外面披了一件礼服大衣，脚上还套着鞋罩。哈利刚打量完他古怪的模样，奥格登就顺着小路快步走去了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They walked a short way with nothing to see but the hedgerows, the wide blue sky overhead and the swishing, frock-coated figure ahead. Then the lane curved to the left and fell away, sloping steeply down a hillside, so that they had a sudden, unexpected view of a whole valley laid out in front of them. Harry could see a village, undoubtedly Little Hangleton, nestled between two steep hills, its church and graveyard clearly visible. Across the valley, set on the opposite hillside, was a handsome manor house surrounded by a wide expanse of velvety green lawn.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们走了一会儿，周围看不见别的，只看到两边高高的灌木树篱、头顶上湛蓝辽阔的夏日天空和前面那个穿着礼服大衣、沙沙行走的身影。接着，小路向左一拐，顺着山坡陡直而下，于是，他们突然意外地发现一座山谷，一览无遗地呈现在他们面前。哈利看见了一个村庄，那无疑便是小汉格顿了，坐落在两座陡峭的山坡之间，教堂和墓地都清晰可见。山谷对面的山坡上，有一座非常气派的大宅子，周围是大片绿茵茵的草地。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dumbledore and Harry followed. As they passed the wooden sign, Harry looked up at its two arms. The one pointing back the way they had come read: Great Hangleton, 5 miles. The arm pointing after Ogden said Little Hangleton, 1 mile.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="邓布利多和哈利跟了上去。经过那根木头路标时，哈利抬头看了看它的两个指示箭头。指着他们来路的那个写着：大汉格顿，5英里。指着奥格登所去的方向写着：小汉格顿，1英里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dumbledore and Harry followed him onto a narrow dirt track bordered by higher and wilder hedgerows than those they had left behind. The path was crooked, rocky, and potholed, sloping down-hill like the last one, and it seemed to be heading for a patch of dark trees a little below them. Sure enough, the track soon opened up at the copse, and Dumbledore and Harry came to a halt behind Ogden, who had stopped and drawn his wand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="邓布利多和哈利跟着他来到一条狭窄的土路上，两边的灌木树篱比刚才他们经过的那些更加高大茂密。土路弯弯曲曲，坑坑洼洼，布满乱石，像刚才那条小路一样陡直向下，似乎通向下面一小片漆黑的树林。果然，没走多远，土路就接上了那片矮树林，奥格登停下脚步，拔出魔杖，邓布利多和哈利也在他身后停了下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Despite the cloudless sky, the old trees ahead cast deep, dark, cool shadows, and it was a few seconds before Harry's eyes discerned the building half-hidden amongst the tangle of trunks. It seemed to him a very strange location to choose for a house, or else an odd decision to leave the trees growing nearby, blocking all light and the view of the valley below. He wondered whether it was inhabited; its walls were mossy and so many tiles had fallen off the roof that the rafters were visible in places. Nettles grew all around it, their tips reaching the windows, which were tiny and thick with grime. Just as he had concluded that nobody could possibly live there, however, one of the windows was thrown open with a clatter, and a thin trickle of steam or smoke issued from it, as though somebody was cooking.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尽管天空晴朗无云，但头顶上那些古树投下了凉飕飕的黑暗浓密的阴影，过了几秒钟，哈利的眼睛才看见一座在盘根错节的树丛中半隐半现的房子。他觉得挑这个地方造房子真是有些奇怪，或者说，让那些大树长在房子旁边真是个古怪的决定，树木挡住了所有的光线，也挡住了下面的山谷。他琢磨着这个地方是不是有人居住：墙上布满苔藓，房顶上的许多瓦片都掉了，这里或那里露出了里面的椽木。房子周围长着茂密的荨麻，高高的荨麻一直齐到窗口，那些窗户非常小，积满了厚厚的陈年污垢。哈利正要断定不会有人住在里面，突然，咔哒一声，一扇窗户打开了，从里面冒出一股细细的蒸气或青烟，似乎有人正在烧饭。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ogden had broken into a reluctant trot due to the steep downward slope. Dumbledore lengthened his stride, and Harry hurried to keep up. He thought Little Hangleton must be their final destination and wondered, as he had done on the night they had found Slughorn, why they had to approach it from such a distance. He soon discovered that he was mistaken in thinking that they were going to the village, however. The lane curved to the right and when they rounded the corner, it was to see the very edge of Ogden's frock coat vanishing through a gap in the hedge.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="由于下坡的路太陡，奥格登不由自主地小跑起来。邓布利多把步子迈得更大，哈利也加快脚步跟在后面。他以为小汉格顿肯定是他们最终的目的地，所以，他就像他们去找斯拉格霍恩的那天夜里一样，心里纳闷为什么要从这么远的距离走过去。很快他就发现自己弄错了，他们并不是要去那个村庄。小路往右一拐，等他们转过那个弯道，只见奥格登礼服大衣的衣摆一闪，他在篱笆中的一个豁口处不见了。">查看中文翻译</div>

"Marvolo, his son, Morfin, and his daughter, Merope, were the last of the Gaunts, a very ancient Wizarding family noted for a vein of instability and violence that flourished through the generations due to their habit of marrying their own cousins. Lack of sense coupled with a great liking for grandeur meant that the family gold was squandered several generations before Marvolo was born. He, as you saw, was left in squalor and poverty, with a very nasty temper, a fantastic amount of arrogance and pride, and a couple of family heirlooms that he treasured just as much as his son, and rather more than his daughter."</div>

You can imagine the gossip it caused when the squire's son ran off with the tramp's daughter, Merope."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“很好。我个人倾向于她使用了迷情剂。我相信她会觉得那样更加浪漫，而且操作起来也不太困难。某个炎热的日子，里德尔独自骑马过来，梅洛普劝他喝了一杯水。总之，在刚才我们目睹的那一幕的几个月后，小汉格顿村爆出了一个惊人的丑闻。你可以想象，当人们听说乡绅的儿子跟流浪汉的女儿梅洛普一起私奔的消息后，会怎样议论纷纷啊。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But the villagers' shock was nothing to Marvolo's. He returned from Azkaban, expecting to find his daughter dutifully awaiting his return with a hot meal ready on his table. Instead, he found a clear inch of dust and her note of farewell, explaining what she had done."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可是跟马沃罗感到的震惊相比，村民们的惊讶就不算什么了。马沃罗从阿兹卡班回来时，本以为会看到女儿乖乖地等着他，桌上摆着热气腾腾的饭菜。他没想到屋里的灰尘积了一寸多厚，女儿留了一张诀别的纸条，上面写了她所干的事情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"From all that I have been able to discover, he never mentioned her name or existence from that time forth. The shock of her desertion may have contributed to his early death -- or perhaps he had simply never learned to feed himself. Azkaban had greatly weakened Marvolo, and he did not live to see Morfin return to the cottage."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“从我所能发掘的情况来看，从那以后，他再也没有提到过女儿的名字，或提到过女儿的存在。女儿弃家出走给他带来的震惊，大概是他过早去世的一个原因——或者，他大概一直没有学会怎么弄饭给自己吃。阿兹卡班搞垮了马沃罗的身体，他没有活着看到莫芬回到那座小木屋。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes, indeed," said Dumbledore. "We must do a certain amount of guessing here, although I do not think it is difficult to deduce what happened. You see, within a few months of their runaway marriage, Tom Riddle reappeared at the manor house in Little Hangleton without his wife. The rumor flew around the neighborhood that he was talking of being 'hoodwinked' and 'taken in.' What he meant, I am sure, is that he had been under an enchantment that had now lifted, though I daresay he did not dare use those precise words for fear of being thought insane. When they heard what he was saying, however, the villagers guessed that Merope had lied to Tom Riddle, pretending that she was going to have his baby, and that he had married her for this reason."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是啊，没错，”邓布利多说，“这里我们必须做一些猜测，不过我认为不难推断出后来发生的事情。是这样，他们私奔结婚的几个月之后，汤姆·里德尔又回到了小汉格顿的大宅子里，但身边并没有带着他的妻子。邻居们纷纷传言，说他一口咬定自己是被‘欺骗’和被‘蒙蔽’了。我想，他的意思一定是说他中了魔法，现在魔法已经解除了，但我相信他肯定不敢使用这样的字眼，以免别人把他看成疯子。不过，村民们听了他的话，都猜想是梅洛普对汤姆·里德尔撒了谎，假装说她就要为他生孩子了，逼得他只好娶了她。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Again, this is guesswork," said Dumbledore, "but I believe that Merope, who was deeply in love with her husband, could not bear to continue enslaving him by magical means. I believe that she made the choice to stop giving him the potion. Perhaps, besotted as she was, she had convinced herself that he would by now have fallen in love with her in return. Perhaps she thought he would stay for the baby's sake. If so, she was wrong on both counts. He left her, never saw her again, and never troubled to discover what became of his son."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这又只能凭猜测了。”邓布利多说，“我认为，梅洛普深深地爱着她的丈夫，她不能忍受继续靠魔法手段把他控制在手心里。我想，她做出了一个决定，不再给他服用迷情剂。也许，她是由于自己爱得太痴迷，便相信丈夫也会反过来爱上她。也许，她以为丈夫会为了孩子的缘故留下来。如果真是这样，她的这两个打算都落空了。汤姆·里德尔离开了她，从此再也没有见过她，也没有费心去打听他的儿子怎么样了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
