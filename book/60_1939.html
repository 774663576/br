<div class="line_en">All the way Tereza brooded about the photograph showing her naked body embracing the engineer. She tried to console herself with the thought that even if the picture did exist, Tomas would never see it. The only value it had for them was as a blackmailing device. It would lose that value the moment they sent it to Tomas.</div>

<div class="line_en">What would happen if Tomas were to receive such a picture? Would he throw her out? Perhaps not. Probably not. But the fragile edifice of their love would certainly come tumbling down. For that edifice rested on the single column of her fidelity, and loves are like empires: when the idea they are founded on crumbles, they, too, fade away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="托马斯收到那样一张照片会怎么样呢？他会拿出来吗？可能不会。很可能不会。但是，他们脆弱的爱情大厦会彻底坍塌，因为这座大厦仅仅建立在她的忠贞这惟一一根柱子之上。爱情就像是帝国：它们建立在信念之上，信念一旦消失，帝国也随之灭亡。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And now she had an image before her eyes: a rabbit scampering along a furrow, a hunter with a green cap, and the belfry of a village church rising up over the woods.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她眼前出现了一幅画面：在田间奔跑的野兔，戴着绿毡帽的猎场看守，还有树林上方教堂的钟楼。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But what if the police decided somewhere along the way that they couldn't use her? Then the picture would become a mere plaything in their hands, and nothing would prevent them from slipping it in an envelope and sending it off to Tomas.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，如果那些警察发现特蕾莎对他们没有任何用处，事情会怎么样呢？那样的话，那张照片对他们来讲就是个上好的玩笑。万一有人心血来潮，那谁也阻止不了他把照片装进信封，寄给托马斯。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Her stomach was in knots, and she thought she was going to be sick. She was afraid of Tomas. He was too strong for her; she was too weak. He gave her commands that she could not understand; she tried to carry them out, but did not know how.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她的胃在痉挛，她想吐。托马斯让她害怕。对她来说，他太强，而她太弱。他下达的总是些她不明白的命令。她虽然尽力去执行，却不知道该怎么下手。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She wanted to tell Tomas that they should leave Prague. Leave the children who bury crows alive in the ground, leave the police spies, leave the young women armed with umbrellas. She wanted to tell him that they should move to the country. That it was their only path to salvation.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她想对托马斯说他们应该离开布拉格。离开活埋乌鸦的儿童，离开警察，离开把雨伞当作武器的姑娘，全离得远远的。她想对他说他们应该到乡下去住。对他说这是他们惟一的生路。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She turned to him. But Tomas did not respond. He kept his eyes on the road ahead. Having thus failed to scale the fence of silence between them, she lost all courage to speak. She felt as she had felt when walking down Petrin Hill.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她朝他转过头。但是托马斯没吭声，眼睛直盯着前方的碎石路面。她无法超越他们之间耸立的这道沉默的屏障。她失去了开口的勇气。她完全处于那天从彼得山上下来时所处的状态之中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She wanted to go back to Petrin Hill and ask the man with the rifle to wind the blindfold around her eyes and let her lean against the trunk of the chestnut tree. She wanted to die.</div>
