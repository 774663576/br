<div class="line_en">Saint-Exupery was a fighter pilot who fought against the Nazis and was killed in action. Before World War II, he fought in the Spanish Civil War against the fascists. He wrote a fascinating story based on that experience entitled The Smile. It is this story which I'd like to share with you now. It isn't clear whether or not he meant this to be autobiographical or fiction. I choose to believe it to be the former.</div>

<div class="line_en">Many Americans are familiar with The Little Prince, a wonderful book by Antoine de Saint-Exupery. This is a whimsical and fabulous book and works as a children's story as well as a thought-provoking adult fable. Far fewer are aware of Saint-Exupery's other writings, novels and short stories.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="法国作家安东尼·德·圣埃克絮佩里所著的《小王子》是本很多美国人都熟悉的极好的书。这本书表面上看来是童话故事，但世故的成人读来也觉寓意深远。很少有人知道，除了《小王子》，圣埃克絮佩里还创作过其他小说和短篇故事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He said that he was captured by the enemy and thrown into a jail cell. He was sure that from the contemptuous looks and rough treatment he received from his jailers he would be executed the next day. From here, I'll tell the story as I remember it in my own words.</div>

<div class="line_en">"As he came close and lit the match, his eyes inadvertently locked with mine. At that moment, I smiled. I don't know why I did that. Perhaps it was nervousness, perhaps it was because, when you get very close, one to another, it is very hard not to smile. In any case, I smiled. In that instant, it was as though a spark jumped across the gap between our two hearts, our two human souls. I know he didn't want to, but my smile leaped through the bars and generated a smile on his lips, too. He lit my cigarette but stayed near, looking at me directly in the eyes and continuing to smile.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“当他帮我点火时，他的眼光无意中与我相接触。这一刻，我微笑了一下。我不知道自己为什么会笑。也许是过于紧张，或者是当你如此靠近另一个人，你很难不对他微笑。不管是何理由，我对他笑了一下。就在这一刹那，这抹微笑如同一粒火星般，打破了我们心灵间的鸿沟。我知道他并不想这样，但我的微笑越过了牢房的铁栅栏，他的嘴角不自觉地也现出了笑容。点完火后他并没立刻离开，而是两眼盯着我瞧，脸上仍带着微笑。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I looked through the bars at my jailer. He did not make eye contact with me. After all, one does not make eye contact with a thing, a corpse. I called out to him 'Have you got a light?' He looked at me, shrugged and came over to light my cigarette.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我透过铁栅栏望着狱卒。他并没有注意到我在看他。毕竟，我只是他看守的一样‘物品’、一具‘尸体’。我叫了他一声，‘能跟你借个火吗？’他转头望着我，耸了耸肩，然后走了过来，点燃我的香烟。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I was sure that I was to be killed. I became terribly nervous and distraught. I fumbled in my pockets to see if there were any cigarettes, which had escaped their search. I found one and because of my shaking hands, I could barely get it to my lips. But I had no matches, they had taken those.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Suddenly, without another word, he unlocked my cell and silently led me out. Out of the jail, quietly and by back routes, out of the town. There, at the edge of town, he released me. And without another word, he turned back toward the town.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“突然间，他二话不说地打开了牢门，悄悄地带我从后面的小路逃离了监狱，出了小镇，就在小镇的边上，他放了我，之后头也不回地转身走了，不曾留下一句话。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"'Yes, here, here.' I took out my wallet and nervously fumbled for the pictures of my family. He, too, took out the pictures of his family and began to talk about his plans and hopes for them. My eyes filled with tears. I said that I feared that I'd never see my family again, never have the chance to see them grow up. Tears came to his eyes, too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“‘有，你看。’我拿出了皮夹，手忙脚乱地翻出了我的全家福照片。他也掏出了照片，并且开始讲述他对家人的期望与计划。这时我眼中充满了泪水，我说我怕再也见不到家人了。我害怕没机会看着孩子长大。他听了也热泪盈眶。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Yes, the smile is the unaffected, unplanned, natural connection between people. I tell this story in my work because I'd like people to consider that underneath all the layers we construct to protect ourselves, our dignity, our titles, our degrees, our status and our need to be seen in certain ways -- underneath all that remains the authentic, essential self. I'm not afraid to call it the soul. I really believe that if that part of you and that part of me could recognize each other, we wouldn't be enemies. We couldn't have hate or envy or fear. I sadly conclude that all those other layers, which we so carefully construct through our lives, distance and insulate us from truly contacting others. Saint-Exupery's story speaks of that magic moment when two souls recognize each other.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="是的，微笑是人与人之间最自然真挚的沟通方式。我在我的作品中讲这个故事，因为我希望人们能仔细想想以下的事情：人常常为自己建立层层保护膜，为了维护尊严、头街、身份、形象等，而必须有所隐藏。我相信在这些掩饰下，每个人都有一个真实、不虚伪的灵魂。如果我们能用心灵去认识彼此，世间不会有结怨成仇的憾事。仇恨、妒嫉、恐惧也会不复存在。遗憾的是：人小心翼翼为自己所建造的保护膜，却阻隔了自己与他人真诚相对的机会。圣埃克絮佩里的这则故事，让我们见到了两颗心灵相互交流的神奇时刻。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I've had just a few moments like that. Falling in love is one example. And looking at a baby. Why do we smile when we see a baby? Perhaps it's because we see someone without all the defensive layers, someone whose smile for us we know to be fully genuine and without guile. And that baby-soul inside us smiles wistfully in recognition.</div>
