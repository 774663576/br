<div class="line_en">Hans and Rosa, both steeped in the despair of the predicament, made no argument, not even in regard to the cold. They heaved blankets down and topped up the kerosene lamp. Rosa admitted that there could not be much food, to which Max fervently asked her to bring only scraps, and only when they were not wanted by anyone else.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="汉斯和罗莎都沉浸在自身绝望的处境中，没有提出异议，甚至没有提到地下室的寒冷。他们把毯子搬下去，给煤油灯灌上燃料。罗莎坦白地说，吃的东西不会很充足，马克斯赶忙说，他吃没人吃的剩饭就行。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They also took the mattress down, from the spare bed in Liesel's room, replacing it with drop sheets -- an excellent trade.</div>

<div class="line_en">He rationalized that he was so bewildered upon his arrival that he allowed such a thing. The basement was the only place for him as far as he was concerned. Forget the cold and the loneliness. He was a Jew, and if there was one place he was destined to exist, it was a basement or any other such hidden venue of survival.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他是这么为自己辩解的，那天他刚刚抵达，整个人都不知所措，才使得这样的事情发生。地下室才是他唯一的归宿，不管那里多么孤独和寒冷。他是个犹太人，如果他有什么注定的去处，必然是地下室或者这类隐蔽的求生之地。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">With some well-positioned paint cans, Hans actually conceded that it did simply look like a collection of junk gathered sloppily in the corner, out of the way. The one problem was that a person needed only to shift a few cans and remove a drop sheet or two to smell out the Jew.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="汉斯又巧妙地摆上了几个油漆罐，此时这个临时寓所看起来的确像个随意堆在角落里的垃圾堆。问题是任何人只要拿走几个罐子，拉开一两块防尘布，就能发现里面的犹太人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Downstairs, Hans and Max placed the mattress beneath the steps and built a wall of drop sheets at the side. The sheets were high enough to cover the whole triangular entrance, and if nothing else, they were easily moved if Max was in dire need of extra air.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="汉斯和马克斯把床垫搬到台阶下，在床垫周围用防尘布竖起了三面墙。防尘布足够长，能把三角形的入口遮得严严实实。如果马克斯想出来透口气，光凭自己的力量也能轻松地把它们挪走。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She made her way quietly down the hallway and into the living and bedroom.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她安静地穿过走廊来到起居室，那也是马克斯的卧室。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The fire was nothing now but a funeral of smoke, dead and dying, simultaneously. On this particular morning, there were also voices.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="炉火已经燃烧殆尽，只余下一场烟的葬礼，火已经死亡，烟即将死去。在这个特别的凌晨，房子里流淌着两种声音。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Max?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“马克斯？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">To begin with, there was no sound of reply, but he soon sat up and searched the darkness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一开始没有任何回答，但他很快坐起身，在黑暗中摸索。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The whisper was soft, clouded in the throat of sleep.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她睡眼惺忪，发出朦胧的低语。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">With Papa still in her bedroom, Liesel sat on the other side of the fireplace from Max. Behind them, Mama loudly slept. She gave the snorer on the train a good run for her money.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爸爸还在莉泽尔的房间里睡觉，女孩和马克斯分别坐在炉火两侧。妈妈的鼾声很大。她折腾出来的声响和火车上那个打鼾的女人不相上下。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It would be nice to say that after this small breakthrough, neither Liesel nor Max dreamed their bad visions again. It would be nice but untrue. The nightmares arrived like they always did, much like the best player in the opposition when you've heard rumors that he might be injured or sick -- but there he is, warming up with the rest of them, ready to take the field. Or like a timetabled train, arriving at a nightly platform, pulling the memories behind it on a rope. A lot of dragging. A lot of awkward bounces.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果说在这个小小的突破之后，他们俩再也不做噩梦了，那将是何等的好事。可这件好事并没有变成现实。噩梦还是像往日那样不请自到，就好比听说你最强的对手受伤或者生病了，但忽然发现他出现在比赛现场，与其他人一起做热身运动，准备上场。噩梦还像一列在夜间抵达的列车，停靠在黑暗的站台旁，车头后面用绳索连着一长串记忆，它们彼此碰撞，颠簸不已。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, thank God." He halfway grinned. "At least now I can get some proper sleep. That chair was killing me." He put his arm around the girl and they walked to the kitchen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“太棒了，感谢上帝，”他勉强笑了笑，“至少我现在能睡个好觉了。那张椅子可把我折磨得够呛。”他伸手搂住女孩，他们一同走进厨房。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As time progressed, a clear distinction developed between two very different worlds -- the world inside 33 Himmel Street, and the one that resided and turned outside it. The trick was to keep them apart.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="随着时间的流逝，希默尔街上呈现出两个截然不同的世界，一个位于三十三号里面，另一个则在它的外面。划分两个世界的诀窍就是让它们泾渭分明。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the outside world, Liesel was learning to find some more of its uses. One afternoon, when she was walking home with an empty washing bag, she noticed a newspaper poking out of a garbage can. The weekly edition of the Molching Express. She lifted it out and took it home, presenting it to Max. "I thought," she told him, "you might like to do the crossword to pass the time."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莉泽尔正渐渐学会怎样更好地利用外面的世界。一天下午，她提着空空的洗衣袋走在回家的路上，注意到一个垃圾桶上冒出了一份报纸。那是一份周刊《莫尔辛快报》。她捡起报纸带回家，拿给马克斯看。“我觉得，”她告诉他，“你可能想做点填字游戏打发时间。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The only thing that changed was that Liesel told her papa that she should be old enough now to cope on her own with the dreams. For a moment, he looked a little hurt, but as always with Papa, he gave the right thing to say his best shot.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="唯一的变化是，莉泽尔告诉爸爸她已经长大了，可以独自应对那些噩梦。听到这些话时，爸爸有种受伤的感觉，但他总是明白在这种场合该如何回答才最恰当。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Max appreciated the gesture, and to justify her bringing it home, he read the paper from cover to cover and showed her the puzzle a few hours later, completed but for one word.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="马克斯很感激她，为了不让这份好意白费，他用几个小时从头读到尾，并把填字游戏拿给她看，他全部填好了，只差一个词。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At first, he merely stood there, but as she held on to him, gradually his hands rose up and gently pressed into her shoulder blades.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="起先他只是静静地站着，可是随着她将他抱住，他的双手也渐渐抬起来，温柔地搭在她的肩上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Alles Gute zum Geburtstag." He smiled weakly. "All the best for your birthday." His hands were in his pockets. "I didn't know, or else I could have given you something." A blatant lie -- he had nothing to give, except maybe Mein Kampf, and there was no way he'd give such propaganda to a young German girl. That would be like the lamb handing a knife to the butcher.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“祝你生日快乐。”他的笑容很虚弱，“祝你生日快乐。”他把双手插在口袋里。“我真不知道，不然我也能送你点礼物。”真是公然说谎。他哪有什么礼物可送呢，也许《我的奋斗》除外，但是他怎能送这种东西给一个德国女孩，这就像绵羊把屠刀送到屠夫手里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Damn that seventeen down," he said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这个可恶的第十七列。”他说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She had embraced Mama and Papa.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她拥抱完妈妈和爸爸了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Only later would she find out about the helpless expression on Max Vandenburg's face. She would also discover that he resolved at that moment to give her something back. I often imagine him lying awake all that night, pondering what he could possibly offer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到了后来，她才读懂马克斯·范登堡脸上无助的表情。她还会发现，他正是在这一刻决心要给她一点回报。我常常会想象他整夜无眠地躺着，思索着自己到底能送她什么礼物的场景。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Max looked so alone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="马克斯显得十分孤独。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In February 1941, for her twelfth birthday, Liesel received another used book, and she was grateful. It was called The Mud Men and was about a very strange father and son. She hugged her mama and papa, while Max stood uncomfortably in the corner.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一九四一年二月，在莉泽尔十二岁生日那天，她又收到一本旧书，心里很是感恩。书名叫《泥人》，主人公是一对怪异的父子。她拥抱了妈妈和爸爸，马克斯则尴尬地站在角落里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And she walked over and hugged him for the first time. "Thanks, Max."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后，她走过去拥抱了他。“谢谢你，马克斯。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As it turned out, the gift was delivered on paper, just over a week later.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后，他把礼物呈现在了纸上，就在一个星期之后。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was an uncomfortable silence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一阵令人不安的沉默。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He would bring it to her in the early hours of morning, before retreating down the concrete steps to what he now liked to call home.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凌晨时分，在走下水泥台阶，回到他现在称作“家”的地方之前，他把礼物送给了她。">查看中文翻译</div>
