<div class="line_en">Gentlewomen of the jury! Bear with me! Allow me to take just a tiny bit of your precious time! So this was le grand moment. I had left my Lolita still sitting on the edge of the abysmal bed, drowsily raising her foot, fumbling at the shoelaces and showing as she did so the nether side of her thigh up to the crotch of her panties -- she had always been singularly absent-minded, or shameless, or both, in matters of legshow. This, then, was the hermetic vision of her which I had locked in -- after satisfying myself that the door carried no inside bolt. The key, with its numbered dangler of carved wood, became forthwith the weighty sesame to a rapturous and formidable future. It was mine, it was part of my hot hairy fist. In a few minutes -- say, twenty, say half-an-hour, sicher ist sicher as my uncle Gustave used to say -- I would let myself into that "342" and find my nymphet, my beauty and bride, emprisoned in her crystal sleep. Jurors! If my happiness could have talked, it would have filled that genteel hotel with a deafening roar. And my only regret today is that I did not quietly deposit key "342" at the office, and leave the town, the country, the continent, the hemisphere,-- indeed, the globe -- that very same night.</div>

<div class="line_en">Let me explain. I was not unduly disturbed by her self-accusatory innuendoes. I was still firmly resolved to pursue my policy of sparing her purity by operating only in the stealth of night, only upon a completely anesthetized little nude. Restraint and reverence were still my motto -- even if that "purity" (incidentally, thoroughly debunked by modern science) had been slightly damaged through some juvenile erotic experience, no doubt homosexual, at that accursed camp of hers. Of course, in my old-fashioned, old-world way, I, Jean-Jacques Humbert, had taken for granted, when I first met her, that she was as un-ravished as the stereotypical notion of "normal child" had been since the lamented end of the Ancient World B. C. and its fascinating practices. We are not surrounded in our enlighted era by little slave flowers that can be casually plucked between business and bath as they used to be in the days of the Romans; and we do not, as dignified Orientals did in still more luxurious times, use tiny entertainers fore and aft between the mutton and the rose sherbet. The whole point is that the old link between the adult world and the child world has been completely severed nowadays by new customs and new laws. Despite my having dabbled in psychiatry and social work, I really knew very little about children. After all, Lolita was only twelve, and no matter what concessions I made to time and place -- even bearing in mind the crude behavior of American schoolchildren -- I still was under the impression that whatever went on among those brash brats, went on at a later age, and in a different environment. Therefore (to retrieve the thread of this explanation) the moralist in me by-passed the issue by clinging to conventional notions of what twelve-year-old girls should be. The child therapist in me (a fake, as most of them are -- but no matter) regurgitated neo-Freudian hash and conjured up a dreaming and exaggerating Dolly in the "latency" period of girlhood. Finally, the sensualist in me (a great and insane monster) had no objection to some depravity in his prey. But somewhere behind the raging bliss, bewildered shadows conferred -- and not to have heeded them, this is what I regret! Human beings, attend! I should have understood that Lolita had already proved to be something quite different from innocent Annabel, and that the nymphean evil breathing through every pore of the fey child that I had prepared for my secret delectation, would make the secrecy impossible, and the delectation lethal. I should have known (by the signs made to me by something in Lolita -- the real child Lolita or some haggard angel behind her back) that nothing but pain and horror would result from the expected rapture.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="让我解释吧。我并末受到她的自供的过分干扰。我现在仍然坚定地要追求我的方针，趁黑夜只对那个已完全麻醉的小裸体进行秘密行动以不侵占她的贞洁。仰制和尊崇仍然是我的箴言—即使她的“贞洁”（顺便一提，它已被现代科学彻底驳斥了）已经被一些少年人的性经历，无疑是发生在她那该受控告的夏今营中的同性恋行为稍稍损坏了。当然，按我旧派老式的眼光，我，琼—雅克·亨伯特，应当承认初次见她时她并非那殷销魂，与那种自世纪前古代世界末日以来流行并付诸衡量标准的定型概念中的“正常孩子”并无殊异。在我们已受启蒙的时代，我们不象罗马人那样，四周没有幼小的奴隶之花可以随意在办公和洗澡时摘下；我们也不能象尊贵的东方人更骄奢的岁月里做过的雇用小优伶出现在羊肉与玫瑰露席间。总之成人与儿童世界之间古老的链条已经被今天的新风俗和新法律彻底切断。尽管我涉足精神病学和社会工作，我实际对儿童所知甚少。毕竟，洛丽塔才十二岁，并且无论我对时间和地点做了什么样的让步—甚至脑中铬记着美国学生不成熟的作为一一我始终以为不论在那些粗鲁的乳臭小儿中间发生了什么，都会在以后的日子里、一个不同的环境中再行发生。因此（回到这根解释的线上），我身任的道德家角色还是绕过这个问题转到十二岁女孩应该是什么样的传统观念上。我身任的儿童精神治疗家角色（一个伪装者，象大多数这类人一样—但没关系）又让后弗洛伊德杂拌菜反上胃来，并召遣来处于少女时代“潜伏期”的如梦、夸张的多丽。最后，我内心的感觉主义者（一个庞大失常的妖怪）对于他的捕物的某种邪恶并未产生异议。但在猛烈的冲动之后，迷乱的阴影袭来了—却未曾觉察，这是我所遗憾的！人类，注意啊！我应该明白洛丽塔已经表现出和天真的阿娜贝尔非常的不同、应该明白精灵的邪恶已经注人这个我预备秘密享用的疯狂的孩子的每一个毛孔，这些都必定会使秘密难保，并使享乐夺人性命。我应该知道（透过洛丽塔对我显现的特征—真正的孩子洛丽塔或她掩藏的某个野性的天使）我所期待的销魂除了痛苦和恐惧，便不会有其它结果。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And she was mine, she was mine, the key was in my fist, my fist was in my pocket, she was mine. In the course of the evocations and schemes to which I had dedicated so many insomnias, I had gradually eliminated all the superfluous blur, and by stacking level upon level of translucent vision, had evolved a final picture. Naked, except for one sock and her charm bracelet, spread-eagled on the bed where my philter had felled her -- so I foreglimpsed her; a velvet hair ribbon was still clutched in her hand; her honey-brown body, with the white negative image of a rudimentary swimsuit patterned against her tan, presented to me its pale breastbuds; in the rosy lamplight, a little pubic floss glistened on its plump hillock. The cold key with its warm wooden addendum was in my pocket.</div>

<div class="line_en">I drifted to the Men's Room. There, a person in clerical black -- a "hearty party" comme on dit -- checking with the assistance of Vienna, if it was still there, inquired of me how I had liked Dr. Boyd's talk, and looked puzzled when I (King Sigmund the Second) said Boyd was quite a boy. Upon which, I neatly chucked the tissue paper I had been wiping my sensitive finger tips with into the receptacle provided for it, and sallied lobby-ward. Comfortably resting my elbows on the counter, I asked Mr. Potts was he quite sure my wife had not telephoned, and what about that cot? He answered she had not (she was dead, of course) and the cot would be installed tomorrow if we decided to stay on. From a big crowded place called The Hunters' Hall came a sound of many voices discussing horticulture or eternity. Another room, called The Raspberry Room, all bathed in light, with bright little tables and a large one with "refreshments," was still empty except for a hostess (that type of worn woman with a glassy smile and Charlotte's manner of speaking); she floated up to me to ask if I was Mr. Braddock, because if so, Miss Beard had been looking for me. "What a name for a woman," I said and strolled away.</div>

<div class="line_en">In and out of my heart flowed my rainbow blood. I would give her till half-past-nine. Going back to the lobby, I found there a change: a number of people in floral dresses or black cloth had formed little groups here and there, and some elfish chance offered me the sight of a delightful child of Lolita's age, in Lolita's type of frock, but pure white, and there was a white ribbon in her black hair. She was not pretty, but she was a nymphet, and her ivory pale legs and lily neck formed for one memorable moment a most pleasurable antiphony (in terms of spinal music) to my desire for Lolita, brown and pink, flushed and fouled. The pale child noticed my gaze (which was really quite casual and debonair), and being ridiculously self-conscious, lost countenance completely, rolling her eyes and putting the back of her hand to her cheek, and pulling at the hem of her skirt, and finally turning her thin mobile shoulder blades to me in specious chat with her cow-like mother.</div>
