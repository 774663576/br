<div class="line_en">"Who?" he croaked. At least he had his voice back, raw and hoarse though it was. The fever was still on him, and Tyrion had no notion of the hour. How long had he slept this time? He was so weak, so damnably weak. "Who?" he called again, more loudly. Torchlight spilled through the open door, but within the chamber the only light came from the stub of a candle beside his bed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“谁？”他嘶声叫道。虽然声音生硬而嘶哑，但至少能说话了。提利昂仍旧发着高烧，完全失去了时间概念。睡了多久？他太虚弱，虚弱得不象话。“谁？”他再次叫喊，试图大声一些。火炬的光芒从敞开的大门外溢入，但在卧室里，唯一的光源只是床边一根快燃尽的蜡烛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tyrion's fingers went to the great gash that ran from above one eye down to his jaw, across what remained of his nose. The proud flesh was still raw and warm to the touch. "With a fearful big razor, yes."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Not dead. Though my sweet sister did try." Perhaps he should not have said that aloud, but Tyrion was past caring. Cersei was behind Ser Mandon's attempt to kill him, he knew that in his gut. "What's that ugly thing on your chest?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我才没死，没那么容易屈从于我亲爱的老姐。”也许不该说得这样大声，但提利昂懒得在意，他打心眼里清楚瑟曦是操纵曼登爵士的幕后黑手。“你胸前的破玩意儿是什么？”">查看中文翻译</div>

" He had liked that "by your lord father's command" not at all. Lord Tywin had wasted little time. Moving his son from the Tower of the Hand to claim it for himself was a message anyone could read, and this was another. "I lose half my nose and you gain a knighthood. The gods have a deal to answer for." His voice was sour. "Did my father dub you himself?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="提利昂用手撑着羽毛绒床垫，向后蠕动几寸，把头枕起来，“你才不要忘了，骑士身份是谁许下的！”他一点也不喜欢“蒙你父亲大人所赐”这句话。泰温公爵没有浪费一点时间，前脚把自己儿子从首相塔里扔出来，后脚便颁布册封，这是给所有人看的信息。“我丢了半个鼻子，你却当上骑士，诸神啊，这到底是怎么回事？”他酸酸地感叹，“我父亲亲自册封你的？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"During the battle. Your sister sent the Kettleblacks to fetch the king back to the Red Keep, the way I hear it. When the gold cloaks saw him leaving half of them decided they'd leave with him. Ironhand put himself in their path and tried to order them back to the walls. They say Bywater was blistering them good and almost had'em ready to turn when someone put an arrow through his neck. He didn't seem so fearsome then, so they dragged him off his horse and killed him."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“战斗正酣时，你姐姐忽命凯特布莱克们把国王接回红堡——反正我是这样听说的。金袍军看到国王离去，认为自己已遭抛弃，这时铁手挡在他们前面，命令他们返回岗位。大家都承认拜瓦特做得很好，他们几乎就要在他的激励下回头了，不料斜刺里飞来一箭，正中铁手颈项。中箭后的他看起来不那么可怕，所以被人们从马上拖下来，当场格杀。”">查看中文翻译</div>

I sent him to bring Ser jacelyn and he came back and told me he's dead."</div>

<div class="line_en">She was learning to read, Tyrion thought, absurdly. Across his face the scar stretched tight, and for a moment it felt as though his head would burst with rage. Alayaya was a whore, true enough, but a sweeter, braver, more innocent girl he had seldom met. Tyrion had never touched her; she had been no more than a veil, to hide Shae. In his carelessness, he had never thought what the role might cost her. "I promised my sister I would treat Tornmen as she treated Alayaya," he remembered aloud. He felt as though he might retch. "How can I scourge an eight-year-old boy?" But if I don't, Cersei wins.</div>

"From the winch towers, all we saw was banners in the mud and men throwing down their spears to run, but there's hundreds in the pot shops and brothels who'll tell you how they saw Lord Renly kill this one or that one. Most of Stannis's host had been Renly's to start, and they went right back over at the sight of him in that shiny green armor."</div>

<div class="line_en">"No. She's coming, though, and the city's mad with love for her. The Tyrells have been carting food up from Highgarden and giving it away in her name. Hundreds of wayns each day. There's thousands of Tyrell men swaggering about with little golden roses sewn on their doublets, and not a one is buying his own wine. Wife, widow, or whore, the women are all giving up their virtue to every peach-fuzz boy with a gold rose on his teat."</div>

<div class="line_en">They spit on me, and buy drinks for the Tyrells. Tyrion slid from the bed to the floor. His legs turned wobbly beneath him, the room spun, and he had to grasp Bronn's arm to keep from pitching headlong into the rushes. "Pod!" he shouted. "Podrick Payne! Where in the seven hells are you?" Pain gnawed at him like a toothless dog. Tyrion hated weakness, especially his own. It shamed him, and shame made him angry. "Pod, get in here!"</div>

Hideous though his face might be, the worst of his wounds was the one at the juncture of shoulder and arm, where his own mail had been driven back into his armpit by an arrow. Pus and blood still seeped from the discolored flesh whenever Maester Frenken changed his dressing, and any movement sent a stab of agony through him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="合三个人之力，他才穿好衣服。虽然脸上的伤十分可怕，但伤筋动骨的是肩臂结合部那一击，有一只箭曾插进腋窝里。平日，只要法兰肯学士为他更衣，血和脓就从褪色的血肉中渗出，稍微移动就牵起一阵贯穿全身的刺痛。">查看中文翻译</div>

The wine was sweetened with honey, with just enough of the poppy to make his wounds bearable for a time.</div>
