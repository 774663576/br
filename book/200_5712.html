<div class="line_en">Dumbledore's abrupt departure took Harry completely by surprise. He remained sitting where he was in the chained chair, struggling with his feelings of shock and relief. The Wizengamot were all getting to their feet, talking, gathering up their papers and packing them away. Harry stood up. Nobody seemed to be paying him the slightest bit of attention, except the toadlike witch on Fudge's right, who was now gazing down at him instead of at Dumbledore. Ignoring her, he tried to catch Fudge's eye, or Madam Bones's, wanting to ask whether he was free to go, but Fudge seemed quite determined not to notice Harry, and Madam Bones was busy with her briefcase, so he took a lew tentative steps towards the exit and, when nobody called him back, broke into a very fast walk.</div>

<div class="line_en">One or two of the wizards nodded to Harry as they passed and a few, including Madam Bones, said, "Morning, Arthur," to Mr. Weasley, but most averted their eyes. Cornelius Fudge and the toadlike witch were almost the last to leave the dungeon. Fudge acted as though Mr. Weasley and Harry were part of the wall, but again, the witch looked almost appraisingly at Harry as she passed. Last of all to pass was Percy. Like Fudge, he completely ignored his father and Harry; he marched past clutching a large roll of parchment and a handful of spare quills, his back rigid and his nose in the air. The lines around Mr. Weasley's mouth tightened slightly, but other than this he gave no sign that he had seen his third son.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一两个巫师走过时冲哈利点了点头，还有几个，包括博恩斯女士，对韦斯莱先生说：“早上好，亚瑟。”但大多数人都把眼睛望着别处。康奈利和那个癞蛤蟆样的女巫几乎是最后离开暗室的。福吉只当韦斯莱先生和哈利是墙壁的一部分，而那个女巫走过时，又一次用几乎是审视的耳光打量着哈利。最后走过的是珀西，他和福吉一样，完全无视他父亲和哈利的存在。他抓着一大卷羊皮纸和一大把备用的羽毛笔，背挺得直直的，鼻孔朝天，大步流星地走了过去。韦斯莱先生嘴巴周围的线条紧了一紧，但除此之外，他没有表露出见到他三儿子的任何迹象。">查看中文翻译</div>

Harry could not believe that Lucius Malfoy dared look him in the face; he could not believe that he was here, in the Ministry of Magic, or that Cornelius Fudge was talking to him, when Harry had told Fudge mere weeks ago that Malfoy was a Death Eater.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利突然觉得透不过气来，似乎他一脚跨进了某个凝固的东西里。他上次看见这两只冷冰冰的灰眼睛时，它们隐藏在食死徒兜帽的两道狭缝后面；他上次听见这个男人的声音，是在阴暗的墓地里发出的阵阵嘲笑，而当时伏地魔正在折磨他。哈利不敢相信卢修斯马尔福竟然还敢当面看着他，他不敢相信马尔福竟然出现在这里，在堂堂的魔法部，而康奈利福吉竟然在跟他说话，要知道哈利几个星期前曾亲口对福吉说过马尔福是个食死徒。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“照我看，他是想偷偷溜进审判室，”韦斯莱先生说，他显得十分心烦意乱，不住地扭头看看有没有人在偷听，“想弄清你到底是不是被开除了。我把你送回去时要给邓布利多留一个短信，他应该知道马尔福又在跟福吉嘀咕什么。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I don't think private matters between myself and the Minister are any concern of yours, Potter," said Malfoy, smoothing the front of his robes.

<div class="line_en">He looked up into the handsome wizard's face, but up close, Harry thought he looked rather weak and foolish. The witch was wearing a vapid smile like a beauty contestant, and from what Harry knew of goblins and centaurs, they were most unlikely to be caught staring so soppily at humans of any description. Only the house-elf's attitude of creeping servility looked convincing. With a grin at the thought of what Hermione would say if she could see the statue of the elf, Harry turned his moneybag upside-down and emptied not just ten Galleons, but the whole contents into the pool at the statues' feet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他抬头仔细端详着那位英俊的巫师的面孔，现在离得近了，哈利觉得他显得很柔弱，很愚蠢。那女巫脸上堆着一个空洞的笑容，像是在参加选美比赛，而且就哈利对妖精和马人的了解，他们绝不可能这样含情脉脉地仰望任何人。只有家养小精灵那副怯生生的奴隶般的神态还令人信服。不知赫敏看到这个小精灵的雕像会说什么。哈利想到这儿，脸上露出调皮的笑容，他把钱袋倒过来，不是数出十个加隆，而是把里面的钱都倒进了水潭。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He had forgotten completely about prefects being chosen in the fifth year. He had been too anxious about the possibility of being expelled to spare a thought for the fact that badges must be winging their way towards certain people. But if he had remembered… if he had thought about it… what would he have expected?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他已经把五年级要挑选级长的事忘得一于二净。他一直忧心忡忡地担心会被开除，根本没有心思去想徽章正扇动着翅膀朝某些人飞来。但如果他没有忘记…如果他曾经想过…他会希望有什么结果呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He leaned over his trunk, laid the robes on the bottom of it and pretended to be rummaging for something while Hermione crossed to the wardrobe and called Hedwig down. A few moments passed; Harry heard the door close but remained bent double, listening; the only sounds he could hear were the blank picture on the wall sniggering again and the wastepaper basket in the corner coughing up the owl droppings.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他弯腰俯在箱子上，把那堆衣服放在箱子底下，假装在里面翻找着什么，这时赫敏走到衣柜前唤海德薇下来。过了一会儿，哈利听见门关上了，但他仍然弯着腰，侧耳倾听，四下里没有别的声音，只有墙上那张空白的油画又在哧哧发笑，还有墙角的废纸篓在咳嗽，想把猫头鹰的粪便吐出来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He straightened up and looked behind him. Hermione had left and Hedwig had gone. Harry hurried across the room, closed the door, then returned slowly to his bed and sank on to it, gazing unseeingly at the foot of the wardrobe.</div>

Did he think himself superior to everyone else? Did he really believe he was better than Ron?</div>

<div class="line_en">It was odd how widely their possessions seemed to have scattered themselves since they had arrived. It took them most of the afternoon to retrieve their books and belongings from all over the house and stow them back inside their school trunks. Marry noticed that Ron kept moving his prefect's badge around, first placing it on his bedside table, then putting it into his jeans pocket, then taking it out and lying it on his folded robes, as though to see the effect of the red on the black. Only when Fred and George dropped in and offered to attach it to his forehead with a Permanent Sticking Charm did he wrap it tenderly in his maroon socks and lock it in his trunk.</div>
