<div class="line_en">We slog back to the train in silence. In the hallway outside my door, Haymitch gives my shoulder a pat and says, "You could do a lot worse, you know." He heads off to his compartment, taking the smell of wine with him.</div>

<div class="line_en">In my room, I remove my sodden slippers, my wet robe and pajamas. There are more in the drawers but I just crawl between the covers of my bed in my underclothes. I stare into the darkness, thinking about my conversation with Haymitch. Everything he said was true about the Capitol's expectations, my future with Peeta, even his last comment. Of course, I could do a lot worse than Peeta. That isn't really the point, though, is it? One of the few freedoms we have in District 12 is the right to marry who we want or not marry at all. And now even that has been taken away from me. I wonder if President Snow will insist we have children. If we do, they'll have to face the reaping each year. And wouldn't it be something to see the child of not one but two victors chosen for the arena? Victors' children have been in the ring before. It always causes a lot of excitement and generates talk about how the odds are not in that family's favor. But it happens too frequently to just be about odds. Gale's convinced the Capitol does it on purpose, rigs the drawings to add extra drama. Given all the trouble I've caused, I've probably guaranteed any child of mine a spot in the Games.</div>

<div class="line_en">I think of Haymitch, unmarried, no family, blotting out the world with drink. He could have had his choice of any woman in the district. And he chose solitude. Not solitude -- that sounds too peaceful. More like solitary confinement. Was it because, having been in the arena, he knew it was better than risking the alternative? I had a taste of that alternative when they called Prim's name on reaping day and I watched her walk to the stage to her death. But as her sister I could take her place, an option forbidden to our mother.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我想到了黑密斯，他没有结婚，没有孩子，整日沉醉于酒精之中。他本可以在十二区选中任何—位女子，可他却选择了独自一人。不是独自一人，这听上去太平静了，而是孤寂。这是不是因为在经历了竞技场的一切之后，他知道这样比另一种冒险更好？在收获节仪式上，当波丽姆的名字被抽中、我眼看着她走向前台（台前）、走向死亡的时候，我就曾有过这样的念头。作为她的姐姐，我代替了她的位置，但，对妈妈来说，无论谁去，都是可怕的事情。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">District 11. Our first stop. I'd rather start in any other district, since this was Rue's home. But that's not how the Victory Tour works. Usually it kicks off in 12 and then goes in descending district order to 1, followed by the Capitol. The victor's district is skipped and saved for very last. Since 12 puts on the least fabulous celebration -- usually just a dinner for the tributes and a victory rally in the square, where nobody looks like they're having any fun -- it's probably best to get us out of the way as soon as possible. This year, for the first time since Haymitch won, the final stop on the tour will be 12, and the Capitol will spring for the festivities.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="十一区。这是我们的第一站，我宁愿第一站在其他任何一个区，因为这里是露露的家啊。可通常，胜利巡演应该从第十二区开始，依次排序，直至第一区，然后到达凯匹特，最后的欢庆活动要在胜利者所在区举办。可由于十二区的庆祝活动并不热烈，一般地就是为胜利者举办一场宴会，在广场举办一次集会，参加者似乎也兴味索然，因而对于凯匹特来说，最好是让我们赶紧离开。因此自从黑密斯获胜以来还是第一次把十二区安排到巡演的最后一站，最终的欢庆活动改在凯匹特进行。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“噢，天知道黑密斯在哪儿？”艾菲说道。说实在的，我也没指望见到黑密斯，他恐怕刚上床。“西纳一直在忙着弄你的服装，睡得很晚，他肯定给你准备了上百套服装。你的晚礼服真是太棒了。皮塔的团队可能也还在睡觉。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">What does this mean? It means I get to spend the morning having the hair ripped off my body while Peeta sleeps in. I hadn't thought about it much, but in the arena at least some of the boys got to keep their body hair whereas none of the girls did. I can remember Peeta's now, as I bathed him by the stream. Very blond in the sunlight, once the mud and blood had been washed away. Only his face remained completely smooth. Not one of the boys grew a beard, and many were old enough to. I wonder what they did to them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是什么意思？这就是说我要花一上午刮汗毛，而皮塔却在睡觉。我以前对这个也没多想，但在竞技场，至少男孩可以保留汗毛，而女孩却不行。我记起来皮塔有汗毛，因为我在小溪旁帮他冲洗时有印象。身上的泥土和血冲洗掉之后，露出了金黄色的汗毛。只有脸部是光洁的。男孩也没有一个长胡子，可他们已经到了年龄。我纳闷他们是怎么给男选手收拾的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">If I feel ragged, my prep team seems in worse condition, knocking back coffee and sharing brightly colored little pills. As far as I can tell, they never get up before noon unless there's some sort of national emergency, like my leg hair. I was so happy when it grew back in, too. As if it were a sign that things might be returning to normal. I run my fingers along the soft, curly down on my legs and give myself over to the team. None of them are up to their usual chatter, so I can hear every strand being yanked from its follicle. I have to soak in a tub full of a thick, unpleasant-smelling solution, while my face and hair are plastered with creams. Two more baths follow in other, less offensive, concoctions. I'm plucked and scoured and massaged and anointed until I'm raw.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果说我挺累的话，那我的化妆师们好像情况更糟，他们靠大量的咖啡和色彩鲜艳的小药片保持体力。据我所知，除非有我长出腿毛这样的国家大事，他们都要酣睡至中午起床。每当我的体毛又长出来的时候，我很高兴，好像这才是一切恢复正常的标志。当我可以摸到自己腿上柔软、卷曲的汗毛时，我就把自己交给他们。要是他们碰巧没有平时那么喧闹，我就能听到自己的汗毛从毛囊里拔出时发出的声响。通常我需要泡在满是怪味液体的浴缸里，头发和脸上抹上了洗涤液。之后还要再进行两次沐浴，浴液的味道不像前一次那么刺鼻。然后他们给我再次除毛、冲洗、按摩、涂上精油，直至最后把我弄得浑身刺痛才算完。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The thought of being left to my prep team's fashion whims only adds to the miseries competing for my attention -- my abused body, my lack of sleep, my mandatory marriage, and the terror of being unable to satisfy President Snow's demands. By the time I reach lunch, where Effie, Cinna, Portia, Haymitch, and Peeta have started without me, I'm too weighed down to talk. They're raving about the food and how well they sleep on trains. Everyone's all full of excitement about the tour. Well, everyone but Haymitch. He's nursing a hangover and picking at a muffin. I'm not really hungry, either, maybe because I loaded up on too much rich stuff this morning or maybe because I'm so unhappy. I play around with a bowl of broth, eating only a spoonful or two. I can't even look at Peeta -- my designated future husband -- although I know none of this is his fault.</div>

Our server reports it will not just be for a fuel stop -- some part has malfunctioned and must be replaced. It will require at least an hour. This sends Effie into a state. She pulls out her schedule and begins to work out how the delay will impact every event for the rest of our lives. Finally I just can't stand to listen to her anymore.</div>

I find the exit door, force it open -- triggering some sort of alarm, which I ignore -- and jump to the ground, expecting to land in snow. But the air's warm and balmy against my skin. The trees still wear green leaves. How far south have we come in a day? I walk along the track, squinting against the bright sunlight, already regretting my words to Effie. She's hardly to blame for my current predicament. I should go back and apologize. My outburst was the height of bad manners, and manners matter deeply to her. But my feet continue on along the track, past the end of the train, leaving it behind. An hour's delay. I can walk at least twenty minutes in one direction and make it back with plenty of time to spare. Instead, after a couple hundred yards, I sink to the ground and sit there, looking into the distance. If I had a bow and arrows, would I just keep going?</div>

Huge open fields with herds of dairy cattle grazing in them. So unlike our own heavily wooded home. We slow slightly and I think we might be coming in for another stop, when a fence rises up before us. Towering at least thirty-five feet in the air and topped with wicked coils of barbed wire, it makes ours back in District 12 look childish. My eyes quickly inspect the base, which is lined with enormous metal plates. There would be no burrowing under those, no escaping to hunt.

In school they refer to it as a large district, that's all. No actual figures on the population. But those kids we see on camera waiting for the reaping each year, they can't be but a sampling of the ones who actually live here. What do they do? Have preliminary drawings?

But in 11 -- maybe because there's not much of a city to begin with, things being so spread out, or maybe because they don't want to waste so many people while the harvest is on -- the public appearance is confined to the square. It takes place before their Justice Building, a huge marble structure. Once, it must have been a thing of beauty, but time has taken its toll. Even on television you can see ivy overtaking the crumbling facade, the sag of the roof. The square itself is ringed with run-down storefronts, most of which are abandoned.

Peeta and I will be introduced, the mayor of 11 will read a speech in our honor, and we'll respond with a scripted thank-you provided by the Capitol. If a victor had any special allies among the dead tributes, it is considered good form to add a few personal comments as well. I should say something about Rue, and Thresh, too, really, but every time I tried to write it at home, I ended up with a blank paper staring me in the face. It's hard for me to talk about them without getting emotional. Fortunately, Peeta has a little something worked up, and with some slight alterations, it can count for both of us.

<div class="line_en">I look at Peeta and he gives me a sad smile. I hear Haymitch's voice. "You could do a lot worse." At this moment, it's impossible to imagine how I could do any better. The gift… it is perfect. So when I rise up on tiptoe to kiss him, it doesn't seem forced at all.</div>

<div class="line_en">The mayor steps forward and presents us each with a plaque that's so large I have to put down my bouquet to hold it. The ceremony's about to end when I notice one of Rue's sisters staring at me. She must be about nine and is almost an exact replica of Rue, down to the way she stands with her arms slightly extended. Despite the good news about the winnings, she's not happy. In fact, her look is reproachful. Is it because I didn't save Rue?</div>

But that gesture will mean nothing if I don't support it now.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我感到一阵羞耻。这女孩想得没错。我怎么能站在这里，被动地一言不发，而把一切都委托给皮塔呢？如果是露露赢了，她不会让我悄无声息地白白死去。记得在竞技场，我多么认真地在她的身上摆上花朵，我不能让她悄然死去。可是，如果我此时无所表示，那样做也就毫无意义了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I stand there, feeling broken and small, thousands of eyes trained on me. There's a long pause. Then, from somewhere in the crowd, someone whistles Rue's four-note mockingjay tune. The one that signaled the end of the workday in the orchards. The one that meant safety in the arena. By the end of the tune, I have found the whistler, a wizened old man in a faded red shirt and overalls. His eyes meet mine.</div>
