<div class="line_en">It was his fault Sirius had died; it was all his fault. If he, Harry, had not been stupid enough to fall for Voldemort's trick, if he had not been so convinced that what he had seen in his dream was real, if he had only opened his mind to the possibility that Voldemort was, as Hermione had said, banking on Harry's love of playing the hero…</div>

<div class="line_en">Everything seemed to have repaired itself during the Headmasters absence. The delicate silver instruments stood once more on the spindle-legged tables, puffing and whirring serenely. The portraits of the headmasters and headmistresses were snoozing in their frames, heads lolling back in armchairs or against the edge of the picture. Harry looked through the window. There was a cool line of pale green along the horizon: dawn was approaching.</div>

<div class="line_en">The silence and the stillness, broken only by the occasional grunt or snuffle of a sleeping portrait, was unbearable to him.

But he had to think… there was no escape…</div>

<div class="line_en">"It is my fault that Sirius died," said Dumbledore clearly. "Or should I say, almost entirely my fault -- I will not be so arrogant as to claim responsibility for the whole. Sirius was a brave, clever and energetic man, and such men are not usually content to sit at home in hiding while they believe others to be in danger. Nevertheless, you should never have believed for an instant that there was any necessity for you to go to the Department of Mysteries tonight. If I had been open with you, Harry, as I should have been, you would have known a long time ago that Voldemort might try and lure you to the Department of Mysteries, and you would never have been tricked into going there tonight. And Sirius would not have had to come after you. That blame lies with me, and with me alone."</div>

From it, he withdrew silvery, gossamer-fine strands of thought clinging to the wand and deposited them into the basin.

<div class="line_en">"There is a room in the Department of Mysteries," interrupted Dumbledore, "that is kept locked at all times. It contains a force that is at once more wonderful and more terrible than death, than human intelligence, than the forces of nature. It is also, perhaps, the most mysterious of the many subjects for study that reside there. It is the power held within that room that you possess in such quantities and which Voldemort has not at all. That power took you to save Sirius tonight. That power also saved you from possession by Voldemort, because he could not bear to reside in a body so full of the force he detests. In the end, it mattered not that you could not close your mind. It was your heart that saved you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“神秘事务司里有一问屋子，”邓布利多打断了他的话，“始终锁着。那里面有一种力量，比死亡，比人类的智慧，比自然的力量更神奇，更可怕。它或许也是神秘事务司里许多需要研究的课题中最神秘莫测的一个。你拥有那间屋子里的全部能量，而伏地魔却一点儿没有。正是这个能量在今天晚上带着你去营救小天狼星。也正是这个能量使你免遭伏地魔的控制，因为他投有办法忍受依附在一个充满着他所憎恨厌恶的力量的身体里。最后，你没有办法封闭你的大脑并没有什么大碍，是你的心救了你。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry closed his eyes. If he had not gone to save Sirius, Sirius would not have died… More to stave off the moment when he would have to think of Sirius again, Harry asked, without caring much about the answer, "The end of the prophecy… it was something about… neither can live…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利闭上了眼睛。如果他没有去营救小天狼星，小天狼星就不会死…他又不由自主地想起小天狼星，接着他马上设法避开这个回忆时刻。于是他接着问，而心里根本没有太在意答案是什么：“预言的最后…它是说…两个人不能都活着…”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"So," said Harry, dredging up the words from what felt like a deep well of despair inside him, "so does that mean that… that one of us has got to kill the other one… in the end?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"I feel I owe you another explanation, Harry," said Dumbledore hesitantly. "You may, perhaps, have wondered why I never chose you as a prefect? I must confess… that I rather thought… you had enough responsibility to be going on with."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我觉得我还欠你另一个解释，哈利，”邓布利多吞吞吐吐地说，“你曾经也许纳闷为什么我没有把你选为级长？我必须承认…我更认为…你已经有太多的责任需要承担。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For a long time, neither of them spoke. Somewhere far beyond the office walls, Harry could hear the sound of voices, students heading down to the Great Hall for an early breakfast, perhaps. It seemed impossible that there could be people in the world who still desired food, who laughed, who neither knew nor cared that Sirius Black was gone for ever. Sirius seemed a million miles away already; even now a part of Harry still believed that if he had only pulled back that veil, he would have found Sirius looking back at him, greeting him, perhaps, with his laugh like a bark…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="很长一段时间，他们谁也没有说话。哈利可以听到远在办公室墙外的某个地方有说话的声音，学生们可能正走向大礼堂去吃早餐。真令人难以置信，这个世界上居然还会有人仍在想着吃饭，仍能够笑出声来，他们没有人知道，也不会关心小天狼星布莱克永远地离开了。小天狼星似乎已远在万里之遥；即使是现在，哈利仍有一些相信如果他拉开那幅帷幔，他会发现小天狼星正回头看着他，向他问候，像犬吠一样地笑着…">查看中文翻译</div>
