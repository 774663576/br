<div class="line_en">The bears took Lyra up a gully in the cliffs, where the fog lay even more thickly than on the shore. The cries of the cliff-ghasts and the crash of the waves grew fainter as they climbed, and presently the only sound was the ceaseless crying of seabirds. They clambered in silence over rocks and snowdrifts, and although Lyra peered wide-eyed into the enfolding grayness, and strained her ears for the sound of her friends, she might have been the only human on Svalbard; and lorek might have been dead.</div>

<div class="line_en">The bear sergeant said nothing to her until they were on level ground. There they stopped. From the sound of the waves, Lyra judged them to have reached the top of the cliffs, and she dared not run away in case she fell over the edge.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那个熊警官对她什么话也没说。后来，他们来到了平地上，停了下来。从海浪的声音判断，莱拉觉得他们来到了崖顶。她也不敢逃跑，因为害怕从悬崖边上掉下去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Look up," said the bear, as a waft of breeze moved aside the heavy curtain of the fog.</div>

<div class="line_en">There was little daylight in any case, but Lyra did look, and found herself standing in front of a vast building of stone. It was as tall at least as the highest part of Jordan college, but much more massive, and carved all over with representations of warfare, showing bears victorious and Skraelings surrendering, showing Tartars chained and slaving in the fire mines, showing zeppelins flying from all parts of the world bearing gifts and tributes to the king of the bears, lofur Raknison.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽然几乎没有什么亮光，莱拉还是看了一眼，发现自己正站在一座巨大的石头建筑前面。它至少有乔丹学院最高的建筑物那么高，但要大出许多，上面刻满了战争的场面，描绘的是披甲熊取得了胜利和斯克雷林丑人投降、鞑靼人被铁链拴着在火矿做苦力、齐柏林飞艇从世界各地飞来向披甲熊国王埃欧弗尔·拉克尼松进贡。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The bears seemed not to see the mess, however, and they led the way in through the huge arch, over the icy ground that was filthy with the spatter of the birds. There was a courtyard, and high steps, and gateways, and at every point bears in armor challenged the incomers and were given a password. Their armor was polished and gleaming, and they all wore plumes in their helmets. Lyra couldn't help comparing every bear she saw with lorek Byrnison, and always to his advantage; he was more powerful, more graceful, and his armor was real armor, rust-colored, bloodstained, dented with combat, not elegant, enameled, and decorative like most of what she saw around her now.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，披甲熊却似乎看不到这又脏又乱的一切。他们领着她，穿过巨大的拱门，走在覆盖着冰雪和脏乎乎的鸟粪的地面上。里面是一个院子、高高的台阶和几个大门。每经过一个地方，身穿盔甲的披甲熊便喝令这些来访者站住，以便验明身份，他们便回答口令。他们的盔甲显得非常精美，闪着微光，头盔上全都插着羽毛。莱拉情不自禁地把自己见到的每一只熊跟埃欧雷克·伯尔尼松作一比较，结果总是埃欧雷克胜他们一筹。他比他们更强壮、更得体，他的盔甲也是货真价实的盔甲，带着锈迹斑斑的颜色，沾满了血迹，一次次战斗在上面留下了凹凸不平的印记，不像她此时看到的周围的大部分盔甲那样优雅、光鲜、华而不实。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At least, that was what the bear sergeant told her the carvings showed. She had to take his word for it, because every projection and ledge on the deeply sculpted facade was occu-pied by gannets and skuas, which cawed and shrieked and wheeled constantly around overhead, and whose droppings had coated every part of the building with thick smears of dirty white.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这就是那些雕刻描绘的内容——至少熊警官是这么告诉她的。莱拉不得不相信他的话，因为正门上深深雕刻着的每一个凸起和壁架全都被鲱鸟和贼鸥占据了，它们忽粗忽细地大叫着，不断地在头顶上方盘旋。房子的每一个地方都被鸟粪涂抹上了一层厚厚的白色的脏乎乎的东西。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Finally they stopped outside a heavy door of iron. A guard bear pulled back a massive bolt, and the sergeant suddenly swung his paw at Lyra, knocking her head over heels through the doorway. Before she could scramble up, she heard the door being bolted behind her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后，他们在一扇沉重的铁门外停了下来。一个熊哨兵撇下巨大的门闩，那个熊警官突然向莱拉挥起爪子，按住她的脑袋，一把把她推了进去。没等她明白是怎么回事，便听到身后的门被“哐啷”一声闩上了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As they went further in, the temperature rose, and so did something else. The smell in lofur's palace was repulsive: rancid seal fat, dung, blood, refuse of every sort. Lyra pushed back her hood to be cooler, but she couldn't help wrinkling her nose. She hoped bears couldn't read human expressions. There were iron brackets every few yards, holding blubber lamps, and in their flaring shadows it wasn't always easy to see where she was treading, either.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="再往里走，温度便升高了，某些气味也随之浓重起来。埃欧弗尔的宫殿里的气味真是令人作呕：腐臭的海豹肉味、粪便味、血腥味，还有各种各样的垃圾的味道。莱拉把风帽往后推了推，以便稍微凉快一下，但她还是禁不住皱起了鼻子——但愿披甲熊看不懂人类的表情。地上每隔几码的距离便放着几个铁架子，上面托着鲸油灯。摇曳的灯影下，要看清她走在什么地方也并不总是容易的事情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was profoundly dark, but Pantalaimon became a firefly, and shed a tiny glow around them. They were in a narrow cell where the walls dripped with damp, and there was one stone bench for furniture. In the farthest corner there was a heap of rags she took for bedding, and that was all she could see.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="里面漆黑一片，好在潘特莱蒙变成了一只萤火虫，在他们周围发出一丝微弱的亮光。这是一间监狱，四周的墙壁十分潮湿，滴着水珠，里面放着一条石凳，算是家具。最里面的墙角里堆着一堆破布片，算是她睡觉的地方。她能看得到的也只有这些了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Pantalaimon flew down to her wrist, and sat there glowing while Lyra composed her mind. With a part of her, she found it remarkable that she could sit here in terrible danger and yet sink into the calm she needed to read the alethiometer; and yet it was so much a part of her now that the most complicated questions sorted themselves out into their constituent symbols as naturally as her muscles moved her limbs: she hardly had to think about them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="潘特莱蒙飞到她腰问，蹲在那儿发着光。莱拉努力让自己镇静下来。她的部分思绪又开始工作了：虽然此时身处可怕的危险之中，但她依然能够保持着看懂真理仪所需要的那份沉着，她觉得这实在是了不起。然而，她的这一部分思绪又是那么地活跃，以至于那些最复杂的问题竟然自动地转化成了相应的符号，就像她的肌肉带动四肢那么自然：她几乎都用不着动脑子去想。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“这些披甲熊是不会让他这么干的，是不是？”她对潘特莱蒙说，“他们数量太多了。潘，我真希望自己是女巫，这样你就能离开我去找他，给他带个信等等，我们就能制定一个适当的计划…”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The little wavering point of light danced through the air and fluttered around the head of the speaker. And it hadn't been a heap of rags after all; it was a gray-bearded man, chained to the wall, whose eyes glittered in Pantalaimon's luminance, and whose tattered hair hung over his shoulders. His daemon, a weary-looking serpent, lay in his lap, flicking out her tongue occasionally as Pantalaimon flew near.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="潘特莱蒙变的那点摇曳的亮光在空中飞舞着，在说话的那个人的头顶上方盘旋。原来，角落里的那一堆根本就不是破布，而是一个长着灰白大胡子的男子。他被铁链子锁在墙上，在潘特莱蒙的微光下，他的两眼熠熠闪光，蓬乱的头发披散在肩上。他的精灵是一条疲倦不堪的毒蛇，趴在他的大腿上，在潘特莱蒙飞近的时候不断地吐着毒信。">查看中文翻译</div>

He was wearing a heavy gold chain around his neck, with a gaudy jewel hanging from it, and his claws -- a good six inches long -- were each covered in gold leaf.

<div class="line_en">The great bear was helpless. Lyra found her power over him almost intoxicating, and if Pantalaimon hadn't nipped her hand sharply to remind her of the danger they were all in, she might have lost all her sense of proportion.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这只伟大的熊已经完全身不由己了。莱拉发现自己对他控制得简直令人陶醉。要不是潘特莱蒙使劲捏了捏她的手，提醒她周围凶险的环境的话，她差不多就会得意忘形起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But she came to herself and stepped modestly back to watch and wait as the bears, under lofur's excited direction, prepared the combat ground for lorek Byrnison; and meanwhile lorek, knowing nothing about it, was hurrying ever closer toward what she wished she could tell him was a fight for his life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，她最终还是醒悟过来，谦卑地往后一退，看着披甲熊在埃欧弗尔兴奋的命令下，为埃欧雷克·伯尔尼松准备战场，耐心地等待着。与此同时，对此一无所知的埃欧雷克正疾速地向这边赶来，她真希望自己能告诉他，这是一场关乎他生死存亡的决斗。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Tell them… tell them that to make your kingdom com-pletely secure, you've called lorek Byrnison here yourself to fight him, and the winner will rule over the bears forever. See, if you make it look like your idea that he's coming, and not his, they'll be really impressed. They'll think you're able to call him here from far away. They'll think you can do anything."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“告诉他们…告诉他们说，为了让你的王国绝对安全，你亲自把埃欧雷克·伯尔尼松召了过来，跟他决斗，获胜者将永远统治披甲熊。你看，你要是能让他们觉得埃欧雷克到这儿来是你自己的主意，不是他主动来的，他们的印象会非常深刻，他们会觉得你能在很远的地方就能把他召过来，他们会觉得你神通广大。”">查看中文翻译</div>
