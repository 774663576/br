<div class="line_en">From Leonard he got little -- a dry campaign over an arid waste of Latin prose: first, a harsh, stiff, unintelligent skirmishing among the rules of grammar, which frightened and bewildered him needlessly, and gave him for years an unhealthy dislike of syntax, and an absurd prejudice against the laws on which the language was built. Then, a year's study of the lean, clear precision of Cæsar, the magnificent structure of the style -- the concision, the skeleton certainty, deadened by the disjointed daily partition, the dull parsing, the lumbering cliché of pedantic translation:</div>

<div class="line_en">They spent a weary age, two years, on that dull dog, Cicero. De Senectute. De Amicitia.

<div class="line_en">The mathematics and history teacher was John Dorsey's sister Amy. She was a powerful woman, five feet ten inches tall, who weighed 185 pounds. She had very thick black hair, straight and oily, and very black eyes, giving a heavy sensuousness to her face. Her thick forearms were fleeced with light down. She was not fat, but she corsetted tightly, her powerful arms and heavy shoulders bulging through the cool white of her shirtwaists. In warm weather she perspired abundantly: her waists were stained below the arm-pits with big spreading blots of sweat; in the winter, as she warmed herself by the fire, she had about her the exciting odor of chalk, and the strong good smell of a healthy animal. Eugene, passing down the wind-swept back porch one day in winter, looked in on her room just as her tiny niece opened the door to come out. She sat before a dancing coal-fire, after her bath, drawing on her stockings. Fascinated, he stared at her broad red shoulders, her big body steaming cleanly like a beast.</div>

<div class="line_en">He had caught a glimpse, in an American college, of the great structure of the most architectural of languages: he felt the sculptural perfection of such a word as [Greek word], but his opinions smelled of chalk, the classroom, and a very bad lamp -- Greek was good because it was ancient, classic, and academic. The smell of the East, the dark tide of the Orient that flowed below, touched the lives of poet and soldier, with something perverse, evil, luxurious, was as far from his life as Lesbos. He was simply the mouthpiece of a formula of which he was assured without having a genuine belief.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sister Sheba arrived with her consumptive husband at the end of the second year -- cadaver, flecked lightly on the lips with blood, seventy-three years old. They said he was forty-nine -- sickness made him look old. He was a tall man, six feet three, with long straight mustaches, waxen and emaciated as a mandarin. He painted pictures -- impressionist blobs -- sheep on a gorsey hill, fishboats at the piers, with a warm red jumble of brick buildings in the background.</div>

With lazy cat-warmth she smiled on all the world.</div>

Brokenly, obscurely, he was beginning to feel that it was not truth that men live for -- the creative men -- but for falsehood. At times his devouring, unsated brain seemed to be beyond his governance: it was a frightful bird whose beak was in his heart, whose talons tore unceasingly at his bowels.

Ben stood at the veranda rail, leaning upon his cocked leg, smoking with deep lung inhalations. Eugene went over and stood by him. They heard the wail upstairs. Eugene snickered, looking up at the thin ivory mask. Ben lifted his white hand sharply to strike him, but dropped it with a growl of contempt, smiling faintly.

He liked to be there most in the afternoons when the crowd of boys had gone, and when he was free to wander about the old house, under the singing majesty of great trees, exultant in the proud solitude of that fine hill, the clean windy rain of the acorns, the tang of burning leaves. He would read wolfishly until Margaret discovered him and drove him out under the trees or toward the flat court behind Bishop Raper's residence at the entrance, which was used for basketball. Here, while the western sky reddened, he raced down toward the goal, passing the ball to a companion, exulting in his growing swiftness, agility, and expertness in shooting the basket.</div>

Day after day to the ache of his body was added the ache and shame of his spirit, but he hung on with a pallid smile across his lips, and envy and fear of their strength in his heart. He parroted faithfully all that John Dorsey had to say about the "spirit of fair play," "sportsmanship," "playing the game for the game's sake," "accepting defeat or victory with a smile," and so on, but he had no genuine belief or understanding.

<div class="line_en">And Eugene noted, with the old baffling shame again, as this cheap tableau of self-conscious, robust, and raucously aggressive boyhood was posed, that, for all the mouthing of phrases, the jargon about fair play and sportsmanship, the weaker, at Leonard's, was the legitimate prey of the stronger. Leonard, beaten by a boy in a play of wits, or in an argument for justice, would assert the righteousness of his cause by physical violence. These spectacles were ugly and revolting: Eugene watched them with sick fascination.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在又一次的羞愧中，尤金发现，在那些自以为是、精力充沛、粗鲁好斗的童年中，虽然大家整天都强调“运动员美德”，但是在伦纳德的学堂里，弱小的人总会受到强横者的欺凌，好似这样做就是理所当然。至于伦纳德先生本人，每每在玩智慧或讲道理时被哪一个学生击败了，他便会动用蛮力来维护自己的正义。尤金对这些现象既厌恶又不赞成，但是他却带着厌恶和好奇，痴迷地观察着这一切。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Leonard himself was not a bad man -- he was a man of considerable character, kindliness, and honest determination. He loved his family, he stood up with some courage against the bigotry in the Methodist church, where he was a deacon, and at length had to withdraw because of his remarks on Darwin's theory. He was, thus, an example of that sad liberalism of the village -- an advanced thinker among the Methodists, a bearer of the torch at noon, an apologist for the toleration of ideas that have been established for fifty years. He tried faithfully to do his duties as a teacher. But he was of the earth -- even his heavy-handed violence was of the earth, and had in it the unconscious brutality of nature. Although he asserted his interest in "the things of the mind," his interest in the soil was much greater, and he had added little to his stock of information since leaving college. He was slow-witted and quite lacking in the sensitive intuitions of Margaret, who loved the man with such passionate fidelity, however, that she seconded all his acts before the world. Eugene had even heard her cry out in a shrill, trembling voice against a student who had answered her husband insolently: "Why, I'd slap his head off! That's what I'd do!" And the boy had trembled, with fear and nausea, to see her so. But thus, he knew, could love change one. Leonard thought his actions wise and good: he had grown up in a tradition that demanded strict obedience to the master, and that would not brook opposition to his rulings. He had learned from his father, a Tennessee patriarch who ran a farm, preached on Sundays, and put down rebellion in his family with a horse-whip and pious prayers, the advantages of being God! He thought little boys who resisted him should be beaten.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="伦纳德本人并不坏——他是个很有骨气的人。他为人和善、诚实、做事果断、坚决。他深爱着自己的家庭，并在卫理公会教派担任执事。同时他富有勇气站出来反对一般教友的褊狭思想，最后因为发表了同达尔文学说有关的见解而被迫辞职。所以，他是整个村子里可怜巴巴自由主义者的典范——一位卫理公会教派先进的思想家，是一个午时奔跑的火炬手，敢于捍卫50年前建立起来的思想。他努力地恪守一名教师的职责。可是他终究出身泥土——就连他那动手打人的粗暴脾气也来源于泥土，其中含有自然界不自觉的蛮性。他虽然口口声声坚称自己的兴趣是“动脑筋”，但实际上他对耕田种地的兴趣更加浓厚。大学毕业以后，他脑子里的知识变得越来越少。他的大脑反应很迟钝，远远比不上他夫人玛格丽特天生敏感聪慧，可是她却真挚、忠心地爱着他，她对他的所有行为都表示支持。有一次，一个学生在她丈夫面前言辞傲慢，尤金看见她竟然气得浑身颤抖，尖声地叫喊：“哎呀，这是什么话！我非得抽他两个嘴巴子不可！”那个孩子一见这个情景，吓得浑身直哆嗦。于是尤金才明白，爱的力量会转移人的性情。伦纳德自认为他做的事情都是明智的、正确的，因为他自己接受的传统教育要求学生必须坚决地服从老师，不允许有任何的反抗。这是从他父亲那里学来的，他的父亲是田纳西州一个农民家庭的家长，每个星期日都要上教堂去布道，平时只要家里的子女不守规矩，他就会手执马鞭，口里念着虔诚的祷告予以适当的镇压，行使上帝的神权！他认为小孩子敢于反抗，就是找打。">查看中文翻译</div>

Leonard, on second thought, did not go to the Bishop. He went to the Grocer.</div>

<div class="line_en">At twelve, he was a tall slender lad, with dark amber features, and the mincing effeminacy of an old maid. He was terrified in the company of other boys, all that was sharp, spinsterly, and venomous, would come protectively to the surface when he was ridiculed or threatened, and he would burst into shrill unpleasant laughter, or hysterical tears. His mincing walk, with the constant gesture of catching maidenly at the fringe of his coat as he walked along, his high husky voice, with a voluptuous and feminine current playing through it, drew upon him at once the terrible battery of their dislike.</div>

His father was a jeweller, a man with a dark, gentle floridity of manner and complexion. He had white delicate fingers. His counters were filled with old brooches, gemmed buckles, ancient incrusted watches. The boy had two sisters -- large handsome women. His mother was dead.

Fear he knew well.
