<div class="line_en">She wore her tight-lipped, pinched-nose look as she scanned the menu, muttering, "Not too many good things, this menu." Then she tapped the waiter's arm, wiped the length of her chopsticks with her finger, and sniffed: "This greasy thing, do you expect me to eat with it?" She made a show of washing out her rice bowl with hot tea, and then warned other restaurant patrons seated near us to do the same. She told the waiter to make sure the soup was very hot, and of course, it was by her tongue's expert estimate "not even lukewarm."</div>

<div class="line_en">And she was right. Despite all the tension she places on herself -- and others -- the doctors have proclaimed that my mother, at age sixty-nine, has the blood pressure of a sixteen-year-old and the strength of a horse. And that's what she is. A Horse, born in 1918, destined to be obstinate and frank to the point of tactlessness. She and I make a bad combination, because I'm a Rabbit, born in 1951, supposedly sensitive, with tendencies toward being thin-skinned and skittery at the first sign of criticism.</div>

<div class="line_en">And so I watched her, seeing her reaction to the changes in my apartment -- from the pristine habitat I maintained after the divorce, when all of a sudden I had too much time to keep my life in order -- to this present chaos, a home full of life and love. The hallway floor was littered with Shoshana's toys, all bright plastic things with scattered parts. There was a set of Rich's barbells in the living room, two dirty snifters on the coffee table, the disemboweled remains of a phone that Shoshana and Rich took apart the other day to see where the voices came from.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因此打她一进门，我就留心看着她的反应——离婚后，我还是住在原来的公寓。那时，一度有太多的空余时间，可以将居室收拾得井井有条。直到今天，我的家又充满了生活和爱的气息，因此，又重复现出一片凌乱：过道上乱丢着苏珊娜的玩具；起居室里，养着一条四须淡水鱼，那是里奇的宠物；咖啡桌上，两只用过的脏酒杯还来不及洗；还有一架内脏被掏空了的电话机，那是苏珊娜和里奇有一天为着要研究声音是从哪发出而拆下来的。">查看中文翻译</div>

In the morning she was there as well, feeding me rice porridge flavored with chicken broth she had strained herself. She said she was feeding me this because I had the chicken pox and one chicken knew how to fight another. And in the afternoon, she sat in a chair in my room, knitting me a pink sweater while telling me about a sweater that Auntie Suyuan had knit for her daughter June, and how it was most unattractive and of the worst yarn.

I secretly referred to my pregnancy as my "growing resentment," and I dragged Marvin down to the clinic so he would have to suffer through this too. It turned out we went to the wrong kind of clinic. They made us watch a film, a terrible bit of puritanical brainwash. I saw those little things, babies they called them even at seven weeks, and they had tiny, tiny fingers. And the film said that the baby's translucent fingers could move, that we should imagine them clinging for life, grasping for a chance, this miracle of life. If they had shown anything else except tiny fingers -- so thank God they did. Because Shoshana really was a miracle. She was perfect.

<div class="line_en">The sexual chemistry was what really surprised me, though. I thought he'd be one of those quiet types who was awkwardly gentle and clumsy, the kind of mild-mannered guy who says, "Am I hurting you?" when I can't feel a thing. But he was so attuned to my every movement I was sure he was reading my mind. He had no inhibitions, and whatever ones he discovered I had he'd pry away from me like little treasures. He saw all those private aspects of me -- and I mean not just sexual private parts, but my darker side, my meanness, my pettiness, my self-loathing -- all the things I kept hidden. So that with him I was completely naked, and when I was, when I was feeling the most vulnerable -- when the wrong word would have sent me flying out the door forever -- he always said exactly the right thing at the right moment. He didn't allow me to cover myself up. He would grab my hands, look me straight in the eye and tell me something new about why he loved me.</div>

And I was afraid of what I would then lose, because Rich Schields adored me in the same way I adored Shoshana. His love was unequivocal. Nothing could change it. He expected nothing from me; my mere existence was enough. And at the same time, he said that he had changed -- for the better -- because of me. He was embarrassingly romantic; he insisted he never was until he met me. And this confession made his romantic gestures all the more ennobling. At work, for example, when he would staple "FYI -- For Your Information" notes to legal briefs and corporate returns that I had to review, he signed them at the bottom: "FYI -- Forever You &amp; I." The firm didn't know about our relationship, and so that kind of reckless behavior on his part thrilled me.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I was born in China, in Taiyuan," she said. "Taiwan is not China."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我是中国太原人。”她说。“台湾不是中国。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I guess we've evolved to just winning in the toy and electronics market," I said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不过我想而今，太原的种种优点，已发展到玩具市场和电子市场上了。”我说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We sank into silence, a stalemate. And then her eyes lighted up. "Now listen. You can also say the name of Taiyuan is Bing. Everyone from that city calls it that. Easier for you to say. Bing, it is a nickname."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们又陷入了沉默无言的僵局。顷刻，她眼睛一亮，又开口说：“听好，太原还有一个称谓，就是‘并’，太原城的人都这样称自己的城市。你发起这个音很容易的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Ai!" she cried loudly. "I'm not from Taiwan!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“呵，不，”她高声叫道，“我不是台湾人。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"How do you know this?" she asked eagerly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这话怎么说？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">My mother acted as if she hadn't heard me right. "This is true, we always know how to win. So now you know what is inside you, almost all good stuff from Taiyuan."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="妈只当作没听见。“所以，你看，太原孙家真是十分了不起的。因此你大脑构成的材料，也是太原货呢。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You see it on everything. Made in Taiwan."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你没发现？这每一件玩具上面都刻着，台湾制造！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Genghis Khan must have invented some magic arrows, then," I said. "After all, he conquered China."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是吗？那成吉思汗一定也发明一种无孔不入的箭了，”我不露声色地插话，“否则，他最后怎么征服中国的？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And just like that, the fragile connection we were starting to build snapped.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那好容易建立起来的默契，又破裂了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Sound is completely different! Country is completely different!" she said in a huff. "People there only dream that it is China, because if you are Chinese you can never let go of China in your mind."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“根本发音完全不同，而且地方也完全不同。”她怒气冲冲地说，“只要你是中国人，那你一辈子也放不开中国这两个字。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, I only thought you said 'Taiwan' because it sounds the same," I argued, irritated that she was upset by such an unintentional mistake.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，我一直以为你这是在说台湾①。”（注：①台湾与太原的发音在英语上很接近。）">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I smiled.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我笑了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Nobody calls San Francisco that!" I said, laughing. "People who call it that don't know any better."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我笑了。“没有人这样称旧金山的。有人这样称它，只是因为不知道该如何发好这个音。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She wrote down the character, and I nodded as if this made everything perfectly clear. "The same as here," she added in English. "You call Apple for New York. Frisco for San Francisco."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她又工工整整地写下这个字，我郑重其事地点点头，表示明白了。然后妈又用英语接下去说：“这好比你把纽约称为大苹果，把旧金山称作弗里斯可一样的道理。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And really, I did understand finally. Not what she had just said. But what had been true all along.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="说实在，我还是没有懂。不只是她说的那一套，而是对发生过的一切。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I saw what I had been fighting for: It was for me, a scared child, who had run away a long time ago to what I had imagined was a safer place. And hiding in this place, behind my invisible barriers, I knew what lay on the other side: Her side attacks. Her secret weapons. Her uncanny ability to find my weakest spots. But in the brief instant that I had peered over the barriers I could finally see what was really there: an old woman, a wok for her armor, a knitting needle for her sword, getting a little crabby as she waited patiently for her daughter to invite her in.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我一直在苦苦抗争的，究竟是什么？好久好久以前，在我还是一个孩子时，我就想躲到一道更安全的屏障后边，我要躲避的，就是妈的闲言碎语，妈对我的不足之处的寻觅和挑剔……曾几何时，那个我所躲避的，时时搅得我心烦意乱的，竟成了一个坏脾气的老妇人。多年来，她只是以她的绒线披肩为盾，编结针为剑，貌似张牙舞爪地，却在耐心等着自己的女儿，将她请进她的生活中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Now you understand my meaning," said my mother triumphantly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“现在懂了吗？”妈得意洋洋地说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You must go in October. That is the best time. Not too hot, not too cold. I am thinking of going back then too," she says authoritatively. And then she hastily adds: "Of course not with you!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你们得在十月份去。那是最好的时光，气候不冷也不热。我也想再回去看看。”她颇带权威性地说了一通后，又忙忙加了一句：“当然，我不会跟你们一起去的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Rich and I have decided to postpone our wedding. My mother says July is not a good time to go to China on our honeymoon. She knows this because she and my father have just returned from a trip to Beijing and Taiyuan.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="里奇和我，已经决定把婚期推延一阵。因妈说过，七月份不是去中国度蜜月的好季节。她之所以知道，是因为她和我爸刚从北京、太原观光回来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It is too hot in the summer. You will only grow more spots and then your whole face will become red!" she tells Rich. And Rich grins, gestures his thumb toward my mother, and says to me, "Can you believe what comes out of her mouth? Now I know where you get your sweet, tactful nature."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那边的夏天太热，你只会长出更多的斑点，然后，你的脸会晒得通红通红！”她对里奇说。里奇则高兴地哈哈大笑，一边朝我妈伸出大拇指，一边回头对我说：“你看你妈多会讲话，多体贴人。现在我可明白了，你那套甜甜的善解人意的小伎俩，是从哪来的了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And I know what she really means. She would love to go to China with us. And I would hate it. Three weeks' worth of her complaining about dirty chopsticks and cold soup, three meals a day -- well, it would be a disaster.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我知道她其实喜欢和我们一起结伴去。我讨厌她跟着去。这一去，整整三个礼拜就得听她抱怨一日三餐的肮脏，半冷不热的汤——得了，那三个星期的蜜月会给她搅掉的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I laugh nervously, and Rich jokes: "That'd be great, Lindo. You could translate all the menus for us, make sure we're not eating snakes or dogs by mistake." I almost kick him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我进出一个不自然的笑容，里奇则说着笑话：“你要跟我们一起去可真太妙了，你可以为我们翻译菜单，使我们不会稀里糊涂地吞下蛇肉和狗肉。”我几乎要狠狠踹他几脚。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No, this is not my meaning," insists my mother. "Really, I am not asking."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，不，我没这个意思要跟你们去。”妈一再表示，“真的没这个意思。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Yet part of me also thinks the whole idea makes perfect sense. The three of us, leaving our differences behind, stepping on the plane together, sitting side by side, lifting off, moving West to reach the East.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但从另一方面想想，我们三个各不相同的人，登上同一架飞机，并排坐着，从西方飞向东方，倒也挺有点意思的。">查看中文翻译</div>
