<div class="line_en">The day was hot and sticky, as all the days had been since they left the Sorrows. A ferocious southern sun beat down upon the crowded riverfront of Volon Therys, but heat was the last and least of Griff's concerns. The Golden Company was encamped three miles south of town, well north of where he had expected them, and Triarch Malaquo had come north with five thousand foot and a thousand horse to cut them off from the delta road. Daenerys Targaryen remained a world away, and Tyrion Lannister… well, he could be most anywhere. If the gods were good, Lannister's severed head was halfway back to King's Landing by now, but more like the dwarf was hale and whole and somewhere close, stinking drunk and plotting some new infamy.</div>

A golden skull atop a pole, and Homeless Harry Strickland in his place. Lemore was not wrong, he knew.

<div class="line_en">Last night he'd dreamt of Stoney Sept again. Alone, with sword in hand, he ran from house to house, smashing down doors, racing up stairs, leaping from roof to roof, as his ears rang to the sound of distant bells.

<div class="line_en">Seventeen years had come and gone since the Battle of the Bells, yet the sound of bells ringing still tied a knot in his guts. Others might claim that the realm was lost when Prince Rhaegar fell to Robert's warhammer on the Trident, but the Battle of the Trident would never have been fought if the griffin had only slain the stag there in Stoney Sept. The bells tolled for all of us that day. For Aerys and his queen, for Elia of Dorne and her little daughter, for every true man and honest woman in the Seven Kingdoms. And for my silver prince.</div>

<div class="line_en">So be it. He had grown fond of Lemore, but that did not mean he required her approval. Her task had been to instruct the prince in the doctrines of the Faith, and she had done that. No amount of prayer would put him on the Iron Throne, however. That was Griff's task. He had failed Prince Rhaegar once. He would not fail his son, not whilst life remained in his body.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就这样吧。他对莱摩儿女士渐生好感，但这并不意味着作决定需要征求她同意。她的职责只是指导王子七神信仰的教义——这点她完成得很好——但光靠祈祷是没法夺回铁王座的。战争，这是格里芬的使命。他辜负了雷加王子，但只要一息尚存，他就决不会辜负雷加的儿子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"They were," said Haldon, in an irritated tone, "and you had best not ask what they cost us. With Dothraki across the river, half the populace of Volon Therys has decided they would sooner be elsewhere, so horseflesh grows more expensive every day."</div>

<div class="line_en">I should have gone myself. After Selhorys, he had found it difficult to put the same trust in Haldon as previously. He let the dwarf beguile him with that glib tongue of his. Let him wander off into a whorehouse alone while he lingered like a mooncalf in the square. The brothel keeper had insisted that the little man had been carried off at swordpoint, but Griff was still not sure he believed that. The Imp was clever enough to have conspired in his own escape. This drunken captor that the whores spoke of could have been some henchman in his hire. I share the blame. After the dwarf put himself between Aegon and the stone man, I let down my guard. I should have slit his throat the first time I laid eyes on him.</div>

<div class="line_en">When the lad emerged from the cabin with Lemore by his side, Griff looked him over carefully from head to heel. The prince wore sword and dagger, black boots polished to a high sheen, a black cloak lined with blood-red silk. With his hair washed and cut and freshly dyed a deep, dark blue, his eyes looked blue as well. At his throat he wore three huge square-cut rubies on a chain of black iron, a gift from Magister Illyrio. Red and black. Dragon colors. That was good. "You look a proper prince," he told the boy. "Your father would be proud if he could see you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莱摩儿带着王子从船舱中出来，格里芬将他仔仔细细、从头到脚审视了一番。王子佩上了长剑和匕首，穿着擦得锃亮的黑皮靴和一件镶血红缎边的黑色大氅。他的头发认真梳洗打理过，再染成暗蓝色，衬得眼睛也是蓝的。他喉头用黑铁链串了三颗硕一大的方形红宝石，那是伊利里欧总督送的礼物。黑与红，正是龙的颜色。很好。“你今天很有王家风范，”他告诉孩子，“你父亲也会为你骄傲的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"They will do well enough, I suppose," he told Haldon. "The camp is only three miles south." The Shy Maid would have gotten them there more quickly, but he preferred to keep Harry Strickland ignorant of where he and the prince had been. Nor did he relish the prospect of splashing through the shallows to climb some muddy riverbank. That sort of entrance might serve for a sellsword and his son, but not for a great lord and his prince.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“就骑这些吧，”他告诉哈尔顿，“反正军营就在南边三里地外。”乘“含羞少女号”过去比较快，但他不愿向哈利·斯崔克兰暴露他和王子的秘密基地；他也不愿带着王子涉过泥泞的水滨浅滩去会面——那样的方式也许适合佣兵父子，却与前首相及其辅佐的王子殿下全然不配。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"There is wisdom in that," Griff admitted. It might have been different if Blackheart still commanded, but Myles Toyne was four years dead, and Homeless Harry Strickland was a different sort of man. He would not say that to the boy, however. That dwarf had already planted enough doubts in his young head. "Not every man is what he seems, and a prince especially has good cause to be wary… but go too far down that road, and the mistrust can poison you, make you sour and fearful." King Aerys was one such. By the end, even Rhaegar saw that plain enough. "You would do best to walk a middle course. Let men earn your trust with leal service… but when they do, be generous and openhearted."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他说的倒在理。”格里芬承认。如果黑心还是一团一长就好了，可惜米斯·托因死了四年，而无家可归的哈利·斯崔克兰完全是另一种人。但他不能把人心险恶讲得太透，小恶魔已在孩子年轻的头脑里种下了太多猜疑。“所谓知人知面不知心，身为王子，你完全有理由警惕…但另一方面，成大事者不拘小节，做事却不能畏手畏脚、杯弓蛇影。”伊里斯王就是反例，到最后，连雷加也放弃了父王。“最好的方式是不偏不倚，保持折中，让别人用忠诚的服务来逐步赢得你的信任…同时你要大度地接纳他们，慷慨地奖励他们。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They gave the prince the best of the three horses, a big grey gelding so pale that he was almost white. Griff and Haldon rode beside him on lesser mounts. The road ran south beneath the high white walls of Volon Therys for a good half mile. Then they left the town behind, following the winding course of the Rhoyne through willow groves and poppy fields and past a tall wooden windmill whose blades creaked like old bones as they turned.</div>

<div class="line_en">They found the Golden Company beside the river as the sun was lowering in the west. It was a camp that even Arthur Dayne might have approved of -- compact, orderly, defensible. A deep ditch had been dug around it, with sharpened stakes inside. The tents stood in rows, with broad avenues between them. The latrines had been placed beside the river, so the current would wash away the wastes. The horse lines were to the north, and beyond them, two dozen elephants grazed beside the water, pulling up reeds with their trunks. Griff glanced at the great grey beasts with approval. There is not a warhorse in all of Westeros that will stand against them.</div>

<div class="line_en">The men of the Golden Company were outside their tents, dicing, drinking, and swatting away flies. Griff wondered how many of them knew who he was. Few enough. Twelve years is a long time. Even the men who'd ridden with him might not recognize the exile lord Jon Connington of the fiery red beard in the lined, clean-shaved face and dyed blue hair of the sellsword Griff. So far as most of them were concerned, Connington had drunk himself to death in Lys after being driven from the company in disgrace for stealing from the war chest. The shame of the lie still stuck in his craw, but Varys had insisted it was necessary. "We want no songs about the gallant exile," the eunuch had tittered, in that mincing voice of his. "Those who die heroic deaths are long remembered, thieves and drunks and cravens soon forgotten."</div>

Below it was a second, no larger than a child's fist. Maelys the Monstrous and his nameless brother. The other skulls had a sameness to them, though several had been cracked and splintered by the blows that had slain them, and one had filed, pointed teeth. "Which one is Myles?" Griff found himself asking.</div>

<div class="line_en">"There. On the end." Flowers pointed. "Wait. I'll go announce you." He slipped inside the tent, leaving Griff to contemplate the gilded skull of his old friend. In life, Ser Myles Toyne had been ugly as sin. His famous forebear, the dark and dashing Terrence Toyne of whom the singers sang, had been so fair of face that even the king's mistress could not resist him; but Myles had been possessed of jug ears, a crooked jaw, and the biggest nose that Jon Connington had ever seen. When he smiled at you, though, none of that mattered. Blackheart, his men had named him, for the sigil on his shield. Myles had loved the name and all it hinted at. "A captain-general should be feared, by friend and foe alike," he had once confessed. "If men think me cruel, so much the better." The truth was otherwise. Soldier to the bone, Toyne was fierce but always fair, a father to his men and always generous to the exile lord Jon Connington.</div>

All the skulls were grinning, even Bittersteel's on the tall pike in the center. What does he have to grin about? He died defeated and alone, a broken man in an alien land. On his deathbed, Ser Aegor Rivers had famously commanded his men to boil the flesh from his skull, dip it in gold, and carry it before them when they crossed the sea to retake Westeros.

He wore a feathered cloak of green and orange, magnificent to behold. The cadaverous Volantene, Gorys Edoryen, had replaced Strickland as paymaster. A leopard skin was draped across one shoulder, and hair as red as blood tumbled to his shoulders in oiled ringlets though his pointed beard was black. The spymaster was new to Griff, a Lyseni named Lysono Maar, with lilac eyes and white-gold hair and lips that would have been the envy of a whore. At first glance, Griff had almost taken him for a woman. His fingernails were painted purple, and his earlobes dripped with pearls and amethysts.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ser Franklyn did the introductions. Some of the sellsword captains bore bastard names, as Flowers did: Rivers, Hill, Stone. Others claimed names that had once loomed large in the histories of the Seven Kingdoms; Griff counted two Strongs, three Peakes, a Mudd, a Mandrake, a Lothston, a pair of Coles. Not all were genuine, he knew. In the free companies, a man could call himself whatever he chose. By any name, the sellswords displayed a rude splendor. Like many in their trade, they kept their worldly wealth upon their persons: jeweled swords, inlaid armor, heavy torcs, and fine silks were much in evidence, and every man there wore a lord's ransom in golden arm rings. Each ring signified one year's service with the Golden Company. Marq Mandrake, whose pox-scarred face had a hole in one cheek where a slave's mark had been burned away, wore a chain of golden skulls as well.</div>

<div class="line_en">"The why of it does not matter." Harry Strickland unrolled a pair of striped woolen stockings. "She is in Meereen and we are here, where the Volantenes grow daily more unhappy with our presence. We came to raise up a king and queen who would lead us home to Westeros, but this Targaryen girl seems more intent on planting olive trees than in reclaiming her father's throne. Meanwhile, her foes gather. Yunkai, New Ghis, Tolos. Bloodbeard and the Tattered Prince will both be in the field against her… and soon enough the fleets of Old Volantis will descend on her as well. What does she have? Bedslaves with sticks?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"One broken contract is stain enough upon the honor of the company." Homeless Harry Strickland paused with his blistered foot in hand. "Let me remind you, it was Myles Toyne who put his seal to this secret pact, not me. I would honor his agreement if I could, but how? It seems plain to me that the Targaryen girl is never coming west. Westeros was her father's kingdom. Meereen is hers. If she can break the Yunkai'i, she'll be Queen of Slaver's Bay. If not, she'll die long before we could hope to reach her."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“一次毁约已经玷污了一团一队的声誉，我不允许这种情况再度发生。”无家可归的哈利·斯崔克兰用手捧住起泡的脚，停下来说，“我提醒你，签下这份秘密协议的是米斯，不是我。当然，我很乐意履行协议，但你总得向我指明履行的方法吧？现在一切证据表明，那坦格利安女孩根本没心思回到西方。或许在她眼中，维斯特洛不过是她父亲的王国，弥林才是她的天下；或许她打算吞并渊凯，做一统一奴一隶湾的女王。如果情况是这样，如果她挑战失败，那她早在我们赶到前就身败名裂了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Can we walk across the waves, ser?" asked Lysono Maar. "I tell you again, we cannot reach the silver queen by sea. I slipped into Volantis myself, posing as a trader, to learn how many ships might be available to us. The harbor teems with galleys, cogs, and carracks of every sort and size, yet even so I soon found myself consorting with smugglers and pirates. We have ten thousand men in the company, as I am sure Lord Connington remembers from his years of service with us. Five hundred knights, each with three horses. Five hundred squires, with one mount apiece. And elephants, we must not forget the elephants. A pirate ship will not suffice. We would need a pirate fleet… and even if we found one, the word has come back from Slaver's Bay that Meereen has been closed off by blockade."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们学会水上漂了吗，爵士？”兰索诺·马尔不满地问，“我再说一遍：趁早打消走海路接近银女王的念头。我扮成商人，独自溜进瓦兰提斯侦察过，意图统计有多少船可资利用。港口里确实挤满了各式各样大小不一的划桨船、平底船和大帆船，但我们只能与走私者和海盗合作。克林顿大人曾在本一团一服役多年，想必很清楚底细，本一团一足有一万人，其中包一皮括五百名骑士——每名骑士备三匹马、一名侍从，每名侍从还各有一匹马——此外别忘了大象。几艘海盗船那是杯水车薪，我们需要一整支海盗舰队…即便我们能组织起这样一支舰队，根据从一奴一隶湾传回的消息，我们还要突破针对弥林城的海上封锁。”">查看中文翻译</div>
