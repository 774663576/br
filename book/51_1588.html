<div class="line_en">I make a meal out of the smaller, bonier fish that inhabit the stream down here, fill every water container and purify it, and clean my weapons. I've nine arrows left in all. I debate leaving the knife with Peeta so he'll have some protection while I'm gone, but there's really no point. He was right about camouflage being his final defense. But I still might have use for the knife. Who knows what I'll encounter?</div>

<div class="line_en">In the remaining hours before nightfall, I gather rocks and do my best to camouflage the opening of the cave. It's a slow and arduous process, but after a lot of sweating and shifting things around, I'm pretty pleased with my work. The cave now appears to be part of a larger pile of rocks, like so many in the vicinity. I can still crawl in to Peeta through a small opening, but it's undetectable from the outside. That's good, because I'll need to share that sleeping bag again tonight. Also, if I don't make it back from the feast, Peeta will be hidden but not entirely imprisoned. Although I doubt he can hang on much longer without medicine. If I die at the feast, District 12 isn't likely to have a victor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="还有几个小时，夜晚即将来临。我搬来很多石头，尽可能把洞口伪装好，活干得缓慢而艰难，我挥汗如雨，使尽浑身力气搬动着石块。终于弄完了，洞口看上去就像一大块山石的一部分，和周围的石块融为一体，我对自己的工作很满意。我仍从一个小口爬到皮塔那里，但从外面看不出来。很好，今晚我还得和皮塔共用一个睡袋。当然，如果我今晚回不来，皮塔也可以很好地隐藏自己，但又不会被困住。我怀疑他没有药物能坚持多久，如果我去赴宴会死掉，十二区也不可能有胜出者了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So cold, so bitterly cold tonight. As if the Gamemakers have sent an infusion of frozen air across the arena, which may be exactly what they've done. I lie next to Peeta in the bag, trying to absorb every bit of his fever heat. It's strange to be so physically close to someone who's so distant. Peeta might as well be back in the Capitol, or in District 12, or on the moon right now, he'd be no harder to reach. I've never felt lonelier since the Games began.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="今晚太冷了，彻骨的寒冷，大赛组织者肯定在竞技场注入了冷空气。我躺在睡袋里，皮塔的身边，尽量吸收他发热的身体散发的每一丝热量。和一个不十分亲近的人身体挨得这么近，真是一种奇怪的感觉。皮塔虽然近在咫尺，可又是那么遥不可及，就算他在凯匹特或者十二区或者在月亮上，也比此时的他离我更近些，我感到大赛开始以来还未有过的孤独。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Here are some things I'm fairly certain of. That at least Cato, Clove, and Thresh will be on hand when the feast starts. I'm not sure about Foxface since direct confrontation isn't her style or her forte. She's even smaller than I am and unarmed, unless she's picked up some weapons recently. She'll probably be hanging somewhere nearby, seeing what she can scavenge. But the other three… I'm going to have my hands full. My ability to kill at a distance is my greatest asset, but I know I'll have to go right into the thick of things to get that backpack, the one with the number 12 on it that Claudius Templesmith mentioned.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有几件事是可以肯定的，至少加图、格拉芙和萨里什在赴宴会时会有备而来。我不清楚狐狸脸怎么样，直接对抗不是她的风格，她也没有那样的实力，她手无寸铁，个头甚至比我还小，除非她最近得到了武器。此时她正在某个地方游荡，也许正瞅机会找到点什么，可另外三个人…可够我应付的。远距离射杀是我的最大优势，可我知道必须近距离，才能拿到背包，就是克劳狄斯·坦普尔史密斯提到的标有十二区号码的背包。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Just accept it will be a bad night," I tell myself. I try not to, but I can't help thinking of my mother and Prim, wondering if they'll sleep a wink tonight. At this late stage in the Games, with an important event like the feast, school will probably be canceled. My family can either watch on that static-filled old clunker of a television at home or join the crowds in the square to watch on the big, clear screens. They'll have privacy at home but support in the square. People will give them a kind word, a bit of food if they can spare it. I wonder if the baker has sought them out, especially now that Peeta and I are a team, and made good on his promise to keep my sister's belly full.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“今晚确实很糟，接受现实吧。”我对自己说。我尽量不去想妈妈和波丽姆，可思绪还是不由得飞回到她们身边去，她们今晚能合眼吗？大赛进行到后半段，又有宴会这样的重要活动，想必她们学校也都放假了。妈妈和波丽姆可以在家看那台嗡嗡响的破电视，也可以挤到人群中观看广场上清晰的大屏幕。在家里可以享受私人空间，去广场会得到很多人的支持。人们会给她们送来宽慰的话语，也可能是一些食物。面包师是否信守诺言，特别是我和皮塔结成伙伴的此时，是否能让我妹妹填饱肚子呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Spirits must be running high in District 12. We so rarely have anyone to root for at this point in the Games. Surely, people are excited about Peeta and me, especially now that we're together. If I close my eyes, I can imagine their shouts at the screens, urging us on. I see their faces -- Greasy Sae and Madge and even the Peacekeepers who buy my meat -- cheering for us.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="十二区的人一定情绪高涨，我们区以前很少有人能坚持到这一比赛阶段。我和皮塔肯定让他们很兴奋，特别是我们结盟以后。我闭上眼便可以想象他们在屏幕前呼喊，为我们鼓劲。我可以看到一张张脸——格雷茜·塞、马奇，甚至买我肉的治安警——他们都在为我们加油。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And Gale. I know him. He won't be shouting and cheering. But he'll be watching, every moment, every twist and turn, and willing me to come home. I wonder if he's hoping that Peeta makes it as well. Gale's not my boyfriend, but would he be, if I opened that door? He talked about us running away together. Was that just a practical calculation of our chances of survival away from the district? Or something more? I wonder what he makes of all this kissing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="再说盖尔，我了解他，他不会呼喊加油，只会静静地观看，时刻关注我的一举一动，渴望我能够回家。我暗自思忖他是否也希望皮塔也能回家。盖尔不是我的男朋友，可如果我敞开了心扉，他是否也乐于接受呢？他曾说过我们一起逃跑的话，这仅指我们离开十二区也能找到活路，还是另有他意？我和皮塔的亲吻，他又是怎么想的？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Through a crack in the rocks, I watch the moon cross the sky. At what I judge to be about three hours before dawn, I begin final preparations. I'm careful to leave Peeta with water and the medical kit right beside him. Nothing else will be of much use if I don't return, and even these would only prolong his life a short time. After some debate, I strip him of his jacket and zip it on over my own. He doesn't need it. Not now in the sleeping bag with his fever, and during the day, if I'm not there to remove it, he'll be roasting in it. My hands are already stiff from cold, so I take Rue's spare pair of socks, cut holes for my fingers and thumbs, and pull them on. It helps anyway. I fill her small pack with some food, a water bottle, and bandages, tuck the knife in my belt, get my bow and arrows. I'm about to leave when I remember the importance of sustaining the star-crossed lover routine and I lean over and give Peeta a long, lingering kiss. I imagine the teary sighs emanating from the Capitol and pretend to brush away a tear of my own. Then I squeeze through the opening in the rocks out into the night.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="透过石缝，我看到月亮高挂在空中，可以判断离天亮只有大约三个小时了，我做好最后的准备，我细心地把水和急救箱留在皮塔身边。如果我回不来，其他东西也没什么大用了，就算这些东西全派上用场，皮塔也只能坚持一小段时间。仔细思量之后，我把他的夹克脱下来，穿在自己身上。他不需要夹克，他在发烧，又待在睡袋里，不会冷；白天我不帮他脱下，他更会焦热无比。我的手现在已经冻僵了。我拿出露露的袜子，挖出窟窿，然后戴在手上，不管怎么说，这还管点用。我又在她的小背包里装上一些吃的、水瓶和绷带，把刀子别在腰里，拿好弓和箭。正准备离开时，忽然想起明星搭档的例行程序，于是我俯身给了皮塔长长的一吻。我想象着凯匹特人肯定已为此感动得落泪，我也假装擦掉眼中的泪水。之后，从石缝中挤出去，来到外面。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The woods always look different at night. Even with the glasses, everything has an unfamiliar slant to it. As if the daytime trees and flowers and stones had gone to bed and sent slightly more ominous versions of themselves to take their places. I don't try anything tricky, like taking a new route. I make my way back up the stream and follow the same path back to Rue's hiding place near the lake. Along the way, I see no sign of another tribute, not a puff of breath, not a quiver of a branch. Either I'm the first to arrive or the others positioned themselves last night. There's still more than an hour, maybe two, when I wriggle into the underbrush and wait for the blood to begin to flow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="夜晚的丛林总显得不同，即便戴着夜视镜看，周围的一切仍显得陌生，好像白天的树木、花草、鱼石都已沉入睡眠，悄悄潜入夜晚的是它们不详的伙伴。我不愿尝试新路线，又回到小溪，循原路来到露露在湖边的藏身地。一路上，我没发现其他选手的任何踪迹，甚至连出气的声音、树枝断裂的声音都没听到。我或者是第一个到，或者就是其他人昨晚已在此藏好。我匍匐前行，到灌木丛里藏好，一场血腥搏斗即将到来，距离这一时刻还有一个多小时，也许两个小时。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">My breath makes small white clouds as it hits the air. It's as cold as a November night at home. One where I've slipped into the woods, lantern in hand, to join Gale at some prearranged place where we'll sit bundled together, sipping herb tea from metal flasks wrapped in quilting, hoping game will pass our way as the morning comes on. Oh, Gale, I think. If only you had my back now…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我口中的哈气很快凝成白雾，很冷，就像家乡十一月的夜晚。像这样的夜晚，我常溜到林子里，和盖尔在约定地点碰头，然后挤靠着坐在一起，一边从加了棉套的金属杯中小口喝着草药茶，一边等着猎物在天亮前经过。“噢，盖尔，”我想，“你现在要在我身边该有多好…”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I move as fast as I dare. The glasses are quite remarkable, but I still sorely miss having the use of my left ear. I don't know what the explosion did, but it damaged something deep and irreparable. Never mind. If I get home, I'll be so stinking rich, I'll be able to pay someone to do my hearing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我尽量放开胆子，加快步伐。戴上夜视镜看得很清楚，可左耳失聪还是让我感到很难受。我说不清爆炸到底怎样损坏了我的听力，但肯定伤得很深，难以恢复。没关系，只要能回家，我就富得流油，我可以雇人替我听声音。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I chew a few mint leaves, my stomach isn't up for much more. Thank goodness, I have Peeta's jacket as well as my own. If not, I'd be forced to move around to stay warm. The sky turns a misty morning gray and still there's no sign of the other tributes. It's not surprising really. Everyone has distinguished themselves either by strength or deadliness or cunning. Do they suppose, I wonder, that I have Peeta with me? I doubt Foxface and Thresh even know he was wounded. All the better if they think he's covering me when I go in for the backpack.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我嚼了几片薄荷叶，肚子还不饿。感谢上帝，我穿着皮塔的夹克和自己的夹克，否则，我就不得不来回走动来保持体温。天已经亮了，阴沉沉、雾蒙蒙，其他人还是不见踪影，其实这也没什么奇怪，他们都认为自己身体强壮、杀伤力强、处事机敏。我纳闷他们是否已知道我和皮塔在一起？我猜测狐狸脸和萨里什甚至不知道他已受伤。最好他们认为我来取背包时，皮塔给我做掩护。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But where is it? The arena has lightened enough for me to remove my glasses. I can hear the morning birds singing. Isn't it time? For a second, I'm panicked that I'm at the wrong location. But no, I'm certain I remember Claudius Templesmith specifying the Cornucopia. And there it is. And here I am. So where's my feast?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是宴会在哪儿？竞技场已经大亮，我可以把眼镜摘了，清晨的鸟儿也在歌唱。难道现在时间还没到？突然间，我心里一阵发慌，我是不是来错了地方。不，我肯定听到克劳狄斯说了宙斯之角，而宙斯之角就在眼前，我就在这里。那么我们的宴会呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Just as the first ray of sun glints off the gold Cornucopia, there's a disturbance on the plain. The ground before the mouth of the horn splits in two and a round table with a snowy white cloth rises into the arena. On the table sit four backpacks, two large black ones with the numbers 2 and 11, a medium-size green one with the number 5, and a tiny orange one -- really I could carry it around my wrist -- that must be marked with a 12.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当第一缕金色的阳光照射到宙斯之角的时候，前面的空地上有了些动静。宙斯之角开口处的地面裂开了，一个铺着雪白桌布的圆桌升了上来，出现在竞技场。桌上放着四个背包，两个大黑包上标有二号和十一号，一个中号绿包上标有五号，一个小橘红色包——很小，我可以缠在手腕上——一定标着十二号。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She's cost me time, too, because by now it's clear that I must get to the table next. Anyone who beats me to it will easily scoop up my pack and be gone. Without hesitation, I sprint for the table. I can sense the emergence of danger before I see it. Fortunately, the first knife comes whizzing in on my right side so I can hear it and I'm able to deflect it with my bow. I turn, drawing back the bowstring and send an arrow straight at Clove's heart. She turns just enough to avoid a fatal hit, but the point punctures her upper left arm. Unfortunately, she throws with her right, but it's enough to slow her down a few moments, having to pull the arrow from her arm, take in the severity of the wound. I keep moving, positioning the next arrow automatically, as only someone who has hunted for years can do.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="光顾看她了，时间在飞逝，显然我应该第二个冲到桌边，任何其他人先到，就会拿走我的背包，然后逃之天天。不能迟疑，我站起身，冲了过去。这时，我可以感觉到危险在向我逼近，还好，第一把刀带着嗖嗖的声音从我身体右边冲过来，我右耳听到声音，急忙一躲，弓杆把刀子挡了出去。我扭过身，拉满弓，瞄准格拉芙的心脏射去。她一侧身，躲过了致命一击，箭尖刺伤了她左上臂。真不走运，她还可以用右手扔刀子，但这一箭也放慢了她的进攻速度，她把箭拔下来，检查伤口。我仍照直向前冲，同时像老猎手一样，娴熟地搭上第二支箭。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The table has just clicked into place when a figure darts out of the Cornucopia, snags the green backpack, and speeds off. Foxface! Leave it to her to come up with such a clever and risky idea! The rest of us are still poised around the plain, sizing up the situation, and she's got hers. She's got us trapped, too, because no one wants to chase her down, not while their own pack sits so vulnerable on the table. Foxface must have purposefully left the other packs alone, knowing that to steal one without her number would definitely bring on a pursuer. That should have been my strategy! By the time I've worked through the emotions of surprise, admiration, anger, jealousy, and frustration, I'm watching that reddish mane of hair disappear into the trees well out of shooting range. Huh. I'm always dreading the others, but maybe Foxface is the real opponent here.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="桌子咔嗒一声不动了，紧接着从宙斯之角箭也似的冲出一个人影，抓住绿包就跑。狐狸脸！真有她的，想出这么一个冒险而聪明的办法！其他人都还待在空地外围，等待合适时机，她已先声夺人，拿到背包。其他背包还放在桌子上，在一切难以预料时，大家谁也不会动。狐狸脸准是故意把其他背包放在远处，拿走一个肯定会惹来追杀者。我本该用这招！一时间，吃惊、羡慕、生气、嫉妒、沮丧，一股脑从我心里涌出。就在我迟疑的当儿，狐狸脸的棕红头发已经迅速消失在树林里，超出我的射箭范围。哈，我一直担心其他几个人，但没准我真正的对手却是她！">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I'm at the table now, my fingers closing over the tiny orange backpack. My hand slips between the straps and I yank it up on my arm, it's really too small to fit on any other part of my anatomy, and I'm turning to fire again when the second knife catches me in the forehead. It slices above my right eyebrow, opening a gash that sends a gush running down my face, blinding my eye, filling my mouth with the sharp, metallic taste of my own blood. I stagger backward but still manage to send my readied arrow in the general direction of my assailant. I know as it leaves my hands it will miss. And then Clove slams into me, knocking me flat on my back, pinning my shoulders to the ground with her knees.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我已跑到桌边，拿起小橘黄包，我把它穿到胳膊上，这么小的包只能挎在胳膊上，我转身准备再次射箭，飞来的第二把刀正好击中我的前额，刀子滑落，在我右眉骨划出一个大口子，血顺着脸流下来，挡住我的视线，嘴里有股血的铁锈味。我摇摇晃晃退后几步，想把手中的箭朝那个大致方向射过去，我清楚这样射不中。就在这时，格拉芙砰的一声把我仰面推倒在地，用膝盖压住我的肩膀。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She carelessly wipes away the blood from my wound with her jacket sleeve. For a moment, she surveys my face, tilting it from side to side as if it's a block of wood and she's deciding exactly what pattern to carve on it. I attempt to bite her hand, but she grabs the hair on the top of my head, forcing me back to the ground. "I think…" she almost purrs. "I think we'll start with your mouth."

<div class="line_en">I brace myself for the agony that's sure to follow. But as I feel the tip open the first cut at my lip, some great force yanks Clove from my body and then she's screaming. I'm too stunned at first, too unable to process what has happened. Has Peeta somehow come to my rescue? Have the Gamemakers sent in some wild animal to add to the fun? Has a hovercraft inexplicably plucked her into the air?</div>

<div class="line_en">But when I push myself up on my numb arms, I see it's none of the above. Clove is dangling a foot off the ground, imprisoned in Thresh's arms. I let out a gasp, seeing him like that, towering over me, holding Clove like a rag doll. I remember him as big, but he seems more massive, more powerful than I even recall. If anything, he seems to have gained weight in the arena. He flips Clove around and flings her onto the ground.</div>

<div class="line_en">I don't need to be told twice. I flip over and my feet dig into the hard-packed earth as I run away from Thresh and Clove and the sound of Cato's voice. Only when I reach the woods do I turn back for an instant. Thresh and both large backpacks are vanishing over the edge of the plain into the area I've never seen. Cato kneels beside Clove, spear in hand, begging her to stay with him. In a moment, he will realize it's futile, she can't be saved. I crash into the trees, repeatedly swiping away the blood that's pouring into my eye, fleeing like the wild, wounded creature I am. After a few minutes, I hear the cannon and I know that Clove has died, that Cato will be on one of our trails. Either Thresh's or mine. I'm seized with terror, weak from my head wound, shaking. I load an arrow, but Cato can throw that spear almost as far as I can shoot.</div>

I pull off Rue's socks that I've been using for gloves and press them into my forehead, trying to staunch the flow of blood, but they're soaked in minutes.</div>
