<div class="line_en">She had come late last night when it was all mysterious, dark. Now she was awake, at her old place at the breakfast table, but alone. It was very early too, not yet eight. There was this expedition -- they were going to the Lighthouse, Mr Ramsay, Cam, and James. They should have gone already -- they had to catch the tide or something. And Cam was not ready and James was not ready and Nancy had forgotten to order the sandwiches and Mr Ramsay had lost his temper and banged out of the room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她昨夜到得很晚，周围一片神秘的黑暗。现在她醒来了，坐在早餐桌旁的老位子上，但是只有她独自一人。现在时间还很早，不到八点钟。计划去远游——他们要到灯塔云，拉姆齐先生，卡姆和詹姆斯。他们应该已经出发了——他们得赶涨潮什么的。可卡姆还没准备好，詹姆斯还没准备好，南希忘了预订三明治，拉姆齐先生发了脾气，一摔门走了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">What does it mean then, what can it all mean? Lily Briscoe asked herself, wondering whether, since she had been left alone, it behoved her to go to the kitchen to fetch another cup of coffee or wait here. What does it mean?-- a catchword that was, caught up from some book, fitting her thought loosely, for she could not, this first morning with the Ramsays, contract her feelings, could only make a phrase resound to cover the blankness of her mind until these vapours had shrunk. For really, what did she feel, come back after all these years and Mrs Ramsay dead? Nothing, nothing -- nothing that she could express at all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那么，这是什么意思，这一切可能是什么意思？莉莉·布里斯柯问自己，琢磨着既然只剩下她一个人了，她是该自己到厨房去再倒一杯咖啡呢，还是该等在这里。这是什么意思，——这是一句什么书上看来的时髦话，有点适合她当时的思想，因为在和拉姆齐一家人一起的这第一个早上，她无法搞清自己的感情，只能让这个句子一再回响脑际、来掩盖脑子里的一片空白，直到忧郁的感觉减轻。因为，真的、这么多年以后重返旧地，拉姆齐夫人又已去世，她究竟感觉如何？什么也没有，什么也没有——她什么也表达不出来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Nancy had vanished. There he was, marching up and down the terrace in a rage. One seemed to hear doors slamming and voices calling all over the house. Now Nancy burst in, and asked, looking round the room, in a queer half dazed, half desperate way, "What does one send to the Lighthouse?" as if she were forcing herself to do what she despaired of ever being able to do.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="南希没影了。拉姆齐先生在那儿，怒冲冲地在平台上走来走。好像听见整幢房子里都是砰砰的摔门声和叫喊声。现在南希冲了进来，四面一看，神情古怪，半茫然半急迫地问道，“该给灯塔止的人带点什么去呢？”好像她在迫使自己去做一件她根本没有信心能做好的事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">What does one send to the Lighthouse indeed! At any other time Lily could have suggested reasonably tea, tobacco, newspapers. But this morning everything seemed so extraordinarily queer that a question like Nancy's -- What does one send to the Lighthouse?-- opened doors in one's mind that went banging and swinging to and fro and made one keep asking, in a stupefied gape, What does one send? What does one do? Why is one sitting here, after all?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="真的，给灯塔上的人带点什么去呢？在任何别的时候莉莉可以合情合理地理地建议带茶叶、烟草、报纸。但是今天早上一切显得如此出奇地怪，以至像南希的这么个问题——该结灯塔上的人带点什么去呢，——竟然在她的心里打开了一扇扇的门，它们晃来晃去，撞得砰砰响，使她不断傻呆呆地问，带点什么去？该怎么办？我究竟为什么坐在这里？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sitting alone (for Nancy went out again) among the clean cups at the long table, she felt cut off from other people, and able only to go on watching, asking, wondering. The house, the place, the morning, all seemed strangers to her. She had no attachment here, she felt, no relations with it, anything might happen, and whatever did happen, a step outside, a voice calling ("It's not in the cupboard; it's on the landing," some one cried), was a question, as if the link that usually bound things together had been cut, and they floated up here, down there, off, anyhow. How aimless it was,, how chaotic, how unreal it was, she thought, looking at her empty coffee cup. Mrs Ramsay dead; Andrew killed; Prue dead too -- repeat it as she might, it roused no feeling in her. And we all get together in a house like this on a morning like this, she said, looking out of the window. It was a beautiful still day.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="独自面对长长的餐桌上干净的杯子坐着（因为南希又出去了），她感到和别的人隔绝了，只能继续观望、提问、琢磨。这所房子、这个地方、这个早晨，似乎对她都是陌生的。她感到自己不属于这里，和这里没有关系，什么事都可能发生，而不论发生什么事——外面有脚步声，一个声音在喊（“没在碗柜里；在楼梯平台上”，有人喊道）——都是个疑问，仿佛通常将事物联系在一起的环节已被割断，他们飘上飘下，随处飘动。她看着空咖啡杯，心里想，一切都是多么茫无目的，多么混乱和虚幻。拉姆齐夫人死去了；安德鲁牺牲了；普鲁也死了——尽管她重复着这些话，却并没有引起她的感情。我们都在这样一个早晨一齐聚集到这样一所房子里，她说，眼睛看着窗外——这是个美丽宁静的早晨。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Suddenly Mr Ramsay raised his head as he passed and looked straight at her, with his distraught wild gaze which was yet so penetrating, as if he saw you, for one second, for the first time, for ever; and she pretended to drink out of her empty coffee cup so as to escape him -- to escape his demand on her, to put aside a moment longer that imperious need. And he shook his head at her, and strode on ("Alone" she heard him say, "Perished" she heard him say) and like everything else this strange morning the words became symbols, wrote themselves all over the grey-green walls. If only she could put them together, she felt, write them out in some sentence, then she would have got at the truth of things. Old Mr Carmichael came padding softly in, fetched his coffee, took his cup and made off to sit in the sun. The extraordinary unreality was frightening; but it was also exciting. Going to the Lighthouse. But what does one send to the Lighthouse? Perished. Alone. The grey-green light on the wall opposite. The empty places. Such were some of the parts, but how bring them together? she asked. As if any interruption would break the frail shape she was building on the table she turned her back to the window lest Mr Ramsay should see her. She must escape somewhere, be alone somewhere. Suddenly she remembered. When she had sat there last ten years ago there had been a little sprig or leaf pattern on the table-cloth, which she had looked at in a moment of revelation. There had been a problem about a foreground of a picture. Move the tree to the middle, she had said. She had never finished that picture. She would paint that picture now. It had been knocking about in her mind all these years. Where were her paints, she wondered? Her paints, yes. She had left them in the hall last night. She would start at once. She got up quickly, before Mr Ramsay turned.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然拉姆齐先生经过时抬起头直视着她，目光狂热激动，然而十分犀利，仿佛他第一次、刹那间看到了你，就成了永恒；为了避开他，她拿起空杯子假装喝咖啡——避开他对她的要求，把那个迫切的需求再推延片刻。他对她摇摇头，继续往前走去（“孤零零的”，她听见他在说，“死了”，她听见他在说），和这个奇特的早晨的别的一切一样，这些字句也成了象征，写满了那灰绿色的墙壁。要是她能把它们串在一起，她觉得，把它们用句子写出来，那么她就能掌握事物的真谛。老卡迈克尔先生轻轻地走了进来，倒了一杯咖啡，端着杯子走出去坐在太阳底下。那惊人的非现实令人既害怕又激动。到灯塔去。可是给灯塔上的人带点什么去呢？死了。孤零零的。对面墙上的灰绿色的光。空着的座位。这就是一些零散的部分，但怎样把它们串在一起呢？她问道，好像任何干扰都会打碎她在桌上建起的脆弱的形体，她转身背对着窗子，怕拉姆齐先生会看见她。她必须想法离开，独自躲到什么地方去。突然她记起来了，在她十年前最后坐在这里时，在桌布上有过一根小树枝或是树叶的图案，她曾在受到启示的那一刻凝视过它。当时关于一幅画的前景布局上有点问题。她曾说把树往中间挪一挪。她一直没有画完那幅画。这些年来它一直在她脑子里转。现在她再来画吧，她的颜料在哪儿？她心里想。她的颜料，对了，她昨晚留在门厅里了。她马上就动手画。在拉姆齐先生回转过来之前她很快站起身来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But with Mr Ramsay bearing down on her, she could do nothing. Every time he approached -- he was walking up and down the terrace -- ruin approached, chaos approached. She could not paint. She stooped, she turned; she took up this rag; she squeezed that tube. But all she did was to ward him off a moment. He made it impossible for her to do anything. For if she gave him the least chance, if he saw her disengaged a moment, looking his way a moment, he would be on her, saying, as he had said last night, "You find us much changed." Last night he had got up and stopped before her, and said that. Dumb and staring though they had all sat, the six children whom they used to call after the Kings and Queens of England -- the Red, the Fair, the Wicked, the Ruthless -- she felt how they raged under it. Kind old Mrs Beckwith said something sensible. But it was a house full of unrelated passions -- she had felt that all the evening. And on top of this chaos Mr Ramsay got up, pressed her hand, and said: "You will find us much changed" and none of them had moved or had spoken; but had sat there as if they were forced to let him say it. Only James (certainly the Sullen) scowled at the lamp; and Cam screwed her handkerchief round her finger. Then he reminded them that they were going to the Lighthouse tomorrow. They must be ready, with his hand on the door, he stopped; he turned upon them. Did they not want to go? he demanded. Had they dared say No (he had some reason for wanting it) he would have flung himself tragically backwards into the bitter waters of depair. Such a gift he had for gesture. He looked like a king in exile. Doggedly James said yes. Cam stumbled more wretchedly. Yes, oh, yes, they'd both be ready, they said. And it struck her, this was tragedy -- not palls, dust, and the shroud; but children coerced, their spirits subdued. James was sixteen, Cam, seventeen, perhaps. She had looked round for some one who was not there, for Mrs Ramsay, presumably. But there was only kind Mrs Beckwith turning over her sketches under the lamp. Then, being tired, her mind still rising and falling with the sea, the taste and smell that places have after long absence possessing her, the candles wavering in her eyes, she had lost herself and gone under. It was a wonderful night, starlit; the waves sounded as they went upstairs; the moon surprised them, enormous, pale, as they passed the staircase window. She had slept at once.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是拉姆齐先生这样向她逼近过来，她什么事也干不了。每一次他走近她时——他正在平台上走来走去——毁灭就走近她，混乱就走近她。她没法作画。她弯下腰，她转过身子；她拿拿这块抹布；她挤挤那管颜料。但她仅仅能一时挡开他。他使得她什么事情也干不下去。因为如果她给他丝毫机会，如果他看见她有片刻空闲，往他那个方向看上一眼，他就会没完没了，像昨晚那样，说“你看我们有很大变化吧。”昨晚他站身起来，在她面前停下，说了那么句话。尽管那六个孩子坐在那里瞪着眼睛没有出声——他们以前用英国国王和女王的名字叫这几个孩子：红发的××，美丽的××，邪恶的××，冷酷的××——但她能感到他们心里非常生气。好心的老贝克威斯太太说了几句明白事理的话。但是这幢房于里的人各自有着互不相干的强烈感情——莉莉整个晚上都感到这一点。这就够混乱的了，拉姆齐先生还要站起来紧握着她的手说：“你会看到我们有很大变化”，而别人谁也没有动，也没有说话。只有詹姆斯（无疑是阴沉的詹姆斯）怒气冲冲地瞪着灯；卡姆则把手绢儿在手指头上绕着玩。这时他提醒他们明天要到灯塔去。他们必须整七点半一切就绪到门厅里等着。然后他伸手正要开门时又停了下来，回过身来对着他们。难道他们不想去吗？他质问道。如果他们敢说不（他有某种理由想要得到这么一个回答），他就会悲惨地向后倒入绝望的苦海之中。他可有装腔作势的天才了。他看着就像一个被放逐的国王。詹姆斯倔头倔脑地说了声去，卡姆可怜地结巴着。要去，是的，他们俩会准备好的，他们说。莉莉感到这才是悲剧——不是灵枢、遗骸和寿衣；而是孩子受到强制，精神受到压抑。詹姆斯十六岁，卡姆可能是十七岁。她四下里看着，寻找着一个没有在场的人，想来是拉姆齐夫人。但是只有好心的贝克威斯太太在灯下翻看她的素描。后来，她感到累了，思绪仍在随着海水起伏，在离开了多年之后这些地方的气息和感受使她不能自持，烛光在她眼前摇曳，她忘却了自己，沉醉了。这是一个美好的夜晚，星光灿烂；他们走上楼去之时听见海浪的声音；经过楼梯平台处的窗子时，看到那轮巨大、苍白的月亮，感到很是惊异。她立刻就睡着了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She fetched herself a chair. She pitched her easel with her precise old-maidish movements on the edge of the lawn, not too close to Mr Carmichael, but close enough for his protection. Yes, it must have been precisely here that she had stood ten years ago. There was the wall; the hedge; the tree. The question was of some relation between those masses. She had borne it in her mind all these years. It seemed as if the solution had come to her: she knew now what she wanted to do.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她给自己端了一把椅子，以十足的老处女式的动作在草坪边上支起了画架，离卡迈克尔先生不能太近，但仍在受他保护的范围之内。是的，十年前她就是站在这个地方。那儿是墙；那树篱；那棵树，问题是这几片物体之间的关系。这么些年以来她心里一直惦记着这件事。看来现在她有了答案了：她知道她该怎么办了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She set her clean canvas firmly upon the easel, as a barrier, frail, but she hoped sufficiently substantial to ward off Mr Ramsay and his exactingness. She did her best to look, when his back was turned, at her picture; that line there, that mass there. But it was out of the question. Let him be fifty feet away, let him not even speak to you, let him not even see you, he permeated, he prevailed, he imposed himself. He changed everything. She could not see the colour; she could not see the lines; even with his back turned to her, she could only think, But he'll be down on me in a moment, demanding -- something she felt she could not give him. She rejected one brush; she chose another. When would those children come? When would they all be off? she fidgeted. That man, she thought, her anger rising in her, never gave; that man took. She, on the other hand, would be forced to give. Mrs Ramsay had given. Giving, giving, giving, she had died -- and had left all this. Really, she was angry with Mrs Ramsay. With the brush slightly trembling in her fingers she looked at the hedge, the step, the wall. It was all Mrs Ramsay's doing. She was dead. Here was Lily, at forty-four, wasting her time, unable to do a thing, standing there, playing at painting, playing at the one thing one did not play at, and it was all Mrs Ramsay's fault. She was dead. The step where she used to sit was empty. She was dead.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她把一块白油画布牢牢地安在画架上，作为一道屏障，尽管很脆弱，但她希望足够挡住拉姆齐先生和他的严格要求。当他背转过身去时，她就尽量去看她的画；那儿有一条线、那儿有一片景物。但是一点用处也没有。就让他在五十英尺以外，甚至不和你说话，甚至连看也不看你，他仍是无所不在，压倒一切，把自己强加于你。有他一切就变厂。她看不见色彩；她看不见线条；即使他背对着她时她想到的也只是，“可是他马上就会过来指责我、提出要求——他要求的是某种她感到无法给予他的东西。她抛下一枝画笔；选了另外一枝。那些孩子什么时候才来？他们什么时候才会出发？她感到烦躁。那个男人，她怒火中烧，心里想道，从不给予；那男人只是索取。而她则将被迫给予。拉姆齐夫人一直给予。给予、给子、给予，她死去了——留下了这一切。真的，她对拉姆齐夫人很生气。她手里的画笔微微颤抖，她看看树篱、台阶、墙壁。都是拉姆齐夫人造成的这一切。她死了。莉莉却在这里，四十四岁了，仍在浪费自己的时间，什么事也干不成；站在这里，拿绘画作为消道，拿惟一不应该用作消道的东西消遣，而这一切都是拉姆齐夫人的过错。她死了。她过去常常坐的台阶空了。她死了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But why repeat this over and over again? Why be always trying to bring up some feeling she had not got? There was a kind of blasphemy in it. It was all dry: all withered: all spent. They ought not to have asked her; she ought not to have come. One can't waste one's time at forty- four, she thought. She hated playing at painting. A brush, the one dependable thing in a world of strife, ruin, chaos -- that one should not play with, knowingly even: she detested it. But he made her. You shan't touch your canvas, he seemed to say, bearing down on her, till you've given me what I want of you. Here he was, close upon her again, greedy, distraught. Well, thought Lily in despair, letting her right hand fall at her side, it would be simpler then to have it over. Surely, she could imitate from recollection the glow, the rhapsody, the self-surrender, she had seen on so many women's faces (on Mrs Ramsay's, for instance) when on some occasion like this they blazed up -- she could remember the look on Mrs Ramsay's face -- into a rapture of sympathy, of delight in the reward they had, which, though the reason of it escaped her, evidently conferred on them the most supreme bliss of which human nature was capable. Here he was, stopped by her side. She would give him what she could.</div>
