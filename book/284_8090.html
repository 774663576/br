<div class="line_en">It was the sweetest, most mysterious-looking place any one could imagine. The high walls which shut it in were covered with the leafless stems of climbing roses which were so thick that they were matted together. Mary Lennox knew they were roses because she had seen a great many roses in India. All the ground was covered with grass of a wintry brown and out of it grew clumps of bushes which were surely rose-bushes if they were alive. There were numbers of standard roses which had so spread their branches that they were like little trees. There were other trees in the garden, and one of the things which made the place look strangest and loveliest was that climbing roses had run all over them and swung down long tendrils which made light swaying curtains, and here and there they had caught at each other or at a far-reaching branch and had crept from one tree to another and made lovely bridges of themselves. There were neither leaves nor roses on them now and Mary did not know whether they were dead or alive, but their thin gray or brown branches and sprays looked like a sort of hazy mantle spreading over everything, walls, and trees, and even brown grass, where they had fallen from their fastenings and run along the ground. It was this hazy tangle from tree to tree which made it all look so mysterious. Mary had thought it must be different from other gardens which had not been left all by themselves so long; and indeed it was different from any other place she had ever seen in her life.</div>

<div class="line_en">She moved away from the door, stepping as softly as if she were afraid of awakening some one. She was glad that there was grass under her feet and that her steps made no sounds. She walked under one of the fairy-like gray arches between the trees and looked up at the sprays and tendrils which formed them. "I wonder if they are all quite dead," she said. "Is it all a quite dead garden? I wish it wasn't."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她从门边挪开，轻手轻脚仿佛她担心会吵醒谁。好在她脚下有草，她的脚步全无声响。她从一个树木间的灰色拱门下走过，如同童话，她仰视着搭出拱门的四洒枝蔓。“我想知道它们是不是都是死的，”她想，“整个都是个死花园吗？我但愿不是。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Her skipping-rope had hung over her arm when she came in and after she had walked about for a while she thought she would skip round the whole garden, stopping when she wanted to look at things. There seemed to have been grass paths here and there, and in one or two corners there were alcoves of evergreen with stone seats or tall moss-covered flower urns in them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她进来时跳绳挂在她手臂上，她四处走了一阵后，心想她可以围着整个花园跳绳，想看东西的时候就停下来。这里那里似乎都有草径，一两处角落里有凉亭样的常绿植物，里面有石凳，或是长满苔藓的高脚石花瓶。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The sun was shining inside the four walls and the high arch of blue sky over this particular piece of Misselthwaite seemed even more brilliant and soft than it was over the moor. The robin flew down from his tree-top and hopped about or flew after her from one bush to another. He chirped a good deal and had a very busy air, as if he were showing her things. Everything was strange and silent and she seemed to be hundreds of miles away from any one, but somehow she did not feel lonely at all. All that troubled her was her wish that she knew whether all the roses were dead, or if perhaps some of them had lived and might put out leaves and buds as the weather got warmer. She did not want it to be a quite dead garden. If it were a quite alive garden, how wonderful it would be, and what thousands of roses would grow on every side!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="四墙之内，阳光明媚，高耸的蓝天在米瑟韦斯特庄园的这一带，似乎比牧尔之上更加亮丽温柔。知更鸟从树梢飞下，时而在她周围蹦跳，时而跟着她从这棵树飞到那棵树。它很叽叽喳喳了一通，一副很忙的模样，仿佛是在为她导游。一切都那么奇怪而沉默，她仿佛远离任何人有千百里，可是不知怎的她丝毫不觉得孤单。惟一困扰她的，是她想知道这些玫瑰是不是死了，或者有些也许还活着，天气转暖时可能会长叶、出蕾。她不愿意这是个死花园。假如它是个生气勃勃的花园，该是多么美妙，四边会长出怎样千万朵玫瑰啊！">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As she came near the second of these alcoves she stopped skipping. There had once been a flowerbed in it, and she thought she saw something sticking out of the black earth -- some sharp little pale green points. She remembered what Ben Weatherstaff had said and she knelt down to look at them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她来到第二个这样的常绿植物凉亭，停下来。这里面曾经有一个花床，她似乎看到什么从黑土里冒出——一些尖尖的灰绿小点。她记起季元本说过的，跪下来察看它们。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="她没有跳绳，而是走着。她慢慢地走，眼盯着地上。她察看旧日的花床里，草丛中，待她走了一圈，努力毫无遗漏，她发现许许多多尖尖的灰绿点点，她再次变得非常兴奋。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She did not know anything about gardening, but the grass seemed so thick in some of the places where the green points were pushing their way through that she thought they did not seem to have room enough to grow. She searched about until she found a rather sharp piece of wood and knelt down and dug and weeded out the weeds and grass until she made nice little clear places around them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她对园艺一窍不通，可是她看到有些地方草太深，绿点点挤着往外长，她觉得它们没有足够的空间生长。她到处搜索，找到一块很尖的木头，跪下来挖草锄草，直到她在绿点点周围弄出一片干净的空地。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The robin was tremendously busy. He was very much pleased to see gardening begun on his own estate. He had often wondered at Ben Weatherstaff. Where gardening is done all sorts of delightful things to eat are turned up with the soil. Now here was this new kind of creature who was not half Ben's size and yet had had the sense to come into his garden and begin at once.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="知更鸟极端忙碌。它很高兴看到园艺在它自己的地产上开展起来。它经常捉摸季元本。有园艺的地方，各种美味的东西都随泥土翻出来。现在这里有个新品种的动物，尺寸不到季元本一半，不过懂得一进他的花园就马上开工。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mistress Mary worked in her garden until it was time to go to her midday dinner. In fact, she was rather late in remembering, and when she put on her coat and hat, and picked up her skipping-rope, she could not believe that she had been working two or three hours.

There is no one to talk to here except you and Ben Weatherstaff. And you have to do your work and Ben Weatherstaff won't speak to me often.
