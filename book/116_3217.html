<div class="line_en">When summer came, Joseph Sedley decided that a trip to Europe would be an agreeable way of passing the time, and his sister and nephew were delighted with the plan. So they took the boat from London to Germany, accompanied of course by Major Dobbin, as a close family friend.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="夏天到了，约瑟夫·塞德利觉得去欧洲旅行是消磨时光的好方式，他妹妹和外甥也很喜欢。因此，他们从伦敦乘船去德国。当然作为这家人的亲密朋友，多宾少校也陪同前往。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Fortune now began to smile on Amelia. It was amazing how differently people behaved towards her as soon as they heard that Mr Osborne had left money to her. She found that everyone treated her with respect, that the servants were more attentive to her instructions, and that she suddenly had a wide circle of affectionate friends. Even Jos, who used to treat her as a harmless poor relation whom it was his duty to look after, became quite respectful and anxious to please her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在好运开始垂青阿梅莉亚了。一听说奥斯本先生给她留了钱，人们对待她的态度发生了多么神奇的变化啊。她发现大家都对她尊重起来，仆人对她的吩咐更加用心，突然之间她身边多了一大群对她关爱有加的朋友。甚至连乔斯，以前把她看作需要他照顾的不讨人嫌的穷亲戚，现在也对她尊重有加，急于讨好她。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Major Dobbin, who was now Georgy's guardian, often took the boy out, and the two became firm friends. Georgy admired and respected the Major and, anxious to win his approval, became less boastful and selfish in his own behaviour.</div>

<div class="line_en">For weeks they travelled through the towns along the banks of the river Rhine, visiting the sights, and enjoying themselves in their different ways. After a large lunch, Jos usually read the newspapers (or fell asleep over them), while the others went on excursions. Amelia was fond of drawing, and sat in the sunshine, drawing castles and churches. Sometimes they climbed up to a ruined tower on a hill-top, where Georgy ran about exploring, and Amelia drew the view. Dobbin carried her little chair and her sketch-book, and admired the drawings as they had never been admired before. Perhaps it was the happiest time of both their lives, if they had only known it. But who does?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="几周里，他们沿着莱茵河，在岸边的小镇一路旅行，游览风景名胜，随各自的喜好尽情享受。吃过丰盛的午餐后，乔斯通常会读报（或者读报时打盹儿），其他人则外出游玩。阿梅莉亚喜欢画画，会坐在阳光下画城堡和教堂。有时，他们爬到山顶破败的高塔上，乔基四下探险，阿梅莉亚写生。多宾替她拿小椅子和写生簿，还对画作赞不绝口，以前她的画作从未受到这样的赞美。这大概是他们两人最快乐的时光了，只可惜他们自己不知道。但是谁当时就能知道呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When they came to the little town of Pumpernickel, Jos liked it so much that he decided to stay there for the winter. They rented a pleasant house, and were welcomed into local society, receiving invitations to parties, dinners and balls.</div>

<div class="line_en">On one occasion the wedding of a local German prince took place. The town was full of visitors for the celebrations, and everybody was invited to a grand ball. Jos and his party went, including young Georgy, who watched the dancing for a while, but then got bored, and wandered away through the other rooms in search of better entertainment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有一回，当地的一位德国王公大婚，镇上到处都是前来参加庆典的访客，所有人都受邀参加盛大的舞会。乔斯一行人，包括小乔基，都去了。乔基看了一会儿跳舞，觉得没什么意思，就一个个房间转悠，想找点其他乐子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She moved on to Ostend, Florence, Rome… Through his lawyers, Rawdon was paying her three hundred pounds a year, on the condition that she never troubled him again. But when she got her money, she gambled; when she had gambled it, she had to live as best she could. Some said she gave singing lessons, and sang in theatres. Certainly, the Elephant hotel in Pumpernickel, where Joseph Sedley visited her the next day, was full of actors and entertainers and noisy young students. Becky liked the life. She was, after all, the daughter of an artist and a dancer, and was happy to drink brandy-and-water and share a joke with anyone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她又去了奥斯坦德、佛罗伦萨、罗马……罗顿通过律师每年支付给她三百英镑，条件是她再也不许去打扰他。但是她一拿到钱就去赌；赌光时，她不得不竭尽所能谋生。有人说她教唱歌，在剧院里演唱。可以确定的是，在庞普尼克尔的大象旅馆里，即约瑟夫·塞德利第二天去拜访她的地方，全是演员、艺人和吵吵闹闹的年轻学生。贝姬喜欢这种生活。她毕竟是画家和舞女的女儿，乐意喝着掺水的白兰地和人调笑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It made her feel very lonely. "If he had been here," she thought, "those cowards would never dare to insult me."

Are you accusing me of being poor, alone, and unhappy? Yes, I am guilty of those faults, and I am punished for them every day. Let me go, Emmy.

You are very good-natured, and have done your best, but you could never love me as I love you. I have waited long enough. I am tired of it. We are both tired of it. Goodbye, Amelia.

<div class="line_en">Amelia stood silent and afraid as Dobbin suddenly broke the chain by which she had held him for so long. She didn't wish to marry him, but she wished to keep him. She wished to give him nothing, but wanted him to give her everything.</div>

<div class="line_en">"What a fine man he is," she thought, "and how badly she treats him." She admired Dobbin, and was not bitter because of the things he had said about her. It was an open move in the game, and he had played it fairly. "Ah, if only I'd had a husband like that," she thought. She hurried to her room and wrote him a note in which she begged him to wait for a few days, and not to leave because, she said, she could help him with Amelia.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他是个多好的人啊。”她想，“她待他可太薄情了。”她佩服多宾，并不因为他针对她说的那些话而怀恨在心。他走的这着棋光明正大，公平在理。“啊，我要是有这么个丈夫就好了。”她想。她匆匆赶回房间，给他写了一张字条，求他先别离开，再等几天，因为关于阿梅莉亚的事她可以帮忙。">查看中文翻译</div>

Georgy jumped in after him, threw his arms round the Major's neck (as they saw from the window), and began asking him questions. Then he took the note from his pocket and gave it to him. Dobbin opened it, trembling, but then his expression changed, and he tore the note in two and dropped it out of the carriage window. Then he kissed Georgy on the head and the boy got down from the carriage, which at once moved away. Dobbin did not look up as he passed below Amelia's window.
