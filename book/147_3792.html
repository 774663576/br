<div class="line_en">He learned little of discipline. Under the care of the Leonards he came even to have a romantic contempt for it. Margaret Leonard had the marvelous vision, of great people, for essences. She saw always the dominant color, but she did not always see the shadings. She was an inspired sentimentalist. She thought she "knew boys": she was proud of her knowledge of them. In fact, however, she had little knowledge of them. She would have been stricken with horror if she could have known the wild confusion of adolescence, the sexual nightmares of puberty, the grief, the fear, the shame in which a boy broods over the dark world of his desire. She did not know that every boy, caged in from confession by his fear, is to himself a monster.</div>

<div class="line_en">He did not tell the Leonards that he was working in the early morning. He knew they would oppose his employment, and that their opposition would manifest itself in the triumphant argument of lowered grades. Also, Margaret Leonard, he knew, would talk ominously of health undermined, of the promise of future years destroyed, of the sweet lost hours of morning sleep that could never be regained. He was really more robust now than he had ever been. He was heavier and stronger. But he sometimes felt a gnawing hunger for sleep: he grew heavy at mid-day, revived in the afternoon, but found it difficult to keep his sleepy brain fixed on a book after eight o'clock in the evening.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他并没有告诉伦纳德夫妇他每天必须一大早出去干活。他知道他们要是知道了肯定会反对的，而且他们会降低学习的分数以表示对这种做法的反对态度。他也知道，玛格丽特·伦纳德还会夸张地告诫他这样下去会损害身体健康，断送了自己的前途，因为早晨的几个小时甜美睡眠一旦失去就再也补不回来了。他的身体现在比以前强健多了，体重也增加了不少，总体来看，身体更加壮实了。但有时候他却极度渴望睡觉：到正午的时候他就会昏昏欲睡，下午稍微清醒一些，但是晚上八点过后，他发现自己很难集中注意力读书了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Whatever of fear or shame locked them in careful silence, whatever decorous pretense of custom guarded their tongues, they found release in the eloquent symbols of verse. And by that sign, Margaret was lost to the good angels. For what care the ambassadors of Satan, for all the small fidelities of the letter and the word, if from the singing choir of earthly methodism we can steal a single heart -- lift up, flame-tipped, one great lost soul to the high sinfulness of poetry?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不管什么样的恐惧或者羞耻都会使彼此显得谨慎而沉默，不管二人在谈话中如何毕恭毕敬、心照不宣，他们都会在诗词美妙的象征中得到自由和解脱。正是由于这种原因，玛格丽特才会同这些小天使打成一片。尽管这些文字诗词可信度不大，但是若能用世俗说教的吟唱把一颗小小的心灵唤回来——把这个迷失的灵魂用诗来改造，让它升华到更高的境界，那么面对这些撒旦的使者，她又能在乎什么呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She did not have knowledge. But she had wisdom. She found immediately a person's quality. Boys were her heroes, her little gods. She believed that the world was to be saved, life redeemed, by one of them. She saw the flame that burns in each of them, and she guarded it. She tried somehow to reach the dark gropings toward light and articulation, of the blunt, the stolid, the shamefast. She spoke a calm low word to the trembling racehorse, and he was still.</div>

<div class="line_en">By the beginning of his fifteenth year Eugene knew almost every major lyric in the language. He possessed them to their living core, not in a handful of scattered quotations, but almost line for line. His thirst was drunken, insatiate: he added to his hoard entire scenes from Schiller's Wilhelm Tell, which he read by himself in German; the lyrics of Heine, and several folk songs. He committed to memory the entire passage in the Anabasis, the mounting and triumphal Greek which described the moment when the starving remnant of the Ten Thousand had come at length to the sea, and sent up their great cry, calling it by name. In addition, he memorized some of the sonorous stupidities of Cicero, because of the sound, and a little of Caesar, terse and lean.</div>

"From you have I been absent in the spring," and "That time of year thou mayest in me behold," the greatest of all, which Margaret brought him to, and which shot through him with such electric ecstasy when he came to "Bare ruined choirs, where late the sweet birds sang," that he could hardly hold his course unbroken through the rest of it.</div>

"My heart leaps up," "I wandered lonely as a cloud," and "Behold her, single in the field," he had known for years; but Margaret read him the sonnets and made him commit "The world is too much with us" to memory. Her voice trembled and grew low with passion when she read it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="上小学的时候，他就读过华兹华斯的一些短诗。《我的心儿在跳跃》《我如行云独自游》《瞧她，独自在田野》等，这些诗文他早就知道了。可现在玛格丽特把华兹华斯的十四行诗《世界对我们要求太多》念给他听，要他记住。她朗读的时候，为了表达自己的情感，她有意压低了颤抖的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He knew all the songs in Shakespeare's plays, but the two that moved him most were: "O mistress mine, where are you roaming?" which blew a far horn in his heart, and the great song from Cymbeline: "Fear no more the heat o' the sun." He had tried to read all the sonnets, and failed, because their woven density was too much for his experience, but he had read, and forgotten, perhaps half of them, and remembered a few which burned up from the page, strangely, immediately, like lamps for him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他对莎士比亚剧本中所有的诗歌都很熟悉。其中有两首最令他感动：一首是《哦，我的情人哟，你漫游在何处？》，这一首诗使他产生了强烈的共鸣。另一首伟大的诗歌出自《辛柏林》，名叫“不再怕那烈日炎炎”。他曾经试图把莎翁所有的十四行诗都读遍，但却没有遂愿，因为他的人生阅历还不能领悟到字里行间蕴藏的内涵。他诵读了一半，但后来都忘得差不多了，只记住了其中不多的几首，而奇怪的是，他刚一读到这几首诗，诗句就像闪耀的灯从书里映出光彩来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This sort of thing reminded him unpleasantly of the Pentlands. The Fool in "Lear" alone he thought admirable -- a sad, tragic, mysterious fool. For the rest, he went about and composed parodies, which, with a devil's grin, he told himself would split the sides of posterity. Such as: "Aye, nuncle, an if Shrove Tuesday come last Wednesday, I'll do the capon to thy cock, as Tom O'Ludgate told the shepherd when he found the cowslips gone. Dost bay with two throats, Cerberus? Down, boy, down!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="像这类台词令他十分不悦，他不禁想起彭特兰家族来。他觉得只有《李尔王》这部戏作中的小丑写得最好——那是个可怜、可悲、神秘的傻瓜。至于其余的作品，他往往戏仿别人、改头换面，自以为会让读者捧腹不已，其实不然。比如，当汤姆·奥勒盖特发现报春花不见的时候，便对牧羊人说：“哎，我的好大叔，假如忏悔星期二变成星期三，我就让阉鸡来配你的雄鸡。塞贝勒斯，你吠叫起来能否用两根喉管？坐下，阿狗，坐下！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He read all the plays save Timon, Titus Andronicus, Coriolanus, and King John, but the only play that held his interest from first to last was King Lear. With most of the famous declamatory passages he had been familiar, for years, by Gant's recitation, and now they wearied him. And all the wordy pinwheels of the clowns, which Margaret laughed at dutifully, and exhibited as specimens of the master's swingeing wit, he felt vaguely were very dull. He never had any confidence in Shakespeare's humor -- his Touchstones were not only windy fools, but dull ones.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莎翁的剧作除了《泰蒙》《泰特斯·安德隆尼克斯》《配列克里斯》《哥里阿兰纳斯》以及《约翰王》以外，其他的他全读过了。从头至尾兴趣一直不减的剧本就只有《李尔王》了。由于多年来老甘特常常喜欢朗诵莎剧中最有名的几段独白，他早就耳熟能详了，所以他现在自己阅读的时候，反倒觉得乏味无聊了。至于有些小丑所耍的语言游戏，玛格丽特会习惯性地笑几声，来展示莎翁的幽默风格。对此他觉得乏味极了。他从来都不认为莎士比亚富有幽默感——他的“经典人物”不仅都是喋喋不休的笨蛋，而且既呆板又无趣。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他对那些备受推崇、家喻户晓的莎翁名句厌烦极了，也许因为他听得太多的缘故吧；此外，他还认为莎士比亚在本该使用简洁词句的地方却使用了既荒谬又浮华的词句。比如在《哈姆雷特》一剧中，雷奥蒂斯听到皇后说她妹妹淹死时说了下面两句话：">查看中文翻译</div>

He understood; he exulted in its evil -- which was the evil of earth, of illicit nature. It was a call to the unclassed; it was a cry for those beyond the fence, for rebel angels, and for all of the men who are too tall.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这几句诗就像黑夜一般阴暗，就像“黑鬼区”一般邪恶，就像狂风怒号着横扫山坡。当他心情阴郁、不停劳作的时候，他会迎着黑暗，迎着晨风，高声吟唱这几句诗。他对诗中有关罪恶的描写非常理解，非常欣赏其中的罪恶——大地和人类不轨行为的罪恶。这是号召所有不入流者的呼声；是对那些处在围篱之外的人、叛逆的天使、身材极为高大的人发出的呐喊。">查看中文翻译</div>

All this is part of the liberal tradition. Men of the world are broadminded. Witness Professor Albert Thorndyke Firkins, of the University of Chicago, at the Falcon in Soho. Smiling bravely, he sits over a half-pint of bitter beer, in the company of a racing tout, a sway-backed barmaid, broad in the stern, with adjustable teeth, and three companionable tarts from Lisle street, who are making the best of two pints of Guinness.

You might as well expect some ignorant darky out in the fields to construe a passage in Homer."

But they did her no real injury. They were simply the things people said. She felt, guiltily, that she must trick out her teaching with these gauds: she was afraid that what she had to offer was not enough. What she had to offer was simply a feeling that was so profoundly right, so unerring, that she could no more utter great verse meanly than mean verse well. She was a voice that God seeks. She was the reed of demonic ecstasy. She was possessed, she knew not how, but she knew the moment of her possession.
