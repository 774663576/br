<div class="line_en">Their number was considerable. The Marquis de Saint-Méran, one of the most zealous and faithful dignitaries in the courts of King Louis XVIII and King Charles X, had kept a good number of friends, and these, together with people who were socially acquainted with Villefort, made up a large crowd.</div>

<div class="line_en">The authorities were immediately informed and it was agreed that the two processions could take place at once. A second hearse, decked out with the same funereal trimmings as the first, was brought to M. de Villefort's door and the coffin transferred to this funeral car from the waggon in which it had travelled.</div>

<div class="line_en">Two days later, a considerable throng gathered at around ten in the morning at M. de Villefort's door and watched a long line of funeral carriages and private coaches extending the whole length of the Faubourg Saint-Honoré and the Rue de la Pépinière. Among them there was one of peculiar shape which seemed to have travelled a long way. It was a sort of waggon, painted black, which had been one of the first to arrive for this sad appointment. On enquiry it had been learnt that, by a strange coincidence, this carriage contained the body of M. de Saint-Méran, so those who had come for a single funeral would find themselves following two bodies.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两天以后，将近早晨十点钟的时候，维尔福先生的门前聚集着很大的一群人。一长列丧车和私家马车从圣·奥诺路陆续一直伸展到庇比尼路。在那许多马车里面，有一辆车子的样式非常古怪，看来象是从远地来的。那是一种有篷的大车，车身全部漆成黑色，是最先来参加送葬的车子之一。有人问这是怎么一回事。据打听的结果，原来真是巧合得出奇：这辆车子里就藏着圣·米兰侯爵的遗体，人们最初以为只来送一个人的丧，现在却将跟在两具尸体后面走了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The two bodies were to be buried in the cemetery of Père-Lachaise, where M. de Villefort had long ago inaugurated the vault ultimately intended for his whole family.

<div class="line_cn" title="“但她是生什么病死的呢？”波香问道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Apoplexy?" said Beauchamp. "Now that's hard to believe. I too saw Madame de Saint-Méran a couple of times: she was petite, slightly built and much more of a nervous than a sanguine temperament. It's very rare for grief to produce apoplexy in a person of Madame de Saint-Méran's constitution."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“中风是很难相信的，”波香说，“圣·米兰夫人我曾见过一两次，身材很矮很瘦，是一个神经质而不是多血质的人。象圣·米兰夫人这样的体质，是很难因悲哀过度而中风的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"More or less."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“差不多。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"In any event," said Albert, "whatever the illness or the doctor who killed her, this means that Monsieur de Villefort -- or rather, Mademoiselle Valentine -- or, again, rather, our friend Franz -- can enjoy a splendid inheritance: an income of eighty thousand livres, isn't it?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“总而言之，”阿尔培说，“不论杀死她的是疾病或是医生，维尔福先生，说得准确些，凡兰蒂小姐——或说得更准确些，我们的朋友弗兰士，总之继承了一笔很可观的遗产，我相信他因此每年可多有八万里弗的收益了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Now there's a tenacious old bird," said Beauchamp. "Tenacem propositi virum. I do believe he has wagered with death that he will bury all his heirs, and, by heaven, he'll do it. He really is the old Conventionnel of '93, who told Napoleon in 1814: 'You are going down because this empire of yours is a young shoot exhausted by its own growth. Take the republic as your guide, let's go back to the battlefield with a good constitution and I promise you five hundred thousand soldiers, another Marengo and a second Austerlitz. Ideas never die, Sire, and, though they may slumber for a time, they wake up stronger than when they fell asleep.'"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那真是一个顽强的老爷爷，”波香说——“就是贺拉斯说的‘意志坚强的人’。我想，他一定和死神订过协定，要比他的后嗣都活得长久。他很象一七九三年的那个老国民议会议员，此人在一八一四年对拿破仑说：‘您之所以失败，因为您的帝国是一棵年轻的花草，由于生长得太快，所以茎子特别脆弱。且把共和国作为一个教师，让我们养好了气力再回到战场上去，我保证您可以拥有五十万军队，再来一次马伦戈之役，再得一个第二次的奥斯特利茨大捷。观念是不会绝灭的，陛下，它们有时会打一个瞌睡，但在完全睡熟以前，却会更有力地苏醒过来。’”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">More or less similar conversations were taking place in each of the carriages in the funeral procession. People were amazed at these two deaths, so sudden and so close together, but no one suspected the terrible secret which M. d'Avrigny had revealed to M. de Villefort in their midnight walk.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在所有的车子里，人们的谈话几乎都是如此。这两个死讯来得这样突兀，而且这样迅速地接连到来，所以每一个人都很惊奇；但谁都没有怀疑到阿夫里尼先生在黑夜里告诉维尔福先生的那种可怕的秘密。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It appears that for him men are like ideas," said Albert. "There's only one thing bothering me, which is how Franz d'Epinay will get on with a grandfather-in-law who cannot do without Franz's wife. By the way, where is Franz?"</div>

<div class="line_en">After a drive of about an hour they reached the cemetery gates. The weather was calm but overcast, and so quite appropriate for the dismal ceremony that they had come to perform. Among the groups going towards the family vault Château-Renaud recognized Morrel, who had come alone and in a cab. He was walking by himself, very pale and silent, along the little path lined with yews.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们约莫在一小时内到达坟场。天气温和而晦黯，很适宜于举行丧礼。在那一群向家墓拥过去的人堆里，夏多·勒诺认出了摩莱尔，他是独自乘着一辆轻便马车来的。他的脸色很苍白，正在默默地沿着那条两旁水松夹持的小径走。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Fine dwelling," said Beauchamp, glancing at the mausoleum. "Summer palace, winter palace. You'll live there yourself in the end, my dear d'Epinay, as you're soon going to be one of the family. As for me, philosopher that I am, I should like a little country house, a cottage far away under the trees, with less hewn stone on my poor corpse. When I die, I shall say to those about my deathbed what Voltaire wrote to Pirron: eo rus; and that will be it. Dammit, Franz, cheer up! Your wife's an heiress."</div>

<div class="line_en">These apparently simple words broke Morrel's heart. Had this man seen Valentine, had he spoken to her? The ardent young officer needed all his strength to resist the desire to break his vow. Instead he took Château-Renaud's arm and led him quickly towards the vault, in front of which the undertakers had just put down the two coffins.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这几句表面上很简单的话刺痛了摩莱尔的心。那末，这个人曾见过凡兰蒂，而且还和她说过话！这位高傲的青年军官须得用他的全部脑力才能阻止自己破坏自己的诺言。他挽起夏多·勒诺的手臂，转身向坟墓走去，送丧的人已经把那两具棺材抬进坟墓里面去了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I must say, Beauchamp," said Franz, "you are impossible. Politics have accustomed you to laugh at everything, and men who administer affairs usually don't believe in anything.

<div class="line_en">The Villefort family vault consisted of a square of white stones, rising to a height of about twenty feet. An inner wall divided the families of Saint-Méran and Villefort into two compartments, each with its own entrance. Inside, there were none of those base drawers, one above the other, as in other tombs, which allow the dead to be packed in economically with an inscription like a label on each one. All that one could see at first through the bronze door was an austere, dark antechamber, separated from the tomb itself by a wall. It was in the middle of this wall that the two doors we mentioned were set, giving entrance to the Villefort and Saint-Méran family sepulchres.</div>

Franz remained at the gate of the cemetery with M. de Villefort. Morrel stopped on the first excuse and saw the two of them leaving in one of the funerary carriages; he found this tête-à-tête ominous.

You know that the affairs of the deceased are entirely in order and that her will bequeaths to Valentine the entire fortune of the Saint-Mérans.

Mademoiselle de Villefort can retire for the appropriate three months into her estate at Saint-Méran -- I say, her estate, because from now on it belongs to her. There, in a week if you wish, quietly and with a minimum of ceremony, we can conduct the civil wedding. It was Madame de Saint-Méran's desire that her granddaughter should be married on the estate. Once the marriage has been concluded, Monsieur, you can return to Paris, and your wife will spend the period of mourning with her stepmother."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“别怕，”维尔福回答。“舍下对于礼制决不会疏忽。在那三个月守制的期间，维尔福小姐可以到圣·米兰去，住在她的庄园里——我说‘她的庄园’，因为那处产业是属于她的。在一个星期之内，假如您愿意的话，就可以在那儿成婚，我们不铺张，也不请客。圣·米兰夫人希望她的外孙女儿在那里结婚。婚礼完毕以后，阁下，您就可以回到巴黎来，而您的妻子则和她的继母一同度过她守制的时间。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"In any event, Monsieur," Villefort said to his future son-in-law, "apart from the loss of this portion of your expectations, there is nothing in this unexpected will which is to your discredit; it may be explained by Monsieur Noirtier's weakness of mind. What displeases my father is not that Mademoiselle de Villefort is marrying you, but that she is marrying at all. Her marriage to any other man would have caused him equal displeasure. Old age is selfish, Monsieur, and Mademoiselle de Villefort was a devoted companion to Monsieur Noirtier in a way that the Baroness d'Epinay can no longer be. My father's unfortunate state means that people seldom discuss serious matters with him, the feebleness of his wits not allowing him to follow such conversations. I am quite convinced that at the moment, while he is aware that his granddaughter is getting married, Monsieur Noirtier has even forgotten the name of the man who is to become his grandson."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“而且，阁下，”维尔福对他的未来女婿说，“您的预期除了在这方面受了一部份损失以外，这一份出人意外的遗嘱对您个人并没什么恶意，这完全是诺梯埃先生头脑衰弱的结果。他所不高兴的，并不是因为凡兰蒂小姐要嫁给您，而是因为她要嫁人，不论嫁给哪一个人，他都会同样的伤心。老年人是自私的，阁下，维尔福小姐一向是诺梯埃先生忠实的侣伴，当她成为伊辟楠男爵夫人的时候，那就不能了。家父的情形很可哀，由于他的头脑衰弱，理解力贫乏，所以许多事情我们不能和他谈，我确信在目前这个时候，虽然诺梯埃先生知道他的孙女快要结婚，但他一定甚至把他未来孙女婿的名字都忘记了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
