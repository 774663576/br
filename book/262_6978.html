<div class="line_en">John was sad to see her go. He had enjoyed working with her, and she had come to his house several times over the last year and a half. His children liked her now. They had never been so friendly with any woman, since their mother had died.</div>

She knew that the cleaning machines would never be built.</div>

There were two big, new shops in the town as well, and a new the－atre, and a lot of new houses. 'And it's all because of you,' he said. 'It's wonderful, Mary, don't you think?'
