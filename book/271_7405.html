<div class="line_en">The Cullens' enormous house was more crowded with guests than anyone would assume could possibly be comfortable. It only worked out because none of the visitors slept. Mealtimes were dicey, though. Our company cooperated as best they could. They gave Forks and La Push a wide berth, only hunting out of state; Edward was a gracious host, lending out his cars as needed without so much as a wince. The compromise made me very uncomfortable, though I tried to tell myself that they'd all be hunting somewhere in the world, regardless.</div>

<div class="line_en">We'd replayed the scene of Renesmee's introduction to the Denali coven a half dozen times. First for Peter and Charlotte, whom Alice and Jasper had sent our way without giving them any explanation at all; like most people who knew Alice, they trusted her instructions despite the lack of information.

<div class="line_en">Benjamin -- an oddly cheerful vampire who looked barely older than a boy and seemed both utterly confident and utterly careless at the same time -- persuaded Amun to stay with a few subtle threats about disbanding their alliance. Amun stayed, but continued to refuse to touch Renesmee, and would not allow his mate, Kebi, to touch her, either. It seemed an unlikely grouping -- though the Egyptians all looked so alike, with their midnight hair and olive-toned pallor, that they easily could have passed for a biological family. Amun was the senior member and the outspoken leader. Kebi never strayed farther away from Amun than his shadow, and I never heard her speak a single word. Tia, Benjamin's mate, was a quiet woman as well, though when she did speak there was great insight and gravity to everything she said. Still, it was Benjamin whom they all seemed to revolve around, as if he had some invisible magnetism the others depended upon for their balance. I saw Eleazar staring at the boy with wide eyes and assumed Benjamin had a talent that drew the others to him.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Irish clan arrived first, and they were surprisingly easy to convince. Siobhan -- a woman of immense presence whose huge body was both beautiful and mesmerizing as it moved in smooth undulations -- was the leader, but she and her hard-faced mate, Liam, were long used to trusting the judgment of their newest coven member. Little Maggie, with her bouncy red curls, was not physically imposing like the other two, but she had a gift for knowing when she was being lied to, and her verdicts were never contested. Maggie declared that Edward spoke the truth, and so Siobhan and Liam accepted our story absolutely before even touching Renesmee.</div>

<div class="line_en">"It's not that," Edward told me when we were alone that night. "His gift is so singular that Amun is terrified of losing him.

<div class="line_en">Garrett came first -- a tall, rangy vampire with eager ruby eyes and long sandy hair he kept tied back with a leather thong -- and it was apparent immediately that he was an adventurer. I imagined that we could have presented him with any challenge and he would have accepted, just to test himself. He fell in quickly with the Denali sisters, asking endless questions about their unusual lifestyle. I wondered if vegetarianism was another challenge he would try, just to see if he could do it.</div>

<div class="line_en">The brooding dark-haired vampire took Carlisle at his word about Renesmee's origins, refusing, like Amun, to touch her. Edward told Carlisle, Esme, and me that Alistair was afraid to be here, but more afraid of not knowing the outcome. He was deeply suspicious of all authority, and therefore naturally suspicious of the Volturi. What was happening now seemed to confirm all his fears.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个忧心忡忡的深色头发吸血鬼接受了卡莱尔对蕾妮斯梅事情的解释，但和阿蒙一样，就是不肯碰她。爱德华告诉卡莱尔、埃斯梅和我，其实阿利斯泰尔根本不想来这，但他更怕错过了这事件的结果。他不信任任何官僚权威，当然也不信任沃尔图里。而现在这里发生的一切，正是证实他怀疑的好机会。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Carlisle and Esme returned a week after they had gone, Emmett and Rosalie just a few days later, and all of us felt better when they were home. Carlisle brought one more friend home with him, though friend might have been the wrong term. Alistair was a misanthropic English vampire who counted Carlisle as his closest acquaintance, though he could hardly stand a visit more than once a century. Alistair very much preferred to wander alone, and Carlisle had called in a lot of favors to get him here. He shunned all company, and it was clear he didn't have any admirers in the gathered covens.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡莱尔和埃斯梅在出去一周后回来了，埃美特和罗莎莉只晚了几天，我们大家都为他们的归来松了口气。卡莱尔还多带了个朋友回来，虽然那朋友感觉自己像是上了贼船。阿利斯泰尔，一个不大爱交际的英国籍吸血鬼，虽然他们一百年也难得见面一次，却把卡莱尔当做自己最最亲密的朋友。阿利斯泰尔特别喜欢独处，卡莱尔花了很多功夫才把他叫了过来。他向来都是避免与团体接触，所以很明显在这一堆人里不怎么受欢迎。">查看中文翻译</div>

What a fine way to treat your friends."</div>

<div class="line_en">But if he was right about having to run from the Volturi, at least he had more hope of doing that than the rest of us.

Both of them seemed as if they'd been stretched -- long arms and legs, long fingers, long black braids, and long faces with long noses. They wore nothing but animal skins -- hide vests and tight-fitting pants that laced on the sides with leather ties. It wasn't just their eccentric clothes that made them seem wild but everything about them, from their restless crimson eyes to their sudden, darting movements.

<div class="line_en">"Alice told us we needed to separate," Zafrina answered in the rough, deep voice that matched her wild appearance. "It's uncomfortable to be away from each other, but Alice assured us that you needed us here, while she very much needed Kachiri somewhere else. That's all she would tell us, except that there was a great hurry…?" Zafrina's statement trailed off into a question, and -- with the tremor of nerves that never went away no matter how often I did this -- I brought Renesmee out to meet them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“爱丽丝说我们得分开走，”查弗丽娜用那种和她野性外表十分相称的粗野低沉的声音说道。“彼此分开的感觉真不好，但爱丽丝坚持说你们很需要我们俩，而她得和卡叽里到其他地方去。爱丽丝只告诉我们这里发生了一些要紧事…？”在我带着蕾妮斯梅出场时，查弗丽娜的陈述句变成了问句。无论这动作重复了多少次，我剧烈的紧张感从未消失过。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Despite their fierce appearance, they listened very calmly to our story, and then allowed Renesmee to prove the point. They were every bit as taken with Renesmee as any of the other vampires, but I couldn't help worrying as I watched their swift, jerky movements so close beside her. Senna was always near Zafrina, never speaking, but it wasn't the same as Amun and Kebi.

<div class="line_en">"It's a very straightforward illusion," Edward explained when it turned out that I couldn't see anything, as usual. Zafrina was intrigued and amused by my immunity -- something she'd never encountered before -- and she hovered restlessly while Edward described what I was missing. Edward's eyes unfocused slightly as he continued. "She can make most people see whatever she wants them to see -- see that, and nothing else.

<div class="line_en">"Kate," I growled. I rested my hand on the small of Edward's back. I could still feel my shield like a strong, flexible sheet around Renesmee and me. I pushed it farther, forcing it around Edward. There was no sign of a flaw in the stretchy fabric, no threat of a tear. I panted with the effort, and my words came out sounding breathless rather than furious. "Again," I said to Kate. "Edward only."</div>

<div class="line_en">My fury had almost entirely ebbed, and I clenched my teeth together, panting faster as I pushed out against the elastic shield; it felt like it was getting heavier the longer I held it. It pulled back, dragging inward.</div>

I locked my jaw and shoved, trying to heave the resisting, resilient safeguard farther from myself.

<div class="line_en">"Maybe," Kate said, her face suddenly serious. "Maybe it only works on the weak or the young. I'm not sure. You look strong, though. Perhaps you could withstand my gift."

<div class="line_cn" title="“也许吧，”凯特说，突然严肃起来。“也许这能力只对老弱病残起作用。我不肯定。你还挺壮的，应该经得住我一下吧。”说着向他伸出手，抬起手掌——明显的挑衅。她的嘴唇稍稍抽动，我百分百确定她是想轰走他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Kate," Garrett called as the others murmured and drifted slightly away, disturbed by the moment of blindness; vampires were not used to feeling vulnerable. The tall, sandy -- haired Garrett was the only non-gifted immortal who seemed drawn to my practice sessions. I wondered what the lure was for the adventurer.</div>

I couldn't be sure about that, as I had never seen the Volturi except with human eyes; I could not make a perfect comparison. Their sharp, narrow eyes were dark burgundy, with no milky film. They wore very simple black clothes that could pass as modern but hinted at older designs.</div>
