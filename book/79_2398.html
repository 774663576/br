<div class="line_en">Jack had stood on the stairs, listening to the crooning, comforting sounds coming muffled through the locked door, and slowly his confusion had given way to anger. Things had never really changed. Not to Wendy. He could be off the juice for twenty years and still when he came home at night and she embraced him at the door, he would see/ sense that little flare of her nostrils as she tried to divine scotch or gin fumes riding the outbound train of his exhalation. She was always going to assume the worst; if he and Danny got in a car accident with a drunken blindman who. had had a stroke just before the collision, she would silently blame Danny's injuries on him and turn away.</div>

<div class="line_en">Yes, maybe at first. He had been a lush, he had done terrible things. Breaking Danny's arm had been a terrible thing. But if a man reforms, doesn't he deserve to have his reformation credited sooner or later? And if he doesn't get it, doesn't he deserve the game to go with the name? If a father constantly accuses his virginal daughter of screwing every boy in junior high, must she not at last grow weary (enough) of it to earn her scoldings? And if a wife secretly -- and not so secretly -- continues to believe that her teetotaling husband is a drunk…</div>

<div class="line_en">Jack walked among the tables, momentarily forgetting his wife and son upstairs, forgetting the dream, the smashed radio, the bruises. He trailed his fingers over the slick plastic dustcovers, trying to imagine how it must have been on that hot August night in 1945, the war won, the future stretching ahead so various and new, like a land of dreams. The bright and particolored Japanese lanterns hung the whole length of the circular drive, the golden-yellow light spilling from these high windows that were now drifted over with snow. Men and women in costume, here a glittering princess, there a high-booted cavalier, flashing jewelry and flashing wit everywhere, dancing, liquor flowing freely, first wine and then cocktails and then perhaps boilermakers the level of conversation going up and up and up until the jolly cry rang out from the bandmaster's podium, the cry of "Unmask!

<div class="line_en">He found himself standing on the other side of the dining room, just outside the stylized batwing doors of the Colorado Lounge where, on that night in 1945, all the booze would have been free.</div>

<div class="line_en">But now, lit only murkily by the light which filtered through from the dining room (which was itself only dimly lit because of the snow blocking the windows), he thought he saw ranks and ranks of bottles twinkling mutedly behind the bar, and syphons, and even beer dripping from the spigots of all three highly polished taps. Yes, he could even smell beer, that damp and fermented and yeasty odor, no different from the smell that had hung finely misted around his father's face every night when he came home from work.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是现在，在酒吧间微弱的光线中，他仿佛看见柜台后面摆满了一排排酒瓶——全都闪着幽幽的光辉，还有苏打水，三个锃亮的啤酒阀滴淌着啤酒。是的，他甚至闻到了啤酒的芳香，是那种润泽的微微发酸的酵母味儿，和他父亲每天夜里下班回家时脸上散发出的细腻湿润的气味并无二致。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The shelves were all empty. They had not even as yet gathered a good coat of dust. The beer taps were dry, as were the chrome drains beneath them. To his left and right, the velvet-upholstered booths stood like men with high backs, each one designed to give a maximum of privacy to the couple inside. Straight ahead, across the red-carpeted floor, forty barstools stood around the horseshoe-shaped bar. Each stool was upholstered in leather and embossed with cattle brands-Circle H, Bar D Bar (that was fitting), Rocking W, Lazy B.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="货架上空荡荡的，上面连积下的灰尘都算不上厚。啤酒阀和下面的镀铬漏槽都干干爽爽的。他的左边和右边各有一溜包天鹅绒的小包间，每一间都可以最大限度地为里面的一对儿提供一个小天地。他的正前方，红地毯的另一端，环绕马蹄形的酒吧柜台摆放着40张圆凳，凳子上裹着皮革，皮革上的烙印清晰可见。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was like that day on the playground when… but there was no sense in thinking about that. Still he could have sworn he had seen those bottles, vaguely, it was true, the way you see the darkened shapes of furniture in a room where the curtains have been drawn. Mild glints on glass. The only thing that remained was that smell of beer, and Jack knew that was a smell that faded into the woodwork of every bar in the world after a certain period of time, not to be eradicated by any cleaner invented. Yet the smell here seemed sharp… almost fresh.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他满怀着痴心妄想往货架上瞟了一眼，可架子上和从前一样空空如也。他沮丧地苦笑了一下，慢慢握紧拳头，指甲在柜台的皮革边缘上留下了纤细的划痕。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The first bar he'd been in for nineteen months and the damned thing was dry -- just his luck. All the same, a bitterly powerful wave of nostalgia swept over him, and the physical craving for a drink seemed to work itself up from his belly to his throat to his mouth and nose, shriveling and wrinkling the tissues as it went, making them cry out for something wet and long and cold.</div>

When you jump on, it seems like the brightest, cleanest Wagon you ever saw, with ten-foot wheels to keep the bed of it high out of the gutter where all the drunks are laying around with their brown bags and their Thunderbird and their Granddad Flash's Popskull Bourbon. You're away from all the people who throw you nasty looks and tell you to clean up your act or go put it on in another town. From the gutter, that's the finest-lookin Wagon you ever saw, Lloyd my boy. All hung with bunting and a brass band in front and three majorettes to each side, twirling their batons and flashing their panties at you. Man, you got to get on that Wagon and away from the juicers that are straining canned heat and smelling their own puke to get high again and poking along the gutter for butts with half an inch left below the filter."</div>

<div class="line_en">"So you climb up," he told Lloyd. "and ain't you glad to be there. My God yes, that's affirmative. That Wagon is the biggest and best float in the whole parade, and everybody is lining the streets and clapping and cheering and waving, all for you. Except for the winos passed out in the gutter. Those guys used to be your friends, but that's all behind you now."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“于是，你爬了上去，”他告诉劳埃德。“高兴吗？噢，上帝，高兴，答案是肯定的。那辆马车是整个游行队伍里最大最好的，每个人都站在街道两边为你鼓掌、欢呼、招手，除了那些昏睡在街沟里的酒鬼。那些家伙过去都是你的朋友，但现在那一切都已经成为过去。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Then you start to see things, Lloydy-my-boy. Things you missed from the gutter. Like how the floor of the Wagon is nothing but straight pine boards, so fresh they're still bleeding sap, and if you took your shoes off you'd be sure to get a splinter. Like how the only furniture in the Wagon is these long benches with high backs and no cushions to sit on, and in fact they are nothing but pews with a songbook every five feet or so. Like how all the people sitting in the pews on the Wagon are these flatchested el birdos in long dresses with a little lace around the collar and their hair pulled back into buns until it's so tight you can almost hear it screaming. And every face is fiat and pale and shiny, and they're all singing `Shall we gather at the riiiiver, the beautiful, the beautiful, the riiiiiver,' and up front there's this reekin bitch with blond hair playing the organ and tellin em to sing louder, sing louder. And somebody slams a songbook into your hands and says, `Sing it out, brother. If you expect to stay on this Wagon, you got to sing morning, noon, and night. Especially at night.' And that's when you realize what the Wagon really is, Lloyd. It's a church with bars on the windows, a church for women and a prison for you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“然后，你开始看到一些真相，这些都是在排水沟看不到的。比如说，马车的地板原来只是些松木板，新鲜得还在流松脂。又比如，车上只有几张长靠背椅，连坐垫都没有，椅子上每隔大约5英尺就有一本唱诗集。再比如，坐在长椅上的人都是些胸脯平坦的老处女，她们穿着长袍，领口上系条小带子，头发往后梳成小面包卷儿，紧绷绷的，好像在呻吟。她们的脸清一色地扁平、没有血色，而且亮光光的，她们唱着‘让我们聚会在河边，美丽的，美丽的河流’，前面有个臭娘们儿拉着风琴，告诉她们声音再高一点，再高一点。有人会塞给你一本唱诗集，说，‘唱起来，老兄。要想呆在这辆马车上，你就得早上唱，中午唱，晚上唱，尤其是要在晚上唱。’这时你才了解到那辆车是什么玩意儿。那是一座钉死了窗户的教室，娘儿们的教堂，男人的监狱。”">查看中文翻译</div>

A pulse beat noticeably in the center of his forehead. In the very center of him a cold certainty was forming and the certainty was that he was losing his mind. He felt an urge to pick up the bar stool next to him, reverse it, and go through the place like an avenging whirlwind. Instead he whirled back around to the bar and began to bellow:</div>
