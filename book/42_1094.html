<div class="line_en">Stanley had no trouble falling asleep, but morning came much too quickly. Every, muscle and joint in his body ached as he tried to get out of bed. He didn't think it was possible but his body hurt more than it had the day before. It wasn't just his arms and back, but his legs, ankles, and waist also hurt. The only thing that got him out of bed was knowing that every second he wasted meant he was one second closer to the rising of the sun. He hated the sun.</div>

<div class="line_en">He could hardly lift his spoon during breakfast, and then he was out on the lake, his spoon replaced by a shovel. He found a crack in the ground, and began his second hole.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吃早餐时，他差点连勺子都提不起来。饭后，他去了湖上，手中的勺子换成了铲子。他在地上找了条裂缝，开始挖第二个洞。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As he dug, he was careful to dump the dirt far away from the hole. He needed to save the area around the hole for when his hole was much deeper.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他边挖边小心翼翼地将土堆在远处。他还得留神把洞周围的地方空出来，好让洞挖得更深。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He stepped on the shovel blade, and pushed on the very back of the shaft with the base of his thumb. This hurt less than trying to hold the shaft with his blistered fingers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他踩在铲子上，用大拇指顶着铲柄。比起用满是水泡的手指握住铲柄，这样做就没那么疼了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He didn't know if he'd ever get that far. X-Ray was right. The second hole was the hardest. It would take a miracle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他不知道自己能不能挖那么深。X光说得没错。第二个洞才是最难挖的。能挖出来就是奇迹了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As long as the sun wasn't out yet, he removed his cap and used it to help protect his hands. Once the sun rose, he would have to put it back on his head. His neck and forehead had been badly burned the day before.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="太阳还没有升起来，他把帽子摘下来，用来护手。一旦太阳升起，他就得把帽子戴回头上。他的脖子和额头前一天全被晒伤了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He grunted as he tried to stick his shovel into the dirt. His cap slipped out from under his fingers, and the shovel fell free.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他一边将铲子插进土里，一边嘟囔着。指尖的帽子滑落了，铲子也脱手了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He took it one shovelful at a time, and tried not to think of the awesome task that lay ahead of him. After an hour or so, his sore muscles seemed to loosen up a little bit.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯坦利一铲一铲地挖着，尽量不去想还有可怕的任务等着他。大约过了一个钟头，他酸痛的肌肉似乎松弛了一点。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He took a drink from his canteen. He guessed that the water truck should be coming soon, but he didn't finish all the water, just in case he was wrong. He'd learned to wait until he saw the truck, before drinking the last drop.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他喝了一口水。他猜送水车应该快来了，但他没将水一饮而尽，以防万一。他已经学聪明了，一定要等到看见送水车，才把最后一滴水喝光。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He reached down to pick up his cap, and there next to it he saw a wide flat rock. As he put his cap on his head, he continued to look down at the rock.</div>

<div class="line_en">He looked at the barren land all around him. True, everyone referred to this area as "the lake," but it was still hard to believe that this dry wasteland was once full of water.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他看着周围荒芜的土地。的确如此，每个人都把这里称为“湖”，可还是很难相信这片干涸的荒地曾经湖水丰盈。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He looked back down at his fish. He'd found his miracle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他又低头看了看手里的鱼。他发现了属于自己的奇迹。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The truck stopped and the boys lined up. They always lined up in the same order, Stanley realized, no matter who got there first. X-Ray was always at the front of the line. Then came Armpit, Squid, Zigzag, Magnet, and Zero.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="小货车停了，男孩们排好了队。斯坦利发现，无论谁最先赶到小货车那儿，队伍的顺序总是不变的。X光排在第一个，接着是胳肢窝、乌贼、锯齿、吸铁石和零蛋。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He rubbed off some dirt, and the outline of the fish became clearer. The sun peeked over the horizon, and he could actually see tiny lines where every one of the fish's bones had been.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他擦掉了一些灰，鱼的轮廓更清晰了。太阳升上了地平线，他真真切切看到了石头上鱼刺的细痕。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then he remembered what Mr. Sir and Mr. Pendanski had both said. If he dug up anything interesting, he should report it to one of them. If the Warden liked it, he would get the rest of the day off.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他顿时想起了长官先生和潘登斯基先生都叮嘱过的事情——如果挖到有趣的东西，得向他们中的一个报告。如果管理员大人对那东西感兴趣，那么这一天余下的时间他就可以休息了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He continued to dig, though very slowly, as he waited for the water truck. He didn't want to bring attention to his find, afraid that one of the other boys might try to take it from him. He tossed the rock, face down, beside his dirt pile, as if it had no special value. A short while later he saw the cloud of dirt heading across the lake.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他继续挖着，但是速度慢多了，因为他在等送水车。他不想让自己的发现引起别的孩子的注意，担心其他孩子会把东西抢走。他把石面朝下，扔到洞外的土堆旁，装作那东西一钱不值。没过多久，他看见一股滚滚的尘土朝这儿卷过来。">查看中文翻译</div>
