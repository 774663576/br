<div class="line_en">Beside her, Tristan remained silent and tense, moving quickly and glancing constantly around. His stress triggered her own. She didn't dare look at her surroundings, but stared straight ahead and willed them to pass through without incident.</div>

<div class="line_en">It should have been a fairly pleasant walk through the valley. The path was flat and wide, made of little pebbles that made Dylan think of country walks down long abandoned railway lines. It wound its way gracefully down the trough between the two hills. The sides did not feel confined or restricted, but gently undulated upward, covered with short grass and wild flowers. It was picture perfect. Or would have been if it wasn't for the sheer cliff walls that erupted from the grassy slopes. The cliffs curved inwards as they rose up and pinched the sky until it was little more than a narrow slit of light that wasn't quite bright enough to banish the shadows that pooled across the ground. Darkness enveloped this place. Dylan shivered as the cold shade embraced her.</div>

<div class="line_en">In her peripheral vision she could just make out the swooping blur of bats. No, not bats, she realised. Wraiths. They scythed down the rocky face then circled low overhead. Dylan gripped Tristan's fingers tightly, trying not to look at them.</div>

<div class="line_en">It sounded like the gentle rumbling of a thousand whispers. Although there were no distinct words, the sound was nonetheless menacing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这声音听起来像是一千个人在窃窃私语。尽管听不清说的什么，但却来势汹汹。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Can you hear that?" she asked tersely.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你听得到吗？”她简短地问了一句。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What is it?" she warbled. Her head jerked about as she scanned the sky, the cliffs, hunting for the source of the noise.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“不是从上面发出来的，”崔斯坦告诉她，“在我们下面，你听一下地面。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It seemed a strange request to Dylan, but she tried to concentrate on sounds that might be coming from underneath her feet. At first the only sound she could hear was the crunching of their feet disturbing the gravel and small pebbles that littered the trail, but now that she was listening for it, she realised the eerie hissing was, in fact, coming from beneath them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对迪伦来说，这个要求太古怪了，但她还是凝神静气注意聆听可能会从她脚下发出的声音。一开始，她只能听到自己的脚嘎吱嘎吱地踏过散落在路上的沙砾和小石子时发出的声音。可是现在当她特意倾听时，才发觉那些古怪的嘶嘶声真的来自脚下。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But she couldn't ignore them. She found herself listening for the familiar but haunting howling that she now associated with the demons, but there was no high-pitched wailing echoing in the air. There were, however, other noises.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但她无法对它们视而不见。她觉得自己又听到了那熟悉而瘆人的吼叫。她现在一听到这样的叫声就会联想到恶魔。但空气中回荡的并不是那种高亢的哀号，而是另外一种噪声。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"As soon as we're deep enough in shadow, they'll strike. They don't need night, not here." His voice was matter-of-fact, but there was a note of panic there that frightened Dylan more than the words he was speaking.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“一旦我们在阴影里走得够深，它们就会袭击我们。在这里，它们无须黑夜。”他的声音非常严肃，但那种恐怖的语气比他说话的内容更让迪伦觉得不寒而栗。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他惨笑一声说：“什么都不做。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"We're in the heart of the wasteland," Tristan explained. "This is where they lurk, thousands of them. The shadows almost never die here. They know they'll get their chance."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们现在位于荒原的中心，”崔斯坦解释说，“这是成千上万的恶魔潜伏的地方，阴影在这里几乎永远不会消失。它们知道在这里有机会得逞。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Shouldn't we run?" Dylan was not a strong runner. Though thin, she was not fit. Exercise had never been part of her daily routine, and enforced PE lessons had been torture. She had always insisted that she would only run if she were being chased. This situation seemed to qualify, she thought ruefully.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“难道我们不应该赶紧跑吗？”迪伦并不怎么擅长跑步。尽管她身材不胖，但身体并不怎么好。她没有锻炼的习惯，学校开设的体育课更是一种折磨。她一直觉得自己要是被人追赶，就只能拼命地跑。她悲哀地想，看样子现在是时候逃跑了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Hold on to me, Dylan. Don't let go. And when I tell you to run -- run. You follow the path, and when you're through the valley there's another cottage. You run towards it and you don't look back. Once you're through the door, you're safe."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“紧紧抓住我，迪伦。别放手。我告诉你该跑的时候，马上跑。你沿着这条路，穿过山谷就有一间安全屋。你只管朝着屋子跑，千万别回头。进了门你就安全了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Right beside you," he said grimly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“就在你身边。”他冷冷地说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dylan's eyes were wide with panic. She tried to focus them on the path in front of her. Her hand was wrapped so tightly around Tristan's that her fingers were throbbing. The rumbling seemed to grow louder, and it appeared as if the ground was bubbling, melting to let the demons through. It took a moment for her eyes to make sense of the pattern on the ground, then she realised that it was shadows. Dark shadows. Her breathing began to come in shallow, ragged gasps as she saw that the valley was darkening around them, the cliffs pressing in more tightly. They were deep within the heart of it. How long before the demons broke free?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦睁大了眼睛，眼神中满是惊恐。她尽力死死盯着前方的路，攥着崔斯坦的那只手由于太过用力，手指都在微微颤抖。地下的隆隆声似乎越来越响，整个地面都仿佛在冒泡、融化，好让恶魔们全都钻出来。她费了一会儿工夫才分辨清楚地上的图案，然后就意识到，那就是阴影。她看到周围的山谷正变得越来越黑，悬崖似乎也在不断向他们靠近，不禁呼吸越来越急促，大气也喘不匀了。他们已经走到了阴影深处，还有多久那些恶魔就会破土而出呢？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For a heartbeat she felt as if time had stopped, suspended on the brink of chaos. Every nerve in her body was stretched tight, adrenaline pumped through her veins. Her muscles seemed to tingle, ready to respond to her commands. She took a long, deep breath, and the air rushing into her lungs thundered in her ears.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在那一刻她感觉时间似乎在一片混沌的边缘停止了。她身体里每一根神经都绷紧了，血管中肾上腺素汹涌澎湃。她的肌肉似乎也兴奋起来，随时准备接收她的命令。她深吸一口气，灌进肺里的空气让她的耳朵里呜呜作响。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The air seemed to chill instantly. A gust of wind drove up the valley and lifted Dylan's hair around her face. The breeze whispered in her ears, echoing the noise from the ground, and she picked out the distinct howling of other demons, keening somewhere above them. They were gathering on all sides.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="空气似乎在瞬间就变得冷飕飕的，一阵寒风顺着山谷的岩壁而上，吹得迪伦的头发盖住了脸。耳边是风的低语，和地面上的噪声相应和。她清晰地辨认出了其他恶魔的吼叫声，那哀号声就在他们的头顶。它们正从四面八方围过来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Before she could exhale, before she could blink, time sprang back into being and everything seemed to happen at once. The ground smoked as countless demons erupted through the surface like black, wispy snakes, twisting and writhing in the air and hissing threateningly. The howling from above descended from the sky, diving and weaving around her. Hundreds of them. Thousands. The air was black with wraiths, blinding her. Dylan simply gaped; this was nothing like she'd seen before. Her heart turned to ice as one demon glided straight through her chest, snatching inside her before breaking out of her back. Faceless things caught in her hair and tugged and pulled at her, causing needle-like pains in her scalp. Claws grasped at her shoulders and arms, wrenching and hauling at her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她还没来得及把这口气呼出去，还没来得及眨一下眼睛，时间就一下子跳到现在，所有的事情都在一刹那发生了。无数恶魔像黑色的小蛇般突然冒出来，地上顿时黑烟滚滚。它们在空气中翻滚扭动，气势汹汹地发出嘶嘶声。成百上千，成千上万，铺天盖地，遮蔽了她的视线。迪伦目瞪口呆地傻看着，她之前从未见过这样的情景。一个恶魔从迪伦的胸口钻了进去，在里面抓来抓去，然后又从她后背钻了出来，她的心一下子结成了冰。不知什么东西卡在她的头发里，又扯又拽，头皮上一阵阵刺痛。还有利爪牢牢钳住了她的肩膀和胳膊，使劲拖拽着她。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Run, she repeated to herself. Run! But she couldn't move. Her legs were frozen, as if they had forgotten how to function. She had always laughed scornfully at the victims in horror movies who were paralysed by fright and fell foul of the crazed axe-murdering villain, but here she was, indisputably immobilised by fear.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="跑！她自己也在心里重复了一遍。跑！可是她动不了，腿完全僵硬了，就好像它们已经忘记了该怎么挪动。她以前看的那些恐怖片里有些人遇事会吓得四肢瘫软，结果沦为抡着斧子的杀人狂的牺牲品，她还总是嘲笑人家，可现在轮到自己了，她吓得完全动不了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A yank on her hand made her stumble into motion, jerking her legs into action. They caught up with her before she fell, and began to pump her forward. Run, run, run, she thought, tearing as fast as she could down the path, one hand glued to Tristan's. The screaming demons still swirled around her, but they appeared unable to get a firm grasp.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他猛地拉起迪伦的手，她这才跌跌撞撞地迈开步子。快跑、快跑、快跑，她不断默念着，铆足了力气随他沿路飞奔。恶魔们尖叫着在她周围盘旋，但好在它们暂时没法跟上她的脚步抓住她。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The path laid out the route in front of her, and although she couldn't see the cottage, she knew it couldn't be too far. It had to be close now. She was running at full tilt and knew that she couldn't keep up the pace for long. Her legs were already burning, protesting now at every step. Each time she lifted a foot it felt heavier and heavier. Her breathing came raggedly and unevenly, each intake causing cold, stabbing pains to rip across her chest. Her arms pumped rhythmically, valiantly trying to keep her going, but she was slowing with every stride. The clawing demons were beginning to find purchase, pulling backwards and slowing her further. She knew she would not be able to hold out unless the cottage was very close.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="身边的景物随着她的飞奔快速移动着，虽然还没看见安全屋，但她知道自己已经快要找到它了。可她在全力冲刺的时候就清楚自己没法这样跑太久，她感觉双腿火辣辣的，已经不太听使唤了。呼吸越来越急促，越来越不均匀，每吸一口冷气胸口都撕心裂肺地痛。她的胳膊还在匀称地摆动，奋力地让她继续跑下去，可步子却越来越慢。恶魔们的利爪已经抓住了她，使劲地把她往后拽，她的脚步更慢了。她知道，除非小屋就在眼前，否则自己坚持不下去了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Dylan, run!" Tristan's voice broke through the confusion of sound and movement, straight to the centre of her brain.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Dylan, run!" She heard him holler. He was no longer beside her. Where had he gone? She didn't dare turn round to search for him in case she fell. Instead she concentrated on doing what he'd told her: running. Running as hard and as fast as she could.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“迪伦，快跑！”她听到他在大喊。他不在自己身边。他去哪了呢？她不敢回头看，生怕摔倒。她全力以赴地按他教的去做—跑，尽力跑，越快越好。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Come on, come on, come on, come ON!" she muttered under her breath, ordering her body to keep going. Ignoring the pain, she moved her legs even faster, forcing them to sprint the remaining metres. The door was already open, inviting her in.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“加油，加油，加油，加油！”她小声嘟囔着，命令自己的身体继续前进。这一刻她忘记了疼痛，反而比刚才跑得更快了，她逼着自己以冲刺的速度跑完剩下的几米。门已经敞开了，在等着她进入。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Something pulled on her hand hard enough to almost topple her backwards. Dylan yelped as her shoulder was wrenched in its socket, then, a heartbeat later, realised what had happened. Both her hands were clenched into fists. Empty fists.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有东西使劲拉住了她的手，力道之强，几乎把她向后带倒。迪伦的肩窝一阵剧痛，不由得叫了起来。片刻后，她才醒悟过来是怎么回事。她的双手已经攥成了拳头，赤手空拳。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">What was that? Directly in front of her, about four hundred metres away, was a murky square shape. It had to be the cottage. She sobbed in relief and tried to galvanise her exhausted muscles into one last effort.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那是什么？在她正前方，大约有四百米的距离，朦朦胧胧有一个正方体。那一定是安全屋了。她如释重负地呜咽起来，尽力绷住了自己本已疲惫不堪的肌肉做最后一搏。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Tristan, I can see it! Tristan!" But that final thought choked in her throat as several demons dived at her at once and ripped their way into her body. They seemed to have no substance, yet she could feel them grab at her heart. She stuttered and stumbled, finding it hard to control her limbs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“崔斯坦，我看见小屋了！崔斯坦！”马上就有几个恶鬼朝她俯冲下来，撕开口子钻进她的身体里，最后这几个字就噎在了喉咙里没说出口。这些恶鬼似乎是无影无形的，但她能感到它们在抓她的心脏。她变得步履蹒跚，踉踉跄跄，连自己的腿也很难控制了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sheer will drove her forward, step by step, towards the open door. Every movement was agony, every breath stabbing pain. Her body screamed at her to stop, to give in, but she determinedly and doggedly pushed on. As she inched closer, the screaming, howling and hissing intensified. The demons doubled their attack, pulling and ripping and scratching at her. They swirled around her face and attempted to blind her eyes. Just a few metres away she fell to her knees, exhausted. Screwing her eyes shut tight, she forced her aching lungs to breathe and began to crawl. The ground was cold under her hands, small stones scraping at her palms and digging into her knees. Move, she thought desperately. Just move.</div>
