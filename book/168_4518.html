<div class="line_en">It would not stop, the snow. The drifts were up past his knees, and a crust covered his lower legs like a pair of white greaves. His steps were dragging, lurching. The heavy pack he carried made him look like some monstrous hunchback. And he was tired, so tired. I can't go on. Mother have mercy, I can't.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sobbing, Sam took another step. This is the last one, the very last, I can't go on, I can't. But his feet moved again. One and then the other. They took a step, and then another, and he thought, They're not my feet, they're someone else's, someone else is walking, it can't be me. When he looked down he could see them stumbling through the snow; shapeless things, and clumsy. His boots had been black, he seemed to remember, but the snow had caked around them, and now they were misshapen white balls. Like two clubfeet made of ice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="抽噎着，山姆又迈出一步。这是最后一步，最后最后的一步，我不能再走了，不能再走了。但他的脚却再次移动。一只，另一只；一步，又一步。他心想：这不是我的脚，它们是别人的，别人在走路，不可能是我。他低头就能看到那双笨拙而不成形的东西跌跌撞撞地跨过积雪，依稀记得鞋是黑色，但冰雪在周围冻结，使它们成了奇形怪状的雪球。他的腿好似两根冰棍。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Every fourth or fifth step he had to reach down and tug up his swordbelt. He had lost the sword on the Fist, but the scabbard still weighed down the belt. He did have two knives; the dragonglass dagger Jon had given him and the steel one he cut his meat with. All that weight dragged heavy, and his belly was so big and round that if he forgot to tug the belt slipped right off and tangled round his ankles, no matter how tight he cinched it. He had tried belting it above his belly once, but then it came almost to his armpits. Grenn had laughed himself sick at the sight of it, and Dolorous Edd had said, "I knew a man once who wore his sword on a chain around his neck like that. One day he stumbled, and the hilt went up his nose."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="每走四五步，他都得伸手提剑带。其实早在先民拳峰，剑就丢了，可带子上还挂着两把匕首：琼恩给的龙晶匕首和他用来切肉的钢铁匕首。它们好沉啊，而他的肚子又大又圆，不管腰带系得多紧，如果忘记往上提，它就会滑落，缠到膝盖上。他试过将剑带系在肚子之上，可那样几乎就要达到腋窝，葛兰看了直想笑，而忧郁的艾迪评论说：“从前我认识一个人，他像这样把剑系在脖子上。有一天他滑倒在地，结果被剑柄刺穿了鼻子。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sobbing, Sam took another step. It felt more like he was falling down than walking, falling endlessly but never hitting the ground, just falling forward and forward. I have to stop, it hurts too much. I'm so cold and tired, I need to sleep, just a little sleep beside a fire, and a bite to eat that isn't frozen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="抽噎着，山姆又迈出一步。感觉好像在坠落，而不是走路，永无止境地坠落，却又碰不到地面，只是一直往下，往下。我必须停止，好痛苦啊。我又冷又累，想睡…哪怕在火堆边睡一小会儿，吃点没有结冻的食物。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sam was stumbling himself. There were rocks beneath the snow, and the roots of trees, and sometimes deep holes in the frozen ground. Black Bernarr had stepped in one and broken his ankle three days past, or maybe four, or… he did not know how long it had been, truly. The Lord Commander had put Bernarr on a horse after that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山姆一天到晚都在滑倒摔跤，因此他害怕。积雪下不仅有岩石树根，有时候冻土还掩盖了深深的窟窿。黑伯纳就踏入过一个窟窿，扭断了脚踝，那是三天前，还是四天前，还是…他其实不知道过了多久，反正在那之后，总司令就让伯纳骑马。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But if he stopped he died. He knew that. They all knew that, the few who were left. They had been fifty when they fled the Fist, maybe more, but some had wandered off in the snow, a few wounded had bled to death… and sometimes Sam heard shouts behind him, from the rear guard, and once an awful scream. When he heard that he had run, twenty yards or thirty, as fast and as far as he could, his half-frozen feet kicking up the snow, He would be running still if his legs were stronger. They are behind us, they are still behind us, they are taking us one by one.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但他清楚，如果停下来，就死定了。为数不多的幸存者们对此都清楚。逃离先民拳峰时，他们有五十个，也许更多，但接下来有人在大雪中走失，还有伤员流血至死…有时山姆听到殿后的人发出喊声，甚至是凄厉的惨叫。他一听之下便开始狂奔，奔出二三十码，尽其所能地跑，冻成冰棍的双脚死命踢起积雪。若腿再强壮一点，他还会继续。它们在我们后面，它们还在我们后面，它们要把我们一个个放倒。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sobbing, Sam took another step. He had been cold so long he was forgetting what it was like to feel warm. He wore three pairs of hose, two layers of smallclothes beneath a double lambswool tunic, and over that a thick quilted coat that padded him against the cold steel of his chainmail. Over the hauberk he had a loose surcoat, over that a triplethick cloak with a bone button that fastened tight under his chins. Its hood flopped forward over his forehead. Heavy fur mitts covered his hands over thin wool-and-leather gloves, a scarf was wrapped snugly about the lower half of his face, and he had a tight-fitting fleece-lined cap to pull down over his ears beneath the hood. And still the cold was in him. His feet especially. He couldn't even feel them now, but only yesterday they had hurt so bad he could hardly bear to stand on them, let alone walk. Every step made him want to scream. Was that yesterday? He could not remember. He had not slept since the Fist, not once since the horn had blown. Unless it was while he was walking. Could a man walk while he was sleeping? Sam did not know, or else he had forgotten.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="抽噎着，山姆又迈出一步。长久的天寒地冻，让他忘了温暖的感觉。他共穿了三双长袜，两件内衣，外套双层羔羊毛上装，在此之外是一件厚实的棉褂，然后才是冰冷的铁锁甲，锁甲外他穿一件宽松的外套和加厚两倍的斗篷，斗篷用骨扣在下巴下扣紧，兜帽前翻，盖住额头。他戴了轻便的羊毛皮革手套，外罩厚厚的毛皮拳套，一条头巾紧紧包裹着脸庞，兜帽里面还有一顶绷紧的绒线帽，盖住耳朵。虽然如此，他仍觉得冷。尤其是脚，甚至感觉不到它们的存在——而就在昨天，它们却又痛得厉害，教人站着都无法忍受，逞论走路？每一步都让他想要尖叫。那是昨天吗？他不清楚。自离开先民拳峰以来，他就没睡过觉，应该说从号角吹响之后就没有躺下。除非是在走路时…人可以边走边睡吗？山姆不清楚，或者是又忘记了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">If only I was stronger… He wasn't, though, and it was no good wishing. Sam was weak, and fat, so very fat, he could hardly bear his own weight, the mail was much too much for him. It felt as though it was rubbing his shoulders raw, despite the layers of cloth and quilt between the steel and skin. The only thing he could do was cry, and when he cried the tears froze on his cheeks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果我再强壮一些，就好了…可我并不强壮，想也没有用。山姆又虚弱又肥胖，胖得承受不住自己的重量，锁甲对他而言委实太沉，尽管钢铁与肌肤之间有层层麻布与棉花，感觉上却好像把肩膀都磨破了。他唯一能做的只有抽噎，哭的时候，眼泪冻结在脸颊上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sobbing, he took another step. The snow swirled down around him. Sometimes it fell from a white sky, and sometimes from a black, but that was all that remained of day and night. He wore it on his shoulders like a second cloak, and it piled up high atop the pack he carried and made it even heavier and harder to bear. The small of his back hurt abominably, as if someone had shoved a knife in there and was wiggling it back and forth with every step. His shoulders were in agony from the weight of the mail. He would have given most anything to take it off, but he was afraid to. Anyway he would have needed to remove his cloak and surcoat to get at it, and then the cold would have him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="抽噎着，山姆又迈出一步。雪盘旋着在周围降下。有时候，它从白色的天空落下，有时候则从黑色的天空坠落，这是白天与黑夜惟一的区别。他肩上披满雪花，就像另一件斗篷，雪在包裹上高高地堆积，使得包裹更加沉重，更加难以承受。他的背心疼痛难忍，仿佛被插进了一把匕首，每走一步都来回绞动。他的肩膀因锁甲的重量而麻木。他一心想把它脱掉，却又不敢脱。因为要脱它，就得先脱大衣和外套，那样会被冻坏的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sobbing, he took another step. The crust was broken where he set his feet, otherwise he did not think he could have moved at all. Off to the left and right, half-seen through the silent trees, torches turned to vague orange haloes in the falling snow. When he turned his head he could see them, slipping silent through the wood, bobbing up and down and back and forth. The Old Bear's ring of fire, he reminded himself, and woe to him who leaves it. As he walked, it seemed as if he were chasing the torches ahead of him, but they had legs as well, longer and stronger than his, so he could never catch them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="抽噎着，山姆又迈出一步。若不是冰壳在脚下碎裂，他根本不觉得自己在走。左右两边，寂静的树木之间，隐约可以见到火炬，在坠落的雪花当中，发出橙色的光晕。它们静静地在树丛中移动，忽上忽下、忽前忽后地晃。那是熊老的火炬圈，他提醒自己，并为离开了它的人悲哀。他觉得自己是在追赶前方那些火炬，可惜它们也长了脚，而且比他的长，比他的壮，所以一直追不上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Yesterday he begged for them to let him be one of the torchbearers, even if it meant walking outside of the column with the darkness pressing close. He wanted the fire, dreamed of the fire. If I had the fire, I would not be cold. But someone reminded him that he'd had a torch at the start, but he'd dropped it in the snow and snuffed the fire out. Sam didn't remember dropping any torch, but he supposed it was true. He was too weak to hold his arm up for long. Was it Edd who reminded him about the torch, or Grenn? He couldn't remember that either. Fat and weak and useless, even my wits are freezing now He took another step.</div>

<div class="line_en">His own mother was a thousand leagues south, safe with his sisters and his little brother Dickon in the keep at Horn Hill. She can't hear me, no more than the Mother Above. The Mother was merciful, all the septons agreed, but the Seven had no power beyond the Wall. This was where the old gods ruled, the nameless gods of the trees and the wolves and the snows. "Mercy," he whispered then, to whatever might be listening, old gods or new, or demons too, "oh, mercy, mercy me, mercy me."</div>

<div class="line_en">He had wrapped his scarf over his nose and mouth, but it was covered with snot now, and so stiff he feared it must be frozen to his face. Even breathing was hard, and the air was so cold it hurt to swallow it. "Mother have mercy," he muttered in a hushed husky voice beneath the frozen mask. "Mother have mercy, Mother have mercy, Mother have mercy." With each prayer he took another step, dragging his legs through the snow. "Mother have mercy, Mother have mercy, Mother have mercy."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他用头巾裹住鼻子和嘴巴，巾上全是鼻涕，僵硬的鼻涕，他担心它和脸冻在了一起。呼吸也困难，空气如此冰冷，吸进去都感到疼痛。“圣母慈悲，”他用沙哑的声音在冰冻的面罩下轻轻咕哝，“圣母慈悲，圣母慈悲，圣母慈悲，”每祈祷一句，就拖着腿在雪地里又跨一步，“圣母慈悲，圣母慈悲，圣母慈悲。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Maslyn screamed for mercy. Why had he suddenly remembered that? It was nothing he wanted to remember. The man had stumbled backward, dropping his sword, pleading, yielding, even yanking off his thick black glove and thrusting it up before him as if it were a gauntlet. He was still shrieking for quarter as the wight lifted him in the air by the throat and near ripped the head off him. The dead have no mercy left in them, and the Others… no, I mustn't think of that, don't think, don't remember, just walk, just walk, just walk.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="马斯林尖叫着求它可怜他。为何突然联想起这个？我不该记住这个。他跌跌撞撞地往后退去，扔掉长剑，跪倒，恳求，甚至脱下厚厚的黑手套举在面前，当那是骑士表示降伏的护手甲。但尸鬼捏住他的喉咙，把他举到半空，几乎将脑袋拧下来。他还在尖声呼喊，祈求怜悯。死人没有怜悯，而异鬼…不，我不该想这些，不能想这些，不要去回忆，只管走路，走路，走路。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A root beneath the crust caught his toe, and Sam tripped and fell heavily to one knee, so hard he bit his tongue. He could taste the blood in his mouth, warmer than anything he had tasted since the Fist. This is the end, he thought. Now that he had fallen he could not seem to find the strength to rise again. He groped for a tree branch and clutched it tight, trying to pull himself back to his feet, but his stiff legs would not support him. The mail was too heavy, and he was too fat besides, and too weak, and too tired.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="冰壳下的树根猛然绊住脚趾，山姆一个踉跄，沉重地单膝跪倒，咬到了自己的舌头。他尝到血的滋味，那比自先民拳峰以来尝过的任何东西都温暖。这就是我的终点，他心想，既然跌倒，就再没力气爬起来。他摸到一根树枝，牢牢握住，试图把自己重新拉起，但那双僵硬的腿实在无力支撑。锁甲太沉，而他太肥胖，太虚弱，太疲倦。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Back on your feet, Piggy," someone growled as he went past, but Sam paid him no mind. I'll just lie down in the snow and close my eyes. It wouldn't be so bad, dying here. He couldn't possibly be any colder, and after a little while he wouldn't be able to feel the ache in his lower back or the terrible pain in his shoulders, no more than he could feel his feet. I won't be the first to die, they can't say I was. Hundreds had died on the Fist, they had died all around him, and more had died after, he'd seen them. Shivering, Sam released his grip on the tree and eased himself down in the snow. It was cold and wet, he knew, but he could scarcely feel it through all his clothing. He stared upward at the pale white sky as snowflakes drifted down upon his stomach and his chest and his eyelids. The snow will cover me like a thick white blanket. It will be warm under the snow, and if they speak of me they'll have to say I died a man of the Night's Watch. I did. I did. I did my duty. No one can say I forswore myself. I'm fat and I'm weak and I'm craven, but I did my duty.</div>

<div class="line_en">The ravens had been his responsibility. That was why they had brought him along. He hadn't wanted to go, he'd told them so, he'd told them all what a big coward he was. But Maester Aemon was very old and blind besides, so they had to send Sam to tend to the ravens. The Lord Commander had given him his orders when they made their camp on the Fist. "You're no fighter. We both know that, boy. If it happens that we're attacked, don't go trying to prove otherwise, you'll just get in the way. You're to send a message. And don't come running to ask what the letter should say. Write it out yourself, and send one bird to Castle Black and another to the Shadow Tower." The Old Bear pointed a gloved finger right in Sam's face. "I don't care if you're so scared you foul your breeches, and I don't care if a thousand wildlings are coming over the walls howling for your blood, you get those birds off, or I swear I'll hunt you through all seven hells and make you damn sorry that you didn't."

He was sorry to die too, but better men had died on the Fist, good men and true, not squeaking fat boys like him. At least he would not have the Old Bear hunting him through hell, though. I got the birds off. I did that right, at least. He had written out the messages ahead of time, short messages and simple, telling of an attack on the Fist of the First Men, and then he had tucked them away safe in his parchment pouch, hoping he would never need to send them.</div>

He thought he was dreaming them at first, but when he opened his eyes snow was falling on the camp and the black brothers were all grabbing bows and spears and running toward the ringwall. Chett was the only one nearby, Maester Aemon's old steward with the face full of boils and the big wen on his neck. Sam had never seen so much fear on a man's face as he saw on Chett's when that third blast came moaning through the trees. "Help me get the birds off," he pleaded, but the other steward had turned and run off, dagger in hand. He has the dogs to care for, Sam remembered. Probably the Lord Commander had given him some orders as well.</div>

<div class="line_en">His duty done, he finished dressing with clumsy, frightened fingers, donning his cap and surcoat and hooded cloak and buckling on his swordbelt, buckling it real tight so it wouldn't fall down. Then he found his pack and stuffed all his things inside, spare smallclothes and dry socks, the dragonglass arrowheads and spearhead Jon had given him and the old horn too, his parchments, inks, and quills, the maps he'd been drawing, and a rock-hard garlic sausage he'd been saving since the Wall. He tied it all up and shouldered the pack onto his back. The Lord Commander said I wasn't to rush to the ringwall, he recalled, but he said I shouldn't come running to him either.

<div class="line_en">His fingers had been so stiff and clumsy in the gloves, and he was shaking from fear and cold, but he found the parchment pouch and dug out the messages he'd written. The ravens were shrieking furiously, and when he opened the Castle Black cage one of them flew right in his face. Two more escaped before Sam could catch one, and when he did it pecked him through his glove, drawing blood. Yet somehow he held on long enough to attach the little roll of parchment.

Sam stood well back behind the others, looking for Grenn or Dolorous Edd. If I have to die, let me die beside my friends, he remembered thinking. But all the men around him were strangers, Shadow Tower men under the command of the ranger named Blane.</div>

A dog ran past barking, and he saw some of the men from the Shadow Tower, big bearded men with longaxes and eight-foot spears. He felt safer for their company, so he followed them to the wall.

There were dogs barking and horses trumpeting, but the snow muffled the sounds and made them seem far away. Sam could see nothing beyond three yards, not even the torches burning along the low stone wall that ringed the crown of the hill. Could the torches have gone out? That was too scary to think about. The horn blew thrice long, three long blasts means Others. The white walkers of the wood, the cold shadows, the monsters of the tales that made him squeak and tremble as a boy, riding their giant ice-spiders, hungry for blood…</div>

<div class="line_en">He was such a coward. Lord Randyll, his father, had always said so, and he had been right. Sam was his heir, but he had never been worthy, so his father had sent him away to the Wall. His little brother Dickon would inherit the Tarly lands and castle, and the greatsword Heartsbane that the lords of Horn Hill had borne so proudly for centuries. He wondered whether Dickon would shed a tear for his brother who died in the snow, somewhere off beyond the edge of the world. Why should he? A coward's not worth weeping over. He had heard his father tell his mother as much, half a hundred times. The Old Bear knew it too.</div>

<div class="line_en">A horse stepped past his head, a shaggy grey beast with snow in its mane and hooves crusted with ice. Sam watched it come and watched it go. Another appeared from out of the falling snow, with a man in black leading it. When he saw Sam in his path he cursed him and led the horse around. I wish I had a horse, he thought. If I had a horse I could keep going. I could sit, and even sleep some in the saddle. Most of their mounts had been lost at the Fist, though, and those that remained carried their food, their torches, and their wounded. Sam wasn't wounded. Only fat and weak, and the greatest craven in the Seven Kingdoms.</div>

"Spears," someone said. It might have been Ser Mallador, but Sam could not swear to it. Wights attacked us on the Fist, in snow, he wrote, but we drove them off with fire. He turned his head. Through the drifting snow, all he could see was the huge fire at the center of the camp, with mounted men moving restlessly around it.

"Loose, loose, loose," a voice screamed in the night, and another shouted, "Bloody huge," and a third voice said, "A giant!" and a fourth insisted, "A bear, a bear!" A horse shrieked and the hounds began to bay, and there was so much shouting that Sam couldn't make out the voices anymore. He wrote faster, note after note. Dead wildlings, and a giant, or maybe a bear, on us, all around. He heard the crash of steel on wood, which could only mean one thing. Wights over the ringwall. Fighting inside the camp. A dozen mounted brothers pounded past him toward the east wall, burning brands streaming flames in each rider's hand. Lord Commander Mormont is meeting them with fire. We've won. We're winning.

<div class="line_en">"They're gone," said Sam. "I'm sorry." So sorry. "They're flying back to the Wall now." He had set the birds free when he'd heard the warhorns sound once more, calling the Watch to horse. Two short blasts and a long one, that was the call to mount up. But there was no reason to mount, unless to abandon the Fist, and that meant the battle was lost. The fear bit him so strong then that it was all Sam could do to open the cages.

<div class="line_en">After that… he remembered the dead coming over the stones with arrows in their faces and through their throats. Some were all in ringmail and some were almost naked… wildlings, most of them, but a few wore faded blacks. He remembered one of the Shadow Tower men shoving his spear through a wight's pale soft belly and out his back, and how the thing staggered right up the shaft and reached out his black hands and twisted the brother's head around until blood came out his mouth.

<div class="line_en">He did not remember running, but he must have, because the next he knew he was near the fire half a camp away, with old Ser Ottyn Wythers and some archers. Ser Ottyn was on his knees in the snow, staring at the chaos around them, until a riderless horse came by and kicked him in the face. The archers paid him no mind. They were loosing fire arrows at shadows in the dark.

<div class="line_en">They were at the gallop by the time they reached the ring. Sam had always been too frightened to jump a horse before, but when the low stone wall loomed up before him he knew he had no choice. He kicked and closed his eyes and whimpered, and the garron took him over, somehow, somehow, the garron took him over. The rider to his right came crashing down in a tangle of steel and leather and screaming horseflesh, and then the wights were swarming over him and the wedge was closing up. They plunged down the hillside at a run, through clutching black hands and burning blue eyes and blowing snow. Horses stumbled and rolled, men were swept from their saddles, torches spun through the air, axes and swords hacked at dead flesh, and Samwell Tarly sobbed, clutching desperately to his horse with a strength he never knew he had.</div>

<div class="line_en">That was his last coherent memory of the Fist of the First Men. Later, hours later, he stood shivering among the other survivors, half mounted and half afoot. They were miles from the Fist by then, though Sam did not remember how. Dywen had led down five packhorses, heavy laden with food and oil and torches, and three had made it this far. The Old Bear made them redistribute the loads, so the loss of any one horse and its provisions would not be such a catastrophe. He took garrons from the healthy men and gave them to the wounded, organized the walkers, and set torches to guard their flanks and rear. All I need do is walk, Sam told himself, as he took that first step toward home. But before an hour was gone he had begun to struggle, and to lag…</div>

<div class="line_en">The lower branches of the great green sentinel shed their burden of snow with a soft wet plop. Grenn spun, thrusting out his torch. "Who goes there?" A horse's head emerged from the darkness. Sam felt a moment's relief, until he saw the horse. Hoarfrost covered it like a sheen of frozen sweat, and a nest of stiff black entrails dragged from its open belly. On its back was a rider pale as ice. Sam made a whimpery sound deep in his throat. He was so scared he might have pissed himself all over again, but the cold was in him, a cold so savage that his bladder felt frozen solid. The Other slid gracefully from the saddle to stand upon the snow. Sword-slim it was, and milky white. Its armor rippled and shifted as it moved, and its feet did not break the crust of the new-fallen snow.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="停，停下别哭，停下来战斗，你这没用的小子。战斗啊，胆小鬼！这是父亲的声音？艾里沙·索恩的声音？弟弟狄肯的声音？还是那个叫雷斯特的男孩？胆小鬼，胆小鬼，胆小鬼！他歇斯底里地笑起来，不知它们会不会把他也变成尸鬼，一个又白又胖又大的尸鬼，一个老是被已死的双脚绊倒的尸鬼。停，停下别哭，停下来战斗。这是琼恩的声音？不可能，琼恩已经死了。你能行，你能行，快啊。于是他跌跌撞撞地往前撞去，与其说在跑，不如说是跌倒前的踉跄，他闭起眼睛，双手握住那把匕首，盲目地乱戳。只听喀嚓一声，好像冰在脚下碎裂的响动，随后是一声尖啸，如此犀利，以至于他扔了匕首，双手捂住耳朵，盲目向后退去，一屁股沉重地坐到地上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The wights had been slow clumsy things, but the Other was light as snow on the wind. it slid away from Paul's axe, armor rippling, and its crystal sword twisted and spun and slipped between the iron rings of Paul's mail, through leather and wool and bone and flesh. It came out his back with a hissssssssssss and Sam heard Paul say, "Oh," as he lost the axe. Impaled, his blood smoking around the sword, the big man tried to reach his killer with his hands and almost had before he fell. The weight of him tore the strange pale sword from the Other's grip.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尸鬼的行动笨拙而缓慢，但异鬼如风中的雪花一样轻盈。它闪过保罗的长柄斧，盔甲的图案如波光般涟漪，而水晶的剑回扣、翻转，滑进保罗锁甲的铁环间，穿过皮革、羊毛、骨头与血肉，从他后背“嘶嘶嘶嘶嘶嘶嘶嘶嘶嘶嘶嘶嘶嘶”地穿出。只听保罗叫了声“噢”，斧子便从手里松脱。他被钉在水晶剑上，热血在周围蒸汽朦朦，大个子抓向对手，可在几乎快要碰到时，倒了下去，他的体重将那柄诡异的白剑从异鬼手中拉扯下来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When he opened his eyes the Other's armor was running down its legs in rivulets as pale blue blood hissed and steamed around the black dragonglass dagger in its throat. It reached down with two bone-white hands to pull out the knife, but where its fingers touched the obsidian they smoked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当他睁开眼睛，异鬼的盔甲正像露水一样融化，黑色的龙晶匕首插在它咽喉，淡蓝的血从伤口喷出，在匕首周围嘶嘶冒气。它伸出两只骸骨般苍白的手去拔匕首，但指头一触到黑曜石便开始冒烟消解。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sam rolled onto his side, eyes wide as the Other shrank and puddled, dissolving away. In twenty heartbeats its flesh was gone, swirling away in a fine white mist. Beneath were bones like milkglass, pale and shiny, and they were melting too. Finally only the dragonglass dagger remained, wreathed in steam as if it were alive and sweating. Grenn bent to scoop it up and flung it down again at once. "Mother, that's cold."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山姆侧身坐起，瞪大了眼睛，异鬼的身躯正逐渐缩小，混沌模糊，化为一滩液体，最后彻底消失。几十个心跳间，形体已然不存，只余细细一缕盘旋散发的烟雾。下面是乳白玻璃般的骨头，闪着苍白的光，接着也融化了。最后，只有龙晶匕首存留，水汽缭绕中，它仿佛有了生命，好像在出汗。葛兰弯腰去拣，却又立即将它甩开，“圣母啊，它好冷！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Obsidian." Sam struggled to his knees. "Dragonglass, they call it. Dragonglass. Dragon glass." He giggled, and cried, and doubled over to heave his courage out onto the snow.</div>
