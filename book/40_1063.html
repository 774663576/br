After curfew, everyone locked their doors, turned out the lights, turned down the volume, and reaped tears for Jack and Rose and the passengers of the doomed ship.

The customer complained that Rasheed had rudely tossed the bread on his table. Harsh words had passed. Rasheed had called the customer a monkey-faced Uzbek. A gun had been brandished.

<div class="line_en">Rice, boiled plain and white, with no meat or sauce, was a rare treat now. They skipped meals with increasing and alarming regularity. Sometimes Rasheed brought home sardines in a can and brittle, dried bread that tasted like sawdust. Sometimes a stolen bag of apples, at the risk of getting his hand sawed off. In grocery stores, he carefully pocketed canned ravioli, which they split five ways, Zalmai getting the lion's share. They ate raw turnips sprinkled with salt. Limp leaves of lettuce and blackened bananas for dinner.</div>

<div class="line_en">Death from starvation suddenly became a distinct possibility. Some chose not to wait for it. Mariam heard of a neighborhood widow who had ground some dried bread, laced it with rat poison, and fed it to all seven of her children. She had saved the biggest portion for herself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然之间，饿死变成了迫在眉睫的事情。有些人选择了在饿死之前自尽。玛丽雅姆听说邻居有个寡妇捏碎了一些干面包，拌上老鼠药，给七个孩子全都喂了毒面包。她给自己留下了最大的一份。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Aziza's ribs began to push through the skin, and the fat from her cheeks vanished. Her calves thinned, and her complexion turned the color of weak tea. When Mariam picked her up, she could feel her hip bone poking through the taut skin. Zalmai lay around the house, eyes dulled and half closed, or in his father's lap limp as a rag. He cried himself to sleep, when he could muster the energy, but his sleep was fitful and sporadic. White dots leaped before Mariam's eyes whenever she got up. Her head spun, and her ears rang all the time. She remembered something Mullah Faizullah used to say about hunger when Ramadan started: Even the snakebitten man finds sleep, but not the hungry.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿兹莎的肋骨开始从皮肤之下显露出来，脸颊上的肉也消失了。她的小腿变细了，皮肤变成淡茶色。当抱起她的时候，玛丽雅姆觉得她的屁股骨头好像要刺穿皮肤似的。察尔迈伊在房间里到处乱躺，无神的眼睛半开半闭；或者像一块破布那样趴在他父亲的膝盖上。他哭喊着说他要睡觉——当他有这个精力的时候——但是他睡得很浅，经常睡着、睡着就醒过来。玛丽雅姆无论在什么时候起床，总是有一些白点在眼前冒出来。她头昏脑涨，耳朵一直鸣个不停。她想起了当年每逢斋月开始的时候，法苏拉赫毛拉总是跟她提起的一句话：人们就算被毒蛇咬到也能入睡，但是饥饿的时候会睡不着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When the doorman went inside, Mariam and Rasheed waited. From this vantage point, Mariam had a view of the Polytechnic Institute, and, beyond that, the old Khair khana district and the road to Mazar. To the south, she could see the bread factory, Silo, long abandoned, its pale yellow façade pocked with yawning holes from all the shelling it had endured. Farther south, she could make out the hollow ruins of Darulaman Palace, where, many years back, Rasheed had taken her for a picnic. The memory of that day was a relic from a past that no longer seemed like her own.</div>

<div class="line_en">As Mariam listened to the scratchy ringing, her mind wandered. It wandered to the last time she'd seen Jalil, thirteen years earlier, back in the spring of 1987. He'd stood on the street outside her house, leaning on a cane, beside the blue Benz with the Herat license plates and the white stripe bisecting the roof, the hood, and trunk. He'd stood there for hours, waiting for her, now and then calling her name, just as she had once called his name outside his house. Mariam had parted the curtain once, just a bit, and caught a glimpse of him. Only a glimpse, but long enough to see that his hair had turned fluffy white, and that he'd started to stoop. He wore glasses, a red tie, as always, and the usual white handkerchief triangle in his breast pocket. Most striking, he was thinner, much thinner, than she remembered, the coat of his dark brown suit drooping over his shoulders, the trousers pooling at his ankles.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛丽雅姆听着咔嚓、咔嚓的铃声，思绪翻飞。她想到了最后一次见到扎里勒的情景，十三年前的事情了，当时是1987年的春天。他站在她房子外面的街道上，拄着拐杖，身边是一辆赫拉特牌照的蓝色奔驰，一道白线从中间将车盖、车顶和车厢分成两半。他在那儿站了好几个小时，等着她，不时呼唤她的名字，就像她曾经在他的屋子外面呼唤他的名字一样。玛丽雅姆曾有一次把窗帘分开，只分开了一点点，朝他看了一眼。只是一眼，但足够看清他的头发变得蓬松而灰白，看清他已经有点驼背。他戴着眼镜，系着红领带，胸前的口袋依旧插着一条折成三角形的白色手帕。最令玛丽雅姆吃惊的是，比起她记忆中的他，扎里勒消瘦了，瘦了很多，暗棕色的西装上衣松松垮垮地搭在他的肩膀上，裤管在他脚踝堆积起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

What would have been the harm to let him in, sit with him, let him say what he'd come to say? He was her father.
