<div class="line_en">She knew, of course, that Ove didn't know how to bear his nameless anger. He needed labels to put on it. Ways of categorizing. So when men in white shirts at the council, whose names no normal person could keep track of, tried to do everything Sonja did not want -- make her stop working, move her out of her house, imply that she was worth less than a healthy person who was able to walk, and assert that she was dying -- Ove fought them. With documents and letters to newspapers and appeals, right down to something as unremarkable as an access ramp at a school. He fought so doggedly for her against men in white shirts that in the end he began to hold them personally responsible for all that happened to her -- and to the child.</div>

<div class="line_en">"All people want to live dignified lives; dignity just means something different to different people," Sonja had said. To men like Ove and Rune dignity was simply that they'd had to manage on their own when they grew up, and therefore saw it as their right not to become reliant on others when they were adults. There was a sense of pride in having control. In being right. In knowing what road to take and how to screw in a screw, or not. Men like Ove and Rune were from a generation in which one was what one did, not what one talked about.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“每个人都想有尊严地生活。对不同的人来说，尊严是不同的。”索雅曾说。对欧维和鲁尼这样的男人来说，尊严只是成年以后可以自力更生，把不需要依靠别人视为自己的权利。掌控中存在一种自豪感，明辨是非的自豪感，知道该走哪条路，知道该不该在哪儿拧上螺丝。欧维和鲁尼这样的人还留在靠行动而不是靠嘴说的年代，索雅总是那么说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sonja said once that to understand men like Ove and Rune, one had to understand from the very beginning that they were men caught in the wrong time. Men who only required a few simple things from life, she said. A roof over their heads, a quiet street, the right make of car, and a woman to be faithful to. A job where you had a proper function. A house where things broke at regular intervals, so you always had something to tinker with.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="索雅曾经说过，要理解欧维和鲁尼这样的男人，首先要理解他们是被困在错误时代中的男人。他们这样的男人，对于生活只要求几样非常简单的事情，她说。头上一片屋顶，安静的街道，值得他们忠心耿耿的汽车品牌和女人。一份可以有所作为的工作，一套房子，里面的东西定期有个故障，好让他们修修补补。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When the cat finally rolls onto its back on Sonja's pillow and starts snoring with an open mouth, Ove sneaks out of bed as light-footedly as he can. Goes down into the living room, gets out the rifle from the hiding place behind the radiator. He gets out four heavy-duty tarpaulins he's fetched in from the toolshed and hidden in the broom cupboard so the cat doesn't notice them. Starts taping them up on the walls in the hall. Ove, after some consideration, has decided that this will probably be the best room for the deed, because it has the smallest surface area. He's assuming that there's a good deal of splattering when one shoots oneself in the head, and he's loath to leave more of a mess behind than he has to. Sonja always hated it when he made a mess.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当猫咪终于翻了个身，在索雅的枕头上张着嘴打起呼噜，欧维尽可能蹑手蹑脚地翻身下床。他下楼回到客厅，从暖气后端出藏好的猎枪。他还从杂物柜里拿出四片塑料防护膜来，这是他早先从储藏室里找来的，为了不让猫咪发现，他藏了起来。他把它们贴到了门厅的墙上。经过一番斟酌，欧维决定这里是办事的最佳场所，因为这儿表面积最小。欧维猜，往自己脑门上来一枪会溅得挺厉害，没必要弄得太乱。索雅最讨厌他把家弄乱了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Later that night, once Ove and the cat have had their dinner and watched the TV for a while, he turns out the lamp in the living room and goes upstairs. The cat follows watchfully at his heels, as if sensing that he's going to do something it hasn't been informed about. It sits on the bedroom floor while Ove gets undressed and looks as if it's trying to figure out a magic trick.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="猫咪回来的时候，欧维依然坐在门厅里。它挠门，欧维把门打开。他们互相看了一眼，欧维退到一边，把它让进屋。之后，他们吃晚饭看电视。十点半，欧维关掉客厅里的灯，上楼。猫咪警觉地跟着他的脚后跟，就好像知道他瞒着什么。一定是什么它不喜欢的事。它坐在卧室的地板上，看着欧维脱衣服，像要拆穿什么魔术。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ove goes to bed and lies still while the bloody cat, on Sonja's side of the bed, takes more than an hour to go to sleep. Obviously, he does not go to such lengths because of some lingering sense of obligation to the cat; he just doesn't have the energy for an argument. He can't be expected to explain the concept of life and death to an animal that can't even take care of its own fur.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维躺在床上，静静地等它终于在索雅的那一边睡着。等了足有一个小时。欧维这么做，当然不是因为他有什么义务照顾这只猫崽子的感受，但他懒得惹麻烦。他认为一个人完全没必要跟个连自己尾巴都保不齐的畜生解释生死大事，仅此而已。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He's wearing his going-out shoes and suit again. It's dirty and still smells of car exhaust, but it'll have to do. He weighs the rifle in his hands, as if checking its center of gravity. As if this will play a decisive role in the future of the venture. He turns and twists it, tries to angle the barrel almost as if intending to fold the weapon double. Not that Ove knows very much about weapons, but one wants to know if it's a decent piece of equipment one's got, more or less. And because Ove supposes one can't test the quality of a rifle by kicking it, he decides it can be done by bending and pulling at it, to see what happens.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他又穿上了外出用的皮鞋和西服。这身衣服已经很脏，仍旧一股汽车尾气的味道，但也将就了。他用双手掂了掂猎枪的分量，就像要找到平衡点似的，就像这对未来局势起着至关重要的作用。他把它端在手中翻来转去，还掰了掰枪管，就像要把它一掰两半似的。也不是因为欧维现在对武器有多少了解，但办事的工具怎么说总得趁手。欧维估摸着踹两脚好像不太合适，于是他决定用手来掰一掰，拽一拽。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">While he's doing this, it strikes him that it was probably a fairly bad idea to put on his best gear. Will be an awful lot of blood on the suit, Ove imagines. Seems silly. So he puts down the rifle, goes into the living room, gets undressed, carefully folds up the suit, and puts it neatly beside his going-out shoes. Then he gets out the letter with all the instructions for Parvaneh and writes "Bury me in my suit" under the heading "Funeral Arrangements" and puts the letter on top of the pile of clothes. He has already stated clearly and unmistakably that there should not be any fuss in other respects. No exaggerated ceremony and rubbish like that. Shove him in the ground next to Sonja, that's all. The spot has already been prepared and paid for, and Ove has put cash in the envelope for the hearse.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然之间，他意识到自己穿这么正式非常不妥。肯定会溅一身血，欧维想。有点犯傻。于是他放下猎枪，走进客厅，脱下衣服，把西服仔细叠好，整齐地放在皮鞋旁边的地板上。然后他把委托帕尔瓦娜善后的信拿出来，在“葬礼”一栏下加了“穿西服下葬”后，放在了那叠衣服上。信里本来就已经写得清清楚楚——不需要冗余的装饰；不需要什么乱七八糟的仪式。只要在索雅身边入土为安就好。墓地早已结算清楚，欧维还在信封里留了运送遗体的费用。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It's very quiet in the house. In the whole neighborhood, actually. Everyone's sleeping. And only then does Ove realize that the cat will probably wake at the sound of the shot. Will probably scare the living daylights out of the poor critter, Ove admits. He thinks about this for a good while before he determinedly sets down the rifle and goes into the kitchen to turn on the radio. Not that he needs music to take his own life, and not that he likes the idea of the radio clicking its way through units of electricity when he's gone. But because if the cat wakes up from the bang, it may end up thinking that it's just a part of one of those modern pop songs the radio plays all the time these days. And then go back to sleep. That is Ove's train of thought.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="屋子里寂静异常。其实整个小区里都这样。大家都在睡觉。这时，欧维才第一次意识到，枪响会把猫咪惊醒。一定会把猫崽子给吓坏的，欧维想。他思量了好一会儿，才决定放下猎枪，去厨房打开收音机。并不是因为他现在需要音乐陪伴才能结束自己的生命，也不是他喜欢死后收音机继续耗电这念头，而是，如果猫被响声惊醒，大概会以为这只不过是收音机在播放时下流行的时髦音乐，然后就接着睡去了。欧维是这么想的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So, wearing nothing but his socks and underwear, Ove goes back into the hall and picks up his rifle. He catches sight of his own body in the hall mirror. He hasn't seen himself in this way for probably thirty-five years. He's still quite muscular and robust. Certainly in better shape than most men of his age. But something's happened to his skin that makes him look like he's melting, he notes. It looks terrible.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是，只穿着袜子和内裤的欧维回到门厅里再次举枪。他在墙上的镜子里看见自己的身体，大概有三十五年没这么端详自己了。他仍然算得上肌肉发达体格健壮，一定比大多数同龄人结实。但他留意到自己的皮肤起了些变化，使他看上去好似要溶解，不太正常。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">From a purely objective point of view, the fact that Ove was wielding a gun was something two other hooligans, Adrian and Mirsad, would ideally have been aware of before they unconcernedly trotted up to Ove's front door a few seconds later. They would then quite likely have understood that when Ove heard their creaking steps in the snow he would not immediately think to himself, Guests, how nice! but rather, Well, I'll be damned! And they'd probably also know that Ove, wearing nothing but socks and underpants, with a three-quarter-century-old hunting rifle in his hands, would kick the door open like an aging, half-naked, suburban Rambo. And maybe then Adrian would not have screamed in a high-pitched voice that went right through every window on the street, nor would he have turned in panic and run into the toolshed, almost knocking himself unconscious.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从纯客观的角度看，应该有人把这条消息在另外两个流氓——阿德里安和米尔莎德于两秒钟之后大大咧咧地出现在欧维家门口之前告诉他们。这样，他们就会知道，欧维听见他们踩在雪地上的脚步声后，心里想的不会是“有客人！好高兴！”，而是“这他妈叫什么事儿！”。他们大概也会料到，只穿着袜子和内裤、手持一杆七十多年老猎枪的欧维，会上演中年半裸排屋版《第一滴血》，然后一脚踹开大门。或许阿德里安就不会发出一声穿透整条街的尖叫，也不会惊慌失措地扭头撞向储藏室，差点撞晕过去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There's no modern pop song on the radio, Ove hears, when he comes back into the hall and picks up the rifle again. It's the local news bulletin. So he stays where he is for a moment and listens. Not that it's so important to listen to the local news when you're about to shoot yourself in the head, but Ove thinks there's no harm in keeping yourself updated. They talk about the weather. And the economy. And the traffic. And the importance of local property owners staying vigilant over the weekend because of a large number of burglary rings on the rampage all over town. "Bloody hooligans," Ove mutters, and grips the rifle a little more firmly when he hears that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但现在收音机里没有时髦流行乐，欧维回到门厅里拿起枪的时候，耳朵里听到的是《晚间地方新闻》，于是他站着听了一会儿。对即将往自己脑门上开枪的人来说，并非《晚间地方新闻》有多重要，但欧维觉得，哪怕现在与时俱进一下也没什么损失。收音机里讲讲天气，讲讲经济，讲讲交通，还讲到本周末当地别墅和排屋居民要格外提高警惕，因为有一伙入室盗窃的惯犯将横行整个城市。“该死的流氓。”欧维嘟囔一声，双手把猎枪握得更紧。">查看中文翻译</div>
