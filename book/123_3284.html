<div class="line_en">The moving, questing people were migrants now. Those families which had lived on a little piece of land, who had lived and died on forty acres, had eaten or starved on the produce of forty acres, had now the whole West to rove in. And they scampered about, looking for work; and the highways were streams of people, and the ditch banks were lines of people. Behind them more were coming. The great highways streamed with moving people. There in the Middle-and Southwest had lived a simple agrarian folk who had not changed with industry, who had not formed with machines or known the power and danger of machines in private hands. They had not grown up in the paradoxes of industry. Their senses were still sharp to the ridiculousness of the industrial life.</div>

<div class="line_en">And then suddenly the machines pushed them out and they swarmed on the highways. The movement changed them; the highways, the camps along the road, the fear of hunger and the hunger itself, changed them. The children without dinner changed them, the endless moving changed them. They were migrants. And the hostility changed them, welded them, united them -- hostility that made the little towns group and arm as though to repel an invader, squads with pick handles, clerks and storekeepers with shotguns, guarding the world against their own people.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="忽然间，机械把他们赶了出来，于是他们便拥集在公路上了。流动生活使他们起了变化；公路和沿途的停宿场，以及饥饿的恐怖和饥饿本身，都使他们起了变化。吃不上饭的孩子们使他们起了变化，不住的流动生活使他们起了变化。他们成了流民了。他们所遭到的敌视使他们起了变化，使他们融为一体、团结起来了，而针对他们的敌意也使各个小市镇结成了集团，武装起来，仿佛要驱逐侵略者一般；自卫队带了铁镐把儿，店主和店员带了散弹枪，要守卫这世界，防御自己同胞的侵袭。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The local people whipped themselves into a mold of cruelty. Then they formed units, squads, and armed them -- armed them with clubs, with gas, with guns. We own the country. We can't let these Okies get out of hand. And the men who were armed did not own the land, but they thought they did. And the clerks who drilled at night owned nothing, and the little storekeepers possessed only a drawerful of debts. But even a debt is something, even a job is something. The clerk thought, I get fifteen dollars a week. S'pose a goddamn Okie would work for twelve? And the little storekeeper thought, How could I compete with a debtless man?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当地的人使自己的性情变得残暴起来了。他们组成了队伍，武装起来——用棍棒、用瓦斯、用枪械武装起来了。这一带地方是我们所有的。我们不能让这些俄克佬来胡作非为。其实那些武装的人并不是土地的主人，只是自以为土地是他们的。那些在夜间操练的店员其实都没有产业，而那些小店铺的老板也只有一笔债务。然而就连有一笔债也是好的，有个饭碗也是好的。店员们心里想，我挣十五块钱一星期呢。说不定一个讨厌的俄克佬只要十二块就肯干，那可怎么办？小店铺的老板心里想，我怎么能跟一个不负债的人竞争呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And the latter was true, for how can a man without property know the ache of ownership? And the defending people said, They bring disease, they're filthy. We can't have them, in the schools. They're strangers. How'd you like to have your sister go out with one of 'em?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后这句话倒是恰当的，因为没有产业的人怎么会知道有产业人的痛痒呢？自卫的人又说，他们带来了疾病，他们是肮脏的。我们不能让他们进学校。他们是外地人。你难道会让你的姐妹跟他们那种人一同出去玩吗？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the West there was panic when the migrants multiplied on the highways. Men of property were terrified for their property. Men who had never been hungry saw the eyes of the hungry. Men who had never wanted anything very much saw the flare of want in the eyes of the migrants. And the men of the towns and of the soft suburban country gathered to defend themselves; and they reassured themselves that they were good and the invaders bad, as a man must do before he fights. They said, These goddamned Okies are dirty and ignorant. They're degenerate, sexual maniacs. These goddamned Okies are thieves. They'll steal anything. They've got no sense of property rights.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="公路上的流民越来越多的时候，西部发生了一场大惊慌。有产业的人为了自己的财产担惊受怕。从来没有饿过肚子的人看到了挨饿人的眼色。从来不曾急切地感到过缺少什么的人看到了流民眼睛里射出贫困的闪光。于是市镇上和舒适的郊区的人聚拢来自卫了；他们都认定自己是好人，侵略者是坏人，这种心理是准备作战的人所必有的。他们说，这些讨厌的俄克佬又脏又蠢。他们都是些堕落的、害色情狂的家伙。俄克佬都是小偷。他们什么都偷。他们一点没有尊重财产主权的观念。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And the migrants streamed in on the highways and their hunger was in their eyes, and their need was in their eyes. They had no argument, no system, nothing but their numbers and their needs. When there was work for a man, ten men fought for it -- fought with a low wage. If that fella'll work for thirty cents, I'll work for twenty-five.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="流民们从各条公路上川流不息地涌来，他们的眼睛里流露出饥饿的神色，流露出求生的渴望。他们既不会讲道理，也没有什么规章，只仗着人数众多和他们的穷困。只要有一个人的工作，就有十个人来争夺——不惜降低工价来争夺。如果那个人只要三角钱就肯干，我只要两角五分就行了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And now the great owners and the companies invented a new method. A great owner bought a cannery. And when the peaches and the pears were ripe he cut the price of fruit below the cost of raising it. And as cannery owner he paid himself a low price for the fruit and kept the price of canned goods up and took his profit. And the little farmers who owned no canneries lost their farms, and they were taken by the great owners, the banks, and the companies who also owned the canneries. As time went on, there were fewer farms. The little farmers moved into town for a while and exhausted their credit, exhausted their friends, their relatives. And then they too went on the highways. And the roads were crowded with men ravenous for work, murderous for work.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在大业主们和各公司又想出了一种新办法。一个大业主把一家罐头厂顶过来。等到桃子和梨子成熟了，他便把水果的价格压到成本以下。这罐头厂的老板用低价收购了水果，却把罐头制品的价格抬得很高，借此获取利润。于是不开罐头厂的小农户丧失了他们的农场，那些农场便由那些兼营罐头厂的大业主、银行和公司收买过去。日子久了，农场便越来越少。小农户们暂时搬进城市里去，耗尽了他们的资财，把他们的亲戚朋友也拖穷了。于是他们也到公路上去流浪了。路上到处都拥挤着许多人，大家都像饿狼似的找工作，穷凶极恶地找工作。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="不行，我饿着肚子呢。我只要一角五分就行了。我只要有饭吃就干。还有孩子们。你去瞧瞧他们吧。全身长起了小脓疮，跑也跑不动。拿些风刮掉的水果给他们吃，他们的肚子就胀大了。我呢，我要干活去挣钱买点肉吃。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And this was good, for wages went down and prices stayed up. The great owners were glad and they sent out more handbills to bring more people in. And wages went down and prices stayed up. And pretty soon now we'll have serfs again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这倒很好，因为工价越来越低，物价越涨越高。大业主们高兴了，他们发出更多的传单，招来更多的人。于是工价再低下去，物价再往上涨。不久以后，我们又可以有农奴了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And the companies, the banks worked at their own doom and they did not know it. The fields were fruitful, and starving men moved on the roads. The granaries were full and the children of the poor grew up rachitic, and the pustules of pellagra swelled on their sides. The great companies did not know that the line between hunger and anger is a thin line. And money that might have gone to wages went for gas, for guns, for agents and spies, for blacklists, for drilling. On the highways the people moved like ants and searched for work, for food. And the anger began to ferment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那些银行和公司也在自寻死路，但是他们自己却不知道。田野里收成很好，挨饿的人却在路上流离失所。谷仓里装满了粮食，穷人的孩子却害佝偻病，身上还生着糙皮病和脓疮。那些大公司不知道饥饿和愤怒之间的距离是很近的。本该用来付工资的钱却用来买瓦斯和枪械，用来雇特务和密探，用来按黑名单捕人，用来训练打手。公路上的人像蚂蚁一般流动着，寻找工作，寻找食物。于是愤怒开始酝酿起来了。">查看中文翻译</div>
