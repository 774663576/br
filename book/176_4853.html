<div class="line_en">She could not avoid a profound feeling of rancor toward her husband for having left her alone in the middle of the ocean. Everything of his made her cry: his pajamas under the pillow, his slippers that had always looked to her like an invalid's, the memory of his image in the back of the mirror as he undressed while she combed her hair before bed, the odor of his skin, which was to linger on hers for a long time after his death. She would stop in the middle of whatever she was doing and slap herself on the forehead because she suddenly remembered something she had forgotten to tell him. At every moment countless ordinary questions would come to mind that he alone could answer for her. Once he had told her something that she could not imagine: that amputees suffer pains, cramps, itches, in the leg that is no longer there. That is how she felt without him, feeling his presence where he no longer was.</div>

<div class="line_en">Fermina Daza could not have imagined that her letter, inspired by blind rage, would have been interpreted by Florentino Ariza as a love letter. She had put into it all the fury of which she was capable, her crudest words, the most wounding, most unjust vilifications, which still seemed minuscule to her in light of the enormity of the offense. It was the final act in a bitter exorcism through which she was attempting to come to terms with her new situation. She wanted to be herself again, to recover all that she had been obliged to give up in half a century of servitude that had doubtless made her happy but which, once her husband was dead, did not leave her even the vestiges of her identity. She was a ghost in a strange house that overnight had become immense and solitary and through which she wandered without purpose, asking herself in anguish which of them was deader: the man who had died or the woman he had left behind.</div>

<div class="line_en">When she awoke on her first morning as a widow, she turned over in bed without opening her eyes, searching for a more comfortable position so that she could continue sleeping, and that was the moment when he died for her. For only then did it become clear that he had spent the night away from home for the first time in years. The other place where this struck her was at the table, not because she felt alone, which in fact she was, but because of her strange belief that she was eating with someone who no longer existed. It was not until her daughter Ofelia came from New Orleans with her husband and the three girls that she sat at a table again to eat, but instead of the usual one, she ordered a smaller, improvised table set up in the corridor. Until then she did not take a regular meal. She would walk through the kitchen at any hour, whenever she was hungry, and put her fork in the pots and eat a little of everything without placing anything on a plate, standing in front of the stove, talking to the serving women, who were the only ones with whom she felt comfortable, the ones she got along with best. Still, no matter how hard she tried, she could not elude the presence of her dead husband: wherever she went, wherever she turned, no matter what she was doing, she would come across something of his that would remind her of him. For even though it seemed only decent and right to grieve for him, she also wanted to do everything possible not to wallow in her grief. And so she made the drastic decision to empty the house of everything that would remind her of her dead husband, which was the only way she could think of to go on living without him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当她在成为寡妇后的第一个早晨醒来，闭着眼睛在床上翻了个身，想找一个更舒服的姿势继续睡下去，就在这一刻，她才真正意识到他死了。也只有在这时，她才察觉到，这是他多年来第一次没有在家过夜。另一个触动她的情境是在餐桌前，但不是因为感到孤单，尽管事实的确如此，而是因为她奇怪地相信，自己正在同某个已不存在的人一起用餐。直到她女儿奥菲利娅跟丈夫带着他们的三个女儿一起从新奥尔良来了以后，她才再次来到餐桌前吃饭，但也没用以前一直用的那张桌子，而是换了一张她让人放在走廊里、小一些的临时餐桌。在此之前，她没有正经吃过一顿饭。饿的时候，她就随时走进厨房，把叉子伸进锅里，有什么就吃点什么，也并不用盘子，而是站在火炉前，边吃边同女佣们说说话，她们是唯一能让她感到轻松一些、好过一些的人。然而，无论怎样努力，她死去的丈夫都仿佛无处不在：不论她去哪儿，从哪里走过，也不论做什么事情，都会碰到某件他的东西，让她又想起他来。尽管在她看来，悲痛是忠贞的，也是合理的，但她还是希望尽一切可能不在痛苦中沉迷下去。于是，她做出一个极端的决定：将所有能让她想起亡夫的东西全部清出家门，这也是她唯一能想到的办法，唯有这样才能让自己在没有他的情况下活下去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a ritual of eradication. Her son agreed to take his library so that she could replace his office with the sewing room she had never had when she was married. And her daughter would take some furniture and countless objects that she thought were just right for the antique auctions in New Orleans. All of this was a relief for Fermina Daza, although she was not at all amused to learn that the things she had bought on her honeymoon were now relics for antiquarians. To the silent stupefaction of the servants, the neighbors, the women friends who came to visit her during that time, she had a bonfire built in a vacant lot behind the house, and there she burned everything that reminded her of her husband: the most expensive and elegant clothes seen in the city since the last century, the finest shoes, the hats that resembled him more than his portraits, the siesta rocking chair from which he had arisen for the last time to die, innumerable objects so tied to her life that by now they formed part of her identity. She did it without the shadow of a doubt, in the full certainty that her husband would have approved, and not only for reasons of hygiene. For he had often expressed his desire to be cremated and not shut away in the seamless dark of a cedar box. His religion would not permit it, of course: he had dared to broach the subject with the Archbishop, just in case, and his answer had been a categorical no. It was pure illusion, because the Church did not permit the existence of crematoriums in our cemeteries, not even for the use of religions other than Catholic, and the advantage of building them would not have occurred to anyone but Juvenal Urbino. Fermina Daza did not forget her husband's terror, and even in the confusion of the first hours she remembered to order the carpenter to leave a chink where light could come into the coffin as a consolation to him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是一次毁灭性的清理仪式。儿子同意将书房里的所有东西都搬走，好让她把这里改成缝纫室，自结婚以来，她还从没有过一间缝纫室。女儿则会带走一些家具和许多件她觉得适合在新奥尔良的古董行里拍卖的东西。这一切都让费尔明娜·达萨轻松了许多，尽管当她了解到自己在新婚旅行中买回来的东西已变成了古董商的文物时，心中有些不快。她不顾佣人、邻居以及那些日子赶来陪她的女友们沉默的惊愕，让人在房子后面的空地上点起一堆篝火，一股脑儿地烧掉了所有能使她回忆起丈夫的东西：上世纪以来城中所能见到的最昂贵、最考究的衣服，最精致的鞋子，比照片还像他本人的帽子，他临死前从上面起身的午睡摇椅，以及无数件与他的生活息息相关、已成为他本人一部分的物品。她做这些时没有一丝犹豫，完全确信丈夫也会同意这样做，还不仅仅是出于卫生的考虑。他曾多次表达过死后火化的愿望，不愿被囚禁在那黑暗的、没有一丝缝隙的雪松木盒子里。当然，他信奉的宗教禁止他这样做：他曾大着胆子探问过大主教的看法，但大主教斩钉截铁地予以否定。这纯属妄想，教会绝不会允许在我们的墓地上设置火葬炉，即便是专供非天主教徒使用也不行。事实上，除了胡维纳尔·乌尔比诺，谁也看不出这样做有什么好处。但费尔明娜·达萨深深记得丈夫的恐惧，即便是在最初那几个小时的恍惚中，她也没有忘记吩咐木匠在棺材上留一道能透光的缝隙，以此作为对丈夫的安慰。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At the end of the third week, in fact, she began to see the first light. But as it grew larger and brighter, she became aware that there was an evil phantom in her life who did not give her a moment's peace. He was not the pitiable phantom who had haunted her in the Park of the Evangels and whom she had evoked with a certain tenderness after she had grown old, but the hateful phantom with his executioner's frock coat and his hat held against his chest, whose thoughtless impertinence had disturbed her so much that she found it impossible not to think about him. Ever since her rejection of him at the age of eighteen, she had been convinced that she had left behind a seed of hatred in him that could only grow larger with time. She had always counted on that hatred, she had felt it in the air when the phantom was near, and the mere sight of him had upset and frightened her so that she never found a natural way to behave with him. On the night when he reiterated his love for her, while the flowers for her dead husband were still perfuming the house, she could not believe that his insolence was not the first step in God knows what sinister plan for revenge.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="果然，三个星期以后，她开始看到曙光。可是随着光线越来越强，越来越清晰，她逐渐意识到自己的生活中有一个居心叵测的幽灵，让她一刻也不得安宁。他已不是当年那个在福音花园偷偷窥视她的让人可怜的幽灵，不是那个她进入暮年以后还时常怀着某种柔情想起的幽灵，而是那个穿着刽子手的长礼服、把帽子拿在胸前的令人厌恶的幽灵。他愚蠢的无礼行为让她心烦不已，以至于总是挥之不去。自从十八岁那年拒绝他以后，她一直觉得自己在他身上播下了仇恨的种子，而时间将使这种子生根发芽。她时刻都感觉到这种仇恨，每当这个幽灵离她很近，她都能在空气中闻到仇恨的味道，单是看他一眼，就使她心慌意乱。她是那么怕他，以至于在他面前，她始终找不到一种自然的方式让自己举止得体。那天晚上，当他向她重申爱情时，纪念亡夫的鲜花所散发的芳香还在房子里弥漫，她不能不把这种无礼的言行视作他报复行为的第一步，谁又知道这之后究竟还隐藏着多少阴险的企图呢。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In any event, the holocaust was in vain. In a very short while Fermina Daza realized that the memory of her dead husband was as resistant to the fire as it seemed to be to the passage of time. Even worse: after the incineration of his clothing, she continued to miss not only the many things she had loved in him but also what had most annoyed her: the noises he made on arising. That memory helped her to escape the mangrove swamps of grief. Above all else, she made the firm decision to go on with her life, remembering her husband as if he had not died. She knew that waking each morning would continue to be difficult, but it would become less and less so.</div>

<div class="line_en">Her persistent memory of him increased her rage. When she awoke thinking about him on the day after the funeral, she succeeded in removing him from her thoughts by a simple act of will. But the rage always returned, and she realized very soon that the desire to forget him was the strongest inducement for remembering him. Then, overcome by nostalgia, she dared to recall for the first time the illusory days of that unreal love. She tried to remember just how the little park was then, and the shabby almond trees, and the bench where he had loved her, because none of it still existed as it had been then. They had changed everything, they had removed the trees with their carpet of yellow leaves and replaced the statue of the decapitated hero with that of another, who wore his dress uniform but had no name or dates or reasons to justify him, and who stood on an ostentatious pedestal in which they had installed the electrical controls for the district. Her house, sold many years before, had fallen into total ruin at the hands of the Provincial Government. It was not easy for her to imagine Florentino Ariza as he had been then, much less to believe that the taciturn boy, so vulnerable in the rain, was the moth-eaten old wreck who had stood in front of her with no consideration for her situation, or the slightest respect for her grief, and had seared her soul with a flaming insult that still made it difficult for her to breathe.</div>

<div class="line_en">Cousin Hildebranda Sánchez had come to visit a short while after Fermina Daza returned from the ranch in Flores de María, where she had gone to recuperate from the misfortune of Miss Lynch. Old, fat, and contented, she had arrived in the company of her oldest son who, like his father, had been a colonel in the army but had been repudiated by him because of his contemptible behavior during the massacre of the banana workers in San Juan de la Ciénaga. The two cousins saw each other often and spent endless hours feeling nostalgia for the time when they first met. On her last visit, Hildebranda was more nostalgic than ever, and very affected by the burden of old age. In order to add even greater poignancy to their memories, she had brought her copy of the portrait of them dressed as old-fashioned ladies, taken by the Belgian photographer on the afternoon that a young Juvenal Urbino had delivered the coup de grace to a willful Fermina Daza. Her copy of the photograph had been lost, and Hildebranda's was almost invisible, but they could both recognize themselves through the mists of disenchantment: young and beautiful as they would never be again.</div>

<div class="line_en">For Hildebranda it was impossible not to speak of Florentino Ariza, because she always identified his fate with her own. She evoked him as she evoked the day she had sent her first telegram, and she could never erase from her heart the memory of the sad little bird condemned to oblivion. For her part, Fermina had often seen him without speaking to him, of course, and she could not imagine that he had been her first love. She always heard news about him, as sooner or later she heard news about anyone of any significance in the city. It was said that he had not married because of his unusual habits, but she paid no attention to this, in part because she never paid attention to rumors, and in part because such things were said in any event about men who were above suspicion. On the other hand, it seemed strange to her that Florentino Ariza would persist in his mystic attire and his rare lotions, and that he would continue to be so enigmatic after making his way in life in so spectacular and honorable a manner. It was impossible for her to believe he was the same person, and she was always surprised when Hildebranda would sigh: "Poor man, how he must have suffered!"

<div class="line_en">The mortal rage of the first shock remained intact after the symbolic cremation of her husband, and it grew and spread as she felt herself less capable of controlling it. Even worse: the spaces in her mind where she managed to appease her memories of the dead man were slowly but inexorably being taken over by the field of poppies where she had buried her memories of Florentino Ariza. And so she thought about him without wanting to, and the more she thought about him the angrier she became, and the angrier she became the more she thought about him, until it was something so unbearable that her mind could no longer contain it. Then she sat down at her dead husband's desk and wrote Florentino Ariza a letter consisting of three irrational pages so full of insults and base provocations that it brought her the consolation of consciously committing the vilest act of her long life.</div>

<div class="line_en">Nevertheless, on the night she met him in the movie theater just after her return from Flores de María, something strange occurred in her heart. She was not surprised that he was with a woman, and a black woman at that. What did surprise her was that he was so well preserved, that he behaved with the greatest self-assurance, and it did not occur to her that perhaps it was she, not he, who had changed after the troubling explosion of Miss Lynch in her private life. From then on, and for more than twenty years, she saw him with more compassionate eyes. On the night of the vigil for her husband, it not only seemed reasonable for him to be there, but she even understood it as the natural end of rancor: an act of forgiving and forgetting. That was why she was so taken aback by his dramatic reiteration of a love that for her had never existed, at an age when Florentino Ariza and she could expect nothing more from life.</div>

<div class="line_en">Those weeks had been agonizing for Florentino Ariza as well. The night he reiterated his love to Fermina Daza he had wandered aimlessly through streets that had been devastated by the afternoon flood, asking himself in terror what he was going to do with the skin of the tiger he had just killed after having resisted its attacks for more than half a century. The city was in a state of emergency because of the violent rains. In some houses, half-naked men and women were trying to salvage whatever God willed from the flood, and Florentino Ariza had the impression that everyone's calamity had something to do with his own. But the wind was calm and the stars of the Caribbean were quiet in their places. In the sudden silence of other voices, Florentino Ariza recognized the voice of the man whom Leona Cassiani and he had heard singing many years before, at the same hour and on the same corner: I came back from the bridge bathed in tears.

<div class="line_en">At the other end of the city was Leona Cassiani, alone and free and doubtless ready to provide him with the compassion he needed at two o'clock in the morning, at three o'clock, at any hour and under any circumstances. It would not be the first time he had knocked at her door in the wasteland of his sleepless nights, but he knew that she was too intelligent, and that they loved each other too much, for him to come crying to her lap and not tell her the reason. After a good deal of thought as he sleepwalked through the deserted city, it occurred to him that he could do no better than Prudencia Pitre, the Widow of Two, who was younger than he. They had first met in the last century, and if they stopped meeting it was because she refused to allow anyone to see her as she was, half blind and verging on decrepitude. As soon as he thought of her, Florentino Ariza returned to the Street of the Windows, put two bottles of port and a jar of pickles in a shopping bag, and went to visit her, not even knowing if she was still in her old house, if she was alone, or if she was alive.</div>

He was surprised at how much she had aged since the last time he saw her, and he was aware that she saw him the same way.

She had been awakened from her siesta by the thundering artillery that made the earth tremble, by the dissonances of the marching bands, the confusion of funeral hymns over the clamoring bells in all the churches, which had been ringing without pause since the previous day. From her balcony she had seen the cavalry in dress uniform, the religious communities, the schools, the long black limousines of an invisible officialdom, the carriage drawn by horses in feathered headdresses and gold trappings, the flag-draped yellow coffin on the gun carriage of a historic cannon, and at the very end a line of old open Victorias that kept themselves alive in order to carry funeral wreaths.

But no other man was as elusive either, so that their love never went beyond the point it always reached for him: the point where it would not interfere with his determination to remain free for Fermina Daza.

<div class="line_en">Florentino Ariza, in a state of agitation that he could not calm with four glasses of port, talked at length about the same subject: the past, the good memories from the past, for he was desperate to find the hidden road in the past that would bring him relief. For that was what he needed: to let his soul escape through his mouth. When he saw the first light of dawn on the horizon, he attempted an indirect approach. He asked, in a way that seemed casual: "What would you do if someone proposed marriage to you, just as you are, a widow of your age?" She laughed with a wrinkled old woman's laugh, and asked in turn:</div>

<div class="line_en">They talked, not concerned about the hour, because both were accustomed to sharing the sleepless nights of their youth, and they had much less to lose in the sleeplessness of old age. Although he almost never had more than two glasses of wine, Florentino Ariza still had not caught his breath after the third. He was dripping with perspiration, and the Widow of Two told him to take off his jacket, his vest, his trousers, to take off everything if he liked, what the hell: after all, they knew each other better naked than dressed. He said he would if she did the same, but she refused: some time ago she had looked at herself in the wardrobe mirror and suddenly realized that she would no longer have the courage to allow anyone -- not him, not anyone -- to see her undressed.</div>

She laughed again: "Go make fun of your bitch of a mother, may she rest in peace."

The voice of América Vicuña playing ball in the garden with the servant girls brought him back to reality: he was in his mother's bed. He had kept her bedroom intact, and he would sleep there to feel less alone on the few occasions when he was troubled by his solitude. Across from the bed hung the large mirror from Don Sancho's Inn, and he had only to see it when he awoke to see Fermina Daza reflected in its depths. He knew that it was Saturday, because that was the day the chauffeur picked up América Vicuña at her boarding school and brought her back to his house. He realized that he had slept without knowing it, dreaming that he could not sleep, in a dream that had been disturbed by the wrathful face of Fermina Daza. He bathed, wondering what his next step should be, he dressed very slowly in his best clothing, he dabbed on cologne and waxed the ends of his white mustache, he left the bedroom, and from the second-floor hallway he saw the beautiful child in her uniform catching the ball with the grace that had made him tremble on so many Saturdays but this morning did not disquiet him in the least. He indicated that she should come with him, and before he climbed into the automobile he said, although it was not necessary: "Today we are not going to do our things." He took her to the American Ice Cream Shop, filled at this hour with parents eating ice cream with their children under the long blades of the fans that hung from the smooth ceiling. América Vicuña ordered an enormous glass filled with layers of ci e cream, each a different color, her favorite dish and the one that was the most popular because it gave off an aura of magic. Florentino Ariza drank black coffee and looked at the girl without speaking, while she ate the ice cream with a spoon that had a very long handle so that one could reach the bottom of the glass.

<div class="line_en">It was eight o'clock at night. The two servant girls were in bed, and they had left on the light in the hallway that lit Florentino Ariza's way to his bedroom. He knew that his Spartan, bland supper was on the table in the dining room, but the slight hunger he felt after so many days of haphazard eating vanished with the emotional upheaval of the letter. His hands were shaking so much that it was difficult for him to turn on the overhead light in the bedroom. He put the rain-soaked letter on the bed, lit the lamp on the night table, and with the feigned tranquillity that was his customary way of calming himself, he took off his wet jacket and hung it on the back of the chair, he took off his vest, folded it with care, and placed it on top of the jacket, he took off his black silk string tie and the celluloid collar that was no longer fashionable in the world, he unbuttoned his shirt down to his waist and loosened his belt so that he could breathe with greater ease, and at last he took off his hat and put it by the window to dry. Then he began to tremble because he did not know where the letter was, and his nervous excitement was so great that he was surprised when he found it, for he did not remember placing it on the bed. Before opening it, he dried the envelope with his handkerchief, taking care not to smear the ink in which his name was written, and as he did so it occurred to him that the secret was no longer shared by two people but by three, at least, for whoever had delivered it must have noticed that only three weeks after the death of her husband, the Widow Urbino was writing to someone who did not belong to her world, and with so much urgency that she did not use the regular mails and so much secretiveness that she had ordered that it not be handed to anyone but slipped under the door instead, as if it were an anonymous letter. He did not have to tear open the envelope, for the water had dissolved the glue, but the letter was dry: three closely written pages with no salutation, and signed with the initials of her married name.</div>

<div class="line_en">He sat on the bed and read it through once as quickly as he could, more intrigued by the tone than by the content, and before he reached the second page he knew that it was in fact the insulting letter he had expected to receive. He laid it, unfolded, in the light shed by the bed-lamp, he took off his shoes and his wet socks, he turned out the overhead light, using the switch next to the door, and at last he put on his chamois mustache cover and lay down without removing his trousers and shirt, his head supported by two large pillows that he used as a backrest for reading. Now he read it again, this time syllable by syllable, scrutinizing each so that none of the letter's secret intentions would be hidden from him, and then he read it four more times, until he was so full of the written words that they began to lose all meaning. At last he placed it, without the envelope, in the drawer of the night table, lay on his back with his hands behind his head, and for four hours he did not blink, he hardly breathed, he was more dead than a dead man, as he stared into the space in the mirror where she had been. Precisely at midnight he went to the kitchen and prepared a thermos of coffee as thick as crude oil, then he took it to his room, put his false teeth into the glass of boric acid solution that he always found ready for him on the night table, and resumed the posture of a recumbent marble statue, with momentary shifts in position when he took a sip of coffee, until the maid came in at six o'clock with a fresh thermos.</div>

<div class="line_en">Florentino Ariza knew by then what one of his next steps was going to be. In truth, the insults caused him no pain, and he was not concerned with rectifying the unjust accusations that could have been worse, considering Fermina Daza's character and the gravity of the cause. All that interested him was that the letter, in and of itself, gave him the opportunity, and even recognized his right, to respond. Even more: it demanded that he respond. So that life was now at the point where he had wanted it to be. Everything else depended on him, and he was convinced that his private hell of over half a century's duration would still present him with many mortal challenges, which he was prepared to confront with more ardor and more sorrow and more love than he had brought to any of them before now, because these would be the last.</div>

<div class="line_en">When he went to his office five days after receiving the letter from Fermina Daza, he felt as if he were floating in an abrupt and unusual absence of the noise of the typewriters, whose sound, like rain, had become less noticeable than silence. It was a moment of calm. When the sound began again, Florentino Ariza went to Leona Cas-siani's office and watched her as she sat in front of her own personal typewriter, which responded to her fingertips as if it were human. She knew she was being observed, and she looked toward the door with her awesome solar smile, but she did not stop typing until the end of the paragraph.</div>

<div class="line_en">For that very reason she could make no other reply. Florentino Ariza had not thought of it either until that moment, and he decided to risk it with no reservations. He took one of the office typewriters home, his subordinates joking good-naturedly: "You can't teach an old dog new tricks." Leona Cassiani, enthusiastic about anything new, offered to give him typing lessons at home. But he had been opposed to methodical learning ever since Lotario Thugut had wanted to teach him to play the violin by reading notes and warned him that he would need at least a year to begin, five more to qualify for a professional orchestra, and six hours a day for the rest of his life in order to play well. And yet he had convinced his mother to buy him a blind man's violin, and with the five basic rules given him by Lotario Thugut, in less than a year he had dared to play in the choir of the Cathedral and to serenade Fermina Daza from the paupers" cemetery according to the direction of the winds. If that had been the case at the age of twenty, with something as difficult as the violin, he did not see why it could not also be the case at the age of seventy-six, with a one-finger instrument like the typewriter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因此，她也就无法做出其他回答。而在此之前，弗洛伦蒂诺·阿里萨也没有想过这种可能性，但他决定冒险到底。他将办公室的一台打字机搬回家，引来下属一片友好的嘲笑：“老鹦鹉是学不会说话的啦。”莱昂娜·卡西亚尼对任何新鲜事都抱有热情，自告奋勇到家中去给他上打字课。可是，自从洛达里奥·图古特想教他按照乐谱拉小提琴的时候起，他就反对系统学习。洛达里奥·图古特吓唬他说，入门至少需要一年，要想得到专业管弦乐队的认可，需要五年，而若想真真正正拉好琴，则需要一生的时间，而且每天都要练习六个钟头。可他最终说服母亲给他买了一把盲人小提琴，按照洛达里奥·图古特教给他的五条基本规则练了不到一年，就敢去大教堂的唱诗班里演奏，还能从贫民墓地根据风向为费尔明娜·达萨送去一首首小夜曲。如果说能在二十岁学会像拉小提琴这样困难的事，他想不出自己为何就不能在七十六岁学会像打字这样只需要动用一根手指的活计。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a six-page letter, unlike any he had ever written before. It did not have the tone, or the style, or the rhetorical air of his early years of love, and his argument was so rational and measured that the scent of a gardenia would have been out of place. In a certain sense it was his closest approximation to the business letters he had never been able to write. Years later, a typed personal letter would be considered almost an insult, but at that time the typewriter was still an office animal without its own code of ethics, and its domestication for personal use was not foreseen in the books on etiquette. It seemed more like bold modernity, which was how Fermina Daza must have understood it, for in her second letter to Florentino Ariza, she began by begging his pardon for any difficulties in reading her handwriting, since she did not have at her disposal any means more advanced than her steel pen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是一封六页的信，和过去他写过的任何一封信都大相径庭。没有了初恋时的语气、文风和飘逸修辞，论述得如此合情合理，而且恰如其分，以至于若配上栀子花的香气都会显得唐突。在某种意义上说，这是他写得最接近商业信函的信，尽管他从来也没写好过这类信件。多年以后，一封用机器打出的私人信件几乎会被视作一种侮辱，但在当时，打字机还是办公室里的一头猛兽，尚没有自己的伦理特征，礼仪教科书也还没预见到它将被驯化用于私人用途。这更像是一种大胆的现代主义行为，至少费尔明娜·达萨定是这样理解的，因为就在她写给弗洛伦蒂诺·阿里萨的第二封信中，一开头就请求他原谅她潦草的字体，因为她没有比钢笔更先进的书写工具。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was right. He needed three days to learn the position of the letters on the keyboard, another six to learn to think while he typed, and three more to complete the first letter without errors after tearing up half a ream of paper. He gave it a solemn salutation -- Señora -- and signed it with his initial, as he had done in the perfumed love letters of his youth. He mailed it in an envelope with the mourning vignettes that were de rigueur for a letter to a recent widow, and with no return address on the back.</div>

<div class="line_en">Florentino Ariza did not even refer to the terrible letter that she had sent him, but from the very beginning he attempted a new method of seduction, without any reference to past loves or even to the past itself: a clean slate. Instead, he wrote an extensive meditation on life based on his ideas about, and experience of, relations between men and women, which at one time he had intended to write as a complement to the Lovers" Companion. Only now he disguised it in the patriarchal style of an old man's memories so that it would not be too obvious that it was really a document of love. First he wrote many drafts in his old style, which took longer to read with a cool head than to throw into the fire. But he knew that any conventional slip, the slightest nostalgic indiscretion, could revive the unpleasant taste of the past in her heart, and although he foresaw her returning a hundred letters to him before she dared open the first, he preferred that it not happen even once. And so he planned everything down to the last detail, as if it were the final battle: new intrigues, new hopes in a woman who had already lived a full and complete life. It had to be a mad dream, one that would give her the courage she would need to discard the prejudices of a class that had not always been hers but had become hers more than anyone's. It had to teach her to think of love as a state of grace: not the means to anything but the alpha and omega, an end in itself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="弗洛伦蒂诺·阿里萨在信中甚至都没有提到她寄给他的那封可怕的信，而是从一开始就试图采取一种截然不同的方式诱导她，对过去的爱情只字不提，连带过去的一切都不再提起：所有往事一笔勾销，一切重新开始。他写下的更像是对人生的一种广泛性的思考，依据的是多年来他对男女之间关系的看法和经验，他曾一度想把这些作为《恋人指南》的增订本写出来，只不过此时，他把这种思考隐藏在一种家长式的淳朴文风之下，如同一个老者的回忆，为的就是不那么明显地被人看出，这实际上是一封倾诉爱情的书信。他原本也按照旧时的文风写了很多份草稿，但以冷静的头脑一读再读之后，最终在一瞬间把它们付诸一炬。他知道，任何一个不起眼的疏忽，或者哪怕轻率流露出的一点点怀旧之情，都可能搅起她对往事的反感。虽然他预料到她有可能在鼓足勇气打开第一封信之前先退上个上百封信，但还是盼望这样的事一次也不要发生。所以，他像筹划最后一场决战那样，对每个细枝末节都思虑周详：一切都要与众不同，如此方能在一个于巅峰上过完一生的女人心中激起新的好奇、新的兴致和新的希望。这封信应该要提供一种蠢蠢欲动的幻想，并且给予她足够的勇气，把某个阶层的不公偏见扔进垃圾堆里去。她原本并不出身于那个阶层，可那个阶层最终却变得比其他任何阶层都更像她的出身之处。这封信应该教会她把爱情想成一种美好的状态，而非达到任何目的的途径，爱情自有其本身的起点和终点。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He had the good sense not to expect an immediate reply, to be satisfied if the letter was not returned to him. It was not, nor were any of the ones that followed, and as the days passed, his excitement grew, for the more days that passed without her letters being returned, the greater his hope of a reply. In the beginning, the frequency of his letters was conditioned by the dexterity of his fingers: first one a week, then two, and at last one a day. He was happy about the progress made in the mail service since his days as a standard-bearer, for he would not have risked being seen every day in the post office mailing a letter to the same person, or sending it with someone who might talk. On the other hand, it was very easy to send an employee to buy enough stamps for a month, and then slip the letter into one of the three mailboxes located in the old city. He soon made that ritual a part of his routine: he took advantage of his insomnia to write, and the next day, on his way to the office, he would ask the driver to stop for a moment at a corner box, and he would get out to mail the letter. He never allowed the chauffeur to do it for him, as he attempted to do one rainy morning, and at times he took the precaution of carrying several letters rather than just one, so that it would seem more natural. The chauffeur did not know, of course, that the additional letters were blank pages that Florentino Ariza addressed to himself, for he had never carried on a private correspondence with anyone, with the exception of the guardian's report that he sent at the end of each month to the parents of América Vicuña, with his personal impressions of the girl's conduct, her state of mind and health, and the progress she was making in her studies.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他清楚地知道不能期待立刻得到答复，其实只要信不退回，他也就心满意足了。这封信果然没有退回来，以后的每一封也都没有退回来。随着日子一天天过去，他的焦虑与日俱增。越久不见退信，他就越希望得到一封回信。一开始，他写信的频率取决于他手指的灵活程度：先是每星期一封，后来每星期两封，最后是每天一封。对于邮电事业从他当旗手的时代到目前为止所取得的进步，他备感欣慰，因为他不必再冒被人发现每天到邮局去给同一个人寄信的风险，也不必冒险找人送信，因为这人有可能把事情说出去。相反，只要派一个职员买回能用上一个月的邮票，再把信塞进分布在老城区的三个邮筒中的任何一个，这简直易如反掌。很快，他把这个习惯纳入了他的生活常规：他利用不眠的夜晚写信，然后在第二天去办公室的路上，让司机在街角的邮筒前停一分钟，自己下车亲自把信放进去。他从不让司机代他投信，尽管在一个雨天的早晨，司机曾想帮他这样做。还有时，他小心谨慎，不止带一封信，而是同时带上好几封，为了显得更加自然。司机当然不知道，那些凑数的信件不过是弗洛伦蒂诺·阿里萨寄给自己的几张白纸，因为他从不与任何人互通私人信件，除了每个月末会写信给阿美利加·维库尼亚的父母，作为监护人汇报一下他对姑娘的行为、精神状态、健康情况以及她在学习上取得的好成绩的个人印象。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After the first month he began to number the letters and to head them with a synopsis of the previous ones, as in the serialized novels in the newspapers, for fear that Fermina Daza would not realize that they had a certain continuity. When they became daily letters, moreover, he replaced the envelopes that had mourning vignettes with long white envelopes, and this gave them the added impersonality of business letters. When he began, he was prepared to subject his patience to a crucial test, at least until he had proof that he was wasting his time with the only new approach he could think of. He waited, in fact, not with the many kinds of suffering that waiting had caused him in his youth, but with the stubbornness of an old man made of stone who had nothing else to think about, nothing else to do in a riverboat company that by this time was sailing without his help before favorable winds, and who was also convinced that he would be alive and in perfect possession of his male faculties the next day, or the day after that, or whenever Fermina Daza at last was convinced that there was no other remedy for her solitary widow's yearnings than to lower the drawbridge for him.</div>

In anticipation of a favorable reply, he began a second renovation of his house so that it would be worthy of the woman who could have considered herself its lady and mistress from the day of its purchase. He visited Prudencia Pitre again several times, as he had promised, in order to prove to her that he loved her despite the devastation wrought by age, loved her in full sunlight and with the doors open, and not only on his nights of desolation. He continued to pass by Andrea Varón's house until he found the bathroom light turned off, and he tried to lose himself in the wildness of her bed even though it was only so he would not lose the habit of love, in keeping with another of his superstitions, not disproved so far, that the body carries on for as long as you do.</div>

He had repeated the order to his chauffeur to pick her up on Saturdays at ten o'clock in the morning at the school, but he did not know what to do with her during the weekends. For the first time he did not concern himself with her, and she resented the change. He placed her in the care of the servant girls and had them take her to the afternoon film, to the band concerts in the children's park, to the charity bazaars, or he arranged Sunday activities for her and her classmates so that he would not have to take her to the hidden paradise behind his offices, to which she had always wanted to return after the first time he took her there. In the fog of his new illusion, he did not realize that women can become adults in three days, and that three years had gone by since he had met her boat from Puerto Padre. No matter how he tried to soften the blow, it was a brutal change for her, and she could not imagine the reason for it. On the day in the ice cream parlor when he told her he was going to marry, when he revealed the truth to her, she had reeled with panic, but then the possibility seemed so absurd that she forgot about it. In a very short while, however, she realized that he was behaving with inexplicable evasiveness, as if it was true, as if he were not sixty years older than she, but sixty years younger.</div>

<div class="line_en">One Saturday afternoon, Florentino Ariza found her trying to type in his bedroom, and she was doing rather well, for she was studying typing at school. She had completed more than half a page of automatic writing, but it was not difficult to isolate an occasional phrase that revealed her state of mind. Florentino Ariza leaned over her shoulder to read what she had written. She was disturbed by his man's heat, by his ragged breathing, by the scent on his clothes, which was the same as the scent on his pillow. She was no longer the little girl, the newcomer, whom he had undressed, one article of clothing at a time, with little baby games: first these little shoes for the little baby bear, then this little chemise for the little puppy dog, next these little flowered panties for the little bunny rabbit, and a little kiss on her papa's delicious little dickey-bird. No: now she was a full-fledged woman, who liked to take the initiative. She continued typing with just one finger of her right hand, and with her left she felt for his leg, explored him, found him, felt him come to life, grow, heard him sigh with excitement, and his old man's breathing became uneven and labored. She knew him: from that point on he was going to lose control, his speech would become disjointed, he would be at her mercy, and he would not find his way back until he had reached the end. She led him by the hand to the bed as if he were a blind beggar on the street, and she cut him into pieces with malicious tenderness; she added salt to taste, pepper, a clove of garlic, chopped onion, lemon juice, bay leaf, until he was seasoned and on the platter, and the oven was heated to the right temperature. There was no one in the house. The servant girls had gone out, and the masons and carpenters who were renovating the house did not work on Saturdays: they had the whole world to themselves. But on the edge of the abyss he came out of his ecstasy, moved her hand away, sat up, and said in a tremulous voice:</div>

At the end of six months he had heard nothing at all, and he found himself tossing and turning in bed until dawn, lost in the wasteland of a new kind of insomnia. He thought that Fermina Daza had opened the first letter because of its appearance, had seen the initial she knew from the letters of long ago, and had thrown it out to be burned with the rest of the trash without even taking the trouble to tear it up. Just seeing the envelopes of those that followed would be enough for her to do the same thing without even opening them, and to continue to do so until the end of time, while he came at last to his final written meditation.

She cleaned his lapel with the corner of his napkin dampened in a glass of water, and then she tied it around his neck like a bib to avoid a more serious accident: he looked like an old baby. She noticed that several times during dinner he took off his eyeglasses and dried them with his handkerchief because his eyes were watering. During coffee he fell asleep holding his cup in his hand, and she tried to take it away without waking him, but his embarrassed response was: "I was just resting my eyes."

<div class="line_en">On the first anniversary of the death of Juvenal Urbino, the family sent out invitations to a memorial Mass at the Cathedral. Florentino Ariza had still received no reply, and this was the driving force behind his bold decision to attend the Mass although he had not been invited. It was a social event more ostentatious than emotional. The first few rows of pews were reserved for their lifetime owners, whose names were engraved on copper nameplates on the backs of their seats. Florentino Ariza was among the first to arrive so that he might sit where Fermina Daza could not pass by without seeing him. He thought that the best seats would be in the central nave, behind the reserved pews, but there were so many people he could not find a seat there either, and he had to sit in the nave for poor relations. From there he saw Fermina Daza walk in on her son's arm, dressed in an unadorned long-sleeved black velvet dress buttoned all the way from her neck to the tips of her shoes, like a bishop's cassock, and a narrow scarf of Castilian lace instead of the veiled hat worn by other widows, and even by many other ladies who longed for that condition. Her uncovered face shone like alabaster, her lanceolate eyes had a life of their own under the enormous chandeliers of the central nave, and as she walked she was so erect, so haughty, so self-possessed, that she seemed no older than her son. As he stood, Florentino Ariza leaned the tips of his fingers against the back of the pew until his dizziness passed, for he felt that he and she were not separated by seven paces, but existed in two different times.</div>

But when it was over, she broke with convention and did not stay in her seat, according to the custom of the day, to receive the spiritual renewal of condolences, but made her way instead through the crowd to thank each one of the guests: an innovative gesture that was very much in harmony with her style and character. Greeting one guest after another, she at last reached the pews of the poor relations, and then she looked around to make certain she had not missed anyone she knew. At that moment Florentino Ariza felt a supernatural wind lifting him out of himself: she had seen him. Fermina Daza moved away from her companions with the same assurance she brought to everything in society, held out her hand, and with a very sweet smile, said to him:</div>

She opened it because of the novelty of its being typewritten, and a sudden blush burned her face when she recognized the initial of the signature. But she immediately regained her self-possession and put the letter in her apron pocket. She said: "It is a condolence letter from the government." Her daughter was surprised: "All of them came already." She was imperturbable: "This is another one." Her intention was to burn the letter later, when she was away from her daughter's questions, but she could not resist the temptation of looking it over first. She expected the reply that her insulting letter deserved, a letter that she began to regret the very moment she sent it, but from the majestic salutation and the subject of the first paragraph, she realized that something had changed in the world.

<div class="line_en">It was a meditation on life, love, old age, death: ideas that had often fluttered around her head like nocturnal birds but dissolved into a trickle of feathers when she tried to catch hold of them. There they were, precise, simple, just as she would have liked to say them, and once again she grieved that her husband was not alive to discuss them with her as they used to discuss certain events of the day before going to sleep. In this way an unknown Florentino Ariza was revealed to he r, one possessed of a clear-sightedness that in no way corresponded to the feverish love letters of his youth or to the somber conduct of his entire life. They were, rather, the words of a man who, in the opinion of Aunt Escolástica, was inspired by the Ho ly Spirit, and this thought astounded her now as much as it had the first time.

<div class="line_en">That first year had been enough time for her to adjust to her widowhood. The purified memory of her husband, no longer an obstacle in her daily actions, in her private thoughts, in her simplest intentions, became a watchful presence that guided but did not hinder her. On the occasions when she truly needed him she would see him, not as an apparition but as flesh and blood. She was encouraged by the certainty that he was there, still alive but without his masculine whims, his patriarchal demands, his consuming need for her to love him in the same ritual of inopportune kisses and tender words with which he loved her. For now she understood him better than when he was alive, she understood the yearning of his love, the urgent need he felt to find in her the security that seemed to be the mainstay of his public life and that in reality he never possessed. One day, at the height of desperation, she had shouted at him: "You don't understand how unhappy I am." Unperturbed, he took off his eyeglasses with a characteristic gesture, he flooded her with the transparent waters of his childlike eyes, and in a single phrase he burdened her with the weight of his unbearable wisdom: "Always remember that the most important thing in a good marriage is not happiness, but stability." With the first loneliness of her widowhood she had understood that the phrase did not conceal the miserable threat that she had attributed to it at the time, but was the lodestone that had given them both so many happy hours.</div>

Still, she burned them after reading them with a growing interest, although burning them left her with a sense of guilt that she could not dissipate. So that when they began to be numbered, she found the moral justification she had been seeking for not destroying them. At any rate, her initial intention was not to keep them for herself but to wait for an opportunity to return them to Florentino Ariza so that something that seemed of such great human value would not be lost. The difficulty was that time passed and the letters continued to arrive, one every three or four days throughout the year, and she did not know how to return them without that appearing to be the rebuff she no longer wanted to give, and without having to explain everything in a letter that her pride would not permit her to write.</div>

<div class="line_en">On her many journeys through the world, Fermina Daza had bought every object that attracted her attention because of its novelty. She desired these things with a primitive impulse that her husband was happy to rationalize, and they were beautiful, useful objects as long as they remained in their original environment, in the show windows of Rome, Paris, London, or in the New York, vibrating to the Charleston, where skyscrapers were beginning to grow, but they could not withstand the test of Strauss waltzes with pork cracklings or Poetic Festivals when it was ninety degrees in the shade. And so she would return with half a dozen enormous standing trunks made of polished metal, with copper locks and corners like decorated coffins, lady and mistress of the world's latest marvels, which were worth their price not in gold but in the fleeting moment when someone from her local world would see the m for the first time. For that is why they had been bought: so that others could see them. She became aware of her frivolous public image long before she began to grow old, and in the house she was often heard to say: "We have to get rid of all these trinkets; there's no room to turn around." Dr. Urbino would laugh at her fruitless efforts, for he knew that the emptied spaces were only going to be filled again. But she persisted, because it was true that there was no room for anything else and nothing anywhere served any purpose, not the shirts hanging on the doorknobs or the overcoats for European winters squeezed into the kitchen cupboards. So that on a morning when she awoke in high spirits she would raze the clothes closets, empty the trunks, tear apart the attics, and wage a war of separation against the piles of clothing that had been seen once too often, the hats she had never worn because there had been no occasion to wear them while they were still in fashion, the shoes copied by European artists from those used by empresses for their coronations, and which were scorned here by highborn ladies because they were identical to the ones that black women bought at the market to wear in the house. For the entire morning the interior terrace would be in a state of crisis, and in the house it would be difficult to breathe because of bitter gusts from the mothballs. But in a few hours order would be reestablished because she at last took pity on so much silk strewn on the floor, so many leftover brocades and useless pieces of passementerie, so many silver fox tails, all condemned to the fire.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在多次周游世界的旅行中，费尔明娜·达萨买回所有因新奇而引起她注意的东西。她想要得到它们都是因为一时的冲动，但丈夫却乐于为她的冲动找出合适的理由。这些东西摆在它们原来的环境中，都是美丽且有用的，比如在罗马、巴黎、伦敦的玻璃橱窗里，或是在正因查尔斯顿舞而抖动不止、一座座摩天大楼拔地而起的纽约的橱窗里。然而，它们经不起施特劳斯的圆舞曲、煎猪皮，以及在四十度的高温下找个阴凉处举行节日庆典的考验。她每次回来都带着五六个巨大的立式箱子，由上过漆的金属制成，锁和包角都是铜的，就像神话故事中的棺材。带回来的东西让她成为世界最新奇迹的代言人，可实际上，除了他们本地的圈中人看见这些东西的第一瞬间，其余时候，它们根本不值那高昂的价格。不过，它们本来也就是为了让别人看见一次才买的。她在步入老年之前很久，就已经意识到自己的公众形象不过是虚荣，因而常常能听见她在家里说：“得弄走这些破烂才行，都没有住的地方了。”乌尔比诺医生嘲笑她的这种想法徒劳无益，因为他知道，腾出的地方只会被重新填满。但是她坚持要这样做，因为多一件东西确实也放不下了，更何况所有地方没有一件东西是真正能派上点用场的，比如挂在门把手上的那些衬衫，还有压了又压才塞进厨房柜子的欧洲冬衣。于是，一天早晨，她情绪高涨地爬起床来，翻箱倒柜，把阁楼翻了个底朝天，发动了一场战争般的扫荡，清理了一堆堆过时已久的衣服、一顶顶在流行时都没有机会戴的帽子，以及欧洲设计师们依据女王们加冕时穿的式样设计的鞋子——它们在本地被那些门第高贵的小姐们鄙视，因为款式和黑女人从市场上买回来的居家便鞋一模一样。整个早上，内阳台一直处于一片忙乱之中，樟脑球散发出的一阵阵刺鼻气味让家里的人呼吸困难。但几小时后，家中又恢复了平静，因为她最终心软了，那么多的丝绸衣物被扔在地上，那么多的锦缎、废弃的金银丝带、蓝狐尾，竟通通要被扔进火堆。">查看中文翻译</div>

She would say: "Someone should invent something to do with things you cannot use anymore but that you still cannot throw out." That was true: she was dismayed by the voracity with which objects kept invading living spaces, displacing the humans, forcing them back into the corners, until Fermina Daza pushed the objects out of sight. For she was not as ordered as people thought, but she did have her own desperate method for appearing to be so: she hid the disorder.

<div class="line_en">Death's passage through the house brought the solution. Once she had burned her husband's clothes, Fermina Daza realized that her hand had not trembled, and on the same impulse she continued to light the fire at regular intervals, throwing everything on it, old and new, not thinking about the envy of the rich or the vengeance of the poor who were dying of hunger. Finally, she had the mango tree cut back at the roots until there was nothing left of that misfortune, and she gave the live parrot to the new Museum of the City. Only then did she draw a free breath in the kind of house she had always dreamed of: large, easy, and all hers.</div>

Fermina Daza's closest friends began to visit her once she had overcome the crisis of her mourning, they played cards facing the bare patio, they tried out new recipes, they brought her up to date on the secret life of the insatiable world that continued to exist without her. One of the most faithful was Lucrecia del Real del Obispo, an aristocrat of the old school who had always been a good friend and who drew even closer after the death of Juvenal Urbino. Stiff with arthritis and repenting her wayward life, in those days Lucrecia del Real not only provided her with the best company, she also consulted with her regarding the civic and secular projects that were being arranged in the city, and this made her feel useful for her own sake and not because of the protective shadow of her husband. And yet she was never so closely identified with him as she was then, for she was no longer called by her maiden name, and she became known as the Widow Urbino.</div>

<div class="line_en">Two days later she received a different kind of letter from him: handwritten on linen paper and his complete name inscribed with great clarity on the back of the envelope. It was the same ornate handwriting as in his earlier letters, the same will to lyricism, but applied to a simple paragraph of gratitude for the courtesy of her greeting in the Cathedral. For several days after she read the letter Fermina Daza continued to think about it with troubled memories, but with a conscience so clear that on the following Thursday she suddenly asked Lucrecia del Real del Obispo if she happened to know Florentino Ariza, the, owner of the riverboats. Lucrecia replied that she did: "He seems to be a wandering succubus." She repeated the common gossip that he had never had a woman although he was such a good catch, and that he had a secret office where he took the boys he pursued at night along the docks. Fermina Daza had heard that story for as long as she could remember, and she had never believed it or given it any importance. But when she heard it repeated with so much conviction by Lucrecia del Real del Obispo, who had also been rumored at one time to have strange tastes, she could not resist the urge to clarify matters. She said she had known Florentino Ariza since he was a boy. She reminded her that his mother had owned a notions shop on the Street of Windows and also bought old shirts and sheets, which she unraveled and sold as bandages during the civil wars. And she concluded with conviction: "He is an honorable man, and he is the soul of tact." She was so vehement that Lucrecia took back what she had said: "When all is said and done, they also say the same sort of thing about me." Fermina Daza was not curious enough to ask herself why she was making so passionate a defense of a man who had been no more than a shadow in her life. She continued to think about him, above all when the mail arrived without another letter from him. Two weeks of silence had gone by when one of the servant girls woke her during her siesta with a warning whisper:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两天以后，她收到一封他寄来的与往日截然不同的信，是手写的，用的是一张亚麻纸，信封背面清晰地署了寄信人的全名。和早年的那些信一样，同样的花体字，同样的情真意切，但内容就只有一段简短的感激之言，感谢费尔明娜·达萨在大教堂里对他与众不同的问候。读过之后的好几天里，费尔明娜·达萨都怀着一种躁动不断地想起这封信。她胸怀坦荡，于是，在接下来的那个星期四，她突兀地问起卢克雷西娅·德尔雷亚尔·德尔奥比斯波，问她是否凑巧认识弗洛伦蒂诺·阿里萨，内河航运公司的老板。卢克雷西娅回答说认识：“好像是个放荡的魔鬼。”她重复了那个流行的说法，说他从不结识女人，但为人很大方，还说他有一间秘密办公室，专为把夜晚在码头上弄到手的男孩带去。费尔明娜·达萨几乎自打有记忆以来就听到这种传言，她从来不信，也不放在心上。但她听到也曾一度被认为有些怪异嗜好的卢克雷西娅·德尔雷亚尔·德尔奥比斯波也言之凿凿地说起此事时，忍不住要即刻把事情解释清楚。她告诉她，自己从小就认识弗洛伦蒂诺·阿里萨。她还说，记得他的母亲在窗户街有一家杂货铺，除此之外，还在内战时期收购旧衬衫和床单，拆开后当作急救药棉出售。最后，她十分肯定地得出结论：“他是个正经人，全凭双手养活自己。”见她说得如此激动，卢克雷西娅收回了自己的话：“说到底，别人也是这样说我的。”费尔明娜·达萨并没有好奇地自问，为何她会如此热切地维护一个不过是她生活中的影子的男人。她继续想着他，特别是当邮差到来却没有带来他的新信时。就这样，无声无息地过了两个星期，直到这天，一个女佣用慌张的口吻小声地在她耳边把她从午睡中叫醒。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It seemed incredible, but as the first anniversary of her husband's death approached, Fermina Daza felt herself entering a place that was shady, cool, quiet: the grove of the irremediable. She was not yet aware, and would not be for several months, of how much the written meditations of Florentino Ariza had helped her to recover her peace of mind. Applied to her own experiences, they were what allowed her to understand her own life and to await the designs of old age with serenity. Their meeting at the memorial Mass was a providential opportunity for her to let Florentino Ariza know that she, too, thanks to his letters of encouragement, was prepared to erase the past.</div>

<div class="line_en">He was there. Fermina Daza's first reaction was panic. She thought no, he should come back another day at a more appropriate ho ur, she was in no condition to receive visitors, there was nothing to talk about. But she recovered instantly and told her to show him into the drawing room and bring him coffee, while she tidied herself before seeing him. Florentino Ariza had waited at the street door, burning under the infernal three o'clock sun, but in full control of the situation. He was prepared not to be received, even with an amiable excuse, and that certainty kept him calm. But the decisiveness of her message shook him to his very marrow, and when he walked into the cool shadows of the drawing room he did not have time to think about the miracle he was experiencing because his intestines suddenly filled in an explosion of painful foam. He sat down, holding his breath, hounded by the damnable memory of the bird droppings on his first love letter, and he remained motionless in the shadowy darkness until the first attack of shivering had passed, resolved to accept any mishap at that moment except this unjust misfortune.</div>

<div class="line_en">He knew himself well: despite his congenital constipation, his belly had betrayed him in public three or four times in the course of his many years, and those three or four times he had been obliged to give in. Only on those occasions, and on others of equal urgency, did he realize the truth of the words that he liked to repeat in jest: "I do not believe in God, but I am afraid of Him." He did not have time for doubts: he tried to say any prayer he could remember, but he could not think of a single one. When he was a boy, another boy had taught him magic words for hitting a bird with a stone: "Aim, aim, got my aim -- if I miss you I'm not to blame." He used it when he went to the country for the first time with a new slingshot, and the bird fell down dead. In a confused way he thought that one thing had something to do with the other, and he repeated the formula now with the fervor of a prayer, but it did not have the desired effect. A twisting in his guts like the coil of a spring lifted him from his seat, the foaming in his belly grew thicker and more painful, it grumbled a lament and left him covered with icy sweat. The maid who brought him the coffee was frightened by his corpse's face. He sighed: "It's the heat." She opened the window, thinking she would make him more comfortable, but the afternoon sun hit him full in the face and she had to close it again. He knew he could not hold out another moment, and then Fermina Daza came in, almost invisible in the darkness, dismayed at seeing him in such a state.</div>

Florentino Ariza thanked God for that on Friday, at five o'clock sharp, when the maid led him through the darkness of the drawing room to the terrace in the patio, where he saw Fermina Daza sitting beside a small table set for two. She offered him tea, chocolate, or coffee. Florentino Ariza asked for coffee, very hot and very strong, and she told the maid: "The usual for me." The usual was a strong infusion of different kinds of Oriental teas, which raised her spirits after her siesta. By the time she had emptied the teapot and he the coffeepot, they had both attempted and then broken off several topics of conversation, not so much because they were really interested in them but in order to avoid others that neither dared to broach. They were both intimidated, they could not understand what they were doing so far from their youth on a terrace with checkerboard tiles in a house that belonged to no one and that was still redolent of cemetery flowers. It was the first time in half a century that they had been so close and had enough time to look at each other with some serenity, and they had seen each other for what they were: two old people, ambushed by death, who had nothing in common except the memory of an ephemeral past that was no longer theirs but belonged to two young people who had vanished and who could have been their grandchildren. She thought that he would at last be convinced of the unreality of his dream, and that this would redeem his insolence.</div>

She did not know his reasons, and he would have been willing to sell his soul if he could have told them to her. She did not know the river either. Her husband had an aversion to the air of the Andes that he concealed with a variety of excuses: the dangers to the heart of the altitude, the risks of pneumonia, the duplicity of the people, the injustices of centralism. And so they knew half the world, but they did not know their own country. Nowadays there was a Junkers seaplane that flew from town to town along the basin of the Magdalena like an aluminum grasshopper, with two crew members, six passengers, and many sacks of mail. Florentino Ariza commented: "It is like a flying coffin." She had been on the first balloon flight and had experienced no fear, but she could hardly believe that she was the same person who had dared such an adventure. She said: "Things have changed."

<div class="line_en">At times the sound of airplanes took her by surprise. She had seen them flying very low and performing acrobatic maneuvers on the centenary of the death of The Liberator. One of them, as black as an enormous turkey buzzard, grazed the roofs of the houses in La Manga, left a piece of wing in a nearby tree, and was caught in the electrical wires. But not even that had convinced Fermina Daza of the existence of airplanes. In recent years she had not even had the curiosity to go to Manzanillo Bay, where seaplanes landed on the water after the police launches had warned away the fishermen's canoes and the growing numbers of recreational boats. Because of her age, she had been chosen to greet Charles Lindbergh with a bouquet of roses when he came here on his goodwill flight, and she could not understand how a man who was so tall, so blond, so handsome, could go up in a contraption that looked as if it were made of corrugated tin and that two mechanics had to push by the tail to help lift it off the ground. She just could not get it through her head that airplanes not much larger than that one could carry eight people. On the other hand, she had heard that the riverboats were a delight because they did not roll like ocean liners, although there were other, more serious dangers, such as sandbars and attacks by bandits.</div>

<div class="line_en">Florentino Ariza explained that those were all legends from another time: these days the riverboats had ballrooms and cabins as spacious and luxurious as hotel rooms, with private baths and electric fans, and there had been no armed attacks since the last civil war. He also explained, with the satisfaction of a personal triumph, that these advances were due more than anything else to the freedom of navigation that he had fought for and which had stimulated competition: instead of a single company, as in the past, there were now three, which were very active and prosperous. Nevertheless, the rapid progress of aviation was a real threat to all of them. She tried to console him: boats would always exist because there were not many people crazy enough to get into a contraption that seemed to go against nature.

He said that they were not letters in the strict sense of the word, but pages from a book that he would like to write. She, too, had understood them in that way. In fact, she had intended to return them, if he would not take that as an insult, so that they could be put to better use.

They finished their second cup in a silence furrowed by presentiments, and when she spoke again it was to ask a maid to bring her the folder of letters.

<div class="line_en">And so he returned on Tuesday at five o'clock, and then every Tuesday after that, and he ignored the convention of notifying her, because by the end of the second month the weekly visits had been incorporated into both their routines. Florentino Ariza brought English biscuits for tea, candied chestnuts, Greek olives, little salon delicacies that he would find on the ocean liners. One Tuesday he brought her a copy of the picture of her and Hildebranda taken by the Belgian photographer more than half a century before, which he had bought for fifteen centavos at a postcard sale in the Arcade of the Scribes. Fermina Daza could not understand how it had come to be there, and he could only understand it as a miracle of love. One morning, as he was cutting roses in his garden, Florentino Ariza could not resist the temptation of taking one to her on his next visit. It was a difficult problem in the language of flowers because she was a recent widow. A red rose, symbol of flaming passion, might offend her mourning. Yellow roses, which in another language were the flowers of good fortune, were an expression of jealousy in the common vocabulary. He had heard of the black roses of Turkey, which were perhaps the most appropriate, but he had not been able to obtain any for acclimatization in his patio. After much thought he risked a white rose, which he liked less than the others because it was insipid and mute: it did not say anything. At the last minute, in case Fermina Daza was suspicious enough to attribute some meaning to it, he removed the thorns.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是，星期二下午五点他又来了。并且，以后的每个星期二都例行如此，从不按惯例事先通知，因为到了第二个月的月末，每星期的见面已纳入了两人的日常习惯。弗洛伦蒂诺·阿里萨总是会带来喝茶时吃的英国饼干、糖渍栗子、希腊橄榄，以及远洋轮船上各种聚会时吃的精致美味。有一个星期二，他给她带来了她和伊尔德布兰达的照片，就是半个多世纪前比利时摄影师拍的那张，他在“代笔人门廊”的一次明信片拍卖中花了十五生太伏买下来。费尔明娜·达萨搞不明白照片怎么会到了那里，他也不明白，但他把这看作爱情的奇迹。一天早上，在花园中修剪玫瑰时，弗洛伦蒂诺·阿里萨禁不住诱惑，想在下次拜访时为费尔明娜·达萨带去一枝。但给新寡的女人送花，花语成了难题。红玫瑰象征着火一般的激情，对守丧的她来说可能是一种冒犯。而黄玫瑰呢，有时象征着好运，但更普遍的时候表达的是忌妒。他曾听人说起土耳其黑玫瑰，或许那是最合适的，但他一直没能让它们适应自己院子里的气候。想来想去，他决定冒险带一枝白玫瑰，他从不像喜欢其他玫瑰那样喜欢它，就因为它平淡无奇，无声无息：什么也不能表达。在最后时刻，为避免精明的费尔明娜·达萨赋予它什么含义，他剪掉了玫瑰上的刺。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">That is how it always was: he would attempt to move forward, and she would block the way. But on this occasion, despite her ready answer, Florentino Ariza realized that he had hit the mark, because she had to turn her face so that he would not see her blush. A burning, childish blush, with a life of its own and an insolence that turned her vexation on herself. Florentino Ariza was very careful to move to other, less offensive topics, but his courtesy was so obvious that she knew she had been found out, and that increased her anger. It was an evil Tuesday. She was on the point of asking him not to return, but the idea of a lovers" quarrel seemed so ridiculous at their age and in their circumstances that it provoked a fit of laughter. The following Tuesday, when Florentino Ariza was placing the rose in the vase, she examined her conscience and discovered to her joy that not a vestige of resentment was left over from the previous week.</div>

Florentino Ariza did not know how to play, but Fermina taught him in just one visit and they both sent a written challenge to the Urbino Dazas for the following Tuesday. The games were so pleasant for everyone that they soon became as official as his visits, and patterns were established for each person's contribution. Dr. Urbino and his wife, who was an excellent confectioner, brought exquisite pastries, a different one each time. Florentino Ariza continued to bring delicacies from the European ships, and Fermina Daza found a way to contribute a new surprise each time. They played on the third Tuesday of every month, and although they did not wager with money, the loser was obliged to contribute something special to the next game.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这种拜访很快便尴尬地扩展到家庭范围，因为乌尔比诺·达萨医生和他的妻子常常意外地出现，而且还会留下来玩纸牌。弗洛伦蒂诺·阿里萨本来不会玩牌，费尔明娜·达萨在某次见面时教会了他，于是两人给乌尔比诺·达萨夫妇发出了下星期二一决高下的书面挑战。那几局牌大家都玩得很愉快，很快，牌局便像拜访一样被正式确定下来，并规定好每人需为此做出的贡献。乌尔比诺·达萨医生一家贡献出每次都不一样的别出心裁的蛋糕，因为他的妻子可以称得上是一位杰出的糕点师。弗洛伦蒂诺·阿里萨继续带来在欧洲船上找到的新奇玩意儿。费尔明娜·达萨则每星期都绞尽脑汁搞出些令人惊喜的花样。纸牌比赛在每个月的第三个星期二举行，赌注并不是钱，而是输者必须在下一次的牌局中做出点特别的贡献。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was no difference between Dr. Urbino Daza and his public image: his talents were limited, his manner awkward, and he suffered from sudden twitching, caused by either happiness or annoyance, and from inopportune blushing, which made one fear for his mental fortitude. But it was evident on first meeting him that he was, beyond the shadow of a doubt, what Florentino Ariza most feared people would call him: a good man. His wife, on the other hand, was vivacious and had a plebeian spark of sharp wit that gave a more human note to her elegance. One could not wish for a better couple to play cards with, and Florentino Ariza's insatiable need for love overflowed with the illusion of feeling that he was part of a family.</div>

It was an exquisite dish served with a poisonous wine: the Social Club reserved the right to refuse admission for any number of reasons, and one of the most important was illegitimate birth. Uncle Leo XII had experienced great annoyance in this regard, and Florentino Ariza himself had suffered the humiliation of being asked to leave when he was already sitting at the table as the guest of one of the founding members, for whom Florentino Ariza had performed complex favors in the area of river commerce, and who had no other choice but to take him elsewhere to eat.</div>

<div class="line_en">Nevertheless Florentino Ariza took the risk with Dr. Urbino Daza, and he was welcomed with special deference, although he was not asked to sign the gold book for notable guests. The lunch was brief, there were just the two of them, and its tone was subdued. The fears regarding the meeting that had troubled Florentino Ariza since the previous afternoon vanished with the port he had as an aperitif. Dr. Urbino Daza wanted to talk to him about his mother. Because of everything that he said, Florentino Ariza realized that she had spoken to her son about him. And something still more surprising: she had lied on his behalf. She told him that they had been childhood friends, playmates from the time of her arrival from San Juan de la Ciénaga, and that he had introduced her to reading, for which she was forever grateful. She also told him that after school she had often spent long hours in the notions shop with Tránsito Ariza, performing prodigious feats of embroidery, for she had been a notable teacher, and that if she had not continued seeing Florentino Ariza with the same frequency, it had not been through choice but because of how their lives had diverged.</div>

<div class="line_en">Before he came to the heart of his intentions, Dr. Urbino Daza made several digressions on the subject of aging. He thought that the world would make more rapid progress without the burden of old people. He said: "Humanity, like armies in the field, advances at the speed of the slowest." He foresaw a more humanitarian and by the same token a more civilized future in which men and women would be isolated in marginal cities when they could no longer take care of themselves so that they might be spared the humiliation, suffering, and frightful loneliness of old age. From the medical point of view, according to him, the proper age limit would be seventy. But until they reached that degree of charity, the only solution was nursing homes, where the old could console each other and share their likes and dislikes, their habits and sorrows, safe from their natural disagreements with the younger generation. He said: "Old people, with other old people, are not so old." Well, then: Dr. Urbino Daza wanted to thank Florentino Ariza for the good companionship he gave his mother in the solitude of her widowhood, he begged him to continue doing so for the good of them both and the convenience of all, and to have patience with her senile whims. Florentino Ariza was relieved with the outcome of their interview. "Don't worry," he said. "I am now four years older than she is, and have been since long, long before you were born." Then he succumbed to the temptation of giving vent to his feelings with an ironic barb.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在没有深入谈到自己的意图之前，乌尔比诺·达萨医生先信口开河地谈论了一番对老年的看法。他认为，如果没有老人阻碍，世界会发展得更快。他说：“人类，就如同远征的军队一样，是以队伍中步伐最慢者的速度前进的。”他预见将会有一个更人道，从而也更文明的未来，那时，人到了不能自我料理的年龄，都将被隔离到边远城市，以避免老年的耻辱、痛苦和可怕的孤独。从医生的角度来看，他认为界限应该是六十岁。但在社会达到那样一个仁慈的高度之前，唯一的解决办法就是养老院。在那里，老人们可以互相安慰，分享自己的好恶、怪癖和痛苦，并逃开与下几代人不可避免的分歧。他说：“老人在老人们中间，就显得没那么老了。”因而，他很想感谢弗洛伦蒂诺·阿里萨在他母亲孤独的寡妇生活中，很好地陪伴了她，并恳求他为了他们两人好，也为了让所有人都舒心，继续这样做下去，另外，他还请他对母亲上了年纪后的坏脾气抱有耐心。这次会面的结果令弗洛伦蒂诺·阿里萨感到如释重负。“请您放心，”他说，“我比她大四岁，而且不只现在如此，从很久以前，在您出生很久以前就是如此了。”接着，他忍不住用隐晦的讥讽一吐为快。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Until that moment Dr. Urbino Daza had not noticed the inappropriateness of his prognostications, and he became enmeshed in a long series of explanations that only made matters worse. But Florentino Ariza helped him to extricate himself. He was radiant, for he knew that sooner or later he was going to have another meeting like this one with Dr. Urbino Daza in order to satisfy an unavoidable social convention: the formal request for his mother's hand in marriage. The lunch had been very encouraging, not only in and of itself but because it showed him how simple and well received that inexorable request was going to be.

<div class="line_en">Even in his youth Florentino Ariza climbed up and down stairs with special care, for he had always believed that old age began with one's first minor fall and that death came with the second. The staircase in his offices seemed the most dangerous of all to him because it was so steep and narrow, and long before he had to make a special effort not to drag his feet, he would climb it with his eyes fixed on each step and both hands clutching the banister. It had often been suggested that he replace it with one that was less dangerous, but he always put off the decision until next month because he thought it was a concession to old age. As the years passed, it took him longer and longer to walk up the stairs, not because it was harder for him, as he himself hurried to explain, but because he used greater and greater care in the climb. Nevertheless, on the afternoon when he returned from lunch with Dr. Urbino Daza, after the aperitif of port and half a glass of red wine with the meal, and above all after their triumphal conversation, he tried to reach the third stair with so youthful a dance step that he twisted his left ankle, fell backward, and only by a miracle did not kill himself. As he was falling he had enough lucidity to think that he was not going to die of this accident because the logic of life would not allow two men, who had loved the same woman so much for so many years, to die in the same way within a year of each other. He was right. He was put into a plaster cast from his foot to his calf and forced to remain immobile in bed, but he was livelier than he had been before his fall. When the doctor ordered sixty days of convalescence, he could not believe his misfortune.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="还年轻时，弗洛伦蒂诺·阿里萨上下楼梯就特别小心，因为他知道老年常常是在一次无关紧要的摔倒之后开始的，而死神则跟随着第二次跌倒到来。在所有楼梯里，他觉得办公室的楼梯最危险，因为它又陡又窄。而且，早在他还不太费力就能不拖着双脚上楼之前很久，他便在每次上楼时双眼紧盯台阶，双手紧扶栏杆。大家曾多次建议他换一个不那么危险的楼梯，但他总是推说下个月再做决定，因为在他看来，这是向衰老让步的表现。随着岁月的流逝，他上楼需要的时间越来越长，但并非像他匆忙解释的那样，是因为越来越吃力，而是因为越来越小心。然而，在跟乌尔比诺·达萨医生共进午餐后回来的那天下午，由于喝了一杯波尔多开胃酒和半杯佐餐红葡萄酒，尤其是又进行了那么鼓舞人心的对话，他试图以年轻人的舞步一下跃上第三级台阶，结果扭伤了左脚脚踝，仰面朝天地跌下来，没有摔死已属奇迹。在摔倒的那一瞬，他头脑十分清醒地想，他不会跌一跤就死掉，因为在生活的逻辑中，两个在这么多年以来一直深爱着同一个女人的男人，不可能前后只隔一年就以同样的方式死掉。他是对的。他从脚一直到小腿都被打上了石膏，并被迫卧床静养，但人却比摔倒之前还要精神。当医生命令他六十天不许走动时，他无法相信自己竟会如此不幸。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The first Monday was his worst day. The pain had eased and the medical prognosis was very encouraging, but he refused to accept the fatality of not seeing Fermina Daza the following afternoon for the first time in four months. Nevertheless, after a resigned siesta, he submitted to reality and wrote her a note excusing himself. He wrote it by hand on perfumed paper and in luminous ink so that it could be read in the dark, and with no sense of shame he dramatized the gravity of his accident in an effort to arouse her compassion. She answered him two days later, very sympathetic, very kind, without one word extra, just as in the great days of their love. He seized the opportunity as it flew by and wrote to her again. When she answered a second time, he decided to go much further than in their coded Tuesday conversations, and he had a telephone installed next to his bed on the pretext of keeping an eye on the company's daily affairs. He asked the operator to connect him with the three-digit number that he had known by heart since the first time he dialed it. The quiet voice strained by the mystery of distance, the beloved voice answered, recognized the other voice, and said goodbye after three conventional phrases of greeting. Florentino Ariza was devastated by her indifference: they were back at the beginning.</div>

<div class="line_en">Two days later, however, he received a letter from Fermina Daza in which she begged him not to call again. Her reasons were valid. There were so few telephones in the city that all communication took place through an operator who knew all the subscribers, their lives, their miracles, and it did not matter if they were not at home: she would find them wherever they might be. In return for such efficiency she kept herself informed of their conversations, she uncovered the secrets, the best-kept dramas of their private lives, and it was not unusual for her to interrupt a conversation in order to express her point of view or to calm tempers. Then, too, that year marked the founding of Justice, an evening newspaper whose sole purpose was to attack the families with long last names, inherited and unencumbered names, which was the publisher's revenge because his sons had not been admitted to the Social Club. Despite her unimpeachable life, Fermina Daza was more careful now than ever of everything she said or did, even with her closest friends. So that she maintained her connection to Florentino Ariza by means of the anachronistic thread of letters. The correspondence back and forth became so frequent and intense that he forgot about his leg and the chastisement of the bed, he forgot about everything, and he dedicated himself totally to writing on the kind of portable table used in hospitals to serve meals to patients.</div>

<div class="line_en">They called each other tú again, again they exchanged commentaries on their lives as they had done once before in their letters, and again Florentino Ariza tried to move too quickly: he wrote her name with the point of a pin on the petals of a camellia and sent it to her in a letter. Two days later it was returned with no message. Fermina Daza could not help it: all that seemed like children's games to her, most of all when Florentino Ariza insisted on evoking the afternoons of melancholy verses in the Park of the Evangels, the letters hidden along her route to school, the embroidery lessons under the almond trees. With sorrowing heart she reprimanded him in what appeared to be a casual question in the midst of other trivial remarks: "Why do you insist on talking about what does not exist?" Later she reproached him for his fruitless insistence on not permitting himself to grow old in a natural way. This was, according to her, the reason for his haste and constant blundering as he evoked the past. She could not understand how a man capable of the thoughts that had given her the strength to endure her widowhood could become entangled in so childish a manner when he attempted to apply them to his own life. Their roles were reversed. Now it was she who tried to give him new courage to face the future, with a phrase that he, in his reckless haste, could not decipher: Let time pass and we will see what it brings. For he was never as good a student as she was. His forced immobility, the growing lucidity of his conviction that time was fleeting, his mad desire to see her, everything proved to him that his fear of falling had been more accurate and more tragic than he had foreseen. For the first time, he began to think in a reasoned way about the reality of death.</div>

On Saturdays and Sundays she was relieved by América Vicuña, who was to receive her teaching degree in December of that year. He had promised to send her to Alabama for further study, at the expense of the river company, in part to quiet his conscience and above all in order not to face either the reproaches that she did not know how to make to him or the explanations that he owed to her. He never imagined how much she suffered during her sleepless nights at school, during the weekends without him, during her life without him, because he never imagined how much she loved him. He had been informed in an official letter from the school that she had fallen from her perpetual first place in the class to last, and that she had almost failed her final examinations. But he ignored his duty as guardian: he said nothing to América Vicuña's parents, restrained by a sense of guilt that he tried to elude, and he did not discuss it with her because of a well-founded fear that she would try to implicate him in her failure.

<div class="line_en">The two women who took care of him, and Florentino Ariza himself, were surprised at how much he had changed. Less than ten years before, he had assaulted one of the maids behind the main staircase in the house, dressed and standing as she was, and in less time than a Filipino rooster he had left her in a family way. He had to give her a furnished house in exchange for her swearing that the author of her dishonor was a part-time, Sunday sweetheart who had never even kissed her, and her father and uncles, who were proficient sugarcane cutters, forced them to marry. It did not seem possible that this could be the same man, this man handled front and back by two women who just a few months earlier had made him tremble with love and who now soaped him above his waist and below, dried him with towels of Egyptian cotton, and massaged his entire body, while he did not emit a single sigh of passion. Each of them had a different explanation for his lack of desire. Leona Cassiani thought it was the prelude to death. América Vicuña attributed it to a hidden cause whose intricacies she could not decipher. He alone knew the truth, and it had its own name.

Lucrecia del Real del Obispo had gone to Panama to have her ear examined because of a pain that nothing could ease, and after a month she came back feeling much better, but hearing less than she had before and using an ear trumpet. Fermina Daza was the friend who was most tolerant of her confusions of questions and answers, and this was so encouraging to Lucrecia that hardly a day went by that she did not stop in at any hour.

In the gloom of her mourning she had resolved not to use it again, for a widow bearing her family names could not listen to any kind of music without offending the memory of the dead, even if she did so in private. But after her third solitary Tuesday she had it brought back to the drawing room, not to enjoy the sentimental song on the Riobamba station, as she had done before, but to fill her idle hours with the soap operas from Santiago de Cuba. It was a good idea, for after the birth of her daughter she had begun to lose the habit of reading that her husband had inculcated with so much diligence ever since their honeymoon, and with the progressive fatigue of her eyes she had stopped altogether, so that months would go by without her knowing where she had left her reading glasses.</div>

From time to time she listened to the news to find out what was going on in the world, and on the few occasions when she was alone in the house she would turn the volume very low and listen to distant, clear merengues from Santo Domingo and plenas from Puerto Rico.

The effect on her was even more devastating when Lucrecia del Real told her the complete story, which had been published in a local newspaper. The police had discovered that the elderly couple beaten to death were clandestine lovers who had taken their vacations together for forty years, but who each had a stable and happy marriage as well as very large families.

<div class="line_en">These were not the last tears that Fermina Daza was going to hold back. Florentino Ariza had not yet finished his sixty days of seclusion when Justice published a front-page story, complete with photographs of the two protagonists, about the alleged secret love affair between Dr. Juvenal Urbino and Lucrecia del Real del Obispo. There was speculation on the details of their relationship, the frequency of their meetings and how they were arranged, and the complicity of her husband, who was given to excesses of sodomy with the blacks on his sugar plantation. The story, published in enormous block letters in an ink the color of blood, fell like a thundering cataclysm on the enfeebled local aristocracy. Not a line of it was true: Juvenal Urbino and Lucrecia del Real had been close friends in the days when they were both single, and they had continued their friendship after their marriages, but they had never been lovers. In any case, it did not seem that the purpose of the story was to sully the name of Dr. Juvenal Urbino, whose memory enjoyed universal respect, but to injure the husband of Lucrecia del Real, who had been elected President of the Social Club the week before. The scandalous story was suppressed in a few hours. But Lucrecia del Real did not visit Fermina Daza again, and Fermina Daza interpreted this as a confession of guilt.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was soon obvious, however, that Fermina Daza was not immune to the hazards of her class. Justice attacked her one weak flank: her father's business. When he was forced into exile, she knew of only one instance of his shady dealings, which had been told to her by Gala Placidia. Later, when Dr. Urbino confirmed the story after his interview with the Governor, she was convinced that her father had been the victim of slander. The facts were that two government agents had come to the house on the Park of the Evangels with a warrant, searched it from top to bottom without finding what they were looking for, and at last ordered the wardrobe with the mirrored doors in Fermina Daza's old bedroom to be opened. Gala Placidia, who was alone in the house and lacked the means to stop anyone from doing anything, refused to open it, with the excuse that she did not have the keys. Then one of the agents broke the mirror on the door with the butt of his revolver and found the space between the glass and the wood stuffed with counterfeit hundred-dollar bills. This was the last in a chain of clues that led to Lorenzo Daza as the final link in a vast international operation. It was a masterful fraud, for the bills had the watermarks of the original paper: one-dollar bills had been erased by a chemical process that seemed to be magic, and reprinted as hundred-dollar notes. Lorenzo Daza claimed that the wardrobe had been purchased long after his daughter's wedding, and that it must have come into the house with the bills already in it, but the police proved that it had been there since the days when Fermina Daza had been in school. He was the only one who could have hidden the counterfeit fortune behind the mirrors. This was all Dr. Urbino told his wife when he promised the Governor that he would send his father-in-law back to his own country in order to cover up the scandal. But the newspaper told much more.</div>

<div class="line_en">Justice also said that at the time that General Rafael Reyes founded the navy, Lorenzo Daza bought a shipment of surplus boots at a very low price from the English army, and with that one deal he doubled his fortune in six months. According to the newspaper, when the shipment reached this port, Lorenzo Daza refused to accept it because it contained only boots for the right foot, but he was the sole bidder when Customs auctioned it according to the law, and he bought it for the token sum of one hundred pesos. At the same time, under similar circumstances, an accomplice purchased the shipment of boots for the left foot that had reached Riohacha. Once they were in pairs, Lorenzo Daza took advantage of his relationship by marriage to the Urbino de la Calle family and sold the boots to the new navy at a profit of two thousand percent.</div>

Korzeniowski, who later became famous as Joseph Conrad, made contact somehow with Lorenzo Daza, who bought the shipment of arms from him on behalf of the government, with his credentials and his receipts in order and the purchase price in gold. According to the story in the newspaper, Lorenzo Daza claimed that the arms had been stolen in an improbable raid, and then he sold them again, for twice their value, to the Conservatives who were at war with the government.</div>

<div class="line_en">The story in Justice concluded by saying that Lorenzo Daza did not leave San Juan de la Ciénaga at the end of the last century in search of better opportunities for his daughter's future, as he liked to say, but because he had been found out in his prosperous business of adulterating imported tobacco with shredded paper, which he did with so much skill that not even the most sophisticated smokers noticed the deception. They also uncovered his links to a clandestine international enterprise whose most profitable business at the end of the last century had been the illegal smuggling of Chinese from Panama.

<div class="line_en">When Florentino Ariza left his bed, with his back on fire and carrying a walking stick for the first time instead of his umbrella, his first excursion was to Fermina Daza's house. She was like a stranger, ravaged by age, whose resentment had destroyed her desire to live. Dr. Urbino Daza, in the two visits he had made to Florentino Ariza during his exile, had spoken to him of how disturbed his mother was by the two stories in Justice. The first provoked her to such irrational anger at her husband's infidelity and her friend's disloyalty that she renounced the custom of visiting the family mausoleum one Sunday each month, for it infuriated her that he, inside his coffin, could not hear the insults she wanted to shout at him: she had a quarrel with a dead man. She let Lucrecia del Real know, through anyone who would repeat it to her, that she should take comfort in having had at least one real man in the crowd of people who had passed through her bed. As for the story about Lorenzo Daza, there was no way to know which affected her more, the story itself or her belated discovery of her father's true character. But one or the other, or both, had annihilated her. Her hair, the color of stainless steel, had ennobled her face, but now it looked like ragged yellow strands of corn silk, and her beautiful panther eyes did not recover their old sparkle even in the brilliant heat of her anger. Her decision not to go on living was evident in every gesture. She had long ago given up smoking, whether locked in the bathroom or anywhere else, but she took it up again, for the first time in public, and with an uncontrolled voracity, at first with cigarettes she rolled herself, as she had always liked to do, and then with ordinary ones sold in stores because she no longer had time or patience to do it herself. Anyone else would have asked himself what the future could hold for a lame old man whose back burned with a burro's saddle sores and a woman who longed for no other happiness but death. But not Florentino Ariza. He found a glimmer of hope in the ruins of disaster, for it seemed to him that Fermina Daza's misfortune glorified her, that her anger beautified her, and that her rancor with the world had given her back the untamed character she had displayed at the age of twenty.</div>

<div class="line_en">She had new reasons for being grateful to Florentino Ariza, because in response to the infamous stories, he had written Justice an exemplary letter concerning the ethical responsibilities of the press and respect for other people's honor. They did not publish it, but the author sent a copy to the Commercial Daily, the oldest and most serious newspaper along the Caribbean coast, which featured the letter on the front page. Signed with the pseudonym "Jupiter," it was so reasoned, incisive, and well written that it was attributed to some of the most notable writers in the province. It was a lone voice in the middle of the ocean, but it was heard at great depth and great distance. Fermina Daza knew who the author was without having to be told, because she recognized some of the ideas and even a sentence taken directly from Florentino Ariza's moral reflections. And so she received him with renewed affection in the disarray of her solitude. It was at this time that América Vicuña found herself alone one Saturday afternoon in the bedroom on the Street of Windows, and without looking for them, by sheer accident, she found the typed copies of the meditations of Florentino Ariza and the handwritten letters of Fermina Daza, in a wardrobe without a key.</div>

But Ofelia, his sister, came from New Orleans on the first fruit boat as soon as she heard that Fermina Daza had a strange friendship with a man whose moral qualifications were not the best. Her alarm grew to critical proportions during the first week, when she became aware of the familiarity and self-possession with which Florentino Ariza came into the house, and the whispers and fleeting lovers" quarrels that filled their visits until all hours of the night. What for Dr. Urbino Daza was a healthy affection between two lonely old people was for her a vice-ridden form of secret concubinage. Ofelia Urbino had always been like that, resembling Doña Blanca, her paternal grand mother, more than if she had been her daughter. Like her she was distinguished, like her she was arrogant, and like her she lived at the mercy of her prejudices. Even at the age of five she had been incapable of imagining an innocent friendship between a man and a woman, least of all when they were eighty years old. In a bitter argument with her brother, she said that all Florentino Ariza needed to do to complete his consolation of their mother was to climb into her widow's bed. Dr. Urbino Daza did not have the courage to face her, he had never had the courage to face her, but his wife intervened with a serene justification of love at any age. Ofelia lost her temper.</div>

With one more day of traveling by train she could visit the national capital, which they, like most Caribbeans of their generation, still called by the name it bore until the last century: Santa Fe. But she maintained the prejudices of her husband, and she did not want to visit a cold, dismal city where the women did not leave their houses except to attend five o'clock Mass and where, she had been told, they could not enter ice cream parlors or public offices, and where the funerals disrupted traffic at all hours of the day or night, and where it had been drizzling since the year one: worse than in Paris. On the other hand, she felt a very strong attraction to the river, she wanted to see the alligators sunning themselves on the sandy banks, she wanted to be awakened in the middle of the night by the woman's cry of the manatees, but the idea of so arduous a journey at her age, and a lone widow besides, seemed unrealistic to her.</div>

<div class="line_en">Florentino Ariza repeated the invitation later on, when she had decided to go on living without her husband, and then it had seemed more plausible. But after her quarrel with her daughter, embittered by the insults to her father, by her rancor toward her dead husband, by her anger at the hypocritical duplicities of Lucrecia del Real, whom she had considered her best friend for so many years, she felt herself superfluous in her own house. One afternoon, while she was drinking her infusion of worldwide leaves, she looked toward the morass of the patio where the tree of her misfortune would never bloom again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="后来，当她决心没有丈夫也要继续活下去时，弗洛伦蒂诺·阿里萨又重提了他的邀请，她觉得可能性似乎大了一些。再后来，由于跟女儿大吵一架，再加上父亲所受的侮辱、对死去丈夫的怨恨，以及对卢克雷西娅·德尔雷亚尔虚伪恭维的愤怒——多年来，她一直视她为最好的朋友——这一切都让她痛心不已，她甚至觉得自己在家里已是个多余的人。一天下午，她喝着那种用世界各地的叶子泡出的荼，望了一眼院中的泥塘，那棵带给她不幸的树再也不会长出新芽了。">查看中文翻译</div>

Her son and daughter-in-law were delighted when they heard the news. Florentino Ariza hastened to point out that on his vessels Fermina Daza would be a guest of honor, she would have a cabin to herself which would be just like home, she would enjoy perfect service, and the Captain himself would attend to her safety and well-being. He brought route maps to encourage her, picture postcards of furious sunsets, poems to the primitive paradise of the Magdalena written by illustrious travelers and by those who had become travelers by virtue of the poems. She would glance at them when she was in the mood.</div>

<div class="line_en">In January 1824, Commodore Johann Bernard Elbers, the father of river navigation, had registered the first steamboat to sail the Magdalena River, a primitive old forty-horsepower wreck named Fidelity. More than a century later, one seventh of July at six o'clock in the evening, Dr. Urbino Daza and his wife accompanied Fermina Daza as she boarded the boat that was to carry her on her first river voyage. It was the first vessel built in the local shipyards and had been christened New Fidelity in memory of its glorious ancestor. Fermina Daza could never believe that so significant a name for them both was indeed a historical coincidence and not another conceit born of Florentino Ariza's chronic romanticism.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一八二四年一月，海军准将、内河航运的创始人胡安·贝尔纳多·埃尔勃斯，注册了第一艘在马格达莱纳河上航行的蒸汽轮船，那是一艘四十马力的原始家伙，取名“忠诚号”。而一个多世纪以后，某个七月七日的下午六点钟，乌尔比诺·达萨医生和妻子陪伴着费尔明娜·达萨登上了将载她进行第一次河上旅行的航船。这是当地船厂造出的第一艘轮船，弗洛伦蒂诺·阿里萨为纪念光荣的前辈，将它命名为“新忠诚号”。费尔明娜·达萨永远也无法相信，这个对他们来说如此意味深长的名字的确是历史的巧合，而非弗洛伦蒂诺·阿里萨那旷日持久的浪漫主义的又一个花样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When in fact the day arrived, she took possession of the Presidential Suite as its lady and mistress. The ship's Captain honored Dr. Urbino Daza and his wife, and Florentino Ariza, with champagne and smoked salmon. His name was Diego Samaritano, he wore a white linen uniform that was absolutely correct, from the tips of his boots to his cap with the R. C. C. insignia embroidered in gold thread, and he possessed, in common with other river captains, the stoutness of a ceiba tree, a peremptory voice, and the manners of a Florentine cardinal.</div>

<div class="line_en">In any case, unlike the other riverboats, ancient and modem, New Fidelity boasted a suite next to the Captain's quarters that was spacious and comfortable: a sitting room with bamboo furniture covered in festive colors, a double bedroom decorated in Chinese motifs, a bathroom with tub and shower, a large, enclosed observation deck with hanging ferns and an unobstructed view toward the front and both sides of the boat, and a silent cooling system that kept out external noises and maintained a climate of perpetual spring. These deluxe accommodations, known as the Presidential Suite because three Presidents of the Republic had already made the trip in them, had no commercial purpose but were reserved for high-ranking officials and very special guests. Florentino Ariza had ordered the suite built for that public purpose as soon as he was named President of the R. C. C., but his private conviction was that sooner or later it was going to be the joyous refuge of his wedding trip with Fermina Daza.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不管怎样，与其他老式与现代的内河船都不同，“新忠诚号”在船长室旁设有一个宽敞舒适的加舱，包含一间摆着色彩喜庆的竹制家具的客厅，一间全部用中国图案装饰的双人卧室，一个同时装了浴缸和淋浴设施的卫生间，一个十分宽阔的吊着蕨类植物的封闭瞭望台（从那里可以完整地看到船的前方和两侧），还有一套安静的制冷系统，使整个环境免受外界的干扰，而且始终保持春天的气候。这套豪华的舱室被称为“总统舱”，因为到那时为止，已有三位共和国总统在此度过航程。它并不用于商业目的，而是留给高级官员和一些极为特殊的客人使用的。弗洛伦蒂诺·阿里萨刚被任命为CFC的董事长，就以树立公共形象为由，下令建造这个舱室，但他内心确信，迟早有一天，这里会成为他和费尔明娜·达萨新婚旅行中幸福的世外桃源。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At seven o'clock the first departure warning was sounded, and Fermina Daza felt it resonate with a sharp pain in her left ear. The night before, her dreams had been furrowed with evil omens that she did not dare to decipher. Very early in the morning she had ordered the car to take her to the nearby seminary burial ground, which in those days was called La Manga Cemetery, and as she stood in front of his crypt, she made peace with her dead husband in a monologue in which she freely recounted all the just recriminations she had choked back. Then she told him the details of the trip and said goodbye for now. She refused to tell anyone anything except that she was going away, which is what she had done whenever she had gone to Europe, in order to avoid exhausting farewells. Despite all her travels, she felt as if this were her first trip, and as the day approached her agitation increased. Once she was on board she felt abandoned and sad, and she wanted to be alone to cry.</div>

But to Dr. Urbino Daza this did not seem sufficient proof of innocence. He glanced at his wife in consternation, with the eyes of a drowning man looking for support, but her eyes were ice. She said in a very low, harsh voice: "You too?" Yes: he too, like his sister Ofelia, thought there was an age at which love began to be indecent.

<div class="line_en">It was a splendid evening, which Captain Diego Samaritano seasoned with succulent tales of his forty years on the river, but Fermina Daza had to make an enormous effort to appear amused. Despite the fact that the final warning had been sounded at eight o'clock, when visitors had been obliged to leave and the gangplank had been raised, the boat did not set sail until the Captain had finished eating and gone up to the bridge to direct the operation. Fermina Daza and Florentino Ariza stayed at the railing, surrounded by noisy passengers who made bets on how well they could identify the lights in the city, until the boat sailed out of the bay, moved along invisible channels and through swamps spattered with the undulating lights of the fishermen, and at last took a deep breath in the open air of the Great Magdalena River. Then the band burst into a popular tune, there was a joyous stampede of passengers, and in a mad rush, the dancing began.</div>

<div class="line_en">Fermina Daza preferred to take refuge in her cabin. She had not said a word for the entire evening, and Florentino Ariza allowed her to remain lost in her thoughts. He interrupted her only to say good night outside her cabin, but she was not tired, just a little chilly, and she suggested that they sit for a while on her private deck to watch the river. Florentino Ariza wheeled two wicker easy chairs to the railing, turned off the lights, placed a woolen shawl around her shoulders, and sat down beside her. With surprising skill, she rolled a cigarette from the little box of tobacco that he had brought her. She smoked it slowly, with the lit end inside her mouth, not speaking, and then she rolled another two and smoked them one right after the other. Sip by sip, Florentino Ariza drank two thermoses of mountain coffee.</div>

<div class="line_en">The lights of the city had disappeared over the horizon. Seen from the darkened deck in the light of a full moon, the smooth, silent river and the pastureland on either bank became a phosphorescent plain. From time to time one could see a straw hut next to the great bonfires signaling that wood for the ships" boilers was on sale. Florentino Ariza still had dim memories of the journey of his youth, and in dazzling flashes of lightning the sight of the river called them back to life as if they had happened yesterday. He recounted some of them to Fermina Daza in the belief that this might animate her, but she sat smoking in another world. Florentino Ariza renounced his memories and left her alone with hers, and in the meantime he rolled cigarettes and passed them to her already lit, until the box was empty. The music stopped after midnight, the voices of the passengers dispersed and broke into sleepy whispers, and two hearts, alone in the shadows on the deck, were beating in time to the breathing of the ship.</div>

<div class="line_en">Fermina Daza stopped smoking in order not to let go of the hand that was still in hers. She was lost in her longing to understand. She could not conceive of a husband better than hers had been, and yet when she recalled their life she found more difficulties than pleasures, too many mutual misunderstandings, useless arguments, unresolved angers. Suddenly she sighed: "It is incredible how one can be happy for so many years in the midst of so many squabbles, so many problems, damn it, and not really know if it was love or not." By the time she finished unburdening herself, someone had turned off the moon. The boat moved ahead at its steady pace, one foot in front of the other: an immense, watchful animal. Fermina Daza had returned from her longing.</div>

She began to speak of her dead husband in the present tense, as if he were alive, and Florentino Ariza knew then that for her, too, the time had come to ask herself with dignity, with majesty, with an irrepressible desire to live, what she should do with the love that had been left behind without a master.</div>

"We men are the miserable slaves of prejudice," he had once said to her. "But when a woman decides to sleep with a man, there is no wall she will not scale, no fortress she will not destroy, no moral consideration she will not ignore at its very root: there is no God worth worrying about." Fermina Daza sat motionless until dawn, thinking about Florentino Ariza, not as the desolate sentinel in the little Park of the Evangels, whose memory did not awaken even a spark of nostalgia in her, but as he was now, old and lame, but real: the man who had always been within reach and whom she could never acknowledge.

<div class="line_en">He did. Fermina Daza instructed the steward to let her sleep as long as she wanted, and when she awoke there was a vase on the night table with a fresh white rose, drops of dew still on it, as well as a letter from Florentino Ariza with as many pages as he had written since his farewell to her. It was a calm letter that did not attempt to do more than express the state of mind that had held him captive since the previous night: it was as lyrical as the others, as rhetorical as all of them, but it had a foundation in reality. Fermina Daza read it with some embarrassment because of the shameless racing of her heart. It concluded with the request that she advise the steward when she was ready, for the Captain was waiting on the bridge to show them the operation of the ship.</div>

<div class="line_en">She was ready at eleven o'clock, bathed and smelling of flower-scented soap, wearing a very simple widow's dress of gray etamine, and completely recovered from the night's turmoil. She ordered a sober breakfast from the steward, who was dressed in impeccable white, and in the Captain's personal service, but she did not send a message for anyone to come for her. She went up alone, dazzled by the cloudless sky, and she found Florentino Ariza talking to the Captain on the bridge. He looked different to her, not only because she saw him now with other eyes, but because in reality he had changed. Instead of the funereal clothing he had worn all his life, he was dressed in comfortable white shoes, slacks, and a linen shirt with an open collar, short sleeves, and his monogram embroidered on the breast pocket. He also had on a white Scottish cap and removable dark lenses over his perpetual eyeglasses for myopia. It was evident that everything was being used for the first time and had been bought just for the trip, with the exception of the well-worn belt of dark brown leather, which Fermina Daza noticed at first glance as if it were a fly in the soup. Seeing him like this, dressed just for her in so patent a manner, she could not hold back the fiery blush that rose to her face. She was embarrassed when she greeted him, and he was more embarrassed by her embarrassment. The knowledge that they were behaving as if they were sweethearts was even more embarrassing, and the knowledge that they were both embarrassed embarrassed them so much that Captain Samaritano noticed it with a tremor of compassion. He extricated them from their difficulty by spending the next two hours explaining the controls and the general operation of the ship. They were sailing very slowly up a river without banks that meandered between arid sand bars stretching to the horizon. But unlike the troubled waters at the mouth of the river, these were slow and clear and gleamed like metal under the merciless sun. Fermina Daza had the impression that it was a delta filled with islands of sand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="十一点钟时，她已准备停当，洗过澡，浑身散发着花一般的香皂气味，身着一套极为朴素的灰色纱罗寡妇服，已完全从夜晚的苦痛中恢复过来。她向穿着一尘不染的白色制服、专为船长服务的侍者要了份简单的早餐，但没有让他捎口信叫谁来接她。她独自走到指挥台上，天空万里无云，有些晃眼。她看见弗洛伦蒂诺·阿里萨正在与船长交谈。她觉得他像变了个人似的，不是因为她此时已对他另眼相看，而是因为他真的变了模样。他没有穿他那身穿了一辈子的参加葬礼似的衣服，取而代之的是一双舒适的白皮鞋，亚麻长裤，亚麻开领短袖衬衫，胸前的口袋上绣着他姓名首字母的花押字。此外，他头上还戴了顶苏格兰帽，也是白色的，那副他始终戴着的近视镜上则夹了一副可拆卸的深色镜片。显然，这些东西他都是第一次穿戴，而且是专为这次旅行才买的。只除了那条早已过旧的棕色皮带，费尔明娜·达萨一眼就看见了它，仿佛发现了汤中的苍蝇一般。看到他如此明显地为自己着意打扮，她的脸颊不禁泛起一抹火辣辣的红晕。跟他打招呼时，她心慌意乱。见她如此，他也慌乱起来。当两人意识到他们的举止竟像情侣一般，便越发不知所措，而当他们又意识到自己的窘态时，更是慌乱得一发不可收拾，以至于萨马利塔诺船长也注意到了这一点，心中不禁同情地为之一颤。他把他们从尴尬中解救出来，花了整整两个小时，向他们讲解如何指挥轮船以及轮船的机械构造。他们缓慢地航行在一段看不见两岸的河道上，河水在荒芜的河滩间一直延伸到地平线上。与交汇处的浑浊水流不同，这里的河水平缓而清澈，在无情的烈日下闪烁着金属的光芒。费尔明娜·达萨觉得，这里就像一片被沙岛包围的三角洲。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Florentino Ariza, in fact, was surprised by the changes, and would be even more surprised the following day, when navigation became more difficult and he realized that the Magdalena, father of waters, one of the great rivers of the world, was only an illusion of memory. Captain Samaritano explained to them how fifty years of uncontrolled deforestation had destroyed the river: the boilers of the river-boats had consumed the thick forest of colossal trees that had oppressed Florentino Ariza on his first voyage. Fermina Daza would not see the animals of her dreams: the hunters for skins from the tanneries in New Orleans had exterminated the alligators that, with yawning mouths, had played dead for hours on end in the gullies along the shore as they lay in wait for butterflies, the parrots with their shrieking and the monkeys with their lunatic screams had died out as the foliage was destroyed, the manatees with their great breasts that had nursed their young and wept on the banks in a forlorn woman's voice were an extinct species, annihilated by the armored bullets of hunters for sport.</div>

<div class="line_en">Captain Samaritano had an almost maternal affection for the manatees, because they seemed to him like ladies damned by some extravagant love, and he believed the truth of the legend that they were the only females in the animal kingdom that had no mates. He had always opposed shooting at them from the ship, which was the custom despite the laws prohibiting it. Once, a hunter from North Carolina, his papers in order, had disobeyed him, and with a well-aimed bullet from his Springfield rifle had shattered the head of a manatee mother whose baby became frantic with grief as it wailed over the fallen body. The Captain had the orphan brought on board so that he could care for it, and left the hunter behind on the deserted bank, next to the corpse of the murdered mother. He spent six months in prison as the result of diplomatic protests and almost lost his navigator's license, but he came out prepared to do it again, as often as the need arose. Still, that had been a historic episode: the orphaned manatee, which grew up and lived for many years in the rare-animal zoo in San Nicolás de las Barrancas, was the last of its kind seen along the river.</div>

She was not wrong: the trip was just beginning, and she would have many occasions to realize that she had not been mistaken.</div>

<div class="line_en">Fermina Daza and Florentino Ariza remained on the bridge until it was time for lunch. It was served a short while after they passed the town of Calamar on the opposite shore, which just a few years before had celebrated a perpetual fiesta and now was a ruined port with deserted streets. The only creature they saw from the boat was a woman dressed in white, signaling to them with a handkerchief. Fermina Daza could not understand why she was not picked up when she seemed so distressed, but the Captain explained that she was the ghost of a drowned woman whose deceptive signals were intended to lure ships off course into the dangerous whirlpools along the other bank. They passed so close that Fermina Daza saw her in sharp detail in the sunlight, and she had no doubt that she did not exist, but her face seemed familiar.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a long, hot day. Fermina Daza returned to her cabin after lunch for her inevitable siesta, but she did not sleep well because of a pain in her ear, which became worse when the boat exchanged mandatory greetings with another R. C. C. vessel as they passed each other a few leagues above Barranca Vieja. Florentino Ariza fell into instantaneous sleep in the main salon, where most of the passengers without cabins were sleeping as if it were midnight, and close to the spot where he had seen her disembark, he dreamed of Rosalba. She was traveling alone, wearing her Mompox costume from the last century, and it was she and not the child who slept in the wicker cage that hung from the ceiling. It was a dream at once so enigmatic and so amusing that he enjoyed it for the rest of the afternoon as he played dominoes with the Captain and two of the passengers who were friends of his.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那是漫长而炎热的一天。费尔明娜·达萨吃过午饭，便回到舱室去睡她那必不可少的午觉。但因为耳朵痛，她没能睡好。在“老峡谷”上游几里处，他们的船和另一艘CFC的船相遇，按规矩互相鸣笛致意，这让她的耳痛更严重了。弗洛伦蒂诺·阿里萨坐在大厅里打了个盹儿。和夜里一样，大部分没有舱室的旅客此刻都在那里睡觉。在离他当初看见罗萨尔芭上船的地方不远处，他在梦中见到了她。她在独自旅行，还穿着那身上世纪蒙波斯的衣服。但这一次是她，而不是那个婴儿，在那只挂在廊檐下的柳条鸟笼里午睡。这是一个既令人费解又十分有趣的梦，整个下午，他都一边和船长及两名旅客朋友玩多米诺骨牌，一边回味着这个梦。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It grew cooler as the sun went down, and the ship came back to life. The passengers seemed to emerge from a trance; they had just bathed and changed into fresh clothing, and they sat in the wicker armchairs in the salon, waiting for supper, which was announced at exactly five o'clock by a waiter who walked the deck from one end to the other and rang a sacristan's bell, to mocking applause. While they were eating, the band began to play fandangos, and the dancing continued until midnight.</div>

<div class="line_en">Fermina Daza did not care to eat because of the pain in her ear, and she watched as the first load of wood for the boilers was taken on from a bare gully where there was nothing but stacked logs and a very old man who supervised the operation. There did not seem to be another person for many leagues around. For Fermina Daza it was a long, tedious stop that would have been unthinkable on the ocean liners to Europe, and the heat was so intense that she could feel it even on her cooled observation deck. But when the boat weighed anchor again there was a cool breeze scented with the heart of the forest, and the music became more lively. In the town of Sitio Nuevo there was only one light in only one window in only one house, and the port office did not signal either cargo or passengers, so the boat passed by without a greeting.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="费尔明娜·达萨由于耳痛的烦扰，不想吃晚饭。她看见了航船首次加装锅炉木柴的情景。那是在一个光秃秃的峭壁旁，除了成堆的木头，以及照顾这项生意的一个年迈的老头儿之外，周围什么也没有，甚至方圆几里都空无一人。在费尔明娜·达萨看来，一次如此漫长而枯燥的临时停靠，在欧洲的远洋轮船上简直是不可想象的，即便在装有冷气的瞭望台里，她依旧感到酷热难耐。但当轮船重新起锚后，一阵清风吹来，仿佛让人闻到了森林内心的芬芳，船上的音乐也变得更欢快了。在希蒂奥·诺埃沃镇，只有一所房子中的一扇窗里亮着一盏孤灯，港口办公室也没有发出有货物或乘客登船的信号，因此，轮船没有鸣笛致意便开了过去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Fermina Daza had spent the entire afternoon wondering what stratagems Florentino Ariza would use to see her without knocking at her cabin door, and by eight o'clock she could no longer bear the longing to be with him. She went out into the passageway, hoping to meet him in what would seem a casual encounter, and she did not have to go very far: Florentino Ariza was sitting on a bench in the passageway, as silent and forlorn as he had been in the Park of the Evangels, and for over two hours he had been asking himself how he was going to see her. They both made the same gesture of surprise that they both knew was feigned, and together they strolled the first-class deck, crowded with young people, most of them boisterous students who, with some eagerness, were exhausting themselves in the final fling of their vacation. In the lounge, Florentino Ariza and Fermina Daza sat at the bar as if they were students themselves and drank bottled soft drinks, and suddenly she saw herself in a frightening situation. She said: "How awful!" Florentino Ariza asked her what she was thinking that caused her so much distress.</div>

<div class="line_en">They both decided to turn in when the music stopped, after a long, untroubled conversation on the dark observation deck. There was no moon, the sky was cloudy, and on the horizon flashes of lightning, with no claps of thunder, illuminated them for an instant. Florentino Ariza rolled cigarettes for her, but she did not smoke more than a few, for she was tormented by pain that would ease for a few moments and flare up again when the boat bellowed as it passed another ship or a sleeping village, or when it slowed to sound the depth of the river. He told her with what longing he had watched her at the Poetic Festival, on the balloon flight, on the acrobat's velocipede, with what longing he had waited all year for public festivals just so he could see her. She had often seen him as well, and she had never imagined that he was there only to see her. However, it was less than a year since she had read his letters and wondered how it was possible that he had never competed in the Poetic Festival: there was no doubt he would have won. Florentino Ariza lied to her: he wrote only for her, verses for her, and only he read them. Then it was she who reached for his hand in the darkness, and she did not find it waiting for her as she had waited for his the night before. Instead, she took him by surprise, and Florentino Ariza's heart froze.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们在昏暗的瞭望台上畅快地长谈起来，直到音乐停歇，才回去睡觉。这晚没有月亮，天空阴沉，地平线上划过一道道无声的闪电，时而在一瞬间将他们照亮。弗洛伦蒂诺·阿里萨为她卷好一支支香烟，但她被耳痛折磨着，只抽了四支。疼痛偶尔会减轻一些，但每当他们的船与其他船只相遇，或是从某个熟睡的村庄前经过，又或是为了试探水深而缓慢前行时，它那汽笛的鸣叫声便会加剧她的痛楚。他告诉她，每当他在花会上，在热气球飞行时，在杂技脚踏车的展览中看见她，他的心情是多么激动，一年又一年里，他又是多么热切地盼望公众节日的到来，只为了能够看见她。她也曾见过他许多次，但从未想过他出现在那里仅仅是为了与她相遇。然而，不到一年前，当读到他的信时，她曾突然问自己，他怎么可能从未参加过花会的诗赛。毫无疑问，如果他参加了，一定会获奖。弗洛伦蒂诺·阿里萨向她说了谎：他只为她写作，所有的诗句都是献给她的，而只有他自己是那些诗句的读者。这时，换成她在黑暗中主动搜寻他的手，当她找到时，它并不像前一晚她的手那样在等待，而是在被抓住时惊慌失措。弗洛伦蒂诺·阿里萨的心仿佛凝固了。">查看中文翻译</div>

She would have remained there until dawn, silent, with his hand perspiring ice into hers, but she could not endure the torment in her ear. So that when the music was over, and then the bustle of the ordinary passengers hanging their hammocks in the salon had ended, she realized that her pain was stronger than her desire to be with him. She knew that telling him about it would alleviate her suffering, but she did not because she did not want to worry him.

Still, as he walked to his cabin, making his way through the labyrinth of sleeping hammocks, he consoled himself with the thought that he must give off the same odor, except his was four years older, and she must have detected it on him, with the same emotion. It was the smell of human fermentation, which he had perceived in his oldest lovers and they had detected in him. The Widow Nazaret, who kept nothing to herself, had told him in a cruder way: "Now we stink like a henhouse." They tolerated each other because they were an even match: my odor against yours. On the other hand, he had often taken care of América Vicuña, whose diaper smell awakened maternal instincts in him, but he was disturbed at the idea that she had disliked his odor: the smell of a dirty old man.

<div class="line_en">At five o'clock he was beginning to doze off, when the ship's purser woke him in the port of Zambrano to hand him an urgent telegram. It was signed by Leona Cassiani and dated the previous day, and all its horror was contained in a single line: América Vicuña dead yesterday reasons unknown. At eleven o'clock in the morning he learned the details from Leona Cassiani in a telegraphic conference during which he himself operated the transmitting equipment for the first time since his years as a telegraph operator. América Vicuña, in the grip of mortal depression because she had failed her final examinations, had drunk a flask of laudanum stolen from the school infirmary. Florentino Ariza knew in the depths of his soul that the story was incomplete. But no: América Vicuña had left no explana tory note that would have allowed anyone to be blamed for her decision. The family, informed by Leona Cassiani, was arriving now from Puerto Padre, and the funeral would take place that afternoon at five o'clock. Florentino Ariza took a breath. The only thing he could do to stay alive was not to allow himself the anguish of that memory. He erased it from his mind, although from time to time in the years that were left to him he would feel it revive, with no warning and for no reason, like the sudden pang of an old scar.</div>

<div class="line_en">There were so few places for taking on wood, and they were so far apart from each other, that by the fourth day of the trip the New Fidelity had run out of fuel. She was stranded for almost a week while her crew searched bogs of ashes for the last scattered trees. There was no one else: the woodcutters had abandoned their trails, fleeing the ferocity of the lords of the earth, fleeing the invisible cholera, fleeing the larval wars that governments were bent on hiding with distracted decrees. In the meantime, the passengers in their boredom held swimming contests, organized hunting expeditions, and returned with live iguanas that they split open from top to bottom and sewed up again with baling needles after removing the clusters of soft, translucent eggs that they strung over the railings to dry. The poverty-stricken prostitutes from nearby villages followed in the path of the expeditions, improvised tents in the gullies along the shore, brought music and liquor with them, and caroused across the river from the stranded vessel.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="供应木柴的地方少之又少，而且间隔很远，旅行的第四天，“新忠诚号”就断了燃料。船停泊了几乎一个星期，在此期间，船上的人分批深入到四处漂浮着灰烬的沼泽中去，寻找零星分散的最后几棵树木。这里一个人也没有：樵夫们已离开了林间小路，以逃避大地之神的暴虐惩罚，逃避看不见的霍乱，以及政府借转移视线的法令试图掩盖的隐秘战争。这段时间，百无聊赖的旅客搞起了游泳比赛，还组织了狩猎探险队。他们带回一只只活鬣蜥，从上而下剖开它们的肚子，取出一串串半透明、软乎乎的蛋，然后用打背包的针把肚子缝上，将那一串串蛋挂在栏杆上晒干。附近村庄的穷妓女们追随着探险队的足迹，在岸边的峭壁上搭起临时帐篷，带来音乐和酒桶，在停泊不前的轮船对面狂欢起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The days that followed were hot and interminable. The river became muddy and narrow, and instead of the tangle of colossal trees that had astonished Florentino Ariza on his first voyage, there were calcinated flatlands stripped of entire forests that had been devoured by the boilers of the riverboats, and the debris of godforsaken villages whose streets remained flooded even in the crudest droughts. At night they were awakened not by the siren songs of manatees on the sandy banks but by the nauseating stench of corpses floating down to the sea. For there were no more wars or epidemics, but the swollen bodies still floated by. The Captain, for once, was solemn: "We have orders to tell the passengers that they are accidental drowning victims." Instead of the screeching of the parrots and the riotous noise of invisible monkeys, which at one time had intensified the stifling midday heat, all that was left was the vast silence of the ravaged land.</div>

<div class="line_en">Long before he became President of the R. C. C., Florentino Ariza had received alarming reports on the state of the river, but he barely read them. He would calm his associates: "Don't worry, by the time the wood is gone there will be boats fueled by oil." With his mind clouded by his passion for Fermina Daza, he never took the trouble to think about it, and by the time he realized the truth, there was nothing anyone could do except bring in a new river. Even in the days when the waters were at their best, the boats had to anchor at night, and then even the simple fact of being alive became unendurable. Most of the passengers, above all the Europeans, abandoned the pestilential stench of their cabins and spent the night walking the decks, brushing away all sorts of predatory creatures with the same towel they used to dry their incessant perspiration, and at dawn they were exhausted and swollen with bites. An English traveler at the beginning of the nineteenth century, referring to the journey by canoe and mule that could last as long as fifty days, had written: "This is one of the most miserable and uncomfortable pilgrimages that a human being can make." This had no longer been true during the first eighty years of steam navigation, and then it became true again forever when the alligators ate the last butterfly and the maternal manatees were gone, the parrots, the monkeys, the villages were gone: everything was gone.</div>

<div class="line_en">For the first three days Fermina Daza and Florentino Ariza were protected by the soft springtime of the enclosed observation deck, but when the wood was rationed and the cooling system began to fail, the Presidential Suite became a steam bath. She survived the nights because of the river breeze that came in through the open windows, and she frightened off the mosquitoes with a towel because the insecticide bomb was useless when the boat was anchored. Her earache had become unbearable, and one morning when she awoke it stopped suddenly and completely, like the sound of a smashed cicada. But she did not realize that she had lost the hearing in her left ear until that night, when Florentino Ariza spoke to her on that side and she had to turn her head to hear what he was saying. She did not tell anyone, for she was resigned to the fact that it was one of the many irremediable defects of old age.</div>

<div class="line_en">In spite of everything, the delay had been a providential accident for them. Florentino Ariza had once read: "Love becomes greater and nobler in calamity." The humidity in the Presidential Suite sub merged them in an unreal lethargy in which it was easier to love without questions. They spent unimaginable hours holding hands in the armchairs by the railing, they exchanged unhurried kisses, they enjoyed the rapture of caresses without the pitfalls of impatience. On the third stupefying night she waited for him with a bottle of anisette, which she used to drink in secret with Cousin Hildebranda's band and later, after she was married and had children, behind closed doors with the friends from her borrowed world. She needed to be somewhat intoxicated in order not to think about her fate with too much lucidity, but Florentino Ariza thought it was to give herself courage for the final step. Encouraged by that illusion, he dared to explore her withered neck with his fingertips, her bosom armored in metal stays, her hips with their decaying bones, her thighs with their aging veins. She accepted with pleasure, her eyes closed, but she did not tremble, and she smoked and drank at regular intervals. At last, when his caresses slid over her belly, she had enough anisette in her heart.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不管怎样，轮船的延误对他们来说是天意的磨难。弗洛伦蒂诺·阿里萨曾读到过这样一句话：“灾难中的爱情更加伟大而高尚。”总统舱里的潮湿使他们沉浸在一种超乎现实的昏睡之中，这种环境更容易使人相爱而互不询问。在难以想象的漫长时间里，他们几小时几小时地坐在栏杆前的靠背椅上，手拉着手，缓慢地亲吻，陶醉于爱抚之中，从不会因失去耐心而扫兴。第三个昏沉的夜晚，她准备了一瓶茴香酒等他到来。她曾同伊尔德布兰达那群表姐妹们一起偷偷喝过这种酒，结婚生子之后，她又和那个本不属于她的世界的女友们一起关起房门来喝过。此刻，她需要让自己糊涂一点，为的是不必太清醒地去思索命运。可弗洛伦蒂诺·阿里萨却以为，她这样做是为了鼓起勇气迈出最后一步。在这种幻想的驱使下，他大起胆子，用手指肚探索着她那干瘪的脖颈，她那仿佛装着金属骨架的胸部，骨骼已被销蚀的臀部，以及那老母鹿般的大腿。她闭着眼，心满意足地任他抚摸，但并没有颤抖，只是抽着烟，时不时地呷一口酒。最后，当他的爱抚滑至她的小腹时，她的心里已经充满了足够的茴香酒。">查看中文翻译</div>

They spoke of themselves, of their divergent lives, of the incredible coincidence of their lying naked in a dark cabin on a stranded boat when reason told them they had time only for death.

But she liked the spirited way in which he said it. Florentino Ariza, for his part, suddenly asked himself what he would never have dared to ask himself before: what kind of secret life had she led outside of her marriage? Nothing would have surprised him, because he knew that women are just like men in their secret adventures: the same stratagems, the same sudden inspirations, the same betrayals without remorse. But he was wise not to ask the question. Once, when her relations with the Church were already strained, her confessor had asked her out of the blue if she had ever been unfaithful to her husband, and she had stood up without responding, without concluding, without saying goodbye, and had never gone to confession again, with that confessor or with any other. But Florentino Ariza's prudence had an unexpected reward: she stretched out her hand in the darkness, caressed his belly, his flanks, his almost hairless pubis. She said: "You have skin like a baby's." Then she took the final step: she searched for him where he was not, she searched again without hope, and she found him, unarmed.</div>

<div class="line_en">It had happened to him sometimes, and he had learned to live with the phantom: each time he had to learn again, as if it were the first time. He took her hand and laid it on his chest: Fermina Daza felt the old, untiring heart almost bursting through his skin, beating with the strength, the rapidity, the irregularity of an adolescent's. He said: "Too much love is as bad for this as no love at all." But he said it without conviction: he was ashamed, furious with himself, longing for some reason to blame her for his failure. She knew it, and began to provoke his defenseless body with mock caresses, like a kitten delighting in cruelty, until he could no longer endure the martyrdom and he returned to his cabin. She thought about him until dawn, convinced at last of her love, and as the anisette left her in slow waves, she was invaded by the anguished fear that he was angry and would never return.</div>

His guard was up, and she realized that he did not expose his weapon by accident, but displayed it as if it were a war trophy in order to give himself courage.

<div class="line_en">In the middle of the bustling market, a very old man with an inconsolable expression on his face was pulling chicks out of the pockets of his beggar's coat. He had appeared without warning, making his way through the crowd in a tattered overcoat that had belonged to someone much taller and heavier than he. He took off his hat, placed it brim up on the dock in case anyone wanted to throw him a coin, and began to empty his pockets of handfuls of pale baby chicks that seemed to proliferate in his fingers. In only a moment the dock appeared to be carpeted with cheeping chicks running everywhere among hurried travelers who trampled them without realizing it. Fascinated by the marvelous spectacle that seemed to be performed in her honor, for she was the only person watching it, Fermina Daza did not notice when the passengers for the return trip began to come on board. The party was over: among them she saw many faces she knew, some of them friends who until a short while ago had attended her in her grief, and she rushed to take refuge in her cabin. Florentino Ariza found her there, distraught: she would rather die than be seen on a pleasure trip, by people she knew, so soon after the death of her husband. Her preoccupation affected Florentino Ariza so much that he promised to think of some way to protect her other than keeping her in the cabin.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在喧闹的市场中，一位看上去很可怜的老人正从乞丐外衣的各个口袋里掏出一只只小鸡来。他是突然从人群中挤出来的，身上那件破烂不堪的大衣显然曾属于一个比他魁梧得多的人。他摘下帽子，口朝上放到码头上，看看是否有人愿意往里面扔一枚硬币。接着，他从各个口袋里掏出一只一只稚嫩的、几乎没有颜色的小鸡来，仿佛是从他的指间繁殖出来的。一时间，码头上像铺了一层小鸡地毯，它们惊慌失措地啾啾叫着，到处乱跑，有些匆忙的旅客把它们踩在脚下都全然不知。费尔明娜·达萨被眼前神奇的景象迷住了，她觉得这仿佛是在欢迎她的到来，因为只有她看到了这一切。她看得出神，甚至没有注意到返程的旅客是何时开始上船的。她的节日狂欢结束了：在陆续登船的人中，她看到了许多熟悉的面孔，其中一些是她的朋友，前不久还曾在服丧期间陪伴过她。她仓皇地躲回舱室。弗洛伦蒂诺·阿里萨发现她万分沮丧：她宁愿死，也不愿被那个圈子中的人发现她在丈夫刚去世不久就愉快地出门旅行。她的垂头丧气让弗洛伦蒂诺·阿里萨心疼不已，他发誓要想出办法来保护她，而不是让她像坐牢似的待在舱室里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The idea came to him all at once as they were having supper in the private dining room. The Captain was troubled by a problem he had wanted to discuss for a long time with Florentino Ariza, who always evaded him with his usual answer: "Leona Cassiani can handle those problems better than I can." This time, however, he listened to him. The fact was that the boats carried cargo upriver, but came back empty, while the opposite occurred with passengers. "And the advantage of cargo is that it pays more and eats nothing," he said. Fermina Daza, bored with the men's enervated discussion concerning the possibility of establishing differential fares, ate without will. But Florentino Ariza pursued the discussion to its end, and only then did he ask the question that the Captain thought was the prelude to a solution:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当他们在私人餐厅用晚餐时，他突然想出了主意。船长一直在为某个问题烦恼，好久以前就想跟弗洛伦蒂诺·阿里萨讨论一下，但阿里萨总是以他那一贯的理由避而不谈：“这些琐事，莱昂娜·卡西亚尼比我处理得更好。”然而，这一次他仔细听了船长的话。事情是这样的，船上行时载着货物，回程却是空的，而载客情况却正好相反。“载货是有利的，付的钱多，而且货物还不用吃饭。”他说。费尔明娜·达萨的这顿晚餐吃得索然无味，两个男人就设立不同票价制度的好处进行的冗长讨论让她感到无聊。但弗洛伦蒂诺·阿里萨坚持到最后，才提出了一个在船长看来可能是拯救方案之前奏的问题：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Captain said that it was possible, but only hypothetically. The R. C. C. had business commitments that Florentino Ariza was more familiar with than he was, it had contracts for cargo, passengers, mail, and a great deal more, and most of them were unbreakable. The only thing that would allow them to bypass all that was a case of cholera on board. The ship would be quarantined, it would hoist the yellow flag and sail in a state of emergency. Captain Samaritano had needed to do just that on several occasions because of the many cases of cholera along the river, although later the health authorities had obliged the doctors to sign death certificates that called the cases common dysentery. Besides, many times in the history of the river the yellow plague flag had been flown in order to evade taxes, or to avoid picking up an undesirable passenger, or to elude inopportune inspections. Florentino Ariza reached for Fermina Daza's hand under the table.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="船长说，这只在假设中成立。CFC有各种劳务协议，这一点弗洛伦蒂诺·阿里萨比谁都清楚，关于载货、载客、邮件运输以及其他很多项义务都签有合同，其中大部分是不能推卸的。唯有一种情况可以跳过一切条款，那就是船上发生瘟疫。轮船宣布进入隔离检疫，升起黄旗，在紧急状态下航行。由于沿河出现过很多次霍乱，萨马利塔诺船长曾有好几次不得不这样做，尽管后来卫生部门强迫医生签署了死者死于普通痢疾的证明。此外，在这条河流的历史上，很多时候轮船升起代表瘟疫的黄旗是为了逃避税收，或是不愿搭载某个乘客，又或是躲避不合时宜的检查。弗洛伦蒂诺·阿里萨在桌下找到了费尔明娜·达萨的手。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Florentino Ariza was serious, of course, and he signed the order. After all, everyone knew that the time of cholera had not ended despite all the joyful statistics from the health officials. As for the ship, there was no problem. The little cargo they had taken on was transferred, they told the passengers there had been a mechanical failure, and early that morning they sent them on their way on a ship that belonged to another company. If such things were done for so many immoral, even contemptible reasons, Florentino Ariza could not see why it would not be legitimate to do them for love. All that the Captain asked was that they stop in Puerto Nare to pick up someone who would accompany him on the voyage: he, too, had his secret heart.</div>

<div class="line_en">So the New Fidelity weighed anchor at dawn the next day, without cargo or passengers, and with the yellow cholera flag waving jubilantly from the mainmast. At dusk in Puerto Nare they picked up a woman who was even taller and stouter than the Captain, an uncommon beauty who needed only a beard to be hired by a circus. Her name was Zenaida Neves, but the Captain called her "my wild woman": an old friend whom he would pick up in one port and leave in another, and who came on board followed by the winds of joy. In that sad place of death, where Florentino Ariza relived his memories of Rosalba when he saw the train from Envigado struggling to climb the old mule trail, there was an Amazonian downpour that would continue with very few pauses for the rest of the trip. But no one cared: the floating fiesta had its own roof. That night, as a personal contribution to the revelry, Fermina Daza went down to the galley amid the ovations of the crew and prepared a dish for everyone that she created and that Florentino Ariza christened Eggplant al Amor.</div>

<div class="line_en">Fermina Daza was horrified when she heard the boat's horn with her good ear, but by the second day of anisette she could hear better with both of them. She discovered that roses were more fragrant than before, that the birds sang at dawn much better than before, and that God had created a manatee and placed it on the bank at Tamalameque just so it could awaken her. The Captain heard it, had the boat change course, and at last they saw the enormous matron nursing the baby that she held in her arms. Neither Florentino nor Fermina was aware of how well they understood each other: she helped him to take his enemas, she got up before he did to brush the false teeth he kept in a glass while he slept, and she solved the problem of her misplaced spectacles, for she could use his for reading and mending. When she awoke one morning, she saw him sewing a button on his shirt in the darkness, and she hurried to do it for him before he could say the ritual phrase about needing two wives. On the other hand, the only thing she needed from him was that he cup a pain in her back.</div>

It was a rapid journey: the boat was light and the currents favorable and even improved by the floods that rushed down from the headwaters, where it rained as much that week as it had during the entire voyage. Some villages fired charitable cannons for them to frighten away the cholera, and they expressed their gratitude with a mournful bellow.

<div class="line_en">The night before their arrival they had a grand party with paper garlands and colored lights. The weather cleared at nightfall. Holding each other very close, the Captain and Zenaida danced the first boleros that were just beginning to break hearts in those days. Florentino Ariza dared to suggest to Fermina Daza that they dance their private waltz, but she refused. Nevertheless she kept time with her head and her heels all night, and there was even a moment when she danced sitting down without realizing it, while the Captain merged with his young wild woman in the shadows of the bolero. She drank so much anisette that she had to be helped up the stairs, and she suffered an attack of laughing until she cried, which alarmed everyone. However, when at last she recovered her self-possession in the perfumed oasis of her cabin, they made the tranquil, wholesome love of experienced grandparents, which she would keep as her best memory of that lunatic voyage. Contrary to what the Captain and Zenaida supposed, they no longer felt like newlyweds, and even less like belated lovers. It was as if they had leapt over the arduous calvary of conjugal life and gone straight to the heart of love. They were together in silence like an old married couple wary of life, beyond the pitfalls of passion, beyond the brutal mockery of hope and the phantoms of disillusion: beyond love. For they had lived together long enough to know that lo ve was always love, anytime and anyplace, but it was more solid the closer it came to death.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到港的前一天晚上，他们举行了一场盛大的晚会，四处挂起纸花环和彩灯。黄昏时，雨停了。船长和塞娜依达搂得紧紧地跳了几曲波莱罗舞，在那年月，这种舞正开始迷醉人心。弗洛伦蒂诺·阿里萨大着胆子向费尔明娜·达萨提议，他们也伴着那首只属于两人的华尔兹跳上一曲，但她拒绝了。不过整个晚上，她都在用脑袋和鞋跟打着拍子，甚至有那么片刻，当船长和他那温柔的魔女在昏暗中如胶似漆地跳着波莱罗时，她竟不知不觉地在椅子上舞动起来。她喝了那么多茴香酒，以至于最后大家不得不扶着她走上楼梯。她突然一边哭一边笑起来，让所有人都慌了手脚。但在舱室里那凝滞的香气中，她最终控制住了自己。他们平静而健康地做了爱。这是满脸皱纹的祖父祖母之间的爱，它将作为这次疯狂旅行中最美好的回忆，铭刻在两个人的记忆之中。同船长和塞娜依达猜想的不同，他们之间的感觉并不像新婚燕尔的夫妇，更不像相聚恨晚的情人。他们仿佛一举越过了漫长艰辛的夫妻生活，义无反顾地直达爱情的核心。他们像一对经历了生活磨炼的老夫老妻，在宁静中超越了激情的陷阱，超越了幻想的无情嘲弄和醒悟的海市蜃楼：超越了爱情。因为他们已在一起生活了足够长时间，足以发现无论何时何地，爱情始终都是爱情，只不过距离死亡越近，爱就越浓郁。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Florentino Ariza, for his part, began to revive old memories with a violin borrowed from the orchestra, and in half a day he could play the waltz of "The Crowned Goddess" for her, and he played it for hours until they forced him to stop. One night, for the first time in her life, Fermina Daza suddenly awoke choking on tears of sorrow, not of rage, at the memory of the old couple in the boat beaten to death by the boatman. On the other hand, the incessant rain did not affect her, and she thought too late that perhaps Paris was not as gloomy as it had seemed, that Santa Fe did not have so many funerals passing along the streets. The dream of other voyages with Florentino Ariza appeared on the horizon: mad voyages, free of trunks, free of social commitments: voyages of love.</div>

Neither one could imagine being in any other home but the cabin, or eating in any other way but on the ship, or living any other life, for that would be alien to them forever. It was, indeed, like dying. He could not go back to sleep. He lay on his back in bed, his hands crossed behind his head. At a certain moment, the pangs of grief for América Vicuña made him twist with pain, and he could not hold off the truth any longer: he locked himself in the bathroom and cried, slowly, until his last tear was shed.

<div class="line_en">Fermina Daza and Florentino Ariza had heard everything from their table, but that did not seem to matter to the Captain. He continued to eat in silence, and his bad humor was evident in the manner in which he breached the rules of etiquette that sustained the legendary reputation of the riverboat captains. He broke apart his four fried eggs with the tip of his knife, and he ate them with slices of green plantain, which he placed whole in his mouth and chewed with savage delight. Fermina Daza and Florentino Ariza looked at him without speaking, as if waiting on a school bench to hear their final grades. They had not exchanged a word during his conversation with the health patrol, nor did they have the slightest idea of what would become of their lives, but they both knew that the Captain was thinking for them: they could see it in the throbbing of his temples.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="费尔明娜·达萨和弗洛伦蒂诺·阿里萨在餐桌前听到了这一切，船长却好像满不在乎。他继续默不作声地吃着饭，糟糕的心情一目了然，已顾不上保持内河船长在礼仪和修养方面一贯的好名声。他用刀尖剖开盘子里的四只煎鸡蛋，把它们同整块整块的油炸青香蕉卷在一起塞进嘴里，带着野蛮的喜悦大嚼起来。费尔明娜·达萨和弗洛伦蒂诺·阿里萨一言不发地看着他，就像坐在学校板凳上等待宣读期末考试成绩的学生。在船长和卫生局的武装巡逻队对话时，他们彼此一句话也没有说，今后的生活会变成什么样，他们心中一点主意也没有。但两个人都清楚，船长正在为他们打算：从他太阳穴的跳动就可以看出。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">While he finished off his portion of eggs, the tray of fried plantains, and the pot of café con leche, the ship left the bay with its boilers quiet, made its way along the channels through blankets of taruya, the river lotus with purple blossoms and large heart-shaped leaves, and returned to the marshes. The water was iridescent with the universe of fishes floating on their sides, killed by the dynamite of stealthy fishermen, and all the birds of the earth and the water circled above them with metallic cries. The wind from the Caribbean blew in the windows along with the racket made by the birds, and Fermina Daza felt in her blood the wild beating of her free will. To her right, the muddy, frugal estuary of the Great Magdalena River spread out to the other side of the world.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在船长打发掉那盘煎鸡蛋和油炸香蕉块，喝光一罐牛奶咖啡时，轮船带着安安静静的锅炉，驶出了海港，穿过狭窄的水道，在一层厚厚的凤眼莲、深紫色的莲花和心形的大荷叶中间开出一条路来，返回沼泽地去了。水面上闪着银光，到处都漂浮着横陈的死鱼，全是被偷偷捕鱼的渔民用炸药炸死的。陆地和水上的鸟儿在它们的上空盘旋，发出金属般剌耳的叫声。加勒比的海风伴随着鸟儿的喧闹从窗户飘了进来。费尔明娜·达萨感到自己血液中的自由意志一阵沸腾。右边，马格达莱纳大河潮淹区的河水，浑浊而缓慢地向世界的另一边延伸。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Florentino Ariza listened to him without blinking. Then he looked through the windows at the complete circle of the quadrant on the mariner's compass, the clear horizon, the December sky without a single cloud, the waters that could be navigated forever, and he said:</div>

<div class="line_en">When there was nothing left to eat on the plates, the Captain wiped his lips with a corner of the tablecloth and broke into indecent slang that ended once and for all the reputation for fine speech enjoyed by the riverboat captains. For he was not speaking to them or to anyone else, but was trying instead to come to terms with his own rage. His conclusion, after a string of barbaric curses, was that he could find no way out of the mess he had gotten into with the cholera flag.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当盘子里再没有东西可吃时，船长用桌布的一角抹了抹嘴，放肆无礼地大骂了一通黑话，彻底毁掉了内河船长言行文雅的美誉。他不是冲他们，也不是冲着任何人说的，只是想要发泄心中的怒火。在一连串粗鲁的咒骂之后，他的结论是他实在不知道如何才能走出霍乱黄旗带来的困境。">查看中文翻译</div>
