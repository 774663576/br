<div class="line_en">The story which Philip made out in one way and another was terrible. One of the grievances of the women-students was that Fanny Price would never share their gay meals in restaurants, and the reason was obvious: she had been oppressed by dire poverty. He remembered the luncheon they had eaten together when first he came to Paris and the ghoulish appetite which had disgusted him: he realised now that she ate in that manner because she was ravenous. The concierge told him what her food had consisted of. A bottle of milk was left for her every day and she brought in her own loaf of bread; she ate half the loaf and drank half the milk at mid-day when she came back from the school, and consumed the rest in the evening. It was the same day after day. Philip thought with anguish of what she must have endured. She had never given anyone to understand that she was poorer than the rest, but it was clear that her money had been coming to an end, and at last she could not afford to come any more to the studio. The little room was almost bare of furniture, and there were no other clothes than the shabby brown dress she had always worn. Philip searched among her things for the address of some friend with whom he could communicate. He found a piece of paper on which his own name was written a score of times. It gave him a peculiar shock. He supposed it was true that she had loved him; he thought of the emaciated body, in the brown dress, hanging from the nail in the ceiling; and he shuddered. But if she had cared for him why did she not let him help her? He would so gladly have done all he could. He felt remorseful because he had refused to see that she looked upon him with any particular feeling, and now these words in her letter were infinitely pathetic: I can't bear the thought that anyone else should touch me. She had died of starvation.</div>

<div class="line_en">The short ceremony was infinitely dreadful in the cold gray morning. Half a dozen people who had worked with Fanny Price at the studio came to the funeral, Mrs. Otter because she was massiere and thought it her duty, Ruth Chalice because she had a kind heart, Lawson, Clutton, and Flanagan. They had all disliked her during her life. Philip, looking across the cemetery crowded on all sides with monuments, some poor and simple, others vulgar, pretentious, and ugly, shuddered. It was horribly sordid. When they came out Albert Price asked Philip to lunch with him. Philip loathed him now and he was tired; he had not been sleeping well, for he dreamed constantly of Fanny Price in the torn brown dress, hanging from the nail in the ceiling; but he could not think of an excuse.</div>

<div class="line_en">He threw out a few artful questions, and Philip discovered that he was eager to hear about the painter's life in Paris. He represented it to himself as deplorable, but he was anxious for details of the orgies which his fancy suggested to him. With sly winks and discreet sniggering he conveyed that he knew very well that there was a great deal more than Philip confessed. He was a man of the world, and he knew a thing or two. He asked Philip whether he had ever been to any of those places in Montmartre which are celebrated from Temple Bar to the Royal Exchange. He would like to say he had been to the Moulin Rouge. The luncheon was very good and the wine excellent. Albert Price expanded as the processes of digestion went satisfactorily forwards.</div>

<div class="line_en">Philip was too restless to work that afternoon, so he jumped on a bus and crossed the river to see whether there were any pictures on view at Durand-Ruel's. After that he strolled along the boulevard. It was cold and wind-swept. People hurried by wrapped up in their coats, shrunk together in an effort to keep out of the cold, and their faces were pinched and careworn. It was icy underground in the cemetery at Montparnasse among all those white tombstones. Philip felt lonely in the world and strangely homesick. He wanted company. At that hour Cronshaw would be working, and Clutton never welcomed visitors; Lawson was painting another portrait of Ruth Chalice and would not care to be disturbed. He made up his mind to go and see Flanagan. He found him painting, but delighted to throw up his work and talk. The studio was comfortable, for the American had more money than most of them, and warm; Flanagan set about making tea. Philip looked at the two heads that he was sending to the Salon.</div>

<div class="line_en">Flanagan, though he was the most scatter-brained person in the world, had a tenderness of heart which was unexpected and charming. Whenever anyone was ill he installed himself as sick-nurse. His gaiety was better than any medicine. Like many of his countrymen he had not the English dread of sentimentality which keeps so tight a hold on emotion; and, finding nothing absurd in the show of feeling, could offer an exuberant sympathy which was often grateful to his friends in distress. He saw that Philip was depressed by what he had gone through and with unaffected kindliness set himself boisterously to cheer him up. He exaggerated the Americanisms which he knew always made the Englishmen laugh and poured out a breathless stream of conversation, whimsical, high-spirited, and jolly. In due course they went out to dinner and afterwards to the Gaite Montparnasse, which was Flanagan's favourite place of amusement. By the end of the evening he was in his most extravagant humour. He had drunk a good deal, but any inebriety from which he suffered was due much more to his own vivacity than to alcohol. He proposed that they should go to the Bal Bullier, and Philip, feeling too tired to go to bed, willingly enough consented. They sat down at a table on the platform at the side, raised a little from the level of the floor so that they could watch the dancing, and drank a bock. Presently Flanagan saw a friend and with a wild shout leaped over the barrier on to the space where they were dancing. Philip watched the people. Bullier was not the resort of fashion. It was Thursday night and the place was crowded. There were a number of students of the various faculties, but most of the men were clerks or assistants in shops; they wore their everyday clothes, ready-made tweeds or queer tail-coats, and their hats, for they had brought them in with them, and when they danced there was no place to put them but their heads. Some of the women looked like servant-girls, and some were painted hussies, but for the most part they were shop-girls. They were poorly-dressed in cheap imitation of the fashions on the other side of the river. The hussies were got up to resemble the music-hall artiste or the dancer who enjoyed notoriety at the moment; their eyes were heavy with black and their cheeks impudently scarlet. The hall was lit by great white lights, low down, which emphasised the shadows on the faces; all the lines seemed to harden under it, and the colours were most crude. It was a sordid scene. Philip leaned over the rail, staring down, and he ceased to hear the music. They danced furiously. They danced round the room, slowly, talking very little, with all their attention given to the dance. The room was hot, and their faces shone with sweat. it seemed to Philip that they had thrown off the guard which people wear on their expression, the homage to convention, and he saw them now as they really were. In that moment of abandon they were strangely animal: some were foxy and some were wolf-like; and others had the long, foolish face of sheep. Their skins were sallow from the unhealthy life they led and the poor food they ate. Their features were blunted by mean interests, and their little eyes were shifty and cunning. There was nothing of nobility in their bearing, and you felt that for all of them life was a long succession of petty concerns and sordid thoughts. The air was heavy with the musty smell of humanity. But they danced furiously as though impelled by some strange power within them, and it seemed to Philip that they were driven forward by a rage for enjoyment. They were seeking desperately to escape from a world of horror. The desire for pleasure which Cronshaw said was the only motive of human action urged them blindly on, and the very vehemence of the desire seemed to rob it of all pleasure. They were hurried on by a great wind, helplessly, they knew not why and they knew not whither. Fate seemed to tower above them, and they danced as though everlasting darkness were beneath their feet. Their silence was vaguely alarming. It was as if life terrified them and robbed them of power of speech so that the shriek which was in their hearts died at their throats. Their eyes were haggard and grim; and notwithstanding the beastly lust that disfigured them, and the meanness of their faces, and the cruelty, notwithstanding the stupidness which was worst of all, the anguish of those fixed eyes made all that crowd terrible and pathetic. Philip loathed them, and yet his heart ached with the infinite pity which filled him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他虽是普天之下最没定性的人，但却有着出人意料的柔软心肠。这也是他的魅力所在。不管谁生病了，他都会献上体贴入微的照顾。对于病人来说，弗拉纳根给他们带来的欢声笑语几乎胜过了所有的灵丹妙药。他和其他美国人一样敢于表达自己内心的情感，从不把情绪憋在心里。他觉得心里想什么就说什么并不丢人，也因此很乐意向心情沮丧的朋友们表达深切的同情和安慰。朋友们因此都对他心存感激。他看出菲利普在经历了这一串打击之后情绪不佳，所以就变着法地试图让他高兴起来。他知道英国人都对美国口音忍俊不禁，所以说话的时候故意操起一口浓重的美国腔，手舞足蹈、兴高采烈地说着些奇奇怪怪的话，就为博菲利普一笑。他俩在外面吃过饭后，又决定去蒙帕纳斯乐园瞅瞅，这是他最爱去的地方。天一黑，兴致就变得更高。虽说酒喝了不少，但令他晕头转向、眼冒金星的不是酒精起的作用，而是他的满腔澎湃激情。酒过三巡，他又提议转战布里埃舞厅，菲利普此时也累过了劲儿，不想上床睡觉，便欣然答应一同前往。他们坐在舞厅一侧高台上的桌子旁喝着啤酒，这个高度正好可以看到人群在台子下面翩翩起舞。弗拉纳根忽然瞅见一个朋友，大喊一声越过栏杆就跳到舞池里去了。菲利普还待在原地，打量着身边的男男女女。布里埃算不上城里的时髦舞厅。周四晚上这里挤满了寻欢作乐的人。来自各个学校的学生很多，可大部分都是小职员或商店里的打杂小工。他们穿着日常便装，要么是便宜的花呢套装，要么是样子古里古怪的燕尾服。戴进来的帽子跳舞的时候也没有地儿搁，只能继续待在头上。舞厅的女人里有几个看上去像别人家的侍女，还有一些描眉画眼、举止轻佻，其他则大多都是售货员。她们穿着打扮都很寒酸，极力模仿河对岸的时髦女子。那些放荡的女人脸上化着浓妆，活像杂耍剧院里的演员或是当下名声最臭的舞者：眼皮上一层厚厚黑影，脸蛋上两坨胭脂涂得张牙舞爪。低垂的白炽灯照得舞厅一片雪亮，人们脸上的阴影愈发明显；舞厅里的线条好像更加死板僵硬，周围环绕的五颜六色此刻也愈显粗糙不堪——好一幅光怪陆离的画面。菲利普身子靠在栏杆上，盯着台子下面形形色色的人，耳边的音乐声好像戛然而止了。这些人仿佛在群魔乱舞，慢慢地绕着舞厅打转；他们很少说话，一心扑在跳舞上。屋里很热，汗津津的脸上泛着光。菲利普觉得他们已经卸下脸上虚伪的面具，放下对世俗礼节的提防，露出了自己的真实面容。此刻，他们变成一群奇怪的野兽：有些像狐狸，有些像狼，剩下的则长了一张长长的、愚蠢的羊脸。这些终日劳碌还吃不饱穿不暖的人皮肤都粗糙蜡黄，他们在对蝇头小利的追逐中日益麻木了表情，只剩一双狡猾的小眼儿还在滴溜溜地打转，举手投足之间没有丝毫气质可言。你能感到这种人的生活里只有数不清的鸡毛蒜皮和说不完的怨声载道。空气里弥漫着浓浓的汗臭味。舞池里的人仿佛被自己体内某种说不清道不明的力量控制着，疯狂地舞个不停，菲利普觉得让他们着魔的力量就是追求享乐的欲望。这些人只是在找寻一个出口，企图能就此逃离现实世界的恐怖压抑。克朗肖说过对享乐的追求是促使人类盲目前行的唯一动力，也正是这种放肆的欲望剥夺了所有快乐。我们像被大风裹挟着，无可奈何、四处飘渺，不知道这阵风从哪而来，也不知道它要带我们到哪去。命运之神仿佛凌驾于舞池中的人群之上，而他们还在狂妄疯癫地跳着，似要将死亡的永恒黑暗踩在脚下。菲利普隐隐有些害怕：他们为何不说话呢？是生活震吓住了他们，还是夺走了他们张嘴的权利，让他们把心中腾起的尖叫呐喊全都梗在喉头？他们的眼神凶狠而冷酷。尽管可怕的兽欲让他们没了人样，尽管他们的脸上写满暴虐和卑劣，尽管除了所有的恶劣品行之外，他们还愚蠢得让人无法容忍，他们眼底的痛苦却一览无遗。如此可怕，又如此可怜。一股厌恶之情涌上菲利普的头顶，可对他们的深切怜悯又让他的心绞痛起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
