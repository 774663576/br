<div class="line_en">Jeffrey Greggson was one islander who, as yet, had no interest in esthetics or science, the two main preoccupations of his elders. But he heartily approved of the Colony, for purely personal reasons. The sea, never more than a few kilometres away in any direction, fascinated him. Most of his short life had been spent far inland, and he was not yet accustomed to the novelty of being surrounded by water. He was a good swimmer, and would often cycle off with other young friends, carrying his fins and mask, to go exploring the shallower water of the lagoon. At first Jean was not very happy about this, but after she had made a few dives herself; she lost her fear of the sea and its strange creatures and let Jeffrey enjoy himself as he pleased -- on condition that he never swam alone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杰弗里·格雷森生活在岛上，对美学和科学却没有丝毫兴趣，虽然这两项是父辈的两大主要行业。他喜欢这里完全是个人的原因，从岛上任何一个地方到海边都不会超过几公里的路程，海实在让人着迷。以往的岁月他都在内陆度过，到这儿以后，他一直沉迷在被海水包围的新奇感觉里。他游泳游得很棒，经常和小伙伴们一道拿着潜水蹼和面罩，骑车到环礁湖的浅水中探险。最初简不让他去，等她自己潜过几次水之后，对海水和里面奇形怪状的海底生物不再害怕时就任由孩子去了，只要他不是独自一人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The other member of the Greggson household who approved of the change was Fey, the beautiful golden retriever who nominally belonged to George, but could seldom be detached from Jeffrey. The two were inseparable, both by day and -- if Jean had not put her foot down -- by night. Only when Jeffrey went off on his bicycle did Fey remain at home, lying listlessly in front of the door and staring down the road with moist, mournful eyes, her muzzle resting on her paws.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="格雷森家还有一个成员喜欢这里，就是那只漂亮的金毛猎狗菲伊，从名分上讲，它属于乔治，却和杰弗里形影不离。他们不仅白天如影随形，晚上，如果不是简坚决反对，他们还会一起睡觉。杰弗里蹬上自行车出门，菲伊就留在家中，无精打呆地躺在门前，鼻子和嘴贴在爪子上，一双水灵灵的眼睛忧伤地、眼巴巴地望着通往山下的公路。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This was rather mortifying to George, who had paid a stiff price for Fey and her pedigree. It looked as if he would have to wait for the next generation -- due in three months -- before he could have a dog of his own. Jean had other views on the subject. She liked Fey, but felt that one hound per house was quite sufficient.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="乔治为此很伤心，它是自己花大价钱买来的名犬，看来只有等菲伊三个月后生下小狗，他才能有一条真正属于自己的狗了。简不同意，她喜欢菲伊，家里有一条狗就够了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Only Jennifer Anne had not yet decided whether she liked the Colony. That, however, was hardly surprising, for she had so far seen nothing of the world beyond the plastic panels of her cot, and had, as yet, very little suspicion that such a place existed.</div>

<div class="line_en">George Greggson did not often think about the past: he was too busy with plans for the future, too much occupied by his work and his children. It was rare indeed that his mind went back across the years to that evening in Africa, and he never talked about it with Jean. By mutual consent, the subject was avoided, and since that day they had never visited the Boyces again, despite repeated invitations. They called Rupert with fresh excuses several times a year, and lately he had ceased to bother them. His marriage to Maia, rather to everyone's surprise, still seemed to be flourishing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="乔治很少有时间回忆过去，他既要为将来打算，又要忙于工作，照顾孩子。他自然也很少回想起那个非洲之夜以后的岁月，也从来没有和简提起过，两人都不愿提起这事，他们也再没有拜访鲁柏特，尽管他不停地发来邀请，他们每年都要找好些新理由婉言谢绝，最近他终于不再邀请他们了。让人颇感意外的是，鲁柏特和梅娅的婚姻居然十分稳定。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">One result of that evening was that Jean had lost all desire to dabble with mysteries at the borders of known science. The naive and uncritical wonder that had drawn her to Rupert and his experiments had completely vanished. Perhaps she had been convinced and wanted no more proof: George preferred not to ask her. It was just as likely that the cares of maternity had banished such interests from her mind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="自从那个晚上之后，简再也不把那些神秘现象当作自己的兴趣了。当初是那种单纯、不加批判的神奇感使她和鲁柏特成了好朋友，因而经常参加他的实验。现在，这种神奇感没有了，也许她已经相信了，不再需要任何证据了，乔治不想去问她，再一种可能就是对孩子的爱使她忘了自己的兴趣爱好。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was no point, George knew, in worrying about a mystery that could never be solved, yet sometimes in the stillness of the night he would wake and wonder. He remembered his meeting with Jan Rodericks on the roof of Rupert's house, and the few words that were all he had spoken with the only human being successfully to defy the Overlords' ban. Nothing in the realm of the supernatural, thought George, could be more eerie than the plain scientific fact that though almost ten years had passed since he had spoken to Jan, that now-far-distant voyager would have aged by only a few days.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="乔治知道去琢磨一个无法揭开的谜团毫无意义，但有时在静静的夜里，他会突然醒来想这样的事。他回想起自己在鲁柏特房顶上同扬·罗德维克斯见面的情形以及彼此简短的对话，现在扬已经是第一个站出来挑战外星人的人。超自然世界最神奇的也莫过于自己和扬的见面已经过去将近二十年了，而旅途中的扬才刚过了几天。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The universe was vast, but that fact terrified him less than its mystery. George was not a person who thought deeply on such matters, yet sometimes it seemed to him that men were like children amusing themselves in some secluded playground, protected from the fierce realities of the outer world. Jan Rodricks had resented that protection and had escaped from it -- into no one knew what. But in this matter George found himself on the side of the Overlords. He had no wish to face whatever lurked in the unknown darkness, just beyond the little circle of light cast by the lamp of Science.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="宇宙很大，事实本身远没有它的神秘感更让人害怕。乔治在这类问题上不能想得很透彻，有时他觉得人类就像小孩一样，在家长的看护下，躲在操场偏僻的角落里自得其乐。扬已经逃离了让他反感的那种保护，进入了一个完全未知的世界。在这件事情上，乔治和外星人观点一致，他不愿意去面对科学之灯照亮的那个小光圈之外的未知黑暗世界。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"How is it?" said George plaintively, "that Jeff's always off somewhere when I happen to be home? Where's he gone today?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Jean looked up from her knitting -- an archaic occupation which had recently been revived with much success. Such fashions came and went on the island with some rapidity. The main result of this particular craze was that the men had now all been presented with multi-coloured sweaters, far too hot to wear in the daytime but quite useful after sundown.</div>

<div class="line_en">George had never caught anything, and the fish in the lagoon were much too wily to be trapped. Jean was just going to point this out when the stillness of the afternoon was shattered by a sound that still had power, even in this peaceful age, to chill the blood and set the scalp crawling with apprehension. It was the wail of a siren, rising and filling, spreading its message of danger in concentric circles out to sea.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="乔治从来没有捉到过任何鱼，那儿的鱼太机灵不容易逮到。简正想给乔治指出这一点，突然响起的一种声音划破了下午的宁静，在这个和平的年代，这种声音依然使人血液凝固，头皮发紧。警报声！这种凄厉的声音起伏着，把危险的信号从岛上送到附近的海域。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For almost a hundred years the stresses had been slowly increasing, here in the burning darkness deep beneath the ocean's floor. Though the submarine canyon had been formed geological ages ago, the tortured rocks had never reconciled themselves to their new positions. Countless times the strata had creaked and shifted, as the unimaginable weight of water disturbed their precarious equilibrium. They were ready to move again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="近百年来，小岛附近海底地层深处的压力一直在慢慢增加，尽管海底峡谷在几个地质时代前就形成了，但那些饱受压力的石头从来没有屈服过它们新的位置，地层无数次裂开、移动，巨大的水压破坏了它们薄弱的平衡。如今它们又要活动了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The day was quiet and peaceful. There was not a breath of wind, and even the perpetual muttering beyond the reef had sunk to a sullen undertone. A blazing sun hung half-way down the sky, but Jeff's mahogany-brown body was now quite immune to its onslaughts.</div>

<div class="line_en">Jeff was exploring the rock pools along the narrow Spartan beach -- an occupation he found endlessly absorbing. One never knew what exotic creatures one might find, sheltered here from the waves that marched forever across the Pacific to spend themselves against the reef. It was a fairyland for any child, and at the moment he possessed it all himself, for his friends had gone up into the hills.</div>

<div class="line_en">Swifter than any tide could ebb, the water was receding from the shore. Jeff watched, deeply puzzled and not in the least afraid, as the wet sands were uncovered and lay sparkling in the sun. He followed the retreating ocean, determined to make the most of whatever miracle had opened up the underwater world for his inspection. Now the level had sunk so far that the broken mast of the old wreck was climbing into the air, its weeds hanging limply from it as they lost their liquid support. Jeff hastened forward, eager to see what wonders would be uncovered next.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="海水退潮般飞快地落了下去，露出湿漉漉的沙滩。杰弗吃惊地望着，一点也不害怕。他追随着潮水，想看个究竟。帆船的断桅露出了水面，海草没有了水的支持，耷拉着。他加快脚步往前走，急于要揭开这个谜团。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Very firmly, something took hold of the beach and gave it a single, sudden jerk. The tremor passed so swiftly that Jeff wondered if he had imagined it. Perhaps it was a momentary giddiness, for all around him remained utterly unchanged. The waters of the lagoon were unruffled, the sky empty of cloud or menace. And then a very strange thing began to happen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然，海滩好像被一股无形的力量抓住了，猛烈地摇晃了一下，但晃动很快就消失了，杰弗觉得那种感觉很不真实，周围的一切都没有丝毫变化，水面依然风平浪静，天上依然一尘不染，没有任何危险征兆，也许只是自己有点眩晕。这时，一件怪事发生了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The beach here was a narrow belt of sand, sloping steeply towards the lagoon. Looking down into the glass-clear water, Jeff could see the submerged rocks which were as familiar to him as any formations on the land. About ten metres down, the weed-covered ribs of an ancient schooner curved up towards the world it had left almost two centuries ago. Jeff and his friends had often explored the wreck, but their hopes of hidden treasure had been disappointed. All that they had ever retrieved was a barnacle-encrusted compass.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="海滩又窄又陡，通过清澈如镜的海水，水下的石头历历在目，对杰弗来说，它们就和地面上的东西一样熟悉。十米之外躺着一艘大约两百年前沉没的古帆船，船身上爬满了海草。杰弗经常和小伙伴们到船里去探险，寻找隐藏的财宝，结果大失所望，只找到了一只爬满小螺蛳的指南针。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a sucking, gurgling sound, as of a river racing through a narrow channel. It was the voice of the reluctantly retreating sea, angry at losing, even for a moment, the lands it rightfully possessed. Through the graceful branches of the coral, through the hidden submarine caves, millions of tons of water were draining out of the lagoon into the vastness of the Pacific.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就像河水被吸入一条狭窄的水道发出的汩汩声，那是大海不甘心撤退的声音，是为暂时失去自己领地发怒的声音。数百万吨的水冲过珊瑚丛，冲过隐藏的海底洞穴，从水坑中撤出，流进了太平洋。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was then that he noticed the sound from the reef. He had never heard anything like it before, and he stopped to think the matter over, his bare feet slowly sinking into the moist sand. A great fish was thrashing in its death agonies a few metres away, but Jeff scarcely noticed it. He stood, alert and listening, while the noise from the reef grew steadily around him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此时，他听到礁石传来的声音不再熟悉，便停下脚步琢磨着是怎么回事，一双光脚陷在又湿又软的沙里。一条大鱼在几米外垂死挣扎着，杰弗也没看到，他警觉地站着，听着，那声音持续不断地在四周响起。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One of the salvage parties, hours later, found Jeff on a great block of coral that had been hurled twenty metres above the normal water level. He did not seem particularly frightened, though he was upset over the loss of his bicycle. He was also very hungry, as the partial destruction of the causeway had cut him off from home. When rescued he was contemplating swimming back to Athens, and, unless the currents had changed drastically, would doubtless have managed the crossing without much trouble.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="几个小时后，打捞队在一块被海浪抛到离水面二十米高的珊瑚石上找到杰弗，他看上去很镇定，只是伤心自行车丢了。他肚子饿了，但部分堤岸倒塌，他回不了家，正打算游回去。如果水流变化不那么快，完全可能游过去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">That wasn't true, of course, for the conference began immediately they had left the nursery. It decided nothing, but it had two sequels. The next day, without telling George, Jean took her small son to the Colony's child psychologist. He listened carefully while Jeff repeated his story, not in the least over-awed by his novel surroundings. Then, while his unsuspecting patient rejected seriatim the toys in the next room, the doctor reassured Jean.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当然，这并不完全是真话。夫妻俩一离开孩子的房间，就讨论起来了，最终什么结果也没有，但他们却有了各自的打算。第二天，简没有告诉乔治就带着儿子去看了儿童心理专家。杰弗一点也不怕生，又把故事重复了一遍，医生仔细听着。等杰弗到隔壁房间扔玩具玩儿的时候，医生对简说：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That's right -- it just wasn't there. So I started running again, and that's when I nearly burnt my feet, because the path was awful hot. The water hissed when it went over it, but it couldn't catch me then -- I was too far up the cliff. And that's all. I came down again when there weren't any more waves. Then I found that my bike had gone, and the road home had been knocked down."</div>

<div class="line_en">That evening, Jean passed the verdict on to her husband. He did not seem as relieved as she had hoped, and she put it down to worry over the damage to his beloved theatre. He just grunted "That's fine," and settled down with the current issue of Stage and Studio. It looked as if he had lost interest in the whole affair, and Jean felt vaguely annoyed with him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="晚上，简把医生的诊断书拿给丈夫看，他没有像预料的那样松一口气。简放下诊断书，问他是不是剧院在海啸中损失惨重，他只嘟哝了一声“很好”，就坐下看新的一期《舞台与制作室》去了，似乎对整个事情漠不关心。简很生气。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"There's nothing on his card to suggest any mental abnormality. You must remember that he's been through a terrifying experience, and he's come out of it remarkably well.

<div class="line_en">But three weeks later, on the first day that the causeway was reopened, George and his bicycle set off briskly towards Sparta. The beach was still littered with masses of shattered coral, and in one place the reef itself seemed to have been breached. George wondered how long it would take the myriads of patient polyps to repair the damage.</div>

<div class="line_en">For a long time George Greggson stood on that lonely track, staring at the patch of fused rock beneath his feet. He tried to tell himself that it was some freak of the long-dead volcano, but soon abandoned this attempt at self-deception. His mind went back to that night, years ago, when he and Jean had joined that silly experiment of Rupert Boyce's. No one had ever really understood what had happened then, and George knew that in some unfathomable way these two strange events were linked together. First it had been Jean, now her son. He did not know whether to be glad or fearful, and in his heart he uttered a silent prayer:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="乔治在那条偏僻的小道上站了很久，望着脚下那一摊熔化的石头，他想说服自己这只是死火山的奇特现象，但这显然是在自欺欺人。他想起多年前自己和简参加鲁柏特那场游戏的晚上，当时没有人知道究竟发生了什么事，但乔治知道这两件事肯定有着某种必然的联系，最初是简，现在是儿子，他不知道该高兴，还是该害怕，只是在心中默默祷告着：">查看中文翻译</div>
