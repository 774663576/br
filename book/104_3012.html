<div class="line_en">When, through decorations of light and shade, we drove up to 14 Thayer Street, a grave little lad met us with the keys and a note from Gaston who had rented the house for us. My Lo, without granting her new surroundings one glance, unseeingly turned on the radio to which instinct led her and lay down on the living room sofa with a batch of old magazines which in the same precise and blind manner she landed by dipping her hand into the nether anatomy of a lamp table.</div>

<div class="line_en">I really did not mind where to dwell provided I could lock my Lolita up somewhere; but I had, I suppose, in the course of my correspondence with vague Gaston, vaguely visualized a house of ivied brick. Actually the place bore a dejected resemblance to the Haze home (a mere 400 miles distant): it was the same sort of dull gray frame affair with a shingled roof and dull green drill awnings; and the rooms, though smaller and furnished in a more consistent plush-and-plate style, were arranged in much the same order. My study turned out to be, however, a much larger room, lined from floor to ceiling with some two thousand books on chemistry which my landlord (on sabbatical leave for the time being) taught at Beardsley College.</div>

<div class="line_en">At my first interview with headmistress Pratt, she approved of my child's "nice blue eyes" (blue! Lolita!) and of my own friendship with that "French genius" (a genius! Gaston!)-- and then, having turned Dolly over to a Miss Cormorant, she wrinkled her brow in a kind of recueillement and said:</div>

<div class="line_en">I had hoped Beardsley School for girls, an expensive day school, with lunch thrown in and a glamorous gymnasium, would, while cultivating all those young bodies, provide some formal education for their minds as well. Gaston Godin, who was seldom right in his judgment of American habitus, had warned me that the institution might turn out to be one of those where girls are taught, as he put it with a foreigner's love for such things: "not to spell very well, but to smell very well." I don't think they achieved even that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我希望比尔兹利女子学校是所昂贵的日校，能额外赠送午饭，有完善的体育馆，在锻炼所有这些年轻身体的同时，也能对她们的智力给予正规教育。加期东·戈丁对美国情形的判断很少正确，曾提醒我这所教育机构很可能放出的女学生都象他以一个外国人对这类事情的好恶所评价的：“拼写不必太好，但嗅觉必须灵敏。”我认为她们甚至还没有这种成绩。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"We are not so much concerned, Mr. Humbird, with having our students become bookworms or be able to reel off all the capitals of Europe which nobody knows anyway, or learn by heart the dates of forgotten battles. What we are concerned with is the adjustment of the child to group life. This is why we stress the four D's: Dramatics, Dance, Debating and Dating. We are confronted by certain facts. Your delightful Dolly will presently enter an age group where dates, dating, date dress, date book, date etiquette, mean as much to her as, say, business, business connections, business success, mean to you, or as much as [smiling] the happiness of my girls means to me. Dorothy Humbird is already involved in a whole system of social life which consists, whether we like it or not, of hot-dog stands, corner drugstores, malts and cokes, movies, square-dancing, blanket parties on beaches, and even hair-fixing parties! Naturally at Beardsley School we disapprove of some of these activities; and we rechannel others into more constructive directions. But we do try to turn our backs on the fog and squarely face the sunshine. To put it briefly, while adopting certain teaching techniques, we are more interested in communication than in composition. That is, with due respect to Shakespeare and others, we want our girls to communicate freely with the live world around them rather than plunge into musty old books. We are still groping perhaps, but we grope intelligently, like a gynecologist feeling a tumor. We think, Dr. Humburg, in organismal and organizational terms. We have done away with the mass of irrelevant topics that have traditionally been presented to young girls, leaving no place, in former days, for the knowledges and the skills, and the attitudes they will need in managing their lives and -- as the cynic might add -- the lives of their husbands. Mr. Humberson, let us put it this way: the position of a star is important, but the most practical spot for an icebox in the kitchen may be even more important to the budding housewife. You say that all you expect a child to obtain from school is a sound education. But what do we mean by education? In the old days it was in the main a verbal phenomenon; I mean, you could have a child learn by heart a good encyclopedia and he or she would know as much as or more than a school could offer. Dr. Hummer, do you realize that for the modern pre-adolescent child, medieval dates are of less vital value than weekend ones [twinkle]?-- to repeat a pun that I heard the Beardsley college psychoanalyst permit herself the other day. We live not only in a world of thoughts, but also in a world of things. Words without experience are meaningless. What on earth can Dorothy Hummerson care for Greece and the Orient with their harems and slaves?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“亨伯德先生，我们并不急于让我们的学生变成书呆子或能够脱口说出和写出谁也记不住的所有欧洲首都，或牢记那些已被遗忘的历次战争的年代。我们关心的是儿童适应群体生活的能力。因此我们要强调四个“D”：戏剧、舞蹈、辩论和约会。我们面临许多特定的问题。你快活的多丽很快将编入的那个年龄组，对她来说约会、赴约、约会服装、约会书籍、约会礼节意义重大，就如同，比如说商业、商业联系、商业成功之于你的意义，或我的女孩子们的幸福之于我的意义。多萝西·亨伯德已经卷入了社会生活的总系统，不管我们喜欢与否，那系统都包括热狗摊、街角的药房、麦芽糖和可乐，电影，方步舞、海滨毛毯会，甚至还有发式观摩会！当然，比尔兹利学校是禁止其中几项活动的；另一方面我们也引导其余的进入更富建设性的方向。但我们确实是尽量漠视云雾，直接面对阳光。简单说，我们采取的教育手段对交流思想比对写作技巧更感兴趣。就是说，我们敬仰莎士比亚和其它事物。我们要求我们的女孩子们自由地与周围活生生的世界交流，而不是一头扎进发霉的故纸堆里。或许我们仍是在摸索，但我们是理智地摸索着，象妇科医生诊断肿瘤一样。亨伯格先生，我们是以生物体和社会团体的观点进行思维的。我们已经清除了传统上是赠给年轻女子的大量无关紧要的格言，这些格言很早就显出与她们将来主宰自己的生活——愤世嫉俗者还会加上一句——以及她的丈夫的生活所需要的知识、技能和态度格格不人。亨伯森先生，我们这么说吧：一颗星球的位置固然重要，但冰箱摆在厨房里最实用的地方对于未来的家庭主妇也许更重要。你说你希望女孩从学校获得的一切就是扎扎实实的教育。但我们所讲的教育意味着什么？过去，它主要是口头形式的；我是说，你可以叫孩子背下一部百科全书，他或她能消化学校所能给予的一切知识，甚至更多。亨莫博士，你是否想到，中世纪的约会形式对于现代青春期少年已不如如今的周末约会有生命力（霎眼）？——说句玩笑，我听说比尔兹利大学的精神分析学家数日前还允许自己约会了一次。我们不仅生活在思想的世界，还活在物质的世界。不经实践的言辞是空洞的。多萝西·亨莫森怎么能对希腊和东方人的奴隶和妾室感兴趣呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This program rather appalled me, but I spoke to two intelligent ladies who had been connected with the school, and they affirmed that the girls did quite a bit of sound reading and that the "communication" line was more or less ballyhoo aimed at giving old-fashioned Beardsley School a financially remunerative modern touch, though actually it remained as prim as a prawn.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这场演出令我甚为惊奇，但我对两位和学校有关的聪慧女士谈时，她们都断言女孩子的读书之风确实很盛，所谓“交流”的原则多少近于大吹大擂，目的是给旧式的比尔兹利学校增添些许现代特征，尽管实际上它仍一本正经如同对虾一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Another reason attracting me to that particular school may seem funny to some readers, but it was very important to me, for that is the way I am made. Across our street, exactly in front of our house, there was, I noticed, a gap of weedy wasteland, with some colorful bushes and a pile of bricks and a few scattered planks, and the foam of shabby mauve and chrome autumn roadside flowers; and through that gap you could see a shimmery section of School Rd., running parallel to our Thayer St., and immediately beyond that, the playground of the school. Apart from the psychological comfort this general arrangement should afford me by keeping Dolly's day adjacent to mine, I immediately foresaw the pleasure I would have in distinguishing from my study-bedroom, by means of powerful binoculars, the statistically inevitable percentage of nymphets among the other girl-children playing around Dolly during recess; unfortunately, on the very first day of school, workmen arrived and put up a fence some way down the gap, and in no time a construction of tawny wood maliciously arose beyond that fence utterly blocking my magic vista; and as soon as they had erected a sufficient amount of material to spoil everything, those absurd builders suspended their work and never appeared again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这所学校吸引我的第二个原因说来一些读者可能觉得好笑，对我却很重要，因为我就是这么长大的。街对面，就在我们屋子的前边，我注意到有一条长满野草的荒沟，还有些五颜六色的灌木丛、一堆砖头和零星几块厚木板，以及低质的淡紫色泡沫和镀铬的秋天路边花；从那条沟恰巧能看见与塞耶街平行的一条微亮的学校小径，紧挨着着就是学校运动场。除了心理上的舒适以外，这种错落有致可使多丽的一天与我自己紧密相连，我立刻预见到我将拥有的乐趣：通过高倍数双筒望远镜，我能从书房兼卧室欣赏课间休息时在多丽周围玩耍的其她女孩子，能按统计学的方法，分辨出她们中间性感少女的比例；不幸的是，就在开学的第一天，工人们来了，在离沟不远的地方修了围墙，不久，一座黄褐色木制建筑又在围墙外边立了起来，完全挡住了我的幻境；但当他们刚刚装上足以破坏一切的材料以后，那些荒唐的建筑工又宣告暂停，再未露面。">查看中文翻译</div>
