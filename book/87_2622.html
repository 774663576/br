<div class="line_en">Jill stood at the edge of a yawning, open pit in the dank tunnel, staring helplessly at the door on the other side. The pit was too wide to safely jump and there was no way to climb down, at least none that she could see. She'd have to go back and try the door by the ladder. Her frustrated sigh turned into a shiver. The damp chill emanating from the stone walls would have been bad enough without her being dripping wet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="潮湿的坑道中间，有一个巨大的洞穴好像张开了血盆大口，吉尔就站在洞穴的边缘，正无计可施地望着对面的那道门。洞穴实在有些太大，想要平安跳过去好像有些勉强，难道说要从这边下去得从那边爬上去？可是这个洞看上去深不见底。看来只能后退，去试试那个旁边有梯子的门了。焦急的叹气变成了使身体颤抖的呼吸，从岩壁上所散发出来的潮湿的冷空气弥漫在四周，可是身体却并没有强烈的感觉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It didn't matter, since she didn't have whatever tool it required, it was as good as a dead end. Besides, it was unlikely that whoever she'd seen walking through the waterfall had managed to get across.</div>

<div class="line_en">A glint of metal caught her gaze as she turned, feet squelching in her boots. She peered down at it, brushing a wet strand of hair out of her eyes. It was a small iron plate set into the stone, a six-sided hole about the size of a quarter at the center. She looked back at the door thoughtfully.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="正当吉尔转身要走时，一个金属的光泽闪进了她的视线。于是她急忙拨开散在前额的头发，仔观察那块金属。原来有一块小小的铜板镶嵌的岩石里，中间有一块硬币大小的六角形小孔。吉尔若有所思地回望对面的那扇巴。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jill walked back through the twisting passage toward the entrance to the tunnel, still in awe of what she'd found behind the curtain of water. It appeared that there was a whole network of tunnels running beneath the estate. The walls were rough and uneven, chunks of sandy limestone protruding at odd angles-but the sheer amount of work that had gone into creating the underground path was mind-boggling.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔对于自己在瀑布后面所发现的东西抱有一种难以言喻的畏惧，于是又转过身番回坑道的入口，在那里走向这块私有领地的地下。两侧的墙壁都是自然形成的大块石灰岩，形态各异，以各种奇怪的角度向外突出。看上去就好像是一座令人大吃一惊的建筑物。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She reached the metal door next to the ladder, having to make a conscious effort not to let her teeth chatter as a cold draft swept down from the courtyard above. The sound of the waterfall was strangely muted. The steady, echoing rhythm of water dripping to the rock floor was much louder, giving the tunnels a somewhat medieval feel…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="来到梯子旁边的那道门前，从头上的中庭所吹来的冷风让人感到一阵刺骨的冰冷。此时瀑布的声音已经奇怪地变小，只剩下水滴还不断地滴在岩床上发出富有节奏的声音。水滴的回声在坑道里回响着…">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="两个人紧张地倾听，吉尔在岩幵的回廊中四处张望，在心里想巴瑞刚才听到了什么动静。在另一侧的尽头有一道金属门，上方有简易的照明设备投下了昏暗的灯光。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Before she could ask any questions, he turned and faced her, smiling uneasily. "Look, I'm sorry I didn't wait for you, but I heard somebody walking out in the garden and had to take a look. I found this place by accident, kind of tripped and fell in… anyway. I'm glad you're here. Let's check around, see what we can dig up."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="还没等吉尔发问，巴瑞转过身来，脸上露出了不安的笑容。“啊，不好意思，我没有等你。但是，我在中庭听到了脚步声，我就想先去调查一下。于是偶然就发现了这个地方，然后…就是这么回事。能在这里遇到你真是太好了。那么我们在这里调查一下吧，没准能找到些什么重要的东西呢。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Rebecca was going through an old trunk pushed against one wall of the room they'd entered, shuffling through stacks of papers and frowning while Chris checked out the rest of the room. A single, rumpled cot, a desk, and a towering, ancient bookshelf were the only other pieces of furniture. After the cold, alien splendor of the mansion, Chris was absurdly grateful to be in simpler surroundings.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="瑞贝卡走向摆在房间墙角处的旧文件箱，一边看着文件一边皱起了眉头，克里斯则在房间其他的地方进行着搜索。破旧的单人床、书桌、还有个天花板那么高的大书架，这就是房间里的全部摆设。在看过了别墅中那超然脱俗而又异常华丽的修饰之后，眼前的这种简朴风格看上去就有些寒酸的感觉。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They'd come to a house at the end of the long, winding path from the courtyard, much smaller and infinitely less intimidating than the mansion.

In close proximity to humans, it uses tentacular, prehen-sile vines to entrap its prey while leechlike adap-tations latch onto exposed skin and draw fatal quantities of blood; several members of the staff have already fallen victim to this.'

<div class="line_en">Since they'd left the house, he'd finally started to feel like things were going in his favor. He'd remembered the underground room near the entrance to the labs, and was almost certain that the wolf medal would be there. And the tunnels were clear. He had expected the 121s to be out, but apparently no one had messed with the passage mechanisms since the accident. They'd split up to search for the lever that worked the passages and it had been in plain sight, propped up next to the very mechanism that it controlled.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们两个离开别墅之后，威斯克终于觉得整件事再次按照自己的设想那样开始运作了。他想起在通往研究所的入口附近有一间地下室。狼的徽章应该就在那里。坑道里是安全的，很明显自从事故发生之后，就没有人改动过信道中的机关装置。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Wesker sighed inwardly. If it wasn't one thing, it was another. In truth, this whole aifair had been a massive headache from the beginning. At least the underground security hadn't been activated -- though he'd had no way of knowing that until they'd reached the tunnels, and having dragged Barry along as insur-ance, he now had to deal with the consequences. If the money wasn't so good.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="威斯克轻轻地叹了口气。实际上这次的这份工作的确是让人十分头疼的那种。至，应付地下安全的对策完全无效——虽然在我们进入坑道之间根本不知道会发生什么事情。也正因为这样，为了保障我的安全就要把巴瑞带在身边，而现在就面临看一个重要的局面。妈的，要不是看在钱的份上…">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Everything would have been perfect, except goddamned Enrico Marini had wandered along, happening across a very important paper that Wesker had accidentally dropped -- his orders, straight from the head of White Umbrella.

<div class="line_en">Wesker stepped back quickly, reaching for the lever with the six-sided tip that he'd left next to the generator. He watched Barry for a few seconds longer, saw the sag in the big man's shoulders, the submissive hang of his head. Satisfied, Wesker turned and walked out of the room. On the very slight chance that any of the S. T. A. R. S. made it to the lab, Mr. Burton would ensure that there wouldn't be any more trouble. He hurried back through the entrance tunnel, silently congratulating himself on getting things back under control as he headed toward the first passage mechanism. He'd have to move fast from here on out; there were a few things he'd neglected to mention to Barry -- like the experimental security detachment that would be released into the tunnels once he turned that lever for the first time…</div>
