<div class="line_en">Then yesterday in my science elective, we were doing this cool mystery-powder investigation where we had to classify a substance as an acid or a base. Everyone had to heat their mystery powders on a heating plate and make observations, so we were all huddled around the powders with our notebooks. Now, there are eight kids in the elective, and seven of them were squished together on one side of the plate while one of them -- me -- had loads of room on the other side. So of course I noticed this, but I was hoping Ms. Rubin wouldn't notice this, because I didn't want her to say something. But of course she did notice this, and of course she said something.</div>

<div class="line_en">I noticed not too long ago that even though people were getting used to me, no one would actually touch me. I didn't realize this at first because it's not like kids go around touching each other that much in middle school anyway. But last Thursday in dance class, which is, like, my least favorite class, Mrs. Atanabi, the teacher, tried to make Ximena Chin be my dance partner. Now, I've never actually seen someone have a "panic attack" before, but I have heard about it, and I'm pretty sure Ximena had a panic attack at that second. She got really nervous and turned pale and literally broke into a sweat within a minute, and then she came up with some lame excuse about really having to go to the bathroom. Anyway, Mrs. Atanabi let her off the hook, because she ended up not making anyone dance together.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在不久前我才注意到，虽然大家习惯了我的存在，但是没有人真正愿意触碰到我。我一开始没意识到这一点，因为毕竟这是初中，大家不会像小孩子那样随处走动，你敲我打。但是在周四的舞蹈课上——貌似这是我最不喜欢的课了——舞蹈老师安塔娜比太太想让西蒙娜·陈做我的舞伴。我从来没有亲眼见过患有“恐慌症”的人，只是听说过，但那一刻，我敢肯定西蒙娜受到了“恐慌症”的袭击。她惊恐万分，脸色煞白，不到一分钟就大汗淋漓，然后她找了一个站不住脚的理由，说一定要去上厕所。总之，安塔娜比太太放了她一马，因为她最后再也没有让大家配对跳舞。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Tristan!" yelled Ms. Rubin, but Tristan didn't even care about the spilled powder on the floor or that he ruined the experiment. What he was most concerned about was getting to the lab sink to wash his hands as fast as possible. That's when I knew for sure that there was this thing about touching me at Beecher Prep.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“特里斯坦！”鲁宾小姐叫了起来，但特里斯坦甚至都没去管洒了一地的粉末，也顾不上破坏了整个实验。他最关心的是冲到实验室水槽边，把手洗干净，越快越好。在那一刻我才清楚地知道，在毕彻预科学校，有一种事件叫“碰到我”。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Guys, there's plenty of room on that side. Tristan, Nino, go over there," she said, so Tristan and Nino scooted over to my side. Tristan and Nino have always been okay-nice to me. I want to go on record as saying that. Not super-nice, like they go out of their way to hang out with me, but okay-nice, like they say hello to me and talk to me like normal. And they didn't even make a face when Ms. Rubin told them to come on my side, which a lot of kids do when they think I'm not looking. Anyway, everything was going fine until Tristan's mystery powder started melting. He moved his foil off the plate just as my powder began to melt, too, which is why I went to move mine off the plate, and then my hand accidentally bumped his hand for a fraction of a second. Tristan jerked his hand away so fast he dropped his foil on the floor while also knocking everyone else's foil off the heating plate.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“孩子们，那边地方大着呢，特里斯坦，尼诺，站到那边去。”她说。于是特里斯坦和尼诺挪了过来。特里斯坦和尼诺一直对我不错。往明里说，不是友好到毫不避嫌地跟我一起玩，而是不错，比如他们会跟我打招呼，像对待普通人那样跟我寒暄几句。当鲁宾小姐叫他们站到我这边时，他们甚至都没有做鬼脸——许多同学以为我没注意时就会那么做。总之，一切都算正常，直到特里斯坦的神秘粉末开始融化。正当他把箔片从加热板移走的时候，我的粉末也开始融化了，于是我也动手把箔片从加热板上取了下来。就在这时，我的手不小心碰到了他的手。特里斯坦猛地一甩手，动作之快，把箔片甩到了地板上，这样所有人的箔片和加热板都被撞翻了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I think it's like the Cheese Touch in Diary of a Wimpy Kid. The kids in that story were afraid they'd catch the cooties if they touched the old moldy cheese on the basketball court. At Beecher Prep, I'm the old moldy cheese.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我觉得这有点像《小屁孩日记》里的“奶酪附体”。在那个故事里，孩子们很害怕在篮球场上碰到发霉的奶酪，因为会被霉运附体。在毕彻预科学校，我就是那块发霉的“千年奶酪”。">查看中文翻译</div>
