<div class="line_en">The chamber was lit only by candlelight and a dying fire. Kohler was near the fireplace, standing awkwardly in front of his wheelchair. He brandished a pistol, aimed at the camerlegno, who lay on the floor at his feet, writhing in agony. The camerlegno's cassock was torn open, and his bare chest was seared black. Langdon could not make out the symbol from across the room, but a large, square brand lay on the floor near Kohler. The metal still glowed red.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="房间裡的照明只有蜡烛和一堆将熄的炉火。寇勒靠近壁炉，笨拙地站在他的轮椅前。他挥舞著一把手枪，瞄准了总司库，而总司库则面朝下倒在地上，痛苦得蜷缩著身子。总司库的长袍撕开来，赤裸的胸膛上烙得焦黑。兰登在房间这头看不清上面的符号，但寇勒旁边的地板上有个很大的、四方形的烙印铁模，那块金属仍发著红光。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Two of the Swiss Guards acted without hesitation. They opened fire. The bullets smashed into Kohler's chest, driving him backward. Kohler collapsed into his wheelchair, his chest gurgling blood. His gun went skittering across the floor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两名瑞士卫兵毫不犹豫就展开行动。他们开了枪，子弹击中寇勒的胸部，把他往后轰倒。寇勒垮在轮椅上，胸膛汩汩冒出血来，他的手枪滑到地板上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Langdon felt delirious as he moved across the room. Through a mist of insanity and violence, he tried to make sense of what he was seeing. A crippled scientist, in a final act of symbolic dominance, had flown into Vatican City and branded the church's highest official. Some things are worth dying for, the Hassassin had said. Langdon wondered how a handicapped man could possibly have overpowered the camerlegno. Then again, Kohler had a gun. It doesn't matter how he did it! Kohler accomplished his mission!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登走过房间，觉得自己精神错乱了。在一片模糊的疯狂和暴力中，他想搞清楚自己眼前所见。一个双足瘫痪的科学家，在最后一个象徵性的支配行动中，飞到了梵蒂冈城，为教会最高官员烙印。有些事情值得牺牲性命。那个哈撒辛说过。兰登想不透一个双腿残障的男人怎麽可能制伏总司库，不过寇勒有枪。他怎麽做的并不重要！寇勒完成他的任务了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You bastard," Rocher said, running at him. "You sanctimonious bas --"</div>

<div class="line_en">The camerlegno, still twisting on the floor, rolled toward Rocher, and with the trancelike terror of the early witch hunts, pointed his index finger at Rocher and yelled a single word. "ILLUMINATUS!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="仍然蜷缩在地板上的总司库朝罗榭转过去，脸上带著早年猎女巫般恍惚的恐惧，食指直直指著罗榭，只喊了一个词：「光明会员！」">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This time it was Chartrand who reacted on instinct, putting three bullets in Rocher's back. The captain fell face first on the tile floor and slid lifeless through his own blood. Chartrand and the guards dashed immediately to the camerlegno, who lay clutching himself, convulsing in pain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这回凭直觉反应的是夏特朗，他朝罗榭的背部开了三枪。上尉脸朝下倒在瓷砖地板上，死沉沉跌在自己的血泊中。夏特朗和另外一名卫兵立刻衝向总司库，而总司库正痛苦抽搐著，紧抓住自己的身体。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Both guards let out exclamations of horror when they saw the symbol seared on the camerlegno's chest. The second guard saw the brand upside down and immediately staggered backward with fear in his eyes. Chartrand, looking equally overwhelmed by the symbol, pulled the camerlegno's torn cassock up over the burn, shielding it from view.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两名卫兵看到总司库胸膛上烙印的符号，都不禁惊骇得大喊出声。第二个卫兵上下颠倒看到那个烙印，立刻踉跄后退，双眼充满恐惧。夏特朗同样被那个符号震惊得不知所措，他把总司库破掉的长袍拉起来盖住那个灼伤，免得让人看到。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Langdon knelt beside Kohler and reached for the object. The metal still radiated heat. Grasping the wooden handle, Langdon picked it up. He was not sure what he expected to see, but it most certainly was not this.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登脆在寇勒旁边，伸手去拿那个模子。金属仍发著热，兰登抓住木製把手，拿了起来。他不确定自己期待看到什麽，但绝对不会是眼前这个。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Langdon moved toward the gruesome scene. The camerlegno was being attended, and Langdon felt himself drawn toward the smoking brand on the floor near Kohler's wheelchair. The sixth brand? The closer Langdon got, the more confused he became. The brand seemed to be a perfect square, quite large, and had obviously come from the sacred center compartment of the chest in the Illuminati Lair. A sixth and final brand, the Hassassin had said. The most brilliant of all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登移向那个可怕的场景。瑞士卫兵正在照顾总司库，兰登不自觉被寇勒轮椅边地板上那块冒著烟的烙印模吸引过去。第六个烙印？兰登靠得愈近，就觉得愈困惑。那个烙印模似乎是正方形的，很大，而且显然原来是放在光明会祕密基地那个箱子裡中央的格子。第六个、也是最后的烙印，那个哈撒辛说过。最出色的一个。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Langdon stared a long, confused moment. Nothing was making sense. Why had the guards cried out in horror when they saw this? It was a square of meaningless squiggles. The most brilliant of all? It was symmetrical, Langdon could tell as he rotated it in his hand, but it was gibberish.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登困惑地瞪了好久。一切都说不通，为什麽卫兵们看到这个烙印时会惊骇大喊？这不过是个正方形，上头一堆无意义的弯曲短线。最出色的一个？兰登拿在手裡旋转，看得出那是个对称的图案，但上头是一堆鬼画符。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When he felt a hand on his shoulder, Langdon looked up, expecting Vittoria. The hand, however, was covered with blood. It belonged to Maximilian Kohler, who was reaching out from his wheelchair.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登感觉到一隻手放在他肩膀上，抬起头来，以为是薇多利雅。但那隻手上有血，是麦斯米伦．寇勒的血，他正坐在轮椅上伸出手来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Slumped in his wheelchair, the dying director was still breathing, albeit barely, sucking in sputtering gasps. Kohler's eyes met Langdon's, and it was the same stony gaze that had greeted Langdon at CERN earlier that day. The eyes looked even harder in death, the loathing and enmity rising to the surface.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="寇勒垮在轮椅上，这位垂死的院长还在呼吸，虽然很勉强，呼吸困难。寇勒的双眼和兰登的相遇，还是他今天早上在欧洲核子研究中心门口迎接兰登那种石头般的眼神，在垂死之际看起来更冷酷，浮现出憎恶和敌意。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"G-give…" Kohler's final words were a gurgling whisper. "G-give this… to the m-media." Kohler collapsed motionless, and the device fell in his lap.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="「把……」寇勒最后的遗言转为耳语，「把这个……给媒──媒──媒体。」寇勒垮下去一动也不动，那个小仪器落在他的膝盖上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The scientist's body quivered, and Langdon sensed he was trying to move. Everyone else in the room was focused on the camerlegno, and Langdon wanted to call out, but he could not react. He was transfixed by the intensity radiating from Kohler in these final seconds of his life. The director, with tremulous effort, lifted his arm and pulled a small device off the arm of his wheelchair. It was the size of a matchbox. He held it out, quivering. For an instant, Langdon feared Kohler had a weapon. But it was something else.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="寇勒的身体颤抖著，兰登感觉他正想移动。房间裡的其他人都在注意总司库，兰登想喊出声，却喊不出来。他被寇勒临终这几秒所散发的力量给吓呆了。寇勒颤抖著举起手臂，从轮椅扶手上拉下一个小仪器，像火柴盒那麽大。他递出去，手颤动著。一时之间，兰登很担心寇勒又拿了什麽武器。但那不是武器。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was the voice of the camerlegno that broke the silence. He was trying to sit up. "The cardinals," he gasped to Chartrand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="总司库的声音打破沉默。他想站起来。「枢机主教们。」他喘著气跟夏特朗说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Shocked, Langdon stared at the device. It was electronic. The wordsSONY RUVI were printed across the front. Langdon recognized it as one of those new ultraminiature, palm-held camcorders. The balls on this guy! he thought. Kohler had apparently recorded some sort of final suicide message he wanted the media to broadcast… no doubt some sermon about the importance of science and the evils of religion. Langdon decided he had done enough for this man's cause tonight. Before Chartrand saw Kohler's camcorder, Langdon slipped it into his deepest jacket pocket. Kohler's final message can rot in hell!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登震惊地瞪著那个仪器。那是个电子装置，正面印著新力RUVI的字样。兰登认得那是新款超迷你掌上型摄影机。这家伙可真有种！他心想。寇勒显然录下了什麽自杀遗言，希望媒体播放。裡面一定是宣传科学的重要性和宗教的邪恶。兰登觉得今天晚上他为这个男人做得已经够多了。趁夏特朗还没看到寇勒的摄影机之前，兰登把那个小仪器塞进自己的外套口袋裡。寇勒的遗言就留在地狱裡烂掉吧！">查看中文翻译</div>
