<div class="line_en">It was a long way to Sherwood Forest. Marian knew that it was not safe for a beautiful lady to travel so far by herself. She feared the robbers and the wild, wicked men she might meet. So she dressed herself like a knight all in shining armour. She wore a steel helmet, with a white feather. Over her lovely face she drew a steel visor, which knights used to wear. It kept the face from being hurt by arrows and swords in battle, and also, if a knight wished not to be known, it prevented people from seeing his face altogether.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到舍伍德森林路途遥远，玛丽安知道一个漂亮的姑娘孤身一人走那么远的路不安全。她担心自己可能会遇到强盗和凶恶的坏人。于是，她装扮成一个骑士，穿着闪亮的盔甲。她头戴钢盔，上面插在白色的羽毛。在她那可爱的脸上，她戴上一个钢面甲，这是过去骑士经常戴的。这样，在打仗时，可以防护脸部不被弓箭或剑伤到。而且，如果骑士不希望让人认出来，还可以让人完全看不见自己的脸。">查看中文翻译</div>
