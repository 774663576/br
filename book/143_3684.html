<div class="line_en">What a mailed fist this young man would be for Don Croce. What a warrior chief in the field. Don Croce forgave the fact that Guiliano was at present a thorn in his side. The two bandits imprisoned in Montelepre, the feared Passatempo and the clever Terranova, had been captured with the Don's approval and complicity. But all this could be forgiven, bygones were bygones; the Don never held a grudge that impaired his future profits. He would now track Turi Guiliano very carefully.</div>

<div class="line_en">Deep in the mountains, Guiliano had no knowledge of his growing fame. He was too busy making plans to build his power. His first problem was the two bandit chiefs, Terranova and Passatempo. He questioned them closely about their capture and came to the conclusion they had been betrayed, informed upon. They swore their men had been faithful and many had been killed in the trap. Guiliano pondered all this and came to the conclusion that the Mafia, which had acted as fences and go-betweens for the band, had betrayed them. When he mentioned this to the two bandits they refused to believe it. The Friends of the Friends would never break the sacred code of omerta which was so central to their own survival. Guiliano did not insist. Instead he made them a formal offer to join his band.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉里安诺待在山里，他并不知道自己的名气与日俱增。他正忙于谋划壮大自己的力量。他首先要解决的问题是如何对待泰拉诺瓦和帕萨藤珀。他仔细询问了他们被抓的经过，认为他们是遭到背叛，被人告密。他们两人发誓说手下的人都很忠诚，许多人死于警方的伏击。吉里安诺经过缜密考虑后得出的结论是，黑手党扮演了这伙人的保护神和联络员的角色，但却将他们出卖了。他把这个结论说给这两个人听，可是他们根本就不相信。友中友绝对不会违背神圣的“缄默规则”，因为这是他们的安身立命之本。吉里安诺没有坚持自己的意见，反而正式邀请他们入伙。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Don Croce was now fully aware of Turi Guiliano and full of admiration for him. What a true Mafioso youth. He meant the usage, of course, in the old traditional form: a Mafioso face, a Mafioso tree, a Mafioso woman, that is, a thing foremost in beauty in its particular form.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="唐·克罗切现在已经充分注意到图里·吉里安诺，而且十分钦佩他。真是个英武的青年啊！“英武”在西西里方言中并没有“黑手党”的意思，而是指以自己特有的形式表现出的非常之美，如一张英俊的脸、一棵挺拔的树、一个俊俏的女子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Passatempo, an old-fashioned bandit who believed in rape, small-time extortion and the murder of shepherds, immediately began pondering how he could profit by this association and then murder Guiliano and take his share of the loot. Terranova, who liked Guiliano and was more grateful for his rescue, wondered how he could tactfully steer this talented young bandit on a more prudent path. Guiliano was now looking at them with a little smile, as if he could read their minds and was amused by what they thought.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="帕萨藤珀是守旧的土匪，干点奸淫掳掠、勒索杀人的事。他立刻开始打起自己的算盘，如何才能在这样的联手中得到好处，怎样才能干掉吉里安诺，夺取他的那份财物。泰拉诺瓦比较喜欢吉里安诺，非常感激他的救命之恩，心里想着如何为这个富有才华的年轻人出谋划策，帮助他走上比较谨慎稳妥的道路。这时吉里安诺看着他们，脸上露出淡淡的微笑，好像看透了他们的心思，觉得他们的想法很有意思。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He explained that his purpose was not only to survive but to become a political force. He emphasized that they would not rob the poor. Indeed half of the profit the band earned would be distributed to the needy in the provinces around the town of Montelepre reaching to the suburbs of Palermo. Terranova and Passatempo would rule their own subordinate bands but would be under Guiliano's overall command. These subordinate bands would not launch any money-making expedition without Guiliano's approval. Together they would have absolute rule over the provinces that held the great city of Palermo, the city of Monreale, and the towns of Montelepre, Partinico and Corleone. He impressed upon them that they would take the offensive against the carabinieri. That it would be the field police who would go in fear of their lives, not the bandits. They were astonished by this bravado.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他解释说他的目的不只是为了生存，而是为了成为一支政治力量。他强调说他们不会去打劫穷人。相反，他们要把得来的东西分一半给蒙特莱普雷镇四周一直到巴勒莫郊区的穷人。泰拉诺瓦和帕萨藤珀仍将管理自己的旧部，但现在要服从吉里安诺的指挥。没有吉里安诺的同意，他们不能擅自进行任何打劫钱财的活动。他们联合之后将纵横于巴勒莫市、蒙雷阿莱市以及蒙特莱普雷、帕尔蒂尼科和柯里昂周围的乡村地区。他特别叮嘱他们要对宪兵主动出击。他说怕死的不是他们这些绿林好汉，而是那些在野外执行任务的警察。这两个人听了他的大胆计划后着实感到惊讶。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In the bright morning sunlight that lit their mountains with gold they all three listened to Guiliano, spellbound as he told how they would lead the fight to make Sicilians a free people, uplift the poor and destroy the power of the Mafia, the nobility and Rome. They would have laughed at anyone else, but they remembered what everyone who saw it would always remember: the Corporal of the carabinieri raising the pistol to Guiliano's head. The quiet stare of Guiliano, his absolute confidence that he would not die, as he waited for the Corporal to pull the trigger. The mercy he had shown to the Corporal after the pistol misfired. These were all acts of a man who believed in his own immortality and forced others to share that belief. And so now they stared at the handsome young man, and they were impressed by his beauty, his courage and his innocence.</div>

<div class="line_en">The next morning Guiliano led his three men, Aspanu Pisciotta, Passatempo and Terranova, down out of the mountains on a path that would let them out on the plains near the town of Castelvetrano. He came down very early to scout the ground. He and his men were dressed as laborers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天上午，吉里安诺带领阿斯帕努·皮肖塔、帕萨藤珀和泰拉诺瓦沿一条山路下山，准备到离卡斯特尔维特拉诺镇不远的平原地区去。他很早就下来看了地形。他和他们三个人都打扮成劳工的模样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He knew that truck convoys of foodstuffs passed by here on the way to bringing their wares to the markets of Palermo. The problem was how to get the trucks to stop. They would be going at high speed to foil hijackers and the drivers might be armed.</div>

<div class="line_en">Guiliano made his men hide in the underbrush of the road just outside Castelvetrano, then sat himself on a large white boulder in plain view. Men going out to work in the fields stared at him with stony faces. They saw the lupara he was carrying and hurried on. Guiliano wondered if any of them had recognized him. Then he saw a legend-painted large cart coming down the road, drawn by a single mule. The old man driving was known by sight to Guiliano. He was one of the line of professional carters so plentiful in rural Sicily. He hired out his rig to haul bamboo from the outlying villages back to the factory in town. Long ago he had been to Montelepre and had done some hauling of produce for Guiliano's father. Guiliano stepped into the middle of the road. The lupara dangled from his right hand. The driver recognized him though there was no expression on his face, just a momentary flicker of the eyes.</div>

<div class="line_en">Guiliano greeted him with the familiar style he had used as a child, calling him Uncle. "Zu Peppino," he said. "This is a lucky day for both of us. I am here to make your fortune and you are here to help me lighten the load of the poor." He was genuinely delighted to see the old man and burst into laughter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉里安诺用小时候的方式与他打招呼，喊了他一声“叔叔”。“祖·佩皮诺大叔，”他说道，“今天是我们两个人的幸运日，我能让你发财，你来这里帮我减轻点儿穷人的负担。”他看到这个老人的确特别高兴，不禁哈哈笑起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The old man didn't answer. He stared at Guiliano, his stony face waiting. Guiliano climbed up on the cart and sat beside him. He put the lupara out of sight in the wagon and then he laughed again with excitement. Because of Zu Peppino he was sure this would be a lucky day.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="老人没有答话，只是用眼睛盯着他，表情木然地等着。吉里安诺爬到车上，在他的身边坐下。他把短筒猎枪放进车里看不见的地方，接着又兴奋地笑起来。有了祖·佩皮诺，今天肯定是他的幸运日。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Guiliano relished the freshness of the late autumn, the beauty of the mountains on the horizon, the knowledge that his three men in the underbrush commanded the road with their guns. He explained his plan to Zu Peppino, who listened to him without a word or change of expression. That is, not until Guiliano told him what his reward would be: his cart full of food from the trucks. Then Zu Peppino grunted and said, "Turi Guiliano, you were always a fine, brave, young lad. Good-hearted, sensible, generous and sympathetic. You have not changed since you became a man." Guiliano remembered now that Zu Peppino was one of those old school Sicilians given to flowery speech. "Count on my help in this and all other things. Give my regards to your father who should be proud to have such a son."</div>

<div class="line_en">The lead truck driver blew his horn and inched his truck so that it nudged the nearest cart. The man on the cart turned and gave him such a look of malevolence that he immediately halted his truck and waited patiently. He knew that these carters, despite their humble profession, were proud fierce men who, in a matter of honor, their right to the road over motorized vehicles, would stab him to death and go on their way with a song on their lips.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最前面那辆卡车的司机按响喇叭，缓缓向前行驶，结果碰到离他最近的一辆大车。车上的人转过脸恶狠狠地瞪了他一眼，于是他立即把车停下，耐心地等待。他知道这些车夫虽然干着卑微的营生，但在面子问题上，在与机动车争抢道路使用权的问题上却态度强硬，弄不好会一刀把他捅死，然后嘴里哼着小曲扬长而去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The other two trucks ground to a halt. The drivers got out. One of them was from the eastern end of Sicily and one was a foreigner; that is, he came from Rome. The Roman driver approached the carters unzipping his jacket, shouting angrily for them to get their damn mules and shitboxes out of the way. And leaving one hand inside his jacket.</div>

Guiliano extended a hand and lifted him up. By that time, Pisciotta had herded the driver of the rear truck up to join the other two. The Roman had withdrawn his empty hand from his jacket and erased the anger from his face. Guiliano smiled with genuine good will and said, "This is a fortunate day for the three of you.

Pisciotta reported to the town square and let himself be recruited for work on the Duke of Alcamo's estate.

Books were everywhere -- on the sofa, the coffee tables and in special cases along the walls. Great massive paintings in rich oils hung on the walls and huge vases of flowers were everyplace. Silver and gold boxes were scattered on tables that kneeled before massive stuffed chairs and sofas. The room could hold a hundred people easily and the only person using it was this solitary woman dressed in white silk. Sunlight and air and the shouts of the children playing in the garden came through the open windows.

She saw he was impressed by the beauty of the room, and she was a little annoyed that he did not notice her own beauty. She thought it was too bad he was so obviously a peasant and did not move in her circles, where a little innocent flirtatiousness would not have been inappropriate.

<div class="line_en">Don Croce nodded. "I must admit you speak with reason. But think of Salvatore Guiliano as a force of nature, as a scourge of God. Surely you cannot expect the Friends of the Friends to guard you against earthquakes, volcanoes, floods? In time Guiliano will be controlled, I guarantee. But think: You pay the ransom I will arrange. You will have your protection without paying my usual rent for the next five years, and under the agreement Guiliano will not strike again. And why should he, since I and he presume you will have the good sense to keep these valuables in the bank vaults of Palermo? Women are too innocent -- they do not know the lust and greed with which men pursue the material goods of this world." He paused for a moment to allow the slight smile that had appeared on the Duke's face to disappear. Then he said, "If you calculate the rent to pay for the protection of your whole estate for five years in the troubled times ahead, you will see that you have lost very little by this misfortune."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="唐·克罗切点点头。“我必须承认你言之有理。可是萨尔瓦多·吉里安诺是一股自然的力量，是上帝降下的灾难。你肯定不能指望友中友保护你不受地震、火山爆发、水灾的伤害。我向你保证，到时候吉里安诺会被制服的。但是你想一想：你支付赎金，由我来安排。今后五年你将得到保护，而无需再向我支付一般的租金，我保证吉里安诺不再袭击你家。我和他都认为你会吃一堑长一智，把这些贵重的东西放在巴勒莫银行的金库里，他不会再去打扰你的。女人太幼稚了——她们不知道，世上的男人在追求物质财富时欲望有多强，胃口有多大。”他略作停顿，先让公爵脸上的微笑逐渐消失，然后才接着说，“如果你算一算，在今后五年的乱世中，你的整个庄园要交多少租金，你就会发现这次不幸事件并没有给你造成多大的损失嘛。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Duke did think it over. Don Croce was quite right about the hard times that lay ahead. He would lose more than a little by ransoming the jewels, despite the remission of five years' "rent"; who was to say that Don Croce would be alive for another five years or that he could contain Guiliano? But still it was the best bargain to be made. It would prevent the Duchess from wheedling more jewelry out of him in the years to come and that would be an enormous savings. He would have to sell another piece of land, but his ancestors had been doing that for generations to pay for their follies, and he still had thousands of acres left. The Duke agreed.</div>

<div class="line_en">Before Adonis left he abandoned finally his role as a teacher of romances to Guiliano. For the first time he spoke to him of the realities of Sicilian life. "My dear godson," he said, "no one admires your qualities more than I do. I love your high-mindedness, which I hope I helped instill in you. But now we must speak of survival. You can never hope to win against the Friends of the Friends. For the last thousand years, like a million spiders, they have spun a gigantic web over all of life in Sicily. Don Croce now stands in the center of that web. He admires you, he wants your friendship, he wants you to grow rich with him. But you must bend sometimes to his will.
