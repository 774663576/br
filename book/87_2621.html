<div class="line_en">The entire story would take hours for me to tell you, and time is short, so accept these things as fact: last month there was an accident in the lab and the virus we were studying escaped. All my colleagues who were infected are dead or dying, and the nature of the disease is such that those still living have lost their senses. This virus robs its victims of their humanity, forcing them in their sickness to seek out and destroy life. Even as I write these words, I can hear them, pressing against my locked door like mindless, hungry animals, crying out like lost souls.</div>

<div class="line_en">I sit here trying to think of where to begin, of how to explain in a few simple words all that's happened in my life since we last spoke, and already I fail. I hope this letter finds you well and whole, and that you will forgive the tangents of my pen; this isn't easy for me. Even as I write, I can feel the simplest of concepts slipping away, lost to feelings of despair and confusion, but I have to tell you what's in my heart before I can rest. Be patient, and accept that what I tell you is the truth.</div>

<div class="line_en">Jill sighed, laying the crumpled paper gently on the desk. The creatures were victims of their own research. It seemed she'd had the right idea about what had happened in the mansion, though reading the heartfelt letter put a serious damper on any pride she might have taken from her deduction skills. After placing the sun crest, she'd decided that the upstairs office merited a closer look and with a little digging, she'd found the final scrawled testament of Crackhorn, tucked in a drawer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔发出了长长的叹息，将那封被揉得乱七八糟的纸放回了桌子上。那些怪物是他们自己研究的牺牲品。关于这间别墅里所发生的事情，自己的想法基本上是正确的。而且在读过这封充满了爱的信之后，吉尔更是为自己的推理能感到自豪。将太阳徽章镶嵌到控制台上之后，她想要对二楼的办公室进行更加彻底的搜查。于是在抽屉中找到了这封克拉克朗的遗书。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In spite of the guilt that is burned into my very being, that will haunt my every breath, I might have tried to survive, if only to see you again.

<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔跑向阴暗的回廊，心中并没有抱有过多的期待，穿过门后朝右侧一转。她一下子就看到那扇钢铁大门，此时早已敞开。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jill broke into a run, feeling the clean warmth of summer air against her skin as she rounded the corner in the stone path and let out a short, triumphant laugh as she saw the four placed crests next to the open door. A warm breeze was flowing through the room that the puzzle had unlocked, a small storage shed for gardening tools. The metal door on the wall opposite was standing open, and Jill could see moonlight playing across a brick wall just past the rusted hinges.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔一边感受着夏季清爽而温暖的空气，一边奔跑过去。当看到被打开的铁门旁边镶嵌有四枚徽章的控制台时，她发出了胜利的笑声。温暖的夜风吹进那间小屋，里面放置着一些园艺工具。小屋的里面还有一扇敞开的金属门，月光洒落在生锈合页旁的砖墙上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Barry had been right, the door led outside. They'd be able to get help now, find a safe route through the woods or at least signal.</div>

<div class="line_en">Jill's grin faded as she stepped into the shed, absently taking in the dusty boxes and barrels that lined the gray stone walls. Barry had known where she was, had suggested himself that she take the second floor of the west wing…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔在走入小屋中的同时，微笑逐渐从她的脸上消失。小屋中只有落满灰尘的箱子与木桶排列在灰色的墙壁前。巴瑞知道我的位置，因为是他指示我前往西侧二楼进行调查的…">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a bit of a rationalization, but she had to admit to herself that the thought of returning to the mansion with a possible escape in front of her wasn't all that enticing. She unholstered her Beretta and walked toward the outer door, her decision made.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="嗯，这倒是个合理的判断。但是老实说，当逃离这里的可能性就摆在面前的时候，特意返回到那个可怕的别墅这种想法根本没有任何诱惑力。吉尔从枪套中抽出贝雷塔，朝着对面的那扇门走去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The first thing she noticed was the sound of rushing water over the soft forest noises that filled the cooling air, like a waterfall. The second and third were the bodies of the two dogs that lay across the irregular stone path, shot to death.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她首先听到了潺潺的流水声，飘散在夜风中的水声，就像是瀑布一样。接下来发现的是躺在凹凸不平的石子小路旁边的两只狗，它们都是被枪射杀的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jill edged out into a high-walled courtyard, low hedges set into brick planters on either side. Dark clouds hung oppressively low overhead. Across the open space was a barred iron gate just past an island of shrubs; to her left, a straight path overshadowed by the ten-foot-high brick walls that bordered it. The gentle waterfall sound seemed to come from that direction, though the path ended abruptly in a metal gate a few feet high.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔在被高墙包围的中庭里慢慢地前进。在道路两侧用土坯制成的花架上种植着一些观赏植物，在头顶如同乌云般低沉地垂着。在场地的另一侧低矮灌木丛的后面有一扇生锈的铁格栅门。左手边有一条笔直延伸的小路，在路边建有一面大概四英尺高的砖墙。瀑布的声音就是从那边传来的，而这条路却被一首金属门所隔断。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jill hesitated, looked back at the arched, rusty gate in front of her and then at the curled bodies of the mutant dogs. They were both closer to the gate than the walkway, and assuming they'd been killed while attacking, the shooter would have been headed in that direction.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔有些犹豫，可还是朝着正前方的那扇生锈的铁门走去，走了几步便再次发现了狗的尸体。那两具尸体就倒在左侧的小路靠近拱形铁格栅门的附近。大概是在发动攻击时被射杀的吧，而开枪的人一定就站在对面…">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was a sudden sound of water splashing wildly, making the decision for her. Jill turned and ran down the moonlit walk, hoping to catch a glimpse of whatever was making the noise.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是突然响起了流水飞溅的声音。吉尔在心里打定主意，朝着月光照耀下的小路走去，她想要看看到底是什么东西发出水声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She stared at the small waterfall, blinking, not sure if her eyes were playing tricks on her. The splashing had stopped as soon as the person disappeared, and she was fairly certain that she wasn't hearing things-which meant that the rushing water concealed a secret passage.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔紧紧盯着那个小瀑布，不停地眨着眼睛。自己眼花了？在人影消失的同时，流水声也中断了。吉尔十分确信这一点——也就是说，那条瀑布是秘密通道的伪装。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She reached the end of the stone path and leaned over the gate, then drew back a little, surprised by the sudden drop off. There were no stairs, the gate opened to a tiny platform elevator and a huge, open courtyard, twenty feet below.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她走到石子路的尽头，身体探出门外——接着突然一惊，又将身体缩回来。根本没有什么楼梯。那扇门与一个小型升降机平台连接在一起。下面是一个寛阔的中庭，离地面大概有二十英尺。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The splashing was off to the right, and Jill looked down and across the wide yard just in time to see a shadowy figure walk through the waterfall she'd heard, disappearing behind the curtain of water that cascaded down the west wall.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="在生锈的门旁边有一个单人用的升降机操纵焊。应该是按下开关，那个升降平台就会自动移动到下面的院子里。但是不管吉尔怎么按，机器没有任何反应。看来需要寻找其他的办法了。不好，刚才钻进瀑布后面的那个神秘人物此时已经渐渐走远了。">查看中文翻译</div>

Rebecca checked her Beretta for about the hundredth time since they'd left the main hall, chew-ing at her lower lip nervously. Chris could see how tightly wound she was and tried to think if there was anything she needed to know, anything that would help her if they were forced into a combat situation. S. T. A. R. S. training covered all the basics, but shooting at a video screen with a toy gun was a far cry from the real thing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克里斯与瑞贝卡走进小小的房间里，然后在另一侧的门前停下了脚步，两个人一起深呼吸。瑞贝卡自从离开正门大厅之后，对手中的贝雷塔进行了上百次的检查，而且好像十分不安地咬着嘴唇。克里斯知道她特别紧张。如果两人遭遇战斗的话，对瑞贝卡来说那应该只是经验的积累，并没有考虑过她会帮上忙。虽然S.T。A.R。S的成员全都接受过基本训练，但那只不过是拿着玩具枪在电子屏幕上和虚拟的敌人玩捉迷藏罢了，那和荷枪实弹的实戢相比完全是云泥之差。">查看中文翻译</div>

He'd been terrified, and trying desperately not to show it. The captain for the mission had been a tough-as-nails explosives expert, an extremely short woman named Kaylor. She'd pulled him aside just before they went in, looked him up and down, and given him the single best piece of advice he'd ever received.</div>

<div class="line_en">There were a couple of them sprawled out across the stones, soft moonlight glistening against their wet, sinewy bodies.

<div class="line_en">Chris pushed at the gate and it swung open on violently squealing hinges, revealing a huge, cut stone reservoir, easily the size of a couple of swimming pools put together. Deep shadows draped and hung at every side, caused by the seemingly solid walls of murky green trees and lush vegetation that threatened to break through the bordering rails.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克里斯推开拱形铁门，生锈的合页发出了刺耳的嘎吱声，两个人的眼前出现了一个巨大的蓄水池。大小差不多有两个普通游泳池加起来那么大，水池的周围种满了花草与低矮的灌木。由于常有水源，这些植物生长得支繁叶茂，甚至要冲出围在周围的篱笆。无形中，这些绿色的植物变成了一面坚固的围墙，将蓄水池围在当中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They moved forward, stopping at the edge of the massive pool. It was apparently in the slow process of being drained, the turbulent noise caused by the narrow flow of water through a raised gate on the east side. There wasn't a complete path around the reservoir, but Chris saw that there was a walkway bisecting the pool itself, about five feet below water level. There were bolted ladders at both sides, and the path had obviously been submerged until quite recently, the stones dark with dripping algae.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克里斯与瑞贝卡走到水池的近前才停下脚步。这个蓄水池很明显正在进行排水，东侧有一个排水门，从那里流出的细细的水流发出了嘈杂声。虽然蓄水池的周围并没有路。但是能够看到在水下大约5英尺有一条通道，好像将水池一分为二。而两边都有用螺栓固定的梯子，这条小路显然一直被淹没，直到不久前，石头上还沾满了滴水的藻类。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Chris frowned, an inner voice informing him coolly that he shouldn't be able to hear raindrops over the roar of the draining water.
