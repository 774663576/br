<div class="line_en">Mr. Morrison's song faded and I guessed he was on his way to the rear of the house. He would stay there for a while, walking on cat's feet through the quiet yard, then eventually return to the front porch again. Unable to sleep, I resigned myself to await his return by counting states. Miss Crocker had had a big thing about states, and I sometimes found that if I pretended that she was naming them off I could fall asleep. I decided to count the states geo- graphically rather than alphabetically; that was more of a challenge. I had gotten as far west as the Dakotas when my silent recitation was disturbed by a tapping on the porch. I lay very still. Mr. Morrison never made sounds like that.</div>

<div class="line_en">Twice I had awakened hoping that it was time to be up, but each time the night had been total blackness with no hint of a graying dawn. On the front porch Mr. Morrison sat singing soft and low into the long night, chanting to the approaching thunder, He had been there since the house had darkened after church, watching and waiting as he had done every night since Papa had been injured. No one had ever explained why he watched and waited, but I knew. It had to do with the Wallaces.</div>

<div class="line_en">After he and the Simmses left Great Faith, they went directly into Strawberry to get the pearl-handled pistol, but when they arrived the mercantile was already closed. The Simmses said that there was no sense in coming back for the pistol; they would simply go in and take it. T. J. was frightened at the thought, but the Simmses assured him that there was no danger.

<div class="line_en">In the storage room at the back of the store was a small open window through which a child or a person as thin as T. J. would wriggle. After waiting almost an hour after the lights had gone out in the Barnetts' living quarters on the second floor, T. J. slipped through the window and opened the door, and the Simmses entered, their faces masked with stockings and their hands gloved. T. J., now afraid that they had something else in mind, wanted to leave without the pistol, but R. W. had insisted that he have it. R. W. broke the lock of the gun case with an axe and gave T. J. the much- longed-for gun.</div>

<div class="line_en">For a long moment no one moved or said a word as Mr. Barnett shone the light directly on T. J., then on R. W. and Melvin, their faces darkened by the stockings. But when Mr. Barnett saw the cabinet lock busted, he flew into frenzied action, hopping madly down the stairs and trying to grab the metal box from Melvin. They struggled. with Mr. Barnett getting the better of Melvin, until R. W, whopped Mr. Barnett solidly on the head from behind with the flat of the axe, and Mr. Barnett slumped into a heap upon the floor as if dead.</div>

<div class="line_en">When Mrs. Barnett saw her husband fall, she dashed across the room and flailed into R. W., crying "You niggers done killed Jim Lee! You done killed him!" R.

<div class="line_cn" title="巴尼特太太看到丈夫倒了下去，立刻冲下楼，狠狠捶打着罗文，哭喊着：“你这个黑鬼！你把他打死了！打死了！”罗文为了摆脱她，打了她一巴掌，巴尼特太太的头撞向了炉子，也晕了过去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Once they were outside T. J. wanted to come straight home, but the Simmses said they had business to take care of and told him to wait in the back of the truck. When T. J. objected and said that he was going to tell everybody it was R. W. and Melvin who had hurt the Barnetts unless they took him home, the two of them lit into him, beating him with savage blows until he could not stand, then flung him into the back of the truck and went down the street to the pool hall. T. J. lay there for what he thought must have been an hour before crawling from the truck and starring home. About a mile outside of town, he got a ride with a farmer headed for Smellings Creek by way of Soldiers Road. Not wanting to walk past the Simmses' place for fear R. W. and Melvin had taken the Jackson Road home, he did not get out at the Jefferson Davis School Road intersection, but instead crossed Soldiers Bridge with the farmer and got out at the intersection beyond the bridge and walked around, coming from the west to our house.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们出来后，提杰想直接回家，但罗文和马文说还有事情要办，让提杰在卡车后面等着。提杰威胁他们，要是不先送他回家，他就说是他们俩伤了巴尼特夫妇。结果罗文他们狠狠地揍了他一顿，直到他站都站不起来。然后他们撇下他，去了撞球店。提杰在那里躺了约莫一个小时才起来，往家里走。出城一千米后，他遇到了一个要经过士兵桥岔路口到斯梅林河的农夫，就搭了一段便车。他担心马文他们走杰克逊路回家，所以过桥之后才敢下车，从西边绕到我们家。">查看中文翻译</div>

At the side of the house, several men were climbing through the same window T. J. had entered only a few minutes be- fore. Soon, the front door was flung open from the inside and Mr. and Mrs. Avery were dragged savagely by their feet from the house. The Avery girls were thrown through the open windows. The older girls, attempting to gather the younger children to them, were slapped back and spat upon. Then quiet, gentle Claude was hauled out, knocked to the ground and kicked.</div>
