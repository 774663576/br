<div class="line_en">Oliver, being left to himself in the undertaker's shop, set the lamp down on a workman's bench, and gazed timidly about him with a feeling of awe and dread, which many people a good deal older than he will be at no loss to understand. An unfinished coffin on black tressels, which stood in the middle of the shop, looked so gloomy and death-like that a cold tremble came over him, every time his eyes wandered in the direction of the dismal object: from which he almost expected to see some frightful form slowly rear its head, to drive him mad with terror. Against the wall were ranged, in regular array, a long row of elm boards cut in the same shape: looking in the dim light, like high-shouldered ghosts with their hands in their breeches pockets. Coffin-plates, elm-chips, bright-headed nails, and shreds of black cloth, lay scattered on the floor; and the wall behind the counter was ornamented with a lively representation of two mutes in very stiff neckcloths, on duty at a large private door, with a hearse drawn by four black steeds, approaching in the distance. The shop was close and hot. The atmosphere seemed tainted with the smell of coffins. The recess beneath the counter in which his flock mattress was thrust, looked like a grave.</div>

<div class="line_en">But his heart was heavy, notwithstanding; and he wished, as he crept into his narrow bed, that that were his coffin, and that he could be lain in a calm and lasting sleep in the churchyard ground, with the tall grass waving gently above his head, and the sound of the old deep bell to soothe him in his sleep.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尽管如此，他依然心情沉重，在缩进他那狭窄的铺位里去的时候，仍然甘愿那就是他的棺材，他从此可以安安稳稳地在教堂墓地里长眠了，高高的野草在头顶上轻盈地随风摇曳，深沉的古钟奏响，抚慰自己长眠不醒。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Oliver was awakened in the morning, by a loud kicking at the outside of the shop-door: which, before he could huddle on his clothes, was repeated, in an angry and impetuous Manner, about twenty-five times. When he began to undo the chain, the legs desisted, and a voice began.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="清晨，奥立弗被外边一阵喧闹的踢打铺门的声音惊醒了，他还没来得及胡乱穿上衣服，那声音又愤怒而鲁莽地响了大约二十次。当他开始拉开门闩的时候，外边不再踢了，有个声音说道：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Nor were these the only dismal feelings which depressed Oliver. He was alone in a strange place; and we all know how chilled and desolate the best of us will sometimes feel in such a situation. The boy had no friends to care for, or to care for him. The regret of no recent separation was fresh in his Mind; the absence of no loved and well-remembered face sank heavily into his heart.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="使奥立弗感到压抑的不仅仅是这些令人沮丧的感觉。他于然一身，呆在一个陌生的场所，众所周知，处于这么一种境地，就是我们当中的佼佼者有时也会感到凄凉与孤独。这孩子没有一个需要他去照看的朋友强调要在人的本能结构中进行革命，同单纯的物质需要决裂，或者反过来说，也没有朋友可以照看他。他并不是刚刚经历了别愁离恨，也不是因为看不到亲切熟悉的面容而觉得心里沉甸甸的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Oliver had been too often subjected to the process to which the very expressive monosyllable just recorded bears reference, to entertain the smallest doubt that the owner of the voice, whoever he might be, would redeem his pledge, most honourably. He drew back the bolts with a trembling hand, and opened the door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对于奥立弗来说，“揍”是一个极富表现力的字眼，这一过程他领教过无数次了，因而丝毫不存侥幸心理，管他是谁，反正那个声音的主人是要极其体面地履行诺言的。奥立弗的手颤抖着拍下门闩，打开铺门。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For a second or two, Oliver glanced up the street, and down the street, and over the way: impressed with the belief that the unknown, who had addressed him through the key-hole, had walked a few paces off, to warm himself; for nobody did he see but a big charity-boy, sitting on a post in front of the house, eating a slice of bread and butter: which he cut into wedges, the size of his Mouth, with a clasp-knife, and then consumed with great dexterity.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="奥立弗朝街的两头看了看，又看了一眼街对面，他以为刚才透过锁眼跟自己打过招呼的陌生人想暖暖身子，已经走开了，因为他没看见其他人，只看见一名大块头的慈善学校学生，坐在铺子前边的木桩上，正在吃一块奶油面包。大块头用一把折刀把面包切成同嘴巴差不多大小的楔形，又异常灵巧地全部投进嘴里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I'm Mister Noah Claypole," said the charity-boy, "and you're under me. Take down the shutters, yer idle young ruffian!" With this, Mr. Claypole administered a kick to Oliver, and entered the shop with a dignified air, which did him great credit. It is difficult for a large-headed, small-eyed youth, of lumbering make and heavy countenance, to look dignified under any circumstances; but it is More especially so, when superadded to these personal attractions are a red nose and yellow smalls.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我是诺亚克雷波尔先生，”他说，“你就属我管，把窗板放下来，你这个懒惰的小坏蛋。”说罢，克雷波尔先生赏了奥立弗一脚，神气活现地走进店铺去了，这副派头替他增光不少。要让一个身材粗笨，面容呆板，大头鼠眼的小伙子显得神气十足，在任何情况下都不是件容易的事，更何况在个人尊容方面替他增加魅力的又是一尊红鼻子和一条黄短裤。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Oliver, having taken down the shutters, and broken a pane of glass in his effort to stagger away beneath the weight of the first one to a small court at the side of the house in which they were kept during the day, was graciously assisted by Noah: who having consoled him with the assurance that "he'd catch it," condescended to help him. Mr. Sowerberry came down soon after. Shortly afterwards, Mrs. Sowerberry appeared. Oliver having "caught it," in fulfilment of Noah's prediction, followed that young gentleman down the stairs to breakfast.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Let him alone!" said Noah. "Why everybody lets him alone enough, for the matter of that. Neither his father nor his Mother will ever interfere with him. All his relations let him have his own way pretty well. Eh, Charlotte? He! he! he!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“干吗？”诺亚说道，“哼，因为一个个都由着他，这儿可不行。不管是他爹还是他妈，都不会来管他了。他所有的亲戚也由着他胡来。喔，夏洛蒂。嘻嘻嘻！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, you queer soul!" said Charlotte, bursting into a hearty laugh, in which she was joined by Noah; after which they both looked scornfully at poor Oliver Twist, as he sat shivering on the box in the coldest corner of the room, and ate the stale pieces which had been specially reserved for him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“喔，你这个怪人！”夏洛蒂不禁大笑起来，诺亚也跟着笑了，他俩笑够了之后，又傲慢地看了奥立弗一眼，这功夫他正呆在离火炉最远的角落里，哆哆嗦嗦地坐在一只箱子上，吃着特意给他留下的馊臭食物。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Noah was a charity-boy, but not a workhouse orphan. No chance-child was he, for he could trace his genealogy all the way back to his parents, who lived hard by; his Mother being a washerwoman, and his father a drunken soldier, discharged with a wooden leg, and a diurnal pension of twopence-halfpenny and an unstateable fraction. The shop-boys in the neighbourhood had long been in the habit of branding Noah in the public streets, with the ignominious epithets of "leathers," "charity," and the like; and Noah had bourne them without reply. But, now that fortune had cast in his way a nameless orphan, at whom even the meanest could point the finger of scorn, he retorted on him with interest. This affords charming food for contemplation. It shows us what a beautiful thing human nature may be made to be; and how impartially the same amiable qualities are developed in the finest lord and the dirtiest charity-boy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="诺亚是慈善学校的学生，不是济贫院的孤儿。他不是私生子，顺着家谱可以一直追溯到他的境遇不佳的双亲，母亲替人洗衣服，父亲当过兵，经常喝醉酒，退伍的时候带回来一条木头假腿和一份抚恤金，数额为每天两个半便士，外带一个很难说清的尾数。邻近各家店铺的学徒老是喜欢在大街上用一些不堪人耳的浑名来嘲笑诺亚，诸如“皮短裤”啦，“慈善学堂”啦什么的，他一一照单全收，概不还价。现在可好，命运把一个连名字都没有的孤儿赐给了他，对这个孤儿，连最卑贱的人都可以指着鼻子骂，诺亚饶有兴致地对奥立弗来了个如法炮制。这件事十分耐人寻味，它向我们表明，人的本性是多么的美妙，同样美好的品质从不厚此薄彼，既可以在最出色的君子身上发扬，又可以在最卑污的慈善学校学生的身上滋长。">查看中文翻译</div>

It at once reduced Mr. Sowerberry to begging, as a special favour, to be allowed to say what Mrs. Sowerberry was Most curious to hear. After a short duration, the permission was Most graciously conceded.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，不，你不用来问我的意见，”苏尔伯雷太太大动感情，“你问别人去。”又是一阵歇斯底里的大笑，苏尔伯雷光生吓了个半死。这是夫妇间的一种极为寻常而又受到普遍认可的程序，通常都很灵验。苏尔伯雷先生当即告饶，请求太太特别恩准，允许自己把话说出来，苏尔伯雷太太其实很想听听是什么事。经过短短三刻钟不到的拉锯战，太太总算大发慈悲，予以批准。">查看中文翻译</div>

The houses on either side were high and large, but very old, and tenanted by people of the poorest class: as their neglected appearance would have sufficiently denoted, without the concurrent testimony afforded by the squalid looks of the few men and women who, with folded arms and bodies half doubled, occasionally skulked along. A great many of the tenements had shop-fronts; but these were fast closed, and mouldering away; only the upper rooms being inhabited. Some houses which had become insecure from age and decay, were prevented from falling into the street, by huge beams of wood reared against the walls, and firmly planted in the road; but even these crazy dens seemed to have been selected as the nightly haunts of some houseless wretches, for many of the rough boards which supplied the place of door and window, were wrenched from their positions, to afford an aperture wide enough for the passage of a human body. The kennel was stagnant and filthy. The very rats, which here and there lay putrefying in its rottenness, were hideous with famine.</div>

So, they put the bier on the brink of the grave; and the two mourners waited patiently in the damp clay, with a cold rain drizzling down, while the ragged boys whom the spectacle had attracted into the churchyard played a noisy game at hide-and-seek among the tombstones, or varied their amusements by jumping backwards and forwards over the coffin.
