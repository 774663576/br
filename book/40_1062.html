<div class="line_en">They took turns striking the ground with a spade, then shoveling the loose dirt aside. They hadn't planned on a big hole, or a deep one, so the work of digging shouldn't have been as demanding as it turned out. It was the drought, started in 1998, in its second year now, that was wreaking havoc everywhere. It had hardly snowed that past winter and didn't rain at all that spring. All over the country, farmers were leaving behind their parched lands, selling off their goods, roaming from village to village looking for water. They moved to Pakistan or Iran. They settled in Kabul. But water tables were low in the city too, and the shallow wells had dried up. The lines at the deep wells were so long, Laila and Mariam would spend hours waiting their turn. The Kabul River, without its yearly spring floods, had turned bone-dry. It was a public toilet now, nothing in it but human waste and rubble.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mariam was forty now. Her hair, rolled up above her face, had a few stripes of gray in it. Pouches sagged beneath her eyes, brown and crescent-shaped. She'd lost two front teeth. One fell out, the other Rasheed knocked out when she'd accidentally dropped Zalmai. Her skin had coarsened, tanned from all the time they were spending in the yard sitting beneath the brazen sun. They would sit and watch Zalmai chase Aziza.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛丽雅姆已经四十岁了。她那一头盘起的头发已经出现几绺灰白。眼睛下面出现了两个半月形的、松垮的棕色眼袋。她的门牙有两颗不见了。一颗自行脱落，另外一颗是她失手把察尔迈伊摔在地上时被拉希德打掉的。她的皮肤变得很粗糙，而且由于她们经常冒着烈日坐在院子中而被晒得发黑。她们会坐在院子里，看着察尔迈伊追逐阿兹莎。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">ZALMAI WAS TWO now. He was a plump little boy with curly hair. He had small brownish eyes, and a rosy tint to his cheeks, like Rasheed, no matter the weather. He had his father's hairline too, thick and half-moon-shaped, set low on his brow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="察尔迈伊两岁了。他是一个鬈发的胖小子。他那双棕色的眼睛很小，不管天气如何，脸颊上总是有两抹红晕，跟拉希德一样。他头发茂密，发际线也像他父亲，半月形的，离眉毛很近。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When Laila was alone with him, Zalmai was sweet, good-humored, and playful. He liked to climb Laila's shoulders, play hide-and-seek in the yard with her and Aziza. Sometimes, in his calmer moments, he liked to sit on Laila's lap and have her sing to him. His favorite song was "Mullah Mohammad Jan." He swung his meaty little feet as she sang into his curly hair and joined in when she got to the chorus, singing what words he could make with his raspy voice:</div>

<div class="line_en">But Zalmai worshipped his father, and, because he did, he was transformed when his father was around to dote on him. Zalmai was quick then with a defiant cackle or an impudent grin. In his father's presence, he was easily offended. He held grudges. He persisted in mischief in spite of Laila's scolding, which he never did when Rasheed was away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但察尔迈伊崇拜他的父亲，因为这一点，当他父亲走过来逗他玩的时候，他就变了一个人。察尔迈伊会赶忙走过去，然后咯咯大笑或者露出放肆的笑容。他父亲在场的时候，他很容易发脾气。他故意捣乱。他不顾莱拉的责骂，不停地胡来；拉希德不在时他从来不会如此。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Laila loved the moist kisses Zalmai planted on her cheeks, loved his dimpled elbows and stout little toes. She loved tickling him, building tunnels with cushions and pillows for him to crawl through, watching him fall asleep in her arms with one of his hands always clutching her ear. Her stomach turned when she thought of that afternoon, lying on the floor with the spoke of a bicycle wheel between her legs. How close she'd come. It was unthinkable to her now that she could have even entertained the idea. Her son was a blessing, and Laila was relieved to discover that her fears had proved baseless, that she loved Zalmai with the marrow of her bones, just as she did Aziza.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莱拉喜欢察尔迈伊湿漉漉的嘴唇亲吻她的脸颊，喜欢他肉乎乎的手肘和结实的脚趾。她喜欢挠他痒痒，喜欢用坐垫和枕头搭一条隧道让他爬过去，喜欢看着他总是一只手抓着她的耳朵在她怀里呼呼入睡。每当想起那个下午，她躺在地板上，大腿之间摆着一条自行车车轮的辐条，她就会浑身难受。当时她差点就做了那件事。如今她为自己当初产生那样的念头而觉得不可思议。她的儿子是真主的恩赐，莱拉如释重负地发现她先前的担心完全是杞人忧天，她对察尔迈伊爱之入骨，就像她爱阿兹莎一样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Rasheed approved of all of it. "A sign of intelligence," he said. He said the same of Zalmai's recklessness -- when he swallowed, then pooped, marbles; when he lit matches; when he chewed on Rasheed's cigarettes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="拉希德对此赞赏有加。“这表明他很聪明。”他说。察尔迈伊莽撞的时候——当他把石块吞下去再吐出来的时候，当他点火柴的时候，当他咀嚼拉希德的烟草的时候——拉希德也都这么说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When Zalmai was born, Rasheed had moved him into the bed he shared with Laila. He had bought him a new crib and had lions and crouching leopards painted on the side panels. He'd paid for new clothes, new rattles, new bottles, new diapers, even though they could not afford them and Aziza's old ones were still serviceable. One day, he came home with a battery-run mobile, which he hung over Zalmai's crib. Little yellow-and-black bumblebees dangled from a sunflower, and they crinkled and squeaked when squeezed. A tune played when it was turned on.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="察尔迈伊出世之后，拉希德把他抱到他和莱拉同睡的床上。他给他买了一张新的婴儿床，四边的木板上画着狮子和潜伏的猎豹。他花钱买了新的衣服，新的拨浪鼓，新的奶瓶，新的尿片，尽管这些东西都很贵，而且阿兹莎原来的那些东西都还能用。有一天，他带了一个装电池的可移动玩具，他把它挂在察尔迈伊的婴儿床上。玩具是一朵向日葵，用绳子系着一些黄色和黑色的蜜蜂。那些蜜蜂一捏就会发出吱吱声和咯咯声。这个玩具打开之后，会有音乐响起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Most days, Laila was deprived of her son. Rasheed took him to the shop, let him crawl around under his crowded workbench, play with old rubber soles and spare scraps of leather. Rasheed drove in his iron nails and turned the sandpaper wheel, and kept a watchful eye on him. If Zalmai toppled a rack of shoes, Rasheed scolded him gently, in a calm, half-smiling way. If he did it again, Rasheed put down his hammer, sat him up on his desk, and talked to him softly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="多数日子里，莱拉被剥夺了和儿子相处的机会。拉希德带他到鞋店去，让他在那乱糟糟的工作台周围爬来爬去，玩着废旧的橡胶鞋跟和多余的皮革碎片。拉希德一边敲着铁钉和转动砂轮，一边关爱地看着他。如果察尔迈伊把一堆鞋子给弄倒了，拉希德就会温柔地责备他，心平气和，而且还带着微笑。如果他又推倒一堆鞋，拉希德会放下铁锤，把他抱起来，让他坐在桌子上，轻声细语地跟他说话。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They came home together in the evening, Zalmai's head bouncing on Rasheed's shoulder, both of them smelling of glue and leather. They grinned the way people who share a secret do, slyly, like they'd sat in that dim shoe shop all day not making shoes at all but devising secret plots. Zalmai liked to sit beside his father at dinner, where they played private games, as Mariam, Laila, and Aziza set plates on the sofrah. They took turns poking each other on the chest, giggling, pelting each other with bread crumbs, whispering things the others couldn't hear. If Laila spoke to them, Rasheed looked up with displeasure at the unwelcome intrusion. If she asked to hold Zalmai -- or, worse, if Zalmai reached for her -- Rasheed glowered at her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="晚上他们一起回家，察尔迈伊的脑袋趴在拉希德的肩膀上一跳一跳，他们两人身上都散发出胶水和皮革的味道。他们狡猾地笑着，好像两人之间有什么秘密，好像他们一整天坐在那个阴暗的鞋店，什么都没干，只顾着商谈什么阴谋似的。吃晚饭的时候，察尔迈伊喜欢坐在他父亲身边，当玛丽雅姆、莱拉和阿兹莎把饭菜摆到餐垫上时，他们就坐在那儿玩游戏。他们轮流伸手去捅彼此的胸膛，咯咯地笑着，不停地用面包屑投掷对方，低声说一些其他人听不见的话。如果莱拉不识相地和他们说话，拉希德会抬起头来，不高兴地瞪着她。如果她想抱察尔迈伊——或者更糟糕的是，察尔迈伊朝她伸出手——拉希德就会对她怒目而视。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Aziza's hair had become as light as Laila's. Laila could see her own dimples on her cheeks. Aziza had turned into a calm, pensive little girl, with a demeanor that to Laila seemed beyond her six years. Laila marveled at her daughter's manner of speech, her cadence and rhythm, her thoughtful pauses and intonations, so adult, so at odds with the immature body that housed the voice. It was Aziza who with lighthearted authority had taken it upon herself to wake Zalmai every day, to dress him, feed him his breakfast, comb his hair. She was the one who put him down to nap, who played even-tempered peacemaker to her volatile sibling. Around him, Aziza had taken to giving an exasperated, queerly adult headshake.</div>

As Rasheed watched with anticipation, the way people wait the simple tricks of street magicians, Zalmai pulled on the TV's wire, pushed the buttons, pressed his palms to the blank screen.

<div class="line_cn" title="这是她第一次打别人。以前她也曾跟塔里克开玩笑地打来打去。但当时他们并没有握紧拳头，与其说是捶打，不如说是轻拍，其中包含的是意犹未尽的爱怜。他们会瞄准一块肌肉，塔里克会用一种专业人员的口气，说那是三角肌。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">From the other side of the room, a gasp, a yelp, and a scream. Laila didn't know who had made which noise. At the moment, she was too astounded to notice or care, waiting for her mind to catch up with what her hand had done. When it did, she believed she might have smiled. She might have grinned when, to her astonishment, Rasheed calmly walked out of the room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="房间的另一边传来一声惊呼、一声大叫和一声哭喊。莱拉不知道哪个声音是谁发出来的。那一刻她自己吓呆了，顾不上去留意或者关心，脑子里还没弄清楚她的手刚刚做了什么动作。等到她回过神来，她觉得自己一定笑起来了。当她吃惊地发现拉希德一言不发走出房间时，她可能狰狞地笑了起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Suddenly, it seemed to Laila that the collective hardships of their lives -- hers, Aziza's, Mariam's -- simply dropped away, vaporized like Zalmai's palms from the TV screen. It seemed worthwhile, if absurdly so, to have endured all they'd endured for this one crowning moment, for this act of defiance that would end the suffering of all indignities.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然之间，在莱拉看来，她们——她，玛丽雅姆和阿兹莎——的生活中共同的困苦就这样退却了，像电视机屏幕上察尔迈伊的手印那样消失无踪。尽管这么想很荒唐，但因为这胜利的一刻，因为这奋起反抗将会终结所有的含羞忍辱，莱拉觉得她们所吃的那些苦头似乎都没有白吃。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Laila did not notice that Rasheed was back in the room. Until his hand was around her throat. Until she was lifted off her feet and slammed against the wall.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莱拉并没有注意到拉希德回到了客厅。直到他的手扼住她的喉咙。直到她被举得双脚离地，被摔在墙壁上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Laila watched the arch of her closed fist, slicing through the air, felt the crinkle of Rasheed's stubbly, coarse skin under her knuckles. It made a sound like dropping a rice bag to the floor. She hit him hard. The impact actually made him stagger two steps backward.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莱拉看见她的拳头从空中挥了出去，她的指节感受到拉希德毛茸茸的粗糙皮肤上的皱纹。这一拳击中拉希德的身体，发出的声音像是把一袋大米扔在地板上。她使的劲道很大，实际上冲击力让他跌跌撞撞地倒退了两步。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Up close, his sneering face seemed impossibly large. Laila noticed how much puffier it was getting with age, how many more broken vessels charted tiny paths on his nose. Rasheed didn't say anything. And, really, what could be said, what needed saying, when you'd shoved the barrel of your gun into your wife's mouth?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他那张狰狞的脸就在莱拉的脸上面，离得很近，看上去大得不可思议。莱拉发现岁月已经让他的脸皮变得松弛，在他的鼻子上留下一道道皱纹。拉希德什么也没说。实际上，当你把枪管塞进你妻子的嘴巴，还有什么话好说呢，还需要说什么呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">IT WAS THE RAIDS, the reason they were in the yard digging. Sometimes monthly raids, sometimes weekly. Of late, almost daily. Mostly, the Taliban confiscated stuff, gave a kick to someone's rear, whacked the back of a head or two. But sometimes there were public beatings, lashings of soles and palms.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="促使她们在院子里挖洞的原因是抢劫。有时候是每月一次，有时候是每周一次。最近几乎是每天一次了。多数时候，塔利班会在某人的屁股上踢一脚，或者在后脑勺上敲一两下，然后就把财物取走。但有时候也会当众毒打遭到劫掠的人们，拿鞭子抽他们的脚掌和手掌。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They patted the dirt when they were done, filling the hole up again. They tossed some of it around so it wouldn't look conspicuous.</div>

<div class="line_en">IN LAILA'S DREAM, she and Mariam are out behind the toolshed digging again. But, this time, it's Aziza they're lowering into the ground. Aziza's breath fogs the sheet of plastic in which they have wrapped her. Laila sees her panicked eyes, the whiteness of her palms as they slap and push against the sheet. Aziza pleads. Laila can't hear her screams. Only for a while, she calls down, it's only for a while. It's the raids, don't you know, my love? When the raids are over, Mammy and Khala Mariam will dig you out. I promise, my love. Then we can play. We can play all you want. She fills the shovel. Laila woke up, out of breath, with a taste of soil in her mouth, when the first granular lumps of dirt hit the plastic.</div>
