<div class="line_en">I turned toward the house, beckoning to Jacob as I ducked under the porch. I heard Charlie greeting them loudly behind me.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I'm going to pretend I didn't see you behind the wheel, Jake," he said disapprovingly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我会假装没有看到你坐在方向盘后的，杰克。”他不以为然地说道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Sure you do," Charlie laughed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你当然会。”查理大笑着说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I have to get around somehow." I recognized Billy's resonant voice easily, despite the years. The sound of it made me feel suddenly younger, a child.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“无论如何我都得到处转转。”不管过了多少年，我依然能轻而易举地认出比利洪亮的声音。这声音让我忽然觉得自己小了几岁，还是个孩子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I went inside, leaving the door open behind me and turning on lights before I hung up my jacket. Then I stood in the door, watching anxiously as Charlie and Jacob helped Billy out of the car and into his wheelchair.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“没。”他皱起眉。“我还需要一些零部件。这辆车是我们借来的。”他用拇指指着前院的方向。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“那么，最近过得怎么样？”雅克布问道。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“不，那好极了。我希望你能留下来看比赛。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Sure," he replied, his voice moving in the direction of the front room and the TV. I could hear Billy's chair follow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“当然。”他应声说道。他的声音向着前厅和电视机的方向移动着。我能听到比利的轮椅跟着过去了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Billy made a face at his son. "And, of course, Jacob was anxious to see Bella again," he added. Jacob scowled and ducked his head while I fought back a surge of remorse. Maybe I'd been too convincing on the beach.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="比利对自己的儿子作了个鬼脸。“还有，当然，雅克布也渴望着再次见到贝拉。”他补充道。雅克布皱起眉，迅速低下了头。我按捺住了一阵汹涌而至的自责。也许在沙滩上我表现得太令人信服了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Pretty good." I smiled. His enthusiasm was hard to resist. "How about you? Did you finish your car?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“相当不错。”我微笑着说。要抵抗住他的热情是件很难的事。“你呢？你的车弄好了吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Guess that explains it, then," he said. "I wondered why my dad was acting so strange."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那么，我猜这解释了一切。”他说道。“我还在奇怪为什么我爸表现得那么古怪呢。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I stared down at the pan, pulling up the edge of a sandwich to check the bottom side. "I got a ride with a friend."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="我挫败地叹了口气。“爱德华·卡伦。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"So who was it?" he asked, setting two plates on the counter next to me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那么，他是谁？”他问道，把两个盘子放到了我旁边的流理台上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">To my surprise, he laughed. I glanced up at him. He looked a little embarrassed.</div>

<div class="line_en">"My dad seemed to know him from somewhere."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我爸似乎在什么地方认识了他。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That's right." I faked an innocent expression. "He doesn't like the Cullens."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“非常正确。”我装出一副无辜的神情。“他不喜欢卡伦一家。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“哦。我只是有点怀疑，因为你不再开它。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Nice ride." Jacob's voice was admiring. "I didn't recognize the driver, though. I thought I knew most of the kids around here."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好车。”雅克布的声音里充满了赞叹。“但是我不认识开车的那个人。我想我认识这附近的大部分孩子。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“迷信的老男人。”雅克布用几不可闻的声音抱怨道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You don't think he'd say anything to Charlie?" I couldn't help asking, the words coming out in a low rush.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你不认为他会对查理说什么吗？”我情不自禁地问道，这些话低声地脱口而出。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh," I said, trying to sound indifferent.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦。”我说道，试图让自己听起来漠不关心一些。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I stayed in the front room after I carried the food out to Charlie, pretending to watch the game while Jacob chattered at me. I was really listening to the men's conversation, watching for any sign that Billy was about to rat me out, trying to think of ways to stop him if he began.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在我把食物拿给查理以后，我一直待在前厅里。当雅克布喋喋不休地和我说话时，我假装在看比赛。我是在认真听着大人的对话，寻找着任何比利打算密告我的迹象，试着想出他开口时打断他的方法。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jacob stared at me for a moment, and I couldn't read the expression in his dark eyes. "I doubt it," he finally answered. "I think Charlie chewed him out pretty good last time. They haven't spoken much since -- tonight is sort of a reunion, I think. I don't think he'd bring it up again."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="雅克布注视了我一会儿，我读不懂他黑眼睛里的神情。“我不能肯定。”他最终答道。“我想上次查理把他狠狠地训斥了一顿。从那以后他们就没怎么说过话——今晚有点重聚的意味，我想。我不认为他会再提起这件事。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh yeah -- you said you were friends with the Newton kid." He perked up. "Nice family." He mused for a minute. "Why didn't you ask him to the dance this weekend?"</div>

<div class="line_en">I cringed. Had Billy gotten something in before I'd joined them in the living room?</div>

<div class="line_en">"That was fun, Charlie," Billy said.</div>

<div class="line_en">I slept better that night, too tired to dream again. When I woke to the pearl gray morning, my mood was blissful. The tense evening with Billy and Jacob seemed harmless enough now; I decided to forget it completely. I caught myself whistling while I was pulling the front part of my hair back into a barrette, and later again as I skipped down the stairs. Charlie noticed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这天晚上我睡得更好些，因为太累了所以没有做梦。当我在这个珍珠灰色的早晨醒来时，我的心情简直乐翻了天。当我用一个夹子把刘海往后别起来的时候，我发现自己在吹口哨，而稍后我跳着下楼时又吹了一声。查理注意到了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh yeah," he muttered. Then he smiled at me apologetically. "So I guess it's good you'll be gone Saturday… I've made plans to go fishing with the guys from the station. The weather's supposed to be real warm. But if you wanted to put your trip off till someone could go with you, I'd stay home. I know I leave you here alone too much."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦是的。”他喃喃自语道。然后他认错地向我微笑着。“那么我猜，你这周六出去会相当不错…我计划和署里的家伙一起去钓鱼。那天的天气应该会相当暖和。但如果你想推迟你的旅程，直到有人能跟你一起去的话，我会待在家里。我知道我老是让你一个人待在这里。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Dad, you're doing a great job." I smiled, hoping my relief didn't show. "I've never minded being alone -- I'm too much like you." I winked at him, and he smiled his crinkly-eyed smile.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“爸爸，你做得相当不错。”我微笑着，希望我的宽慰没有表现出来。“我从不介意一个人待着——我和你太相似了。”我向他眨了眨眼，而他露出了那个眯着眼的笑容。">查看中文翻译</div>

He was waiting in his shiny car, windows down, engine off.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我相当匆忙，这样我就能在查理离开的那一秒准备好。我整理好书包，穿上鞋，刷完牙，甚至在一确定查理走出视线范围的时候我就冲出了门，但爱德华更快。他已经在他那辆银光闪闪的车旁等着了。车窗摇了下来，引擎已经关掉了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“很好。你昨晚过得怎样？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He wanted to know about people today: more about Renee, her hobbies, what we'd done in our free time together. And then the one grandmother I'd known, my few school friends -- embarrassing me when he asked about boys I'd dated. I was relieved that I'd never really dated anyone, so that particular conversation couldn't last long. He seemed as surprised as Jessica and Angela by my lack of romantic history.</div>

<div class="line_en">After dinner, I folded clothes and moved another load through the dryer. Unfortunately it was the kind of job that only keeps hands busy. My mind definitely had too much free time, and it was getting out of control. I fluctuated between anticipation so intense that it was very nearly pain, and an insidious fear that picked at my resolve. I had to keep reminding myself that I'd made my choice, and I wasn't going back on it. I pulled his note out of my pocket much more often than necessary to absorb the two small words he'd written. He wants me to be safe, I told myself again and again. I would just hold on to the faith that, in the end, that desire would win out over the others. And what was my other choice -- to cut him out of my life? Intolerable. Besides, since I'd come to Forks, it really seemed like my life was about him. But a tiny voice in the back of my mind worried, wondering if it would hurt very much… if it ended badly.</div>

<div class="line_en">With everything ready for the morning, I finally lay in my bed. I felt hyper; I couldn't stop twitching. I got up and rifled through my shoebox of CDs until I found a collection of Chopin's nocturnes. I put that on very quietly and then lay down again, concentrating on relaxing individual parts of my body. Somewhere in the middle of that exercise, the cold pills took effect, and I gladly sank into unconsciousness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="等到一切为明天做的准备都做完以后，我终于躺到了床上。我感到既兴奋又紧张。我没法停止翻来覆去。我起身在用力装CD的鞋盒里翻找着，直到我找到一张肖邦的小夜曲合辑。我让它安静地播放着，然后又躺下了，全神贯注地放松我身体的某些特定部分。在进行到这种练习的某个地方时，感冒药生效了，我愉快地陷入了昏睡之中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I woke early, having slept soundly and dreamlessly thanks to my gratuitous drug use. Though I was well rested, I slipped right back into the same hectic frenzy from the night before. I dressed in a rush, smoothing my collar against my neck, fidgeting with the tan sweater till it hung right over my jeans. I sneaked a swift look out the window to see that Charlie was already gone. A thin, cottony layer of clouds veiled the sky. They didn't look very lasting.</div>

<div class="line_en">I was relieved when it was late enough to be acceptable for bedtime. I knew I was far too stressed to sleep, so I did something I'd never done before. I deliberately took unnecessary cold medicine -- the kind that knocked me out for a good eight hours. I normally wouldn't condone that type of behavior in myself, but tomorrow would be complicated enough without me being loopy from sleep deprivation on top of everything else. While I waited for the drugs to kick in, I dried my clean hair till it was impeccably straight, and fussed over what I would wear tomorrow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当时间已经太晚，已经到了睡觉时间的时候，我很是宽慰。我知道自己太紧张，根本没法睡着，所以我做了一件我从没做过的事。我故意吃了点感冒药，尽管我并不需要——这种药片能让我昏睡过去，好好地睡上八个小时。正常情况下我不会宽恕自己的这种行为，但明天的情况已经够复杂的了，我没有必要在所有别的事情之外，再雪上加霜地让自己因为睡眠不足而昏昏沉沉。在我等着药物生效的时候，我擦着自己洗得干干净净的头发，直到它直得无懈可击为止，然后焦躁不安地准备好明天要穿的衣服。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I'll take you home," he promised. I couldn't tell if the promise was unconditional, or restricted to an immediate departure. I knew he thought it was fear that upset me, and I was grateful again that I was the one person whose mind he couldn't hear.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我会带你回家的。”他保证道。我说不清这个保证是没有限制的，还是指立刻离开。我知道他认为是害怕让我紧张不安。而我又一次对此感到高兴，我是唯一一个他无法读心的人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For the most part, we walked in silence. Occasionally he would ask a random question that he hadn't gotten to in the past two days of interrogation. He asked about my birthdays, my grade school teachers, my childhood pets -- and I had to admit that after killing three fish in a row, I'd given up on the whole institution. He laughed at that, louder than I was used to -- bell-like echoes bouncing back to us from the empty woods.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大多数时候，我们都沉默地走着。偶尔他会胡乱地提问，问一个在过去两天的审问里他没有问及的问题。他询问我的生日，我的小学老师，我童年时的宠物——而我不得不承认在一连养死了三条鱼以后，我放弃了整个计划。那时候他大笑起来，比我习惯的还有响亮——银铃般的回声在空荡荡的森林里回响着，回荡在我们身边。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It wasn't as hard as I had feared. The way was mostly flat, and he held the damp ferns and webs of moss aside for me. When his straight path took us over fallen trees or boulders, he would help me, lifting me by the elbow, and then releasing me instantly when I was clear. His cold touch on my skin never failed to make my heart thud erratically. Twice, when that happened, I caught a look on his face that made me sure he could somehow hear it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这趟旅程并没有我所畏惧的那样艰难。一路上几乎非常平坦，他为我把潮湿的蕨类植物和密布的苔藓拨到一边。当他笔直的路线穿过了倒下的树木或巨石时，他会帮助我，用手肘把我举起来，然后趁我还神志清醒的时候立刻放开我。他冰冷的触碰落在我的肌肤上，总能让我的心砰砰乱跳，无一落空。有两次，发生这样的状况时，我捕获到了他脸上的神情，我敢肯定他听见了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He gave up after a moment and led the way into the forest.</div>

<div class="line_en">The hike took me most of the morning, but he never showed any sign of impatience. The forest spread out around us in a boundless labyrinth of ancient trees, and I began to be nervous that we would never find our way out again. He was perfectly at ease, comfortable in the green maze, never seeming to feel any doubt about our direction.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这趟徒步旅行花掉了我几乎整个上午的时间，但他从未表现出半点不耐烦的迹象。这座森林在我们周围延伸成一座由古树构成的无尽的迷宫，我开始不安，生怕我们永远也无法再走出这座森林。他却悠然自得，轻松地走在这座绿色的迷宫里，丝毫不对我们的方向感到任何疑虑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Are we there yet?" I teased, pretending to scowl.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们到了吗？”我嘲弄道，假装沉下了脸。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Time to visit the optometrist," I muttered. His smirk grew more pronounced.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“该去检查视力了。”我喃喃低语道。他的坏笑更明显了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After several hours, the light that filtered through the canopy transformed, the murky olive tone shifting to a brighter jade. The day had turned sunny, just as he'd foretold. For the first time since we'd entered the woods, I felt a thrill of excitement -- which quickly turned to impatience.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="几个小时以后，渗入森林里的来自树庐穹顶的阳光开始发生了改变，由阴郁的黄绿色调变为一种更为明亮的翡翠色。天空一定转晴了，就像他之前说过的那样。在我们进入了森林以后，我头一次感到一阵兴奋的颤栗——但很快就变成了不耐烦。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I peered into the thick forest. "Um, should I?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我凝望着浓密的丛林。“呃，我应该看到了吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Nearly." He smiled at the change in my mood. "Do you see the brightness ahead?"</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他坏笑起来。“也许对你的眼睛来说早了点。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But then, after another hundred yards, I could definitely see a lightening in the trees ahead, a glow that was yellow instead of green. I picked up the pace, my eagerness growing with every step. He let me lead now, following noiselessly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但随后，在又走了一百码以后，我确实看见了树林前头的一片光亮，一片明黄的光辉而非绿色。我加快了脚步，每踏出一步，我的渴望就增长一分。现在他让我走在前面，无声地跟着我。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I reached the edge of the pool of light and stepped through the last fringe of ferns into the loveliest place I had ever seen. The meadow was small, perfectly round, and filled with wildflowers -- violet, yellow, and soft white. Somewhere nearby, I could hear the bubbling music of a stream. The sun was directly overhead, filling the circle with a haze of buttery sunshine. I walked slowly, awestruck, through the soft grass, swaying flowers, and warm, gilded air. I halfway turned, wanting to share this with him, but he wasn't behind me where I thought he'd be. I spun around, searching for him with sudden alarm. Finally I spotted him, still under the dense shade of the canopy at the edge of the hollow, watching me with cautious eyes. Only then did I remember what the beauty of the meadow had driven from my mind -- the enigma of Edward and the sun, which he'd promised to illustrate for me today.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我走到了那一片光亮的边缘，踏过最后一片蕨类植物，走进了我所见过的最可爱的地方。这片草地很小，几乎是圆形的，开满了野花——紫的，黄的，还有柔和的白色。我能听见不远处，一条奔流不息的溪水欢快的歌声。太阳正在头顶上直直地照射下来，用一种薄雾般的奶油色的阳光填满了这一圈空地。我慢慢地走着，惊奇不已，穿过柔软的芳草，摇曳的花朵，还有温暖的，染成了金色的空气。中途我转过身，想和他分享这一切，但他并没有在我身后，没有在我以为他在的地方。我原地旋转着，寻找着他的身影，一阵突然的恐惧袭击了我。最终我找到了他，他依然站在树庐浓重的阴影下，在这片洼处的边缘，用谨慎的目光看着我。这时我才想起来，这片草地的美丽完全被赶出了我的脑海——爱德华与阳光之谜，他曾经保证过，要在今天向我阐明的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I took a step back toward him, my eyes alight with curiosity. His eyes were wary, reluctant. I smiled encouragingly and beckoned to him with my hand, taking another step back to him. He held up a hand in warning, and I hesitated, rocking back onto my heels.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我向他走了一步，我的眼睛被好奇点亮了。他的眼神很谨慎，显得很不情愿。我鼓励地微笑着，向他招手示意，正要向他再走一步。他警告地举起了一只手，我犹豫了，退回了原处。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Edward seemed to take a deep breath, and then he stepped out into the bright glow of the midday sun.</div>
