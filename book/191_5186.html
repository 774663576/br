<div class="line_cn" title="他们离开茅舍，穿过树林，直走到他们寻到了一小股清清的泉水，多萝茜便在那里喝着，洗着，吃着她的面包。她看看放在篮子里的面包已经不多，剩下的，只够供给自己和托托一天吃的了。这小女孩子十分感谢稻草人，因为他什么东西都不吃。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Just then another groan reached their ears, and the sound seemed to come from behind them. They turned and walked through the forest a few steps, when Dorothy discovered something shining in a ray of sunshine that fell between the trees. She ran to the place and then stopped short, with a little cry of surprise.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="正当这时候，另外一声呻吟又送到他们的耳朵里，这声音似乎从他们的后面传来。他们转过身来，穿过树林没走几步，多萝茜发现有什么东西被太阳照出一道光来，照射在树林里。她跑到那地方去一看，突然停住了，吃惊地叫起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One of the big trees had been partly chopped through, and standing beside it, with an uplifted axe in his hands, was a man made entirely of tin. His head and arms and legs were jointed upon his body, but he stood perfectly motionless, as if he could not stir at all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="原来有一株大树，一部分被砍去了，在这株树旁边的，是一个完全用铁皮做的人。他的手里，高举着一把斧头。他的头、手臂、腿脚，都连接在他的身上，但是他一动不动地站着，好像不能够动弹。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes," answered the tin man, "I did. I've been groaning for more than a year, and no one has ever heard me before or come to help me."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Get an oil-can and oil my joints," he answered. "They are rusted so badly that I cannot move them at all; if I am well oiled I shall soon be all right again. You will find an oil-can on a shelf in my cottage."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“去拿一个油罐来，把油加在我的各个关节的地方。”他回答说，“这些地方锈得这么厉害，使得我完全不能动弹；如果给我加了油，立刻又能活动了。你可以在我茅舍里的一个架子上，找到一罐油。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Tin Woodman gave a sigh of satisfaction and lowered his axe, which he leaned against the tree.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那铁皮人发出一声满意的叹息，放下了他那靠在树上的斧头。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“第一，先把油加在我的头颈上。”铁皮人回答说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So she oiled it, and as it was quite badly rusted the Scarecrow took hold of the tin head and moved it gently from side to side until it worked freely, and then the man could turn it himself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她把油加了上去，因为那里锈得太厉害，稻草人捧着铁皮人的头，这边那边轻缓地摇动着，直到摇动了好多次以后，他才能够自己转动了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“这是极大的舒服呵，”他说道，“自从我锈了以来，一直把那斧头高举在空中。我很快活，最后到底能够把它放下来了。现在，如果你把油加在我腿上关节的地方，我将完全复原了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="稻草人问：“那是为什么呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I will tell you my story, and then you will know." So, while they were walking through the forest, the Tin Woodman told the following story: "I was born the son of a woodman who chopped down trees in the forest and sold the wood for a living. When I grew up, I too became a woodchopper, and after my father died I took care of my old mother as long as she lived. Then I made up my mind that instead of living alone I would marry, so that I might not become lonely.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我把我的故事告诉你，你就知道了。”当他们穿过这树林时，铁皮人就讲着这个故事：“我是生长在樵夫家的一个儿子。父亲在树林里砍伐树木，出卖柴爿来过活。当我长大了，也做了一个樵夫。在父亲死了以后，我一直侍养着我的老母亲，直到她也死去。后来我打定了注意，用结婚来结束我孤独的生活，这样可以使得我不寂寞。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"There was one of the Munchkin girls who was so beautiful that I soon grew to love her with all my heart. She, on her part, promised to marry me as soon as I could earn enough money to build a better house for her; so I set to work harder than ever.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“有一个芒奇金人的女子，她很美丽，不久就使我全心爱着她。她说，等到我赚的钱足够为她造一所好一些的屋子以后，就答应嫁给我。所以我比以前更加辛苦地工作了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But the girl lived with an old woman who did not want her to marry anyone, for she was so lazy she wished the girl to remain with her and do the cooking and the housework. So the old woman went to the Wicked Witch of the East, and promised her two sheep and a cow if she would prevent the marriage. Thereupon the Wicked Witch enchanted my axe, and when I was chopping away at my best one day, for I was anxious to get the new house and my wife as soon as possible, the axe slipped all at once and cut off my left leg.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是这个女子和一个老妇人一同住着，老妇人不愿意把女儿嫁给哪一个人，因为她很懒惰，愿意留下这个女儿和她住在一起，做那些烹饪和屋内的家务事。所以这个老妇人到东方的恶女巫那里，请她帮助，如果她能够阻止这个婚姻，答应酬谢她两只羊和一头牛。于是恶女巫在我的斧头上，施弄了妖术。因为我急于越快越好地得到新屋子和我的妻子，那斧头立刻滑出去，砍掉了我的左腿。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"This at first seemed a great misfortune, for I knew a one-legged man could not do very well as a wood-chopper. So I went to a tinsmith and had him make me a new leg out of tin. The leg worked very well, once I was used to it. But my action angered the Wicked Witch of the East, for she had promised the old woman I should not marry the pretty Munchkin girl. When I began chopping again, my axe slipped and cut off my right leg. Again I went to the tinsmith, and again he made me a leg out of tin.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“起初，这事似乎是一个很大的不幸，因为我知道，一条腿的人，是不能够做一个好樵夫的。所以我到一个铁皮匠那里去，请他装一条外面包着铁皮的新腿。那条腿我用惯了以后，也就工作得很好了。但是我的举动惹怒了东方的恶女巫，因为她答应过这个老妇人，要使我不能够娶这个美丽的芒奇金女子。当我开始再砍树时，斧头又滑过去，砍掉了我的右腿。我再到那个铁皮匠那里去，他再替我装一条外面包着铁皮的腿。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I thought I had beaten the Wicked Witch then, and I worked harder than ever; but I little knew how cruel my enemy could be. She thought of a new way to kill my love for the beautiful Munchkin maiden, and made my axe slip again, so that it cut right through my body, splitting me into two halves. Once more the tinsmith came to my help and made me a body of tin, fastening my tin arms and legs and head to it, by means of joints, so that I could move around as well as ever. But, alas! I had now no heart, so that I lost all my love for the Munchkin girl, and did not care whether I married her or not. I suppose she is still living with the old woman, waiting for me to come after her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我比以前更加辛苦地工作，就想这样地打败那个恶女巫。但是我哪里知道我的仇敌竟会这样残酷地来伤害我。她想出了一个新方法，来割断我和美丽的芒奇金女子的爱情，使得我的斧头再滑出去，恰好划过我的身体，把我劈成两半。这个铁皮匠再来帮助我，替我装了一个铁皮的身体，靠着这些关节，紧紧地连接着我那铁皮的手臂和腿脚，还有头，使得我像以前一样地能够自由移动。但是，唉！我现在没有心了。所以我失去了对于芒奇金女子的爱情，不在乎娶到她，或者娶不到她，我猜想她仍旧和老妇人住在一起，等着我去找寻她。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"My body shone so brightly in the sun that I felt very proud of it and it did not matter now if my axe slipped, for it could not cut me. There was only one danger -- that my joints would rust; but I kept an oil-can in my cottage and took care to oil myself whenever I needed it. However, there came a day when I forgot to do this, and, being caught in a rainstorm, before I thought of the danger my joints had rusted, and I was left to stand in the woods until you came to help me. It was a terrible thing to undergo, but during the year I stood there I had time to think that the greatest loss I had known was the loss of my heart. While I was in love I was the happiest man on earth; but no one can love who has not a heart, and so I am resolved to ask Oz to give me one.

<div class="line_cn" title="多萝茜不能够说些什么，因为她不知道她的两个朋友中谁说得对。她决定如果能够回到堪萨斯州和爱姆婶婶那里去，她不关心这个稻草人有没有脑子，铁皮人有没有心，或者每一个都得到了他们所要的东西。">查看中文翻译</div>
