<div class="line_en">One of the strange things about living in the world is that it is only now and then one is quite sure one is going to live forever and ever and ever. One knows it sometimes when one gets up at the tender solemn dawn-time and goes out and stands alone and throws one's head far back and looks up and up and watches the pale sky slowly changing and flushing and marvelous unknown things happening until the East almost makes one cry out and one's heart stands still at the strange unchanging majesty of the rising of the sun -- which has been happening every morning for thousands and thousands and thousands of years. One knows it then for a moment or so. And one knows it sometimes when one stands by oneself in a wood at sunset and the mysterious deep gold stillness slanting through and under the branches seems to be saying slowly again and again something one cannot quite hear, however much one tries. Then sometimes the immense quiet of the dark blue at night with millions of stars waiting and watching makes one sure; and sometimes a sound of far-off music makes it true; and sometimes a look in some one's eyes.</div>

<div class="line_en">And it was like that with Colin when he first saw and heard and felt the Springtime inside the four high walls of a hidden garden. That afternoon the whole world seemed to devote itself to being perfect and radiantly beautiful and kind to one boy. Perhaps out of pure heavenly goodness the spring came and crowned everything it possibly could into that one place. More than once Dickon paused in what he was doing and stood still with a sort of growing wonder in his eyes, shaking his head softly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="柯林第一次见到、听到四堵高墙里掩藏的花园时，就是这样。那天下午，仿佛整个世界都全心全意地要完美无缺、光彩照人，要对一个小男孩好。也许纯粹出于天坛般的好意，春天来把它所能有的每样东西都倾注到一个地方，满出来如皇冠。不止一次，迪肯打断正在做的事，静静地站着，眼里的不可思议越来越浓，轻轻摇头。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They drew the chair under the plum-tree, which was snow-white with blossoms and musical with bees. It was like a king's canopy, a fairy king's. There were flowering cherry-trees near and apple-trees whose buds were pink and white, and here and there one had burst open wide. Between the blossoming branches of the canopy bits of blue sky looked down like wonderful eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们把轮椅拖到李树下，李树因繁花而一片雪白，因蜜蜂而悦耳。像国王的华盖，童话里的国王的。附近有樱桃树开着花，苹果树的花苞粉红雪白，这儿、那儿一朵已经绽裂开。在华盖的枝枝繁花之间，是一点点蓝天，像奇妙的眼睛往下看着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mary and Dickon worked a little here and there and Colin watched them. They brought him things to look at -- buds which were opening, buds which were tight closed, bits of twig whose leaves were just showing green, the feather of a woodpecker which had dropped on the grass, the empty shell of some bird early hatched. Dickon pushed the chair slowly round and round the garden, stopping every other moment to let him look at wonders springing out of the earth or trailing down from trees. It was like being taken in state round the country of a magic king and queen and shown all the mysterious riches it contained.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛丽和迪肯这儿、那儿干一点活儿，柯林看着他们。他们拿东西给他看——正在展开的花苞，紧闭的花苞，一小截叶子刚刚吐绿的细枝，啄木鸟掉在草地上的一片羽毛，早孵的鸟蛋空壳。迪肯慢慢地推着轮椅绕了花园一圈又一圈，不时停下来让他看奇迹从土里冒出、从树上垂下。这就像被带进一个魔法国度，国王和王后展示给你国度里包含的一切神奇富丽。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This made them giggle so delightedly that they were obliged to cover their mouths with their hands, remembering that they must not be heard. Colin had been instructed as to the law of whispers and low voices several days before. He liked the mysteriousness of it and did his best, but in the midst of excited enjoyment it is rather difficult never to laugh above a whisper.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们被逗得快乐地咯咯笑，记起来不能弄出声，就之后用手捂着嘴。几天前，柯林被告知低声私语的规定。他喜欢其中的神秘感，尽了最大努力，但是在兴奋快乐之中，很难从不让笑声高于低语。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Tha'll see him often enow after a bit," answered Dickon. "When th' eggs hatches out th' little chap he'll be kep' so busy it'll make his head swim. Tha'll see him flyin' backward an' for'ard carryin' worms nigh as big as himsel' an' that much noise goin' on in th' nest when he gets there as fair flusters him so as he scarce knows which big mouth to drop th' first piece in. An' gapin' beaks an' squawks on every side. Mother says as when she sees th' work a robin has to keep them gapin' beaks filled, she feels like she was a lady with nothin' to do. She says she's seen th' little chaps when it seemed like th' sweat must be droppin' off 'em, though folk can't see it."</div>

<div class="line_en">Colin was almost too late but he just caught sight of him, the flash of red-breasted bird with something in his beak. He darted through the greenness and into the close-grown corner and was out of sight. Colin leaned back on his cushion again, laughing a little.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“是魔法把知更鸟送来的。”后来玛丽悄悄对迪肯说，“我知道是魔法。”因为她和迪肯都恐怕柯林可能会问起那棵树，十年前树枝折断，他们曾经一起细谈过，迪肯站在那里，烦恼地揉着头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But she had not felt as if she looked cheerful when she gazed at the tree.

<div class="line_en">"Mrs. Craven was a very lovely young lady," he had gone on rather hesitatingly. "An' mother she thinks maybe she's about Misselthwaite many a time lookin' after Mester Colin, same as all mothers do when they're took out o' th' world. They have to come back, tha' sees. Happen she's been in the garden an' happen it was her set us to work, an' told us to bring him here."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“克兰文太太是个非常可爱的年轻女士，”他相当犹豫地往下说，“妈妈说她想她经常在米瑟韦斯特庄园一带照看着柯林少爷，和所有的妈妈从这个世界被带走以后做的一样。她们必须得回来，你瞧。她在花园里，是她让我们来干活，告诉我把他带到这儿来。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mary had thought he meant something about Magic. She was a great believer in Magic. Secretly she quite believed that Dickon worked Magic, of course good Magic, on everything near him and that was why people liked him so much and wild creatures knew he was their friend. She wondered, indeed, if it were not possible that his gift had brought the robin just at the right moment when Colin asked that dangerous question. She felt that his Magic was working all the afternoon and making Colin look like an entirely different boy. It did not seem possible that he could be the crazy creature who had screamed and beaten and bitten his pillow. Even his ivory whiteness seemed to change. The faint glow of color which had shown on his face and neck and hands when he first got inside the garden really never quite died away. He looked as if he were made of flesh instead of ivory or wax.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛丽原来以为他说的是魔法。她是魔法的坚决信徒。她悄悄地深信迪肯施了魔法，当然是好魔法，对身边的一切，这就是为什么人们喜欢那么他，野生动物知道他是朋友。她在想，真的，在柯林问出危险问题的关头，有没有可能是他的才能招来的知更鸟。她觉得他的魔法整个下午都在作用，让柯林显得完全像另一人。他看着不可能像是一头尖叫着撕咬枕头的疯狂动物。甚至他的象牙白似乎都在变。初进花园是，他的手脸脖颈上隐隐露出的红光从没真正消亡。他显得是血肉做的了，而非象牙或者蜡。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was an agreeable idea, easily carried out, and when the white cloth was spread upon the grass, with hot tea and buttered toast and crumpets, a delightfully hungry meal was eaten, and several birds on domestic errands paused to inquire what was going on and were led into investigating crumbs with great activity. Nut and Shell whisked up trees with pieces of cake and Soot took the entire half of a buttered crumpet into a corner and pecked at and examined and turned it over and made hoarse remarks about it until he decided to swallow it all joyfully in one gulp.</div>
