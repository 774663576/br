<div class="line_en">One morning, Ella read aloud from a book in the drawing room. Her father sat in a chair opposite her, nibbling on a piece of toast slathered in honey.</div>

<div class="line_en">Now, now, Ella thought. Times are not so bad. Father is here and we have a roof above our heads. And we have each other.</div>

<div class="line_en">Six years passed, and true to her word, Ella stayed kind and courageous. She continued to make sure the littlest birds got just as much food as the big birds at the fountain. She made sure to say good morning and good evening to the cooks and maids of the house. When she had to make trips to the market, she smiled at everyone she passed. Always she felt her mother's presence, reminding her of the promise she had made all those years earlier.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="六年过去了，瑞拉一直遵守着自己的诺言：善良而勇敢。她还是会在喷泉旁边确保小鸟和大鸟都能吃到一样多的食物。她会每天问候家里的厨师和女佣们。去市场买东西时，她会向遇到的每一个人微笑。她一直觉得母亲就在身边，提醒着她不要忘记六年前做出的承诺。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Looking up, Ella smiled. She had harvested that honey especially for her father. It was his favorite treat, and the little things meant so much these days. The smile faltered a bit as she noticed the dust that had accumulated on the mantel and the curtains. Since her mother's death, the house had lost some of its sparkle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="瑞拉抬起头笑了。那是她特意为父亲收获的蜂蜜。父亲非常喜欢吃这些蜂蜜，虽然是不起眼的东西，却饱含着深情厚谊。但当瑞拉看到积满灰尘的壁炉架和窗帘时，她的笑容僵住了。母亲去世后，家里失去了一些生气。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">With a resolved nod, she returned her attention to the book and read the final paragraph aloud: "'And thence home, and my wife and I singing, to our great content, and if ever there were a man happier in his fortunes, I know him not.' " Closing the book gently, she looked at her father. "Thus ends Mr. Pepys. I do love a happy ending, don't you?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="瑞拉肯定地点点头，回过神来，开始读最后一段：“‘回到家以后，我和妻子尽情地歌唱，这个世界上还有谁比我更快乐呢？估计没有。’”瑞拉轻轻地合上书，看着父亲。“佩皮斯日记今天就念到这儿。我喜欢皆大欢喜的结局，你呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ella had been waiting for this day and knew immediately what he meant. Her father was a handsome and still rather young man. It did not make sense for him to spend the rest of his years alone. Still, her stomach fluttered uncomfortably at the thought of someone new in her life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="瑞拉早就等着这一天了，她立刻明白了父亲的意思。她的父亲仍然是个英俊而又年轻的男人，没道理让他就一个人度过余生。但是，想到自己的生活中要出现一个陌生人，瑞拉还是感到非常不安。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"As well they should be," Ella said. She paused before adding, "I suppose it would be selfish to ask for happy beginnings and middles as well."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“就像事情本该这样子，”瑞拉说。过了一会儿，她又说道：“我觉得想要故事的开头和中间也欢欢喜喜的有点太自私了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="父亲的脸上露出一丝宽慰的微笑。“她只是你的继母，”父亲说，“你还会有两个可爱的姐姐和你做伴。这样，不管我走多远，我都知道你平平安安待在家里，有人疼爱，有人保护。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Within a fortnight the plans of marriage had been made and the ceremony performed. Soon after, Ella found herself standing in front of her house waiting for the arrival of her new stepmother and stepsisters. Her father stood beside her, with a cautiously hopeful look on his face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不到两星期的时间里，婚礼筹划妥当，也举行了仪式。没多久，瑞拉就站在房前等候继母和姐姐们的到来。父亲站在她身旁，脸上的表情小心翼翼，而又满怀希望。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ella stood up and hugged her father tightly. This was bound to be a big change. But perhaps there was a silver lining. She would have sisters -- real sisters who could become real friends -- and a stepmother, who might, in time, become like a real mother…</div>

<div class="line_en">Ella wrung her hands. She had spent the past few days helping the staff clean the house. As Ella had looked around the home earlier that morning, she couldn't help missing her mother. Mother had loved seeing the home gleam after a fresh tidying.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="瑞拉搓着双手。最近几天她一直在帮忙打扫房屋。那天上午的早些时候她环顾家里时，忍不住想起了母亲。母亲以前最喜欢看到打扫一新的房屋。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The house was not the only thing to receive special attention. Ella wore her best dress, its blue complementing her eyes. Her blond hair had been brushed until it shined and then pulled back gently. Now, standing in front of the house, she hoped that she, too, would look fine through fresh eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="引人注目的不光是房子，瑞拉也穿上了最漂亮的礼服。蓝色的礼服很好地衬托了她的眼睛。她金黄色的头发梳得闪闪发亮，轻轻地拢到脑后。此刻，瑞拉站在房子前面，希望自己也能让新来的人眼前一亮。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Lady Tremaine's foot appeared in the door, beautiful in an ornate shoe. A moment later, Lady Tremaine's hand appeared and took one of the coachmen's hands. Then, with practiced grace, she stepped out of the carriage and onto the drive.</div>

<div class="line_en">She was one of the most beautiful women Ella had ever seen. Her skin was radiant and soft, her strawberry-blond hair piled atop her head in a fashionable coif. Her dress, clearly the latest fashion, was cinched tight at her tiny waist, and the jewels at her throat made her eyes sparkle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她是瑞拉见到过的最美丽的女人之一。皮肤柔嫩发亮，微红的金黄色头发挽在头顶，戴着时尚的贴头帽。她的礼服俨然也是最时新的款式，紧紧裹着她纤细的腰肢，项上的珠宝让她的眼睛熠熠生辉。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was a small commotion and the carriage rocked gently on its wheels. Then out stepped two young ladies. The eldest, Anastasia, was pretty, with dark hair and porcelain skin. Her sister, Drisella, had red hair and was slightly smaller in stature. Catching sight of Ella, Drisella looked her up and down, apparently not impressed. She whispered something into Anastasia's ear.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="车厢里一阵小小的骚乱，马车轻轻地晃动了一下。接着走出两位姑娘。年长的叫安泰西亚，她长得很漂亮，有一头乌黑的头发和像瓷器一样光滑的皮肤。她的妹妹崔西里亚，长着红头发，身材稍微小巧一点。崔西里亚看到瑞拉，就上下打量，显然觉得瑞拉不怎么起眼。她悄悄在安泰西亚耳边嘀咕着什么。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Have courage, be kind," Ella muttered to herself. It would do no good to start off on the wrong foot. Smiling, Ella said, "How do you do? I hope you will all be happy here."</div>

<div class="line_en">The insult was not lost on Ella. Still, she refused to react. Perhaps the girls were just cranky from their journey. She continued her welcome. "Would you like a tour of the house?" Ella asked.</div>

<div class="line_en">Her daughters snapped to attention. They were not used to being chastised by their mother. She usually let them get their way. But now she was telling them to be nice to their new country bumpkin of a sister. With a sigh, they followed Ella toward the farmhouse.</div>

<div class="line_en">As they entered, Lady Tremaine turned to Ella's father. "You did not say that your daughter was so beautiful," she said. It had been impossible to ignore. Compared to her own daughters, Ella had a grace and beauty that made them seem dull and mindless.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="进门时，特曼妮夫人对瑞拉的父亲说道：“你可没说你的女儿如此美貌。”对于这一点她无法视而不见，和自己的女儿相比，瑞拉既美丽又端庄，而自己的女儿则显得笨头笨脑，傻里傻气。">查看中文翻译</div>
