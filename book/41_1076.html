<div class="line_en">Once upon a time, in the days when divs and jinns and giants roamed the land, there lived a farmer named Baba Ayub. He lived with his family in a little village by the name of Maidan Sabz. Because he had a large family to feed, Baba Ayub saw his days consumed by hard work. Every day, he labored from dawn to sundown, plowing his field and turning the soil and tending to his meager pistachio trees. At any given moment you could spot him in his field, bent at the waist, back as curved as the scythe he swung all day. His hands were always callused, and they often bled, and every night sleep stole him away no sooner than his cheek met the pillow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从前那个时候，魔王、精灵和巨人还在大地上来来往往，有个名叫巴巴·阿尤布的农夫，和家人一起，住在一个小村子里，那村子叫马伊丹·萨卜兹。巴巴·阿尤布要养活一大家子，所以没日没夜地辛勤劳作，每天从日出开始，一直忙活到日落，犁田，翻土，照料他那几棵瘦弱的开心果树，弓着腰，屈着背，样子就像他整天挥动的那把大镰刀。他两手长满了老茧，还常常流血，每天晚上，头一挨上枕头，他就昏昏睡去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I will say that, in this regard, he was hardly alone. Life in Maidan Sabz was hard for all its inhabitants. There were other, more fortunate villages to the north, in the valleys, with fruit trees and flowers and pleasant air, and streams that ran with cold, clear water. But Maidan Sabz was a desolate place, and it didn't resemble in the slightest the image that its name, Field of Green, would have you picture. It sat in a flat, dusty plain ringed by a chain of craggy mountains. The wind was hot, and blew dust in the eyes. Finding water was a daily struggle because the village wells, even the deep ones, often ran low. Yes, there was a river, but the villagers had to endure a half-day walk to reach it, and even then its waters flowed muddy all year round. Now, after ten years of drought, the river too ran shallow. Let's just say that people in Maidan Sabz worked twice as hard to eke out half the living.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我得说，可不是只有他一个人这样。马伊丹·萨卜兹的所有村民都过着苦日子。往北走，在山谷里，有些村庄要幸运一些，它们有果树，有鲜花，有清爽的空气，还有小溪，流着凉凉的、干干净净的水。马伊丹·萨卜兹的意思是碧野绿田，却是个荒凉的地方，一点也没有它的名字带给人的那种诗情画意。它位于一块地势浅平、浮土覆盖的旷野上，紧邻着连绵的山脉。风是热的，吹起尘土，直入人眼。找水是每天例行的战斗，因为村里的井水总是见底，就连那些深井也不例外。是的，是有条河，可村民们得长途跋涉，走上半天，才能走到河边，即使这样，河水也是一年到头，浑浊不堪。现在，经过了十年的大旱，河水也变浅了。咱们这么说吧，马伊丹·萨卜兹的人们要付出双份的辛苦，才能讨得半份的生活。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Still, Baba Ayub counted himself among the fortunate because he had a family that he cherished above all things. He loved his wife and never raised his voice to her, much less his hand. He valued her counsel and found genuine pleasure in her companionship. As for children, he was blessed with as many as a hand has fingers, three sons and two daughters, each of whom he loved dearly. His daughters were dutiful and kind and of good character and repute. To his sons he had taught already the value of honesty, courage, friendship, and hard work without complaint. They obeyed him, as good sons must, and helped their father with his crops.</div>

<div class="line_en">Though he loved all of his children, Baba Ayub privately had a unique fondness for one among them, his youngest, Qais, who was three years old. Qais was a little boy with dark blue eyes. He charmed anyone who met him with his devilish laughter. He was also one of those boys so bursting with energy that he drained others of theirs. When he learned to walk, he took such delight in it that he did it all day while he was awake, and then, troublingly, even at night in his sleep. He would sleepwalk out of the family's mud house and wander off into the moonlit darkness. Naturally, his parents worried. What if he fell into a well, or got lost, or, worst of all, was attacked by one of the creatures lurking the plains at night? They took stabs at many remedies, none of which worked. In the end, the solution Baba Ayub found was a simple one, as the best solutions often are: He removed a tiny bell from around the neck of one of his goats and hung it instead around Qais's neck. This way, the bell would wake someone if Qais were to rise in the middle of the night. The sleepwalking stopped after a time, but Qais grew attached to the bell and refused to part with it. And so, even though it didn't serve its original use, the bell remained fastened to the string around the boy's neck. When Baba Ayub came home after a long day's work, Qais would run from the house face-first into his father's belly, the bell jingling with each of his tiny steps. Baba Ayub would lift him up and take him into the house, and Qais would watch with great attention as his father washed up, and then he would sit beside Baba Ayub at suppertime. After they had eaten, Baba Ayub would sip his tea, watching his family, picturing a day when all of his children married and gave him children of their own, when he would be proud patriarch to an even greater brood.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽说这五个孩子巴巴·阿尤布都爱，可到底有一个是他心里最喜欢的，那就是三岁的老幺卡伊斯。这小男孩有一双深蓝色的眼睛，不管见到谁，都会用响亮的笑声把人家迷住。他也是那种生龙活虎的娃子，总是弄得别人筋疲力尽。他一学会走路，就高高兴兴地走个没完，只要醒着，就整天不停，可让人着急的是，后来他夜里睡着觉也走。梦游的时候，他会走出家里的土坯屋，远远地走进月夜里去。父母自然觉得担心。万一他掉到井里怎么办？走丢了怎么办？最糟的是被夜里潜伏在旷野上的野兽叼走。他们用了许多方子，可没一个管用。最后，巴巴·阿尤布发现，最好的办法往往也是最简单的：他从家里一只山羊的脖子上，解下一个小铃铛，把它系到卡伊斯的脖子上。这样一来，要是卡伊斯半夜起来，铃铛一响，就会把别人弄醒。过了一段时间，梦游停止了，可是卡伊斯喜欢上了铃铛，再也不肯和它分开。于是，尽管铃铛已经没有了原先的用处，却还是系在这娃娃的脖子上。当巴巴·阿尤布干完一天漫长的农活，回到家中，卡伊斯便从屋里跑出来，一头撞进他父亲怀里，那铃铛也随着他的小步子，叮叮当当响个不停。巴巴·阿尤布把他举起来，抱他进屋，卡伊斯专注地看着父亲洗手洗脸，吃晚饭的时候，他也要坐在巴巴·阿尤布的身边。等到大伙都吃完了，巴巴·阿尤布便一边喝着茶，一边看着全家老小，憧憬着有朝一日，孩子们全都成了家，再生一堆娃儿给他，那会儿他就有了更大的一家子，得意洋洋地做起了老太爷。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It happened one day that a div came to Maidan Sabz. As it approached the village from the direction of the mountains, the earth shook with each of its footfalls. The villagers dropped their shovels and hoes and axes and scattered. They locked themselves in their homes and huddled with one another. When the deafening sounds of the div's footsteps stopped, the skies over Maidan Sabz darkened with its shadow. It was said that curved horns sprouted from its head and that coarse black hair covered its shoulders and powerful tail. They said its eyes shone red. No one knew for sure, you understand, at least no one living: The div ate on the spot those who dared steal so much as a single glance. Knowing this, the villagers wisely kept their eyes glued to the ground.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="出事的那一天，有个魔王来到了马伊丹·萨卜兹。它从山的方向走近村子，随着它的脚步，大地也在一次次地颤抖。村民们丢下铁锹、锄头和斧子，四散而逃。他们把自己锁在家里，抱成一团。魔王震耳欲聋的脚步声停止了，它的身影让马伊丹·萨卜兹的天空也变得昏暗。人家说它头上长着弯曲的犄角，粗硬的黑毛覆盖着肩膀和强健的尾巴。人家还说它两眼发着红光。可没人知道它确切的长相——你们肯定都懂的——至少没有活人知道：如果有人胆敢偷看，哪怕只看一眼，魔王也会立刻把他吃掉。村民们知道这一点，便明智地让眼睛死死盯着地面。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Everyone at the village knew why the div had come. They had heard the tales of its visits to other villages and they could only marvel at how Maidan Sabz had managed to escape its attention for so long. Perhaps, they reasoned, the poor, stringent lives they led in Maidan Sabz had worked in their favor, as their children weren't as well fed and didn't have as much meat on their bones. Even so, their luck had run out at last.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="村子里人人都知道魔王为什么驾到。他们听说过它光顾别村的故事，却惊讶于马伊丹·萨卜兹竟然能在这么长的时间里逃脱它的注意。他们琢磨，也许马伊丹·萨卜兹贫穷、严苛的生活反而成了优势，因为他们的孩子吃不饱，骨头上没多少肉。即使这样，他们的好运气也已经用光了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Maidan Sabz trembled and held its breath. Families prayed that the div would bypass their home for they knew that if the div tapped on their roof, they would have to give it one child. The div would then toss the child into a sack, sling the sack over its shoulder, and go back the way it had come. No one would ever see the poor child again. And if a household refused, the div would take all of its children.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="马伊丹·萨卜兹颤抖着，屏住了呼吸。家家都在祷告，巴望着魔王从自家门前跨过，因为他们知道，魔王叩响哪家的房顶，哪家就得交出一个小孩。魔王会把这孩子丢进口袋，再把口袋甩到肩后，原路返回，再也不会有人看见那可怜的小孩。如果家人拒绝就范，魔王会把这一家所有的孩子抓走。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So where did the div take the children to? To its fort, which sat atop a steep mountain. The div's fort was very far from Maidan Sabz. Valleys, several deserts, and two mountain chains had to be cleared before you could reach it. And what sane person would, only to meet death? They said the fort was full of dungeons where cleavers hung from walls. Meat hooks dangled from ceilings. They said there were giant skewers and fire pits. They said that if it caught a trespasser, the div was known to overcome its aversion to adult meat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那么魔王把小孩带到哪里去了？带到它位于峭壁之巅的城堡。魔王的城堡离马伊丹·萨卜兹非常遥远，你要经过几条山谷，几片沙漠，翻过两道山脉，才能到达。可是又有哪个神志正常的人会去送死呢？人家说，城堡遍布着地牢，地牢的墙上挂着切肉的刀，肉摇摇晃晃地吊在屋顶上。听说那里有巨大的烤肉叉和火盆子。还听说如果有人偷偷溜进去，被魔王抓住，那么它也会克服自己对大人肉的厌恶。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I guess you know which rooftop received the div's dreaded tap. Upon hearing it, Baba Ayub let an agonized cry escape from his lips, and his wife fainted cold.

<div class="line_en">What can I say to you of the anguish that Baba Ayub and his wife suffered that night? No parent should have to make a choice such as this. Out of the children's earshot, Baba Ayub and his wife debated what they should do. They talked and wept and talked and wept. All night, they went back and forth, and, as dawn neared, they had yet to reach a decision -- which was perhaps what the div wanted, as their indecision would allow it to take five children instead of one. In the end, Baba Ayub collected from just outside the house five rocks of identical size and shape. On the face of each he scribbled the name of one child, and when he was done he tossed the rocks into a burlap sack. When he offered the bag to his wife, she recoiled as though it held a venomous snake.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我该怎样告诉你们，巴巴·阿尤布和他妻子那天晚上遭受了多么大的痛苦啊？哪个父母都不应该被迫做这样的决定。巴巴·阿尤布和他妻子躲在孩子们听不到的地方，讨论该怎么办。两口子说着说着就哭起来，再说，再哭。整整一夜，他们翻来覆去，天将破晓时，还是拿不定主意。他们猜不出魔王想要哪个孩子，也没办法横下心来，让它把五个都带走，而不是只要一个。最后，巴巴·阿尤布从门口捡回五块石头，大小和形状都一样，每块都刻上一个孩子的名字，刻完了，就把它们丢进一个粗麻布口袋。他把口袋递给妻子，可她直往后躲，好像里面装着毒蛇。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I suppose you also know which rock Baba Ayub happened to pick. When he saw the name on it, he turned his face heavenward and let out a scream. With a broken heart, he lifted his youngest son into his arms, and Qais, who had blind trust in his father, happily wrapped his arms around Baba Ayub's neck. It wasn't until Baba Ayub deposited him outside the house and shut the door that the boy realized what was amiss, and there stood Baba Ayub, eyes squeezed shut, tears leaking from both, back against the door, as his beloved Qais pounded his small fists on it, crying for Baba to let him back in, and Baba Ayub stood there, muttering, "Forgive me, forgive me," as the ground shook with the div's footsteps, and his son screeched, and the earth trembled again and again as the div took its leave from Maidan Sabz, until at last it was gone, and the earth was still, and all was silence but for Baba Ayub, still weeping and asking Qais for forgiveness.</div>

<div class="line_en">Where was I? Ah yes. There followed a forty-day mourning period. Every day, neighbors cooked meals for the family and kept vigil with them. People brought over what offerings they could -- tea, candy, bread, almonds -- and they brought as well their condolences and sympathies. Baba Ayub could hardly bring himself to say so much as a word of thanks. He sat in a corner, weeping, streams of tears pouring from both eyes as though he meant to end the village's streak of droughts with them. You wouldn't wish his torment and suffering on the vilest of men.</div>

<div class="line_en">Several years passed. The droughts continued, and Maidan Sabz fell into even worse poverty. Several babies died of thirst in their cribs. The wells ran even lower and the river dried, unlike Baba Ayub's anguish, a river that swelled and swelled with each passing day. He was of no use to his family any longer. He didn't work, didn't pray, hardly ate. His wife and children pleaded with him, but it was no good. His remaining sons had to take over his work, for every day Baba Ayub did nothing but sit at the edge of his field, a lone, wretched figure gazing toward the mountains. He stopped speaking to the villagers, for he believed they muttered things behind his back. They said he was a coward for willingly giving away his son. That he was an unfit father. A real father would have fought the div. He would have died defending his family.</div>

When passersby asked where he was going, he told them, and some laughed, some hurried past for fear he was a madman, and some prayed for him, as they too had lost a child to the div. Baba Ayub kept his head down and walked. When his shoes fell apart, he fastened them to his feet with strings, and when the strings tore he pushed forward on bare feet.

<div class="line_en">At last he reached the mountain atop which sat the div's fort. So eager he was to fulfill his quest that he didn't rest and immediately began his climb, his clothes shredded, his feet bloodied, his hair caked with dust, but his resolve unshaken. The jagged rocks ripped his soles. Hawks pecked at his cheeks when he climbed past their nest. Violent gusts of wind nearly tore him from the side of the mountain. And still he climbed, from one rock to the next, until at last he stood before the massive gates of the div's fort.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后，他走到那座山下，山顶就是魔王的城堡。他太急于完成自己的远征了，于是没有歇息，便立刻开始攀爬。他的衣服已经褴褛不堪，双脚鲜血淋漓，头发被泥土粘在了一起，可他的决心没有动摇。岩石如锯齿，割破他的脚底。当他向上爬过鹰巢的时候，老鹰来啄他的脸颊。狂风凶猛，几乎将他掀落悬崖。可他还在攀爬，从一块岩石爬向另一块岩石，终于站到了魔王城堡雄伟的大门前。巴巴·阿尤布朝大门扔了块石头。">查看中文翻译</div>

To hold little Qais again, to kiss his cheek and feel the softness of his small hands in his own? And yet… If he took him home, what sort of life awaited Qais in Maidan Sabz? The hard life of a peasant at best, like his own, and little more. That is, if Qais didn't die from the droughts like so many of the village's children had. Could you forgive yourself, then, Baba Ayub asked himself, knowing that you plucked him, for your own selfish reasons, from a life of luxury and opportunity? On the other hand, if he left Qais behind, how could he bear it, knowing that his boy was alive, to know his whereabouts and yet be forbidden to see him? How could he bear it? Baba Ayub wept. He grew so despondent that he lifted the hourglass and hurled it at the wall, where it crashed into a thousand pieces and its fine sand spilled all over the floor.</div>

One day she was sitting on the dirt yet again, a prayer playing upon her lips, when she saw a thin figure approaching Maidan Sabz from the direction of the mountains. At first she took him for a lost dervish, a thin man with threadbare rags for clothing, hollow eyes and sunken temples, and it wasn't until he came closer yet that she recognized her husband.

Heavy, swollen raindrops rolled from the tips of leaves. The wells filled and the river rose. The hills to the east turned green. Wildflowers bloomed, and for the first time in many years children played on grass and cows grazed. Everyone rejoiced.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="开春了，马伊丹·萨卜兹的天空终于开裂。这一次落下的可不是过去那样的毛毛细雨，而是瓢泼大雨。豪雨从天空倾泻而下，焦渴的村民抖擞相迎。整整一天，水做的万千鼓槌不停敲击着马伊丹·萨卜兹的片片屋顶，淹没了世界上其他的一切声音。沉重、肥大的雨滴从叶梢滚落。井水满了，河水涨了，东山绿了，野花也开了。多年以来，孩子们头一次有了嬉戏的草地，母牛也第一次啃到了青草。人人欢欣。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When the rains stopped, the village had some work to do. Several mud walls had melted, and a few of the roofs sagged, and entire sections of farmland had turned into swamps. But after the misery of the devastating drought, the people of Maidan Sabz weren't about to complain. Walls were reerected, roofs repaired, and irrigation canals drained. That fall, Baba Ayub produced the most plentiful crop of pistachios of his life, and, indeed, the year after that, and the one following, his crops increased in both size and quality. In the great cities where he sold his goods, Baba Ayub sat proudly behind pyramids of his pistachios and beamed like the happiest man who walked the earth. No drought ever came to Maidan Sabz again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="雨终于停了，村民们还要忙活一阵。有的土坯墙倒了，有的房顶垮了，农田成了片片泽国。可是，经历了十年的苦难，马伊丹·萨卜兹的人们无意抱怨。墙重新砌起来了，房顶修好了，灌渠疏浚了。当年秋天，巴巴·阿尤布种的开心果取得了这辈子最好的一次收成，其实呢，在第二年，第三年，不论产量还是品相，他的收成都越来越好。巴巴·阿尤布去了大城市搞买卖，坐在他的开心果金字塔后面，脸上洋溢着笑容，仿佛全天下最幸福的汉子。马伊丹·萨卜兹再也没发生过旱灾。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There is little more to say, Abdullah. You may ask, though, did a young handsome man riding a horse ever pass through the village on his way to great adventures? Did he perhaps stop for a drink of water, of which the village had plenty now, and did he sit to break bread with the villagers, perhaps with Baba Ayub himself? I can't tell you, boy. What I can say is that Baba Ayub grew to be a very old man indeed. I can tell you that he saw his children married, as he had always wished, and I can say that his children bore him many children of their own, every one of whom brought Baba Ayub great happiness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没有多少可讲的了，阿卜杜拉。不过呢，也许你会问，有没有一个俊俏的青年，在展开伟大历险的途中，骑着马，经过这个村庄？他会不会停下来，在这如今水源丰沛的村子里喝口水？他会不会坐下来和村民们吃顿饭，说不准就在饭桌上遇见巴巴·阿尤布呢？儿子，我没法告诉你。我能说的就是，巴巴·阿尤布确实活得非常久，成了个很老很老的老头子。我可以告诉你，他如愿以偿，看到自己的孩子们都成了家。我还可以告诉你，孩子们又生了好多孩子给他，每一个都给巴巴·阿尤布带来了巨大的快乐。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And I can also tell you that some nights, for no particular reason, Baba Ayub couldn't sleep. Though he was a very old man now, he still had the use of his legs so long as he held a cane. And so on those sleepless nights he slipped from bed without waking his wife, fetched his cane, and left the house. He walked in the dark, his cane tapping before him, the night breeze stroking his face. There was a flat rock at the edge of his field and he lowered himself upon it. He often sat there for an hour or more, gazing up at the stars, the clouds floating past the moon. He thought about his long life and gave thanks for all the bounty and joy that he had been given. To want more, to wish for yet more, he knew, would be petty. He sighed happily, and listened to the wind sweeping down from the mountains, to the chirping of night birds.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="还有啊，我可以告诉你，在有些夜晚，不知道什么原因，巴巴·阿尤布就是睡不着。虽然这个时候他已经非常老了，可是只要拄着拐杖，他那两条腿就仍然派得上用场。所以，每逢睡不着觉的夜晚，他便从床上溜下来，悄悄地，免得把妻子吵醒。他拿上拐杖，走出家门。他在黑夜里行走，拐杖在身前点点戳戳，夜风拂面而来。他的地边上有块平平整整的大石头，他弯下腰坐到上面。他常常来这儿坐一坐，有时一个钟头，有时更久，凝望星空，看流云飘过月亮。他回想自己漫长的一生，感谢所受的恩惠和和喜乐。他懂得，再有更多的索要，更多的欲求，便未免过于厚颜。他幸福地叹了口气，再听山风瑟瑟，夜鸟啁啾。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But every once in a while, he thought he heard another noise among these. It was always the same, the high-pitched jingle of a bell. He didn't understand why he should hear such a noise, alone in the dark, all the sheep and goats sleeping. Sometimes he told himself he had heard no such thing, and sometimes he was so convinced to the contrary that he called out into the darkness, "Is someone out there? Who is there? Show yourself." But no reply ever came. Baba Ayub didn't understand. Just as he didn't understand why a wave of something, something like the tail end of a sad dream, always swept through him whenever he heard the jingling, surprising him each time like an unexpected gust of wind. But then it passed, as all things do. It passed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是每隔一会儿，他便觉得万籁之中，别有异声。那高亢的声音一成不变，是一只铃儿叮叮当当。所有的绵羊和山羊都在熟睡，他不明白为什么会听到这样的声音，孤孤单单地在黑暗中回响。有时他告诉自己，他并没有听到这声音，可有时他又确信无疑，便向黑暗中叫道：“有人吗？谁在那儿？出来啊。”可是从无应答。巴巴·阿尤布不明白。正如他不明白为什么一听到这铃声，便总有一道波浪，宛如苦梦的尾梢，从他周身横扫而过，每一次都像不期而至的狂风，吹得他心里一惊。可是随后它便过去了，像所有过去的事情一样。它过去了。">查看中文翻译</div>
