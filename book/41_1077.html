<div class="line_en">Then Father hit him again, harder, and this time across the left cheek. Abdullah's head snapped sideways. His face burned, and more tears leaked. His left ear rang.

<div class="line_en">From the bed of the wagon, Pari's hand quickly slipped into Abdullah's. She was looking up at him, her eyes liquid, and she was smiling her gap-toothed smile like no bad thing would ever befall her so long as he stood at her side. He closed his fingers around her hand, the way he did each night when he and his little sister slept in their cot, their skulls touching, their legs tangled.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="车斗里的帕丽赶快伸出一只手，阿卜杜拉把它握在掌中。她抬头看他，泪水涟涟，却在咧嘴笑着，好像只要阿卜杜拉站在身边，她就能远离一切灾殃。阿卜杜拉攥紧她的手。每天晚上，他和妹妹一起在小床上入睡时，也是这样手攥着手，脚缠着脚，头顶着头。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">From then on, he walked beside the wagon as it jostled along on the pitted desert floor, holding Pari's hand. They traded furtive happy glances, brother and sister, but said little for fear of souring Father's mood and spoiling their good fortune. For long stretches they were alone, the three of them, nothing and no one in sight but the deep copper gorges and vast sandstone cliffs. The desert unrolled ahead of them, open and wide, as though it had been created for them and them alone, the air still, blazing hot, the sky high and blue. Rocks shimmered on the cracked floor. The only sounds Abdullah heard were his own breathing and the rhythmic creaking of the wheels as Father pulled the red wagon north.</div>

<div class="line_en">Father looked down at them. His name was Saboor. He was dark-skinned and had a hard face, angular and bony, nose curved like a desert hawk's beak, eyes set deep in his skull. Father was thin as a reed, but a lifetime of work had made his muscles powerful, tightly wound like rattan strips around the arm of a wicker chair. "Tomorrow afternoon," he said, lifting the cowhide water bag to his lips. "If we make good time." He took a long swallow, his Adam's apple rising and dropping.</div>

<div class="line_en">Abdullah followed her finger, traced it to a spot in the shadow of the boulder where a feather lay, long, gray, like charcoal after it has burned. Abdullah walked over to it and picked it by the stem. He blew the flecks of dust off it. A falcon, he thought, turning it over. Maybe a dove, or a desert lark. He'd seen a number of those already that day. No, a falcon. He blew on it again and handed it to Pari, who happily snatched it from him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿卜杜拉顺着她手指的方向一路追赶，直到那片羽毛落入巨石的背阴，它长长的，灰灰的，仿佛烧过的木炭。阿卜杜拉走过去，拾起羽毛，捏住羽干，吹去上面的土。隼，他想，翻个面再看，也许是鸽子，要不就是漠百灵。今天他已经看见不少漠百灵了。不对，是隼。他又吹了吹，便把它递给帕丽，妹妹高兴地一把抓了过去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Back home, in Shadbagh, Pari kept underneath her pillow an old tin tea box Abdullah had given her. It had a rusty latch, and on the lid was a bearded Indian man, wearing a turban and a long red tunic, holding up a steaming cup of tea with both hands. Inside the box were all of the feathers that Pari collected. They were her most cherished belongings. Deep green and dense burgundy rooster feathers; a white tail feather from a dove; a sparrow feather, dust brown, dotted with dark blotches; and the one of which Pari was proudest, an iridescent green peacock feather with a beautiful large eye at the tip.</div>

<div class="line_en">This last was a gift Abdullah had given her two months earlier. He had heard of a boy from another village whose family owned a peacock. One day when Father was away digging ditches in a town south of Shadbagh, Abdullah walked to this other village, found the boy, and asked him for a feather from the bird. Negotiation ensued, at the end of which Abdullah agreed to trade his shoes for the feather. By the time he returned to Shadbagh, peacock feather tucked in the waist of his trousers beneath his shirt, his heels had split open and left bloody smudges on the ground. Thorns and splinters had burrowed into the skin of his soles. Every step sent barbs of pain shooting through his feet.</div>

<div class="line_en">When he arrived home, he found his stepmother, Parwana, outside the hut, hunched before the tandoor, making the daily naan. He quickly ducked behind the giant oak tree near their home and waited for her to finish. Peeking around the trunk, he watched her work, a thick-shouldered woman with long arms, rough-skinned hands, and stubby fingers; a woman with a puffed, rounded face who possessed none of the grace of the butterfly she'd been named after.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="回到家，他发现后娘帕尔瓦娜就在屋外，弓着背，在泥炉里烤当天的馕。他赶快躲到家门口的大橡树后面，等着她收工。他从树后窥视，看她忙忙活活。这女人虎背熊腰，胳膊长，手糙，指头短粗，一张浮肿的大脸盘子，虽然名叫蝴蝶，却没有一丝蝴蝶的优雅[1]。【注：[1]“帕尔瓦娜”是蝴蝶的意思。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Abdullah wished he could love her as he had his own mother. Mother, who had bled to death giving birth to Pari three and a half years earlier when Abdullah was seven.

<div class="line_en">He wished he could love his new mother in the same way. And perhaps Parwana, he thought, secretly wished the same, that she could love him. The way she did Iqbal, her one-year-old son, whose face she always kissed, whose every cough and sneeze she fretted over. Or the way she had loved her first baby, Omar. She had adored him. But he had died of the cold the winter before last. He was two weeks old. Parwana and Father had barely named him. He was one of three babies that brutal winter had taken in Shadbagh. Abdullah remembered Parwana clutching Omar's swaddled little corpse, her fits of grief. He remembered the day they buried him up on the hill, a tiny mound on frozen ground, beneath a pewter sky, Mullah Shekib saying the prayers, the wind spraying grits of snow and ice into everyone's eyes.</div>

<div class="line_en">Abdullah suspected Parwana would be furious later to learn that he had traded his only pair of shoes for a peacock feather. Father had labored hard under the sun to pay for them. She would let him have it when she found out. She might even hit him, Abdullah thought. She had struck him a few times before. She had strong, heavy hands -- from all those years of lifting her invalid sister, Abdullah imagined -- and they knew how to swing a broomstick or land a well-aimed slap.</div>

<div class="line_en">But to her credit, Parwana did not seem to derive any satisfaction from hitting him. Nor was she incapable of tenderness toward her stepchildren. There was the time she had sewn Pari a silver-and-green dress from a roll of fabric Father had brought from Kabul. The time she had taught Abdullah, with surprising patience, how to crack two eggs simultaneously without breaking the yolks. And the time she had shown them how to twist and turn husks of corn into little dolls, the way she had with her own sister when they were little. She showed them how to fashion dresses for the dolls out of little torn strips of cloth.</div>

<div class="line_en">But these were gestures, Abdullah knew, acts of duty, drawn from a well far shallower than the one she reached into for Iqbal. If one night their house caught fire, Abdullah knew without doubt which child Parwana would grab rushing out. She would not think twice. In the end, it came down to a simple thing: They weren't her children, he and Pari. Most people loved their own. It couldn't be helped that he and his sister didn't belong to her. They were another woman's leftovers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是阿卜杜拉明白，这些举动都是姿态，尽她的本分而已。井分两口，有深有浅，她给伊克巴尔的那口要深得多。如果哪天晚上家里着了火，阿卜杜拉想都不用想，就知道帕尔瓦娜会抱起哪个孩子往外跑，一点都不带犹豫。说千道万，事情是明摆着的：他们不是她的孩子。他和帕丽不是她的。大多数人爱的是自己的孩子。没办法，他和妹妹不属于她。他俩是另一个女人留下的累赘。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He waited for Parwana to take the bread inside, then watched as she reemerged from the hut, carrying Iqbal on one arm and a load of laundry under the other. He watched her amble in the direction of the stream and waited until she was out of sight before he sneaked into the house, his soles throbbing each time they met the ground. Inside, he sat down and slipped on his old plastic sandals, the only other footwear he owned. Abdullah knew it wasn't a sensible thing he had done. But when he knelt beside Pari, gently shook her awake from a nap, and produced the feather from behind his back like a magician, it was all worth it -- worth it for the way her face broke open with surprise first, then delight; for the way she stamped his cheeks with kisses; for how she cackled when he tickled her chin with the soft end of the feather -- and suddenly his feet didn't hurt at all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他等帕尔瓦娜拿着馕进屋，又等她出来。她一只胳膊抱着伊克巴尔，另一只胳膊底下夹着一大堆衣服。他看她慢慢走向河边，直到没了人影，这才溜回家。每一步踩到地上，脚底就一阵抽痛。一进屋他就坐下，换上他那双旧的塑料拖鞋。阿卜杜拉知道自己干了件很不明智的事，可等他跪到帕丽身边，轻轻把她从小睡中摇醒，像魔术师一样从背后变出那根大羽毛的时候，一切都是值得的了——值得让她露出先惊后喜的表情，值得让她在哥哥脸上一通猛亲，值得他用羽毛软软的一端轻轻刮她的下巴，逗得她咯咯乱笑。突然之间，他的脚一点也不疼了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Her hair reminded Abdullah of his mother's, and he ached for her all over again, for her gentleness, her inborn happiness, her bewilderment at people's cruelty. He remembered her hiccuping laughter, and the timid way she sometimes tilted her head. His mother had been delicate, both in stature and nature, a wispy, slim-waisted woman with a puff of hair always spilling from under her scarf. He used to wonder how such a frail little body could house so much joy, so much goodness. It couldn't. It spilled out of her, came pouring out her eyes. Father was different. Father had hardness in him. His eyes looked out on the same world as Mother's had, and saw only indifference. Endless toil. Father's world was unsparing. Nothing good came free. Even love. You paid for all things. And if you were poor, suffering was your currency. Abdullah looked down at the scabby parting in his little sister's hair, at her narrow wrist hanging over the side of the wagon, and he knew that in their mother's dying, something of her had passed to Pari.

Earlier in the day, they had passed by several villages, most of them far-flung and dusty just like Shadbagh. Small square-shaped homes made of baked mud, sometimes raised into the side of a mountain and sometimes not, ribbons of smoke rising from their roofs. Wash lines, women squatting by cooking fires. A few poplar trees, a few chickens, a handful of cows and goats, and always a mosque. The last village they passed sat adjacent to a poppy field, where an old man working the pods waved at them.

Uncle Nabi was a cook and a chauffeur in Kabul. Once a month, he drove from Kabul to visit them in Shadbagh, his arrival announced by a staccato of honks and the hollering of a horde of village kids who chased the big blue car with the tan top and shiny rims. They slapped the fender and windows until he killed the engine and emerged grinning from the car, handsome Uncle Nabi with the long sideburns and wavy black hair combed back from his forehead, dressed in his oversize olive-colored suit with white dress shirt and brown loafers.

Sometimes Father took Abdullah along on his jobs. They had picked apples once in a town that was a full day's walk away from Shadbagh. Abdullah remembered his father mounted on the ladder until sundown, his hunched shoulders, the creased back of his neck burning in the sun, the raw skin of his forearms, his thick fingers twisting and turning apples one at a time. They had made bricks for a mosque in another town. Father had shown Abdullah how to collect the good soil, the deep lighter-colored stuff. They had sifted the dirt together, added straw, and Father had patiently taught him to titrate the water so the mixture didn't turn runny. Over the last year, Father had lugged stones. He had shoveled dirt, tried his hand at plowing fields. He had worked on a road crew laying down asphalt.</div>

He said he had spent half his childhood in the shade of its massive crown or climbing its sweeping boughs. His own father, Abdullah's grandfather, had tied long ropes to one of the thick boughs and suspended a swing, a contraption that had survived countless harsh seasons and the old man himself.

When Pari was an infant, it was he she had awakened at night with her squeaks and mutters, he who had walked and bounced her in the dark. He had changed her soiled diapers. He had been the one to give Pari her baths. It wasn't Father's job to do -- he was a man -- and, besides, he was always too exhausted from work. And Parwana, already pregnant with Omar, was slow to rouse herself to Pari's needs. She never had the patience or the energy. Thus the care had fallen on Abdullah, but he didn't mind at all. He did it gladly. He loved the fact that he was the one to help with her first step, to gasp at her first uttered word. This was his purpose, he believed, the reason God had made him, so he would be there to take care of Pari when He took away their mother.</div>

But on occasion, for reasons unknown to Abdullah, something in Father unlocked and stories suddenly came spilling out.

Other times, he made up stories. He made them up on the spot, his tales unmasking a capacity for imagination and dream that always surprised Abdullah.

He had visited a few smaller towns on jobs with Father, but never a real city, and certainly nothing Uncle Nabi had said could have prepared him for the hustle and bustle of the biggest and busiest city of them all. Everywhere, he saw traffic lights, and teahouses, and restaurants, and glass-fronted shops with bright multicolored signs. Cars rattling noisily down the crowded streets, hooting, darting narrowly among buses, pedestrians, and bicycles. Horse-drawn garis jingled up and down boulevards, their iron-rimmed wheels bouncing on the road. The sidewalks he walked with Pari and Father were crowded with cigarette and chewing-gum sellers, magazine stands, blacksmiths pounding horseshoes. At intersections, traffic policemen in ill-fitting uniforms blew their whistles and made authoritative gestures that no one seemed to heed.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Look, Abollah," Pari said, pointing to a shop across the street. In its window stood a young woman dressed in a beautifully embroidered green dress with small mirrors and beads. She wore a long matching scarf, with silver jewelry and deep red trousers. She stood perfectly still, gazing indifferently at passersby without once blinking. She didn't move so much as a finger as Abdullah and Pari finished their beans, and remained motionless after that too. Up the block, Abdullah saw a huge poster hanging from the façade of a tall building. It showed a young, pretty Indian woman in a tulip field, standing in a downpour of rain, ducking playfully behind some kind of bungalow. She was grinning shyly, a wet sari hugging her curves. Abdullah wondered if this was what Uncle Nabi had called a cinema, where people went to watch films, and hoped that in the coming month Uncle Nabi would take him and Pari to see a film. He grinned at the thought.</div>

<div class="line_en">The house proved even more impressive once Uncle Nabi led Abdullah, Pari, and Father inside. Abdullah estimated its size big enough to contain at least half the homes in Shadbagh. He felt as though he had stepped into the div's palace. The garden, at the far back, was beautifully landscaped, with rows of flowers in all colors, neatly trimmed, with knee-high bushes and peppered with fruit trees -- Abdullah recognized cherry, apple, apricot, and pomegranate. A roofed porch led into the garden from the house -- Uncle Nabi said it was called a veranda -- and was enclosed by a low railing covered with webs of green vines. On their way to the room where Mr. and Mrs. Wahdati awaited their arrival, Abdullah spied a bathroom with the porcelain toilet Uncle Nabi had told them about, as well as a glittering sink with bronze-colored faucets. Abdullah, who spent hours every week lugging buckets of water from Shadbagh's communal well, marveled at a life where water was just a twist of the hand away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当纳比舅舅领着阿卜杜拉、帕丽和父亲进了门，他们才发现，这房子比原来想像的还要气派。阿卜杜拉估摸着，它大得足以装下沙德巴格至少一半的人家。他感觉自己仿佛走进了魔王的宫殿。房后还有花园，打理得非常漂亮，种着成排的鲜花，什么颜色都有，修剪得整整齐齐，还有齐膝高的矮树丛，果树也到处都是——阿卜杜拉认出了樱桃树、苹果树、杏树和石榴树。走廊建在屋外，盖有顶棚，直入花园——纳比舅舅说它叫游廊——旁边的栏杆上爬满了绿色的藤蔓。瓦赫达提先生和瓦赫达提太太正在里屋等着他们。进屋之前，阿卜杜拉偷偷看了一眼厕所，里面有纳比舅舅说过的陶瓷马桶，亮闪闪的洗脸池，配着古铜色的水龙头。在沙德巴格，每个礼拜，阿卜杜拉都要花上好几个小时，从公共水井里成桶成桶地提水，可人家只需伸手一拧，就能来水，这样的生活不免让他大为惊奇。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now they sat on a bulky couch with gold tassels, Abdullah, Pari, and Father. The soft cushions at their backs were dotted with tiny octagonal mirrors. Across from the couch, a single painting took up most of the wall. It showed an elderly stone carver, bent over his workbench, pounding a block of stone with a mallet. Pleated burgundy drapes dressed the wide windows that opened onto a balcony with a waist-high iron railing. Everything in the room was polished, free of dust.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此刻，阿卜杜拉、帕丽和父亲坐在一个有金色流苏的大沙发上，背后是软乎乎的靠垫，上面有很多小小的八角形亮片。沙发对面，一幅画占去了大部分墙面，画的是一个上了年纪的石雕匠，伏在工作台前，正用木锤敲一块大石头。窗子宽大，配有带褶裥的窗帘，敞开着，窗外是装有齐腰高铁护栏的阳台。这房间里的一切都光亮而一尘不染。">查看中文翻译</div>

He had narrow shoulders, thin lips, and a high shiny forehead.

<div class="line_en">Abdullah stole a glance at her, at her thin waist, her small, pretty mouth and perfectly arched eyebrows, her pink toenails and matching lipstick. He remembered her now from a couple of years earlier, when Pari was almost two. Uncle Nabi had brought her to Shadbagh because she had said she wanted to meet his family. She had worn a peach dress without sleeves -- he remembered the look of astonishment on Father's face -- and dark sunglasses with thick white rims. She smiled the whole time, asking questions about the village, their lives, asking after the children's names and ages. She acted like she belonged there in their low-ceilinged mud house, her back against a wall black with soot, sitting next to the flyspecked window and the cloudy plastic sheet that separated the main room from the kitchen, where Abdullah and Pari also slept. She had made a show of the visit, insisting on taking off her high-heeled shoes at the door, choosing the floor when Father had sensibly offered her a chair. Like she was one of them. He was only eight then, but Abdullah had seen through it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿卜杜拉偷偷看了她一眼，看她细细的腰，她漂亮的小嘴儿和完美的弯眉，她粉红的指甲和粉红的唇膏。现在他记起她来了。那是两年前，帕丽还不到两岁的时候，纳比舅舅带她到了沙德巴格，因为她说，她想见见他的家属。她穿着一条桃红色的无袖长裙——他记得父亲脸上那惊愕的表情——戴一副黑色的太阳镜，宽宽的白色镜框。她始终面带微笑，问这问那，问村子怎么样啊，生活怎么样啊，还问孩子们都叫什么名字，几岁了。举手投足之间，就好像她也属于这里，也住这样低矮的泥屋。她背倚着煤烟熏黑的墙，坐在蝇屎斑斑的窗边，一大张黑不溜秋的塑料布隔开了主屋和厨房——厨房也是阿卜杜拉和帕丽睡觉的地方。她把这次串门弄得风风光光，非要在门口脱掉高跟鞋，不要父亲自作聪明拿来的椅子，而是席地而坐，就好像她也是农民的一员。阿卜杜拉那时候只有八岁，可也能看出其中的名堂。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">What Abdullah remembered most about the visit was how Parwana -- who had been pregnant with Iqbal then -- had remained a shrouded figure, sitting in a corner in stiff silence, shriveled up into a ball. She had sat with her shoulders gathered, feet tucked beneath her swollen belly, like she was trying to disappear into the wall. Her face was shielded from view with a soiled veil. She held a knotted clump of it under her chin. Abdullah could almost see the shame rising from her, like steam, the embarrassment, how small she felt, and he had felt a surprising swell of sympathy for his stepmother.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="想起那次串门，阿卜杜拉记得最清楚的，就是帕尔瓦娜像裹了尸衣一样的窘态。她当时怀着伊克巴尔，呆坐在角落里，一声也不吭，身体缩成了一个圆球。她就那样坐着，双肩收紧，两脚塞在隆起的肚子下，好像要努力缩进墙里，消失不见。一条脏兮兮的面纱像盾牌一样挡住她的脸。她紧紧抓着下巴底下的面纱，把它拧成了乱糟糟的一堆。阿卜杜拉仿佛看到，羞耻如水汽般从她身上蒸腾而起，看到她自觉何其渺小的那份难堪，他心头涌起了一种对后妈的同情，这种感觉让他自己也觉得惊讶。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Now, beneath a stone-colored sky, men were striking at the felled trunk, their noses and cheeks flushed in the cold, their blades echoing hollowly when they hit the wood. Farther up the tree, Abdullah snapped small branches off the big ones. The first of the winter snow had fallen two days before. Not heavy, not yet, only a promise of things to come. Soon, winter would descend on Shadbagh, winter and its icicles and weeklong snowdrifts and winds that cracked the skin on the back of hands in a minute flat.

It had four deep pockets that snapped open and shut and a quilted hood that tightened around Abdullah's face when he drew its cords.

He would walk as far from Shadbagh as his feet would take him. And if one day, trekking across some vast open field, despair should take hold of him, he would stop in his tracks and shut his eyes and he would think of the falcon feather Pari had found in the desert. He would picture the feather coming loose from the bird, up in the clouds, half a mile above the world, twirling and spinning in violent currents, hurled by gusts of blustering wind across miles and miles of desert and mountains, to finally land, of all places and against all odds, at the foot of that one boulder for his sister to find.
