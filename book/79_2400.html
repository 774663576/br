<div class="line_en">As the number 2 rose on the shaft wall, he threw the brass handle back to the home position and the elevator car creaked to a stop. He took his Excedrin from his pocket, shook three of them into his hand, and opened the elevator door. Nothing in the Overlook frightened him. He felt that he and it were simpatico.</div>

<div class="line_en">He took the elevator up and it was strange, because none of them had used the elevator since they moved in. He threw the brass handle over and it wheezed vibratoriously up the shaft, the brass grate rattling madly. Wendy had a true claustrophobe's horror of the elevator, he knew. She envisioned the three of them trapped in it between floors while the winter storms raged outside, she could see them growing thinner and weaker, starving to death. Or perhaps dining on each other, the way those Rugby players had. He remembered a bumper sticker he had seen in Boulder, RUGBY PLAYERS EAT THEIR OWN DEAD. He could think of others. YOU ARE WHAT YOU EAT. Or menu items. Welcome to the Overlook Dining Room, Pride of the Rockies. Eat in Splendor at the Roof of the World. Human Haunch Broiled Over Matches La Specialite de la Maison. The contemptuous smile flicked over his features again.</div>

<div class="line_en">He frowned, feeling a wave of irritation and even real anger. Whatever had come of it, the boy had been trespassing. He had been told, and told bluntly, that certain areas of the hotel were off limits: the equipment shed, the basement, and all of the guest rooms. He would talk to Danny about that just as soon as the boy was over his fright. He would talk to him reasonably but sternly. There were plenty of fathers who would have done more than just talk.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他皱了皱眉，感到十分恼火，真有些生气了。不管结果如何，那孩子总归犯了越轨的错误。他告诉过他，明明白白地告诉过他，饭店的有些地方他是不能去的：工具棚，地下室，所有的客房。等丹尼从受惊状态中恢复过来，他会和他谈谈这件事的，通情达理、严肃认真地和他谈谈。换了别的父亲，可能就不仅仅是谈一谈的问题了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He walked up the hall flipping his Excedrin into his mouth and chewing them one by one. He rounded the corner into the short corridor off the main hall. The door to Room 217 was ajar, and the passkey hung from the lock on its white paddle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他沿着过道走去，把药片抛进嘴里，一片一片地嚼起来。他转过拐角，离开主过道进入短走廊。217房间的门半开着，万能钥匙吊在锁上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They would have administered a good shaking, and perhaps that was what Danny needed. If the boy had gotten a scare, wasn't that at least his just deserts?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们会好好收拾他一顿的，也许这正是丹尼需要的。如果说这孩子确实受了惊吓，难道这不是他应得的惩罚吗？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He walked down to the door, removed the passkey, dropped it into his pocket, and stepped inside. The overhead light was on. He glanced at the bed, saw it was not rumpled, and then walked directly across to the bathroom door. A curious certainty had grown in him. Although Watson had mentioned no names or room numbers, Jack felt sure that this was the room the lawyer's wife and her stud had shared, that this was the bathroom where she had been found dead, full of barbiturates and Colorado Lounge booze.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他来到门边，拔出钥匙，把钥匙放进口袋里，然后推门进去。顶灯亮着。他往床上望了一眼，床没乱，然后直接向浴室走去。他心里滋生出了一种奇怪的感觉：虽然沃森没有提到姓名和房间号，但他确信这就是律师的老婆和她的美男子共享的那个房间，人们就是在这间浴室里发现了她的尸体——肚子里装满了安眠药和科罗拉多休息厅的美酒。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The shower curtain, a pallid pastel pink, was drawn protectively around the long claw-footed tub.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="粉红色的淋浴帘子严严实实地拉在爪形足支撑的长浴缸周围。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And for the first time he felt his new sense of sureness (almost cockiness) that had come over him when Danny ran to him shouting. It was her! It was her! deserting him. A chilled finger pressed gently against the base of his spine, cooling him off ten degrees. It was joined by others and they suddenly rippled all the way up his back to his medulla oblongata, playing his spine like a jungle instrument.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他第一次感到，丹尼喊着“是她！是她！”向他奔去时他心里陡然升起的那种近乎趾高气扬的感觉正在弃他而去。一只冰凉的手指轻轻压在了他脊梁根上，他的体温骤然下降了10度。接着，其他手指也加入进来，突然像弹钢琴一样向上拂去，直达后颈窝。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He pushed the mirror-backed bathroom door open and stepped through. The light in here was off. He turned it on and observed the long, Pullman-car room, furnished in the distinctive early nineteen-hundreds-remodeled-in-the-twenties style that seemed common to all Overlook bathrooms, except for the ones on the third floor -- those were properly Byzantine, as befitted the royalty, politicians, movie stars, and capos who had stayed there over the years.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他推开背后装着镜子的浴室门，踏了进去。里面的灯没开，他打开灯，打量着那间长长的像普尔曼轿车的房间，室内装饰很有特色，属于那种现代化了的19世纪早期风格，除了四楼，其他楼层的客房浴室都是这个样子。四楼浴室是拜占庭风格的，这倒和多年来光顾这些房间的王室成员、政客、电影明星和大亨们的身份相符。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His anger at Danny evaporated, and as he stepped forward and pushed the shower curtain back his mouth was dry and he felt only sympathy for his son and terror for himself.</div>

<div class="line_en">Relief and irritation vented in a sudden "Pah!" sound that escaped his compressed lips like a very small explosive. The tub had been scrubbed clean at the end of the season; except for the rust stain under the twin faucets, it sparkled. There was a faint but definable smell of cleanser, the kind that can irritate your nose with the smell of its own righteousness for weeks, even months, after it has been used.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="随着一声清脆的“呸！”，他绷紧的神经顿时松弛下来。浴缸上个季节结束的时候被刷洗得干干净净的，除了那一对水龙头下的锈迹外，到处都在闪光。浴室里有一股淡淡的但仍可辨别出的清洁剂气味，是那种能维持数周乃至数月之久的、自以为天生比别人干净的气味。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The tub was dry and empty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="浴缸里干干的，什么都没有。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He bent down and ran his fingertips along the bottom of the tub. Dry as a bone. Not even a hint of moisture. The boy had been either hallucinating or outright lying. He felt angry again. That was when the bathmat on the floor caught his attention. He frowned down at it. What was a bathmat doing in here?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他弯下腰，用指尖在浴缸底上摸了摸，一点湿气都没有。这孩子要么中了邪，要么纯粹是在撒谎。他感到怒气又升上来了，这时，地板上的防滑垫引起了他的注意。他皱了皱眉，防滑垫放在这里干什么？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It should be down in the linen cupboard at the end of the wing with the rest of the sheets and towels and pillow slips. All the linen was supposed to be there.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="它应该跟床单、毛巾、枕套一起呆在楼层尽头的被服间里，所有的衣物被服都应该放在那儿。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Not even the beds were really made up in these guest rooms; the mattresses had been zipped into clear plastic and then covered with bedspreads. He supposed Danny might have gone down and gotten it -- the passkey would open the linen cupboard -- but why? He brushed the tips of his fingers back and forth across it. The bathmat was bone dry.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="连客房的床上都没放被子——床垫封在透明的大塑料袋里，上面只铺着床罩。他猜，也许是丹尼拿来的（万能钥匙也能打开被服间），可是，他拿来干什么？他用指尖来回摸了一遍，防滑垫也是干干爽爽的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The boy had been dreaming. There was not a thing out of place. It was a little puzzling about the bathmat, granted, but the logical explanation was that some chambermaid, hurrying like mad on the last day of the season, had just forgotten to pick it up. Other than that, everything was -- His nostrils flared a little. Disinfectant, that self-righteous smell, cleaner -- than -- thou. And -- Soap?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这孩子一定是在做梦。一切都好好的，没有什么异样之处。是的，防滑垫的事有点蹊跷，但也可以做出合乎逻辑的解释：上个季节的最后一天，一位忙得不亦乐乎的服务员小姐忘了把它收起来。除了这件事，一切——他的鼻翼微微翕动了一下。消毒剂的气味，那种自以为高尚的气味，天生比－你－干－净。还有——肥皂？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He went back to the bathroom door and stood in it. Everything was all right.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他转身往外走去，在门口又停了下来。一切正常。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">(It's nothing. It's your imagination.)</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="（什么都没有。全是你的胡思乱想。）">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Surely not. But once the smell had been identified, it was too clear to dismiss. Soap. And not one of those postcard-size bars of Ivory they provide you with in hotels and motels, either. This scent was light and perfumed, a lady's soap. It had a pink sort of smell. Camay or Lowila, the brand that Wendy had always used in Stovington.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="肯定没有。可是，这种气味一旦被辨别出来，你就总能闻到它。是的，是香皂，而且不是旅馆提供的那种明信片大小的象划牌香皂。这种香皂的气味淡雅清香，是女士香皂。凯梅牌或罗薇拉牌，温迪在斯托文顿常用这两种牌子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He crossed jerkily to the door which gave on the hall, feeling the irregular thump of a headache beginning at his temples. Too much had happened today, too much by far. He wouldn't spank the boy or shake him, just talk to him, but by God, he wasn't going to add Room 217 to his problems. Not on the basis of a dry bathmat and a faint smell of Lowila soap. He -- There was a sudden rattling, metallic sound behind him. It came just as his hand closed around the doorknob, and an observer might have thought the brushed steel of the knob carried an electric charge. He jerked convulsively, eyes widening, other facial features drawing in, grimacing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他急匆匆地向客房外门走去，感觉到太阳穴又开始突突地乱跳起来。今天的麻烦事已经够多了，太多太多了。他不会打孩子的屁股，也不会揍他，跟他谈谈就行了，凭上帝发誓，他不打算让217房间再给他增添麻烦，不仅仅根据一张干防滑垫和一股淡淡的罗薇拉香皂味就自寻烦恼，他——突然，他身后哗啦地响了一声。声音传来时，他的手刚好握住了门上的球形把手，他全身一阵颤抖（旁人会以为钢把手上的静电打了他），眼睛瞪得老大，其他面部器官都皱缩起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="粉红色的塑料帘子后面有个什么东西，浴缸里有个什么东西。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The shower curtain, which he had pushed back to look into the tub, was now drawn. The metallic rattle, which had sounded to him like a stir of bones in a crypt, had been the curtain rings on the overhead bar. Jack stared at the curtain. His face felt as if it had been heavily waxed, all dead skin on the outside, live, hot rivulets of fear on the inside. The way he had felt on the playground.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="刚才他检查浴缸时拉开的淋浴帘子居然合上了。哗啦声（在他听来有如墓穴里的尸骨的一阵骚动声）是帘环在横竿上滑动时发出的声音。杰克盯着淋浴帘子，觉得自己的脸上好像涂上了一层厚厚的蜡，表面是一层僵死的皮肤，皮下涌动着恐惧的热流——跟他在游乐场上的感觉一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then he had control of himself, a little, anyway, and he let 90 of the doorknob and turned carefully around. His joints creaked. He began to walk back to the bathroom door, step by leaden step.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着，他稍稍恢复了镇定。他放开门把手，小心翼翼地转过身去，全身的关节都在嘎巴作响。他又向浴室门走去，一步比一步沉重，腿上像灌了铅一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jack told himself to step forward boldly and rake the shower curtain back. To expose whatever might be there. Instead he turned with jerky, marionette strides, his heart whamming frightfully in his chest, and went back into the bed/sitting room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杰克在心里怂恿自己大胆地上前去扯开淋浴帘子，不管里面是什么东西都让它现出原形来。但是，他却猛地转过身，迈着木偶一样的步子回到起居室里，心脏咚咚地狂跳着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He could see it, ill defined and obscure through the plastic, a nearly amorphous shape. It could have been anything. A trick of the light. The shadow of the shower attachment. A woman long dead and reclining in her bath, a bar of Lowila in one stiffening hand as she waited patiently for whatever lover might come.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他看见了那个东西，隔着塑料帘子看上去轮廓不那么分明，形状几乎毫无规则。什么东西都有可能是：可能是光线的作祟，可能是淋浴室附属物的影子，也可能是一具已经死了很长时间的女尸，斜倚在浴缸里，僵硬的手里抓着一块罗薇拉香皂，耐心地等待着无论哪一位情人的到来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He fumbled at the passkey. It seemed sludgy, unwilling to turn in the lock. He attacked the passkey. The tumblers suddenly fell and he stepped back against the corridor's far wall, a little groan of relief escaping him. He closed his eyes and all the old phrases began to parade through his mind, it seemed there must be hundreds of them, (cracking up not playing with a full deck lostya marbles guy just went loony tunes he went up and over the high side went bananas lost his football crackers nuts half a seabag) all meaning the same thing: losing your mind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他捣鼓着万能钥匙。钥匙有点涩，不肯转动。他敲了敲，锁栓突然落下去了。他向后退了几步，靠在背后的墙壁上，稍稍松了一口气。闭上眼，成百上千句话在他脑海里一一经过，意思却只有一个：你快发疯了。">查看中文翻译</div>

From inside, he seemed to hear an odd wet thumping sound, far off, dim, as if something had just scrambled belatedly out of the tub, as if to greet a caller, as if it had realized the caller was leaving before the social amenities had been completed and so it was now rushing to the door, all purple and grinning, to invite the caller back inside. Perhaps forever.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他慌慌张张地关上灯，走出门去，进入过道，拉上门，一眼也没往后看。他仿佛听到房间里传来了一声闷响，远远的，模模糊糊的，好像什么东西刚刚爬出了浴缸，它耽误了一点时间，得赶快去迎接一位来客，免得没尽到社交礼节，客人就走了，因此，它向门口飞奔而来，全身青肿，嘴上挂着狞笑，它要恳请客人回屋去。也许永远不再出来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But below the tumble of his chaotic thoughts, below the triphammer beat of his heart, he could hear the soft and futile sound of the doorknob being turned to and fro as something locked in tried helplessly to get out, something that wanted to meet him, something that would like to be introduced to his family as the storm shrieked around them and white daylight became black night. If he opened his eyes and saw that doorknob moving he would go mad. So he kept them shut, and after an unknowable time, there was stillness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，尽管思绪杂乱无章，尽管心跳急速狂乱，他还是能听到门把手来回转动时发出的轻微而徒劳的声音——反锁在房间里的那个东西想出来。它想跟他会面，它十分愿意和他的家人相识，在这暴风雪狂啸不止的时刻，在这白昼将尽、黑夜降临的时刻。假如他睁开眼睛，看到门把手在转动，他一定会发疯的，因此，他宁愿闭眼静候它的到来。不知道过了多久，四周安静了下来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">His feet were moving (feets don't fail me now) before he realized it. He turned them away from the door and walked down to the main hall, his feet whispering on the blue-black jungle carpet. He stopped halfway to the stairs and looked at the fire extinguisher. He thought that the folds of canvas were arranged in a slightly different manner. And he was quite sure that the brass nozzle had been pointing toward the elevator when he came up the hall.
