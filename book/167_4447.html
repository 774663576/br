<div class="line_en">"Commendable," Tyrion admitted, breaking a large brown egg that reminded him unduly of the Grand Maester's bald spotted head. "I take a different view. If there is food I eat it, in case there is none on the morrow." He smiled. "Tell me, are your ravens early risers as well?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“令人钦佩。”提利昂承认，并敲开一颗棕色的大蛋，心里觉得这颗蛋还真像大学士布满斑点的秃头。“但我看法不同。我是能吃的时候尽量吃，以免明天吃不到。”他露出微笑，“说说，您的乌鸦也这么早起吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I do not sleep as I did when I was younger," Grand Maester Pycelle told him, by way of apology for the dawn meeting. "I would sooner be up, though the world be dark, than lie restless abed, fretting on tasks undone," he said -- though his heavy-lidded eyes made him look half-asleep as he said it. In the airy chambers beneath the rookery, his girl served them boiled eggs, stewed plums, and porridge, while Pycelle served the pontifications. "In these sad times, when so many hunger, I think it only fitting to keep my table spare."</div>

<div class="line_en">"I am here to serve." The maester pushed himself ponderously to his feet his chain of office clinking softly. It was a heavy thing, a dozen maester's collars threaded around and through each other and ornamented with gemstones. And it seemed to Tyrion that the gold and silver and platinum links far outnumbered those of baser metals.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我随时任您差遣。”学士蹒跚起身，颈链轻声作响。他的颈链粗大沉重，重量乃是普通学士项链的十数倍，互相串接，镶以宝石。在提利昂看来，其中黄金、白银和铂金的链条数目远远超过其他不值钱的金属。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"For the eyes of Doran Martell, Prince of Dorne." Tyrion peeled the cracked shell away from his egg and took a bite. It wanted salt. "One letter, in two copies. Send your swiftest birds. The matter is of great import."</div>

<div class="line_en">Pycelle moved so slowly that Tyrion had time to finish his egg and taste the plums -- overcooked and watery, to his taste -- before the sound of wings prompted him to rise. He spied the raven, dark in the dawn sky, and turned briskly toward the maze of shelves at the far end of the room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="派席尔动作很慢，提利昂吃完煮蛋，又尝过李子——李子煮得烂熟多汁，正合他胃口——这才听见扑翅之音。他站起来，看见清晨天际乌鸦墨黑的身影，便骤然转身，朝房间远端迷宫般的置物架走去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Standing on his toes and straining upward, he managed to pull a small dusty bottle off the high shelf. When he read the label, he smiled and slipped it up his sleeve.</div>

<div class="line_en">He was back at the table peeling another egg when Grand Maester Pycelle came creeping down the stairs. "It is done, my lord." The old man seated himself. "A matter like this… best done promptly, indeed, indeed… of great import, you say?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当派席尔大学士慢吞吞地走下楼梯时，他已经坐回桌边，吃起另一颗蛋。“大人，已经办妥了。”老人坐下来，“这种事…是啊，是啊，办得越快越好…您说，事关重大？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, yes." The porridge was too thick, Tyrion felt, and wanted butter and honey. To be sure, butter and honey were seldom seen in King's Landing of late, though Lord Gyles kept them well supplied in the castle. Half of the food they ate these days came from his lands or Lady Tanda's. Rosby and Stokeworth lay near the city to the north, and were yet untouched by war.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“噢，没错。”提利昂嫌燕麦粥太稠，且缺了奶油和蜂蜜。这阵子，君临城中已经很难吃到奶油和蜂蜜，但拜盖尔斯伯爵之赐，城堡里的供应倒不缺。最近城堡中的粮食有一半是从他和坦妲伯爵夫人的领地运来。罗斯比城和史铎克渥斯堡位于王城以北，尚未遭战火波及。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The maester's medicines made an impressive display; dozens of pots sealed with wax, hundreds of stoppered vials, as many milkglass bottles, countless jars of dried herbs, each container neatly labeled in Pycelle's precise hand. An orderly mind, Tyrion reflected, and indeed, once you puzzled out the arrangement, it was easy to see that every potion had its place. And such interesting things. He noted sweetsleep and nightshade, milk of the poppy, the tears of Lys, powdered greycap, wolfsbane and demon's dance, basilisk venom, blindeye, widow's blood…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="学士的药品为数惊人：几十个蜡封的罐子，百余瓶塞住的小瓶，同样数量的白玻璃瓶，不计其数的干药草罐，每个容器上都有派席尔用工整的字迹写成的精确标签。此人真是井井有条，提利昂心想。的确，一旦你理解了分类依据，便会发现每种药品都摆放得恰到好处。真是些有趣的东西：甜睡花和龙葵、罂粟花奶、里斯之泪、灰蕈粉、附子草和鬼舞草、石蜥毒、瞎眼毒，寡妇之血…">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Pycelle dropped his gaze back to his food. Something about Tyrion's mismatched green-and-black eyes made men squirm; knowing that, he made good use of them. "Ah," the old man muttered into his plums. "Doubtless you have the right of it, my lord. It is most considerate of you to… spare her this… burden."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="派席尔急忙垂下视线，看着自己的早餐。有的人看了他那对大小不一，一绿一黑的眼睛便会不舒服；他很清楚这一点，因此善加利用。“啊，”老人对着自己的李子喃喃道，“大人您说得一点没错。为她省去这些…负担…您真是太体贴了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

He swung his legs out and clambered down from his chair. "Be so good as to inform me at once should we receive a reply from Dorne?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="得了，她是脆弱的白鸽？去问问艾德·史塔克吧！“知道您和我一样关心她，我实在倍感欣慰。感谢您的盛情款待，不过我今天还有事要忙。”他扭扭腿，爬下椅子，“等我们收到多恩方面的回信，劳烦您立刻通知我啰？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He waddled out into the lower bailey; his stunted legs complained of the steps. The sun was well up now, and the castle was stirring. Guardsmen walked the walls, and knights and men-at-arms were training with blunted weapons. Nearby, Bronn sat on the lip of a well. A pair of comely serving girls sauntered past carrying a wicker basket of rushes between them, but the sellsword never looked. "Bronn, I despair of you." Tyrion gestured at the wenches. "With sweet sights like that before you, all you see is a gaggle of louts raising a clangor."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他跛着脚走进下层庭院，畸形的双腿因为楼梯而酸痛。此刻，太阳已高挂天际，城堡里也活络了起来。守卫们在城墙上巡逻，骑士和他们的随从则以钝器练习战技。波隆就在广场附近，坐在一口井边，两个漂亮女侍合力提着一个装满毯子的柳条篮轻步走过，佣兵却目不斜视。“波隆，你真是没救了，”提利昂指指两个女孩，“大好春光就在眼前，你却光顾着看一群呆头鹅打架。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"There are a hundred whorehouses in this city where a clipped copper will buy me all the cunt I want," Bronn answered, "but one day my life may hang on how close I've watched your louts." He stood. "Who's the boy in the checkered blue surcoat with the three eyes on his shield?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“城里有一百间便宜妓院，花上几个铜板，我爱怎么干就怎么干。”波隆回答，“可哪天从这群呆头鹅身上学到的东西却可能救我一命。”他站起来，“那个穿蓝格子外衣，盾牌上有三只眼睛的小鬼是谁？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“某位雇佣骑士，自称塔拉德。你问这干嘛？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He's pledged to Joffrey; he's not like to face you." They set off across the bailey, Bronn matching his long stride to Tyrion's short one. These days the sellsword was looking almost respectable. His dark hair was washed and brushed, he was freshly shaved, and he wore the black breastplate of an officer of the City Watch. From his shoulders trailed a cloak of Lannister crimson patterned with golden hands. Tyrion had made him a gift of it when he named him captain of his personal guard. "How many supplicants do we have today?" he inquired.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他已经宣誓效忠乔佛里，应该不会跟你对上。”他们一同穿过庭院，波隆放慢脚步，以配合提利昂的短腿。最近这位佣兵看来已经有些人样：黑发梳洗整齐，胡子剃得干净，身上穿着都城守备队军官的黑色胸甲，一件兰尼斯特家的深红底金手披风自肩头垂下，提利昂任命他为自己侍卫队长的那天，送他这件披风作礼物。“今天有多少人请愿？”他问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Bronn pushed a fall of hair from his eyes. "He's the best of them. But watch him, he falls into a rhythm, delivering the same strokes in the same order each time he attacks." He grinned. "That will be the death of him, the day he faces me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="波隆拨开遮住眼睛的一搓头发，“这里面，他最行。可你仔细瞧瞧，他的行动有一定的节奏，每次攻击都依相同的顺序使用相同的招式，”他嘿嘿一笑，“哪天他跟我对上，就会因此没命。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"-- her daughter," Tyrion finished sourly. Since the hour he had arrived in the Red Keep, Lady Tanda had been stalking him, armed with a never-ending arsenal of lamprey pies, wild boars, and savory cream stews. Somehow she had gotten the notion that a dwarf lordling would be the perfect consort for her daughter Lollys, a large, soft, dim-witted girl who rumor said was still a maid at thirty-and-three. "Send her my regrets."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“——她女儿。”提利昂嫌恶地说完。自他抵达红堡的那一刻起，坦妲伯爵夫人便穷追不舍，轮番祭出鳗鱼派、野猪肉和美味的奶油浓汤当武器。她的女儿洛丽丝不但生得肥胖、柔弱而蠢笨，而且谣传三十三岁了还是个处女，可她不知怎地却认定侏儒少爷和自己女儿是天生绝配。“回复她，我很抱歉无法赴宴。”">查看中文翻译</div>

A clever, smiling, genial man, everyone's friend, always able to find whatever gold the king or his Hand required, and yet of such undistinguished birth, one step up from a hedge knight, he was not a man to fear.

<div class="line_en">"So. Blood for his pride, a chair for his ambition. Gold and land, that goes without saying. A sweet offer… yet sweets can be poisoned. If I were the prince, something more would I require before I should reach for this honeycomb. Some token of good faith, some sure safeguard against betrayal." Varys smiled his slimiest smile. "Which one will you give him, I wonder?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“所以了，用血债血还安抚他的自尊，拿重臣职位满足他的野心，不用说，还要加上金银和封地。这提议的确诱人…然而再怎么诱人的甜点，都是可以下毒的。如果我是亲王，在伸手拿这块蜂窝之前，还会有个要求，那，就是用来表示诚意的信物，确保不遭背叛的信物。”瓦里斯露出狡黠无比的微笑，“我很好奇，您到底把哪位送给了他？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"What avails statecraft against the love of a mother for the sweet fruit of her womb? Perhaps, for the glory of her House and the safety of the realm, the queen might be persuaded to send away Tommen or Myrcella. But both of them? Surely not."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“国家大事哪比得上母子亲情呢？或许，看在家族荣耀和王国和平的份上，太后会勉强同意把托曼与弥赛拉其中之一送走，但两个都要？绝无可能。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“这个嘛，”他说，“我自然把告密者当死对头啰。”看着瓦里斯咯咯傻笑，他心里清楚：第三个也成了。">查看中文翻译</div>
