<div class="line_en">It's the emptiness of it that fascinates me, said Franz.

<div class="line_en">The chairs and stalls seem to have been placed there without the slightest concern for the shape of the walls or position of the columns, as if wishing to express their indifference to or disdain for Gothic architecture.

The same words kept coming back, like a wanderer who cannot tear his eyes away from the countryside or like a man who cannot take leave of life.

She stopped at a tiny remote village she had never seen before, leaned the motorcycle against the church, and went in. A mass happened to be in progress. Religion was persecuted by the regime, and most people gave the church a wide berth. The only people in the pews were old men and old women, because they did not fear the regime. They feared only death.</div>

<div class="line_en">What she had unexpectedly met there in the village church was not God; it was beauty. She knew perfectly well that neither the church nor the litany was beautiful in and of itself, but they were beautiful compared to the construction site, where she spent her days amid the racket of the songs. The mass was beautiful because it appeared to her in a sudden, mysterious revelation as a world betrayed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在这座教堂里，她无意中遇到的，不是上帝，却是美。与此同时，她很清楚，教堂和连祷文本身并不美，而是与她所忍受的终日歌声喧嚣的青年工地一比，就显出美来。这场弥撒如此突兀又隐秘地出现在她眼前，美得如同一个被背弃的世界。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was neither Protestantism nor asceticism that made him so enthusiastic; it was something else, something highly personal, something he did not dare discuss with Sabina. He thought he heard a voice telling him to seize Hercules' broom and sweep all of Marie-Claude's previews, all of Marie-Anne's singers, all lectures and symposia, all useless speeches and vain words -- sweep them out of his life. The great empty space of Amsterdam's Old Church had appeared to him in a sudden and mysterious revelation as the image of his own liberation.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="这类赞美令弗兰茨开心。他从床上起来，抓住一把沉甸甸的栎木椅的椅腿，贴地将它慢慢往上举。他边举边对萨比娜说：“你什么都不用怕，我能在任何情况下保护你，我以前还得过柔道冠军呢！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But deep down she said to herself, Franz may be strong, but his strength is directed outward; when it comes to the people he lives with, the people he loves, he's weak. Franz's weakness is called goodness. Franz would never give Sabina orders. He would never command her, as Tomas had, to lay the mirror on the floor and walk back and forth on it naked. Not that he lacks sensuality; he simply lacks the strength to give orders. There are things that can be accomplished only by violence. Physical love is unthinkable without violence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，在内心深处，她又对自己说：弗兰茨是很强壮，但他的力量仅仅是对外的。面对与他共同生活的人，跟他所爱的人在一起，他却很软弱。弗兰茨的软弱叫善良。弗兰茨从不向萨比娜发号施令。他绝不会像托马斯以前那样，命令她将镜子平放在地，然后赤身裸体在上面爬来爬去。并不是他不好色，而是他没有支配力。有些事得靠暴力才能办成。比如，没有暴力，性爱是不可想象的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Franz couldn't quite remember where. But it captivated him. What does it mean to live in truth? Putting it negatively is easy enough: it means not lying, not hiding, and not dissimulating. From the time he met Sabina, however, Franz had been living in lies. He told his wife about nonexistent congresses in Amsterdam and lectures in Madrid; he was afraid to walk with Sabina through the streets of Geneva. And he enjoyed the lying and hiding: it was all so new to him. He was as excited as a teacher's pet who has plucked up the courage to play truant.</div>

<div class="line_en">Franz, on the other hand, was certain that the division of life into private and public spheres is the source of all lies: a person is one thing in private and something quite different in public. For Franz, living in truth meant breaking down the barriers between the private and the public. He was fond of quoting Andre Breton on the desirability of living in a glass house into which everyone can look and there are no secrets.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="至于弗兰茨，他肯定地认为，一切谎言的根源来自于私人生活领域与社会生活的分界：私底下是一个人，公众场合又是另一个人。依弗兰茨看来，“活在真实里”便要消除私人生活和公众之间的阻隔。他常引述安德烈·布勒东的话说他情愿生活在一间“玻璃房”里，没有任何秘密，对所有的目光敞开。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For Sabina, living in truth, lying neither to ourselves nor to others, was possible only away from the public: the moment someone keeps an eye on what we do, allowances for that eye, and nothing we do is truthful. Having a public, keeping a public in mind, means living in lies. Sabina despised literature in which people give away all kinds of intimate secrets about themselves and their friends. A man who loses his privacy loses everything, Sabina thought. And a man who gives it up of his own free will is a monster. That was why Sabina did not suffer in the least from having to keep her love secret. On the contrary, only by doing so could she live in truth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对于萨比娜而言，要活在真实中，不欺骗自己也不欺骗别人，除非与世隔绝。一旦有旁人见证我们的行为，不管我们乐意不乐意，都得适应旁观我们的目光，我们所做的一切便无一是真了。有公众在场，考虑公众，就是活在谎言中。萨比娜瞧不起那些披露个人全部私密，乃至朋友私密的文学作品。萨比娜认为，失去私密的人失去了一切，而心甘情愿放弃私密的人则是怪物。所以萨比娜并不因需要隐藏自己的爱情而感到痛苦。相反，这正是她能活在“真实”里的惟一方式。">查看中文翻译</div>
