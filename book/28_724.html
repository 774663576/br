<div class="line_en">Barack, as he always is on high-pressure days, was more easygoing than ever. He greeted the poll workers, picked up his ballot, and shook hands with anyone he encountered, appearing relaxed. It made sense, I guess. This whole endeavor was about to be out of his hands.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="之前，贝拉克每天都是在高压下度过的，因此那天他显得格外自在。他跟投票点的工作人员打了招呼，拿了一张选票，并跟每一个遇到的人握手，看上去非常轻松。我觉得这很正常。他能做的已经都做了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Four months later, on November 4, 2008, I cast my vote for Barack. The two of us went early that morning to our polling place, which was in the gym at Beulah Shoesmith Elementary School, just a few blocks away from our house in Chicago. We brought Sasha and Malia along, both of them dressed and ready for school. Even on Election Day -- maybe especially on Election Day -- I thought school would be a good idea. School was routine. School was comfort. As we walked past banks of photographers and TV cameras to get into the gym, as people around us talked about the historic nature of everything, I was happy to have the lunch boxes packed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="四个月后，2008年11月4日，我将我的选票投给了贝拉克。那天我们早早到达了我们所属的投票点，它设在比尤拉·休史密斯小学的体育馆内，离我们在芝加哥的住所只有几个街区。萨沙和玛利亚随我们一起出发，她们俩都穿戴整齐准备去上学。即使在大选当天—或许正是因为在大选当天—我还是要送她们去上学。上学是日常生活的一部分，能让大家安心。当我们经过无数的摄影师和摄像机进入体育馆，听到周围的人谈论着这件事情的历史意义时，我只是庆幸自己给孩子们带好了午饭。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">That day, I stared for a few extra seconds at the little oblong bubble next to my husband's name for president of the United States. After almost twenty-one months of campaigning, attacks, and exhaustion, this was it -- the last thing I needed to do.</div>

<div class="line_en">I'd voted for Barack many times before, in primaries and general elections, in state-level and national races, and this trip to the polls felt no different. Voting, for me, was a habit, a healthy ritual to be done conscientiously and at every opportunity. My parents had taken me to the polls as a kid, and I'd made a practice of bringing Sasha and Malia with me anytime I could, hoping to reinforce both the ease and the importance of the act.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我给贝拉克投过无数次票，从预选到普选，从各州竞选到全国竞选，而这一次也没有什么不同。投票对我而言是一项积极的惯例，需要我认真对待，抓住每一次机会。从小父母就会带我去投票，如今每次需要我投票时，我也会带上萨沙和玛利亚，希望她们习惯这件事，并且明白它的重要性。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">My husband's career had allowed me to witness the machinations of politics and power up close. I'd seen how just a handful of votes in every precinct could mean the difference not just between one candidate and another but between one value system and the next. If a few people stayed home in each neighborhood, it could determine what our kids learned in schools, which health-care options we had available, or whether or not we sent our troops to war. Voting was both simple and incredibly effective.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我丈夫的职业让我得以亲眼见证政治与权力的微妙。我目睹了仅仅因为每个选区的个别选票之差，两名候选人乃至两种价值体系的结局就会大相径庭。如果每个街区都有少数人待在家里不去投票，这将直接影响到我们的孩子在学校里学习什么内容，我们将享受哪种医保方案，或者我们是否需要派兵打仗。投票既非难事，影响又极为深远。">查看中文翻译</div>

You've leaped but you haven't landed. You can't know yet how the future's going to feel. After months of everything going too fast, time slows to an agonizing crawl.

<div class="line_en">If you believed the polls, it appeared that Barack was poised to win, but I also knew he'd been working on two possible speeches for the night ahead -- one for a victory, another for a concession. By now we understood enough about politics and polling to take nothing for granted. We knew of the phenomenon called the Bradley effect, named for an African American candidate, Tom Bradley, who'd run for governor in California in the early 1980s. While the polls had consistently shown Bradley leading, he'd lost on Election Day, surprising everyone and supplying the world with a bigger lesson about bigotry, as the pattern repeated itself for years to come in different high-profile races involving black candidates around the country. The theory was that when it came to minority candidates, voters often hid their prejudice from pollsters, expressing it only from the privacy of the voting booth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果只看民意测验，贝拉克明显胜券在握。但我知道他为那晚准备了两篇讲稿—一篇是获选宣言，另一篇则是落选致辞。如今我们已足够了解政治和民意测验那一套，因此不会有任何的想当然。我们也知道有种现象叫“布莱德利效应”，它因汤姆·布莱德利而得名。他是一位曾在20世纪80年代初竞选加利福尼亚州州长的非洲裔美国候选人。民意测验一直显示布莱德利处于领先地位，但他在选举当天遭到惨败。这一结果震惊了所有人，也让世界更加深刻地体会到什么叫偏见。许多年来，在各式各样有黑人候选人参与的备受瞩目的竞选竞争中，这样的例子不胜枚举。结果证明，面对少数族裔候选人，选民往往会在民意测验时藏起自己的偏见，直到独自站在投票厅里才会表现出来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Throughout the campaign, I'd asked myself over and over whether America was really ready to elect a black president, whether the country was in a strong enough place to see beyond race and move past prejudice. Finally, we were about to find out.</div>

<div class="line_en">Barack was the right person for this moment in history, for a job that was never going to be easy but that had grown, thanks to the financial crisis, exponentially more difficult. I'd been trumpeting it for more than a year and a half now, all over America: My husband was calm and prepared. Complexity didn't scare him. He had a brain capable of sorting through every intricacy. I was biased, of course, and personally I still would've been content to lose the election and reclaim some version of our old lives, but I also was feeling that as a country we truly needed his help. It was time to stop thinking about something as arbitrary as skin color. We'd be foolish at this point not to put him in office. Still, he would inherit a mess.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="贝拉克是此刻历史上最合适的人选。总统的位子向来不好坐，而且越来越难坐。因为金融危机，所有这些困难都被放大了数倍。这一年半以来，我一直在告诉全美人民：我的丈夫沉着冷静、虑事周全。他不会被一团乱麻吓倒，他能够将复杂的事情梳理清楚。我当然希望我们获胜。即使输了选举，过回以前的生活也能让我心满意足，但我仍然觉得这个国家需要他的帮助。此刻我们需要停止凭借肤色随意地评价他人。此刻不推他上台将是我们的失策，虽然摆在他面前的是一个巨大的烂摊子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As a whole, the general election had been less grueling than the pitched battle of the primaries. John McCain had done himself no favors by choosing Alaska's governor, Sarah Palin, as his running mate. Inexperienced and unprepared, she'd quickly become a national punch line. And then, in mid-September, the news had turned disastrous. The U. S. economy began to spiral out of control when Lehman Brothers, one of the country's largest investment banks, abruptly went belly-up. The titans of Wall Street, the world now realized, had spent years racking up profits on the backs of junk home loans. Stocks plummeted. Credit markets froze. Retirement funds vanished.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="整体来看，普选远比不上预选时那么艰难和激烈。约翰·麦凯恩选择了阿拉斯加州州长萨拉·佩林做竞选伙伴，为此他吃尽了苦头。由于缺乏经验和准备，佩林很快成为美国人民的笑柄。到了9月，局势变得异常糟糕。美国最大投资银行之一的雷曼兄弟公司突然宣告破产，由此美国经济开始急剧失控。世界这才发现，华尔街巨头们数年来都在利用高风险住房债券疯狂敛财。股票暴跌，信贷市场冻结，退休基金消失。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Nope." He smiled up at me, as if trying to prove it was true. Only a day earlier, we'd received news that Toot, Barack's eighty-six-year-old grandmother, had passed away in Hawaii after being sick for months with cancer. Knowing he'd missed saying good-bye to his mother, Barack had made a point of seeing Toot. We'd taken the kids to visit her late that summer, and he'd gone again on his own ten days earlier, stepping off the campaign trail for a day to sit and hold her hand. It occurred to me what a sad thing this was. Barack had lost his mother at the very genesis of his political career, two months after announcing his run for state senate. Now, as he reached its apex, his grandmother wouldn't be around to witness it. The people who'd raised him were gone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不。”他冲我微笑，似乎想证明自己不累。前一天我们刚刚得知，贝拉克八十六岁的外祖母图特在经历了几个月癌症的折磨后，已于夏威夷过世。贝拉克曾错过了见自己母亲的最后一面，因此他时刻惦记着去探望图特。那年夏末我们带着孩子去看她；十天前，他又从竞选日程中抽出一天时间独自前去陪她，握着她的手。想起这件事我就满怀悲伤。贝拉克刚刚踏入政界时，仅在宣布竞选参议员后的两个月，他的母亲就过世了。如今他走到了政治生涯的巅峰，他的外祖母又无缘见证。养育他的人都离开了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The first results came in around 6:00 p. m. central time, with Kentucky going for McCain and Vermont for Barack. Then West Virginia went for McCain, and after that so did South Carolina. My confidence lurched a little, though none of this was a surprise. According to Axe and Plouffe, who were buzzing in and out of the room, announcing what felt like every sliver of information they received, everything was unfolding as predicted. Though the updates were generally positive, the political chatter was the last thing I wanted to hear. We had no control over anything anyway, so what was the point? We'd leaped and now, one way or another, we'd land. We could see on TV that thousands of people were already amassing at Grant Park, a mile or so away on the lakefront, where election coverage was being broadcast on Jumbotron screens and where Barack would later show up to deliver one of his two speeches. There were police officers stationed on practically every corner, Coast Guard boats patrolling the lake, helicopters overhead. All of Chicago, it seemed, was holding its breath, waiting for news.</div>

Things felt slow and aqueous and slightly distorted, even if we were moving quickly and with precise guidance, waved by Secret Service agents into a freight elevator, hustled out a back exit at the hotel and into a waiting SUV. Did I breathe the air as we stepped outside? Did I thank the person who held open the door as we passed by? Was I smiling? I don't know. It was as if I were still trying to frog-kick my way back to reality. Some of this, I assumed, had to be fatigue. It had been, as predicted, a very long day.

<div class="line_en">Barack and I looked at each other and started to laugh. It was then that we realized that ours were the only cars on the street. Barack was now president-elect. The Secret Service had cleared everything out, shutting down an entire section of Lake Shore Drive, blocking every intersection along the route -- a standard precaution for a president, we'd soon learn. But for us, it was new.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="贝拉克和我对视了一眼，然后笑了起来。我们这才发现，整条路上只有我们这一辆车。贝拉克如今是总统当选人了，特勤局清除了一切障碍，控制了整条湖滨大道，封锁了所有岔路口—之后我们会发现，这是总统特有的标准的预防机制，但对当时的我们来说这很新鲜。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I remember little of Barack's speech that night. Sasha, Malia, and I watched him from the wings as he said his words, surrounded by those glass shields and by our city and by the comfort of more than sixty-nine million votes. What stays with me is that sense of comfort, the unusual calmness of that unusually warm November night by the lake in Chicago. After so many months of going to high-energy campaign rallies with crowds deliberately whipped up into a shouting, chanting frenzy, the atmosphere in Grant Park was different. We were standing before a giant, jubilant mass of Americans who were also palpably reflective. What I heard was relative silence. It seemed almost as if I could make out every face in the crowd. There were tears in many eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我不太记得当晚贝拉克演讲的内容。萨沙、玛利亚和我站在侧台上看着他演讲，周身环绕着那些防弹护罩、我们的城市，还有六千九百多万张选票带来的安慰。当时陪伴着我的就是这种安慰感； 11月的芝加哥湖畔，那个格外温暖的夜里有一种异样的宁静。数月以来，伴随着高强度的竞选集会，我们见识过太多人们自发呐喊和嘶吼的狂潮，但格兰特公园却是另一种氛围。我们面对着一群数目巨大、欢呼庆祝的美国民众，但每个人又都显而易见地心怀忐忑。我感受到一种别样的宁静。我感觉似乎能辨别出人群中的每一张面庞。许多人眼里都含着热泪。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And they were. More than 200,000 people had crammed into the park to see us. We could hear an expectant hum as we exited the vehicle and were ushered into a set of white tents that had been put up at the front of the park, forming a tunnel that led to the stage. A group of friends and family had gathered there to greet us, only now, due to Secret Service protocol, they were cordoned off behind a rope. Barack put his arm around me, almost as if to make sure I was still there.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们确实在那里。二十多万群众聚集在公园里等着见我们。下车时我们能听到人群中期待的议论声，随后我们被带到公园门前，由许多白色的帐篷搭起的一条通道上，一直通往广场台前。一些朋友和家人也在那里等着向我们表示祝贺，但因为特工安保制度要求，他们只能站在隔离带后。贝拉克一只手环抱着我，像是要确认我是否还在他身边。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We walked out onto the stage a few minutes later, the four of us, me holding Malia's hand and Barack holding Sasha's. I saw a lot of things at once. I saw that a wall of thick, bulletproof glass had been erected around the stage. I saw an ocean of people, many of them waving little American flags. My brain could process none of it. It all felt too big.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="几分钟后，我们一家四口走上台，我牵着玛利亚的手，贝拉克牵着萨沙的手。一瞬间，我看到了许许多多的画面。我看到舞台四周竖起了一排厚厚的防弹玻璃护罩。我看到台下人山人海，许多人手里挥舞着小国旗。我的大脑停止了转动。这太盛大了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I put an arm around Malia. "The people are already there, sweetie," I said. "Don't worry, they're waiting for us."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我一手揽过玛利亚。“大家已经在那里了，亲爱的，”我说道。“别担心，他们在等着我们呢。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Maybe the calmness was something I imagined, or maybe for all of us, it was just a product of the late hour. It was almost midnight, after all. And everyone had been waiting. We'd been waiting a long, long time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="或许这种宁静是我幻想出来的，又或许对我们所有人来说，这只不过是因为时间太晚了。毕竟当时已接近午夜。之前，所有人都在苦苦等待，我们已经等了太久、太久。">查看中文翻译</div>
