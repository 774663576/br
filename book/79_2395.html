<div class="line_en">A week and a half later two feet of snow lay white and crisp and even on the grounds of the Overlook Hotel. The hedge menagerie was buried up to its haunches; the rabbit, frozen on its hind legs, seemed to be rising from a white pool. Some of the drifts were over five feet deep. The wind was constantly changing them, sculpting them into sinuous, dunelike shapes. Twice Jack had snowshoed clumsily around to the equipment shed for his shovel to clear the porch, the third time he shrugged, simply cleared a path through the towering drift lying against the door, and let Danny amuse himself by sledding to the right and left of the path. The truly heroic drifts lay against the Overlook's west side; some of them towered to a height of twenty feet, and beyond them the ground was scoured bare to the grass by the constant windflow. The first-floor windows were covered, and the view from the dining room which Jack had so admired on closing day was now no more exciting than a view of a blank movie screen. Their phone had been out for the last eight days, and the CB radio in Ullman's office was now their only communications link with the outside world.</div>

<div class="line_en">It snowed every day now, sometimes only brief flurries that powdered the glittering snow crust, sometimes for real, the low whistle of the wind cranking up to a womanish shriek that made the old hotel rock and groan alarmingly even in its deep cradle of snow. Night temperatures had not gotten above 10°, and although the thermometer by the kitchen service entrance sometimes got as high as 25° in the early afternoons, the steady knife edge of the wind made it uncomfortable to go out without a ski mask. But they all did go out on the days when the sun shone, usually wearing two sets of clothing and mittens on over their gloves. Getting out was almost a compulsive thing; the hotel was circled with the double track of Danny's Flexible Flyer. The permutations were nearly endless: Danny riding while his parents pulled; Daddy riding and laughing while Wendy and Danny tried to pull (it was just possible for them to pull him on the icy crust, and flatly impossible when powder covered it); Danny and Mommy riding; Wendy riding by herself while her menfolk pulled and puffed white vapor like drayhorses, pretending she was heavier than she was. They laughed a great deal on these sled excursions around the house, but the whooping and impersonal voice of the wind, so huge and hollowly sincere, made their laughter seem tinny and forced.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在没有哪天不下雪，有时只是下一会儿小雪，给银光闪闪的雪面再添一层白粉；有时动真格的，狂风低吼着，听上去像女人凄厉的尖叫声。这家老饭店卧在深深的积雪中，摇晃着，呻吟着，令人惊惶不已。夜间的气温不超过华氏10度，虽然厨房后门门口边的温度计有时在下午早些时候显示的温度达华氏25度，但是，如果不戴滑雪面罩就出门，从不歇息的寒风仍然会刮得人刀割般地难受。尽管如此，他们每逢晴好的日子还是要到户外去，穿上两套冬衣、单层手套外面加上连指手套。户外活动让人难以舍弃，饭店外环绕着“飞橇”牌雪橇滑出的痕迹。组合几乎是无穷无尽的：丹尼坐，父母拉；爸爸坐，温迪和丹尼费劲地拉（在冰面上他们能拉动，冰面盖上雪粉后他们就拉不动了），爸爸大笑；丹尼和妈妈坐；温迪一个人乘坐，而她的两位男子汉像马一样拉着雪橇，呼着白汽，装出拉不动的样子。他们绕饭店进行的雪橇旅行总是伴随着欢声笑语，但他们的笑声在强大而又无情的风声中显得那样苍白、勉强。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They had seen caribou tracks in the snow and once the caribou themselves, a group of five standing motionlessly below the security fence. They had all taken turns with Jack's Zeiss-Ikon binoculars to see them better, and looking at them had given Wendy a weird, unreal feeling: they were standing leg-deep in the snow that covered the highway, and it came to her that between now and the spring thaw, the road belonged more to the caribou than it did to them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们在雪地上发现了驯鹿的足迹，有一次还看见了驯鹿，一共五头，它们一动不动地站在安全栅外面。他们轮流用杰克的双筒望远镜观看，看得非常清楚。看着它们，温迪心里产生了一种怪异的、似是而非的感觉：驯鹿们站在公路上齐腰深的积雪中，她忽然想，从现在起到来年春天冰雪融化为止，公路很大程度上属于驯鹿而不是他们。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now the things that men had made up here were neutralized. The caribou understood that, she believed. She had put the binoculars down and had said something about starting lunch and in the kitchen she had cried a little, trying to rid herself of the awful pent-up feeling that sometimes fell on her like a large, pressing hand over her heart. She thought of the caribou. She thought of the wasps Jack had put out on the service entrance platform, under the Pyrex bowl, to freeze.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在，人类在这里留下的一切都已经弱化了，她相信驯鹿知道这一点。当时，她放下望远镜，说了句什么吃午饭之类的话。在厨房里她忍不住哭了，极力想摆脱时不时向她袭来的像只压在她胸口上的巨手的郁闷感觉。她想到了驯鹿，想到了冻死在玻璃碗里的大黄蜂。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There were plenty of snowshoes hung from nails in the equipment shed, and Jack found a pair to fit each of them, although Danny's pair was quite a bit outsized. Jack did well with them. Although he had not snowshoed since his boyhood in Berlin, New Hampshire, he retaught himself quickly. Wendy didn't care much for it -- even fifteen minutes of tramping around on the outsized laced paddles made her legs and ankles ache outrageously -- but Danny was intrigued and working hard to pick up the knack. He still fell often, but lack was pleased with his progress. He said that by February Danny would be skipping circles around both of them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="工具栅里有许多雪鞋，挂在钉子上。杰克为他们每人挑了一双合适的，不过丹尼的那双还是有点大。杰克穿这种鞋很在行，虽然小时候住在新罕布什尔州珀林市起他就没有穿过雪鞋了，但他很快重新掌握了这种技巧。温迪不喜欢在雪地上行走——绑上那双有些大的板子在雪地里走上一刻钟，她的腿和脚踝就疼得受不了了——但丹尼却入了迷，为掌握其中的窍门他练得十分卖力。虽然他摔倒，但杰克对他的长进很满意，他说，不出明年二月份，丹尼就可以绕两只鞋板转圈了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This day was overcast, and by noon the sky had already begun to spit snow. The radio was promising another eight to twelve inches and chanting hosannas to Precipitation, that great god of Colorado skiers. Wendy, sitting in the bedroom and knitting a scarf, thought to herself that she knew exactly what the skiers could do with all that snow. She knew exactly where they could put it.</div>

<div class="line_en">Jack was in the cellar. He had gone down to check the furnace and boiler -- such checks had become a ritual with him since the snow had closed them in -- and after satisfying himself that everything was going well he had wandered through the arch, screwed the lightbulb on, and had seated himself in an old and cobwebby camp chair he had found. He was leafing through the old records and papers, constantly wiping his mouth with his handkerchief as he did so. Confinement had leached his skin of its autumn tan, and as he sat hunched over the yellowed, crackling sheets, his reddish-blond hair tumbling untidily over his forehead, he looked slightly lunatic. He had found some odd things tucked in among the invoices, bills of lading, receipts. Disquieting things. A bloody strip of sheeting. A dismembered teddy bear that seemed to have been slashed to pieces. A crumpled sheet of violet ladies' stationery, a ghost of perfume still clinging to it beneath the musk of age, a note begun and left unfinished in faded blue ink: "Dearest Tommy, I can't think so well up here as I'd hoped, about us I mean, of course, who else? Ha. Ha. Things keep getting in the way. I've had strange dreams about things going bump in the night, can you believe that and" That was all. The note was dated June 27, 1934. He found a hand puppet that seemed to be either a witch or a warlock… something with long teeth and a pointy hat, at any rate. It had been improbably tucked between a bundle of natural-gas receipts and a bundle of receipts for Vichy water. And something that seemed to be a poem, scribbled on the back of a menu in dark pencil:</div>

<div class="line_en">Yes, that's where it was, whatever it was. In there. In the bathroom. His double walked forward, as if to escape the glass. It put its hand out, pressed it against his own. Then it fell away at an angle as the bathroom door swung open. He looked in.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="是的，那个东西就在这里，不管它是什么。就在那里面，在浴室里面。他的影子向前走来，仿佛要走出镜子。它伸出手，按在镜子里的手上。浴室门开了，他往里面看去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He stepped further in. Nothing here, nothing at all. Only an empty room, cold because Daddy was heating the east wing today. A bureau. A closet, its door open to reveal a clutch of hotel hangers, the kind you can't steal. A Gideon Bible on an endtable. To his left was the bathroom door, a full-length mirror on it reflecting his own white-faced image. That door was ajar and -- He watched his double nod slowly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他又往里面走了几步。什么都没有，根本就没什么。只有一间寒气逼人的空屋子，因为爸爸今天在给东侧供暖。一台柜子，一个壁橱，壁橱门敞着，露出了里面的一捆衣架。茶几上放着一本《圣经》。左边的门通向浴室，门上的大镜子映出他面色苍白的身影。浴室门虚掩着，而且——他端详着自己的影子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A long room, old-fashioned, like a Pullman car. Tiny white hexagonal tiles on the floor. At the far end, a toilet with the lid up. At the right, a washbasin and another mirror above it, the kind that hides a medicine cabinet. To the left, a huge white tub on claw feet, the shower curtain pulled closed. Danny stepped into the bathroom and walked toward the tub dreamily, as if propelled from outside himself, as if this whole thing were one of the dreams Tony had brought him, that he would perhaps see something nice when he pulled the shower curtain back, something Daddy had forgotten or Mommy had lost, something that would make them both happy -- So he pulled the shower curtain back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="房间很长，布置得很古旧，像一辆普尔曼轿车。地板铺着六边形的白色小瓷砖；房间远的那一端是一座揭开盖子的抽水马桶；右边是洗脸池，池子上方有一面镜子，镜子的背后有一个药橱；左边是一个支在爪形足上的白色大浴缸，淋浴帘拉上了。丹尼走进浴室，如醉如痴地向浴缸走去，好像受到了某种外力的驱使，这一切都仿佛是托尼给他带来的一个梦，好像他拉开帘子便会发现什么好东西似的——爸爸忘记了的或妈妈丢失了的东西，找到了他们一定会很高兴。于是，他拉开了淋浴帘子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The woman in the tub had been dead for a long time. She was bloated and purple, her gas-filled belly rising out of the cold, ice-rimmed water like some fleshy island. Her eyes were fixed on Danny's, glassy and huge, like marbles. She was grinning, her purple lips pulled back in a grimace. Her breasts lolled. Her pubic hair floated. Her hands were frozen on the knurled porcelain sides of the tub like crab claws.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="浴缸里的女人很久以前就死了。她浑身青紫、肿胀，充满气体的肚皮凸出水面，像一座周围结上了冰的小岛。她直楞楞地瞪着丹尼，眼睛大而透明，像玻璃球一样。她狞笑着，乌紫的嘴唇向两边咧开，丑陋不堪。她的乳房吊在胸前，阴毛漂浮在水中，双手僵直，像蟹爪一样抓在浴缸两侧。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Danny shrieked. But the sound never escaped his lips; turning inward and inward, it fell down in his darkness like a stone in a well. He took a single blundering step backward, bearing his heels clack on the white hexagonal tiles, and at the same moment his urine broke, spilling effortlessly out of him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="丹尼惊叫起来，但叫声没有从他口中溢出，却回头跌进了他体内的黑暗深处，犹如一块石头坠入了枯井中。他踉踉跄跄地后退了一步，听见自己的脚后跟啪嗒一声磕在了地板砖上，也就在这时，他的尿无拘无束地流了出来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Still grinning, her huge marble eyes fixed on him, she was sitting up. Her dead palms made squittering noises on the porcelain. Her breasts swayed like ancient cracked punching bags. There was the minute sound of breaking ice shards. She was not breathing. She was a corpse, and dead long years.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她狞笑着，用玻璃球一样的眼睛逼视着丹尼。她坐起来了，僵死的手掌碰得浴缸的陶瓷边缘咔咔直响，乳房像一对裂了缝的旧沙袋一样晃荡着。薄冰破碎时发出了细碎的哗啦声。她没有呼吸，她是一具僵尸。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Danny turned and ran. Bolting through the bathroom door, his eyes starting from their sockets, his hair on end like the hair of a hedgehog about to be turned into a sacrificial (croquet? or rogue?) ball, his mouth open and soundless. He ran full-tilt into the outside door of 217, which was now closed. He began hammering on it, far beyond realizing that it was unlocked, and he had only to turn the knob to let himself out. His mouth pealed forth deafening screams that were beyond human auditory range. He could only hammer on the door and hear the dead woman coming for him, bloated belly, dry hair, outstretched hands-something that had lain slain in that tub for perhaps years, embalmed there in magic.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="丹尼转身逃跑起来。他冲出浴室门，眼球直往外突，头发像刺猬毛一样竖起来了，嘴巴张得大大的，但没发出任何声音。他整个身子向前倾斜，奋力扑向217房间最外面的那道门，可是，门是关着的。他用拳头死命地砸门，丝毫没意识到锁是开着的，他只需旋一旋把手就可以出去。他发出的尖叫震耳欲聋，超出了人的听觉范围。他一个劲地捶着门，听到女尸一步步逼了过来——肚皮肿胀，头发干枯，双手伸开——神奇地在浴缸里保存了多年的一具死尸。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And then the voice of Dick Hallorann came to him, so sudden and unexpected, so calm, that his locked vocal cords opened and he began to cry weakly -- not with fear but with blessed relief.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时，他听见了迪克·哈洛伦的声音。这平静的声音来得既突然又出人意外，他绷紧的声带松驰下来，嘤嘤地哭了——不是由于害怕，而是由于情绪的舒缓。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">His eyelids snapped down. His hands curled into balls. His shoulders hunched with the effort of his concentration: (Nothing there nothing there not there at all NOTHING THERE THERE IS NOTHING!)</div>

And he was just beginning to relax, just beginning to realize that the door must be unlocked and he could go, when the years-damp, bloated, fish-smelling hands closed softly around his throat and he was turned implacably around to stare into that dead and purple face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="时间一秒秒过去了。他逐渐放松下来，意识到只有打开门才能出去，这时，那双滑腻肿胀的、散发着腥臭的手软乎乎地卡住了他的脖子。不容分说，他被扭了过去，直接面对那张乌黑发紫的死脸。">查看中文翻译</div>
