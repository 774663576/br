<div class="line_en">Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again. It seemed to me I stood by the iron gate leading to the drive, and for a while I could not enter, for the way was barred to me. There was a padlock and? chain upon the gate. I called in my dream to the lodge-keeper, and had no answer, and peering closer through the rusted spokes of the gate I saw that the lodge was uninhabited.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="昨晚，我梦见自己又回到了曼陀丽庄园。恍惚中，我站在那扇通往车道的大铁门前，好一会儿被挡在门外进不去。铁门上挂着把大锁，还系了根铁链。我在梦里大声叫唤看门人，却没人答应。于是我就凑近身子，隔着门上生锈的铁条朝里张望，这才明白曼陀丽已是座阒寂无人的空宅。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">No smoke came from the chimney, and the little lattice windows gaped forlorn. Then, like all dreamers, I was possessed of a sudden with supernatural powers and passed like a spirit through the barrier before me. The drive wound away in front of me, twisting and turning as it had always done, but as I advanced I was aware that a change had come upon it; it was narrow and unkempt, not the drive that we had known. At first I was puzzled and did not understand, and it was only when I bent my head to avoid the low swinging branch of a tree that I realized what had happened. Nature had come into her own again and, little by little, in her stealthy, insidious way had encroached upon the drive with long, tenacious fingers. The woods, always a menace even in the past, had triumphed in the end. They crowded, dark and uncontrolled, to the borders of the drive. The beeches with white, naked limbs leant close to one another, their branches intermingled in a strange embrace, making a vault above my head like the archway of a church. And there were other trees as well, trees that I did not recognize, squat oaks and tortured elms that straggled cheek by jowl with the beeches, and had thrust themselves out of the quiet earth, along with monster shrubs and plants, none of which I remembered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="烟囱不再飘起袅袅青烟。一扇扇小花格窗凄凉地洞开着。这时，我突然像所有的梦中人一样，不知从哪儿获得了超自然的神力，幽灵般飘过面前的障碍物。车道在我眼前伸展开去，婉蜒曲折，依稀如旧。但是待我向前走去，就觉察到车道已起了变化：它显得又狭窄又荒僻，不再是我们熟悉的那个模样。我一时感到迷惑不解，但当我低下头去避开一根低垂摇曳的树枝时，才发现了变化的来由。原来自然界已恢复了本来的面目，渐渐把她细长的手指顽强而偷偷摸摸地伸到车道上来了。即使在过去，树林对车道来说，也始终是个威胁，如今则终于赢得胜利，黑压压势不可挡地向着车道两侧边沿逼近。榉树伸开赤裸的白色肢体，互相紧紧偎依，枝条交叉错杂，形成奇特的拥抱，在我头顶构成一个形似教堂拱道的穹隆。这里还长有许多别的树木，有些我叫不出名字，还有些低矮的橡树和翘曲的榆树，都同榉树盘根错节地纠结在一起。橡树、榆树，还有巨怪似的灌木丛以及其他一些草木，就这么纷列在这块静谧的土地上，全然不是我记忆中的景象。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The drive was a ribbon now, a thread of its former self, with gravel surface gone, and choked with grass and moss. The trees had thrown out low branches, making an impediment to progress; the gnarled roots looked like skeleton claws. Scattered here and again amongst this jungle growth I would recognize shrubs that had been landmarks in our time, things of culture and grace, hydrangeas whose blue heads had been famous. No hand had checked their progress, and they had gone native now, rearing to monster height without a bloom, black and ugly as the nameless parasites that grew beside them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="车道已变成一条细带，与过去比，简直成了一根线！路面的沙砾层已不知去向，只见密密的一片杂草和青苔。树枝倒垂下来，阻挡着我的去路，节瘤毕露的根部活像骷髅的魔爪。在这片荒凉芜秽的林莽中间，时而也还能认出一些灌木丛，那是当年我们居住时的标志，是人工栽培和雅趣的产物。如紫阳，它的花穗曾经颇负盛名，但如今因为无人修剪照拂，也成了野生植物，枝干高得出奇，却开不出一朵花来，又黑又丑，与左近那些无名的草木没有什么两样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On and on, now east now west, wound the poor thread that once had been our drive. Sometimes I thought it lost, but it appeared again, beneath a fallen tree perhaps, or struggling on the other side of a muddied ditch created by the winter rains. I had not thought the way so long. Surely the miles had multiplied, even as the trees had done, and this path led but to a labyrinth, some choked wilderness, and not to the house at all. I came upon it suddenly; the approach masked by the unnatural growth of a vast shrub that spread in all directions, and I stood, my heart thumping in my breast, the strange prick of tears behind my eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="忽而东，忽而西，这条可怜的细线歪歪扭扭地向前伸展。（而它一度就是我们的车道啊！）有时我以为它到头了，不料它又从一棵倒在地上的死树底下钻出，或是在一道由冬日绵雨积成的泥泞小沟的那头挣扎着露出头来。我从未觉得道儿竟这么长，那距离想必是不断成倍延伸，就像树木成倍往高处长去一样。车道似乎根本不通向宅子，而是引入一片迷津，通向一片混饨杂乱的荒野。突然间，我一眼看到了那宅子，宅前的通道被一大簇乱生乱长的异样灌木覆盖了。我仁立着，心儿在胸中怦怦剧跳；眼眶里泪花滚动，带来一阵异样的痛楚。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was Manderley, our Manderley, secretive and silent as it had always been, the grey stone shining in the moonlight of my dream, the mullioned windows reflecting the green lawns and the terrace. Time could not wreck the perfect symmetry of those walls, nor the site itself, a jewel in the hollow of a hand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这就是曼陀丽！我们的曼陀而故居！还是和过去一样的隐僻、静谧。灰色的砖石在梦境的月光里显得白惨惨的，嵌有竖框的窗子映着绿草坪和屋前平台。时光的流逝，丝毫无损于围墙的完美对称，也无损于宅基本身，整个宅子宛如手掌心里的一颗明珠。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The terrace sloped to the lawns, and the lawns stretched to the sea, and turning I could see the sheet of silver placid under the moon, like a lake undisturbed by wind or storm. No waves would come to ruffle this dream water, and no bulk of cloud, wind-driven from the west, obscure the clarity of this pale sky.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="平台斜连草地，草地一直伸向大海。一转身，我看见那一泓银色的海水，犹如风平浪静时明镜般的湖面，静静地任月光爱抚。没有波浪会使这梦之水粼粼荡漾，也不见云块被西风吹来，遮掩这清朗惨白的夜空。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I turned again to the house, and though it stood inviolate, untouched, as though we ourselves had left but yesterday, I saw that the garden had obeyed the jungle law, even as the woods had done. The rhododendrons stood fifty feet high, twisted and entwined with bracken, and they had entered into alien marriage with a host of nameless shrubs, poor, bastard things that clung about their roots as though conscious of their spurious origin. A lilac had mated with a copper beech, and to bind them yet more closely to one another the malevolent ivy, always an enemy to grace, had thrown her tendrils about the pair and made them prisoners. Ivy held prior place in this lost garden, the long strands crept across the lawns, and soon would encroach upon the house itself. There was another plant too, some half-breed from the woods, whose seed had been scattered long ago beneath the trees and then forgotten, and now, marching in unison with the ivy, thrust its ugly form like a giant rhubarb towards the soft grass where the daffodils had blown.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我又转身面向屋子。尽管它屹然挺立，一副神圣不可侵犯的神态，仿佛我们昨天刚刚离开，谁也没敢来碰它一下，但我发现庭园也和林子一样，服从了丛林法则。石南竟高达一百五十码，它们与羊齿绞曲缠绕在一起，还和一大簇无名的灌木胡乱交配。这些杂种灌木，紧紧地依傍着石甫的根部，似乎是意识到自己出身的卑贱。一棵紫丁香与铜榉长到一块儿去了，而那永远与优雅为敌的常青藤，还恶毒地伸出弯曲的蔓须，把这对伙伴更紧地卷绕起来，使它们沦为俘虏。在这无人照管的弃园里，常青藤占着最突出的地位，一股股、一绞纹的长藤爬过草地，眼看就要侵入屋子。此外还有一种原来生长在林中的杂交植物，它的种子很久前散落在树底下，接着也就被人遗忘了，如今它却和常青藤齐头并进，像大黄草似的，把自己丑陋的身子挺向曾经盛开过水仙花的柔软的草地。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Nettles were everywhere, the vanguard of the army. They choked the terrace, they sprawled about the paths, they leant, vulgar and lanky, against the very windows of the house. They made indifferent sentinels, for in many places their ranks had been broken by the rhubarb plant, and they lay with crumpled heads and listless stems, making a pathway for the rabbits. I left the drive and went on to the terrace, for the nettles were no barrier to me, a dreamer. I walked enchanted, and nothing held me back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到处可以看到荨麻，它们可以算是入侵大军的先头部队。它们盖满平台，乱七八槽地拥塞着走道，还把它粗俗细长的身子斜靠在屋子的窗棂上。它们是些很差劲的步哨，因为在好些地方，它们的队伍被大黄草突破，就耷拉脑袋，没精打采地伸着躯于，成了野兔出没的处所。我离开车道，走向平台。荨麻拦不住我，任何东西都拦不住我，因为梦中人走路是有法术的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Moonlight can play odd tricks upon the fancy, even upon a dreamer's fancy. As I stood there, hushed and still, I could swear that the house was not an empty shell but lived and breathed as it had lived before.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="月光能给人造成奇异的幻觉，即使对梦中人也不例外。我肃然站在宅子前，竟断定它不是一个空洞的躯壳，而像过去那样是有生命的、在呼吸着的活物。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Light came from the windows, the curtains blew softly in the night air, and there, in the library, the door would stand half open as we had left it, with my handkerchief on the table beside the bowl of autumn roses.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="窗户里透出灯光，窗帷在夜风中微微拂动。藏书室里，门半开着，那是我们出去时忘了随手带上。我的手绢还留在桌子上，在一瓶秋玫瑰的旁边。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The room would bear witness to our presence. The little heap of library books marked ready to return, and the discarded copy of The Times. Ashtrays, with the stub of a cigarette; cushions, with the imprint of our heads upon them, lolling in the chairs; the charred embers of our log fire still smouldering against the morning. And Jasper, dear Jasper, with his soulful eyes and great, sagging jowl, would be stretched upon the floor, his tail a-thump when he heard his master's footsteps.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="藏书室里处处留着我们尚未离去的印记：一小堆标有“待归还”记号的图书馆藏书；随手丢在一边的《泰晤士报》；烟灰缸里的一段烟蒂；歪歪斜斜倒在椅子上的枕垫，上边还印着我俩并头倚靠的痕迹；壁炉里炭火的余烬还在晨曦中吐着缕缕青烟；而杰斯珀，爱犬杰斯珀，就躺在地板上，眼睛充满着灵性，肥大的颈部下垂着，尾巴拍搭拍搭摇个不停，那是因为它听见了主人的脚步声。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A cloud, hitherto unseen, came upon the moon, and hovered an instant like a dark hand before a face. The illusion went with it, and the lights in the windows were extinguished. I looked upon a desolate shell, soulless at last, unhaunted, with no whisper of the past about its staring walls.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我一直没注意到，一朵乌云已经遮没了月亮。乌云有好一阵子徘徊不去，就像一只黑手遮住了脸庞。顿时，幻觉消失了，窗户的灯光也一齐熄灭。我面前的屋子终于又成了荒凉的空壳，没有灵魂，也无人进出。在那虎视眈眈的大墙边，再也听不到往事的细声碎语。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The house was a sepulchre, our fear and suffering lay buried in the ruins. There would be no resurrection. When I thought of Manderley in my waking hours I would not be bitter. I should think of it as it might have been, could I have lived there</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="曼陀丽是座坟墓，我们的恐惧和苦难都深埋在它的废墟之中。这一切再也不能死而复苏。我醒着的时候想到曼陀丽庄园，从不觉得难过。要是我曾在那儿无忧无虑地生活，说不定我还会就事论事地回想起那儿美好的一切：夏日的玫瑰园，拂晓时分的鸟语，栗子树下的午茶，还有草地那边传来的阵阵涛声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">without fear. I should remember the rose-garden in summer, and the birds that sang at dawn. Tea under the chestnut tree, and the murmur of the sea coming up to us from the lawns below. I would think of the blown lilac, and the Happy Valley. These things were permanent, they could not be dissolved. They were memories that cannot hurt. All this I resolved in my dream, while the clouds lay across the face of the moon, for like most sleepers I knew that I dreamed. In reality I lay many hundred miles away in an alien land, and would wake, before many seconds had passed, in the bare little hotel bedroom, comforting in its very lack of atmosphere. I would sigh a moment, stretch myself and turn, and opening my eyes, be bewildered at that glittering sun, that hard, clean sky, so different from the soft moonlight of my dream. The day would lie before us both, long no doubt, and uneventful, but fraught with a certain stillness, a dear tranquillity we had not known before. We would not talk of Manderley, I would not tell my dream. For Manderley was ours no longer. Manderley was no more.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我还会想到盛开的紫丁香，惦念起“幸福谷”。这一切都是永恒的，不可能像烟云般消散。这些回忆按理是不会惹人伤感的。月亮仍被乌云遮盖着。我虽在梦境之中，却清醒地想到了上面这一切，因为像所有梦中人一样，我知道自己是在做梦。事实上，我是躺在数百英里外的异国土地上，过不了几秒钟就要醒过来，发现自己睡在旅馆空荡荡的小房间里，没有任何特别的气氛，但也正因为如此，才令人感到舒坦释然。我会叹一口气，伸个懒腰，转过身子，睁开眼睛，迷惘地看看那耀眼的阳光和冷漠洁净的天空，这与梦中幽柔的月光是多么不同！白昼横在我俩前头，无疑既漫长又单调，同时却充满某种珍贵的平静感。这是我俩以前不曾体会过的。不，我们不会谈起曼陀丽，我可不愿讲述我的梦境，因为曼陀丽不再为我们所有，曼陀丽不复存在了！">查看中文翻译</div>
