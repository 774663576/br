<div class="line_en">Far and wide lay a ruined country, yielding nothing but desolation. Every green leaf, every blade of grass and blade of grain, was as shrivelled and poor as the miserable people. Everything was bowed down, dejected, oppressed, and broken. Habitations, fences, domesticated animals, men, women, children, and the soil that bore them -- all worn out.</div>

<div class="line_en">There was a change on the village where the fountain fell, and where the mender of roads went forth daily to hammer out of the stones on the highway such morsels of bread as might serve for patches to hold his poor ignorant soul and his poor reduced body together. The prison on the crag was not so dominant as of yore; there were soldiers to guard it, but not many; there were officers to guard the soldiers, but not one of them knew what his men would do -- beyond this: that it would probably not be what he was ordered.</div>

<div class="line_en">Monseigneur (often a most worthy individual gentleman) was a national blessing, gave a chivalrous tone to things, was a polite example of luxurious and shining life, and a great deal more to equal purpose; nevertheless, Monseigneur as a class had, somehow or other, brought things to this. Strange that Creation, designed expressly for Monseigneur, should be so soon wrung dry and squeezed out! There must be something short-sighted in the eternal arrangements, surely! Thus it was, however; and the last drop of blood having been extracted from the flints, and the last screw of the rack having been turned so often that its purchase crumbled, and it now turned and turned with nothing to bite, Monseigneur began to run away from a phenomenon so low and unaccountable.</div>

<div class="line_en">For, in these times, as the mender of roads worked, solitary, in the dust, not often troubling himself to reflect that dust he was and to dust he must return, being for the most part too much occupied in thinking how little he had for supper and how much more he would eat if he had it -- in these times, as he raised his eyes from his lonely labour, and viewed the prospect, he would see some rough figure approaching on foot, the like of which was once a rarity in those parts, but was now a frequent presence. As it advanced, the mender of roads would discern without surprise, that it was a shaggy-haired man, of almost barbarian aspect, tall, in wooden shoes that were clumsy even to the eyes of a mender of roads, grim, rough, swart, steeped in the mud and dust of many highways, dank with the marshy moisture of many low grounds, sprinkled with the thorns and leaves and moss of many byways through woods.</div>

<div class="line_en">But, this was not the change on the village, and on many a village like it. For scores of years gone by, Monseigneur had squeezed it and wrung it, and had seldom graced it with his presence except for the pleasures of the chase -- now, found in hunting the people; now, found in hunting the beasts, for whose preservation Monseigneur made edifying spaces of barbarous and barren wilderness. No. The change consisted in the appearance of strange faces of low caste, rather than in the disappearance of the high caste, chiselled, and otherwise beautified and beautifying features of Monseigneur.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是这座村子和许多类似的村子的变化并不在此。数十上百年来大人原本只对这村子进行挤压绞榨，很少亲自光临，只有狩猎寻乐时例外——他有时猎取的是人，有时猎取的是兽。而为了蕃息野兽，大人为它们的生长留出了大片土地，让它荒废。不，不，村子的变化不在于少了那身分高贵、雕像般漂亮、受福也赐福的面孔，而在于多了些身分低下的陌生面孔。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As the road-mender plied his dusty labour, and the hail-clouds, rolling away, revealed bright bars and streaks of sky which were responded to by silver gleams upon the landscape, the little man (who wore a red cap now, in place of his blue one) seemed fascinated by the figure on the heap of stones. His eyes were so often turned towards it, that he used his tools mechanically, and, one would have said, to very poor account. The bronze face, the shaggy black hair and beard, the coarse woollen red cap, the rough medley dress of home-spun stuff and hairy skins of beasts, the powerful frame attenuated by spare living, and the sullen and desperate compression of the lips in sleep, inspired the mender of roads with awe. The traveller had travelled far, and his feet were footsore, and his ankles chafed and bleeding; his great shoes, stuffed with leaves and grass, had been heavy to drag over the many long leagues, and his clothes were chafed into holes, as he himself was into sores. Stooping down beside him, the road-mender tried to get a peep at secret weapons in his breast or where not; but, in vain, for he slept with his arms crossed upon him, and set as resolutely as his lips. Fortified towns with their stockades, guard-houses, gates, trenches, and drawbridges, seemed to the mender of roads, to be so much air as against this figure. And when he lifted his eyes from it to the horizon and looked around, he saw in his small fancy similar figures, stopped by no obstacle, tending to centres all over France.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="补路工干起他那尘雾弥漫的活儿来。这时含着冰雹的云翻滚着散开了，露出了一道道青天，景物也随之闪出一道道银辉。现在用红帽代替了蓝帽的小个子补路工似乎被石堆上的人形迷住了，眼睛常朝他转过去，手上的工具虽机械地干着活，看来已没有多大作用。那人那青铜色的皮肤、乱蓬蓬的须发、粗糙的红色羊毛帽、家织呢和野兽皮混杂凑成的粗劣衣服、因为生活困苦而消瘦的健壮的个儿、睡着时那愠怒而凶狠地抿紧的嘴唇，这些都使补路工肃然起敬。旅客走了许多地方，脚已磨破，足踝上有伤，流着血；他那巨大的木鞋塞满了树叶和草。走了那么遥远的路，这鞋实在太沉重。他的衣服磨出了许多洞，身上也有许多伤。补路工弯下腰想看看他掖在胸口或其它地方的秘密武器，但是没看见，因为他睡觉时双臂合抱在胸前，捂得紧紧的，很像他那根紧的双唇。在补路工眼里，深沟高垒的城市的栅栏、哨所、大门、壕堑、吊桥在这个人面前都如烟云一样容易消散。等到他抬头看看地平线和四周时，他那小小的幻想之中有许多跟此人类似的人影正在所向披靡地扑向法兰西各个中心城市。">查看中文翻译</div>

Then, the mender of roads having got his tools together and all things ready to go down into the village, roused him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这人继续酣睡。冰雹一阵阵洒落，阳光与阴影在他脸上交替，冰珠打在他身上噗噗地响，又被太阳化作粒粒的金刚钻，可他全然不理会。太阳终于落了山，映出了一片晚霞，补路工收拾起工具打算下山回村了，这才叫醒了他。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The mender of roads went home, with the dust going on before him according to the set of the wind, and was soon at the fountain, squeezing himself in among the lean kine brought there to drink, and appearing even to whisper to them in his whispering to all the village. When the village had taken its poor supper, it did not creep to bed, as it usually did, but came out of doors again, and remained there. A curious contagion of whispering was upon it, and also, when it gathered together at the fountain in the dark, another curious contagion of looking expectantly at the sky in one direction only. Monsieur Gabelle, chief functionary of the place, became uneasy; went out on his house-top alone, and looked in that direction too; glanced down from behind his chimneys at the darkening faces by the fountain below, and sent word to the sacristan who kept the keys of the church, that there might be need to ring the tocsin by-and-bye.</div>

<div class="line_en">But, not for long. Presently, the chateau began to make itself strangely visible by some light of its own, as though it were growing luminous. Then, a flickering streak played behind the architecture of the front, picking out transparent places, and showing where balustrades, arches, and windows were. Then it soared higher, and grew broader and brighter. Soon, from a score of the great windows, flames burst forth, and the stone faces awakened, stared out of fire.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但这黑暗并不长久，府邸立即以它自己的光离奇地照亮了自己，仿佛正要变成一个发光体。然后一道火花四射的烈焰在前排建筑物的背后燃烧了起来，从透光处显露，照亮了栏杆、拱门和窗户，接着火焰便越燃越高，四面扩展，越发明亮了。很快，二十来扇大窗户都爆出了火焰，唤醒了石雕人面，一个个从火里往外瞪着眼。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The night deepened. The trees environing the old chateau, keeping its solitary state apart, moved in a rising wind, as though they threatened the pile of building massive and dark in the gloom. Up the two terrace flights of steps the rain ran wildly, and beat at the great door, like a swift messenger rousing those within; uneasy rushes of wind went through the hall, among the old spears and knives, and passed lamenting up the stairs, and shook the curtains of the bed where the last Marquis had slept. East, West, North, and South, through the woods, four heavy-treading, unkempt figures crushed the high grass and cracked the branches, striding on cautiously to come together in the courtyard. Four lights broke out there, and moved away in different directions, and all was black again.</div>

The mender of roads, and the two hundred and fifty particular friends, inspired as one man and woman by the idea of lighting up, had darted into their houses, and were putting candles in every dull little pane of glass. The general scarcity of everything, occasioned candles to be borrowed in a rather peremptory manner of Monsieur Gabelle; and in a moment of reluctance and hesitation on that functionary's part, the mender of roads, once so submissive to authority, had remarked that carriages were good to make bonfires with, and that post-horses would roast.</div>

<div class="line_en">The chateau burned; the nearest trees, laid hold of by the fire, scorched and shrivelled; trees at a distance, fired by the four fierce figures, begirt the blazing edifice with a new forest of smoke. Molten lead and iron boiled in the marble basin of the fountain; the water ran dry; the extinguisher tops of the towers vanished like ice before the heat, and trickled down into four rugged wells of flame. Great rents and splits branched out in the solid walls, like crystallisation; stupefied birds wheeled about and dropped into the furnace; four fierce figures trudged away, East, West, North, and South, along the night-enshrouded roads, guided by the beacon they had lighted, towards their next destination. The illuminated village had seized hold of the tocsin, and, abolishing the lawful ringer, rang for joy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="府第燃烧着；附近的树木一让火舌舔到便干焦萎缩；远处的森林被那四个凶恶的人点燃之后又用一道新的烟雾的森林把那烧得白炽的华厦包围起来。熔化的铅和铁在喷泉的大理石盆里沸腾，烧干了泉水；灭烛器似的塔楼尖顶在高温前像冰一样熔化，滴落下来变作了四个奇形怪状的火池；坚实的墙壁以结晶的纹样作树枝形迸裂，迸出了巨大的豁口和裂缝。鸟儿们吓昏了，在空中打着旋儿栽进大熔炉里。四个凶猛的形象在他们造成的灯塔光里大步地沿着为黑暗所包裹的道路向东西南北四面走去，走向新的目标。火光照耀的村子已夺走了警钟，赶走了法定敲钟人，自己欢乐地敲了起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Not only that; but the village, light-headed with famine, fire, and bell-ringing, and bethinking itself that Monsieur Gabelle had to do with the collection of rent and taxes -- though it was but a small instalment of taxes, and no rent at all, that Gabelle had got in those latter days -- became impatient for an interview with him, and, surrounding his house, summoned him to come forth for personal conference. Whereupon, Monsieur Gabelle did heavily bar his door, and retire to hold counsel with himself. The result of that conference was, that Gabelle again withdrew himself to his housetop behind his stack of chimneys; this time resolved, if his door were broken in (he was a small Southern man of retaliative temperament), to pitch himself head foremost over the parapet, and crush a man or two below.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这还不够，被饥馑、大火和钟声冲昏了头脑的村子想起了加伯尔先生还要收租税，便急于要跟他谈判，尽管加伯尔先生近来只收了一点分期交纳的赋税，而地租房租则分文未收。他们包围了他的房子，传唤他出来当而交谈。加伯尔先生只好把大门死死关闭，躲起来考虑办法。考虑的结果是重新躲到那排烟囱背后的屋顶上去。这回他下定了决心，若是门被闯开，他便从雉堞顶上栽下去抓住一两个人同归于尽（他是个南方人，个子虽小，复仇心却很重）。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Probably, Monsieur Gabelle passed a long night up there, with the distant chateau for fire and candle, and the beating at his door, combined with the joy-ringing, for music; not to mention his having an ill-omened lamp slung across the road before his posting-house gate, which the village showed a lively inclination to displace in his favour. A trying suspense, to be passing a whole summer night on the brink of the black ocean, ready to take that plunge into it upon which Monsieur Gabelle had resolved! But, the friendly dawn appearing at last, and the rush-candles of the village guttering out, the people happily dispersed, and Monsieur Gabelle came down bringing his life with him for that while.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="加伯尔先生在屋顶度过了一个漫长的黑夜。他很可能是把远处的府第当作了蜡烛，把打门声和快活的钟声当作了音乐的。至于摇晃在他那驿站门前街道边的不祥的路灯就更不用提了，村里人曾大呼小叫要拿他去跟路灯交换地位呢。他在黑漆漆的死亡的边缘整整度过了一个夏夜，随时准备照既定的决心栽下去！那提心吊胆的滋味是很考验入的。可是友善的黎明终于到来，村型的灯心草蜡烛也噼噼啪啪地熄灭了，人们快活地分散开去。加伯尔先生暂时抢得一条性命，下到了地面。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Within a hundred miles, and in the light of other fires, there were other functionaries less fortunate, that night and other nights, whom the rising sun found hanging across once-peaceful streets, where they had been born and bred; also, there were other villagers and townspeople less fortunate than the mender of roads and his fellows, upon whom the functionaries and soldiery turned with success, and whom they strung up in their turn. But, the fierce figures were steadily wending East, West, North, and South, be that as it would; and whosoever hung, fire burned. The altitude of the gallows that would turn to water and quench it, no functionary, by any stretch of mathematics, was able to calculate successfully.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天晚上和另外一些晚上，一百英里之内还烧起过许多处大火。那里的官员有些却未必那么幸运。太阳出山时，他们已被吊在曾经很平静的街道上——他们原是在那儿出生和成长的。也有的农村或城市的居民不如补路工和他的伙伴们那么幸运。官员和士兵们进行了反扑，也把他们吊了起来。但是凶狠的人们仍然不顾一切，坚定地在东西南北四处活动。无论绞死了谁，火照样放。官员们无论用什么数学公式计算，也算不出绞架要造多高才能变成水，把那场大火扑灭。">查看中文翻译</div>
