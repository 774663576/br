<div class="line_en">They had supper at a restaurant in Rome. She drank her wine in silence.</div>

<div class="line_en">She assured him she was not. She was still confused and unsure whether to be happy or not. She recalled the time they met in the sleeping compartment of the Amsterdam express, the time she had wanted to go down on her knees before him and beg him to hold her, squeeze her, never let her go. She had longed to come to the end of the dangerous road of betrayals. She had longed to call a halt to it all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她明确告诉他自己没生气。她仍然十分困惑，不知该不该开心。她想起他们在去阿姆斯特丹的火车卧铺车厢里相会的情景。那一晚，她曾想扑倒在他脚下，恳求他哪怕用暴力将她留在他身边，永远也不要再让她走。那一晚，她曾渴盼结束这从背叛到背叛的危险旅程，她曾渴盼停下脚步。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sabina felt as though Franz had pried open the door of their privacy. As though she were peering into the heads of Marie-Claude, of Marie-Anne, of Alain the painter, of the sculptor who held on to his finger -- of all the people she knew in Geneva. Now she would willynilly become the rival of a woman who did not interest her in the least. Franz would ask for a divorce, and she would take Marie-Claude's place in his large conjugal bed. Everyone would follow the process from a greater or lesser distance, and she would be forced to playact before them all; instead of being Sabina, she would have to act the role of Sabina, decide how best to act the role. Once her love had been publicized, it would gain weight, become a burden. Sabina cringed at the very thought of it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对萨比娜来说，这如同弗兰茨强行打开了她的私生活之门，仿佛看到窗口晃动着玛丽—克洛德的头，玛丽—安娜的头，画家阿兰的头，或是总捂着自己手指的那位雕塑家的头，看到她在日内瓦认识的所有人的头。她快要身不由己地成为一个她全不在意的女人的情敌。弗兰茨会离婚，而她将在一张巨大的婚床上取得他枕边的位置。远近的人全都会盯着看；她将不得不在所有人面前演戏；她将不再是萨比娜，而要被迫扮演萨比娜这个角色，并且找到扮演的方式。爱情一旦公之于众会变得沉重，成为负担。一想到这儿，她就已经直不起腰来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They walked back to the hotel through the streets of Rome. Because the Italians around them were making a racket, shouting and gesticulating, they could walk along in silence without hearing their silence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在繁华的夜景中，他们走回旅馆。在他们身边，意大利人吵吵闹闹，大叫大嚷，手舞足蹈。这样，他俩虽然默默地肩并肩走着，却听不出彼此的沉默。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Try as she might to intensify that longing, summon it to her aid, lean on it, the feeling of distaste only grew stronger.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="眼下，她竭尽全力试图回想起当时的渴望，想祈求他，依赖他。纯属徒劳。她的不安仍占了上风。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When she came out, she turned it off. It was the first time she had done so.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从浴室出来，她摁下了开关。这是她第一次这么做。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sabina spent a long time washing in the bathroom; Franz waited for her under the blanket. As always, the small lamp was lit.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="回来后，萨比娜在浴室梳洗了很久，而弗兰茨躺在那张夫妻大床上等着她。一盏小灯一如既往地亮着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Franz should have paid better attention. He did not notice it, because light did not mean anything to him. As we know, he made love with his eyes shut.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="弗兰茨本该留心她这一举动。他并没注意到，因为光线对于他无关紧要，我们知道，做爱时他总是闭着眼睛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In fact, it was his closed eyes that made Sabina turn out the light. She could not stand those lowered eyelids a moment longer. The eyes, as the saying goes, are windows to the soul. Franz's body, which thrashed about on top of hers with closed eyes, was therefore a body without a soul. It was like a newborn animal, still blind and whimpering for the dug. Muscular Franz in coitus was like a gigantic puppy suckling at her breasts. He actually had her nipple in his mouth as if he were sucking milk! The idea that he was a mature man below and a suckling infant above, that she was therefore having intercourse with a baby, bordered on the disgusting. No, she would never again see his body moving desperately over hers, would never again offer him her breast, bitch to whelp, today was the last time, irrevocably the last time!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="正是由于他紧闭的双眼萨比娜才将灯熄灭。她不愿看见，即便只是一秒，那垂下的眼帘。如俗语所说，眼睛是心灵之窗。弗兰茨的身体伏在她身上扭动，双眼紧闭，在她看来，这只是一具没有灵魂的躯体。他像是一只尚未睁眼的幼崽，因为饥渴而发出阵阵可怜的嗷叫。肌肉强健的弗兰茨做爱时就像一只吃奶的巨大幼犬。确实如此，他嘴里还含着她的一只乳头，如同吮奶一样！下半身的弗兰茨是个成年男子，而上半身则是个吮乳的婴儿，那么她是在跟一个婴儿上床，一想到这，她觉得厌恶到了极点。不，她再也不愿看到他无望地在她身上挣扎，再也不愿像母狗喂幼崽一样送上自己的乳房。今天是最后一次，无可挽回的最后一次！">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She knew, of course, that she was being supremely unfair, that Franz was the best man she had ever had -- he was intelligent, he understood her paintings, he was handsome and good -- but the more she thought about it, the more she longed to ravish his intelligence, defile his kindheartedness, and violate his powerless strength.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当然，她明白，自己的决定极不公平。弗兰茨是她所遇见的男人中最优秀的。他聪明，懂她的画。他善良，正直，英俊。但她心里愈清楚，愈想去践踏他的聪明、善良，践踏他那脆弱的强健。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That night, she made love to him with greater frenzy than ever before, aroused by the realization that this was the last time. Making love, she was far, far away. Once more she heard the golden horn of betrayal beckoning her in the distance, and she knew she would not hold out. She sensed an expanse of freedom before her, and the boundlessness of it excited her. She made mad, unrestrained love to Franz as she never had before.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这一夜，她以胜过往日的激情与他做爱，因为想到是最后一次而万分激动。她与他缠绵着，而心早已到了遥远的别处。她再度听见远方吹响叛逆的金号角，清楚自己无力抗拒那号声的召唤。她眼前仿佛展开了一片更为广阔的自由天地，那天地之广大令她兴奋。她疯狂而粗野地与弗兰茨做爱，好像从未曾有过那样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Franz sobbed as he lay on top of her; he was certain he understood: Sabina had been quiet all through dinner and said not a word about his decision, but this was her answer. She had made a clear show of her joy, her passion, her consent, her desire to live with him forever.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="弗兰茨在她身上唏嘘，他肯定明白了一切：晚餐时，萨比娜默不作声，也没跟他说对他的决定是怎么想的。可是现在，她回应了他。她在向他显示她的欢悦、激情、允诺和与他共度一生的渴望。">查看中文翻译</div>
