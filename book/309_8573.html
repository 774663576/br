Teams were well set. Garbage cans were used to mark out the goals.</div>

<div class="line_en">Insane or not, Rudy was always destined to be Liesel's best friend. A snowball in the face is surely the perfect beginning to a lasting friendship.</div>

<div class="line_en">On the way to school, he tried to point out certain landmarks in the town, or at least, he managed to slip it all in, somewhere between telling his younger siblings to shut their faces and the older ones telling him to shut his. His first point of interest was a small window on the second floor of an apartment block.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在上学的路上，他为莉泽尔介绍了镇上的几座标志性建筑，或者换种说法，他其实是在让弟弟妹妹闭嘴，以及哥哥姐姐让他闭嘴的间隙，向莉泽尔传递了这些信息。他感兴趣的第一处地点，是一座公寓二楼的一扇小窗户。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A few days after Liesel started school, she went along with the Steiners. Rudy's mother, Barbara, made him promise to walk with the new girl, mainly because she'd heard about the snowball. To Rudy's credit, he was happy enough to comply. He was not the junior misogynistic type of boy at all. He liked girls a lot, and he liked Liesel (hence, the snowball). In fact, Rudy Steiner was one of those audacious little bastards who actually fancied himself with the ladies. Every childhood seems to have exactly such a juvenile in its midst and mists. He's the boy who refuses to fear the opposite sex, purely because everyone else embraces that particular fear, and he's the type who is unafraid to make a decision. In this case, Rudy had already made up his mind about Liesel Meminger.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="开始上学后没几天，莉泽尔就跟施泰纳一家混熟了。鲁迪的妈妈芭芭拉要他答应上学放学的时候都陪着这个新来的女孩，主要是因为她听说了雪球事件，心里多少有些愧疚。至于鲁迪，他倒是乐于听从妈妈的命令。他并不是那种和女孩划清界限的男孩。他很喜欢女孩子，也喜欢莉泽尔（自从拿雪球打中她以后）。实际上，鲁迪·施泰纳是个胆大包天的小坏蛋，幻想着哪天能跟淑女们交往。每个人的童年中都隐隐约约有这样一个少年。他不会因为同龄人都害怕接触异性，自己也跟着对女孩子产生恐惧，而且，他还是个果敢的人。这一回，鲁迪已经下定决心，要和莉泽尔·梅明格好好相处。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Frau Diller was a sharp-edged woman with fat glasses and a nefarious glare. She developed this evil look to discourage the very idea of stealing from her shop, which she occupied with soldierlike posture, a refrigerated voice, and even breath that smelled like "heil Hitler." The shop itself was white and cold, and completely bloodless. The small house compressed beside it shivered with a little more severity than the other buildings on Himmel Street. Frau Diller administered this feeling, dishing it out as the only free item from her premises. She lived for her shop and her shop lived for the Third Reich. Even when rationing started later in the year, she was known to sell certain hard-to-get items under the counter and donate the money to the Nazi Party. On the wall behind her usual sitting position was a framed photo of the Fuhrer. If you walked into her shop and didn't say "heil Hitler," you wouldn't be served. As they walked by, Rudy drew Liesel's attention to the bulletproof eyes leering from the shop window.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪勒太太是个棱角分明的女人，戴着一副厚厚的眼镜，眼里散发出凶恶的光。她之所以这样凶神恶煞，是为了吓退那些想在她店里偷东西的念头。她像个士兵一样守在店里，声音冰冷，甚至连呼吸都带着“希特勒万岁”的味道。店铺本身也冷冰冰的，里面一片白色，没有一点人情味。挤在商店旁边的那间小屋子散发着一丝严厉的气息，比希默尔街上的其他房子都更严厉一些。迪勒太太便是这种压迫感的主宰，而这是她店里售卖的唯一一件免费商品。她为商店而活，商店则为第三帝国而活。那年晚些时候，国家开始实行配给制度，但大家都知道她的柜台里有一些很难买到的东西，而她把收入都捐给了纳粹党。她座位背后的墙上挂着镶着元首照片的相框。如果你进店时没说“希特勒万岁”，那她就不会搭理你。路过商店的时候，鲁迪让莉泽尔留心看，橱窗里面有一双百毒不侵的眼睛正满怀恶意地瞪着外面。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Say 'heil' when you go in there," he warned her stiffly. "Unless you want to walk a little farther." Even when they were well past the shop, Liesel looked back and the magnified eyes were still there, fastened to the window.</div>

<div class="line_en">Once they'd watched the soldiers disappear, the group of Steiners and Liesel walked past some shop windows and the imposing town hall, which in later years would be chopped off at the knees and buried. A few of the shops were abandoned and still labeled with yellow stars and anti-Jewish slurs. Farther down, the church aimed itself at the sky, its rooftop a study of collaborated tiles. The street, overall, was a lengthy tube of gray -- a corridor of dampness, people stooped in the cold, and the splashed sound of watery footsteps.</div>

He was only called Pfiffikus because you give that name to someone who likes to whistle, which Pfiffikus most definitely did. He was constantly whistling a tune called the Radetzky March, and all the kids in town would call out to him and duplicate that tune. At that precise moment, Pfiffikus would abandon his usual walking style (bent forward, taking large, lanky steps, arms behind his raincoated back) and erect himself to deliver abuse. It was then that any impression of serenity was violently interrupted, for his voice was brimming with rage.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="与此同时，老人挺直身子，继而恶毒地咒骂起来。说实话，恶毒到这个份上也是一种才能了。没有人知道他的真名，就算知道也没人喊过他。他之所以被叫作普菲夫克斯，是因为这是吹口哨的人专用的诨名，而普菲夫克斯的确喜欢吹口哨。他总在吹《拉德斯基进行曲》，镇上的孩子会一边逗他一边模仿这个调子。这个时候，普菲夫克斯会改变惯常的走路姿态（身体前倾，笨拙的步伐跨得很大，双臂背在雨衣后面），挺直身子开始骂人。他的声音里满是怒火，任何安宁的景象都会被粗暴地打破。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Pfiffikus!" she echoed, quickly adopting the appropriate cruelty that childhood seems to require. Her whistling was awful, but there was no time to perfect it.</div>

<div class="line_en">"You little slut!" he roared at her. The words clobbered her in the back. "I've never seen you before!" Fancy calling a ten-year-old girl a slut. That was Pfiffikus. It was widely agreed that he and Frau Holtzapfel would have made a lovely couple. "Get back here!" were the last words Liesel and Rudy heard as they continued running. They ran until they were on Munich Street.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你这个小婊子！”他朝她吼道，咒骂声从背后恶狠狠地传来，“我怎么没见过你！”想想看，竟然有人管一个十岁的女孩叫婊子。普菲夫克斯就是这种人。大家都觉得他跟霍尔茨埃普费尔女士是绝好的一对儿。莉泽尔和鲁迪继续逃跑，他们听到的最后一句话是：“你们给我回来！”但他们一直跑到了慕尼黑大街上。">查看中文翻译</div>
