Many people were only just realizing that something strange had happened; heads were still turning toward the silver cat as it vanished.

<div class="line_en">And then Ron was there. He caught hold of Hermione's free arm, and Harry felt her turn on the spot; sight and sound were extinguished as darkness pressed in upon him; all he could feel was Hermione's hand as he was squeezed through space and time, away from the Burrow, away from the descending Death Eaters, away, perhaps, from Voldemort himself…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="罗恩出现了。他抓住赫敏的另一只胳膊，哈利感觉到赫敏原地转了个身。黑暗向他袭来，眼前一片模糊，声音也听不见了，惟一感觉到的就是赫敏的手，他被挤压着穿越时空，离开了陋居，离开了那些从天而降的食死徒，还有，离开了伏地魔本人……">查看中文翻译</div>

A double-decker bus rumbled by and a group of merry pub-goers ogled them as they passed; Harry and Ron were still wearing dress robes.</div>

She gave the fragile-looking bag a little shake and it echoed like a cargo hold as a number of heavy objects rolled around inside it. "Oh, damn, that'll be the books," she said, peering into it, "and I had them all stacked by subject… Oh well… Harry, you'd better take the Invisibility Cloak. Ron, hurry up and change…"</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a small and shabby all-night café. A light layer of grease lay on all the Formica-topped tables, but it was at least empty. Harry slipped into a booth first and Ron sat next to him opposite Hermione, who had her back to the entrance and did not like it: She glanced over her shoulder so frequently she appeared to have a twitch. Harry did not like being stationary; walking had given the illusion that they had a goal. Beneath the Cloak he could feel the last vestiges of Polyjuice leaving him, his hands returning to their usual length and shape. He pulled his glasses out of his pocket and put them on again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是一间昼夜营业的破破烂烂的小咖啡馆。塑料贴面的桌子上粘着一层薄薄的油腻，但至少还算清静。哈利首先坐进一个火车座，罗恩坐在他旁边面对赫敏。赫敏背朝门口，很不自在，不停地扭头看看，像害了抽动症似的。哈利不喜欢坐着不动，刚才走路给了他一个错觉，好像他们还有个目标。隐形衣下，他感到复方汤剂的最后一点效果也在消失，他的手恢复了正常的大小和形状。他从口袋里掏出眼镜戴上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, as long as it doesn't get them into trouble, though they might've been arrested already. God, that's revolting," Ron added after one sip of the foamy, grayish coffee. The waitress had heard; she shot Ron a nasty look as she shuffled off to take the new customers' orders. The larger of the two workmen, who was blond and quite huge, now that Harry came to look at him, waved her away. She stared, affronted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好吧，只要不给他们惹麻烦，不过他们大概都已经被抓起来了。天哪，真恶心。”罗恩喝了口泛着泡沫的灰乎乎的咖啡，说了一句。女侍者听见了，朝罗恩狠狠瞪了一眼，懒洋洋地走过去招待新来的顾客。现在哈利看清了，两个工人里块头较大的那个一头金发，身材魁梧，他挥挥手叫女侍者走开。女侍者怔住了，像是受了委屈。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They relapsed into a prickly silence. The gum-chewing waitress shuffled over and Hermione ordered two cappuccinos: As Harry was invisible, it would have looked odd to order him one.

<div class="line_cn" title="他们气呼呼地陷入了沉默。嚼着口香糖的女侍者懒洋洋地走过来，赫敏要了两杯卡普奇诺。哈利是隐形的，如果给他要一杯给显得很反常。这时，两个膀大腰圆的工人走进咖啡馆，挤进了旁边的火车座里。赫敏把声音压得低低的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The two workmen made identical movements, and Harry mirrored them without conscious thought: All three of them drew their wands. Ron, a few seconds late in realizing what was going on, lunged across the table, pushing Hermione sideways onto her bench.

<div class="line_en">"Yeah, I do remember, thanks," said Harry through gritted teeth; he did not need Hermione to tell him that Voldemort had once used this selfsame connection between them to lead him into a trap, nor that it had resulted in Sirius's death. He wished that he had not told them what he had seen and felt; it made Voldemort more threatening, as though he were pressing against the window of the room, and still the pain in his scar was building and he fought it: It was like resisting the urge to be sick.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我记得，多谢你了。”哈利咬紧牙关说。他不需要赫敏提醒他伏地魔曾利用他们之间的这种联系，把他诱入一个陷阱，最后导致了小天狼星的死亡。他真希望自己没有把他看到的和感觉到的东西告诉他俩，这使伏地魔显得更加险恶了，似乎他就在这个房间的窗外虎视眈眈。伤疤的疼痛还在加剧，哈利拼命忍着恶心的感觉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What did you see?" Ron asked, advancing on Harry. "Did you see him at my place?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"But then you've got to close your mind!" said Hermione shrilly. "Harry, Dumbledore didn't want you to use that connection, he wanted you to shut it down, that's why you were supposed to use Occlumency! Otherwise Voldemort can plant false images in your mind, remember --"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那你必须封闭你的大脑！”赫敏尖声说道，“哈利，邓布利多不希望你使用那种联系，他希望你把它断掉，所以才让你用大脑封闭术！不然伏地魔就会把虚假的想法放进你的头脑，你还记得——”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="守护神消失得无影无踪。罗恩发出又像呜咽又像呻吟的声音，跌坐在沙发上，赫敏靠过去抓住他的胳膊。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's not a problem," said Harry, sickened by the pain in his head. "It's your family, "course you're worried. I'd feel the same way." He thought of Ginny. "I do feel the same way."</div>

<div class="line_en">He turned his back on Ron and Hermione, pretending to examine the old tapestry of the Black family tree on the wall. Then Hermione shrieked: Harry drew his wand again and spun around to see a silver Patronus soar through the drawing room window and land upon the floor in front of them, where it solidified into the weasel that spoke with the voice of Ron's father.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他转过去背朝罗恩和赫敏，假装端详墙上绘着布莱克家谱图的旧挂毯。突然赫敏尖叫起来，哈利又拔出魔杖，急转身子，却见一个银色的守护神穿过客厅的窗户，落到他们面前的地板上，变成了银色的鼬鼠，用罗恩父亲的声音说话了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The pain in his scar was reaching a peak, burning as it had done in the garden of the Burrow. Faintly he heard Hermione say, "I don't want to be on my own. Could we use the sleeping bags I've brought and camp in here tonight?"</div>

<div class="line_en">He barely made it: Bolting the door behind him with trembling hands, he grasped his pounding head and fell to the floor, then in an explosion of agony, he felt the rage that did not belong to him possess his soul, saw a long room lit only by firelight, and the great blond Death Eater on the floor, screaming and writhing, and a slighter figure standing over him, wand outstretched, while Harry spoke in a high, cold, merciless voice.</div>
