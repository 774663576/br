<div class="line_en">Once or twice each year, snow and sleet move into the area. When this happens, if the river is at its narrowest, or the creek shallow, there is a freeze which hardens the water to ice.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Canada geese knows this place, as do the white swans and the ducks who ride an inch above the waves of Chesapeake Bay as they skim their way into harbor. In the autumn, by the thousands, they come home for the winter.</div>

<div class="line_en">Where we live, on the Eastern shore of Maryland, the gentle waters run in and out like fingers slimming at the tips. They curl into the coves like tender palms.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们居住在马里兰州的东海岸，那里有潺潺的流水，似纤细的手指般蜿蜒流进流出，转入如温柔手掌般的海湾。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was on such a morning, near Oxford Maryland. That a friend of mine set the breakfast table beside the huge window, which overlooked the Tred Avon River. Across the river, beyond the dock, the snow laced the rim of the shore in white. For a moment she stood quietly, looking at what the night's storm had painted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一天清晨，我来到朋友家，一个靠近马里兰州牛津镇的地方。我的朋友把早餐桌放在一面巨大的窗户前。透过窗户，正好能够欣赏特爱温河的美景。河流的对岸是码头，白灿灿的积雪给整个河岸镶上了银边。她在窗前驻足了好一会儿，欣赏着昨夜暴风雪的杰作。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The swans move toward the shores in a stately glide, their tall heads proud and unafraid. They lower their long necks deep into the water, where their strong beaks dip through the river bottoms for food. And there is, between the arrogant swans and the prolific geese, an indifference, almost a disdain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="天鹅们通常高昂着头颅，以一种高傲姿态悠悠地飞向海岸，它们骄傲而无畏。将长长的脖子扎入水中，它们用坚硬的喙在河底寻觅食物。你总能感受到傲慢的天鹅对那一群群黑雁的冷漠，或是蔑视。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Suddenly she leaned forward and peered close to the frosted window. "It really is," she cried out loud. "There is goose out there." She reached to the bookcase and pulled out a pair of binoculars. Into their sights came the figure of a large Canada goose, very still, its wings folded tight to its sides, its feet frozen to the ice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然，她往前贴近结霜的窗户向外仔细看去。“是真的！”她大声说道，“那儿有一只黑雁。”她走到书柜前取出望远镜，镜筒中，她看到一只在雪中一动不动的大黑雁，翅膀紧紧地收合在身体两侧，双脚已经被冻在冰里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then from the dark skies, she saw a line of swans. They moved in their own singular formation, graceful, intrepid, and free. They crossed from the west of the broad creek high above the house, moving steadily to the east.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在昏暗的天空中飞来一排天鹅。它们以自己独特的队列飞行着，优雅，无畏，自在。穿过西部宽广的河面，越过高高的房顶，一直向东悠悠飞去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As my friend watched, the leader swung to the right, and then the white string of birds became a white circle. It floated from the top of the sky downward. At last, as easy as feathers coming to earth, the circle landed on the ice. My friend was on her feet now, with one unbelieving hand against her mouth. As the swans surrounded the frozen goose, she feared what life it still had might be packed out by those great swan bills.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="正当我朋友看着，领头鹅突然转向了右边，随后那一条白线变成一个白圈。白圈往下飘落，最后，像羽毛一般轻盈地落在冰面上。我的朋友不禁站起，惊讶地把手放在嘴上。天鹅们包围了这只冰冻的黑雁，我的朋友害怕它将在这群天鹅的利喙下变得千疮百孔。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Instead, amazingly instead, those bills began to woke on the ice. The long necks were lifted and curved down, again and again; it went on for a long time. At last, the goose was rimmed by a narrow margin of ice instead of the entire creek. The swans rose again, following the leader, and hovered in that circle, awaiting the results of their labors.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，令人惊讶的事情发生了。这群天鹅用它们的喙啄冰。那长长的脖子时而抬起时而低下，如此来回不停地啄食了好长时间。最后，冻住黑雁的整个冰碎成了小块。工作完成后，天鹅们随着领头鹅再次盘旋空中，绕成一个圈，等待着它们的劳动成果。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The goose's head lifted. Its body pulled. Then the goose was free and standing on the ice. It was moving its big webbed feet slowly. And the swans stood in the air watching. Then, as if it had cried, "I cannot fly," for of the swans came down around it. Their powerful beaks scraped the goose's wings from top to bottom, scuttled under its wings and rode up its body, chipping off the ice held in the feathers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="黑雁抬起头，身体伸展了一下，然后逃脱冰块站了起来。笨拙地移动着它那大大的脚掌。天鹅们在空中望着它。这时，黑雁好像叫了一声：“我没法儿飞了！”只见四只天鹅马上飞到它身旁，用坚硬的长喙上上下下里里外外地松开它的翅膀，蹭它的身体并啄掉它羽毛里的冰块。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Behind them, rising with incredible speed and joy, the goose moved into the sky. It followed them, flapping double time, until it caught up, until it joined the last end of the elegant line.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="而黑雁在获救后快活地飞进天空的怀抱，速度令人讶异。它紧随天鹅的队伍，加倍抖动双翅，终于赶上它们并完成了那优美线条最后一个点。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The goose spread its wings as far as they would go. When at last the wings reached their fullest, our swans took off and joined the hovering group. They resumed their eastward journey, in perfect formation, to their secret destination.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="黑雁试着努力伸展双翅，在翅膀完全展开后，四只天鹅飞回了那盘旋的队伍。它们恢复队列，继续向东飞行，飞往它们的秘密归宿。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">My friend watched them until they disappeared over the tips of the farthest trees. Only then did she realize that tears were running down her cheeks and had been for how long she don't know. This is a true story. I do not try to interpret it here. I just often think of it in the bad moments, and tell myself: "If so for birds, why not for man?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="直到它们的身影远远消逝，我朋友才回过神，也是在这时她才发现自己早已泪流满面。这是一个真实的故事，我在这里不想去诠释它。我只是在困境中常想起这个故事，并对自己说：“鸟儿尚且如此，何况人呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>
