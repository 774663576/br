<div class="line_en">Judging by the sleepy silence and the freshly minted look of that beam of sunlight, it was just after daybreak. He pulled open the curtains around his bed, got up and started to dress. The only sound apart from the distant twittering of birds was the slow, deep breathing of his fellow Gryffindors. He opened his schoolbag carefully, pulled out parchment and quill and headed out of the dormitory for the common room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="四下里是一片熟睡中的寂静，那一缕阳光仿佛是刚刚打造出来的，看来天还刚刚亮。哈利拉开床周围的帘子，开始起床穿衣服。除了远处小鸟叽叽喳喳的啁啾，惟一的声音就是他那些格兰芬多同学缓慢、均匀的呼吸声。他小心翼翼地打开书包，拿出羊皮纸和羽毛笔，离开宿舍朝公共休息室走去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry was first to wake up in his dormitory next morning. He lay for a moment watching dust swirl in the ray of sunlight coming through the gap in his four-poster's hangings, and savoured the thought that it was Saturday. The first week of term seemed to have dragged on for ever, like one gigantic History of Magic lesson.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天早晨，哈利是宿舍里第一个醒来的。他在床上躺了一会几，望着灰尘在从四柱床幔帐缝隙中透进来的那缕阳光中飞旋起舞，喜滋滋地想起了今天是星期六。新学期的第一个星期太漫长了，似乎永远熬不到尽头。就像一堂没完没了的魔法史课。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Making straight for his favourite squashy old armchair beside the now extinct fire, Harry settled himself down comfortably and unrolled his parchment while looking around the room. The detritus of crumpled-up bits of parchment, old Gobstones, empty ingredient jars and sweet wrappers that usually covered the common room at the end of each day was gone, as were all Hermione's elf hats. Wondering vaguely how many elves had now been set free whether they wanted to be or not, Harry uncorked his ink bottle, dipped his quill into it, then held it suspended an inch above the smooth yellowish surface of his parchment, thinking hard… but after a minute or so he found himself staring into the empty grate, at a complete loss for what to say.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利径直走向已经熄灭的炉火旁他最喜欢的那张松松软软的旧扶手椅，舒舒服服地坐下来，展开羊皮纸，一边打量着房间里的情景。平常一天下来，公共休息室里总是散了一地的羊皮纸团、破旧的高布石、空原料罐和糖纸，现在这些垃圾都不见了，同样不见的还有赫敏织的那些家养小精灵的帽子。哈利模模糊糊地想，不知道现在有多少小精灵被释放了，也不管他们愿意不愿意，他一边这么想着一边打开墨水瓶的盖子，把羽毛笔伸进去蘸了蘸，然后让笔尖悬在光滑、泛黄的羊皮纸面上一英寸的地方，苦苦思索着…一两分钟后，他发现自己在盯着空空的壁炉发呆，根本不知道该写些什么。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="我们有了一位新的黑魔法防御术课老师，乌姆里奇教授。她差不多像你妈妈一样好。我今天写信给你，是因为去年夏天我写信告诉你的那件事昨晚又出现了，当时我正在乌姆里奇那里关禁闭。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He sat quite motionless for a while, gazing into the fireplace, then, finally coming to a decision, he dipped his quill into the ink bottle once more and set it resolutely on the parchment.</div>

<div class="line_en">He could now appreciate how hard it had been for Ron and Hermione to write him letters over the summer. How was he supposed to tell Sirius everything that had happened over the past week and pose all the questions he was burning to ask without giving potential letter-thieves a lot of information he did not want them to have?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他现在才理解罗恩和赫敏暑假里给他写信有多么难了。他怎么才能把刚过去的这一星期发生的每一件事都告诉小天狼星，并提出他迫不及待地想问的所有问题，同时又不能让潜在的偷信贼得到许多他不想让他们知道的情报呢？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry reread the letter several times, trying to see it from the point of view of an outsider. He could not see how they would know what he was talking about -- or who he was talking to -- just from reading this letter. He did hope Sirius would pick up the hint about Hagrid and tell them when he might be back. Harry did not want to ask directly in case it drew too much attention to what Hagrid might be up to while he was not at Hogwarts.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利把信读了好几遍，竭力从一个局外人的角度来审视它。他觉得，光靠读这封信，局外人决不会知道他在说什么——或在跟谁说话。他真希望小天狼星能够读懂关于海格的暗示，并告诉他们海格大概什么时候才能回来。哈利不想直接地问，担心会弓l起别人的过多注意，怀疑海格不在霍格沃茨会去做什么。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I would not go that way if I were you," said Nearly Headless Nick, drifting disconcertingly through a wall just ahead of Harry as he walked down the passage. "Peeves is planning an amusing joke on the next person to pass the bust of Paracelsus halfway down the corridor."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“如果我是你，我才不会走那条路呢。”正当哈利走在过道里时，差点没头的尼克突然从他面前的墙里飘了出来，惊得他不知所措，“皮皮鬼正在搞一个滑稽的玩笑，要捉弄下一个从走廊中间帕拉瑟胸像前面走过的人呢。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“是不是让帕拉瑟掉在那个人的头顶上？”哈利问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yeah, bye," said Harry and instead of turning right, he turned left, taking a longer but safer route up to the Owlery. His spirits rose as he walked past window after window showing brilliantly blue sky; he had training later, he would be back on the Quidditch pitch at last.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好的，再见。”哈利没有向右转，而是向左转，走了一条较远但更安全的路去猫头鹰棚屋。他走过一个又一个窗口，都能看到外面蔚蓝明亮的天空，这使他的心情越来越好，他待会儿还要参加训练，终于又能回到魁地奇球场了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Funnily enough, it does," said Nearly Headless Nick in a bored voice. "Subtlety has never been Peeves's strong point. I'm off to try and find the Bloody Baron… he might be able to put a stop to it… see you, Harry…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“太有趣了，确实如此，”差点没头的尼克用厌烦的声音说，“皮皮鬼从来玩不出什么巧妙精细的把戏。我得赶紧去找血人巴罗…他大概能够制止这件事…再见，哈利…”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Considering it was a very short letter, it had taken a long time to write; sunlight had crept halfway across the room while he had been working on it and he could now hear distant sounds of movement from the dormitories above. Sealing the parchment carefully, he climbed through the portrait hole and headed off for the Owlery.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这封信很短，相比之下所花的时间就很长了。在他写信的工夫，阳光已经慢慢照到屋子中间，现在他能隐约地听见楼上宿舍里的动静了。他小心地把羊皮纸封好，爬过肖像洞口，直奔猫头鹰棚屋去了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Something brushed his ankles. He looked down and saw the caretaker's skeletal grey cat, Mrs Norris, slinking past him. She turned lamplike yellow eyes on him for a moment before disappearing behind a statue of Wilfred the Wistful.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="什么东西蹭了他的脚脖子一下。他低头一看，只见管理员的那只瘦骨如柴的灰猫洛丽丝夫人悄没声儿地走了过去。它用两只灯泡般的黄眼睛盯着他看了片刻，然后钻到忧郁的威尔福雕像后面不见了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm not doing anything wrong," Harry called after her. She had the unmistakeable air of a cat that was off to report to her boss, yet Harry could not see why; he was perfectly entitled to walk up to the Owlery on a Saturday morning.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我没做什么坏事。”哈利冲着它身后喊道。看它那样子，无疑是一只急急忙忙去找主人汇报的猫，而哈利不明白这是为什么。他完全有资格在一个星期六早晨到猫头鹰棚屋去呀。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The sun was high in the sky now and when Harry entered the Owlery the glassless windows dazzled his eyes; thick silvery beams of sunlight crisscrossed the circular room in which hundreds of owls nestled on rafters, a little restless in the early-morning light, some clearly just returned from hunting. The straw-covered floor crunched a little as he stepped across tiny animal bones, craning his neck for a sight of Hedwig.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在太阳已经高高地挂在天空，哈利走进棚屋时，没有玻璃的窗户晃得他睁不开眼睛。一道道银白色的阳光纵横交错地照进这个圆形房间，几百只猫头鹰栖息在椽木上，在早晨的光线中显得有点儿焦躁不安，有几只显然是刚从外面捕食回来。哈利伸长脖子寻找海德薇的身影时，脚下踩着细碎的动物骨头，铺着稻草的地面上发出嘎吱嘎吱的响声。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Right, I know this says Snuffles on the outside," he told her, giving her the letter to clasp in her beak and, without knowing exactly why, whispering, "but it's for Sirius, OK?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，我知道外面写的是‘伤风’，”哈利对它说，一边把信拿给它用嘴叼住，然后他也不知道为什么，又压低声音说，“但是给小天狼星的，明白吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">With a low hoot she stretched her great white wings and soared down on to his shoulder.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="海德薇低低地叫了一声，展开巨大的白色翅膀飞下来落在他的肩头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Safe flight, then," said Harry and he carried her to one of the windows; with a moments pressure on his arm, Hedwig took off into the blindingly bright sky. He watched her until she became a tiny black speck and vanished, then switched his gaze to Hagrid's hut, clearly visible from this window, and just as clearly uninhabited, the chimney smokeless, the curtains drawn.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那就祝你一路平安。”哈利说着，带着它来到一扇窗口。海德薇用力蹬了一下他的胳膊，腾身跃起，飞到了外面明晃晃的晴朗天空中。他一直注视着它，直到它变成了一个小黑点，彻底消失不见了，然后他把目光转向海格的小屋，从这扇窗户正好可以看得很清楚，然而烟囱没有冒烟，窗帘拉得紧紧的，很明显仍然没有住人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She blinked her amber eyes once and he took that to mean that she understood.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="海德薇眨了一下琥珀色的眼睛，哈利知道这表示它听明白了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The treetops of the Forbidden Forest swayed in a light breeze. Harry watched them, savouring the fresh air on his face, thinking about Quidditch later… then he saw it. A great, reptilian winged hcrse, just like the ones pulling the Hogwarts carriages, with leahery black wings spread wide like a pterodactyl's, rose up out of the trees like a grotesque, giant bird. It soared in a great circle, then plunged back into the trees. The whole thing had happened so quickly, Harry could hardly believe what he had seen, except that his heart was hammering madly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="禁林的树梢在微风中轻轻摇摆，哈利望着它们，享受着新鲜空气吹拂在脸上的愉快感觉，心里想着待会儿的魁地奇球训练…就在这时，他看见了它——一匹巨大的、爬行动物般的、带翅膀的马，跟那天拉着霍格沃茨马车的那些怪马一模一样。只见它像翼手龙一般将坚韧的黑色翅膀充分展开，忽地从树丛中飞了出来，如同一只奇异的巨鸟。它盘旋了一大圈，又忽地一头扎进树丛。整个事情发生得太快了，哈利简直不敢相信他看到的情景，只知道自己的心像打鼓一样怦怦地狂跳。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">From something the Minister let slip when telling me you are now a prefect, I gather that you are still seeing a lot of Harry Potter. I must tell you, Ron, that nothing could put you in danger of losing your badge more than continued fraternisation with that boy. Yes, I am sure you are surprised to hear this -- no doubt you will say that Potter has always been Dumbledore's favourite -- but I feel bound to tell you that Dumbledore may not be in charge at Hogwarts much longer and the people who count have a very different -- and probably more accurate -- view of Potter's behaviour. I shall say no more here, but if you look at the Daily Prophet tomorrow you will get a good idea of the way the wind is blowing -- and see if you can spot yours truly!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="部长告诉我你被选为级长时漏了点口风，我听出你现在还经常跟哈利．波特泡在一起。我必须告诉你，罗恩，如果你继续和那个男孩打得火热，就极有危险丢掉你的级长徽章。是的，我相信你听了这话会感到吃惊——你无疑会说波特一直是邓布利多的得意门生——可是我觉得我有必要告诉你，邓布利多在霍格沃茨当权的日子可能不会很长了，权威人士对波特的行为有着截然不同——也许更加准确——的看法。我这里不便多说，但如果你看了明天的《预言家日报》，就会清楚地明白现在的风向——看你是不是能够确定自己的立场！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Seriously, Ron, you do not want to be tarred with the same brush as Potter, it could be very damaging to your future prospects, and I am talking here about life after school, too. As you must be aware, given that our father escorted him to court, Potter had a disciplinary hearing this summer in front of the whole Wizengamot and he did not come out of it looking too good. He got off on a mere technicality, if you ask me, and many of the people I've spoken to remain convinced of his guilt.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="严肃地说，罗恩，你不应该与波特成为一路货色，这可能对你未来的前途十分不利，我这里说的还有走出校门以后的人生。你肯定知道，因为是我们的父亲陪他去法庭的，波特今年夏天受到整个威森加摩的审讯，而他是侥幸才逃脱罪责的。我个人认为，他是凭借技巧才勉强脱身，与我交谈过的许多人都仍然相信他是有罪的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This leads me to my other bit of advice. As I have hinted above, Dumbledore's regime at Hogwarts may soon be over. Your loyalty, Ron, should be not to him, but to the school and the Ministry. I am very sorry to hear that, so far, Professor Umbridge is encountering very little co-operation from staff as she strives to make those necessary changes within Hogwarts that the Ministry so ardently desires (although she should find this easier from next week -- again, see the Daily Prophet tomorrow!). I shall say only this -- a student who shows himself willing to help Professor Umbridge now may be very well-placed for Head Boyship in a couple of years!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="说到这里，我不妨再给你一点告诫。正如我前面提到过的，邓布利多在霍格沃茨掌权的日子可能很快就要结束了。罗恩，你不应该效忠于他，而应该效忠于学校和魔法部。我十分遗憾地听说，迄今为止，乌姆里奇教授努力在霍格沃茨贯彻魔法部极力倡导的变革时，居然很少得到其他教员的支持合作。（不过她下个星期就会发现工作更容易开展了——同样请看明天的《预言家日报》！）我只想说明一点——如果某个学生眼下表现出愿意帮助乌姆里奇教授，两午后便很有可能成为男生学生会主席！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It may be that you are afraid to sever ties with Potter -- I know that he can be unbalanced and, for all I know, violent -- but if you have any worries about this, or have spotted anything else in Potter's behaviour that is troubling you, I urge you to speak to Dolores Umbridge, a truly delightful woman who I know will be only too happy to advise you.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="也许你不敢与波特断绝关系——我知道他可能已精神错乱，而且据我所知，还有暴力倾向——如果你确实有这方面的顾虑，或发现波特的举止还有令你感到不安的地方，我恳请你找多洛雷斯鸟姆里奇谈谈，她是一个十分可爱随和的女人，我知道她一定很乐意给你一些忠告。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I am sorry that I was unable to see more of you over the summer. It pains me to criticise our parents, but I am afraid I can no longer live under their roof while they remain mixed up with the dangerous crowd around Dumbledore. (If you are writing to Mother at any point, you might tell her that a certain Sturgis Podmore, who is a great friend of Dumbledore's, has recently been sent to Azkaban for trespass at the Ministry. Perhaps that will open their eyes to the kind of petty criminals with whom they are currently rubbing shoulders.) I count myself very lucky to have escaped the stigma of association with such people -- the Minister really could not be more gracious to me -- and I do hope, Ron, that you will not allow family ties to blind you to the misguided nature of our parents' beliefs and actions, either. I sincerely hope that, in time, they will realise how mistaken they were and I shall, of course, be ready to accept a full apology when that day comes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="很遗憾我暑假里未能经常看见你。我很不愿意批评我们的父母，但如果他们继续跟邓布利多周围那帮危险人物混在一起，我恐怕再也不能与他们生活在同一个屋檐下了。（如果你什么时候给母亲写信，不妨告诉她说，有一个叫斯多吉波德摩的人，是邓布利多的密友，最近因非法侵入魔法部而被送进了阿兹卡班。也许这会使他们看清他们目前交往的都是怎样一些下三烂的罪犯。）我认为自己十分幸运地及时摆脱了与这帮人为伍的耻辱——部长对我真是宽宏大量——因此我真心希望，罗恩，你也不要让亲情蒙蔽了你的双眼，看不清我们父母的信仰和行为的错误性质。我真诚地希望，他们总有一天会认识到自己错了，当然，当那一天到来时，我将很愿意接受他们由衷的道歉。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yeah, and Dumbledore said it happened whenever Voldemort was feeling a powerful emotion," said Harry, ignoring, as usual, Ron and Hermione's winces. "So maybe he was just, I dunno, really angry or something the night I had that detention."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是啊，邓布利多说每当伏地魔有强烈的情绪波动时，我的伤疤就会疼，”哈利说，他像平常一样假装没有看见罗恩和赫敏脸上的恐惧表情，“所以，我关禁闭的那天晚上，他大概正好——也许是特别生气什么的吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Scared of them, I expect," said Sirius, smiling at her indignation. "Apparently, she loathes part-humans; she campaigned to have merpeople rounded up and tagged last year, too.
