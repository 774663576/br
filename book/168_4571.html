<div class="line_en">Dany broke her fast under the persimmon tree that grew in the terrace garden, watching her dragons chase each other about the apex of the Great Pyramid where the huge bronze harpy once stood. Meereen had a score of lesser pyramids, but none stood even half as tall. From here she could see the whole city: the narrow twisty alleys and wide brick streets, the temples and granaries, hovels and palaces, brothels and baths, gardens and fountains, the great red circles of the fighting pits. And beyond the walls was the pewter sea, the winding Skahazadhan, the dry brown hills, burnt orchards, and blackened fields. Up here in her garden Dany sometimes felt like a god, living atop the highest mountain in the world.</div>

<div class="line_en">Do all gods feel so lonely? Some must, surely. Missandei had told her of the Lord of Harmony, worshiped by the Peaceful People of Naath; he was the only true god, her little scribe said, the god who always was and always would be, who made the moon and stars and earth, and all the creatures that dwelt upon them. Poor Lord of Harmony. Dany pitied him. it must be terrible to be alone for all time, attended by hordes of butterfly women you could make or unmake at a word. Westeros had seven gods at least, though Viserys had told her that some septons, said the seven were only aspects of a single god, seven facets of a single crystal. That was just confusing. The red priests believed in two gods, she had heard, but two who were eternally at war. Dany liked that even less. She would not want to be eternally at war.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="神灵都这样孤独吗？有些定然是。弥桑黛给她讲过和谐之神，“和平之民”纳斯人所崇拜的神；据小文书说，他是唯一的真神，过去将来永恒存在，是他创造了月亮和星辰，创造了大地以及一切居住其中的生灵。可怜的和谐之神。丹妮很同情他。永远地独处一定非常可怕，侍奉你的只有所谓的蝴蝶仙女，而你可以随时创造或毁灭她们。维斯特洛至少有七个神，尽管韦赛里斯告诉她，有些修士说那只是同一个神的不同外表，同一颗水晶的七个平面。那太令人迷惑了。听说红袍僧们信仰两个神，但这两个神却处于永恒的斗争中。丹妮更不喜欢。她才不想处于永恒的斗争中。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Missandei served her duck eggs and dog sausage, and half a cup of sweetened wine mixed with the juice of a lime. The honey drew flies, but a scented candle drove them off. The flies were not so troublesome up here as they were in the rest of her city, she had found, something else she liked about the pyramid. "I must remember to do something about the flies," Dany said. "Are there many flies on Naath, Missandei?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="弥桑黛奉上鸭蛋和狗肠，外加半杯酸柑汁兑的甜酒。蜂蜜招来了苍蝇，但一支熏香蜡烛即将它们赶走。她发现在如此高处，苍蝇不像城里其他地方那样讨厌，这是她喜欢金字塔的又一个地方。“我得采取措施对付苍蝇，”丹妮说，“纳斯的苍蝇多吗，弥桑黛？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No. I must hold court soon." Dany had grown very fond of Missandei. The little scribe with the big golden eyes was wise beyond her years. She is brave as well. She had to be, to survive the life she's lived. One day she hoped to see this fabled isle of Naath. Missandei said the Peaceful People made music instead of war. They did not kill, not even animals; they ate only fruit and never flesh. The butterfly spirits sacred to their Lord of Harmony protected their isle against those who would do them harm. Many conquerors had sailed on Naath to blood their swords, only to sicken and die. The butterflies do not help them when the slave ships come raiding, though. "I am going to take you home one day, Missandei," Dany promised. If I had made the same promise to Jorah, would he still have sold me? "I swear it."</div>

<div class="line_en">Jhiqui helped Missandei bathe her while Irri was laying out her clothes. Today she wore a robe of purple samite and a silver sash, and on her head the three-headed dragon crown the Tourmaline Brotherhood had given her in Qarth. Her slippers were silver as well, with heels so high that she was always half afraid she was about to topple over. When she was dressed, Missandei brought her a polished silver glass so she could see how she looked. Dany stared at herself in silence. Is this the face of a conqueror? So far as she could tell, she still looked like a little girl.</div>

<div class="line_en">No one was calling her Daenerys the Conqueror yet, but perhaps they would. Aegon the Conqueror had won Westeros with three dragons, but she had taken Meereen with sewer rats and a wooden cock, in less than a day. Poor Groleo. He still grieved for his ship, she knew. If a war galley could ram another ship, why not a gate? That had been her thought when she commanded the captains to drive their ships ashore. Their masts had become her battering rams, and swarms of freedmen had torn their hulls apart to build mantlets, turtles, catapults, and ladders. The sellwords had given each ram a bawdy name, and it had been the mainmast of Meraxes -- formerly Joso's Prank that had broken the eastern gate. Joso's Cock, they called it. The fighting had raged bitter and bloody for most of a day and well into the night before the wood began to splinter and Meraxes' iron figurehead, a laughing jester's face, came crashing through.</div>

<div class="line_en">When the last resistance had been crushed by the Unsullied and the sack had run its course, Dany entered her city. The dead were heaped so high before the broken gate that it took her freedmen near an hour to make a path for her silver. Joso's Cock and the great wooden turtle that had protected it, covered with horsehides, lay abandoned within. She rode past burned buildings and broken windows, through brick streets where the gutters were choked with the stiff and swollen dead. Cheering slaves lifted bloodstained hands to her as she went by, and called her "Mother."</div>

<div class="line_en">Dany had wanted to lead the attack herself, but to a man her captains said that would be madness, and her captains never agreed on anything. Instead she remained in the rear, sitting atop her silver in a long shirt of mail. She heard the city fall from half a league away, though, when the defenders' shouts of defiance changed to cries of fear. Her dragons had roared as one in that moment, filling the night with flame. The slaves are rising, she knew at once. My sewer rats have gnawed off their chains.</div>

<div class="line_en">Her audience chamber was on the level below, an echoing highceilinged room with walls of purple marble. It was a chilly place for all its grandeur. There had been a throne there, a fantastic thing of carved and gilded wood in the shape of a savage harpy. She had taken one long look and commanded it be broken up for firewood. "I will not sit in the harpy's lap," she told them. Instead she sat upon a simple ebony bench. it served, though she had heard the Meereenese muttering that it did not befit a queen. Her bloodriders were waiting for her. Silver bells tinkled in their oiled braids, and they wore the gold and jewels of dead men. Meereen had been rich beyond imagining. Even her sellswords seemed sated, at least for now. Across the room, Grey Worm wore the plain uniform of the Unsullied, his spiked bronze cap beneath one arm. These at least she could rely on, or so she hoped… and Brown Ben Plumm as well, solid Ben with his grey-white hair and weathered face, so beloved of her dragons. And Daario beside him, glittering in gold. Daario and Ben Plumm, Grey Worm, Irri, Jhiqui, Missandei… as she looked at them Dany found herself wondering which of them would betray her next.</div>

While joso's Cock and the other rams were battering the city gates and her archers were firing flights of flaming arrows over the walls, Dany had sent two hundred men along the river under cover of darkness to fire the hulks in the harbor. But that was only to hide their true purpose. As the flaming ships drew the eyes of the defenders on the walls, a few half-mad swimmers found the sewer mouths and pried loose a rusted iron grating. Ser Jorah, Ser Barristan, Strong Belwas, and twenty brave fools slipped beneath the brown water and up the brick tunnel, a mixed force of sellswords, Unsullied, and freedmen.

One man was killed by a great pale lizard that reared up out of the dark water to drag him off by the leg, but when next ripples were spied Ser Jorah butchered the beast with his blade. They took some wrong turnings, but once they found the surface Strong Belwas led them to the nearest fighting pit, where they surprised a few guards and struck the chains off the slaves.

I should have kept him, or I should have killed him. She played at being a queen, yet sometimes she still felt like a scared little girl. Viserys always said what a dolt I was. Was he truly mad?

The air was chilly, but she liked the feel of grass between her toes and the sound of the leaves whispering to one another. Wind ripples chased each other across the surface of the little bathing pool and made the moon's reflection dance and shimmer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她站起身，留下伊丽在月光中沉睡。姬琪和弥桑黛睡在自己的床上。丹妮披上长袍，赤脚踏过大理石地板，走到外面的平台。空气很凉，但她喜欢青草在趾间的感觉，喜欢树叶低语互诉的声音。风吹起涟漪，在小浴池表面互相追逐，令月亮的倒影跳跃闪烁。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Later, when the time came for sleep, Dany took Irri into bed with her, for the first time since the ship. But even as she shuddered in release and wound her fingers through her handmaid's thick black hair, she pretended it was Drogo holding her… only somehow his face kept turning into Daario's. If I want Daario I need only say so. She lay with Irri's legs entangled in her own. His eyes looked almost purple today…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="睡觉时，丹妮让伊丽陪床，这是自船上以来的第一次。当她的手指缠绕于侍女浓密的黑发，在颤抖中达到高潮时，她幻想抱着自己的是卓戈…只不过他的脸时不时变成达里奥。想要达里奥，说出来就行。她的腿和伊丽的腿纠结在一起。今天他的眼睛看上去几乎是紫色…">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"A red door?" Missandei was puzzled. "What house is this?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“红门？”弥桑黛很疑惑，“什么宅子？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She was Daenerys Stormborn, the Unburnt, khaleesi and queen, Mother of Dragons, slayer of warlocks, breaker of chains, and there was no one in the world that she could trust.</div>

<div class="line_en">"My city," said Dany. "I was looking for a house with a red door, but by night all the doors are black."</div>

<div class="line_en">She leaned against a low brick parapet to look down upon the city. Meereen was sleeping too. Lost in dreams of kinder days, perhaps. Night covered the streets like a black blanket, hiding the corpses and the grey rats that came up from the sewers to feast on them, the swarms of stinging flies. Distant torches glimmered red and yellow where her sentries walked their rounds, and here and there she saw the faint glow of lanterns bobbing down an alley. Perhaps one was Ser Jorah, leading his horse slowly toward the gate. Farewell, old bear. Farewell, betrayer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她倚在低矮的砖墙上俯瞰城市。弥林沉睡。也许是沉浸在美梦里，梦中有好日子。夜晚如黑色的地毯，覆盖街道，遮掩了尸体和从下水道上来享用尸体的灰老鼠，遮掩了群群烦人的苍蝇。远处的火炬闪烁着红黄光芒，那是她巡逻的哨兵，时不时，各处有泛着微光的油灯沿小巷摇摇晃晃地前进。也许其中一盏便是乔拉爵士，缓缓引马往城门而去。别了，大熊。别了，叛徒。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Your Grace?" Missandei stood at her elbow wrapped in a bedrobe, wooden sandals on her feet. "I woke, and saw that you were gone. Did you sleep well? What are you looking at?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"No house. It does not matter." Dany took the younger girl by the hand. "Never lie to me, Missandei. Never betray me."</div>

<div class="line_en">The sky had turned a cobalt blue from the horizon to the zenith, and behind the line of low hills to the east a glow could be seen, pale gold and oyster pink. Dany held Missandei's hand as they watched the sun come up. All the grey bricks became red and yellow and blue and green and orange. The scarlet sands of the fighting pits transformed them into bleeding sores before her eyes. Elsewhere the golden dome of the Temple of the Graces blazed bright, and bronze stars winked along the walls where the light of the rising sun touched the spikes on the helms of the Unsullied. On the terrace, a few flies stirred sluggishly. A bird began to chirp in the persimmon tree, and then two more. Dany cocked her head to hear their song, but it was not long before the sounds of the waking city drowned them out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="地平线升至天顶，天空转为钴蓝，东方低矮的群山背后，一抹亮光浮现，淡淡的金和珍珠般的粉。丹妮挽起弥桑黛的手，两女并肩观看日出。灰色的砖块变成红黄橙绿蓝，斗技场猩红色的沙子耀得眼睛生疼，圣恩神庙的金色圆顶反射出强烈的辉芒，城墙上闪烁着青铜的星——那是旭日的光辉照到无垢者头盔的尖刺之上。平台花园里，若干苍蝇呆滞地飞舞。柿子树上的鸟儿开始呜叫，一只，两只。丹妮昂头听它们唱歌，但很快，城市的声音就淹没了一切。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That morning she summoned her captains and commanders to the garden, rather than descending to the audience chamber. "Aegon the Conqueror brought fire and blood to Westeros, but afterward he gave them peace, prosperity, and justice. But all I have brought to Slaver's Bay is death and ruin. I have been more khal than queen, smashing and plundering, then moving on."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当天早上，她没有下到觐见室，而是传唤军官们来花园。“征服者伊耿带给维斯特洛火与血，但同时也给予他们和平、繁荣和公正。我带给奴隶湾的只有死亡和毁灭。我像卡奥，不像女王，一番毁坏掠夺后，就拍屁股走人。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“您给弥林带来了自由。”弥桑黛指出。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"But how can I rule seven kingdoms if I cannot rule a single city?" He had no answer to that. Dany turned away from them, to gaze out over the city once again. "My children need time to heal and learn. My dragons need time to grow and test their wings. And I need the same. I will not let this city go the way of Astapor. I will not let the harpy of Yunkai chain up those I've freed all over again." She turned back to look at their faces. "I will not march."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“假如我连一座城市都无法管理，又怎能统治七大王国？”骑士无言以答。丹妮转身背对大家，再度凝望城市。“我的孩子们需要时间治疗和学习；我的龙需要时间成长试炼，以便早日高飞。我也一样。我不愿这座城市步上阿斯塔波的后尘，我不愿让渊凯的鹰身女妖重新奴役被我解放的人们。”她回身望向他们的脸。“我不会离开。”">查看中文翻译</div>
