<div class="line_en">There was another light in the room now, a thousand times brighter than the night-lights, and in the time we have taken to say this, it had been in all the drawers in the nursery, looking for Peter's shadow, rummaged the wardrobe and turned every pocket inside out. It was not really a light; it made this light by flashing about so quickly, but when it came to rest for a second you saw if was a fairy, no longer than your hand, but still growing. It was a girl called Tinker Bell exquisitely gowned in a skeleton leaf, cut low and square, through which her figure could be seen to the best advantage. She was slightly inclined to EMBONPOINT. (plump hourglass figure)</div>

<div class="line_en">For a moment after Mr. and Mrs. Darling left the house the night-lights by the beds of the three children continued to burn clearly. They were awfully nice little night-lights, and one cannot help wishing that they could have kept awake to see Peter; but Wendy's light blinked and gave such a yawn that the other two yawned also, and before they could close their mouths all the three went out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="达林先生和太太走了以后，有一会儿工夫，三个孩子床边的夜灯还是继续点得很明亮。那是三盏顶好顶好的小夜灯，我们巴不得它们都醒着看见彼得。可是温迪的灯眨了一下眼睛，打了一个大大的哈欠，惹得那两盏也打起哈欠来。嘴还没来得及闭上，三盏灯都灭了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The loveliest tinkle as of golden bells answered him. It is the fairy language. You ordinary children can never hear it, but if you were to hear it you would know that you had heard it once before.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一个最可爱的叮叮声，像金铃似的回答了他。这是仙子的语言，你们这些普通的孩子是从来听不到的；可是假如你听到了，你就会知道，你曾经听到过一次。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">If he thought at all, but I don't believe he ever thought, it was that he and his shadow, when brought near each other, would join like drops of water, and when they did not he was appalled. He tried to stick it on with soap from the bathroom, but that also failed. A shudder passed through Peter, and he sat on the floor and cried.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="假如他有思想的话——不过我相信他从来不思想——他会想，他和他的影子一挨近，就会像两滴水似的连在一起。可是，不料竟没有连在一起，这可把他吓坏了。他试着用浴室里的肥皂来粘，也失败了。彼得浑身打了一个冷战，坐在地板上哭了起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Tinker Bell," he called softly, after making sure that the children were asleep, "Tink, where are you?" She was in a jug for the moment, and liking it extremely; she had never been in a jug before.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他弄清楚孩子们确实睡着了之后，就轻轻地唤道：“叮叮铃，你在哪儿？”叮叮铃这时正在一只罐子里，这地方她喜欢极了，她从来没有在一只罐子里呆过。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Tink said that the shadow was in the big box. She meant the chest of drawers, and Peter jumped at the drawers, scattering their contents to the floor with both hands, as kings toss ha'pence to the crowd. In a moment he had recovered his shadow, and in his delight he forgot that he had shut Tinker Bell up in the drawer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="叮叮铃说，影子是在那只大箱子里，她指的是那只带抽屉的柜子。彼得一下蹦到抽屉跟前，双手捧起里面的东西，撒在地板上，就像国王把半便士的硬币抛向人群一般。不多会儿，他就找到了他的影子，他高兴极了，就忘了他把叮叮铃关在抽屉里了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Don't have a mother," he said. Not only had he no mother, but he had not the slightest desire to have one. He thought them very over-rated persons. Wendy, however, felt at once that she was in the presence of a tragedy.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“是的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“可你妈妈要收到信的吧？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I wasn't crying about mothers," he said rather indignantly. "I was crying because I can't get my shadow to stick on. Besides, I wasn't crying."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我哭，才不是因为妈妈，”彼得颇有点气愤地说，“我哭，是因为我没法把影子粘上。再说，我也没哭。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then Wendy saw the shadow on the floor, looking so draggled, and she was frightfully sorry for Peter. "How awful!" she said, but she could not help smiling when she saw that he had been trying to stick it on with soap. How exactly like a boy!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时候，温迪瞅见了地板上的影子，拖得挺脏的样子，她很替彼得难过。“真糟糕！”她说。可是，她看到彼得试看用肥皂去粘，又禁不住笑了起来。真是不折不扣像个小子干的事！">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“怕是要有点儿疼的。”她警告说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But she was exulting in his ignorance. "I shall sew it on for you, my little man," she said, though he was tall as herself, and she got out her housewife (sewing bag), and sewed the shadow on to Peter's foot.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，温迪喜欢他的正是笨。“我的小家伙，我来给你缝上。”她说，虽然彼得和她一样高。于是，她拿出针线盒来，把影子往彼得的脚上缝。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, I shan't cry," said Peter, who was already of the opinion that he had never cried in his life. And he clenched his teeth and did not cry, and soon his shadow was behaving properly, though still a little creased.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“啊，我一定不哭。”彼得说，他刚哭过，马上就以为他这辈子从来没哭过。他果然咬牙没哭。不一会儿，影子就弄妥了，不过还有点皱。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Perhaps I should have ironed it," Wendy said thoughtfully, but Peter, boylike, was indifferent to appearances, and he was now jumping about in the wildest glee. Alas, he had already forgotten that he owed his bliss to Wendy. He thought he had attached the shadow himself. "How clever I am!" he crowed rapturously, "oh, the cleverness of me!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“也许我应该把它熨熨平。”温迪考虑得很周到；可是，彼得就像个男孩一样，一点也不在乎外表，他这时欢喜得发狂，满屋子乱跳。他早已忘记，他的快乐是温迪赐给的。他以为影子是他自己粘上的。“我多聪明啊，”他开心地大叫，“啊，我多机灵啊！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It is humiliating to have to confess that this conceit of Peter was one of his most fascinating qualities. To put it with brutal frankness, there never was a cockier boy.</div>

<div class="line_en">"You did a little," Peter said carelessly, and continued to dance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你也干了一点点。”彼得漫不经心地说，继续跳着舞。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">To induce her to look up he pretended to be going away, and when this failed he sat on the end of the bed and tapped her gently with his foot. "Wendy," he said, "don't withdraw. I can't help crowing, Wendy, when I'm pleased with myself." Still she would not look up, though she was listening eagerly. "Wendy," he continued, in a voice that no woman has ever yet been able to resist, "Wendy, one girl is more use than twenty boys."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="彼得假装要离开的样子，来引温迪抬头，可是没用。于是他坐在床尾那头，用脚轻轻地踢她。“温迪，”他说，“别退出呀，温迪，我一高兴，就禁不住要翘尾巴。”温迪还是不抬头，虽然她是在认真地听着。“温迪，”彼得继续说，他说话的那种声调，是没有一个女孩子能抗拒的，“温迪，一个女孩比二十个男孩都顶用。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"A little!" she replied with hauteur (pride); "if I am no use I can at least withdraw," and she sprang in the most dignified way into bed and covered her face with the blankets.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你实在太可爱了，”温迪说，“我要再起来了。”于是她和彼得并排坐在床沿上。她还说，如果他愿意的话，她想给他一个吻；可是彼得不明白她的意思，就伸出手来，期待地等着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Now," said he, "shall I give you a kiss?" and she replied with a slight primness, "If you please." She made herself rather cheap by inclining her face toward him, but he merely dropped an acorn button into her hand, so she slowly returned her face to where it had been before, and said nicely that she would wear his kiss on the chain around her neck. It was lucky that she did put it on that chain, for it was afterwards to save her life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“现在，”彼得说，“要不要我也给你一个吻？”温迪回答，神情有点拘谨，“那就请吧。”她把脸颊向他凑过去，显得怪贱的。可是彼得只把一粒橡子放在她手里；于是温迪又把脸慢慢地退回原处，并且亲切地说，她要把他的吻拴在项链上，戴在脖子上。幸好，她果真把橡子挂在了项链上，因为后来，这东西救了她的命。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I don't know," he replied uneasily, "but I am quite young." He really knew nothing about it, he had merely suspicions, but he said at a venture, "Wendy, I ran away the day I was born."</div>

<div class="line_en">When people in our set are introduced, it is customary for them to ask each other's age, and so Wendy, who always liked to do the correct thing, asked Peter how old he was.

<div class="line_cn" title="“现在没事儿了，”约翰从藏着的地方出来宣布说，“我说彼得，你真能飞吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Peter did it both slowly and quickly. "I've got it now, Wendy!" cried John, but soon he found he had not. Not one of them could fly an inch, though even Michael was in words of two syllables, and Peter did not know A from Z.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="彼得慢的快的都做了一次。“我学会了，温迪！”约翰喊道，可是他马上就明白，他并没有学会。他们三个，没有一个能飞一寸远，虽然就识字来说，就连迈克尔也能认两个音节的字，彼得却一个字母也不认得。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Instead of troubling to answer him Peter flew around the room, taking the mantelpiece on the way.</div>

<div class="line_en">They were not nearly so elegant as Peter, they could not help kicking a little, but their heads were bobbing against the ceiling, and there is almost nothing so delicious as that. Peter gave Wendy a hand at first, but had to desist, Tink was so indignant.</div>
