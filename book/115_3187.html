<div class="line_en">I had never realized, of course, that life at Manderley would be so orderly and planned. I remember now, looking back, how on that first morning Maxim was up and dressed and writing letters, even before breakfast, and when I got downstairs, rather after nine o'clock, a little flurried by the booming summons of the gong, I found he had nearly finished, he was already peeling his fruit.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当然，我从没想到，在曼陀丽的生活竟是如此有条不紊，这样刻板！今天回忆起来，我还记得第一天早晨的情景：迈克西姆很早起身，早饭之前就穿着停当，开始写信。九点过后好大一会儿，我才应着镗镗的小锣声，慌忙下楼。这时他已快吃完早餐，在削着水果了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He looked up at me and smiled. "You mustn't mind," he said; "this is something you will have to get used to. I've no time to hang about at this hour of the day. Running a place like Manderley, you know, is a full-time job. The coffee and the hot dishes are on the sideboard. We always help ourselves at breakfast." I said something about my clock being slow, about having been too long in the bath, but he did not listen, he was looking down at a letter, frowning at something.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他抬起头来朝我笑笑说：“你别介意，这一套你总得设法适应才好。每天这个时候我是没有空闲的。你知道，管理曼陀丽这么一所大宅，非得把全部时间花上去不可。咖啡和热菜都在餐具柜上。早餐的时候我们不用仆人服侍。”我告诉他，我的钟慢了，另外洗澡多花了点时间，可他根本没听，他低着头读一封信，不知为什么皱着眉头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">How impressed I was, I remember well; impressed and a little overawed by the magnificence of the breakfast offered to us. There was tea, in a great silver urn, and coffee too, and on the heater, piping hot, dishes of scrambled eggs, of bacon, and another of fish. There was a little clutch of boiled eggs as well, in their own special heater, and porridge, in a silver porringer. On another sideboard was a ham, and a great piece of cold bacon. There were scones too, on the table, and toast, and various pots of jam, marmalade, and honey, while dessert dishes, piled high with fruit, stood at either end. It seemed strange to me that Maxim, who in Italy and France had eaten a croissant and fruit only, and drunk a cup of coffee, should sit down to this breakfast at home, enough for a dozen people, day after day probably, year after year, seeing nothing ridiculous about it, nothing wasteful.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我还清楚地记得，早餐的丰盛给我留下深刻的印象，甚至使我有点惶然不知所措。在一只银质大壶里盛着热茶，还有咖啡；炒蛋和腊肠在炉子上咝咝冒着热气，另一道热菜是鱼；在另一只特制的炉子上搁着几枚一窝生的煮鸡蛋；在一只银碗里盛着麦片粥；在另一个餐具柜上放着火腿和一方冻腊肠；而在餐桌上刚摆开了面包、吐司，各种各样的果酱和蜂蜜罐。两端是堆得高高的水果盘。我觉得很奇怪，在意大利和法国的时候迈克西姆早饭只吃一客夹心面包卷和水果，只喝一杯咖啡，回家来却摆开这么丰盛的早餐，够一打人吃的了。日复一日，年复一年，也许他对此习以为常，根本不觉得是什么浪费。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes, according to the letter I got this morning. She won't stay long. You'll like her, I think. She's very direct, believes in speaking her mind. No humbug at all. If she doesn't like you she'll tell you so, to your face."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的。早晨接到她的信，说是今天就来。可她不会在这儿果很久。我想你一定会喜欢她的。这人很直率，想什么就说什么，决不是那种虚伪的角色。她如果对你没有什么好感，就会当着你的面说出来。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Thank the Lord I haven't a great crowd of relations to inflict upon you," said Maxim, "a sister I very rarely see, and a grandmother who is nearly blind. Beatrice, by the way, asks herself over to lunch. I half expected she would. I suppose she wants to have a look at you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“感谢上帝，幸好我的亲戚不多，不会来多麻烦你，”迈克西姆说。“我只有一个难得见面的姐姐，一个差不多瞎了眼的老奶奶。顺便说一声，我姐姐比阿特丽斯不遂自来，说要来吃顿中饭。我料到她会来的。她大概想见见你。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I noticed he had eaten a small piece of fish. I took a boiled egg. And I wondered what happened to the rest, all those scrambled eggs, that crisp bacon, the porridge, the remains of the fish.

"I'd like to have taken you round the garden, but I must see Crawley, my agent. I've been away from things too long. He'll be in to lunch, too, by the way. You don't mind, do you? You will be all right?"</div>

<div class="line_en">I lingered long over my first breakfast, spinning out the time, and it was not until I saw Frith come in and look at me, from behind the service screen, that I realized it was after ten o'clock. I sprang to my feet at once, feeling guilty, and apologized for sitting there so late, and he bowed, saying nothing, very polite, very correct, and I caught a flicker of surprise in his eyes. I wondered if I had said the wrong thing. Perhaps it did not do to apologize. Perhaps it lowered me in his estimation. I wished I knew what to say, what to do. I wondered if he suspected, as Mrs Danvers had done, that poise, and grace, and assurance were not qualities inbred in me, but were things to be acquired, painfully perhaps, and slowly, costing me many bitter moments.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这第一顿早饭我吃了好久，故意挨时间，直到弗里思进来，在侍者帷幕后边朝我张望，我才意识到这时已经十点多钟。我顿时跳了起来，觉得很内疚，并为自己在餐桌旁坐得太久说了几句表示歉意的话。弗里思一躬到地，一言不发，他总是这样有礼貌，言行的分寸恰到好处。可是，在他眼睛里我却捕捉到了一闪而过的惊奇的神色。难道我方才这些话又说错了？也许我根本不该道歉。这样一来反而降低了我在他眼中的地位。我多么希望自己能够掌握分寸，知道当时当地应该说什么，做什么。看来弗里思也像丹弗斯太太一样，在怀疑我的身分；他也看出，态度自如、举止优雅而有自信，这些决不是我的素质。而是我要花好长时间，也许得经过痛苦的磨炼才得以学到的东西，而要学会这一套，我得屡受煎熬，付出代价。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then he picked up his letters, and went out of the room, and I remember thinking this was not how I imagined my first morning; I had seen us walking together, arms linked, to the sea, coming back rather late and tired and happy to a cold lunch, alone, and sitting afterwards under that chestnut tree I could see from the library window.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他捡起信件，走出房去。我记得当时自己很失望，因为在我原先的想象中，第一天的早晨我们应该手挽手到海边去散步，一直玩到人乏兴尽才回来。因为回来得迟，午饭已冷了，我们就在一起单独进餐。吃过午饭。我俩坐在藏书室窗外那棵栗子树下憩息。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="事实也的确如此。当我埋着头走出房间时，我在门边的阶梯上绊了一下，弗里思跑来搀我，替我拾起掉在地上的手绢，而那名叫罗伯特的年轻跟班，站在帷幕背后，忙不迭扭过脸去，以免让我看到他在窃笑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They looked at me in surprise. I quickly went out again. It could not be right, then, for me to go to my room at that hour in the morning. It was not expected of me. It broke the household routine. I crept downstairs once more, silently, thankful of my slippers that made no sound on the stone flags, and so into the library, which was chilly, the windows flung wide open, the fire laid but not lit.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两人惊愕地望着我。我赶快返了出来。原来我又错了，早晨这个时候不该到卧室去，谁都没想到我会冒冒失失间去，我刚才的举动违反了曼陀丽的日常惯例。我只得轻手轻脚再次下楼，幸好穿着拖鞋，走在石板上倒没有什么声响。我走进藏书室，里面窗户大开，壁炉里柴火已经堆好，但没有点着，因此寒气逼人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I shut the windows, and looked round for a box of matches. I could not find one. I wondered what I should do. I did not like to ring. But the library, so snug and warm last night with the burning logs, was like an ice-house now, in the early morning. There were matches upstairs in the bedroom, but I did not like to go for them because it would mean disturbing the housemaids at their work. I could not bear their moon faces staring at me again. I decided that when Frith and Robert had left the dining-room I would fetch the matches from the sideboard. I tiptoed out into the hall and listened. They were still clearing, I could hear the sound of voices, and the movement of trays.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我关上窗子，四下环顾着想找一盒火柴，可是找来找去没找着，一时不知道该怎么办。我不愿按铃叫人。可是昨晚上炉火熊熊、舒适而温暖的藏书室，此刻简直像座冰窖。楼上卧室里肯定有火柴，但我不愿再去打扰使女们干活，她们的圆脸蛋一个劲儿盯着我瞧，使我受不了。我决定等弗里思和罗伯特两人离开餐厅后，到餐具柜上去取火柴，于是就蹑手蹑脚走进大厅，听那边的动静。他们还在收拾，我听到他们在说话；还有托盘相碰的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I heard the murmur of their voices as I crossed the hall, and one of them laughed -- Robert, I supposed. Perhaps they were laughing about me. I went upstairs again, to the privacy of my bedroom, but when I opened the door I found the housemaids in there doing the room; one was sweeping the floor, the other dusting the dressing-table.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当我穿过大厅时，我还听到两人在小声说话，其中一个，大概又是罗伯特，笑了一声。两人大概正在笑话我。我回到楼上，想独个儿关在卧室里安静一会。可是一推开门，我发现使女们正在打扫房间，一个扫地，另一个抹梳妆台。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Presently all was silent, they must have gone through the service doors into the kitchen quarters, so I went across the hall and into the dining-room once more. Yes, there was a box of matches on the sideboard, as I expected. I crossed the room quickly and picked them up, and as I did so Frith came back into the room. I tried to cram the box furtively into my pocket, but I saw him glance at my hand in surprise.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不大一会儿，一切都安静下来，两人一定是从侍者专用门走进，往厨房方向去了。我穿过大厅，再次走进餐厅。果然，餐具柜上有一盒火柴，我疾步穿过房间，一把抓起火柴。可正在这时，弗里思又回来了。我偷偷摸摸把火柴盒往袋子里塞，但为时已晚，我看到他惊诧地朝我的手掌膘了一眼。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“太太，藏书室里通常是下午才生火。德温特夫人总是使用晨室的，所以此刻展室里已生了火。当然，要是您吩咐在藏书室里也生火，我马上叫人照办。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“您如果需要信纸、笔和墨水，那儿都有，太太，”他说。“过去，德温特夫人在早餐后总在那儿写信，打电话，如果您对丹弗斯太太有什么吩咐，家里的内线电话也在那里。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I turned away into the hall again, humming a little tune to give me an air of confidence. I could not tell him that I had never seen the morning-room, that Maxim had not shown it to me the night before. I knew he was standing in the entrance to the dining-room, watching me, as I went across the hall, and that I must make some show of knowing my way. There was a door to the left of the great staircase, and I went recklessly towards it, praying in my heart that it would take me to my goal, but when I came to it and opened it I saw that it was a garden room, a place for odds and ends: there was a table where flowers were done, there were basket chairs stacked against the wall, and a couple of mackintoshes too, hanging on a peg. I came out, a little defiantly, glancing across the hall, and saw Frith still standing there. I had not deceived him, though, not for a moment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我转身走进大厅，嘴里哼着一支小调，以此来给自己壮胆。我自然不能对他说，我还没到过晨室，前一夜迈克西姆没领我去看过那房问。我知道他正站在餐厅的入口处，看我穿过大厅，所以我一定得装出一种熟谙门路的样子。在大楼梯的左首有一扇门，我鲁莽地朝它走去，一边暗暗祈祷，但愿自己没有走错。可是一推开门，我发现这是一间园艺贮藏室，里面堆着杂七杂八的零碎东西：一张桌子是专供修剪鲜花用的；好些柳条椅堆在墙边；钉子上挂着两三件胶布雨衣。我装出一种目中无人的样子退了回来，朝大厅那头瞥一眼，看见弗里思还站在那里。这么说，我的一举一动都没能逃过他的眼睛。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I went through the long drawing-room, as he had directed; a lovely room this, beautifully proportioned, looking out upon the lawns down to the sea. The public would see this room, I supposed, and Frith, if he showed them round, would know the history of the pictures on the wall, and the period of the furniture. It was beautiful of course, I knew that, and those chairs and tables probably without price, but for all that I had no wish to linger there; I could not see myself sitting ever in those chairs, standing before that carved mantelpiece, throwing books down on to the tables. It had all the formality of a room in a museum, where alcoves were roped off, and a guardian, in cloak and hat like the guides in the French chateaux, sat in a chair beside the door. I went through then, and turned to the left, and so on to the little morning-room I had not seen before.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我按着他的指点，穿过大客厅。这是间很美的屋子，比例对称，外边是草坪，草坪倾斜着通向海滩。我想这儿大概是接纳公众参观的，要是由弗里思来导游讲解，他一定熟知墙上每一幅绘画的历史，熟知房内每一件家具的制作年代。的确，房间很美，这点我也看得出来，这些桌椅可能都是无价之宝，尽管如此，我可不愿在这儿逗留，我怎么也不能设想自己会坐在这样的椅子里，或是站在这精雕细刻的炉边，把手里的书撂在旁边的桌上。房间肃穆得犹如博物馆的陈列室。在那种陈列室里，壁龛前拉着绳子，门口椅子上还坐着身穿大氅、头戴宽边帽的看守人，活像法国城堡的卫兵。我赶快穿过客厅，向左转弯，终于来到这间我还没有见过的晨室。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Somehow I guessed, before going to the window, that the room looked out upon the rhododendrons. Yes, there they were, blood-red and luscious, as I had seen them the evening before, great bushes of them, massed beneath the open window, encroaching on to the sweep of the drive itself. There was a little clearing too, between the bushes, like a miniature lawn, the grass a smooth carpet of moss, and in the centre of this, the tiny statue of a naked faun, his pipes to his lips.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不知什么缘故，我还没走到窗口就猜到，房间外面一定是石南花丛。果然，在打开的窗子底下聚集着大簇大簇鲜血一般红得过分的石南，就是昨天傍晚我见到过的那些花。它们已经蔓延着侵入车道。花丛中间有一小片草地，那是平整得像地毯一样的苦鲜。草地中央立着一座小小的雕像，那是一个吹着风笛的森林之神。塑像以猩红色的石南花为背景，而小草地则如同戏台，任他在这儿起舞表演。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I was glad to see the dogs there, sitting before the fire, and Jasper, the younger, came over to me at once, his tail wagging, and thrust his nose into my hand. The old one lifted her muzzle at my approach, and gazed in my direction with her blind eyes, but when she had sniffed the air a moment, and found I was not the one she sought, she turned her head away with a grunt, and looked steadily into the fire again. Then Jasper left me, too, and settled himself by the side of his companion, licking his side. This was their routine. They knew, even as Frith had known, that the library fire was not lit until the afternoon. They came to the morning-room from long custom.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="看到两条狗已蹲在炉火前，我心里才好过些。小狗杰斯珀立刻摇着尾巴朝我奔来，把鼻子伸到我手里，那条老母狗听到我走过来，只是抬了抬鼻子，用瞎眼朝着我进门的方向。它用鼻子嗅了一阵，发觉我不是它等待的那个人，于是就咕噜了一声，把头转开，又盯着炉火出神去了。接着，杰斯珀也撇下我，跑到老狗旁边安顿下来，舔着自己的身子，它们像弗里思一样，都知道藏书室在下午以前不生火，因此，很久以来就养成了跑到晨室来度过早上这段时间的习惯。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The crimson rhododendrons made his background, and the clearing itself was like a little stage, where he would dance, and play his part. There was no musty smell about this room, as there had been in the library. There were no old well-worn chairs, no tables littered with magazines and papers, seldom if ever read, but left there from long custom, because Maxim's father, or even his grandfather perhaps, had wished it so.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个房间不同于藏书室，没有那种霉味儿。这里没有那些年长月久被坐得陈旧了的椅子，没有摊满书报的桌子。藏书室里摊着许多书报，其实并没有人读这些东西，只是老习惯罢了，迈克西姆的父亲，或许甚至是他的老祖父，喜欢这样摆摆样子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This was a woman's room, graceful, fragile, the room of someone who had chosen every particle of furniture with great care, so that each chair, each vase, each small, infinitesimal thing should be in harmony with one another, and with her own personality. It was as though she who had arranged this room had said: "This I will have, and this, and this," taking piece by piece from the treasures in Manderley each object that pleased her best, ignoring the second-rate, the mediocre, laying her hand with sure certain instinct only upon the best. There was no intermingling of style, no confusing of period, and the result was perfection in a strange and startling way, not coldly formal like the drawing-room shown to the public, but vividly alive, having something of the same glow and brilliance that the rhododendrons had, massed there, beneath the window. And I noticed then that the rhododendrons, not content with forming their theatre on the little lawn outside the window, had been permitted to the room itself. Their great warm faces looked down upon me from the mantelpiece, they floated in a bowl upon the table by the sofa, they stood, lean and graceful, on the writing-desk beside the golden candlesticks.</div>

<div class="line_en">The room was filled with them, even the walls took colour from them, becoming rich and glowing in the morning sun. They were the only flowers in the room, and I wondered if there was some purpose in it, whether the room had been arranged originally with this one end in view, for nowhere else in the house did the rhododendrons obtrude. There were flowers in the dining-room, flowers in the library, but orderly and trim, rather in the background, not like this, not in profusion. I went and sat down at the writing-desk, and I thought how strange it was that this room, so lovely and so rich in colour, should be, at the same time, so business-like and purposeful. Somehow I should have expected that a room furnished as this was in such exquisite taste, for all the exaggeration of the flowers, would be a place of decoration only, languorous and intimate.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="房间里到处是石南花，连墙壁也染上了血红色，在早上的阳光中浓艳得耀眼。石南是房间里唯一的鲜花，我怀疑这是不是一种有意的安排，这屋子陈设布置成这个样子，也许本来就是仅仅为了摆石南花的吧？不然的话为什么其他房间里都不摆石南花？餐厅的藏书室里也放鲜花，但都修剪得整整齐齐，搁在适当的地位作为陪衬，不像这儿的石南花那么多。我走过去，在写字桌边坐下。使我惊奇的是这个彩色缤纷的精美的房间同时竟也专作办事的地方使用。我本以为，用这样高雅的趣味打扮起来的房间，尽管鲜花多得过分，只不过是一个用来显示装饰美，供人在倦慵时私下休息的去处。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But this writing-table, beautiful as it was, was no pretty toy where a woman would scribble little notes, nibbling the end of a pen, leaving it, day after day, in carelessness, the blotter a little askew. The pigeon-holes were docketed, "letters unanswered", "letters-to-keep", "household", "estate", "menus", "miscellaneous", "addresses"; each ticket written in that same scrawling pointed hand that I knew already. And it shocked me, even startled me, to recognize it again, for I had not seen it since I had destroyed the page from the book of poems, and I had not thought to see it again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是这张写字桌，纵然纤巧精致，却决不是女人的小玩意儿，由你坐在旁边，咬着笔杆，信手写就短柬便条，然后把吸墨纸台歪歪斜斜地一丢，接着漫不经心地走开。写字桌上设有鸽笼式的文件架，上边贴着“待复信件”、“须保存信件””、“家务”、“田庄”、“菜单”、“杂项”、“通讯地址”等标签。标签是用一手我已熟悉的尖细的草体字写成的。一下子认出这笔迹，简直把我吓了一跳，因为自从把诗集的扉页销毁之后，我还没再见过这笔迹。另外，我也没有想到还会见到它。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I opened a drawer at hazard, and there was the writing once more, this time in an open leather book, whose heading "Guests at Manderley" showed at once, divided into weeks and months, what visitors had come and gone, the rooms they had used, the food they had eaten. I turned over the pages and saw that the book was a complete record of a year, so that the hostess, glancing back, would know to the day, almost to the hour, what guest had passed what night under her roof, and where he had slept, and what she had given him to eat. There was notepaper also in the drawer, thick white sheets, for rough writing, and the notepaper of the house, with the crest, and the address, and visiting cards, ivory white, in little boxes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我胡乱地拉开一只抽屉，一眼又看见她的笔迹。这回是出现在一本打开的皮封面记事册上，册子的标题是《曼陀丽宾客录》，内容按星期和月份编排，上面记录着来往宾客姓名，他们住过的房间以及他们的伙食。我一页一页翻着，发现册子上记载了整整一年中曼陀丽来往宾客的情况。这样，女主人只需打开册子一看，就知道到今天，甚至到此刻为止，哪一天有哪位客人在她家过夜。来客宿在哪一个房间，女主人为他准备什么样的饭菜。抽屉里还有些雪白的硬信纸，是专供落笔很重的人草书用的，此外还有印着纹章和地址的家用信笺，以及盛在小盒子里的雪白的名片。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I took one out and looked at it, unwrapped it from its thin tissue of paper. "Mrs M. de Winter" it said, and in the corner "Manderley". I put it back in the box again, and shut the drawer, feeling guilty suddenly, and deceitful, as though I were staying in somebody else's house and my hostess had said to me, "Yes, of course, write letters at my desk," and I had unforgivably, in a stealthy manner, peeped at her correspondence. At any moment she might come back into the room and she would see me there, sitting before her open drawer, which I had no right to touch.</div>

<div class="line_en">And when the telephone rang, suddenly, alarmingly, on the desk in front of me, my heart leapt and I started up in terror, thinking I had been discovered. I took the receiver off with trembling hands, and "Who is it?" I said, "who do you want?" There was a strange buzzing at the end of the line, and then a voice came, low and rather harsh, whether that of a woman or a man I could not tell, and "Mrs de Winter?" it said, "Mrs de Winter?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然间，面前写字桌上的电话铃声大作，把我吓得一下子跳了起来，以为这F被人逮住了。我双手颤抖着拿起话筒，问道：“哪一位？您找谁？”线路那头传来一阵陌生的嘤嘤声，接着就响起一个低沉粗鲁的嗓音：“是德温特夫人吗？”我听不出说话的是男人还是女人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm afraid you have made a mistake," I said; "Mrs de Winter has been dead for over a year." I sat there, waiting, staring stupidly into the mouthpiece, and it was not until the name was repeated again, the voice incredulous, slightly raised, that I became aware, with a rush of colour to my face, that I had blundered irretrievably, and could not take back my words. "It's Mrs Danvers, Madam," said the voice. "I'm speaking to you on the house telephone." My faux pas was so palpably obvious, so idiotic and unpardonable, that to ignore it would show me to be an even greater fool, if possible, than I was already.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“恐怕您弄错了吧，”我说。“德温特夫人过世已经一年多了。”我坐在位子上，默默地望着话筒，等候对方回话。直到对方用大惑不解的语气，稍微提高嗓门，再问一遍名字，我才意识到自己说漏了嘴，犯了个不可挽回的错误，于是蓦地涨红了脸。对方在电话里说：“太太，我是丹弗斯太太，我是在内线电话上跟您说话。”我方才失常的表现实在无法掩饰，愚蠢得太不像话，要是不对此有所表示那只会使自己进一步出丑，尽管方才的洋相已出得相当可以了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Thank you, Mrs Danvers," I said. I listened for a moment, but she said no more, and then I heard a little click at the end of the telephone, which meant she had replaced the receiver. I did the same. Then I looked down again at the desk, and the notepaper, ready for use, upon the blotter. In front of me stared the ticketed pigeon-holes, and the words upon them "letters unanswered", "estate", "miscellaneous", were like a reproach to me for my idleness. She who sat here before me had not wasted her time, as I was doing. She had reached out for the house telephone and given her orders for the day, swiftly, efficiently, and run her pencil perhaps through an item in the menu that had not pleased her. She had not said "Yes, Mrs Danvers," and "Of course, Mrs Danvers," as I had done. And then, when she had finished, she began her letters, five, six, seven perhaps to be answered, all written in that same curious, slanting hand I knew so well. She would tear off sheet after sheet of that smooth white paper, using it extravagantly, because of the long strokes she made when she wrote, and at the end of each of her personal letters she put her signature, "Rebecca", that tall sloping R dwarfing its fellows.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“谢谢你，丹弗斯太太。”说完之后，我手持听筒等着，可她没再说什么。听到对方滴铃一声挂断电话，我才放下听筒。我的眼光又转向写字桌，望着那些随时备用的信纸和吸墨纸台。我面前的鸽笼式文件架好像在盯着我看，那些上边写着“待复信件”、“田庄”、“杂项”等字样的标签都在责备我为什么闲坐着无所事事。以前曾坐在我这个位子上的女人可不像我这样浪费时间，她伸手抓起内线电话的听筒，干脆利落、斩钉截铁地发号施令，菜单上要是有哪一项不合她的意，她就提笔勾掉。她可不像我这样只会说：“行啊，丹弗斯太太”，“当然啦，丹弗斯太太”。等打完电话，她开始写信，五封，六封，七封，写个没完，用的就是那手我已熟悉的不同寻常的斜体字。她一张一张撕下光滑的白信纸。在每封私人信件底下，她签上自己的名字：吕蓓卡。那个倾斜的R字母特别高大，相形之下，其他字母都显得十分矮小。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I drummed with my fingers on the desk. The pigeon-holes were empty now. There were no "letters unanswered" waiting to be dealt with, no bills to pay that I knew anything about. If I had anything urgent, Mrs Danvers said, I must telephone through to Robert and he would give orders for it to be taken to the post. I wondered how many urgent letters Rebecca used to write, and who they were written to. Dressmakers perhaps -- "I must have the white satin on Tuesday, without fail," or to her hairdresser -- "I shall be coming up next Friday, and want an appointment at three o'clock with Monsieur Antoine himself. Shampoo, massage, set, and manicure." No, letters of that type would be a waste of time. She would have a call put through to London. Frith would do it.
