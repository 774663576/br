<div class="line_en">Adept as she was, in all the arts of cunning and dissimulation, the girl Nancy could not wholly conceal the effect which the knowledge of the step she had taken, wrought upon her mind. She remembered that both the crafty Jew and the brutal Sikes had confided to her schemes, which had been hidden from all others: in the full confidence that she was trustworthy and beyond the reach of their suspicion. Vile as those schemes were, desperate as were their originators, and bitter as were her feelings towards Fagin, who had led her, step by step, deeper and deeper down into an abyss of crime and misery, whence was no escape; still, there were times when, even towards him, she felt some relenting, lest her disclosure should bring him within the iron grasp he had so long eluded, and he should fall at last -- richly as he merited such a fate -- by her hand.</div>

<div class="line_en">But, these were the mere wanderings of a mind unable wholly to detach itself from old companions and associations, though enabled to fix itself steadily on one object, and resolved not to be turned aside by any consideration. Her fears for Sikes would have been more powerful inducements to recoil while there was yet time; but she had stipulated that her secret should be rigidly kept, she had dropped no clue which could lead to his discovery, she had refused, even for his sake, a refuge from all the guilt and wretchedness that encompasses her -- and what more could she do! She was resolved.</div>

<div class="line_en">Though all her mental struggles terminated in this conclusion, they forced themselves upon her, again and again, and left their traces too. She grew pale and thin, even within a few days. At times, she took no heed of what was passing before her, or no part in conversations where once, she would have been the loudest. At other times, she laughed without merriment, and was noisy without a moment afterwards -- she sat silent and dejected, brooding with her head upon her hands, while the very effort by which she roused herself, told, more forcibly than even these indications, that she was ill at ease, and that her thoughts were occupied with matters very different and distant from those in the course of discussion by her companions.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尽管内心的斗争都以这样的结果告终，但它们依然一次又一次向她袭来，并且在她身上留下了痕迹。不出几天，她就变得苍白而又消瘦。她时常对面前发生的事毫不理会，或者根本不介人众人的谈话云：“仁者不忧，知者不惑，勇者不惧。”《中庸》指出：“好，而过去她在这类谈话中嗓门比谁都大。有的时候，她干巴巴地发出一阵笑声，无缘无故或者说毫无意义地大闹一通。可往往刹那之间，她又无精精打采地坐了下来，手支着脑袋沉思默想。她有时也想尽力振作起来，但这种努力甚至比这些征兆更能说明她心神不定，她所想的和同伴们正在商量的根本不是一回事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was Sunday night, and the bell of the nearest church struck the hour. Sikes and the Jew were talking, but they paused to listen. The girl looked up from the low seat on which she crouched, and listened too. Eleven.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“那你休想出去。”赛克斯一口拒绝，站起来锁上房门，抽出钥匙，又扯下她头上的软帽，扔到一只旧衣柜顶上。“行了，”那强盗说，“眼下就安安静静呆在老地方吧，好不好？”">查看中文翻译</div>

Sikes looked on, for a minute, watching his opportunity, and suddenly pinioning her hands dragged her, struggling and wrestling with him by the way, into a small room adjoining, where he sat himself on a bench, and thrusting her into a chair, held her down by force. She struggled and implored by turns until twelve o'clock had struck, and then, wearied and exhausted, ceased to contest the point any further. With a caution, backed by many oaths, to make no more efforts to go out that night, Sikes left her to recover at leisure and rejoined Fagin.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“除非你让我出去――除非你让我出去――就不起来――就不起来！”姑娘尖叫着。赛克斯看了一会儿，瞅准机会突然扼住她的双手，任凭她挣扎扭打，把她拖进隔壁小屋，推到一把椅子上，用力按住，自己在一张长凳上坐下来。她轮番挣扎，哀求，直到钟敲十二点，她折腾得筋疲力尽，这才不再坚持原来的要求。赛克斯警告了一声，又加了一通诅咒，要她当晚别再打算出去，便扔下她去慢慢缓过劲来，自己回到费金那儿。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No matter just now. We'll talk of this again. You have a friend in me, Nance; a staunch friend. I have the means at hand, quiet and close. If you want revenge on those that treat you like a dog -- like a dog! worse than his dog, for he humours him sometimes -- come to me. I say, come to me. He is the mere hound of a day, but you know me of old, Nance."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“眼下不提了，”老犹太说道，“我们以后再商量。你可以把我当朋友，南希，一个可靠的朋友。我手头有的是办法，又稳当又秘密。你要是想报仇，就是为他把你和狗一样看待的那些事报仇――和狗一样！连他的狗都不如，他有时候还同狗闹着玩呢――你来找我好了。我是说，你尽管来找我。他跟你交往日子不长，你我可是老朋友了，南希。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well?" said the girl, as Fagin paused, with his mouth almost touching her ear, and his eyes looking into hers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦！”姑娘叫了一声，费金骤然打住，嘴巴差一点没碰着她的耳朵，双眼逼视着她的眼睛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Fagin walked towards his home, intent upon the thoughts that were working within his brain. He had conceived the idea -- not from what had just passed though that had tended to confirm him, but slowly and by degrees -- that Nancy, wearied of the housebreaker's brutality, had conceived an attachment for some new friend. Her altered manner, her repeated absences from home alone, her comparative indifference to the interests of the gang for which she had once been so zealous, and, added to these, her desperate impatience to leave home that night at a particular hour, all favoured the supposition, and rendered it, to him at least, almost matter of certainty. The object of this new liking was not among his myrmidons. He would be a valuable acquisition with such an assistant as Nancy, and must (thus Fagin argued) be secured without delay.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="费金朝自己的住处走去，一门心思全用在脑子里那些进进出出的鬼点子上头。他已经看出――这个念头是缓慢地一步一步形成的，而不是根据刚才的一幕，尽管这事为他提供了佐证――南希不堪忍受那个强盗的粗暴对待，打算另寻新欢。她近来神色大变，常常单独外出，以前她对团伙的利益那样热心，现在似乎变得相当冷漠，加上她不顾死活，急着要在当晚一个特定的时间出门，凡此种种都有助于证实这个推测，至少在他看来，这几乎成了十拿九稳的事。她新结识的那位相好不在他那班忠心耿耿的部下当中。加上南希这样一个帮手，此人完全可能成为一株非常宝贵的摇钱树，必须（费金如此这般地论证着）毫不拖延地弄到手。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She shrank back, as Fagin offered to lay his hand on hers, but said good-night again, in a steady voice, and, answering his parting look with a nod of intelligence, closed the door between them.</div>

<div class="line_en">"With a little persuasion," thought Fagin, "what more likely than that she would consent to poison him? Women have done such things, and worse, to secure the same object before now. There would be the dangerous villain: the man I hate: gone; another secured in his place; and my influence over the girl, with a knowledge of this crime to back it, unlimited."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“只要劝说一番，”费金思忖道，“她会不答应给他下点毒药？为了达到相同的目的，以前就有娘们干过这种事，甚至比这更辣手的也有。活该这个危险的家伙完蛋了，我讨厌这家伙，以后他的位置会有人来填的。那姑娘干了杀人勾当，把柄攥在我手里，往后怎么摆布她还不得由着我。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was another, and a darker object, to be gained. Sikes knew too much, and his ruffian taunts had not galled Fagin the less, because the wounds were hidden. The girl must know, well, that if she shook him off, she could never be safe from his fury, and that it would be surely wreaked -- to the maiming of limbs, or perhaps the loss of life -- on the object of her more recent fancy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="还有一个目的，一个更为阴险的目的必须达到。赛克斯知道的事太多了，他那些恶言冷语给费金造成的伤害虽然看不见，但产生的刻骨仇恨并没有因此而减轻。那姑娘必须懂得，就是说，即使能够把赛克斯给甩了，她也绝对躲不过他的疯狂报复，这口气肯定会出在她最近认识的相好头上――弄个肢体残废，没准儿还得送命。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">These things passed through the mind of Fagin, during the short time he sat alone, in the housebreaker's room; and with them uppermost in his thoughts, he had taken the opportunity afterwards afforded him, of sounding the girl in the broken hints he threw out at parting. There was no expression of surprise, no assumption of an inability to understand his meaning. The girl clearly comprehended it. Her glance at parting showed that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="费金刚才独自坐在那个强盗的房间里，在那个短暂的间隔，这些事情从他脑海里掠过。他对这些事看得很重，临走的时候又趁机用一些断断续续的暗示向南希试探过了，那姑娘没有一点惊奇的表情，也没有佯装不懂他的意思。姑娘显然已经心领神会，这从她临别的眼神看得出来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Such brains are fertile in expedients. If, without extracting a confession from herself, he laid a watch, discovered the object of her altered regard, and threatened to reveal the whole history to Sikes (of whom she stood in no common fear) unless she entered into his designs, could he not secure her compliance?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这样的脑袋瓜真可以称得上足智多谋。就算不逼她自己说出来，他也可以设一个暗探，找到她刚换的心上人，然后扬言要把这事统统告诉赛克斯（她对赛克斯怕得不得了），除非她参与自己的计划，还愁她不答应？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I can," said Fagin, almost aloud. "She durst not refuse me then. Not for her life, not for her life! I have it all. The means are ready, and shall be set to work. I shall have you yet!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我有办法，”费金险些儿高声说了出来，“到时候她不敢不由着我，又不是要她的命，又不是要她的命。我有绝对的把握。办法都是现成的，立马就可以见效。你反正逃不出我的手心。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But perhaps she would recoil from a plot to take the life of Sikes, and that was one of the chief ends to be attained. "How," thought Fagin, as he crept homeward, "can I increase my influence with her? What new power can I acquire?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是，一个谋害赛克斯性命的计划也许会把她吓得缩回去，而这正是必须达到的主要目的之一。“我怎么才能增加对她的影响呢？”费金蹑手蹑脚地往家里走，一路都在盘算。“怎么才能再加一把力？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He cast back a dark look, and a threatening motion of the hand, towards the spot where he had left the bolder villain; and went on his way: busying his bony hands in the folds of his tattered garment, which he wrenched tightly in his grasp, as though there were a hated enemy crushed with every motion of his fingers.</div>
