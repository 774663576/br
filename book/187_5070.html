<div class="line_en">For one second all the Dwarfs were staring at Puzzle with wide open mouths and then one of the soldiers said sharply, "Are you mad, My Master? What are you doing to the slaves?" and the other said, "And who are you?" Neither of their spears was at the salute now -- both were down and ready for action.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="片刻之间，所有的小矮人都张大着嘴巴，瞪着眼睛打量那驴子，这时有个士兵机警地说道：“我的长官，你疯了吗？你在对奴隶们说些什么话呀？”另一个士兵说：“你究竟是什么人？”现在不是高举长矛敬礼了——而是两支长矛都放下来准备战斗了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">What the Dwarfs saw, now that they could see it close, was certainly enough to make them wonder how they had ever been taken in. The lion-skin had got pretty untidy already during Puzzle's imprisonment in the stable and it had been knocked crooked during his journey through the dark wood. Most of it was in a big lump on one shoulder. The head, besides being pushed sideways, had somehow got very far back so that anyone could now see his silly, gentle, donkeyish face gazing out of it. Some grass stuck out of one corner of his mouth, for he'd been doing a little quiet nibbling as they brought him along. And he was muttering, "It wasn't my fault, I'm not clever. I never said I was."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="小矮人们现在可以逼近来瞧瞧它了，他们所看到的真相，肯定足以使他们心里感到奇怪：他们怎么竟会受骗上当的。迷惑长时间给关闭在马厩里，狮子毛皮已经弄得很不整洁了，而它在黑暗的树林里穿行时，毛皮又磕磕碰碰得歪歪扭扭了。大部分毛皮挤在肩膀上的一块地方。头上的毛皮，除了碰歪以外，还碰得向后缩了一大截，所以现在谁都看得见那愚蠢而温和的驴子脸蛋在向外张望。嘴角边露出一些青草。因为他们把它牵来时，它已经一声不响地啃了点青草而且它还在咕叨：“这不是我的过错，我不聪明。我从未说过我以前是聪明的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He flew upon the chief soldier like lightning. Eustace, who had drawn his sword when he saw the King draw his, rushed at the other one: his face was deadly pale, but I wouldn't blame him for that. And he had the luck that beginners sometimes do have. He forgot all that Tirian had tried to teach him that afternoon, slashed wildly (indeed I'm not sure his eyes weren't shut) and suddenly found, to his own great surprise, that the Calormene lay dead at his feet. And though that was a great relief, it was, at the moment, rather frightening. The King's fight lasted a second or two longer: then he too had killed his man and shouted to Eustace, "'Ware the other two."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他像闪电似的向士兵头目猛扑过去。尤斯塔斯看到国王拔剑，也拔出剑来，冲向另一个士兵：他的脸色苍白得像死人，但我不会因此责备他。而且他运道很好，初次作战的人有时总是幸运的。他把蒂莲在昨天下午竭力教给他的一切统统都忘掉了，疯狂地乱砍一气（事实上，我不能肯定他没有闭上眼睛）；使他自己大为吃惊的是：他突然发现那卡乐门士兵倒在他脚下，死了。虽然这是一大安慰，但在片刻之间，那倒是很吓人的。国王的战斗比他多了一两秒钟：他也杀死了对方，并且对尤斯塔斯大声喊道：“另外两个兵在哪儿呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="这最后一句话刚说出口，他就认识到他走错了一步棋。小矮人们立刻用一种嘲弄的咏叹调开始念叨：“可不是头驯服的狮子，可不是头驯服的狮子。”一个小矮人说：“这就是另一帮子不断跟我们说的话啊。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They were a silent party. Puzzle felt himself to be still in disgrace, and also he didn't really quite understand what had happened. Jill, besides being disgusted with the Dwarfs, was very impressed with Eustace's victory over the Calormene and felt almost shy. As for Eustace, his heart was still beating rather quickly. Tirian and Jewel walked sadly together in the rear. The King had his arm on the Unicorn's shoulder and sometimes the Unicorn nuzzled the King's cheek with his soft nose. They did not try to comfort one another with words. It wasn't very easy to think of anything to say that would be comforting. Tirian had never dreamed that one of the results of an Ape's setting up as a false Aslan would be to stop people from believing in the real one. He had felt quite sure that the Dwarfs would rally to his side the moment he showed them how they had been deceived. And then next night he would have led them to Stable Hill and shown Puzzle to all the creatures and everyone would have turned against the Ape and, perhaps after a scuffle with the Calormenes, the whole thing would have been over. But now, it seemed, he could count on nothing. How many other Narnians might turn the same way as the Dwarfs?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们是默默无言的一群。迷惑觉得它自己仍旧不光彩，它也确实不大明白发生了什么事情。吉尔除了对小矮人感到厌恶外，对尤斯塔斯之战胜卡乐门士兵印象深刻，自己几乎感到羞愧。至于尤斯塔斯，他的心仍旧怦怦地跳得很快，蒂莲和独角兽悲哀地一起走在后面。国王的手臂搁在独角兽的肩膀上，独角兽有时用它柔软的鼻子擦擦国王的面颊。他们不想用言词互相安慰。想起足以安慰人的任何词儿，都是很不容易的。蒂莲做梦也没有想到，无尾猿设置伪阿斯兰的一个不良后果，竟是导致人们不再相信真正的阿斯兰了。他本来深信不疑，只要他向小矮人们揭露了无尾猿怎样使他们受骗上当，小矮人们就立刻会站到他这边来的。第二夜他就可以率领他们上马厩山，把迷惑的真相暴露在众目睽睽之下，大家就会起而反抗无尾猿。也许经过同卡乐门士兵的一场混战，整个儿问题就会解决了。但，现在看起来，他什么也不能指望。其他的纳尼亚人，还有许多可能转而采取小矮人一样的态度哩。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was at the coldest hour of the night, just before dawn, that they got back to the Tower. If there had been a meal ready for them they would have been glad enough to eat, but the bother and delay of getting one was not to be thought of. They drank from a stream, splashed their faces with water, and tumbled into their bunks, except for Puzzle and Jewel who said they'd be more comfortable outside. This perhaps was just as well, for a Unicorn and a fat, full-grown Donkey indoors always make a room feel rather crowded.</div>

<div class="line_en">Narnian Dwarfs, though less than four feet high, are for their size about the toughest and strongest creatures there are, so that Poggin, in spite of a heavy day and a late night, woke fully refreshed before any of the others. He at once took Jill's bow, went out and shot a couple of wood pigeons. Then he sat plucking them on the doorstep and chatting to Jewel and Puzzle. Puzzle looked and felt a good deal better this morning. Jewel, being a Unicorn and therefore one of the noblest and delicatest of beasts, had been very kind to him, talking to him about things of the sort they could both understand like grass and sugar and the care of one's hoofs. When Jill and Eustace came out of the Tower yawning and rubbing their eyes at almost half past ten, the Dwarf showed them where they could gather plenty of a Narnian weed called Wild Fresney, which looks rather like our wood-sorrel but tastes a good deal nicer when cooked. (It needs a little butter and pepper to make it perfect, but they hadn't got these.) So that what with one thing and another, they had the makings of a capital stew for their breakfast or dinner, whichever you choose to call it. Tirian went a little further off into the wood with an axe and brought back some branches for fuel. While the meal was cooking -- which seemed a very long time, especially as it smelled nicer and nicer the nearer it came to being done -- the King found a complete Dwarfish outfit for Poggin: mail shirt, helmet, shield, sword, belt, and dagger. Then he inspected Eustace's sword and found that Eustace had put it back in the sheath all messy from killing the Calormene. He was scolded for that and made to clean and polish it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="纳尼亚的小矮人，虽然身高不到四英尺，就其身材而言，却是最吃苦耐劳和最强壮有力的动物；所以，波金虽然过了沉重的一天，夜间又睡得很晚，却比任何人都醒得早，醒来时体力完全恢复，已经神清气爽了。他立刻拿着吉尔的弓箭，走出去射中了两只林中野鸽。然后他坐在门前石阶上一边给鸽子拔毛，一边跟珍宝和迷惑闲谈。迷惑在这天早晨感到好得多了；珍宝是头独角兽，因而是兽类中最高贵而又最娇嫩的一种动物，它对待小矮人十分和蔼可亲，跟他说些双方都能理解的事情，例如青草呀、糖呀、对蹄子的爱护呀。在快要十点半的时候，吉尔和尤斯塔斯打着哈欠擦着眼睛，从堡垒里走出来，小矮人给他们看一种叫做野弗雷斯尼的纳尼亚野草；他们在那儿可以采集到许许多多，看起来外形像我们的酢浆草，但煮熟了吃起来，味道要好得多。（要使它尽善尽美，就需要加点儿黄油和胡椒，但他们手头没有这些玩意儿。）再加点儿这个那个的，他们就炖成了一个精美的菜肴作为他们的早餐或正餐（你愿意管它叫什么就叫什么）。蒂莲带着斧头稍稍深入树林，砍了些树枝带回来当柴火。那菜肴正炖着的时候——似乎炖的时间很长久——特别是接近于炖熟、香味愈来愈美妙时，更觉得炖久了，国王替波金找到了一整套小矮人装备：锁子甲、头盔、盾牌、剑、剑带和匕首。然后国王又检查了尤斯塔斯的剑，发现尤斯塔斯杀死了卡乐门士兵后就把血污的剑插进剑鞘里去了。国王责备他，叫他把剑揩干净擦亮。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But when the meal came everyone felt it had been worth waiting for, and there were second helpings all round. When everyone had eaten as much as he could, the three humans and the Dwarf came and sat on the doorstep, the four-footed ones lay down facing them, the Dwarf (with permission both from Jill and from Tirian) lit his pipe, and the King said:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但，当菜肴端上来的时候，大家都觉得是值得等待的了，而且一圈分过来后大家还有第二份可吃。谁都尽量吃了个畅快后，三个人和一个小矮人便来到门口台阶上坐下，两个四足动物面向着他们躺下，而小矮人得到吉尔和蒂莲的允许，点上了他的烟斗，于是国王开言道：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Now, friend Poggin, you have more news of the enemy, belike, than we. Tell us all you know. And first, what tale do they tell of my escape?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，朋友波金，你所知道的关于敌人的消息，极可能比我们多。把你所知道的，统统告诉我们吧。第一，对于我的脱身逃走，他们在编些什么故事？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"As cunning a tale, Sire, as ever was devised," said Poggin. "It was the Cat, Ginger, who told it, and most likely made it up too. This Ginger, Sire -- oh, he's a slyboots if ever a cat was -- said he was walking past the tree to which those villains bound your Majesty. And he said (saving your reverence) that you were howling and swearing and cursing Aslan: `language I wouldn't like to repeat' were the words he used, looking ever so prim and proper you know the way a Cat can when it pleases. And then, says Ginger, Aslan himself suddenly appeared in a flash of lightning and swallowed your Majesty up at one mouthful. All the Beasts trembled at this story and some fainted right away. And of course the Ape followed it up. There, he says, see what Aslan does to those who don't respect him. Let that be a warning to you all. And the poor creatures wailed and whined and said, it will, it will. So that in the upshot your Majesty's escape has not set them thinking whether you still have loyal friends to aid you, but only made them more afraid and more obedient to the Ape."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“陛下，编了个空前狡猾的故事，”波金说道，“故事是猫儿金格讲出来的，说不定也是它编造出来的。陛下，这个金格——啊，如果猫是滑头，那么它就是个老滑头——它说它正走过恶棍们把你绑在上面的那棵树。它说（我是冒昧如实汇报）你正在号叫骂人，诅咒阿斯兰。原话我不想重复了，尽管它用的词儿，看上去很正经很得体——你知道，一只猫儿如果高兴的话，它是能够说得这样的。据金格说，阿斯兰突然在一阵闪电中亲自出现了，一口就把陛下吞到他肚子里去了。所有的野兽听到这故事都哆哆嗦嗦，有的当场吓昏过去。当然，无尾猿就跟着添油加酱地发挥了。行了，无尾猿说，瞧瞧阿斯兰是怎么对待那些不尊敬他的人的吧！要把这件事看做是对你们大家的一个警告。于是可怜的野兽们号啕呜咽，说道，是呀，是呀。所以，陛下脱身逃遁的结果，并没使野兽们考虑你是否仍有王室的朋友在帮助你，却仅仅使野兽们更加害怕，对无尾猿更加俯首帖耳了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">All this while Jill went to and fro, sometimes stirring the pot and sometimes looking out enviously at the Donkey and the Unicorn who were contentedly grazing. How many times that morning she wished she could eat grass!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在这一段时间里，吉尔走来走去，有时搅搅锅里炖着的食物，有时妒忌地望着正在心满意足地吃草的驴子和独角兽。那天早晨，她好几次但愿她也能吃草哩。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"What devilish policy!" said Tirian. "This Ginger, then, is close in the Ape's counsels."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“多么阴险凶恶的政策！”蒂莲说道，“这样看来，这个金格是参与无尾猿的机密的啊。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's more a question by now, Sire, if the Ape is in his counsels," replied the Dwarf. "The Ape has taken to drinking, you see. My belief is that the plot is now mostly carried on by Ginger or Rishda -- that's the Calormene captain. And I think some words that Ginger has scattered among the Dwarfs are chiefly to blame for the scurvy return they made you. And I'll tell you why. One of those dreadful midnight meetings had just broken up the night before last and I'd gone a bit of the way home when I found I'd left my pipe behind. It was a real good 'un, an old favourite, so I went back to look for it. But before I got to the place where I'd been sitting (it was black as pitch there) I heard a cat's voice say Mew and a Calormene voice say `here… speak softly,' so I just stood as still as if I was frozen. And these two were Ginger and Rishda Tarkaan as they call him. `Noble Tarkaan,' said the Cat in that silky voice of his, `I just wanted to know exactly what we both meant today about Aslan meaning no more than Tash.' `Doubtless, most sagacious of cats,' says the other, `you have perceived my meaning.' `You mean,' says Ginger, `that there's no such person as either." "All who are enlightened know that,' said the Tarkaan. `Then we can understand one another,' purrs the Cat. `Do you, like me, grow a little weary of the Ape?' `A stupid, greedy brute,' says the other, `but we must use him for the present. Thou and I must provide for all things in secret and make the Ape do our will.' `And it would be better, wouldn't it,' said Ginger, `to let some of the more enlightened Narnians into our counsels: one by one as we find them apt. For the Beasts who really believe in Aslan may turn at any moment: and will, if the Ape's folly betrays his secret. But those who care neither for Tash nor Aslan but have only an eye to their own profit and such reward as The Tisroc may give them when Narnia is a Calormene province, will be firm.' `Excellent Cat,' said the Captain. `But choose which ones carefully."'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“陛下，现在问题是倒过来了：究竟无尾猿是否参与金格的机密。”小矮人答道，“你要明白，无尾猿如今沉湎于酗酒。我深信不疑，现在阴谋诡计大部分是由金格或利什达——那就是卡乐门队长——执行的。我认为金格在小矮人中散布的流言，主要应归罪于他们把你的脱身逃回说得太不光彩了。我要把其中的所以然告诉你。前天夜间，一个可怕的深更半夜的会议刚散，我在回家的路上才走了一小段路，发觉我把烟斗丢在那儿了。这是只确实极好的烟斗，是我多年心爱之物，所以我就回去找烟斗。但，我还没有走到我曾经坐过的地方，就听到喵的一声猫叫，听到一个卡乐门人的口音说道：‘这儿……说话要低声。’我就一动也不动地站着，仿佛我被冻僵了似的。这两个家伙，就是金格和利什达泰坎——他们都管他叫泰坎。‘高贵的泰坎，’猫儿金格用它那奉承讨好的声音说道，‘今儿个关于阿斯兰并不超过塔什的说法，我正想确切地知道，咱俩心里的意思是什么？’‘毫无疑问，众猫中最聪明的猫啊，’另一个说道，‘你已经看明白了我的意思。’‘你的意思是说，’金格道，‘两者之中，哪一个都是不存在的。’‘凡是有学问的人，大家都明白。’泰坎说。‘那么，我们是能够彼此了解的了。’猫儿道。‘你可像我一样，逐渐有点儿厌恶那头无尾猿了？’‘一头愚蠢而贪婪的野兽，’另一个说，‘但，眼前我们必须利用它。你和我必须暗中秘密准备好一切，叫无尾猿去完成我们的愿望。’‘让某些比较有学问的纳尼亚国民参与我们的机密，我们觉得恰当，便依次逐个吸收——这就会把事情搞得更好，难道不会吗？’金格道，‘因为，真正信仰阿斯兰的野兽，随时都可能转变的；而且，如果无尾猿暴露了它的秘密，它们就会自愿转变的。但，那些既不关心塔什神又不关心阿斯兰、眼睛只盯着它们自己的利益的，而纳尼亚成为卡乐门的一个省时，“蒂斯罗克”又会给以重赏的家伙，它们必将是坚定不移的。’‘高明的猫儿，’队长说，‘但选择哪一个可要小心谨慎啊。’”">查看中文翻译</div>
