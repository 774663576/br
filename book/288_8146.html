<div class="line_en">On Monday morning, we got up quite early and we went to swim before breakfast. On the way back, Montmorency behaved very stupidly.</div>

<div class="line_en">When I meet a cat, I say hello to it. Then I bend down and I stroke it gently, behind the ears and along the side of its head. The cat likes this. It puts its tail up and it pushes itself against my legs. And there is love and peace. When Montmorency meets a cat, everybody knows about it, and a lot of bad words are used.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我每次遇到猫，总会亲切地招呼它，俯下身轻轻抚摸它，摸摸它的耳后和脑袋旁边。猫呢，喜欢的就是这一套，它会竖起尾巴，把身体在我的腿上蹭蹭，充满了温柔和恬静的感觉。可是如果“元帅”遇见猫，那准会搅得四邻不安，直招别人的骂。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I do not really blame Montmorency (usually I just hit him, or throw stones at him), because dogs are like that. They hate cats. But that morning, Montmorency wished that he had not argued with a cat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我倒并不责怪“元帅”（通常不过敲它一下，或者用石子扔它），因为狗的本性就是这样，它们就是恨猫。但那天早上，它却宁可自己没有去招惹那只猫。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The only thing that Montmorency and I disagree about is cats. I like cats. Montmorency does not.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我和“元帅”只在一个问题上存在分歧，那就是对猫的看法：我喜欢猫，而“元帅”却不。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was a big, black cat. I have never seen a bigger cat. It had lost half its tail and one of its ears, but it looked calm and happy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那是一只又大又黑的猫。我从来没有见过这么大的猫，虽然掉了半只尾巴和一只耳朵，看上去还是一副泰然自若，满不在乎的样子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As we were coming back from the river, a cat ran out from one of the houses, and it began to walk across the road. Montmorency saw the cat, gave a shout of real happiness, and ran after it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们从河边回来时，一只猫从某间屋子里蹿出来，横着过马路。“元帅”一看见猫，无比幸福地发出一声欢呼，就追了下去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Montmorency ran at that cat as fast as he could, but the cat did not hurry. It did not seem to understand that its life was in danger. It walked on quietly until the enemy was near it. Then it turned and sat down in the middle of the road. It looked at Montmorency in a quiet way, and it seemed to say,'Yes? You want me?'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“元帅”使足了劲去追那只猫，可猫却不慌不忙，若无其事的，似乎没有意识到生命已受到威胁。它仍然不动声色地走着，直到敌人走近了才转过身，坐在马路中间，冷静、地看着“元帅”，好象在说：“怎么，你找我吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Montmorency is quite a brave dog, but there was something in the way the cat looked at him. It frightened him. He stopped suddenly, and he looked at the cat. They did not speak, of course, but it was easy to imagine their conversation.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“元帅”向来是只勇猛顽强的狗，可那只黑猫凛然看他的眼神却使这条英勇非凡的狗吓得矮了半截。它突然站住，瞪着眼看着黑猫。当然双方一言不发，但很容易想象它们俩的谈话内容。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After this we did our shopping, went back to the boat, and moved off along the river again. However, at Hambledon lock, we found that we had no water. So we went to ask the lock-keeper for some. George spoke for us. He said,' Oh, please, could you give us a little water?''Of course,'the old man replied. 'Just take what you want and leave the rest.

<div class="line_en">The basket was behind us, and George and I both turned to get a spoon. It took about five seconds. When we looked back again, Harris and the food had gone. It was an open field, and there were no trees. There was nowhere to hide. He had not fallen in the river, because we were between him and the water.</div>
