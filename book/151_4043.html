<div class="line_en">For a while, the "War" was all we talked about. February was when it was really at its worst. That's when practically nobody was talking to us, and Julian had started leaving notes in our lockers. The notes to Jack were stupid, like: You stink, big cheese! and Nobody likes you anymore!</div>

<div class="line_en">Beulah was a made-up person that me and Jack came up with. She had really gross habits, like eating the green stuff in between her toes and sucking on her knuckles. And we figured someone like that would have a real crush on Julian, who looked and acted like someone in a KidzBop commercial.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="比尤拉是我和杰克虚构出来的人物。她有很多很多恶心的习惯，喜欢吃脚趾缝里绿油油的东西，吮吸指关节。我们想象这样的一个人会深深迷恋上朱利安，因为他的长相和举手投足都很像KidzBop组合的某个成员。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Summer thought we should report the notes to Ms. Rubin, who was the middle-school dean, or even Mr. Tushman, but we thought that would be like snitching. Anyway, it's not like we didn't leave notes, too, though ours weren't really mean. They were kind of funny and sarcastic.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="萨默尔认为我们应该把这些纸条交给鲁宾小姐，她是初中部的教务长，或者干脆给图什曼先生，但我们觉得像是打小报告。好吧，不是说我们就不会留纸条，而是我们留的实在一点杀伤力都没有。只是有点搞笑和挖苦。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There were also a couple of times in February when Julian, Miles, and Henry played tricks on Jack. They didn't play tricks on me, I think, because they knew that if they got caught "bullying" me, it would be big-time trouble for them. Jack, they figured, was an easier target. So one time they stole his gym shorts and played Monkey in the Middle with them in the locker room. Another time Miles, who sat next to Jack in homeroom, swiped Jack's worksheet off his desk, crumpled it in a ball, and tossed it to Julian across the room. This wouldn't have happened if Ms. Petosa had been there, of course, but there was a substitute teacher that day, and subs never really know what's going on. Jack was good about this stuff. He never let them see he was upset, though I think sometimes he was.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="二月份朱利安、迈尔斯和亨利还捉弄过杰克好几次。他们倒没有捉弄我，我想，因为他们知道，一旦他们被逮到在“欺负”我，将会是个大麻烦。他们觉得，杰克是一个更容易的目标。因此，有一次他们偷了他的运动短裤，在更衣室里玩“猴子在中间”的游戏。还有一次，迈尔斯在年级室挨着杰克坐，他把杰克的作业单拂下桌，揉成团，掷给了教室另一头的朱利安。如果皮特莎小姐在的话，这种事当然不可能发生，但是那天来的是一个代课老师，她永远不会知道到底发生了什么。杰克对这类事情总是应付自如。他从来不让别人看出他很难过，不过我知道，他有时还是很难过的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The other kids in the grade knew about the war. Except for Savanna's group, the girls were neutral at first. But by March they were getting sick of it. And so were some of the boys. Like another time when Julian was dumping some pencil-sharpener shavings into Jack's backpack, Amos, who was usually tight with them, grabbed the backpack out of Julian's hands and returned it to Jack. It was starting to feel like the majority of boys weren't buying into Julian anymore.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们年级的其他同学都知道这场纷争。除了萨凡娜那一帮人，女孩子一开始都保持中立。但是到三月的时候，她们都厌倦了此事。有些男孩也是。比如有一次，朱利安正要往杰克的背包里倒铅笔屑，他们的死党阿莫斯一把把背包从朱利安手里抢过来，还给了杰克。我觉得好像大多数男生开始不买朱利安的账了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">People even joke around with me now sometimes. Like the other day I saw Maya writing a note to Ellie on a piece of Uglydoll stationery, and I don't know why, but I just kind of randomly said: "Did you know the guy who created the Uglydolls based them on me?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在也有人不时跟我开开玩笑。比如有一天我看见玛雅在一张丑娃娃信签上给艾莉留言，不知道为什么，我漫不经心地说了一句：“你知道创造丑娃娃的人是以我为标准的吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Maya looked at me with her eyes wide open like she totally believed me. Then, when she realized I was only kidding, she thought it was the funniest thing in the world.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛雅瞪大眼睛看着我，似乎信以为真。等反应过来我只是开玩笑时，她觉得这是世界上最好笑的事情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I'm pretty sure everyone's stopped playing the Plague game behind my back, too. No one really cringes if I bump into them anymore, and people borrow my pencils without acting like the pencil has cooties.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我确信大家也都不在我背后玩“瘟疫”游戏了。如果我偶然撞到他们，也没有人会再退缩了，别人向我借铅笔的时候也不会表现得好像笔上有虱子一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then a few weeks ago, Julian started spreading this ridiculous rumor that Jack had hired some "hit man" to "get" him and Miles and Henry. This lie was so pathetic that people were actually laughing about him behind his back. At that point, any boys who had still been on his side now jumped ship and were clearly neutral. So by the end of March, only Miles and Henry were on Julian's side -- and I think even they were getting tired of the war by then.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在几个星期前，朱利安开始散播一个可笑的谣言，说杰克雇佣了一个“职业杀手”去“收拾”他、迈尔斯和亨利。这个谎言实在太无聊了，实际上大家都在背后笑话他。因为这件事，站在他那边的男生纷纷变节，明确转为中立。因此到三月底的时候，只有迈尔斯和亨利还站在朱利安那一边——我想，连他们也厌倦了这场“战争”。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You are so funny, August!" she said, and then she told Ellie and some of the other girls what I had just said, and they all thought it was funny, too. Like at first they were shocked, but then when they saw I was laughing about it, they knew it was okay to laugh about it, too. And the next day I found a little Uglydoll key chain sitting on my chair with a nice little note from Maya that said: For the nicest Auggie Doll in the world! XO Maya.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你太好玩了，奥古斯特！”她说。然后她把我刚才说的话告诉了艾莉和其他女生，大家也都觉得很好玩。好像一开始她们觉得很震惊，但看到我一笑了之，便明白可以放心地拿这件事情开玩笑了。第二天，我发现我的椅子上放着一只丑娃娃钥匙扣，还有一张玛雅的便条，上面写道：送给世界上最可爱的奥吉娃娃！亲亲，玛雅。">查看中文翻译</div>
