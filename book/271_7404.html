<div class="line_en">"A very talented family," Eleazar murmured as he paced. His tempo was increasing; he flashed from the door to Carmen and back again every second. "A mind reader for a father, a shield for a mother, and then whatever magic this extraordinary child has bewitched us with. I wonder if there is a name for what she does, or if it is the norm for a vampire hybrid. As if such a thing could ever be considered normal! A vampire hybrid, indeed!"</div>

<div class="line_en">Eleazar looked at Edward curiously, his manic pacing forgotten for the moment. "A shield, I think. She's blocking me now, so I can't be sure."</div>

<div class="line_en">"A shield?" Edward repeated, bewildered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“守护盾？”爱德华迷惑地重复了一遍。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No," Edward murmured. "But I've never been able to do that. Even when she was human."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“就是，爱德华！如果我现在读不到她，我敢说你也不行。你现在能听到她的思想吗？”以利亚撒问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Never?" Eleazar blinked. "Interesting. That would indicate a rather powerful latent talent, if it was manifesting so clearly even before the transformation. I can't feel a way through her shield to get a sense of it at all. Yet she must be raw still -- she's only a few months old." The look he gave Edward now was almost exasperated. "And apparently completely unaware of what she's doing. Totally unconscious. Ironic. Aro sent me all over the world searching for such anomalies, and you simply stumble across it by accident and don't even realize what you have." Eleazar shook his head in disbelief.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“从没？”以利亚撒眨了眨眼。“有趣。如果说在她变化前就显露得这么明显的话，肯定暗示着一个了不起的天赋。我完全无法穿透她的盾来搞清楚，尽管她还毫无经验——她才只有几个月大而已。”他对爱德华投去恼火的一眼。“而且显然她对自己的能力一无所知，甚至都没察觉到。多么讽刺啊，阿罗让我满世界的为他寻找这样异能的人，而你只是偶然就得到了却毫无自觉？”以利亚撒不可置信地摇着头。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="我花了几秒钟思考，脑袋飞速的运转，考虑我该怎么回答。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Eleazar leaned his head to one side as he examined me. "I suppose we were overly formal about it in the guard. In truth, categorizing talents is a subjective, haphazard business; every talent is unique, never exactly the same thing twice. But you, Bella, are fairly easy to classify. Talents that are purely defensive, that protect some aspect of the bearer, are always called shields. Have you ever tested your abilities? Blocked anyone besides me and your mate?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="以利亚撒把头偏了偏审视着我。“我们基本上能肯定你在防御上的才能了。说实话，对才能的分类是件主观随意的工作。并且每个才能都是独一无二的，从不会有一模一样的两个。但你，贝拉，你很好分类，你的才能就是纯粹的防御，那些能够为持有人提供保护的能力，通常就被称为守护盾。你有测试过自己的能力吗？对除了我和你丈夫之外的人防御？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I frowned. "What are you talking about? How can I be a shield? What does that even mean?" All I could picture in my head was a ridiculous medieval suit of armor.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Purely a mental defense." Eleazar nodded to himself. "Limited, but strong."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那就是精神上的防御，”以利亚撒自顾自地点了点头。“范围有限，但是非常强大。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Aro couldn't hear her," Edward interjected. "Though she was human when they met."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“阿罗也听不到她，”爱德华也提出。“虽然他们见面时她还只是人类而已。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“雷娜塔是阿罗的私人贴身护卫，”以利亚撒回答我。“是一种很实用的盾，非常强大。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Eleazar had recovered slightly. "Yes, no talent ever manifests in precisely the same way, because no one ever thinks in exactly the same way."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="以利亚撒稍微回了点神。“是的，没有才能是一模一样的，因为本来每个人的思维模式就不一样。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I wonder…," Eleazar mused. "You see, Renata is a powerful shield against a physical attack. If someone approaches her -- or Aro, as she is always close beside him in a hostile situation -- they find themselves… diverted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我在想…”以利亚撒边想边说道。“你看，雷娜塔的是一种强大的针对物理攻击的盾。如果有人要攻击她或是阿罗，因为她一直紧紧地守在阿罗身边，他们会发现自己…转向了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There's a force around her that repels, though it's almost unnoticeable. You simply find yourself going a different direction than you planned, with a confused memory as to why you wanted to go that other way in the first place. She can project her shield several meters out from herself. She also protects Caius and Marcus, too, when they have a need, but Aro is her priority.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因为在她的周围有一层能够逐退别人的力量，几乎察觉不到，你只会发现自己没头没脑地搞错了方向，并且完全想不起来为什么会朝那边去。她还能将盾的范围向外推出几米远，需要的时候可以将卡尤斯和马库斯也纳入保护范围内，不过首要保护的还是阿罗。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What she does isn't actually physical, though. Like the vast majority of our gifts, it takes place inside the mind. If she tried to keep you back, I wonder who would win?" He shook his head. "I've never heard of Aro's or Jane's gifts being thwarted."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“但她可以防御的其实不只是物理。就像我们所有人的天赋一样，它是由心操纵的。如果她绝对不想让你靠近的话，我怀疑谁能赢得了她？”他摇了摇头。“我还从来没有见过阿罗或简的能力被阻止了的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Edward nodded, his tense eyes following Eleazar as he spoke. "He was trying to understand why so many of the Volturi would come to punish us. It's not the way they do things. Certainly, we are the biggest mature coven they've dealt with, but in the past other covens have joined to protect themselves, and they never presented much of a challenge despite their numbers. We are more closely bonded, and that's a factor, but not a huge one.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱德华点头，目光紧张地追随着以利亚撒，说道，“他想知道为什么沃尔图里会出动这么多人来惩罚我们。这不是他们的行事风格。当然，我们是他们所面对过的最大的家族，不过以前也有几个家族联合起来自卫的情况，不管对方人数多少他们都没有出动过这么多人手。我们家族成员之间的联系要紧密得多，这大概是其中一个因素，但并不是很重要。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"What was this pattern?" Carmen asked, watching Eleazar as Edward was.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“什么典例？”卡门问道，目光就同爱德华的一样追随着以利亚撒。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Aro does not often personally attend a punishing expedition," Edward said. "But in the past, when Aro wanted something in particular, it was never long before evidence turned up proving that this coven or that coven had committed some unpardonable crime. The ancients would decide to go along to watch the guard administer justice. And then, once the coven was all but destroyed, Aro would grant a pardon to one member whose thoughts, he would claim, were particularly repentant. Always, it would turn out that this vampire had the gift Aro had admired. Always, this person was given a place with the guard. The gifted vampire was won over quickly, always so grateful for the honor. There were no exceptions."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“阿罗并不经常参加那些需要长途跋涉的惩罚行动，”爱德华说。“但在以前，当阿罗特别想要某样东西的时候，他们会在得到那家族犯下不可饶恕罪行的确切证据就采取行动，于是长老们便会要求跟警卫们一起去见证判决。然后，就在那家族被毁灭之前，阿罗会宽恕其中某个人，宣称他读到那人已经完全忏悔了。通常来说，那个被宽恕的吸血鬼是都有着阿罗非常欣赏的天赋，然后那人会被授予警卫的职位。那些有天赋的吸血鬼会很快地被他征服，并且都会对这份荣誉满怀感激，没有一个例外。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He was remembering other times that covens have been punished, for one thing or the other, and a pattern occurred to him. It was a pattern that the rest of the guard would never have noticed, since Eleazar was the one passing the pertinent intelligence privately to Aro. A pattern that only repeated every other century or so."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他便开始回忆其他那些被惩罚家族的情况，一个又一个，然后有一些典例卡住了他。那典例其他警卫从来没注意到过，还是在以利亚撒当阿罗的私人智囊的时候。而且这种典例大概一个世纪会重演一次。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Eleazar came to an abrupt halt. "We all understood why Chelsea was important. In a fight, if we could separate allegiances between allied covens, we could defeat them that much more easily. If we could distance the innocent members of a coven emotionally from the guilty, justice could be done without unnecessary brutality -- the guilty could be punished without interference, and the innocent could be spared. Otherwise, it was impossible to keep the coven from fighting as a whole. So Chelsea would break the ties that bound them together. It seemed a great kindness to me, evidence of Aro's mercy. I did suspect that Chelsea kept our own band more tightly knit, but that, too, was a good thing. It made us more effective. It helped us coexist more easily."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="以利亚撒突然冒出来打断，说道。“我们都明白为什么切尔西如此重要。在一场战斗中，如果能离间对方成员间的感情，这仗打起来就容易多了。如果我们能疏远其中某无罪成员与这个罪恶团体的关系，那惩罚就无需这么严厉了——只用惩处罪恶，给与悔悟者宽恕。否则，想要战胜一个紧密的家庭不是件容易的事。所以切尔西会破坏那种家族成员间的联系。好吧，这太好了，我竟然就是阿罗这种仁慈的活生生的例子，我现在非常怀疑切尔西也加强过我和阿罗间的联系，虽然在那时是件好事。它令我们容易被信服，让我们共同生活起来更轻松一些。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I could only think that the reason Aro had decided to come himself, to bring so many with him, is because his goal is not punishment but acquisition," Eleazar said. "He needs to be there to control the situation. But he needs the entire guard for protection from such a large, gifted coven. On the other hand, that leaves the other ancients unprotected in Volterra. Too risky -- someone might try to take advantage. So they all come together. How else could he be sure to preserve the gifts that he wants? He must want them very badly," Eleazar mused.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我能想到的让阿罗带这么多人亲自前来的原因只有，他确实是想要某样东西，”以利亚撒说。“他得亲手掌控住场面。但面对这样出色的家族，他需要整个警卫队来保护自己的安全。另一方面来说，这样会使沃尔特拉其他那些元老们失去保护，身陷险境。这非常冒险，需要先发制人。所以他们就干脆全员出动了。这次他想弄到手的才能是什么？他肯定是想疯了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
