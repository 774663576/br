<div class="line_en">In spite of his being allowed once more to live, however, he did notfeel the continuance of his existence secure, till he had revealed hispresent engagement; for the publication of that circumstance, hefeared, might give a sudden turn to his constitution, and carry him offas rapidly as before. With apprehensive caution therefore it wasrevealed, and he was listened to with unexpected calmness. Mrs. Ferrars at first reasonably endeavoured to dissuade him from marryingMiss Dashwood, by every argument in her power; -- told him, that in MissMorton he would have a woman of higher rank and larger fortune; -- andenforced the assertion, by observing that Miss Morton was the daughterof a nobleman with thirty thousand pounds, while Miss Dashwood was onlythe daughter of a private gentleman with no more than THREE; but whenshe found that, though perfectly admitting the truth of herrepresentation, he was by no means inclined to be guided by it, shejudged it wisest, from the experience of the past, to submit-andtherefore, after such an ungracious delay as she owed to her owndignity, and as served to prevent every suspicion of good-will, sheissued her decree of consent to the marriage of Edward and Elinor.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I will not say that I am disappointed, my dear sister," said John, asthey were walking together one morning before the gates of DelafordHouse, "THAT would be saying too much, for certainly you have been oneof the most fortunate young women in the world, as it is. But, Iconfess, it would give me great pleasure to call Colonel Brandonbrother. His property here, his place, his house, every thing is insuch respectable and excellent condition! -- and his woods! -- I have notseen such timber any where in Dorsetshire, as there is now standing inDelaford Hanger! -- And though, perhaps, Marianne may not seem exactlythe person to attract him-yet I think it would altogether be advisablefor you to have them now frequently staying with you, for as ColonelBrandon seems a great deal at home, nobody can tell what mayhappen-for, when people are much thrown together, and see little ofanybody else-and it will always be in your power to set her off toadvantage, and so forth; -- in short, you may as well give her achance-You understand me." --</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一天早晨，他们一道在德拉福大宅第门前散步时，约翰说道：“我的好妹妹，我不想说我感到失望。这样说也许有点过分，因为事实上你当然是个世上最幸运的年轻女人。不过，坦白地说，我倘若能把布兰登上校称作妹夫，那我会感到高兴之至。他在这里的财产、地位和住宅，—切都是那样体面，那样优越！还有他的树林！现在生长在德拉福坡林上的那种树木，我在多塞特郡的其他地方还从未见到过呢。也许玛丽安不像是个对他有吸引力的姑娘，不过我想你们最好让他俩经常和你们呆在一起。因为布兰登上校在这里非常怡然自得，谁也说不上会出现什么情况——因为如果两个人碰到一起，见不到其他任何人。——你们总有办法把玛丽安打扮得绰约多姿……总而言之，你们不纺给她个机会。你懂得我的意思。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The first month after their marriage was spent with their friend at theMansion-house; from whence they could superintend the progress of theParsonage, and direct every thing as they liked on the spot; -- couldchuse papers, project shrubberies, and invent a sweep. Mrs. Jennings'sprophecies, though rather jumbled together, were chiefly fulfilled; forshe was able to visit Edward and his wife in their Parsonage byMichaelmas, and she found in Elinor and her husband, as she reallybelieved, one of the happiest couples in the world.

<div class="line_en">But though Mrs. Ferrars DID come to see them, and always treated themwith the make-believe of decent affection, they were never insulted byher real favour and preference. THAT was due to the folly of Robert, and the cunning of his wife; and it was earned by them before manymonths had passed away. The selfish sagacity of the latter, which hadat first drawn Robert into the scrape, was the principal instrument ofhis deliverance from it; for her respectful humility, assiduousattentions, and endless flatteries, as soon as the smallest opening wasgiven for their exercise, reconciled Mrs. Ferrars to his choice, andre-established him completely in her favour.</div>

<div class="line_en">The whole of Lucy's behaviour in the affair, and the prosperity whichcrowned it, therefore, may be held forth as a most encouraging instanceof what an earnest, an unceasing attention to self-interest, howeverits progress may be apparently obstructed, will do in securing everyadvantage of fortune, with no other sacrifice than that of time andconscience. When Robert first sought her acquaintance, and privately visited her in Bartlett's Buildings, it was only with the view imputedto him by his brother. He merely meant to persuade her to give up theengagement; and as there could be nothing to overcome but the affection of both, he naturally expected that one or two interviews would settlethe matter. In that point, however, and that only, he erred; -- forthough Lucy soon gave him hopes that his eloquence would convince herin TIME, another visit, another conversation, was always wanted toproduce this conviction. Some doubts always lingered in her mind whenthey parted, which could only be removed by another half hour'sdiscourse with himself. His attendance was by this means secured, andthe rest followed in course. Instead of talking of Edward, they camegradually to talk only of Robert, -- a subject on which he had alwaysmore to say than on any other, and in which she soon betrayed aninterest even equal to his own; and in short, it became speedilyevident to both, that he had entirely supplanted his brother. He wasproud of his conquest, proud of tricking Edward, and very proud ofmarrying privately without his mother's consent. What immediatelyfollowed is known. They passed some months in great happiness atDawlish; for she had many relations and old acquaintances to cut-andhe drew several plans for magnificent cottages; -- and from thencereturning to town, procured the forgiveness of Mrs. Ferrars, by thesimple expedient of asking it, which, at Lucy's instigation, wasadopted. The forgiveness, at first, indeed, as was reasonable, comprehended only Robert; and Lucy, who had owed his mother no duty andtherefore could have transgressed none, still remained some weekslonger unpardoned. But perseverance in humility of conduct andmessages, in self-condemnation for Robert's offence, and gratitude forthe unkindness she was treated with, procured her in time the haughtynotice which overcame her by its graciousness, and led soon afterwards, by rapid degrees, to the highest state of affection and influence. Lucy became as necessary to Mrs. Ferrars, as either Robert or Fanny; and while Edward was never cordially forgiven for having once intendedto marry her, and Elinor, though superior to her in fortune and birth, was spoken of as an intruder, SHE was in every thing considered, andalways openly acknowledged, to be a favourite child. They settled intown, received very liberal assistance from Mrs. Ferrars, were on thebest terms imaginable with the Dashwoods; and setting aside thejealousies and ill-will continually subsisting between Fanny and Lucy, in which their husbands of course took a part, as well as the frequentdomestic disagreements between Robert and Lucy themselves, nothingcould exceed the harmony in which they all lived together.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="露西在这件事中的整个行为及其获得的荣华富贵，可以被视为一个极其鼓舞人心的事例，说明对于自身利益，只要刻意追求，锲而不舍，不管表面上看来有多大阻力，都会取得圆满成功，除了要牺牲时间和良心之外，别无其他代价。罗伯特最初去找她，在巴特利特大楼对她进行私访时，本是带着他哥哥所说的目的去的。他只打算劝说她放弃这门婚事，再说他不过就是要制服两个人的感情，他便自然而然地认为：谈上一两次就能解决问题。不想在这一点上，也只是在这一点上，他算计错了。因为虽说露西给他希望，觉得凭着他的能说会道，迟早总会说服她，但每次总是需要再见一面，再谈一次，才能达到说服她的目的。他们分别的时候，露西心里总是存有几分疑虑，只有同他再交谈半个小时才能消释。就用这个办法，她把他给套住了，事情往后就顺当了。他们不再谈论爱德华，而是渐渐地只谈起罗伯特。一谈起自己，罗伯特总是比谈论什么话题都健谈，而露西也马上显得同样兴致勃勃。总之一句活，双方迅即发现，罗伯特已经完全取代了哥哥的位置。他为他赢得了露西的爱情感到得意，为他戏弄了爱德华感到骄傲，为不经母亲同意而秘密结婚感到自豪。紧接着发生的事情，大家已经知道。他们在道利希非常快乐地度过了几个月，因为露西可以摆脱许多亲戚旧交—一罗伯特还设计了几幢豪华的乡舍。他们随后回到城里，在露西的唆使下，经罗伯特简简单单地一要求，便取得了费拉斯太太的宽恕。理所当然，一开始得到宽恕的只是罗伯特。露西对他母亲本来就不负有义务，因而也谈不到背信弃义。又过了几个星期，她仍然没有得到宽恕。但是她继续装作低三下四的样子，一再对罗伯特的罪过引咎自责，对她自己受到的苛刻待遇表示感激，最后终于受到了费拉斯太太的赏识。尽管太太表现得有些傲慢，但露西深为她的宽宏大量所折服，此后不久，她便迅速达到了最受宠爱、最有影响的地步。对于费拉斯太太说来，露西变得像罗伯特和范妮一样必不可少。爱德华因为一度想娶她而一直得不到真诚的谅解，埃丽诺虽说财产和出身都胜她一筹。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">What Edward had done to forfeit the right of eldest son, might have puzzled many people to find out; and what Robert had done to succeed toit, might have puzzled them still more. It was an arrangement, however, justified in its effects, if not in its cause; for nothingever appeared in Robert's style of living or of talking to give asuspicion of his regretting the extent of his income, as either leavinghis brother too little, or bringing himself too much; -- and if Edwardmight be judged from the ready discharge of his duties in everyparticular, from an increasing attachment to his wife and his home, andfrom the regular cheerfulness of his spirits, he might be supposed noless contented with his lot, no less free from every wish of anexchange.</div>

<div class="line_en">Elinor's marriage divided her as little from her family as could wellbe contrived, without rendering the cottage at Barton entirely useless, for her mother and sisters spent much more than half their time withher. Mrs. Dashwood was acting on motives of policy as well as pleasurein the frequency of her visits at Delaford; for her wish of bringing Marianne and Colonel Brandon together was hardly less earnest, though rather more liberal than what John had expressed. It was now herdarling object. Precious as was the company of her daughter to her, she desired nothing so much as to give up its constant enjoyment to hervalued friend; and to see Marianne settled at the mansion-house wasequally the wish of Edward and Elinor.
