<div class="line_en">Laila remembers the poster of Ahmad Shah Massoud that Mammy had nailed to the wall of her bedroom. Massoud leaning forward, one eyebrow cocked, his face furrowed in concentration, as though he was respectfully listening to someone. Laila remembers how grateful Mammy was that Massoud had said a graveside prayer at her sons' burial, how she told everyone about it. Even after war broke out between his faction and the others, Mammy had refused to blame him. He's a good man, she used to say. He wants peace. He wants to rebuild Afghanistan. But they won't let him. They just won't let him. For Mammy, even in the end, even after everything went so terribly wrong and Kabul lay in ruins, Massoud was still the Lion of Panjshir.</div>

<div class="line_en">Laila is not as forgiving. Massoud's violent end brings her no joy, but she remembers too well the neighborhoods razed under his watch, the bodies dragged from the rubble, the hands and feet of children discovered on rooftops or the high branch of some tree days after their funeral. She remembers too clearly the look on Mammy's own face moments before the rocket slammed in and, much as she has tried to forget, Babi's headless torso landing nearby, the bridge tower printed on his T-shirt poking through thick fog and blood.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莱拉没有这么宽容。马苏德的惨死没有令她高兴，但她无法忘记的是，在马苏德掌权的时候，各处城区被夷为平地，尸体从乱石堆中被扒出来，已经下葬的儿童的手脚在屋顶或树木的高枝之上被人发现。她也清楚地记得那枚火箭弹飞进来之前妈妈脸上的表情，还有那想忘也忘不了的场景：爸爸那失去脑袋的躯体落在她旁边，印在他的恤衫上的桥塔刺穿了浓雾和血迹。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Taliban have announced that they won't relinquish bin Laden because he is a mehman, a guest, who has found sanctuary in Afghanistan and it is against the Pashtunwali code of ethics to turn over a guest.

<div class="line_cn" title="那次袭击之后几天，莱拉和塔里克又来到酒店大堂。电视机的屏幕上，乔治·布什正在发表演讲。他身后有一面很大的美国国旗。说到中途，布什的声音颤抖着，莱拉以为他就要哭起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They have finished making love. He's lying beside her, his head on her chest, his arm draped over her belly. The first few times they tried, there was difficulty. Tariq was all apologies, Laila all reassurances. There are still difficulties, not physical now but logistical. The shack they share with the children is small. The children sleep on cots below them and so there is little privacy. Most times, Laila and Tariq make love in silence, with controlled, muted passion, fully clothed beneath the blanket as a precaution against interruptions by the children. They are forever wary of the rustling sheets, the creaking bedsprings. But for Laila, being with Tariq is worth weathering these apprehensions. When they make love, Laila feels anchored, she feels sheltered. Her anxieties, that their life together is a temporary blessing, that soon it will come loose again in strips and tatters, are allayed. Her fears of separation vanish.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们刚结束做爱。他躺在她身边，头枕着她的胸膛，手臂放在她的小腹上。刚开始的时候，他们试了几次都没做成。塔里克不停地道歉，莱拉不停地宽慰他。现在还是有困难，但不是身体有问题，而是客观条件不许可。他们和两个孩子同住的房子太小了。孩子就睡在他们身边的床铺上，所以他们没有隐秘的空间。多数时候，莱拉和塔里克默默地做爱，无声地压抑着心中的激情，穿着全套衣服，盖着毛毯，以防突然被孩子打断。他们总是担心床单的沙沙声和弹簧床的吱嘎声。但对莱拉而言，只要能够和塔里克相处，忍受再多的焦虑她也心甘情愿。当他们做爱的时候，莱拉有一种靠岸的感觉，一种找到庇护的感觉。她一直担心他们在一起的生活是一种短暂的幸福；每次做爱之后不久，这种焦虑就会丝丝点点地涌上心头；但做爱的时候，她会放下这个重担。她不再害怕两人会分开。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I don't want to talk about this anymore," Laila says, surprised at how she has lashed out at him. It's unfair, she knows, what she said to him -- hadn't war taken his parents too?-- and whatever flared in her is softening already. Tariq continues to speak gently, and, when he pulls her to him, she lets him. When he kisses her hand, then her brow, she lets him. She knows that he is probably right. She knows how his comment was intended. Maybe this is necessary. Maybe there will be hope when Bush's bombs stop falling. But she cannot bring herself to say it, not when what happened to Babi and Mammy is happening to someone now in Afghanistan, not when some unsuspecting girl or boy back home has just been orphaned by a rocket as she was. Laila cannot bring herself to say it. It's hard to rejoice. It seems hypocritical, perverse.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不想再谈论这个话题了。”莱拉说。她为自己竟然朝他发火而感到吃惊。这不公平，她知道，她所说的话对他并不公平——他的父母不也是被战争夺走的吗？——她心中的怒火已经渐渐平息。塔里克继续温柔地说着，当他把她拉过去时，她没有反抗。她任凭他亲吻她的手、她的额头。她知道他说的可能没错。她知道他想说的是什么。也许这场战争是必须的。也许当布什的炸弹不再落下来时，那儿会有一丝希望。但现在，爸爸和妈妈的悲惨遭遇正在某些阿富汗人身上重演；某些毫无心理准备的女孩或男孩回到家中，却和她一样，发现自己被一枚火箭弹炸成孤儿；此时此刻，她怎能说出这句话？莱拉无法让这句话从她口中说出来。她无法感到欣慰。此时此刻，欣慰是一种虚伪的、缺德的感觉。">查看中文翻译</div>

He straps on his prosthesis and walks over to Zalmai, lifts him up into his arms. From the bed, Laila watches Tariq's shape moving back and forth in the darkness.
