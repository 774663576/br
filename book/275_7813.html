<div class="line_en">Then the boy went to a university and studied diligently. His teachers praised him, and he remained there for some time. After he had worked through a few classes, but was still not perfect in everything, the little pittance that the father had saved was all spent, and the boy had to return home to him.</div>

<div class="line_en">Once upon a time there was a poor woodcutter who worked from morning until late at night. When he had finally saved up some money he said to his boy, "You are my only child. I want to spend the money that I have earned by the sweat of my brow on your education. Learn an honest trade so you can support me in my old age when my limbs have grown stiff and I have to sit at home."</div>

<div class="line_en">But the son went into the woods, ate his bread, was very cheerful, and looked into the green branches to see if he could find a bird's nest.

He stood there looking at it, and thought, "Many a bird must have built its nest in that tree."</div>

<div class="line_en">The student began to scrape about beneath the tree, searching among the roots, until at last he found a glass bottle in a little opening. Lifting it up, he held it against the light, and then saw something shaped like a frog jumping up and down inside.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="小伙子开始在树根周围挖了起来，终於在一处小土坑里找到了一只玻璃瓶。他抢起玻璃瓶，对着阳光看了看，只见有一个青蛙模样的小东西，在瓶中疯狂地上窜下跳。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Let me out. Let me out," it cried again, and the student, thinking no evil, pulled the cork from the bottle. Immediately a spirit ascended from it and began to grow.

No, it was a punishment. I am the mighty Mercurius. I must break the neck of whomsoever releases me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="「甚么这个那个的，反正你一定得接受你应该得到的回报。难道你以为，我是被无缘无故地关押在那儿的吗？不是的，这是对我的惩罚。我是威力无比的墨丘利尤斯呀，不管谁放我出来，我一定得拧断他的脖子。」">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Calm down," answered the student. "Not so fast. First I must know that you really were shut up in that little bottle, and that you are the right spirit. If you can indeed get inside again, then I will believe it, and you may do with me whatsoever you want."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="「好吧，」小伙子冷静地回答说，「不过，这可急不得。首先呢，你得向我证明一下，刚才坐在那个小瓶子里的人确确实实就是你这么个庞然大物。你要是能再钻进去，我就服气了，然后，我就任你处置好啦。」">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You should have said so sooner," answered the student, "for then I would have left you shut up inside. However, my head is going to stay where it is until more people have been consulted."</div>

<div class="line_en">The spirit said arrogantly, "that is an easy trick," pulling himself in and making himself as thin and short as he had been before. He then crept back into the opening and through the neck of the bottle. He was scarcely inside when the student pushed the cork back into the bottle, and threw it back where it had been among the oak roots. And thus the spirit was deceived.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="妖怪趾高气扬地回答道：「小菜一碟。」说着就开始把身子缩小，越缩越小，最后小到能够从瓶口钻进去了。妖怪刚钻进瓶子里，小伙子立刻麻利地把瓶塞用力塞紧，随手把瓶子扔回到树根旁的老地方。妖怪就这样被挫败了。">查看中文翻译</div>
