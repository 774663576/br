<div class="line_en">The war was now over but Guiliano's had just begun. In the course of two years, Salvatore Guiliano had become the most famous man in Sicily. He built up his domination of the northwest corner of the island. At the heart of his empire was the town of Montelepre. He controlled the towns of Piani dei Greci, Borgetto and Partinico. And the murderous town of Corleone, whose inhabitants were so ferocious they were notorious even in Sicily. He ranged just short of Trapani, and he threatened the town of Monreale and the capital of Sicily itself, Palermo. When the new democratic government in Rome put a price of ten million lire on his head, Guiliano laughed and continued to move confidently through many of the towns. He even dined occasionally in the restaurants of Palermo. At the end of the meal he would always leave a note under the plate which read, "This is to show that Turi Guiliano can go wherever he likes."</div>

<div class="line_en">Guiliano's impregnable fortress was the vast galleries of the Cammarata Mountains. He knew all the caves and all the secret paths. He felt invincible here. He loved the view of Montelepre below him, the Partinico plain that stretched away to Trapani and the Mediterranean Sea. As twilight became blue, reflecting the faraway sea, he could see the ruined Greek temples, the orange groves, the olive orchards and the grain-filled fields that were Western Sicily. With his binoculars he could see the padlocked roadside shrines holding their dusty saints inside.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a countryside that fed Guiliano and his men. There were the olive and orange groves, the vineyards of grapes. There were the flocks of sheep whose shepherds looked the other way when the bandits came for a few lambs. Through this landscape Guiliano moved like a ghost, lost in the hazy blue light of Sicily which is the cerulean Mediterranean Sea reflected from the sky.</div>

<div class="line_en">From these mountains he sallied forth with his men onto the white dusty roads to rob government convoys, stick up railway trains, and relieve rich women of their jewels. The peasants riding on their painted carts in holy festivals saluted him and his men at first with fear and then with respect and affection. There was not one of them, not a shepherd or laborer who had not benefited from his distribution of loot.</div>

<div class="line_en">The winter months were long in the mountains, cold. And yet Guiliano's band grew. At night scores of campfires freckled the slopes and valleys of the Cammarata range. The men used the firelight to clean their guns, repair their clothing, do their laundry in the nearby mountain stream. Preparing the communal evening meal sometimes caused arguments. Every village in Sicily had a different recipe for squid and eels, disagreed on what herbs should be disbarred from the tomato sauce. And whether sausages should ever be baked. Men partial to the knife for murder liked to do laundry; the kidnappers preferred the cooking and sewing chores. The raiders of banks and trains stuck to cleaning their guns.</div>

<div class="line_en">Guiliano made them all dig defense trenches and establish far-flung listening posts so they could not be surprised by government forces. One day when the men were digging they came upon the skeleton of a giant animal, bigger than they could imagine. Hector Adonis arrived that day bringing books for Guiliano to study, for Guiliano was curious now to know everything in the world. He studied books of science, of medicine, of politics, philosophy and military techniques. Hector Adonis brought him sackfuls every few weeks. Guiliano took him to where the men had dug up the skeleton. Adonis smiled at their puzzlement. "Haven't I given you enough books on history?" he said to Guiliano. "A man who does not know the history of mankind for the last two thousand years is a man living in the dark." He paused for a few moments. The mellow voice of Adonis was the lecturing voice of a professor.</div>

Guiliano spent most of the winter studying his books and making his plans. He had long talks with Hector Adonis.</div>

<div class="line_en">And Guiliano did think all that night. The idea pleased him that he would someday be one of the ghosts of history.

<div class="line_en">In early spring he went with Pisciotta down the road that led to Trapani. On that road they saw a cart with new painted legends on its sides. For the first time they saw a panel showing the legend of Guiliano. It was a scene painted in gaudy reds, Guiliano taking the emerald ring from the finger of the Duchess as he bowed before her. In the background was Pisciotta holding a machine gun and threatening a group of cowering armed men.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was on that day too that they first wore the belt buckles with an eagle and a lion rampant etched on a rectangular block of gold. The buckles had been made by Silvestro, who now served as their armorer. He had given them to Guiliano and Pisciotta. It became an emblem of their leadership of the band. Guiliano always wore it; Pisciotta only when he was with Guiliano. For Pisciotta often went into the towns and villages disguised, even into the city of Palermo.</div>

<div class="line_en">At night in the mountains Guiliano, when he took off the belt, studied the rectangular buckle of gold. On the left side, there was an eagle that looked like a man in feathers. On the right side was a lion rampant, its paws -- like the eagle's winged arms -- supporting a filigree circle between them. It looked as if together they were spinning a wheel of the world. The lion especially fascinated him with its human body below the leonine head. The king of the air, the king of the ground, etched into soft yellow, gold. Guiliano thought of himself as the eagle, Pisciotta the lion, and that circle, Sicily.</div>

<div class="line_en">For centuries, kidnapping of the rich had been one of the cottage industries of Sicily. Usually the kidnappers were the most fearsome of the Mafiosi, who had merely to send a letter before the kidnapping. This would be in the polite form, to the effect that to avoid troublesome details the ransom be paid in advance. Like a wholesaler's discount for immediate cash payment, the ransom would be considerably less because all the irritating details, such as the actual kidnapping, did not have to be performed. For in all truth, such a thing as kidnapping a famous personage was not as easy as people thought it was. It was not a business for greedy amateurs or scatterbrained lazy good-for-nothings who refused to work for a living. Nor was it ever the harebrained, suicidal event that it was in America, where its practitioners had given kidnapping a bad name. Even the word "kidnapping" was not used in Sicily, since children were not held for ransom unless they were accompanied by an adult. For say what you would of a Sicilian: that they were born criminals, that they murdered as easily as a woman picks flowers, that they were as cunningly treacherous as Turks, that they were socially three hundred years behind the times; yet no one could dispute that Sicilians loved, no, they idolized children. So there was no such thing called kidnapping in Sicily. They would "invite" a rich person to be their guest, and he could not be released until he had paid room and board, as in a fine hotel.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="几百年来，绑架富人一直是西西里的家庭手工业。绑匪通常都是黑手党的恶棍，他们在绑架之前先送上一封信。这种先礼后兵的做法避免了非常麻烦的细节安排，迫使对方提前支付赎金。这就像直接支付现金进行批发就可以打折一样，可以折扣掉一笔数量可观的赎金，因为这样做免除了令人头疼的绑架的细节安排。实际上，绑架名人的事远非人们想象的那么简单。这不是那些贪得无厌、非职业绑匪或浮躁懒惰、游手好闲的无能之辈干得了的；绝对不能采用美国人那种鲁莽轻率、自杀式的做法，他们败坏了这个行当的名声。在西西里，就连“绑架4”这个词也不用，因为除非连成人一起绑来，没人会只绑架一个小孩索要赎金。你怎么说西西里人都可以：天生的罪犯，杀人如麻，像土耳其人一样狡猾奸诈，他们的社会落后时代三百年……但是有一点却是无可辩驳的：西西里人爱护儿童，不，他们简直把儿童看成了偶像。所以在西西里没有“绑架”的说法。他们会“邀请”某个富人前去做客，就像去住豪华酒店一样，但他必须支付房钱和饭钱，否则他们是不会放他走的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This was done out of prudence. History showed it was a policy that paid off. Once the prisoner was released he did not show any desire for vengeance as long as his dignity had been preserved. There was the classic case of a great Duke, who, after being released, and then leading the carabinieri to where he knew the bandits were hiding, had then paid for their defense lawyers. When despite this they were convicted, the Duke interceded to cut their long prison term in half. This was because they had treated him with such exquisite tact and politeness that the Duke declared he had never encountered such fine manners even in the highest society of Palermo.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是谨慎的做法，历史证明这种做法卓有成效。只要人质的尊严得到了维护，一旦被放了之后，他就不会有报复的念头。有一个经典的例子：一个公爵被释放后，带领宪兵到他所知道的匪徒藏身之地，把他们抓起来后，他还替他们支付辩护律师的费用。虽然他们因此被判了刑，公爵却出面求情，要求把他们的刑期减少一半。这是因为他们当时对他特别关照，特别有礼貌，公爵说，即使在巴勒莫的上流社会，他也没有见过如此得体的行为举止。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This cottage industry had developed certain rules over hundreds of years. The price was always negotiable through intermediaries such as the Mafia. There was never any violence offered to the "guest," if he cooperated. The "guest" was treated with the utmost respect, always addressed by his rank, such as Prince or Duke or Don or even Archbishop, if some bandit chose to endanger his soul by seizing a member of the cloth. Even a Member of Parliament was called Honorable to his face though everyone knew these rascals were greater thieves than anyone.</div>

<div class="line_en">Stubborn refusal or extended haggling was remedied by mild coercion. Then perhaps an ear was cut off, a finger amputated.

<div class="line_en">When Guiliano decided to enter the kidnapping business, he was determined to entertain only the richest clients in Sicily. In fact his first victim was the island's wealthiest and most powerful noble. This was Prince Ollorto, who not only had vast estates in Sicily but also a virtual empire in Brazil. He was the landlord for most of the citizens of Montelepre -- their farms and their houses. Politically he was the most powerful man behind the scenes; the Minister of Justice in Rome was a close personal friend, and the former King of Italy himself had stood godfather to the Prince's child. In Sicily the overseer for all his estates was Don Croce himself. It went without saying that the magnificent salary Don Croce was paid also included insurance payments to preserve Prince Ollorto's person from kidnappers and murderers and his jewels and cattle and sheep from thieves.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉里安诺进这一行的时候，决心只盯住有钱的西西里人。实际上，他的第一个对象就是西西里最有钱有势的贵族奥洛尔托亲王。此人不仅在西西里拥有一些大庄园，而且在巴西还拥有一个真正的王国。蒙特莱普雷大多数人家的土地——他们的农场和房屋——都是他的。从政治上来说，他是最有影响力的幕后人物。罗马政府的司法部长与他关系密切，意大利前国王是他儿子的教父，唐·克罗切是他在西西里所有庄园的监管人。毫无疑问，奥洛尔托亲王付给唐·克罗切的巨额酬金还包括保护费，用来保护他个人免遭绑架和刺杀，保护他的珠宝和牛羊免遭偷盗。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Safe in his castle, the walls guarded by Don Croce's retainers, the gatesmen, and his own personal guards, Prince Ollorto prepared for a peaceful and enjoyable evening of watching the stars in the heavens through the huge telescope which he loved more dearly than anything on earth. Suddenly there was the sound of heavy footsteps on the winding stairs that led to his observatory tower. The door crashed in and four roughly clad men holding guns filled the tiny room. The Prince covered his telescope protectively with his arm and turned away from the innocent stars to face them. When the Prince saw Terranova's ferretlike face, he offered up his prayers to God.</div>

<div class="line_en">At the side gate far down the wall an Alfa Romeo and a jeep were waiting. Prince Ollorto was thrust into the Alfa Romeo with Terranova, the others jumped into the jeep, and the two vehicles sped up the mountain road. When they were a half-hour from Palermo and a short distance from Montelepre, the cars stopped and all the men got out. There was a roadside shrine with the figure of the Madonna, and Terranova knelt briefly before it and crossed himself. The Prince, who was a religious man, suppressed the impulse to do likewise, fearing it would be taken as a sign of weakness or of supplication to these men not to harm him.

The exercise had made him ravenous, he had not felt such hunger for many years. Taking a packet of English cigarettes from his pocket, he offered them around. Terranova and each of his men took one gratefully and smoked avidly. The Prince mentally noted the fact that they did not appropriate the packet for their own use.

At one table Guiliano was reading a book by the light of an American Army battery lamp. There was a canvas bag filled with other books resting at his feet. The bag was covered with geckos and indeed there was a loud steady hum that filled the mountain air which the Prince recognized as the sound of millions of insects. It did not seem to bother Guiliano.</div>

<div class="line_en">When the Prince had finished eating Guiliano led him down a slope and into a small cave where there was a straw bed with a mattress on it. Two of the bandits following them had blankets, and the Prince was amazed to see they even had white sheets and a huge lumpy pillow. Guiliano noticed his amazement and said, "You are an honored guest and I will do everything so that you may enjoy your little vacation. If any of my men offer you any disrespect, please inform me. They have received strict instructions to treat you with all regard for your rank, and your reputation as a patriot of Sicily.

<div class="line_en">The Prince had always had a pedagogical turn of mind. And certainly in these circumstances they both had time on their hands. So he gave Guiliano a speech on how correct clothing, beautifully tailored and of the finest materials, could enrich a man such as himself. He described the tailors in London, so snobbish that they made Italian Dukes seem like Communists in comparison. He told of all the different kinds of fabrics, the great skills, the time spent in getting innumerable fittings. "My dear Guiliano," Prince Ollorto said, "it's not the money, though Saint Rosalia knows that what I paid for this suit would keep a Sicilian family for a year, and pay for their daughter's dowry too. But I have to go to London. I have to spend days with tailors who push me back and forth. It is a miserable experience. So I regret that this suit is ruined. It can never be replaced."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="亲王历来喜欢说教，现在他们两个人有的是时间。于是他跟吉里安诺大谈了一通面料上乘、做工考究、穿着得体的衣服如何能够提升一个人的气质，他自己就是个例子。他谈到伦敦的裁缝，说他们非常势利，把意大利的公爵比作共产党人。他谈到各种不同的面料、高超的手艺以及多次试穿所花的时间。“我亲爱的吉里安诺，”奥洛尔托亲王说，“这并不是钱的问题，不过圣罗沙利知道我花在这套衣服上的钱足以使西西里的一家人过上一年，而且还能给他们的女儿办嫁妆。但是我必须去伦敦。我必须花几天时间和裁缝在一起，听任他们的摆布。这是一种不愉快的经历。所以这套衣服被弄成这样我很惋惜。这是无法替代的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The second day of Prince Ollorto's kidnapping was a very pleasant one for him. There was a long but not arduous march to a deserted farmhouse deep in the mountains. Guiliano was very much the lord of the comfortable manor, as if he were a wealthy countryman honored by a surprise visit from his king.

Even now you still wear your tie though we are in the mountains. When we entered this house I noticed you buttoned your jacket as if some Duchess were waiting to greet you."</div>

<div class="line_en">Now Prince Ollorto, though he was an extreme reactionary politically, and like most of the Sicilian nobility had no sense of economic justice, had always a sense of identity with the lower classes. He felt that they were human beings like himself and no man who worked for him and minded his manners and knew his place would be left in want. The servants in his castle adored him. He treated them like members of the family. There were always gifts for their birthdays and little treats for them on the holidays. During family meals when no outside guests were present, the servants waiting on the table would join in the family discussion and give their opinions on the noble family's problems. And this was not uncommon in Italy. The lower classes were treated cruelly only when they fought for their economic rights.</div>

<div class="line_en">And now the Prince took the same attitude toward Guiliano. As if his captor were only his servant who wanted to share his life, the enviable life of a very rich and powerful man. The Prince was suddenly aware that he could turn his period of captivity into an advantage that might even make paying his ransom worthwhile. But he knew he had to be very careful. That he had to exert his charm to the utmost without any condescension. That he had to be frank and sincere and as truthful as he could be. And that he could not try to make too much capital of the situation. For Guiliano could spring from weakness to strength.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此时此刻亲王对吉里安诺也是这种态度。他觉得把他抓来的这个人是他的仆人，只不过是想分享他的生活，一个非常有钱有势的人那种令人羡慕的生活。亲王突然意识到，他可以把被绑架的这段时间变得对自己有利，这样他也不至于白白地支付赎金。但是他知道他必须非常谨慎，必须既不屈尊俯就，也要最大限度地发挥自己的魅力。他知道自己必须坦率、真诚，尽可能不要持怀疑态度。在这种情况下，他不能指望得到更多的东西，因为吉里安诺可能从弱势突然转变成强势。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So now he answered Guiliano's question seriously and with great genuineness. He said with a smile, "Why do you wear that emerald ring, that gold buckle?" He waited for an answer, but Guiliano only smiled. The Prince went on. "I married an even richer woman than myself. I have power and political duties. I have estates here in Sicily and an even larger estate in Brazil through my wife. People in Sicily kiss my hands as soon as I take them out of my pockets, and even in Rome I am held in great esteem. For in that city, money commands. Everyone's eyes are upon me. I feel ridiculous -- I have done nothing to earn all this. But it is mine to keep and I must keep it, I cannot disgrace that public person. Even when I go out hunting in what seems to be a rough garb of the countryman, I must look the part perfectly. That of a rich and great man going hunting. How I envy men like you and Don Croce sometimes, who hold your power in your head and your heart. Who have won your power by your courage and your cunning. Isn't it laughable that I do almost the same thing by going to the best tailor in London?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是奥洛尔托亲王认真、坦诚地回答了吉里安诺的问题。他笑着说：“你为什么要戴那枚祖母绿戒指，还有那个金皮带扣呢？”他等待对方回答，可是吉里安诺只是笑了笑。亲王接着说：“我娶了一个比我还有钱的女人。我有权力，也有政治责任。我在西西里有不少庄园，我通过妻子在巴西买了一座更大的庄园。在西西里，只要我把手从衣服口袋里拿出来，就会有人来吻。即使在罗马，我也有很高的声望。因为在那座城市里，金钱万能。大家的眼睛都会看着我。我觉得很奇怪——我什么也没做，何以会如此呢？但这是我要保持的，而且必须保持，因为我不可能让这样一个公众人物出丑。就连外出打猎的时候，即使我穿得像个村野陋夫，也必须保持贵族的形象，要像个外出打猎的有钱有地位的人。有时候我非常羡慕像你和唐·克罗切这样的人，把权力印在自己的头脑里，放在自己的心上。你们的权力是靠自己的勇气和智慧获得的。我去伦敦找最好的裁缝，基本上为的也是这个目的，这是不是很可笑？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And mentally too he was exhilarated. Sometimes when he was moved from place to place, Guiliano was not with the party guarding him, and he had to make conversation with men who were illiterate and ignorant of any culture. But he was surprised at their character. Most of these bandits were naturally courteous, had a native dignity, and were by no means unintelligent. They always addressed him by his rank and tried to grant his every request. He had never come so close to his fellow Sicilians before, and he was surprised to feel a renewed affection for his land and his people. The ransom, finally settled at sixty million lire in gold, was paid through Don Croce and the Abbot Manfredi. The night before his release, Prince Ollorto was given a banquet by Guiliano and his chiefs and twenty of the most important members of the band. Champagne was brought from Palermo to celebrate the occasion and they all toasted his imminent freedom, for they had grown fond of him. The Prince gave the final toast. "I have been a guest at the most noble family houses in Sicily," he said. "But I have never received such good treatment, such hospitality, or men with such exquisite manners as I have here in these mountains. I have never slept so soundly or eaten so well." He paused for a moment and said with a smile, "The bill was a little high, but good things always come dear.'' This brought a roar of laughter, Guiliano laughing loudest of all. But the Prince noticed that Pisciotta did not even smile.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他在精神上也非常愉快。有时候他随便走一走，吉里安诺不在，只有他和看护他的人在一起，他就只好和那些大字不识、没有文化的人交谈。他们的品行让他刮目相看。这些土匪中大多数人很有礼貌，淳朴而有尊严，而且一点也不愚钝。他们对他总是以公爵相称，对他的要求总是给予方便。他以前从来没有和他的西西里同胞有如此近距离的接触，他发现他对自己的故土和人民产生了新的感情。最后谈成的赎金为价值六千万里拉的黄金，通过唐·克罗切和曼弗雷迪院长来支付。在释放他的前一天晚上，吉里安诺为他举行了一次宴会，他手下的几个头领和二十个最重要的成员出席作陪。为了庆祝这一时刻，他们从巴勒莫弄来香槟，大家都祝贺他即将获得自由，因为他们都逐渐喜欢上了他。最后，亲王祝酒说：“我曾经在西西里最高贵的人家做过客，但是我从来没有受到如此盛情的款待，没有见过如此的殷勤好客，也没遇到过像这里的大山中如此有礼貌的人。我睡觉从来没有睡得这么好，我吃饭也从来没有吃得这么香。”他稍事停顿，接着又笑着说，“买单的费用是高了些，但是从来好货就不便宜嘛。”这句话引来一阵笑声，其中尤以吉里安诺的笑声最为响亮。可是亲王注意到，皮肖塔脸上没有一丝笑容。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The next morning, a Sunday, the Prince was deposited in front of the Cathedral of Palermo. He went into the church for early Mass and said a prayer of Thanksgiving. He was dressed exactly as on the day he was kidnapped. Guiliano, as a surprise and a token of his esteem, had had his English suit repaired and cleaned by the finest tailor in Rome.</div>
