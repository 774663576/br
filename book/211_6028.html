<div class="line_en">The young man first discussed with the elder his plans for the attainment of his position as a farmer on an extensive scale either in England or in the Colonies. His father then told him that, as he had not been put to the expense of sending Angel up to Cambridge, he had felt it his duty to set by a sum of money every year towards the purchase or lease of land for him some day, that he might not feel himself unduly slighted.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was not till the evening, after family prayers, that Angel found opportunity of broaching to his father one or two subjects near his heart. He had strung himself up to the purpose while kneeling behind his brothers on the carpet, studying the little nails in the heels of their walking boots. When the service was over they went out of the room with their mother, and Mr Clare and himself were left alone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一直到当天晚上家庭祈祷以后，安琪尔才找到机会把一两件心思对他的父亲说了。晚祷的时候，他跪在两个哥哥背后的地毯上，一面研究他们脚上穿的靴子后跟上的小钉子，一面在心里打定了主意。晚祷结束了，两个哥哥跟着母亲走了出去，屋子里只剩下他的父亲和他自己。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This considerateness on old Mr Clare's part led Angel onward to the other and dearer subject. He observed to his father that he was then six-and-twenty, and that when he should start in the farming business he would require eyes in the back of his head to see to all matters -- some one would be necessary to superintend the domestic labours of his establishment whilst he was afield. Would it not be well, therefore, for him to marry?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="老克莱尔先生这一方待他既是这样周到，安琪尔就趁机把另一个他更关心的问题提了出来。他对他的父亲说，他已经二十六岁了，将来在他开始农场的事业时，他的脑后需要有一双眼睛，才照顾得了所有的事情——在他照看农场的时候，家里总得有一个人，帮他管理家中的事情。因此，他应不应该结婚呢？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">'Yes; a farmer's wife; yes, certainly. It would be desirable.' Mr Clare, the elder, had plainly never thought of these points before. 'I was going to add,' he said, 'that for a pure and saintly woman you will not find more to your true advantage, and certainly not more to your mother's mind and my own, than your friend Mercy, whom you used to show a certain interest in. It is true that my neighbour Chant's daughter has lately caught up the fashion of the younger clergy round about us for decorating the Communion-table -- altar, as I was shocked to hear her call it one day -- with flowers and other stuff on festival occasions. But her father, who is quite as opposed to such flummery as I, says that can be cured. It is a mere girlish outbreak which, I am sure, will not be permanent.'</div>

But, father, don't you think that a young woman equally pure and virtuous as Miss Chant, but one who, in place of that lady's ecclesiastical accomplishments, understands the duties of farm life as well as a farmer himself, would suit me infinitely better?'</div>

<div class="line_en">His father persisted in his conviction that a knowledge of a farmer's wife's duties came second to a Pauline view of humanity; and the impulsive Angel, wishing to honour his father's feelings and to advance the cause of his heart at the same time, grew specious. He said that fate or Providence had thrown in his way a woman who possessed every qualification to be the helpmate of an agriculturist, and was decidedly of a serious turn of mind. He would not say whether or not she had attached herself to the sound Low Church School of his father; but she would probably be open to conviction on that point; she was a regular church-goer of simple faith; honest-hearted, receptive, intelligent, graceful to a degree, chaste as a vestal, and, in personal appearance, exceptionally beautiful.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的父亲坚持自己的观点，认为一个农场主的妻子首先得有保罗对待人类的眼光，其次才是种庄稼的本事；安琪尔一时受到感情的驱使，他既要尊重他的父亲的感情，同时又要促成心中的婚姻大事，所以就说了一番貌似有理的话来。他说，命运或者上帝已经给他挑选了一个姑娘，无论从哪方面说，那个姑娘都配得上做一个农业家的伴侣和帮手，也肯定具有端庄稳重的性情。他不知道她信的教是否就是他父亲信的那个合理的低教派；但是她大概会接受低教派的信仰的；她是一个信仰单纯和按时上教堂的人；她心地忠厚，感觉敏悟，头脑聪明，举止也相当高雅，她像祭祀灶神的祭司一样纯洁，容貌也长得异常的美丽。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">'Mother, I beg pardon. But as she really does attend Church almost every Sunday morning, and is a good Christian girl, I am sure you will tolerate any social shortcomings for the sake of that quality, and feel that I may do worse than choose her.' Angel waxed quite earnest on that rather automatic orthodoxy in his beloved Tess which (never dreaming that it might stand him in such good stead) he had been prone to slight when observing it practised by her and the other milkmaids, because of its obvious unreality amid beliefs essentially naturalistic.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“母亲，你听我说。每个礼拜天的早晨，她可真的都去了教堂，她是一个优秀的基督教徒，我敢肯定，她有了这种品质，你们就会容忍她在社会出身方面的缺陷了，就会认为我要是不娶她，那就是大错而特错了。”他心爱的苔丝身上的正统信仰，那完全是自发产生的，他当时看见苔丝和别的挤奶女工按时去作礼拜时，心里也是瞧不起的，因为在她们本质上是对自然崇拜的信仰里，作礼拜显然就不是诚心诚意的。可是他做梦也没有想到这一点竟会对他大有帮助，成了支持自己的理由，于是对这一点就越说越认真了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In their sad doubts as to whether their son had himself any right whatever to the title he claimed for the unknown young woman, Mr and Mrs Clare began to feel it as an advantage not to be overlooked that she at least was sound in her views; especially as the conjunction of the pair must have arisen by an act of Providence; for Angel never would have made orthodoxy a condition of his choice. They said finally that it was better not to act in a hurry, but that they would not object to see her.</div>

<div class="line_en">Angel therefore refrained from declaring more particulars now. He felt that, single-minded and self-sacrificing as his parents were, there yet existed certain latent prejudices of theirs, as middle-class people, which it would require some tact to overcome. For though legally at liberty to do as he chose, and though their daughter-in-law's qualifications could make no practical difference to their lives, in the probability of her living far away from them, he wished for affection's sake not to wound their sentiment in the most important decision of his life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因此，安琪尔现在也就对其它的细节避而不谈了。他总觉得，虽然他的父母心地单纯，有自我牺牲的精神，但是他们作为中产阶级的人，心中不免潜藏着某些偏见，这需要用点儿机智才能克服。虽然在法律上他有自由作主的权利，而且他们将来也可能要远远地离开他们生活，因此媳妇的身分就不会对父母的生活产生什么实际影响，但是为了父母的对自己的呵护，他希望在对自己一生作出最重要的决定时，不要伤害了父母的感情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He observed his own inconsistencies in dwelling upon accidents in Tess's life as if they were vital features. It was for herself that he loved Tess; her soul, her heart, her substance -- not for her skill in the dairy, her aptness as his scholar, and certainly not for her simple formal faith-professions. Her unsophisticated open-air existence required no varnish of conventionality to make it palatable to him. He held that education had as yet but little affected the beats of emotion and impulse on which domestic happiness depends. It was probable that, in the lapse of ages, improved systems of moral and intellectual training would appreciably, perhaps considerably, elevate the involuntary and even the unconscious instincts of human nature; but up to the present day culture, as far as he could see, might be said to have affected only the mental epiderm of those lives which had been brought under its influence. This belief was confirmed by his experience of women, which, having latterly been extended from the cultivated middle-class into the rural community, had taught him how much less was the intrinsic difference between the good and wise woman of one social stratum and the good and wise woman of another social stratum, than between the good and bad, the wise and the foolish, of the same stratum or class.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他在详述苔丝生活中的一些偶然事件时，把它们当成了最重要的特点，因此自己也觉得言不由衷。他爱苔丝，完全是为了苔丝自己；为了她的灵魂，为了她的心性，为了她的本质——而不是因为她有奶牛场里的技艺，有读书的才能，更不是因为她有纯洁的正统的宗教信仰。她那种天真纯朴的自然本色，无需习俗的粉饰，就能让他喜欢。他认为家庭幸福所依靠的感情和激情的搏动，教育对它们的影响是微乎其微的。经过许多个世纪以后，道德和知识训练的体系大概也有了改进，就会在一定程度上，也许在相当大的程度上提高人类天性中不自觉的、甚至是无意识的本能。但是就他看来，直到今天，也许可以说文化对于那些被置于它的影响之下的人，才在他们的表皮上产生了一点儿影响。他的这种信念，由于他同妇女接触的经验而得到证实，他同妇女的接触，近来已经从受过教育的中产阶级发展到了农村社会，并从中得出一个真理，一个社会阶层中贤惠聪明的女子和另一个社会阶层中贤惠聪明的女子，跟同一个阶层或阶级中的贤惠与凶恶、聪明与愚笨的女子比起来，她们本质上的差别是多么地小。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was the morning of his departure. His brothers had already left the vicarage to proceed on a walking tour in the north, whence one was to return to his college, and the other to his curacy. Angel might have accompanied them, but preferred to rejoin his sweetheart at Talbothays. He would have been an awkward member of the party; for, though the most appreciative humanist, the most ideal religionist, even the best-versed Christologist of the three, there was alienation in the standing consciousness that his squareness would not fit the round hole that had been prepared for him. To neither Felix nor Cuthbert had he ventured to mention Tess.</div>

<div class="line_en">This distinction, though by no means a subtle one, was yet too subtle for Mr Clare the elder, and he went on with the story he had been about to relate; which was that after the death of the senior so-called d'Urberville the young man developed the most culpable passions, though he had a blind mother, whose condition should have made him know better. A knowledge of his career having come to the ears of Mr Clare, when he was in that part of the country preaching missionary sermons, he boldly took occasion to speak to the delinquent on his spiritual state. Though he was a stranger, occupying another's pulpit, he had felt this to be his duty, and took for his text the words from St Luke: 'Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee!' The young man much resented this directness of attack, and in the war of words which followed when they met he did not scruple publicly to insult Mr Clare, without respect for his gray hairs.</div>

<div class="line_en">'We'll hope, nevertheless,' said Mr Clare. 'And I continue to pray for him, though on this side of the grave we shall probably never meet again. But, after all, one of those poor words of mine may spring up in his heart as a good seed some day.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不管怎样，我们还是希望能把他感化过来，”克莱尔先生说。“我不断地为他祈祷，虽然在这一辈子里，我们也许再也见不着面了。不过，说不定有一天，我对他说的这许多话，也许会有一句像一粒种子一样，在他的心里发芽生长。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now, as always, Clare's father was sanguine as a child; and though the younger could not accept his parent's narrow dogma he revered his practice, and recognized the hero under the pietist. Perhaps he revered his father's practice even more now than ever, seeing that, in the question of making Tessy his wife, his father had not once thought of inquiring whether she were well provided or penniless. The same unworldliness was what had necessitated Angel's getting a living as a farmer, and would probably keep his brothers in the position of poor parsons for the term of their activities; yet Angel admired it none the less. Indeed, despite his own heterodoxy, Angel often felt that be was nearer to his father on the human side than was either of his brethren.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="直到现在，克莱尔的父亲还是如同往常，像小孩子一样对什么事情都充满希望；虽然年轻的儿子不能接受那套狭隘的教条，但是他却尊敬父亲身体力行的精神，不能不承认他的父亲是一个虔诚的英雄。也许他现在比过去更加尊敬他父亲身体力行的精神了，因为他父亲在了解他同苔丝的婚事的时候，从来也没有想到要问她是富有呢还是贫穷。安琪尔正是同样拥有了这种超凡脱俗的精神，才走上了要当一个农场主的人生道路，而他的两个哥哥，大概也是因为这一点，才拥有了一个穷牧师的职位。但是安琪尔对他父亲的钦佩一点儿也没有减少。说实在的，尽管安琪尔信仰异端邪说，但是他常常觉得在做人方面，他比两个哥哥更接近父亲。">查看中文翻译</div>
