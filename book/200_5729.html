<div class="line_en">Harry had not found it an easy experience to talk about the night when Voldemort had returned. Rita had pressed him for every little detail and he had given her everything he could remember, knowing that this was his one big opportunity to tell the world the truth. He wondered how people would react to the story. He guessed that it would confirm a lot of people in the view that he was completely insane, not least because his story would be appearing alongside utter rubbish about Crumple-Horned Snorkacks. But the breakout of Bellatrix Lestrange and her fellow Death Eaters had given Harry a burning desire to do something, whether or not it worked…</div>

<div class="line_en">"Can't wait to see what Umbridge thinks of you going public," said Dean, sounding awestruck at dinner on Monday night. Seamus was shovelling down large amounts of chicken and ham pie on Dean's other side, but Harry knew he was listening.</div>

<div class="line_en">Luna said vaguely that she did not know how soon Rita's interview with Harry would appear in The Quibbler, that her father was expecting a lovely long article on recent sightings of Crumple-Horned Snorkacks, "-- and of course, that'll be a very important story, so Harry's might have to wait for the following issue," said Luna.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我缺心眼？”哈利不平地说，“前一分钟还挺好豹，下一分钟她却告诉我罗杰戴维斯约过她，还说她在那个叫人腻味的茶馆里跟塞德里克亲嘴——我能有什么感觉？”">查看中文翻译</div>

"You should have said it was really annoying, but I'd made you promise to come along to the Three Broomsticks, and you really didn't want to go, you'd much rather spend the whole day with her, but unfortunately you thought you really ought to meet me and would she please, please come along with you and hopefully you'd be able to get away more quickly.

<div class="line_en">"Harry, you're worse than Ron… well, no, you're not," she sighed, as Ron himself came stumping into the Hall splattered with mud and looking grumpy. "Look -- you upset Cho when you said you were going to meet me, so she tried to make you jealous. It was her way of trying to find out how much you liked her."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哈利，你比罗恩还差…噢，不，你要好些。”她叹了口气，此时罗恩本人正拖着沉重的身子走进礼堂。他满身泥点，好像心情很坏，“你看——你说要来见我，秋不高兴了，所以她想让你嫉妒，那是她试探你有多喜欢她的方式。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Is that what she was doing?" said Harry, as Ron dropped onto the bench opposite them and pulled every dish within reach towards him. "Well, wouldn't it have been easier if she'd just asked me whether I liked her better than you?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是吗？”哈利问，罗恩一屁股坐在对面的凳子上，把所有够得到的盘子都拖到他面前，“她为什么不直接问我更喜欢谁，那不是简单得多吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The very best thing you could say about the match was that it was short; the Gryffindor spectators had to endure only twenty-two minutes of agony. It was hard to say what the worst thing was: Harry thought it was a close-run contest between Ron's fourteenth failed save, Sloper missing the Bludger but hitting Angelina in the mouth with his bat, and Kirke shrieking and falling backwards off his broom when Zacharias Smith zoomed at him carrying the Quaffle. The miracle was that Gryffindor only lost by ten points: Ginny managed to snatch the Snitch from right under Hufflepuff Seeker Summerby's nose, so that the final score was two hundred and forty versus two hundred and thirty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这场比赛惟一的好处就是时间短，格兰芬多的观众只需忍受二十二分钟的痛苦。很难说最糟糕的是哪一个，哈利认为难分上下：罗恩十四次扑漏球；斯劳珀没打到游走球，一棍抽到了安吉利娜的嘴巴上；看到扎卡赖斯史密斯带着鬼飞球冲过来，柯克尖叫一声，仰面摔下了扫帚。奇迹是格兰芬多队只输了十分：金妮在赫奇帕奇找球手夏比的鼻子底下抓住了飞贼，最后比分是二百四十比二百三十。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry was a hero in the Gryffindor common room that night. Daringly, Fred and George had put an Enlargement Charm on the front cover of The Quibbler and hung it on the wall, so that Harry's giant head gazed down upon the proceedings, occasionally saying things like "THE MINISTRY ARE MORONS" and "EAT DUNG, UMBRIDGE" in a booming voice. Hermione did not find this very amusing; she said it interfered with her concentration, and she ended up going to bed early out of irritation. Harry had to admit that the poster was not quite as funny after an hour or two, especially when the talking spell had started to wear off, so that it merely shouted disconnected words like "DUNG" and "UMBRIDGE" at more and more frequent intervals in a progressively higher voice. In fact, it started to make his head ache and his scar began prickling uncomfortably again. To disappointed moans from the many people who were sitting around him, asking him to relive his interview for the umpteenth time, he announced that he too needed an early night.</div>

I mean, the shock of whatever happened when he touched that weapon probably made the Imperius Curse lift. Once he'd got his voice back, he'd explain what he'd been doing, wouldn't he?

<div class="line_en">The week did not improve as it progressed. Harry received two more "Ds in Potions; he was still on tenterhooks that Hagrid might get the sack; and he couldn't stop himself dwelling on the dream in which he had been Voldemort -- though he didn't bring it up with Ron and Hermione again; he didn't want another telling-off from Hermione. He wished very much that he could have talked to Sirius about it, but that was out of the question, so he tried to push the matter to the back of his mind.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I don't know," said Harry, getting wearily to his feet. He was finding it increasingly difficult to disentangle separate memories from the rush of images and sound that Snape kept calling forth. "You mean the one where my cousin tried to make me stand in the toilet?"</div>

Harry pushed forwards through a knot of tall Slytherins and saw that the onlookers had formed a great ring, some of them looking shocked, others even frightened.

Two large trunks lay on the floor beside her, one of them upside-down; it looked very much as though it had been thrown down the stairs after her.

What he had been doing out in the grounds Harry could not imagine, but there was something impressive about the sight of him framed in the doorway against an oddly misty night. Leaving the doors wide open behind him he strode forwards through the circle of onlookers towards Professor Trelawney, tear-stained and trembling, on her trunk, Professor McGonagall alongside her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="栎木大门打开了，门边的学生赶忙闪开，邓布利多出现在门口。哈利想象不出他在外面做什么，但他站在门框中，衬着雾霭缭绕的夜色，有一种威严之感。他让大门敞开着，大步穿过人群走向特里劳妮教授。她还坐在箱子上。满脸泪痕，浑身发抖，麦格教授陪着她。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">To Harry's very great surprise, Dumbledore continued to smile. He looked down at Professor Trelawney, who was still sobbing and choking on her trunk, and said, "You are quite right, of course, Professor Umbridge. As High Inquisitor you have every right to dismiss my teachers. You do not, however, have the authority to send them away from the castle. I am afraid," he went on, with a courteous little bow, "that the power to do that still resides with the Headmaster, and it is my wish that Professor Trelawney continue to live at Hogwarts."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="令哈利大为惊讶的是，邓布利多仍然面带微笑。他低头看着还在箱子上抽泣的特里劳妮教授，说道：“您说的当然对，乌姆里奇教授。作为最高调查官您完全有权解雇我的教师。但是，您恐怕无权将他们逐出城堡，这个权力恐怕——”他礼貌地欠了欠身说，“还属于校长，我希望特里劳妮教授继续住在霍格沃茨。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Professor Sprout came hurrying forwards out of the crowd and grabbed Professor Trelawney's other arm. Together, they guided her past Umbridge and up the marble stairs. Professor Flitwick went scurrying after them, his wand held out before him; he squeaked "Locomotor trunks!" and Professor Trelawney's luggage rose into the air and proceeded up the staircase after her, Professor Flitwick bringing up the rear.</div>
