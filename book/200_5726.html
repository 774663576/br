<div class="line_en">Was this why Dumbledore would no longer meet Harry's eyes? Did he expect to see Voldemort staring out of them, afraid, perhaps, that their vivid green might turn suddenly to scarlet, with catlike slits for pupils? Harry remembered how the snakelike face of Voldemort had once forced itself out of the back of Professor Quirrell's head and ran his hand over the back of his own, wondering what it would feel like if Voldemort burst out of his skull.</div>

<div class="line_en">I'm the weapon, Harry thought, and it was as though poison were pumping through his veins, chilling him, bringing him out in a sweat as he swayed with the train through the dark tunnel. I'm the one Voldemort's trying to use, that's why they've got guards around me everywhere I go, it's not for my protection, it's for other people's, only it's not working, they can't have someone on me all the time at Hogwarts… I did attack Mr. Weasley last night, it was me. Voldemort made me do it and he could be inside me, listening to my thought's right now --"</div>

<div class="line_en">He nodded; here was a ready-made excuse not to talk to any of the others, which was precisely what he wanted, so when she opened the front door he hurried straight past the trolls-leg umbrella stand, up the stairs and into his and Ron's bedroom.</div>

Perhaps he was an Animagus… no, he couldn't be, he would know… perhaps Voldemort was an Animagus… yes, thought Harry, that would fit, he would turn into a snake of course… and when he's possessing me, then we both transform… that still doesn't explain how I got to London and back to my bed in the space of about five minutes… but then Voldemort's about the most powerful wizard in the world, apart from Dumbledore, it's probably no problem at all to him to transport people like that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他是怎么变成蛇的？也许他是阿尼马格斯…不，不可能，他会知道的…也许伏地魔是阿尼马格斯…对，哈利想，这就说得通了，他当然能变成一条蛇…当他附在我身上时，我们都变成蛇…可这还不能解释我怎么会在五分钟之内去了伦敦又回到床上…但除了邓布利多之外，伏地魔几乎是世界上最厉害的巫师，把人运来运去对他来说可能不成问题…">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was only one thing for it: he would have to leave Grimmauld Place straightaway. He would spend Christmas at Hogwarts without the others, which would keep them safe over the holidays at least… but no, that wouldn't do, there were still plenty of people at Hogwarts to maim and injure. What if it was Seamus, Dean or Neville next time? He stopped his pacing and stood staring at Phineas Nigellus's empty frame. A leaden sensation was settling in the pit of his stomach. He had no alternative: he was going to have to return to Privet Drive, cut himself off from other wizards entirely.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="只有一个办法：他必须马上离开格里莫广场。他要在霍格沃茨一个人过圣诞节，这样至少可以在节日期间保证他们的安全…不行，还是没有用，霍格沃茨也有许多人可以伤害，如果下一个是西莫、迪安或纳威呢？他停止了踱步，望着菲尼亚斯。奈杰勒斯的空画框，肚子里像灌了铅。他别无选择，只有回女贞路，同其他巫师彻底隔离…">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Well, if he had to do it, he thought, there was no point hanging around. Trying with all his might not to think how the Dursleys were going to react when they found him on their doorstep six months earlier than they had expected, he strode over to his trunk, slammed the lid shut and locked it, then glanced around automatically for Hedwig before remembering that she was still at Hogwarts -- well, her cage would be one less thing to carry -- he seized one end of his trunk and had dragged it halfway towards the door when a snide voice said, "Running away, are we?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="好吧，他想，如果必须走，再耽搁已经没有意义。他竭力不去想象德思礼一家看见他提前六个月回来了会有什么反应，大步走到他的箱子跟前，关上盖子，锁好，然后习惯性地回头我海德薇，这才想起它还在霍格沃茨——也好，少拎一个笼子。他提起箱子的一头，把它向门口拖去，忽听一个尖厉的声音说道：“想逃，是不是？”">查看中文翻译</div>

Have you never paused, while feeling hard-done-by, to note that following Dumbledore's orders has never yet led you into harm?

<div class="line_en">Everybody else spent the following morning putting up Christmas decorations. Harry could not remember Sirius ever being in such a good mood; he was actually singing carols, apparently delighted that he was to have company over Christmas. Harry could hear his voice echoing up through the floor in the cold drawing room where he was sitting alone, watching the sky growing whiter outside the windows, threatening snow, all the time feeling a savage pleasure that he was giving the others the opportunity to keep talking about him, as they were bound to be doing. When he heard Mrs. Weasley calling his name softly up the stairs around lunchtime, he retreated further upstairs and ignored her.</div>

Assuming that Mundungus or some other Order member had come to call, Harry merely settled himself more comfortably against the wall of Buckbeak's room where he was hiding, trying to ignore how hungry he felt as he fed dead rats to the hippogriff. It came as a slight shock when somebody hammered hard on the door a few minutes later.</div>

Mum and Dad are a bit disappointed, but I've told them that everyone who is serious about the exams is staying at Hogwarts to study. They want me to do well, they'll understand.

<div class="line_en">How could he have dreamed of returning to Privet Drive for Christmas? Sirius's delight at having the house full again, and especially at having Harry back, was infectious. He was no longer their sullen host of the summer; now he seemed determined that everyone should enjoy themselves as much, if not more than they would have done at Hogwarts, and he worked tirelessly in the run-up to Christmas Day, cleaning and decorating with their help, so that by the time they all went to bed on Christmas Eve the house was barely recognisable. The tarnished chandeliers were no longer hung with cobwebs but with garlands of holly and gold and silver streamers; magical snow glittered in heaps over the threadbare carpets; a great Christmas tree, obtained by Mundungus and decorated with live fairies, blocked Sirius's family tree from view, and even the stuffed elf-heads on the hall wall wore Father Christmas hats and beards.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他怎么会想回女贞路过圣诞节呢？小天狼星的快乐是有传染性的。小天狼星因为家里又住满了人而高兴，哈利的回来尤其让他高兴。他不再是夏天那个阴沉的主人了，现在他似乎决心要让每个人都像在霍格沃茨一样开心，如果不是更开心的话。他不知疲倦地为过节做准备，在大家的帮助下打扫和装饰房间。圣诞节前夜他们上床睡觉时，家里简直都认不出来了。生锈的吊灯上挂的不再是蜘蛛网，而是冬青和金银彩带，魔法变出的雪花亮晶晶地堆在破地毯上，蒙顿格斯搞来的一棵大圣诞树挡住了小天狼星的家谱，上面装饰着活的精灵，就连门厅墙上摆放的那些小精灵脑袋上也戴了圣诞老人的帽子和胡子。">查看中文翻译</div>

Harry flicked through the first volume eagerly; he could see it was going to be highly useful in his plans for the DA. Hagrid had sent a furry brown wallet that had fangs, which were presumably supposed to be an anti-theft device, but unfortunately prevented Harry putting any money in without getting his fingers ripped off. Tonks's present was a small, working model of a Firebolt, which Harry watched fly around the room, wishing he still had his full-size version; Ron had given him an enormous box of Every-Flavour Beans, Mr. and Mrs. Weasley the usual hand-knitted jumper and some mince pies, and Dobby a truly dreadful painting that Harry suspected had been done by the elf himself. He had just turned it upside-down to see whether it looked better that way when, with a loud crack, Fred and George Apparated at the foot of his bed.</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry peered inside. Most of the cupboard was taken up with a very large and old-fashioned boiler, but in the foot of space underneath the pipes Kreacher had made himself something that looked like a nest. A jumble of assorted rags and smelly old blankets were piled on the floor and the small dent in the middle of it showed where Kreacher curled up to sleep every night. Here and there among the material were stale bread crusts and mouldy old bits of cheese. In a far corner glinted small objects and coins that Harry guessed Kreacher had saved, magpie-like, from Sirius's purge of the house, and he had also managed to retrieve the silver-framed family photographs that Sirius had thrown away over the summer. Their glass might be shattered, but still the little black-and-white people inside them peered up at him haughtily, including -- he felt a little jolt in his stomach -- the dark, heavy-lidded woman whose trial he had witnessed in Dumbledore's Pensieve: Bellatrix Lestrange. By the looks of it, hers was Kreacher's favourite photograph; he had placed it to the fore of all the others and had mended the glass clumsily with Spellotape.</div>

<div class="line_en">Once they had eaten their Christmas lunch, the Weasleys, Harry and Hermione were planning to pay Mr. Weasley another visit, escorted by Mad-Eye and Lupin. Mundungus turned up in time for Christmas pudding and trifle, having managed to 'borrow' a car for the occasion, as the Underground did not run on Christmas Day. The car, which Harry doubted very much had been taken with the consent of its owner, had been enlarged with a spell like the Weasleys' old Ford Anglia had once been. Although normally proportioned outside, ten people with Mundungus driving were able to fit into it quite comfortably. Mrs. Weasley hesitated before getting inside -- Harry knew her disapproval of Mundungus was battling with her dislike of travelling without magic -- but, finally, the cold outside and her children's pleading triumphed, and she settled herself into the back seat between Fred and Bill with good grace.</div>

<div class="line_en">"This is our long-term residents' ward," she informed Harry, Ron, Hermione and Ginny in a low voice. "For permanent spell damage, you know. Of course, with intensive remedial potions and charms and a bit of luck, we can produce some improvement. Gilderoy does seem to be getting back some sense of himself; and we've seen a real improvement in Mr. Bode, he seems to be regaining the power of speech very well, though he isn't speaking any language we recognise yet. Well, I must finish giving out the Christmas presents, I'll leave you all to chat."</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry looked around. The ward bore unmistakeable signs of being a permanent home to its residents. They had many more personal effects around their beds than in Mr Weasley's ward; the wall around Gilderoy's headboard, for instance, was papered with pictures of himself, all beaming toothily and waving at the new arrivals. He had autographed many of them to himself in disjointed, childish writing. The moment he had been deposited in his chair by the Healer, Gilderoy pulled a fresh stack of photographs towards him, seized a quill and started signing them all feverishly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利打量着这间病房，它显然是病人长住的家。病床周围的私用物品比韦斯莱先生那边多得多。吉德罗的床头板上贴着他自己的照片，都在向新来者露齿微笑，挥手致意。许多照片上有他笔画幼稚的签名。他刚被治疗师按到椅子上，就拉过一沓照片，抓起羽毛笔，狂热地签起名来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You can put them in envelopes," he said to Ginny, throwing the signed pictures into her lap one by one as he finished them. "I am not forgotten, you know, no, I still receive a very great deal of fan mail… Gladys Gudgeon writes weekly… I just wish I knew why…" He paused, looking faintly puzzled, then beamed again and returned to his signing with renewed vigour. "I suspect it is simply my good looks…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你可以把它们放在信封里，”他对金妮说，把签好的照片一张张扔到她膝上，“我没被遗忘，没有，我仍然收到许多崇拜者的来信…格拉迪丝古吉翁每周都写…我真搞不懂为什么…”他停了下来，似乎有点困惑，随即又露出笑容，起劲地签起名来，“我想只是因为我相貌英俊…”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A sallow-skinned, mournful-looking wizard lay in the bed opposite staring at the ceiling; he was mumbling to himself and seemed quite unaware of anything around him. Two beds along was a woman whose entire head was covered in fur; Harry remembered something similar happening to Hermione during their second year, although fortunately the damage, in her case, had not been permanent. At the far end of the ward flowery curtains had been drawn around two beds to give the occupants and their visitors some privacy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一个面色灰黄、愁眉苦脸的男巫躺在对面床上，盯着天花板自言自语，仿佛对周围事物不知不觉。隔了两张床是一个满脸长毛的女人，哈利想起二年级时赫敏也有过类似的经历，幸好她的损容不是永久性的。病房另一头的两张床有花帘子围着，给病人和探视者一些隐私。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"And look, Broderick, you've been sent a pot plant and a lovely calendar with a different fancy hippogriff for each month; they'll brighten things up, won't they?" said the Healer, bustling along to the mumbling man, setting a rather ugly plant with long, swaying tentacles on the bedside cabinet and fixing the calendar to the wall with her wand. "And -- oh, Mrs. Longbottom, are you leaving already?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“布罗德里克，你看，有人送给你一盆植物，还有一个漂亮的日历，每个月是不同的鹰头马身有翼兽，会带给你好心情的，是不是？”治疗师快步走到自言自语的男子跟前，把一盆怪难看的植物放在他的床头柜上，又用魔杖把日历挂到墙上，那植物上的长触手摆来摆去。“还有——哦，隆巴顿夫人，您这就走吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

The curtains had been drawn back from the two beds at the end of the ward and two visitors were walking back down the aisle between the beds: a formidable-looking old witch wearing a long green dress, a moth-eaten fox fur and a pointed hat decorated with what was unmistakeably a stuffed vulture and, trailing behind her looking thoroughly depressed -- Neville.</div>

<div class="line_en">With a sudden rush of understanding, Harry realised who the people in the end beds must be.
