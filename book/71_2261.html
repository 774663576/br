<div class="line_en">"My dear Count," he said, "you see me prey to an anxiety, which is that the cuisine of the Rue du Helder may not please you as much as that of the Piazza di Spagna. I should have enquired about your taste and had some dishes prepared to suit your fancies."</div>

<div class="line_en">"If you knew me better, Monsieur," the count replied with a smile, "you would not concern yourself with an attention which is almost humiliating for a traveller who has lived in turn with macaroni in Naples, polenta in Milan, olla podrida in Valencia, pilaff in Constantinople, curry in India and birds' nests in China. There is no such thing as a cuisine for a cosmopolitan like myself. I eat everything, everywhere, but little. And today, when you reproach me with my abstinence, I am in fact indulging my appetite, for I have not eaten since yesterday morning."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Indeed, yes," said Monte Cristo. "There's no secret. It is a mixture of excellent opium which I brought myself from Canton so that I could be certain it was pure, and the best hashish harvested in the East, namely that which comes from between the Tigris and the Euphrates. These two ingredients are mixed in equal proportions and shaped into pills which can be taken when needed. The result follows within ten minutes. Ask Baron Franz d'Epinay; I think he tried it once."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“噢，可以的，”基督山答道，“我并不想保守秘密。那是上等鸦片和最好的大麻精的一种混合剂。鸦片是我从广东买来的，可保证它的质地纯粹，大麻精是东方的产品——那就是说，是在提格雷和幼发拉底河之间生长的。这两种成份用相等的份量混合起来，制成丸药，吞下一颗以后，十分钟就可见效。这一点可问问弗兰士·伊辟楠男爵阁下，我记得他曾吃过一次的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No, Monsieur. I do not entrust my real pleasures to unworthy hands. I am a good enough chemist to prepare the pills myself."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“噢，不，阁下，”基督山答道，“我不会把我真正心爱的享受品信托给无能的人去随意乱搞。我勉强可以算是一个药剂师，我的丸药是我亲自调制的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes," Morcerf replied. "He mentioned it to me and has a very pleasant memory of the occasion."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，”马瑟夫回答，“他对我说过这样的事。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Not at all, Monsieur," said the count; and he took out of his pocket a wonderful pillbox formed out of a single emerald and closed by a gold screw which, when it was loosened, allowed to emerge a small, greenish ball, about the size of a pea. The ball had a pervasive, acrid smell. There were four or five others like it inside the emerald, which might have been able to contain a dozen of them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，阁下。”伯爵回答，于是他从衣袋里摸出一只非常名贵的小盒子，那是整块翡翠镂刻成的，上面有一个金质的盖子，盖子一转，就从里面倒出一粒淡绿色的小丸子，约莫有豌豆大小。这粒丸子有一股辛辣刺鼻的香味。翡翠盒子里还有四五粒，它本来的容量大概在一打左右。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"And do you always carry this drug with you?" asked Beauchamp who, as a journalist, was very incredulous.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I had three like that," Monte Cristo went on. "I gave one to the sultan, who had it mounted on his sword. I gave the second to our Holy Father the Pope, who had it encrusted into his tiara opposite an emerald that was more or less similar, though not so beautiful, which had been given to his predecessor, Pius VII, by the Emperor Napoleon. I kept the third for myself and had it hollowed out, thus diminishing its value by half, but fitting it better for the use I wished to make of it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我有三块同样的，”基督山答道。“一块我送给了土耳其皇帝，他拿来镶在他的佩刀上，另外一块送给我们的圣父教皇，他拿来和拿破仑皇帝送给他的前任庇护七世的那一块一同镶在他的冠冕上，他原来的那一块差不多也有这样大，但质地没有这样好。这第三块我留给自己，我把它镂空了，虽然减低了它的价值，但用起来却的确非常方便。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Monsieur le Comte, you have no idea how much pleasure I feel in hearing you say that!" said Morcerf. "I had already let my friends know in advance that you were a fabulous being, like an enchanter from the Thousand and One Nights, or a sorcerer of the Middle Ages; but Parisians are people whose wits are so used to paradoxes that they mistake the most undeniable truths for mere figments of the imagination if these truths do not conform in every respect to the conditions of their daily lives. For example, Debray here reads and Beauchamp prints day by day that a late-returning member of the Jockey Club has been stopped and robbed on the boulevards; that four people have been murdered in the Rue Saint-Denis or the Faubourg Saint-Germain; and that ten, fifteen or twenty thieves have been arrested in a café on the Boulevard du Temple, or in the Thermes de Julien; yet they still deny the existence of bandits in the Maremma, the Roman Campagna or the Pontine marshes. So tell them yourself, I beg you, Monsieur le Comte, how I was captured by those bandits and that, in all probability, without your generous intervention I should today be awaiting my eternal resurrection in the Catacombs of Saint Sebastian, instead of giving them dinner in my unworthy little house in the Rue du Helder."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“伯爵阁下，您不知道您这些话我听了多高兴，”马瑟夫说。“我事先已向我这几位朋友宣称过，说您是《一千〇一夜》里的一位魔法家，中世纪的一个术士，但巴黎人诡辩起来倒是十分精明，假如那种事实不是他们的日常生活里所遇到的话，那他们会把最无可争辩的事实误认作狂想。譬如说，骑士俱乐部的一个会员在大街上被拦劫啦；圣·但尼街或圣·日尔曼村有四个人被暗杀啦；寺院大道或九龄路的一家咖啡馆里捉到了十个，十五个，或二十个小偷啦；这一类新闻，狄布雷天天看到，波香天天刊登——可是，他们却拚命说马里曼丛林，罗马平原，或邦汀沼泽地带的强盗是不存在的。请您当面告诉他们，我的确被强盗绑去过，要不是您仗义搭救，我现在早已睡在圣·西伯斯坦的陵墓里，而决不能再在海尔达路我这间寒舍里接待他们啦。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“那很公道。”基督山回答。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, then, even at the expense of my vanity," Morcerf proceeded, "for three days I thought myself to be the object of the coquetry of a masked lady whom I took for some descendant of Tullia or Poppaea, when in fact I was purely and simply the victim of the provocative manoeuvres of a contadina -- and note that I say contadina, to avoid calling her a peasant. All that I do know is that, naïve as I was -- still more naïve than the person I just mentioned -- I mistook for this same peasant girl a young bandit of fifteen or sixteen, beardless, narrow waisted, who at the very moment when I wanted to take the liberty of planting a kiss on his chaste shoulder put a pistol to my throat and, with the help of seven or eight of his companions, led me, or dragged me, into the depths of the Catacombs of Saint Sebastian, where I met a very cultured chief bandit who, dammit, was reading Caesar's Commentaries, but deigned to interrupt his reading to tell me that if, on the following morning at six o'clock, I had not put four thousand écus into his coffers, then on the same day at a quarter past six I should quite simply have ceased to exist. There is a letter to prove it, in the possession of Franz, signed by me with a postscript by Luigi Vampa. If you doubt my word, I can write to Franz, who will verify the signatures. That is all I know. Now, what I do not know is how you, Monsieur le Comte, managed to inspire so much respect in these Roman bandits who respect so little else. I must admit to you that Franz and I were totally overcome with admiration."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好，”马瑟夫说，“接连三天，我自以为已成了一个蒙面女郎垂顾的目标，我把那个垂顾我的人认作是杜丽亚①或包贝②的后裔，而实际上她是化装成一个农家女，我说农家女，是为了避免说农妇。我只知道自己象是一个傻瓜，一个大傻瓜，我错把这个下巴上没有胡须，腰肢纤细，年约十五六岁的青年强盗看作是一个农家女，而正当我想在他的嘴唇上尊敬地吻一下时，他忽然拿出一支手枪抵住我的脑袋，另外还有七八支手枪过来帮忙，于是把我领到，或说得更准确些，是把我拖到圣·西伯斯坦的陵墓里。在那儿，我发现一位受过高深教育的强盗正在那儿阅读《凯撒历史回忆录》，蒙他弃书赐教，告诉我说，除非我在第二天早晨六点钟以前献四千毕阿士特到他的钱柜里，否则到六点一刻我就活不成了。那封信现在还可以看得到，因为弗兰士·伊辟楠还把它藏着，上面有我的签名，有罗杰·范巴先生的批语。我所知道的就这些了，但我不知道，伯爵阁下，您究竟怎么能使这些天不怕地不怕的罗马强盗这样尊敬您。我向您说实话，弗兰士和我的确都佩服极啦。”【注：①杜丽亚是罗马第六代国王的女儿。②包贝是罗马国王尼罗的妻子。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Nothing could be simpler, Monsieur," the count replied. "I had known the celebrated Vampa for more than ten years. One day, when he was quite young and still a shepherd, I gave him some gold coin or other because he had shown me the way and, so that he would not be indebted to me, he gave me in return a dagger which he had carved and which you must have seen in my collection of weapons. Later, either because he had forgotten this small exchange of presents between us or because he did not recognize me, he tried to arrest me, but I turned the tables on him and captured him myself with a dozen of his men. I might have delivered him to the justice of Rome, which is swift and would have been even more expeditious in his case, but I did not. Instead I let him and his followers go."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“说来简单极了，”伯爵答道。“我认识那位大名鼎鼎的范巴已有十几年了。当他还只是一个孩子，还只是一个牧童的时候，给我领了一段路，为此我曾送他几块金洋。他呢，为了要报答我，就送了我一把匕首，那把匕首的柄是他亲手雕刻的，你们要是去参观我搜集的武器，还可以看得到。本来，这一次交换礼物，应该可以巩固我们的友谊，但到后来，不知他究竟把这件事忘了呢，还是记不得我了，他想来捉我，但结果倒反而是我捉住了他，还把他的羽党也捉了一打。我本来可以把他交给罗马法院，法院方面大概也是欢迎的，尤其是他，但我并没有那样做——我把他和他的羽党都放了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No, Monsieur," Monte Cristo replied. "On the simple condition that they would always respect me and mine. Perhaps what I am about to say will appear strange to you gentlemen, socialists, progressives, humanitarians as you are, but I never worry about my neighbour, I never try to protect society which does not protect me -- indeed, I might add, which generally takes no heed of me except to do me harm -- and, since I hold them low in my esteem and remain neutral towards them, I believe that society and my neighbour are in my debt."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，阁下，”基督山回答，“我的条件只是应该尊敬我和我的朋友。你们之中要是有社会主义者，以宣扬人道和对你们邻居的尊敬为荣的，那么对于下面所要说的这一番话或许会觉得奇怪，但我从来不想去保护社会，社会并没有保护我，我甚至可以说，一般而论，它只想来伤害我，所以我对于它们的敬意很低，对它们保持着一种中立的态度，不是我负社会和我的邻居，是社会和我的邻居负了我。”">查看中文翻译</div>

"Here you are, caught in a logical argument -- you, possessor of one of the most rigidly logical minds I have ever encountered; and you will see what is about to be clearly demonstrated to you, namely that, far from being an egoist, you are on the contrary a philanthropist. Oh, Count! You call yourself an Oriental, a Levantine, a Malay, an Indian, a Chinese, a Savage; you use Monte Cristo as your family name and Sinbad the Sailor as your Christian name; and yet, look what happens on the very day you set foot in Paris: instinctively you possess the finest and the worst quality of us eccentric Parisians, which is to lay claim to the vices that you do not have and to hide the virtues that you do!"</div>

<div class="line_en">"I shall keep it," said Morcerf. "But I am afraid that you will be very disappointed, my dear Count, accustomed as you are to mountainous terrain, picturesque events and fabulous horizons. Here, you will encounter not the slightest excitement of the kind to which your adventurous life has accustomed you. Our Chimborazzo is Montmartre, our Himalayas, the Mont Valérien, and our Great Desert, the Plaine de Grenelle: indeed, they are digging an artesian well there, for the caravans to have water. We do have thieves, quite a few as it happens, though not as many as people say; but these thieves fear the meanest copper's nark infinitely more than they do the greatest peer of the realm. Finally, France is such a prosaic country and Paris such a highly civilized city that in all our eighty-five départements -- I say eighty-five, because of course I do not count Corsica as a part of France -- in all our eighty-five départements you will not find the smallest mountain without its telegraph or a single cave with the least blackness inside it, in which some police commissioner has not put a gaslight. So, my dear Count, there is only one service that I can perform for you, and I am entirely at your disposal: it goes without saying that I shall introduce you everywhere, or have you introduced by my friends. In any case, you have no need of that: your name, your fortune and your wit" (Monte Cristo bowed with a faintly ironic smile) "will mean that you can present yourself anywhere with no further introduction, and be well received. In reality, there is only one way in which I can serve you. If my experience of Parisian life and its comforts, or my acquaintance with the market, may recommend me to you, then I am at your disposal to find you a suitable house. I would not dare to offer to let you share my lodgings as I shared yours in Rome -- I who do not profess egoism but am a perfect egoist; for here there is no room to house even a shadow apart from myself, unless it were the shadow of a woman."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我一定守信用，”马瑟夫回答说，“但我恐怕您见惯了奇事美景，对这里会大感失望。在我们这里，您遇不到任何在您的冒险生活里常常遇到的那种插曲。马特山就是我们的琴博拉索①，凡尔灵山就是我们的喜马拉雅，格勒内尔平原就是我们的戈壁大沙漠，而且他们现在正在那儿掘一口喷水井，以便沙漠里的旅客有水吃。我们有不少小偷，虽然倒没有报上说的那样多，但这些小偷怕警察甚于怕失主。法国是这样平淡无奇，巴黎是这样文明的一个都市，以致在它的八十五省境内——我说八十五，因为我没有把科西嘉包括进去——嗯，在这八十五省境内，您不会在哪一座小山上找不到一座急报房②，或哪一个岩洞里找不到一盏警察局安放的煤气灯。我只有一件事可以为您效劳，听您的吩咐，就是，由我或请我的朋友到处为您介绍。而且，您也无须乎要人为您介绍——凭您的大名、您的财富和您的天才，（基督山带着一个近于讽刺意味的微笑鞠了一躬）您可以到处自荐而受到很好的接待。我只有在一点上可以对您有用，假如在熟悉巴黎生活的习惯，使日子过得安乐舒适，或采办衣物用具这几方面，我的经验对您能有所帮助的话，您可以差遣我为您去找一所适当的住宅。我在罗马分享您的住处，但我不敢请您分享我的住处——虽然我并不主张利己主义，但我却是个出色的利己主义者——因为除了我本人以外，这些房间连一个影子也容纳不下，除非是一个女人的影子。”【注：①琴博拉索是火山名，拔海二〇四九八呎，在南美洲。②当时还没有发明电报，但每隔相当距离，在地势较高处设一座急报房，遇有紧急消息以各种信号辗转传达，比驿马还快，这种制度在形式上颇似中国的烽火台。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"My dear Vicomte," said Monte Cristo, "I can see not a single word in all that I have said or done to merit the supposed praise that I have just received from you and from these gentlemen. You were not a stranger to me: I knew you, for I had relinquished two rooms to you, I had given you lunch, I had lent you one of my carriages, we had watched the masks go past together in the Corso and we watched out of a window in the Piazza del Popolo that execution which had such a strong effect on you that you were almost taken ill by it. I appeal to all these gentlemen: could I leave my guest in the hands of those frightful bandits, as you call them? In any case, I had, as you know, a personal interest in saving you, which was to use you to introduce me into polite society in Paris when I came to France. At one time you may have considered that intention as merely a vague and fleeting project; but today, as you see, it is entirely real and you must submit, or else fail to keep your word."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我亲爱的子爵，”基督山答道，“我看不出在我所做的哪件事上有什么地方能值得您或这几位先生如此过奖。您和我不是陌路人，因为我已经跟您相识了。我曾让了两个房间给您，我曾请您和我共过早餐，我曾借给您一辆马车；我们曾一同看狂欢节；我们也曾在波波罗广场的一个窗口上一同看杀人，那次吓得您几乎要昏过去。我请这几位先生说句公道话，我能让我的客人由那个您所谓的可怕的强盗去任意摆布吗？而且，您知道，我曾想过，当我到法国来的时候，您可以介绍我踏进巴黎的几家客厅。您以前或许把我这个决定看作一个空泛渺茫的计划，但今天您已经看到这是一件实实在在的事情了，这件事，您要是不守信用，是一定要受罚的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

"Although a Liberal by instinct, he arranged a loan of six million francs in 1829 for King Charles X, who made him a baron, no less, and knight of the Legion of Honour, which means that he wears the ribbon, not, as you might think, in the buttonhole of his waistcoat, but quite plainly on his coat itself."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“贡献大极了，”波香回答说。“虽然身为自由党，他却在一八二九年为查理十世①谈成了一笔六百万的借款，而查理十世就封了他一名男爵，并赏他荣誉爵士的衔头②，所以他也挂起勋章来了，只是，并不如您所想的挂在他的背心上，而是挂在他的纽孔上。”【注：①查理十世（1757－1836），法国国王。②荣誉爵士是爵位中最低的一级。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“啊！”马瑟夫大笑着插进来说，“波香，波香，这篇材料你留给滑稽画报吧，但别当着我的面来挖苦我未来的岳父。”然后，他转向基督山，“您刚才提到他的名字，您认识男爵了？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I don't," Monte Cristo said in an offhand manner, "but it seems likely that I shall shortly make his acquaintance, since I have a credit opened on him by the firms of Richard and Blount of London, Arnstein and Eskeles in Vienna and Thomson and French in Rome."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我并不认识他，”基督山回答，“但我不久大概就可以认识他，因为我经伦敦理查·勃龙银行，维也纳阿斯丹·爱斯克里斯银行，罗马汤姆生·弗伦奇银行的介绍，要在他的银行里开一个透支户头。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As he spoke the last two names, Monte Cristo looked out of the corner of his eye at Maximilien Morrel.

<div class="line_en">"The Boulevard de l'Opéra," said Beauchamp. "On the first floor, an apartment with a balcony.

He is an excellent fellow who was something of a soldier, something of a smuggler and, in short, a little of all that one can be. I would not swear to it that he has not been in trouble with the police over some trifle -- like a knifing, say."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，您那天光临的时候见过他。他当过兵，当过走私贩子——事实上，什么都干过。我不十分清楚他究竟有没有和警察局发生过小麻烦——譬如说，用一把小刀子戳人之类的事。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, then," said Château-Renaud, "you have a household all ready: a mansion on the Champs-Elysées, servants, a butler; the only thing lacking is a mistress."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那末，”夏多·勒诺又说，“既然您已安排妥当，有了一位管家，又有一所座落在香榭丽榭大道①的大厦，您就只缺少一个情妇了。”【注：①巴黎最贵族化的住宅区。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You have my word on it, no more than any other, I am sure. He is just what I need, he never takes no for an answer and I am keeping him."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“凭良心说，”伯爵答道，“我相信也不会比别人多。他很合我的标准，认为天下没有办不到的事，所以我留用了他。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Albert smiled, thinking of the beautiful Greek woman whom he had seen in the count's box at the Teatro Valle and the Argentina.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Who will tell her?" asked Monte Cristo.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“谁告诉她？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I have something better than that," Monte Cristo replied. "I have a slave. You hire your mistresses at the Théâtre de l'Opéra, at the Vaudeville, at the Variétés. I bought mine in Constantinople. She was more expensive, but I have no further worries on that score."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我有比情妇更妙的东西，”基督山说，“我有一个奴隶。你们的情妇是从戏院，歌舞团，或游戏场里弄来的，我却是在君士坦丁堡买来的。她花了我不少钱，但我也不在乎。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Shall we see her, at least?" asked Beauchamp. "Or, having already one dumb servant, do you also have eunuchs?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“但至少我们可以见见她吧，”波香说，“不然，难道您是雇用了哑巴太监来侍候她的吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Debray laughed. "You are forgetting that here, as King Charles said, we are Franks by name and frank by nature. As soon as she set foot in France, your slave became free."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“但您忘记啦，”狄布雷大笑着答道，“正是象查理国王所说的：我们法国人天性最坦白，她的脚一踏到法国，您的奴隶便自由了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No, certainly not," said Monte Cristo. "I do not take my orientalism that far. All those around me are free to leave, and will have no further need of me or of anyone else. Perhaps that is why they do not leave me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“噢，不，”基督山回答，“我可没有东方化到那步田地。我身边的人谁都可以自由离开我，而当他离开我的时候，他大概已不再有求于我或有求于任何人了，或许就是为了那种原因，所以他们没有离开我。”">查看中文翻译</div>

I must go back to my Ministry. I shall speak of the count to the minister and we must find out who he is."</div>
