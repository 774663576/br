<div class="line_en">It was late when Tom Joad drove along a country road looking for the Weedpatch camp. There were few lights in the countryside. Only a sky glare behind showed the direction of Bakersfield. The truck jiggled slowly along and hunting cats left the road ahead of it. At a crossroad there was a little cluster of white wooden buildings.</div>

<div class="line_en">Tom said, "I don' know where she is. Maybe we'll wait till daylight an' ast somebody." He stopped at a boulevard signal and another car stopped at the crossing. Tom leaned out. "Hey, mister. Know where the big camp is at?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="汤姆说：“我不知道收容所在哪儿。也许我们要等天亮问问人家才行。”他在林荫路上的一块牌子旁边停了车，另一辆汽车也在这交叉路口停住了。汤姆伸出头来。“喂，先生。你知道收容所在什么地方吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Tom pulled across into the opposite road. A few hundred yards, and then he stopped. A high wire fence faced the road, and a wide-gated driveway turned in. A little way inside the gate there was a small house with a light in the window. Tom turned in. The whole truck leaped into the air and crashed down again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="汤姆把卡车开到对面的路上。他开了几百码，又停下来。面向着大路，有一道高高的铁丝篱笆，还有一道宽阔的大门，门里通着一条车道。离门口不远的地方，有一所小房子，窗户里透着光。汤姆把卡车开进门去。卡车突然向上一蹦，又砰地一声落在地上。">查看中文翻译</div>

And a lot of the older folks wanted them. So it was up to the Central Committee. They went into meeting and here's how they fixed it. They say, 'Any preacher can preach in this camp.

<div class="line_en">Tom walked down the street between the rows of tents. His eyes grew used to the starlight. He saw that the rows were straight and that there was no litter about the tents. The ground of the street had been swept and sprinkled. From the tents came the snores of sleeping people. The whole camp buzzed and snorted. Tom walked slowly. He neared Number Four Sanitary Unit and he looked at it curiously, an unpainted building, low and rough. Under a roof, but open at the sides, the rows of wash trays. He saw the Joad truck standing near by, and went quietly toward it. The tarpaulin was pitched and the camp was quiet. As he drew near a figure moved from the shadow of the truck and came toward him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="汤姆顺着两排帐篷之间的一条路上走过去。他的眼睛在星光下渐渐习惯了。他看见那两排帐篷是笔直的，帐篷外面没有乱七八糟的东西。路面有人打扫过，而且洒过水。帐篷里传来了熟睡的人们的鼾声。整个场子上是一阵一阵呼噜呼噜的声音。汤姆慢慢地走着。他走近了第四清洁所，好奇地望着这个地方，那是一所没有油漆过的房子，又低矮，又粗陋。有一个两面敞开的屋子里摆着一排一排的面盆。他看见乔德家的卡车停在近处，便悄悄地走了过去。油布篷架起来了，帐篷里安安静静。他走过去的时候，卡车的阴影里闪出一个人影，向他走过来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The clash of iron sounded again. Tom looked down the line of tents, only a little lighter gray than the ground. Beside a tent he saw a flash of orange fire seeping from the cracks in an old iron stove. Gray smoke spurted up from a stubby smoke-pipe.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="铁器的丁当声又响起来了。汤姆向那排帐篷望过去，那灰色只比地面稍淡一些。他看见一个帐篷旁边有一道橙黄色的火光从一只旧铁炉子的裂缝里透出来。短短的烟筒里冒出一道灰色的炊烟。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was still dark when he awakened. A small clashing noise brought him up from sleep. Tom listened and heard again the squeak of iron on iron. He moved stiffly and shivered in the morning air. The camp still slept. Tom stood up and looked over the side of the truck. The eastern mountains were blue-black, and as he watched, the light stood up faintly behind them, colored at the mountain rims with a washed red, then growing colder, grayer, darker, as it went up overhead, until at a place near the western horizon it merged with pure night. Down in the valley the earth was the lavender-gray of dawn.</div>

He saw a girl working about the stove, saw that she carried a baby on her crooked arm, and that the baby was nursing, its head up under the girl's shirtwaist. And the girl moved about, poking the fire, shifting the rusty stove lids to make a better draft, opening the oven door; and all the time the baby sucked, and the mother shifted it deftly from arm to arm. The baby didn't interfere with her work or with the quick gracefulness of her movements. And the orange fire licked out of the stove cracks and threw flickering reflections on the tent.</div>

<div class="line_en">When Tom left her, Ruthie gazed in at the door of the sanitary unit for a while. Her courage was not strong without Winfield to boast for. She put a bare foot in on the concrete floor, and then withdrew it. Down the line a woman came out of a tent and started a fire in a tin camp stove. Ruthie took a few steps in that direction, but she could not leave. She crept to the entrance of the Joad tent and looked in. On one side, lying on the ground, lay Uncle John, his mouth open and his snores bubbling spittily in his throat. Ma and Pa were covered with a comfort, their heads in, away from the light. Al was on the far side from Uncle John, and his arm was flung over his eyes. Near the front of the tent Rose of Sharon and Winfield lay, and there was the space where Ruthie had been, beside Winfield. She squatted down and peered in. Her eyes remained on Winfield's tow head; and as she looked, the little boy opened his eyes and stared out at her, and his eyes were solemn. Ruthie put her finger to her lips and beckoned with her other hand. Winfield rolled his eyes over to Rose of Sharon. Her pink flushed face was near to him, and her mouth was open a little. Winfield carefully loosened the blanket and slipped out. He crept out of the tent cautiously and joined Ruthie. "How long you been up?" he whispered.</div>
