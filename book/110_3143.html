<div class="line_en">Some days after Mina got the Letter from Arthur, with the news of Lucy's death, she had another letter. This was from Professor Van Helsing, a friend of Arthur's. In it he wrote, "I know, from your letters to Lucy, that you were her dearest friend. I would very much like to meet you, to talk about the time when you were with Lucy at Whitby."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="明娜收到阿瑟的信，得知露西去世的消息几天后，她又收到一封信。这是阿瑟的一个朋友，范赫尔辛教授写来的。他在信中写道：“我从你给露西的信中得知，你是她最亲密的朋友。我非常想见见你，谈一谈你和露西在惠特比时的情况。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Ah!" he cried. "Now I begin to understand so many things! This Count Dracula -- he was the vampire that killed poor Miss Lucy. Will you help us to find him?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“啊！”他大声说道，“现在我开始弄明白很多事了！这个德拉库拉伯爵——他就是害死可怜的露西小姐的那个吸血鬼。你们愿意帮我们找到他吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So the Professor came to see us at our house, and we learnt the full story of poor Lucy's terrible death. Then Mina gave Van Helsing my diary to read, and he learnt about my time at Castle Dracula. He was very excited.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="后来，教授到家中来看我们，我们也由此知道了可怜的露西去世的全部可怕的经过。明娜给范赫尔辛看了我的日记，他知道了我在德拉库拉城堡的经历。他很激动。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Of course, Mina and I agreed to help. When I saw Count Dracula in London, I was very afraid, but now I felt stronger because I had work to do.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我和明娜当然同意帮忙。在伦敦见到德拉库拉伯爵时，我很害怕，但现在因为有正经事要做，我感觉坚强多了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We began at once. Mina went to stay with Jack Seward at his house, to tell him and Arthur all about the Count, and I went to Whitby. I wanted to find out about the coffins that were in the ship on the night of the storm -- the ship that brought Count Dracula to England. After many questions, I learnt that the coffins were now in the Count's house in London.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们马上开始行动。明娜去住在杰克·苏厄德的家，告诉他和阿瑟关于伯爵的一切情况，而我去了惠特比。我想了解在暴风雨的那天晚上，船上那些棺材的去向——就是那艘把伯爵带到英国的船。经多方打听，我得知那些棺材就在伯爵在伦敦的家里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jack had some old keys with him, and with one of these we got into the house. It was old and dirty, and the smell of blood was everywhere. We walked through the cold, empty rooms and at last we found the coffins.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杰克·苏厄德带了几把旧钥匙，我们用其中一把打开门，进入那房子。那里又旧又脏，而且到处弥漫着血腥味儿。我们穿过很多阴森森的空屋子，终于找到了那些棺材。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I hurried back to London and to Jack Seward's house. When I told Van Helsing this news, he called us all together, and said, "Now the danger begins. I have learnt much about vampires from old books, and I know that they can come out only at night. During the day they are like dead bodies and must have a place to hide. I think that Count Dracula uses his coffins for his daytime hiding places. If we can find him in a coffin. we can kill him. But let's go to his house tonight. We'll put holy bread in the coffins, and then the Count cannot get back into them. He'll then have no place to hide during the day, and he will be weaker, and easier to fight when we find him."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我匆匆赶回伦敦，又去，杰克·苏厄德的家。当我把这个消息告诉范赫尔辛时，他把我们召集到一起说：“现在危险降临了。我从古书上了解到吸血鬼的不少情况，我知道他们只能在晚上出来，白天他们就像死尸一样，而且必须找个地方躲起来。我想德拉库拉伯爵就是把那些棺材当作了他白天的藏身之地。如果我们能在棺材里找到他，就可以杀死他。但今晚咱们到他的住所去一趟，在那些棺材里放上圣餐饼，这样伯爵就不能再回到那里面去了。他白天就没有了藏身之处，会变得越来越虚弱，那么我们在找到他时，打败他也会容易些。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So that night Van Helsing, Jack, Arthur, and I went out together to the Count's house. Mina, of course, did not come with us. I was afraid to leave her alone, but she said that there was more danger for us than for her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天晚上，我、范赫尔辛、杰克·苏厄德和阿瑟一起去了伯爵的住宅。当然明娜没和我们一起去。把她独自留在那儿我很害怕，但她说我们要比她危险得多。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We looked up from our work and saw Count Dracula. He came through the dark room like a black cloud. His angry face was white and his eyes burned like red fires. Van Helsing held out his gold cross, and the Count stopped. Afraid for our lives, we ran from the house.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们停下工作，抬起头来，看见了德拉库拉伯爵。他像一片乌云一样穿过黑暗的房间。他一脸怒容，面色惨白，眼睛像两团燃烧着的红色火焰。范赫尔辛举起了他的金十字架，伯爵停住了。我们害怕有生命危险，就迅速离开了那座房子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Together we broke down the door -- and then my blood ran cold. A tall dark man was standing in the moonlight, by the window. In his arms he held my wife, my Mina! Her white nightdress had blood on it, and her face lay against Count Dracula. Blood dropped from his mouth, and he was holding Mina to him while she drank his blood!</div>

<div class="line_en">Mina shivered. "Don't leave me!" she cried. "Oh, please don't leave me!" Her face was pale, and we could see two little wounds on her neck. She put her head in her hands and gave a long, terrible scream. "Stay with me!" she cried.</div>
