<div class="line_en">Elias developed the theory of the Civilizing Process not by poring over numbers, which weren't available in his day, but by examining the texture of everyday life in medieval Europe. He examined, for instance, a series of drawings from the 15th-century German manuscript The Medieval Housebook, a depiction of daily life as seen through the eyes of a knight.</div>

<div class="line_en">Now let's consider the implications of the centuries-long decline in homicide in Europe. Do you think that city living, with its anonymity, crowding, immigrants, and jumble of cultures and classes, is a breeding ground for violence? What about the wrenching social changes brought on by capitalism and the Industrial Revolution? Is it your conviction that small-town life, centered on church, tradition, and fear of God, is our best bulwark against murder and mayhem? Well, think again. As Europe became more urban, cosmopolitan, commercial, industrialized, and secular, it got safer and safer. And that brings us back to the ideas of Norbert Elias, the only theory left standing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧洲凶杀率连续几个世纪下降，到底意味着什么呢？城市生活中来自五湖四海的移民，素不相识，却要拥挤地生活在一起，文化背景和阶级背景各不相同，这难道不是暴力的温床吗？资本主义和工业革命带来哪些痛苦的社会变迁？你是否相信，以教堂、传统和对神的畏惧为中心的小城镇生活，是我们抵挡谋杀和混乱的最佳防卫手段？再好好想一想！随着欧洲进入城市化、商业化、工业化和世俗化，它日趋一日越来越安全了。这就将我们带回到埃利亚斯的理论，它是唯一一个经得住验证的理论。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">States were ineffectual, and the king was merely the most prominent of the noblemen, with no permanent army and little control over the country. Governance was outsourced to the barons, knights, and other noblemen who controlled fiefs of various sizes, exacting crops and military service from the peasants who lived in them. The knights raided one another's territories in a Hobbesian dynamic of conquest, preemptive attack, and vengeance, and as the Housebook illustrations suggest, they did not restrict their killing to other knights. In A Distant Mirror: The Calamitous 14th Century, the historian Barbara Tuchman describes the way they made a living:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="国家毫无行动的能力，国王不过就是一个有点儿冒尖的贵族，没有常备军队，对国家没有任何实质性的控制。所谓的治理，就是国王分封了爵爷、骑士和其他贵族，由他们掌管大大小小的采邑，向领地内的农民征收粮食和徭役。骑士们经常以征战、偷袭和复仇这些霍布斯式的暴力方式进犯其他骑士的领地，如《中世纪家庭画册》插图上所示，他们在进行杀戮时毫不手软。在《远方之镜：多灾多难的14世纪》（A Distant Mirror：The Calamitous 14th Century）一书中，历史学家巴巴拉·塔奇曼（Barbara Tuchman）这样形容了他们的谋生之道：">查看中文翻译</div>

As a result, the chief victim of the belligerents was their respective peasantry.</div>

<div class="line_en">The private wars and tournaments were the backdrop to a life that was violent in other ways. As we saw, religious values were imparted with bloody crucifixes, threats of eternal torture, and prurient depictions of mutilated saints. Craftsmen applied their ingenuity to sadistic machines of punishment and execution. Brigands made travel a threat to life and limb, and ransoming captives was big business. As Elias noted, "the little people, too -- the hatters, the tailors, the shepherds -- were all quick to draw their knives." Even clergymen got into the act. The historian Barbara Hanawalt quotes an account from 14th-century England:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在私斗和比武的布景之下，生活中还充满了其他的暴力。我们已经看到，宗教价值观已经和滴着鲜血的十字架、永生永世的炼狱、对圣徒受肢解酷刑的刺激性描述融为一体。工匠们以独出心裁的创造力来制造各色虐待狂式的刑具。旅行成了玩命，匪徒劫持人质勒索赎金成了一门大买卖。埃利亚斯注意到：“小人物们，比如制帽工、裁缝和牧人，也都动辄拔刀相向。”甚至神职人员也不例外。历史学家巴巴拉·哈纳沃特（Barbara Hanawalt）引用14世纪英国的记载说：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As we saw in chapter 1, to maintain the credibility of their deterrent threat, knights engaged in bloody tournaments and other demonstrations of macho prowess, gussied up with words like honor, valor, chivalry, glory, and gallantry, which made later generations forget they were bloodthirsty marauders.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="正如我们在第1章中所见，为了维护威慑的可信度，骑士们举行血淋淋的竞赛和其他彰显男子气概的运动，并饰以荣誉、勇气、骑士精神、光荣和侠义之类的辞藻，以至于后人忘记了他们不过是些残暴的盗贼。">查看中文翻译</div>

But John would not send it to him without the money wherefore William became enraged, and, knocking in the door upon him, he struck John in the front part of the head so that his brains flowed forth and he died forthwith.</div>

<div class="line_en">During my decades in academia I have read thousands of scholarly papers on a vast range of topics, from the grammar of irregular verbs to the physics of multiple universes. But the oddest journal article I have ever read is "Losing Face, Saving Face: Noses and Honour in the Late Medieval Town." Here the historian Valentin Groebner documents dozens of accounts from medieval Europe in which one person cut off the nose of another. Sometimes it was an official punishment for heresy, treason, prostitution, or sodomy, but more often it was an act of private vengeance. In one case in Nuremberg in 1520, Hanns Rigel had an affair with the wife of Hanns von Eyb. A jealous von Eyb cut off the nose of Rigel's innocent wife, a supreme injustice multiplied by the fact that Rigel was sentenced to four weeks of imprisonment for adultery while von Eyb walked away scot-free. These mutilations were so common that, according to Groebner,</div>

Tuchman describes two of the popular sports of the time: "Players with hands tied behind them competed to kill a cat nailed to a post by battering it to death with their heads, at the risk of cheeks ripped open or eyes scratched out by the frantic animal's claws… Or a pig enclosed in a wide pen was chased by men with clubs to the laughter of spectators as he ran squealing from the blows until beaten lifeless."</div>

<div class="line_en">The practice was the source of our strange idiom to cut off your nose to spite your face. In late medieval times, cutting off someone's nose was the prototypical act of spite.</div>

<div class="line_en">the authors of late-medieval surgical textbooks also devote particular attention to nasal injuries, discussing whether a nose once cut off can grow back, a controversial question that the French royal physician Henri de Mondeville answered in his famous Chirurgia with a categorical "No." Other fifteenth-century medical authorities were more optimistic: Heinrich von Pforspundt's 1460 pharmacoepia promised, among other things, a prescription for "making a new nose" for those who had lost theirs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="中世纪晚期的一位外科教科书的作者，对鼻子外伤给予了特别的关注，专门讨论被割下来的鼻子是否能够再长回去。对于这个大家争论不休的问题，法国御医亨利·德·蒙德维尔在他的名著《整形外科》一书中给了一个结论性的回答：“不能。”而其他15世纪的医学权威们却要乐观得多，海因里希·冯·福尔思庞特1460年的《医药大典》夸下不少海口，其中之一就是一张专为失去鼻子的人“制作新鼻子”的处方。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Not that people were always going around with fierce looks, drawn brows and martial countenances… On the contrary, a moment ago they were joking, now they mock each other, one word leads to another, and suddenly from the midst of laughter they find themselves in the fiercest feud. Much of what appears contradictory to us -- the intensity of their piety, the violence of their fear of hell, their guilt feelings, their penitence, the immense outbursts of joy and gaiety, the sudden flaring and the uncontrollable force of their hatred and belligerence -- all these, like the rapid changes of mood, are in reality symptoms of one and the same structuring of the emotional life. The drives, the emotions were vented more freely, more directly, more openly than later. It is only to us, in whom everything is more subdued, moderate, and calculated, and in whom social taboos are built much more deeply into the fabric of our drive-economy as self-restraints, that the unveiled intensity of this piety, belligerence, or cruelty appears to be contradictory.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="并不是说他们总是面露凶色、横眉怒目，时时刻刻挥刀弄剑…相反，他们本来是在乐呵呵地互相调侃，甩出一连串的嘲弄字眼儿，但就在笑语喧哗声中，他们可以突然拔刀相向，开始玩命地厮杀。我们看到的中世纪的人充满了矛盾——他们有虔诚的宗教信仰，对地狱怀有极度的恐惧，心怀沉重的罪感和忏悔，同时疯狂地追求狂欢和享乐，他们的性情暴躁易变，毫无克制地仇恨和好勇斗狠——所有这一切，都可以出现在同一个人身上，而且阴晴不定、瞬息可变，这就是当时人们完全同构的情感生活。比起后来的人，中世纪的人更冲动，感情的表达更自由、更直接，也更开放。只是到了我们这里，一切才变得微妙、温和和精于算计。社会禁忌作为各式各样的自我克制，深深地渗透到追究功利的社会机体中，所以我们才会觉得不加隐藏的宗教虔诚、桀骜不驯的派头和凶残的行为是相互矛盾的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Tuchman too writes of the "childishness noticeable in medieval behavior, with its marked inability to restrain any kind of impulse." Dorothy Sayers, in the introduction to her translation of The Song of Roland, adds, "The idea that a strong man should react to great personal and national calamities by a slight compression of the lips and by silently throwing his cigarette into the fireplace is of very recent origin."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="塔奇曼也这样写道：“中世纪人的行为带有显而易见的幼稚，他们无法克制自己的任何冲动。”多萝西·塞耶丝（Dorotry Sayers）翻译了《罗兰之歌》（The song of Roland）。她在序言中提到，“在个人的和民族的大灾大难临头时，轻轻地抿住嘴唇，静静地将烟头扔进壁炉，这种硬汉形象，是非常晚近的事情”。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Though the childishness of the medievals was surely exaggerated, there may indeed be differences in degree in the mores of emotional expression in different eras. Elias spends much of The Civilizing Process documenting this transition with an unusual database: manuals of etiquette. Today we think of these books, like Amy Vanderbilt's Everyday Etiquette and Miss Manners' Guide to Excruciatingly Correct Behavior, as sources of handy tips for avoiding embarrassing peccadilloes. But at one time they were serious guides to moral conduct, written by the leading thinkers of the day. In 1530 the great scholar Desiderius Erasmus, one of the founders of modernity, wrote an etiquette manual called On Civility in Boys which was a bestseller throughout Europe for two centuries. By laying down rules for what people ought not to do, these manuals give us a snapshot of what they must have been doing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽然中世纪人的孩子气肯定有被夸大的成分，不同的时代，人们表达情感的习俗确实有所不同。埃利亚斯在《文明的进程》一书中，用很大篇幅记录了一组不同寻常的数据资料——礼仪手册。今天，我们认为《艾米·范德比尔特家族礼仪》（Amy Vanderbilt’s Everyday Etiquette）和《曼纳斯小姐行为矫正指南》（Miss Manners’Guide to Excruciatingly Cornect Behavior）这类的书，只是提供了一些免于失态受窘的小常识。但是，在过去，曾经由那个时代的思想大家出手撰写人们必须恪守的道德指南。1530年，人文运动的创始人之一、大学者德西德里乌斯·伊拉斯谟（Desiderius Erasmus），撰写了一本名为“论男孩的礼貌教育”（On Civility in Boys）的行为手册，该书在欧洲畅销了整整200年。这种手册明确规定了哪些行为是不可接受的失礼，也让我们从中知道了哪些是当时人必须遵守的规则。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In the mind of a modern reader, these advisories set off a train of reactions. How inconsiderate, how boorish, how animalistic, how immature those people must have been! These are the kinds of directives you'd expect a parent to give to a three-year-old, not a great philosopher to a literate readership. Yet as Elias points out, the habits of refinement, self-control, and consideration that are second nature to us had to be acquired -- that's why we call them second nature -- and they developed in Europe over the course of its modern history.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the European Middle Ages, sexual activity too was less discreet. People were publicly naked more often, and couples took only perfunctory measures to keep their coitus private. Prostitutes offered their services openly; in many English towns, the red-light district was called Gropecunt Lane. Men would discuss their sexual exploits with their children, and a man's illegitimate offspring would mix with his legitimate ones. During the transition to modernity, this openness came to be frowned upon as uncouth and then as unacceptable.</div>

<div class="line_en">The change left its mark in the language. Words for peasantry took on a second meaning as words for turpitude: boor (which originally just meant "farmer," as in the German Bauer and Dutch boer); villain (from the French vilein, a serf or villager); churlish (from English churl, a commoner); vulgar (common, as in the term vulgate); and ignoble, not an aristocrat. Many of the words for the fraught actions and substances became taboo. Englishmen used to swear by invoking supernatural beings, as in My God! and Jesus Christ! At the start of the modern era they began to invoke sexuality and excretion, and the "Anglo-Saxon four-letter words," as we call them today, could no longer be used in polite company. As the historian Geoffrey Hughes has noted, "The days when the dandelion could be called the pissabed, a heron could be called a shitecrow and the windhover could be called the windfucker have passed away with the exuberant phallic advertisement of the codpiece."Bastard, cunt, arse, and whore also passed from ordinary to taboo.</div>

In the Middle Ages, most people carried a knife and would use it at the dinner table to carve a chunk of meat off the roasted carcass, spear it, and bring it to their mouths.

<div class="line_en">Some of the medieval knife taboos remain with us today. Many people will not give a knife as a present unless it is accompanied by a coin, which the recipient gives back, to make the transaction a sale rather than a gift. The ostensible reason is to avoid the symbolism of "severing the friendship," but a more likely reason is to avoid the symbolism of directing an unsolicited knife in the friend's direction. A similar superstition makes it bad luck to hand someone a knife: one is supposed to lay it down on the table and allow the recipient to pick it up. Knives in table settings are rounded at the end and no sharper than needed: steak knives are brought out for tough meat, and blunter knives substituted for fish. And knives may be used only when they are absolutely necessary. It's rude to use a knife to eat a piece of cake, to bring food to your mouth, to mix ingredients ("Stir with a knife, stir up strife"), or to push food onto your fork.</div>

<div class="line_en">Elias's theory, then, attributes the decline in European violence to a larger psychological change (the subtitle of his book is Sociogenetic and Psychogenetic Investigations). He proposed that over a span of several centuries, beginning in the 11th or 12th and maturing in the 17th and 18th, Europeans increasingly inhibited their impulses, anticipated the long-term consequences of their actions, and took other people's thoughts and feelings into consideration. A culture of honor -- the readiness to take revenge -- gave way to a culture of dignity -- the readiness to control one's emotions. These ideals originated in explicit instructions that cultural arbiters gave to aristocrats and noblemen, allowing them to differentiate themselves from the villains and boors. But they were then absorbed into the socialization of younger and younger children until they became second nature. The standards also trickled down from the upper classes to the bourgeoisie that strove to emulate them, and from them to the lower classes, eventually becoming a part of the culture as a whole.</div>

<div class="line_en">Elias helped himself to Freud's structural model of the psyche, in which children acquire a conscience (the superego) by internalizing the injunctions of their parents when they are too young to understand them. At that point the child's ego can apply these injunctions to keep their biological impulses (the id) in check. Elias stayed away from Freud's more exotic claims (such as the primeval parricide, the death instinct, and the oedipal complex), and his psychology is thoroughly modern. In chapter 9 we will look at a faculty of the mind that psychologists call self-control, delay of gratification, and shallow temporal discounting and that laypeople call counting to ten, holding your horses, biting your tongue, saving for a rainy day, and keeping your pecker in your pocket. We will also look at a faculty that psychologists call empathy, intuitive psychology, perspective-taking, and theory of mind and that laypeople call getting into other people's heads, seeing the world from their point of view, walking a mile in their moccasins, and feeling their pain. Elias anticipated the scientific study of both of these better angels.</div>

<div class="line_en">To his credit, Elias leapfrogged academic fashion in not claiming that early modern Europeans "invented" or "constructed" self-control. He claimed only that they toned up a mental faculty that had always been a part of human nature but which the medievals had underused. He repeatedly drove the point home with the pronouncement "There is no zero point." As we shall see in chapter 9, exactly how people dial their capacity for self-control up or down is an interesting topic in psychology. One possibility is that self-control is like a muscle, so that if you exercise it with table manners it will be stronger across the board and more effective when you have to stop yourself from killing the person who just insulted you. Another possibility is that a particular setting of the self-control dial is a social norm, like how close you can stand to another person or how much of your body has to be covered in public. A third is that self-control can be adjusted adaptively according to its costs and benefits in the local environment. Self-control, after all, is not an unmitigated good. The problem with having too much self-control is that an aggressor can use it to his advantage, anticipating that you may hold back from retaliating because it's too late to do any good. But if he had reason to believe that you would lash out reflexively, consequences be damned, he might treat you with more respect in the first place. In that case people might adjust a self-control slider according to the dangerousness of those around them.</div>

<div class="line_en">But Elias did propose an exogenous trigger to get the whole thing started, indeed, two triggers. The first was the consolidation of a genuine Leviathan after centuries of anarchy in Europe's feudal patchwork of baronies and fiefs. Centralized monarchies gained in strength, brought the warring knights under their control, and extended their tentacles into the outer reaches of their kingdoms. According to the military historian Quincy Wright, Europe had five thousand independent political units (mainly baronies and principalities) in the 15th century, five hundred at the time of the Thirty Years' War in the early 17th, two hundred at the time of Napoleon in the early 19th, and fewer than thirty in 1953.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是埃利亚斯确实提出，存在外源触发器，准确地说，是两个外源触发器激发了暴力下降的整个过程。第一个外源触发器是，欧洲在经历了几个世纪的封建领主和采邑林立的无政府状态后，出现了真正的利维坦。中央集权的君主们整合了战乱不休的骑士们，并将自己的触角伸延到王国的疆域之外。根据军事历史学家昆西·赖特的研究，在15世纪，欧洲有5000个独立的政治单元（主要是领主封地和小公国），17世纪早期“三十年战争”时期是500个政治单元，19世纪初期的拿破仑时代是200个政治单元，而在1953年，欧洲只剩下不到30个独立的政治单元了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At this point in the story, the theory of the Civilizing Process is incomplete, because it appeals to a process that is endogenous to the phenomenon it is trying to explain. A decline in violent behavior, it says, coincided with a decline in impulsiveness, honor, sexual license, incivility, and boorishness at the dinner table. But this just entangles us in a web of psychological processes. It hardly counts as an explanation to say that people behaved less violently because they learned to inhibit their violent impulses. Nor can we feel confident that people's impulsiveness changed first and that a reduction in violence was the result, rather than the other way around.</div>

<div class="line_en">The consolidation of political units was in part a natural process of agglomeration in which a moderately powerful warlord swallowed his neighbors and became a still more powerful warlord. But the process was accelerated by what historians call the military revolution: the appearance of gunpowder weapons, standing armies, and other expensive technologies of war that could only be supported by a large bureaucracy and revenue base. A guy on a horse with a sword and a ragtag band of peasants was no match for the massed infantry and artillery that a genuine state could put on the battlefield.

For a knight to lay down his arms and let the state deter his enemies was a risky move, because his enemies could see it as a sign of weakness.

<div class="line_en">Feuding among knights and peasants was not just a nuisance but a lost opportunity. During Norman rule in England, some genius recognized the lucrative possibilities in nationalizing justice. For centuries the legal system had treated homicide as a tort: in lieu of vengeance, the victim's family would demand a payment from the killer's family, known as blood money or wergild ("man-payment"; the wer is the same prefix as in werewolf, "man-wolf"). King Henry I redefined homicide as an offense against the state and its metonym, the crown. Murder cases were no longer John Doe vs. Richard Roe, but The Crown vs. John Doe (or later, in the United States, The People vs. John Doe or The State of Michigan vs. John Doe). The brilliance of the plan was that the wergild (often the offender's entire assets, together with additional money rounded up from his family) went to the king instead of to the family of the victim. Justice was administered by roving courts that would periodically visit a locale and hear the accumulated cases. To ensure that all homicides were presented to the courts, each death was investigated by a local agent of the crown: the coroner.</div>

<div class="line_en">Once Leviathan was in charge, the rules of the game changed. A man's ticket to fortune was no longer being the baddest knight in the area but making a pilgrimage to the king's court and currying favor with him and his entourage. The court, basically a government bureaucracy, had no use for hotheads and loose cannons, but sought responsible custodians to run its provinces. The nobles had to change their marketing. They had to cultivate their manners, so as not to offend the king's minions, and their empathy, to understand what they wanted. The manners appropriate for the court came to be called "courtly" manners or "courtesy." The etiquette guides, with their advice on where to place one's nasal mucus, originated as manuals for how to behave in the king's court. Elias traces the centuries-long sequence in which courtesy percolated down from aristocrats dealing with the court to the elite bourgeoisie dealing with the aristocrats, and from them to the rest of the middle class. He summed up his theory, which linked the centralization of state power to a psychological change in the populace, with a slogan: Warriors to courtiers.</div>

<div class="line_en">A positive-sum game is a scenario in which agents have choices that can improve the lots of both of them at the same time. A classic positive-sum game in everyday life is the exchange of favors, where each person can confer a large benefit to another at a small cost to himself or herself. Examples include primates who remove ticks from each other's backs, hunters who share meat whenever one of them has felled an animal that is too big for him to consume on the spot, and parents who take turns keeping each other's children out of trouble. As we shall see in chapter 8, a key insight of evolutionary psychology is that human cooperation and the social emotions that support it, such as sympathy, trust, gratitude, guilt, and anger, were selected because they allow people to flourish in positive-sum games. 37</div>

"To ensure that no one gained an advantage over anyone else," Tuchman explains, "commercial law prohibited innovation in tools or techniques, underselling below a fixed price, working late by artificial light, employing extra apprentices or wife and under-age children, and advertising of wares or praising them to the detriment of others."

<div class="line_en">A classic positive-sum game in economic life is the trading of surpluses. If a farmer has more grain than he can eat, and a herder has more milk than he can drink, both of them come out ahead if they trade some wheat for some milk. As they say, everybody wins. Of course, an exchange at a single moment in time only pays when there is a division of labor. There would be no point in one farmer giving a bushel of wheat to another farmer and receiving a bushel of wheat in return. A fundamental insight of modern economics is that the key to the creation of wealth is a division of labor, in which specialists learn to produce a commodity with increasing cost-effectiveness and have the means to exchange their specialized products efficiently. One infrastructure that allows efficient exchange is transportation, which makes it possible for producers to trade their surpluses even when they are separated by distance. Another is money, interest, and middlemen, which allow producers to exchange many kinds of surpluses with many other producers at many points in time.</div>

<div class="line_en">And this brings us to the second exogenous change. Elias noted that in the late Middle Ages people began to unmire themselves from technological and economic stagnation. Money increasingly replaced barter, aided by the larger national territories in which a currency could be recognized. The building of roads, neglected since Roman times, resumed, allowing the transport of goods to the hinterlands of the country and not just along its coasts and navigable rivers. Horse transport became more efficient with the use of horseshoes that protected hooves from paving stones and yokes that didn't choke the poor horse when it pulled a heavy load. Wheeled carts, compasses, clocks, spinning wheels, treadle looms, windmills, and water mills were also perfected in the later Middle Ages. And the specialized expertise needed to implement these technologies was cultivated in an expanding stratum of craftsmen. The advances encouraged the division of labor, increased surpluses, and lubricated the machinery of exchange. Life presented people with more positive-sum games and reduced the attractiveness of zero-sum plunder. To take advantage of the opportunities, people had to plan for the future, control their impulses, take other people's perspectives, and exercise the other social and cognitive skills needed to prosper in social networks.</div>

<div class="line_en">The two triggers of the Civilizing Process -- the Leviathan and gentle commerce -- are related. The positive-sum cooperation of commerce flourishes best inside a big tent presided over by a Leviathan. Not only is a state well suited to provide the public goods that serve as infrastructure for economic cooperation, such as money and roads, but it can put a thumb on the scale on which players weigh the relative payoffs of raiding and trading. Suppose a knight can either plunder ten bushels of grain from his neighbor or, by expending the same amount of time and energy, raise the money to buy five bushels from him. The theft option looks pretty good. But if the knight anticipates that the state will fine him six bushels for the theft, he'd be left with only four, so he's better off with honest toil. Not only do the Leviathan's incentives make commerce more attractive, but commerce makes the job of the Leviathan easier. If the honest alternative of buying the grain hadn't been available, the state would have had to threaten to squeeze ten bushels out of the knight to deter him from plundering, which is harder to enforce than squeezing five bushels out of him. Of course, in reality the state's sanctions may be the threat of physical punishment rather than a fine, but the principle is the same: it's easier to deter people from crime if the lawful alternative is more appealing.</div>

<div class="line_en">Indeed the "organic" analogy is not far-fetched. The biologists John Maynard Smith and Eörs Szathmáry have argued that an evolutionary dynamic similar to the Civilizing Process drove the major transitions in the history of life. These transitions were the successive emergence of genes, chromosomes, bacteria, cells with nuclei, organisms, sexually reproducing organisms, and animal societies. In each transition, entities with the capacity to be either selfish or cooperative tended toward cooperation when they could be subsumed into a larger whole. They specialized, exchanged benefits, and developed safeguards to prevent one of them from exploiting the rest to the detriment of the whole. The journalist Robert Wright sketches a similar arc in his book Nonzero, an allusion to positive-sum games, and extends it to the history of human societies. In the final chapter of this book I will take a closer look at overarching theories of the decline of violence.</div>

<div class="line_en">Elias himself was haunted by the not-so-civilized behavior of his native Germany during World War II, and he labored to explain that "decivilizing process" within the framework of his theory. He discussed the fitful history of German unification and the resulting lack of trust in a legitimate central authority. He documented the persistence of a militaristic culture of honor among its elites, the breakdown of a state monopoly on violence with the rise of communist and fascist militias, and a resulting contraction of empathy for groups perceived to be outsiders, particularly the Jews. It would be a stretch to say that he rescued his theory with these analyses, but perhaps he shouldn't have tried. The horrors of the Nazi era did not consist in an upsurge in feuding among warlords or of citizens stabbing each other over the dinner table, but in violence whose scale, nature, and causes are altogether different. In fact in Germany during the Nazi years the declining trend for one-on-one homicides continued (see, for example, figure3-19). In chapter 8 we will see how the compartmentalization of the moral sense, and the distribution of belief and enforcement among different sectors of a population, can lead to ideologically driven wars and genocides even in otherwise civilized societies.</div>

<div class="line_en">Many criminologists believe that the source of the state's pacifying effect isn't just its brute coercive power but the trust it commands among the populace. After all, no state can post an informant in every pub and farmhouse to monitor breaches of the law, and those that try are totalitarian dictatorships that rule by fear, not civilized societies where people coexist through self-control and empathy. A Leviathan can civilize a society only when the citizens feel that its laws, law enforcement, and other social arrangements are legitimate, so that they don't fall back on their worst impulses as soon as Leviathan's back is turned. This doesn't refute Elias's theory, but it adds a twist. An imposition of the rule of law may end the bloody mayhem of feuding warlords, but reducing rates of violence further, to the levels enjoyed by modern European societies, involves a more nebulous process in which certain populations accede to the rule of law that has been imposed on them.</div>

<div class="line_en">Informal norms of this kind have emerged among fishers, farmers, and herders in many parts of the world. In Order Without Law: How Neighbors Settle Disputes, the legal scholar Robert Ellickson studied a modern American version of the ancient (and frequently violent) confrontation between pastoralists and farmers. In northern California's Shasta County, traditional ranchers are essentially cowboys, grazing their cattle in open country, while modern ranchers raise cattle in irrigated, fenced ranches. Both kinds of ranchers coexist with farmers who grow hay, alfalfa, and other crops. Straying cattle occasionally knock down fences, eat crops, foul streams, and wander onto roads where vehicles can hit them. The county is carved into "open ranges," in which an owner is not legally liable for most kinds of accidental damage his cattle may cause, and "closed ranges," in which he is strictly liable, whether he was negligent or not. Ellickson discovered that victims of harm by cattle were loath to invoke the legal system to settle the damages. In fact, most of the residents -- ranchers, farmers, insurance adjustors, even lawyers and judges -- held beliefs about the applicable laws that were flat wrong. But the residents got along by adhering to a few tacit norms. Cattle owners were always responsible for the damage their animals caused, whether a range was open or closed; but if the damage was minor and sporadic, property owners were expected to "lump it." People kept rough long-term mental accounts of who owed what, and the debts were settled in kind rather than in cash. (For example, a cattleman whose cow damaged a rancher's fence might at a later time board one of the rancher's stray cattle at no charge.) Deadbeats and violators were punished with gossip and with occasional veiled threats or minor vandalism. In chapter 9 we'll take a closer look at the moral psychology behind such norms, which fall into a category called equality matching.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="世界上许多地方的渔民、农民和牧民中都有这一类非正式的规则。在《无需法律的秩序：邻人如何解决纠纷》（Order Without Law：How Neighbors Settle Disputes）一书中，法学家罗伯特·埃里克森（Robert Ellickson）研究了一个现代美国版的古老（经常是暴戾）的冲突，牧民和农民之间的纠纷。在北加利福尼亚州沙斯塔县（Shasta County），传统上牧场主是牛仔，在开放的草场上放养牛群，而现代牧场主则在有灌溉、有围栏的牧场上养牛。两种牧场主和种植干草、苜蓿和其他谷物的农场主共处。离群的牛会不时拱翻围栏，吃掉庄稼，弄脏溪流，在公路上游荡，被汽车撞倒。该县将牧场分为两类，一类是“开放牧场”。在开放牧场上，牛主人无须对这一类意外损害承担法律责任；另一类是“封闭牧场”。在封闭牧场上，牛的主人对牛造成的一切损失负有全责，无论他是疏忽大意还是有其他原因。埃里克森发现，财产受到牛只伤害的人都不愿意求助司法系统裁决损失和赔偿。事实上，大部分居民——牧场主、农场主、保险公司的调停人，甚至律师和法官，都坚信为此等纠纷动用法律是绝对错误的。居民们通过寥寥数项隐性规范即可和睦相处。牛的主人对牛造成的损失始终负有全责，无论牧场是开放的还是封闭的，但是，如果损失微小，或者是偶发的，受损财产的主人应该“不予计较”。人们心里大致都有一本账，记着人欠我欠，而偿还往往不是货币形式的。（比如，一位牧牛人的牛损坏了一位牧场主的栅栏，这位牧牛人某天为这位牧场主免费看护了走失的牲口。）对于赖账和违约的惩罚主要是闲言碎语，间或会有私下的威胁，或者轻微的破坏行动。我会在第9章分析这些规范背后的道德心理，它属于公平对等概念的范畴。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As important as tacit norms are, it would be a mistake to think that they obviate a role for government. The Shasta County ranchers may not have called in Leviathan when a cow knocked over a fence, but they were living in its shadow and knew it would step in if their informal sanctions escalated or if something bigger were at stake, such as a fight, a killing, or a dispute over women. And as we shall see, their current level of peaceful coexistence is itself the legacy of a local version of the Civilizing Process. In the 1850s, the annual homicide rate of northern California ranchers was around 45 per 100,000, comparable to those of medieval Europe.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="隐性规范非常重要，但它却不能取代政府。沙斯塔县的牧场主们不会因为牛撞倒了栅栏而求助政府，但他们知道，他们生活在公权的庇荫之下，一旦他们的非正式制裁失效，或者发生了更严重的纠纷，比如打架、杀人或者争抢妇女，公权会立即介入。我们将会看到，他们目前能够如此和平共处本身，就是一个地方性“文明的进程”的传奇。在19世纪50年代，北加利福尼亚州牧场主的年均凶杀率是10万分之45，相当于中世纪欧洲的水平。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I think the theory of the Civilizing Process provides a large part of the explanation for the modern decline of violence not only because it predicted the remarkable plunge in European homicide but because it makes correct predictions about the times and places in the modern era that do not enjoy the blessed 1-per-100,000-per-year rate of modern Europe. Two of these rule-proving exceptions are zones that the Civilizing Process never fully penetrated : the lower strata of the socioeconomic scale, and the inaccessible or inhospitable territories of the globe. And two are zones in which the Civilizing Process went into reverse: the developing world, and the 1960s. Let's visit them in turn.</div>
