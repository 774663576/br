<div class="line_en">Christian on his knees at my feet, holding me with his steady gray gaze, is the most chilling and sobering sight I have ever seen -- more so than Leila and her gun. The vague alcoholic fuzziness I'm suffering from evaporates in an instant, and is replaced by a prickling scalp and a creeping sense of doom as the blood drains from my face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克里斯钦跪在我脚边，银灰眼眸牢牢地盯住我，我从没见过如此令人恐惧又冷肃的景象——甚至比拿着枪的蕾拉更甚。原先因酒精造成的些微晕眩瞬间消散，被头皮发麻及毛骨悚然的毁灭感所取代，我脸上的血液似乎被抽干了。">查看中文翻译</div>

The image of a powerful man who's really still a little boy, who was horrifically abused and neglected, who feels unworthy of love from his perfect family and his much-less-than-perfect girlfriend… my lost boy… it's heartbreaking.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="泪珠滑下我的脸颊，我忍受不了看他像那可怜兮兮的蕾拉一样摆出臣服的姿态。一个有权有势的男人，内心却还是个小孩，因为曾经遭到狠狠的虐待和忽视，认为自己不配被爱，不值得拥有那个完美家庭及没那么完美的女友付出的爱…我那迷失的小男孩…这个画面令人心如刀割。">查看中文翻译</div>

I had a glimpse into how your life has been… and…" I gaze down at my knotted fingers, tears still trickling down my cheeks. "This is about me not being good enough for you. It was an insight into your life, and I am so scared you'll get bored with me, and then you'll go… and I'll end up like Leila… a shadow.

<div class="line_en">He swallows. "Seeing her in that state, knowing that I might have something to do with her mental breakdown…" He closes his eyes once more.

<div class="line_en">Then it dawns on me that everything he did was to keep me safe, and perhaps Leila, too, because he also cares for her. But how much does he care for her?

<div class="line_en">I can't. I know that if I do, I will burst into tears. This is just too much to absorb. I'm like an overflowing tank of gasoline -- full, beyond capacity. There is no room for any more. I simply cannot cope with any more crap. I will combust and explode, and it will be ugly if I try. Jeez!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我办不到，我知道若我这么做了一定会泪如雨下。我承载不了这么多事情，我就像一缸加得太满的汽油，因为超出容量而满溢。已经没有空间了，我就是没办法再去应付任何废话，我会因此爆炸燃烧，而如果我这么做了，场面一定会很难看，哎！">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="噢，心好痛。我深深地、稳稳地吸进一口气。或许他指的是他自己，他才是那个身心都被摧残殆尽的孩子，这样讲就通了些…但可能也根本没道理。噢，这真的烂透了，突地，我累得像连骨头都快散了，我需要睡眠。">查看中文翻译</div>
