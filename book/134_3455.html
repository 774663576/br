<div class="line_en">Therese went to Carol's big suitcase at the foot of the bed. It was full of sweaters and underwear and shoes, but no slacks. She saw a nickel plated tube sticking out of a folded sweater. She lifted the sweater out. It was heavy. She unwrapped it, and started so she almost dropped it. It was a gun with a white handle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特芮丝走到卡罗尔放在床脚的大行李箱边，里面装满了毛衣、内衣裤和鞋子，但没有便裤。她看到一根镀镍的管子从折好的毛衣里伸出来，于是把毛衣拿出来。毛衣很重，她把它打开，里面的东西差点掉下来。原来是把手枪，枪柄是白色的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="特芮丝把毛巾拿给卡罗尔。她把毛巾交给卡罗尔时非常紧张，眼睛从卡罗尔的脸往下看，看到卡罗尔未加遮蔽的胸部，然后又继续往下看。卡罗尔转身过去时眼神中闪过一瞬间的惊讶之情。特芮丝紧闭双眼，慢慢走回床边，即使闭上了眼睛，她还是能看到卡罗尔裸体的影像。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Carol turned to her, combing her hair that was darkened a little by the wet of the shower. Her lips were bright with fresh lipstick, a cigarette between them.

<div class="line_en">Therese said nothing more about it. But it disturbed her whenever she thought of it. She thought of it the next night, when a bellhop set the suitcase down heavily on the sidewalk. She wondered if a gun could ever go off from a jolt like that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特芮丝没有再多说什么，但她只要一想到这件事就觉得心烦意乱。隔天晚上她又想到那把枪，那时有个侍者把行李箱重重地放在人行道上。她担心那把枪会不会因震动而走火。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh. So that's what's bothering you. It's Harge's gun, something else he forgot." Carol's voice was casual. "I thought it'd be better to take it than to leave it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“原来就是这件事在困扰着你。那是哈吉的枪，他忘了带走。”卡罗尔的声音一派轻松。“我想最好还是带着枪，而不是放在家里。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They had taken some snapshots in Ohio, and because they could get them developed early the next morning, they spent a long evening and the night in a town called Defiance. All evening they walked around the streets, looking in store windows, walking through silent residential streets where lights showed in front parlors, and homes looked as comfortable and safe as birds' nests. Therese had been afraid Carol would be bored by aimless walks, but Carol was the one who suggested going one block farther, walking all the way up the hill to see what was on the other side. Carol talked about herself and Harge. Therese tried to sum up in one word what had separated Carol and Harge, but she rejected the words almost at once -- boredom, resentment, indifference. Carol told her of one time that Harge had taken Rindy away on a fishing trip and not communicated for days. That was a retaliation for Carol's refusing to spend Harge's vacation with him at his family's summer house in Massachusetts. It was a mutual thing. And the incidents were not the start.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她们在俄亥俄州拍了些照片。由于次日早上没时间冲印照片，所以她们前一个晚上就在一个叫迪范恩斯的小镇上，花了整晚的时间洗照片，还在街道上看着商店窗户，走过安静的住宅区街道。那些街道上的店家前面都有灯光，住宅区则像鸟巢一样舒适安全。特芮丝一直担心这样漫无目的地走卡罗尔会无聊，可是建议再多走一个街区的却是卡罗尔。卡罗尔一路走到山丘上，想看另一边有什么东西。卡罗尔谈到自己和哈吉的事情，特芮丝想用一个字来总结卡罗尔和哈吉分开的原因，但她几乎又立刻否决了这些字眼：无趣、憎恨、冷淡。卡罗尔说过，有次哈吉带琳蒂去钓鱼，连续好几天都没和她联络。那是一种报复，报复卡罗尔不肯与他到他家人在马萨诸塞州的夏日小屋度假。这是双方都要负责的事情，问题并不始于这些事。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At the main post office, Therese found a post card from Dannie, nothing from Phil, and a letter from Richard. Therese glanced at the letter and saw it began and ended affectionately. She had expected just that, Richard's getting the general delivery address from Phil and writing her an affectionate letter. She put the letter in her pocket before she went back to Carol.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特芮丝在邮政总局找到丹尼寄来的明信片，菲尔什么也没寄，另外还有理查德寄来的一封信。特芮丝瞄了那封信一眼，看到开头和结尾的地方都很深情。她早已料到理查德会向菲尔要来存局待领邮件的地址，然后写给她一封情真意切的信。她把信放进口袋里，然后走回卡罗尔身边。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Carol put two of the snapshots in her billfold, one of Rindy in jodhpurs and a derby that had been on the first part of the roll, and one of Therese, with a cigarette in her mouth and her hair blowing back in the wind.

<div class="line_en">They got to Chicago late one afternoon, crept into its gray, sprawling disorder behind a great truck of a meat-distributing company. Therese sat up close to the windshield. She couldn't remember anything about the city from the trip with her father: Carol seemed to know Chicago as well as she knew Manhattan. Carol showed her the famous Loop, and they stopped for a while to watch the trains and the homeward rush of five thirty in the afternoon. It couldn't compare to the madhouse of New York at five thirty.</div>

<div class="line_en">Therese looked out the window at the light-bordered lake and at the irregular, unfamiliar line of tall buildings against the still grayish sky. It looked fuzzy and monotonous, like a Pissarro painting. A comparison Carol wouldn't appreciate, she thought. She leaned on the sill, staring at the city, watching a distant car's lights chopped into dots and dashes as it passed behind trees. She was happy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特芮丝看着窗外四周被灯光围绕着的湖泊，也看着灰蒙蒙的天空下，鳞次栉比的高耸建筑陌生的轮廓线。外面的景象模糊不清而且单调，就像毕加索的画一样。她认为卡罗尔可能不会欣赏她做出的这种对比。她靠在窗台上，注视着这个城市，看着远处的车子通过后面的树林时，灯光碎成一个一个小点，以及一条一条长长的线条。她很快乐。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Therese read Richard's letter while Carol was in the shower. The whole letter was affectionate. You are not like any of the other girls, he wrote. He had waited and he would keep on waiting, because he was absolutely confident that they could be happy together. He wanted her to write to him every day, send at least a post card. He told her how he had sat one evening rereading the three letters she had sent him when he had been in Kingston, New York, last summer. There was a sentimentality in the letter that was not like Richard at all, and Therese's first thought was that he was pretending. Perhaps in order to strike at her later. Her second reaction was aversion. She came back to the old decision, that not to write him, not to say anything more was the shortest way to end it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡罗尔洗澡时，特芮丝读着理查德深情款款的信。你跟任何其他女孩都不一样，他写道。他一直在等待，也会一直等下去，因为他相信他们能快乐地生活在一起。他要她每天写信给他，至少寄张明信片。他告诉她，去年夏天，有天晚上在金斯顿，纽约，他是怎么坐着，重读去年夏天她写给他的三封信。理查德的信里流露出感伤，一点也不像他，特芮丝的第一个念头就是他在惺惺作态。或许是为了打动她。她的第二个反应则是嫌恶。她坚持自己原来的决定，不会再写信给他了，结束一切最快的方式，就是不再多说任何事了。">查看中文翻译</div>

She flung a yellow-silk scarf around her neck and tied it loosely and began to comb her hair.

Therese stopped, but Carol waited for her to go on. Carol always waited, and she could never say exactly what she wanted to say. "Early one morning when I was on the way to work, and I remember it was starting to rain," she floundered on. "I saw her in a window." She really could not go on, about standing there for perhaps three or four minutes, wishing with an intensity that drained her strength that she knew the woman, that she might be welcome if she went to the house and knocked on the door, wishing she could do that instead of going on to her job at the Pelican Press.</div>

<div class="line_en">The restaurant where they dined overlooked the lake, too. They had a banquet of a dinner with champagne and brandy afterward. It was the first time in her life that Therese had been a little drunk, in fact much drunker than she wanted Carol to see. Her impression of Lakeshore Drive was always to be of a broad avenue studded with mansions all resembling the White House in Washington. In the memory there would be Carol's voice, telling her about a house here and there where she had been before, and the disquieting awareness that for a while this had been Carol's world, as Rapallo, Paris, and other places Therese did not know had for a while been the frame of everything Carol did.</div>

<div class="line_en">That night, Carol sat on the edge of her bed, smoking a cigarette before they turned the light out. Therese lay in her own bed, sleepily watching her, trying to read the meaning of the restless, puzzled look in Carol's eyes that would stare at something in the room for a moment and then move on. Was it of her she thought, or of Harge, or of Rindy? Carol had asked to be called at seven tomorrow, in order to telephone Rindy before she went to school. Therese remembered their telephone conversation in Defiance. Rindy had had a fight with some other little girl, and Carol had spent fifteen minutes going over it, and trying to persuade Rindy she should take the first step and apologize. Therese still felt the effects of what she had drunk, the tingling of the champagne that drew her painfully close to Carol. If she simply asked, she thought, Carol would let her sleep tonight in the same bed with her. She wanted more than that, to kiss her, to feel their bodies next to each other's. Therese thought of the two girls she had seen in the Palermo bar. They did that, she knew, and more. And would Carol suddenly thrust her away in disgust, if she merely wanted to hold her in her arms? And would whatever affection Carol now had for her vanish in that instant? A vision of Carol's cold rebuff swept her courage clean away. It crept back humbly in the question, couldn't she ask simply to sleep in the same bed with her?</div>

She rode up in an elevator and she was acutely conscious of Carol beside her, as if she dreamed a dream in which Carol was the subject and the only figure. In the room, she lifted her suitcase from the floor to a chair, unlatched it and left it, and stood by the writing table, watching Carol. As if her emotions had been in abeyance all the past hours, or days, they flooded her now as she watched Carol opening her suitcase, taking out, as she always did first, the leather kit that contained her toilet articles, dropping it onto the bed. She looked at Carol's hands, at the lock of hair that fell over the scarf tied around her head, at the scratch she had gotten days ago across the toe of her moccasin.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a double bed. They sat up in their pajamas, drinking milk and sharing an orange that Carol was too sleepy to finish. Then Therese set the container of milk on the floor and looked at Carol who was sleeping already, on her stomach, with one arm flung up as she always went to sleep. Therese pulled out the light. Then Carol slipped her arm under her neck, and all the length of their bodies touched, fitting as if something had prearranged it. Happiness was like a green vine spreading through her, stretching fine tendrils, bearing flowers through her flesh. She had a vision of a pale-white flower, shimmering as if seen in darkness, or through water. Why did people talk of heaven, she wondered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="房里只有一张双人床。她们穿着睡衣坐下，喝着牛奶，还一起分享卡罗尔早先因为疲倦而没有吃完的柳橙。特芮丝把牛奶瓶放在地板上，看着已经睡着的卡罗尔。卡罗尔俯卧着，一只手抬高过肩，她睡着的时候总是这样。特芮丝熄了灯，接着卡罗尔的手臂滑到她的脖子下面，她们的身体紧密地贴住彼此，仿佛预先安排好的一样契合。幸福就像是绿色的藤蔓爬满她的全身，伸展纤细的卷须，从她的血肉中生出花朵。她看到一株灰白色的花朵在闪烁，好像是从黑暗中或透过水面看到的一样。她想起人们谈论天堂的原因。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Therese hoped she would not. But when she felt Carol's hand move on her shoulder, she knew she had been asleep. It was dawn now. Carol's fingers tightened in her hair, Carol kissed her on the lips, and pleasure leaped in Therese again as if it were only a continuation of the moment when Carol had slipped her arm under her neck last night. I love you, Therese wanted to say again, and then the words were erased by the tingling and terrifying pleasure that spread in waves from Carol's lips over her neck, her shoulders, that rushed suddenly, the length of her body. Her arms were tight around Carol, and she was conscious of Carol and nothing else, of Carol's hand that slid along her ribs, Carol's hair that brushed her bare breasts, and then her body too seemed to vanish in widening circles that leaped further and further, beyond where thought could follow. While a thousand memories and moments, words, the first darling, the second time Carol had met her at the store, a thousand memories of Carol's face, her voice, moments of anger and laughter flashed like the tail of a comet across her brain. And now it was pale-blue distance and space, an expanding space in which she took flight suddenly like a long arrow. The arrow seemed to cross an impossibly wide abyss with ease, seemed to arc on and on in space, and not quite to stop. Then she realized that she still clung to Carol, that she trembled violently, and the arrow was herself. She saw Carol's pale hair across her eyes, and now Carol's head was close against hers. And she did not have to ask if this were right, no one had to tell her, because this could not have been more right or perfect. She held Carol tighter against her, and felt Carol's mouth on her own smiling mouth. Therese lay still, looking at her at Carol's face only inches away from her, the gray eyes calm as she had never seen them, as if they retained some of the space she had just emerged from. And it seemed strange that it was still Carol's face, with the freckles, the bending blond eyebrow that she knew, the mouth now as calm as her eyes, as Therese had seen it many times before.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特芮丝希望她不要睡着。但她感觉到卡罗尔的手在她肩上移动时，她知道卡罗尔已经要睡着了。已经是凌晨了。卡罗尔的手在她的头发里握紧，卡罗尔吻了她的唇，愉悦之情再度跃上特芮丝心头，仿佛此刻延续了昨天晚上卡罗尔的手滑到她脖子下方的那种感觉。特芮丝想再说一次我爱你，卡罗尔的唇落在她的颈项、肩上，令人颤栗又害怕的愉悦消除了语言，急速贯穿了全身。她的双臂紧紧环绕着卡罗尔，她只感觉到卡罗尔，再也感觉不到其他事物了。她感觉到卡罗尔的手沿着她的肋骨滑动，卡罗尔的秀发拂过她赤裸的胸部，然后她的身体似乎也消失在越来越大的圆圈中。这些圆圈跳得越来越远，超出思绪可以跟随的范围。上千个回忆、时刻、字眼，第一个心爱的人，卡罗尔第二次在店里和她碰面，上千个关于卡罗尔脸孔、声音的回忆，愤怒和充满笑声的时刻在她脑中，就像彗星的尾巴一样一闪而过。而现在那是一段灰蓝色的距离和空间，一个逐渐扩展的空间。在这个空间中，她可以突然像一支长箭般往前奔去。那支箭轻而易举地横跨了宽广的、不可思议的深渊，在空间中不断拉出弧形，而且没有停止的迹象。接着她意识到自己仍然紧紧贴着卡罗尔，身体颤抖得很厉害，而那支箭就是她自己。她看到卡罗尔淡色的头发遮盖住眼睛，现在卡罗尔的头发贴着她的头。她不必去问这是对是错，也没有人可以告诉她，因为这样子再正确、再完美不过了。她把卡罗尔抱得更紧，感觉到卡罗尔的嘴贴在她自己微笑的双唇上。特芮丝一动也不动地躺着，看着她，看着只离她几厘米远的卡罗尔的脸，她从没见过她的眼睛那么平静，仿佛它们留在了她刚从中漂走的某个空间里。不过感觉很奇怪，因为这还是卡罗尔的脸，上面有雀斑，她熟悉的弯曲金色眉毛，那张嘴现在就像她的眼睛一样平静，就像特芮丝看过很多次的一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
