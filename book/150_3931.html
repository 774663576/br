<div class="line_en">But sooner or later Sister St Joseph returned to the subject of the Mother Superior. Kitty had been conscious from the beginning that the personality of this woman dominated the convent. She was regarded by all that dwelt there with love certainly and with admiration, but also with awe and not a little dread. Notwithstanding her kindliness Kitty herself felt like a schoolgirl in her presence. She was never quite at her ease with her, for she was filled with a sentiment which was so strange that it embarrassed her: reverence. Sister St Joseph, with an ingenuous desire to impress, told Kitty how great the family was to which the Mother Superior belonged; she had among her ancestors persons of historic importance and she was un peu cousine with half the kings in Europe: Alfonso of Spain had hunted at her father's, and they had chateaux all over France. It must have been hard to leave so much grandeur. Kitty listened smilingly, but not a little impressed.</div>

<div class="line_en">When they had come to this city there had been nothing. They had built the convent. The Mother Superior had made the plans and supervised the work. The moment they arrived they began to save the poor little unwanted girls from the baby-tower and the cruel hands of the midwife. At first they had had no beds to sleep in and no glass to keep out the night air ("and there is nothing," said Sister St Joseph, "which is more unwholesome"); and often they had no money left, not only to pay the builders, but even to buy their simple fare; they lived like peasants, what was she saying? the peasants in France, tenez, the men who worked for her father, would have thrown to the pigs the food they ate. And then the Mother Superior would collect her daughters round her and they would kneel and pray; and the Blessed Virgin would send money. A thousand francs would arrive by post next day, or a stranger, an Englishman (a Protestant, if you please) or even a Chinaman would knock at the door while they were actually on their knees and bring them a present. Once they were in such straits that they all made a vow to the Blessed Virgin that they would recite a neuvaine in her honour if she succoured them, and, would you believe it? that funny Mr. Waddington came to see us next day and saying that we looked as though we all wanted a good plate of roast beef gave us a hundred dollars.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="刚来到这座城市的时候，她们还什么都没有，连修道院都是自己盖起来的。修道院长设计好了修道院的蓝图，然后负责监管工程的进度。她们几乎刚落下脚就开始收留那些被父母遗弃的婴儿，这些婴儿不是被放在敛尸盒里丢掉，就是被残忍的接生婆直接扔了。起初她们连张睡觉的床也没有，窗户上也没安玻璃来挡挡夜风（“卫生些的东西，”圣约瑟姐妹说道，“更是一点也没有。”）。她们的经济状况时常捉襟见肘，不要说给泥瓦匠的工钱了，连她们自己的日常起居都难以为继。她们活得跟农民似的，嗯？不对，圣约瑟姐妹那句法语的意思是，她们吃的饭就跟给她爸爸干活的那些法国农民喂给猪吃的差不多。这时修道院长会把她的孩子们召集到身边，然后叫大家一起跪下来祈祷，圣母玛利亚就会送钱来了。可不是，第二天就会收到一千法郎的汇票。要不就是她们还跪在地上的时候，一个陌生的英国人（说新教徒也行，随你的便）甚或是一个中国人就会来敲她们的门，给她们送礼物来啦。有一回实在是撑不下去了，她们向圣母玛利亚发誓要把九日经背下来，恳请她发发慈悲，拯救她们。你说怎么着？第二天那位逗笑的韦丁顿先生就来了，他说我们的眼神看上去特别想念烤牛肉，就给了我们一百美金。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"What is wrong with his morals, ma soeur?" asked Kitty smiling.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他出了什么道德问题，姐妹？”凯蒂微笑着问道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">What a comic little man he was, with his bald head and his little shrewd eyes (ses petits yeux matins) and his jokes. Mon Dieu, how he murdered the French language, and yet you could' not help laughing at him. He was always in a good humour. All through this terrible epidemic he carried himself as if he were enjoying a holiday. He had a heart quite French and a wit so that ycu would hardly believe he was English. Except for his accent. But sometimes Sister St Joseph thought he spoke badly on purpose to make you laugh. Of course his morals were not all one could wish; but still that was his business (with a sigh, a shrug, and a shake of the head) and he was a bachelor and a young man.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他是多有趣的一个小男人啊，看他的秃头，他精明的小眼睛（那双眼睛真是诡计多端），还有他那些笑话。我的主啊，瞧他把法语糟蹋成什么样子了，可你就是得让他逗乐。他那副乐天的样子从来也不改，这可怕的瘟疫发生以来，他反而过得跟度假似的。他的性情太像法国人了，瞧瞧他的智慧，哪儿像个英国人。就是他的口音重了点儿。不过有时候圣约瑟姐妹觉得他是故意说错逗你笑呢。当然了，他在道德上是出了点问题，不过那是他自己的事儿啦（圣约瑟姐妹长叹一声，把肩一耸，直摇头）。他还是个单身汉，年纪也还轻。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Is it possible that you do not know? It is a sin for me to tell you. I have no business to say such things. He lives with a Chinese woman, that is to say, not a Chinese woman, but a Manchu. A princess, it appears, and she loves him to distraction."</div>

<div class="line_en">"No, no, I promise you, it is everything that is most true. It is very wicked of him. Those things are not done. Did you not hear, when you first came to the convent and he would not eat the madeleines that I had made expressly, that notre bonne mere said his stomach was deranged by Manchu cooking? That was what she meant and you should have seen the head that he made. It is a story altogether curious. It appears that he was stationed at Hankow during the revolution when they were massacring the Manchus and this good little Waddington saved the lives of one of their great families. They are related to the Imperial Family. The girl fell violently in love with him and -- well, the rest you can imagine. And then when he left Hankow she ran away and followed him and now she follows him everywhere, and he has had to resign himself to keep her, poor fellow, and I daresay he is very fond of her; they are quite charming sometimes, these Manchu women. But what am I thinking of I have a thousand things to do and I sit here. I am a bad religious. I am ashamed of myself."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，绝不，我敢保证，再没有比这个更千真万确的了。他有罪，真不该做那样的事。你没听到吗？你第一回来修道院的时候，他不吃我特意做的玛德琳蛋糕，我们的好嬷嬷说他的胃叫满洲菜搞坏了。她就是指的那件事，你也看见当时他的脸色了。这个故事还挺离奇的。好像是大革命的时候他在汉口待过，当时军队正在驱逐满人，好心的韦丁顿先生正好救了一家贵族的命。这家人是皇亲国戚。那个姑娘疯狂地爱上了他，然后呢，你就都能想象得到了。他离开了汉口，她也从家里跑出来跟着他。现在也是，他走到哪儿，她就跟到哪儿。他不得已让她留了下来，可怜的家伙，我敢说他非常喜欢她。有时候这些满洲女人挺漂亮的。呃，我在这儿乱说什么呢？还有一大堆事没干呢，我却还在这儿坐着。我不是一个好修女，为此我感到羞愧。”">查看中文翻译</div>
