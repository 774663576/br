<div class="line_en">Philip passed the evening wretchedly. He had told his landlady that he would not be in, so there was nothing for him to eat, and he had to go to Gatti's for dinner. Afterwards he went back to his rooms, but Griffiths on the floor above him was having a party, and the noisy merriment made his own misery more hard to bear. He went to a music-hall, but it was Saturday night and there was standing-room only: after half an hour of boredom his legs grew tired and he went home. He tried to read, but he could not fix his attention; and yet it was necessary that he should work hard. His examination in biology was in little more than a fortnight, and, though it was easy, he had neglected his lectures of late and was conscious that he knew nothing. It was only a viva, however, and he felt sure that in a fortnight he could find out enough about the subject to scrape through. He had confidence in his intelligence. He threw aside his book and gave himself up to thinking deliberately of the matter which was in his mind all the time.</div>

<div class="line_en">He reproached himself bitterly for his behaviour that evening. Why had he given her the alternative that she must dine with him or else never see him again? Of course she refused. He should have allowed for her pride. He had burnt his ships behind him. It would not be so hard to bear if he thought that she was suffering now, but he knew her too well: she was perfectly indifferent to him. If he hadn't been a fool he would have pretended to believe her story; he ought to have had the strength to conceal his disappointment and the self-control to master his temper. He could not tell why he loved her. He had read of the idealisation that takes place in love, but he saw her exactly as she was. She was not amusing or clever, her mind was common; she had a vulgar shrewdness which revolted him, she had no gentleness nor softness. As she would have put it herself, she was on the make. What aroused her admiration was a clever trick played on an unsuspecting person; to `do' somebody always gave her satisfaction. Philip laughed savagely as he thought of her gentility and the refinement with which she ate her food; she could not bear a coarse word, so far as her limited vocabulary reached she had a passion for euphemisms, and she scented indecency everywhere; she never spoke of trousers but referred to them as nether garments; she thought it slightly indelicate to blow her nose and did it in a deprecating way. She was dreadfully anaemic and suffered from the dyspepsia which accompanies that ailing. Philip was repelled by her flat breast and narrow hips, and he hated the vulgar way in which she did her hair. He loathed and despised himself for loving her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他想起晚上的事，恨不得抽自己两耳光。为什么要逼她做选择呢？为什么把话说绝，不和他吃饭就再也别见他？她当然会拒绝，假如自己当时顾及她的面子就好了。他堵上了回头路。若是她现在也郁郁寡欢，他反而不会这样痛苦。可他太了解米尔德里德，她根本不把他当回事。若是当时自己放聪明点，就会假装信了她编的谎话。他本应把自己的失望藏得严实，或者控制好脾气。他不知自己为何爱她。虽然曾经读到过爱情会让人只看到对方的优点，但是他眼中的米尔德里德却正是她本身的模样：既不幽默也不机灵，既不温柔也不娇媚；思想平庸、爱耍小聪明，一股市井小民的习气更是让人反胃。她大言不惭地说自己为了成功可以不惜一切代价。她喜欢捉弄老实人，拿别人开涮自己反倒很得意。菲利普一想起她吃东西时候那种矫揉造作的模样就狂笑不止。她无时无刻不在强装斯文，只要能从自己会的那点词儿里寻到一个委婉的说法，她就坚决不会说些粗恶的字眼儿——比如从不会说“裤子”，只说“下装”。她觉得擤鼻涕是很不雅的行为，每次做都要摆出满不情愿的样子。她患有严重的贫血，消化也不好，看起来总是病怏怏、没精打采。菲利普讨厌她毫无起伏的胸脯和薄薄的两片嘴唇，讨厌她把头发梳得这么俗气。他痛恨、鄙视自己爱上了她。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The fact remained that he was helpless. He felt just as he had felt sometimes in the hands of a bigger boy at school. He had struggled against the superior strength till his own strength was gone, and he was rendered quite powerless -- he remembered the peculiar languor he had felt in his limbs, almost as though he were paralysed -- so that he could not help himself at all. He might have been dead. He felt just that same weakness now. He loved the woman so that he knew he had never loved before. He did not mind her faults of person or of character, he thought he loved them too: at all events they meant nothing to him. It did not seem himself that was concerned; he felt that he had been seized by some strange force that moved him against his will, contrary to his interests; and because he had a passion for freedom he hated the chains which bound him. He laughed at himself when he thought how often he had longed to experience the overwhelming passion. He cursed himself because he had given way to it. He thought of the beginnings; nothing of all this would have happened if he had not gone into the shop with Dunsford. The whole thing was his own fault. Except for his ridiculous vanity he would never have troubled himself with the ill-mannered slut.</div>

<div class="line_en">At all events the occurrences of that evening had finished the whole affair. Unless he was lost to all sense of shame he could not go back. He wanted passionately to get rid of the love that obsessed him; it was degrading and hateful. He must prevent himself from thinking of her. In a little while the anguish he suffered must grow less. His mind went back to the past. He wondered whether Emily Wilkinson and Fanny Price had endured on his account anything like the torment that he suffered now. He felt a pang of remorse.</div>

<div class="line_en">He slept very badly. The next day was Sunday, and he worked at his biology. He sat with the book in front of him, forming the words with his lips in order to fix his attention, but he could remember nothing. He found his thoughts going back to Mildred every minute, and he repeated to himself the exact words of the quarrel they had had. He had to force himself back to his book. He went out for a walk. The streets on the South side of the river were dingy enough on week-days, but there was an energy, a coming and going, which gave them a sordid vivacity; but on Sundays, with no shops open, no carts in the roadway, silent and depressed, they were indescribably dreary. Philip thought that day would never end. But he was so tired that he slept heavily, and when Monday came he entered upon life with determination. Christmas was approaching, and a good many of the students had gone into the country for the short holiday between the two parts of the winter session; but Philip had refused his uncle's invitation to go down to Blackstable. He had given the approaching examination as his excuse, but in point of fact he had been unwilling to leave London and Mildred. He had neglected his work so much that now he had only a fortnight to learn what the curriculum allowed three months for. He set to work seriously. He found it easier each day not to think of Mildred. He congratulated himself on his force of character. The pain he suffered was no longer anguish, but a sort of soreness, like what one might be expected to feel if one had been thrown off a horse and, though no bones were broken, were bruised all over and shaken. Philip found that he was able to observe with curiosity the condition he had been in during the last few weeks. He analysed his feelings with interest. He was a little amused at himself. One thing that struck him was how little under those circumstances it mattered what one thought; the system of personal philosophy, which had given him great satisfaction to devise, had not served him. He was puzzled by this.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一夜愁眠。第二天是礼拜天，他决定复习生物。书摊在眼前，为集中注意力嚅嚅默念，却一个字也看不进去。没有一刻不在想米尔德里德，想着和她争吵时说的每句话。他强迫自己埋头看书，可是心里乱成麻。干脆出去走走。平时上班的时候，泰晤士南岸的大街虽说又脏又乱，但熙熙攘攘的往来人群却为它注入一种并不光彩的活力。一到周日，商铺关了门，街上也不见马车经过，净是一片萧条寂静、凄凄惨惨。菲利普觉得这一天太难熬，像永远也熬不过去。可走累了，晚上竟睡得昏沉，一觉醒来他决定毅然开始新的生活。圣诞马上到了，很多学生都回乡下休短假，伯伯也叫菲利普回布莱克斯塔布尔一起过节，但被他以马上要考试的借口婉拒了。其实他只是不想离开伦敦，不想离开米尔德里德。课业已经落下了太多，别人三个月学的东西他要用两个礼拜补回来。他开始认真复习，现在整整一天不去想米尔德里德也不再那么困难了。他很庆幸自己有如此坚定的意志，之前忍受的痛苦现在已经淡了许多，就像从马背上掉下来的人，尽管没有摔断骨头，但还是跌得浑身青肿。他现在可以冷静而饶有兴趣地回首过去几个礼拜自己所陷入的情境，还能把心中品尝过的所有滋味细细整理分析一番。他不禁为自己哑然失笑。忽然意识到在那样的情形下，理智是不足以支配行为的啊。之前深以为傲的一套个人哲学体系也完全没有派上什么用场。他觉得很是不解。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then came the day of his examination. Philip, when his turn arrived, went forward to the examiner's table with the utmost confidence. He answered three or four questions. Then they showed him various specimens; he had been to very few lectures and, as soon as he was asked about things which he could not learn from books, he was floored. He did what he could to hide his ignorance, the examiner did not insist, and soon his ten minutes were over. He felt certain he had passed; but next day, when he went up to the examination buildings to see the result posted on the door, he was astounded not to find his number among those who had satisfied the examiners. In amazement he read the list three times. Dunsford was with him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="终于到了考试那天。轮到菲利普，他信心十足地走到考官桌前，回答了三四个问题。考官拿出几个标本提问。他没去上过几节课，所以一遇到书本外的知识很快就露了馅。他使尽浑身解数装得什么都懂，考官也没再深究，十分钟的考试很快就结束了。他觉得自己一定能过，谁想第二天考试楼的门上就张贴出成绩单，在通过考试者的学号里找了又找，始终没有看到自己。他愕然地把成绩单从头到尾看了三遍。邓斯福站在他身边，说：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But sometimes in the street he would see a girl who looked so like Mildred that his heart seemed to stop beating. Then he could not help himself, he hurried on to catch her up, eager and anxious, only to find that it was a total stranger. Men came back from the country, and he went with Dunsford to have tea at an A. B. C. shop. The well-known uniform made him so miserable that he could not speak. The thought came to him that perhaps she had been transferred to another establishment of the firm for which she worked, and he might suddenly find himself face to face with her. The idea filled him with panic, so that he feared Dunsford would see that something was the matter with him: he could not think of anything to say; he pretended to listen to what Dunsford was talking about; the conversation maddened him; and it was all he could do to prevent himself from crying out to Dunsford for Heaven's sake to hold his tongue.</div>

<div class="line_en">He was very anxious to pretend he did not mind, and on their way back along The Embankment insisted on talking of indifferent things. Dunsford good-naturedly wanted to discuss the causes of Philip's failure, but Philip was obstinately casual. He was horribly mortified; and the fact that Dunsford, whom he looked upon as a very pleasant but quite stupid fellow, had passed made his own rebuff harder to bear. He had always been proud of his intelligence, and now he asked himself desperately whether he was not mistaken in the opinion he held of himself. In the three months of the winter session the students who had joined in October had already shaken down into groups, and it was clear which were brilliant, which were clever or industrious, and which were `rotters.' Philip was conscious that his failure was a surprise to no one but himself. It was tea-time, and he knew that a lot of men would be having tea in the basement of the Medical School: those who had passed the examination would be exultant, those who disliked him would look at him with satisfaction, and the poor devils who had failed would sympathise with him in order to receive sympathy. His instinct was not to go near the hospital for a week, when the affair would be no more thought of, but, because he hated so much to go just then, he went: he wanted to inflict suffering upon himself. He forgot for the moment his maxim of life to follow his inclinations with due regard for the policeman round the corner; or, if he acted in accordance with it, there must have been some strange morbidity in his nature which made him take a grim pleasure in self-torture.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="沿着泰晤士河往回走的路上，他急着装出对成绩毫不在意的样子，故意扯着些无关紧要的事。好心的邓斯福想问问他这次考试失利到底是因为什么，可他固执地绝口不提。他觉得很羞耻，因为邓斯福在自己眼中一直是个成天乐呵呵、脑子少根筋的蠢货，连他都能通过的考试自己却不及格，简直让人难以接受。他一直觉得自己聪明，还以此洋洋自得，可现在不禁怀疑，难道一直以来都看错自己了？上了三个月学之后，十月入校的这些学生们水平如何已经各见分晓了，谁脑袋灵光，谁有点小聪明，谁特别刻苦，谁是来滥竽充数的，一切都一目了然。菲利普发现除了自己之外，谁也没觉得他这次不及格是意料之外的事。到了喝茶的时间，他猜想要是自己去了医学院地下室的茶馆，无非能见到这么几种人：考过了的一脸得意，脑门放光；不喜欢他的看他来了便交头接耳，窃笑不停；同样不及格的则要凑上来嘘寒问暖一阵，指望着能从他这也听到些同情话儿。他本能地想躲一个礼拜，等这事风平浪静了再去学校。可他不愿就这么避开人群，所以最后还是硬着头皮走了进去。他有意要让自己受点折磨。这一刻，他似乎忘了在不惊动警察的情况下，做事要随心所欲的人生信条。或者说，如果他遵循了这一信条，那一定是因为自我折磨给他带来了某种病态的愉悦感。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But later on, when he had endured the ordeal to which he forced himself, going out into the night after the noisy conversation in the smoking-room, he was seized with a feeling of utter loneliness. He seemed to himself absurd and futile. He had an urgent need of consolation, and the temptation to see Mildred was irresistible. He thought bitterly that there was small chance of consolation from her; but he wanted to see her even if he did not speak to her; after all, she was a waitress and would be obliged to serve him. She was the only person in the world he cared for. There was no use in hiding that fact from himself. Of course it would be humiliating to go back to the shop as though nothing had happened, but he had not much self-respect left. Though he would not confess it to himself, he had hoped each day that she would write to him; she knew that a letter addressed to the hospital would find him; but she had not written: it was evident that she cared nothing if she saw him again or not. And he kept on repeating to himself:</div>
