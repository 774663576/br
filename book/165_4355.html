<div class="line_en">But Cheng Xin soon realized that the lights inside the cabin came from different fixtures than before -- perhaps these were backups designed specifically for reduced-lightspeed use. There were no information windows in the air. It was possible that the reduced lightspeed meant such holographic displays were no longer operable. The interface of the neural computer was limited to that flat screen, which now resembled a color bitmap display from the Common Era.</div>

<div class="line_en">It took a long time to wake up. Cheng Xin recovered her awareness gradually. After her memory and sight came back, she knew right away that the neural computer had booted successfully. A soft light illuminated the inside of the cabin, and she could hear the machines humming reassuringly. The air was warm. The shuttle had been revived.</div>

<div class="line_en">Since she had recovered enough to move her hands, Cheng Xin unstrapped herself and drifted next to Yifan to look at the screen with him, their space suits squeezed tightly side by side. Several windows were up on the screen, each showing rapidly scrolling numbers: diagnostics on the shuttle's various systems. Yifan told Cheng Xin that he had established contact with Hunter, whose neural computer had also apparently booted successfully.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="程心用刚刚恢复知觉的手解开安全带，飘浮到关一帆身边，同他一起观看屏幕。他们都穿着太空服，但都没戴头盔，太空服紧紧挤在一起。屏幕上同时开着几个窗口，里面都滚动着大量的数据，正寸穿梭机的各个系统进行检测。关一帆告诉程心，他已经与“亨特”号取得了联系，那里的神经元计算机也已经正常启动。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The bottle felt warm. Cheng Xin saw that she wasn't wearing gloves, either. She realized that although she was still wearing the primitive space suit, her helmet had been removed. The temperature and pressure inside the cabin were comfortable.</div>

<div class="line_en">At first, the universe didn't appear to have changed from what she had seen before: The ship continued to orbit around Planet Blue at reduced lightspeed; the two star clusters, blue and red, continued to change their shapes erratically at the two ends of the universe; the sun continued to dance madly between being a line and a circle; and color patches continued to whip across Planet Blue's surface. When Cheng Xin tried to match her gaze to the rapidly flowing surface of Planet Blue, she finally noticed something different: the blue and white patches had been replaced by purple ones.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="乍一看，外面的宇宙并没有明显的变化，仍然是在蓝星轨道上以低光速运行时看到的景象，蓝色和红色两个星团仍然在宇宙的两极飘忽不定地变幻着形状，太阳仍在直线和球体之间狂舞着，蓝星的表面也仍然飞快地流动着周期性的色块。当用目光飞快地追踪那些色块时，程心发现了一个变化：在色块的颜色中，蓝色和白色消失了，取而代之的是紫色。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"The fusion drive still works?" Cheng Xin asked. Before they entered hibernation, this question had weighed on her mind. She had not asked because she knew that she was likely to receive a disappointing answer, and she didn't want to give Yifan more to worry about.</div>

<div class="line_en">"We're out of lightspeed," Guan Yifan said. He pressed a button, and the screens over the two portholes retracted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们脱离光速了。”关一帆说，按动舱壁上的一个按钮，同时打开了两个舷窗。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Half an hour later, the shuttle and Hunter both activated their antimatter engines and began decelerating. Cheng Xin and Guan Yifan were pressed against their seats by the hypergravity, and the porthole screens rose to block out the outside. Violent jolts seized the shuttle, but gradually subsided. The deceleration process took less than twenty minutes. Then the engines shut off, and they were again weightless.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="半个小时后，穿梭机和“亨特”号飞船同时启动反物质发动机，开始减速。程心和关一帆被超重紧紧压在座椅上，舷窗已经关上了。剧烈的震动出现了，随后渐渐平息，最后完全消失了，减速仅仅持续了十几分钟，然后发动机停止，失重再次出现。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Through the portholes, Cheng Xin saw that the blue and red star clusters were gone, and the sun was now a normal sun. But the sight of Planet Blue in the porthole on the other side surprised her: Planet Blue was now "Planet Purple." Other than the ocean, which was still a light yellow, the rest of the planet was covered by purple -- even the snow was gone. She was, however, most shocked by the appearance of space itself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="透过舷窗，程心看到蓝红两个星团消失了。她看到了太阳，这是一个正常的太阳，与以前看到的没有明显变化。但当她从另一侧的舷窗中看到蓝星时却吃了一惊，蓝星已经变成紫星了，除了仍是淡黄色的海洋外，陆地均被紫色所覆盖，雪的白色也完全消失了。最令她震惊的是星空。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I think they're stars," repeated Yifan. "A star's light must pass through two interfaces before getting to us: First, it must go through the interface between regular lightspeed and reduced lightspeed, and then through the event horizon of the black hole. That's why the stars look so strange to us now."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，我们在光墓里。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">All the stars in space had turned into thin lines of light. Cheng Xin was actually familiar with such a sight: She had seen plenty of long-exposure photographs taken of the starry sky from Earth. Due to the Earth's rotation, the stars in the pictures all became concentric arcs of approximately the same length. But now, the stars she saw were segments of different lengths and aligned every which way. The longest few lines, in fact, took up almost a third of the sky. These lines crossed each other at different angles and made space appear far more confusing and chaotic than before.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="太空中的星星都变成了发光的细线。线状的星星程心似曾相识，她曾经多次见过长时间曝光的星空照片，由于地球的转动，照片上的星星都成了线段，它们的长短和方向都一样。但现在，星星变成的线长短不一，方向也不一样，最长的几根亮线几乎贯穿了三分之一的太空，这些亮线以种种角度相互交错，使星空看上去比以前迷乱了许多。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The DX3906 solar system was now a reduced-lightspeed black hole completely sealed off from the rest of the universe. The starry sky woven by the multitude of crisscrossing silver threads was a dream that could be seen but would never be achieved.</div>

<div class="line_en">The purple continents took up most of the view from the monitoring system. They were able to confirm that the purple was due to the color of the vegetation. The change in the sun's radiation had probably caused the plants on Planet Blue to change from blue to purple as they evolved to adapt to the new light.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在监视画面中，紫色的大陆占据了全部视野，现在可以肯定紫色是植物的颜色。蓝星的植物由蓝变紫可能是因为太阳的光辐射改变所致，为了适应新的光照，它们变成了紫色。">查看中文翻译</div>

As they approached the surface, they saw a dense purple forest at the landing spot. Just when the shuttle was about to lift off again in search of a more open spot, the trees dashed away to escape the flames from the shuttle's thrusters. The shuttle then gently set itself down in the open space vacated by the fleeing trees.</div>

<div class="line_en">Cheng Xin and Guan Yifan exited the shuttle and once again stepped onto the surface of Planet Blue. Warm, moist air welcomed them, and a layer of soft, bouncy humus covered the ground. The soil around them was filled with numerous holes left by the roots of the trees that had gotten out of the way. Those trees now huddled around the clearing, their broad leaves rustling in the breeze, like a crowd of whispering giants gathered around them. The clearing was completely covered by their shade. Such dense vegetation made Planet Blue a completely different world than the one they had seen before.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="程心和关一帆走出穿梭机，再次踏上蓝星的大地。温暖湿润的空气扑面而来，地面上铺着一层腐殖叶，十分松软。在这片空地上布满了孔洞，那是刚才逃开的大树的根须留下的。那些紫树现在挤在空地的周围，阔大的叶子在风中摇摆，像一群围着他们窃窃私语的巨人；空地完全处于树荫中。如此茂密的植被，与上次见到的蓝星已经是两个世界了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Cheng Xin didn't like purple.

<div class="line_en">Yifan returned to the shuttle and established a link with Hunter, which was still in near-ground orbit. Hunter's neural computer was very powerful, and its AI was capable of direct natural language communications. Under reduced-lightspeed conditions, the conversation from ground to space suffered a transmission delay of over ten seconds. After dropping out of lightspeed along with the shuttle, Hunter had been scanning the surface of the planet from low orbit. By now, it had completed a survey of most of the land on Planet Blue, and it had discovered no trace of humans or signs of any other intelligent life.</div>

They clearly remembered that there had been rolling mountains nearby, but now the forest was growing over a plain. They went back to the shuttle to confirm that the coordinates were really correct -- they were. Then they looked even more carefully all around them, but still found no trace of any prior human visit.

<div class="line_en">While waiting for the test results, Cheng Xin and Guan Yifan left the shuttle and waited in the clearing. Sunlight illuminated the clearing through gaps in the canopy. Many strange, small creatures flitted through: Some were insects with spinning rotors on top like helicopters; others were like tiny, transparent balloons that drifted through the air, giving off a rainbow sheen as they passed through shafts of sunlight; but none of them had wings.</div>

<div class="line_en">Next, Cheng Xin and Guan Yifan had to turn to a task that terrified them but was absolutely necessary: determining how much time had elapsed in this frame of reference. There was a special technique for radiometric dating under reduced-lightspeed conditions: Some elements that did not decay under normal lightspeed decayed at different rates under reduced lightspeed, which could be used to precisely tell the passage of time. Given its scientific mission, the shuttle was equipped with a device for measuring atomic decay, but the instrument required a computer for processing. Yifan had to go to some trouble to connect the instrument to the neural computer on the shuttle. They directed the instrument to test the ten rock samples taken from different parts of the planet one after another so that the results could be compared. The assay required half an hour.</div>

<div class="line_en">Cheng Xin sobbed her heart out over Yifan's shoulder. In her memories, she had cried like this only once before, when Tianming's brain had been taken out of his body. That was… 18,903,729 years plus six centuries ago, and those six centuries were but a rounding error at such geologic timescales. This time, she cried not only for Tianming. She cried out of a sense of surrender. She finally understood how she was but a mote of dust in a grand wind, a small leaf drifting over a broad river. She surrendered completely and allowed the wind to pass through her, allowed the sunlight to pierce her soul.</div>

<div class="line_en">They sat on the yielding humus and continued to hold each other, letting time flow by. The dappled sunlight gently shifted around them as the planet continued to rotate. Sometimes Cheng Xin asked herself, Has another ten million years passed by? A small, rational part of her mind strangely whispered to her that such a thing was possible: There really were worlds where one could step through a thousand years at will. Consider the death lines: If they ruptured and expanded just a bit, the speed of light within would rise from zero to an extremely small number, like the rate at which continents drifted over the ocean: a centimeter for every ten thousand years. In such a world, if you got up from your lover and walked a few steps away, you would be separated from him by ten million years.</div>

<div class="line_en">Hunter's AI invoked the geological expert system to interpret the results. They found out that the giant characters had initially been carved into the surface of a large sedimentary rock formation on the side of a mountain. The original surface was about 130 square meters. Over the eons, the mountain on which the rock had been located sank, and that was how the carved rock ended up below them. More than four lines of text had been carved into it, but the lower portion of the rock had been broken up during the geological transformations and all the text there lost.

It moved through the air, but did not go far before returning to its original position. It was possible that it had been there all along, but the outline was so faint and thin that it was invisible during daytime.
