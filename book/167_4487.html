<div class="line_en">They had been singing in the sept all morning, since the first report of enemy sails had reached the castle. The sound of their voices mingled with the whicker of horses, the clank of steel, and the groaning hinges of the great bronze gates to make a strange and fearful music. In the sept they sing for the Mother's mercy but on the walls it's the Warrior they pray to, and all in silence. She remembered how Septa Mordane used to tell them that the Warrior and the Mother were only two faces of the same great god. But if there is only one, whose prayers will be heard?</div>

<div class="line_en">He had never sounded more like a stupid little boy. Sansa touched her lips to the metal, thinking that she would kiss any number of swords sooner than Joffrey.

<div class="line_en">Only if one of your Kingsguard kills him for you. Three of the White Swords would go with Joffrey and his uncle: Ser Meryn, Ser Mandon, and Ser Osmund Kettleblack. "Will you lead your knights into battle?" Sansa asked, hoping.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sansa had never seen the sept so crowded, nor so brightly lit; great shafts of rainbow-colored sunlight slanted down through the crystals in the high windows, and candles burned on every side, their little flames twinkling like stars. The Mother's altar and the Warrior's swam in light, but Smith and Crone and Maid and Father had their worshipers as well, and there were even a few flames dancing below the Stranger's halfhuman face… for what was Stannis Baratheon, if not the Stranger come to judge them? Sansa visited each of the Seven in turn, lighting a candle at each altar, and then found herself a place on the benches between a wizened old washer woman and a boy no older than Rickon, dressed in the fine linen tunic of a knight's son. The old woman's hand was bony and hard with callus, the boy's small and soft, but it was good to have someone to hold on to. The air was hot and heavy, smelling of incense and sweat, crystal-kissed and candle-bright; it made her dizzy to breathe it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="珊莎没见过圣堂如此拥挤，也没见过它如此明亮：巨大的七彩光束透过水晶高窗斜射进来，四周燃满蜡烛，火焰如群星一般闪烁。不仅圣母和战士的祭坛沐浴在光辉中，铁匠、老妪、少女和天父的祭坛前也摆满蜡烛，甚至陌客那张似人非人的脸孔下也有若干焰火舞动…他们应该自救，史坦尼斯·拜拉席恩不就是来审判他们的陌客吗？珊莎依次参拜七座祭坛，分别点亮一根蜡烛，然后在长凳上找个位置，坐在一个枯瘦的洗衣老妇和一个年纪与瑞肯相仿的小男孩中间。男孩穿着精纺亚麻布外衣，看来是骑士之子。老妇的手瘦骨嶙岣，长满硬茧，男孩的手则又小又软，但握着它们让她心安。空气闷热凝重，映着水晶与烛光的照耀，混合着熏香和汗水的味道，令她头晕目眩。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She knew the hymn; her mother had taught it to her once, a long time ago in Winterfell. She joined her voice to theirs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这首正在吟唱的圣歌她是知道的；很久很久之前，在临冬城，母亲曾经教过她。于是她加入合唱：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Across the city, thousands had jammed into the Great Sept of Baelor on Visenya's Hill, and they would be singing too, their voices swelling out over the city, across the river, and up into the sky. Surely the gods must hear us, she thought.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="城市彼端，成千上万的人拥入维桑尼亚丘陵上的贝勒大圣堂。他们也在唱歌，声音溢出城外，越过河流，响彻云霄。诸神一定会听到我们的呼声，她心想。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Gentle Mother, font of mercy, save our sons from war, we pray, stay the swords and stay the arrows, let them know a better day. Gentle Mother, strength of women, help our daughters through this fray, soothe the wrath and tame the fury, teach us all a kinder way.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="温柔的圣母，慈悲的源泉，保佑您的儿子穿越鏖战，止住流矢，抵挡刀剑，让他们看见美好的明天。温柔的圣母，妇人的希望，帮助您的女儿不受苦难，平息怒火，驯服狂乱，教导我们彼此宽容相待。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sansa knew most of the hymns, and followed along on those she did not know as best she could. She sang along with grizzled old serving men and anxious young wives, with serving girls and soldiers, cooks and falconers, knights and knaves, squires and spit boys and nursing mothers. She sang with those inside the castle walls and those without, sang with all the city. She sang for mercy, for the living and the dead alike, for Bran and Rickon and Robb, for her sister Arya and her bastard brother Jon Snow, away off on the Wall. She sang for her mother and her father, for her grandfather Lord Hoster and her uncle Edmure Tully, for her friend Jeyne Poole, for old drunken King Robert, for Septa Mordane and Ser Dontos and Jory Cassel and Maester Luwin, for all the brave knights and soldiers who would die today, and for the children and the wives who would mourn them, and finally, toward the end, she even sang for Tyrion the Imp and for the Hound. He is no true knight but he saved me all the same, she told the Mother. Save him if you can, and gentle the rage inside him. But when the septon climbed on high and called upon the gods to protect and defend their true and noble king, Sansa got to her feet. The aisles were jammed with people. She had to shoulder through while the septon called upon the Smith to lend strength to Joffrey's sword and shield, the Warrior to give him courage, the Father to defend him in his need. Let his sword break and his shield shatter, Sansa thought coldly as she shoved out through the doors, let his courage fail him and every man desert him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大部分的圣歌珊莎都知道旋律，就算不会的，也尽量跟着一起唱。她跟头发斑白的老仆和忧心忡忡的少妇一起唱，跟女佣和士兵一起唱，跟厨师和司鹰骑士和仆人，侍从、厨房小弟和奶妈们一起唱。她跟城墙之内与之外的人一起唱，跟整个城市一起唱。她为诸神的慈悲而唱，为生者与死人而唱，为布兰、瑞肯和罗柏而唱，为妹妹艾莉亚和远在长城的私生子哥哥琼恩·雪诺而唱。她为父母双亲而唱，为外公霍斯特公爵和舅舅艾德慕·徒利爵士而唱，为她的朋友珍妮·普尔、酒鬼老王劳勃、茉丹修女、唐托斯爵士、乔里·凯索和鲁温学士而唱。她为今天要战死的英勇骑士和果敢士兵而唱，为那些将悼念他们的孤儿和遗孀而唱，最后，到了末尾，她甚至为小恶魔提利昂和猎狗而唱。他不是真正的骑士，但他救了我，她告诉圣母。求求您，请您保佑他，并平息他胸中的怒火。但等修士上台，呼唤诸神保佑他们真正的、高贵的国王时，珊莎站了起来。过道里全是人，她用尽全力才能挤过去，她一边用力，一边听见修士祈求铁匠赋予乔佛里的剑盾以神力，祈求战士赐他勇气，祈求天父在危机时刻保护他。愿他剑折盾破，珊莎冷冷地想，一边赶紧出门，愿他六神无主，为世人所唾弃。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was another sort of song, a terrible song. Sansa pulled the hood of her cloak up over her ears, and hurried toward Maegor's Holdfast, the castle-within-a-castle where the queen had promised they would all be safe. At the foot of the drawbridge, she came upon Lady Tanda and her two daughters. Falyse had arrived yesterday from Castle Stokeworth with a small troop of soldiers. She was trying to coax her sister onto the bridge, but Lollys clung to her maid, sobbing, "I don't want to, I don't want to, I don't want to."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是另一首歌，一首可怕的歌。珊莎拉起兜帽，掩住双耳，匆忙往梅葛楼赶去，太后保证大家在这座城中之城中很安全。她在吊桥边遇到坦妲伯爵夫人和她两个女儿。法丽丝昨天刚从史铎克渥斯堡带着一小队士兵赶到，此刻正好说歹说哄妹妹上桥，但洛丽丝死命扣住她的女仆，泣道：“不要，不要，不要。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A few guards paced along on the gatehouse battlements, but otherwise the castle seemed empty. Sansa stopped and listened. Away off, she could hear the sounds of battle. The singing almost drowned them out, but the sounds were there if you had the ears to hear: the deep moan of warhorns, the creak and thud of catapults flinging stones, the splashes and splinterings, the crackle of burning pitch and thrum of scorpions loosing their yard-long iron-headed shafts… and beneath it all, the cries of dying men.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="除了几个在城门楼边巡逻的卫兵，整个城堡空寂无人。珊莎驻足聆听，听到远处战斗的声音，歌声几乎将它们盖过，但若仔细倾听，其实一直都在：战号的低吟，投石机的甩动和撞击，水花溅起，木头碎裂，燃烧的沥青桶噼啪作响，弩炮射出一码长的铁头箭…这一切之下，是活人濒死的呼号。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Queen's Ballroom was not a tenth the size of the castle's Great Hall, only half as big as the Small Hall in the Tower of the Hand, but it could still seat a hundred, and it made up in grace what it lacked in space. Beaten silver mirrors backed every wall sconce, so the torches burned twice as bright; the walls were paneled in richly carved wood, and sweet-smelling rushes covered the floors. From the gallery above drifted down the merry strains of pipes and fiddle. A line of arched windows ran along the south wall, but they had been closed off with heavy draperies. Thick velvet hangings admitted no thread of light, and would muffle the sound of prayer and war alike. It makes no matter, Sansa thought. The war is with us.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="太后的舞厅不及城堡大厅的十分之一，也只有首相塔里小厅的一半大，但坐下一百人没问题。空间虽不大，布置却极典雅。每个火炬托架后都有磨平的大银镜，因此光亮成了两倍；墙上镂着精致的木雕，清香的灯芯草覆盖地板。楼座上飘来长笛和提琴轻快的旋律。南墙排列着一排拱窗，却被厚重的天鹅绒幔布遮掩，透不过一丝光线，也隔离了祈祷与战斗的声音。没有差别，珊莎心想，战争已与我们同在。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Almost every highborn woman in the city sat at the long trestle tables, along with a handful of old men and young boys. The women were wives, daughters, mothers, and sisters. Their men had gone out to fight Lord Stannis. Many would not return. The air was heavy with the knowledge. As Joffrey's betrothed, Sansa had the seat of honor on the queen's right hand. She was climbing the dais when she saw the man standing in the shadows by the back wall. He wore a long hauberk of oiled black mail, and held his sword before him: her father's greatsword, Ice, near as tall as he was. Its point rested on the floor, and his hard bony fingers curled around the crossguard on either side of the grip. Sansa's breath caught in her throat. Ser Ilyn Payne seemed to sense her stare. He turned his gaunt, pox-ravaged face toward her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="城里几乎所有贵族仕女都坐在长桌边，还有几位老先生和小男孩。这些女人是妻子，是女儿，是母亲，也是姐妹。她们的男人出发跟史坦尼斯公爵作战，多半一去不回。气氛凝重，人人悲哀。身为乔佛里的未婚妻，珊莎有一个尊贵的座位，就在太后右手。登上高台时，她看到那个站在后墙阴影里的男人。他身穿一件长长的、刚上油的黑锁甲，手握巨剑——那是父亲的“寒冰”！几乎跟他人一样高。剑尖着地，剑柄紧攫在瘦长冷硬的指头中，双手交握。珊莎摒住呼吸，心提到嗓子眼。伊林·派恩似乎感觉到她的凝视，瘦长的麻子脸转过来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What is he doing here?" she asked Osfryd Kettleblack. He captained the queen's new red cloak guard.</div>

<div class="line_en">"All rise for Her Grace, Cersei of House Lannister, Queen Regent and Protector of the Realm," the royal steward cried.</div>

<div class="line_en">Cersei's gown was snowy linen, white as the cloaks of the Kingsguard. Her long dagged sleeves showed a lining of gold satin. Masses of bright yellow hair tumbled to her bare shoulders in thick curls. Around her slender neck hung a rope of diamonds and emeralds. The white made her look strangely innocent, almost maidenly, but there were points of color on her cheeks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="瑟曦穿一件雪白的亚麻布裙服，白如御林铁卫的袍子，长长的拖袖露出金绸衬底，浓密的明黄卷发披在裸露的肩头，纤细的脖子上挂一条钻石和祖母绿的项链。这身白衣让她有种奇特的纯真，除了脸上有些色斑，真的跟少女一样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Be seated," the queen said when she had taken her place on the dais, "and be welcome." Osfryd Kettleblack held her chair; a page performed the same service for Sansa. "You look pale, Sansa," Cersei observed. "Is your red flower still blooming?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“请坐，”太后在高台上就位之后道，“欢迎各位光临。”奥斯佛利·凯特布莱克替她扶住椅子，一名侍童则为珊莎服务。“你看上去脸色不太好，珊莎，”瑟曦说，“初潮还在继续？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"How apt. The men will bleed out there, and you in here." The queen signaled for the first course to be served.</div>

<div class="line_en">The queen glanced at the mute headsman. "To deal with treason, and to defend us if need be. He was a knight before he was a headsman." She pointed her spoon toward the end of the hall, where the tall wooden doors had been closed and barred. "When the axes smash down those doors, you may be glad of him."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="太后瞥了一眼沉默的刽子手，“为惩办叛徒，必要时也保护我们。你知道吗？成为刽子手之前，他原本是个骑士。”她拿汤匙指指舞厅尽头，高大的木门已经紧闭，并上了闩。“当它被利斧劈开时，你就会庆幸他在这儿了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I would be gladder if it were the Hound, Sansa thought. Harsh as he was, she did not believe Sandor Clegane would let any harm come to her. "Won't your guards protect us?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="猎狗在这儿，我才会庆幸，珊莎想。桑铎·克里冈虽然粗暴，却很厉害，她坚信他不会让自己受到任何伤害。“是啊，还有您的卫兵呢，他们也在保护我们。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"And who will protect us from my guards?" The queen gave Osfryd a sideways look. "Loyal sellswords are rare as virgin whores. If the battle is lost my guards will trip on those crimson cloaks in their haste to rip them off. They'll steal what they can and flee, along with the serving men, washer women, and stableboys, all out to save their own worthless hides. Do you have any notion what happens when a city is sacked, Sansa? No, you wouldn't, would you? All you know of life you learned from singers, and there's such a dearth of good sacking songs."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哼，你应该担心的是谁来保护我们不受这些卫兵的伤害！”太后横了奥斯佛利一眼。“上天入地，你找不到贞洁的妓女，也找不到忠诚的佣兵。如果战斗失利，我的卫兵会十万火急地扒下身上红袍，偷走能偷的东西，一走了之。这些仆人，洗衣妇，马夫…统统都一样，他们首先考虑的是自己那副毫无价值的臭皮囊。珊莎，你有没有一点概念，被洗劫的城市是什么样子？不，你什么都不知道，对不对？你对生活的认识全部来自于歌手，而没有一首歌会赞颂苦痛与不公。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"True knights would never harm women and children." The words rang hollow in her ears even as she said them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“真正的骑士会保护妇女和儿童。”她一边说，一边觉得这些话好空洞。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"True knights." The queen seemed to find that wonderfully amusing. "No doubt you're right. So why don't you just eat your broth like a good girl and wait for Symeon Star-Eyes and Prince Aemon the Dragonknight to come rescue you, sweetling. I'm sure it won't be very long now."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“真正的骑士。”太后似乎颇感有趣。“当然啰，你说得对。你干嘛不当个乖女孩，好好喝你的汤，等着‘星眼’赛米恩和龙骑士伊蒙王子来救你呢？亲爱的，不用怀疑，那个时刻就要到了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
