<div class="line_en">They were able to see out in all directions. There was no place to go. The mountain was surrounded by desert.</div>

<div class="line_en">Zero stared at Big Thumb. "It must have a hole in it," he said, "filled with water."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="零蛋盯着大拇指。“里面一定有个洞，”他说，“装满了水。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He remembered when he had first carried Zero up the hill, how the air had smelled bitter. It was the smell of thousands of onions, growing and rotting and sprouting.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他还记得刚背零蛋上山时，空气中弥散的味道是多少刺鼻。那是成千上万的洋葱生长、腐烂、重新发芽的味道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Where else could the water be coming from?" Zero asked. "Water doesn't run uphill."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“要不然水是从哪里冒出来的？”零蛋问道，“水不能倒流回山上。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was still the best hole digger around.</div>

<div class="line_en">They had been completely around Big Thumb. It was like a giant sundial. They followed the shade.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们终于到了大拇指峰下。它就像一个巨大的日晷。他们沿着它的阴影前行。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That's the last hole I will ever dig," he declared, throwing down the shovel.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这是我挖的最后一个洞。”他宣布完就扔掉了铲子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Stanley smiled. He wished it were true, but he knew they had no choice but to eventually return to Camp Green Lake. They couldn't live on onions forever.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯坦利笑了。他希望这是真的，可是他明白最终他们别无选择，还是得回翠湖营。他们不能永远靠洋葱度日。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Zero became strong enough to help dig the hole. When he finished, it was over six feet deep. He filled the bottom with rocks to help separate the water from the dirt.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="零蛋已经恢复得差不多，可以帮忙挖洞了。他挖完后，洞就足有六英尺深了。他在洞底放了几块石头，这样能把水里的泥土过滤掉。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I'd say about a week," said Stanley. "And we probably each eat about twenty onions a day, so that's…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我猜差不多有一个星期了。”斯坦利回答，“我们每人每天大概能吃二十来个洋葱，那样的话…”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He wondered if he was delirious.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他怀疑自己可能已经神志不清了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It occurred to him that he couldn't remember the last time he felt happiness. It wasn't just being sent to Camp Green Lake that had made his life miserable. Before that he'd been unhappy at school, where he had no friends, and bullies like Derrick Dunne picked on him. No one liked him, and the truth was, he didn't especially like himself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他忽然意识到自己已经不记得上一次碰到开心事是什么时候了。他的生活变得那么悲惨并不仅仅是因为被送到翠湖营。早在学校里，他就已经很不开心了。他没有朋友，德里克·邓恩那样的小霸王总是欺负他。没人喜欢他，就连他也不太喜欢自己。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Two hundred and eighty onions," said Zero.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“两百八十个洋葱。”零蛋说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Two nights later, Stanley lay awake staring up at the star-filled sky. He was too happy to fall asleep.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两天后的一个晚上，斯坦利躺在地上，望着星群密布的夜空。他太快乐了，根本无心入睡。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now he didn't smell a thing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在，他什么也闻不到了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He knew he had no reason to be happy. He had heard or read somewhere that right before a person freezes to death, he suddenly feels nice and warm. He wondered if perhaps he was experiencing something like that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他知道没有什么事情值得开心。他以前听说过，要不就是在哪里读到过，人即将被冻死前会忽然产生一种愉快而温暖的感觉。他怀疑自己或许正在经历这种事情。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你觉得我们已经吃了多少洋葱了？”他问零蛋。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Stanley considered placing it back in front of Zero's nose, but it wouldn't be the same.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯坦利想把花瓣重新放回到零蛋的鼻子前，可是原先的情景不再重现了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He remembered what Zero had said a few days before. If Zero had just kept those shoes, then neither of them would be here right now.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他想起几天前零蛋说的话。要是零蛋留着那双鞋，他俩就不会待在这里了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It seemed like Zero had lived at Camp Green Lake forever, but as Stanley thought about it now, he realized that Zero must have gotten there no more than a month or two before him. Zero was actually arrested a day later. But Stanley's trial kept getting delayed because of baseball.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯坦利原以为零蛋一直住在翠湖营，可是现在想来，零蛋比他早不了一两个月。实际上，零蛋比他晚一天被捕，只不过因为棒球赛，他的判决才被推迟了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He looked over at Zero sleeping near him. Zero's face was lit in the starlight, and there was a flower petal in front of his nose that moved back and forth as he breathed. It reminded Stanley of something out of a cartoon. Zero breathed in, and the petal was drawn up almost touching his nose. Zero breathed out, and the petal moved toward his chin. It stayed on Zero's face for an amazingly long time before fluttering off to the side.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他看了看身边的零蛋。星光照耀着零蛋的脸庞，他的鼻尖上有一片花瓣，随着他的呼吸来回起伏。这幅景象让他想起了动画片中的情景。零蛋每吸进一口气，那片花瓣便几乎贴到了他的鼻子上；每吐出一口气，花瓣又翻倒在他的下巴上。花瓣神奇地在零蛋的脸上逗留了好久，然后飘落在旁边。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As Stanley stared at the glittering night sky, he thought there was no place he would rather be. He was glad Zero put the shoes on the parked car. He was glad they fell from the overpass and hit him on the head.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯坦利盯着闪烁不定的星空，觉得自己已经没有地方可去了。他很庆幸零蛋把那双鞋放在了小轿车上。他也很庆幸那双鞋从天桥上掉下来，砸在他的脑袋上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He doubted any counselors were still on guard. Everyone had to think they were dead. Buzzard food.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他拿不准还有没有训导员守在那里。每个人肯定都认为他们已经死了，喂秃鹫了吧。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When the shoes first fell from the sky, he remembered thinking that destiny had struck him. Now, he thought so again. It was more than a coincidence. It had to be destiny.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="记得当那双鞋从天而降时，他以为是命运降临了。现在，他的想法还是一样。这绝非只是一次巧合。这一定是命运。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They could refill their jars and canteen at the camp. Maybe sneak into the kitchen and get some food.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到营地时，他们还能再将罐子和水壶灌满水。没准还能溜进厨房，找点吃的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It would mean living the rest of his life as a fugitive. The police would always be after him. At least he could call his parents and tell them he was still alive. But he couldn't go visit them, in case the police were watching the apartment. Although, if everyone thought he was dead, they wouldn't bother to watch the apartment. He would have to somehow get a new identity.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这就意味着他的余生就要在逃亡中度过。警察会一直追捕他。至少他可以给爸爸妈妈打电话，告诉他们自己还活着。但是，他无法去看望他们，生怕警察在监视公寓。但如果大家都以为他死了，就会懒得去监视公寓了。他得设法给自己搞一个新的身份。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Maybe they wouldn't have to return to Camp Green Lake, he thought. Maybe they could make it past the camp, then follow the dirt road back to civilization. They could fill the sack with onions, and the three jars with water. And he had his canteen as well.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="也许他们不用再回到翠湖营，也许他们可以绕开营地，顺着那条尘土飞扬的小路回到文明世界。他们可以装满满一袋洋葱，再带上三罐水。况且，他还有个水壶呢。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now, I'm really thinking crazy, he thought. He wondered if a crazy person wonders if he's crazy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在，我真的是疯了。他想。他不知道一个疯子会不会去思考自己是否发了疯。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">You're crazy! he told himself. Besides, just because he found a lipstick container with K B on it, that didn't mean there was treasure buried there.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="或许这就是命运。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But even as he thought this, an even crazier idea kept popping into his head. He knew it was too crazy to even consider. Still, if he was going to be a fugitive for the rest of his life, it would help to have some money, perhaps a treasure chest full of money.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尽管他觉得这个想法很疯狂，但他的脑袋里又冒出了一个更疯狂的想法。他知道这个想法太不着边际，根本想都不用去想。然而如果下半辈子只能逃亡的话，手头有点钱还是有用的，或许满满一箱子钱会更好。">查看中文翻译</div>
