<div class="line_en">"They think so much about me that they always play without me!" Howl bellowed. Sophie realized that he was only trying to sing Calcifer's saucepan song and lay down again, whereupon Howl fell over the chair and caught his foot in the stool so that it shot across the room. After that, he tried to go upstairs through the broom cupboard, and then the yard. This seemed to puzzle him a little. But finally he discovered the stairs, all except the bottom one, and fell up them on his face. The whole castle shook.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Who, me?" said Howl. "I assure you, my friends, that I am cone sold stober." He got up and stalked upstairs, feeling for the wall as if he thought it might escape him unless he kept in touch with it. His bedroom door did escape him. "What a lie that was!" Howl remarked as he walked into the wall. "My shining dishonesty will be the salvation of me." He walked into the wall several times more, in several different places, before he discovered his bedroom door and crashed his way through it. Sophie could hear him falling about, saying that his bed was dodging.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“谁？我吗？”哈尔说：“朋友，我可以跟你保证，我清醒地要命。”他站起来往楼上走，一路摸着墙，好像担心若不这样做的话，墙就会逃走，不过他卧室的门倒是真的逃走了。“我刚说的是彻头彻尾的谎言，”哈尔边说边撞到墙上：“我那令人眩目的不诚实将会是我的救命法宝。”他又撞了好几次墙，每次撞的地方都不相同。终于他找到卧室的门，碰碰撞撞地穿过门进了房间。苏菲可以听到他四处跌跤，抱怨说他的床在躲他。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Unfortunately, the noise Howl made woke Michael up, and Percival, who was sleeping on the floor in Michael's room. Michael came downstairs, saying that they were so thoroughly awake that they might as well go out and gather the flowers for the Midsummer garlands while the day was still cool. Sophie was not sorry to go out into the place of flowers for one last time. There was a warm, milky haze out there, filled with the scent and half-hidden colors. Sophie thumped along, testing the squashy ground with her stick and listening to the whirrings and twitters of the thousands of birds, feeling truly regretful. She stroked a moist satin lily and fingered one of the ragged purple flowers with long, powdery stamens. She looked back at the tall black castle breathing the mist behind them. She sighed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不幸的是，哈尔那一番吵闹把麦可也吵醒了，还有波西瓦，他睡在麦可房间的地上。麦可下楼来，说既然都醒了，不如趁着清晨天气尚凉，到外头去采仲夏日花环要用的花，苏菲不排斥到那花的世界去做最后一次巡礼。外头有温暖、乳白色的薄雾，充满香气及半隐藏的颜色。苏菲以拐杖探测柔软的土地，砰砰使劲走着，沿路聆听成千上百的林鸟吱吱喳喳唱个不停，她觉得好遗憾！她抚摸一朵潮湿的缎百合，并以手指抚弄一朵破损的、满是花粉的长花蕊紫色花朵。她回首看那挺立在雾中高高的黑色城堡，忍不住叹了口气。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You remember being here before?" Michael asked excitedly. He had by no means given up his idea that Percival might be Prince Justin.</div>

<div class="line_en">They fetched two bathloads of flowers. Sophie noticed that when they came in the second time, Michael spun the knob over the door several times. That must have something to do with keeping the Witch out. Then of course there were the Midsummer garlands to make. That took a longtime. Sophie had meant to leave Michael and Percival to do that, but Michael was too busy asking Percival cunning questions and Percival was very slow at the work. Sophie knew what made Michael excited. There was a sort of air about Percival, as if he expected something to happen soon. It made Sophie wonder just how much in the power of the Witch he still was. She had to make most of the garlands. Any thoughts she might have had about staying and helping Howl against the Witch vanished. Howl, who could have made all the garlands just by waving his hand, was now snoring so loudly she could hear him right through the shop.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们共摘了足以装满两大浴缸的话。苏菲注意到，当他们第二次进屋时，麦可将门把转了好几次，这一定是跟将女巫挡在门外有关吧！接着当然就是制造仲夏节花环了，那花了好久的时间。苏菲本来是想让麦可和波西瓦两人去负责的，但是麦可尽忙着问波西瓦一些精明、巧妙的问题，而波西瓦行动非常迟缓，苏菲知道为何麦可会那么兴奋，波西瓦身上带有一股特别的气氛，好像他期待着很快将会发生某事一样。这令苏菲想到，他到底还受女巫掌控多少？结果她必须独立完成大部分的花环。所有她曾有过、关于留下来帮助哈尔抵抗女巫的想法，全都烟消云散了。因为那个只消一挥手，就能制造所有这些花环的人正鼾声雷动，她在店里都听得一清二楚。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"In a moment," Sophie said, crossing room with her bundle behind her back. She did not want Calcifer raising an outcry about that contract. She stretched out her hand to unhook her stick from the chair, and somebody knocked at the door. Sophie stuck, with her hand stretched out, looked inquiringly at Calcifer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“等一会儿。”苏菲说，将包裹藏在身后走过房间。她不想引起卡西法对那个契约的事强烈抗议。她伸手去接那挂在椅子上的拐杖，突然有人敲门。苏菲愣住了，手仍伸着，她转头询问地看着卡西法。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They were so long making the garlands that it was time to open the shop before they had finished. Michael fetched them bread and honey, and they ate while they dealt with the tremendous first rush of customers. Although Midsummer Day, in the way of holidays, had turned out to be a gray and chilly day in Market Chipping, half the town came, dressed in fine holiday clothes, to buy flowers and garlands for the festival. There was the usual jostling crowd out in the street. So many people came into the shop that it was getting on midday before Sophie finally stole away up the stairs and through the broom cupboard. They had taken so much money, Sophie thought as she stole about, packing up some food and her old clothes in a bundle, that Michael's hoard under the hearthstone would be ten times the size.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们花许多时间作花环，结果花环还没做完就已经到开店时间了。麦可携来面包和蜂蜜，他们一边应付第一批涌入的人潮一边吃早餐。虽然像许多节庆日一样，今年马克奇平仲夏日的天气既灰暗又阴冷，但镇上一半的人都来了，穿着美丽的节庆日衣裳，买节庆要用的花及花环。街上人潮如一般节日时一样热闹拥挤，客人川流不息。苏菲一直到近中午时，才终于能够偷偷走上阶梯，通过储物柜。她蹑手蹑脚地打包——拿了一些食物，连同她的旧衣服一起包起来，心里边想着，他们已偷存了好多钱，现在麦可存在壁炉石下的储蓄，怕不有十倍之多了。">查看中文翻译</div>

Sophie did not care to think how Howl might react if Fanny woke him by stabbing him with her parasol. "No, no!" she said. "Howl has been very kind to me." And this was true, Sophie realized.

<div class="line_en">Lettie was very fond of Percival. While Michael carried the hamper to the bench and unpacked cold chickens and wines and honey puddings from it, Lettie hung on to Percival's arm in an ownerlike way that Sophie could not quite approve of, and made him tell her all he remembered. Percival did not seem to mind. Lettie looked so lovely that Sophie did not blame him.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh, yes," Lettie said offhandedly. "Mind you, he was in disguise in a green uniform, but it was obviously him. He was so smooth and courtly, even when he was annoyed about the finding spells. I had to make him up two lots because they would keep showing that Wizard Suliman was somewhere between us and Market Chipping, and he swore that couldn't be true. And all the time I was doing them, he kept interrupting me, calling me 'sweet lady' in a sarcastic sort of way, and asking me who I was and where my family lived and how old I was. I thought it was cheek! I'd rather have Wizard Howl, and that's saying something!"</div>

Only then would Fanny believe that her carriage had not been mysteriously spirited away. Sophie was trying to explain, without really knowing herself, how one door could open on several different places, when Calcifer surged up from his logs, roaring.

She did not look as if she wanted to go, but she seemed to have no choice. Behind her, Howl's nephew, Neil, was shuffling toward the Witch even more slowly, glowering in his most ferocious way.

There was now a strong suggestion of a rather craggy face on the turnip. The trouble was, it was on the back side of the scarecrow. The scarecrow gave a wooden scramble, hopped upright uncertainly, and then swiftly spun its body round so that the front of it was under the craggy turnip face.

<div class="line_en">The scarecrow swung about uncertainly. "More than this," it said. "There are still part missing." Everyone waited, most of them too shaken to speak, while the scarecrow rotated this way and that, seemingly thinking.</div>

<div class="line_en">"This is one of the parts I was sent to find," it said in its mushy voice. It swung on its stick until it was facing Sophie. "I must thank you," it said. "My skull was far away and I ran out of strength before I reached it. I would have lain in that hedge forever if you had not come and talked life into me." It swiveled to Mrs. Fairfax and then to Lettie. "I thank you both too," it said.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Let it collect itself," said Calcifer. "No one's asked it to explain itself bef --" He suddenly stopped speaking and shrank until barely a green flame showed. Michael and Sophie exchanged alarmed glances.</div>

"Michael Fisher," it said, "tell your master, Howl, that he fell for my decoy. I now have woman called Lily Angorian in my fortress in the Waste. Tell him I will only let her go if he himself comes to fetch her. Is that clear, Michael Fisher?"</div>
