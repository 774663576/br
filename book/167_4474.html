<div class="line_en">"No. I want him taken on to the castle." Removing the boy from the city was one of his sister's better notions, Tyrion had decided. At Rosby, Tommen would be safe from the mob, and keeping him apart from his brother also made things more difficult for Stannis; even if he took King's Landing and executed Joffrey, he'd still have a Lannister claimant to contend with. "Lord Gyles is too sickly to run and too craven to fight. He'll command his castellan to open the gates. Once inside the walls, Bywater is to expel the garrison and hold Tommen there safe. Ask him how he likes the sound of Lord Bywater."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不对。我要他继续前往罗斯比城。”让这孩子离开君临是姐姐为数不多的好主意之一，提利昂决定将计就计。在罗斯比，托曼不会受暴民的威胁，而让他和他哥哥分开将使史坦尼斯面临棘手的情形：即使攻破君临，处死乔佛里，兰尼斯特家族依然有王位继承人。“盖尔斯伯爵要跑太病弱，要战又太怯懦，一旦被挟持，定会乖乖听命，指示他的代理城主打开城门。进城之后，拜瓦特应立即驱散守卫，确保托曼的安全。替我问问他，拜瓦特伯爵这头衔听起来如何？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Tyrion rode on toward Chataya's, but suddenly his patience deserted him. He twisted in the saddle, scanning the street behind. There were no signs of followers. Every window was dark or tightly shuttered. He heard nothing but the wind swirling down the alleys. If Cersei has someone stalking me tonight, he must be disguised as a rat. "Bugger it all," he muttered. He was sick of caution. Wheeling his horse around, he dug in his spurs. If anyone's after me, we'll see how well they ride. He flew through the moonlight streets, clattering over cobbles, darting down narrow alleys and up twisty wynds, racing to his love.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="提利昂本当朝莎塔雅的妓院继续骑行，但耐心却突然弃他而去。他勒马回身，扫视背后的街道。没有跟踪的迹象。窗户要么黑乎乎，要么就是紧紧关闭。除了巷弄里呼啸的风声，什么也听不到。若是今晚瑟曦让人跟踪我，他非扮成老鼠不可。“去他的吧，”他喃喃道。他已经厌倦了提心吊胆的日子，便调过马头，使劲一踢，飞奔而去。如果有人跟踪，就让我们来比试比试骑术。在明亮的月光下，马蹄“得得”地踏过鹅卵石地面，他快马奔出窄巷小弄，向着爱人奔去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They left through a postern gate in the north wall. Tyrion put his heels into his horse and clattered down Shadowblack Lane. A few furtive shapes darted into alleys at the sound of hoofbeats on the cobbles, but no one dared accost them. The council had extended his curfew; it was death to be taken on the streets after the evenfall bells had sung. The measure had restored a degree of peace to King's Landing and quartered the number of corpses found in the alleys of a morning, yet Varys said the people cursed him for it. They should be thankful they have the breath to curse. A pair of gold cloaks confronted them as they were making their way along Coppersmith's Wynd, but when they realized whom they'd challenged they begged the Hand's pardons and waved them on. Bronn turned south for the Mud Gate and they parted company.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们从北墙的边门离开。提利昂驱策坐骑，沿着夜影巷“得得”而行。听到鹅卵石上的马蹄声，几个鬼鬼崇崇的影子慌忙窜进角落，无人敢上前搭讪。御前会议业已延长宵禁时间，暮钟敲响之后，谁还留在街上，就是死罪难逃。这一措施一定程度上恢复了君临的秩序，每天清晨在街市发现的尸体减少到原来的四分之一，然而瓦里斯报告说人们因此而咒骂他。他们应该感激我，是我让他们留着咒骂的力气。经过铜匠巷时，他们遇到两个金袍卫士，当卫士意识到他们的身份后，赶紧为自己的无礼行为向首相致歉，并挥手示意他们继续上路。他们在此分道扬镳，波隆转向南，前往烂泥门。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="捶门时，他听见微弱的乐声从插有尖刺的石墙内飘出。那对伊班人之一引他入内。提利昂将马交给他，问：“是谁？”大厅的菱形窗格闪烁着黄色的光，他听到男人的歌声。">查看中文翻译</div>

I loved a maid as white as winter, with moonglow in her hair. Behind her stood one of the begging brothers, a portly man in filthy patched robes, his bare feet crusty with dirt, a bowl hung about his neck on a leather thong where a septon would have worn a crystal.

I feared the man meant to use me as I had heard men used small boys, but in truth the only part of me he had need of was my manhood. He gave me a potion that made me powerless to move or speak, yet did nothing to dull my senses. With a long hooked blade, he sliced me root and stem, chanting all the while. I watched him burn my manly parts on a brazier. The flames turned blue, and I heard a voice answer his call, though I did not understand the words they spoke.</div>

The voice from the flames. Was it a god, a demon, some conjurer's trick? I could not tell you, and I know all the tricks. All I can say for a certainty is that he called it, and it answered, and since that day I have hated magic and all those who practice it. If Lord Stannis is one such, I mean to see him dead."</div>

<div class="line_en">"The mummers had sailed by the time he was done with me. Once I had served his purpose, the man had no further interest in me, so he put me out. When I asked him what I should do now, he answered that he supposed I should die. To spite him, I resolved to live. I begged, I stole, and I sold what parts of my body still remained to me. Soon I was as good a thief as any in Myr, and when I was older I learned that often the contents of a man's letters are more valuable than the contents of his purse.</div>
