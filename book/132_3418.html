<div class="line_en">I visited St. Louis lately, and on my way West, after changing cars at Terre Haute, Indiana, a mild, benevolent-looking gentleman of about forty-five, or maybe fifty, came in at one of the way-stations and sat down beside me. We talked together pleasantly on various subjects for an hour, perhaps, and I found him exceedingly intelligent and entertaining. When he learned that I was from Washington, he immediately began to ask questions about various public men, and about Congressional affairs; and I saw very shortly that I was conversing with a man who was perfectly familiar with the ins and outs of political life at the Capital, even to the ways and manners, and customs of procedure of Senators and Representatives in the Chambers of the national Legislature. Presently two men halted near us for a single moment, and one said to the other:</div>

<div class="line_en">"On the 19th of December, 1853, I started from St. Louis on the evening train bound for Chicago. There were only twenty-four passengers, all told. There were no ladies and no children. We were in excellent spirits, and pleasant acquaintanceships were soon formed. The journey bade fair to be a happy one; and no individual in the party, I think, had even the vaguest presentiment of the horrors we were soon to undergo.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那是1853年12月19日，我从圣路易乘夜班火车去芝加哥。车上总共只有24名乘客。没有妇女，也没有小孩。我们的兴致很好，大家很快就混熟了。看来，这是一次快乐舒心的旅行；我猜这一伙人中压根儿就没有一位预感到很快就要经历的那种恐怖局面。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"At 11 P. m. it began to snow hard. Shortly after leaving the small village of Welden, we entered upon that tremendous prairie solitude that stretches its leagues on leagues of houseless dreariness far away toward the jubilee Settlements. The winds, unobstructed by trees or hills, or even vagrant rocks, whistled fiercely across the level desert, driving the falling snow before it like spray from the crested waves of a stormy sea. The snow was deepening fast; and we knew, by the diminished speed of the train, that the engine was plowing through it with steadily increasing difficulty. Indeed, it almost came to a dead halt sometimes, in the midst of great drifts that piled themselves like colossal graves across the track. Conversation began to flag. Cheerfulness gave place to grave concern. The possibility of being imprisoned in the snow, on the bleak prairie, fifty miles from any house, presented itself to every mind, and extended its depressing influence over every spirit.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="晚上十一点钟，天下起大雪来。火车刚一离开那个名叫韦尔登的小村，就进入空旷寂寥的大草原。千里荒原，渺无人烟，一直延展到朱必利定居点。狂风呼啸着刮过平展展的荒地。那儿没有树木，没有山丘，甚至连七零八落的岩石也见不到，所以风刮起来毫无阻挡。随风飞扬的雪花，就像狂风暴雨在海浪尖上激起的浪花。雪越积越深，车速减慢。我们知道，这是火车头在积雪中开路越来越费劲了。说实在的，有时候它简直就停止不动了。大风在轨道上堆积起一个个大雪堆，活像一座座坟山。聊天也没有劲儿了。欢乐让位给焦虑。要是被大雪困住，待在荒凉的大草原上，方圆50英里可都没有人家——这种想法浮现在每个人的心头，把大家都弄得精神非常颓丧。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"One short hour sufficed to prove the utter uselessness of our efforts. The storm barricaded the track with a dozen drifts while we dug one away. And worse than this, it was discovered that the last grand charge the engine had made upon the enemy had broken the fore-and-aft shaft of the driving-wheel! With a free track before us we should still have been helpless. We entered the car wearied with labor, and very sorrowful. We gathered about the stoves, and gravely canvassed our situation. We had no provisions whatever -- in this lay our chief distress. We could not freeze, for there was a good supply of wood in the tender. This was our only comfort. The discussion ended at last in accepting the disheartening decision of the conductor, viz., that it would be death for any man to attempt to travel fifty miles on foot through snow like that. We could not send for help, and even if we could it would not come. We must submit, and await, as patiently as we might, succor or starvation! I think the stoutest heart there felt a momentary chill when those words were uttered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="短短的一个小时就足以证明我们在白费力气。暴风雪积成了十几个雪堆，把路轨阻塞了，而我们仅仅刨掉了一个。更加糟糕的是，人们发现，刚才火车头对敌人发起冲锋时已经把主动轮的纵向轴弄断了！即使铁路畅通无阻，我们也无可奈何了。我们干活儿干得精疲力竭，心里又不是滋味，便进了车厢。大家围着火炉严肃地讨论眼下的处境。我们什么吃的都没有——大伙儿最窝心的就是这一点。我们是不会冻死的，因为煤水车里有的是木头，这是我们惟一的安慰。讨论到最后，大家都接受了列车员令人丧气的结论，就是说，谁想徒步在这样的雪地里走50英里路，那就等于去寻死。我们无法派人去求援，即便我们有办法去，也没人愿意来援助。我们只好听天由命，耐心等待，要么有人来救援，要么就等着饿死！我想，就是最刚强的人一听了这话，心也会马上变凉的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"At two o'clock in the morning I was aroused out of an uneasy slumber by the ceasing of all motion about me. The appalling truth flashed upon me instantly -- we were captives in a snow-drift! 'All hands to the rescue!' Every man sprang to obey. Out into the wild night, the pitchy darkness, the billowy snow, the driving storm, every soul leaped, with the consciousness that a moment lost now might bring destruction to us all. Shovels, hands, boards -- anything, everything that could displace snow, was brought into instant requisition. It was a weird picture, that small company of frantic men fighting the banking snows, half in the blackest shadow and half in the angry light of the locomotive's reflector.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凌晨两点，四周的一切活动都停止了。我从不得安宁的睡眠中惊醒。可怕的实情顿时闪过我的心头——我们成了雪堆里的囚徒！“全体起来动手自救！”大家一跃而起去执行这道命令。夜茫茫漆黑一片。铺天盖地的大雪，势不可挡的风暴，大家从车厢跳进这样一个世界，心里都明白，现在要争分夺秒，要不就会有灭顶之灾。铲子、手、木板——凡是能清除积雪的东西立刻都用上了。那真是一副离奇的景象：一小撮发狂似的人跟越堆越高的积雪拼搏。雪堆下半截隐没在黑黢黢的阴影里，上半截暴露在车头反光灯炽烈的灯光下。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="过了一会儿，谈话变成了一种三三两两的窃窃私语，话题仍离不开火车，这种低语随着阵阵狂风的起落而忽高忽低；灯光昏暗起来；大多数遭难者在忽明忽暗的黑影中安下心来想——忘掉眼前，如果可能的话，——睡觉，如果可以的话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The eternal night -- it surely seemed eternal to us -- wore its lagging hours away at last, and the cold gray dawn broke in the east. As the light grew stronger the passengers began to stir and give signs of life, one after another, and each in turn pushed his slouched hat up from his forehead, stretched his stiffened limbs, and glanced out of the windows upon the cheerless prospect. It was cheer less, indeed! -- not a living thing visible anywhere, not a human habitation; nothing but a vast white desert; uplifted sheets of snow drifting hither and thither before the wind -- a world of eddying flakes shutting out the firmament above.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="漫漫无期的长夜——我们觉得的确是漫漫无期的——终于把磨磨蹭蹭的时光打发走了，东方破晓，现出灰冷的晨光，亮光逐渐增强，旅客一个接一个活动起来了，显示出生命的种种迹象；一个接一个地把耷拉下来的帽子从额头上掀起来，舒展舒展僵硬的四肢，然后从窗户里向外窥视那副萧瑟的景象。的确萧瑟透顶了！——个生物的影子都没有，一个人家也没有；什么都没有，只有一片白茫茫的荒野，卷起的雪片随风到处飘扬——一个雪片飞舞的世界遮没了上面的天宇。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"The amendment was put to vote, after a fiery debate, and lost. Mr. Harris was substituted on the first amendment. The balloting then began. Five ballots were held without a choice. On the sixth, Mr. Harris was elected, all voting for him but himself. It was then moved that his election should be ratified by acclamation, which was lost, in consequence of his again voting against himself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="经过一番激烈的争论，最后这一修正案被付诸表决，没有通过。第一修正案提出的替换人是哈里斯先生。然后开始投票表决，五次投票都没有结果。第六次投票中，哈里斯先生当选，除了他一人外，全体投了赞成票。于是有人提出动议，应当鼓掌通过他的当选，这一动议由于他再次投票反对自己当选而遭到否决。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The preparations for supper diverted the attention of the Ferguson faction from the discussion of their grievance for a long time, and then, when they would have taken it up again, the happy announcement that Mr. Harris was ready drove all thought of it to the winds.</div>

<div class="line_en">"On the first ballot -- there was a tie, half the members favoring one candidate on account of his youth, and half favoring the other on account of his superior size. The President gave the casting vote for the latter, Mr. Messick. This decision created considerable dissatisfaction among the friends of Mr. Ferguson, the defeated candidate, and there was some talk of demanding a new ballot; but in the midst of it a motion to adjourn was carried, and the meeting broke up at once.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第一次投票出现了僵持局面，半数人赞成某一候选人，因为他年轻；半数人同意另一个，因为他个头大。主席投了决定性的一票，赞成后者，即梅西克先生。这一结果在落选人弗格森的朋友们当中激起了相当大的不满情绪，有人在议论，要求重新进行一次投票表决，然而在此期间休会的动议被通过了，于是立即散会。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"We improvised tables by propping up the backs of car-seats, and sat down with hearts full of gratitude to the finest supper that had blessed our vision for seven torturing days. How changed we were from what we had been a few short hours before! Hopeless, sad-eyed misery, hunger, feverish anxiety, desperation, then; thankfulness, serenity, joy too deep for utterance now. That I know was the cheeriest hour of my eventful life. The winds howled, and blew the snow wildly about our prison house, but they were powerless to distress us any more. I liked Harris. He might have been better done, perhaps, but I am free to say that no man ever agreed with me better than Harris, or afforded me so large a degree of satisfaction. Messick was very well, though rather high-flavored, but for genuine nutritiousness and delicacy of fiber, give me Harris. Messick had his good points -- I will not attempt to deny it, nor do I wish to do it but he was no more fitted for breakfast than a mummy would be, sir -- not a bit. Lean? -- why, bless me! -- and tough? Ah, he was very tough! You could not imagine it -- you could never imagine anything like it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们支起车厢座位的靠背临时凑成了餐桌，满怀感激之情坐了下来，在那七天的磨难中索回在我们的美梦中的最精美的晚餐现在就摆在眼前。我们跟几小时之前真是不可同日而语！当时：万念俱灰，愁眉苦脸，饥肠辘辘，忧心如焚，走投无路；现在：感恩戴德，泰然自若，大喜过望。我知道这是我坎坷的一生中最快乐的时光。风在吼叫，刮得大雪在我们的牢房周围狂飞乱舞，可是风雪再也无力困扰我们了。我喜欢哈里斯。他也许还可以煮得更好一些，但我可以毫无顾忌地说，谁也没有哈里斯那样对我的胃口，使我那样称心如意。梅西克挺不错，不过就是有点儿变味，不过要讲真正的营养、肉的细嫩，我倒是要哈里斯。梅西克自有他的长处——我不想否认这一点，也不愿否认——可是要他当早饭，比一具木乃伊好不了多少，先生——简直一模一样。瘦吗？——哎，上帝保佑！——粗吗？啊，他是粗得够呛！你是无法想像的——你永远也想像不出这一类事。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Do not interrupt me, please. After breakfast we elected a man by the name of Walker, from Detroit, for supper. He was very good. I wrote his wife so afterward. He was worthy of all praise. I shall always remember Walker. He was a little rare, but very good. And then the next morning we had Morgan of Alabama for breakfast. He was one of the finest men I ever sat down to handsome, educated, refined, spoke several languages fluently a perfect gentleman he was a perfect gentleman, and singularly juicy. For supper we had that Oregon patriarch, and he was a fraud, there is no question about it -- old, scraggy, tough, nobody can picture the reality. I finally said, gentlemen, you can do as you like, but I will wait for another election. And Grimes of Illinois said, 'Gentlemen, I will wait also. When you elect a man that has something to recommend him, I shall be glad to join you again.' It soon became evident that there was general dissatisfaction with Davis of Oregon, and so, to preserve the good will that had prevailed so pleasantly since we had had Harris, an election was called, and the result of it was that Baker of Georgia was chosen. He was splendid! Well, well -- after that we had Doolittle, and Hawkins, and McElroy (there was some complaint about McElroy, because he was uncommonly short and thin), and Penrod, and two Smiths, and Bailey (Bailey had a wooden leg, which was clear loss, but he was otherwise good), and an Indian boy, and an organ -- grinder, and a gentleman by the name of Buckminster -- a poor stick of a vagabond that wasn't any good for company and no account for breakfast. We were glad we got him elected before relief came."</div>

He got so frost -- bitten and frozen up generally, and used up for want of something to eat, that he was sick and out of his head two or three months afterward. He is all right now, only he is a monomaniac, and when he gets on that old subject he never stops till he has eat up that whole car -- load of people he talks about. He would have finished the crowd by this time, only he had to get out here. He has got their names as pat as A B C. When he gets them all eat up but himself, he always says: 'Then the hour for the usual election for breakfast having arrived; and there being no opposition, I was duly elected, after which, there being no objections offered, I resigned.
