<div class="line_en">She murmured sleepily as Theon slid out from under her arm and got to his feet. A few embers still smoldered in the hearth. Wex slept on the floor at the foot of the bed, rolled up inside his cloak and dead to the world. Nothing moved. Theon crossed to the window and threw open the shutters. Night touched him with cold fingers, and gooseprickles rose on his bare skin. He leaned against the stone sill and looked out on dark towers, empty yards, black sky, and more stars than a man could ever count if he lived to be a hundred. A half-moon floated above the Bell Tower and cast its reflection on the roof of the glass gardens. He heard no alarms, no voices, not so much as a footfall.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="席恩滑开她手臂的搂抱，下床之时，凯拉发出几声睡意惺忪的呢喃。壁炉里几点余烬在燃烧。威克斯睡在床脚地板上，裹着自己的斗篷，一动也不动。一片寂静。席恩走到窗边，把高处的窄窗一扇扇打开。夜晚伸出冰凉的手指，使他不禁浑身起了鸡皮疙瘩。他倾身靠近石窗台，望向外面黑暗的塔楼，空旷的广场，乌黑的天空和那数到一百岁也算不清的无垠繁星。半个月亮从钟楼后面爬上来，玻璃花园的顶棚反射它的光芒。没有警报，没有话语，就连一两声脚步都听不到。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Wind sighed faintly against the shutters. Somewhere, far off, he heard the yowl of a cat in heat. Nothing else. Sleep, Greyjoy, he told himself. The castle is quiet, and you have guards posted. At your door, at the gates, on the armory.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="晚风在窄窗上微声叹气。从远处，某个角落，他听到猫咪激动的叫声。除此之外，什么也没有。睡吧，葛雷乔伊，他告诉自己。城堡如此宁静，你还派出了守卫不是？在卧室门外，在城门边，在军械库都有人值班呢。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He might have put it down to a bad dream, but he did not remember dreaming. Kyra had worn him out. Until Theon had sent for her, she had lived all of her eighteen years in the winter town without ever setting foot inside the walls of the castle. She came to him wet and eager and lithe as a weasel, and there had been a certain undeniable spice to fucking a common tavern wench in Lord Eddard Stark's own bed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="也许是刚做了什么噩梦，然而现在却想不起来。凯拉让他精疲力尽。被席恩招来之前，她是个从未踏进城堡半步的十八岁少女，一辈子都在避冬市镇仰望临冬城的高耸墙垒。她又湿又软又饥渴，活像头黄鼠狼。不可否认的是，在艾德·史塔克公爵的卧床上操粗鄙的酒馆妓女实在别有一番情趣。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">All's well, Greyjoy. Hear the quiet? You ought to be drunk with joy. You took Winterfell with fewer than thirty men, a feat to sing of. Theon started back to bed. He'd roll Kyra on her back and fuck her again, that ought to banish these phantoms. Her gasps and giggles would make a welcome respite from this silence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一切正常，葛雷乔伊。你难道觉察不出四周的宁静？还是及时行乐吧。用不到三十个人，你拿下了临冬城堡，这将是被永远歌颂的丰功伟绩。于是席恩返回床边，决定把凯拉翻过来，再干一次，以此驱散那些无谓的幻影。她的喘息和娇笑是对这片寂静最好的回应。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Urzen stood outside his door, a sinewy man with a round shield slung over his back. "The wolves are quiet," Theon told him. "Go see what they're doing, and come straight back." The thought of the direwolves running loose gave him a queasy feeling. He remembered the day in the wolfswood when the wildlings had attacked Bran. Summer and Grey Wind had torn them to pieces.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Go back to sleep, this does not concern you." Theon poured himself a cup of wine and drank it down. All the time he was listening, hoping to hear a howl. Too few men, he thought sourly. I have too few men. If Asha does not come…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“继续睡吧，不关你的事。”席恩给自己满上一杯葡萄酒，灌下去。他一直在倾听，满心希望能听见一声狼嗥。人手太少了，他酸酸地想，我只有这几个手下，如果阿莎还不来…">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Wex returned the quickest, shaking his head side to side. Cursing, Theon found his tunic and breeches on the floor where he had dropped them in his haste to get at Kyra. Over the tunic he donned a jerkin of iron-studded leather, and he belted a longsword and dagger at his waist. His hair was wild as the wood, but he had larger concerns.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="威克斯飞快返回，头摇得像拨浪鼓。席恩破口咒骂，拣起之前因急着上凯拉而扔了一地的衣服裤子。他在外衣外罩上一件镶铁钉的皮背心，并把长剑和匕首拴在腰际。头发乱得像草丛，但和令他恐惧的大麻烦相比，这反而无关紧要。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He wondered if Stygg had reached Deepwood Motte yet. The man was not as skilled a rider as he claimed -- none of the ironmen were much good in the saddle -- but there'd been time enough. Asha might well be on her way. And if she leams that I have lost the Starks… It did not bear thinking about.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他不知斯提吉此刻抵达深林堡没有。此人虽不像他自称的那样精于骑术——铁民之中无人擅长鞍马之道——但算时间也够了。阿莎应该在路上。假如她知道我丢了两个史塔克…其后果简直不堪设想。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Theon told himself he must be as cold and deliberate as Lord Eddard. "Rouse the castle," he said. "Herd them out into the yard, everyone, we'll see who's missing. And have Lorren make a round of the gates. Wex, with me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="像艾德公爵一样冷静沉着，席恩提醒自己。“把城堡里的人都叫起来，”他说，“赶进院子，所有人都不准缺席，我们立刻检查。告诉罗伦，盘查各处城门。威克斯，跟我来。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Bran's bedchamber was empty, as was Rickon's half a turn below. Theon cursed himself. He should have kept a guard on them, but he'd deemed it more important to have men walking the walls and protecting the gates than to nursemaid a couple of children, one a cripple.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布兰的卧室空无一人，下方瑞肯的卧室亦房门大开。席恩不禁咒骂自己。早该派人看住他们，我却鬼迷心窍．认为巡逻城墙和保护城门比看守两个小孩——其中一个还是残废——重要得多。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Outside he heard sobbing as the castle folk were pulled from their beds and driven into the yard. I'll give them reason to sob. I've used them gently, and this is how they repay me. He'd even had two of his own men whipped bloody for raping that kennel girl, to show them he meant to be just. They still blame me for the rape, though. And the rest. He deemed that unfair. Mikken had killed himself with his mouth, just as Benfred had. As for Chayle, he had to give someone to the Drowned God, his men expected it. "I bear you no ill will," he'd told the septon before they threw him down the well, "but you and your gods have no place here now." You'd think the others might be grateful he hadn't chosen one of them, but no. He wondered how many of them were part of this plot against him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="外面传来呜咽声，城堡的居民们正被硬生生从床上拖起，驱赶到广场。我会让他们哭个痛快！我待他们多么亲切，他们回报我的却是如此。他两个手下为着侵犯兽舍小妹的缘故，被他鞭打得血肉横飞，这不足以展示他的公正无私么？然而，他们却把这次强暴，还有旁的所有事，统统归咎于他，真是太不公平！密肯是自己多嘴多舌才送命的，就和本福德一样。至于柴尔，他总得奉献点什么给淹神啊，他的人都看着呢。“我对你并无恶意，”他们把修士扔进中庭的水井之前，他开口道，“只是你和你的神已不能在此容身。”本以为其他人会心存感激，为着他不肯波及他们的缘故，然而事实却大相径庭。真不知有多少人参与了这次的脱逃密谋。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Hunter's Gate was conveniently sited close to the kennels and kitchens.

Theon demanded.</div>

Drennan lay half naked in the gatehouse, in the snug room where the drawbridge was worked. His throat had been opened ear to ear. A ragged tunic concealed the half-healed scars on his back, but his boots were scattered amidst the rushes, and his breeches tangled about his feet. There was cheese on a small table near the door, beside an empty flagon. And two cups.</div>

<div class="line_en">The other fool was in a deal worse shape than Drennan. When Black Lorren drew him out of the water, they saw that one of his arms had been wrenched off at the elbow, half of his neck was missing, and there was a ragged hole where his navel and groin once had been. The pike tore through his bowels as Lorren was pulling him in. The stench was awful.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="另一个白痴的情形比邓兰糟糕得多。黑罗伦将他拖出河面，大家当下发现此人一只手臂从肘部齐齐扭断，半边颈项不见踪影，原本是肚脐和私处的地方只剩一个黑窟窿。罗伦叉他上岸，长枪贯穿肚肠，臭气熏天。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Theon flung the cup into the hearth. "I'd say Drennan was pulling down his breeches to stick it in the woman when she stuck it in him. His own cheese knife, by the look of it. Someone find a pike and fish the other fool out of the moat."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="席恩扬手将杯子掷进壁炉。“邓兰这白痴一定是拉下马裤想插女人的时候，反被那女人给插了。依这里的状况看，凶器是切奶酪的刀。来人，找杆枪，把另一个白痴给我从河里钓出来。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The direwolves," Theon said. "Both of them, at a guess." Disgusted, he walked back to the drawbridge. Winterfell was encircled by two massive granite walls, with a wide moat between them. The outer wall stood eighty feet high, the inner more than a hundred. Lacking men, Theon had been forced to abandon the outer defenses and post his guards along the higher inner walls. He dared not risk having them on the wrong side of the moat should the castle rise against him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“冰原狼的杰作，”席恩道，“两匹一起上，应该是。”他满心作呕，便走回吊桥。临冬城有两道花岗岩厚墙，一条宽阔的护城河横亘其间。外墙八十尺高，内墙高度超过百尺。由于人手不足，席恩只好放弃外层防线，仅把守卫安置在更高的内墙上。在城堡随时可能变乱的情况下，他可不敢冒险，把有限的兵力放在护城河的另一边。">查看中文翻译</div>

Then you hear a noise and move toward the gate, and suddenly you see eyes at the top of the stair, glowing green and gold in the torchlight. Two shadows come rushing toward you faster than you can believe. You catch a glimpse of teeth, start to level your spear, and they slam into you and open your belly, tearing through leather as if it were cheesecloth." He gave Urzen a hard shove. "And now you're down on your back, your guts are spilling out, and one of them has his teeth around your neck." Theon grabbed the man's scrawny throat, tightened his fingers, and smiled. "Tell me, at what moment during all of this do you stop to blow your fucking horn?" He shoved Urzen away roughly, sending him stumbling back against a merlon. The man rubbed his throat.

<div class="line_en">They're afoot, then. That was the best news he'd heard since he woke. Bran would be riding in his basket on Hodor's back, no doubt. Osha would need to carry Rickon; his little legs wouldn't take him far on their own. Theon was confident that he'd soon have them back in his hands. "Bran and Rickon have fled," he told the castle folk, watching their eyes. "Who knows where they've gone?" No one answered. "They could not have escaped without help," Theon went on. "Without food, clothing, weapons." He had locked away every sword and axe in Winterfell, but no doubt some had been hidden from him. "I'll have the names of all those who aided them. All those who turned a blind eye." The only sound was the wind. "Come first light, I mean to bring them back." He hooked his thumbs through his swordbelt. "I need huntsmen. Who wants a nice warm wolfskin to see them through the winter? Gage?" The cook had always greeted him cheerfully when he returned from the hunt, to ask whether he'd brought anything choice for the table, but he had nothing to say now. Theon walked back the way he had come, searching their faces for the least sign of guilty knowledge. "The wild is no place for a cripple. And Rickon, young as he is, how long will he last out there? Nan, think how frightened he must be." The old woman had nattered at him for ten years, telling her endless stories, but now she gaped at him as if he were some stranger. "I might have killed every man of you and given your women to my soldiers for their pleasure, but instead I protected you. Is this the thanks you offer?" Joseth who'd groomed his horses, Farlen who'd taught him all he knew of hounds, Barth the brewer's wife who'd been his flrst -- not one of them would meet his eyes. They hate me, he realized.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那么，他们是徒步前进。这是他醒来之后最好的消息。无疑，布兰被装在阿多背上的篮子里；欧莎得去背瑞肯——仅靠他幼小的腿脚可走不了多远。这下席恩确信他们还在掌中。“布兰和瑞肯逃跑了，”他对城里的人大声宣布，扫视他们的眼睛。“有谁知道他们去了哪儿？”无人应答。“他们不可能独立逃走，”席恩续道，“没食物，没衣服，没武器，他们是逃不了的。”他早已搜光临冬城里的每一把剑、每一只斧，但肯定有人藏匿武器。“我会查出谁帮助过他们。我也会查出睁只眼闭只眼的人。”只有风声。“当晨光初露，我就出发把他们抓回来。”他的拇指勾住剑柄。“我需要猎手。谁想要块上好的狼皮过冬？盖奇？”每次他打猎归来，大厨总是兴高采烈欢迎他，瞧瞧他有没有带什么野味猎获，然而现在却一言不发。席恩回头继续踱步，一边想从人们脸庞巡视出一点蛛丝马迹。“荒山野岭那不是跛子待的地方。想想瑞肯，半大小孩，怎么能撑下去？奶妈，你说他现在该有多害怕。”老妇人在他耳边唠唠叨叨了十年，给他讲过无数的故事，但而今她只朝他打呵欠，似乎根本不认得他。“我本可以把你们这些男人全杀光，然后把你们女人送给我的士兵享用，但我没有，我反而极力保护你们。你们就这样来感谢我么？”从前教他骑马的乔赛斯，教他驯狗的法兰，成为他第一次的芭丝——酿酒师傅的老婆…人人都避开他的目光。他们恨我，他终于意识到。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They assembled by the Hunter's Gate as the first pale rays of the sun brushed the top of the Bell Tower, their breath frosting in the cold morning air. Gelmarr had equipped himself with a longaxe whose reach would allow him to strike before the wolves were on him. The blade was heavy enough to kill with a single blow. Aggar wore steel greaves. Reek arrived carrying a boar spear and an overstuffed washerwoman's sack bulging with god knows what. Theon had his bow; he needed nothing else. Once he had saved Bran's life with an arrow.

Beyond the outer wall, the tracks were plain to read in the soft ground; the pawprints of the wolves, Hodor's heavy tread, the shallower marks left by the feet of the two Reeds. Once under the trees, the stony ground and fallen leaves made the trail harder to see, but by then Farlen's red bitch had the scent. The rest of the dogs were close behind, the hounds sniffing and barking, a pair of monstrous mastiffs bringing up the rear. Their size and ferocity might make the difference against a cornered direwolf.</div>

Force and fear could carry you only so far. A pity Ned Stark had taken his daughters south; elsewise Theon could have tightened his grip on Winterfell by marrying one of them.

<div class="line_en">Somehow Osha and the wretched boys were eluding him. It should not have been possible, not on foot, burdened with a cripple and a young child. Every passing hour increased the likelihood that they would make good their escape. If they reach a village… The people of the north would never deny Ned Stark's sons, Robb's brothers.

The wolves might have come out on either bank. Theon kept an eye out for tracks, spoor, broken branches, any hint as to where the direwolves might have left the water. He spied the prints of deer, elk, and badger easily enough. Wex surprised a vixen drinking at the stream, and Walder flushed three rabbits from the underbrush and managed to put an arrow in one. They saw the claw marks where a bear had shredded the bark of a tall birch. But of the direwolves there was no sign.</div>

Where a fallen tree dammed the flow, the hunters were forced to loop around a deep green pool, but if the direwolves had done the same they'd left neither print nor spoor.
