<div class="line_en">The Palmers returned to Cleveland the next day, and the two families atBarton were again left to entertain each other. But this did not lastlong; Elinor had hardly got their last visitors out of her head, hadhardly done wondering at Charlotte's being so happy without a cause, atMr. Palmer's acting so simply, with good abilities, and at the strangeunsuitableness which often existed between husband and wife, before SirJohn's and Mrs. Jennings's active zeal in the cause of society, procured her some other new acquaintance to see and observe.</div>

<div class="line_en">In a morning's excursion to Exeter, they had met with two young ladies, whom Mrs. Jennings had the satisfaction of discovering to be herrelations, and this was enough for Sir John to invite them directly tothe park, as soon as their present engagements at Exeter were over. Their engagements at Exeter instantly gave way before such aninvitation, and Lady Middleton was thrown into no little alarm on thereturn of Sir John, by hearing that she was very soon to receive avisit from two girls whom she had never seen in her life, and of whoseelegance, -- whose tolerable gentility even, she could have no proof; forthe assurances of her husband and mother on that subject went fornothing at all. Their being her relations too made it so much theworse; and Mrs. Jennings's attempts at consolation were thereforeunfortunately founded, when she advised her daughter not to care abouttheir being so fashionable; because they were all cousins and must putup with one another. As it was impossible, however, now to preventtheir coming, Lady Middleton resigned herself to the idea of it, withall the philosophy of a well-bred woman, contenting herself with merelygiving her husband a gentle reprimand on the subject five or six timesevery day.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一天早晨，大伙儿去埃克塞特游览，恰巧遇见两位小姐。詹宁斯太太高兴地发现，这两人还是她的亲戚，这就足以使约翰爵士邀请她们在埃克塞特的约期一满，便马上去巴顿庄园。他这么一邀请，她们在埃克塞特的约期也就即将结束了。约翰爵士回家后，米德尔顿夫人闻知不久要接待两位小姐来访，不禁大为惊愕。她生平从未见过这两位小姐，无从证明她们是不是文雅——甚至无从证明她们算不算得上有相当教养，因此她丈夫和母亲在这方面的保证根本不能作数。她们还是她的亲戚，这就把事情搞得更不妙了。詹宁斯大大试图安慰她，劝说她别去计较她们过于时髦，因为她们都是表姐妹，总得互相包涵着点。其实，这是无的放矢。事到如今，要制止她们来是办不到了。米德尔顿夫人采取一个教养有素的女人的乐观态度，对这事只好听之任之，每天和风细雨地责怪丈夫五六次也就足够了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The young ladies arrived: their appearance was by no means ungenteel orunfashionable. Their dress was very smart, their manners very civil, they were delighted with the house, and in raptures with the furniture, and they happened to be so doatingly fond of children that LadyMiddleton's good opinion was engaged in their favour before they hadbeen an hour at the Park. She declared them to be very agreeable girlsindeed, which for her ladyship was enthusiastic admiration. Sir John'sconfidence in his own judgment rose with this animated praise, and heset off directly for the cottage to tell the Miss Dashwoods of the MissSteeles' arrival, and to assure them of their being the sweetest girlsin the world. From such commendation as this, however, there was notmuch to be learned; Elinor well knew that the sweetest girls in theworld were to be met with in every part of England, under everypossible variation of form, face, temper and understanding. Sir Johnwanted the whole family to walk to the Park directly and look at hisguests. Benevolent, philanthropic man! It was painful to him even tokeep a third cousin to himself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两位小姐到达了。从外观看，她们绝非有失文雅，绝非不入时。她们的穿着非常时髦，举止彬彬有礼，对房子十分中意，对房里的陈设喜爱得不得了。没想到她们会那样娇爱几个孩子，在巴顿庄园还没呆上一个小时，就博得了米德尔顿夫人的好感。她当众宣布，她们的确是两位十分讨人喜欢的小姐。对于这位爵士夫人来说，这是很热烈的赞赏。约翰爵士听到这番热情的赞扬，对自己的眼力更加充满了自信，当即跑到乡舍，告诉达什伍德家小姐，两位斯蒂尔小姐来了，并且向她们保证，斯蒂尔姐妹是天下最可爱的小姐。不过，只听这样的夸奖，你也了解不到多少东西。埃丽诺心里明白：天下最可爱的小姐在英格兰到处都能碰见，她们的体态、脸蛋、脾气、智力千差万别。约翰爵士要求达什伍德家全家出动，马上去巴顿庄园见见他的客人。真是个仁慈善良的人儿！即令是两个远房内表妹，不介绍给别人也会使他感到难受的。">查看中文翻译</div>

He could only obtain a promise oftheir calling at the Park within a day or two, and then left them inamazement at their indifference, to walk home and boast anew of theirattractions to the Miss Steeles, as he had been already boasting of theMiss Steeles to them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，约翰爵士说不服她们。他只能让她们答应一两天内去拜访，然后告辞回去，对她们如此无动于衷深感惊奇。他回到家，又把她们的妩媚多姿向两位斯蒂尔小姐吹嘘了一番，就像他刚才向她们吹嘘两位斯蒂尔小姐一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When their promised visit to the Park and consequent introduction tothese young ladies took place, they found in the appearance of theeldest, who was nearly thirty, with a very plain and not a sensibleface, nothing to admire; but in the other, who was not more than two orthree and twenty, they acknowledged considerable beauty; her featureswere pretty, and she had a sharp quick eye, and a smartness of air, which though it did not give actual elegance or grace, gave distinctionto her person. -- Their manners were particularly civil, and Elinor soonallowed them credit for some kind of sense, when she saw with whatconstant and judicious attention they were making themselves agreeableto Lady Middleton. With her children they were in continual raptures, extolling their beauty, courting their notice, and humouring theirwhims; and such of their time as could be spared from the importunatedemands which this politeness made on it, was spent in admiration ofwhatever her ladyship was doing, if she happened to be doing any thing, or in taking patterns of some elegant new dress, in which herappearance the day before had thrown them into unceasing delight. Fortunately for those who pay their court through such foibles, a fondmother, though, in pursuit of praise for her children, the mostrapacious of human beings, is likewise the most credulous; her demandsare exorbitant; but she will swallow any thing; and the excessiveaffection and endurance of the Miss Steeles towards her offspring wereviewed therefore by Lady Middleton without the smallest surprise ordistrust. She saw with maternal complacency all the impertinentencroachments and mischievous tricks to which her cousins submitted. She saw their sashes untied, their hair pulled about their ears, theirwork-bags searched, and their knives and scissors stolen away, and feltno doubt of its being a reciprocal enjoyment. It suggested no othersurprise than that Elinor and Marianne should sit so composedly by, without claiming a share in what was passing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她们按照事先的许诺来到巴顿庄园，并被介绍给两位小姐。她们发现，那姐姐年近三十，脸蛋长得很一般，看上去就不明睿，一点也不值得称羡。可是那位妹妹，她们都觉得相当俏丽。她不过二十二三岁，面貌清秀，目光敏锐，神态机灵，纵使不觉得真正高雅俊美，也够得上人品出众。姐妹俩的态度特别谦恭，埃丽诺见她们总是那么审慎周到地取悦米德尔顿夫人，不禁马上认识到她们还真懂点情理。她们一直都在同她的孩子嬉戏，称赞他们长得漂亮，逗引他们，满足他们种种奇怪的念头。在礼貌周到地与孩子们纠缠之余，不是赞许爵士夫人碰巧在忙碌什么事情，就是量取她头天穿的、曾使他们赞羡不已的新式艳服的图样。值得庆幸的是，对于阿谀成癖的人来说，溺爱子女的母亲虽然一味追求别人对自己子女的赞扬，贪婪之情无以复加，但又同样最容易轻信。这种人贪得无厌，轻信一切；因此，斯蒂尔姐妹妹对小家伙的过分溺爱和忍让，米德尔顿夫人丝毫不感到惊奇和猜疑。看到两位表姐妹受到小家伙的无礼冒犯和恶意捉弄，她这做母亲的反倒自鸣得意起来。她眼看着她们的腰带被解开，头发被抓乱，针线袋被搜遍，刀、剪被偷走，而毫不怀疑这仅仅是一种相互逗趣而已。令人诧异的是，埃丽诺和玛丽安居然能安之若素地坐在一旁，却不肯介入眼前的嬉闹。">查看中文翻译</div>

You will be delighted withthem I am sure. They have brought the whole coach full of playthingsfor the children. How can you be so cross as not to come?

<div class="line_en">But unfortunately in bestowing these embraces, a pin in her ladyship'shead dress slightly scratching the child's neck, produced from thispattern of gentleness such violent screams, as could hardly be outdoneby any creature professedly noisy. The mother's consternation wasexcessive; but it could not surpass the alarm of the Miss Steeles, andevery thing was done by all three, in so critical an emergency, whichaffection could suggest as likely to assuage the agonies of the littlesufferer. She was seated in her mother's lap, covered with kisses, herwound bathed with lavender-water, by one of the Miss Steeles, who wason her knees to attend her, and her mouth stuffed with sugar plums bythe other. With such a reward for her tears, the child was too wise tocease crying. She still screamed and sobbed lustily, kicked her twobrothers for offering to touch her, and all their united soothings wereineffectual till Lady Middleton luckily remembering that in a scene ofsimilar distress last week, some apricot marmalade had beensuccessfully applied for a bruised temple, the same remedy was eagerlyproposed for this unfortunate scratch, and a slight intermission ofscreams in the young lady on hearing it, gave them reason to hope thatit would not be rejected. -- She was carried out of the room thereforein her mother's arms, in quest of this medicine, and as the two boyschose to follow, though earnestly entreated by their mother to staybehind, the four young ladies were left in a quietness which the roomhad not known for many hours.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而不幸的是，正当米德尔顿夫人亲热搂抱的时候，不料她头饰上的别针轻轻划了一下孩子的脖颈，惹得这位文静的小家伙尖叫不止，气势汹汹，简直连自称最能吵闹的小家伙也望尘莫及。孩子的母亲顿时张皇失措，但是还比不上斯蒂尔妹妹的惊恐之状。在这紧急关头，似乎只有千疼万爱才能减轻这位小受难者的痛苦，于是三人一个个忙得不可开交。做母亲的把小站娘抱在膝上，亲个不停；一位斯蒂尔小姐双膝跪在地上，往伤口上涂洒薰衣草香水；另一位斯蒂尔小姐直往小家伙嘴里塞糖果。既然眼泪可以赢来这么多好处，这小机灵鬼索性没完没了地哭下去。她继续拼命地大哭大叫，两个哥哥要来摸摸她，她抬脚就踢。眼看大家同心合力都哄她不好，米德尔顿夫人侥幸地记起，上周发生一起同样不幸的事件。那次，小家伙的太阳穴擦伤了，后来吃点杏子酱就好了。于是她赶忙提议采取同样办法治疗这不幸的擦伤。小姑娘听到后，尖叫声稍微中断了一会儿，这就给大家带来了希望，心想她是不会拒绝杏子酱的。因此，她母亲把她抱出房去，寻找这灵丹妙药。虽然母亲恳求两个男孩呆在房里，他们却偏要跟着一起出来。于是留下四位小姐，几个小时以来，室内头一次安静下来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="斯蒂尔姐妹并不这样想。她们从埃克塞特来的时候，早就对约翰爵士夫妇及其亲属的为人处世充满了倾慕之情，而这倾慕之情有很大成分是针对他的漂亮的表侄女的。她们公开声称：达什伍德妹妹是她们见过的最美丽、最优雅、最多才多艺、最和蔼可亲的小姐，迫切希望与她们建立深交。埃丽诺很快发现，建立深交乃是她们不可避免的命运，因为约翰爵士完全站在斯蒂尔妹妹一边，他们举行聚会非要请上她们，真是盛情难却，只好屈就，这就意味着几乎每天都要在同一间房里连续坐上一两个钟头。约翰爵士使不出更多的招数，也不知道需要有更多的招数。据他看来，呆在一起就算关系密切，只要他能切实有效地安排她们经常聚会，他就不怀疑她们已成为牢靠的朋友。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Elinor could not suppose that Sir John would be more nice inproclaiming his suspicions of her regard for Edward, than he had beenwith respect to Marianne; indeed it was rather his favourite joke ofthe two, as being somewhat newer and more conjectural; and sinceEdward's visit, they had never dined together without his drinking toher best affections with so much significancy and so many nods andwinks, as to excite general attention. The letter F-had been likewiseinvariably brought forward, and found productive of such countlessjokes, that its character as the wittiest letter in the alphabet hadbeen long established with Elinor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃丽诺觉得，约翰爵士当众宣布他怀疑她与爱德华相好，这并不会比他怀疑玛丽安时更注意分寸。事实上，两者比较起来，爵士更喜欢开埃丽诺的玩笑，因为这个玩笑更新鲜，更费揣测。自从爱德华来访后，每次在一起吃饭时，他总要意味深长地举杯祝她情场如意，一面频频点头眨眼，引起了众人的注目。那个“费”字也总是被一再端出来，逗引出不计其数的玩笑，以至于在埃丽诺心目中，早就被确立为天下最奇妙的一个字儿。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Miss Steeles, as she expected, had now all the benefit of thesejokes, and in the eldest of them they raised a curiosity to know thename of the gentleman alluded to, which, though often impertinentlyexpressed, was perfectly of a piece with her general inquisitivenessinto the concerns of their family. But Sir John did not sport longwith the curiosity which he delighted to raise, for he had at least asmuch pleasure in telling the name, as Miss Steele had in hearing it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不出所料，斯蒂尔姐妹这下子可从这些玩笑里捞到了把柄。那位大小姐一时来了好奇心，一定要知道那位先生的尊姓大名。她的话虽然往往说得没轻没重，但是却跟她专爱打听她们家的闲事的举动完全一致。约翰爵士尽管十分乐于引逗别人的好奇心，但他没有长时间地引逗下去，因为正像斯蒂尔小姐很想听到那个名字一样，他也很想当众说出来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Elinor heard all this with attention and surprise. "And who was thisuncle? Where did he live? How came they acquainted?" She wished verymuch to have the subject continued, though she did not chuse to join init herself; but nothing more of it was said, and for the first time inher life, she thought Mrs. Jennings deficient either in curiosity afterpetty information, or in a disposition to communicate it. The mannerin which Miss Steele had spoken of Edward, increased her curiosity; forit struck her as being rather ill-natured, and suggested the suspicionof that lady's knowing, or fancying herself to know something to hisdisadvantage. -- But her curiosity was unavailing, for no farther noticewas taken of Mr. Ferrars's name by Miss Steele when alluded to, or evenopenly mentioned by Sir John.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这一席话，埃丽诺听得仔细，也很诧异。“这位舅父是谁？他住在何处？他们是怎么认识的？”她很希望这话题能继续下去，虽然她自己不想介入。不料两人没有说下去，而埃丽诺生平第一次感到，詹宁斯太太既缺乏打听的好奇心，又缺乏通报消息的自觉性。斯蒂尔小姐说起爱德华时的那副神气，进一步激起了她的好奇心，因为她觉得那位小姐情绪不对头，怀疑她了解（或者自以为了解）爱德华有什么不光彩的事情，但是她的好奇纯属无益，因为约翰爵士暗示也好，明摆也罢，斯蒂尔小姐都没再去理会费拉斯先生的名字。">查看中文翻译</div>
