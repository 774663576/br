<div class="line_en">After Ye Wenjie finished recounting the history of her first contact with Trisolaris, the abandoned cafeteria remained silent. Many present were apparently just hearing the complete story for the first time. Wang was deeply absorbed by the narrative and temporarily forgot about the danger and terror he faced. Unable to stop himself, he asked, "How did the ETO then develop to its present scale?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"This… Lord that you talk about. Why is it so afraid of nanomaterial?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你们所说的……主。为什么这样害怕纳米材料呢？”汪淼问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ye replied, "I'd have to start with how I got to know Evans… But every comrade here already knows that part of history, so we shouldn't waste time on it now. I can tell you later. However, whether we'll have such an opportunity depends on you… Xiao Wang, let's talk about your nanomaterial."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="叶文洁回答：“这要从我认识伊文斯说起……不过，这段历史在场的同志们都知道，我们就不要在这上面浪费时间了。以后我可以单独为你讲，但是否有这个机会，就要看你自己了……小汪，我们还是谈谈你的纳米材料吧，”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The space elevator?" Wang suddenly understood.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“太空电梯？”汪淼立刻想到了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes. If ultrastrong nanomaterials could be mass produced, then that would lay the technical foundation for building a space elevator from the ground up to a geostationary point in space. For our Lord, this is but a tiny invention; but for humans on Earth, its meaning would be significant. With this technology, humans could easily enter near-Earth space and build up large-scale defensive structures. Thus, this technology must be extinguished."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，那种超高强度的材料一旦能够大规模生产，建设从地表直达地球同步轨道的太空电梯就有了技术基础。对主而言，这只是一项很小的发明，但对地球人类却意义重大。地球人类可以凭借这项技术轻易地进入近地空间。在太空建立起大规模的防御体系便成为可能。所以，必须扑灭这项技术。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"What is at the end of the countdown?" Wang asked the question that frightened him the most.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“倒计肘的终点是什么？”汪淼问出了这个令他恐惧的问题。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But trying to stop me is useless! This is not basic research. Based on what we've already found out, someone else can figure out the rest." Wang's voice was loud but anxious.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你们这样做没有意义！这不是基础研究，大方向对了别人也能做出来的！”汪淼紧张地大声说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Speaking of basic research, how did your daughter die?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“说到基础研究，你女儿是怎么死的？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The question silenced Ye for a few seconds. Wang noticed that her eyes dimmed almost imperceptibly. But she then resumed the conversation. "Indeed, compared to our Lord, who possesses peerless strength, everything we do is meaningless. We're just doing whatever we can."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这问题令叶文洁沉默了几秒钟，汪淼注意到，她的眼神几乎不为人察觉地黯淡了一下，但旋即接下了剐才的话题，“其实，对于无比强大的主来说，我们做的一切都没有意义，我们只是做自己想做的事。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes, it is rather useless. It's far more effective to confuse the researchers' minds. But, like you point out, we didn't stop the progress in time. After all, what you do is applied research. Our technique is far more effective against basic research…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是没有意义，能够扰乱研究者的思想是最有效的，但我们做得不理想，如你所说．这毕竟是应用研究，不像对基础研究那么有效……”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Just as she finished speaking, several loud booms rang out and the doors to the cafeteria broke open. A team of soldiers holding submachine guns rushed in. Wang realized that they were not armed police, but the real army. Noiselessly they proceeded along the walls and soon surrounded the rebels of the ETO.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="叶文洁话音刚落，轰然几声巨响，饭厅的两扇大门同时被撞开，一群端冲锋枪的士兵冲了进来。汪淼注意到他们不是武警而是正规军，他们几乎无声地贴墙而行，很快在三体叛军周围形成了一个包围圈。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Shi Qiang was the last to enter. His jacket was open, and he held the barrel of a pistol so that the grip was like the head of a hammer. Da Shi looked around arrogantly, then suddenly dashed forward. His hand flashed and there was the dull thud of metal striking against a skull. An ETO rebel fell to the ground, and the gun that he was trying to draw tumbled to fall some distance away. Several soldiers began to shoot at the ceiling, and dust and debris fell. Someone grabbed Wang Miao and pulled him away from the ETO ranks until he was safe behind a row of soldiers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="史强最后走了进来，皮夹克敞着怀，手里握着枪管，枪柄像一把榔头似的露出来。他大大咧咧地四下看看．突然冲向前去，倒握着枪的手一抡，响起了金属砸在头骨上的闷响，一名三体战士倒了下去，没来得及抽出的手枪捧出老远。几名士兵冲天鸣枪，天花板上落下一片尘土。有人拉起汪淼，飞快地跑出了三体叛军的人群，站到一排士兵后面。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Drop all your weapons onto the table! I swear I'm going to kill the next son of a bitch who tries anything." Da Shi pointed at the submachine guns arrayed behind him. "I know that none of you is afraid to die, but we're not afraid either. I'm going to say this up front: Normal police procedures and laws don't apply to you. Even the human laws of warfare no longer apply to you. Since you've decided to treat the entire human race as your enemy, there's no longer anything we wouldn't do to you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“武器都丢桌子上！谁再炸刺，穿了丫的！史强指指身后的一排冲锋枪说：“知道各位都是不要命的，我们也是冲不要命来的！我可把话搁这儿了：普通的警务和法律禁区，对你们已经不适用，甚至人类的战争法则对你们也不适用了！既然你们已经与全人类为敌，咱们大家也都没什么可忌讳的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was some commotion among the ETO members, but no one panicked. Ye's face remained impassive. Three people suddenly rushed out of the crowd, including the young woman who had twisted Pan Han's neck. They ran toward the three-body sculpture, and each grabbed one of the spheres and held it in front of his or her chest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="三体叛军的人群中有一阵骚动，但并没有大的惊慌。叶文洁不动声色。有三个人突然冲出人群，其中包括扭断潘寒脖子的那个美丽女孩儿，他们冲向那座活动的三体艺术品，一个人抓住了—颗翻飞的金属球，紧紧拖在胸前。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The young woman raised the bright metal sphere before her with both hands, as though she were getting ready to start a gymnastics routine. Smiling, she said, "Officers, we hold in our hands three nuclear bombs, each with a yield of about one point five kilotons. Not too big, since we like small toys. This is the detonator."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="美丽女孩双手托起晶亮的金属球，让人联想到身材苗条的艺术体操运动员。她又露出那动人的笑，用悦耳的声音说：“各位警官，我们手里拿着的是三枚原子弹，每枚当量一千五百吨级，不算大，我们喜欢小玩艺儿，这是起爆开关。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Everyone in the cafeteria froze. The only one who moved was Shi Qiang. He put his gun back into the holster under his left arm and placed his hands together calmly.</div>

<div class="line_en">The young woman laughed once more and picked up the bag herself. She loaded her sphere into the bag, hung it on the hook of the scale, and the gauge immediately dropped to its bottom, the spring in the scale having been fully extended.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="女孩又笑了一声，接过塑料袋将球装了进去，挂到弹簧秤上，标尺哗地一下直落到底。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The young woman chuckled. The explosives expert also laughed, contemptuously. The ETO member took out the sphere and tossed it on the ground. Another ETO fighter picked up the scale and the bag and repeated the procedure with his sphere, and ended up also tossing the sphere to the ground.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="女孩儿哈哈一笑，这边的爆炸物专家也轻蔑地笑笑。另一个拿球的人也照样称了球，然后也将球扔了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The officer threw a bag in front of the three ETO members holding the spheres. One of the ETO fighters picked up the bag and took out a spring scale, a bigger version of the ones some customers brought to street markets to verify the portions measured by vendors. He placed his metal sphere into the bag, attached it to the spring scale, and held it aloft. The gauge extended about halfway and stopped.</div>

<div class="line_en">The flashlights attached to the soldiers' guns focused on the young woman holding the nuclear bomb. While she held the destructive power of 1.5 kilotons of TNT in her hands, she smiled brightly, as though enjoying applause and praise on a spotlit stage.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="士兵们枪上电筒的光柱集中在那个拿核弹的女孩儿身上，这个艳丽的死亡之花手捧着一千五百吨TNT，灿烂地笑着，仿佛是在舞台聚光灯下迎接着掌声和赞美。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Calm down," Da Shi said, standing about seven or eight meters from her. He took an envelope from his pocket. "I have some information you'll definitely want to know. Your mother has been found."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“悠着点儿丫头，有件事你肯定想知道。”大史站在距女孩七八米远处，从衣袋中掏出一个信封，“你母亲找到了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Da Shi took two steps forward. He was now no more than five meters from her. She raised the bomb and warned him with her eyes, but she was already distracted. One of the two ETO members who had tossed away fake bombs strode toward Da Shi to take the envelope from him. As the man blocked the woman's view of Da Shi, he drew his gun with a lightning-fast motion. The woman only saw a flash by the ear of the man trying to take the letter from Da Shi before the bomb in her hands exploded.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大史趁机又向前跨了两步，将自己与女孩的间距缩短至五米左右。女孩警惕地一举核弹，用目光制止了他。但她的注意力已经被大大分散了。刚才扔掉假核弹的两人中的一个向大史走来，伸手来拿他举着的信封。大史闪电般抽出手枪，他抽枪的动作正好被取信的人挡住，女孩没有看到。她只看到取信人的耳边亮光一闪，怀中的核弹就被击中爆炸了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After hearing the muffled explosion, Wang saw nothing before his eyes but darkness. Someone dragged him out of the cafeteria. Thick, yellow smoke poured out of the door, and a cacophony of shouting and gunshots came from inside. From time to time, people rushed through the smoke and out of the cafeteria.</div>

The explosion had turned the nuclear woman into a bloody mess, but she was the only casualty of the aborted bomb. The man who had tried to take the letter from Da Shi was severely injured, but since his body had shielded Da Shi, his wounds were light.
