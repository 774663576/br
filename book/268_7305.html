<div class="line_en">I enjoyed the sun, too, though the air wasn't quite dry enough for my taste. I would have liked to lie back, as he did, and let the sun warm my face. But I stayed curled up, my chin resting on my knees, unwilling to take my eyes off him. The wind was gentle; it tangled my hair and ruffled the grass that swayed around his motionless form.</div>

<div class="line_en">Now and then, his lips would move, so fast it looked like they were trembling. But, when I asked, he told me he was singing to himself; it was too low for me to hear.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="时不时地，他的嘴唇飞快地动着，仿佛是在颤抖。但是，当我问道的时候，他告诉他在哼着歌，因为声音太低了所以我听不见。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Edward in the sunlight was shocking. I couldn't get used to it, though I'd been staring at him all afternoon. His skin, white despite the faint flush from yesterday's hunting trip, literally sparkled, like thousands of tiny diamonds were embedded in the surface. He lay perfectly still in the grass, his shirt open over his sculpted, incandescent chest, his scintillating arms bare. His glistening, pale lavender lids were shut, though of course he didn't sleep. A perfect statue, carved in some unknown stone, smooth like marble, glittering like crystal.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阳光下的爱德华太惊人了，我还是没能习惯这件事，尽管整个下午我都在盯着他看。他的肌肤，雪白中带着昨天的狩猎之旅带来的淡淡红晕，简直在闪闪发光，就好像有千万颗极小的钻石镶嵌在上面一样。他静静地躺在草地上，看上去是那么的完美，他的衬衫敞开着，露出宛如雕刻成的，光辉夺目的胸膛，他闪闪发光的手臂袒露着。他微微发着光的，淡紫色的眼睑紧闭着，但是，当然他不可能是在睡觉。他就像一座完美的雕像，是用某种未知的，光滑如大理石，灿烂如水晶的石头雕刻而成的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Hesitantly, always afraid, even now, that he would disappear like a mirage, too beautiful to be real… hesitantly, I reached out one finger and stroked the back of his shimmering hand, where it lay within my reach. I marveled again at the perfect texture, satin smooth, cool as stone. When I looked up again, his eyes were open, watching me. Butterscotch today, lighter, warmer after hunting. His quick smile turned up the corners of his flawless lips.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我迟疑着，即使是现在，我也总是担心着，生怕他会像海市蜃楼一样消失，他太美丽了，根本不像现实存在的…我迟疑着伸出了一根手指，轻抚着近在咫尺的，他闪烁着微光的手背。我又一次震惊于那完美的肌理，光洁如绸缎，冰冷如石头。当我再次抬头看去时，他的眼睛睁开了，正看着我。今天他的眼睛是奶油糖果的颜色，在狩猎以后，变得更明亮，更温暖了。一抹轻快的笑容浮现在他毫无瑕疵的唇角。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I don't scare you?" he asked playfully, but I could hear the real curiosity in his soft voice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我没吓到你吗？”他打趣地问道，但我能听出他柔软的声音里真正的好奇。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I inched closer, stretched out my whole hand now to trace the contours of his forearm with my fingertips. I saw that my fingers trembled, and knew it wouldn't escape his notice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我缓缓地挪到更近的地方，张开手伸过去，用指尖描摹着他小臂的轮廓。我看见自己的手指在颤抖着，知道这一切都逃不过他的注意。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No," he said without opening his eyes. "You can't imagine how that feels." He sighed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不。”他说着，没有睁开眼。“你不会想象到这是什么样的感觉。”他叹息着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I lightly trailed my hand over the perfect muscles of his arm, followed the faint pattern of bluish veins inside the crease at his elbow. With my other hand, I reached to turn his hand over. Realizing what I wished, he flipped his palm up in one of those blindingly fast, disconcerting movements of his. It startled me; my fingers froze on his arm for a brief second.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我轻柔地用手抚过他手臂上完美的肌肉，跟随着他肘弯上浅浅的淡蓝色静脉的纹路。我伸出另一只手，想把他的手掌翻过来。他意识到了我想做什么，立刻把掌心翻过来，动作快得看不见，简直让人仓皇失措。他的动作让我吓了一跳，我的手指在他手臂上停滞了片刻。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So quickly that I missed his movement, he was half sitting, propped up on his right arm, his left palm still in my hands. His angel's face was only a few inches from mine. I might have -- should have -- flinched away from his unexpected closeness, but I was unable to move. His golden eyes mesmerized me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的动作太快了，我完全没看见他移动。他半坐起来，用右臂支撑着身体，他的左手掌依然在我的手里。他天使般的面孔离我的脸只有几英寸远。我本可能——本应该——因为他出乎意料的接近而退缩的，但我没法移动。他金色的眸子催眠了我。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I lifted his hand, turning it this way and that as I watched the sun glitter on his palm. I held it closer to my face, trying to see the hidden facets in his skin.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我拿起他的手，向自己翻过来，这样我就能看见阳光在他手心里闪烁着。我把他的手拿得更靠近自己的脸，试图看清楚藏在他肌肤里的刻面。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我不想让你害怕。”他的声音仅仅是一种柔和的喃喃低语。我听出了他无法深信不疑地说出口的事情——我不必感到害怕，这里没有什么可怕的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But I couldn't answer. As I had just that once before, I smelled his cool breath in my face. Sweet, delicious, the scent made my mouth water. It was unlike anything else. Instinctively, unthinkingly, I leaned closer, inhaling.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但我没有回答。就像之前我曾经试过一次那样，我闻到了他冰冷的呼吸，呼在我脸上。甜腻，美味，这种香味让我口齿生津。它不像别的任何味道。我本能地，不假思索地靠得更近些，轻嗅着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What are you afraid of, then?" he whispered intently.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那么，你在害怕着什么？”他专注地看着我，耳语道。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And he was gone, his hand ripped from mine. In the time it took my eyes to focus, he was twenty feet away, standing at the edge of the small meadow, in the deep shade of a huge fir tree. He stared at me, his eyes dark in the shadows, his expression unreadable.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后他消失了，他的手从我的手中挣脱出来。当我凝眸望去的时候，他已在二十英尺外，站在这片小小的草地的边缘，在一棵巨大的杉树的浓重的树荫里。他注视着我，他的眼睛在阴影里暗沉着，他的表情难以读懂。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I could feel the hurt and shock on my face. My empty hands stung.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我能感到自己脸上的痛楚和震惊。我空空的手心刺痛着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After ten incredibly long seconds, he walked back, slowly for him. He stopped, still several feet away, and sank gracefully to the ground, crossing his legs. His eyes never left mine. He took two deep breaths, and then smiled in apology.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在漫长得难以置信的十分钟以后，他用对他来说相当缓慢的速度走过来。他停在了在几英尺外的地方，优雅地坐到了地上，盘起腿。他的目光从未离开过我的眼睛。他做了两次深呼吸。然后满怀歉意地笑了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Give me a moment," he called, just loud enough for my less sensitive ears. I sat very still.</div>

<div class="line_en">I nodded once, not quite able to smile at his joke. Adrenaline pulsed through my veins as the realization of danger slowly sank in. He could smell that from where he sat. His smile turned mocking.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我点了点头，没法对他的笑话微笑。作为一种对危险的响应，肾上腺素在我的血管里奔涌着，但也在慢慢地平息下来。他能从他坐着的地方闻到这一切。他的笑容变得嘲讽起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He reached up with one hand and, with a deafening crack, effortlessly ripped a two-foot-thick branch from the trunk of the spruce. He balanced it in that hand for a moment, and then threw it with blinding speed, shattering it against another huge tree, which shook and trembled at the blow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他伸出一只手，然后随着一声震耳欲聋的爆裂声，他毫不费力地从那棵云杉的树干上扯下一根直径达两英尺的树枝。他单手把它举了片刻，然后把它扔出去，速度快得看不见。那根树枝在另一棵巨树上砸得粉碎，砸得那棵巨树一阵震动，带起一阵颤动的风。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I'm the world's best predator, aren't I? Everything about me invites you in -- my voice, my face, even my smell. As if I need any of that!" Unexpectedly, he was on his feet, bounding away, instantly out of sight, only to appear beneath the same tree as before, having circled the meadow in half a second.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我是这个世界上最棒的掠食者，不是吗？我的一切都在邀请着你——我的声音，我的容貌，甚至是我的气味。就好像我需要这些一样！”出人意料的是，他站起来跳开了，立刻消失在我的眼前，然后出现在之前的同一棵树下。他在半秒钟内就绕了这片空地一圈。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"As if you could fight me off," he said gently.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="我一动不动地坐在那里，被他吓到了，比我曾经体会过的还要更害怕。我从没见过他如此彻底地从那张小心翼翼的，有教养的假面具下解放出来。他从未像现在这样，更不像人类…或者更加美丽。我的脸色发灰，眼睛睁大了，我坐在那里，就像一只被蛇的目光锁住了小鸟。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“别害怕。”他喃喃低语道，他天鹅绒般的声音充满了无心的诱惑。“我保证…”他犹豫了一下。“我发誓我不会伤害你的。”他不止是在说服我，他似乎更想让他自己坚信这一点。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Don't be afraid," he whispered again as he stepped closer, with exaggerated slowness. He sat sinuously, with deliberately unhurried movements, till our faces were on the same level, just a foot apart.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“别害怕。”他又一次低声耳语道，走得更近些，步子缓慢得夸张。他弯曲着身子坐下来，故意让动作显得从容不迫，直到我们脸在同一水平线上，只有一步之遥。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我总是那么容易感到沮丧。”他叹息着说。我看进他的眼睛里，意外地领悟到，这一刻每一点每一滴对他来说都是新的，正如对我一样。即使他拥有着这么多年来深不可测的经历，这对他来说，也很艰难。我从这个念头中得到了勇气。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I tried that, and it helped a little. I breathed in and out slowly, keeping my head very still. I felt him sitting beside me. The moments passed, and eventually I found that I could raise my head. There was a hollow ringing sound in my ears.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我试着做到这一点，而这确实有些作用。我慢慢地吸气，呼气，让我的头保持不动。我感到他就坐在我旁边。过了一会，我发现我终于可以抬起头了。我的耳朵里回荡着空洞的耳鸣声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I guess that wasn't the best idea," he mused.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我猜这不是个好主意。”他沉思着，说道。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I can't argue with that," I sighed. There was no way around it; I couldn't resist him in anything. I held the key high and dropped it, watching his hand flash like lightning to catch it soundlessly. "Take it easy -- my truck is a senior citizen."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不能反驳这一点。”我叹息说。没有办法绕过这一点。我在任何事情上都无法拒绝他。我高举起钥匙，松开手让它落下来，看着他的手闪电般地掠过，无声地抓住它。“当心点——我的车可是上了年纪的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
