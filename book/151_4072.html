<div class="line_en">When we got back to our section in front of the movie screen, no one had even noticed we'd been gone. Mr. Tushman and Ms. Rubin and Summer and all the rest of the kids were just watching the movie. They had no clue how something bad had almost happened to me and Jack. It's so weird how that can be, how you could have a night that's the worst in your life, but to everybody else it's just an ordinary night. Like, on my calendar at home, I would mark this as being one of the most horrific days of my life. This and the day Daisy died. But for the rest of the world, this was just an ordinary day. Or maybe it was even a good day. Maybe somebody won the lottery today.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then they came out of the narrow valley and at once she saw the reason. There stood Peter and Edmund and all the rest of Aslan's army fighting desperately against the crowd of horrible creatures whom she had seen last night; only now, in the daylight, they looked even stranger and more evil and more deformed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="等她们走出狭窄的山谷的时候，她立刻就知道了原因。彼得和爱德蒙带了阿斯兰其余的军队正拼命跟她昨晚看见过的那群可怕的动物战斗，只不过如今在日光下，那些动物看上去更怪、更恶、更丑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I stopped there. I'd been reading for over an hour and sleep still didn't come. It was almost two a. m. Everyone else was asleep. I had my flashlight on under the sleeping bag, and maybe the light was why I couldn't sleep, but I was too afraid to turn it off. I was afraid of how dark it was outside the sleeping bag.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="读到这里，我停了下来。我已经看了一个多小时的书，却依然没有睡意。现在差不多凌晨两点了，大家都睡着了。我把手电筒搁在睡袋里，也许光是我睡不着的原因，但我不敢把它关掉，我害怕睡袋外面的一片漆黑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Amos, Miles, and Henry brought me and Jack over to where we'd been sitting before, with Summer and Maya and Reid, and then they went and sat where they had been sitting before, with Ximena and Savanna and their group. In a way, everything was exactly as we had left it before we went looking for the toilets. The sky was the same. The movie was the same. Everyone's faces were the same. Mine was the same.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿莫斯、迈尔斯、亨利带我和杰克回到我们原来的位置，就在萨默尔、玛雅和瑞德旁边，然后他们回到了他们原来的位置，跟西蒙娜、萨凡娜和她们的小圈子在一起。在某种程度上，一切都跟我们去上厕所之前没什么两样。天空是一样的，正在放的电影是一样的，每个人的脸都是一样的，我的脸也一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was what everyone was talking about on the bus ride back to the cabins. All the girls, even girls I didn't know very well, were asking me if I was okay. The boys were all talking about getting revenge on the group of seventh-grade jerks, trying to figure out what school they were from.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在乘大巴回小木屋的路上每个人都在议论这件事。所有的女生，哪怕我不熟悉的都纷纷向我嘘寒问暖。男生们都说要报复七年级的这几个学生，一定要查出他们到底是什么学校的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I could see Amos and Miles and Henry telling their group what had just happened. I knew they were talking about it because they kept looking over at me while they were talking. Even though the movie was still playing, people were whispering about it in the dark. News like that spreads fast.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我看到阿莫斯和亨利正在向他们小圈子里的人讲述刚刚发生的事情。我知道他们在谈论这件事，因为他们说话时一直看着我。虽然电影还在继续，但是黑暗中大家都在悄悄讨论这件事。这新闻不胫而走。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I wasn't planning on telling the teachers about any of what had happened, but they found out anyway. Maybe it was the torn sweatshirt and the bloody elbow. Or maybe it's just that teachers hear everything.</div>

<div class="line_en">When we got back to the camp, Mr. Tushman took me to the first-aid office, and while I was getting my elbow cleaned and bandaged up by the camp nurse, Mr. Tushman and the camp director were in the next room talking with Amos and Jack and Henry and Miles, trying to get a description of the troublemakers. When he asked me about them a little later, I said I couldn't remember their faces at all, which wasn't true.</div>

<div class="line_en">It's their faces I kept seeing every time I closed my eyes to sleep. The look of total horror on the girl's face when she first saw me. The way the kid with the flashlight, Eddie, looked at me as he talked to me, like he hated me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="每一次当我闭上眼睛快要入睡的时候我就会看见他们的脸。那女孩第一眼看见我时，脸上浮现的恐怖表情。那个叫埃迪的男生拿手电筒照着我，他跟我说话的时候盯着我的样子，好像对我恨之入骨。">查看中文翻译</div>
