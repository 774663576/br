<div class="line_en">For the few hours of daylight that were left they rested, shifting into the shade as the sun moved, until at last the shadow of the western rim of their dell grew long, and darkness filled all the hollow. Then they ate a little, and drank sparingly. Gollum ate nothing, but he accepted water gladly.</div>

<div class="line_en">The dusk was deep when at length they set out, creeping over the westward rim of the dell, and fading like ghosts into the broken country on the borders of the road. The moon was now three nights from the full, but it did not climb over the mountains until nearly midnight, and the early night was very dark. A single red light burned high up in the Towers of the Teeth, but otherwise no sign could be seen or heard of the sleepless watch on the Morannon.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当他们最后终于出发的时候，暮色已经相当深沉了，最后一丝的阳光偷偷摸摸地离开山谷中，像是鬼魂一般地悄悄离开了这块死寂的大地。月亮大概再过三天就要满月了，但紧接着黄昏的夜色依旧十分深沉。牙之塔上透露着一丝单薄的红光，但除此之外，魔多之门没有任何一丝一毫的动静。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Soon get more now," he said, licking his lips. "Good water runs down in streams to the Great River, nice water in the lands we are going to. Sméagol will get food there too, perhaps. He's very hungry, yes, gollum!" He set his two large flat hands on his shrunken belly, and a pale green light came into his eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“很快就可以多喝水了，”他舔着嘴唇说：“干净的水从大河流过来，我们要去的地方有好水，史麦戈也会在那边找到食物。他很饿了，真的，咕鲁！”他用一双大手抚摸着凹下去的肚子，眼睛闪起绿色的光芒。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The growing light revealed to them a land already less barren and ruinous. The mountains still loomed up ominously on their left, but near at hand they could see the southward road, now bearing away from the black roots of the hills and slanting westwards. Beyond it were slopes covered with sombre trees like dark clouds, but all about them lay a tumbled heathland, grown with ling and broom and cornel, and other shrubs that they did not know. Here and there they saw knots of tall pine-trees. The hearts of the hobbits rose again a little in spite of weariness: the air was fresh and fragrant, and it reminded them of the uplands of the Northfarthing far away. It seemed good to be reprieved, to walk in a land that had only been for a few years under the dominion of the Dark Lord and was not yet fallen wholly into decay. But they did not forget their danger, nor the Black Gate that was still all too near, hidden though it was behind the gloomy heights. They looked about for a hiding-place where they could shelter from evil eyes while the light lasted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="渐渐露出的晨光，让一块比较没有那么荒凉残破的大地显现在眼前。左方依旧是看来十分险恶的山脉，但他们可以清楚地看见眼前绕过山脚，微微向西方偏斜的道路。在道路之外则是长满了阴郁树林的斜坡，看起来像是被乌云笼罩一样，山坡上长满了石南、金雀花、山茱萸，和其它他们所不认识的灌木。除此之外，他们还可以看见四处生长着一丛丛高大的松树。哈比人虽然感到非常疲倦，但心情却轻松了起来：这里的空气清新、饱含着香气，让他们想到在遥远的故乡中夏尔北区的景象。对他们来说，能够走在一块只被黑暗魔君征服了几年，还没有被那股黑暗之气所腐化的大地上，实在是种享受。但他们并没有忘记自己依旧身在危险之中，也没有忘记魔多之门虽然被山脉所挡住，但还是位在极近之处。他们四下寻找可以在白天让他们躲过邪恶之眼搜索的藏身之处。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">With hearts strangely lightened they now rested again, but not for long. They were not going quick enough for Gollum. By his reckoning it was nearly thirty leagues from the Morannon to the Cross-roads above Osgiliath, and he hoped to cover that distance in four journeys. So soon they struggled on once more, until the dawn began to spread slowly in the wide grey solitude. They had then walked almost eight leagues, and the hobbits could not have gone any further, even if they had dared.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在感受到一股轻松的感觉之后，他们又再度找了个地方歇脚，但时间并不长，他们的速度对于咕鲁的期望来说并不够快。就他的估计，从魔多之门到奥斯吉力亚斯的十字路口大约有九十哩，他打算用四天赶到该处；因此很快的，他们又再度挣扎着起身，继续赶路，直到天色渐亮为止。他们那时几乎已经走了二十四哩，哈比人即使敢冒险，恐怕也已经走不动了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For many miles the red eye seemed to stare at them as they fled, stumbling through a barren stony country. They did not dare to take the road, but they kept it on their left, following its line as well as they could at a little distance. At last, when night was growing old and they were already weary, for they had taken only one short rest, the eye dwindled to a small fiery point and then vanished: they had turned the dark northern shoulder of the lower mountains and were heading southwards.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这只眼睛似乎一路注视着他们在荒凉的大地上跋涉，他们不敢冒险走大路，只是一直让它保持在众人的左边，同时保持着一段距离，避免迷失。最后，当夜已经渐渐深了，他们也觉得疲倦了的时候，那双眼睛才摇晃着消失在夜空中。他们已经绕过了山脉的北边山谷，正在往南方迈进中。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As soon as the land faded into a formless grey under coming night, they started out again. In a little while Gollum led them down on to the southward road; and after that they went on more quickly, though the danger was greater. Their ears were strained for the sound of hoof or foot on the road ahead, or following them from behind; but the night passed, and they heard no sound of walker or rider.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当大地在夜色之中化成一片灰暗之后，他们又继续开始前进。过不了多久，咕鲁就领着他们踏上了往南方的道路，在那之后，即使处境变得更危险，他们还是更快地赶路。他们的耳朵随时都要提防路边传来的风吹草动，可能是赶来的南方人或者是背后派来的追兵。但是，这一夜还是平平安安的过去了，没有任何异常之处。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The day passed uneasily. They lay deep in the heather and counted out the slow hours, in which there seemed little change; for they were still under the shadows of the Ephel Dúath, and the sun was veiled. Frodo slept at times, deeply and peacefully, either trusting Gollum or too tired to trouble about him; but Sam found it difficult to do more than doze, even when Gollum was plainly fast asleep, whiffling and twitching in his secret dreams. Hunger, perhaps, more than mistrust kept him wakeful: he had begun to long for a good homely meal, "something hot out of the pot".</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们觉得相当的不安，他们尽可能的将身体藏在树丛中，等待时间一分一秒的流逝。在他们眼中，一切似乎都慢得让人心焦，他们依旧还在伊菲尔杜斯的阴影之下，太阳也时时躲藏在云雾之中。佛罗多有时会陷入昏睡，不知道是因为十分相信咕鲁，还是因为太疲倦了，懒得担心这一切；不过，山姆就实在睡不着，即使连咕鲁都已经在睡梦中发出各种各样的怪声，他还是辗转反侧。饥饿或许比怀疑还要有效，让他一直睡不着，他开始很怀念家乡口味和正常的饮食，那些“热腾腾的，从锅子里面端出来的东西。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The road had been made in a long lost time, and for perhaps thirty miles below the Morannon it had been newly repaired, but as it went south the wild encroached upon it. The handiwork of Men of old could still be seen in its straight sure flight and level course: now and again it cut its way through hillside slopes, or leaped over a stream upon a wide shapely arch of enduring masonry; but at last all signs of stonework faded, save for a broken pillar here and there, peering out of bushes at the side, or old paving-stones still lurking amid weeds and moss. Heather and trees and bracken scrambled down and overhung the banks, or sprawled out over the surface. It dwindled at last to a country cart-road little used; but it did not wind: it held on its own sure course and guided them by the swiftest way.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="眼前的道路是在十分古远以前的时代所兴建的，大概在魔多之门以下三十哩左右，才是新修复的路段，不过，当它持续往南方前进的时候，荒野就开始和它争起主权来了。古代人类的成就依旧可以从平坦和直接的道路中看的出来，它偶尔会切过山脉的侧坡，或是藉由某个精致的拱桥跳过一段溪流。但是，到了最后，一切巧匠的痕迹都消失了，只有四处留下的破断石柱，从路边的树丛中探出头来，而古时铺路用的石板依旧在荒堙蔓草之间夹杂着。各种各样的植物生长在道路两侧，有时甚至会倒垂到路上来，到了最后，这条路变成了极少人烟的乡间小路，只不过，这条道路依旧直来直往，领着他们用最快速的方式穿越这块土地。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Day was opening in the sky, and they saw that the mountains were now much further off, receding eastward in a long curve that was lost in the distance. Before them, as they turned west, gentle slopes ran down into dim hazes far below. All about them were small woods of resinous trees, fir and cedar and cypress, and other kinds unknown in the Shire, with wide glades among them; and everywhere there was a wealth of sweet-smelling herbs and shrubs. The long journey from Rivendell had brought them far south of their own land, but not until now in this more sheltered region had the hobbits felt the change of clime. Here Spring was already busy about them: fronds pierced moss and mould, larches were green-fingered, small flowers were opening in the turf, birds were singing. Ithilien, the garden of Gondor now desolate kept still a dishevelled dryad loveliness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="天空渐渐变得光明，他们可以看见原先近逼的山脉现在距离越来越远，往东而去的一大半已经隐没在远方的云雾中。当众人转向西边的时候，可以看见和缓的斜坡直切入远方的迷蒙之中。现在，在他们四周全都是各种各样的树墓、有杉木、香柏木、柏树，和其它在夏尔没有出现过的植物，之间还有十分宽阔的草原，到处都可以看见发出甜美香气的药草和灌木。从瑞文戴尔出发的遥远旅程，让他们来到距离家乡极远的南方，但是，直到此地之时，他们才真正感受到气候的变化。在此地，春天已经开始忙碌起来，羊齿植物穿透了地面的许多苔藓，落叶松的顶端也冒出了绿色的新芽，小花在草原上开放，鸟儿歌唱着。伊西立安曾经是刚铎的花园，现在依旧勉强保持着让人怜爱的姿态。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So they passed into the northern marches of that land that Men once called Ithilien, a fair country of climbing woods and swift-falling streams. The night became fine under star and round moon, and it seemed to the hobbits that the fragrance of the air grew as they went forward; and from the blowing and muttering of Gollum it seemed that he noticed it too, and did not relish it. At the first signs of day they halted again. They had come to the end of a long cutting, deep, and sheer-sided in the middle, by which the road clove its way through a stony ridge. Now they climbed up the westward bank and looked abroad.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们就这样越过了人们曾经称作伊西立安的土地，原先是个长满了茂密植物和丰美溪流的地方。夜晚在圆月和星辰的照耀下变得十分舒适，在哈比人的感觉中，似乎他们越走，空气中的香气就变得越明显。从咕鲁不停嘀咕的的嘴里，似乎可以知道他也能感觉这种变化，而且并不觉得舒服。晨光一露出头，他们就立刻停了下来，他们来到了一条十分陡峭的地堑，道路沿着岩石的边缘切了过去，现在，他们沿着西边的路旁继续往前走。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">South and west it looked towards the warm lower vales of Anduin, shielded from the east by the Ephel Dúath and yet not under the mountain-shadow, protected from the north by the Emyn Muil, open to the southern airs and the moist winds from the Sea far away. Many great trees grew there, planted long ago, falling into untended age amid a riot of careless descendants; and groves and thickets there were of tamarisk and pungent terebinth, of olive and of bay; and there were junipers and myrtles; and thymes that grew in bushes, or with their woody creeping stems mantled in deep tapestries the hidden stones; sages of many kinds putting forth blue flowers, or red, or pale green; and marjorams and new-sprouting parsleys, and many herbs of forms and scents beyond the garden-lore of Sam. The grots and rocky walls were already starred with saxifrages and stonecrops. Primeroles and anemones were awake in the filbert-brakes; and asphodel and many lily-flowers nodded their half-opened heads in the grass: deep green grass beside the pools, where falling streams halted in cool hollows on their journey down to Anduin.</div>

<div class="line_en">The travellers turned their backs on the road and went downhill. As they walked, brushing their way through bush and herb, sweet odours rose about them. Gollum coughed and retched; but the hobbits breathed deep, and suddenly Sam laughed, for heart's ease not for jest. They followed a stream that went quickly down before them. Presently it brought them to a small clear lake in a shallow dell: it lay in the broken ruins of an ancient stone basin, the carven rim of which was almost wholly covered with mosses and rose-brambles; iris-swords stood in ranks about it, and water-lily leaves floated on its dark gently-rippling surface; but it was deep and fresh, and spilled ever softly out over a stony lip at the far end.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一行人背对着道路，走下山丘，随着他们拨开四周的各种药草，甜美的香气扑鼻而来。咕鲁又咳又吐，但哈比人们却欢欣鼓舞地深呼吸，突然间，山姆笑了，他觉得此时此刻再不笑就辜负了这个美好的环境。他们沿着一条小溪往前进，不久之后，这条小溪带着他们来到了一个浅谷中的池塘旁；池塘其实是一个古老的石盆所构成的凹陷，石盆的边缘几乎完全被青苔和蔷薇所覆盖，旁边则是生长着许多菖蒲，在它深沉、水波不兴的表面上飘浮着荷叶。不过，小池中的水却十分清澈，偶尔还会从盆缘溢流到旁边的草地上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Here they washed themselves and drank their fill at the in-falling freshet. Then they sought for a resting-place, and a hiding-place; for this land, fair-seeming still, was nonetheless now territory of the Enemy. They had not come very far from the road, and yet even in so short a space they had seen scars of the old wars, and the newer wounds made by the Orcs and other foul servants of the Dark Lord: a pit of uncovered filth and refuse; trees hewn down wantonly and left to die, with evil runes or the fell sign of the Eye cut in rude strokes on their bark.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们在这边梳洗一番，好好的把清水喝了个饱，然后，他们想找一个可以休息和躲藏的地方。因为虽然这块土地看来十分美丽，但依旧还是魔王的领土。他们并没有走离大路太远，即使在这里，他们都可以发现到古老战争的创痕，以及由半兽人和魔王其它的邪恶奴仆所造成的新破坏：一个装满了垃圾和排泄物的凹坑、随意砍伐的树木，树皮上面还刻着魔眼的标志。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A little way back above the lake they found a deep brown bed of last year's fern. Beyond it was a thicket of dark-leaved bay-trees climbing up a steep bank that was crowned with old cedars. Here they decided to rest and pass the day, which already promised to be bright and warm. A good day for strolling on their way along the groves and glades of Ithilien; but though Orcs may shun the sunlight, there were too many places here where they could lie hid and watch; and other evil eyes were abroad: Sauron had many servants. Gollum, in any case, would not move under the Yellow Face. Soon it would look over the dark ridges of the Ephel Dúath, and he would faint and cower in the light and heat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在距离池塘不远处的地方，他们找到了去年枯萎的羊齿植物所形成褐色软地，在那之后则是长满了深绿色叶子的月桂树，旁边围绕着香柏木的斜坡。他们决定在此休息，度过一个看来将会相当明亮、温暖的白天。这个天气适合在伊西立安的草地和森林中漫游，可惜的是，虽然半兽人讨厌阳光，但这里还是有太多他们可以躲藏、监视的地方了，而且，还有许多其它索伦的耳目混杂在此地；当然，就算没有其它的考量，咕鲁也不会愿意在大黄脸底下行动的。很快的，太阳就会越过伊菲尔杜斯的阴暗山脊，而他就会在那光明和高温下昏倒，趴在地上动弹不得。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sam scrambling below the outfall of the lake, smelling and touching the unfamiliar plants and trees, forgetful for the moment of Mordor, was reminded suddenly of their ever-present peril. He stumbled on a ring still scorched by fire, and in the midst of it he found a pile of charred and broken bones and skulls. The swift growth of the wild with briar and eglantine and trailing clematis was already drawing a veil over this place of dreadful feast and slaughter; but it was not ancient. He hurried back to his companions, but he said nothing: the bones were best left in peace and not pawed and routed by Gollum.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sam had been giving earnest thought to food as they marched. Now that the despair of the impassable Gate was behind him, he did not feel so inclined as his master to take no thought for their livelihood beyond the end of their errand; and anyway it seemed wiser to him to save the waybread of the Elves for worse times ahead. Six days or more had passed since he reckoned that they had only a bare supply for three weeks. "If we reach the Fire in that time, we'll be lucky at this rate!" he thought. "And we might be wanting to get back. We might!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山姆一路上想的都是食物，现在，在终于度过了那黑暗、绝望的大门之后，他并不准备像主人所说的一样，完全不思考完成任务之后的生活；反正，他还是觉得应该把精灵的干粮保留下来，留待日后状况更糟糕的时候再来救急。在他评估干粮仅够三周食用的那天算起，到现在又匆匆过了六天。“如果以这个速度来看，三周能够到达火山就算运气好了！”他想：“而且，我们还有可能会想要回来，真的有可能！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Besides, at the end of a long night-march, and after bathing and drinking, he felt even more hungry than usual. A supper, or a breakfast, by the fire in the old kitchen at Bagshot Row was what he really wanted. An idea struck him and he turned to Gollum. Gollum had just begun to sneak off on his own, and he was crawling away on all fours through the fern.</div>

<div class="line_en">Gollum disappeared. He was away some time, and Frodo after a few mouthfuls of lembas settled deep into the brown fern and went to sleep. Sam looked at him. The early daylight was only just creeping down into the shadows under the trees, but he saw his master's face very clearly, and his hands, too, lying at rest on the ground beside him. He was reminded suddenly of Frodo as he had lain, asleep in the house of Elrond, after his deadly wound. Then as he had kept watch Sam had noticed that at times a light seemed to be shining faintly within; but now the light was even clearer and stronger. Frodo's face was peaceful, the marks of fear and care had left it; but it looked old, old and beautiful, as if the chiselling of the shaping years was now revealed in many fine lines that had before been hidden, though the identity of the face was not changed. Not that Sam Gamgee put it that way to himself. He shook his head, as if finding words useless, and murmured: "I love him. He's like that, and sometimes it shines through, somehow. But I love him, whether or no."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Sméagol always helps," he said. "He has brought rabbits, nice rabbits. But master has gone to sleep, and perhaps Sam wants to sleep. Doesn't want rabbits now? Sméagol tries to help, but he can't catch things all in a minute."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“史麦戈乐意效劳，”他说：“他带来了小兔子，好兔子。但主人睡觉了，或许山姆也想睡觉。还想要兔子吗？史麦戈很想帮忙，但没办法一次抓到那么多东西。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Gollum returned quietly and peered over Sam's shoulder. Looking at Frodo, he shut his eyes and crawled away without a sound. Sam came to him a moment later and found him chewing something and muttering to himself. On the ground beside him lay two small rabbits, which he was beginning to eye greedily.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="咕鲁悄悄地溜了回来，从山姆背后无声无息地看着。他看着佛罗多，最后闭上眼，一声不出地走开来。山姆一段时间之后走到他身边，发现他正嚼着什么东西，一边自言自语。地面上则是两只小兔子，咕鲁的双眼一直贪婪地看着它们。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sam, however, had no objection to rabbit at all, and said so. At least not to cooked rabbit. All hobbits, of course, can cook, for they begin to learn the art before their letters (which many never reach); but Sam was a good cook, even by hobbit reckoning, and he had done a good deal of the camp-cooking on their travels, when there was a chance. He still hopefully carried some of his gear in his pack: a small tinder-box, two small shallow pans, the smaller fitting into the larger; inside them a wooden spoon, a short two-pronged fork and some skewers were stowed; and hidden at the bottom of the pack in a flat wooden box a dwindling treasure, some salt. But he needed a fire, and other things besides. He thought for a bit, while he took out his knife, cleaned and whetted it, and began to dress the rabbits. He was not going to leave Frodo alone asleep even for a few minutes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，山姆倒是一点也不反对吃兔子，他也清楚明白地告诉了史麦戈，至少煮熟的兔子没问题。所有的哈比人都会做菜，这门学问是在他们学会写字（有许多人很可能根本没时间学会这部分）之前，就开始研究的博大精深之道。不过，即使以哈比人的标准来看，山姆都可以算上一名好厨子，只要有机会，他就经常会在野外露一手他的厨艺。即使到了今天，他的背包中还是带着一部分的厨具：一个小的火绒盒、两个小平底锅，小锅正好可以装进大锅内，锅内则还有一柄木匙，一根短柄的双头叉以及几根备用的叉子。在背包的底部还藏着另一个小盒，里面是调味的无价宝藏：盐，但他还是需要火和一些其它的东西。他一边掏出刀子，磨利之后开始剥兔子皮，一边思索着这件事情。他不能够把熟睡的佛罗多就这么丢在这边，即使几分钟也不行。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">While Gollum was away Sam took another look at Frodo. He was still sleeping quietly, but Sam was now struck most by the leanness of his face and hands. "Too thin and drawn he is," he muttered. "Not right for a hobbit. If I can get these coneys cooked, I'm going to wake him up."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在咕鲁离开之后，山姆又看了佛罗多一眼。他依旧静静地睡着，但山姆突然间注意到他脸和手似乎都只剩下皮包骨而已。“他太瘦了，”他嘀咕着：“不像个哈比人，如果我可以把这些兔子煮好，我就把他叫起来。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sam gathered a pile of the driest fern, and then scrambled up the bank collecting a bundle of twigs and broken wood; the fallen branch of a cedar at the top gave him a good supply. He cut out some turves at the foot of the bank just outside the fern-brake, and made a shallow hole and laid his fuel in it. Being handy with flint and tinder he soon had a small blaze going. It made little or no smoke but gave off an aromatic scent. He was just stooping over his fire, shielding it and building it up with heavier wood, when Gollum returned, carrying the pans carefully and grumbling to himself. He set the pans down, and then suddenly saw what Sam was doing. He gave a thin hissing shriek, and seemed to be both frightened and angry. "Ach! Sss -- no!" he cried. "No! Silly hobbits, foolish, yes foolish! They mustn't do it!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山姆收集了一堆最干燥的蕨叶，又去附近找了一堆树枝和枯木，附近那株香柏木给了他不少柴火。他在离佛罗多不远的河岸旁挖了一个小洞，将所有的柴火都丢了进去。经过他的巧手拨弄之后，很快的升起了一小堆火，它只冒出淡淡的青烟，却有种浓郁的香味。他弯腰吹着小火，准备插进更大的树枝来将火弄旺些。咕鲁正好小心地捧着平底锅回来，一边自言自语的咕哝着，他把锅子放了下来，这才发现到山姆在做些什么。他低声惊呼，似乎又害怕又生气。“啊！嘶嘶──不要！”他大喊着：“不可以！笨哈比人，蠢哈比人，没错，蠢！他们绝对不可以这样做！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I don't think so," said Sam. "Don't see why it should, if you don't put wet stuff on it and make a smother. But if it does, it does. I'm going to risk it, anyhow. I'm going to stew these coneys."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不这么认为，”山姆说：“只要你不把湿的东西放上去，弄出浓烟来，我想它就不会引人注意。不过，就算它会冒烟，我也不在乎，我准备冒这个险──我要炖兔子！”">查看中文翻译</div>

They are young, they are tender, they are nice. Eat them, eat them!" He clawed at the nearest rabbit, already skinned and lying by the fire.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“炖兔子！”咕鲁垂头丧气地说：“糟蹋了史麦戈留给你的好肉，可怜的史麦戈肚子饿啊！为了什么？笨哈比人，为了什么？它们还小，肉很嫩、又很甜。吃掉它们，吃掉它们！”他用手戳着已经剥皮、靠近火边的兔尸。">查看中文翻译</div>

And I have. You needn't watch me. Go and catch another and eat it as you fancy -- somewhere private and out o' my sight.

<div class="line_en">Gollum withdrew grumbling, and crawled into the fern. Sam busied himself with his pans. "What a hobbit needs with coney," he said to himself, "is some herbs and roots, especially taters -- not to mention bread. Herbs we can manage, seemingly."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="咕鲁嘀咕着退了回去，钻进附近的森林中。山姆忙碌地搬弄着平底锅。“哈比人拿到兔子，”他自言自语道：“就是要拿香料和根茎类植物来配，特别是马铃薯，当然更别提面包了，看来我们应该可以变出一些香料来。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Gollum!" he called softly. "Third time pays for all. I want some herbs." Gollum's head peeped out of the fern, but his looks were neither helpful nor friendly. "A few bay-leaves, some thyme and sage, will do -- before the water boils," said Sam.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“咕鲁！”他轻声说：“第三次，也是最后一次麻烦你啦，我想要一些香料。”咕鲁从附近的森林中探出头来，看起来既不友善、也不太愿意帮忙。“几片月桂，一些百里香、几根鼠尾草就够了，请你在水滚之前找回来。”山姆说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No!" said Gollum. "Sméagol is not pleased. And Sméagol doesn't like smelly leaves. He doesn't eat grasses or roots, no precious, not till he's starving or very sick, poor Sméagol."</div>

<div class="line_en">In the end he had to find what he wanted for himself; but he did not have to go far, not out of sight of the place where his master lay, still sleeping. For a while Sam sat musing, and tending the fire till the water boiled. The daylight grew and the air became warm; the dew faded off turf and leaf. Soon the rabbits cut up lay simmering in their pans with the bunched herbs. Almost Sam fell asleep as the time went by. He let them stew for close on an hour, testing them now and again with his fork, and tasting the broth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到了最后，他还是得自己去找做菜要用的东西。但是他不需要走太远，至少不需要走到会看不见沉睡主人的地方。山姆坐着思考了片刻，一边等待水滚。天色越来越亮，四周也变得相当温暖，草地上的露珠也渐渐消退。很快的，切块剁好的兔子就在平底锅中噗噜噗噜地冒泡。山姆在等兔子肉炖熟的时候几乎睡着了，他炖了将近一小时，中间不停地用肉叉测试肉的熟度，并且尝尝汤汁的味道。">查看中文翻译</div>

I will: fried fish and chips served by S. Gamgee. You couldn't say no to that."</div>

Close by, just under the dappling shadow of the dark bay-trees, two men remained on guard.

They spoke together in soft voices, at first using the Common Speech, but after the manner of older days, and then changing to another language of their own. To his amazement, as he listened Frodo became aware that it was the elven-tongue that they spoke, or one but little different; and he looked at them with wonder, for he knew then that they must be Dúnedain of the South, men of the line of the Lords of Westernesse.</div>

With his keen hobbit-eyes he saw that many more Men were about. He could see them stealing up the slopes, singly or in long files, keeping always to the shade of grove or thicket, or crawling, hardly visible in their brown and green raiment, through grass and brake. All were hooded and masked, and had gauntlets on their hands, and were armed like Faramir and his companions. Before long they had all passed and vanished. The sun rose till it neared the South.

And they go ever more heedlessly, we learn, thinking that the power of their new master is great enough, so that the mere shadow of His hills will protect them. We come to teach them another lesson. Great strength of them was reported to us some days ago, marching north. One of their regiments is due by our reckoning to pass by, some time ere noon -- up on the road above, where it passes through the cloven way. The road may pass, but they shall not!

Suddenly the horns rang out louder and beyond mistake from above, over the top of the slope. Sam thought that he heard cries and wild shouting also, but the sound was faint, as if it came out of some distant cave. Then presently the noise of fighting broke out near at hand, just above their hiding-place.

<div class="line_en">Sam, eager to see more, went now and joined the guards. He scrambled a little way up into one of the larger of the bay-trees. For a moment he caught a glimpse of swarthy men in red running down the slope some way off with green-clad warriors leaping after them, hewing them down as they fled. Arrows were thick in the air. Then suddenly straight over the rim of their sheltering bank, a man fell, crashing through the slender trees, nearly on top of them. He came to rest in the fern a few feet away, face downward, green arrow-feathers sticking from his neck below a golden collar. His scarlet robes were tattered, his corslet of overlapping brazen plates was rent and hewn, his black plaits of hair braided with gold were drenched with blood. His brown hand still clutched the hilt of a broken sword.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山姆好奇地想要看得更仔细，于是跑到守卫们身边去，他爬上了一株月桂树上，想要看得更清楚些。他依稀看见有一大群肤色黝黑的人穿着红衣，沿着斜坡往下跑，穿着绿色衣服的人则紧追在后，毫不留情地砍杀落队的敌人，满天的箭雨更让那些红衣人损失惨重。突然间，有一个人从他们所躲藏的地方附近滚了进来，一路撞开小树，最后倒在羊齿植物中，差点撞上众人。他倒在地上，金色项圈底下的脖子上插了一支绿色的羽箭。他红色的袍子破烂不堪，身上层层的黄铜胸甲也弯折破碎，用黄金挽着的长发则沾满了鲜血，褐色的双手依旧紧抓着一柄破碎的长剑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was Sam's first view of a battle of Men against Men, and he did not like it much. He was glad that he could not see the dead face. He wondered what the man's name was and where he came from; and if he was really evil of heart, or what lies or threats had led him on the long march from his home; and if he would not really rather have stayed there in peace -- all in a flash of thought which was quickly driven from his mind. For just as Mablung stepped towards the fallen body, there was a new noise. Great crying and shouting. Amidst it Sam heard a shrill bellowing or trumpeting. And then a great thudding and bumping, like huge rams dinning on the ground.</div>

<div class="line_en">To his astonishment and terror, and lasting delight, Sam saw a vast shape crash out of the trees and come careering down the slope. Big as a house, much bigger than a house, it looked to him, a grey-clad moving hill. Fear and wonder, maybe, enlarged him in the hobbit's eyes, but the Mûmak of Harad was indeed a beast of vast bulk, and the like of him does not walk now in Middle-earth; his kin that live still in latter days are but memories of his girth and majesty. On he came, straight towards the watchers, and then swerved aside in the nick of time, passing only a few yards away, rocking the ground beneath their feet: his great legs like trees, enormous sail-like ears spread out, long snout upraised like a huge serpent about to strike, his small red eyes raging. His upturned hornlike tusks were bound with bands of gold and dripped with blood. His trappings of scarlet and gold flapped about him in wild tatters. The ruins of what seemed a very war-tower lay upon his heaving back, smashed in his furious passage through the woods; and high upon his neck still desperately clung a tiny figure -- the body of a mighty warrior, a giant among the Swertings.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山姆起初十分恐惧和惊讶，不过稍后这种情绪却转为兴奋，他看见一个巨大的形体撞穿树丛，沿着斜坡滑了下来；在他的眼中，那是一只比屋子还要大的怪物，是座会移动的灰色小山。或许，这是因为恐惧和惊奇，让它在哈比人的眼中放大了数倍，但哈拉德的姆马克的确是体型无比庞大的一种生物，今天中土世界中已经失去了它的踪迹，少数侥幸生存下来的远亲，则完全无法和它过去的尊荣和骄傲相提并论。它直接朝着旁观者冲过来，在千钧一发之际转了个弯，让他们脚下的大地为之震动。它巨大的腿如同树桩一样粗壮，像是风帆的耳朵不停地煽动，长长的鼻子高举，如同即将出击的蟒蛇一般，红色的双眼中闪动着怒火。它那双上扬的獠牙上有着黄金的环饰，同时还沾染着大量人类的血液，它身上原先披挂着的红色和金色的布幔都已经破烂不堪。它本来背上似乎搭载着一座高大的攻城塔，也在它凶暴的穿越森林时被撞个稀烂；在它的脖子上还挂着一个仓皇无助的人，他是黑人之中体型最高大的战士，相形之下却显得无比的渺小。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">On the great beast thundered, blundering in blind wrath through pool and thicket. Arrows skipped and snapped harmlessly about the triple hide of his flanks. Men of both sides fled before him, but many he overtook and crushed to the ground. Soon he was lost to view, still trumpeting and stamping far away. What became of him Sam never heard: whether he escaped to roam the wild for a time, until he perished far from his home or was trapped in some deep pit; or whether he raged on until he plunged in the Great River and was swallowed up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这只巨兽继续不停地往前冲，盲目冲过池塘和树丛，箭矢无力地从它厚重的皮肤上纷纷滚落下。两个阵营的战士都在它面前四散奔逃，许多依旧被它追上，在脚下踩成肉酱，很快的它就消失在众人面前，依旧嘶鸣着冲向远方。一直到很久以后，山姆都没有再听说过它的消息，不知道它是否在野外生活了一段时间，在远离家园的地方怡享天年；还是它被困在某个深坑中，或者是在狂怒中奔入大河中，从此不知所踪。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Sleep while you may," said Mablung. "But the Captain will return, if he is unhurt; and when he comes we shall depart swiftly. We shall be pursued as soon as news of our deed reaches the Enemy, and that will not be long."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“把握时机好好休息吧，”马伯龙说：“将军如果没受伤，不久之后就会回来的。在他回来之后，我们会很快出发的。只要这消息一被魔王知道，他马上会派兵来搜捕我们，而且这不会拖延太久的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sam drew a deep breath. "An Oliphaunt it was!" he said. "So there are Oliphaunts, and I have seen one. What a life! But no one at home will ever believe me. Well, if that's over, I'll have a bit of sleep."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山姆深吸一口气。“那就是我说的猛！”他说：“这世界上果然有猛，我今天就看到了一只。这真是让人兴奋！可惜，家乡的人永远不会相信我的。好吧，如果这一切结束了，我想要休息一下了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
