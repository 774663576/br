<div class="line_en">The drapes kept out the dust and heat of the streets, but they could not keep out disappointment. Dany climbed inside wearily, glad for the refuge from the sea of Qartheen eyes. "Make way," Jhogo shouted at the crowd from horseback, snapping his whip, "make way, make way for the Mother of Dragons."</div>

<div class="line_en">"A dream delayed, no more." Dany's tight silver collar was chafing against her throat. She unfastened it and flung it aside. The collar was set with an enchanted amethyst that Xaro swore would ward her against all poisons. The Pureborn were notorious for offering poisoned wine to those they thought dangerous, but they had not given Dany so much as a cup of water. They never saw me for a queen, she thought bitterly. I was only an afternoon's amusement, a horse girl with a curious pet.</div>

<div class="line_en">Rhaegal hissed and dug sharp black claws into her bare shoulder as Dany stretched out a hand for the wine. Wincing, she shifted him to her other shoulder, where he could claw her gown instead of her skin. She was garbed after the Qartheen fashion. Xaro had warned her that the Enthroned would never listen to a Dothraki, so she had taken care to go before them in flowing green samite with one breast bared, silvered sandals on her feet, with a belt of black-and-white pearls about her waist. For all the help they offered, I could have gone naked. Perhaps I should have. She drank deep.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当丹妮伸手去接葡萄酒时，雷哥发出嘶嘶的叫声，尖利的黑爪子嵌入她赤裸的肩膀。她只好缩手，并将它移到另一个肩膀，这样它就只能扒着衣服而不是皮肤。札罗警告过她，风雅的王族决不会听多斯拉克人说话，因此她按照魁尔斯风格穿着：一袭飘荡的绿绸缎，露出半边酥胸，脚套银色凉鞋，腰围黑白珍珠的腰带。早知这根本没用，我还不如光着身子去。也许我正该这么做。她喝了一大口酒。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Descendants of the ancient kings and queens of Qarth, the Pureborn commanded the Civic Guard and the fleet of ornate galleys that ruled the straits between the seas. Daenerys Targaryen had wanted that fleet, or part of it, and some of their soldiers as well. She made the traditional sacrifice in the Temple of Memory, offered the traditional bribe to the Keeper of the Long List, sent the traditional persimmon to the opener of the Door, and finally received the traditional blue silk slippers summoning her to the Hall of a Thousand Thrones.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Pureborn heard her pleas from the great wooden seats of their ancestors, rising in curved tiers from a marble floor to a high-domed ceiling painted with scenes of Qarth's vanished glory. The chairs were immense, fantastically carved, bright with goldwork and studded with amber, onyx, lapis, and jade, each one different from all the others, and each striving to be the most fabulous. Yet the men who sat in them seemed so listless and world-weary that they might have been asleep. They listened, but they did not hear, or care, she thought. They are Milk Men indeed. They never meant to help me. They came because they were curious. They came because they were bored, and the dragon on my shoulder interested them more than I did.</div>

<div class="line_en">She would have been lost without Xaro. The gold that she had squandered to open the doors of the Hall of a Thousand Thrones was largely a product of the merchant's generosity and quick wits. As the rumor of living dragons had spread through the east, ever more seekers had come to learn if the tale was true -- and Xaro Xhoan Daxos saw to it that the great and the humble alike offered some token to the Mother of Dragons.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没有札罗，丹妮早就不知所措了。她浪费在开启“千座之殿”大门上的钱财多半来自于商人的慷慨与机智。世间还有真龙这一消息传遍了东方，越来越多的寻龙者前来探访——札罗·赞旺·达梭斯规定大家不论尊卑，都得向龙之母献礼。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dany did not know where Faros was, but it seemed to her that Qarth was full of stone cows. The merchant princes, grown vastly rich off the trade between the seas, were divided into three jealous factions: the Ancient Guild of Spicers, the Tourmaline Brotherhood, and the Thirteen, to which Xaro belonged. Each vied with the others for dominance, and all three contended endlessly with the Pureborn. And brooding over all were the warlocks, with their blue lips and dread powers, seldom seen but much feared.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="丹妮不知法罗斯在哪里，但对她而言魁尔斯遍地都是石牛。凭借海外贸易发财致富的巨商们分为三个相互猜忌的派系：香料古公会，碧玺兄弟会，以及十三巨子，札罗属于后者。三个集团为了夺取贸易主导权而互相竞争，同时又和王族争斗不休。男巫们则在一旁虎视耽耽，他们有蓝色的嘴唇和可怕的力量，鲜少露面但令人敬畏。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The trickle he started soon swelled to a flood. Trader captains brought lace from Myr, chests of saffron from Yi Ti, amber and dragonglass out of Asshai. Merchants offered bags of coin, silversmiths rings and chains. Pipers piped for her, tumblers tumbled, and jugglers juggled, while dyers draped her in colors she had never known existed. A pair of Jogos Nhai presented her with one of their striped zorses, black and white and fierce. A widow brought the dried corpse of her husband, covered with a crust of silvered leaves; such remnants were believed to have great power, especially if the deceased had been a sorcerer, as this one had. And the Tourmaline Brotherhood pressed on her a crown wrought in the shape of a three-headed dragon; the coils were yellow gold, the wings silver, the heads carved from jade, ivory, and onyx.</div>

<div class="line_en">Yet even crowned, I am a beggar still, Dany thought. I have become the most splendid beggar in the world, but a beggar all the same. She hated it, as her brother must have. All those years of running from city to city one step ahead of the Usurper's knives, pleading for help from archons and princes and magisters, buying our food with flattery. He must have known how they mocked him. Small wonder he turned so angry and bitter. In the end it had driven him mad. It will do the same to me if I let it. Part of her would have liked nothing more than to lead her people back to Vaes Tolorro, and make the dead city bloom. No, that is defeat. I have something Viserys never had. I have the dragons. The dragons are all the difference.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="即便戴着王冠，我仍旧是个乞丐，丹妮心想，我是世间最为闪亮耀眼的乞丐，但终究是个乞丐。她痛恨这事实，想必哥哥当年也感同身受。他这么多年来，在篡夺者的杀手追杀下，从一座城市逃到另一座城市，一边向各位总督、大君和商界巨贾乞求援助，甚至靠谄媚奉承换取食物。他一定知道他们是如何瞧不起他，难怪会变得如此暴躁，如此难以亲近，最后终于被逼疯了。假如我放任自流，也会是这个下场。她内心的一部分只想带她的人民回到维斯·托罗若，重建那座死城。不，那等于失败。我有韦赛里斯所不具备的东西。我有龙。有了龙，一切皆已改变。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The crown was the only offering she'd kept. The rest she sold, to gather the wealth she had wasted on the Pureborn. Xaro would have sold the crown too -- the Thirteen would see that she had a much finer one, he swore -- but Dany forbade it. "Viserys sold my mother's crown, and men called him a beggar. I shall keep this one, so men will call me a queen." And so she did, though the weight of it made her neck ache.</div>

<div class="line_en">As Dany lifted her goblet to drink, Rhaegal sniffed at the wine and drew his head back, hissing. "Your dragon has a good nose." Xaro wiped his lips. "The wine is ordinary. It is said that across the jade Sea they make a golden vintage so fine that one sip makes all other wines taste like vinegar. Let us take my pleasure barge and go in search of it, you and I."</div>

<div class="line_en">She stroked Rhaegal. The green dragon closed his teeth around the meat of her hand and nipped hard. Outside, the great city murmured and thrummed and seethed, all its myriad voices blending into one low sound like the surge of the sea. "Make way, you Milk Men, make way for the Mother of Dragons," Jhogo cried, and the Qartheen moved aside, though perhaps the oxen had more to do with that than his voice. Through the swaying draperies, Dany caught glimpses of him astride his grey stallion. From time to time he gave one of the oxen a flick with the silver-handled whip she had given him. Aggo guarded on her other side, while Rakharo rode behind the procession, watching the faces in the crowd for any sign of danger. Ser Jorah she had left behind today, to guard her other dragons; the exile knight had been opposed to this folly from the start. He distrusts everyone, she reflected, and perhaps for good reason.</div>

<div class="line_en">"This Iron Throne you speak of sounds monstrous cold and hard. I cannot bear the thought of jagged barbs cutting your sweet skin."

While Ser Jorah had scarcely been able to keep his eyes from her bare breast when he'd helped her into the palanquin, Xaro hardly deigned to notice it, even in these close confines. And she had seen the beautiful boys who surrounded the merchant prince, flitting through his palace halls in wisps of silk. "You speak sweetly, Xaro, but under your words I hear another no."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Illyrio believes in no cause but Illyrio. Gluttons are greedy men as a rule, and magisters are devious. Illyrio Mopatis is both. What do you truly know of him?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“伊利里欧除了伊利里欧什么都不信。贪食必然贪婪，这是一条定律，而掌权者又总是生性狡猾。伊利里欧·莫帕提斯两样都占了。您真正了解他吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dany flushed. He had the truth of it, but she did not like the sharpness with which he put it. "Illyrio protected us from the Usurper's knives, and he believed in my brother's cause."</div>

<div class="line_en">That made her smile despite herself. "Oh, I have no doubt of that, ser. I know Illyrio better than you think. I was a child when I left his manse in Pentos to wed my sun-and-stars, but I was neither deaf nor blind. And I am no child now."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她情不自禁地笑了。“噢，这点我毫不怀疑，爵士。我对伊利里欧的了解比你想像的要多。当我离开他在潘托斯的宅邸，嫁给我的日和星时，的确还是个孩子，但我不聋也不瞎。而我现在也不再是孩子了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Sellswords have their uses," Ser Jorah admitted, "but you will not win your father's throne with sweepings from the Free Cities. Nothing knits a broken realm together so quick as an invading army on its soil."</div>

<div class="line_en">Drogon was curled up beneath her arm, as hot as a stone that has soaked all day in the blazing sun. Rhaegal and Viserion were fighting over a scrap of meat, buffeting each other with their wings as smoke hissed from their nostrils. My furious children, she thought. They must not come to harm. "The comet led me to Qarth for a reason. I had hoped to find my army here, but it seems that will not be. What else remains, I ask myself?" I am afraid, she realized, but I must be brave. "Come the morrow, you must go to Pyat Pree."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卓耿蜷缩在她的手臂下，像一块在烈日下暴晒整天的石头那么烫。雷哥和韦赛利昂正为了一块肉而争斗，用翅膀互相击打，烟雾嘶嘶地从鼻孔喷出。我桀骜不驯的孩子们，她心想，它们决不能受伤害。“彗星把我领到魁尔斯，必有其目的。我本希望在这里找到我的军队，但那似乎并不可能。我不禁自问，还会有什么呢？”我很恐惧，她意识到，但我必须勇敢。“明天，你去找俳雅·菩厉。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He ate an olive and spit out the pit into his palm. "I do not know, Your Grace," he admitted, "but I do know that the longer you remain in one place, the easier it will be for your enemies to find you. The name Targaryen still frightens them, so much so that they sent a man to murder you when they heard you were with child. What will they do when they learn of your dragons?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他吃下一颗橄榄，把果核吐到手心。“我不知道，陛下，”他承认。“但我知道您在一个地方待得越久，就越容易被敌人发现。坦格利安这个姓氏仍然让他们惧怕，以至于听说您怀了孩子，就派人来谋杀。如果他们得知您有了龙，又会怎么做呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You are a stranger who means to land on their shores with an army of outlanders who cannot even speak the Common Tongue. The lords of Westeros do not know you, and have every reason to fear and mistrust you. You must win them over before you sail. A few at least."</div>
