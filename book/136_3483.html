<div class="line_en">It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen. Winston Smith, his chin nuzzled into his breast in an effort to escape the vile wind, slipped quickly through the glass doors of Victory Mansions, though not quickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust from entering along with him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="四月的一天，晴朗而寒冷，时钟敲过十三下，温斯顿·史密斯缩着身子溜进胜利大厦的玻璃门，他动作迅速，却还是慢了一些，风吹起沙土跟着他钻进了屋。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The hallway smelt of boiled cabbage and old rag mats. At one end of it a coloured poster, too large for indoor display, had been tacked to the wall. It depicted simply an enormous face, more than a metre wide: the face of a man of about forty-five, with a heavy black moustache and ruggedly handsome features. Winston made for the stairs. It was no use trying the lift. Even at the best of times it was seldom working, and at present the electric current was cut off during daylight hours. It was part of the economy drive in preparation for Hate Week. The flat was seven flights up, and Winston, who was thirty-nine and had a varicose ulcer above his right ankle, went slowly, resting several times on the way. On each landing, opposite the lift-shaft, the poster with the enormous face gazed from the wall. It was one of those pictures which are so contrived that the eyes follow you about when you move. BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption beneath it ran.</div>

<div class="line_en">Inside the flat a fruity voice was reading out a list of figures which had something to do with the production of pig-iron. The voice came from an oblong metal plaque like a dulled mirror which formed part of the surface of the right-hand wall. Winston turned a switch and the voice sank somewhat, though the words were still distinguishable. The instrument (the telescreen, it was called) could be dimmed, but there was no way of shutting it off completely. He moved over to the window: a smallish, frail figure, the meagreness of his body merely emphasized by the blue overalls which were the uniform of the party. His hair was very fair, his face naturally sanguine, his skin roughened by coarse soap and blunt razor blades and the cold of the winter that had just ended.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="公寓里，一个洪亮的声音正在念着和钢铁生产有关的数字。声音来自镶嵌在右墙上的一块类似毛玻璃镜子的长方形金属板中。温斯顿把声音调低，这个装置（被称为电屏）只能将声音调低，不能完全关上。温斯顿走到窗前，蓝色的党员制服让他瘦小的身材看起来愈单薄。他的色很浅，面庞红润，皮肤因长期使用劣质肥皂和钝剃须刀变得粗糙。寒冷的冬天才刚刚结束。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Outside, even through the shut window-pane, the world looked cold. Down in the street little eddies of wind were whirling dust and torn paper into spirals, and though the sun was shining and the sky a harsh blue, there seemed to be no colour in anything, except the posters that were plastered everywhere. The black-moustachio'd face gazed down from every commanding corner. There was one on the house-front immediately opposite. BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption said, while the dark eyes looked deep into Winston's own. Down at street level another poster, torn at one corner, flapped fitfully in the wind, alternately covering and uncovering the single word INGSOC. In the far distance a helicopter skimmed down between the roofs, hovered for an instant like a bluebottle, and darted away again with a curving flight. It was the police patrol, snooping into people's windows. The patrols did not matter, however. Only the Thought Police mattered.</div>

<div class="line_en">Behind Winston's back the voice from the telescreen was still babbling away about pig-iron and the overfulfilment of the Ninth Three-Year Plan. The telescreen received and transmitted simultaneously. Any sound that Winston made, above the level of a very low whisper, would be picked up by it, moreover, so long as he remained within the field of vision which the metal plaque commanded, he could be seen as well as heard. There was of course no way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment. How often, or on what system, the Thought Police plugged in on any individual wire was guesswork. It was even conceivable that they watched everybody all the time. But at any rate they could plug in your wire whenever they wanted to. You had to live -- did live, from habit that became instinct -- in the assumption that every sound you made was overheard, and, except in darkness, every movement scrutinized.</div>

<div class="line_en">Winston kept his back turned to the telescreen. It was safer; though, as he well knew, even a back can be revealing. A kilometre away the Ministry of Truth, his place of work, towered vast and white above the grimy landscape. This, he thought with a sort of vague distaste -- this was London, chief city of Airstrip One, itself the third most populous of the provinces of Oceania. He tried to squeeze out some childhood memory that should tell him whether London had always been quite like this. Were there always these vistas of rotting nineteenth-century houses, their sides shored up with baulks of timber, their windows patched with cardboard and their roofs with corrugated iron, their crazy garden walls sagging in all directions? And the bombed sites where the plaster dust swirled in the air and the willow-herb straggled over the heaps of rubble; and the places where the bombs had cleared a larger patch and there had sprung up sordid colonies of wooden dwellings like chicken-houses? But it was no use, he could not remember: nothing remained of his childhood except a series of bright-lit tableaux occurring against no background and mostly unintelligible.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="温斯顿保持着背对电屏的姿势，这样相对安全。但他清楚，就算背对电屏仍有可能泄露信息。一公里外就是他工作的地方——真理部，那是一幢高大的白色建筑，高高地耸立在一片脏兮兮的区域内。这里，他有些厌恶地想着——这就是伦敦，大洋国第三人口大省一号空降带的主要城市。他努力在记忆中搜寻关于童年的蛛丝马迹，难道伦敦一直是这样吗？到处都是19世纪的破房子，墙的侧面靠木架子支撑，窗户上钉着硬纸板，屋顶上铺着皱巴巴的铁皮，就连花园的围墙也已经东倒西歪？还有那些经历了空袭的地方，灰尘飞舞，野花在残砖断瓦间生长，许多像鸡舍一样肮脏的木板房突然出现在爆炸后的空地上！但他的努力是徒劳的，他什么也想不起来，除了一片明亮的、背景难辨的、让人无法理解的画面，他的童年记忆里什么都没有。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Ministry of Truth -- Minitrue, in Newspeak [Newspeak was the official language of Oceania. For an account of its structure and etymology see Appendix.]-- was startlingly different from any other object in sight. It was an enormous pyramidal structure of glittering white concrete, soaring up, terrace after terrace, 300 metres into the air.

<div class="line_en">The Ministry of Truth contained, it was said, three thousand rooms above ground level, and corresponding ramifications below. Scattered about London there were just three other buildings of similar appearance and size. So completely did they dwarf the surrounding architecture that from the roof of Victory Mansions you could see all four of them simultaneously. They were the homes of the four Ministries between which the entire apparatus of government was divided. The Ministry of Truth, which concerned itself with news, entertainment, education, and the fine arts. The Ministry of Peace, which concerned itself with war. The Ministry of Love, which maintained law and order. And the Ministry of Plenty, which was responsible for economic affairs. Their names, in Newspeak: Minitrue, Minipax, Miniluv, and Miniplenty.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Ministry of Love was the really frightening one. There were no windows in it at all. Winston had never been inside the Ministry of Love, nor within half a kilometre of it. It was a place impossible to enter except on official business, and then only by penetrating through a maze of barbed-wire entanglements, steel doors, and hidden machine-gun nests. Even the streets leading up to its outer barriers were roamed by gorilla-faced guards in black uniforms, armed with jointed truncheons.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="真理部负责新闻、娱乐、教育、艺术；和平部负责战争；仁爱部负责法律和秩序；富足部负责经济。这四个部的名字若用新话来讲就是“真部”、“和部”、“爱部”和“富部”。其中，仁爱部是最令人战栗的一个，整幢大楼没有一扇窗户。温斯顿从来没有去过仁爱部，甚至不曾踏入距离它半公里的区域。这是一个非公莫入的地方，即使要进去，也要穿过遍布着铁丝网、设立着铁门和机关枪的道路。而在仁爱部外面的大街上，还有穿着黑色制服、带着警棍的警察，他们在街上巡逻，个个面目可怖。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Winston turned round abruptly. He had set his features into the expression of quiet optimism which it was advisable to wear when facing the telescreen. He crossed the room into the tiny kitchen. By leaving the Ministry at this time of day he had sacrificed his lunch in the canteen, and he was aware that there was no food in the kitchen except a hunk of dark-coloured bread which had got to be saved for tomorrow's breakfast. He took down from the shelf a bottle of colourless liquid with a plain white label marked VICTORY GIN. It gave off a sickly, oily smell, as of Chinese rice-spirit. Winston poured out nearly a teacupful, nerved himself for a shock, and gulped it down like a dose of medicine.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="温斯顿突然转过身来，换上一副心满意足的快乐表，这是面对电屏时的明智之举。他穿过房间来到小厨房。在这个时间离开真理部，他无法在食堂吃午饭。而他也清楚，他的厨房里只有一块要留到明天早上作早餐的黑面包。于是，他从架子上拿起一个贴着白色标签的瓶子，瓶子里装着无色的液体：胜利杜松子酒。这种酒散着令人恶心的汽油味，类似中国的白酒。温斯顿差不多倒了一茶杯，然后鼓足勇气，像喝药那样灌了下去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Instantly his face turned scarlet and the water ran out of his eyes. The stuff was like nitric acid, and moreover, in swallowing it one had the sensation of being hit on the back of the head with a rubber club. The next moment, however, the burning in his belly died down and the world began to look more cheerful. He took a cigarette from a crumpled packet marked VICTORY CIGARETTES and incautiously held it upright, whereupon the tobacco fell out on to the floor. With the next he was more successful. He went back to the living-room and sat down at a small table that stood to the left of the telescreen. From the table drawer he took out a penholder, a bottle of ink, and a thick, quarto-sized blank book with a red back and a marbled cover.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的脸立刻红了起来，泪水从眼角渗出。这东西的味道好像硝酸，喝的时候让人觉得后脑勺仿佛被橡皮棍狠狠地敲了一下。不过，过了一会儿，当胃里的灼烧感退去，世界看起来可爱多了。温斯顿从印有“胜利香烟”字样的小匣子中抽出一根烟，不小心将它拿竖了，烟丝掉到地上，他只好再抽出一根，这次成功了。他回到起居室，在电屏左边的小桌子前坐下，从抽屉里拿出一根笔杆、一瓶墨水和一个四开大小的空白本子。本子的封皮是红色的，上面还压有大理石花纹。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For some reason the telescreen in the living-room was in an unusual position. Instead of being placed, as was normal, in the end wall, where it could command the whole room, it was in the longer wall, opposite the window. To one side of it there was a shallow alcove in which Winston was now sitting, and which, when the flats were built, had probably been intended to hold bookshelves. By sitting in the alcove, and keeping well back, Winston was able to remain outside the range of the telescreen, so far as sight went. He could be heard, of course, but so long as he stayed in his present position he could not be seen. It was partly the unusual geography of the room that had suggested to him the thing that he was now about to do.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="通常电屏会被安装在房间最里面的墙上，方便监视整个房间，但不知为什么，温斯顿起居室的电屏却被装在了正对着窗户的较长的那面墙上。电屏的一边有个凹进去的地方，大概是建房子时计划留出来放书柜的，温斯顿就坐在这里，他尽可能地向后靠过去，让自己待在电屏的监视范围外。当然，他的声音还是可以被听到，但只要他待在现在这个位置，他就可以不被看到。这房子与众不同的格局让他想到了这点。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But it had also been suggested by the book that he had just taken out of the drawer. It was a peculiarly beautiful book. Its smooth creamy paper, a little yellowed by age, was of a kind that had not been manufactured for at least forty years past. He could guess, however, that the book was much older than that. He had seen it lying in the window of a frowsy little junk-shop in a slummy quarter of the town (just what quarter he did not now remember) and had been stricken immediately by an overwhelming desire to possess it. Party members were supposed not to go into ordinary shops ("dealing on the free market", it was called), but the rule was not strictly kept, because there were various things, such as shoelaces and razor blades, which it was impossible to get hold of in any other way. He had given a quick glance up and down the street and then had slipped inside and bought the book for two dollars fifty. At the time he was not conscious of wanting it for any particular purpose. He had carried it guiltily home in his briefcase. Even with nothing written in it, it was a compromising possession.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="而他之所以要这样做还和他刚刚拿出的那个本子有关。这是个漂亮的本子。纸质细致而光滑，由于年代久远的关系——这种纸至少有四十年没再生产了——纸张有些泛黄。但他猜测这本子的年代很可能比四十年还要长。他是在一间散着臭味的小旧货店的橱窗里看到它的。这家店就坐落在一个破败的街区里（他也记不清具体是哪个区）。看到它的第一眼，他就遏制不住要拥有它的欲望。虽然党员不允许进入普通商店（即“自由市场的买卖”），但这个规定并没有被严格执行，因为有太多东西，比如鞋带和刮胡刀的刀片，不到这里就无法买到。他迅速地向街道两旁看了几眼，然后钻到店里，花了两块五毛钱将它买下，他还没想到要拿它来做什么。他将它收在公文包里，怀着惴惴不安的心回了家，就算本子上一字未写，也可能引起怀疑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The thing that he was about to do was to open a diary. This was not illegal (nothing was illegal, since there were no longer any laws), but if detected it was reasonably certain that it would be punished by death, or at least by twenty-five years in a forced-labour camp. Winston fitted a nib into the penholder and sucked it to get the grease off. The pen was an archaic instrument, seldom used even for signatures, and he had procured one, furtively and with some difficulty, simply because of a feeling that the beautiful creamy paper deserved to be written on with a real nib instead of being scratched with an ink-pencil. Actually he was not used to writing by hand. Apart from very short notes, it was usual to dictate everything into the speak-write which was of course impossible for his present purpose. He dipped the pen into the ink and then faltered for just a second. A tremor had gone through his bowels. To mark the paper was the decisive act. In small clumsy letters he wrote:</div>

<div class="line_en">For some time he sat gazing stupidly at the paper. The telescreen had changed over to strident military music. It was curious that he seemed not merely to have lost the power of expressing himself, but even to have forgotten what it was that he had originally intended to say. For weeks past he had been making ready for this moment, and it had never crossed his mind that anything would be needed except courage. The actual writing would be easy. All he had to do was to transfer to paper the interminable restless monologue that had been running inside his head, literally for years. At this moment, however, even the monologue had dried up. Moreover his varicose ulcer had begun itching unbearably. He dared not scratch it, because if he did so it always became inflamed. The seconds were ticking by. He was conscious of nothing except the blankness of the page in front of him, the itching of the skin above his ankle, the blaring of the music, and a slight booziness caused by the gin.</div>

Audience much amused by shots of a great huge fat man trying to swim away with a helicopter after him, first you saw him wallowing along in the water like a porpoise, then you saw him through the helicopters gunsights, then he was full of holes and the sea round him turned pink and he sank as suddenly as though the holes had let in the water, audience shouting with laughter when he sank. then you saw a lifeboat full of children with a helicopter hovering over it. there was a middle-aged woman might have been a jewess sitting up in the bow with a little boy about three years old in her arms. little boy screaming with fright and hiding his head between her breasts as if he was trying to burrow right into her and the woman putting her arms round him and comforting him although she was blue with fright herself, all the time covering him up as much as possible as if she thought her arms could keep the bullets off him. then the helicopter planted a 20 kilo bomb in among them terrific flash and the boat went all to matchwood. then there was a wonderful shot of a child's arm going up up up right up into the air a helicopter with a camera in its nose must have followed it up and there was a lot of applause from the party seats but a woman down in the prole part of the house suddenly started kicking up a fuss and shouting they didnt oughter of showed it not in front of kids they didnt it aint right not in front of kids it aint until the police turned her turned her out i dont suppose anything happened to her nobody cares what the proles say typical prole reaction they never --</div>

<div class="line_en">Winston stopped writing, partly because he was suffering from cramp. He did not know what had made him pour out this stream of rubbish. But the curious thing was that while he was doing so a totally different memory had clarified itself in his mind, to the point where he almost felt equal to writing it down. It was, he now realized, because of this other incident that he had suddenly decided to come home and begin the diary today.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was nearly eleven hundred, and in the Records Department, where Winston worked, they were dragging the chairs out of the cubicles and grouping them in the centre of the hall opposite the big telescreen, in preparation for the Two Minutes Hate. Winston was just taking his place in one of the middle rows when two people whom he knew by sight, but had never spoken to, came unexpectedly into the room. One of them was a girl whom he often passed in the corridors. He did not know her name, but he knew that she worked in the Fiction Department. Presumably -- since he had sometimes seen her with oily hands and carrying a spanner -- she had some mechanical job on one of the novel-writing machines. She was a bold-looking girl, of about twenty-seven, with thick hair, a freckled face, and swift, athletic movements. A narrow scarlet sash, emblem of the Junior Anti-Sex League, was wound several times round the waist of her overalls, just tightly enough to bring out the shapeliness of her hips. Winston had disliked her from the very first moment of seeing her. He knew the reason. It was because of the atmosphere of hockey-fields and cold baths and community hikes and general clean-mindedness which she managed to carry about with her. He disliked nearly all women, and especially the young and pretty ones. It was always the women, and above all the young ones, who were the most bigoted adherents of the Party, the swallowers of slogans, the amateur spies and nosers-out of unorthodoxy. But this particular girl gave him the impression of being more dangerous than most. Once when they passed in the corridor she gave him a quick sidelong glance which seemed to pierce right into him and for a moment had filled him with black terror. The idea had even crossed his mind that she might be an agent of the Thought Police. That, it was true, was very unlikely. Still, he continued to feel a peculiar uneasiness, which had fear mixed up in it as well as hostility, whenever she was anywhere near him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="将近11点温斯顿工作的记录司为了给两分钟仇恨会做准备，大家纷纷将椅子从隔间里往外拉，直拉到大厅中央，正对着大型电屏。温斯顿刚要坐在中间一排的某个位置上，两个和他有点头之交的人出人意料地走了过来。其中一个是个女孩，经常和他在走廊里擦肩而过，他叫不出她的名字，只知道她可能在小说司工作，她经常满手油污地拿着扳手——她负责为某个正在写长篇小说的部长维修写作机。她看上去胆子很大，大约二十七岁，有着一头浓密的黑和长满雀斑的脸，她行动敏捷，就像运动员一样。她的腰间系着一条窄窄的鲜红色的饰带，那是青少年反性同盟的标志，饰带在她的工作服上绕了几圈，缠得刚刚好，巧妙地衬托出她臀部的线条。第一眼看到她，温斯顿就心生厌恶，他知道这是为什么。因为他努力制造出类似曲棍球场、冷水浴、集体远足那样排除杂念的氛围。几乎所有女人他都厌恶，特别是年轻貌美的。女人，尤其是年轻女人，总是盲目地追随着党，她们不假思索地接受党的口号，无偿地侦察那些异端思想。他觉得这个女孩比别的女人更加危险。一次，他们在走廊里相遇，她斜着眼睛迅速地打量了他一番，那眼神仿佛刺透了他的身体，瞬间将黑色的恐惧注入其中。他闪过一个念头：或许，她是思想警察。尽管这种可能性很小，接近她，仍会让他不舒服，而这不适感既包含敌意也包含恐惧。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The other person was a man named O'Brien, a member of the Inner Party and holder of some post so important and remote that Winston had only a dim idea of its nature. A momentary hush passed over the group of people round the chairs as they saw the black overalls of an Inner Party member approaching. O'Brien was a large, burly man with a thick neck and a coarse, humorous, brutal face. In spite of his formidable appearance he had a certain charm of manner. He had a trick of resettling his spectacles on his nose which was curiously disarming -- in some indefinable way, curiously civilized. It was a gesture which, if anyone had still thought in such terms, might have recalled an eighteenth-century nobleman offering his snuffbox. Winston had seen O'Brien perhaps a dozen times in almost as many years. He felt deeply drawn to him, and not solely because he was intrigued by the contrast between O'Brien's urbane manner and his prize-fighter's physique. Much more it was because of a secretly held belief -- or perhaps not even a belief, merely a hope -- that O'Brien's political orthodoxy was not perfect. Something in his face suggested it irresistibly. And again, perhaps it was not even unorthodoxy that was written in his face, but simply intelligence. But at any rate he had the appearance of being a person that you could talk to if somehow you could cheat the telescreen and get him alone. Winston had never made the smallest effort to verify this guess: indeed, there was no way of doing so. At this moment O'Brien glanced at his wrist-watch, saw that it was nearly eleven hundred, and evidently decided to stay in the Records Department until the Two Minutes Hate was over. He took a chair in the same row as Winston, a couple of places away. A small, sandy-haired woman who worked in the next cubicle to Winston was between them. The girl with dark hair was sitting immediately behind.</div>

<div class="line_en">As usual, the face of Emmanuel Goldstein, the Enemy of the People, had flashed on to the screen. There were hisses here and there among the audience. The little sandy-haired woman gave a squeak of mingled fear and disgust. Goldstein was the renegade and backslider who once, long ago (how long ago, nobody quite remembered), had been one of the leading figures of the Party, almost on a level with Big Brother himself, and then had engaged in counter-revolutionary activities, had been condemned to death, and had mysteriously escaped and disappeared. The programmes of the Two Minutes Hate varied from day to day, but there was none in which Goldstein was not the principal figure. He was the primal traitor, the earliest defiler of the Party's purity. All subsequent crimes against the Party, all treacheries, acts of sabotage, heresies, deviations, sprang directly out of his teaching. Somewhere or other he was still alive and hatching his conspiracies: perhaps somewhere beyond the sea, under the protection of his foreign paymasters, perhaps even -- so it was occasionally rumoured -- in some hiding-place in Oceania itself.</div>

<div class="line_en">Winston's diaphragm was constricted. He could never see the face of Goldstein without a painful mixture of emotions. It was a lean Jewish face, with a great fuzzy aureole of white hair and a small goatee beard -- a clever face, and yet somehow inherently despicable, with a kind of senile silliness in the long thin nose, near the end of which a pair of spectacles was perched. It resembled the face of a sheep, and the voice, too, had a sheep-like quality. Goldstein was delivering his usual venomous attack upon the doctrines of the Party -- an attack so exaggerated and perverse that a child should have been able to see through it, and yet just plausible enough to fill one with an alarmed feeling that other people, less level-headed than oneself, might be taken in by it. He was abusing Big Brother, he was denouncing the dictatorship of the Party, he was demanding the immediate conclusion of peace with Eurasia, he was advocating freedom of speech, freedom of the Press, freedom of assembly, freedom of thought, he was crying hysterically that the revolution had been betrayed -- and all this in rapid polysyllabic speech which was a sort of parody of the habitual style of the orators of the Party, and even contained Newspeak words: more Newspeak words, indeed, than any Party member would normally use in real life. And all the while, lest one should be in any doubt as to the reality which Goldstein's specious claptrap covered, behind his head on the telescreen there marched the endless columns of the Eurasian army -- row after row of solid-looking men with expressionless Asiatic faces, who swam up to the surface of the screen and vanished, to be replaced by others exactly similar. The dull rhythmic tramp of the soldiers' boots formed the background to Goldstein's bleating voice.</div>

<div class="line_en">Before the Hate had proceeded for thirty seconds, uncontrollable exclamations of rage were breaking out from half the people in the room. The self-satisfied sheep-like face on the screen, and the terrifying power of the Eurasian army behind it, were too much to be borne: besides, the sight or even the thought of Goldstein produced fear and anger automatically. He was an object of hatred more constant than either Eurasia or Eastasia, since when Oceania was at war with one of these Powers it was generally at peace with the other. But what was strange was that although Goldstein was hated and despised by everybody, although every day and a thousand times a day, on platforms, on the telescreen, in newspapers, in books, his theories were refuted, smashed, ridiculed, held up to the general gaze for the pitiful rubbish that they were -- in spite of all this, his influence never seemed to grow less. Always there were fresh dupes waiting to be seduced by him. A day never passed when spies and saboteurs acting under his directions were not unmasked by the Thought Police. He was the commander of a vast shadowy army, an underground network of conspirators dedicated to the overthrow of the State. The Brotherhood, its name was supposed to be. There were also whispered stories of a terrible book, a compendium of all the heresies, of which Goldstein was the author and which circulated clandestinely here and there. It was a book without a title. People referred to it, if at all, simply as THE BOOK. But one knew of such things only through vague rumours. Neither the Brotherhood nor THE BOOK was a subject that any ordinary Party member would mention if there was a way of avoiding it.</div>

<div class="line_en">In its second minute the Hate rose to a frenzy. People were leaping up and down in their places and shouting at the tops of their voices in an effort to drown the maddening bleating voice that came from the screen. The little sandy-haired woman had turned bright pink, and her mouth was opening and shutting like that of a landed fish. Even O'Brien's heavy face was flushed. He was sitting very straight in his chair, his powerful chest swelling and quivering as though he were standing up to the assault of a wave. The dark-haired girl behind Winston had begun crying out 'Swine! Swine! Swine!' and suddenly she picked up a heavy Newspeak dictionary and flung it at the screen. It struck Goldstein's nose and bounced off; the voice continued inexorably. In a lucid moment Winston found that he was shouting with the others and kicking his heel violently against the rung of his chair. The horrible thing about the Two Minutes Hate was not that one was obliged to act a part, but, on the contrary, that it was impossible to avoid joining in. Within thirty seconds any pretence was always unnecessary. A hideous ecstasy of fear and vindictiveness, a desire to kill, to torture, to smash faces in with a sledge-hammer, seemed to flow through the whole group of people like an electric current, turning one even against one's will into a grimacing, screaming lunatic. And yet the rage that one felt was an abstract, undirected emotion which could be switched from one object to another like the flame of a blowlamp. Thus, at one moment Winston's hatred was not turned against Goldstein at all, but, on the contrary, against Big Brother, the Party, and the Thought Police; and at such moments his heart went out to the lonely, derided heretic on the screen, sole guardian of truth and sanity in a world of lies. And yet the very next instant he was at one with the people about him, and all that was said of Goldstein seemed to him to be true. At those moments his secret loathing of Big Brother changed into adoration, and Big Brother seemed to tower up, an invincible, fearless protector, standing like a rock against the hordes of Asia, and Goldstein, in spite of his isolation, his helplessness, and the doubt that hung about his very existence, seemed like some sinister enchanter, capable by the mere power of his voice of wrecking the structure of civilization.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was even possible, at moments, to switch one's hatred this way or that by a voluntary act. Suddenly, by the sort of violent effort with which one wrenches one's head away from the pillow in a nightmare, Winston succeeded in transferring his hatred from the face on the screen to the dark-haired girl behind him. Vivid, beautiful hallucinations flashed through his mind. He would flog her to death with a rubber truncheon. He would tie her naked to a stake and shoot her full of arrows like Saint Sebastian. He would ravish her and cut her throat at the moment of climax. Better than before, moreover, he realized WHY it was that he hated her. He hated her because she was young and pretty and sexless, because he wanted to go to bed with her and would never do so, because round her sweet supple waist, which seemed to ask you to encircle it with your arm, there was only the odious scarlet sash, aggressive symbol of chastity.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Hate rose to its climax. The voice of Goldstein had become an actual sheep's bleat, and for an instant the face changed into that of a sheep. Then the sheep-face melted into the figure of a Eurasian soldier who seemed to be advancing, huge and terrible, his sub-machine gun roaring, and seeming to spring out of the surface of the screen, so that some of the people in the front row actually flinched backwards in their seats. But in the same moment, drawing a deep sigh of relief from everybody, the hostile figure melted into the face of Big Brother, black-haired, black-moustachio'd, full of power and mysterious calm, and so vast that it almost filled up the screen. Nobody heard what Big Brother was saying. It was merely a few words of encouragement, the sort of words that are uttered in the din of battle, not distinguishable individually but restoring confidence by the fact of being spoken. Then the face of Big Brother faded away again, and instead the three slogans of the Party stood out in bold capitals:</div>

<div class="line_en">At this moment the entire group of people broke into a deep, slow, rhythmical chant of "B-B!…B-B!"-- over and over again, very slowly, with a long pause between the first "B" and the second -- a heavy, murmurous sound, somehow curiously savage, in the background of which one seemed to hear the stamp of naked feet and the throbbing of tom-toms. For perhaps as much as thirty seconds they kept it up. It was a refrain that was often heard in moments of overwhelming emotion. Partly it was a sort of hymn to the wisdom and majesty of Big Brother, but still more it was an act of self-hypnosis, a deliberate drowning of consciousness by means of rhythmic noise. Winston's entrails seemed to grow cold. In the Two Minutes Hate he could not help sharing in the general delirium, but this sub-human chanting of "B-B!…B-B!" always filled him with horror. Of course he chanted with the rest: it was impossible to do otherwise. To dissemble your feelings, to control your face, to do what everyone else was doing, was an instinctive reaction. But there was a space of a couple of seconds during which the expression of his eyes might conceivably have betrayed him. And it was exactly at this moment that the significant thing happened -- if, indeed, it did happen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时，所有在场者都慢慢地、有节奏地、一遍又一遍地用低沉的声音喊着：“b—b！……b—b！”他们喊得很慢，第一个b和第二个b之间有长长的间隔。这低沉又模糊的声音很奇怪地带着野蛮的气息。在这样的背景下，人好像听到了赤脚踩地的声音和咚咚的鼓声。喊叫大约持续了30秒。在那些绪盖过理智的时刻，人们常可以听到这样的叫声。在某种程度上，它是对老大哥英明和权威的赞颂，但更多的，它是一种自我催眠，人们故意用有节奏的声音来麻痹自己的意识。温斯顿由内而外地感到寒冷。两分钟仇恨会上，他无法控制住自己，他和大家一起陷入狂热。这非人的叫喊声“b—b！……b—b！”让他惊恐。当然，他也和大家一起呼喊，他不可能不这么做。这是人的本能：隐藏自己的真实感，控制自己的表，别人怎么做你就怎么做。但有那么几秒钟，他的眼神可能出卖了他，就在这一刻，颇具意义的事生了——如果它的确生过。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Momentarily he caught O'Brien's eye. O'Brien had stood up. He had taken off his spectacles and was in the act of resettling them on his nose with his characteristic gesture. But there was a fraction of a second when their eyes met, and for as long as it took to happen Winston knew -- yes, he KNEW!-- that O'Brien was thinking the same thing as himself. An unmistakable message had passed. It was as though their two minds had opened and the thoughts were flowing from one into the other through their eyes. "I am with you," O'Brien seemed to be saying to him. "I know precisely what you are feeling. I know all about your contempt, your hatred, your disgust. But don't worry, I am on your side!" And then the flash of intelligence was gone, and O'Brien's face was as inscrutable as everybody else's.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那一瞬间，他捕捉到奥布兰的目光。当时奥布兰站着，正准备用他特有的姿势将之前摘下的眼镜戴上。就在他们四目相交的不到一秒的时间里，温斯顿明白了——是的，他明白！——奥布兰和自己正思考着相同的事。一个不容置疑的信息传递过来，就好像两个人的大脑都敞开，彼此的思想借助目光传递到对方那里。“我和你一样，”奥布兰似乎在对着他说。“我完全清楚你的感受，我知道你蔑视什么、仇恨什么、厌恶什么，但别担心，我站在你这边。”之后这心意相通的时刻过去，奥布兰的表又变得和其他人一样深不可测。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That was all, and he was already uncertain whether it had happened. Such incidents never had any sequel. All that they did was to keep alive in him the belief, or hope, that others besides himself were the enemies of the Party. Perhaps the rumours of vast underground conspiracies were true after all -- perhaps the Brotherhood really existed! It was impossible, in spite of the endless arrests and confessions and executions, to be sure that the Brotherhood was not simply a myth. Some days he believed in it, some days not. There was no evidence, only fleeting glimpses that might mean anything or nothing: snatches of overheard conversation, faint scribbles on lavatory walls -- once, even, when two strangers met, a small movement of the hand which had looked as though it might be a signal of recognition. It was all guesswork: very likely he had imagined everything. He had gone back to his cubicle without looking at O'Brien again. The idea of following up their momentary contact hardly crossed his mind. It would have been inconceivably dangerous even if he had known how to set about doing it. For a second, two seconds, they had exchanged an equivocal glance, and that was the end of the story. But even that was a memorable event, in the locked loneliness in which one had to live.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="过程就是这样，温斯顿开始怀疑事是否真的生过。这样的事不会有后续，所有这些只不过让他保持信念、怀抱希望——除了他自己，还有人是党的敌人。也许关于庞大的地下网络的传是真的，也许兄弟会真的存在。尽管诸如逮捕、招供、处决类的事一直在生，但人们仍然没法确定兄弟会存在，有时温斯顿觉得它有，有时又觉得没有。没有任何证据，除了那些捕风捉影的东西，它们可能谕示着什么，也可能什么都不是：无意中听到的谈话，厕所墙上胡乱涂写的模糊语句，甚至陌生人相遇时所做的也许是“暗号”的小动作。统统这些全是猜测，很有可能都出自他的臆想。他又回到他的隔间去，没有再看到奥布兰。他几乎没想过继续和奥布兰那样接触。这太危险了，就算他知道怎样做，他也不能去做。他们只不过在一两秒的时间里混混沌沌地交换了目光，这就是事的全部。而即便如此，对生活在自我隔绝中的孤独的人来说，它依然值得铭记。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was always at night -- the arrests invariably happened at night. The sudden jerk out of sleep, the rough hand shaking your shoulder, the lights glaring in your eyes, the ring of hard faces round the bed. In the vast majority of cases there was no trial, no report of the arrest. People simply disappeared, always during the night.
