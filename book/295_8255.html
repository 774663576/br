<div class="line_en">Pacing the terminal for hours, he wandered past shops that had long since closed up for the evening, stopping only occasionally to look through the barricades that kept nighttime travelers at bay.</div>

<div class="line_en">Not knowing where else to go, Garrett caught a cab to the airport after leaving  Theresa's apartment. Unfortunately no flights were available, and he ended up staying in the terminal the rest of the night, still angry and unable to sleep.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The following morning he caught the first flight he could and made it home a little after eleven and then went straight to his room. As he lay in bed, however, the events of the evening before kept running through his head, keeping him awake. Trying and failing to fall asleep, he eventually gave up. He showered and dressed, then sat on his bed again. Staring at the photograph of Catherine, he eventually picked it up and carried it with him into the living room. On the coffee table he found the letters where he'd left them. In Theresa's apartment he'd been too shocked to make sense of them, but now, with her picture in front of him, he read the letters slowly, almost reverently, sensing Catherine's presence filling the room.</div>

<div class="line_en">Smiling, Catherine took his hand as she stepped on board. "I didn't forget, I just had a little detour on the way."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She nodded. "I think I must have gotten pregnant the last time we went sailing."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Catherine closed her eyes and whispered in his ear, "And you're going to be a father."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I saw your truck out front. I wanted to make sure everything was okay," he said in explanation. "I didn't expect you back here until this evening." When Garrett didn't respond, his father walked in and immediately spotted Catherine's picture on the table. "You okay, son?" he asked cautiously.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Eight weeks?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Garrett's thoughts were interrupted by the squeaking of the door. His father peeked his head into the room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Uh-huh. I'm officially eight weeks along."</div>

<div class="line_en">They sat in the living room while Garrett explained the situation from the beginning-the dreams he'd been having over the years, the messages he'd been sending by bottle, finally moving on to the argument they'd had the night before. He left nothing out. When he finished, his father took the letters from Garrett's hand.</div>

<div class="line_en">"No, she didn't," he said gently. "She may have come down to meet you, but she didn't make you fall in love with her. You did that on your own."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Garrett looked away before finally returning his gaze to the picture on the table. "But don't you think it was wrong of her to hide it from me?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It must have been quite a shock," he said, glancing at the pages, surprised that Garrett had never mentioned the letters to him. He paused. "But don't you think you were a little rough on her?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Garrett shook his head tiredly. "She knew everything about me, Dad, and she never told me. She set the whole thing up."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Why has that changed?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Garrett nodded absently.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jeb sighed, not wanting to answer the question, knowing it would lead Garrett to retread old ground. Instead he tried to think of another way to get through to his son. "A couple of weeks ago, when we were talking on the pier, you told me you wanted to marry Theresa because you loved her. Do you remember that?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Garrett looked at his father, confused. "I've already told you that --"</div>

</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yeah, you've explained your reasons, but you haven't been honest about it. Not with me, not with Theresa, not even with yourself. She may not have told you about the letters, and granted, maybe she should have. But that's not why you're still angry now. You're angry because she made you realize something that you didn't want to admit."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As Garrett muttered and cursed in the kitchen, Jeb stared at the picture of Catherine, remembering his own wife from long ago. He put the letters beside it and walked to the sliding glass door. Opening it, he watched as cold December winds from the Atlantic made the waves crash violently, the sounds echoing through the house. Jeb contemplated the ocean, watching it churn and roll until he heard a knock at the door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jeb gently cut him off before he could finish.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Garrett looked at his father without responding. Then, rising from the couch, he went to the kitchen, suddenly feeling the urge to escape the conversation. In the refrigerator, he found a pitcher of sweet tea and poured himself a glass.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Holding the freezer open, he pulled out the metal tray to crack out a couple of cubes. In a sudden spurt of frustration, he pulled the lever too hard and icecubes flew over the counter and onto the floor.</div>

<div class="line_en">He turned, wondering who it could be. Strangely, he realized that in all of his visits here, no one had ever come to the door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the kitchen, Garrett apparently hadn't heard the knock. Jeb went to answer it. Behind him, the wind chimes hanging over the back deck were ringing loudly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When the front door swung open, wind gusted through the living room, scattering the letters to the floor. Jeb, however, didn't notice. All his attention was focused on the visitor on the porch. He couldn't help but stare.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Standing before him was a dark-haired young woman he'd never seen before. He paused in the doorway, knowing exactly who she was but finding himself at a loss for words. He moved aside to make room for her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Coming," he called out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You must be Theresa," Jeb finally said. In the background, Jeb could hear Garrett mumbling to himself as he cleaned up the ice in the kitchen.</div>

<div class="line_en">"C'mon in," he said quietly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As she entered, closing the door behind her, the wind abruptly died. She glanced at Jeb, uncomfortable. For a moment, neither spoke.</div>

<div class="line_en">Theresa nodded, suddenly wondering whether coming down was a good idea. She glanced around the room and immediately spied the letters spread around the floor. She also noticed Garrett's bag sitting by his bedroom door, still packed from his visit. Other than that, the house looked exactly the same as it always did. Except, of course, for the photograph.</div>

<div class="line_en">"How is he?"</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She spotted it over Jeb's shoulder. Normally it was in his room, and for some reason, now that it was in plain view, she couldn't take her eyes off it. She was still staring at the picture when Garrett reentered the living room.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He went to the front door, glancing sidelong at Theresa. "It was nice meeting you," he murmured. But as he spoke, he raised his eyebrows and shrugged slightly, as if to wish her luck. In a moment he was outside, making his way down the walk.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You two have a lot to talk about, so I'll get out of here."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Why?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Instead she wrapped her arms around him. Reluctantly he drew his arms around her as she rested her head against him. She kissed his neck and pulled him closer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She didn't answer. Instead, after a moment's hesitation, she walked toward him, her eyes never leaving his. Once she was close, she put her finger to his lips and shook her head to stop him from speaking. "Shh," she whispered, "no questions… just for now. Please…" She tried to smile, but now that he could see her better, he knew she'd been crying.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Running her hand through his hair, she moved her mouth tentatively to his cheek, then to his lips. She kissed them lightly at first, her lips barely brushing against them, then she kissed him again, more passionate now. Without conscious thought, he began to respond to her advances. His hands slowly traveled up her back, molding her against him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the living room, with the roar of the ocean echoing through the house, they held each other tightly, giving in to their growing desires. Finally Theresa pulled back, reaching for his hand as she did so. Taking it in hers, she led him to the bedroom.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Letting go, she crossed the room as he waited just inside the door. Light from the living room spilled in, casting shadows across the room. Hesitating only slightly before facing him again, she began to undress. Garrett made a small movement to close the bedroom door, but she shook her head. She wanted to see him this time, and she wanted him to see her. She wanted Garrett to know he was with her and no one else.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Slowly, ever so slowly, she shed her garments. Her blouse… her jeans… her bra… her panties. She removed her clothing deliberately, her lips slightly parted, her eyes never leaving his. When she was naked, she stood before him, letting his gaze travel over all of her.</div>

<div class="line_en">They made love fiercely, clinging desperately to each other. Their passion was unlike any time they'd made love before-each painfully conscious of the other's pleasure, every touch more electric than the last. As if fearful of what the future would bring, they worshiped each other's bodies with a singleminded intensity that would sear their memories forever. When they finally climaxed together, Theresa threw back her head and cried aloud, not attempting to stifle the sound.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Moving to his side, she kissed his shoulders, then slowly worked around him, her mouth against his skin, the wetness of her lips lingering everywhere she touched. Then, leading him to the bed, she lay down, pulling him with her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Finally she approached him. Standing close, she ran her hands over him-his chest, his shoulders, his arms, touching him gently, as if she wanted to remember the way he felt forever.

<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Afterward she sat up in the bed, cradling Garrett's head in her lap. She ran her hands through his hair, rhythmically, steadily, listening as the sound of his breathing gradually deepened.</div>

<div class="line_en">Garrett-not just one but three-and every one of them touched me the same way the first one had. So, with Deanna's help, I found out who you were and I came down to meet you."</div>

<div class="line_en">His expression as he looked at her cut through all her defenses, her fragile resolve. For just a moment she wanted to take everything back.

<div class="line_en">Knowing she would start to cry again if she stayed any longer, she rolled up the window. Looking over her shoulder, she began to back out of the drive.

Garrett kept running behind the car, chasing it as it made its way down the street. He watched as the car moved farther into the distance, becoming smaller with each passing moment. His lungs burned, but he kept on going, racing a sense of futility. The rain began to come down in sheets, storm drops, soaking through his shirt and making it difficult for him to see.</div>

<div class="line_en">Finally he slowed to a jog, then stopped. The air was dense with rain, and he was breathing heavily. His shirt clung to his skin, his hair hanging in his eyes.

Garrett knew she was watching him in the rearview mirror, watching him close the distance. There's still a chance…</div>
