<div class="line_en">So Théoden and Éowyn came to the City of Gondor, and all who saw them bared their heads and bowed; and they passed through the ash and fume of the burned circle, and went on and up along the streets of stone. To Merry the ascent seemed agelong, a meaningless journey in a hateful dream, going on and on to some dim ending that memory cannot seize.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="希优顿和伊欧玟就这么进入刚铎的主城，所有遇见他们的人都脱帽敬礼；一行人穿越了焦黑的第一城，继续在石板路上前进。对梅里来说，他们彷佛花了好几年的时间在走路，这是在噩梦中一场永无止尽的跋涉，人们不停地走着，最后只能面对晦暗的结局。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Already men were labouring to clear a way through the jetsam of battle; and now out from the Gate came some bearing litters. Gently they laid Éowyn upon soft pillows; but the king's body they covered with a great cloth of gold, and they bore torches about him, and their flames, pale in the sunlight, were fluttered by the wind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="人们开始设法在残骸中清出一条道路来，几个人扛着担架从正门走出。他们小心将伊欧玟放在柔软的枕头上，用金色的布盖住国王的尸体；他们还拿着几支火把，火焰在阳光下显得相形失色，却被风吹得左右摇动。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A mist was in Merry's eyes of tears and weariness when they drew near the ruined Gate of Minas Tirith. He gave little heed to the wreck and slaughter that lay about all. Fire and smoke and stench was in the air; for many engines had been burned or cast into the fire-pits, and many of the slain also, while here and there lay many carcases of the great Southron monsters, half-burned, or broken by stone-cast, or shot through the eyes by the valiant archers of Morthond. The flying rain had ceased for a time, and the sun gleamed up above; but all the lower city was still wrapped in a smouldering reek.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当梅里终于靠近米那斯提力斯已成废墟的城门时，他的双眼已经因为疲倦和泪水而变得迷蒙一片，他对四周残破的一切和杀戮的景象毫不在意。空气中充满了火场的气味，许多攻城的装置都被烧毁或是被推入着火的壕沟中，许多尸体也被用同样的方式处理。战场上到处都是南方巨兽的尸体，它们有些被烧死、有些被巨石砸死、有些则是被摩颂的精锐弓箭手射穿眼珠而死。大雨已经停了好一阵子，太阳开始露出脸来，但整个下城依旧笼罩在恶臭的烟雾中。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Pippin's face was anxious. "Well, you had better come with me as quick as you can," he said. "I wish I could carry you. You aren't fit to walk any further. They shouldn't have let you walk at all; but you must forgive them. So many dreadful things have happened in the City, Merry, that one poor hobbit coming in from the battle is easily overlooked."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="皮聘露出紧张的表情。“看来你最好赶快跟我来，”他说：“真希望我抱得动你，你不应该再走路了，他们根本就不应该让你走过来，不过你也必须原谅他们。这里发生了那么多悲惨的事情，梅里，一名刚离开战场的哈比人很容易就会被忽略。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's not always a misfortune being overlooked," said Merry. "I was overlooked just now by -- no, no, I can't speak of it. Help me, Pippin! It's all going dark again, and my arm is so cold."</div>

<div class="line_en">It was not long before Gandalf himself came in search of them. He stooped over Merry and caressed his brow; then he lifted him carefully. "He should have been borne in honour into this city," he said. "He has well repaid my trust; for if Elrond had not yielded to me, neither of you would have set out; and then far more grievous would the evils of this day have been." He sighed. "And yet here is another charge on my hands, while all the time the battle hangs in the balance."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不久后，甘道夫就亲自来找他们。他弯身察看梅里的情况，揉着他的眉心，然后小心地将他抱起。“他应该接受最隆重的礼节被送进城内，”他说：“他果然没有辜负我的信任！如果爱隆不接受我的建议，你们两个都不会跟着远征队出发，今天的状况可能就不会如此了。”他叹了一口气说：“不过，这也算是我的责任，而这场战争也还没结束。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'll never get him there," thought Pippin. "Is there no one to help me? I can't leave him here." Just then to his surprise a boy came running up behind, and as he passed he recognized Bergil Beregond's son.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我这样没办法把他带过去，”皮聘想着：“难道没人可以帮我了吗？我不能把他丢在这边。”就在此时，一名男孩跑了过来，他发现对方正是贝瑞贡的儿子伯几尔。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Don't!" said Pippin. "But tell them up there that I have a sick hobbit, a perian mind you, come from the battle-field. I don't think he can walk so far. If Mithrandir is there, he will be glad of the message." Bergil ran on.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不是找你聊天！”皮聘说：“请你通知上面，我身边有个哈比人，也就是你们所说的派里安。他刚从战场回来，我想他走不动了。如果米斯兰达在那边，他听到这消息会很高兴的。”伯几尔拔腿就跑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I am running errands for the Healers," said Bergil. "I cannot stay."</div>

<div class="line_en">"I'd better wait here," thought Pippin. So he let Merry sink gently down on to the pavement in a patch of sunlight, and then he sat down beside him, laying Merry's head in his lap. He felt his body and limbs gently, and took his friend's hands in his own. The right hand felt icy to the touch.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我最好在这边等，”皮聘自言自语道。他让梅里躺在阳光下，自己坐在旁边，把梅里的头放在自己的膝盖上。他温柔地按摩着梅里的四肢，紧握着朋友的手，梅里的右手相当冰冷。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So at last Faramir and Éowyn and Meriadoc were laid in beds in the Houses of Healing; and there they were tended well. For though all lore was in these latter days fallen from its fullness of old, the leechcraft of Gondor was still wise, and skilled in the healing of wound and hurt, and all such sickness as east of the Sea mortal men were subject to. Save old age only. For that they had found no cure; and indeed the span of their lives had now waned to little more than that of other men, and those among them who passed the tale of five score years with vigour were grown few, save in some houses of purer blood. But now their art and knowledge were baffled; for there were many sick of a malady that would not be healed; and they called it the Black Shadow, for it came from the Nazgûl. And those who were stricken with it fell slowly into an ever deeper dream, and then passed to silence and a deadly cold, and so died. And it seemed to the tenders of the sick that on the Halfling and on the Lady of Rohan this malady lay heavily. Still at whiles as the morning wore away they would speak, murmuring in their dreams; and the watchers listened to all that they said, hoping perhaps to learn something that would help them to understand their hurts. But soon they began to fall down into the darkness, and as the sun turned west a grey shadow crept over their faces. But Faramir burned with a fever that would not abate.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后，法拉墨、伊欧玟和梅里雅达克都躺在医院的病床上，众人十分细心地照顾他们。虽然在这个时候，古代的知识大都已经失传，但刚铎的医术依旧足以让他们感到自豪。刚铎的医生擅于治疗伤口和疼痛，以及海以东的人类会感染的所有疾病。除了年老之外，他们都治得好。他们找不到长寿的方法，事实上，他们的平均寿命大幅衰减，已经跟一般的人类没有多大差异；除了拥有纯粹血统的家族之外，能够超过一百岁依然硬朗的人已经很少了。此时，他们的医术正受到最严苛的挑战，有许多拥有同样症状的病患是他们医不好的，他们称这为黑影病，因为这种病源来自于戒灵。染上这种病的人会陷入深沉的睡梦中，然后全身冰冷，接着就药石罔效了。对于此地的医生来说，这名半身人和洛汗之女的病况已经属于棘手的后期。今天早上，他们两人在梦中发出呓语，众人仔细地听着，希望能从中找出他们受伤的原因。很快的，他们就陷入沉沉的睡梦中。当太阳西沉时，他们的面孔盖上了一层灰色的阴影，法拉墨的高烧则是一直不退。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then an old wife, Ioreth, the eldest of the women who served in that house, looking on the fair face of Faramir, wept, for all the people loved him. And she said: "Alas! if he should die. Would that there were kings in Gondor, as there were once upon a time, they say! For it is said in old lore: The hands of the king are the hands of a healer. And so the rightful king could ever be known."</div>

And so the day passed, while the great battle outside went on with shifting hopes and strange tidings; and still Gandalf waited and watched and did not go forth; till at last the red sunset filled all the sky, and the light through the windows fell on the grey faces of the sick.

But they found his chair empty, and before the dais lay Théoden King of the Mark upon a bed of state; and twelve torches stood about it, and twelve guards, knights both of Rohan and Gondor. And the hangings of the bed were of green and white, but upon the king was laid the great cloth of gold up to his breast, and upon that his unsheathed sword, and at his feet his shield.

<div class="line_en">And the cloaked man spoke and said: "He is come."

"I have come because Gandalf begs me to do so," he said. "But for the present I am but the Captain of the Dúnedain of Arnor; and the Lord of Dol Amroth shall rule the City until Faramir awakes.

Few other griefs amid the ill chances of this world have more bitterness and shame for a man's heart than to behold the love of a lady so fair and brave that cannot be returned. Sorrow and pity have followed me ever since I left her desperate in Dunharrow and rode to the Paths of the Dead; and no fear upon that way was so present as the fear for what might befall her. And yet, Éomer, I say to you that she loves you more truly than me; for you she loves and knows; but in me she loves only a shadow and a thought: a hope of glory and great deeds, and lands far from the fields of Rohan."</div>
