<div class="line_en">Next day I told my story to all the villagers. The villagers were angry. Martha was very unhappy.</div>

<div class="line_en">She said, 'Saul is working very hard. He is sending money and we can't have the money. What are we going to do?</div>

<div class="line_en">So I travelled to Darpur again on Saturday, for the third time. After a long time, I found Mr Sheth's house. The door was opened by a tall man.</div>

<div class="line_en">I took the letter and thanked the school teacher.</div>

<div class="line_en">'Mr Sheth?' I said, 'Who is he?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">'He's an important man in Darpur and he's a friend of my wife's cousin,' replied the school teacher. 'This letter is to Mr Sheth. The letter is about your money order. Perhaps he can help you.'</div>

<div class="line_en">I gave the tall man the letter. Then I waited. Later, a large black car came and a man went into the house. A long time later, the tall man opened the door again.</div>

<div class="line_en">'Yes, I know,' said Mr Sheth. 'Thank you for the letter. I hope I can help you. I like to help people. Please, sit down.' Mr Sheth smiled. His clothes were new and smart.</div>

<div class="line_en">'Can I see the money order, please?' Mr Sheth asked.</div>

<div class="line_en">I took the money order out of my pocket. By now, the money order was dirty and looked very old. I gave it to Mr Sheth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">'This money order is for one hundred dollars,' I said. 'My son sent it from a foreign country.'</div>

<div class="line_en">I said nothing. Mr Sheth gave me the money order back.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then Mr Sheth looked at the money order again. 'Yes, worthless. Your son does not understand about money orders. This money order is not correct for our country,' Mr Sheth said. Then he looked at the money order again and said, 'And this money order is also old. It is out-of-date.'</div>

<div class="line_en">Then Mr Sheth smiled and said, 'I am very sorry. You are an old man. You came a long way from your village. What can I give you to eat and drink?'</div>

<div class="line_en">I was not hungry. But Mr Sheth went out of the room. Then he brought me some coffee and some cakes. I drank my coffee.</div>

<div class="line_en">I gave my money order to Mr Sheth. 'Yes, this money order is worthless,' he said again. 'But I am going to help you. I am going to change this money order for you. I am going to give you some money.'</div>

<div class="line_en">Mr Sheth went out of the room. I felt very happy again. After a few minutes, the tall man came into the room. He gave me an envelope. 'This is from Mr Sheth. You can go now,' the tall man said.</div>
