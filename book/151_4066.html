<div class="line_en">I hadn't had the chance to write a letter to Mom and Dad and Via yet, so I wrote one telling them all about the stuff we did that day and the day before. I pictured myself reading it to them out loud when I got back, since there was just no way the letter would get home before I did.</div>

<div class="line_en">When we got to the fairgrounds, the sun was just starting to set. It was about seven-thirty. The shadows were really long on the grass, and the clouds were pink and orange. It looked like someone had taken sidewalk chalk and smudged the colors across the sky with their fingers. It's not that I haven't seen nice sunsets before in the city, because I have -- slivers of sunsets between buildings -- but I wasn't used to seeing so much sky in every direction. Out here in the fairgrounds, I could understand why ancient people used to think the world was flat and the sky was a dome that closed in on top of it. That's what it looked like from the fairgrounds, in the middle of this huge open field.</div>

<div class="line_en">The next day was just as great as the first day. We went horseback riding in the morning, and in the afternoon we rappelled up some ginormous trees with the help of the nature guides. By the time we got back to the cabins for dinner, we were all really tired again. After dinner they told us we had an hour to rest, and then we were going to take a fifteen-minute bus ride to the fairgrounds for an outdoor movie night.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天就像第一天一样开心。我们早上去骑马，下午又在自然导游的指导下爬上了几棵参天大树。等回到小木屋吃晚饭的时候，大家又都疲惫不堪。晚饭后，他们告诉我们，我们有一小时的休息时间，然后大家就坐十五分钟的车到游乐场去体验户外电影之夜。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Because we were the first school to arrive, we got to run around the field all we wanted until the teachers told us it was time to lay out our sleeping bags on the ground and get good viewing seats. We unzipped our bags and laid them down like picnic blankets on the grass in front of the giant movie screen in the middle of the field. Then we went to the row of food trucks parked at the edge of the field to load up on snacks and sodas and stuff like that. There were concession stands there, too, like at a farmers' market, selling roasted peanuts and cotton candy. And up a little farther was a short row of carnival-type stalls, the kind where you can win a stuffed animal if you throw a baseball into a basket. Jack and I both tried -- and failed -- to win anything, but we heard Amos won a yellow hippo and gave it to Ximena. That was the big gossip that went around: the jock and the brainiac.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因为我们学校是到得最早的，我们便可以在空地上由着性子东奔西跑，直到老师招呼我们可以去找一个观赏效果最好的位置，把睡袋铺到地上。我们解开行李袋，像把野餐毯铺在草地上一样，在空地中央的巨大电影屏幕前面把睡袋铺开。然后我们去停在游乐场边的一排食品车那里，买回一大堆零食和汽水。那边也有很多小摊贩，卖着烤花生和烤棉花糖，就像在农贸市场一样。稍远一点，是一排嘉年华式的摊位，就是那种你可以玩把棒球扔到篮子里赢得填充毛绒玩具之类的游戏的地方。杰克和我都试了一下，但都空手而归，不过我们听说阿莫斯赢了一只黄色的河马，把它送给了西蒙娜。于是绯闻不胫而走：运动员与学霸。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">From the food trucks, you could see the cornstalks in back of the movie screen. They covered about a third of the entire field. The rest of the field was completely surrounded by woods. As the sun sank lower in the sky, the tall trees at the entrance to the woods looked dark blue.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从食品车那里望出去，你可以看到电影屏幕后面的玉米田，玉米秸秆覆盖了整个原野的三分之一。剩下的地方全部都被森林包围了。当夕阳在天空继续下沉时，森林入口处的高大树木呈一片深蓝色。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Just then, without any announcement, all the lights at the ends of the field went on at once. They were like big bright stadium lights. I thought of that scene in Close Encounters when the alien ship lands and they're playing that music: duh-dah-doo-da-dunnn. Everyone in the field started applauding and cheering like something great had just happened.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在这时，没有任何预兆地，游乐场两头的灯突然亮了。是那种又大又刺眼的体育场用灯。我想到了电影《近距离接触》的一个画面——外星飞船降落下来，音乐响起：嘟—哒—嘟—哒—当。游乐场上所有人都开始鼓掌、欢呼起来，好像有什么重大事件即将发生。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">By the time the other school buses pulled into the parking lots, we were back in our spots on the sleeping bags, right smack in front of the screen: the best seats in the whole field. Everyone was passing around snacks and having a great time. Me and Jack and Summer and Reid and Maya played Pictionary. We could hear the sounds of the other schools arriving, the loud laughing and talking of kids coming out on the field on both sides of us, but we couldn't really see them. Though the sky was still light, the sun had gone down completely, and everything on the ground had turned deep purple. The clouds were shadows now. We had trouble even seeing the Pictionary cards in front of us.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当其他学校的大巴驶进停车场时，我们已经回到了铺着自己睡袋的地方，就在大屏幕的前面：那是全场最好的位置。大家传递着小吃，开心地嬉闹着。我、杰克、萨默尔、瑞德和玛雅在玩猜谜。我们可以听到其他学校的学生抵达的声音，四周传出大笑声和孩子们说话的声音，但我们看不清楚他们。虽然天还亮着，但是太阳已经完全沉落下去了，地上的一切都变成了深紫色。云现在也变成了一团团影子。我们已经看不清面前的谜题卡了。">查看中文翻译</div>
