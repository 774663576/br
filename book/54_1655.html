<div class="line_en">The ride home was long and silent. None of us felt like talking, not even T. J. Big Ma had informed him shortly after leaving Strawberry that she did not want to hear another word out of him before we reached home. He sulked for a while with a few audible grumbles which no one paid any attention to, but finally he fell asleep and did not awaken until we had driven up the Granger road and stopped in front of the Avery house.</div>

<div class="line_en">By the time Jack pulled into our own yard, the night was a thick blackness and smelled strongly of a coming rain. Big Ma climbed wearily down from the wagon and went into the house without a word, I stayed with Stacey to help him put the wagon inside the barn and unhitch and feed Jack. While I held the flashlight on the barn doors, Stacey slowly slid aside the plank of wood that held the doors fastened. "Cassie," he said, in a quiet, thoughtful voice, "don't go blaming Big Ma for what she done."</div>

<div class="line_en">"What's Mr. Granger's car doing in our barn!" I exclaimed as the silver Packard was unveiled by the light. Without answering me, Stacey swiftly turned and ran toward the house. I followed closely behind. Throwing open the door to Mama's room, we stood dumbfounded in the doorway. Instead of Mr. Granger, a tall, handsome man, nattily dressed in a gray pin-striped suit and vest, stood by the fire with his arm around Big Ma. For a moment we swayed with excitement, then as if by signal we both cried, "Uncle Hammer!" and dashed into his arms.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“格兰杰先生的车怎么会在谷仓里？”看到一辆银色轿车出现在眼前，我惊讶万分。斯泰西迅速转身跑到屋里，我紧紧跟在后头。一打开妈妈房间的门，我俩便呆住了。一个高大英俊的男子，穿着笔挺的灰条纹西装和小背心，坐在火炉边，搂着奶奶。我和斯泰西激动地叫起来：“哈默大伯！”随即跑向了他的怀抱。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Uncle Hammer smiled a strange, wry smile. "Well, not exactly like it, Mama. Mine's a few months newer. Last year when I come down here, I was right impressed with that big ole Packard of Mr. Harlan Filmore Granger's and I thought I'd like to own one myself. It seems that me and Harlan Granger just got the same taste." He winked slyly at Stacey. "Don't it, Stacey!"</div>

<div class="line_en">Uncle Hammer was two years older than Papa and, un- married, he came every winter to spend the Christmas sea- son with us. Like Papa, he had dark, red-brown skin, a square-jawed face, and high cheekbones; yet there was a great difference between them somehow. His eyes, which showed a great warmth as he hugged and kissed us now, often had a cold, distant glaze, and there was an aloofness in him which the boys and I could never quite bridge, When he let us go, Stacey and I both grew consciously shy, and we backed away. I sat down beside Christopher- John and Little Man, who were silently gazing up at Uncle Hammer, but Stacey stammered, "Wh-what's Mr. Granger's car doing in our barn!"</div>

Christopher-John and Little Man, who Big Ma had feared would be moping because they had not been allowed to go to town, seemed not at all concerned that Stacey and I had gone. They were awestruck by Uncle Hammer, and compared to his arrival a day in Strawberry was a minor matter.</div>

<div class="line_en">"They also said that slavery was good for us because it taught us to be good Christians -- like the white people." She sighed deeply, her voice fading into a distant whisper. "But they didn't teach us Christianity to save our souls, but to teach us obedience.

<div class="line_en">Mama nodded again. "That's right, honey. He was hiding in a cave when freedom came, so I understand." She was silent a moment, then went on. "Well, after a while. slavery became so profitable to people who had slaves and even to those who didn't that most folks decided to believe that black people really weren't people like everybody else. And when the Civil War was fought and Mama Rachel and Papa Luke and all the other slaves were freed, people continued to think that way. Even the Northerners who fought the war didn't really see us equal to white people. So now, even though seventy years have passed since slavery, most white people still think of us as they did then -- that we're not as good as they are -- and people like Mr. Simms hold on to that belief harder than some other folks because they have little else to hold on to. For him to believe that he is better than we are makes him think that he's important, simply because he's white."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="妈妈点点头，接着说：“是的，宝贝。他最后逃到了一个洞穴里，躲了起来。”她顿了一会儿：“奴隶制度盛行时，很多人都认为，白人比黑人优越。南北战争后，奴隶被解放出来了，可很多人的想法并没有改变，甚至连那些北方佬也没有真正平等地看待黑人。所以，虽然奴隶制度已经被废止了七十多年，但大多数白人还是认为黑人不如他们。就像西蒙先生一样，他那么固执，因为他也没有什么东西可以用来维持自己的尊严了。他觉得自己比黑人优越，仅仅是因为他是白人。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It ain't fair." Christopher-John sympathized, patting me lightly with his pudgy hand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“太不公平了。”克里斯托弗同情地说，用他那胖乎乎的手拍了拍我的肩膀。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Ah, shoot!" I exclaimed, my dream of revenge against the Simmses vanishing as Stacey talked. I propped my elbows on my knees, then settled my head in my upraised hands and stared into the glowing embers. A burning knot formed in my throat and I felt as if my body was not large enough to hold the frustration I felt, nor deep enough to drown the rising anger.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“噢，天哪！”我那报仇的愿望一下子成了泡影。我把手肘靠着膝盖，托着脑袋，静静地看着炉火一闪一灭。我的喉咙里仿佛卡着一块灼烧的炭火，内心的愤怒仿佛岩浆一般快要喷涌出来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Cassie." Stacey said softly. At first I didn't look at him, thinking he would go ahead and say what he had to say. But when he didn't, I turned toward him. He leaned forward secretively and automatically Christopher-John and Little Man did the same.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“凯西。”斯泰西柔声说。起初我没有看着他，觉得他会继续说下去，但他并没有。我按捺不住，转向他。他神秘兮兮地靠向我，小家伙和克里斯托弗也凑了过来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="哈默大伯拦住我们：“斯泰西，你只有这一件外套吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Stacey looked down at his faded cotton jacket. Everyone else did too. The jacket was too small for him, that was obvious, and compared to Little Man's and Christopher-John's and mine, it was admittedly in sadder shape. Yet we were all surprised that Uncle Hammer would ask about it, for he knew as well as anyone that Mama had to buy our clothes in shifts, which meant that we each had to wait our turn for new clothes. Stacey looked up at Mama, then back at Uncle Hammer. "Y-yessir," he answered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们全都望向斯泰西的外套，斯泰西也低下头，看着他那褪了色的棉外套。那件外套对他来说实在太小了，而且，跟我们的外套比起来，他的外套的确显得更加寒酸。但我们很惊讶哈默大伯这么问，因为他也知道，妈妈是轮流给我们买衣服的。斯泰西看了一眼妈妈，又看向大伯，回答道：“是的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Uncle Hammer stared at him, then waving his hand ordered. "Take it off." Before Stacey could question why, Uncle Hammer disappeared into the boys' room.</div>

<div class="line_en">Uncle Hammer returned with a long box, store wrapped in shiny red Christmas paper and a fancy green ribbon. He handed the package to Stacey. "It was supposed to be your Christmas present, but I think I'd better give it to you now. It's cold out there."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大伯从房间里出来，手里拿着一个长长的盒子，盒子外包装着红色闪亮的圣诞彩纸，上面还系了一条绿色缎带。他把盒子递给斯泰西：“本来打算把它当作圣诞节礼物送给你的。不过我觉得现在给你更合适一些，现在天也冷了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The morning was gray as we stepped outside, but the rain had stopped. We followed the path of bedded rocks that led to the barn, careful not to slip into the mud, and got into the Packard. shining clean and bright from the washing Uncle Hammer and Mr. Morrison had given it after break- fast. Inside the Packard, the world was a wine-colored luxury. The boys and I, in the back, ran our hands over the rich felt seats, tenderly fingered the fancy door handles and window knobs, and peered down amazed at the pillow and carpet peeping out on either side of the rubber mats.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="屋外灰蒙蒙的一片，好在雨停了。我们沿着石块铺出的小路走到谷仓，尽量不让自己踩到泥坑里。由于大伯跟莫里森先生早饭后才洗过车，车子看起来格外干净闪亮。车子里头是高贵的酒红色。我和男孩们坐在车后座，用手抚摸着柔软舒适的座椅，扳动着精致的车门把，摇动着车窗玻璃的把手。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Stacey eagerly slipped on the coat; it was much too big for him, but Mama said that she could take up the sleeves and that he would grow into it in another year. Stacey beamed down at the coat, then up at Uncle Hammer. A year ago he would have shot into Uncle Hammer's arms and hugged his thanks, but now at the manly age of twelve he held out his hand, and Uncle Hammer shook it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯泰西急切地套上外套。外套对他来说太大了，不过妈妈说再过一年就合身了。斯泰西仔细瞧着身上的外套，眼睛发亮。要是在一年前，他肯定会冲上去给哈默大伯一个拥抱。不过现在的他，已经十二岁了，应该表现得成熟些。他握了握哈默大伯的手，致了谢。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="军人路坡度大，还很曲折。每当车子驶过，都会扬起阵阵尘土，路上的碎石还不断硌着车底盘，车子总会一上一下地颠簸。遇到这种情况，我、小家伙，还有克里斯托弗都会兴奋地大叫，好像坐上了云霄飞车一样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="车子开到了杰斐逊大卫学校前，哈默大伯把车子停在了岔路口，右臂重重地搭在方向盘上，没精打采地望向华莱士商店，他这样说：“真想烧了那间店啊。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Soldiers Bridge was built before the Civil War. It was spindly and wooden, and each time I had to cross it I held my breath until I was safely on the other side. Only one vehicle could cross at a time, and whoever was on the bridge first was supposed to have the right of way, although it didn't always work that way. More than once when I had been in the wagon with Mama or Big Ma, we had had to back off the bridge when a white family started across after we were already on it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="军人桥是内战前建的狭长木桥。我每次过桥，都会屏住呼吸，直到安全过桥才松口气。桥上一次只能允许一辆车子通过。每次我跟妈妈，还有奶奶驾车要过桥时，只要有一辆白人的车子出现，我们就得退出来，让他们先过去。">查看中文翻译</div>

The driver of the truck stopped, and for no more than a second hesitated on the bridge, then without a single honk of protest backed off so that we could pass.</div>
