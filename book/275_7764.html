<div class="line_en">Faithful Johannes was his favorite servant, and was so called, because he had been so loyal to him for his whole life long. When he approached the bed the king said to him, "Most faithful Johannes, I feel that my end is near. My only concern is for my son. He is still young and may not always have the best judgment. I will not be able to close my eyes in peace if you do not promise to teach him everything that he ought to know, and to be his foster father."</div>

<div class="line_en">At this, the old king said, "Then I will die in comfort and peace," adding, "After my death, show him the entire castle -- all the chambers, halls, and vaults, and all the treasures which lie therein. But do not show him the last chamber in the long gallery, which contains the portrait of the Princess of the Golden Roof. If he sees that picture, he will fall violently in love with her, will fall down unconscious, and will put himself at GREat risk for her sake. You must protect him from that."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="国王欣然说道：「现在我就放心了。我死后，你领着他把整座王宫的所有房间和库房，包括房子里的所有财宝看一遍。但要注意，有一间房子不能让他进去，就是那间挂有金屋公主画像的房间。如果他进去看了，就会深深地爱上她，并会因此而陷入万劫不复的险境。你千万要负起这个责任来。」">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After the old king had been carried to his grave, faithful Johannes told the young king all that he had promised his father on his deathbed, and said, "I will surely keep my promise, and will be loyal to you as I have been loyal to him, even if it should cost me my life."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="老国王被安葬之后，忠实的约翰把老国王临终前的一切嘱托和自己的誓言都告诉了年青的国王，并说道：「我一定会忠实地执行自己的诺言，对你就像对你的父亲一样忠诚不二，即使献出自己的生命也在所不辞。」年青的国王哭泣着说：「我永远也不会忘记你的忠心。」">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When the mourning was over, faithful Johannes said to the young king, "It is now time for you to see your inheritance. I will show you your father's castle." Then he took him everywhere, up and down, and let him see all the riches and the magnificent chambers. But there was one chamber which he did not open, the one that contained the dangerous portrait. Now the portrait was so placed that when the door was opened one looked straight at it. It was so masterfully painted that it seemed to live and breathe and to be the most charming beautiful thing in the whole world.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="丧事办完以后，忠实的约翰对他的小主人说：「现在你应该看看你所继承的财产了，我带你去你父亲的宫殿里看看吧。」接着他引导小主人在王宫上上下下的各个地方都巡视了一遍，让他看过了所有的财富和豪华的房厅，唯独挂着图像的那间房子没有打开。因为，那里面挂着的画像只要门一打开就看得见。那画像画得实在是太美了，让人看了会有种呼之欲出的感觉，世界上再也没有甚么东西比画上的女子更可爱、更美丽了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">the young king noticed that faithful Johannes always walked past this one door, and said, "Why do you never open this one for me?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Faithful Johannes saw that there was no other way. With a heavy heart and many sighs, he took the key from the large ring. After opening the door, he went in first, thinking that he could block king's view of the portrait, that the king would not see it in front of him. But what good did it do? The king stood on tiptoes and saw the portrait over faithful Johannes's shoulder. After seeing the girl's portrait, which was so magnificent and glistened with gold and precious stones, he fell unconscious to the ground.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="忠实的约翰看到他再怎么劝说，年青的国王就是不肯离去，心里有了不祥的预感，沉重地歎了歎气，从一大串钥匙中找出一片钥匙，打开了这个房子的门。门一打开，约翰便先走了进去，站在了国王和画像之间，希望能挡着画像不让国王看见，但年青的国王却踮着脚尖从他的肩头看过去，一下子就看到了公主的肖像。目睹画上穿金戴银的少女如此美丽动人、娇艳妩媚的容貌，他心情激动极了，竟马上倒在楼板上昏了过去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">the faithful servant thought to himself for a long time how to approach the matter, for it was difficult even to come into view of the king's daughter. Finally he thought of a way, and said to the king, "Everything which she has about her is of gold -- tables, chairs, dishes, cups, bowls, and household implements. Among your treasures are five tons of gold. Have the royal goldsmiths fashion one ton into all manner of vessels and utensils, into all kinds of birds, wild beasts, and strange animals.

<div class="line_en">When he entered the courtyard of the castle, a beautiful girl was standing there by the well with two golden buckets in her hand, drawing water with them. She was just turning around to carry away the sparkling water when she saw the stranger and asked who he was.</div>

<div class="line_en">the king summoned all the goldsmiths, and they had to work night and day until at last the most splendid things were prepared.
