<div class="line_en">"Why would he run away if he knew he was getting released today?" asked Mr. Pendanski.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“要是他知道今天就被释放了，那他干吗还要逃跑呢？”潘登斯基先生问道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Who knows? He's crazy. That was why we couldn't release him yesterday. He was delirious, and we had to keep watch over him so he wouldn't hurt himself or anybody else."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“谁知道！他疯了呗。所以昨天我们没法将他放走。他神志不清，我们不得不一直看着他，以免他伤害到自己或其他人。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"We're going to keep our story simple," said the Warden. "That woman's going to ask a lot of questions. The A. G. will most likely initiate an investigation. So this is what happened: Stanley tried to run away in the night, fell in a hole, and the lizards got him. That's it. We're not even going to give them Zero's body. As far as anybody knows, Zero doesn't exist. Like Mom said, we got plenty of graves to choose from."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们要把故事编得简单一点，”管理员大人说，“那个女人会问很多问题，A.G．（2）很有可能还会展开调查。所以，事情应该是这样的——斯坦利想趁着夜色溜走，结果掉进了洞里，蜥蜴逮到了他。就这样。我们甚至都不用把零蛋的尸体给他们。众所周知，零蛋根本不存在。就像老妈说的，我们有很多坟墓可供选择。”【注：（2）Attorney General的缩写，意为总检察长。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Stanley only half listened to the talk of the counselors. He didn't know who "that woman" was or what "A. G." meant. He didn't even realize they were initials. It sounded like one word, "Age-ee." His mind was focused on the tiny claws that moved up and down his skin and through his hair.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯坦利只能零星听到训导员们的谈话。他不知道“那个女人”是谁，也不明白A.G．是什么意思。他甚至没有意识到A.G．只是大写字母。它听起像是“Age-ee（年龄）”之类的词。他的注意力都集中在他的皮肤和头发里爬来爬去的那些小爪子上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">His brain took him back to a time when he was very little, all bundled up in a snowsuit. He and his mother were walking, hand in hand, mitten in mitten, when they both slipped on some ice and fell and rolled down a snow-covered hillside. They ended up at the bottom of the hill. He remembered he almost cried, but instead he laughed. His mother laughed, too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的思绪把他带回到儿时。他穿着滑雪衣，和妈妈手拉手，手套连着手套地散步。忽然，他们滑倒在冰面上，沿着积雪的山坡一路滚到山脚。他记得自己差点就哭了，但还是笑了。妈妈也笑了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He tried to think about other things. He didn't want to die with the images of the Warden, Mr. Sir, and the lizards etched into his brain. Instead, he tried to see his mother's face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他努力去想一些其他的事。他可不希望死的时候满脑子装的都是管理员大人、长官先生和蜥蜴的模样。他要看的是妈妈的脸。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He could feel the same light-headed feeling he felt then, dizzy from rolling down the hill. He felt the sharp coldness of the snow against his ear. He could see flecks of snow on his mother's bright and cheery face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他当时的感觉就像现在一样头昏眼花，但那是因为滚下了山。他感到冰冷的雪花落在他的耳朵上。他能看到一片片雪花落在他妈妈兴高采烈的脸上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This was where he wanted to be when he died.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这才是他死的时候想去的地方。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Hey, Caveman, guess what?" said Mr. Sir. "You're innocent, after all. I thought you'd like to know that. Your lawyer came to get you yesterday. Too bad you weren't here."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嘿，洞穴人。你猜怎么着？”长官先生说，“到头来，你的确是无辜的。我想你乐意知道这件事。你的律师昨天来带你走。令人遗憾的是你不在。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The words meant nothing to Stanley, who was still in the snow. He and his mother climbed back up the hill and rolled down again, this time on purpose. Later they had hot chocolate with lots of melted marshmallows.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对斯坦利而言，这些话毫无意义，他仍在那片雪地里。他和妈妈爬回山顶，又滚下来，这次是故意的。后来，他们喝了热巧克力，里面有很多溶化了的棉花糖。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“让他们发挥一下自己的想象力。”管理员大人说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Warden told the counselors to return to the tents. She told them to give the campers breakfast and to make sure they didn't talk to anyone. As long as they did as they were told, they wouldn't have to dig any more holes. If they talked, they would be severely punished.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="管理员大人让训导员们回营地给营员们分发早餐，不准营员们把这件事情说出去。只要他们照做，就不用再挖洞了。要是他们讲出去，就会受到严惩。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Stanley watched the counselors return to the tents, leaving only the Warden and Mr. Sir behind. He knew the Warden didn't care whether the campers dug any more holes or not. She'd found what she was looking for.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯坦利看着训导员们纷纷回去了，只有管理员大人和长官先生留下来。他知道管理员大人再也不会操心营员们是否会继续挖洞了。她已经找到了一直在找的东西。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He glanced at Zero. A lizard was perched on his shoulder.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他瞥了一眼零蛋。一只蜥蜴正伏在他的肩膀上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Zero remained perfectly still except for his right hand, which slowly formed into a fist. Then he raised his thumb, giving Stanley the thumbs-up sign.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="零蛋仍旧纹丝不动，但他的右手慢慢地攥成拳头。然后他竖起大拇指，冲斯坦利打了个手势。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Stanley thought back to what Mr. Sir had said to him earlier, and the bits of conversation he'd overheard. He tried to make sense out of it. Mr. Sir had said something about a lawyer, but Stanley knew his parents couldn't afford a lawyer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯坦利回想起刚才长官先生对他说过的话，还有他刚刚听到的一些对话，试图弄清楚这一切到底是怎么回事。长官先生提到了律师，可斯坦利知道他父母是请不起律师的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="蜥蜴们似乎并不介意。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His legs were sore from remaining rigid for so long. Standing still was more strenuous than walking. He slowly allowed himself to lean against the side of the hole.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他僵硬地站了那么久，两条腿酸痛不堪。站着不动比走路要累多了。他缓缓地靠在洞壁上。">查看中文翻译</div>
