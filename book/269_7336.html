<div class="line_en">Jake pursed his lips, still hanging back from the door. His eyes flickered across the front of the house.</div>

<div class="line_en">Hostility rolled off of him in waves. It brought back that awful afternoon when he'd chosen Sam over me, and I felt my chin jerk up defensively in response.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的脸上露出一阵敌对的神色，令我想起了那个糟糕的下午，当时他选择了山姆，没有选择我。此刻，我觉得自己的下颌开始抽搐，进入了防御的状态。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I sprinted down the stairs and threw the door open.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我快步下楼，打开了门。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He hesitated. "You're alone?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他犹豫了一下，说：“只有你一个人在？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jacob's Rabbit idled by the curb with Jared behind the wheel and Embry in the passenger seat. I understood what this meant: they were afraid to let him come here alone. It made me sad, and a little annoyed. The Cullens weren't like that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="雅各布的“兔子”在路边移动，杰瑞德坐在驾驶座上，恩布里坐在乘客位上。我知道他们是不放心让雅各布单独过来，这让我有点儿难过，有些不高兴，卡伦家人就不会这样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was standing about six feet back from the door, his nose wrinkled in distaste, but his face otherwise smooth -- masklike. He didn't fool me; I could see the faint trembling of his hands.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他站在离门六英尺远的地方，远看上去，他皱着鼻子，但是脸上却很平滑——像戴着个假面具一样。不过这骗不了我，我看到他的双手在微微颤抖。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jacob glanced over his shoulder at his friends in the car. I saw Embry shake his head just a tiny bit. For some reason, this bugged me to no end.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="雅各布回头看看坐在车上的朋友。我看到恩布里微微摇了摇头。不知为什么，这让我很生气。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I locked gazes with first Jared and then Embry -- I didn't like the hard way they eyed me; did they really think I would let anything hurt Jacob? -- before I shut the door on them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我的双眼和杰瑞德、恩布里两人的眼睛先后撞了个正着。我不喜欢他们看我时那种严肃的眼神，他们难道真觉得我会做什么伤害雅各布的事吗？这样对视之后，我就把门关上了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jake's eyes flashed back to me, his thick, black brows pushing into a furious angle over his deep-set eyes. His jaw set, and he marched -- there was no other way to describe the way he moved -- up the sidewalk and shrugged past me into the house.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="雅各回过头看着我，他浓黑的眉毛在深陷的双眼上方，非常突出，下颌固定不动，然后迈着步子向前进——这样描述他走路最合适了——走上人行道，他从我身边闪过，向屋里走去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="雅各布在我身后的大厅，看着客厅乱糟糟的毯子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yeah," I answered with the same level of acid. I didn't like Jacob when he acted this way.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没错，”我也用同样的语气答道，我不喜欢雅各布这样说话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He wrinkled his nose again like he smelled something unpleasant. "Where's your 'friend'?" I could hear the quotation marks in his tone.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你觉得像什么？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Hey," I said, putting myself in his way. He stopped pacing and stared down at me. "What's your problem?"</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我不喜欢不得不到这儿来。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That stung. I winced, and his eyes tightened.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这话让我很受伤，我不觉向后退缩，他的眼神变得更加严肃了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Okay. Get it over with then." I was probably overdoing it with the antagonism, but I didn't want him to see how much this hurt. I knew I wasn't being fair. After all, I'd picked the bloodsucker over him last night. I'd hurt him first.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好，那你问吧。”我的话可能充满了敌意，但是我不愿意他看出我内心有多受伤。我知道这样对他不公平。毕竟昨晚我先选了吸血鬼，其次选他，是我伤害他在先。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Something about the room seemed to make him edgier -- his long arms were quivering. He didn't answer my question. Instead he moved on to the kitchen, his restless eyes darting everywhere.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="房间的某种气氛使他变得更急躁了，修长的双臂在颤抖。他没有回答我的问题，而是去了厨房，双眼四处巡视。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I just have to ask you a couple of questions. It shouldn't take long. We have to get back for the funeral."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Are the rest of them coming back now?" he asked in a cool, quiet voice. It reminded me of Sam's always calm manner. Jacob was becoming more like Sam… I wondered why that bothered me so much.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“其他人现在会回来吗？”他冷冷地、平静地问。这令我想起山姆通常镇定的举止。雅各布越来越像山姆了我不明白这个为什么让我感到不安。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“就这些么？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“怎样？”他问道，努力掩饰着他平静的表情下面的紧张。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He nodded. "You should know that we can only watch our own lands with a Cullen here. You'll only be safe in La Push. I can't protect you here anymore."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他点了点头。“你应该知道，我们只能和卡伦在这里守护我们自己的领地。在拉普什你才是安全的。我再也不能保护你了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他若有所思地点点头：“她在这儿待多久？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他为什么这么惊恐呢？问什么她一脸的痛苦、疑惑和恐惧？她刚才在电话中为什么和罗莎莉那样说话？和她看到的有关……还有罗莎莉的自责；罗莎莉对于任何发生在我身上的事从未感到自责，但是如果她伤害了她的家人，伤害了她的哥哥……">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When Edward's voice came back to me now, it was not the perfect imitation of my delusions. It was just the weak, flat tone of my memories.

Words from a time when I would have bet everything that I owned or could borrow on that fact that he loved me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时我的脑海又回荡着爱德华的声音，这声音并不是我的错觉，而是留在记忆中的平和的声音，但是这个声音足以穿透我的胸脯，在我的胸中留下一道裂口。这些话是他深爱着我的时候说的，他当时对我的爱我深信不疑。">查看中文翻译</div>

Not unless you want to die!</div>
