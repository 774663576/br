<div class="line_en">So, to Ben dead was given more care, more time, more money than had ever been given to Ben living. His burial was a final gesture of irony and futility: an effort to compensate carrion death for the unpaid wage of life -- love and mercy. He had a grand funeral. All the Pentlands sent wreaths, and came with their separate clans, bringing along with their hastily assumed funeral manners a smell of recent business. Will Pentland talked with the men about politics, the war, and trade conditions, paring his nails thoughtfully, pursing his lips and nodding in his curiously reflective way, and occasionally punning with a birdy wink. His pleased self-laughter was mixed with Henry's loud guffaw. Pett, older, kinder, gentler than Eugene had ever seen her, moved about with a rustling of gray silk, and a relaxed bitterness. And Jim was there, with his wife, whose name Eugene forgot, and his four bright hefty daughters, whose names he confused, but who had all been to college and done well, and his son, who had been to a Presbyterian college, and had been expelled for advocating free love and socialism while editor of the college paper. Now he played the violin, and loved music, and helped his father with the business: he was an effeminate and mincing young man, but of the breed. And there was Thaddeus Pentland, Will's bookkeeper, the youngest and poorest of the three. He was a man past fifty, with a pleasant red face, brown mustaches, and a gentle placid manner. He was full of puns and pleased good-nature, save when he quoted from Karl Marx and Eugene Debs. He was a Socialist, and had once received eight votes for Congress. He was there with his garrulous wife (whom Helen called Jibber-Jibber) and his two daughters, languid good-looking blondes of twenty and twenty-four.</div>

<div class="line_en">There they were, in all their glory -- that strange rich clan, with its fantastic mixture of success and impracticality, its hard monied sense, its visionary fanaticism. There they were, in their astonishing contradictions: the business man who had no business method, and yet had made his million dollars; the frantic antagonist of Capital who had given the loyal service of a lifetime to the thing he denounced; the wastrel son, with the bull vitality of the athlete, a great laugh, animal charm -- no more; the musician son, a college rebel, intelligent, fanatic, with a good head for figures; insane miserliness for oneself, lavish expenditure for one's children.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="彭特兰家的人就是那副模样，个个神气十足——是个奇特、富有的家族。他们既狂热地追求成功，又不太切合实际，他们既嗜钱如命，又狂热地幻想一切。其实，他们的存在本身就是一个难以置信的矛盾：他们身为商人却不愿意遵循做生意的陈规，然而却腰缠万贯；他们狂热地反对资本主义，却花毕生的精力为他们公然抨击的主义服务；他们是败家子，却具有运动员的充沛精力，动物一般的魅力——仅此而已；他们是音乐家、大学的叛逆者，他们聪明、狂热，长于数字；他们对自己一毛不拔，对子女却挥金如土。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There they were, each with the familiar marking of the clan -- broad nose, full lips, deep flat cheeks, deliberate pursed mouths, flat drawling voices, flat complacent laughter. There they were, with their enormous vitality, their tainted blood, their meaty health, their sanity, their insanity, their humor, their superstition, their meanness, their generosity, their fanatic idealism, their unyielding materialism. There they were, smelling of the earth and Parnassus -- that strange clan which met only at weddings or funerals, but which was forever true to itself, indissoluble and forever apart, with its melancholia, its madness, its mirth: more enduring than life, more strong than death.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们全来了，每个人都具有彭特兰家的典型标志——大鼻子、厚嘴唇、扁而深陷的脸颊、故意噘着嘴、单调的拖腔、平淡自负的笑声。他们就是那副模样，每个人都精力充沛，他们具有混合血统，身体强壮，他们精明、糊涂、幽默，他们有时候也会迷信，他们注重礼仪，他们为人慷慨，他们是狂热的理想分子，他们坚定地崇拜物质。他们就是那副模样，有时候土里土气，却具有诗人的气质——这个奇特的家族，只有在婚丧嫁娶的时候才会聚集在一处，但是他们的天性却一脉相承。他们有时候忧郁，有时候疯狂，有时候欢乐；他们与这一切不相分离却永远远离这些。比生命更长久，比死亡更强大。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And as Eugene looked, he felt again the nightmare horror of destiny: he was of them -- there was no escape. Their lust, their weakness, their sensuality, their fanaticism, their strength, their rich taint, were rooted in the marrow of his bones.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当尤金注视这些亲戚的时候，他又一次感到命运的可怕：他是他们中的一员——这一点无法逃避。他们的欲望、他们的脆弱、他们的肉欲、他们的狂热、他们的力量、他们的堕落，都深深地根植在自己的骨髓中。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The women filled the house with their moaning. Eliza wept almost constantly; Helen by fits, in loose hysterical collapse. And all the other women wept with gusto, comforting Eliza and her daughter, falling into one another's arms, wailing with keen hunger. And the men stood sadly about, dressed in their good clothes, wondering when it would be over. Ben lay in the parlor, bedded in his expensive coffin. The room was heavy with the incense of the funeral bowers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="妇女们不停地哭泣着，弄得满屋子一片愁云。伊丽莎的眼泪几乎从来没有间断过；海伦也哭哭停停，悲痛欲绝。其他的妇女一个个哭得特别起劲，她们一边安慰伊丽莎和海伦，一边彼此抱头痛哭。穿戴整洁的男人们则愁容满面地站在一旁，心里正盘算这个丧事什么时候才能结束。本恩的躯体就躺在客厅的中央，安睡在那具昂贵的棺材里，满屋子都是吊唁的鲜花，浓郁的香气扑鼻而来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">To Eugene came again the old ghoul fantasy of a corpse and cold pork, the smell of the dead and hamburger steak -- the glozed corruption of Christian burial, the obscene pomps, the perfumed carrion. Slightly nauseated, he took his seat with Eliza in the carriage, and tried to think of supper.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尤金的脑海里又回想起以前可怖的幻想：尸体和冰冷的猪肉、死人和汉堡牛排的味道——基督教葬礼的古板与虚饰、令人厌恶的壮观场面、涂着防腐油的尸体，他觉得有些恶心。在马车里，他坐在伊丽莎的身边，尽量思考着今天的晚饭。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Presently the Scotch minister arrived: his decent soul lay above all the loud posturings of grief like a bolt of hard clean wool. He began the service for the dead in a dry nasal voice, remote, monotonous, cold, and passionate.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不大一会儿，苏格兰裔的牧师来到了：他道貌岸然，像一卷结实干净的羊毛布料，掩住了痛苦流涕的悲伤情绪。他开始为死者举行丧礼，他用刺耳的鼻音做祈祷，这声音听起好像来自非常远的地方，单调、冷静、充满了感情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The procession moved off briskly to the smooth trotting pull of the velvet rumps. The mourning women peered out of the closed carriages at the gaping town. They wept behind their heavy veils, and looked to see if the town was watching. Behind the world's great mask of grief, the eyes of the mourners shone through with a terrible and indecent hunger, an unnameable lust.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在马儿迅疾的蹄声中，送葬的队伍轻快地朝前迈进。悲恸的妇人们坐在封闭的车厢里，透过车身上的小孔张望着外面的小城。他们躲在黑纱背后哭泣着，但同时还在留意外面是不是有人注视她们的悲伤。在呼天抢地的悲痛面具下，送葬者的眼睛里闪烁出可怕、不当的渴望，以及难以形容的欲望。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then, marshalled by Horse Hines, the pallbearers, young men from the paper and the town, who had known the dead man best, moved slowly out, gripping the coffin-handles with their nicotined fingers. In proper sequence, the mourners followed, lengthening out in closed victorias that exhaled their funeral scent of stale air and old leather.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着，在“马面”韩斯的指挥下，来自报社和小城的几位青年负责扶柩，他们和死者都是很熟的老朋友了。他们被烟草熏得焦黄的手指紧紧地握着棺木的把柄，慢慢地朝前行进着。送殡的亲友们紧随其后，分乘几辆封闭的四轮马车。车内散发出一股丧事的霉味和旧皮革的气味。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was raw October weather -- gray and wet. The service had been short, as a precaution against the pestilence which was everywhere. The funeral entered the cemetery. It was a pleasant place, on a hill. There was a good view of the town. As the hearse drove up, two men who had been digging the grave, moved off. The women moaned loudly when they saw the raw open ditch.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时候正是10月的天气——冷雨霏霏，灰暗且潮湿。为了预防疫病到处蔓延，葬礼的进程很短。送殡的队伍进入了墓地。这里风景宜人，高高地位于山包上面，从这里可以看到小城的全貌。灵车被抬上来的时候，原先掘墓坑的两个工人便悄然离开了。送殡的妇女们见到地上新掘出的墓穴后，又开始号啕大哭起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then the mourners got back into their carriages and were driven briskly away. There was a fast indecent hurry about their escape. The long barbarism of burial was at an end. As they drove away, Eugene peered back through the little glass in the carriage. The two grave-diggers were already returning to their work. He watched until the first shovel of dirt had been thrown into the grave. He saw the raw new graves, the sere long grasses, noted how quickly the mourning wreaths had wilted. Then he looked at the wet gray sky. He hoped it would not rain that night.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="下葬完毕以后，送葬的亲友们重新登上来时的马车，迅捷地离开了墓地，他们都恨不得马上溜之大吉。冗长、原始的葬礼总算告一段落。在他们的归途中，尤金坐在马车里，透过狭小的后车窗玻璃窥视着后面，看见那两个掘墓工又重新工作了。他一直看着，直到第一铲土扔进墓坑。他望着窗外成排的新坟，以及长长的枯草，注意到那些悼念亡灵的花圈很快就枯萎了。然后，他仰起脸望了望潮湿、灰蒙蒙的天空。他希望晚上不要下雨。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Slowly the coffin was lowered onto the bands that crossed the grave.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="棺木缓缓地放下来，搁在墓穴中的几条带子上面。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Again Eugene heard the nasal drone of the Presbyterian minister. The boy's mind fumbled at little things. Horse Hines bent ceremoniously, with a starched crackle of shirt, to throw his handful of dirt into the grave. "Ashes to ashes --" He reeled and would have fallen in if Gilbert Gant had not held him. He had been drinking. "I am the resurrection and the life --" Helen wept constantly, harshly and bitterly. "He that believeth in me --" The sobs of the women rose to sharp screams as the coffin slid down upon the bands into the earth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尤金又听见长老会牧师浓重的鼻音。他的脑海里开始搜寻着往日的琐事。“马面”韩斯庄重地弯腰行礼，浆硬的衬衫发出啪啪的响声，他朝墓穴里扔了一抔土。“土归于土——”他喊着，转过身来，幸亏吉尔勃·甘特在旁边及时把他扶住，要不然他肯定就栽进墓坑里了。他在葬礼之前喝过酒。“我就是复活，而生命——”海伦不停地哭泣着，声音悲戚而痛苦。“信赖我的人——”当棺材沿着吊带滑进墓坑底的时候，女人们的呜咽声变成了凄厉的尖号声。">查看中文翻译</div>
