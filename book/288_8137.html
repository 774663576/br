<div class="line_en">That's Harris -- he tells everybody what to do, and they do all the work. I remember that my Uncle Podger was like Harris…</div>

<div class="line_en">The following evening, we discussed what we wanted to take with us. Harris said,'Now get me a piece of paper, J., and write everything down. George, you get a pencil, and I'll make the list. '</div>

<div class="line_en">Everybody in the house had to help when Uncle Podger did a job. When they bought a picture once, Aunt Podger asked,'Now, where shall we put this?'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="浦杰叔叔要是干点什么活，一家人都得帮忙。有一次他们买了一幅画，浦杰婶婶问：“把画挂在什么地方？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">'Oh, I'll do it. Don't worry about it. I'll do it all myself,'he said. And then he took off his coat to begin. He sent one of the girls out to buy some nails, and then he sent one of the boys to tell her how big the nails ought to be. 'Now, Bill, you go and get my hammer,'he shouted. 'And bring me a ruler, Tom. And Jim, I need a ladder -- and a kitchen chair, too. Maria, you stay here to hold the light -- and Tom, come here! You can give me the picture. '</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，我来吧，你们谁也甭操心，全交给我一个人得了。”他说着，脱掉外套，就要干活。他先叫了一个女孩子去买钉子，马上又支使一个男孩子赶去告诉她钉子要多大的。“去，比尔，给我拿把锤子，”他喊着，“汤姆，去把尺子拿来。还有吉姆，我还需要个梯子——再要一把厨房里的椅子。玛丽亚，别走开，给我拿着灯照亮——还有，汤姆，快过来，你把画递给我。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then he lifted the picture up…and he dropped it. He tried to catch the glass…and he cut himslef. He looked for something to put round his finger, and he could not find anything. So he danced round the house, and he shouted at everybody.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="说着，他把画举起来，没想到一下又给掉了，他赶紧去抓玻璃，却又把手割破了。他想找点东西把手指包上，可什么也找不着。就这样，他满屋子乱蹦乱跳，冲着每一个人嚷嚷。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你瞧，”他伤心地说，“钉子又掉了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So everybody got down on the ground to look for it. At last we found the nail, but then he lost the hammer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是大家全趴在地上找。最后好不容易找到了钉子，可接着又把锤子弄没了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Half an hour later, the finger had been tied up, they had bought new glass, and everythng was ready. Uncle Podger tried again. Everybody stood round him. They were all ready to help. Two people held the chair, a third helped him to get on it, a fourth gave him a nail, and a fifth passed him the hammer. He took the nail…and he dropped it!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他花了半个小时才把手指包扎好；随后玻璃也买回来了，万事俱备。浦杰叔叔要再干一次，大家都围着他站着，随时帮忙。两个人扶着椅子，第三个人扶他上去，第四个人给他递钉子，第五个人把锤子递给他。他拿着钉子……可这回钉子又掉了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">'Where's the hammer? What did I do with the hammer? There are seven of you there, and you don't know where the hammer is!'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“锤子哪里去了？我刚才拿锤子干吗来着？你们七个人都在这儿，居然没一个知道锤子哪去了！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We found the hammer for him, but then he lost the place on the wall where he was going to put the picture. So each one of us had to get up on the chair and look for the place. And each one of us thought that it was a different place. Then Uncle Podger tried again himself. This time he fell off the chair on to the piano. His head and his body hit the piano at the same time. The music was beautiful, but Uncle Podger's words were not! Aunt Maria was not pleased. She said that she did not want the children to listen to those terrible words. She added calmly,'The next time that you are going to put a picture on the wall, please tell me. Then I can arrange to go and spend a week with my mother. '</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大家把锤子找到了给他，可是他刚才在墙上准备挂画的记号又找不着了。大家轮流爬上椅子去找那个地方，可每个人找的都不一样。浦杰叔叔自己又找了一遍，结果这次从椅子上摔下去，摔在钢琴上，整个身体，从头到脚都压在上面。音乐真是美妙，但叔叔说的话可不那么好听。玛丽亚姑姑不高兴了，她说她可不想让孩子们听见那些粗话。接着又冷冷地加了一句：“往后你再挂个画什么的，最好先告诉我一声，我好收拾东西去妈妈家住上一星期。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Uncle Podger got up and tried again, and at midnight the picture was on the wall. It was not very straight, and everyone was very tired and unhappy. Uncle Podger looked at the picture proudly and said,'You see, it was only a little job!'…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="浦杰叔叔爬上椅子，又试一次。直到半夜，画才算是挂上去了，可还不太直，一家人也都精疲力尽，满心不悦。浦杰叔叔却看着画，不无骄傲地说：“瞧瞧，小事一桩。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="再接下来，我们讨论吃的东西。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">'First, breakfast,'George began. 'We need eggs, cold meat, tea, bread and butter, of course.

<div class="line_cn" title="“首先是早餐，”乔治说，“当然了，要有鸡蛋、冷肉、茶、面包和黄油。正餐可以带上冷鸡腿、西红柿、冷肉、水果、蛋糕、巧克力……再喝点水。”说着又加了一句：“咱们带上一瓶威士忌吧——病了就用得着了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
