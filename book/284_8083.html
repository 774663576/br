<div class="line_en">She knew that she was not going to stay at the English clergyman's house where she was taken at first. She did not want to stay. The English clergyman was poor and he had five children nearly all the same age and they wore shabby clothes and were always quarreling and snatching toys from each other. Mary hated their untidy bungalow and was so disagreeable to them that after the first day or two nobody would play with her. By the second day they had given her a nickname which made her furious.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mary had liked to look at her mother from a distance and she had thought her very pretty, but as she knew very little of her she could scarcely have been expected to love her or to miss her very much when she was gone. She did not miss her at all, in fact, and as she was a self-absorbed child she gave her entire thought to herself, as she had always done. If she had been older she would no doubt have been very anxious at being left alone in the world, but she was very young, and as she had always been taken care of, she supposed she always would be. What she thought was that she would like to know if she was going to nice people, who would be polite to her and give her her own way as her Ayah and the other native servants had done.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛丽曾经喜欢远远地看着她的妈妈，觉得她很美。然而，她去世以后，不能指望玛丽爱她，想念她，因为玛丽对她的了解太少了。她压根儿不想念她，实际上，她是个专注于自己的孩子，她所有的思维都是关于自己的，一贯如此。毫无疑问，如果她年纪大一些的话，孤零零一个人被留在这世上，她一定会焦虑不安，可是她还很小，总是被人照顾，她料想一切自然照旧。她想知道的只是自己去的是不是好人家。好人家会像奶妈和其他印度仆人一样顺着她。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was Basil who thought of it first. Basil was a little boy with impudent blue eyes and a turned-up nose, and Mary hated him.

Presently he got rather interested and suddenly made a suggestion.</div>

<div class="line_en">But she thought over it a great deal afterward; and when Mrs. Crawford told her that night that she was going to sail away to England in a few days and go to her uncle, Mr. Archibald Craven, who lived at Misselthwaite Manor, she looked so stony and stubbornly uninterested that they did not know what to think about her. They tried to be kind to her, but she only turned her face away when Mrs. Crawford attempted to kiss her, and held herself stiffly when Mr. Crawford patted her shoulder.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Perhaps if her mother had carried her pretty face and her pretty manners oftener into the nursery Mary might have learned some pretty ways too.

The children call her `Mistress Mary Quite Contrary,' and though it's naughty of them, one can't help understanding it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“她真是个平庸的孩子，”克劳福太太可惜地说，“她母亲是那么一个漂亮人儿。她的风度也很美，可玛丽的举止是我见过的孩子里最乏味的。孩子们叫她‘玛丽小姐非常倔强’，虽然他们调皮了些，不过真是没法不理解。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I believe she scarcely ever looked at her,"sighed Mrs. Crawford. "When her Ayah was dead there was no one to give a thought to the little thing. Think of the servants running away and leaving her all alone in that deserted bungalow. Colonel McGrew said he nearly jumped out of his skin when he opened the door and found her standing by herself in the middle of the room."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我相信她连看都没看她几眼”，克劳福太太叹息，“她奶妈死了，就没人想到这个小东西了。想想，仆人都跑了，剩她一个人孤零零地在那个荒屋子里。麦克格鲁上校说他差点儿吓得灵魂出窍，他开门时，发现她一个人站在房间中央。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mary made the long voyage to England under the care of an officer's wife, who was taking her children to leave them in a boarding school. She was very much absorbed in her own little boy and girl, and was rather glad to hand the child over to the woman Mr. Archibald Craven sent to meet her, in London. The woman was his housekeeper at Misselthwaite Manor, and her name was Mrs. Medlock. She was a stout woman, with very red cheeks and sharp black eyes. She wore a very purple dress, a black silk mantle with jet fringe on it and a black bonnet with purple velvet flowers which stuck up and trembled when she moved her head. Mary did not like her at all, but as she very seldom liked people there was nothing remarkable in that; besides which it was very evident Mrs. Medlock did not think much of her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在一个军官妻子的照看下，玛丽长途航行去英国。军官妻子带着自己的孩子们，要把他们留在一所寄宿学校。她的心差不多都在自己的小儿女身上，所以在伦敦，她很乐意地把玛丽交给阿奇博尔德·克兰文派遣来接玛丽的妇人。妇人是米瑟斯韦特庄园的管家，名叫莫得劳克太太。她是个壮实的女人，脸蛋很红，眼睛黑而锐利。她穿着一件深紫裙子，一件黑色丝斗篷，黝黑的镶边，带着一顶黑色女帽，上面有些紫色的花朵。她的头动的时候，那些花朵就伸出来，颤动着。玛丽一点儿都不喜欢她，不过鲜有她喜欢的人，所以这不足为奇，再说莫得劳克太太显然不怎么把她放在心上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They thought Mary was not listening because she was standing a little apart from the mat the window of the private hotel they had gone to. She was watching the passing buses and cabs and people, but she heard quite well and was made very curious about her uncle and the place he lived in. What sort of a place was it, and what would he be like? What was a hunchback? She had never seen one. Perhaps there were none in India.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们以为玛丽听不见，因为玛丽离他们有一段距离。来到这个私人旅店后，她一直站在窗户那儿，看着来往的公共汽车、出租车和行人，但是她听得很清楚，开始对她叔叔和他住的地方好奇。那是一个什么样的地方，他会是什么样呢？什么是驼背？她从来没见过。可能印度一个都没有。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Since she had been living in other people's houses and had had no Ayah, she had begun to feel lonely and to think queer thoughts which were new to her. She had begun to wonder why she had never seemed to belong to anyone even when her father and mother had been alive. Other children seemed to belong to their fathers and mothers, but she had never seemed to really be anyone's little girl. She had had servants, and food and clothes, but no one had taken any notice of her. She did not know that this was because she was a disagreeable child; but then, of course, she did not know she was disagreeable. She often thought that other people were, but she did not know that she was so herself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="自从她没有奶妈，开始住到别人家里，她渐渐感到孤单，产生各种以前没有的奇怪念头。她开始疑惑为什么她好像从来不属于任何人，哪怕在父母都活着的时候。其他小孩好像都属于他们的父母亲，可是她似乎从来不是哪个人的小女孩儿。她有过仆人、食品和衣服，但是从没有谁注意过她。她不知道这是因为她脾气很坏，不过那时候，她当然没有意识到自己脾气坏。她经常觉得别人脾气坏，可是并不知道是自己脾气坏。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But Mrs. Medlock was not in the least disturbed by her and her thoughts. She was the kind of woman who would "stand no nonsense from young ones." At least, that is what she would have said if she had been asked. She had not wanted to go to London just when her sister Maria's daughter was going to be married, but she had a comfortable, well paid place as housekeeper at Misselthwaite Manor and the only way in which she could keep it was to do at once what Mr. Archibald Craven told her to do. She never dared even to ask a question.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是莫得劳克太太毫不在意玛丽和她的想法。她是那种“绝不容忍年轻人胡闹”的妇人。至少，如果有人问起，她就会这么讲。她本来不想去伦敦，她妹妹玛丽亚的女儿要结婚了，但是，米瑟斯韦特庄园的管家这份工作高薪而舒服，要保住这份工作，惟一的做法就是马上执行阿奇博尔德·克兰文先生的要求。她连问题都没敢问一个。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She thought Mrs. Medlock the most disagreeable person she had ever seen, with her common, highly colored face and her common fine bonnet. When the next day they set out on their journey to Yorkshire, she walked through the station to the railway carriage with her head up and trying to keep as far away from her as she could, because she did not want to seem to belong to her.

<div class="line_en">Mary's eyes turned toward her in spite of her intention not to seem to care. She had never thought of the hunchback's being married and she was a trifle surprised. Mrs. Medlock saw this, and as she was a talkative woman she continued with more interest. This was one way of passing some of the time, at any rate.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛丽想显得不关心，但是眼睛不由自主地转向了她。她从没想到驼背会结婚，她小小吃了一惊。莫得劳克太太看到了，她是个爱聊的人，兴致更高接着讲。这也许多多少少是个打发时间的法子吧。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It sounded like something in a book and it did not make Mary feel cheerful. A house with a hundred rooms, nearly all shut up and with their doors locked a house on the edge of a moor what so ever a moor was sounded dreary. A man with a crooked back who shut himself up also! She stared out of the window with her lips pinched together, and it seemed quite natural that the rain should have begun to pour down in gray slanting lines and splash and stream down the window panes. If the pretty wife had been alive she might have made things cheerful by being something like her own mother and by running in and out and going to parties as she had done in frocks "full of lace."But she was not there any more.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="听起来像书里的故事，这故事让玛丽觉得不愉快。一幢房子里房间上百，几乎全部关着，门上了锁——一幢牧尔边上的房子——听着阴沉。一个驼背男人，把自己也关起来！她盯着窗外，嘴唇紧缩在一起。这个地方看起来仿佛大雨是完全正常的，无数灰线下泻四溅，顺着窗玻璃往下流。如果那个美丽的妻子还活着，或许她会像她母亲一样把一切弄得有生气，她会跑出跑进，参加宴会，像她母亲一样穿着“满是花边”的长袍。可是她不在那里了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh! did she die!" she exclaimed, quite without meaning to. She had just remembered a French fairy story she had once read called "Riquet a la Houppe." It had been about a poor hunchback and a beautiful princess and it had made her suddenly sorry for Mr. Archibald Craven.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦！她死了吗！”她惊呼起来，非常不情愿地惊呼。她马上想起一个法国童话。童话里有一个穷驼背和一个美丽的公主，她突然可怜起阿奇博尔德·克兰文先生来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"She was a sweet, pretty thing and he'd have walked the world over to get her a blade of grass she wanted. Nobody thought she'd marry him, but she did, and people said she married him for his money. But she didn't -- she didn't," positively. "When she died --"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“她是个亲切、漂亮的人儿。为了找到一棵她要的草，他可以走遍全世界。没有人相信她会嫁给他，但是她嫁了。有人说她是为了他的钱。但是她不是——她不是。”口气决然。“她去世的时候——”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes, she died," Mrs. Medlock answered. "And it made him queerer than ever. He cares about nobody. He won't see people. Most of the time he goes away, and when he is at Misselthwaite he shuts himself up in the West Wing and won't let any one but Pitcher see him. Pitcher's an old fellow, but he took care of him when he was a child and he knows his ways."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，她死了，”莫得劳克太太回答，“这让他比以前更古怪。他谁也不关心。也不见人。大多数时候他出门去，在米瑟斯韦特的时候他就把自己关到西边楼里，除了皮切尔不见任何人。皮切尔是个老人，但是他从小照顾他，知道他的脾气。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And she turned her face toward the streaming panes of the window of the railway carriage and gazed out at the gray rain-storm which looked as if it would go on forever and ever. She watched it so long and steadily that the grayness grew heavier and heavier before her eyes and she fell asleep.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后，她把脸转向雨水川流的列车窗玻璃，凝视着灰蒙蒙的暴雨。暴雨好像无休无止直到永远。她定定地看了很久，那片灰色在她眼前越来越沉，越来越沉，她睡着了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You needn't expect to see him, because ten to one you won't,"said Mrs. Medlock. "And you mustn't expect that there will be people to talk to you. You'll have to play about and look after yourself. You'll be told what rooms you can go into and what rooms you're to keep out of. There's gardens enough. But when you're in the house don't go wandering and poking about. Mr. Craven won't have it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你不用指望见他，因为十有八九你见不到他，”莫得劳克太太说，“你绝对不要指望有人来和你聊天。你必须自己玩，自己照顾自己。会告诉你哪些房间可以进，哪些不能进。有很多花园。但是你在房子里的时候，不准四处乱逛，东摸西碰。克兰文先生不会容忍这个。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I shall not want to go poking about," said sour little Mary and just as suddenly as she had begun to be rather sorry for Mr. Archibald Craven she began to cease to be sorry and to think he was unpleasant enough to deserve all that had happened to him.</div>
