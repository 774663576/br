<div class="line_en">Still, Coraline realised, it had a point. She crept back into the silent house, past the closed bedroom door beyond which the other mother and the other father… What? she wondered. Slept? Waited? And then it came to her that, should she open the bedroom door, she would find it empty, or, more precisely, that it was an empty room and it would remain empty until the exact moment that she opened the door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡萝兰想呀想呀，觉得它说得挺有道理。她爬起来，回到静悄悄的屋里，走过另一个妈妈和另一个爸爸的卧室…他们在里面干什么？睡觉？等待？她突然明白了：如果推开门，她准会发现里面空空的，一个人都没有；或者，说得更准确一点儿，这是一个空房间，但就在她开门的那一眨眼工夫，里面就会变出人来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Coraline checked under her bed, looking for rats, but there was nothing there. She took off her dressing gown and slippers and climbed into bed and fell asleep with barely enough time to reflect, as she did so, on what the cat could have meant by a challenge.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡萝兰看了看床铺底下，看有没有老鼠。床下什么都没有。她脱下睡袍和拖鞋，爬上床，脑袋一沾枕头就睡着了，连想想猫说的“挑战”是什么意思都没来得及。她本来打算好好想想的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The toys in the toybox were still mostly asleep, and they stirred and muttered as she moved their box, and then they went back to sleep.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玩具盒里的玩具大多还在睡觉。她搬动它们的盒子时，玩具们动弹起来，嘟嘟囔囔的，然后又接着睡觉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Somehow, that made it easier. Coraline walked into the green and pink parody of her own bedroom. She closed the door and hauled the toybox in front of it -- it would not keep anyone out, but the noise somebody would make trying to dislodge it would wake her, she hoped.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不知为什么，想明白了这一点以后，卡萝兰反而觉得有了点把握。她走进自己那间颜色怪里怪气、绿中带红的卧室。她关上门，又用玩具盒子把门项上。这么一个盒子，当然谁都挡不住。但如果有人想进来，一碰到盒子，里面的玩具就会哗啦啦直响，把她惊醒。至少，她是这么希望的。">查看中文翻译</div>
