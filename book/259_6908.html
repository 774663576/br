<div class="line_en">The last class of my old professor's life took place once a week in his house, by a window in the study where he could watch a small hibiscus plant shed its pink leaves. The class met on Tuesdays. It began after breakfast. The subject was The Meaning of Life. It was taught from experience.</div>

<div class="line_en">No grades were given, but there were oral exams each week. You were expected to respond to questions, and you were expected to pose questions of your own. You were also required to perform physical tasks now and then, such as lifting the professor's head to a comfortable spot on the pillow or placing his glasses on the bridge of his nose. Kissing him good-bye earned you extra credit.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不打分数，也没有成绩，但每星期都有口试。你得准备口答问题，还得准备提出问题。你还要不时干一些体力活，比如把教授的头在枕头上挪动一下，或者把眼镜架到他的鼻梁上。跟他吻别能得到附加的学分。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">No books were required, yet many topics were covered, including love, work, community, family, aging, forgiveness, and, finally, death. The last lecture was brief, only a few words.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="课堂上不需要书本，但讨论的题目很多，涉及到爱情，工作，社会，年龄，原谅，以及死亡。最后一节课很简短，只有几句话。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It is the late spring of 1979, a hot, sticky Saturday afternoon. Hundreds of us sit together, side by side, in rows of wooden folding chairs on the main campus lawn. We wear blue nylon robes. We listen impatiently to long speeches. When the ceremony is over, we throw our caps in the air, and we are officially graduated from college, the senior class of Brandeis University in the city of Waltham, Massachusetts. For many of us, the curtain has just come down on childhood.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那是1979年的春末，一个炎热的星期六下午。我们几百个学生并排坐在校园大草坪的木折椅上。我们穿着蓝色的毕业礼服，不耐烦地听着冗长的讲话。当仪式结束时，我们把帽子抛向空中：马萨诸塞州沃尔瑟姆市布兰代斯大学的毕业班终于学成毕业了。对我们大多数人来说，这标志着孩提时代的结束。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Afterward, I find Morrie Schwartz, my favorite professor, and introduce him to my parents. He is a small man who takes small steps, as if a strong wind could, at any time, whisk him up into the clouds. In his graduation day robe, he looks like a cross between a biblical prophet and a Christmas elf He has sparkling blue green eyes, thinning silver hair that spills onto his forehead, big ears, a triangular nose, and tufts of graying eyebrows. Although his teeth are crooked and his lower ones are slanted back-as if someone had once punched them in-when he smiles it's as if you'd just told him the first joke on earth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="随后，我找到了莫里•施瓦茨，我最喜欢的教授，并把他介绍给了我的父母，他个子矮小，走起路来也弱不禁风似的，好像一阵大风随时都会把他拂入云端。穿着长袍的他看上去像是《圣经》里的先知，又像是圣诞夜的精灵。他有一双炯炯有神的蓝眼睛，日见稀少的白发覆在前额上，大耳朵，鹰勾鼻，还长着两撮灰白的眉毛。尽管他的牙齿长得参差不齐，下面一排还向里凹陷——好像挨过别人的拳头似的——可他笑的时候仍是那么的毫无遮拦，仿佛听到的是世界上最大的笑话。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He tells my parents how I took every class he taught. He tells them, "You have a special boy here. " Embarrassed, I look at my feet. Before we leave, I hand my professor a present, a tan briefcase with his initials on the front. I bought this the day before at a shopping mall. I didn't want to forget him. Maybe I didn't want him to forget me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他告诉我父母我在他的课上的表现。他对他们说，“你们有一个不同寻常的儿子。”我有些害羞，低下头望着自己的脚。告别时，我递给教授一件礼物：一只正面印有他名字首字母的皮包。那是前一天我在一个购物中心买的，我不想忘了他。也许我是不想让他忘了我。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Mitch, you are one of the good ones," he says, admiring the briefcase. Then he hugs me. I feel his thin arms around my back. I am taller than he is, and when he holds me, I feel awkward, older, as if I were the parent and he were the child.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title='"米奇，你是最优秀的，”他欣赏着皮包说。然后他拥抱了我。我感觉到他搂在我背上的细细的臂膀。我个子比他高，当他抱住我时，我感到很不自在，感到自己大了许多，似乎我是家长，他是孩子。'>查看中文翻译</div>
