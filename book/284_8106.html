<div class="line_en">And the secret garden bloomed and bloomed and every morning revealed new miracles. In the robin's nest there were Eggs A and the robin's mate sat upon them keeping them warm with her feathery little breast and careful wings. At first she was very nervous and the robin himself was indignantly watchful. Even Dickon did not go near the close-grown corner in those days, but waited until by the quiet working of some mysterious spell he seemed to have conveyed to the soul of the little pair that in the garden there was nothing which was not quite like themselves -- nothing which did not understand the wonderfulness of what was happening to them -- the immense, tender, terrible, heart-breaking beauty and solemnity of Eggs. If there had been one person in that garden who had not known through all his or her innermost being that if an Egg were taken away or hurt the whole world would whirl round and crash through space and come to an end -- if there had been even one who did not feel it and act accordingly there could have been no happiness even in that golden springtime air. But they all knew it and felt it and the robin and his mate knew they knew it.</div>

<div class="line_en">At first the robin watched Mary and Colin with sharp anxiety. For some mysterious reason he knew he need not watch Dickon. The first moment he set his dew-bright black eye on Dickon he knew he was not a stranger but a sort of robin without beak or feathers. He could speak robin (which is a quite distinct language not to be mistaken for any other). To speak robin to a robin is like speaking French to a Frenchman. Dickon always spoke it to the robin himself, so the queer gibberish he used when he spoke to humans did not matter in the least. The robin thought he spoke this gibberish to them because they were not intelligent enough to understand feathered speech. His movements also were robin. They never startled one by being sudden enough to seem dangerous or threatening. Any robin could understand Dickon, so his presence was not even disturbing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="刚开始知更鸟敏锐紧张地监视着玛丽和柯林。处于某种神秘的原因，它知道不必监视迪肯。它亮如露珠的黑眼睛第一次搭上迪肯，就知道他不是生人，而是某种没有喙和羽毛的知更鸟。他会说知更话（一种非常分明的语言，不与其他语言混淆）。对知更鸟说知更话犹如对法国人说法国话。迪肯对知更鸟总说知更话，所以它对人说话时用的莫名其妙的叽里咕噜完全无关紧要。知更鸟想，它对他们说这种叽里咕噜是因为他们不够聪明，不懂羽毛族的讲话。他的动作也是知更鸟式的。它们从不突然动作显得危险或者威胁，来吓别人。任何知更鸟都能明白迪肯，所以他的存在甚至连困扰都不算。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But at the outset it seemed necessary to be on guard against the other two. In the first place the boy creature did not come into the garden on his legs. He was pushed in on a thing with wheels and the skins of wild animals were thrown over him. That in itself was doubtful. Then when he began to stand up and move about he did it in a queer unaccustomed way and the others seemed to have to help him. The robin used to secrete himself in a bush and watch this anxiously, his head tilted first on one side and then on the other. He thought that the slow movements might mean that he was preparing to pounce, as cats do. When cats are preparing to pounce they creep over the ground very slowly. The robin talked this over with his mate a great deal for a few days but after that he decided not to speak of the subject because her terror was so great that he was afraid it might be injurious to the Eggs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是开始看起来有必要警觉其他两个。首先那个男孩动物不是靠自己的腿走进花园的。他是坐在一个带轮子的东西上被推进来的，野生动物的皮毛扔在他身上。这件事本身就令人怀疑。然后他开始站起来四处走动，他的方式奇怪、不寻常，其他人好像在帮助他。知更鸟过去常常藏在灌木丛里紧张地监视，它的头先这边一偏，又那边一偏。它以为缓慢的动作可能意味着它准备要猛扑，就像猫那样。猫准备猛扑地时候，它们非常缓慢地伏到地上。知更鸟和它媳妇把这事仔细说上了好几天，可是后来它决定不谈这个话题了，因为她害怕得那么厉害，它担心会伤害到蛋。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When the boy began to walk by himself and even to move more quickly it was an immense relief. But for a long time -- or it seemed a long time to the robin -- he was a source of some anxiety. He did not act as the other humans did. He seemed very fond of walking but he had a way of sitting or lying down for a while and then getting up in a disconcerting manner to begin again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="等男孩开始自己走，移动得更快，是个无比的解脱。可是很长一段时间里——对知更鸟显得很长——他是紧张忧虑的源头。他和其他人类举止不同。他看来很喜欢走路，可是，他有一种习惯，坐下、躺下一阵子然后让人慌乱地站起立重新开始。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One day the robin remembered that when he himself had been made to learn to fly by his parents he had done much the same sort of thing. He had taken short flights of a few yards and then had been obliged to rest. So it occurred to him that this boy was learning to fly -- or rather to walk. He mentioned this to his mate and when he told her that the Eggs would probably conduct themselves in the same way after they were fledged she was quite comforted and even became eagerly interested and derived great pleasure from watching the boy over the edge of her nest -- though she always thought that the Eggs would be much cleverer and learn more quickly. But then she said indulgently that humans were always more clumsy and slow than Eggs and most of them never seemed really to learn to fly at all. You never met them in the air or on tree-tops.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一天知更鸟记起来，它自己曾经被父母教着学飞，它做了非常相同的事。它飞出几码，然后被迫休息。于是它想起来这个男孩在学飞——更像学走。它向它媳妇提起这事，告诉她蛋被照料到羽毛丰满以后，很可能要执行情况一样的事，她大为安慰，甚至变得迫切地感兴趣，从她的巢沿上观察男孩，获得很大的乐趣——尽管她一直想蛋会即令得多，学得快得多。不过接着她又极为体贴地说，人类总是比蛋更笨拙些、慢些，它们大多数看来从来没有真正学会飞。你从来没有在空中、树梢遇到它们。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After a while the boy began to move about as the others did, but all three of the children at times did unusual things. They would stand under the trees and move their arms and legs and heads about in a way which was neither walking nor running nor sitting down. They went through these movements at intervals every day and the robin was never able to explain to his mate what they were doing or trying to do. He could only say that he was sure that the Eggs would never flap about in such a manner; but as the boy who could speak robin so fluently was doing the thing with them, birds could be quite sure that the actions were not of a dangerous nature. Of course neither the robin nor his mate had ever heard of the champion wrestler, Bob Haworth, and his exercises for making the muscles stand out like lumps. Robins are not like human beings; their muscles are always exercised from the first and so they develop themselves in a natural manner. If you have to fly about to find every meal you eat, your muscles do not become atrophied.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="过了一段，男孩开始和其他人一样到处走动，可是这时三个孩子都开始做出不寻常的事。他们会站在树下，到处移动他们的胳膊、腿、头，既不是走，也不是跑，也不是坐。他们每天间歇时过一遍这些动作，知更鸟从未能够向它媳妇解释他们在干什么，或者想干什么。它只能确信它们的蛋不会这样滴溜溜转，不过，既然那个能流利地讲知更话的男孩也在做，鸟儿们可以确信这一行为不带危险性。当然，知更鸟和它媳妇儿都没有听说过摔跤冠军鲍勃·豪华思，还有他的训练，让肌肉像包一样鼓起来。知更鸟不像人类，它们的肌肉总是一开始就得到锻炼，所以它们以自然的方式生长。如果你必须到处飞着去找你吃的每顿饭，你的肌肉不会萎缩（萎缩的意思是失去力气直到力不从心）。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When the boy was walking and running about and digging and weeding like the others, the nest in the corner was brooded over by a great peace and content. Fears for the Eggs became things of the past. Knowing that your Eggs were as safe as if they were locked in a bank vault and the fact that you could watch so many curious things going on made setting a most entertaining occupation. On wet days the Eggs' mother sometimes felt even a little dull because the children did not come into the garden.</div>
