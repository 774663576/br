<div class="line_en">Ralph lay in a covert, wondering about his wounds. The bruised flesh was inches in diameter over his right ribs, with a swollen and bloody scar where the spear had hit him. His hair was full of dirt and tapped like the tendrils of a creeper. All over he was scratched and bruised from his flight through the forest. By the time his breathing was normal again, he had worked out that bathing these injuries would have to wait. How could you listen for naked feet if you were splashing in water? How could you be safe by the little stream or on the open beach?</div>

<div class="line_en">Ralph listened. He was not really far from the Castle Rock, and during the first panic he had thought he heard sounds of pursuit. But the hunters had only sneaked into the fringes of the greenery, retrieving spears perhaps, and then had rushed back to the sunny rock as if terrified of the darkness under the leaves. He had even glimpsed one of them, striped brown, black, and red, and had judged that it was Bill. But really, thought Ralph, this was not Bill. This was a savage whose image refused to blend with that ancient picture of a boy in shorts and shirt.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="拉尔夫侧耳倾听。其实他离城堡岩并不远，在先前的惊慌失措之中他曾以为听到了追逐的响声。但是猎手们仅仅偷偷地跑到了绿树丛的边缘，也许是为了捡回长矛，随后都一窝蜂地退回到阳光照射的城堡岩上，好像他们也被叶丛下的黑暗吓坏了似的。拉尔夫还瞥见了其中一个，涂着一道道褐色、黑色和红色的条纹，他判断那是比尔。但事实上这不是比尔，拉尔夫想。这是一个野蛮人，他的外貌跟过去的比尔——一个穿着衬衫和短裤的孩子——的形象很难一致起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The afternoon died away; the circular spots of sunlight moved steadily over green fronds and brown fiber but no sound came from behind the rock. At last Ralph wormed out of the ferns and sneaked forward to the edge of that impenetrable thicket that fronted the neck of land. He peered with elaborate caution between branches at the edge and could see Robert sitting on guard at the top of the cliff. He held a spear in his left hand and was tossing up a pebble and catching it again with the right. Behind him a column of smoke rose thickly, so that Ralph's nostrils flared and his mouth dribbled. He wiped his nose and mouth with the back of his hand and for the first time since the morning felt hungry. The tribe must be sitting round the gutted pig, watching the fat ooze and burn among the ashes. They would be intent.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="下午慢慢地过去了；太阳的圆光斑渐渐地移上了绿色的棕榈叶丛和褐色的树纤上，但是城堡岩的后面并没有什么声音传过来。最后拉尔夫扭动着身子钻出了羊齿草丛，偷偷地爬到了隘口前面那难以逾越的乱丛棵子的边上。他透过树枝十分小心地窥视，看见罗伯特坐在悬崖顶上放哨。罗伯特左手持着长矛，右手把一块卵石往上抛起又接住，再抛起再接住。在罗伯特的背后，一股浓烟冉冉上升，拉尔夫鼻孔张得老大，嘴里馋涎欲滴。他用手背擦擦鼻子和嘴巴。这时他觉得饥肠辘辘，这也是早晨以来他第一次感到肚子饿。那伙人一定围着开胸剖膛的野猪席地而坐，看着脂油熔化着滴在灰烬上嗞嗞而燃。他们一定很聚精会神。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Another figure, an unrecognizable one, appeared by Robert and gave him something, then turned and went back behind the rock. Robert laid his spear on the rock beside him and began to gnaw between his raised hands. So the feast was beginning and the watchman had been given his portion.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="另一个认不出是谁的人影出现在罗伯特身旁，给了他什么东西，随后转身走开，隐没在岩石背后。罗伯特把长矛放在靠身边的岩石上，双手抬起，把两只手之间的东西放在嘴里咬。吃喝开始了，看守者也分得了一份。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ralph saw that for the time being he was safe. He limped away through the fruit trees, drawn by the thought of the poor food yet bitter when he remembered the feast. Feast today, and then tomorrow…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="拉尔夫晓得他暂时没有危险，就一瘸一拐地穿过了野果树林，想随便弄点蹩脚的食物来吃；而当他想到山上的人有许多东西吃，不由得一阵心酸。他们今天有的吃，那么明天……">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He argued unconvincingly that they would let him alone, perhaps even make an outlaw of him. But then the fatal unreasoning knowledge came to him again. The breaking of the conch and the deaths of Piggy and Simon lay over the island like a vapor. These painted savages would go further and further. Then there was that indefinable connection between himself and Jack; who therefore would never let him alone; never.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他在心里反反复复地想，但是想不透他们是不是会把他丢在一边不管；或许会把他当作一个放逐者。但是那决定命运的看法不假思索地回到了他身上。海螺被砸得粉碎，还有猪崽子和西蒙的死，像烟雾笼罩在岛的上空。这些脸上涂得五颜六色的野蛮人会越走越远。其次还有他自己和杰克之间讲不清楚的关系；因此杰克是决不会让他太平的；决不会的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The slanting sticks of sunlight were lost among the branches. At length he came to a clearing in the forest where rock prevented vegetation from growing. Now it was a pool of shadows and Ralph nearly flung himself behind a tree when he saw something standing in the center; but then he saw that the white face was bone and that the pig's skull grinned at him from the top of a stick. He walked slowly into the middle of the clearing and looked steadily at the skull that gleamed as white as ever the conch had done and seemed to jeer at him cynically. An inquisitive ant was busy in one of the eye sockets but otherwise the thing was lifeless.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="倾斜的阳光消失在密密的树枝当中。他最后来到了一块林中空地，那儿的岩石使得植物无法生长。此时空地上满是阴影，拉尔夫一眼看到空地中间有什么东西站着，赶忙闪到一棵树后；后来他看清了那白面孔只是个骨头架子，插在一根木棒上头的一只猪头正在朝他露齿而笑，就慢慢地走进空地中央，盯着那猪头看。猪头像先前的海螺那样地闪着微微的白光，似乎在讥笑他，挖苦他。一只好奇的蚂蚁在一只眼窟窿里忙碌，除此以外猪头毫无生气。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When he had eaten he went toward the beach. The sunlight was slanting now into the palms by the wrecked shelter. There was the platform and the pool. The best thing to do was to ignore this leaden feeling about the heart and rely on their common sense, their daylight sanity. Now that the tribe had eaten, the thing to do was to try again. And anyway, he couldn't stay here all night in an empty shelter by the deserted platform. His flesh crept and he shivered in the evening sun. No fire; no smoke; no rescue. He turned and limped away through the forest toward Jack's end of the island.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吃完以后，拉尔夫朝海滩走去。此刻阳光斜射到塌掉了的窝棚旁边的棕榈树林里。那儿有平台和水潭。现在最好不要去理睬心里那种沉闷的感觉，相信他们也有常识，相信他们白天神志会正常。既然那一伙人已吃完了，那就再试试看吧。无论如何，他总不能整夜呆在这儿，呆在荒无人影的平台边空荡荡的窝棚里。在落日的余晖中，他感到自己汗毛直竖，浑身打战。没有火，没有烟，也没有人来救。他转过身去，一瘸一拐地穿越森林，朝岛上杰克他们那一头走去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The skull regarded Ralph like one who knows all the answers and won't tell. A sick fear and rage swept him. Fiercely he hit out at the filthy thing in front of him that bobbed like a toy and came back, still grinning into his face, so that he lashed and cried out in loathing. Then he was licking his bruised knuckles and looking at the bare stick, while the skull lay in two pieces, its grin now six feet across. He wrenched the quivering stick from the crack and held it as a spear between him and the white pieces. Then he backed away, keeping his face to the skull that lay grinning at the sky.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="猪头看着拉尔夫，好像它知道一切答案却不肯讲似的。拉尔夫感到一种令人恶心的恐惧和愤怒。他狠狠地挥拳猛击面前这丑陋的东西，它像玩具似的摇了摇，又晃了回来，仍然朝着他龇牙咧嘴地笑，于是他边打边大声咒骂。随后，他舔舔自己青肿的指关节，看着光秃秃的木棒，猪头骨一摔两爿，在六英尺外还在痴笑。拉尔夫一阵猛扭，把颤动着的木棒从岩缝里拔了出来，他把木棒拿在手里，置于他自己和白色的碎头盖骨之间，就像是拿着一根长矛。然后他往后退，面孔始终盯着躺在地上朝天痴笑的猪头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Little prickles of sensation ran up and down his back. He stood, the skull about on a level with his face, and held up his hair with two hands. The teeth grinned, the empty sockets seemed to hold his gaze masterfully and without effort.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="拉尔夫觉得背上好像有针在上上下下地刺着。他站在那儿，双手撩起自己的头发，猪头跟他的脸大致处于同一高度。它龇牙咧嘴地笑着，两只眼窟窿仿佛毫不费力地巧妙地吸引住了他的目光。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="当苍白的光从天际消失，夜幕完全降临以后，拉尔夫又回到了城堡岩前面的乱丛棵子里。他从树丛中向外窥视，看见岩石高处仍有人守着，不知是谁拿着长矛在上面值勤。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他跪在黑影当中，痛苦地感到自己形影相吊，十分孤单。他们确实是一群野蛮人；但他们总还是人吧，一种潜伏的、对深沉黑夜的恐惧正在袭来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ralph moaned faintly. Tired though he was, he could not relax and fall into a well of sleep for fear of the tribe. Might it not be possible to walk boldly into the fort, say -- "I've got pax," laugh lightly and sleep among the others? Pretend they were still boys, schoolboys who had said, "Sir, yes, Sir"-- and worn caps? Daylight might have answered yes; but darkness and the horrors of death said no. Lying there in the darkness, he knew he was an outcast.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="拉尔夫无力地悲叹着。他虽然很累了，但是由于害怕那一伙人，还是无法宽下心来，倒头酣睡一觉。要这样做可能不行了：勇敢地走进他们占据的堡垒，对他们说——“我不跟你们吵了，”并微微一笑，在他们当中睡下去，把他们当作一群孩子，当作一群戴着帽子，过去老说“先生，是，先生”的学生吧？大白天对此的回答也许是肯定的；然而黑夜和对死的恐怖对此的回答却相反。拉尔夫躺在一片漆黑之中，他知道自己无处可归。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A noise nearer at hand made him quiver. Savages were clambering up the Castle Rock, right up to the top, and he could hear voices. He sneaked forward a few yards and saw the shape at the top of the rock change and enlarge. There were only two boys on the island who moved or talked like that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="听到从离他更近处的一个声响，拉尔夫直哆嗦。野蛮人正在往城堡岩上爬，一直往顶上去，拉尔夫听得到各种说话声音。他偷偷地朝前爬了几码，看到岩石顶上的人形变了样，并且变大了。岛上只有两个孩子会那样地移动，那样地说话。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ralph edged forward, feeling his way over the uneven surface as though he were blind. There were miles of vague water at his right and the restless ocean lay under his left hand, as awful as the shaft of a pit. Every minute the water breathed round the death rock and flowered into a field of whiteness. Ralph crawled until he found the ledge of the entry in his grasp. The lookouts were immediately above him and he could see the end of a spear projecting over the rock.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="拉尔夫慢慢地向前移动，像瞎子似的摸索着高低不平的地面前进。他的右手方向是一片模模糊糊的海水，他的左手下方横卧着骚动不安的大海，从上面往下看去，就像是看着一个竖井的井底，令人生畏。海水不停地围绕着那块死亡礁石起伏着，并汇成白茫茫的一片。拉尔夫慢慢地爬着，终于用手抓住了入口处的架状岩石。岗哨就在他的头上，他看得见从岩石上露出的矛尖。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was no reply. To carry he must speak louder; and this would rouse those striped and inimical creatures from their feasting by the fire.

<div class="line_en">Then he tensed again. There were voices raised on the top of the Castle Rock. Samneric were arguing with someone. But the ferns and the grass were near. That was the place to be in, hidden, and next to the thicket that would serve for tomorrow's hideout.

<div class="line_en">He squatted down in the tall grass, remembered the meat that Sam had given him, and began to tear at it ravenously. While he was eating, he heard fresh noises -- cries of pain from Samneric, cries of panic, angry voices. What did it mean? Someone besides himself was in trouble, for at least one of the twins was catching it. Then the voices passed away down the rock and he ceased to think of them. He felt with his hands and found cool, delicate fronds backed against the thicket. Here then was the night's lair. At first light he would creep into the thicket, squeeze between the twisted stems, ensconce himself so deep that only a crawler like himself could come through, and that crawler would be jabbed. There he would sit, and the search would pass him by, and the cordon waver on, ululating along the island, and he would be free.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="拉尔夫蹲坐在高高的野草中，记起了萨姆给他的一块肉，就贪婪地撕咬起来。他正吃着，听到有一种新的喧哗声——萨姆埃里克发出痛苦的叫声，惊恐的哭喊，再加上愤怒的话语。这意味着什么呢？除了他以外，至少双胞胎中的一个正碰上了麻烦。随后，说话声消失在岩石下面，他也不再去想到它了。拉尔夫用手摸索着，碰到了背靠着乱丛棵子的、冷冷的、细嫩的蕨类叶丛。那么这儿就是夜里藏身的地方了。晨曦初露他就爬进乱丛棵子，挤在杂树乱枝之中，把自己隐蔽得深深的，只有像他一样地爬才能爬进来；而他就会对这样爬进来的人狠狠刺去。他将坐在那儿，搜索的人会擦身而过，封锁线朝前移动，沿岛发出呜呜的报警声，可他仍然不会被抓住。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He was awake before his eyes were open, listening to a noise that was near. He opened an eye, found the mold an inch or so from his face and his fingers gripped into it, light filtering between the fronds of fern. He had just time to realize that the age-long nightmares of falling and death were past and that the morning was come, when he heard the sound again. It was an ululation over by the seashore -- and now the next savage answered and the next. The cry swept by him across the narrow end of the island from sea to lagoon, like the cry of a flying bird. He took no time to consider but grabbed his sharp stick and wriggled back among the ferns. Within seconds he was worming his way into the thicket; but not before he had glimpsed the legs of a savage coming toward him. The ferns were thumped and beaten and he heard legs moving in the long grass. The savage, whoever he was, ululated twice; and the cry was repeated in both directions, then died away. Ralph crouched still, tangled in the ferns, and for a time he heard nothing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="拉尔夫醒了，他闭着眼睛，倾听着近旁的喧闹声。他睁开一只眼睛，发现松软的泥土几乎贴着脸庞，便把手指挖进泥土中去。亮光从羊齿草的叶丛中筛漏进来，他又听到了声音，这才意识到漫长的下坠与死亡的恶梦已经过去，早晨来临了。喧闹声是在海岸边传过来的一种呜呜声——此刻又一个野蛮人在答应，又一个野蛮人在答应。喊声像飞鸟的惊鸣，越过他、越过岛的狭窄的一头，从大海扫向环礁湖。他来不及多加考虑，只是抓起他削尖了的木棒，扭动着身子爬回到羊齿草丛中。几秒钟之内他就开始往乱丛棵子爬去；但还没爬进乱丛棵子，他就瞥见两条腿，一个野蛮人正朝他走来。羊齿草丛被重重地踩踏着，被踩倒在地，他听到有人在长长的野草中走动。一个野蛮人，不知是哪一个，呜呜地叫了两次；喊叫声在两个方向上重复着，随后又消失了。拉尔夫仍蹲伏着，缠在矮树丛之中，一时他什么也没听见。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At last he examined the thicket itself. Certainly no one could attack him here -- and moreover he had a stroke of luck. The great rock that had killed Piggy had bounded into this thicket and bounced there, right in the center, making a smashed space a few feet in extent each way. When Ralph had wriggled into this he felt secure, and clever. He sat down carefully among the smashed stems and waited for the hunt to pass. Looking up between the leaves he caught a glimpse of something red. That must be the top of the Castle Rock, distant and unmenacing. He composed himself triumphantly, to hear the sounds of the hunt dying away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后他仔细察看这个矮树丛。毫无疑问，没人能在这儿攻击他——而且他还有点运气。砸死猪崽子的那块巨石蹦进了这个乱丛棵子，弹到了正中央，砸出一个几英尺见方的空地。他一钻到这儿就感到安全，感到灵便起来。他小心地坐到被砸断的枝干中，等待着搜寻者经过。他穿过叶丛抬头仰望，瞥见一样红色的东西。那准是城堡岩的顶部，离得很远，对他不再具有威胁。他怀着胜利的喜悦使自己镇静下来，听着搜索的声音慢慢消逝。">查看中文翻译</div>

There was only one other rock up there that they might conceivably move; but that was half as big as a cottage, big as a car, a tank.

<div class="line_en">Once more the invisible group sniggered. He heard a curious trickling sound and then a louder crepitation as if someone were unwrapping great sheets of cellophane.

<div class="line_en">He wormed his way through the thicket toward the forest, keeping as far as possible beneath the smoke. Presently he saw open space, and the green leaves of the edge of the thicket. A smallish savage was standing between him and the rest of the forest, a savage striped red and white, and carrying a spear. He was coughing and smearing the paint about his eyes with the back of his hand as he tried to see through the increasing smoke. Ralph launched himself like a cat; stabbed, snarling, with the spear, and the savage doubled up. There was a shout from beyond the thicket and then Ralph was running with the swiftness of fear through the undergrowth. He came to a pig-run, followed it for perhaps a hundred yards, and then swerved off. Behind him the ululation swept across the island once more and a single voice shouted three times. He guessed that was the signal to advance and sped away again, till his chest was like fire. Then he flung himself down under a bush and waited for a moment till his breathing steadied. He passed his tongue tentatively over his teeth and lips and heard far off the ululation of the pursuers.</div>

<div class="line_en">Another double cry at the same distance gave him a clue to their plan. Any savage balked in the forest would utter the double shout and hold up the line till he was free again. That way they might hope to keep the cordon unbroken right across the island. Ralph thought of the boar that had broken through them with such ease. If necessary, when the chase came too close, he could charge the cordon while it was still thin, burst through, and run back. But run back where? The cordon would turn and sweep again. Sooner or later he would have to sleep or eat -- and then he would awaken with hands clawing at him; and the hunt would become a running down.</div>

<div class="line_en">And there again, shrill and inevitable, was the ululation sweeping across the island. At that sound he shied like a horse among the creepers and ran once more till he was panting. He flung himself down by some ferns. The tree, or the charge?

<div class="line_en">At last he found what seemed to him the right place, though the decision was desperate. Here, bushes and a wild tangle of creeper made a mat that kept out all the light of the sun.

If you wormed into the middle of that you would be five yards from the edge, and hidden, unless the savage chose to lie down and look for you; and even then, you would be in darkness -- and if the worst happened and he saw you, then you had a chance to burst out at him, fling the whole line out of step and double back.</div>

<div class="line_en">A herd of pigs came squealing out of the greenery behind the savage and rushed away into the forest. Birds were screaming, mice shrieking, and a little hopping thing came under the mat and cowered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从野蛮人背后的绿树丛中蹿出了一群吱喳乱叫的野猪，一下子就冲进了森林。鸟儿在喳喳惊鸣，老鼠在吱吱尖叫，一个双足跳的小动物也钻到了“毯子”底下，吓得发抖。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The savage moved forward so that you could only see him from the waist down. That was the butt of his spear. Now you could see him from the knee down. Don't scream.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这野蛮人朝前走着，所以只看得见他腰以下的部分。那是他的矛柄。现在你能看得见他膝盖以下的部分了。可别吱声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The ululation spread from shore to shore. The savage knelt down by the edge of the thicket, and there were lights flickering in the forest behind him. You could see a knee disturb the mold. Now the other. Two hands. A spear.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="呜呜的叫声从这块海岸传向那块海岸。这野蛮人在乱丛棵子的边上跪下来，在他背后的森林里，有闪烁摇曳的光。看得出一只膝盖碰动了松软的泥土，接着又是一只膝盖，两只手，一根长矛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Perhaps he can hear my heart over the noises of the fire. Don't scream. Get ready.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="也许他能越过大火的嘈杂声听到我的心跳吧。别吱声。准备好。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Five yards away the savage stopped, standing right by the thicket, and cried out. Ralph drew his feet up and crouched. The stake was in his hands, the stake sharpened at both ends, the stake that vibrated so wildly, that grew long, short, light, heavy, light again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="野蛮人停在五码开外，正站在乱丛棵子旁边，又大叫起来。拉尔夫把脚曲起来，蜷缩着。手里拿着两头尖的标桩，标桩颤抖得很厉害，仿佛一会儿长，一会儿短，一会儿轻，一会儿重，一会儿又轻。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The savage peered into the obscurity beneath the thicket. You could tell that he saw light on this side and on that, but not in the middle -- there. In the middle was a blob of dark and the savage wrinkled up his face, trying to decipher the darkness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="野蛮人往乱丛棵子下面的阴暗处窥探。可以判断得出他在这一边和那一边都看见有光线，而在当中——也就是拉尔夫藏身处看不见光线。当中是一团漆黑，野蛮人皱起额头，想弄清黑暗中有什么东西。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ralph screamed, a scream of fright and anger and desperation. His legs straightened, the screams became continuous and foaming. He shot forward, burst the thicket, was in the open, screaming, snarling, bloody. He swung the stake and the savage tumbled over; but there were others coming toward him, crying out. He swerved as a spear flew past and then was silent, running. All at once the lights flickering ahead of him merged together, the roar of the forest rose to thunder and a tall bush directly in his path burst into a great fan-shaped flame. He swung to the right, running desperately fast, with the heat beating on his left side and the fire racing forward like a tide. The ululation rose behind him and spread along, a series of short sharp cries, the sighting call. A brown figure showed up at his right and fell away. They were all running, all crying out madly. He could hear them crashing in the undergrowth and on the left was the hot, bright thunder of the fire. He forgot his wounds, his hunger and thirst, and became fear; hopeless fear on flying feet, rushing through the forest toward the open beach. Spots jumped before his eyes and turned into red circles that expanded quickly till they passed out of sight. Below him someone's legs were getting tired and the desperate ululation advanced like a jagged fringe of menace and was almost overhead.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="拉尔夫一声惊叫。这是一种恐怖的、愤怒的、绝望的惊叫，他绷直了腿，惊叫声拖长了，并变得凶了。他朝前一弹，冲出了乱丛棵子，在林间空地上狂吼乱嗥。他挥舞标桩，野蛮人被打翻在地；然而还有别的野蛮人在大叫大嚷地朝他冲来。一枝长矛朝拉尔夫飞来，他忙侧身让过，也不再喊叫，赶快逃开去。突然，在他面前闪烁着的一道道光线混合成一片，森林的吼叫变成雷鸣般的响声，挡在他正前面路上的一簇高大的灌木猛地烧将起来，熊熊的火焰形状像一把巨大的扇子。他朝右一折，拼命地飞跑，在他左面，热浪逼人，火焰像一股潮流滚滚向前。他的身后又响起了呜呜的叫声，还有一连串短促而尖响的叫声——这是表示看到了猎物的招呼声——在传扬开来。在他的右边出现了一个褐色的人影，又消失了。他们全在奔跑，在发疯似的喊叫。他听得见他们在下层林丛中咔嚓咔嚓的脚步声；而在他左边是发出很大声响的熊熊烈火，热气腾腾。他忘掉了自己的创伤和饥渴，心惊胆战；一面在飞快地逃跑，一面充满了绝望的恐惧，他冲过森林，直奔开阔的海滩。光斑在他眼前闪烁，并变成了一个个红色的圆圈，这些圆圈飞快地扩展着，然后又消失了。在他的下面，那双腿似乎是别人的了，变得越来越沉重，令人绝望的呜呜叫声就像充满威胁的一排排锯齿朝前推进，几乎就要落到头顶上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He stumbled over a root and the cry that pursued him rose even higher. He saw a shelter burst into flames and the fire flapped at his right shoulder and there was the glitter of water. Then he was down, rolling over and over in the warm sand, crouching with arm to ward off, trying to cry for mercy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他被一个树根绊倒在地，追逐的喊叫声更响了。他看到一座窝棚烧成一团，他的右肩方向火焰在噼啪作响，还看见闪闪发亮的海水。然后他翻了下去，在暖乎乎的沙滩上滚呀滚呀，蜷曲着身子，双臂举起保护头部，想要大声讨饶。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He staggered to his feet, tensed for more terrors, and looked up at a huge peaked cap. It was a white-topped cap, and above the green shade of the peak was a crown, an anchor, gold foliage. He saw white drill, epaulettes, a revolver, a row of gilt buttons down the front of a uniform.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他摇摇晃晃地站起来，紧张地准备承受更进一步的种种恐怖，抬头一看，只见一顶大盖帽。那帽顶是白色的，绿色帽檐上有王冠、海锚和金色的叶饰。他看到了白斜纹布军服，肩章，左轮手枪，制服上一排从上到下的镀金的钮扣。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A naval officer stood on the sand, looking down at Ralph in wary astonishment. On the beach behind him was a cutter, her bows hauled up and held by two ratings. In the stern-sheets another rating held a sub-machine gun.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="站在沙滩上的是一个海军军官，吃惊而又警惕地俯视着拉尔夫。在军官后面的海滩边上有一艘小汽艇，艇首被拖上了海滩，由两个海军士兵拉着。艇尾部还有个士兵持着一挺轻机枪。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ralph looked at him dumbly. For a moment he had a fleeting picture of the strange glamour that had once invested the beaches. But the island was scorched up like dead wood -- Simon was dead -- and Jack had… The tears began to flow and sobs shook him. He gave himself up to them now for the first time on the island; great, shuddering spasms of grief that seemed to wrench his whole body. His voice rose under the black smoke before the burning wreckage of the island; and infected by that emotion, the other little boys began to shake and sob too. And in the middle of them, with filthy body, matted hair, and unwiped nose, Ralph wept for the end of innocence, the darkness of man's heart, and the fall through the air of the true, wise friend called Piggy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="拉尔夫木然地看着他。一时他脑海里闪过一幅图画，一幅那曾经给海滩蒙上过神奇魅力的图画。然而现在这岛像枯树一样被烧焦了——西蒙死了——杰克已经……拉尔夫止不住热泪滚滚，全身抽搐地呜咽起来。这是他上岛以来第一次尽情地哭；巨大的悲痛使他一阵阵地抽搐，似乎把他整个身子扭成一团。头上黑烟翻滚，拉尔夫面对着正被烧毁的岛屿，越哭越响；别的小孩受到这种情感的影响，也颤抖着抽泣起来。拉尔夫在这伙孩子当中，肮脏不堪，蓬头散发，连鼻子都未擦擦；他失声痛哭：为童心的泯灭和人性的黑暗而悲泣，为忠实而有头脑的朋友猪崽子坠落惨死而悲泣。">查看中文翻译</div>
