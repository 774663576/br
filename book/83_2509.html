<div class="line_en">He pushed the door shut behind him and put that hand in the lap-seamed pocket of his coat and left the thumb outside to glisten in the rather dim light of the room. He smiled at Carmen. He had a nice easy smile. She licked her lips and stared at him. The fear went out of her face. She smiled back.</div>

<div class="line_en">He stood there politely, one hand touching the door at his back, the other holding the gray hat and flapping it gently against his thigh. He looked hard, not the hardness of the tough guy. More like the hardness of a well-weathered horseman. But he was no horseman. He was Eddie Mars.</div>

<div class="line_en">He was a gray man, all gray, except for his polished black shoes and two scarlet diamonds in his gray satin tie that looked like the diamonds on roulette layouts. His shirt was gray and his double-breasted suit of soft, beautifully cut flannel. Seeing Carmen he took a gray hat off and his hair underneath it was gray and as fine as if it had been sifted through gauze. His thick gray eyebrows had that indefinably sporty look. He had a long chin, a nose with a hook to it, thoughtful gray eyes that had a slanted look because the fold of skin over his upper lid came down over the corner of the lid itself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="是个穿灰色衣服的男子，一身灰，除了那双精致的黑皮鞋，还有灰色绸缎领带上那两颗犹如赌盘装饰的鲜红钻石。他的衬衫是灰色的，外面套着的双排扣法兰绒上装质地柔软、剪裁漂亮。看到卡门，他便摘下那顶灰色帽子。他的头发柔顺得仿佛用网纱筛过。他浓密的灰色眉毛透着股难以名状的放荡不羁。他长下巴，鹰钩鼻，那双深邃的眼睛总像在斜眼看人，其实是上眼睑的皮肤褶皱垂下来盖住了眼角的缘故。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“那太遗憾了。”他的话意味深长。他灰色的双眸闪闪亮，而当我走过他身旁去开门的时候，他的眼神陡然露出寒光。他用随意的口气补了一句：“这姑娘可以走了。我想同你稍微聊两句，当兵的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Carmen made a sound at my side and bolted through the door. Her steps faded rapidly downhill. I hadn't seen her car, so she must have left it down below. I started to say: "What the hell --!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡门在我身旁嘟囔了一声，飞快地窜出门外。她向山下奔去，脚步声旋即消失了。我没看到她的车，看来准是停在下面了。我开口道：“到底他妈的——”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He looked at a couple of books, grunted, went on around the desk and stood in front of the little totem pole with the camera eye. He studied it, dropped his glance to the floor in front of it. He moved the small rug with his foot, then bent swiftly, his body tense. He went down on the floor with one gray knee. The desk hid him from me partly. There was a sharp exclamation and he came up again. His arm flashed under his coat and a black Luger appeared in his hand. He held it in long brown fingers, not pointing it at me, not pointing it at anything.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他看了一眼那几本书，咕哝了两声，继续向前绕过书桌，在那根装有摄像头的小图腾柱前站定。端详完那柱子，他的目光落到了它前面的地板上。他伸脚挪开那块小地毯，敏捷地弯下腰，身体紧紧绷着。他趴了下去，单膝跪地。我看他的视线被书桌挡住了一部分。一声尖叫传来，他又站起了身。只见他的臂膀迅速探进外套里，掏出一把黑色的卢格尔手枪[1]来。他细长的棕色手指握着枪，枪口既没有对准我，也没有对准任何东西。【[1]Luger：一种德国半自动手枪。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Only when necessary, soldier." He wasn't looking at me any more. He was walking around the room, frowning, not paying any attention to me. I looked out above the broken pane of the front window. The top of a car showed over the hedge. Its motor idled.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“只在有必要的时候才厉害一把，当兵的。”他不再看我。他在屋里走来走去，眉头紧锁，注意力根本没在我身上。我透过正面窗户残碎的玻璃朝屋外望去。树障上露出一个车顶。马达在空转。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Eddie Mars found the purple flagon and the two gold-veined glasses on the desk. He sniffed at one of the glasses, then at the flagon. A disgusted smile wrinkled his lips. "The lousy pimp," he said tonelessly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="艾迪·马尔斯看到了那只大肚瓶和桌上那对金丝玻璃杯。他闻了闻玻璃杯，又嗅了嗅大肚瓶。他唇间泛起一抹厌恶的笑容。“死变态。”他语调平板地说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He slid into the chair behind the desk and hooked the mulberry-colored phone towards him and shifted the Luger to his left hand.

"I think we'll have some law," he said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他哧溜一下坐进书桌后面的椅子里，曲指将那台桑葚色的电话机勾近身前，把卢格尔枪换到左手。他诡诈地皱额看着电话机，两道灰色的浓眉拧出了交集，那只鹰钩鼻顶上的沧桑皮肤出现了深深的褶皱。“我想我们应该报警。”他说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I'm not ready to give out. Killing Geiger to grab his racket would be a dumb trick and I'm not sure it happened that way, assuming he has been killed. But I'm sure that whoever got the books knows what's what, and I'm sure that the blonde lady down at his store is scared batty about something or other. And I have a guess who got the books."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我还没准备说出来呢。杀死盖革来霸占他的生意是个昏招，就算盖革已经被人杀了，我也无法肯定事情就是那样的。但我敢肯定，书现在到了谁手里，谁就知道真相，我也敢肯定，准是发生了什么事，叫盖革店里的那个金发女郎吓破了胆。至于谁得到了那批书，我有个猜想。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He slammed the desk hard. "Listen, soldier. I ask you a question and you ask me another. We're not getting anywhere. I want to know where Geiger is, for my own personal reasons. I didn't like his racket and I didn't protect him. I happen to own this house. I'm not so crazy about that right now. I can believe that whatever you know about all this is under glass, or there would be a flock of johns squeaking sole leather around this dump. You haven't got anything to sell. My guess is you need a little protection yourself. So cough up."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他狠狠捶了一下桌面。“听着，当兵的。我问你一句，你也问我一句。这样就成兜圈子了。我想知道盖革在哪里，我自有我个人的理由。我不喜欢他的买卖，也没有保护他。我正巧是这里的房东。我又不是非得立马知道真相。我相信，不管你知道了什么，这一切肯定都还没见光，要不然这鬼地方周围早有一群警察在蹲点了。你没什么可以待价而沽的东西。依我看，需要一点保护的是你自己。所以老实交代吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His face whitened under the tan. He looked mean, fast and tough for a moment. He made a movement to lift the gun. I added casually: "By the way, how is Mrs. Mars these days?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他久经曝晒的皮肤竟黑里透出白来。有那么片刻，他看起来卑鄙、狡诈而冷酷。他作势要举枪。我云淡风轻地补充道：“顺便问一句，马尔斯太太这两天可好？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was a good guess, but I wasn't going to let him know it. I lit a cigarette and blew the match out and flicked it at the glass eye of the totem pole. "You're right," I said. "If anything has happened to Geiger, I'll have to give what I have to the law. Which puts it in the public domain and doesn't leave me anything to sell. So with your permission I'll just drift."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他猜得不错，但我不打算让他知道这点。我点上一根烟，把火柴吹灭后往图腾柱上一弹。“你说得对，”我说，“如果盖革出了什么事，我就必须向警方兜底交代。这样一来，一切都公之于众，我自然没什么可以待价而沽的东西。所以你允许的话，我就告辞了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He leaned down on the desk, frozen-eyed, unmoving. I went over to the door and opened it and looked back at him. His eyes had followed me, but his lean gray body had not moved. There was hate in his eyes. I went out and through the hedge and up the hill to my car and got into it. I turned it around and drove up over the crest. Nobody shot at me. After a few blocks I turned off, cut the motor and sat for a few moments. Nobody followed me either. I drove back into Hollywood.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他俯身靠在桌子上，眼神呆滞，一动不动。我走到门口，打开门回头望着他。他的目光一直跟着我，但他瘦长的灰色身体并没动。他眼里透着恨意。我出了门，穿过树障，一径上山钻进车里。我调转车头，驱车翻过山顶。没人朝我开枪。开过几条街后我拐了个弯，熄掉火，坐了好一阵。也没人跟踪我。我往好莱坞开了回去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I thought for a moment I had kidded him a little too far. His hand jerked at the gun, shaking. His face was stretched out by hard muscles. "Beat it," he said quite softly. "I don't give a damn where you go or what you do when you get there. Only take a word of advice, soldier. Leave me out of your plans or you'll wish your name was Murphy and you lived in Limerick."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一度我都觉得这玩笑开得有点过头了。他的手朝着枪猝然一动，颤抖着。僵硬的肌肉绷长了他的脸。“滚，”他的声音非常轻，“你要去哪，去了之后准备干吗，我压根不在乎。但听我一句劝，当兵的。不管你有什么打算，别来招惹我，否则你会宁可你姓墨菲[2]，住在利莫瑞克。”【注：[2]“墨菲”（Murphy）是爱尔兰常见姓氏，常带有戏谑的贬义。后文的“利莫瑞克”（Limerick）和“克朗梅尔”（Clonmel）都是爱尔兰的城市。】">查看中文翻译</div>
