<div class="line_en">The King's son was going to be married, so there were general rejoicings. He had waited a whole year for his bride, and at last she had arrived. She was a Russian Princess, and had driven all the way from Finland in a sledge drawn by six reindeer. The sledge was shaped like a great golden swan, and between the swan's wings lay the little Princess herself. Her long ermine-cloak reached right down to her feet, on her head was a tiny cap of silver tissue, and she was as pale as the Snow Palace in which she had always lived. So pale was she that as she drove through the streets all the people wondered. "She is like a white rose!" they cried, and they threw down flowers on her from the balconies.</div>

<div class="line_en">For the next three days everybody went about saying, "White rose, Red rose, Red rose, White rose"; and the King gave orders that the Page's salary was to be doubled. As he received no salary at all this was not of much use to him, but it was considered a great honour, and was duly published in the Court Gazette.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这以后的三天中人人都说着：“白玫瑰，红玫瑰；红玫瑰，白玫瑰。”于是国王下令给那个侍卫的薪金增加一倍。不过他根本就没有拿薪水，因此这道加薪的命令对他没有任何作用，然而这被视为一种莫大的荣誉，并按惯例在宫廷报纸上登出。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When the three days were over the marriage was celebrated. It was a magnificent ceremony, and the bride and bridegroom walked hand in hand under a canopy of purple velvet embroidered with little pearls. Then there was a State Banquet, which lasted for five hours. The Prince and Princess sat at the top of the Great Hall and drank out of a cup of clear crystal. Only true lovers could drink out of this cup, for if false lips touched it, it grew grey and dull and cloudy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="三天过后便举行了婚礼庆典。这是一次盛大的仪式，新郎和新娘在一幅绣着小珍珠的紫色鹅绒华盖下手牵着手走着。接着又举行了国宴，持续了五个小时。王子和公主坐在大厅的首座上，用一只纯清的水晶杯子饮酒。只有真诚的恋人才能用这只杯子喝酒，因为只要虚伪的嘴唇一挨上杯子，杯子就会变得灰暗无光。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After the banquet there was to be a Ball. The bride and bridegroom were to dance the Rose-dance together, and the King had promised to play the flute. He played very badly, but no-one had ever dared to tell him so, because he was the King. Indeed, he knew only two airs, and was never quite certain which one he was playing; but it made no matter, for, whatever he did, everybody cried out, "Charming! charming!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="宴会之后举办了舞会，新郎和新娘将要一块儿跳舞，国王答应为他们吹笛子。他吹得很不好，可没有人敢对他那么说，因为他是一国之君。说真的，他只会吹两种调子，并且从来也没有搞清楚他吹的是哪一种，不过也无关紧要，因为不管他吹的是什么，人们都会高喊狂叫：“棒极了！棒极了！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“世界真是太美丽了，”一个小爆竹大声喊道，“看看那些黄色的郁金香。啊！如果它们是真正的爆竹，它们会更逗人喜爱的。我很高兴我参加过旅游。旅游大大提高见识，并能除去一切个人的偏见。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The last item on the programme was a grand display of fireworks, to be let off exactly at midnight. The little Princess had never seen a firework in her life, so the King had given orders that the Royal Pyrotechnist should be in attendance on the day of her marriage.</div>

They wrote so much about it that nobody believed them, and I am not surprised. True love suffers, and is silent. I remember myself once–But it is no matter now. Romance is a thing of the past."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“任何地方只要你爱它，它就是你的世界，”一枚深思熟虑的转轮烟火激动地喊道。她早年曾恋上了一只旧的杉木箱子，并以这段伤心的经历而自豪。“不过爱情已不再时髦了，诗人们把它给扼杀了。他们对爱情抒发得太多，使人们不再相信那么回事。对此，我一点也不觉得吃惊。真正的爱情是痛苦的、是沉默的。我记得自己曾有过那么一回——可是现在已经结束了。浪漫只属于过去。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It may be so with you," he answered; "indeed, I have no doubt that it is, but with me it is different. I am a very remarkable Rocket, and come of remarkable parents. My mother was the most celebrated Catherine Wheel of her day, and was renowned for her graceful dancing. When she made her great public appearance she spun round nineteen times before she went out, and each time that she did so she threw into the air seven pink stars. She was three feet and a half in diameter, and made of the very best gunpowder. My father was a Rocket like myself, and of French extraction. He flew so high that the people were afraid that he would never come down again. He did, though, for he was of a kindly disposition, and he made a most brilliant descent in a shower of golden rain. The newspapers wrote about his performance in very flattering terms. Indeed, the Court Gazette called him a triumph of Pylotechnic art."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“对于你来说可能是这样的，”他回答说，“事实上这一点是肯定无疑的。不过对我而言事情就不一祥了。我是一枚非常神奇的火箭，出身于一个了不起的家庭。我母亲是她那个时代最出名的转轮烟火，并以她优美的舞姿而著称。只要她一出场亮相，她要旋转十九次才会飞出去，每转上一次，她就会向空中抛撒七颗粉红的彩星。她的直径有三英尺半，是用最好的火药制成的。我的父亲像我一样也是火箭，他来自法兰西。他飞得可真高，人们都担心他不会下来了。尽管如此，他还是下来了，因为他性格善良。他化作一阵金色的雨，非常耀眼地落了下来。报纸用足吹棒的词句描述他的表演。的确，宫廷的报纸把他称为烟花艺术的一个伟大成就。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"That is a very selfish reason," said the Rocket angrily. "What right have you to be happy? You should be thinking about others. In fact, you should be thinking about me. I am always thinking about myself, and I expect everybody else to do the same. That is what is called sympathy. It is a beautiful virtue, and I possess it in a high degree. Suppose, for instance, anything happened to me to-night, what a misfortune that would be for every one! The Prince and Princess would never be happy again, their whole married life would be spoiled; and as for the King, I know he would not get over it. Really, when I begin to reflect on the importance of my position, I am almost moved to tears."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这理由太自私了，”火箭脸带怒色地说，“你有什么权利高兴？你应该为别人想想。实际上，你应该为我想想。我总是想着我自己，我也希望别人都会这么做。这就是所谓的同情。这是个可爱的美德，我这方面的德性就很高。例如，假定今天夜里我出了什么事，那么对每一个人来说会是多么的不幸！王子和公主再也不会开心了，他们的婚后生活将会被毁掉；至于国王，他或许经不住这场打击。真的，我一想起自己所处的重要地位，我几乎感动得流下眼泪。”">查看中文翻译</div>

Why, anybody can have common sense, provided that they have no imagination. But I have imagination, for I never think of things as they really are; I always think of them as being quite different. As for keeping myself dry, there is evidently no one here who can at all appreciate an emotional nature. Fortunately for myself, I don't care. The only thing that sustains one through life is the consciousness of the immense inferiority of everybody else, and this is a feeling that I have always cultivated. But none of you have any hearts. Here you are laughing and making merry just as if the Prince and Princess had not just been married."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“常识，一点不假！”火箭愤愤不平地说，“可你忘了我是很不寻常的，而且非常了不起。啊，任何人如若没有想象力的话，也会具备常识的。然而我有想象力，因为我从没有把事物按照它们实际的情况去考虑，我总是把它们想象成另外一回事。至于要我本人不要流泪，很显然在场的各位没人能够欣赏多情的品性。所幸的是我本人并不介意。能够让我维持一生的唯一一件事就是想到自己要比别人优越得多，这也是我一贯培养的感觉。你们这些人都是没有情感的。你们只会傻笑或开玩笑，好像王子和公主不是刚刚结婚似的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
