<div class="line_en">Voldemort's voice reverberated from the walls and floor, and Harry realized that he was talking to Hogwarts and to all the surrounding area, that the residents of Hogsmeade and all those still fighting in the castle would hear him as clearly as if he stood beside them, his breath on the back of their necks, a deathblow away.</div>

<div class="line_en">Without a word to Harry, Ron and Hermione walked away. Harry saw Hermione approach Ginny, whose face was swollen and blotchy, and hug her. Ron joined Bill, Fleur, and Percy, who flung an arm around Ron's shoulders. As Ginny and Hermione moved closer to the rest of the family, Harry had a clear view of the bodies lying next to Fred: Remus and Tonks, pale and still and peaceful-looking, apparently asleep beneath the dark, enchanted ceiling.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="罗恩和赫敏没有对哈利说一句话就走开了。哈利看见赫敏走到金妮面前抱了抱她，金妮的脸肿着，满是污垢。罗恩走到比尔、芙蓉和珀西身边，珀西搂住了罗恩的肩膀。就在金妮和赫敏靠近家里其他人时，哈利看清了躺在弗雷德身边的两具遗体：莱姆斯和唐克斯，脸色苍白，一动不动，但看上去很宁静，似乎在施了魔法的漆黑的天花板下安详地睡着了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Great Hall seemed to fly away, become smaller, shrink, as Harry reeled backward from the doorway. He could not draw breath. He could not bear to look at any of the other bodies, to see who else had died for him. He could not bear to join the Weasleys, could not look into their eyes, when if he had given himself up in the first place, Fred might never have died…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利踉踉跄跄地后退着离开了门口，礼堂似乎在飞去，越缩越小。他透不过气来。他没有勇气再去看其他遗体，再去弄清还有谁为他而死。他不敢去见韦斯莱一家，不敢看他们的眼睛，如果他一开始就主动投降，弗雷德也许就不会死……">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He turned away and ran up the marble staircase. Lupin, Tonks… He yearned not to feel… He wished he could rip out his heart, his innards, everything that was screaming inside him…</div>

Harry ran without stopping, clutching the crystal flask of Snape's last thoughts, and he did not slow down until he reached the stone gargoyle guarding the headmaster's office.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="城堡里空无一人，就连幽灵似乎也加入了礼堂里哀悼的人群。哈利不停地往前跑，手里紧紧攥着装满斯内普最后思想的水晶瓶，一直跑到校长办公室外的石兽跟前才放慢了脚步。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Dumbledore!" said Harry without thinking, because it was he whom he yearned to see, and to his surprise the gargoyle slid aside, revealing the spiral staircase behind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“邓布利多！”哈利不假思索地喊道，因为他心里最想见的人就是邓布利多。令他吃惊的是，石兽竟然滑到一边，露出了后面的螺旋楼梯。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry glanced hopelessly at Dumbledore's deserted frame, which hung directly behind the headmaster's chair, then turned his back on it. The stone Pensieve lay in the cabinet where it had always been: Harry heaved it onto the desk and poured Snape's memories into the wide basin with its runic markings around the edge. To escape into someone else's head would be a blessed relief… Nothing that even Snape had left him could be worse than his own thoughts. The memories swirled, silver white and strange, and without hesitating, with a feeling of reckless abandonment, as though this would assuage his torturing grief, Harry dived.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利绝望地看了一眼挂在校长座椅后面的邓布利多的空肖像，然后转过身来。石头冥想盆还和往常一样放在柜子里。哈利把盆口刻有如尼文符号的大石盆搬到桌上，将斯内普的记忆倒了进去。逃到别人的思想里去也是一种解脱……即使是斯内普留给他的东西，也不可能比他自己的思绪更糟。记忆在旋转，银白色，形状奇异，哈利不再迟疑，抱着一种不管不顾、彻底放弃的心理，一头扎了进去，似乎这能缓解他内心刀割般的痛苦。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But when Harry burst into the circular office he found a change. The portraits that hung all around the walls were empty. Not a single headmaster or headmistress remained to see him; all, it seemed, had flitted away, charging through the paintings that lined the castle, so that they could have a clear view of what was going on.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利冲进圆形办公室，发现这里已经有了变化。墙上挂的肖像都空了。那些男女校长没有一个留在这里。他们似乎都逃走了，顺着城堡墙壁上排列的图画冲到了前面，想看清事态的发展。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But the girl had let go of the swing at the very height of its arc and flown into the air, quite literally flown, launched herself skyward with a great shout of laughter, and instead of crumpling on the playground asphalt, she soared like a trapeze artist through the air, staying up far too long, landing far too lightly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是，小女孩在秋千荡到最高处时松开手飞到空中，真的是在飞，欢声大笑着扑向天空。她并没有重重地摔在游戏场的柏油地上，而是像杂技演员一样在空中滑翔，停留了很长时间，最后十分轻盈地落在地上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He fell headlong into sunlight, and his feet found warm ground. When he straightened up, he saw that he was in a nearly deserted playground. A single huge chimney dominated the distant skyline. Two girls were swinging backward and forward, and a skinny boy was watching them from behind a clump of bushes. His black hair was overlong and his clothes were so mismatched that it looked deliberate: too short jeans, a shabby, overlarge coat that might have belonged to a grown man, an odd smocklike shirt.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他头朝前落进了阳光里，双脚踏在温暖的土地上。他直起身子，发现自己是在一个几乎没有人的游乐场上。一个大大的烟囱赫然耸立在远处的天际。两个女孩在荡秋千，一个瘦瘦的男孩躲在灌木丛后面注视着她们。男孩的黑头发很长，身上的衣服极不协调，倒像是故意穿成这个样子：一条过短的牛仔裤，一件又大又长、像是大人穿的破旧外衣，还有一件怪模怪样的孕妇服似的衬衫。">查看中文翻译</div>

Lily had picked up a fallen flower from the bush behind which Snape lurked. Petunia advanced, evidently torn between curiosity and disapproval. Lily waited until Petunia was near enough to have a clear view, then held out her palm. The flower sat there, opening and closing its petals, like some bizarre, many-lipped oyster.</div>

<div class="line_en">"You refuse to tell me everything, yet you expect that small service of me!" snarled Snape, and real anger flared in the thin face now. "You take a great deal for granted, Dumbledore! Perhaps I have changed my mind!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你什么都不肯告诉我，却还指望我帮你那个小忙！”斯内普低吼道。瘦瘦的脸上闪着真正的怒气，“你觉得许多事情都理所当然，邓布利多！说不定我改变主意了呢！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“那是哈利和我之间的事。现在，西弗勒斯，请你听仔细了。到了某个时候——在我死后——不要反驳，不要插嘴！到了某个时候，伏地魔似乎会为他那条大蛇的生命担心。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Precisely. If there comes a time when Lord Voldemort stops sending that snake forth to do his bidding, but keeps it safe beside him under magical protection, then, I think, it will be safe to tell Harry."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不错。如果到了某个时候，伏地魔不再派那条大蛇去执行命令，而是让它守在身边，用魔法把它保护起来，到了那时，我想就可以告诉哈利了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“为纳吉尼担心？”斯内普显得很惊愕。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Tell him that on the night Lord Voldemort tried to kill him, when Lily cast her own life between them as a shield, the Killing Curse rebounded upon Lord Voldemort, and a fragment of Voldemort's soul was blasted apart from the whole, and latched itself onto the only living soul left in that collapsing building. Part of Lord Voldemort lives inside Harry, and it is that which gives him the power of speech with snakes, and a connection with Lord Voldemort's mind that he has never understood. And while that fragment of soul, unmissed by Voldemort, remains attached to and protected by Harry, Lord Voldemort cannot die."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“告诉他，在伏地魔试图杀死他的那天夜里，当莉莉用自己的生命挡在他们之间时，那个杀戮咒反弹到伏地魔身上，伏地魔灵魂的一个碎片被炸飞了，附着在坍塌的房子里惟一活着的灵魂上。伏地魔的一部分活在哈利体内，使哈利有了与蛇对话的能力，并可以连接伏地魔的思想，这一直令他百思不得其解。只要那个没被伏地魔发现的灵魂碎片还依附在哈利身上，受到哈利的保护，伏地魔就不可能死。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"We have protected him because it has been essential to teach him, to raise him, to let him try his strength," said Dumbledore, his eyes still tight shut. "Meanwhile, the connection between them grows ever stronger, a parasitic growth: Sometimes I have thought he suspects it himself. If I know him, he will have arranged matters so that when he does set out to meet his death, it will truly mean the end of Voldemort."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们保护他，是因为必须调教他，培养他，让他磨炼自己的能力，”邓布利多说，仍然紧闭着眼睛，“与此同时，他们之间的连接也变得越来越强，像一种寄生的生命。有时我觉得他好像自己也有所察觉。如果我真的了解他，我认为他会把一切安排妥当，这样当他毅然赴死时，就意味着伏地魔的真正完结。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">From the tip of his wand burst the silver doe: She landed on the office floor, bounded once across the office, and soared out of the window. Dumbledore watched her fly away, and as her silvery glow faded he turned back to Snape, and his eyes were full of tears.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的杖尖蹦出了那头银色的牝鹿。它落在地板上，轻轻一跃就到了办公室那头，飞出了窗外。邓布利多注视着它远去，注视着它的银光消失，然后转脸望着斯内普，他的眼里已盈满泪水。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You will have to give Voldemort the correct date of Harry's departure from his aunt and uncle's," said Dumbledore. "Not to do so will raise suspicion, when Voldemort believes you so well informed. However, you must plant the idea of decoys; that, I think, ought to ensure Harry's safety. Try Confunding Mundungus Fletcher. And Severus, if you are forced to take part in the chase, be sure to act your part convincingly… I am counting upon you to remain in Lord Voldemort's good books as long as possible, or Hogwarts will be left to the mercy of the Carrows…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你必须把哈利离开他姨妈姨父家的确切日期告诉伏地魔，”邓布利多说，“伏地魔认为你消息非常灵通，你不这么做会引起怀疑的。不过，你必须把利用替身的主意灌输给别人——我想那样应该能够保证哈利的安全。试着对蒙顿格斯·弗莱奇用混淆咒。还有，西弗勒斯，如果你不得不参加追逐，一定要表现得令人信服……我指望你继续取得伏地魔的信任，时间越长越好，不然，霍格沃茨就会任由卡罗兄妹摆布……”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You will suggest to the Order of the Phoenix," Snape murmured, "that they use decoys. Polyjuice Potion. Identical Potters. It is the only thing that might work. You will forget that I have suggested this. You will present it as your own idea. You understand?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你要向凤凰社提出建议，”斯内普低声说道，“让他们使用替身。复方汤剂。几个一模一样的波特。只有这个办法才管用。你要忘记这个建议是我提的。要当成你自己的主意提出来。明白吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
