<div class="line_en">Harry did the best he could, trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his forehead, which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the forest. Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves because Harry couldn't sleep, but the truth was that Harry kept being woken by his old nightmare, except that it was now worse than ever because there was a hooded figure dripping blood in it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利全心全意地投入考试，尽量忘记前额上剧烈的刺痛。自从他上次从森林里回来，这种疼痛的感觉就一直纠缠着他。纳威看到哈利整夜睡不好觉，以为他患了严重的考试恐惧症。实际上，哈利是不断被过去的那个噩梦惊醒，而且现在比过去更糟，因为噩梦里又多了一个戴着兜帽、嘴角滴着鲜血的身影。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They had practical exams as well. Professor Flitwick called them one by one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tapdance across a desk. Professor McGonagall watched them turn a mouse into a snuffbox -- points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers. Snape made them all nervous, breathing down their necks while they tried to remember how to make a Forgetfulness potion.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="另外还有实际操作的考试。弗立维教授叫他们挨个儿走进教室里，看他们能不能使一只凤梨跳着踢踏舞走过一张书桌。麦格教授看着他们把一只老鼠变成一个鼻烟盒——盒子越精美，分数就越高；如果盒子上还留着老鼠的胡须，就要扣分。考魔药学时，他们拼命回忆遗忘药水的调配程序。斯内普站在背后密切注视着，他们脖子后面都能感觉到他的呼吸，这使他们心里非常紧张。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In years to come, Harry would never quite remember how he had managed to get through his exams when he half expected Voldemort to come bursting through the door at any moment. Yet the days crept by, and there could be no doubt that Fluffy was still alive and well behind the locked door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="今后几年，哈利恐怕永远也记不清，他是怎样通过那些考试的，因为当时他整天提心吊胆，随时提防着伏地魔破门而入。不过随着时间一天天地过去，似乎路威仍然在那扇紧锁的门后面，安然无恙地活着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was sweltering hot, especially in the large classroom where they did their written papers. They had been given special, new quills for the exams, which had been bewitched with an AntiCheating spell.</div>

<div class="line_en">Maybe it was because they hadn't seen what Harry had seen in the forest, or because they didn't have scars burning on their foreheads, but Ron and Hermione didn't seem as worried about the Stone as Harry. The idea of Voldemort certainly scared them, but he didn't keep visiting them in dreams, and they were so busy with their studying they didn't have much time to fret about what Snape or anyone else might be up to.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="罗恩和赫敏倒并不像哈利这样整日为魔法石担心，这也许是因为他们没有看见哈利在森林里遭遇的情景，也许是因为他们的前额上没有那道烧灼般疼痛的伤疤。伏地魔确实令他们害怕，但他只是一个抽象的概念，并没有来纠缠他们的梦境，而且他们整天忙着复习功课，也没有时间去操心斯内普或其他什么人可能会采取什么行动。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Their very last exam was History of Magic. One hour of answering questions about batty old wizards who'd invented selfstirring cauldrons and they'd be free, free for a whole wonderful week until their exam results came out. When the ghost of Professor Binns told them to put down their quills and roll up their parchment, Harry couldn't help cheering with the rest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后一门考的是魔法史。只要再坚持一个小时，回答出是哪几个古怪的老巫师发明了自动搅拌坩埚，他们就自由了，就可以轻轻松松地玩上整整一个星期，直到考试成绩公布。当宾斯教授的幽灵叫他们放下羽毛笔把答题的羊皮纸卷起来时，哈利忍不住和其他同学一道欢呼起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That was far easier than I thought it would be," said Hermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds. "I needn't have learned about the 1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of Elfric the Eager."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“比我原先以为的容易多了，”当他们随着人群一起来到外面阳光灿烂的场地上时，赫敏说道，“我其实不需要去记‘1637年的狼人行为准则’，以及小精灵叛乱的经过。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Hermione always liked to go through their exam papers afterward, but Ron said this made him feel ill, so they wandered down to the lake and flopped under a tree. The Weasley twins and Lee Jordan were tickling the tentacles of a giant squid, which was basking in the warm shallows.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="赫敏总喜欢在考完之后再重温一遍考试内容，但罗恩说这使他感到恶心。于是他们慢悠悠地顺坡而下，来到湖边，扑通一声坐在树下。那边，一只大鱿鱼躺在温暖的浅水里晒太阳，韦斯莱孪生兄弟和李乔丹正在轻轻拨弄它的触须。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“多好啊，再也不用复习了。”罗恩快活地吐了一口气，伸展四肢躺在草地上。“哈利，高兴一点嘛，一个星期以后我们才会知道考得多么糟糕，没必要现在就为这个操心。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Harry, relax, Hermione's right, the Stone's safe as long as Dumbledore's around. Anyway, we've never had any proof Snape found out how to get past Fluffy. He nearly had his leg ripped off once, he's not going to try it again in a hurry. And Neville will play Quidditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哈利，放松一点儿，赫敏说得对，只要有邓布利多在，魔法石就不会有危险。不管怎么说，我们没有发现任何证据，能够确定斯内普打听到了制服路威的办法。他上次差点被咬断了腿，不会匆匆忙忙再去冒险尝试的。如果连海格都背叛了邓布利多，那么纳威就可以入选英格兰魁地奇球队了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry nodded, but he couldn't shake off a lurking feeling that there was something he'd forgotten to do, something important. When he tried to explain this, Hermione said, "That's just the exams. I woke up last night and was halfway through my Transfiguration notes before I remembered we'd done that one."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利点了点头，但他怎么也摆脱不了一种隐隐约约的感觉，似乎他忘了做一件事，一件非常重要的事。当他想对两个朋友解释这种感觉时，赫敏说：“这都是考试在作怪。我昨天夜里醒来，忙着复习变形课的笔记，然后才突然想起来，那门课我们已经考过了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

Hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past Fluffy… never… but --</div>

<div class="line_en">"Don't you think it's a bit odd," said Harry, scrambling up the grassy slope, "that what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon, and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket? How many people wander around with dragon eggs if it's against wizard law? Lucky they found Hagrid, don't you think? Why didn't I see it before?"</div>
