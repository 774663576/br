<div class="line_en">Somewhere along the way, my normally laid-back brother started to sprout worries. I can't say exactly when or why this began, but Craig -- the boy who could high-five and what-up his way around the neighborhood, who blithely catnapped anytime he had ten free minutes, regardless of his surroundings -- grew more fretful and vigilant at home, convinced that catastrophe was creeping our way. In the evenings at our apartment, he rehearsed for every outcome, immersing himself in hypotheticals the rest of us found bizarre. Worried he'd lose his sight, he took to wearing a blindfold around the house, learning to navigate our living room and kitchen by feel. Worried he might go deaf, he began teaching himself sign language. There was also apparently the threat of amputation, prompting Craig to fumble his way through various meals and homework sessions with his right arm tied behind his back. Because you never did know.</div>

<div class="line_en">Craig's biggest fear, however, was also probably the most realistic, and that was fire. House fires were a regular occurrence in Chicago, in part due to slumlords who let their buildings slide into disrepair and were all too happy to reap the insurance benefits when a fire tore through, and in part because home smoke detectors were a relatively new development and still expensive for working-class people to afford. Either way, inside our tight city grid, fire was almost a fact of life, a random but persistent snatcher of homes and hearts. My grandfather Southside had moved to our neighborhood after a fire destroyed his old house on the West Side, though luckily nobody'd been hurt. (According to my mother, Southside stood on the curb outside the burning house, shouting for the firefighters to direct their hoses away from his precious jazz albums.) More recently, in a tragedy almost too giant for my young mind to take in, one of my fifth-grade classmates -- a boy with a sweet face and a tall Afro named Lester McCullom, who lived around the corner from us in a town house on Seventy-Fourth Street -- had died in a fire that also killed his brother and sister, the three of them trapped by flames in bedrooms upstairs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克雷格最担心的，可能也是最现实的，就是火灾。家庭火灾在芝加哥司空见惯，部分原因是贫民区的房子年久失修，房东又放任不管，发生火灾正好可以向保险公司索赔；还有一部分原因是家用烟雾警报器是个相对较新的发明，价格不菲，工人阶层负担不起。不管怎样，在我们生活的城市里，火灾几乎是家常便饭，它能烧毁房屋，夺走生命。我的外祖父“南城的”后来搬到我们的社区，就是因为他在西区的老房子在火灾中烧毁了，幸好没有人受伤。（听母亲说，当时“南城的”站在熊熊燃烧的房子外的马路边上，大喊着让消防员别把水管往他那些宝贝爵士乐专辑的方向喷。）随后还发生了一场悲剧，我幼小的心灵在那时还无法接受那种惨剧。我五年级的一个同学，一个相貌可爱、高个子的非洲裔男孩—莱斯特·麦科勒姆，他就住在我家附近拐角处位于74街上的联排住宅里。一场火灾吞噬了他的生命，同时遇难的还有他的哥哥和妹妹，他们三人当时被大火困在了二楼的卧室里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As time passed, Craig's anxieties only grew. At school, we'd been put through the paces of teacher-led evacuation drills, dutifully enduring lectures on how to stop, drop, and roll. And as a result, Craig decided that we needed to step it up on safety at home, electing himself the family fire marshal, with me as his lieutenant, ready to clear exit pathways during drills or boss around our parents as needed. We weren't so much convinced we'd have a fire as we were fixated on being ready for one. Preparation mattered. Our family was not just punctual; we arrived early to everything, knowing that it made my dad less vulnerable, sparing him from having to worry about finding a parking spot that didn't require him to walk a long way or an accessible seat in the bleachers at one of Craig's basketball games. The lesson being that in life you control what you can.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="时间一天天过去，克雷格的焦虑有增无减。在学校时，我们在老师的带领下进行过疏散演习，他顺从地学习停下、倒地、滚动三步火灾自救法。最终克雷格决定，我们要在家里提高安全等级，并自封为家庭消防队队长，让我当他的副手，随时准备在演习时清理逃生的通道，或者在需要时让父母配合行动。我们不太相信家里真的会发生火灾，但是我们都认为一定要做好准备。准备工作很重要。我们一家人不管去哪儿都很准时，甚至还会提前到达。如此，父亲就可以从容地找到一个让他少走些路的停车位，去看克雷格打篮球比赛时，也有时间在露天看台上找到一个方便进去的座位。这些都教会我们一件事，那就是人生要学会提前计划。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Theirs was the first wake I ever attended: every kid in the neighborhood sobbing at the funeral parlor as a Jackson 5 album played softly in the background; the adults stunned into silence, no prayer or platitude capable of filling the void. There were three closed caskets at the front of the room, each one with a framed photograph of a smiling child on its lid. Mrs. McCullom, who with her husband had managed to survive the fire by jumping out a window, sat before them, so slumped and broken that it hurt to look in her direction.</div>

<div class="line_en">Should things get scary, we realized, our rescue wouldn't unfold the way rescues did in the tidy after-school movies we watched on TV. It would not be our dad who'd throw us over his shoulder with Herculean grace and carry us to safety. If anyone, it would have to be Craig, who would eventually tower over my father but was then still a narrow-shouldered, spindle-legged boy who seemed to understand that any heroics on his part would require practice. Which is why during our family fire drills, he started conjuring the worst-case scenarios, ordering my dad to the floor, instructing him to lie there limp and heavy as a sack, as if he'd passed out from smoke inhalation.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们意识到，万一发生紧急情况，我们的自救工作不可能像课后播放的电影里那样进行。我们的父亲不会像大力神一样，轻松地把我们扛在肩上带到安全地带。如果有人要这么做，那只能是克雷格。他的个头儿后来超过了父亲，然而在当时，他还是一个肩膀瘦削、两腿细长的男孩，他似乎明白，任何英勇行为都需要练习。为此，在我们的家庭消防演习中，他设计出最糟糕的情况，让父亲躺在地板上，并告知他要像一条麻袋一样绵软无力，假装吸入浓烟后昏倒。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">To this end, as kids, we ran through our escape-route possibilities, trying to guess whether we could jump from a window to the oak tree in front of the house or to a neighbor's rooftop in the event of a fire. We imagined what would happen if a grease fire broke out in the kitchen, or if an electrical fire started in the basement, or if lightning struck from above. Craig and I had little concern about our mom in an emergency. She was small and agile and one of those people who, if her adrenaline got going, could probably bench-press a car off a baby. What was harder to talk about was Dad's disability -- the obvious but unstated truth that he couldn't readily leap from a window like the rest of us, and it had been years since we'd seen him run.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="为此，我和哥哥想出各种逃生路线，甚至还讨论一旦火灾发生，我们是从窗户跳到屋前的橡树上还是邻居的屋顶上。我们想象着各种可能性，比如厨房里发生油脂类火灾，地下室发生电气类火灾，或者房子被闪电击中而着火。如有紧急情况，克雷格和我一点儿都不担心母亲。她个头儿小，动作敏捷，是那种假如肾上腺素飙升，都能举起一辆车以救下遇险小娃娃的人。而父亲就不好讲了，这不言自明，他拖着病腿，不可能像我们一样轻而易举地跳窗逃生，我们都已经好几年没见过他跑步了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">My father was not accustomed to being helpless. He lived his life in defiance of that very prospect, assiduously looking after our car, paying the bills on time, never discussing his advancing multiple sclerosis nor missing a day of work. To the contrary, my father loved to be the rock for others. What he couldn't do physically, he substituted with emotional and intellectual guidance and support, which is why he enjoyed his work as a precinct captain for the city's Democratic Party. He'd held the post for years, in part because loyal service to the party machine was more or less expected of city employees. Even if he'd been half forced into it, though, my dad loved the job, which baffled my mother given the amount of time it demanded. He paid weekend visits to a nearby neighborhood to check in on his constituents, often with me reluctantly in tow. We'd park the car and walk along streets of modest bungalows, landing on a doorstep to find a hunched-over widow or a big-bellied factory worker with a can of Michelob peering through the screen door. Often, these people were delighted by the sight of my father smiling broadly on their porch, propped up by his cane.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="父亲不习惯无助。他尽全力管理着自己的生活，勤勉地照顾家里的车，按时支付家庭账单，从不讨论他日益加重的多发性硬化症，而且没有误过一天工。正相反，父亲乐意成为别人的靠山，体力上不能做的，就用情感和智力上的引导与支持来代替。正因如此，他喜欢自己选区区长的工作，为芝加哥的民主党服务。他担任这个职务已经有很多年，部分原因是本市雇员多少有责任为政党机器效劳。尽管父亲当时也是赶鸭子上架，但他热爱这份工作。母亲对此一直想不通，因为它耗费的时间实在太多。父亲每个周末都会去附近的社区看望他的选民，后面经常跟着不情不愿的我。我们会在停车后，步行穿过两旁都是简易平房的街道，来到某个弯腰驼背的寡妇或者某个大腹便便、喝着一罐米凯罗啤酒、往纱门外张望的工人门前。这些人看到父亲面带笑容、拄着手杖站在他们门外，通常都很高兴。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For me, this was never good news. It meant we were going inside. It meant that my whole Saturday afternoon would now get sucked up as I got parked on a musty sofa or with a 7UP at a kitchen table while my dad fielded feedback -- complaints, really -- that he'd then pass on to the elected alderman who controlled the ward. When somebody had problems with garbage pickup or snow plowing or was irritated by a pothole, my dad was there to listen. His purpose was to help people feel cared for by the Democrats -- and to vote accordingly when elections rolled around. To my dismay, he never rushed anyone along. Time, as far as my father was concerned, was a gift you gave to other people. He clucked approvingly at pictures of cute grandkids, patiently endured gossip and long litanies of health woes, and nodded knowingly at stories about how money was tight. He hugged the old ladies as we finally left their houses, assuring them he'd do his best to be useful -- to get the fixable issues fixed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这句话对我来说可不是好消息。它意味着我们要进到屋里去，意味着我整个星期六下午就只能坐在一张散发着霉味儿的沙发上，或者坐在餐桌前喝一罐七喜汽水，听父亲收集反馈意见—其实是投诉。他会把这些转给当选的市政委员会委员，也就是选区的负责人。当人们遇到垃圾收集、扫雪、路面不平整等问题时，父亲就会到场。他的目的是让选民感受到民主党在照顾着他们，当选举活动到来时他们能够积极投票。让我感到沮丧的是，他从不催促任何人。对父亲来说，时间是你给别人的礼物。他会啧啧称赞一张可爱的孙辈照片，耐心地聆听人们讲八卦、喋喋不休地谈论自己的健康问题，听到人家说钱如何不够用时点头表示理解。最后，当我们从那些老太太家里起身告辞时，父亲会拥抱她们，保证会尽全力帮助她们，把可以解决的事情都解决掉。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">With a sigh, he'd close his eyes, waiting to feel Craig's hands hook themselves solidly beneath his shoulders to start the rescue operation. My mother and I would then watch as, with no small amount of effort and a good deal of awkwardness, my brother managed to drag 170 or so pounds of paternal deadweight backward through the imaginary inferno that raged in his preadolescent mind, hauling my father across the floor, rounding the couch, and finally making it to the stairwell.</div>

<div class="line_en">My dad had faith in his own utility. It was a point of pride. Which is why at home during our fire drills he had little interest in being a passive prop, even in a pretend crisis. He had no intention, under any circumstance, of being a liability -- of winding up the unconscious guy on the floor. But still, some part of him seemed to understand that this mattered to us -- to Craig in particular. When we asked him to lie down, he'd humor us, dropping first to his knees, then to his butt, then spreading himself out obligingly, faceup on the living room carpet. He'd exchange glances with my mother, who found it all a little funny, as if to say, These damn kids.</div>

<div class="line_en">From here, Craig figured he could probably slide my dad's body down the stairs and out the side door to safety. My father always refused to let him practice this part, saying gently, "That's enough now," and insisting on getting back to his feet before Craig could try to lug him down the stairs. But between the small man and the grown man, the point had been made. None of this would be easy or comfortable if it came to it, and there were, of course, no guarantees that any of us would survive. But if the very worst happened, we at least had a plan.</div>

My mom's relatives tended to gather at Southside's house around the corner -- drawn by my grandfather's cooking, the ongoing games of bid whist, and the exuberant blasting of jazz. Southside acted as a magnet for all of us. He was forever mistrustful of the world beyond his own yard -- worried primarily about everyone's safety and well-being -- and as a result poured his energy into creating an environment where we were always well fed and entertained, likely with the hope we'd never want to move away from it. He even got me a dog, an affable, cinnamon-colored shepherd mutt we called Rex. Per my mother's orders, Rex wasn't allowed to live at our house, but I'd visit him all the time at Southside's, lying on the floor with my face buried in his soft fur, listening to his tail thwap appreciatively anytime Southside walked past.

My father, I thought, seemed more like a father and less like a brother with the three of them, offering them advice and slipping them cash when they needed it. Francesca was smart and beautiful and sometimes let me brush her long hair. Andrew and Carleton were in their early twenties and dazzlingly hip. They wore bell-bottoms and turtlenecks. They owned leather jackets, had girlfriends, and talked about things like Malcolm X and "soul power." Craig and I passed hours in their bedroom at the back of the apartment, just trying to sponge up their cool.</div>

But to my dad, everyone was kin. He lit up when he saw his uncle Calio, a skinny, wavy-haired little man who looked like Sammy Davis Jr. and was almost always drunk.

<div class="line_en">My grandfather, also named Fraser Robinson, was decidedly less fun to be around, a cigar-puffing patriarch who'd sit in his recliner with a newspaper open on his lap and the evening news blaring on the television nearby. His demeanor was nothing like my father's. For Dandy, everything was an irritant. He was galled by the day's headlines, by the state of the world as shown on TV, by the young black men --"boo-boos," he called them -- whom he perceived to be hanging uselessly around the neighborhood, giving black people everywhere a bad name. He shouted at the television. He shouted at my grandmother, a sweet, soft-spoken woman and devout Christian named LaVaughn. (My parents had named me Michelle LaVaughn Robinson, in honor of her.) By day, my grandmother expertly managed a thriving Bible bookstore on the Far South Side, but in her off-hours with Dandy she was reduced to a meekness I found perplexing, even as a young girl. She cooked his meals and absorbed his barrage of complaints and said nothing in her own defense. Even at a young age, there was something about my grandmother's silence and passivity in her relationship with Dandy that got under my skin.</div>

<div class="line_en">According to my mother, I was the only person in the family to talk back to Dandy when he yelled. I did it regularly, from the time I was very young and over many years, in part because it drove me crazy that my grandmother wouldn't speak up for herself, in part because everyone else fell silent around him, and lastly because I loved Dandy as much as he confounded me. His stubbornness was something I recognized, something I'd inherited myself, though I hoped in a less abrasive form. There was also a softness in Dandy, which I caught only in glimmers. He tenderly rubbed my neck sometimes when I sat at the foot of his reclining chair. He smiled when my dad said something funny or one of us kids managed to slip a sophisticated word into a conversation. But then something would set him off and he'd start snarling again.</div>

<div class="line_en">Dandy was from the South Carolina Low Country, having grown up in the humid seaport of Georgetown, where thousands of slaves once labored on vast plantations, harvesting crops of rice and indigo and making their owners rich. My grandfather, born in 1912, was the grandson of slaves, the son of a millworker, and the oldest of what would be ten children in his family. A quick-witted and intelligent kid, he'd been nicknamed "the Professor" and set his sights early on the idea of someday going to college. But not only was he black and from a poor family, he also came of age during the Great Depression. After finishing high school, Dandy went to work at a lumber mill, knowing that if he stayed in Georgetown, his options would never widen. When the mill eventually closed, like many African Americans of his generation he took a chance and moved north to Chicago, joining what became known as the Great Migration, in which six million southern blacks relocated to big northern cities over the course of five decades, fleeing racial oppression and chasing industrial jobs.</div>

<div class="line_en">This particular form of discrimination altered the destinies of generations of African Americans, including many of the men in my family, limiting their income, their opportunity, and, eventually, their aspirations. As a carpenter, Southside wasn't allowed to work for the larger construction firms that offered steady pay on long-term projects, given that he couldn't join a labor union. My great-uncle Terry, Robbie's husband, had abandoned a career as a plumber for the same reason, instead becoming a Pullman porter. There was also Uncle Pete, on my mother's side, who'd been unable to join the taxi drivers' union and instead turned to driving an unlicensed jitney, picking up customers who lived in the less safe parts of the West Side, where normal cabs didn't like to go. These were highly intelligent, able-bodied men who were denied access to stable high-paying jobs, which in turn kept them from being able to buy homes, send their kids to college, or save for retirement. It pained them, I know, to be cast aside, to be stuck in jobs that they were overqualified for, to watch white people leapfrog past them at work, sometimes training new employees they knew might one day become their bosses. And it bred within each of them at least a basic level of resentment and mistrust: You never quite knew what other folks saw you to be.</div>

<div class="line_en">If this were an American Dream story, Dandy, who arrived in Chicago in the early 1930s, would have found a good job and a pathway to college. But the reality was far different. Jobs were hard to come by, limited at least somewhat by the fact that managers at some of the big factories in Chicago regularly hired European immigrants over African American workers. Dandy took what work he could find, setting pins in a bowling alley and freelancing as a handyman. Gradually, he downgraded his hopes, letting go of the idea of college, thinking he'd train to become an electrician instead. But this, too, was quickly thwarted. If you wanted to work as an electrician (or as a steelworker, carpenter, or plumber, for that matter) on any of the big job sites in Chicago, you needed a union card. And if you were black, the overwhelming odds were that you weren't going to get one.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果是在一个美国梦式的故事里，20世纪30年代早期祖父来到芝加哥后，会找到一份好工作，还可以设法上大学。但是，现实远没有那么美好。工作很难找，部分原因是当时一些大工厂更愿意雇用欧洲移民而非黑人。祖父什么工作都做，他曾在保龄球馆整理球瓶，业余时间做点儿杂活。慢慢地，他向现实妥协，放弃了上大学的想法，转而考虑参加培训，希望成为一名电工，但就连这个计划也很快受挫。如果你想在芝加哥做一名电工（或者炼钢工人、木匠、水管工等），或者在任何一家大工厂工作，你必须有工会会员证，但黑人基本不可能拿到这个证。">查看中文翻译</div>

Andrew and Carleton would go on to become a train conductor and an engineer, respectively. Francesca worked as a creative director in advertising for a time and eventually became a grade school teacher.

In my own life, I was starting to encounter questions I couldn't readily answer. One came from a girl whose name I can't remember -- one of the distant cousins who played with us in the backyard of one of my great-aunts' bungalows farther west of us, part of the loosely related crowd that often turned up when my parents drove over for a visit. As the adults drank coffee and laughed in the kitchen, a parallel scene would unfold outside as Craig and I joined whatever pack of kids came with those adults. Sometimes it was awkward, all of us managing a forced camaraderie, but generally it worked out. Craig almost always disappeared into a basketball game. I'd jump double Dutch or try to fall into whatever banter was going on.</div>

<div class="line_en">But I knew what she was getting at. There was no denying it, even if I just had. I did speak differently than some of my relatives, and so did Craig. Our parents had drilled into us the importance of using proper diction, of saying "going" instead of "goin' " and "isn't" instead of "ain't." We were taught to finish off our words. They bought us a dictionary and a full Encyclopaedia Britannica set, which lived on a shelf in the stairwell to our apartment, its titles etched in gold. Any time we had a question about a word, or a concept, or some piece of history, they directed us toward those books. Dandy, too, was an influence, meticulously correcting our grammar or admonishing us to enunciate our words when we went over for dinner. The idea was we were to transcend, to get ourselves further. They'd planned for it. They encouraged it. We were expected not just to be smart but to own our smartness -- to inhabit it with pride -- and this filtered down to how we spoke.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是我明白她的意思。我无法反驳她，因为我确实和这些亲戚说话方式不同，克雷格也是如此。我们的父母从小给我们灌输使用标准词汇说话的重要性，比如：要说“going”而不是“goin'”；要说“isn't”而不是“ain't” [4]。我们被教导要把单词说完整。父母给我们买了一本词典，还有一整套《大不列颠百科全书》，放在我们公寓的楼梯间的架子上，书名是烫金的。每次我们对某个单词、某个概念或者某段历史有疑问，他们就让我们去查阅那些书。祖父的影响也是一个因素，我们过去吃晚饭时，他会一丝不苟地纠正我们的语法，告诫我们说话吐字要清晰。总的意思是，我们要超越现状，走得更远。他们早早让我们做准备，并鼓励我们。他们期望我们不只要聪明，还要发挥自己的聪明才智，并且要贯穿到我们说话的方式中。【注：[4] goin'和ain't都是黑人俚语。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Yet it also could be problematic. Speaking a certain way -- the "white" way, as some would have it -- was perceived as a betrayal, as being uppity, as somehow denying our culture. Years later, after I'd met and married my husband -- a man who is light-skinned to some and dark-skinned to others, who speaks like an Ivy League-educated black Hawaiian raised by white middle-class Kansans -- I'd see this confusion play out on the national stage among whites and blacks alike, the need to situate someone inside his or her ethnicity and the frustration that comes when it can't easily be done. America would bring to Barack Obama the same questions my cousin was unconsciously putting to me that day on the stoop: Are you what you appear to be? Do I trust you or not?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，这样也有问题。我们这种说话方式被认为是“白人的”，是一种背叛和装腔作势，是对我们文化的一种否定。多年后，我认识并嫁给了我的丈夫，他的肤色有些人觉得白，有些人觉得黑，他说话的口音像是常青藤名校毕业、在堪萨斯州中产阶级白人家庭中长大的夏威夷黑人。在政治舞台上，我曾在白人和黑人脸上都看到过那种迷惑的表情，那种想把某人和自己的种族联系起来却发现并不容易时的懊丧。后来美国也向贝拉克·奥巴马提出了同样的问题，就像那天在门廊上我的亲戚无意中问我的：“你是黑人吗？我能否信任你？”">查看中文翻译</div>

It was hard to know what to do. All the while, I could hear the trickle of conversation going on between the adults in the kitchen nearby, my parents' laughter ringing easy and loud over the yard. I watched my brother in the flow of a sweaty game with a group of boys on the adjacent street corner. Everyone seemed to fit in, except for me. I look back on the discomfort of that moment now and recognize the more universal challenge of squaring who you are with where you come from and where you want to go.
