<div class="line_en">Mme de Villefort, who was in the drawing-room, immediately called for her son, so that he could repeat his thanks to the count. Edouard, who for the past two days had heard tell of nothing except this great man, hurried down -- not out of any desire to obey his mother or to thank the count, but from curiosity and to make some remark which would allow him the opportunity for one of those jibes that his mother always greeted with: "Oh, the wicked child! But you have to forgive him, he's so witty!"</div>

<div class="line_en">Carried forward by the rapidity of the narrative, we have merely introduced Valentine to the reader without making her better known. She was a tall, slim girl of nineteen, with light-chestnut hair, dark-blue eyes and a languid manner, marked by that exquisite distinction that had been characteristic of her mother. Her slender, white hands, her pearl-white neck and her cheeks, marbled with transient patches of colour, gave her at first sight the appearance of one of those beautiful English girls whose walk has been somewhat poetically compared to the progress of a swan mirrored in a lake.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们老在匆匆地叙述，还没把凡兰蒂向我们的读者正式介绍过，她是一个十九岁的姑娘，身材很高，姿容温雅，有光亮的褐色头发，深蓝色的眼睛和那种极其高贵的娇弱郁闷的神气，这种神气完全象她的母亲。她那洁白纤细的手指，她那珠圆玉润的颈项，她那时红时白的脸颊，使人一见，就觉得她的容貌象那种诗意地自比为顾影自怜的天鹅的英国美女。">查看中文翻译</div>

In any case, I am entirely unacquainted with Parisian society for, as I think I had the honour to inform you, I have only been in Paris for a few days. No, if you would allow me to search my memory… Wait…" The count put a hand to his forehead, as if to concentrate his memory. "No, it was outside… It was… I don't know… but I think the memory involves some kind of religious ceremony… Mademoiselle had a bunch of flowers in her hand, the boy was running after a fine peacock in a garden and you, Madame, were sitting under an arbour… Do help me, please: does what I am saying not remind you of anything?"</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我来帮您回忆，夫人，”伯爵又说，“那天的天气热得象火烧一样，您在那儿等马车，因为是节日，所以车子迟了。小姐在花园的树荫底下散步，令郎去赶那只鸟，后来就跑得不见了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

I had been living in that hostelry for a fortnight; I cured my valet of a fever and the innkeeper of jaundice, so I was regarded as a great doctor.

There, too, disguised under other names and concealed in different costumes, they have police commissioners, investigating magistrates, crown prosecutors and other experts. Criminals there are very pleasantly hanged, decapitated or impaled; but, being clever fraudsters, they have managed to outwit human justice and ensure the success of their designs by skilful plotting. In our country, when some fool is seized with the demon of hatred or greed, when he has an enemy to destroy or a grandparent to obliterate, he goes to a grocer, gives a false name (that will identify him more surely than his real one) and, pretending that the rats are keeping him awake, he buys five or six grammes of arsenic. If he is very clever, he goes to five or six grocers, so he will be five or six times more easily detected. Then, once he has his medicine, he administers a dose of arsenic to his enemy or his grandparent that would kill a mammoth or a mastodon, and this, without rhyme or reason, causes the victim to emit cries that put the whole district into a turmoil. At that, a crowd of policemen and gendarmes arrives. They send for a doctor who cuts the dead man open and takes arsenic by the spoonful out of his stomach and his entrails. The next day, a hundred newspapers report the matter with the name of the victim and the murderer. The very same evening, the grocer -- or grocers -- come and announce: 'I sold this gentleman the arsenic.' They would identify twenty purchasers, rather than not identify this one. So the foolish criminal is caught, imprisoned, interrogated, confronted, confounded, condemned and guillotined. Or, if it is a woman of some status, then she is sentenced to life imprisonment.

<div class="line_en">"Yes. Let me give you just one example. He had a splendid garden, full of vegetables, flowers and fruit. From among his vegetables he would choose the least exotic, most digestible of all: say, a cabbage. For three days he would water this cabbage with a solution of arsenic. On the third day, the cabbage would fall sick and wither: this was the moment to cut it. Everyone saw it as ripe and healthy, only Abbé Adelmonte knew it was poisoned. So he took the cabbage home, got a rabbit -- he had a collection of rabbits, cats and guineapigs as magnificent as his collection of vegetables, flowers and fruit -- and made the rabbit eat a leaf of the cabbage. The rabbit died. What investigating magistrate would dare question this; what crown prosecutor would ever draw up a petition against Monsieur Magendie or Monsieur Flourens for the rabbits, guinea-pigs and cats that they have killed? Not one. So the rabbit is now dead, and the law has no reason to ask questions about it. Abbé Adelmonte gets his cook to gut the rabbit and throws the intestines on a dungheap. On the dungheap there is a hen, which pecks at the intestines, falls ill in its turn and dies the following day. Just as it is in its final, convulsive agony, a vulture flies past -- there are a lot of vultures in Adelmonte's country -- dives at the body and carries it off to a distant crag to eat it. Three days later the poor vulture, having felt constantly ill since its meal, is seized with a fainting fit several hundred feet up. It falls out of the sky and plummets into your fishpond. Pikes, eels and moray eels are greedy fish, as you know, so they bite the vulture. Well, suppose that on the following day this eel or this pike is served up at your table, poisoned at four removes, and your guest is poisoned at the fifth and dies after a week or ten days from a pain in the guts, vomiting and an abscess on the duodenum. There will be a post-mortem and the doctors will say: 'The patient died of a tumour on the liver, or of typhoid fever.'"</div>

He thought a while, smiled and replied with a Sicilian proverb which, I believe, is also a French one: 'My child, the world was not made in a day, but in seven. Come back on Sunday.' The following Sunday I returned. Instead of watering his cabbage with arsenic, he had watered it with a solution of salts of strychnine, strychnos colubrina, as scientists call it. This time, the cabbage seemed altogether healthy, so the rabbit had no suspicion of it. Five minutes later the rabbit died, the hen ate the rabbit, and the following day it was dead. So then we played the part of the vultures, took off the hen and opened it up. This time all specific symptoms had vanished and only general symptoms remained. There was no specific indication in any organ -- irritation of the nervous system, that's all, and evidence of cerebral congestion, nothing more. The hen had not been poisoned, it had died of apoplexy. This is a rare condition in hens, I know, but very common among human beings."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Ah, Madame, such scruples would naturally arise in a soul as honest as yours, but might soon be eradicated by reasoning. The worse side of human thought will always be summed up in that paradox of Jean-Jacques Rousseau -- you know the one: 'The mandarin whom one can kill from a distance of five hundred leagues just by raising a finger'. Man's life is spent doing such things and his intelligence is exhausted in dreaming about them. You will find very few people who would go, brutally, and stick a knife in the heart of their fellow man or who, to make him disappear off the face of the earth, would administer the amount of arsenic that we mentioned a short time ago. That is really either eccentricity or stupidity. One can only reach that point if the blood is heated up to thirty-six degrees, the pulse is racing at ninety beats a minute and the mind is driven outside its ordinary limits. But if, as though advancing like a philologist from a word to its near synonym, you make a mere 'elimination'… Instead of committing a base murder, you purely and simply remove from your path the person who bothers you, without any clash, or violence, or all that paraphernalia of suffering which, becoming a torment, makes the victim into a martyr and the person responsible into a butcher, in the full force of the word… If there is no blood, no cries, no contortions and, above all, none of that horrible and compromising instantaneousness of the event, then you will evade the weight of the human law that tells you: 'Don't upset the social order!' This is what Orientals do and that is how they succeed: serious and phlegmatic people, they are little troubled by matters of time when something of any importance is to be resolved."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“真的，夫人，象您这样头脑纯洁的人，一定会发生这种迟疑，但这种迟疑很容易向坚强的理智屈服。您知道，卢梭曾说：‘一万五千哩外伸一伸手指尖，满大人就被杀死了，’这一句怪话最能表示人类思想上恶劣的一面。人的一生就是在做这种事情上消磨的，老是想着这种事情，他的智力就在这些梦想中干涸了。您找不到多少人会残忍地把一把小刀刺进一个同类人的心里，或是为了要把他从地球上抹掉，而使用我们刚才所谈的那种大量的砒霜。这种事情的确是超出常规之外的——是由于怪癖或愚蠢。要做这样的事情，血温一定会高到三十六度，脉搏至少要到九十，而情绪也会兴奋得超出一般限度。但假如，象我们在语言学上所下的功夫一样，把那两个字换成字面比较温和的同义语，你只是‘除掉’一个人，假如你不是犯卑鄙的暗杀罪而只是除掉一个挡在你的路上的人，不必用暴力，不必心惊肉跳，不会产生痛苦，使牺牲者大受折磨，假如不流血，没有呻吟，没有痉挛般的挣扎，总之，没有那种立刻发生的可怕的情形——那末，你就可以逃过人类的法律，因为法律只对你说：‘不要扰乱社会！’这种事情，在东方诸国就是这样的，那儿的人天性庄重冷静，在考虑一件事的重要性的时候，他们对于时间就极不注意了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes," said Monte Cristo. "Yes, fortunately there is still conscience, because without it we should be in a fine mess. After any slightly energetic action, conscience saves us, because it supplies us with a thousand good excuses, which we alone are left to judge: these excuses, effective as they may be in ensuring our sleep, might perhaps be rather less so before a court where they had to protect our lives. So Richard III, for example, was wonderfully well served by his conscience after the elimination of Edward IV's two children. He could say to himself: 'These two children, sons of a cruel tyrant, had inherited the vices of their father, though I alone was able to detect this in their juvenile dispositions. These two children stood in the way of my efforts to bring happiness to the English people, to whom they would certainly have brought misfortune.' In the same way, Lady Macbeth was served by her conscience: her desire, whatever Shakespeare says, was to give a throne to her son, not to her husband. Oh, maternal love is such a great virtue and powerful impulse that it can excuse many things. Hence, without her conscience, Lady Macbeth would have been a very unhappy woman after the death of Duncan."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，”基督山答道，“是的，幸而还有良心，要是没有它的话，我们将痛苦到什么地步呀！在每一个需要努力的行动以后，总是良心来救了我们，它供给我们一千个自慰自解的理由，对于这些理由，惟一的裁判者就是我们自己。但是，不论这些理由对于催人安眠能产生多妙的作用，到了法庭面前却很少能救我们的性命。譬如说，理查三世①在害死爱德华四世的两个孩子以后，他的良心就对他起了极妙的作用。的确，他可以说：‘这两个孩子是一个残忍嗜杀的国王生的，他们已承袭了他们父亲的恶习，这一点，只有我能够从他们幼年的习性上觉察出来，——我要促进英国人民的幸福，这两个孩子是我路上的障碍，因为他们无疑会伤害英国人民。’当麦克白斯夫人②为她的儿子——不管莎士比亚如何说，决不是为她的丈夫——设法弄到一个王位的时候，也就是她的良心安慰了她。啊，母爱是一项大美德，一个强烈的动机——这样的强烈，以致它可以使人做许多事情而心中坦然无愧，所以在邓肯③死后，麦克白斯夫人失掉了良心的慰藉，就万分痛苦了。”【注：①②③这三人都是莎士比亚的戏剧中的人物。】">查看中文翻译</div>
