<div class="line_en">Time passed on. A few more to-morrows, and the party from London would be arriving. It was an alarming change; and Emma was thinking of it one morning, as what must bring a great deal to agitate and grieve her, when Mr. Knightley came in, and distressing thoughts were put by. After the first chat of pleasure he was silent; and then, in a graver tone, began with, "I have something to tell you, Emma; some news."</div>

<div class="line_en">"It is a very simple story. He went to town on business three days ago, and I got him to take charge of some papers which I was wanting to send to John.-- He delivered these papers to John, at his chambers, and was asked by him to join their party the same evening to Astley's. They were going to take the two eldest boys to Astley's. The party was to be our brother and sister, Henry, John -- and Miss Smith. My friend Robert could not resist. They called for him in their way; were all extremely amused; and my brother asked him to dine with them the next day -- which he did -- and in the course of that visit (as I understand) he found an opportunity of speaking to Harriet; and certainly did not speak in vain.-- She made him, by her acceptance, as happy even as he is deserving. He came down by yesterday's coach, and was with me this morning immediately after breakfast, to report his proceedings, first on my affairs, and then on his own. This is all that I can relate of the how, where, and when. Your friend Harriet will make a much longer history when you see her.-- She will give you all the minute particulars, which only woman's language can make interesting.-- In our communications we deal only in the great.-- However, I must say, that Robert Martin's heart seemed for him, and to me, very overflowing; and that he did mention, without its being much to the purpose, that on quitting their box at Astley's, my brother took charge of Mrs. John Knightley and little John, and he followed with Miss Smith and Henry; and that at one time they were in such a crowd, as to make Miss Smith rather uneasy."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“事情很简单。三天前马丁有事进城去，我有几份文件想托他带给约翰。他把文件送到约翰家里，约翰请他当晚跟他们一道去阿斯特利剧场。他们准备带两个大孩子去。同去的有我弟弟、弟媳、亨利、约翰——还有史密斯小姐。我的朋友罗伯特没法推却，他们顺路去叫了他。大家都玩得很开心。我弟弟请他第二天跟他们一起吃饭——他真去了——我想就在这过程中，他找到了跟哈丽特说话的机会，而且他确实没有白说。哈丽特答应了他，使他高兴得不得了，他也应该高兴。他乘昨天的车子回来，今天早上一吃好早饭就来找我，谈了他办的事情，先是我交代的事，然后是他自己的事。怎么回事，什么地方，什么时间，我能说的就这么一些。你见到你的朋友哈丽特的时候，她会把来龙去脉讲得详细得多。她会把详情细节都讲出来，这些细枝末节只有女人讲起来才有趣。我们只讲些大概的情况。不过，我得说一句，在我看来，罗伯特·马丁似乎大喜过望。他提起一件完全无关的事情，说离开阿斯特利的包厢时，我弟弟带着他太太和小约翰在前面走，他跟史密斯小姐和亨利跟在后面。有一阵挤在人群中，搞得史密斯小姐很不自在。”">查看中文翻译</div>

His situation is an evil -- but you must consider it as what satisfies your friend; and I will answer for your thinking better and better of him as you know him more. His good sense and good principles would delight you.-- As far as the man is concerned, you could not wish your friend in better hands. His rank in society I would alter if I could, which is saying a great deal I assure you, Emma.-- You laugh at me about William Larkins; but I could quite as ill spare Robert Martin."</div>

In respectability of character, there can be no doubt that they are. I have been silent from surprize merely, excessive surprize. You cannot imagine how suddenly it has come on me! how peculiarly unprepared I was!-- for I had reason to believe her very lately more determined against him, much more, than she was before."</div>

He asked my opinion as to what he was now to do. He knew of no one but Mrs. Goddard to whom he could apply for information of her relations or friends. Could I mention any thing more fit to be done, than to go to Mrs. Goddard? I assured him that I could not. Then, he said, he would endeavour to see her in the course of this day."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我敢肯定，”奈特利先生一清二楚地答道。“他告诉我哈丽特已经答应他了，言词里没有什么晦涩和含糊的地方。我想我可以给你提供一个证据，说明事实就是这样。他征求我的意见，问我他现在该怎么办。除了戈达德太太以外，他不认识什么人，没法去了解哈丽特亲戚朋友的情况。我除了建议他去找戈达德太太以外，还能提出什么更好的办法呢？我实话跟他说，我想不出别的办法。于是他说，他只好今天找哈丽特。”">查看中文翻译</div>

They met readily and smiling, but with a consciousness which at first allowed little to be said; and having all sat down again, there was for some time such a blank in the circle, that Emma began to doubt whether the wish now indulged, which she had long felt, of seeing Frank Churchill once more, and of seeing him with Jane, would yield its proportion of pleasure. When Mr. Weston joined the party, however, and when the baby was fetched, there was no longer a want of subject or animation -- or of courage and opportunity for Frank Churchill to draw near her and say,</div>

She believed she had been foolish, but it had alarmed her, and she had been within half a minute of sending for Mr. Perry. Perhaps she ought to be ashamed, but Mr. Weston had been almost as uneasy as herself.-- In ten minutes, however, the child had been perfectly well again. This was her history; and particularly interesting it was to Mr. Woodhouse, who commended her very much for thinking of sending for Perry, and only regretted that she had not done it. "She should always send for Perry, if the child appeared in the slightest degree disordered, were it only for a moment. She could not be too soon alarmed, nor send for Perry too often. It was a pity, perhaps, that he had not come last night; for, though the child seemed well now, very well considering, it would probably have been better if Perry had seen it."</div>
