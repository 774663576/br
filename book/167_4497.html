<div class="line_en">He dreamed of a cracked stone ceiling and the smells of blood and shit and burnt flesh. The air was full of acrid smoke. Men were groaning and whimpering all around him, and from time to time a scream would pierce the air, thick with pain. When he tried to move, he found that he had fouled his own bedding. The smoke in the air made his eyes water. Am I crying? He must not let his father see. He was a Lannister of Casterly Rock. A lion, I must be a lion, live a lion, die a lion. He hurt so much, though. Too weak to groan, he lay in his own filth and shut his eyes. Nearby someone was cursing the gods in a heavy, monotonous voice. He listened to the blasphemies and wondered if he was dying. After a time the room faded.</div>

<div class="line_en">He found himself outside the city, walking through a world without color. Ravens soared through a grey sky on wide black wings, while carrion crows rose from their feasts in furious clouds wherever he set his steps. White maggots burrowed through black corruption. The wolves were grey, and so were the silent sisters; together they stripped the flesh from the fallen. There were corpses strewn all over the tourney fields. The sun was a hot white penny, shining down upon the grey river as it rushed around the charred bones of sunken ships. From the pyres of the dead rose black columns of smoke and white-hot ashes. My work, thought Tyrion Lannister. They died at my command.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="之后，他发觉自己身在城外，走在一个没有色彩的世界。乌鸦展开宽阔的黑翅膀，在灰色的天空中飞翔，随着他的移动，它们如片片狂暴的乌云，升腾而起，暂别腐肉盛宴。白蛆在黑的腐肉中钻来钻去。灰色的狼，灰色的静默姐妹，协力为死者脱去血肉。比武场中尸横遍地。太阳如炽热的白硬币，照耀着灰色河流上焦黑的沉船残骸。缕缕黑烟和纯白灰烬从火葬堆中升起。我的杰作，提利昂·兰尼斯特心想，他们死于我的号令。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So many dead, so very many. Their corpses hung limply, their faces slack or stiff or swollen with gas, unrecognizable, hardly human. The garments the sisters took from them were decorated with black hearts, grey lions, dead flowers, and pale ghostly stags. Their armor was all dented and gashed, the chainmail riven, broken, slashed. Why did I kill them all? He had known once, but somehow he had forgotten.</div>

<div class="line_en">At first there was no sound in the world, but after a time he began to hear the voices of the dead, soft and terrible. They wept and moaned, they begged for an end to pain, they cried for help and wanted their mothers. Tyrion had never known his mother. He wanted Shae, but she was not there. He walked alone amidst grey shadows, trying to remember…</div>

<div class="line_en">The silent sisters were stripping the dead men of their armor and clothes. All the bright dyes had leached out from the surcoats of the slain; they were garbed in shades of white and grey, and their blood was black and crusty. He watched their naked bodies lifted by arm and leg, to be carried swinging to the pyres to join their fellows. Metal and cloth were thrown in the back of a white wooden wagon, pulled by two tall black horses.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was dark when he woke again. At first he could see nothing, but after a time the vague outlines of a bed appeared around him. The drapes were drawn, but he could see the shape of carved bedposts, and the droop of the velvet canopy over his head. Under him was the yielding softness of a featherbed, and the pillow beneath his head was goose down. My own bed, I am in my own bed, in my own bedchamber.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当他再次醒来，天已黑暗。起初完全混沌，但过了一会儿，床的轮廓在周围模糊浮现。床幔虽已放下，但他可以看出雕花床柱，以及头顶的天鹅绒顶篷。身下是柔顺的羽床，头后是鹅毛枕。我自己的床，我睡在自己的羽床上，这是我自己的卧室。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He would have asked one of the silent sisters, but when he tried to speak he found he had no mouth. Smooth seamless skin covered his teeth. The discovery terrified him. How could he live without a mouth? He began to run. The city was not far. He would be safe inside the city, away from all these dead. He did not belong with the dead. He had no mouth, but he was still a living man. No, a lion, a lion, and alive. But when he reached the city walls, the gates were shut against him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他向其中一位修女打听，却赫然发现自己没有嘴，平整的皮肤覆盖牙齿，一点缝隙也无。他吓坏了，没有嘴巴怎么活？于是他开始奔跑，奔向不远处的城市。只要进城，远离这些死人，就安全了。他没有死，虽然嘴巴消失，但依旧是个活人。不，不，我是一头雄狮，雄狮，生龙活虎的雄狮。他好不容易跑到城下，城门却对他紧闭。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was warm inside the drapes, under the great heap of furs and blankets that covered him. He was sweating. Fever, he thought groggily. He felt so weak, and the pain stabbed through him when he struggled to lift his hand. He gave up the effort. His head felt enormous, as big as the bed, too heavy to raise from the pillow. His body he could scarcely feel at all. How did I come here? He tried to remember. The battle came back in fits and flashes. The fight along the river, the knight who'd offered up his gauntlet, the bridge of ships…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="床幔内很暖和，又有一大堆毛皮和毯子盖着。汗水。我在发烧，他晕乎乎地想。如此虚脱，连抬手的动作，都惹起袭向全身的疼痛，于是他放弃了努力。头好大，像床那么大，重得无法离开枕头。而整个身体都丧失了知觉。我怎么到这儿来的？他努力回忆。战斗的片断零零星星地在脑中闪现。河边的战斗，献上护手的骑士，废船构成的桥…">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ser Mandon. He saw the dead empty eyes, the reaching hand, the green fire shining against the white enamel plate. Fear swept over him in a cold rush; beneath the sheets he could feel his bladder letting go. He would have cried out, if he'd had a mouth. No, that was the dream, he thought, his head pounding. Help me, someone help me. Jaime, Shae, Mother, someone… Tysha…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="曼登爵士。他仿佛又看到那双木讷的眼睛，那只伸出的手，还有映在釉彩白甲上的绿火。恐惧如冰冷的激流，贯穿全身，他再度尿了床。如果有嘴，想必自己会狂呼乱叫。不，不，这是梦，他心想，脑袋砰砰直响。救我，谁来救我。詹姆，雪伊，圣母，谁来救我…泰莎…">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">No one heard. No one came. Alone in the dark, he fell back into pissscented sleep. He dreamed his sister was standing over his bed, with their lord father beside her, frowning. It had to be a dream, since Lord Tywin was a thousand leagues away, fighting Robb Stark in the west. Others came and went as well. Varys looked down on him and sighed, but Littlefinger made a quip. Bloody treacherous bastard, Tyrion thought venomously, we sent you to Bitterbridge and you never came back. Sometimes he could hear them talking to one another, but he did not understand the words. Their voices buzzed in his ears like wasps muffled in thick felt.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没人听见。没人过来。他在屎尿和黑暗中再度独眠。这一次，他梦见姐姐站在床前，旁边是一如既往板着脸孔的父亲大人。好一个梦啊，泰温公爵想必远在千里之外的西境，与罗柏·史塔克作战罢。还有其他人来来去去。瓦里斯低头观看，叹了口气，小指头则拿他开玩笑。该死，你这背信弃义的混蛋，提利昂恶狠狠地想，我们送你到苦桥，你却一去不回。有时他听见他们互相交谈，却不懂他们的语言，只有声音在耳边嗡嗡作响，好似被厚毛毡捂住一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He wanted to ask if they'd won the battle. We must have, else I'd be a head on a spike somewhere. If I live, we won. He did not know what pleased him more: the victory, or the fact he had been able to reason it out. His wits were coming back to him, however slowly. That was good. His wits were all he had.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他想知道战役赢了没有。我们一定赢了，否则我的头早被挂在枪上。既然我还活着，我们一定赢了。他不知哪件事更令他高兴：胜利，还是恢复了些许思考的能力。太棒了，不管多慢，他的头脑正在恢复。这是他惟一的武器。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A short while later Pod reappeared. This time a stranger was with him, a maester chained and robed. "My lord, you must be still," the man murmured. "You are grievous hurt. You will do yourself great injury. Are you thirsty?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不久，波德再次出现，跟了一个陌生人，一个戴项链、穿长袍的学士。“大人，您千万别动，”来人喃喃道，“您伤得很重，贸然行动对身体不利。渴吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He managed an awkward nod. The maester inserted a curved copper funnel through the feeding hole over his mouth and poured a slow trickle down his throat. Tyrion swallowed, scarcely tasting. Too late he realized the liquid was milk of the poppy. By the time the maester removed the funnel from his mouth, he was already spiraling back to sleep.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他好容易笨拙地点点头，学士便将一个弯曲的铜漏斗通过进食孔插入他口中，缓缓灌入一些液体。提利昂别无选择，便吞咽下去，当意识到这是罂粟花奶时，已经太迟。学士将漏斗从嘴边移开，他回到梦中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The next time he woke, the draperies had been pulled back, and Podrick Payne stood over him with a candle. When he saw Tyrion open his eyes he ran off. No, don't go, help me, help, he tried to call, but the best he could do was a muffled moan. I have no mouth. He raised a hand to his face, his every movement pained and fumbling. His fingers found stiff cloth where they should have found flesh, lips, teeth. Linen. The lower half of his face was bandaged tightly, a mask of hardened plaster with holes for breathing and feeding.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="下次醒来，床幔已被拉开，波德瑞克·派恩拿着蜡烛站在旁边。他看见提利昂睁开双眼，拔腿就跑。不，别走，救我，救救我，他想大喊，但用尽全力也出不了声，只发出一下闷哼。我没有嘴。他抬手摸脸，每个动作都痛苦而笨拙。他的手指在原本该是血肉、嘴唇和牙齿的地方找到一块硬梆梆的东西。亚麻布。他的下半边脸被紧紧包扎，凝结的膏药面具上只留呼吸和进食的孔。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He woke in darkness to a cold empty room. The draperies had been drawn again. Something felt wrong, turned around, though he could not have said what. He was alone once more. Pushing back the blankets, he tried to sit, but the pain was too much and he soon subsided, breathing raggedly. His face was the least part of it. His right side was one huge ache, and a stab of pain went through his chest whenever he lifted his arm. What's happened to me? Even the battle seemed half a dream when he tried to think back on it. I was hurt more badly than I knew Ser Mandon…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他又在黑暗中醒来，面对空旷寒冷的房间。床幔再度放下。有些事不大对劲，发生了什么变化，但他说不出所以然。他孤身一人，推开毯子，想坐起来，但疼痛实在太厉害，很快就得停止行动，一边急促地喘气。脸上的疼最轻微，整个右半身则剧痛无比，而每次举手，胸口便一阵刺痛。我到底怎么了？他努力去想，战斗的场景如梦幻一般。我似乎没受重伤啊…曼登爵士…">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This time he dreamed he was at a feast, a victory feast in some great hall. He had a high seat on the dais, and men were lifting their goblets and hailing him as hero. Marillion was there, the singer who'd journeyed with them through the Mountains of the Moon. He played his woodharp and sang of the imp's daring deeds. Even his father was smiling with approval. When the song was over, Jaime rose from his place, commanded Tyrion to kneel, and touched him first on one shoulder and then on the other with his golden sword, and he rose up a knight. Shae was waiting to embrace him. She took him by the hand, laughing and teasing, calling him her giant of Lannister.</div>

<div class="line_en">The memory frightened him, but Tyrion made himself hold it, turn it in his head, stare at it hard. He tried to kill me, no mistake. That part was not a dream. He would have cut me in half if Pod had not… Pod, where's Pod?</div>

<div class="line_en">Gritting his teeth, he grabbed hold of the bed hangings and yanked. The drapes ripped free of the canopy overhead and tumbled down, half on the rushes and half on him. Even that small effort had dizzied him. The room whirled around him, all bare walls and dark shadows, with a single narrow window. He saw a chest he'd owned, an untidy pile of his clothing, his battered armor. This is not my bedchamber, he realized. Not even the Tower of the Hand. Someone had moved him. His shout of anger came out as a muffled moan. They have moved me here to die, he thought as he gave up the struggle and closed his eyes once more. The room was dank and cold, and he was burning.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他咬牙抓住床幔，使劲一拽。幔帐脱离顶篷，跌落下来，一半压在身上，一边落到草席。稍一用力便令他头晕眼花，房间在周围旋转，光秃的墙和黑暗的阴影，一扇窄窗。他还看到属于自己的一只箱子，一堆乱七八糟的衣服和伤痕累累的铠甲。这不是我的卧室，他意识到，甚至不在首相塔里。有人给他换了地方！他愤怒地喊叫，发出的却是含糊的呻吟。他们把我移到这儿——等死！他一边想，一边放弃挣扎，再次合眼。房间潮湿阴冷，他却浑身发烫。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He dreamed of a better place, a snug little cottage by the sunset sea. The walls were lopsided and cracked and the floor had been made of packed earth, but he had always been warm there, even when they let the fire go out. She used to tease me about that, he remembered. I never thought to feed the fire, that had always been a servant's task. "We have no servants," she would remind me, and I would say, "You have me, I'm your servant," and she would say, "A lazy servant. What do they do with lazy servants in Casterly Rock, my lord?" and he would tell her, "They kiss them." That would always make her giggle. "They do not neither. They beat them, I bet," she would say, but he would insist, "No, they kiss them, just like this." He would show her how. "They kiss their fingers first, every one, and they kiss their wrists, yes, and inside their elbows. Then they kiss their funny ears, all our servants have funny ears. Stop laughing! And they kiss their cheeks and they kiss their noses with the little bump in them, there, so, like that, and they kiss their sweet brows and their hair and their lips, their… mmmm… mouths… so…"</div>

You must not fight, no, don't try to move, you need your rest." He had the copper funnel in one damp pink hand and a flask in the other.</div>

<div class="line_en">As the man leaned close, Tyrion's fingers slid underneath his chain of many metals, grabbed, pulled. The maester dropped the flask, spilling milk of the poppy all over the blanket. Tyrion twisted until he could feel the links digging into the flesh of the man's fat neck. "No. More," he croaked, so hoarse he was not certain he had even spoken. But he must have, for the maester choked out a reply.

<div class="line_en">Bowing, the man left the room, only to return a few moments later, bearing a long knife with a slender sawtooth blade, a basin of water, a pile of soft cloths, and several flasks. By then Tyrion had managed to squirm backward a few inches, so he was half sitting against his pillow. The maester bade him be very still as he slid the tip of the knife in under his chin, beneath the mask. A slip of the hand here, and Cersei will be free of me, he thought. He could feel the blade sawing through the stiffened linen, only inches above his throat.</div>

<div class="line_en">Fortunately this soft pink man was not one of his sister's braver creatures. After a moment he felt cool air on his cheeks. There was pain as well, but he did his best to ignore that. The maester discarded the bandages, still crusty with potion. "Be still now, I must wash out the wound." His touch was gentle, the water warm and soothing. The wound, Tyrion thought, remembering a sudden flash of bright silver that seemed to pass just below his eyes. "This is like to sting some," the maester warned as he wet a cloth with wine that smelled of crushed herbs. It did more than sting. It traced a line of fire all the way across Tyrion's face, and twisted a burning poker up his nose. His fingers clawed the bedclothes and he sucked in his breath, but somehow he managed not to scream. The maester was clucking like an old hen. "It would have been wiser to leave the mask in place until the flesh had knit, my lord. Still, it looks clean, good, good. When we found you down in that cellar among the dead and dying, your wounds were filthy. One of your ribs was broken, doubtless you can feel it, the blow of some mace perhaps, or a fall, it's hard to say. And you took an arrow in the arm, there where it joins the shoulder. It showed signs of mortification, and for a time I feared you might lose the limb, but we treated it with boiling wine and maggots, and now it seems to be healing clean…"</div>

<div class="line_en">He remembered now. The bridge of boats, Ser Mandon Moore, a hand, a sword coming at his face. If I had not pulled back, that cut would have taken off the top of my head. Jaime had always said that Ser Mandon was the most dangerous of the Kingsguard, because his dead empty eyes gave no hint to his intentions. I should never have trusted any of them. He'd known that Ser Meryn and Ser Boros were his sister's, and Ser Osmund later, but he had let himself believe that the others were not wholly lost to honor. Cersei must have paid him to see that I never came back from the battle. Why else? I never did Ser Mandon any harm that I know of.
