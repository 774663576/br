<div class="line_en">At six the alarm went off. Karenin's great moment had arrived. He always woke up much earlier than they did, but did not dare to disturb them. He would wait impatiently for the alarm, because it gave him the right to jump up on their bed, trample their bodies, and butt them with his muzzle. For a time they had tried to curb him and pushed him off the bed, but he was more headstrong than they were and ended by defending his rights. Lately, Tereza realized, she positively enjoyed being welcomed into the day by Karenin. Waking up was sheer delight for him: he always showed a naive and simple amazement at the discovery that he was back on earth; he was sincerely pleased. She, on the other hand, awoke with great reluctance with a desire to stave off the day by keeping her eyes closed.</div>

<div class="line_en">When Tereza came home, it was almost half past one in the morning. She went into the bathroom, put on her pajamas, and lay down next to Tomas. He was asleep. She leaned over his face and, kissing it, detected a curious aroma coming from his hair. She took another whiff and yet another. She sniffed him up and down like a dog before realizing what it was: the aroma of a woman's sex organs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特蕾莎在将近凌晨一点半回到家，走进浴室，换上睡衣，在托马斯身边躺下。他睡熟了。她靠近他的脸，正要吻他的嘴唇，这时，发现他的头发里有一种奇怪的气味。她久久地探着鼻子。她像条狗一样嗅他，终于明白了：这是一种女人的气味，女人下体的气味。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Now he was standing in the entrance hall, gazing up at the hat stand, where his leash and collar hung ready. She slipped his head through the collar, and off they went together to do the shopping. She needed to pick up some milk, butter, and bread and, as usual, his morning roll. Later, he trotted back alongside her, roll in mouth, looking proudly from side to side, gratified by the attention he attracted from the passersby.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此时，卡列宁在门口等着，抬头盯着衣帽架，那上面挂着它的项圈和皮带。特蕾莎给它套上项圈，带它去买东西。特蕾莎买牛奶、面包和黄油，像往常一样，也给它买一块羊角面包。在回家的路上，卡列宁在她身边一路小跑，嘴里叼着羊角面包。它骄傲地环顾四周，也许为自己受到注意，被人用手指点而陶醉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This time, however, he waited in vain for his morning ritual. Tomas had a small transistor radio on the table in front of him and was listening to it intently.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但这一次，它等待的这场早晨的仪式却落了空。桌上放着一台半导体收音机，托马斯正在听着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Once home, he would stretch out with his roll on the threshold of the bedroom and wait for Tomas to take notice of him, creep up to him, snarl at him, and make believe he was trying to snatch his roll away from him. That was how it went every day. Not until they had chased each other through the flat for at least five minutes would Karenin scramble under a table and gobble up the roll.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到了家，它嘴里咬着面包，潜伏在卧室门口，等着托马斯发现它的存在，蹲下身来怪叫，装作要抢走它的面包。每天都如此一番：他们要花上五分钟在房里追逐，直到卡列宁躲到桌下去，快速地一口吞下面包。">查看中文翻译</div>
