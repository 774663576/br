<div class="line_en">Winter has begun to withdraw by the time my foot is deemed usable. My mother gives me exercises to do and lets me walk on my own a bit. I go to sleep one night, determined to go into town the next morning, but I awake to find Venia, Octavia, and Flavius grinning down at me.</div>

<div class="line_en">Staying quietly in bed is harder after that. I want to be doing something, finding out more about District 13 or helping in the cause to bring down the Capitol.

More people being punished or dropping from starvation.</div>

<div class="line_en">After the usual histrionics about the deteriorated state of my beauty, they get right down to business. Their biggest concern is my face, although I think my mother did a pretty remarkable job healing it. There's just a pale pink strip across my cheekbone. The whipping's not common knowledge, so I tell them I slipped on the ice and cut it. And then I realize that's my same excuse for hurting my foot, which is going to make walking in high heels a problem. But Flavius, Octavia, and Venia aren't the suspicious types, so I'm safe there.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在照例对我越来越糟的皮肤状况进行一番抱怨之后，他们马上行动起来。他们最关心的是我的脸，尽管妈妈已经精心护理，尽量不留下疤痕，但颊骨上还是有一道淡粉色的痕迹。鞭打不是人人都懂的常识，所以我告诉他们我在冰上滑了一下，割了道口子。之后，我意识到这同样可以作为我摔伤脚后跟的理由，这就是说，穿高跟鞋走路会很困难。好在弗莱维、奥克塔维亚和维妮娅不是那种好怀疑的人，我在他们这里倒是安全的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Since I only have to look hairless for a few hours instead of several weeks, I get to be shaved instead of waxed. I still have to soak in a tub of something, but it isn't vile, and we're on to my hair and makeup before I know it. The team, as usual, is full of news, which I usually do my best to tune out. But then Octavia makes a comment that catches my attention. It's a passing remark, really, about how she couldn't get shrimp for a party, but it tugs at me.</div>

<div class="line_en">I begin to question them casually about what other hardships this winter has brought them. They are not used to want, so any little disruption in supply makes an impact on them. By the time I'm ready to be dressed, their complaints about the difficulty of getting different products -- from crabmeat to music chips to ribbons -- has given me a sense of which districts might actually be rebelling. Seafood from District 4. Electronic gadgets from District 3. And, of course, fabrics from District 8. The thought of such widespread rebellion has me quivering with fear and excitement.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我开始漫不经心地问起他们今年冬天还有哪些困难，他们不习惯于物品短缺，所以一些供货的小小中断就会使他们不适。到了我该穿婚纱的时候，他们的抱怨已经成堆了…蟹到音乐盘，再到丝带，不是缺这就是少那…以至于对哪个从螃区真的发生反叛，我的脑子里也一片混乱。海鲜来自四区，电器元件来自三区，而，当然了，纺织品来自八区。一想到这么多区都可能出现了反叛，我感到既兴奋，又害怕。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I want to ask them more, but Cinna appears to give me a hug and check my makeup. His attention goes right to the scar on my cheek. Somehow I don't think he believes the slipping-on-the-ice story, but he doesn't question it. He simply adjusts the powder on my face, and what little you can see of the lash mark vanishes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我想再多问些，但此时西纳进来了，他拥抱了我，然后检查给我化的妆。他一下子就注意到我脸上的印痕。不知怎的，我觉得他不会相信我在冰上摔了一跤的托辞，但他并没有问。他只是把我脸上的粉又重新补了补，那道淡淡的印痕便消失了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Evening has fallen and my foot hurts from all the crazy shoes, so I abandon any thoughts of going into town. Instead I go upstairs and wash away the layers of makeup and conditioners and dyes and then go down to dry my hair by the fire. Prim, who came home from school in time to see the last two dresses, chatters on about them with my mother. They both seem overly happy about the photo shoot. When I fall into bed, I realize it's because they think it means I'm safe. That the Capitol has overlooked my interference with the whipping since no one is going to go to such trouble and expense for someone they plan on killing, anyway. Right.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="夜幕已经降临，我穿了一天那些该死的鞋子，脚真是疼死了，去城里的念头也只好打消了。我上楼，洗掉了厚厚的化妆品、润肤霜、染料，然后下楼到壁炉边烘干头发。波丽姆放学回家后正好看到我拍最后两套婚纱照，此时她坐在一边正和妈妈聊着这些事。她们对拍婚纱照都兴奋异常。我上床之后才意识到，她们之所以这么高兴是因为她们觉得我已经安全了，凯匹特已经不会在意我参与了鞭打盖尔的事件，因为不管怎样，他们不会对一个即将被处死的人费这么大工夫。没错，是这样的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Downstairs, the living room has been cleared and lit for the photo shoot. Effie's having a fine time ordering everybody around, keeping us all on schedule. It's probably a good thing, because there are six gowns and each one requires its own headpiece, shoes, jewelry, hair, makeup, setting, and lighting. Creamy lace and pink roses and ringlets. Ivory satin and gold tattoos and greenery. A sheath of diamonds and jeweled veil and moonlight. Heavy white silk and sleeves that fall from my wrist to the floor, and pearls. The moment one shot has been approved, we move right into preparing for the next. I feel like dough, being kneaded and reshaped again and again. My mother manages to feed me bits of food and sips of tea while they work on me, but by the time the shoot is over, I'm starving and exhausted. I'm hoping to spend some time with Cinna now, but Effie whisks everybody out the door and I have to make do with the promise of a phone call.</div>

<div class="line_en">I eat breakfast with my mother and Prim and head out in search of a confidant. The air's warm with hopeful hints of spring in it. Spring would be a good time for an uprising, I think. Everyone feels less vulnerable once winter passes. Peeta's not home. I guess he's already gone into town. I'm surprised to see Haymitch moving around his kitchen so early, though. I walk into his house without knocking. I can hear Hazelle upstairs, sweeping the floors of the now-spotless house. Haymitch isn't flat-out drunk, but he doesn't look too steady, either. I guess the rumors about Ripper being back in business are true. I'm thinking maybe I better let him just go to bed, when he suggests a walk to town.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我和妈妈，波丽姆一起吃了早饭之后就出门了。外面微风和煦，已有了春的气息。春天应该是发起暴动的好时机。严冬已过去，大家的心也逐渐坚强起来。皮塔没在家，我猜他已进城去了。到了黑密斯家，看到他这么早就在厨房里走动，还是很惊讶。我没有敲门，直接走了进去。我能听到黑兹尔在楼上忙碌着，正在打扫已收拾得纤尘不染的房间地板。黑密斯没有酩酊大醉，但他走路还是摇摇晃晃的。有传闻说，瑞珀又干上了私酒买卖，我猜这是真的。我正想着是不是应该劝他上床睡觉，他却说要去城里走走。">查看中文翻译</div>

In the few minutes of privacy we've had, with me walking him back to town, I gather that the rumblings of an uprising in 12 have been subdued by Thread's crackdown. He knows I'm not going to run.

<div class="line_en">I see now how they could photograph me yesterday and present the special tonight. Initially, Cinna designed two dozen wedding gowns. Since then, there's been the process of narrowing down the designs, creating the dresses, and choosing the accessories. Apparently, in the Capitol, there were opportunities to vote for your favorites at each stage. This is all culminating with shots of me in the final six dresses, which I'm sure took no time at all to insert in the show. Each shot is met with a huge reaction from the crowd. People screaming and cheering for their favorites, booing the ones they don't like. Having voted, and probably bet on the winner, people are very invested in my wedding gown. It's bizarre to watch when I think how I never even bothered to try one on before the cameras arrived. Caesar announces that interested parties must cast their final vote by noon on the following day.</div>

<div class="line_en">The anthem plays, and my throat tightens with revulsion as President Snow takes the stage. He's followed by a young boy dressed in a white suit, holding a simple wooden box. The anthem ends, and President Snow begins to speak, to remind us all of the Dark Days from which the Hunger Games were born. When the laws for the Games were laid out, they dictated that every twenty-five years the anniversary would be marked by a Quarter Quell. It would call for a glorified version of the Games to make fresh the memory of those killed by the districts' rebellion.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="国歌响起，斯诺总统走向前台，我的心提到了嗓子眼。他身后跟着一个穿白色西服的小男孩，手里拿着一个木盒子。国歌结束后，斯诺总统开始讲话。他提醒大家要牢记“黑暗岁月”，正是在那时开始了饥饿游戏，也是在那时制定了饥饿游戏的规则，即：每二十五年，就要举办一次饥饿游戏的“世纪极限赛”，极限赛要比以往任何一届比赛都更隆重盛大，以铭记被叛乱夺去生命的人们。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"And now we honor our third Quarter Quell," says the president. The little boy in white steps forward, holding out the box as he opens the lid. We can see the tidy, upright rows of yellowed envelopes. Whoever devised the Quarter Quell system had prepared for centuries of Hunger Games. The president removes an envelope clearly marked with a 75. He runs his finger under the flap and pulls out a small square of paper. Without hesitation, he reads, "On the seventy-fifth anniversary, as a reminder to the rebels that even the strongest among them cannot overcome the power of the Capitol, the male and female tributes will be reaped from their existing pool of victors."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“现在，我们要开始隆重的第三次世纪极限赛。”总统说道。身着白色西服的小男孩手举着木盒，上前一步，总统把盒子打开。我们可以看到盒子里整齐码放着一排排黄色的信封。无论是谁设计了世纪极限赛，他已经为游戏做好了几个世纪延续下去的准备。总统拿起了一个清楚地标有七十五的信封，用手指划过信封的封盖，从里面抽出一张小方卡片。之后，没有丝毫停顿，他念道：“为了提醒反叛者，即使他们中最强壮的人都无法战胜凯匹特，七十五届饥饿游戏世纪极限赛男女贡品将从现有的胜利者中选出。”">查看中文翻译</div>
