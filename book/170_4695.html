<div class="line_en">Aye, they would. It all fit. That did not mean Barristan Selmy liked it any better. "That will not happen." His queen was the Mother of Dragons; he would not allow her children to come to harm. "The hour of the wolf. The blackest part of night, when all the world's asleep." He had first heard those words from Tywin Lannister outside the walls of Duskendale. He gave me a day to bring out Aerys. Unless I returned with the king by dawn of the following day, he would take the town with steel and fire, he told me. It was the hour of the wolf when I went in and the hour of the wolf when we emerged. "Grey Worm and the Unsullied will close and bar the gates at first light."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="是的，他们会的。应该会这样。但这不意味着巴利斯坦—赛尔弥会喜欢。“不会如此的。”他的女王是龙之母，他绝不会请允许她的孩子们受到伤害。“那就在狼时。夜色最浓，全世界都睡觉的时候。”他最早听到这些话是在暮谷城外，从泰温—兰尼斯特那里。他给我一天时间找出伊里斯。要是第二天早上我不能带着国王回来，他就会血洗城镇，他这么告诉我。我就是在狼时进去然后我们也是狼时出来的。“灰虫子和他的无垢者军团明天一早就会锁上大门。”">查看中文翻译</div>

If we do not act, Hizdahr will hesitate for a time, to give proof of his reluctance and allow the Wise Masters the chance to rid him of the Stormcrow and the bloodrider. Then he will act.

<div class="line_en">That much was true, Selmy knew. Symon Stripeback of the Free Brothers and Mollono Yos Dob of the Stalwart Shields were both eager for battle, intent on proving themselves and washing out all the wrongs they had suffered in a tide of Yunkish blood. Only Marselen of the Mother's Men shared Ser Barristan's doubts. "We discussed this. You agreed it would be my way."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是实情，赛尔弥清楚。自由兄弟团的赛蒙—斯催普拜克和卫士之盾牌的莫罗诺—耶斯—多博都渴望着战斗，为了洗雪渊凯人带来的耻辱给自己正名。只有母亲之子的马瑟伦和巴利斯坦有相同的顾虑。“我们讨论过这个了。你答应按我的法子来。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“不。”他们之前已经争论过这个。“这是女王亲手缔造的和平，我们不会首先来打破它。我们一抓住哈兹达尔，就组成一个议事会来代替他统治，要求渊凯人归还我们的人质并且撤兵。他们拒绝的话，只有那时我们才会告诉他们和约打破了，然后和他们做战。你的方式不光彩。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"He will not escape." Selmy did not fear Khrazz, much less Steelskin. They were only pit fighters. Hizdahr's fearsome collection of former fighting slaves made indifferent guards at best. Speed and strength and ferocity they had, and some skill at arms as well, but blood games were poor training for protecting kings. In the pits their foes were announced with horns and drums, and after the battle was done and won the victors could have their wounds bound up and quaff some milk of the poppy for the pain, knowing that the threat was past and they were free to drink and feast and whore until the next fight. But the battle was never truly done for a knight of the Kingsguard. Threats came from everywhere and nowhere, at any time of day or night. No trumpets announced the foe: vassals, servants, friends, brothers, sons, even wives, any of them might have knives concealed beneath their cloaks and murder hidden in their hearts. For every hour of fighting, a Kingsguard knight spent ten thousand hours watching, waiting, standing silent in the shadows. King Hizdahr's pit fighters were already growing bored and restive with their new duties, and bored men were lax, slow to react.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他跑不了的。”赛尔弥不怕卡拉兹，更不在意钢皮。他们只不过是角斗士。哈兹达尔那些让人畏惧的前角斗士奴隶做警卫不一样，他们有速度，力量也够凶猛，有些还有点兵器使用技巧，但那些血腥游戏对于保卫国王来说没什么用。在角斗场他们的敌人是由号角和鼓声预先宣告的，打完胜仗后他们就可以包扎伤口，喝点罂粟牛奶止痛，心知危险已经过去，他们可以在下次战斗前尽情的吃喝嫖赌。但对一个国王卫队的骑士来说，战斗从来没有终结。威胁无时无处不在，不会有喇叭宣告敌人的到来，属臣们，仆人们，朋友们，兄弟们，儿子们，甚至妻子人，任何人都可能在斗篷下面藏着刀子，心里暗藏杀机。每一小时的作战，国王卫人的骑士都要花上万小时来守望，静静地站在阴影里。而哈兹达尔国王的斗士们已经对他们的新职责感到无聊和厌倦了。无聊的人会放松，会反应迟钝。">查看中文翻译</div>

Prince Rhaegar loved his Lady Lyanna, and thousands died for it. Daemon Blackfyre loved the first Daenerys, and rose in rebellion when denied her. Bittersteel and Bloodraven both loved Shiera Seastar, and the Seven Kingdoms bled. The Prince of Dragonflies loved Jenny of Oldstones so much he cast aside a crown, and Westeros paid the bride price in corpses. All three of the sons of the fifth Aegon had wed for love, in defiance of their father's wishes. And because that unlikely monarch had himself followed his heart when he chose his queen, he allowed his sons to have their way, making bitter enemies where he might have had fast friends.

<div class="line_en">Some of them had been training for the fighting pits when Daenerys Targaryen took Meereen and freed them from their chains. Those had had a good acquaintance with sword and spear and battle-axe even before Ser Barristan got hold of them. A few might well be ready. The boy from the Basilisk Isles, for a start. Tumco Lho. Black as maester's ink he was, but fast and strong, the best natural swordsman Selmy had seen since Jaime Lannister. Larraq as well. The Lash. Ser Barristan did not approve of his fighting style, but there was no doubting his skills. Larraq had years of work ahead of him before he mastered proper knightly weapons, sword and lance and mace, but he was deadly with his whip and trident. The old knight had warned him that the whip would be useless against an armored foe… until he saw how Larraq used it, snapping it around the legs of his opponents to yank them off their feet. No knight as yet, but a fierce fighter.</div>

<div class="line_en">That made six. Six out of twenty-seven. Selmy might have hoped for more, but six was a good beginning. The other boys were younger for the most part, and more familiar with looms and plows and chamber pots than swords and shields, but they worked hard and learned quickly. A few years as squires, and he might have six more knights to give his queen. As for those who would never be ready, well, not every boy was meant to be a knight. The realm needs candlemakers and innkeeps and armorers as well. That was as true in Meereen as it was in Westeros.</div>

<div class="line_en">As he watched them at their drills, Ser Barristan pondered raising Tumco and Larraq to knighthood then and there, and mayhaps the Red Lamb too. It required a knight to make a knight, and if something should go awry tonight, dawn might find him dead or in a dungeon. Who would dub his squires then? On the other hand, a young knight's repute derived at least in part from the honor of the man who conferred knighthood on him. It would do his lads no good at all if it was known that they were given their spurs by a traitor, and might well land them in the dungeon next to him. They deserve better, Ser Barristan decided. Better a long life as a squire than a short one as a soiled knight.</div>

<div class="line_en">Outside the carved hardwood doors to the king's chambers stood Steel-skin, a younger pit fighter, not yet regarded as of the first rank. His cheeks and brow were scarred with intricate tattoos in green and black, ancient Valyrian sorcerer's signs that supposedly made his flesh and skin as hard as steel. Similar markings covered his chest and arms, though whether they would actually stop a sword or axe remained to be seen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在国王套房雕花硬木大门外站着钢皮，一个年轻的角斗士，还算不得第一流的。他的脸上是绿色和黑色的复杂纹身，是古老的瓦拉里尔巫术记号，用于把他的皮肉变得坚硬如铁。相似的记呈还在他的脸上和胳膊上，虽然现在还不知道他们能不能挡住剑或斧头。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dark and windowless, surrounded on all sides by brick walls eight feet thick, the chambers that the king had made his own were large and luxurious within. Great beams of black oak supported the high ceilings. The floors were covered with silk carpets out of Qarth. On the walls were priceless tapestries, ancient and much faded, depicting the glory of the Old Empire of Ghis. The largest of them showed the last survivors of a defeated Valyrian army passing beneath the yoke and being chained. The archway leading to the royal bedchamber was guarded by a pair of sandalwood lovers, shaped and smoothed and oiled. Ser Barristan found them distasteful, though no doubt they were meant to be arousing. The sooner we are gone from this place, the better.</div>

<div class="line_en">Selmy blocked the cuts at his head and let his armor stop the rest, whilst his own blade opened the pit fighter's cheek from ear to mouth, then traced a raw red gash across his chest. Blood welled from Khrazz's wounds. That only seemed to make him wilder. He seized the brazier with his off hand and flipped it, scattering embers and hot coals at Selmy's feet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="塞尔米堵住了头上的伤口，让他的盔甲挡住了其余的伤口，同时他自己的刀锋从耳朵到嘴把斗士的脸颊从耳朵到嘴张开，然后在他的胸口划出一道鲜红的伤口。血从赫拉兹的伤口涌出。这只会让他变得更加狂野。他用左手抓住火盆，翻了翻，把余烬和热煤撒在塞尔米的脚边。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Die," spat Khrazz… but as he lifted his arakh, its tip grazed one of the wall hangings and hung. That was all the chance Ser Barristan required.

<div class="line_en">"Few do. Yet all men die, regardless." Ser Barristan sheathed his sword and pulled Hizdahr to his feet. "Come. I will escort you to a cell." By now, the Brazen Beasts should have disarmed Steelskin. "You will be kept a prisoner until the queen returns. If nothing can be proved against you, you will not come to harm. You have my word as a knight." He took the king's arm and led him from the bedchamber, feeling strangely light-headed, almost drunk. I was a Kingsguard. What am I now?</div>
