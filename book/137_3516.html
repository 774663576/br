<div class="line_en">Gringoire, a practical philosopher of the streets of Paris, had noticed that nothing is more propitious to revery than following a pretty woman without knowing whither she is going. There was in this voluntary abdication of his freewill, in this fancy submitting itself to another fancy, which suspects it not, a mixture of fantastic independence and blind obedience, something indescribable, intermediate between slavery and liberty, which pleased Gringoire,-- a spirit essentially compound, undecided, and complex, holding the extremities of all extremes, incessantly suspended between all human propensities, and neutralizing one by the other. He was fond of comparing himself to Mahomet's coffin, attracted in two different directions by two loadstones, and hesitating eternally between the heights and the depths, between the vault and the pavement, between fall and ascent, between zenith and nadir.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Here are streets which possess but little logic!" said Gringoire, lost in the thousands of circuits which returned upon themselves incessantly, but where the young girl pursued a road which seemed familiar to her, without hesitation and with a step which became ever more rapid. As for him, he would have been utterly ignorant of his situation had he not espied, in passing, at the turn of a street, the octagonal mass of the pillory of the fish markets, the open-work summit of which threw its black, fretted outlines clearly upon a window which was still lighted in the Rue Verdelet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“瞧，这些街道简直不讲逻辑！”格兰古瓦说。他迷失在不断兜圈子的千百条罗盘路中，但是，那女郎寸步不乱，道路似乎异常熟悉，连想都不想，举步就走，步子还越走越快。至于格兰古瓦，他简直就要不知道自己在哪儿了，——要不是转过一条街道，偶尔瞥见菜市场那儿的八角形耻辱柱的雕花尖顶的黑影强烈地投射在韦德莱街一家亮着灯的窗户上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The young girl's attention had been attracted to him for the last few moments; she had repeatedly turned her head towards him with uneasiness; she had even once come to a standstill, and taking advantage of a ray of light which escaped from a half-open bakery to survey him intently, from head to foot, then, having cast this glance, Gringoire had seen her make that little pout which he had already noticed, after which she passed on.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他引起姑娘的注意已经好一会儿了。她多次忐忑不安地掉头看看他；有一次甚至利用一家微启店门的面包房透出的灯光，猛然站住，瞪着眼睛上下打量他。她这样看了看他，格兰古瓦看见她又像先前那样噘了噘嘴唇，然后再也不去管他了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This little pout had furnished Gringoire with food for thought. There was certainly both disdain and mockery in that graceful grimace. So he dropped his head, began to count the paving-stones, and to follow the young girl at a little greater distance, when, at the turn of a street, which had caused him to lose sight of her, he heard her utter a piercing cry.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她这一撇嘴，促使格兰古瓦不能不考虑了。这样优美的娇态中肯定包含着轻蔑嘲弄的意味。于是，他低下头来，放慢了脚步，同女郎保持一段距离，落在后面远了点儿。然后，她拐过一个街角，他刚刚看不见她，就听见她尖叫一声。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The street was full of shadows. Nevertheless, a twist of tow soaked in oil, which burned in a cage at the feet of the Holy Virgin at the street corner, permitted Gringoire to make out the gypsy struggling in the arms of two men, who were endeavoring to stifle her cries. The poor little goat, in great alarm, lowered his horns and bleated.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那条街道漆黑，但是，拐角圣处女像下有一个铁笼子，里面燃烧着油捻，格兰古瓦借着亮光，看见有两个男人正搂着吉卜赛女郎，堵住她的嘴，不让她叫喊，她在拼命挣扎。可怜的小山羊吓得要死，牴着两只角，咩咩直叫。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Help! gentlemen of the watch!" shouted Gringoire, and advanced bravely. One of the men who held the young girl turned towards him. It was the formidable visage of Quasimodo.</div>

<div class="line_en">He tore the gypsy from the arms of the dazed Quasimodo, threw her across his saddle, and at the moment when the terrible hunchback, recovering from his surprise, rushed upon him to regain his prey, fifteen or sixteen archers, who followed their captain closely, made their appearance, with their two-edged swords in their fists.
