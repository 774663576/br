<div class="line_en">Dorothy had only one other dress, but that happened to be clean and was hanging on a peg beside her bed. It was gingham, with checks of white and blue; and although the blue was somewhat faded with many washings, it was still a pretty frock. The girl washed herself carefully, dressed herself in the clean gingham, and tied her pink sunbonnet on her head. She took a little basket and filled it with bread from the cupboard, laying a white cloth over the top. Then she looked down at her feet and noticed how old and worn her shoes were.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then she went back to the house, and having helped herself and Toto to a good drink of the cool, clear water, she set about making ready for the journey to the City of Emeralds.</div>

<div class="line_en">When Dorothy was left alone she began to feel hungry. So she went to the cupboard and cut herself some bread, which she spread with butter. She gave some to Toto, and taking a pail from the shelf she carried it down to the little brook and filled it with clear, sparkling water. Toto ran over to the trees and began to bark at the birds sitting there. Dorothy went to get him, and saw such delicious fruit hanging from the branches that she gathered some of it, finding it just what she wanted to help out her breakfast.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="多萝茜只剩独个儿了，她觉得饥饿，所以走到厨房去，切下几片面包，涂上了牛油。她分一些给托托吃。她从架子上拿下一只木桶，到小河里去汲满了清得发亮的水。托托跑到树林里去，向那些蹲在树上的鸟儿们吠着。多萝茜跑过去捉托托，却看见了美好的果子，挂在枝头上，她摘下了一些，正好当作早餐。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I wonder if they will fit me," she said to Toto. "They would be just the thing to take a long walk in, for they could not wear out." She took off her old leather shoes and tried on the silver ones, which fitted her as well as if they had been made for her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她对托托说：“我要知道，如果它们适合我穿的话，我要走长路正是用得着，因为这种鞋子不容易穿破。”于是她脱下旧皮鞋，穿上那双银的，不大不小好像是为了她做的一般。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"They surely will never do for a long journey, Toto," she said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她说：“托托，旧鞋子一定不能够走长路的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There were several roads near by, but it did not take her long to find the one paved with yellow bricks. Within a short time she was walking briskly toward the Emerald City, her silver shoes tinkling merrily on the hard, yellow road-bed. The sun shone bright and the birds sang sweetly, and Dorothy did not feel nearly so bad as you might think a little girl would who had been suddenly whisked away from her own country and set down in the midst of a strange land.</div>

<div class="line_en">Toward evening, when Dorothy was tired with her long walk and began to wonder where she should pass the night, she came to a house rather larger than the rest. On the green lawn before it many men and women were dancing. Five little fiddlers played as loudly as possible, and the people were laughing and singing, while a big table near by was loaded with delicious fruits and nuts, pies and cakes, and many other good things to eat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="将近黄昏了，多萝茜走了长长的路，已经疲倦了，才急于要知道她应当在什么地方过夜，她跑到一所比其余的大一点儿的屋子。在前面的绿草地上，有许多男人和女人在跳舞。五个小提琴手，尽力地拉得响，大家笑着，唱着。这时，近旁边的一张大桌子上，摆着精美的果子和硬壳果，包子和糕饼，还有其他好多好吃的东西。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The houses of the Munchkins were odd-looking dwellings, for each was round, with a big dome for a roof. All were painted blue, for in this country of the East blue was the favorite color.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="芒奇金人的屋子，都是样式奇怪的建筑物，每一幢是圆的，盖着一个大的圆屋顶，完全漆着蓝色，因为在这东方的国度里，蓝色是大家喜爱的 色彩。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She was surprised, as she walked along, to see how pretty the country was about her. There were neat fences at the sides of the road, painted a dainty blue color, and beyond them were fields of grain and vegetables in abundance. Evidently the Munchkins were good farmers and able to raise large crops. Once in a while she would pass a house, and the people came out to look at her and bow low as she went by; for everyone knew she had been the means of destroying the Wicked Witch and setting them free from bondage.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当她向前走过去时，她很惊奇地看见四周都是十分美丽的地方。路旁边有整齐的短墙，漆着文雅的蓝色，隔墙满是谷类和蔬菜的田地。很明显，芒奇金人都是好农民，能够得到丰收。有时候，她经过一所屋子，大家跑出来看她，当她走过去时，他们低低地向她鞠着躬，因为每一个人都知道她就是杀死恶女巫的那个人，她把他们从奴隶中解放出来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I do not know," answered Boq gravely, "for I have never been there. It is better for people to keep away from Oz, unless they have business with him. But it is a long way to the Emerald City, and it will take you many days. The country here is rich and pleasant, but you must pass through rough and dangerous places before you reach the end of your journey."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我可不知道，”波奎庄重地回答说，“因为我从来没有到过那里。除非大家有什么事务和来往，还是不到奥芝的地方去好。你到翡翠城去的路程是长长的，要花费许多日子。在我们这个地方是富有的，并且快乐的，但是在你到达旅程的目的地以前，你必得经过不平坦和危险的地方。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She ate a hearty breakfast, and watched a wee Munchkin baby, who played with Toto and pulled his tail and crowed and laughed in a way that greatly amused Dorothy. Toto was a fine curiosity to all the people, for they had never seen a dog before.</div>

<div class="line_en">She bade her friends good-bye, and again started along the road of yellow brick. When she had gone several miles she thought she would stop to rest, and so climbed to the top of the fence beside the road and sat down. There was a great cornfield beyond the fence, and not far away she saw a Scarecrow, placed high on a pole to keep the birds from the ripe corn.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她向她的朋友们说着再会，沿着黄砖铺砌的路又动身了。她赶了好儿里路，想停下来休息，就爬到路旁边短墙的顶上坐下来。隔墙是一大块稻田，离开得不远处，她看见有一个稻草人，高挂在竹竿上，看管着鸦雀，不让它们飞近长得成熟的稻子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">An old, pointed blue hat, that had belonged to some Munchkin, was perched on his head, and the rest of the figure was a blue suit of clothes, worn and faded, which had also been stuffed with straw.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="戴在头上的是一顶像芒奇金人样 式的破旧的、蓝色的尖顶帽子，身上穿的是一件蓝色的衣服，已经褪了色了，身体里面也是塞满了稻草。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">While Dorothy was looking earnestly into the queer, painted face of the Scarecrow, she was surprised to see one of the eyes slowly wink at her. She thought she must have been mistaken at first, for none of the scarecrows in Kansas ever wink; but presently the figure nodded its head to her in a friendly way. Then she climbed down from the fence and walked up to it, while Toto ran around the pole and barked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="正当多萝茜认真地注视那稻草人的脸儿上画着奇特的色彩时，她吃惊地看见他一只眼睛徐徐地向她眨着。起初，她想她一定弄错了，因为在堪萨斯州的稻草人，没有一个是眨眼的。但是现在这个家伙，却又在友好地向她点点头。于是她从短墙上爬下来，走到他那里去，这时候托托在竹竿的四周跑着，吠着。">查看中文翻译</div>
