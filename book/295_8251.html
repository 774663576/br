<div class="line_en">Theresa spent the rest of the afternoon exploring while Garrett worked in the shop. Because she didn't know Wilmington well, she asked for directions to the historic district and spent a few hours looking through the stores. Most of them catered to tourists, and she found a few things that Kevin would like, though nothing that suited her tastes. After buying him a couple of pairs of shorts he could wear once he got back from California, she went back to the hotel to catch a quick nap. The last couple of days had taken their toll, and she fell asleep quickly.</div>

<div class="line_en">Garrett, on the other hand, faced one small crisis after another. A shipment of new equipment arrived just after he got back, and after packing up what he didn't need, he called the company to make arrangements to send back the rest. Later in the afternoon he found out that three people who had been scheduled for dive classes this weekend would be out of town and had to cancel. A quick check of the waiting list proved fruitless.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="而盖瑞特那边，许多问题接踵而来。他刚回来就有一船新设备到了，他先将不需要的东西打包起来，然后给公司打了个电话，让对方安排将剩下的送回去。那天下午，他还发现三个已经安排好这周末来学习潜水的学员也许会出城，不得不取消。他迅速地检查了一番等候名单，但无果。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">By six-thirty he was tired, and he breathed a sigh of relief when he finally closed up for the night. After work he drove first to the grocery store and picked up the items he needed for dinner. He showered and put on a pair of clean jeans and a light cotton shirt, then went to the refrigerator to get a beer. After opening it, he stepped out onto the back deck and sat in one of the wrought-iron chairs. Checking his watch, he realized that Theresa would be here soon.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到了六点半，他已经筋疲力尽了，当商店终于打烊时，他如释重负地叹了口气。下班后他先开车去了杂货店，买了晚餐需要的东西。然后他冲了个澡，穿上了一条干净的牛仔裤，和一件轻柔的棉布衬衣，最后走到冰箱边拿出一瓶啤酒。打开后，他出门走到房屋后甲板上，坐在一个锻铁椅子上。看看表，他意识到特丽莎很快就要到了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It was busy. Customers kept coming in until we closed, and I had a load of paperwork I had to get through. In fact, I just got home a little while ago." He started toward the front door, Theresa right beside him. "How about you? What did you end up doing the rest of the day?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“忙得昏天暗地。一直到关门闭客，有一大堆工作要处理。实际上，我才刚到家没多久。”他朝前门走去，特丽莎和他并肩而行。“你呢？今天余下时间都干了什么？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He walked toward her as casually as he could, and Theresa met him halfway, carrying a bottle of white wine. When he got close to her, he smelled the scent of perfume, something she hadn't worn before.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他尽量随意地朝她走去，特丽莎拿着一瓶白葡萄酒，在半路和他碰上。他走近时，闻到了香水味，她之前都没有抹香水。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She stepped out wearing jeans and the same blouse she had worn earlier, the one that did wonderful things for her figure. She looked relaxed as she walked toward him, and when she smiled warmly at him, he realized that his attraction had grown stronger since their lunch this afternoon, and it made him a little uneasy for a reason he didn't want to admit.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她穿着牛仔裤和今天上午穿的那条完美衬托出她身型的衬衣走了出来。当她朝他走来时看上去很放松，他意识到，自从今天他们共进午餐后，她对他的吸引更强烈了，他很不自然，虽然他知道是为什么，但是他不愿意承认。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I brought some wine," she said, handing it to him. "I thought it might go well with dinner." Then, after a short pause: "How was your afternoon?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Garrett was still sitting on the back porch when he finally heard the sound of a slowly idling motor making its way down the block. He stepped off the deck and went around the side of the house, watching as Theresa parked on the street, right behind his truck.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="终于，他听到一辆悠闲的摩托车沿着街区慢慢开来，此时他依然坐在后门廊上。他离开了甲板，从房后转到房前，看着街上，特丽莎停下了车，停在他的卡车后面。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As they approached the door, Theresa looked at the house for the first time. It was relatively small-one story and rectangular shaped-with painted wooden siding that was peeling badly in more than one place. Unlike the homes on Wrightsville Beach, this home sat directly on the sand. When she asked him why it wasn't raised like the other houses, he explained that the house was built before the hurricane building codes went into effect. "Now the houses have to be elevated so that the tidal surge can pass under the main structure. The next big hurricane will probably wash this old house out to sea, but I've been fortunate so far."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当他们走到大门时，特丽莎第一次打量这栋房子。相当小——只有一层，长方形——粉刷过的木覆面材料不止一处严重剥落。不像在赖茨维尔海滩上的那些房子，这栋房子直接建在沙地上。她问他建造时为什么不像其他房子一样将地基升高，他解释说这栋房子是在飓风建筑法规生效之前建造的。“现在的房子都要升高，这样海浪会从他们主建筑下流过。下一次刮起猛烈的飓风，也许就会将这栋旧房子吹到海里去，但是到目前为止我很幸运。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I forgot to ask you earlier, but do you want anything special for dinner?" he asked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“之前我忘了问你，晚餐你想要吃点什么特别的吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Are you kidding? You forget I grew up in Nebraska. I love a good steak."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你说笑的吧？你忘记了我是在内布拉斯加州长大的，我喜欢美味牛排。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'll prove it to you," he said, and she laughed, a melodic sound.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Don't you worry about that?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“难道你不担心吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Not really. There's not much to the place, and that's the only reason I could afford it. I think the former owner finally got tired of all the stress every time a big storm started moving across the Atlantic."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“还真没担心过。这地方没有太多优点，这也是我买得起的唯一原因。我想房子的前主人最终厌倦了每次大风暴移过太平洋时感到的巨大压力。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They reached the cracked front steps and walked inside. The first thing Theresa noticed upon entering was the view from the main room. The windows extended from the floor to the ceiling and ran along the entire back side of the house, overlooking the back deck and Carolina Beach.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们走到裂开的前门台阶，走了进去。一进屋，特丽莎首先注意到的便是主屋的风景。落地窗从地板升到天花板，占住了房子的整个后墙，在房子里可以眺望着后甲板和卡罗来纳海滩。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Off to one side was a fireplace, surrounded by a dozen underwater photographs. She moved toward them. "Do you mind if I look around?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="房子的一边是壁炉，壁炉周围张贴着几张水下照片。她朝照片走去。“我四下瞧瞧你不介意吧？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"This view is incredible," she said, surprised.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这里的景致真是美呆了。”她惊叹道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It is, isn't it? I've been here for a few years now, but I still don't take it for granted."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“很惊人，对吧？我已经在这里住了几年了，但直到现在我依然不能对它等闲视之。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No, go ahead. I have to get the grill out back ready anyway. It needs a bit of cleaning."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不会，随便看。我得去将烤架搬到房子后面去了。需要好好把它清洗一下。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Garrett left through the sliding glass door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="盖瑞特从滑动玻璃门走了出去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After he left, Theresa looked at the pictures for a while, then toured the rest of the house. Like many beach houses she had seen, there wasn't room for more than one or two people to live here. There was only one bedroom, reached by a door off the living room. Like the main room, it also had floor-to-ceiling windows that overlooked the beach. The front portion of the house-the side closest to the street-contained a kitchen, a small dining area (not quite a room), and the bathroom. Though everything was tidy, the house looked as though it hadn't been updated in years.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他离开后，特丽莎看了一会儿照片，然后巡视了下房子其他地方。就像她见过的许多海滨房子一样，这里没有更多房间供两个以上人居住。只有一间卧室，从客厅的一扇门走进去。它像主屋一样也有鸟瞰海滩的落地窗。房子的前部分——靠近街道最近的那边——包括一间厨房，一个小小的用餐区（不能算作一间房）和浴室。尽管东西都很整洁，这栋房子看上去好像好几年都没有翻新过了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Returning to the main room, she stopped at his bedroom and glanced inside. Again she saw underwater photographs decorating the walls. In addition, there was a large map of the North Carolina coast that hung directly over his bed, documenting the location of almost five hundred shipwrecks. When she looked toward his nightstand, she saw a framed picture of a woman. Making sure that Garrett was still outside cleaning the grill, she stepped in to take a closer look.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="回到主屋，她在他卧室前停了下来，朝里望了望。她又看到墙上装饰着水下照片。除此外还有北卡罗来纳州海岸的一幅大地图方方正正挂在他床头，地图上标出了将近五百艘失事船只的方位。当她朝他床头看去时，她看到了一个女人的照片。确定盖瑞特还在外面清洗烤架，她走了进去，想看个仔细。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Catherine must have been in her mid-twenties when it was taken. Like the photos on the walls, it looked as though Garrett had taken it himself, and she wondered whether it had been framed before or after the accident. Picking it up, she saw that Catherine was attractive-a little more petite than she was-with blond hair that hung to midshoulder. Even though the picture was slightly grainy and looked as if it had been reproduced from a smaller photo, she still noticed Catherine's eyes. Deep green and almost catlike, they gave her an exotic look and almost seemed as if they were staring back at her. She put the photo down gently, making sure it was set in the same angle it was before. Turning around, she continued to feel as if Catherine were watching her every move.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="照片中的凯瑟琳肯定是二十五岁左右。就像墙上的其他照片，这张看起来也像是盖瑞特自己照的，她揣摩着不知道照片是事故发生前还是之后才装框的。拿起照片仔细端详，她能看出凯瑟琳非常迷人——比她娇小一点——金黄色的头发垂到了肩膀上。尽管照片有点儿纹路，看起来好像是将一张小点儿的照片放大后重新制作的，但她还是注意到了凯瑟琳的眼睛。深绿色，像是猫眼一样，这双眼睛让她散发出一种异域风情，看上去好像她正在定定地回望着她。她轻轻放下照片，确定放的角度和之前一模一样。转身，她感觉好像凯瑟琳还在注视着她的一举一动。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ignoring the sensation, she looked at the mirror attached to his chest of drawers. Surprisingly, there was only one more photo that included Catherine. It was a picture of Garrett and Catherine smiling broadly, standing on the deck of Happenstance. Because the boat looked as if it had already been restored, she assumed the picture must have been taken only a few months before she died.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="撇开那种异样的感觉，她朝挂在衣柜上的镜子里望去。吃惊地发现，卧室中还有另一张照片中还有凯瑟琳。在这张照片里，盖瑞特和凯瑟琳站在“意外号”的甲板上，笑得很灿烂。因为照片上的船看起来好像已经修理过了，她猜这张照片是在她死之前几个月拍下的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Did you take all the photos on the walls?" she asked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“墙上的照片都是你自己拍的吗？”她问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Knowing he could enter the house at any time, she left his bedroom, feeling a little guilty about poking around in the first place. She walked to the sliding glass doors that led from the main room onto the deck and opened them. Garrett was cleaning the grill top and smiled at her when he heard her come out. She strolled to the edge of the deck where he was working and leaned against one of the rails, one leg over the other.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她知道盖瑞特随时都可能走进房子，于是离开了他的卧室，不免为自己到处窥视感到些许自责。她走向连着主屋和后甲板的滑动玻璃门，推开了。盖瑞特正在清理烤架的上端，听到她走出来转头冲她笑了笑。他在甲板的边沿忙活着，她走过去，靠在一根栏杆上，一条腿翘起，放在另一条腿上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He used the back of his hand to wipe the hair from his face. "Yeah. For a while there, I took my camera out on most of my dives. I hung most of them at the shop, but because I had so many, I thought I'd put some up here as well."</div>

<div class="line_en">As he spoke, Garrett held up the grill top. Although it was charred black in places, it looked ready, and he set it off to one side. He reached for a bag of charcoal and dumped some into a grill that looked thirty years old, using his hand to make sure they were spread evenly. Then he added a bit of lighter fluid, soaking each briquette for just a moment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他一边说一边拿起烤架的顶部。尽管烤架有些部位烧焦了，但看上去却很好用。他将它放在一边，伸手去拿一袋木炭，往烤架里倒了一些，那烤架看起来像是用了三十年一样，他用手将木炭抚平，以确保木炭分布均匀。然后他加了一点儿火机油，让每个煤球浸泡片刻。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">While he was gone, Theresa turned and looked up and down the beach.

<div class="line_en">Theresa stood off to one side as Garrett put the last of the potatoes in the oven and got the salad out of the refrigerator. From the corner of his eye, he glanced at her as he emptied the salad into a bowl. What was it about her that made him suddenly want to be as close to her as possible?

Theresa was relaxing against the counter, and when she took the bottle, something about the way she was standing struck him as familiar: the smile playing across her lips, maybe, or the slant of her gaze as she watched him lift his own bottle to his mouth. He was reminded again of that lazy summer afternoon with Catherine, when he'd come home to surprise her for lunch-a day that in retrospect seemed so fraught with signs... yet how could he have foreseen everything that would happen? They had stood in the kitchen, just as he and Theresa were doing now.</div>

Once he reached the grill, he checked the coals, putting his mind to the task at hand. Almost white, they had another few minutes, he figured. Again he went to the sea chest, and this time he removed a small, handheld bellows. He set it on the railing next to the grill and took a deep breath. The ocean air was fresh, almost intoxicating, and for the first time, he suddenly realized that despite his vision of Catherine just moments ago, he was still pleased that Theresa was here.

<div class="line_en">Garrett's mind drifted through the last two days. He thought about the moment he'd first seen her, the hours they'd spent on Happenstance, and their walk on the beach earlier in the day when he'd first told her about Catherine. The tension he'd felt earlier in the day was almost gone now, and as they stood beside each other in the deepening twilight, he sensed that there was something more to this evening than either of them wanted to admit.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="盖瑞特的心思飘回过去的这两天。他想起他第一眼看到她的那一刻、他们在“意外号”上共度的时光，还有今天早些时候他们在海滩上散步时的情景，也就是在那时他第一次跟她讲凯瑟琳。他今天早些时候感到的紧张现在几乎都消失了，当他们并肩站在渐深的暮色中，他感觉到今晚有些异样，这是他们俩都不愿承认的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For the next few minutes, the only sounds around them came from elsewhere. Garrett turned the steaks, and they sizzled on the grill. The gentle evening breeze made a distant wind chime sing. Waves rolled up on the shore, a soothing, continuous roar.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接下来的几分钟，他们都默默无言，只有远处传来些许声音。盖瑞特翻动着牛排，它们在烤架上发出咝咝声。温柔的晚风在远处齐声合唱。浪涛卷到岸上，不断发出令人舒心的奏鸣。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Just before the steaks were ready, Theresa went back inside to get the rest of the table ready. She pulled the potatoes out of the oven, unwrapped the foil, and placed one on each plate. The salad came next, and she set it in the middle of the table, along with a couple of different dressings she had found in the refrigerator door. Last, she put down salt, pepper, butter, and a couple of napkins. Because it was getting dark inside the house, she turned on the kitchen light, but that seemed too bright. She switched it off again. On impulse, she went ahead and lit the candles, standing back from the table to see if it was too much. Thinking it looked about right, she picked up the bottle of wine and was placing it on the table just as Garrett came inside.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="牛排即将要烤好的时候，特丽莎返回屋中去将桌子上的其他东西摆好。她将土豆从烤箱中拉出来，剥开锡箔纸，在两个盘子里各放了一个。接下来是沙拉，她将它放在桌子中央，她将冰箱门上找到的几种不同的沙拉调料和沙拉放在一起。最后，她放下盐、胡椒粉、黄油和两片餐巾纸。因为屋内光线渐暗，她打开了厨房的灯，但是灯光似乎太亮了。她又关掉了。冲动之下，她点亮了蜡烛，她从餐桌边往后退，看是否太过分了。她想效果还不错，拿起白葡萄酒瓶，将它放在餐桌上。就在这时盖瑞特走了进来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="躺在他身旁，她的手又攀上他的胸，掌心因他胸前的汗水而濡湿了，她感觉到他的手缓缓游移到她的牛仔裤边，解开了裤子的纽扣，微托起她的臀部，她脱下了裤子，先是一条腿，然后是另一个条腿。他的手继续在她的身上探索，她的双手爱抚着他的背，轻柔地啃咬着他的脖子，他的心跳逐渐加快。她低头褪下自己的内裤时，他也快速脱下自己的。终于，他们赤裸相呈，随即身体紧紧地贴在一起。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She was beautiful in the candlelight. He ran his tongue between her breasts, down her belly, and past her navel and up again. Her hair caught the light, making it sparkle, and her skin was soft and inviting as they clung to each other. He felt her hands on his back, pulling him closer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在烛光下，她的裸体看上去很美，他的舌尖在她乳沟里游走，一路往下舔至小腹，舌尖掠过她的肚脐，又往上吻去。烛光投射在她的头发上，闪耀着珍珠般的光泽，她的肌肤是如此的柔软细嫩，仿佛在邀请他去品尝，他们更紧地拥抱彼此。他感受到她手抚在他背部的急切，想把他更近地揉进她。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Their bodies moved as one, each of them fully aware of the other's needs, each trying to please the other. Garrett kissed her almost continually, the moistness of his mouth lingering wherever it touched, and she felt her body began to tingle with the growing urgency of something wonderful. When it finally happened, she pressed her fingers hard into his back, but the moment it ended another one started to build again and she began to climax in long sequences, one right after the next. When they finished making love, Theresa was exhausted, and she wrapped her arms around him, holding him close. She relaxed by his side, his hands still gently tracing her skin, and she watched as the candles slowly burned toward their base, reliving the moment they had just shared together.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们的身体一起律动着，两人都能完全感受到对方的需要，努力地取悦对方。盖瑞特的吻始终没有间断过，嘴里呼出的热情徜徉在他触碰的每个地方，她感觉到自己的身体逐渐剧烈地渴求着某种极致的快感。当高潮终于来临的时候，她的手指深深地掐进了他的背部，一波刚刚停息，另一波的快感又急剧袭来，高潮迭起，她仿佛被抛上了一波波的高潮顶端，不停息地浮浮沉沉。终于结束了，特丽莎全身仿佛散架了一般，酸痛疲累不堪，她用双臂环着他，紧紧地抱着。她躺在他的身侧放松休息，他的手仍然来回抚摩着她的肌肤。柔和的烛光慢慢烧到底部，她静静地凝视着，回味着刚刚他们分享彼此的时刻。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She pulled him back to her, arching her back as he slowly moved atop her. He kissed her fingertips one at a time, and as they finally joined as one, she closed her eyes with a sigh. Kissing softly, they made love with a passion kept stifled for the last three years.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她把他拉向自己，弓起了自己的身体，他缓缓地覆盖在她身上，一根一根地舔吻着她的手指，终于他们结合为了一体。特丽莎闭上眼睛，满足地发出一声喟叹。他们轻柔地吻着彼此，三年来一直压抑的欲望和热情在他们结合的那一刻彻底迸发了出来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Instead he continued to kiss her body, not rushing the moment. He put the side of his face to her belly and rubbed gently. The stubble on his chin felt erotic against her skin, and she lay back on the bed, her hands in his hair. He went on until she couldn't take it anymore, then he moved up and did the same thing to her breasts.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他仍然细细密密地吻着她的身体，不急于一时。他把脸颊贴在她的小腹上，轻柔地摩擦着，他下巴上的胡茬略带情色地扎痛了她的肌肤，她禁不住颤抖起来，她在床上躺下，双手插入他的头发。直到她再也忍受不了了他才停手，重新吻上了她的双乳。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Right before daybreak, Theresa opened her eyes, realizing instinctively that he was gone. She turned in the bed, looking for him. Not seeing him, she rose and went to his closet, finding a bathrobe. Wrapping it around her, she left the bedroom and glanced toward the darkness of the kitchen. Not there. She looked in the living room, but he wasn't there, either, and suddenly she knew exactly where he would be.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="黎明破晓时，特丽莎睁开了双眼，本能地意识到他不在床上，翻了个身，她四下搜寻他的身影。但并没有找到，于是她起身走到衣柜前找出一件睡袍。她套上了睡袍，走出卧室，探头看了看黑漆漆的厨房，他也不在那里。扫视了一遍起居室，仍然没有看到他的身影。突然，一个念头闪过，她想她知道他在哪里了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They lay together for most of the night, making love again and again, holding each other tightly afterward. Theresa fell asleep in his arms, feeling wonderful, and Garrett watched as she slept beside him. Just before he fell asleep, he gently brushed her hair from her face, trying hard to remember everything.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们夜里大部分时间都躺在一起，一遍一遍地做爱，然后紧紧相拥。特丽莎在他的怀中舒适地睡着了，盖瑞特凝视着躺在身边的她。即将入睡时，他轻轻地把她的头发从脸上拂开，努力地回忆着整晚的一切。">查看中文翻译</div>
