<div class="line_en">Once upon a time there was a young fellow who enlisted as a soldier, conducted himself bravely, and was always at the very front when it was raining bullets. As long as the war lasted all went well, but when peace was made he was dismissed, and the captain said he could go wherever he wanted to.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the fourth year he arrived an inn. The innkeeper would not let him enter, refusing even to let him have a place in the stable because he was afraid he would frighten the horses. However, when Bearskin reached into his pocket and pulled out a handful of ducats, the innkeeper softened and gave him a room in an outbuilding. Bearskin, however, had to promise not to let himself be seen, lest the inn should get a bad name.</div>

<div class="line_en">During the first year his appearance was still acceptable, but during the second he looked like a monster. His hair covered nearly his entire face. His beard looked like a piece of coarse felt cloth. His fingers had claws, and his face was so covered with dirt that if someone had planted cress on it, it would have grown. Everyone who saw him ran away. However, because everywhere he went he gave money to the poor to pray that he might not die during the seven years, and because he paid well for everything, he always found shelter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第一年他的相貌尚可说得过去，可是第二年他看起来就像个魔鬼了。他的长发遮面，鬍鬚像一块粗糙的毛毡，手指像兽爪，满脸是厚厚的污垢，彷彿播上芹菜种都能长出来似的。人们一看见他都给吓跑了，他每到一处都赏给别人钱，让人们为自己祈祷别在七年中死去，由於他作任何事都慷慨大方，所以他总是能找到住宿的地方。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One evening Bearskin was sitting alone, wishing with all his heart that the seven years were over, he heard a loud moaning in a neighboring room. He had a compassionate heart, so he opened the door and saw an old man weeping bitterly and striking his hands together above his head. Bearskin went nearer, but the man jumped to his feet and tried to run away. At last, hearing a human voice, the man let Bearskin talk to him, and with friendly words Bearskin succeeded in getting the old man to reveal the cause of his grief. Slowly but surely the old man had lost his wealth, and now he and his daughters would have to starve. He was so poor that he could not pay the innkeeper and was to be sent to prison.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="傍晚，熊皮人孤伶伶地一个人坐在屋子里，从心底里希望七年已经熬到头。就在这时，他听见从隔壁的屋子里传出一阵悲切的哭声。他怀着一颗同情的心打开了门，看见一位老人双手绞在一起，痛苦地哭泣着。熊皮人走上前去，然而老人跳起来，挣扎着从他身边逃开了。最后老人听出熊皮人说的是人话，方才放下心来，在熊皮人长时间善言善语的劝说下，老人才透露了他悲伤的原因。原来在漫长的生活中，他破产了，他和他的女儿们在挨饿，现在已身无分文，再没有办法付住店的钱，快要被送进监狱了。">查看中文翻译</div>
