Chris Holmes made sure to school his daughter not just in the outsized success of its older generations but also in the failings of its younger ones. Both his father and grandfather had lived large but flawed lives, cycling through marriages and struggling with alcoholism. Chris blamed them for squandering the family fortune.</div>

<div class="line_en">Bettie Fleischmann, Charles's daughter, married her father's Danish physician, Dr. Christian Holmes. He was Elizabeth's great-great-grandfather. Aided by the political and business connections of his wife's wealthy family, Dr. Holmes established Cincinnati General Hospital and the University of Cincinnati's medical school.

<div class="line_en">The cousins slept on foam mattresses on the condo's floor and dashed off to the beach in the mornings for a swim. The afternoons were whiled away playing Monopoly. When Elizabeth was ahead, which was most of the time, she would insist on playing on to the bitter end, piling on the houses and hotels for as long as it took for David and Christian to go broke. When she occasionally lost, she stormed off in a fury and, more than once, ran right through the screen of the condo's front door. It was an early glimpse of her intense competitive streak.</div>

<div class="line_en">During her sophomore year, she threw herself into her schoolwork, often staying up late at night to study, and became a straight-A student. It was the start of a lifelong pattern: work hard and sleep little. As she excelled academically, she also managed to find her footing socially and dated the son of a respected Houston orthopedic surgeon. They traveled to New York together to celebrate the new millennium in Times Square.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="高二那一年，她开始埋首功课，常常熬夜念书，摇身一变成为每科都拿A的学生。更从此养成终身的生活型态：工作努力、睡眠很少。除了学业过人，她的社交生活也找到立足点，还跟休士顿受人尊敬的整形外科医师之子交往，两人结伴到纽约旅行，在时代广场庆祝新的千禧年到来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In high school, Elizabeth wasn't part of the popular crowd. By then, her father had moved the family to Houston to take a job at the conglomerate Tenneco. The Holmes children attended St. John's, Houston's most prestigious private school. A gangly teenage girl with big blue eyes, Elizabeth bleached her hair in an attempt to fit in and struggled with an eating disorder.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="上了高中，伊莉莎白并不是受欢迎的学生。当时父亲转任天纳克公司（Tenneco，编按：全球汽车排气系统和零件制造龙头），全家搬到德州休士顿，两个小孩就读休士顿最有名望的私立学校圣约翰（St. John's）。十几岁的伊莉莎白身材高瘦，还有双大大的蓝色眼睛，为了融入环境，她把头发漂成浅色，并且为了饮食失调所苦。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As college drew closer, Elizabeth set her sights on Stanford. It was the obvious choice for an accomplished student interested in science and computers who dreamed of becoming an entrepreneur. The little agricultural college founded by railroad tycoon Leland Stanford at the end of the nineteenth century had become inextricably linked with Silicon Valley.</div>

<div class="line_en">Elizabeth already knew Stanford well. Her family had lived in Woodside, California, a few miles from the Stanford campus, for several years in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

Jesse's father was Tim Draper, a third-generation venture capitalist who was on his way to becoming one of the Valley's most successful startup investors.</div>

<div class="line_en">Elizabeth had another connection to Stanford: Chinese. Her father had traveled to China a lot for work and decided his children should learn Mandarin, so he and Noel had arranged for a tutor to come to the house in Houston on Saturday mornings. Midway through high school, Elizabeth talked her way into Stanford's summer Mandarin program. It was only supposed to be open to college students, but she impressed the program's director enough with her fluency that he made an exception. The first five weeks were taught on the Stanford campus in Palo Alto, followed by four weeks of instruction in Beijing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="而伊莉莎白跟斯坦福还有一个渊源：中文。她的父亲因为工作之故常常往返中国，因而决定小孩必须学中文，于是和太太安排家教，每周六早上到休士顿家中教中文。高中念到一半，伊莉莎白就进入斯坦福暑期中文班。该课程原本只接受大学生申请，但是她以流利的中文惊艳主事者，破格录取。课程前五周在斯坦福位于帕罗奥图（Palo Alto）的校园授课，接下来四周则移师北京上课。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The face of Stanford's chemical engineering department was Channing Robertson. Charismatic, handsome, and funny, Robertson had been teaching at the university since 1970 and had a rare ability to connect with his students. He was also by far the hippest member of the engineering faculty, sporting a graying blond mane and showing up to class in leather jackets that made him seem a decade younger than his fifty-nine years.</div>

<div class="line_en">Her father had drilled into her the notion that she should live a purposeful life. During his career in public service, Chris Holmes had overseen humanitarian efforts like the 1980 Mariel boatlift, in which more than one hundred thousand Cubans and Haitians migrated to the United States. There were pictures around the house of him providing disaster relief in war-torn countries. The message Elizabeth took away from them is that if she wanted to truly leave her mark on the world, she would need to accomplish something that furthered the greater good, not just become rich. Biotechnology offered the prospect of achieving both. She chose to study chemical engineering, a field that provided a natural gateway to the industry.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="父亲一向灌输她一个观念：人生要有明确的方向。担任公职期间，克利斯勤．霍姆斯督导过多次人道救援，像是一九八〇年马列尔事件（Mariel boatlift，编按：二十世纪最大规模的移民事件之一），当时有十几万古巴人和海地人移居美国。家里挂满他在饱受战乱国家提供援助的照片，伊莉莎白从中学到，如果想真正对世界产生影响，光变成有钱人是不够的，而是要做到为众生谋利。生物科技（biotechnology）有机会让她两者兼得，于是她选择主修化学工程，这是进入生技产业的入门砖。">查看中文翻译</div>

While its address was technically in Menlo Park, it was in a gritty industrial zone on the edge of East Palo Alto, where shootings remained frequent. One morning, Elizabeth showed up at work with shards of glass in her hair. Someone had shot at her car and shattered the driver's-side window, missing her head by inches.</div>

<div class="line_en">Another family connection she tapped for a large investment, the retired corporate turnaround specialist Victor Palmieri, was a longtime friend of her father's. The two had met in the late 1970s during the Carter administration when Chris Holmes worked at the State Department and Palmieri served as its ambassador at large for refugee affairs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她利用家族人脉取得的另一笔大资金，是来自父亲的老友：已退休、擅长将企业转亏为盈的维多．帕米尔利（Victor Palmieri）。父亲和帕米尔利结识于一九七〇年代末卡特政府（Carter administration）时期，当时父亲服务于国务院，帕米尔利是无任所大使（编按：代表国家的高级外交官，没有固定驻所），主管难民事务。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Elizabeth impressed Draper and Palmieri with her bubbly energy and her vision of applying principles of nano- and microtechnology to the field of diagnostics. In a twenty-six-page document she used to recruit investors, she described an adhesive patch that would draw blood painlessly through the skin using microneedles. The TheraPatch, as the document called it, would contain a microchip sensing system that would analyze the blood and make "a process control decision" about how much of a drug to deliver. It would also communicate its readings wirelessly to a patient's doctor. The document included a colored diagram of the patch and its various components.</div>

<div class="line_en">To raise the money she needed, she leveraged her family connections. She convinced Tim Draper, the father of her childhood friend and former neighbor Jesse Draper, to invest $1 million. The Draper name carried a lot of weight and helped give Elizabeth some credibility: Tim's grandfather had founded Silicon Valley's first venture capital firm in the late 1950s, and Tim's own firm, DFJ, was known for lucrative early investments in companies like the web-based email service Hotmail.</div>

<div class="line_en">Not everyone bought the pitch. One morning in July 2004, Elizabeth met with MedVenture Associates, a venture capital firm that specialized in medical technology investments. Sitting across a conference room table from the firm's five partners, she spoke quickly and in grand terms about the potential her technology had to change mankind.</div>

Feinberg, a real estate and private equity investor who was on the board of Houston's MD Anderson Cancer Center. She also persuaded a fellow Stanford student named Michael Chang, whose family controlled a multibillion-dollar distributor of high-tech devices in Taiwan, to invest.

<div class="line_en">As the money flowed in, it became apparent to Shaunak that a little patch that could do all the things Elizabeth wanted it to do bordered on science fiction. It might be theoretically possible, just like manned flights to Mars were theoretically possible. But the devil was in the details. In an attempt to make the patch concept more feasible, they pared it down to just the diagnostic part, but even that was incredibly challenging.</div>

<div class="line_en">Eventually they jettisoned the patch altogether in favor of something akin to the handheld devices used to monitor blood-glucose levels in diabetes patients. Elizabeth wanted the Theranos device to be portable like those glucose monitors, but she wanted it to measure many more substances in the blood than just sugar, which would make it a lot more complex and therefore bulkier.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="资金不断涌入，萧内克心里很明白，一个小小的贴片要做到伊莉莎白想要的所有功能，无异于科幻小说。理论上或许可行，就像载人上火星理论上也是可能的，但是魔鬼藏在细节里。为了让贴片的概念更加可行，他们把贴片的功能缩减到只剩诊断，但就算如此仍是困难重重。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The compromise was a cartridge-and-reader system that blended the fields of microfluidics and biochemistry. The patient would prick her finger to draw a small sample of blood and place it in a cartridge that looked like a thick credit card. The cartridge would slot into a bigger machine called a reader. Pumps inside the reader would push the blood through tiny channels in the cartridge and into little wells coated with proteins known as antibodies. On its way to the wells, a filter would separate the blood's solid elements, its red and white blood cells, from the plasma and let only the plasma through. When the plasma came into contact with the antibodies, a chemical reaction would produce a signal that would be "read" by the reader and translated into a result.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后他们完全舍弃贴片，改采类似于糖尿病患监测血糖所用的手持设备，伊莉莎白希望像血糖机一样方便携带，但又希望不只能监测血糖，还能检测血液中多种物质。如此一来就会变得更复杂，体积也会更大。折衷结果是利用「卡匣搭配读卡机」，结合微流控技术（microfluidics）和生物化学（biochemistry）。患者自己扎手指抽取少量血液样本，然后将血液置入一个很像厚信用卡的卡匣，再把卡匣插入一台称为读卡机的较大机器。读卡机里的帮浦会把卡匣里的血液从很小的信道挤压出来，流入涂有一层蛋白质（也就是所谓的抗体）的小井，流向小井途中会有过滤器将血液中的固态成分（也就是红血球和白血球）和血浆分离，只让血浆通过小井，血浆接触到抗体会产生化学反应，释放出信号，读卡机会「读取」信号后，转译为结果。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">By late 2005, eighteen months after he'd come on board, Shaunak was beginning to feel like they were making progress. The company had a prototype, dubbed the Theranos 1.0, and had grown to two dozen employees.

<div class="line_en">Elizabeth envisioned placing the cartridges and readers in patients' homes so that they could test their blood regularly. A cellular antenna on the reader would send the test results to the computer of a patient's doctor by way of a central server. This would allow the doctor to make adjustments to the patient's medication quickly, rather than waiting for the patient to go get his blood tested at a blood-draw center or during his next office visit.</div>
