<div class="line_en">Coming out of the bathroom, she turned and looked at her wrinkled face in the mirror and gasped a tired answer to her long asked question, "never, you just keep driving in the sunset."She shook her head to wing away those vicious butterflies in her mind. She knew she couldn't join them so she didn't want them to hang around her either.</div>

<div class="line_en">Tanya got out of the bed while the sun was still asleep. "Would I be able to watch sunrise today?" She asked her heart. She knew the answer but was afraid to tell herself. Mike, her husband, was still in bed and so were her four kids. Even their sleep couldn't prevent her from doing them service. She arranged her work to the microscopic details. From pressing clothes to polishing shoes, finding sports socks to putting school bags in order, fixing up breakfast to preparing snack-boxes, she wanted to make it all happen like magic, She did it all, like a magician.</div>

<div class="line_en">Life ran like a wheel. The circle started every morning and ended up late in the night, and then morning appeared again.

<div class="line_en">She never got to know when morning ran into noon: even the clock failed to tell her that. Mike left for office still screaming and shouting for his towel and the school bus only arrived after the kids had swallowed their breakfast. Their absence couldn't cease her work for there was too much work to do. She was planning to send dirty clothes to laundry when the doorbell rang. It had been so long nobody coming to their home that she had forgotten what their doorbell sounded like. She tried to guess who could it be but not a single name appeared in her mind. She opened the door with an uncertain hope but only found the postman standing in the door to vanish that uncertainty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她从来不知道早晨什么时候到了中午，就连钟也没有告诉她。迈克离开办公室时仍然尖叫着要他的毛巾，校车在孩子们吞下早餐后才到达。他们的缺席不能停止她的工作，因为有太多的工作要做。她正打算把脏衣服送到洗衣店去，这时门铃响了。已经很久没有人来他们家了，她都忘了他们家的门铃是怎么响的了。她试图猜测那是谁，但脑子里一个名字也没有出现。她带着一种不确定的希望打开了门，但只是发现邮递员站在门口，让那种不确定消失了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She entered the kitchen and heard Mike yelling in his uneasy voice for the absence of his towel in the bathroom. Her youngest daughter Karen started crying that she didn't want to go to school that day. Nicole, the eldest, couldn't help herself but to blame Daniel for the overnight fragmentation of her dollhouse while Randal registered his protest from his bed that he was not going lo drink milk in breakfast like every day. In the kitchen, sugar had run out. So she was still looking for that magic wand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她走进厨房，听到迈克因为浴室里没有毛巾而不安地大喊大叫。她最小的女儿凯伦哭着说她那天不想去学校。大女儿妮可忍不住责怪丹尼尔一夜之间把她的玩具屋弄得支离破碎，而兰德尔则在床上表示抗议，说他不会像往常一样在早餐时喝牛奶。在厨房里，糖已经用完了。所以她还在寻找那根魔杖。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The time from Sunday morning to evening was hard to spend. Time clock was snailing Out of the day and the sun got hung up in mid air. Wind stopped on the surface of water and the shadows declined to shrink. She wished time was a horse with a tail on the forehead and she would pull it from its tail. She wished time was a dry leaf and she would blow it in the windstorm of her heart. She wished time was a boat and she would sail it in the river of her eyes. But today, time had turn into a teaser. She wanted the time to fly and it was crawling. She tried to make her self busy in house chores but her eyes quit supporting her hands as they were still looking at the sun. And the sun also kept glaring at her all the day. Finally the sun lost the battle and started going down. From the rim of the roof, it skidded to the window.</div>
