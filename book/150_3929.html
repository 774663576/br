<div class="line_en">Kitty found the work a refreshment to her spirit. She went to the convent every morning soon after sunrise and did not return to the bungalow till the westering sun flooded the narrow river and its crowded junks with gold. The Mother Superior gave into her care the smaller children. Kitty's mother had brought to London from her native Liverpool a practical sense of housewifery and Kitty, notwithstanding her air of frivolity, had always had certain gifts to which she referred only in bantering tones. Thus she could cook quite well and she sewed beautifully. When she disclosed this talent she was set to supervise the stitching and hemming of the younger girls.</div>

<div class="line_en">They knew a little French and every day she picked up a few words of Chinese so that it was not difficult for her to manage. At other times she had to see that the smaller children did not get into mischief; she had to dress and undress them and take care that they rested when rest was needed. There were a good many babies and these were in charge of amahs, but she was bidden to keep an eye on them. None of the work was very important and she would have liked to do something which was more arduous; but the Mother Superior paid no attention to her entreaties and Kitty stood sufficiently in awe of her not to be importunate.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这些女孩稍懂一点法语，她每天都能跟她们学一两句中国话，好让她监管起来也容易一些。其他的时候她还得照看岁数更小的那帮孩子，不单要防着她们淘气打闹，还要给她们穿穿戴戴，该睡觉的时候叫她们睡觉。那群小婴儿虽然有保姆照顾着，但她也被要求时时地去看上一两眼。这些活计都是琐琐碎碎的，她宁愿干点儿费力气的活儿。然而修道院长对她的申诉始终置之不理，凯蒂出于敬畏，没敢死磨硬泡来烦扰院长。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For the first few days she had to make something of an effort to overcome the faint distaste she felt for these little girls, in their ugly uniforms, with their stiff black hair, their round yellow faces, and their staring, sloe-black eyes. But she remembered the soft look which had transfigured so beautifully the countenance of the Mother Superior when on Kitty's first visit to the convent she had stood surrounded by those ugly little things, and she would not allow herself to surrender to her instinct. And presently, taking in her arms one or other of the tiny creatures, crying because of a fall or a cutting tooth, when Kitty found that a few soft words, though in a language the child could not understand, the pressure of her arms and the softness of her cheek against the weeping yellow face, could comfort and console, she began to lose all her feeling of strangeness. The small children, without any fear of her, came to her in their childish troubles and it gave her a peculiar happiness to discern their confidence. It was the same with the older girls, those to whom she taught sewing; their bright, clever smiles, and the pleasure she could give them by a word of praise, touched her. She felt that they liked her and, flattered and proud, she liked them in return.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="起初的几天，她尚需克服对那些小女孩的微微嫌恶感。她们穿着丑陋的统一制服，黑色的头发结成了一团，圆圆的脸呈焦黄色，眼睛显得又黑又大。不过她清晰地记得初次造访修道院时，院长曾被这群难看的小东西团团围住，她当时的面容显得那么温馨慈祥。凯蒂一方面要向院长学习，一方面也不想输给自己骨子里的本能。现在，当这些小小的生命因为摔了一跤或者被别的小孩咬了一口而号啕大哭时，凯蒂会毫不忌讳地把她们抱在怀里，一点也没有异样的感觉。她会柔声地说两句她们听不懂的话，胳膊轻轻地搂住她们，脸颊贴在她们哭着的小黄脸儿上，接着她们就乖乖地不哭了。这些小孩对她早已不认生，遇到什么困难的事儿就会来找凯蒂。看到她们对自己如此信赖，凯蒂的心里异常高兴。那些跟她学裁缝的女孩也给了她同样的感受。她们欢快、聪慧，每当凯蒂说一句夸奖的话，她们就会特别开心，这些都打动着凯蒂。她感到她们喜欢她，令她受宠若惊又骄傲自豪，反过来她也更疼爱她们。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Once, speaking of it to Sister St Joseph, she said that it was a pity it lived. Sister St Joseph smiled and stretched out her hand to the misformed thing. It came and rubbed its bulging forehead against it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有一次，她跟圣约瑟姐妹提起了那个孩子，说她活着真是一件不幸的事。圣约瑟姐妹微笑了起来，朝那个畸形儿摊开手臂。那个小孩跑过来，硕大的脑袋在圣约瑟姐妹的手上厮厮磨磨。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But there was one child that she could not grow used to. It was a little girl of six, an idiot with a huge hydrocephalic head that swayed top-heavily on a small, squat body, large vacant eyes and a drooling mouth; the creature spoke hoarsely a few mumbled words; it was revolting and horrible; and for some reason it conceived an idiot attachment for Kitty so that it followed her about as she changed her place from one part of the large room to another. It clung to her skirt and rubbed its face against her knees. It sought to fondle her hands. She shivered with disgust. She knew it yearned for caresses and she could not bring herself to touch it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是她始终无法驱除对其中一个孩子的嫌恶感。那是一个六岁的小女孩，因为脑积水而变成了白痴。她头大身小，走起路来头重脚轻，摇摇晃晃。她的眼睛空洞无神，嘴角总是淌着口水，口中常常嘟哝着含含糊糊的词儿，声音特别刺耳，让人难受。她令凯蒂觉得厌恶和恐惧，可是不知为什么，她对凯蒂似乎相当依恋，偌大的房间里，凯蒂到了哪儿，她就跟到哪儿。她拽住凯蒂的裙子，把脸贴到凯蒂的膝盖上磨蹭，还伸手想够到凯蒂的手。凯蒂厌恶得全身颤抖，虽然她明白这个孩子是在寻求她的爱抚，但是她无论如何也没有勇气碰她。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Poor little mite," said the nun. "She was brought here positively dying. By the mercy of Providence I was at the door just as she came. I thought there was not a moment to lose so I baptized her at once. You would not believe what trouble we have had to keep her with us. Three or four times we thought that her little soul would escape to heaven."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可怜的孩子，”嬷嬷说道，“她被抱来的时候几乎已经快死了。我主仁慈，送过来那会儿我正好在门口。我觉得事不宜迟，就一刻也没耽搁给她做了洗礼。你根本不会相信我们费了多大的劲儿才把她救活了。有三四回我们都以为她小小的灵魂已经飞去了天堂。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Kitty was silent. Sister St Joseph in her loquacious way began to gossip of other things. And next day when the idiot child came to her and touched her hand Kitty nerved herself to place it in a caress on the great bare skull. She forced her lips into a smile. But suddenly the child, with an idiot perversity, left her; it seemed to lose interest in her, and that day and the following days paid her no attention. Kitty did not know what she had done and tried to lure it to her with smiles and gestures, but it turned away and pretended not to see her.</div>
