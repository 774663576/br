<div class="line_en">The next two days passed without great incident, unless you counted Neville melting his sixth cauldron in Potions. Professor Snape, who seemed to have attained new levels of vindictiveness over the summer, gave Nevihle detention, and Neville returned from it in a state of nervous collapse, having been made to disembowel a barrel full of horned toads.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was common knowledge that Snape really wanted the Dark Arts job, and he had now failed to get it for the fourth year running. Snape had disliked all of their previous Dark Arts teachers, and shown it -- but he seemed strangely wary of displaying overt animosity to Mad-Eye Moody. Indeed, whenever Harry saw the two of them together -- at mealtimes, or when they passed in the corridors -- he had the distinct impression that Snape was avoiding Moody's eye, whether magical or normal.</div>

<div class="line_en">Moody took out a register, shook his long mane of grizzled gray hair out of his twisted and scarred face, and began to call out names, his normal eye moving steadily down the list while his magical eye swiveled around, fixing upon each student as he or she answered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="穆迪拿出花名册，晃了晃脑袋，把花白的长头发从扭曲的、伤痕累累的脸上晃开，开始点名。他那只正常的眼睛顺着名单往下移动，那只带魔法的眼睛不停地转来转去，盯着每一位应答的学生。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was a general murmur of assent.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Right then," he said, when the last person had declared themselves present, "I've had a letter from Professor Lupin about this class.

Ron looked deeply relieved.</div>

<div class="line_en">"You'll be Arthur Weasley's son, eh?" Moody said. "Your father got me out of a very tight corner a few days ago… Yeah, I'm staying just the one year. Special favor to Dumbledore… One year, and then back to my quiet retirement."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你是亚瑟·韦斯莱的儿子吧，嗯？”穆迪说，“几天前，你父亲帮我摆脱了一个很棘手的困难处境…是啊，我只教一年。帮邓布利多一个忙…只教一年，然后重新过我平静的退休生活。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"So -- straight into it. Curses. They come in many strengths and forms. Now, according to the Ministry of Magic, I'm supposed to teach you countercurses and leave it at that. I'm not supposed to show you what illegal Dark curses look like until you're in the sixth year. You're not supposed to be old enough to deal with it till then. But Professor Dumbledore's got a higher opinion of your nerves, he reckons you can cope, and I say, the sooner you know what you're up against, the better. How are you supposed to defend yourself against something you've never seen? A wizard who's about to put an illegal curse on you isn't going to tell you what he's about to do. He's not going to do it nice and polite to your face. You need to be prepared. You need to be alert and watchful. You need to put that away, Miss Brown, when I'm talking."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="穆迪艰难地支着假腿站起来，打开讲台的抽屉，拿出一个玻璃瓶。三只大黑蜘蛛在里面爬个不停。哈利感到罗恩在他身边微微缩了缩身子——罗恩最讨厌蜘蛛了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The spider leapt from Moody's hand on a fine thread of silk and began to swing backward and forward as though on a trapeze. It stretched out its legs rigidly, then did a back flip, breaking the thread and landing on the desk, where it began to cartwheel in circles. Moody jerked his wand, and the spider rose onto two of its hind legs and went into what was unmistakably a tap dance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="蜘蛛从穆迪手掌上跳开了，悬着一根细丝，开始前后荡来荡去，就像坐在高高的秋千上一样。它僵硬地伸直腿，然后回身翻了一个跟头，细丝被拉断了。它摔在桌上，开始绕着圈子翻跟头。穆迪一抖魔杖，它又支着两条后腿站了起来，跳起了一种踢踏舞，没错，就是踢踏舞。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Years back, there were a lot of witches and wizards being controlled by the Imperius Curse," said Moody, and Harry knew he was talking about the days in which Voldemort had been all-powerful.

<div class="line_cn" title="“多年以前，许多巫师都被夺魂咒控制住了，”穆迪说——哈利知道他说的是伏地魔势力最强大的那些日子，“真把魔法部忙坏了。他们要分清谁是被迫行事，谁是按自己的意愿行事。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was a flash of blinding green light and a rushing sound, as though a vast, invisible something was soaring through the air -- instantaneously the spider rolled over onto its back, unmarked, but unmistakably dead. Several of the students stifled cries; Ron had thrown himself backward and almost toppled off his seat as the spider skidded toward him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一道耀眼的绿光刺得人睁不开眼睛，同时还有一阵杂乱的声音，仿佛一个看不见的庞然大物在空中飞过——与此同时，那蜘蛛翻了过来，仰面躺在桌上，身上并无半点伤痕，但无疑已经死了。几个学生使劲忍住想要发出的喊叫；蜘蛛朝罗恩这边滑过来时，罗恩猛地往后一抑，差点儿从座位上摔了下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Moody swept the dead spider off the desk onto the floor.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Not nice," he said calmly. "Not pleasant. And there's no countercurse. There's no blocking it. Only one known person has ever survived it, and he's sitting right in front of me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“很不美好，”他平静地说，“令人不愉快。而且没有限免咒。没有办法抵御它。据人们所知，只有一个人逃脱了这种咒语，他此刻就坐在我的面前。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So that was how his parents had died… exactly like that spider. Had they been unblemished and unmarked too? Had they simply seen the flash of green light and heard the rush of speeding death, before life was wiped from their bodies?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="原来，他父母就是这样死去的…和那只蜘蛛一模一样。他们也是没有一点痕迹，没有一点创伤吗？他们也是看见一道绿光一闪，听见死神匆匆赶来的脚步声，然后生命就从他们的身体里消失了吗？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry felt his face redden as Moody's eyes (both of them) looked into his own. He could feel everyone else looking around at him too. Harry stared at the blank blackboard as though fascinated by it, but not really seeing it at all…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="穆迪的眼睛（两只同时）注视着哈利的眼睛，哈利觉得自己的脸红了。他可以感觉到全班同学都扭过头来望着他。哈利盯着空无一物的黑板，似乎对黑板着了迷，实际上他什么也没有看见…">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry knew these details because he had heard his parents' voices when he had fought the dementors last year -- for that was the terrible power of the dementors: to force their victims to relive the worst memories of their lives, and drown, powerless, in their own despair.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利知道这些细节，因为他去年与摄魂怪搏斗时，曾经听见过父母的声音。摄魂怪具有可怕的魔力，能强迫别人想起一生中最痛苦的往事，陷入绝望的情绪中，瘫软无力，不能自拨…">查看中文翻译</div>

How Voldemort had killed Harry's father first.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Avada Kedavra's a curse that needs a powerful bit of magic behind it -- you could all get your wands out now and point them at me and say the words, and I doubt I'd get so much as a nosebleed. But that doesn't matter. I'm not here to teach you how to do it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“阿瓦达索命咒需要很强大的魔法力量作为基础——你们都可以把魔杖拿出来，对准我，念出这句咒语，我怀疑我最多只会流点鼻血。可是那没有关系。我来就是教你们怎么念咒语的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Now, if there's no countercurse, why am I showing you? Because you've got to know. You've got to appreciate what the worst is. You don't want to find yourself in a situation where you're facing it. CONSTANT VIGILANCE!" he roared, and the whole class jumped again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那么，既然没有解咒，我为什么要向你们展示这些呢？因为你们必须有所了解。你们必须充分意识到什么是最糟糕的。你们不希望发现自己遇到你们现在面对的局面吧。随时保持警惕！”他吼道，又把全班同学吓了一跳。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They spent the rest of the lesson taking notes on each of the Unforgivable Curses. No one spoke until the bell rang -- but when Moody had dismissed them and they had left the classroom, a torrent of talk burst forth. Most people were discussing the curses in awed voices -- "Did you see it twitch? and when he killed it -- just like that!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在这堂课剩下来的时间里，同学们都忙着做笔记，记录这三种不可饶恕咒。教室里静悄悄的，没有人说话，直到下课铃响起——可是当穆迪宣布下课后，同学们刚一离开教室，各种议论顿时像决了口的洪水，汹涌而起。大多数同学都用敬畏的口气谈论着那些咒语——“你看见了蜘蛛抽搐的样子吗？——他一下就把蜘蛛杀死了——就那么简单！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Now… those three curses -- Avada Kedavra, Imperius, and Cruciatus -- are known as the Unforgivable Curses. The use of any one of them on a fellow human being is enough to earn a life sentence in Azkaban. That's what you're up against. That's what I've got to teach you to fight. You need preparing.

<div class="line_en">But an odd clunking noise sounded behind them, and they turned to see Professor Moody limping toward them. All four of them fell silent, watching him apprehensively, but when he spoke, it was in a much lower and gentler growl than they had yet heard.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在这时，他们身后传来一阵噔噔的奇怪声音。他们转过身，看见穆迪教授一瘸一拐地朝这边走来。他们四个顿时都不做声了，有点害怕地注视着他。可是当他开口说话时，他的声音尽管粗哑，却比他们以前听到的低沉柔和得多了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Staring around the room, trying to think of a kind of misfortune he hadn't yet used, Harry saw Fred and George sitting together against the opposite wall, heads together, quills out, poring over a single piece of parchment. It was most unusual to see Fred and George hidden away in a corner and working silently; they usually liked to be in the thick of things and the noisy center of attention. There was something secretive about the way they were working on the piece of parchment, and Harry was reminded of how they had sat together writing something back at the Burrow. He had thought then that it was another order form for Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes, but it didn't look like that this time; if it had been, they would surely have let Lee Jordan in on the joke. He wondered whether it had anything to do with entering the Triwizard Tournament.</div>
