<div class="line_en">When I wake up, the other side of the bed is cold. My fingers stretch out, seeking Prim's warmth but finding only the rough canvas cover of the mattress. She must have had bad dreams and climbed in with our mother. Of course, she did. This is the day of the reaping.</div>

<div class="line_en">I prop myself up on one elbow. There's enough light in the bedroom to see them. My little sister, Prim, curled up on her side, cocooned in my mother's body, their cheeks pressed together. In sleep, my mother looks younger, still worn but not so beaten-down. Prim's face is as fresh as a raindrop, as lovely as the primrose for which she was named. My mother was very beautiful once, too. Or so they tell me.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sitting at Prim's knees, guarding her, is the world's ugliest cat. Mashed-in nose, half of one ear missing, eyes the color of rotting squash. Prim named him Buttercup, insisting that his muddy yellow coat matched the bright flower. He hates me. Or at least distrusts me. Even though it was years ago, I think he still remembers how I tried to drown him in a bucket when Prim brought him home. Scrawny kitten, belly swollen with worms, crawling with fleas. The last thing I needed was another mouth to feed. But Prim begged so hard, cried even, I had to let him stay. It turned out okay. My mother got rid of the vermin and he's a born mouser. Even catches the occasional rat. Sometimes, when I clean a kill, I feed Buttercup the entrails. He has stopped hissing at me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="坐在波丽姆膝盖边守护着她的是只世界上最丑的猫，大趴鼻子，一只耳朵缺了一半，眼睛是烂南瓜色儿的。波丽姆管它叫毛莨花，她坚持认为它那一身泥乎乎的黄毛能比得上这种好看的花儿。这只猫恨我，至少是不相信我。波丽姆刚把它带回家的时候，我就想在水桶里淹死它，这是好几年前的事儿了，可我想它一定还记着呢。当时这猫瘦得皮包骨头，长了寄生虫的肚子鼓凸着，身上爬满了跳蚤。又多了一张吃饭的嘴，这是我最不想要的。可波丽姆苦苦求我留下它，甚至大哭起来。我也就只好答应了。结果还不错，妈妈替它弄掉了一身的虫子。这只猫是个天生的捕鼠能手，连过路的耗子都不放过。有时候我清理猎物，会给它点动物内脏吃，它也就不对我呜呜地吼了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I swing my legs off the bed and slide into my hunting boots. Supple leather that has molded to my feet. I pull on trousers, a shirt, tuck my long dark braid up into a cap, and grab my forage bag. On the table, under a wooden bowl to protect it from hungry rats and cats alike, sits a perfect little goat cheese wrapped in basil leaves. Prim's gift to me on reaping day. I put the cheese carefully in my pocket as I slip outside.</div>

<div class="line_en">Our part of District 12, nicknamed the Seam, is usually crawling with coal miners heading out to the morning shift at this hour. Men and women with hunched shoulders, swollen knuckles, many who have long since stopped trying to scrub the coal dust out of their broken nails, the lines of their sunken faces. But today the black cinder streets are empty. Shutters on the squat gray houses are closed. The reaping isn't until two. May as well sleep in. If you can.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在12区，我们居住的这片地方，俗称“夹缝地带”，在这个时间通常会有一些零零散散去接早班的煤矿工人。他们弯腰驼背，累得膝关节肿大，因长期不清洗，脸上和指甲里渍满了煤污。但今天的煤渣路上却空无一人。灰秃秃的矮房子上的百叶窗都关着。收获节仪式要到下午两点才开始，也许大家都还睡着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Our house is almost at the edge of the Seam. I only have to pass a few gates to reach the scruffy field called the Meadow. Separating the Meadow from the woods, in fact enclosing all of District 12, is a high chain-link fence topped with barbed-wire loops. In theory, it's supposed to be electrified twenty-four hours a day as a deterrent to the predators that live in the woods -- packs of wild dogs, lone cougars, bears -- that used to threaten our streets. But since we're lucky to get two or three hours of electricity in the evenings, it's usually safe to touch. Even so, I always take a moment to listen carefully for the hum that means the fence is live. Right now, it's silent as a stone. Concealed by a clump of bushes, I flatten out on my belly and slide under a two-foot stretch that's been loose for years. There are several other weak spots in the fence, but this one is so close to home I almost always enter the woods here.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我家的房子在“夹缝地带”的最尽头。我只需经过几户人家的大门就能走到那个被称作“牧场”的布满荒草的地方。一条高高的围障横在“牧场”和林地之间，把整个十二区圈在里面，顶端装了带刺铁丝网。一般上讲，铁丝网是24小时通电的，防止林子的野兽威胁我们街区——那里有成群的野狼、独来独往的大胆的狗熊；但幸运的是，只有晚上才会有一两个小时的供电，所以此时触摸它是安全的。即便如此，我还会停一会，仔细听听电网是否通了电。此时的电网如一块顽石般寂然无声。一片灌木丛正好遮住人们的视线，我缩紧肚子从一条两英尺宽的缝隙钻了出去。这条缝已开了好多年了，在围障的其他地方还有几个突破点，但这个地方离家很近，我几乎总是从这儿钻到林子里去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As soon as I'm in the trees, I retrieve a bow and sheath of arrows from a hollow log. Electrified or not, the fence has been successful at keeping the flesh-eaters out of District 12. Inside the woods they roam freely, and there are added concerns like venomous snakes, rabid animals, and no real paths to follow. But there's also food if you know how to find it. My father knew and he taught me some before he was blown to bits in a mine explosion. There was nothing even to bury. I was eleven then. Five years later, I still wake up screaming for him to run.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我一到林子里，就从一截空木桩里找出了弓和箭。围障不管是否通了电，确实把食肉动物隔在了12区的外面。在林子里，它们逍遥自在地走动着。令人不安的是林中有毒蛇，还有凶残的动物，林子里也没什么路。可要是你懂行的话，总能在林子里找到吃的。我爸就是个懂行的人，他以前教过我怎么找食，不过他在一次矿井爆炸时被撕成了碎片，他的尸首已四处飞散，下葬时，他的尸骨已所剩无几。那时我只有十一岁。五年之后，我还时时从梦中惊醒，呼喊着让他赶快跑开。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Even though trespassing in the woods is illegal and poaching carries the severest of penalties, more people would risk it if they had weapons. But most are not bold enough to venture out with just a knife. My bow is a rarity, crafted by my father along with a few others that I keep well hidden in the woods, carefully wrapped in waterproof covers. My father could have made good money selling them, but if the officials found out he would have been publicly executed for inciting a rebellion. Most of the Peacekeepers turn a blind eye to the few of us who hunt because they're as hungry for fresh meat as anybody is. In fact, they're among our best customers. But the idea that someone might be arming the Seam would never have been allowed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="钻进林子是非法的，偷猎会受到严重的惩罚，但只要有枪，不少人还是愿意冒险一试，不过大多数人只带一把刀是不敢进林子的。我的弓箭不同寻常，是我爸和几个人一起做的，我把它小心地藏在林子里，上面套上了防水的罩。当时我爸要把这弓箭卖了，一定能挣上一笔，可要被当官的发现，就会以煽动暴乱的罪名被当众处死。多数知道这事的人也睁一只眼闭一只眼，因为他们和我们一样也饥肠辘辘，也想吃到新鲜的肉。事实上，他们是我们最好的买主。但在“夹缝地带”里持有武器是绝对禁止的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In the fall, a few brave souls sneak into the woods to harvest apples. But always in sight of the Meadow. Always close enough to run back to the safety of District 12 if trouble arises. "District Twelve. Where you can starve to death in safety," I mutter. Then I glance quickly over my shoulder. Even here, even in the middle of nowhere, you worry someone might overhear you.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="今年秋天，几个胆大的人潜到林子里去摘苹果。他们在林子里的位置离十二区很近，“牧场”就在目力所及的地方，一旦有情况，就迅速跑回去。“跑回十二区，这个能把人安全地饿死的地方”我咕哝着，说完我赶快朝身后看看。就算这荒无人烟，也得提防有人听到你说的话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When I was younger, I scared my mother to death, the things I would blurt out about District 12, about the people who rule our country, Panem, from the far-off city called the Capitol. Eventually I understood this would only lead us to more trouble. So I learned to hold my tongue and to turn my features into an indifferent mask so that no one could ever read my thoughts. Do my work quietly in school. Make only polite small talk in the public market. Discuss little more than trades in the Hob, which is the black market where I make most of my money. Even at home, where I am less pleasant, I avoid discussing tricky topics. Like the reaping, or food shortages, or the Hunger Games. Prim might begin to repeat my words and then where would we be?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="还在我少不更事的时候，有几次偶尔从嘴里冒出什么十二区呀，什么统治帕那姆国的大官呀，什么遥远的名叫凯匹特的城市呀之类的话，我妈就吓得半死。后来我终于明白了这么说只能给我们招惹麻烦。所以我学会管住自己的嘴，并装出一副事事都无所谓的样子，对我所想，无人知晓。我在学校安安静静地学习功课，在公共场合讲话礼貌，从不大声。对于在霍伯黑市赚钱的事，也几乎绝口不提。即使在家里，这个我不太开心的地方，也不触及微妙的话题，比如收获季节呀，食物短缺呀，或猎杀游戏呀什么的。波丽姆要是学我说话，那我们可怎么办？">查看中文翻译</div>

I can feel the muscles in my face relaxing, my pace quickening as I climb the hills to our place, a rock ledge overlooking a valley. A thicket of berry bushes protects it from unwanted eyes. The sight of him waiting there brings on a smile. Gale says I never smile except in the woods.</div>

I almost regretted it because he wasn't bad company. But I got a decent price for his pelt.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我的真名叫凯特尼斯，我早先告诉他我的名字时，声音小得像苍蝇嗡嗡，所以他就以为我叫猫薄荷（“我”的英文名字是Katniss，和英文薄荷猫Catnip谐音）。后来林子里有一个发疯的山猫到处跟着我讨要施舍的食物，所以这就成了我正式的外号。最终我不得不把那山猫杀死，因为它总是吓跑猎物；我还真有些后悔，因为这山猫是个不错的伴儿；不过我也用它的皮换了个好价钱。">查看中文翻译</div>

I take it in my hands, pull out the arrow, and hold the puncture in the crust to my nose, inhaling the fragrance that makes my mouth flood with saliva. Fine bread like this is for special occasions.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“瞧，我打到什么了？”盖尔用箭插到一块面包里，我忍不住笑了起来。这是块真正的发酵面包，不像我们用配给的口粮做的硬邦邦的扁面包。我把面包上插出的小孔对准鼻子，尽情地吸着它的芳香，嘴里立刻流出口水。像这样的好面包只有特殊场合才能见得到。">查看中文翻译</div>

Suddenly he falls into a Capitol accent as he mimics Effie Trinket, the maniacally upbeat woman who arrives once a year to read out the names at the reaping. "I almost forgot! Happy Hunger Games!" He plucks a few blackberries from the bushes around us. "And may the odds --" He tosses a berry in a high arc toward me.</div>

<div class="line_en">That's why my mother and Prim, with their light hair and blue eyes, always look out of place. They are. My mother's parents were part of the small merchant class that caters to officials, Peacekeepers, and the occasional Seam customer. They ran an apothecary shop in the nicer part of District 12. Since almost no one can afford doctors, apothecaries are our healers. My father got to know my mother because on his hunts he would sometimes collect medicinal herbs and sell them to her shop to be brewed into remedies. She must have really loved him to leave her home for the Seam. I try to remember that when all I can see is the woman who sat by, blank and unreachable, while her children turned to skin and bones.

The day is glorious, with a blue sky and soft breeze. The food's wonderful, with the cheese seeping into the warm bread and the berries bursting in our mouths.

<div class="line_en">On the way home, we swing by the Hob, the black market that operates in an abandoned warehouse that once held coal. When they came up with a more efficient system that transported the coal directly from the mines to the trains, the Hob gradually took over the space. Most businesses are closed by this time on reaping day, but the black market's still fairly busy. We easily trade six of the fish for good bread, the other two for salt. Greasy Sae, the bony old woman who sells bowls of hot soup from a large kettle, takes half the greens off our hands in exchange for a couple of chunks of paraffin. We might do a tad better elsewhere, but we make an effort to keep on good terms with Greasy Sae. She's the only one who can consistently be counted on to buy wild dog. We don't hunt them on purpose, but if you're attacked and you take out a dog or two, well, meat is meat. "Once it's in the soup, I'll call it beef," Greasy Sae says with a wink. No one in the Seam would turn up their nose at a good leg of wild dog, but the Peacekeepers who come to the Hob can afford to be a little choosier.</div>

<div class="line_en">But here's the catch. Say you are poor and starving as we were. You can opt to add your name more times in exchange for tesserae. Each tessera is worth a meager year's supply of grain and oil for one person. You may do this for each of your family members as well. So, at the age of twelve, I had my name entered four times. Once, because I had to, and three times for tesserae for grain and oil for myself, Prim, and my mother. In fact, every year I have needed to do this. And the entries are cumulative. So now, at the age of sixteen, my name will be in the reaping twenty times. Gale, who is eighteen and has been either helping or single-handedly feeding a family of five for seven years, will have his name in forty-two times.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可问题是，像我们这样挨饿的穷人，名字允许登记多次以换取食品券，一张食品券换取的食物相当于欠收年分配的谷物和油，每个家人也都可以这么做。所以到了十二岁，迫不得已，我的名字已经登记了四次，第一次，是必须登记，另外三次，为我、波丽姆和妈妈得到了三张食品券。事实上，我们每年都得这么干，而登记是累计的。所以现在到了十六岁，我的名字已经正被登记了二十次。而盖尔，在十八岁上，已经独自养活五口之家达七年时间，他的名字已经被登记了四十二次。">查看中文翻译</div>

The chance of her name being drawn is very slim compared to those of us who live in the Seam. Not impossible, but slim.

<div class="line_en">Gale knows his anger at Madge is misdirected. On other days, deep in the woods, I've listened to him rant about how the tesserae are just another tool to cause misery in our district. A way to plant hatred between the starving workers of the Seam and those who can generally count on supper and thereby ensure we will never trust one another. "It's to the Capitol's advantage to have us divided among ourselves," he might say if there were no ears to hear but mine. If it wasn't reaping day.

Odds are given on their ages, whether they're Seam or merchant, if they will break down and weep. Most refuse dealing with the racketeers but carefully, carefully.

<div class="line_en">Just as the town clock strikes two, the mayor steps up to the podium and begins to read. It's the same story every year. He tells of the history of Panem, the country that rose up out of the ashes of a place that was once called North America. He lists the disasters, the droughts, the storms, the fires, the encroaching seas that swallowed up so much of the land, the brutal war for what little sustenance remained. The result was Panem, a shining Capitol ringed by thirteen districts, which brought peace and prosperity to its citizens. Then came the Dark Days, the uprising of the districts against the Capitol. Twelve were defeated, the thirteenth obliterated. The Treaty of Treason gave us the new laws to guarantee peace and, as our yearly reminder that the Dark Days must never be repeated, it gave us the Hunger Games.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="镇里的大钟敲响两下，市长站起来走到讲席台上，开始宣读开幕词。年年如此。他讲了帕纳姆国的历史，它是一个建立在一片废墟之上，原来叫作北美洲地方。他历数了这个国家所遭受的各种灾难，包括干旱、暴风雨、火灾、不断吞噬大片土地的海水，以及生灵涂炭的残酷战争，直至最终建立起给人民带来和平与繁荣的帕纳姆国――一个以凯匹特为神圣中心、由十三个区组成的王国。可黑暗的时期来临了，各区暴动，反对凯匹特的统治。结果其中十二个区被打败，第十三区被灭。惩处叛逆的条约中制定了新的法律，以保证和平，也是为了每年提醒人们永远不要再让这段黑暗的历史重演。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The rules of the Hunger Games are simple. In punishment for the uprising, each of the twelve districts must provide one girl and one boy, called tributes, to participate. The twenty-four tributes will be imprisoned in a vast outdoor arena that could hold anything from a burning desert to a frozen wasteland. Over a period of several weeks, the competitors must fight to the death. The last tribute standing wins.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="根据新法律创立了“猎杀游戏”，游戏规则十分简单：作为对暴乱者的惩罚，十二个区中，每个区选派被称为“贡品”的男女青少年各一名，去参加比赛。这二十四名选手被关在一个巨大的室外竞技场内，里面有从炎热的沙漠到寒冷的荒原等各种各样的地形地貌和气候条件。在几周的时间内，所有的贡品必须战斗到死，最后的幸存者就是最终的胜出者。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Taking the kids from our districts, forcing them to kill one another while we watch -- this is the Capitol's way of reminding us how totally we are at their mercy. How little chance we would stand of surviving another rebellion. Whatever words they use, the real message is clear. "Look how we take your children and sacrifice them and there's nothing you can do. If you lift a finger, we will destroy every last one of you. Just as we did in District Thirteen."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="把孩子从他们的亲人身边带走，迫使他们相互残杀，还让我们观看。凯匹特就是这样使我们牢记他们所给予“恩赐”。而孩子们在混乱的搏杀中，生存的机会又是多么的微乎其微。无论他们怎样巧言如簧，所表达的意思只有一个，“看，我们可以带走你们的孩子，让他们用自己的命去做献祭，你们也无可奈何。要是你们敢抬一根指头，我们就会毁掉你们，一个不剩，就像我们灭掉第十三区一样。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">To make it humiliating as well as torturous, the Capitol requires us to treat the Hunger Games as a festivity, a sporting event pitting every district against the others. The last tribute alive receives a life of ease back home, and their district will be showered with prizes, largely consisting of food. All year, the Capitol will show the winning district gifts of grain and oil and even delicacies like sugar while the rest of us battle starvation.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="为了进一步折磨和羞辱我们，凯匹特还要求我们把这项活动当作一次节日的欢庆，当作让各区之间相互竞技的体育运动。最后一个幸存者可以回家安度余生，而他或她所在的区也会得到各种奖励，大部分是食物。整整一年，凯匹特会炫耀奖励给获胜区的各种礼物，包括粮食、油，甚至还有糖这样的美味；而剩下的各区不得不在饥饿中苦苦挣扎。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then he reads the list of past District 12 victors. In seventy-four years, we have had exactly two. Only one is still alive. Haymitch Abernathy, a paunchy, middle-aged man, who at this moment appears hollering something unintelligible, staggers onto the stage, and falls into the third chair. He's drunk. Very. The crowd responds with its token applause, but he's confused and tries to give Effie Trinket a big hug, which she barely manages to fend off.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后他宣读了以前十二区获胜者的名单。在过去整整七十四年中，我们只有两名获胜者，而只有其中的一个现在还活着，他就是黑密斯·阿伯纳瑟，一个大肚子中年男人。此时他走上台子，嘴里含混不清地抱怨着什么，然后跌坐在第三张椅子上。他已喝得烂醉如泥。人群发出象征性的掌声，可他还迷糊者，上去用力拥抱了一下艾菲·特琳奇，而她想推挡却无力拒绝。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The mayor looks distressed. Since all of this is being televised, right now District 12 is the laughingstock of Panem, and he knows it. He quickly tries to pull the attention back to the reaping by introducing Effie Trinket.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="市长看上去很不快。现场正在进行实况转播，而十二区也会成为整个帕纳姆国的笑料，他很清楚这点。他快速转而对艾菲·特琳奇进行介绍，以把人们的注意力迅速拉回到收获节庆典活动上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Bright and bubbly as ever, Effie Trinket trots to the podium and gives her signature, "Happy Hunger Games! And may the odds be ever in your favor!" Her pink hair must be a wig because her curls have shifted slightly off-center since her encounter with Haymitch. She goes on a bit about what an honor it is to be here, although everyone knows she's just aching to get bumped up to a better district where they have proper victors, not drunks who molest you in front of the entire nation.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="艾菲·特琳奇仍像以前一样春风满面，她快速走到讲席台，发出庆典活动开始的信号，“猎杀游戏快乐，祝你们好运！”她的桃红色头发肯定是假发，被黑密斯拥抱过后，发卷微微歪向一边。她又说了些很荣幸能来到这里之类的话，可大家心里都清楚，她正为这事懊丧无比，因为这个区的胜出者碰巧是个醉汉，让她当着全国人的面出了丑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Through the crowd, I spot Gale looking back at me with a ghost of a smile. As reapings go, this one at least has a slight entertainment factor. But suddenly I am thinking of Gale and his forty-two names in that big glass ball and how the odds are not in his favor. Not compared to a lot of the boys. And maybe he's thinking the same thing about me because his face darkens and he turns away. "But there are still thousands of slips," I wish I could whisper to him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在人群中，我看到盖尔正一脸诡秘的微笑，回视着我。在收获节仪式上，他这么笑还真有点逗。可我突然想起盖尔和他的四十二张纸条也在那个大玻璃球里，和其他的孩子比起来，形式对他并不十分有利。也许他也是这么想我的，他的脸突然阴沉下来，扭过头去。“可还有其他几千张纸条呢。”我真想这么跟他说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It's time for the drawing. Effie Trinket says as she always does, "Ladies first!" and crosses to the glass ball with the girls' names. She reaches in, digs her hand deep into the ball, and pulls out a slip of paper. The crowd draws in a collective breath and then you can hear a pin drop, and I'm feeling nauseous and so desperately hoping that it's not me, that it's not me, that it's not me.</div>
