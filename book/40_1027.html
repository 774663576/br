<div class="line_en">Two weeks before, at Mariam's prodding, Jalil had let on that an American film was playing at his cinema. It was a special kind of film, what he'd called a cartoon. The entire film was a series of drawings, he said, thousands of them, so that when they were made into a film and projected onto a screen you had the illusion that the drawings were moving. Jalil said the film told the story of an old, childless toymaker who is lonely and desperately wants a son. So he carves a puppet, a boy, who magically comes to life. Mariam had asked him to tell her more, and Jalil said that the old man and his puppet had all sorts of adventures, that there was a place called Pleasure Island, and bad boys who turned into donkeys. They even got swallowed by a whale at the end, the puppet and his father. Mariam had told Mullah Faizullah all about this film.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两个星期前，在玛丽雅姆的追问下，扎里勒透露说他的电影院正在放映一部美国电影。那是一部特殊的电影，他说叫卡通片。整部电影是一系列图画组成的，他说，成千上万张画，所以它们能够拼成一部电影，投射在银幕上，让人们产生一种幻觉，觉得那些画会动。扎里勒说这部电影讲的是一个制作玩具的人的故事，他年纪大了，又没有孩子，感到很孤单，非常想要一个孩子。所以他刻了一个木偶，是个男孩，它奇迹般地获得了生命。玛丽雅姆求他告诉她更多的内容，扎里勒说老人和他的木偶经历了各种各样的冒险，还说电影里有个地方叫快乐岛，坏男孩到岛上会变成驴子。在电影的结尾，他们，木偶和他的父亲，甚至还被一条鲸鱼吞到肚子里去了。玛丽雅姆把这些统统说给法苏拉赫毛拉听。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">THERE WAS A LOOKOUT, on the edge of the clearing, where Mariam liked to go. She sat there now, on dry, warm grass. Herat was visible from here, spread below her like a child's board game: the Women's Garden to the north of the city, Char-suq Bazaar and the ruins of Alexander the Great's old citadel to the south. She could make out the minarets in the distance, like the dusty fingers of giants, and the streets that she imagined were milling with people, carts, mules. She saw swallows swooping and circling overhead. She was envious of these birds. They had been to Herat. They had flown over its mosques, its bazaars. Maybe they had landed on the walls of Jalil's home, on the front steps of his cinema.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="空地的边缘有一个能够眺望远处的地方，玛丽雅姆喜欢到那儿去。这时她就在那儿，坐在温暖的干草上。赫拉特从这儿清晰可见，就像儿童的积木游戏般在她身下展开：城市的北边是女子公园，夏尔苏克市场和亚历山大大帝的古城堡遗址在南边。她能够辨认出远处的尖塔，像是巨人污秽的手指；还有一些街道，她想像街道上人来人往，车水马龙。她看到燕子在头顶盘旋飞翔。她妒忌这些飞鸟。它们去过赫拉特。它们曾经在它的清真寺、在它的市场上方翱翔。也许它们还曾降落在扎里勒家的墙壁和他的电影院前面的台阶上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">THE NEXT MORNING, Mariam wore a cream-colored dress that fell to her knees, cotton trousers, and a green hijab over her hair. She agonized a bit over the hijab, its being green and not matching the dress, but it would have to do -- moths had eaten holes into her white one.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="翌日早晨，玛丽雅姆穿了一件垂到膝盖的奶白色裙子，一条棉布裤子，头发上披着绿色的头巾。这条绿色的头巾和裙子并不相称，但只好将就——白色那条被虫子咬出好几个洞了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She checked the clock. It was an old hand-wound clock with black numbers on a mint green face, a present from Mullah Faizullah. It was nine o'clock. She wondered where Nana was.

<div class="line_en">Mariam climbed onto the gari. They rode in silence, side by side. On the way there, Mariam saw herb shops, and open-fronted cubbyholes where shoppers bought oranges and pears, books, shawls, even falcons. Children played marbles in circles drawn in dust. Outside teahouses, on carpet-covered wooden platforms, men drank tea and smoked tobacco from hookahs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛丽雅姆爬上了马车。他们并排坐着，一路无语。玛丽雅姆看到沿途有些药草铺，还有些敞开的货架，买东西的人能够从上面买到橙子、梨、书籍、围巾，甚至猎鹰。玩弹球的孩子们围成一圈圈，踢得尘土飞扬。茶馆外面，在铺了地毯的木板平台上，男人们喝着茶，抽着水烟袋。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For a moment, Mariam heard Nana's voice in her head, mocking, dousing the deep-seated glow of her hopes. With shaky legs, Mariam approached the front door of the house. She put her hands on the walls. They were so tall, so foreboding, Jalil's walls. She had to crane her neck to see where the tops of cypress trees protruded over them from the other side. The treetops swayed in the breeze, and she imagined they were nodding their welcome to her. Mariam steadied herself against the waves of dismay passing through her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="刹那间，娜娜的声音在玛丽雅姆脑海中响起，嘲弄着她，试图浇灭她内心深处的希望的光芒。玛丽雅姆双腿发抖，向那座房子的前门走去。她把手放在墙壁上。它们是这么高，这么森严，扎里勒家的墙壁。她得把脖子伸直了，才能见到墙头有从另一边伸出来的柏树树冠。树冠在和风中微微晃动，她想像它们是在点头欢迎她的到来。玛丽雅姆抑制心中阵阵慌乱，稳住了自己。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">MARIAM HAD NEVER before touched a car. She ran her fingers along the hood of Jalil's car, which was black, shiny, with glittering wheels in which Mariam saw a flattened, widened version of herself. The seats were made of white leather. Behind the steering wheel, Mariam saw round glass panels with needles behind them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛丽雅姆从来没有碰过轿车。她用手指抚摸扎里勒的轿车的前车盖。黑色的，闪闪发亮。轿车的轮毂光可鉴人，玛丽雅姆从轮毂上看到一个扁平的、拉伸的自己。轿车皮椅是白色的。玛丽雅姆看到方向盘后面有几个圆形的玻璃仪表，里面有一些指针。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Over the years, Mariam would have ample occasion to think about how things might have turned out if she had let the driver take her back to the kolba. But she didn't. She spent the night outside Jalil's house. She watched the sky darken, the shadows engulf the neighboring house-fronts. The tattooed girl brought her some bread and a plate of rice, which Mariam said she didn't want. The girl left it near Mariam. From time to time, Mariam heard footsteps down the street, doors swinging open, muffled greetings. Electric lights came on, and windows glowed dimly. Dogs barked. When she could no longer resist the hunger, Mariam ate the plate of rice and the bread. Then she listened to the crickets chirping from gardens. Overhead, clouds slid past a pale moon.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="多年以后，玛丽雅姆将会有很多机会去设想，如果她让司机开车送她回泥屋，事情会变成什么样子。但她拒绝了。那天夜里，她是在扎里勒的房子外面度过的。她看着天空变黑，阴影吞噬了邻近房子的正面。那个有刺青的女孩给她带来几片面包和一盘米饭，但玛丽雅姆说她不想吃。女孩把食物留在玛丽雅姆身边。一次又一次，玛丽雅姆听到街道那边传来脚步走动的声音，房门摇晃着打开的声音，人们压低嗓子相互问候的声音。各处的电灯点亮了，微茫的光线从窗户透射出来。狗儿吠叫。等到饿得实在不行的时候，玛丽雅姆吃了那盘米饭和面包。然后她倾听着各家各户的花园中蟋蟀的叫声。上方，几朵云彩飘过苍白的月亮。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In the handful of seconds that she was in Jalil's garden, Mariam's eyes registered seeing a gleaming glass structure with plants inside it, grape vines clinging to wooden trellises, a fishpond built with gray blocks of stone, fruit trees, and bushes of brightly colored flowers everywhere. Her gaze skimmed over all of these things before they found a face, across the garden, in an upstairs window. The face was there for only an instant, a flash, but long enough. Long enough for Mariam to see the eyes widen, the mouth open. Then it snapped away from view. A hand appeared and frantically pulled at a cord. The curtains fell shut.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没过几秒钟，她便来到扎里勒的花园。玛丽雅姆匆忙间瞥见一个里面种着植物的闪亮玻璃缸，一个爬满葡萄藤的木架子，一个用灰色的石块砌成的鱼池，几株果树，还有到处都是的开着鲜花的灌木丛。看见所有这些东西之后，她的眼光碰到了一张脸庞，在花园对面，在一扇楼上的窗户里面。那张面孔只在那儿停留了一瞬间，一闪而过，但是已经足够长久了。长久得玛丽雅姆能够看清那双眼睛变大，那个嘴巴张开。接着它突然消失在视线之外。一只手出现了，忙乱地拉着一根绳索。窗帘拉上了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">THE DRIVER TALKED in a muted, consoling tone as he drove. Mariam did not hear him. All during the ride, as she bounced in the backseat, she cried. They were tears of grief, of anger, of disillusionment. But mainly tears of a deep, deep shame at how foolishly she had given herself over to Jalil, how she had fretted over what dress to wear, over the mismatching hijab, walking all the way here, refusing to leave, sleeping on the street like a stray dog. And she was ashamed of how she had dismissed her mother's stricken looks, her puffy eyes. Nana, who had warned her, who had been right all along.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="司机一边开车，一边压低了嗓子安慰她。玛丽雅姆没有听他说话。坐在后座的她一路上颠簸，哭个不停。她流下的是悲哀的眼泪，是愤怒的眼泪，是梦想破灭的眼泪。但更是深深的、深深的屈辱的眼泪；她曾经那样思念扎里勒，为穿什么衣服烦恼，为那条不相称的头巾烦恼，一路走到这里，拒绝离开，像流浪狗般露宿街头，现在才明白这一切有多么愚蠢。她也为自己曾经对母亲严厉的眼神、哭肿的双眼不理不闻而惭愧。娜娜早就警告过她，娜娜一直都是对的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mariam kept thinking of his face in the upstairs window. He let her sleep on the street. On the street. Mariam cried lying down. She didn't sit up, didn't want to be seen. She imagined all of Herat knew this morning how she'd disgraced herself. She wished Mullah Faizullah were here so she could put her head on his lap and let him comfort her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛丽雅姆一直想着他那张在楼上窗户后面出现的脸。他让她露宿街头。露宿街头。玛丽雅姆哭喊着躺下。她没有坐起来，不想被人看到。她觉得今天早上，赫拉特所有的人都知道她如何自取其辱。她希望法苏拉赫毛拉就在身边，这样的话她就能够把头埋进他的膝盖，让他来安慰她。">查看中文翻译</div>

A gust of wind blew and parted the drooping branches of the weeping willow like a curtain, and Mariam caught a glimpse of what was beneath the tree: the straight-backed chair, overturned. The rope dropping from a high branch. Nana dangling at the end of it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但他不够快。玛丽雅姆看到了。一阵大风吹过，吹开了那像窗帘般垂着的柳树枝条，玛丽雅姆见到了树下的景象：那张直背的椅子，翻倒在地。一条绳子从高处的树枝垂下来。娜娜在绳子末端晃荡着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She let him guide her across the road and up the track. There was honeysuckle growing along the path, and milkweed too. Bees were buzzing over twinkling wildflowers. The driver took her hand and helped her cross the stream. Then he let go, and he was talking about how Herat's famous one hundred and twenty days' winds would start blowing soon, from midmorning to dusk, and how the sand flies would go on a feeding frenzy, and then suddenly he was standing in front of her, trying to cover her eyes, pushing her back the way they had come and saying, "Go back! No. Don't look now. Turn around! Go back!"</div>
