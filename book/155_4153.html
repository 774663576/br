<div class="line_en">Thomas Robinson reached around, ran his fingers under his left arm and lifted it. He guided his arm to the Bible and his rubber-like left hand sought contact with the black binding. As he raised his right hand, the useless one slipped off the Bible and hit the clerk's table. He was trying again when Judge Taylor growled, "That'll do, Tom." Tom took the oath and stepped into the witness chair. Atticus very quickly induced him to tell us:</div>

<div class="line_en">As Tom Robinson gave his testimony, it came to me that Mayella Ewell must have been the loneliest person in the world. She was even lonelier than Boo Radley, who had not been out of the house in twenty-five years. When Atticus asked had she any friends, she seemed not to know what he meant, then she thought he was making fun of her. She was as sad, I thought, as what Jem called a mixed child: white people wouldn't have anything to do with her because she lived among pigs; Negroes wouldn't have anything to do with her because she was white. She couldn't live like Mr. Dolphus Raymond, who preferred the company of Negroes, because she didn't own a riverbank and she wasn't from a fine old family. Nobody said, "That's just their way," about the Ewells. Maycomb gave them Christmas baskets, welfare money, and the back of its hand. Tom Robinson was probably the only person who was ever decent to her. But she said he took advantage of her, and when she stood up she looked at him as if he were dirt beneath her feet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="汤姆·鲁宾逊提供证词时，我突然感到，梅耶拉·尤厄尔一定是世界上最感寂寞的人，比二十五年未出房门的布·拉德利还要感到寂寞些。阿迪克斯问她有没有朋友时，她开始仿佛不懂他问的是什么，后来又以为他在奚落她。我想，她一定很不快乐，就像杰姆说的那混血儿一样：白人不想与她打交道，因为她与猪猡一般的人住在一起，黑人不敢与她打交道，因为她是白人。她不能像多尔佛斯·雷蒙德先生——一个喜欢与黑人交往的人那样生活，因为她既不拥有一条河岸的家产，也不是出身于名门望族。谈到尤厄尔家时，人们不屑于提及他们家的生活方式。梅科姆镇给他们家提供福利费以及其他的帮助，圣诞节时还用篮子给他们送食品。可能只有汤姆·鲁宾逊一个人对梅耶拉小姐彬彬有礼。但是，她说他欺侮她，她站起来看着他时，好像是看着脚下的一堆尘土。">查看中文翻译</div>

He seemed to be a respectable Negro, and a respectable Negro would never go up into somebody's yard of his own volition.</div>

Well, I went inside the fence an' looked around for some kindlin' to work on, but I didn't see none, and she says, 'Naw, I got somethin' for you to do in the house. Th' old door's off its hinges an' fall's comin' on pretty fast.' I said you got a screwdriver, Miss Mayella? She said she sho' had. Well, I went up the steps an' she motioned me to come inside, and I went in the front room an' looked at the door. I said Miss Mayella, this door look all right. I pulled it back'n forth and those hinges was all right. Then she shet the door in my face.
