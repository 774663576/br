<div class="line_en">Since I've been home I've been trying hard to mend my relationship with my mother. Asking her to do things for me instead of brushing aside any offer of help, as I did for years out of anger. Letting her handle all the money I won. Returning her hugs instead of tolerating them. My time in the arena made me realize how I needed to stop punishing her for something she couldn't help, specifically the crushing depression she fell into after my father's death. Because sometimes things happen to people and they're not equipped to deal with them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="自从我回家以后，就尽量修复和妈妈的关系，让她为我做些事情，而不是拒绝她的一切好意，不会像从前那样，因为生她的气而拒绝她。我把挣的钱都交到她手里，时不时主动去拥抱她而不是捏着鼻子忍受她的拥抱。在竞技场的日子使我明白，了我不应该再去为她无力做到的事而惩罚她，特别是不应为爸爸过世后她的绝望状态而责备她。因为有时候人遭遇变故，自身却无力抵挡。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Besides, there's one wonderful thing she did when I arrived back in the district. After our families and friends had greeted Peeta and me at the train station, there were a few questions allowed from reporters. Someone asked my mother what she thought of my new boyfriend, and she replied that, while Peeta was the very model of what a young man should be, I wasn't old enough to have any boyfriend at all. She followed this with a pointed look at Peeta. There was a lot of laughter and comments like "Somebody's in trouble" from the press, and Peeta dropped my hand and sidestepped away from me. That didn't last long -- there was too much pressure to act otherwise -- but it gave us an excuse to be a little more reserved than we'd been in the Capitol. And maybe it can help account for how little I've been seen in Peeta's company since the cameras left.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="另外，在我回到十二区后，她还做了一件很棒的事。当家人和朋友在车站见到我和皮塔以后，记者可以问一些问题。有人间妈妈她认为我的新男朋友怎么样，她回答说，皮塔是一个理想青年，可我还根本不到谈恋爱的年龄。她说完还看了一眼皮塔。这话引来了很多的笑声，也引来了记者们诸如“有人要遇到麻烦了”等评论。皮塔听到后扔掉了我的手，走到了一旁去。—然而这种情况没有持续很长时间，我们面临很大的压力，必须要拉起手来，但至少这件事给我们一个借口，可以使我们不必像在凯匹特时那样地亲密无间。也许这也藉以说明了为什么记者撤离后我和皮塔不常在一起的原因。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I go upstairs to the bathroom, where a steaming tub awaits. My mother has added a small bag of dried flowers that perfumes the air. None of us are used to the luxury of turning on a tap and having a limitless supply of hot water at our fingertips. We had only cold at our home in the Seam, and a bath meant boiling the rest over the fire. I undress and lower myself into the silky water -- my mother has poured in some kind of oil as well -- and try to get a grip on things.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我上楼来到浴室，满满一浴缸的水正等着我，妈妈已经用一袋干花为浴室熏香。我们以前在“夹缝地带”的家中从未这样奢侈，那里只有冷水，洗澡的话要把水在炉子上烧开。可现在一打开水龙头热水就会汩汩流出。妈妈还在水里放了精油，水柔润丝滑，我脱掉衣服泡到水里，接着便开始盘算起自己的心事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The first question is who to tell, if anyone. Not my mother or Prim, obviously; they'd only become sick with worry. Not Gale. Even if I could get word to him. What would he do with the information, anyway? If he were alone, I might try to persuade him to run away. Certainly he could survive in the woods. But he's not alone and he'd never leave his family. Or me. When I get home I'll have to tell him something about why our Sundays are a thing of the past, but I can't think about that now. Only about my next move. Besides, Gale's already so angry and frustrated with the Capitol that I sometimes think he's going to arrange his own uprising. The last thing he needs is an incentive. No, I can't tell anyone I'm leaving behind in District 12.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第一个问题是，应该把这一切告诉谁？能告诉谁？显然，妈妈和波丽姆都不行，她们只会担心得要命。盖尔也不行。就算我把话传给他，他又能怎样？如果他只是孤身一人，我可以让他逃跑。当然，他在丛林中能够生存，但他不是一个人，他永远不可能离开他的家人。或者我。如果是我刚回到家里时，我还可以告诉他我们的一切已成为过去，可这已经是不可能的了。现在只能考虑下一步该怎么办。另外，盖尔对凯匹特已经十分不满，我有时候真觉得他自己都要策划暴动了。他最不需．要的是一个诱因。不，十二区的任何人我都不能告诉。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I slide down into the water, letting it block out the sounds around me. I wish the tub would expand so I could go swimming, like I used to on hot summer Sundays in the woods with my father. Those days were a special treat. We would leave early in the morning and hike farther into the woods than usual to a small lake he'd found while hunting. I don't even remember learning to swim, I was so young when he taught me. I just remember diving, turning somersaults, and paddling around. The muddy bottom of the lake beneath my toes. The smell of blossoms and greenery. Floating on my back, as I am now, staring at the blue sky while the chatter of the woods was muted by the water. He'd bag the waterfowl that nested around the shore, I'd hunt for eggs in the grasses, and we'd both dig for katniss roots, the plant for which he named me, in the shallows. At night, when we got home, my mother would pretend not to recognize me because I was so clean. Then she'd cook up an amazing dinner of roasted duck and baked katniss tubers with gravy.</div>

But my guess is Cinna might already be at risk, and I don't want to pull him into any more trouble by closer association with me. Then there's Peeta, who will be my partner in this deception, but how do I begin that conversation? Hey, Peeta, remember how I told you I was kind of faking being in love with you? Well, I really need you to forget about that now and act extra in love with me or the president might kill Gale. I can't do it. Besides, Peeta will perform well whether he knows what's at stake or not. That leaves Haymitch. Drunken, cranky, confrontational Haymitch, who I just poured a basin of ice water on. As my mentor in the Games it was his duty to keep me alive. I only hope he's still up for the job.</div>

<div class="line_en">I never took Gale to the lake. I could have. It's time-consuming to get there, but the waterfowl are such easy pickings you can make up for lost hunting time. It's a place I've never really wanted to share with anyone, though, a place that belonged only to my father and me. Since the Games, when I've had little to occupy my days, I've gone there a couple of times. The swimming was still nice, but mostly the visits depressed me. Over the course of the last five years, the lake's remarkably unchanged and I'm almost unrecognizable.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我从没带盖尔去过那片湖，我应该带他去。到那里要花很长时间，但那里的水鸭子很容易捕到，在打猎的淡季可以接济一下，可是，我从没真心想过和任何人分享那片湖水，这是一片只属于爸爸和我的地方。自从饥饿游戏结束后，我无事可做，去过那里几次。在那里游泳仍然很好，但我心情感到压抑。虽然五年已经过去，但湖水仍澄澈如初，没有什么变化；可我完全像变了一个人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Katniss, your eyebrows!" Venia shrieks right off, and even with the black cloud hanging over me, I have to stifle a laugh. Her aqua hair has been styled so it sticks out in sharp points all over her head, and the gold tattoos that used to be confined above her brows have curled around under her eyes, all contributing to the impression that I've literally shocked her.</div>

I can't walk by the school now without wondering what kid I'll have to coach. But to make things even worse, this is the year of the Seventy-fifth Hunger Games, and that means it's also a Quarter Quell. They occur every twenty-five years, marking the anniversary of the districts' defeat with over-the-top celebrations and, for extra fun, some miserable twist for the tributes. I've never been alive for one, of course. But in school I remember hearing that for the second Quarter Quell, the Capitol demanded that twice the number of tributes be provided for the arena. The teachers didn't go into much more detail, which is surprising, because that was the year District 12's very own Haymitch Abernathy won the crown.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“啊，是啊。”我不温不火地说。我也只能这么说了。每年，指导老师的工作就是一场噩梦。现在每当我经过学校时，总想着我可能会指导哪一个孩子。更糟糕的是，今年即将举办第七十五届饥饿游戏，也就是说又将举办每二十五年一次的世纪极限赛，尽管多数区在上届比赛中失败，却要举行荒唐的庆典仪式，为了增加庆典活动的乐趣，还要各区“贡品”遭受更多折磨。当然，我活这么大，还没赶上过一次世纪极限赛，但在学校时好像听老师说过第二届世纪极限赛，凯匹特要求每区选出两倍于以往的选手参加比赛。老师并没有详细说，可这很让人吃惊，因为正是这一年十二区的黑密斯·阿伯纳瑟摘得桂冠。">查看中文翻译</div>

Apparently they've been given instruction to prepare only my hands and face, probably because everything else will be covered in the cold weather. Flavius badly wants to use his own trademark purple lipstick on me but resigns himself to a pink as they begin to color my face and nails. I can see by the palette Cinna has assigned that we're going for girlish, not sexy. Good. I'll never convince anyone of anything if I'm trying to be provocative.

<div class="line_en">My mother comes in, somewhat shyly, and says that Cinna has asked her to show the preps how she did my hair the day of the reaping. They respond with enthusiasm and then watch, thoroughly engrossed, as she breaks down the process of the elaborate braided hairdo. In the mirror, I can see their earnest faces following her every move, their eagerness when it is their turn to try a step. In fact, all three are so readily respectful and nice to my mother that I feel bad about how I go around feeling so superior to them. Who knows who I would be or what I would talk about if I'd been raised in the Capitol? Maybe my biggest regret would be having feathered costumes at my birthday party, too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时妈妈走进屋来，她有一点羞怯，告诉我的化妆师，西纳让她把以前在收获节仪式上给我做的发型做给他们看看。我的化妆师们表示出极大的热情，妈妈给我编复杂的辫子时，他们全神贯注地看着。我在镜子里，看到他们认真地观看着妈妈的每一个动作，轮到他们时，大家都跃跃欲试。说实话，当他们三个对妈妈那么尊敬、那么好的时候，我为以前自己那么瞧不起他们而感到很愧疚。如果我也在凯匹特长大，谁能说好我会成为什么样的人、说什么样的话？也许到那时，我最大的遗憾也是在自己的生日晚会上让所有的人都穿了羽毛服装呢。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When my hair is done, I find Cinna downstairs in the living room, and just the sight of him makes me feel more hopeful. He looks the same as always, simple clothes, short brown hair, just a hint of gold eyeliner. We embrace, and I can barely keep from spilling out the entire episode with President Snow. But no, I've decided to tell Haymitch first. He'll know best who to burden with it. It's so easy to talk to Cinna, though. Lately we've been speaking a lot on the telephone that came with the house. It's sort of a joke, because almost no one else we know owns one. There's Peeta, but obviously I don't call him. Haymitch tore his out of the wall years ago. My friend Madge, the mayor's daughter, has a telephone in her house, but if we want to talk, we do it in person. At first, the thing barely ever got used. Then Cinna started to call to work on my talent.</div>

It can be anything, really, anything that they can interview you about. Peeta, it turns out, actually has a talent, which is painting. He's been frosting those cakes and cookies for years in his family's bakery. But now that he's rich, he can afford to smear real paint on canvases. I don't have a talent, unless you count hunting illegally, which they don't. Or maybe singing, which I wouldn't do for the Capitol in a million years. My mother tried to interest me in a variety of suitable alternatives from a list Effie Trinket sent her. Cooking, flower arranging, playing the flute. None of them took, although Prim had a knack for all three. Finally Cinna stepped in and offered to help me develop my passion for designing clothes, which really required development since it was nonexistent. But I said yes because it meant getting to talk to Cinna, and he promised he'd do all the work.</div>

As badly as I have hurt him, he won't expose me in front of the cameras. Won't condemn me with a halfhearted kiss. He's still looking out for me. Just as he did in the arena.
