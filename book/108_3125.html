<div class="line_en">Death is a strange thing. People live their whole lives as if it does not exist, and yet it's often one of the great motivations for living. Some of us, in time, become so conscious of it that we live harder, more obstinately, with more fury. Some need its constant presence to even be aware of its antithesis. Others become so preoccupied with it that they go into the waiting room long before it has announced its arrival. We fear it, yet most of us fear more than anything that it may take someone other than ourselves. For the greatest fear of death is always that it will pass us by. And leave us there alone.</div>

<div class="line_en">People had always said that Ove was "bitter." But he wasn't bloody bitter. He just didn't go around grinning the whole time. Did that mean one had to be treated like a criminal? Ove hardly thought so. Something inside a man goes to pieces when he has to bury the only person who ever understood him. There is no time to heal that sort of wound.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="人们总是说欧维刻薄。欧维一点都不刻薄，他只是不会嬉皮笑脸罢了。难道这就要送去判刑？欧维可不这么想。但当他不得不亲手埋葬世上唯一理解他的人时，还是会心碎欲裂。没有什么时间可以抚平这样的创伤。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And time is a curious thing. Most of us only live for the time that lies right ahead of us. A few days, weeks, years. One of the most painful moments in a person's life probably comes with the insight that an age has been reached when there is more to look back on than ahead. And when time no longer lies ahead of one, other things have to be lived for. Memories, perhaps. Afternoons in the sun with someone's hand clutched in one's own. The fragrance of flowerbeds in fresh bloom. Sundays in a café. Grandchildren, perhaps. One finds a way of living for the sake of someone else's future. And it wasn't as if Ove also died when Sonja left him. He just stopped living.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="时间是一桩奇怪的事情。大多数人只为了未来生活。几天之后，几周之后，或者几年。每个人一生中最恼人的那一刻可能就是突然意识到自己已经到了回忆比展望更多的年龄。当来日无多的时候，必须有别的动力让人活下去。或许是回忆。午后的阳光中牵着某人的手，鲜花绽放的花坛，周日的咖啡馆。或许是孙子孙女。人们为了别人的未来继续生活。索雅离开欧维的时候，他并没有一起死去。他只是不再活着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When the hospital staff refused to let Parvaneh accompany Ove's stretcher into the operating room, it took the combined efforts of Patrick, Jimmy, Anders, Adrian, Mirsad, and four nurses to hold her back, and her flying fists. When a doctor told her to consider the fact that she was pregnant and cautioned her to sit down and "take it easy," Parvaneh overturned one of the wooden benches in the waiting room so that it landed on his foot. And when another doctor came out of a door with a clinically neutral expression and a curt way of expressing himself about "preparing yourselves for the worst," she screamed out loud and collapsed on the floor like a shattered porcelain vase. Her face buried in her hands.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="医护人员不让帕尔瓦娜跟随欧维的担架进入手术室的时候，帕特里克、吉米、安德斯、阿德里安、米尔莎德和四个护士合力按住她紧握的拳头才拦了下来。当医生劝她想想自己怀有身孕最好还是冷静一下，她把候诊室里的一张木制长凳掀翻在医生脚上。当另一个医生面无表情地走出手术室，简短地说“最好准备接受最坏的情况”时，她哭喊着瘫倒在地，像个破碎的瓷瓶，把脸深埋进掌心。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It's half past three in the morning when a nurse comes to get her. She has refused to leave the waiting room. Her hair is one big mess, her eyes bloodshot and caked with streams of dried tears and mascara. When she steps into the little room at the end of the corridor she looks so weak at first that a nurse rushes forward to stop the pregnant woman crumbling to pieces as she crosses the threshold. Parvaneh supports herself against the doorframe, takes a deep breath, smiles an infinitely faint smile at the nurse, and assures her that she's "okay." She takes a step into the room and remains there for a second, as if for the first time that night she can take in the full enormity of what has happened.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凌晨三点半，一个护士走出来接她。她拒绝离开候诊室，尽管身边所有人都在劝她。除了帕特里克。他更了解她。但其他人并没有见过她发怒的样子，不知道她不是个任人发号施令的女人，不管有没有怀孕。她的头发一团糟。眼睛血红，眼圈周遭风干的泪水混合着眼影晕成一片。踏进走廊尽头那间小房间的时候，她看上去那么虚弱，一个护士急忙冲上前来，防止这个孕妇在跨过门槛的时候“散架”。帕尔瓦娜撑着门框，深吸一口气，挤出一丝微笑，告诉那个护士她没事。她踏进房间，站了几秒钟。就像是第一次停下来接受今晚发生的一切。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And then she hits him on the arm again. And then he sees the wisdom of keeping quiet for a while. But she stays there with his hand in hers and slumps into the chair, with that mix of agitation, empathy, and sheer terror in those big brown eyes of hers. At this point he lifts his other hand and strokes her hair. He has tubes going up his nose and his chest moves strenuously under the covers. As if his every breath is one long impulse of pain. His words come out wheezing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她又开始拍他的胳膊。于是他决定还是什么都不说的好。而当她握着他的手瘫坐在椅子上，棕色的大眼睛混合着悸动、悲伤和惊恐的时候，他举起另一只手抚摸着她的头发。他的鼻孔里插着管子，胸口在毯子下沉重地起伏着。就好像每一次呼吸都是一场漫长的疼痛。话语间，气若游丝：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then she goes up to the bed and stands next to it with fresh tears in her eyes. With both palms she starts thumping Ove's arm.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Don't even think about it." Ove's fingers move weakly; she grabs them with both hands and puts her forehead in the palm of his hand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维的手指疲惫地在手臂下方挪动，帕尔瓦娜用双手握住，把额头搁在他的掌心上，哭了起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It takes about forty minutes before any of the nurses finally have the guts to go back into the room. A few moments later a bespectacled young doctor wearing plastic slippers who, in Ove's view, has the distinct appearance of someone with a stick up his ass, comes into the room and stands dozily by the bed. He looks down at a paper.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="四十分钟过后，才有护士敢把头伸进病房来一探究竟。又过了一会儿，进来一个戴眼镜的年轻医生，穿一双塑料拖鞋，在欧维看来显然屁股上插了根棍子，他站到床边，低头看着一张纸。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="两个人都没有进一步解释的意思，除了帕尔瓦娜拍拍欧维笑道：“哦！最近亲属关系！”外加欧维嘟囔了一句“闭嘴”，医生只好叹口气，继续说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="帕尔瓦娜满脸惊疑地瞪着医生的时候，他难以置信地叹了口气，那神情，就像那些戴眼镜、穿塑料拖鞋、屁股上插根棍子的年轻医生们，在医学院里还没学会那些该死的常识性礼仪，就跑来行医了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Parvaneh stares blankly at him for a very long time. And then she looks at Ove in the bed, in a very searching way. And then she looks at the doctor again as if she's waiting for him to throw out his arms and start making jazzy movements with his fingers and crying out: "Only joking!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="帕尔瓦娜又瞪了他好一会儿，然后往欧维身上一阵扫视。然后她又看向医生，就好像在等他双手一摊打着响指说“逗你玩”。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And when he doesn't do this she starts to laugh. First it's more like a cough, then as if she's holding back a sneeze, and before long it's a long, sustained, raucous bout of giggling. She holds on to the side of the bed, waves her hand in front of her face as if to fan herself into stopping, but it doesn't help. And then at last it turns into one loud, long-drawn belly laugh that bursts out of the room and makes the nurses in the corridor stick their heads through the door and ask in wonder, "What's going on in here?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他并没有这么做，于是她笑了起来。起初更像是咳嗽，就像她想忍住喷嚏，然后很快变成一阵漫长持久的嬉笑。她靠在床沿上，双手在面前摇晃着，就好像要让自己停下来，但是这招不管用。然后终于爆发成震耳欲聋的大笑，走廊里的护士不由探头进来问：“屋里究竟是怎么回事？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The doctor looks as if there was never a seminar on how to deal with this type of situation, so in the end he clears his throat loudly and sort of brings his foot down with a quick stamping motion, in order to remind them of his authority, so to speak. It doesn't do much good, of course, but after many more attempts, Parvaneh gets herself into order enough to manage to say: "Ove's heart is too big; I think I'm going to die."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="看来医生从没有在课堂上学过如何应付这样的情况，最后他只好大声咳嗽一下，同时飞快跺了跺脚，来提示他的权威性。当然，成效甚微，在多次尝试之后，帕尔瓦娜终于自控到可以说话的程度，她说：“欧维的心脏太大，笑死我了！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Four days later Ove limps through the snow to his house. He's supported on one side by Parvaneh and on the other by Patrick. One is on crutches and the other knocked up; that's the support you get, he thinks. But he doesn't say it; Parvaneh just had a tantrum when Ove wouldn't let her back the Saab down between the houses a few minutes ago. "I KNOW, OVE! Okay! I KNOW! If you say it one more time I swear to God I'll set fire to your bloody sign!" she shouted at him. Which Ove felt was a little overly dramatic, to say the least.</div>
