<div class="line_en">I don't think I have any words in which to tell the meeting of the mother and daughters. Such hours are beautiful to live, but very hard to describe, so I will leave it to the imagination of my readers, merely saying that the house was full of genuine happiness, and that Meg's tender hope was realized, for when Beth woke from that long, healing sleep, the first objects on which her eyes fell were the little rose and Mother's face. Too weak to wonder at anything, she only smiled and nestled close in the loving arms about her, feeling that the hungry longing was satisfied at last. Then she slept again, and the girls waited upon their mother, for she would not unclasp the thin hand which clung to hers even in sleep.</div>

<div class="line_en">Laurie meanwhile posted off to comfort Amy, and told his story so well that Aunt March actually 'sniffed' herself, and never once said "I told you so". Amy came out so strong on this occasion that I think the good thoughts in the little chapel really began to bear fruit. She dried her tears quickly, restrained her impatience to see her mother, and never even thought of the turquoise ring, when the old lady heartily agreed in Laurie's opinion, that she behaved 'like a capital little woman'. Even Polly seemed impressed, for he called her a good girl, blessed her buttons, and begged her to "come and take a walk, dear", in his most affable tone. She would very gladly have gone out to enjoy the bright wintry weather, but discovering that Laurie was dropping with sleep in spite of manful efforts to conceal the fact, she persuaded him to rest on the sofa, while she wrote a note to her mother. She was a long time about it, and when she returned, he was stretched out with both arms under his head, sound asleep, while Aunt March had pulled down the curtains and sat doing nothing in an unusual fit of benignity.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="同时劳里匆匆赶去安慰艾美，他讲故事讲得十分成功，马奇婶婶听了竟“从鼻子里头笑了一声”，而且没有再说“我早就告诉过你”。艾美这回显得十分坚强，看来她在小教堂里下的功夫开始开花结果了。她很快就把泪水擦干，按捺住要见母亲的急切心情，当劳里说她表现得“像个卓尔不凡的小妇人”，而老太太也由衷地表示赞同时，她竟没有想到那个绿松石戒指，甚至鹦哥也似乎对她大加赞赏，因为它叫她‘好姑娘’，请上帝保佑她，并用极其友好的声调求她“来散个步，亲爱的”。她本来很想出去高高兴兴地在阳光明媚的雪地里玩个痛快，但发现劳里尽管男子气地装着没什么，但他的身子困得直往下倒，便劝他在沙发上躺躺，自己则给母亲写封信。过了好一会她才把信写完，等她再次来到劳里身边时，劳里头枕双臂，直挺挺地睡得十分香甜。马奇婶婶拉下了窗帘，闲坐在一边，脸上露出一种罕有的慈祥宽厚的神情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">What a strange yet pleasant day that was. So brilliant and gay without, for all the world seemed abroad to welcome the first snow. So quiet and reposeful within, for everyone slept, spent with watching, and a Sabbath stillness reigned through the house, while nodding Hannah mounted guard at the door. With a blissful sense of burdens lifted off, Meg and Jo closed their weary eyes, and lay at rest, like storm-beaten boats safe at anchor in a quiet harbor. Mrs. March would not leave Beth's side, but rested in the big chair, waking often to look at, touch, and brood over her child, like a miser over some recovered treasure.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这一天是多么奇特，多么喜气洋洋！屋外阳光灿烂，到处洋溢着欢声笑语，人们似乎全都走了出来，迎接这场初雪；屋里却无声无息，一片宁静，大家因一夜未眠，此刻全都进入了梦乡，屋子里静得连针尖落地的声音也能听到。罕娜打着瞌睡在门边守护，梅格和乔仿佛卸下了一身重担，也都双双合上疲倦的眼睛躺下来休息，就像两只小船，经过风吹浪打后，终于安全泊进了平静的港湾。马奇太太不愿离开贝思身边，便坐在大椅子上休息，不时醒来看一看、摸一摸自己的孩子，看着贝思发一会儿呆，其神态就像一个重新找回了自己财宝的吝啬鬼。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After a while, they began to think he was not going to wake up till night, and I'm not sure that he would, had he not been effectually roused by Amy's cry of joy at sight of her mother. There probably were a good many happy little girls in and about the city that day, but it is my private opinion that Amy was the happiest of all, when she sat in her mother's lap and told her trials, receiving consolation and compensation in the shape of approving smiles and fond caresses. They were alone together in the chapel, to which her mother did not object when its purpose was explained to her.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes, Mother, and when I go home I mean to have a corner in the big closet to put my books and the copy of that picture which I've tried to make. The woman's face is not good, it's too beautiful for me to draw, but the baby is done better, and I love it very much. I like to think He was a little child once, for then I don't seem so far away, and that helps me."</div>

There are a good many hard times in this life of ours, but we can always bear them if we ask help in the right way. I think my little girl is learning this."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“相反。我很喜欢它呢，亲爱的。”她把眼光从沾满灰尘的念珠移到翻得卷了毛边的小册子和点缀着长青树花环的漂亮图画上。”当我们身处逆境，烦恼悲伤时，能找个地方清静一下是件大好事。人生的道路充满了坎坷，但只要我们正确寻求帮助，就能克服困难。我想我的小女儿正在领悟这个道理呢。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“它们很浇亮，不过我认为你年龄尚小，不大适宜戴这种饰物，艾美。”马奇太太看着那只胖嘟嘟的小手，它的食指上戴着一圈天蓝色宝石和一个由两个金色小箍扣在一起组成的古怪护圈。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As Amy pointed to the smiling Christ child on his Mother's knee, Mrs. March saw something on the lifted hand that made her smile. She said nothing, but Amy understood the look, and after a minute's pause, she added gravely, "I wanted to speak to you about this, but I forgot it. Aunt gave me the ring today. She called me to her and kissed me, and put it on my finger, and said I was a credit to her, and she'd like to keep me always. She gave that funny guard to keep the turquoise on, as it's too big.

<div class="line_cn" title="艾美指指笑着坐在圣母膝上的圣婴，马奇太太看到她举着的手戴着一样东西，不觉微微一笑。她没有说什么，但艾美明白了她的眼神，迟疑了一会后，她郑重其事地说：“我原来要把这事告诉你的，但一时忘了。婶婶今天把这个戒指送给我；她叫我走到她跟前。吻了我一下，把它戴在我的手指上，说我替她增了光，她愿意把我永远留在身边。因为绿松石戒指太大，她便把这有趣的护圈给我戴上。我想戴着它们，妈妈，可以吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I've thought a great deal lately about my 'bundle of naughties', and being selfish is the largest one in it, so I'm going to try hard to cure it, if I can. Beth isn't selfish, and that's the reason everyone loves her and feels so bad at the thoughts of losing her. People wouldn't feel so bad about me if I was sick, and I don't deserve to have them, but I'd like to be loved and missed by a great many friends, so I'm going to try and be like Beth all I can.

<div class="line_en">"Mercy me! I don't know anything about love and such nonsense!" cried Jo, with a funny mixture of interest and contempt. "In novels, the girls show it by starting and blushing, fainting away, growing thin, and acting like fools. Now Meg does not do anything of the sort. She eats and drinks and sleeps like a sensible creature, she looks straight in my face when I talk about that man, and only blushes a little bit when Teddy jokes about lovers. I forbid him to do it, but he doesn't mind me as he ought."</div>

<div class="line_en">"I understand, Mother, and quite agree, but I'm disappointed about Meg, for I'd planned to have her marry Teddy by-and-by and sit in the lap of luxury all her days. Wouldn't it be nice?" asked Jo, looking up with a brighter face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我明白，妈妈，也很赞同，但我可以说对梅格十分失望，我一向计划让她日后嫁给特迪，一生享尽荣华富贵。那不好吗？”乔仰头问道。脸色明朗了一点。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Money is a good and useful thing, Jo, and I hope my girls will never feel the need of it too bitterly, nor be tempted by too much. I should like to know that John was firmly established in some good business, which gave him an income large enough to keep free from debt and make Meg comfortable. I'm not ambitious for a splendid fortune, a fashionable position, or a great name for my girls. If rank and money come with love and virtue, also, I should accept them gratefully, and enjoy your good fortune, but I know, by experience, how much genuine happiness can be had in a plain little house, where the daily bread is earned, and some privations give sweetness to the few pleasures. I am content to see Meg begin humbly, for if I am not mistaken, she will be rich in the possession of a good man's heart, and that is better than a fortune."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“金钱是一种很有用处的好东西，乔，我不希望我的女儿穷困潦倒，也不希望她们过于受金钱的诱惑。我希望约翰有份稳定的好职业，其收入足以维持家庭开支，使梅格生活舒适。我并不奢求我的女儿嫁入名门望族，大富大贵。如果地位和金钱是建立在爱情和品行的基础上，我感激地接受，并分享你们的幸福；但根据经验，我知道普通的小户人家虽然每天都要为生活操劳，却可以拥有真正的幸福，他们的生活虽然清贫，却不失甜蜜温馨。看到梅格从低微起步，我也心满意足，如果我没有看错的话，约翰是个好男人，她将因拥有他的心而变得富有，而这比金钱更为宝贵。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Only a little, he's old for his age, and tall, and can be quite grown-up in his manners if he likes. Then he's rich and generous and good, and loves us all, and I say it's a pity my plan is spoiled."</div>
