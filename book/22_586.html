<div class="line_en">I look at Sue: at her hand, at the mark of my mouth upon it. I look at the pillows upon my bed, with the dints of our two heads. I look at the flowers in their vase on the table-top, at the fire in my grate. The room is too warm. The room is too warm and yet I am still trembling, as if cold. She sees it. She catches my eye, and nods to the paper in my hand. "Good news, miss?" she asks; and it is as if the letter has worked some trick upon her, too: for her voice seems light to me -- dreadfully light -- and her face seems sharp. She puts away the thimble; but watches, watches. I cannot meet her gaze.</div>

<div class="line_en">Richard is coming. Does she feel it, as I do? She gives no sign. She walks, she sits, as easily as before. She eats her lunch. She takes out my mother's playingcards, begins the patient dealing-out of solitary games. I stand at the glass and, in reflection, see her reach to take a card and place it, turn it, set it upon another, raise up the kings, pull out the aces…</div>

<div class="line_en">"These show your past," she says, "and these your present." Her eyes grow wide. She seems suddenly young to me: for a moment we bend our heads and whisper as I think other, ordinary girls, in ordinary parlours or schools or sculleries, might whisper: Here is a young man, look, on horseback. Here is a journey. Here is the Queen of Diamonds, for wealth -- I have a brooch that is set with brilliants. I think of it now. I think -- as I have, before, though not in many days -- of Sue, breathing proprietorially over the stones, gauging their worth…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这些表示你的过去。”她说道，“这些是你的现在。”她睁大眼睛。她好象忽然间青春焕发了：有一小会儿，我们俩头凑在一起窃窃私语，正如我想象中，那些平常人家的姑娘们，在平常的屋子里，在学校里，在洗碗间里，叽叽咕咕：这个是小伙子，瞧，骑在马上。这是J。这个是方片Q，代表财富——我有一枚镶钻胸针，当时我就想到了它。我想象着——正如以前我曾经想到过的，尽管时日不多——想象着苏，财宝到手后，面对宝石喘着粗气，估量着宝石价值几何…">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I look at my face and think what makes it mine: the certain curve of cheek, the lip too full, too plump, too pink.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我望着镜中自己的脸，思量着，究竟是何人何物，令镜中这副面孔成为我的面孔：那面颊的曲线分明，嘴唇太过丰满，太过鲜艳。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After all, we are not ordinary girls, in an ordinary parlour; and she is interested in my fortune only as she supposes it hers. Her eye grows narrow again. Her voice lifts out of its whisper and is only pert. I move away from her while she sits gathering the deck, turning the cards in her hands and frowning. She has let one fall, and has not seen it: the two of hearts. I place my heel upon it, imagining one of the painted red hearts my own; and I grind it into the carpet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="毕竟，我们都不是平常人家的姑娘，坐在平常人家的客厅中；她仅仅对我的财富感兴趣，因为她觉得那笔财富都是她的。她眼睛又眯起来，声音由轻言细语中忽然拔高，颇粗鲁无礼。她将牌归拢起来拿在手中，翻转着纸牌，蹙着眉头，我从她身边走开。她掉了一张牌，却未察觉：那是红桃二。我将那牌踩在脚跟下，将其中一颗红心当作我自己的心脏，用力将牌碾进地毯里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At last she gathers the pack together and says that if I will shuffle and hold it, and wish, she will study the fall of the cards and tell me my future. She says it, apparently quite without irony; and despite myself I am drawn to her side, and sit, and clumsily mix the cards, and she takes them and lays them down.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后，她将牌收做一处，问我是否愿意洗牌，洗过再许愿，她会根据牌面前后，算出我的未来。我见她此番言语并无讥讽之意，于是在她身边坐下，笨手笨脚地洗了牌，她接过去，将牌摊在桌上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This must be done. This should have been done, before. Richard is coming, and I am overtaken by a sense of duties unmet: a panicking sense that hours, days -- dark, devious fish of time -- have slithered by, uncaptured. I pass a fretful night. Then, when we rise and she comes to dress me, I pluck at the frill on the sleeve of her gown.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这事儿必须照此办理，这事儿早就该做妥帖了。理查德即将到来，我的心被某种前所未有的负重感攫住：分秒，日夜，时光——那漆黑幽暗的时光之鱼——已一晃而过，去不留痕，由此而生一种惊慌失措的情绪。我度过了一个焦躁不安的夜晚。次日，我们起床，她来为我更衣时，我扯扯她衣袖的褶边。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She says she has not. I take, from my press, a velvet gown, and have her try it. She bares her arms unwillingly, steps out of her skirt and turns, in a kind of modesty, away from my eyes. The gown is narrow. I tug at the hooks. I settle the folds of cloth about her hips, then go to my box for a brooch -- that brooch of brilliants -- and pin it carefully over her heart.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她说她没有。我从衣柜里拿出一件天鹅绒裙子，给她试穿。她颇不情愿地脱了旧衣裳，从落地的裙中走出来，转过身，出于腼腆，避开了我的眼睛。那裙子有些瘦。我拽过裙带系好，将她腰线下的裙摆放熨帖，又到珠宝盒里拿了枚胸针——那枚镶钻胸针——小心地别在她心口前。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="玛格丽特进来了，她把苏当成了我。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I have grown used to her, to the life, the warmth, the particularity of her; she has become, not the gullible girl of a villainous plot -- not Suky Tawdry -- but a girl with a history, with hates and likings.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我已渐渐习惯了她，习惯了她的存在，她的温暖，她的个性；她已变成一个有过往、有爱、有恨的姑娘，而不再是阴谋诡计中那个容易轻信的姑娘——那个粗俗不堪的茶壶苏。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Now all at once I see how near to me in face and figure she'll come, and I understand, as if for the first time, what it is that Richard and I mean to do. I place my face against the post of my bed and watch her, gazing at herself in a rising satisfaction, turning a little to the left, a little to the right, brushing the creases from her skirt, settling her flesh more comfortably into the seams of the gown. "If my aunty could see me!" she says, growing pink; and I think, then, of who might be waiting for her, in that dark thieves' den in London: the aunt, the mother or grandmother. I think how restless she must be, as she counts off the lengthening days that keep her little fingersmith on perilous business, far from home. I imagine her, as she waits, taking out some small thing of Sue's -- some sash, some necklace, some bracelet of gaudy charms -- and turning it, over and over, in her hands… She will turn it for ever, though she does not know it yet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此时此刻，我看出她的相貌身形，将与我多么相近，仿佛是第一次，我意识到，我和理查德图谋欲为的究竟是何事。我脸靠在床柱上，望着她，看她愈发地心满意足，身子转过来，转过去，抚平裙上的褶皱，挺胸收腹，以适应裙子的腰身。“要是我姨妈能看到就好了！”她说道，脸上绯红一片。这时我想到，有谁会在伦敦阴暗的贼穴里等待着她：姨妈，母亲，或是祖母。我想，当她的小贼娃远离家园，赶赴危险的营生，她在家度日如年，得多么忐忑。我想象着，她等待苏时，拿出苏的一些小玩意——腰带呀，项链呀，华而不实的手镯呀——翻来覆去，一遍遍地，在手中把玩…虽然她还不知道，但她会一直把它翻来覆去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I think of that; and I am gripped with what I take to be pity. It is hard, painful, surprising: I feel it, and am afraid. Afraid of what my future may cost me. Afraid of that future itself, and of the unfamiliar, ungovernable emotions with which it might be filled.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我想到了这一点，我被我认为是怜悯的东西所困扰。这是艰难的，痛苦的，令人惊讶的：我感觉到了，而且害怕。害怕我的未来会让我付出什么代价。害怕未来本身，害怕它可能充满的陌生、情绪难以控制。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She does not know it. He must not know it, either. He comes that afternoon -- comes, as he used to come, in the days of Agnes: takes my hand, holds my gaze with his, bends to kiss my knuckles. "Miss Lilly," he says, in a tone of caress. He is dressed darkly, neatly; yet carries his daring, his confidence, close and gaudy about him, like swirls of colour or perfume. I feel the heat of his mouth, even through my gloves. Then he turns to Sue, and she makes a curtsey. The stiffbodiced dress is not made for curtseying in, however: the dip is a jagged one, the fringes upon her skirt tumble together and seem to shake. Her colour rises. I see him smile as he notes it. But I see, too, that he marks the gown, and perhaps also the whiteness of her fingers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她并不了解我的感受。他也不了解。他中午到达——做派一如既往，如同阿格尼丝还在的日子：拉起我的手，直视我的眼睛，躬身亲吻我的手。“李小姐，”他以一种欢喜的语调说道。他身着深色衣裳，整洁优雅；浑身上下仍然带着他的狂妄自信，他的亲密态度和浮华艳俗，就好象旋涡中心那一团暗色或香气。尽管戴着手套，我还是感受到他嘴里的热气。然后他转向苏，她行了个屈膝礼。然而，那上装僵硬的衣裳并非为行屈膝礼而缝制：身子一点，几乎是踉跄的，她衣裙上的流苏都颤巍巍的，似乎要摇动。她脸红了。我见他注意到这一点，他笑了。而我也看见，他注意到那裙子，也许还注意到她手指的白皙。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But I feel it too hard, and grow almost queasy. I smile; but the smile stretches tight. Sue tilts her head. Does she suppose me smiling at my own love? The thought makes the smile tighter still, I begin to feel it as an ache about my throat. I avoid her eye, and his. He goes, but makes her step to him and they stand a moment, murmuring at the door. He gives her a coin -- I see the yellow gleam of it -- he puts it into her hand, closes her fingers about it with his own. His nail shows brown against the fresh pink of her palm. She falls in another awkward curtsey.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是我觉得这太难了，我几乎有些动摇。我笑了；而这微笑展开得十分勉强。苏歪着头。她是否以为我在为自己的爱情微笑？这念头令我的笑容更勉强了，我甚至开始感觉到那是一阵喉间的痛楚。我避开她的眼睛，也避开他。他要走，却命她走过去，他们在门口立了片刻，窃窃私语。他给她一枚硬币——我看到那硬币黄色的闪光——他将硬币放在她手上，帮她合上手。他指甲被她粉嫩的手掌衬得发褐。她放低身段，又行了个笨拙的屈膝礼。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now my smile is fixed like the grimace on the face of a corpse. When she turns back, I cannot look at her.

<div class="line_cn" title="这时，我的笑容凝固住，象是僵尸的鬼脸。待她转过身，我不敢看她。我走进卧室，关上房门，扑到床上，脸埋起来。我被笑声控制着，摇撼着——一阵骇人的笑声，这笑声无声息地追逐着我，好似污秽的水——我战栗着，战栗着，最后我镇定下来。">查看中文翻译</div>

Our food comes cold to the table in winter. In summer it comes too warm.</div>

She does not know she is the hinge of all our scheme, the point about which our plot turns; she thinks I am that point. She does not suspect that, in seeming to mock me, Richard mocks her: that after he has turned to her in private, perhaps to smile, perhaps to grimace, he turns to me, and smiles and grimaces in earnest. And where his torturing of Agnes pricked me on to little cruelties of my own, now I am only unnerved. My consciousness of Sue makes me too conscious of myself -- makes me, now reckless, as Richard is sometimes reckless, in the gross performance of our sham passion; now guarded and watchful, hesitating. I will be bold for an hour -- or meek, or coy -- and then, in the final minute of his stay, I will tremble. I will be betrayed by the movement of my own limbs, my blood, my breath.-- I suppose she reads that as love.</div>

<div class="line_en">She puts me into my bed and lies with her arm against mine; but soon she sleeps, and then draws away. I think of the house in which I lie. I think of the room beyond the bed -- its edges, its surfaces. I think I shall not sleep, unless I touch them. I rise, it is cold, but I go quietly from thing to thing -- chimneypiece, dressing-table, carpet, press. Then I come to Sue. I would like to touch her, to be sure that she is there. I dare not.

<div class="line_en">But the days grow warm, and at last comes a day, so close and airless, the heat overpowers him. He spreads his coat upon the ground and sprawls upon it, tilts his hat to shadow his eyes. For a time, then, the afternoon is still and almost pleasant: there is only the calling of frogs in the rushes, the slapping of water, the cries of birds, the occasional passing of boats. I draw the paint across the card in ever finer, ever slower strokes, and almost fall into slumber.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then Richard laughs, and my hand gives a jump. I turn to look at him. He puts his finger to his lip. "See there," he says softly. And he gestures to Sue. She still sits before the upturned boat, but her head has fallen back against the rotten wood and her limbs are spread and loose. A blade of hair, dark at the tip where she has been biting at it, curves to the corner of her mouth. Her eyes are closed, her breaths come evenly. She is quite asleep. The sun slants against her face and shows the point of her chin, her lashes, her darkening freckles. Between the edges of her gloves and the cuffs of her coat are two narrow strips of pinking flesh.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时理查德笑起来，我手一震。我扭过头望着他。他手指放在嘴唇上。“瞧那儿。”他轻轻地说道。说着他朝苏使了个眼色。她仍旧坐在那只倒扣的小船旁，而她的头则耷拉在腐烂的木头上，四肢松散地舒展开来。一绺青丝弯到她嘴角，那发梢儿曾被她咬嚼过，颜色略显深沉。她双目紧闭，呼吸均匀。她在熟睡。阳光斜斜地落在她脸上，印出她下巴的弯儿，睫毛的尖儿，还有她脸上暗色的雀斑点。在她的手套和衣袖之间，露出两道窄窄的粉红肌肤。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Shall I?" He sniffs. "They are not much used to sunlight, where she comes from." He speaks almost fondly, but laughs against the words; then adds in a murmur: "Nor where she's going, I think. Poor bitch -- she might sleep. She has been asleep since I first got her and brought her here, and has not known it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“叫醒她？”他嗤之以鼻。“在她出身的地方，人们都不大习惯晒到太阳，”他言语颇含怜爱，笑容却与那言语并不相称；接着他又轻轻加了一句：“我觉得，在她要去的那个地方也一样。可怜的小娼妇——她还睡得着。从我第一次骗她得手，把她带到这儿，她一直没睡醒过，还蒙在鼓里呢。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sue does not wake, but frowns and turns her head. Her lower lip slightly falls. The blade of hair swings from her cheek, but keeps its curve and point. I have lifted my brush and touched it once to my crumbling painting; now I hold it, an inch from the card; and I watch, as she sleeps. Only that. Richard sniffs again, softly curses the heat, the season. Then, as before, I suppose he grows still. I suppose he studies me. I suppose the brush in my fingers drops paint -- for I find it later, black paint upon my blue gown. I do not mark it as it falls, however; and perhaps it is my not marking it, that betrays me. That, or my look.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="苏还没醒来，只是皱皱眉，脑袋动了一下。她嘴唇微微开启，那一绺头发在她面颊旁飘荡着，仍是那个曲线和那一撮发梢尖儿。我本已举起画笔，触到我那蹩脚的画稿；此时，我却在离画稿一寸处定住；我凝视着，她正熟睡。仅此而已。理查德又吸吸鼻子，轻声诅咒着这热气，这季节。而后，如同以往，我以为他会安静下来。我以为他在研究我。我以为我手中的画笔有颜料滴落——因为后来我发觉裙子上有一滴黑色。然而，那颜料滴落时，我并未留意；也许正是我未曾留意，反泄露了我的心事。要不，就是我的表情。">查看中文翻译</div>

He leads me to her, we walk to the house, she takes my cloak, takes my shoes; her cheek is pink, after all: she stands frowning at the glass, moves a hand, lightly, across her face… That is all she does; but I see it, and my heart gives a plunge -- that caving, or dropping, that has so much panic in it, so much darkness, I supposed it fear, or madness. I watch her turn and stretch, walk her random way about the room -- see her make all the careless unstudied gestures I have marked so covetously, so long. Is this desire? How queer that I, of all people, should not know! But I thought desire smaller, neater; I supposed it bound to its own organs as taste is bound to the mouth, vision to the eye.

She is waiting, still waiting. Next day I take her walking to my mother's grave. I sit and gaze at the stone, that I have kept so neat and free from blemish. I should like to smash it with a hammer. I wish -- as I have wished many times -- that my mother were alive, so that I might kill her again. I say to Sue: "Do you know, how it was she died?

She tastes of sleep, slightly sour. Too sour. I part my lips -- to breathe, or to swallow, or perhaps to move away; but in breathing or swallowing or moving I only seem to draw her into my mouth. Her lips part, also. Her tongue comes between them and touches mine. And at that, I shudder, or quiver. For it is like the finding out of something raw, the troubling of a wound, a nerve. She feels me jolt, and draws away -- but slowly, slowly and unwillingly, so that our damp mouths seem to cling together and, as they part, to tear. She holds herself above me. I feel the rapid beating of a heart, and suppose it my own. But it is hers. Her breath comes, fast. She has begun, very lightly, to tremble. Then I catch the excitement of her, the amazement of her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="以前，我曾领略过绅士们平静干燥的嘴印在我戴了手套的手上，我的面颊上。我曾忍受过理查德在我手心留下湿乎乎，曲意逢迎的吻。她嘴唇有些凉，光滑而湿润：印在我唇上，并不完全贴和，却随即变得更温暖更湿润。她头发落在我脸上。我看不分清她的面容，我只能感觉她，感觉她的味道。她气息略有些酸味，那是被窝味。味道太重。我张开嘴——想喘口气，想咽下唾沫，也许还想移开嘴唇；不过喘口气也好，咽下唾沫也好，移开嘴唇也好，我好象只是将她抱得更紧。她嘴唇也张开了。她舌头在唇间流连，与我的纠缠在一起。这吻令我战栗不止。这好似引发了某种刺痛，好似剥开了痂的伤口，好似触动了一根新的神经。她感觉到我的战栗，她缓缓地，缓缓地，并不情愿地退开，我们湿润的嘴唇仿佛粘在一起，当我们嘴唇分开，就如同撕裂开一样。她伏在我身上，我感觉到一阵急速的心跳，我以为那是我的心跳。然而那却是她的。她呼吸也急促起来。她也开始非常细微地颤抖。于是我察觉到她的兴奋，她的激动。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Yet her hand moves slowly, still. She whispers. "How soft you are! How warm! I want --" The hand moves even slower. She begins to press. I catch my breath. That makes her hesitate, and then press harder. At last she presses so hard I feel the giving of my flesh, I feel her inside me. I think I cry out. She does not hesitate now, however, but comes nearer to me and puts her hips about my thigh; then presses again. So slight she is! -- but her hip is sharp, her hand is blunt, she leans, she pushes, she moves her hips and hand as if to a rhythm, a time, a quickening beat. She reaches. She reaches so far, she catches the life, the shuddering heart of me: soon I seem to be nowhere but at the points at which my flesh is gripped by hers. And then, "Oh, there!" she says. "Just there! Oh, there!" -- I am breaking, shattering, bursting out of her hand. She begins to weep. Her tears come upon my face. She puts her mouth to them. You pearl, she says, as she does it. Her voice is broken. You pearl.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她手上动作仍旧轻缓，她在我耳边轻语。“你多么柔软，多温暖！我要——”那支手动作更慢了。她开始用力。我屏住了呼吸。这令她稍事犹豫，随后更加用力。终于，她手中力道令我体会到上天赐予我身体的礼物，我感觉到她在我身体里。我想我叫出声了。这时她没有犹豫，而是靠过来紧贴着我，身体全部压在我身上，手里又开始用力。她是多么轻盈！——而她的#臀#部#浑#圆，她的手#结#实#有#力（blunt），她斜倚着，她推进着，她移动着#臀#部和手，仿佛在应和一种节奏，一个拍子，一阵愈来愈快的鼓点。她触到了。她真的触到了。她抓住了我的生命，我悸动的心：很快，我的。身。体似乎只剩下由她掌握着的那么一点儿。随即，“噢，是这儿！”她说道。“就是这儿！哦！这儿！”我从她手中迸裂爆发，四散开来。她开始抽泣。她的泪珠儿落到我脸上。她吻掉那些泪珠儿。你是珍珠，她边#吻#边#说#道。她声音嘶哑。你是珍珠。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When her hand moves again, her fingers no longer flutter: they have grown wet, and slide, and in sliding seem, like her lips as they rub upon mine, to quicken and draw me, to gather me, out of the darkness, out of my natural shape.

My thigh is wet from where she has leaned and moved upon me. The feathers of the mattress have yielded beneath us, the bed is close and high and hot. She puts back the blanket. The night is still deep, the room still black.
