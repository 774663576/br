<div class="line_en">"You'd think people had better things to gossip about," said Ginny, as she sat on the common-room floor, leaning against Harry's legs and reading the Daily Prophet. Three Dementor attacks in a week, and all Romilda Vane does is ask me if it's true you've got a Hippogriff tattooed across your chest."</div>

<div class="line_en">The fact that Harry Potter was going out with Ginny Weasley seemed to interest a great number of people, most of them girls, yet Harry found himself newly and happily impervious to gossip over the next few weeks. After all, it made a very nice change to be talked about because of something that was making him happier than he could remember being for a very long time, rather than because he had been involved in horrific scenes of Dark magic.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利·波特和金妮·韦斯莱约会的事好像引起了很多人的兴趣，大多数是女孩子，然而哈利觉得自己这几个星期丝毫没有受到这些闲言碎语的影响，并且心情愉快。毕竟，这是一个很不错的改变，人们谈论的是一件让他感到久违了的快乐事情，比起一天到晚谈论黑魔法的恐怖场面强多了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I told her it's a Hungarian Horntail," said Ginny, turning a page of the newspaper idly. "Much more macho."</div>

<div class="line_en">But Ron's tolerance was not to be tested much as they moved into June, for Harry and Ginny's time together was becoming increasingly restricted. Ginny's O. W. L. s were approaching and she was therefore forced to revise for hours into the night. On one such evening, when Ginny had retired to the library and Harry was sitting beside the window in the common room, supposedly finishing his Herbology homework but in reality reliving a particularly happy hour he had spent down by the lake with Ginny at lunch-time, Hermione dropped into the seat between him and Ron with an unpleasantly purposeful look on her face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="进入六月，罗恩的忍耐没有受到多少考验，因为哈利和金妮在一起的时间越来越有限。金妮的O.W。Ls考试日渐临近，她每晚不得不花好几个小时复习功课。在这样一个晚上，金妮去了图书馆，哈利坐在公共休息室的窗边，本想完成他的草药课家庭作业，但事实上他正在重温午饭时与金妮在湖边度过的一段非常愉快的时光。这时赫敏挤进了他和罗恩中间的座位，脸上是一种很坚决的表情，让人看了很不舒服。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He had not dared to return to the Room of Requirement to retrieve his book, and his performance in Potions was suffer-ing accordingly (though Slughorn, who approved of Ginny, had jocularly attributed this to Harry being lovesick). But Harry was sure that Snape had not yet given up hope of laying hands on the Prince's book, and was determined to leave it where it was while Snape remained on the lookout.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他还没敢返回有求必应屋去拿他的那本书，他的魔药课成绩也因此掉了下来（不过，斯拉格霍恩对金妮很有好感，他诙谐地将哈利的成绩下降归于相思病）。哈利觉得斯内普一定还没有放弃搜查王子的课本，由于斯内普一直在监视他，他决定暂时不去碰那本书。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry picked up the crumbling piece of paper and stared at the moving photograph, yellowed with age; Ron leaned over for a look, too.

Under-neath the photograph was the caption: Eileen Prince, Captain of the Hogwarts Gobstones Team.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我和你相处五年了，怎么可能还认为女孩子不聪明呢？”哈利说，觉得被刺痛了，“是因为他写字的方式，我就是知道这个‘王子’是男的，我判断得出来。跟这女孩子一点儿关系也没有，你是从哪儿弄到这张照片的？”">查看中文翻译</div>

Well, after that, you know, Dumbledore seemed much more disposed to give me a job, and I could not help thinking, Harry, that it was because he appreciated the stark contrast between my own unassuming manners and quiet talent, compared to the pushing, thrusting young man who was prepared to listen at keyholes -- Harry, dear?"</div>
