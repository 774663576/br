<div class="line_en">In her first year at Radcliffe, 1955, Marilyn had enrolled in introductory physics, and her advisor glanced at her course schedule and paused. He was a plump man with a tweed suit and a crimson bowtie, a dark gray hat brim-down on the table beside him. "Why do you want to take physics?" he asked, and she explained shyly that she was hoping to become a doctor. "Not a nurse?" he'd said, with a chuckle. From a folder he pulled her high-school transcript and studied it. "Well," he said. "I see you received very good grades in your high-school physics course." She'd had the highest grade in her class, had set the curve on every test; she had loved physics. But he couldn't know that. On the transcript, it said only "A." She held her breath, waiting, afraid he would tell her that science was too hard, that she'd better try something like English or history instead. In her mind she prepared her retort. Instead he said, "All right, then, why don't you try chemistry -- if you think you can handle it," and signed her course slip and handed it over, just like that.</div>

<div class="line_en">When she arrived at the laboratory, though, she found herself the only girl in a room of fifteen men. The instructor tut-tutted and said, "Miss Walker, you'd better tie up those golden locks." "Can I light the burner for you?" someone else would say. "Let me open that jar for you." When she broke a beaker, the second day of class, three men rushed to her side. "Careful," they said. "Better let us help." Everything, she soon realized, started with better: "Better let me pour that acid for you." "Better stand back -- this will make a pop." By the third day of class, she decided to show them. She said no, thank you, when people offered to make her pipettes, then hid a grin as they watched her melt glass tubes over the Bunsen burner and stretch them, like taffy, into perfectly tapered droppers. While her classmates sometimes splashed their lab coats, burning holes all the way down through their suits, she measured acids with steady hands. Her solutions never bubbled onto the counter like baking-soda volcanoes. Her results were the most accurate; her lab reports the most complete. By midterm, she set the curve for every exam, and the instructor had stopped smirking.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I'm sorry," he said. "We can't make an exception for anyone, or everyone will expect it." At the look on Marilyn's face, he reached across the desk and patted her hand. "Some of the equipment in the shop would be difficult for you to use," he told her. "And to be honest, Miss Walker, having a girl like you in the classroom would be very distracting to the boys in the class." He meant it as a compliment, she knew. But she also knew that it wasn't. She smiled and thanked him for his time. It wasn't a true smile, and her dimples didn't show.</div>

<div class="line_en">She had always liked surprising people that way. In high school, she had approached her principal with a request: to take shop instead of home ec. It was 1952, and in Boston, researchers were just beginning to develop a pill that would change women's lives forever -- but girls still wore skirts to school, and in Virginia, her request had been radical. Home economics was required for every sophomore girl, and Marilyn's mother, Doris Walker, was the only home ec teacher at Patrick Henry Senior High. Marilyn had asked to switch into shop with the sophomore boys. It was the same class period, she pointed out. Her schedule wouldn't be disrupted. Mr. Tolliver, the principal, knew her well; she had been at the top of her class -- girls and boys -- since the sixth grade, and her mother had taught at the school for years. So he nodded and smiled as she made her case. Then he shook his head.</div>

<div class="line_en">Keeping house, she had thought. Each day she watched her classmates, clumsy in thimbled fingers, sucking the ends of thread, squinting for the needle's eye. She thought of her mother's insistence on changing clothes before dinner, though there was no longer a husband to impress with her fresh face and crisp housedress. It was after her father left that her mother had begun to teach. Marilyn had been three. Her clearest memory of her father was a feel and a smell: the bristle of his cheek against hers as he lifted her up, and the tingle of Old Spice in her nostrils. She didn't remember his leaving but knew it had happened. Everyone did. And now, everyone had more or less forgotten it. Newcomers to the school district assumed Mrs. Walker was a widow. Her mother herself never mentioned it. She still powdered her nose after cooking and before eating; she still put on lipstick before coming downstairs to make breakfast. So they called it keeping house for a reason, Marilyn thought. Sometimes it did run away. And in English class, on a test, she wrote, Irony: a contradictory outcome of events as if in mockery of the promise and fitness of things, and received an A.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="管理住宅，她想。每天她都会看到同学们戴着顶针，动作笨拙地咂湿线头，眯着眼睛把它穿进针眼里去。她想起她母亲每次吃饭之前都要换衣服，尽管她无需用光鲜的皮肤和整洁的家居服取悦丈夫——她的母亲是在丈夫离开之后才开始教家政课的。那时玛丽琳才三岁，她只在触觉和嗅觉方面仍对父亲有些还算清晰的印象：父亲抱起她时，他的胡茬扎着她的脸颊，一股“老辣椒”牌须后水的浓烈味道随之钻进她的鼻孔。她不记得他是怎么离开的，但知道这件事发生了。每个人都知道。而现在，每个人又似乎或多或少地忘记了这件事，以至于新搬来学区的人会以为沃克尔夫人是寡妇。对于此事，她母亲本人则从来不提，她依旧会在做饭之后和用餐之前补妆，在下楼做早饭之前涂上唇膏。所以，所谓的“管理住宅”是有道理的，玛丽琳想，因为，有时候，房子真的会跑掉。在英文课的一次测验中，她写道：“反讽——对事物的预期和现实结果之间的矛盾的嘲弄。”结果得了“A”。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So she had slouched in the back row of the home ec classroom, waiting out the first-day welcome speech her mother had given for a dozen years, drumming her fingers as her mother promised to teach them everything a young lady needed to keep a house. As if, Marilyn thought, it might run away when you weren't looking. She studied the other girls in her class, noting who bit her nails, whose sweater was pilled, who smelled faintly of a cigarette snuck over lunch. Across the hall, she could see Mr. Landis, the shop teacher, demonstrating the correct way to hold a hammer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是，她只好无精打采地坐在教室后排，等着听她母亲发表十二年来重复过无数次的“欢迎学习家政课”的演讲。“每一位年轻女士，都需要管理住宅。”母亲向学生们保证道。这时候的玛丽琳正在玩手指头，她心想：说得好像如果你不看着家里的房子，它就会跑掉一样。她观察着家政课上的其他女孩，有的在咬指甲，有的身上穿的毛衣起了球，有的闻起来像是在午餐时偷偷抽过烟。她能看到走廊对面的教室里，手工课老师兰蒂斯先生正在演示如何使用锤子。">查看中文翻译</div>

After the last dish was washed, her mother rinsed her hands and applied a dab of lotion from the bottle on the counter. Then she came to the table, brushed Marilyn's hair from her face, and kissed her forehead. Her hands smelled like lemons. Her lips were dry and warm.</div>

One day she left her iron facedown on the board, causing not only a blackened burn in the cover but enough smoke to set off the fire sprinklers.

<div class="line_en">It would bother Marilyn, for the rest of her life, that her mother had been right. She worked her way through chemistry, majored in physics, ticked the requirements for medical school off her list. Late at night, bent over her textbooks while her roommate wound curlers into her hair and patted cold cream onto her cheeks and went to bed, Marilyn sipped double-strength tea and kept awake by picturing herself in a white doctor's coat, laying a cool hand against a feverish forehead, touching a stethoscope to a patient's chest. It was the furthest thing she could imagine from her mother's life, where sewing a neat hem was a laudable accomplishment and removing beet stains from a blouse was cause for celebration. Instead she would blunt pain and stanch bleeding and set bones. She would save lives. Yet in the end it happened just as her mother predicted: she met a man.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她母亲说得没错，但这让玛丽琳在往后的日子里一直觉得困扰。她从头开始学化学，主修物理，做好了向医学院进军的准备。每天晚上，她的室友别好卷发夹涂上冷霜去睡觉时，玛丽琳却在埋头苦读。她困了就喝浓茶，或者想象自己穿着医生的白大褂，把手放在发烧的病人额头，戴着听诊器为他们诊断的样子，以此来提神。做医生是她想象得到的最能与母亲的生活方式拉开距离的职业。以家政课老师的标准，把一道褶边缝得整齐利落就是了不起的成就，洗掉衬衫上的甜菜汁也算得上值得庆祝的理由。而作为医生，她的工作是止血止痛、修皮整骨、挽救生命。不过，她母亲的预测也是正确的——她遇到了一个男人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For the rest of her life, this would be what Marilyn thought of first when she thought of her mother. Her mother, who had never left her hometown eighty miles from Charlottesville, who always wore gloves outside the house, and who never, in all the years Marilyn could remember, sent her to school without a hot breakfast. Who never mentioned Marilyn's father after he left, but raised her alone. Who, when Marilyn earned a scholarship to Radcliffe, hugged her for a long time and whispered, "How proud I am of you. You have no idea." And then, when she loosened her arms, looked into Marilyn's face and tucked her hair behind her ears and said, "You know, you'll meet a lot of wonderful Harvard men."</div>

<div class="line_en">It was September 1957, her junior year, at the back of a crowded lecture hall. Cambridge was still sweltering and sticky, and everyone was waiting for the crisp cool of fall to sweep the city clean. The course was new that year --"The Cowboy in American Culture"-- and everyone wanted to take it: rumor had it that their homework would be watching The Lone Ranger and Gunsmoke on television. Marilyn took a piece of loose-leaf from her folder and, while her head was bent, quiet fell over the room like snow. She glanced up at the professor approaching the podium, and then she understood why everyone had gone silent.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="1957年9月，玛丽琳上大三。一天，她坐在拥挤的讲堂后排听课。剑桥的天气依旧潮湿闷热，大家对凉爽的秋天翘首以待。这堂课是当年新开的——“美国文化中的牛仔”——每个人都想选。据说，课后作业是观赏影视作品《西部独行侠》和《荒野大镖客》。玛丽琳从资料夹中拿出一张活页纸。就在她低头忙碌时，教室里突然变得像雪地一样安静，她抬眼看到这门课的教授走近讲台，立刻明白了大家安静下来的原因。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The course catalog had listed the instructor as James P. Lee. He was a fourth-year graduate student and no one knew anything about him. To Marilyn, who had spent all her years in Virginia, Lee conjured a certain kind of man: a Richard Henry, a Robert E. Now she realized that she -- that everyone -- had expected someone in a sand-colored blazer, someone with a slight drawl and a Southern pedigree. The man setting his papers on the lectern was youngish and thin, but that was as close as he came to what they all had pictured. An Oriental, she thought. She had never seen one in person before. He was dressed like an undertaker: black suit, black tie knotted tight, shirt so white it glowed. His hair was slicked back and parted in a perfect pale line, but one wisp stood straight up in back, like an Indian chief's feather. As he started to speak, he reached up with one hand to smooth down the cowlick, and someone snickered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="课程目录上写着授课人的名字“詹姆斯·P。 李”。他看起来就像个大四学生，但没人跟他熟识。玛丽琳从小在弗吉尼亚长大，“李”这个姓会让她联想到特定类型的男人，比如理查德·亨利·李、罗伯特·E。 李，所以，她意识到自己和大家一样，以为这个“詹姆斯·P。 李”会身穿浅棕色夹克，操着慢条斯理的南方口音。而眼前这个把讲义放在讲台上的人，却非常青涩瘦削，不过，仅凭年龄还不至于让他们如此震惊。一个东方人，她想。她之前从未亲眼见过东方人。他打扮得像个送葬的，一身黑西装，黑领带系得很紧，衬衫白得耀眼，头发向后梳，整齐地一分为二，但后面有一撮顽强地直竖着，如同印第安酋长头上戴的羽毛。开口讲话时，他伸出一只手，想把那撮头发抿回去，下面有学生偷偷笑起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">If Professor Lee heard, he didn't show it. "Good afternoon," he said. Marilyn found herself holding her breath as he wrote his name on the board. She could see him through her classmates' eyes, and she knew what they were thinking. This was their professor? This little man, five foot nine at most and not even American, was going to teach them about cowboys? But when she studied him again, she noticed how slender his neck was, how smooth his cheeks. He looked like a little boy playing dress-up, and she closed her eyes and prayed for the class to go well. The silence stretched, taut as the surface of a bubble, ready to be popped. Someone shoved a sheaf of mimeographed syllabi over her shoulder, and she jumped.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不知道李教授是否听到了学生的窃笑，反正他并没有被打断。“下午好。”他说。玛丽琳意识到，他在黑板上写下名字时，她不自觉地屏住了呼吸。从同学们的神情中，她能看出他们在想什么。这就是我们的教授？这个小个子，身高至多不过五英尺九英寸，甚至连美国人都不是，竟然要给他们讲牛仔的历史？不过，再次打量他的时候，玛丽琳注意到他的脖颈细长、脸颊光滑，看起来像个穿着大人衣服的小男孩。她闭上眼睛，祈祷这门课能够顺利进行。教室里的寂静还在蔓延，如同不断扩张的气泡表面，随时都会破裂。身后的人突然传给她一叠油印的讲义，她吓得跳了起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The image of the cowboy," he said, "has existed longer than we might imagine." There was no trace of an accent in his voice, and she slowly let out her breath. Where had he come from, she wondered. He sounded nothing like what she'd been told Chinamen sounded like: so solly, no washee. Had he grown up in America? Ten minutes in, the room began to rustle and murmur. Marilyn glanced at the notes she'd jotted down: phrases like "undergone multiple evolutions in each era of American history" and "apparent dichotomy between social rebel and embodiment of quintessential American values." She scanned the syllabus. Ten required books, a midterm exam, three essays. This wasn't what her classmates had had in mind. A girl at the side of the room tucked her book beneath her arm and slipped out the door. Two girls from the next row followed. After that it was a slow but steady trickle. Every minute or two another few students left. One boy from the first row stood up and cut right in front of the podium on his way out. The last to leave were three boys from the back. They whispered and sniggered as they edged past just-emptied seats, their thighs bumping each armrest with a soft thump, thump, thump. As the door closed behind them, Marilyn heard one shout "Yippee-ki-yay-ay!" so loud that he drowned out the lecture. Only nine other students still remained, all studiously bent over notebooks, but they were all reddening in the cheeks and at the edges of their ears. Her own face was hot and she didn't dare look at Professor Lee. Instead she turned her face to her notes and put her hand to her forehead, as if shielding her eyes from the sun.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“牛仔的形象，”他说，“出现得比我们想象的早得多。”他的英文听不出口音，这让玛丽琳如释重负，一颗提起的心缓缓放下。她很想知道他是从哪儿来的，因为她曾经听说，中国人说英文都是这样的：“so solly， no washee。 ”他是在美国长大的吗？过了不到十分钟，学生们就开始做小动作和窃窃私语。玛丽琳瞥了一眼自己记下的要点，比如“在美国历史的各个阶段经历过多次演化”“社会反叛者与典型的美国价值观之间的明显分歧”什么的。她又浏览了一遍讲义，发现要读十本书、进行一次期中考试、写三篇论文，但是，其他同学并不关心这些，坐在教室边上的一个女生把书夹在腋下，偷偷溜出门外，旁边一排的两个女生紧随其后。接着，教室里的人数逐渐在减少，每隔一两分钟都会有人离开，第一排的一个男生甚至直接穿过讲台，大摇大摆地走掉了。最后走的是后排的三个男生，他们交头接耳，一边窃笑一边贴着已经空出来的整排座位挪了出去。他们的大腿碰在扶手上，发出低沉的“砰”“砰”“砰”的声音。等到门一关，玛丽琳就听到外面传来“耶——耶——”的欢呼声，声音很大，盖过了讲课的声音。现在，教室里只剩下九个学生，虽然他们都专注地趴在笔记本上，但脸颊和耳廓明显发红。玛丽琳觉得自己的脸火辣辣的，她不敢看李教授，只能盯着笔记，一只手扶着额头，似乎在遮挡阳光。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="李教授收拾好讲义离开了教室，就在这时，玛丽琳感到脖子后面一阵刺痛，正是这种感觉驱使她去了李教授的办公室。历史系的办公区如同图书馆般安静，空气中透着凉意，弥漫着少量细微的尘埃。李教授坐在办公桌前，头靠在墙上，正在读当天早晨的哈佛校报《哈佛克里姆森报》。他的头路不那么明显了，后面的那一撮重又竖了起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

He didn't seem to notice that his voice now echoed in the nearly empty hall. He finished his lecture with five minutes remaining in the period and said, "I'll hold office hours until three o'clock." For just a few seconds, he stared straight ahead, toward a distant horizon, and she squirmed in her seat as if he were staring directly at her.</div>

<div class="line_en">On Thursday, at the next lecture, Marilyn sat off to the side. When Professor Lee came into the room, she didn't look up. Instead she wrote the date carefully in the corner of her notes, looping a demure S in September, crossing the t in a perfectly horizontal line. As he began to speak, her cheeks went hot, as if she'd stepped into summer sun. She was positive she was bright red, blazing like a lighthouse, but when she finally looked around, out of the corners of her eyes, everyone was focused on the lecture. There were a handful of other students in the room, but they were scribbling in their notebooks or facing the podium up front. No one noticed her at all.</div>

<div class="line_en">When she'd kissed him, she had surprised herself. It had been such an impulse -- the way she sometimes reached out to catch a stray leaf on the wind, or jumped a puddle on a rainy day -- something done without thinking or resisting, something pointless and harmless. She had never done anything like that before and never would again, and looking back on it, she would forever be surprised at herself, and a little shocked. But at that moment she had known, with a certainty she would never feel about anything else in her life, that it was right, that she wanted this man in her life.

<div class="line_en">The touch of his lips on hers had startled her. He had tasted like coffee, warm and slightly bitter, and he had kissed back. That had startled her, too. As if he were ready for it, as if it were as much his idea as hers. After they finally drew apart, she'd been too embarrassed to meet his eyes. Instead she looked down into her lap, studying the soft plaid flannel of her skirt. Sweat bunched her slip to her thighs. In a moment she grew braver and peeked at him through the curtain of her hair. He looked shyly up at her then, through his lashes, and she saw that he wasn't angry, that his cheeks were pink. "Perhaps we'd better go somewhere else," he said, and she'd nodded and picked up her bag.</div>

<div class="line_en">They'd walked down along the river, passing the redbrick dorms in silence. The crew team had been practicing, the oarsmen bending and unbending over their oars in perfect unison, the boat sliding across the water without sound. Marilyn knew these men: they asked her to mixers, to movies, to football games; they all looked alike, the same blend of sandy hair and ruddy skin she'd seen all through high school, all her life -- as familiar as boiled potatoes. When she turned them down to finish a paper or catch up on her reading, they moved on to woo other girls down the hall. From where she stood on the riverbank, the distance made them anonymous, expressionless as dolls. Then she and James -- as she did not even dare, yet, to think of him -- had reached the footbridge, and she stopped and turned to face him. He hadn't looked like a professor, but like a teenage boy, bashful and eager, reaching out to take her hand.</div>

He had looked right at her, over and over, as he held forth on Roy Rogers and Gene Autry and John Wayne, but when she came to his office he had not even recognized her. Hers had been just one of the pale, pretty faces, indistinguishable from the next, and though he would never fully realize it, this was the first reason he came to love her: because she had blended in so perfectly, because she had seemed so completely and utterly at home.</div>

<div class="line_en">All through the second lecture, Marilyn remembered the smell of his skin -- clean and sharp, like the air after a rainstorm -- and the feel of his hands at her waist, and even her palms grew warm. Through her fingers, she watched him: the tip of his ballpoint tapping the top of the podium, the deliberate flick as he turned over another page of his notes. He looked everywhere but toward her, she realized. At the end of the hour, she dawdled in her seat, slowly slipping her papers into her folder, tucking her pencil into the pocket. Her classmates, hurrying to other courses, squeezed past her into the aisle, jostling her with their bags. At the podium, James sorted his notes, dusted his hands, replaced the chalk on the blackboard ledge. He didn't look up when she stacked her books, or when she tucked them in the curve of her arm and headed toward the door. Then, just as her hand touched the knob, he called, "A moment, Miss Walker," and something inside her jumped.</div>

<div class="line_en">They spent all autumn together. James had a seriousness, a reserve, unlike anyone she had met before. He seemed to look at things more closely, to think more carefully, to hold himself a half step apart. Only when they came together, in his tiny Cambridge apartment, did that reserve drop, with a fierceness that made her catch her breath. Afterward, curled up on his bed, Marilyn ruffled his hair, spiky with sweat. For those afternoon hours, he seemed at ease with himself, and she loved that she was the only thing that made him feel that way. They would lie together, dozing and dreaming, until six o'clock. Then Marilyn slipped her dress back over her head, and James buttoned his shirt and combed his hair again. His cowlick would stand up at the back, but she never told him, loving that little reminder of the side only she got to see. She simply kissed him and hurried back for evening sign-in at the dormitory. James himself began to forget about the cowlick; after Marilyn left, he seldom remembered to look in the mirror. Every time she kissed him, every time he opened his arms and she crawled into them, felt like a miracle. Coming to her made him feel perfectly welcomed, perfectly at home, as he had never in his life felt before.</div>

<div class="line_en">He had never felt he belonged here, even though he'd been born on American soil, even though he had never set foot anywhere else. His father had come to California under a false name, pretending to be the son of a neighbor who had emigrated there some years earlier. America was a melting pot, but Congress, terrified that the molten mixture was becoming a shade too yellow, had banned all immigrants from China. Only the children of those already in the States could enter. So James's father had taken the name of his neighbor's son, who had drowned in the river the year before, and come to join his "father" in San Francisco. It was the story of nearly every Chinese immigrant from the time of Chester A. Arthur to the end of the Second World War. While the Irish and the Germans and the Swedes crowded onto steamship decks, waving as the pale green torch of the Statue of Liberty came into view, the coolies had to find other means to reach the land where all men were created equal. Those who made it would visit their wives in China and return each time celebrating the birth of a son. Those at home in the villages who longed to make their fortunes would adopt the names of those mythical sons and make the long journey across the sea. While the Norwegians and the Italians and the Russian Jews ferried from Ellis Island to Manhattan, fanning out by road and railway to Kansas and Nebraska and Minnesota, the Chinese who bluffed their way to California mostly stayed put. In Chinatowns, the lives of all those paper sons were fragile and easily torn. Everyone's name was false. Everyone hoped not to be found out and sent back. Everyone clustered together so they wouldn't stand out.</div>

In 1938, when James was six, his father received a letter from a paper brother who had gone east looking for work when the Depression began. He had found a place at a small boarding school in Iowa, the "brother" wrote, doing groundswork and maintenance. Now his (real, nonpaper) mother was ill and he was returning to China, and his employers wondered if he had any reliable friends who might do as good a job.

A man with a large white mustache like cotton brought him into an empty classroom and gave him a booklet and a yellow pencil.

Surely not a janitor's son, or a cafeteria lady's son, or a groundskeeper's son. If a square playing field is forty feet on a side, how long is the fence that goes around it? When was America discovered? Which of these words is a noun? Here is a sequence of shapes; which shape completes the pattern? We're sorry, the principal could say. Your son didn't pass the test.

<div class="line_en">When the term began in September, he rode in to school with his father in the Ford truck the school had lent him for his maintenance work. "You're the first Oriental boy to attend Lloyd," his father reminded him. "Set a good example." That first morning, James slid into his seat and the girl next to him asked, "What's wrong with your eyes?" It wasn't until he heard the horror in the teacher's voice --"Shirley Byron!"-- that he realized he was supposed to be embarrassed; the next time it happened, he had learned his lesson and turned red right away. In every class, every day that first week, the other students studied him: where had he come from, this boy? He had a bookbag, a Lloyd uniform. Yet he didn't live at the school like the rest of them; he looked like no one they'd ever seen. Now and then, his father would be called in to loosen a squeaky window, replace a lightbulb, mop up a spill. James, scrunched in the back row, saw his classmates glance from his father to him and knew that they suspected. He would bend his head over his book, so close that his nose nearly touched the page, until his father left the room. By the second month, he asked his parents for permission to walk to and from school by himself. Alone, he could pretend to be just another student. He could pretend that, in the uniform, he looked just like everyone else.</div>

<div class="line_en">He spent twelve years at Lloyd and never felt at home. At Lloyd, everyone seemed to be descended from a Pilgrim or a senator or a Rockefeller, but when they did family tree projects in class, he pretended to forget the assignment rather than draw his own complicated diagram. Don't ask any questions, he prayed silently as the teacher marked a small red zero beside his name. He set himself a curriculum of studying American culture -- listening to the radio, reading comics, saving his pocket money for double features, learning the rules of the new board games -- in case anyone ever said, Hey, didya hear Red Skelton yesterday? or Wanna play Monopoly? though no one ever did. As he got older, he did not attend the dances, or the pep rallies, or the junior or senior proms. At best, girls smiled silently at him in the hallways; at worst, they stared as he passed, and he heard their snickers as he turned the corner. At graduation, the yearbook ran one photo of him besides the obligatory senior portrait: a shot of him at an assembly to greet President Truman, his head visible over the shoulder of the class treasurer and a girl who would go on to marry a Belgian prince. His ears, blushing pink in real life, were a deep and unnatural gray in the photograph, his mouth slightly open, as if he had been caught trespassing. At college, he hoped things would be different. Yet after seven years at Harvard -- four as an undergrad, three and counting as a graduate student -- nothing had changed. Without realizing why, he studied the most quintessentially American subject he could find -- cowboys -- but he never spoke of his parents, or his family. He still had few acquaintances and no friends. He still found himself shifting in his seat, as if at any moment someone might notice him and ask him to leave.</div>

<div class="line_en">So that fall of 1957, when Marilyn had leaned over his desk and kissed him, this beautiful honey-haired girl, when she came into his arms and then into his bed, James could not quite believe it. The first afternoon they'd spent together, in his tiny whitewashed studio apartment, he marveled at how her body fit so perfectly against his: her nose nestled exactly into the hollow between his collarbones; her cheek curved to match the side of his neck. As if they were two halves of a mold. He had studied her with the air of a sculptor, tracing the contours of her hips and calves, his fingertips grazing her skin. When they made love, her hair came alive. It darkened from golden-wheat to amber. It kinked and curled like a fiddlehead fern. It amazed him that he could have such an effect on anyone. As she dozed in his arms, her hair slowly relaxed, and when she woke, it had stretched back to its usual waves. Then her easy laugh sparkled in that white, bare room; as she chattered, breathless, her hands fluttered until he caught them in his and they lay warm and still, like resting birds, and then she pulled him to her again. It was as if America herself was taking him in. It was too much luck. He feared the day the universe would notice he wasn't supposed to have her and take her away. Or that she might suddenly realize her mistake and disappear from his life as suddenly as she had entered. After a while, the fear became a habit, too.</div>

<div class="line_en">He began to make small changes he thought she might like: he trimmed his hair; he bought a blue-striped Oxford shirt after she admired one on a passerby. (The cowlick, persistent, still stood up; years later, Nath and Hannah would inherit it, too.) One Saturday, at Marilyn's suggestion, he bought two gallons of pale yellow paint, pushed the furniture to the middle of the apartment, and spread drop cloths across the parquet. As they brushed one section, then another, the room brightened like panes of sunlight stretching across the walls. When everything was painted, they opened all the windows and curled up on the bed in the center of the room. The apartment was so small that nothing was more than a few feet from the wall, but surrounded by his desk and chairs, the armchair and the dresser pressed close, he felt as if they were on an island, or afloat in the sea. With Marilyn tucked in the curve of his shoulder, he kissed her and her arms circled his neck, her body rose to meet his. Another tiny miracle, every time.</div>

<div class="line_en">At Thanksgiving, Marilyn decided not to go home to Virginia. She told herself, and James, that it was too far for such a short holiday, but in reality she knew her mother would ask her, again, if she had any prospects, and this time she did not know how to respond. Instead, in James's tiny kitchen, she roasted a chicken, cubed potatoes, peeled yams into a casserole dish the size of a steno pad: Thanksgiving dinner in miniature. James, who had never cooked himself a meal, who subsisted on burgers from Charlie's Kitchen and English muffins from the Hayes-Bickford, watched in awe. After Marilyn basted the chicken, she looked up defiantly, closed the oven, and peeled the oven mitts from her hands.</div>

After a moment of searching, he found a smudge on the wall near the end of the bed, where her foot had touched it as they made love: a dime-sized spot where the paint was blotted away. He said nothing to Marilyn, and when they pushed the furniture back into place that evening, the dresser concealed the smudge. Every time he looked at that dresser he was pleased, as if he could see through the pine drawers and his folded clothing straight to it, that mark her body had left in his space.</div>

<div class="line_en">James felt he should return this privilege, this private gift. He had mentioned once, in passing, that his parents had worked at a school, leaving it at that, hoping she'd think teacher. But he had never told her how the school kitchen had been like the land of the giants, everything economy-sized: rolls of tinfoil half a mile long, jars of mayonnaise big enough to hold his head. His mother was in charge of bringing the world down to scale, chopping melons into dice-sized cubes, portioning pats of butter onto saucers to accompany each roll. He had never told anyone how the other kitchen ladies snickered at his mother for wrapping up the leftover food instead of throwing it away; how at home they'd reheat it in the oven while his parents quizzed him: What did you do in geography? What did you do in math? And he'd recite: Montgomery is the capital of Alabama. Prime numbers have only two factors. They didn't understand his answers, but they'd nodded, pleased that James was learning things they did not know. As they spoke, he would crumble crackers into a cup of celery soup, or peel waxed paper from a wedge of cheese sandwich, and pause, confused, certain he'd done this before, uncertain whether he was reviewing his studies or the whole schoolday. In the fifth grade, he had stopped speaking Chinese to his parents, afraid of tinting his English with an accent; long before that, he had stopped speaking to his parents at school at all. He was afraid to tell Marilyn these things, afraid that once he admitted them, she would see him as he had always seen himself: a scrawny outcast, feeding on scraps, reciting his lines and trying to pass. An imposter. He was afraid she would never see him any other way.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="詹姆斯很想回报她的信任——这是一份私密的礼物。他曾经含糊地提到自己的父母在一所学校工作，希望她会觉得他们是老师。他没向玛丽琳描述过学校的厨房是什么样子的——好比走进了巨人的房子，所有东西都是庞然大物：成排的锡纸卷足有半英里长，蛋黄酱的瓶子装得下他的脑袋。他母亲的职责是把巨大的东西分成小块，比如切甜瓜，把黄油分进小碟子里等等。他也没有告诉过别人，母亲舍不得扔掉剩菜、把它们带回家的举动，遭到其他厨娘的一致嘲笑。回到家里，父母会一边等着饭菜热好，一边向他提问：你在地理课上学了什么？数学课上学了什么？他会回答：“蒙哥马利是亚拉巴马州的首府”“质数只有两个因数”。虽然听不懂儿子在说什么，但父母都会点头，为儿子学到了他们不会的东西而感到高兴。趁着说话的工夫，他会把饼干压碎扔进芹菜汤，或者揭下奶酪三明治上的蜡纸，同时回想自己在学校度过的一天。五年级时，因为害怕讲英文有口音，他不再和父母说中文，而在此之前，他早就不和父母在学校里讲话了。他害怕告诉玛丽琳这些事，担心一旦和盘托出，她就会像他一直以来看待自己那样看待他——瘦骨嶙峋的弃儿，吃剩饭长大，只会背诵课文和考试，还是冒名顶替的骗子。他怕她形成了这个印象之后，就再也不会改变对他的看法。">查看中文翻译</div>

He promised himself he would never let those hands harden. As Marilyn took the chicken, burnished and bronze, from the oven, he was mesmerized by her deftness. It was beautiful, the way broth thickened to gravy under her guidance, how potatoes fluffed like cotton beneath her fork. This was the closest thing he'd seen to magic. A few months later, when they married, they would make a pact: to let the past drift away, to stop asking questions, to look forward from then on, never back.</div>

"Carlson as good as told me I'm in," he said to Marilyn whenever the subject came up.

<div class="line_en">"A baby," Marilyn said to James, over and over. "Our baby. So much better." By the time they were married, Marilyn would be only three months along, and it wouldn't show. To herself, she said, You can come back and finish that last year, when the baby is older. It would be almost eight years before school would seem real and possible and tangible again, but Marilyn didn't know that. As she left the dean's office, an indefinite leave secured, she was certain that everything she had dreamed for herself -- medical school, doctorhood, that new and important life -- sat poised for her return, like a well-trained dog awaiting its master. Still, when Marilyn sat down at the telephone table in the dorm lobby and gave the long-distance operator her mother's number, her voice shook with each digit. As her mother's voice finally came over the line, she forgot to say hello. Instead she blurted out, "I'm getting married. In June."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“孩子，”玛丽琳对詹姆斯不停地重复着，“我们的孩子，真是太好了。”他们结婚的时候，胎儿只有三个月，外人不会看出来。她也安慰自己：等孩子长大一些，你可以卷土重来，完成最后一年的学业。然而玛丽琳不知道的是，几乎要到八年以后，她才会重新踏足校园。她向院长请了无限期的长假，坚信自己的人生梦想——进医学院，成为医生——都在等待着她的回归，好比一只训练有素的狗等待它的主人。然而，当玛丽琳坐在宿舍门厅的电话旁，告诉长途接线员她母亲的电话号码时，每说一个数字，她的嗓音都会颤抖。母亲的声音终于从电话那头传来，玛丽琳忘记了问好，只是含糊地说：“我要结婚了。六月份。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Relief flooded Marilyn. Her mother wasn't upset about her leaving school early; why would she mind? Hadn't she done just what her mother had hoped: met a wonderful Harvard man? She read off the information from a slip of paper: Friday, June 13, eleven thirty, with the justice of the peace; lunch afterward at the Parker House. "It won't be a big party. Just us, and you, and a few of our friends. James's parents are both dead."</div>

<div class="line_en">Marilyn realized, suddenly, what her mother was imagining. It was 1958; in Virginia, in half the country, their wedding would break the law. Even in Boston, she sometimes saw disapproval in the eyes of the passersby. Her hair was no longer the white-blond of her childhood, but it was still light enough to catch attention when bent toward James's inky black head in movie theaters, on a park bench, at the counter at the Waldorf Cafeteria. A gaggle of Radcliffe girls came down the stairs, one hovering nearby to wait for the phone, the others crowding around the hall mirror to apply powder to their noses. One of them, just a week before, had heard about Marilyn's marriage and came by her room "to see if it was really true."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛丽琳突然意识到母亲在想什么。当时是1958年，在弗吉尼亚的一些乡村地区，他们的婚礼是违反法律的。甚至在波士顿，有时候她也会看到路人不以为然的目光。虽然她头发的颜色比童年时代深了许多，但在电影院里、公园长椅上、沃尔多夫餐厅内和黑头发的詹姆斯坐在一起时，还是会招来别人的注意。这时，拉德克利夫学院的一帮女孩从宿舍楼上下来，其中一个等着用电话，其他人围在门厅的镜子旁边补妆。有个女孩一周前听说玛丽琳准备结婚了，甚至特地去了她的宿舍，为了“看看这件事是不是真的”。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Marilyn and her mother had dinner alone that night, and her mother did not mention James until dessert. She knew what her mother would ask -- Why do you love him? -- and steeled herself for the question. But her mother didn't ask this at all, didn't mention the word love. Instead she swallowed a bite of cake and studied her daughter from across the table. "You're sure," she said, "that he doesn't just want a green card?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天，玛丽琳和母亲单独吃了晚餐，直到上甜点的时候，她母亲才提起詹姆斯。她知道母亲会问什么——你为什么爱他？——她已经做好了回答的准备。然而，母亲根本没问，没有提到“爱”这个词，她只是咽下嘴里的蛋糕，打量桌子对面的女儿。“你确定，”她说，“他不只是为了绿卡？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So her mother came in from Virginia, the first time she'd ever left the state. Standing at the station with James hours after his graduation, waiting for her mother's train, Marilyn told herself: she would have come anyway, even if I'd told her. Her mother stepped onto the platform and spotted Marilyn and a smile flashed across her face -- spontaneous, proud -- and for that instant, Marilyn believed it completely. Of course she would have. Then the smile flickered just for a moment, like a flash of static. Her gaze darted back and forth between the stout blond woman standing on her daughter's left and the skinny Oriental man on her right, looking for the advertised James, not finding him. Finally understanding. A few seconds passed before she shook James's hand, told him she was very, very happy to meet him, and allowed him to take her bag.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是，她母亲从弗吉尼亚赶来，这是她第一次离开弗吉尼亚州。詹姆斯的毕业典礼才结束几个小时，玛丽琳就和他站在月台上，等待母亲的火车进站。她告诉自己：无论如何，母亲都会来的，哪怕我把所有的事都告诉她。她母亲来到站台，看到玛丽琳，脸上迅速掠过一丝笑意——同时还掺杂着骄傲——那一刻，玛丽琳觉得自己的推测完全是正确的。当然是这样的。然而，她母亲的微笑如电光火石，转瞬即逝，她的目光很快便在女儿左边的金发女人和右边瘦削的东方男人之间扫射，寻找传说中的詹姆斯，却不敢确定。终于，她明白了。几秒钟后，她就握住詹姆斯的手，告诉他，她非常非常高兴见到他，还允许他帮她拿包。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The morning of the wedding, as they waited in the courthouse, Marilyn's mother kept fiddling with the clasp of her purse. They'd gotten there almost an hour early, worried about traffic, about parking, about missing their spot with the justice of the peace. James had put on a new suit and kept patting the breast pocket, checking for the rings through the navy-blue wool. Such a timid and nervous gesture made Marilyn want to kiss him right there in front of everyone. In twenty-five minutes she would be his wife. And then her mother stepped closer and took Marilyn's elbow in a grip that felt like a clamp.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="婚礼当天早晨，他们都在法院里等着的时候，玛丽琳的母亲一直在摆弄她提包上的扣环。他们早到了近一个小时——因为担心交通堵塞、无处停车、临时找不到治安法官等等问题。詹姆斯换上了一套崭新的藏蓝色羊毛西装，不停地拍打胸前的口袋，确保里面的两枚戒指没有丢失。他那个紧张羞怯的样子，让玛丽琳很想在众人面前吻他。再过二十五分钟，她就是他的妻子了。这时，她母亲靠过来，手像铁钳一样紧扣住玛丽琳的手肘。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Marilyn couldn't look at her. Instead she stared at her mother's hands, spotted despite the gloves and the lemon-scented lotion, at the fork pinched between the fingers, at the crumb clinging to the tines. A tiny wrinkle creased her mother's eyebrows, as if someone had nicked her forehead with a knife. Years later, Hannah would spy this same mark of deep worry on her mother's face, though she would not know its source, and Marilyn would never have admitted the resemblance. "He was born in California, Mother," she said, and her mother looked away and dabbed at her mouth with her napkin, leaving two red smears on the linen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛丽琳不敢直视她，只好盯着她的手和叉子看，虽然有手套和柠檬味护肤液的保护，那双手已经生了斑点，叉子尖上沾了一些面包屑。她母亲的眉毛附近有一条短短的皱纹，好像有人拿刀在她脸上划过一下。多年后，汉娜发现，当她的母亲忧心忡忡的时候，脸上也会出现相同的纹路，尽管她并不知道这条纹路是怎么来的，玛丽琳也不会承认她和母亲的这点肖似之处。“他生在加州，妈妈。”她说。她母亲不再看她，拿手绢擦了擦嘴，亚麻质料上出现两道红痕。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Just days before, hundreds of miles away, another couple had married, too -- a white man, a black woman, who would share a most appropriate name: Loving. In four months they would be arrested in Virginia, the law reminding them that Almighty God had never intended white, black, yellow, and red to mix, that there should be no mongrel citizens, no obliteration of racial pride. It would be four years before they protested, and four years more before the court concurred, but many more years before the people around them would, too.
