<div class="line_en">A boy's appetite grows very fast, and in a few moments the queer, empty feeling had become hunger, and the hunger grew bigger and bigger, until soon he was as ravenous as a bear.</div>

<div class="line_en">If the Cricket's death scared Pinocchio at all, it was only for a very few moments. For, as night came on, a queer, empty feeling at the pit of his stomach reminded the Marionette that he had eaten nothing as yet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时候天开始黑了，皮诺乔猛想起他还没吃过点东西，就觉得肚子在咕噜咕噜叫，真想吃。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Poor Pinocchio ran to the fireplace where the pot was boiling and stretched out his hand to take the cover off, but to his amazement the pot was only painted! Think how he felt! His long nose became at least two inches longer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可怜的皮诺乔马上向壁炉扑过去，那儿有个锅子在冒热气，他打算揭开锅盖，看看里面在煮什么，谁知那锅子是画在墙上的，诸位想象一下吧，他是多么失望啊，他那个本来已经很长的鼻子，马上又至少长了四指。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He ran about the room, dug in all the boxes and drawers, and even looked under the bed in search of a piece of bread, hard though it might be, or a cookie, or perhaps a bit of fish. A bone left by a dog would have tasted good to him! But he found nothing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是他满屋子乱跑，搜遍了所有的抽屉、所有的角落，只想找到点面包，哪怕是一丁点儿干面包，只想找到点硬面包皮、狗啃过的骨头、发霉的玉米糊、鱼骨头、樱桃核，总而言之，随便找到什么可以进口的东西都好，可他什么也没找到，一丁点儿东西也没找到。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And meanwhile his hunger grew and grew. The only relief poor Pinocchio had was to yawn; and he certainly did yawn, such a big yawn that his mouth stretched out to the tips of his ears. Soon he became dizzy and faint.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时他肚子越来越饿，越来越饿，可怜的皮诺乔，他除了打哈欠，就毫无办法可以让肚子好过一点儿。他的哈欠打得那么长，每一回嘴巴都一直咧到耳朵边。打完一个哈欠他就吐口水，只觉得胃也要吐出来了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Suddenly, he saw, among the sweepings in a corner, something round and white that looked very much like a hen's egg. In a jiffy he pounced upon it. It was an egg.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="正在这时候，他看到一堆垃圾里好像有一样东西，圆滚滚的、白花花的，完全像个鸡蛋。他一蹦就跳了过去，扑到它上面，的的确确是个鸡蛋。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He wept and wailed to himself:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后他绝望了，哭着说：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The Talking Cricket was right. It was wrong of me to disobey Father and to run away from home. If he were here now, I wouldn't be so hungry! Oh, how horrible it is to be hungry!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“会说话的蟋蟀说得对，我错就错在不听爸爸的话，逃出了屋子……我爸爸要是在这儿，这会儿我就不会一个劲儿打哈欠，人都要打死了！唉哟！肚子饿多难受啊！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But in place of the white and the yolk of the egg, a little yellow Chick, fluffy and gay and smiling, escaped from it. Bowing politely to Pinocchio, he said to him:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可蛋壳里倒出来的不是蛋白和蛋黄，而是一只小鸡。小鸡又快活又有礼貌，姿势优美地鞠个躬说：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Marionette's joy knew no bounds. It is impossible to describe it, you must picture it to yourself. Certain that he was dreaming, he turned the egg over and over in his hands, fondled it, kissed it, and talked to it:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="木偶这份高兴是只可意会，无法形容的，他简直像在做梦，一个劲儿把鸡蛋捧在手上，转过来转过去，又摸又吻，一面吻还一面说：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"And now, how shall I cook you? Shall I make an omelet? No, it is better to fry you in a pan! Or shall I drink you? No, the best way is to fry you in the pan. You will taste better."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这会儿我该怎么吃这个蛋呢，煎来吃不好吗？……不，放在盘子里煮更好！……噢，用煎锅煎最好，还有比煎鸡蛋更好吃的吗？噢，不弄熟怎么样，就生着吃？不，还是放在盘子里煮，或者用煎锅煎好，我想吃得要命啦！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">No sooner said than done. He placed a little pan over a foot warmer full of hot coals. In the pan, instead of oil or butter, he poured a little water. As soon as the water started to boil -- tac! -- he broke the eggshell.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="说干就干，他把煎锅放在一个烧炭的火盆上，在煎锅里他放的不是素油不是牛油，而是水。等到水一冒气，卡嗒！……他敲破鸡蛋壳，就要把蛋倒进去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The poor Marionette stood as if turned to stone, with wide eyes, open mouth, and the empty halves of the egg-shell in his hands. When he came to himself, he began to cry and shriek at the top of his lungs, stamping his feet on the ground and wailing all the while:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可怜的木偶站在那里发呆，眼睛瞪大，嘴巴张开，手里拿着两瓣鸡蛋壳。他这么愣了一阵，等到最后清醒过来，就哇哇地又哭又叫，绝望得跺脚，一面哭一面说：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And as his stomach kept grumbling more than ever and he had nothing to quiet it with, he thought of going out for a walk to the near-by village, in the hope of finding some charitable person who might give him a bit of bread.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="肚子继续咕噜咕噜响，越响越厉害，他又不知道该怎么办才叫它不响，他觉得还是离开屋子，到隔壁村子去看看，巴望能碰到个好心人，会施舍点面包给他吃吃。">查看中文翻译</div>
