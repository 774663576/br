Didn't see what that had to do with it. Never in a debtors' prison?-- Come, once again. Never? Yes. How many times? Two or three times. Not five or six? Perhaps. Of what profession? Gentleman. Ever been kicked? Might have been. Frequently? No. Ever kicked downstairs? Decidedly not; once received a kick on the top of a staircase, and fell downstairs of his own accord. Kicked on that occasion for cheating at dice? Something to that effect was said by the intoxicated liar who committed the assault, but it was not true. Swear it was not true? Positively. Ever live by cheating at play? Never. Ever live by play? Not more than other gentlemen do. Ever borrow money of the prisoner? Yes. Ever pay him? No. Was not this intimacy with the prisoner, in reality a very slight one, forced upon the prisoner in coaches, inns, and packets? No. Sure he saw the prisoner with these lists? Certain. Knew no more about the lists? No. Had not procured them himself, for instance? No. Expect to get anything by this evidence? No. Not in regular government pay and employment, to lay traps? Oh dear no.

<div class="line_en">The virtuous servant, Roger Cly, swore his way through the case at a great rate. He had taken service with the prisoner, in good faith and simplicity, four years ago. He had asked the prisoner, aboard the Calais packet, if he wanted a handy fellow, and the prisoner had engaged him. He had not asked the prisoner to take the handy fellow as an act of charity -- never thought of such a thing. He began to have suspicions of the prisoner, and to keep an eye upon him, soon afterwards. In arranging his clothes, while travelling, he had seen similar lists to these in the prisoner's pockets, over and over again. He had taken these lists from the drawer of the prisoner's desk. He had not put them there first. He had seen the prisoner show these identical lists to French gentlemen at Calais, and similar lists to French gentlemen, both at Calais and Boulogne. He loved his country, and couldn't bear it, and had given information. He had never been suspected of stealing a silver tea-pot; he had been maligned respecting a mustard-pot, but it turned out to be only a plated one. He had known the last witness seven or eight years; that was merely a coincidence. He didn't call it a particularly curious coincidence; most coincidences were curious. Neither did he call it a curious coincidence that true patriotism was his only motive too. He was a true Briton, and hoped there were many like him.</div>

The prisoner's counsel was cross-examining this witness with no result, except that he had never seen the prisoner on any other occasion, when the wigged gentleman who had all this time been looking at the ceiling of the court, wrote a word or two on a little piece of paper, screwed it up, and tossed it to him.

My Lord inquired of Mr. Stryver (the prisoner's counsel), whether they were next to try Mr. Carton (name of my learned friend) for treason? But, Mr. Stryver replied to my Lord, no; but he would ask the witness to tell him whether what happened once, might happen twice; whether he would have been so confident if he had seen this illustration of his rashness sooner, whether he would be so confident, having seen it; and more.

How the virtuous servant, Cly, was his friend and partner, and was worthy to be; how the watchful eyes of those forgers and false swearers had rested on the prisoner as a victim, because some family affairs in France, he being of French extraction, did require his making those passages across the Channel -- though what those affairs were, a consideration for others who were near and dear to him, forbade him, even for his life, to disclose. How the evidence that had been warped and wrested from the young lady, whose anguish in giving it they had witnessed, came to nothing, involving the mere little innocent gallantries and politenesses likely to pass between any young gentleman and young lady so thrown together;-- with the exception of that reference to George Washington, which was altogether too extravagant and impossible to be regarded in any other light than as a monstrous joke. How it would be a weakness in the government to break down in this attempt to practise for popularity on the lowest national antipathies and fears, and therefore Mr. Attorney-General had made the most of it; how, nevertheless, it rested upon nothing, save that vile and infamous character of evidence too often disfiguring such cases, and of which the State Trials of this country were full.

Something especially reckless in his demeanour, not only gave him a disreputable look, but so diminished the strong resemblance he undoubtedly bore to the prisoner (which his momentary earnestness, when they were compared together, had strengthened), that many of the lookers-on, taking note of him now, said to one another they would hardly have thought the two were so alike. Mr. Cruncher made the observation to his next neighbour, and added, "I'd hold half a guinea that he don't get no law-work to do. Don't look like the sort of one to get any, do he?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="即使在这样的波澜起伏的情况之下，一直望着法庭天花板的卡尔顿先生仍然没有挪一挪身子，或改一改态度。在他那学识渊博的朋友斯特莱佛整理着面前的文件、跟他身边的人低声交谈，而且不时焦灼地望望陪审团的时候；在所有的观众都多少走动走动、另行组成谈话圈子的时候；甚至在连我们的检察官也离开了座位，在台上缓缓地踱来踱去，未必不使观众怀疑他很紧张的时候，这位先生仍然靠在椅背上没有动。他那拉开的律师长袍一半敞着，零乱的假发还是脱下后随手扣上的样子。他双手抄在口袋里，两眼仍然像那一整天那样死死盯住天花板。他有一种特别马虎的神态，不但看去显得不受人尊重，而且大大降低了他跟囚犯之间毫无疑问的相似程度（刚才大家把他俩做比较时，他暂时的认真态度曾强化了相似的印象），因此许多观众现在都注意到了他，并交换意见说他们刚才怎么会认为他们俩那么相像呢。克朗彻先生对他身边的人就是这样说的。他还说，“我可以用半个金币打赌，这人是得不到法律工作做的。他那副模样就不像，是么？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mr. Stryver then called his few witnesses, and Mr. Cruncher had next to attend while Mr. Attorney-General turned the whole suit of clothes Mr. Stryver had fitted on the jury, inside out; showing how Barsad and Cly were even a hundred times better than he had thought them, and the prisoner a hundred times worse. Lastly, came my Lord himself, turning the suit of clothes, now inside out, now outside in, but on the whole decidedly trimming and shaping them into grave-clothes for the prisoner.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后斯特莱佛先生要求他的几个证人出席作了证。再以后克朗彻先生便听见副检察长先生把斯特莱佛先生为陪审团剪裁的衣服整个儿地翻了过来；他表示巴萨和克莱甚至比他估计的还要好一百倍，而囚犯则要坏一百倍。最后，法官大人发言，他把这件衣服时而翻了过来，时而又翻了过去，总而言之，肯定是把它整个儿重新剪裁了一次，做成了一件给囚犯穿的尸衣。">查看中文翻译</div>

Help the gentleman to take her out. Don't you see she will fall!"</div>

<div class="line_en">They were not agreed, and wished to retire. My Lord (perhaps with George Washington on his mind) showed some surprise that they were not agreed, but signified his pleasure that they should retire under watch and ward, and retired himself.

The spectators dropped off to get refreshment, and the prisoner withdrew to the back of the dock, and sat down.</div>

<div class="line_en">There was much commiseration for her as she was removed, and much sympathy with her father. It had evidently been a great distress to him, to have the days of his imprisonment recalled. He had shown strong internal agitation when he was questioned, and that pondering or brooding look which made him old, had been upon him, like a heavy cloud, ever since. As he passed out, the jury, who had turned back and paused a moment, spoke, through their foreman.</div>
