<div class="line_en">Sixty seconds. That's how long we're required to stand on our metal circles before the sound of a gong releases us. Step off before the minute is up, and land mines blow your legs off. Sixty seconds to take in the ring of tributes all equidistant from the Cornucopia, a giant golden horn shaped like a cone with a curved tail, the mouth of which is at least twenty feet high, spilling over with the things that will give us life here in the arena. Food, containers of water, weapons, medicine, garments, fire starters. Strewn around the Cornucopia are other supplies, their value decreasing the farther they are from the horn. For instance, only a few steps from my feet lies a three-foot square of plastic. Certainly it could be of some use in a downpour. But there in the mouth, I can see a tent pack that would protect from almost any sort of weather. If I had the guts to go in and fight for it against the other twenty-three tributes. Which I have been instructed not to do.</div>

<div class="line_en">I'm fast. I can sprint faster than any of the girls in our school although a couple can beat me in distance races. But this forty-yard length, this is what I am built for. I know I can get it, I know I can reach it first, but then the question is how quickly can I get out of there? By the time I've scrambled up the packs and grabbed the weapons, others will have reached the horn, and one or two I might be able to pick off, but say there's a dozen, at that close range, they could take me down with the spears and the clubs. Or their own powerful fists.</div>

There, resting on a mound of blanket rolls, is a silver sheath of arrows and a bow, already strung, just waiting to be engaged. That's mine, I think. It's meant for me.</div>

<div class="line_en">Haymitch has never seen me run. Maybe if he had he'd tell me to go for it. Get the weapon. Since that's the very weapon that might be my salvation. And I only see one bow in that whole pile. I know the minute must be almost up and will have to decide what my strategy will be and I find myself positioning my feet to run, not away into the surrounding forests but toward the pile, toward the bow. When suddenly I notice Peeta, he's about five tributes to my right, quite a fair distance, still I can tell he's looking at me and I think he might be shaking his head. But the sun's in my eyes, and while I'm puzzling over it the gong rings out.</div>

<div class="line_en">And I've missed it! I've missed my chance! Because those extra couple of seconds I've lost by not being ready are enough to change my mind about going in. My feet shuffle for a moment, confused at the direction my brain wants to take and then I lunge forward, scoop up the sheet of plastic and a loaf of bread. The pickings are so small and I'm so angry with Peeta for distracting me that I sprint in twenty yards to retrieve a bright orange backpack that could hold anything because I can't stand leaving with virtually nothing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那一瞬间，我错过了，错过了最佳时机！开始的几秒我没能做好准备，就足以让我改变冲向宙斯之角的主意了。我犹疑着，不知该往哪个方向跑。紧接着，我猛往前跑，拿起地上的塑料布和一块面包。我的东西少得可怜，我真恨皮特在这个时候分我的神。我又向前疾跑了二十码，拿到一个鲜艳的橘色背包，因为我不能忍受在几乎一无所有的情况下离开。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">All the general fear I've been feeling condenses into an immediate fear of this girl, this predator who might kill me in seconds. Adrenaline shoots through me and I sling the pack over one shoulder and run full-speed for the woods. I can hear the blade whistling toward me and reflexively hike the pack up to protect my head. The blade lodges in the pack. Both straps on my shoulders now, I make for the trees. Somehow I know the girl will not pursue me.

<div class="line_en">At the edge of the woods I turn for one instant to survey the field. About a dozen or so tributes are hacking away at one another at the horn. Several lie dead already on the ground. Those who have taken flight are disappearing into the trees or into the void opposite me. I continue running until the woods have hidden me from the other tributes then slow into a steady jog that I think I can maintain for a while. For the next few hours, I alternate between jogging and walking, putting as much distance as I can between myself and my competitors. I lost my bread during the struggle with the boy from District 9 but managed to stuff my plastic in my sleeve so as I walk I fold it neatly and tuck it into a pocket. I also free the knife -- it's a fine one with a long sharp blade, serrated near the handle, which will make it handy for sawing through things -- and slide it into my belt. I don't dare stop to examine the contents of the pack yet. I just keep moving, pausing only to check for pursuers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="跑到林子边时，我回头看了一眼。大约有十几个“贡品”正在那堆供给品上你争我夺，一些人躺在地上，已经被杀身亡。有幸逃出的人已经消失在林子里或跑到我对面的地带。我不停地奔跑，直到逃出其他“贡品”的视线之外，然后我开始慢跑，这样能多坚持一段。在以后的几个小时时间里，我时而慢跑，时而快走，尽可能远离我的对手。我和九区的男孩抢包的时候失去了面包，但当时我尽量把塑料布塞到袖子里。我边走边把它叠成整齐的小块。我把刀子也拔了下来，别在腰带上。这把刀不错，长而锋利的刀刃，在靠近刀柄处还有锯齿，方便切割。我还不敢停下来检查包里的物品，只是不停的向前走，偶尔停一下，看看是否有人追踪。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I can go a long time. I know that from my days in the woods. But I will need water. That was Haymitch's second instruction, and since I sort of botched the first, I keep a sharp eye out for any sign of it. No luck.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我能走很长时间，我在十二区丛林中时，就知道这一点。可我还需要水。这是黑密斯的第二道指令。他的第一道指令我没能很好地遵守，因而此时我特别留心着水源。毫无踪影。运气差！">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The ground slopes down. I don't particularly like this. Valleys make me feel trapped. I want to be high, like in the hills around District 12, where I can see my enemies approaching. But I have no choice but to keep going.</div>

<div class="line_en">Funny though, I don't feel too bad. The days of gorging myself have paid off. I've got staying power even though I'm short on sleep. Being in the woods is rejuvenating. I'm glad for the solitude, even though it's an illusion, because I'm probably on-screen right now. Not consistently but off and on. There are so many deaths to show the first day that a tribute trekking through the woods isn't much to look at. But they'll show me enough to let people know I'm alive, uninjured and on the move. One of the heaviest days of betting is the opening, when the initial casualties come in. But that can't compare to what happens as the field shrinks to a handful of players.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可笑的是，我并不觉得太糟。前一阵大吃大喝有了效果，就算睡得少，我也精力充沛，因为丛林为我注入了活力。我喜欢独处，尽管只是想象中的，因为也许我现在正出现在屏幕上。当然不是连续不断，而是时断时续。第一天死了那么多人，一个“贡品”在林中独行也没什么好看的。但也会播放少许有关我的镜头，以使观众确定我还活着、没受伤、正在向前走。猎杀游戏开始的第一天是赌博下注最多的一天，这一天产生了最早伤亡人员。在这一切都无法与比赛接近尾声时少数选手的厮杀来得惊心动魄。">查看中文翻译</div>

If there's one rabbit, there could be hundreds just waiting to be snared.</div>

<div class="line_en">It's late afternoon when I begin to hear the cannons. Each shot represents a dead tribute. The fighting must have finally stopped at the Cornucopia. They never collect the bloodbath bodies until the killers have dispersed. On the opening day, they don't even fire the cannons until the initial fighting's over because it's too hard to keep track of the fatalities. I allow myself to pause, panting, as I count the shots. One… two… three… on and on until they reach eleven. Eleven dead in all. Thirteen left to play. My fingernails scrape at the dried blood the boy from District 9 coughed into my face. He's gone, certainly. I wonder about Peeta. Has he lasted through the day? I'll know in a few hours. When they project the dead's images into the sky for the rest of us to see.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="但现在，对付那些对手是我要首先考虑的问题。我肯定夜间也会有很多“贡品”在继续捕杀行动。那些在宙斯之角厮杀的人会得到食物、湖里的水、火炬、手电筒和他们急于要使用的武器。我只能指望我已经走得够远，超出他们目前的捕猎范围。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I'm hungry, too, but I don't dare break into my precious store of crackers and beef yet. Instead, I take my knife and go to work on a pine tree, cutting away the outer bark and scraping off a large handful of the softer inner bark. I slowly chew the stuff as I walk along. After a week of the finest food in the world, it's a little hard to choke down. But I've eaten plenty of pine in my life. I'll adjust quickly.</div>

<div class="line_en">I pick my tree carefully. A willow, not terribly tall but set in a clump of other willows, offering concealment in those long, flowing tresses. I climb up, sticking to the stronger branches close to the trunk, and find a sturdy fork for my bed. It takes some doing, but I arrange the sleeping bag in a relatively comfortable manner. I place my backpack in the foot of the bag, then slide in after it. As a precaution, I remove my belt, loop it all the way around the branch and my sleeping bag, and refasten it at my waist. Now if I roll over in my sleep, I won't go crashing to the ground. I'm small enough to tuck the top of the bag over my head, but I put on my hood as well. As night falls, the air is cooling quickly. Despite the risk I took in getting the backpack, I know now it was the right choice. This sleeping bag, radiating back and preserving my body heat, will be invaluable. I'm sure there are several other tributes whose biggest concern right now is how to stay warm whereas I may actually be able to get a few hours of sleep. If only I wasn't so thirsty…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我精心挑选了一棵柳树，不很高，但却和其他柳树紧挨着，有长长的、飘动的枝条，十分隐秘。我爬到树上一个紧挨着树干的树枝，找了一个结实的树杈放好睡袋，很费了一番力气。我把睡袋放在相对舒服的位置，又把背包放在睡袋脚头，之后钻了进去。为了更安全，我把皮带解下来，绕着睡袋和树枝绑了一圈，在手腕的位置把它勒紧。现在就算我睡着时翻身，也不会摔到地上。我身材瘦小，正好睡袋可以盖住头顶，我把睡袋兜帽也盖上。到了深夜，气温会很快下降。尽管抢背包时冒了很大的险，可现在看来我的选择没错。这个睡袋可以很好地保持我的体温，真实无价之宝。我肯定有些“贡品”此时最担心的是如何保暖，而我还可以睡几个小时。要是没这么渴该有多好…">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Before settling down, I take my wire and set two twitch-up snares in the brush. I know it's risky to be setting traps, but food will go so fast out here. And I can't set snares on the run. Still, I walk another five minutes before making camp.</div>

<div class="line_en">The first to appear is the girl from District 3. That means that the Career Tributes from 1 and 2 have all survived. No surprise there. Then the boy from 4. I didn't expect that one, usually all the Careers make it through the first day. The boy from District 5… I guess the fox-faced girl made it. Both tributes from 6 and 7. The boy from 8. Both from 9. Yes, there's the boy who I fought for the backpack. I've run through my fingers, only one more dead tribute to go. Is it Peeta? No, there's the girl from District 10. That's it. The Capitol seal is back with a final musical flourish. Then darkness and the sounds of the forest resume.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第一个出现的是三区的女孩，那就是说一区和二区的职业选手活了下来，这不奇怪。之后是四区的男孩，我没料到，通常职业选手都能活过第一天。五区的男孩…我猜是狐狸脸女孩活了下来。六区、七区的“贡品”都死了，之后是八区的男孩，九区的俩个“贡品”，是的，还有和我抢包的那个男孩，我掐指计算着，只剩一个了。会是皮特吗？不是，是十区的女孩。就这些。此后伴随着雄壮的音乐声，画面上出现了凯匹特市徽。之后是一片黑暗，森林恢复了寂静。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Night has just come when I hear the anthem that proceeds the death recap. Through the branches I can see the seal of the Capitol, which appears to be floating in the sky. I'm actually viewing another screen, an enormous one that's transported by one of their disappearing hovercraft. The anthem fades out and the sky goes dark for a moment. At home, we would be watching full coverage of each and every killing, but that's thought to give an unfair advantage to the living tributes. For instance, if I got my hands on the bow and shot someone, my secret would be revealed to all. No, here in the arena, all we see are the same photographs they showed when they televised our training scores. Simple head shots. But now instead of scores they post only district numbers. I take a deep breath as the faces of the eleven dead tributes begin and tick them off one by one on my fingers.</div>

This is what I tell myself to explain the conflicting emotions that arise when I think of Peeta. The gratitude that he gave me an edge by professing his love for me in the interview. The anger at his superiority on the roof. The dread that we may come face-to-face at any moment in this arena.</div>

<div class="line_en">Snap! The sound of a breaking branch wakes me. How long have I been asleep? Four hours? Five? The tip of my nose is icy cold. Snap! Snap! What's going on? This is not the sound of a branch under someone's foot, but the sharp crack of one coming from a tree. Snap! Snap! I judge it to be several hundred yards to my right. Slowly, noiselessly, I turn myself in that direction. For a few minutes, there's nothing but blackness and some scuffling. Then I see a spark and a small fire begins to bloom. A pair of hands warms over flames, but I can't make out more than that.</div>

<div class="line_en">I have to bite my lip not to scream every foul name I know at the fire starter. What are they thinking? A fire lit just at nightfall would have been one thing. Those who battled at the Cornucopia, with their superior strength and surplus of supplies, they couldn't possibly have been near enough to spot the flames then.

<div class="line_en">So they're fighting in a pack. I'm not really surprised. Often alliances are formed in the early stages of the Games. The strong band together to hunt down the weak then, when the tension becomes too great, begin to turn on one another. I don't have to wonder too hard who has made this alliance. It'll be the remaining Career Tributes from Districts 1, 2, and 4. Two boys and three girls. The ones who lunched together.</div>
