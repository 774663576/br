<div class="line_en">It was three years ago. It was on a dark evening, in a narrow side-street near one of the big railway stations. She was standing near a doorway in the wall, under a street lamp that hardly gave any light. She had a young face, painted very thick. It was really the paint that appealed to me, the whiteness of it, like a mask, and the bright red lips. Party women never paint their faces. There was nobody else in the street, and no telescreens. She said two dollars. I --</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="温斯顿在日记上写道：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For the moment it was too difficult to go on. He shut his eyes and pressed his fingers against them, trying to squeeze out the vision that kept recurring. He had an almost overwhelming temptation to shout a string of filthy words at the top of his voice. Or to bang his head against the wall, to kick over the table and hurl the inkpot through the window -- to do any violent or noisy or painful thing that might black out the memory that was tormenting him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一时难于写下去了。他闭上眼睛，用手指压着，努力想把一再出现的形象挤出去。他很想高声喊出一串肮脏的字眼。或者将头砰地一下撞墙，将桌子踢翻，将墨水瓶扔到窗外——做任何暴力或叫嚷或痛苦的事情，可以让折磨他的记忆消失。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Your worst enemy, he reflected, was your own nervous system. At any moment the tension inside you was liable to translate itself into some visible symptom. He thought of a man whom he had passed in the street a few weeks back: a quite ordinary-looking man, a Party member, aged thirty-five or forty, tallish and thin, carrying a briefcase. They were a few metres apart when the left side of the man's face was suddenly contorted by a sort of spasm. It happened again just as they were passing one another: it was only a twitch, a quiver, rapid as the clicking of a camera shutter, but obviously habitual. He remembered thinking at the time: That poor devil is done for. And what was frightening was that the action was quite possibly unconscious. The most deadly danger of all was talking in your sleep. There was no way of guarding against that, so far as he could see.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他想，你最坏的敌人就是你自己的神经系统。你内心的紧张能够转换为某些可见的症状。他想到一个人，那是几个星期后他在街上碰到的。一个模样相当普通的男人，三十五岁或四十岁，又高又瘦，带着一只公文包。当这个人的左脸突然一阵抽搐而扭曲时，彼此只有几米远了。他们擦身而过的时候，这情况再次发生。这只是一种抽搐，一种颤动，速度很快，就像相机的快门一样，但显然是习惯性的。他记得那时候想过：这可怜的家伙完了。让人恐怖的是，这动作很可能是无意识的。最可怕的是说梦话。据他所知，这是无法防备的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">His teeth were set on edge. He would have liked to spit. Simultaneously with the woman in the basement kitchen he thought of Katharine, his wife. Winston was married -- had been married, at any rate: probably he still was married, for so far as he knew his wife was not dead. He seemed to breathe again the warm stuffy odour of the basement kitchen, an odour compounded of bugs and dirty clothes and villainous cheap scent, but nevertheless alluring, because no woman of the Party ever used scent, or could be imagined as doing so. Only the proles used scent. In his mind the smell of it was inextricably mixed up with fornication.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他牙齿咬紧，感到不舒服，想要吐唾沫。和那女人在地下室厨房时他想起了妻子凯瑟琳。温斯顿有婚姻——不管怎么说结过婚，也许他仍然是已婚者，他所知道的是他的妻子没有死。他似乎再一次呼吸到地下室厨房闷热的空气，空气中混合着臭虫、脏衣服和劣质香水的怪味，然而，这味道也迷人，因为没有党员妇女用香水，或会想到用香水。只有无产者用香水。在他心目中，香水的味道必然与私通联系在一起。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When he had gone with that woman it had been his first lapse in two years or thereabouts. Consorting with prostitutes was forbidden, of course, but it was one of those rules that you could occasionally nerve yourself to break. It was dangerous, but it was not a life-and-death matter. To be caught with a prostitute might mean five years in a forced-labour camp: not more, if you had committed no other offence. And it was easy enough, provided that you could avoid being caught in the act. The poorer quarters swarmed with women who were ready to sell themselves. Some could even be purchased for a bottle of gin, which the proles were not supposed to drink. Tacitly the Party was even inclined to encourage prostitution, as an outlet for instincts which could not be altogether suppressed. Mere debauchery did not matter very much, so long as it was furtive and joyless, and only involved the women of a submerged and despised class. The unforgivable crime was promiscuity between Party members. But -- though this was one of the crimes that the accused in the great purges invariably confessed to -- it was difficult to imagine any such thing actually happening.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他和那个女人睡在一起，这是他两年左右的时间里第一次行为不检。与妓女勾搭自然是禁止的，当然，这是那些条例之一，你可以偶尔鼓起勇气加以打破的。这是危险的，但这不是危及生命的事情。和妓女在一起时被逮住，意味着在劳改营里待上五年，不会再多了，如果你没有犯其他罪的话。要避免被逮个正着其实也不难。贫穷的街区有许多女人在游荡，准备出卖自己。有的女人甚至为一瓶杜松子酒就把自己卖了，无产者通常喝不到这种酒。党甚至暗中鼓励卖淫，作为本能的一个释放渠道，因为本能是无法彻底压制的。纵情酒色无伤大雅，只要暗中进行、无关欢愉，只涉及下层阶级的女子而已。不可饶恕的罪行是党员之间乱搞。但——虽然这是罪行之一，大清洗中那些受指控的人通常为此忏悔——难以想象这样的事情实际上发生过。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The aim of the Party was not merely to prevent men and women from forming loyalties which it might not be able to control. Its real, undeclared purpose was to remove all pleasure from the sexual act. Not love so much as eroticism was the enemy, inside marriage as well as outside it. All marriages between Party members had to be approved by a committee appointed for the purpose, and -- though the principle was never clearly stated -- permission was always refused if the couple concerned gave the impression of being physically attracted to one another. The only recognised purpose of marriage was to beget children for the service of the Party. Sexual intercourse was to be looked on as a slightly disgusting minor operation, like having an enema. This again was never put into plain words, but in an indirect way it was rubbed into every Party member from childhood onwards. There were even organisations such as the Junior Anti-Sex League which advocated complete celibacy for both sexes. All children were to be begotten by artificial insemination (artsem, it was called in Newspeak) and brought up in public institutions. This, Winston was aware, was not meant altogether seriously, but somehow it fitted in with the general ideology of the Party. The Party was trying to kill the sex instinct, or, if it could not be killed, then to distort it and dirty it. He did not know why this was so, but it seemed natural that it should be so. And so far as the women were concerned, the Party's efforts were largely successful.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="党的目的并非只是防止男女党员彼此忠诚，而党又难于加以控制。党真正的、未经宣布的目标是从性行为中清除所有的快乐。无论是婚姻之内还是之外，比起爱情来，情欲更是敌人。所有党员之间的婚姻必须得到为此目标设立的一个委员会的批准，而且——虽然有关规则从来没有宣布过——如果男女双方给人以肉体上彼此吸收的印象，那他们的结婚申请通常会被拒绝。唯一得到认可的婚姻的目的是为党服务而养育孩子。性行为被视为有点令人难堪的小手术，就像洗肠一样。而这种事也没有明文交代，但从儿童开始，以间接的方式深入到每个党员的心中。甚至有青少年反性联盟这样的组织，鼓吹男女两性过彻底的禁欲生活。所有的儿童通过人工授精（新语称为人授）生育，由公家抚养。温斯顿知道，这并非郑重其事的决定，但某种程度上符合党的普遍的意识形态。党极力要消灭性本能，或者，如果消灭不了，也要加以扭曲和丑化。他不知道为什么会这样，但似乎又应该是这样。就妇女而言，党的努力很大程度上是成功的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Katharine was a tall, fair-haired girl, very straight, with splendid movements. She had a bold, aquiline face, a face that one might have called noble until one discovered that there was as nearly as possible nothing behind it. Very early in their married life he had decided -- though perhaps it was only that he knew her more intimately than he knew most people -- that she had without exception the most stupid, vulgar, empty mind that he had ever encountered. She had not a thought in her head that was not a slogan, and there was no imbecility, absolutely none, that she was not capable of swallowing if the Party handed it out to her. "The human sound-track" he nicknamed her in his own mind. Yet he could have endured living with her if it had not been for just one thing -- sex.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凯瑟琳是高个、金发女孩，身材挺立，动作潇洒。她有一张大胆自信的脸，这张脸给人高贵的感觉，但你会发现这张脸后面几乎什么都没有。在他们婚姻生活的初期，他断定——虽然这也许只是因为他对她比对其他大多数人有更多的了解——她绝对是他所遇到的最愚蠢、庸俗、空虚的人。她头脑里的所有思想都只是口号；只要是党提出来的，即使是最弱智的东西她也会信以为真。他私下里给她取了个绰号叫“人声录音带”。然而，他还是可以勉强地和她过日子，但只为一件事——性。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He thought again of Katharine. It must be nine, ten -- nearly eleven years since they had parted. It was curious how seldom he thought of her. For days at a time he was capable of forgetting that he had ever been married. They had only been together for about fifteen months. The Party did not permit divorce, but it rather encouraged separation in cases where there were no children.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他又想到凯瑟琳。他们分手多半有九或十——几乎十一年了。很奇怪他很少想到她。有些日子，他能够忘掉他曾经结过婚。他们在一起大约有十五个月。党不允许离婚，但如果没有孩子，多少鼓励分居。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As soon as he touched her she seemed to wince and stiffen. To embrace her was like embracing a jointed wooden image. And what was strange was that even when she was clasping him against her he had the feeling that she was simultaneously pushing him away with all her strength. The rigidity of her muscles managed to convey that impression. She would lie there with shut eyes, neither resisting nor co-operating, but submitting. It was extraordinarily embarrassing, and, after a while, horrible. But even then he could have borne living with her if it had been agreed that they should remain celibate. But curiously enough it was Katharine who refused this. They must, she said, produce a child if they could. So the performance continued to happen, once a week quite regularly, whenever it was not impossible. She used even to remind him of it in the morning, as something which had to be done that evening and which must not be forgotten. She had two names for it. One was "making a baby", and the other was "our duty to the Party": yes, she had actually used that phrase. Quite soon he grew to have a feeling of positive dread when the appointed day came round. But luckily no child appeared, and in the end she agreed to give up trying, and soon afterwards they parted.</div>

<div class="line_en">He saw himself standing there in the dim lamplight, with the smell of bugs and cheap scent in his nostrils, and in his heart a feeling of defeat and resentment which even at that moment was mixed up with the thought of Katharine's white body, frozen for ever by the hypnotic power of the Party. Why did it always have to be like this? Why could he not have a woman of his own instead of these filthy scuffles at intervals of years? But a real love affair was an almost unthinkable event. The women of the Party were all alike. Chastity was as deeply ingrained in them as Party loyalty. By careful early conditioning, by games and cold water, by the rubbish that was dinned into them at school and in the Spies and the Youth League, by lectures, parades, songs, slogans and martial music, the natural feeling had been driven out of them. His reason told him that there must be exceptions, but his heart did not believe it. They were all impregnable, as the Party intended that they should be. And what he wanted, more even than to be loved, was to break down that wall of virtue, even if it were only once in his whole life. The sexual act, successfully performed, was rebellion. Desire was thoughtcrime. Even to have awakened Katharine, if he could have achieved it, would have been like a seduction, although she was his wife.</div>
