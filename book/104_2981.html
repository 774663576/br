<div class="line_en">I learned, however, what they looked like, those lovely, maddening, thin-armed nymphets, when they grew up. I remember walking along an animated street on a gray spring afternoon somewhere near the Madeleine. A short slim girl passed me at a rapid, high-heeled, tripping step, we glanced back at the same moment, she stopped and I accosted her. She came hardly up to my chest hair and had the kind of dimpled round little face French girls so often have, and I liked her long lashes and tight-fitting tailored dress sheathing in pearl-gray her young body which still retained -- and that was the nymphic echo, the chill of delight, the leap in my loins -- a childish something mingling with the professional frétillement of her small agile rump. I asked her price, and she promptly replied with melodious silvery precision (a bird, a very bird!) "Cent". I tried to haggle but she saw the awful lone longing in my lowered eyes, directed so far down at her round forehead and rudimentary hat (a band, a posy); and with one beat of her lashes: "Tant pis," she said, and made as if to move away. Perhaps only three years earlier I might have seen her coming home from school! That evocation settled the matter. She led me up the usual steep stairs, with the usual bell clearing the way for the monsieur who might not care to meet another monsieur, on the mournful climb to the abject room, all bed and bidet. As usual, she asked at once for her petit cadeau, and as usual I asked her name (Monique) and her age (eighteen). I was pretty well acquainted with the banal way of streetwalkers. They all answer "dix-huit"-- a trim twitter, a note of finality and wistful deceit which they emit up to ten times per day, the poor little creatures. But in Monique's case there could be no doubt she was, if anything, adding one or two years to her age.</div>

<div class="line_en">A propos: I have often wondered what became of those nymphets later? In this wrought-iron world of criss-cross cause and effect, could it be that the hidden throb I stole from them did not affect their future? I had possessed her -- and she never knew it. All right. But would it not tell sometime later? Had I not somehow tampered with her fate by involving her image in my voluptas? Oh, it was, and remains, a source of great and terrible wonder.</div>

<div class="line_en">This I deduced from many details of her compact, neat, curiously immature body. Having shed her clothes with fascinating rapidity, she stood for a moment partly wrapped in the dingy gauze of the window curtain listening with infantile pleasure, as pat as pat could be, to an organ-grinder in the dust-brimming courtyard below. When I examined her small hands and drew her attention to their grubby fingernails, she said with a naïve frown "Oui, ce n'est pas bien," and went to the washbasin, but I said it did not matter, did not matter at all. With her brown bobbed hair, luminous gray eyes and pale skin, she looked perfectly charming. Her hips were no bigger than those of a squatting lad; in fact, I do not hesitate to say (and indeed this is the reason why I linger gratefully in that gauze-gray room of memory with little Monique) that among the eighty or so grues I had had operate upon me, she was the only one that gave me a pang of genuine pleasure. "Il était malin, celui qui a inventé ce truc-là," she commented amiably, and got back into her clothes with the same high-style speed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是我从她小巧、干净、尚未成熟的身体上许多细微处推断出的。她脱下衣服，出其不意的快，部分身体用脏兮兮的薄窗帘裹着，带着完全象婴儿似的快乐站在那儿聆听楼下暮雾笼罩的院子里一位手风琴师的音乐。我看了看她的小手，把她的注意力引到她污黑的指甲上，她天真地皱着眉头说“是的，这太不好了，”然后跑向洗漱，但我说我并不在意，根本不在意。她褐色的头发剪得很短，灰色的眼睛充盈着光泽，皮肤苍白，看上去非常迷人。她的屁股不比蹲坐的男孩大；事实上，我毫不迟疑地说（这确实正是为什么我要充满感激地留恋记忆中和莫尼卡在一起的这间薄纱惨淡的房间的缘故），在我曾经使用过的大约八十个妓女中，唯有她给了我无限快乐的痛苦。“他是机灵鬼，发明了这玩艺，”她温煦地评论道，然后用同样快的速度钻回她的衣服里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I asked for another, more elaborate, assignment later the same evening, and she said she would meet me at the corner cafè at nine, and swore she had never posé un lapin in all her young life. We returned to the same room, and I could not help saying how very pretty she was to which she answered demurely: "Tu es bien gentil de dire ça" and then, noticing what I noticed too in the mirror reflecting our small Eden -- the dreadful grimace of clenched-teeth tenderness that distorted my mouth -- dutiful little Monique (oh, she had been a nymphet all right!) wanted to know if she should remove the layer of red from her lips avant qu'on se couche in case I planned to kiss her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我恳求那晚稍晚时再来一次，更复杂的功课，她说九点钟在咖啡店拐角处见我，并发誓她从来没失约过。我们又回到那间屋子，我不禁说道她是多么漂亮，对此她故作端庄地答道：“你的话非常可亲，”而后，她也注意到我正注视着镜子中我们的小伊甸园——咬紧牙关的爱意，狰狞的笑容，扭曲了我的嘴角——顺从的小莫尼卡（噢，她完全成了个性感少女！）想知道她是不是应该在我们睡觉前抹去她的唇膏，以备我想吻她。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Of course, I planned it. I let myself go with her more completely than I had with any young lady before, and my last vision that night of long-lashed Monique is touched up with a gaiety that I find seldom associated with any event in my humiliating, sordid, taciturn love life. She looked tremendously pleased with the bonus of fifty I gave her as she trotted out into the April night drizzle with Humbert Humbert lumbering in her narrow wake. Stopping before a window display she said with great gusto: "Je vais m'acheter des bas!" and never may I forget the way her Parisian childish lips exploded on "bas," pronouncing it with an appetite that all but changed the "a" into a brief buoyant bursting "o' as in "bot."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当然我会的。我纵情恣意，跟她在一起比以前任何女郎都尽兴，那一晚长睫毛的莫尼卡给我的最后一幅幻影，唤起了一种欢乐的精神，使我很难把它和我耻辱的、污秽而沉默的爱情生活中任何事件联系在一起。当她踱入那场四月之夜的毛毛细雨中，她看上去无比欢欣，怀着我赏她的五十法郎小费，让亨伯特．亨伯特跟在她窈窕的身影后。在一扇陈列橱窗前她停下脚步，兴致勃勃地叫道：“我要买玻璃丝长袜！”我永远也不会忘记她那种巴黎孩子发出“长袜”的的口型，读出来，带着渴望，把那个“a”音变成一个活泼的喷腔“0”，象是“长沃”。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">My brief acquaintance with her started a train of thought that may seem pretty obvious to the reader who knows the ropes. An advertisement in a lewd magazine landed me, one brave day, in the office of a Mlle Edith who began by offering me to choose a kindred soul from a collection of rather formal photographs in a rather soiled album ("Regardez-moi cette belle brune!"). When I pushed the album away and somehow managed to blurt out my criminal craving, she looked as if about to show me the door; however, after asking me what price I was prepared to disburse, she condescended to put me in touch with a person qui pourrait arranger la chose. Next day, an asthmatic woman, coarsely painted, garrulous, garlicky, with an almost farcical Provençal accent and a black mustache above a purple lip, took me to what was apparently her own domicile, and there, after explosively kissing the bunched tips of her fat fingers to signify the delectable rosebud quality of her merchandise, she theatrically drew aside a curtain to reveal what I judged was that part of the room where a large and unfastidious family usually slept. It was now empty save for a monstrously plump, sallow, repulsively plain girl of at least fifteen with red-ribboned thick black braids who sat on a chair perfunctorily nursing a bald doll. When I shook my head and tried to shuffle out of the trap, the woman, talking fast, began removing the dingy woolen jersey from the young giantess' torso; then, seeing my determination to leave, she demanded son argent. A door at the end of the room was opened, and two men who had been dining in the kitchen joined in the squabble. They were misshapen, bare-necked, very swarthy and one of them wore dark glasses. A small boy and a begrimed, bowlegged toddler lurked behind them. With the insolent logic of a nightmare, the enraged procuress, indicating the man in glasses, said he had served in the police, lui, so that I had better do as I was told. I went up to Marie -- for that was her stellar name -- who by then had quietly transferred her heavy haunches to a stool at the kitchen table and resumed her interrupted soup while the toddler picked up the doll. With a surge of pity dramatizing my idiotic gesture, I thrust a banknote into her indifferent hand. She surrendered my gift to the ex-detective, whereupon I was suffered to leave.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="同她短暂的关系，启发了我一连串的意念，熟悉内情的读者一定明白。在一个明艳的日子，一本黄色杂志上的广告引我到一位名叫米尔．埃迪特的办公室，她一上来就拿给我一本脏乎乎的影册，让我从里面颇为标致的照片中挑出一个性投意合的灵魂（“看看我这褐发美人！”）。我把影册推到一边，把罪恶的要求说出来以后，她的样子象是要告诉我门在哪儿了；然而，等问完我打算出多少钱以后，她屈尊介绍我去找能管这件事的人。第二天，来了位患气喘病的妇人，打扮俗劣，絮絮叨叨，满口臭蒜味，操着很象普罗旺斯地区口音，十分滑稽，发紫的唇上还有一撮黑胡，领我去显然是她自己的家里；突发似地吻了吻她凸起干皱的胖手指尖，为了炫耀她的货是艳如玫瑰情窦初开，她演戏似地拉开一块帘布，露出房间的一部分，我断定是一个挤将的大家庭平常睡觉的地方。现在那儿空荡荡的，只有一个肥妞，面露病黄色，令人恶心，至少十五岁了，粗黑的辫子用红绳系着，她坐在一张椅子上，敷衍地抚弄着一个秃头洋娃娃。我摇摇头，刚想闪身避开这个圈套，那女人，还在急切地说着什么，就动手脱去年轻女巨怪躯干上肮脏的毛织紧身内衣；而后，看出我要走，她立刻索要她的钱。屋角的门开了，两个刚刚从厨房吃过饭的男人也参加了这场争吵。他们都有些畸形，光着脖子，黑黝黝的，其中一人还戴副墨镜。一个小男孩和一个刚学走路的罗圈腿小脏娃儿躲在他们身后。这蛮横的鸨儿，态度极为无孔，指着那个戴眼镜的男人，说他曾经在警察局干过，就是他，所以我最好听话，这真是恶梦的逻辑。我走向玛丽——那是她主演的芳名——她已把她的笨屁股挪到了餐桌前的板凳上，又继续喝她刚才喝了半截的汤，刚学走路的小孩拣起了那个洋娃娃。一种油然而车的怜悯，戏剧性地演出了一个极愚蠢的动作，我不偏不倚朝她手里塞了一张支票。她转手把这馈赠缴给了那位前侦探，我于是痛苦地离去了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I had a date with her next day at 2.15 P. M. in my own rooms, but it was less successful, she seemed to have grown less juvenile, more of a woman overnight. A cold I caught from her led me to cancel a fourth assignment, nor was I sorry to break an emotional series that threatened to burden me with heart-rending fantasies and peter out in dull disappointment. So let her remain, sleek, slender Monique, as she was for a minute or two: a delinquent nymphet shining through the matter-of-fact young whore.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天午后两点十五分，我又和她在我的房间约会，但不如以前那么成功，一夜之间，她好象少了许多青春，多了妇人气。我从她身上传染了冷漠，这使我没再布置第四次作业；中断这次感情系列并让它在失望中渐渐消失，我也并不遗憾，它荡人心魄的狂念几欲使我受累不堪。就这样，让她还是那个光润灵透、温柔娴雅的莫尼卡吧，就象她曾经有过一分钟或两分钟的样子：一个负罪的性感少女透过实在的妓女，晶莹闪光。">查看中文翻译</div>
