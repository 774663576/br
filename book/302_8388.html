<div class="line_en">"I should be undeserving of the confidence you have honoured me with, if I felt no desire for its continuance, or no farther curiosity on itssubject. I will not apologize therefore for bringing it forward again."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Offended me! How could you suppose so? Believe me," and Elinor spokeit with the truest sincerity, "nothing could be farther from myintention than to give you such an idea. Could you have a motive forthe trust, that was not honourable and flattering to me?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"Thank you," cried Lucy warmly, "for breaking the ice; you have set myheart at ease by it; for I was somehow or other afraid I had offendedyou by what I told you that Monday."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“谢谢你打破了僵局，”露西激动地嚷道，“你这样讲就让我放心啦。不知怎么搞的，我总是担心星期一那天说话得罪了你。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"And yet I do assure you," replied Lucy, her little sharp eyes full ofmeaning, "there seemed to me to be a coldness and displeasure in yourmanner that made me quite uncomfortable. I felt sure that you wasangry with me; and have been quarrelling with myself ever since, forhaving took such a liberty as to trouble you with my affairs. But I amvery glad to find it was only my own fancy, and that you really do notblame me. If you knew what a consolation it was to me to relieve myheart speaking to you of what I am always thinking of every moment ofmy life, your compassion would make you overlook every thing else I amsure."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不过，说实在的，”露西回答说，一双敏锐的小眼睛意味深长地望着她，“你当时的态度似乎很冷淡，很不高兴，搞得我十分尴尬。我想你准是生我的气了。此后我一直在怪罪自己，不该冒昧地拿我自己的事情打扰你。不过我很高兴地发现，这只不过是我的错觉，你并没真地责怪我，说实在话，你若是知道我向你倾吐一下我无时无刻不在思量的真心话，心里觉得有多么宽慰，你就会同情我，而不计较别的东西。”">查看中文翻译</div>

If the strength of yourreciprocal attachment had failed, as between many people, and undermany circumstances it naturally would during a four years' engagement, your situation would have been pitiable, indeed."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你有这个信念，这对你是至关紧要的。毫无疑问，他对你也抱有同样的信念。万一你们相互间情淡爱弛（这是在许多人之间，许多情况下，在四年订婚期间经常发生的现象），你的境况确实会是很可怜的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He has only two thousand pounds of his own; it would be madness tomarry upon that, though for my own part, I could give up every prospectof more without a sigh. I have been always used to a very smallincome, and could struggle with any poverty for him; but I love him toowell to be the selfish means of robbing him, perhaps, of all that hismother might give him if he married to please her. We must wait, itmay be for many years. With almost every other man in the world, itwould be an alarming prospect; but Edward's affection and constancynothing can deprive me of I know."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他自己只有两千镑的收入，单靠这点钱结婚，那简直是发疯。不过就我自己来说，我可以毫无怨气地放弃更高的追求。我一直习惯于微薄的收入，为了他我可以与贫穷作斗争。但是我太爱他了，他若是娶个使他母亲中意的太太，也许会得到她的不少财产，我不想自私自利地让爱德华丧失掉这些财产。我们必须等待，也许要等许多年。对天下几乎所有的男人来说，这是个令人不寒而栗的前景。可是我知道，爱德华对我的一片深情和忠贞不渝是什么力量也剥夺不了的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Indeed, I can easily believe that it was a very great relief to you, to acknowledge your situation to me, and be assured that you shallnever have reason to repent it. Your case is a very unfortunate one; you seem to me to be surrounded with difficulties, and you will haveneed of all your mutual affection to support you under them. Mr. Ferrars, I believe, is entirely dependent on his mother."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“的确，我不难想象，你把你的处境告诉我，而且确信一辈子不用后悔，这对你真是个莫大的宽慰。你们的情况十分不幸，后来好似是困难重重，你们需要依靠相互的钟情坚持下去。我想，费拉斯先生完全依赖于他母亲。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Lucy went on. "I am rather of a jealous temper too by nature, and fromour different situations in life, from his being so much more in theworld than me, and our continual separation, I was enough inclined forsuspicion, to have found out the truth in an instant, if there had beenthe slightest alteration in his behaviour to me when we met, or anylowness of spirits that I could not account for, or if he had talkedmore of one lady than another, or seemed in any respect less happy atLongstaple than he used to be. I do not mean to say that I amparticularly observant or quick-sighted in general, but in such a caseI am sure I could not be deceived."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="露西继续往下说。“我生性也好妒忌，因为我们的生活处境不同，他比我见的世面多得多，再加上我们又长期分离，我老爱疑神疑鬼。我们见面时，哪伯他对我的态度发生一点细微的变化，他的情绪出现莫名其妙的低落现象，他对某一个女人比对别的女人谈论得多了些，他在郎斯特普尔显得不像过去那么快乐，我马上就能觉察出来。我并不是说，我的观察力一般都很敏锐，眼睛一般都很尖，但是在这种情况下，我肯定是不会受蒙骗的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我们若是能肯定她只是一时不快就好啦！可惜费拉斯太太是个刚愎自用、妄自尊大的女人，一听到这消息，发起怒来，很可能把所有财产都交给罗伯特。一想到这里，看在爱德华的份上，竟吓得我不敢草率行事。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I can answer for it that Miss Dashwood's is not," said Mrs. Jennings, laughing heartily; "for he is one of the modestest, prettiest behavedyoung men I ever saw; but as for Lucy, she is such a sly littlecreature, there is no finding out who SHE likes."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我敢担保，达什伍德小姐的心上人不是花花公子，”詹宁斯太太说着，纵情笑了。“他是我见过的最谦虚、最文雅的一个年轻人。不过，说到露西，她是个狡猾的小精怪，谁也不知道她喜欢谁。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="埃丽诺不由得羞得满脸通红。露西咬咬嘴唇，愤怒地瞪着她姐姐。两人沉默了一阵。露西首先打破了沉默，虽然玛丽安弹起了一支极其优美的协奏曲，给她们提供了有效的掩护，但她说话的声音还是压得很低：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I will honestly tell you of one scheme which has lately come into myhead, for bringing matters to bear; indeed I am bound to let you intothe secret, for you are a party concerned. I dare say you have seenenough of Edward to know that he would prefer the church to every otherprofession; now my plan is that he should take orders as soon as hecan, and then through your interest, which I am sure you would be kindenough to use out of friendship for him, and I hope out of some regardto me, your brother might be persuaded to give him Norland living; which I understand is a very good one, and the present incumbent notlikely to live a great while. That would be enough for us to marryupon, and we might trust to time and chance for the rest."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我想坦率地告诉你，我最近想到了一个切实可行的好办法。的确，我有责任让你知道这个秘密，因为事情与你有关。你常见到爱德华，一定知道他最喜欢当牧师。我的想法是这样的：他尽快地接受圣职，然后希望你能出自对他的友情和对我的关心，利用你的影响，劝说你哥哥把诺兰的牧师职位赐给他。我听说这是个很不错的职务，而且现在的牧师也活不多久了。这就可以保证我们先结婚，余下的事情再听天由命吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="埃丽诺为爱德华未婚妻的虚情假意感到脸红，她回答说：“假如我在这个问题上真有什么意见可言的话，一听到你这番恭维，准给吓得不敢开口了。你把我的声威抬举得过高了。要把一对情深意切的恋人分开，对一个局外人来说，实在是无能为力的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"'Tis because you are an indifferent person," said Lucy, with somepique, and laying a particular stress on those words, "that yourjudgment might justly have such weight with me.

<div class="line_cn" title="“说真的，你冤枉了我，”露西一本正经地答遏。“在我认识的人中，我最尊重你的意见。我的确相信，假使你对我说：‘我劝你无论如何要取消同爱德华。费拉斯的婚约，这会使你们两个更幸福。’那我就会决定马上这样做。”，">查看中文翻译</div>
