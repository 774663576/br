<div class="line_en">Philip's ideas of the life of medical students, like those of the public at large, were founded on the pictures which Charles Dickens drew in the middle of the nineteenth century. He soon discovered that Bob Sawyer, if he ever existed, was no longer at all like the medical student of the present.</div>

<div class="line_en">It is a mixed lot which enters upon the medical profession, and naturally there are some who are lazy and reckless. They think it is an easy life, idle away a couple of years; and then, because their funds come to an end or because angry parents refuse any longer to support them, drift away from the hospital. Others find the examinations too hard for them; one failure after another robs them of their nerve; and, panic-stricken, they forget as soon as they come into the forbidding buildings of the Conjoint Board the knowledge which before they had so pat. They remain year after year, objects of good-humoured scorn to younger men: some of them crawl through the examination of the Apothecaries Hall; others become non-qualified assistants, a precarious position in which they are at the mercy of their employer; their lot is poverty, drunkenness, and Heaven only knows their end. But for the most part medical students are industrious young men of the middle-class with a sufficient allowance to live in the respectable fashion they have been used to; many are the sons of doctors who have already something of the professional manner; their career is mapped out: as soon as they are qualified they propose to apply for a hospital appointment, after holding which (and perhaps a trip to the Far East as a ship's doctor), they will join their father and spend the rest of their days in a country practice. One or two are marked out as exceptionally brilliant: they will take the various prizes and scholarships which are open each year to the deserving, get one appointment after another at the hospital, go on the staff, take a consulting-room in Harley Street, and, specialising in one subject or another, become prosperous, eminent, and titled.</div>

<div class="line_en">The medical profession is the only one which a man may enter at any age with some chance of making a living. Among the men of Philip's year were three or four who were past their first youth: one had been in the Navy, from which according to report he had been dismissed for drunkenness; he was a man of thirty, with a red face, a brusque manner, and a loud voice. Another was a married man with two children, who had lost money through a defaulting solicitor; he had a bowed look as if the world were too much for him; he went about his work silently, and it was plain that he found it difficult at his age to commit facts to memory. His mind worked slowly. His effort at application was painful to see.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="恐怕只有医生这个行业是不设年龄门槛的。不管年纪多大，只要想学门挣钱糊口的手艺都可以来学。菲利普同级的人里就有两三个已经不年轻。其中一个当过海军，小道消息说，他是因为酗酒被开除的军籍。这个红脸男人三十来岁，模样凶巴巴的，嗓门很大。还有一个结了婚、生了两个孩子的男人因为律师违约，被卷走了很多钱；他驼背得厉害，好像生活的重担全都压在他肩上似的。他学习的时候总是一声不吭。也难怪，这个年纪的人想往脑子里记点东西可不是什么简单事。他的脑子已经转不动了，那副拼命死记硬背的样子让人看了难受。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Philip made himself at home in his tiny rooms. He arranged his books and hung on the walls such pictures and sketches as he possessed. Above him, on the drawing-room floor, lived a fifth-year man called Griffiths; but Philip saw little of him, partly because he was occupied chiefly in the wards and partly because he had been to Oxford. Such of the students as had been to a university kept a good deal together: they used a variety of means natural to the young in order to impress upon the less fortunate a proper sense of their inferiority; the rest of the students found their Olympian serenity rather hard to bear. Griffiths was a tall fellow, with a quantity of curly red hair and blue eyes, a white skin and a very red mouth; he was one of those fortunate people whom everybody liked, for he had high spirits and a constant gaiety. He strummed a little on the piano and sang comic songs with gusto; and evening after evening, while Philip was reading in his solitary room, he heard the shouts and the uproarious laughter of Griffiths' friends above him. He thought of those delightful evenings in Paris when they would sit in the studio, Lawson and he, Flanagan and Clutton, and talk of art and morals, the love-affairs of the present, and the fame of the future. He felt sick at heart. He found that it was easy to make a heroic gesture, but hard to abide by its results. The worst of it was that the work seemed to him very tedious. He had got out of the habit of being asked questions by demonstrators. His attention wandered at lectures. Anatomy was a dreary science, a mere matter of learning by heart an enormous number of facts; dissection bored him; he did not see the use of dissecting out laboriously nerves and arteries when with much less trouble you could see in the diagrams of a book or in the specimens of the pathological museum exactly where they were.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="菲利普在自己的小屋里过得很是自在。他把书整理妥当，又把拿来的几幅画都挂上了墙。楼上的客厅住着位在医学院里待了五年的男人，名叫格里菲斯。菲利普和他不熟，一方面是因为自己几乎一天到头都待在医院学习，另一方面则因为格里菲斯是从牛津大学毕业的。上过大学的人都喜欢拉帮结伙凑成一群，不管年纪多大都喜欢靠着年轻人才用的幼稚手段让那些运气欠佳、天资匮乏的人深感低人一等。其他人都很难忍受他们趾高气扬，架子十足的嘴脸。格里菲斯个子挺高，长了一头浓密的红色卷发和一双蓝色的眼睛，皮肤很白，嘴唇猩红。他是那种人人都喜欢的幸运儿，因为他永远都兴高采烈、嘻嘻哈哈的。喜欢偶尔漫不经心地敲着琴键，津津有味地唱上两句滑稽歌。多少个夜晚，菲利普独自一人在屋里捧着书读，总能听到楼上他和朋友们热热闹闹、大喊大笑的动静。菲利普想起了在巴黎的那些快活夜晚，他和劳森、弗拉纳根、克拉顿坐在画室里热烈讨论艺术和道德，谈论眼下谁又撞上了桃花运，不时再展望一下功成名就的光明未来。他心里忽然一阵伤感。自己当时头也不回地说走就走似乎很有英雄气概，但空摆英雄架子并不难，真正难的是要咬牙承担由此引发的后果。最糟糕的莫过于学医对他来说非常无聊。他厌倦被老师追着提问，上课也老是开小差。解剖学本来就枯燥无味，不光有一大堆需要死记硬背的知识，还有让他觉得无比乏味的解剖实验。菲利普觉得既然从书上或从病理模型陈列室里就能找到神经血管，花这么多力气解剖标本实在是一点用都没有。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was through no effort of his that he became friendly with Dunsford, the fresh-complexioned, heavy lad whose acquaintance he had made at the beginning of the session. Dunsford attached himself to Philip merely because he was the first person he had known at St. Luke's. He had no friends in London, and on Saturday nights he and Philip got into the habit of going together to the pit of a music-hall or the gallery of a theatre. He was stupid, but he was good-humoured and never took offence; he always said the obvious thing, but when Philip laughed at him merely smiled. He had a very sweet smile. Though Philip made him his butt, he liked him; he was amused by his candour and delighted with his agreeable nature: Dunsford had the charm which himself was acutely conscious of not possessing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他几乎没下什么功夫就和邓斯福熟络起来了。这个一脸阳光的大男孩从学期一开始就和菲利普认识了，他和菲利普做朋友也只是因为这是他在圣鲁克认识的第一个人。他在伦敦没有朋友，周六晚上时常和菲利普去音乐厅和歌剧院放松一下，但他们选的位置不是最后一排就是旁听席。他有些愚钝，可脾气很好从不动怒。总是说些没有营养、显而易见的事，就算遭到菲利普嘲笑，也只是一笑了之。他微笑起来很好看。别看菲利普经常拿他开涮，但其实挺喜欢他。他直言不讳的坦率常逗得菲利普开怀大笑，随和友好的个性也让菲利普颇为欣赏。菲利普明白得很，邓斯福身上有一种自己所欠缺的魅力。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He made friends by chance, but not intimate friends, for he seemed to have nothing in particular to say to his companions. When he tried to interest himself in their concerns, he felt that they found him patronising. He was not of those who can talk of what moves them without caring whether it bores or not the people they talk to. One man, hearing that he had studied art in Paris, and fancying himself on his taste, tried to discuss art with him; but Philip was impatient of views which did not agree with his own; and, finding quickly that the other's ideas were conventional, grew monosyllabic. Philip desired popularity but could bring himself to make no advances to others. A fear of rebuff prevented him from affability, and he concealed his shyness, which was still intense, under a frigid taciturnity. He was going through the same experience as he had done at school, but here the freedom of the medical students' life made it possible for him to live a good deal by himself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他偶然结交了几个朋友，可是没有一个足够亲密，因为他好像和同伴之间没有共同语言。有时也想对他们的话题表现得兴致勃勃，可总觉得在他们眼里，自己这样全像是在刻意屈尊俯就。他从不会说起自己感兴趣的话题就停不下来，而不在乎周围的人是否觉得无聊。曾经有次，一个学生听说他在巴黎学过艺术，自以为和他志趣相投，想一起坐下聊聊，但他对那些和自己意见不符的观点很不耐烦，没多久就发现对方的见解非常平庸，聊了一会儿就不欢而散了。他想让人人都喜欢自己，可又不会去主动接触别人。因为害怕遭到拒绝，所以不敢与人亲近，只好把害羞隐藏在冷若冰霜的面孔之下。现在的生活就跟读中学时一样，但是作为医学生总归多了不少自由的时间，借此机会也能好好地一个人待着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She had the small regular features, the blue eyes, and the broad low brow, which the Victorian painters, Lord Leighton, Alma Tadema, and a hundred others, induced the world they lived in to accept as a type of Greek beauty. She seemed to have a great deal of hair: it was arranged with peculiar elaboration and done over the forehead in what she called an Alexandra fringe. She was very anaemic. Her thin lips were pale, and her skin was delicate, of a faint green colour, without a touch of red even in the cheeks. She had very good teeth. She took great pains to prevent her work from spoiling her hands, and they were small, thin, and white. She went about her duties with a bored look.</div>

<div class="line_en">Philip, to please him, made one or two remarks, but she answered with monosyllables. She had taken their measure. They were boys, and she surmised they were students. She had no use for them. Dunsford noticed that a man with sandy hair and a bristly moustache, who looked like a German, was favoured with her attention whenever he came into the shop; and then it was only by calling her two or three times that they could induce her to take their order. She used the clients whom she did not know with frigid insolence, and when she was talking to a friend was perfectly indifferent to the calls of the hurried. She had the art of treating women who desired refreshment with just that degree of impertinence which irritated them without affording them an opportunity of complaining to the management. One day Dunsford told him her name was Mildred. He had heard one of the other girls in the shop address her.</div>

<div class="line_en">His influence with Dunsford was strong enough to get him to take their tea elsewhere, and Dunsford soon found another young woman to flirt with. But the snub which the waitress had inflicted on him rankled. If she had treated him with civility he would have been perfectly indifferent to her; but it was obvious that she disliked him rather than otherwise, and his pride was wounded. He could not suppress a desire to be even with her. He was impatient with himself because he had so petty a feeling, but three or four days' firmness, during which he would not go to the shop, did not help him to surmount it; and he came to the conclusion that it would be least trouble to see her. Having done so he would certainly cease to think of her. Pretexting an appointment one afternoon, for he was not a little ashamed of his weakness, he left Dunsford and went straight to the shop which he had vowed never again to enter. He saw the waitress the moment he came in and sat down at one of her tables. He expected her to make some reference to the fact that he had not been there for a week, but when she came up for his order she said nothing. He had heard her say to other customers:</div>
