<div class="line_en">From her place in the makeup chair, Tully stared at herself. It was the first time, in all her years spent in seats like this, that she'd really noticed how huge the mirrors were. No wonder it was so easy for a celebrity to get lost in her own reflection.</div>

<div class="line_en">She walked around the studio, her fiefdom, watching her employees scurry around, running to and fro to make sure everything went off without a hitch, and that was no mean feat, given that she'd called everyone at three yesterday to change the theme of today's live show. She knew that several of her producers and bookers had worked late into the night to put it together. She herself had been up until almost two in the morning, doing research. She'd faxed and e-mailed dozens of the best oncologists in the world. She'd spent hours on the phone, relaying every bit of information on Kate's case that she'd been able to glean. Every specialist said the same thing.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Welcome to The Girlfriend Hour," she said as she always did, but then something went wrong, just stopped. She looked at her audience and saw strangers.

<div class="line_en">"It's an extremely rare kind of cancer that starts not with a lump, but with a rash or a discoloration. Kate's family physician diagnosed it as a bug bite and prescribed antibiotics. Unfortunately, this happens to too many women, especially younger women. It's called inflammatory breast cancer and it can be aggressive and all too deadly. By the time Kate was diagnosed, it was already too late."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那种癌症非常罕见，开始的时候不会出现硬块，只是起疹子或发红，凯蒂的家庭医生以为只是虫咬，所以开了抗生素给她。很不幸，许多女性都有同样的遭遇，尤其是年轻女性。这种疾病叫作发炎性乳腺癌，可能具有侵略性，致死率相当高，凯蒂确认罹癌时已经太迟了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

"Dr. Hilary Carleton is here to talk about inflammatory breast cancer, and to educate you about the symptoms: the rashes, the localized heat, the discolorations, the puckered skin, and the inverted nipples, to name a few.

<div class="line_en">The show rolled forward as they all did, on the wheels of Tully's personality. She interviewed guests and showed pictures and reminded her audience of millions not only to get yearly mammograms but to watch for any changes in their breasts. At the end of her broadcast, instead of her usual We'll talk tomorrow tagline, she looked into the camera and said, "Katie, you're the best friend I have and the best mother I know. Except for Mrs. M., who is good, too." Then she smiled at her audience and said simply: "This will be my last show for a long while. I'm taking time off to be with Katie. As all of you would."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="塔莉的魅力有如承载的车轮，使得节目一如往常顺利运行。她访问来宾、播放照片，提醒百万名观众光是定期接受乳房摄影还不够，也要仔细观察乳房的变化。一般节目到了尾声时，都会以招牌金句“我们明天继续聊”作为结语，但今天她直视着镜头说：“凯蒂，你是我最好的朋友，也是我见过最好的妈妈，只有穆勒齐伯母能和你一较高下。”她对着观众微笑，简洁地说，“接下来我会离开荧光幕很长一段时间，我要请假陪凯蒂，相信你们也会这么做。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"This show is, after all, just that: a show. Real life is with friends and family, and as an old friend pointed out to me a while ago: I do have a family. And she needs me now." She unclipped her microphone, dropped it to the floor, and left the stage.</div>

<div class="line_en">On Kate's last night in the hospital, Tully convinced Johnny to take the kids home, and she took his place in the room's other bed. She pushed the bed across the linoleum floor until it practically butted up to Katie's. "I brought you a tape of my last show."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“大概十页。”塔莉没有说话，凯蒂蹙眉，“你怎么没有吵着要看？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tully heard the sadness in her friend's voice; it matched her own. The last thing she wanted to think about right now was how young they were. For years they'd teased each other about getting old. "How much have you written?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="塔莉听出好友的悲伤，呼应着她自己的心情。现在她不愿意去想她们是多么年轻，虽然这些年来她们一直打趣说对方老了，“你写了多少？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Okay," she said quietly, promising the only thing she had to give: herself. "It's a deal." She had to force a smile and both of them knew it. Some lies, it was obvious, would be unavoidable in the days ahead. "You'll need my input, of course. I was a witness to every important moment of your life. And I have a photographic memory. It's a gift. Like my ability to apply makeup and highlight hair."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好，”她低声说，承诺献上她唯一拥有的东西：她自己。“我答应你。”她的笑容很勉强，凯蒂也知道，接下来的日子显然免不了将有更多谎言，“当然你会需要我帮忙。我亲眼目睹你人生中所有重要的时刻，还过目不忘，这是种天分，就像我化妆和挑染的功力一样，是天生的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Even with self-regulated pain meds, Kate found leaving the hospital a difficult endeavor. First of all, there was the crowd: her parents, her kids and husband, her aunt and uncle, her brother, and Tully. Second, there was just so much movement -- out of bed, into the wheelchair, out of the wheelchair, into the car, out of the car, into Johnny's arms.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="即使有了可以自行调节用量的止痛药，出院对凯蒂而言依然是艰辛的大工程。第一，惊动太多人，她的父母、小孩、老公、阿姨、姨丈、弟弟和塔莉全员出动；第二，移动太多次，下床、上轮椅、下轮椅、上车、下车，被强尼抱起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

She'd meant to sound matter-of-fact, to simply acknowledge what they both knew: soon she would have trouble sitting up and the bed would help, but her voice betrayed her. "Y-you painted," she said to her husband. The last time she'd seen this room it had been barn-red with white trim and red and blue furniture -- a casual, beachy look with lots of painted antique pieces and shells in glass bowls. Now it was pale green, almost celery-colored, with rose accents. Family photos were everywhere, in white porcelain frames.</div>
