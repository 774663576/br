<div class="line_en">Montfauçon was, as Sauval says, "the most ancient and the most superb gibbet in the kingdom." Between the faubourgs of the Temple and Saint Martin, about a hundred and sixty toises from the walls of Paris, a few bow shots from La Courtille, there was to be seen on the crest of a gentle, almost imperceptible eminence, but sufficiently elevated to be seen for several leagues round about, an edifice of strange form, bearing considerable resemblance to a Celtic cromlech, and where also human sacrifices were offered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="鹰山，如索伐耳所说，是“王国最古老、最威严的绞刑台”。在圣殿关厢和圣马丁关厢之间，在巴黎城墙外大约一百六十寻的地方，距离库尔提几箭之遥，几乎不可觉察缓缓升起的小山丘——但也有足够的高度，可以在方圆几里以内看得见——的山顶上，有一座建筑，形状奇特，很像是凯尔特人的大石台（17），这里面也杀生献祭。【注：（17）凯尔特人是原始印欧人的一部分，文化遗迹遍布西欧，尚存于爱尔兰、布列塔尼等等地方的巨石垒成的平顶台是古凯尔特人的遗迹之一。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Let the reader picture to himself, crowning a limestone hillock, an oblong mass of masonry fifteen feet in height, thirty wide, forty long, with a gate, an external railing and a platform; on this platform sixteen enormous pillars of rough hewn stone, thirty feet in height, arranged in a colonnade round three of the four sides of the mass which support them, bound together at their summits by heavy beams, whence hung chains at intervals; on all these chains, skeletons; in the vicinity, on the plain, a stone cross and two gibbets of secondary importance, which seemed to have sprung up as shoots around the central gallows; above all this, in the sky, a perpetual flock of crows; that was Montfauçon.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="读者不妨想象，在一座石灰石圆丘顶上，有一座平行六面体的建筑物，高十五尺，宽三十尺，长四十尺，有一道门、一座外栏杆、一个平台；平台上有十六根粗石砌成的粗壮柱子，直立着，高三十尺，从三面环绕着支撑它们的平台，成为柱廊，柱顶之间架着结实的横梁，间隔着垂吊下铁链；这些铁链上都吊着人的骷髅；在附近的平原上，有一个石头十字架和较小的两座绞架，仿佛是从中央树桩上生长出的再生枝杈；在这一切之上，在空中始终有乌鸦盘旋着。这就是鹰山。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At the end of the fifteenth century, the formidable gibbet which dated from 1328, was already very much dilapidated; the beams were wormeaten, the chains rusted, the pillars green with mould; the layers of hewn stone were all cracked at their joints, and grass was growing on that platform which no feet touched. The monument made a horrible profile against the sky; especially at night when there was a little moonlight on those white skulls, or when the breeze of evening brushed the chains and the skeletons, and swayed all these in the darkness. The presence of this gibbet sufficed to render gloomy all the surrounding places.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="十五世纪末，建造于一三二八年的那座可怕的绞刑架，已经将近倾圮。横梁已遭虫蛀，铁链生锈，柱子上长满青苔。料石砌成的基础的接合部都已经开裂，不再有人踏上去的平台长出了青草。这座建筑衬托着蓝天，真是可憎的形象，尤其是夜里，当月色朦胧，照射着那些发白了的头颅，或者夜间寒风吹过，铁链和骷髅嚓嚓作响。阴影中一切都在动荡的时候，这座绞刑架矗立在那里，就足以使周围的一切阴风惨惨。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The mass of masonry which served as foundation to the odious edifice was hollow. A huge cellar had been constructed there, closed by an old iron grating, which was out of order, into which were cast not only the human remains, which were taken from the chains of Montfauçon, but also the bodies of all the unfortunates executed on the other permanent gibbets of Paris. To that deep charnel-house, where so many human remains and so many crimes have rotted in company, many great ones of this world, many innocent people, have contributed their bones, from Enguerrand de Marigni, the first victim, and a just man, to Admiral de Coligni, who was its last, and who was also a just man.</div>

<div class="line_en">About eighteen months or two years after the events which terminate this story, when search was made in that cavern for the body of Olivier le Daim, who had been hanged two days previously, and to whom Charles VIII. had granted the favor of being buried in Saint Laurent, in better company, they found among all those hideous carcasses two skeletons, one of which held the other in its embrace. One of these skeletons, which was that of a woman, still had a few strips of a garment which had once been white, and around her neck was to be seen a string of adrézarach beads with a little silk bag ornamented with green glass, which was open and empty. These objects were of so little value that the executioner had probably not cared for them. The other, which held this one in a close embrace, was the skeleton of a man. It was noticed that his spinal column was crooked, his head seated on his shoulder blades, and that one leg was shorter than the other. Moreover, there was no fracture of the vertebrae at the nape of the neck, and it was evident that he had not been hanged. Hence, the man to whom it had belonged had come thither and had died there. When they tried to detach the skeleton which he held in his embrace, he fell to dust.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="结束这篇故事的那些事件发生之后大约两年或者一年半，人们到鹰山地穴里来寻找奥利维埃·公鹿的尸体（他是两天以前给绞死的，查理八世恩准移尸圣洛朗，埋葬于较为善良的死者中间），发现在那些丑恶的残骸中有两具骷髅，一具以奇特的姿态搂抱着另一具。这另一具是一个女人的，身上还有白色质料袍子的碎片，脖上套着一串念珠树种子的项链，上系一个绸质小荷包，装饰着绿玻璃片，已经打开，里面空无一物。这两样东西不值什么钱，想必是刽子手并不乐意取走的。紧紧搂着她的那一具骨骼却是一个男人的。人们发现，他的脊椎骨歪斜，脑袋缩在肩胛骨里，一条腿比另一条腿短。颈椎骨上却没有破裂的痕迹，显然他不是绞死的。因此，这个人是自己来死在这里的。当人们想把他和他所拥抱的那具骨骼解脱开来的时候，他化作了尘埃。">查看中文翻译</div>
