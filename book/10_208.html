<div class="line_en">The men of the lake-town Esgaroth were mostly indoors, for the breeze was from the black East and chill, but a few were walking on the quays, and watching, as they were fond of doing, the stars shine out from the smooth patches of the lake as they opened in the sky. From their town the Lonely Mountain was mostly screened by the low hills at the far end of the lake, through a gap in which the Running River came down from the North. Only its high peak could they see in clear weather, and they looked seldom at it, for it was ominous and drear even in the light of morning. Now it was lost and gone, blotted in the dark.</div>

<div class="line_en">Roaring he swept back over the town. A hail of dark arrows leaped up and snapped and rattled on his scales and jewels, and their shafts fell back kindled by his breath burning and hissing into the lake. No fireworks you ever imagined equalled the sights that night. At the twanging of the bows and the shrilling of the trumpets the dragon's wrath blazed to its height, till he was blind and mad with it. No one had dared to give battle to him for many an age; nor would they have dared now, if it had not been for the grim-voiced man (Bard was his name), who ran to and fro cheering on the archers and urging the Master to order them to fight to the last arrow.</div>

<div class="line_en">Before long, so great was his speed, they could see him as a spark of fire rushing towards them and growing ever huger and more bright, and not the most foolish doubted that the prophecies had gone rather wrong. Still they had a little time. Every vessel in the town was filled with water, every warrior was armed, every arrow and dart was ready, and the bridge to the land was thrown down and destroyed, before the roar of Smaug's terrible approach grew loud, and the lake rippled red as fire beneath the awful beating of his wings. Amid shrieks and wailing and the shouts of men he came over them, swept towards the bridges and was foiled! The bridge was gone, and his enemies were on an island in deep water-too deep and dark and cool for his liking. If he plunged into it, a vapour and a steam would arise enough to cover all the land with a mist for days; but the lake was mightier than he, it would quench him before he could pass through.</div>

<div class="line_en">Fire leaped from thatched roofs and wooden beam-ends as he hurtled down and past and round again, though all had been drenched with water before he came. Once more water was flung by a hundred hands wherever a spark appeared. Back swirled the dragon. A sweep of his tail and the roof of the Great House crumbled and smashed down. Flames unquenchable sprang high into the night. Another swoop and another, and another house and then another sprang afire and fell; and still no arrow hindered Smaug or hurt him more than a fly from the marshes.</div>

<div class="line_en">Fire leaped from the dragon's jaws. He circled for a while high in the air above them lighting all the lake; the trees by the shores shone like copper and like blood with leaping shadows of dense black at their feet.

There was mourning and weeping, where but a little time ago the old songs of mirth to come had been sung about the dwarves. Now men cursed their names. The Master himself was turning to his great gilded boat, hoping to row away in the confusion and save himself. Soon all the town would be deserted and burned down to the surface of the lake.</div>

<div class="line_en">But there was still a company of archers that held their ground among the burning houses. Their captain was Bard, grim-voiced and grim-faced, whose friends had accused him of prophesying floods and poisoned fish, though they knew his worth and courage. He was a descendant in long line of Girion, Lord of Dale, whose wife and child had escaped down the Running River from the ruin long ago. Now he shot with a great yew bow, till all his arrows but one were spent. The flames were near him. His companions were leaving him. He bent his bow for the last time.</div>

Just now he was enjoying the sport of town-baiting more than he had enjoyed anything for years.</div>

<div class="line_en">The dragon swooped once more lower than ever, and as he turned and dived down his belly glittered white with sparkling fires of gems in the moon-but not in one place. The great bow twanged. The black arrow sped straight from the string, straight for the hollow by the left breast where the foreleg was flung wide. In it smote and vanished, barb, shaft and feather, so fierce was its flight. With a shriek that deafened men, felled trees and split stone, Smaug shot spouting into the air, turned over and crashed down from on high in ruin.</div>

<div class="line_en">The waxing moon rose higher and higher and the wind grew loud and cold. It twisted the white fog into bending pillars and hurrying clouds and drove it off to the West to scatter in tattered shreds over the marshes before Mirkwood. Then the many boats could be seen dotted dark on the surface of the lake, and down the wind came the voices of the people of Esgaroth lamenting their lost town and goods and ruined houses. But they had really much to be thankful for, had they thought of it, though it could hardly be expected that they should just then: three quarters of the people of the town had at least escaped alive; their woods and fields and pastures and cattle and most of their boats remained undamaged; and the dragon was dead.

<div class="line_en">As you see, the Master had not got his position for nothing. The result of his words was that for the moment the people quite forgot their idea of a new king, and turned their angry thoughts towards Thorin and his company. Wild and bitter words were shouted from many sides; and some of those who had before sung the old songs loudest, were now heard as loudly crying that the dwarves had stirred the dragon up against them deliberately!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大家看到了吧，镇长能得到这个位置并不是毫无理由的。他的这番话让人们暂时忘记了推举新王的主张，而是将怒气转到了索林和他的伙伴们身上。人群中有许多地方开始冒出狂热狠毒的咒骂来，有些之前把古老的颂歌唱得最大声的人，现在又同样大声地指责他们故意吵醒了恶龙来祸害长湖镇！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At length he spoke again: "This is no time for angry words, Master, or for considering weighty plans of change. There is work to do. I serve you still-though after a while I may think again of your words and go North with any that will follow me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后，他又开口说话了：“现在不是发牢骚的时候，镇长先生，也不是酝酿惊天动地的变化的时候。我们有工作要做。我依然服从您的领导，不过，或许过一阵子，我会考虑您的建议，带着愿意跟随我的人一起北上。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Fools!" said Bard. "Why waste words and wrath on those unhappy creatures? Doubtless they perished first in fire, before Smaug came to us." Then even as he was speaking, the thought came into his heart of the fabled treasure of the Mountain lying without guard or owner, and he fell suddenly silent. He thought of the Master's words, and of Dale rebuilt, and filled with golden bells, if he could but find the men.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“傻瓜！”巴德说，“为什么要把你们的言语和愤怒浪费在那些可怜家伙的身上？毫无疑问，在史矛革飞来我们这里之前，他们肯定先就葬身火海了！”话还没说完，他就想到，大山里传说中的宝藏现正处于无人看守或是无主的状态中，于是他突然打住了话头。他想到了镇长说的话，想到要重建河谷城，铸造无数的金钟，而这一切只要他能找到人手就可以办到。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Meanwhile Bard took the lead, and ordered things as he wished, though always in the Master's name, and he had a hard task to govern the people and direct the preparations for their protection and housing. Probably most of them would have perished in the winter that now hurried after autumn, if help had not been to hand. But help came swiftly; for Bard at once had speedy messengers sent up the river to the Forest to ask the aid of the King of the Elves of the Wood, and these messengers had found a host already on the move, although it was then only the third day after the fall of Smaug.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在此同时，巴德扛起了领导众人的责任，他按自己的想法对事情作出安排，尽管总是以镇长的名义，而他在管理镇民，指挥他们为防御作准备和解决住宿等方面真可谓是呕心沥血。秋天一过眼看着冬天就要来了，如果援助不能到手的话，他们之中的大部分人肯定熬不过这个冬天。但幸运的是，援助很快就来到了，因为巴德当机立断派出信使沿河进入森林，请求森林中的精灵国王给予援助。这些信使发现精灵国王率领着一支部队已经在行动了，而此时还只是史矛革死后的第三天。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then he strode off to help in the ordering of the camps and in the care of the sick and the wounded. But the Master scowled at his back as he went, and remained sitting on the ground. He thought much but said little, unless it was to call loudly for men to bring him fire and food.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后，他就走开去，忙着安排搭建帐篷和照顾伤病的工作。但镇长却在他远去时对他的背影怒目而视，依然坐在地上一动不动。他脑子里想了很多，话却没说几句，除了叫人给他带来柴火和食物。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now everywhere Bard went he found talk running like fire among the people concerning the vast treasure that was now unguarded. Men spoke of the recompense for all their harm that they would soon get from it, and wealth over and to spare with which to buy rich things from the South; and it cheered them greatly in their plight. That was as well, for the night was bitter and miserable. Shelters could be contrived for few (the Master had one) and there was little food (even the Master went short). Many took ill of wet and cold and sorrow that night, and afterwards died, who had escaped uninjured from the ruin of the town; and in the days that followed there was much sickness and great hunger.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在，巴德不管走到哪里，都发现关于那些无人看守的宝藏的话题在人们之中如星星之火般蔓延着。人们谈论说，得到财宝以后，就可以很快补偿他们所受到的损失，可以让他们拥有足够的钱从南方购买商品，这让他们在困境中大受鼓舞。这一点是很有好处的，因为夜晚对他们来说还是艰苦而又凄惨的。遮风避雨的地方很少（镇长有一个），食物也很少（连钺长也吃不饱）。许多在镇子的毁灭中毫发无伤地逃出来的人，却在那天晚上因为潮湿、寒冷和伤悲而染了病，后来竟死去了。在后来的日子里，人们经历了相当严重的疫病和一场大饥荒。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"That will be the last we shall hear of Thorin Oakenshield, I fear," said the king. "He would have done better to have remained my guest. It is an ill wind, all the same," he added, "that blows no one any good." For he too had not forgotten the legend of the wealth of Thror. So it was that Bard's messengers found him now marching with many spearmen and bowmen; and crows were gathered thick above him, for they thought that war was awakening again, such as had not been in those parts for a long age.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我想，这只怕是我们最后一次听到索林·橡木盾的消息了。”国王说，“如果他留在这边继续当我的客人，或许下场还好些。不过，没有什么风会给谁都不带来好处。”他说这话是因为他也没有忘记传说中瑟罗尔王的财富。正因为如此，巴德的信差才会遇到他率领着弓箭手和长矛兵浩浩荡荡地行进着。乌鸦们密集地聚集在他的头上，因为它们认为战火又将重新燃起，而这一带已经很久没有打过仗了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Elvenking had received news from his own messengers and from the birds that loved his folk, and already knew much of what had happened. Very great indeed was the commotion among all things with wings that dwelt on the borders of the Desolation of the Dragon. The air was filled with circling flocks, and their swift-flying messengers flew here and there across the sky. Above the borders of the Forest there was whistling, crying and piping. Far over Mirkwood tidings spread: "Smaug is dead!" Leaves rustled and startled ears were lifted. Even before the Elvenking rode forth the news had passed west right to the pinewoods of the Misty Mountains; Beorn had heard it in his wooden house, and the goblins were at council in their caves.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="精灵国王是从他自己的信使和与他子民友好的鸟类口中得到消息的，这些鸟儿早已经知道了大部分所发生的事情。在恶龙所造成的蛮荒带周围，恶龙之死在所有长翅膀的生物中都引起了很大的骚动。空中满是各种盘旋的鸟类，它们之中那些飞行迅捷的信使在空中飞来飞去传递着消息，森林边缘的上空一时间充斥着鸟儿兴奋的啁啾。“史矛革死了！”消息很快就传遍了黑森林。树叶簌簌地响着，一双双受惊的耳朵全都竖了起來。还不等精灵国王骑马出发，这些消息就已经一路向西，来到了迷雾山脉的松林之中。贝奥恩在自己的木屋中听到了这个消息，半兽人们则在洞穴中商讨起了对策。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But the king, when he received the prayers of Bard, had pity, for he was the lord of a good and kindly people; so turning his march, which had at first been direct towards the Mountain, he hastened now down the river to the Long Lake. He had not boats or rafts enough for his host, and they were forced to go the slower way by foot; but great store of goods he sent ahead by water. Still elves are light-footed, and though they were not in these days much used to the marches and the treacherous lands between the Forest and the Lake, their going was swift. Only five days after the death of the dragon they came upon the shores and looked on the ruins of the town. Their welcome was good, as may be expected, and the men and their Master were ready to make any bargain for the future in return for the Elvenking's aid.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，当精灵国王收到巴德的求援信时，起了同情之心，他毕竟还是善良种族的国王。于是，他将原先直指孤山的大军调转方向，沿河而下，往长湖进发。他没有足够的船只或木筏来装载所有的部队，许多士兵被迫以较慢的方式沿陆路步行前进，不过，他预先将许多物资通过水路运了过去。精灵们的脚程再怎么说也是很快的，虽然这些年来，他们已经不像过去一样熟悉长湖和森林之间的沼泽和险恶平原了，但他们的行军速度依然很快。在恶龙死后刚刚五天，他们就来到了湖边，眺望着长湖镇的废墟。正如预期的一样，人们十分欢迎他们的到来，镇长和人们已经准备在将来付出任何代价，以换取精灵国王现在对他们的援助。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Their plans were soon made. With the women and the children, the old and the unfit, the Master remained behind; and with him were some men of crafts and many skilled elves; and they busied themselves felling trees, and collecting the timber sent down from the Forest. Then they set about raising many huts by the shore against the oncoming winter; and also under the Master's direction they began the planning of a new town, designed more fair and large even than before, but not in the same place. They removed northward higher up the shore; for ever after they had a dread of the water where the dragon lay. He would never again return to his golden bed, but was stretched cold as stone, twisted upon the floor of the shallows. There for ages his huge bones could be seen in calm weather amid the ruined piles of the old town. But few dared to cross the cursed spot, and none dared to dive into the shivering water or recover the precious stones that fell from his rotting carcase.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们很快就制订好了重建的计划。镇长和老弱妇孺都留在了后方，工匠和许多有手艺的精灵也跟他一起留下。他们忙碌着砍伐树木，收集从森林里顺流漂下的木材，然后动手在湖边搭建许多小屋，抵御即将到来的寒冬。在镇长的指挥下，他们开始兴建一座比以前更大、更好的新镇子，只是位置不在原先的地方了。他们将城镇沿着湖岸又往北挪上去了一点，因为他们对恶龙葬身的水域从此心生畏惧。他再也回不到他那黄金睡榻上去了，只能如岩石般僵卧在冰冷的浅滩水底。此后的许多年里，每当天气晴朗，人们便能在旧镇的废墟间看见它那巨大的尸骨。很少有人胆敢越过这受诅咒的地方，更没有哪一个敢冒险潜入这令人浑身打战的水中，打捞从他那腐烂尸身上掉落下来的宝石。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But all the men of arms who were still able, and the most of the Elvenking's array, got ready to march north to the Mountain. It was thus that in eleven days from the ruin of the town the head of their host passed the rock-gates at the end of the lake and came into the desolate lands.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="其余所有还能拿起武器的成年男子，和精灵国王的大部分兵力，全都准备向北进入孤山。就这样，在长湖镇被毁之后的第十一天，其先头部队就已经越过了长湖另一端的石门，进入了恶龙盘踞多年的荒凉之地。">查看中文翻译</div>
