<div class="line_en">They had almost given up hope of ever finding Flamel in a li -- brary book, even though Harry was still sure he'd read the name somewhere. Once term had started, they were back to skimming through books for ten minutes during their breaks. Harry had even less time than the other two, because Quidditch practice had started again.</div>

<div class="line_en">Hermione, who came back the day before term started, took a different view of things.
