<div class="line_en">It's quarter to six and the first proper snowfall of the year has laid itself like a cold blanket over the slumbering community of row houses. Ove unhooks his jacket and goes outside for his daily inspection. With equal surprise and dissatisfaction, he sees the cat sitting in the snow outside his door. It seems to have been sitting there all night.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="差一刻六点。今年第一场像样的雪像一张冰冷的毯子裹住昏昏沉沉的排屋小区。欧维从衣架上取下蓝色外套，出门进行每日一次的小区巡逻，他半惊讶半沮丧地发现猫咪蹲在门前的雪地上。实际上，它看上去就像在那儿蹲了一整夜。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ove slams the front door extra hard to scare it away. Apparently it doesn't have the common sense to take fright. Instead it just sits there in the snow, licking its stomach. Utterly unconcerned. Ove doesn't like that sort of behavior in a cat. He shakes his head and plants his feet firmly on the ground. The cat gives him the briefest of glances, clearly uninterested, then goes back to licking itself. Ove waves his arms at it. The cat doesn't budge an inch.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维砰地关上大门，就为了吓唬它。但它显然没有任何被吓跑的意思，相反它就这么蹲在雪地中央舔自己的肚子。完全不害怕。欧维一点都不喜欢这只猫的习性。他摇摇头，双脚岔开，往它面前一站，像是随时会问：“你当这儿是什么地方？”猫抬起头，小脑袋也没有多大动作，就这么傲慢地看着他。欧维用手赶，猫咪不为所动。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When the cat still fails to give him any sort of acknowledgment, Ove loses his patience and, in a sweeping movement, kicks one of his clogs towards it. Looking back, he couldn't swear that it wasn't intentional. His wife would have been furious if she'd seen it, of course.</div>

<div class="line_en">It doesn't make much difference anyway. The clog flies in a smooth arc and passes a good yard and a half to the left of its intended target, before bouncing softly against the side of the shed and landing in the snow. The cat looks nonchalantly first at the clog, and then at Ove. In the end it stands up, strolls around the corner of Ove's shed, and disappears.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但其实也无所谓，猫咪还是没反应。木屐划出一道大弧线，朝猫的左侧飞行了一米半，在储藏室的墙壁上反弹了一下后，落在了雪地上。猫咪漫不经心地瞄了木屐一眼，又看看欧维，看上去也不怎么害怕，但最后它还是站起身，绕过储藏室一角不见了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ove walks through the snow in his socks to fetch the clog. He glares at it, as if he feels it should be ashamed of itself for not having a better sense of aim. Then he pulls himself together and goes on his inspection tour.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维穿着袜子穿过雪地去捡木屐。他瞪着它，就好像它应该为没有射得更准一些而自惭形秽，然后他抖擞精神，开始巡逻。不能因为他今天要死就放任那些流氓们为所欲为。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When he comes back to his house, he pushes his way through the snow and opens the door to the shed. It smells of mineral spirits and mold in there, exactly as it should in a shed. He steps over the Saab's summer tires and moves the jars of unsorted screws out of the way. Squeezes past the workbench, careful not to knock over the jars of mineral spirits with brushes in them. Lifts aside the garden chairs and the globe barbecue. Puts away the rim wrench and snatches up the snow shovel. Weighs it a bit in his hand, the way one might do with a two-handed sword. Stands there in silence, scrutinizing it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="回家以后，他蹚过积雪，打开储藏室的门。里面一股工业酒精和发霉的味道，正经储藏室就应该是这个味道。他跨过萨博的夏胎，捡起放散装螺丝刀的罐子，小心地挤过工作台，以免打翻插着刷子的工业酒精桶。挪开花园椅和洒水壶，放好扳手，一把抄起雪铲。在手里掂一掂，好像手里的不是雪铲，而是一把长柄剑。他默不作声地站在那里掂量着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ove grips the shovel, scoops up some snow, and throws it at the cat, which jumps out of the way and glares indignantly at him. Spits out a bit of snow. Snorts. Then turns around and pads off again, around the corner of Ove's shed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维抄起雪铲，朝它挥了一铲子雪，猫纵身躲开，怒目相对。从嘴里吐出点雪来，龇一龇牙，转身再次消失在欧维储藏室的拐角处。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When he comes out of the shed with the shovel, the cat is sitting in the snow again, right outside his house. Ove glares in amazement at its audacity. Its fur is thawing out, dripping. Or what remains of its fur. There are more bald patches than fur on that creature. It also has a long scar running along one eye, down across its nose. If cats have nine lives, this one is quite clearly working its way through at least the seventh or eighth of them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当他手拿雪铲走出储藏室的时候，猫又蹲在他家门口了。欧维对着它瞪大了眼睛，诚然为它的恬不知耻而感到震惊。它的皮毛上（或者说剩下的那些皮毛上）渗下融水来。这妖孽没长毛的疤比没长疤的毛多，还有一条长疤从眼睛一直通向鼻子。要是猫真有九条命，估计这只已经用了七八条。">查看中文翻译</div>

People don't shovel snow that way anymore. Nowadays they just clear a way, they use snowblowers and all sorts of things. Any old method will do, scattering snow all over the place. As if that was the only thing that mattered in life: pushing one's way forward.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维把雪铲往地上一插。他花了十五分钟清理了房子和储藏室之间的空地。活完成得很仔细，横平竖直，四四方方。人们已经不再铲雪。如今顶多也就是把路给清出来，动不动就是铲雪车什么的。不管到哪儿，铲得雪花四溅。好似这就是现在生活的意义：勇往直前。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He puts the snow shovel back in the shed and goes into the house. Puts on his good navy suit again. It will get stained and foul-smelling by the end of all this, but Ove has decided that his wife just has to go along with it, at least when he gets there.</div>

Checks that the coffee percolator is unplugged. Puts on the blue jacket over his suit, then the clogs, and goes back into the shed; he returns with a long, rolled-up plastic tube. Locks the shed and the front door, tugs three times at each door handle. Then goes down the little pathway between the houses.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他吃早饭听广播，洗掉餐具，擦干灶台。然后他在房子里转了一圈，关掉所有的暖气，熄灭所有的灯。检查咖啡壶的插头是否已经拔掉。把蓝色外套穿在西装外，套上木屐，回到储藏室，出来的时候带出一根盘着的粗塑料管。锁上储藏室的门和大门，检查三次门把手，走上房子之间的那条小路。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When he's done, he leans for a moment against the shovel in a snowdrift on the little pathway. Balances his body weight on it and watches the sun rising over the sleeping houses. He's been awake for most of the night, thinking of ways to die. He has even drawn some diagrams and charts to clarify the various methods. After carefully weighing up the pros and cons, he's accepted that what he's doing today has to be the best of bad alternatives. Admittedly he doesn't like the fact that the Saab will be left in neutral and use up a lot of expensive gas for no good reason afterwards, but it's simply a factor that he'll have to accept in order to get it done.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="完事以后，他在小路边的雪堆上支着雪铲站了片刻。倚靠着它，看着太阳从沉睡的房屋背后升起。他大半夜都醒着，思考着怎样才能稳妥地死去，甚至列起了图表来比较不同的死法。在反复权衡利弊之后，他决定今天采取最不糟糕的手段。他的确不喜欢萨博在他死后还要空烧掉许多汽油，但要达到目的必须接受这个事实。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He considers whether the paintwork of the Saab will become terribly dirty as a result of this. He supposes so. It's a pity and a shame, he realizes, but not much can be done about it. He gives the tires a couple of evaluating kicks. They're in fine order, they really are. Good for at least another three winters, he estimates, judging by his last kick. Which quickly reminds him about the letter in the inside pocket of his jacket, so he fishes it out to check whether he has remembered to leave instructions about the summer tires. Yes, he has. It's written here under "Saab + Accessories." "Summer tires in the shed," and then clear instructions that even a genuine moron could understand about where the rim bolts can be found in the trunk. Ove slides the letter back into the envelope and puts it in the inside pocket of his jacket.</div>

Opens the back electric window a couple of inches. Gets out of the car. Closes the garage door. Fixes the plastic tube tightly over the exhaust pipe. Watches the exhaust fumes slowly bubbling out of the other end of the tube. Then feeds the tube through the open back window. Gets into the car. Closes the door. Adjusts the wing mirrors. Fine-tunes the radio one step forward and one step back. Leans back in the seat. Closes his eyes. Feels the thick exhaust smoke, cubic inch by cubic inch, filling the garage and his lungs.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ove hears a banging at the garage door. Ignores it. Straightens the creases of his trousers. Looks at himself in the rearview mirror. Wonders whether perhaps he should have put on a tie. She always liked it when he wore a tie. She looked at him then as the most handsome man in the world. He wonders if she will look at him now. If she'll be ashamed of him turning up in the afterlife unemployed and wearing a dirty suit. Will she think he's an idiot who can't even hold down an honest job without being phased out, just because his knowledge has been found wanting on account of some computer? Will she still look at him the way she used to, like a man who can be relied on? A man who can take responsibility for things and fix a water heater if necessary. Will she like him as much now that he's just an old person with no purpose in the world?</div>
