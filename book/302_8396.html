<div class="line_en">When the particulars of this conversation were repeated by Miss Dashwood to her sister, as they very soon were, the effect on her was not entirely such as the former had hoped to see. Not that Marianne appeared to distrust the truth of any part of it, for she listened to it all with the most steady and submissive attention, made neither objection nor remark, attempted no vindication of Willoughby, and seemed to shew by her tears that she felt it to be impossible. But though this behaviour assured Elinor that the conviction of this guilt WAS carried home to her mind, though she saw with satisfaction the effect of it, in her no longer avoiding Colonel Brandon when he called, in her speaking to him, even voluntarily speaking, with a kind of compassionate respect, and though she saw her spirits less violently irritated than before, she did not see her less wretched. Her mind did become settled, but it was settled in a gloomy dejection. She felt the loss of Willoughby's character yet more heavily than she had felt the loss of his heart; his seduction and desertion of Miss Williams, the misery of that poor girl, and the doubt of what his designs might ONCE have been on herself, preyed altogether so much on her spirits, that she could not bring herself to speak of what she felt even to Elinor; and, brooding over her sorrows in silence, gave more pain to her sister than could have been communicated by the most open and most frequent confession of them.</div>

<div class="line_en">To give the feelings or the language of Mrs. Dashwood on receiving and answering Elinor's letter would be only to give a repetition of what her daughters had already felt and said; of a disappointment hardly less painful than Marianne's, and an indignation even greater than Elinor's. Long letters from her, quickly succeeding each other, arrived to tell all that she suffered and thought; to express her anxious solicitude for Marianne, and entreat she would bear up with fortitude under this misfortune. Bad indeed must the nature of Marianne's affliction be, when her mother could talk of fortitude! mortifying and humiliating must be the origin of those regrets, which SHE could wish her not to indulge!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="要叙说达什伍德太太在收到和回复埃丽诺来信时的心情和言语，那就只消重述一遍她的女儿们先前的心情和言语：失望的痛苦不亚于玛丽安，愤慨之心甚至胜过埃丽诺。她接二连三地写来一封封长信，告诉她们她的痛苦心情和种种想法，表示她对玛丽安的百般忧虑，恳求她在不幸之中要有坚韧不拔的精神。做母亲的都劝她要坚强，可见玛丽安悲痛到何种地步！连母亲都希望女儿不要过于悔恨，可见造成这些悔恨的事端是多么不光彩！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Against the interest of her own individual comfort, Mrs. Dashwood had determined that it would be better for Marianne to be any where, at that time, than at Barton, where every thing within her view would be bringing back the past in the strongest and most afflicting manner, by constantly placing Willoughby before her, such as she had always seen him there. She recommended it to her daughters, therefore, by all means not to shorten their visit to Mrs. Jennings; the length of which, though never exactly fixed, had been expected by all to comprise at least five or six weeks. A variety of occupations, of objects, and of company, which could not be procured at Barton, would be inevitable there, and might yet, she hoped, cheat Marianne, at times, into some interest beyond herself, and even into some amusement, much as the ideas of both might now be spurned by her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="达什伍德太太置个人的慰籍于不顾，断然决定：玛丽安目前在哪里都可以，就是别回巴顿。一回巴顿，她无论见到什么，都会想起过去，时时刻刻想着过去时常与威洛比相见的情景，结果会引起极大的悲痛，因而她劝说两位女儿千万不要缩短对詹宁斯太太的访问。她们访问的期限虽然从来没有明确说定，不过大家都期待她们至少待上五六个星期。在巴顿，一切都很单调，而在詹宁斯太太那里，却必然要遇上各种各样的活动，各种各样的事物，各种各样的朋友，她希望这有时能逗得玛丽安异乎寻常地发生几分兴趣，甚至感到几分乐趣，尽管这种想法现在可能遭到她的摈弃。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">From all danger of seeing Willoughby again, her mother considered her to be at least equally safe in town as in the country, since his acquaintance must now be dropped by all who called themselves her friends. Design could never bring them in each other's way: negligence could never leave them exposed to a surprise; and chance had less in its favour in the crowd of London than even in the retirement of Barton, where it might force him before her while paying that visit at Allenham on his marriage, which Mrs. Dashwood, from foreseeing at first as a probable event, had brought herself to expect as a certain one.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="为了避免再次遇见威洛比，她母亲认为她呆在城里至少与呆在乡下一样保险，因为凡是自称是她的朋友的那些人，现在一定都断绝了与威洛比的来往。他们决不会再有意相逢了，即使出于疏忽经包含在主词中的宾词明白地表述出来。这种判断虽具有普，也决不会不期而遇。相比之下，伦敦熙熙攘攘的，相遇的可能性更小，而巴顿由于比较僻静，说不定在他婚后乘车走访艾伦汉的时候，硬是让玛丽安撞见呢。母亲开头预见这事很有可能，后来干脆认为这是笃定无疑的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Marianne had promised to be guided by her mother's opinion, and she submitted to it therefore without opposition, though it proved perfectly different from what she wished and expected, though she felt it to be entirely wrong, formed on mistaken grounds, and that by requiring her longer continuance in London it deprived her of the only possible alleviation of her wretchedness, the personal sympathy of her mother, and doomed her to such society and such scenes as must prevent her ever knowing a moment's rest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛丽安早就答应按照母亲的意见行事，于是便老老实实地服从了，尽管这意见与她期望的大相径庭。她认为，这意见是建立在错误的基础上，实属大错特错。让她在伦敦继续呆下去，那就使她失去了减轻痛苦的唯一可能性，失去了母亲的直接同情，使她注定置身于这样的环境，专跟这种人打交道，叫她一时一刻不得安宁。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She had yet another reason for wishing her children to remain where they were; a letter from her son-in-law had told her that he and his wife were to be in town before the middle of February, and she judged it right that they should sometimes see their brother.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她希望女儿们呆在原地不动，也还有另外一个原因：约翰—达什伍德来信说，他和妻子二月中旬以前要进城，因此她觉得还是让她们有时间见见哥哥为好。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But it was a matter of great consolation to her, that what brought evil to herself would bring good to her sister; and Elinor, on the other hand, suspecting that it would not be in her power to avoid Edward entirely, comforted herself by thinking, that though their longer stay would therefore militate against her own happiness, it would be better for Marianne than an immediate return into Devonshire.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，使她感到大为欣慰的是，给她带来不幸的事情，却将给姐姐带来好处。但埃丽诺呢，她分明觉得无法完全避开爱德华阶段，即“意识”、“自我意识”、“理性”、“伦理精神”、“宗，心里却在这样安慰自己：虽然在这里多呆下去会妨碍她自己的幸福，但对玛丽安说来，这比马上回德文郡要好。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Her carefulness in guarding her sister from ever hearing Willoughby's name mentioned, was not thrown away. Marianne, though without knowing it herself, reaped all its advantage; for neither Mrs. Jennings, nor Sir John, nor even Mrs. Palmer herself, ever spoke of him before her. Elinor wished that the same forbearance could have extended towards herself, but that was impossible, and she was obliged to listen day after day to the indignation of them all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她小心翼翼地保护着妹妹，不让她听见别人提起威洛比的名字，结果她的努力没有白费。玛丽安虽说对此全然不知，却从中受益不浅；因为不论詹宁斯太太也好，约翰爵士也好，甚至帕尔默夫人也好，从未在她面前说起过威洛比。埃丽诺真巴不得他们对她自己也有这般涵养功夫，然而这是不可能的，她不得不日复一日地听着他们一个个义愤填膺地声讨威洛比。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sir John, could not have thought it possible. "A man of whom he had always had such reason to think well! Such a good-natured fellow! He did not believe there was a bolder rider in England! It was an unaccountable business. He wished him at the devil with all his heart. He would not speak another word to him, meet him where he might, for all the world! No, not if it were to be by the side of Barton covert, and they were kept watching for two hours together. Such a scoundrel of a fellow! such a deceitful dog! It was only the last time they met that he had offered him one of Folly's puppies! and this was the end of it!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="约翰爵士简直不敢相信会有这种事。“一个一向被我们看得起的人！一个如此温顺的人，我还以为英国没有一个比他更勇敢的骑手！这事真叫人莫名其妙。我真心希望他滚得远远的。我说什么也不会再跟他说一句话，见一次面，无论在哪里：不，即使在巴顿树林旁边一起呆上两个小时，我也不跟他说一句话。他竟是这么一个恶棍！这么不老实的一个无赖！我们上次见面时，我还提出送他一只富利小狗呢！现在只好不了了之！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The calm and polite unconcern of Lady Middleton on the occasion was a happy relief to Elinor's spirits, oppressed as they often were by the clamorous kindness of the others. It was a great comfort to her to be sure of exciting no interest in ONE person at least among their circle of friends: a great comfort to know that there was ONE who would meet her without feeling any curiosity after particulars, or any anxiety for her sister's health.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃丽诺经常被人们吵吵嚷嚷的好意关怀搅得心烦意乱，这时，唯有米德尔顿夫人不闻不问、客客气气的，倒使她心里感到一些慰籍。在这帮朋友中，她尽可肯定至少有—个人对她不感兴趣，这个人见到她既不想打听那些细枝末节，又不担心她妹妹的健康状况，这对她委实是个莫大的安慰。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The rest of Mrs. Palmer's sympathy was shewn in procuring all the particulars in her power of the approaching marriage, and communicating them to Elinor. She could soon tell at what coachmaker's the new carriage was building, by what painter Mr. Willoughby's portrait was drawn, and at what warehouse Miss Grey's clothes might be seen.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mrs. Palmer, in her way, was equally angry. "She was determined to drop his acquaintance immediately, and she was very thankful that she had never been acquainted with him at all.

<div class="line_en">Lady Middleton expressed her sense of the affair about once every day, or twice, if the subject occurred very often, by saying, "It is very shocking, indeed!" and by the means of this continual though gentle vent, was able not only to see the Miss Dashwoods from the first without the smallest emotion, but very soon to see them without recollecting a word of the matter; and having thus supported the dignity of her own sex, and spoken her decided censure of what was wrong in the other, she thought herself at liberty to attend to the interest of her own assemblies, and therefore determined (though rather against the opinion of Sir John) that as Mrs. Willoughby would at once be a woman of elegance and fortune, to leave her card with her as soon as she married.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果这件事经常被人提起，米德尔顿夫人每天也要表示一两次看法，说上一声：“真叫人震惊！”通过这种持续而文雅的表态，她不仅看到达什伍德家两位小姐从开头起就无动于衷，而且很快发现她们也只字不再提起此事。她如此这般地维护了她们女性的尊严，毫不含糊地指责了男性的过失之后，便觉得自己可以关心一下她的聚会了，于是决定（虽说违背了约翰爵士的意愿）：既然威洛比夫人马上要成为一个高雅阔绰的女人，她要等她一结婚，就向她送去名片。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Colonel Brandon's delicate, unobtrusive enquiries were never unwelcome to Miss Dashwood. He had abundantly earned the privilege of intimate discussion of her sister's disappointment, by the friendly zeal with which he had endeavoured to soften it, and they always conversed with confidence. His chief reward for the painful exertion of disclosing past sorrows and present humiliations, was given in the pitying eye with which Marianne sometimes observed him, and the gentleness of her voice whenever (though it did not often happen) she was obliged, or could oblige herself to speak to him. THESE assured him that his exertion had produced an increase of good-will towards himself, and THESE gave Elinor hopes of its being farther augmented hereafter; but Mrs. Jennings, who knew nothing of all this, who knew only that the Colonel continued as grave as ever, and that she could neither prevail on him to make the offer himself, nor commission her to make it for him, began, at the end of two days, to think that, instead of Midsummer, they would not be married till Michaelmas, and by the end of a week that it would not be a match at all. The good understanding between the Colonel and Miss Dashwood seemed rather to declare that the honours of the mulberry-tree, the canal, and the yew arbour, would all be made over to HER; and Mrs. Jennings had, for some time ceased to think at all of Mrs. Ferrars.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布兰登上校体贴而谨慎的问候从不使达什伍德小姐感到厌烦。他一心一意地想减轻她妹妹的泪丧情绪，因而充分赢得了与她亲切交谈此事的特权，两人谈起来总是那样推心置腹。他沉痛地倾吐了他自己的旧怨新耻，得到的主要根答是，玛丽安有时常同情的目光望着他，而且每当（虽然并不常见）她被迫或主动同他说话时，语气总是那样温和。这些举动使他确信，他的努力增加了玛丽安对他的好感，而且给埃丽诺带来了希望，认为这好感今后还会进一步加深。然而詹宁斯太太对此一无所知，她只晓得上校仍然像以往那样郁郁寡欢，只晓得她绝对无法劝说他亲自出面求婚，他也绝对不会委托她代为说合。因此过了两天便开始琢磨：他们在夏至前是结不了婚啦，非得到米迦勒节不可。但过了一周之后，她又在思谋：这门婚事压根儿就办不成。上校和达什伍德小姐之间的情投意合似乎表明，享受那桑树、河渠和老紫杉树荫地的艳福要让给她了。一时间，詹宁斯太太竟然把费拉斯先生忘得一干二净。">查看中文翻译</div>
