<div class="line_en">Oh, what does it matter? It's not like I was going to win the Games anyway. Who cares what they do to me? What really scares me is what they might do to my mother and Prim, how my family might suffer now because of my impulsiveness. Will they take their few belongings, or send my mother to prison and Prim to the community home, or kill them? They wouldn't kill them, would they? Why not? What do they care?</div>

<div class="line_en">As I stride toward the elevator, I fling my bow to one side and my quiver to the other. I brush past the gaping Avoxes who guard the elevators and hit the number twelve button with my fist. The doors slide together and I zip upward. I actually make it back to my floor before the tears start running down my cheeks. I can hear the others calling me from the sitting room, but I fly down the hall into my room, bolt the door, and fling myself onto my bed. Then I really begin to sob.</div>

<div class="line_en">Now I've done it! Now I've ruined everything! If I'd stood even a ghost of a chance, it vanished when I sent that arrow flying at the Gamemakers. What will they do to me now? Arrest me? Execute me? Cut my tongue and turn me into an Avox so I can wait on the future tributes of Panem? What was I thinking, shooting at the Gamemakers? Of course, I wasn't, I was shooting at that apple because I was so angry at being ignored. I wasn't trying to kill one of them. If I were, they'd be dead!</div>

<div class="line_en">Before that though, they'll give me a score so low, no one in their right mind would sponsor me. That's what will happen tonight. Since the training isn't open to viewers, the Gamemakers announce a score for each player. It gives the audience a starting place for the betting that will continue throughout the Games. The number, which is between one and twelve, one being irredeemably bad and twelve being unattainably high, signifies the promise of the tribute. The mark is not a guarantee of which person will win. It's only an indication of the potential a tribute showed in training. Often, because of the variables in the actual arena, high-scoring tributes go down almost immediately. And a few years ago, the boy who won the Games only received a three. Still, the scores can help or hurt an individual tribute in terms of sponsorship. I had been hoping my shooting skills might get me a six or a seven, even if I'm not particularly powerful. Now I'm sure I'll have the lowest score of the twenty-four. If no one sponsors me, my odds of staying alive decrease to almost zero.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是在我还没进竞技场之前，大赛组织者准定给我打很低的分数，成绩今晚就公布，这样所有头脑健全的人都不会资助我。今天的训练是不公开的，在训练结束后，大赛组织者将宣布每个选手成绩，观众会以此为起点在随后的整个比赛中下注。他们所给出的成绩从一分到十二分不等，一分是无可挽回的低分，十二分是高分，表明选手具有相当潜力。然而，成绩本身并不表明谁在比赛中能赢，只表明选手在训练中的潜力。在竞技场中选手表现差距很大，高分选手往往游戏一开始成绩就急转直下。几年前，一个获胜的选手在首次评比中只得了三分。当然，分数的高低也会在拉赞助方面对选手造成很大影响。虽然我的射箭技术差强人意，可开始我还指望能得到六、七分，现在我的成绩准是二十四个人中最低的。如果在比赛中没人赞助我，那我的生存几率几乎为零。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At first, I expect guards to come for me. But as time passes, it seems less likely. I calm down. They still need a girl tribute from District 12, don't they?

You can bet they'll make sure I don't have a bow and arrow to defend myself.</div>

<div class="line_en">At dawn, I lie in bed for a while, watching the sun come up on a beautiful morning. It's Sunday. A day off at home. I wonder if Gale is in the woods yet. Usually we devote all of Sunday to stocking up for the week. Rising early, hunting and gathering, then trading at the Hob. I think of Gale without me. Both of us can hunt alone, but we're better as a pair. Particularly if we're trying for bigger game. But also in the littler things, having a partner lightened the load, could even make the arduous task of filling my family's table enjoyable.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="清晨，我躺在床上，看着太阳在这个美丽的早晨慢慢升起。今天是星期天。在家是休息日。我纳闷盖尔这会儿是不是已经到了林子里。通常整个星期天我们都会为下一星期打食。一大早起床，捕猎、摘野菜野果，然后到市场去交换。我想象着我不在时盖尔一个人怎么捕猎。其实我们两个人都能单独捕猎，只不过一起干更好些，特别是捕捉大个头的猎物时。可就算捕捉小猎物，有人帮着扛那些沉甸甸的东西也挺好，这样的话，给家人四处谋食这样的苦差事也就成了轻松快乐的事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I had been struggling along on my own for about six months when I first ran into Gale in the woods. It was a Sunday in October, the air cool and pungent with dying things. I'd spent the morning competing with the squirrels for nuts and the slightly warmer afternoon wading in shallow ponds harvesting katniss. The only meat I'd shot was a squirrel that had practically run over my toes in its quest for acorns, but the animals would still be afoot when the snow buried my other food sources. Having strayed farther afield than usual, I was hurrying back home, lugging my burlap sacks, when I came across a dead rabbit. It was hanging by its neck in a thin wire a foot above my head. About fifteen yards away was another. I recognized the twitch-up snares because my father had used them. When the prey is caught, it's yanked into the air out of the reach of other hungry animals. I'd been trying to use snares all summer with no success, so I couldn't help dropping my sacks to examine this one. My fingers were just on the wire above one of the rabbits when a voice rang out. "That's dangerous."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我第一次遇见盖尔是我在林中独自打猎的六个月之后，那时我为了找吃的可费了不少力气。那是十月的一个星期天，天气凉爽，空气中飘着一股烂树叶的味道。整整一个上午，我都忙着和松鼠争夺坚果，下午趁着有点暖意，我下到浅泥塘里挖“凯特尼斯”。我打到的唯一的肉食就是一只从我脚上跑过、想找坚果吃的松鼠。不管怎么说，我先不能捕捉猎物，因为大雪会把我其他食物埋住，而动物总还要四处活动的。那天我比平时走得稍远一点，因而回家的时候急匆匆的。我正拖着麻袋走，突然看到一只死兔子，那只兔子被一个细绳吊着，就在我头顶一英尺的地方。大约十五码外还吊着另一只。我认出来这是一种圈套，我爸爸曾用过这个。猎物被逮着以后，就被吊在空中，以防别的饥饿动物来吃。我一个夏天都在试着摆弄这种圈套，却没有弄成。所以我禁不住把麻袋扔下，仔细琢磨起这东西。我的手刚要碰到兔子上方的细线时，有人喊起来：“危险！”">查看中文翻译</div>

He was only fourteen, but he cleared six feet and was as good as an adult to me. I'd seen him around the Seam and at school. And one other time. He'd lost his father in the same blast that killed mine. In January, I'd stood by while he received his medal of valor in the Justice Building, another oldest child with no father. I remembered his two little brothers clutching his mother, a woman whose swollen belly announced she was just days away from giving birth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我一惊之下，向后退了好几步，这时盖尔从树后头钻了出来。他肯定一直在盯着我。他只有十四岁，可足有六英尺高，在我看来就是个大人。我曾在“夹缝地带”和学校里见过他。让爸爸丧命的那次矿井爆炸同样也夺去了他爸爸的性命。一月份，他去领英勇奖章的时候，我就站在他身边，又是一个失去爸爸的长子。我记得他的两个弟弟搂着他妈妈，他妈妈当时腆着大肚子，眼瞅着就要生了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I shot it." I pulled my bow off my shoulder. I was still using the small version my father had made me, but I'd been practicing with the full-size one when I could. I was hoping that by spring I might be able to bring down some bigger game.</div>

<div class="line_en">We talked hunting then. I told him I might be able to get him a bow if he had something to trade. Not food. I wanted knowledge. I wanted to set my own snares that caught a belt of fat rabbits in one day. He agreed something might be worked out. As the seasons went by, we grudgingly began to share our knowledge, our weapons, our secret places that were thick with wild plums or turkeys. He taught me snares and fishing. I showed him what plants to eat and eventually gave him one of our precious bows. And then one day, without either of us saying it, we became a team. Dividing the work and the spoils. Making sure that both our families had food.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们聊起了打猎的事，我说如果他愿意跟我交换，我也可以给他弄把弓；不是拿吃的交换，而是拿他的知识换。我想自己设套，好有一天也能逮到挂满一腰带的兔子，他也答应了。时间一点点流逝，我们渐渐把自己知道的都告诉对方，在哪可以找到好多李子，哪里火鸡经常出没，我们还共用手里的家伙。他教会我下套和捕鱼。我告诉他哪些植物能吃，最后给了他一把我视若珍宝的弓。终于有一天，不言而喻，我们成了好伙伴。有难同当，有福同享，让两家的饭桌上都有饭吃。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Gale gave me a sense of security I'd lacked since my father's death. His companionship replaced the long solitary hours in the woods. I became a much better hunter when I didn't have to look over my shoulder constantly, when someone was watching my back. But he turned into so much more than a hunting partner. He became my confidant, someone with whom I could share thoughts I could never voice inside the fence. In exchange, he trusted me with his. Being out in the woods with Gale… sometimes I was actually happy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="盖尔让我有种安全感，这是自爸爸去世后就不再有的。他和我做伴，我一个人在林中漫长而孤寂的日子也就到了头。我不用再担心背后有人在盯着我，打起猎来也顺手多了。他还不仅仅是打猎的伴儿，也是我的知心朋友，在十二区不敢说的事，我都会对他一吐为快；他对我也报以同样的信任。在林子里，和盖尔一起，我时时觉得很快乐。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I can't help comparing what I have with Gale to what I'm pretending to have with Peeta. How I never question Gale's motives while I do nothing but doubt the latter's.
