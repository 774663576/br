<div class="line_cn" title="“亚历克和简是他们的进攻主力，”他平淡地说，好像只是在讨论一支篮球队一样。“他们的防御队员很少有什么大动作。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes. In a way, he is the antidote to Jane. She makes you feel the worst pain imaginable. Alec, on the other hand, makes you feel nothing. Absolutely nothing. Sometimes, when the Volturi are feeling kind, they have Alec anesthetize someone before he is executed. If he has surrendered or pleased them in some other way."</div>

<div class="line_en">"That would make him only equally as dangerous as Jane," Edward went on in the same detached voice, "in that they both can incapacitate you, make you into a helpless target. The difference between them is like the difference between Aro and me. Aro hears the mind of only one person at a time. Jane can only hurt the one object of her focus. I can hear everyone at the same time."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这就足以使他和简一样危险了，”爱德华用继续用那种仿佛与他无关的语气说道，“他们两个的能力都足以让你束手无策，变成个等死的靶子。他们两个的区别就和我与阿罗间的区别差不多，阿罗一次只能听取一个人的思想，简也一次只能攻击一个目标。而我可以同时听取所有人的思想。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes," he said. "If he uses his gift against us, we will all stand blind and deaf until they get around to killing us -- maybe they'll simply burn us without bothering to tear us apart first. Oh, we could try to fight, but we'll be more likely to hurt one another than we would be to hurt one of them."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“对。”他说。“如果他用他的能力来对付我们，我们将又聋又瞎地等着被他们杀掉——也许他们根本就懒得分别一个个杀我们，就干脆一把火都烧了。当然那时我们也可以尝试战斗，但比起打倒他们，我们更可能打到自己人。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"He's been with the Volturi for centuries," Edward cut me off, his voice abruptly panicked. He was probably seeing the same image in his head that I was: the Cullens standing helpless, senseless pillars on the killing field -- all but me. I'd be the only one who could fight. "Yes, you're surely immune to his power, but you are still a newborn, Bella. I can't make you that strong a fighter in a few weeks. I'm sure he's had training."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他为沃尔图里效力已经几个世纪了，”爱德华打断我，他的声音突然惊慌起来。他大概已经猜到了我所想的画面：卡伦一家无助地站着，等着被杀掉——除了我。我将是唯一一个还能战斗的人。“是的，他的能力对你不起作用，但你仍然是个新生儿，贝拉。我不可能在几星期里就把你训练成一个好打手。而且我肯定亚历克是接受过训练的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

I tried to think of another situation where my thick skull would give me an advantage. I didn't know enough about what the others did. Obviously, fighters like the huge Felix were beyond me.

<div class="line_en">I nodded. I would keep my plans to myself, then. First Alec and then, if I was miraculously lucky enough to win, Jane. If I could only even things out -- remove the Volturi's overwhelming offensive advantage. Maybe then there was a chance… My mind raced ahead. What if I was able to distract or even take them out? Honestly, why would either Jane or Alec ever have needed to learn battle skills? I couldn't imagine petulant little Jane surrendering her advantage, even to learn.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我点头。但其实还是在心里盘算我的计划。首先是亚历克，然后，也许我人品爆发地能够赢过简。这样局势就基本扯平了——将沃尔图里那几乎不可战胜的进攻优势给消除了，这时我们就有机会可以…。我的脑袋飞速运转着思考。如果我真能打乱他们甚至能够引开他们的话会怎样？而且实在的说，为什么简和亚历克一定要去学那些什么战术呢？我无法想象我们的小简会这样侮辱自己拥有的能力，而去学习别的东西。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Edward's face was softer now -- he smiled a little. "Eleazar is a very gentle person. He wasn't entirely happy with the Volturi, but he respected the law and its need to be upheld. He felt he was working toward the greater good. He doesn't regret his time with them. But when he found Carmen, he found his place in this world. They are very similar people, both very compassionate for vampires." He smiled again. "They met Tanya and her sisters, and they never looked back. They are well suited to this lifestyle. If they'd never found Tanya, I imagine they would have eventually discovered a way to live without human blood on their own."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱德华的表情现在稍微缓和了些——小小地微笑了一下。“以利亚撒是个非常温和的人。他和沃尔图里他们一起时并不怎么高兴，但他还是遵守他们的规矩，也认为那值得被维护。他曾经觉得自己是在为一项伟大的事业工作，而且并不后悔和他们一起。但是在找到卡门以后，他才真正找到自己在世界上的位置。他们是非常相似的人，都在吸血鬼里算是非常有同情心的。”他又微笑了一下。“他们后来又见到了坦尼娅和她的姐妹们，自那之后他们就一直生活在一起。他们都对这种生活方式非常适应。我想，就算没有遇到坦尼娅一家，他们自己也会另找到一种不依靠人血的生活方式的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jacob must have asked the obvious follow-up question.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="显然，雅各布接下来又问了一个问题。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He has an instinctive feel for the gifts of others -- the extra abilities that some vampires have," Edward told him. "He could give Aro a general idea of what any given vampire was capable of just by being in proximity with him or her. This was helpful when the Volturi went into battle. He could warn them if someone in the opposing coven had a skill that might give them some trouble. That was rare; it takes quite a skill to even inconvenience the Volturi for a moment. More often, the warning would give Aro the chance to save someone who might be useful to him. Eleazar's gift works even with humans, to an extent. He has to really concentrate with humans, though, because the latent ability is so nebulous. Aro would have him test the people who wanted to join, to see if they had any potential. Aro was sorry to see him go."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他能够探知到其他人的天赋——部分吸血鬼具有的特殊能力，”爱德华回答他。“他只用稍稍靠近别人就能大致地告诉阿罗他或她的天赋。这对沃尔图里战斗时是非常有用的，如果对方阵营里有可能构成威胁的对手时他就会提醒他们，虽然这种情况很少，因为毕竟要能对沃尔图里构成威胁，那肯定是很了不起的能力。更多的时候，他的能力是使阿罗能及时救出他觉得对自己有用的人。以利亚撒的能力甚至可以扩展到在人类身上，虽然这需要他非常非常的集中精神才可以，因为人类的天赋显现的非常模糊。所以阿罗还拿他来测试那些想要加入他们的人类，看他们有没有值得一用的潜力。为此，阿罗对以利亚撒的离开十分遗憾。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"If Irina had not come so soon," Edward mused, "we could have avoided all of this. Renesmee grows at an unprecedented rate. By the time the month is past, she'll have gained another half year of development."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“如果伊琳娜没有这么快来，”爱德华沉思道，“我们可能已经避免了现在的一切。蕾妮斯梅正以始料不及地速度成长着，她满月的时候就和其他半岁的孩子一样大了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm not dangerous at all," Renesmee interjected. I listened to her high, clear voice with new ears, imagining how she sounded to the others. "I never hurt Grandpa or Sue or Billy. I love humans. And wolf-people like my Jacob." She dropped Edward's hand to reach back and pat Jacob's arm.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我一点都不危险，”蕾妮斯梅强调道。我用我的吸血鬼新耳朵听着她尖细清脆的嗓音，想象着这在别人耳朵里这是怎样一种美妙的旋律。“我从没有伤害过外公或苏或比利。我喜欢人类，也喜欢雅各布那样的狼人们。”她说着松开爱德华的手去抓住雅各布的胳膊。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, that is something we can certainly witness," Carmen said in a decided tone. "We'll be able to promise that we've seen her mature ourselves. How could the Volturi ignore such evidence?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好吧，这是我们绝对能够证明的，”卡门用一种已经决定了的语气说道。“我们能保证已经亲眼看到了她的理智。沃尔图里怎么会忽视这样确切的证据呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Eleazar mumbled, "How, indeed?" but he did not look up, and he continued pacing as if he were paying no attention at all.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was like it had been with Charlie, and before that with all the Cullens. Renesmee was irresistible. What was it about her that drew everyone to her, that made them willing even to pledge their lives in her defense?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就像对查理一样，在查理之前还有卡伦一家，蕾妮斯梅好像有着极大地诱惑力，让每个人都无法抗拒，她这种能吸引身边每个人的魅力到底是什么，能够让大家不惜生命来保护她？">查看中文翻译</div>
