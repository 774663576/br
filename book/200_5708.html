<div class="line_en">"Hasn't anyone told you? This was my parents' house," said Sirius. "But I'm the last Black left, so it's mine now. I offered it to Dumbledore for Headquarters -- about the only useful thing I've been able to do."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“是啊，我亲爱的好妈妈。”小天狼星说，“一个月来，我们一直想把她弄下来，但她似乎在帆布后面念了一个永久粘贴咒。我们下楼去吧，快点儿，别等他们又醒过来。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But what's a portrait of your mother doing here?" Harry asked, bewildered, as they went through the door from the hall and led the way down a flight of narrow stone steps, the others just behind them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可是你母亲的肖像放在这里做什么？”哈利疑惑地问，这时他们已经穿过那扇门出了门厅，正顺着一道狭窄的石头台阶往下走，其他人都跟在后面。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry, who had expected a better welcome, noted how hard and bitter Sirius's voice sounded. He followed his godfather to the bottom of the steps and through a door leading into the basement kitchen.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was scarcely less gloomy than the hall above, a cavernous room with rough stone walls. Most of the light was coming from a large fire at the far end of the room. A haze of pipe smoke hung in the air like battle fumes, through which loomed the menacing shapes of heavy iron pots and pans hanging from the dark ceiling. Many chairs had been crammed into the room for the meeting and a long wooden table stood in the middle of them, littered with rolls of parchment, goblets, empty wine bottles, and a heap of what appeared to be rags. Mr. Weasley and his eldest son Bill were talking quietly with their heads together at the end of the table.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这里几乎和上面的门厅里一样昏暗，一个洞穴般幽深的房间，四周是粗糙的石头墙壁。大部分光线都来自房间那头的一个大壁炉。管子里冒出的烟雾弥漫在空气中，如同战场上的硝烟，黑乎乎的天花板上挂下来的沉甸甸的铁锅铁盆，在烟雾中显得面目狰狞，阴森可怖。因为开会，房问里摆满了许多椅子，中间是一张长长的木头桌子，桌上散乱地放着羊皮纸卷、高脚酒杯、空酒瓶和一堆看上去像是破布的东西。韦斯莱先生和他的长子比尔坐在桌子那一头，脑袋凑在一起小声说着什么。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“没关系，亲爱的。”韦斯莱夫人说，声音显得有点恼火。她一挥魔杖，把羊皮纸修复好了。韦斯莱夫人念咒时闪过一道亮光，哈利瞥见那纸上好像是一座建筑物的平面图。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="蒙顿格斯局促不安地在几个口袋里摸索着，但眼睛仍然盯着哈利，最后他掏出一个满是污垢的黑烟斗。他把烟斗塞进嘴里，用魔杖把它点燃，深深地吸了一口。几秒钟后，大股大股泛着绿色的烟雾就把他包围了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry, Sirius and Mundungus looked around and, within a split second, they had dived away from the table. Fred and George had bewitched a large cauldron of stew, an iron flagon of Butterbeer, and a heavy wooden breadboard, complete with knife, to hurtle through the air towards them. The stew skidded the length of the table and came to a halt just before the end, leaving a long black burn on the wooden surface; the flagon of Butterbeer fell with a crash, spilling its contents everywhere; the bread knife slipped off the board and landed, point down and quivering ominously, exactly where Sirius's right hand had been seconds before.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你说到点子上了。”卢平说，“既然魔法部坚持说用不着担心伏地魔，我们就很难让人们相信他回来了，特别是在人们其实也不愿意相信这个事实的情况下。还有，魔法部一直在对《预言家日报》施加压力，不让他们报道有关的任何消息，他们现在称这些消息为邓布利多的谣言，因此，巫师界的大部分人都完全不知道有事情发生了，这样他们很容易成为食死徒的攻击目标，如果食死徒使用夺魂咒的话。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It's no laughing matter," said Mr. Weasley sharply. "If he carries on defying the Ministry like this he could end up in Azkaban, and the last thing we want is to have Dumbledore locked up. While You-Know-Who knows Dumbledore's out there and wise to what he's up to he's going to go cautiously. If Dumbledore's out of the way -- well, You-Know-Who will have a clear field."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这不是什么好笑的事情。”韦斯莱先生严厉地说，“如果他一直这样公然与魔法部对着于，最后他可能会被关进阿兹卡班的，而我们最不希望看到的就是邓布利多被关起来。既然神秘人知道邓布利多在哪里并且清楚他打算做什么，他就必须谨慎行事。如果邓布利多被清除了——唉，神秘人就可以肆意妄为了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"They're trying to discredit him," said Lupin. "Didn't you see the Daily Prophet last week? They reported that he'd been voted out of the Chairmanship of the International Confederation of Wizards because he's getting old and losing his grip, but it's not true; he was voted out by Ministry wizards after he made a speech announcing Voldemort's return. They've demoted him from Chief Warlock on the Wizengamot -- that's the Wizard High Court -- and they're talking about taking away his Order of Merlin, First Class, too."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他们拼命想败坏他的名声，”卢平说，“你没看上个星期的《预言家日报》吗？他们报道说他的国际魔法师联合会主席的职位丢了，因为他已经年迈，力不从心，但那根本不是事实。他发表了一篇讲话，宣布伏地魔回来了，之后魔法部的巫师们就投票使他落选了。他们给他降了级，他不再是威森加摩——就是最高巫师法庭——的首席魔法师，他们还在讨论收回他的梅林爵士团一级勋章。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"But if Voldemort's trying to recruit more Death Eaters it's bound to get out that he's come back, isn't it?" asked Harry desperately.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“但是，如果伏地魔想吸收更多的人成为食死徒，他回来的消息肯定会传出去的，是不是？”哈利急躁地问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What's he after apart from followers?" Harry asked swiftly. He thought he saw Sirius and Lupin exchange the most fleeting of looks before Sirius answered, "Stuff he can only get by stealth."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“除了追随者以外，他还想得到什么呢？”哈利反应敏捷地问。他仿佛看到小天狼星和卢平飞快地交换了一下目光，然后小天狼星才做出了回答。“某种只有偷偷摸摸才能得到的东西。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Voldemort doesn't march up to people's houses and bang on their front doors, Harry," said Sirius. "He tricks, jinxes and blackmails them. He's well-practised at operating in secret. In any case, gathering followers is only one thing he's interested in. He's got other plans too, plans he can put into operation very quietly indeed, and he's concentrating on those for the moment."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“伏地魔并不是大摇大摆地走到别人家门口，砰砰地敲他们的门，哈利，”小天狼星说，“他对他们施魔法，念恶咒，威逼利诱。他搞秘密活动是很有一套的。不管怎么说，网罗追随者只是他感兴趣的事情之一。他还有其他计划，他可以神不知鬼不觉地实施的计划，眼下他的全部注意力都在那上面。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When Harry continued to look puzzled, Sirius said, "Like a weapon. Something he didn't have last time."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="看到哈利还是一脸的迷惑，小天狼星说：“比如一件武器。他上次所没有的东西。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Like what kind of weapon?" said Harry. "Something worse than the Avada Kedavra --?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Mrs. Weasley spoke from the shadows beside the door. Harry hadn't noticed her return from taking Ginny upstairs. Her arms were crossed and she looked furious.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Watch me," snarled Mrs. Weasley. She was trembling slightly as she looked at Sirius. "You've given Harry plenty of information. Any more and you might just as well induct him into the Order straightaway."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你小心点儿！”韦斯莱夫人吼道。她身体微微颤抖，望着小天狼星。“你告诉哈利的情况够多的了。再说下去，你就可以马上吸收他加入凤凰社了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sirius half-shrugged but did not argue. Mrs. Weasley beckoned imperiously to her sons and Herrnione. One by one they stood up and Harry, recognising defeat, followed suit.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="小天狼星微微耸了耸肩膀，但没有再说什么。韦斯莱夫人盛气凌人地招呼着她的几个儿子和赫敏。他们一个接一个地站起身，哈利看到没什么希望了，也只好跟着站了起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"The Order is comprised only of overage wizards," he said. "Wizards who have left school," he added, as Fred and George opened their mouths. "There are dangers involved of which you can have no idea, any of you… I think Molly's right, Sirius. We've said enough."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“凤凰社的成员只能是达到一定年龄的巫师。”他说。“已经从学校毕业的巫师。”他看到弗雷德和乔治张嘴想要说什么，便又补充说，“这里头有很多危险，你们根本就不可能知道，你们谁也不知道，我认为莫丽说得对，小天狼星。我们说得够多的了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
