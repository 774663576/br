<div class="line_en">Now, though, thrashing in the frigid water of Bernini's fountain, Langdon knew he was a long way from the Harvard pool. He was fighting not for a game, but for his life. This was the second time they had battled. No referees here. No rematches. The arms driving his face toward the bottom of the basin thrust with a force that left no doubt that it intended to kill.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="而此刻，在贝尼尼的寒冷喷泉裡不断踢水，兰登知道这跟哈佛游泳池差得可远了。现在他不是为一场比赛而战，而是为自己的生死而战。这是双方第二回交手。没有裁判，也没有复赛。那两隻手臂把他的脸往池底猛压，力量之大无疑是要置他于死地。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As a water polo player, Robert Langdon had endured more than his fair share of underwater battles. The competitive savagery that raged beneath the surface of a water polo pool, away from the eyes of the referees, could rival even the ugliest wrestling match. Langdon had been kicked, scratched, held, and even bitten once by a frustrated defenseman from whom Langdon had continuously twisted away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="身为一名水球选手，罗柏．兰登经历过太多水中打斗。在水球泳池的水面下，裁判看不到的地方，会出现种种好斗的野蛮小动作，比起最粗暴的摔角比赛毫不逊色。兰登曾经被踢、被抓伤、被拉住不放，甚至有回因为兰登不断甩开一个防守球员，那人最后气急败坏得乾脆咬他一口。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Langdon instinctively spun like a torpedo. Break the hold! But the grip torqued him back, his attacker enjoying an advantage no water polo defenseman ever had -- two feet on solid ground. Langdon contorted, trying to get his own feet beneath him. The Hassassin seemed to be favoring one arm… but nonetheless, his grip held firm.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登本能地像个鱼雷般急转开。挣脱这隻手！可是那隻箝住的手把他硬扭了回来，他的攻击者享受著其他水球防守选手所不可能有的优势──两脚踩在结实的地上。兰登扭动著，想让自己双脚站直。哈撒辛似乎比较喜欢用一隻手……而且他箝得可真紧。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The sudden switch in direction seemed to take the Hassassin off guard. Langdon's lateral motion dragged his captor's arms sideways, compromising his balance. The man's grip faltered, and Langdon kicked again. The sensation felt like a towline had snapped. Suddenly Langdon was free. Blowing the stale air from his lungs, Langdon clawed for the surface. A single breath was all he got. With crashing force the Hassassin was on top of him again, palms on his shoulders, all of his weight bearing down. Langdon scrambled to plant his feet beneath him but the Hassassin's leg swung out, cutting Langdon down.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个突然的转向似乎让哈撒辛猝不及防，兰登的横向动作把对方的双臂拖得歪了一边，失去了平衡。那两隻紧箝的手变鬆了，兰登又踢水。感觉上就好像一条拖曳船的绳索断了，忽然间，兰登自由了。他把肺裡积压已久的气吐出来，划著水衝上水面。但只吸了一口气，哈撒辛又带著压倒性的力量当头罩下，双手按住他的肩膀，全身重量往下压。兰登挣扎著想站稳脚，但哈撒辛的腿挥过来，把兰登双腿扫开。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He went under again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他又再度下沉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Langdon's muscles burned as he twisted beneath the water. This time his maneuvers were in vain. Through the bubbling water, Langdon scanned the bottom, looking for the gun. Everything was blurred. The bubbles were denser here. A blinding light flashed in his face as the killer wrestled him deeper, toward a submerged spotlight bolted on the floor of the fountain. Langdon reached out, grabbing the canister. It was hot. Langdon tried to pull himself free, but the contraption was mounted on hinges and pivoted in his hand. His leverage was instantly lost.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登往水下扭转，全身肌肉灼痛。这回他的计策徒劳无功。在冒著气泡的水中，兰登扫视池底，想找那把手枪。一切都好模糊，这裡的气泡更密了。杀手使劲把他压得更深时，一道眩目的光照到他脸上，原来他头底下就是一盏拴在喷泉底部的泛光灯。兰登伸手抓住那个灯罩，是热的。兰登想把自己拉过去好脱身，但灯罩拴在铰链上，从他手裡滑走。他一下子失去了平衡。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was then that Langdon knew he was not coming up. He did the only thing he could think of to do. He stopped trying to surface. If you can't go north, go east. Marshalling the last of his strength, Langdon dolphin-kicked his legs and pulled his arms beneath him in an awkward butterfly stroke. His body lurched forward.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在这个时候，兰登明白自己无法再往上了。于是他做了脑中唯一想到能做的事。他放弃往上。如果不能往北，就改往东。鼓起最后一丝力气，兰登的双腿开始蝶腰打水，同时双臂往下做了个笨拙的蝶式划水动作。然后身体往旁边一拐。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Only a few feet away, Cardinal Baggia felt his soul straining to leave his body. Although he had prepared for this moment his entire life, he had never imagined the end would be like this. His physical shell was in agony… burned, bruised, and held underwater by an immovable weight. He reminded himself that this suffering was nothing compared to what Jesus had endured.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="才几迟外，巴吉亚枢机主教觉得自己的灵魂正要挣脱身体。虽然他毕生都等著这一刻到来，但从没想到结局会是如此。他的肉体躯壳充满痛苦……烧伤、瘀伤，还被无法移动的重物压在水裡。他提醒自己，这些痛苦比起基督所曾承受的，实在算不上什麽。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He died for my sins…</div>

<div class="line_en">It was then Langdon saw it. Poking out from under the coins directly beneath his face. A narrow, black cylinder. The silencer of Olivetti's gun! Langdon reached out, but as his fingers wrapped around the cylinder, he did not feel metal, he felt plastic. When he pulled, the flexible rubber hose came flopping toward him like a flimsy snake. It was about two feet long with a jet of bubbles surging from the end. Langdon had not found the gun at all. It was one of the fountain's many harmlessspumanti… bubble makers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此时兰登看到了那个东西，就从他脸部下方的硬币底下伸出来。一根窄窄的、黑色的圆管子。欧里维提那把枪的灭音器！兰登伸手，但他手指握住那根管子时，却发现那不是金属，而是塑胶。他往回拉，那根有弹性的塑胶管像隻胆小的蛇般，朝他胡乱扭动。管子长约二迟，一端不断喷出气泡。兰登根本没找到枪，那根管子是喷泉底部众多毫无杀伤力的打气管之一。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Baggia could hear the thrashing of a battle raging nearby. He could not bear the thought of it. His captor was about to extinguish yet another life… the man with kind eyes, the man who had tried to help.</div>

<div class="line_en">Releasing all fear and doubt, Baggia opened his mouth and expelled what he knew would be his final breath. He watched his spirit gurgle heavenward in a burst of transparent bubbles. Then, reflexively, he gasped. The water poured in like icy daggers to his sides. The pain lasted only a few seconds.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一切恐惧和怀疑离他而去，巴吉亚张嘴吐出一口气，心知这是最后一次了。他看见他的灵魂在一阵透明的气泡中汩汩朝天空浮去。然后，出自反射动作，他猛吸了口气。水灌进他体内，像冰凉的匕首刺入他身体两侧。痛苦只持续了几秒钟。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Suddenly Langdon's body went rigid. He began to shake wildly.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Hassassin ignored the burning in his foot and focused on the drowning American, whom he now held pinned beneath him in the churning water. Finish it fully. He tightened his grip, knowingthis time Robert Langdon would not survive. As he predicted, his victim's struggling became weaker and weaker.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈撒辛没理会脚上的剧痛，专注在那个溺水的美国人身上，把他紧紧按在翻腾的水底下。我要彻底把他收拾掉。哈撒辛的手箝得更紧，知道这回罗柏．兰登活不成了。一如哈撒辛的预期，兰登的挣扎变得愈来愈微弱。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then, exactly as the Hassassin expected, his victim went suddenly flaccid. Like a great deflating balloon, Robert Langdon fell limp. It was over. The Hassassin held him down for another thirty seconds to let the water flood all of his pulmonary tissue. Gradually, he felt Langdon's body sink, on its own accord, to the bottom. Finally, the Hassassin let go. The media would find a double surprise in the Fountain of the Four Rivers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后，一如哈撒辛的预期，他的被害人忽然鬆垮下来。就像一个洩了气的大气球般，罗柏．兰登全身鬆软无力。结束了。哈撒辛继续按著他三十秒，好让池水透进他的肺部组织。他感觉到兰登的身体缓缓自行下沉，沉入池底。最后，哈撒辛放手了。媒体会在四河喷泉裡发现双重惊喜。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They lasted six.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="结果是六秒。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Tabban!"the Hassassin swore, clambering out of the fountain and looking at his bleeding toe. The tip of his boot was shredded, and the front of his big toe had been sheared off. Angry at his own carelessness, he tore the cuff from his pant leg and rammed the fabric into the toe of his boot. Pain shot up his leg."Ibn al-kalb!" He clenched his fists and rammed the cloth deeper. The bleeding slowed until it was only a trickle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="「该死！」哈撒辛用阿拉伯语诅咒道，爬出了喷泉，看著自己流血的脚趾。他的靴尖破了，大拇趾前半截没了。他很气自己这麽不小心，从裤管边缘撕下一块布，塞进靴尖的脚趾裡。忽然一股剧痛。「狗娘养的！」他握紧双拳用阿拉伯语骂道，把那块布塞得更紧。流血减缓了，到最后只剩一丝细流。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Turning his thoughts from pain to pleasure, the Hassassin got into his van. His work in Rome was done. He knew exactly what would soothe his discomfort. Vittoria Vetra was bound and waiting. The Hassassin, even cold and wet, felt himself stiffen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈撒辛上了厢型车，思绪从痛苦转为愉悦。罗马的任务完成了，他很清楚该用什麽来抚慰自己的不适。薇多利雅．威特拉正被绑在那裡等他回去。儘管又冷又溼，哈撒辛却觉得自己硬了起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Across town Vittoria awoke in pain. She was on her back. All of her muscles felt like stone. Tight. Brittle. Her arms hurt. When she tried to move, she felt spasms in her shoulders. It took her a moment to comprehend her hands were tied behind her back. Her initial reaction was confusion. Am I dreaming? But when she tried to lift her head, the pain at the base of her skull informed her of her wakefulness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在罗马城的另一端，薇多利雅在痛苦中醒来。她背朝下躺著，觉得全身肌肉像石头般，又紧又脆，手臂好痛。她想移动，却觉得双肩一阵抽搐。她花了好一会儿，才意识到自己两手绑在背后。她的第一个反应是困惑。我在作梦吗？可是当她想抬起头，脑壳基部的那股痛却提醒她，这一切不是梦。">查看中文翻译</div>
