<div class="line_en">School started. The second grade was as bad as the first, only worse -- they still flashed cards at you and wouldn't let you read or write. Miss Caroline's progress next door could be estimated by the frequency of laughter; however, the usual crew had flunked the first grade again, and were helpful in keeping order. The only thing good about the second grade was that this year I had to stay as late as Jem, and we usually walked home together at three o'clock.</div>

<div class="line_en">Jem stayed moody and silent for a week. As Atticus had once advised me to do, I tried to climb into Jem's skin and walk around in it: if I had gone alone to the Radley Place at two in the morning, my funeral would have been held the next afternoon. So I left Jem alone and tried not to bother him.</div>

When I went back --" Jem took a deep breath. "When I went back, they were folded across the fence… like they were expectin' me."</div>

<div class="line_en">We went home. Next morning the twine was where we had left it. When it was still there on the third day, Jem pocketed it. From then on, we considered everything we found in the knot-hole our property. -</div>

<div class="line_en">The second grade was grim, but Jem assured me that the older I got the better school would be, that he started off the same way, and it was not until one reached the sixth grade that one learned anything of value. The sixth grade seemed to please him from the beginning: he went through a brief Egyptian Period that baffled me -- he tried to walk flat a great deal, sticking one arm in front of him and one in back of him, putting one foot behind the other. He declared Egyptians walked that way; I said if they did I didn't see how they got anything done, but Jem said they accomplished more than the Americans ever did, they invented toilet paper and perpetual embalming, and asked where would we be today if they hadn't? Atticus told me to delete the adjectives and I'd have the facts.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="二年级实在没味。但杰姆告诉我年龄越大，上学越有意思。他说他也是这样开始的，还说要到六年级才真正学习有价值的东西。六年级好象一开始就使他高兴：他经过了使我迷惑不解的简短的“埃及阶段”——他花了很大工夫学习走得平稳一些。手脚总是一前一后。他说埃及人就是这样走路的。我说这样走路又怎么样，没看见他们做出什么了不起的事。可杰姆说他们比美国人取得的成就多得多，他们发明了手纸并用香料使尸体永不腐烂。杰姆问我要是没有他们的发明，我们会有今天这样的成就吗？阿迪克斯说过，删去些形容词，剩下的就是事实。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There are no clearly defined seasons in South Alabama; summer drifts into autumn, and autumn is sometimes never followed by winter, but turns to a days-old spring that melts into summer again. That fall was a long one, hardly cool enough for a light jacket. Jem and I were trotting in our orbit one mild October afternoon when our knot-hole stopped us again. Something white was inside this time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="亚拉巴马南部的四个季节没有明显的界线。夏季很快进入秋季，而秋天之后，有时并没有冬天而是转入寿命只有几天时问的春天，然后又混进夏天。那年的秋天持续了很久，气候温暖，几乎没凉到要穿甲克衫。十月的一天下午，天气不冷不热，杰姆和我正在我们常走的路上匆匆走着，突然那树节洞又把我们吸引住了。这次，有样白色的东西在里边。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He held them down to me. They were almost perfect miniatures of two children. The boy had on shorts, and a shock of soapy hair fell to his eyebrows. I looked up at Jem. A point of straight brown hair kicked downwards from his part. I had never noticed it before.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他把人像递给我。这是两个几乎挑不出毛病的小孩像。男孩穿着短裤，一堆乱蓬蓬的头发一直垂到眉毛上。我抬头看看杰姆，他那直愣愣的棕色头发从中间分开，向下耷拉着。我在这以前从没注意过他的头发。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jem let me do the honors: I pulled out two small images carved in soap. One was the figure of a boy, the other wore a crude dress. Before I remembered that there was no such thing as hoo-dooing, I shrieked and threw them down.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杰姆这次让我去拿：我抽出来两个用肥皂雕的小小的人像。一个是男孩，另一个是女孩，穿着一件很粗糙的衣服。我尖Ⅱq一声，把人像扔到地上，可一下又想起世上并没有什么不祥之物。">查看中文翻译</div>
