<div class="line_en">The weather continued much the same all the following morning; and the same loneliness, and the same melancholy, seemed to reign at Hartfield -- but in the afternoon it cleared; the wind changed into a softer quarter; the clouds were carried off; the sun appeared; it was summer again. With all the eagerness which such a transition gives, Emma resolved to be out of doors as soon as possible. Never had the exquisite sight, smell, sensation of nature, tranquil, warm, and brilliant after a storm, been more attractive to her. She longed for the serenity they might gradually introduce; and on Mr. Perry's coming in soon after dinner, with a disengaged hour to give her father, she lost no time ill hurrying into the shrubbery.-- There, with spirits freshened, and thoughts a little relieved, she had taken a few turns, when she saw Mr. Knightley passing through the garden door, and coming towards her.-- It was the first intimation of his being returned from London. She had been thinking of him the moment before, as unquestionably sixteen miles distant.-- There was time only for the quickest arrangement of mind. She must be collected and calm. In half a minute they were together. The "How d'ye do's" were quiet and constrained on each side. She asked after their mutual friends; they were all well.-- When had he left them?-- Only that morning. He must have had a wet ride.-- Yes.-- He meant to walk with her, she found. "He had just looked into the dining-room, and as he was not wanted there, preferred being out of doors."-- She thought he neither looked nor spoke cheerfully; and the first possible cause for it, suggested by her fears, was, that he had perhaps been communicating his plans to his brother, and was pained by the manner in which they had been received.</div>

<div class="line_en">They walked together. He was silent. She thought he was often looking at her, and trying for a fuller view of her face than it suited her to give. And this belief produced another dread. Perhaps he wanted to speak to her, of his attachment to Harriet; he might be watching for encouragement to begin.-- She did not, could not, feel equal to lead the way to any such subject. He must do it all himself. Yet she could not bear this silence. With him it was most unnatural. She considered -- resolved -- and, trying to smile, began --</div>

My blindness to what was going on, led me to act by them in a way that I must always be ashamed of, and I was very foolishly tempted to say and do many things which may well lay me open to unpleasant conjectures, but I have no other reason to regret that I was not in the secret earlier."</div>

<div class="line_en">He listened in perfect silence. She wished him to speak, but he would not. She supposed she must say more before she were entitled to his clemency; but it was a hard case to be obliged still to lower herself in his opinion. She went on, however.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Mr. Knightley," said Emma, trying to be lively, but really confused -- "I am in a very extraordinary situation. I cannot let you continue in your error; and yet, perhaps, since my manners gave such an impression, I have as much reason to be ashamed of confessing that I never have been at all attached to the person we are speaking of, as it might be natural for a woman to feel in confessing exactly the reverse.-- But I never have."</div>

<div class="line_en">"I have very little to say for my own conduct.-- I was tempted by his attentions, and allowed myself to appear pleased.-- An old story, probably -- a common case -- and no more than has happened to hundreds of my sex before; and yet it may not be the more excusable in one who sets up as I do for Understanding. Many circumstances assisted the temptation. He was the son of Mr. Weston -- he was continually here -- I always found him very pleasant -- and, in short, for (with a sigh) let me swell out the causes ever so ingeniously, they all centre in this at last -- my vanity was flattered, and I allowed his attentions. Latterly, however -- for some time, indeed -- I have had no idea of their meaning any thing.-- I thought them a habit, a trick, nothing that called for seriousness on my side. He has imposed on me, but he has not injured me. I have never been attached to him. And now I can tolerably comprehend his behaviour. He never wished to attach me. It was merely a blind to conceal his real situation with another.-- It was his object to blind all about him; and no one, I am sure, could be more effectually blinded than myself -- except that I was not blinded -- that it was my good fortune -- that, in short, I was somehow or other safe from him."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我对自己的行为没有什么好说的。我让他的献殷勤给迷惑住了，显出一副很得意的样子。这也许是老掉牙的事——平平常常的事——只不是成百上千的女人都有的事。然而，这种事出在一个自以为很有头脑的人身上，那就没有什么好原谅的。有好多情况促使我受到了。他是韦斯顿先生的儿子——经常在这儿——我总觉得他很讨人喜欢——总而言之，”说着叹了口气，“我把理由说得再怎么动听，最后还要集中到这一点——他迎合了我的虚荣心，我就任他向我献殷勤。可是，到了后来——确实有一段时间——我觉得他那样做并没有什么意思。我认为他是出于习惯，是耍花招，我用不着去当真。他欺骗了我，但是没有伤害我。我从来没有爱过他。现在，我总算可以理解他的行。他从来没有想讨我喜欢。他不过是为了遮人耳目，想掩饰他跟另一个人的真实关系。他的意图是要遮掩周围所有人的耳目，我敢肯定，谁也不像我那样容易受蒙骗——不过，我还是没有受骗——那是我的运气——总之，不管怎么说，我没上他的当。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She had hoped for an answer here -- for a few words to say that her conduct was at least intelligible; but he was silent; and, as far as she could judge, deep in thought. At last, and tolerably in his usual tone, he said,</div>

<div class="line_en">"He is a most fortunate man!" returned Mr. Knightley, with energy. "So early in life -- at three-and-twenty -- a period when, if a man chuses a wife, he generally chuses ill. At three-and-twenty to have drawn such a prize! What years of felicity that man, in all human calculation, has before him!-- Assured of the love of such a woman -- the disinterested love, for Jane Fairfax's character vouches for her disinterestedness; every thing in his favour,-- equality of situation -- I mean, as far as regards society, and all the habits and manners that are important; equality in every point but one -- and that one, since the purity of her heart is not to be doubted, such as must increase his felicity, for it will be his to bestow the only advantages she wants.-- A man would always wish to give a woman a better home than the one he takes her from; and he who can do it, where there is no doubt of her regard, must, I think, be the happiest of mortals.-- Frank Churchill is, indeed, the favourite of fortune. Every thing turns out for his good.-- He meets with a young woman at a watering-place, gains her affection, cannot even weary her by negligent treatment -- and had he and all his family sought round the world for a perfect wife for him, they could not have found her superior.-- His aunt is in the way.-- His aunt dies.-- He has only to speak.-- His friends are eager to promote his happiness.-- He had used every body ill -- and they are all delighted to forgive him.-- He is a fortunate man indeed!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他这个人太有福气啦！”奈特利先生起劲地答道。“这么年轻——才二十三岁——一个人在这样的年龄选择妻子，一般都选不好。二十三岁就选中了这么一个好妻子啊！人们尽可以想象，这个人一辈子会得多么幸福啊！他有这样一个女人爱他——纯真无私的爱，因为简·费尔法克斯有那样的性情，确保了她的纯真无私。一切都对他有利。境况相当——我是指出身和主要的习惯与举止。他们俩处处都旗鼓相当，除了一点以外——而那一点，由于她的心地无疑是纯洁的，必定会使他更加幸福，因为她唯一的不足之处将由他来弥补。男人总希望给妻子安排一个比她娘家更好的家。只要女方一片真心，但凡能做到这一点的男人，我想一定是天下最快活的人。弗兰克·邱吉尔的确是命运的宠儿，事事都很如意。他在海滨遇到一位姑娘，赢得了她的喜爱，甚至连怠慢都没使她厌倦——哪怕他和他家里人跑遍全世界要他找一个十全十美的妻子，也找不到一个比她更强的。他的舅妈阻挠他，可是已经去世了。他只要开口说一声，他的朋友都愿促成他的幸福。他对不起每～个人——而大家都乐意原谅他。他真是个有福气的人！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Emma was almost ready to sink under the agitation of this moment. The dread of being awakened from the happiest dream, was perhaps the most prominent feeling.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I cannot make speeches, Emma:" he soon resumed; and in a tone of such sincere, decided, intelligible tenderness as was tolerably convincing.--"If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more. But you know what I am.-- You hear nothing but truth from me.-- I have blamed you, and lectured you, and you have borne it as no other woman in England would have borne it.-- Bear with the truths I would tell you now, dearest Emma, as well as you have borne with them. The manner, perhaps, may have as little to recommend them. God knows, I have been a very indifferent lover.-- But you understand me.-- Yes, you see, you understand my feelings -- and will return them if you can. At present, I ask only to hear, once to hear your voice."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不善于辞令，爱玛，”奈特利先生随即又说话了，口气中带着明显的、真挚的、毫不含糊的柔情，听起来不容怀疑。“如果我不是这么爱你，也许还能多说一些。可是你了解我是怎样一个人。我对你说的都是真话。我责备过你，教训过你，要是换一个别的女人，谁也不会像你那样忍受下来。最亲爱的爱玛，我现在要跟你讲的实话，你就像以前那样忍受下来吧。从我的态度看，你也许不大相信我的是实话。天知道，我是个不露声色的情人。不过你了解我。是的，你知道，你了解我的情意——如果可能的话，还会报答我这情意。眼下，我只想再听听，再听一次你的声音。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">While he spoke, Emma's mind was most busy, and, with all the wonderful velocity of thought, had been able -- and yet without losing a word -- to catch and comprehend the exact truth of the whole; to see that Harriet's hopes had been entirely groundless, a mistake, a delusion, as complete a delusion as any of her own -- that Harriet was nothing; that she was every thing herself; that what she had been saying relative to Harriet had been all taken as the language of her own feelings; and that her agitation, her doubts, her reluctance, her discouragement, had been all received as discouragement from herself.-- And not only was there time for these convictions, with all their glow of attendant happiness; there was time also to rejoice that Harriet's secret had not escaped her, and to resolve that it need not, and should not.-- It was all the service she could now render her poor friend; for as to any of that heroism of sentiment which might have prompted her to entreat him to transfer his affection from herself to Harriet, as infinitely the most worthy of the two -- or even the more simple sublimity of resolving to refuse him at once and for ever, without vouchsafing any motive, because he could not marry them both, Emma had it not. She felt for Harriet, with pain and with contrition; but no flight of generosity run mad, opposing all that could be probable or reasonable, entered her brain. She had led her friend astray, and it would be a reproach to her for ever; but her judgment was as strong as her feelings, and as strong as it had ever been before, in reprobating any such alliance for him, as most unequal and degrading. Her way was clear, though not quite smooth.-- She spoke then, on being so entreated.-- What did she say?-- Just what she ought, of course. A lady always does.-- She said enough to shew there need not be despair -- and to invite him to say more himself. He had despaired at one period; he had received such an injunction to caution and silence, as for the time crushed every hope;-- she had begun by refusing to hear him.-- The change had perhaps been somewhat sudden;-- her proposal of taking another turn, her renewing the conversation which she had just put an end to, might be a little extraordinary!-- She felt its inconsistency; but Mr. Knightley was so obliging as to put up with it, and seek no farther explanation.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他说话的时候，爱玛的脑子在转个不停，但尽避她的思路转得奇快，她还是能够——而且一字不漏地——抓住并领悟那全部的真情，发觉哈丽特所抱的希望毫无根据，仅仅是个误会，是个错觉，跟她自己犯的错误一样，完全是个错觉——他心里根本没有哈丽特，而只有她爱玛。她所说的有关哈丽特的话，全都被理解成她自己心灵的语言。她的激动，她的疑虑，她的勉强，她的沮丧，全都被理解成发自她内心的沮丧。她不仅来得及认识到这一切，心里伴随着一股暖融融的甜蜜感，而且还能庆幸自己没把哈丽特的秘密泄露出去，她断定这秘密不必泄露，也不该泄露。现在，她对她那可怜的朋友，只能做到这个分上了，因为她没有那种侠义心肠，可以激励她央求奈特利先生不要爱她，而去爱哈丽特，哈丽特比她合适得多——她也没有那种比较纯朴的崇高精神，下定决心干脆拒绝他了事，也不说明任何理由，仅仅因为他不能娶她们两个，她爱玛就不能嫁给他。她同情哈丽特，感到又痛心又懊悔。但是，她没有慷慨到头脑发热的地步，完全置可能性和合理性于不顾。她把她的朋友引入了歧途，她将永远为此责备自己。但是，无论在感情上，还是在理智上，她都一如既往地坚决反对他娶哈丽特这样的人作妻子，认为他们一点都不般配，只能降低他的身份。她的道路是明确的，虽然并非平平坦坦。经不住对方一再恳求，她终于说话了。说了些什么呢？当然是该说的话。女人总是这样。她向他表明没有必要失望——还要他再说．说。刚才他还真是失望过，对方叫他小心不要开口，一时间使他万念俱灰。爱玛刚开始时还不肯听他说话。这次的变化也许有些突然。她提议再兜一圈，重新扯起了被她打断的话题，这也许真有点异乎寻常！她觉得这样做有些前后矛盾，可奈特利先生却挺能包涵的，没叫她再解释。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Seldom, very seldom, does complete truth belong to any human disclosure; seldom can it happen that something is not a little disguised, or a little mistaken; but where, as in this case, though the conduct is mistaken, the feelings are not, it may not be very material.-- Mr. Knightley could not impute to Emma a more relenting heart than she possessed, or a heart more disposed to accept of his.</div>

<div class="line_en">He had, in fact, been wholly unsuspicious of his own influence. He had followed her into the shrubbery with no idea of trying it. He had come, in his anxiety to see how she bore Frank Churchill's engagement, with no selfish view, no view at all, but of endeavouring, if she allowed him an opening, to soothe or to counsel her.-- The rest had been the work of the moment, the immediate effect of what he heard, on his feelings. The delightful assurance of her total indifference towards Frank Churchill, of her having a heart completely disengaged from him, had given birth to the hope, that, in time, he might gain her affection himself;-- but it had been no present hope -- he had only, in the momentary conquest of eagerness over judgment, aspired to be told that she did not forbid his attempt to attach her.-- The superior hopes which gradually opened were so much the more enchanting.-- The affection, which he had been asking to be allowed to create, if he could, was already his!-- Within half an hour, he had passed from a thoroughly distressed state of mind, to something so like perfect happiness, that it could bear no other name.</div>

<div class="line_en">Her change was equal.-- This one half-hour had given to each the same precious certainty of being beloved, had cleared from each the same degree of ignorance, jealousy, or distrust.-- On his side, there had been a long-standing jealousy, old as the arrival, or even the expectation, of Frank Churchill.-- He had been in love with Emma, and jealous of Frank Churchill, from about the same period, one sentiment having probably enlightened him as to the other. It was his jealousy of Frank Churchill that had taken him from the country.-- The Box Hill party had decided him on going away. He would save himself from witnessing again such permitted, encouraged attentions.-- He had gone to learn to be indifferent.-- But he had gone to a wrong place. There was too much domestic happiness in his brother's house; woman wore too amiable a form in it; Isabella was too much like Emma -- differing only in those striking inferiorities, which always brought the other in brilliancy before him, for much to have been done, even had his time been longer.-- He had stayed on, however, vigorously, day after day -- till this very morning's post had conveyed the history of Jane Fairfax.-- Then, with the gladness which must be felt, nay, which he did not scruple to feel, having never believed Frank Churchill to be at all deserving Emma, was there so much fond solicitude, so much keen anxiety for her, that he could stay no longer. He had ridden home through the rain; and had walked up directly after dinner, to see how this sweetest and best of all creatures, faultless in spite of all her faults, bore the discovery.</div>
