<div class="line_en">At that time, my heart was totally convinced by the romantic and sacred law of marriage in Ireland. The book told me that Ireland believes in Catholicism and prohibited divorce. Therefore, when a couple gets married, they are supposed to choose the time of their marriage which ranges from 1 year to 100 years. The most impressive of this law of marriage lies in the inverse relationship between the time of marriage and the fees to be charged. If you choose 1 year for your marriage, you shall pay as much as 2,000 sterling pounds plus receiving a dictionary-thick reference of rights and responsibilities. But if you choose 100 years, then you are very lucky and only need to pay 0.5 pound for the fees and receive a short but heart-touching note in all women's eyes: "I have no idea the clear rights and responsibilities for my left hand to my right hand, my right leg to my left leg, my left eye to my right eye and my right sphere of brain to the left. Actually, they are an integrated whole and live by each other and cheer for each other. Finally, I would like this pink note to convey my best wishes to your one-hundred-year marriage! May you live happily all your lives!"</div>

<div class="line_en">When I was having a chit-chat with my colleague, she asked me all of a sudden, "How did your husband propose to you at that time? Was it romantic?" I was numbed by her words for a while, and then burst into laughter, "My husband is a bit rigid, so do you think his proposal would be romantic?" Though I said in that way, I felt very sweet in heart when thinking of my husband's proposing to me. To be honest, his proposal was actually by no means romantic without flowers, diamond ring and any other surprise. It was even could not be called "marriage proposal".</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="和同事闲谈时，她突然问我：“你老公当时是怎样向你求婚的？浪漫吗？”我当即一愣，随后大笑道：“我老公有点古板呢，你觉得他的求婚会浪漫吗？”虽然我这么说，但回想起我丈夫的求婚，心里还是甜滋滋的。老实说，他的求婚一点都不浪漫，没有鲜花，没有钻戒，没有任何惊喜，甚至都算不上是种“求婚”。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At that time, he gave me a book about Ireland, which, now I am thinking was a long-established plan. At the weekend when I finished the book, he came to me and asked me whether I had finished the book. Seeing me nod my head, he felt very pleased and said to me in a low but happy voice, "If you like, we can get married in an Irish way!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当时，他给了我一本有关爱尔兰的书，现在回想起来，我会觉得他其实预谋已久。周末我看完书后，他来问我是否看完，我点点头，他就很高兴，用一种低沉的口吻说道：“如果你愿意，我们就像爱尔兰人一样结婚吧！”但言语间还是流露出抑制不住的幸福感。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I also sincerely hope that every pair of lovers in the world can get married like Irish people and love and protect each other whole-heartedly by committing themselves to a 100-year marriage.</div>

<div class="line_en">I still remember at that time that I said to my husband, "Ok, so sir, please choose the time you expect our marriage to last!" He said happily, "I even do not bother to think about it and would definitely choose 100 years because it is highly money-saving!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我依然记得自己当时对丈夫说的话：“既然这样，那么好吧，请这位先生选择一下你期望的婚姻期限吧！”他高兴地说：“还用多想吗，当然是100年了，因为最省钱嘛！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Later, I married him, a man who would like to stay with me for 100 years. Although we are not bound by the law of marriage in Ireland, we have cherished our vow to discipline ourselves all the time. We have married like Irish people and look on our marriage as a life-long commitment and spare no effort to nourish it hand in hand as we are gradually aging together.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="后来，我嫁给了这个愿意和我生活100年的男人。尽管，我们并不受爱尔兰婚姻法的约束，但却非常珍惜对彼此许下的誓言，一直都在自我约束。我们真的像爱尔兰人那样结婚了，把我们的婚姻看作一生的承诺并用心经营，希望能执子之手、与子偕老。">查看中文翻译</div>
