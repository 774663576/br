<div class="line_en">Ove just wants to die in peace. Is that really too much to ask? Ove doesn't think so. Fair enough, he should have arranged it six months ago, straight after her funeral. But you couldn't bloody carry on like that, he decided at the time. He had his job to take care of. How would it look if people stopped coming to work all over the place because they'd killed themselves?</div>

<div class="line_en">Ove's wife died on a Friday, was buried on Sunday, and then Ove went to work on Monday. Because that's how one handles things.

And on Tuesday he stood there oiling his kitchen worktops.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维的太太是星期五死的，葬礼在星期天举行，而星期一欧维就去上班了，因为做人就应该这样。六个月过去了，周一老板突然闯进来说不想在周五提这事是不想打扰欧维的周末，周二他就站在那儿给厨房操作台上油。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So he's prepared everything. He's paid the undertakers and arranged his place in the churchyard next to her. He's called the lawyers and written a letter with clear instructions and put it in an envelope with all his important receipts and the deeds of the house and the service history of the Saab. He's put this envelope in the inside pocket of his jacket. He's paid all the bills. He has no loans and no debts, so no one will have to clear up anything after him. He's even washed up his coffee cup and canceled the newspaper subscription. He is ready.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="周一午饭的时候，他就把一切都料理妥当了。他为葬礼付了款并预订了她旁边的那块墓地。他给律师打过电话并写了一封信，信上清楚地写明注意事项，和所有重要的发票、购房合同、萨博保养记录一起放进一个信封。他把信封放进外套的内侧袋里，关掉所有电灯并付了账单。没有贷款、没有负债、没人需要为他打理后事。欧维洗干净咖啡杯并退掉报纸杂志。他准备好了。">查看中文翻译</div>

How does one manage to turn oneself into a twin-size person? It must take a certain determination, he reflects.</div>

Tugs at the door handle three times. Walks up the little footpath between the houses. Stops outside the bicycle shed. There's a woman's bicycle leaning up against the wall. Again. Right under the sign clearly explaining that cycles should not be left in this precise spot.</div>

"So he gets something home-cooked now and then," she used to say. Ove noticed that they never got the containers back, adding that maybe the young man hadn't noticed the difference between the box and the food inside it. At which point Ove's wife would tell him that was enough. And then it was enough.</div>

<div class="line_en">There's a guarded silence. The lad looks at Ove as if he finds Ove unnecessarily thick. In return, Ove looks at the creature before him as if it were nothing but a waste of oxygen. Behind the youth, Ove notices, there's another youth. Even slimmer than the first one and with black stuff all around his eyes. The second youth tugs carefully at the first's jacket and murmurs something about "not causing trouble." His comrade kicks rebelliously at the snow, as if it were the snow's fault.</div>

Where those communists who pushed through the garbage sorting reform live with their daughters. Ove nods cautiously.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“那她可以来车棚里取。”欧维说。他用手指煞有介事地敲敲车棚门口那块“禁止停放自行车”的牌子，转身朝自己的房子走去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He says it more with resignation than indignation. His sneakers are too big and his jeans too small, Ove notes. His tracksuit jacket is pulled over his chin to protect him against the cold. His emaciated peach-fuzzed face is covered in blackheads and his hair looks as if someone saved him from drowning in a barrel by pulling him up by his locks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他说这话时泄气多过生气。欧维注意到他的运动鞋太大而牛仔裤太小。运动衣拉到脸颊来抵挡寒气。消瘦而毛茸茸的脸上长满了粉刺，发型就像刚被人拉着头发从一桶胶水里救出来一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He walks past the sign clearly prohibiting motor vehicles from entering the residential area. The one which the Pregnant Foreign Woman apparently could not read, even though Ove knows very well that it's quite impossible not to see it. He should know, because he's the one who put it there. Dissatisfied, he walks down the little footpath between the houses, stamping his feet so that anyone who saw him would think he was trying to flatten the tarmac. As if it wasn't bad enough with all the nutters already living on the street, he thinks. As if the whole area was not already being converted into some bloody speed bump in evolutionary progress. The Audi poser and the Blond Weed almost opposite Ove's house, and at the far end of the row that communist family with their teenage daughters and their red hair and their shorts over their trousers, their faces like mirror-image raccoons. Well, most likely they're on holiday in Thailand at this precise moment, but anyway.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他经过那块显眼的“社区内禁止车辆通行”牌。那块牌子，外国孕妇显然没看懂，尽管欧维知道看走眼是不可能的事。欧维肯定得知道，因为这块牌子是他竖的。他没好气地走在排屋之间的小路上，脚步铿锵，让人误以为他当自己是台压路机。就像这个小区住满智障还不够糟糕，他想。就像整个小区还没变成人类进化过程中该死的绊脚石。开奥迪的公子哥和金发霉女住在欧维家斜对面，整条街的最远处住着共产党一家，女儿们正值青春期，头发鲜红，内裤外穿，脸涂得就像翻版浣熊。是呀，他们现在一定是到泰国度假去了。简直了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In the house on the other side of Jimmy live Rune and his wife. Ove wouldn't exactly call Rune his "enemy"… or rather, he would. Everything that went to pot in the Residents' Association began with Rune. He and his wife, Anita, moved into the area on the same day that Ove and Sonja moved in. At that time Rune drove a Volvo, but later he bought a BMW. You just couldn't reason with a person who behaved like that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="另一端住着鲁尼和鲁尼太太。话说欧维也不该称鲁尼为他的死对头，但其实这个称呼实在贴切。这片住宅区的沦陷其实就始于鲁尼。他和太太安妮塔搬来的那天也正是欧维和太太入住的日子。当时鲁尼开着沃尔沃，但之后他又买了辆宝马，这件事本身就说明这样的男人不可理喻，欧维心想。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was Rune who pushed through the coup d'état that saw Ove deposed as chairman of the association. And just look at the state of the place now. Higher electricity bills and bicycles that aren't put away in the bike shed and people backing up with trailers in the residential area in spite of signs clearly stating that it's prohibited. Ove has long warned about these awful things, but no one has listened. Since then he has never showed his face in any meeting of the Residents' Association.</div>
