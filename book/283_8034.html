<div class="line_en">Harriet slept at Hartfield that night. For some weeks past she had been spending more than half her time there, and gradually getting to have a bed-room appropriated to herself; and Emma judged it best in every respect, safest and kindest, to keep her with them as much as possible just at present. She was obliged to go the next morning for an hour or two to Mrs. Goddard's, but it was then to be settled that she should return to Hartfield, to make a regular visit of some days.</div>

Mr. Knightley, who had nothing of ceremony about him, was offering by his short, decided answers, an amusing contrast to the protracted apologies and civil hesitations of the other.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我有理由认为，”奈特利先生说，“马上就会有人向哈丽特·史密斯求婚了，而且求婚的是一个无可挑剔的人——这人就是罗伯特·马丁。看样子，哈丽特今年夏天去阿比一米尔时，把他迷住了。他深深地爱上了她，想娶她为妻。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">`Well, well, means to make her an offer then. Will that do? He came to the Abbey two evenings ago, on purpose to consult me about it. He knows I have a thorough regard for him and all his family, and, I believe, considers me as one of his best friends. He came to ask me whether I thought it would be imprudent in him to settle so early; whether I thought her too young: in short, whether I approved his choice altogether; having some apprehension perhaps of her being considered (especially since your making so much of her) as in a line of society above him. I was very much pleased with all that he said. I never hear better sense from any one than Robert Martin. He always speaks to the purpose; open, straightforward, and very well judging. He told me every thing; his circumstances and plans, and what they all proposed doing in the event of his marriage. He is an excellent young man, both as son and brother. I had no hesitation in advising him to marry. He proved to me that he could afford it; and that being the case, I was convinced he could not do better. I praised the fair lady too, and altogether sent him away very happy. If he had never esteemed my opinion before, he would have thought highly of me then; and, I dare say, left the house thinking me the best friend and counsellor man ever had. This happened the night before last. Now, as we may fairly suppose, he would not allow much time to pass before he spoke to the lady, and as he does not appear to have spoken yesterday, it is not unlikely that he should be at Mrs. Goddard's to-day; and she may be detained by a visitor, without thinking him at all a tiresome wretch.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，他只是想向她求婚哪。这总可以吧？他前天晚上来到阿比一米尔，找我商量这件事。他知道我待他和他一家都很好，我想他把我当成了知心朋友。他来问我：他这么早就成家是否有些轻率；我是否觉得哈丽特还太年轻；简而言之，我是否同意他的选择。也许他有些担心，特别考虑到你把哈丽特培育得那么出色，他怕自己攀不上她。我非常爱听他这话，我觉得谁也没有罗伯特·马丁这么明白事理。他说起话来总是恰如其分，为人坦率，不遮不盖，还很通情达理。他把什么都告诉了我：他的家境，有什么打算，如能结婚，家里人计划怎么办。他是个好小伙子，无论当儿子还是做哥哥，都很出色。我毫不犹豫地劝他结婚。他向我表明，他结得起婚。既然如此，我觉得他最好结婚。我还赞扬了那位漂亮的小姐，让他高高兴兴地走了。如果说他以前从不把我的话当一回事的话，这一次他却很尊重我的意见了，而且我敢说，他临走时把我看成了最好的朋友，最善于出主意的人。这是前天晚上的事。可以料想，他很快就会向小姐表露钟情的。看来他昨天没有开口，今天可能去了戈达德家。哈丽特八成是让客人耽搁了，她可一点也不讨厌那个人。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">`Not Harriet's equal!' exclaimed Mr. Knightley loudly and warmly; and with calmer asperity, added, a few moments afterwards, `No, he is not her equal indeed, for he is as much her superior in sense as in situation. Emma, your infatuation about that girl blinds you. What are Harriet Smith's claims, either of birth, nature or education, to any connexion higher than Robert Martin? She is the natural daughter of nobody knows whom, with probably no settled provision at all, and certainly no respectable relations. She is known only as parlour-boarder at a common school. She is not a sensible girl, nor a girl of any information. She has been taught nothing useful, and is too young and too simple to have acquired any thing herself. At her age she can have no experience, and with her little wit, is not very likely ever to have any that can avail her. She is pretty, and she is good tempered, and that is all. My only scruple in advising the match was on his account, as being beneath his deserts, and a bad connexion for him. I felt that, as to fortune, in all probability he might do much better; and that as to a rational companion or useful helpmate, he could not do worse. But I could not reason so to a man in love, and was willing to trust to there being no harm in her, to her having that sort of disposition, which, in good hands, like his, might be easily led aright and turn out very well. The advantage of the match I felt to be all on her side; and had not the smallest doubt (nor have I now) that there would be a general cry-out upon her extreme good luck. Even your satisfaction I made sure of. It crossed my mind immediately that you would not regret your friend's leaving Highbury, for the sake of her being settled so well. I remember saying to myself, ``Even Emma, with all her partiality for Harriet, will think this a good match.'''</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“跟哈丽特不相配！”奈特利先生愤懑地大声嚷道。过了一会，他冷静了一些，以严厉的口吻说道：“是呀，他跟哈丽特还真不相配呢，无论在身份上还是在才智上，他都胜过哈丽特。爱玛，你对那姑娘太宠爱了，都失去了理智。哈丽特·史密斯在出身、性情和教养上有什么了不起的，居然要攀一个比罗伯特·马丁还强的人？她不知道是什么人的私生女，可能连生计也没有着落，当然更没有体面的亲戚。大家只知道她是一所普通小学的寄宿生，人不聪明，又缺乏见识。别人也没教她点有用的东西，而她自己又年轻又无知，自然也没学到什么本事。她处于这个年龄，不可能有什么经验，加上头脑愚笨，以后也不大可能获得什么有益的经验。她长得漂亮，脾气好，如此而已。我撮合这门亲事只有一个顾虑，就是怕委屈了马丁，给他找一个不般配的人。我觉得，就财产而言，他十有八九可以娶一个比哈丽特有钱得多的姑娘；就找一个明白事理的伴侣和有用的帮手而言，他也不可能娶一个还不如哈丽特的姑娘。但是，跟坠人情网的人是讲不通道理的，因此我就一心指望哈丽特也没有什么坏处，她有那样的好性子，跟着马丁那样的好青年，很容易上进，往好里发展。我觉得这门亲事只是对哈丽特有利。毫无疑问（我现在也毫不怀疑），大家都会说哈丽特真是万幸。我相信就是你也会感到很满意的。我当即想到，你的朋友嫁给这样一个好人家，你不会因为她要离开海伯里而感到惋惜。我记得我自言自语说：‘爱玛尽管十分偏爱哈丽特，她也会觉得这是一门好亲事。”’">查看中文翻译</div>

After receiving a very indifferent education she is left in Mrs. Goddard's hands to shift as she can; -- to move, in short, in Mrs. Goddard's line, to have Mrs. Goddard's acquaintance. Her friends evidently thought this good enough for her; and it was good enough. She desired nothing better herself. Till you chose to turn her into a friend, her mind had no distaste for her own set, nor any ambition beyond it. She was as happy as possible with the Martins in the summer. She had no sense of superiority then. If she has it now, you have given it. You have been no friend to Harriet Smith, Emma. Robert Martin would never have proceeded so far, if he had not felt persuaded of her not being disinclined to him. I know him well. He has too much real feeling to address any woman on the haphazard of selfish passion. And as to conceit, he is the farthest from it of any man I know. Depend upon it he had encouragement.'</div>

<div class="line_en">`You are a very warm friend to Mr. Martin; but, as I said before, are unjust to Harriet. Harriet's claims to marry well are not so contemptible as you represent them. She is not a clever girl, but she has better sense than you are aware of, and does not deserve to have her understanding spoken of so slightingly. Waiving that point, however, and supposing her to be, as you describe her, only pretty and good-natured, let me tell you, that in the degree she possesses them, they are not trivial recommendations to the world in general, for she is, in fact, a beautiful girl, and must be thought so by ninety-nine people out of an hundred; and till it appears that men are much more philosophic on the subject of beauty than they are generally supposed; till they do fall in love with well-informed minds instead of handsome faces, a girl, with such loveliness as Harriet, has a certainty of being admired and sought after, of having the power of chusing from among many, consequently a claim to be nice. Her good-nature, too, is not so very slight a claim, comprehending, as it does, real, thorough sweetness of temper and manner, a very humble opinion of herself, and a great readiness to be pleased with other people. I am very much mistaken if your sex in general would not think such beauty, and such temper, the highest claims a woman could possess.'</div>

<div class="line_en">`I have always thought it a very foolish intimacy,' said Mr. Knightley presently, `though I have kept my thoughts to myself; but I now perceive that it will be a very unfortunate one for Harriet. You will puff her up with such ideas of her own beauty, and of what she has a claim to, that, in a little while, nobody within her reach will be good enough for her. Vanity working on a weak head, produces every sort of mischief. Nothing so easy as for a young lady to raise her expectations too high. Miss Harriet Smith may not find offers of marriage flow in so fast, though she is a very pretty girl. Men of sense, whatever you may chuse to say, do not want silly wives. Men of family would not be very fond of connecting themselves with a girl of such obscurity -- and most prudent men would be afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they might be involved in, when the mystery of her parentage came to be revealed. Let her marry Robert Martin, and she is safe, respectable, and happy for ever; but if you encourage her to expect to marry greatly, and teach her to be satisfied with nothing less than a man of consequence and large fortune, she may be a parlour-boarder at Mrs. Goddard's all the rest of her life -- or, at least, (for Harriet Smith is a girl who will marry somebody or other,) till she grow desperate, and is glad to catch at the old writing-master's son.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我总觉得你们搞得这么亲热是很荒谬的，”奈特利先生马上说道，“不过我一直把这想法埋在心里。现在我认识到，这对哈丽特来说将是很不利的。你总夸她如何漂亮，条件如何好，搞得她忘乎所以了，用不了多久，周围的人她会一个也看不上眼的。头脑简单的人有了虚荣心，那是什么荒唐事都干得出来的。年轻小姐最容易冒出不切实际的幻想。哈丽特·史密斯小姐尽管很漂亮，求婚的人不见得会纷至沓来。不管你怎么说，聪明的男人不会要傻女人做老婆。出身高贵的男人是不大喜欢跟没有名分的姑娘结婚的——十分谨慎的男人担心她父母的秘密一揭露出来，他们自己要受连累，搞得很不光彩。她要是嫁给罗伯特·马丁，一辈子都会又平安，又体面，又快活。你要是鼓动她一心就想高攀，唆使她非要嫁给一个有钱有势的人，那她可能要在戈达德太太的学校里寄宿一辈子——或者至少要寄宿到她实在奈不住了，甘愿嫁给一个老书法教师的儿子，因为她终究是要嫁人的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">`To be sure!' cried she playfully. `I know that is the feeling of you all. I know that such a girl as Harriet is exactly what every man delights in -- what at once bewitches his senses and satisfies his judgment. Oh! Harriet may pick and chuse. Were you, yourself, ever to marry, she is the very woman for you.

No -- pray let her have time to look about her.'</div>

But as to my letting her marry Robert Martin, it is impossible; she has refused him, and so decidedly, I think, as must prevent any second application. She must abide by the evil of having refused him, whatever it may be; and as to the refusal itself, I will not pretend to say that I might not influence her a little; but I assure you there was very little for me or for any body to do. His appearance is so much against him, and his manner so bad, that if she ever were disposed to favour him, she is not now. I can imagine, that before she had seen any body superior, she might tolerate him. He was the brother of her friends, and he took pains to please her; and altogether, having seen nobody better (that must have been his great assistant) she might not, while she was at Abbey-Mill, find him disagreeable.

<div class="line_en">Emma made no answer, and tried to look cheerfully unconcerned, but was really feeling uncomfortable and wanting him very much to be gone. She did not repent what she had done; she still thought herself a better judge of such a point of female right and refinement than he could be; but yet she had a sort of habitual respect for his judgment in general, which made her dislike having it so loudly against her; and to have him sitting just opposite to her in angry state, was very disagreeable. Some minutes passed in this unpleasant silence, with only one attempt on Emma's side to talk of the weather, but he made no answer. He was thinking. The result of his thoughts appeared at last in these words. `Robert Martin has no great loss -- if he can but think so; and I hope it will not be long before he does. Your views for Harriet are best known to yourself; but as you make no secret of your love of match-making, it is fair to suppose that views, and plans, and projects you have; -- and as a friend I shall just hint to you that if Elton is the man, I think it will be all labour in vain.'</div>

Elton may talk sentimentally, but he will act rationally. He is as well acquainted with his own claims, as you can be with Harriet's. He knows that he is a very handsome young man, and a great favourite wherever he goes; and from his general way of talking in unreserved moments, when there are only men present, I am convinced that he does not mean to throw himself away.

<div class="line_en">Emma remained in a state of vexation too; but there was more indistinctness in the causes of her's, than in his. She did not always feel so absolutely satisfied with herself, so entirely convinced that her opinions were right and her adversary's wrong, as Mr. Knightley. He walked off in more complete self-approbation than he left for her. She was not so materially cast down, however, but that a little time and the return of Harriet were very adequate restoratives. Harriet's staying away so long was beginning to make her uneasy. The possibility of the young man's coming to Mrs. Goddard's that morning, and meeting with Harriet and pleading his own cause, gave alarming ideas. The dread of such a failure after all became the prominent uneasiness; and when Harriet appeared, and in very good spirits, and without having any such reason to give for her long absence, she felt a satisfaction which settled her with her own mind, and convinced her, that let Mr. Knightley think or say what he would, she had done nothing which woman's friendship and woman's feelings would not justify.</div>

He certainly might have heard Mr. Elton speak with more unreserve than she had ever done, and Mr. Elton might not be of an imprudent, inconsiderate disposition as to money matters; he might naturally be rather attentive than otherwise to them; but then, Mr. Knightley did not make due allowance for the influence of a strong passion at war with all interested motives. Mr. Knightley saw no such passion, and of course thought nothing of its effects; but she saw too much of it to feel a doubt of its overcoming any hesitations that a reasonable prudence might originally suggest; and more than a reasonable, becoming degree of prudence, she was very sure did not belong to Mr. Elton.</div>
