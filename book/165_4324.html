From her perch, she could take in the entire twenty-kilometer circumference of the collider.

<div class="line_en">Once, Yang Dong had held a basic belief: Life and the world were perhaps ugly, but at the limits of the micro and macro scales, everything was harmonious and beautiful. The world of our everyday life was only froth floating on the perfect ocean of deep reality.
