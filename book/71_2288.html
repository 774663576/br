<div class="line_en">She set off towards the Faubourg Saint-Germain, went down the Rue Mazarine and called for the driver to halt at the Passage du Pont-Neuf. Here she got down and crossed the street. She was very simply dressed, appropriately for a woman of taste at this time of day. At the Rue Guénégaud, she got into a cab and asked to be driven to the Rue du Harlay.</div>

<div class="line_en">The cab drove across the Pont Neuf and through the Place Dauphine into the courtyard at Rue du Harlay. Mme Danglars paid the driver as he opened the door and swept towards the stairway, which she lightly mounted, soon reaching the Salle des Pas-Perdus.</div>

<div class="line_en">No sooner was she inside the cab than she took a thick black veil out of her pocket and pinned it on her straw hat. Then she put the hat back on her head and was pleased to see, looking in her little pocket-mirror, that only her white skin and the shining pupils of her eyes were visible.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一坐进车厢里，她就从口袋里摸出一块极厚的黑色面纱，拿来绑在她的草帽上。然后她戴上帽子，在一面小镜子里一照，发觉所能看到的只有她那雪白的皮肤和那一对明亮的眼睛，心里觉得很欢喜。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was a crowd in M. de Villefort's antechamber, but Mme Danglars did not even have to mention his name. As soon as she appeared, an usher got up, came across to her and asked whether she were not the person who had an appointment with the crown prosecutor. When she replied that she was, he led her along a private corridor into M. de Villefort's study.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="维尔福先生的候见室里挤着一大堆人，但邓格拉司夫人甚至连姓名都不必通报。她一出现，传达便立刻起身向她迎上来，问她是不是检察官约见的那个人，她作了一个肯定的答复，于是他就领她从一条秘密甬道走到维尔福先生的公事房去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the morning there is lots of business and still more busy people in the Palais de Justice. Busy people do not bother much with women, so Mme Danglars crossed the Salle des Pas-Perdus without attracting any more notice than ten other women waiting to see their lawyers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天早晨要审问一件大案子，法院里有许多忙人。忙人极少注意女人，所以邓格拉司夫人越过大厅的时候，并没有比一个去拜访律师的女人惹起更多的注意。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The magistrate was sitting in his armchair, writing, with his back towards the door. He heard it open and the usher say: "This way, Madame!", then the door close, all without moving; but as soon as he heard the usher's footsteps going away along the corridor, he leapt up, went to draw the curtains, lock the doors and inspect every corner of the study. Only when his mind was at rest and he was certain of not being seen or heard, did he say: "Madame, thank you for your punctuality," and he offered Mme Danglars a seat, which she accepted, because her heart was beating so hard that she felt as though she was suffocating.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那位法官坐在一张圈椅里，背向着门，正在那儿写什么东西。他听到门打开，听到那传达说“请进，夫人”，然后又听到门关拢，他都没有动；但一到那个人的脚步声消失的时候，他立刻跳起身来，闩上门，拉拢窗帘，检查房间的每一个角落。然后，当他确定决不会有人能看到或听到，放下心来的时候，他说：“谢谢，夫人——谢谢您准时到来。”他递了一张椅子给邓格拉司夫人，她接受了，因为她的心是跳得这样猛烈，她觉得几乎快要窒息了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Villefort shook his head and sighed: "I tell myself that my place is not on the judge's bench, but in the dock with the accused."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="维尔福低头叹了一口气。“而我，”他说，“我觉得我不是坐在法官的审判席上，而是在犯人的凳子上。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You?" Mme Danglars said in astonishment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“您？”邓格拉司夫人惊愕地说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes, I."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，我。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I think that, so far as you are concerned, Monsieur," said Mme Danglars, her lovely eyes briefly lighting up, "you are overscrupulous and exaggerating the situation. The tracks that you mentioned have been made by all hot-blooded youths. Beneath passion and beyond pleasure, there is always a trace of remorse; and that is why the Gospel, that everlasting succour to the unfortunate, has given us poor women as a prop the excellent parable of the sinner and the woman taken in adultery. So, when I consider the follies of my youth, I sometimes think that God will forgive them, because some compensation for them (though not an excuse) is to be found in my sufferings. But what do you have to fear from all this, you men whom everyone excuses and who are elevated by scandal?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我想，阁下，你未免律己太严，把情形夸大了，”邓格拉司夫人那一对美丽的眼睛暂时焕发了一下。“您刚才所说的那种道路，凡是热情的青年，都是曾经经过的。当我们沉溺在热情里的时候，除了快乐以外，总会感觉到些微懊丧，为了那个理由，福音书上曾举出许多可歌可泣的例子，以改邪归正来安慰我们——我们这些可怜的女人。所以，我可以说，每当回忆到我们年轻时代的那些胡涂行为，有的时候，我想上帝已经宽恕了那些事情，因为我们所受的种种痛苦即使不能使我们免罪，但或许可以赎罪。但您——你们男人，社会人士从来不会责怪你们，愈多受诽谤愈能抬高你们的身份——您为什么要为那种事情耽忧呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Madame," Villefort replied, "you know me. I am not a hypocrite -- or, at least, I never dissemble without some purpose. My brow may be forbidding, but that is because it is darkened by many misfortunes; my heart may be stone, but it needs must be to withstand the blows that have assailed it. I was not like this in my youth, I was not like this at the betrothal feast in Marseille when we all sat at a table in the Rue du Cours. Since then, much has changed, both around me and within me. My life has been worn away in the pursuit of difficult things and in breaking down those who, voluntarily or otherwise, of their own free will or as a result of chance, stood in my way and raised such obstacles. It is rare to feel an ardent desire for something and not find that it is ardently defended by those from whom one would like to take it or seize it. So, most ill deeds present themselves to their perpetrators in the specious guise of necessity; then, when the deed has been committed -- in a moment of passion, fear or delirium -- one realizes that it might have been avoided. Blind as you were, you did not see the correct course of action, which now appears plainly and simply before you. You think: how can I have done that, instead of this? You ladies, on the other hand, are rarely tormented by remorse, because the decision rarely comes from you. Your misfortunes are almost always imposed on you and your errors almost always another's crime."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“夫人，”维尔福答道，“您知道我不是伪君子，或至少我从不毫无理由地自己欺骗自己。假如说我的额头上杀气太重，那是因为那上面凝聚着许多不幸，假如说我的心已经硬化，那是因为只有这样才能经得住所受的打击。我在年轻的时候并不是这样的。在我订婚的那天晚上，当我们大家围坐在马赛高碌路侯爵府的桌子旁边的时候，我并不是这样的。但从那时以后，我周围和内心的一切都改变了，我已惯于抵抗困难，已惯于在斗争中压毁那些有意或无意、自动或被动来挡在我路上的人。照一般的情形来说，凡是我们所最切望想得到的东西，也就是旁人最切望想阻止我们获得或阻止我们抢夺的东西。因此，人类的过错，在未犯之先，总觉得自己有很正当的理由，是必需的，于是，在一时的兴奋、迷乱或恐惧之下，过错铸成了，而在犯了过错以后，我们才看到它本来是可以避免或逃避的。我们本来可以用某种很正当的方法，但那种方法我们事先一点都看不到，而事后却似乎觉得很简单容易，于是我们就说：‘我为什么要这样做而不那样做呢？’女人却正巧相反，女人很少受后悔的痛苦——因为事情并不是你们决定的，你们的不幸通常总是旁人加到你们身上来的，而你们的过失几乎总就是旁人的罪。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"We thought he was dead," he repeated. "I put him in a box that would serve as a coffin and went down to the garden, where I dug a grave and hastily buried it. I had just finished covering it with earth when the Corsican struck me. I saw a shape rise up and the flash of a blade. I felt a stab of pain and tried to cry out, but an icy shudder ran through my body and stifled the cry in my throat. I fell, dying; I thought I was dead. I shall never forget your sublime courage when, regaining my senses, I dragged myself with one final effort to the foot of the staircase where you, though you were yourself on the brink of death, came over to me. We had to hush up this awful catastrophe. You bravely returned home, supported by your nurse, while I used a duel as an excuse for my wound. Astonishingly, we both managed to keep the secret. I was carried to Versailles and, for three months, fought against death. Finally, when I seemed to be over the worst, I was prescribed the sun and air of the south. Four men carried me from Paris to Chalon, at a rate of six leagues a day. Madame de Villefort followed the stretcher in her carriage. In Chalon, I was put on the Saône, then on the Rhône and, carried by the current, I went down to Arles, where I once more took to my stretcher and continued to Marseille. My convalescence lasted six months. I heard nothing of you and did not dare ask after you. When I returned to Paris, I learned that Monsieur de Nargonne had died and you had married Monsieur Danglars.</div>

Always the same thing: the child's body which, every night in my dreams, rose up out of the earth and hovered over the grave, threatening me with its look and gesture. So, no sooner had I returned to Paris than I asked about the house. It had not been inhabited since we left, but it had just been leased for nine years. I went to find the tenant and pretended that I was most anxious that this house, which belonged to my wife's parents, should not fall into the hands of strangers. I offered them compensation in exchange for the lease. They asked for six thousand francs; I would have given ten thousand or twenty thousand. I had the money on me and, there and then, got them to sign the papers. As soon as the lease was in my hands, I set off at a gallop for Auteuil. Since I had last been there, no one had entered the house.</div>

<div class="line_en">"The Corsican who had declared a vendetta against me, who had followed me from Nîmes to Paris, who had hidden in the garden and struck me: this man had seen me dig the grave and bury the child. He might discover who you were, perhaps he knew it already. Would he not one day make you pay for his silence in this terrible business? Would that not be a sweet revenge for him, when he learned that I had not died from my wound? So it was urgent for me, first and foremost, to get rid of all traces of the past and destroy any material evidence. The reality was clearly enough present in my mind.</div>

My heart beat so fast in the silence that I thought my wound would re-open. Then, finally, I heard all the noises of the country cease, one by one. I realized that I had nothing more to fear, that I could neither be seen nor heard, and I decided to go downstairs.</div>

I took my bearings, looked at the trees, tried to recognize the details that had struck me. A sharp, cold breeze was whining through the naked branches, yet my brow was covered in sweat. I remembered that the dagger had struck me just as I was stamping on the ground to cover the grave. As I did so, I leant against a laburnum-tree, and behind me was an artificial rock intended to serve as a bench, because, when I fell, my hand had gone from the laburnum to the cold of the stone.

<div class="line_en">"Of course. He is odd, that's all. I did, however, notice one thing which is that, throughout the whole of that exquisite meal which he gave us, he himself touched nothing from any dish."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“当然罗。他很古怪，但只是如此而已。我注意到一点——他放在我们面前那许多珍馐美味，他自己一点都没有尝，他总是吃另外一个碟子里的东西。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes, I too noticed that. If I had known what I know now, I should not have eaten anything myself. I should have thought he wanted to poison us."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，是的！”维尔福说，“我也注意到那一点，假如我那时知道了现在所知道的一切，我就什么都不吃了，我会以为他想毒死我们。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You will understand," Villefort said affectionately, "if I repeat: no one -- forgive me for insisting -- no one in the world?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"Certainly, but that man, believe me, has some other plans. This is why I wanted to see you, why I asked to speak to you and why I wanted to warn you against everyone, but especially against him. Tell me," he said, staring harder at the baroness than ever, "have you mentioned our affair to anyone?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，那是毫无疑问的，但相信我吧，那个人还有别的计划。为了那个理由，我要见您一次，跟您谈一谈，并警告您防范每一个人，尤其要防范他。告诉我，”维尔福把他的眼睛极其坚定地盯住她，喊道，“您是否曾向任何人泄漏过我们的关系？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes, I do fully understand," the baroness said, blushing. "Never, I swear."</div>

<div class="line_en">"I sleep like a baby. Don't you remember?" The blood rushed to her face and out of Villefort's. "That's true," he said in a barely audible voice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我睡觉的时候象一个小孩子一样，您不记得了吗？”男爵夫人的脸上泛出红色，而维尔福却脸色转白。“这是真的。”他说，这句话的声音是这样低，甚至他自己都难于听到。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, then?" asked the baroness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“怎么样？”男爵夫人说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, then, I know what has to be done. Within a week, I shall know what this Monte Cristo is, where he comes from, where he is going and why he tells us about children dug up from his garden."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嗯，我懂得我现在应该怎么办了，”维尔福回答。“从现在起，在一个星期之内，我就可以知道这位基督山先生是谁，他从哪儿来，要往哪儿去，为什么他要对我们说他在花园里掘到孩子的尸体。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Villefort spoke these words in a tone of voice that would have made the count shudder if he could have heard them. Then he shook the hand which the baroness reluctantly gave him and respectfully showed her to the door. Mme Danglars hailed another cab, which took her back to the passage, at the far end of which she found her own carriage and her coachman who had been sleeping peacefully on his seat while waiting for her return.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="维尔福说这几句话时的语气，要是伯爵听到了，一定会要打一个寒颤。然后他吻了一下男爵夫人不太情愿地伸给他的那只手，恭恭敬敬地领她到门口。邓格拉司夫人另外雇了一辆出租马车到巷口，在那条小巷的另一端找到了自己的马车，她的车夫正安安稳稳地睡在座位上等她。">查看中文翻译</div>
