<meta content="纽约的一条大街上，一位值勤的警察正沿街走着。一阵冷飕飕的风向他迎面吹来。已近夜间10点，街上的行人寥寥无几了。他一边走一边试着拉开店铺的门，用许多复杂而巧妙的动作转动着警棍，不时地转过身来，把他警惕的目光投向太平洋大道上，那军官以他坚定的姿态和轻微的昂首阔步，给人以一幅和平卫士的样貌。" name="description"/>

<div class="line_en">The policeman on the beat moved up the avenue impressively. The impressiveness was habitual and not for show, for spectators were few. The time was barely 10 o'clock at night, but chilly gusts of wind with a taste of rain in them had well nigh dispeopled the streets.</div>

<div class="line_en">Trying doors as he went, twirling his club with many intricate and artful movements, turning now and then to cast his watchful eye adown the pacific thoroughfare, the officer, with his stalwart form and slight swagger, made a fine picture of a guardian of the peace.</div>

<div class="line_en">The vicinity was one that kept early hours. Now and then you might see the lights of a cigar store or of an all-night lunch counter; but the majority of the doors belonged to business places that had long since been closed.</div>

<div class="line_en">When about midway of a certain block the policeman suddenly slowed his walk. In the doorway of a darkened hardware store a man leaned, with an unlighted cigar in his mouth. As the policeman walked up to him the man spoke up quickly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大约过了一个街区，警察突然放慢了脚步。在一家黑压压的五金店门口，一个人斜靠着，嘴里叼着一支未点燃的雪茄。当警察走到他跟前时，那人很快就开口了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's all right, officer," he said, reassuringly. "I'm just waiting for a friend. It's an appointment made twenty years ago. Sounds a little funny to you, doesn't it? Well, I'll explain if you'd like to make certain it's all straight. About that long ago there used to be a restaurant where this store stands -- 'Big Joe' Brady's restaurant."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这儿没有出什么事，警官先生。”看见警察向自己走来，那个男子很快地说，“我只是在这儿等一位朋友罢了。这是20年前定下的一个约会。你听了觉得稀奇，是吗？好吧，如果有兴致听的话，我来给你讲讲。大约20年前，这儿，这个店铺现在所占的地方，原来是一家餐馆……”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“那餐馆5年前就被拆除了。”警察接上去说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The man in the doorway struck a match and lit his cigar. The light showed a pale, square-jawed face with keen eyes, and a little white scar near his right eyebrow. His scarfpin was a large diamond, oddly set.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="男子划了根火柴，点燃了叼在嘴上的雪茄。借着火柴的亮光，警察发现这个男子脸色苍白，右眼角附近有一块小小的白色的伤疤。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Twenty years ago tonight," said the man, "I dined here at 'Big Joe' Brady's with Jimmy Wells, my best chum, and the finest chap in the world. He and I were raised here in New York, just like two brothers, together. I was eighteen and Jimmy was twenty. The next morning I was to start for the West to make my fortune. You couldn't have dragged Jimmy out of New York; he thought it was the only place on earth. Well, we agreed that night that we would meet here again exactly twenty years from that date and time, no matter what our conditions might be or from what distance we might have to come. We figured that in twenty years each of us ought to have our destiny worked out and our fortunes made, whatever they were going to be."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“20年前的今天晚上，”男子继续说，“我和吉米·维尔斯在这儿的餐馆共进晚餐。哦，吉米是我最要好的朋友。我们俩都是在纽约这个城市里长大的。从孩提时候起，我们就亲密无间，情同手足。当时，我正准备第二天早上就动身到西部去谋生。那天夜晚临分手的时候，我们俩约定：20年后的同一日期、同一时间，我们俩将来到这里再次相会。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It sounds pretty interesting," said the policeman. "Rather a long time between meets, though, it seems to me. Haven't you heard from your friend since you left?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这听起来倒挺有意思的。”警察说，“你们分手以后，你就没有收到过你那位朋友的信吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, yes, for a time we corresponded," said the other. "But after a year or two we lost track of each other. You see, the West is a pretty big proposition, and I kept hustling around over it pretty lively. But I know Jimmy will meet me here if he's alive, for he always was the truest, stanchest old chap in the world. He'll never forget. I came a thousand miles to stand in this door to-night, and it's worth it if my old partner turns up."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，收到过他的信。有一段时间我们曾相互通信。”那男子 说，“可是一两年之后，我们就失去了联系。你知道，西部是个很大的地方。而我呢，又总是不断地东奔西跑。可我相信，吉米只要还活着，就一定会来这儿和我相会的。他是我最信得过的朋友啦。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“当然罗！吉米的光景要是能赶上我的一半就好了。尽管如此，他还是一个不屈不挠的好人。我必须和一些最聪明的人竞争，一个人在纽约实在单调乏味！这些年来，我一直不得不东奔西跑。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“不会的。我起码要再等他半个小时。如果吉米他还活在人间，他到时候一定会来到这儿的。就说这些吧，再见，警官先生。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was now a fine, cold drizzle falling, and the wind had risen from its uncertain puffs into a steady blow. The few foot passengers astir in that quarter hurried dismally and silently along with coat collars turned high and pocketed hands. And in the door of the hardware store the man who had come a thousand miles to fill an appointment, uncertain almost to absurdity, with the friend of his youth, smoked his cigar and waited.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在下起了一场细雨，寒冷的毛毛雨，风慢慢稳定下来了。几个步行的路人沮丧地、沉默地匆匆走着，衣领也翻得高高的，双手塞在口袋里。在五金店的门上，一个千里之行来赴约的人，等着他年轻时的朋友，抽着雪茄，等待着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">About twenty minutes he waited, and then a tall man in a long overcoat, with collar turned up to his ears, hurried across from the opposite side of the street. He went directly to the waiting man.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Bless my heart!" exclaimed the new arrival, grasping both the other's hands with his own. "It's Bob, sure as fate. I was certain I'd find you here if you were still in existence. Well, well, well! -- twenty years is a long time. The old gone, Bob; I wish it had lasted, so we could have had another dinner there. How has the West treated you, old man?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="来人握住了男子的双手。“不错，你是鲍勃。我早就确信我会在这儿见到你的。啧，啧，啧！20年是个不短的时间啊！你看，鲍勃！原来的那个饭馆已经不在啦！要是它没有被拆除，我们再一块儿在这里面共进晚餐该多好啊！鲍勃，你在西部的情况怎么样？”">查看中文翻译</div>
