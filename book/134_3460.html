<div class="line_en">She took a room, had her bags carried up, then went out for a walk through the main street. There was a movie house, and it occurred to her she had never seen a movie with Carol. She went in. But she was in no mood to follow the picture, even though there was a woman in it whose voice was a little like Carol's, not at all like the flat nasal voices she heard all around her. She thought of Carol, over a thousand miles away now, thought of sleeping alone tonight, and she got up and wandered out on the street again. There was the drugstore where Carol had bought cleansing tissues and toothpaste one morning. And the corner where Carol had looked up and read the street names -- Fifth and Nebraska streets. She bought a pack of cigarettes at the same drugstore, walked back to the hotel and sat in the lobby, smoking, savoring the first cigarette since she had left Carol, savoring the forgotten state of being alone. It was only a physical state. She really did not feel at all alone. She read some newspapers for a while, then took the letters from Dannie and Phil, that had come in the last days at Colorado Springs, out of her handbag and glanced over them.</div>

His wife Edna was fat and did the cooking, and talked a great deal less than he. Dutch had worked in New York for a while years ago. He asked her questions about sections of the city she happened not to know at all, while she mentioned places Dutch had never heard of or had forgotten, and somehow the slow, dragging conversation made them both laugh. Dutch asked her if she would like to go with him and his wife to the motorcycle races that were to be held a few miles out of town on Saturday, and Therese said yes.</div>

<div class="line_en">Monday morning, she sat in the library reading plays. Then around two, when the noonday rush was slacking off in Dutch's diner, she went in and had some tea, and talked with Dutch while she played the songs on the juke box that she and Carol had used to play. She had told Dutch that the car belonged to the friend for whom she was waiting. And gradually, Dutch's intermittent questions led her to tell him that Carol lived in New Jersey, that she would probably fly out, that Carol wanted to go to New Mexico.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="礼拜一早晨，她坐在图书馆看剧本。下午两点左右，等到达屈的餐馆里中午用餐的人潮逐渐散去，她才走进去喝了些茶。她在点唱机放歌的同时和达屈聊了起来，播放的歌曲正是她以前和卡罗尔一起时曾放过的歌。她告诉过达屈，那辆车是她正在等候的那个朋友的。达屈偶尔问了几个问题，她就告诉他卡罗尔住在新泽西，可能会搭飞机过来，还告诉达屈说，卡罗尔想去新墨西哥州。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Tuesday the letter came from Carol, nothing but a short note, but it said Fred was more optimistic about everything, and it looked as if there would be nothing but the divorce to worry about and she could probably leave the twenty-fourth of February. Therese began to smile as she read it. She wanted to go out and celebrate with someone, but there was no one, so there was nothing to do but take a walk, have a lonely drink at the bar of the Warrior, and think of Carol five days away. There was no one she would have wanted to be with, except perhaps Dannie. Or Stella Overton. Stella was jolly, and though she couldn't have told Stella anything about Carol -- whom could she tell?-- it would have been good to see her now. She had meant to write Stella a card days ago, but she hadn't yet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡罗尔的信终于在礼拜二抵达，只是一则简短的讯息，说弗雷德对情势的态度比较乐观，看起来除了离婚外，没什么好担心的，她可能在二月二十四日就能离开。特芮丝读信的时候开始微笑，她想出去找人庆祝，但又没有人可以一起庆祝，能做的只有散步，在战士饭店的酒吧独自喝酒，还有思念五天后才能见面的卡罗尔。也许除了丹尼以外，她不想跟任何一个人共处。史黛拉·欧维顿呢？史黛拉能带来欢乐的气氛，不过她也不能把她和卡罗尔之间的事情告诉史黛拉。这件事她能向谁说呢？假如现在能看到史黛拉，应该也很不错。她几天前就想写张卡片给史黛拉，但一直到现在还没动笔。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The news is wonderful. I celebrated with a single daiquiri at the Warrior. Not that I am conservative, but did you know that one drink has the kick of three when you are alone?… I love this town because it all reminds me of you. I know you don't like it any more than any other town, but that isn't the point. I mean you are here as much as I can bear you to be, not being here…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="你的消息太棒了，我在战士饭店独饮了一杯鸡尾酒庆祝。不是我作风保守，但你知道孤独一人时，一杯酒有三杯的效果吗？……我爱这个小城，因为这里让我想到你。我也知道你对这个小城没有特别的感觉，但这不是重点。我的意思是，我好希望你在这里，但你又不在这里……">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Carol wrote: I never liked Florence. I say this as a prelude. It seems Florence found the note you wrote to me and sold it to Harge -- at a price. She is also responsible for Harge's knowing where we (or at least I) were going, I've no doubt. I don't know what I left around the house or what she might have overheard, I thought I was pretty silent, but if Harge took the trouble to bribe her and I'm sure he did, there's no telling. They picked us up in Chicago, anyway. Darling, I had no idea how far this thing had gone. To give you the atmosphere -- nobody tells me anything, things are just suddenly discovered. If anyone is in possession of the facts, it is Harge. I spoke with him on the phone, and he refuses to tell me anything, which of course is calculated to terrorize me into giving all my ground before the fight has even begun. They don't know me, any of them, if they think I will. The fight of course is over Rindy, and yes, darling, I'm afraid there will be one, and I can't leave the 24th.</div>

<div class="line_en">That much Harge did tell me when he sprang the letter this morning on the phone. I think the letter may be his strongest weapon (the dictaphone business only went on in Colorado S. so far as I can possibly imagine) hence his letting me know about it. But I can imagine the kind of letter it is, written even before we took off, and there'll be a limit to what even Harge can read into it. Harge is merely threatening -- in the peculiar form of silence -- hoping I will back out completely as far as Rindy is concerned. I won't, so there will come some kind of a showdown, I hope not in court.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈吉今天早上在电话里跟我说了那封信的事情。我在想，那封信大概是他最有力的武器（就我所知，窃听录音机的事件只发生在科罗拉多泉市），所以他才会让我知道。但我也可以想像，你写完这封信的时候，我们两人还没出发旅行呢，所以哈吉能从里面了解的东西也十分有限。哈吉只是在用他特有的沉默方式威胁我，希望我在琳蒂的监护权这件事上完全退让。我才不会退让，最后的摊牌局面一定会出现，我只希望不要在法庭上发生。">查看中文翻译</div>
