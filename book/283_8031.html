We were speaking of it only yesterday, and agreeing how fortunate it was for Emma, that there should be such a girl in Highbury for her to associate with. Mr. Knightley, I shall not allow you to be a fair judge in this case. You are so much used to live alone, that you do not know the value of a companion; and, perhaps no man can be a good judge of the comfort a woman feels in the society of one of her own sex, after being used to it all her life. I can imagine your objection to Harriet Smith. She is not the superior young woman which Emma's friend ought to be. But on the other hand, as Emma wants to see her better informed, it will be an inducement to her to read more herself. They will read together. She means it, I know.'</div>

I have seen a great many lists of her drawing-up at various times of books that she meant to read regularly through -- and very good lists they were -- very well chosen, and very neatly arranged -- sometimes alphabetically, and sometimes by some other rule. The list she drew up when only fourteen -- I remember thinking it did her judgment so much credit, that I preserved it some time; and I dare say she may have made out a very good list now. But I have done with expecting any course of steady reading from Emma. She will never submit to any thing requiring industry and patience, and a subjection of the fancy to the understanding. Where Miss Taylor failed to stimulate, I may safely affirm that Harriet Smith will do nothing. -- You never could persuade her to read half so much as you wished. -- You know you could not.'</div>

Emma is spoiled by being the cleverest of her family. At ten years old, she had the misfortune of being able to answer questions which puzzled her sister at seventeen. She was always quick and assured: Isabella slow and diffident. And ever since she was twelve, Emma has been mistress of the house and of you all. In her mother she lost the only person able to cope with her. She inherits her mother's talents, and must have been under subjection to her.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我还真不想勾起这样的回忆，”奈特利先生颇有感触地说道，过了一会又平静了下来。“不过，”他接着说道，“我不是个耳聋眼花、头脑糊涂的人，还得看，还得听，还得回忆。爱玛因为是家里最聪明的人，就被宠坏了。她十岁的时候，就不幸地能回答十七岁的姐姐也回答不了的问题。她总是很敏锐，很有自信，而伊莎贝拉却又迟钝，又缺乏自信。爱玛自十二岁起，就成了家里的女主人，你们大家都得听她的。她母亲一去世，她就失去了唯一能管束她的人。她继承了母亲的天赋，当年一定是听她的话的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">`Yes,' said he, smiling. `You are better placed here; very fit for a wife, but not at all for a governess. But you were preparing yourself to be an excellent wife all the time you were at Hartfield. You might not give Emma such a complete education as your powers would seem to promise; but you were receiving a very good education from her, on the very material matrimonial point of submitting your own will, and doing as you were bid; and if Weston had asked me to recommend him a wife, I should certainly have named Miss Taylor.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，”奈特利先生笑嘻嘻地说。“你在这儿更合适。你很适合做太太，一点也不适合做家庭教师。不过，你在哈特菲尔德的时候，一直在为做一个贤惠的妻子做准备。从你的能力看，你本来似乎能给爱玛一个圆满的教育，可你也许没有做到这一点。不过，你倒接受了爱玛给你的良好教育，以后处理夫妻关系这个重大问题时，可以做到放弃自己的意愿，听从别人的吩咐。当初韦斯顿要是问我谁做他妻子最合适，我一定会推举你泰勒小姐。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">`Not I, indeed. I only name possibilities. I do not pretend to Emma's genius for foretelling and guessing. I hope, with all my heart, the young man may be a Weston in merit, and a Churchill in fortune. -- But Harriet Smith -- I have not half done about Harriet Smith. I think her the very worst sort of companion that Emma could possibly have. She knows nothing herself, and looks upon Emma as knowing every thing. She is a flatterer in all her ways; and so much the worse, because undesigned. Her ignorance is hourly flattery. How can Emma imagine she has any thing to learn herself, while Harriet is presenting such a delightful inferiority? And as for Harriet, I will venture to say that she cannot gain by the acquaintance. Hartfield will only put her out of conceit with all the other places she belongs to. She will grow just refined enough to be uncomfortable with those among whom birth and circumstances have placed her home. I am much mistaken if Emma's doctrines give any strength of mind, or tend at all to make a girl adapt herself rationally to the varieties of her situation in life. -- They only give a little polish.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我还真不是预言。我只是说说可能性。我可并不自以为具有爱玛那样的天赋，又能预言，又会猜测。我衷心希望，那个年轻人继承了韦斯顿家的品德，邱吉尔家的财富。可是哈丽特—史密斯——我对她的看法还远远没有说完。我认为，她是爱玛可能找到的最糟糕的伙伴。她自己什么也不懂，却以为爱玛什么都懂。她对她百般逢迎，而且并非故意这么做，因而更加糟糕。她由于无知，便时时刻刻地奉承别人。哈丽特甘愿摆出一副低首下心、讨人喜欢的样子，爱玛怎能觉得自己还有什么不足之处呢？至于哈丽特，我敢说她也不会从这场结交中得到好处。哈特菲尔德只会使她忘乎所以，不再喜欢一切与她身份相符的地方。她会变得十分骄气，跟那些与她出身和境况相当的人待在一起，会觉得非常别扭。我不相信爱玛的教诲能起到陶冶心性的作用，让一个姑娘理智地适应各种生活环境，而只能给她镀一点金罢了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
