<div class="line_en">Rolliver's inn, the single alehouse at this end of the long and broken village, could only boast of an off-license; licence, as nobody could legally drink on the premises, the amount of overt accommodation for consumers was strictly limited to a little board about six inches wide and two yards long, fixed to the garden palings by pieces of wire, so as to form a ledge. On this board thirsty strangers deposited their cups as they stood in the road and drank, and threw the dregs on the dusty ground to the pattern of Polynesia, and wished they could have a restful seat inside.</div>

<div class="line_en">In a large bedroom upstairs, the window of which was thickly curtained with a great woollen shawl lately discarded by the landlady Mrs Rolliver, were gathered on this evening nearly a dozen persons, all seeking beatitude; all old inhabitants of the nearer end of Marlott, and frequenters of this retreat. Not only did the distance to The Pure Drop, the fully-licensed tavern at the further part of the dispersed village, render its accommodation practically unavailable for dwellers at this end; but the far more serious question, the quality of the liquor, confirmed the prevalent opinion that it was better to drink with Rolliver in a corner of the housetop than with the other landlord in a wide house.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mrs Durbeyfield, having quickly walked hitherward after parting from Tess, opened the front door, crossed the downstairs room, which was in deep gloom, and then unfastened the stair-door like one whose fingers knew the tricks of the latches well. Her ascent of the crooked staircase was a slower process, and her face, as it rose into the light above the last stair, encountered the gaze of all the party assembled in the bedroom.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="德北菲尔德太太离开苔丝以后，就急急忙忙赶到这里，打开前门，穿过楼下阴沉沉的房间，然后就好像是一个十分熟悉楼梯门栓机关的人，用手指打开了楼门。她在弯弯曲曲的楼梯上慢慢地走上去，当她走上最后一节楼梯，脸从灯光里一露出来，所有挤在卧室里的人都一起把目光转到了她的身上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A gaunt four-post bedstead which stood in the room afforded sitting-space for several persons gathered round three of its sides; a couple more men had elevated themselves on a chest of drawers; another rested on the oak-carved 'cwoffer'; two on the washstand; another on the stool; and thus all were, somehow, seated at their ease. The stage of mental comfort to which they had arrived at his hour was one wherein their souls expanded beyond their skins, and spread their personalities warmly through the room. In this process the chamber and its furniture grew more and more dignified and luxurious; the shawl hanging at the window took upon itself the richness of tapestry; the brass handles of the chest of drawers were as golden knockers; and the carved bed-posts seemed to have some kinship with the magnificent pillars of Solomon's temple.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卧室里摆放着一张四柱床，床柱又细又长，这张床的三面给好几个聚集在那儿的人当了座位；还有两个人高踞在五十橱上；另一个坐在雕花橡木小柜上；还有两个坐在盥洗架上，一个坐在小凳上；那儿所有的人，就都这样给自己找到了舒服的座位。在这个时候，他们达到了心灵欢快的阶段，灵魂超脱了躯壳，热情洋溢，全屋子一片火热。在喝酒的过程中，房间和房间里的家具变得越来越富丽堂皇；窗户上悬挂的披肩添上了织花帷幔的华贵；五斗橱上的铜把手就像是黄金做成的门环；四柱床的雕花床柱，同所罗门庙宇的宏伟廊柱也有了几分相似。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They went home together, Tess holding one arm of her father, and Mrs Durbeyfield the other. He had, in truth, drunk very little -- not a fourth of the quantity which a systematic tippler could carry to church on a Sunday afternoon without a hitch in his eastings or genuflections; but the weakness of Sir John's constitution made mountains of his petty sins in this kind. On reaching the fresh air he was sufficiently unsteady to incline the row of three at one moment as if they were marching to London, and at another as if they were marching to Bath -- which produced a comical effect, frequent enough in families on nocturnal home goings; and, like most comical effects, not quite so comic after all. The two women valiantly disguised these forced excursions and countermarches as well as they could from Durbeyfield their cause, and from Abraham, and from themselves; and so they approached by degrees their own door, the head of the family bursting suddenly into his former refrain as he drew near, as if to fortify his soul at sight of the smallness of his present residence --</div>

<div class="line_en">The poor creature looked wonderingly round at the night, at the lantern, at their two figures, as if he could not believe that at that hour, when every living thing was intended to be in shelter and at rest, he was called upon to go out and labour. They put a stock of candle ends into the lantern, hung the latter to the off side of the load, and directed the horse onward, walking at his shoulder at first during the uphill parts of the way, in order not to overload an animal of so little vigour. To cheer themselves as well as they could, they made an artificial morning with the lantern, some bread and butter, and their own conversation, the real morning being far from come. Abraham, as he more fully awoke (for he had moved in a sort of trance so far), began to talk of the strange shapes assumed by the various dark objects against the sky; of this tree that looked like a raging tiger springing from a lair; of that which resembled a giant's head.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那头可怜的牲畜茫然四顾，望望夜空，望望提灯，望望姐弟俩的身影，仿佛它难以相信在那个时刻，当一切生物还在它们的栖身之处歇息的时候，会把它叫出来干活。他们把一些蜡烛头放进提灯，把提灯挂在车右边，就牵着马向前走，最初的一段路是向上走的坡路，他们就走在马的旁边，免得这匹缺少力气的老马负载过重。为了尽量使自己高兴起来，他们就用提灯制造出人造的黎明，吃着黄油面包，谈天说地，其实真正的黎明还远没有到来。亚伯拉罕已经完全清醒过来（因为他刚才一直是迷迷糊糊的），就开始讲在夜空的映衬下各种不同的黑色物体所表现出来的奇形怪状，说这棵树像一只从洞中扑出来的发怒猛虎，又说那棵树很像一个巨人的头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When they had passed the little town of Stourcastle, dumbly somnolent under its thick brown thatch, they reached higher ground. Still higher, on their left, the elevation called Bulbarrow or Bealbarrow, well-nigh the highest in South Wessex, swelled into the sky, engirdled by its earthen trenches. From hereabout the long road was fairly level for some distance onward. They mounted in front of the waggon, and Abraham grew reflective.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们走过斯图尔堡小镇的时候，小镇内覆盖着褐色厚茅草的茅屋还在静静地沉睡着，他们走到了一块更高的地方。在左边还要高一些的地方，是一处被叫做野牛坟或比尔坟的高地，它几乎就是南威塞克斯的最高点，迎天耸立，四周被土沟围绕着。从这儿再往前，这条漫长的道路就有一段比较平坦。他们上了车，坐在马车的前面，亚伯拉罕开始沉思起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">His sister became abruptly still, and lapsed into a pondering silence. Abraham talked on, rather for the pleasure of utterance than for audition, so that his sister's abstraction was of no account. He leant back against the hives, and with upturned face made observations on the stars, whose cold pulses were beating amid the black hollows above, in serene dissociation from these two wisps of human life. He asked how far away those twinklers were, and whether God was on the other side of them. But ever and anon his childish prattle recurred to what impressed his imagination even more deeply than the wonders of creation. If Tess were made rich by marrying a gentleman, would she have money enough to buy a spyglass so large that it would draw the stars as near to her as Nettlecombe-Tout?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的姐姐突然坐在那儿一动也不动了，陷入沉思默想之中。亚伯拉罕继续说着，只图自己说得痛快，而不管听的人怎样，因此没有注意到他的姐姐在那儿出神。他仰身向后靠在蜂箱上，仰着脸观察天上的星星，星星冷清的脉搏在头顶上漆黑的夜空里搏动着，静寂无声，同人类生命中这两个小生命相隔遥远。她问姐姐那些眨眼的星星离他们究竟有多远，问上帝是不是就在那些星星的背后。不过毕竟他只是一个孩子，所以他的唠叨就又回到了比创造的奇迹更为深入的想象的话题上了。假如苔丝嫁给了一个绅士而变得富有了，她会不会有足够多的钱买一架大望远镜，大得能够把星星拉到跟前来，就跟荨麻越一样近？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then, examining the mesh of events in her own life, she seemed to see the vanity of her father's pride; the gentlemanly suitor awaiting herself in her mother's fancy; to see him as a grimacing personage, laughing at her poverty, and her shrouded knightly ancestry. Everything grew more and more extravagant, and she no longer knew how time passed. A sudden jerk shook her in her seat, and Tess awoke from the sleep into which she, too, had fallen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着，她仔细地回想了自己一生中纷乱无序的事情，似乎看见她父亲骄傲中的虚荣；在她母亲的幻想里，她看到了那个向她求婚的绅士模样的人；看见他像是一个怪笑着的怪人，在嘲笑她的贫穷，嘲笑她的已成枯骨的骑士祖先。一切都变得越来越荒诞离奇，她再也不知道时间是怎样过去的了。马车猛地把她的座位一震，苔丝才从睡梦中醒来，原来她也睡着了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Left to his reflections Abraham soon grew drowsy. Tess was not skilful in the management of a horse, but she thought that she could take upon herself the entire conduct of the load for the present, and allow Abraham to go to sleep if he wished to do so. She made him a sort of nest in front of the hives, in such a manner that he could not fall, and, taking the reins into her own hands, jogged on as before.</div>

<div class="line_en">Prince required but slight attention, lacking energy for superfluous movements of any sort. With no longer a companion to distract her, Tess fell more deeply into reverie than ever, her back leaning against the hives.

The morning mail-cart, with its two noiseless wheels, speeding along these lanes like an arrow, as it always did, had driven into her slow and unlighted equipage. The pointed shaft of the cart had entered the breast of the unhappy Prince like a sword, and from the wound his life's blood was spouting in a stream, and falling with a hiss into the road.</div>

<div class="line_en">He mounted and sped on his way; while Tess stood and waited. The atmosphere turned pale, the birds shook themselves in the hedges, arose, and twittered; the lane showed all its white features, and Tess showed hers, still whiter. The huge pool of blood in front of her was already assuming the iridescence of coagulation; and when the sun rose a hundred prismatic hues were reflected from it. Prince lay alongside still and stark; his eyes half open, the hole in his chest looking scarcely large enough to have let out all that had animated him.</div>

He was harnessed to the waggon of beehives in the place of Prince, and the load taken on towards Casterbridge.</div>
