<div class="line_en">Much to his own dismay, Pippi De Lena decided to get married, not for love but for companionship. True, he had Cross, he had the cronies at the Xanadu Hotel, he had the Clericuzio Family and a vast network of relatives. True, he had three mistresses and he ate with good and sincere appetite; he enjoyed his golf and was down to a ten handicap, and he still loved to dance. But as the Don would say, he could go dancing to his coffin.</div>

<div class="line_en">So in his late fifties, robust in health, sanguine in temperament, rich, semiretired, he longed for a settled home life and perhaps a new batch of kids. Why not? The idea appealed to him more and more. Surprisingly, he yearned to be a father again. It would be fun to raise a daughter, he had loved Claudia as a child, though they no longer spoke. She had been so cunning and so forthright at the same time, and she had made her way in the world as a successful screenplay writer. And who knows, maybe someday they would make up. In some ways she was as stubborn as he was, so he under-stood her and he admired the way she stood up for what she believed in.</div>

<div class="line_en">After dropping off Cross at the airport, Pippi drove to New York City to spend a few days with his East Coast mistress. She was a good-looking brunette, a legal secretary with a sharp New York wit, and a great dancer. True, she had a tongue that lashed out, she loved to spend money, she would be an expensive wife. But she was too old, over forty-five. And she was too independent, a great quality for a mistress but not for the kind of marriage that Pippi would demand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="把克罗斯送到机场后，皮皮开车去纽约市，他准备找东海岸的情人待两天。她是个有着深色头发的美女法律秘书，有着纽约式的机智，舞跳得也好。她说话刻薄、喜欢花钱，肯定会是一个烧钱的太太。不过这些不是真正的问题。她已经过了四十五岁，不再年轻了。而且她也太独立，做情人是很妙，但是不是皮皮想要的那种太太。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was a pleasurable weekend with her, though she spent half the Sunday reading the Times. They ate in the finest restaurants, went dancing in the nightclubs, and had great sex in her apartment. But Pippi needed something more placid.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽然她周日有半天时间都在读《时代周刊》，但他们还是共度了一个愉快的周末。他们在最好的餐厅吃了饭，又去夜店跳舞，然后在她的公寓待了一晚。但是皮皮想要更加平静的夫妻生活。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Cross had lost the gamble he had taken in the movie business, but one way or another his future was assured. He still had the Xanadu and the Don would help him recover from the risk he had taken with his new venture. He was a good kid, but he was young and the young must take risks. That's what life was all about.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克罗斯在电影行业下的赌注输了，但是对他来说，此路不通也总有其他路能走通。他还有桃源酒店的产权，而且唐会帮他拿回这场豪赌里赔掉的部分。他是个好孩子，但还年轻，年轻人必须得承担风险。人生不就是这样嘛。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Pippi flew to Chicago. His mistress there was the sexual equivalent of that brawling city. She drank a little too much, she partied too exuberantly, she was happy-go-lucky and a lot of fun. But she was a little lazy, a little too messy, Pippi liked a clean home. Again, she was too old to start a family, at least forty, she said. But what the hell. Was he up to running around with a really young broad? After two days in Chicago, Pippi crossed her off the list.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="皮皮飞去芝加哥，他在那儿也有个情人，她的性感很衬这座喧嚣的城市。她喜欢酒和疯狂的聚会，她随遇而安而且相当有趣。但她有点懒，太过于邋遢。皮皮喜欢干净的家。真要组建家庭的话，她也太老了。她说自己最少也有四十岁。但是那又如何呢，他还真要和一个年轻女人过日子吗？在芝加哥待了两天，皮皮把她也划出了名单。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His best shot was his mistress in Los Angeles, and Pippi was pleased that he had geographically positioned them so neatly. There could be no accidental confrontations, no mental struggles in choosing between them. They served a certain purpose and they could not interfere with any temporary love affairs. Indeed, looking back, he was pleased at how he had conducted his life. Daring but prudent, brave but not foolhardy, loyal to the Family and rewarded by them. His only mistake had been in marrying a woman like Nalene, and even there, what woman could have given him more happiness for eleven years. And what man could boast of having made only one mistake in his lifetime? What was it the Don always said, It was OK to make mistakes in life as long as it was not a fatal mistake.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他最看好的是洛杉矶情人，皮皮对自己这种按照地区清晰安排情人的做法很是高兴。她们绝不会意外撞见，他也不用费心在她们之间做出抉择。她们都是他的情妇，但互不冲突。回首往事，他对自己的人生很满意。大胆而谨慎，勇敢但不莽撞，忠诚于家族也受到家族的奖励。他唯一的错误就是娶了娜莱内那样的女人，不过即便如此，娜莱内在那十一年中也给予了他独一无二的快乐。还有谁敢扬言这辈子只犯了一个错呢？唐挂在嘴边的那句话怎么说来着，人可以犯很多错，但绝不能犯要命的错。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">With both, he would have a problem settling them in Vegas. They were big-city women, and Vegas, Pippi knew in his heart, was really a hick cow town where casinos took the place of cattle. And there was no way that Pippi would live in any place but Vegas, for in Vegas nighttime did not exist. Electric neon banished all ghosts, the city shone like a rosy diamond in the desert at night, and after dawn the hot sun burned away all the wraiths that had escaped the neon.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="皮皮没把握说服她们任何一个定居拉斯维加斯。她们都是生活在大城市的女人，皮皮心里知道拉斯维加斯不过是个乡下小镇，唯一的区别只是用赌场换了牛棚。但是除了拉斯维加斯，皮皮不可能住在别的地方。这是因为拉斯维加斯是个不夜城。城市在夜晚熠熠生辉，电流驱走了所有的幽魂。好似沙漠中的玫瑰红宝石；而到黎明再现，炙热的天球又会烧尽昨夜幸免于霓虹灯的幽灵。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He decided to go directly to L. A. and not stop in Vegas. He called to notify Michelle that he was on his way and refused her offer to pick him up at the airport. "Just be ready for me when I get there," he told her. "I've been missing you. And I've got something important to tell you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他决定直接去洛杉矶，不在拉斯维加斯停留。他给米歇尔打了电话，说他已经在路上，而且拒绝她来接机。“准备一下，在家等我就行。”他告诉她，“我很想你，还有很重要的话要对你说。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Michelle was young enough, thirty-two, and she was more tender, more giving, more easy on the nerves, maybe because she had been born and raised in California. She was also good in bed, not that the others were not, for this was a primary qualification for Pippi. But she had no sharp edges, she wouldn't be trouble. She was a little kooky, she believed in New Age crap called channeling and being able to talk to spirits, and talked about all the past lives she had lived, but she could also be fun. Like many California beauties, she had dreamed of being an actress, but that had been knocked out of her head. She was completely wrapped up in yoga and channeling now, in physical health, running and going to the gym. And besides, she always complimented Pippi on his karma. For of course none of these women knew his true vocation. He was simply an administrative officer of the hotel association in Vegas.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="米歇尔够年轻，只有三十二岁，她更温柔，更愿意奉献，也没那么神经质，也许这都是因为她生长在加利福尼亚的缘故。她的床上功夫也不错，这不是说别人就不好，但这是皮皮选择妻子一条主要的考量标准。她没有棱角，不会让人烦心。可她有个怪癖，相信新纪元的胡说八道，什么通灵、灵魂沟通，总是谈论她前几辈子都干了什么。不过她也算是很有趣。和很多加利福尼亚美女一样，她也曾梦想过做个女演员，但是后来也就不做梦了。她现在把全副身心都投入到瑜伽和通灵里，锻炼身体、跑步、去健身房。而且她还经常夸奖皮皮的言行。当然，他的情人们都不知道他真正的职业，以为他是拉斯维加斯酒店联盟的行政主管。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Yes, with Michelle, he could stay in Vegas, they could keep an apartment in L. A. and when they got bored they could make the forty-minute flight to L. A. for a couple of weeks. And maybe to keep her busy, he would buy her a gift shop in the Hotel Xanadu. It could really work out. But what if she said no?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="是的，和米歇尔在一起，他可以住回拉斯维加斯，他们可以在洛杉矶买下一间公寓，在拉斯维加斯待腻了就坐四十分钟飞机去洛杉矶待两个星期。为了让她有事可做，也许他还可以给她买下一间礼品店来。这些都是可以实现的，不过，万一她拒绝他怎么办？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Something struck his memory: Nalene reading Goldilocks and the Three Bears when the children were small. He was just like Goldilocks. The New York woman was too hard, the Chicago woman was too soft, and the L. A. woman was just right. The thought gave him pleasure. Of course, in real life nothing was "just right."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有些事从记忆深处浮现出来，娜莱内在孩子们还小的时候，给他们读《金发姑娘和三只熊》，他不就是故事里金发姑娘的翻版吗？纽约的女人太强硬，芝加哥的女人太软弱，而洛杉矶的女人则刚刚好。他觉得这个想法很有意思。当然，现实生活中没有什么东西是“刚刚好”的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When he deplaned in L. A., he breathed in the balmy air of California, not even noticing the smog. He rented a car and drove first to Rodeo Drive, he loved to bring his women little gifts as a surprise and enjoyed walking down the street of fancy shops that held the luxuries of the world. He bought a gaudy wristwatch in the Gucci store; a purse in Fendi's, though he thought it ugly; a Hermès scarf; and some perfume in a bottle that looked like an expensive sculpture. When he bought a box of expensive lingerie, he was in such good spirits that he kidded the saleswoman, a young blonde, that it was for himself. The girl gave him one look and said, "Right…"</div>

<div class="line_en">Back in the car, three thousand dollars poorer, he headed for Santa Monica, the goodies in the passenger seat, gifts crammed into a gaily colored Gucci shopping bag. In Brentwood, he stopped in the Brentwood Mart, a favorite place. He loved the food stores that boxed an open square studded with picnic tables where you could have a cold drink and eat. The food on the plane had been terrible, and he was hungry. Michelle never kept food in the refrigerator because she was always dieting.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="回到车上时，身上已经少了三千美元，他开车去了圣莫妮卡，礼物放在客座，都用古驰颜色艳丽的购物袋装着。路过布伦特伍德时，他在布伦特伍德大超市停了车，这是他最喜欢的地方。他喜欢这里开放的广场，一圈都是食品店和露天餐桌，可以在桌上享用食物和冷饮。飞机餐不好吃，他饿了。米歇尔在节食，冰箱里从来都不会有食物。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In one store he bought two roast chickens, a dozen barbecued spareribs, and four hot dogs with all the trimmings. In another shop, he bought fresh baked white and rye bread. At an open stand he bought a huge glass of Coke and sat down at one of the picnic tables for a final moment of solitude. He ate two of the hot dogs, half of one of the roast chickens, and some French fries. He had never tasted anything so good. He sat in the golden light of the late afternoon sun in California, the sweet balmy air washed his face clean. He hated to leave but Michelle was waiting. She would be bathed and scented and a little tipsy and she would take him to bed immediately before he could even brush his teeth. He would propose to her before they started.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他在一家店里买了两份烤鸡、十二块烤排、四根配料十足的热狗，在另一家店买了新鲜出炉的白面包和黑麦面包，在一家露天摊位买了一大杯可乐。然后他坐在一张露天餐桌旁边，享受这最后一刻的独居生活。他吃了两根热狗、半份烤鸡、一些薯条，觉得自己好像从来没吃过这么好吃的东西。坐在加利福尼亚傍晚金色的斜阳里，甜美芬芳的气息拭过他的脸庞。他不想离开，但米歇尔已经在等了。她肯定已经洗了澡、喷了香水，还小酌了几杯，他一出现就会被立即拉到床上，连刷牙的时间都没有。在他们缠绵之前，他要求婚。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He drove to Santa Monica and stopped in front of Michelle's condo, which was in a two-story-high series of Spanish-looking bungalows. When he got out of the car he carried the two bags automatically in his left hand, leaving his right hand free. Out of habit, he surveyed the street up and down. It was lovely, no cars parked, the Spanish styles provided commodious driveways and a mildly religious benignity. The runners along the curbs were hidden by flowers and grass, the heavy-branched trees made a canopy against the descending sun.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他驱车前往圣莫妮卡市，停在米歇尔的公寓前。这是几幢西班牙风格的双层连体小别墅。他步出车门的时候，自然而然地把两个购物袋拎在左手，空出右手来。出于习惯，他四处看了看街面。景致很好，没有停着的车，西班牙风格的建筑略带几分宗教性的温厚，有宽敞的便道。人行道的边缘隐藏在花草中，枝繁叶茂的树木挡住了落日的余晖。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The shopping bag holding the food was decorated with type telling some fable about food, an intellectual shopping bag as befitted the intellectual clientele of the Mart. When he put it into the car, he read only the beginning line, "Fruit is the oldest product of human consumption. In the Garden of Eden…" Jesus, Pippi thought.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="装着食物的购物袋上写着几则关于食物的寓言，带着知识的购物袋正适合商场里有知识的客人。他把购物袋放上车，只顺便瞟了上面的第一行：“水果是人类最早消费的产品。在伊甸园…”瞎说八道，皮皮想。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Pippi now had to walk down a long alleyway whose wooden, green-painted fences were draped with roses. Michelle's apartment was in the back, a relic of the old Santa Monica, which was still bucolic. The buildings themselves were of seemingly old wood, and each separated swimming pool was adorned by white benches.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="皮皮得走过一段长长的甬道，甬道两边是刷成绿色的木质栅栏，栅栏上缀着玫瑰。米歇尔的公寓就在后面，是圣莫妮卡老城区的一处遗迹，还保留着田园风格。建筑群似乎是老旧的木头所造，每一个独立游泳池边上都放着几把白色的长椅。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He tried his best, knowing there was no mercy. He dropped the shopping bags and lunged forward, at the same time reaching for his gun. The man came forward to meet him, and Pippi in exultation reached for him. Six bullets carried his body into the air and flung it into a pillow of flowers at the foot of the green fence. He smelled their fragrance. He looked up at the man standing over him and said, "You fucking Santadio." Then the final bullet crashed into his skull. Pippi De Lena was no more.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他竭尽全力，知道这次必然无幸。他丢下购物袋向前猛冲，同时伸手拔枪。杀手也向他冲来，皮皮也全力扑过去。皮皮身中六发子弹，向后弹起，又狠狠地摔进绿色栅栏边上的一丛鲜花里。他闻到花朵的芬芳，抬头，看着伫立在跟前的杀手道：“你这桑塔迪奥家的狗。”最后一发子弹打穿了他的脑壳。皮皮·德·莱纳死了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Outside the alleyway, far down the other end, Pippi heard the growling motor of a stationary vehicle. It alerted him, he was always alert. At the same moment he caught sight of a man rising from one of the benches. He was so surprised that he said, "What the fuck are you doing here?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="皮皮突然听见甬道外边有汽车发动机“嗡嗡”的空转声。他顿时警惕起来，他向来都很警觉。同一时刻，他看见一个男人从长椅上站起身。他诧异万分，不假思索道：“你他妈怎么跑这儿来了？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The man's hand did not come out to greet him and in that instant everything was clear to Pippi. He knew what was going to happen. His brain processed so much information that he could not react. He saw the gun appear, so small and inoffensive, saw the tension on the killer's face. Understood for the first time the look on the faces of men he had put to death, their supreme astonishment that life was at an end. And he understood that finally he would have to pay the price for living his life. He even thought briefly that the killer had planned badly, that this was not how he would have done it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那个男人并没有要跟他握手的意思，皮皮恍然大悟了。他知道要发生什么。那么多信息全都涌现在他脑海里，让他完全来不及反应。他看见对方掏出了枪——看上去小巧无害，他看见杀手的脸上神情紧张。他第一次明白了死于他手的人们脸上的表情，他第一次明白了那种生命行将终结的极度震惊，他也明白这次是在劫难逃，报应来了。他心里甚至还闪过一个念头，杀手的计划有瑕疵，要是换成他，就不会这么干。">查看中文翻译</div>
