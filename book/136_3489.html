<div class="line_en">If there was hope, it must lie in the proles, because only there, in those swarming disregarded masses, 85 per cent of the population of Oceania, could the force to destroy the Party ever be generated. The Party could not be overthrown from within. Its enemies, if it had any enemies, had no way of coming together or even of identifying one another. Even if the legendary Brotherhood existed, as just possibly it might, it was inconceivable that its members could ever assemble in larger numbers than twos and threes. Rebellion meant a look in the eyes, an inflection of the voice; at the most, an occasional whispered word. But the proles, if only they could somehow become conscious of their own strength, would have no need to conspire. They needed only to rise up and shake themselves like a horse shaking off flies. If they chose they could blow the Party to pieces tomorrow morning. Surely sooner or later it must occur to them to do it? And yet --</div>

<div class="line_en">He remembered how once he had been walking down a crowded street when a tremendous shout of hundreds of voices -- women's voices -- had burst from a side-street a little way ahead. It was a great formidable cry of anger and despair, a deep loud "Oh-o-o-o-oh!" that went humming on like the reverberation of a bell. His heart had leapt. It's started! he had thought. A riot! The proles are breaking loose at last! When he had reached the spot it was to see a mob of two or three hundred women crowding round the stalls of a street market, with faces as tragic as though they had been the doomed passengers on a sinking ship. But at this moment the general despair broke down into a multitude of individual quarrels. It appeared that one of the stalls had been selling tin saucepans. They were wretched, flimsy things, but cooking-pots of any kind were always difficult to get. Now the supply had unexpectedly given out. The successful women, bumped and jostled by the rest, were trying to make off with their saucepans while dozens of others clamoured round the stall, accusing the stall-keeper of favouritism and of having more saucepans somewhere in reserve. There was a fresh outburst of yells. Two bloated women, one of them with her hair coming down, had got hold of the same saucepan and were trying to tear it out of one another's hands. For a moment they were both tugging, and then the handle came off. Winston watched them disgustedly. And yet, just for a moment, what almost frightening power had sounded in that cry from only a few hundred throats! Why was it that they could never shout like that about anything that mattered?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他记得有一次走过一条拥挤的街道，几百个人发出巨大的喊声——女人的声音——是从前面一条小街爆发出来的。这是一种愤怒和绝望的极为恐怖的喊叫，一种咆哮“噢——噢——噢！”像钟声般久久回荡。他的心猛烈跳动。事情开始了！他想。一场暴动！无产者终于挣脱了束缚！当他走到那个地方，看到两三百个女人围住一家商铺，脸色悲哀，就像她们是一条沉船上的倒霉的旅客。但此时此刻，众人的绝望分化为各种各样的个人争吵。原来是有一个摊位在卖锡锅。都是些一碰就破的廉价货，尽管如此，不论是什么锅子都很难买到。眼看货就要卖完了。幸运的女人被别人推着挤着，她们拿着锅子急于往外走，而另外几十个女人围着摊位叫嚷，指责摊主有私心，囤着锅子不卖。又爆发出一阵吼叫。两个肥胖的女人，其中一个披头散发，抓住一只锅子，竭力想要从另一个女人的手里夺过来。她们两个同时用力拉着，锅柄被拉掉了。温斯顿厌恶地看着她们。然而，片刻之间，区区几百个喉咙里发出的声音听起来具有多么可怕的力量！为什么她们不在有意义的事情上发出同样的呐喊呢？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他写道：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That, he reflected, might almost have been a transcription from one of the Party textbooks. The Party claimed, of course, to have liberated the proles from bondage. Before the Revolution they had been hideously oppressed by the capitalists, they had been starved and flogged, women had been forced to work in the coal mines (women still did work in the coal mines, as a matter of fact), children had been sold into the factories at the age of six. But simultaneously, true to the principles of doublethink, the Party taught that the proles were natural inferiors who must be kept in subjection, like animals, by the application of a few simple rules. In reality very little was known about the proles. It was not necessary to know much. So long as they continued to work and breed, their other activities were without importance. Left to themselves, like cattle turned loose upon the plains of Argentina, they had reverted to a style of life that appeared to be natural to them, a sort of ancestral pattern. They were born, they grew up in the gutters, they went to work at twelve, they passed through a brief blossoming-period of beauty and sexual desire, they married at twenty, they were middle-aged at thirty, they died, for the most part, at sixty. Heavy physical work, the care of home and children, petty quarrels with neighbours, films, football, beer and, above all, gambling, filled up the horizon of their minds. To keep them in control was not difficult. A few agents of the Thought Police moved always among them, spreading false rumours and marking down and eliminating the few individuals who were judged capable of becoming dangerous; but no attempt was made to indoctrinate them with the ideology of the Party. It was not desirable that the proles should have strong political feelings. All that was required of them was a primitive patriotism which could be appealed to whenever it was necessary to make them accept longer working-hours or shorter rations. And even when they became discontented, as they sometimes did, their discontent led nowhere, because, being without general ideas, they could only focus it on petty specific grievances. The larger evils invariably escaped their notice. The great majority of proles did not even have telescreens in their homes. Even the civil police interfered with them very little. There was a vast amount of criminality in London, a whole world-within-a-world of thieves, bandits, prostitutes, drug-peddlers and racketeers of every description; but since it all happened among the proles themselves, it was of no importance. In all questions of morals they were allowed to follow their ancestral code. The sexual puritanism of the Party was not imposed upon them. Promiscuity went unpunished, divorce was permitted. For that matter, even religious worship would have been permitted if the proles had shown any sign of needing or wanting it. They were beneath suspicion. As the Party slogan put it: "Proles and animals are free."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他想，这几乎就是党的一本教材中的描述。当然，党声称将无产者从束缚中解放出来。革命前，他们受资本家可怕的压迫，他们挨饿、被鞭打，女人被迫去煤矿干活（事实上，妇女现在仍然在煤矿工作），儿童六岁就被卖到工厂。但同时，根据双重思想的原则，党教导人们，无产者天然地处于劣势，像动物一样，运用一些简单的法则，就可以使他们保持服从。事实上，人们对无产者所知甚少。没有必要知道得更多。只要他们不断地工作和生育，他们的其他活动就无关紧要。听任他们自己生存，就像将牛群放到阿根廷平原上，他们会找到适合他们天性的生活方式，一种原始的生活方式。他们出生，他们在水沟里长大，他们到了十二岁就去工作，他们有过短暂的情窦初开的美丽花季，二十岁时结婚，三十岁进入中年，大多数在六十岁时死去。繁重的体力活、照顾家庭和孩子、与邻居吵嘴、电影、足球、啤酒，尤其是赌博，占据了他们的心灵。要控制他们并不难。一些思想警察一直在他们中间活动，散布谣言，将经判断有可能成为危险分子的少数个人记下来并加以清除，但并不努力向他们灌输党的意识形态。也并不希望无产者拥有强烈的政治热情。对他们的全部要求就是一种原始爱国主义，一旦需要就以这种爱国主义打动他们，使他们接受长时间的工作和较低的配额。即使他们有时会感到不满，他们的不满也毫无结果，因为，没有思想意识，他们只能就一些细小的事情发发牢骚。更大的目标总是逃离他们的注意。绝大部分无产者的家里甚至没有电幕。就连民警也很少干预他们。伦敦有很多的犯罪案件，各式各样的小偷、强盗、妓女、毒品贩子和诈骗者，但既然这些都发生在无产者中间，就无关紧要。在道德的所有层面上，他们被允许遵循他们祖先的法则。党的性道德并不加于他们身上。乱交并不受惩罚，离婚也是允许的。就此而言，甚至宗教崇拜也是可以的，只要他们需要。他们不受怀疑。正如党的口号所说：“无产者和动物都是自由的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

It was a dark, dirty, miserable place where hardly anybody had enough to eat and where hundreds and thousands of poor people had no boots on their feet and not even a roof to sleep under. Children no older than you are had to work twelve hours a day for cruel masters, who flogged them with whips if they worked too slowly and fed them on nothing but stale breadcrusts and water. But in among all this terrible poverty there were just a few great big beautiful houses that were lived in by rich men who had as many as thirty servants to look after them. These rich men were called capitalists. They were fat, ugly men with wicked faces, like the one in the picture on the opposite page. You can see that he is dressed in a long black coat which was called a frock coat, and a queer, shiny hat shaped like a stovepipe, which was called a top hat. This was the uniform of the capitalists, and no one else was allowed to wear it. The capitalists owned everything in the world, and everyone else was their slave. They owned all the land, all the houses, all the factories, and all the money. If anyone disobeyed them they could throw him into prison, or they could take his job away and starve him to death.

<div class="line_en">How could you tell how much of it was lies? It might be true that the average human being was better off now than he had been before the Revolution. The only evidence to the contrary was the mute protest in your own bones, the instinctive feeling that the conditions you lived in were intolerable and that at some other time they must have been different. It struck him that the truly characteristic thing about modern life was not its cruelty and insecurity, but simply its bareness, its dinginess, its listlessness. Life, if you looked about you, bore no resemblance not only to the lies that streamed out of the telescreens, but even to the ideals that the Party was trying to achieve. Great areas of it, even for a Party member, were neutral and non-political, a matter of slogging through dreary jobs, fighting for a place on the Tube, darning a worn-out sock, cadging a saccharine tablet, saving a cigarette end. The ideal set up by the Party was something huge, terrible and glittering -- a world of steel and concrete, of monstrous machines and terrifying weapons -- a nation of warriors and fanatics, marching forward in perfect unity, all thinking the same thoughts and shouting the same slogans, perpetually working, fighting, triumphing, persecuting -- three hundred million people all with the same face. The reality was decaying, dingy cities where underfed people shuffled to and fro in leaky shoes, in patched-up nineteenth-century houses that smelt always of cabbage and bad lavatories. He seemed to see a vision of London, vast and ruinous, city of a million dustbins, and mixed up with it was a picture of Mrs Parsons, a woman with lined face and wispy hair, fiddling helplessly with a blocked wastepipe.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="你怎么分辨这是不是谎言。这可能是真的，现在普通人的生活要好过革命前。唯一与此相反的证据就是你内心深处的无声的反抗，一种直感，你的生活条件是难以忍受的，而在其他的时代，它们必定是不一样的。他想到，现代生活的真正特质不在于它的残酷和危险，而是它的毫无特色、肮脏不堪、无精打采。你看一下周边，生活不仅丝毫不同于电幕中滔滔不绝的谎言，甚至也不同于党努力要达到的理想。甚至对一个党员来说，生活的大部分内容是中性和非政治性的：艰难地熬过沉闷的工作、在地铁车厢争一个位子、补一只破袜子、讨一粒糖精片、节省一支香烟头。党树立的理想目标是庞大、可怕和华丽的——一个钢铁水泥、大型机器、致命武器的世界——一个由战争狂人和极端分子组成的国家，步伐整齐地向前行进，思想一致，喊着同样的口号，人们永远在工作、战斗、获胜、迫害——三亿人民有着同一张面孔。而现实却是，在污秽的城市中，营养不良的人们穿着破鞋步履蹒跚，破旧的十九世纪住宅内，总是闻到一股烂白菜和厕所的臭味。他像是看到伦敦的一种景象：空旷而破败，一百万个垃圾箱，与这一景象混杂的是帕森斯太太的形象，一个满脸皱纹的女人，头发枯黄，无助地拾掇着堵塞的下水管道。">查看中文翻译</div>

Day and night the telescreens bruised your ears with statistics proving that people today had more food, more clothes, better houses, better recreations -- that they lived longer, worked shorter hours, were bigger, healthier, stronger, happier, more intelligent, better educated, than the people of fifty years ago. Not a word of it could ever be proved or disproved. The Party claimed, for example, that today forty per cent of adult proles were literate: before the Revolution, it was said, the number had only been fifteen per cent. The Party claimed that the infant mortality rate was now only a hundred and sixty per thousand, whereas before the Revolution it had been three hundred -- and so it went on. It was like a single equation with two unknowns. It might very well be that literally every word in the history books, even the things that one accepted without question, was pure fantasy.

By 1970 none of them was left, except Big Brother himself. All the rest had by that time been exposed as traitors and counter-revolutionaries. Goldstein had fled and was hiding no one knew where, and of the others, a few had simply disappeared, while the majority had been executed after spectacular public trials at which they made confession of their crimes. Among the last survivors were three men named Jones, Aaronson and Rutherford. It must have been in 1965 that these three had been arrested. As often happened, they had vanished for a year or more, so that one did not know whether they were alive or dead, and then had suddenly been brought forth to incriminate themselves in the usual way. They had confessed to intelligence with the enemy (at that date, too, the enemy was Eurasia), embezzlement of public funds, the murder of various trusted Party members, intrigues against the leadership of Big Brother which had started long before the Revolution happened, and acts of sabotage causing the death of hundreds of thousands of people. After confessing to these things they had been pardoned, re-instated in the Party and given posts which were in fact sinecures but which sounded important.

<div class="line_en">Some time after their release Winston had actually seen all three of them in the Chestnut Tree Café. He remembered the sort of terrified fascination with which he had watched them out of the corner of his eye. They were men far older than himself, relics of the ancient world, almost the last great figures left over from the heroic early days of the Party. The glamour of the underground struggle and the civil war still faintly clung to them. He had the feeling, though already at that time facts and dates were growing blurry, that he had known their names years earlier than he had known that of Big Brother. But also they were outlaws, enemies, untouchables, doomed with absolute certainty to extinction within a year or two. No one who had once fallen into the hands of the Thought Police ever escaped in the end. They were corpses waiting to be sent back to the grave.</div>

<div class="line_en">There was no one at any of the tables nearest to them. It was not wise even to be seen in the neighbourhood of such people. They were sitting in silence before glasses of the gin flavoured with cloves which was the speciality of the café. Of the three, it was Rutherford whose appearance had most impressed Winston. Rutherford had once been a famous caricaturist, whose brutal cartoons had helped to inflame popular opinion before and during the Revolution. Even now, at long intervals, his cartoons were appearing in the Times. They were simply an imitation of his earlier manner, and curiously lifeless and unconvincing. Always they were a rehashing of the ancient themes -- slum tenements, starving children, street battles, capitalists in top hats -- even on the barricades the capitalists still seemed to cling to their top hats -- an endless, hopeless effort to get back into the past. He was a monstrous man, with a mane of greasy grey hair, his face pouched and seamed, with thick negroid lips. At one time he must have been immensely strong; now his great body was sagging, sloping, bulging, falling away in every direction. He seemed to be breaking up before one's eyes, like a mountain crumbling.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was the lonely hour of fifteen. Winston could not now remember how he had come to be in the café at such a time. The place was almost empty. A tinny music was trickling from the telescreens. The three men sat in their corner almost motionless, never speaking. Uncommanded, the waiter brought fresh glasses of gin. There was a chessboard on the table beside them, with the pieces set out but no game started. And then, for perhaps half a minute in all, something happened to the telescreens. The tune that they were playing changed, and the tone of the music changed too. There came into it -- but it was something hard to describe. It was a peculiar, cracked, braying, jeering note: in his mind Winston called it a yellow note. And then a voice from the telescreen was singing:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是下午三点这个寂寞的时辰。温斯顿现在不记得为何在这个时间去这家咖啡馆。室内几乎空荡荡的。电幕上放着轻柔的音乐。那三个人坐在他们的那个角落，几乎一动不动，也不说话。不等吩咐，侍者就端去大杯的杜松子酒。他们身旁的桌子上放着一个棋盘，上面摆着棋子，但没有人下棋。这时，也许过了半分钟，电幕上有什么事发生了。他们正在播的音乐变了调子。突如其来，但又难于描述。这是一种怪异的、沙哑的、刺耳的、嘲弄的调子；温斯顿私下叫它黄调子。接着电幕上传出唱歌的声音：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The three men never stirred. But when Winston glanced again at Rutherford's ruinous face, he saw that his eyes were full of tears. And for the first time he noticed, with a kind of inward shudder, and yet not knowing at what he shuddered, that both Aaronson and Rutherford had broken noses.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这三个人从不激动。但当温斯顿再看卢瑟福德死气沉沉的脸时，他看见他的眼睛里充满了泪水。他第一次注意到，阿伦森和卢瑟福德的鼻梁断了，心中不禁一阵战栗，然而不知道自己因何战栗。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A little later all three were re-arrested. It appeared that they had engaged in fresh conspiracies from the very moment of their release. At their second trial they confessed to all their old crimes over again, with a whole string of new ones. They were executed, and their fate was recorded in the Party histories, a warning to posterity. About five years after this, in 1973, Winston was unrolling a wad of documents which had just flopped out of the pneumatic tube onto his desk when he came on a fragment of paper which had evidently been slipped in among the others and then forgotten. The instant he had flattened it out he saw its significance. It was a half-page torn out of the Times of about ten years earlier -- the top half of the page, so that it included the date -- and it contained a photograph of the delegates at some Party function in New York. Prominent in the middle of the group were Jones, Aaronson and Rutherford. There was no mistaking them; in any case their names were in the caption at the bottom.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不久，他们三个重新被捕。好像是他们一获释就参与了新的阴谋。在第二次受审中，他们又招认了先前犯过的所有罪行，以及一系列新的罪行。他们被处决了，他们的命运记载在党史中，以警示后人。大约五年后，一九七三年，温斯顿打开刚通过气压输送管发送到他桌子上的一份文献，发现一张纸片，这张纸片显然是临时夹在文献中，之后就忘记了。他把纸片一摊开，就意识到了它的重要性。这是从大约十年前的《泰晤士报》上撕下来的半张报纸——是报纸的上半张，所以它上面有日期——包括党代表团在纽约的某次社交活动的照片。引人注目的是，代表团中间是琼斯、阿伦森和卢瑟福德。一点没错，是他们；反正他们的名字出现在照片下面的说明文字中。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The point was that at both trials all three men had confessed that on that date they had been on Eurasian soil. They had flown from a secret airfield in Canada to a rendezvous somewhere in Siberia, and had conferred with members of the Eurasian General Staff, to whom they had betrayed important military secrets. The date had stuck in Winston's memory because it chanced to be midsummer day; but the whole story must be on record in countless other places as well. There was only one possible conclusion: the confessions were lies.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="问题在于，两次审判中三人都招认，那天他们都在欧亚国境内。他们从加拿大的一个秘密机场飞抵西伯利亚的一个约会地点，和欧亚国总参谋部成员举行会谈，向他们出卖了重要的军事机密。温斯顿之所以记住了这个日子，因为那天恰好是夏至；但这整个的事情应该另有记载。否则只能得出一个结论：他们屈打成招。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Of course, this was not in itself a discovery. Even at that time Winston had not imagined that the people who were wiped out in the purges had actually committed the crimes that they were accused of. But this was concrete evidence; it was a fragment of the abolished past, like a fossil bone which turns up in the wrong stratum and destroys a geological theory. It was enough to blow the Party to atoms, if in some way it could have been published to the world and its significance made known.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当然，这件事本身并不是什么新发现。甚至在当时，温斯顿就不相信这些在清洗中被扫地出门的人会犯指控他们的那些罪行。但这张报纸却是确凿的证据；这是被抹掉的过去的一个残片，像是一块骨化石，突然出现在错误的地层中，推翻了某种地质学理论。这足以将党炸成碎片，如果它以某种方式公布于世，它的重要性为人所知的话。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He had gone straight on working. As soon as he saw what the photograph was, and what it meant, he had covered it up with another sheet of paper. Luckily, when he unrolled it, it had been upside-down from the point of view of the telescreen.</div>

<div class="line_en">That was ten -- eleven years ago. Today, probably, he would have kept that photograph. It was curious that the fact of having held it in his fingers seemed to him to make a difference even now, when the photograph itself, as well as the event it recorded, was only memory. Was the Party's hold upon the past less strong, he wondered, because a piece of evidence which existed no longer had once existed?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是十年或十一年前的事。今天，他可能保留那张照片。奇怪的是，他握有证据这件事现在看似乎有不同的意义，照片本身，还有它记录的事件只存在记忆中了。他心想，难道党对过去的控制不那么牢固了，就因为不再存在的一份证据曾经存在过？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He took his scribbling pad on his knee and pushed back his chair, so as to get as far away from the telescreen as possible. To keep your face expressionless was not difficult, and even your breathing could be controlled, with an effort: but you could not control the beating of your heart, and the telescreen was quite delicate enough to pick it up. He let what he judged to be ten minutes go by, tormented all the while by the fear that some accident -- a sudden draught blowing across his desk, for instance -- would betray him. Then, without uncovering it again, he dropped the photograph into the memory hole, along with some other waste papers. Within another minute, perhaps, it would have crumbled into ashes.</div>

<div class="line_en">But today, supposing that it could be somehow resurrected from its ashes, the photograph might not even be evidence. Already, at the time when he made his discovery, Oceania was no longer at war with Eurasia, and it must have been to the agents of Eastasia that the three dead men had betrayed their country. Since then there had been other charges -- two, three, he could not remember how many. Very likely the confessions had been re-written and re-written until the original facts and dates no longer had the smallest significance. The past not only changed, but changed continuously. What most afflicted him with the sense of nightmare was that he had never clearly understood why the huge imposture was undertaken. The immediate advantages of falsifying the past were obvious, but the ultimate motive was mysterious. He took up his pen again and wrote:</div>

<div class="line_en">He wondered, as he had many times wondered before, whether he himself was a lunatic. Perhaps a lunatic was simply a minority of one. At one time it had been a sign of madness to believe that the earth goes round the sun: today, to believe that the past is unalterable. He might be alone in holding that belief, and if alone, then a lunatic. But the thought of being a lunatic did not greatly trouble him: the horror was that he might also be wrong.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他想，就像他以前多次想过，他自己是否精神错乱了。也许所谓精神错乱只是得不到任何支持而已。曾几何时，相信地球绕着太阳转是疯狂的标志；今天，相信过去是不可更改的也是疯狂的标志。他可能是唯一持那种信念的人，如果他是唯一的，他就是一个精神错乱者。想到自己是一个精神错乱者并不让他因此而苦恼，让他恐惧的是他也可能是错的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He picked up the children's history book and looked at the portrait of Big Brother which formed its frontispiece. The hypnotic eyes gazed into his own. It was as though some huge force were pressing down upon you -- something that penetrated inside your skull, battering against your brain, frightening you out of your beliefs, persuading you, almost, to deny the evidence of your senses. In the end the Party would announce that two and two made five, and you would have to believe it. It was inevitable that they should make that claim sooner or later: the logic of their position demanded it. Not merely the validity of experience, but the very existence of external reality, was tacitly denied by their philosophy. The heresy of heresies was common sense. And what was terrifying was not that they would kill you for thinking otherwise, but that they might be right. For, after all, how do we know that two and two make four? Or that the force of gravity works? Or that the past is unchangeable? If both the past and the external world exist only in the mind, and if the mind itself is controllable -- what then?</div>
