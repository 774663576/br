<div class="line_en">The castle dominated the broad fertile valley that maps and men alike called Blackwood Vale. A vale it was, beyond a doubt, but no wood had grown here for several thousand years, be it black or brown or green. Once, yes, but axes had long since cleared the trees away. Homes and mills and holdfasts had risen where once the oaks stood tall. The ground was bare and muddy, and dotted here and there with drifts of melting snow.</div>

<div class="line_en">Raventree Hall was old. Moss grew thick between its ancient stones, spiderwebbing up its walls like the veins in a crone's legs. Two huge towers flanked the castle's main gate, and smaller ones defended every angle of its walls. All were square. Drum towers and half-moons held up better against catapults, since thrown stones were more apt to deflect off a curved wall, but Raventree predated that particular bit of builder's wisdom.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="鸦树城历史悠久。古老砖石的缝隙中长满了厚厚的苔藓，城墙上密布的蜘蛛网就像是干瘪的老妇人腿上的血管。城堡正门的两侧耸立着两座巨大的塔楼，几座小塔楼则守护着城墙的每个拐角。所有塔楼都是正方形。圆形突出于外墙的鼓楼和半月形突出于城墙的塔楼更有利于防御投石机的攻击，因为弧形能更有效的反射飞石，但是显然鸦树城比建筑师积累起这条特殊智慧的年代更为久远。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Inside the castle walls, however, a bit of the forest still remained. House Blackwood kept the old gods, and worshiped as the First Men had in the days before the Andals came to Westeros. Some of the trees in their godswood were said to be as old as Raventree's square towers, especially the heart tree, a weirwood of colossal size whose upper branches could be seen from leagues away, like bony fingers scratching at the sky.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而在城墙里面，还保留有一片小小的树林。布莱克伍德家族守护着旧神，像安达尔人来到维斯特洛大陆之前的先民一样敬仰旧神。他们的神木林中，有些树木据说和鸦树城的方形城塔一样古老。尤其是心树，巨大的鱼梁木树枝像瘦骨嶙峋的手指一般伸向天空，最上方的枝条甚至在几里格以外都能看见。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">No great hosts encircled Raventree, as Riverrun had been encircled. This siege was a more intimate affair, the latest step in a dance that went back many centuries. At best Jonos Bracken had five hundred men about the castle. Jaime saw no siege towers, no battering rams, no catapults. Bracken did not mean to break the gates of Raventree nor storm its high, thick walls. With no prospect of relief in sight, he was content to starve his rival out. No doubt there had been sorties and skirmishes at the start of the siege, and arrows flying back and forth; half a year into it, everyone was too tired for such nonsense. Boredom and routine had taken over, the enemies of discipline.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="和前一段奔流城的情况相比，鸦树城并没有受到强有力的包围。这次围攻显得更像是家庭事务，而上一次发生此类事件可以追溯到好几百年之前。裘诺斯？布雷肯在城堡周围最多只有五百人，而且詹姆没看见攻击塔楼、投石机和弓弩。看来布雷肯并无攻破鸦树城大门或者冲击高墙的打算，眼看这座城堡没有被救援的希望，他满足的期待着把敌人饿死在里面。毫无疑问，在围困的初期这里有过突围和小规模的战斗，双方箭来箭往，但是半年过去，每个人都为这种毫无意义的行为感到疲倦。取而代之的只有厌倦和单调的例行公事，而这些正是维持军纪的天敌。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As Jaime Lannister and his escort wound through the rolling hills into the vale, little remained of the fields and farms and orchards that had once surrounded Raventree -- only mud and ashes, and here and there the blackened shells of homes and mills. Weeds and thorns and nettles grew in that wasteland, but nothing that could be called a crop. Everywhere Jaime looked he saw his father's hand, even in the bones they sometimes glimpsed beside the road. Most were sheep bones, but there were horses too, and cattle, and now and again a human skull, or a headless skeleton with weeds poking up through its rib cage.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="詹姆和他的卫队逶迤前行，穿过连绵起伏的丘陵进入谷地，曾经环绕鸦树城的土地、农场和果园已经消亡殆尽——只剩下泥土和灰烬，以及四处散落的烧焦的房屋和磨坊的断壁残垣。废墟上生长着野草、荆棘和荨麻，除了这些以外，连一点庄稼都没有。路边时而出现一撇而过的尸骨，哪怕是在这些尸骨上，詹姆都能感觉到父亲那双曾经无情扫过这片土地的巨手无处不在。尸骨中的多数是绵羊骨头，但是也有马的、牛的，以及不时出现的人头骨，或者肋骨中已经长出野草的无头骨架。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He would have to face her, he supposed. Assuming the High Septon had not put her to death by the time he got back to the city. "Come at once," she had written, in the letter he'd had Peck burn at Riverrun. "Help me. Save me. I need you now as I have never needed you before. I love you. I love you. I love you. Come at once." Her need was real enough, Jaime did not doubt. As for the rest… she's been fucking Lancel and Osmund Kettleblack and Moon Boy for all I know… Even if he had gone back, he could not hope to save her. She was guilty of every treason laid against her, and he was short a sword hand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他必须得面对她，他想。姑且认为当他回去的时候她还没有死在大主教手里。“立刻回来吧，”她在信中写道，那封他在奔流城让小派烧掉的信。“帮助我。拯救我。我比任何时候都更需要你。我爱你，我爱你，我爱你。立刻回来吧。”她确实需要他，詹姆毫不怀疑。至于其他的…就我所知，她和蓝赛尔、奥斯蒙？凯特布莱克，甚至，月童上床…然而即使他赶回去了，他也不指望救得了她。她确实犯下了他们指控的每一项叛国罪，而他少了握剑的那只手。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When the column came trotting from the fields, the sentries stared at them with more curiosity than fear. No one sounded the alarm, which suited Jaime well enough. Lord Bracken's pavilion did not prove difficult to find. It was the largest in the camp, and the best sited; sitting atop a low rise beside a stream, it commanded a clear view of two of Raventree's gates.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="詹姆的卫队快步行进穿过田间，对方哨兵看着他们的眼神里，好奇多过恐惧。非常配合詹姆的是，并没有人发出警报。布雷肯伯爵的帐篷并不难找，因为那是营地里最大并且位置最好的一个，坐落于小溪边一块平缓丘陵的顶部，对鸦树城的两座大门有着非常清晰的视野。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Past time this was ended, thought Jaime Lannister. With Riverrun now safely in Lannister hands, Raventree was the remnant of the Young Wolf's short-lived kingdom. Once it yielded, his work along the Trident would be done, and he would be free to return to King's Landing. To the king, he told himself, but another part of him whispered, to Cersei.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一切都已结束，詹姆心想。随着奔流城安稳地落入兰尼斯特手中，鸦树城就成了少狼主那短命王国最后的领土。一旦它投降，詹姆在三河流域的差事就结束了，然后他就可以回到君临。回到国王身边，他对自己说，但是身体里另一部分自己轻声低语，回到瑟曦身边。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They were well and truly at it when he entered, so intent on their rutting that neither took any note of his arrival. The woman had her eyes closed. Her hands clutched the coarse brown hair on Bracken's back. She gasped every time he drove into her. His lordship's head was buried in her breasts, his hands locked around her hips.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当他进去的时候，他们正干得很专注。专注到两人谁都没注意到他的到来。女人紧闭双眼，双手揪住布雷肯背后粗糙的棕色毛发。每次他进入她，她都发出重重的喘息。伯爵大人将头埋在她的双乳间，双手环绕着她的臀部。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The tent was brown, like the standard flapping from its center pole, where the red stallion of House Bracken reared upon its gold escutcheon. Jaime gave the order to dismount and told his men that they might mingle if they liked. "Not you two," he said to his banner-bearers. "Stay close. This will not keep me long." Jaime vaulted down off Honor and strode to Bracken's tent, his sword rattling in its scabbard.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="帐篷是棕色的，中心旗杆上飘扬着同样棕底的布雷肯家族的金盾红色骏马旗帜。詹姆命令下马，并且告诉他的兵如果愿意的话可以跟布雷肯的士兵套套近乎。“除了你们俩，”他对他的旗手说，“在这呆着，我不会进去很长时间。”詹姆跳下“荣誉”，大步迈进布雷肯的帐篷，腰上的配剑在剑鞘里发出金属碰撞的声响。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Talk. Aye." Lord Jonos sheathed his sword. He was not quite so tall as Jaime, but he was heavier, with thick shoulders and arms that would have made a blacksmith envious. Brown stubble covered his cheeks and chin. His eyes were brown as well, the anger in them poorly hidden. "You took me unawares, my lord. I was not told of your coming."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“聊聊…可以。”裘诺斯伯爵还剑入鞘。他没有詹姆那么高，但是块头更大，宽厚的肩膀和粗壮的手臂会让铁匠都感到嫉妒。棕色的胡茬爬满了他的面颊和下巴。眼睛也是棕色的，里面透出隐藏不住的怒气。“你让我措手不及，大人。我可没接到您要过来的通知。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You been looking at my turnips since you came in, ser." The woman found the blanket and pulled it up high enough to cover herself to the waist, then raised one hand to push her hair back from her eyes. "And they're not for sale, neither."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“从你进来起就在盯着我的芜菁看了，爵士。”女人找到一张毯子，把它拉起来盖到自己腰部，然后伸出一只手拨开遮住眼睛的长发，“而且它们并不出售。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"And I seem to have prevented yours." Jaime smiled at the woman in the bed. She had one hand over her left breast and the other between her legs, which left her right breast exposed. Her nipples were darker than Cersei's and thrice the size. When she felt Jaime's gaze she covered her right nipple, but that revealed her mound. "Are all camp followers so modest?" he wondered. "If a man wants to sell his turnips, he needs to set them out."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我似乎也坏了你的好事。”詹姆对床上的女人笑了笑。她用一只手护住左胸，另一只手挡在两腿之间，于是右胸便赤裸在外。她的乳头比瑟曦的颜色要深，而且个头大三倍。她感觉到詹姆的注视，立刻伸手遮住右胸，结果又把她的三角地露了出来。“所有营妓都是这么害羞吗？”他问道。“如果有人想卖芜菁，最好把它们摆出来。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"She's a prize of war." Bracken retrieved his breeches from the floor and shook them out. "She belonged to one of Blackwood's sworn swords till I split his head in two. Put your hands down, woman. My lord of Lannister wants a proper look at those teats."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“她是个战利品。”布雷肯从地上捡起他的马裤抖了抖，“本属于布莱克伍德家的一个效忠骑士，直到我把他的脑袋砍成了两半。把手放下，女人。兰尼斯特大人想好好看看你的乳头。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jaime ignored that. "You are putting those breeches on backwards, my lord," he told Bracken. As Jonos cursed, the woman slipped off the bed to snatch up her scattered clothing, her fingers fluttering nervously between her breasts and cleft as she bent and turned and reached. Her efforts to conceal herself were oddly provocative, far more so than if she'd simply gone about the business naked. "Do you have a name, woman?" he asked her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="詹姆对此置若罔闻，“你把裤子穿反了，大人。”他对布雷肯说。当裘诺斯大声咒骂的时候，女人滑下床，捡回她散乱的到处都是的衣服。当她弯腰、转身和伸手拾捡的时候，手指紧张地在双乳和私处间抖动。她努力地把身体遮起来，却比直接赤裸着跑出去更显出一种古怪地刺激。“你叫什么名字，女人？”詹姆问她。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"My mother named me Hildy, ser." She pulled a soiled shift down over her head and shook her hair out. Her face was almost as dirty as her feet and she had enough hair between her legs to pass for Bracken's sister, but there was something appealing about her all the same. That pug nose, her shaggy mane of hair… or the way she did a little curtsy after she had stepped into her skirt. "Have you seen my other shoe, m'lord?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我妈叫我希尔蒂，爵士。”她把一件脏裙子从头上套了进去，再从领口甩出长发。她的脸和脚一样脏，双腿间毛发茂盛，使她看起来像是布雷肯的妹妹。即便如此，她仍然有着吸引人的地方，塌鼻子、浓密的头发…和她穿上裙子之后微微屈膝行礼的样子。“您看见我的另一只鞋了吗，大人？”">查看中文翻译</div>

Between a duck pond and a blacksmith's forge, he came upon the tree that gave the place its name, an oak ancient and tall. Its gnarled roots twisted in and out of the earth like a nest of slow brown serpents, and hundreds of old copper pennies had been nailed to its huge trunk.</div>

They hid behind those walls when raiders came, that's why there's still a village here. And they are hiding there again, from me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="房屋里所有的火堆都被熄灭，但是有些还在冒烟，而且没有一堆是冷的。在哈利？梅利尔的仔细搜寻下，唯一能找到的活物就是一片菜地里的一只正在喂奶的山羊…但是这村子有一座防御工事，十二英寸高的厚石墙，不比河间地任何一座堡垒差，詹姆知道在那儿能找到村民们。当抢劫者到来时，他们就躲到城墙后面，这就是为什么这儿还能留有一个村子的原因。现在他们又藏到那里去了，为了躲避我。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Faces appeared on the wall above the gate. "They was king's men burned our village," one man called down. "Before that, some other king's men took our sheep. They were for a different king, but that didn't matter none to our sheep. King's men killed Harsley and Ser Ormond, and raped Lacey till she died."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“同时他们会向我们扔石头，并且弓箭会像羽毛一样插满我们全身。”詹姆摇了摇头。“这么做太血腥了。而且何必呢？这些人没伤害我们。我们就在房屋里休息，但是不要偷东西。我们有我们自己的储备。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As a half-moon crept up the sky, they staked their horses out in the village commons and supped on salted mutton, dried apples, and hard cheese. Jaime ate sparingly and shared a skin of wine with Peck and Hos the hostage. He tried to count the pennies nailed to the old oak, but there were too many of them and he kept losing count. What's that all about? The Blackwood boy would tell him if he asked, but that would spoil the mystery.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当半个月亮缓缓爬上天空的时候，他们把马都拴到了村里的空地上，用腌羊肉，干苹果和硬奶酪充当晚饭。詹姆略微吃了一点，并且和小派，霍斯分享了一袋酒。他试着去数老橡树上铜钱币的数量，但是太多了，他总是数到一半就忘了数字。这些铜钱币都代表了什么？如果他开口问，布莱克伍德男孩会告诉他答案，但是这会破坏了原本的神秘感。">查看中文翻译</div>
