<div class="line_en">It had been a poor season for tourists. Eugene found Dixieland almost deserted, save for a glum handful of regular or semi-regular guests. Mrs. Pert was there, sweet, gentle, a trifle more fuzzy than usual. Miss Newton, a wrenny and neurotic old maid, with asthma, who had gradually become Eliza's unofficial assistant in the management of the house, was there. Miss Malone, the gaunt drug-eater with the loose gray lips, was there. Fowler, a civil engineer with blond hair and a red face, who came and departed quietly, leaving a sodden stench of corn-whiskey in his wake, was there. Gant, who had now moved definitely from the house on Woodson Street, which he had rented, to a big back room at Eliza's, was there -- a little more waxen, a little more petulant, a little feebler than he had been before. And Ben was there.</div>

<div class="line_en">Eugene returned to Altamont two weeks before the term began at Pulpit Hill. The town and the nation seethed in the yeasty ferment of war. The country was turning into one huge camp. The colleges and universities were being converted into training-camps for officers. Every one was "doing his bit."</div>

<div class="line_en">During the brief two weeks that Eugene remained at home before departing again for Pulpit Hill, he shared with Ben a little room and sleeping-porch upstairs. And the quiet one talked -- talked himself from a low fierce mutter into a howling anathema of bitterness and hate that carried his voice, high and passionate, across all the sleeping world of night and rustling autumn.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在尤金即将返回讲坛山上学之前的短短两个星期里，他和本恩同住在楼上那间改成了卧房的凉台小隔间里。在这里，一向沉默寡言的本恩跟他聊个不停，他向尤金讲述自己的事情，声音总会从起初的低沉、暴躁的咕哝变成直着嗓门的大喊大叫，声音中饱含着痛苦和仇恨的诅咒，声音高亢、情绪激昂，响彻在寂静、秋叶沙沙的夜色里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He had been home for a week or two when Eugene arrived. He had been rejected again by both army and navy examining boards, he had been rejected as unfit in the draft; he had left his work suddenly in the tobacco town and come quietly and sullenly home. He was thinner and more like old ivory than ever. He prowled softly about the house, smoking innumerable cigarettes, cursing in brief snarling fury, touched with despair and futility. His old surly scowl was gone, his old angry mutter; his soft contemptuous laugh, touched with so much hidden tenderness, had given way to a contained but savage madness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="本恩在尤金回来的前一两个星期就已经回家了。他又去报名参军，但同样遭到了陆军和海军审查委员会的拒绝。征兵处的人以他的身体不大适合为由拒绝了他。他后来突然放弃了在烟草镇的差事，平静且满面阴沉地回到了家里。他比以前更加瘦削了，更像一尊古老的象牙雕刻。他在家里的时候，走路总会轻手轻脚，一根接一根地抽着香烟，而且还会狂怒地咆哮几声、咒骂几句，流露出绝望、自暴自弃的神情。他过去那种乖戾、怒气冲冲的神情，以及气乎乎的抱怨，现在不见了；他以往那种嘲弄而轻柔的笑声，以及蕴藏其间的温情不见了，取而代之的是随时可能爆发的野蛮和疯狂。">查看中文翻译</div>

Young men who were eighteen years old were being admitted into the officers' training corps. But he was not yet eighteen. His birthday was two weeks off. In vain he implored the tolerance of the examining board. What did two weeks matter? Could he get in as soon as his birthday arrived? They told him he could not. What, then, could he do?

Over the rim of the earth he heard the glorious stamp of the feet, the fierce sweet song of the horns. With a tender smile of love for his dear self, he saw himself wearing the eagles of a colonel on his gallant young shoulders. He saw himself as Ace Gant, the falcon of the skies, with 63 Huns to his credit by his nineteenth year. He saw himself walking up the Champs-Elysées, with a handsome powdering of gray hair above his temples, a left forearm of the finest cork, and the luscious young widow of a French marshal at his side. For the first time he saw the romantic charm of mutilation. The perfect and unblemished heroes of his childhood now seemed cheap to him -- fit only to illustrate advertisements for collars and toothpaste. He longed for that subtle distinction, that air of having lived and suffered that could only be attained by a wooden leg, a rebuilt nose, or the seared scar of a bullet across his temple.</div>

<div class="line_en">And he talked about his problem with the professors. Gravely, earnestly, he wrestled with his soul, mouthing with gusto the inspiring jargon of the crusade. For the present, said the professors, was his Place not Here? Did his Conscience tell him that he Had to go? If it did, they said gravely, they would say nothing more. But had he considered the Larger Issues?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他也跟大学的教授们讨论过自己遇到的难题。他一本正经地把自己内心深处的矛盾全部倾吐出来，跟着大家一起呼喊那些为了正义而战的口号。在这样的情况下，几位教授都会反问他，难道大学就不能成为他奋斗的阵地吗？他是不是受到“良心”驱使而觉得“非上前线不可”呢？他们同时还态度严肃地说，如果真是这样的话，他们也就无话可说了，但是他有没有考虑过更大的“责任”呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Meanwhile, he fed voraciously, and drank gallons of water in an effort to increase his poundage. He weighed himself a half-dozen times a day. He even made some effort at systematic exercise: swinging his arms, bending from his hips, and so on.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在他苦苦期待被召入伍的这段日子里，他拼命地进食，拼命地喝水，想使自己的体重能有所增加。他每天至少要称重五六次。他甚至努力进行一项系统的体操训练，包括甩手、弯腰等动作。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Is not," said the Acting Dean persuasively, "is not this your Sector? Is your own Front Line not here on the campus? Is it not here that you must Go Over The Top? Oh, I know," he went on with a smile of quiet pain, "I know it would be easier to go. I have had to fight that battle myself. But we are all part of the Army now; we are all enlisted in the Service of Liberty. We are all Mobilized for Truth. And each must Do His Bit where it will count for most."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="系主任好言相劝道：“难道，难道这里就不是你的‘阵地’吗？难道你自己的‘前线’就不能放在这个大学校园里吗？在这里不是同样可以‘奋勇杀敌’吗？哦，我明白了，”他苦笑一声继续说：“我明白了，打仗是容易实现目标的一种途径。我自己也有过这样的矛盾。但是我们现在已经全民皆兵了，我们全都是‘自由战士’了。为了‘真理’我们全部动员起来。我们每个人都必须把自己的绵薄之力贡献出来，只有这样才能形成强大的力量。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh, sir, it's hard!" cried Eugene passionately. "I tell you it's hard."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes, yes," said the Acting Dean gently, "for boys with a spirit like yours it's not easy."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不错，不错，”系主任态度温和地表示赞同，“一个孩子能有这样的精神境界，真是太不容易了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes," said Eugene, with a pale tortured face, "I know. I know it's wrong. But oh, sir -- when I think of those murderous beasts, when I think of how they have menaced All that we Hold Dear, when I think of Little Belgium, and then of My Own Mother, My Own Sister --" He turned away, clenching his hands, madly in love with himself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“说得对，”尤金面色苍白地回答，“我知道，我知道我的想法是错误的。但是，哦，不过老师——我一想到那帮凶残的杀人狂，一想到他们怎样威胁我们‘珍惜的东西’，一想到弱小的比利时受人欺侮，一想到自己的母亲和姐妹——”他转过脸，紧握拳头，沉浸在一种虚幻的英雄气概中。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Eugene was managing editor of the college paper. But, since the editor was enlisted in the corps, the entire work of publication fell to the boy. Every one was in the army. With the exception of a few dozen ratty Freshmen, a few cripples, and himself, every one, it seemed, was in the army. All of his fraternity brothers, all of his college mates, who had not previously enlisted, and many young men who had never before thought of college, were in the army. "Pap" Rheinhart, George Graves, Julius Arthur -- who had experienced brief and somewhat unfortunate careers at other universities, and a host of young Altamonters who had never known a campus before, were all enlisted now in the Student's Army.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尤金现开始担任校刊的责任编辑了。自从编辑应征军训以后，校刊出版方面的全部事务都落在了他的头上。除了几十个穿着破烂的新生、几个伤残人员和他自己以外，其余的人全都参军去了。他在兄弟会的所有会友、大学里刚开始没有应征入伍的同学，以及很多从来没有上过大学的年轻人，现在都已经入伍参军了。“阿伯”莱因哈特、乔治·葛雷夫、裘里斯·阿瑟等这些在其他大学读过一段时间书、但却早早退学的儿时伙伴们，以及一大帮从来不知道大学为何物的阿尔特蒙青年，现在都参加了“学生志愿军”。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He came and he went as he chose. When the barracks went dark at night, he prowled the campus, contemptuous of the electric flash and the muttered apologies of the officious shave-tails. He roomed in the village with a tall cadaver, a gaunt medical student with hollow cheeks and a pigeon-breast, named Heston. Three or four times a week he was driven over the rutted highway to Exeter where, in a little print shop, he drank the good warm smell of ink and steel.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他可以在校园里来去随意，享有自由的权利。晚上，待到整个军营熄灯以后，他仍然徘徊在校园里，四处采访新闻。军警打着手电筒照到他以后，又会连声道歉，而他却显得若无其事，轻蔑不理。他在校外的村镇上租了一间屋子，同屋是一位高个子、瘦得跟骷髅一样的医科学生，他的名字叫赫思顿。他每星期总有三四次，坐着车一路颠簸地去埃克西特镇的一家小印刷厂去，他在那里饱尝着油墨和印刷机器的味道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">During the first days, in the confusion of the new order, Eugene saw a great deal of them. Then, as the cogs of the machine began to grind more smoothly, and the university was converted into a big army post, with its punctual monotony of drilling, eating, studying, inspection, sleeping, he found himself detached, alone, occupying a position of unique and isolated authority.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="刚开始的一些日子，整个学校乱哄哄的，新的秩序还没有建立起来，尤金还能见到他们的影子。但是到后来，新秩序的齿轮渐渐磨合平稳以后，大学也变成了一个大型的军事基地，一天到晚准时重复着训练、吃饭、学习、检阅、睡觉这样的单调生活，他发现自己离群索居，拥有孤独、独特的权威。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He Carried On. He Held High the Torch. He Did His Bit. He was editor, reporter, censor, factotum of the paper. He wrote the news. He wrote the editorials. He seared them with flaming words. He extolled the crusade. He was possessed of the inspiration for murder.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他“不断努力前进”。他“高举正义的火炬”。他“贡献自己的绵薄之力”。他兼任校刊的编辑、记者、新闻审查员、打杂和跑腿各项事务。他撰写新闻和社论，用火一般的文字燃烧他的读者，他对美国参战的正义精神给予了高度赞扬。杀戮变成了鼓舞他精神的巨大动力。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Later, he prowled up the dreary main street of the town as the lights went up, ate at the Greek's, flirted with a few stray furtive women until the place went dead at ten o'clock, and came back through the dark countryside in a public-service car beside a drunken old walrus who drove like a demon, and whose name was "Soak" Young.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="稍晚一些，华灯初上，这时候他一个人悄悄地走上小镇的大街，在希腊人开的饭馆里吃晚饭，和几个不三不四的女人调一调情。等到10点钟餐馆打烊的时候，他又会搭上一辆公交车，穿过漆黑的田野赶回校内。他常坐在那个醉醺醺、绰号为“酒鬼”杨格的矮胖老司机身旁，车子一路横冲直撞，开得飞快。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">October began, and a season of small cold rain. The earth was a sodden reek of mud and rotten leaves. The trees dripped wearily and incessantly. His eighteenth birthday came, and he turned again, with a quivering tension, toward the war.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="10月初的时候，冷雨纷飞，满地都是散发着臭气的泥泞和腐败的落叶。树上的水珠一滴一滴、疲惫地向下滴落。他18岁的生日终于到来了，他的神经又一次紧张起来，注意力又转向了战争。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Daisy has been here with all her tribe. She went home two days ago, leaving Caroline and Richard. They have all been down sick with the flu. We've had a siege of it here. Every one has had it, and you never know who's going to be next. It seems to get the big strong ones first. Mr. Hanby, the Methodist minister, died last week. Pneumonia set in. He was a fine healthy man in the prime of life. The doctors said he was gone from the start. Helen has been laid up for several days. Says it's her old kidney trouble. They had McGuire in Thursday night. But they can't fool me, no matter what they say. Son, I hope you will never surrender to that awful craving. It has been the curse of my life. Your papa seems to go along about the same as usual. He eats well, and gets lots of sleep. I can't notice any change in him from a year ago. He may be here long after some of the rest of us are under the sod. Ben is still here. He mopes around the house all day and complains of having no appetite. I think he needs to get to work again doing something that will take his mind off himself. There are only a few people left in the house. Mrs. Pert and Miss Newton hang on as usual. The Crosbys have gone back to Miami. If it gets much colder here I'll just pack up and go too. I guess I must be getting old. I can't stand the cold the way I could when I was young. I want you to buy yourself a good warm overcoat before the winter sets in. You must also eat plenty of good substantial food. Don't squander your money but…"</div>
