<div class="line_en">Having packed up her luggage so that it could be sent to her later, she started in a hired trap for the little town of Stourcastle, through which it was necessary to pass on her journey, now in a direction almost opposite to that of her first adventuring. On the curve of the nearest hill she looked back regretfully at Marlott and her father's house, although she had been so anxious to get away.</div>

<div class="line_en">Her kindred dwelling there would probably continue their dally lives as heretofore, with no great diminution of pleasure in their consciousness, although she would be far off, and they deprived of her smile. In a few days the children would engage in their games as merrily as ever without the sense of any gap left by her departure. This leaving of the younger children she had decided to be for the best; were she to remain they would probably gain less good by her precepts than harm by her example.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在那所房屋里住着她的家人，尽管她就要远离他们，他们再也看不到她的笑容了，但是大概他们的日常生活也许会依然同过去一样，在他们的意识中快乐也不会有太多的减少。几天以后，孩子们就会像往常一样玩起他们的游戏来，不会感到因为她的离开而缺少了什么。她决心离开是为了这些更小的孩子们能得到更大的好处；如果她留在家里不走，他们也许从她的管教中得不到丝毫好处，反而会因她的榜样受害。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On a thyme-scented, bird-hatching morning in May, between two and three years after the return from Trantridge -- silent reconstructive years for Tess Durbeyfield -- she left her home for the second time.</div>

<div class="line_en">She went through Stourcastle without pausing, and onward to a junction of highways, where she could await a carrier's van that ran to the south-west; for the railways which engirdled this interior tract of country had never yet struck across it. While waiting, however, there came along a farmer in his spring-cart, driving approximately in the direction that she wished to pursue. Though he was a stranger to her she accepted his offer of a seat beside him, ignoring that its motive was a mere tribute to her countenance. He was going to Weatherbury, and by accompanying him thither she could walk the remainder of the distance instead of travelling in the van by way of Casterbridge.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她没有歇一歇就穿过斯图尔堡，向前一直走到几条大道的交叉路口，在那儿等候往西南去的搬运夫的大马车；因为铁路虽然包围了乡村内陆的广大区域，但是从来还没有穿过它的腹地。正当她在那儿等候马车的时候，路上有一个农夫坐着轻便的双轮马车走了过来，要去的地方大约同她要赶的路是一个方向。尽管她不认识这个陌生人，但还是接受了他的邀请，上车坐在农夫身边，而不管农夫邀请她的动机只是向她漂亮的脸蛋献上的一份殷勤。农夫是到韦瑟伯利去的，她坐车到了那儿，就不用再坐大马车绕道卡斯特桥，剩下的一段路靠步行就能走了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tess did not stop at Weatherbury, after this long drive, further than to make a slight nondescript meal at noon at a cottage to which the farmer recommended her. Thence she started on foot, basket in hand, to reach the wide upland of heath dividing this district from the low-lying meads of a further valley in which the dairy stood that was the aim and end of her day's pilgrimage.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="苔丝坐车走了长长的一段路，中午到了韦瑟伯利也没有停下来，只是到赶车的农夫推荐的一户农家稍微吃了一顿说不上名目的饭。接着她就提起篮子开始步行，向一片广袤的荒原高地走去。荒原把韦瑟伯利同远处低谷的一片草场分隔开来，而坐落在山谷中的奶牛场才是她当日行程的目的地，也是她当日行程的终点。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Tess had never before visited this part of the country, and yet she felt akin to the landscape. Not so very far to the left of her she could discern a dark patch in the scenery, which inquiry confirmed her in supposing to be trees marking the environs of Kingsbere -- in the church of which parish the bones of her ancestors -- her useless ancestors -- lay entombed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="苔丝以前从来没有到过乡间这块地方，不过她却感到同这儿的风景有着血亲关系。就在她左边不很远的地方，她看见风景中有一块深色的地方，一问别人，证明她的猜想果然不错，那是把金斯伯尔的近郊区别开来的树林——就在那个教区的教堂里，埋葬着她的祖先——她的那些毫无用处的祖先的枯骨。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She had no admiration for them now; she almost hated them for the dance they had led her; not a thing of all that had been theirs did she retain but the old seal and spoon. 'Pooh -- I have as much of mother as father in me!' she said. 'All my prettiness comes from her, and she was only a dairymaid.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在她对他们毫无敬仰的心情了；甚至她还恨他们给她带来烦恼；他们除了给她留下来一方古印和一把羹匙而外，其它的东西一件也没有给她留下来。“呸——我本来就是我的父母两个人养的！”她说。“我的全部美貌也是我妈给的，而她只不过是一个挤牛奶的女工。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The journey over the intervening uplands and lowlands of Egdon, when she reached them, was a more troublesome walk than she had anticipated, the distance being actually but a few miles. It was two hours, owing to sundry wrong turnings, ere she found herself on a summit commanding the long-sought-for vale, the Valley of the Great Dairies, the valley in which milk and butter grew to rankness, and were produced more profusely, if less delicately, than at her home -- the verdant plain so well watered by the river Var or Froom.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她走完从爱敦荒原上的高地和低地中间穿过的路程，这段距离实际上只不过几英里远，但比她所期望的要难走得多。由于拐弯时多走了一些冤枉路，她走了两个小时才走到一个山顶上，望见她渴望已久的沟谷：大奶牛场的沟谷。在那个沟谷里，牛奶和黄油的增长十分迅速，虽然不如她家里的牛奶和黄油味美，但它们的生产要远比瓦尔河或佛卢姆河所灌溉的那块翠绿草原上生产的牛奶和黄油丰富。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was intrinsically different from the Vale of Little Dairies, Blackmoor Vale, which, save during her disastrous sojourn at Trantridge, she had exclusively known till now. The world was drawn to a larger pattern here. The enclosures numbered fifty acres instead of ten, the farmsteads were more extended, the groups of cattle formed tribes hereabout; there only families. These myriads of cows stretching under her eyes from the far east to the far west outnumbered any she had ever seen at one glance before. The green lea was speckled as thickly with them as a canvas by Van Alsloot or Sallaert with burghers. The ripe hues of the red and dun kine absorbed the evening sunlight, which the white-coated animals returned to the eye in rays almost dazzling, even at the distant elevation on which she stood.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她除了在特兰里奇住了一段不幸的日子外，到现在她所知道的地方只是布莱克莫尔谷的小奶牛场谷，而大奶牛场谷同它则根本不同。世界在这儿是按照更大的模式描绘的。圈起来的牧场不是十亩地，而是五十亩地，农场也更加广大，牛群在这儿组成的是一个个部落，而在那儿只是一个个家庭。放眼望去，无数的奶牛从远远的东边一直延伸到远远的西边，在数目上超过了她以前看见过的任何牛群。它们散布在绿色的草地上，挤“得密密麻麻的，就像凡·阿尔斯卢特或萨雷尔特在画布上画满了市民一样。红色和暗褐色母牛身上的成熟颜色，和傍晚落日的霞光融合在一起，而全身白色的奶牛把光线反射出去，几乎使人为之目炫，甚至苔丝站在远处的高地上也是如此。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The bird's-eye perspective before her was not so luxuriantly beautiful, perhaps, as that other one which she knew so well; yet it was more cheering. It lacked the intensely blue atmosphere of the rival vale, and its heavy soils and scents; the new air was clear, bracing, ethereal. The river itself, which nourished the grass and cows of these renowned dairies, flowed not like the streams in Blackmoor. Those were slow, silent, often turbid; flowing over beds of mud into which the incautious wader might sink and vanish unawares. The Froom waters were clear as the pure River of Life shown to the Evangelist, rapid as the shadow of a cloud, with pebbly shallows that prattled to the sky all day long. There the water-flower was the lily; the crowfoot here.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="俯瞰呈现在她面前的那片风景，虽然不如她无比熟悉的另一片风景绚烂华美，但它却更能使人欢快振奋。它缺少那个能和它媲美的沟谷所有的强烈的蓝色气氛，缺少它厚实的土壤和浓烈的香气；它的新鲜空气清新、凉爽、灵妙。滋养牧草和这些著名奶牛场里的奶牛的那条河流，也同布莱克莫尔的河流流动得不一样。布莱克莫尔的河流流得缓慢、沉静、常常是浑浊的；它们从积满泥淖的河床上流过去，不明情形而涉水过河的人，稍不注意就会陷进泥淖里。佛卢姆河的流水却是清澈的，就像那位福音教徒看见的那条生命河一样纯净，流得也快，就像一片浮云的阴影，流过铺满卵石的浅滩，还整天对着天空喃喃絮语。那儿水中长的是睡莲，这儿水里长的却是毛茛。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Either the change in the quality of the air from heavy to light, or the sense of being amid new scenes where there were no invidious eyes upon her, sent up her spirits wonderfully. Her hopes mingled with the sunshine in an ideal photosphere which surrounded her as she bounded along against the soft south wind. She heard a pleasant voice in every breeze, and in every bird's note seemed to lurk a joy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="也许是空气的性质从沉闷到轻松的变化，也许是她觉得已经到了没有人用恶意的眼光看待她的新地方，于是她的精神奇妙地振作起来。迎着温柔的南风，她一路跳跃着向前走去，她的希望同阳光融合在一起，似乎幻化成了一道环绕着她的光环。在吹来的阵阵微风中，她听得出快乐的声音，在一声声鸟的啼鸣里，也似乎潜藏着欢愉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Her face had latterly changed with changing states of mind, continually fluctuating between beauty and ordinariness, according as the thoughts were gay or grave. One day she was pink and flawless; another pale and tragical. When she was pink she was feeling less than when pale; her more perfect beauty accorded with her less elevated mood; her more intense mood with her less perfect beauty. It was her best face physically that was now set against the south wind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她的面貌，近来随着她的心境的变化而发生了变化，由于她的心绪有时快乐，有时沉郁，因而她的面貌也在美丽和平常之间变幻不定。今天她的脸色红润、完美；明天就转为苍白、凄楚。当她的脸色变得红润时，她就不像脸色苍白时那样一脸的忧愁；她的更加完美的美丽同她的平静的心情显得和谐；她的紧张的心情也同她的不太完美的美丽显得般配。现在她迎向南风的脸，正是在形体上显得最美的脸。">查看中文翻译</div>
