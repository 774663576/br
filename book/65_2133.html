<div class="line_en">Of course Baby didn't understand, but she stopped and didn't move. I was listening for water -- a river or anything. I couldn't hear water, just the wind in the trees and a wolf singing to the moon.</div>

<div class="line_en">The moon went behind clouds and we swam in the dark. I was happy about that because I was afraid the wolves would see us. When my feet hit stones underneath me, I knew the water wasn't deep any more. I stood up. A minute later Baby was walking too. We walked out of the water. My legs couldn't hold me up. I half fell and lay on the ground and felt very happy. Baby lay beside me, wet but warm. I slept for a little while.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="月亮隐入云朵背后，我们在黑暗中继续往前游。这让我觉得欣慰，因为我怕狼群会看到我们。我的脚碰到了身下的石头时，我知道水已经没那么深了。我站了起来。很快鹿宝宝也走起来了。我们走出湖面。我的双腿已经撑不住了。我倒下躺在地上，心里非常快慰。潮湿而温暖的鹿宝宝靠着我卧下，我睡了一小会儿。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I saw light through the trees. I hurried and Baby came after me. Soon we came to open ground, and there it was -- moonlight on water! Not a river, but a big lake.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我看到有光线穿透树林。我加快速度，鹿宝宝紧紧地跟着。很快我们到了空地，就是这儿——月光倒映在水面上！不是河，而是一个大湖。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">How far was it to the other side? I don't know, but it took us a long, long time. It was more difficult for me than Baby in the end. I'm a walking, climbing animal; deer are running, jumping, swimming animals. My arms and legs hurt, my body felt heavy and I swam more and more slowly. But Baby was always there beside me, touching me all the time, her legs moving quickly in the water. She was warm, while I was cold, and that helped me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到对岸有多远？我不知道，但这花了我们很长很长时间。最后我反而比鹿宝宝更觉困难。我是擅长行走和攀缘的动物，而鹿则擅长奔跑、跳跃和游泳。我的胳膊和腿脚很疼，身体发沉，游得越来越慢。但是鹿宝宝一直在我旁边，不停地碰碰我，它的腿在水里飞快划动。我有些冷，但是鹿宝宝的身体很暖和，让我好受了许多。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's a long swim, Baby," I told her, "but if we stay here, we'll die."</div>

<div class="line_en">I've just woken up. We have to begin moving soon. It's still night, but we must be far away from here by morning. Some of the ground is soft. Soft ground is dangerous because the wolves can see where we have gone. We must go on the hard, stony places.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我刚醒过来，我们马上又要开始赶路。夜晚还没有过去，但是在早上之前，我们必须要远离这里。这儿有的地面很软，松软的地面很危险，因为狼群会看到我们曾从哪儿经过。我们得在坚硬的石头地上行进。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When the deer family left us three days ago, I saw some hills to the north. Father always hides in the trees when there's danger, and up there on the hills there are a lot of big, dark trees. Just right for Father.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="三天前，当鹿群离开我们的时候，我看到北面有一些小山。有危险时鹿爸爸总是躲进树林；而那边山上有很多高高大大、黑黝黝的树木，对鹿爸爸正合适。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Baby went in a funny, jumping run up to Mother. She kept one foot off the ground; it was still hurting. Mother and Baby touched heads and made noises. Father came and smelt me while Brother watched. Father doesn't usually get too near anyone in the family, but he stood nearly touching me. I think he was saying thank you, and my eyes were wet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="鹿宝宝滑稽地跳到鹿妈妈身边，一只脚没有着地，那儿还疼呢。鹿妈妈和鹿宝宝碰碰头，发出声响。鹿爸爸走过来闻闻我，鹿哥哥在一边看着。鹿爸爸一般不和家里人走得太近，但是它这时挨着我站着。我想它是在说谢谢，我的眼睛湿润了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你到那儿去。”我对鹿爸爸说，“到树林里去，我去另一边的空地。狼群会跟着我的血来找我。如果狼群没有追到我，我会等上几天，然后再来找你们。明白吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
