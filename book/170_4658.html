<div class="line_en">Today she counted five-and-twenty, though some were far away and moving, so it was hard to be certain. Sometimes she missed one, or counted one twice. What does it matter? A strangler only needs ten fingers. All trade had stopped, and her fisherfolk did not dare put out into the bay. The boldest still dropped a few lines into the river, though even that was hazardous; more remained tied up beneath Meereen's walls of many-colored brick.</div>

<div class="line_en">"If there is a Harpy." Skahaz was convinced that somewhere in Meereen the Sons of the Harpy had a highborn overlord, a secret general commanding an army of shadows. Dany did not share his belief. The Brazen Beasts had taken dozens of the Harpy's Sons, and those who had survived their capture had yielded names when questioned sharply… too many names, it seemed to her. It would have been pleasant to think that all the deaths were the work of a single enemy who might be caught and killed, but Dany suspected that the truth was otherwise. My enemies are legion. "Hizdahr zo Loraq is a persuasive man with many friends. And he is wealthy. Perhaps he has bought this peace for us with gold, or convinced the other highborn that our marriage is in their best interests."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“如果有一个鹰身女妖。”斯卡哈兹确信，在弥林的某个地方，鹰身女妖之子们有一个出身高贵的大头目，一个秘密的指挥影子部队的司令官。丹妮不相信他的说法。铜面兽抓住了数十个鹰身女妖之子，那些活下来的俘虏面对严厉的质问时，供认出一些名字…太多的名字，似乎在她看来。所有的死亡都是一个敌人的杰作，而这个敌人将会被抓住杀死，如果是这样那真是太令人愉快了。但是，丹妮怀疑事实正好相反，我的敌人众多。“希兹达尔？佐？洛拉克是个有着很多朋友又会说服别人的人，而且他还很富有，或许是他用金币为我们买来这种和平，或者是说服其他贵族相信：我们的婚姻是最符合他们利益的事情。”">查看中文翻译</div>

If there is to be a battle, the blood of my blood should be with me. She missed Ser Jorah Mormont too. He lied to me, informed on me, but he loved me too, and he always gave good counsel.
