<div class="line_en">"Quiet," the wench grumbled, scowling. Scowls suited her broad homely face better than a smile. Not that Jaime had ever seen her smiling. He amused himself by picturing her in one of Cersei's silken gowns in place of her studded leather jerkin. As well dress a cow in silk as this one.</div>

<div class="line_en">An east wind blew through his tangled hair, as soft and fragrant as Cersei's fingers. He could hear birds singing, and feel the river moving beneath the boat as the sweep of the oars sent them toward the pale pink dawn. After so long in darkness, the world was so sweet that Jaime Lannister felt dizzy. I am alive, and drunk on sunlight. A laugh burst from his lips, sudden as a quail flushed from cover.</div>

<div class="line_en">But the cow could row. Beneath her roughspun brown breeches were calves like cords of wood, and the long muscles of her arms stretched and tightened with each stroke of the oars. Even after rowing half the night, she showed no signs of tiring, which was more than could be said for his cousin Ser Cleos, laboring on the other oar. A big strong peasant wench to look at her, yet she speaks like one highborn and wears longsword and dagger. Ah, but can she use them? Jaime meant to find out, as soon as he rid himself of these fetters.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但这头母牛会划船。粗糙的棕色马裤下，她确有牛一般的腿，硬木一样粗，而手臂上长长的肌键随着每次击浆而伸缩。即使划了大半夜，她也没有疲劳的迹象，划另一支桨的表弟克里奥爵士可差远了。她看起来真像个高大强壮的乡下妞儿，口气却又透出高贵，身上带着长剑和匕首。噢，她会用吗？詹姆想试试，一旦摆脱镣铐马上就试。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He wore iron manacles on his wrists and a matching pair about his ankles, joined by a length of heavy chain no more than a foot long. "You'd think my word as a Lannister was not good enough," he'd japed as they bound him. He'd been very drunk by then, thanks to Catelyn Stark. Of their escape from Riverrun, he recalled only bits and pieces. There had been some trouble with the gaoler, but the big wench had overcome him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他手戴铁铐，脚上也有，脚踝间连着的沉重铁环还不到一尺。“我以身为兰尼斯特的荣誉发誓还不够？”他们绑他时，他咯咯笑道。凯特琳·史塔克将他灌得酩酊大醉，对逃出奔流城的过程，詹姆一片模糊。似乎狱卒找了些麻烦，但这强壮妞儿几下便将其制服。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After that they had climbed an endless stair, around and around. His legs were weak as grass, and he'd stumbled twice or thrice, until the wench lent him an arm to lean on. At some point he was bundled into a traveler's cloak and shoved into the bottom of a skiff. He remembered listening to Lady Catelyn command someone to raise the portcullis on the Water Gate. She was sending Ser Cleos Frey back to King's Landing with new terms for the queen, she'd declared in a tone that brooked no argument.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="随后穿越无穷无尽的楼梯，转来转去，他的腿软得象草，三两次绊倒在地，最终被妞儿架着走。走到某处，他们将他裹进一件行者斗篷，猛推入小船底。他记得听到凯特琳夫人令人打开水门的吊闸，随后一字一句、用不容争议的语调将新条件复述给克里奥爵士，要他带回君临禀报。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He must have drifted off then. The wine had made him sleepy, and it felt good to stretch, a luxury his chains had not permitted him in the cell. Jaime had long ago learned to snatch sleep in the saddle during a march. This was no harder. Tyrion is going to laugh himself sick when he hears how I slept through my own escape. He was awake now, though, and the fetters were irksome. "My lady," he called out, "if you'll strike off these chains, I'll spell you at those oars."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着便是乘船。虽然药酒让他昏昏沉沉，但心情不错，舒展身体的感觉…在黑牢里时受制于铁链，是得不到这种享受的。很久以来，詹姆已习惯了行军途中于马上小寐，并不难。提利昂知道我逃亡途中竟睡过去的一定会笑得前仰后合。醒醒吧，铁镣声还真让人厌烦。“小姐，”他喊，“行行好，把这些铁玩意儿砸开，咱们轮着划如何？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Lannister blood runs thin in this one. Cleos was his Aunt Genna's son by that dullard Emmon Frey, who had lived in terror of Lord Tywin Lannister since the day he wed his sister. When Lord Walder Frey had brought the Twins into the war on the side of Riverrun, Ser Emmon had chosen his wife's allegiance over his father's. Casterly Rock got the worst of that bargain, Jaime reflected. Ser Cleos looked like a weasel, fought like a goose, and had the courage of an especially brave ewe. Lady Stark had promised him release if he delivered her message to Tyrion, and Ser Cleos had solemnly vowed to do so.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这家伙身上兰尼斯特的血液相当稀薄。克里奥是吉娜姑妈和那愚钝的艾蒙·佛雷的长子，那呆子自打和泰温·兰尼斯特公爵的妹妹结婚起就生活在对泰温大人的恐惧中…当初瓦德·佛雷侯爵率孪河城加入奔流城一方时，艾蒙爵士吓得只敢站在妻子这边。凯岩城多了个帮倒忙的蠢猪。克里奥爵士模样像头鼬，打起来像只鹅，勇气相当于比较勇敢的绵羊。凯特琳夫人答应把信带给提利昂就释放他，克里奥爵士便庄严起誓。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I wonder what the High Septon would have to say about the sanctity of oaths sworn while dead drunk, chained to a wall, with a sword pressed to your chest? Not that Jaime was truly concerned about that fat fraud, or the gods he claimed to serve. He remembered the pail Lady Catelyn had kicked over in his cell. A strange woman, to trust her girls to a man with shit for honor. Though she was trusting him as little as she dared. She is putting her hope in Tyrion, not in me. "Perhaps she is not so stupid after all," he said aloud.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="总主教该如何评价一个喝得烂醉、被绑在墙上、用长剑指着胸膛的人所发下的誓言呢？詹姆并不真正关心那肥胖的骗子，或他所宣称服务的神灵，他想到的是凯特琳夫人在黑牢里踢翻的那个桶。奇怪的女人，肯将女儿的性命信托给把荣誉当狗屎的我？当然啦，其实她的希望是寄托在提利昂身上。“也许，说到底她不苯，”他大声道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They'd all done a deal of vowing back in that cell, Jaime most of all. That was Lady Catelyn's price for loosing him. She had laid the point of the big wench's sword against his heart and said, "Swear that you will never again take up arms against Stark nor Tully. Swear that you will compel your brother to honor his pledge to return my daughters safe and unharmed. Swear on your honor as a knight, on your honor as a Lannister, on your honor as a Sworn Brother of the Kingsguard. Swear it by your sister's life, and your father's, and your son's, by the old gods and the new, and I'll send you back to your sister. Refuse, and I will have your blood." He remembered the prick of the steel through his rags as she twisted the point of the sword.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="其实在黑牢里，他们都发了一堆誓，詹姆发的最多，这是凯特琳夫人为释放他们而索取的代价。她用那大块头妞儿的剑指着他的心窝：“发誓，你再不会拿起武器反对史塔克家族或徒利家族；发誓，你会迫使你弟弟兑现诺言，平安无恙地释放我的女儿们。以你身为骑士的荣誉，以你身为兰尼斯特的荣誉，以你身为御林铁卫的荣誉起誓。以你姐姐、你父亲、你儿子的性命，向新旧诸神起誓，然后我放你回你姐姐身边去。若不答应，休怪我白刀子进，红刀子出。”她转动长剑，锋利的尖头穿透褴褛衣衫，刺痛感至今记忆犹新。">查看中文翻译</div>

Their journey north had been one long torment; seeing her every day, unable to touch her, knowing that Robert stumbled drunkenly into her bed every night in that great creaking wheelhouse.

<div class="line_en">Downriver, the rising sun shimmered against the wind-whipped surface of the river. The south shore was red clay, smooth as any road. Smaller streams fed into the greater, and the rotting trunks of drowned trees clung to the banks. The north shore was wilder. High rocky bluffs rose twenty feet above them, crowned by stands of beech, oak, and chestnut. Jaime spied a watchtower on the heights ahead, growing taller with every stroke of the oars.

Tully trout, there's a bad omen, he thought, until he saw a worse -- one of the floating logs they passed turned out to be a dead man, bloodless and swollen.

<div class="line_en">The forks of the Trident were the easiest way to move goods or men across the riverlands. In times of peace, they would have encountered fisherfolk in their skiffs, grain barges being poled downstream, merchants selling needles and bolts of cloth from floating shops, perhaps even a gaily painted mummer's boat with quilted sails of half a hundred colors, making its way upriver from village to village and castle to castle.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Red Fork was wide and slow, a meandering river of loops and bends dotted with tiny wooded islets and frequently choked by sandbars and snags that lurked just below the water's surface. Brienne seemed to have a keen eye for the dangers, though, and always seemed to find the channel. When Jaime complimented her on her knowledge of the river, she looked at him suspiciously and said, "I do not know the river. Tarth is an island.

They crossed the head of the island and turned sharply down the cutoff, sending a wash of water against the face of the bluff as the boat tilted. The island was densely wooded, a tangle of willows, oaks, and tall pines that cast deep shadows across the rushing water, hiding snags and the rotted trunks of drowned trees. To their left the bluff rose sheer and rocky, and at its foot the river foamed whitely around broken boulders and tumbles of rock fallen from the cliff face.</div>

<div class="line_en">They could see the sail moving behind the trees. The river galley came into full view at the top of the cutoff, twenty-five yards behind. Her bow swung hard as she came around, and a half-dozen arrows took flight, but all went well wide. The motion of the two boats was giving the archers difficulty, but Jaime knew they'd soon enough learn to compensate. Brienne was halfway up the cliff face, pulling herself from handhold to handhold. Ryger's sure to see her, and once he does he'll have those bowmen bring her down. Jaime decided to see if the old man's pride would make him stupid.

<div class="line_en">The range was less than twenty yards. The archers could scarcely have missed, but as they pulled on their longbows a rain of pebbles cascaded down around them. Small stones rattled on their deck, bounced off their helms, and made splashes on both sides of the bow. Those who had wits enough to understand raised their eyes just as a boulder the size of a cow detached itself from the top of the bluff. Ser Robin shouted in dismay. The stone tumbled through the air, struck the face of the cliff, cracked in two, and smashed down on them. The larger piece snapped the mast, tore through the sail, sent two of the archers flying into the river, and crushed the leg of a rower as he bent over his oar. The rapidity with which the galley began to fill with water suggested that the smaller fragment had punched right through her hull. The oarsman's screams echoed off the bluff while the archers flailed wildly in the current. From the way they were splashing, neither man could swim. Jaime laughed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="距离不满二十码。弓箭手不会失手，不过当他们拉开长弓时，一阵鹅卵石的瀑布落在周围。小石块砸在甲板和舵上，弹入水中。懂得抬头的聪明人发现一块母牛般大的巨石从悬崖顶落了下来。罗宾爵士惊惶地呼喊。岩石坠入空中，撞上岩壁，裂成两半，猛冲而下。大的那块折断船桅，撕裂风帆，把两个弓箭手抛入水中，压碎了那些收起桨的桨手们的大腿。战船迅速进水，看来小的那块穿透了船体。岩壁反射着桨手们的惨叫，而弓箭手们在水流中狂乱地击打。依姿势看，没一个会游泳。詹姆笑了。">查看中文翻译</div>

When Jaime looked up, Brienne was lumbering along the clifftop, well ahead of them, having cut across a finger of land while they were following the bend in the river. She threw herself off the rock, and looked almost graceful as she folded into a dive. It would have been ungracious to hope that she would smash her head on a stone. Ser Cleos turned the skiff toward her. Thankfully, Jaime still had his oar. One good swing when she comes paddling up and I'll be free of her.</div>
