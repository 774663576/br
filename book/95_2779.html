<div class="line_en">Teddy's mom worked as a domestic for a family in Linksfield, a wealthy suburb near school. Linksfield was a long walk from my house, nearly forty minutes, but still doable. Walking around was pretty much all I did back then, anyway. I couldn't afford to do anything else, and I couldn't afford to get around any other way. If you liked walking, you were my friend. Teddy and I walked all over Johannesburg together. I'd walk to Teddy's house and we'd hang out there. Then we'd walk back to my house and hang out there. We'd walk from my house down to the city center, which was like a three-hour hike, just to hang out, and then we'd walk all the way back.</div>

<div class="line_en">At Sandringham I got to know this one kid, Teddy. Funny guy, charming as hell. My mom used to call him Bugs Bunny; he had a cheeky smile with two big teeth that stuck out the front of his mouth. Teddy and I got along like a house on fire, one of those friends where you start hanging out and from that day forward you're never apart. We were both naughty as shit, too. With Teddy, I'd finally met someone who made me feel normal. I was the terror in my family. He was the terror in his family. When you put us together it was mayhem. Walking home from school we'd throw rocks through windows, just to see them shatter, and then we'd run away. We got detention together all the time. The teachers, the pupils, the principal, everyone at school knew: Teddy and Trevor, thick as thieves.</div>

<div class="line_en">One night we were at the mall and most of the shops were closed, but the cinema was still showing movies so the building was still open. There was this stationery shop that sold greeting cards and magazines, and it didn't have a door, so when it closed at night there was only a metal gate, like a trellis, that was pulled across the entrance and padlocked. Walking past this shop, Teddy and I realized that if we put our arms through the trellis we could reach this rack of chocolates just inside. And these weren't just any chocolates -- they were alcohol-filled chocolates. I loved alcohol. Loved loved loved it. My whole life I'd steal sips of grown-ups' drinks whenever I could.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有天晚上我们在商场里玩，那时大多数商铺已经关门了，但由于电影院还有放映，所以整栋楼还开着。那里有个卖贺卡和杂志的文具店，没有门，只有一道类似于网格的铁栅栏，晚上关店的时候，在入口拉开栅栏，挂上锁，就算关了门。泰迪和我路过这家店的时候意识到，我们把胳膊伸进这道铁栅栏，刚刚好碰到摆有巧克力的那排架子。而且，这不是普普通通的巧克力——这是酒心巧克力。我喜欢酒。超级超级喜欢。我长这么大，只要有机会，就想偷喝一口大人的酒。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Friday and Saturday nights we'd walk to the mall and hang out. The Balfour Park Shopping Mall was a few blocks from my house. It's not a big mall, but it has everything -- an arcade, a cinema, restaurants, South Africa's version of Target, South Africa's version of the Gap. Then, once we were at the mall, since we never had any money to shop or watch movies or buy food, we'd just wander around inside.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="周五和周六的晚上，我们会走到商场去玩。巴尔弗公园商场离我家就只有几个街区，不是个大商场，但什么都有——游戏厅、电影院、餐厅，有南非版的塔吉特百货，还有南非版的盖璞。我们其实没有钱买东西、看电影或吃东西，所以只能在商场里瞎转悠。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We reached in, grabbed a few, drank the liquor inside, and then gobbled down the chocolates. We'd hit the jackpot. We started going back again and again to steal more. We'd wait for the shops to start to close, then we'd go and sit against the gate, acting like we were just hanging out. We'd check to make sure the coast was clear, and then one of us would reach in, grab a chocolate, and drink the whiskey. Reach in, grab a chocolate, drink the rum. Reach in, grab a chocolate, drink the brandy. We did this every weekend for at least a month, having the best time. Then we pushed our luck too far.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们把胳膊伸进去，拿了几块巧克力，喝掉了里面的酒，又狼吞虎咽地吃掉了巧克力。我们简直像中了大奖，于是开始反复回到那边，试图偷更多的巧克力。我们会等着商铺快要关门的时候过去，坐在铁门边，假装在玩。然后确保四周没人后，我们轮流伸手进去，拿一块巧克力，喝掉里面的威士忌。伸手进去，拿一块巧克力，喝掉里面的朗姆酒。伸手进去，拿一块巧克力，喝掉里面的白兰地。我们每周末都要做这件事，持续了至少一个月，开心得不得了。我们太得寸进尺了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was a Saturday night. We were hanging out at the entrance to the stationery shop, leaning up against the gate. I reached in to grab a chocolate, and at that exact moment a mall cop came around the corner and saw me with my arm in up to my shoulder. I brought my hand out with a bunch of chocolates in it. It was almost like a movie. I saw him. He saw me. His eyes went wide. I tried to walk away, acting natural. Then he shouted out, "Hey! Stop!"</div>

<div class="line_en">We ran straight across the parking lot, ducking and weaving between parked cars, the guards right behind us, yelling. We made it to the petrol station out at the road, ran through there, and hooked left up the main road. They chased and chased and we ran and ran, and it was awesome. The risk of getting caught was half the fun of being naughty, and now the chase was on. I was loving it. I was shitting myself, but also loving it. This was my turf. This was my neighborhood. You couldn't catch me in my neighborhood. I knew every alley and every street, every back wall to climb over, every fence with a gap big enough to slip through. I knew every shortcut you could possibly imagine. As a kid, wherever I went, whatever building I was in, I was always plotting my escape. You know, in case shit went down. In reality I was a nerdy kid with almost no friends, but in my mind I was an important and dangerous man who needed to know where every camera was and where all the exit points were.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们直冲冲地跑过停车场，在停着的车之间左闪右避，保安则在我们身后大声吼着，紧追不舍。我们跑到了路边的加油站，直接穿了过去，左拐上了主路。他们追啊追，我们跑啊跑，太爽了。本来干坏事的快感里有一半就是来自可能被抓到的风险，现在还加上了追捕的戏份。我太兴奋了，尽管都吓得快拉裤子了，但我就是喜欢这种感觉。这是我的地盘。这是我住的地方。你不可能在我的地盘上抓住我。我清楚每一个小巷，每一条街道，每一道可以翻越的后墙，每一扇有着足够大空隙、可以让我侧身钻过去的栅栏。我知道所有你能想象到的近路。作为一个小孩，无论我去哪儿，无论在哪栋楼，我都在琢磨可能的逃跑路线。你懂的，以防我们犯了什么事儿，需要逃跑。在现实生活中，我是个木讷的小孩，几乎没有朋友，但是在我的头脑中，我是个重要且危险的角色，而这个角色需要了解每一个摄像头的朝向，以及每一个紧急出口的位置。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And the chase was on. We bolted, heading for the doors. I knew if a guard cut us off at the exit we'd be trapped, so we were hauling ass as fast as we could. We cleared the exit. The second we hit the parking lot, mall cops were coming at us from every direction, a dozen of them at least. I was running with my head down. These guards knew me. I was in that mall all the time. The guards knew my mom, too. She did her banking at that mall. If they even caught a glimpse of who I was, I was dead.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="追捕开始了。我们像箭一样冲向大门。我心里明白，如果有保安在出口堵我们，我们就逃不掉了，所以我们得尽快开溜。我们顺利跑出了大门，但是刚进到停车场，商场保安们就从各个方向向我们涌来，至少有十几个人。我跑的时候把头使劲低着。这些保安都认识我，因为我总在这个商场玩。他们也认识我妈，因为她常来这个商场里的银行办事。如果他们有一瞬间瞄到了我是谁，我就完了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I knew we couldn't run forever. We needed a plan. As Teddy and I booked past the fire station there was a road off to the left, a dead end that ran into a metal fence. I knew that there was a hole in the fence to squeeze through and on the far side was an empty field behind the mall that took you back to the main road and back to my house. A grown-up couldn't fit through the hole, but a kid could. All my years of imagining the life of a secret agent for myself finally paid off. Now that I needed an escape, I had one.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我知道我们不能一直这样跑下去。我们需要计划。泰迪和我冲过消防站之后，那里会有一条路通向左边的死胡同，死胡同尽头是一道铁栅栏。我知道栅栏上有个洞，挤过去之后，就能来到商场后面的空地，从那儿我们可以返回主路，再回到我家。成年人是没法从那个洞里穿过去的，但小孩可以。这么多年以来，我脑中盘算的秘密特务白日梦总算是要付诸实践了。现在我需要逃出生天，机会来了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He didn't. I turned and ran into the dead end. Teddy broke the other way. Half the mall cops followed him, half followed me. I got to the fence and knew exactly how to squirm through. Head, then shoulder, one leg, then twist, then the other leg -- done. I was through. The guards hit the fence behind me and couldn't follow. I ran across the field to a fence on the far side, popped through there, and then I was right on the road, three blocks from my house. I slipped my hands into my pockets and casually walked home, another harmless pedestrian out for a stroll.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他没有跟来。我左转跑进了死胡同，泰迪去了另一条路。一半的商场保安去追他，另一半来追我。我跑到了铁栅栏前，早就想好了怎样侧着身子蹭过去。头先过，再过肩膀，再伸一条腿，转身，另一条腿也过来了——大功告成。我过去了。那些保安被我身后的铁栅栏拦住，无法再追上我。我跑着穿过空地，另一头也有一道栅栏，我也轻松穿过了，然后我回到了主路上。这里离我家只有三个街区，我把手插在裤兜里，平静地走回了家，看起来就像是某个出来散步的普通路人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I looked at the screen and I realized: Teddy was dark. I am light; I have olive skin. But the camera can't expose for light and dark at the same time. So when you put me on a black-and-white screen next to a black person, the camera doesn't know what to do. If the camera has to pick, it picks me as white. My color gets blown out. In this video, there was a black person and a white person. But still: It was me. The picture wasn't great, and my facial features were a bit blurry, but if you looked closely: It was me. I was Teddy's best friend. I was Teddy's only friend. I was the single most likely accomplice. You had to at least suspect that it was me. They didn't. They grilled me for a good ten minutes, but only because they were so sure that I had to know who this white kid was.</div>

<div class="line_en">South Africa has eleven official languages. After democracy came, people said, "Okay, how do we create order without having different groups feel like they've been left out of power again?" English is the international language and the language of money and of the media, so we had to keep that. Most people were forced to learn at least some Afrikaans, so it's useful to keep that, too. Plus we didn't want the white minority to feel ostracized in the new South Africa, or else they'd take all their money and leave.</div>

<div class="line_en">It's the Tower of Babel in South Africa. Every single day. Every day you see people completely lost, trying to have conversations and having no idea what the other person is saying. Zulu and Tswana are fairly common. Tsonga and Pedi are pretty fringe. The more common your tongue, the less likely you are to learn others. The more fringe, the more likely you are to pick up two or three. In the cities most people speak at least some English and usually a bit of Afrikaans, enough to get around. You'll be at a party with a dozen people where bits of conversation are flying by in two or three different languages. You'll miss part of it, someone might translate on the fly to give you the gist, you pick up the rest from the context, and you just figure it out. The crazy thing is that, somehow, it works. Society functions. Except when it doesn't.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是南非的巴别塔。它存在于日常的每一天。每一天，你都会见到因语言不通而困惑的人，他们试图和别人交谈，却完全听不懂对方在说什么。祖鲁语和茨瓦纳语使用的人比较多，聪加语和佩迪语就相对小众。你自己说的语言越大众，你就越不会去学其他语言。而你说的语言越小众，你就越容易再去学两到三种语言。在城市里，大部分人都至少能说一些英语，通常还会一点儿南非荷兰语，这样就够你进行日常活动了。如果你去参加有几十个人的聚会，那很有可能在一段对话里就会穿插两到三种不同的语言。你有时可能会听不懂，有人会来给你翻译个大概，你再从上下文揣摩出剩下的意思，然后你就懂了。奇怪的是，这样的世界反而行得通。我们的社会运转良好。但有时也会出状况。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Of the African languages, Zulu has the largest number of native speakers, but we couldn't keep that without also having Xhosa and Tswana and Ndebele. Then there's Swazi, Tsonga, Venda, Sotho, and Pedi. We tried to keep all the major groups happy, so the next thing we knew we'd made eleven languages official languages. And those are just the languages big enough to demand recognition; there are dozens more.</div>
