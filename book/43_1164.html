<div class="line_en">Mrs. Chester's fair was so very elegant and select that it was considered a great honor by the young ladies of the neighborhood to be invited to take a table, and everyone was much interested in the matter. Amy was asked, but Jo was not, which was fortunate for all parties, as her elbows were decidedly akimbo at this period of her life, and it took a good many hard knocks to teach her how to get on easily. The 'haughty, uninteresting creature' was let severely alone, but Amy's talent and taste were duly complimented by the offer of the art table, and she exerted herself to prepare and secure appropriate and valuable contributions to it.</div>

<div class="line_en">Everything went on smoothly till the day before the fair opened, then there occurred one of the little skirmishes which it is almost impossible to avoid, when some five-and-twenty women, old and young, with all their private piques and prejudices, try to work together.</div>

<div class="line_en">May Chester was rather jealous of Amy because the latter was a greater favorite than herself, and just at this time several trifling circumstances occurred to increase the feeling. Amy's dainty pen-and-ink work entirely eclipsed May's painted vases -- that was one thorn. Then the all conquering Tudor had danced four times with Amy at a late party and only once with May -- that was thorn number two. But the chief grievance that rankled in her soul, and gave an excuse for her unfriendly conduct, was a rumor which some obliging gossip had whispered to her, that the March girls had made fun of her at the Lambs'. All the blame of this should have fallen upon Jo, for her naughty imitation had been too lifelike to escape detection, and the frolicsome Lambs had permitted the joke to escape. No hint of this had reached the culprits, however, and Amy's dismay can be imagined, when, the very evening before the fair, as she was putting the last touches to her pretty table, Mrs. Chester, who, of course, resented the supposed ridicule of her daughter, said, in a bland tone, but with a cold look…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="梅·切斯特相当妒忌艾美，因为艾美比她更招人喜爱。就在那时，发生了一些琐碎小事增加了她的妒忌感。艾美那雅致的钢笔画作品使梅的着色花瓶黯然失色——这是第一个苦恼；最近一次舞会上，迷倒所有姑娘的图德和艾美跳了四次舞，只和梅跳了一次——这是第二个苦恼；压在她心头最大的不是传到她耳中的闲言碎语，说马奇家的女孩们在兰姆家笑话了她，这给了她采取不友好行动的藉口。本来这一切该怪罪乔的，是她活灵活现地模仿梅，谁都能看出来，而那爱闹的兰姆们又让笑话传了出来。两个罪犯对后来的事一无所知，所以可以想象出艾美听了切斯特夫人一番话的沮丧。切斯特夫人听说女儿被人笑话，当然恼火。交易会的前一天晚上，艾美正在为她漂亮的桌子做最后的装饰，切斯特夫人不动声色、冷冷地对她说道——">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I find, dear, that there is some feeling among the young ladies about my giving this table to anyone but my girls. As this is the most prominent, and some say the most attractive table of all, and they are the chief getters-up of the fair, it is thought best for them to take this place. I'm sorry, but I know you are too sincerely interested in the cause to mind a little personal disappointment, and you shall have another table if you like."</div>

<div class="line_en">The little girls hailed Amy and her treasures with delight, which cordial reception somewhat soothed her perturbed spirit, and she fell to work, determined to succeed florally, if she could not artistically. But everything seemed against her. It was late, and she was tired. Everyone was too busy with their own affairs to help her, and the little girls were only hindrances, for the dears fussed and chattered like so many magpies, making a great deal of confusion in their artless efforts to preserve the most perfect order. The evergreen arch wouldn't stay firm after she got it up, but wiggled and threatened to tumble down on her head when the hanging baskets were filled. Her best tile got a splash of water, which left a sepia tear on the Cupid's cheek. She bruised her hands with hammering, and got cold working in a draft, which last affliction filled her with apprehensions for the morrow. Any girl reader who has suffered like afflictions will sympathize with poor Amy and wish her well through her task.</div>

<div class="line_en">In spite of various very natural temptations to resent and retaliate, Amy adhered to her resolution all the next day, bent on conquering her enemy by kindness. She began well, thanks to a silent reminder that came to her unexpectedly, but most opportunely. As she arranged her table that morning, while the little girls were in the anteroom filling the baskets, she took up her pet production, a little book, the antique cover of which her father had found among his treasures, and in which on leaves of vellum she had beautifully illuminated different texts. As she turned the pages rich in dainty devices with very pardonable pride, her eye fell upon one verse that made her stop and think. Framed in a brilliant scrollwork of scarlet, blue and gold, with little spirits of good will helping one another up and down among the thorns and flowers, were the words, "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself."</div>

<div class="line_en">A group of girls were standing about May's table, admiring the pretty things, and talking over the change of saleswomen. They dropped their voices, but Amy knew they were speaking of her, hearing one side of the story and judging accordingly. It was not pleasant, but a better spirit had come over her, and presently a chance offered for proving it. She heard May say sorrowfully…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一群女孩子围站在梅的桌旁，欣赏着漂亮的物品，议论着女售货员的变换。她们压低了声音，可是艾美知道她们在谈论她，她们听了一面之辞并且据之作出判断。这不太令人愉快，但是她的态度已经有了很大的转变。不一会儿，就来了个机会让她证明这一点。她听到梅难过地说——">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I ought, but I don't," thought Amy, as her eye went from the bright page to May's discontented face behind the big vases, that could not hide the vacancies her pretty work had once filled. Amy stood a minute, turning the leaves in her hand, reading on each some sweet rebuke for all heartburnings and uncharitableness of spirit. Many wise and true sermons are preached us every day by unconscious ministers in street, school, office, or home. Even a fair table may become a pulpit, if it can offer the good and helpful words which are never out of season. Amy's conscience preached her a little sermon from that text, then and there, and she did what many of us do not always do, took the sermon to heart, and straightway put it in practice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我应该这样做，可是我没做到，”艾美想。她的目光从鲜艳的书页转向大花瓶后面梅不满意的脸上，那些大花瓶填不了她的那些漂亮作品曾经占据的空间。艾美站了一会儿，翻着手中的书页，每一页都读到一些对记仇、妒忌之心的轻柔指责。每天，我们从街道、学校、办公室以及家庭听到许多明智的、真正的布道，只是没有在意。假如这张交易会桌子能提出富有教益、决不过时的人生哲理，它也能成为布道讲坛。此时此地，艾美的良知向她宣讲了小书上的道理。她做了我们许多人不大做得到的事——从善如流，并立即付诸实施。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Now, that was hard. When we make little sacrifices we like to have them appreciated, at least, and for a minute Amy was sorry she had done it, feeling that virtue was not always its own reward.

<div class="line_cn" title="嗳哟，这太过分了。当我们做出些不大的牺牲时，至少希望别人能欣赏。有一会儿，艾美后悔那样做了，她感到美德并不总是有回报的。但还是有的——正像她很快发觉的——因为，她的情绪开始高涨，她的桌子在她灵巧的双手下开花了，姑娘们非常友好。那个小小的举动似乎令人惊讶地消除了误会。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The art table was the most attractive in the room. There was a crowd about it all day long, and the tenders were constantly flying to and fro with important faces and rattling money boxes. Amy often looked wistfully across, longing to be there, where she felt at home and happy, instead of in a corner with nothing to do. It might seem no hardship to some of us, but to a pretty, blithe young girl, it was not only tedious, but very trying, and the thought of Laurie and his friends made it a real martyrdom.</div>

<div class="line_en">Thanks to the conspirators, the tables were turned that night, for Hayes sent up a wilderness of flowers, with a loverly basket arranged in his best manner for a centerpiece. Then the March family turned out en masse, and Jo exerted herself to some purpose, for people not only came, but stayed, laughing at her nonsense, admiring Amy's taste, and apparently enjoying themselves very much. Laurie and his friends gallantly threw themselves into the breach, bought up the bouquets, encamped before the table, and made that corner the liveliest spot in the room. Amy was in her element now, and out of gratitude, if nothing more, was as spritely and gracious as possible, coming to the conclusion, about that time, that virtue was its own reward, after all.</div>

She reproached herself for her share of the ill feeling and resolved to exonerate Amy as soon as possible. She also discovered what Amy had done about the things in the morning, and considered her a model of magnanimity. As she passed the art table, she glanced over it for her sister's things, but saw no sign of them.
