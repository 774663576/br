<div class="line_en">I lay shivering and gasping in my warm bed for several minutes, trying to break free of the dream. The sky outside my window turned gray and then pale pink while I waited for my heart to slow.</div>

<div class="line_en">Eager to shake off the nightmare, I got dressed and headed down to the kitchen long before I needed to. First I cleaned the already tidy rooms, and then when Charlie was up I made him pancakes. I was much too keyed up to have any interest in eating breakfast myself -- I sat bouncing in my seat while he ate.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="急于摆脱这个噩梦，我赶紧起身穿好衣服，比平时早好多地就下到厨房。首先，我先打扫了一遍已经很整洁的房子，接着当查理起床时，我帮他弄了薄煎饼。我今天实在太过于紧张，以至于心思都没花在吃早饭上——当查理在吃的时候我就在椅子里显得坐立不安。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I don't have that much to do today besides bring the minister, Bells. I'm not likely to forget my only job." Charlie had taken the entire day off for the wedding, and he was definitely at loose ends. Now and then, his eyes flickered furtively to the closet under the stairs, where he kept his fishing gear.</div>

<div class="line_en">Alice's short black hair was not in its usual spiky do -- it was smoothed into sleek pin curls around her pixie face, which wore a contrastingly businesslike expression. She dragged me from the house with barely a "Hey, Charlie" called over her shoulder.</div>

<div class="line_en">Charlie nodded thoughtfully, conceding that he did have the lesser ordeal. I ducked in to kiss the top of his head as I passed -- he blushed and harrumphed -- and then continued on to get the door for my best girlfriend and soon-to-be sister.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“不要浪费嘛，也不想浪费。好好享受这一切吧，因为你将没机会看到屋内的装饰了，时间还未到呢。”她把车停到屋里北边巨大的车库中；埃美特的大吉普并没有停在那里。">查看中文翻译</div>
