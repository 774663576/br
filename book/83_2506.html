<div class="line_en">The lean black-eyed credit jeweler was standing in his entrance in the same position as the afternoon before. He gave me the same knowing look as I turned in. The store looked just the same. The same lamp glowed on the small desk in the corner and the same ash blonde in the same black suede-like dress got up from behind it and came towards me with the same tentative smile on her face.</div>

<div class="line_en">"You -- a -- you -- a --" her throat jammed. I thought she was going to fall on her nose. Her whole body shivered and her face fell apart like a bride's pie crust.

<div class="line_cn" title="“你——呃——你——呃——”她喉头哽塞住了。我觉得她简直要面朝地倒下去。她浑身颤抖，脸四分五裂，活像新娘子和的馅饼皮。她把脸慢慢拼接起来，仿佛纯粹凭借意志力在抬一件重物。那抹笑容重现了，边边角角却是破烂的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I had my mouth open to say something when the partition door opened a foot. The tall dark handsome boy in the jerkin looked out, pale-faced and tight-lipped, saw me, shut the door quickly again, but not before I had seen on the floor behind him a lot of wooden boxes lined with newspapers and packed loosely with books. A man in very new overalls was fussing with them. Some of Geiger's stock was being moved out.</div>

<div class="line_en">He grinned. "My meat, Jack." He tucked the magazine over his rear view mirror and I got into the cab. We went around the block and pulled up across from Geiger's alley, beside another fireplug.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他咧嘴笑了。“你算找对人了，老兄。”他把杂志塞在后视镜上面，我上了车。我们绕过那个街区，在盖革店铺后面的小巷对过停下车，旁边是另一个消防栓。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Ye-es. I know how it is." She shivered a little more and made a faint sucking noise between her bright lips. I went out of the store and west on the boulevard to the corner and north on the street to the alley which ran behind the stores. A small black truck with wire sides and no lettering on it was backed up to Geiger's place. The man in the very new overalls was just heaving a box up on the tailboard. I went back to the boulevard and along the block next to Geiger's and found a taxi standing at a fireplug. A fresh-faced kid was reading a horror magazine behind the wheel. I leaned in and showed him a dollar: "Tail job?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是，是的。我知道你们的名片是怎么回事。”她又颤抖了一小阵，明亮的嘴唇间发出轻轻的吮吸声。我出了店门，在大道上向西走到街角，再沿着马路往北走到那排店面背后的巷子。一辆两边有金属栅栏的黑色小卡车背对盖革的店停着，车上没有印字。那个一身崭新工作服的男子刚把一个箱子搬上卡车后挡板。我返回大道，在与盖革的店相邻的街区沿途发现消防栓旁停着一辆出租车。一个一脸稚气的小伙儿正坐在方向盘后面读一本恐怖故事杂志。我把头探进车窗，给他一块钱。“盯不盯梢？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The man in overalls gunned his motor, shot a glance up and down the alley and ran away fast in the other direction. He turned left out of the alley. We did the same. I caught a glimpse of the truck turning east on Franklin and told my driver to close in a little. He didn't or couldn't do it. I saw the truck two blocks away when we got to Franklin. We had it in sight to Vine and across Vine and all the way to Western. We saw it twice after Western. There was a lot of traffic and the fresh-faced kid tailed from too far back. I was telling him about that without mincing words when the truck, now far ahead, turned north again. The street at which it turned was called Brittany Place. When we got to Brittany Place the truck had vanished.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那穿工作服的男人发动了卡车，上下扫了一眼巷子，往另一个方向飞驰而去。他向左拐出了巷子。我们也一样。我瞥见卡车往东转上了富兰克林大街，便对司机说稍微跟紧点。他没跟紧，也可能是办不到。等我们驶上富兰克林大街时，我看到卡车在前方两个街区。之后的一段路程我们没让卡车离开视线：跟着它到了藤街又穿行而过，一路去往西大道。过了西大道，我们只见着两回那辆卡车。车来车往很多，那毛头小子跟得太靠后了。我骂着粗话说他太慢了，这时那辆遥遥领先的卡车又向北转了。他拐弯的那条路叫布列塔尼街。而当我们到达布列塔尼街的时候，卡车已经不见了。[1]【注：[1]根据地图稍微对这几条街道的方位作一简要的交代：富兰克林大街（Franklin Ave）东西走向，当车由西向东行驶时，该大街先后与藤街（Vine St）和西大道（Western Ave）两条南北走向的干道相交。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The fresh-faced kid made comforting sounds at me through the panel and we went up the hill at four miles an hour looking for the truck behind bushes. Two blocks up, Brittany Place swung to the east and met Randall Place in a tongue of land on which there was a white apartment house with its front on Randall Place and its basement garage opening on Brittany. We were going past that and the fresh-faced kid was telling me the truck couldn't be far away when I looked through the arched entrance of the garage and saw it back in the dimness with its rear doors open again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那毛头小伙在隔板那头说着安慰我的话，我们以四英里的时速驶上山坡，在灌木丛后面寻找那辆卡车的踪影。往上两个街区，布列塔尼街向东拐弯，在一处山岬与兰德尔街交汇。山岬上有栋白色公寓楼，正门开在兰德尔街，地下车库的入口却在布列塔尼街。我们驱车经过，那小伙子对我说卡车不会走远的，这时候我朝车库的拱门里看了一眼，只见那辆卡车就停在昏暗的一角，后门又打开了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We went around to the front of the apartment house and I got out. There was nobody in the lobby, no switchboard. A wooden desk was pushed back against the wall beside a panel of gilt mailboxes. I looked the names over. A man named Joseph Brody had Apartment 405. A man named Joe Brody had received five thousand dollars from General Sternwood to stop playing with Carmen and find some other little girl to play with. It could be the same Joe Brody. I felt like giving odds on it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们绕到公寓楼正门前，我下了车。大厅里没有人，也没有电话转接台。一张木桌靠墙放着，墙边的板壁上挂着许多镀金信箱。我浏览了一遍住户名字。有个叫乔·布罗迪的男子住在405室。有个叫乔·布罗迪的男子收了斯特恩伍德将军五千块，才跟卡门断掉往来，换了别的小姑娘厮混。这两人可能是同一个乔·布罗迪。我都想押注赌一把了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I went around an elbow of wall to the foot of tiled stairs and the shaft of the automatic elevator. The top of the elevator was level with the floor. There was a door beside the shaft lettered "Garage." I opened it and went down narrow steps to the basement. The automatic elevator was propped open and the man in new overalls was grunting hard as he stacked heavy boxes in it. I stood beside him and lit a cigarette and watched him. He didn't like my watching him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我一个急转弯拐过墙角，走到铺了瓷砖的楼梯底下，眼前是电梯井。此时的电梯顶端与地板持平。电梯井旁有扇门，门上印着“车库”。我打开门，沿着促狭的台阶走进地下室。电梯门被撑开着，那个穿崭新工作服的男人正在里面堆放木箱，一边不停嘟嘟囔囔。我站到他身旁，点上一根烟，看着他。我看得他很不舒服。">查看中文翻译</div>
