<div class="line_en">Volantis closed its gates at dark, and the guardsmen on its northern gate were grumbling impatiently at the stragglers. They joined the queue behind a wagon laden with limes and oranges. The guards motioned the wagon through with their torches but took a harder look at the big Andal on his warhorse, with his longsword and his mail. A captain was summoned. Whilst he and the knight exchanged some words in Volantene, one of the guardsmen pulled off his clawed gauntlet and gave Tyrion's head a rub. "I'm full of good fortune," the dwarf told him. "Cut me loose, friend, and I'll see you're well rewarded."</div>

<div class="line_en">Inside the city walls, they rode past guildhalls, markets, and bathhouses. Fountains splashed and sang in the centers of wide squares, where men sat at stone tables, moving cyvasse pieces and sipping wine from glass flutes as slaves lit ornate lanterns to hold the dark at bay. Palms and cedars grew along the cobbled road, and monuments stood at every junction. Many of the statues lacked heads, the dwarf noted, yet even headless they still managed to look imposing in the purple dusk.</div>

<div class="line_en">As the warhorse plodded south along the river, the shops grew smaller and meaner, the trees along the street became a row of stumps. Cobblestones gave way to devilgrass beneath their horse's hooves, then to soft wet mud the color of a baby's nightsoil. The little bridges that spanned the small streams that fed the Rhoyne creaked alarmingly beneath their weight. Where a fort had once overlooked the river now stood a broken gate, gaping open like an old man's toothless mouth. Goats could be glimpsed peering over the parapets.</div>

<div class="line_en">Old Volantis, first daughter of Valyria, the dwarf mused. Proud Volantis, queen of the Rhoyne and mistress of the Summer Sea, home to noble lords and lovely ladies of the most ancient blood. Never mind the packs of naked children that roamed the alleys screaming in shrill voices, or the bravos standing in the doors of wineshops fingering their sword hilts, or the slaves with their bent backs and tattooed faces who scurried everywhere like cockroaches. Mighty Volantis, grandest and most populous of the Nine Free Cities. Ancient wars had depopulated much of the city, however, and large areas of Volantis had begun to sink back into the mud on which it stood. Beautiful Volantis, city of fountains and flowers. But half the fountains were dry, half the pools cracked and stagnant. Flowering vines sent up creepers from every crack in the wall or pavement, and young trees had taken root in the walls of abandoned shops and roofless temples.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="古瓦兰提斯，瓦雷利亚的第一个女儿，侏儒打趣。骄傲的瓦兰提斯，罗伊达的女王，盛夏海的女主人，古老血统的可爱女士和高贵的领主们的归宿。哦，还是忽略在那些在巷子里光着屁股尖叫乱窜的孩子们吧，或者那些到处都是的佝偻着肩背满脸纹身的奴隶们像蟑螂一样步履不停的身影。强大的瓦兰提斯，九个自由城邦里最大与人口最多的城邦。但是古代的战争已经使这个城市人口锐减，但不管怎样，瓦兰提斯的大片土地还是开始吞噬着屹立其上的广大地区，尘归尘，土归土。美丽的瓦兰提斯，泉水与鲜花之城。但是它半数的喷泉已经干涸，一半的水池业已干裂停滞。开花的藤本植物爬满了墙上和人行道的每个裂缝，幼嫩的树苗则在废弃的商铺和无顶的庙宇墙上扎根。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And then there was the smell. It hung in the hot, humid air, rich, rank, pervasive. There's fish in it, and flowers, and some elephant dung as well. Something sweet and something earthy and something dead and rotten. "This city smells like an old whore," Tyrion announced. "Like some sagging slattern who has drenched her privy parts in perfume to drown the stench between her legs. Not that I am complaining. With whores, the young ones smell much better, but the old ones know more tricks."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着还有那股气味，飘散在潮湿炎热的空气里，浓烈、特别、无处不在。混杂着鱼腥、花香和大象的粪臭，甜美的、泥土味的、死亡的、腐烂的。“这个城市闻起来就像个明日黄花的妓女，”提利昂称。“一个皮肤松弛的老妇用香水涂抹私处以掩盖双腿间的恶臭。不是我在抱怨，关于妓女，年轻点的闻起来好些，但是老的那些技巧更甚。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Farther south, signs of prosperity began to reappear. Abandoned buildings were seen less often, the naked children vanished, the bravos in the doorways seemed more sumptuously dressed. A few of the inns they passed actually looked like places where a man might sleep without fear of having his throat slit. Lanterns swung from iron stanchions along the river road, swaying when the wind blew. The streets grew broader, the buildings more imposing. Some were topped with great domes of colored glass. In the gathering dusk, with fires lit beneath them, the domes glowed blue and red and green and purple.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="更远的南方，繁荣的景象又开始显现。废弃的房屋不那么常见了，没穿衣服的孩子也消失了，而门口站着的亡命徒们则衣着华丽起来。他们路过的有些旅馆看起来睡觉时候也无须过虑会被抹了脖子。路边一排铁柱上挂着随风摇晃的灯笼。街道变的宽阔，建筑也更加庄严。有些顶着彩绘玻璃的圆顶，在聚拢的黄昏中，有着点燃的火焰在下面燃烧，圆顶游览变红接着变绿，最后变紫。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Tyrion swallowed his retort. His lip was still fat and swollen from the last time he had pushed the big knight too far. Hard hands and no sense of humor makes for a bad marriage. That much he'd learned on the road from Selhorys. His thoughts went to his boot, to the mushrooms in the toe. His captor had not searched him quite as thoroughly as he might have. There is always that escape. Cersei will not have me alive, at least.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="提利昂咽下了他的反驳。自从上次他将大个的骑士推了老远后他的嘴唇依旧又肥又肿。一双硬手而没有幽默对婚姻来说简直是灾难。自赛尔霍利斯以来的一路上他应该发现这点了。他的思绪回到了他的靴子上，那些脚趾头处的蘑菇。他的捕获者没像他应有的那样彻底搜查他。总有逃脱的方法。至少保证瑟熙不会捉到一个活着的我。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Even so, there was something in the air that made Tyrion uneasy. West of the Rhoyne, he knew, the wharves of Volantis teemed with sailors, slaves, and traders, and the wineshops, inns, and brothels all catered to them. East of the river, strangers from across the seas were seen less seldom. We are not wanted here, the dwarf realized.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="即使如此，空气中依旧流淌着某些让提利昂柑橘不舒服的东西。罗伊达的西岸，他知道，瓦兰提斯的码头上挤满了水手，奴隶和商人，而酒馆，旅舍还有妓院都应和着他们的需要。而在河东岸，狭海对面的异乡人则少见的多。我们在这里不受欢迎，侏儒发现。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Farther on, they fell in behind a smaller elephant, white as old bone and pulling an ornate cart. "Is an oxcart an oxcart without an ox?" Tyrion asked his captor. When that sally got no response, he lapsed back into silence, contemplating the rolling rump of the white dwarf elephant ahead of them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="继续向前，他们跟在了一头小一点的象后面，它像白骨一样白，拉着一辆华丽的马车。“牛车是不是一个没牛的牛车？”提利昂问他的捕获者。骑士以沉默回应他的妙语，于是他也重新回归沉默，转而凝视前面那头晃动着臀部的白矮象。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Volantis was overrun with white dwarf elephants. As they drew closer to the Black Wall and the crowded districts near the Long Bridge, they saw a dozen of them. Big grey elephants were not uncommon either -- huge beasts with castles on their backs. And in the half-light of evening the dung carts had come out, attended by half-naked slaves whose task it was to shovel up the steaming piles left by elephants both great and small. Swarms of flies followed the carts, so the dung slaves had flies tattooed upon their cheeks, to mark them for what they were. There's a trade for my sweet sister, Tyrion mused. She'd look so pretty with a little shovel and flies tattooed on those sweet pink cheeks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="瓦兰提斯大街小巷到处都是白矮象。当他们走到离黑墙和长桥附近拥挤的街区更近的地方时，他们看见了很多白象。巨大的灰象也不是不常见——背上拖着城堡的巨型野兽。在夜晚不太明亮的光线下，那些运粪车出来了，被那些半裸的奴隶推着铲除那些大象小象留下的热气腾腾的粪便，这就是他们的工作。总有成群的苍蝇紧跟着那些推车，所以这些运粪奴隶们的脸颊上就纹上了苍蝇以彰显他们的职业。这个对我那甜美的姐姐来说倒是个不错的交易，提利昂想到。她可爱的粉色脸颊上要是纹上一个小小的铲子和几只苍蝇看起来可漂亮极了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The first time they passed an elephant, Tyrion could not help but stare. There had been an elephant in the menagerie at Lannisport when he had been a boy, but she had died when he was seven… and this great grey behemoth looked to be twice her size.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当他们第一次经过一头大象时，提利昂不可抑制的盯着它。在他还是个孩子的时候，兰尼斯特港的小动物园里曾经有头大象（竟然有动物园…太高级了），但是在他七岁那年她就死了…而这只灰白的巨兽看起来有她两倍那么大。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">By then they had slowed to a crawl. The river road was thick with traffic, almost all of it flowing south. The knight went with it, a log caught in a current. Tyrion eyed the passing throngs. Nine men of every ten bore slave marks on their cheeks. "So many slaves… where are they all going?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时候他们简直像爬一样的前进。沿河的道路挤满了车辆行人，这几乎是一股向南的洪流。骑士就夹在里面，像一根顺应水流的浮木。提利昂盯着过往的人潮。十个里面有九个的脸上都纹着奴隶标记。“这么多的奴隶…他们都要去哪儿？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Three blocks later the street opened up before them onto a huge torchlit plaza, and there it stood. Seven save me, that's got to be three times the size of the Great Sept of Baelor. An enormity of pillars, steps, buttresses, bridges, domes, and towers flowing into one another as if they had all been chiseled from one collossal rock, the Temple of the Lord of Light loomed like Aegon's High Hill. A hundred hues of red, yellow, gold, and orange met and melded in the temple walls, dissolving one into the other like clouds at sunset. Its slender towers twisted ever upward, frozen flames dancing as they reached for the sky. Fire turned to stone. Huge nightfires burned beside the temple steps, and between them the High Priest had begun to speak.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="三个街道之外，道路在他们眼前开阔起来，接着他们就来到了一个巨型的火炬照明的广场。七神救我，这足有贝勒大圣堂的三倍大。数不清的支柱、台阶、墙垛、拱梁、圆顶，那些高塔鳞次栉比的争相攀附好像他们都是从一块整个的巨石上雕刻出来的，光之神之庙隐似伊耿高峰（Aegon’s High Hill）。庙墙呈现出红黄金橘叠加混合形成的百种色彩，如日落时的晚霞融汇层叠。它细长的高塔盘旋向上，在它们直指天际的同时舞动着凝固的火焰。火焰凝成了石块。神庙梯级边燃烧着巨型的夜火，在其中央是刚刚开始演讲的大神僧。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Benerro's high voice carried well. Tall and thin, he had a drawn face and skin white as milk. Flames had been tattooed across his cheeks and chin and shaven head to make a bright red mask that crackled about his eyes and coiled down and around his lipless mouth.

<div class="line_en">The knight had forced their way through most of the press at the back of the plaza, ignoring the curses that were flung at them as they passed. One man stepped in front of them, but his captor gripped the hilt of his longsword and drew it just far enough to show a foot of naked steel. The man melted away, and all at once an alley opened up before them. The knight urged his mount to a trot, and they left the crowd behind them.

The dwarf was pulled down roughly from the saddle and lashed to a post whilst his captor woke the stable's owner and haggled with him over the price of his horse and saddle.

That proved shuttered too, but opened quick enough at the knight's shout. The smith gave Tyrion a squint, then nodded and accepted a fistful of coins. "Come here," the knight told his prisoner. He drew his dagger and slit Tyrion's bonds apart. "My thanks," said the dwarf as he rubbed his wrists, but the knight only laughed and said, "Save your gratitude for someone who deserves it, Imp.

Beyond the arch stretched the great span that the Valyrians had built at the height of their glory, its fused stone roadway supported by massive piers.

<div class="line_en">Buildings rose to either side of them: shops and temples, taverns and inns, cyvasse parlors and brothels. Most were three or four stories tall, each floor overhanging the one beneath it. Their top floors almost kissed. Crossing the bridge felt like passing through a torchlit tunnel. Along the span were shops and stalls of every sort; weavers and lacemakers displayed their wares cheek by jowl with glassblowers, candlemakers, and fishwives selling eels and oysters. Each goldsmith had a guard at his door, and every spicer had two, for their goods were twice as valuable. Here and there, between the shops, a traveler might catch a glimpse of the river he was crossing. To the north the Rhoyne was a broad black ribbon bright with stars, five times as wide as the Blackwater Rush at King's Landing. South of the bridge the river opened up to embrace the briny sea.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was well they were afoot. A third of the way out, a wagon laden with melons had gotten its wheels tangled with one piled high with silken carpets and brought all wheeled traffic to a halt. Much of the foot traffic had stopped as well, to watch the drivers curse and scream at one another, but the knight grabbed hold of Tyrion's chain and bulled a path through the throng for both of them.

<div class="line_en">From the far end of the Long Bridge, it was only a short walk through the teeming waterfront districts of the west bank, down torchlit streets crowded with sailors, slaves, and drunken merrymakers. Once an elephant lumbered past with a dozen half-naked slave girls waving from the castle on its back, teasing passersby with glimpses of their breasts and crying, "Malaquo, Malaquo." They made such an entrancing sight that Tyrion almost waddled right into the steaming pile of dung the elephant had left to mark its passage.

The other opened on the square below. Fishermonger's Square, Mormont called it. As tight as the chains were, Tyrion found he could see out the latter by leaning sideways and letting the iron ring support his weight. Not as long a fall as the one from Lysa Arryn's sky cells, but it would leave me just as dead. Perhaps if I were drunk…</div>

<div class="line_en">His captor returned shortly, carrying two tankards and a roasted duck. He kicked the door shut, ripped the duck in two, and tossed half of it to Tyrion. He would have snatched it from the air, but his chains brought him up short when he tried to lift his arms. Instead the bird struck his temple and slid hot and greasy down his face, and he had to hunker down and stretch for it with fetters clanking. He got it on the third try and tore into it happily with his teeth. "Some ale to wash this down?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Even at this hour the square was crowded, with sailors roistering, whores prowling for custom, and merchants going about their business. A red priestess scurried past, attended by a dozen acolytes with torches, their robes whisking about their ankles. Elsewhere a pair of cyvasse players waged war outside a tavern. A slave stood beside their table, holding a lantern over the board. Tyrion could hear a woman singing. The words were strange, the tune was soft and sad. If I knew what she was singing, I might cry. Closer to hand, a crowd was gathering around a pair of jugglers throwing flaming torches at each other.</div>

<div class="line_en">His wrist was throbbing where he'd torn the skin, and his fetters made it impossible for him to sit, let alone stretch out. The best he could do was twist sideways to lean against the wall, and before long he began to lose all feeling in his hands. When he moved to relieve the strain, sensation came flooding back as pain. He had to grind his teeth to keep from screaming. He wondered how much his father had hurt when the quarrel punched through his groin, what Shae had felt as he twisted the chain around her lying throat, what Tysha had been feeling as they raped her. His sufferings were nothing compared to their own, but that did not make him hurt any less. Just make it stop.</div>

Whilst other men built the ships and sailed them, he built piers and storehouses, brokered cargoes, changed money, insured shipowners against the hazards of the sea. He dealt in slaves as well. When he grew besotted with one of them, a bedslave trained at Yunkai in the way of seven sighs, it was a great scandal… and a greater scandal when he freed her and took her for his wife. After he died, she carried on his ventures. No freedman may dwell within the Black Wall, so she was compelled to sell Vogarro's manse. She took up residence at the Merchant's House. That was thirty-two years ago, and she remains here to this day. That's her behind you, back by the courtyard, holding court at her customary table. No, don't look. There's someone with her now.

<div class="line_en">Then seven hells broke out at once.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ser Jorah started to rise, the widow snapped her fan closed, her scarred man slid out of the shadows… and behind them a girl screamed. Tyrion spun just in time to see the dwarf rushing toward him. She's a girl, he realized all at once, a girl dressed up in man's clothes. And she means to gut me with that knife.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="乔拉爵士开始起身，寡妇“啪”地合上了他的扇子，她的疤脸男从阴影里滑出…而他们身后一个女孩尖叫起来。提利昂刚好转身看见一个侏儒向他奔来。那是个女孩，他立即认出来，一个穿着男人衣服的女孩。而她准备用那把刀宰了我。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">… and suddenly she was rising off the floor, legs kicking wildly as she struggled in Ser Jorah's grasp. "No!" she wailed, in the Common Tongue of Westeros. "Let go!" Tyrion heard her tunic rip as she fought to free herself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="…接着她被从地面拎起，在乔拉爵士的紧抓下两条腿疯狂得乱踢。“不！”她用维斯特洛伊通用语哭号。“放下我！”提利昂听见她挣扎时衣衫撕裂的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For half a heartbeat Ser Jorah, the widow, and the scarred man stood still as stone. Idlers watched from nearby tables, sipping ale and wine, but no one moved to interfere. Tyrion had to move both hands at once, but his chains had just enough give for him to reach the flagon on the table. He closed his fist around it, spun, dashed its contents into the face of the charging dwarf girl, then threw himself to one side to avoid her knife. The flagon shattered underneath him as the floor came up to smack him in the head. Then the girl was on him once again. Tyrion rolled on one side as she buried the knife blade in the floorboards, yanked it free, raised it again…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在心跳半拍的时间内，乔拉爵士、寡妇和疤脸男都像石头一样定住了。旁边桌子的无关者呷了一口美酒和其他美食，但是没有人站出来干预。提利昂不得不立刻移动双手，但是他的锁链只允许他够到桌上的大酒壶。他抱着它旋转，将里面的液体泼向向他冲过来讨债的侏儒女孩的脸，然后闪到一边躲避女孩的刀子。酒壶摔的粉碎的同时，他就头撞地面。接着那个女孩又追着他来了。提利昂从一边滚到另一边躲避着女孩刀子一下下落下嵌入地面又拔出再刺…">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Who killed him?" asked Mormont. "Sailors. Sailors from the Seven Kingdoms. There were five of them, drunk. They saw us jousting in the square and followed us. When they realized I was a girl they let me go, but they took my brother and killed him. They cut his head off."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“谁杀了他？”莫尔蒙问。“水手们。来自七大王国的水手们。他们五个都喝的烂醉，他们看见我们在广场杂耍就跟踪了我们。当他们意识到我是个女孩就放走了我，但是他们带走了我的兄弟把他的头砍了下来。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tyrion felt a sudden shock of recognition. They saw us jousting in the square. He knew who the girl was then. "Did you ride the pig?" he asked her. "Or the dog?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="提利昂突然认出来了。他们看见我们在广场杂耍。他接着就知道这个女孩是谁了。“你是不是骑着一只猪？”他问她。“或者狗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"They killed him." All the fight went out of her at that. She hung limply in Mormont's grasp as her eyes filled with tears. "My brother. They took him and they killed him."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他们杀了他。”她说的时候再也不挣扎了，她无力地吊在莫尔蒙的手上眼中充满了泪水。“我的兄弟，他们带走了他杀了他。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mormont had her by the collar with one hand. With the other he wrenched the dagger from her grasp. "Enough."</div>

<div class="line_en">The landlord made his appearance then, a cudgel in his hand. When he saw the broken flagon, he uttered a blistering curse and demanded to know what had happened here. "Dwarf fight," replied the Tyroshi with the purple beard, chuckling.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着店家来了，抓了一只棍子。当他看见碎裂的大酒壶时他狠狠的咒骂然后询问发生了什么。“侏儒打架，”一个有紫色胡须的泰洛西人轻笑着说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The dwarfs from Joffrey's wedding. It was their show that had started all the trouble that night. How strange, to encounter them again half a world away. Though perhaps not so strange as that. If they had half the wits of their pig, they would have fled King's Landing the night Joff died, before Cersei could assign them some share of blame in her son's death. "Let her down, ser," he told Ser Jorah Mormont. "She won't do us any harm."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那些乔佛里婚礼上的侏儒们。正是他们的表演拉开了那个混乱之夜的序幕。真奇怪，在半个世界外有遇到了他们。也许也不是那么奇怪，如果他们有他们骑的猪一半聪明的话就会在当晚在，瑟熙悬赏他们也参与了那场谋杀之前立马逃出君临。“放开她，爵士，”他告诉乔拉？莫尔蒙爵士。“她不会再对我们不利了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ser Jorah dumped the dwarf girl on the floor. "I am sorry for your brother… but we had no part in his murder."</div>

<div class="line_en">"He did." The girl pushed herself to her knees, clutching her torn, wine-drenched tunic to small, pale breasts. "It was him they wanted. They thought Oppo was him." The girl was weeping, begging for help from anyone who would listen. "He should die, the way my poor brother died. Please. Someone help me. Someone kill him." The landlord seized her roughly by one arm and wrenched her back to her feet, shouting in Volantene, demanding to know who was going to pay for this damage.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他参与了。”女孩把身体蜷到膝盖，拉了拉她撕坏的沾满了葡萄酒的衣服盖住小小的乳房。“他们想要的是他。他们把奥博当成了他。”女孩哭泣着，向任何聆听的人祈求。“他必须死，就像我可怜的兄弟那样。求求你们，任何人，杀了他。”店家粗暴的用一只手捉住她把她的背拧道脚上，用瓦兰提斯语大骂，想知道谁来为这场损失赔付。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The widow of the waterfront gave Mormont a cool look. "Knights defend the weak and protect the innocent, they say. And I am the fairest maid in all Volantis." Her laugh was full of scorn. "What do they call you, child?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"You are too kind." Tyrion gave her his sweetest smile. "Perhaps you would remove these charming iron bracelets as well? This monster has but half a nose, and it itches most abominably. The chains are too short for me to scratch it. I'll make you a gift of them, and gladly."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“您真好心。”提利昂给她一个最甜美的微笑。“也许你好心到可以帮我把这些铁枷锁打开？这个小怪物有半个发痒的鼻子而锁链阻止他去挠挠它。我会很高兴用这些锁链做个精美的礼物送您的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The old woman called out to the landlord in the tongue of Old Volantis. Tyrion knew enough to understand that she was telling him to take the dwarf girl up to her rooms, give her wine, and find some clothes for her to wear.</div>

<div class="line_en">When they were gone, the widow studied Tyrion, her black eyes shining. "Monsters should be larger, it seems to me. You are worth a lordship back in Westeros, little man. Here, I fear, your worth is somewhat less. But I think I had best help you after all. Volantis is no safe place for dwarfs, it seems."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Every man ever taken by slavers sings that same sad song. I dare not help you… here." She leaned forward again. "Two days from now, the cog Selaesori Qhoran will set sail for Qarth by way of New Ghis, carrying tin and iron, bales of wool and lace, fifty Myrish carpets, a corpse pickled in brine, twenty jars of dragon peppers, and a red priest. Be on her when she sails."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“如您所愿。”提利昂回忆微笑。“若我是个自由热血的瓦兰提斯人，你参选元老时会得到我的选票的，亲爱的女士。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"How generous. But I have worn iron in my time, and now I find that I prefer gold and silver. And sad to say, this is Volantis, where fetters and chains are cheaper than day-old bread and it is forbidden to help a slave escape."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“真是慷慨，但是我早就有了旧铁，现在我更喜欢金银。虽然很难过但我不得不说，这是瓦兰提斯，手铐脚镣比旧面包还便宜，而帮助一个奴隶逃走就更不被允许了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我们会的，”提利昂说，“谢谢。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“她不会到达Qarth的，班奈罗从他的火焰中预见了。”干瘪的老太婆诡异地笑了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I am no lady," the widow replied, "just Vogarro's whore. You want to be gone from here before the tigers come. Should you reach your queen, give her a message from the slaves of Old Volantis." She touched the faded scar upon her wrinkled cheek, where her tears had been cut away. "Tell her we are waiting. Tell her to come soon."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我可不是什么女士，”寡妇回答，“只是个佛加罗的妓女。你一定想在老虎来之前离开这里的。当你到你的女王那里时，记得带封来自古瓦伦提斯奴隶们的信。”她摸了摸她阡陌纵横的脸颊上眼泪图腾被剔除后留下的褪色的疤痕。“告诉她我们会在这里等着她，请快点来。”">查看中文翻译</div>
