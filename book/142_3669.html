<div class="line_en">Freddie greeted his brother with a warm embrace. Freddie was much stouter, more benevolent-looking, cheerful, and far more dandified. He wore an exquisitely tailored gray silk and accessories to match. His hair was razor cut and arranged as carefully as a movie star's, his face glowed with perfect barbering and his hands were manicured. He was an altogether different man than the one who had been shipped out of New York four years before.</div>

<div class="line_en">Michael smiled at his brother. "You're looking pretty good too. Kay would have come out this time, but she's carrying another kid and she has the baby to look after. Besides this is business, Freddie, I have to fly back tomorrow night or the morning after."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈克尔看着他哥哥，微笑了。“你也很清秀嘛。恺本来这次也要一道来的，但她又怀孕了，还要照顾孩子。而且这次是来办正经事的，弗烈特，我明天晚上或后天早晨就得坐飞机回去。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Hagen shook his head. Freddie had greeted him much less affectionately than Michael, but Hagen understood. Freddie was on his father's shit list and Freddie naturally blamed the Consigliere for not straightening things out. Hagen would gladly have done so, but he didn't know why Freddie was in his father's bad graces. The Don did not give voice to specific grievances. He just made his displeasure felt.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="黑根摇摇头。弗烈特在欢迎他时没有像欢迎迈克尔那么热情，这里面的原因，黑根心里明白。弗烈特在他父亲心目中是个窝囊废，因而他理所当然地要责怪这个参谋没有把事情圆通好。黑根本来是乐于此道的，但却苦于不知道弗烈特为什么引起他父亲的恶感的内情。老头子这个人向来不提具体的心酸事。他只让人家感到他不高兴罢了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Michael said pleasantly, "Let's save Moe Greene to the end, OK? Ask Johnny Fontane and Nino up to eat with us. And Lucy and her doctor friend. We can talk while we eat." He turned to Hagen. "Anybody you want to add to that, Tom?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈克尔愉快地说：“咱们还是把莫·格林放在最后，行吗？先请约翰呢·方檀和尼诺两个同咱们一道吃饭。还有躇西和她那个医生朋友。吃饭的时候，咱们可以随便谈谈。”他回头又对黑根说：“汤姆，你看还要增加什么人？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You have to eat something first," Freddie said. "We've got a great chef in the hotel, you'll get the best food you ever ate. Go take your shower and change and everything will be set up right here. I have all the people you want to see lined up, they'll be waiting around for when you're ready, I just have to call them."</div>

<div class="line_en">It was after midnight before they gathered around the special dinner table set up in Michael's suite. Lucy kissed Michael and didn't comment on his face looking so much better after the operation. Jules Segal boldly studied the repaired cheekbone and said to Michael, "A good job. It's knitted nicely. Is the sinus OK?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当他们在迈克尔那套房间里围着那张餐桌坐下来的时候，已经半夜过后了。璐西吻了一下迈克尔，但却没有评论他那张动过整容手术后比以前清秀得多的脸。裘里斯·西加尔冒冒失失地仔细看了修整好了的颊骨之后，对迈克尔说：“手术很高明，缝合得好极了，鼻窦感到还好吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dinner focused on Michael as they ate. They all noted his resemblance in speech and manner to the Don. In some curious way he inspired the same respect, the same awe, and yet he was perfectly natural, at pains to put everyone at their ease. Hagen as usual remained in the background. The new man they did not know; Albert Neri was also very quiet and unobtrusive. He had claimed he was not hungry and sat in an armchair close to the door reading a local newspaper.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大家在吃饭的时候都把注意力集中到了迈克尔的身上。他们大家都看出了，他在谈吐与举止方面都很像他老子。说起来也奇怪得很，他在人们心目中受到了同样的尊重，同样的敬畏，然而他却处之泰然，而且还挖空心思地使大家不受拘束，黑根一如既往，付愿处于不引人注目的地位。他们不认识的生人亚伯特·奈里也是个非常本分、不愿出风头的人。他早已声明说他肚子不饿，因而坐在靠门边的一把扶手椅子上，埋头看一张本地报纸。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Fine," Michael said. "Thanks for helping out."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“很好，”迈克尔说，“谢谢你帮了个大忙。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After they had had a few drinks and food, the waiters were dismissed. Michael spoke to Johnny Fontane. "Hear your voice is back as good as ever, you got all your old fans back. Congratulations."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们在喝了点酒、吃了点饭菜之后，就不让招待员再来了。迈克尔对约翰呢·方檀说：“听说你的嗓音恢复得同以前一样好了。原来的约翰呢又回来了，恭喜！恭喜！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Thanks," Johnny said. He was curious about exactly why Michael wanted to see him. What favor would he be asked?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“谢谢，”约翰呢说。他急于想知道迈克尔究竟为什么要见他。迈克尔可能对他提出什么要求呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Michael addressed them all in general. "The Corleone Family is thinking of moving out here to Vegas. Selling out all our interests in the olive oil business and settling here. The Don and Hagen and myself have talked it over and we think here is where the future is for the Family. That doesn't mean right now or next year. It may take two, three, even four years to get things squared away. But that's the general plan. Some friends of ours own a good percentage of this hotel and casino so that will be our foundation. Moe Greene will sell us his interest so it can be wholly owned by friends of the Family."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈克尔对大家发表演说了：“考利昂家族正在考虑把大本营搬到韦加斯来。把橄榄油生意方面的产业统统卖掉之后就搬到这儿来安家落户。老头子和黑根还有我本人已经把这个问题讨论过了，我们一致认为这儿就是咱们家族的未来的大本营。这并不是说立即要办或明年就要办，这可能需要两年、三年，甚至四年时间，才可能把准备工作搞好。而目前，这也只能算是基本方案。咱们的朋友拥有这个旅社及其附属的赌博资产的大部分，这就是咱们将来的基础。莫·格林会把他的股份卖给咱们。这样一来，这个旅社及其附属的赌博业就可能完全属于咱们家族的朋友所有。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The words were said in an ordinary voice, yet the effect was chilling, perhaps because it was a favorite phrase of the Don's. Michael turned to Johnny Fontane. "The Don is counting on you to help us get started. It's been explained to us that entertainment will be the big factor in drawing gamblers. We hope you'll sign a contract to appear five times a year for maybe a week-long engagement. We hope your friends in movies do the same. You've done them a lot of favors, now you can call them in."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那句话是用普普通通的语气说出来的，然而却产生了令人不寒而栗的效果，也许因为那句话是老头子的口头禅。迈克尔又回头对约翰呢·方檀说：“老头子指望你能帮助我们开个头。有人对我们说，什么文娱节目将是招揽赌徒的一个很有效的手段。我们希望你签一个合同，每年来五次，总共大约一周的工作量。我们还希望你电影界的那些朋友也部分别签一个这样的合同，你给他们吃了很多甜头，如今可以请他们来赏光赏光嘛。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Michael said quietly, "I'll make him an offer he can't refuse."</div>

<div class="line_en">Freddie's moon face was anxious. "Mike, you sure about Moe Greene selling? He never mentioned it to me and he loves the business. I really don't think he'll sell."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="弗烈特那月亮型的脸忧虑起来了。“迈克，你有把握让莫·格林卖掉他的股份？他从前可从来没有对我说过呀，而我知道，他是舍不得丢掉这个生意的。我真的觉得他不愿意卖掉他的股份。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Sure," Johnny said. "I'll do anything for my Godfather, you know that, Mike." But there was just the faint shadow of doubt in his voice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“行，”约翰呢说，“为我教父，我什么都愿意于。这点你是知道的。话虽这么说，但他的声音里却流露出了一丁点儿犹豫不决的样子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Michael smiled and said, "You won't lose money on the deal and neither will your friends. You get points in the hotel, and if there's somebody else you think important enough, they get some points too. Maybe you don't believe me, so let me say I'm speaking the Don's words."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈克尔笑了一下，说：这样的交易，你不会在钱上吃亏的，你那些朋友也不会在钱上吃亏。你在旅社里可以分红。要是有别的什么人你认为是重要的，他们也可以分红。也许你不相信我的话，那就让我声明，我是转达老头子的原后。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Johnny understood immediately that he meant the Corleone Family owned the three hotels, with their casinos. And that there would be plenty of points to give out.</div>

<div class="line_en">Johnny said hurriedly, "I believe you, Mike. But there's ten more hotels and casinos being built on the Strip right now. When you come in, the market may be glutted, you may be too late with all that competition already there."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="约翰呢连忙说：“我相信你的话，迈克。但是，眼下就有十个旅社和旅社附设的赌场正在沿河一带兴建。等你插手的时候，市场上可能早已饱和了，你可能挤不进早已成形的竞争局面了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Michael turned to Lucy and Jules Segal. "I owe you," he said to Jules. "I hear you want to go back to cutting people up and that hospitals won't let you use their facilities because of that old abortion business. I have to know from you, is that what you want?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈克尔回头望着璐西和裘里斯·西加尔。“我感激你，”他对裘里斯说，“我听说你想回头去干把人切成碎片的工作，而各个医院都因为堕胎的事而不让你利用他们的设备。我必须直接听听你自己的意见，你真想口头干那样的工作吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Michael nodded absentmindedly. "Sure, you're right. But some friends of mine, pretty well-known people, are going to build a big hospital for Las Vegas. The town will need it the way it's growing and the way it's projected to grow. Maybe they'll let you into the operating room if it's put to them right. Hell, how many surgeons as good as you can they get to come out to this desert? Or any half as good? We'll be doing the hospital a favor. So stick around. I hear you and Lucy are going to get married?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈克尔心不在焉地点了点头。“当然罗。你说的也对。但是，我的一些朋友，他们都是相当有名望的人物，正打算在韦加斯修建一个大医院。这个城镇发展得很快，城镇规划也很宏大，显然需要大医院。要是向他们提出正当理由，他们也许会让你在手术室工作。哎呀，他们能找几个像你这样高明的外科医生到这个沙漠里来工作？或者，像你一半那么高明的医生，能找到几个？咱们实际上是在帮医院的忙。这样，你就等着吧，我听说你同璐西快要结婚了？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Michael smiled at her. "I'm not sore." He turned to Jules. "That was a dumb thing for you to say. The Corleone Family has pulled some strings for you. Do you think I'm so stupid I'd ask you to do things you'd hate to do? But if I did, so what? Who the hell else ever lifted a finger to help you when you were in trouble? When I heard you wanted to get back to being a real surgeon, I took a lot of time to find out if I could help. I can. I'm not asking you for anything. But at least you can consider our relationship friendly, and I assume you would do for me what you'd do for any good friend. That's my string. But you can refuse it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈克尔对她微笑了。“我不见怪。”他又回头对裘里斯说：“你刚才的话实在是一声闷雷。考利昂家族曾经为你牵过线，你以为硬要你做些你不愿意做的事情吗？话又说回来，就算我牵着线，那又怎么样？当你处在困难中的时候，究竟还有谁愿意用屈指之劳来帮帮你的忙？当我听说你想要回头当个名副其实的外科医生时，我为了探索是否可以在哪些方面帮帮忙下了很大的功夫。我发现我能帮忙，我并不向你要任何报偿。不过，你至少可以以朋友的态度考虑咱们之间的关系。而我个人认为，凡是你乐意为一个朋友做的事情，你也会乐意为我做。这就是我所牵的线。不过，你也有拒绝的自由。”">查看中文翻译</div>

Your money goes up too, but you can discuss that with Tom at a later time. And Lucy, I want you to do something more important. Maybe coordinate all the shops that will be opening up in the hotel arcades. On the financial side. Or maybe hiring the girls we need to work in the casinos. something like that.

<div class="line_cn" title="迈克尔点点头，说：“好，在医院营业之前，你就暂时当四个旅社的医务主任。你自己物色一套工作人员，你的收入也会提高，这个问题你找个时间同汤姆讨论讨论。璐西呀，我想要你承担更重的任务。在旅社拱廊里要开设许多小商店，你今后的任务可能就是协调这些商店，主要是财务方面。说不定还要许多姑娘，咱们需要姑娘在赌场里工作，或者类似的其他方面工作。这样，要是裘里斯不娶你，你也可以当个有钱的未婚老姑娘。”">查看中文翻译</div>
