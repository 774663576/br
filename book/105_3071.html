<div class="line_en">He wished he had now, though. The air around them was full of howling. They were out of sight still, but they were there. The light was different, too. A thick layer of cloud hovered over them, and because of it the daylight would be much shorter. He supposed that was only to be expected. It was too much to hope the woman would retain her calm, contented frame of mind. Not when she knew she was dead.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但他现在后悔了。周围的空气中充斥着号叫声，此刻虽然还看不见它们，但它们一定就在附近。光线也变了，一层厚厚的乌云飘浮在他们头顶，因此白昼会比平时还要短一些，他想这是难免的。要期望这个女人还能保持镇定从容、心满意足的心态太不现实了，自从她知道自己的死讯，这就不可能了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She hadn't said much about it. There had been tears, but quiet ones. As if she hadn't wanted to bother him. Another thing to be grateful for. This soul really had made things as easy as possible for him. He felt bad that he had been so cold, so aloof towards her. But it had been the only way he could keep going. They would not even have made it this far otherwise.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对于自己的死，她没多说什么。她也曾流下眼泪，但只是默默地哭泣，好像她不愿意打扰崔斯坦似的。又是一件值得庆幸的事，这个灵魂的确让他的工作变得非常轻松。他一直对她冷若冰霜、敬而远之，他自己心里也觉得不是滋味。但这是能让他继续撑下去的唯一办法了，否则，现在他们不可能走这么远。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tristan made a face as he looked back towards the woman, then up at the darkening sky. They had taken a long time to cross the mudflats. Too long. There wasn't much light left and they still had the full length of the valley to travel across. It wasn't her fault; she'd found it hard, wading through the thick mud, weaving a path around the high grasses. She'd needed help, but Tristan hadn't wanted to touch her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="崔斯坦回头看着那个女人，面带愁容，然后抬头看了看昏暗的天空。他们花了很长时间穿越泥滩，以至于虽然天色已经昏暗，他们仍有整整一条峡谷要穿越。但这不是她的错，要从黏稠的淤泥上跋涉过去，还要绕过高高的野草迂回行进，这些实在是太难为她了。她需要帮助，只是崔斯坦不愿意碰她。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Tristan grimaced. Stupidly, he'd given Marie the same name. He had been too suffocated by grief to come up with a new one and it suited the form he seemed stuck in. He hated it, though. Every time she said it, he heard Dylan's voice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="崔斯坦苦笑了一下。神情恍惚的他告诉玛丽的还是自己在上一个任务中的名字。他悲痛欲绝，实在想不出一个新名字来，而且这个名字也符合他现在的形象，但他恨这个名字。每次她说到这个名字的时候，他都会听到迪伦的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Please, Marie," Tristan winced. He hated using her name. "We need to move."</div>

<div class="line_en">She started to walk forward with more purpose this time, but one glance at the long shadows pooling ominously in front of them told Tristan it wasn't enough.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她开始向前走，这一次她的步伐显得更坚定。但就在他们的前方，长长的黑影正越聚越多，来者不善。崔斯坦只看了一眼，就清楚再坚定也是不够的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He sighed, gritted his teeth. "Come on," he said, gripping her elbow as he pushed past, forcing her to go faster until she broke into a choppy jog. He jogged too, and because it was easier, he dropped her elbow to reach down and grab her hand, pulling her along. The howling intensified and the air stirred as the wraiths started to descend, freed by the encroaching dark, the thickening shadows. The woman heard the change and her fingers squeezed Tristan's more tightly. He could feel her fear, her total reliance on him. Each breath was punctuated by a tiny sob that pierced through his shoulder blades into his chest. It was painful. He had to fight the urge to drop her hand and run, although not from the wraiths; from her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他叹了口气，咬了咬牙，“跟我来。” 说着，他抓住了她的胳膊向前走，带着她越走越快，到后来几乎是深一脚浅一脚地慢跑起来。他也在慢跑，为了更省力，他干脆放下她的胳膊，直接抓起了她的手，拽着她往前跑。号叫声越来越响亮，恶魔们开始向下飞落，搅动得空气也震荡起来。那个女人听到了这些变化，她把崔斯坦攥得更紧了。他能够感受到她的恐惧，还有她对自己百分百的信赖。她的每一次呼吸都会伴随轻轻的啜泣，哭声穿透了他的肩胛骨，直刺入他的胸中。这种感觉太痛苦了，他真想放开她的手，从她身边跑开—尽管不是想把她丢给恶魔不管—他只能努力克制自己的冲动。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She'd seen him from across the valley. An orb, much brighter than all the rest. It had caught her eye, drawn her attention like a moth to a flame. As she'd focused on it, strange things had happened. The riotous red of the barren landscape, the deep burgundies and purples of dusk, had flickered, the colour zapping in and out like a badly tuned television. Blood red turned to the muted greens and browns and dull mauves of her Scottish wasteland.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她看到了他穿越山谷。一个格外耀眼的光球，如同火焰吸引飞蛾一样吸引了迪伦的注意。待到她凝神细看时，怪事出现了。这片荒原那极度绚烂的红色，连同黄昏宛如勃艮第红酒般的深紫色都变得闪烁不定，忽隐忽现，颜色频繁转换着，好像信号很差的电视。血红色转成柔和的绿色、棕色和淡紫色，那是她的苏格兰荒原的色调。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dylan had rocketed out of the chair, thrown herself forward to the door, toes nibbling at the threshold. The wraiths had screamed in anticipation, but she'd stopped just short, staring out.</div>

<div class="line_en">Tristan. She could see him. Him. Not as a pulsing ball of light, but a person, a body, a face. Dylan smiled, gulping in air as if she hadn't breathed since… since he'd left her. He was running, pulling at something as the picture cleared. The landscape stopped flickering, and solidified into the heather-clad wilderness she'd known before. The other souls disappeared, the wraiths dimming to shadows. Only their hissing and crowing stopped her running out to meet him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="崔斯坦，她看得到他。是他，不是闪烁的光球，而是有身体、有面容的活生生的人。迪伦笑了，大口吸气，好像自从他离开之后自己就没有再呼吸过。他在飞跑，随着画面逐渐清晰，她终于看到了他手上拽着什么东西。眼前的景色停止了摇曳闪烁，固定成了她之前熟悉的覆盖着石楠的荒野。其他灵魂消失不见了，恶魔模糊成了一道道阴影。要不是它们发出的嘶嘶声和呼叫声，她就要跑出去迎接他了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As she watched, she realised he was towing another soul. She couldn't see who it was. They were distorted, not quite as transparent as the other souls she'd seen, but still not quite real. Half in, half out. A woman. She was running too. Dylan felt a stab of jealousy when she saw they were holding hands.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她看着看着才发觉他正拉着另一个灵魂。看不清那是谁，那个形象看起来扭曲变形，不像之前见过的那些灵魂一样透明，但还是看不真切，似有还无。是一个女人，她也在奔跑。看到他们手拉着手时，迪伦感到一阵醋意袭来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That's when she'd shouted out, shouted his name. She'd had to do it one, two, three times to be sure he'd heard her, but at last he'd looked up towards the safe house. She'd waved energetically, delighted and frantic -- because Tristan and the soul were cutting it close, just as she had done -- and he'd seen her. She'd seen it in his face. Shock. Horror. Joy. All at the same time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在那时她开始大喊崔斯坦的名字。她必须要一而再、再而三地喊，确保他能听到自己的声音。最后他真的抬头向安全屋张望了，她欣喜若狂地奋力挥手，他也看见了她。迪伦看到了他的表情—惊愕、恐惧，还有欢喜，三种表情交织在一起。">查看中文翻译</div>

It was more horrific, more solid, more real than watching the soul being taken into the depths of the lake.</div>

<div class="line_en">Guilt tumbled over, crushing her with its weight. She'd killed the woman. Whoever she was, Dylan had killed her. Did she have a husband? Children? Had she counted on seeing them again? A flash of Eliza, waiting endlessly for someone who was never going to come, screamed in her brain. All because she had shouted out. She clapped her hand over her mouth to stop herself calling for him again. It was too late though, the damage was done. The woman was dead.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她内心涌动着强烈的负罪感，这沉重的内疚之情简直要把她压垮了。是她害死了那个女人，不管她是谁，都是迪伦害死了她。她有丈夫吗？有小孩吗？她之前是不是还指望着跟他们重逢呢？她脑海中猛然闪现出伊莱扎的画面，迪伦仿佛看到她无休无止等待的身影，等着那个永远也无法到来的丈夫。这一切都是因为她刚才的大喊大叫，她用手捂住嘴不让自己再喊他。但大错已然铸成，现在做什么都太晚了，那个女人已经死了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They grabbed the woman's hair, her arms, attacked her torso, all in the blink of an eye. Tristan turned almost at once, saw what was happening, and Dylan watched as he tried to save her. He reached up, seemed to be trying to pull at the air, but nothing happened; the demons continued their assault on the woman. Astonishment flickered across Tristan's face, but a heartbeat later a determined scowl had wiped it out. He waded in, hauling wraith after wraith off her, but they simply circled back and came again from another angle. Dylan stood in the doorway, her hand reaching out in sympathy, and gazed as the soul was dragged down beneath the surface.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="它们抓着那女人的头发和双臂，对她的身体发动袭击，所有这一切都在转瞬间进行。崔斯坦马上转回头，正好看到了这一幕。他伸手想要使劲把她拉回来，然而已然徒劳无功。恶魔们继续攻击这个女人。崔斯坦一脸错愕，但一秒钟后这副表情就被一脸决绝的怒容取代了。他奋起还击，一个接一个地把恶魔从她身上拽下来，但是它们马上又会从另一个方向迂回过来。迪伦站在门口，眼睁睁地看着这个女人的灵魂被拖入湖中。">查看中文翻译</div>

Without realising it, Dylan threw herself from the doorway and was pounding down the path before her brain caught up with her actions. It was very dark now.

<div class="line_cn" title="“怎么了？”迪伦困惑地看着他。难道他看见自己不高兴？他看似冰冷实则炽热的眼神告诉她绝不是这样。这双眼在注视她的时候闪烁着光芒。那种光芒不是光线造成的幻觉，看上去有些让人害怕。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She could see that now. The words he had said had been nothing more than lies to get her safely across. He hadn't meant any of it. She thought of the soul he'd just been ferrying, the woman she'd accidentally killed with nothing more than her own stupidity; thought about the way they'd been holding hands as they'd run from danger. Had she swallowed Tristan's lies as easily as Dylan had? Her gaze burning into the ground, she suddenly felt incredibly childish.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Dylan." Tristan said her name again, but much more gently. The change in his tone gave her just enough courage to look up. He'd stopped pacing, was scrutinising her with much softer eyes. Embarrassed, she scrubbed at her cheeks, sniffed back the tears that still lingered.

He smiled when she told him about her visit to see Jonas, although his eyes darkened when she confessed that it had been the Nazi soldier who had taken her to Eliza and helped her open the door back to the wasteland.

<div class="line_en">She walked maybe a hundred metres when she realised there was no crunch of gravel echoing her own footsteps. He saw her stop, head half-cocked, listening for him. After a second she whirled around. Alarm widened her eyes before she caught him, right where she'd left him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她大概走了一百米，这才意识到身后没有踩在砂石路上的咯吱声应和自己的脚步。崔斯坦看到她停了下来，半歪着头，听着他的动静。一秒钟后她完全转过头来，她警觉地睁大了眼，然后就看到他还站在刚才她出发的地方。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He just hoped it would not end with a quill delicately erasing her name from a page in his book.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他只是希望，这一切不要随着鹅毛笔潇洒一挥、把她的名字从自己的名册中一笔勾销而结束。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Come on," she called, smiling encouragingly.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“试一下。”迪伦鼓励着他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Let's go," Dylan said, striding down the path away from him. The valley looked wide and inviting, bathed in early morning light, but Tristan lingered in the doorway, watching her go.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们走吧。”迪伦说着，迈着大步上了路。此时沐浴在晨光中的山谷看起来既宽阔又富有魅力，然而崔斯坦只是站在门口，目送着她渐行渐远。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tristan sighed, aggravated. He had promised her he would try. Closing his eyes for a moment, he concentrated on his feet. Move, he thought. He expected nothing to happen; expected to remain glued to the ground, an unyielding pressure holding him in place.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="崔斯坦叹息一声，心情愈加沉重。他已经答应了迪伦自己会试一试的。他的眼睛闭上了片刻，把全部的注意力放到自己的脚上，心中暗想“走”。他本以为什么也不会发生，本以为自己会牢牢定在地上动弹不得，会有一股非常强大的压力把他留在原地。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Good." Feeling daring, Dylan wound her fingers around his. She started walking, and after a gentle tug, Tristan followed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好极了。”迪伦现在感觉自己勇敢极了，她用手指勾住他的手指，开始继续赶路。崔斯坦被她温柔的手牵着跟在后面。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Instantly Tristan halted. He hardly dared breath, waiting for a bolt of lightning, a slash of pain. Something to punish him for daring to disobey his unspoken orders. Nothing happened. Incredulous and suspicious, he continued down towards Dylan.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="崔斯坦赶紧停住脚步。他几乎不敢呼吸，等待着天空中飞来一道闪电，等待着那一击之下的剧痛，这是对他胆敢违抗无言的天命的惩罚。然而什么也没发生。他觉得不可思议，在满腹狐疑中继续朝迪伦走过来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"This feels weird," he confessed in a low voice once he'd all but reached her side. "I keep waiting for something to stop me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“感觉太蹊跷了。”他在快到迪伦跟前时低声说，“我一直等着有什么东西会来阻止我。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The valley gave them no difficulties. In fact, it was nice. They could have been any young couple, striding hand in hand through the countryside. There was no sight or sound of the wraiths. It unsettled Dylan to know they were there, hovering at her shoulder, hoping she'd lose focus, look away from her orb. She wanted to ask Tristan what he saw; whether it was the lush grass and heather-covered hills that she could see, or the wasteland as it truly was. But something held her tongue. She was nervous that, if she talked about it, if she drew attention to it, the mirage would disintegrate and they'd be back under the burning red sun. That landscape, she knew, would be much harder to traverse. No -- ignorance was bliss.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山谷没有给他们制造任何麻烦。实际上这里风景很好，他们看上去就像任何一对手牵手漫步乡间的年轻情侣一样。此时既看不到恶魔的身影，也听不到它们的叫嚣。那些家伙就在那儿，在她的肩头盘旋。它们就盼着她放松注意力，不看她的摆渡人。一想到这些，迪伦就烦躁不安。她很想问问崔斯坦看到了什么，不管那是自己眼中的茂盛野草、石楠覆盖的山峦，还是荒原的本来模样。但不知为何她始终张不开口，她很紧张，生怕自己一旦说起了那些事，一旦她把注意力转移到这个上面，眼下所有的奇妙幻象就会土崩瓦解，他们又会回到烈日的炙烤中。她知道，穿越那片荒原要困难得多。算了—无知便是福。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Beside her Tristan sighed dramatically. She looked at him, confused at the sound, and saw his eyes were amused. He flashed her an indulgent smirk.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她身旁的崔斯坦夸张地长叹了一声。她看看他，先是被这声音弄糊涂了，然后才发现他的眼中闪着一丝狡黠。他冲着她傻乐，一副迁就纵容的模样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You're wonderful," she told him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你真是太好了。”她告诉他了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Beyond the valley lay the wide expanse of marsh. The clement weather had done nothing to soak up the stagnant pools of water or dry out the squelching mud. Dylan eyed it distastefully. It smelled, and she remembered the way it had grasped at her ankles, imprisoning her. After the tranquillity of the valley, it was a stark reminder that she was in the wasteland, that danger still hung around her neck.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山谷外是一片开阔的沼泽湿地。和煦的天气丝毫不能吸干湿地中的水分，也无法晒干踩上去咯吱作响的淤泥。迪伦厌恶地看了看这片泥潭。这里臭气熏天，迪伦想起之前她的脚踝在这里被牢牢吸住，动弹不得的情景。在走过宁静的山谷后，此地提醒着她一个严酷的事实—她仍身处荒原，随时都有丧命的危险。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Piggyback?" he suggested.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“要我背你吗？”他建议道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Thanks," she murmured into his ear when he had her in position.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“谢了。”等他把她背好时，她在他耳边轻轻说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He rolled his eyes, but turned so that she could scramble up onto his back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他白了她一眼，但还是转过身，好让她能爬到自己的背上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Uh-huh," he replied sourly, but she could see his cheeks lift in a smile.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他似乎很愠怒地哼了一声，但迪伦能看到他脸上的笑意。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She felt heavy on his back, her arms soon tiring of holding her in position, but Tristan didn't complain, picking his way through the worst of the mud. Even with her extra weight, he didn't seem to sink into the sludgy mire. Soon the marsh was no more than a distant memory and Dylan's gaze was filled with the sheer slant of a giant hill, waiting patiently for her. She wrinkled her nose and huffed, disgruntled; she doubted she was going to able to convince Tristan to carry her up that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一直保持一个姿势，没过多久他的胳膊就酸了。她背起来沉甸甸的，但他并没有抱怨，在一摊烂泥里择路而行。哪怕背上加了额外的重量，他看上去也根本不会陷进泥泞的沼泽中。没多久这片湿地就被他们远远甩在身后，而迪伦的注意力也早已被眼前一座巍峨高山的陡坡吸引住。她皱了一下鼻子，恨恨地呼出一口气。她觉得自己很可能没办法说动崔斯坦把自己背上山。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dylan didn't want to admit to her schemes. Instead she asked something that had been quietly preying on her mind.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你在想什么呢？”他问道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She'd told every piece of her story last night, but she'd purposely avoided asking this. She hadn't wanted to bring up what he'd done; how he'd tricked her. Betrayed her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她昨天晚上把自己的所有经历都和盘托出了，但是她故意避开了这个问题。她不愿意重新提到他当初的所作所为—他是如何欺骗自己、背叛自己的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dylan sniffed quietly, determined not to get upset. She didn't want him to feel guilty, didn't want him to know how much that had hurt. At least he hadn't been there to see her break down, she thought.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦轻轻吸了一口气，决心不让自己难过。她不想让他感到内疚，不想让他知道这对他的伤害有多大。她想，至少他当时没有看到自己精神崩溃的样子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It's okay," she whispered, squeezing his shoulders.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“还好啦。”她低声说，抓紧了他的肩膀。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's not," he disagreed. "I lied to you, and I'm sorry. But I thought… I thought that was the right thing for you." The final few words were stilted and despite herself, Dylan felt her throat tightening. "When I saw you crying, when I heard you screaming for me…" His voice faltered. "It hurt more than anything the wraiths could ever have done to me."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦的声音非常微弱，“当时你还能看见我吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He nodded. "Just for a minute or so." He gave a short, sour laugh. "Usually that's my favourite part. A whole minute where I am responsible for no one but me. And I get to see a quick glimpse of beyond. Just a flash. Wherever it is that the soul called home."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他点点头，“只有一分钟左右，”他露出一丝苦笑，“以前我最喜欢的就是这个时候。完完整整的一分钟时间里，除了自己我不用对任何人负责。在那一瞬间，我还能瞥见远方，那个灵魂称之为家的地方。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dylan stiffened on his back. She remembered Jonas saying the same thing. That he'd instantly been transported back home, back to Stuttgart.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦在他背上身体发僵。她想起来乔纳斯曾经说起过同样的事，他一瞬间就回到了家，回到了斯图加特。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“但这样的事没发生在我身上，”她缓缓地说，“我还是没有离开荒原。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She counted three of Tristan's long, confident strides before he answered her. "I don't know," he mumbled, but his words lacked the ring of truth.</div>

<div class="line_en">Tristan let her down as soon as the ground began to firm up beneath his feet. At first Dylan pouted, missing the warmth of being nestled up close to him -- and the luxury of being carried -- but he took her hand again and smiled down at her. She returned the gesture, but the smile fell from her face as she eyed the steep incline before them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="脚下的地开始变硬了，崔斯坦马上就把她放了下来。开始迪伦还有些愠怒—因为不舍依偎在他身上时的那股暖意，还有被他背着的奢侈享受。崔斯坦重又拉起她的手，低头对着她微笑。她也对他报以微笑，然而她一看到前方陡峭的山坡，笑容马上就消失了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Trudge, trudge, trudge. Up, up, up. Dylan's calves were soon burning, her breathing was laboured. The higher they climbed, the more the wind crept up and as the afternoon waned, thick tufts of grey began to form above their heads. Despite the chill of the changing weather, Dylan was sweating and she had to yank her hand from Tristan's grasp, embarrassed at her moist palms. Even though the morning had been warm and bright, dew still loitered beneath the thick grasses and heathers that blanketed the floor, and she felt the familiar creeping discomfort as cold water seeped up the legs of her jeans.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="跋涉，跋涉，再跋涉；向上，向上，不断向上。迪伦的小腿肚子很快就变得酸胀，呼吸也很吃力。他们攀得越高，风势也越来越猛。随着午后时光慢慢流逝，一簇簇浓密的乌云开始在天空聚集。尽管天气变换、寒意袭人，但迪伦还在出汗，手心都湿乎乎的。她有些尴尬，只好把手从崔斯坦那儿抽出来。虽然整个早上一直温暖、阳光明媚，然而露水依然顺着漫山遍野的野草和石楠缓缓往下淌。冷水浸透了她的牛仔裤，曾经熟悉的那种越来越不舒服的感觉又回来了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No." Tristan's reply was curt, terse, but when Dylan looked round at him, surprised, she saw he was eyeing the sky, not her. His face was screwed up with unease, his lips turned down unhappily. "It'll be evening soon. I don't want you stuck out here."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不行。”崔斯坦的回答直截了当。但当迪伦打量他时，却诧异地看到他的眼睛没有看她，而是盯着天空。由于不安，他的脸紧拧着，嘴不快地向下撇，“就快到傍晚了，我不想你停在这么显眼的地方。”">查看中文翻译</div>
