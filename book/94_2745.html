<div class="line_en">Elsa pulls the Gryffindor scarf tighter around her face, pushes her hands into her pockets, and leads them through the snow. The wurse is so delighted about escaping the bus that it skips in circles around Elsa and The Monster like an overexcited puppy. The Monster looks disgusted. He doesn't seem used to being outdoors by daylight, Elsa notices. Maybe it's because Wolfheart is used to living in the dark forests outside Miamas where the daylight doesn't dare penetrate. At least, that is where he lives in Granny's fairy tales, so if there is any sort of order to this story, this must surely be the logical explanation.</div>

But when all the other people at the bus stop start eyeing The Monster and the wurse and nervously shuffling as far away from them as it's possible to be without ending up at the next bus stop, she realizes it's not going to be quite so straightforward.</div>

Exactly one stop later.</div>

<div class="line_en">People who see them on the pavement react as people generally do when they catch sight of a girl, a wurse, and a monster strolling along side by side: they cross the street. Some of them try to pretend that it has nothing to do with the fact that they are scared of monsters and wurses and girls, by demonstratively pretending to be having loud telephone conversations with someone who suddenly gives them different directions and tells them to go the opposite way. That is also what Elsa's dad does sometimes when he's gone the wrong way and he doesn't want strangers to realize he's one of those types who go the wrong way. Elsa's mum never has that problem, because if she goes the wrong way she just keeps going until whoever she was supposed to be meeting has to follow her. Granny used to solve the problem by shouting at the road signs. It varies, how people deal with it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="路上的行人看到一个女孩、一只呜嘶和一个怪物肩并肩闲逛时的反应，不出所料，他们都跑去了街对面。有些人不愿表现出是因为害怕才这么做的，他们假装大声打电话，然后突然被指去了不同方向，于是走到了街对面。爱莎的爸爸有时也这么做，他走错路却不想让陌生人觉得他是那种会走错路的人。爱莎的妈妈从没有这种困扰，如果她走错了，她就继续走下去，直到她要见的人不得不跟在她后头。外婆解决这问题的方式是冲路牌大声嚷嚷。人们处理事情的方式多种多样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But others who run into the adventuring trio are not as discreet, and they watch Elsa from the other side of the road as if she's being abducted. Elsa feels that The Monster would probably be good at many things, but a kidnapper who can be put out of action by sneezing at him would probably not be a particularly effective kidnapper. It's a curious sort of Achilles' heel for a superhero, she feels. Snot.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但另一些遭遇冒险三人组的人想得就没那么周到了，他们从马路另一边关注着爱莎，怀疑她被诱拐了。爱莎觉得怪物可能擅长许多事情，但是没有诱拐这一项，打个喷嚏就能放倒的诱拐犯应该不是个太成功的诱拐犯。她觉得这大概是超级英雄非常少见的弱点——鼻涕。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It's almost lunchtime by the time they find the right address. Elsa's feet hurt and she's hungry and in a bad mood. She knows that a knight of Miamas would never whine or be afraid of a grand adventure when sent out on a treasure hunt, but whoever said a knight can't be hungry or ill-tempered?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们找到正确地址时，已经快到午饭时间了。爱莎脚痛肚子饿，心情很不好。她知道密阿玛斯的骑士被派去寻宝时，绝不会对伟大的冒险抱怨或害怕，但谁说一位骑士不能饥肠辘辘、脾气暴躁呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There's a high-rise at the address, but also a hamburger restaurant across the street. Elsa tells the wurse and The Monster to wait, and she goes across even though she has firm moral objections to hamburger chains, as every almost-eight-year-old should. But even almost-eight-year-olds can't eat their principles, so she grudgingly buys ice cream for the wurse, a hamburger for The Monster, and a veggie burger for herself. And as she leaves she sneaks out her red felt-tip pen and crosses out the dash between "Lunch" and "menu" on the sign outside.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那个地址上有一栋高楼，街对面是一家汉堡店。爱莎叫呜嘶和怪物等在原地，她自己过了马路。虽然她对汉堡连锁店有着坚定的道德异议，但原则不能当饭吃，所以她不情愿地给呜嘶买了冰激凌，给怪物买了一个汉堡，给自己买了一个素食汉堡。然后她偷偷掏出她的红笔，把“菜”和“单”之间的空格给划掉了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The walk takes more than two hours. Elsa wishes it were Halloween, because then they could take the bus without scaring normal people, everyone would just assume they were dressed up. That's why Elsa likes Halloween: on Halloween it's normal to be different.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这段路要走两个多小时。爱莎希望今天是万圣节，那样他们就能乘坐公交车，而不至于吓到普通人，别人只会觉得他们是故意装扮成这样的。这也是爱莎喜欢万圣节的原因：在万圣节，与众不同是一件很正常的事。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Despite the below-freezing temperature clawing at their faces, they sit on a bench opposite the high-rise building. Or rather, Elsa and the wurse sit, because The Monster looks at the bench as if it's also about to lick him. He refuses to even touch the greaseproof paper around his hamburger, so the wurse eats that as well. At one point the wurse drops a bit of ice cream on the bench and licks it up without concern, and The Monster looks close to asphyxiation. After the wurse takes a bite of Elsa's burger and she carries on eating it regardless, she has to help him breathe from a paper bag.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尽管低于零度的气温刺痛着他们的脸，他们还是坐在了高楼对面的室外长椅上。或者说，爱莎和呜嘶坐着，而怪物看着那张长椅的样子就好像它也想舔他。他连汉堡外的防油纸都不肯碰，所以呜嘶吃了他的汉堡。吃冰激凌的时候，呜嘶滴了一滴在长椅上，然后毫不犹豫地舔掉了。呜嘶又咬了一口爱莎的汉堡，而爱莎不假思索地把剩下的吃完。看到这一幕，怪物已经呼吸过度到快要窒息了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When they're finally done, Elsa leans her head back and looks up the façade of the building. It must be fifteen floors high. She takes the envelope from her pocket, slides off the bench, and marches inside. The Monster and the wurse follow her in silence, surrounded by a strong smell of alcogel. Elsa quickly scans the board of residents on the wall and finds the name as written on the envelope, though preceded by the words "Reg. Psychotherapist." Elsa doesn't know what that means, but she's heard a good deal about terropists setting off bombs and causing all sorts of trouble, so a psychoterropist must be even worse.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="终于吃完午饭，爱莎向后靠着，抬头仰望那栋建筑的外观。它一定有十五层楼那么高。她从口袋里拿出信封，滑下长椅，大步走了进去。怪物和呜嘶默默地跟着她，身边围绕着一股强烈的酒精气味。爱莎快速地浏览了一下墙上的入驻名牌，找到了信封上的名字，名字旁边写着“注册心理治疗师”。爱莎不知道那是什么意思，但她听说过许多放置炸弹、制造各种各样麻烦的恐怖分子，所以一名“心理恐怖分子”[1]一定更糟糕。【注：[1]心理治疗师的英文是psychotherapist，恐怖分子是terrorist，爱莎把恐怖分子记成了“terropist”，所以她以为心理治疗师是“psycho—terropist”，字面上直译就是“心理恐怖分子”。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Elsa evaluates The Monster as they're going up. His beard sticks out of the hood like a large, curious squirrel, which makes him seem less and less dangerous the longer she knows him. The Monster clearly takes note of her examination of him, and he twists his hands uncomfortably. To her own surprise, Elsa realizes that his attitude hurts her feelings.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="上楼时，爱莎对怪物进行了一番评估。他的胡子从兜帽里伸出来，让他看着像只奇怪的巨大松鼠，但也让他显得不那么危险了。怪物显然注意到了她的检视，不自在地扭着自己的双手。没料到的是，他的态度居然让爱莎感觉受了伤害。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She heads over to the lift at the other end of the corridor. The wurse stops when they get there, and refuses to take another step. Elsa shrugs and goes in. The Monster follows her, after a certain amount of hesitation, though he is careful not to touch any of the walls.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她向着走廊另一头的电梯走去。到达电梯门前，呜嘶停下了，不肯再往前走一步。爱莎耸耸肩，进了电梯。怪物犹豫了好一会儿也跟着她进去了，小心翼翼地不去碰任何一面电梯壁。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Anyway, you don't have to be right beside me the whole time to be able to guard me," she says, sounding more resentful than she means to.

<div class="line_en">When the elevator doors glide open Elsa marches out ahead of him. They pass rows of doors until they find the terropist's door. Elsa knocks so hard she actually hurts her knuckles. The Monster backs off towards the wall on the other side of the narrow corridor, as if he realizes that the person on the other side of the door may peer through the spyhole. He seems to be trying to make himself as small and unfrightening as possible. It's hard not to find this endearing, thinks Elsa -- even if "unfrightening" is not a proper word.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="电梯门开了，爱莎抢在他前面走了出去。他们走过一排门，找到了“恐怖分子”的门。爱莎使出很大力气敲门，敲得指关节都疼了。怪物退到狭长走廊的另一面墙边，像是担心门后的人会从猫眼里偷窥。他大概想尽量让自己看起来又小又不令人恐惧。爱莎心想这样的举动很难不招人喜欢——哪怕“不令人恐惧”严格意义上来说不是个词语。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Elsa knocks on the door again. Puts her ear against the lock. Another knock. Another silence.</div>

<div class="line_en">As far as Elsa is concerned, the silence goes from pleasant to hard work to unbearable in about one and a half eternities. And when she has occupied herself with everything she has been able to come up with -- drumming her fingers against the tabletop, poking out all the stuffing from the chair cushion through a little hole in the fabric, and carving her name into the soft wood of the armrest with the nail of her index finger -- she shatters the silence with one of those questions that sound much more accusing than she means it to be.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就爱莎而言，安静从令人愉快，到勉强还行，到无法忍受，大概是“一个半永恒”的时间。当她已经忙完所有她能想到的事情：在桌面上敲手指；从一个小洞里抠出椅子坐垫的填充物；在软木扶手上用食指指甲刻上她的名字。然后，她用一个比自己想象中听上去更像指责的问题打破了沉默。">查看中文翻译</div>
