<div class="line_en">Now she was being escorted to the hospital. As she approached the entrance, she saw reporters clotted out front. Someone in the crowd must have recognized her, because they turned in unison, like some suddenly roused beast, and pushed forward.</div>

<div class="line_en">For sixteen hours, Kate rode an emotional pendulum that swung between hope and despair. At first she'd focused on details -- calling her parents, packing Marah's things, filling out paperwork. The busy-work had been a lifesaver; without it, there was nothing to do but worry. On the flight, she'd taken sleeping pills for the first time in her life, and though her sleep had been oozy, black, and restless, it was infinitely better than being awake.</div>

<div class="line_en">He looked frail and broken, like a child in his parents' bed.

<div class="line_en">They were the words Kate needed to hear. She had a job here; the time for feeling too much and falling apart would come later when she was alone. "Thank you," she said to the nurse, and walked toward the bed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这就是凯蒂需要听到的话。她身负重责大任，此时此地不适合感情用事、哭泣崩溃，等她一个人的时候再慢慢发泄。“谢谢。”她对护士说，走向了病床。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"This was not our deal," she said. "I distinctly remember that you promised to be okay. So, I'm going to assume you'll honor that." She wiped her eyes and leaned down to kiss his swollen cheek. "Mom and Dad send their prayers. Marah is with them right now. And Tully is flying over to be with us; you know how pissed she'll be if you don't give her your full attention. You might as well wake up now before she badgers you to death." She tripped over the last word, winced, straightening by sheer dint of will. "I didn't mean that," she whispered, gripping the bedrails tightly. "Can you hear me, John Ryan? Let me know you're in there." She reached down, took his hand in hers. "Squeeze my hand, baby. You can do it." Then: "Say something, damn it. I won't even yell at you for scaring the shit out of me. Not right away, anyway."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们不是说好了？”她说，“我记得很清楚，你保证过会平安无事，我还以为你说得出就做得到。”她抹去眼泪，弯腰亲吻他红肿的脸，“爸妈都在为你祈祷，玛拉托给他们照顾。塔莉很快就会过来陪我们，你应该很清楚，要是胆敢不理她，她绝对会大发脾气，所以你最好快点醒过来，不然她会把你骂死。”最后那个字使她哽咽，险些失控，但她凭着意志力重新振作起来。“我说错话了。”她低语，轻轻握住病床栏杆。“强尼·雷恩，你有没有听见？让我知道你在。”她向下握住他的手，“捏我的手，宝贝，你一定能做到。”然后又说，“可恶，快说话呀！虽然你害我吓得半死，但我不会凶你——至少现在不会。”">查看中文翻译</div>

"Everything about this case is uncertain right now, except this: This is a story of heroes, both in the war zone and at home. John Ryan wanted to bring this story to the American people, and I know him well enough to say that he knew the risks he was taking and wouldn't have made another choice. And while he was covering the war, his wife, Kathleen, was at home with their one-year-old daughter, believing that what her husband was doing was important. Like any soldier's wife, it was her sacrifice as much as his that made it possible for John Ryan to do his job." The picture cut back to Tully on the hospital steps.

Kate had never known exactly how it had happened, Tully's inability to apologize, but she suspected that it had something to do with Cloud. There was some bit of her best friend that had been damaged beyond repair as a child, and this, somehow, was the scar. Finally, she reached for the cup, saying, "Thanks."</div>
