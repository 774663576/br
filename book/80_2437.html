<div class="line_en">The partnership at Carolina having succeeded, I was encourag'd to engage in others, and to promote several of my workmen, who had behaved well, by establishing them with printing-houses in different colonies, on the same terms with that in Carolina. Most of them did well, being enabled at the end of our term, six years, to purchase the types of me and go on working for themselves, by which means several families were raised. Partnerships often finish in quarrels; but I was happy in this, that mine were all carried on and ended amicably, owing, I think, a good deal to the precaution of having very explicitly settled, in our articles, every thing to be done by or expected from each partner, so that there was nothing to dispute, which precaution I would therefore recommend to all who enter into partnerships; for, whatever esteem partners may have for, and confidence in each other at the time of the contract, little jealousies and disgusts may arise, with ideas of inequality in the care and burden of the business, etc., which are attended often with breach of friendship and of the connection, perhaps with lawsuits and other disagreeable consequences.</div>

<div class="line_en">With respect to defense, Spain having been several years at war against Great Britain, and being at length join'd by France, which brought us into great danger; and the laboured and long-continued endeavour of our governor, Thomas, to prevail with our Quaker Assembly to pass a militia law, and make other provisions for the security of the province, having proved abortive, I determined to try what might be done by a voluntary association of the people. To promote this, I first wrote and published a pamphlet, entitled PLAIN TRUTH, in which I stated our defenceless situation in strong lights, with the necessity of union and discipline for our defense, and promis'd to propose in a few days an association, to be generally signed for that purpose. The pamphlet had a sudden and surprising effect. I was call'd upon for the instrument of association, and having settled the draft of it with a few friends, I appointed a meeting of the citizens in the large building before mentioned. The house was pretty full; I had prepared a number of printed copies, and provided pens and ink dispers'd all over the room. I harangued them a little on the subject, read the paper, and explained it, and then distributed the copies, which were eagerly signed, not the least objection being made.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="至于关于防务问题，西班牙跟大不列颠已经打了几年仗了，最后法国终于也参加到西班牙一方面去了，这就使我们的处境十分险恶。我们的州长汤麦斯曾经辛勤地不断努力说服在教友会控制下的我们的州议会通过一条民兵法和采取措施保障本州的安全，但是他的努力全然无效。因此我就设法试从人民中间征募义勇军。为了推进这件事，我首先撰写并发表了一本小册子，定名为《平凡的真理》。在这本小册子里我强调指出我们毫无防备的情形，指出为了我们的国防我们必须征集和训练军队，并且约定在几天之内我将提议组织义勇军团队，广泛征求队员来加强国防。这本小册子产生了意想不到令人惊异的效果。有人向我要入队志愿书，我跟几个朋友商订了一个志愿书草样以后，我就在前面提过的大会堂里召集了一个市民会议。会堂里差不多坐满了人。我预先印好了入队志愿书，在会堂各处也预备了笔墨。我向他们讲了一些关于国防的话，读了志愿书的项目并加以解释，以后就把它们发出去，大家踊跃地在志愿书上签了名，连一点异议也没有。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I had, on the whole, abundant reason to be satisfied with my being established in Pennsylvania. There were, however, two things that I regretted, there being no provision for defense, nor for a compleat education of youth; no militia, nor any college. I therefore, in 1743, drew up a proposal for establishing an academy; and at that time, thinking the Reverend Mr. Peters, who was out of employ, a fit person to superintend such an institution, I communicated the project to him; but he, having more profitable views in the service of the proprietaries, which succeeded, declin'd the undertaking; and, not knowing another at that time suitable for such a trust, I let the scheme lie a while dormant. I succeeded better the next year, 1744, in proposing and establishing a Philosophical Society. The paper I wrote for that purpose will be found among my writings, when collected.</div>

<div class="line_en">The officers of the companies composing the Philadelphia regiment, being met, chose me for their colonel; but, conceiving myself unfit, I declin'd that station, and recommended Mr. Lawrence, a fine person, and man of influence, who was accordingly appointed. I then propos'd a lottery to defray the expense of building a battery below the town, and furnishing it with cannon. It filled expeditiously, and the battery was soon erected, the merlons being fram'd of logs and fill'd with earth. We bought some old cannon from Boston, but, these not being sufficient, we wrote to England for more, soliciting, at the same time, our proprietaries for some assistance, tho' without much expectation of obtaining it.</div>

These all furnished themselves as soon as they could with arms, formed themselves into companies and regiments, chose their own officers, and met every week to be instructed in the manual exercise, and other parts of military discipline.

<div class="line_en">My activity in these operations was agreeable to the governor and council; they took me into confidence, and I was consulted by them in every measure wherein their concurrence was thought useful to the association. Calling in the aid of religion, I propos'd to them the proclaiming a fast, to promote reformation, and implore the blessing of Heaven on our undertaking. They embrac'd the motion; but, as it was the first fast ever thought of in the province, the secretary had no precedent from which to draw the proclamation. My education in New England, where a fast is proclaimed every year, was here of some advantage: I drew it in the accustomed stile, it was translated into German, printed in both languages, and divulg'd thro' the province. This gave the clergy of the different sects an opportunity of influencing their congregations to join in the association, and it would probably have been general among all but Quakers if the peace had not soon interven'd.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我在这些方面的活动受到了州长和参事会的欢迎。他们把我当作了知心朋友，他们总问我他们应当采取什么措施，会有益于团练。为了获得宗教的支援，我请他宣布吃斋一日，以求改进军队并祈求上帝祝福我们的事业。他们很欢迎这一建议，但是因为在宾州以前没有举行过斋日，所以秘书找不到前例，不知道应当怎样起草这个文告。在新英格兰这种斋日却是每年宣布的，因此我在那里所受的教育在这里也有点帮助。我就按照传统的格式起了一个草，译成德文，然后用两种文字印了出来，向全州公布。这就给与各教派的牧师一个机会去鼓励他们的会众参加团队。假如不是因为战事很快地结束的话，也许除了教友会以外的各教派都会广泛地参加团队哩。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Meanwhile, Colonel Lawrence, William Allen, Abram Taylor, Esqr., and myself were sent to New York by the associators, commission'd to borrow some cannon of Governor Clinton. He at first refus'd us peremptorily; but at dinner with his council, where there was great drinking of Madeira wine, as the custom of that place then was, he softened by degrees, and said he would lend us six. After a few more bumpers he advanc'd to ten; and at length he very good-naturedly conceded eighteen. They were fine cannon, eighteen-pounders, with their carriages, which we soon transported and mounted on our battery, where the associators kept a nightly guard while the war lasted, and among the rest I regularly took my turn of duty there as a common soldier.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="同时，团队派遣我和罗凌士团长、威廉·阿伦先生、亚布篮·泰罗先生到纽约去向克林吞州长借几尊大炮。他起初坚决地拒绝了我们。当他和他的参事进晚餐时，按照当时当地的习惯，他们喝了大量的白葡萄酒，他的态度就渐渐地软化了，他说他愿意借给我们六尊。接着又满满地喝了几杯以后，他把数目增高到十尊，到了末了他十分温厚地答应让给我们十八尊。他借给我们的倒是质地优良的上等十八磅炮，连同炮架在内。没多时我们把它们运回来装在我们的炮台上。在战争继续期间，团队每夜在炮台上放哨守望，我跟着其他队员像一个普通士兵一样按时轮班值勤。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was thought by some of my friends that, by my activity in these affairs, I should offend that sect, and thereby lose my interest in the Assembly of the province, where they formed a great majority. A young gentleman who had likewise some friends in the House, and wished to succeed me as their clerk, acquainted me that it was decided to displace me at the next election; and he, therefore, in good will, advis'd me to resign, as more consistent with my honour than being turn'd out. My answer to him was, that I had read or heard of some public man who made it a rule never to ask for an office, and never to refuse one when offer'd to him. "I approve," says I, "of his rule, and will practice it with a small addition; I shall never ask, never refuse, nor ever resign an office. If they will have my office of clerk to dispose of to another, they shall take it from me. I will not, by giving it up, lose my right of some time or other making reprisals on my adversaries." I heard, however, no more of this; I was chosen again unanimously as usual at the next election. Possibly, as they dislik'd my late intimacy with the members of council, who had join'd the governors in all the disputes about military preparations, with which the House had long been harass'd, they might have been pleas'd if I would voluntarily have left them; but they did not care to displace me on account merely of my zeal for the association, and they could not well give another reason.</div>

And I found that a much greater number of them than I could have imagined, tho' against offensive war, were clearly for the defensive. Many pamphlets pro and con were publish'd on the subject, and some by good Quakers, in favour of defense, which I believe convinc'd most of their younger people.</div>

<div class="line_en">A transaction in our fire company gave me some insight into their prevailing sentiments. It had been propos'd that we should encourage the scheme for building a battery by laying out the present stock, then about sixty pounds, in tickets of the lottery. By our rules, no money could be dispos'd of till the next meeting after the proposal. The company consisted of thirty members, of which twenty-two were Quakers, and eight only of other persuasions. We eight punctually attended the meeting; but, tho' we thought that some of the Quakers would join us, we were by no means sure of a majority. Only one Quaker, Mr. James Morris, appear'd to oppose the measure. He expressed much sorrow that it had ever been propos'd, as he said Friends were all against it, and it would create such discord as might break up the company. We told him that we saw no reason for that; we were the minority, and if Friends were against the measure, and outvoted us, we must and should, agreeably to the usage of all societies, submit. When the hour for business arriv'd it was mov'd to put the vote; he allow'd we might then do it by the rules, but, as he could assure us that a number of members intended to be present for the purpose of opposing it, it would be but candid to allow a little time for their appearing.</div>

<div class="line_en">While we were disputing this, a waiter came to tell me two gentlemen below desir'd to speak with me. I went down, and found they were two of our Quaker members. They told me there were eight of them assembled at a tavern just by; that they were determin'd to come and vote with us if there should be occasion, which they hop'd would not be the case, and desir'd we would not call for their assistance if we could do without it, as their voting for such a measure might embroil them with their elders and friends. Being thus secure of a majority, I went up, and after a little seeming hesitation, agreed to a delay of another hour. This Mr. Morris allow'd to be extreamly fair. Not one of his opposing friends appear'd, at which he express'd great surprize; and, at the expiration of the hour, we carry'd the resolution eight to one; and as, of the twenty-two Quakers, eight were ready to vote with us, and thirteen, by their absence, manifested that they were not inclin'd to oppose the measure, I afterward estimated the proportion of Quakers sincerely against defense as one to twenty-one only; for these were all regular members of that society, and in good reputation among them, and had due notice of what was propos'd at that meeting.</div>

He put into my hands sixty pounds to be laid out in lottery tickets for the battery, with directions to apply what prizes might be drawn wholly to that service. He told me the following anecdote of his old master, William Penn, respecting defense. He came over from England, when a young man, with that proprietary, and as his secretary. It was war-time, and their ship was chas'd by an armed vessel, suppos'd to be an enemy. Their captain prepar'd for defense; but told William Penn and his company of Quakers, that he did not expect their assistance, and they might retire into the cabin, which they did, except James Logan, who chose to stay upon deck, and was quarter'd to a gun. The suppos'd enemy prov'd a friend, so there was no fighting; but when the secretary went down to communicate the intelligence, William Penn rebuk'd him severely for staying upon deck, and undertaking to assist in defending the vessel, contrary to the principles of Friends, especially as it had not been required by the captain. This reproof, being before all the company, piqu'd the secretary, who answer'd, "I being thy servant, why did thee not order me to come down?

<div class="line_en">My being many years in the Assembly, the majority of which were constantly Quakers, gave me frequent opportunities of seeing the embarrassment given them by their principle against war, whenever application was made to them, by order of the crown, to grant aids for military purposes. They were unwilling to offend government, on the one hand, by a direct refusal; and their friends, the body of the Quakers, on the other, by a compliance contrary to their principles; hence a variety of evasions to avoid complying, and modes of disguising the compliance when it became unavoidable. The common mode at last was, to grant money under the phrase of its being "for the king's use," and never to inquire how it was applied.</div>

<div class="line_en">But, if the demand was not directly from the crown, that phrase was found not so proper, and some other was to be invented. As, when powder was wanting (I think it was for the garrison at Louisburg), and the government of New England solicited a grant of some from Pennsilvania, which was much urg'd on the House by Governor Thomas, they could not grant money to buy powder, because that was an ingredient of war; but they voted an aid to New England of three thousand pounds, to he put into the hands of the governor, and appropriated it for the purchasing of bread, flour, wheat, or other grain. Some of the council, desirous of giving the House still further embarrassment, advis'd the governor not to accept provision, as not being the thing he had demanded; but be reply'd, "I shall take the money, for I understand very well their meaning; other grain is gunpowder," which he accordingly bought, and they never objected to it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是假如请求拨款的命令不是直接从国王来的，这句话就不大适用了，他们就得另外想出一些花样来。比方说，新英格兰的政府因缺乏火药（我想是为了防守路易堡）请求宾夕法尼亚拨给一些火药，汤麦斯州长极力主张州议会应当加以援助，而州议会又无法给钱购买火药，因为火药是战争的要素，但是他们通过拨款三千镑援助新英格兰，款项交由州长掌握，作为购买粮食、面粉或其他粒状物之用。有些参事想给州议会更多的麻烦，劝州长不要接受这笔款项，因为它不符合他的要求，但是他回答说：“我接受这笔钱，因为我很了解它的意义。所谓其他粒状物就是火药。”因此他购买了火药，他们从不反对此事。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was in allusion to this fact that, when in our fire company we feared the success of our proposal in favour of the lottery, and I had said to my friend Mr. Syng, one of our members, "If we fail, let us move the purchase of a fire-engine with the money; the Quakers can have no objection to that; and then, if you nominate me and I you as a committee for that purpose, we will buy a great gun, which is certainly a fire-engine." "I see," says he, "you have improv'd by being so long in the Assembly; your equivocal project would be just a match for their wheat or other grain."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在我们的消防队里，当我们害怕我们购买奖券的议案通不过时，我就想到这件事，我对我的朋友沈先生（我们的一个队员）说：“假如我们的提议通不过，让我们提议用这笔钱来购买一架救火机，教友会教友不会反对这件事，接着你就提我的名，我提你的名，我们两人组成委员会购买机器，我们就买一尊火炮，这当然是一架火机呀。”此处原文是“fire—engine”，意即“救火机”，但如果照字面解释，也可说是一架“火机”。富兰克林这里利用了这一双关语。——译者注他说：“原来你在州议会里呆了那么久，你也有了进步了。你这双关的计划简直可与他们的‘粮食或其他粒状物’先后媲美了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
