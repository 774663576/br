<div class="line_en">Athena Aquitane had earned her way to stardom in the traditional way that the public seldom appreciates. She spent long years in training: acting classes, dance and movement classes, voice lessons, extensive reading in dramatic literature, all necessary to the art of acting.</div>

<div class="line_en">None of this had been painful or humiliating to her, not even when the buyer of a Rolls-Royce assumed she came with the car. She had put him off with the joke that she had the same price as the car. She was fond of men, she enjoyed sex, but only as a treat and reward for more serious endeavor. Men were not a serious part of her world.</div>

<div class="line_en">In her first year she earned her living by doing commercials, and some modeling, as a skimpily clad hostess for automotive expositions, but that was only her first year. Then her acting skills began to pay off. She had lovers who showered her with gifts of jewelry and money. Some of them offered marriage. The affairs were brief and ended on friendly terms.</div>

<div class="line_en">Her real life was the parts she played, she felt more alive as she brought her characters to life, carried them around inside her while living out her ordinary existence. Her love affairs were like amusements, playing golf and tennis, dining with friends, dreamlike substances.</div>

<div class="line_en">Acting was Life. Her secret knowledge of herself was serious. The dangers of the world were serious. But acting came first.

<div class="line_en">Real life was only in the cathedral-like theater: putting on makeup, adding one splash of color to her costume, her face contorting with emotions of the lines of the play running through her head, and then, looking into that deep blackness of the audience -- God finally showing his face -- she pleaded her fate. She wept, fell in love, screamed with anguish, begged forgiveness for her secret sins, and sometimes experienced the redemptive joy of happiness found.</div>

What she really could not believe, at the beginning, was that she had the indispensable ingredients of true genius: enormous energy and concentration. And curiosity.</div>

<div class="line_en">Acting and music were Athena's true loves, and to be able to concentrate on these things she used her energy to make herself expert in everything else.

<div class="line_en">She had a flaw. She could not bear to inflict pain on a fellow human being, and since in this life this was impossible to avoid, she was an unhappy woman. Yet she made hard-nosed decisions that furthered her place in the world. She used her power as a Bankable Star; she sometimes had a coldness that was as intense as her beauty. Powerful men beseeched her to appear in their movies, men begged to climb into her bed. She influenced, even demanded, the choosing of directors and costars. She could commit minor crimes without punishment, outrage custom, defy nearly all moralities, and who was to say who was the real Athena? She had the inscrutability of all Bankable Stars, she was a twin, you could not separate her real life from the lives she lived on screen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她也有缺点。她不愿意给周围的人带来困扰，可这类事情总是在所难免，因此她活得并不快乐。不过，为了出人头地，她仍然会作出非常现实的决定。她善于利用自己卖座红星的地位；她的冷酷有时一如她的美艳让人窒息。大导演求她出演电影，男人们期盼着爬上她的床。她能影响甚至干涉导演和演员的选择。她犯轻罪不受惩罚，她挑战传统，她蔑视几乎一切道德准则。谁都不知道哪个才是真正的安提娜。大牌明星有的神秘莫测她都有，银幕上的她和生活中的她是一对双胞胎，你无法区分她们之间的差别。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">All this and the world loved her, but that was not enough. She knew her inner ugliness. There was one person who did not love her and that caused her to suffer.

<div class="line_en">They were in Melo's office, a wonderfully decorated room with Oriental bric-a-brac, gold-threaded carpets, and heavy comfortable furniture all bathed in artificial lights since the curtains were closed to cut out daylight.

It was a dramatic comedy where laughter led to tears, one of the hardest things to do. Athena was impressed with Steven Stallings's skill.

Neither could afford to be more in love than the other and this equality in love was death to their passion. Also there was the question of geography. The affair ended when the picture ended. Athena went on location to India, Steven on location to Italy. There were phone calls and Christmas cards and gifts, they even flew to Hawaii for a weekend of ecstasy.

Not on a totally blank piece of paper, but he was adept at crossing out scenes and revising dialogue, and could actually create pieces of action, little set pieces, which sometimes played brilliantly but were seldom necessary to the story being told. What he prided himself on, what helped his pictures achieve financial success, was that he was especially good at endings, which were almost always triumphant, the exaltation of good over evil -- and if that didn't fit, the sweetness of defeat. His masterpiece had been the ending of a film that dealt with the atom-bomb destruction of New York, in which all the characters came out as better human beings dedicated to the love of their fellow man, even the one who had exploded the bomb. He had to hire five extra writers to get that done.</div>

<div class="line_en">He called in all his favors. He took all his money on the back end. He persuaded a top male star to take a part that was really a featured role and got Dita Tommey to direct.

<div class="line_en">And, as Skippy Deere later said to Claudia, that was where the movie should have ended: Happily Ever After. But now his wife had found real self-esteem, now she sensed her true worth. The proof was that she became a vehicle star, she now received scripts delivered by messenger, with roles for beautiful, celluloid-magic personalities. Deere advised her to look for something more suited to her, the next picture would be crucial. He had never worried about her being faithful, indeed had conceded her the right to have fun when she was on location. But now in the few months after her Award -- the toast of the town, invited to all the top parties, appearing in all the showbiz columns, courted by young actors struggling to get roles -- she blossomed into a fresh young womanhood. She went out, openly, on dates with actors fifteen years her junior. The gossip journalists took note, the feminists among them cheering her on.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就像斯基比·迪尔告诉克劳迪娅的一样，电影就应该这样结尾：从此过上了快乐的生活。但是现在他妻子重拾了自信，她意识到了自己的真正价值，她成了各大电影公司竞相追捧的明星，她的剧本有专人送到，角色都是一些美丽、充满大银幕魅力的人物。可是迪尔却建议她接一些更适合她的角色，下一步电影的成败至关重要。他从不怀疑她的不忠，事实上，他默许了她外出拍电影时寻欢作乐的自由。但是获奖之后没几个月，她成了街头巷尾热议的话题，所有的名流聚会都向她发出了邀请，她的名字出现在各种娱乐专栏上，年轻的男演员围着她大献殷勤以求谋个角色。她重新找回了年轻女性的魅力。她公开跟小她十五岁的演员约会。小报记者大写特写，女权主义者给她欢呼加油。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Skippy Deere seemingly took this very well. He understood the whole thing. After all, why did he himself keep screwing young girls? So why begrudge his wife equal pleasure? But then again why should he continue his extraordinary efforts to further Christi's career? Especially after she actually asked him for a role for one of her young lovers. He stopped looking for scripts for her, he stopped campaigning for her with other producers and directors and studio heads. And they, being older men, took umbrage for him in masculine brotherhood and no longer gave Christi any special consideration.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯基比·迪尔似乎完全接受了这一切。整件事情他都理解。不管怎么说，谁让他自己总是勾搭年轻女孩子呢？既然如此，他的妻子为什么不能享有同样的乐趣呢？但是话又说回来，他凭什么还要挖空心思拓展她的事业呢？尤其是她竟然真的开口替她的一个情人索要角色。他不再为她寻找剧本，不再利用其他制片人、导演和电影公司的大人物为她造势。出于男人之间的兄弟情义，这些老男人与他同仇敌忾，不再重用克里斯蒂。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Christi made two more pictures in a starring role; both were flops because she was miscast. And so she spent the professional credit the Award had earned for her. In three years, she was back to playing third female leads.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克里斯蒂又接了两部片子的主角，但是由于她选角失当，两部电影都遭遇了惨败。因此，她也耗尽了奥斯卡所带给她的信誉保证。三年之后，她又只能接第三女主角了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">By this time she had fallen in love with a young man who aspired to be a producer, indeed was very much like her husband, but he needed capital. So Christi sued for divorce, winning a huge settlement and $500,000 a year in alimony. Her lawyers never found out about Skippy's assets in Europe, so they parted friends. And now, seven years later, she had died in an automobile accident. By that time, although she had remained on Deere's Christmas card list, she was on his famous "Life Is Too Short" list, signifying he would not return her phone calls.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个时候她爱上了一个一心想成为制片人的小伙子。他的确很像她丈夫，但是他需要资金。克里斯蒂因而提起了离婚诉讼，得到了一幢大房子和每年五十万美元的赡养费。她的律师没有发现斯基比安置在欧洲的财产，所以他们还能和平地分了手。而现在，七年之后，她死于了车祸。那个时候，虽然迪尔的圣诞卡片名单上还有她，她却也被列在了他著名的“生命短暂”名单上——意思是，生命太短，时间有限，他是不会浪费时间回电话的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So Claudia De Lena had a twisted affection for Deere. For his exposing his true self to others, for his living his life so blatantly in his own self-interest, for his ability to look you in the eye and call you his friend while not caring that you knew he would never perform a true act of friendship. That he was such a cheerful, ardent hypocrite. And besides, Deere was a great persuader. And he was the only man she knew who could match wits with Cross. They took the next plane to Vegas.</div>
