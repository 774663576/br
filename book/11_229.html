<div class="line_en">It was evening, and the grey light was again waning fast, when they halted for the night. They were very weary. The mountains were veiled in deepening dusk, and the wind was cold. Gandalf spared them one more mouthful each of the miruvor of Rivendell. When they had eaten some food he called a council.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="傍晚时分，灰色的落日残光快速地消退，一行人暂时停下脚步，等待黑夜降临。他们身心俱疲，山脉遮盖在渐渐降临的暮色之中，风又强又冷。甘道夫又让大家喝了一口瑞文戴尔的米鲁活。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I wish I was back there," he said. "But how can I return without shame -- unless there is indeed no other way, and we are already defeated? "</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我也希望我已经回到那里去了，”他说：“但是除非真的无路可走，否则我怎么可能有脸回到瑞文戴尔去？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"We still have our journey and our errand before us," answered Gandalf. "We have no choice but to go on, or to return to Rivendell."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们眼前还是有任务和工作要做，”甘道夫回答道：“我们别无选择，如果不继续任务，就只能回到瑞文戴尔去。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You are right, Frodo," said Gandalf: "to go back is to admit defeat and face worse defeat to come. If we go back now, then the Ring must remain there: we shall not be able to set out again. Then sooner or later Rivendell will be besieged, and after a brief and bitter time it will be destroyed. The Ringwraiths are deadly enemies, but they are only shadows yet of the power and terror they would possess if the Ruling Ring was on their master's hand again."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你说得对，佛罗多，”甘道夫表示：“往回走就是承认失败，将来还会面临更恐怖的惨败。如果我们现在走回去，那么魔戒就必须留在瑞文戴尔。我们就再也无法带着魔戒离开那里。迟早，瑞文戴尔会遭到攻击，不久之后，它也会被摧毁。戒灵是要命的敌人，但是和他们主人万一持有制霸之戒的力量比起来，他们只是小巫见大巫。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Pippin's face brightened visibly at the mere mention of return to Rivendell; Merry and Sam looked up hopefully. But Aragorn and Boromir made no sign. Frodo looked troubled.</div>

<div class="line_en">"If it is a worse road than the Redhorn Gate, then it must be evil indeed," said Merry. "But you had better tell us about it, and let us know the worst at once."</div>

<div class="line_en">"There is a way that we may attempt," said Gandalf. "I thought from the beginning, when first I considered this journey, that we should try it. But it is not a pleasant way, and I have not spoken of it to the Company before. Aragorn was against it, until the pass over the mountains had at least been tried."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“还有一条路是我们可以尝试的，”甘道夫说：“我从一开始计划这趟旅程的时候就考虑过这条路，思索过我们是否应该尝试这个方法。但这可不是条轻松的道路，我之前也没有跟诸位提到这件事情。阿拉贡反对在我们尝试过山中隘道之前，跟各位提到这件事情。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The road that I speak of leads to the Mines of Moria," said Gandalf. Only Gimli lifted up his head; a smouldering fire was in his eyes. On all the others a dread fell at the mention of that name. Even to the hobbits it was a legend of vague fear:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我所说的路通往摩瑞亚矿坑，”甘道夫说。只有金雳猛然抬起头，眼中闪动着压抑的火焰。对于其他人来说，一阵寒意突然盖过了风雪归来的刺骨寒风，连哈比人都曾经听说过这个恐怖的地方。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The road may lead to Moria, but how can we hope that it will lead through Moria? " said Aragorn darkly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你说的路或许通往摩瑞亚，但我们怎么知道它能不能离开摩瑞亚？”阿拉贡陰郁地说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It is a name of ill omen," said Boromir. "Nor do I see the need to go there. If we cannot cross the mountains, let us journey southwards, until we come to the Gap of Rohan, where men are friendly to my people, taking the road that I followed on my way hither. Or we might pass by and cross the Isen into Langstrand and Lebennin, and so come to Gondor from the regions nigh to the sea."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这是个不祥的名字，”波罗莫说：“我也不赞成去那边。如果我们不能通过这座山脉，我们还是可以继续往南走，一直到对我们友善的领土，一直到洛汗隘口处。我来的时候就是这样走的。或者我们也可以沿着艾辛河取道靠海的道路，前往刚铎。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"As for the longer road: we cannot afford the time. We might spend a year in such a journey, and we should pass through many lands that are empty and harbourless. Yet they would not be safe. The watchful eyes both of Saruman and of the Enemy are on them. When you came north, Boromir, you were in the Enemy's eyes only one stray wanderer from the South and a matter of small concern to him: his mind was busy with the pursuit of the Ring. But you return now as a member of the Ring's Company, and you are in peril as long as you remain with us. The danger will increase with every league that we go south under the naked sky.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“至于那比较长的远路，我们则是没有时间浪费。如果走那边，我们可能会花上一年的时间，可能必须通过许多杳无人烟的荒野。那里并不安全。萨鲁曼、魔王的耳目都在该处出没。波罗莫，当你北上的时候，在魔王的眼中你不过是一名孤身的旅人。但你现在回来时，已经成了魔戒远征队的成员，只要和我们在一起，你就身陷极大的危机。只要我们越靠近南方，我们的危机也会越来越大。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Since our open attempt on the mountain-pass our plight has become more desperate, I fear. I see now little hope, if we do not soon vanish from sight for a while, and cover our trail. Therefore I advise that we should go neither over the mountains, nor round them, but under them. That is a road at any rate that the Enemy will least expect us to take."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“特别是自从我们对红角隘口的挑战失败之后，这危险更为浮现。如果我们不赶快无声无息地消失在敌人眼中，我会很担心未来的处境。因此，我建议我们不能够走山路，也不能够绕过去，而是必须走山底下，这是魔王最不会预料到的道路。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Things have changed since you came north, Boromir," answered Gandalf. "Did you not hear what I told you of Saruman? With him I may have business of my own ere all is over. But the Ring must not come near Isengard, if that can by any means be prevented. The Gap of Rohan is closed to us while we go with the Bearer.</div>

<div class="line_en">"We do not know what he expects," said Boromir. "He may watch all roads, likely and unlikely. In that case to enter Moria would be to walk into a trap, hardly better than knocking at the gates of the Dark Tower itself. The name of Moria is black."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们可不知道他会预料什么样的道路，”波罗莫说：“他可能会监视所有大大小小的道路。不管怎么样，走进摩瑞亚矿坑就像是走进陷阱中一样，并不比走到魔王家门口好多少，摩瑞亚就代表邪恶。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You speak of what you do not know, when you liken Moria to the stronghold of Sauron," answered Gandalf. "I alone of you have ever been in the dungeons of the Dark Lord, and only in his older and lesser dwelling in Dol Guldur. Those who pass the gates of Barad-dur do not return. But I would not lead you into Moria if there were no hope of coming out again. If there are Orcs there, it may prove ill for us, that is true. But most of the Orcs of the Misty Mountains were scattered or destroyed in the Battle of Five Armies. The Eagles report that Orcs are gathering again from afar; but there is a hope that Moria is still free.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“当你将摩瑞亚和索伦的要塞相比时，这是不恰当的作法，你对两者都没有足够的了解，”甘道夫回答：“在你们之中，我是唯一进过闇王地牢的人，而且还只是他在加尔哥多的行馆而已。那些进入要塞巴拉多的人都是有去无回。如果没有出来的希望，我也不会贸然带领诸位进入摩瑞亚。那边若还有半兽人居住的确很糟糕，但迷雾山脉大多数的半兽人，都在五军之战中被消灭或是被赶走了。巨鹰的情报是半兽人又在远方集结，但我还是认为摩瑞亚应该没受到污染才对。”">查看中文翻译</div>

In the ruins of the Dwarves, a dwarf's head will be less easy to bewilder than Elves or Men or Hobbits. Yet it will not be the first time that I have been to Moria.

<div class="line_cn" title="“好极了，金雳！”甘道夫说：“这对我真是个鼓励，我们要一起来找到那密门，我们会成功的！在矮人的废墟中，矮人会比精灵、人类或是哈比人冷静。但这也不是我第一次进入摩瑞亚，当年索尔之子索恩失踪的时候，我就曾经深入寻找他的踪迹。那里的确是畅通的，我就是一个活生生的例子！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At length they came to a sharp bend. There the road, which had been veering southwards between the brink of the channel and a steep fall of the land to the left, turned and went due east again. Rounding the corner they saw before them a low cliff, some five fathoms high, with a broken and jagged top. Over it a trickling water dripped, through a wide cleft that seemed to have been carved out by a fall that had once been strong and full.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不久之后，他们来到了一个急转弯。在这里，原先一直沿着陡坡和河谷往南边前进的小径，突然间变成由西向东的方向。一绕过这个转脚，他们就看见一个低矮的峭壁出现在眼前，大概有几十尺高，顶端显得破碎而不整齐。上面偶尔滴下一些极为稀少的流水；从眼前的景象看来，此地原来曾经是座相当宏伟的瀑布，也才会刻画出这么壮观的地形来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They found the stone steps without difficulty, and Gimli sprang swiftly up them, followed by Gandalf and Frodo. When they reached the top they saw that they could go no further that way, and the reason for the drying up of the Gate-stream was revealed. Behind them the sinking Sun filled the cool western sky with glimmering gold. Before them stretched a dark still lake. Neither sky nor sunset was reflected on its sullen surface. The Sirannon had been dammed and had filled all the valley. Beyond the ominous water were reared vast cliffs, their stern faces pallid in the fading light: final and impassable. No sign of gate or entrance, not a fissure or crack could Frodo see in the frowning stone.</div>

<div class="line_en">When they came to the northernmost corner of the lake they found a narrow creek that barred their way. It was green and stagnant, thrust out like a slimy arm towards the enclosing hills. Gimli strode forward undeterred, and found that the water was shallow, no more than ankle-deep at the edge. Behind him they walked in file, threading their way with care, for under the weedy pools were sliding and greasy stones, and footing was treacherous. Frodo shuddered with disgust at the touch of the dark unclean water on his feet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当他们来到湖最北边的角落时，发现一条狭窄的小溪挡住了去路。这条小溪泛着绿光，静滞不动，彷佛像是山丘往外伸出的黏稠手臂。金雳毫不迟疑的踏向前，发现小溪最浅的地方也不过及踝深而已。一行人小心翼翼的挑着路，跟在他后面前进。小溪中有很多深邃的缺口，可以踏足的岩石又长满了苔藓，必须十分小心才不会滑倒。佛罗多一踩到这污浊的溪水，就不禁打了个寒颤。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The day was drawing to its end, and cold stars were glinting in the sky high above the sunset, when the Company, with all the speed they could, climbed up the slopes and reached the side of the lake. In breadth it looked to be no more than two or three furlongs at the widest point. How far it stretched away southward they could not see in the failing light; but its northern end was no more than half a mile from where they stood, and between the stony ridges that enclosed the valley and the water's edge there was a rim of open ground. They hurried forward, for they had still a mile or two to go before they could reach the point on the far shore that Gandalf was making for; and then he had still to find the doors.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="天色已晚，冰冷的星光开始在渐落的太陽之上闪烁。一行人拔足飞奔，尽可能快速走上大路，来到湖的另外一边。看起来这座湖最宽的地方也不过只有三、四十尺，但是在逐渐黯淡的天色下，他们也搞不清楚湖面往南边延伸多远；唯一可以确定的是，北方的尽头距离这边不过半哩左右而已。在湖泊出口的两块多岩高地和湖水边有块开阔的空地。他们急忙赶向前，因为现在他们距离甘道夫的目的地还有一两里之遥，速度不快实在不行了。而且，到时他们还必须要寻找入口才行。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Gandalf now pressed on at a great pace, and the others followed as quickly as they could. They reached the strip of dry land between the lake and the cliffs: it was narrow, often hardly a dozen yards across, and encumbered with fallen rock and stones; but they found a way, hugging the cliff, and keeping as far from the dark water as they might. A mile southwards along the shore they came upon holly trees. Stumps and dead boughs were rotting in the shallows, the remains it seemed of old thickets, or of a hedge that had once lined the road across the drowned valley. But close under the cliff there stood, still strong and living,. two tall trees, larger than any trees of holly that Frodo had ever seen or imagined. Their great roots spread from the wall to the water. Under the looming cliffs they had looked like mere bushes, when seen far off from the top of the Stair; but now they towered overhead, stiff, dark, and silent, throwing deep night-shadows about their feet, standing like sentinel pillars at the end of the road.</div>

The dusk deepened, and the last gleams of the sunset were veiled in cloud.</div>

All were eager to get the journey over as quickly as possible, and were willing, tired as they were, to go on marching still for several hours. Gandalf walked in front as before. In his left hand he held up his glimmering staff, the light of which just showed the ground before his feet; in his right he held his sword Glamdring. Behind him came Gimli, his eyes glinting in the dim light as he turned his head from side to side. Behind the dwarf walked Frodo, and he had drawn the short sword, Sting. No gleam came from the blades of Sting or of Glamdring; and that was some comfort, for being the work of Elvish smiths in the Elder Days these swords shone with a cold light, if any Orcs were near at hand.

<div class="line_en">Gimli aided Gandalf very little, except by his stout courage. At least he was not, as were most of the others, troubled by the mere darkness in itself. Often the wizard consulted him at points where the choice of way was doubtful; but it was always Gandalf who had the final word. The Mines of Moria were vast and intricate beyond the imagination of Gimli, Gloin's son, dwarf of the mountain-race though he was. To Gandalf the far-off memories of a journey long before were now of little help, but even in the gloom and despite all windings of the road he knew whither he wished to go, and he did not falter, as long as there was a path that led towards his goal.</div>

In the pale ray of the wizard's staff, Frodo caught glimpses of stairs and arches and of other passages and tunnels, sloping up, or running steeply down, or opening blankly dark on either side. It was bewildering beyond hope of remembering.</div>

He will not go astray-if there is any path to find. He has led us in here against our fears, but he will lead us out again, at whatever cost to himself.

<div class="line_en">As these dangers became more frequent their march became slower. Already they seemed to have been tramping on, on, endlessly to the mountains' roots. They were more than weary, and yet there seemed no comfort in the thought of halting anywhere. Frodo's spirits had risen for a while after his escape, and after food and a draught of the cordial; but now a deep uneasiness, growing to dread, crept over him again. Though he had been healed in Rivendell of the knife-stroke, that grim wound had not been without effect. His senses were sharper and more aware of things that could not be seen. One sign of change that he soon had noticed was that he could see more in the dark than any of his companions, save perhaps Gandalf. And he was in any case the bearer of the Ring: it hung upon its chain against his breast, and at whiles it seemed a heavy weight. He felt the certainty of evil ahead and of evil following; but he said nothing. He gripped tighter on the hilt of his sword and went on doggedly.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Company behind him spoke seldom, and then only in hurried whispers. There was no sound but the sound of their own feet; the dull stump of Gimli's dwarf-boots; the heavy tread of Boromir; the light step of Legolas; the soft, scarce-heard patter of hobbit-feet; and in the rear the slow firm footfalls of Aragorn with his long stride. When they halted for a moment they heard nothing at all, unless it were occasionally a faint trickle and drip of unseen water. Yet Frodo began to hear, or to imagine that he heard, something else: like the faint fall of soft bare feet. It was never loud enough, or near enough, for him to feel certain that he heard it; but once it had started it never stopped, while the Company was moving. But it was not an echo, for when they halted it pattered on for a little all by itself, and then grew still.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was Gandalf who roused them all from sleep. He had sat and watched all alone for about six hours, and had let the others rest. "And in the watches I have made up my mind," he said. "I do not like the feel of the middle way; and I do not like the smell of the left-hand way: there is foul air down there, or I am no guide. I shall take the right-hand passage. It is time we began to climb up again."</div>

The passage they had chosen wound steadily upwards. As far as they could judge it went in great mounting curves, and as it rose it grew loftier and wider. There were now no openings to other galleries or tunnels on either side, and the floor was level and sound, without pits or cracks. Evidently they had struck what once had been an important road; and they went forward quicker than they had done on their first march.</div>

<div class="line_en">"For mithril," answered Gandalf. "The wealth of Moria was not in gold and jewels, the toys of the Dwarves; nor in iron, their servant. Such things they found here, it is true, especially iron; but they did not need to delve for them: all things that they desired they could obtain in traffic. For here alone in the world was found Moria-silver, or true-silver as some have called it: mithril is the Elvish name. The Dwarves have a name which they do not tell. Its worth was ten times that of gold, and now it is beyond price; for little is left above ground, and even the Orcs dare not delve here for it. The lodes lead away north towards Caradhras, and down to darkness. The Dwarves tell no tale; but even as mithril was the foundation of their wealth, so also it was their destruction: they delved too greedily and too deep, and disturbed that from which they fled, Durin's Bane. Of what they brought to light the Orcs have gathered nearly all, and given it in tribute to Sauron, who covets it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是为了秘银，”甘道夫回答：“摩瑞亚的宝藏不是矮人的玩具：黄金和珠宝；也不是他们的仆人：铁矿。这些东西的确在这里找的到，特别是铁矿的产量十分丰富。但这几样都可以透过贸易而得来。这里唯一的特产是摩瑞亚银，有些人称呼它为真银，精灵语则称呼它为秘银。矮人们对它的称呼不与外人分享。等量的秘银价值是黄金的十倍，现在则变成了无价之宝；因为只有极少数的秘银留在地面，而连半兽人都不敢在此开采秘银。整个矿坑直探地深，一直挖向卡拉霍拉斯底下的黑暗。矮人十分的务实，但也败在太过务实上。秘银虽然是他们财富的基础，却也带来了他们的末日：他们挖的太深、挖的太急，惊醒了邪恶的魔物：都灵克星。而他们辛辛苦苦挖出来的秘银则全被半兽人献给了索伦。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Mithril! All folk desired it. It could be beaten like copper, and polished like glass; and the Dwarves could make of it a metal, light and yet harder than tempered steel. Its beauty was like to that of common silver, but the beauty of mithril did not tarnish or grow dim. The Elves dearly loved it, and among many uses they made of it ithildin, starmoon, which you saw upon the doors. Bilbo had a corslet of mithril-rings that Thorin gave him. I wonder what has become of it? Gathering dust still in Michel Delving Mathom-house, I suppose."</div>

But now his thoughts had been carried away from the dark Mines, to Rivendell, to Bilbo, and to Bag End in the days while Bilbo was still there.

<div class="line_en">"I shall be glad," said Gimli. "I have looked on Moria, and it is very great, but it has become dark and dreadful; and we have found no sign of my kindred. I doubt now that Balin ever came here."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我应该要觉得高兴才对，”金雳说：“我目睹了摩瑞亚的壮丽，但它现在已经变得陰森恐怖，而且又看不出有任何我的同胞来过的迹象，我怀疑巴林是否曾经来过此地。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Frodo sat up. "Good morning! " said Gandalf: "For morning it is again at last. I was right, you see. We are high up on the east side of Moria. Before today is over we ought to find the Great Gates and see the waters of Mirrormere lying in the Dimrill Dale before us."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="佛罗多坐了起来，“早安！”甘道夫说：“终于又是早上了。你看吧，我说的没错。我们在摩瑞亚的东半部，今天天黑之前我们应该就可以找到大东门，看见丁瑞尔河谷中的镜影湖。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Maybe," said Gandalf. "But I do not know yet exactly where we are. Unless I am quite astray, I guess that we are above and to the north of the Great Gates; and it may not be easy to find the right road down to them. The eastern arch will probably prove to be the way that we must take; but before we make up our minds we ought to look about us. Let us go towards that light in the north door. If we could find a window it would help, but I fear that the light comes only down deep shafts."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“或许吧，”甘道夫说：“但我还是不知道目前确切的位置，除非我之前走得太偏，否则目前我们应该是在大东门的上方和北边的地方，要找到通往该处的正确道路可能并不简单。东边那扇拱门可能是我们必须要走的路；不过，在我们下定决心之前，最好到处看看，多收集一些情报。我们先察看一下北方的那光源，如果我们可以找到一扇窗户，应该有助于锁定方位。但是，我担心那光源可能是从很窄的通风口射进来的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No indeed! " said Boromir. "Which way shall we take? Yonder eastward arch? "</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“当然不想！”波罗莫说：“我们应该往那边走？还是朝着东边的拱门走吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After they had breakfasted Gandalf decided to go on again at once. "We are tired, but we shall rest better when we are outside," he said. "I think that none of us will wish to spend another night in Moria."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在众人吃过早餐之后，甘道夫决定再度出发。“我知道大家已经很疲倦了，不过，如果能够赶快出去，才能够安心休息，”他说：“我想，应该没有人愿意今晚再住在摩瑞亚里面吧？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It looks like a tomb," muttered Frodo, and bent forwards with a curious sense of foreboding, to look more closely at it. Gandalf came quickly to his side. On the slab runes were deeply graven:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这看起来像是个墓碑，”佛罗多嘀咕着，他好奇地弯身向前，希望能够看得更清楚。甘道夫飞快地走到他身边。在石板上可以看见很用力雕刻上去的符文。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Following his lead the Company passed under the northern arch. They found themselves in a wide corridor. As they went along it the glimmer grew stronger, and they saw that it came through a doorway on their right. It was high and flat-topped, and the stone door was still upon its hinges, standing half open. Beyond it was a large square chamber. It was dimly lit, but to their eyes, after so long a time in the dark, it seemed dazzlingly bright, and they blinked as they entered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="远征队在他的领导之下走过北方的拱门。他们发现自己身在一个很宽的走廊上。随着他们继续前进的脚步，那微弱的光芒越来越强烈，他们终于确定这是从右边的一个大门中射出来的。那扇高大的门半掩着，依旧可以开启。门内是个宽广的方形空间。虽然里面的光芒并不很强，但由于他们已经在黑暗中待了一段长时间，这光芒让他们觉得非常刺眼，走进房间的时候，一行人还必须不断地眨眼睛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Their feet disturbed a deep dust upon the floor, and stumbled among things lying in the doorway whose shapes they could not at first make out. The chamber was lit by a wide shaft high in the further eastern wall; it slanted upwards and, far above, a small square patch of blue sky could be seen. The light of the shaft fell directly on a table in the middle of the room: a single oblong block, about two feet high, upon which was laid a great slab of white stone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们的脚步惊扰了地上大量的灰尘，地上很多的东西，他们一开始根本看不清楚。这个大厅的光源来自于东边的一个开口。这个开口一路倾斜向苍穹，众人可以透过这开口看见一块蓝色的天空，照射进来的光芒，直接落在大厅中央的一个石桌上。那是一块方方正正的石柱所构成的，大概有两尺高，在顶端则有一块巨大的白色石板。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"These are Daeron's Runes, such as were used of old in Moria," said Gandalf. "Here is written in the tongues of Men and Dwarves: BALIN SON OF FUNDIN, LORD OF MORIA."</div>
