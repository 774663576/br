<div class="line_en">Danny was in the east-wing ballroom, standing on an over-stuffed, high-backed wing chair, looking at the clock under glass. It stood in the center of the ballroom's high, ornamental mantelpiece, flanked by two large ivory elephants.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="丹尼在东侧的舞厅里，站在一张填塞得胀鼓鼓的高背椅上，看着玻璃罩下的那座钟。它坐在舞厅里高高的起装饰作用的壁炉台正中，两边各有一头巨大的牙雕大象。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He almost expected the elephants would begin to move and try to gore him with their tusks as he stood there, but they were moveless. They were "safe." Since the night of the elevator he had come to divide all things at the Overlook into two categories. The elevator, the basement, the playground, Room 217, and the Presidential Suite (it was Suite, not Sweet; he had seen the correct spelling in an account book Daddy had been reading at supper last night and had memorized it carefully) -- those places were "unsafe." Their quarters, the lobby, and the porch were "safe." Apparently the ballroom was, too.</div>

<div class="line_en">He looked at the clock inside the glass dome. It was under glass because all its wheels and cogs and springs were showing. A chrome or steel track ran around the outside of these works, and directly below the clockface there was a small axis bar with a pair of meshing cogs at either end. The hands of the clock stood at quarter past XI, and although he didn't know Roman numerals he could guess by the configuration of the hands at what time the clock had stopped. The clock stood on a velvet base. In front of it, slightly distorted by the curve of the dome, was a carefully carved silver key.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他盯着圆顶玻璃罩里的钟。它放在玻璃罩下是因为它全部的齿轮、轮齿和弹簧都裸露在外面。一条铬质或钢质轨道绕在这些机件外面，钟面正下方有一条小小的轴棍，它的两端各有一对啮合轮牙。指针停在11点1刻上，他虽然不认识罗马数字，但可以根据指针的位置猜出钟停在什么时刻上。钟下面铺着天鹅绒，钟的前面有一把精雕细琢的银质钥匙，在圆顶玻璃罩下稍稍有点走样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Danny put his hands out, grasped the glass dome, and lifted it aside. He let one finger play over the works for a moment, the pad of his index finger denting against the cogs, running smoothly over the wheels. He picked up the silver key.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="丹尼伸出手，抓住玻璃罩，把它揭起来放在一边。他让一只指头摸着那些机件玩了一会儿，食指按了按轮齿，毫无阻拦地摸了一遍齿轮。他拿起那把银质钥匙。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It went firmly home with a tiny click, more felt than heard. It wound to the right, of course; clockwise.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不偏不倚，发出了很轻微的咔嗒一声，与其说是听到的，不如说是感觉到的。它向右边旋去，当然：顺时针方向。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="是的。而且它也没有特别小心不砸着他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Danny turned the key until it would turn no more and then removed it. The clock began to tick. Cogs turned. A large balance wheel rocked back and forth in semicircles. The hands were moving. If you kept your head perfectly motionless and your eyes wide open, you could see the minute hand inching along toward its meeting some forty-five minutes from now with the hour hand. At XII.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="丹尼转动着钥匙，直到再也转不动为止，然后拔出来。时钟滴滴答答走起来，齿轮转动起来，大大的平衡轮在半圆圈里荡去荡来。指针也动了起来。如果你的头保持完全不动，睁大眼睛，你可以看到分针为了45分钟后与时针会合在慢吞吞地往前赶路。12点。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He reached his index finger out again and pushed the minute band up to the hour, curious about what might happen. It obviously wasn't a cuckoo clock, but that steel rail had to have some purpose.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他又伸出了食指，把分针拨到正点位置上，他很想知道这样做会带来什么结果。显然，这不是一座布谷鸟钟，但那条钢轨一定有什么用途。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was a small, ratcheting series of clicks, and then the clock began to tinkle Strauss's "Blue Danube Waltz." A punched roll of cloth no more than two inches in width began to unwind. A small series of brass strikers rose and fell.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一阵细碎急促的咔嗒声响了起来，继而时钟里敲起了施特劳斯的《蓝色的多瑙河》。一卷宽不足两英寸的打上孔的布带开始展开。一小排铜锤此起彼落。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Danny espied tiny grooves in their sides, just below their armpits. The axis bar slipped into these grooves and he heard another small click. The cogs at either end of the bar began to turn. "The Blue Danube" tinkled. The dancers' arms came down around each other. The boy flipped the girl up over his head and then whirled over the bar. They were now lying prone, the boy's head buried beneath the girl's short ballet skirt, the girl's face pressed against the center of the boy's leotard. They writhed in a mechanical frenzy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="丹尼瞅到他们身体两侧有小小的滑槽，就在胳肢窝下面。那条轴棍滑进了槽里，他又听到一小声咔嗒。轴棍两端的轮齿转动起来，《蓝色的多瑙河》叮叮响着。两位舞者的手臂放下来互相搂着腰，男孩把女孩举过了头顶，接着在轴上旋转起来。这时，他们平躺着，男孩的头埋在女孩芭蕾舞短裙里，女孩的脸贴在男孩紧身衣的中间。他们疯狂地扭抱在一起。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">From behind the clockface two figures glided into view along the steel track, ballet dancers, on the left a girl in a fluffy skirt and white stockings, on the right a boy in a black leotard and ballet slippers. Their hands were held in arches over their beads. They came together in the middle, in front of VI.</div>

<div class="line_en">Beyond the double cathedral window he could see fresh snow beginning to sift down. The huge ballroom rug (rolled up for dancing, of course), a rich tangle of red and gold embroidery, lay undisturbed on the floor. Spaced around it were small, intimate tables for two, the spidery chairs that went with each upended with legs pointing at the ceiling.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他可以看到，在那扇大窗户外面，新雪又纷纷扬扬地飘落下来。舞厅里那张巨大的地毯（当然，为了跳舞，已经卷起来了）绣上了富丽堂皇的红色和金黄色的复杂图案，静静地躺在地板上。地毯周围分开摆放着一些两人用的让人产生亲近感的小桌子，现在，小桌边的结满蛛网的椅子都翻过来放着，椅腿直指天花板。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A moment later and things began to run backward. The boy whirled back over the axis bar. He flipped the girl into an upright position. They seemed to nod knowingly at each other as their hands arched back over their heads. They retreated the way they had come, disappearing just as "The Blue Danube" finished. The clock began to strike a count of silver chimes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="过了一会儿，刚才的过程又开始往回倒。男孩又旋回到轴上，把女孩拉了起来，俩人互相会意地点了点头，又将手翻转成拱形举上了头顶。他们开始按原路返回，《蓝色的多瑙河》结束时，他们消失了。然后时钟敲起一组银铃声。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But it wasn't really empty. Because here in the Overlook things just went on and on. Here in the Overlook all times were one. There was an endless night in August of 1945, with laughter and drinks and a chosen shining few going up and coming down in the elevator, drinking champagne and popping party favors in each other's faces. It was a not-yet-light morning in June some twenty years later and the organization hitters endlessly pumped shotgun shells into the torn and bleeding bodies of three men who went through their agony endlessly. In a room on the second floor a woman lolled in her tub and waited for visitors.</div>

<div class="line_en">But Tony was gone and suddenly he was in a dark room. But not entirely dark. Muted light spilling from somewhere. It was Mommy and Daddy's bedroom. He could see Daddy's desk. But the room was a dreadful shambles. He had been in this room before. Mommy's record player overturned on the floor. Her records scattered on the rug. The mattress half off the bed. Pictures ripped from the walls. His cot lying on its side like a dead dog, the Violent Violet Volkswagen crushed to purple shards of plastic.</div>
