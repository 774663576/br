<div class="line_en">Incest is difficult to define because the legal and psychological definitions are worlds apart. The legal definition is extremely narrow, usually defining incest as sexual intercourse between blood relations. As a result, millions of people did not realize they were incest victims because they had not been penetrated. From a psychological point of view, incest covers a much wider range of behaviors and relationships. These include physical contact with a child's mouth, breasts, genitals, anus, or any other body part, that is done for the purpose of sexually arousing the aggressor. That aggressor does not have to be a blood relative. He or she can be anyone whom the child perceives as a family member, such as a stepparent or an in-law.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the last two chapters, we have looked into some of the darker realities of toxic families. We have met parents who have an extraordinary lack of empathy and compassion for their children. They batter their children with every weapon from degrading criticism to leather belts, and they still rationalize their abuses as acts of discipline or education. But now we enter a realm of behavior so perverse that it defies rationalization. This is where I must leave behind strictly psychological theories: I believe that sexual violation of children is a genuinely evil act.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Incest is perhaps the cruelest, most baffling of human experiences. It is a betrayal of the most basic trust between child and parent. It is emotionally devastating. The young victims are totally dependent on their aggressors, so they have nowhere to run, no one to run to. Protectors become persecutors, and reality becomes a prison of dirty secrets. Incest betrays the very heart of childhood -- its innocence.</div>

</div>
<div class="line_en">There are other types of incestuous behaviors that are extremely damaging even though they may not involve any physical contact with the child's body. For example, if an aggressor exposes himself or masturbates in front of the child, or even persuades the child to pose for sexually suggestive photographs, he is committing a form of incest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There are also a number of far more subtle behaviors that I call psychological incest. Victims of psychological incest may not have been actually touched or assaulted sexually, but they have experienced an invasion of their sense of privacy or safety. I'm talking about invasive acts like spying on a child who is dressing or bathing, or repeatedly making seductive or sexually explicit comments to a child. While none of these behaviors fits the literal definition of incest, the victims often feel violated and suffer many of the same psychological symptoms as actual incest victims do.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We must add to our definition of incest that the behavior has to be kept secret. A father who affectionately hugs and kisses his child is doing nothing that needs to be kept secret. In fact, such touching is essential to a child's emotional well-being. But if that father strokes the child's genitals -- or makes the child stroke his -- that is an act that must be kept secret. That is an act of incest.</div>

<div class="line_en">When I first began my efforts to raise public awareness about the epidemic proportions of incest, I met with tremendous resistance. There is something particularly ugly and repellent about incest that keeps people from wanting even to acknowledge that it exists. In the last ten years, denial has begun to give way in the face of overwhelming evidence, and incest has become an acceptable -- if still uncomfortable -- topic for public discussion. But another obstacle still remains: the incest myths. They have long been articles of faith in our mass consciousness, beyond challenge. But they are not true, and they never were.</div>

<div class="line_en">MYTH: Incest is a rare occurrence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">REALITY: All responsible studies and data, including those from the U. S. Department of Human Services, show that at least one out of every ten children is molested by a trusted family member before the age of 18. Only as recently as the early 1980s did we begin to realize just how epidemic incest is. Prior to that time, most people believed that incest occurred in no more than one out of a hundred thousand families.</div>

<div class="line_en">REALITY: Incest is ruthlessly democratic. It cuts across all socio-economic levels. Incest can occur as easily in your family as in the back hills of Appalachia.</div>

<div class="line_en">MYTH: Incest happens only in poor or uneducated families or in isolated, backward communities.</div>

<div class="line_en">MYTH: Incest is a reaction to sexual deprivation.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">REALITY: The typical incest aggressor can be anybody. There is no common denominator or profile. They are often hardworking, respectable, churchgoing, seemingly average men and women. I've seen aggressors who were police officers, schoolteachers, captains of industry, society matrons, bricklayers, doctors, alcoholics, and clergymen. The traits they possess in common are psychological rather than social, cultural, racial, or economic.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">REALITY: Most aggressors have active sex lives within marriage, and often through extramarital affairs as well. They turn to children either for feelings of power and control or for the unconditional, nonthreatening love that only children can provide. Although these needs and drives become sexualized, sexual deprivation is rarely the trigger.</div>

<div class="line_en">REALITY: Most children try out their sexual feelings and impulses in innocent and exploratory ways with people to whom they are bonded. Little girls flirt with their fathers and little boys with their mothers. Some teenagers are openly provocative. However, it is always 100 percent the adult's responsibility to exercise appropriate control in these situations and not to act out their own impulses.</div>

<div class="line_en">REALITY: This myth was created by Sigmund Freud and has permeated psychiatric teaching and practice since the beginning of the century. In his psychoanalytic practice, Freud was getting so many reports of incest from the daughters of respected, middle-class Viennese families that he groundlessly decided they couldn't all be true. To explain their frequency, he concluded that the events occurred primarily in his patients' imaginations. The legacy of Freud's error is that thousands, perhaps millions, of incest victims have been, and in some cases continue to be, denied the validation and support they need, even when they are able to muster the courage to seek professional help.</div>

About a year later, I caught him watching me get dressed through a hole he had drilled in the wall of my bedroom. As I started developing, he would come up behind me and grab my breasts. Then, he'd offer me money to lie on the floor with my clothes off… so he could look at me. I felt really dirty, but I was afraid to say no. I didn't want to embarrass him. Then one day he took my hand and put it on his penis. I was so scared… When he started to fondle my genitals, I didn't know what to do, so I just did what he wanted.</div>

<div class="line_en">Controversial theories abound about the family climate and the role that other family members play. In my experience, however, one factor always holds true: incest simply doesn't happen in open, loving, communicative families.</div>

<div class="line_en">How Could This Ever Happen?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Instead, incest occurs in families where there is a great deal of emotional isolation, secrecy, neediness, stress, and lack of respect. In many ways incest can be viewed as part of a total family breakdown. But it is the aggressor and the aggressor alone who commits the sexual violence. Tracy described what it was like in her house:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We never talked about how we felt. If something bothered me, I just pushed it down. I do remember my mom cuddling me when I was little. But I never saw any affection between my mother and father. We did things together as a family, but there was no real closeness. I think that was what my father was looking for. Sometimes he would ask me if he could kiss me and I would say I didn't want to. Then he'd beg me and say he wouldn't hurt me, he just wanted to be close to me.</div>

<div class="line_en">It had not occurred to Tracy that if her father was lonely and frustrated, he had alternatives to molesting his daughter. Like many aggressors, Tracy's father looked within the family, to his daughter, in an attempt to make up for whatever deprivation he experienced. This distorted use of a child to take care of an adult's emotional needs can easily become sexualized if that adult cannot control his impulses.</div>

<div class="line_en">THE MANY FACES OF COERCION</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There is a tremendous amount of psychological coercion inherent in the parent-child relationship. Tracy's father didn't need to force his daughter into a sexual relationship.</div>

<div class="line_en">I would've done anything to make him happy. I was always terrified when he was doing that stuff to me, but at least he never got violent with me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Victims like Tracy, who have not been physically coerced, often underestimate the damage they've suffered because they don't realize that emotional violence is every bit as destructive as physical violence. Children are by nature loving and trusting, easy marks for a needy, irresponsible adult. A child's emotional vulnerability is usually the only leverage some incest aggressors need.</div>

<div class="line_en">Other aggressors reinforce their psychological advantage with threats of bodily harm, public humiliation, or abandonment. One of my clients was 7 when her father told her he would put her up for adoption if she didn't give in to his sexual demands. To a little girl, the threat that she would never see her family or friends again was terrifying enough to persuade her to do anything.</div>

<div class="line_en">In addition to psychological coercions, many aggressors resort to physical violence to force their children to submit to incest. Incest victims are rarely favored children, even apart from the sexual abuse. A few may receive money or gifts or special treatment as part of the coercion, but the majority are abused emotionally and often physically.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ninety percent of all incest victims never tell anyone what has happened, or what is happening, to them. They remain silent not only because they are afraid of getting hurt themselves, but to a great extent because they are afraid of breaking up the family by getting a parent into trouble. Incest may be frightening, but the thought of being responsible for the destruction of the family is even worse. Family loyalty is an incredibly powerful force in most children's lives, no matter how corrupt that family may be.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sexually abused children realize early that their credibility is nothing compared to their aggressors'. It doesn't matter if the parent is alcoholic, chronically unemployed, or prone to violence; in our society, an adult is almost always more believable than a child.

Parents, no matter how toxic, have a monopoly on power and credibility.</div>

<div class="line_en">Father-son incest is far more common than most people realize. Such fathers usually appear to be heterosexual, but they are probably driven by strong homosexual impulses.

<div class="line_en">Just as verbally and physically abused children internalize blame, so do incest victims. However, in incest, the blame is compounded by the shame. The belief that "it's all my fault" is never more intense than with the incest victim. This belief fosters strong feelings of self-loathing and shame. In addition to having somehow to cope with the actual incest, the victim must now guard against being caught and exposed as a "dirty, disgusting" person.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">If the victim experiences any pleasure from the incest, his or her shame is magnified. A few adults who were victims recall sexual arousal from the experience, regardless of the confusion or embarrassment they felt. It is even harder for these victims to later renounce their sense of responsibility. Tracy actually had orgasms. She explained:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The feelings of being dirty, bad, and responsible create tremendous psychological isolation for incest victims. They feel totally alone, both within the family and in the outside world. They think no one will believe their horrible secret, yet that secret so overshadows their lives that it often prevents them from making friends. This isolation in turn can force them back to the aggressor, who is often their only source of attention, no matter how perverse.</div>

<div class="line_en">There is one more guilt that is unique to many incest victims: taking father away from mother. Father-daughter victims often talk about having felt like "the other woman." This, of course, made it even harder for them to seek help from the one person they might have had reason to expect it from -- their mother. Instead, they felt they were betraying Mother, adding yet another layer of guilt to their inner world.</div>

<div class="line_en">There's nothing wrong with liking the stimulation. Your body is biologically programmed to like those feelings. But the fact that it felt good didn't make what he was doing right and it didn't make you wrong. You were still a victim. It was his responsibility, as an adult, to control himself, no matter what you felt.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Incest fuses the victim to the aggressor in a crazy and intense way. In father-daughter incest in particular, the father often becomes obsessed with his daughter and insanely jealous of her boyfriends. He may beat her or verbally abuse her to drive home the message that she belongs to only one man: Daddy.</div>

<div class="line_en">This obsession dramatically distorts the normal developmental stages of childhood and adolescence. Instead of being able to become progressively more independent from parental control, the incest victim is increasingly bonded to the aggressor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Most parents experience some anxiety when their children begin dating and start bonding to people outside the family. But the incestuous father experiences this normal stage of development as betrayal, rejection, disloyalty, and even abandonment. Tracy's father's reaction was typical -- rage, accusations, and punishment:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He would wait up when I was out on a date, and when I got home, he'd give me the third degree. He would question me endlessly about who I was going out with, what was I doing with him, where was I letting him touch me, and did I let him put his tongue in my mouth. If he so much as caught me kissing a boy good night, he'd come out of the house screaming "tramp," and scare the guy off.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In Tracy's case, she knew that her father's jealousy was crazy, but she didn't see how cruel and degrading it was because she confused it with love. It is common for incest victims to mistake obsession for love. Not only does this drastically alter their ability to understand that they are being victimized, but it can wreak havoc with their expectations of love later in life.</div>

<div class="line_en">ROBBED OF SEXUALITY</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Most incest victims have an especially difficult time with adult love relationships. If by chance a victim should manage to find a loving relationship, the ghosts from the past usually contaminate it -- often in the area of sexuality.</div>

<div class="line_en">Tracy's incest trauma seriously affected her marriage to a kind and caring man. She told me:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">My relationship with David is falling apart. He's a terrific guy, but how long can he put up with this? Sex is just terrible. It always has been. I don't even want to go through the motions anymore. I hate his touching me. I wish sex had never been invented.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Many victims talk about being unable to have sex without being haunted by flashbacks. They try to be intimate with someone they care about, but in their minds they are vividly reliving the original incest traumas. During sex, adults who were victims often see or hear their aggressors in the room with them. These flashbacks bring up all their negative feelings about themselves, and their sexuality fizzles like a doused fire.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It's quite common for a victim to feel revulsion at the thought of sex. This is a normal reaction to incest. Sex becomes an indelible reminder of the pain and betrayal. The tape starts playing in her head: "Sex is dirty, sex is bad… I did terrible things when I was little… if I do those terrible things now, I'll feel like a bad person again."</div>

<div class="line_en">I have lots of orgasms. I love to have sex every way possible. Where it gets really bad for me is afterwards. I get so depressed. When it's over, I don't want to be held or touched… I just want the guy to get away from me. He doesn't understand it. A couple of times when sex has been especially good for me, I had fantasies about killing myself afterwards.</div>

<div class="line_en">Other incest victims, like Connie, use their sexuality in self-denigrating ways because they've grown to believe that sex is all they're good for. Though they may have slept with hundreds of men in exchange for a little affection, many of these victims still feel repelled by sex.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A victim who, as an adult, has managed to become sexually responsive and orgasmic (and many do) may still feel guilty about her sexual feelings, making them difficult if not impossible to enjoy. Guilt can make good feelings feel bad.</div>

<div class="line_en">Even though Liz experienced sexual pleasure, she still had intense feelings of self-loathing. As a result, she needed to atone for this pleasure by punishing herself, even to the extent of visualizing suicide. It was as if by having these self-abasing feelings and fantasies, she could somehow make up for her "sinful" and "shameful" sexual arousal.</div>

<div class="line_en">Depression is an extremely common expression of suppressed incest conflicts. It may range from a general sense of sadness to nearly total immobilization.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the preceding chapter we saw victims of physical abuse turn their pain and rage against themselves -- or in some cases against others. Incest victims tend to follow the same patterns, releasing their repressed rage and unresolved grief in a wide variety of ways.</div>

<div class="line_en">A disproportionate number of incest victims, particularly women, allow themselves to become overweight as adults. The weight serves two important purposes for the victim: (1) she imagines it will keep men away from her, and (2) the body mass creates a false illusion of strength and power. Many victims become terrified when they first begin to lose weight because it makes them feel helpless and vulnerable once again.</div>

<div class="line_en">There is a baffling paradox in the fact that no matter how painful their lives have been, a great number of incest victims remain fused to their toxic parents. The pain came from those parents, but the victims still look to them to alleviate it. It is very hard for adult incest victims to give up the myth of the happy family.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A great number of incest victims also seek punishment from the world at large. They sabotage relationships, seeking punishment from the ones they love. They sabotage themselves at work, seeking punishment from colleagues or employers. A few commit violent crimes, seeking punishment from society. Others become prostitutes, seeking punishment from pimps, from patrons -- or even from God.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Many incest victims lose themselves in a haze of alcohol and drug abuse. This provides a temporary deadening of their feelings of loss and emptiness. However, this delay in confronting the real problem only prolongs the victim's suffering.</div>

<div class="line_en">Recurrent headaches are also common among incest victims. These headaches are not only a physical manifestation of repressed rage and anxiety but are also a form of self-punishment.</div>

<div class="line_en">One of the most powerful legacies of incest is this never-ending search for the magic key that will unlock the treasure chest of your parents' love and approval. This search is like emotional quicksand, bogging the victim down in an impossible dream, preventing her from getting on with her life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But despite this, it is usually the victim who ultimately has the clearest vision of the truth. She was forced to sacrifice herself to cover up the craziness and the stress in the family system. All her life she was the bearer of the family secret. She lived with tremendous emotional pain in order to protect the myth of the good family. But because of all this pain and conflict, the victim is usually the first to seek help. Her parents, on the other hand, will almost always refuse to let go of their denials and defenses. They refuse to deal with reality.</div>

<div class="line_en">I keep thinking that someday they will reach out and say, "We think you're wonderful and we love you the way you are."

<div class="line_en">Many people are shocked when I say that the incest victims I've worked with are usually the healthiest members of their families. After all, the victim usually has the symptoms -- self-blame, depression, destructive behaviors, sexual problems, suicide attempts, substance abuse -- while the rest of the family often seems outwardly healthy.</div>

<div class="line_en">With treatment, most victims are able to reclaim their dignity and their power. Recognizing a problem and seeking help is a sign not only of health but of courage.</div>
