<div class="line_en">A full moon bathed the scene with a golden light so brilliant that he could see perfectly. The immense gleaming cylinder of Karellen's ship lay beyond the buildings of the Overlord base, towering above them and reducing them to man-made proportions. Jan looked at the ship, trying to recall the emotions it had once roused in him. There was a time when it had been an unattainable goal, a symbol of all that he had never really expected to achieve. And now it meant nothing.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was Rashaverak who brought him the news, but he had already guessed it. In the small hours of the morning a nightmare had awakened him, and he had not been able to regain sleep. He could not remember the dream, which was very strange, for he believed that all dreams could be recalled if one tried hard enough immediately after waking. All he could remember of this was that he had been a small boy again, on a vast and empty plain, listening to a great voice calling in an unknown language.</div>

<div class="line_en">How quiet and still it was! The Overlords, of course would be as active as ever, but for the moment there was no sign of them. He might have been alone on Earth -- as, indeed, in a very real sense he was. He glanced up at the Moon, seeking some familiar sight on which his thoughts could rest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="真安静！此时外星人肯定还和白天一样继续工作着，可现在他们没有任何动静，地球上可能只剩下自己了，这种感觉来得格外真切。他抬头望着月亮，努力想平静下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There were the ancient, well-remembered seas. He had been forty light-years into space, yet he had never walked on those silent, dusty plains less than two light-seconds away. For a moment he amused himself trying to locate the crater Tycho. When he did discover it, he was puzzled to find that gleaming speck further from the centre line of the disc than he had thought. And it was then that he realized that the dark oval of the Mare Crisium was missing altogether. The face that her satellite now turned towards the Earth was not the one that had looked down on the world since the dawn of life. The Moon had begun to turn upon its axis.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="月球表面熟悉的古老海洋！自己虽然到过四十光年之外的太空，却从来没有去这些距离不足两光秒的地方走一走。他开始寻找第谷环形山，找到了，奇怪的是它离月球中心线的距离比想象的要远，而且那个熟悉的椭圆形阴暗区也完全消失了。月球那张熟悉的脸已经不再俯瞰地球了！它现在只是围绕自己的轴在运转。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That could mean only one thing. On the other side of the Earth, in the land that they had stripped so suddenly of life, they were emerging from their long trance. As a waking child may stretch its arms to greet the day, they too were flexing their muscles and playing with their new-found powers…</div>

<div class="line_en">"They are still playing," said Rashaverak. "What logic is there in the actions of a child? And in many ways the entity that your race has become is still a child. It is not yet ready to unite with the Overmind. But very soon it will be, and then you will have the Earth to yourself."</div>

In the inconceivable backwash of that departure, Jan did not expect that he and his problems would long survive.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="整个世界都是自己的了，所需要的物品应有尽有，随意取用。但所有这些，他都不感兴趣。他既不怕孤独，也不怕那个马上要出发离开的精灵。回想起上次的离别，扬知道自己和自己的问题不会一直存在下去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He turned his back upon the night and walked through the vast entrance of the Overlord base. Its size affected him not in the least: sheer immensity no longer had any power over his mind. The lights were burning redly, driven by energies that could feed them for ages yet. On either side lay machines whose secrets he would never know, abandoned by the Overlords in their retreat. He went past them, and clambered awkwardly up the great steps until he had reached the control room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="扬转身走进了外星人基地的大门，现在单凭一个“大”字已经不能对他产生任何影响了。基地里面仍然亮着红色的灯，他们剩下的能量足够这些灯亮上好几年，入口两侧摆着一些没有带走的设备，不知作什么用。他走过去，费劲地爬上巨大的台阶走进了控制室。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The spirit of the Overlords still lingered here: their machines were still alive, doing the bidding of their now far-distant masters. What could he add, wondered Jan, to the information they were already hurling into space?</div>

<div class="line_en">That was well. He had done all that he had wished to do, and to drag out a pointless life on this empty world would hive been unbearable anticlimax. He could have left with the Overlords, but for what purpose? For he knew, as no one else had ever known, that Karellen spoke the truth when he had said: "The stars are not for Man."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所有想做的事情都做完了，在这个寂静无人的世上，再苟延残喘地活着已经没有任何意义。如果和外星人一同离开，又有什么用？他比其他任何人都更明白卡瑞林的一句大实话：“人类永远不可能征服恒星。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Beyond the desk and its meaningless instrument panels, the wide windows looked out into the starry night, across a valley sleeping beneath a gibbous moon, and to the distant range of mountains. A river wound along the valley, glittering here and there as the moonlight struck upon some patch of troubled water. It was all so peaceful. It might have been thus at Man's birth as it was now at his ending.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="桌子上全是些看不懂的仪表。坐在桌前，透过宽大的窗户可以看到外面的星空，看到月光下沉睡的山谷和远处的群山。一条小河顺着山谷蜿蜒流淌着，映出粼粼的水波。万籁俱寂，人类诞生之初和人类结束时的世界都是这样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He climbed into the great chair and made himself as comfortable as he could. The microphone, already alive, was waiting for him: something that was the equivalent of a TV camera must be watching, but he could not locate it.</div>

<div class="line_en">Out there across unknown millions of kilometres of space, Karellen would be waiting. It was strange to think that the ship of the Overlords was racing away from Earth almost as swiftly as his signal could speed after it. Almost -- but not quite. It would be a long chase, but his words would catch the Supervisor and he would have repaid the debt he owed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="遥远的太空中，卡瑞林一定在等着自己的消息。飞船离开地球时的速度几乎和信号的传播速度同样快，自己的消息要传到飞船上一定需要相当长的时间，但卡瑞林终究会收到的，这样自己就可以偿还欠他的人情了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">How much of this, Jan wondered, had Karellen planned, and how much was masterful improvisation? Had the Supervisor deliberately let him escape into space, almost a century ago, so that he could return to play the role he was fulfilling now? No, that seemed too fantastic. But Jan was certain now, that Karellen was involved in some vast and complicated plot. Even while he served it, he was studying the Overmind with all the instruments at his command. Jan suspected that it was not only scientific curiosity that inspired the Supervisor: perhaps the Overlords had dreams of one day escaping from their peculiar bondage, when they had learned enough about the powers they served.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不知道今天这事有多少是卡瑞林早就策划好的，又有多少是临时想到的？当初，卡瑞林是不是故意让自己溜进太空，好让自己回来后发挥现在的作用？不可能，太离奇了！但扬敢肯定卡瑞林有个宏伟计划：在为超智慧服务的同时，也在利用所有可能的仪器研究它。卡瑞林这样做显然不只是出于好奇，也许这些外星人盼着有朝一日能够了解那些神奇力量，彻底摆脱束缚。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">That Jan could add to that knowledge by what he was now doing seemed hard to believe. "Tell us what you see," Rashaverak had said. "The picture that reaches your eyes will be duplicated by our cameras. But the message that enters your brain may be very different, and it could tell us a great deal." Well, he would do his best.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="扬不知道自己现在正在做的事能对他们有什么帮助？“告诉我们你看到的一切。”瑞沙维莱克说，“你所看到的一切都会被摄像机自动复制出来，但进入你脑海中的信息和我们可能不同。这种信息对我们很有用。”好的，那就尽力而为吧。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Still nothing to report," he began. "A few minute, ago I saw the trail of your ship disappear in the sky. 'The Moon is just past full, and almost half its familiar side has now turned away from Earth -- but I suppose you already know that."</div>

<div class="line_en">Here was the climax of all history, yet he might have been a radio-commentator at a race-track or a boxing-ring. Then he shrugged his shoulders and put the thought aside.</div>

"Their control of Earth's spin must be marvellous, but not quite perfect… You know, Karellen, I'm going to find it very hard to say anything your instruments haven't already told you. It might have helped if you'd given me some idea of what to expect, and warned me how long I may have to wait. If nothing happens, I'll report again in six hours, as we arranged.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“过去一个小时出现了三次轻微地震，”他接着说，“他们对地球自转有很强的控制力，但还不够熟练。卡瑞林，我觉得我所说的你都能从仪器上知道，实在没有什么新东西可报告。你最好还是告诉我你们想听什么，或者我还要再等多久。如果没有新情况发生，就照计划，我六个小时后再报告…”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“现在——这绝对不是想象——整个世界都空了，完全空了，就像正在收听收音机，突然什么声音也没有了一样。天上那张模糊的网已经消失了，它又到哪里了，卡瑞林？你又要到哪里去帮它？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Strange: everything around me is unaltered. I don't know why, but somehow I'd thought that --" Jan stopped. For a moment he struggled for words, then closed his eyes in an effort to regain control. There was no room for fear or panic now: he had a duty to perform -- a duty to Man, and a duty to Karellen. Slowly at first, like a man awaking from a dream, he began to speak.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“奇怪，周围的一切都没有发生任何变化，我不知道为什么，但我认为…”扬停住了，闭上眼睛积蓄着力量，想努力说完自己的话。现在他已经不再害怕，他有一个职责要完成，既是对人类的，也是对卡瑞林的。好像从梦中醒来，他开始慢慢接着讲：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It's only a few seconds away. There go the mountains, like wisps of smoke. Goodbye, Karellen, Rashaverak -- I am sorry for you. Though I cannot understand it, I've seen what my race became. Everything we ever achieved has gone up there into the stars. Perhaps that's what the old religions were trying to say. But they got it all wrong: they thought mankind was so important, yet we're only one race in -- do you know how many? Yet now we've become something that you could never be.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“短短几秒钟，山脉没有了，像一缕轻烟，再见了，卡瑞林，瑞沙维莱克，我很抱歉，我不能理解人类变成了什么，但我亲眼看到了。我们的一切成就都已经到了天上，也许那些古老的宗教就想说明这一点。但它们错了，他们把人类看得太重要了，实际上我们只是其中的一支，你知道总共有多少吗？现在我们变成了你们永远不可能的形式。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In a soundless concussion of light, Earth's core gave up its hoarded energies. For a little while the gravitational waves crossed and recrossed the Solar System, disturbing ever so slightly the orbits of the planets. Then the Suit's remaining children pursued their ancient paths once more, as corks floating on a placid lake ride out the tiny ripples set in motion by a falling stone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在强光的无声冲击下，地核释放出了积蓄已久的能量，顷刻间引力波一次又一次地冲击整个太阳系，其他行星并没有受到很大影响，它们依旧沿着古老的轨道运行着，就像水面漂浮的木塞随着石头投入水中产生的涟漪在轻轻荡漾。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was nothing left of Earth. They had teethed away the last atoms of its substance. It had nourished them, through the fierce moments of their inconceivable metamorphosis, as the food stored in a grain of wheat feeds the infant plant while it climbs towards the Sun.</div>

<div class="line_en">Six thousand million kilometres beyond the orbit of Pluto, Karellen sat before a suddenly darkened screen. The record was complete, the mission ended; he was homeward bound for the world he had left so long ago. The weight of centuries was upon him, and a sadness that no logic could dispel. He lid not mourn for Man: his sorrow was for his own race, forever barred from greatness by forces it could not overcome.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在冥王星轨道六兆公里以外的太空，卡瑞林坐在突然变黑的屏幕前，所有的记录都很完整，任务已经结束。他正朝着久别的家飞去，几百年的沉淀压在身上，有一种无法驱走的伤感。他不为人类伤心，他伤心的是自己的种族被无法征服的力量永远排斥在外。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The great control screen flared for a moment with sombre, ruby light: without conscious effort, Karellen read the message of its changing patterns. The ship was leaving the frontiers of the Solar System: the energies that powered the stardrive were ebbing fast, but they had done their work.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="屏幕上突然出现了暗红色的光亮，卡瑞林读着上面不停变幻的图形。此时，飞船正在离开太阳系边缘，驱动飞船的能量正在快速减少，但它们已经完成了任务。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Yet, Karellen knew, they would hold fast until the end: they would await without despair whatever destiny was theirs. They would serve the Overmind because they had no choice, but even in that service they would not lose their souls.</div>

<div class="line_en">For all their achievements, thought Karellen, for all their mastery of the physical universe, his people were no better than a tribe that had passed its whole existence upon some flat and dusty plain. Far off were the mountains, where power and beauty dwelt, where the thunder sported above the glaciers and the air was clear and keen. There the sun still walked, transfiguring the peaks with glory, when all the land below was wrapped in darkness. And they could only watch and wonder: they could never scale those heights.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尽管他们有很多伟大的成就，能够把握整个物质世界，但他们不过是一个只能在尘世上走完所有历程的种族。远处那些神奇的大山，雄壮美丽，巨雷在冰川上隆隆滚动，空气清新凛冽，一颗恒星也在那里的空中运行，装点得山峰越发壮观。大山之下所有的大地都笼罩在一片黑暗之中。他们只能望着那些大山，发出声声惊叹，他们自己永远也达不到那样的高度。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Karellen raised his hand, and the picture changed once more. A single brilliant star glowed in the centre of the screen: no one could have told, from this distance, that the Sun had ever possessed planets or that one of them had now been lost. For a long time Karellen stared back across that swiftly widening gulf, while many memories raced through his vast and labyrinthine mind. In silent farewell, he saluted the men he had known, whether they had hindered or helped him to his purpose.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡瑞林举起手，屏幕上的画面又变了。屏幕正中出现了一颗明亮的恒星。隔着这样的距离，根本看不出它拥有行星并且刚刚还失去了其中一颗。卡瑞林久久凝望着那个离得越来越远的恒星，脑海中闪过无数的记忆，他默默地向那些地球上的人致意，不管他们曾经阻止过自己，还是帮助过自己。">查看中文翻译</div>
