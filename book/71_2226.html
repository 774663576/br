<div class="line_en">Although the meal was due to begin only at noon, this gallery was crowded with impatient onlookers from eleven o'clock in the morning. These were a few chosen sailors from the Pharaon and some soldiers who were Dantès' friends. All of them were in their Sunday best, in honour of the engaged couple.</div>

<div class="line_en">The meal had been set out on the first floor of the same inn, La Réserve, with the terrace of which we are already acquainted. It was a large room, lit by five or six windows, above each of which (for some inexplicable reason) was inscribed the name of one of the great towns of France. A gallery -- of wood, like the rest of the building -- ran the whole length of the room under the windows.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="里瑟夫酒家已备下丰富的酒筵（酒家的那座凉棚是读者们已熟悉了的）。摆席的那个大厅很是宽敞，并排的开着几扇大窗，每个窗口上用金字写着法国各大城市的名字。在这排窗口底下，是一条跟屋子一样长的木板走廊。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The rumour circulating among these expectant guests was that the owners of the Pharaon were to honour its first mate's betrothal feast with their presence, but this would have been to do such a great honour to Dantès that no one yet dared believe it. However, Danglars, when he arrived with Caderousse, confirmed the news: he had seen M. Morrel himself, that morning, and M. Morrel had said that he would be dining at La Réserve.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大家都纷纷传说，埃及王号的船主要来参加婚筵，可是大家又似乎都不敢相信邓蒂斯能有这样大的面子。与卡德罗斯同来的邓格拉司终于证实了这个消息，说他刚才和摩莱尔先生相遇，摩莱尔先生亲口说要来参加他大副的婚礼。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Danglars and Caderousse set off at full speed, but had hardly gone any distance before they saw the little band approaching, just coming past the powder magazine. It was made up of four young women, friends of Mercédès and Catalans like her, who were accompanying the fiancée while Edmond gave her his arm. Next to her walked Old Dantès and behind them came Fernand, with his sour smile.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="二人受命赶速前去，但他们还没有走出百步，就有一群人向他们迎面走来，前面是那对未婚夫妇和一群伴随新娘的青年姑娘，新娘的旁边是邓蒂斯的父亲。他们的后面跟着弗南，他的嘴唇上仍旧挂着他那常带的阴险的微笑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Indeed, a moment later, M. Morrel made his entrance into the room and was saluted by the crew of the Pharaon with a unanimous burst of applause and shouts of "Hurrah!" The owner's presence was seen by them as confirmation of a rumour, already going about, that Dantès was to be appointed captain; and, since Dantès was much liked on board, the men took this way of thanking the owner because, for once, his choice was concordant with their wishes. Hardly had M. Morrel entered than Danglars and Caderousse were, by general agreement, dispatched to find the fiancé, with orders to advise him of the arrival of this important person whose appearance had caused such a stir, and to tell him to hurry.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="果然不错，片刻以后，摩莱尔先生已在房内出现。水手们一致向他欢呼。船主的光临在他们看来是一个确证，证明这次婚礼的主人翁不久就要做埃及王号的船长，而邓蒂斯又是船上所一致爱戴的人物，所以当水手们发现他们上司的意见和选择正好符合了他们的希望，也就禁不住欢喜起来。这一阵嘈杂而亲热的欢迎过去以后，邓格拉司和卡德罗斯就被派去到新郎家中报告重要人物业已到临的消息，希望他赶快来迎接他的贵宾。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The old man was wearing his fine coat of fluted taffeta, decorated with large-faceted steel buttons. His lanky but vigorous legs were clothed in a splendid pair of spotted stockings that cried out English contraband. A mass of white and blue ribbons hung from his three-cornered hat. Finally, he was supported by a stick of twisted wood, bent at the top like a classical staff or pedum. He looked like one of those dandies who used to parade in 1796 in the newly re-opened gardens of the Luxembourg or the Tuileries.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="老邓蒂斯穿着一套剪裁合体、熨得笔挺、钉着铁钮扣的黑衣服。他那瘦而依旧相当有力的腿上穿着一双脚踝处绣满了花的长统袜子，一望而知是英国货；他的三角帽上垂下一长条蓝白色丝带结成的穗子；拄着一根雕刻得很奇特的手杖。他看起来像是1796年在卢森堡重新开放的花园或杜伊勒里公园游行的花花公子之一。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Danglars and Caderousse discharged their diplomatic mission, then exchanged a warm and energetic handshake with Edmond, and took up their places, Danglars next to Fernand and Caderousse beside Old Dantès, who was the general centre of attention.</div>

<div class="line_en">Dantès was dressed simply. Since he belonged to the merchant marine, his clothes were halfway between military uniform and civilian dress; in this habit, his evident good health, set off against the happiness and beauty of his fiancée, was perfect.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="邓蒂斯的衣着虽很合式，却也很简单，他穿着一套半似军服，半似便服的商船船员制服。他那漂亮的脸上闪耀着喜悦和幸福的光芒，显得更加好看。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As he came up to Fernand, Danglars searched deep into the disappointed lover's soul. He was walking behind the engaged couple, entirely forgotten by Mercédès, who, with the childlike and endearing egoism of love, had eyes only for her Edmond. Fernand was pale, then his colour would heighten suddenly, only to give way again to a deepening pallor. From time to time he looked towards Marseille, and an involuntary nervous tremor would shake his limbs. He seemed to be expecting, or at least to anticipate the possibility of, some important event.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="邓格拉司向那个失恋的情人走近去的时候，含有深意地对他看了一眼。弗南脸色苍白，带着茫然的神情慢慢地跟在那一对幸福的人儿后面，而前面那一对满心喜欢的人却似乎已完全忘记了有他这样一个人存在。他的脸上偶尔会突然涨得通红，神经质地抽搐一下，用一种焦急不安的凝视向马赛那方面一瞥，好象在期待某种惊人的大事似的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mercédès was as lovely as one of those Greek women of Cyprus or Chios, with jet-black eyes and coral lips. She stepped out with the frankness and freedom of an Arlésienne or an Andalusian woman. A city girl might perhaps have tried to conceal her joy under a veil or at least beneath the velvet shade of her eyelids, but Mercédès smiled and looked at all those around her; and her look and her smile said as plainly as she could have in words: if you are my friends, rejoice with me, because I am truly happy!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="美茜蒂丝可爱得象塞浦路斯或凯奥斯的希腊美女一样，她睁大着一对明亮发光，象乌玉似的眼睛，张开她那珊瑚似的嘴唇，用阿尔妇女和安达卢西亚妇女那种自由自在的步伐走着。假如她是一个城市里的姑娘，她一定会把她的喜悦掩饰起来，或至少垂下她那浓密的睫毛，以掩饰她那一对水汪汪的热情的眼睛，但美茜蒂丝只是微笑着左右顾盼，好象在说：“假如你们是我的朋友，那末和我一起高兴吧，因为我确实是非常快乐呢。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Father," Mercédès said, stopping at the middle of the table, "you go on my right, I pray you; and on my left, I shall place the one who has been a brother to me." She spoke with such softness that it struck Fernand to the depth of his soul like a blow from a dagger. His lips paled and, under the tanned colouring of his masculine features, you could once more see the blood draining bit by bit as it flooded into his heart.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“爹，”美茜蒂丝走到桌子前面停下来说，“请您坐在我的右手，左手这个位置我要让一位始终象亲兄弟那样照顾我的人坐，”她这句温柔而亲密的话象一把匕首似的戳入弗南的心。他的嘴唇苍白了，甚至在他的棕黑的皮肤之下，也可以看到血液突然退去，象是受了某种意外的压缩，把血液驱回到心脏去了一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Meanwhile Dantès had done the same: on his right, he placed M. Morrel, and on his left Danglars. Then he signalled to everyone to sit down wherever they wished.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时，在桌子对面的邓蒂斯，也同样的在安排他最尊贵的来宾摩莱尔先生坐在他的右手，邓格拉司坐在他的左手，其余的人各自找了他们认为最适当的位置坐下。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As soon as the couple and those accompanying them were in sight of La Réserve, M. Morrel came down and set out to meet them, followed by the sailors and soldiers: he had stayed with them to renew the promise he had already made to Dantès himself, that he would succeed Captain Leclère. Seeing him approach, Edmond let go of his fiancée's arm, which he placed under M. Morrel's. Thus the shipowner and the young woman gave a lead by going first up the wooden stairs leading to the room where dinner was served, and the staircase groaned for five minutes under the heavy feet of the guests.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当结婚的行列进入里瑟夫酒家的视线以内时，摩莱尔先生就迎上前来，后面跟随着早已聚集在那儿的士兵和水手，他们已从摩莱尔先生那儿知道他已允许过的诺言，知道邓蒂斯就要做已故黎克勒船长的后继人。爱德蒙一走近雇主的前面，就把他未婚妻的手臂递给摩莱尔先生，后者就带着她踏上木头楼梯，向摆好酒席的大厅走去，宾客们嘻嘻哈哈地跟在后面，楼梯在拥挤的人群脚下吱吱地呻吟着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，那倒不必过虑，邻居卡德罗斯，这种小事是不值和我一驳的。不错，美茜蒂丝现在还不能真正算是我的妻子，可是，”他掏出表来看了一看，又说，“再过一个半钟头，她就是了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes, friends," Dantès replied. "Thanks to an advance from Monsieur Morrel, the man to whom -- after my father -- I owe the most in the world, all our difficulties have been overcome. We have paid for the banns and at half-past two the Mayor of Marseille is expecting us at the Town Hall.
