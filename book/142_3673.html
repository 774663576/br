<div class="line_en">The night before Michael had also sent word to Carlo Rizzi that he would require his presence on the mall for a few days, that he could join his wife and children later that week. Connie had been furious. She had tried to get Michael on the phone, but he had gone into the city. Now her eyes were searching the mall for him, but he was closeted with Tom Hagen and not to be disturbed. Connie kissed Carlo good-bye when he put her in the limousine. "If you don't come out there in two days, I'll come back to get you," she threatened him.</div>

<div class="line_en">On that same day two limousines parked on the Long Beach mall. One of the big cars waited to take Connie Corleone, her mother, her husband and her two children to the airport. The Carlo Rizzi family was to take a vacation in Las Vegas in preparation for their permanent move to that city. Michael had given Carlo the order, over Connie's protests. Michael had not bothered to explain that he wanted everyone out of the mall before the Corleone-Barzini Families' meeting. Indeed the meeting itself was top secret. The only ones who knew about it were the capos of the Family.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Sure, Mike, sure," Carlo said. He went into his own house, made a phone call to the mistress he was discreetly keeping in Westbury, promising he would try to get to her late that night. Then he got set with a bottle of rye and waited. He waited a long time. Cars started coming through the gate shortly after noontime. He saw Clemenza get out of one, and then a little later Tessio came out of another. Both of them were admitted to Michael's house by one of the bodyguards. Clemenza left after a few hours, but Tessio did not reappear.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“当然行，迈克，当然行，”卡罗说。说罢，他回到自己家里，马上打电话给他谨慎地安排在西堡镇的情妇，约好在当天夜里去她那里。然后，他喝一瓶黑麦威士忌定了定神，就安心等着，等了好久。中午过后不久，开始有汽车进入大门。他看到克莱门扎从一辆汽车里出来，接着，忒希奥从另一辆汽车里出来。他们两个都得到了保镖的允许走进了迈克尔住的那栋楼房。儿个钟头之后，克莱门扎就离开了。但忒希奥却一直没有出来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Carlo took a breath of fresh air around the mall, not more than ten minutes. He was familiar with all the guards who pulled duty on the mall, was even friendly with some of them. He thought he might gossip a bit to pass the time. But to his surprise none of the guards today were men he knew. They were all strangers to him. Even more surprising, the man in charge at the gate was Rocco Lampone, and Carlo knew that Rocco was of too high a rank is the Family to be pulling such menial duty unless something extraordinary was afoot.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡罗出来在林荫道周围呼吸了一会儿新鲜空气。时间也不过十分钟而已。他同那些站岗放哨的保卫人员都很熟悉，同其中儿个甚至还很友好。他想不妨聊聊天，混混时间，但是，使他感到莫名其妙的是，今天值勤的，他一个也不认识。在他看来，他们全是陌生人。甚至更加莫名其妙的是，负责守大门的居然是罗科·拉朋。卡罗知道，罗科在考利昂家族的地位是很高的，除非发生了异常事件，一般他是不会屈尊执行这种任务的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="卡罗没有理会他话中的言外之意。他说：“迈克尔办事是经过认真考虑的。”对这样的反驳，罗科默默地接受了下来。卡罗说了声“再见”，就回家去了。山雨欲来风满楼，但是卡罗却不知道是怎么回事。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Upstate in the city of Buffalo, a small pizza parlor on a side street was doing a rush trade. As the lunch hours passed, business finally slackened off and the counterman took his round tin tray with its few leftover slices out of the window and put it on the shelf on the huge brick oven. He peeked into the oven at a pie baking there. The cheese had not yet started to bubble. When he turned back to the counter that enabled him to serve people in the street, there was a young, tough-looking man standing there. The man said, "Gimme a slice."</div>

<div class="line_en">The pizza counterman took his wooden shovel and scooped one of the cold slices into the oven to warm it up. The customer, instead of waiting outside, decided to come through the door and be served. The store was empty now. The counterman opened the oven and took out the hot slice and served it on a paper plate. But the customer, instead of giving the money for it, was staring at him intently.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="店员拿起木铲，铲起一个冷馅饼，放进炉子里烘一烘。顾客不在外面等，却从门里进来了，等着人家给他把馅饼送过来。店里眼下再也没有别的顾客了。店员揭开炉子，取出热馅饼，用纸盘端了上来。不过，那个顾客并没有马上付钱，却瞪着店员。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The counterman started backing toward the rear of the store, aiming to edge around the huge oven. But the customer raised his hand above the counter. There was a gun in it. He fired. The bullet caught the counterman in the chest and hurled him against the oven. The customer fired into his body again and the counterman slumped to the floor. The customer came around the serving shelf, reached down and ripped the buttons off the shirt. The chest was covered with blood, but the tattoo was visible, the intertwined lovers and the knife transfixing them. The counterman raised one of his arms feebly as if to protect himself. The gunman said, "Fabrizzio, Michael Corleone sends you his regards."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="店员听了马上向店铺里面退去，想绕到大炉灶的那边去。但是，顾客早已把手抬到柜台上面来了。他手里拿着枪，开火了，子弹打在店员的胸膛上；店员一晃，靠在炉子上。顾客瞄准他的身子又打了一枪，于是店员跌倒在地上。顾客绕过售货架，弯下腰，把店员衬衫上的钮扣打开，胸膛上满是血，但刺的花纹还可以看得很清楚：一对紧紧拥抱着的情人，一把长刀把两个都刺穿了。店员有气无力地抬起一只胳膊，仿佛是要进行自卫似的。带枪的刺客说。“法布里吉奥，迈克尔·考利昂要我问候你。”">查看中文翻译</div>

Then he turned and ran back to the car. The two men dropped him off in the Wantagh station. He picked up his car and drove back to the mall.

He had turned in his gun when he was suspended from the force, but, through some administrative oversight they had not made him give up his shield. Clemenza had supplied him with a new.38 Police Special that could not be traced. Neri broke it down, oiled it, checked the hammer, put it together again, clicked the trigger. He loaded the cylinders and was set to go.</div>

<div class="line_en">At 55th Street and Fifth Avenue the car pulled over to the curb and Neri got out. He started walking down the avenue. He had a queer feeling being back in uniform, patrolling the streets as he had done so many times. There were crowds of people. He walked downtown until he was in front of Rockefeller Center, across the way from St. Patrick's Cathedral. On his side of Fifth Avenue he spotted the limousine he was looking for. It was parked, nakedly alone between a whole string of red NO PARKING and No STANDING signs. Neri slowed his pace. He was too early. He stopped to write something in his summons book and then kept walking. He was abreast of the limousine. He tapped its fender with his nightstick. The driver looked up in surprise. Neri pointed to the NO STANDING sign with his stick and motioned the driver to move his car. The driver turned his head away.</div>

<div class="line_en">She had worked herself into hysteria again. She tried to spit in Michael's face but she had no saliva.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她说着说着又歇斯底里大发作了。她拼命想往迈克尔脸上吐口水，但是她把嘴说干了，吐不出口水来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Connie had recovered from her hysteria. Her voice held a deadly venom. "Why do you think he was always so cold to me? Why do you think he kept Carlo here on the mall? All the time he knew he was going to kill my husband. But he didn't dare while my father was alive. My father would have stopped him. He knew that. He was just waiting. And then he stood Godfather to our child just to throw us off the track. The coldhearted bastard. You think you know your husband? Do you know how many men he had killed with my Carlo? Just read the papers. Barzini and Tattaglia and the others. My brother had them killed."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="康妮从歇斯底里中恢复过来了。她的声音仍然流露着势不两立的仇恨。“他为什么一直对我很冷淡，你是怎么想的？他为什么让卡罗留在林萌道，你又是怎么想的？他一直都想杀害我丈夫，但我父亲活着的时候，他不敢下手。我父亲会制止他。这他自己明白。他硬是等机会。当时他给我们的孩子当教父，只是为了迷惑我们，转移我们的视线，真是个笑面虎，臭杂种。你以为你了解你丈夫吗？你知道他在杀害我丈夫的同时还杀害了多少人吗？你只要读读报纸就知道了。巴茨尼呀，塔塔格里亚呀，还有许许多多的人。他们都是在我哥哥的指使之下遭到杀害的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Kay looked into his eyes. "Michael, it's not true, please say it's not true."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="恺逼视着他的眼睛。“迈克尔，这不是真的。请你说，这不是真的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Michael shook his head wearily. "Of course it's not. Just believe me, this one time I'm letting you ask about my affairs, and I'm giving you an answer. It is not true."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈克尔疲惫不堪地摇摇头。“当然不是真的，相信我好了。我让你过问我的事情，同时我也回答你的问题，可就只这一次，这不是真的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Michael shrugged. "She's hysterical."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈克尔耸耸肩。“她患了癔病。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"We both need a drink," she said. She went into the kitchen for ice and while there heard the front door open. She went out of the kitchen and saw Clemenza, Neri and Rocco Lampone come in with the bodyguards. Michael had his back to her, but she moved so that she could see him in profile. At that moment Clemenza addressed her husband, greeting him formally.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“咱们两个都需要喝点酒，”她说。说罢，她就到厨房里去取冰淇淋。她在厨房的时候听到前门开了。她刚从厨房出来就看到克莱门扎、奈里、罗科·拉朋进来了，后面跟了几个保镖。她站在后面只能看到迈克尔的背，于是她走动了一下，如今她可以看到他的侧面。这时，克菜门扎向她丈夫致意，用的是正式称呼。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Don Michael," Clemenza said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“迈克尔老头子，”克莱门扎严肃地说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Kay could see how Michael stood to receive their homage. He reminded her of statues in Rome, statues of those Roman emperors of antiquity, who, by divine right, held the power of life and death over their fellow men. One hand was on his hip, the profile of his face showed a cold proud power, his body was carelessly, arrogantly at ease, weight resting on one foot slightly behind the other. The caporegimes stood before him. In that moment Kay knew that everything Connie had accused Michael of was true. She went back into the kitchen and wept.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="恺可以看清楚迈克尔是怎么站在那儿接受他们的效忠的。他那个样子，使她想起了古罗马皇帝的雕像，那些皇帝凭着君权神授的理论，掌握着他们同胞的生死大权：一只手放在臀部，他面部的侧影显示着一种冷酷的自豪的力量，他的身子采取的是漫不经心的、盛气凌人的“稍息”姿势，重心是放在稍稍错后的一条腿上的，兵团司令们采取“立正”姿势站在他的面前。这时，恺明白了，康妮指责迈克尔所犯的罪行，一桩桩，一件件，全是真的。她回到厨房，哭泣起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He had never been more convincing. He looked directly into her eyes. He was using all the mutual trust they had built up in their married life to make her believe him. And she could not doubt any longer. She smiled at him ruefully and came into his arms for a kiss.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他说话的语气，比以往任何时候都更加令人信服。他直视着她的眼睛。他利用他们夫妇生活中所建立起来的互相信赖的魔力去感动她，让她相信他的话。她不能再怀疑了。她向他苦笑了一下，扑到他的怀里，让他吻了一下。">查看中文翻译</div>
