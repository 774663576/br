<div class="line_en">Barry and Jill stood in the covered walkway by the puzzle lock, breathing the clean night air. Beyond the high walls, the crickets and cicadas hummed their ceaseless song, a soothing reminder that there was still a sane world outside.</div>

<div class="line_en">Jill's brush with disaster had left her light-headed and somewhat nauseous, and Barry had gently led her to the back door, suggesting that the fresh air would do her good. He hadn't found Chris or Wesker, though he seemed certain that they were still alive. He brought her up to speed quickly, retracing his meandering path through the house as Jill leaned against the wall, still taking deep breaths of the warm air.</div>

<div class="line_en">Jill smiled back gratefully, nodding, but noticed that he seemed a little… strained, the humor forced.</div>

<div class="line_en">She nodded again, thinking of how close she'd come to dying. She shivered slightly, then forced the thoughts away; they needed to be concentrating on Chris and Wesker. "So you do think they're still alive?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔再次点头，脑海里又回想起刚才那个生死关头。浑身有些轻微的颤抖，于是急忙不再去想。现在有必要认真地考虑一下关于克里斯和威斯克的事情了。“那么，你认为他们两个还活着么？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I hope I can return the favor if you ever get in a tight spot," she said softly. "Really. You saved my life."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="巴瑞冲着镶嵌在墙壁里面的金属控制台点了点头，说道：“那个有星星标记的徽章是从一开始就有的吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yeah. Besides the shell casings, there was a whole trail of those ghouls in the other wing, all with clean head shots; gotta be Chris -- though I had to splatter a couple more of 'em upstairs, so I figure he holed up somewhere along the way."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“啊，在别墅对面的那一侧，我发现了几个空弹壳，还有一些丧尸的尸体。那些家伙的脑袋全部被轰飞了，从手法上看应该是克里斯干的。所以我觉得那小子应该藏在某个地方了吧…”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jill frowned, a little surprised at the abrupt change of topic; Chris was one of Barry's closest friends. "No. I found it in another room with a trap. This place seems to be full of them. In fact, maybe we should look for Wesker and Chris together -- no telling what they might've stumbled into, or what else could happen to either of us."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔皱了皱眉，对于巴瑞突然将话题转移而感到有些吃惊。克里斯可是巴瑞最好的朋友，可是现在他却显得有些漠不关心。“不，那个是我在其他的房间里找到的。别墅里到处都有这种机关。所以我觉得我们还是先把威斯克和克里斯找到比较好，不然的话，他们也许会碰到刚才那种情况，同时他们也不知道我们这边发生了什么事情。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Though his demeanor didn't change, Jill had the sudden distinct impression that Barry was uncomfortable. He had turned away to study the copper diagram, but it almost seemed as if he was trying to avoid eye contact.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽然巴瑞的态度没有改变，但吉尔突然感到对方有些心神不宁。尽管他是为了查看控制台面转过身去，但实际上好像是为了避开自己的目光。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Besides," he said, "we know what we're up against now. As long as we use a little common sense, we'll be fine."</div>

<div class="line_en">Barry shook his head. "I don't know. I mean, you're right, we should watch our step, but there are a lot of rooms, and our first priority ought to be securing an escape. If we split up, we can try to find the rest of these crests, and look for Chris at the same time. And Wesker."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="巴瑞摇头说道：“你说得很对，我们一定要小心。但是这里的房间太多了，我们当初的目的就是从这瑞安全撤出。两个人分头行动的话，一来能够找到剩下的徽章，二来也可以发现克里斯或者是威斯克。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jill nodded, but she couldn't shake the feeling that there was more to it than that. Since he'd pulled her out of the trap he'd been acting unusually subdued, even nervous.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔虽然点头表示理解，但还是觉得巴瑞一定隐暪了一些其他的事情，这种想法在她脑海中挥之不去。虽说巴瑞将她从死亡的天花板底下拽了出来，可是此刻他自己却被一种异样的感觉所控制，令人感到不安。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He sighed, finally looking at her. He did seem tired; there were dark circles under his eyes, and his wide shoulders were slumped.</div>

<div class="line_en">And it sounded like he already had a pretty good idea of the mansion's layout, so it wasn't like he needed the information.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="而且巴瑞好像对这间别墅的布局也很了解，所以没有必要给他情报…">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jill knew she was probably being overly suspiCious, but all the same, she decided to keep her mouth shut about Trent's computer. After all she'd been through, she wasn't feeling particularly trusting.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔觉得自己有些疑神疑鬼，但是不管怎样，关于特兰特的计算机一事是绝对不会对其他人透露的。结果自始至终果然谁都不能相信。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jill scoffed inwardly as she pushed herself away from the wall and she and Barry walked slowly back toward the house. Now that was paranoid.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“真是的，我可能是得了忘想症了吧。”吉尔离开墙壁，站直了身体，一边在心里自嘲，一边随着巴瑞返回到别墅。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Paranoid much? This is Barry Burton you're talking about, the backbone of the Raccoon S. T. A. R. S. -- not to mention, the man who just saved your life. What could he possibly be hiding?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这只不过是我的错觉吧？他可是巴瑞·波顿啊，浣熊市S.T。A.R。S的顶梁柱，同时还是刚刚救了自己一命的恩人。这样的男人也会做一些鬼鬼崇崇的事情吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That's it, keep rationalizing. Next thing, you'll be suspecting Captain Wesker of planning this whole thing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那么接下来，制定这个作战计划的威斯克队长就变得很可疑了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They stopped as they reached the door, Jill taking a few final lungfuls of the sweet air, letting it settle her nerves. Barry had taken out his Colt Python and was reloading the empty chambers, his expression grim. "I thought I'd go back over to the east wing, see if I can pick up Chris's trail," he said. "Why don't you head upstairs and start looking for the other crests? That way we can cover all of the rooms, work our way back to the main hall."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两人来到门边停下了脚步，吉尔最后用力地吸了一口新鲜空气，同时稳了稳心神。巴瑞掏出柯尔特，装填好子弹后微微一笑：“我回到别墅东侧，沿着克里斯所留下的痕迹寻找他。你去二楼，试着找到剩下的几枚徽章，怎么样？咱们俩分头寻找，将所有的房间都搜索一遍之后，最终在正门大厅会合…”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Good luck," he said, and before she could respond, he turned and hurried away, weapon in hand. With another creak of ancient metal, he slipped through the double doors at the end of the hall and was gone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="说完这句话后，还没等吉尔做出反应，巴瑞便握着手枪转身快步离去。不久后，伴随着一声破旧的金属声，他的身影消失在走廊尽头的那扇门里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You're gonna do fine," Barry said smoothly, placing a warm hand on her shoulder and gently ushering her back inside. As soon as the door closed behind them he lifted his hand in a casual salute, smiling.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“放心，我们不会有事的。”巴瑞说道，并将他那温暖的手搭在吉尔的肩膀上轻一推。门在二人的背后关闭，巴瑞一边微笑，一边敷衍地敬了一个礼。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“虽然这不是一种愉快的推测，但却说明巴瑞的行为的确有问题。他很明显地想要尽快和我一起从这间别墅里逃出去。因此希望我能到别墅西侧进行搜索。另外从他盯着那个密码锁的样来看，巴瑞所关心的事情并不是克里斯和威斯克的所在，而是自己能够逃脱的出口…”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jill straightened her shoulders and walked to the door that led to the stairwell, drawing her weapon. She'd made it this far she could make it a little farther, try to unravel the mystery that had taken the lives of so many or die trying, her mind whispered softly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔活动了一下筋骨，一边走向通往楼梯的门一边掏出手枪。自己已经走到了这里，之后会稍微顺利一些吧。将夺走众多生命的秘密揭露出来——或者被这个秘密夺走生命。吉尔在心里小声说着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Forest Speyer was dead. The laughing, Southern good ol' boy with his ratty clothes and easy grin was no more. That Forest was gone, leaving behind a bloody, lifeless impostor slumped against a wall.</div>

<div class="line_en">Chris stared down at the impostor, the distant sounds of the night lost to a sudden gust of wind that whipped around the eaves, moaning through the railing of the second-story patio. It was a ghostly sound, but Forest couldn't hear it; Forest would never hear anything again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克里斯盯着福斯特的尸体，他能够远远地听到夜风的声音，它们呼啸着穿过二楼中庭的栏杆，这声意就好像是有幽灵出没一般，可是福斯特已经听不到了。他已经什么声音都听不到了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Maybe I should stop thinking about it and do my job. Whether or not we find the others, he's right about needing to get out. We have to get back to the city, let people know what's out here.</div>

<div class="line_en">Forest's body was covered with wounds, most an inch or two across and surrounded by raw, bloody flesh -- it was as if he'd been stabbed hundreds of times with a dull knife, each vicious cut ripping away chunks of skin and muscle. Part of his ribcage was cruelly exposed, slivers of white showing beneath tattered redness. His eyeless, streaming stare was the crowning horror-like the killer hadn't been content to take Forest's life, wanting his soul instead.</div>
