<div class="line_en">The wind was blowing wild from the east, so strong the heavy cage would rock whenever a gust got it in its teeth. It skirled along the Wall, shivering off the ice, making Jon's cloak flap against the bars. The sky was slate grey, the sun no more than a faint patch of brightness behind the clouds. Across the killing ground, he could see the glimmer of a thousand campfires burning, but their lights seemed small and powerless against such gloom and cold.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="风从东方狂野地吹来，沉重的铁笼在它的利齿下摇摆。风沿长城打转，卷起冰面上的气流，使得琼恩的斗篷贴紧栏杆。天空，如板岩一般灰蒙，太阳不过是云层后淡淡的亮斑。沙场彼端，千堆营火摇曳闪烁，但光芒跟这阴暗寒冷的景象相比，显得渺小而无力。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A grim day. Jon Snow wrapped gloved hands around the bars and held tight as the wind hammered at the cage once more. When he looked straight down past his feet, the ground was lost in shadow, as if he were being lowered into some bottomless pit. Well, death is a bottomless pit of sorts, he reflected, and when this day's work is done my name will be shadowed forever.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阴暗的一天。当风再度撞向吊笼，琼恩·雪诺用戴手套的手握住栏杆，抓得紧紧的。他直直地望向脚下，地面迷失在阴影之中，仿佛是个无底洞。死亡就像无底洞，他寻思，今天之后，我的名字将永远蒙上阴影。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Bastard children were born from lust and lies, men said; their nature was wanton and treacherous. Once Jon had meant to prove them wrong, to show his lord father that he could be as good and true a son as Robb. I made a botch of that. Robb had become a hero king; if Jon was remembered at all, it would be as a turncloak, an oathbreaker, and a murderer. He was glad that Lord Eddard was not alive to see his shame.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="人们说，私生子的血脉出自欲望与欺骗，天生便是反复无常，背信弃义。琼恩曾想证明这是错的，证明给他父亲大人看，他也能像罗柏一样当个优秀正直的儿子。结果我表现拙劣。罗柏成为英雄国王；而就算有人记得我琼恩，也只知道我是变色龙、背誓者和谋杀犯。他不禁庆幸艾德公爵没有活着看到他的羞耻。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I should have stayed in that cave with Ygritte. if there was a life beyond this one, he hoped to tell her that. She will claw my face the way the eagle did, and curse me for a coward, but I'll tell her all the same. He flexed his sword hand, as Maester Aemon had taught him. The habit had become part of him, and he would need his fingers to be limber to have even half a chance of murdering Mance Rayder.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我该和耶哥蕊特留在那个山洞里。若死后有知，他希望能告诉她。她大概会像那只鹰一样抓破我的脸，咒骂我是胆小鬼，但我还是要告诉她。他握剑的手开开合合，这曾是伊蒙学士的建议，如今成了他的习惯。毕竟，他需要手指灵活，才可能有一丝机会击杀曼斯·雷德。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They had pulled him out this morning, after four days in the ice, locked up in a cell five by five by five, too low for him to stand, too tight for him to stretch out on his back. The stewards had long ago discovered that food and meat kept longer in the icy storerooms carved from the base of the Wall… but prisoners did not. "You will die in here, Lord Snow," Ser Alliser had said just before he closed the heavy wooden door, and Jon had believed it. But this morning they had come and pulled him out again, and marched him cramped and shivering back to the King's Tower, to stand before jowly Janos Slynt once more.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="今天早晨，他们将他从冰牢里提出，至此，他已在这五尺长、五尺宽、五尺高的冰窖里被锁了四天，里面又矮又窄，既无法站立，也无法躺直。事务官们早就发现，食物和肉类在长城底部挖出的冰窟窿里可以保存很久…但囚犯不行。“你会死在这里面，雪诺大人。”艾里沙爵士关上沉重的木门前说，而琼恩也相信。但今天早晨他们又将他拉了出来，押着他颤抖蹒跚地走回国王塔，再次带到双下巴的杰诺斯·史林特面前。">查看中文翻译</div>

I have decided to give you one last chance to prove you are as loyal as you claim, Lord Snow. One last chance to do your duty, yes!" He stood. "Mance Rayder wants to parley with us. He knows he has no chance now that Janos Slynt has come, so he wants to talk, this Kingbeyond-the-Wall. But the man is craven, and will not come to us. No doubt he knows I'd hang him. Hang him by his feet from the top of the Wall, on a rope two hundred feet long! But he will not come. He asks that we send an envoy to him."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="这话错得太离谱，琼恩差点笑出声来。“你完全搞反了。曼斯打一开始就怀疑我，如果我再穿着黑斗篷出现在他营地，代表守夜人发言，他毫无疑问会把我当成反复无常的叛徒，不可信赖。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When the cage jerked to a halt, Jon swung down onto the ground and rattled Longclaw's hilt to loosen the bastard blade in its scabbard. The gate was a few yards to his left, still blocked by the splintered ruins of the turtle, the carcass of a mammoth ripening within. There were other corpses too, strewn amidst broken barrels, hardened pitch, and patches of burnt grass, all shadowed by the Wall. Jon had no wish to linger here. He started walking toward the wildling camp, past the body of a dead giant whose head had been crushed by a stone. A raven was pulling out bits of brain from the giant's shattered skull. It looked up as he walked by. "Snow," it screamed at him. "Snow, snow" Then it opened its wings and flew away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吊笼猛地停住，琼恩摇摇摆摆地走下地面，然后“咔嗒”一声松开长爪剑鞘的搭扣。城门在左边几码之外，仍被龟盾的残骸堵塞，一头长毛象的尸体在里面腐烂。这里还有其他尸体，散布在碎木桶、凝固沥青和烧焦的草地之间，被长城的阴影所遮盖。琼恩向野人营地走去，不想在此逗留，途经一个巨人的尸体，他的脑袋被石头砸碎，一只乌鸦正从碎裂的头骨当中一点点啄出脑浆。经过时，乌鸦抬头看他。“雪诺，”它朝他嘶叫，“雪诺，雪诺。”然后展翅飞走。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The wind whistled through the bars, and Jon Snow shivered. His leg was throbbing, and his head. He was not fit to kill a kitten, yet here he was. The trap had teeth. With Maester Aemon insisting on Jon's innocence, Lord Janos had not dared to leave him in the ice to die. This was better. "Our honor means no more than our lives, so long as the realm is safe," Qhorin Halfhand had said in the Frostfangs. He must remember that. Whether he slew Mance or only tried and failed, the free folk would kill him. Even desertion was impossible, if he'd been so inclined; to Mance he was a proven liar and betrayer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="风从栏杆之间呼啸而过，琼恩·雪诺打个冷颤。腿阵阵抽痛，头也一样。他虚弱到杀猫都难，然而还是得去完成使命。这是个狰狞的陷阱。由于伊蒙学士坚持琼恩的清白，杰诺斯大人不敢将他留在冰牢里等死，只能假敌人之手。“我们将生命与荣耀献给守夜人，只为维护王国安泰。”‘断掌’科林在霜雪之牙上如是说。他必须记住这句话。反正不管刺杀曼斯成败与否，他都会被自由民处死。想再叛逃也不可能；毕竟在曼斯眼里，他已成了不折不扣的骗子和变色龙。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mance shook his head. "The Others never come when the sun is up." Chariots were rattling across the killing ground, jammed with riders waving spears of sharpened bone. The king groaned. "Where the bloody hell do they think they're going? Quenn, get those fools back where they belong. Someone bring my horse. The mare, not the stallion. I'll want my armor too." Mance glanced suspiciously at the Wall. Atop the icy parapets, the straw soldiers stood collecting arrows, but there was no sign of any other activity. "Harma, mount up your raiders. Tormund, find your sons and give me a triple line of spears."</div>

<div class="line_en">"If you're lying to me again, you won't be leaving here alive," Mance warned. His guards brought him his horse and armor. Elsewhere around the camp, Jon saw people running at cross purposes, some men forming up as if to storm the Wall while others slipped into the woods, women driving dog carts east, mammoths wandering west. He reached back over his shoulder and drew Longclaw just as a thin line of rangers emerged from the fringes of the wood three hundred yards away.

<div class="line_en">Trumpets were blowing all around, loud and brazen. The wildlings have no trumpets, only warhorns. They knew that as well as he did; the sound sent free folk running in confusion, some toward the fighting, others away. A mammoth was stomping through a flock of sheep that three men were trying to herd off west. The drums were beating as the wildlings ran to form squares and lines, but they were too late, too disorganized, too slow. The enemy was emerging from the forest, from the east, the northeast, the north; three great columns of heavy horse, all dark glinting steel and bright wool surcoats. Not the men of Eastwatch, those had been no more than a line of scouts. An army. The king? Jon was as confused as the wildlings. Could Robb have returned? Had the boy on the iron Throne finally bestirred himself? "You best get back inside the tent," he told Val.</div>

<div class="line_en">Across the field one column had washed over Harma Dogshead. Another smashed into the flank of Tormund's spearmen as he and his sons desperately tried to turn them. The giants were climbing onto their mammoths, though, and the knights on their barded horses did not like that at all; he could see how the coursers and destriers screamed and scattered at the sight of those lumbering mountains. But there was fear on the wildling side as well, hundreds of women and children rushing away from the battle, some of them blundering right under the hooves of garrons. He saw an old woman's dog cart veer into the path of three chariots, to send them crashing into each other.</div>

He saw a mammoth pluck a knight from his saddle and fling him forty feet with a flick of its trunk.

<div class="line_en">East and north and northeast, he saw bands of wildlings trying to stand and fight, but the attackers rode right over them. The free folk still had the numbers, but the attackers had steel armor and heavy horses. in the thickest part of the fray, Jon saw Mance standing tall in his stirrups. His red-and-black cloak and raven-winged helm made him easy to pick out. He had his sword raised and men were rallying to him when a wedge of knights smashed into them with lance and sword and longaxe. Mance's mare went up on her hind legs, kicking, and a spear took her through the breast. Then the steel tide washed over him.</div>

<div class="line_en">It's done, Jon thought, they're breaking. The wildlings were running, throwing down their weapons, Hornfoot men and cave dwellers and Thenns in bronze scales, they were running. Mance was gone, someone was waving Harma's head on a pole, Tormund's lines had broken. Only the giants on their mammoths were holding, hairy islands in a red steel sea. The fires were leaping from tent to tent and some of the tall pines were going up as well. And through the smoke another wedge of armored riders came, on barded horses. Floating above them were the largest banners yet, royal standards as big as sheets; a yellow one with long pointed tongues that showed a flaming heart, and another like a sheet of beaten gold, with a black stag prancing and rippling in the wind.</div>
