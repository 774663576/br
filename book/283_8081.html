<div class="line_en">Harriet was a little distressed -- did look a little foolish at first: but having once owned that she had been presumptuous and silly, and self-deceived, before, her pain and confusion seemed to die away with the words, and leave her without a care for the past, and with the fullest exultation in the present and future; for, as to her friend's approbation, Emma had instantly removed every fear of that nature, by meeting her with the most unqualified congratulations.-- Harriet was most happy to give every particular of the evening at Astley's, and the dinner the next day; she could dwell on it all with the utmost delight. But what did such particulars explain?-- The fact was, as Emma could now acknowledge, that Harriet had always liked Robert Martin; and that his continuing to love her had been irresistible.-- Beyond this, it must ever be unintelligible to Emma.</div>

<div class="line_en">If Emma had still, at intervals, an anxious feeling for Harriet, a momentary doubt of its being possible for her to be really cured of her attachment to Mr. Knightley, and really able to accept another man from unbiased inclination, it was not long that she had to suffer from the recurrence of any such uncertainty. A very few days brought the party from London, and she had no sooner an opportunity of being one hour alone with Harriet, than she became perfectly satisfied -- unaccountable as it was!-- that Robert Martin had thoroughly supplanted Mr. Knightley, and was now forming all her views of happiness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果说爱玛有时还为哈丽特担心，偶尔也怀疑她是否真的不再思恋奈特利先生，是否真的心甘情愿答应嫁给另一个人，那她没过多久就不再这样琢磨不定了。只过了几天，那伙人就从伦敦来了。她与哈丽特单独待了一个小时，她就完全置信不疑了——尽避事情令人难以理解！罗伯特·马丁先生已经完全取代了奈特利先生，现正渐渐成为她全部的幸福构想。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The event, however, was most joyful; and every day was giving her fresh reason for thinking so.-- Harriet's parentage became known. She proved to be the daughter of a tradesman, rich enough to afford her the comfortable maintenance which had ever been hers, and decent enough to have always wished for concealment.-- Such was the blood of gentility which Emma had formerly been so ready to vouch for!-- It was likely to be as untainted, perhaps, as the blood of many a gentleman: but what a connexion had she been preparing for Mr. Knightley -- or for the Churchills -- or even for Mr. Elton!-- The stain of illegitimacy, unbleached by nobility or wealth, would have been a stain indeed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，这还真是一桩大喜事，她每天都有理由感到高兴。哈丽特的家世已经打听出来了。原来，她是一个商人的女儿，那商人挺有钱，能供她维持以往那种舒适生活。他还挺顾面子，一直都想掩饰这层关系。爱玛早就认定她出身于富贵人家，现在果然如此！她的身世也许就像许多上等人一样清白无瑕。可是，她想攀附的奈特利先生也好——邱吉尔先生家也罢——甚至还包括埃尔顿先生，他们都是什么样的人啊！私生女的污点，要是没有金钱地位来粉饰，那还真是一大污点呢。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">No objection was raised on the father's side; the young man was treated liberally; it was all as it should be: and as Emma became acquainted with Robert Martin, who was now introduced at Hartfield, she fully acknowledged in him all the appearance of sense and worth which could bid fairest for her little friend. She had no doubt of Harriet's happiness with any good-tempered man; but with him, and in the home he offered, there would be the hope of more, of security, stability, and improvement. She would be placed in the midst of those who loved her, and who had better sense than herself; retired enough for safety, and occupied enough for cheerfulness. She would be never led into temptation, nor left for it to find her out. She would be respectable and happy; and Emma admitted her to be the luckiest creature in the world, to have created so steady and persevering an affection in such a man;-- or, if not quite the luckiest, to yield only to herself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那做父亲的没有提出什么异议，年轻人受到了宽待。一切都很正常：罗伯特·马丁傍介绍到哈特菲尔德，爱玛跟他越来越熟悉，发现他看上去头脑聪明，品德也好，完全配得上她的小朋友。她相信哈丽特嫁给任何一个性情温柔的人，都能获得幸福，而跟马丁生活在一起，住在他们家，她会越发幸福，又平安又稳定，还能不断进步。她置身于既爱她又比她有头脑的人们中间，闲着觉得平安，忙起来感到愉快。她决不会受到，别人也不会让她受到。她会受人尊重，生活得非常幸福。爱玛承认她是世界上最幸福的人，赢得了这样一个男人忠贞不渝的爱情。或者说，即便不是最幸运，那也不过是仅仅不如她爱玛幸运罢了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harriet, necessarily drawn away by her engagements with the Martins, was less and less at Hartfield; which was not to be regretted.-- The intimacy between her and Emma must sink; their friendship must change into a calmer sort of goodwill; and, fortunately, what ought to be, and must be, seemed already beginning, and in the most gradual, natural manner.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈丽特必然要常常跑到马丁家，因而来哈特菲尔德的次数也就越来越少，这倒没什么好遗憾的。她和爱玛的亲密关系只能淡漠下去，她们的友谊只能变成一种冷静的友情。所幸的是，应该的事，必须做的事，似乎都已经开了头，而且是以极其自然的方式慢慢进行的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Before the end of September, Emma attended Harriet to church, and saw her hand bestowed on Robert Martin with so complete a satisfaction, as no remembrances, even connected with Mr. Elton as he stood before them, could impair.-- Perhaps, indeed, at that time she scarcely saw Mr. Elton, but as the clergyman whose blessing at the altar might next fall on herself.-- Robert Martin and Harriet Smith, the latest couple engaged of the three, were the first to be married.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="九月底，爱玛陪哈丽特上教堂，满怀喜悦地眼见她嫁给了罗伯特·马丁，回首往事，甚至想起同站在他们面前的埃尔顿先生有关的事情，都无损于这种喜悦。也许，他当时并没他看作埃尔顿先生，而是把他看做下次可能在祭坛上为她祝福的牧师。在三对情侣中，罗伯特·马丁和哈丽特·史密斯是最后订婚的一对，却首先结了婚。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The intermediate month was the one fixed on, as far as they dared, by Emma and Mr. Knightley.-- They had determined that their marriage ought to be concluded while John and Isabella were still at Hartfield, to allow them the fortnight's absence in a tour to the seaside, which was the plan.-- John and Isabella, and every other friend, were agreed in approving it. But Mr. Woodhouse -- how was Mr. Woodhouse to be induced to consent?-- he, who had never yet alluded to their marriage but as a distant event.</div>

<div class="line_en">When first sounded on the subject, he was so miserable, that they were almost hopeless.-- A second allusion, indeed, gave less pain.-- He began to think it was to be, and that he could not prevent it -- a very promising step of the mind on its way to resignation. Still, however, he was not happy. Nay, he appeared so much otherwise, that his daughter's courage failed. She could not bear to see him suffering, to know him fancying himself neglected; and though her understanding almost acquiesced in the assurance of both the Mr. Knightleys, that when once the event were over, his distress would be soon over too, she hesitated -- she could not proceed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第一次探他的口气时，他黯然神伤，他们俩都以为这件事简直没有指望了。第二次提起时，他就不那么痛苦了。他觉得势在必行，他也阻挡不了——这是他思上朝认可的方向迈出的可喜的一步。不过，他还是不高兴。是呀，他看样子是不大高兴，做女儿的都泄气了。眼看着父亲痛苦，让他觉得自己受冷落了，爱玛真是于心不忍。奈特利先生兄弟俩都叫她放心，说事情一过去，他的苦恼也就马上结束了，虽说她心里也同意这个看法，但她还是迟疑不决——不敢贸然行事。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The result of this distress was, that, with a much more voluntary, cheerful consent than his daughter had ever presumed to hope for at the moment, she was able to fix her wedding-day -- and Mr. Elton was called on, within a month from the marriage of Mr. and Mrs. Robert Martin, to join the hands of Mr. Knightley and Miss Woodhouse.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这一苦恼导致的结果是：做父亲的同意了女儿的婚事，那个爽快劲儿大大超出了女儿当时的期望，因而女儿得以定下了婚期——罗伯特·马丁夫妇结婚后不到一个月，埃尔顿先生又被请来，为奈特利先生和伍德豪斯小姐举行了婚礼。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In this state of suspense they were befriended, not by any sudden illumination of Mr. Woodhouse's mind, or any wonderful change of his nervous system, but by the operation of the same system in another way.-- Mrs. Weston's poultry-house was robbed one night of all her turkeys -- evidently by the ingenuity of man. Other poultry-yards in the neighbourhood also suffered.-- Pilfering was housebreaking to Mr. Woodhouse's fears.-- He was very uneasy; and but for the sense of his son-in-law's protection, would have been under wretched alarm every night of his life. The strength, resolution, and presence of mind of the Mr. Knightleys, commanded his fullest dependence. While either of them protected him and his, Hartfield was safe.-- But Mr. John Knightley must be in London again by the end of the first week in November.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在这悬而未决的时候，他们的好运来了，倒不是伍德豪斯先生突然心明眼亮了，也不是他的神经系统发生了神奇的变化，而是他的这一系统产生了另一个烦恼。一天夜里，韦斯顿太太家禽房里的火鸡全给偷走了——显然是很有手段的人干的。附近一带另外一些禽栏也蒙受了损失。伍德豪斯先生心怀恐惧，认为偷窃跟破门而人没有什么两样。他坐卧不安，要不是感到有女婿保护，这辈子真要天天夜里胆战心惊。奈特利兄弟俩强健有力，果断镇定，他完全可以信赖。他们俩只要有一个保护他和他家，哈特菲尔德就会平安无事。可是，约翰·奈特利先生到十一月的第一个周末非得回伦敦不可。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The wedding was very much like other weddings, where the parties have no taste for finery or parade; and Mrs. Elton, from the particulars detailed by her husband, thought it all extremely shabby, and very inferior to her own.--"Very little white satin, very few lace veils; a most pitiful business!-- Selina would stare when she heard of it."-- But, in spite of these deficiencies, the wishes, the hopes, the confidence, the predictions of the small band of true friends who witnessed the ceremony, were fully answered in the perfect happiness of the union.</div>
