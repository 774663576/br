<div class="line_en">I've never met my Swiss grandparents. I don't know their names or anything about them. I do know my dad has an older sister, but I've never met her, either. I know that he worked as a chef in Montreal and New York for a while before moving to South Africa in the late 1970s. I know that he worked for an industrial food-service company and that he opened a couple of bars and restaurants here and there. That's about it.</div>

<div class="line_en">While I know nothing of my dad's life before me, thanks to my mom and just from the time I have been able to spend with him, I do have a sense of who he is as a person. He's very Swiss, clean and particular and precise. He's the only person I know who checks into a hotel room and leaves it cleaner than when he arrived. He doesn't like anyone waiting on him. No servants, no housekeepers. He cleans up after himself. He likes his space. He lives in his own world and does his own everything.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽然我并不了解他之前的生活，但通过我母亲，以及我能够和他在一起相处的有限时光，我大概了解他是怎样一个人。他是典型的瑞士人，整洁、挑剔、精确。他是我见过的唯一一个去住酒店，但离开的时候，房间反倒比入住前还干净的人。他不喜欢别人服侍他。在他的世界里，不要服务生，不要管家，他自己做清洁。他喜欢自己的空间。他活在自己的世界里，自己解决所有问题。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">One thing I do know about my dad is that he hates racism and homogeneity more than anything, and not because of any feelings of self-righteousness or moral superiority. He just never understood how white people could be racist in South Africa. "Africa is full of black people," he would say. "So why would you come all the way to Africa if you hate black people? If you hate black people so much, why did you move into their house?" To him it was insane.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我很了解我父亲的一点是，他极度痛恨种族主义和族群同质计划，而且他痛恨的理由并非出于伪善或道德优越感。他只是不理解，南非的白人凭什么要歧视本地的黑人。“南非全是黑人，你要是那么讨厌黑人的话，你为什么还大老远来南非？如果你那么讨厌黑人，为什么要搬来他们的家乡住？”对他来说，这简直蠢到家了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I know that he never married. He used to say that most people marry because they want to control another person, and he never wanted to be controlled. I know that he loves traveling, loves entertaining, having people over. But at the same time his privacy is everything to him. Wherever he lives he's never listed in the phone book. I'm sure my parents would have been caught in their time together if he hadn't been as private as he is. My mom was wild and impulsive. My father was reserved and rational. She was fire, he was ice. They were opposites that attracted, and I am a mix of them both.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我知道他从没结过婚。他曾经说，大多数人结婚是为了控制另一个人，但他不希望被任何人控制。我知道他喜欢旅行，喜欢娱乐，喜欢聚会。但与此同时，他的隐私又是一等一的大事。无论他住在哪儿，他的名字都不会被列在电话簿上。我敢肯定，如果他要没有这么注重隐私，他和我母亲交往的时候肯定会被逮到。我妈妈热情而冲动，我爸爸保守而理智。她是火，他是冰。他们两个因为彼此的对立面而相互吸引，我则是他们二人的中和体。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Because racism never made sense to my father, he never subscribed to any of the rules of apartheid. In the early eighties, before I was born, he opened one of the first integrated restaurants in Johannesburg, a steakhouse. He applied for a special license that allowed businesses to serve both black and white patrons. These licenses existed because hotels and restaurants needed them to serve black travelers and diplomats from other countries, who in theory weren't subject to the same restrictions as black South Africans; black South Africans with money in turn exploited that loophole to frequent those hotels and restaurants.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="由于我父亲觉得种族主义毫无道理，他也就没有遵守任何种族隔离的法规。在80年代早期，我出生之前，他在约翰内斯堡开了一家牛排店，是当年第一批可以为多种族人群提供服务的餐厅之一。他申请了那种可以同时为黑人及白人提供服务的特殊执照。这种执照之所以存在，是因为酒店和餐馆需要招待黑人旅行者，或其他国家的黑人大使，这类人理论上不会像南非本地黑人那样受到限制，所以南非本地有钱的黑人就抓住这个漏洞，去这类酒店和餐馆消费。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">My dad's restaurant was an instant, booming success. Black people came because there were few upscale establishments where they could eat, and they wanted to come and sit in a nice restaurant and see what that was like. White people came because they wanted to see what it was like to sit with black people. The white people would sit and watch the black people eat, and the black people would sit and eat and watch the white people watching them eat. The curiosity of being together overwhelmed the animosity keeping people apart. The place had a great vibe.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我父亲的餐馆立刻火了。黑人喜欢来，因为他们能去的高规格餐厅实在太少，而他们又很想去高档餐厅体验一下那是什么感觉。白人也喜欢来，因为他们想感受下和黑人坐在一起进餐是什么感觉。白人会来餐厅里坐着，看黑人吃饭，黑人会来餐厅坐着，一边吃一边看白人在旁边看他们吃。对于共处一室的好奇，胜过了将人们隔离开的仇恨。那地方的氛围特别好。">查看中文翻译</div>

They filed petitions, and the government started looking for ways to shut my dad down. At first the inspectors came and tried to get him on cleanliness and health-code violations. Clearly they had never heard of the Swiss. That failed dismally. Then they decided to go after him by imposing additional and arbitrary restrictions.</div>

<div class="line_en">After apartheid fell, my father moved from Hillbrow to Yeoville, a formerly quiet, residential neighborhood that had transformed into this vibrant melting pot of black and white and every other hue. Immigrants were pouring in from Nigeria and Ghana and all over the continent, bringing different food and exciting music. Rockey Street was the main strip, and its sidewalks were filled with street vendors and restaurants and bars. It was an explosion of culture.</div>

<div class="line_en">My father and I lived on a schedule. I visited him every Sunday afternoon. Even though apartheid had ended, my mom had made her decision: She didn't want to get married. So we had our house, and he had his. I'd made a deal with my mom that if I went with her to mixed church and white church in the morning, after that I'd get to skip black church and go to my dad's, where we'd watch Formula 1 racing instead of casting out demons.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我和父亲按日程见面。我每周日下午去看他。尽管种族隔离结束了，但我妈妈心意已决：她不想结婚。所以我和妈妈有我们的家，父亲有他自己的家。我和妈妈做了约定，早晨我和她一起去混合种族教会和白人教会，之后我就不跟她去黑人教会了，不用参加驱魔仪式，而是去父亲家，和他一起看一级方程式赛车比赛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">My dad lived two blocks over from Rockey, on Yeo Street, right next to this incredible park where I loved to go because kids of all races and different countries were running around and playing there. My dad's house was simple. Nice, but nothing fancy. I feel like my dad had enough money to be comfortable and travel, but he never spent lavishly on things. He's extremely frugal, the kind of guy who drives the same car for twenty years.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我父亲住尤尔路上，与洛基路相隔两个街区，紧挨着一个特别棒的公园，我很爱去那里，因为各个国家的各个种族的小孩，都会在那里跑来跑去玩耍。我父亲的房子布置很简单，是个很舒服的地方，没有什么华丽的装饰。我觉得我爸爸有足够的钱供他生活和旅行，但他从来不会大肆花钱买什么东西。他极度节俭，是那种一辆车能开二十年的人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I celebrated my birthday with my dad every year, and we spent Christmas with him as well. I loved Christmas with my dad because my dad celebrated European Christmas. European Christmas was the best Christmas ever. My dad went all out. He had Christmas lights and a Christmas tree. He had fake snow and snow globes and stockings hung by the fireplace and lots of wrapped presents from Santa Claus. African Christmas was a lot more practical. We'd go to church, come home, have a nice meal with good meat and lots of custard and jelly. But there was no tree. You'd get a present, but it was usually just clothes, a new outfit. You might get a toy, but it wasn't wrapped and it was never from Santa Claus. The whole issue of Santa Claus is a rather contentious one when it comes to African Christmas, a matter of pride. When an African dad buys his kid a present, the last thing he's going to do is give some fat white man credit for it. African Dad will tell you straight up, "No, no, no. I bought you that."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="每年的生日父亲都会陪我一起过，我们也和他一起过圣诞节。我很爱和父亲一起过圣诞节，因为他过的是欧洲圣诞节，而欧洲圣诞节是世界上最棒的圣诞节。我父亲会铆足干劲，全力以赴。他会准备圣诞彩灯、圣诞树，还会在壁炉边装饰上假雪、雪花球以及长袜，还有好多圣诞老人送来的用彩纸包好的礼物。相比之下，非洲圣诞节就要实际得多。我们会去教堂，回家，吃一顿大餐，有肉，有好多的奶冻和果冻，但是没有圣诞树。你也会收到礼物，但通常就是一套新衣服。你也可能会收到一个玩具，但是并不会用包装纸包好，也从来不是圣诞老人送来的。非洲圣诞节对于圣诞老人这件事是有争议的，这关乎荣誉。如果一个非洲父亲给自己的小孩买了个礼物，他才不会把功劳归功于那个白人胖子。非洲父亲会直截了当地告诉你：“不不不，是我给你买的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Outside of birthdays and special occasions, all we had were our Sunday afternoons. He would cook for me. He'd ask me what I wanted, and I'd always request the exact same meal, a German dish called Rösti, which is basically a pancake made out of potatoes and some sort of meat with a gravy. I'd have that and a bottle of Sprite, and for dessert a plastic container of custard with caramel on top.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="除了过生日或一些特殊场合，我们唯一的相处时光就是周日的下午。他会给我做饭，会问我想吃什么，我总是给出一样的回答，一道叫罗斯蒂的德国菜，基本就是用土豆和肉做的薄饼，浇上肉汁。我会吃掉一盘罗斯蒂，配上一瓶雪碧，饭后甜点是塑料盒装的焦糖奶冻。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A good chunk of those afternoons would pass in silence. My dad didn't talk much. He was caring and devoted, attentive to detail, always a card on my birthday, always my favorite food and toys when I came for a visit. But at the same time he was a closed book. We'd talk about the food he was making, talk about the F1 racing we'd watched. Every now and then he'd drop a tidbit of information, about a place he'd visited or his steakhouse. But that was it. Being with my dad was like watching a web series. I'd get a few minutes of information a few minutes at a time, then I'd have to wait a week for the next installment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那些周日下午的大部分时间都很安静。我爸爸不太说话。他很关心我，全身心地为我，并且执着于细节，我过生日时，总会收到他的贺卡，每次我去看他时，他总会准备好我最爱吃的食物，还会给我买玩具。但与此同时，他又像是一本合上的书。我们会讨论他做的食物，讨论我们正在看的一级方程式赛车。时不时地，他会讲一点儿他人生中的小花边儿，关于他去过的地方，关于他的牛排店，但也仅限于此。和我爸相处起来就像在看连续剧，在这几分钟里面，我了解到一点儿信息，但一次就这几分钟，我要等一周才能知道后面发生了什么。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When I was thirteen my dad moved to Cape Town, and we lost touch. We'd been losing touch for a while, for a couple of reasons. I was a teenager. I had a whole other world I was dealing with now. Videogames and computers meant more to me than spending time with my parents. Also, my mom had married Abel. He was incensed by the idea of my mom being in contact with her previous love, and she decided it was safer for everyone involved not to test his anger. I went from seeing my dad every Sunday to seeing him every other Sunday, maybe once a month, whenever my mom could sneak me over, same as she'd done back in Hillbrow. We'd gone from living under apartheid to living under another kind of tyranny, that of an abusive, alcoholic man.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我12岁的时候，父亲搬去了开普敦，我们就此失去了联系。在他搬离之前，我们已经有段时间没联系了，那是由于一系列原因造成的。我那时还是个少年。整个世界在我面前等着我去探索。游戏和电脑对我来说比和父母相处重要得多。另外，我的母亲再婚了，嫁给了亚伯。而一旦知道我母亲居然和前任还有联络，亚伯就会暴跳如雷，所以我母亲决定我们都不要主动去激怒他，这样才比较安全。我从每周日去见父亲一次，变成每隔一周去一次，或者一个月去一次，这取决于我母亲能否把我偷偷地送过去，就好像她以前在希尔布洛住的时候那样。我们从生活在种族隔离的限制之下，转变为生活在一个爱施暴的酒鬼的专制之下。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then he was gone. I stayed busy living my life, surviving high school, surviving my early twenties, becoming a comedian. My career took off quickly. I got a radio DJ gig and hosted a kids' adventure reality show on television. I was headlining at clubs all over the country. But even as my life was moving forward, the questions about my dad were always there in the back of my mind, bubbling up to the surface now and then. "I wonder where he is. Does he think about me? Does he know what I'm doing? Is he proud of me?" When a parent is absent, you're left in the lurch of not knowing, and it's so easy to fill that space with negative thoughts. "They don't care." "They're selfish." My one saving grace was that my mom never spoke ill of him. She would always compliment him. "You're good with your money. You get that from your dad." "You have your dad's smile." "You're clean and tidy like your father." I never turned to bitterness, because she made sure I knew his absence was because of circumstance and not a lack of love. She always told me the story of her coming home from the hospital and my dad saying, "Where's my kid? I want that kid in my life." She'd say to me, "Don't ever forget: He chose you." And, ultimately, when I turned twenty-four, it was my mom who made me track him down.</div>

If he wasn't seeing me, he had no reason to stay, so he left. His leaving wasn't anything traumatic, because it never registered that we might lose touch and never see each other again.

My memories of him felt just out of reach. I was trying to remember how he spoke, how he laughed, what his manner was. I parked on his street and started looking for his address. Camps Bay is full of older, semiretired white people, and as I walked down the road all these old white men were walking toward me and past me. My father was pushing seventy by that point, and I was so afraid I'd forgotten what he looked like. I was looking in the face of every old white man who passed me, like, Are you my daddy? Basically it looked like I was cruising old white dudes in a beachfront retirement community.

<div class="line_en">We picked up right where we'd left off, which was him treating me exactly the way he'd treated me as a thirteen-year-old boy. Like the creature of habit he was, my father went straight back into it. "Right! So where were we? Here, I've got all your favorites. Potato Rösti. A bottle of Sprite. Custard with caramel." Luckily my tastes hadn't matured much since the age of thirteen, so I tucked right in.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们从中断的地方立刻重新建立了联系，他对待我的方式和对待当年那个13岁的小男孩的方式一模一样。我的父亲是个保持一贯习惯的人，这次也不例外。“好的，我们该干什么了？我给你准备了你最爱吃的土豆罗斯蒂、雪碧和焦糖奶冻。”幸好我的口味和13岁时没有太大差别，我立刻大口吃了起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">While I was eating he got up and went and picked up this book, an oversized photo album, and brought it back to the table. "I've been following you," he said, and he opened it up. It was a scrapbook of everything I had ever done, every time my name was mentioned in a newspaper, everything from magazine covers to the tiniest club listings, from the beginning of my career all the way through to that week. He was smiling so big as he took me through it, looking at the headlines. "Trevor Noah Appearing This Saturday at the Blues Room." "Trevor Noah Hosting New TV Show."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我在吃的时候，他起身去拿了一个夹子过来，是一本超大的相册。他把它放到桌上，一边摊开一边说：“我一直在关注着你。”这是一本剪贴簿，里面有我做过的所有事情，报纸上每次提到我的名字，杂志上每次出现我的消息，哪怕是一条微不足道的俱乐部节目清单，从我职业生涯开始的那天直到这周的消息，全在里面。他带着我翻看，脸上露出大大的微笑，指着标题：“特雷弗·诺亚将会于周六在蓝屋俱乐部登台。”或者：“特雷弗·诺亚主持了新节目。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I felt a flood of emotions rushing through me. It was everything I could do not to start crying. It felt like this ten-year gap in my life closed right up in an instant, like only a day had passed since I'd last seen him. For years I'd had so many questions. Is he thinking about me? Does he know what I'm doing? Is he proud of me? But he'd been with me the whole time. He'd always been proud of me. Circumstance had pulled us apart, but he was never not my father.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我感到身体内的感情汹涌。我需要使劲控制住自己不哭出来。我这十年里的生活缺憾，好像在一瞬间被填满了，好像父亲只离开了我一天。多年以来，我内心有那么多的疑问。他会想我吗？他知道我在做什么吗？他为我骄傲吗？但事实是，他一直陪着我。他一直在为我骄傲。因为环境让我们分开了，但他没有一天不是我的父亲。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I walked out of his house that day an inch taller. Seeing him had reaffirmed his choosing of me. He chose to have me in his life. He chose to answer my letter. I was wanted. Being chosen is the greatest gift you can give to another human being.</div>

<div class="line_en">I went down to spend a few days with my father, and I made it my mission: This weekend I will get to know my father. As soon as I arrived I started peppering him with questions. "Where are you from? Where did you go to school? Why did you do this? How did you do that?" He started getting visibly irritated.</div>

<div class="line_en">Once we reconnected, I was overcome by this drive to make up for all the years we'd missed. I decided the best way to do it was to interview him. I realized very quickly that that was a mistake. Interviews will give you facts and information, but facts and information weren't really what I was after. What I wanted was a relationship, and an interview is not a relationship. Relationships are built in the silences. You spend time with people, you observe them and interact with them, and you come to know them -- and that is what apartheid stole from us: time. You can't make up for that with an interview, but I had to figure that out for myself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们重新联系上后，我有一种强烈的愿望，想要弥补我们错失的这些年。我想出的最好的方式就是采访他。很快我就发现这是个错误。采访可以给你事实和信息，但是我真正想要的并不是事实和信息。我想要的是一段关系，而采访不是关系。关系是建立在沉默上的。你和别人共度一段时间，你望着他们，和他们接触，然后开始了解他们——然而种族隔离让我们缺失了这个部分，也就是时间。你无法用采访来弥补上这段缺损的时间，但我得靠自己想明白这件事。">查看中文翻译</div>
