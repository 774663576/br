<div class="line_en">"Maybe you two would feel better if I explained what I'm trying to do down in the basement," Dr. Brewer said, shifting his weight and leaning back on his hands. "I've been so wrapped up in my experiments, I haven't had much time to talk to you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“如果我跟你们解释清楚我在地下室做的事情，或许你们俩会感觉好受些，”布鲁尔博士说着，挪了挪身子，向后枕在自己的双手上。“我一头扑在试验中，没有太多时间跟你们聊天。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Have you ever talked about DNA in school?" their father asked. They shook their heads. "Well, it's pretty complicated," he continued. Dr. Brewer thought for a moment. "Let me try and put it in simple terms," he said, fiddling with the bandage around his hand. "Let's say we took a person who had a very high IQ. You know. Real brain power."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你们在学校曾经学过DNA吗？”爸爸问。他们摇摇头。“呃，它相当复杂，”他继续说。布鲁尔博士想了一会儿后，拨动着手上的绷带说：“那我尽量说得简单一些，我们拿一个高智商的人来说。真正有脑子那种。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No, I'm trying to build a new kind of plant," Dr. Brewer explained.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“凯西，闭嘴，”玛格丽特烦躁地说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"A real brain. Like Casey," Dr. Brewer said agreeably. "And let's say we were able to isolate the molecule or gene or tiny part of a gene that enabled the person to have such high intelligence. And then let's say we were able to transmit it into other brains. And then this brain power could be passed along from generation to generation. And lots of people would have a high IQ. Do you understand?" He looked first at Casey, then at Margaret.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“一个高智商的人，就像凯西一样，”布鲁尔博士随和地说。“假设我们能够分离出使人们拥有高智商的分子、或基因、或是基因的微小部分，假设我们能把它移植到别的大脑里面，这些智能可以一代接一代地传下去，这样许多人就会拥有高智商了。你们明白了吗？”他先看了看凯西，又看了看玛格丽特。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Not exactly," their father said, lowering his voice. "I'm doing something a little more unusual. I really don't want to go into detail now. But I'll tell you that what I'm trying to do is build a kind of plant that has never existed and could never exist. I'm trying to build a plant that's part animal."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不完全是，”爸爸压低了声音说道，“我做的事情有点不寻常，我现在确实不想细说。但我可以告诉你们，我要创造一种没有存在过，也不可能存在的植物，我要创造的是种半植物半动物的物种。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yeah. Kind of," Margaret said. "You take a good quality from one person and put it into other people. And then they have the good quality, too, and they pass it on to their children, and on and on."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，懂了点，”玛格丽特说道，“你从一个人身上取出好的素质，放到别人的身上。然后他们也有了良好的素质，他们会把它传给下一代，一直传下去。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Very good," Dr. Brewer said, smiling for the first time in weeks. "That's what a lot of botanists do with plants. They try to take the fruit-bearing building block from one plant and put it into another. Create a new plant that will bear five times as much fruit, or five times as much grain, or vegetables."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“非常好，”布鲁尔博士说着，笑了。这是几个星期以来的第一次笑。“许多植物学家也拿植物这么做。他们试着从一株植物中取出结果实的基因组，嫁接到另一株上，创造出一种新的植物，产出5倍多的水果、谷物或蔬菜。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"And that's what you're doing?" Casey asked.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你怎么做的呢？”玛格丽特一边问，一边费劲地想着爸爸刚才告诉他们的一切。“你怎样从动物身上取出细胞再移植到植物上面呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm trying to do it by breaking them down electronically," he answered. "I have two glass booths connected by a powerful electron generator. You may have seen them when you were snooping around down there." He made a sour face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我试着用电解，”爸爸答道，“我有两个玻璃亭子，它们由一个功能强大的发电机连在一起。你们在地下室偷看时，可能已经看到了。”他说到这儿，脸上有点不太高兴。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yeah. They look like phone booths," Casey said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是啊，它们看起来就像电话亭，”凯西说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I've come very close," Dr. Brewer said, a pleased smile crossing his face. The smile lasted only a few seconds. Then, his expression thoughtful, he abruptly climbed to his feet. "Got to get back to work," he said quietly. "See you two later." He started walking across the lawn, taking long strides.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“非常接近了，”布鲁尔博士说着，露出得意的微笑。但笑容只停留了几秒钟。之后，脸上出现的是思考的神情。他突然一下子站起身来，“要回去工作了，”他小声说，“一会儿见。”他迈开大步，穿过草坪。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He nodded. "I really don't want to say more. You two understand why this must be kept secret." He turned his eyes on Margaret, then Casey, studying their reactions.</div>

<div class="line_en">Dr. Brewer shrugged. "Nothing to explain," he said curtly. "Just a side effect." He adjusted his Dodgers cap. "Don't worry about it. It's only temporary. Just a side effect." Then he hurried into the house.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布鲁尔博士耸耸肩。“没什么可解释的，”他简略地说，“只是副作用。”爸爸调整了一下道奇棒球帽。“别担心，它只是暂时的，不过是副作用而已。”说完，他匆忙进屋了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But, Dad," Margaret called after him. She and Casey climbed to their feet, too. "Your head. The leaves. You didn't explain it," she said as she and her brother hurried to catch up to him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“但是，爸爸，”玛格丽特在他后面叫道。她和凯西也站了起来。“你的头，还有叶子，你还没有解释，”她和弟弟快速追上爸爸说道。">查看中文翻译</div>
