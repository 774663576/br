<div class="line_en">The first trains from Paris, distracted, starving, despairing Paris, were making their way to the new frontiers, slowly passing through the country districts and the villages. The passengers gazed through the windows at the ravaged fields and burned hamlets. Prussian soldiers, in their black helmets with brass spikes, were smoking their pipes astride their chairs in front of the houses which were still left standing. Others were working or talking just as if they were members of the families. As you passed through the different towns you saw entire regiments drilling in the squares, and, in spite of the rumble of the carriage-wheels, you could every moment hear the hoarse words of command.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从那座精神错乱，饥饿不堪而百般失望的巴黎市里，头几列火车出发了，开向新定的国界去，慢吞吞地穿过好些村落和田园。初次旅行的人都从列车窗口里注视着那些完全成了颓垣败瓦的平原和那些烧光了的小村子。好些普鲁士兵戴着黄铜尖顶的黑铁盔，骑在那些仅存的房子门外的椅子上吸他们的烟斗。另外好些个正在那儿做工或者谈话，俨然像是门内那户人家中间的一员似的。每逢列车在各处城市经过的时候，大家就看见整团整团的德国兵正在广场上操演，尽管有列车轮子的喧闹，但是他们那些发嘎的口令声音竟一阵阵传到了列车里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Famine and hardship had not diminished his big paunch so characteristic of the rich, peace-loving merchant. He had gone through the terrible events of the past year with sorrowful resignation and bitter complaints at the savagery of men. Now that he was journeying to the frontier at the close of the war, he saw the Prussians for the first time, although he had done his duty on the ramparts and mounted guard on many a cold night.</div>

<div class="line_en">Suddenly the train stopped at a little village station, and a Prussian officer jumped up with a great clatter of his sabre on the double footboard of the railway carriage. He was tall, wore a tight-fitting uniform, and had whiskers up to his eyes. His red hair seemed to be on fire, and his long mustache, of a paler hue, stuck out on both sides of his face, which it seemed to cut in two.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="忽然，列车在一个小城市的车站上停住了，一个普鲁士军官，在佩刀和客车的两级踏脚板相触的巨大响声里，从车厢的门口上了车。他的高大的身材紧紧裹在军服里，胡子几乎连到了眼角。下颏的长髯红得像是着了火；上唇的长髭须的颜色略微淡些，分别斜着向脸儿的两边翘起，脸儿好像是分成了两截。">查看中文翻译</div>

Then the Prussian officer began to laugh. And still, lolling back, he began to sneer. He sneered at the downfall of France, insulted the prostrate enemy; he sneered at Austria, which had been recently conquered; he sneered at the valiant but fruitless defence of the departments; he sneered at the Garde Mobile and at the useless artillery. He announced that Bismarck was going to build a city of iron with the captured cannon. And suddenly he placed his boots against the thigh of M.

The Prussian struggled, tried to draw his sword, to clinch with his adversary, who was on top of him. But M. Dubuis crushed him with his enormous weight and kept punching him without taking breath or knowing where his blows fell.
