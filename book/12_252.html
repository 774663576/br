<div class="line_en">Sam, waking suddenly by some instinct of watchfulness, saw first his master's empty bed and leapt to his feet. Then he saw two dark figures, Frodo and a man, framed against the archway, which was now filled with a pale white light. He hurried after them, past rows of men sleeping on mattresses along the wall. As he went by the cave-mouth he saw that the Curtain was now become a dazzling veil of silk and pearls and silver thread: melting icicles of moonlight. But he did not pause to admire it, and turning aside he followed his master through the narrow doorway in the wall of the cave.</div>

<div class="line_en">Frodo turned to watch the sleek necks of the water as they curved and dived. Then he lifted his eyes and gazed far away. The world was quiet and cold, as if dawn were near. Far off in the West the full moon was sinking, round and white. Pale mists shimmered in the great vale below: a wide gulf of silver fume, beneath which rolled the cool night-waters of the Anduin. A black darkness loomed beyond, and in it glinted, here and there, cold, sharp, remote, white as the teeth of ghosts, the peaks of Ered Nimrais, the White Mountains of the realm of Gondor, tipped with everlasting snow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="佛罗多转过身，看着那左弯右拐的水流，然后他抬起头，望向远方。天空安静而冰冷，黎明似乎即将来临。在更远的地方，一轮圆月正慢慢地落下。苍白的雾气围绕着底下壮丽的山谷，这是一个填满了银色雾气的海湾，底下奔流着夜晚的安都因大河，在之外则是一片墨黑，许多白色、冰冷、遥远得如同鬼牙一般的白点点缀在其间；这是伊瑞德尼姆拉斯，刚铎的白色山脉，上面挂着不融化的积雪。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At last they came out of the stony darkness and looked about. They were on a wide flat rock without rail or parapet. At their right, eastwards, the torrent fell, splashing over many terraces, and then, pouring down a steep race, it filled a smooth-hewn channel with a dark force of water flecked with foam, and curling and rushing almost at their feet it plunged sheer over the edge that yawned upon their left. A man stood there, near the brink, silent, gazing down.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后，他们脱离了岩石中的黑暗，可以自由地往四下看去。他们正站在一个没有任何依靠的平坦岩石上，在他们的右手边，也就是东方，激流落在许多的阶梯上，然后，它落入一道开凿出来的光滑渠道，化成冒着白沫不停下落的水流，发出喋喋不休的喧扰之声，正从他们的脚底下通过，落入左边的黑暗开口。一名男子站在悬崖边，一言不发地往下看。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They went first along a black passage, then up many wet steps, and so came to a small flat landing cut in the stone and lit by the pale sky, gleaming high above through a long deep shaft. From here two flights of steps led: one going on, as it seemed, up on to the high bank of the stream; the other turning away to the left. This they followed. It wound its way up like a turret-stair.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们一头栽进一个黑暗的信道中，然后又往上走了很多阶潮湿的楼梯，最后来到一个在岩石中挖出的小小平台，此地在头顶上一个天井，透过的月光下显得闪闪发亮。从这里开始，阶梯分成两个，一个继续往上走，似乎通到瀑布的边缘，另一个则是转向左边。他们沿着后者继续前进，它弯弯曲曲的往上攀升，像是塔楼中的阶梯一般。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sam was eager for an answer to the same question and could not refrain himself from muttering, for his master's ear alone as he thought: "It's a fine view, no doubt, Mr. Frodo, but chilly to the heart, not to mention the bones! What's going on?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山姆也急着想要知道，因此又等不及开始喃喃自语，当然，他以为这只有主人听得见：“佛罗多先生，这的确是个很美的景色，但是让人有种心寒的感觉，更别提那种冷入骨髓的冷风了！到底有什么事情？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For a while Frodo stood there on the high stone, and a shiver ran through him, wondering if anywhere in the vastness of the nightlands his old companions walked or slept, or lay dead shrouded in mist. Why was he brought here out of forgetful sleep?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="佛罗多站在那高耸的岩石上沉默了片刻，一阵寒意流过他的背脊：不知道在这片黑暗的大地上，队友们究竟在何处躺卧，又或是安息在河方？为什么把他叫醒，带到这边来呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He stepped up beside the silent sentinel on the dark edge, and Frodo followed. Sam hung back. He already felt insecure enough on this high wet platform. Faramir and Frodo looked down. Far below them they saw the white waters pour into a foaming bowl, and then swirl darkly about a deep oval basin in the rocks, until they found their way out again through a narrow gate, and flowed away, fuming and chattering, into calmer and more level reaches. The moonlight still slanted down to the fall's foot and gleamed on the ripples of the basin. Presently Frodo was aware of a small dark thing on the near bank, but even as he looked at it, it dived and vanished just beyond the boil and bubble of the fall, cleaving the black water as neatly as an arrow or an edgewise stone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他走到黑暗边缘的哨兵身边，佛罗多跟着照做，山姆则是站在原地，光是这块高耸、潮湿的平台就让他觉得够不安了。法拉墨和佛罗多一起往下看，他们可以看见底下的白色水沫喷进一个巨大冒泡的池塘中，然后，沿着岩石间的椭圆形池子卷动着，直到它们再度找到一个狭窄的出口，哼着歌声流入更平坦的地形。月光依旧照在瀑布的底端，在池中的波澜上反射着光芒。此刻，佛罗多发现有个小小的黑色身影站在池边，不过，就在他眼前，那身影潜入水中，落入瀑布激起的大量泡沫中，像是一枚飞箭一般干净俐落地将水面切割开来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Faramir heard and answered. "Moonset over Gondor. Fair Ithil, as he goes from Middle-earth, glances upon the white locks of old Mindolluin. It is worth a few shivers. But that is not what I brought you to see -- though as for you, Samwise, you were not brought, and do but pay the penalty of your watchfulness. A draught of wine shall amend it. Come, look now!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="法拉墨听见了，立刻回答道：“月落刚铎，这是伊西尔在他去世以前，眼中所见的美丽景象，那是古老的明多陆安山，这景色值得你稍稍发一下抖，不过，这并非是我带你们来此的主因。至于你，山姆魏斯，我并没有带你来，你只是为了自己的小心翼翼付出代价而已，相信喝杯酒就可以压过你的紧张，过来，和我们一起看吧！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"This not a bird, whatever else it be," answered Anborn. "It has four limbs and dives manwise; a pretty mastery of the craft it shows, too. What is it at? Seeking a way up behind the Curtain to our hidings? It seems we are discovered at last. I have my bow here, and I have posted other archers, nigh as good marksmen as myself, on either bank. We wait only for your command to shoot, Captain."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不管它是什么，总之绝对不是翠鸟，”安朋回答道：“他拥有四肢，潜水的样子很像人类，看起水性非常好。他到底在找什么？想要找路穿过水幕进入我们的藏身处？看来我们似乎被发现了。我身上带着弓箭，我也在池塘的两边安排了和我一样百步穿杨的射手。将军，只要你一声令下，我们马上会把他射死。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“可以吗？”法拉墨很快地转向佛罗多。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Faramir turned to the man at his side. "Now what would you say that it is, Anborn? A squirrel, or a kingfisher? Are there black kingfishers in the night-pools of Mirkwood?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"You know, then, what this thing is?" said Faramir. "Come, now you have seen, tell me why it should be spared. In all our words together you have not once spoken of your gangrel companion, and I let him be for the time. He could wait till he was caught and brought before me. I sent my keenest huntsmen to seek him, but he slipped them, and they had no sight of him till now, save Anborn here, once at dusk yesterevening. But now he has done worse trespass than only to go coney-snaring in the uplands: he has dared to come to Henneth Annûn, and his life is forfeit. I marvel at the creature: so secret and so sly as he is, to come sporting in the pool before our very window. Does he think that men sleep without watch all night? Why does he so?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那么，你知道这是什么罗？”法拉墨说：“来吧，既然你已经看过了，告诉我为什么要饶过他。在我们之前的所有谈话中，你完全没有提及这个猥琐的同伴，我也暂时不加追问，这可以等到我们将他抓到，带到面前来再说。我派出了最精锐的猎手去找寻他，但是他都躲了过去，除了在此地的安朋之外，完全没有其它人发现他的踪迹，而他还是在昨晚才注意到的。不过，现在，他所做的比在这块土地上捕捉兔子还更危险许多，他竟然胆敢来到汉那斯安南，这下他只有死路一条了。我对于这个生物感到非常好奇，他行踪这么隐密、如此狡猾，竟然敢在我们藏身地之前的池塘中游泳，难道他以为人类晚上睡觉的时候都不会警戒吗？他为什么会这样做？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"There are two answers, I think," said Frodo. "For one thing, he knows little of Men, and sly though he is, your refuge is so hidden that perhaps he does not know that Men are concealed here. For another, I think he is allured here by a mastering desire, stronger than his caution."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我想，有两个答案，”佛罗多说：“首先，他对于人类所知甚少，即使他这么狡猾，但你的藏身处是如此隐密，他可能根本不知道有人类躲在里面。其次，我想他是受到一种强大的诱惑所吸引，超越了他的自制力。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He is lured here, you say?" said Faramir in a low voice. "Can he, does he then know of your burden?"</div>

<div class="line_en">They peered down at the dark pool. A little black head appeared at the far end of the basin, just out of the deep shadow of the rocks. There was a brief silver glint, and a swirl of tiny ripples. It swam to the side, and then with marvellous agility a froglike figure climbed out of the water and up the bank. At once it sat down and began to gnaw at the small silver thing that glittered as it turned: the last rays of the moon were now falling behind the stony wall at the pool's end.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们低头看向那黑暗的池子，一颗黑色的小脑袋出现在池子的另外一边，正好在岩石另外一边的阴影中；池中传来一阵银色的闪光，以及一阵涟漪。他游到另外一边，似乎拥有如同青蛙一样的敏捷度，同时爬出水面。他立刻坐了下来，在池边啃着刚刚发出银色闪光的物体，最后的一丝月光现在已经落入池子的另外一边。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"The creature is wretched and hungry," said Frodo, "and unaware of his danger. And Gandalf, your Mithrandir, he would have bidden you not to slay him for that reason, and for others. He forbade the Elves to do so. I do not know clearly why, and of what I guess I cannot speak openly out here. But this creature is in some way bound up with my errand. Until you found us and took us, he was my guide."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="佛罗多说：“这个生物相当可怜，他也只不过是肚子饿而已，而且也不清楚自己所身处的危险；还有甘道夫，你口中的米斯兰达，他也会要求你不要因为这些原因而射杀他，他也不准精灵这样做。我不太确定到底为什么，就算我猜得出来，我也不能在这边公开说。但这个生物以某个角度来看，似乎和我的任务息息相关，在你找到我们，并且将我们带走之前，他是我的向导。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Faramir laughed softly. "Fish!" he said. "It is a less perilous hunger. Or maybe not: fish from the pool of Henneth Annûn may cost him all he has to give."</div>

I would do much for you, Frodo, but this I cannot grant: to let this sly wanderer go free at his own will from here, to join you later if it please him, or to be caught by orcs and tell all he knows under threat of pain. He must be slain or taken. Slain, if he be not taken very swiftly. But how can this slippery thing of many guises be caught, save by a feathered shaft?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Anborn grunted and led the way down the winding stair to the landing, and then up the other stair, until at last they came to a narrow opening shrouded with thick bushes. Passing silently through, Frodo found himself on the top of the southern bank above the pool. It was now dark and the falls were pale and grey, reflecting only the lingering moonlight of the western sky. He could not see Gollum. He went forward a short way and Anborn came softly behind him.</div>

<div class="line_en">So it went on, almost as unceasing as the waterfall, only interrupted by a faint noise of slavering and gurgling. Frodo shivered, listening with pity and disgust. He wished it would stop, and that he never need hear that voice again. Anborn was not far behind. He could creep back and ask him to get the huntsmen to shoot. They would probably get close enough, while Gollum was gorging and off his guard. Only one true shot, and Frodo would be rid of the miserable voice for ever. But no, Gollum had a claim on him now. The servant has a claim on the master for service, even service in fear. They would have foundered in the Dead Marshes but for Gollum. Frodo knew, too, somehow, quite clearly that Gandalf would not have wished it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他就这样一直不断的重复着，几乎和瀑布一样无止无休，中间只被他进食所发出的噪音所打断。佛罗多打了个寒颤，带着怜悯和厌恶的情绪听着他喃喃自语。他真希望这一切可以停止下来，他永远不需要再听见那声音。安朋就在不远的地方，他可以溜回去，要求他让射手发射；在咕鲁大快朵颐的时候，这些人或许可以靠得够近，可以一举射杀他，只要一支正中目标的箭，就可以让佛罗多永远摆脱这可恶的声音。可是，不行，他必须负起照顾咕鲁的责任，主人必须因为仆人的服务而照顾他们，即使这服务是出自于恐惧。如果不是咕鲁，他们可能早就在死亡沼泽中迷途，佛罗多知道，甘道夫也不会希望这样的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Frodo crept forward, using his hands Gollum-like to feel his way and to steady himself. The rocks were for the most part flat and smooth but slippery. He halted listening.

<div class="line_en">There was a sharp hiss. Presently out of the darkness Gollum came crawling on all fours, like an erring dog called to heel. He had a half-eaten fish in his mouth and another in his hand. He came close to Frodo, almost nose to nose, and sniffed at him. His pale eyes were shining. Then he took the fish out of his mouth and stood up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="黑暗中传来猛然吸气的声音，咕鲁四肢并用地从阴影中爬了出来，像是只被召唤的听话狗狗一样。他嘴巴里叼着一只吃到一半的鱼，手上则拿着另外一只。他走到佛罗多身前，几乎和他面对面，开始嗅闻他的味道。他苍白的眼睛开始闪亮，然后从嘴里拿出鱼，站了起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Away up there," said Frodo, pointing to the waterfall. "I am not going without him. We must go back to him." His heart sank. This was too much like trickery. He did not really fear that Faramir would allow Gollum to be killed, but he would probably make him prisoner and bind him; and certainly what Frodo did would seem a treachery to the poor treacherous creature. It would probably be impossible ever to make him understand or believe that Frodo had saved his life in the only way he could. What else could he do? -- to keep faith, as near as might be, with both sides. "Come!" he said. "Or the Precious will be angry. We are going back now, up the stream. Go on, go on, you go in front!"</div>

He spat and stretched out his long arms with white snapping fingers.</div>

<div class="line_en">Frodo followed them, feeling very wretched. They went through the opening behind the bushes, and back, down the stairs and passages, into the cave. Two or three torches had been lit. Men were stirring. Sam was there, and he gave a queer look at the limp bundle that the men carried. "Got him?" he said to Frodo.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="佛罗多紧跟在后，觉得胸中有着极大的罪恶感。他们穿越了树丛中的开口，沿着楼梯和信道再度回到洞穴中。洞穴中又点亮了两支或是三支的火把，人们开始骚动。山姆也在那边，他对那些人所扛着的东西投以怪异的眼光。“抓到他了吗？”他问佛罗多道。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A man came and beckoned to the hobbits, and took them to the recess at the back of the cave. Faramir was sitting there in his chair, and the lamp had been rekindled in its niche above his head. He signed to them to sit down on the stools beside him. "Bring wine for the guests," he said. "And bring the prisoner to me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一名男子走了过来，对哈比人比了个手势，示意他们走到洞穴后方的隔间去。法拉墨坐在那里的椅子上，头上壁龛中的油灯也再度点亮了。他示意两人在旁边的凳子上坐下来。“替我们的客人送酒来，”他说：“也把那俘虏带到我面前。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes. Well no, I didn't get him. He came to me, because he trusted me at first, I'm afraid. I did not want him tied up like this. I hope it will be all right; but I hate the whole business."</div>

Gollum blinked, hooding the malice of his eyes with their heavy pale lids. A very miserable creature he looked, dripping and dank, smelling of fish (he still clutched one in his hand); his sparse locks were hanging like rank weed over his bony brows, his nose was snivelling. "Loose us! Loose us!" he said. "The cord hurts us, yes it does, it hurts us, and we've done nothing."</div>

<div class="line_en">"No other way?" said Faramir. "How do you know that? And who has explored all the confines of that dark realm?" He looked long and thoughtfully at Gollum. Presently he spoke again. "Take this creature away, Anborn. Treat him gently, but watch him. And do not you, Sméagol, try to dive into the falls. The rocks have such teeth there as would slay you before your time. Leave us now and take your fish!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没有别的路了？”法拉墨说：“你怎么会知道？谁曾经彻底的探索过那黑暗的国度？”他若有所思地打亮了咕鲁很长的一段时间。不久之后，他又开口了：“安朋，带走这家伙，对他好一点，但不要松懈。史麦戈，你也不要跳进瀑布里面，底下的岩石会把你撕成碎片的。赶快离开，去吃你的鱼去！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Anborn went out and Gollum went cringing before him. The curtain was drawn across the recess.</div>

<div class="line_en">"He would not take it," said Frodo. "He would follow after me as he long has done. And I have promised many times to take him under my protection and to go where he led. You would not ask me to break faith with him?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"Not wholly, perhaps," said Faramir; "but malice eats it like a canker, and the evil is growing. He will lead you to no good. If you will part with him, I will give him safe-conduct and guidance to any point on the borders of Gondor that he may name."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“或许不全是坏心眼，”法拉墨说：“但是，恐惧会吞蚀他的心灵，他体内的邪恶也在不停地滋长，他不会把你们带到什么好地方去的。如果你愿意让他离开，我可以安全地把他带到刚铎边境任何一个他指定的地方去。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No," said Faramir. "But my heart would. For it seems less evil to counsel another man to break troth than to do so oneself, especially if one sees a friend bound unwitting to his own harm. But no -- if he will go with you, you must now endure him. But I do not think you are holden to go to Cirith Ungol, of which he has told you less than he knows. That much I perceived clearly in his mind. Do not go to Cirith Ungol!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，”法拉墨说：“但我其实私底下很想请你这样做，因为，当一个人看到朋友将自己和厄运绑在一起的时候，劝告他背信似乎不能算是种恶行。可是，我还是做不到──如果他愿意和你继续走下去，你只能接受他。只是，我并不认为你的目的地是他所说的西力斯昂哥，就算如此，他对于该处也有许多事情没有告诉你们。我可以清楚地从他心中感觉到，千万别去西力斯昂哥！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Nothing certain," said Faramir. "We of Gondor do not ever pass east of the Road in these days, and none of us younger men has ever done so, nor has any of us set foot upon the Mountains of Shadow. Of them we know only old report and the rumour of bygone days. But there is some dark terror that dwells in the passes above Minas Morgul. If Cirith Ungol is named, old men and masters of lore will blanch and fall silent."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没有什么确定的情报，”法拉墨说：“我们刚铎人已经不再进入东方的道路上，年轻人甚至一辈子也没有来过这里，我们也都没有进入过黯影山脉，我们对它的一切所知都是来自古代的情报和旧日的谣言。但是，我们确信，在米那斯魔窟之上的道路中，居住着某种邪恶的力量，只要一提到西力斯昂哥的名字，老一辈的人和饱读历史的学者都会大惊失色，不愿多说。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The valley of Minas Morgul passed into evil very long ago, and it was a menace and a dread while the banished Enemy dwelt yet far away, and Ithilien was still for the most part in our keeping. As you know, that city was once a strong place, proud and fair, Minas Ithil, the twin sister of our own city. But it was taken by fell men whom the Enemy in his first strength had dominated, and who wandered homeless and masterless after his fall. It is said that their lords were men of Númenor who had fallen into dark wickedness; to them the Enemy had given rings of power, and he had devoured them: living ghosts they were become, terrible and evil. After his going they took Minas Ithil and dwelt there, and they filled it, and all the valley about, with decay: it seemed empty and was not so, for a shapeless fear lived within the ruined walls. Nine Lords there were, and after the return of their Master, which they aided and prepared in secret, they grew strong again. Then the Nine Riders issued forth from the gates of horror, and we could not withstand them. Do not approach their citadel. You will be espied. It is a place of sleepless malice, full of lidless eyes. Do not go that way!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“米那斯魔窟的山谷在很久以前就落入了邪恶的魔掌，即使在魔王被驱赶到远方的时候，那里就是个充满恐怖与威胁的土地，当时伊西立安的大部分还在我们的掌握之中。正如同你所知道的一样，这座城市曾经一度是个骄傲、美丽的要塞，也是我们城市的姊妹城。但是，它在魔王第一次掌权的时候就被堕落的人类给攻占了，在魔王被推翻之后，这些人漫无目的四处流浪。据说他们的领袖是堕落入黑暗之道的努曼诺尔人，魔王赐给他们拥有权能的戒指，它将他们慢慢地吞蚀：让他们成为活生生的鬼魂，拥有恐怖邪恶的力量。在魔王离去之后，他们占领了米那斯伊西尔，并且居住在此处，他们将该城和整座山谷中都填满了腐败之气。表面上看起来似乎空无一物，但实际上这废墟中却居住着无形体的恐惧，九名君王隐身在该处，经过他们的秘密筹备之后，魔王又再度回归，他们也变得更为强大。然后，九名骑士从恐惧之门中窜出，我们毫无抵抗他们的方法。千万别靠近他们的要塞，你将会被他们发现，那是个充满了永不松懈的恐惧之处，他们永远不会放松戒备。千万别往那个方向走！”">查看中文翻译</div>

But over the mountains I am bound, by solemn undertaking to the Council, to find a way or perish in the seeking. And if I turn back, refusing the road in its bitter end, where then shall I go among Elves or Men? Would you have me come to Gondor with this Thing, the Thing that drove your brother mad with desire?

<div class="line_en">"Well, so we meet and part, Frodo son of Drogo. You have no need of soft words: I do not hope to see you again on any other day under this Sun. But you shall go now with my blessing upon you, and upon all your people. Rest a little while food is prepared for you. I would gladly learn how this creeping Sméagol became possessed of the Thing of which we speak, and how he lost it, but I will not trouble you now. If ever beyond hope you return to the lands of the living and we re-tell our tales, sitting by a wall in the sun, laughing at old grief, you shall tell me then. Until that time, or some other time beyond the vision of the Seeing-stones of Númenor, farewell!"</div>
