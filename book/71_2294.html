<div class="line_en">However, Valentine had not been warned of his arrival, since this was not the usual time when he came, and pure chance -- or, if you prefer, a sympathetic instinct -- had brought her to the garden. When she appeared, Morrel called her and she ran to the gate. "You! At this time!" she said.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was, indeed, Morrel who had been in a frantic state since the previous evening. With that instinct which only lovers and mothers possess, he had guessed that, following Mme de Saint-Méran's return and the death of the marquis, something would happen that affected his love for Valentine. As we shall see, his forebodings had been realized and it was not mere anxiety that brought him in fear and trembling to the gate by the chestnut-trees.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那的确是玛西米兰·摩莱尔。自从前一天起，他就过着一种非常痛苦的生活。凭着情人们所特具的本能，他预料到在侯爵去世和圣·米兰夫人回来以后，维尔福先生的家里将会发生某种与他这个凡兰蒂的情人有很大利害关系的事情。我们马上就会看到，他的预感的确变成了事实。使他脸色苍白、浑身战栗地来到栗子树下铁门前的，并不仅仅是一种不安的感觉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes, my poor friend," Morrel replied, "I have come to look for you, bringing bad news."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Maximilien," said Valentine, "I don't want to hide anything from you. They were discussing my marriage this morning, and my grandmother, on whom I had counted as an unfailing support, not only declared herself to be in favour of my marrying Franz d'Epinay, but wants it so much that she is only waiting for his return: the contract will be signed the very next day."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我把一切都告诉你，”凡兰蒂说，“对你，我什么都不必隐讳。这件事情今天早晨谈到了，而我那亲爱的外祖母，我本来算定她可以帮助我的，非但赞成这门亲事，而且极其切望赶快办成，他们只等伊辟楠先生一到，第二天就签订婚约。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The young man gave a painful sigh and for a long time stared sadly at the girl. "Alas," he said quietly, "it is terrible to hear the woman one loves say calmly: 'The hour of your torment is fixed, it will take place shortly, but no matter, this must be and I shall not make any objection to it.' Well, since you tell me that they are only waiting for Monsieur d'Epinay to sign the contract, and since you will be his the day after he arrives home, then you will be engaged to Monsieur d'Epinay tomorrow, because he reached Paris this morning."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那个青年人不禁长叹了一声，悲哀地凝视着他的爱人。“唉！”他用低沉的声音说，“听自己所爱的女人泰然地说出这样的话来，真太可怕了，这就等于说：‘你行刑的时间已经定了，几小时之内就要执行。但这是无关紧要的事情，这必须得如此，我不愿意插身其间来阻止它。’嗯，既然如你所说的，一切只等伊辟楠先生一到就可以了结，在他到后的第二天，婚书就要签订，你就将属于他——那末你明天就要和伊辟楠先生订婚。因为今天早晨他已经到巴黎了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I was with the Count of Monte Cristo an hour ago," Morrel continued. "We were talking, he about the sorrow in your house and I about your sorrow, when suddenly a carriage pulled up in the courtyard. Listen, I have never until now believed in premonitions, Valentine, but henceforth I must. At the sound of that carriage, I began to tremble. Soon I heard footsteps on the stairs. The echoing steps of the Commander did not terrify Don Juan more than those steps terrified me. At length the door opened. Albert de Morcerf was the first to come in and I was about to doubt my own instincts and decide that I had been mistaken, when another young man approached behind him and the count exclaimed: 'Ah, Baron Franz d'Epinay!' I had to summon up all the strength and courage in my heart to contain my feelings. I may have gone pale, I may have shuddered, but I certainly kept a smile on my lips. Five minutes later, however, I left without hearing a single word of what had been said in that time. I was totally prostrate."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“一小时以前，我在基督山家里，”摩莱尔说，“我们正在谈天，他谈论你家里所遭到的不幸，我谈论你的伤心，那时忽然有一辆马车辚辚地滚进前庭来。在那时以前，我从来不相信有‘预感’之类的东西，但现在我却不能不相信了，凡兰蒂。听到那辆马车的声音，我就打了一个寒颤，不久我就听到楼梯上响起脚步声，把我吓得象死囚听到监斩官的脚步声一样。门终于开了，第一个进来的是阿尔培·马瑟夫，我开始打消我的恐惧，但当他的后面又进来一个青年人，而伯爵喊出：‘啊！弗兰士·伊辟楠男爵阁下！’的时候，我就集中我的全部力量和勇气来支持自己。或许我的脸色曾发白，或许我曾发抖，但我确信我的嘴唇上始终保持着微笑。五分钟以后我就告辞，在那五分钟里面，他们所说的话我一个字都没有听到——我算是彻底毁灭了！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Listen," said Morrel, "this is not the first time that you have thought about the situation in which we now find ourselves. It is serious, it is pressing, it is crucial. I do not think this is the moment to give way to sterile misery: that may be enough for those who want to suffer at their ease and have time to drink their own tears. There are people like that, and God will no doubt reward them in heaven for their resignation on earth; but anyone who has the will to fight will not lose precious time, but immediately strike back at that Fate which has dealt a blow. Have you the will to fight against ill-fortune, Valentine? Tell me, because that is what I have come to ask you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“听着！”摩莱尔说，“我们目前的情形非常严重急迫，这种情形你当然不是第一次考虑到。我觉得现在不是作无谓的悲哀的时候，这种事情让那些喜欢慢慢地受痛苦和安闲地吞服眼泪的人去做吧。世界上的确有这种人，而因为他们肯在人世间听天由命，上帝无疑的会在天上报偿他们。但在那些准备抵抗的人，他们就决不能损失一刻宝贵的时间而必须对命运之神的打击立刻予以还击。你是否预备和我们的恶运奋斗？告诉我，凡兰蒂，因为我就是为了问这件事情而来的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Valentine shuddered and looked at Morrel wide-eyed in terror. The idea of standing up to her father, her grandfather, in short her whole family, had not even occurred to her. "What are you saying, Maximilien?" she asked. "What do you mean by 'fight'? Rather call it a sacrilege! Am I to struggle against my father's orders and the wishes of my dying grandmother! Impossible!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凡兰蒂浑身颤抖，恐怖地凝视着摩莱尔。去违抗她的父亲、她的外祖母以及她的整个家庭，这种念头她从来没有想到过。“你说什么，玛西米兰？”凡兰蒂问道。“你所谓奋斗是什么意思？噢，这是亵渎神圣的呀！什么！我违抗我父亲的命令和我那垂死的外祖母的心意？不可能的！”">查看中文翻译</div>

That has been my life. Now, I no longer think anything. All I can tell myself is that fate has turned against me, that I expected to win heaven and I have lost it. It happens every day that a gambler loses not only what he has, but also what he does not have."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Listen to me, my dear, my beloved Valentine," he said in his low, melodious voice. "People like us, who have never had a thought that would have made them blush before others, before their parents or before God, people like us can read one another's hearts like an open book. I have never been a character in a novel, I am not a melancholy hero, I have no pretensions to be Manfred or Antony. But without words, without oaths and protestations, I entrusted my life to you. You are failing me and you are right to do what you are doing, I told you so and I repeat it. But you are failing me and my life is lost. If you go away from me, Valentine, I shall be alone in the world. My sister is happy with her husband, and her husband is only my brother-in-law, that is to say a man who is attached to me by social convention alone; hence, no one on earth has any need of me and my existence is useless. This is what I shall do: I shall wait until the last second before you are married, because I do not wish to lose even the faintest shadow of one of those unexpected twists of fate that chance sometimes has in store for us: between now and then, Franz d'Epinay may die; or, just as you are approaching it, a bolt of lightning may strike the altar. To a condemned man, everything is credible and, when his life itself is at stake, miracles may be counted possible events. So, as I say, I shall wait until the final moment and when my misfortune is certain, without any hope or remedy, I shall write a confidential letter to my brother-in-law and another to the prefect of police to inform him of my intention, and in the corner of some wood, beside some ditch or on the bank of some river, I shall blow out my brains, as surely as I am the son of the most honest man who has ever lived in France."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“听着，我亲爱的，我崇拜的凡兰蒂，”他用他那种和谐而庄重的语调说，“象我们这样无愧于社会，无愧于家人，也无愧于上帝的人，可以互相看到对方的心，象读一本打开的书一样。我从来不是一个罗曼蒂克的人，我不是悲剧的主角。我既不模仿曼弗雷特，也不模仿安东尼。但虽然不曾明言，不曾发誓，而我的生命却已经和你的缠结在一起。你要离开我，你这样做是对的——我再说一遍，你是对的。但丧失了你，我就丧失了我的生命。你一离我，凡兰蒂，我在世界上就只剩下孤零零地独自一个了。我的妹妹已幸福地结了婚，她的丈夫只是我法律上的兄弟——就是说，是一个和我只有社会关系的人。所以，没有一个人再需要我这无用的生命了。我预备这样做：我要等到你真正结婚的时候，因为我不愿意错过或许可以碰得到的那种意想不到的机会——因为说不定弗兰士先生会在那以前死掉。当你向圣坛走过去的时候，或许会落下一个霹雳来把他打得粉碎。在一个被判了死刑的人，没有哪一种事情看来是不可能的，只要能够死里逃生，奇迹似乎也成了很合理的事情。所以，我要等到那最后的一刻，当我的苦难已经确定，无可挽回，毫无希望的时候，我就写一封密书给我的妹夫，另外写一封给警察总监，把我的企图通知他们，然后，在一个树林的拐角上，在一个深谷的悬崖边，在一条河的堤岸旁，我就坚决地，正如我是法国一个最诚实的人的儿子那样坚决地了结我的残生。”">查看中文翻译</div>

I have many of them. If this affair were to come out, it would be a triumph that would make them leap for joy and cover me with shame. Forgive me these base thoughts.

<div class="line_en">The light had almost entirely disappeared from the red-curtained window. No doubt Mme de Villefort had just put out her lamp and only a night-light cast a flicker on the window-panes.

<div class="line_en">Although it was impossible for Valentine to see him where he was hiding, he thought he saw the shadow in the window motion to him: his troubled mind told him and his warm heart repeated this to him. The double error became a compelling reality and, with one of those incomprehensible impulses of youth, he leapt from his hiding-place, at the risk of being seen, or of terrifying Valentine and raising the alarm, were she to give an involuntary cry. In two bounds he crossed the flower garden that seemed in the moonlight as broad and white as a lake and, beyond the row of orange trees planted in boxes in front of the house, he reached the steps, ran up them and pushed the door, which opened freely before him.</div>

<div class="line_en">"So, not even the contract will be signed!" Morrel exclaimed. "Forgive me, Monsieur! One may be forgiven for doubting such happiness. The contract will not be signed?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那末甚至连婚约都不会签订了！”摩莱尔喊道。“噢，对不起，阁下？当一个人听到一个大喜讯的时候，是有权利表示怀疑的——婚约不会签订？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Are you telling me that it will not be signed?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“您向我保证它不会签订吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes," said Noirtier.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的。”诺梯埃说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No," said the invalid.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不会。”那个瘫子说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Despite this assurance, Morrel was reluctant to believe. Such a promise from a powerless old man was so strange that, instead of emanating from a powerful will, it might indicate a weakening of the faculties: is it not normal for a madman who does not know his own folly to claim that he can accomplish things that are beyond his power? A weak one speaks of the weights he can lift, a timorous one of the giants he can confront, the poor of the treasures he possesses and the most humble peasant, on account of his pride, is called Jupiter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但虽然有了这种保证，摩莱尔却依旧有点怀疑。一个瘫了的老人作出这种诺言，实在有点奇怪，这或许并不是他意志力强盛的表现而是他脑力衰弱的结果。疯人不知道自己痴呆，答应办到非他的力量所能控制的事情，这不是常有的事吗？气力弱小的人常常自夸能举重担，胆小的人自夸能打败巨人，穷人老是说他曾花掉多少财宝，最低贱的佃农，当他自吹自擂的时候，也会自称为宇宙大神。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Whether it was that Noirtier understood the young man's uncertainties or that he did not completely trust in the docility that he had shown, he stared hard at him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不知道诺梯埃究竟是因为懂得那个青年人的疑心呢，还是因为他还尚未十分相信他已顺从，总之，他始终坚定地望着他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What do you want, Monsieur?" Morrel asked. "That I should repeat my promise to do nothing?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“您有什么意思，阁下？”摩莱尔问道——“希望我重新向您申明一遍，说我愿意平心静气地等待吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Morrel indicated that he was ready to obey. "But first, Monsieur," he said, "will you allow your son to embrace you as your daughter did a moment ago?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="摩莱尔表示他愿意服从。“但是，”他说，“首先，阁下，您允不允许您的孙女婿拥抱您一下，就象刚才您的孙女儿所做的那样？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Outside, in the hall, he found the old servant, who had been told by Valentine to wait for him. He guided him down a dark winding corridor to a little door leading into the garden. Once there, Morrel went back to the gate past the arbour and, in a moment, was on top of the wall. A second later, thanks to his ladder, he was in the alfalfa field, where the cab was still waiting for him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他在门外找到巴罗斯。那个老仆人曾受过凡兰蒂的吩咐。他领摩莱尔沿着一条黑弄堂走，领他到一扇开向花园的小门口。摩莱尔不久就找到他进来的地点，他攀着树枝爬上墙顶，再靠他那把梯子的帮助，一会儿就已经到了那片苜蓿田里，他的轻便马车依旧在那儿等他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Morrel understood that the old man attached a great deal of importance to this oath. He held out his hand. "On my honour," he said, "I swear to you that I shall await your decision before I do anything against Monsieur d'Epinay."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="摩莱尔知道老人极其看重那个誓言。他举起一只手。“我凭我的人格向您发誓，”他说，“关于去找伊辟楠先生的那件事情，我一定等待您的决定。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He got in and, exhausted by all the day's emotions, but lighter in heart, he got home to the Rue Meslay at around midnight, threw himself on his bed and slept as deeply as though he were blind drunk.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他钻进车子里。虽然喜怒哀乐之情已把他弄得十分疲倦，但他心里的焦急却已减轻。他在午夜到达密斯雷路，把自己往床上一抛，就象一个喝得酩酊大醉的人那样睡着了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The young man put his lips on the old man's forehead at the very same place where the young woman had put hers. Then he bowed once more and went out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那个青年人在老人的前额上吻了一下，就吻在凡兰蒂吻过的那个地方。然后他再鞠一个躬，告退出去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes," the invalid replied with the same solemnity. "I do."</div>
