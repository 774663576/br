<div class="line_en">I on the other hand had a weak constitution. I couldn't digest any real food and lived on little more than coffee. My arms and legs were as thin as stems. And what work did I do there, you may well ask. I was chief garbage man for the dormitory.</div>

<div class="line_en">Our company had a big project to build a reinforced concrete reservoir out in a suburb surrounded by hills. At night a portion of the project was closed to us by means of a big square gate made of brass. One cold evening I was depositing the garbage from supper behind our dormitory when I saw a torch and the shape of a man passing through the grass gate. I walked over.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们公司有一个大项目，要在郊区群山环绕的地方修建一个钢筋混凝土水库。到 了晚上，工程的一部分通过一个黄铜制的大方门关闭了。一个寒冷的晚上，我正把晚饭后的垃圾放在宿舍后面，突然看见一个火把和一个男人的身影穿过草坪。我走过去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Of all the males in our company's dormitory, I felt the most affection for Tom. He was a genius, I thought, but the other guys took him for a nut. He came from far away, and at first had a strong Spanish accent. Now, after a year with the company, he spoke English very well. But his English accent had an exaggerated precision that the other guys didn't like. In the crude environment of the dormitory, Tom's accent seemed artificial. But he was a big man, a giant, and strong as an ox, and the others feared him and left him alone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在我们公司宿舍的所有男生中，我最喜欢汤姆。我认为他是个天才，但其他人都把他当成疯子。他是从很远的地方来的，一开始带着浓重的西班牙口音。现在，在公司工作一年后，他的英语说得非常好。但是他的英语口音有一种夸张的精确度，其他人不喜欢。在宿舍的简陋环境中，汤姆的口音显得矫揉造作。但是他是一个高大的男人，一个巨人，强壮如牛，其他人都怕他，留下他一个人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“调整？”他说。“我宁愿辞职。来吧。你在害怕什么？难道你不想调查一下这部分吗？”他知道是我干的。我和他在一起似乎已经是不可避免的了。我只是担心火炬会在首席看守的电视屏幕上显示出来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This giant crane was used for moving and placing the reinforced concrete blocks. In the dark we recognized it by its shape -- an immense pillar of zigzag rods. At the top of it, we knew, at the peak, would be the flag. And far over our heads, up in the dark sky, would be the crane's giant arm. On the arm was the banner that we saw everyday, with the letters ABC, the initial letters of our company's name. We had ABC written on our shirts, too, and on the chairs and beds with which our dormitory was furnished.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个巨大的起重机用来移动和放置钢筋混凝土。在黑暗中，我们可以通过它的形状认出它——一根巨大的之字形柱子。在它的顶端，我们知道，在顶端，将是一面旗帜。在我们的头顶上，在黑暗的天空中，是起重机的巨大臂膀。手臂上是我们每天都能看到的横幅，上面写着ABC，我们公司名字的首字母。我们的衬衫和宿舍里摆放的椅子和床上也都写着 ABC。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Let's go up!" said Tom. I laughed -- but Tome had spoken in earnest. Strong as he was, he really had no concept of authority.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="对着横幅？哦不这太过分了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Tom, you are a nut!" I said, wanting to show him that I was reluctant. But in the end he convinced me, and we mounted the ladder to the lift. There were two buttons, a red one and a green one. I pressed the latter, just to see if the lift might be operational. It was. I pressed the red button and stopped it. Tome got in. I pressed the green one again and we rose and rose and finally reached the top. We were at the peak of the pillar, just underneath the flag. Even in the dark we were close enough to see it. Before us the crane's giant arm led of like a road into the night. Its rods and all zigzag, made me feel that over there would be, I saw, a square gate, some garbage and a dormitory. But no. Off the end of that zigzag road really would be nothing but dark night. The geometry of the crane scared me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“汤姆，你是个疯子！”我说，想让他知道我不情愿。但是最后他说服了我，我们爬上梯子到了电梯。有两个纽扣，一个红的，一个绿的。我按了后一个按钮，只是想看看电梯是否能正常运行。是的。我按下红色按钮，停了下来。汤姆被录取了。我又按了一下那个绿色的，我们一起爬上去，最后到达了山顶。我们在柱子的顶端，就在国旗的下面。即使在黑暗中，我们也足够近地看到它。在我们面前的是一只巨大的鹤臂，它像一条通往黑夜的道路一样指引着我们。它的木条和所有的之字形，让我觉得在那里会有，我看到，一个正方形的大门，一些垃圾和一个宿舍。但是没有。弯弯曲曲的道路尽头真的只有漆黑的夜晚。起重机的几何形状吓了我一跳。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But he had set off. I was very scared, but somehow rose to the challenge and went with him. It became a contest: who would be the first one to touch the long banner? I was halfway along the arm when I heard the water of the reservoir, far underneath us. It was then that I remembered that the chief crane operator, before stopping his work for the day, would always swing the giant arm so that it projected out over the water.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但他出发了。我非常害怕，但不知怎么地，我挺身而出，和他一起走了。这变成了一场竞赛：谁会是第一个触摸长长的横幅的人？当我沿着胳膊走到一半的时候，我听到了水库的水声，就在我们脚下。就在那时，我想起了起重机总操作员，在停下他的工作一天之前，总是会挥动那个巨大的手臂，这样它就能在水面上投射出来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I possess the ABC!" he said, in that precise English of his. The dark shape on the arm put a thumb up to show me that he had got what he wanted. He put his other hand on what he thought was a rod, but it was the wire that would shock him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我掌握了基本知识！”他用他那一口流利的英语说道。手臂上的黑色轮廓竖起了大拇指，向我表明他得到了他想要的东西。他把另一只手放在他认为是杆子的东西上，但是电线会使他受到电击。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Tome never panicked. He looked at me as if I were far away. But his legs would not hold him up. Wrapped in the banner, he fell, like a baby bird from a nest. It was I who panicked, when I heard him hit and vanish underneath the water of the reservoir. Maybe his fall had not been fatal, but would my beloved Tom now drown? It was possible.</div>

<div class="line_en">We spent an anxious fortnight in the dormitory. While the others would talk about his vitality, I stared at jeans and socks of the vanishing nut.

<div class="line_cn" title="我们在宿舍里焦急地度过了两个星期。当其他人谈论他的活力时，我盯着消失的坚果的牛仔裤和袜子。没有他精确的英语，宿舍是个不同的地方。X光扫描显示他需要动手术。当然，这头大公牛必须从暴露在冷水中恢复过来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was a mention in the media of Tom's shock and fall, and the TV guys were going to come and see what we were doing at the reservoir project, until their investigation was canceled.

<div class="line_en">The company reinforced the square gate with more brass, and put a new box back onto the arm, screwing its nuts tightly.
