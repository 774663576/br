<div class="line_en">Very many years ago England was ruled over by a king, who was called Richard. More than a hundred years before this king began to rule England, a French duke named William came to England, defeated the English in a great battle, and declared himself king of all that southern part of Britain called England.</div>

<div class="line_en">He brought with him a great many Frenchmen, or Normans. These Normans were all poor though they were very proud. They came with Duke William to help him fight because he promised to give them money and lands as a reward. Now Duke William had not much money nor many lands of his own. So when he had beaten the English, he stole lands and houses, money and cattle from the English nobles and gave them to the Normans. The English nobles themselves had very often become the servants of these proud Normans. That is why two races lived in England, each speaking their own language, and each hating the other.</div>

<div class="line_en">Richard was a brave and noble man. He loved danger; he loved brave men and noble deeds. He hated all bad and cruel acts, and the cowards who did them. He was ever ready to help the weak against the strong, and had he stayed in England after he became king he might have done much good. He might have taught the proud Norman nobles that true nobility lies in being kind and gentle to those less strong and less fortunate than ourselves, and not in being fierce or cruel.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="理查是一位勇敢的贵族。他喜欢冒险，喜欢勇士和高贵的行为。他憎恶一切恶劣残忍的行为，也憎恶这样做的懦夫。他甚至乐意帮助弱者对抗强者。他成为国王后，如果继续呆在英格兰的话，他会做出许多善举的。也许他会教导高傲的诺曼贵族，让他们知道真正的高贵在于对不如自己强大、幸运的人善良而温和，而不是凶猛、残忍。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Yet Richard himself was not gentle. He was indeed very fierce and terrible in battle. He loved to fight with people who were stronger or better armed than himself. He would have been ashamed to hurt the weak.</div>

<div class="line_en">But Richard did not stay in England. Far, far over the seas there is a country called Palestine. There our Lord Jesus was born, lived, and died. But at this time it had fallen into the hands of people who were not Christians. It seemed to Christian people in those days that it would be terrible to allow those people to live in the Holy Land. So they gathered together great armies of brave men from every country in the world and sent them to try to win it back. Many terrible battles were fought, but still those people stayed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但理查没有待在英格兰。在大海外面非常遥远的地方，有一个国家名叫巴勒斯坦。那是我们的主耶稣诞生、生活、去世的地方，可当时这个国家落入了不是基督徒的人手中。在那些日子里，基督徒觉得允许那些人在这块圣地生活是非常可怕的事情，于是，他们一起从世界上各个国家集结了勇敢的大部队，并派他们尝试夺回这块圣地。他们发起多次残酷的战斗，但是那些人仍占据在那里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then brave King Richard of England said he too would fight for the city of our Lord. So he gathered together as much money as he could find, and as many brave men as would follow him, and set out for the Holy Land. Before he went away he called two bishops who he thought were good and wise men, and said to them: "Take care of England while I am gone. Rule my people wisely and well, and I will reward you when I return." The bishops promised to do as he asked. Then he said good-bye and sailed away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是，勇敢的英格兰理查国王说，他也要为这个国家的主人而战。于是，他尽其所能募集了大量的钱财，召集了大批愿意跟随他的人，然后动身前往圣地。临走之前，他叫来两个自己觉得善良而有智慧的主教，对他们说：“我不在的时候，你们掌管英格兰。用智慧管理好我的民众，等我回来的时候，我会奖赏你们的。”两个主教答应按照他的吩咐做，于是他跟他们道别，然后起航了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now King Richard had a brother who was called Prince John. Prince John was quite different from King Richard in every way. He was not at all a nice man. He was jealous of Richard because he was king, and angry because he himself had not been chosen to rule while Richard was in Palestine. As soon as his brother had gone, John went to the bishops and said, "You must let me rule the country while the king is away." And the bishops allowed him to do so. Deep down in his heart John meant to make himself king altogether, and never let Richard come back any more.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="理查国王有一个弟弟，名叫约翰亲王。约翰亲王在各个方面都不同于理查国王。他根本就不是一个好人。他因为理查当上了国王而妒忌他，理查去巴勒斯坦的时候没有选中他来统治，这让他非常恼火。他的哥哥一走，他就跟两个教主说：“国王不在的时候，你们必须让我来统治国家。”于是教主就同意了。而在内心深处，约翰想让自己做真正的国王，再也不让理查回来了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A sad time now began for the English people. John tried to please the proud Normans because they were great and powerful, and he hoped they would help to make him king. He thought the best way to please them was to give them land and money. So as he had none of his own, he took it from the English and gave it to the Normans. Thus many of the English people once more became homeless beggars, and lived a wild life in the forests, which covered a great part of England at this time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="英格兰人悲哀的时期开始了。约翰极力想讨好傲慢的诺曼人，因为他们实力强大，他希望他们会帮助他夺取王位。他觉得讨好他们最好的办法是给他们土地和金钱。但因为他自己没有这些，便从英格兰人那里掠夺来给诺曼人。就这样，许多英格兰人又一次变成无家可归的乞丐，在森林里过起了野外生活。当时英格兰大部分地区都被森林覆盖着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now among the few English nobles who still remained, and who had not been robbed of their lands and money, there was one called Robert, Earl of Huntingdon. He had one son also named Robert, but people called him Robin. He was a favourite with everyone. He was tall, strong, handsome, and full of fun, and he kept his father's house bright with songs and laughter. He was brave and fearless too, and there was no better archer in all the countryside. And although he shot the best in the country, he was gentle and tender, never hurting the weak nor looking down upon the poor.</div>

<div class="line_en">But Robert of Huntingdon had a bitter enemy. One day this enemy came with many soldiers behind him. They were determined to kill the earl and take all his goods and lands. There was a fierce and terrible fight, but in the end Robert and all his men were killed. His house was burned to the ground and all his money stolen. Only Robin was saved, because he was such a fine archer that no soldier would go near him. They could neither kill him nor take him prisoner. He fought bravely till the last, but when he saw that his father was dead and his home in flames, he had no heart to fight any longer. So taking his bow and arrows, he fled to the great forest of Sherwood.</div>

<div class="line_en">He had to run very fast, for Prince John's men were close behind him. Soon he reached the edge of the forest, but he did not stop there. On and on he went, going deeper and deeper under the shadow of the trees. At last he threw himself down under a great oak tree, burying his face in the cool, green grass.</div>
