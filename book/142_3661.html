<div class="line_en">The Corleone Family was finally forced to close down some of its most profitable bookmaking stations, including the book given to son-in-law Carlo Rizzi for his living. Carlo took to drink and running with chorus girls and giving his wife Connie a hard time. Since his beating at the hands of Sonny he had not dared to hit his wife again but he had not slept with her. Connie had thrown herself at his feet and he had spurned her, as he thought, like a Roman, with exquisite patrician pleasure. He had sneered at her, "Go call your brother and tell him I won't screw you, maybe he'll beat me up until I get a hard on."</div>

<div class="line_en">In any case, that spring and summer he mounts senseless raids on enemy auxiliaries. Tattaglia Family pimps were shot to death in Harlem, dock goons were massacred. Union officials who owed allegiance to the Five Families were warned to stay neutral, and when the Corleone bookmakers and shylocks were still barred from the docks, Sonny sent Clemenza and his regime to wreak havoc upon the long shore.</div>

<div class="line_en">This slaughter was senseless because it could not affect affect the outcome of the war. Sonny was a brilliant tactician and wears his brilliant victories.

<div class="line_en">Tom Hagen, as the Consigliere, disapproved of Sonny's tactics and yet decided not to protest to the Don simply because the tactics, to some extent, worked. The Five Families seemed to be cowed, finally, as the attrition went on, and their counterblows weakened and finally ceased altogether. Hagen at first distrusted this seeming pacification of the enemy but Sonny was jubilant. "I'll pour it on," he told Hagen, "and then those bastards will come begging for a deal."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="汤姆·黑根作为顾问，不赞成桑尼的战术，然而决定不轻易抵抗老头战术，因为某种程度上来说是可行的。随着他继续的损耗和削弱，最终完全消失，五大家族似乎被吓到。哈根起初怀疑这种看似平定敌不过桑尼欣喜若狂。”“我来干倒他们，”他对哈根说，“然后那些混蛋就来乞求交易。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But he was in deadly fear of Sonny though they treated each other with cold politeness. Carlo had the sense to realize that Sonny would kill him, that Sonny was a man who could, with the naturalness of an animal, kill another man, while he himself would have to call up all his courage, all his will, to commit murder. It never occurred to Carlo that because of this he was a better man than Sonny Corleone, if such terms could be used; he envied Sonny his awesome savagery, a savagery which was now becoming a legend.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是他对桑尼却非常害怕，尽管他们冷漠地对待对方。卡罗意识到桑尼会杀了他，因为桑尼是一个能够以他本性杀人的人，而他自己则需要鼓起他所有的勇气和意志去杀人。没想到卡罗，因为他是一个比桑尼更好的男人，如果这样的条款可以使用；他羡慕桑尼可怕的野性和野蛮，现在已经是一个传奇。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sonny was worried about other things. His wife was giving him a hard time because the rumors had gotten to her that Lucy Mancini had bewitched her husband.

<div class="line_en">The Don was recovering and would soon be able to resume command. At that time the tide of battle must swing to the Corleone Family. This Sonny was sure of. Meanwhile he would guard his Family's empire, earn the respect of his father, and, since the position was not hereditary to an absolute degree, cement his claim as heir to the Corleone Empire.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="老头子在恢复健康，很快就会重新掌权，到那时候，战局肯定会发生有利于考利昂家族的变化。对这一点，桑儿是有把握的。另外，在他捍卫他的家族帝国的同时，他还要赢得他父亲对他的赏识，因为家族帝国的地位并不一定是长子继承，他还得巩固自己对考利昂帝国的继承权。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But the enemy was making its plans. They too had analyzed the situation and had come to the conclusion that the only way to stave off complete defeat was to kill Sonny Corleone. They understood the situation better now and felt it was possible to negotiate with the Don, known for his logical reasonableness. They had come to hate Sonny for his bloodthirstiness, which they considered barbaric. Also not good business sense. Nobody wanted the old days back again with all its turmoil and trouble.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，敌人也在分析局势，并得出了结论：避免彻底失败的唯一办法就是干掉桑儿·考利昂。他们这时对形势的理解更进了一步，认为同老头子谈判解决问题还是可能的，因为老头子一贯通情达理的作风是人所共知的。他们开始痛恨桑儿那种嗜血成性的作风，认为这种作风实在野蛮，而且还缺乏生意人的敏锐的嗅觉，谁也不愿意再出现那种兵荒马乱的局面了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In addition to this Sonny was under the enormous strain of being a marked man. He had to be extraordinarily careful in all his movements and he knew that his visits to Lucy Mancini had been charted by the enemy. But here he took elaborate precautions since this was the traditional vulnerable spot. He was safe there. Though Lucy had not the slightest suspicion, she was watched twenty-four hours a day by men of the Santino regime and when an apartment became vacant on her floor it was immediately rented by one of the most reliable men of that regime.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="除此之外，桑尼承受着作为一个大难临头的人的。他在行动中必须格外小心，他所有的行为已被敌人记录下来了，因为这是他长期以来的致命弱点，所以他在这方面也防范得很严密。虽然璐西一点也没有觉察，但她一天二十四小时都受到了桑迪诺兵团的监护：一旦她那层楼有一套房间空出来了，马上就由桑迪诺兵团最可靠的士兵租用下来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Pretty soon she wouldn't be able to do anything, the doctor had said no sex for the last two months and she wanted it, before the last two months started. Yet her wish to inflict a physical injury on Carlo was very real too. She followed him into the bedroom.</div>

He hit her again and again as she retreated around the kitchen table trying to escape him and he pursued her into the bedroom. She tried to bite his hand and he grabbed her by the hair to lift her head up. He slapped her face until she began to weep like a little girl, with pain and humiliation.

<div class="line_en">Hagen knew the look on Sonny's face, all reasoning power had left him. At this moment Sonny was capable of anything. Hagen also knew that the ride into the city would cool Sonny off, make him more rational. But that rationality might make him even more dangerous, though the rationality would enable him to protect himself against the consequences of his rage. Hagen heard the car motor roaring into life and he said to the two bodyguards, "Go after him."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="黑根知道桑儿脸上的神色表明他已经彻底失去理性。在此刻，桑儿什么事情也干得出来。黑根还知道坐汽车到城里逛一逛会使桑儿冷静下来，变得理智一些。但是，也可能促使他变得对别人甚至更加危险，虽然理智也会促使他保护自己，免于自己的狂怒可能造成的恶果。黑根听到汽车轰轰隆隆地发动起来了，就对那两个保镖说：“快去跟在他后面。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then he went to the phone and made some calls. He arranged for some men of Sonny's regime living in the city to go up to Carlo Rizzi's apartment and get Carlo out of there. Other men would stay with Connie until Sonny arrived. He was taking a chance, thwarting Sonny, but he knew the Don would back him up. He was afraid that Sonny might kill Carlo in front of witnesses. He did not expect trouble from the enemy. The Five Families had been quiet too long and obviously were looking for peace of some kind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后，他打了几个电话。他安排桑儿兵团中住在城里的几个将士快到卡罗·瑞泽家里去，设法让卡罗不要待在家里。另外几个将士守在康妮跟前，等待桑儿到达。黑根想抢先一步，让桑儿扑个空，他知道老头子是会支持他的。他担心的是桑儿可能打死卡罗。他预计敌人是不会制造什么麻烦的。五大家族已经好久不见有什么行动了，显然是在寻求某种和平。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The paradox in Sonny's violent nature was that he could not hit a woman and had never done so. That he could not harm a child or anything helpless. When Carlo had refused to fight back against him that day, it had kept Sonny from killing him; complete submission disarmed his violence. As a boy, he had been truly tenderhearted. That he had become a murderer as a man was simply his destiny.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="桑儿残暴的性格中的另一面乃是他不忍心打击女人，也真的从来没有打击过女人；他不忍心伤害儿童或其他软弱无力的人或动物。卡罗那天骂不还口、打不还手，这才使桑儿不忍心打死他，彻底卑恭屈膝的可怜相解除了桑儿的武装。小时候，他原来也是心慈手软的。长大成人，他变成杀人不眨眼的刽子年，这完全是他的命运后来决定的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">By the time Sonny roared out of the mall in his Buick, he had already regained, partly, his senses. He noted the two bodyguards getting into a car to follow him and approved. He expected no danger, the Five Families had quit counterattacking, were not really fighting anymore. He had grabbed his jacket in the foyer and there was a gun in a secret dashboard compartment of the car, the car registered in the name of a member of his regime, so that he personally could not get into any legal trouble. But he did not anticipate needing any weapon. He did not even know what he was going to do with Carlo Rizzi.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="桑儿开着他的比尤克牌汽车，轰轰隆隆地冲出了林荫道，这时他已经恢复了或部分恢复了他的理智。他看到那两个保镖上了一辆汽车，跟随在后面，他也默许他们跟随在后面。他预料不会出什么危险，五大家族早已不再进行反击，不再认真打仗了、汽车仪表后面的秘密小柜里有一支小手枪；这辆汽车是登记在桑儿兵团的一个成员名下的，因此在法律上他个人也不会遇到什么麻烦。但是，照他的预计，并不需要什么武器。他甚至也不知道他将如何处置卡罗·瑞泽。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now that he had a chance to think, Sonny knew he could not kill the father of an unborn child, and that father his sister's husband. Not over a domestic spat. Except that it was not just a domestic spat. Carlo was a bad guy and Sonny felt responsible that his sister had met the bastard through him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时，他有机会好好想一想了：他知道不能去杀死一个未出世婴儿的父亲，尤其因为这个父亲就是他妹妹的丈夫。他更不应该因为两口子吵架就杀人。卡罗是个坏蛋，桑儿感到自己也有责任，因为妹妹是通过他才认识这个小杂种的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He had taken the Jones Beach Causeway, as always, because it was usually deserted this time of night, at this time of year, and he could speed recklessly until he hit the parkways on the other side. And even there traffic would be light. The release of driving very fast would help dissipate what he knew was a dangerous tension. He had already left his bodyguards car far behind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他已经上了琼斯海滩堤道。因为在一年中的这个季节，在晚上的这个时候，这条路通常早没有车子来往了，所以就像以往一样，他把汽车开得飞快，一直高速行驶到对岸的大路，甚至在对岸的大路上，来往车辆也还是很少的。他先把汽车开得非常快，然后渐渐减速。他把他保镖的汽车远远扔在后面了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He decided he would send Connie home with the bodyguards and then he would have a session with his brotherin-law. What would happen after that he didn't know.

<div class="line_en">Sonny handed the toll taker the dollar bill and waited for his change. He was in a hurry now to close the window. The Atlantic Ocean air had chilled the whole car. But the toll taker was fumbling with his change; the dumb son of a bitch actually dropped it. Head and body disappeared as the toll man stooped down in his booth to pick up the money.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="桑儿把大钞票递给收费员，等人家补零钱。这时，他趁机急急忙忙关上窗子，大西洋的夜风，吹在身上凉嗖嗖的；但是，那个收费员把零钱拿在手中摸来摸去，实际上零钱掉下去了，收费员弯下腰去捡钱时，头和身子都不见了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The causeway was badly lit, there was not a single car. Far ahead he saw the white cone of the manned tollbooth. There were other tollbooths beside it but they were staffed only during the day, for heavier traffic. Sonny started braking the Buick and at the same time searched his pockets for change. He had none. He reached for his wallet, flipped it open with one hand and fingered out a bill. He came within the arcade of light and he saw to his mild surprise a car in the tollbooth slot blocking it, the driver obviously asking some sort of directions from the toll taker. Sonny honked his horn and the other car obediently rolled through to let his car slide into the slot.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="堤道上的灯光照明很糟糕，连一辆汽车也没有。在前面很远的地方，他看到了有个管理收费站的白色锥形小屋，旁边还有几个收费站的小屋，但这几个小屋只是在白天来往车辆行人比较多的时候，里面才有人守着。桑儿一面慢慢停车，一面在衣袋里摸零钱。他没有零钱，便摸出皮夹子，从里面拍出一张大钞票。他把车子开进了有拱顶的明亮通道。他感到吃惊的是，一辆汽车堵住了收费站设置的狭窄通道，司机显然是向收费员问什么。桑儿按按喇叭，那辆车乖乖地向前开会了，好让他的汽车沿途狭窄通道。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Even so, his huge body in a reflex for life crashed against the Buick door, bursting its lock. The man in the darkened tollbooth opened fire and the shots caught Sonny Corleone in the head and neck as his massive frame spilled out of the car. The two men in front held up their guns now, the man in the darkened tollbooth cut his fire, and Sonny's body sprawled on the asphalt with the legs still partly inside. The two men each fired shots into Sonny's body, then kicked him in the face to disfigure his features even more, to show a mark made by a more personal human power.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="即使如此，他那高大的身躯立刻作出了死里逃生的本能反应，迅速向车门冲去种破了锁子。躲在黑暗处的那个人突然开火了，当桑儿·考利昂那高大的身躯刚要冲出车门的那一刹那，子弹打中了他的头和脖子。这时，前面那两个人也举起了枪，躲在黑暗小屋里的那个人不再射击。桑儿扑倒在沥青路面上，半截腿还在车门里面。那两个人又向桑儿的身子开火，然后用脚踢他的脸。他们把他的面孔踢得更加不像样子，目的就是要留下出于报私仇而蛮干的痕迹。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At that moment Sonny noticed that the other car had not kept going but had parked a few feet ahead, still blocking his way. At that same moment his lateral vision caught sight of another man in the darkened tollbooth to his right. But he did not have time to think about that because two men came out of the car parked in front and walked toward him. The toll collector still had not appeared. And then in the fraction of a second before anything actually happened, Santino Corleone knew he was a dead man. And in that moment his mind was lucid, drained of all violence, as if the hidden fear finally real and present had purified him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此刻，桑儿发现那辆汽车没有一直向前开去，而是停在前面几英尺的地方，仍然堵着路，同时，他从前面瞥见了右边没有开灯的收费站小屋里还躲着一个人；但是，他来不及考虑这个了，说时迟那时快，一辆汽车突如其来地停在他的面前，从里面下来了两个人朝他走来。那个收费员仍然不见影子。他恍然大悟：自己活不成了。此刻，他的头脑是清醒的，但他的残暴性彻底耗尽了，好像最后的、实实在在地出现在他眼前的危险，使他受到了净化。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Seconds afterward, all four men, the three actual assassins and the bogus toll collector, were in their car and speeding toward the Meadowbrook Parkway on the other side of Jones Beach. Their pursuit was blocked by Sonny's car and body in the tollgate slot but when Sonny's bodyguards pulled up a few minutes later and saw his body lying there, they had no intention to pursue. They swung their car around in a huge arc and returned to Long Beach. At the first public phone off the causeway one of them hopped out and called Tom Hagen. He was very curt and very brisk. "Sonny's dead, they got him at the Jones Beach toll."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="几秒钟之后，那四个人——三个刺客和那个冒充的收费员——全都上了他们的那辆汽车，向着对岸的琼斯海滩上的“草溪大路”扬长而去。而从后面追逐凶手的人给挡住了去路：桑儿的汽车和他的尸体堵住了收费站小屋前狭窄的通道。几分钟之后，桑儿的保镖赶到现场，发现桑儿的尸体躺在那儿，却无意去追赶凶手。他们开着汽车兜了个大圈子，回到长滩岛。在离堤道不远的第一个公用电话站，其中一个跳下来给汤姆·黑根打了个电话。他汇报得非常简短、非常干脆。“桑儿给打死了，地点在琼斯滩堤道收费站。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Hagen had taken the call in the kitchen, with Mama Corleone bustling around preparing a snack for the arrival of her daughter. He had kept his composure and the old woman had not noticed anything amiss. Not that she could not have, if she wanted to, but in her life with the Don she had learned it was far wiser not to perceive. That if it was necessary to know something painful, it would be told to her soon enough. And if it was a pain that could be spared her, she could do without. She was quite content not to share the pain of her men, after all did they share the pain of women? Impassively she boiled her coffee and set the table with food. In her experience pain and fear did not dull physical hunger; in her experience the taking of food dulled pain. She would have been outraged if a doctor had tried to sedate her with a drug, but coffee and a crust of bread were another matter; she came, of course, from a more primitive culture.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="黑根是在厨房接的电话，考利昂夫人在厨房里忙碌，为她女儿准备快餐。他一直装得面不改色；老太太根本看不出出了什么祸事。如果她有心的话，本来也是可以觉察得出来的，但是她同老头子长期在一起生活，悟出了一个道理，那就是：不要多管闲事，不要察言观色，才是更为明智的态度。如果有什么事情她必须知道，人家也会及时告诉她；如果有一种事情不让她知道，她不知道也行。不分担家中男人们的痛苦，她是心安理得的。话又说回来，难道男人又分担女人的痛苦吗？她毫无表情地煮她的咖啡，给餐桌上摆菜肴。就她的经验来说，精神上的痛苦和恐惧并不能减弱肉体上的饥饿，吃饭可以减弱痛苦。如果医生想用药品使她镇静下来，那她就会勃然大怒。这当然是因为她从小受到的是比较原始的文化熏陶。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He was, he knew now, no fit Consigliere for a Family at war. He had been fooled, faked out, by the Five Families and their seeming timidity. They had remained quiet, laying their terrible ambush. They had planned and waited, holding their bloody hands no matter what provocation they had been given. They had waited to land one terrible blow. And they had. Old Genco Abbandando would never have fallen for it, he would have smelled a rat, he would have smoked them out, tripled his precautions. And through all this Hagen felt his grief. Sonny had been his true brother, his savior; his hero when they had been boys together. Sonny had never been mean or bullying with him, had always treated him with affection, had taken him in his arms when Sollozzo had turned him loose. Sonny's joy at that reunion had been real. That he had grown up to be a cruel and violent and bloody man was, for Hagen, not relevant.</div>

<div class="line_en">He would have to waken the Don from his drugged slumber. He would have to tell the man he most loved in the world that he had failed him, that he had failed to guard his domain and the life of his eldest son. He would have to tell the Don everything was lost unless the sick man himself could enter the battle. For Hagen did not delude himself. Only the great Don himself could snatch even a stalemate from this terrible defeat. Hagen didn't even bother checking with Don Corleone's doctors, it would be to no purpose. No matter what the doctors ordered, even if they told him that the Don could not rise from his sickbed on pain of death, he must tell his adoptive father and then follow him. And of course there was no question about what the Don would do. The opinions of medical men were irrelevant now, everything was irrelevant now. The Don must be told and he must either take command or order Hagen to surrender the Corleone power to the Five Families.</div>

<div class="line_en">And yet with all his heart, Hagen dreaded the next hour. He tried to prepare his own manner. He would have to be in all ways strict with his own guilt. To reproach himself would only add to the Don's burden. To show his own grief would only sharpen the grief of the Don. To point out his own shortcomings as a wartime Consigliere, would only make the Don reproach himself for his own bad judgment for picking such a man for such an important post.</div>

<div class="line_en">Hagen lifted his head at the sound of motors, cars rolling up onto the mall. The caporegimes were arriving. He would brief them first and then he would go up and wake Don Corleone. He got up and went to the liquor cabinet by the desk and took out a glass and bottle. He stood there for a moment so unnerved he could not pour the liquid from bottle to glass. Behind him, he heard the door to the room close softly and, turning, he saw, fully dressed for the first time since he had been shot, Don Corleone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="黑根一听到发动机的轰隆隆声马上就抬起头来，有几辆汽车向林荫道开来。司令们快到了，他打算首先向他们简要地介绍一下情况，然后就上楼去叫醒考利昂老头子。他站起来，走向办公桌旁的酒柜，取出一个玻璃杯和一瓶酒，他站在那儿就像魂不附体似的，甚至酒也不能倒进玻璃杯了，他蓦地听到后面的房门轻轻地关上了，回头一看，原来是自从遭到枪击以来第一次穿得衣帽整齐的考利昂老头子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Don walked across the room to his huge leather armchair and sat down. He walked a little stiffly, his clothes hung a little loosely on his frame but to Hagen's eyes he looked the same as always. It was almost as if by his will alone the Don had discarded all external evidence of his still weakened frame. His fact was sternly set with all its old force and strength. He sat straight in the armchair and he said to Hagen, "Give me a drop of anisette."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="老头子走了个穿堂过，到了他那宽大的皮椅跟前坐下来。他步态有点僵硬，身上的衣服显得有点宽大，像是松松地挂在身上似的。但是在黑根看来，他同往常一模一样。他的面容坚定，显示出来的威力和韧性不减当初。他直挺挺地坐在扶手椅里，对黑根说：“给我一点茴香酒。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Hagen switched bottles and poured them both a portion of the fiery, licorice-tasting alcohol. It was peasant, homemade stuff, much stronger than that sold in stores, the gift of an old friend who every year presented the Don with a small truckload.</div>
