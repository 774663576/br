<div class="line_en">Park stood up when she got to their row, and as soon as she sat down, he took her hand and kissed it. It happened so fast, she didn't have time to die of ecstasy or embarrassment.</div>

<div class="line_en">Eleanor couldn't bring herself to smile directly back at him, not in front of everybody. But she couldn't help but smile, so she smiled at the floor and looked up every few seconds to see whether he was still looking at her.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Eleanor, wake up! You've got a pass from your counselor." God, he was a jerk, she was glad she didn't have him for a real class. As she walked to the office, she trailed her fingertips along the brick wall and hummed a song Park had given her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“埃莉诺，醒醒！你的辅导老师给了你通行证。”天啊，他真是个混蛋，埃莉诺真庆幸自己没有他的任何一门课。她走向教师办公室，指尖滑过砖墙，哼着帕克录给她的歌。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You know," Mrs Dunne said, "you can come use my phone whenever you need to." She stood up and sat on the edge of her desk, resting her hand on Eleanor's knee. Eleanor was this close to asking for a toothbrush, but she thought that would lead to a marathon of hugging and knee-rubbing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="唐恩太太说：“只要有需要，你都可以来用我的电话。”她站起身，靠着桌边，手放在埃莉诺的膝盖上。埃莉诺差点就要开口跟她要一支牙刷了，但是她知道，这会带来马拉松式的拥抱。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="跟他说他们没电话是没用的。指出他们有电话时爸爸从不回电也没用。他才该想办法跟他们通话，毕竟他是那个有电话、有车，还有自己生活的人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他说：“我有个很酷的提议，或许你周五晚上可以过来。”埃莉诺的爸爸有电视人的声音，就是那种企图在电视上兜售唱片合辑，比如七十年代的畅销迪斯科舞曲，或者《时代生活杂志》推出的最新合辑的人。">查看中文翻译</div>
