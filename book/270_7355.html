<div class="line_en">Jacob leaned back against my knees and toyed with the hot dog he had spitted on a straightened wire hanger; the flames at the edge of the bonfire licked along its blistered skin. He heaved a sigh and patted his stomach. It was somehow still flat, though I'd lost count of how many hot dogs he'd eaten after his tenth. Not to mention the super-sized bag of chips or the two-liter bottle of root beer.</div>

<div class="line_en">I wondered how horrible it was for Leah to sit across the circle from Sam and Emily. Her lovely face betrayed no emotion, but she never looked away from the flames. Looking at the perfection of Leah's features, I couldn't help but compare them to Emily's ruined face. What did Leah think of Emily's scars, now that she knew the truth behind them? Did it seem like justice in her eyes?</div>

<div class="line_en">It wasn't just kids in attendance, either. Billy was here, his wheelchair stationed at what seemed the natural head of the circle. Beside him on a folding lawn chair, looking quite brittle, was Quil's ancient, white-haired grandfather, Old Quil. Sue Clearwater, widow of Charlie's friend Harry, had a chair on his other side; her two children, Leah and Seth, were also there, sitting on the ground like the rest of us. This surprised me, but all three were clearly in on the secret now. From the way Billy and Old Quil spoke to Sue, it sounded to me like she'd taken Harry's place on the council. Did that make her children automatic members of La Push's most secret society?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="参加的也不仅仅是孩子们。比利也在，他坐在轮椅上，别的人围在他周围坐成一圈，这似乎是自然而然的事情。吉尔的祖父、白发苍苍的爷爷老吉尔坐在比利旁边的一张折叠式户外小椅子上，他看起来十分冷漠。苏·克里尔沃特、查理的朋友哈里的遗孀坐在他另一侧的椅子上。寡妇的两个孩子里尔和塞思也都在那里，和我们其他人一样席地而坐。这令我感到惊讶不已，不过这三个人现在显然已经知道了秘密。从比利和老吉尔与苏说话的方式来看，在我听来好像她已经取代了哈里在长老会的位置。这使她的孩子们自动地成为拉普西最秘密的组织成员了吗？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="小塞思·克里尔沃特不再幼小了。他脸上挂着满心欢喜的笑容，体型修长，他让我想起年纪稍小时的雅各布。这种相似令我会心一笑，接着又叹了叹气。塞思命中注定要和其他的男孩子一样经历生活的剧变吗？是不是正是因为这样的未来，他和他的家人才来到这里呢？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">My first impression of Kim was that she was a nice girl, a little shy, and a little plain. She had a wide face, mostly cheekbones, with eyes too small to balance them out. Her nose and mouth were both too broad for traditional beauty. Her flat black hair was thin and wispy in the wind that never seemed to let up atop the cliff.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我对琪姆的第一印象是她是个很善良的女孩子，有些害羞，有些平凡。她的脸庞较宽，主要是颧骨，而眼睛又很小，整个脸不太对称。她的鼻子和嘴巴都太大了，不符合传统的审美标准。而她那平整服帖的黑头发在风中显得太薄、太稀疏，似乎永远无法在头顶上绾成发髻。">查看中文翻译</div>
