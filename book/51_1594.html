<div class="line_en">The anthem booms in my ears, and then I hear Caesar Flickerman greeting the audience. Does he know how crucial it is to get every word right from now on? He must. He will want to help us. The crowd breaks into applause as the prep teams are presented. I imagine Flavius, Venia, and Octavia bouncing around and taking ridiculous, bobbing bows. It's a safe bet they're clueless. Then Effie's introduced. How long she's waited for this moment. I hope she's able to enjoy it because as misguided as Effie can be, she has a very keen instinct about certain things and must at least suspect we're in trouble. Portia and Cinna receive huge cheers, of course, they've been brilliant, had a dazzling debut. I now understand Cinna's choice of dress for me for tonight. I'll need to look as girlish and innocent as possible. Haymitch's appearance brings a round of stomping that goes on at least five minutes. Well, he's accomplished a first. Keeping not only one but two tributes alive. What if he hadn't warned me in time? Would I have acted differently? Flaunted the moment with the berries in the Capitol's face? No, I don't think so. But I could easily have been a lot less convincing than I need to be now. Right now. Because I can feel the plate lifting me up to the stage.</div>

<div class="line_en">Finally, Haymitch interrupts us and gives us a good-natured shove toward the victor's chair. Usually, this is a single, ornate chair from which the winning tribute watches a film of the highlights of the Games, but since there are two of us, the Gamemakers have provided a plush red velvet couch. A small one, my mother would call it a love seat, I think. I sit so close to Peeta that I'm practically on his lap, but one look from Haymitch tells me it isn't enough. Kicking off my sandals, I tuck my feet to the side and lean my head against Peeta's shoulder. His arm goes around me automatically, and I feel like I'm back in the cave, curled up against him, trying to keep warm. His shirt is made of the same yellow material as my dress, but Portia's put him in long black pants. No sandals, either, but a pair of sturdy black boots he keeps solidly planted on the stage. I wish Cinna had given me a similar outfit, I feel so vulnerable in this flimsy dress. But I guess that was the point.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后，还是黑密斯打断了我们，善意地把我们推到胜利者坐席。通常，这是一个单人的、装饰华丽的座椅，胜利者在这里观看比赛中的精彩场面，可这次因为有我们两个人，大赛组织者为我们准备了一张盖着红色天鹅绒的长沙发。沙发不大，我妈妈会叫它爱人沙发，我想。我坐得离皮塔这么近，简直像是坐在他的腿上，可黑密斯丢给我一个眼色，意思是我们离得还不够近。我脱掉凉鞋，把腿弯起来，头枕在皮塔的肩上，他的手臂很自然地环住了我。我感觉像是又回到了石洞里，为保持体温紧紧依偎在皮塔身旁。他的衬衫与我的是同样的黄色，但波西娅让他穿了黑色的长裤。脚上没穿凉鞋，而是穿着结实的黑靴子，稳重而踏实。我真希望西纳也给我设计了类似的服装，我穿着这飘逸的裙装，觉得自己很孱弱。可也许西纳要的正是这个。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Blinding lights. The deafening roar rattles the metal under my feet. Then there's Peeta just a few yards away. He looks so clean and healthy and beautiful, I can hardly recognize him. But his smile is the same whether in mud or in the Capitol and when I see it, I take about three steps and fling myself into his arms. He staggers back, almost losing his balance, and that's when I realize the slim, metal contraption in his hand is some kind of cane. He rights himself and we just cling to each other while the audience goes insane. He's kissing me and all the time I'm thinking, Do you know? Do you know how much danger we're in? After about ten minutes of this, Caesar Flickerman taps on his shoulder to continue the show, and Peeta just pushes him aside without even glancing at him. The audience goes berserk. Whether he knows or not, Peeta is, as usual, playing the crowd exactly right.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="刺眼的光线，如雷的吼声，震得我脚下的金属盘微微颤抖。之后皮塔登台，距我只有几码远。他看上去是那么的干净、漂亮、健康，我几乎认不出他了。可他脸上灿然的微笑一如从前，无论是在泥地里、在凯匹特，还是任何我看见他的时候。我三步并作两步，一下子扑到他的怀里。他向后退了两步，差点失去平衡，这时我看到他手里拿着的一个纤巧的原以为是金属的盒子原来是藤编的。他站稳脚跟，我们紧紧拥抱在一起，观众都疯狂了。他亲吻着我，而我一直在想：“你知道我们又有危险了吗？”大约过了十分钟，凯撒·弗里克曼拍拍皮塔的肩膀，示意欢庆仪式继续。可皮塔连看都没看就一把推开了他，观众更为之疯狂了。不管皮塔是否意识到，他一如平常，恰到好处地调动了观众的情绪。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Condensing several weeks into three hours is quite a feat, especially when you consider how many cameras were going at once. Whoever puts together the highlights has to choose what sort of story to tell. This year, for the first time, they tell a love story. I know Peeta and I won, but a disproportionate amount of time is spent on us, right from the beginning. I'm glad though, because it supports the whole crazy-in-love thing that's my defense for defying the Capitol, plus it means we won't have as much time to linger over the deaths.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="把过去数个星期的时间浓缩成三个小时，的确很不简单，特别是在许多台摄像机同时拍下大量录像的情况下，片子的剪辑者要突出某个主题。今年，他们第一次拥有了一个爱情主题。很显然，我和皮塔赢得了比赛，但有关我们的内容多得不合比例，从一开始便是如此。可是我也很高兴，因为这凸显我们的恋爱故事，也就是说，我们在面对死亡时，没时间多想，也为对凯匹特的蔑视行为找到了合适的理由。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Caesar Flickerman makes a few more jokes, and then it's time for the show. This will last exactly three hours and is required viewing for all of Panem. As the lights dim and the seal appears on the screen, I realize I'm unprepared for this. I do not want to watch my twenty-two fellow tributes die. I saw enough of them die the first time. My heart starts pounding and I have a strong impulse to run. How have the other victors faced this alone? During the highlights, they periodically show the winner's reaction up on a box in the corner of the screen. I think back to earlier years… some are triumphant, pumping their fists in the air, beating their chests. Most just seem stunned. All I know is that the only thing keeping me on this love seat is Peeta -- his arm around my shoulder, his other hand claimed by both of mine. Of course, the previous victors didn't have the Capitol looking for a way to destroy them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凯撒·弗里克曼又开了几句玩笑，接着正式仪式开始。这节目要持续大约三个小时，而帕纳姆全国人都要求收看。光线变暗，屏幕上出现市徽，我突然觉得我并没有做好心理准备，我不想观看我的二十二个同伴死去的过程，第一次看他们死已经够了。我的心跳得厉害，又有跑掉的强烈冲动。其他的胜利者怎么能独自面对这一切？在精彩场面回放过程中，一个小画中画，不停显示此时胜利者的反应。我回想以前的许多年节目播放时，一些胜利者表现出胜利的喜悦，一些人在空中挥舞拳头，一些人捶自己的胸部，而多数胜利者只是吃惊。我知道我现在仍然能够坐在这张爱人沙发上的唯一原因是皮塔。他用胳膊搂着我的肩，他的另一手拉着我的两只手。当然了，所不同的是，以前的胜利者并没有一个等着摧毁他们的凯匹特。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Once we're in the arena, there's detailed coverage of the bloodbath and then the filmmakers basically alternate between shots of tributes dying and shots of us. Mostly Peeta really, there's no question he's carrying this romance thing on his shoulders. Now I see what the audience saw, how he misled the Careers about me, stayed awake the entire night under the tracker jacker tree, fought Cato to let me escape and even while he lay in that mud bank, whispered my name in his sleep. I seem heartless in comparison -- dodging fireballs, dropping nests, and blowing up supplies -- until I go hunting for Rue. They play her death in full, the spearing, my failed rescue attempt, my arrow through the boy from District 1's throat, Rue drawing her last breath in my arms. And the song. I get to sing every note of the song. Something inside me shuts down and I'm too numb to feel anything. It's like watching complete strangers in another Hunger Games. But I do notice they omit the part where I covered her in flowers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接下来是竞技场中的比赛情况，片子对血腥搏杀的每一个细节都不放过，并时不时地在选手的死亡场面和我们的现场情况之间转换。事实上，毫无疑问，皮塔肩负着上演这一浪漫故事的主要任务。现在我可以站在观众的角度观看这一切——在追踪蜂袭击他们之前的夜晚，他整晚没睡，和加图明争暗斗，试图让我逃脱；他躺在河岸的泥淖中，睡梦中还在轻声呼唤我的名字。相比之下，我却显得冷酷无情——躲避火球袭击，向职业选手扔蜂巢，炸掉补给品——直到我寻找露露时，情况才有所改变。片子全程播放了她的死亡过程，怎样被矛击中，我怎样救她，我怎样一箭射中一区男孩的喉咙，露露怎样在我怀里咽气，以及我为她唱歌的场面。看到这儿，我觉得难过极了，对周围一切的感觉都麻木了，就像观看另一次饥饿游戏中的陌生人。可我也注意到他们没有播放我给露露身上放花的情景。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The first half hour or so focuses on the pre-arena events, the reaping, the chariot ride through the Capitol, our training scores, and our interviews.

<div class="line_cn" title="开始的三十分钟左右，主要回顾了赛前的精彩场面，战车穿过凯匹特，我们的训练成绩，我们的电视访谈。电视画面中出现的一次次的欢呼声让人更觉凄惨，因为片中出现的所有的人几乎全部亡故。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The anthem's playing yet again and we rise as President Snow himself takes the stage followed by a little girl carrying a cushion that holds the crown. There's just one crown, though, and you can hear the crowd's confusion -- whose head will he place it on? -- until President Snow gives it a twist and it separates into two halves. He places the first around Peeta's brow with a smile. He's still smiling when he settles the second on my head, but his eyes, just inches from mine, are as unforgiving as a snake's.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="国歌再次响起，斯诺总统站在台中央，身后的小女孩手捧着王冠，王冠放置在一只绒枕上。然而绒枕上只有一顶王冠，可以听到台下的观众在窃窃私语，这顶王冠要放在谁的头上？这时，斯诺总统用手一扭，出现了两顶王冠。他面带微笑，把一顶王冠戴在皮塔的头上；他给我戴另一顶王冠时，脸上仍带着微笑，但在距我只有数英寸远的眼神里，透出的分明是不肯原谅我的严厉目光。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Things pick up for me once they've announced two tributes from the same district can live and I shout out Peeta's name and then clap my hands over my mouth. If I've seemed indifferent to him earlier, I make up for it now, by finding him, nursing him back to health, going to the feast for the medicine, and being very free with my kisses. Objectively, I can see the mutts and Cato's death are as gruesome as ever, but again, I feel it happens to people I have never met.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="画面中再次出现我的镜头。当他们宣布同一个区可以有两名选手获胜时，我不由自主地喊出皮塔的名字，我用手捂住嘴。如果说开始我对皮塔显得无情无义，那么此时的镜头对此进行了弥补。我寻找他，照顾他，使他恢复健康，参加宴会以得到药品，给予他温情的吻。坦率地讲，当我看到野狗以及加图惨死的画面时，仍感到不寒而栗，可此时，我再次感觉到它好像发生在我根本不曾相识的人身上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Peeta and I are whisked to the president's mansion for the Victory Banquet, where we have very little time to eat as Capitol officials and particularly generous sponsors elbow one another out of the way as they try to get their picture with us. Face after beaming face flashes by, becoming increasingly intoxicated as the evening wears on. Occasionally, I catch a glimpse of Haymitch, which is reassuring, or President Snow, which is terrifying, but I keep laughing and thanking people and smiling as my picture is taken.

<div class="line_en">Despite Haymitch's running interference, I'm determined to see Peeta privately. After I toss and turn for a few hours, I slip into the hall. My first thought is to check the roof, but it's empty. Even the city streets far below are deserted after the celebration last night. I go back to bed for a while and then decide to go directly to his room, but when I try to turn the knob, I find my own bedroom door has been locked from the outside. I suspect Haymitch initially, but then there's a more insidious fear that the Capitol may be monitoring and confining me. I've been unable to escape since the Hunger Games began, but this feels different, much more personal. This feels like I've been imprisoned for a crime and I'm awaiting sentencing. I quickly get back in bed and pretend to sleep until Effie Trinket comes to alert me to the start of another "big, big, big day!"</div>

Then he personally adjusts my makeup until I seem to radiate a soft, rosy glow.

We barely have time to say good-bye to Cinna and Portia, although we'll see them in a few months, when we tour the districts for a round of victory ceremonies.

<div class="line_en">When the train makes a brief stop for fuel, we're allowed to go outside for some fresh air. There's no longer any need to guard us. Peeta and I walk down along the track, hand in hand, and I can't find anything to say now that we're alone. He stops to gather a bunch of wildflowers for me.

Effie is accompanying us back and Haymitch, too, of course. We eat an enormous dinner and settle into silence in front of the television to watch a replay of the interview. With the Capitol growing farther away every second, I begin to think of home. Of Prim and my mother. Of Gale. I excuse myself to change out of my dress and into a plain shirt and pants. As I slowly, thoroughly wash the makeup from my face and put my hair in its braid, I begin transforming back into myself. Katniss Everdeen. A girl who lives in the Seam. Hunts in the woods. Trades in the Hob. I stare in the mirror as I try to remember who I am and who I am not. By the time I join the others, the pressure of Peeta's arm around my shoulders feels alien.</div>
