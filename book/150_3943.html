<div class="line_en">Suddenly, walking along a blank long wall they came to a gateway flanked by sentry boxes, and the bearers set down the chairs. Waddington hurried up to Kitty. She had already jumped out. The officer knocked loudly on the door and shouted. A postern was opened and they passed into a courtyard. It was large and square. Huddled against the walls, under the eaves of the overhanging roofs, soldiers wrapped in their blankets were lying in huddled groups. They stopped for a moment while the officer spoke to a man who might have been a sergeant on guard. He turned and said something to Waddington.</div>

<div class="line_en">Still preceded by the men with lanterns they made their way across the yard, up some steps, through a great doorway and then down into another wide court. On one side of this was a long chamber with lights in it; the lights within shining through the rice paper, silhouetted the elaborate pattern of the lattice. The lantern-bearers led them across the yard towards this room and at the door the officer knocked. It was opened immediately and the officer, with a glance at Kitty, stepped back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="还是几个提灯笼的人带路，他们跟在后面穿过了庭院，上了几级台阶，通过另一扇高高的大门，进入了又一个大院儿。院子的一侧是一座长长的厅堂，里面点着灯。昏黄的光线从窗纸透射出来，使雕镂华丽的窗格更为醒目。提灯笼的人把他们一直带到了这座厅堂之前，然后军官敲了敲厅堂的门。门立即开了，军官回头看了凯蒂一眼，然后让到了一边。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你进去吧。”韦丁顿说道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was a long, low room and the smoky lamps that lit it made the gloom ominous. Three or four orderlies stood about. On a pallet against the wall opposite the door a man was lying huddled under a blanket. An officer was standing motionless at the foot.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是一间又长又矮的屋子，昏黄的灯光使屋子里显得昏暗阴沉，笼罩着不祥的气氛。三四个士兵散站在屋内。正对门口有一张靠墙的矮床，床上盖着一条毯子，毯子下面蜷缩着一个人。一位军官纹丝不动地站在矮床的边上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Walter, Walter," she gasped, in a low, terrified tone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“瓦尔特，瓦尔特。”她压低声音喘息着说道，声调中充满了惊惧。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was a slight movement in the body, or the shadow of a movement; it was so slight it was like a breath of air which you cannot feel and yet for an instant ruffles the surface of still water.</div>

<div class="line_en">The eyes were opened slowly, as though it were an infinite effort to raise those heavy lids, but he did not look, he stared at the wall a few inches from his face. He spoke; his voice, low and weak, had the hint of a smile in it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="瓦尔特的眼睛慢慢地睁开了，好像是用了很大力气才抬起了那沉重的眼皮。他没有朝凯蒂看，只是盯着离他的脸几寸远的墙壁。他说话了，声音十分微弱，但似乎能听出来他是在微笑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Kitty dared not breathe. He made no further sound, no beginning of a gesture, but his eyes, those dark, cold eyes of his (seeing now what mysteries?) stared at the whitewashed wall. Kitty raised herself to her feet. With haggard gaze she faced the man who stood there.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凯蒂屏住呼吸侧耳倾听，但是他没再发出声音，身体也没动，淡漠的黑色眼睛盯着白刷刷的墙壁（他看到了什么神秘的东西吗？）。凯蒂站了起来，形容枯槁地看向站在床边的那个人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="她再次俯到丈夫的身前。那双吓人的眼睛依然空洞洞地盯着前方。她不知道他到底还能不能看见东西，也不知道他能不能听见她说的话。她把嘴唇凑到他的耳朵边上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Distracted, Kitty gave him a glance. He was a tallish man, but stockily built, and he seemed ill at ease in his khaki uniform. He was looking at Walter and she saw that his eyes were wet with tears. It gave her a pang. Why should that man with his yellow, flat face have tears in his eyes? It exasperated her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凯蒂心神纷乱地看了余团长一眼。他身材高大，虎背熊腰，穿的卡其布军装显得极不合身，他的眼睛正看着瓦尔特。她发现他的眼里含着泪水，不禁心里一惊。这个黄脸平额的男人凭什么流泪？她被激怒了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="有个人走了上来，好像是军医或者护理员，做了个手势叫她让开一下。他俯到这个奄奄一息的人旁边，用一条肮脏的湿毛巾沾了沾他的嘴唇。凯蒂站起来，绝望地看向了韦丁顿。“">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She thought that there must be some drug they could give him which would stay the dreadful ebbing of his life. Now that her eyes were more accustomed to the dimness, she saw with horror that his face had fallen. She would hardly have recognized him. It was unthinkable that in a few short hours he should look like another man; he hardly looked like a man at all; he looked like death.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她觉得一定还有什么药可以给他用上，留住他渐渐消失的生命。现在她的眼睛逐渐习惯了昏暗的光线，她惊恐地发现他的脸已经全都干瘪下去了，几乎认不出来是他。短短的几个钟头里，他变得就像完全换了一个人，这太不可思议了。他现在根本不像人，他几乎就是死亡本身。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She thought that he was making an effort to speak. She put her ear close. "Don't fuss. I've had a rough passage, but I'm all right now."</div>

<div class="line_en">Now that the incredible had overwhelmed her consciousness, like a drug coursing through her veins, and she realized that Walter was going to die she had but one thought, and that was to make his end easier for him by dragging from his soul the rancour which poisoned it. If he could die at peace with her it seemed to her that he would die at peace with himself. She thought now not of herself at all but only of him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凯蒂的意识依然处于狂乱之中，难以相信眼前的一切，好像这只是毒品流淌在她的血管里使她出现的幻觉。然后她意识到瓦尔特就要死了，她只有一个想法，那就是消除他心里郁积的怨恨，让他安安静静地死去。如果他原谅了她，那么就是原谅了他自己，也就可以心平气和地瞑目了。她全然没有为她自己考虑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Walter, I beseech you to forgive me," she said, leaning over him. For fear that he could not bear the pressure she took care not to touch him. "I'm so desperately sorry for the wrong I did you. I so bitterly regret it."</div>

<div class="line_en">A shadow passed over his wan and sunken face. It was less than a movement, and yet it gave all the effect of a terrifying convulsion. She had never used that word to him before. Perhaps in his dying brain there passed the thought, confused and difficultly grasped, that he had only heard her use it, a commonplace of her vocabulary, to dogs and babies and motor-cars. Then something horrible occurred. She clenched her hands, trying with all her might to control herself, for she saw two tears run slowly down his wasted cheeks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他暗淡干瘪的脸上微微动了一下，几乎察觉不到，但是仍然叫她惊恐得一阵痉挛。她以前从来没有这么称呼过他。或许是他行将消亡的错乱的意识，误以为她曾经这么叫过他，误以为那只是她的口头语之一，小狗、小孩儿、小汽车，她都这么叫。然后可怕的事情发生了。她把双手攥在一起，竭尽全力控制住自己的神经，因为这时她看到两滴眼泪从他干枯的脸颊上流了下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, my precious, my dear, if you ever loved me -- I know you loved me and I was hateful -- I beg you to forgive me. I've no chance now to show my repentance. Have mercy on me. I beseech you to forgive."</div>

<div class="line_en">She stopped. She looked at him, all breathless, waiting passionately for a reply. She saw that he tried to speak. Her heart gave a great bound. It seemed to her that it would be in a manner a reparation for the suffering she had caused him if at this last moment she could effect his deliverance from that load of bitterness. His lips moved. He did not look at her. His eyes stared unseeing at the whitewashed wall. She leaned over him so that she might hear. But he spoke quite clearly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她停住了，屏住呼吸看着他，急切地期待着他的回答。她看到他想要说话，心脏猛地跳动了一下。如果在这最后的时刻能帮他从怨恨中解脱出来，那就将是她给他带来的痛苦的一个补偿。他的嘴唇动了，他没有看她，眼睛依然无神地盯着粉刷过的白墙。她凑到他的身上，想要听清他的话。他说得十分清晰。">查看中文翻译</div>
