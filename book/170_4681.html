<div class="line_en">He was not a tall man, Tormund Giantsbane, but the gods had given him a broad chest and massive belly. Mance Rayder had named him Tormund Horn-Blower for the power of his lungs, and was wont to say that Tormund could laugh the snow off mountaintops. In his wroth, his bellows reminded Jon of a mammoth trumpeting.</div>

<div class="line_en">That day Tormund bellowed often and loudly. He roared, he shouted, he slammed his fist against the table so hard that a flagon of water overturned and spilled. A horn of mead was never far from his hand, so the spittle he sprayed when making threats was sweet with honey. He called Jon Snow a craven, a liar, and a turncloak, cursed him for a black-hearted buggering kneeler, a robber, and a carrion crow, accused him of wanting to fuck the free folk up the arse. Twice he flung his drinking horn at Jon's head, though only after he had emptied it. Tormund was not the sort of man to waste good mead. Jon let it all wash over him. He never raised his own voice nor answered threat with threat, but neither did he give more ground than he had come prepared to give.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那一天托蒙德经常大声的怒吼。他咆哮着，怒吼着，他用拳头狠狠地砸着桌子把水壶都弄倒了。他的手边一直放着一角蜜酒，这让他在进行威胁时喷出的唾沫星子都散着一股甜腻味儿。他说琼恩是个懦夫，是个骗子，变化无常的家伙，为他是个黑心的下跪者诅咒他，他还是个强盗，一个吃腐肉的乌鸦，指控他想操自由民的阴道。他把酒杯朝着琼恩的脑袋扔了两回，虽然是在喝完了里面的酒以后。托蒙德并不是那种会浪费好蜜酒的家伙。琼恩并没有躲闪，他从没有将他的声调提高半分或者用威胁来回应雷蒙德，但是他也并没有给出比先前打算更多的余地。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jon clasped the offered hand. The words of his oath rang through his head. I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. I am the fire that burns against the cold, the light that brings the dawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the realms of men. And for him a new refrain: I am the guard who opened the gates and let the foe march through. He would have given much and more to know that he was doing the right thing. But he had gone too far to turn back. "Done and done," he said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="琼恩握紧了那只戳出来的手。他立下的誓言在他脑中闪过。我是黑暗中的利刃。我是守夜人的汉子，我是抵御寒冷的火焰，是带来黎明的那道光芒，是唤醒沉睡者的号角，是保卫王国人民的盾牌。对他而言得再加上一条：我还是那个打开大门让敌人列队通过的守卫。他需要付出更多来确信他做的事是正确的。但是他已经走得太远了，无法回头了。“就这么办。”他说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tormund's grip was bone-crushing. That much had not changed about him. The beard was the same as well, though the face under that thicket of white hair had thinned considerably, and there were deep lines graven in those ruddy cheeks. "Mance should have killed you when he had the chance," he said as he did his best to turn Jon's hand to pulp and bone. "Gold for gruel, and boys… a cruel price. Whatever happened to that sweet lad I knew?"</div>

"When all my folk are safe behind your Wall, we'll share a bit o' meat and mead. Till then…" The wildling pulled off the band from his left arm and tossed it at Jon, then did the same with its twin upon his right. "Your first payment. Had those from my father and him from his.

Perhaps you ought to keep them."</div>

"Dormund was cut down in the battle for the Wall, and him still half a boy. One o' your king's knights did for him, some bastard all in grey steel with moths upon his shield. I saw the cut, but my boy was dead before I reached him. And Torwynd… it was the cold claimed him. Always sickly, that one. He just up and died one night. The worst o' it, before we ever knew he'd died he rose pale with them blue eyes. Had to see to him m'self. That was hard, Jon." Tears shone in his eyes. "He wasn't much of a man, truth be told, but he'd been me little boy once, and I loved him."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“噢，我变了。”嘴角的笑意像夏天里的雪一样快速地消逝了。“我不再是那个你在红厅见到的家伙了。我看到了太多的死亡，还有一些更糟的东西。我的儿子们…”悲痛扭曲了托蒙德的脸庞。“多蒙德在长城那场战斗里被砍倒了，他还只是个半大的孩子。你那国王手下的某个骑士下的手，一个全身穿着灰钢盔甲手里拿着蛀虫盾牌的混蛋。我看见砍下去的那一刀，但是我的儿子在我赶到之前就死了。而托温德…是被伤风害死的。他老是病怏怏的。他刚好了一些却一夜之间就死了。最糟糕的是，在我们知道他快死了之前他的蓝眼睛逐渐的灰暗了下去。我不得不亲眼的看着他。那太难了，琼恩。”他的眼里闪着泪花，“他算不上是个男人，说实话，但是他曾经是我的小男孩，我爱他。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“不。我不会让别人说雷拳托蒙德逼着自由民放弃自己的财宝却留着他自己的。”他咧着嘴说。“不过我会留着我老二上的那个环。那可比这些小东西大多了。给你用当项圈都够了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Outside the day was bright and cloudless. The sun had returned to the sky after a fortnight's absence, and to the south the Wall rose blue-white and glittering. There was a saying Jon had heard from the older men at Castle Black: the Wall has more moods than Mad King Aerys, they'd say, or sometimes, the Wall has more moods than a woman. On cloudy days it looked to be white rock. On moonless nights it was as black as coal. In snowstorms it seemed carved of snow. But on days like this, there was no mistaking it for anything but ice. On days like this the Wall shimmered bright as a septon's crystal, every crack and crevasse limned by sunlight, as frozen rainbows danced and died behind translucent ripples. On days like this the Wall was beautiful.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="帐篷外面的天晴朗无云。太阳在消失了两周之后重新回来了，并且把长城的南面照得散发出淡蓝的闪光。琼恩在黑城堡的时候曾经听那边的老人说长城比疯王更有情绪，他们有时候又说长城比女人更有情绪。在阴天它看起来像块白色的石头。在无月的夜晚它又像海边的礁石一样黑。在暴风雪中他又像是雪雕，但是在像今天这样的日子里你就绝不会把它错认成冰以外的任何东西。在像这样的日子里长城会散发出像septon水晶的光芒。每一道裂缝和破口都被阳光够勾画了出来，像冻结了的彩虹在舞蹈并且死在了清澈的微波之后。在像这样的日子里长城是美丽的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Tormund's eldest son stood near the horses, talking with Leathers. Tall Toregg, he was called amongst the free folk. Though he barely had an inch on Leathers, he overtopped his father by a foot. Hareth, the strapping Mole's Town boy called Horse, huddled near the fire, his back to the other two. He and Leathers were the only men Jon had brought with him to the parley; any more might have been seen as a sign of fear, and twenty men would have been of no more use than two if Tormund had been intent on blood. Ghost was the only protection Jon needed; the direwolf could sniff out foes, even those who hid their enmity behind smiles.</div>

Val was clad all in white; white woolen breeches tucked into high boots of bleached white leather, white bearskin cloak pinned at the shoulder with a carved weirwood face, white tunic with bone fastenings.
