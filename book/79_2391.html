<div class="line_en">Jack lay on his side facing the wall, eyes open, listening to Wendy's slow and regular breathing.

Wendy had been downstairs with Danny, sitting in front of the lobby fireplace and reading.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I wanted to poke him a little," Jack said. "When I came up here to be interviewed, he had to drag out all my dirty laundry. Drinking problem. Lost your last job for racking over a student. Wonder if you're the right man for this. Et cetera. The thing that bugged me was that he was bringing all this up because he loved the goddamn hotel so much. The beautiful Overlook. The traditional Overlook. The bloody sacred Overlook. Well, I found a scrapbook in the basement. Somebody had put together all the less savory aspects of Ullman's cathedral, and it looked to me like a little black mass had been going on after hours."</div>

For me it's thirty or forty, because I expect to be associated with the Overlook for a long time.

<div class="line_en">"Before you hit that Hatfield kid," Al was saying, "I had talked the Board out of letting you go and even had them swung around to considering tenure. You blew that one for yourself. I got you this hotel thing, a nice quiet place for you to get yourself together, finish your play, and wait it out until Harry Effinger and I could convince the rest of those guys that they made a big mistake. Now it looks like you want to chew my arm off on your way to a bigger killing. Is that the way you say thanks to your friends, Jack?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“在你揍哈特菲尔德那小子之前，”阿尔说，“我已经说服董事会不要解雇你，甚至已经让他们转而考虑你的转正问题。你自己把那份工作搞丢了，我又为你争取到守护饭店的工作。那是个很好很安静的地方，你可以在那里调整一下心情，完成你的剧本，等我和哈里·埃芬格尔使另外的董事会成员相信他们犯了一个错误。现在看来你想在杀死我之前先斩掉我的左膀右臂，这就是你感谢朋友的方式吗，杰克？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I remember it," he muttered, but the coals of resentment had begun to glow around his heart. First Ullman, then Wendy, now Al. What was this? National Let's Pick Jack Torrance Apart Week? He clamped his lips more tightly together, reached for his cigarettes, and knocked them off onto the floor. Had he ever liked this cheap prick talking to him from his mahogany-lined den in Vermont? Had he really?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“记得，”他咕哝道，但他心中的愤懑之火已经燃烧起来了。开始是厄尔曼，然后是温迪，现在阿尔又来了。这是干什么？全民共戮杰克·托兰斯吗？他紧紧地抿着嘴唇，伸手去取烟盒，却把烟盒碰到了地板上。他喜欢过这个混蛋吗？这个呆在自己舒适的家里跟他谈话的混蛋？他真的喜欢过吗？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He didn't dare say more. His head was throbbing with the hot, acid-etched words that wanted to get out. He tried desperately to think of Danny and Wendy, depending on him, Danny and Wendy sitting peacefully downstairs in front of the fire and working on the first of the second-grade reading primers, thinking everything was A-OK.

<div class="line_cn" title="他不敢再说什么，可是，突突直跳的脑子里却充满了火辣辣的尖酸刻薄的词儿。他极力想着丹尼和温迪，他们都依靠他，他们正安详地坐在楼下的火炉前读一本二年级的阅读课本，他们以为万事大吉。如果他丢了这份工作，那又将如何？像遇上天灾的俄亥俄农民那样拖家带口开着那辆快要散架的大众汽车离开这里到加利福尼亚去？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Wendy Torrance lay on her back, eyes closed, listening to the sound of her husband's slumber -- the long inhale, the brief hold, the slightly guttural exhale. Where did he go when he slept, she wondered. To some amusement park, a Great Barrington of dreams where all the rides were free and there was no wife-mother along to tell them they'd had enough hotdogs or that they'd better be going if they wanted to get home by dark? Or was it some fathoms-deep bar where the drinking never stopped and the batwings were always propped open and all the old companions were gathered around the electronic hockey game, glasses in hand, Al Shockley prominent among them with his tie loosened and the top button of his shirt undone? A place where both she and Danny were excluded and the boogie went on endlessly?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="温迪·托兰斯躺在床上，闭着眼，听着丈夫的鼻息声——长长的吸气，稍稍停顿，略带喉音的呼气。她想知道睡梦中他去了什么地方：是不是某个游乐园，比如大巴灵顿梦之园，身边没有婆婆妈妈的妻子告诉他们热狗已经吃得够多了或想在天黑前赶回家最好马上就动身？或者是去了某个深不可测的酒吧，客人们在饮酒作乐，蝙蝠门总是敞着，老酒友们都聚在一起玩（看？）电子曲棍球游戏，手中端着酒杯，阿尔·肖克利是他们中最出风头的一个，领带松松垮垮的，衬衫第一颗钮扣解开了？一个她和丹尼都不能进去的、低回的爵士乐响个不停的地方？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The most frightening thing, vaporous and unmentioned, perhaps unmentionable, was that all of Jack's drinking symptoms had come back, one by one… all but the drink itself. The constant wiping of the lips with hand or handkerchief, as if to rid them of excess moisture. Long pauses at the typewriter, more balls of paper in the wastebasket. There had been a bottle of Excedrin on the telephone table tonight after Al had called him, but no water glass. He had been chewing them again. He got irritated over little things. He would unconsciously start snapping his fingers in a nervous rhythm when things got too quiet. Increased profanity. She had begun to worry about his temper, too. It would almost come as a relief if he would lose it, blow off steam, in much the same way that he went down to the basement first thing in the morning and last thing at night to dump the press on the boiler. It would almost be good to see him curse and kick a chair across the room or slam a door. But those things, always an integral part of his temperament, had almost wholly ceased. Yet she had the feeling that Jack was more and more often angry with her or Danny, but was refusing to let it out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最可怕的事情——若有若无，未被提及，也许不能提及的——莫过于杰克酗酒后的症状全都死灰复燃了，一个接一个地…除了酒本身。用手或手帕不住地揩嘴唇，好像是要擦去多余的泡沫。他长时间地呆坐在打字机前，废纸篓里的纸团也增多了。今天晚上阿尔来电话后，电话机桌上有一瓶镇痛药，但没有水杯，他嚼那种药片的习惯又恢复了。他开始为鸡毛蒜皮的小事发火。周围太安静的时候，他就下意识地打响指，显得十分焦躁，脏话也增多了。她开始对他的脾气担心起来，如果他发发脾气，也许会更让人放心些，让高压蒸汽排出去，就像他每天早上做的第一件事和每天晚上做的最后一件事那样——到地下室为锅炉降压。她宁愿听他诅咒，看他把椅子踢飞或砰砰地关门。这些做法一直是他脾性中不可分的一部分，可现在几乎看不见了。她有一种感觉，即杰克对她和丹尼的怒气越来越大，但却闷在心里拒绝释放出来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The boiler had a pressure gauge: old, cracked, clotted with grease, but still workable. Jack had none. She had never been able to read him very well. Danny could, but Danny wasn't talking.</div>

<div class="line_en">And the call from Al. At about the same time it had come, Danny had lost all interest in the story they had been reading. He left her to sit by the fire and crossed to the main desk where Jack had constructed a roadway for his matchbox cars and trucks. The Violent Violet Volkswagen was there and Danny had begun to push it rapidly back and forth. Pretending to read her own book but actually looking at Danny over the top of it, she had seen an odd amalgam of the ways she and Jack expressed anxiety. The wiping of the lips. Running both hands nervously through his hair, as she had done while waiting for Jack to come home from his round of the bars. She couldn't believe Al had called just to "ask how things were going." If you wanted to shoot the bull, you called Al. When Al called you, that was business.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对了，阿尔打来了电话。当时丹尼对正在阅读的故事完全失去了兴趣。他让她坐在炉边，自己走到那张大桌子旁边，杰克在桌子上为他的火柴盒和玩具卡车搭了一条马路。他那辆大众模型车也在桌子上，丹尼急速地把它推来推去。她假装看着书，实际上却从书上方观察着丹尼。丹尼表现焦虑的方式是她和杰克表达焦虑的方式的奇怪混合，抹嘴唇，两手神经质地梳理头发——她等杰克从酒吧回家时就是这么做的。她不相信阿尔打电话只是“问问我们的情况怎么样”。如果是你想闲聊，你给阿尔去电话；阿尔给你来电话就真有要紧事了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Later, when she had come back downstairs, she had found Danny curled up by the fire again, reading the second-grade-primer adventures of Joe and Rachel at the circus with their daddy in complete, absorbed attention. The fidgety distraction had completely disappeared. Watching him, she had been struck again by the eerie certainty that Danny knew more and understood more than there was room for in Dr. ("Just call me Bill") Edmonds's philosophy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="后来，回到楼下时，她发现丹尼又蜷曲在火炉边的椅子里，读着那本二年级初级读物：乔和拉切尔在马戏团的冒险经历——在他们父亲的严密保护下。他的焦躁不安已经完全消失了。看着他，温迪又一次十分肯定地感到：丹尼比埃德蒙兹大夫（“就叫我比尔吧”）料想的知道得多，懂得的多。">查看中文翻译</div>

His books were in the bookcase, his coloring books on the desk. A place for everything and everything in its place. Mommy said. Then you know where it is when you want it. But now things had been misplaced. Things were missing. Worse still, things had been added, things you couldn't quite see, like in one of those pictures that said CAN YOU SEE THE INDIANS? And if you strained and squinted, you could see some of them -- the thing you had taken for a cactus at first glance was really a brave with a knife clamped in his teeth, and there were others hiding in the rocks, and you could even see one of their evil, merciless faces peering through the spokes of a covered wagon wheel.

At first they hadn't been so bad, but little by little… his daddy thought about drinking a lot more. Sometimes he was angry at Mommy and didn't know why. He went around wiping his lips with his handkerchief and his eyes were far away and cloudy. Mommy was worried about him and Danny, too. He didn't have to shine into her to know that; it had been in the anxious way she had questioned him on the day the fire hose had seemed to turn into a snake.

<div class="line_en">Once, at nursery school, his friend Scott had pointed out a boy named Robin Stenger, who was moping around the swings with a face almost long enough to step on. Robin's father taught arithmetic at Daddy's school, and Scott's daddy taught history there. Most of the kids at the nursery school were associated either with Stovington Prep or with the small IBM plant just outside of town. The prep kids chummed in one group, the IBM kids in another. There were cross-friendships, of course, but it was natural enough for the kids whose fathers knew each other to more or less stick together. When there was an adult scandal in one group, it almost always filtered down to the children in some wildly mutated form or other, but it rarely jumped to the other group.</div>

<div class="line_en">It wasn't LOSING YOUR MARBLES, Daddy said, it was HAVING A BREAKDOWN, and Mr. Stenger wasn't in a BUGHOUSE but in a SANNY-TARIUM. But despite Daddy's careful explanations, Danny was scared. There didn't seem to be any difference at all between LOSING YOUR MARBLES and HAVING A BREAKDOWN, and whether you called it a BUGHOUSE or a SANNY-TARIUM, there were still bars on the windows and they wouldn't let you out if you wanted to go. And his father, quite innocently, had confirmed another of Scotty's phrases unchanged, one that filled Danny with a vague and unformed dread. In the place where Mr. Stenger now lived, there were THE MEN IN THE WHITE COATS. They came to get you in a truck with no windows, a truck that was gravestone gray. It rolled up to the curb in front of your house and THE MEN IN THE WHITE COATS got out and took you away from your family and made you live in a room with soft walls. And if you wanted to write home, you had to do it with Crayolas.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这不叫“丢玻璃弹子”，爸爸对他说，这叫“精神崩溃”；斯登格也不在“疯人院”，而在“康复院”。但是，尽管有爸爸的悉心解释，丹尼还是很害怕。看来“失去玻璃弹子”和“精神崩溃”之间没有什么差别，而且，不管你称之为“疯人院”还是“康复院”，窗子上都装有铁条。另外，如果想出去，他们是不会同意的。他父亲无意之中证实了斯科特的另一个术语，这个术语让丹尼心里充满了难以名状的恐惧。斯登格先生现在住的地方有“穿白大褂的”。他们把你弄到一辆没有车窗的卡车里，车的颜色是灰蓝色的，跟墓碑的颜色一样。卡车直接开到你家门前的街上，“穿白大褂的”从车里钻出来把你带走，让你住在一间墙壁都是软软的房间里，连想给家里人写信也只能用蜡笔。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">That had been over a year ago, after Daddy stopped taking the Bad Stuff but before he had lost his job. Danny still thought about it often. Sometimes when he fell down or bumped his head or had a bellyache, he would begin to cry and the memory would flash over him, accompanied by the fear that he would not be able to stop crying, that he would just go on and on, weeping and wailing, until his daddy went to the phone, dialed it, and said: "Hello? This is Jack Torrance at 149 Mapleline Way. My son here can't stop crying. Please send THE MEN IN THE WHITE COATS t0 take him to the SANNY-TARIUM. That's right, he's LOST HIS MARBLES. Thank you." And the gray truck with no windows would come rolling up to his door, they would load him in, still weeping hysterically, and take him away.</div>

<div class="line_en">Still he might have told them except he was sure, sooner or later, that they would want to take him away from the hotel. And he wanted desperately to get away from the Overlook. But he also knew that this was his daddy's last chance, that he was here at the Overlook to do more than take care of the place. He was here to work on his papers. To get over losing his job. To love Mommy/Wendy. And until very recently, it had seemed that all those things were happening. It was only lately that Daddy had begun to have trouble. Since he found those papers.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was this fear that had kept him silent. A year older, he was quite sure that his daddy and mommy wouldn't let him be taken away for thinking a fire hose was a snake, his rational mind was sure of that, but still, when he thought of telling them, that old memory rose up like a stone filling his mouth and blocking words. It wasn't like Tony; Tony had always seemed perfectly natural (until the bad dreams, of course), and his parents had also seemed to accept Tony as a more or less natural phenomenon. Things like Tony came from being BRIGHT, which they both assumed he was (the same way they assumed they were BRIGHT), but a fire hose that turned into a snake, or seeing blood and brains on the wall of the Presidential Sweet when no one else could, those things would not be natural. They had already taken him to see a regular doctor. Was it not reasonable to assume that THE MEN IN THE WHITE COATS might come next?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="正是这种担心使他保持着沉默。一年之后的今天，他相信自己的父母不会因为他把消防水管误认为蛇而让人把他带走，他理智上对此十分肯定。但是，每次想到把那件事告诉他们时，过去的记忆就会像一块石头那样冒出来堵住他的嘴巴，把他的话挡回去。这跟托尼不一样，托尼一直显得十分自然（当然指给他带来恶梦之前），而且他父母似乎也或多或少把托尼当作一种自然现象。有托尼这样的事是因为他聪明，他俩都是这样认为的（同样，他们认为他们自己也很聪明），但一条变成蛇的消防软管，或看见了别的任何人都看不见的总统套间墙壁上的血污和脑髓都是不正常的。他们已经把他带去看了一次普通医生，接下来去看的可能就会是“穿白大褂的”，难道这不是十分合情合理的吗？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">What did that mean? He had prayed to God, but God hadn't told him. And what would Daddy do if he stopped working here? He had tried to find out from Daddy's mind, and had become more and more convinced that Daddy didn't know. The strongest proof had come earlier this evening when Uncle Al had called his daddy up on the phone and said mean things and Daddy didn't dare say anything back because Uncle Al could fire him from this job just the way that Mr. Crommert, the Stovington headmaster, and the Board of Directors had fired him from his schoolteaching job.
