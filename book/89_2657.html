<div class="line_en">"We have to pray that Britt-Marie finds a man who can support her, otherwise she'll have to live in the gutter, because she has absolutely no talents of her own," Britt-Marie used to hear her mother say into the telephone. "I got her for my sins," she also used to say, into the telephone if she was drunk, or pointedly at Britt-Marie after tippling sherry.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sweet boys don't get to kiss pretty girls," Britt-Marie's mother sometimes used to say. Even though what she really meant was that pretty girls should not kiss sweet boys, because when dealing with sweet boys there's absolutely no certainty of being able to look forward to a reliable income.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“善良的男孩不会主动亲吻漂亮的女孩。”布里特—玛丽的母亲有时会这样说，但她真正的意思是：“漂亮的女孩不应该亲吻善良的男孩。”因为善良的男孩往往不具备可靠的赚钱能力。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It's impossible to be good enough for a parent after losing a sister who, in all important respects, was a better version of yourself. Britt-Marie did try, nonetheless. But with a father who came home later and later and, in the end, not at all, she did not have very many options. Instead, Britt-Marie learned not to have any expectations of her own, and to put up with her mother's skepticism about her prospects.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在两个孩子里失去了各方面都相对更好的那一个，恐怕很少有父母不会对此耿耿于怀。虽然布里特—玛丽尝试过改变现状，可她的父亲回家越来越晚，最后干脆不回家，她又能有多少改变和选择的机会？她反而学会了对自己不抱期望，忍受母亲对她前途的怀疑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Alf and Kent lived on the same floor, and they fought, as brothers tend to do. Sooner or later they both wanted the same girl. Whether they wanted Britt-Marie because they really did want her, or because brothers always want what their brother wants, she was never quite sure. If Ingrid had been there they would have courted her instead, Britt-Marie had no illusions about that. You tend not to if you're used to living in someone's shadow. But the boys were persistent, competed, fought for her attention in very different ways.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿尔夫和肯特家与布里特—玛丽家住在同一层楼。像大多数兄弟一样，他们时常打架，后来又都想要同一个姑娘，但布里特—玛丽一直不太确定这是为什么，是因为他们真的都喜欢她，还是因为兄弟间的跟风较劲。布里特—玛丽毫不怀疑，如果英格丽德还活着，他们可能早就追她姐姐了。如果你习惯了活在别人的阴影里，很难不这样想，但兄弟俩很固执，一直以不同的方式竞争，想要引起她的注意。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Britt-Marie turned up in an old dress and with sweaty hands and her heart clattering like horse's hooves on cobblestones. Obviously she had heard the stories of how soldiers have a girl in every town, she had just never thought this would be true of Alf. At least she'd never thought he'd have two girls in the same town.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布里特—玛丽最后穿着旧衣服去了火车站，手心直冒汗，心脏像踏在鹅卵石上的马蹄子那样咚咚跳着。她也听说了士兵们每到一个地方就会拈花惹草的传闻，但一直不相信阿尔夫也会这样做，至少不相信他会在同一个地方勾引两个姑娘。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I see you're trying to make yourself look cheap. Well, mission accomplished." Britt-Marie tried to explain that this was modern. Her mother told her not to raise her voice, it made her sound very ordinary. Britt-Marie tried to gently explain that she wanted to surprise Alf at the train station, and her mother snorted: "Oh, he'll be surprised all right." She was right.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我觉得你是想让自己看上去像个廉价货。无论如何，你的目的达到了。”布里特—玛丽想说这是现代风格，她母亲却让她小点声，因为这样显得没有教养。布里特—玛丽轻声解释说，她想在火车站给阿尔夫一个惊喜，她母亲嗤笑道：“嗯，看到你他就很惊喜了。”母亲说得没错。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She'd been sitting all night in the kitchen weeping into a towel when her mother finally got out of bed and scolded her for making too much noise. Britt-Marie told her about the other girl she'd seen Alf with. "Ha, what did you expect when you picked a man like that?" hissed her mother before going back to bed. She got up later than usual the following day. In the end she didn't get up at all. Britt-Marie found a job as a waitress instead of getting herself an education, so she could take care of things at home. Brought dinner into the bedroom for her mother, who had stopped talking, yet was capable now and then of sitting up in the bed and saying, "Ha, working as a waitress -- it must be nice for you not to feel you owe more to your parents after all the advantages we've given you. I don't suppose any education was good enough for you, you obviously prefer to stay here at home and live off my savings instead."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她坐在厨房里，拿毛巾捂着脸哭了一宿。母亲终于起床之后，责备她弄出的噪音太大。布里特—玛丽说，她看见阿尔夫和另外一个女孩在一起。“哈，选了这种男人，你早就应该做好心理准备。”回到床上之前，她母亲如此讥讽道。第二天，母亲起得比平时还晚，最后干脆不起来了。为了照顾家庭，布里特—玛丽找了一份女服务员的工作，每天把晚餐端到母亲的卧室，她母亲已经不愿和任何人说话，但偶尔会从床上坐起来，说：“哈，当服务员——你还真对得起我们给你创造的优越条件。看来学校你也待不下去了，打算在家啃老啊。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Britt-Marie had been hoping for so long that she thought this must be a figment of her imagination, and when he smiled at her it felt like sunlight on her skin. She made his dreams her own. His life became her life. She was good at this, and people want to do the things they're good at. People want someone to know they are there.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="等待太久的布里特—玛丽觉得这一定是她的幻想。肯特对她微笑的时候，就像阳光照在脸上，从那一刻开始，她就把他的梦当成了自己的梦，把他的人生视作她自己的人生。她擅长这个，人总喜欢做自己擅长的事，人总希望某些人知道他就在那儿。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It doesn't feel natural to have to invite him in. It never did, not even when they were teenagers. At her mother's she wasn't allowed to bring boys into the bedroom, so the first time Britt-Marie brought a boy in there, it was Kent. After her mother's death. That boy stayed. Made her home his own and his life hers. So now it seems very natural to them both to be driving around Borg in their BMW, because in many ways they were always at their best when they were in the car. He in the driver's seat, she the passenger. At this moment they can pretend they have only been passing through, and leave Borg, as you do with places you send postcards from.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="请他进屋似乎不合适，哪怕他们回到小时候也不行，她母亲不许她把男孩领进卧室。肯特是她第一个领进卧室的男孩，而那时她母亲已经去世了。那个男孩留了下来，把她的家变成自己家，把自己的人生变成她的人生。所以，他们现在最应该做的就是钻进肯特的宝马，因为他们只有在车里的时候才最自在——他开车，她坐副驾，假装只是路过这里，离开博格，好像他们不过是半路下车，在这儿寄张明信片而已。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They drive into town and back. Kent keeps his hand on the gearstick, so that Britt-Marie can carefully reach out with the tips of her fingers of the hand that is not injured, and put them on top of his. Just to feel that they are both heading in the same direction. His shirt is creased and has coffee stains over his stomach. Britt-Marie remembers Sami talking about how some children look as if they live in the trees, and Kent does look as if he fell out of a tree in his sleep, hitting every branch on his way down. He smiles apologetically.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们真的开车去了镇上，又开回来。肯特右手一直握着换挡杆，好让布里特—玛丽把左手没受伤的那只手的手指搭在他手上，通过这样做让两人获得一种齐心协力奔赴同一个目的地的感觉。他的衬衣皱巴巴的，肚子那儿还有咖啡渍。布里特—玛丽想起萨米说别人会以为那些穿脏衣服的孩子住在树林里，肯特看上去真的像在树林里住过，而且在树上睡觉时摔了下来，在每一根树枝上碾了一遍才滚到地上。发现她在打量他的衬衣，肯特抱歉地笑了笑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Britt-Marie doesn't answer. She's worrying about what people will think. Will they say he had a wife who left him while he was walking about with a stick and everything? Her ring finger feels cold, and she's infinitely grateful for the bandage, which stops Kent seeing it. She knows he let her down, but she can't get away from the feeling that she also let him down.
