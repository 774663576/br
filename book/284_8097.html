<div class="line_en">The afternoon was even lovelier and busier than the morning had been. Already nearly all the weeds were cleared out of the garden and most of the roses and trees had been pruned or dug about. Dickon had brought a spade of his own and he had taught Mary to use all her tools, so that by this time it was plain that though the lovely wild place was not likely to become a "gardener's garden" it would be a wilderness of growing things before the springtime was over.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="下午甚至比早上更可爱、更繁忙。差不多所有的杂草都已清除出了花园，大多数玫瑰和树周围的土已经松过。迪肯带来了他自己的铁锹，他早先教过玛丽怎么用她所有的工具，于是到目前为止，很明显，这个可爱的野地大约不会成为一个“花匠的式花园”，而会在春天结束之前成为各种东西生长、野趣烂漫之所。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The little fox and the rook were as happy and busy as they were, and the robin and his mate flew backward and forward like tiny streaks of lightning. Sometimes the rook flapped his black wings and soared away over the tree-tops in the park. Each time he came back and perched near Dickon and cawed several times as if he were relating his adventures, and Dickon talked to him just as he had talked to the robin. Once when Dickon was so busy that he did not answer him at first, Soot flew on to his shoulders and gently tweaked his ear with his large beak. When Mary wanted to rest a little Dickon sat down with her under a tree and once he took his pipe out of his pocket and played the soft strange little notes and two squirrels appeared on the wall and looked and listened.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="小狐狸和小乌鸦和他们一样忙碌、一样快乐，知更鸟和它媳妇时而朝前、时而朝后地飞来飞去，像一道道极小的闪电。有时乌鸦扇扇后翅，飞上公共园地的树梢去。每次它回来栖息在迪肯附近，都要哇哇叫几声，仿佛在讲述它的历险，迪肯对它讲话如同和知更鸟一样。一次迪肯太忙，一开始没有回答它，煤灰飞上他的肩膀，用大嘴壳轻轻地拧他的耳朵。玛丽想休息一下，迪肯和她一起在树下坐下来，一次他从口袋里拿出笛子，吹出柔和奇怪的小调，两只松鼠在墙上出现，注释着，听着。">查看中文翻译</div>

She was no more used to considering other people than Colin was and she saw no reason why an ill-tempered boy should interfere with the thing she liked best.

<div class="line_en">Mary remembered what he had asked her the day she had gone to his room. "Do you want anything -- dolls -- toys -- books?" She opened the package wondering if he had sent a doll, and also wondering what she should do with it if he had. But he had not sent one. There were several beautiful books such as Colin had, and two of them were about gardens and were full of pictures. There were two or three games and there was a beautiful little writing-case with a gold monogram on it and a gold pen and inkstand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛丽记起她去他房间那天他问她的。“你想要什么东西吗——布娃娃——玩具——书？”她打开包裹，一边猜想着他是不是寄了个布娃娃，还猜想着要是他真的寄了，她该拿它怎么办。然而他没有寄布娃娃。是几本和美丽的书，和柯林的类似，其中两本是关于花园的，满是图片。有两三套游戏，一个美丽小巧的写字盒子，带着金色的花样单字母。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">If she had been friends with Colin she would have run to show him her presents at once, and they would have looked at the pictures and read some of the gardening books and perhaps tried playing the games, and he would have enjoyed himself so much he would never once have thought he was going to die or have put his hand on his spine to see if there was a lump coming. He had a way of doing that which she could not bear. It gave her an uncomfortable frightened feeling because he always looked so frightened himself He said that if he felt even quite a little lump some day he should know his hunch had begun to grow. Something he had heard Mrs. Medlock whispering to the nurse had given him the idea and he had thought over it in secret until it was quite firmly fixed in his mind. Mrs. Medlock had said his father's back had begun to show its crookedness in that way when he was a child. He had never told any one but Mary that most of his "tantrums" as they called them grew out of his hysterical hidden fear. Mary had been sorry for him when he had told her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="假如她和柯林是朋友的话，她会立刻跑去给他看她的礼物，他们会一起看图画，读读园艺书，也许还会试着玩游戏，他会享受乐趣，一次也不会想起他会死，或者把手放到脊柱上察看有没有包鼓起来。他那么做的时候，态度让她难以忍受。因为他自己显得那么恐惧，给她一种不舒服的恐惧感。他说有一天他发觉哪怕很小的包，他就知道他的背开始变驼了。他听到莫得劳克太太对护士窃窃私语，让他有这个念头，他私下里想来想去，直到这个念头牢牢地钉进了他脑子里。莫得劳克太太说他爸爸是孩子的时候，背就显出那种驼样子了。除了玛丽，他从没告诉任何人，多数时候人们所称的“大发脾气”来自他隐藏的恐惧。他告诉玛丽的时候，玛丽曾经可怜过他。">查看中文翻译</div>
