<div class="line_en">By twelve o'clock the next day, Harry's school trunk was packed with his school things and all his most prized possessions -- the Invisibility Cloak he had inherited from his father, the broomstick he had gotten from Sirius, the enchanted map of Hogwarts he had been given by Fred and George Weasley last year. He had emptied his hiding place under the loose floorboard of all food, double-checked every nook and cranny of his bedroom for forgotten spellbooks or quills, and taken down the chart on the wall counting down the days to September the first, on which he liked to cross off the days remaining until his return to Hogwarts.</div>

<div class="line_en">Uncle Vernon had put on his best suit. To some people, this might have looked like a gesture of welcome, but Harry knew it was because Uncle Vernon wanted to look impressive and intimidating. Dudley, on the other hand, looked somehow diminished. This was not because the diet was at last taking effect, but due to fright. Dudley had emerged from his last encounter with a fully grown wizard with a curly pig's tail poking out of the seat of his trousers, and Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon had had to pay for its removal at a private hospital in London. It wasn't altogether surprising, therefore, that Dudley kept running his hand nervously over his backside, and walking sideways from room to room, so as not to present the same target to the enemy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="弗农姨父穿上他最好的西装。在有些人看来，这大概是表示欢迎的意思，但哈利知道，弗农姨父这么做是为了使自己显得风度不凡，盛气凌人。另一方面，达力看上去倒像是缩小了一些。这倒不是因为减肥食谱终于产生了效果，而是因为达力太害怕了。达力上次与一位成年巫师接触时，裤子后面伸出了一根蜷曲的猪尾巴，佩妮姨妈和弗农姨父只好花钱送他进了伦敦的私人医院，把尾巴割掉。达力刚刚从那场惊吓中缓过劲儿来，所以，难怪他现在紧张极了，不停地用手在屁股上摸来摸去，并且躲躲闪闪地从一个房间走到另一个房间，生怕又被敌人当成靶子，重演上次的悲剧。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry felt a slight sense of foreboding. He had rarely seen Mr. or Mrs. Weasley wearing anything that the Dursleys would call "normal." Their children might don Muggle clothing during the holidays, but Mr. and Mrs. Weasley usually wore long robes in varying states of shabbiness. Harry wasn't bothered about what the neighbors would think, but he was anxious about how rude the Dursleys might be to the Weasleys if they turned up looking like their worst idea of wizards.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利微微感到有些恐慌。他很少看到韦斯莱先生或夫人穿着德思礼一家人称之为“正常”的衣服。他们的孩子也许会在过节的时候穿几件麻瓜的衣服，可是韦斯莱先生和夫人通常穿着各种各样破烂的长袍。哈利才不在乎邻居们会怎么想呢，但他担心如果韦斯莱一家出现时的样子正是德思礼夫妇脑海中最可怕的巫师的形象，不知德思礼夫妇将以怎样无礼的态度对待他们。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Lunch was an almost silent meal. Dudley didn't even protest at the food (cottage cheese and grated celery). Aunt Petunia wasn't, eating anything at all. Her arms were folded, her lips were pursed, and she seemed to be chewing her tongue, as though biting back the furious diatribe she longed to throw at Harry.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吃午饭的时候，几乎谁也没有说话。达力甚至没有对食物（农家鲜干酪和芹菜末）提出抗议。佩妮姨妈什么也没吃。她抱着双臂，噘着嘴唇，似乎在咀嚼着自己的舌头，就好像在把她希望扔给哈利的愤怒谴责咀嚼碎了咽下去似的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Er," said Harry.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嗯。”哈利回答。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He hadn't thought of that. How were the Weasleys going to pick him up? They didn't have a car anymore; the old Ford Anglia they had once owned was currently running wild in the Forbidden Forest at Hogwarts. But Mr. Weasley had borrowed a Ministry of Magic car last year; possibly he would do the same today?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他倒没有想过这个问题。韦斯莱一家准备怎么来接他呢？他们已经没有汽车了。他们原来是有一辆福特安格里亚老爷车的，可是那辆车眼下正在霍格沃茨的禁林里狂奔乱撞呢。去年，韦斯莱先生是从魔法部借了一辆汽车，也许他今天也会这么做？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry spent most of the afternoon in his bedroom; he couldn't stand watching Aunt Petunia peer out through the net curtains every few seconds, as though there had been a warning about an escaped rhinoceros. Finally, at a quarter to five, Harry went back downstairs and into the living room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利几乎整个下午都待在自己的卧室里。他无法忍受佩妮姨妈每隔几秒钟就透过网状的窗帘朝外窥视一番的样子，就好像她得到警告，有一只犀牛从动物园里逃了出来似的。最后，到了五点差一刻，哈利才走下楼梯，来到客厅里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Uncle Vernon snorted into his mustache. Normally, Uncle Vernon would have asked what car Mr. Weasley drove; he tended to judge other men by how big and expensive their cars were.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="弗农姨父哼了一声，把粗气喷在胡子上。要按惯常的情况，弗农姨父就该追问韦斯莱先生开的是什么车了。他总喜欢根据别的男人开的车有多宽敞、多昂贵来评价他们。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Aunt Petunia was compulsively straightening cushions. Uncle Vernon was pretending to read the paper, but his tiny eyes were not moving, and Harry was sure he was really listening with all his might for the sound of an approaching car. Dudley was crammed into an armchair, his porky hands beneath him, clamped firmly around his bottom. Harry couldn't take the tension; he left the room and went and sat on the stairs in the hall, his eyes on his watch and his heart pumping fast from excitement and nerves.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="佩妮姨妈正在一个劲儿地把坐垫摆来摆去，就像患了强迫性精神病一样。弗农姨父假装在看报纸，但他的小眼睛一动不动。哈利可以肯定，他实际上在全神贯注地听着是不是有汽车开来。达力把肥胖的身体挤进一张扶手椅里，肉乎乎的双手压在身下，紧紧抓住自己的屁股。哈利受不了这种紧张的气氛，就离开了客厅，出来坐在门厅的楼梯上，眼睛盯着手表，心脏因为兴奋和紧张而跳得飞快。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“哼，想都别想，”弗农姨父说道，哈利听见他站了起来，在客厅里踱来踱去，“他们带上那男孩就走，不许在这里逗留。那是说他们如果来的话。大概把日子搞错了，我敢说他们那类人根本就没有什么时间观念。要么就是他们开的那辆老爷车半路抛锚——啊啊啊啊啊呀！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dudley suddenly reappeared in the room. Harry could hear the clunk of his trunk on the stairs, and knew that the sounds had scared Dudley out of the kitchen. Dudley edged along the wall, gazing at Mr. Weasley with terrified eyes, and attempted to conceal himself behind his mother and father. Unfortunately, Uncle Vernon's bulk, while sufficient to hide bony Aunt Petunia, was nowhere near enough to conceal Dudley.</div>
