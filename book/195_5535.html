<div class="line_en">When Philip returned to Amitrano's he found that Fanny Price was no longer working there. She had given up the key of her locker. He asked Mrs. Otter whether she knew what had become of her; and Mrs. Otter, with a shrug of the shoulders, answered that she had probably gone back to England. Philip was relieved. He was profoundly bored by her ill-temper. Moreover she insisted on advising him about his work, looked upon it as a slight when he did not follow her precepts, and would not understand that he felt himself no longer the duffer he had been at first. Soon he forgot all about her. He was working in oils now and he was full of enthusiasm. He hoped to have something done of sufficient importance to send to the following year's Salon. Lawson was painting a portrait of Miss Chalice. She was very paintable, and all the young men who had fallen victims to her charm had made portraits of her. A natural indolence, joined with a passion for picturesque attitude, made her an excellent sitter; and she had enough technical knowledge to offer useful criticisms. Since her passion for art was chiefly a passion to live the life of artists, she was quite content to neglect her own work. She liked the warmth of the studio, and the opportunity to smoke innumerable cigarettes; and she spoke in a low, pleasant voice of the love of art and the art of love. She made no clear distinction between the two.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was the first time that Philip set about a portrait, and he began with trepidation but also with pride. He sat by Lawson and painted as he saw him paint. He profited by the example and by the advice which both Lawson and Miss Chalice freely gave him. At last Lawson finished and invited Clutton in to criticise. Clutton had only just come back to Paris. From Provence he had drifted down to Spain, eager to see Velasquez at Madrid, and thence he had gone to Toledo. He stayed there three months, and he was returned with a name new to the young men: he had wonderful things to say of a painter called El Greco, who it appeared could only be studied in Toledo.</div>

There seemed to be a mysterious force in him which he himself did not understand, but which was struggling obscurely to find an outlet. His strength impressed you. Lawson dreaded the criticism he asked for and had discounted the blame he thought he might get by affecting a contempt for any opinion of Clutton's; but Philip knew there was nothing which would give him more pleasure than Clutton's praise. Clutton looked at the portrait for some time in silence, then glanced at Philip's picture, which was standing on an easel.</div>

<div class="line_en">Lawson's face fell, and he stared at Clutton with astonishment: he had no notion what he meant, Clutton had no gift of expression in words, and he spoke as though it were an effort. What he had to say was confused, halting, and verbose; but Philip knew the words which served as the text of his rambling discourse. Clutton, who never read, had heard them first from Cronshaw; and though they had made small impression, they had remained in his memory; and lately, emerging on a sudden, had acquired the character of a revelation: a good painter had two chief objects to paint, namely, man and the intention of his soul. The Impressionists had been occupied with other problems, they had painted man admirably, but they had troubled themselves as little as the English portrait painters of the eighteenth century with the intention of his soul.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="劳森的脸一下拉得老长，目瞪口呆地看着克拉顿，搞不明白他葫芦里到底卖的什么药。克拉顿天生不善于表达，说句话要费好大的劲儿。他经常颠三倒四、没完没了地说些不着边的东西，可菲利普能从这堆乱七八糟的话里听出点门道。从来不读书的克拉顿最初是从克朗肖那儿听到这番言论的；尽管当时这番话没有给他留下深刻的印象，却一直弥留在他脑海。最近他忽然从这番话里得到一个新的发现，即一名出色的画家必须能画出两样东西——人和人灵魂的诉求。印象派画家的精力都被其他问题吸引去了，他们画的人像风格独特，深受喜爱，但就像十八世纪的英国画师一样，他们也几乎从不关注画中人物的灵魂诉求。">查看中文翻译</div>

You can't feed yourself on the day before yesterday, it's ground which has been swept dry. You must go back. It's when I saw the Grecos that I felt one could get something more out of portraits than we knew before."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“要是你真能在马奈最拿手的方面胜他一筹那当然好啦，可你离他还差十万八千里呢。你不能总满足于那些老一套的东西，况且印象主义的价值已经被人挖掘到极限了。你得走走回头路才行。其实，一直到我看见埃尔·格列柯的画时，我才意识到原来能从肖像画里领略到这么多之前从来不知道的东西。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你这是步入罗斯金的后尘了！”劳森大喊。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But when you try to get that you become literary," said Lawson, interrupting. "Let me paint the man like Manet, and the intention of his soul can go to the devil."</div>

<div class="line_en">"No -- you see, he went for morality: I don't care a damn for morality: teaching doesn't come in, ethics and all that, but passion and emotion. The greatest portrait painters have painted both, man and the intention of his soul; Rembrandt and El Greco; it's only the second-raters who've only painted man. A lily of the valley would be lovely even if it didn't smell, but it's more lovely because it has perfume. That picture"-- he pointed to Lawson's portrait --"well, the drawing's all right and so's the modelling all right, but just conventional; it ought to be drawn and modelled so that you know the girl's a lousy slut. Correctness is all very well: El Greco made his people eight feet high because he wanted to express something he couldn't get any other way."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不不不，你瞧，罗斯金强调道德，可我才不稀罕什么道德呢。我向来只动情，不说理。最伟大的画家一定是形神兼顾的，比如伦勃朗和埃尔·格列柯。只有二流画家才会单纯地只画个人形。山涧百合即使不香也很招人喜欢，但若能再带点香味，岂不是更可爱？那幅画，”他指了指劳森的肖像画，“嗯，画得很好，也很立体，就是太普通，太寻常了。你的画法和整幅画的设计本应呈现出一个遭人唾骂的放荡女人的形象。准确性固然重要，但埃尔·格列柯曾经把人画得有十八英尺那么高，因为只有通过这种夸张的方式才能表现出他的心中所想。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">About this time Philip made a new friend. On Monday morning models assembled at the school in order that one might be chosen for the week, and one day a young man was taken who was plainly not a model by profession. Philip's attention was attracted by the manner in which he held himself: when he got on to the stand he stood firmly on both feet, square, with clenched hands, and with his head defiantly thrown forward; the attitude emphasised his fine figure; there was no fat on him, and his muscles stood out as though they were of iron. His head, close-cropped, was well-shaped, and he wore a short beard; he had large, dark eyes and heavy eyebrows. He held the pose hour after hour without appearance of fatigue. There was in his mien a mixture of shame and of determination. His air of passionate energy excited Philip's romantic imagination, and when, the sitting ended, he saw him in his clothes, it seemed to him that he wore them as though he were a king in rags. He was uncommunicative, but in a day or two Mrs. Otter told Philip that the model was a Spaniard and that he had never sat before.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="差不多正是这个时候，菲利普结识了一位新朋友。礼拜一早上学校的所有模特都要集合，选出一个做本周的模特。有一次大家挑中了一个年轻男人。他一看就不是专业做模特出身的。菲利普被他身上那股气质神态吸引住了。他走上台笔挺地站稳，双手握拳，头骄傲地向前伸着，这个姿态最能衬托出他健美的体形。他的身上没有一丝多余的赘肉，肌肉线条像钢铁雕刻的那样利落分明。头发剃得极短，头的形状非常完美，脸上蓄着短胡子，眼睛大且黑，眉毛浓又粗。一个姿势经常一摆就是好几个钟头，但他好像完全不会乏累。他的神态里有些羞愧，还有些决心下定的坚毅。他的满心激情和勃勃生机也传染了菲利普，让菲利普不由开始浮想联翩。等到工作一结束，菲利普看他穿好衣服，觉得他就像个衣衫褴褛但气度非凡的皇帝。他不喜欢和人打交道。一两天后还是奥特夫人跟菲利普介绍说他是个西班牙人，之前从来没有当过模特。">查看中文翻译</div>

He was growing a little impatient of Lawson's peremptory advice and wanted to be by himself. At the end of the week he went up to the model and on the pretence that his drawing was not finished asked whether he would come and sit to him one day.</div>

<div class="line_en">With a shrug of the shoulders the model consented, and they went off to a cremerie. The Spaniard spoke broken French, fluent but difficult to follow, and Philip managed to get on well enough with him. He found out that he was a writer. He had come to Paris to write novels and kept himself meanwhile by all the expedients possible to a penniless man; he gave lessons, he did any translations he could get hold of, chiefly business documents, and at last had been driven to make money by his fine figure. Sitting was well paid, and what he had earned during the last week was enough to keep him for two more; he told Philip, amazed, that he could live easily on two francs a day; but it filled him with shame that he was obliged to show his body for money, and he looked upon sitting as a degradation which only hunger could excuse. Philip explained that he did not want him to sit for the figure, but only for the head; he wished to do a portrait of him which he might send to the next Salon.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="模特耸了耸肩膀，算是同意了。他们一起去了家小饭馆。这个西班牙人的法语虽然说得很快，但却听得人一头雾水。菲利普使出了吃奶的劲儿才能勉强跟上他的意思。他是作家，专门跑来巴黎写小说。为了混口吃的，所有穷光蛋能干的活儿他都干过；给别人上过课，只要有翻译的活儿也一概来者不拒（大部分都是生意文件），最后竟然沦落到要靠这副好身材挣钱了。做模特待遇很可观，他上个礼拜挣的钱够他撑上至少半个月了。他给一脸惊讶的菲利普说，自己每天只花两法郎就能过得很滋润。但是对于要靠出卖身体挣钱这件事，他心里一直有个过不去的坎儿，觉得抬不起头来。如果不是穷得吃不起饭，他是绝对不会做这种卑贱工作的。菲利普提议说他只想画一个头像，不需要模特摆出全身的姿势来。菲利普想画一幅他的头像拿去明年的展览会报名参展。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There were legends in the Latin quarter of a time when students of different countries lived together intimately, but this was long since passed, and now the various nations were almost as much separated as in an Oriental city. At Julian's and at the Beaux Arts a French student was looked upon with disfavour by his fellow-countrymen when he consorted with foreigners, and it was difficult for an Englishman to know more than quite superficially any native inhabitants of the city in which he dwelt. Indeed, many of the students after living in Paris for five years knew no more French than served them in shops and lived as English a life as though they were working in South Kensington.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="拉丁区里来自各个国家的学生一度相处得非常融洽，这件事也曾经被传为一大奇事。可好景不长，现在住在这里的不同国家的学生已经互相不再走动了，他们之间就像东方国家里人和人之间的关系那样非常疏远。在朱利安画室和博扎美术学校里，一个和外国学生混在一起的法国人总会遭到同胞们的冷眼相待。所以，作为一个英国人想在他居住的城市里结交几个知心好友实在是比登天还难。事实上，好多学生在巴黎住了五年但是学到的法语也就只够他们去商店买东西或者下馆子点餐，他们虽说住在巴黎，可其实就和住在肯辛顿南部没什么两样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="菲利普劝他收下报酬，可他心意已决，坚持要把钱退回。最后他们把时间定为下周一下午一点开始。他给了菲利普一张名片，名字是米盖尔·阿胡利亚。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Miguel sat regularly, and though he refused to accept payment he borrowed fifty francs from Philip every now and then: it was a little more expensive than if Philip had paid for the sittings in the usual way; but gave the Spaniard a satisfactory feeling that he was not earning his living in a degrading manner. His nationality made Philip regard him as a representative of romance, and he asked him about Seville and Granada, Velasquez and Calderon. But Miguel bad no patience with the grandeur of his country. For him, as for so many of his compatriots, France was the only country for a man of intelligence and Paris the centre of the world.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="米盖尔定期来做模特。虽然他拒绝接受任何酬劳，但时不时地要从菲利普这里借走五十法郎——算起来比付报酬还要贵了。但米盖尔心里却很得意，因为他总算是没有通过这种自己所不齿的方式来挣钱。菲利普觉得他是西班牙人，自然应该是个天性浪漫的情种。他问了米盖尔很多塞维利亚和格拉纳达、委拉斯凯兹和卡尔德隆的事儿。米盖尔却对自己国家这些赫赫有名的城市和有头有脸的人物很不耐烦。和他的许多同胞一样，他觉得只有法国才配称得上是智者贤士的国度，巴黎就是整个世界的中心。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">One day he brought part of the manuscript, and in his bad French, translating excitedly as he went along so that Philip could scarcely understand, he read passages. It was lamentable. Philip, puzzled, looked at the picture he was painting: the mind behind that broad brow was trivial; and the flashing, passionate eyes saw nothing in life but the obvious. Philip was not satisfied with his portrait, and at the end of a sitting he nearly always scraped out what he had done. It was all very well to aim at the intention of the soul: who could tell what that was when people seemed a mass of contradictions? He liked Miguel, and it distressed him to realise that his magnificent struggle was futile: he had everything to make a good writer but talent. Philip looked at his own work. How could you tell whether there was anything in it or whether you were wasting your time? It was clear that the will to achieve could not help you and confidence in yourself meant nothing. Philip thought of Fanny Price; she had a vehement belief in her talent; her strength of will was extraordinary.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有次他带了一些手稿来，用蹩脚的法语兴冲冲地翻译给菲利普听。他读了些什么菲利普根本就没怎么听懂，只觉得眼前的男人傻得可怜。菲利普稀里糊涂地看着自己给他画的头像：额头宽阔，下面却是一颗如此平庸的大脑，眼神炯炯，却只能看到生活里最显而易见的表象。菲利普对自己的画不太满意，最后几乎把所有成果都涂改掉了。表达人物的灵魂诉求固然是可取的，但假如模特儿本身就是个矛盾体时，谁又能判断出他的灵魂诉求是什么呢？他挺喜欢米盖尔的，所以当他发现米盖尔的伟大奋斗最后只能竹篮打水一场空时，他的心里也很不好受：想成为一个优秀作家，米盖尔已经“万事俱备，只差天赋”了。菲利普看了看自己的作品。怎么判定一幅画究竟是可圈可点还是纯粹的浪费时间呢？显然，有志者不一定能成事，自信也帮不了你什么大忙。菲利普联想到了范宁·普里斯，她对自己的才华坚信不疑，也有着不达目标誓不罢休的意志。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Little by little, with the exuberant rhetoric of his race, he revealed his ambitions. He was writing a novel which he hoped would make his name. He was under the influence of Zola, and he had set his scene in Paris. He told Philip the story at length. To Philip it seemed crude and stupid; the naive obscenity -- c'est la vie, mon cher, c'est la vie, he cried -- the naive obscenity served only to emphasise the conventionality of the anecdote. He had written for two years, amid incredible hardships, denying himself all the pleasures of life which had attracted him to Paris, fighting with starvation for art's sake, determined that nothing should hinder his great achievement. The effort was heroic.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="米盖尔用他那西班牙人特有的浮夸言辞把自己的理想抱负向菲利普娓娓道来。他正在创作一部小说，并渴望借此一举成名。左拉对他写作的影响很大，他将小说中故事的地点设定在了巴黎。听完他详细的复述，菲利普觉得这故事情节毫无精妙之处，简直愚蠢透顶。故事里一些对情欲的幼稚描写反而只衬托出情节的庸俗老套（他对这样的评价心里很不服气，大声辩解：“这就是生活啊，亲爱的朋友！这就是生活！”）。这个故事他整整写了两年，中间受到了很多超乎想象的阻力。来巴黎前做出的所有美好预想一个都没有实现，虽然天天饿着肚子为艺术而奋斗，但心里却很坚定：没有什么能阻拦他赢得伟大的胜利！这番功夫下得颇有点英雄气概。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He ran down and told the porter that she was certainly in the room. He had had a letter from her and feared a terrible accident. He suggested breaking open the door. The porter, who had been sullen and disinclined to listen, became alarmed; he could not take the responsibility of breaking into the room; they must go for the commissaire de police. They walked together to the bureau, and then they fetched a locksmith. Philip found that Miss Price had not paid the last quarter's rent: on New Year's Day she had not given the concierge the present which old-established custom led him to regard as a right. The four of them went upstairs, and they knocked again at the door. There was no reply. The locksmith set to work, and at last they entered the room. Philip gave a cry and instinctively covered his eyes with his hands. The wretched woman was hanging with a rope round her neck, which she had tied to a hook in the ceiling fixed by some previous tenant to hold up the curtains of the bed. She had moved her own little bed out of the way and had stood on a chair, which had been kicked away. it was lying on its side on the floor. They cut her down. The body was quite cold.</div>
