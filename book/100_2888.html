<div class="line_en">Scott blew air out through his mouth and waited for the groaning and fake retching to subside. A small, pale pink-eyed man with a degree in Business Management from Loughborough, he had once hoped to be a captain of industry. He had pictured himself playing golf at conference centres or striding up the steps of a private jet, and yet just this morning he had scooped a plug of yellow pork fat the size of a human head from the kitchen drains. With his bare hands. He could still feel the grease between his fingers. He was thirty-nine years old, and it wasn't meant to be this way.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯科特呼了口气，等着哼唧抱怨和假装呕吐的怪声渐渐平息。他是个眼珠微红的矮小男子，在拉夫堡大学取得了商业管理学位，一度立志做大企业家。他曾经设想自己在会议中心打高尔夫球，或是健步走上私人飞机的悬梯。而今早他却从厨房的下水道里捞出一块人头大小的黄色猪肥膘，徒手。此刻他仍感到指间油腻腻的。他今年三十有九，境遇本不当如此。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Paddy pressed play on the greasy tape deck behind the bar and the music began, a maddening forty-five minutes loop of synthetic mariachi music, beginning aptly enough with "La Cucaracha", the cockroach, to be heard twelve times in an eight-hour shift. Twelve times a shift, twenty-four shifts a month, for seven months now. Emma looked down at the baseball cap in her hand. The restaurant logo, a cartoon donkey, peered up at her goggle-eyed from beneath his sombrero, drunk it would seem, or insane perhaps. She settled the cap on her head and slid off the bar stool as if lowering herself into icy water. The new guy was waiting for her, beaming, his fingertips jammed awkwardly into the pockets of his gleaming white jeans, and Emma wondered once again what exactly she was doing with her life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="帕迪按下吧台内音响上油腻腻的播放键，音乐声响起。那是一盘让人抓狂的四十五分钟的卡带，收录了墨西哥流浪艺人的曲子，开头的“拉库卡拉查”（《蟑螂》）还听得下去，只不过八小时内要播放十二次。一班八小时，十二轮音乐，每月二十四个班，总共七个月了。爱玛低头看着手里的棒球帽，上面贴着餐厅的标志，一头卡通驴，眼睛藏在墨西哥大帽檐下，盯着她瞪圆的双目瞧，那神色似有醉意，又有点疯癫。她戴上帽子，从吧台凳上滑下来，似乎正踏进冰冷的水里。新来的正笑盈盈地等着她，手指笨拙地插在白色牛仔裤口袋里。爱玛又一次恍惚起来—她在过什么日子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This letter comes to you from a downtown Bombay hostel with scary mattresses and hot and cold running Australians. My guide book tells me that it has character i. e. rodents but my room also has a little plastic picnic table by the window and it's raining like crazy outside, harder even than in Edinburgh. It's CHUCKING IT DOWN, Em, so loud that I can barely hear the compilation tape you made me which I like a lot incidentally except for that jangly indie stuff because after all I'm not some GIRL. I've been trying to read the books you gave me at Easter too, though I have to admit I'm finding Howards End quite heavy-going. It's like they've been drinking the same cup of tea for two hundred pages, and I keep waiting for someone to pull a knife or an alien invasion or something, but that's not going to happen is it? When will you stop trying to educate me, I wonder? Never I hope.</div>

<div class="line_en">By the way, in case you hadn't guessed from the Exquisite Prose and all the SHOUTING I'm writing this drunk, beers at lunch time! As you can tell I'm not a great letter writer not like you (your last letter was so funny) but all I will say is that India is incredible. It turns out that being banned from Teaching English as a Foreign Language was the best thing that ever happened to me (though I still think they overreacted. Morally Unfit? Me? Tove was twenty-one). I won't bore you with all that sunrise over the Hindu-kesh prose except to say that all the clichés are true (poverty, tummy upsets blah blah blah). Not only is it a rich and ancient civilization but you wouldn't BELIEVE what you can get in the chemists without a prescription.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="顺便说一句，写得有点没遮没拦的，你可能猜到了，是午餐啤酒灌多了的原因。而且想必你也看得出，我不太会写东西的，比不得你（你上一封信可太逗了）。不过我想说的是，印度真是太不可思议了！他们居然禁止我以外教身份教英语，这真是我遇上的最妙的事。（不过我还是觉得他们小题大做。道德不够高尚？我？托芙那时已经二十一岁了。）我不会引用那篇写兴都库什山日出的散文来扫你的兴，但想说所有老生常谈都是真的（贫困，饥饿，等等）。这里不仅有丰富的古文明遗迹，更让你没法相信的是，药店里不用处方就能搞到某些东西……">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So I've seen some amazing things and while it's not always fun it is an Experience and I've taken thousands of photographs which I will show you very very slooooooowly when I get back. Pretend to be interested, won't you? After all I pretended to be interested when you banged on about the Poll Tax Riots. Anyway, I showed some of my photos to this TV producer who I met on a train the other day, a woman (not what you think, old, mid-thirties) and she said I could be a professional. She was here producing a sort of young people's TV travel show thing and she gave me her card and told me to call her in August when they're back again, so who knows maybe I'll do some researching or filming even.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所以我见了些不得了的事，虽然并不全都那么有趣，不过算是一种经历，而且还拍了上千张照片，等回去以后慢慢慢慢地给你看。你会给我面子，哪怕做出一副很感兴趣的样子，对吧？无论怎样，你当初对我大谈“人头税骚乱”的时候，我可是很配合的。我给一位电视制作人看了照片，是我在火车上认识的一位女性（别想歪了，她年纪不小，三十多岁了），她说我有专业的资质。她此行目的是拍摄一档青年旅游节目。她给了我名片，要我八月份我们都回国以后打电话给她。所以说谁知道呢，也许我会去做些调研工作，甚至拍部电影呢。">查看中文翻译</div>

I really, really enjoyed your Virginia-Woolf-Emily-whatsername play when I was in London, and like I said I think it showed loads of promise which sounds like bullshit but isn't. I think you're right to give up acting though, not because you're not good but because you so obviously hate it. Candy was nice too, much nicer than you made out. Send her my love. Are you doing another play? Are you still in that box room? Does the flat still smell of fried onions? Is Tilly Killick still soaking her big grey bras in the washing-up bowl? Are you still at Mucho Loco or whatever it's called? Your last letter made me laugh so much, Em, but you should still get out of there because while it's good for gags it's definitely bad for your soul. You can't throw years of your life away because it makes a funny anecdote.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="你的工作如何呢？在制作新戏？我回伦敦后看了你那出弗吉尼亚·伍尔芙和艾米丽什么的戏，真的真的很欣赏。我说过，我原以为你对它打的包票很靠不住，结果是我错了。不过我觉得你放弃表演是对的，不是说你演得不好，而是你对它明显表现得很厌恶。糖糖挺好的，比你形容的好多了。替我向她致意。你又出新戏了吗，还在那家剧团吗？你的公寓还是一股炒洋葱的味道吗？蒂莉·基利克还会把灰色的大文胸泡在水池里吗？你还在那家叫洛克什么的餐厅吗？你上一封信提到它，看得我大笑不止。爱姆，你还是得离开那儿，因为这种经历虽然可以充作谈资笑料，但对你的灵魂却不无损害。不能为了一段有趣的经历而虚掷几年光阴。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Good. Here it is. I think you're scared of being happy, Emma. I think you think that the natural way of things is for your life to be grim and grey and dour and to hate your job, hate where you live, not to have success or money or God forbid a boyfriend (and a quick discersion here -- that whole self-deprecating thing about being unattractive is getting pretty boring I can tell you). In fact I'll go further and say that I think you actually get a kick out of being disappointed and under-achieving, because it's easier, isn't it? Failure and unhappiness is easier because you can make a joke out of it. Is this annoying you? I bet it is. Well I've only just started.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="好，是这样的。我认为你对快乐抱有恐惧，爱玛。我感觉你认为，严酷、灰暗、沉闷才是生活的本色，同样也会去厌恨自己的工作、厌恨身处的地方，没有成就、没有钱，不交男朋友，这些都是理所应当（插一句，我判定，妄自菲薄地认为自己没有魅力会令你意志消沉）。我下面的话可能更尖锐，我觉得你甚至在失落感和挫败感中寻求乐趣，因为这种状态比较省力，对不对？失败和不开心对你而言更容易承受，因为你甚至可以苦中作乐。我说这些没让你恼火吧？我打赌你恼了。不过我才开了个头呢。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Em, I hate thinking of you sitting in that awful flat with the weird smells and noises and the overhead lightbulbs or sat in that launderette, and by the way there's no reason in this day and age why you should be using a launderette, there's nothing cool or political about launderettes it's just depressing. I don't know, Em, you're young, you're practically a genius, and yet your idea of a good time is to treat yourself to a service wash. Well I think you deserve more. You are smart and funny and kind (too kind if you ask me) and by far the cleverest person I know. And (am drinking more beer here -- deep breath) you are also a Very Attractive Woman. And (more beer) yes I do mean "sexy" as well, though I feel a bit sick writing it down. Well I'm not going to scribble it out because it's politically incorrect to call someone "sexy" because it is also TRUE. You're gorgeous, you old hag, and if I could give you just one gift ever for the rest of your life it would be this. Confidence. It would be the gift of Confidence. Either that or a scented candle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱姆，我很不愿去想你坐在那间一股怪味的破公寓里，饱受噪音之苦、头顶没有灯罩的灯泡，或坐在那间洗衣房的样子。顺便提一句，你年纪轻轻的，没有理由在洗衣房里消磨，那里一点也不精彩，更没有什么政治因素，那里只有压抑和沉闷。我不知道怎么说，爱姆，你年轻有才，却把大好光阴用来洗洗涮涮。我是觉得你该得到更多。你机智、风趣、善良（要我说是善良过头了），绝对是我认识的最聪明的人。再有（我又喝了些啤酒，深吸一口气），你是位魅力四射的女性，而且（再来点儿啤酒），对，我的意思当然也有“性感”，尽管写下来觉得有点肉麻。但我不会把它画掉的，因为形容谁“性感”虽然不太庄重，但我是实话实说。你很大气，有女魔头的范儿，如果要送你一样让你一生都受用的礼物，我会选择“自信”。再不然一支芬芳蜡烛也可以。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I know from your letters and from seeing you after your play that you feel a little bit lost right now about what to do with your life, a bit rudderless and oarless and aimless but that's okay that's alright because we're all meant to be like that at twenty-four. In fact our whole generation is like that. I read an article about it, it's because we never fought in a war or watched too much television or something. Anyway, the only people with oars and rudders and aims are dreary bores and squares and careerists like Tilly-bloody-Killick or Callum O'Neill and his refurbished computers. I certainly don't have a master plan I know you think I've got it all sorted out but I haven't I worry too I just don't worry about the dole and housing benefit and the future of the Labour Party and where I'm going to be in twenty years' time and how Mr Mandela is adjusting to freedom.</div>

<div class="line_en">On the wall in front of me is this massive sort of praying mantis thing and he's looking at me as if to say shut up now so I will. It's stopped raining, and I'm about to go to a bar and meet up with some new friends for a drink, three female medical students from Amsterdam which tells you all you need to know. But on the way I'm going to find a post box and send this before I change my mind. Not because I think you coming here is a bad idea -- it isn't, it's a great idea and you must come -- but because I think I might have said too much. Sorry if this has annoyed you. The main thing is that I think about you a lot, that's all. Dex and Em, Em and Dex. Call me sentimental, but there's no-one in the world that I'd like to see get dysentery more than you.</div>

<div class="line_en">He slid his feet back into his sandals, stood a little unsteadily and steeled himself for the communal showers. He was deeply tanned now, his great project of the last two years, the colour penetrating deep into his skin like a creosoted fence. With his head shaved very close to the skull by a street barber, he had also lost some weight but secretly liked the new look: heroically gaunt, as if he'd just been rescued from the jungle. To complete the image he had acquired a cautious tattoo on his ankle, a non-committal yin-and-yang that he would probably regret back in London. But that was fine. In London he would wear socks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他双脚套上凉鞋，晃晃悠悠地起身去了公共浴室。他的皮肤经过两年的刻意日晒已成了棕褐色，犹如刷了杂酚油的栅栏；头发被街头师傅剃成了板寸；体重也减了一些，瘦削中透着英雄气概，像刚从密林中脱险归来。这一新形象他暗自得意，为追求完美，更保守地在脚踝上刺了一枚文身—一张莫名其妙的太极图。恐怕一回到伦敦就会懊悔。不过无所谓，到时可以穿上袜子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sobered by the cold shower, he returned to the tiny room and dug deep in his rucksack to find something to wear for the Dutch medical students, smelling each item of clothing until they lay in a damp, ripe pile on the worn raffia rug. He settled on the least offensive item, a vintage American short-sleeved shirt, and pulled on some jeans, cut off at the calves and worn with no underwear, so that he felt bold and daredevil. An adventurer, a pioneer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="冷水浴让他清醒了许多，回到狭小的房间后他开始在旅行包里翻找衣服，准备会那些学医的荷兰女生。一件一件地嗅过来，又一件一件地堆在棕榈纤维毯上，那潮乎乎的一坨，散出刺鼻的气味。最终选了一件美国的名牌短袖衬衫，配了一条七分牛仔裤，没穿内裤就直接往腿上一套。如此一来他更自觉是个莽男儿、粗爷们，探险的勇士、开路的先锋。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And then he saw the letter. Six blue sheets densely written on both sides. He stared at it as if an intruder had left it behind, and with his new sobriety came the first twinge of doubt. Picking it up gingerly, he glanced at a page at random and immediately looked away, his mouth puckered tight. All those capitals and exclamation marks and awful jokes. He had called her "sexy", he had used the word "discersion" which wasn't even a proper word. He sounded like some poetry-reading sixth-former, not a pioneer, an adventurer with a shaved head and a tattoo and no underpants beneath his jeans. I will find you, I've been thinking about you, Dex and Em, Em and Dex -- what was he thinking? What had seemed urgent and touching an hour ago now seemed mawkish and gauche and sometimes frankly deceitful; there had been no praying mantis on the wall, he hadn't been listening to her compilation tape as he wrote, had lost his cassette player in Goa. Clearly the letter would change everything, and weren't things fine just as they were? Did he really want Emma with him in India, laughing at his tattoo, making smart remarks? Would he have to kiss her at the airport? Would they have to share a bed? Did he really want to see her that much?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后他又瞧见了那封信，六张蓝色的信笺正反面都写满了。他盯着看，仿佛它们是什么不速之客闯进来后留下的东西。而此刻的清醒叫他心生疑惑，小心地拿起来瞥了一页，紧抿着双唇。所有的加大号字体、惊叹号，以及蹩脚笑话。他称她“性感”，还用了“判定”这样的词，简直不知所云。它像出自一名还在耽读诗歌的高中生，哪有一点剃光头、文文身、不穿内裤的先锋、勇士气概？等你，记挂你，德克斯和爱姆，爱姆和德克斯……他是怎么想的？一个小时以前还迫不及待想去做的事情此刻却显得恶心不堪，有几处简直是欺人之谈。写信时墙上压根没有螳螂，也没有在听她的磁带，因为卡带机在果阿弄丢了。这封信显然会改变一切，而现状难道不好吗？他是否真的想要爱玛来印度，听她取笑文身、发表高论？接机时要不要吻她？是否得共睡一张床？真的那么想见她？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Shortly after nine that night, Dexter left the bar with Renee van Houten, a trainee pharmacist from Rotterdam with fading henna on her hands, a jar of temazepam in her pocket and a poorly executed tattoo of Woody Woodpecker at the base of her spine.

<div class="line_en">In their eagerness to leave, Dexter and his new friend accidentally jostled Heidi Schindler, twenty-three years old, a chemical engineering student from Cologne. Heidi swore at Dexter, but in German, and quietly enough for them not to hear. Pushing through the crowded bar, she shrugged off her immense backpack and searched the room for somewhere to collapse. Heidi's features were red and round, like a series of overlapping circles, an effect exaggerated by her round spectacles, now steamy in the hot humid bar. Bad-tempered, bloated on Diocalm, angry with the friends who kept running off without her, she collapsed backwards on a decrepit rattan sofa and absorbed the full scale of her misery. She removed her steamy spectacles, wiped them on the corner of her t-shirt, settled on the sofa and felt something hard jab into her hip. Quietly, she swore again.</div>

<div class="line_en">Heidi's English wasn't particularly strong, and some words were unfamiliar -- "discersion" for example, but she understood enough to recognise this as a letter of some importance, the kind of letter that she would like to receive herself one day. Not quite a love-letter, but near enough. She pictured this "Em" person reading it, then re-reading it, exasperated but a little pleased too, and she imagined her acting upon it, walking out of her terrible flat and the rotten job and changing her life. Heidi imagined Emma Morley, who looked not unlike herself, waiting at the Taj Mahal as a handsome blond man approached. She imagined a kiss and Heidi began to feel a little happier. She decided that, whatever happened, Emma Morley must receive this letter.</div>
