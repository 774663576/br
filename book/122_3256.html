<div class="line_en">We arrived at Kiel at one o'clock in the morning, and the next day we made our preparations for exploring the North Sea sandbanks. We bought food, oil, and plenty of warm clothes, and I wrote to my boss at the Foreign Office, requesting another week or two of holiday. I asked him to send his reply to me at the post office in Norderney, as Davies and I had no fixed address. When we were ready, we sailed the Dulcibella through the huge iron gates of the ship canal that connects Germany's two seas, the North Sea and the Baltic. For two days, with some of the largest ships in the world, we travelled slowly through the great waterway, wondering at the engineering and organizational ability of the nation that had created it.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“不会的，她要去北海了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Not 'he', Captain. It was a young lady," replied the official. He smiled knowingly. "She wanted to know if you had gone through the canal. It's a pity you missed her."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不是‘他’，船长，是位年轻小姐。”官员会意地一笑，“她想知道你们有没有从运河走。你们错过了她，真是遗憾呀。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, we'll probably see her in Hamburg," I said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好吧，我们很可能会在汉堡碰到她呢。”我说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">With the strong tide, we soon reached Cuxhaven. Davies's plan was to explore the sandbanks between the Scharhörn and Cuxhaven, to find the channels and put them on his charts. Soon I realized that banks of yellow and brown sand were appearing to the west of us. Davies was looking delighted, as we left the main channel and sailed westwards, straight for the sandbanks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="潮水很急，我们不久就到达了库克斯港。戴维斯的计划是考察沙尔赫恩岛和库克斯港之间的沙洲，找到其中的航道并标在海图上。很快，我发现船的西边出现了浅滩，上面布满棕黄色的沙子。我们离开主航道，一路向西朝沙洲驶去，这时，戴维斯变得兴高采烈起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No," he answered. "But don't worry, Captain. There are plenty of pretty girls in Hamburg." He laughed, and went on to the next boat, as Davies returned with the milk.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没有。”官员回答，“不过别担心，船长，汉堡有好多漂亮姑娘呢。”他笑着走向下一艘船，这时戴维斯刚好带着牛奶回来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We were in an extremely narrow channel. While I measured the depth of the water with the lead line, and called out the metres, Davies steered, pulled in the sails, and kept an eye on the chart. But in spite of our carefulness, there was a bumping sound from below, and we ran aground.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们进入了一条非常狭窄的水道。我用水砣绳测量水深，大声报出读数，戴维斯负责掌舵、收帆，同时注意着海图。尽管我们很小心，但还是听到脚下“砰”的一声，船搁浅了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Centreboard up," he cried. "Now for some real sailing!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“升起中插板！”他喊道，“真正的航行开始啦！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When we went back on deck, it was low tide, and the yacht was sitting on the top of a sandbank. As far as the eye could see, there was nothing but sand, broken here and there by the winding path of a channel. Some of these channels still held water, but others had dried out completely. Under a dull grey sky, the wind blew across this wide empty space, crying softly like a child in pain. It seemed the saddest, loneliest place on earth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们回到甲板上时，水位正低，游艇停在一块沙洲顶上。视线所及之处全是沙子，其间零星分布着蜿蜒的水道。一些水道里还有水，另一些则完全干涸了。阴沉灰暗的天空下，风吹过这片空旷的沙洲，发出好似孩子在疼痛中轻声抽噎的声音。这里仿佛是地球上最阴郁、最孤独的地方。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"There's nothing to worry about," Davies said cheerfully. "When the tide rises, we'll float off the sandbank. This is a good moment to have lunch."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不用担心，”戴维斯轻快地说，“涨潮的时候我们就能从沙洲上漂起来了。现在正好吃午饭。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Davies, however, had climbed the mast and was examining the sand enthusiastically. His face shone with pleasure. I had never seen him look happier.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，戴维斯却爬上了桅杆，热切地审视着沙洲，脸上洋溢着快乐。我从没见他这么开心过。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We raised the sail and set off, following the channel we had just explored. All around us stretched the sea, with nothing to show where the channel was. I felt completely lost, but Davies was his usual confident self. He made me call out the depth of water every few seconds, while he steered carefully, feeling for the edge of the sandbank.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们升帆起航，沿着刚刚考察过的航道行驶。四周全是海水，完全看不出航道的位置。我彻底昏了头，而戴维斯却仍像往常那样自信。他每隔几秒就让我大声报出水深，同时他则小心地掌着舵，摸索着寻找沙洲边缘。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"There!" he cried. "You see what I mean? Have you ever seen anything like this?" He climbed down and then jumped down on to the sandbank. "Come on!" he called. "The only way to understand a place like this is to explore it at low tide."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“瞧！”他叫道，“你懂我的意思了吧？你见过这样的景象吗？”他爬下桅杆，跳到了沙洲上。“来吧！”他喊，“要把这种地方搞清楚，唯一的方法就是在落潮时实地考察一下。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Right!" he said when he had finished. "Now let's get back to the Dulcibella. This tide's rising fast."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好了！”完成之后他说，“现在咱们回船上吧。潮水涨得很快呢。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I joined him, and together we ran over the sandbanks as fast as our heavy rubber boots would let us. Davies noted down every post or marker, and every bend in the channels, on his chart.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我也跳下船，我们穿着沉重的橡胶靴一起在沙洲上奔跑，能跑多快就跑多快。戴维斯把每一根标杆、每一处标志，以及航道的每一个转弯都记在了他的海图上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We turned, and ran for the yacht. I was thankful to reach it in time, before the sands were completely covered by the incoming tide. I stood on deck, and watched the sea making its way across the desert of sand. Under my feet the Dulcibella gave a jump, paused, gave another jump, and was suddenly floating again on the grey waters, which now hid the wide area of sand where Davies and I had just walked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们转身朝游艇跑去。很幸运我们及时赶了回去，之后，整个沙洲都被涌进来的潮水覆盖了。我站在甲板上，看着海水一点点漫过沙洲。脚下的船一震，停了一下，接着又一震，突然间就在灰色的水面上重新漂浮起来。此时，我和戴维斯刚刚走过的大片沙洲，已经全部被水覆盖了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“好了！抛锚吧，”他终于说道，“把帆也降下来。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And sure enough, we could hear the waves crashing on the sandbank. As darkness fell, the wind grew fiercer, and the sea rougher. This was the first time we had anchored at night out of sight of land, and I found it a frightening experience as the Dulcibella rolled from side to side and the sea thundered on the sandbank. But I knew now that Davies was a yachtsman of extraordinary skill, and if he said that we were perfectly safe, then safe we were.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="果真，我们听到了海浪拍打沙洲的声音。天黑下来，风更猛了，浪头也更大了。这是我们第一次在看不见陆地的地方停泊过夜，“达尔茜贝拉”号左右摇晃着，海浪拍打着沙洲，发出轰隆隆的响声，十分可怕。但此时我已经知道戴维斯驾驶游艇的技术高超，只要他说我们没事，我们就没事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was getting dark. The German coast had already disappeared, and the sea all around us looked exactly the same to me. But I knew that Davies carried a picture in his head of the complicated pattern of the sands around and beneath us, which he had already charted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="天色渐暗。德国的海岸线已经完全不见了，四周的海域在我看来毫无二致。但我知道戴维斯脑子里装着一幅海图，上面画着周围和船下沙洲的复杂走向，这些他早已在海图上绘制下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Where are we?" I asked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们到哪儿了？”我问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Nothing happened in the next ten days to disturb us at our work. We spent all the daylight hours exploring the sandbanks and channels around Cuxhaven, and marking the changes on the charts. We found nothing to explain why Dollmann wanted to get rid of Davies, and nobody asked questions or tried to stop us.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接下来的10天里，没有什么事情干扰我们的工作。白天，我们把全部时间都用来探索库克斯港附近的沙洲和航道，把变更标记在海图上。我们没有找到多尔曼想除掉戴维斯的原因，也没有人询问我们或试图阻止我们。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"In the shelter of the Hohenhörn, in the channel where Bartels took me that night. If you listen, you can hear the waves breaking on the Hohenhörn, where I went aground."</div>

<div class="line_en">So we left the Cuxhaven area, and set sail for the Frisian Islands. Helped by a strong easterly wind, we sailed all the way without stopping. We reached the island of Wangeroog just before dark, and ran the Dulcibella aground on the sand a hundred metres from the shore. There were three fishing boats anchored about a kilometre from us. Davies set out on foot across the sand to get fresh water and oil, leaving me alone on the yacht.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是我们离开库克斯港这一带，向弗里西亚群岛进发。在强劲东风的推动下，我们一口气走完了这段航程，天黑前到达旺格岛。我们把“达尔茜贝拉”号停泊在离岸100米的一座沙洲旁，一公里外的地方停着三艘渔船。戴维斯步行穿过沙洲去买淡水和油，游艇上只剩下我自己。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I was wide awake in a second, and sat up and listened. The call came again, "Hello there, on the yacht!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我立刻清醒过来，坐起身来倾听。喊声又来了：“嗨！船上有人吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm sure it's something to do with these channels through the sands," said Davies at last. "But nobody seems to mind our being here. The answer to the riddle must be near where I first met Dollmann, at Norderney."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我确定事情和沙洲之间的航道有关。”终于，戴维斯说，“可是似乎没人介意我们在这儿。谜底一定藏在诺德奈，我和多尔曼初次相遇的地方。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Make sure you keep the light burning on the mast," he said as he left. "It's my only guide back to the yacht."</div>

<div class="line_en">It had been an exhausting day and I was feeling very tired, so I lay down on the seat in the cabin. I was half asleep when I heard footsteps on the sand outside, and then a voice calling in German, "Hello there, on the yacht!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="忙了一整天，我觉得非常累，便躺在了船舱的座椅上。半睡半醒之间，我听到外面沙洲上有脚步声，接着一个声音用德语喊道：“嗨！船上有人吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I don't think the local Germans would steal from a yacht," replied Davies. "And they wouldn't put out the mast light. They're all seamen and know how important it is."</div>

<div class="line_en">I did not reply. Was this, I wondered, something to do with the mystery? I heard someone climb onto the deck of the Dulcibella. Suddenly the light on the mast went out. The visitor walked along the deck to the doorway, and began to climb down the ladder into the cabin. I should have waited until he was down, but I was too eager to catch him. I jumped towards the ladder and caught hold of a leg. My unknown visitor kicked out, pulled himself free, and reached the deck, leaving me holding a boot. I rushed up on deck after him, but he was too fast for me, and I did not manage to catch him. I thought of Davies coming back with the oil and water, unable to find the yacht, so I quickly relit the mast light.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我没有回答，心想，这件事会和那个谜团有关吗？我听到有人登上了“达尔茜贝拉”号的甲板，桅杆上的灯突然灭了。来人沿着甲板走到船舱入口处，开始沿着梯子往下爬。我本该等到他完全下来的，可当时我太急着要捉住他，于是跳到梯子旁，抓住那人的一条腿。不速之客一阵猛踢，脱身爬到甲板上，我手里只攥着一只靴子。我冲上甲板追他，可他跑得太快了，我没能追上。我怕戴维斯买油买水回来找不到我们的游艇，就赶紧把桅杆上的灯点着了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We sat up late looking at the chart. There were seven islands in the German Frisian group, separated from the coast by the sands, which were mostly dry at low tide. There were small villages, just a few houses and a church, on most of the islands. Norderney had the only harbour. It was quite a busy little seaside town in the summer, but it was almost empty for the rest of the year. The mainland had no large towns either, just a few small villages. Davies pointed to the row of islands on the chart. "Just look at the fine, sheltered harbour hidden between these islands and the coast! It's fifty kilometres long and ten kilometres wide, perfect for small gunboats."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们研究海图到很晚。德属弗里西亚群岛共有七座岛屿，岛屿和海岸之间隔着沙洲，大部分沙洲落潮时都露出海面。多数岛屿上都有小村庄，不过是几座房子和一所教堂罢了。唯一的港口在诺德奈，夏天这座海滨小镇颇为繁华，其他季节则几乎是空城一座。沿海的大陆上也没有什么大城镇，只有一些小村庄。戴维斯指着海图上的这一串岛屿说：“看看群岛和海岸之间的这片港湾！多好，多隐蔽！50公里长、10公里宽，对于小型炮艇再适合不过了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We discussed what to do. The charts we were using, with all our corrections and notes, were the only things anyone might want to see, so we decided to hide them and the log-book. Now if anyone came on board, they would think we were just two harmless young men, on an autumn sailing holiday.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们商量该怎么办。我们使用的海图是别人唯一可能想看的东西，因为上面有那些更正和标注。于是我们决定把海图和航海日志藏起来。这样如果有人来到船上，也会觉得我们只是两个利用秋季假期出海航行的年轻人，不构成任何威胁。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="第二天，我们考察了旺格岛周围的航道。之前的三艘渔船只剩下了一艘，经过这艘船时，我看见它的名字叫“鸬鹚”号。当天下午晚些时候，在岛屿外围的海域，一艘灰色的小型军舰缓缓驶过。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"So there are," said Davies. "They're probably just big enough for the local fishing boats."</div>

<div class="line_en">As it happened, we went to Bensersiel sooner than we had expected. Two days later a strong south-west wind began to blow, promising storms to follow. We saw that the Blitz had already taken shelter, and was now anchored just south of Spiekeroog, next to several fishing boats. During the afternoon, the wind went round to the north-east -- a bad sign, Davies said -- and the sky turned black, bringing violent rainstorms. We decided to shelter at Bensersiel and had an exciting run through the sandbanks and a very rough sea to the shore, where with great skill Davies managed to bring us safely into the tiny harbour. He, of course, always preferred to anchor for the night away from the shore, but I was glad to step on to dry land, after more than two weeks at sea.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因为这件事，我们提早动身去了贝瑟西尔。两天后，刮起了猛烈的西南风，预示着暴风雨要来了。我们看见“闪电”号就停泊在施皮克罗格南面，在几艘渔船旁边，已经做好了躲避风雨的准备。下午，风向转为东北——戴维斯说这是个坏兆头——天空变成黑色，狂风暴雨随即而来。我们决定去贝瑟西尔躲避一下。我们在沙洲之间快速穿行，迎着狂风巨浪到达岸边，一路真是惊心动魄。好在戴维斯技巧纯熟，把我们的船成功开进了小小的港口。当然了，他总是宁愿在远离岸边的地方过夜，而我，经过两个多星期的海上航行，则很乐意再次踏上陆地。">查看中文翻译</div>
