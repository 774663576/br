<div class="line_en">Adèle and I had now to vacate the library: it would be in daily requisition as a reception-room for callers. A fire was lit in an apartment upstairs, and there I carried our books, and arranged it for the future schoolroom. I discerned in the course of the morning that Thornfield Hall was a changed place: no longer silent as a church, it echoed every hour or two to a knock at the door, or a clang of the bell; steps, too, often traversed the hall, and new voices spoke in different keys below; a rill from the outer world was flowing through it; it had a master: for my part, I liked it better.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mr. Rochester, it seems, by the surgeon's orders, went to bed early that night; nor did he rise soon next morning. When he did come down, it was to attend to business: his agent and some of his tenants were arrived, and waiting to speak with him.</div>

<div class="line_en">Adèle was not easy to teach that day; she could not apply: she kept running to the door and looking over the banisters to see if she could get a glimpse of Mr. Rochester; then she coined pretexts to go downstairs, in order, as I shrewdly suspected, to visit the library, where I knew she was not wanted; then, when I got a little angry, and made her sit still, she continued to talk incessantly of her "ami, Monsieur Edouard Fairfax DE Rochester," as she dubbed him (I had not before heard his prenomens), and to conjecture what presents he had brought her: for it appears he had intimated the night before, that when his luggage came from Millcote, there would be found amongst it a little box in whose contents she had an interest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天阿黛勒不大好教。她静不下心来，不往往门边跑，从栏杆上往下张望，看看能不能瞧一眼罗切斯特先生。随后编造出一些借口来，要到楼下去，我一下就猜到是为了到书房去走走，我知道那儿并不需要她。随后，见我有点儿生气了，并让她好好儿坐着，她就不断唠叨起她的“费尔法克斯的朋友爱德华先生”，她就这么称呼他（而我以前从末听到过他的教名），还想象着他给她带来了什么礼物。因为他似乎在前天晚上提起过，他的行李从米尔科特运到后，内中会有一个小匣子，匣子里的东西她很感兴趣。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Et cela doit signifier," said she, "qu'il y aura le dedans un cadeau pour moi, et peut-etre pour vous aussi, mademoiselle. Monsieur a parle de vous: il m'a demande le nom de ma gouvernante, et si elle n'etait pas une petite personne, assez mince et un peu pale. J'ai dit qu'oui: car c'est vrai, n'est-ce pas, mademoiselle?"</div>

<div class="line_en">In the clear embers I was tracing a view, not unlike a picture I remembered to have seen of the castle of Heidelberg, on the Rhine, when Mrs. Fairfax came in, breaking up by her entrance the fiery mosaic I had been piercing together, and scattering too some heavy unwelcome thoughts that were beginning to throng on my solitude.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在明亮的余烬中，我仿佛看到了一种景象，颇似我记得曾见过的莱茵河上海德堡城堡的风景画。这时费尔法克斯太太闯了进来，打碎了我还在拼凑的火红镶嵌画，也驱散了我孤寂中开始凝聚起来的沉闷而不受欢迎的念头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I and my pupil dined as usual in Mrs. Fairfax's parlour; the afternoon was wild and snowy, and we passed it in the schoolroom. At dark I allowed Adèle to put away books and work, and to run downstairs; for, from the comparative silence below, and from the cessation of appeals to the door-bell, I conjectured that Mr. Rochester was now at liberty. Left alone, I walked to the window; but nothing was to be seen thence: twilight and snowflakes together thickened the air, and hid the very shrubs on the lawn. I let down the curtain and went back to the fireside.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我和我的学生照例又在费尔法克斯太太的客厅里用餐。下午风雪交加，我们呆在读书室里。天黑时我允许阿黛勒放下书和作业，奔到楼下去，因为下面已比较安静，门铃声也已消停，想必罗切斯特先生此刻有空了。房间里只剩下了我一个人，我便走到窗子跟前，但那儿什么也看不见。暮色和雪片使空气混混沌沌，连草坪上的灌木也看不清楚了。我放下窗帘，回到了火炉边。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This additional ceremony seemed somewhat stately; however, I repaired to my room, and, with Mrs. Fairfax's aid, replaced my black stuff dress by one of black silk; the best and the only additional one I had, except one of light grey, which, in my Lowood notions of the toilette, I thought too fine to be worn, except on first-rate occasions.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这额外的礼节似乎有些庄重，不过我还是上自己的房间去了。在费尔法克斯太太的帮助下，把黑色呢衣换成了一件黑丝绸衣服，这是除了一套淡灰色衣服外，我最好的，也是唯一一套额外的衣装。以我的罗沃德服饰观念而言，我想除了头等重要的场合，这套服装是过于讲究而不宜穿的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes, you had better: I always dress for the evening when Mr. Rochester is here."</div>

<div class="line_en">"You want a brooch," said Mrs. Fairfax. I had a single little pearl ornament which Miss Temple gave me as a parting keepsake: I put it on, and then we went downstairs. Unused as I was to strangers, it was rather a trial to appear thus formally summoned in Mr. Rochester's presence. I let Mrs. Fairfax precede me into the dining-room, and kept in her shade as we crossed that apartment; and, passing the arch, whose curtain was now dropped, entered the elegant recess beyond.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你需要一枚饰针，”费尔法克斯太太说。我只有一件珍珠小饰品，是坦普尔小姐作为临别礼物送给我的，我把它戴上了。随后我们下了楼梯。我由于怕生，觉得这么一本正经被罗切斯特先生召见，实在是活受罪。去餐室时，我让费尔法克斯太太走在我前面，自己躲在她暗影里，穿过房间，路过此刻放下了窗帘的拱门，进了另一头高雅精致的内室。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Two wax candles stood lighted on the table, and two on the mantelpiece; basking in the light and heat of a superb fire, lay Pilot -- Adèle knelt near him. Half reclined on a couch appeared Mr. Rochester, his foot supported by the cushion; he was looking at Adèle and the dog: the fire shone full on his face. I knew my traveller with his broad and jetty eyebrows; his square forehead, made squarer by the horizontal sweep of his black hair. I recognised his decisive nose, more remarkable for character than beauty; his full nostrils, denoting, I thought, choler; his grim mouth, chin, and jaw -- yes, all three were very grim, and no mistake. His shape, now divested of cloak, I perceived harmonised in squareness with his physiognomy: I suppose it was a good figure in the athletic sense of the term -- broad chested and thin flanked, though neither tall nor graceful.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两支蜡烛点在桌上，两支点在壁炉台上。派洛特躺着，沐浴在一堆旺火的光和热之中，阿黛勒跪在它旁边。罗切斯特先生半倚在睡榻上，脚下垫着坐垫。他正端详着阿黛勒和狗，炉火映出了他的脸。我知道我见过的这位赶路人有着浓密的宽眉，方正的额头，上面横流着的一片黑发，使额头显得更加方正。我认得他那坚毅的鼻子，它与其说是因为英俊，倒还不如说显出了性格而引人注目。他那丰满的鼻孔，我想，表明他容易发怒。他那严厉的嘴巴、下额和颅骨，是的，三者都很严厉，一点都不错。我发现，他此刻脱去斗篷以后的身材，同他容貌的方正很相配。我想从运动员的角度看，他胸宽腰细，身材很好，尽管既不高大，也不优美。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mr. Rochester must have been aware of the entrance of Mrs. Fairfax and myself; but it appeared he was not in the mood to notice us, for he never lifted his head as we approached.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Let Miss Eyre be seated," said he: and there was something in the forced stiff bow, in the impatient yet formal tone, which seemed further to express, "What the deuce is it to me whether Miss Eyre be there or not? At this moment I am not disposed to accost her."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“让爱小姐坐下吧，”他说。他僵硬勉强的点头样子，不耐烦而又一本正经的说话语气，另有一番意思，似乎进一步表示，“活’见鬼，爱小姐在不在同我有什么关系？现在我不想同她打招呼。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Here is Miss Eyre, sir," said Mrs. Fairfax, in her quiet way. He bowed, still not taking his eyes from the group of the dog and child.</div>

<div class="line_en">I sat down quite disembarrassed. A reception of finished politeness would probably have confused me: I could not have returned or repaid it by answering grace and elegance on my part; but harsh caprice laid me under no obligation; on the contrary, a decent quiescence, under the freak of manner, gave me the advantage. Besides, the eccentricity of the proceeding was piquant: I felt interested to see how he would go on.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我坐了下来，一点也不窘。礼仪十足地接待我，倒反会使我手足无措，因为在我来说，无法报之以温良恭谦。而粗鲁任性可以使我不必拘礼，相反，行为古怪又合乎礼仪的沉默，却给我带来了方便。此外，这反常接待议程也是够有意思的，我倒有兴趣看看他究竟如何继续下去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He went on as a statue would, that is, he neither spoke nor moved. Mrs. Fairfax seemed to think it necessary that some one should be amiable, and she began to talk. Kindly, as usual -- and, as usual, rather trite -- she condoled with him on the pressure of business he had had all day; on the annoyance it must have been to him with that painful sprain: then she commended his patience and perseverance in going through with it.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“因为我对自己是否配得礼物，不像阿黛勒那么有信心，她可凭老关系老习惯提出要求，因为她说你一贯送她玩具，但如果要我发表看法的话，我就不知道该怎么说了，因为我是个陌生人，没有做过什么值得感谢的事情。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">These pictures were in water-colours. The first represented clouds low and livid, rolling over a swollen sea: all the distance was in eclipse; so, too, was the foreground; or rather, the nearest billows, for there was no land. One gleam of light lifted into relief a half-submerged mast, on which sat a cormorant, dark and large, with wings flecked with foam; its beak held a gold bracelet set with gems, that I had touched with as brilliant tints as my palette could yield, and as glittering distinctness as my pencil could impart. Sinking below the bird and mast, a drowned corpse glanced through the green water; a fair arm was the only limb clearly visible, whence the bracelet had been washed or torn.</div>

<div class="line_en">The second picture contained for foreground only the dim peak of a hill, with grass and some leaves slanting as if by a breeze. Beyond and above spread an expanse of sky, dark blue as at twilight: rising into the sky was a woman's shape to the bust, portrayed in tints as dusk and soft as I could combine. The dim forehead was crowned with a star; the lineaments below were seen as through the suffusion of vapour; the eyes shone dark and wild; the hair streamed shadowy, like a beamless cloud torn by storm or by electric travail. On the neck lay a pale reflection like moonlight; the same faint lustre touched the train of thin clouds from which rose and bowed this vision of the Evening Star.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二张画的前景只有一座朦胧的山峰，青草和树叶似乎被微风吹歪了。在远处和上方铺开了一片薄暮时分深蓝色的浩瀚天空。一个女人的半身形体高耸天际，色调被我尽力点染得柔和与暗淡。模糊的额头上点缀着一颗星星，下面的脸部仿佛透现在雾气蒸腾之中。双目乌黑狂野、炯炯有神。头发如阴影一般飘洒，仿佛是被风爆和闪电撕下的暗淡无光的云块。脖子上有一抹宛若月色的淡淡反光，一片片薄云也有着同样浅色的光泽，云端里升起了低着头的金星的幻象。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The third showed the pinnacle of an iceberg piercing a polar winter sky: a muster of northern lights reared their dim lances, close serried, along the horizon. Throwing these into distance, rose, in the foreground, a head, -- a colossal head, inclined towards the iceberg, and resting against it. Two thin hands, joined under the forehead, and supporting it, drew up before the lower features a sable veil, a brow quite bloodless, white as bone, and an eye hollow and fixed, blank of meaning but for the glassiness of despair, alone were visible. Above the temples, amidst wreathed turban folds of black drapery, vague in its character and consistency as cloud, gleamed a ring of white flame, gemmed with sparkles of a more lurid tinge. This pale crescent was "the likeness of a kingly crown;" what it diademed was "the shape which shape had none."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第三幅画的是一座冰山的尖顶，刺破了北极冬季的天空，一束束北极光举起了它们毫无光泽、密布在地平线上的长矛。在画的前景上，一个头颅赫然入目，冰山退隐到了远处，一个巨大无比的头，侧向冰山，枕在上面。头部底下伸出一双手，支撑着它，拉起了一块黑色的面纱。罩住下半部面孔。额头毫无血色，苍白如骨。深陷的眼睛凝视着，除了露出绝望的木然神色，别无其他表情。在两鬓之上，黑色缠头布的皱裥中，射出了一圈如云雾般变幻莫测的白炽火焰，镶嵌着红艳艳的火星，这苍白的新月是“王冠的写真”，为“无形之形”加冕。">查看中文翻译</div>

These eyes in the Evening Star you must have seen in a dream. How could you make them look so clear, and yet not at all brilliant? for the planet above quells their rays. And what meaning is that in their solemn depth? And who taught you to paint wind? There is a high gale in that sky, and on this hill-top. Where did you see Latmos? For that is Latmos.

<div class="line_en">"Why, no -- perhaps not. I believe there were some misunderstandings between them. Mr. Rowland Rochester was not quite just to Mr. Edward; and perhaps he prejudiced his father against him. The old gentleman was fond of money, and anxious to keep the family estate together. He did not like to diminish the property by division, and yet he was anxious that Mr. Edward should have wealth, too, to keep up the consequence of the name; and, soon after he was of age, some steps were taken that were not quite fair, and made a great deal of mischief. Old Mr. Rochester and Mr. Rowland combined to bring Mr. Edward into what he considered a painful position, for the sake of making his fortune: what the precise nature of that position was I never clearly knew, but his spirit could not brook what he had to suffer in it. He is not very forgiving: he broke with his family, and now for many years he has led an unsettled kind of life. I don't think he has ever been resident at Thornfield for a fortnight together, since the death of his brother without a will left him master of the estate; and, indeed, no wonder he shuns the old place."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“唉，不——也许不是。我想他们之间有些隔阂。罗兰特·罗切斯特先生对爱德华先生不很公平，也许就是他弄得他父亲对爱德华先生怀有偏见。这位老先生爱钱，急于使家产合在一起，不希望因为分割而缩小。同时又很想让爱德华先生有自己的一份财产，以保持这名字的荣耀。他成年后不久，他们采取了一些不十分合理的办法，造成了很大麻烦。为了使爱德华先生获得那份财产，老罗切斯特先生和罗兰特先生一起，使爱德华先生陷入了他自认为痛苦的境地，这种境遇的确切性质，我从来都不十分清楚，但在精神上他无法忍受不得不忍受的一切。他不愿忍让，便与家庭决裂。多年来，他一直过着一种漂泊不定的生活。我想打从他哥哥没有留下遗嘱就去世，他自己成了房产的主人后，他从来没有在桑菲尔德一连住上过二周。说实在，也难怪他要躲避这个老地方。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The answer was evasive. I should have liked something clearer; but Mrs. Fairfax either could not, or would not, give me more explicit information of the origin and nature of Mr. Rochester's trials. She averred they were a mystery to herself, and that what she knew was chiefly from conjecture. It was evident, indeed, that she wished me to drop the subject, which I did accordingly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她的回答闪烁其辞。我本想了解得更透彻些，但费尔法克斯太太兴许不能够，抑或不愿意，向我进一步提供关于罗切斯特先生痛苦的始末和性质。她一口咬定，对她本人来说也是个谜，她所知道的多半是她自己的猜测，说真的，她显然希望我搁下这个话题，于是我也就不再多问了。">查看中文翻译</div>
