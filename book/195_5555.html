<div class="line_en">One morning Philip on getting up felt his head swim, and going back to bed suddenly discovered he was ill. All his limbs ached and he shivered with cold. When the landlady brought in his breakfast he called to her through the open door that he was not well, and asked for a cup of tea and a piece of toast. A few minutes later there was a knock at his door, and Griffiths came in. They had lived in the same house for over a year, but had never done more than nod to one another in the passage.</div>

<div class="line_en">Norah and Griffiths nursed him between them. Though Griffiths was the same age as Philip he adopted towards him a humorous, motherly attitude. He was a thoughtful fellow, gentle and encouraging; but his greatest quality was a vitality which seemed to give health to everyone with whom he came in contact. Philip was unused to the petting which most people enjoy from mothers or sisters and he was deeply touched by the feminine tenderness of this strong young man. Philip grew better. Then Griffiths, sitting idly in Philip's room, amused him with gay stories of amorous adventure. He was a flirtatious creature, capable of carrying on three or four affairs at a time; and his account of the devices he was forced to in order to keep out of difficulties made excellent hearing. He had a gift for throwing a romantic glamour over everything that happened to him. He was crippled with debts, everything he had of any value was pawned, but he managed always to be cheerful, extravagant, and generous. He was the adventurer by nature. He loved people of doubtful occupations and shifty purposes; and his acquaintance among the riff-raff that frequents the bars of London was enormous. Loose women, treating him as a friend, told him the troubles, difficulties, and successes of their lives; and card-sharpers, respecting his impecuniosity, stood him dinners and lent him five-pound notes. He was ploughed in his examinations time after time; but he bore this cheerfully, and submitted with such a charming grace to the parental expostulations that his father, a doctor in practice at Leeds, had not the heart to be seriously angry with him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="诺拉和格里菲斯轮班照顾他。虽说格里菲斯和菲利普一般年纪，却像母亲一样把他照顾得无微不至，还总是能惹他发笑。格里菲斯有想法，有魅力，懂得怎样振奋人心。他最大的特点就是永远都精力充沛，不论是谁和他待在一块儿，都会被这种活力所感染。很多人都喜欢被母亲或姐妹悉心照料，可菲利普却很不习惯。然而，他被这个强壮的年轻男人看护得舒舒服服，很快病就好了一多半。格里菲斯闲坐在他的卧室里，讲些自己身上的风流艳遇，哄他开心。他是个花花公子，身边总有两三个暧昧不清的女人。有时候为了摆脱纠缠，不得不使出全身解数。这些经历被他娓娓道来，听得人拍案叫绝。所有发生在他身上的事，都能被他用浪漫色彩粉饰一番。他债台高筑，稍微值点钱的东西都被当掉换钱了，可这丝毫不妨碍他继续挥霍，还是终日乐呵呵的，朋友有难依然慷慨解囊。他天生是个冒险家，喜欢和那些形迹可疑、没有定性的人打交道。他认识的人里不少都是天天往酒馆跑的小混混。很多作风不检点的女人都拿他当朋友，跟他倾诉自己的烦恼、苦闷，哪怕有一点小成功也得向他吹嘘一通。牌场“老千”看他生活困难，时不时请他吃顿饭或者借他五镑。他五次三番地考试不及格，但从来也没因为这事愁眉苦脸过。在利兹当医生的父亲苦口婆心地规劝他，他也一脸乖相地频频点头，搞得老父亲都不忍心冲他发火了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Philip worshipped him as at school he had worshipped boys who were tall and straight and high of spirits. By the time he was well they were fast friends, and it was a peculiar satisfaction to Philip that Griffiths seemed to enjoy sitting in his little parlour, wasting Philip's time with his amusing chatter and smoking innumerable cigarettes. Philip took him sometimes to the tavern off Regent Street. Hayward found him stupid, but Lawson recognised his charm and was eager to paint him; he was a picturesque figure with his blue eyes, white skin, and curly hair. Often they discussed things he knew nothing about, and then he sat quietly, with a good-natured smile on his handsome face, feeling quite rightly that his presence was sufficient contribution to the entertainment of the company. When he discovered that Macalister was a stockbroker he was eager for tips; and Macalister, with his grave smile, told him what fortunes he could have made if he had bought certain stock at certain times. It made Philip's mouth water, for in one way and another he was spending more than he had expected, and it would have suited him very well to make a little money by the easy method Macalister suggested.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="菲利普像在学校崇拜那些又高又壮、精神饱满的男孩一样崇拜格里菲斯。病一好，他们就立刻交上了朋友。格里菲斯坐在菲利普的小屋里，一根接一根地抽烟，讲些让人捧腹的故事陪他消磨时间。他高兴坏了，不时带格里菲斯去摄政大街上的酒馆喝一杯。海沃德觉得格里菲斯很无趣，可劳森却发现他相貌很吸引人，急着想给他画肖像。他的样子适合入画：眼珠儿碧蓝、皮肤雪白、头发卷曲。他们经常谈论些他听不懂的话题，而他就静静坐在一边，好脾气地微笑着，似乎知道自己什么都不用说，只要往那儿一坐就能助兴了。他知道麦卡利斯特是个股票经纪人后，迫不及待想打听点买股票的门道。麦卡利斯特严肃一笑，告诉他在恰当的时候买上支恰当的股票能赚回多少钱来。菲利普听得口水直流。他东花一点、西花一点，老是入不敷出，要是麦卡利斯特说的简便法子真能挣回几个钱来，那简直没有比这更好的事啦。">查看中文翻译</div>
