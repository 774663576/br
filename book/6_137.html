<div class="line_en">The story of my first enquiries in Hampshire is soon told. Not a single person in the village of Blackwater could remember exactly when Sir Percival Glyde had left. Even the gardener at the house could only say it was some time in the last ten days of July.</div>

<div class="line_en">We were lucky. The farmer's wife did know the address, and wrote back by return to tell us. It was in London, not far from our rooms, and the next morning I was knocking at the door.</div>

<div class="line_en">"So, on to the next plan," I said to Marian back in London, "which is to pursue the secret. I need to talk to Anne Catherick's mother, but first I must find out something about her from Mrs Clements, Anne's friend. But how do I find Mrs Clements?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那么，开始下一步行动吧，”回到伦敦我对玛丽安说，“查出那个秘密来。我需要找到安妮·凯瑟里克的母亲，但我必须首先找到安妮的朋友克莱门茨太太，从她那里了解一些情况。可怎么才能找到克莱门茨太太？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Marian had the answer to that. "You remember the farm she and Anne stayed at near Limmeridge? We'll write to them -- they might know Mrs Clements' address."</div>

<div class="line_en">"After leaving Limmeridge, sir," she said, "Anne and I went to live in the northeast of England, and that's when Anne started to suffer from heart disease. She wasn't at all well, but she insisted on travelling to Hampshire, because she wanted to speak to Lady Glyde. So we went there and stayed in a village near Blackwater -- not too close as Anne was so frightened of Sir Percival.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“离开利默里奇以后，先生，”她对我说，“安妮和我去了英国东北部，这个时候安妮得了心脏病。她身体很不好，但她坚持到汉普郡去见格莱德夫人。所以我们就去了那儿，住在布莱克沃特附近的一个村子里——那地方离布莱克沃特不是很近，因为安妮非常害怕珀西瓦尔爵士。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Each time Anne went to the lake to try to speak to Lady Glyde, I followed her at a distance. But the long walks made her so exhausted that she became ill again, so finally I went to the lake in her place to meet Lady Glyde. She didn't come that day, but a very fat man came instead with a message from her. The message was that we should return to London immediately, as Sir Percival would certainly find us if we stayed longer. Lady Glyde was going to London herself very soon and if we sent her our address, she would contact us."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“每一次安妮到湖边去见格莱德夫人，我都在远处跟着她。但是走那么远的路让她非常疲劳，结果她又病了。最后我代替她到湖边去见格莱德夫人。那天格莱德夫人没有来，来的是一个很胖的男人，他捎来了格莱德夫人的口信，让我们赶快回伦敦，因为如果在这里呆久了，珀西瓦尔爵士肯定会发现我们。格莱德夫人自己很快也会到伦敦去，如果我们把地址给她，她会跟我们联系。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But she didn't, did she?" I said, thinking how cleverly Count Fosco had lied to this kind woman.</div>

<div class="line_en">"No, sir. I found lodgings and sent the address to Lady Glyde, but after two weeks we'd still heard nothing. Then one day a lady called in a cab. She said she came from Lady Glyde, who was staying at a hotel and wanted to arrange an interview with Anne. I agreed to go with this lady to make the arrangement, leaving Anne alone in our lodgings. But it was a wicked plot, sir. On the way the lady stopped the cab, saying she just had to collect something from a shop and would I wait for a few minutes. She never came back, sir. I waited for some time, and then I hurried home -- and found Anne gone. Just disappeared."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没错，先生。我找到了住处，把地址寄给了格莱德夫人，可是两个星期过去了，我们没收到任何回音。后来，有一天一位夫人乘马车到这里来。她说她从格莱德夫人那儿来，格莱德夫人住在一家旅店，想安排同安妮见面。我答应同那位夫人去安排见面的事，把安妮一个人留在住处。可这是个恶毒的阴谋，先生。走到半路，那位夫人说要去商店取点儿东西，让我等几分钟。她去了就再没回来，先生。我等了好一阵子，然后赶忙回家——回来后却发现安妮不见了。就这么消失了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"That wasn't difficult," said Mrs Clements. "Mrs Catherick is a hard woman. She seemed to hate the child, and was only too pleased when I offered to bring her up. Then one day she took Anne to Limmeridge to stay with a sister, and after that she kept Anne from me. I didn't see Anne again till she escaped from the asylum -- with your help, sir. And then she was always talking about a secret her mother had which could ruin Sir Percival. But you know, sir, I don't think Anne really knew what this secret was. If she had known, I'm sure she would have told me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那倒没什么难的，”克莱门茨太太说，“凯瑟里克太太是一个铁石心肠的女人。她好像仇视这个孩子，我提出抚养这孩子时，她非常高兴。后来有一天她把安妮带到利默里奇同她的妹妹住在一起。再后来，她就不让我见安妮了。安妮从精神病院逃出来之前，我就再没见到过她。她逃出来还是你帮的忙呢，先生。从那以后，她—直说她母亲知道一个秘密，那秘密会毁了珀西瓦尔爵士。但是，先生，我觉得安妮并不真的知道那个秘密。如果她真的知道，我相信她早就告诉我了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I never found out what happened to Anne," Mrs Clements said sadly. "I made enquiries. I even wrote to her mother, but she didn't know anything. I miss poor Anne so much. She was like a daughter to me, you see, sir."</div>

Before that, Mrs Catherick had been a servant at a large house. She was a selfish, heartless woman, and treated her poor husband very badly. Before long, there was a lot of talk about her and a young gentleman, who was staying at a hotel nearby. And Mr Catherick told my husband that he'd found expensive presents, gold rings and suchlike, hidden in his wife's drawer."</div>

People thought, you see, that maybe Mrs Catherick had known Sir Percival before, and had married Mr Catherick just to save her reputation, because of, well, you know… Anyway, one night Mr Catherick found his wife whispering with Sir Percival outside the vestry of the church. They had a fight, but Sir Percival beat him and Mr Catherick left the village, never to return again. And in spite of all the talk in the village, Mrs Catherick stayed. She said she was innocent and that no one would drive her away. But most people thought that the money she lived on came from Sir Percival."</div>

<div class="line_en">I found the church clerk, who fetched his keys and took me to the vestry. It could only be entered from the outside of the church, and the clerk had great difficulty opening the lock, which was very old. Once inside, I asked to see the marriage register. It was kept in a cupboard which could easily be forced open.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我找到了教堂职员，他找来钥匙，带我来到教堂的法衣室。法衣室只能从教堂外面进去，职员费了好大劲儿才打开那把旧锁。进去以后，我说要看看婚姻登记记录。那些记录放在一个柜子里，柜子的门很容易被撬开。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Safe enough," the clerk said. "A copy is kept by a lawyer in the next village -- Mr Wansborough's office in Knowlesbury."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“很安全，”职员回答，“另一个副本存放在邻村的律师那里，就是万斯伯勒先生的办公室，在诺雷斯伯里。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Is that a safe enough place to keep the register?" I said.</div>

<div class="line_en">I worked backwards in the register from Sir Percival's year of birth and there, under September of the previous year, squashed into a small space at the bottom of the page, was the record of the marriage of Sir Felix Glyde and Cecilia Elster of Knowlesbury. Just the usual information. Nothing apparently peculiar about Sir Percival's mother. The secret seemed further away than ever.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我从珀西瓦尔爵士出生那年的记录开始往前面查，在前一年的9月，有一页在靠下的角落里记着费利克斯·格莱德爵士和诺雷斯伯里的塞西莉亚结婚。只是非常一般的记录，看不出珀西瓦尔爵士的母亲有什么特殊的地方。秘密好像比以前离我更远了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But on to Knowlesbury, and Mr Wansborough's office -- a five-mile walk, but possible to get there and back by the end of the day. It was worth checking the copy of the register, and perhaps the lawyer would know something that might be useful.</div>
