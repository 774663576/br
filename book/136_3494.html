<div class="line_en">In the fender was a battered tin oilstove, a saucepan, and two cups, provided by Mr Charrington. Winston lit the burner and set a pan of water to boil. He had brought an envelope full of Victory Coffee and some saccharine tablets. The clock's hands said seventeen-twenty: it was nineteen-twenty really. She was coming at nineteen-thirty.</div>

<div class="line_en">Folly, folly, his heart kept saying: conscious, gratuitous, suicidal folly. Of all the crimes that a Party member could commit, this one was the least possible to conceal. Actually the idea had first floated into his head in the form of a vision, of the glass paperweight mirrored by the surface of the gateleg table. As he had foreseen, Mr Charrington had made no difficulty about letting the room. He was obviously glad of the few dollars that it would bring him. Nor did he seem shocked or become offensively knowing when it was made clear that Winston wanted the room for the purpose of a love-affair. Instead he looked into the middle distance and spoke in generalities, with so delicate an air as to give the impression that he had become partly invisible. Privacy, he said, was a very valuable thing. Everyone wanted a place where they could be alone occasionally. And when they had such a place, it was only common courtesy in anyone else who knew of it to keep his knowledge to himself. He even, seeming almost to fade out of existence as he did so, added that there were two entries to the house, one of them through the back yard, which gave on an alley.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="愚蠢啊愚蠢，他心里一直嘀咕：简直是有意识的、无谓的、自杀性的愚蠢。一个党员所能犯的各种罪行中，这是最不可能掩盖的罪行，实际上，这个念头最初在他脑海中浮现时是这样一个形象：折叠桌光滑的桌面像镜子一样照出那个镇纸。如他预见的，查林顿先生爽快地答应出租这个房间。他显然很高兴能赚几块钱。当他知道温斯顿租这个房间是为了幽会时，他似乎并不吃惊或有什么不快。相反，他不追根究底，而是泛泛而谈，语气微妙，给人的印象是他会睁一眼闭一眼。他说，隐私是很有价值的东西。每个人都需要一个地方，偶尔可以清静一下。当他们有了这样一个地方，任何人都知道要保守秘密，这是应有的礼节。他甚至还说，这房子有两个入口，其中一个穿过后院，后院通一条小巷，他这么说时似乎慢慢隐去了身影。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Winston looked round the shabby little room above Mr Charrington's shop. Beside the window the enormous bed was made up, with ragged blankets and a coverless bolster. The old-fashioned clock with the twelve-hour face was ticking away on the mantelpiece.

<div class="line_en">Under the window somebody was singing. Winston peeped out, secure in the protection of the muslin curtain. The June sun was still high in the sky, and in the sun-filled court below, a monstrous woman, solid as a Norman pillar, with brawny red forearms and a sacking apron strapped about her middle, was stumping to and fro between a washtub and a clothes line, pegging out a series of square white things which Winston recognized as babies' diapers. Whenever her mouth was not corked with clothes pegs she was singing in a powerful contralto:</div>

<div class="line_en">The tune had been haunting London for weeks past. It was one of countless similar songs published for the benefit of the proles by a sub-section of the Music Department. The words of these songs were composed without any human intervention whatever on an instrument known as a versificator. But the woman sang so tunefully as to turn the dreadful rubbish into an almost pleasant sound. He could hear the woman singing and the scrape of her shoes on the flagstones, and the cries of the children in the street, and somewhere in the far distance a faint roar of traffic, and yet the room seemed curiously silent, thanks to the absence of a telescreen.</div>

<div class="line_en">Folly, folly, folly! he thought again. It was inconceivable that they could frequent this place for more than a few weeks without being caught. But the temptation of having a hiding-place that was truly their own, indoors and near at hand, had been too much for both of them. For some time after their visit to the church belfry it had been impossible to arrange meetings. Working hours had been drastically increased in anticipation of Hate Week. It was more than a month distant, but the enormous, complex preparations that it entailed were throwing extra work on to everybody. Finally both of them managed to secure a free afternoon on the same day. They had agreed to go back to the clearing in the wood. On the evening beforehand they met briefly in the street. As usual, Winston hardly looked at Julia as they drifted towards one another in the crowd, but from the short glance he gave her it seemed to him that she was paler than usual.</div>

<div class="line_en">For a moment he was violently angry. During the month that he had known her the nature of his desire for her had changed. At the beginning there had been little true sensuality in it. Their first love-making had been simply an act of the will. But after the second time it was different. The smell of her hair, the taste of her mouth, the feeling of her skin seemed to have got inside him, or into the air all round him. She had become a physical necessity, something that he not only wanted but felt that he had a right to. When she said that she could not come, he had the feeling that she was cheating him. But just at this moment the crowd pressed them together and their hands accidentally met. She gave the tips of his fingers a quick squeeze that seemed to invite not desire but affection. It struck him that when one lived with a woman this particular disappointment must be a normal, recurring event; and a deep tenderness, such as he had not felt for her before, suddenly took hold of him. He wished that they were a married couple of ten years' standing. He wished that he were walking through the streets with her just as they were doing now but openly and without fear, talking of trivialities and buying odds and ends for the household. He wished above all that they had some place where they could be alone together without feeling the obligation to make love every time they met. It was not actually at that moment, but at some time on the following day, that the idea of renting Mr Charrington's room had occurred to him. When he suggested it to Julia she had agreed with unexpected readiness. Both of them knew that it was lunacy. It was as though they were intentionally stepping nearer to their graves. As he sat waiting on the edge of the bed he thought again of the cellars of the Ministry of Love. It was curious how that predestined horror moved in and out of one's consciousness. There it lay, fixed in future times, preceding death as surely as 99 precedes 100. One could not avoid it, but one could perhaps postpone it: and yet instead, every now and again, by a conscious, wilful act, one chose to shorten the interval before it happened.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他一时极为恼怒，在认识她的一个月内，他对她的欲望的性质有了变化。起初，很少有真正的肉欲。他们第一次做爱只是一种意志的行为。但第二次之后，情况就不同了。她头发的香味、嘴唇的甜美、皮肤的柔软似乎渗进他的体内，或融入他周围的空气之中。她已经成了他的肉体需要，他不仅想拥有，而且觉得有权拥有。当她说来不了，他的感觉是她在欺骗他。但此时，人群把他们挤到一起，他们的手意外相碰。她飞快地捏了一下他的手指，这不像是渴望，而是爱的表示。他想到，生活中有个女人，遭遇失望必定是一件正常的、也会一再发生的事情；他突然产生了一种强烈的柔情，而之前他对她的感受还没有如此强烈过。他希望他们是一对结婚已经十年的夫妻。他希望他和她一起走在大街上，就和刚才一样，但不必偷偷摸摸，也没有恐惧，拉着家常，采购日常生活用品。他更希望有一个地方，可以让他们单独相处，而不必觉得每次见面非做爱不可。实际上不是在那个时候，而是在第二天，他起了要租下查林顿先生的房间的念头。当他向朱丽亚说起此事，没想到她一口答应了。他们都知道这是一种愚蠢的行为。这就好像他们有意识地朝他们的坟墓走近。当他坐在床边等她的时候，他又想起友爱部的地下室。奇怪的是，那种命中注定的恐怖是如何出没于一个人的意识？这种恐怖会出现在未来的某个时间，出现在死亡之前，如同九十九肯定出现在一百之前一样。人无法躲开，但也许可以拖延；而反之，通过有意识的、自觉的行动，人偶尔也可以选择将它发生之前的间隔时间缩短。">查看中文翻译</div>

She was carrying a tool-bag of coarse brown canvas, such as he had sometimes seen her carrying to and fro at the Ministry.

One had the feeling that she would have been perfectly content, if the June evening had been endless and the supply of clothes inexhaustible, to remain there for a thousand years, pegging out diapers and singing rubbish. It struck him as a curious fact that he had never heard a member of the Party singing alone and spontaneously. It would even have seemed slightly unorthodox, a dangerous eccentricity, like talking to oneself. Perhaps it was only when people were somewhere near the starvation level that they had anything to sing about.</div>

<div class="line_en">He turned round, and for a second almost failed to recognize her. What he had actually expected was to see her naked. But she was not naked. The transformation that had happened was much more surprising than that. She had painted her face.</div>

<div class="line_en">She must have slipped into some shop in the proletarian quarters and bought herself a complete set of make-up materials. Her lips were deeply reddened, her cheeks rouged, her nose powdered; there was even a touch of something under the eyes to make them brighter. It was not very skilfully done, but Winston's standards in such matters were not high. He had never before seen or imagined a woman of the Party with cosmetics on her face. The improvement in her appearance was startling. With just a few dabs of colour in the right places she had become not only very much prettier, but, above all, far more feminine. Her short hair and boyish overalls merely added to the effect. As he took her in his arms a wave of synthetic violets flooded his nostrils. He remembered the half-darkness of a basement kitchen, and a woman's cavernous mouth. It was the very same scent that she had used; but at the moment it did not seem to matter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她肯定溜到工人生活区的一家商店，给自己买了一整套化妆品。她的嘴唇涂得很红，脸上搽了胭脂，鼻子上了粉；甚至还在眼眶下面描了什么东西，让眼睛看上去更明亮。妆化得不是很专业，但温斯顿这方面的要求也不是很高。他以前从来没有见过或想到一个女党员会在脸上化妆。她容貌的改观令人吃惊。只需恰到好处地化点妆，她不仅漂亮多了，而且重要的是，更有女人味了。她的短发和男式工作服更增强了这种效果。当他拥她入怀，一股合成紫罗兰香味钻进他的鼻孔。他记得那间幽暗的地下室厨房，一个女人黑洞洞的嘴。她用的是同一种香水，但眼下这无关紧要。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They flung their clothes off and climbed into the huge mahogany bed. It was the first time that he had stripped himself naked in her presence. Until now he had been too much ashamed of his pale and meagre body, with the varicose veins standing out on his calves and the discoloured patch over his ankle.

<div class="line_en">Presently they fell asleep for a little while. When Winston woke up the hands of the clock had crept round to nearly nine. He did not stir, because Julia was sleeping with her head in the crook of his arm. Most of her make-up had transferred itself to his own face or the bolster, but a light stain of rouge still brought out the beauty of her cheekbone. A yellow ray from the sinking sun fell across the foot of the bed and lighted up the fireplace, where the water in the pan was boiling fast. Down in the yard the woman had stopped singing, but the faint shouts of children floated in from the street. He wondered vaguely whether in the abolished past it had been a normal experience to lie in bed like this, in the cool of a summer evening, a man and a woman with no clothes on, making love when they chose, talking of what they chose, not feeling any compulsion to get up, simply lying there and listening to peaceful sounds outside. Surely there could never have been a time when that seemed ordinary? Julia woke up, rubbed her eyes, and raised herself on her elbow to look at the oilstove.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="后来他们睡着了一会儿。温斯顿醒来发现时间差不多到九点了。他没起身，因为朱丽亚还睡着，头枕在他的臂弯里。她的妆大多蹭到他的脸上或枕头上了，但淡淡的粉仍勾勒出颧骨的美丽。一道落日的淡黄色光线照到了床脚，壁炉那儿亮堂起来，锅里的水马上就要开了。院子里，那个女人不再唱歌，但街上孩子的喊声隐隐传来。他有点好奇，在消失了的过去，这是否是一种日常生活：这样躺在床上，在一个凉爽的夏日夜晚，一个男人和一个女人赤裸着身体，只要愿意就做爱，天南海北地闲聊，没有人强迫你起床，只是躺着，听着外面祥和的声音。肯定没有平淡生活的时候吗？从来都没有吗？朱丽亚醒了，揉揉眼睛，撑起身来看煤油炉子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's sure to be full of bugs, but who cares?" said Julia. One never saw a double bed nowadays, except in the homes of the proles. Winston had occasionally slept in one in his boyhood: Julia had never been in one before, so far as she could remember.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“床上肯定有很多臭虫，但谁在乎呢？”朱丽亚说。现在很难看到双人床了，除了在无产者家里。温斯顿小时候偶尔在双人床上睡过；而朱丽亚在她的记忆中从来没有上过双人床呢。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She pressed herself against him and wound her limbs round him, as though to reassure him with the warmth of her body. He did not reopen his eyes immediately. For several moments he had had the feeling of being back in a nightmare which had recurred from time to time throughout his life. It was always very much the same. He was standing in front of a wall of darkness, and on the other side of it there was something unendurable, something too dreadful to be faced. In the dream his deepest feeling was always one of self-deception, because he did in fact know what was behind the wall of darkness. With a deadly effort, like wrenching a piece out of his own brain, he could even have dragged the thing into the open. He always woke up without discovering what it was: but somehow it was connected with what Julia had been saying when he cut her short.</div>

<div class="line_en">Already the black instant of panic was half-forgotten. Feeling slightly ashamed of himself, he sat up against the bedhead. Julia got out of bed, pulled on her overalls, and made the coffee. The smell that rose from the saucepan was so powerful and exciting that they shut the window lest anybody outside should notice it and become inquisitive. What was even better than the taste of the coffee was the silky texture given to it by the sugar, a thing Winston had almost forgotten after years of saccharine. With one hand in her pocket and a piece of bread and jam in the other, Julia wandered about the room, glancing indifferently at the bookcase, pointing out the best way of repairing the gateleg table, plumping herself down in the ragged arm-chair to see if it was comfortable, and examining the absurd twelve-hour clock with a sort of tolerant amusement. She brought the glass paperweight over to the bed to have a look at it in a better light. He took it out of her hand, fascinated, as always, by the soft, rainwatery appearance of the glass.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="黑暗中的瞬间恐慌已经慢慢消失。他对自己感到有点不好意思，便坐直了靠着床头。朱丽亚下了床，穿上衣服，去煮咖啡。从锅里散发出的味道很强烈，也让人兴奋，他们把窗户关上，以免有人有所察觉。比咖啡的味道更好的是加了糖之后柔滑的质感，用了多年的糖精片，温斯顿几乎忘了还有糖这样的东西。朱丽亚一只手插在口袋，另一只手拿着一片面包和果酱，她在室内溜达，兴趣不大地看了一眼书架，指出修理折叠桌的最好方法，一屁股坐在扶手椅上，试一下是否舒适，以一种不予计较的娱乐态度查看那个奇特的有着十二小时钟面的台钟。她把那个玻璃镇纸拿到床上，放到亮光里仔细看。他从她手里拿过来，一如往常，为这块玻璃柔和的、雨水一般的外观所吸引。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Winston did not get up for a few minutes more. The room was darkening. He turned over towards the light and lay gazing into the glass paperweight. The inexhaustibly interesting thing was not the fragment of coral but the interior of the glass itself. There was such a depth of it, and yet it was almost as transparent as air. It was as though the surface of the glass had been the arch of the sky, enclosing a tiny world with its atmosphere complete. He had the feeling that he could get inside it, and that in fact he was inside it, along with the mahogany bed and the gateleg table, and the clock and the steel engraving and the paperweight itself. The paperweight was the room he was in, and the coral was Julia's life and his own, fixed in a sort of eternity at the heart of the crystal.</div>
