<div class="line_en">Jan Rodricks, though he seldom appreciated his luck, would have been even more discontented in an earlier age. A century before, his colour would have been a tremendous, perhaps an overwhelming, handicap. Today, it meant nothing. The inevitable reaction that had given early twenty-first-century negroes a slight sense of superiority had already passed away.</div>

<div class="line_en">Jan's father had been a charming but somewhat feckless Scot who had made a considerable name for himself as a professional magician. His death at the early age of forty-five had been aggravated by the excessive consumption of his country's most famous product.

<div class="line_en">No utopia can ever give satisfaction to everyone, all the time.

<div class="line_en">At twenty-seven, Jan still had several years of college life ahead of him before he needed to think seriously about his career. He had taken his bachelors' degrees without any difficulty, following a syllabus that would have seemed very strange a century before. His main subjects had been mathematics and physics, but as subsidiaries he had taken philosophy and musical appreciation. Even by the high standards of the time he was a first-rate amateur pianist.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mrs. Rodricks, still very much alive, lectured in advanced probability theory at Edinburgh University. It was typical of the extreme mobility of twenty-first-century Man that Mrs. Rodricks, who was coal black, had been born in Scotland, whereas her expatriate and blond husband had spent almost all his life in Haiti. Maia and Jan had never had a single home, but had oscillated between their parents' families like two small shuttlecocks. The treatment had been good fun, but had not helped to correct the instability they had both inherited from their father.</div>

<div class="line_en">In three years he would take his doctorate in engineering physics, with astronomy as a second subject. This would involve fairly hard work, but Jan rather welcomed that. He was studying at what was perhaps the most beautifully situated place of higher education in the world -- the University of Cape Town, nestling at the foot of Table Mountain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="三年之后，他将获得博士学位，主修工程物理学，辅修天文学，当然这得非常努力才行。他当时就读于世界上地理位置最优美的高等教育机构——坐落在桌山脚下的开普敦大学。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For Jan was still suffering from the romantic illusion -- the cause of so much misery and so much poetry -- that every man has only one real love in his life. At an unusually late age, be had lost his heart for the first time, to a lady more renowned for beauty than constancy. Rosita Tsien claimed, with perfect truth, to have the blood of Manchu emperors flowing in her veins. She still possessed many subjects, including most of the Faculty of Science at Cape. Jan had been taken prisoner by her delicate, flower-like beauty, and the affair had proceeded far enough to make its termination all the more galling. He could not imagine what had gone wrong…</div>

<div class="line_en">His other grievance was less easily remedied, for it concerned the impact of the Overlords upon his own ambitions. Jan was a romantic not only in heart but in mind. Like so many other young men since the conquest of the air had been assured, he had let his dreams and his imagination roam the unexplored seas of space.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="还有一块心病就更不容易解决了。扬不仅感情上浪漫，思想上也是如此，自从太空被证实是能够征服的以来，他就梦想着到从来没有人去过的太空深处去，但那在外星人的掌握之下。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He would get over it, of course. Other men had survived similar catastrophes without irreparable damage, had even reached the stage when they could say, "I'm sure I could never have been really serious about a woman like that!" But such detachment still lay far in the future, and at the moment Jan was very much at odds with life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最终，他会调整过来的，其他人也经历过类似的痛苦，也没见得造成终身伤害，有些人还能超脱到说这样的话，“我敢肯定当时我对她这样的人没有动过真感情！”要想扬有这样超然的态度，还为时太早，至少近期不可能现在，他时时感到生活不顺心。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A century before, Man had set foot upon the ladder that could lead him to the stars. At that very moment -- could it have been coincidence? -- the door to the planets had been slammed in his face. The Overlords had imposed few positive bans on any form of human activity (the conduct of war was perhaps the major exception), but research into space flight had virtually ceased. The challenge presented by the science of the Overlords was too great. For the moment, at least, Man had lost heart and had turned to other fields of activity. There was no point in developing rockets when the Overlords had Infinitely superior means of propulsion, based on principles of which they had never given any hint. A few hundred men had visited the moon, for the purpose of establishing a lunar observatory. They had travelled as passengers in a small vessel loaned by the Overlords -- and driven by rockets. It was obvious that little could be learned from a study of this primitive vehicle, even if its owners handed it over without reservation to inquisitive terrestrial scientists.</div>

<div class="line_en">The rising moon was beginning to paint the eastern sky with. a pale milky glow. Up there, Jan knew, was the main base of the Overlords, lying within the ramparts of Pluto. Though the supply ships must have been coming and going for more than seventy years, it was only in Jan's lifetime that all concealment had been dropped and they had made their departure in clear sight of Earth. In the two-hundred-inch telescope, the shadows of the great ships could be clearly seen when the morning or evening sun cast them for miles across the lunar plains. Since everything that the Overlords did was of immense interest to mankind, a careful watch was kept of their comings and goings, and the pattern of their behaviour (though not the reason for it) was beginning to emerge. One of those great shadows had vanished a few hours ago. That meant, Jan knew, that somewhere off the moon an Overlord ship was lying in space, carrying out whatever routine was necessary before it began its journey to its distant, unknown home.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="月亮正在冉冉升起，淡淡的月光照亮了东边的天空。扬知道，外星人在冥王星的某颗卫星上有一个重要基地。过去七十多年，外星人刻意把这一切都隐藏起来，人们能够看到运输船从那里启程离开还是最近的事。清晨和傍晚时分，透过二百英寸口径的望远镜可以清楚地看到阳光把基地上那些飞船的影子拉得有好几英里长，一直投到月球表面的平原上。人们对外星人做的所有事都怀着浓厚的兴趣，虽然不能解释为什么，但通过仔细观察也逐渐找到了一些规律。几个小时前，一艘飞船的影子消失了，说明它已经升上太空，正做着各类常规准备，很快就要踏上回家的漫漫旅程。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He was half-way through it when, half a million kilometres away, the stardrive went on. Up from the heart of the spreading moon-glow a tiny spark began to climb towards the zenith.</div>

<div class="line_en">At first its movement was so slow that it could hardly be perceived, but second by second it was gaining speed. As it climbed it increased in brilliance, then suddenly faded from sight. A moment later it had reappeared, gaining speed and brightness. Waxing and waning with a peculiar rhythm, it ascended ever more swiftly into the sky, drawing a fluctuating line of light across the stars. Even if one did not know its real distance, the impression of speed was breathtaking: when one knew that the departing ship was somewhere beyond the moon, the mind reeled at the speeds and energies involved.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="起初，那亮点走得很慢，几乎无法察觉，时间一秒秒过去，它的速度越来越快，随着高度的增加，亮度也越来越强，突然它消失了，片刻工夫又出现了，速度更快，亮度更强，就这样一会儿强一会儿弱地交替着，它的速度不断加快，在星座间划过一道摇曳的亮光，即使无法知道它的确切位置，速度也同样惊人。想到那艘飞船已经在月球以外的太空了，扬不禁想这需要怎样的速度和能量呢。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He had never seen one of those returning ships launch itself towards the stars. If conditions were good the sight was visible over half the world, but Jan had always been unlucky. One could never tell exactly when the take-off would be -- and the Overlords did not advertise the fact. He decided he would wait another ten minutes, then rejoin the party.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was an unimportant by-product of those energies, Jan knew, that he was seeing now. The ship itself was invisible, already far ahead of that ascending light. As a high-flying jet may leave a vapour trail behind it, so the outward-bound vessel of the Overlords left its own peculiar wake. The generally accepted theory -- and there seemed little doubt of its truth -- was that the immense accelerations of the stardrive caused a local distortion of space. What Jan was seeing, he knew, was nothing less than the light of distant stars, collected and focused into his eye wherever conditions were favourable along the track of the ship. It was a visible proof of relativity -- the bending of light in the presence of a colossal gravitational field.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="扬知道这道光影不过是那些能量的间接体现，飞船本身早就看不见了，早到光影前面老远老远的地方去了。就像普通飞机飞过留下一条长长的尾巴一样，外星人的飞船也同样会留下它的痕迹。飞船的剧烈加速会使空气发生位置改变，那道光影就是在观测条件好的情况下星光映入眼中的结果，一个巨大磁场中光线的折射现象。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now the end of that vast, pencil-shaped lens seemed to be moving more slowly, but that was only due to perspective. In reality the ship was still gaining speed; its path was merely being foreshortened as it hurled itself outwards to the stars. There would be many telescopes following it, Jan knew, as Earth's scientists tried to uncover the secrets of the Drive. Dozens of papers had already been published on the subject; no doubt the Overlords had read them with the greatest interest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在，那道形如铅笔的光影末端的速度似乎放慢了，但那只是视角的原因。事实上，飞船继续在加速，只是根据透视原理，它往太空外飞去时，路线几乎和地球垂直，因而距离似乎变短了。此时一定有无数的望远镜在跟踪它，科学家们都希望能有新的发现。几十种报纸曾刊载过类似的报道，外星人一定也兴致勃勃地读过了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The phantom light was beginning to wane. Now it was a fading streak, pointing to the heart of the constellation Carina, as Jan had known that it would.

It had a flat plastic top which he lifted off to reveal a glittering sea of closely packed ball-bearings.

<div class="line_en">Everyone had now taken up their positions. Going in a clockwise direction round the table were Rupert, Maia, Jan, Jean, George, and Benny Shoenberger. Ruth Shoenberger was sitting outside the circle with a notebook. She apparently had some objection to taking part in the proceedings, which had caused Benny to snake obscurely sarcastic remarks about people who still took the Talmud seriously. However, she seemed perfectly willing to act as a recorder.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Now listen," began Rupert, "for the benefit of sceptics like George, let's get this straight. Whether or not there's anything supernormal about this, it works. Personally, I think there's a purely mechanical explanation. When we put our hands on the disc, even though we may try to avoid influencing its movements, our subconscious starts playing tricks. I've analyzed lots of these seances, and I've never got answers that someone in the group mightn't have known or guessed -- though sometimes they weren't aware of the fact. However, I'd like to carry out the experiment in these rather -- ah -- peculiar circumstances."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“听着，”鲁柏特说，“既然有乔治这样的怀疑论者在场，我们就说得更直接一点，不管有没有超自然力量，这个碟子的确自己会动。我个人以为这是个简单的机械原理，当我们把手放到碟子上时，尽管我们想着尽量不去影响它的运动，但我们的潜意识却在起作用。我分析过很多类似情形，发现人们得到的答案总是一群人中已经有人知道或者猜到的，虽然他们自己没有意识到。现在，我想在这个很——特殊的场合再做做这个实验。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Peculiar Circumstance sat watching them silently, but doubtless not with indifference. George wondered just what Rashaverak thought of these antics. Were his reactions those of an anthropologist watching some primitive religious rite? The whole set-up was really quite fantastic, and George felt as big a fool as he had ever done in his life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那个所谓的“特殊场合”正坐在旁边兴致勃勃地观看着。乔治不禁想他会怎样看待这种古怪行径呢？是否觉得像一个考古学家在观察某种原始宗教仪式呢？整个事情真是异想天开，自己就像个傻瓜。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The plate was moving. It began to swing in a wide arc between the cards labelled "YES" and "NO". With some difficulty, George suppressed a giggle. Just what would it prove, he wondered, if the answer was "NO"? He remembered the old joke: "There's nobody here but us chickens, Massa…"</div>

<div class="line_en">Curiously enough, the very triviality of the phenomenon was beginning to impress George. He was sure that there was no supernormal explanation; as Rupert had said, the plate was simply responding to their unconscious muscular movements. But this fact in itself was surprising and impressive: he would never have believed that such precise, swift replies could have been obtained. Once he tried to see if he could influence the board by making it spell out his own name. He got the "G", but that was all: the rest was nonsense. It was virtually impossible, he decided, for one person to take control without the remainder of the circle knowing it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="碟子的移动只是人们无意识的肌肉运动的结果，乔治相信鲁柏特的话，但他没想到的是答案竟如此准确神速。他试着悄悄影响其他人拼出自己的名字，可刚刚拼了一个“乔”字，碟子就不听使唤了，拼出来的东西毫无意义。由此，他断定一个人在没有其他人知道自己想法的情况下，无法控制碟子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After half an hour, Ruth had taken down more than a dozen messages, some of them quite long ones. There were occasional spelling mistakes and curiosities of grammar, but they were few. Whatever the explanation, George was now convinced that he was not contributing consciously to the results. Several times, as a word was being spelt out, he had anticipated the next letter and hence the meaning of the message. And on each occasion the plate had gone in a quite unexpected direction and spelt something totally different. Sometimes, indeed -- since there was no pause to indicate the end of one word and the beginning of the next -- the entire message was meaningless until it was complete and Ruth had read it back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="半小时过去了，露丝记下了十多个问题和答案，有的答案很长，其中偶尔还有些拼写错误和古怪的语祛，但总的来说很少。乔治现在开始相信了，不管怎样解释，他不是在有意识地影响结果。有好几次，在碟子拼写单词的过程中，他就想下一个会是什么字母、什么意思，但每次碟子都移向截然不同的方向，拼出截然不同的答案。有时，一个词的词尾和下一个词的开头之间没有停顿，整个答案要等到全部拼完，露丝念出来才能明白意思。">查看中文翻译</div>
