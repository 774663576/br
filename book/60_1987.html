<div class="line_en">Franz and Simon are the dreamers of this novel. Unlike Franz, Simon never liked his mother. From childhood he searched for his father. He was willing to believe his father the victim of some sort of injustice that predated and explained the injustice his father had perpetrated on him. He never felt angry with his father, because he did not wish to ally himself with his mother, who continually maligned the man.</div>

<div class="line_en">He lived with her until he was eighteen and had finished secondary school; then he went off to Prague and the university. By that time Tomas was washing windows. Often Simon would wait long hours to arrange an accidental encounter with Tomas. But Tomas never stopped to talk to him.</div>

<div class="line_en">The only reason he became involved with the big-chinned former editor was that the editor's fate reminded him of his father's. The editor had never heard of Tomas. The Oedipus article had been forgotten. It was Simon who told him about it and asked him to persuade Tomas to sign the petition. The only reason the editor agreed was that he wanted to do something nice for the boy, whom he liked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他之所以跟那位长着尖下巴的记者结交，只是因为这位记者使他想起了父亲的命运。记者没听说过托马斯这个名字。关于俄狄浦斯的那篇文章早就忘了，还是西蒙求他跟自己一起去见托马斯，劝托马斯在请愿书上签名，他才知道有托马斯这个人的存在。记者很喜欢这个年轻人，为了让他高兴，也才同意陪他一起去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At about that time, he learned about a woman who had once been his father's mistress and was living in France. He found out her address. Because he desperately needed an imaginary eye to follow his life, he would occasionally write her long letters.</div>

<div class="line_en">During approximately his third year in the country, he received a letter from Tomas asking him to come and visit. Their meeting was a friendly one. Simon felt relaxed and did not stammer a bit. He probably did not realize that they did not understand each other very well. About four months later, he received a telegram saying that Tomas and his wife had been crushed to death under a truck.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="收到托马斯请他到家里去的信时，他在乡下已经住了两年多。父子相见是亲切的，西蒙感到很自在，一点也不结巴了。他也许没有发觉他们彼此还没有多少了解。大约在四个月以后，他收到一份电报。托马斯跟他妻子一起被轧死在一辆卡车下。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Whenever Simon thought back to the day when they had met, he was ashamed of his stage fright. His father couldn't have liked him. He, on the other hand, liked his father. He remembered his every word, and as time went on he saw how true they were. The words that made the biggest impression on him were Punishing people who don't know what they've done is barbaric. When his girlfriend's uncle put a Bible in his hands, he was particularly struck by Jesus' words Forgive them, for they know not what they do. He knew that his father was a nonbeliever, but in the similarity of the two phrases he saw a secret sign: his father agreed with the path he had taken.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="每当西蒙想起这次碰面，都为自己的怯懦而羞愧。他当时肯定让父亲不高兴了。相反，父亲让他很高兴。他清楚地记得父亲的每句话，且越来越觉得父亲在理。有一句话尤其深刻地印在了他的记忆中：“惩罚一个不知道自己做了什么的人，是野蛮的行径。”女朋友的叔叔曾亲手把一本圣经放到他手上，耶稣的话给了他强烈的震动：“原谅他们吧，因为他们不知道自己在做什么。”他知道父亲是不信神的，但这两句话的相似对他而言是一个隐秘的征兆：父亲赞同他选择的路。">查看中文翻译</div>
