<div class="line_en">How long can we keep this alliance? I don't think anyone expected the number of tributes to drop so quickly. What if I am wrong about the others protecting Peeta? If things were simply coincidental, or it's all been a strategy to win our trust to make us easy prey, or I don't understand what's actually going on? Wait, there's no ifs about that. I don't understand what's going on. And if I don't, it's time for Peeta and me to clear out of here.</div>

<div class="line_en">When I wake, I have a brief, delicious feeling of happiness that is somehow connected with Peeta. Happiness, of course, is a complete absurdity at this point, since at the rate things are going, I'll be dead in a day. And that's the best-case scenario, if I'm able to eliminate the rest of the field, including myself, and get Peeta crowned as the winner of the Quarter Quell. Still, the sensation's so unexpected and sweet I cling to it, if only for a few moments. Before the gritty sand, the hot sun, and my itching skin demand a return to reality.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我醒来时，心里有种虽然短暂，但却幸福甜蜜的感觉，这里有皮塔的缘由。当然，幸福，在这个时刻，是个很可笑的词。按照现在的设想，我一天以后就会死去。如果到那时我能消灭竞技场里所有的敌人，包括我自己在内，让皮塔戴上世纪极限赛的桂冠，那将是最理想的结局。可不管怎样，这种幸福感是那么出人意料、那么甜蜜，哪怕只有一会儿，我也愿意在粗糙的沙地、炎热的阳光、瘙痒的皮肤把我唤醒到现实世界之前，把它留住。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Everyone's already up and watching the descent of a parachute to the beach. I join them for another delivery of bread. It's identical to the one we received the night before. Twenty-four rolls from District 3. That gives us thirty-three in all. We each take five, leaving eight in reserve. No one says it, but eight will divide up perfectly after the next death. Somehow, in the light of day, joking about who will be around to eat the rolls has lost its humor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大家都醒了，这时一只降落伞落在沙滩上。我跑过去看，又送来了面包卷，和头天晚上我们收到的一样。三区送来的二十四个面包卷。这样，我们总共还有三十三个。我们每人拿五个，留下八个备用。没有人提起这事，可是在下一个人故去时，八个分起来正好不多不少。可是，大白天的，开玩笑说谁会活下来吃剩下的面包卷，也没什么好笑的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I sit next to Peeta on the sand to eat my rolls. For some reason, it's difficult to look at him. Maybe it was all that kissing last night, although the two of us kissing isn't anything new. It might not even have felt any different for him. Maybe it's knowing the brief amount of time we have left. And how we're working at such cross-purposes when it comes to who should survive these Games.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在沙滩上，我坐在皮塔的身边，吃着面包卷。不知怎的，我不敢正视他。也许是因为昨晚温情的吻—尽管我们亲吻也不是第一次了，他似乎并没感到与平时有任何的不同；也许是因为我心中很清楚我们在一起的时日无多，我们两个抱有的共同目的都是为了让对方活下去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After we eat, I take his hand and tug him toward the water. "Come on. I'll teach you how to swim." I need to get him away from the others where we can discuss breaking away. It will be tricky, because once they realize we're severing the alliance, we'll be instant targets.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们吃完之后，我拉着他到水边。“走吧，我教你游泳。”我需要把他叫到一旁，好商量与其他人脱离的事。这一定要做得人鬼不知，不然一旦大家知道我们要与他们脱离，我们就立刻会成为所有人的目标。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">If I was really teaching him to swim, I'd make him take off the belt since it keeps him afloat, but what does it matter now? So I just show him the basic stroke and let him practice going back and forth in waist-high water. At first, I notice Johanna keeping a careful eye on us, but eventually she loses interest and goes to take a nap. Finnick's weaving a new net out of vines and Beetee plays with his wire. I know the time has come.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果我真的是教他游泳，就得把有浮力的皮带摘掉，可现在这又有什么关系呢？所以，我只教他基本动作，然后让他在齐腰深的地方来回游。一开始，我注意到约翰娜在小心地观察我们，但最后，她没了兴趣，到一旁打盹去了。芬尼克正在用藤条编鱼网，比特在鼓捣金属线。我知道现在时间到了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">While Peeta has been swimming, I've discovered something. My remaining scabs are starting to peel off. By gently rubbing a handful of sand up and down my arm, I clean off the rest of the scales, revealing fresh new skin underneath. I stop Peeta's practice, on the pretext of showing him how to rid himself of the itchy scabs, and as we scrub ourselves, I bring up our escape.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="皮塔游泳的时候，我发现身上结的痂都翘皮了，我抓一把沙子在胳膊上下轻轻揉搓，痂就可以搓掉，我把所有的痂都搓掉，露出了里面的嫩肉。我赶紧叫皮塔不要游泳了，假装教他怎样弄掉发痒的硬痂。我们一边搓硬痂，一边秘密商量着脱离同盟的事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Peeta nods, and I can see him considering my proposition. Weighing if the odds will be in our favor. "Tell you what," he says. "Let's stick around until Brutus and Enobaria are dead. I think Beetee's trying to put together some kind of trap for them now. Then, I promise, we'll go."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="皮塔点点头，看得出他正在考虑我的建议，在心里掂量着这么做对我们是否有利。“依我看，咱们再等等，等把布鲁托和伊诺贝丽结果了再说。我猜比特正研究着捕获他们的圈套，到那时，咱们再走。”他说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Look, the pool is down to eight. I think it's time we took off," I say under my breath, although I doubt any of the tributes can hear me.</div>

<div class="line_en">I'm not entirely convinced. But if we leave now, we'll have two sets of adversaries after us. Maybe three, because who knows what Chaff's up to? Plus the clock to contend with. And then there's Beetee to think of. Johanna only brought him for me, and if we leave she'll surely kill him. Then I remember. I can't protect Beetee, too. There can only be one victor and it has to be Peeta. I must accept this. I must make decisions based on his survival only.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我觉得他的决定不太妥当。可反过来讲，如果我们现在离开，就会有两拨人要追杀我们，也许三拨，谁知道查夫处于什么状态；再说还要考虑躲避竞技场内的种种危险，再者，还要考虑比特。约翰娜把他带给了我，要是我们离开，她肯定就会杀了他。这时我才想起，我也保护不了比特。因为比赛只能有一个胜利者，而这人必须是皮塔。我必须要接受这个现实，我只能根据皮塔生存的需要去作出决定。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Beetee calls us over, and it turns out that during all those hours of fiddling with wire, he has indeed come up with a plan. "I think we'll all agree our next job is to kill Brutus and Enobaria," he says mildly. "I doubt they'll attack us openly again, now that they're so outnumbered. We could track them down, I suppose, but it's dangerous, exhausting work."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="比特叫我们都过去，原来他一直鼓捣金属线是有道理的，他制定了一个计划。“我想大家都同意我们下一步的计划是杀死布鲁托和伊诺贝丽吧，”他不慌不忙地说，“我想他们应该不会再公开地袭击我们了，因为他们的人数比我们少。我们应该追踪他们，可那又危险，又累。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The three of us scour all the scabs from our bodies, helping with the others' backs, and come out the same pink as the sky. We apply another round of medicine because the skin seems too delicate for the sunlight, but it doesn't look half as bad on smooth skin and will be good camouflage in the jungle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们三个把身上结的痂都擦掉了，又互相帮忙把背上的也擦掉，我们的身上的皮肤跟粉色的天空一样鲜嫩。接着又擦了些药膏，防止鲜嫩的皮肤被晒伤，药膏抹在平滑的皮肤上也并不难看，再说，这颜色在丛林中还是保护色呢。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Do you think they've figured out about the clock?" I ask.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你觉得他们已经琢磨出来大钟的道理了吗？”我问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"If they haven't, they'll figure it out soon enough. Perhaps not as specifically as we have. But they must know that at least some of the zones are wired for attacks and that they're reoccurring in a circular fashion. Also, the fact that our last fight was cut off by Gamemaker intervention will not have gone unnoticed by them. We know it was an attempt to disorient us, but they must be asking themselves why it was done, and this, too, may lead them to the realization that the arena's a clock," says Beetee. "So I think our best bet will be setting our own trap."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“就算没有，他们很快也会想出来。也许不像我们这么精确，但他们至少明白不同的区域会发动不同的袭击，而且是以循环的方式进行。上次的交手被极限赛组织者有意干预，他们也不可能没注意到。极限赛组织者是想让我们失去方向感，他们肯定也会问自己同样的问题，这样，也会使他们很快明白竞技场是个大钟的事实。所以，我想我们最好的办法就是设计圈套。”比特说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"All right," I say. "We'll stay until the Careers are dead. But that's the end of it."</div>

<div class="line_en">"If you were Brutus and Enobaria, knowing what you do now about the jungle, where would you feel safest?" Beetee asks. There's nothing patronizing in his voice, and yet I can't help thinking he reminds me of a schoolteacher about to ease children into a lesson. Perhaps it's the age difference, or simply that Beetee is probably about a million times smarter than the rest of us.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“如果你是布鲁托和伊诺贝丽，了解丛林里的情况之后，你会觉得哪里最安全？”比特问。尽管他说话的语气并没有高高在上的感觉，然而我还是觉得他很像一个在学校里给孩子们上课的老师。之所以有这样的感觉，也许因为他长我们许多，也许是因为他确实要比我们聪明一百倍吧。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When she's joined us, Beetee shoos us all back a bit so he can have room to work in the sand. He swiftly draws a circle and divides it into twelve wedges.

<div class="line_cn" title="约翰娜一会儿被叫了过来，然后比特让我们大家都略微后退一些，腾出地方让他在沙地上画示意图。他在地上画了一个圆圈，分成十二个等份，这是竞技场。他画得不像皮塔那么仔细，而是大致画了一下，因为他脑子里想的是更复杂的问题。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes. So what I'm suggesting is that after the bolt hits at noon, but before it hits at midnight, we run my wire from that tree all the way down into the saltwater, which is, of course, highly conductive. When the bolt strikes, the electricity will travel down the wire and into not only the water but also the surrounding beach, which will still be damp from the ten o'clock wave. Anyone in contact with those surfaces at that moment will be electrocuted," says Beetee.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，所以，我建议，当中午闪电过后，晚上闪电到来之前，我们把金属线跟山上的大树连接上，然后一直引到山下的咸水里，当然，咸水的导电性是很强的。当闪电击中大树时，电流会顺着金属线向下传导，一直传导到唯一的水域，当然，还会传导到周围的沙滩，正好，沙滩因为十点的巨浪刚过也还是潮湿的。任何人只要这个时候接触沙滩，都会触电身亡。”比特说。">查看中文翻译</div>

I wish Haymitch would stop sending us that District 3 bread and get us some more of that District 4 stuff, because I've sweated out buckets in the last two days, and even though I've had the fish, I'm craving salt. A piece of ice would be another good idea. Or a cold drink of water.

<div class="line_en">Beetee wants to inspect the lightning tree before he has to rig it. Judging by the sun, it's about nine in the morning. We have to leave our beach soon, anyway. So we break camp, walk over to the beach that borders the lightning section, and head into the jungle. Beetee's still too weak to hike up the slope on his own, so Finnick and Peeta take turns carrying him. I let Johanna lead because it's a pretty straight shot up to the tree, and I figure she can't get us too lost. Besides, I can do a lot more damage with a sheath of arrows than she can with two axes, so I'm the best one to bring up the rear.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Only with the ear the Capitol reconstructed," I say. Guess who I'm not fooling with that story? Beetee. Because surely he remembers that he showed me how to spot a force field, and probably it's impossible to hear force fields, anyway. But, for whatever reason, he doesn't question my claim.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我只能用凯匹特修复的那只耳朵听到。”我说。猜猜这里只有谁我骗不了？比特。他肯定还记得曾经告诉过我怎么辨别电磁力场的位置。可是，不管出于什么原因，他并没有再问我。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The lightning tree's unmistakable as it towers so high above the others. I find a bunch of nuts and make everybody wait while I move slowly up the slope, tossing the nuts ahead of me. But I see the force field almost immediately, even before a nut hits it, because it's only about fifteen yards away. My eyes, which are sweeping the greenery before me, catch sight of the rippled square high up and to my right. I throw a nut directly in front of me and hear it sizzle in confirmation.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吸引闪电的那棵树是不会找错的，它巍然耸立，比别的树高出许多。我让其他人等在后面，我拿着挂着坚果的树枝，边往地上扔，边慢慢地往上走。可是我马上就发现了电磁力场，甚至在坚果还没碰到它之前，因为它离我只有十五码远。我用锐利的目光扫视前面的绿色植物，很快发现了在我的右上方有一个波动的方块。我把树枝扔到前面，立刻听到滋滋的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We divide up duties. Finnick guards Beetee while he examines the tree, Johanna taps for water, Peeta gathers nuts, and I hunt nearby. The tree rats don't seem to have any fear of humans, so I take down three easily. The sound of the ten o'clock wave reminds me I should get back, and I return to the others and clean my kill. Then I draw a line in the dirt a few feet from the force field as a reminder to keep back, and Peeta and I settle down to roast nuts and sear cubes of rat.</div>

<div class="line_en">Beetee is still messing around the tree, doing I don't know what, taking measurements and such. At one point he snaps off a sliver of bark, joins us, and throws it against the force field. It bounces back and lands on the ground, glowing. In a few moments it returns to its original color. "Well, that explains a lot," says Beetee. I look at Peeta and can't help biting my lip to keep from laughing since it explains absolutely nothing to anyone but Beetee.</div>

<div class="line_en">We don't go that far, though. Only to the identical tree in the blood-rain section. We have a picnic of sorts, squatting on the ground, eating our jungle food, waiting for the bolt that signals noon. At Beetee's request, I climb up into the canopy as the clicking begins to fade out. When the lightning strikes, it's dazzling, even from here, even in this bright sunlight. It completely encompasses the distant tree, making it glow a hot blue-white and causing the surrounding air to crackle with electricity. I swing down and report my findings to Beetee, who seems satisfied, even if I'm not terribly scientific.</div>

<div class="line_en">We take a circuitous route back to the ten o'clock beach. The sand is smooth and damp, swept clean by the recent wave. Beetee essentially gives us the afternoon off while he works with the wire. Since it's his weapon and the rest of us have to defer to his knowledge so entirely, there's the odd feeling of being let out of school early. At first we take turns having naps in the shadowy edge of the jungle, but by late afternoon everyone is awake and restless. We decide, since this might be our last chance for seafood, to make a sort of feast of it. Under Finnick's guidance we spear fish and gather shellfish, even dive for oysters. I like this last part best, not because I have any great appetite for oysters. I only ever tasted them once, in the Capitol, and I couldn't get around the sliminess. But it's lovely, deep down under the water, like being in a different world. The water's very clear, and schools of bright-hued fish and strange sea flowers decorate the sand floor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们从旁边的路又绕回到十点钟位置的沙滩上。沙子光滑潮湿，被刚刚经过的巨浪冲洗得干干净净。比特在忙着鼓弄金属线，我们就等于放了假。这是他的武器，我们完全仰仗他的知识，所以有种奇怪的感觉，好像现在他让我们早早放了学。起先，我们轮流在林子边的树荫里打盹，可是到了傍晚，每个人都睡醒了，闲着没事干。我们决定来顿海鲜大餐，这是最后的机会了。在芬尼克的指挥下，我们叉鱼，抓蛤蜊，甚至潜水去摸牡蛎。我最喜欢这最后一项，并不是因为我特别喜欢吃牡蛎。我只在凯匹特吃过一回，还受不了那滑溜溜的感觉。我只是喜欢潜到水下的感觉，好像到了另一个世界。那里的水特别清澈，各种色彩艳丽的鱼和奇异的水草装点着海底世界。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Johanna keeps watch while Finnick, Peeta, and I clean and lay out the seafood. Peeta's just pried open an oyster when I hear him give a laugh. "Hey, look at this!" He holds up a glistening, perfect pearl about the size of a pea. "You know, if you put enough pressure on coal it turns to pearls," he says earnestly to Finnick.</div>

<div class="line_en">"No, it doesn't," says Finnick dismissively. But I crack up, remembering that's how a clueless Effie Trinket presented us to the people of the Capitol last year, before anyone knew us. As coal pressured into pearls by our weighty existence. Beauty that arose out of pain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，不会的。”芬尼克不屑地说。可这话却把我逗笑了。我想起来艾菲·特琳奇去年就是这么没头没脑地把我们推介给凯匹特人的，那时还没有人认识我们。当煤炭被我们生存的重负压成珍珠时，那世上所有的美无疑也就来自痛苦了。">查看中文翻译</div>
