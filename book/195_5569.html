<div class="line_en">Cronshaw is in London and would be glad to see you. He is living at 43 Hyde Street, Soho. I don't know where it is, but I daresay you will be able to find out. Be a brick and look after him a bit. He is very down on his luck. He will tell you what he is doing. Things are going on here very much as usual. Nothing seems to have changed since you were here. Clutton is back, but he has become quite impossible. He has quarrelled with everybody. As far as I can make out he hasn't got a cent, he lives in a little studio right away beyond the Jardin des Plantes, but he won't let anybody see his work. He doesn't show anywhere, so one doesn't know what he is doing. He may be a genius, but on the other hand he may be off his head. By the way, I ran against Flanagan the other day. He was showing Mrs. Flanagan round the Quarter. He has chucked art and is now in popper's business. He seems to be rolling. Mrs. Flanagan is very pretty and I'm trying to work a portrait. How much would you ask if you were me? I don't want to frighten them, and then on the other hand I don't want to be such an ass as to ask L150 if they're quite willing to give L300.</div>

<div class="line_en">Of course I remember you very well. I have an idea that I had some part in rescuing you from the Slough of Despond in which myself am hopelessly immersed. I shall be glad to see you. I am a stranger in a strange city and I am buffeted by the philistines. It will be pleasant to talk of Paris. I do not ask you to come and see me, since my lodging is not of a magnificence fit for the reception of an eminent member of Monsieur Purgon's profession, but you will find me eating modestly any evening between seven and eight at a restaurant yclept Au Bon Plaisir in Dean Street.</div>

<div class="line_en">Philip went the day he received this letter. The restaurant, consisting of one small room, was of the poorest class, and Cronshaw seemed to be its only customer.

<div class="line_en">Cronshaw had before him a glass of absinthe. It was nearly three years since they had met, and Philip was shocked by the change in his appearance. He had been rather corpulent, but now he had a dried-up, yellow look: the skin of his neck was loose and winkled; his clothes hung about him as though they had been bought for someone else; and his collar, three or four sizes too large, added to the slatternliness of his appearance. His hands trembled continually. Philip remembered the handwriting which scrawled over the page with shapeless, haphazard letters. Cronshaw was evidently very ill.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克朗肖面前摆着杯苦艾酒。三年没见，他现在的样子惊得菲利普连连咋舌。过去胖乎乎的身材已经干巴巴地抽成一条，说是面黄肌瘦也不为过，脖子上的皮松垮垮，布满皱纹，衣服晃晃悠悠地挂在身上，像是偷了别人的。领子足足大了三四号，让他看上去显得更邋遢。他的手一个劲儿地颤个不停。菲利普想起他来信上的字迹，歪七扭八、奇形怪状的草草一片。无疑，克朗肖已经病入膏肓。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I eat little these days," he said. "I'm very sick in the morning. I'm just having some soup for my dinner, and then I shall have a bit of cheese."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这些天我几乎没怎么吃东西，”他说，“早上害恶心。中午只是喝点汤，然后吃一小片奶酪。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I eat here because I can be alone," he said. "They are not doing well; the only people who come are a few trollops and one or two waiters out of a job; they are giving up business, and the food is execrable. But the ruin of their fortunes is my advantage."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我在这儿吃饭是图个清静，”他说，“这里的东西烂透了；只有个把妓女和丢了工作的餐馆侍者才会到这来。他们也早就破罐子破摔，做的饭简直难以下咽。不过他们倒霉对我反倒挺有利的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Philip's glance unconsciously went to the absinthe, and Cronshaw, seeing it, gave him the quizzical look with which he reproved the admonitions of common sense.</div>

<div class="line_en">"What is London to me? I am a fish out of water. I walk through the crowded streets, men jostle me, and I seem to walk in a dead city. I felt that I couldn't die in Paris. I wanted to die among my own people. I don't know what hidden instinct drew me back at the last."</div>

<div class="line_en">He looked at Philip in the way which had formerly had the power of making him feel incredibly narrow. It seemed to point out that what he was thinking was distressingly obvious; and when you have agreed with the obvious what more is there to say? Philip changed the topic.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克朗肖看着菲利普，那个熟悉的眼神曾一度让菲利普觉得偏激狭隘得难以置信。好像在对他说：你心里在想些什么我一清二楚，弄得我也心里犯堵。既然彼此心照不宣，何必还要开口呢？菲利普赶快换了下一话题。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Philip knew of the woman Cronshaw had lived with and the two draggle-tailed children, but Cronshaw had never mentioned them to him, and he did not like to speak of them. He wondered what had happened to them.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Because I don't choose. It doesn't matter what a man does if he's ready to take the consequences. Well, I'm ready to take the consequences. You talk glibly of giving up drinking, but it's the only thing I've got left now. What do you think life would be to me without it? Can you understand the happiness I get out of my absinthe? I yearn for it; and when I drink it I savour every drop, and afterwards I feel my soul swimming in ineffable happiness. It disgusts you. You are a puritan and in your heart you despise sensual pleasures. Sensual pleasures are the most violent and the most exquisite. I am a man blessed with vivid senses, and I have indulged them with all my soul. I have to pay the penalty now, and I am ready to pay."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“因为我不想戒。但凡有了承担一切后果的准备，那不管做什么又有何关系呢？我已经准备好了。你劝我戒酒，说得倒容易。可这是我现在唯一能干的事儿了，要是连酒都喝不成，我活着还有什么意思？你知道苦艾酒给我带来多少乐子吗？我想喝，想一滴滴地咂摸着喝，几杯下肚，我就神游仙境，不亦乐乎了。你看不起喝酒这件事。你是个清教徒一样的人，打心底地厌恶肉体的愉悦。可这种愉悦来得最猛烈、最细腻。所幸上天怜我，予我丰富而敏锐的官能，我才得以沉迷于享乐之中。现在要我为之付出代价，欠债还账，本就天经地义。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Sometimes, when I'm alone." He looked at Philip. "You think that's a condemnation? You're wrong. I'm not afraid of my fear. It's folly, the Christian argument that you should live always in view of your death. The only way to live is to forget that you're going to die. Death is unimportant. The fear of it should never influence a single action of the wise man. I know that I shall die struggling for breath, and I know that I shall be horribly afraid. I know that I shall not be able to keep myself from regretting bitterly the life that has brought me to such a pass; but I disown that regret. I now, weak, old, diseased, poor, dying, hold still my soul in my hands, and I regret nothing."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“有时候吧，我一个人的时候。”他看着菲利普，“你以为这是谴责吗？你错了。我不恐惧自己的恐惧，它本身就是件愚蠢的事。基督教徒说，人生在世，必须时时想到死。可想要活着，就得忘了自己必死的命运。死亡没什么大不了。智者不该因为害怕死亡，而改变自己的行为轨迹。我知道自己到死也会挣扎着想再喘口气，我会非常非常惊恐。也知道自己必定会后悔。想到这一生，想到最后落得这番境地，心里不能不苦涩。但我不承认自己的后悔。我现在啊，虚弱、衰老、又病又穷，马上就要死了。可灵魂还攥在手里呢，我什么也不后悔。”">查看中文翻译</div>
