<div class="line_en">She could feel the hole inside her every morning when she woke. It wasn't hunger, though sometimes there was that too. It was a hollow place, an emptiness where her heart had been, where her brothers had lived, and her parents. Her head hurt too. Not as bad as it had at first, but still pretty bad. Arya was used to that, though, and at least the lump was going down. But the hole inside her stayed the same. The hole will never feel any better, she told herself when she went to sleep.</div>

<div class="line_en">Some mornings Arya did not want to wake at all. She would huddle beneath her cloak with her eyes squeezed shut and try to will herself back to sleep. If the Hound would only have left her alone, she would have slept all day and all night.</div>

<div class="line_en">And dreamed. That was the best part, the dreaming. She dreamed of wolves most every night. A great pack of wolves, with her at the head. She was bigger than any of them, stronger, swifter, faster. She could outrun horses and outfight lions. When she bared her teeth even men would run from her, her belly was never empty long, and her fur kept her warm even when the wind was blowing cold. And her brothers and sisters were with her, many and more of them, fierce and terrible and hers. They would never leave her.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Hound no longer watched her as closely as he had. Sometimes he did not seem to care whether she stayed or went, and he no longer bound her up in a cloak at night. One night I'll kill him in his sleep, she told herself, but she never did. One day I'll ride away on Craven, and he won't be able to catch me, she thought, but she never did that either. Where would she go? Winterfell was gone. Her grandfather's brother was at Riverrun, but he didn't know her, no more than she knew him. Maybe Lady Smallwood would take her in at Acorn Hall, but maybe she wouldn't. Besides, Arya wasn't even sure she could find Acorn Hall again. Sometimes she thought she might go back to Shama's inn, if the floods hadn't washed it away. She could stay with Hot Pie, or maybe Lord Beric would find her there. Anguy would teach her to use a bow, and she could ride with Gendry and be an outlaw, like Wenda the White Fawn in the songs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="猎狗不再像以前那样看紧她，有时似乎并不在意她是走是留，晚上也不再把她捆进马褥子。我要趁睡熟时杀死他，她告诉自己，却从未付诸行动，我要骑着胆小鬼逃跑，他抓不住我，她心想，但也未付诸行动。该去哪儿？没有临冬城了，舅公在奔流城，可他们彼此不认识。橡果厅的斯莫伍德夫人或许会收留她，或许不会，况且艾莉亚甚至不肯定自己能找到橡果厅。有时她觉得该回沙玛的客栈——若洪水没将它冲走的话——跟热派做伴，搞不好贝里伯爵还能重新找到她。安盖会教她如何用弓，然后就可以同詹德利一起当土匪，像歌谣里的“白鹿”温妲那样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But if her nights were full of wolves, her days belonged to the dog. Sandor Clegane made her get up every morning, whether she wanted to or not. He would curse at her in his raspy voice, or yank her to her feet and shake her. Once he dumped a helm full of cold water all over her head. She bounced up sputtering and shivering and tried to kick him, but he only laughed. "Dry off and feed the bloody horses," he told her, and she did.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果说她的夜晚属于狼，白天则属于狗。桑铎·克里冈天天早上准时叫她起床，不管她喜不喜欢。他会用刺耳的声音咒骂她，或将她提起来摇晃。有回他把一盔冰水倒在她头上。她跳了起来，一边颤抖着洒水，一边想踢他，结果他只哈哈大笑。“擦干净，然后去喂该死的马。”他吩咐，而她乖乖照办。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They had two now, Stranger and a sorrel palfrey mare Arya had named Craven, because Sandor said she'd likely run off from the Twins the same as them. They'd found her wandering riderless through a field the morning after the slaughter. She was a good enough horse, but Arya could not love a coward. Stranger would have fought. Still, she tended the mare as best she knew. It was better than riding double with the Hound. And Craven might have been a coward, but she was young and strong as well. Arya thought that she might be able to outrun Stranger, if it came to it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们现在有了两匹马，陌客和一匹栗色矮母马，艾莉亚给它取名“胆小鬼”，因为桑铎说它很可能跟他们一样，是从孪河城逃出来的。屠杀发生后的第二天早上，他们在田野里遇见游荡着的它，背上没有骑手。作为坐骑，它很不赖，但艾莉亚无法喜爱胆小鬼。陌客就会反抗。但她还是尽力照料它，这总比跟猎狗同骑要强。况且胆小鬼虽然懦弱，但年轻力壮，艾莉亚觉得，如果情势危急，它会跑得比陌客快。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But that was just stupid, like something Sansa might dream. Hot Pie and Gendry had left her just as soon as they could, and Lord Beric and the outlaws only wanted to ransom her, just like the Hound. None of them wanted her around. They were never my pack, not even Hot Pie and Gendry. I was stupid to think so, just a stupid little girl, and no wolf a t all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但这都是笨念头，跟珊莎的梦想一样。热派和詹德利有机会就离开了她，而贝里伯爵的土匪与猎狗只想拿她换赎金。没人想跟她在一起。他们不与我同一族群，就连热派和詹德利也不是。我想那些真是太笨了，像个笨蛋小女孩。根本不是狼。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So she stayed with the Hound. They rode every day, never sleeping twice in the same place, avoiding towns and villages and castles as best they could. Once she asked Sandor Clegane where they were going. "Away," he said. "That's all you need to know. You're not worth spit to me now, and I don't want to hear your whining. I should have let you run into that bloody castle."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因此她留下来同猎狗结伴。他们每天骑马赶路，从不在同一地方睡两次，并尽量避开市镇、村庄和城堡。有次她问桑铎·克里冈，他们要上哪儿去。“去远方，”他说，“知道这点就行。我不想浪费口舌，也不想听你乱喊乱叫。妈的，真该让你跑进那座该死的城堡。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sometimes in their wanderings they glimpsed other people; farmers in their fields, swineherds with their pigs, a milkmaid leading a cow, a squire carrying a message down a rutted road. She never wanted to speak to them either. it was as if they lived in some distant land and spoke a queer alien tongue; they had nothing to do with her, or her with them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="再说，被人看到也不安全。时不时会有一队骑手经过蜿蜒的田间道路，高举佛雷家族的双塔旗帜。“他们在猎杀漏网的北方人，”对方经过时猎狗道，“听见马蹄声，赶紧低头，这里没有朋友。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That wasn't fair of him to say. Aside from that one time, Arya hardly talked at all. Whole days passed when neither of them said anything. She was too empty to talk, and the Hound was too angry. She could feel the fury in him; she could see it on his face, the way his mouth would tighten and twist, the looks he gave her. Whenever he took his axe to chop some wood for a fire, he would slide into a cold rage, hacking savagely at the tree or the deadfall or the broken limb, until they had twenty times as much kindling and firewood as they'd needed. Sometimes he would be so sore and tired afterward that he would lie down and go right to sleep without even lighting a fire. Arya hated it when that happened, and hated him too. Those were the nights when she stared the longest at the axe. It looks awfully heavy, but I bet I could swing it. She wouldn't hit him with the flat, either.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他这么说不公平。除了那一次，艾莉亚根本不说话。日子一天一天地过去，他俩什么也不说。她太过空洞，无话可说，猎狗则太愤怒。她可以感觉到他体内的怒火，从他脸上的表情、从他扭曲紧绷的嘴唇、从他瞧她的眼神，都看得出来。每当他拿斧劈柴，便会进入一种令人颤栗的愤怒状态，他会疯狂地劈砍树干、落木或者断枝——柴火根本不用劈那么细。在那之后，他往往精疲力竭，躺倒下去立刻睡着，连火都没生。艾莉亚憎恶这种情形，也憎恶他。那样的夜晚，她会长长久久地瞪着斧头。它看来十分沉重，但我打赌自己能挥动。而且不会用斧背砸他。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">One day, in an earthen hollow made by the roots of a fallen oak, they came face to face with another survivor of the Twins. The badge on his breast showed a pink maiden dancing in a swirl of silk, and he told them he was Ser Marq Piper's man; a bowman, though he'd lost his bow. His left shoulder was all twisted and swollen where it met his arm; a blow from a mace, he said, it had broken his shoulder and smashed his chainmail deep into his flesh. "A northman, it was," he wept. "His badge was a bloody man, and he saw mine and made a jape, red man and pink maiden, maybe they should get together. I drank to his Lord Bolton, he drank to Ser Marq, and we drank together to Lord Edmure and Lady Roslin and the King in the North. And then he killed me." His eyes were fever bright when he said that, and Arya could tell that it was true. His shoulder was swollen grotesquely, and pus and blood had stained his whole left side. There was a stink to him too. He smells like a corpse. The man begged them for a drink of wine.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有一天，在某个由倒下的橡树根构成的泥穴里，他们面对面遇上另一位孪河城事变的幸存者。他的纹章是一个披白丝带跳舞的粉红少女，自称替马柯·派柏爵士效劳，当弓箭手，虽然弓已经丢了。他左肩与手臂交界处扭曲肿胀，据说是钉头锤砸的，锤子打碎了肩膀，并使得锁甲深嵌入血肉之中。“北方佬干的，”他哭泣道，“胸口有小血人的北方佬。他看到我的徽纹，还开玩笑说，红色的男人和粉色的少女，应该凑成一对。我为他的波顿伯爵祝酒，他为马柯爵士祝酒，我们共同为艾德慕公爵、萝丝琳夫人及北境之王祝酒，然后他就要杀我。”说这番话时，他眼里满是炽热的光，艾莉亚看得出，那是真实情感的流露。他肩膀肿得出奇，整个左半身沾满脓血。一股恶臭的味道，闻起来就像尸体。那人恳求给他酒。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Besides, it wasn't safe to be seen. From time to time columns of horsemen passed down the winding farm roads, the twin towers of Frey flying before them.

He gulped it down as fast as she could pour, and what he couldn't gulp ran down his cheeks into the brown blood that crusted his whiskers, until pale pink tears dangled from his beard. When the water was gone he clutched the helm and licked the steel. "Good," he said. "I wish it was wine, though. I wanted wine."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="见她回来，弓箭手竭力抬脸，好让她把水倒进嘴巴。她倒得有多快，他就咽得有多快，咽不下去的流下脸颊，渗进棕色的血块，直到胡须里满是淡粉色水滴。水倒完后，他抓住头盔舔钢铁。“好爽，”他说，“酒就更好了。我想喝酒。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They had passed a small pond a short ways back. Sandor gave Arya his helm and told her to fill it, so she trudged back to the water's edge.

<div class="line_cn" title="他们刚在不远处经过一个小池塘。桑铎把头盔交给艾莉亚，让她跋涉回去装水。烂泥溅上靴子，她把猎狗的头盔当桶子，水从眼孔漏出，但底部仍储了许多。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There were two silver stags in the archer's purse, and almost thirty coppers. His dagger had a pretty pink stone in the hilt. The Hound hefted the knife in his hand, then flipped it toward Arya. She caught it by the hilt, slid it through her belt, and felt a little better. It wasn't Needle, but it was steel. The dead man had a quiver of arrows too, but arrows weren't much good without a bow. His boots were too big for Arya and too small for the Hound, so those they left. She took his kettle helm as well, even though it came down almost past her nose, so she had to tilt it back to see. "He must have had a horse as well, or he wouldn't have got away," Clegane said, peering about, "but it's bloody well gone, I'd say. No telling how long he's been here."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="弓箭手口袋里有两枚银鹿和近三十个铜板。他匕首柄上有颗漂亮的粉红宝石，猎狗将其掂了掂，然后扔给艾莉亚。她接住刀柄，插入皮带，感觉稍好了些。它虽不比“缝衣针”，终究是铁器，可以防身。死人还有一袋箭，但没弓的箭不管用。他的靴子对艾莉亚来说太大，对猎狗又太小，只好留下。她还拿了他的圆盔，尽管它盖到了她鼻子底，她得稍稍翘起来才能走路。“他一定有马，否则逃不掉，”克里冈边说边四处张望，“但我敢说，妈的早跑远了。没人知道他在这儿待了多久。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The crows were there too, screaming at the wolves and filling the air with feathers. Their blood was hotter, and one of her sisters had snapped at one as it took flight and caught it by the wing. It made her want a crow herself. She wanted to taste the blood, to hear the bones crunch between her teeth, to fill her belly with warm flesh instead of cold. She was hungry and the meat was all around, but she knew she could not eat.</div>

<div class="line_en">The scent was stronger now. She pricked her ears up and listened to the grumbles of her pack, the shriek of angry crows, the whirr of wings and sound of running water. Somewhere far off she could hear horses and the calls of living men, but they were not what mattered. Only the scent mattered. She sniffed the air again. There it was, and now she saw it too, something pale and white drifting down the river, turning where it brushed against a snag. The reeds bowed down before it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="气味更强烈了。她竖起耳朵，听狼群低吼，乌鸦怒叫，羽翼拍打，河水奔流。远方某处，传来马匹的声响和人类的呼叫，但那并不重要。气味才重要。她再度嗅闻空气。就在那儿，她看见了，苍白的物体顺流漂下，碰上什么东西转了个方向。芦苇在它面前弯腰。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She splashed noisily through the shallows and threw herself into the deeper water, her legs churning. The current was strong but she was stronger. She swam, following her nose. The river smells were rich and wet, but those were not the smells that pulled her. She paddled after the sharp red whisper of cold blood, the sweet cloying stench of death. She chased them as she had often chased a red deer through the trees, and in the end she ran them down, and her jaw closed around a pale white arm. She shook it to make it move, but there was only death and blood in her mouth. By now she was tiring, and it was all she could do to pull the body back to shore. As she dragged it up the muddy bank, one of her little brothers came prowling, his tongue lolling from his mouth. She had to snarl to drive him off, or else he would have fed. Only then did she stop to shake the water from her fur. The white thing lay facedown in the mud, her dead flesh wrinkled and pale, cold blood trickling from her throat. Rise, she thought. Rise and eat and run with us.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她穿过浅滩，溅起水花，发出嘈杂声响，扎入深处。腿脚搅动河水，水流强劲，但她更壮。她跟从鼻子的指引向前游去，水中的气味浓烈潮湿，但牵引她的不是这味道，而是一丝刺鼻的冰冷红血，一股郁郁作呕的死亡气息。她追逐它，就像平时在林间追逐红鹿。末了，她用牙齿逮到一条苍白的手臂，不断摇晃，想让它动起来，嘴里却只有血与死亡。她以疲倦的身躯，费尽全力将尸体拖回岸边，拽上泥泞的堤坝，一个小兄弟悄悄游荡过来，舌头耷拉在嘴角。她不得不龇牙咆哮，将他赶走，否则他便要进食了。此时她抖落毛皮上的水，那白色的物体脸朝下躺在泥地，死肉苍白生褶，冰冷的血从喉咙里渗出。起来，她心想，起来，跟我们一起进食，一起奔跑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The sound of horses turned her head. Men. They were coming from downwind, so she had not smelled them, but now they were almost here. Men on horses, with flapping black and yellow and pink wings and long shiny claws in hand. Some of her younger brothers bared their teeth to defend the food they'd found, but she snapped at them until they scattered. That was the way of the wild. Deer and hares and crows fled before wolves, and wolves fled from men. She abandoned the cold white prize in the mud where she had dragged it, and ran, and felt no shame.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was quiet in the village. They had beds stuffed with straw and not too many lice, the food was plain but filling, and the air smelled of pines. All the same, Arya soon decided that she hated it. The villagers were cowards. None of them would even look at the Hound's face, at least not for long. Some of the women tried to put her in a dress and make her do needlework, but they weren't Lady Smallwood and she was having none of it. And there was one girl who took to following her, the village elder's daughter. She was of an age with Arya, but just a child; she cried if she skinned a knee, and carried a stupid cloth doll with her everywhere she went. The doll was made up to look like a man-at-arms, sort of, so the girl called him Ser Soldier and bragged how he kept her safe. "Go away," Arya told her half a hundred times. "Just leave me be." She wouldn't, though, so finally Arya took the doll away from her, ripped it open, and pulled the rag stuffing out of its belly with a finger. "Now he really looks like a soldier!" she said, before she threw the doll in a brook. After that the girl stopped pestering her, and Arya spent her days grooming Craven and Stranger or walking in the woods. Sometimes she would find a stick and practice her needlework, but then she would remember what had happened at the Twins and smash it against a tree until it broke.</div>

We can rest up, maybe find a way to get a letter to your aunt." Arya's face darkened when she heard that. She didn't want to stay, but there was nowhere to go, either.

<div class="line_en">When they left, the Hound had a pouch full of coppers, a skin of sour ale, and a new sword. It was a very old sword, if truth be told, though new to him. He swapped its owner the longaxe he'd taken at the Twins, the one he'd used to raise the lump on Arya's head. The ale was gone in less than a day, but Clegane sharpened the sword every night, cursing the man he'd swapped with for every nick and spot of rust. If he lost his belly for fighting, why does he care if his sword is sharp? It was not a question Arya dared ask him, but she thought on it a lot.
