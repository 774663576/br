<div class="line_en">Sir Percival's spies attacked me on the road to Knowlesbury. One of them came up beside me, and bumped into me with his shoulder. I pushed him away, hard, and he immediately shouted for help. The other man ran up and the two of them held me between them. The first man accused me of attacking him, and they said they would take me to the police station in the town.</div>

<div class="line_en">At the police station the first man accused me of a violent attack, and the second man said he was a witness. I was locked up until the next magistrate's court, which was three days away. I could be released on bail, I was told, but how could I, a total stranger in the town, find a responsible person willing to pay money for my temporary freedom? The whole plan was now clear -- to get me out of the way for three days, while Sir Percival did whatever was necessary to prevent his secret being discovered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到了警察局，第一个人说我打他，另一个人说他是证人。我被关了起来，等着三天后法官开庭审理。他们告诉我可以保释，可是我在这里一个人也不认识，怎么可能找到一个愿意负责的人出钱让我获得暂时的自由呢？他们的整个计划很清楚——让我消失三天，珀西瓦尔爵士就利用这段时间尽一切可能保证他的秘密不被发现。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At first I was too angry to think clearly. Then I remembered Mr Dawson, the doctor. I had been to his house on my previous visit to Blackwater, so I knew his address. I wrote him a letter, explaining what had happened and begging for his help, and then asked for a messenger to deliver it. Two hours later the good doctor appeared, paid the required money and I was set free.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="刚开始，我非常气愤，头脑中一片混乱。后来我想起了道森先生，那位医生。上一次我去布莱克沃特的时候到过他家，所以我知道他的地址。我给他写了封信，告诉他出了什么事，请求他来帮我，然后找了一个送信的帮我把信送走。两个小时后，好心的医生来了，为我交了保释金，我自由了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was no time to lose. The news of my being free would doubtless reach Sir Percival within hours. I hurried to the lawyer's office, where I asked if I could see the copy of the Welmingham marriage register. Mr Wansborough was a pleasant man and agreed to show me the copy. In fact, he was quite amused. No one had asked to see it since his father (now dead) had locked it away in the office more than twenty years before.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="必须抓紧时间，因为我被释放的消息肯定几个小时之内就会传到珀西瓦尔爵士那里。我赶到律师的办公室，请求看一下韦明翰的结婚登记记录。万斯伯勒先生是个和气的人，他同意让我看副本。其实，应该说他很高兴，因为自从他父亲（现在已经去世了）20多年前把文件锁在办公室后，从未有人要求查看过。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As I opened the register, my hands trembled. I turned the pages to the year and month. I found the names I remembered just before, and just after, the marriage of Sir Percival's parents. And between these entries, at the bottom of the page…?</div>

<div class="line_en">Nothing! The marriage of Sir Felix Glyde and Cecilia Elster was not there! I looked again, to be sure. No, nothing. Not a doubt about it. Sir Percival must have seen the space in the Welmingham register and written in the marriage himself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="什么也没有！费利克斯·格莱德爵士和塞西莉亚·埃尔斯特的婚姻根本就没有记录！为了保险起见，我又看了一遍。没有，什么也没有，毫无疑问。珀西瓦尔爵士可能在韦明翰的记录中看到了那个空白，然后自己填上了那条记录。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I had never once suspected this. He was not Sir Percival Glyde at all! His parents had not been married, so he had no right to the inheritance of Blackwater Park, no right to the rank of Baronet, no right even to the name of Glyde! This was his secret -- and it was now mine to use against him!</div>

<div class="line_en">The copy of the register would be safe enough in the lawyer's office, but I decided to go back to Welmingham and make a copy of the false record from the church register. It was dark now and I ran all the way to the church clerk's house. I knocked on his door, but when he appeared, he looked suspicious and confused.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="当我们看到法衣室的时候，我发现从一个高处的窗户里发出很亮的光，夜晚的空气中有一股奇怪的味道，可以听到木头劈啪作响的声音，那光变得越来越亮。我跑到法衣室的门口，用手摸了摸门。法衣室起火了！">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I could not leave the town. There would be a legal enquiry into the accident the next day, which I had to attend, and in any case I had to report back to the police station in Knowlesbury. I returned to the hotel and wrote to Marian, telling her everything that had happened and warning her to keep the news from Laura for the moment.

<div class="line_en">He must have heard that I was free and on my way back to Welmingham, so he hurried to the church, stealing the keys and locking himself in to prevent anyone coming in and finding him. All he could do was tear the page out of the register and destroy it. If the false record no longer existed, I could produce no evidence to threaten him with. He must have dropped his lamp by accident, which started the fire. Then in his urgency to get out, the lock had become damaged and the key unmoveable.</div>

<div class="line_en">Twenty-three years ago I was a beautiful young woman living in Welmingham, married to a fool of a husband. I also knew a gentleman -- I shall not call him by his name. Why should I? It was not his own. I was born with expensive tastes. This man gave me expensive presents. Naturally he wanted something in return -- all men do. And what did he want? Just a little thing. The key to the church vestry, when my husband's back was turned. I liked my presents, so I got him the key. I watched him in the vestry without his knowing, and saw what he was doing. I did not know then how serious a crime it was. I said I would not tell anyone about the marriage he had added to the register if he told me about his private life. He agreed -- why, you will see in a moment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="23年前，我是一个年轻漂亮的姑娘，住在韦明翰，嫁给了一位傻乎乎的丈夫。我还结识了一位绅士——我不会称呼他的名字。为什么要那样叫他？那不是他的名字。我生来就喜欢贵重的东西，这个人送给我许多贵重礼物，当然他是需要回报的——男人都是这样。这个男人要的是什么？很简单的一样东西。教堂法衣室的钥匙，当然要趁我丈夫不在的时候。我喜欢那些礼物，所以给他弄到了钥匙。我盯着他，看他在法衣室干什么，他并没发觉。当时我不知道那是多么严重的罪行。我跟他说，要是他告诉我他的私事，我不会告诉任何人他擅自增加结婚记录的事。他答应了——至于为什么，你往下看就明白了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He said that he only found out that his parents were not married after his mother's death. His father confessed to it and promised to do what he could for his son. But he died having done nothing. The son came to England and took possession of the property. There was no one to say he could not. In fact, the right person to claim the property was a distant relation away at sea. However, to borrow money on the property, he needed a certificate of his parents' marriage. This was a problem -- a problem which brought him to Welmingham.</div>

<div class="line_en">However, when he saw there was a small space at the bottom of the page in the right year, he changed his plan and took the opportunity to write in the marriage himself. It took him some time, though, to practise the handwriting and to mix the right colour of ink, so that it looked the same.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，他发现那年的登记页上靠下面有一点空白，于是改变了主意，趁机把他父母的婚姻写了进去。当然，他也颇费了些时间去模仿登记用的笔迹，还有配制合适的墨水颜色，让这条记录看起来跟其他的没有差别。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As his parents had mostly lived abroad and had had no social life in England, who was to say (the priest being dead) that a private marriage had not taken place at Welmingham church? His plan was to tear out a page from the marriage register in the year before his birth and destroy it. Then he would tell his lawyers in London to get the necessary certificate, innocently referring them to the date on the page that was gone. At least no one could say that his parents were not married.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因为他父母大部分时间生活在国外，在英国没什么交际，所以谁会说（牧师已经死了）韦明翰教堂没举行过一场私下的婚礼呢？他的计划是把他出生前那一年的婚姻登记页撕下来销毁。然后，他就会告诉伦敦的律师们去取必要的证明文件，并假装不知情地把那个已经不存在的登记页上的日期告诉他们。至少谁也不会说他父母没结婚。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After my husband caught me talking secretly to him and after their fight together, I asked my fine gentleman to clear my name and to say there had been nothing between us. But he refused. He wanted everyone to believe something false, so that they would never suspect the truth. He then told me that the punishment for his crime, and anyone who helped him, was life in prison. He frightened me! If I spoke out, I was just as lost as he was. He then agreed to make me a yearly payment if I said nothing and stayed in Welmingham, where he could always find me and where there was no danger of my making friends and talking. This was hard, but I accepted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我丈夫看到我和他密谈，他们两个打了一架以后，我叫他帮我洗清名声，告诉别人我们之间什么也没发生，但是他拒绝了。他希望大家都相信并没有发生的事情，这样一来，人们就不会去想真相如何了。他还跟我说如果他的罪行败露，他以及帮过他的人都将被终生监禁。他让我害怕极了！如果我说出他的秘密，那我和他都完了。他答应每年支付我一笔钱，条件是我保持沉默，继续住在韦明翰，让他随时可以找到我，也免得我与人交朋友，然后乱讲话。虽说条件很苛刻，我还是答应了。">查看中文翻译</div>

Immediately she shouted, "Ask for my pardon, now, or I'll let out your secret and destroy your life. "My own words! He went white. Then he swore at us. It ended, as you know, by his shutting her up in an asylum. I tried to tell him she knew nothing. But he did not believe me.
