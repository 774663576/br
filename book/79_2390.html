<div class="line_en">The newspaper files were kept downstairs. They consisted of the Sidewinder Gazette that had gone bust in 1963, the Estes Park daily, and the Boulder Camera. No Denver papers at all.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Sidewinder Public Library was a small, retiring building one block down from the town's business area. It was a modest, vine-covered building, and the wide concrete walk up to the door was lined with the corpses of last summer's flowers. On the lawn was a large bronze statue of a Civil War general Jack had never heard of, although he had been something of a Civil War buff in his teenage years.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Not much," he said, having to strive to keep his voice pleasant now. She was prying, just the way she had always pried and poked at him when they had been at Stovington and Danny was still a crib-infant. Where are you going, Jack? When will you be back? How much money do you have with you? Are you going to take the car? Is Al going to be with you? Will one of you stay sober? On and on. She had, pardon the expression, driven him to drink. Maybe that hadn't been the only reason, but by Christ let's tell the truth here and admit it was one of them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不多，”他说，极力使声音显得快乐些。她在审讯他，从前在斯托文顿她常这样做，当时丹尼还是个婴儿。到哪里去，杰克？什么时候回来？身上带了多少钱？开车去吗？阿尔和你在一起吗？你们不会都喝醉吧？如此等等。他过去是——对不起，我得这样说——被她逼得只好去喝酒的。也许那不是唯一的原因，但是，凭上帝起誓，此话一点不假，那是原因之一。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He took the tin. "No Excedrin?" He saw the small recoil on her face and understood. It had been a bitter sort of joke between them at first, before the drinking had gotten too bad for jokes. He had claimed that Excedrin was the only nonprescription drug ever invented that could stop a hangover dead in its tracks. Absolutely the only one. He had begun to think of his morning-after thumpers as Excedrin Headache Number Vat 69.</div>

<div class="line_en">He tried to put the thought from his mind, more ill tempered than ever. He went to the main desk, fingering a matchbook cover with a telephone number on it.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Right." He slipped the tin of Anacin absently into his pocket, went back to the reader, and turned it off. When he was sure she was gone, he went upstairs himself. God, but it was a lousy headache. If you were going to have a vise-gripper like this one, you ought to at least be allowed the pleasure of a few drinks to balance it off.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好的。”他心不在焉地把安那辛小瓶放进口袋里，走过去关掉阅读机。确信她已离去之后，他自己也往楼上走去。老天，头疼得快炸了！如果你不得不忍受这被老虎钳夹住般的疼痛，你也应该有权喝几杯来平衡一下。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Thanks." He went out and down the walk, past the anonymous Civil War general. He began to walk toward the business block, hands stuffed in his pockets, head thudding like a leaden bell. The sky was also leaden; it was November 7, and with the new month the weather had become threatening. There had been a number of snow flurries. There had been snow in October too, but that had melted. The new flurries had stayed, a light frosting over everything -- it sparkled in the sunlight like fine crystal. But there had been no sunlight today, and even as he reached the drugstore it began to spit snow again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“谢谢。”他出了门，走过水泥路，从名气不大的将军塑像前经过，向商业区走去，双手插在口袋里，脑袋里像有铅锤在砸。天也是铅灰色的，今天是11月7日，进入这个月后，冬天的本色渐渐露出来了，小雪已经飘了好几场。10月份也下过雪，但很快就化了。新雪积上了，晶莹剔透，在阳光下闪闪发光，给大地披上了薄薄的银妆。今天没有阳光，他来到药店时，雪又开始下起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The phone booth was at the back of the building, and he was halfway down an aisle of patent medicines, jingling his change in his pocket, when his eyes fell on the white boxes with their green print.

About how they waited until the time was right and then turned it into a playground for Mafia bigwigs, and about how it had to be shut down in 1966 when one of them got a little bit dead.

<div class="line_en">"Your opinion doesn't surprise me." His headache was all gone now. There had been that one flash of pain, and that was all. His mind felt sharp and accurate, all the way down to millimeters. It was the way he usually felt only when the writing was going extremely well or when he had a three drink buzz on. That was another thing he had forgotten about Excedrin; he didn't know if it worked for others, but for him crunching three tablets was like an instant high.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你这个看法并不使我感到惊奇。”头痛已经完全消失了。这种头痛来得快，去得也快。现在，他的思维既精确又敏锐，毫厘不爽。这种情况只有在他写作极为顺手的时候或酒过三巡之后才会出现，他忘记了这是镇痛片的另一个作用。他不知道这种药是否对其他人也同样起作用，但又他来说，嚼三片这种药能使他达到巅峰状态。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now he said: "What you'd like is some sort of commissioned guidebook that you could hand out free to the guests when they checked in.

<div class="line_en">The question recurred: Why had he called Ullman in the first place? The number of the Surf-Sand in Lauderdale had been written in a small notebook by the phone and the CB radio in the office-plumbers' numbers, carpenters, glaziers, electricians, others. Jack had copied it onto the matchbook cover shortly after getting out of bed, the idea of calling Ullman fullblown and gleeful in his mind. But to what purpose? Once, during the drinking phase, Wendy had accused him of desiring his own destruction but not possessing the necessary moral fiber to support a full-blown deathwish. So he manufactured ways in which other people could do it, lopping a piece at a time off himself and their family. Could it be true? Was be afraid somewhere inside that the Overlook might be just what he needed to finish his play and generally collect tip his shit and get it together? Was he blowing the whistle on himself? Please God no, don't let it be that way. Please.</div>

<div class="line_en">He opened his eyes and wiped his mouth with his handkerchief. He wanted a drink. Hell, he needed one. There was a cafe just down the street, surely he had time for a quick beer on his way up to the park, just one to lay the dust…</div>

Wendy turning on the light, seeing his clothes ripped and smeared from some cloudy parking-lot scuffle that had occurred at a vaguely remembered honky-tonk just over the New Hampshire border hours before, crusted blood under his nose, now looking up at his wife, blinking stupidly in the light like a mole in the sunshine, and Wendy saying dully, You son of a bitch, you woke Danny up.

The chances of Ullman knowing who the owner was were no more than two in a thousand. At the interview, he had treated the cellar as another country -- a nasty underdeveloped one at that. If he had really wanted to know, he would have called Watson, whose winter number was also in the office notebook. Even Watson would not have been a sure thing but surer than Ullman.</div>

Besides jeopardizing his job, he could be closing off wide channels of information once Ullman called around and told people to beware of New Englanders bearing questions about the Overlook Hotel. He could have done his researches quietly, mailing off polite letters, perhaps even arranging some interviews in the spring… and then laughed up his sleeve at Ullman's rage when the book came out and he was safely away -- The Masked Author Strikes Again.</div>

<div class="line_en">Jack blinked up. "So it is." It was snowing hard. Sidewinder's main street was already heavily powdered, the center line obscured. Danny had his head tilted up to the white sky, his mouth open and his tongue out to catch some of the fat flakes drifting down.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杰克望了望天空，说：“是的，下雪了。”雪下得很大。大街上已经铺上了厚厚的积雪，马路中间的分界线已经看不出来了。丹尼仰着头，望着白茫茫的天空，嘴巴张得大大的，伸出舌头，想接住飘落的雪片。">查看中文翻译</div>
