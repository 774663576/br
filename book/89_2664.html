<div class="line_en">Britt-Marie is not sure exactly at what point the sun broke through the eternal gray haze of the January sky, but it seems to be looking ahead into the new season. Borg somehow looks different today. They drive past Toad's house, the one with the greenhouse outside. A pregnant woman is moving about inside. They pass more gardens, with more people in them, which is deeply strange now that Britt-Marie has got used to Borg's only road always being deserted. A few of them are young, a few have children, a few of them wave at the car. A man with a cap is standing there with a sign in his hand.</div>

<div class="line_en">Max lives in one of the big houses beyond the boundaries of the village, on its own secluded street and with windows so big that they could only have been put there by someone who thought it more important for people to be able to look in than out. Sven explains to Britt-Marie that the residents here have fought with the local council for years, with mounting hostility, to put them under the jurisdiction of the town rather than remaining a part of Borg. In the next moment he slams on his brakes as a BMW backs out, without looking, from a garage at the far end of the street. Fredrik is wearing sunglasses, spinning the wheel as if it's fighting his efforts to do so. Sven waves, but the BMW roars past; it might as well have driven straight through them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="麦克斯住在靠近博格边界的一座大房子里，那儿还有许多大房子，形成了一个独立的街区，窗户统统大得离谱，房屋的设计者仿佛觉得让外面的人透过窗户往里看，比让里面的人往外看更重要。斯文对布里特—玛丽解释说，这里的住户找地方议会闹了很多年，要求把他们这儿划归镇上的管辖范围，脱离博格。说话间，街区那头一座房子的车库门敞开了，一辆宝马突然从里面倒出来，宝马的主人好像根本不在乎路上有没有车。斯文慌忙踩下刹车。弗雷德里克坐在宝马车里，戴着墨镜，不情愿地让汽车拐了个弯。斯文朝他挥挥手，他却视若无睹，催动宝马呼啸而过，紧擦着布里特—玛丽的车身。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Max doesn't say a word on the way into town. When they stop outside the leisure center, he gets out of the backseat with his soccer ball tucked under his arm, drops it onto the asphalt, and drills a shot into the wall that is just about the hardest Britt-Marie has ever seen a ball being struck. Britt-Marie lets out the dog and Toad from the trunk. Bank follows them inside. Dino, Omar, and Vega come behind. Sven is at the back. Britt-Marie counts them several times and tries to work out who's missing, then hears Ben's voice, sounding rather pathetic, from somewhere around the far corner of the backseat.</div>

The coach person has such an amount of lemonade in his hair, on his face, and over his clothes that the amount of lemonade in the can must in some way have bypassed the natural laws of physics. The coach person points at Bank and Britt-Marie, so angry by this stage that the pointing action is executed by both hands, which, at this kind of distance, makes it difficult to determine whether he's actually pointing at all, or just demonstrating the approximate size of a badger.</div>
