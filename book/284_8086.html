<div class="line_en">At first each day which passed by for Mary Lennox was exactly like the others. Every morning she awoke in her tapestried room and found Martha kneeling upon the hearth building her fire; every morning she ate her breakfast in the nursery which had nothing amusing in it; and after each breakfast she gazed out of the window across to the huge moor which seemed to spread out on all sides and climb up to the sky, and after she had stared for a while she realized that if she did not go out she would have to stay in and do nothing -- and so she went out. She did not know that this was the best thing she could have done, and she did not know that, when she began to walk quickly or even run along the paths and down the avenue, she was stirring her slow blood and making herself stronger by fighting with the wind which swept down from the moor. She ran only to make herself warm, and she hated the wind which rushed at her face and roared and held her back as if it were some giant she could not see. But the big breaths of rough fresh air blown over the heather filled her lungs with something which was good for her whole thin body and whipped some red color into her cheeks and brightened her dull eyes when she did not know anything about it.</div>

<div class="line_en">But after a few days spent almost entirely out of doors she wakened one morning knowing what it was to be hungry, and when she sat down to her breakfast she did not glance disdainfully at her porridge and push it away, but took up her spoon and began to eat it and went on eating it until her bowl was empty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是，整整在户外待了几天以后，一天早晨她醒过来，知道什么是饿了。她坐下来吃早餐，不再鄙视地扫一眼她的粥然后推开，而是拿起勺子开吃，接着吃，直到碗空。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mary did not shout, but she looked at things. There was nothing else to do. She walked round and round the gardens and wandered about the paths in the park. Sometimes she looked for Ben Weatherstaff, but though several times she saw him at work he was too busy to look at her or was too surly. Once when she was walking toward him he picked up his spade and turned away as if he did it on purpose.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛丽没有叫喊，只是瞧各种东西。没有别的事可做。她围着那些花园绕了一圈又一圈，在庭院里的小径上游逛。有时候她去找季元本，但是她见着他那几次，他都忙得对她不屑一顾，要不就非常乖戾。一次她正朝他走去，他拎起铁锹转身就走，好像是故意的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">One place she went to oftener than to any other. It was the long walk outside the gardens with the walls round them. There were bare flowerbeds on either side of it and against the walls ivy grew thickly. There was one part of the wall where the creeping dark green leaves were more bushy than elsewhere. It seemed as if for a long time that part had been neglected. The rest of it had been clipped and made to look neat, but at this lower end of the walk it had not been trimmed at all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有个地方她比较常去。是墙围着的那个花园外的长走道。走道两侧是裸露的花床，墙上长满了密实的常春藤。墙上有一处，蔓延的墨绿叶片比别处更为浓密。看起来这一带无人过问很久了。其他地方修剪过，弄得整齐，但是走道低的这一头完全没有修剪过。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A few days after she had talked to Ben Weatherstaff, Mary stopped to notice this and wondered why it was so. She had just paused and was looking up at a long spray of ivy swinging in the wind when she saw a gleam of scarlet and heard a brilliant chirp, and there, on the top of the wall, perched Ben Weatherstaff's robin redbreast, tilting forward to look at her with his small head on one side.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在她和季元本讲过话几天以后，玛丽停下来注意到这个，奇怪为什么这样。她驻足抬头，正看着一蓬长长的常春藤在风里摇摆，突然她看到一瞥鲜红，听到一声清亮短促的鸟鸣——就在那儿，在墙顶上，季元本的红胸脯知更鸟，停在那儿，俯身看着她，小脑袋歪在一边。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He did answer. He twittered and chirped and hopped along the wall as if he were telling her all sorts of things. It seemed to Mistress Mary as if she understood him, too, though he was not speaking in words. It was as if he said:</div>

<div class="line_en">That reminded Mary of the first time she had seen him. He had been swinging on a tree-top then and she had been standing in the orchard. Now she was on the other side of the orchard and standing in the path outside a wall -- much lower down -- and there was the same tree inside.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这让玛丽想起初见它时。那次它在一棵树顶上摇荡着，而她站在果园里。现在她在果园另一边，站在墙外的小径上——这道墙要低多了，而里面是同一棵树。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I like you! I like you!" she cried out, pattering down the walk; and she chirped and tried to whistle, which last she did not know how to do in the least.

<div class="line_cn" title="“我喜欢你！我喜欢你！”她大声喊着，嗒嗒地顺着走道快跑下去；她唧唧鸣叫着，还试着吹口哨。她根本不会吹口哨。可是知更鸟好像很满意，鸣叫着，吹口哨回应她。最后它展开翅膀，一下子飞到一棵树顶上，停下来大声唱歌。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She ran up the walk to the green door she had entered the first morning. Then she ran down the path through the other door and then into the orchard, and when she stood and looked up there was the tree on the other side of the wall, and there was the robin just finishing his song and beginning to preen his feathers with his beak.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她顺小径往上，跑到第一天早晨她进过的绿门。接着她沿小径跑过另一道门进入果园，她站在那儿抬头，看到墙那边是那棵树，知更鸟刚刚唱完那首歌，开始用喙梳理羽毛。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She stayed out of doors nearly all day, and when she sat down to her supper at night she felt hungry and drowsy and comfortable. She did not feel cross when Martha chattered away. She felt as if she rather liked to hear her, and at last she thought she would ask her a question.

<div class="line_en">This gave her so much to think of that she began to be quite interested and feel that she was not sorry that she had come to Misselthwaite Manor.

<div class="line_en">She had made Martha stay with her and Martha had not objected at all. She was very young, and used to a crowded cottage full of brothers and sisters, and she found it dull in the great servants' hall downstairs where the footman and upper-housemaids made fun of her Yorkshire speech and looked upon her as a common little thing, and sat and whispered among themselves. Martha liked to talk, and the strange child who had lived in India, and been waited upon by "blacks," was novelty enough to attract her.</div>

It was Mrs. Craven's garden that she had made when first they were married an' she just loved it, an' they used to 'tend the flowers themselves. An' none o' th' gardeners was ever let to go in.
