<div class="line_en">It was a hot, muggy afternoon that August of 1992, and they were in the living room of Laila's house. Mammy had had a stomachache all day, and, minutes before, despite the rockets that Hekmatyar was launching from the south, Babi had taken her to see a doctor. And here was Tariq now, seated beside Laila on the couch, looking at the ground, hands between his knees.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那是1992年8月一个闷热的下午，他们就在莱拉家的客厅。妈妈的胃痛了一整天，就在几分钟之前，爸爸不顾古勒卜丁从南郊不断往城里发射火箭弹，带她看医生去了。塔里克在这儿，和莱拉一起，坐在沙发上；他低头看着地板，双手放在膝盖之间。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Laila could hardly move, as though cement had solidified in every one of her joints. There was a conversation going on, and Laila knew that she was at one end of it, but she felt removed from it, as though she were merely eavesdropping. As Tariq talked, Laila pictured her life as a rotted rope, snapping, unraveling, the fibers detaching, falling away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莱拉几乎无法动弹，仿佛全身的关节都被水泥凝固了。有人在说话，莱拉知道话是说给她听的，但她觉得这次谈话和她无关，好像她只是无意中听到的一样。塔里克说话的时候，莱拉感觉她的生活就像一条烂绳子，寸寸断裂，散成碎片，几股丝线不再交织在一起，消失无踪。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She should have seen this coming, she thought. Almost everyone she knew had packed their things and left. The neighborhood had been all but drained of familiar faces, and now, only four months after fighting had broken out between the Mujahideen factions, Laila hardly recognized anybody on the streets anymore. Hasina's family had fled in May, off to Tehran. Wajma and her clan had gone to Islamabad that same month. Giti's parents and her siblings left in June, shortly after Giti was killed. Laila didn't know where they had gone -- she heard a rumor that they had headed for Mashad, in Iran. After people left, their homes sat unoccupied for a few days, then either militiamen took them or strangers moved in.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她本该料到有这样的结局，她想。几乎她认识的每个人都收拾东西离开了。这个街区本来到处都是熟悉的脸庞，可现在，圣战组织不同派别之间的战斗才持续四个月，莱拉在马路上已经很难遇到认识的人了。哈西娜一家五月份就逃走了，去德黑兰。瓦吉玛和她的家族也在那个月去了伊斯兰堡。6月，吉提被杀害之后不久，她的父母和兄弟姐妹都离开了。莱拉不知道他们去了哪里——她听人说他们去了伊朗的麦什德。人们离开之后，他们的房子会空上几天，然后要么被士兵侵占，要么有陌生人搬进去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">IN THE COMING DAYS and weeks, Laila would scramble frantically to commit it all to memory, what happened next. Like an art lover running out of a burning museum, she would grab whatever she could -- a look, a whisper, a moan -- to salvage from perishing, to preserve. But time is the most unforgiving of fires, and she couldn't, in the end, save it all. Still, she had these: that first, tremendous pang of pain down below. The slant of sunlight on the rug. Her heel grazing the cold hardness of his leg, lying beside them, hastily unstrapped. Her hands cupping his elbows. The upside-down, mandolin-shaped birthmark beneath his collarbone, glowing red. His face hovering over hers. His black curls dangling, tickling her lips, her chin. The terror that they would be discovered. The disbelief at their own boldness, their courage. The strange and indescribable pleasure, interlaced with the pain. And the look, the myriad of looks, on Tariq: of apprehension, tenderness, apology, embarrassment, but mostly, mostly, of hunger.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接下来的几天和几个星期间，莱拉将会拼命地挣扎，拼命地想回忆起接下来发生的全部事情。她将会像一个艺术爱好者在一座起火的博物馆中奔跑那样，抓住一切——某个眼神，一声低语或呻吟——她能够从毁灭中拯救出来的东西，予以保存。但时间是最不能原谅的大火，事到头来，她终究未能完整地挽回记忆。尽管如此，她还记得这些：最先想起的是，下面传来一阵锥心的疼痛。斜斜地照在地毯上的阳光。她的脚后跟不断地摩擦着他匆忙解开、放在他们身边的那条冰冷粗硬的假腿。她的双手抓住他的手肘。他锁骨下方那块像倒放的曼陀林的红色胎记。他的脸在她的面庞上方晃动。他那黑色的头发垂下来，不停地拂着她的嘴唇和下巴。生怕他们会被人发现的恐惧情绪。他们自己的大胆和勇气引起的难以置信的感觉。和痛苦交织在一起的、无法形容的、奇怪的快感。还有塔里克脸上的表情，那无数个表情：恐惧的、温柔的、愧疚的、尴尬的神色，但最最主要的，是饥渴的表情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Please look at me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“请你看着我。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A groan came out of Laila. Then a wail. And then she was crying, and when he went to wipe her cheek with the pad of his thumb she swiped his hand away. It was selfish and irrational, but she was furious with him for abandoning her, Tariq, who was like an extension of her, whose shadow sprung beside hers in every memory. How could he leave her? She slapped him. Then she slapped him again and pulled at his hair, and he had to take her by the wrists, and he was saying something she couldn't make out, he was saying it softly, reasonably, and, somehow, they ended up brow to brow, nose to nose, and she could feel the heat of his breath on her lips again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莱拉发出一声哽咽。接着号啕大哭。她哭泣的时候，他用拇指帮她擦眼泪，她把他的手推开了。这个动作很任性，很不理智，但她为他抛弃自己而生气，塔里克，这个和她心心相印的人，这个她时时刻刻挂在心头的人，他怎么可以离开她？她甩了他一巴掌。然后她又打了他一个耳光，拉住他的头发，他只得抓着她的手腕，说了几句话，但她没有听清楚，他柔声地、通情达理地说着话，然后不知道怎么回事，他们两个变得额头抵着额头，鼻子碰着鼻子，她的嘴唇又一次感觉到他那火热的呼吸。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Laila saw three drops of blood on the rug, her blood, and pictured her parents sitting on this couch later, oblivious to the sin that she had committed. And now the shame set in, and the guilt, and, upstairs, the clock ticked on, impossibly loud to Laila's ears. Like a judge's gavel pounding again and again, condemning her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莱拉看见地毯上有三滴血，她的血；她想像过一会她的父母也会坐在这张沙发上，对她犯下的罪行一无所知。羞耻的感觉涌了上来，还有犯罪的感觉，楼上的时钟转动的声音在莱拉听来极其响亮。就像法官的木槌在不停地敲打、不停地指责她一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">THERE WAS FRENZY AFTER. Shirts hurriedly buttoned, belts buckled, hair finger-combed. They sat, then, they sat beside each other, smelling of each other, faces flushed pink, both of them stunned, both of them speechless before the enormity of what had just happened. What they had done.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="完事之后他们手忙脚乱。匆匆扣上衬衣的纽扣，系上皮带，用手梳理头发。然后，他们坐下来，挨在一起坐着，闻着对方的气息，两张脸泛着红晕，他们两人都呆呆的，两人都说不出话来，想着刚刚发生的罪恶。想着他们做过的事情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then Tariq said, "Come with me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后塔里克说：“跟我一起走。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For a moment, Laila almost believed that it could be done. She, Tariq, and his parents, setting out together. Packing their bags, climbing aboard a bus, leaving behind all this violence, going to find blessings, or trouble, and whichever came they would face it together. The bleak isolation awaiting her, the murderous loneliness, it didn't have to be.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="刹那间，莱拉几乎认为这件事确实可行。她、塔里克和他的父母一起启程。收拾他们的包裹，爬上一辆客车，把所有这些残暴抛在身后，去寻找幸福或者麻烦，而无论碰到什么麻烦，他们将会共同面对。现在等待着她的是荒凉的孤独，是无尽的寂寞，她没有必要过这样的日子。">查看中文翻译</div>

She stood there until he tired, until he gave up, and then she listened to his uneven footsteps until they faded, until all was quiet, save for the gunfire cracking in the hills and her own heart thudding in her belly, her eyes, her bones.</div>
