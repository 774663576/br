<div class="line_en">Ove brushes the snow off the gravestone. Digs determinedly into the frozen ground and carefully replenishes the flowers. He stands up, dusts himself off, and looks helplessly at her name, feeling ashamed of himself. He who always used to nag at her about being late. Now he stands here himself, apparently quite incapable of following her as he'd planned.</div>

<div class="line_en">He doesn't know what happened to him after her funeral. The days and weeks floated together in such a way, and in such utter silence, that he could hardly describe what exactly he was doing. Before Parvaneh and that Patrick backed into his mailbox he could barely remember saying a word to another human being since Sonja died.</div>

<div class="line_en">Some evenings he forgets to eat. That's never happened before, as far as he can remember. Not since he sat down with her on that train almost forty years ago. As long as Sonja was there they had their routines. Ove got up at quarter to six, made coffee, went off for his inspection. By half past six Sonja had showered and then they had breakfast and drank coffee. Sonja had eggs; Ove had bread. At five past seven, Ove carried her to the passenger seat of the Saab, stowed her wheelchair in the trunk, and gave her a lift to school. Then he drove to work. At quarter to ten they took coffee breaks separately. Sonja took milk in her coffee; Ove had it black. At twelve they had lunch. At quarter to three another coffee break. At quarter past five Ove picked up Sonja in the school courtyard, hoisted her into the passenger seat and the wheelchair into the trunk. By six o'clock they were at the kitchen table having their dinner, usually meat and potatoes and gravy. Ove's favorite meal. Then she solved crosswords with her legs drawn up beneath her on the sofa while Ove pottered about in the toolshed and watched the news. At half past nine Ove carried her upstairs to the bedroom. She nagged him for years about moving into the empty downstairs guest room, but Ove refused. After a decade or so she realized that this was his way of showing her that he had no intention of giving up. That God and the universe and all the other things would not be allowed to win. That the swine could go to hell. So she stopped nagging.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有时他会忘记吃晚饭。记忆中好像从来没有这样的情况。自从将近四十年前，他在那列火车上坐到她身边之后，也没有过。只要索雅在，生活就有规律。欧维每天差一刻六点时起床，煮咖啡，出门巡逻。六点半索雅洗完澡，他们一起吃早饭喝咖啡。索雅吃鸡蛋，欧维吃三明治。七点零五分，欧维把她抱到萨博的副驾驶座上，把轮椅塞进后备箱，开车把她送去学校。然后自己开车上班。十点不到一刻，他们各自休息喝杯咖啡。索雅在咖啡里加牛奶，欧维喝黑咖啡。十二点午餐。三点不到一刻又是休息时间。五点一刻，欧维到学校接索雅，把她抱上副驾驶座，把轮椅塞进后备箱。六点他们坐到厨房餐桌前共进晚餐。通常是肉和土豆佐以酱料，这是欧维的最爱。然后她坐到靠椅上垂着毫无知觉的双腿解填字游戏，这时候欧维就去外面的储藏室捣鼓一阵或者看会儿新闻。九点半欧维抱起她去楼上的卧室。意外之后几年里，她一直对他念叨着应该把卧室换到楼下的客房来。但欧维拒绝了。十几年后，她意识到，这是他向她表达绝不放弃的方式。不管上帝宇宙还是何方神圣都休想取胜。都见鬼去吧。于是，她再也不提。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">On Friday nights they sat up until half past ten watching television. On Saturdays they had a late breakfast, sometimes as late as eight. Then they went out to do their errands. The building supply store, furniture shop, and garden center. Sonja would buy potting soil and Ove liked to look at tools. They only had a small row house with a tiny outside space, yet there always seemed to be something to plant and something to build. On the way home they'd stop for ice cream. Sonja would have one with chocolate and Ove one with nuts. Once a year the shop raised the price by one krona per ice cream and then, as Sonja put it, Ove would "have a tantrum." When they got back to the house she'd roll out the little terrace door onto the patio and Ove would help her out of the chair and gently put her on the ground so she could do some gardening in her beloved flowerbeds. In the meantime Ove would fetch a screwdriver and disappear into the house. That was the best thing about the house. It was never finished. There was always a screw somewhere for Ove to tighten.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="周五晚上，他们会一直看电视到十点半。周六，早饭通常会推迟，有时甚至会推迟到八点。然后他们出门逛街。建材市场、家具城和园艺市场。索雅买土壤，欧维看看各种工具。他们只有一栋带一小片后院的联排别墅，门前有一小排花坛，但总有些花花草草要种，总有些地方要修修补补。回家路上，他们会吃个冰淇淋。索雅吃巧克力口味的，欧维吃果仁味的。每年冰淇淋都会涨一次价，每份贵个一克朗，这时候索雅就会说：“这可要了欧维的命呀。”回到排屋后，她就从厨房的院门推着轮椅到院子里。欧维帮助她从轮椅上下来，坐到地上。在花坛里种花是索雅最爱做的事，因为这时候即使无法站起来也没什么大不了的。欧维就找来一把螺丝刀进屋。房子最大的好处就是永远修不完。总有那么个把螺丝等着欧维去紧一紧。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="星期天他们会找个咖啡馆喝咖啡。欧维看报纸，索雅聊天。然后又是星期一。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And Ove didn't know exactly when he became so quiet. He'd always been taciturn, but this was something quite different. Maybe he had started talking more inside his own head. Maybe he was going insane (he did wonder sometimes). It was as if he didn't want other people to talk to him, he was afraid that their chattering voices would drown out the memory of her voice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维也不知道他是什么时候变得如此沉默的。或许他开始更常在心里说话。或许他快要疯了。有时他会这么想。好像他根本不想听别人对他说话，因为嘈杂的闲聊会淹没他对她声音的记忆。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He lets his fingers run gently across the gravestone, as if running them through the long tassels of a very thick rug. He's never understood young people who natter on about "finding themselves." He used to hear that nonstop from all those thirty-year-olds at work. All they ever talked about was how they wanted more "leisure time," as if that was the only point of working: to get to the point when one didn't have to do it. Sonja used to laugh at Ove and call him "the most inflexible man in the world." Ove refused to take that as an insult. He thought there should be some order in things. There should be routines and one should be able to feel secure about them. He could not see how it could be a bad attribute.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他用手指温柔地抚过墓碑，就像抚过一条厚毛毯的长穗。他从来不理解年轻人整天念叨的“寻找自我”。他常听公司里三十来岁的同事这么说。他们念念不忘地就想要更多业余时间，就好像这是工作的唯一目标：做到不用再做为止。索雅曾经嘲笑欧维，说他是世上最不灵活的人。欧维不愿把它当作耻辱。他只是喜欢循规蹈矩，仅此而已。凡事都该有个规律，让人有据可循。他不理解这怎么就成了缺点。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sonja used to tell people about the time that Ove, in a moment of temporary mental dislocation in the middle of the 1980s, had been persuaded by her to get himself a red Saab, even though in all the years she'd known him he'd always driven a blue one. "They were the worst three years of Ove's life," Sonja tittered. Since then, Ove had never driven anything but a blue Saab. "Other wives get annoyed because their husbands don't notice when they have their hair cut. When I have a haircut my husband is annoyed with me for days because I don't look the same," Sonja used to say.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="索雅总是跟人说，八十年代中期，欧维曾在她的劝说下——这只能归因于一时精神错乱——买了一辆红色的萨博，尽管她认识他的这些年来，他总是开蓝色的。“那是欧维一生中最糟糕的三年。”索雅嬉笑道。从那以后，欧维再没开过蓝色萨博以外的车。“别的太太总是因为先生没有注意到自己的新发型而生气，我理完发，因为看上去和平常不一样，先生几天不理我。”索雅总是这么说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It's thirteen years since Ove bought his blue Saab 9-5 station wagon. Not long after, the Yanks at General Motors bought up the last Swedish-held shares in the company. Ove closed the newspaper that morning with a long string of swear words that continued into a good part of the afternoon. He never bought a car again. He had no intention of placing his foot in an American car, unless his foot and the rest of his body had first been placed in a coffin, they should be bloody clear about that. Sonja had of course also read the article and she had certain objections to Ove's exact version of events regarding the company's nationality, but it made no difference. Ove had made up his mind and now he was fixed on it. He was going to drive his car until either he, or it, broke down. Either way, proper cars were not being made anymore, he'd decided. There was only a lot of electronics and crap inside them now. Like driving a computer. You couldn't even take them apart without the manufacturers whining about "invalid warranties." So it was just as well. Sonja said once that the car would break down with sorrow the day Ove was buried. And maybe that was true.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="十三年前，欧维买了一辆蓝色萨博9—5两厢。没过多久，通用汽车的美国佬就买走了公司里最后一份瑞典人的所有权。欧维合上报纸一通脏话，一直骂到下午，之后再也没有买过车。休想让他把腿迈进一辆美国车，除非双腿连着身子都一起先进了棺材，这他们可得搞清楚。索雅当然更仔细地读了这篇报道，也反对欧维对接管者国籍的历史成见，但这于事无补。欧维已经下定决心，绝不动摇。这辆车他要一直开下去，直到车毁或是人亡。从此以后，再没有什么正经汽车了，他认定。如今那些破车里只剩一堆破电子仪器，感觉就像开着台电脑。想不违反“保修协议”擅自打开发动机盖都不可能。索雅说，欧维葬礼的那天，这辆车会伤心到熄火的。或许真会这样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But there was a time for everything, she also said. Often. For example, when the doctors gave her the diagnosis four years ago. She found it easier to forgive than Ove did. Forgive God and the universe and everything. Ove got angry instead.

<div class="line_en">So he fought the whole world. He fought with hospital personnel and he fought with specialists and chief physicians.

Then a third contact person so she did not have to go to work and a fourth contact person to try to persuade the bloody authorities that this was precisely what she wanted: to go to work.</div>

<div class="line_en">Almost everyone did call. They came to visit in long lines. One weekend there were so many of them in the row house that Ove had to go outside and sit in his toolshed for six hours. When the last of them had left that evening he went around the house carefully assuring himself that nothing had been stolen. As usual. Until Sonja called out to him not to forget to count the eggs in the fridge. Then he gave up. Carried her up the stairs while she laughed at him. He put her in the bed, and then, just before they went to sleep, she turned to him. Hid her finger in the palm of his hand. Burrowed her nose under his collarbone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="几乎每个人都打来过电话。他们接踵而来。有个周末，排屋来的人太多，欧维不得不出门在储藏室里待了整整六个小时。晚上，最后一个人回家之后，他就在屋子里打转，仔细检查有没有人偷了东西。像往常一样，直到索雅喊他别忘了数数冰箱里的鸡蛋，才罢休。他一边抱着她上楼，把她放到床上，一边听凭她笑话他。入睡前，她转过身，把手指钻进他的掌心，把鼻子埋到他的锁骨上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"We have to take it as it comes," said Sonja. And that was what they did. She carried on working with her darling troublemakers for as long as she could, until Ove had to push her into the classroom every morning because she no longer had the strength to do it herself. After a year she was down to 75 percent of her full working week. After two years she was on 50 percent. After three years she was on 25 percent. When she finally had to go home she wrote a long personal letter to each of her students and exhorted them to call her if they ever needed anyone to talk to.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们顺其自然。”索雅说。他们就是这么做的。索雅继续为她挚爱着的熊孩子们工作，直到欧维必须每天把她推进教室里，因为她自己已经无能为力。一年后，她的工作量降到了75%，两年后降到了50%，三年后是25%，最后不得不病退回家的时候，她还给每个学生写了封长信，鼓励他们想找人说话时就给她打电话。">查看中文翻译</div>
