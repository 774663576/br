<div class="line_en">Ian Gibbons was the first experienced scientist Elizabeth had hired after launching Theranos. He came recommended by her Stanford mentor, Channing Robertson. Ian and Robertson had met at Biotrack in the 1980s, where they had invented and patented a new mechanism to dilute and mix liquid samples.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ian fit the stereotype of the nerdy scientist to a T. He wore a beard and glasses and hiked his pants high above his waist. He could spend hours on end analyzing data and took copious notes documenting everything he did at work. This meticulousness carried over to his leisure time: he was an avid reader and kept a list of every single book he'd read. It included Marcel Proust's seven-volume opus, Remembrance of Things Past, which he reread more than once.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="伊恩很符合宅男科学家的刻板印象：留胡子、戴眼镜，裤头拉得高过腰，可以连续好几个小时分析数据，工作上每件事都巨细靡遗一一笔记。这种注意细节的严谨态度也带到休闲生活，他是个饥渴的读者，看过的每本书都列入清单，其中包括马赛尔．普鲁斯特（Marcel Proust）的七册巨著《追忆似水年华》（Remembrance of Things Past），还读了不止一次。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">From 2005 to 2010, Ian led Theranos's chemistry work alongside Gary Frenzel. Ian, who had joined the startup first, was initially senior to Gary. But Elizabeth soon inverted their roles because Gary had better people skills, which made him a smoother manager. The two of them cut quite a contrast -- Ian, the reserved Englishman with a wry sense of humor, and Gary, the garrulous former rodeo rider who spoke with a Texas twang. But they had a good relationship grounded in their respect for each other as scientists and would sometimes roast each other in meetings.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从二〇〇五到二〇一〇年，Theranos的化学团队是由伊恩带领，盖瑞．法兰佐从旁协助。伊恩先进公司，一开始职位高于盖瑞，但是伊莉莎白很快就将两人角色对调，因为盖瑞比较善于人际往来，是比较八面玲珑的管理者。他们两人的个性正好形成对比——伊恩是拘谨寡言的英国人，幽默感属于冷嘲挖苦式；盖瑞则是喋喋不休，以前做过牛仔竞技表演人，说话带着德州鼻音腔——但两人基于对彼此科学家身分的敬重，关系很好，有时也会在会议上痛骂对方。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Besides reading, Ian's other two hobbies were going to the opera -- he and Rochelle regularly went to San Francisco's War Memorial Opera House and in the summer flew to New Mexico to attend open-air performances of the Santa Fe Opera at dusk -- and photography. For laughs, he liked altering photos. One of the many he doctored showed him as a gloved and bow-tied mad scientist mixing blue and purple potions. In another, he inserted himself into the foreground of a portrait of the British royal family.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="除了阅读，伊恩另外两个嗜好是看歌剧和摄影。他和罗雪儿固定会去旧金山战争纪念歌剧院（War Memorial Opera House），夏天会飞到新墨西哥州观赏圣塔菲歌剧院（Santa Fe Opera）的黄昏露天表演。此外，他喜欢修改照片取乐，有张照片里的他像个戴手套、别领结的疯狂科学家，正在搅拌蓝色和紫色混合药剂；还有一张照片，他把自己加进英国皇室成员中最显眼的位置。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ian and his wife, Rochelle, had met in the early 1970s at Berkeley. He had come over from England to do a postdoctorate fellowship in the university's department of molecular biology, where Rochelle was doing her graduate research. They'd never had children, but Ian doted on their dogs Chloe and Lucy and on Livia, a cat he'd named after the wife of the Roman emperor Augustus.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="伊恩和太太罗雪儿（Rochelle）在一九七〇年代初相识于柏克莱大学，他从英国来到柏克莱分子生物系做博士后研究，罗雪儿则是在柏克莱念研究所。两人没有小孩，但伊恩很宠爱他们的狗克萝伊（Chloe）和露西（Lucy），还有一只猫咪叫莉维亚（Livia），名字取自罗马皇帝奥古斯都的妻子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As a biochemist, Ian's specialty was immunoassays, which was the main reason Theranos had focused its early efforts on that class of test. He was passionate about the science of blood testing and loved to teach it. In the company's early years, he would sometimes hold little lectures to educate the rest of the staff about the fundamentals of biochemistry. He also did presentations about how to create various blood tests that were recorded and stored on the company's servers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="而在生物化学家的身分上，伊恩的专长是免疫测定，所以Theranos早期才会把心力都放在这种检测。他对血液检测这门科学怀有很大热情，也喜欢教人；在公司早期，有时他会举办小型授课，教其他同事生化基础。他也做过一些演示文稿，说明如何设计各种血液检测，这些演示文稿都有录像存在公司服务器。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">One source of recurring tension between Ian and the Theranos engineers was his insistence that the blood tests that he and the other chemists designed perform as accurately inside the Theranos devices as they did on the lab bench. The data he collected suggested that was rarely the case, which caused him considerable frustration. He and Tony Nugent butted heads over this issue during the development of the Edison. As admirable as Ian's exacting standards were, Tony felt that all he did was complain and that he never offered any solutions.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="伊恩和Theranos工程师一再出现紧张，原因之一是，他坚持他和其他化学家设计的血液检测运行于Theranos设备时，必须跟他们在实验室所做一样精准，而他拿到的数据却显示很少达到，这令他非常沮丧。在开发爱迪生阶段，他和东尼．纽金特为此争执不下。东尼觉得，伊恩的高标准固然令人钦佩，但他只是抱怨，没有提出任何解决方法。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ian also had issues with Elizabeth's management, especially the way she siloed the groups off from one another and discouraged them from communicating. The reason she and Sunny invoked for this way of operating was that Theranos was "in stealth mode," but it made no sense to Ian. At the other diagnostics companies where he had worked, there had always been cross-functional teams with representatives from the chemistry, engineering, manufacturing, quality control, and regulatory departments working toward a common objective. That was how you got everyone on the same page, solved problems, and met deadlines.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="伊恩对伊莉莎白的管理也有意见，尤其是她竖起高墙隔开各个团队，不鼓励沟通交流。伊莉莎白和桑尼的理由是Theranos还处于「隐藏模式」，但是伊恩不以为然，在他以前工作过的诊断公司，跨部门沟通一定有，化学、工程、制造、品管、法规等部门的代表朝共同目标一起合作，如此每个人接收到的消息才会一致，才能共同解决问题、在期限内完成目标。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ian's frustrations bubbled over in the fall of 2010 as Theranos's courtship of Walgreens intensified. He complained to his old friend Channing Robertson. Ian thought Robertson would keep their conversation private, but he reported everything Ian had said to Elizabeth. Rochelle was in bed when Ian arrived at their Portola Valley home late that Friday night. He told his wife that Robertson had betrayed his confidence and that Elizabeth had fired him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="二〇一〇年秋天，Theranos对沃尔格林药局的追求日益殷切，伊恩的沮丧溢于言表。他跑去向老朋友钱宁．罗伯森抱怨，他以为罗伯森不会公开两人的谈话，没想到他却把伊恩所说的一切向伊莉莎白报告。那个周五晚上，伊恩回到波托拉谷（Portola Valley）家中时，罗雪儿已经上床就寝，他告诉太太，罗伯森背叛了他的信任，伊莉莎白开除他了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Elizabeth's loose relationship with the truth was another point of contention. Ian had heard her tell outright lies more than once and, after five years of working with her, he no longer trusted anything she said, especially when she made representations to employees or outsiders about the readiness of the company's technology.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="伊莉莎白对事实的轻忽也是争执原因之一。伊恩不只一次听到她脸不红气不喘地说谎，跟她共事五年后，他不再相信她说的任何话，尤其当她向员工或外人谈到公司技术已就绪可用时。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">To their surprise, Sunny called the next day. Unbeknownst to Ian, in the intervening hours several of his colleagues had lobbied Elizabeth to reconsider. Sunny offered Ian his job back, albeit without the same responsibilities. Ian had been head of the general chemistry group, which was in charge of creating new blood tests beyond the immunoassays they'd developed for the Edison, when Elizabeth fired him. He was allowed to come back as a technical consultant to the group, but its leadership was given to Paul Patel, a biochemist who had been hired two months earlier on Ian's recommendation.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="令夫妇俩惊讶的是，隔天桑尼来电，原来在伊恩不知情的情况下，有好几个同事央求伊莉莎白收回成命，于是桑尼来电请他回去上班，只是职位有所调整。伊恩原本是普通化学团队的主管，除了开发用于爱迪生的免疫测定，也负责设计其他新的检测，现在重回工作则是担任化学团队的顾问，领导职交由保罗．帕特尔（Paul Patel）负责，这位生化学家是两个月前才在伊恩推荐下网罗进来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ian was a proud man and he took the demotion hard. The humiliation he felt was compounded when, eighteen months later, the company moved to the old Facebook building and he lost the private office he'd had at the Hillview Avenue headquarters. To be sure, he wasn't the only one being marginalized by then: Gary Frenzel and Tony Nugent too were being sidelined as Elizabeth and Sunny hired and promoted newer recruits over them. It was as if the company's old guard -- the people who had gotten Elizabeth to this point -- was being mothballed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="伊恩是自尊心很强的人，对这次降职耿耿于怀，一年半后，受辱的感觉更进一步加深，因为公司搬到脸书旧址，他原先在山景大道总部的私人办公室没了。当然，他不是当时唯一被边缘化的人，盖瑞．法兰佐、东尼．纽金特也遭到排挤，桑尼聘请了新成员，而且职位在他们之上，这家公司的老臣（帮助伊莉莎白走到这个地步的人）似乎一一被打入冷宫。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A few months before the move, Tony had noticed a poster for the movie Women in Love in Ian's office and they got to talking. The 1969 film was based on D. H. Lawrence's novel of the same name about the relationships between two sisters and two men in an English mining town around the time of the First World War. Ian mentioned that he'd toured Ireland when it came out, which would have coincided with when Tony was still a child growing up there. That led to other musings. Tony learned that Ian's father had been captured in North Africa during World War II. After initially being detained in a POW camp in Italy, he had been marched across Europe to a different camp in Poland, where he was liberated at the end of the war.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="搬家前几个月，东尼在伊恩办公室看到电影《恋爱中的女人》（Women in Love）海报，两人聊了起来。那部电影改编自D. H。劳伦斯（D. H。 Lawrence）的同名小说，故事背景为第一次世界大战，描述英国煤矿小镇上一对姊妹和两名男子的爱恋。伊恩提到，电影上映时他在爱尔兰旅游，刚好当时年纪还小的东尼仍住在那里。这段闲聊令两人陷入沉思。东尼知道伊恩的父亲在二次大战曾在北非被俘，一开始拘留于意大利战俘营，后来步行穿越欧洲大陆到波兰另一个战俘营，一直待到战争结束才获释。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The conversation eventually drifted back to the here and now and to Theranos. Tony, who like Ian no longer had Elizabeth's favor and was being excluded from the development of the miniLab, floated the notion that perhaps the company was just a vehicle for Elizabeth and Sunny's romance and that none of the work they did really mattered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="谈话最后拉回此时此刻的Theranos。跟伊恩一样不再受宠、被排除于「迷你实验室」开发之外的东尼，提出一个想法：也许这家公司只是伊莉莎白和桑尼用来谈恋爱的工具，他们做的工作根本就不重要。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tony didn't know any French, so he left to go look up the expression in the dictionary. The definition he found struck him as apt: "The presence of the same or similar delusional ideas in two persons closely associated with one another."</div>

<div class="line_en">One day, the engineer Tom Brumett ran into him at Fish Market, a seafood restaurant on El Camino Real where he was meeting a friend. As they stood in line waiting for a table, Ian asked if he could join them. Tom and Ian were both in their mid-sixties and had established a friendly rapport. The first time they'd interacted was shortly after Tom came to work at Theranos in 2010. Upset that Sunny and other managers were disregarding his opinion during a discussion about what sort of engineering personnel should be hired to assist him, Tom had walked out of the meeting in a huff with thoughts of quitting. Ian had come running after him and assured him that his opinion did matter -- a gesture Tom had greatly appreciated.</div>

<div class="line_en">Tom ran into Ian one last time in early 2013 in the office cafeteria. By then, he looked despondent. Tom tried to buck him up, reminding him that he was earning decent money and urging him not to take his work predicament so seriously. It was just a job, after all. But Ian just stared at his plate, disconsolate.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="汤姆最后一次看到伊恩是二〇一三年初，在公司的员工餐厅。当时他看起来很郁闷，汤姆想给他打气，提醒他，他的薪水很优渥，鼓励他不要把工作处境看得那么严重，毕竟只是一份工作罢了，但是伊恩只盯着自己的餐盘，郁郁寡欢。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Over the next two years, Tom had noticed Ian's growing gloom. As they sat down for lunch at Fish Market, Tom wondered whether Ian had followed him there. Most Theranos employees ate the food Elizabeth and Sunny had catered and didn't leave the office during the day. What's more, the restaurant wasn't near the office and Ian had walked in just a minute or two after him. Ian had probably hoped to catch him alone, Tom thought. He seemed desperate for someone to talk to. But Tom was there to reconnect with his friend, a salesman for a Japanese chipmaker. They tried to include Ian in the conversation, but he remained quiet after an initial exchange of pleasantries. Later, when he replayed the scene in his mind, Tom realized he'd ignored his colleague's silent cry for help.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接下来两年，汤姆注意到伊恩愈来愈忧郁。那次在餐厅一起用餐，汤姆甚至怀疑是不是伊恩默默跟着他到那里。Theranos员工大多吃伊莉莎白和桑尼提供的食物，白天不会离开办公室，更何况那家海鲜餐厅离公司并不近，而且只相隔一、二分钟伊恩就跟在他后面进来，汤姆心想，很可能伊恩想赶上他，与他一起用餐。伊恩似乎很想找人说话，但是汤姆是去找朋友的，一个在日本芯片厂工作的业务人员，他们试着把伊恩纳入谈话，但他一开始说了几句寒暄客套话之后就沉默不语。事后回想起当时的情景，汤姆突然了解，他忽视了这位同事无声的求助。">查看中文翻译</div>

Sam was perceived by some of his colleagues as a yes-man who did Sunny's bidding. Throughout 2012, Ian and Paul had several tense meetings with Sam.

He'd been diagnosed with colon cancer six years earlier and had missed some time at work after undergoing surgery and chemotherapy. Colleagues assumed that the cancer had returned.

<div class="line_en">In April, Theranos informed Ian that he had been subpoenaed to testify in the Fuisz case. The prospect of being deposed made him nervous. He and Rochelle discussed the lawsuit several times. Rochelle had once done work as a patent attorney, so Ian asked her to review Theranos's patent portfolio in the hope that she could give him some advice. While doing so, she noticed that Elizabeth's name was on all the company's patents, often in first place in the list of inventors. When Ian told her that Elizabeth's scientific contribution had been negligible, Rochelle warned him that the patents could be invalidated if this was ever exposed. That only served to make him more agitated.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="四月，Theranos通知伊恩，傅伊兹诉讼案要传他出庭作证。出庭作证这件事令他紧张不已。他和罗雪儿讨论过这起官司好几次，罗雪儿曾做过专利律师，所以伊恩请她查看Theranos的专利清单，希望她能给些建议。查看清单时，罗雪儿发现Theranos所有专利都有伊莉莎白的名字，常常还居于发明者首位。伊恩告诉她，伊莉莎白的科学贡献微不足道，罗雪儿警告他，如果这件事曝光，那些专利可能会无效，这番话只有让伊恩更加焦虑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ian couldn't tell whether there was any foundation for Elizabeth's theft allegation when he read the Fuisz patent and the early Theranos patent applications side by side. But he knew one thing for sure: he didn't want to be involved in the case. And yet he worried that his job depended on it. He'd started drinking heavily in the evenings. He told Rochelle that he didn't think he could ever resume a normal schedule at Theranos. The thought of going back to the office made him sick, he said. Rochelle told him he should quit if the job made him that miserable. But resigning didn't seem like an option to him. At age sixty-seven, he didn't think he would be able to find another job. He also clung to the idea that he could still help the company fix its problems.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="伊恩把傅伊兹的专利和Theranos早期的专利申请拿来比对，他看不出伊莉莎白所指控的偷窃是否有任何事实根据，不过有一件事他很确定：他不想卷入这起诉讼。然而，他担心这起官司会决定自己的去留。他开始在晚上豪饮，他告诉罗雪儿他大概回不去Theranos正常工作了，一想到回去那个办公室，他就很不舒服。罗雪儿告诉他，如果这份工作让他这么痛苦，那就应该辞职。但是辞职似乎不是他的选项，已经六十七岁的他，不认为自己能找到其他工作，更何况他还坚信自己能协助这家公司修补问题。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">On May 15, Ian contacted Elizabeth's assistant to schedule a meeting with her, hoping to work out some sort of alternative employment arrangement. But when the assistant called back to confirm a meeting for the next day, Ian became anxious. He told Rochelle he was worried that Elizabeth would use the meeting to fire him. That same day, he got a call from the Theranos lawyer David Doyle. After trying for weeks to get the Boies Schiller attorneys to propose a date for Ian's deposition, the Fuiszes' lawyers had run out of patience and sent notice that he would have to appear at their offices in Campbell, California, at 9:00 a. m. on May 17.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="五月十五日，伊恩联系伊莉莎白助理安排时间跟她会面，他希望找出替代的工作模式，但是等助理回电确认第二天碰面后，伊恩又开始焦虑，他告诉罗雪儿，他担心伊莉莎白会利用这次会面开除他。同样在那天，他接到Theranos的律师大卫．道伊尔来电。傅伊兹的律师这两周，不断催促BSF律师提出伊恩的出庭日期，现在他们已经失去耐心，寄出通知要求伊恩必须在五月十七日上午九点，现身他们在加州坎贝尔市（Campbell）的办公室。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That's what Doyle was calling about. With the deadline for his appearance less than two days away, the lawyer encouraged Ian to invoke health issues to get out of the deposition and emailed him a doctor's note for his physician to adapt and sign. Ian forwarded the email to his personal Gmail address and, from there, to his wife's email address, asking her to print it. His anxiety seemed to reach a new fevered pitch.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="道伊尔就是为此来电。距离出庭期限不到两天，道伊尔怂恿伊恩以健康为由回避出庭，还寄了份医生证明给他，供他的医生采用、签名。伊恩把这封电邮转寄到自己私人Gmail信箱，再从那个信箱寄给太太，请她印出。他的焦虑似乎到达新高点。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Rochelle had known for a while that Ian wasn't well, but she'd had other concerns weighing on her mind: she was grieving her mother, who had just passed away and left behind a complicated estate to sort out, and she had just launched a new law practice with an associate. Part of her had been resentful that she wasn't getting the marital support she needed during this stressful period of her life. But Ian's anguished state that day made her realize how dire his mental condition had become. She got him to agree to get help and scheduled an appointment with his general practitioner for the next morning.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="伊恩身体不好，罗雪儿已经知道好一阵子，但是她的心头也有其他担忧压着：她正处于丧母的悲痛中，母亲身后留下的复杂房产还有待厘清，而且她刚跟朋友开始合伙执业。她内心有些怨怼，不满在这段压力满载的时期，没有从另一半身上获得支持，不过看到伊恩那天的痛苦，她明白他的心理状态已经岌岌可危，她要他答应向外求助，并且约好隔天早上去找家庭医师。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When Rochelle got up around seven thirty a. m. on May 16, she saw that the bathroom light was on and the door closed. She assumed Ian was getting ready to go to the doctor's. But when he failed to come out after a while and didn't answer her calls, she pushed the bathroom door open. She found her husband hunched over in a chair unconscious and barely breathing. Panicked, she called 911.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="五月十六日早上七点半左右，罗雪儿醒来，看到浴室的灯亮着、门紧闭，她以为伊恩在盥洗准备去看医生，但是过了一阵子他没出来，也没有回应她的呼唤。她推开浴室门，发现丈夫弓着身子坐在椅子上，失去意识，几乎没了呼吸，惊恐的她赶紧打一一九。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ian spent the next eight days hooked up to a ventilator at Stanford Hospital. He had taken enough acetaminophen, the active ingredient in painkillers like Tylenol, to kill a horse. Combined with the wine he'd consumed, the drug had destroyed his liver. He was pronounced dead on May 23. As an expert chemist, Ian knew exactly what he was doing. Rochelle later found a signed will that he'd had witnessed by Paul Patel and another colleague a few weeks before.</div>

<div class="line_en">Inside Theranos, Ian's death was handled with the same cold, businesslike approach. Most employees weren't even informed of it. Elizabeth notified only a small group of company veterans in a brief email that made a vague mention of holding a memorial service for him. She never followed up and no service was held. Longtime colleagues of Ian's like Anjali Laghari, a chemist who had worked closely with him for eight years at Theranos and for two years before that at another biotech company, were left guessing about what had happened. Most thought he had died of cancer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在公司内部，对于伊恩的逝世还是用那套冷冰冰、公事公办的方式处理，大多数员工甚至毫不知情。伊莉莎白只透过一封简短电邮告知一小群资深员工，信里含糊地提到要为他举办一场纪念仪式，但是后来完全没有下文，更没有什么仪式。伊恩的老同事们——譬如化学家安嘉莉．赖格丽（Anjali Laghari），她跟伊恩在Theranos共事了八年，两人进入Theranos前也在另一家生技公司共事两年——只能猜测到底发生了什么，大多数人都以为他死于癌症。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tony Nugent became upset that nothing was done to honor his late colleague's memory. He and Ian hadn't been close. In fact, they had fought like cats and dogs at times during the Edison's development. But he was bothered by the lack of empathy being shown toward someone who had contributed nearly a decade of his life to the company. It was as if working at Theranos was gradually stripping them all of their humanity. Determined to show he was still a human being with compassion for his fellow man, Tony downloaded a list of Ian's patents from the patent office's online database and cut and pasted them into an email. He embedded a photo of Ian above the list and sent the email around to the two dozen colleagues he could think of who had worked with him, making a point to copy Elizabeth. It wasn't much, but it would at least give people something to remember him by, Tony thought.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="东尼．纽金特很生气，竟然没有做任何事表彰这位已故同事的贡献，他和伊恩并不亲近，事实上两人在爱迪生研发阶段有时吵得很凶，但是对一个贡献了将近十年生命给这家公司的人，却如此无动于衷，这令他很恼怒。仿佛在Theranos工作渐渐拿掉了他们的人性，为了证明自己仍是个对同伴有怜悯心的人，东尼从专利局在线数据库下载了伊恩的专利，剪贴到电邮里，再嵌进一张伊恩的照片，然后把信寄给二十几个同事，都是他能想到曾跟伊恩共事的人，还特别传了一份给伊莉莎白。这么做不算什么，但至少给大家一个东西去纪念他，东尼心想。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Rochelle was overwhelmed with grief but she found the strength to call Elizabeth's office and left a message with her assistant informing her about Ian's passing. Elizabeth didn't call back. Instead, later that day, Rochelle received an email from a Theranos lawyer requesting that she immediately return Ian's company laptop and cell phone and any other confidential information he might have retained.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="罗雪儿哀痛崩溃，但还是强打起精神致电到伊莉莎白办公室，留言给她的助理，告知伊恩已经过世。伊莉莎白没有回电，那天稍晚罗雪儿反而收到一封来自Theranos律师的电邮，要求她立刻交回伊恩的公司笔电和手机，以及他可能保留的其他机密数据。">查看中文翻译</div>
