<div class="line_en">The grief kept surprising Mariam. All it took to unleash it was her thinking of the unfinished crib in the toolshed or the suede coat in Rasheed's closet. The baby came to life then and she could hear it, could hear its hungry grunts, its gurgles and jabbering. She felt it sniffing at her breasts. The grief washed over her, swept her up, tossed her upside down. Mariam was dumbfounded that she could miss in such a crippling manner a being she had never even seen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="悲哀的延续出乎玛丽雅姆的意料。她一想到工具屋中那张未完工的婴儿床或者拉希德衣柜中那件羊皮外套，就忍不住悲从中来。那个胎儿仿佛活了过来，她能听到它的声音，能听见它饥饿的哼哼声，听到它在咯咯笑，听到它在牙牙学语。她甚至还觉得它在吮吸她的乳房。这悲哀让她身心皆疲，颠三倒四。为了一个未曾见过的生灵，玛丽雅姆竟然会如此昼思夜想，神魂俱碎，这让她自己也大吃一惊。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then there were days when the dreariness didn't seem quite as unrelenting to Mariam. Days when the mere thought of resuming the old patterns of her life did not seem so exhausting, when it did not take enormous efforts of will to get out of bed, to do her prayers, to do the wash, to make meals for Rasheed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后，有那么一段日子，玛丽雅姆心中这种凄凉的感觉似乎有所消退了。在这些日子中，她不再一想到要重新过上先前的生活就觉得浑身无力，而且也无需再作半天思想斗争才能挣扎着下床，才能做祷告，才能洗衣服，才能给拉希德做饭。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mariam dreaded going outside. She was envious, suddenly, of the neighborhood women and their wealth of children. Some had seven or eight and didn't understand how fortunate they were, how blessed that their children had flourished in their wombs, lived to squirm in their arms and take the milk from their breasts. Children that they had not bled away with soapy water and the bodily filth of strangers down some bathhouse drain. Mariam resented them when she overheard them complaining about misbehaving sons and lazy daughters.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛丽雅姆害怕出门。突然之间，她妒忌邻里那些女人，妒忌她们有那么多小孩。有的生了七八个，却不知道她们有多么幸运；她们的孩子得蒙受多少恩宠，才能在她们的子宫中茁壮成长，才能活着在她们的怀抱中蠕动，吮吸她们的乳房。她们并没有流产，并没有将这些孩子混在香皂水和陌生人身体的污垢之中冲下公共浴室的下水道。每当听到她们说出儿子做错事、女儿太懒惰之类的抱怨，玛丽雅姆便忍不住憎恨她们。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Other days, Mariam was besieged with anger. It was Rasheed's fault for his premature celebration. For his foolhardy faith that she was carrying a boy. Naming the baby as he had. Taking God's will for granted. His fault, for making her go to the bathhouse. Something there, the steam, the dirty water, the soap, something there had caused this to happen. No. Not Rasheed. She was to blame. She became furious with herself for sleeping in the wrong position, for eating meals that were too spicy, for not eating enough fruit, for drinking too much tea.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在另外一些日子里，玛丽雅姆怒火攻心。这全都怪拉希德过早的庆祝。这全都因为他那愚蠢的信念，以为她怀着的是一个男孩。干吗急着给孩子起名呢。把真主的赏赐视为理所当然。这全都怪他，让她去公共浴室。导致发生这种事情的，正是那儿的某些东西：蒸汽、脏水、香皂。不。不怪拉希德。应该怪她自己。她为自己睡觉的姿势不对、为自己吃了太辣的食物、为自己没有吃足够多的水果、为自己喝了太多的茶而自责不已。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Some days, she believed that the baby had been an undeserved blessing, that she was being punished for what she had done to Nana. Wasn't it true that she might as well have slipped that noose around her mother's neck herself? Treacherous daughters did not deserve to be mothers, and this was just punishment. She had fitful dreams, of Nana's jinn sneaking into her room at night, burrowing its claws into her womb, and stealing her baby. In these dreams, Nana cackled with delight and vindication.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在一些时日中，她相信这个孩子不会受到真主的保佑，她相信这是报应，惩罚她对娜娜做过的事。难道将绳索套上她母亲脖子的，不正是她本人吗？忤逆的女儿不配当母亲，这是罪有应得的报应。她时不时做梦，梦见娜娜体内的妖怪在夜晚溜进她的房间，它的爪子伸进她的子宫，窃走她的孩子。在这些梦境中，娜娜高兴地咯咯笑，还为自己辩护。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was God's fault, for taunting her as He had. For not granting her what He had granted so many other women. For dangling before her, tantalizingly, what He knew would give her the greatest happiness, then pulling it away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是真主的错，因为他如此摆布她的命运。这全都怪真主，没有把他赏赐给许多其他女人的东西也赏赐给她。用他知道会给她带来最大快乐的东西在她面前摇摇晃晃地引诱她，却又将其取走。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But it did no good, all this fault laying, all these harangues of accusations bouncing in her head. It was kofr, sacrilege, to think these thoughts. Allah was not spiteful. He was not a petty God. Mullah Faizullah's words whispered in her head: Blessed is He in Whose hand is the kingdom, and He Who has power over all things, Who created death and life that He may try you.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是她脑海中回荡着的所有这些怪罪、所有这些指责全都没有带来什么帮助。这些念头亵渎了真主。安拉并不恶毒。他并不是卑鄙的真主。法苏拉赫毛拉的话在她脑里低响：他掌管人间，他主宰万物，他创造了死与生，得到他的考验是你的光荣。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">MEANWHILE, a change had come over Rasheed ever since the day at the bathhouse. Most nights when he came home, he hardly talked anymore. He ate, smoked, went to bed, sometimes came back in the middle of the night for a brief and, of late, quite rough session of coupling. He was more apt to sulk these days, to fault her cooking, to complain about clutter around the yard or point out even minor uncleanliness in the house. Occasionally, he took her around town on Fridays, like he used to, but on the sidewalks he walked quickly and always a few steps ahead of her, without speaking, unmindful of Mariam who almost had to run to keep up with him. He wasn't so ready with a laugh on these outings anymore. He didn't buy her sweets or gifts, didn't stop and name places to her as he used to. Her questions seemed to irritate him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="与此同时，自在公共浴室那天开始，拉希德就发生了变化。多数夜晚，他回家之后，几乎再也不说话了。他吃饭，抽烟，上床，有时候，在三更半夜，他会走进玛丽雅姆的房间，草草地和她过一阵短暂的夫妻生活。这些日子以来，他变得更容易发火了，挑剔她做的饭不够香，指责她收拾的院子不够整洁，或者甚至为屋子里一点点污迹而大发脾气。他偶尔会跟过去一样，在星期五那天带她去城里逛逛，但他在人行道上步履如飞，总是比她走快几步，一言不发，丝毫不顾玛丽雅姆几乎要跑起来才能跟得上他的脚步。在这些外出的场合，他再也不会动不动就哈哈大笑了。他再也不给她买糖果或者礼物，再也不会像过去那样停下来，跟她说某个地方叫什么名字。她的问题似乎总是让他不耐烦。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ransacked with guilt, Mariam would kneel and pray for forgiveness for these thoughts.</div>

<div class="line_en">One night, they were sitting in the living room listening to the radio. Winter was passing. The stiff winds that plastered snow onto the face and made the eyes water had calmed. Silvery fluffs of snow were melting off the branches of tall elms and would be replaced in a few weeks with stubby, pale green buds. Rasheed was shaking his foot absently to the tabla beat of a Hamahang song, his eyes crinkled against cigarette smoke.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有一天夜里，他们坐在客厅，听着收音机。冬天的日子就要过完了。将雪花吹到人们脸上、吹得人们眼泪直流的寒风已经平息了。银白色的积雪已经开始从榆树的枝头融化成水滴下来，再过几个星期，就会被刚冒出头的浅绿色嫩芽取代。收音机在播一首哈马汉[1]的歌曲，拉希德心不在焉地跟着歌曲中的鼓声摇晃着他的脚，香烟熏得他双眼眯了起来。【注：[1]Ustad Hamahang，乌斯塔德·哈马罕，阿富汗歌唱家。】">查看中文翻译</div>
