<div class="line_en">A long time ago there was an Emperor who loved new clothes. He spent his whole life searching for new things to wear. He didn't do any of the things which Emperors are supposed to do. He never visited his army, never made a speech, never opened a new school or hospital... no, the only time his people saw him was when he walked through the city showing off his newest clothes. People would see him and whisper, 'Look at his wonderful hat.' Or 'Those silk trousers! What beautiful colours!'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">'Fine,' said the tall stranger. 'Tell your Emperor that he's just missed the chance to buy the most wonderful, magical clothes the world has ever seen. Goodbye.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">'Impossible,' said the palace gatekeeper. 'A box of new shoes has just arrived from China and His Majesty will be spending the whole day trying them on. He'll have no time to see people.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One day two strangers arrived in the city. One was a very tall thin man with a long pointed nose. The other, small and round, had not a single hair on his head. The strange pair drove their cart straight to the Emperor's palace, and asked to see the Emperor.</div>

<div class="line_en">'Of course Your Majesty will be able to see our magical cloth but anyone who is stupid or not fit for his job will see nothing. To stupid people our cloth will be invisible.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">'Wait,' said the gatekeeper. 'Magical, you say? Perhaps His Majesty might spare a moment for you. Wait there.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">'Your Majesty,' said the small round stranger, 'my partner and I have invented a cloth which is not only very beautiful but is also magic. We wondered if Your Majesty might be interested in such a cloth.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">'Magic?' said the Emperor pretending not to be very interested. 'What magic?'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Emperor sat up very straight. 'This is brilliant,' he thought. 'Here's a chance to find out which of my people are fit for their jobs and which of them are fools.'</div>

<div class="line_en">'It's not cheap,' said the tall stranger. 'It'll cost...</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now the Emperor would never miss a chance to buy unusual clothes, so before long the two strangers were standing in front of the great man and his ministers, all eager to see what the two had brought.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">'Alright,' he said. 'Make me some of your magic cloth. Make it for me now.'</div>

<div class="line_en">'Good,' he said. 'They've made a start.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">'It doesn't matter what it costs,' said the Emperor. 'Whatever you ask I'll pay.'</div>

<div class="line_en">'Excuse me,' he said. 'May I come in?'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The strangers were given two bags of gold coins and a room where they could set up their huge wooden looms. Then they locked the door... and started to work. The Emperor listened at the door and smiled excitedly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But... what the Emperor didn't know was that these two strangers were cheats who had come to trick him. They were just pretending to work. They kept their looms moving but no silk or thread was used and not a stitch of cloth was made. The strangers looked at their empty looms and their two bags of gold and laughed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">'Enjoying their work,' said the Emperor. 'That's good sign.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For two days and two nights the Emperor listened to the strangers working and on the third day he sent his Chief Minister to see how they were getting on. The Chief Minister knocked politely on the door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The door opened.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">'Of course,' said the tall stranger. 'Come and see the magic cloth. I think you will be quite surprised.'</div>

<div class="line_en">'Like the colours?' said the tall thin stranger.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">'It's um... beautiful,' said the Chief Minister.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Well the Chief Minister was surprised. Actually the Chief Minister was horrified because what he saw hanging on the looms was... nothing. He put on his glasses, put his face right up to the loom but he could not see a single thread of cloth. 'Oh no,' he thought. 'This means that I'm a fool and that I'm not fit to do my job. No-one must know. I must pretend that I see the cloth.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">'The colours? Oh yes,' said the Chief Minister. 'Magnificent. The Emperor is going to just love those colours.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">'So what do you think?' said the short round stranger.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">'Then tell him he's going to need to pay us more money,' said the short round stranger. 'Magic thread is very expensive. Tell him we need two more bags of gold if we are to make enough cloth for a suit of clothes.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Emperor was very excited when he heard about the magnifi cent cloth and he told a servant to take the strangers two more bags of gold.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">'Certainly,' said the Chief Minister and he scurried back to the Emperor.</div>

<div class="line_en">The servant did as he was told and then took at look at the magic cloth and saw... nothing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">'Put the money on the table,' said the tall stranger pretending to work on his loom.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As he left the room and walked back to the Emperor's chamber the servant heard the chink of gold coins and the unmistakable sound of laughter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">'Lovely, isn't it,' said the short round stranger without looking up from his work. Now the servant didn't want the whole world to think he was a fool and unfit for his job so of course he said, 'Oh yes. The most beautiful cloth I have ever seen.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">News of the beautiful magic cloth quickly spread. The Emperor could wait no longer and demanded to see the cloth for himself. So, with all his ministers and his servants following behind, the Emperor went to the strangers' room and knocked on the door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Emperor looked at the looms, stared at the cloth and saw... nothing. He rubbed his eyes and looked again. Still nothing. His heart was beating. The colour had drained from his face. The cloth was invisible.</div>

</div>
<div class="line_en">And of course his ministers and servants all agreed. None of them could really see any cloth either but nobody wanted to be thought a fool so they all said, 'Magnificent... beautiful... quite, quite brilliant!'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">'This is a disaster,' he thought. 'Everyone will know I'm a fool and unfit to be Emperor. I'm finished. I'll have to resign, give up my Empire, admit I'm not up to the job.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">'Magnificent! This is the most beautiful cloth I have ever seen.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And then he thought. 'No! I'm not going to allow this to happen. I am the Emperor and I'm going to carry on being the Emperor.' And so he said...</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And then someone started to clap. Others joined in... and soon the whole court was cheering the two strangers who smiled and bowed very low like actors on a stage.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When the cheering died down the Emperor asked the two strangers if they could make him a suit of clothes from the magic cloth. The tall stranger stroked his long chin and said, 'Your Majesty, a suit of clothes made from this fi ne cloth will cost you two more bags of gold.'</div>

<div class="line_en">'Of course. Whatever. Pay them!' ordered the Emperor. So the money was paid and the two cheats got to work.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">First they squeezed him into a pair of invisible trousers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now different sounds came from the strangers' room. Peering through the keyhole the Emperor could see scissors cutting invisible cloth and needles stitching with invisible thread. He longed to see his beautiful new clothes but the Emperor knew now that they would always remain invisible to him because he was a fool. The cheating strangers worked through the night and in the morning they told the Emperor that his new clothes were ready. The Emperor was very excited and he announced that he would wear his new clothes that very morning and walk through his city so that his people could admire his latest outfit. So the Emperor got undressed and the strangers helped him on with his new clothes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">'No,' said the Emperor. 'Very comfortable. Very comfortable indeed actually.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">'Trousers not too tight, Your Majesty?' they asked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The strangers fastened invisible buttons and buckles, eased the Emperor into an invisible shirt and coat and placed an invisible hat on his head. Finally, as they tied up the invisible laces on his invisible shoes, they said, 'So how do the clothes feel, Your Majesty?'</div>

<div class="line_en">'Certainly,' said the small round stranger. 'What colour gloves shall I fetch?'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">'Very light,' said the Emperor. 'It almost feels like I'm not wearing anything at all. Now fetch me a pair of gloves. I don't want to get cold hands today.'</div>

<div class="line_en">'Purple, I think, Your Majesty,' said the tall thin stranger.</div>

<div class="line_en">The city streets were full. A great crowd had come to see the Emperor's new clothes. Everyone was excited, but they were also a bit scared. Everyone was thinking the same thought. 'What if I can't see the clothes? What if it turns out that I'm a fool?'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Emperor led the procession out of the Palace and into the streets. He walked very slowly with his head in the air and a proud smile on his face and, although the people could see no clothes, they all clapped and praised the wonderful colours and the beautiful design. 'Oh dear,' thought the Emperor. 'All my people can see my clothes. I must be the only fool in the whole city.'</div>
