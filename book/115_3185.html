<div class="line_en">Packing up. The nagging worry of departure. Lost keys, unwritten labels, tissue paper lying on the floor. I hate it all. Even now, when I have done so much of it, when I live, as the saying goes, in my boxes. Even today, when shutting drawers and flinging wide an hotel wardrobe, or the impersonal shelves of a furnished villa, is a methodical matter of routine, I am aware of sadness, of a sense of loss. Here, I say, we have lived, we have been happy. This has been ours, however brief the time. Though two nights only have been spent beneath a roof, yet we leave something of ourselves behind. Nothing material, not a hair-pin on a dressing-table, not an empty bottle of Aspirin tablets, not a handkerchief beneath a pillow, but something indefinable, a moment of our lives, a thought, a mood.</div>

<div class="line_en">This house sheltered us, we spoke, we loved within those walls. That was yesterday. Today we pass on, we see it no more, and we are different, changed in some infinitesimal way. We can never be quite the. same again. Even stopping for luncheon at a wayside inn, and going to a dark, unfamiliar room to wash my hands, the handle of the door unknown to me, the wallpaper peeling in strips, a funny little cracked mirror above the basin; for this moment, it is mine, it belongs to me. We know one another. This is the present. There is no past and no future. Here I am washing my hands, and the tracked mirror shows me to myself, suspended as it were, in time; this is me, this moment will not pass.</div>

<div class="line_en">I saw in a paper the other day that the Hotel Cote d'Azur at Monte Carlo had gone to new management, and had a different name. The rooms have been redecorated, and the whole interior changed. Perhaps Mrs Van Hopper's suite on the first floor exists no more. Perhaps there is no trace of the small bedroom that was mine. I knew I should never go back, that day I knelt on the floor and fumbled with the awkward catch of her trunk. The episode was finished, with the snapping of the lock. I glanced out of the window, and it was like turning the page of a photograph album. Those roof-tops and that sea were mine no more. They belonged to yesterday, to the past. The rooms already wore an empty air, stripped of our possessions, and there was something hungry about the suite, as though it wished us gone, and the new arrivals, who would come tomorrow, in our place. The heavy luggage stood ready strapped and locked in the corridor outside. The smaller stuff would be finished later. Waste-paper baskets groaned under litter. All her half empty medicine bottles and discarded face-cream jars, with torn-up bills and letters. Drawers in tables gaped, the bureau was stripped bare.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="前几天，我在报上看到蒙特卡洛的“蔚蓝海岸”旅馆换了经理，改了名，房间都重新布置，里面整个儿变样了。二层楼上当年范—霍珀夫人租用的那一套房间可能已经不复存在；我的那间小卧室大概连一点痕迹都没留下。那天，我跪在地上，笨手笨脚地替她的皮箱上锁，当时就有一去不返的预感。皮箱啪地一声上了锁，我也就结束这一段遐想。望望窗外，我觉得自己仿佛在影集里翻开了另外一页。远近的屋顶和大海不再归我所有，而是属于昨日，属于往昔。随身衣物收拾停当之后，房间显得空荡荡，似乎巴不得我们快走，准备明天接待新客。大件行李已捆扎就绪，上了锁就放在外面的走廊里；小件衣物还得收拾。废纸篓塞满乱七八糟的东西，快撑不住了。这里有她的药瓶（里面还装着半瓶药）、丢弃的雪花膏罐、撕碎的账单和信件。抽屉洞开着，镶镜衣柜已空空如也。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And then I open the door and go to the dining-room, where he is sitting waiting for me at a table, and I think how in that moment I have aged, passed on, how I have advanced one step towards an unknown destiny.</div>

<div class="line_en">"What an odd, unsatisfactory child you are. I can't make you out. Don't you realize that at home girls in your position without any money can have the grandest fun? Plenty of boys and excitement. All in your own class. You can have your own little set of friends, and needn't be at my beck and call as much as you are here. I thought you didn't care for Monte?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你这孩子简直荒唐，不识好歹！我真不懂你是怎么想的。你难道不知道，只有在美国，像你这种没钱没势的年轻姑娘才能过得舒心。男朋友成群，那才有劲呢！都是些和你门当户对的小伙子。你可以自己找几个朋友，也不必像现在这样成天听我使唤。我原以为你并不怎么喜欢蒙特卡洛。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She had flung a letter at me the morning before, as I poured out her coffee at breakfast. "Helen is sailing for New York on Saturday. Little Nancy has a threatened appendix, and they've cabled her to go home. That's decided me. We're going too. I'm tired to death of Europe, and we can come back in the early fall. How d'you like the idea of seeing New York?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="前一天晨餐时，我正替她斟咖啡，她丢过来一封信，并告诉我：“海伦星期六坐船去纽约。小南希可能生了阑尾炎，所以他们打电报催海伦快口去。这一来我的主意打定了，我们也马上动身。欧洲委实无聊得要命，不妨等到初秋再来，怎么样，带你观光纽约这个主意不错吧？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, you'll just have to get used to New York, that's all. We're going to catch that boat of Helen's, and it means seeing about our passage at once. Go down to the reception office right away, and make that young clerk show some sign of efficiency. Your day will be so full that you won't have time to have any pangs about leaving Monte!" She laughed disagreeably, squashing her cigarette in the butter, and went to the telephone to ring up all her friends.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那么，你就必须使自己也习惯于纽约的生活。行啦，就这么定了。我们得赶上海伦的那班船，所以立刻就得联系车票。你马上到楼下接待室跑一趟，让那小伙子办事麻利些。这一整天可够你忙的。哼，这样也好，省得你有时间为离开蒙特卡洛发愁。”她阴险地一笑，把香烟捻熄在黄油里，接着就去打电话通知朋友们。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I should say goodbye to him in the lounge, perhaps, before we left. A furtive, scrambled farewell, because of her, and there would be a pause, and a smile, and words like "Yes, of course, do write", and "I've never thanked you properly for being so kind", and "You must forward those snapshots", "What about your address?" "Well, I'll have to let you know". And he would light a cigarette casually, asking a passing waiter for a light, while I thought, "Four and a half more minutes to go. I shall never see him again."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="动身前，也许会在休息室里跟他道声再会，但因为夫人在场，仅仅只能偷偷做个仓促的表示。道别之后，也许会有短暂的沉默，接着相互一笑，说几句客套话，诸如：“当然啦，一定得来信啊！”“喔，你真客气，我可不知道怎么感谢你才好！”“务必把照片寄来啊！”“请问你的地址？”“我一定奉告，”等等，等等。接着，他若无其事地掏出烟来，招呼从身边走过的侍者送个火，而我却在一旁黯然神伤：“再过四分半钟，我就再也见不到他了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I could not face the office right away. I went into the bathroom and locked the door, and sat down on the cork mat, my head in my hands. It had happened at last, the business of going away. It was all over. Tomorrow evening I should be in the train, holding her jewel case and her rug, like a maid, and she in that monstrous new hat with the single quill, dwarfed in her fur-coat, sitting opposite me in the wagon-lit. We would wash and clean our teeth in that stuffy little compartment with the rattling doors, the splashed basin, the damp towel, the soap with a single hair on it, the carafe half-filled with water, the inevitable notice on the wall "Sous le lavabo se trouve une vase", while every rattle, every throb and jerk of the screaming train would tell me that the miles carried me away from him, sitting alone in the restaurant of the hotel, at the table I had known, reading a book, not minding, not thinking.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我没有勇气马上到接待室去办这件事，于是，就走进浴室，锁上门，双手抱头坐在软木垫毯上、事情终于发生，得准备动身了。一切都完啦！明天晚上我将坐上火车，像个女佣人一样，抱着她的首饰盒子和她在车上用的护膝毛毯。卧车车厢里，她坐在我对面的位置上，头戴其大无比的崭新女帽，上插一支孤零零的鸟羽，身子缩在毛皮上衣里。我们将在那阿塞的小房间里漱洗。因为车行震动，房门呕嘟呕嘟作声，脸盆里溅出水来。毛巾湿漉漉的；肥皂上沾着一根头发；餐桌上的饮料瓶装着半瓶水；壁上则是千篇一律的通告：“Sonslelavabosetrouveunevase①”。列车吼叫着前进，每一次哐啷，每一下震动和摇晃都在宣告，我正离他越来越远。而他呢？他也许正坐在餐厅里我熟悉的那张桌旁看书，既不想念，也不留恋——【注：①法语：盥洗盆下有便壶。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Because I was going, because it was over, there would suddenly be nothing more to say, we would be strangers, meeting for the last and only time, while my mind clamoured painfully, crying "I love you so much. I'm terribly unhappy. This has never come to me before, and never will again." My face would be set in a prim, conventional smile, my voice would be saying, "Look at that funny old man over there; I wonder who he is; he must be new here." And we would waste the last moments laughing at a stranger, because we were already strangers to one another.</div>

The panic, too, that one might cry again, the tears swelling without control, and a fatal trembling of the mouth lead one to disaster. I remember opening wide my window and leaning out, hoping the fresh morning air would blow away the tell-tale pink under the powder, and the sun had never seemed so bright, nor the day so full of promise. Monte Carlo was suddenly full of kindliness and charm, the one place in the world that held sincerity. I loved it. Affection overwhelmed me. I wanted to live there all my life. And I was leaving it today. This is the last time I brush my hair before the looking-glass, the last time I shall clean my teeth into the basin. Never again sleep in that bed. Never more turn off the switch of that electric light. There I was, padding about in a dressing-gown, making a slough of sentiment out of a commonplace hotel bedroom.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我记得那一夜把头深埋在枕头里大哭了一场，年轻姑娘辛酸的眼泪滚滚不住。那时我才二十一岁，换了今天，就不可能哭得这么伤心。那天晚上真是哭得昏天黑地，两眼红肿，咽喉干涩。早上起来，我急得要命，用海绵浸着冷水洗脸，搽花露水，偷偷地敷粉，想把夜里大哭的痕迹掩盖过去。我平时不搽粉，这么一来其实反而招眼。同时，我还怕情不自禁地再哭，嘴角抽搐几下就可能引起灾祸，引出涌泉似的泪水。我记得自己曾推开窗户，探出身子，希望早晨清新的空气能拂散脂粉底下眼圈上的红肿，别让人一看就知道我哭过。太阳似乎从来没有像今天这样明亮；白昼也从来没有像今天这样和煦晴朗。蒙特卡洛突然变得友善而妩媚，成了世间唯一诚挚待人的地方。我爱蒙特卡洛，我的心头充满着柔情。我多么希望一辈子都住在这里。可是，今天就得离开！我站在这面镜子前最后一次梳理头发；我在这脸盆里最后一次漱洗；我再也不会睡在这张床上过夜；我再也不会去扭这个开关熄灯。我穿着晨衣在这普普通通的旅馆房间里踱步，沉浸在离别的怅惘之中，不能自拔。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I hate hanging about once everything is packed," she grumbled; "we ought to have decided on the earlier train.

<div class="line_en">"Yes," I said, a dummy to her moods going into my bedroom and flinging off my dressing-gown, fastening my inevitable flannel skirt and stretching my home-made jumper over my head. My indifference to her turned to hatred. This was the end then, even my morning must be taken from me. No last half-hour on the terrace, not even ten minutes perhaps to say goodbye. Because she had finished breakfast earlier than she expected, because she was bored. Well then, I would fling away restraint and modesty, I would not be proud any more. I slammed the door of the sitting-room and ran along the passage. I did not wait for the lift, I climbed the stairs, three at a time, up to the third floor. I knew the number of his room, 148, and I hammered at the door, very flushed in the face and breathless.</div>

The situation was unreal, and I felt like a lay-figure. I wondered what he was thinking, what he was going to do. I glanced round the room, it was the, room of any man, untidy and impersonal. Lots of shoes, more than ever were needed, and strings of ties. The dressing-table was bare, except for a large bottle of hair-wash and a pair of ivory hair-brushes. No photographs. No snapshots. Nothing like that. Instinctively I had looked for them, thinking there would be one photograph at least beside his bed, or in the middle of the mantelpiece. One large one, in a leather frame.

<div class="line_en">I heard myself talking on the telephone: "Why not come down to Manderley next weekend?" People, always a throng of people. "Oh, but she's simply charming, you must meet her --" This about me, a whisper on the fringe of a crowd, and I would turn away, pretending I had not heard. Going down to the lodge with a basket on my arm, grapes and peaches for the old lady who was sick. Her hands stretched out to me, "The Lord bless you, Madam, for being so good," and my saying, "Just send up to the house for anything you want." Mrs de Winter. I would be Mrs de Winter. I saw the polished table in the dining-room, and the long candles. Maxim sitting at the end. A party of twenty-four. I had a flower in my hair. Everyone looked towards me, holding up his glass. "We must drink the health of the bride," and Maxim saying afterwards, "I have never seen you look so lovely." Great cool rooms, filled with flowers. My bedroom, with a fire in the winter, someone knocking at the door. And a woman comes in, smiling; she is Maxim's sister, and she is saying, "It's really wonderful how happy you have made him; everyone is so pleased, you are such a success." Mrs de Winter. I would be Mrs de Winter.</div>

<div class="line_en">The walls of the suite were thick, I could hear no hum of voices. I wondered what he was saying to her, how he phrased his words. Perhaps he said, "I fell in love with her, you know, the very first time we met. We've been seeing one another every day." And she in answer, "Why, Mr de Winter, it's quite the most romantic thing I've ever heard." Romantic, that was the word I had tried to remember coming up in the lift. Yes, of course. Romantic. That was what people would say. It was all very sudden and romantic. They suddenly decided to get married and there it was. Such an adventure. I smiled to myself as I hugged my knees on the window seat, thinking how wonderful it was, how happy I was going to be. I was to marry the man I loved. I was to be Mrs de Winter. It was foolish to go on having that pain in the pit of my stomach when I was so happy. Nerves of course. Waiting like this; the doctor's anteroom. It would have been better, after all, more natural surely to have gone into the sitting-room hand in hand, laughing, smiling at one another and for him to say "We're going to be married, we're very much in love."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="房间的墙相当厚实，隔壁的谈话声一点儿也听不见，他跟她说些什么呢？怎么措词？也许，他说：“您知道，第一次见面，我就爱上了她。这些日子，我们每天见面。”她的回答是：“嗬，德温特先生，这实在是我听说过的恋爱事件中最最罗曼蒂克的！”罗曼蒂克，这就是我乘电梯上楼时一路苦思而又始终没想起来的词儿。是啊，当然啦，够罗曼蒂克的！人们都会这么说。事情很突然，非常罗曼蒂克。两人一下子决定结婚，而且说到立刻做到。不啻是奇遇！在临窗的座位上，我抱着双膝，甜滋滋地对着自己笑，这一切多么美好，我将何等幸福！我要同自己心爱的男子结婚，我将成为德温特夫人！在这么幸福的时刻，居然还感到胸口发问，委实荒唐。当然，这是神经在作怪。正像在手术室前厅坐等结果。看来，如果两人手牵手一道走进起居室跟她说清楚，就更有意思，也更自然一些，两人相视一笑，一面由他站出来向她宣布：“我们决定结婚，我俩深深相爱着。”">查看中文翻译</div>

It fell open, at the title-page. "Max from Rebecca." She was dead, and one must not have thoughts about the dead. They slept in peace, the grass blew over their graves. How alive was her writing though, how full of force. Those curious, sloping letters. The blob of ink. Done yesterday. It was just as if it had been written yesterday.

I tore the page up in many little fragments and threw them into the waste-paper basket. Then I went and sat on the window seat again. But I kept thinking of the torn scraps in the basket, and after a moment I had to get up and look in the basket once more. Even now the ink stood up on the fragments thick and black, the writing was not destroyed. I took a box of matches and set fire to the fragments. The flame had a lovely light, staining the paper, curling the edges, making the slanting writing impossible to distinguish. The fragments fluttered to grey ashes. The letter R was the last to go, it twisted in the flame, it curled outwards for a moment, becoming larger than ever. Then it crumpled too; the flame destroyed it.

<div class="line_en">"H'm, h'm," she said. She took out her vanity case and began powdering her nose, "I suppose you really do know your own mind," she went on; "after all, the whole thing has been very hurried, hasn't it? A matter of a few weeks. I don't suppose he's too easy, and you'll have to adapt yourself to his ways. You've led an extremely sheltered life up to now, you know, and you can't say that I've run you off your feet. You will have your work cut out as mistress of Manderley. To be perfectly frank, my dear, I simply can't see you doing it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“—，—！”她取出化妆盒，动手往鼻子上扑粉。“想来，你作这个决定总是经过考虑的，”她接着说。“不过，事情毕竟很仓促，对吗？只有几星期的工夫。我看他这人并不怎么随和，你得改变自己的生活去适应他的习惯。你得明白，到目前为止，你一直过着非常闭塞的日子，我也没带你跑过多少地方。你今后要担负曼陀丽女主人的职责，说句老实话，亲爱的，我看你根本对付不了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She put down the box of powder, and looked at me over her shoulder. Perhaps she was being sincere at last, but I did not want that sort of honesty. I did not say anything. I looked sullen, perhaps, for she shrugged her shoulders and wandered to the looking-glass, straightening her little mushroom hat. I was glad she was going, glad I should not see her again. I grudged the months I had spent with her, employed by her, taking her money, trotting in her wake like a shadow, drab and dumb. Of course I was inexperienced, of course I was idiotic, shy, and young. I knew all that. She did not have to tell me. I suppose her attitude was deliberate, and for some odd feminine reason she resented this marriage; her scale of values had received a shock.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她放下粉盒，回头看我的脸色，也许，她终于说出真心话了，可我决不爱听这样的真心话。我抿着嘴不说话，也许表情有点阴沉，所以她只好一耸肩，往镜子跟前走去，把那顶蘑菇状的的小帽拉直。她终于要走了，我可以从此不再见到她，我打心眼里庆幸。想起与她一起度过的、受雇于她的几个月时光，我不免怨气难平：替她捧着钱袋，跟在她后面东奔西跑，像个呆板、无声的影子。确实，我没有阅历，羞怯幼稚，一个十足的傻瓜。这一切我全明白，用不着她唠叨。我看她刚才说这番话完全是有意的，因为出于某种无法解释的女性立场，她恨这桩婚事，她对于人们各种价值的估计，由此遭到了当头一棒。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Well, I would not care, I would forget her and her barbed words. A new confidence had been born in me when I burnt that page and scattered the fragments. The past would not exist for either of us; we were starting afresh, he and I. The past had blown away like the ashes in the waste-paper basket. I was going to be Mrs de Winter. I was going to live at Manderley.</div>

<div class="line_en">Soon she would be gone, rattling alone in the wagon-lit without me, and he and I would be together in the dining-room of the hotel, lunching at the same table, planning the future. The brink of a big adventure. Perhaps, once she had gone, he would talk to me at last, about loving me, about being happy. Up to now there had been no time, and anyway those things are not easily said, they must wait their moment. I looked up, and caught her reflection in the looking-glass. She was watching me, a little tolerant smile on her lips. I thought she was going to be generous after all, hold out her hand and wish me luck, give me encouragement and tell me that everything was going to be all right. But she went on smiling, twisting a stray hair into place beneath her hat.</div>
