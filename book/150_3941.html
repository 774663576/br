<div class="line_en">Walter did not come back to dinner that evening. Kitty waited for him a little, for when he was detained in the city he always managed to send her word, but at last she sat down. She made no more than a pretence of eating the many courses which the Chinese cook, with his regard for propriety notwithstanding pestilence and the difficulty of provisioning, invariably set before her; and then, sinking into the long rattan chair by the open window, surrendered herself to the beauty of the starry night. The silence rested her.</div>

<div class="line_en">She did not try to read. Her thoughts floated upon the surface of her mind like little white clouds reflected on a still lake. She was too tired to seize upon one, follow it up and absorb herself in its attendant train. She wondered vaguely what there was for her in the various impressions which her conversations with the nuns had left upon her. It was singular that, though their way of life so profoundly moved her, the faith which occasioned it left her untouched. She could not envisage the possibility that she might at any time be captured by the ardour of belief. She gave a little sigh: perhaps it would make everything easier if that great white light should illuminate her soul. Once or twice she had had the desire to tell the Mother Superior of her unhappiness and its cause; but she dared not: she could not bear that this austere woman should think ill of her. To her what she had done would naturally seem a grievous sin. The odd thing was that she herself could not regard it as wicked so much as stupid and ugly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她不想拿出书来读。这时的思绪就像平静湖面上白云的倒影，在她思想的表面浮来浮去。她太累了，一个念头也不想抓住，更不想把来龙去脉弄个究竟。她只是模模糊糊地在想这些天来在与修女的交谈中悟出了什么没有。显而易见的是，她虽然被她们的苦行生活深深地打动了，但是支持她们如此行事的信仰，她是不以为然的。她不敢想她也会有被信仰的烈火烧着的时候。她不禁短叹一声：如果那伟大的圣洁之光也来照耀她的灵魂，也许所有的事情都会迎刃而解。曾经有一两回，她忍不住要把自己的不幸遭遇及前因后果一五一十地说给修道院长听，但是她又没那个胆量，要是这位严肃的女人因此把凯蒂想成个放荡女子，那可不是她能受得了的。对修道院长来说，她的所作所为已经算是罪大恶极了。奇怪的是，在凯蒂自己看来，顶多也不过是愚蠢、丢人之举，哪里谈得上罪恶呢？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And the future? It was curious how indifferent it left her; she could not see into it at all. Perhaps she would die when the baby was born. Her sister Doris had always been much stronger than she, and Doris had nearly died. (She had done her duty and produced an heir to the new baronetcy; Kitty smiled as she thought of her mother's satisfaction.) If the future was so vague it meant perhaps that she was destined never to see it. Walter would probably ask her mother to take care of the child -- if the child survived; and she knew him well enough to be sure that, however uncertain of his paternity, he would treat it with kindness. Walter could be trusted under any circumstances to behave admirably. It was a pity that with his great qualities, his unselfishness and honour, his intelligence and sensibility, he should be so unlovable. She was not in the least frightened of him now, but sorry for him, and at the same time she could not help thinking him slightly absurd. The depth of his emotion made him vulnerable and she had a feeling that somehow and at some time she so could work upon it as to induce him to forgive her. The thought haunted her now that in thus giving him peace of mind she would make the only possible amends for the anguish she had caused him. It was a pity he had so little sense of humour: she could see them both, some day, laughing together at the way they had tormented themselves.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="还有，将来怎么办？她已经被将来无情地抛弃了，今后的日子怎么走她一点影子也看不到。或许她生小孩的时候就会难产死去。她的妹妹多丽丝身板儿比她结实，可分娩的时候差点丢了性命。（她给准男爵添置了一位小继承人，终于算是功德圆满了，妈妈也一定是心满意足。想到这儿凯蒂又微笑起来。）将来对她来说太难以捉摸了，或许她这辈子都甭想预知自己的命运。瓦尔特很可能把孩子交给她妈妈抚养——如果孩子能活下来的话。而且以她对他的了解，虽然孩子的父亲是谁还不确定，但他一定会把这个新生命当成心肝宝贝来百般疼爱。瓦尔特是那种什么情况下都能指望他办善事的人。不过遗憾的是，虽然他医术高明，大公无私，广受称赞，同时又聪明睿智，体贴周到，她却始终不能爱他。现在她一点也不害怕他了，只是对他心中有愧。但他还是有根足够荒唐的脑筋。他把感情投入得太深，因此也更容易受到伤害。她觉得有朝一日她可以利用这一点诱使瓦尔特原谅自己。她现在常常想，等他原谅了她的时候，她一定不惜任何代价来弥补她犯下的过错。他的幽默感少得可怜，这不免是个小小的遗憾。她似乎已经看到了某一天他们会为自己曾经自寻烦恼而大笑不已。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Perhaps it was due to an obtuseness in herself that she looked upon her connexion with Townsend as regrettable and shocking even, but to be forgotten rather than to be repented of. It was like making a blunder at a party; there was nothing to do about it, it was dreadfully mortifying, but it showed a lack of sense to ascribe too much importance to it. She shuddered as she thought of Charlie with his large frame too well covered, the vagueness of his jaw and the way he had of standing with his chest thrown out so that he might not seem to have a paunch.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她曾经后悔对唐生投怀送抱，为之震惊、羞耻也有过，现在看来那是她太糊涂罢了。那件事就应该像丢垃圾一样从她的脑子里清理出去，在它上面后悔不迭就太不值得了。这就和在晚会上说错了话一样，你根本不必为此久久不能释怀。不错，那的确是够难堪够丢人的，但事情一过，就应该把它彻底忘掉。想到查理她又不禁颤抖了一下。他庞大的身架总是穿着过于矫饰的礼服，下巴又宽又大。瞧他的站相，拼命把胸挺起来，好像这样别人就看不见他的大肚子似的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">His sanguine temperament showed itself in the little red veins which soon would form a network on his ruddy cheeks. She had liked his bushy eye-brows: there was to her in them now something animal and repulsive.</div>
