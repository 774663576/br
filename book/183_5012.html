His white hair was crowned with a chaplet of oak leaves, his beard fell to his girdle, and he supported himself with a curiously carved staff. When he saw Aslan he bowed low and said,</div>

<div class="line_en">"No," said the Magician, "they are very stupid but there is no real harm in them. I begin to grow rather fond of the creatures. Sometimes, perhaps, I am a little impatient, waiting for the day when they can be governed by wisdom instead of this rough magic."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Nay," said the Lion, with a little half-growl that meant (Lucy thought) the same as a laugh. "I should frighten them out of their senses. Many stars will grow old and come to take their rest in islands before your people are ripe for that. And today before sunset I must visit Trumpkin the Dwarf where he sits in the castle of Cair Paravel counting the days till his master Caspian comes home. I will tell him all your story, Lucy. Do not look so sad. We shall meet soon again."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“真可爱。”露茜说，可不是吗：一份滚烫的煎蛋卷、冷羊肉、绿豌豆、一份草莓冰淇淋、柠檬汽水作佐餐饮料，随后还有一杯巧克力。可是魔法师本人只喝酒，只吃面包。他一点也不让人觉得惊恐不安，露茜跟他很快就像老朋友似的闲聊开了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, that's rather a delicate question," said the Magician. "You see, it's only they who think they were so nice to look at before. They say they've been uglified, but that isn't what I called it. Many people might say the change was for the better."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“是啊——可以说，没有他的话我们日子会更好过些。当然，我能把他变成别的东西，或者对他念一种咒语，使他们对他一句话都不信。可是我不愿意这么做。还是让他们钦佩他吧，总比对谁都不钦佩好。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, they wouldn't do what they were told. Their work is to mind the garden and raise food -- not for me, as they imagine, but for themselves. They wouldn't do it at all if I didn't make them. And of course for a garden you want water. There is a beautiful spring about half a mile away up the hill. And from that spring there flows a stream which comes right past the garden. All I asked them to do was to take their water from the stream instead of trudging up to the spring with their buckets two or three times a day and tiring themselves out besides spilling half of it on the way back. But they wouldn't see it. In the end they refused point blank."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“说起来，他们不愿干我叫他们干的活儿。他们的活儿就是照料照料花园，种种粮食——不是像他们想像的为我，而是为他们自己。如果我不逼他们干，他们根本就不愿干。照料花园当然少不了水。山上约莫半英里外有个美丽的山泉，有条小溪从那山泉一直流过花园。我只要他们从这条小溪里取水就行了，用不着他们一天两三回提着水桶，辛辛苦苦爬上山泉去打水，筋疲力尽回来，还不说路上洒掉了一半。可是他们死也不明白，到末了他们干脆拒绝不干了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The things she pointed at were dotted all over the level grass. They were certainly very like mushrooms, but far too big -- the stalks about three feet high and the umbrellas about the same length from edge to edge. When she looked carefully she noticed too that the stalks joined the umbrellas not in the middle but at one side which gave an unbalanced look to them. And there was something -- a sort of little bundle -- lying on the grass at the foot of each stalk. In fact the longer she gazed at them the less like mushrooms they appeared. The umbrella part was not really round as she had thought at first. It was longer than it was broad, and it widened at one end. There were a great many of them, fifty or more.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她指的是铺满平坦的草地的东西。的确很像蘑菇，可是要大得多——蘑菇柄约三英尺高，蘑菇盖直径也有这么长。她仔细一看，才看出蘑菇的柄和盖不是在当中连接，而是偏在一边，看上去不对称。每根蘑菇柄根部都有什么东西——一种小包袱似的——躺在草地上。其实这些东西越看越不像蘑菇。正如她开头所想的，盖子部分并不真是圆的，直里比横里长，一头宽。有好多个呢。大约有五十多个。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They went into another room which was full of polished instruments hard to understand -- such as Astrolabes, Orreries, Chronoscopes, Poesimeters, Choriambuses and Theodolinds -- and here, when they had come to the window, the Magician said, "There. There are your Duffers."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们走进另外一间房间，里面全是叫人搞不明白的仪表器具，擦得铮亮——比如测定天体位置的星盘、太阳系仪、测量速度的瞬时计、诗行计算表、诗律计算表，经纬仪等等——他们走到窗口，魔法师说：“瞧，这就是你要看的笨蛋。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Magician sighed. "You wouldn't believe the troubles I've had with them. A few months ago they were all for washing up the plates and knives before dinner: they said it saved time afterwards. I've caught them planting boiled potatoes to save cooking them when they were dug up. One day the cat got into the dairy and twenty of them were at work moving all the milk out; no one thought of moving the cat. But I see you've finished. Let's go and look at the Duffers now they can be looked at."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="魔法师叹了口气：“他们给我惹的麻烦，说了你也不会相信。两三个月前，饭前他们就都去洗餐盘和刀子，他们说这可以节约时间，免得饭后再洗。有一回他们在刨地，我碰见他们在种煮熟的土豆，说是免得吃时再煮。有一天猫溜进了牛奶房，他们就出动二十个人把牛奶搬出来；竟没人想到把猫赶出来。啊，我看你吃完了。我们就去看看这些笨蛋现在的模样吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Instantly a most extraordinary thing happened. Each of the "mushrooms" suddenly turned upside-down. The little bundles which had lain at the bottom of the stalks were heads and bodies. The stalks themselves were legs. But not two legs to each body. Each body had a single thick leg right under it (not to one side like the leg of a one-legged man) and at the end of it, a single enormous foot-a broadtoed foot with the toes curling up a little so that it looked rather like a small canoe. She saw in a moment why they had looked like mushrooms. They had been lying flat on their backs each with its single leg straight up in the air and its enormous foot spread out above it. She learned afterwards that this was their ordinary way of resting; for the foot kept off both rain and sun and for a Monopod to lie under its own foot is almost as good as being in a tent.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="顿时出现了一件离奇透顶的事。每一只“蘑菇”忽然一下子都颠倒过来了。连在根部的那小包袱原来是脑袋和身子，柄原来是腿，但不是每个身子长着两条腿。每个身子下面只长着一条粗腿，而且不像一条腿的人那样长在一边，腿下端是一只其大无比的脚——一只粗脚趾的脚，脚趾略为翘起，看上去活像一只小小的独木舟。她一会儿就明白他们为什么看上去像蘑菇了。他们一直仰天平躺在地上，每个人都把那条独腿直挺挺朝天伸着，大脚正好在身子上面伸开。事后她才知道这是他们通常休息的方式；因为这只脚又遮雨又遮太阳，独脚怪躺在自己脚下面几乎跟躺在帐篷里一样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And before everyone went to bed that evening something else happened which made them even more satisfied with their one-legged condition. Caspian and all the Narnians went back as soon as possible to the shore to give their news to Rhince and the others on board the Dawn Treader, who were by now very anxious. And, of course, the Monopods went with them, bouncing like footballs and agreeing with one another in loud voices till Eustace said, "I wish the Magician would make them inaudible instead of invisible." (He was soon sorry he had spoken because then he had to explain that an inaudible thing is something you can't hear, and though he took a lot of trouble he never felt sure that the Monopods had really understood, and what especially annoyed him was that they said in the end, "Eh, he can't put things the way our Chief does. But you'll learn, young man. Hark to him. He'll show you how to say things. There's a speaker for you!") When they reached the bay, Reepicheep had a brilliant idea. He had his little coracle lowered and paddled himself about in it till the Monopods were thoroughly interested. He then stood up in it and said, "Worthy and intelligent Monopods, you do not need boats. Each of you has a foot that will do instead. Just jump as lightly as you can on the water and see what happens."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天晚上大家临睡前又出了些事，使他们对自己的独脚现状更加满足了。凯斯宾和全体纳尼亚人尽快回到岸边，向赖因斯和黎明踏浪号上的其他人通报消息，当时他们都急坏了。不消说，那些独脚怪当然也跟他们一起去，一面像足球似的蹦蹦跳跳，一面互相大声一唱一和，直到尤斯塔斯说了句：“我真希望魔法师不是把他们变成隐身人，而是变成无声人。”（他说完马上就后悔了，因为这时他不得不向他们说明无声就是让别人听不见他们的声音，尽管他费了不少唇舌，他还是一点也拿不准独脚怪是不是真听明白了，尤其使他恼火的是他们临了竟说：“呃，他不能像我们的头儿那样要怎样就怎样。不过你会知道的，年轻人。听听头儿说话吧。他会教你怎么说话。你瞧，多会说话的人呀！”）当大家来到海滩边，雷佩契普想到一个绝妙的主意。它早已放下自己的小筏子，还坐在里面亲自划桨，独脚怪看得大感兴趣。于是它在筏子里站起来说：“尊敬而聪明的独脚先生，你们用不着小船。你们每个人都有一只脚可以当船用。只要尽量轻巧地在水面上跳，再瞧瞧怎么着就是了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Duffers were also very pleased with their new name of Monopods, which seemed to them a magnificent name though they never got it right. "That's what we are," they bellowed, "Moneypuds, Pomonods, Poddymons. Just what it was on the tips of our tongues to call ourselves." But they soon got it mixed up with their old name of Duffers and finally settled down to calling themselves the Dufflepuds; and that is what they will probably be called for centuries.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那些笨蛋对自己有了独脚怪的新名称也非常高兴，虽然他们根本念不准音，可是在他们心目中这似乎是个了不起的名称。“我们就叫这个，”他们大吼大叫道，“独角怪，怪独角，角怪独。我们称呼自己的叫法就在舌尖上。”可是转眼工夫他们就把这叫法跟老叫法“笨蛋”搞混了，叫着叫着最后竟叫定了，自称为“笨蛋瓜”：这名称大概还要叫上好几百年吧。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Chief Monopod hung back and warned the others that they'd find the water powerful wet, but one or two of the younger ones tried it almost at once; and then a few others followed their example, and at last the whole lot did the same. It worked perfectly. The huge single foot of a Monopod acted as a natural raft or boat, and when Reepicheep had taught them how to cut rude paddles for themselves, they all paddled about the bay and round the Dawn Treader, looking for all the world like a fleet of little canoes with a fat dwarf standing up in the extreme stern of each. And they had races, and bottles of wine were lowered down to them from the ship as prizes, and the sailors stood leaning over the ship's sides and laughed till their own sides ached.</div>

<div class="line_en">That evening all the Narnians dined upstairs with the Magician, and Lucy noticed how different the whole top floor looked now that she was no longer afraid of it. The mysterious signs on the doors were still mysterious but now looked as if they had kind and cheerful meanings, and even the bearded mirror now seemed funny rather than frightening. At dinner everyone had by magic what everyone liked best to eat and drink, and after dinner the Magician did a very useful and beautiful piece of magic. He laid two blank sheets of parchment on the table and asked Drinian to give him an exact account of their voyage up to date: and as Drinian spoke, everything he described came out on the parchment in fine clear lines till at last each sheet was a splendid map of the Eastern Ocean, showing Galma, Terebinthia, the Seven Isles, the Lone Islands, Dragon Island, Burnt Island, Deathwater, and the land of the Duffers itself, all exactly the right sizes and in the right positions. They were the first maps ever made of those seas and better than any that have been made since without magic. For on these, though the towns and mountains looked at first just as they would on an ordinary map, when the Magician lent them a magnifying glass you saw that they were perfect little pictures of the real things, so that you could see the very castle and slave market and streets in Narrowhaven, all very clear though very distant, like things seen through the wrong end of a telescope. The only drawback was that the coastline of most of the islands was incomplete, for the map showed only what Drinianhad seen with his own eyes. When they were finished the. Magician kept one himself and presented the other to Caspian: it still hangs in his Chamber of Instruments at Cair Paravel. But the Magician could tell them nothing about seas or lands further east. He did, however, tell them that about seven years before a Narnian ship had put in at his waters and that she had on board the lords Revilian, Argoz, Mavramorn and Rhoop: so they judged that the golden man they had seen lying in Deathwater must be the Lord Restimar.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天晚上，全体纳尼亚客人都在楼上同魔法师共进晚餐，露茜注意到整个楼上大变样了，现在她不再害怕了。门上的神秘符号还是怪神秘的，可是现在看上去好像也是善意可亲，甚至长胡子的镜子现在看上去也不吓人，而是滑稽有趣了。席间，大家都靠魔法的法力，尝到自己最喜爱的食品和饮料。饭后，魔法师又使出一件非常实用而精彩的魔法。他在桌上铺了两张空白的羊皮纸，要求德里宁向他精确讲述直到目前的全部航程：德里宁一边讲，纸上一边就线条清晰地显出他讲的一切细节，最后每张纸都成了一幅绝妙的东洋地图，标出了加尔马、特里宾西亚、七群岛、孤独群岛、龙岛、火烧岛、死水岛和笨蛋居住的地方，尺寸大小、位置方向都丝毫不差。这是那片海域破天荒第一次制作的地图，比此后不施魔法制作的好得多。因为这两张地图上面标着的城镇和山脉虽然初看之下和普通地图一模一样，可是魔法师借给他们一个放大镜后，看出来就是活灵活现的真实原物的雏型了，（啊呀就跟五十年后，现在的谷歌卫星地图似的。）所以你能看见狭港那个城堡和奴隶市场，还有街道，虽然很远，却很清晰，就跟用望远镜另一头望出来的事物一样。惟一缺陷是大部分岛屿的海岸线都是不完整的，因为地图只能根据德里宁亲眼看到的来标明。等到地图完成，魔法师就自己留下一幅，把另一幅送给凯斯宾，这幅地图至今仍然挂在凯尔帕拉维尔仪器馆里。不过魔法师也无法告诉他们再往东去那里海洋和陆地的情况。然而，他倒是告诉他们，七年前有一艘纳尼亚船开进他这里的海面，船上有雷维廉、阿尔戈兹、马夫拉蒙、罗普几位爵爷，所以他们推断他们看见躺在死水里的金人一定是雷斯蒂玛爵爷。">查看中文翻译</div>
