<div class="line_en">Pantalaimon became a wildcat and scanned the dark all around with his night-piercing eyes. Every so often he'd stop, bristling, and she would turn aside from the entrance she'd been about to go down. The night was full of noises: bursts of drunken laughter, two raucous voices raised in song, the clatter and whine of some badly oiled machine in a basement. Lyra walked delicately through it all, her senses magnified and mingled with Pantalaimon's, keeping to the shadows and the narrow alleys.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a fine thing to be free again. She knew that Pantalaimon, padding on wildcat paws beside her, felt the same joy as she did to be in the open air, even if it was murky London air laden with fumes and soot and clangorous with noise. Sometime soon they'd have to think over the meaning of what they'd heard in Mrs. Coulter's flat, but not yet. And sometime eventually they'd have to find a place to sleep.</div>

<div class="line_en">At a crossroads near the corner of a big department store whose windows shone brilliantly over the wet pavement, there was a coffee stall: a little hut on wheels with a counter under the wooden flap that swung up like an awning.

<div class="line_en">On and on she walked, and the streets became darker and emptier. It was drizzling, but even if there'd been no clouds the city sky was too tainted with light to show the stars. Pantalaimon thought they were going north, but who could tell?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她走来走去，街道变得越来越黑，越来越空。虽然下着毛毛雨，但即使没有云彩，城市的天空也被光线照射得无法显示星星。潘特莱蒙以为他们要往北走，但谁知道呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Endless streets of little identical brick houses, with gardens only big enough for a dustbin; great gaunt factories behind wire fences, with one anbaric light glowing bleakly high up on a wall and a night watchman snoozing by his brazier; occasionally a dismal oratory, only distinguished from a warehouse by the crucifix outside. Once she tried the door of one of these places, only to hear a groan from the bench a foot away in the darkness. She realized that the porch was full of sleeping figures, and fled.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="街道两旁排列着建筑风格相同的小巧的砖房，一眼望不到头，房前的花园只放得下一个垃圾箱；铁丝网后面是庞大但又了无生气的工厂，一盏电灯挂在高高的墙头上，冷冰冰地照着，一个守夜人在自己的火盆旁边打着盹儿；偶尔会碰上一座凄凉的小教堂，上面的十字架是它跟仓库的惟一区别。有一次，莱拉试着推了推其中的一扇门，只听到一英尺远的黑暗中的板凳上传来一阵哼哼声。她明白了，门廊里已经睡满了人，于是便逃走了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Where we going to sleep, Pan?" she said as they trudged down a street of closed and shuttered shops.</div>

<div class="line_en">He was looking down a side road to the left. Sure enough, a patch of dark glimmer showed open water, and when they cautiously went to look, they found a canal basin where a dozen or so barges were tied up at the wharves, some high in the water, some low and laden under the gallows-like cranes. A dim light shone in one window of a wooden hut, and a thread of smoke rose from the metal chimney; otherwise the only lights were high up on the wall of the warehouse or the gantry of a crane, leaving the ground in gloom. The wharves were piled with barrels of coal spirit, with stacks of great round logs, with rolls of cauchuc-covered cable.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他正在朝左侧的一条小道下面张望。的确，有一个地方在黑暗中闪着亮光，这说明那里有水。他们小心翼翼走过去，发现是运河上的一个水湾，码头上拴着十几条驳船，有的高高地漂浮在水面，有的在绞刑架般的吊车下因载重很多而吃水很深。从一个小木屋的窗户里透出一点微光，一缕清烟从金属烟囱里袅袅升起。除了这一点灯光之外，就只有仓库墙壁和高高的吊车托台上的灯光了，使得地面上显得非常暗淡。码头上堆满了一桶桶煤油、一堆堆巨大的圆木和一卷卷套着胶皮的电缆。">查看中文翻译</div>
