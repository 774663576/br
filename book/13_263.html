<div class="line_en">"Gandalf, Gandalf!" cried Pippin, and Shadowfax halted.</div>

<div class="line_en">"What are you doing here?" said Gandalf. "Is it not a law in the City that those who wear the black and silver must stay in the Citadel, unless their lord gives them leave?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你在这里干什么？”甘道夫问道：“城里的律法不是规定穿着黑银制服的人，必须留在要塞里面，只有在王上下令时才能离开？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He has," said Pippin. "He sent me away. But I am frightened. Something terrible may happen up there. The Lord is out of his mind, I think. I am afraid he will kill himself, and kill Faramir too. Can't you do something?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他颁下命令，”皮聘说：“他赶我离开，可是我觉得很害怕，上面可能会发生糟糕的事情，我想城主疯了。我担心他会自杀，也一起将法拉墨杀死，你能做些什么吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When the dark shadow at the Gate withdrew Gandalf still sat motionless. But Pippin rose to his feet, as if a great weight had been lifted from him; and he stood listening to the horns, and it seemed to him that they would break his heart with joy. And never in after years could he hear a horn blown in the distance without tears starting in his eyes. But now suddenly his errand returned to his memory, and he ran forward. At that moment Gandalf stirred and spoke to Shadowfax, and was about to ride through the Gate.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当正门的魔影退却之后，甘道夫却依然动也不动地骑在马上，皮聘把握机会站起来，觉得似乎卸下了千斤重担。他倾听着号角声，觉得天下再也没有比它更美妙的音乐，小心脏高兴得彷佛会因此而爆开。在那之后，每次只要一听见号角声，他就有种热泪盈眶的冲动。不过这时，他突然想起此行的任务，于是赶忙跑向前；就在那一刻，甘道夫动了动，弯身和影疾说话，似乎正准备奔出正门。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Gandalf looked through the gaping Gate, and already on the fields he heard the gathering sound of battle. He clenched his hand. "I must go," he said. "The Black Rider is abroad, and he will yet bring ruin on us. I have no time."</div>

<div class="line_en">"But Faramir!" cried Pippin. "He is not dead, and they will burn him alive, if someone does not stop them."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那法拉墨怎么办？”皮聘大喊着：“他还没死，如果没人阻止他们，他们会把他活活烧死的！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then having made up his mind he acted swiftly; and catching up Pippin and setting him before him, he turned Shadowfax with a word. Up the climbing streets of Minas Tirith they clattered, while the noise of war rose behind them. Everywhere men were rising from their despair and dread, seizing their weapons, crying one to another: "Rohan has come!" Captains were shouting, companies were mustering; many already were marching down to the Gate.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他下定决心，立刻付诸行动。甘道夫一把抓起皮聘，将他放在身前，命令影疾调转头。他们飞奔而上米那斯提力斯的街道，身后战斗的声音也越来越大。两人所到之处，每个人都正挣扎着从绝望和恐惧中站直身，拿起武器，扯开喉咙大喊：“骠骑终于来了！”将军们在发号施令，各处都有部队集结，已经有人开始朝向正门冲去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Denethor has gone to the Tombs," said Pippin, "and he has taken Faramir, and he says we are all to burn, and he will not wait, and they are to make a pyre and burn him on it, and Faramir as well. And he has sent men to fetch wood and oil. And I have told Beregond, but I'm afraid he won't dare to leave his post: he is on guard. And what can he do anyway?" So Pippin poured out his tale, reaching up and touching Gandalf's knee with trembling hands. "Can't you save Faramir?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“迪耐瑟去了陵寝，”皮聘说：“他把法拉墨一起带过去，对我们说大家都会被烧死，他不愿意继续等，他命令仆人堆起火葬堆，把他和法拉墨一起烧死在上面。他已经派人去找柴火和油了，我告诉贝瑞贡，但我担心他不敢离开岗位，他正在站岗。他又能怎么做呢？”皮聘一口气把经过全都说完，伸出颤抖的手，抓住甘道夫的膝盖说：“请你救救法拉墨！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“活活烧死？”甘道夫质问道：“这是怎么一回事？快点说！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Maybe I can," said Gandalf; "but if I do, then others will die, I fear. Well, I must come, since no other help can reach him. But evil and sorrow will come of this. Even in the heart of our stronghold the Enemy has power to strike us: for his will it is that is at work."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“或许我可以，”甘道夫说：“如果我这么做，我担心会有其他人因此逝去。好吧！既然别无选择，我必须前往伸出援手，但这会带来哀伤和悲惨的结果。没想到连在我们最坚强的堡垒中，魔王也可以打击我们，这背后一定是他的意志在运作。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At the gate of the Citadel they found no guard. "Then Beregond has gone," said Pippin more hopefully. They turned away and hastened along the road to the Closed Door. It stood wide open, and the porter lay before it. He was slain and his key had been taken.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们在要塞门口没有遇上任何卫兵。“那么贝瑞贡已经走了，”皮聘燃起希望，两人转过头，沿着小路来到封印之门前。门敝开着，看门人倒在旁边，他被杀死，而钥匙也被拿走了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They passed on; and as they climbed and drew near to the Citadel they felt the wind blowing in their faces, and they caught the glimmer of morning far away, a light growing in the southern sky. But it brought little hope to them, not knowing what evil lay before them, fearing to come too late.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们继续冲向前。要塞的距离越来越近，他们可以感觉到微风吹拂在脸上，遥远南方的曙光正逐渐揭露。但这无法带来希望，他们不知道眼前会是什么样的景象，只担心自己来得太迟。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You will need every man and more," said Gandalf. "Make all haste. I will come when I can. But I have an errand to the Lord Denethor that will not wait. Take command in the Lord's absence!"</div>

<div class="line_en">They met the Prince Imrahil, and he called to them: "Whither now, Mithrandir? The Rohirrim are fighting on the fields of Gondor! We must gather all the strength that we can find."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Work of the Enemy!" said Gandalf. "Such deeds he loves: friend at war with friend; loyalty divided in confusion of hearts." Now he dismounted and bade Shadowfax return to his stable. "For, my friend," he said, "you and I should have ridden to the fields long ago, but other matters delay me. Yet come swiftly if I call!"</div>

<div class="line_en">They passed the Door and walked on down the steep winding road. Light was growing, and the tall columns and carven figures beside the way went slowly by like grey ghosts.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两人走过大门，来到蜿蜒的道路上，两旁高大的石柱和雕像有如灰色鬼魂般地缓缓掠过。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Even as Gandalf and Pippin ran forward, they heard from within the house of the dead the voice of Denethor crying: "Haste, haste! Do as I have bidden! Slay me this renegade! Or must I do so myself?" Thereupon the door which Beregond held shut with his left hand was wrenched open, and there behind him stood the Lord of the City, tall and fell; a light like flame was in his eyes, and he held a drawn sword.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在甘道夫和皮聘拚命狂奔的时候，他们可以听见陵寝中传来迪耐瑟的嘶吼声：“快点，快点！照我说的做！杀死这个叛徒！难道我必须自己动手吗？”贝瑞贡用左手挡住的门被拉开了，城主站在他面前，高大而疯狂，眼中有着可怕的怒火，手上拿着出鞘的宝剑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For there were the servants of Denethor with swords and torches in their hands; but alone in the porch upon the topmost step stood Beregond, clad in the black and silver of the Guard; and he held the door against them. Two of them had already fallen to his sword, staining the hallows with their blood; and the others cursed him, calling him outlaw and traitor to his master.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="门前是迪耐瑟的仆人，手中拿着剑和火把；穿着黑银制服的贝瑞贡，则是单枪匹马地站在门前，不准这些人进入。已经有两名仆人被他所杀，让这圣地沾染了他们的血液；其他人不停地咒骂他，诅咒他是叛徒，不肯效忠王上的命令。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Suddenly the silence was broken, and they heard below them cries and the ringing of swords: such sounds as had not been heard in the hallowed places since the building of the City. At last they came to Rath Dínen and hastened towards the House of the Stewards, looming in the twilight under its great dome.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然间，寂静被打破了，他们听见底下传来刀剑撞击的声音。自从要塞建成之后，此地从来没传出过这种声音。好不容易，皮聘和甘道夫才来到亡者之街，两人立即冲向宰相陵寝，它在曙光中更让人有种不祥的感觉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Stay! Stay!" cried Gandalf, springing forward to the stone stair before the door. "Stay this madness!"</div>

<div class="line_en">"What is this, my lord?" said the wizard. "The houses of the dead are no places for the living. And why do men fight here in the Hallows when there is war enough before the Gate? Or has our Enemy come even to Rath Dínen?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这是怎么一回事，王上？”巫师说：“亡者居住的地方，不应该是活人嬉戏的处所。当外面战火正炽的时候，为什么你的部下要在此自相残杀？难道连拉斯迪南都沦入魔王之手了吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But Gandalf sprang up the steps, and the men fell back from him and covered their eyes; for his coming was like the incoming of a white light into a dark place, and he came with great anger. He lifted up his hand, and in the very stroke, the sword of Denethor flew up and left his grasp and fell behind him in the shadows of the house; and Denethor stepped backward before Gandalf as one amazed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此时，甘道夫跃上台阶，人们遮住双眼，不住后退；他的到来似乎替这个地方带来耀眼的白光，而他的怒气也让人不敢阻挡。他手一挥，迪耐瑟的宝剑就飞了出去，落回陵寝内。曾经权倾天下的迪耐瑟，楞楞地连退了好几步。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You may," said Gandalf. "But others may contest your will, when it is turned to madness and evil. Where is your son, Faramir?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Then Gandalf seeing the madness that was on him feared that he had already done some evil deed, and he thrust forward, with Beregond and Pippin behind him, while Denethor gave back until he stood beside the table within. But there they found Faramir, still dreaming in his fever, lying upon the table. Wood was piled under it, and high all about it, and all was drenched with oil, even the garments of Faramir and the coverlets; but as yet no fire had been set to the fuel. Then Gandalf revealed the strength that lay hid in him, even as the light of his power was hidden under his grey mantle. He leaped up on to the faggots, and raising the sick man lightly he sprang down again, and bore him towards the door. But as he did so Faramir moaned and called on his father in his dream.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="甘道夫发现他已经彻底地疯狂，很担心他做出无法挽回的事情；因此，他领着贝瑞贡和皮聘冲进去。迪耐瑟退到一旁，站在石桌旁边。他们发现法拉墨还是躺在石桌上，处在半梦半醒的高烧状态，石桌底下和旁边已经放满了柴薪，上面全是灯油，连法拉墨的衣服和被单都沾满了油，只等着火焰来吞噬一切。甘道夫展现他真正的力量，披着灰袍的他纵身一跃，将病重的法拉墨抱下来，走向门口；但是，当他这样做的时候，法拉墨发出哀号，在昏迷中叫着父亲的名字。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He calls," said Gandalf, "but you cannot come to him yet. For he must seek healing on the threshold of death, and maybe find it not. Whereas your part is to go out to the battle of your City, where maybe death awaits you. This you know in your heart."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他是叫了，”甘道夫说：“但你还不能见他，他必须在生死之间寻求解脱，也可能根本找不到出路。你的工作是出城迎战，或许是迎向自己的死亡，你自己也应该知道。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"He will not wake again," said Denethor. "Battle is vain. Why should we wish to live longer? Why should we not go to death side by side?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他不会再醒过来了，”迪耐瑟说：“战斗是徒劳无功的，我们干嘛还要苟延残喘呢？我们为何不一起离开人世？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Authority is not given to you, Steward of Gondor, to order the hour of your death," answered Gandalf. "And only the heathen kings, under the domination of the Dark Power, did thus, slaying themselves in pride and despair, murdering their kin to ease their own death." Then passing through the door he took Faramir from the deadly house and laid him on the bier on which he had been brought, and which had now been set in the porch. Denethor followed him, and stood trembling, looking with longing on the face of his son. And for a moment, while all were silent and still, watching the Lord in his throes, he wavered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“刚铎的宰相，你没有权力选择自己死亡的时间，”甘道夫回答：“只有那些堕落的君王，才会在黑暗力量的影响下，因为骄傲和绝望而自杀，或是杀死自己的血脉来陪葬。”他抱着法拉墨走出陵寝，将他放在被抬来的担架上。迪耐瑟跟在后面，浑身颤抖地站着，疼爱地望着儿子。有那么短短的一瞬间，年迈的王者挣扎着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then suddenly Denethor laughed. He stood up tall and proud again, and stepping swiftly back to the table he lifted from it the pillow on which his head had lain. Then coming to the doorway he drew aside the covering, and lo! he had between his hands a palantír. And as he held it up, it seemed to those that looked on that the globe began to glow with an inner flame, so that the lean face of the Lord was lit as with a red fire, and it seemed cut out of hard stone, sharp with black shadows, noble, proud, and terrible. His eyes glittered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然间，迪耐瑟笑了，他挺起胸膛，又露出自傲的神情。他飞快地走回之前所躺的石桌，拿起他所躺着的枕头。他走到门口，揭开枕头的布，底下竟是一颗真知晶石！当他举起晶石的时候，旁人似乎见到里面有着火焰，城主瘦削的面孔也沾染了红光，看起来像是雕像般冷酷无情。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Pride and despair!" he cried. "Didst thou think that the eyes of the White Tower were blind? Nay, I have seen more than thou knowest, Grey Fool. For thy hope is but ignorance. Go then and labour in healing! Go forth and fight! Vanity. For a little space you may triumph on the field, for a day. But against the Power that now arises there is no victory. To this City only the first finger of its hand has yet been stretched. All the East is moving. And even now the wind of thy hope cheats thee and wafts up Anduin a fleet with black sails. The West has failed. It is time for all to depart who would not be slaves."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“骄傲和绝望！”他大喊着：“你以为净白塔的眼睛瞎了吗？不，灰袍蠢汉，我看见的比你知道的还要多，希望只是无知的代名词。尽管去医治他吧！尽管去战斗吧！没用的，你们或许可以暂时赢得胜利，争取几寸土地，苟活几天，但是，要对抗这正兴起的力量？我们绝无胜算，整个东方都出动了，即使是现在，原先替你们带来希望的海风，也吹送来一整支黑色舰队。西方已经失败了，不想成为奴隶的人都该离开这里。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Hope on then!" laughed Denethor. "Do I not know thee, Mithrandir? Thy hope is to rule in my stead, to stand behind every throne, north, south, or west. I have read thy mind and its policies. Do I not know that this halfling was commanded by thee to keep silence? That he was brought hither to be a spy within my very chamber? And yet in our speech together I have learned the names and purpose of all thy companions. So! With the left hand thou wouldst use me for a little while as a shield against Mordor, and with the right bring up this Ranger of the North to supplant me. But I say to thee, Gandalf Mithrandir, I will not be thy tool! I am Steward of the House of Anárion. I will not step down to be the dotard chamberlain of an upstart. Even were his claim proved to me, still he comes but of the line of Isildur. I will not bow to such a one, last of a ragged house long bereft of lordship and dignity."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那你就继续怀抱希望吧！”迪耐瑟哈哈大笑。“米斯兰达，你以为我不了解你吗？你想要取而代之，坐上四方的宝座，统治北方、南方和西方。我已经猜到你的想法和计谋。你以为我不知道你让这半身人守口如瓶？或是没看出你把一名间谍送进我的殿堂中？但是，在我们谈话的过程中，我已经知道你所有同伴的名号。看来，你将会先用左手操弄我成为抵抗魔多的挡箭牌，然后再以右手安排这个北方游侠取而代之。甘道夫米斯兰达，我挑明了说吧！我才不愿意当你的傀儡！我是安诺瑞安家族的宰相，我才不愿让位给乳臭未干的小子，当他的下属。即使他真的拥有血统证明，也只不过是埃西铎的继承人。我才不会向这家伙低头，他只不过是个没有国度和荣耀的穷酸王族罢了！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I would have things as they were in all the days of my life," answered Denethor, "and in the days of my longfathers before me: to be the Lord of this City in peace, and leave my chair to a son after me, who would be his own master and no wizard's pupil. But if doom denies this to me, then I will have naught: neither life diminished, nor love halved, nor honour abated."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我会让一切和我这辈子的每一天都一样，”迪耐瑟回道：“以及和我之前所有的祖先一样，安心地成为城主，把我的王位留给儿子，他将会是自己的主人，不是巫师的玩物。但是，如果命运不让我这样做，那我也只能玉石俱焚：我不愿过着低下的生活，也不愿让荣誉受到挑战，更不让我受到的敬爱被分割。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At those words Denethor's eyes flamed again, and taking the Stone under his arm he drew a knife and strode towards the bier. But Beregond sprang forward and set himself before Faramir.</div>

<div class="line_en">Gandalf in grief and horror turned his face away and closed the door. For a while he stood in thought, silent upon the threshold, while those outside heard the greedy roaring of the fire within. And then Denethor gave a great cry, and afterwards spoke no more, nor was ever again seen by mortal men.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="甘道夫哀伤地转过头，关上门。他沉思片刻，门外一片死寂，门内却不停传来熊熊烈火的燃烧声。迪耐瑟惨叫一声，之后就再也没有发出任何声音，再也没有任何凡人看见过他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then Denethor leaped upon the table, and standing there wreathed in fire and smoke he took up the staff of his steward-ship that lay at his feet and broke it on his knee. Casting the pieces into the blaze he bowed and laid himself on the table, clasping the palantír with both hands upon his breast. And it was said that ever after, if any man looked in that Stone, unless he had a great strength of will to turn it to other purpose, he saw only two aged hands withering in flame.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪耐瑟跳上石桌，浑身浴火的他将脚边的宰相权杖一把折断；他将折断的权杖丢进火中，把晶石抱在胸前，在石桌上躺下来。据说从那之后，如果有任何人使用那晶石，除非他拥有极强大的意志力，否则永远只能看见一双苍老的手在火焰中缓缓燃烧。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Come hither!" he cried to his servants. "Come, if you are not all recreant!" Then two of them ran up the steps to him. Swiftly he snatched a torch from the hand of one and sprang back into the house.

<div class="line_en">"So passes Denethor, son of Ecthelion," said Gandalf. Then he turned to Beregond and the Lord's servants that stood there aghast. "And so pass also the days of Gondor that you have known; for good or evil they are ended. Ill deeds have been done here; but let now all enmity that lies between you be put away, for it was contrived by the Enemy and works his will. You have been caught in a net of warring duties that you did not weave. But think, you servants of the Lord, blind in your obedience, that but for the treason of Beregond Faramir, Captain of the White Tower, would now also be burned. Bear away from this unhappy place your comrades who have fallen. And we will bear Faramir, Steward of Gondor, to a place where he can sleep in peace, or die if that be his doom."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“爱克西里昂的儿子迪耐瑟就这么死了，”甘道夫转向贝瑞贡和呆立当场的仆人说：“你们所知的刚铎也跟着消灭了，不管是好是坏，它都结束了。这里发生过邪恶的事情，但请先把你们之间的仇恨摆到一边，因为这一切都是魔王的计谋。你们只不过是被卷入计谋中的无辜旁观者。想想，你们这些盲从的仆人，如果不是因为贝瑞贡的抗命，净白塔的将军法拉墨现在也会化成焦炭。把你们牺牲的同伴带离这个伤心地，我们会带走刚铎的宰相法拉墨，让他可以好好地休息，或是听从命运的安排静静死去。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then Gandalf and Beregond taking up the bier bore it away towards the Houses of Healing, while behind them walked Pippin with downcast head. But the servants of the Lord stood gazing as stricken men at the house of the dead; and even as Gandalf came to the end of Rath Dínen there was a great noise. Looking back they saw the dome of the house crack and smokes issue forth; and then with a rush and rumble of stone it fell in a flurry of fire; but still unabated the flames danced and flickered among the ruins. Then in terror the servants fled and followed Gandalf.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="甘道夫和贝瑞贡将担架抬往医院，皮聘低着头走在后面。城主的仆人依旧呆呆地看着眼前的陵寝，当甘道夫来到拉斯迪南的尽头时，后面传来巨大的声响。他们回头一看，看见圆顶裂开来，冒出大量的黑烟；接着轰然一声，整个圆顶垮了下来，但烈焰依旧在废墟中窜动。仆人们这才恐惧地逃离该处，跟着甘道夫。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At length they came back to the Steward's Door, and Beregond looked with grief at the porter. "This deed I shall ever rue," he said; "but a madness of haste was on me, and he would not listen, but drew sword against me." Then taking the key that he had wrested from the slain man he closed the door and locked it. "This should now be given to the Lord Faramir," he said.</div>

<div class="line_en">Now at last they passed into the high circles of the City, and in the light of morning they went their way towards the Houses of Healing; and these were fair houses set apart for the care of those who were grievously sick, but now they were prepared for the tending of men hurt in battle or dying. They stood not far from the Citadel-gate, in the sixth circle, nigh to its southward wall, and about them was a garden and a greensward with trees, the only such place in the City. There dwelt the few women that had been permitted to remain in Minas Tirith, since they were skilled in healing or in the service of the healers.</div>

<div class="line_en">But Gandalf's face was grave and sad, and bidding Beregond and Pippin to take Faramir into the Houses of Healing, he went up on to the walls nearby; and there like a figure carven in white he stood in the new sun and looked out. And he beheld with the sight that was given to him all that had befallen; and when Éomer rode out from the forefront of his battle and stood beside those who lay upon the field, he sighed, and he cast his cloak about him again, and went from the walls. And Beregond and Pippin found him standing in thought before the door of the Houses when they came out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但甘道夫的表情十分凝重、哀伤，他命贝瑞贡和皮聘抬着法拉墨进医院，自己则走到附近的城墙上，像是雕像般地在阳光下凝视战场，观察发生的事情。当伊欧墨赶去，站在父王的尸体旁时，他叹着气披上斗篷，走下城墙。贝瑞贡和皮聘走出医院时，正好看见他站在门口发呆。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But even as Gandalf and his companions came carrying the bier to the main door of the Houses, they heard a great cry that went up from the field before the Gate and rising shrill and piercing into the sky passed, and died away on the wind. So terrible was the cry that for a moment all stood still, and yet when it had passed, suddenly their hearts were lifted up in such a hope as they had not known since the darkness came out of the East; and it seemed to them that the light grew clear and the sun broke through the clouds.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当甘道夫同伴们抬着担架进入医院时，他们听见从战场上传来刺耳的尖叫声，那声音越飞越高，最后被风吹散了。这恐怖的声音让众人都不由自主地停下脚步。当声音消逝之后，所有人都觉得内心充满了数日以来睽违许久的希望；阳光似乎变得更强烈，云朵也开始逐渐散去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They looked at him, and for a while he was silent. At last he spoke. "My friends," he said, "and all you people of this city and of the Western lands! Things of great sorrow and renown have come to pass. Shall we weep or be glad? Beyond hope the Captain of our foes has been destroyed, and you have heard the echo of his last despair. But he has not gone without woe and bitter loss. And that I might have averted but for the madness of Denethor. So long has the reach of our Enemy become! Alas! but now I perceive how his will was able to enter into the very heart of the City. Though the Stewards deemed that it was a secret kept only by themselves, long ago I guessed that here in the White Tower, one at least of the Seven Seeing Stones was preserved. In the days of his wisdom Denethor would not presume to use it to challenge Sauron, knowing the limits of his own strength. But his wisdom failed; and I fear that as the peril of his realm grew he looked in the Stone and was deceived: far too often, I guess, since Boromir departed. He was too great to be subdued to the will of the Dark Power, he saw nonetheless only those things which that Power permitted him to see. The knowledge which he obtained was, doubtless, often of service to him; yet the vision of the great might of Mordor that was shown to him fed the despair of his heart until it overthrew his mind."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们看着甘道夫，双方沉默了片刻。最后，他说：“吾友们，还有所有西方大地的居民们，遗憾和光荣同时发生在这块土地上。我们该哭泣还是欢笑？敌方大将出乎意料地被毁灭了，你们听见是他最后的惨叫，但他并不是空手离开的。如果不是因为迪耐瑟的疯狂，我或许可以阻止这一切。没想到魔王竟然可以影响到这里！唉！现在我也已经猜出他的意志是怎么进入城内了。虽然宰相们认为这是只有他们知道的秘密，但我从很久以前就发现净白塔中和欧散克塔中都一样保存着七晶石之一。在迪耐瑟还保有睿智的时候，他并不敢用它，更别说挑战索伦了；因为他知道自己力量的极限。但是，他被自己蒙蔽了，随着他的国度陷入危险，他越来越常使用晶石，自从波罗莫离开后，他也多次被魔王欺骗。他的力量太强，不会屈服于黑暗之下，他所看到的只是魔王允许他看的事物，毫无疑问的，他所知道的情报往往只会让魔王随心所欲。但是，魔王一直让他尽情地观看魔多的力量，直到最后，恐惧和绝望吞没了他心中最后的理性。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Alas! then I have guessed rightly," said Gandalf. "Thus the will of Sauron entered into Minas Tirith; and thus I have been delayed here. And here I shall still be forced to remain, for I shall soon have other charges, not Faramir only. Now I must go down to meet those who come. I have seen a sight upon the field that is very grievous to my heart, and greater sorrow may yet come to pass. Come with me, Pippin! But you, Beregond, should return to the Citadel and tell the chief of the Guard there what has befallen. It will be his duty, I fear, to withdraw you from the Guard; but say to him that, if I may give him counsel, you should be sent to the Houses of Healing, to be the guard and servant of your captain, and to be at his side when he awakes -- if that shall ever be again. For by you he was saved from the fire. Go now! I shall return soon."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Now I understand what seemed so strange to me!" said Pippin, shuddering at his memories as he spoke. "The Lord went away from the room where Faramir lay; and it was only when he returned that I first thought he was changed, old and broken."</div>
