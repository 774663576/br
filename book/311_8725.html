<div class="line_en">She pulled away when the bus stopped. She never let him hold her hand once they were off the bus. She wouldn't touch him in the hallways. "People will look at us," she always said.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他问：“现在好了吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So today he stood by her locker and only thought about touching her. He wanted to tell her his news -- but she seemed so far away, he wasn't sure she'd hear him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因此，今天他站在她的储物柜旁，满脑子只想碰触她。他想跟她说禁闭解除的消息，但是她看起来很遥远，他不确定她能不能听得见。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Hey, remember that time when my mom asked if I could stay with you guys for a few days, and then she didn't come back for a year? I really appreciate the fact that you didn't turn me into Child Protective Services. That was very Christian of you. Do you still have that foldout couch?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="嗨，还记得上次我妈问能不能借住几天，结果她一年后才来接我吗？我很感激你们没把我送到儿童保护机构。真是太有基督徒精神了。请问那张折叠式沙发还在吗？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Before Richie moved in, Eleanor only knew that word from books and bathroom walls. Fucking woman. Fucking kids. Fuck you, you little bitch -- who the fuck touched my stereo?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="跟雷奇一起住以前，埃莉诺只在书本以及厕所墙上看过这个字眼。操女人。操小孩。操你个小婊子。操他妈的哪个家伙乱碰我的音响。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="上次雷奇把她踢出门时，埃莉诺丝毫没想到。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She couldn't have seen it coming because she never thought it could happen. She never thought he'd try -- and she never, ever thought her mom would go along with it. (Richie must have recognized before Eleanor did that her mother's allegiances had shifted.)</div>

<div class="line_en">She was in her room, typing song lyrics on an old manual typewriter that her mom had brought home from the Goodwill. It needed new ribbon (Eleanor had a box full of cartridges that didn't fit), but it still worked. She loved everything about that typewriter, the way the keys felt, the sticky, crunchy noise they made. She even liked the way it smelled, like metal and shoe polish.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当时她在房间里，用一台老式打字机打歌词，那是妈妈帮她从二手店弄回来的。它需要新色带（埃莉诺有一大盒色带，但都不适用），但还可以用。她很爱那台打字机，键盘的触感，以及敲下去时那种黏乎乎又脆生生的声音。她甚至喜欢它的味道，好像金属混合着鞋油。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She was bored that day, the day it happened.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="事情发生的那天，她很无聊。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was too hot to do anything but lie around or read or watch TV. Richie was in the living room. He hadn't gotten out of bed until 2:00 or 3:00, and everybody could tell he was in a bad mood. Her mom was walking around the house in nervous circles, offering Richie lemonade and sandwiches and aspirin. Eleanor hated it when her mom acted like that. Relentlessly submissive. It was humiliating to be in the same room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="天气太热，什么都做不了，只能躺着看书，或者看电视。雷奇在客厅。他一直到两三点才起床，每个人都看得出来他情绪很差。她妈妈焦虑地在屋里打转，一会儿给雷奇倒柠檬水，一会儿送三明治和阿司匹林。埃莉诺很讨厌她妈妈这样无止境地臣服。跟她待在同一个房间，看了都替她丢脸。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So Eleanor was upstairs typing song lyrics. "Scarborough Fair."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因此，埃莉诺待在楼上，打《斯卡保罗集市》的歌词。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She heard Richie complaining. "What the fuck is that noise?" And, "Fuck, Sabrina, can't you shut her up?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她听到雷奇抱怨：“那是什么鬼声音？”然后，“操，莎宾娜，你就不能叫她别吵吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Her mom tiptoed up the stairs and ducked her head into Eleanor's room. "Richie isn't feeling well," she said. "Can you put that away?" She looked pale and nervous. Eleanor hated that look.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="妈妈蹑手蹑脚地上楼，朝房内探头：“雷奇不舒服，你可以把那个收起来吗？”她脸色苍白又焦虑。埃莉诺讨厌她那种模样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Richie came up the stairs so fast, in Eleanor's head he was flying. In Eleanor's head, he burst open the door by hurling a ball of fire at it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="雷奇冲上楼，在埃莉诺的脑海里，他速度快如飞，并用火球炸开了房门。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He'd never come this close to her before. Her fear of him crushed her back. She didn't want him to see it in her eyes, so she pressed her face into her hands in her pillow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他从未离她如此之近。埃莉诺的恐惧让她全身一软，她不想让雷奇看见她眼中的恐惧，双手蒙着脸，埋进枕头里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was on her before she could brace herself, tearing the typewriter from her hands and throwing it into the wall so hard it broke through the plaster and hung for a moment in the lath.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她还来不及镇定自己，雷奇就朝她冲过来，夺过她手中的打字机，用力扔向墙壁，砸破了灰泥，一下子卡在墙壁上的板条里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Eleanor wondered if she should keep running, but where would she go? Even when she was a little girl, she never fantasized about running away. She could never imagine herself past the edge of the yard. Where would she go? Who would take her?</div>
