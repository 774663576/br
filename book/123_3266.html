<div class="line_en">The concrete highway was edged with a mat of tangled, broken, dry grass, and the grass heads were heavy with oat beards to catch on a dog's coat, and foxtails to tangle in a horse's fetlocks, and clover burrs to fasten in sheep's wool; sleeping life waiting to be spread and dispersed, every seed armed with an appliance of dispersal, twisting darts and parachutes for the wind, little spears and balls of tiny thorns, and all waiting for animals and for the wind, for a man's trouser cuff or the hem of a woman's skirt, all passive but armed with appliances of activity, still, but each possessed of the anlage of movement.</div>

<div class="line_en">The sun lay on the grass and warmed it, and in the shade under the grass the insects moved, ants and ant lions to set traps for them, grasshoppers to jump into the air and flick their yellow wings for a second, sow bugs like little armadillos, plodding restlessly on many tender feet. And over the grass at the roadside a land turtle crawled, turning aside for nothing, dragging his high-domed shell over the grass. His hard legs and yellow-nailed feet threshed slowly through the grass, not really walking, but boosting and dragging his shell along. The barley beards slid off his shell, and the clover burrs fell on him and rolled to the ground. His horny beak was partly open, and his fierce, humorous eyes, under brows like fingernails, stared straight ahead. He came over the grass leaving a beaten trail behind him, and the hill, which was the highway embankment, reared up ahead of him. For a moment he stopped, his head held high. He blinked and looked up and down. At last he started to climb the embankment. Front clawed feet reached forward but did not touch. The hind feet kicked his shell along, and it scraped on the grass, and on the gravel. As the embankment grew steeper and steeper, the more frantic were the efforts of the land turtle. Pushing hind legs strained and slipped, boosting the shell along, and the horny head protruded as far as the neck could stretch. Little by little the shell slid up the embankment until at last a parapet cut straight across its line of march, the shoulder of the road, a concrete wall four inches high. As though they worked independently the hind legs pushed the shell against the wall. The head upraised and peered over the wall to the broad smooth plain of cement. Now the hands, braced on top of the wall, strained and lifted, and the shell came slowly up and rested its front end on the wall. For a moment the turtle rested. A red ant ran into the shell, into the soft skin inside the shell, and suddenly head and legs snapped in, and the armored tail clamped in sideways. The red ant was crushed between body and legs. And one head of wild oats was clamped into the shell by a front leg. For a long moment the turtle lay still, and then the neck crept out and the old humorous frowning eyes looked about and the legs and tail came out. The back legs went to work, straining like elephant legs, and the shell tipped to an angle so that the front legs could not reach the level cement plain. But higher and higher the hind legs boosted it, until at last the center of balance was reached, the front tipped down, the front legs scratched at the pavement, and it was up. But the head of wild oats was held by its stem around the front legs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阳光照射在草地上，草地暖洋洋的，草的阴影里有各种昆虫在活动，蚂蚁和蚁狮忙着布置捕捉昆虫的陷阱，蚱蜢向空中跳起，轻轻地拍一拍翅儿，潮虫用许多细脚像犰狳一般慢腾腾地踱步。路边的草上有一只陆龟在爬行，不知怎的转向一边，拖着它那隆起的甲壳在草上走着。它那粗硬的腿和长着黄爪的脚吃力地从草丛中缓缓穿过，并不是真正在走，而是一路在推着和拖着它的甲壳前进。大麦须从它的甲壳上溜下来，苜蓿的芒刺落到它身上，又滚到地下。它那角状的尖嘴微微张着，一双凶狠而可笑的眼睛在指甲般的额头下直瞪瞪地望着前方。它爬过草地，在后面留下一条踩过的路迹，小山似的路坎却高耸在它的前面。它停了一会儿，高高地仰起头来，它眨眨眼睛，上下看了看。后来它终于开始攀登路坎了，有爪的两只前脚向前伸去，可是还够不着。两只后脚使劲把甲壳往前拱，甲壳便蹭着草，蹭着石子向前推进。路坎愈来愈陡，陆龟也愈来愈拼命加紧使劲。它那两条撑着身子前进的后腿紧张地爬着，爬几步又往下滑，勉强把甲壳往上推，脖子有多长，那角状的头便伸出多长。它的甲壳渐渐溜上了路坎，最后有一道低墙挡住了它的去路，这就是四英寸高的混凝土墙壁，公路的肩角。它的两只后腿仿佛独立行动着似的，把甲壳拱上了那道墙。它高高地抬起头来，从墙上探望那广阔平滑的水泥路面。现在它的两只前脚抓住墙顶，使劲往上挣，它的甲壳缓缓爬上来，把前半截贴在墙顶上了。乌龟休息了一会儿。一只红蚂蚁钻进了甲壳，钻进了甲壳里的软皮，于是乌龟的头和腿忽然缩进去，尾巴也向旁边一扭，缩进甲壳里。红蚂蚁在乌龟的身子和两腿之间被夹死了。一根野生燕麦梢头被它的前腿拖进了甲壳。乌龟在那里一动不动地躺了好一会儿，然后才伸出脖子，用它那双愁苦而可笑的眼睛向四周望一望，然后把腿和尾巴都伸出来。两条后腿像大象的腿一般使劲往上顶，甲壳便倾斜到一个角度，使得前腿够不着水泥的路面。但是后腿把甲壳拱得愈来愈高，终于到了平衡的中心，前半截向下一扑，两条前腿抓住了路面，于是大功告成，乌龟便上了公路了。但是那根野生燕麦的梢头仍然在它的前腿周围缠绕着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Now the going was easy, and all the legs worked, and the shell boosted along, waggling from side to side. A sedan driven by a forty-year old woman approached. She saw the turtle and swung to the right, off the highway, the wheels screamed and a cloud of dust boiled up. Two wheels lifted for a moment and then settled. The car skidded back onto the road, and went on, but more slowly. The turtle had jerked into its shell, but now it hurried on, for the highway was burning hot.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在走路容易了，它的四条腿同时并举，甲壳摇摆着，一拱一拱地向前推进。一个四十岁光景的女人开着一辆轿车渐渐驶近了。她看见了这只乌龟，便把车子往右一转，拐出了公路，车轮吱吱地叫着，掀起一阵尘沙。两个车轮有片刻工夫腾在空中，接着就着了地。车子又退回了路面，继续往前开，不过开得比原先慢些了。乌龟本已缩进甲壳，这时因为公路热得厉害，它便急忙向前爬动起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And now a light truck approached, and as it came near, the driver saw the turtle and swerved to hit it. His front wheel struck the edge of the shell, flipped the turtle like a tiddly-wink, spun it like a coin, and rolled it off the highway. The truck went back to its course along the right side. Lying on its back, the turtle was tight in its shell for a long time. But at last its legs waved in the air, reaching for something to pull it over. Its front foot caught a piece of quartz and little by little the shell pulled over and flopped upright. The wild oat head fell out and three of the spearhead seeds stuck in the ground. And as the turtle crawled on down the embankment, its shell dragged dirt over the seeds. The turtle entered a dust road and jerked itself along, drawing a wavy shallow trench in the dust with its shell. The old humorous eyes looked ahead, and the horny beak opened a little. His yellow toe nails slipped a fraction in the dust.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一会儿，又有一辆轻便卡车过来了，车子开近的时候，司机看见了乌龟，便故意兜过去要撞它。车的前轮碰着了甲壳的边缘，把乌龟像做弹圆片游戏的人弹圆片似的一弹，像旋铜币似的一旋，一下子就叫它滚到公路旁边去了。运货汽车又兜回原来靠右边的路线。乌龟脊背着地仰卧着，在甲壳里紧紧地蜷缩了好一会儿。但是最后它的四条腿终于向空中晃来晃去，想抓住什么东西，使身子翻转来。它的两只前脚终于抓住了一块石头，甲壳一点一点地翻起，终于砰地一声翻正了。那根野生燕麦梢头落了下来，于是便有三颗矛头似的种子紧粘在地里了。乌龟爬下路坎的时候，它的甲壳拖带了一些泥土，盖住了这几颗种子。乌龟爬上了一条土路，一颠一颠地向前移动，它的甲壳在尘沙里划出了一条弯弯曲曲的浅沟。它那双可笑的眼睛望着前面，角状的嘴微微张着。它那黄色的趾爪在尘沙里留下了细碎的痕迹。">查看中文翻译</div>
