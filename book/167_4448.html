<div class="line_en">The words were the same on the hundredth reading as they'd been on the first, when Sansa had discovered the folded sheet of parchment beneath her pillow. She did not know how it had gotten there or who had sent it. The note was unsigned, unsealed, and the hand unfamiliar. She crushed the parchment to her chest and whispered the words to herself. "Come to the godswood tonight, if you want to go home," she breathed, ever so faintly.</div>

<div class="line_en">What could it mean? Should she take it to the queen to prove that she was being good? Nervously, she rubbed her stomach. The angry purple bruise Ser Meryn had given her had faded to an ugly yellow, but still hurt. His fist had been mailed when he hit her. It was her own fault. She must learn to hide her feelings better, so as not to anger Joffrey. When she heard that the imp had sent Lord Slynt to the Wall, she had forgotten herself and said, "I hope the Others get him." The king had not been pleased.</div>

<div class="line_en">What if it was some cruel jape of Joffrey's, like the day he had taken her up to the battlements to show her Father's head? Or perhaps it was some subtle snare to prove she was not loyal. If she went to the godswood, would she find Ser Ilyn Payne waiting for her, sitting silent under the heart tree with Ice in his hand, his pale eyes watching to see if she'd come?</div>

<div class="line_en">Once alone, she thrust the note in the flames, watching the parchment curl and blacken. Come to the godswood tonight, if you want to go home. She drifted to her window. Below, she could see a short knight in moon-pale armor and a heavy white cloak pacing the drawbridge. From his height, it could only be Ser Preston Greenfield. The queen had given her freedom of the castle, but even so, he would want to know where she was going if she tried to leave Maegor's Holdfast at this time of night. What was she to tell him? Suddenly she was glad she had burned the note.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="独处之后，她立刻把信纸丢进火焰，看着羊皮纸卷曲焦黑。“如果你想回家，今晚请到神木林。”她挪到窗边，只见窗下有个矮小的骑士，盔甲被月光染得苍白，肩披厚重的白色披风，正在吊桥上来回踱步。从身高看来，定是普列斯顿·格林菲尔爵士。太后虽然同意她在城堡内自由出入，但若想在深夜离开梅葛楼，一定会遭他盘问。到时候她该怎么说呢？她突然很庆幸自己烧了那封信。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When a fire was blazing in the hearth, Sansa thanked the maid curtly and ordered her out. The girl was quick to obey, as ever, but Sansa decided there was something sly about her eyes. Doubtless, she was scurrying off to report to the queen, or maybe Varys. All her maids spied on her, she was certain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="壁炉里的火生好之后，珊莎草率地向女仆道过谢，便命她退出去。这女孩和过去其他女仆一样很听话，只是珊莎觉得她的眼神不怀好意，想必这会儿便急着去向太后或瓦里斯打小报告吧。她坚信，所有的女侍都是派来监视她的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"As you wish." Sansa watched the girl suspiciously. Had she seen the note? Had she put it under the pillow? It did not seem likely; she seemed a stupid girl, not one you'd want delivering secret notes, but Sansa did not know her. The queen had her servants changed every fortnight, to make certain none of them befriended her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“照您的意。”珊莎满腹猜疑地看着这位女孩。她发现信件了吗？难道是她把信放到枕头底下的？不太可能，这女孩看起来有些蠢笨，秘密送信的事不会交给这种人办。其实珊莎对她了解不多，太后每隔两周便调换她的侍女，以免她们交上朋友。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She was wide awake when she heard the shouting. Distant at first, then growing louder. Many voices yelling together. She could not make out the words. And there were horses as well, and pounding feet, shouts of command. She crept to her window and saw men running on the walls, carrying spears and torches. Go back to your bed, Sansa told herself, this is nothing that concerns you, just some new trouble out in the city. The talk at the wells had all been of troubles in the city of late. People were crowding in, running from the war, and many had no way to live save by robbing and killing each other. Go to bed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="呐喊声传来时，她一点睡意也无。声音起初遥远，继而逐渐变大，那是无数人同时大喊的合声。她听不出在喊些什么。除此之外，还有马嘶、沉重的脚步声和发号施令的呼喝。她爬到窗边，看见城墙上人影晃动，长枪和火炬忽隐忽现。回去睡觉，珊莎对自己说，这不干你的事，定是城里又起了骚动。仆人们都说近来城中时有动乱，躲避战火的难民不断涌进都城，很多人只能靠抢劫和残杀为生。回去睡吧。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She unlaced her gown and crawled into her bed, but she did not sleep. Was he still there? she wondered. How long will he wait? It was so cruel, to send her a note and tell her nothing. The thoughts went round and round in her head. If only she had someone to tell her what to do. She missed Septa Mordane, and even more Jeyne Poole, her truest friend. The septa had lost her head with the rest, for the crime of serving House Stark. Sansa did not know what had happened to Jeyne, who had disappeared from her rooms afterward, never to be mentioned again. She tried not to think of them too often, yet sometimes the memories came unbidden, and then it was hard to hold back the tears. Once in a while, Sansa even missed her sister. By now Arya was safe back in Winterfell, dancing and sewing, playing with Bran and baby Rickon, even riding through the winter town if she liked. Sansa was allowed to go riding too, but only in the bailey, and it got boring going round in a circle all day.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她脱去裙服，钻进被窝，却睡不着。“他”还在神木林吗？她不禁暗忖，“他”又会等多久？只给她一张纸条，却什么也不说，这样好残忍啊。百般思绪在她脑中不断回绕。如果有人能告诉她该怎么做就好了。她好想念茉丹修女，还有她最要好的朋友珍妮·普尔。修女由于为史塔克家服务，因此和其他人一样掉了脑袋。珍妮则在她与太后见面后便从房里消失了，从此再无人提起，珊莎不知她究竟出了什么事。她常常试着忘掉她们，但回忆总会突然涌现，泪水便跟着决堤。有时珊莎甚至会想起妹妹。如今艾莉亚一定已经安然返回了临冬城，成天跳舞缝纫，和布兰小瑞肯他们玩耍了吧！假如她心情不错，说不定还可以骑马到避冬市镇里去呢。珊莎也可以骑马，但只能在内城，多绕几圈就没意思了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A column of red-cloaked swordsmen ran past as she slipped out into the night. She waited until they were well past before she darted across the undefended drawbridge. In the yard, men were buckling on swordbelts and cinching the saddles of their horses. She glimpsed Ser Preston near the stables with three others of the Kingsguard, white cloaks bright as the moon as they helped Joffrey into his armor. Her breath caught in her throat when she saw the king. Thankfully, he did not see her. He was shouting for his sword and crossbow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她刚潜入黑夜，便有一队红袍剑士跑过无人防守的吊桥。她直等他们走远后才跟着快步冲过。院子里，士兵正忙着系剑带、装马鞍。她瞥见普列斯顿爵士站在马厩旁，正和另外三名身着月白披风的御林铁卫一同协助乔佛里穿戴盔甲。看见国王，她喉咙立时一紧，所幸他没发现她，而是一直高叫着要人拿剑和十字弓。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sansa turned away without thinking and ran to her wardrobe. Oh, what am I doing? she asked herself as she dressed. This is madness. She could see the lights of many torches on the curtain walls. Had Stannis and Renly come at last to kill Joffrey and claim their brother's throne? If so, the guards would raise the drawbridge, cutting off Maegor's Holdfast from the outer castle. Sansa threw a plain grey cloak over her shoulders and picked up the knife she used to cut her meat. If it is some trap, better that I die than let them hurt me more, she told herself. She hid the blade under her cloak.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="珊莎不假思索地转身跑向衣柜。哎哟，我这是在做什么？她边穿衣服边扪心自问。这真是疯了。她看到外墙上火炬通明，难道史坦尼斯和蓝礼终于前来杀掉乔佛里，夺回哥哥的王位了吗？如果是这样，守卫一定会升起吊桥，切断梅葛楼与外城间的联系。珊莎披上一件浅灰斗篷，又拿了她平常切肉用的餐刀。如果这是个陷阱，那我宁愿死去，也不愿再受侮辱，她对自己说，接着把刀藏进斗篷。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sansa had favored her mother's gods over her father's. She loved the statues, the pictures in leaded glass, the fragrance of burning incense, the septons with their robes and crystals, the magical play of the rainbows over altars inlaid with mother-ofpearl and onyx and lapis lazuli. Yet she could not deny that the godswood had a certain power too. Especially by night. Help me, she prayed, send me a friend, a true knight to champion me…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="相比父亲信仰的古老诸神，珊莎更喜欢母亲的七神。她喜欢雕像和彩绘玻璃上的图案，燃香的气息，身穿长袍手捧水晶的修士，镶着珠母、玛瑙和天青石的祭坛，以及照洒其上、绚丽灿烂的七彩虹光。但她不能否认神木林的确有种特别的力量，尤其是在夜晚。帮帮我吧，她暗暗祈祷，为我送来友伴，一个愿为我挺身而战的真正骑士…">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The noise receded as she moved deeper into the castle, never daring to look back for fear that Joffrey might be watching… or worse, following. The serpentine steps twisted ahead, striped by bars of flickering light from the narrow windows above. Sansa was panting by the time she reached the top. She ran down a shadowy colonnade and pressed herself against a wall to catch her breath. When something brushed against her leg, she almost jumped out of her skin, but it was only a cat, a ragged black tom with a chewed-off ear. The creature spit at her and leapt away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她越往城堡深处去，嘈杂声便越小。但她始终不敢回头，惟恐乔佛里正盯着自己…甚至尾随在后。盘旋的楼梯就在前方，其上窄窗溢出的光线在地面印落一条条明灭不定的光纹。走到楼梯顶端，珊莎已经气喘吁吁了。她跑过一条阴影幢幢的柱廊，贴在一面墙上稍事休息。有东西从脚边擦过，把她吓得魂飞魄散。幸好那只是少了个耳朵，全身凌乱肮脏的黑公猫，它朝她吐口口水，跳了开去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">By the time she reached the godswood, the noises had faded to a faint rattle of steel and a distant shouting. Sansa pulled her cloak tighter. The air was rich with the smells of earth and leaf. Lady would have liked this place, she thought. There was something wild about a godswood; even here, in the heart of the castle at the heart of the city, you could feel the old gods watching with a thousand unseen eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="抵达神木林时，耳边的音响褪变为微弱的金属碰撞和遥远的喊叫。珊莎拉紧斗篷，空气中充溢着泥土和树叶的味道。淑女一定会喜欢上这里，她心想。神木林有种原始的感觉，即便在这里，在都市中心的坚堡深处，你依旧可以感到古老诸神正用几千只看不见的眼睛凝视着你。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Thank you, sweet lady." Ser Dontos lurched clumsily to his feet, and brushed earth and leaves from his knees. "Your lord father was as true a man as the realm has ever known, but I stood by and let them slay him. I said nothing, did nothing… and yet, when Joffrey would have slain me, you spoke up. Lady, I have never been a hero, no Ryam Redwyne or Barristan the Bold. I've won no tourneys, no renown in war… but I was a knight once, and you have helped me remember what that meant. My life is a poor thing, but it is yours." Ser Dontos placed a hand on the gnarled bole of the heart tree. He was shaking, she saw.

The lioness didn't give a shit that she was Lannister's own sigil. Bitch tore into my lord's horse and would have done for my lord too, but my grandfather came up with the hounds. Three of his dogs died running her off. My grandfather lost a leg, so Lannister paid him for it with lands and a towerhouse, and took his son to squire. The three dogs on our banner are the three that died, in the yellow of autumn grass. A hound will die for you, but never lie to you. And he'll look you straight in the face."
