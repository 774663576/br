<div class="line_en">Down the road from the gate they fled. In fifty paces, with a swift bend round a jutting bastion of the cliff, it took them out of sight from the Tower. They had escaped for the moment. Cowering back against the rock they drew breath, and then they clutched at their hearts. Perching now on the wall beside the ruined gate the Nazgûl sent out its deadly cries. All the cliffs echoed.</div>

<div class="line_en">In terror they stumbled on. Soon the road bent sharply eastward again and exposed them for a dreadful moment to view from the Tower. As they flitted across they glanced back and saw the great black shape upon the battlement; then they plunged down between high rock-walls in a cutting that fell steeply to join the Morgul-road. They came to the way-meeting. There was still no sign of orcs, nor of an answer to the cry of the Nazgûl; but they knew that the silence would not last long. At any moment now the hunt would begin.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在恐惧中，两人蹒跚前行，很快的，道路就又往东急转，让他们暴露在高塔的视线之中。他们回头偷瞄了一眼，发现那巨大的黑色身影依旧栖息在堡垒的墙上。接着，两人就钻进岩壁间的一条小路，沿着陡峭的斜坡和通往魔窟的道路会合。他们来到了十字路口，但附近依旧没有半兽人的踪迹，也没有任何对戒灵嚎叫的回应。但是，他们心里都很清楚，这一片沉寂是不会持久的，追捕随时都会开始。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The eastern faces of the Ephel Dúath were sheer, falling in cliff and precipice to the black trough that lay between them and the inner ridge. A short way beyond the way-meeting, after another steep incline, a flying bridge of stone leapt over the chasm and bore the road across into the tumbled slopes and glens of the Morgai. With a desperate spurt Frodo and Sam dashed along the bridge; but they had hardly reached its further end when they heard the hue and cry begin. Away behind them, now high above on the mountain-side, loomed the Tower of Cirith Ungol, its stones glowing dully. Suddenly its harsh bell clanged again, and then broke into a shattering peal. Horns sounded. And now from beyond the bridge-end came answering cries. Down in the dark trough, cut off from the dying glare of Orodruin, Frodo and Sam could not see ahead, but already they heard the tramp of iron-shod feet, and upon the road there rang the swift clatter of hoofs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="伊菲尔杜亚斯的东面草木不生，绝壁上毫无攀附的地方，山势直直地落到下方的深沟中。在十字路口不远的地方，有一座高耸的石桥；它跨过深沟，通往摩盖乱石遍布的崎岖山丘。山姆和佛罗多别无选择，只能死命地往那座桥冲；但是，他们还没抵达桥头，那嚎叫声又再度开始了。他们身后紧靠着山边的，就是那直入云霄的西力斯昂哥高塔，上面的岩壁反射着恐怖的红光。突然间，惊人的钟声响起，然后，众钟齐鸣、号角响起，从桥的另一端传来了回应。佛罗多和山姆两人正在那深沟中，连火山的光芒都被阻挡，因此完全看不见外界的变化；不过，他们已经开始听见了铁鞋的脚步声，道路的方向则是传来马蹄声──">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He let go. Frodo followed. And even as they fell they heard the rush of horsemen sweeping over the bridge and the rattle of orc-feet running up behind. But Sam would have laughed, if he had dared. Half fearing a breaking plunge down on to unseen rocks the hobbits landed, in a drop of no more than a dozen feet, with a thud and a crunch into the last thing that they had expected: a tangle of thorny bushes. There Sam lay still, softly sucking a scratched hand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他松手了，佛罗多紧跟在后。这时马蹄声和半兽人的脚步都已经逼到他们身后，结果却大出人意料之外，如果山姆敢笑，他可能会大声笑出来。哈比人在担心会落入万丈深渊的恐惧中跳了下去，实际上这却不过只有数十尺，而且，他们着地的位置是连想也没想到的一丛灌木中。山姆躺在那边动也不动，庆幸吸着被割伤的手指。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When the sound of hoof and foot had passed he ventured a whisper. "Bless me, Mr. Frodo, but I didn't know as anything grew in Mordor! But if I had a'known, this is just what I'd have looked for. These thorns must be a foot long by the feel of them; they've stuck through everything I've got on.

<div class="line_cn" title="当头顶上的声音都离开之后，他才冒险压低声音说：“佛罗多先生，天哪，我根本没想到魔多会有植物生长！如果我早知道，真该躲开来才对。我觉得这些树上的刺搞不好有一尺长，我全身的衣服被刺得都是洞，真希望我当初有穿半兽人的盔甲！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Quick, Sam! Over we go!" cried Frodo. They scrambled on to the low parapet of the bridge. Fortunately there was no longer any dreadful drop into the gulf, for the slopes of the Morgai had already risen almost to the level of the road; but it was too dark for them to guess the depth of the fall.</div>

The Mountain smouldered and its fires went out. The glare faded from the cliffs. The easterly wind that had been blowing ever since they left Ithilien now seemed dead. Slowly and painfully they clambered down, groping, stumbling, scrambling among rock and briar and dead wood in the blind shadows, down and down until they could go no further.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sam scrambled to his feet. "Well I never!" he said. "I must have dropped off. It's a long time, Mr. Frodo, since I had a proper sleep, and my eyes just closed down on their own."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山姆挣扎着站起来。“真没想到！”他说：“我一定是不小心睡着了，佛罗多先生，我已经好久没有好好睡觉了，我的眼睛会不听话的自己闭起来。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's no good, Sam," he said. "I can't manage it. This mail-shirt, I mean. Not in my present state. Even my mithril-coat seemed heavy when I was tired. This is far heavier. And what's the use of it? We shan't win through by fighting."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“山姆，这样不行的，”他说：“我没办法了，这件锁子甲好重，我现在真的撑不起来。如果我真的很累，连秘银甲都会变得很重。这比秘银甲重多了，但又有什么用？我们又不可能一路杀进去。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Frodo now led the way, northward as near as he could guess, among the stones and boulders lying thick at the bottom of the great ravine. But presently he stopped again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="佛罗多领着路尽可能的往北走，一路上绕过许多深沟底端的岩石。不过，他又停了下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But we may have some to do," said Sam. "And there's knives and stray arrows. That Gollum isn't dead, for one thing. I don't like to think of you with naught but a bit of leather between you and a stab in the dark."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“千万不要这样想！”佛罗多说。“这只会让状况更糟糕，”然后，他伸了伸懒腰，佛罗多觉得浑身酸痛，头晖脑胀，因此沉默了好一段时间。最后，他终于挣扎着站起身，不过，他惊讶地发现山姆竟然睡着了。“山姆，快醒来！”他说：“快点！我们最好继续走下去！”">查看中文翻译</div>

"You wrap that orc-rag close round you, and put the belt outside it. Then this can go over all. It don't look quite orc-fashion, but it'll keep you warmer; and I daresay it'll keep you from harm better than any other gear. It was made by the Lady."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“佛罗多先生，你可以穿我的斗篷，”山姆说。他卸下背包，拿出精灵斗篷。“佛罗多先生，这个怎么样？”他说：“你可以把半兽人的烂衣服披紧一点，然后再把腰带绑上去，这个斗篷就可以穿在外面了。这看起来不太像是半兽人，但它可以保暖。我敢打赌，这可能比任何的盔甲都能够保护你，这是女皇亲手做的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Look here, Sam dear lad," said Frodo: "I am tired, weary, I haven't a hope left. But I have to go on trying to get to the Mountain, as long as I can move. The Ring is enough. This extra weight is killing me. It must go. But don't think I'm ungrateful. I hate to think of the foul work you must have had among the bodies to find it for me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“山姆老弟，你看看我──”佛罗多说：“我很累了，我觉得一点希望也没有。不过，只要我还走得动，我就会想办法往山的方向走。魔戒就已经够折磨人了，这额外的重量更是让我喘不过气来，我一定得脱掉它。千万不要以为我不知感恩，我知道你为了找到这件盔甲，一定在那些尸体里面翻了很久。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Frodo laid aside his cloak and took off the orc-mail and flung it away. He shivered a little. "What I really need is something warm," he said. "It's gone cold, or else I've caught a chill."</div>

<div class="line_en">"There now, Mr. Frodo, it's you that's talking of water this time!" said Sam. "If only the Lady could see us or hear us, I'd say to her: 'Your Ladyship, all we want is light and water: just clean water and plain daylight, better than any jewels, begging your pardon.' But it's a long way to Lórien." Sam sighed and waved his hand towards the heights of the Ephel Dúath, now only to be guessed as a deeper blackness against the black sky.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“佛罗多先生，别闹了，这下子换你开始说水了！”山姆说：“如果女皇可以看见、听见我们，我会跟她说：‘女皇大人，我们只想要光明和水：只要干净的水和普通的光明，就胜过任何的珠宝了！’唉，这里离罗瑞安好远哪…”山姆叹了一口气，对着高耸的伊菲尔比划着，现在，那座山脉已经化成黑暗中模糊的阴影。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They started off again. They had not gone far when Frodo paused. "There's a Black Rider over us," he said. "I can feel it. We had better keep still for a while."</div>

<div class="line_en">Crouched under a great boulder they sat facing back westward and did not speak for some time. Then Frodo breathed a sigh of relief. "It's passed," he said. They stood up, and then they both stared in wonder. Away to their left, southward, against a sky that was turning grey, the peaks and high ridges of the great range began to appear dark and black, visible shapes. Light was growing behind them. Slowly it crept towards the North. There was battle far above in the high spaces of the air. The billowing clouds of Mordor were being driven back, their edges tattering as a wind out of the living world came up and swept the fumes and smokes towards the dark land of their home. Under the lifting skirts of the dreary canopy dim light leaked into Mordor like pale morning through the grimed window of a prison.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们躲在一颗巨石下，一言不发地看着西边，有很长的一段时间没有交谈。然后，佛罗多松了一口气。“他走过了！”他说。两人站了起来，惊讶地看着眼前的景象。在他们左手边，朝南的方向，原先只是黑影的高山开始有了泛灰的色彩，它们后方正逐渐变亮，远方的高空正展开一场搏斗，魔多的黑云正节节败退，来自外界的强风，把这些乌云逐渐吹回它们黑暗的家园。在那缓缓露出的开口中，微弱的光线透入魔多，像是监狱中的一丝阳光。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As Frodo and Sam stood and gazed, the rim of light spread all along the line of the Ephel Dúath, and then they saw a shape, moving at a great speed out of the West, at first only a black speck against the glimmering strip above the mountain-tops, but growing, until it plunged like a bolt into the dark canopy and passed high above them. As it went it sent out a long shrill cry, the voice of a Nazgûl; but this cry no longer held any terror for them: it was a cry of woe and dismay, ill tidings for the Dark Tower. The Lord of the Ringwraiths had met his doom.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在佛罗多和山姆的眼前，那光芒延着伊菲尔杜斯的山峰开始扩散，然后，他们看见有一个身影从西方飞来。一开始只是天际的一个小点，然后变成像是天空中的一道污迹，最后越过他们的头顶；在它消失之前，它发出刺耳的尖叫声，那是戒灵的声音。不过，这声音不再让他们感到恐惧：那是痛苦、害怕的声音，是邪黑塔担心会收到的坏消息──戒灵之王被消灭了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“不，其实没有很明显，山姆，”佛罗多叹了一口气。“那是在山的另一边，我们是往东走，不是往西走。我很累了，山姆，魔戒变得好重，它开始持续不断地出现在我脑海中，像是着火的轮子一样。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sam's quick spirits sank again at once. He looked at his master anxiously, and he took his hand. "Come, Mr. Frodo!" he said. "I've got one thing I wanted: a bit of light. Enough to help us, and yet I guess it's dangerous too. Try a bit further, and then we'll lie close and have a rest. But take a morsel to eat now, a bit of the Elves' food; it may hearten you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山姆的兴奋之情立刻被浇熄了，他紧张地看着主人，握住他的手说：“佛罗多先生，别丧气！”他说：“我至少如愿以偿了：眼前不就有了光吗？至少可以让我们看得比较清楚，但也变得更危险了些，再多走几步，然后我们就可以试着休息。先吃点东西吧，精灵的干粮应该可以让你振奋起来。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sharing a wafer of lembas, and munching it as best they could with their parched mouths, Frodo and Sam plodded on. The light, though no more than a grey dusk, was now enough for them to see that they were deep in the valley between the mountains. It sloped up gently northward, and at its bottom went the bed of a now dry and withered stream. Beyond its stony course they saw a beaten path that wound its way under the feet of the westward cliffs. Had they known, they could have reached it quicker, for it was a track that left the main Morgul-road at the western bridge-end and went down by a long stair cut in the rock to the valley's bottom. It was used by patrols or by messengers going swiftly to lesser posts and strongholds north-away, between Cirith Ungol and the narrows of Isenmouthe, the iron jaws of Carach Angren.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两人分了一块兰巴斯，边用干裂的嘴唇尽可能的多嚼了几下，接着又继续上路了。虽然这只不过是极度微弱的灰光，但也足以让他们看清楚自己身在山丘之间的峡谷中。峡谷缓缓往北攀升，底部似乎原来有着溪水流过，在那多岩的地形间，他们发现了一条饱经践踏的道路，沿着西边的悬崖往前延伸。如果他们预先知道有条路，可能早就往这个方向走了，因为这是从通往魔窟的大道分支出来的岔路，它沿着一道陡峭的阶梯直接通往谷中。这是巡逻队或是信差习惯用的捷径，让他们可以比较快速抵达底下的哨站或是北边的堡垒──介于西力斯昂哥和隘口之间的卡拉其安格南。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was perilous for the hobbits to use such a path, but they needed speed, and Frodo felt that he could not face the toil of scrambling among the boulders or in the trackless glens of the Morgai. And he judged that northward was, maybe, the way that their hunters would least expect them to take. The road east to the plain, or the pass back westward, those they would first search most thoroughly. Only when he was well north of the Tower did he mean to turn and seek for some way to take him east, east on the last desperate stage of his journey. So now they crossed the stony bed and took to the orc-path, and for some time they marched along it. The cliffs at their left were overhung, and they could not be seen from above; but the path made many bends, and at each bend they gripped their sword-hilts and went forward cautiously.</div>

<div class="line_en">The light grew no stronger, for Orodruin was still belching forth a great fume that, beaten upwards by the opposing airs, mounted higher and higher, until it reached a region above the wind and spread in an immeasurable roof, whose central pillar rose out of the shadows beyond their view. They had trudged for more than an hour when they heard a sound that brought them to a halt. Unbelievable, but unmistakable. Water trickling. Out of a gully on the left, so sharp and narrow that it looked as if the black cliff had been cloven by some huge axe, water came dripping down: the last remains, maybe, of some sweet rain gathered from sunlit seas, but ill-fated to fall at last upon the walls of the Black Land and wander fruitless down into the dust. Here it came out of the rock in a little falling streamlet, and flowed across the path, and turning south ran away swiftly to be lost among the dead stones.</div>

<div class="line_en">The river-bed was now some way below the path. They scrambled down to it, and began to cross it. To their surprise they came upon dark pools fed by threads of water trickling down from some source higher up the valley. Upon its outer marges under the westward mountains Mordor was a dying land, but it was not yet dead. And here things still grew, harsh, twisted, bitter, struggling for life. In the glens of the Morgai on the other side of the valley low scrubby trees lurked and clung, coarse grey grass-tussocks fought with the stones, and withered mosses crawled on them; and everywhere great writhing, tangled brambles sprawled. Some had long stabbing thorns, some hooked barbs that rent like knives. The sullen shrivelled leaves of a past year hung on them, grating and rattling in the sad airs, but their maggot-ridden buds were only just opening. Flies, dun or grey, or black, marked like orcs with a red eye-shaped blotch, buzzed and stung; and above the briar-thickets clouds of hungry midges danced and reeled.</div>

"I must rest now, Sam, and sleep if I can," said Frodo. He looked about, but there seemed nowhere even for an animal to crawl into in this dismal country.

<div class="line_en">Frodo sighed and was asleep almost before the words were spoken. Sam struggled with his own weariness, and he took Frodo's hand; and there he sat silent till deep night fell. Then at last, to keep himself awake, he crawled from the hiding-place and looked out. The land seemed full of creaking and cracking and sly noises, but there was no sound of voice or of foot. Far above the Ephel Dúath in the West the night-sky was still dim and pale. There, peeping among the cloud-wrack above a dark tor high up in the mountains, Sam saw a white star twinkle for a while. The beauty of it smote his heart, as he looked up out of the forsaken land, and hope returned to him. For like a shaft, clear and cold, the thought pierced him that in the end the Shadow was only a small and passing thing: there was light and high beauty for ever beyond its reach. His song in the Tower had been defiance rather than hope; for then he was thinking of himself. Now, for a moment, his own fate, and even his master's, ceased to trouble him. He crawled back into the brambles and laid himself by Frodo's side, and putting away all fear he cast himself into a deep untroubled sleep.</div>

<div class="line_en">They woke together, hand in hand. Sam was almost fresh, ready for another day; but Frodo sighed. His sleep had been uneasy, full of dreams of fire, and waking brought him no comfort. Still his sleep had not been without all healing virtue: he was stronger, more able to bear his burden one stage further. They did not know the time, nor how long they had slept; but after a morsel of food and a sip of water they went on up the ravine, until it ended in a sharp slope of screes and sliding stones. There the last living things gave up their struggle; the tops of the Morgai were grassless, bare, jagged, barren as a slate.</div>

Between them and the smoking mountain, and about it north and south, all seemed ruinous and dead, a desert burned and choked. They wondered how the Lord of this realm maintained and fed his slaves and his armies. Yet armies he had. As far as their eyes could reach, along the skirts of the Morgai and away southward, there were camps, some of tents, some ordered like small towns. One of the largest of these was right below them. Barely a mile out into the plain it clustered like some huge nest of insects, with straight dreary streets of huts and long low drab buildings. About it the ground was busy with folk going to and fro; a wide road ran from it south-east to join the Morgul-way, and along it many lines of small black shapes were hurrying.</div>

Behind it there hung a vast shadow, ominous as a thunder-cloud, the veils of Barad-dûr that was reared far away upon a long spur of the Ashen Mountains thrust down from the North. The Dark Power was deep in thought, and the Eye turned inward, pondering tidings of doubt and danger: a bright sword, and a stern and kingly face it saw, and for a while it gave little thought to other things; and all its great stronghold, gate on gate, and tower on tower, was wrapped in a brooding gloom.</div>

Here in the northward regions were the mines and forges, and the musterings of long-planned war; and here the Dark Power, moving its armies like pieces on the board, was gathering them together. Its first moves, the first feelers of its strength, had been checked upon its western line, southward and northward.

After a mile or more they saw, huddled in a hollow at the cliff's foot, the orc-hold that they had guessed was near at hand: a wall and a cluster of stone huts set about the dark mouth of a cave.

One was clad in ragged brown and was armed with a bow of horn; it was of a small breed, black-skinned, with wide and snuffling nostrils: evidently a tracker of some kind. The other was a big fighting-orc, like those of Shagrat's company, bearing the token of the Eye. He also had a bow at his back and carried a short broad-headed spear.

<div class="line_en">"No, not any clear notion, Sam," Frodo answered. "In Rivendell before I set out I was shown a map of Mordor that was made before the Enemy came back here; but I only remember it vaguely. I remember clearest that there was a place in the north where the western range and the northern range send out spurs that nearly meet. That must be twenty leagues at least from the bridge back by the Tower. It might be a good point at which to cross. But of course, if we get there, we shall be further than we were from the Mountain, sixty miles from it, I should think. I guess that we have gone about twelve leagues north from the bridge now. Even if all goes well, I could hardly reach the Mountain in a week. I am afraid, Sam, that the burden will get very heavy, and I shall go still slower as we get nearer."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“山姆，我不是很清楚，”佛罗多回答：“在我们离开瑞文戴尔之前，我曾经看过一张魔王回归之前的魔多地图，但我脑中只剩下很模糊的印象。我只记得北方有个区域，在那里，北方的山脉和西方的山脉延伸出来的山脚几乎交错在一起，从高塔旁边的桥算过去大概至少六十哩。从那边过去或许不错，不过，那里就距离火山比较远了，我想大概也是六十哩左右。我猜，我们现在大概是在桥北边三十六哩的地方；即使一切很顺利，我们也得花上一星期才能抵达火山。山姆，我担心那负担会越来越重，而我的速度会越来越慢。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Slowly the light grew, until it was clearer than it yet had been. A strong wind from the West was now driving the fumes of Mordor from the upper airs. Before long the hobbits could make out the shape of the land for some miles about them. The trough between the mountains and the Morgai had steadily dwindled as it climbed upwards, and the inner ridge was now no more than a shelf in the steep faces of the Ephel Dúath; but to the east it fell as sheerly as ever down into Gorgoroth. Ahead the water-course came to an end in broken steps of rock; for out from the main range there sprang a high barren spur, thrusting eastward like a wall. To meet it there stretched out from the grey and misty northern range of Ered Lithui a long jutting arm; and between the ends there was a narrow gap: Carach Angren, the Isenmouthe, beyond which lay the deep dale of Udûn. In that dale behind the Morannon were the tunnels and deep armouries that the servants of Mordor had made for the defence of the Black Gate of their land; and there now their Lord was gathering in haste great forces to meet the onslaught of the Captains of the West. Upon the out-thrust spurs forts and towers were built, and watch-fires burned; and all across the gap an earth-wall had been raised, and a deep trench delved that could be crossed only by a single bridge.</div>

All now seemed dry and silent; but refusing to despair Sam stooped and listened, and to his delight he caught the sound of trickling.

<div class="line_en">Sam tasted the water, and it seemed good enough. Then he drank deeply, refilled the bottle, and turned to go back. At that moment he caught a glimpse of a black form or shadow flitting among the rocks away near Frodo's hiding-place. Biting back a cry, he leapt down from the spring and ran, jumping from stone to stone. It was a wary creature, difficult to see, but Sam had little doubt about it: he longed to get his hands on its neck. But it heard him coming and slipped quickly away. Sam thought he saw a last fleeting glimpse of it, peering back over the edge of the eastward precipice, before it ducked and disappeared.</div>

They went first to the little spring, and then climbing warily up they came to the road at the point where it swung east towards the Isenmouthe twenty miles away. It was not a broad road, and it had no wall or parapet along the edge, and as it ran on the sheer drop from its brink became deeper and deeper. The hobbits could hear no movements, and after listening for a while they set off eastward at a steady pace.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="魔多的黑暗又回来了，山坡上的了望塔燃着又红又烈的火焰。他们先去把水装满，然后再回到原先的道路，朝着二十哩之外的艾辛口进发。这并不是条很宽的路，两边也没有任何的遮蔽，随着道路不停往前进，它两旁的悬崖也变得越来越陡峭。哈比人听不见任何的风吹草动，因此决定继续稳定往东前进。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After doing some twelve miles, they halted. A short way back the road had bent a little northward and the stretch that they had passed over was now screened from sight. This proved disastrous. They rested for some minutes and then went on; but they had not taken many steps when suddenly in the stillness of the night they heard the sound that all along they had secretly dreaded: the noise of marching feet. It was still some way behind them, but looking back they could see the twinkle of torches coming round the bend less than a mile away, and they were moving fast: too fast for Frodo to escape by flight along the road ahead.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="再走了大约十二哩之后，他们停了下来。在不远之前，这条路往北弯了一些，因此，他们之前所经过的地方全被山势挡住了，这是不幸的开始。两人休息了一段时间，继续往前走，但他们没走几步，在黑暗的夜色中突然传来了他们一直担心的声音：整齐划一的脚步声。目前它离两人还有一段距离，不过后方已经出现了火把的微光，而且就在不到一哩远的地方，正在快速逼近中，佛罗多根本无法在这种速度下，沿着这条路躲过他们。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I feared it, Sam," said Frodo. "We've trusted to luck, and it has failed us. We're trapped." He looked wildly up at the frowning wall, where the road-builders of old had cut the rock sheer for many fathoms above their heads. He ran to the other side and looked over the brink into a dark pit of gloom. "We're trapped at last!" he said. He sank to the ground beneath the wall of rock and bowed his head.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我一直担心会这样，山姆，”佛罗多说：“我们相信运气，但这次它不灵光了，我们被困住了！”他慌乱地看着附近陡峭的岩壁，这是古代的开路者所雕凿出来的光滑山壁，毫无躲藏的空间。他跑到另外一边，发现眼前是看不见底的黑暗深渊。“我们真的无路可逃了！”他靠着山壁，无力地坐倒下来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And so it seemed that they would. The leading orcs came loping along, panting, holding their heads down. They were a gang of the smaller breeds being driven unwilling to their Dark Lord's wars; all they cared for was to get the march over and escape the whip. Beside them, running up and down the line, went two of the large fierce uruks, cracking lashes and shouting. File after file passed, and the tell-tale torchlight was already some way ahead. Sam held his breath. Now more than half the line had gone by. Then suddenly one of the slave-drivers spied the two figures by the road-side. He flicked a whip at them and yelled: "Hi, you! Get up!" They did not answer, and with a shout he halted the whole company.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="看起来他们本来是有这个希望的。带头的半兽人低着头、气喘吁吁地往前跑。他们是比较矮小的半兽人，是在黑暗魔君的军令之下不情愿的疾行军的家伙，他们只想要赶快走到目的，躲过鞭子的痛击。在他们身边跑来跑去维持秩序的，则是两名高大的强兽人，他们不停地挥舞鞭子，大声斥骂。一列又一列的人走了过去，山姆屏住呼吸，队伍已经过了一半。然后，突然间，一名负责驱赶奴隶的士兵发现了他们俩，他用力一甩鞭子，吆喝道：“嘿！你们两个！站起来！”他们没有回答，他大喝一声，号令整个队伍停下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They did not have to wait long. The orcs were going at a great pace. Those in the foremost files bore torches. On they came, red flames in the dark, swiftly growing. Now Sam too bowed his head, hoping that it would hide his face when the torches reached them; and he set their shields before their knees to hide their feet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们没有等很久，半兽人的速度很快，在最前面的人拿着火把，他们飞快靠近，火光在黑暗中摇曳着。山姆这时也低下头，希望能够在火把靠近的时候遮住自己的脸，同时，他也将盾牌拿到前面，刻意遮住两人的脚。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was hard enough for poor Sam, tired as he was; but for Frodo it was a torment, and soon a nightmare. He set his teeth and tried to stop his mind from thinking, and he struggled on. The stench of the sweating orcs about him was stifling, and he began to gasp with thirst. On, on they went, and he bent all his will to draw his breath and to make his legs keep going; and yet to what evil end he toiled and endured he did not dare to think. There was no hope of falling out unseen. Now and again the orc-driver fell back and jeered at them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对可怜的山姆来说，他已经快要撑不住了，但对佛罗多来说简直就是酷刑，很快就成了噩梦。他咬紧牙关，不让自己的脑袋多想，挣扎着继续前进。汗流浃背的半兽人散发出让人欲呕的气味，他开始觉得口干舌燥，队伍不停前进，他用尽所有的意志力让自己保持呼吸，双腿无意识的挪动。但是，在经历过这种折磨和忍耐之后，他会面对什么样的结局？他完全不敢多想。在士兵严格的监视下，根本毫无偷溜的机会，那名士兵不时地回来嘲弄他们。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Come on, you slugs!" he cried. "This is no time for slouching." He took a step towards them, and even in the gloom he recognized the devices on their shields. "Deserting, eh?" he snarled. "Or thinking of it? All your folk should have been inside Udûn before yesterday evening. You know that. Up you get and fall in, or I'll have your numbers and report you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“起来，你们两个懒虫！”他大喊着：“这不是休息的时候！”他往前走了一步，在黑暗中依旧认出了他盾牌上的标记。“逃兵喔？”他怒吼着：“还是正准备要逃？你们这些家伙在昨天傍晚就该到乌顿了！你们不可能不知道。给我站起来，走进队伍里面！不然我就记下你们的兵籍号码往上报！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They struggled to their feet, and keeping bent, limping like footsore soldiers, they shuffled back towards the rear of the line. "No, not at the rear!" the slave-driver shouted. "Three files up. And stay there, or you'll know it, when I come down the line!" He sent his long whip-lash cracking over their heads; then with another crack and a yell he started the company off again at a brisk trot.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两人挣扎着站起来，刻意弯着腰，一拐一拐地装成腿酸的士兵。两人缓缓地钻到队伍的最后面。“不，不是后面！”士兵大喊着：“往前三排！就保持那个位置，不然等我来的时候你就知道了！”他在两人头上将鞭子甩出一声爆响，大喝一声，队伍又开始前进。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"There now!" he laughed, flicking at their legs. "Where there's a whip there's a will, my slugs. Hold up! I'd give you a nice freshener now, only you'll get as much lash as your skins will carry when you come in late to your camp. Do you good. Don't you know we're at war?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哼哈！”他指着他们的腿说：“只要有鞭子，懒惰就不见。快点！我可以用别的方法提醒你们，但到时你可能浑身都是血，走不回你们的营区了。为你自己好，不要做傻事！难道你不知道我们在打仗吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They had gone some miles, and the road was at last running down a long slope into the plain, when Frodo's strength began to give out and his will wavered. He lurched and stumbled. Desperately Sam tried to help him and hold him up, though he felt that he could himself hardly stay the pace much longer. At any moment now he knew that the end would come: his master would faint or fall, and all would be discovered, and their bitter efforts be in vain. "I'll have that big slave-driving devil anyway," he thought.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们又走了好几哩，道路最后终于开始缓缓下降来到平原上，佛罗多的力气几乎已经完全耗尽，意志也开始动摇；山姆绝望地试着扶住他，但连他自己也都快撑不下去了，他知道两人随时都会面临一死：他的主人会昏倒或是跌跤，一切都会被揭穿，他们努力了半天全都白费了。“至少我可以先宰了那个臭家伙！”他想。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then just as he was putting his hand to the hilt of his sword, there came an unexpected relief. They were out on the plain now and drawing near the entrance to Udûn. Some way in front of it, before the gate at the bridge-end, the road from the west converged with others coming from the south, and from Barad-dûr. Along all the roads troops were moving; for the Captains of the West were advancing and the Dark Lord was speeding his forces north. So it chanced that several companies came together at the road-meeting, in the dark beyond the light of the watch-fires on the wall. At once there was great jostling and cursing as each troop tried to get first to the gate and the ending of their march. Though the drivers yelled and plied their whips, scuffles broke out and some blades were drawn. A troop of heavy-armed uruks from Barad-dûr charged into the Durthang line and threw them into confusion.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="正当他握住了剑柄时，突然有了千载难逢的机会──他们已经踏上了平原，正在缓缓地靠近乌顿的入口，在距离桥前大门不远处，往西的道路和往南通往巴拉多的道路会合。所有的道路上都挤满了正在行军的部队，因为西方的将领们正朝着这里进军，而黑暗魔君已经加快了调兵遣将的速度。几个部队就正好和巧遇在道路的会合处，而且附近也完全不在火光的照耀下，到处都一片黑暗。当下此地立刻陷入一团混乱，每一个部队都急着想要冲进门内，结束这累人的行军。巴拉多来的一群重装强兽人冲散了山姆所在的队伍，让众人陷入混乱之中。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dazed as he was with pain and weariness, Sam woke up, grasped quickly at his chance, and threw himself to the ground, dragging Frodo down with him. Orcs fell over them, snarling and cursing. Slowly on hand and knee the hobbits crawled away out of the turmoil, until at last unnoticed they dropped over the further edge of the road. It had a high kerb by which troop-leaders could guide themselves in black night or fog, and it was banked up some feet above the level of the open land.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽然山姆已经累得无法思考，但他还是立刻抓住这机会拉着佛罗多，一起趴了下来；许多半兽人跟着绊倒，开始大声咒骂。哈比人手脚并用的慢慢爬开，最后好不容易才翻到路边的围篱外。道路两边边有几尺高的围篱，让带头的士兵即使在黑夜或是大雾中，也可以有依循的路标。">查看中文翻译</div>
