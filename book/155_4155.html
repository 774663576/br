<div class="line_en">Aunt Alexandra met us and nearly fainted when Calpurnia told her where we were.

She just rearranged food on her plate, looking at it sadly while Calpurnia served Jem, Dill and me with a vengeance. Calpurnia poured milk, dished out potato salad and ham, muttering, "'shamed of yourselves," in varying degrees of intensity. "Now you all eat slow," was her final command.</div>

<div class="line_en">Reverend Sykes had saved our places.

<div class="line_cn" title="赛克斯牧师给我们保留了座位。我们惊奇地发现，我们已离开了差不多一个小时，还惊奇地发现，审判厅跟我们离开时几乎一模一样，只有几个细小的变化：陪审团的席位上没有一个人，被告不知去向，也不见泰勒法官的踪影，不过，我们坐下时他又出现了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"What say? Oh, he did right well. I ain't complainin' one bit -- he was mighty fair-minded. He sorta said if you believe this, then you'll have to return one verdict, but if you believe this, you'll have to return another one. I thought he was leanin' a little to our side --" Reverend Sykes scratched his head.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“说什么？哦，他很好。我一点意见也没有，他很公正。他大概是说，倘若你们相信这一方，就这样裁决，但是，倘若相信另一方，就作出另一样的裁决。我看他有点偏向我们这一边。”赛克斯牧师搔着脑袋回答。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jem smiled. "He's not supposed to lean, Reverend, but don't fret, we've won it," he said wisely. "Don't see how any jury could convict on what we heard --"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杰姆脸上泛起了微笑。“他不该偏袒任何一方。牧师，不要担心，我们已经赢了。”他聪颖地说，“没看见哪个陪审团只根据我们昕到的证据给人定罪。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Now don't you be so confident, Mr. Jem, I ain't ever seen any jury decide in favor of a colored man over a white man…" But Jem took exception to Reverend Sykes, and we were subjected to a lengthy review of the evidence with Jem's ideas on the law regarding rape: it wasn't rape if she let you, but she had to be eighteen -- in Alabama, that is -- and Mayella was nineteen. Apparently you had to kick and holler, you had to be overpowered and stomped on, preferably knocked stone cold. If you were under eighteen, you didn't have to go through all this.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可别这么自信，杰姆先生，我还从没见过哪个陪审团作出有利于黑人而不利于白人的裁决。”但是杰姆不同意赛克斯牧师的看法，他根据自己的有关强奸的法律知识，把那些证据对我们进行了详细分析。杰姆所知道的是：女方同意，不算强奸，不过她的年龄必须是十八岁——这是亚拉巴马州的规定——梅耶拉已经十九岁了。很明显，女方必须拳打脚踢，声嘶力竭地叫喊，然后被制服、被践踏、最好被打昏。如果女方不到十八岁，这些就没有必要。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I looked down and saw Atticus strolling around with his hands in his pockets: he made a tour of the windows, then walked by the railing over to the jury box. He looked in it, inspected Judge Taylor on his throne, then went back to where he started. I caught his eye and waved to him. He acknowledged my salute with a nod, and resumed his tour.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我朝下望去，看见阿迪克斯双手揣在口袋里，踱来踱去，先挨次走过几个窗户，又沿着栏杆走到陪审团的座席旁，朝那边瞧着，看见泰勒法官坐在席位上，又往回走到他原来的地方。我的日光和他的相遇了，我向他挥手，他点头作答，又开始踱起步子来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But the officers of the court, the ones present -- Atticus, Mr. Gilmer, Judge Taylor sound asleep, and Bert, were the only ones whose behavior seemed normal. I had never seen a packed courtroom so still. Sometimes a baby would cry out fretfully, and a child would scurry out, but the grown people sat as if they were in church. In the balcony, the Negroes sat and stood around us with biblical patience.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，举止正常的只有在场的法庭官员：阿迪克斯，吉尔默先生，酣睡着的泰勒先生，还有伯特。我从没看见一个座无虚席的审判厅这么寂静。有时，一个婴儿会烦躁不安地哭一声，一个小孩会匆匆忙忙跑出去，但大人们只是象在教堂里做礼拜一样，静悄悄昀。楼厅看台上，黑人分布在我们周围，站的站着，坐的坐着，都表现出一种敬神似的耐心。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When it bonged eleven times I was past feeling: tired from fighting sleep, I allowed myself a short nap against Reverend Sykes's comfortable arm and shoulder. I jerked awake and made an honest effort to remain so, by looking down and concentrating on the heads below: there were sixteen bald ones, fourteen men that could pass for redheads, forty heads varying between brown and black, and -- I remembered something Jem had once explained to me when he went through a brief period of psychical research: he said if enough people -- a stadium full, maybe -- were to concentrate on one thing, such as setting a tree afire in the woods, that the tree would ignite of its own accord. I toyed with the idea of asking everyone below to concentrate on setting Tom Robinson free, but thought if they were as tired as I, it wouldn't work.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="等到大钟敲十一下时，我失去了感觉。与睡魔搏斗得疲倦不堪，我靠在赛克斯牧师的肩上臂上，美滋滋地打起盹儿来。一会儿，我身子猛地一抖，醒了过来。我赞了很大劲儿想赶走瞌睡。我朝下望着，集中精力注视下面太厅里的脑袋：有十六个光秃秃的，有十四个可以说长着红头发，长着棕色和黑色之间各色头发的有四十个。这时，我记起了杰姆有一段时间在搞心灵研究时对我说过的话，如果很多人——也许要有能挤满一个体育馆那么多的人——把思想集中在某一目标上，比方说，集中在想点燃森林中的某裸树上，那么，这棵树就会自动地燃烧起来。我好玩地想叫下面的每个人都把思想集中在释放汤姆—鲁宾逊这一点上。不过我又想，要是他们都象我一样疲惫不堪，那也起不了什么作用。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But I must have been reasonably awake, or I would not have received the impression that was creeping into me. It was not unlike one I had last winter, and I shivered, though the night was hot. The feeling grew until the atmosphere in the courtroom was exactly the same as a cold February morning, when the mockingbirds were still, and the carpenters had stopped hammering on Miss Maudie's new house, and every wood door in the neighborhood was shut as tight as the doors of the Radley Place. A deserted, waiting, empty street, and the courtroom was packed with people. A steaming summer night was no different from a winter morning. Mr. Heck Tate, who had entered the courtroom and was talking to Atticus, might have been wearing his high boots and lumber jacket. Atticus had stopped his tranquil journey and had put his foot onto the bottom rung of a chair; as he listened to what Mr. Tate was saying, he ran his hand slowly up and down his thigh. I expected Mr. Tate to say any minute, "Take him, Mr. Finch…"</div>

<div class="line_en">But Mr. Tate said, "This court will come to order," in a voice that rang with authority, and the heads below us jerked up. Mr. Tate left the room and returned with Tom Robinson. He steered Tom to his place beside Atticus, and stood there. Judge Taylor had roused himself to sudden alertness and was sitting up straight, looking at the empty jury box.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，塔特先生带着权威性的口吻说：“现在恢复法庭秩序。”下面的脑袋都蓦然抬起。塔特先生走出去，一会儿，领着汤姆—鲁宾逊进来，把他带到阿迪克斯身旁，让他坐在他原来的座位上，自己在一旁站着。泰勒法官已经醍来，恢复了严肃的神态，直挺挺地坐在那里，瞅着空荡荡的陪审团席位。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="后来发生的事情象是一场梦。在梦中，我看见陪审员回来了，一个个象潜水员似的，动作缓慢。传来泰勒法官微小的声音，象是来自遥远的地方。我看见了只有律师的孩于才可能看见也才可能留神的事情，就象望着阿迪克斯走上大街，把一枝步枪端得肩一样平，扣动了扳机，但是虽然我眼睛自始至终望着，心里却明白那枪里没有子弹。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I shut my eyes. Judge Taylor was polling the jury: "Guilty… guilty… guilty… guilty…" I peeked at Jem: his hands were white from gripping the balcony rail, and his shoulders jerked as if each "guilty" was a separate stab between them.</div>

<div class="line_en">I looked around. They were standing. All around us and in the balcony on the opposite wall, the Negroes were getting to their feet. Reverend Sykes's voice was as distant as Judge Taylor's:</div>

<div class="line_en">Judge Taylor was saying something. His gavel was in his fist, but he wasn't using it. Dimly, I saw Atticus pushing papers from the table into his briefcase. He snapped it shut, went to the court reporter and said something, nodded to Mr. Gilmer, and then went to Tom Robinson and whispered something to him. Atticus put his hand on Tom's shoulder as he whispered. Atticus took his coat off the back of his chair and pulled it over his shoulder. Then he left the courtroom, but not by his usual exit. He must have wanted to go home the short way, because he walked quickly down the middle aisle toward the south exit. I followed the top of his head as he made his way to the door. He did not look up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="泰勒法官嘴里在说着什么，手里握着木槌，但并没有敲打。我嚎朦陇陇地看见阿迪克斯把桌上的公文塞进公文包，“啪”地一声关上，走到书记员跟前说了些什么，朝吉尔默先生点点头，又走到汤姆·鲁宾逊身边，把手搭在他肩上，附在他耳旁说了几句。然后，阿迪克斯从椅背上取下上衣披在肩上，朝他平时不走的一个出口走出审判厅。他一定是想抄近路回家，因此快步沿着中间的过道下来，走向南面出口。我眼睛跟着他，盯着他的头顶，可他的头一下都没抬。">查看中文翻译</div>
