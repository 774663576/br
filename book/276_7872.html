<div class="line_en">Lee Clow, the creative director at Chiat/Day who had done the great "1984" ad for the launch of the Macintosh, was driving in Los Angeles in early July 1997 when his car phone rang. It was Jobs. "Hi, Lee, this is Steve," he said. "Guess what? Amelio just resigned. Can you come up here?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Clow said that he didn't pitch for accounts. "You know our work," he said. But Jobs begged him. It would be hard to reject all the others that were making pitches, including BBDO and Arnold Worldwide, and bring back "an old crony," as Jobs put it. Clow agreed to fly up to Cupertino with something they could show. Recounting the scene years later, Jobs started to cry.</div>

<div class="line_en">This chokes me up, this really chokes me up. It was so clear that Lee loved Apple so much. Here was the best guy in advertising. And he hadn't pitched in ten years. Yet here he was, and he was pitching his heart out, because he loved Apple as much as we did. He and his team had come up with this brilliant idea, "Think Different." And it was ten times better than anything the other agencies showed. It choked me up, and it still makes me cry to think about it, both the fact that Lee cared so much and also how brilliant his "Think Different" idea was. Every once in a while, I find myself in the presence of purity-purity of spirit and love-and I always cry. It always just reaches in and grabs me. That was one of those moments. There was a purity about that I will never forget. I cried in my office as he was showing me the idea, and I still cry when I think about it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="想到这件事就会让我哽咽，真的让我哽咽。显然，李还是那么爱苹果。他不愧是最棒的广告人。当时他已经10年没有比过稿了。可他来了，他把他的心都掏了出来，因为他和我们一样爱苹果。是他和他的团队带来了这个无与伦比的创意——“非同凡想”，比其他人的要好上10倍。我激动得说不出话来，现在一想到这个我还是忍不住流泪：李那么在乎苹果，还有他那个棒极了的“非同凡想”。每当我发现自己身处一种纯粹——一种精神与爱的纯粹之中，我就会忍不住掉眼泪。这感觉就这么撞进了我的心，一下子抓住了我。当时就是这样。那种纯粹我永远都不会忘记。他坐在我的办公室里给我看那些创意，我就忍不住哭了。每次一想到这个我还是忍不住要哭。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Apple was going through a review to select a new agency, and Jobs was not impressed by what he had seen.

<div class="line_en">Clow and his team tried a variety of approaches that praised the "crazy ones" who "think different." They did one video with the Seal song "Crazy" ("We're never gonna survive unless we get a little crazy"), but couldn't get the rights to it. Then they tried versions using a recording of Robert Frost reading "The Road Not Taken" and of Robin Williams's speeches from Dead Poets Society. Eventually they decided they needed to write their own text; their draft began, "Here's to the crazy ones."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克劳和他的团队尝试了很多种方式去赞美那些“非同凡想”的“狂人”。他们用席尔（Seal）的歌曲《疯狂》（“若不疯狂，便会灭亡……”）做了一段视频，但是没能拿到这首歌的版权。之后他们又尝试了各种版本，用过美国诗人罗伯特·弗罗斯特（Robert Frost）朗诵《未选择的路》（Jhe Road Not Taken）的录音，也用过罗宾·威廉姆斯（Robin Williams）在《死亡诗社》（Dead Poet—sSociety）中的演讲录音。最终他们决定，需要撰写原创的广告词，于是他们开始写初稿，开头就是：“致疯狂的人……”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jobs and Clow agreed that Apple was one of the great brands of the world, probably in the top five based on emotional appeal, but they needed to remind folks what was distinctive about it. So they wanted a brand image campaign, not a set of advertisements featuring products. It was designed to celebrate not what the computers could do, but what creative people could do with the computers. "This wasn't about processor speed or memory," Jobs recalled. "It was about creativity." It was directed not only at potential customers, but also at Apple's own employees: "We at Apple had forgotten who we were. One way to remember who you are is to remember who your heroes are. That was the genesis of that campaign."</div>

<div class="line_en">Jobs was as demanding as ever. When Clow's team flew up with a version of the text, he exploded at the young copywriter. "This is shit!" he yelled. "It's advertising agency shit and I hate it." It was the first time the young copywriter had met Jobs, and he stood there mute. He never went back.

<div class="line_en">Jobs, who could identify with each of those sentiments, wrote some of the lines himself, including "They push the human race forward." By the time of the Boston Macworld in early August, they had produced a rough version. They agreed it was not ready, but Jobs used the concepts, and the "think different" phrase, in his keynote speech there. "There's a germ of a brilliant idea there," he said at the time. "Apple is about people who think outside the box, who want to use computers to help them change the world."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="其中几句是乔布斯亲自撰写的，包括“他们推动人类向前迈进”那一句。到8月初Macworld大会在波士顿召开时，他们已经有了一个初步的版本，他向自己的团队进行了展示。他们都认为它还不够完善，但乔布斯在他的主题演讲中用上了这些概念以及“非同凡想”这个短语。“一个绝妙的理念正在萌芽，”他说，“苹果品牌代表的，是那些跳出固有模式进行思考的人，那些想用计算机帮助自己改变世界的人。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They debated the grammatical issue: If "different" was supposed to modify the verb "think," it should be an adverb, as in "think differently." But Jobs insisted that he wanted "different" to be used as a noun, as in "think victory" or "think beauty." Also, it echoed colloquial use, as in "think big." Jobs later explained, "We discussed whether it was correct before we ran it. It's grammatical, if you think about what we're trying to say. It's not think the same, it's think different. Think a little different, think a lot different, think different. 'Think differently' wouldn't hit the meaning for me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们争论了语法问题：如果“非同”（different）是修饰动词“想”（think），那应该以副词的形式出现，即“想得不同”（think differently）。但是乔布斯坚持说他想要把“非同”当成名词来用，就像“think victory”（思考胜利）或“think beauty”（思考美丽）里的用法一样。同时，这也体现了一种口语用法，诸如“think big”（野心勃勃）这类短语。乔布斯后来解释说：“我们在推出它之前讨论了它的正确性。如果你想想我们要表达的意思，就知道它是合乎语法的。不是想‘同样的事’，而是想‘不同的事’。想一点不同的事，想很多不同的事，非同凡想。而‘想得不同’就表达不出我想要的意思。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In addition to the television commercials, they created one of the most memorable print campaigns in history. Each ad featured a black-and-white portrait of an iconic historical figure with just the Apple logo and the words "Think Different" in the corner. Making it particularly engaging was that the faces were not captioned. Some of them-Einstein, Gandhi, Lennon, Dylan, Picasso, Edison, Chaplin, King-were easy to identify. But others caused people to pause, puzzle, and maybe ask a friend to put a name to the face: Martha Graham, Ansel Adams, Richard Feynman, Maria Callas, Frank Lloyd Wright, James Watson, Amelia Earhart.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="除了电视广告，他们还创造了历史上最令人难忘的一系列平面广告。每则广告都有一个标志性历史人物的黑白肖像，除此之外只有角落里的苹果标志和广告语“非同凡想”。更酷的是，这些肖像都没有说明文字。其中有些人——爱因斯坦、甘地、列侬、迪伦、毕加索、爱迪生、卓别林、马丁·路德·金——很容易辨认。但是另一些就不那么容易叫出名字，需要加以猜测或询问别人那是谁：玛莎·葛莱姆（Martha Graham）、安塞尔·亚当斯、理查德·费曼（Richard Feynman）、玛利亚·卡拉斯（Maria Callas）、弗兰克·劳埃德·赖特、詹姆斯·沃森（James Watson）、阿梅莉亚·埃尔哈特（Amelia Earlmrt）。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In order to evoke the spirit of Dead Poets Society, Clow and Jobs wanted to get Robin Williams to read the narration. His agent said that Williams didn't do ads, so Jobs tried to call him directly. He got through to Williams's wife, who would not let him talk to the actor because she knew how persuasive he could be. They also considered Maya Angelou and Tom Hanks. At a fund-raising dinner featuring Bill Clinton that fall, Jobs pulled the president aside and asked him to telephone Hanks to talk him into it, but the president pocket-vetoed the request. They ended up with Richard Dreyfuss, who was a dedicated Apple fan.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="为了让人们联想到《死亡诗社》的精神，克劳和乔布斯想让罗宾·威廉姆斯朗读这段旁白。威廉姆斯的经纪人说他不做广告，于是乔布斯尝试直接给他打电话。他联系上了威廉姆斯的妻子，但她不让他直接和威廉姆斯通话，因为她知道乔布斯多么擅长说服别人。他们还考虑了玛雅·安吉洛（Maya Angelou）和汤姆·汉克斯。那年秋天，在一场比尔·克林顿出席的筹款晚宴上，乔布斯把总统拉到一边，请求他打电话给汉克斯，说服汉克斯来做这件事，但是总统“搁置否决”了这个请求。最终他们选定了理查德·德莱福斯（Richard Dreyfuss），他是位忠实的苹果迷。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Most were Jobs's personal heroes. They tended to be creative people who had taken risks, defied failure, and bet their career on doing things in a different way. A photography buff, he became involved in making sure they had the perfect iconic portraits. "This is not the right picture of Gandhi," he erupted to Clow at one point. Clow explained that the famous Margaret Bourke-White photograph of Gandhi at the spinning wheel was owned by Time-Life Pictures and was not available for commercial use. So Jobs called Norman Pearlstine, the editor in chief of Time Inc., and badgered him into making an exception. He called Eunice Shriver to convince her family to release a picture that he loved, of her brother Bobby Kennedy touring Appalachia, and he talked to Jim Henson's children personally to get the right shot of the late Muppeteer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这些人大多是乔布斯心目中的偶像。他们都富有创造性，敢于冒险，不惧失败，赌上自己的职业生涯去做与众不同的事情。作为一个摄影迷，乔布斯亲自参与照片选择，确保为偶像们选到完美的肖像。“这张甘地的照片不对劲儿。”有一次他对克劳发火。克劳解释说，那张由摄影师玛格丽特·伯克—怀特（Margaret Bourke—White）拍摄的甘地在纺车边的著名照片，肖像版权由时代与生活图片社所有，不能被用于商业用途。于是，乔布斯给时代公司的主编诺曼·珀尔斯坦（Norman Pearlstine）打电话，软磨硬泡地让他破了一次例。他打电话给尤妮斯·施赖弗（EuniceShriver），确认她的家族同意公开一张她哥哥鲍比·肯尼迪（Bobby Kennedy）在阿巴拉契亚山间旅行的照片，他很喜欢那一张；他还亲自跟吉姆·汉森（Jim Henson）的孩子们沟通，拿到了这位已故提线木偶剧演员的最合适的照片。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He likewise called Yoko Ono for a picture of her late husband, John Lennon. She sent him one, but it was not Jobs's favorite. "Before it ran, I was in New York, and I went to this small Japanese restaurant that I love, and let her know I would be there," he recalled. When he arrived, she came over to his table. "This is a better one," she said, handing him an envelope. "I thought I would see you, so I had this with me." It was the classic photo of her and John in bed together, holding flowers, and it was the one that Apple ended up using. "I can see why John fell in love with her," Jobs recalled.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他同样给小野洋子打电话要一张她已故丈夫约翰·列侬的照片。她给他寄了一张，但那不是乔布斯最喜欢的。“在广告投放之前，我在纽约，去了一家我喜欢的日本小餐馆，并告诉她我会在那里。”他回忆说。当他到达时，小野洋子来到他面前。“这张好一些，”她说着，递给他一个信封。“我想我会见到你，所以我就随身带着这个。”这就是那张她和约翰拿着花束一起在床上的经典照片。苹果最终使用了这张照片。“我能看出来约翰为什么会爱上她。”乔布斯回忆说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jobs couldn't decide whether to use the version with his voice or to stick with Dreyfuss. Finally, the night came when they had to ship the ad; it was due to air, appropriately enough, on the television premiere of Toy Story. As was often the case, Jobs did not like to be forced to make a decision. He told Clow to ship both versions; this would give him until the morning to decide. When morning came, Jobs called and told them to use the Dreyfuss version. "If we use my voice, when people find out they will say it's about me," he told Clow. "It's not. It's about Apple."</div>

<div class="line_en">The narration by Richard Dreyfuss worked well, but Lee Clow had another idea. What if Jobs did the voice-over himself? "You really believe this," Clow told him. "You should do it." So Jobs sat in a studio, did a few takes, and soon produced a voice track that everyone liked. The idea was that, if they used it, they would not tell people who was speaking the words, just as they didn't caption the iconic pictures. Eventually people would figure out it was Jobs. "This will be really powerful to have it in your voice," Clow argued. "It will be a way to reclaim the brand."</div>

<div class="line_en">Very few other companies or corporate leaders-perhaps none-could have gotten away with the brilliant audacity of associating their brand with Gandhi, Einstein, Picasso, and the Dalai Lama. Jobs was able to encourage people to define themselves as anticorporate, creative, innovative rebels simply by the computer they used. "Steve created the only lifestyle brand in the tech industry," Larry Ellison said. "There are cars people are proud to have-Porsche, Ferrari, Prius-because what I drive says something about me. People feel the same way about an Apple product."</div>

<div class="line_en">Ever since he left the apple commune, Jobs had defined himself, and by extension Apple, as a child of the counterculture. In ads such as "Think Different" and "1984," he positioned the Apple brand so that it reaffirmed his own rebel streak, even after he became a billionaire, and it allowed other baby boomers and their kids to do the same. "From when I first met him as a young guy, he's had the greatest intuition of the impact he wants his brand to have on people," said Clow.</div>

<div class="line_en">Starting with the "Think Different" campaign, and continuing through the rest of his years at Apple, Jobs held a freewheeling three-hour meeting every Wednesday afternoon with his top agency, marketing, and communications people to kick around messaging strategy. "There's not a CEO on the planet who deals with marketing the way Steve does," said Clow. "Every Wednesday he approves each new commercial, print ad, and billboard." At the end of the meeting, he would often take Clow and his two agency colleagues, Duncan Milner and James Vincent, to Apple's closely guarded design studio to see what products were in the works. "He gets very passionate and emotional when he shows us what's in development," said Vincent. By sharing with his marketing gurus his passion for the products as they were being created, he was able to ensure that almost every ad they produced was infused with his emotion.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从“非同凡想”宣传活动开始，乔布斯会在每周三下午跟他的主要代理商、营销部门和公关部门开三个小时的自由讨论会，探讨广告战略，这个惯例在乔布斯在苹果公司的岁月里一直延续了下去。“地球上再没有哪个CEO像史蒂夫一样对待市场营销，”克劳说，“每周三他都在审定新的电视广告、平面广告和广告牌。”会议结束后，乔布斯常常带克劳和克劳的两个同事——邓肯·米尔纳（Duncan Milner）和詹姆斯·文森特（James Vincent）——一起去苹果戒备森严的设计工作室看开发中的产品。“当他向我们展示正在开发的东西时，会变得激情澎湃。”文森特说。乔布斯在产品创造过程中就和营销专家们分享他的激情，可以确保他们制作的每一个广告中都灌输了他的情感。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As he was finishing work on the "Think Different" ad, Jobs did some different thinking of his own. He decided that he would officially take over running the company, at least on a temporary basis. He had been the de facto leader since Amelio's ouster ten weeks earlier, but only as an advisor. Fred Anderson had the titular role of interim CEO. On September 16, 1997, Jobs announced that he would take over that title, which inevitably got abbreviated as iCEO. His commitment was tentative: He took no salary and signed no contract. But he was not tentative in his actions. He was in charge, and he did not rule by consensus.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当“非同凡想”广告的制作接近尾声时，乔布斯有了些新想法。他决定正式接手公司经营，至少是暂时性的。自从10周前阿梅里奥离职之后，他一直都是头顶“顾问”名号的实际领导者，弗雷德·安德森只是名义上的临时CEO（interim CEO）。1997年9月16日，乔布斯宣布他将接手这个职务，临时CEO这一名称也被缩写成了iCEO。他的承诺显得没什么把握：不领薪水，也不签合同。但是他的行动却没有丝毫踌躇。他掌管一切，唯我独尊。">查看中文翻译</div>

Fisher of Kodak, Sam Palmisano at IBM, Ed Zander at Sun Microsystems-but most of the candidates were understandably reluctant to consider becoming CEO if Jobs was going to remain an active board member. The San Francisco Chronicle reported that Zander declined to be considered because he "didn't want Steve looking over his shoulder, second-guessing him on every decision." At one point Jobs and Ellison pulled a prank on a clueless computer consultant who was campaigning for the job; they sent him an email saying that he had been selected, which caused both amusement and embarrassment when stories appeared in the papers that they were just toying with him.</div>

<div class="line_en">One of his motivating passions was to build a lasting company. At age twelve, when he got a summer job at Hewlett-Packard, he learned that a properly run company could spawn innovation far more than any single creative individual. "I discovered that the best innovation is sometimes the company, the way you organize a company," he recalled. "The whole notion of how you build a company is fascinating.

When Michael Dell was asked at a computer trade show in October 1997 what he would do if he were Steve Jobs and taking over Apple, he replied, "I'd shut it down and give the money back to the shareholders." Jobs fired off an email to Dell. "CEOs are supposed to have class," it said. "I can see that isn't an opinion you hold." Jobs liked to stoke up rivalries as a way to rally his team-he had done so with IBM and Microsoft-and he did so with Dell. When he called together his managers to institute a build-to-order system for manufacturing and distribution, Jobs used as a backdrop a blown-up picture of Michael Dell with a target on his face.

<div class="line_en">Bill Gates, who was building a fortune by licensing Microsoft's operating system, had urged Apple to do the same in 1985, just as Jobs was being eased out. Gates believed that, even if Apple took away some of Microsoft's operating system customers, Microsoft could make money by creating versions of its applications software, such as Word and Excel, for the users of the Macintosh and its clones. "I was trying to do everything to get them to be a strong licensor," he recalled. He sent a formal memo to Sculley making the case. "The industry has reached the point where it is now impossible for Apple to create a standard out of their innovative technology without support from, and the resulting credibility of, other personal computer manufacturers," he argued. "Apple should license Macintosh technology to 3–5 significant manufacturers for the development of 'Mac Compatibles.'" Gates got no reply, so he wrote a second memo suggesting some companies that would be good at cloning the Mac, and he added, "I want to help in any way I can with the licensing. Please give me a call."</div>

<div class="line_en">One of the great debates about Apple was whether it should have licensed its operating system more aggressively to other computer makers, the way Microsoft licensed Windows. Wozniak had favored that approach from the beginning. "We had the most beautiful operating system," he said, "but to get it you had to buy our hardware at twice the price. That was a mistake. What we should have done was calculate an appropriate price to license the operating system." Alan Kay, the star of Xerox PARC who came to Apple as a fellow in 1984, also fought hard for licensing the Mac OS software. "Software people are always multiplatform, because you want to run on everything," he recalled. "And that was a huge battle, probably the largest battle I lost at Apple."</div>

<div class="line_en">Apple resisted licensing out the Macintosh operating system until 1994, when CEO Michael Spindler allowed two small companies, Power Computing and Radius, to make Macintosh clones. When Gil Amelio took over in 1996, he added Motorola to the list. It turned out to be a dubious business strategy: Apple got an $80 licensing fee for each computer sold, but instead of expanding the market, the cloners cannibalized the sales of Apple's own high-end computers, on which it made up to $500 in profit.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="苹果一直拒绝把麦金塔的操作系统授权出去，直到1994年，CEO迈克尔·斯平德勒允许了两家小公司——PowerComputing和Radius——生产麦金塔兼容机。1996年吉尔·阿梅里奥接管公司后，又增加了摩托罗拉。结果表明这是一个值得怀疑的商业战略：每卖出一台兼容机，苹果收取80美元的授权费，但是这些兼容机并没有让苹果扩大市场，反而挤压了苹果自己的高端计算机销售，而卖出一台苹果电脑的利润能达到500美元。然而乔布斯反对兼容机项目还不仅仅是出于经济上的考虑。他打心眼儿里反感这种做法。他的核心原则之一就是硬件和软件应该紧密结合。他喜欢控制产品的所有方面，而唯一的方式就是制造全套设备，全方面负责用户体验。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jobs's objections to the cloning program were not just economic, however. He had an inbred aversion to it.

<div class="line_en">So upon his return to Apple he made killing the Macintosh clones a priority. When a new version of the Mac operating system shipped in July 1997, weeks after he had helped oust Amelio, Jobs did not allow the clone makers to upgrade to it. The head of Power Computing, Stephen "King" Kahng, organized pro-cloning protests when Jobs appeared at Boston Macworld that August and publicly warned that the Macintosh OS would die if Jobs declined to keep licensing it out. "If the platform goes closed, it is over," Kahng said. "Total destruction. Closed is the kiss of death."</div>

One day he was walking the halls and ran into a young Wharton School graduate who had been Amelio's assistant and who said he was wrapping up his work.

<div class="line_en">The product review revealed how unfocused Apple had become. The company was churning out multiple versions of each product because of bureaucratic momentum and to satisfy the whims of retailers. "It was insanity," Schiller recalled. "Tons of products, most of them crap, done by deluded teams." Apple had a dozen versions of the Macintosh, each with a different confusing number, ranging from 1400 to 9600.

One of the first things Jobs did during the product review process was ban PowerPoints. "I hate the way people use slide presentations instead of thinking," Jobs later recalled.

"You shouldn't be wasting your time on such crappy products." Many of the engineers were infuriated at his slash-and-burn tactics, which resulted in massive layoffs. But Jobs later claimed that the good engineers, including some whose projects were killed, were appreciative.

"I don't understand," Jobs said at the product review meeting. "You're going to ship a million and not make money on these? This is nuts." He left the room and called the head of HP. Let's tear up our arrangement, Jobs proposed, and we will get out of the printer business and just let you do it. Then he came back to the boardroom and announced the decision.

For the fiscal year that ended when Jobs became interim CEO in September 1997, Apple lost $1.04 billion. "We were less than ninety days from being insolvent," he recalled. At the January 1998 San Francisco Macworld, Jobs took the stage where Amelio had bombed a year earlier. He sported a full beard and a leather jacket as he touted the new product strategy. And for the first time he ended the presentation with a phrase that he would make his signature coda: "Oh, and one more thing..." This time the "one more thing" was "Think Profit." When he said those words, the crowd erupted in applause. After two years of staggering losses, Apple had enjoyed a profitable quarter, making $45 million. For the full fiscal year of 1998, it would turn in a $309 million profit. Jobs was back, and so was Apple.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这种专注的能力拯救了苹果。在他回归的第一年，乔布斯裁掉了3000多人，扭转了公司的财务状况。到1997年9月乔布斯成为临时CEO时，之前的一个财政年度苹果已经亏损了10。4亿美元。“我们离破产不到90天。”他回忆说。到1998年1月旧金山的Macworld大会上，乔布斯登上了一年前被阿梅里奥毁掉的舞台。他留着络腮胡子，穿着皮夹克，讲述着新的产品战略。在结束演讲时，他第一次使用了后来变成他标志性结束语的那句话：“噢，还有一件事……”这一次，“还有一件事”就是“考虑利润”（Think Profit）。当他说出这句话时，观众席爆发出了热烈的掌声。在经历了两年的巨额亏损后，苹果终于在该季度赢利，获得了4500万美元利润。1998年整个财政年度，苹果实现了3。09亿美元的赢利。乔布斯归来，苹果归来。">查看中文翻译</div>
