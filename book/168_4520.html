<div class="line_en">She stood at Robb's left hand beside the high seat, and for a moment felt almost as if she were looking down at her own dead, at Bran and Rickon. These boys had been much older, but death had shrunken them. Naked and wet, they seemed such little things, so still it was hard to remember them living.</div>

<div class="line_en">They carried the corpses in upon their shoulders and laid them beneath the dais. A silence fell across the torchlit hall, and in the quiet Catelyn could hear Grey Wind howling half a castle away. He smells the blood, she thought, through stone walls and wooden doors, through night and rain, he still knows the scent of death and ruin.</div>

<div class="line_en">The blond boy had been trying to grow a beard. Pale yellow peach fuzz covered his cheeks and jaw above the red ruin the knife had made of his throat. His long golden hair was still wet, as if he had been pulled from a bath. By the look of him, he had died peacefully, perhaps in sleep, but his brown-haired cousin had fought for life. His arms bore slashes where he'd tried to block the blades, and red still trickled slowly from the stab wounds that covered his chest and belly and back like so many tongueless mouths, though the rain had washed him almost clean.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那金发小孩的下巴上，才刚长出几点浅黄色的胡须，胡须下面就是匕首割开的红色伤痕。他长长的金发依旧湿辘，就象刚洗过澡，死得如此沉静，如此平和，想必还在睡梦之中。他的棕发表弟却为生命搏斗过，手臂全是格挡留下的剑伤，而红色的液体依旧从胸膛、小腹和背部的伤口中缓缓流出，好象全身上下许多无牙的嘴巴在淌唾沫，幸好夜雨将其他部分冲刷干净。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Her brother Edmure stood to Robb's right, one hand upon the back of his father's seat, his face still puffy from sleep. They had woken him as they had her, pounding on his door in the black of night to yank him rudely from his dreams. Were they good dreams, brother? Do you dream of sunlight and laughter and a maiden's kisses? I pray you do. Her own dreams were dark and laced with terrors.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="弟弟艾德慕站在罗柏右边，一只手放在他父亲宝座的椅背上，神情还有些迷迷糊糊。国王派人将他们姐弟从熟睡中唤醒，粗暴地打断了弟弟的美梦。弟弟，你真的在做美梦吗？你真的梦见了阳光、欢笑和少女之吻吗？希望如此。她自己的梦总是黑暗而恐怖。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Robb had donned his crown before coming to the hall, and the bronze shone darkly in the torchlight. Shadows hid his eyes as he looked upon the dead. Does he see Bran and Rickon as well? She might have wept, but there were no tears left in her. The dead boys were pale from long imprisonment, and both had been fair; against their smooth white skin, the blood was shockingly red, unbearable to look upon. Will they lay Sansa down naked beneath the Iron Throne after they have killed her? Will her skin seem as white, her blood as red? From outside came the steady wash of rain and the restless howling of a wolf.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="罗柏是戴着王冠来的，青铜在火炬下散发出昏暗的光，撒下阴影，遮蔽了他死盯住尸体的眼睛。他也看到了布兰和瑞肯的影子吗？她想哭，却没有眼泪。两个孩子死前遭到长期囚禁，皮肤显得苍白，但掩盖不了本身的俊俏，令人震颤的血红配上白皙柔软的皮肤，让人不忍目睹。倘若珊莎被害，他们也会把她放在铁王座下么？她的白肤也会染满鲜血吗？门外，雨，哗哗地下，狼，无情地嗥。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Robb's captains and lords bannermen stood about the hall, some mailed and armed, others in various states of dishevelment and undress. Ser Raynald and his uncle Ser Rolph were among them, but Robb had seen fit to spare his queen this ugliness. The Crag is not far from Casterly Rock, Catelyn recalled. leyne may well have played with these boys when all of them were children.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="高台底站满罗柏麾下的诸侯和将领，有的披挂好盔甲和兵器，有的只来得及穿便服乃至睡衣。雷纳德·维斯特林爵士和他叔叔罗佛·斯派瑟爵士也在其中，但罗柏并未打搅他的王后。峭岩城离凯岩城不远，凯特琳忆起，简妮小时候说不定常和今天横死的这两位孩子玩耍呢。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It seemed a very long time before Robb lifted his eyes from the bloody dead. "Smalljon," he said, "tell your father to bring them in." Wordless, Smalljon Umber turned to obey, his steps echoing in the great stone hall.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="良久，国王才把目光自血淋淋的尸体上抬起。“小琼恩，”他说，“叫你父亲把他们带进来。”听罢此话，小琼恩·安柏无言地转身，脚步回荡在雄伟的石厅内。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As the Greatjon marched his prisoners through the doors, Catelyn made note of how some other men stepped back to give them room, as if treason could somehow be passed by a touch, a glance, a cough. The captors and the captives looked much alike; big men, every one, with thick beards and long hair. Two of the Greatjon's men were wounded, and three of their prisoners. only the fact that some had spears and others empty scabbards served to set them apart. All were clad in mail hauberks or shirts of sewn rings, with heavy boots and thick cloaks, some of wool and some of fur. The north is hard and cold, and has no mercy, Ned had told her when she first came to Winterfell a thousand years ago.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着大琼恩押解犯人进厅，凯特琳发现人们纷纷避之惟恐不及，好似罪恶能通过触碰、眼神乃至咳嗽传染似的。押送者和俘虏长得同样高大，粗粗的胡子，发长过肩。大琼恩的部下有两人带伤，俘虏中也有三人中剑。他们都穿着铁环串联成的链甲或环甲杉，长筒靴，厚斗篷，其中有羊毛织的，也有天然动物毛皮。只能看手中是否握有兵器来将他们区分开来。北境是个酷寒艰苦的地方，毫无怜悯可言，一千年以前，当她首度来到临冬城时，奈德便提醒过她。">查看中文翻译</div>

When I first came to Winterfell, I was hurt whenever Ned went to the godswood to sit beneath his heart tree. Part of his soul was in that tree, I knew, a part I would never share. Yet without that part, I soon realized, he would not have been Ned. Jeyne, child, you have wed the north, as I did… and in the north, the winters will come." She tried to smile. "Be patient. Be understanding. He loves you and he needs you, and he will come back to you soon enough. This very night, perhaps. Be there when he does. That is all I can tell you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“有时候，”凯特琳缓缓地说，“最好的办法就是什么也不做。当年我初次来到临冬城，很不习惯我的丈夫奈德常到神木林里、坐在心树之下。我明白，他灵魂的一部分在那棵树里面，而那一部分我永不可能分享；我也明白，除开那一部分，他就不再是奈德了。简妮，我的孩子，你嫁给了北方，和我一样…而在北方，你得忍受凛冬的考验，”她试着微笑，“你要忍耐，要学会理解。他爱你，需要你，很快就会回到你身边。或许就在今晚。请你耐心等待，这就是我能告诉你的一切。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tell me what I should do. Catelyn might have asked the same, if her father had been well enough to ask. But Lord Hoster was gone, or near enough. Her Ned as well. Bran and Rickon too, and Mother, and Brandon so long ago. Only Robb remained to her, Robb and the fading hope of her daughters.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="谁来教教我啊？凯特琳也想提同样的问题。如果父亲在就好了。可惜霍斯特公爵已奄奄一息，命不久矣。奈德也死了。布兰和瑞肯，母亲，还有很久以前的布兰登，统统都已故去。如今我只剩下罗柏，还有女儿们渺茫的归还希望。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The young queen listened raptly. "I will," she said when Catelyn was done. "I'll be there." She got to her feet. "I should go back. He might have missed me. I'll see. But if he's still at his maps, I'll be patient."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="年轻的王后全神贯注地倾听。“我会的，”凯特琳说完后她表示，“我会一直等他。”她站起来，“我得回去了。陛下可能正在思念我。我要照顾他。就算他继续看地图，我也会耐心等待。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Do," said Catelyn, but when the girl was at the door, she thought of something else. "Jeyne," she called after, "there's one more thing Robb needs from you, though he may not know it yet himself. A king must have an heir."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“去吧，孩子，”凯特琳说，当女孩走到门边时，她忽然想起另一件事。“简妮，”她喊道，“罗柏有一件事非常需要你的帮助，虽然他自己可能还不明白。国王必须要有继承人。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The girl smiled at that. "My mother says the same. She makes a posset for me, herbs and milk and ale, to help make me fertile. I drink it every morning. I told Robb I'm sure to give him twins. An Eddard and a Brandon. He liked that, I think. We… we try most every day, my lady. Sometimes twice or more." The girl blushed very prettily. "I'll be with child soon, I promise. I pray to our Mother Above, every night."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="女孩害羞地微笑，“我母亲也这么说，为了让我怀孕，她用草药、牛奶和麦酒调饮料，叫我每天早上都喝。我告诉罗柏，一定会为他产下一对双胞胎。一个叫艾德，一个叫布兰登。他听了很喜欢。我们…我们每天都试，夫人。有时候一天试两三次呢。”女孩羞红的脸分外漂亮，“我很快就会有孩子的，我向您保证。每天晚上，我都向圣母祈祷。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Very good. I will add my prayers as well. To the old gods and the new."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“很好，很好。从今往后，我也会加入你的祈祷，向新神旧神同时求告。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When the girl had gone, Catelyn turned back to her father and smoothed the thin white hair across his brow. "An Eddard and a Brandon," she sighed softly. "And perhaps in time a Hoster. Would you like that?" He did not answer, but she had never expected that he would. As the sound of the rain on the roof mingled with her father's breathing, she thought about Jeyne. The girl did seem to have a good heart, just as Robb had said. And good hips, which might be more important.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="女孩走后，凯特琳回到父亲身边，替他理了理稀疏的白发。“一个叫艾德，一个叫布兰登，”她轻叹道，“第三个就叫霍斯特，您喜欢吗？”父亲没有回答，她知道他无法回答，四下惟有细雨声，伴随着同样细弱的呼吸。她又想起了简妮。看来罗柏眼光不错，这女孩的确有一副好心肠。更重要的是，她的生产能力也很强…">查看中文翻译</div>
