<div class="line_en">They had left the Hogwarts grounds completely; they had obviously traveled miles -- perhaps hundreds of miles -- for even the mountains surrounding the castle were gone. They were standing instead in a dark and overgrown graveyard; the black outline of a small church was visible beyond a large yew tree to their right. A hill rose above them to their left. Harry could just make out the outline of a fine old house on the hillside.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“好。”哈利很高兴塞德里克先说了出来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Squinting tensely through the darkness, they watched the figure drawing nearer, walking steadily toward them between the graves. Harry couldn't make out a face, but from the way it was walking and holding its arms, he could tell that it was carrying something. Whoever it was, he was short, and wearing a hooded cloak pulled up over his head to obscure his face. And -- several paces nearer, the gap between them closing all the time -- Harry saw that the thing in the persons arms looked like a baby… or was it merely a bundle of robes?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们紧张地眯起眼睛望着黑暗中，一个人影在坟墓之间一步步朝他们走来。哈利看不清那人的脸，但从步态和手臂的姿势看，那人好像抱着什么东西。他身材矮小，穿一件带兜帽的斗篷，遮着面孔。再走近几步——他们之间的距离在不断缩小，哈利看出那人抱的东西像是一个婴儿——或者只是一包衣服？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And then, without warning, Harry's scar exploded with pain. It was agony such as he had never felt in all his life; his wand slipped from his fingers as he put his hands over his face; his knees buckled; he was on the ground and he could see nothing at all; his head was about to split open.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然，哈利的伤疤剧烈疼痛起来。他有生以来从未感受过如此剧烈的疼痛。魔杖滑落在地上，他双手捂住面孔，腿一弯倒在地上，眼前什么也看不见了，脑袋像要炸裂一般。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A blast of green light blazed through Harry's eyelids, and he heard something heavy fall to the ground beside him; the pain in his scar reached such a pitch that he retched, and then it diminished; terrified of what he was about to see, he opened his stinging eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一片强烈的绿光刺透哈利的眼皮，他听见什么东西在他身旁沉重地倒下。伤疤疼到了极点，他恶心得想吐。然后疼痛减轻了，他恐惧地慢慢睁开刺痛的双眼。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For a second that contained an eternity, Harry stared into Cedric's face, at his open gray eyes, blank and expressionless as the windows of a deserted house, at his half-open mouth, which looked slightly surprised. And then, before Harry's mind had accepted what he was seeing, before he could feel anything but numb disbelief, he felt himself being pulled to his feet.</div>

<div class="line_en">The short man in the cloak had put down his bundle, lit his wand, and was dragging Harry toward the marble headstone. Harry saw the name upon it flickering in the wandlight before he was forced around and slammed against it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="穿斗篷的矮个儿男人已经放下包袱，点亮了魔杖，正在把哈利朝大理石墓碑拖去。在被一把推过来、后背撞到墓碑上之前，哈利在魔杖闪烁的光芒中看到了一个名字。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“是你！”他惊叫道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But Wormtail, who had finished conjuring the ropes, did not reply; he was busy checking the tightness of the cords, his fingers trembling uncontrollably, fumbling over the knots. Once sure that Harry was bound so tightly to the headstone that he couldn't move an inch, Wormtail drew a length of some black material from the inside of his cloak and stuffed it roughly into Harry's mouth; then, without a word, he turned from Harry and hurried away. Harry couldn't make a sound, nor could he see where Wormtail had gone; he couldn't turn his head to see beyond the headstone; he could see only what was right in front of him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但虫尾巴没有回答。他已经捆完了绳子，正忙着检查捆得紧不紧。他的手指控制不住地颤抖着，摸索着一个个绳结。当确定哈利已被捆得结结实实、一动都不能动了之后，虫尾巴从斗篷里摸出一段黑色的东西，粗鲁地塞进哈利嘴里。然后，他一句话也没说，就匆匆走开了。哈利发不出声音，也看不见虫尾巴去了哪里。他不能扭头看墓碑后面，只能看见正前方的情景。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The cloaked man was now conjuring tight cords around Harry, tying him from neck to ankles to the headstone. Harry could hear shallow, fast breathing from the depths of the hood; he struggled, and the man hit him -- hit him with a hand that had a finger missing. And Harry realized who was under the hood. It was Wormtail.</div>

<div class="line_en">Cedric's body was lying some twenty feet away. Some way beyond him, glinting in the starlight, lay the Triwizard Cup. Harry's wand was on the ground at Cedric's feet. The bundle of robes that Harry had thought was a baby was close by, at the foot of the grave. It seemed to be stirring fretfully. Harry watched it, and his scar seared with pain again… and he suddenly knew that he didn't want to see what was in those robes… he didn't want that bundle opened…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="塞德里克的尸体躺在二十英尺开外的地方。再过去一点儿，三强杯在星光下闪闪发亮。哈利的魔杖丢在塞德里克的脚边。哈利猜想是婴儿的那个包袱就在附近，放在坟墓下面。它似乎躁动不安。哈利注视着它，他的伤疤又火辣辣地疼痛起来…他突然意识到自己不希望看到包袱里的东西…他不希望那个包袱打开。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He could hear noises at his feet. He looked down and saw a gigantic snake slithering through the grass, circling the headstone where he was tied. Wormtail's fast, wheezy breathing was growing louder again. It sounded as though he was forcing something heavy across the ground. Then he came back within Harry's range of vision, and Harry saw him pushing a stone cauldron to the foot of the grave. It was full of what seemed to be water -- Harry could hear it slopping around -- and it was larger than any cauldron Harry had ever used; a great stone belly large enough for a full-grown man to sit in.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他听见脚边有声音，往下一看，只见一条大蛇在草上蜿蜒游动，围着他那块墓碑打转。虫尾巴呼哧呼哧的喘息声又响了起来，他好像在据推着什么沉重的东西。然后他进入了哈利的视线，把一口石头坩埚推到坟墓下面。坩埚里好像盛满了水——哈利听见泼溅的声音。这口坩埚比哈利用过的所有坩埚都大，可容一个成人坐在里面。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The thing inside the bundle of robes on the ground was stirring more persistently, as though it was trying to free itself. Now Wormtail was busying himself at the bottom of the cauldron with a wand. Suddenly there were crackling names beneath it. The large snake slithered away into the darkness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="地上包袱里的东西动得更起劲了，仿佛要挣脱出来。虫尾巴忙着用魔杖在坩埚底部点点划划。突然坩埚下蹿起了噼啪作响的火苗。大蛇向黑暗中游去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The liquid in the cauldron seemed to heat very fast. The surface began not only to bubble, but to send out fiery sparks, as though it were on fire. Steam was thickening, blurring the outline of Wormtail tending the fire. The movements beneath the robes became more agitated. And Harry heard the high, cold voice again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="坩埚里的液体似乎热得很快。表面不仅开始沸腾，而且迸射出火花，像烧着了一样。蒸气越来越浓，照看火苗的虫尾巴的身影都变得模糊起来了。包袱动得更急了。哈利又听到了那个尖厉、冷酷的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was as though Wormtail had flipped over a stone and revealed something ugly, slimy, and blind -- but worse, a hundred times worse. The thing Wormtail had been carrying had the shape of a crouched human child, except that Harry had never seen anything less like a child. It was hairless and scaly-looking, a dark, raw, reddish black. Its arms and legs were thin and feeble, and its face -- no child alive ever had a face like that -- flat and snakelike, with gleaming red eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就好像虫尾巴猛地翻开一块石头，露出一个黏糊糊的、没有眼睛的丑陋东西——不，比这还要可怕，可怕一百倍。虫尾巴抱来的东西外形似是一个蜷缩的婴儿，但哈利从没见过比它更不像婴儿的东西了。它没有毛发，身上仿佛长着鳞片，皮色暗暗的、红红的，像受了伤的嫩肉。它的胳膊和腿又细又软，它的脸——没有哪个活的孩子长着这样一张脸——是一张扁平的蛇脸，上面有一双闪闪发光的红眼睛。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The surface of the grave at Harry's feet cracked. Horrified, Harry watched as a fine trickle of dust rose into the air at Wormtail's command and fell softly into the cauldron. The diamond surface of the water broke and hissed; it sent sparks in all directions and turned a vivid, poisonous-looking blue.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利脚下的坟墓裂开了，哈利惊恐地看见一小缕灰尘应虫尾巴的召唤升到了空中，轻轻落进坩埚里。钻石般的液面破裂了，嘶嘶作响，火花四溅，液体变成了鲜红的蓝色，一看便知有毒。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Wormtail was speaking. His voice shook; he seemed frightened beyond his wits. He raised his wand, closed his eyes, and spoke to the night. "Bone of the father, unknowingly given, you will renew your son!"</div>

<div class="line_en">The thing seemed almost helpless; it raised its thin arms, put them around Wormtail's neck, and Wormtail lifted it. As he did so, his hood fell back, and Harry saw the look of revulsion on Wormtail's weak, pale face in the firelight as he carried the creature to the rim of the cauldron. For one moment, Harry saw the evil, flat face illuminated in the sparks dancing on the surface of the potion. And then Wormtail lowered the creature into the cauldron; there was a hiss, and it vanished below the surface; Harry heard its frail body hit the bottom with a soft thud.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那东西看上去完全没有自理能力，它举起细细的胳膊，搂住虫尾巴的脖子。虫尾巴把它抱在手中。这时虫尾巴的兜蛋掉了下来，哈利看到火光中他那苍白虚弱的脸上带着厌恶的表情。虫尾巴把那东西抱到坩埚边沿，一瞬间哈利看见药水表面跳动的水花照亮了那张邪恶的扁脸。虫尾巴将那东西放进坩埚，随着一阵嘶嘶声，它沉了下去。哈利听见了它软绵绵的身体碰到坩埚底的轻响。">查看中文翻译</div>
