<div class="line_en">On seeing me, Flavius and Octavia shrink back against the tiled walls like they're anticipating an attack, even though I have never hurt them. Unkind thoughts were my worst offense against them, and those I kept to myself, so why do they recoil?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在看见我之后，弗莱维和奥克塔维亚靠在瓷砖墙壁上缩成一团，好像怕我打他们，我从未伤害过他们。对他们的最大伤害也不过就是瞧不起他们。而即使这些我也不曾对他们说过，他们为什么还要缩成一团？">查看中文翻译</div>

Octavia's light evergreen skin, which now hangs too loosely, as if her body were a slowly deflating balloon.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I honestly don't know." There's something in his voice that makes me believe him, and the pallor on Fulvia's face confirms it. Plutarch turns to the guard, who's just appeared in the doorway with Gale right behind him. "I was only told they were being confined. Why are they being punished?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这个，我确实不知情。”从他说话的语气判断，他没有撒谎，富尔维亚脸色苍白，也证明了这一点。这时警卫出现在门口，盖尔跟在他身后，普鲁塔什转向警卫，“我只接到报告说他们的行动受到限制，可为什么要惩罚他们？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Cinna requested this?" I snarl at him. Because if there's one thing I know, it's that Cinna would never have approved the abuse of these three, who he managed with gentleness and patience. "Why are they being treated like criminals?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Octavia begins to sob, muffling the sound in her ragged tunic. I think of how, the first time I survived the arena, Octavia sneaked me a roll under the table because she couldn't bear my hunger. I crawl across to her shaking form. "Octavia?"

The preps have been forced into cramped body positions for so long that even once the shackles are removed, they have trouble walking. Gale, Plutarch, and I have to help them.

It takes her a minute to place the three, given their current condition, but already she wears a look of consternation.

<div class="line_en">My mother was welcomed into the hospital, but she's viewed as more of a nurse than a doctor, despite her lifetime of healing.

<div class="line_en">Either because the prep team's incapacitated or I'm too on edge, Plutarch releases me from Mockingjay duties for the rest of the day. Gale and I head down to lunch, where we're served bean and onion stew, a thick slice of bread, and a cup of water. After Venia's story, the bread sticks in my throat, so I slide the rest of it onto Gale's tray. Neither of us speaks much during lunch, but when our bowls are clean, Gale pulls up his sleeve, revealing his schedule. "I've got training next."</div>

<div class="line_en">We go outside into the large, fenced-in training area beside the woods. Guards open the well-oiled gates without comment. We would be hard-pressed to get past this fence on our own -- thirty feet high and always buzzing with electricity, topped with razor-sharp curls of steel. We move through the woods until the view of the fence has been obscured. In a small clearing, we pause and drop back our heads to bask in the sunlight. I turn in a circle, my arms extended at my sides, revolving slowly so as not to set the world spinning.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们来到林子旁边被隔离网圈起来的大训练场。警卫也没多问就打开了润滑良好的大门。如果我们不遵守时间，就要完全靠自己越过这道隔离网。这是一道三十英尺高的铁丝网，全时通电，发出低沉的嗡嗡声。我们在林子里穿行直到隔离网在我们的视线里变得模糊起来。在一小片空地，我们停了下来，仰起头享受着阳光的照耀。我伸出臂膀，转动身体，但速度不快，免得眩晕。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">My eagerness to escape into the woods, if only for two hours, overrides my current concerns. An immersion into greenery and sunlight will surely help me sort out my thoughts. Once off the main corridors, Gale and I race like schoolchildren for the armory, and by the time we arrive, I'm breathless and dizzy. A reminder that I'm not fully recovered. The guards provide our old weapons, as well as knives and a burlap sack that's meant for a game bag. I tolerate having the tracker clamped to my ankle, try to look as if I'm listening when they explain how to use the handheld communicator. The only thing that sticks in my head is that it has a clock, and we must be back inside 13 by the designated hour or our hunting privileges will be revoked. This is one rule I think I will make an effort to abide.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我急切地想要躲到林子里去，哪怕只有两个小时，这种渴望超越了一切。林子里有绿色的树林和明媚的阳光，这肯定有助于我理清头绪。盖尔和我一走出楼道，就像学校军训的孩子般跑了起来。等我跑到林子时，已经头晕目眩、上气不接下气。这时我才意识到，我还没有完全恢复。警卫把原来的武器和刀子给了我们，还有一个粗布麻袋当猎物袋。脚踝上绑着追踪器，我得忍受，他们给我讲解手持对讲机的使用方法时，我也假装听着。可我真正牢记在心的却是时间表。我必须按规定时间回到十三区，否则我打猎的权限将被废止，这是我必须要严格遵守的规矩。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Are you actually defending them?" He slips the skin from the rabbit in one quick move.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你是在为他们辩护吗？”说着，他一使劲把兔子皮扒了下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That stings, because, in fact, I am, and it's ridiculous. I struggle to find a logical position. "I guess I'm defending anyone who's treated like that for taking a slice of bread. Maybe it reminds me too much of what happened to you over a turkey!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这话刺伤了我，可我也的确是在为他们辩护，太可笑了。我试图找到一个合乎逻辑的理由。“我是在为因拿了一片儿面包而受罚的人辩护，这一下子让我想起你为了火鸡而挨打的事！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Still, he's right. It does seem strange, my level of concern over the prep team. I should hate them and want to see them strung up. But they're so clueless, and they belonged to Cinna, and he was on my side, right?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="也是，他说得没错。我对这些化妆师那么关心，确实令人感到奇怪。我本应恨他们，很高兴看到他们受到惩罚。可他们很笨、他们属于西纳，而西纳站在我一边，不是吗？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm not looking for a fight," Gale says. "But I don't think Coin was sending you some big message by punishing them for breaking the rules here. She probably thought you'd see it as a favor." He stuffs the rabbit in the sack and rises. "We better get going if we want to make it back on time."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我并不想跟你争。可我觉得他们因为坏了规矩而受罚，这并不是说科恩要警告你什么，弄不好她还觉得这是在帮你的忙呢。”他把兔子塞进袋子里，站了起来，“要想不误点儿，我看现在咱们就该走了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I ignore his offer of a hand up and get to my feet unsteadily. "Fine." Neither of us talks on the way back, but once we're inside the gate, I think of something else. "During the Quarter Quell, Octavia and Flavius had to quit because they couldn't stop crying over me going back in. And Venia could barely say good-bye."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他伸出手想拉我起来，可我没理他，而是自己吃力地站起来，“好吧。”一路上我们都没再说什么。等我们进到大门里时，我却突然想起一件事，“在世纪极限赛时，奥克塔维亚和弗莱维给我妆都没化完，因为我要重返赛场，他们一直哭个不停，维尼娅跟我道别时也难过极了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We hand the meat over to Greasy Sae in the kitchen. She likes District 13 well enough, even though she thinks the cooks are somewhat lacking in imagination. But a woman who came up with a palatable wild dog and rhubarb stew is bound to feel as if her hands are tied here.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们把猎物交给在厨房干活的格雷西·塞。虽然她觉得十三区的厨子们缺乏想象力，她还是挺喜欢这里。不管怎么说，对于一个会烹调美味的野狗肉、喜欢做大黄叶炖菜的人来说，在这干活多少有点施展不开。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Exhausted from hunting and my lack of sleep, I go back to my compartment to find it stripped bare, only to remember we've been moved because of Buttercup. I make my way up to the top floor and find Compartment E. It looks exactly like Compartment 307, except for the window -- two feet wide, eight inches high -- centered at the top of the outside wall. There's a heavy metal plate that fastens over it, but right now it's propped open, and a certain cat is nowhere to be seen. I stretch out on my bed, and a shaft of afternoon sunlight plays on my face. The next thing I know, my sister is waking me for 18:00 -- Reflection.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="打猎累了一天，又没睡够觉，我直接回到住处，却发现这里已经搬空了。这时才想起来，为了毛莨花，我们已经搬家了。我来到顶层的E房间，发现这里和307房间一模一样，但这里有一扇两英尺宽、八英寸高的窗户位于墙壁的中央，窗户上装着沉重的铁栅栏，此时却是开着的，而那只猫现在已不知去向。我平躺在床上，一缕午后的斜阳照在我脸上。等妹妹把我叫醒时，已是18：00——反思时间。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Prim tells me they've been announcing the assembly since lunch. The entire population, except those needed for essential jobs, is required to attend. We follow directions to the Collective, a huge room that easily holds the thousands who show up. You can tell it was built for a larger gathering, and perhaps it held one before the pox epidemic. Prim quietly points out the widespread fallout from that disaster -- the pox scars on people's bodies, the slightly disfigured children. "They've suffered a lot here," she says.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="波丽姆告诉我从中午起就广播说要召开会议。除了上班的人，全体公民都要求参加。我们按指示来到可以轻松容纳数千人的会议大厅。这个大厅很大，看得出当时建造时是为了能容纳更多的人，也许在那次瘟疫大暴发时就曾经召开过大型会议。波丽姆悄悄地把受到核辐射的人指给我看——一些人的身上有疤痕，还有一些孩子身体略微畸形。“这里的人肯定遭了不少罪。”她说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I see my mother lead in a group of mobile patients, still wearing their hospital nightgowns and robes. Finnick stands among them, looking dazed but gorgeous. In his hands he holds a piece of thin rope, less than a foot in length, too short for even him to fashion into a usable noose. His fingers move rapidly, automatically tying and unraveling various knots as he gazes about. Probably part of his therapy. I cross to him and say, "Hey, Finnick." He doesn't seem to notice, so I nudge him to get his attention. "Finnick! How are you doing?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时我看到妈妈带着一群身穿病号服的人走了进来，这些人病情不重，还能走动。芬尼克也夹在他们中间。他看上去精神恍惚，但身体倒挺健壮，手里拿着一截不到一英尺长的细细的短绳，这种短绳即使像他那样的巧手也打不出什么有用的结。他四处张望，手里却快速不停地打着结，之后又把它们拆开。这也许是他治疗的方法之一。我走过去说：“嘿，芬尼克。”他好像没注意，我用胳膊肘推了推他，“芬尼克！你怎么样？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Katniss," he says, gripping my hand. Relieved to see a familiar face, I think. "Why are we meeting here?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“凯特尼斯。”他说，一边抓住我的手。我想，他看到一张熟悉的面孔肯定也很高兴，“我们为什么要聚到这儿来？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh. Good. Because I worry about that with Annie. That she'll say something that could be construed as traitorous without knowing it," says Finnick.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“噢，太好了。我还一直担心安妮呢，我真怕她无意中说出什么，被当做叛徒。”芬尼克说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Annie. Uh-oh. Totally forgot her. "Don't worry, I took care of it." I give Finnick's hand a squeeze and head straight for the podium at the front of the room. Coin, who is glancing over her statement, raises her eyebrows at me. "I need you to add Annie Cresta to the immunity list," I tell her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="安妮。唷一噢。完全把她忘了。“别担心，这事交给我。”我用力握了一下芬尼克的手，然后径直朝大厅前方的主席台走太。科恩正在看她的发言稿，她扬起眉毛看着我。“请把安妮兜莱斯加到豁免人员的名单中去。”我对她说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"She's Finnick Odair's --" What? I don't really know what to call her. "She's Finnick's friend. From District Four. Another victor. She was arrested and taken to the Capitol when the arena blew up."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="总统娥眉微皱，“她是什么人？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I think of the scene I walked in on this morning. Of Octavia huddled against the wall. Of how Coin and I must have vastly different definitions of frailty. But I only say, "No? Then it shouldn't be a problem to add Annie."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时，我回想起今早发生的一幕，想起奥克塔维亚蜷缩在墙根的可怜兮兮的样子，在科恩心里，所谓的孱弱肯定与我的想法大相径庭。可我只是说：“不会吗？那把她加上也应该不成问题。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"All right," says the president, penciling in Annie's name. "Do you want to be up here with me for the announcement?" I shake my head. "I didn't think so. Better hurry and lose yourself in the crowd. I'm about to begin." I make my way back to Finnick.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好吧。”总统说着，把安妮的名字也加了进去。“宣布时你是否要跟我站到台上来？”我摇摇头。她接着说：“我也这么想。那你赶紧到人群中去吧，我马上要开始了。”我又回到芬尼克身边。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, the mad girl. That's not really necessary," she says. "We don't make a habit of punishing anyone that frail."</div>

<div class="line_en">Words are another thing not wasted in 13. Coin calls the audience to attention and tells them I have consented to be the Mockingjay, provided the other victors -- Peeta, Johanna, Enobaria, and Annie -- will be granted full pardon for any damage they do to the rebel cause. In the rumbling of the crowd, I hear the dissent. I suppose no one doubted I would want to be the Mockingjay. So naming a price -- one that spares possible enemies -- angers them. I stand indifferent to the hostile looks thrown my way.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在十三区，说话也要言简意赅。科恩请大家注意，她宣布道，凯特尼斯已经同意成为嘲笑鸟，条件是其他的胜利者——皮塔、约翰娜、伊诺贝丽和安妮无论做出任何有害于反抗凯匹特事业的事情，都将获得豁免。人群中一片嘈杂，我听到人们中有人表示不同意。我想没人怀疑我愿意成为嘲笑鸟，所以在这种情况下还提出条件，豁免潜在的敌人，这令他们气愤。许多人对我投来敌视的目光，我却并不以为意。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The president allows a few moments of unrest, and then continues in her brisk fashion. Only now the words coming out of her mouth are news to me. "But in return for this unprecedented request, Soldier Everdeen has promised to devote herself to our cause. It follows that any deviance from her mission, in either motive or deed, will be viewed as a break in this agreement. The immunity would be terminated and the fate of the four victors determined by the law of District Thirteen. As would her own. Thank you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="人群骚动不安时，科恩总统静默了几分钟，之后继续按她一贯简约的风格讲下去，只不过下面讲的话我也是第一次听到。“作为对这一特殊条件的回报，伊夫狄恩战士承诺将献身于我们的事业。今后，如若其在动机或行为上不能履行诺言，将被视为违反这一协定，其他四名胜利者的豁免权也将被终止，他们的命运将由十三区的法律来决定，伊夫狄恩本人也包括在内。谢谢。”">查看中文翻译</div>
