<div class="line_en">The next morning Dorothy kissed the pretty green girl good-bye, and they all shook hands with the soldier with the green whiskers, who had walked with them as far as the gate. When the Guardian of the Gate saw them again he wondered greatly that they could leave the beautiful City to get into new trouble. But he at once unlocked their spectacles, which he put back into the green box, and gave them many good wishes to carry with them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天早晨，多萝茜吻别了绿衣女郎，他们一起和长着绿胡须的兵士握着手，他送他们一块儿同到城门口。当守城门的人又看见了他们，大大地吃惊，他们竟要离开这个美丽的城市，去招来新的困难。他立刻解下了他们的眼镜，放进绿箱子里去，并且向他们鞠躬。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Don't try, my dear," he answered. "We should like to keep you with us, but if it is your wish to return to Kansas, I hope you will find a way. "He then opened the gate of the outer wall, and they walked forth and started upon their journey.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我的亲爱的朋友，别客气，”他回答说，“我们欢迎你和我们在一起，但是倘使你愿意回到堪萨斯州去，我希望你能够找到这条路。”于是他打开外城的大门，让他们走了出去，踏上旅途出发了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I certainly shall if I am able," the Scarecrow replied; "but I must help Dorothy to get home, first."</div>

<div class="line_en">They now turned and took a last look at the Emerald City. All they could see was a mass of towers and steeples behind the green walls, and high up above everything the spires and dome of the Palace of Oz.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如今他们转过身来，向翡翠城看了最后的一眼，望见在绿色城墙的后面，有许多的城堞和礼拜堂上的尖顶，还有奥芝宫殿的螺旋形的圆屋顶，高出在一切东西之上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The sun shone brightly as our friends turned their faces toward the Land of the South. They were all in the best of spirits, and laughed and chatted together. Dorothy was once more filled with the hope of getting home, and the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman were glad to be of use to her. As for the Lion, he sniffed the fresh air with delight and whisked his tail from side to side in pure joy at being in the country again, while Toto ran around them and chased the moths and butterflies, barking merrily all the time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当他们转过身来走向南方的国土去时，太阳很明亮地照耀着。他们精神振作，并且一同大笑着，闲谈着。多萝茜再一次充满着回家的希望，稻草人和铁皮人乐意为她服务。至于狮子，它快活地呼吸着这新鲜的空气，它的尾巴从这一边到那一边地摇动着，它再到这乡村里来，满心地快活。托托在他们的四周奔跑着，并且追捕着飞蛾和蝴蝶，不时快乐地吠着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"City life does not agree with me at all," remarked the Lion, as they walked along at a brisk pace. "I have lost much flesh since I lived there, and now I am anxious for a chance to show the other beasts how courageous I have grown."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“城市的生活，对于我是完全不适合的，”当他们活泼地、轻快地一步一步向前走过去时，狮子批评地说，“自从我住在城里以来，瘦得很多了，现在我渴望有一个机会，向别的野兽们表现出我怎样地有胆量。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oz was not such a bad Wizard, after all," said the Tin Woodman, as he felt his heart rattling around in his breast.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“奥芝毕竟不是怎么坏的一个魔术家。”正当铁皮人觉得他的心在他的胸膛里格格地发响时说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"If Oz had taken a dose of the same courage he gave me," added the Lion, "he would have been a brave man."</div>

<div class="line_en">Dorothy said nothing. Oz had not kept the promise he made her, but he had done his best, so she forgave him. As he said, he was a good man, even if he was a bad Wizard.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="多萝茜不说什么，虽然奥芝没能做到他所允许她的事，但是他尽了他的力量，所以她宽恕了他。正如奥芝自己所说的，即使他是一个没有本领的魔术家，但是他还是一个好人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the morning they traveled on until they came to a thick wood. There was no way of going around it, for it seemed to extend to the right and left as far as they could see; and, besides, they did not dare change the direction of their journey for fear of getting lost. So they looked for the place where it would be easiest to get into the forest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="早晨，他们动身走路，直走到一个密林前面，在那里四周，都没有好走的路，因为那树林仿佛从右到左，一直伸展开去，直到他们目力所能望得到的地方。而且，他们不敢改变他们旅程的方向，因为恐怕迷了路。所以他们找寻一块最容易进入森林去的地方。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The first day's journey was through the green fields and bright flowers that stretched about the Emerald City on every side. They slept that night on the grass, with nothing but the stars over them; and they rested very well indeed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们第一天的旅程，是穿过了从翡翠城那里伸展过来的绿色的田野，鲜丽的花朵，四处都是，那天晚上，他们睡在草地上面。除了繁星盖在他们上面以外，什么都没有，实在的，他们休息得十分舒服。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Scarecrow, who was in the lead, finally discovered a big tree with such wide-spreading branches that there was room for the party to pass underneath. So he walked forward to the tree, but just as he came under the first branches they bent down and twined around him, and the next minute he was raised from the ground and flung headlong among his fellow travelers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="稻草人，他带头走，后来发现一棵大树，这么广阔地展开着枝叶，使得这个团体都可以在树下而经过。所以他先走向前去，但是正当他走到最前面的树枝的下面，它们都弯了下来，缠卷着他，接着，把他从地面上高高地举起来，并且头向着地面把他抛掷在其它旅行者的同伴中间。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Let me try it first," said the Scarecrow, "for it doesn't hurt me to get thrown about. "He walked up to another tree, as he spoke, but its branches immediately seized him and tossed him back again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“让我先去试试，”稻草人说，“因为我抛掷不伤的。”他走向另外一株树去，正当他说着，树枝们立刻捉住了他，再把他掷回来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="狮子叫着说：“在这儿树中间还有另外一个地方可以走。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This did not hurt the Scarecrow, but it surprised him, and he looked rather dizzy when Dorothy picked him up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这样做并不能损伤稻草人什么，但是使他吃惊不小。当多萝茜拉他起来时，他仿佛有几分昏迷的样子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="多萝茜高叫着：“这倒奇怪了，我们将怎么办！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The trees seem to have made up their minds to fight us, and stop our journey," remarked the Lion.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="狮子说：“这些树木，似乎故意向我们挑战，阻止我们前进。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I believe I will try it myself," said the Woodman, and shouldering his axe, he marched up to the first tree that had handled the Scarecrow so roughly. When a big branch bent down to seize him the Woodman chopped at it so fiercely that he cut it in two.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我相信我应该去试试看。”铁皮人说着，举起了他的斧头，向第一株树走去，它是曾经粗暴地捉过稻草人的。当一枝大树枝弯下来捉他时，铁皮人那么凶猛地砍着它，把它劈成两段。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At once the tree began shaking all its branches as if in pain, and the Tin Woodman passed safely under it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那棵树立刻摇撼着它所有的树枝，好像疼痛的样子，铁皮人安全地在它下面走过去了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The other trees of the forest did nothing to keep them back, so they made up their minds that only the first row of trees could bend down their branches, and that probably these were the policemen of the forest, and given this wonderful power in order to keep strangers out of it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个森林里的其他树木，却不曾把他们捉住了掷回去，所以他们以为那只是第一行的树木，才能够弯下它们的枝来，这或许是森林的警察，才有这样奇怪的本领，目的在于赶出陌生的客人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The four travelers walked with ease through the trees until they came to the farther edge of the wood. Then, to their surprise, they found before them a high wall which seemed to be made of white china. It was smooth, like the surface of a dish, and higher than their heads.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="四个旅行者平安地穿过了树林，一直跑出了那树林的边界。随后，使得他们吃惊的，发现前面有一带高墙，比他们的头顶还高出一些，好像是用白瓷砖砌的，光滑得像瓷盆的平面。">查看中文翻译</div>
