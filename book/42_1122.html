<div class="line_en">Stanley took hold of Zero's forearms and pulled him upright. Then he stooped down and let Zero fall over his right shoulder. He stood up, lifting Zero's worn-out body off the ground.</div>

<div class="line_en">He left the shovel and sack of jars behind as he continued up the mountain. Zero's legs dangled in front of him.</div>

<div class="line_en">Higher and higher he climbed. His strength came from somewhere deep inside himself and also seemed to come from the outside as well. After focusing on Big Thumb for so long, it was as if the rock had absorbed his energy and now acted like a kind of giant magnet pulling him toward it.</div>

<div class="line_en">After a while he became aware of a foul odor. At first he thought it came from Zero, but it seemed to be in the air, hanging heavy all around him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不久他闻到一股恶臭。起先他以为是从零蛋身上发出来的，但它似乎就在空气中，浓浓地从周围散发出来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He also noticed that the ground wasn't as steep anymore. As the ground flattened, a huge stone precipice rose up ahead of him, just barely visible in the moonlight. It seemed to grow bigger with each step he took.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他还发现地面没那么陡了。地势缓和下来，在他的面前慢慢地矗立起一块巨大的石壁，在月光下看得不太真切。每向前迈出一步，石壁就似乎增大一分。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Stanley couldn't see his feet, which made it difficult to walk through the tangled patches of weeds and vines. He concentrated on one step at a time, carefully raising and setting down each foot. He thought only about each step, and not the impossible task that lay before him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯坦利看不到自己的脚，只好艰难地穿行在混杂着藤蔓的草丛中。他全神贯注地走好每一步，小心翼翼地抬脚，落脚。他将注意力全都集中在脚下的每一步，而不去想摆在面前的难以完成的任务。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Around him, the smell became stronger. It was the bitter smell of despair.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="四周的恶臭味愈加浓烈。这是一种绝望的苦涩散发出的臭味。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And he knew he'd never be able to climb it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="而且他知道自己根本爬不上去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As he lay face down in the muddy ditch, he didn't know if he'd ever get up again. He didn't know if he'd even try. Had he come all this way just to… You need water to make mud!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他趴在烂泥沟里，不知道自己还能不能再站起来。他不知道自己是否还要再试一下。难道走了这么远的路只是为了…有水才会有烂泥！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It no longer resembled a thumb.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="它不再像是一根拇指了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He crawled along the gully in the direction that seemed the muddiest. The ground became gloppier. The mud splashed up as he slapped the ground.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他顺着泥沟朝看起来最泥泞的地方爬去，地面越来越软。他一拍地面，泥浆便四散飞溅。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Even if he could somehow climb Big Thumb, he knew he wouldn't find water. How could there be water at the top of a giant rock? The weeds and bugs survived only by an occasional rainstorm, like the one he had seen from camp.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就算他能爬上大拇指，也不会找到水源。巨岩上怎么可能会有水？野草和虫子只是靠偶尔的一场暴雨活下来，就像他在翠湖营目睹到的那场暴雨。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His feet slipped out from under him. Zero's head knocked against the back of his shoulder as he fell and tumbled into a small muddy gully.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的脚向外一滑。当他朝一条小泥沟里栽进去的时候，零蛋的头撞在了他的背上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Still, he continued toward it. If nothing else, he wanted to at least reach the Thumb.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，他还是朝它走去。就算什么也没有，他想自己至少得到达那儿。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Using both hands, he dug a hole in the soggy soil. It was too dark to see, but he thought he could feel a tiny pool of water at the bottom of his hole. He stuck his head in the hole and licked the dirt.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他用双手在烂泥地里刨起了洞。夜色太浓了，他看不清楚，但他觉得洞底有一小池水。他把头伸进去，舔着泥土。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He never made it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他永远都无法到达那儿了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He only ate half. He gave the other half to Zero.</div>

<div class="line_en">"A hot fudge sundae."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“巧克力圣代冰激凌。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He bit into it without peeling it. The hot bitter juice burst into his mouth. He could feel it all the way up to his eyes. And when he swallowed, he felt its warmth move down his throat and into his stomach.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他没剥皮直接咬了一口。洋葱辛辣苦涩的汁液猛地进了他嘴里，那股味道直抵他的眼睛。他吞咽着，感到一股暖流经过喉咙直达胃里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He dug until he had a hole that was about as deep as his arm was long. There was enough water for him to scoop out with his hands and drop on Zero's face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他挖呀挖，直到洞有他的整只手臂那么深才停下。水已经够让他掬一捧滴在零蛋的脸上了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What is it?" Zero whispered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“什么东西？”零蛋低声问道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He dug deeper, and as he did so, more water seemed to fill the hole. He couldn't see it, but he could feel it -- first with his fingers, then with his tongue.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他继续往深里挖了一会儿，洞里的水似乎更多了。虽然看不到，但是能感觉到——起初是用手指，后来干脆用舌头舔。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As he continued to widen his hole, his hand came across a smooth, round object. It was too smooth and too round to be a rock.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="洞越挖越大，忽然他的手碰到了一个光溜圆滑的东西。那东西太圆太滑了，绝不可能是石头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Here, eat this."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“给，吃了这个。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Zero's eyes remained closed. But his tongue poked out between his lips, searching out the droplets.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="零蛋的眼睛还是闭着，但舌头伸出来寻找水了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Stanley dragged Zero closer to the hole. He dug, then scooped some more water and let it pour out of his hands into Zero's mouth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯坦利把零蛋拖近洞口。他继续挖，然后又掬了一捧水往零蛋的嘴里倒。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He wiped the dirt off of it and realized it was an onion.</div>
