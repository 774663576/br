<div class="line_en">I have mentioned some few of the more prominent and august calamities on record; but, in these, it is the extent, not less than the character of the calamity, which so vividly impresses the fancy. I need not remind the reader that, from the long and weird catalogue of human miseries, I might have selected many individual instances more replete with essential suffering than any of these vast generalities of disaster. The true wretchedness, indeed -- the ultimate wo -- is particular, not diffuse. That the ghastly extremes of agony are endured by man the unit, and never by man the mass -- for this let us thank a merciful God!</div>

<div class="line_en">There are certain themes of which the interest is all-absorbing, but which are too entirely horrible for the purposes of legitimate fiction. These the mere romanticist must eschew, if he do not wish to offend, or to disgust. They are with propriety handled, only when the severity and majesty of truth sanctify and sustain them. We thrill, for example, with the most intense of "pleasurable pain," over the accounts of the Passage of the Beresina, of the Earthquake at Lisbon, of the Plague at London, of the Massacre of St. Bartholomew, or of the stifling of the hundred and twenty-three prisoners in the Black Hole at Calcutta. But, in these accounts, it is the fact -- it is the reality -- it is the history which excites. As inventions, we should regard them with simple abhorrence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="活埋有些话题非常引人入胜，可要正经八百写成小说，就太恐怖了。如果不希望触犯众怒或是招人厌恶，纯粹的浪漫主义作家应该对这类题目加以规避，惟有以严肃而权威的事实真相作为支撑，方可进行适当的处理。我们读到某些文字时，常常会瑟瑟发抖，感到“愉悦的痛苦”，譬如强渡别列茨那河、里斯本大地震、伦敦黑死病、圣巴塞勒缪大屠杀、加尔各答黑牢里一百二十三名囚犯窒息而死，都能给人这样的阅读感受。不过，这样的叙述之所以激动人心，就在于它揭露了真相、裸出了真实、连通了历史。如果恐怖的表述纯属虚构，则会让我们心生厌憎。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">To be buried while alive is, beyond question, the most terrific of these extremes which has ever fallen to the lot of mere mortality. That it has frequently, very frequently, so fallen will scarcely be denied by those who think. The boundaries which divide Life from Death, are at best shadowy and vague. Who shall say where the one ends, and where the other begins? We know that there are diseases in which occur total cessations of all the apparent functions of vitality, and yet in which these cessations are merely suspensions, properly so called. They are only temporary pauses in the incomprehensible mechanism. A certain period elapses, and some unseen mysterious principle again sets in motion the magic pinions and the wizard wheels. The silver cord was not for ever loosed, nor the golden bowl irreparably broken. But where, mean time, was the soul?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="毫无疑问，在降临到芸芸众生身上的终极灾难中，被人活埋可谓最恐怖的一种。能思考的人几乎都不会否认，活埋人的事一直频频发生。隔开生与死的边界线，是含混而模糊的。谁能说出生命在哪里终结、死亡又在哪里开始？我们知道，有的疾病可以使患者的外观生命机能终止，但恰当地讲，这一终止不过是暂停罢了，是我们尚未了解的生命机制的暂时停歇。一段时间过后，某种看不见的神秘法则，会再次开动那些神奇的小齿轮，开动那些具有魔力的大飞轮，银链并不是永久性松弛，金碗也并非破得无可修复。可在此期间，灵魂寄于何处？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Apart, however, from the inevitable conclusion, a priori, that such causes must produce such effects -- that the well known occurrence of such cases of suspended animation must naturally give rise, now and then, to premature interments -- apart from this consideration, we have the direct testimony of medical and ordinary experience, to prove that a vast number of such interments have actually taken place. I might refer at once, if necessary, to a hundred well authenticated instances. One of very remarkable character, and of which the circumstances may be fresh in the memory of some of my readers, occurred, not very long ago, in the neighboring city of Baltimore, where it occasioned a painful, intense, and widely extended excitement. The wife of one of the most respectable citizens -- a lawyer of eminence and a member of Congress -- was seized with a sudden and unaccountable illness, which completely baffled the skill of her physicians. After much suffering, she died, or was supposed to die. No one suspected, indeed, or had reason to suspect, that she was not actually dead. She presented all the ordinary appearances of death. The face assumed the usual pinched and sunken outline. The lips were of the usual marble pallor. The eyes were lustreless. There was no warmth. Pulsation had ceased. For three days the body was preserved unburied, during which it had acquired a stony rigidity. The funeral, in short, was hastened, on account of the rapid advance of what was supposed to be decomposition.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而撇开这不可避免的推论，撇开这由因及果的推想，生命的暂停是会导致人所共知的活埋事件的发生的，医学上和日常生活中的活生生的事例，都可以证明大量的活埋事例确实存在。如果有必要，我可以马上举出上百个真实的例子。一个性质不同寻常的事例前不久刚刚发生，就在附近的巴尔的摩市，它引发了一场痛苦、激烈、大范围的骚动。某些读者可能对此仍然记忆犹新。一位很受人尊敬的市民的妻子——一位杰出律师、国会议员的夫人，突然患上了莫可名状的病症。这病让她的医生完全不知如何应对。经历很多折磨后，她死了，或者说人们认为她死了。的确，没有一个人怀疑，或者说，没有一个人有理由怀疑她实际上不是真的死了。从表面上看，她呈现出全部特征就是平常的死亡：她的脸部轮廓是收缩的、凹陷的；她的嘴唇是大理石般的苍白；她的眼睛光泽尽失。她没有一丝体温了，连脉搏也停止了跳动。尸体停放了三天，变得石头一样僵硬。总之，考虑到尸体会很快腐烂，葬礼举行得很是仓促。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A careful investigation rendered it evident that she had revived within two days after her entombment -- that her struggles within the coffin had caused it to fall from a ledge, or shelf, to the floor, where it was so broken as to permit her escape. A lamp which had been accidentally left, full of oil, within the tomb, was found empty; it might have been exhausted, however, by evaporation. On the uppermost of the steps which led down into the dread chamber, was a large fragment of the coffin, with which, it seemed, that she had endeavored to arrest attention, by striking the iron door. While thus occupied, she probably swooned, or possibly died, through sheer terror; and, in falling, her shroud became entangled in some iron-work which projected interiorly. Thus she remained, and thus she rotted, erect.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the year 1810, a case of living inhumation happened in France, attended with circumstances which go far to warrant the assertion that truth is, indeed, stranger than fiction. The heroine of the story was a Mademoiselle Victorine Lafourcade, a young girl of illustrious family, of wealth, and of great personal beauty. Among her numerous suitors was Julien Bossuet, a poor litterateur, or journalist, of Paris. His talents and general amiability had recommended him to the notice of the heiress, by whom he seems to have been truly beloved; but her pride of birth decided her, finally, to reject him, and to wed a Monsieur Renelle, a banker, and a diplomatist of some eminence. After marriage, however, this gentleman neglected, and, perhaps, even more positively ill-treated her. Having passed with him some wretched years, she died, -- at least her condition so closely resembled death as to deceive every one who saw her. She was buried -- not in a vault -- but in an ordinary grave in the village of her nativity. Filled with despair, and still inflamed by the memory of a profound attachment, the lover journeys from the capital to the remote province in which the village lies, with the romantic purpose of disinterring the corpse, and possessing himself of its luxuriant tresses. He reaches the grave. At midnight he unearths the coffin, opens it, and is in the act of detaching the hair, when he is arrested by the unclosing of the beloved eyes. In fact, the lady had been buried alive. Vitality had not altogether departed; and she was aroused, by the caresses of her lover, from the lethargy which had been mistaken for death. He bore her frantically to his lodgings in the village. He employed certain powerful restoratives suggested by no little medical learning. In fine, she revived. She recognized her preserver. She remained with him until, by slow degrees, she fully recovered her original health. Her woman's heart was not adamant, and this last lesson of love sufficed to soften it. She bestowed it upon Bossuet. She returned no more to her husband, but concealing from him her resurrection, fled with her lover to America. Twenty years afterwards, the two returned to France, in the persuasion that time had so greatly altered the lady's appearance, that her friends would be unable to recognise her. They were mistaken, however; for, at the first meeting, Monsieur Renelle did actually recognise and make claim to his wife. This claim she resisted; and a judicial tribunal sustained her in her resistance; deciding that the peculiar circumstances, with the long lapse of years, had extinguished, not only equitably, but legally, the authority of the husband.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="1810年，法国发生过一起活埋事件，人们无不理所当然地认为，事实真的比小说还要离奇。故事的主人公是位年轻小姐，名叫维克托希娜。拉福加德，她出身名门，极为富有，而且容颜美丽。在众多的追求者中，有个巴黎的穷文人或者说穷记者——朱利安。博叙埃。他的才华与友善吸引了那位女继承人，他似乎已赢得她的芳心；但最终，她天性中的傲慢却促使她决定拒绝他。她嫁给了赫奈莱先生，一位出众的银行家和外交家。婚后，这位绅士却不在意她，或许甚至不惜虐待她。跟着他不幸地生活几年后，她死了——至少她的状态酷似死亡，看到她的每一个人都被表象蒙蔽了。她入葬了——但不是埋在墓窖里，而是葬于她出生的村子，埋身一个普通的坟墓。那位记者悲痛欲绝。他的记忆中，深切的爱情之火一直在燃烧。痴情的人从首都巴黎出发，跋山涉水到了那个偏僻的外省村子。他心怀浪漫的想法，要把心上人的尸体从坟墓中掘出，剪一束美丽的秀发珍藏。他达到了墓地，于午夜时分把棺木挖出。他打开了棺材盖。正当他动手去拆她的头发时，他发现，心上的人儿睁开了眼睛。事实上，那位女士被活埋了。生命并没完全离她而去。情人的抚摸把她从昏迷中唤醒了。她的昏迷却被人们误会成死亡。他发疯般把她抱回自己在村里的住处，凭着丰富的医学知识，给她吃了些滋补剂。最后，她复活了。她认出了救了自己一命的人。她继续和他呆在一起，慢慢地，她彻底恢复了原有的健康。她那颗女人的心肠并非铁石铸造，这事给她上了爱情的最后一课，足以软化她的心。她没有再回到丈夫身边，也没有让他知道自己复活的事情。她把心儿许给了博叙埃，和情人一道远走美国。二十年后，因为确信时光已大大改变了她的容颜，不会再有朋友认出她来，两个人于是重返法国。然而他们错了，一碰面，赫奈莱先生就认出了妻子，并要求她回到身边。她拒绝了，法庭判决对此予以支持。说他们的情况特殊，那么多年过去了，于理于法，做丈夫的特权都已结束。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The weather was warm; and he was buried, with indecent haste, in one of the public cemeteries. His funeral took place on Thursday. On the Sunday following, the grounds of the cemetery were, as usual, much thronged with visiters; and, about noon, an intense excitement was created by the declaration of a peasant, that, while sitting upon the grave of the officer, he had distinctly felt a commotion of the earth, as if occasioned by some one struggling beneath. At first little attention was paid to the man's asseveration; but his evident terror, and the dogged obstinacy with which he persisted in his story, had at length their natural effect upon the crowd. Spades were hurriedly procured, and the grave, which was shamefully shallow, was, in a few minutes, so far thrown open that the head of its occupant appeared. He was then, seemingly, dead; but he sat nearly erect within his coffin, the lid of which, in his furious struggles, he had partially uplifted.</div>

<div class="line_en">Fearful indeed the suspicion -- but more fearful the doom! It may be asserted, without hesitation, that no event is so terribly well adapted to inspire the supremeness of bodily and of mental distress, as is burial before death. The unendurable oppression of the lungs -- the stifling fumes of the damp earth -- the clinging to the death garments -- the rigid embrace of the narrow house -- the blackness of the absolute Night -- the silence like a sea that overwhelms -- the unseen but palpable presence of the Conqueror Worm -- these things, with thoughts of the air and grass above, with memory of dear friends who would fly to save us if but informed of our fate, and with consciousness that of this fate they can never be informed -- that our hopeless portion is that of the really dead -- these considerations, I say, carry into the heart, which still palpitates, a degree of appalling and intolerable horror from which the most daring imagination must recoil. We know of nothing so agonizing upon Earth -- we can dream of nothing half so hideous in the realms of the nethermost Hell. And thus all narratives upon this topic have an interest profound; an interest, nevertheless, which, through the sacred awe of the topic itself, very properly and very peculiarly depends upon our conviction of the truth of the matter narrated. What I have now to tell, is of my own actual knowledge -- of my own positive and personal experience.</div>

<div class="line_en">For several years I had been subject to attacks of the singular disorder which physicians have agreed to term catalepsy, in default of a more definitive title. Although both the immediate and the predisposing causes, and even the actual diagnosis of this disease, are still mysterious, its obvious and apparent character is sufficiently well understood. Its variations seem to be chiefly of degree. Sometimes the patient lies, for a day only, or even for a shorter period, in a species of exaggerated lethargy. He is senseless and externally motionless; but the pulsation of the heart is still faintly perceptible; some traces of warmth remain; a slight color lingers within the centre of the cheek; and, upon application of a mirror to the lips, we can detect a torpid, unequal, and vacillating action of the lungs. Then again the duration of the trance is for weeks -- even for months; while the closest scrutiny, and the most rigorous medical tests, fail to establish any material distinction between the state of the sufferer and what we conceive of absolute death. Very usually, he is saved from premature interment solely by the knowledge of his friends that he has been previously subject to catalepsy, by the consequent suspicion excited, and, above all, by the non-appearance of decay. The advances of the malady are, luckily, gradual. The first manifestations, although marked, are unequivocal. The fits grow successively more and more distinctive, and endure each for a longer term than the preceding. In this lies the principal security from inhumation. The unfortunate whose first attack should be of the extreme character which is occasionally seen, would almost inevitably be consigned alive to the tomb.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="几年来，疾病一直侵袭我，因为这病没有更为确切的命名，医生们就一致称之为强直性昏厥。尽管这种疾病的直接诱发原因乃至确切症状尚不明朗，但对于它鲜明的表面特征，人们却已经非常了解。其变化似乎主要表现在程度的深浅上。有时患者只会在一天或者更短的一段时间，陷入不同寻常的昏睡状态。这期间，他都毫无知觉，外表上是一动不动，但依稀间，仍然可以感知到他微弱的心跳。他的身上还存留着些许暖意，脸颊上还挂着一抹淡淡的红晕。如果把镜子凑到他的唇边，则能察觉到他迟缓、不规则、犹犹疑疑的肺部活动。然后，这种昏睡状态会持续上几个星期，甚至几个月，即使是再怎么仔细观察，或者再怎么进行严格的医疗测试，也不能确定患者的状态与我们想像中的绝对死亡之间，有什么实质性的差异了。很常见的情况是，他只有依靠朋友对他的了解——知道他以前犯过强直性昏厥，据此产生怀疑，更主要的，依靠身体尚未腐烂，才能免遭活埋的不幸。好在这种疾病是渐进式的，第一次发病虽然症状明显，但不会被含含糊糊地误会成猝死。接下来，会一次比一次发作得厉害，持续时间也一次比一次长久。正因如此，才得以逃脱被活埋的危险。如果有人不幸第一次发作就罕见的厉害，那么，几乎是不可避免地，他就会被活着运进坟墓。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">My own case differed in no important particular from those mentioned in medical books. Sometimes, without any apparent cause, I sank, little by little, into a condition of semi-syncope, or half swoon; and, in this condition, without pain, without ability to stir, or, strictly speaking, to think, but with a dull lethargic consciousness of life and of the presence of those who surrounded my bed, I remained, until the crisis of the disease restored me, suddenly, to perfect sensation. At other times I was quickly and impetuously smitten. I grew sick, and numb, and chilly, and dizzy, and so fell prostrate at once. Then, for weeks, all was void, and black, and silent, and Nothing became the universe. Total annihilation could be no more. From these latter attacks I awoke, however, with a gradation slow in proportion to the suddenness of the seizure. Just as the day dawns to the friendless and houseless beggar who roams the streets throughout the long desolate winter night -- just so tardily -- just so wearily -- just so cheerily came back the light of the Soul to me.</div>

<div class="line_en">In all that I endured there was no physical suffering, but of moral distress an infinitude. My fancy grew charnel. I talked "of worms, of tombs and epitaphs." I was lost in reveries of death, and the idea of premature burial held continual possession of my brain. The ghastly Danger to which I was subjected, haunted me day and night. In the former, the torture of meditation was excessive -- in the latter, supreme. When the grim Darkness overspread the Earth, then, with very (every) horror of thought, I shook -- shook as the quivering plumes upon the hearse. When Nature could endure wakefulness no longer, it was with a struggle that I consented to sleep -- for I shuddered to reflect that, upon awaking, I might find myself the tenant of a grave. And when, finally, I sank into slumber, it was only to rush at once into a world of phantasms, above which, with vast, sable, overshadowing wing, hovered, predominant, the one sepulchral Idea.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我所经历的一切，并没有肉体的痛苦，但精神上的悲凄，却漫无边际。我的想像里，全是停放尸骨的场所。我总是谈论“虫豸、坟墓和墓志铭”。我沉沦于对死亡的幻想中不能自拔。被活埋的念头占据了我的大脑，萦绕不去。我所面临的危险令人毛骨悚然，它日夜不息地纠缠着我。白天，过度思虑的痛苦已经难以承受；晚上，则更加令人发指。当严酷的黑暗笼罩大地，种种可怕的念头于是不期而至，我禁不住浑身发抖——就像灵车上瑟瑟抖动的羽毛。我无法再忍受醒着时的折磨，我也总是挣扎着才肯入睡——因为每当想到醒来时，有可能发现自己已身在坟墓，我就战栗不止。最后，当我终于入睡，那也不过是立刻投身一个幻觉森森的世界。被活埋的念头凌驾于一切之上，它张开遮天蔽日的巨大黑翅，久久地盘旋不去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Apart from the tendency to trance, however, my general health appeared to be good; nor could I perceive that it was at all affected by the one prevalent malady -- unless, indeed, an idiosyncrasy in my ordinary sleep may be looked upon as superinduced. Upon awaking from slumber, I could never gain, at once, thorough possession of my senses, and always remained, for many minutes, in much bewilderment and perplexity; -- the mental faculties in general, but the memory in especial, being in a condition of absolute abeyance.</div>

<div class="line_en">I looked; and the unseen figure, which still grasped me by the wrist, had caused to be thrown open the graves of all mankind; and from each issued the faint phosphoric radiance of decay; so that I could see into the innermost recesses, and there view the shrouded bodies in their sad and solemn slumbers with the worm. But, alas! the real sleepers were fewer, by many millions, than those who slumbered not at all; and there was a feeble struggling; and there was a general sad unrest; and from out the depths of the countless pits there came a melancholy rustling from the garments of the buried. And, of those who seemed tranquilly to repose, I saw that a vast number had changed, in a greater or less degree, the rigid and uneasy position in which they had originally been entombed.

<div class="line_en">Phantasies such as these, presenting themselves at night, extended their terrific influence far into my waking hours. My nerves became thoroughly unstrung, and I fell a prey to perpetual horror. I hesitated to ride, or to walk, or to indulge in any exercise that would carry me from home. In fact, I no longer dared trust myself out of the immediate presence of those who were aware of my proneness to catalepsy, lest, falling into one of my usual fits, I should be buried before my real condition could be ascertained. I doubted the care, the fidelity of my dearest friends. I dreaded that, in some trance of more than customary duration, they might be prevailed upon to regard me as irrecoverable. I even went so far as to fear that, as I occasioned much trouble, they might be glad to consider any very protracted attack as sufficient excuse for getting rid of me altogether. It was in vain they endeavored to reassure me by the most solemn promises. I exacted the most sacred oaths, that under no circumstances they would bury me until decomposition had so materially advanced as to render farther preservation impossible. And, even then, my mortal terrors would listen to no reason -- would accept no consolation. I entered into a series of elaborate precautions. Among other things, I had the family vault so remodelled as to admit of being readily opened from within. The slightest pressure upon a long lever that extended far into the tomb would cause the iron portals to fly back. There were arrangements also for the free admission of air and light, and convenient receptacles for food and water, within immediate reach of the coffin intended for my reception. This coffin was warmly and softly padded, and was provided with a lid, fashioned upon the principle of the vault-door, with the addition of springs so contrived that the feeblest movement of the body would be sufficient to set it at liberty. Besides all this, there was suspended from the roof of the tomb, a large bell, the rope of which, it was designed, should extend through a hole in the coffin, and so be fastened to one of the hands of the corpse. But, alas! what avails the vigilance against the Destiny of man? Not even these well contrived securities sufficed to save from the uttermost agonies of living inhumation, a wretch to these agonies foredoomed!</div>

<div class="line_en">There arrived an epoch -- as often before there had arrived -- in which I found myself emerging from total unconsciousness into the first feeble and indefinite sense of existence. Slowly -- with a tortoise gradation -- approached the faint gray dawn of the psychal day. A torpid uneasiness. An apathetic endurance of dull pain. No care -- no hope -- no effort. Then, after a long interval, a ringing in the ears; then, after a lapse still longer, a pricking or tingling sensation in the extremities; then a seemingly eternal period of pleasurable quiescence, during which the awakening feelings are struggling into thought; then a brief re-sinking into non-entity; then a sudden recovery. At length the slight quivering of an eyelid, and immediately thereupon, an electric shock of a terror, deadly and indefinite, which sends the blood in torrents from the temples to the heart. And now the first positive effort to think. And now the first endeavor to remember. And now a partial and evanescent success. And now the memory has so far regained its dominion, that, in some measure, I am cognizant of my state. I feel that I am not awaking from ordinary sleep. I recollect that I have been subject to catalepsy.

<div class="line_cn" title="我确信了这一点。可是当这个可怕的事实钻进灵魂最深处时，我再次挣扎着大声叫喊。这第二次努力成功了。一阵持久而疯狂的痛苦尖叫，或者说是哀号，划破了在地下的长夜。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“到底出了什么事？”第二个说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What do you mean by yowling in that ere kind of style, like a cattymount?" said a fourth; and hereupon I was seized and shaken without ceremony, for several minutes, by a junto of very rough-looking individuals. They did not arouse me from my slumber -- for I was wide awake when I screamed -- but they restored me to the full possession of my memory.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你刚才像猫一样号叫，到底怎么回事？”第四个说。接着我被一伙看上去很粗野的人抓住了，狠狠地摇晃了几分钟。他们没把我从昏睡中唤醒——因为我在尖叫时已彻底清醒了——但他们却使我彻底恢复了记忆。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This adventure occurred near Richmond, in Virginia. Accompanied by a friend, I had proceeded, upon a gunning expedition, some miles down the banks of the James River. Night approached, and we were overtaken by a storm. The cabin of a small sloop lying at anchor in the stream, and laden with garden mould, afforded us the only available shelter. We made the best of it, and passed the night on board. I slept in one of the only two berths in the vessel -- and the berths of a sloop of sixty or seventy tons need scarcely be described. That which I occupied had no bedding of any kind. Its extreme width was eighteen inches. The distance of its bottom from the deck overhead, was precisely the same. I found it a matter of exceeding difficulty to squeeze myself in. Nevertheless, I slept soundly; and the whole of my vision -- for it was no dream, and no nightmare -- arose naturally from the circumstances of my position -- from my ordinary bias of thought -- and from the difficulty, to which I have alluded, of collecting my senses, and especially of regaining my memory, for a long time after awaking from slumber. The men who shook me were the crew of the sloop, and some laborers engaged to unload it. From the load itself came the earthly smell. The bandage about the jaws was a silk handkerchief in which I had bound up my head, in default of my customary nightcap.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这桩奇遇发生在弗吉尼亚州的里士满附近。我在一位朋友的陪伴下去打猎。我们沿着詹姆斯河走了几英里。夜幕降临时分，我们遭遇了暴风雨。一条装满花泥的单桅小帆船停泊在河边，船舱成了为我们遮风挡雨的惟一藏身处。我们充分利用了它，在船上过了夜。我睡在船上仅有的两个床铺中的一个上面，一艘仅有六七十吨位的单桅帆船，其卧舱当然乏善可陈。我的铺位上没有被褥，宽度至多十八英寸。床铺到头上甲板的距离刚好也是十八英寸。把自己塞进去，可没少费劲。不过我睡得很香。因为无梦，也没做噩梦，所有的幻影自然是产生于我所处的环境，产生于我一向偏执的思想，产生于我前面提及的情况——我一觉醒来，总是长时间难以集中神志，尤其是难以恢复记忆。那些摇晃我的人是单桅帆船上的船员，和几个负责卸货的工人。泥土的气味是船上装的花泥散发出的。绑住下颌的布带是个丝绸手帕，因为没有戴惯了的睡帽，我拿它包了头。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The tortures endured, however, were indubitably quite equal, for the time, to those of actual sepulture. They were fearfully -- they were inconceivably hideous; but out of Evil proceeded Good; for their very excess wrought in my spirit an inevitable revulsion. My soul acquired tone -- acquired temper. I went abroad. I took vigorous exercise. I breathed the free air of Heaven. I thought upon other subjects than Death. I discarded my medical books. "Buchan" I burned. I read no "Night Thoughts" -- no fustian about church-yards -- no bugaboo tales -- such as this. In short I became a new man, and lived a man's life. From that memorable night, I dismissed forever my charnel apprehensions, and with them vanished the cataleptic disorder, of which, perhaps, they had been less the consequence than the cause.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，我所遭受的痛苦与真正的活埋毫无二致。它们非常可怕——可怕得超乎一切想像。不过，祸兮福所倚。极端的痛苦反而使我的心灵不可阻挡地觉醒了。我的灵魂奏响了和谐的音调——它有了一定的韧性。我出国。我充满活力地进行锻炼。我呼吸天堂的自由空气。我思考死亡以外的其他问题。我丢弃了医学书籍。我把“巴肯”烧了。我不再读《夜思》——不再读有关墓地的夸夸其谈——不再读像本篇文章这样的鬼怪故事。总之，我焕然一新，过上了人的日子。在那个值得纪念的夜晚之后，我永远消除了那些阴森恐怖的想像。我的强直性昏厥病症也随之消失了。或许，我之所以发病，正因为心中对阴森恐怖的东西想得太多，而不是因为发病，才心生阴森恐怖的想像。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There are moments when, even to the sober eye of Reason, the world of our sad Humanity may assume the semblance of a Hell -- but the imagination of man is no Carathis, to explore with impunity its every cavern. Alas! the grim legion of sepulchral terrors cannot be regarded as altogether fanciful -- but, like the Demons in whose company Afrasiab made his voyage down the Oxus, they must sleep, or they will devour us -- they must be suffered to slumber, or we perish.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有时，即使在理性的清醒眼光看来，我们人类的悲惨世界，与地狱不无相似之处，但人类的想像力不是卡拉蒂斯，可以不受惩罚地探测每一个洞穴。唉！不能把大量坟墓般的恐怖，都看作是稀奇的想像——但是，像那些追随着阿弗拉斯布在奥克苏斯河的航程的魔鬼，必须入睡，否则它们会把我们吞噬——它们必须陷入昏睡，否则我们就得毁灭。">查看中文翻译</div>
