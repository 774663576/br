<div class="line_en">He crawled after him, and was just able to squeeze his body through the hole. He never would have fit when he first came to Camp Green Lake. He'd lost a lot of weight.</div>

<div class="line_en">"You want some sploosh?" Zero asked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你想来点斯蒲露吗？”零蛋问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You have to. We both have to."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你必须回去。咱俩都必须回去。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's empty," said Stanley. He stared at Zero, not quite believing that he was real. "I tried to bring you the whole water truck, but," he smiled sheepishly, "I drove it into a hole. I can't believe you're…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“空的。”斯坦利说。他盯着零蛋，没法相信零蛋还活着。“我原本打算把整车水都给你带来，但是…”他羞怯地笑了笑，“我把车开到洞里去了。我真不敢相信你…”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="零蛋摇了摇头。“我不回去。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"What?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“什么？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Stanley watched Zero crawl back through his hole. It was a miracle he was still alive, but Stanley knew he would have to get him back to camp soon, even if he had to carry him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯坦利看着零蛋缓缓地爬回洞里。他还活着，这真是个奇迹。可是，斯坦利明白还是得尽快把他带回翠湖营，哪怕背他回去都行。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Zero's face looked like a jack-o'-lantern that had been left out too many days past Halloween -- half rotten, with sunken eyes and a drooping smile. "Is that water?" he asked. His voice was weak and raspy. His lips were so pale they were almost white, and his tongue seemed to flop around uselessly in his mouth as he spoke, as if it kept getting in the way.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="零蛋的脸就像是万圣节过后被丢弃了好久的南瓜灯，一半已经腐烂了，眼睛凹陷，笑容有气无力。“有水吗？”他问道，声音虚弱又刺耳，嘴唇惨白，已经失去血色。说话时，舌头听上去只是在嘴里徒劳地拍打，就好像它唯一的作用是碍事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Me neither," said Zero.</div>

<div class="line_en">As he pulled himself through, his leg struck something sharp and hard. It was a shovel. For a second Stanley wondered how it got there, but then remembered that Zero had taken it with him after striking Mr. Pendanski.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="拽着身体往深处爬的时候，他的腿卡在了一块又尖又硬的东西上。是把铲子。斯坦利一时没想明白铲子怎么会在这里。但很快，他记起当时零蛋用它袭击了潘登斯基先生，随后一直带在身边。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What is it?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这是什么？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Zero held a jar in his hand and grunted as he tried to unscrew the lid.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="零蛋拿起一只罐子，一边拧盖子，一边咕哝。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was cooler under the boat, which was half buried in the dirt. There were enough cracks and holes in the bottom of the boat, now the roof, to provide light and ventilation. He could see empty jars scattered about.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="船的一半埋在土里，底下的确凉快一些。而且，充当屋顶的船体还裂开了很多缝隙和孔洞，使得里面光线充足，通风良好。他看到洞里散落着空罐子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Stanley didn't have a lot of room to move. He reached behind him, grabbed the wooden end of the shovel, and held it out to Zero, blade first.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯坦利没法随意转身，洞里空间不多。他伸手在身后摸索，抓到了铲柄，递给零蛋，铲头朝前。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He still couldn't get the lid off. "I found sixteen jars. Here, hand me the shovel."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="零蛋仍旧没能打开。“我找到了十六瓶。来，把铲子递给我。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Sploosh!" His voice was strained as he worked on the jar. "That's what I call it. They were buried under the boat."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“斯蒲露！”零蛋的声音听起来有些紧，他正在拧盖子，“这是我给起的名字。它们就埋在船底下。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Sometimes you just have to…" Zero said, then he hit the jar against the blade of the shovel, breaking the top of the jar clean off. He quickly brought the jar to his mouth and licked the sploosh off the jagged edges before it spilled.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“有时候，你只能…”零蛋说着，把瓶子砸在铲片上，磕掉了瓶口。他迅速将罐子拿到嘴边，赶在斯蒲露溢出来之前舔掉了边缘的液体。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He wondered if Zero had heard of bacteria. He raised the jar to his mouth and carefully took a sip.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他怀疑零蛋可能从来没有听说过细菌这回事。他将瓶子举到嘴边，小心翼翼地抿了一小口。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Zero picked up the cracked lid and licked the sploosh off that as well. Then he handed the broken jar to Stanley. "Drink some."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="零蛋捡起开裂的盖子，把上面的液体也舔光了。然后，他把瓶子递给斯坦利。“喝点吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Zero smiled at him. "I told you it was good."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="零蛋冲他笑了笑。“我跟你说过的，很好喝。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Careful," Stanley warned.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“当心点。”斯坦利提醒道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Stanley held it in his hand and stared at it a moment. He was afraid of the broken glass. He was also afraid of the sploosh. It looked like mud. Whatever it was, he realized, it must have been in the boat when the boat sank. That meant it was probably over a hundred years old. Who knew what kind of bacteria might be living in it?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯坦利接过瓶子，打量了一会儿。他担心会有玻璃碴。他也不敢喝斯蒲露，它看起来就像是泥浆。他忽然想到无论斯蒲露是什么，小船沉入湖里的时候它们肯定在船上。这就是说它们有可能已经是上百年的老古董了。谁知道里面会生出什么样的细菌？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was a warm, bubbly, mushy nectar, sweet and tangy. It felt like heaven as it flowed over his dry mouth and down his parched throat. He thought it might have been some kind of fruit at some time, perhaps peaches.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那是一种温热、富有气泡、糊状的花蜜，味道甘甜，气味浓郁。当液体流入干干的嘴巴和干透的喉咙时，他觉得自己仿佛来到了天堂。他想这当初可能是某种水果，大概是桃子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Stanley didn't want to drink too much, but it was too good to resist. They passed the jar back and forth until it was empty. "How many are left?" he asked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯坦利不想喝太多，可是太可口了，忍不住想再尝尝。罐子在两人中间传来传去，直到空了为止。“还剩多少？”斯坦利问道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's good," said Zero, encouraging him.</div>

<div class="line_en">Stanley followed. Back outside, he had to shield his eyes from the brightness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯坦利跟在后面。爬出洞时，他不得不用手遮在眼睛上以躲避亮光。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Barf Bag stepped on a rattlesnake," said Zero.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“呕吐袋踩到了响尾蛇。”零蛋说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"They won't make you dig," Stanley promised. "They'll probably send you to a hospital, like Barf Bag."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他们不会再让你挖了。”斯坦利保证道，“他们可能会把你送到医院去，像呕吐袋那样。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Stanley's mouth dropped. "Now I have to take you back," he said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯坦利的嘴垂了下去。“现在，我得带你回去了。”他说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你猜的？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What's Mar-ya Luh-oh-oo?" asked Zero.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“‘玛——勒——伊，勒——乌’是什么？”零蛋问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He took off his shoe and sock first."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他先脱掉了鞋和袜子。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Stanley shivered as he tried to imagine it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯坦利想到那一幕不禁哆嗦起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Zero concentrated hard. "Mar ya, Luh oh oo."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="零蛋全神贯注。“玛——勒——伊，勒——乌。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“什么？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm not digging any more holes," said Zero.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我再也不挖洞了。”零蛋说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Stanley remembered how he'd almost done the same. "I guess he didn't hear the rattle."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯坦利想起自己也差点碰到同样的事情。“我猜他是没听到响尾蛇的响动。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'll show you," said Zero. He crawled back out from under the boat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我带你去看。”零蛋边说边爬出去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Zero walked around to the back of the boat and pointed to the upside-down letters. "Mm-ar-yuh. Luh-oh-oo."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="零蛋走到船背后，指着那行颠倒的字说：“玛——勒——伊，勒——乌。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Stanley smiled. "Mary Lou. It's the name of the boat."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯坦利笑了。“玛丽·露。这只船的名字。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Mary Lou," Zero repeated, studying the letters. "I thought 'y' made the 'yuh' sound."</div>

<div class="line_en">Zero managed to sit up. He took several deep breaths.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="零蛋挣扎着坐起来，深深地吸了几口气。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Stanley watched helplessly. He wondered if it was the sploosh. He looked back toward Camp Green Lake. At least he thought it was the direction of Camp Green Lake. He wasn't entirely sure.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯坦利无助地看着。他怀疑有可能是斯蒲露惹的祸。他回头朝翠湖营的方向望了望——至少他认为那是翠湖营的方向，但还是没有十足的把握。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Look, I got a plan so you won't get in trouble," Stanley assured him. "Remember when I found the gold tube. Remember, I gave it to X-Ray, and the Warden went crazy making us dig where she thought X-Ray found it. I think if I tell the Warden where I really found it, I think she'll let us off."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“听着，我都计划好了，你不会有麻烦的，”斯坦利向他保证，“记得我找到那根金色管子时发生的事情吗？记得吗？我把管子给了X光，管理员大人就拼命地逼着咱们在她以为找到管子的地方挖洞。我想，如果我把真正发现的地方告诉她，她会饶过咱俩。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Are you all right?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你没事吧？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It does," said Stanley. "But not when it's at the end of a word. Sometimes 'y' is a vowel and sometimes it's a consonant."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“的确如此，”斯坦利说，“只是当它出现在词尾的时候，情况就不一样了。有时候它是个元音，有时候它又成了辅音。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“那就让我死在这里吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Stanley didn't know what to do. He had come to rescue Zero and instead drank the last of his sploosh. He looked off into the distance. "I want you to look at something."</div>
