<div class="line_en">Others might have found refuge in a pint of whiskey, or a bottle of vodka, or a six-pack of beer. James, though, has never liked the taste of alcohol, and he finds it does not dull his mind; it only turns him a dark beet-red, as if he has endured some terrible battering, while his mind races all the faster. He takes long drives, crisscrossing Middlewood, following the highway almost to Cleveland before turning back. He takes sleeping pills from the drugstore, and even in his dreams, Lydia is dead. Again and again, he finds only one place where he can stop thinking: Louisa's bed.</div>

<div class="line_en">James is all too familiar with this kind of forgetting. From Lloyd Academy to Harvard to Middlewood, he has felt it every day -- that short-lived lull, then the sharp nudge to the ribs that reminded you that you didn't belong. It seemed a false comfort to him, like a zoo animal crouched in its cage, ignoring the gawking eyes, pretending it is still running wild. Now, a month after Lydia's funeral, he treasures those moments of forgetting.</div>

<div class="line_en">He tells Marilyn that he's going in to class, or to meet with students; on weekends, he says he has papers to grade. These are lies. The dean had canceled his summer class the week after Lydia's death. "Take some time for yourself, James," he had said, touching James gently on the shoulder. He did this with everyone he needed to soothe: students enraged over low grades, faculty slighted by the grants they did not receive. His job was to make losses feel smaller. But the students never turned their C-minuses into Bs; new funding never materialized. You never got what you wanted; you just learned to get by without it. And the last thing James wants is time for himself -- being at home is unbearable. At every moment, he expects Lydia to appear in the doorway, or to hear the squeak of her floorboards overhead. One morning, he heard footsteps in her room, and before he could stop himself, he ran upstairs, breathless, only to find Marilyn pacing before Lydia's desk, opening and closing her desk drawers. Get out, he wanted to shout, as if this were a sacred space. Now, every morning, he picks up his briefcase, as if he is going to teach, and drives in to the college. Even in his office, he finds himself mesmerized by the family photo on his desk, where Lydia -- barely fifteen, then -- peers out, ready to leap through the frame's glass and leave everyone behind. By afternoon, he finds himself at Louisa's apartment, plunging into her arms, then between her legs, where, blessedly, his mind shuts off.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他告诉玛丽琳，他要去上课，或者见学生；周末，他就说他要回学校批论文。这些都不是实话。莉迪亚死后一周，系主任取消了他的全部暑期课程。“给你自己留点时间，詹姆斯。”他和蔼地拍拍詹姆斯的肩膀。每当需要安抚别人——因为得了低分而暴跳如雷的学生、没得到福利的教职员工——的时候，系主任都会做这个动作。他的工作就是息事宁人。但是，即便这样，那些学生永远不会把C—变成B；新来的拨款也不会变成实际福利。你永远得不到你想要的；你只是学会了如何得过且过而已。詹姆斯最不想要的就是属于他自己的时间——待在家里是难以忍受的。他每时每刻都希望莉迪亚能出现在走廊里，或者听到楼上她房间里的地板吱呀作响的声音。一天早晨，他听到莉迪亚房间里有脚步声，立刻不假思索地冲上楼，结果发现是玛丽琳在莉迪亚的书桌前踱步，把她的所有抽屉打开再关上。“出去。”他很想这么喊，好像这里是一块圣地。现在，每天早晨他都会拿起公事包，像平时上课一样，开车去学校。在办公室，他会无意识地对着桌上的全家福发呆，照片上的莉迪亚——还不到十五岁——看着他，好像随时都能跳出相框，把其他人甩在身后。到了下午，他会不由自主地去路易莎的公寓，投入她的两臂之间，然后是两腿之间，在那里，他的大脑会陷入一片幸福的空白。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But after leaving Louisa's, he remembers again, and he is always angrier than before. On the way back to his car one evening, he seizes a stray bottle from the street and hurls it into the side of Louisa's building. Other nights, he fights the temptation to steer into a tree. Nath and Hannah try to stay out of his way, and he and Marilyn have barely exchanged a word in weeks. As the Fourth of July approaches, James passes the lake and finds that someone has festooned the dock with bunting and red and white balloons. He swerves to the side of the road and rips it all down, bursting each balloon under his heel. When everything has sunk beneath the surface of the water, and the dock lies solemn and barren, he heads home, still shaking.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，离开路易莎家，他又会想起一切，甚至变得比原先还要愤怒。一天晚上，他走向自己的车，顺手拎起路边的一个空瓶子，朝着路易莎住的公寓楼使劲一扔。有时候，他会在与怒火的搏斗中把车朝树开去。内斯和汉娜都尽量躲着他走，他和玛丽琳有时一连几周都不怎么说话。七月四日快到了，詹姆斯路过湖边，发现码头上装饰了彩旗，还有红色和白色的气球。他跑过去扯下所有彩旗，把气球逐一踩破。当所有装饰都沉入湖水，整个码头显得寥落而萧索的时候，他才颤抖着回家。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Sorry," Nath says. He cups a hard-boiled egg in one hand, a paper napkin in the other. "I didn't expect you." Out of the car, with its lingering air of exhaust and engine grease, James realizes he can smell Louisa's perfume on his skin, musky and spicy-sweet. He wonders if Nath can, too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“对不起。”内斯说，他一手握着个煮鸡蛋，另一手捏着张餐巾纸，“我没想到是你。”詹姆斯想起，当他钻出汽车，呼吸到掺杂了汽车尾气和发动机油味道的空气时，突然发觉，他能在自己的皮肤上闻到路易莎的香水味——是一种麝香和甜香的混合气味，他怀疑内斯也能闻到。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The sight of Nath rummaging in the refrigerator sets him ablaze again. "You're wasting power," James says. Nath shuts the door, and his quiet obedience only makes James angrier. "Do you always have to be in the way?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"For your information," he says, "my summer course comes with a great deal of responsibility. And I have conferences. Meetings." His face flushes at the memory of that afternoon -- Louisa kneeling before his chair, then slowly unzipping his fly -- and this makes him angry. Nath stares, lips slightly pursed, as if he wants to frame a question but can't get past the W --, and suddenly, James is furious. For as long as he has been a father, James has believed that Lydia looked like her mother -- beautiful, blue-eyed, poised -- and that Nath looked like him: dark, hesitating in midspeech, preparing to stumble over his own words. He forgets, most of the time, that Lydia and Nath resemble each other, too. Now, in Nath's face, James suddenly sees a flash of his daughter, wide-eyed and silent, and the pain of this makes him cruel. "You're just home all day. Do you have any friends at all?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你最好知道，”他说，“我的暑期课程非常繁重，还要开好几个会。”想起当天下午的事情，他的脸红了——路易莎跪在他的椅子前面，慢慢拉开他的裤链——而脸红让他愤怒。内斯凝视着他，嘴唇微微撅起，似乎想发问，但是难以启齿。詹姆斯突然火冒三丈，因为，自从做了父亲以来，詹姆斯一直觉得莉迪亚像她母亲——美丽、蓝眼睛、沉稳，内斯则像他，忧郁、讲话吞吞吐吐。大多数时候，他却忘记了莉迪亚和内斯也相像这个事实。现在，他猛然在内斯的脸上发现了莉迪亚的影子：大眼睛，性格安静。想到这里，他愈发难以忍受：“整天都待在家里，你难道没有朋友吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What do you mean, you didn't expect me?" he says. "Don't I have a right to come into my own kitchen after a hard day of work?" He sets his bag down. "Where's your mother?"</div>

<div class="line_en">His father has said things like this for years, but at this moment Nath feels something snap, like an overstretched wire. "None. I'm not like you. No conferences. No -- meetings." He wrinkles his nose. "You smell like perfume. From your meetings, I guess?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这样的话，他父亲说了很多年，但是这一次，内斯感觉什么东西断掉了，仿佛一根拉伸过度的线。“没有，我又不像你，我不用……开会。”他皱皱鼻子，“你身上有香水味，是开会开的，对吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Nath's expression doesn't change, but his whole face stiffens, like a mask. James wants to snatch the words back out of the air, like moths, but they've already crawled into his son's ears: he can see it in Nath's eyes, which have gone shiny and hard as glass. He wants to reach out and touch his son -- his hand, his shoulder, anywhere -- and tell him he didn't mean it. That none of this is his fault. Then Nath punches the countertop so hard it leaves a crack in the old, worn laminate. He runs out of the room, footsteps thundering up the stairs, and James lets his bag fall to the floor and slumps back against the counter. His hand touches something cold and wet: the crushed remains of the hard-boiled egg, shards of shell driven deep into the tender white.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="内斯的表情没变，但他的整张脸都僵了，犹如扣着面具。詹姆斯很想像抓蛾子那样把刚才说的话抓回来，但那些字句已经钻进了儿子的耳朵。他能从内斯的眼睛里看出来，内斯的眼神变得冰冷僵硬，像玻璃一样。他想伸手碰碰儿子——碰他的手、他的肩膀，随便什么地方——告诉他自己不是故意的，这件事不是儿子的错。这时，内斯一拳打向柜台，在老旧的台面上砸出一条裂缝。他朝自己的房间跑去，跺得楼梯咚咚直响。詹姆斯的包滑落在地，他无力地靠在柜台上，手触到一个冰冷潮湿的东西：被捏碎的煮鸡蛋。锋利的蛋壳深深插进了柔软的蛋白里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">James grabs him by the shoulder, so hard his knuckles crack. "Don't you talk to me that way," he says. "Don't you question me. You don't know anything about my life." Then, before he even realizes the words are forming, they shoot from his mouth like spit. "Just like you didn't know anything about your sister's."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="詹姆斯一把拽过儿子的肩膀，非常用力，连指关节都在响。“不许你这样和我说话，”他说，“不许这样问我。你根本不了解我的生活。”然后，他不假思索地脱口而出，“就像你根本不了解你妹妹的生活一样。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">All night he thinks about this, his son's frozen face, and the next morning he rises early. Retrieving the newspaper from the front porch, he sees the date black and stark in the corner: July 3. Two months to the day since Lydia disappeared. It doesn't seem possible that just two months ago he had sat in his office grading papers, that he had been embarrassed to pluck a ladybug from Louisa's hair. Until two months ago, July 3 had been a happy date, secretly treasured for ten years -- the day of Marilyn's miraculous return. How everything has changed. In the kitchen, James slides the rubber band from the newspaper and unrolls it. There, below the fold, he sees a small headline: Teachers and Classmates Remember Departed Girl. The articles about Lydia have grown shorter and sparser. Soon they would stop entirely, and everyone would forget about her. James cups the paper toward him. The day is cloudy, but he leaves the light off, as if the dimness will soften what he's about to read. From Karen Adler: She seemed lonely. She didn't really hang out with anyone. From Pam Saunders: She didn't have a lot of friends, or even a boyfriend. I don't think the boys even noticed her. At the bottom: Lee's physics teacher, Donald Kelly, remembered her as the lone sophomore in a class of juniors, noting, "She worked hard, but of course she stood out." Beside the article, a sidebar: Children of Mixed Backgrounds Often Struggle to Find Their Place.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他一晚上都在想这件事，眼前全是儿子僵硬的脸。次日清晨，他早早起来，从门廊里拿来报纸，看到上面的黑体日期：七月三日。莉迪亚消失两个月了。两个月前，他还在办公室批改论文，含羞带怯地帮路易莎捉头上的甲虫；两个月前，七月三日还是个快乐的日子，还是个十年来都让他打心底里珍惜的日子——这是玛丽琳奇迹般归来的日子。世事真是无常。詹姆斯走进厨房，取下捆在报纸上的橡皮筋。翻开报纸，他看到一行小标题：《师生纪念逝去的女孩》。最近，有关莉迪亚的文章越来越短，也越来越少，它们很快就会完全消失，大家也会忘记她这个人。詹姆斯捧起报纸。外面阴着天，但他没有开灯，似乎暗淡的光线能够柔化他即将读到的内容。卡伦·阿德勒说：她显得挺孤独，她不和任何人来往。帕姆·桑德斯说：她没有太多朋友，连男朋友都没有。我不觉得男孩们会注意她。最底部，李的物理老师唐纳德·凯利回忆道：她是一个孤独的高一学生，上着高二的物理课。凯利说：“她学习努力，但是，她显然不合群。”文章旁边有一条补充报道：来自混血家庭背景的孩子，通常难以找到自己的定位。">查看中文翻译</div>

In that instant, a tiny part of him shouts that it's all a mix-up, a case of mistaken identity, a bad dream.

Chinese -- if it is mentioned at all -- is a kind of checkers, a kind of fire drill, a kind of takeout, one James doesn't care for. It did not bear discussion any more than that the sky was up, or that the earth circled the sun. He had naively thought that -- unlike with Marilyn's mother, unlike with everyone else -- this thing made no difference to them. Now, when Marilyn says this -- If she were a white girl -- it proves what James has feared all along. That inside, all along, she'd labeled everything. White and not white. That this thing makes all the difference in the world.</div>

<div class="line_en">Marilyn, still fuming at the police, does not understand, and her confusion makes her angrier. "What do you mean?" Under the kitchen light, her wrists are pale and thin, her lips set, her face cold. James remembers: long ago, when they were young and the worst thing they could imagine was not being together, he had once leaned in to touch her, and his fingertips had left a trail of goose bumps across her shoulder blade. Every tiny hair on his arm had stood up, electrified. That moment, that connection, seems far away and small now, like something that happened in another life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛丽琳还在生警察的气，她没听明白詹姆斯的话，困惑加深了她的愤怒。“你是什么意思？”在厨房的灯光下，她的手腕显得苍白瘦削，嘴唇黯淡无光，脸色冰冷。詹姆斯记得，很久以前，在他们年轻的时候，能够想到的最可怕的事就是不能在一起。有一次，他伸出手来抚摸她的背，她觉得自己肩胛上的汗毛都竖起来了，他的手指仿佛带着电流一样。现在，那种时刻已经一去不复返，一切恍如隔世。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For moving would never have been enough; he sees that now. It would have been the same anywhere. Children of Mixed Backgrounds Often Struggle to Find Their Place. The mistake was earlier, deeper, more fundamental: it had happened the morning they'd married, when the justice of the peace had looked at Marilyn and she had said yes. Or earlier, on that first afternoon they'd spent together, when he had stood beside the bed, naked and shy, and she had twined her legs around his waist and pulled him toward her. Earlier yet: on that first day, when she'd leaned across his desk and kissed him, knocking the breath out of him like a swift, sharp punch. A million little chances to change the future. They should never have married. He should never have touched her. She should have turned around, stepped out of his office into the hallway, walked away. He sees with utter clarity: none of this was supposed to happen. A mistake.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他意识到，搬到米德伍德不是理由，因为在哪里都一样。来自混血家庭背景的孩子，通常难以找到自己的定位。所以说，这个错误更久远，更深刻，更根本。它就发生在他们结婚的那天上午，治安法官看着玛丽琳，她说“我愿意”的时候。抑或是他们共同度过第一个下午的时候，他站在床边，赤裸羞涩，她的腿缠在他腰上，把他拉过去。甚至更早，她隔着桌子亲他的那一刻，像是恰到好处地打了他一拳，令他无法呼吸。总之，存在一百万种改变未来的微小可能性。他们不应该结婚，他不应该碰她，她应该转身离开他的办公室。他已经彻底看明白了，这些都不应该发生，都是错误。">查看中文翻译</div>

It's only quarter to nine, and James hears the questions that ripple behind her surprise: Has he come to stay? What about his wife? He does not know the answers.

<div class="line_en">He does not wait for her to wrap her arms around him, as if he is a small and hesitant child, or for her to coax him into the bedroom. Instead he pushes her to the floor as he reaches for his fly, tugging her skirt up and pulling her onto him right there in the living room. Louisa moans, arching her back, and James fumbles with the buttons on her blouse, peeling it away and unsnapping her bra and catching her breasts, heavy and round, in his cupped hands. As she grinds herself against him, he focuses on her face, on the dark hair that tumbles down into his mouth, on the deep brown eyes that close as her breath grows faster, her thrusts more urgent. This is the sort of woman, he thinks, he should have fallen in love with. A woman who looked just like this. A woman just like him.</div>

<div class="line_en">At home, when Nath and Hannah come downstairs, Marilyn sits motionless at the kitchen table. Though it is past ten o'clock, she is wearing her bathrobe still, hugged so tightly around her that they cannot see her neck, and they know there is bad news even before she chokes out the word suicide. "Was it?" Nath asks slowly, and, turning for the stairs without looking at either of them, Marilyn says only, "They say it was."</div>

<div class="line_en">For half an hour, Nath pokes at the dregs of cereal in the bottom of his bowl while Hannah watches him nervously. He has been checking the Wolffs' house every day, looking for Jack, trying to catch him -- though for what, he isn't quite sure. One time he even climbed the porch steps and peeked in the window, but no one is ever home. Jack's VW hasn't puttered down the street in days. At last, Nath pushes the bowl away and reaches for the telephone. "Get out," he says to Hannah. "I want to make a phone call." Halfway up the stairs, Hannah pauses, listening to the slow clicks as Nath dials. "Officer Fiske," he says after a moment, "this is Nathan Lee. I'm calling about my sister." His voice drops, and only bits and pieces come through: Ought to reexamine. Tried to talk to him. Acting evasive. Toward the end, only one word is audible. Jack. Jack. As if Nath cannot say the name without spitting.</div>

<div class="line_en">After Nath puts the phone down, so hard the bells jangle, he shuts himself in his room. They think he's being hysterical, but he knows there's something there, that there's some connection to Jack, some missing piece of the puzzle. If the police don't believe him, his parents won't either. His father is hardly home these days anyway, and his mother has locked herself in Lydia's room again; through the wall he can hear her pacing, like a prowling cat. Hannah raps at his door, and he puts on a record, loud, until he can't hear the sound of her knuckles, or his mother's footsteps, anymore. Later, none of them will remember how the day passes, only a numbed blur, overshadowed by all that would happen the next day.</div>

<div class="line_en">When evening falls, Hannah opens her door and peers through the crack. A razor of light slices under Nath's door, another under Lydia's. All afternoon Nath had played his record over and over, but he has finally let it wind to a stop, and now a thick silence, like fog, seeps out onto the landing. Tiptoeing downstairs, she finds the house dark, her father still gone. The kitchen faucet drips: plink, plink, plink. She knows she should turn it off, but then the house will be silent, and at the moment this is unbearable. Back in her room, she imagines the faucet dripping to itself in the kitchen. With every plink, another bead of water would form on the brushed steel of the sink.</div>

<div class="line_en">She longs to climb into her sister's bed and sleep, but with her mother there, she cannot, and to console herself, Hannah circles the room, checking her treasures, pulling each from its hiding place and examining it. Tucked between mattress and box spring: the smallest spoon from her mother's tea set. Behind the books on the shelf: her father's old wallet, the leather worn thin as tissue. A pencil of Nath's, his toothmarks revealing wood grain beneath the yellow paint. These are her failures. The successes are all gone: the ring on which her father kept his office keys; her mother's best lipstick, Rose Petal Frost; the mood ring Lydia used to wear on her thumb. They were wanted and missed and hunted down in Hannah's hands. These aren't a toy, said her father. You're too young for makeup, said her mother. Lydia had been more blunt: Stay out of my things. Hannah had folded her hands behind her back, savoring the lecture, nodding solemnly as she memorized the shape of them standing there beside the bed. When they were gone, she repeated each sentence under her breath, redrawing them in the empty spot where they'd been.</div>

It made its slow way between his shoulder blades, and where his back curved, it dropped straight down, as if it had jumped off a cliff, and splashed onto the back of Jack's hand. Nath, facing away from Jack, didn't see it, and neither did Lydia, peeking up through the slits between her fingers. Only Hannah, arms curled around knees, a little way behind them, saw it fall. In her ears, it made a noise, like a cannon shot. And Jack himself jumped. He stared at the drop of water without moving, as if it were a rare insect that might fly away. Then, without looking at any of them, he raised his hand to his mouth and touched his tongue to it, as if it were honey.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我没事。”莉迪亚又说，她用另一只手把他拍到一边，重新躺了下来，“你比妈妈还唠叨，别大惊小怪的，让我一个人待着。”这时，一件事吸引了汉娜的注意力，所以她没有听到内斯接下来说了什么。一滴水顺着内斯的头发移动到他的脖子上，好像一只害羞的小老鼠，慢慢地从他的肩胛骨之间流下来，沿着脊背的曲线一直向下，犹如跳下一座悬崖一样，落到了杰克的手背上。这一幕，背对着杰克的内斯根本发觉不了，正透过指缝向外张望的莉迪亚也不会注意。只有抱着膝盖，稍微坐得靠后一点的汉娜看到那滴水落了下来——在她听来，那溅落的声音像炮弹一样响。只见杰克一下子跳了起来。他盯着那滴水，却没再动，好像那是一只稀有的昆虫，可能随时会振翅飞走。然后，他没有看他们中的任何一个人，只是盯着那滴水。他抬起手放到嘴边，用舌头把它舔掉，简直像在品尝甜美的蜂蜜。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It happened so quickly that if she were a different person, Hannah might have wondered if she'd imagined it. No one else saw. Nath was still turned away; Lydia had her eyes shut now against the sun. But the moment flashed lightning-bright to Hannah. Years of yearning had made her sensitive, the way a starving dog twitches its nostrils at the faintest scent of food. She could not mistake it. She recognized it at once: love, one-way deep adoration that bounced off and did not bounce back; careful, quiet love that didn't care and went on anyway. It was too familiar to be surprising. Something deep inside her stretched out and curled around Jack like a shawl, but he didn't notice. His gaze moved away to the far side of the lake, as if nothing had happened. She stretched her leg and touched her bare foot to Jack's, big toe to big toe, and only then did he look down at her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一切发生得如此之快，汉娜甚至觉得这一幕是她想象出来的，其他人都没有看到。内斯依旧背对着杰克，为了对抗阳光，莉迪亚闭上了眼睛。刚才的那个瞬间，如闪电一般令汉娜觉得震撼。多年来对爱的渴求让她变得敏锐，她就像一条饥饿的狗，不停地翕动鼻孔，捕捉着哪怕是最微弱的食物香气。她不会弄错的。她一看到就认出了它。那是爱，是一厢情愿的深切渴慕，只有付出，得不到回报；是小心翼翼而安静的爱恋，却无所畏惧，无论如何，都会执着地进行下去。这种感情太过熟悉，她一点都不觉得惊讶。她的内心深处仿佛生发出某种东西，钻出她的身体，像披风一样包裹着杰克，而他却没有发觉。他的目光早已移动到了湖的对岸，似乎什么都没有发生过。汉娜伸过腿去，拿光脚碰了碰杰克的脚，两个人的大脚趾相对。这时，杰克才低头看她。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Hey, kiddo," he said, ruffling her hair with his hand. Her whole scalp had tingled and she thought her hair might stand up, like static electricity. At the sound of Jack's voice, Nath glanced over.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嘿，小毛孩。”他说着，抬手揉了揉她的头发。她立刻觉得整块头皮发麻，每一根头发都竖了起来，仿佛过电一样。听到杰克的声音，内斯看了过来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">On Lydia's bed, Marilyn hugs her knees like a little girl, trying to leap the gaps between what James has said and what he thinks and what he meant. Your mother was right all along. You should have married someone more like you. With such bitterness in his voice that it choked her. These words sound familiar and she mouths them silently, trying to place them. Then she remembers. On their wedding day, in the courthouse: her mother had warned her about their children, how they wouldn't fit in anywhere. You'll regret it, she had said, as if they would be flippered and imbecile and doomed, and out in the lobby, James must have heard everything. Marilyn had said only, My mother just thinks I should marry someone more like me, then brushed it away, like dust onto the floor. But those words had haunted James. How they must have wound around his heart, binding tighter over the years, slicing into the flesh. He had hung his head like a murderer, as if his blood were poison, as if he regretted that their daughter had ever existed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛丽琳在莉迪亚的床上像个小女孩那样抱住膝盖，仔细回忆詹姆斯说的话，琢磨他的想法和意思。“你母亲一直是对的，你应该嫁给一个更像你的人。”他声音里的苦涩让她觉得呼吸困难。这些话听起来很熟悉，她不出声地复述了一遍，努力回忆着。然后，她想起来了。在他们结婚那天的法院大楼里，她母亲提醒她，要为他们将来的孩子想想，他们可能走到哪里都不合群。“你会后悔的。”她当时说，仿佛他们是两个在劫难逃的傻瓜。在门厅里等着的詹姆斯一定听到了她们的每一句对话。玛丽琳只告诉他：“我母亲觉得我应该嫁给一个更像我的人。”然后她就遗忘了这件事，把它像尘土一样丢在了地上。但这些话一直让詹姆斯忧心忡忡，不得安宁，像尖刀一样划开他的皮肉，刺进他的心，让他像个自动站上绞刑架的杀人犯，让他觉得自己的血统害人不浅，让他后悔生下了莉迪亚这个女儿。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Stay away from my sister," Nath said to Jack, very quietly, as they left. Lydia, already walking away, shaking grass off her towel, didn't hear, but Hannah had. It sounded like Nath had meant her -- Hannah -- but she knew he'd really meant Lydia. When they stopped at the corner to let a car pass, she peeked back over her shoulder, one quick glance too fast for Nath to notice. Jack was watching them go. Anyone would think he was looking at Lydia, with the towel slung around her hips now, like a sarong. Hannah shot him a little smile, but he didn't smile back, and she could not tell if he hadn't seen her, or if her one little smile hadn't been enough.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“离我妹妹远点。”内斯对杰克说，语气非常平静。然后，他们就离开了。莉迪亚已经走出一段距离，正抖着毛巾上的草。她没听到内斯刚才的话，但汉娜听到了。内斯口中的“妹妹”听起来好像指的是她——汉娜，但她明白，他的真实所指是莉迪亚。当他们在街角停下来等路上的车过去时，汉娜扭头向后看了一眼——为了不让内斯发现，她的动作非常迅速。她发现杰克在后面看着他们向前走。任何人都会觉得他是在看莉迪亚；莉迪亚把毛巾围在腰上，好像东南亚人穿的莎笼。汉娜朝着杰克微微一笑，但他没有对她笑，她也不确定他是否看到了她，抑或是她的一个小小微笑不足以得到他的回报。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Hannah," he said, and without knowing why, she stood up. Nath nudged Lydia with his foot. "Let's go." Lydia groaned but picked up her towel and the bottle of baby oil.</div>

<div class="line_en">Except James does not come home. Not at dinner; not at nightfall; not at one, when the bars in town close. All night Marilyn sits awake, pillows propped against the headboard, waiting for the sound of his car in the driveway, his footsteps on the stairs. At three, when he still hasn't come home, she decides she will go to his office. All the way to campus, she pictures him huddled in his wheeled armchair, crushed with sadness, soft cheek pressed to hard desk. When she finds him, she thinks, she will convince him this is not his fault. She will bring him home. But when she pulls into the lot, it is empty. She circles his building three times, checking all the spots where he usually parks, then all the faculty lots, then all the meters nearby. No sign of him anywhere.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，詹姆斯并没有回家。晚饭时没回，天黑时没有，凌晨一点也没有——那是镇上的酒吧打烊的时间。玛丽琳坐了一宿，她倚着斜靠在床头板上的枕头，等待他的车开进车道的声音和他走上楼梯的脚步声。凌晨三点，他依旧没回家，她决定到他办公室去看看。去学校的路上，她想，他也许正蜷缩在转椅上，脸枕着桌子，被悲伤压垮了。找到他之后，她就能让他明白，这不是他的错，然后带他回家。但是，当她来到停车场，却发现这里一辆车都没有。她围着办公楼转了三圈，察看了所有他可能停车的地点和全部教职工的停车位，又在周围转了一圈，都是一无所获。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When James comes home, Marilyn thinks, speechless with aching, she will tell him: I would marry you a hundred times if it gave us Lydia. A thousand times. You cannot blame yourself for this.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the morning, when the children come downstairs, Marilyn sits stiff-necked and bleary-eyed at the kitchen table. "Where's Daddy?" Hannah asks, and her silence is enough of an answer. It is the Fourth of July: everything is closed. James has no friends on the faculty; he is not close with their neighbors; he loathes the dean. Could he have been in an accident? Should she call the police? Nath rubs his bruised knuckle across the crack in the counter and remembers the perfume on his father's skin, his reddening cheeks, his sharp and sudden fury. I don't owe him anything, he thinks, but even so, he has the feeling of leaping off a high cliff when he swallows hard and says at last, "Mom? I think I know where he is."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="早晨孩子们下楼时，玛丽琳脖子僵硬、两眼模糊地坐在厨房桌前。“爸爸呢？”汉娜问，母亲的沉默已经回答了她。今天是七月四日，一切都落下了帷幕。詹姆斯在同事中没有朋友，他和邻居们也不熟，他不喜欢系主任。他会不会出了事故？她应该报警吗？内斯淤青的指关节划过柜台上的裂缝，想起父亲身上的香水味和变红的脸，他的敏感和突然的愤怒。“我又没有亏欠他。”他想。但即使这样，当他硬下心肠终于开口的时候，依然有一种跃下高耸悬崖的感觉：“妈妈，我想我知道他在哪儿。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Fourth Street is near the college, a student-heavy area of town, and even as she turns down it, squinting at building numbers, Marilyn has no plan. Maybe, she thinks, Nath is all wrong, maybe she is making a fool of herself. She feels like an overtuned violin, strung too tight, so that even the slightest vibration sets her humming. Then, in front of number 97, she sees James's car, parked beneath a scrubby maple. Four stray leaves dot its windshield.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第四大街在大学附近，这里住着很多学生，在门牌号码之间搜寻的时候，玛丽琳的心里还是没底。她想，也许内斯错了，也许她会出洋相。她觉得自己像一把弦绷得太紧的小提琴，即使最微不足道的振动，也会让她嗡嗡作响。接着，她在97号门口看到了詹姆斯的车，就停在一棵矮小的枫树下，挡风玻璃上沾着四片落叶。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At first Marilyn will not believe it. It is so unlike James. Besides, she thinks, he doesn't know anyone. He does not have any female friends.
