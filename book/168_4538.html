<div class="line_en">Joffrey should have met the Dornishmen himself, he reflected as he sat waiting, but he would have mucked it up, no doubt. Of late the king had been repeating little jests about the Dornish that he'd picked up from Mace Tyrell's men-atarms. How many Dornishmen does it take to shoe a horse? Nine. One to do the shoeing, and eight to lift the horse up. Somehow Tyrion did not think Doran Martell would find that amusing.</div>

<div class="line_en">He could see their banners flying as the riders emerged from the green of the living wood in a long dusty column. From here to the river, only bare black trees remained, a legacy of his battle. Too many banners, he thought sourly, as he watched the ashes kick up under the hooves of the approaching horses, as they had beneath the hooves of the Tyrell van as it smashed Stannis in the flank. Martell's brought half the lords of Dorne, by the look of it. He tried to think of some good that might come of that, and failed. "How many banners do you count?" he asked Brorm.</div>

There were the salty Dornishmen who lived along the coasts, the sandy Dornishmen of the deserts and long river valleys, and the stony Dornishmen who made their fastnesses in the passes and heights of the Red Mountains. The salty Domishmen had the most Rhoynish blood, the stony Dornishmen the least.</div>

The sandy Dornishmen were even darker, their faces burned brown by the hot Dornish sun. They wound long bright scarfs around their helms to ward off sunstroke. The stony Dornishmen were biggest and fairest, sons of the Andals and the First Men, brownhaired or blond, with faces that freckled or burned in the sun instead of browning.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这次道朗的队伍里面，三大族群悉数到场。他们特征明显：“盐人”柔软黝黑，有橄榄色的光滑皮肤和风中飘荡的黑长发；“沙人”黑的程度更甚，他们不堪多恩领日光的强烈照射，因此惯于在头盔上扎明亮的长围巾；“石人”在三者中身材最棒、也最美丽，他们是安达尔人和先民的后代，棕发或金发，不过面孔稍因多恩的日照而显得粗糙。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The lords wore silk and satin robes with jeweled belts and flowing sleeves. Their armor was heavily enameled and inlaid with burnished copper, shining silver, and soft red gold. They came astride red horses and golden ones and a few as pale as snow, all slim and swift, with long necks and narrow beautiful heads. The fabled sand steeds of Dome were smaller than proper warhorses and could not bear such weight of armor, but it was said that they could run for a day and night and another day, and never tire.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Dwarf," said the Red Viper, in a tone grown markedly less cordial, "spare me your Lannister lies. Is it sheep you take us for, or fools? My brother is not a bloodthirsty man, but neither has he been asleep for sixteen years. Jon Arryn came to Sunspear the year after Robert took the throne, and you can be sure that he was questioned closely. Him, and a hundred more. I did not come for some mummer's show of an inquiry. I came for justice for Elia and her children, and I will have it. Starting with this lummox Gregor Clegane… but not, I think, ending there. Before he dies, the Enormity That Rides will tell me whence came his orders, please assure your lord father of that." He smiled.

<div class="line_en">Tyrion could see the sun shining on the Blackwater Rush half a mile ahead, and on the walls and towers and hills of King's Landing beyond. He glanced over his shoulder, at the glittering column following them up the kingsroad. "You speak like a man with a great host at his back," he said, "yet all I see are three hundred. Do you spy that city there, north of the river?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="前方半里处，阳光在黑水河上照耀，也洒在河对岸君临城的墙垒、塔堡和殿堂上。提利昂回头，望着沿国王大道跟随而行的大队人马。“听您口气，倒像手握重兵的元帅，”他说，“但我仔细数了数，您不过带来三百人。请您瞧瞧河对面，看见什么了吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Then take a good sniff, my lord. Fill up your nose. Half a million people stink more than three hundred, you'll find. Do you smell the gold cloaks? There are near five thousand of them. My father's own swom swords must account for another twenty thousand. And then there are the roses. Roses smell so sweet, don't they? Especially when there are so many of them. Fifty, sixty, seventy thousand roses, in the city or camped outside it, I can't really say how many are left, but there's more than I care to count, anyway."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“您应该好好闻闻，亲王殿下，仔细地闻。五十万人发出的臭气当然比三百人身上的强，这您总该知道。闻到金袍子的味道了吗？他们约有五千。我父亲大人自己的部队则将近两万。您可别忘了，城内实力最强的是玫瑰。玫瑰闻起来很香甜，对不对？尤其是这么多合在一起，确实不一般。五万、六万，甚至多达七万枝玫瑰，插在城市内，或城郊的旷野上，其中有一些正在外面打仗，但留下来的，也数不胜数。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Domishman did not react as expected. "I had a letter from Willas not half a year past. We share an interest in fine horseflesh. He has never borne me any ill will for what happened in the lists. I struck his breastplate clean, but his foot caught in a stirrup as he fell and his horse came down on top of him. I sent a maester to him afterward, but it was all he could do to save the boy's leg. The knee was far past mending. If any were to blame, it was his fool of a father. Willas Tyrell was green as his surcoat and had no business riding in such company. The Fat Flower thrust him into tourneys at too tender an age, just as he did with the other two. He wanted another Leo Longthom, and made himself a cripple."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="多恩人的反应没有预想中的激烈。“快半年前，我刚收到维拉斯的信，我们对烹调马肉有着共同的爱好。关于比武会上的意外，他从未责怪我。事实上，我正中他胸甲，但他的脚不幸被缠在马镫里，结果摔下去，反被坐骑压住。我派出自己的学士为他医治，但学士只能保住大腿，膝盖已全碎了。真要怪的话，得怪他的蠢老爸。当年的维拉斯·提利尔嫩得跟青草似的，怎能要他参加如此激烈的比武？那死胖子以为他和他两个弟弟一样，生来就该在比武会中建立功勋，他想得到一个‘长枪’里奥，却让自己的长子成了残废。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You want to die with a breast in hand, you said." Tyrion cantered on ahead to where the ferry barges waited on the south bank of the Blackwater. He had suffered all he meant to suffer of what passed for Dornish wit. Father should have sent Joffrey after all. He could have asked Prince Oberyn if he knew how a Dornishman differed from a cowflop. That made him grin despite himself. He would have to make a point of being on hand when the Red Viper was presented to the king.</div>
