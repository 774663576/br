<div class="line_en">At this moment his mother was sitting in some place deep down beneath him, with his young sister in her arms. He did not remember his sister at all, except as a tiny, feeble baby, always silent, with large, watchful eyes. Both of them were looking up at him. They were down in some subterranean place -- the bottom of a well, for instance, or a very deep grave -- but it was a place which, already far below him, was itself moving downwards. They were in the saloon of a sinking ship, looking up at him through the darkening water. There was still air in the saloon, they could still see him and he them, but all the while they were sinking down, down into the green waters which in another moment must hide them from sight for ever. He was out in the light and air while they were being sucked down to death, and they were down there because he was up here. He knew it and they knew it, and he could see the knowledge in their faces. There was no reproach either in their faces or in their hearts, only the knowledge that they must die in order that he might remain alive, and that this was part of the unavoidable order of things.</div>

<div class="line_en">He could not remember what had happened, but he knew in his dream that in some way the lives of his mother and his sister had been sacrificed to his own. It was one of those dreams which, while retaining the characteristic dream scenery, are a continuation of one's intellectual life, and in which one becomes aware of facts and ideas which still seem new and valuable after one is awake. The thing that now suddenly struck Winston was that his mother's death, nearly thirty years ago, had been tragic and sorrowful in a way that was no longer possible. Tragedy, he perceived, belonged to the ancient time, to a time when there was still privacy, love and friendship, and when the members of a family stood by one another without needing to know the reason. His mother's memory tore at his heart because she had died loving him, when he was too young and selfish to love her in return, and because somehow, he did not remember how, she had sacrificed herself to a conception of loyalty that was private and unalterable. Such things, he saw, could not happen today. Today there were fear, hatred and pain, but no dignity of emotion, no deep or complex sorrows. All this he seemed to see in the large eyes of his mother and his sister, looking up at him through the green water, hundreds of fathoms down and still sinking.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他不记得发生了什么，但他在梦中知道，某种程度上，他母亲和他妹妹是为他而牺牲的。这是一个这样的梦：在保留了特有的梦境的同时，又延续着梦者的精神生活，梦者即使醒来，他在梦中意识到的事实和观念仍是新鲜和有价值的。眼下温斯顿突然想到的是，三十年前他母亲的死，悲惨而哀伤，如今已不太可能了。他想，悲剧属于古代，那时仍然有私生活、恩爱和友谊，那时家庭成员互相帮助而无需问为什么。他对母亲的记忆撕扯着他的心灵，因为他母亲为爱他而死，而他那时年幼、自私，不能回报母亲的爱，因为某种程度上——他记不确切了——她是出于一种内心的、不可改变的忠诚观念而牺牲她自己的。他知道，这种事情今天不会再发生了。今天不乏恐惧、仇恨和痛苦，但没有情感上的尊严，没有深沉和复杂的悲伤。这就是他似乎从母亲和妹妹的大眼睛中看到的，她们透过绿色的海水仰望着他，虽然身处极深的水下，并不断下沉。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Suddenly he was standing on short springy turf, on a summer evening when the slanting rays of the sun gilded the ground. The landscape that he was looking at recurred so often in his dreams that he was never fully certain whether or not he had seen it in the real world. In his waking thoughts he called it the Golden Country. It was an old, rabbit-bitten pasture, with a foot-track wandering across it and a molehill here and there. In the ragged hedge on the opposite side of the field the boughs of the elm trees were swaying very faintly in the breeze, their leaves just stirring in dense masses like women's hair. Somewhere near at hand, though out of sight, there was a clear, slow-moving stream where dace were swimming in the pools under the willow trees.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然，他站在了一小块松软的草地上，那是一个夏天的傍晚，夕阳给大地抹上一片金色。他正在欣赏的这一风景在他梦中一再出现，以致他难以确定在现实生活中他是否见过这一景色。在他醒来的思绪中，他称其为黄金乡。这是一片古老的、被兔子啃过的草地，有一条踩出来的小路通过，到处是鼹鼠打洞扒出的土堆。在草地的另一头，参差不齐的篱笆上方，榆树枝在微风中轻轻摇曳，树叶在暮色中颤动，犹如女子的头发。在近处，虽然看不见，有一条清澈、缓缓流动的溪流，柳树下的池塘里有鱼儿游弋。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The girl with dark hair was coming towards him across the field. With what seemed a single movement she tore off her clothes and flung them disdainfully aside. Her body was white and smooth, but it aroused no desire in him, indeed he barely looked at it. What overwhelmed him in that instant was admiration for the gesture with which she had thrown her clothes aside. With its grace and carelessness it seemed to annihilate a whole culture, a whole system of thought, as though Big Brother and the Party and the Thought Police could all be swept into nothingness by a single splendid movement of the arm. That too was a gesture belonging to the ancient time. Winston woke up with the word "Shakespeare" on his lips.</div>

<div class="line_en">The telescreen was giving forth an ear-splitting whistle which continued on the same note for thirty seconds. It was nought seven fifteen, getting-up time for office workers. Winston wrenched his body out of bed -- naked, for a member of the Outer Party received only three thousand clothing coupons annually, and a suit of pyjamas was six hundred -- and seized a dingy singlet and a pair of shorts that were lying across a chair. The Physical Jerks would begin in three minutes. The next moment he was doubled up by a violent coughing fit which nearly always attacked him soon after waking up. It emptied his lungs so completely that he could only begin breathing again by lying on his back and taking a series of deep gasps. His veins had swelled with the effort of the cough, and the varicose ulcer had started itching.</div>

<div class="line_en">The pain of the coughing fit had not quite driven out of Winston's mind the impression made by his dream, and the rhythmic movements of the exercise restored it somewhat. As he mechanically shot his arms back and forth, wearing on his face the look of grim enjoyment which was considered proper during the Physical Jerks, he was struggling to think his way backward into the dim period of his early childhood. It was extraordinarily difficult. Beyond the late "fifties everything faded. When there were no external records that you could refer to, even the outline of your own life lost its sharpness. You remembered huge events which had quite probably not happened, you remembered the detail of incidents without being able to recapture their atmosphere, and there were long blank periods to which you could assign nothing. Everything had been different then. Even the names of countries, and their shapes on the map, had been different. Airstrip One, for instance, had not been so called in those days: it had been called England or Britain, though London, he felt fairly certain, had always been called London.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="咳嗽引起的疼痛并没有将梦留给温斯顿的印象去除干净，体操有节奏的动作多少又将这印象带了回来。他一边机械地前后晃动手臂，脸上挂着做体操时所必须挂着的高兴笑容，同时，他努力回想起他模糊的童年。这极为困难。五十年代初期之前一切事都淡薄了。那时，没有外部记录可以参照，你甚至无法对你自身的生活作出概述。你记得的大事件也许没有发生过，你记得的那些事变的细节无法复活它们的氛围，有些长长的空白期，你想不起任何事情。那时，一切都是不同的。甚至国家名称，他们在地图上的形态，也不一样。如“跑道一号”，那时并不这么叫，它曾叫做英格兰或不列颠，虽然伦敦——他觉得很有把握——始终叫伦敦。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There were people sitting all over the stone-flagged floor, and other people, packed tightly together, were sitting on metal bunks, one above the other. Winston and his mother and father found themselves a place on the floor, and near them an old man and an old woman were sitting side by side on a bunk. The old man had on a decent dark suit and a black cloth cap pushed back from very white hair: his face was scarlet and his eyes were blue and full of tears. He reeked of gin. It seemed to breathe out of his skin in place of sweat, and one could have fancied that the tears welling from his eyes were pure gin. But though slightly drunk he was also suffering under some grief that was genuine and unbearable. In his childish way Winston grasped that some terrible thing, something that was beyond forgiveness and could never be remedied, had just happened. It also seemed to him that he knew what it was. Someone whom the old man loved, a little granddaughter perhaps, had been killed. Every few minutes the old man kept repeating:</div>

<div class="line_en">Winston could not definitely remember a time when his country had not been at war, but it was evident that there had been a fairly long interval of peace during his childhood, because one of his early memories was of an air raid which appeared to take everyone by surprise. Perhaps it was the time when the atomic bomb had fallen on Colchester. He did not remember the raid itself, but he did remember his father's hand clutching his own as they hurried down, down, down into some place deep in the earth, round and round a spiral staircase which rang under his feet and which finally so wearied his legs that he began whimpering and they had to stop and rest. His mother, in her slow dreamy way, was following a long way behind them. She was carrying his baby sister -- or perhaps it was only a bundle of blankets that she was carrying: he was not certain whether his sister had been born then. Finally they had emerged into a noisy, crowded place which he had realized to be a Tube station.</div>

<div class="line_en">Since about that time, war had been literally continuous, though strictly speaking it had not always been the same war. For several months during his childhood there had been confused street fighting in London itself, some of which he remembered vividly. But to trace out the history of the whole period, to say who was fighting whom at any given moment, would have been utterly impossible, since no written record, and no spoken word, ever made mention of any other alignment than the existing one. At this moment, for example, in 1984 (if it was 1984), Oceania was at war with Eurasia and in alliance with Eastasia. In no public or private utterance was it ever admitted that the three powers had at any time been grouped along different lines. Actually, as Winston well knew, it was only four years since Oceania had been at war with Eastasia and in alliance with Eurasia. But that was merely a piece of furtive knowledge which he happened to possess because his memory was not satisfactorily under control. Officially the change of partners had never happened. Oceania was at war with Eurasia: therefore Oceania had always been at war with Eurasia. The enemy of the moment always represented absolute evil, and it followed that any past or future agreement with him was impossible.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Party said that Oceania had never been in alliance with Eurasia. He, Winston Smith, knew that Oceania had been in alliance with Eurasia as short a time as four years ago. But where did that knowledge exist? Only in his own consciousness, which in any case must soon be annihilated. And if all others accepted the lie which the Party imposed -- if all records told the same tale -- then the lie passed into history and became truth. "Who controls the past," ran the Party slogan, "controls the future: who controls the present controls the past." And yet the past, though of its nature alterable, never had been altered. Whatever was true now was true from everlasting to everlasting. It was quite simple. All that was needed was an unending series of victories over your own memory.

<div class="line_en">Winston sank his arms to his sides and slowly refilled his lungs with air. His mind slid away into the labyrinthine world of doublethink. To know and not to know, to be conscious of complete truthfulness while telling carefully-constructed lies, to hold simultaneously two opinions which cancelled out, knowing them to be contradictory and believing in both of them; to use logic against logic, to repudiate morality while laying claim to it, to believe that democracy was impossible and that the Party was the guardian of democracy; to forget whatever it was necessary to forget, then to draw it back into memory again at the moment when it was needed, and then promptly to forget it again: and above all, to apply the same process to the process itself. That was the ultimate subtlety: consciously to induce unconsciousness, and then, once again, to become unconscious of the act of hypnosis you had just performed.

<div class="line_en">Winston loathed this exercise, which sent shooting pains all the way from his heels to his buttocks and often ended by bringing on another coughing fit. The half-pleasant quality went out of his meditations. The past, he reflected, had not merely been altered, it had been actually destroyed. For how could you establish even the most obvious fact when there existed no record outside your own memory? He tried to remember in what year he had first heard mention of Big Brother. He thought it must have been at some time in the 'sixties, but it was impossible to be certain. In the Party histories, of course, Big Brother figured as the leader and guardian of the Revolution since its very earliest days. His exploits had been gradually pushed backwards in time until already they extended into the fabulous world of the 'forties and the 'thirties, when the capitalists in their strange cylindrical hats still rode through the streets of London in great gleaming motor-cars or horse carriages with glass sides. There was no knowing how much of this legend was true and how much invented. Winston could not even remember at what date the Party itself had come into existence. He did not believe he had ever heard the word Ingsoc before 1960, but it was possible that in its Old-speak form -- "English Socialism", that is to say -- it had been current earlier. Everything melted into mist. Sometimes indeed, you could put your finger on a definite lie. It was not true, for example, as was claimed in the Party history books, that the Party had invented aeroplanes. He remembered aeroplanes since his earliest childhood. But you could prove nothing. There was never any evidence. Just once in his whole life he had held in his hands unmistakable documentary proof of the falsification of a historical fact. And on that occasion --</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="温斯顿讨厌这种体操，这会引起枪击一般的疼痛，从脚跟到腰部，最后就是一阵大咳。刚才沉思冥想中得到的一点乐趣化为乌有。他想，过去不仅仅被改变，它实际上被毁灭了。因为你如何可能重建最显而易见的事实，除了你自己的记忆，没有任何的记载？他极力回想是哪一年，他第一次听人提起老大哥。他想这多半是在六十年代的某个时期，但这难以确定。在党的历史上，老大哥自然被认为是革命的领导人和保卫者，一开始就是如此。他的光辉业绩在时间上渐渐往后延伸，直到难以置信的四十年代和三十年代，那时，戴着奇怪的圆筒帽的资本家仍然坐着铮亮的汽车或有玻璃窗的马车经过伦敦的街道。不知道这一传奇有几分真实几分虚构。温斯顿甚至不记得党是哪一天建立的。他不认为在一九六〇年前听到过“英社”一词，但可能它的旧名称——即“英国社会主义”——流行得更早。一切都云里雾里。有时，你确实能够看穿某个谎言，如党史书上声称党发明了飞机，这不是真的。他记得小时候就有飞机了。但你什么也不能证明。从来就没有任何的证据。他一生中仅有一次，他掌握了篡改历史事实的确凿证据。在那个时候——">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"There, comrades! That's how I want to see you doing it. Watch me again. I'm thirty-nine and I've had four children. Now look." She bent over again. "You see my knees aren't bent. You can all do it if you want to," she added as she straightened herself up. "Anyone under forty-five is perfectly capable of touching his toes. We don't all have the privilege of fighting in the front line, but at least we can all keep fit. Remember our boys on the Malabar front! And the sailors in the Floating Fortresses! Just think what they have to put up with. Now try again. That's better comrade, that's much better," she added encouragingly as Winston, with a violent lunge, succeeded in touching his toes with knees unbent, for the first time in several years.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“就这样，同志们！这就是我想要看你们做的。再看我做一遍。我三十九岁了，我有四个孩子。现在看着。”她又弯下腰来。“你们看我的膝盖一点也不弯。如果你们愿意，你们都能做到，”她站起身来又说道。“任何不到四十五岁的人都能碰到他的脚趾头。我们并不都有上前线战斗的光荣，但至少我们都要保持健康。记住我们在马拉巴尔前线的孩子们！记住水上堡垒的水手们！想一想他们所要承受的。现在再试试吧。好一些了，同志，好多了。”她鼓励着温斯顿，他猛地弯下腰，几年来第一次，膝盖没弯，手成功地碰到了脚趾。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A sudden hot sweat had broken out all over Winston's body. His face remained completely inscrutable. Never show dismay! Never show resentment! A single flicker of the eyes could give you away. He stood watching while the instructress raised her arms above her head and -- one could not say gracefully, but with remarkable neatness and efficiency -- bent over and tucked the first joint of her fingers under her toes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="温斯顿全身顿时大汗淋漓。他的脸保持着难以捉摸的表情。永远不要显露惊慌。永远不要显露怨恨。简单的一个眼神也会将你暴露。他站在那儿看着，女指导双臂举过头顶，随后——姿势说不上优美，但特别干脆利落——弯下来，她的指尖碰到了脚趾。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Smith!" screamed the shrewish voice from the telescreen. "6079 Smith W! Yes, you! Bend lower, please! You can do better than that. You're not trying. Lower, please! That's better, comrade. Now stand at ease, the whole squad, and watch me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“史密斯！”电幕上那个严厉的声音尖叫道。“六〇七九号的史密斯！是的，就是你！请再弯下一些！你能做得更好的。你没有努力。再弯一些！好多了，同志。现在全组休息一下，看我的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
