<div class="line_en">Yes, and in that month when Prosperpine comes back, and Ceres' dead heart rekindles, when all the woods are a tender smoky blur, and birds no bigger than a budding leaf dart through the singing trees, and when odorous tar comes spongy in the streets, and boys roll balls of it upon their tongues, and they are lumpy with tops and agated marbles; and there is blasting thunder in the night, and the soaking millionfooted rain, and one looks out at morning on a stormy sky, a broken wrack of cloud; and when the mountain boy brings water to his kinsmen laying fence, and as the wind snakes through the grasses hears far in the valley below the long wail of the whistle, and the faint clangor of a bell; and the blue great cup of the hills seems closer, nearer, for he had heard an inarticulate promise: he has been pierced by Spring, that sharp knife.</div>

Eugene, Max, and Harry ruled their little neighborhood: they made war upon the negroes and the Jews, who amused them, and upon the Pigtail Alley people, whom they hated and despised. Catlike they prowled about in the dark promise of night, sitting at times upon a wall in the exciting glare of the corner lamp, which flared gaseously, winking noisily from time to time.</div>

Goose Grease!" which, they were convinced, was the chief staple of Semitic diet; or with the blind acceptance of little boys of some traditional, or mangled, or imaginary catchword of abuse, they would yell after their muttering and tormented victim: "Veeshamadye Veeshamadye!" confident that they had pronounced the most unspeakable, to Jewish ears, of affronts.</div>

Men are kind to a faithful wagging dog, but he must not walk habitually upon two legs.

<div class="line_en">Eugene had no interest in pogroms, but it was a fetich with Max. The chief object of their torture was a little furtive-faced boy, whose name was Isaac Lipinski. They pounced cattishly at him when he appeared, harried him down alleys, over fences, across yards, into barns, stables, and his own house; he moved with amazing speed and stealth, escaping fantastically, teasing them to the pursuit, thumbing his fingers at them, and grinning with wide Kike constant derision.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尤金对折磨犹太人倒没太大的兴趣，但是迈克斯却特别来劲。他们欺侮的主要对象是一个贼头贼脑的小男孩，他的名字叫艾萨克·李宾斯基。这个孩子只要一出现，他们就会沿着街道猛追上去，追得他跳过篱笆墙，穿过人家院子，钻进谷仓，躲进马厩，最后跑到他自己家里为止。这个小子跑起来特别快，动作也非常敏捷。逃跑的时候，他会回过头来挑逗他们，让他们继续追赶。他会伸出拇指嬉皮笑脸地嘲笑他们。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Once, shrieking with laughter, they followed a running fight through the streets between a young Jew and his father-inlaw, in which each was pursued and pummelled, or pursuing and pummelling; and on the day when Louis Greenberg, a pale Jew returned from college, had killed himself by drinking carbolic acid, they stood curiously outside the dingy wailing house, shaken by sudden glee as they saw his father, a bearded orthodox old Jew, clothed in rusty, greasy black, and wearing a scarred derby, approach running up the hill to his home, shaking his hands in the air, and wailing rhythmically:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有一次，正当他们在大街上大声叫着、笑着跟在两个犹太人身后的时候，一个年轻人和他的岳父不知由于什么原因开始打起架来。他们俩一会儿你追我，一会儿我追你，彼此拳打脚踢。还有一次，一位名叫路易·格林伯格的面色苍白的犹太学生从大学回到家以后，服了石炭酸自杀身亡。他们几个伙伴好奇地站在他们家黑暗的房子前面，屋子里的人们沉浸在悲痛之中。但是当他们看见死者的父亲时，都忍不住觉得好笑。他是一位老实巴交的犹太老头，长着大胡子，身上穿着油亮发光的黑衣衫，头戴破旧的圆礼帽。他一路跌跌撞撞地跑上山坡，向家里赶来。他的双手在空中乱舞着，而且还很有节奏地高声喊着：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="有时候，在可怕的夜色里，他们会像猫儿一样在街道上四处游荡。他们几个人聚集在某个犹太人家的窗户下，吃吃地边笑边偷听屋里浑厚、兴奋的高声谈话，偷听犹太女人说话时的嘶哑腔调；有时候他们也能听见犹太人家里高声的吵架声，这种吵架几乎每天晚上都会发生。每次一听到他们都会大笑起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But the whiteheaded children of Pigtail Alley they hated without humor, without any mitigation of a most bitter and alienate hate. Pigtail Alley was a muddy rut which sprawled down hill off the lower end of Woodson Street, ending vaguely in the rank stench of a green-scummed marsh bottom. On one side of this vile road there was a ragged line of whitewashed shacks, inhabited by poor whites, whose children were almost always whitehaired, and who, snuff-mouthed bony women, and tobacco-jawed men, sprawled stupidly in the sun-stench of their rude wide-boarded porches. At night a smoky lamp burned dismally in the dark interiors, there was a smell of frying cookery and of unclean flesh, strident rasping shrews' cries, the drunken maniacal mountain drawl of men: a scream and a curse.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是他们最讨厌猪尾巷的那帮白发小孩，对他们深恶痛绝，毫无嬉笑的意味。猪尾巷是沿着山坡直达伍德森大街尽头的一条泥泞路。这条巷子的尽头是一片臭气熏天、漂着绿色浮沫的沼泽地。这条肮脏土路的另一侧是一排破破烂烂、样子难看的房子，墙壁都用白灰粉刷过，里面住的大都是穷困的白人。这里的孩子差不多都长着白头发。女人们个个瘦得皮包骨头，吸着鼻烟；男人们全都嚼着烟叶，百无聊赖地在粗木板门廊前晒着太阳。一到晚上，黑暗的屋子里燃起昏暗的油灯，油烟四散，空气里弥漫着一股油炸食品的味道，还有不干净之人身上散出的味道。其间还夹杂着悍妇们尖刻的叫骂声，山野醉汉拖长的高声吼叫声。一声叫喊，一声咒骂。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The child came up the gummed trunk like a cat: Eugene rocked from the slender spiral topmost bough, exulting in his lightness, the tree's resilient strength, and the great morning-clarion fragrant backyard world. The Alley picked his bucket with miraculous speed, skinned spryly to the ground and emptied it into the heaping pan, and was halfway up the trunk again when his gaunt mother streaked up the yard toward him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是，那个孩子像猫儿一样灵巧地爬上了满是树胶的树干。尤金的位置处于摇摇晃晃大树的最顶端，正为自己敏捷的身手、树枝良好的弹性、清晨芬芳的园林而扬扬得意。那个“猪尾巷来的孩子”手脚非常麻利，一眨眼工夫就摘满了一大筐樱桃。然后他滑下树把果子倒进大簸箕里。他刚要转身向树上回爬的时候，他憔悴瘦弱的母亲却冲进了院子，径直朝他走过去。">查看中文翻译</div>

He was three or four years older than Eugene, an awkward, heavy, muscular boy, smelling always of his father's paints and oils, coarse-featured, meaty sloping jaw and a thick catarrhal look about his nose and mouth. He was the breaker of visions; the proposer of iniquities. In the cool thick evening grass of Gant's yard one sunset, he smashed forever, as they lay there talking, the enchantment of Christmas; but he brought in its stead the smell of paint, the gaseous ripstink, the unadorned, sweating, and imageless passion of the vulgar.

<div class="line_en">More often, as Spring deepened, he went now to Gant's shop on the Square. He loved the scene: the bright hill-cooled sun, the blown sheets of spray from the fountain, the garrulous firemen emerging from the winter, the lazy sprawling draymen on his father's wooden steps, snaking their whips deftly across the pavement, wrestling in heavy horseplay, Jannadeau in his dirty fly-specked window prying with delicate monocled intentness into the entrails of a watch, the reeking mossiness of Gant's fantastical brick shack, the great interior dustiness of the main room in front, sagging with gravestones -- small polished slabs from Georgia, blunt ugly masses of Vermont granite, modest monuments with an urn, a cherub figure, or a couchant lamb, ponderous fly-specked angels from Carrara in Italy which he bought at great cost, and never sold -- they were the joy of his heart.</div>

The sloping market Square, pocketed obliquely off the public Square, and filled with the wagons of draymen and county peddlers, and on the lower side on a few Poor White houses and on the warehouse and office of Will Pentland.</div>

<div class="line_en">Eugene would find his father, leaning perilously on Jannadeau's dirty glass showcase, or on the creaking little fence that marked him off, talking politics, war, death, and famine, denouncing the Democrats, with references to the bad weather, taxation, and soup-kitchens that attended their administration, and eulogizing all the acts, utterances, and policies of Theodore Roosevelt. Jannadeau, guttural, judiciously reasonable, statistically argumentative, would consult, in all disputed areas, his library -- a greasy edition of the World Almanac, three years old, saying, triumphantly, after a moment of dirty thumbing: "Ah -- just as I thought: the muni-CIP-al taxation of Milwaukee under De-MO-cratic administration in 1905 was $2.25 the hundred, the lowest it had been in years. I cannot ima-GINE why the total revenue is not given."

He never wore work-clothes; he worked dressed in well brushed garments of heavy black, his coat removed, and a long striped apron covering all his front.

His desires were not modest -- no fortune under $250,000 satisfied him: the income of $100,000 at six per cent would pinch one, he felt, from lavishness; and if the reward of virtue was only twenty thousand dollars, he felt bitter chagrin, reckoning life insecure, and comfort a present warmth.</div>

<div class="line_en">Before they came to the house, crossing a field, it would be necessary to go over a stile; he would go over first, helping her down, looking ardently at the graceful curve of her long, deliberately exposed, silk-clad leg.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们穿过田野，还必须跨过一堵矮墙才能回到家里。他总会率先跳过去，然后回过身来帮助她。他的眼睛会炽热地盯着她曲线优美、修长、故意露出来的大腿，大腿上穿着丝袜。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As the days shortened, they would come by dark, or under the heavy low-hanging autumnal moon. She would pretend to be frightened as they passed the woods, press in to him and take his arm at imaginary sounds, until one night, crossing the stile, boldly resolved upon an issue, she would pretend difficulty in descending, and he would lift her down in his arms.

<div class="line_cn" title="日子渐渐变短，他们经常直到天黑才回来，有时候回来的时候甚至已是明月当空的深夜了。他们穿过小树林的时候，她会装出非常害怕的样子，紧紧地靠在他身边，一有什么响动，她就会马上抓紧他的胳膊。直到有一天晚上，正当他们要翻墙的时候，她做出了一个大胆的决定：她故意装着下不了墙的样子，使他不得不伸出两只手把她搀扶了下来。她在他的耳边轻声地说：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"How strong you are, Eugene." Still holding her, his hand would shift under her knees.

<div class="line_cn" title="“你的身体真棒，尤金。”尤金仍然抱着她，一只手就从她的膝部向上摸去。当他把她放到冻得硬邦邦的地面上时，她会动情地把他拉进自己怀里，一下又一下，抚摸着他，就在那寒露结霜的柿子树下，满足了自己的渴望，同时也煽起了他童稚的欲火。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"By God, W. O., you'll have to make a lawyer out of him. That's what he's cut out for." Major Liddell spat accurately, out of his high cracked voice, across the pavement, and settled back in his chair below the library windows, smoothing his stained white pointed beard with a palsied hand. He was a veteran.</div>
