<div class="line_en">A huge firepit had been dug in the center of the earthen floor, and its flames rose swirling and crackling toward the smoke-stained ceiling. The walls were equal parts stone and soil, with huge white roots twisting through them like a thousand slow pale snakes. People were emerging from between those roots as she watched; edging out from the shadows for a look at the captives, stepping from the mouths of pitch-black tunnels, popping out of crannies and crevices on all sides. in one place on the far side of the fire, the roots formed a kind of stairway up to a hollow in the earth where a man sat almost lost in the tangle of weirwood.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Huntsman had turned out to be a stocky man in patched tan leathers, balding and weak-chinned and quarrelsome. At Stoney Sept she had thought that Lem and Greenbeard might be tom to pieces when they faced him at the crow cages to claim his captive for the lightning lord. The hounds had been all around them, sniffing and snarling. But Tom o' Sevens soothed them with his playing, Tansy marched across the square with her apron full of bones and fatty mutton, and Lem pointed out Anguy in the brothel window, standing with an arrow notched. The Mad Huntsman had cursed them all for lickspittles, but finally he had agreed to take his prize to Lord Beric for judgment.</div>

<div class="line_en">Big as the fire was, the cave was bigger; it was hard to tell where it began and where it ended. The tunnel mouths might have been two feet deep or gone on two miles. Arya saw men and women and little children, all of them watching her warily.</div>

<div class="line_en">Greenbeard said, "Here's the wizard, skinny squirrel. You'll get your answers now." He pointed toward the fire, where Tom Sevenstrings stood talking to a tall thin man with oddments of old armor buckled on over his ratty pink robes. That can't be Thoros of Myr. Arya remembered the red priest as fat, with a smooth face and a shiny bald head. This man had a droopy face and a full head of shaggy grey hair. Something Tom said made him look at her, and Arya thought he was about to come over to her. Only then the Mad Huntsman appeared, shoving his captive down into the light, and she and Gendry were forgotten.</div>

<div class="line_en">"When we left King's Landing we were men of Winterfell and men of Darry and men of Blackhaven, Mallery men and Wylde men. We were knights and squires and men-at-arms, lords and commoners, bound together only by our purpose." The voice came from the man seated amongst the weirwood roots halfway up the wall. "Six score of us set out to bring the king's justice to your brother." The speaker was descending the tangle of steps toward the floor. "Six score brave men and true, led by a fool in a starry cloak." A scarecrow of a man, he wore a ragged black cloak speckled with stars and an iron breastplate dinted by a hundred battles. A thicket of red-gold hair hid most of his face, save for a bald spot above his left ear where his head had been smashed in. "More than eighty of our company are dead now, but others have taken up the swords that fell from their hands." When he reached the floor, the outlaws moved aside to let him pass. One of his eyes was gone, Arya saw, the flesh about the socket scarred and puckered, and he had a dark black ring all around his neck. "With their help, we fight on as best we can, for Robert and the realm."</div>

<div class="line_en">Arya could see the whites of Sandor Clegane's eyes as he bulled his way forward again. Three steps up and two back, a move to the left that Lord Beric blocked, two more forward and one back, clang and clang, and the big oaken shields took blow after blow after blow. The Hound's lank dark hair was plastered to his brow in a sheen of sweat. Wine sweat, Arya thought, remembering that he'd been taken drunk. She thought she could see the beginnings of fear wake in his eyes. He's going to lose, she told herself, exulting, as Lord Beric's flaming sword whirled and slashed. in one wild flurry, the lightning lord took back all the ground the Hound had gained, sending Clegane staggering to the very edge of the firepit once more. He is, he is, he's going to die. She stood on her toes for a better look.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="桑铎·克里冈再次奋力向前，艾莉亚可以看见他眼中的疯狂。他进三步，退两步，然后左跨一步，却被贝里伯爵识破。他再进两步，退一步…铁剑铛，铛，两面橡木巨盾承受着一次又一次的猛击。猎狗的长直黑发紧贴额头，闪着汗光。汗里有酒，艾莉亚心想，他是喝醉之后被捕的。她觉察到他眼底逐渐升起的恐惧。随着贝里伯爵的火焰剑回旋劈砍，她欣喜地告诉自己：猎狗快输了。又一轮猛烈进攻，闪电大王将猎狗逼回原来的位置，迫使克里冈踉踉跄跄地撞到火坑边。是的，是的，他快死了！她踮起脚尖，以便看得更真切。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Bloody bastard!" the Hound screamed as he felt the fire licking against the back of his thighs. He charged, swinging the heavy sword harder and harder, trying to smash the smaller man down with brute force, to break blade or shield or arm. But the flames of Dondarrion's parries snapped at his eyes, and when the Hound jerked away from them, his foot went out from under him and he staggered to one knee. At once Lord Beric closed, his downcut screaming through the air trailing permons of fire. Panting from exertion, Clegane jerked his shield up over his head just in time, and the cave rang with the loud crack of splintering oak.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“操你妈的混蛋！”猎狗嘶喊。火苗舔到大腿后侧，他拼命向前冲锋，将沉甸甸的剑舞得愈来愈猛，试图以蛮力击倒较矮小的对手，打断对方的剑、盾或手臂。但唐德利恩格挡时产生的火焰卷向他眼睛，迫使他又慌忙后退，发力间腿一软，单膝跪倒在地。贝里伯爵立即扑上前，火焰剑呼啸着劈砍，在空中划出一道火轮。克里冈气喘吁吁地将盾牌举过头顶，山洞里回荡着橡木碎裂的巨大声响。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sandor Clegane had fought his way back to his feet with a reckless counterattack. Not until Lord Beric retreated a pace did the Hound seem to realize that the fire that roared so near his face was his own shield, burning. With a shout of revulsion, he hacked down savagely on the broken oak, completing its destruction. The shield shattered, one piece of it spinning away, still afire, while the other clung stubbornly to his forearm. His efforts to free himself only fanned the flames. His sleeve caught, and now his whole left arm was ablaze. "Finish him!" Greenbeard urged Lord Beric, and other voices took up the chant of "Guilty!" Arya shouted with the rest. "Guilty, guilty, kill him, guilty!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="桑铎·克里冈奋力起身，发动孤注一掷的反击。但贝里伯爵还没还手，猎狗就意识到火焰原来是在自己盾牌上燃烧翻滚，如此靠近自己的脸。他憎恶地大喝一声，疯狂地敲向已然碎裂的橡木盾牌，将其彻底毁坏。盾牌分裂，其中一块烧着飞旋出去，另一块仍顽固地附在他前臂上。他奋力挣扎，反而助长火势，袖子着了火，整条左臂都燃起来。“杀了他！”绿胡子催促贝里伯爵，其他人则喝诵，“有罪！”艾莉亚跟着他们高呼，“有罪，有罪，杀了他，他有罪！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Smooth as summer silk, Lord Beric slid close to make an end of the man before him. The Hound gave a rasping scream, raised his sword in both hands and brought it crashing down with all his strength. Lord Beric blocked the cut easily…</div>

<div class="line_en">… but the burning sword snapped in two, and the Hound's cold steel plowed into Lord Beric's flesh where his shoulder joined his neck and clove him clean down to the breastbone. The blood came rushing out in a hot black gush.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="…但燃烧的兵器不堪重负，断成两截，猎狗那柄冰冷的铁剑顺势埋入贝里伯爵的血肉之中，正砍在肩膀和脖子的交界处，直劈到胸骨。暗红的热血一下子涌出来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sandor Clegane jerked backward, still burning. He ripped the remnants of his shield off and flung them away with a curse, then rolled in the dirt to smother the fire running along his arm.</div>

<div class="line_en">Lord Beric's knees folded slowly, as if for prayer. When his mouth opened only blood came out. The Hound's sword was still in him as he toppled face forward. The dirt drank his blood. Beneath the hollow hill there was no sound but the soft crackling of flames and the whimper the Hound made when he tried to rise. Arya could only think of Mycah and all the stupid prayers she'd prayed for the Hound to die. If there were gods, why didn't Lord Beric win? She knew the Hound was guilty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="贝里伯爵双膝缓缓跪下，仿佛是做祈祷。他张开嘴，却只有鲜血涌出。当他迎面扑倒在地时，猎狗的剑仍卡在身上。泥土吸收了血液。空山里毫无声息，唯有火焰轻轻的噼啪以及试图起立的猎狗发出的呜咽。艾莉亚想到米凯和自己蠢笨的祷词，她日夜祈祷猎狗的死。如果世间真有神灵存在，为何贝里伯爵不能获胜？她知道，猎狗是有罪的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Tom Sevenstrings and some woman were helping the Hound to his feet. The sight of his arm shocked her speechless. There was a strip of pink where the leather strap had clung, but above and below the flesh was cracked and red and bleeding from elbow to wrist. When his eyes met hers, his mouth twitched. "You want me dead that bad? Then do it, wolf girl. Shove it in. It's cleaner than fire." Clegane tried to stand, but as he moved a piece of burned flesh sloughed right off his arm, and his knees went out from under him. Tom caught him by his good arm and held him up.</div>
