<div class="line_en">The fifth time Wang Miao logged on to Three Body, it was dawn as usual, but the world was unrecognizable. The great pyramid that had appeared the first four times had been destroyed by the tri-solar syzygy. In its place was a tall, modern building, whose dark gray shape was familiar to Wang: the United Nations Headquarters.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="汪淼第五次进入《三体》时，黎明中的世界已面目全非。前四次均出现的大金字塔已在“三日连珠”中毁灭，在那个位置上出现了一座高大的现代建筑。这幢黑色大楼的样子汪淼很熟悉，那是联合国大厦。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Wang heard a violin playing something by Mozart. The playing wasn't very practiced, but there was a special charm to it, as though saying: I play for myself. The violinist was a homeless old man sitting on the steps in front of the UN Headquarters, his fluffy silver hair fluttering in the wind. Next to his feet was an old top hat containing some scattered change.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="汪淼听见一阵小提琴声，好像是莫扎特的一首曲子，拉得不熟练，但有一种很特别的韵味，仿佛时时在说明，这是拉给自己听的，而自己也很欣赏。琴声来自坐在大厦正门台阶上的一位流浪老人，他蓬松的银发在风中飘着，他脚下放了一顶破礼帽，里面好像已经有人放了些零钱。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The sun was very large, its half-risen disk taking up a third of the horizon. Wang's heart beat faster: Such a large sun could only mean another great catastrophe. But when Wang turned around, the old man continued to play as though nothing odd was happening. His silver hair shone brilliantly in the sun, as though it was on fire.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="太阳很大．升出一半的日轮占据了三分之一的地平线。汪淼的心跳加快了，这么大的太阳，只能意味着又一次大毁灭。但他回头看时，见那位老人仍若无其事地坐在那儿拉琴，他的银发在太阳的光芒中像燃烧起来似的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Wang realized that the disk did not emit light. It only reflected the light from the real sun, which was on the other side of the sky, below the horizon. What had risen wasn't a sun at all, but a giant moon. The giant moon moved briskly up the sky at a pace that could be detected by the naked eye. In the process, it gradually waned from a full to a half moon, and then a crescent. The old man's soothing violin strains drifted on the cold morning breeze. The majestic sight of the universe was like the music made material. Wang was intoxicated.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="汪淼明白了，它本身不发光，只是反射从另一个方向发出晨光的真太阳的光芒，升起来的不是太阳，而是一个巨型月亮！巨月运行得很快，以肉眼可以察觉的速度掠过长空，在这个过程中，它逐渐由满月融缺成半月，然后又变成了月牙，老人舒缓的小提琴声在寒冷的晨风中飘荡，宇宙中壮丽的景象仿佛就是那音乐的物化，汪淼陶醉于美的震慑之中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The sun was silvery, just like the old man's hair. It cast a pale white light over the ground, but Wang couldn't feel any warmth from the light. He gazed at the sun, which had now completely risen. On the giant silver disk he could pick out lines like wood grains: mountain ranges.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这太阳就是银色的，与老人头发一样的颜色，它将一片银光撒向大地，但汪淼从这光芒中感觉不到一点儿暖意。他看看已经完全升出地平线的太阳，从那发出银光的巨盘上，他清晰地看到了木纹状的图形，那是固态的山脉。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I've always believed that without me, others would have discovered special relativity eventually. But general relativity is different. The bit that Newton lacked was the effect on planetary orbit from the gravitationally induced curvature of space-time described by general relativity. Though the error caused by it was small, its impact on the results of the computation was fatal. Adding the correction factor for perturbation from space-time curvature to the classical equations would yield the right mathematical model. The amount of computational power required far exceeds what you accomplished in the East, but is easily provided by modern computers."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我一直认为，没有我，别人也会发现狭义相对论，但广义相对论却不是这样。牛顿差的那一点，就是广义相对论所描述的行星轨道的引力摄动，它引起的误差虽然但对计算结果却是致命的。在经典方程中加入引力摄动的修正，就得到了正确的数学模型。它的运算量比你们在东方完成的要大得多，但对现代计算机来说，真的不成问题。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Thank you, Mr. Copernicus. Let's hope that God doesn't abandon you, though I don't have much faith in that.

The weight was also made of metal, streamlined, with a smooth, mirrorlike, electroplated surface. The pendulum line, made of some ultrastrong material, was so thin as to be almost invisible, and the weight seemed to float in the air between the two towers.</div>

<div class="line_en">Wang's heart clenched as he heard the last phrase. A frozen flying star was a terrible omen for Trisolaris. When a flying star, or a distant sun, seems to come to a complete stop against the background starfield, then the sun's and the planet's motion vectors are aligned. This has three possible interpretations: the sun and the planet are moving in the same direction at the same speed; the sun and the planet are moving apart from each other; and the sun and the planet are moving toward each other. Before Civilization 191, this last possibility was purely theoretical, a disaster that had never occurred. But the population's fear of it and their vigilance did not diminish, so much so that "frozen flying star" became an extremely unlucky phrase in many Trisolaran civilizations. A single flying star remaining still was sufficient to terrify everyone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="听到最后四个字，汪淼心里一紧。“飞星不动”是三体世界最大的凶兆，飞星，或者说远方的太阳，从地面的观察角度看在宇宙的背景上静止了，只意味太阳与行星在一条直线上运行。这有三种可观能：一、太阳与行星以相同的速度向同一方向运行；二、太阳正远离行星而去，三、太阳正冲向行星而来。在191号文明之前，这只是一种想象中的灾难，从未真实发生过，但人们对它的恐惧和警觉丝毫没有放松，以至于“飞星不动”成了多个三体文明中的一句最不吉利的咒语。即使只有一颗飞星静止，也让人不寒而栗。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"And then three flying stars froze simultaneously. The people of Civilization 191 stood on the ground, gazing up helplessly at the three frozen flying stars, at the three suns falling directly toward their world. A few days later, one of the suns moved to a distance where its outer gaseous layer became visible. In the middle of a tranquil night, the star suddenly turned into a blazing sun. Separated by intervals of thirty hours or so, the other two suns also appeared in quick succession. This was not a normal kind of tri-solar day. By the time the last flying star turned into a sun, the first sun had already swept past the planet at extremely close range. Right after that, the other two suns swept past Trisolaris at even closer ranges, well within the planet's Roche limit31, such that the tidal forces imposed on Trisolaris by the three suns exceeded the force of the planet's gravitational self-attraction. The first sun shook the deepest geological structure of the planet; the second sun tore open a great rift in the planet that went straight to the core; and the third sun ripped the planet into two pieces."</div>

Then the lava cooled and turned into rings around the planets, but because of perturbations from the planets, the rings were unstable. The rocks that formed them fell back to the surface in a rain of giant stones that lasted several centuries… Can you imagine what kind of hell that was? The ecological destruction caused by this catastrophe was the most severe in all of history. All life on the companion planet went extinct, and the mother planet almost became a lifeless waste as well. But in the end, the seeds of life managed to germinate here, and as the geology of the mother planet settled down, evolution began its tottering steps in new oceans and on new continents, until civilization reappeared for the one hundred and ninety-second time.

The dense, searing planetary core material gushed to the surface, and the oceans boiled over the lava. The continents drifted over the magma like icebergs.

When the gaseous layer expands, its thickness can grow by more than a dozen times. This greatly increases the diameter of the sun, like a giant mitt that can catch planets more easily. When a planet passes by a sun at close range, it will enter the sun's gaseous layer. Friction will cause it to lose speed, and finally, like a meteor, it will fall into the blazing sea of the sun, dragging a long, fiery tail."</div>

Unlike a pendulum in the real world, this giant pendulum's period was not stable, but changed constantly. This was due to the continually shifting gravitational attraction of the giant moon. When the giant moon was on this side of the planet, its gravity partially canceled out the gravity of the planet, causing the pendulum to lose weight. When it was on the other side of the planet, its gravity was added to the gravity of the planet, causing the pendulum's weight to increase, almost to the level it would have had before the great rip.</div>
