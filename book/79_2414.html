<div class="line_en">He had vague memories: listening to a man who had once been a successful radio comic and then a variety star in TV', infant days telling a very long and very hilarious joke about incest between Siamese twins; seeing the woman in the harem pants and the sequined bra do a slow and sinuous striptease to some bumping-and- grinding music from the jukebox (it seemed it had been David Rose's theme music from The Stripper); crossing the lobby as one of three, the other two men in evening dress that predated the twenties, all of them singing about the stiff patch on Rosie O'Grady's knickers. He seemed to remember looking out the big double doors and seeing Japanese lanterns strung in graceful, curving arcs that followed the sweep of the driveway -- they gleamed in soft pastel colors like dusky jewels. The big glass globe on the porch ceiling was on, and night-insects bumped and flittered against it, and a part of him, perhaps the last tiny spark of sobriety, tried to tell him that it was 6 A. M. on a morning in December. But time had been canceled.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“亲爱的，什么东西这么好笑？”他又来了，在舞厅里。枝形吊灯亮着，他们周围挤满了对对舞伴，有些穿着戏装，有些没有，和着战后乐曲奏出的轻快乐曲——哪一场战争？你能肯定吗？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">No, of course not. He was certain of only one thing: he was dancing with a beautiful woman.</div>

<div class="line_en">She was tall and auburn-haired, dressed in clinging white satin, and she was dancing close to him, her breasts pressed softly and sweetly against his chest. Her white hand was entwined in his. She was wearing a small and sparkly cat's -- eye mask and her hair had been brushed over to one side in a soft and gleaming fall that seemed to pool in the valley between their touching shoulders. Her dress was full-skirted but he could feel her thighs against his legs from time to time and had become more and more sure that she was smoothand-powdered naked under her dress, (the better to feel your erection with, my dear) and he was sporting a regular railspike. If it offended her she concealed it well; she snuggled even closer to him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她高高的个子，茶褐色的头发，穿着贴身的白缎子连衣裙。跳舞时…她的身体紧挨着他，乳房温柔甜蜜地顶在他胸膛上，白皙的手握在他手里。她戴着一副小小的闪光猫眼面具，头发梳在一边，像一道柔和闪亮的瀑布，仿佛要坠入他们紧挨着的肩膀之间的那道峡谷里。她全身都裹在裙子里，但他能感到她的大腿时不时地顶到他的腿上。他越来越相信，那层薄薄的外衣下面必定是她光滑细腻的赤身裸体。（最好是感觉到你勃起来了，亲爱的。）他觉得下面有些不对头。如果这对她有所冒犯的话，那么她把它掩饰过去了。她偎得更近了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jack looked over her bare shoulder and saw Derwent standing by the refreshment table. The girl in the sarong was with him. There were bottles of champagne in ice buckets ranged along the white lawn covering the table, and Derwent held a foaming bottle in his hand. A knot of people had gathered, laughing. In front of Derwent and the girl in the sarong, Roger capered grotesquely on all fours, his tail dragging limply behind him. He was barking.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="罗杰上身直立起来，蹲在屁股上。面具的长嘴固定地大张着，一副狺狺的样子。罗杰的眼睛在面具的眼孔里转动着，兴奋得发狂，汗涔涔的。他伸出手臂，吊着爪子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She wove her way into the eating, drinking throng and he gazed after her stupidly, wondering how they had happened to be dancing together in the first place. He didn't remember. Incidents seemed to have occurred with no connections. First here, then there, then everywhere. His head was spinning. He smelled lilies and juniper berries. Up by the refreshment table Derwent was now holding a tiny triangular sandwich over Roger's head and urging him, to the general merriment of the onlookers, to do a somersault. The dogmask was turned upward. The silver sides of the dog costume bellowed in and out. Roger suddenly leaped, tucking his head under, and tried to roll in mid-air. His leap was too low and too exhausted; he landed awkwardly on his back, rapping his head smartly on the tiles. A hollow groan drifted out of the dogmask.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她在吃吃喝喝的人群中穿行，他的目光傻呆呆地尾随着她，不明白他俩究竟怎么碰巧跳起舞来了。他记不起来了，各种各样的事件毫无联系地相继发生。开始在这儿，接着又到了那儿，然后无处不在。他的脑子打着旋，他闻到了百合花香和桧柏雪利酒的香味。稍远的点心桌边，德文特拿着一小块三角形的三明治吊在罗杰的脑袋上方，要他翻个斤头，逗得围观者直乐。狗面具仰起了头，狗戏装两肋起伏着。突然，罗杰跳了起来，缩着头，想在空中打个滚。他跳得太低了，他太疲劳了。他笨拙地仰面掉在地板上，头狠狠地撞在了地板砖上。狗面具里传出了一声沉闷的呻吟。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Sorry," Jack said thickly. He suddenly felt closed in and claustrophobic; he wanted to get out. He wanted the Overlook back the way it had been… free of these unwanted guests. His place was not honored, as the true opener of the way; he was only another of the ten thousand cheering extras, a doggy rolling over and sitting up on command.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“抱歉，”杰克嗓音沙哑地说。他突然感到被封闭起来了，憋闷得发慌，他想出去。他希望远望饭店恢复到从前的样子…没有这些不速之客。他在这里并没受到尊重，正如那些真正的开路人；他只是醉生梦死的芸芸众生中的一个，一条叫打滚就打滚、叫坐起来就坐起来的狗。">查看中文翻译</div>
