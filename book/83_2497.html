<div class="line_en">It was about eleven o'clock in the morning, mid October, with the sun not shining and a look of hard wet rain in the clearness of the foothills. I was wearing my powder-blue suit, with dark blue shirt, tie and display handkerchief, black brogues, black wool socks with dark blue clocks on them. I was neat, clean, shaved and sober, and I didn't care who knew it. I was everything the well-dressed private detective ought to be. I was calling on four million dollars.</div>

<div class="line_en">The main hallway of the Sternwood place was two stories high. Over the entrance doors, which would have let in a troop of Indian elephants, there was a broad stained-glass panel showing a knight in dark armor rescuing a lady who was tied to a tree and didn't have any clothes on but some very long and convenient hair. The knight had pushed the vizor of his helmet back to be sociable, and he was fiddling with the knots on the ropes that tied the lady to the tree and not getting anywhere. I stood there and thought that if I lived in the house, I would sooner or later have to climb up there and help him. He didn't seem to be really trying.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯特恩伍德府进门的大厅有两层楼高。入口足以容一队印度象通过，上方一大块彩色窗玻璃，画着一个身穿黑色铠甲的骑士正在营救一位小姐，她被绑在树上，一丝不挂，只有一头长发恰好遮羞。骑士不忘礼节，打开了面罩；他拨弄着把那位小姐同树绑定的绳结，却毫无进展。我站在下面，心想若是我住在这房子里，迟早得爬上去帮他一把不可。他好像并没有真的在尽力。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There were French doors at the back of the hall, beyond them a wide sweep of emerald grass to a white garage, in front of which a slim dark young chauffeur in shiny black leggings was dusting a maroon Packard convertible. Beyond the garage were some decorative trees trimmed as carefully as poodle dogs. Beyond them a large greenhouse with a domed roof. Then more trees and beyond everything the solid, uneven, comfortable line of the foothills.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大厅后面是两扇落地玻璃窗，门外一大片翠绿的草地，通往一间白色的车库。屋前，一个绑着油亮裹腿、身材瘦削的年轻黑人司机正在刷洗一辆褐紫色的帕卡德敞篷车。车库那边种了一些树装点环境，都当成贵宾犬似的细细修剪过。更远处是一座巨大的圆顶暖房。往后又是树，极目望去，看得到山麓那连绵起伏的柔顺轮廓。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On the east side of the hall a free staircase, tile-paved, rose to a gallery with a wrought-iron railing and another piece of stained-glass romance. Large hard chairs with rounded red plush seats were backed into the vacant spaces of the wall round about. They didn't look as if anybody had ever sat in them. In the middle of the west wall there was a big empty fireplace with a brass screen in four hinged panels, and over the fireplace a marble mantel with cupids at the corners. Above the mantel there was a large oil portrait, and above the portrait two bullet-torn or moth-eaten cavalry pennants crossed in a glass frame. The portrait was a stiffly posed job of an officer in full regimentals of about the time of the Mexican war. The officer had a neat black imperial, black mustachios, hot hard coal-black eyes, and the general look of a man it would pay to get along with. I thought this might be General Sternwood's grandfather. It could hardly be the General himself, even though I had heard he was pretty far gone in years to have a couple of daughters still in the dangerous twenties.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大厅东边有段独立式样的楼梯，铺着瓷砖；拾级而上，是一条装有精美铁栏杆的长廊，又一块镶着传奇故事的彩色玻璃出现了。靠四周墙面，摆放着铺有红色毛绒圆坐垫的硬背大椅子。看样子，那些座椅从来没人坐过。西墙正中有个空荡荡的大壁炉，炉前的挡板是由四块铜片铰接成的。壁炉上方是座大理石炉台，角上立着丘比特像。炉台向上是一大幅油画，油画再往上是两面骑兵矛旗，破破烂烂，也不知是枪打的还是虫蛀的，交叉挂在玻璃框里。画中人一身大约墨西哥战争时期的戎装，僵硬地摆出军官的标准造型。那军官蓄着一绺匀整的黑色帝髯，两撇黑色髭须，一双炽热而锐利的眼睛黑如煤炭，通常说来，跟这种模样的人打交道总是有好处的。我心想此人可能是斯特恩伍德将军的祖父。不太可能是将军本人，哪怕我听说他早已一把年纪，可两个女儿才二十多岁，正是惹是生非的时候。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I was still staring at the hot black eyes when a door opened far back under the stairs. It wasn't the butler coming back. It was a girl.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我还在盯着那双炽热的黑眼睛，身后远处楼梯下的门开了。不是管家回来了。是个女孩子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She was twenty or so, small and delicately put together, but she looked durable. She wore pale blue slacks and they looked well on her. She walked as if she were floating. Her hair was a fine tawny wave cut much shorter than the current fashion of pageboy tresses curled in at the bottom. Her eyes were slate-gray, and had almost no expression when they looked at me. She came over near me and smiled with her mouth and she had little sharp predatory teeth, as white as fresh orange pith and as shiny as porcelain. They glistened between her thin too taut lips. Her face lacked color and didn't look too healthy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她二十来岁，身材娇小，看上去却很强韧。穿一条浅蓝色便裤，非常适合她。她走起路来像在飘浮。她一头漂亮的褐色鬈发，比时下流行的那种发梢向内烫卷的齐肩发型要短很多。她的眼眸是蓝灰色的，看我的时候几乎毫无表情。她走到我跟前，咧嘴笑笑，露出几颗又小又尖的虎牙，跟橘子皮内衬一样白，跟瓷一样富有光泽。它们在她那两片过于紧绷的薄嘴唇间闪闪发亮。她面无血色，样子不大健康。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Tall, aren't you?" she said.</div>

<div class="line_en">Her eyes rounded. She was puzzled. She was thinking. I could see, even on that short acquaintance, that thinking was always going to be a bother to her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她瞪圆了眼睛。她犯难了。她在动脑筋。连我这个刚认识她的人都看得出来，动脑筋对她而言向来是件麻烦事儿。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"That's a funny name." She bit her lip and turned her head a little and looked at me along her eyes. Then she lowered her lashes until they almost cuddled her cheeks and slowly raised them again, like a theater curtain. I was to get to know that trick. That was supposed to make me roll over on my back with all four paws in the air.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这名字真滑稽，”她咬咬嘴唇，头别过去了一点，用余光打量着我。她眼帘低垂，等睫毛快要触到面颊才又缓缓抬起，犹如剧场的幕布。我有点知道她玩的什么把戏了。是要让我四脚朝天，仰面在地上打滚。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"A -- a --" She tossed her head angrily, and the rich color of it glistened in the rather dim light of the big hall. "You're making fun of me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“私——私——”她气愤地摇摇头，在那条宽敞走廊的昏暗灯光下，她的头发泛着艳丽的色泽。“你在拿我开心。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“走吧，”我说，“你听到我说什么了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You didn't say anything. You're just a big tease." She put a thumb up and bit it. It was a curiously shaped thumb, thin and narrow like an extra finger, with no curve in the first joint. She bit it and sucked it slowly, turning it around in her mouth like a baby with a comforter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你什么也没说。你就是特喜欢捉弄人。”她竖起一根大拇指，咬了咬。那根大拇指奇形怪状的，又细又小，像多长出来的，缺了一个关节。她咬住手指，慢慢吮了起来，像婴儿吸奶嘴一样，把它在嘴里转动着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You're awfully tall," she said. Then she giggled with secret merriment. Then she turned her body slowly and lithely, without lifting her feet. Her hands dropped limp at her sides. She tilted herself towards me on her toes. She fell straight back into my arms. I had to catch her or let her crack her head on the tessellated floor. I caught her under her arms and she went rubber-legged on me instantly. I had to hold her close to hold her up. When her head was against my chest she screwed it around and giggled at me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你可真高啊。”说完，她心中窃喜，咯咯笑着。接着，她脚也不抬，缓慢而灵巧地转过身去。她两手一垮，垂到身侧。她踮起脚尖，朝我仰靠过来。她直愣愣倒进了我的怀里。要么扶住她，要么由她在大理石地面上摔个头破血流。我抓住她的腋下，她腿一软，立马瘫倒在我身上。我只好抓紧她，托她起来。她头一贴上我的胸膛，就打着圈蹭了起来，还冲我傻笑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="我不做声。正在这个时候，管家刚巧不巧穿过落地窗回来了，看到我抱着她。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It didn't seem to bother him. He was a tall, thin, silver man, sixty or close to it or a little past it. He had blue eyes as remote as eyes could be. His skin was smooth and bright and he moved like a man with very sound muscles. He walked slowly across the floor towards us and the girl jerked away from me. She flashed across the room to the foot of the stairs and went up them like a deer. She was gone before I could draw a long breath and let it out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他对此好像无动于衷。他高大瘦削，满头银发，六十岁上下。一双蓝眼睛冷漠得无以复加。他的皮肤光滑亮洁，看动作，应该是个身强体壮的人。他缓步穿过大厅向我们走来，那女孩急忙从我怀里跳了开去。她飞奔到房间那头的楼梯脚下，像只小鹿般上去了。我还没来得及深吸一口气再呼出来，她就消失了。">查看中文翻译</div>
