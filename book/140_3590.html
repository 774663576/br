<div class="line_en">But the Prince Prospero was happy and dauntless, and sagacious. When his dominions were half depopulated, he summoned to his presence a thousand hale and light-hearted friends from among the knights and dames of his court, and with these retired to the deep seclusion of one of his castellated abbeys. This was an extensive and magnificent structure, the creation of the prince's own eccentric yet august taste. A strong and lofty wall girdled it in. This wall had gates of iron. The courtiers, having entered, brought furnaces and massy hammers and welded the bolts. They resolved to leave means neither of ingress or egress to the sudden impulses of despair from without or of frenzy from within. The abbey was amply provisioned. With such precautions the courtiers might bid defiance to contagion. The external world could take care of itself. In the meantime it was folly to grieve, or to think. The prince had provided all the appliances of pleasure. There were buffoons, there were improvisatori, there were ballêt-dancers, there were musicians, there were cards, there was Beauty, there was wine. All these and security were within. Without was the "Red Death."</div>

<div class="line_en">THE "Red Death" had long devastated the country. No pestilence had been ever so fatal, or so hideous. Blood was its Avator (Avatar) and its seal -- the redness and the horror of blood. There were sharp pains, and sudden dizziness, and then profuse bleedings at the pores, with dissolution. The scarlet stains upon the body and especially upon the face of the victim, were the pest-ban which shut him out from the aid and from the sympathy of his fellow-men. And the whole seizure, progress and termination of the disease were the incidents of half an hour.</div>

<div class="line_en">But first let me tell of the rooms in which it was held. There were seven -- an imperial suite. In many palaces, however, such suites form a long and straight vista, while the folding doors slide back nearly to the walls on either hand, so that the view of the whole extent is scarcely impeded. Here the case was very different; as might have been expected from the duke's love of the bizarre. The apartments were so irregularly disposed that the vision embraced but little more than one at a time. There was a sharp turn at every twenty or thirty yards, and at each turn a novel effect. To the right and left, in the middle of each wall, a tall and narrow Gothic window looked out upon a closed corridor which pursued the windings of the suite. These windows were of stained glass whose color varied in accordance with the prevailing hue of the decorations of the chamber into which it opened. That at the eastern extremity was hung, for example, in blue -- and vividly blue were its windows. The second chamber was purple in its ornaments and tapestries, and here the panes were purple. The third was green throughout, and so were the casements. The fourth was furnished and litten (lighted) with orange -- the fifth with white -- the sixth with violet. The seventh apartment was closely shrouded in black velvet tapestries that hung all over the ceiling and down the walls, falling in heavy folds upon a carpet of the same material and hue. But, in this chamber only, the color of the windows failed to correspond with the decorations. The panes here were scarlet -- a deep blood color. Now in no one of the seven apartments was there any lamp or candelabrum, amid the profusion of golden ornaments that lay scattered to and fro or depended from the roof. There was no light of any kind emanating from lamp or candle within the suite of chambers. But in the corridors that followed the suite, there stood, opposite to each window, a heavy tripod, bearing a brazier of fire that projected its rays through the tinted glass and so glaringly illumined the room. And thus were produced a multitude of gaudy and fantastic appearances. But in the western or black chamber the effect of the fire-light that streamed upon the dark hangings through the blood-tinted panes, was ghastly in the extreme, and produced so wild a look upon the countenances of those who entered, that there were few of the company bold enough to set foot within its precincts at all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这场化装舞会啊，真个是穷奢极侈。这里且容我把举行舞会的场地介绍一下。一共有七间屋子，原是一套行宫。不过若在一般宫中，这种套间只要把折门向两边推开，推齐墙跟，眼前望出去就一片笔直，整个套间一览无遗。而这里的情况大不相同，因为这位王爷就爱别出心裁，其余可想而知了。这些屋子造得极不整齐，一下子只能看到一个地方。每隔二三十步路的地方就有一个急转角，每个转角都可以看到新奇的景物。左右两面墙中间都开着又高又窄的哥特式窗子，窗外是一条围绕这套行宫的回廊。窗子都是彩色玻璃的，色彩各各不同，和打开的各间室内装饰主要色调一致。譬如说，东厢那间悬挂的装饰是蓝色的——窗子就蓝得晶莹。策二间屋子的装饰和帷幔都是紫红的，窗玻璃也照样是紫红的。第三间屋里一律是绿的，窗扉也是绿的。第四间的家具和映入的光线都是橙黄的。第五间全是白的，第六间全是紫罗兰色的。第七间从天花板到四壁壁脚都密密层层罩着黑丝绒帷幔，重重叠叠的拖到同色同科的地毯上。只有这一间的窗子，色彩同室内装饰不一致。这里的窗玻璃是猩红色的——红得象浓浓的血一般。在这七间屋子里，摆得满坑满谷，或悬空挂着的大批金碧辉煌的装饰品中，竟没有一盏灯，也没有一架烛台。在这一套屋子里，根本没有一点灯火，也没有一点烛光。可是在围绕这套屋子的回廊上，每扇窗子对面都搁着一只沉甸甸的大香炉，香炉里有个火钵，发出的光透过彩色玻璃，照得屋里通亮。因此呈现出五光十色，千奇百怪的景象。可是在西厢的黑屋里，火光透过血红的窗玻璃，照射到漆黑的帷慢上，却是无比阴森，凡是进屋的人，无不映得脸无人色，所以男男女女没有一个胆敢走进屋来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was in this apartment, also, that there stood against the western wall, a gigantic clock of ebony. Its pendulum swung to and fro with a dull, heavy, monotonous clang; and when its minute-hand made the circuit of the face, and the hour was to be stricken, there came forth from the brazen lungs of the clock a sound which was clear and loud and deep and exceedingly musical, but of so peculiar a note and emphasis that, at each lapse of an hour, the musicians in the orchestra were constrained to pause, momently, in their performance, to harken to the sound; and thus the waltzers perforce ceased their evolutions; and there was a brief disconcert of the whole gay company; and, while the chimes of the clock yet rang, it was observed that the giddiest grew pale, and that the more aged and sedate passed their hands over their brows as if in confused reverie or meditation. But when the echoes had fully ceased, a light laughter at once pervaded the assembly; the musicians looked at each other and smiled as if at their own nervousness and folly, and made whispering vows, each to the other, that the next chiming of the clock should produce in them no similar emotion; and then, after the lapse of sixty minutes, (which embrace three thousand and six hundred seconds of the Time that flies,) there came yet another chiming of the clock, and then were the same disconcert and tremulousness and meditation as before.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在这间屋里，西墙前摆着一台巨大的乌木檀时钟。钟摆左右摇动，发出的声音又沉闷又呆滞又单调。每当长针在钟面走满一圈，临到报时之际，大钟的黄铜腔里就发出一下深沉的声音，既清澈又洪亮，非常悦耳，然而调子和点子又如此古怪，因此每过一小时，乐队里的乐师都不由得暂停演奏来倾听钟声；双双对对跳着华尔兹舞的也不得不停止旋转，正在寻欢作乐的红男绿女不免乱一阵子；这且不说，钟声还在一下下敲的时候，连放荡透顶的人都变得脸如死灰，上了年纪的和老成持重的都不由双手抚额，仿佛胡思乱想得出了神。但等钟声余音寂止，舞会上才顿时一片轻松的欢笑声；乐师个个面面相觑，哑然失笑，似乎借此为刚才那番神经过敏的愚蠢举止解嘲。大家还私相悄悄发誓，保证下回钟响再也不这样感情用事。不想时间过得飞快，转眼间就过了六十分钟，也就是说过了三千六百秒钟，时钟又敲响了，这时又照旧出现一片混乱和震惊，引起大家沉思。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But, in spite of these things, it was a gay and magnificent revel. The tastes of the duke were peculiar. He had a fine eye for colors and effects. He disregarded the decora of mere fashion. His plans were bold and fiery, and his conceptions glowed with barbaric lustre. There are some who would have thought him mad. His followers felt that he was not. It was necessary to hear and see and touch him to be sure that he was not.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，尽管如此，这场欢宴还是规模盛大，让大家玩得痛痛快快。王爷的口味毕竟古怪。他对色彩和效果别具慧眼。他对时兴的装饰一概不放在眼里。他的设想大胆热烈，他的概念闪耀着粗野的光彩。有人以为他疯了，他的门客却不以为然。不过要确定他没有疯，少不得要听到他说话，见到他的面，跟他接触过才行。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He had directed, in great part, the moveable embellishments of the seven chambers, upon occasion of this great fête, and it was his own guiding taste which had given character to the costumes of the masqueraders. Be sure they were grotesque. There were much glare and glitter and piquancy and phantasm -- much of what has been since seen in "Hernani." There were arabesque figures with unsuited limbs and appointments. There were delirious fancies such as the madman fashions. There was much of the beautiful, much of the wanton, much of the bizarre, something of the terrible, and not a little of that which might have excited disgust. To and fro in the seven chambers there stalked, in fact, a multitude of dreams. And these, the dreams -- writhed in and about, taking hue from the rooms, and causing the wild music of the orchestra to seem as the echo of their steps. And, anon, there strikes the ebony clock which stands in the hall of the velvet. And then, momently, all is still, and all is silent save the voice of the clock. The dreams are stiff-frozen as they stand. But the echoes of the chime die away -- they have endured but an instant -- and a light, half-subdued laughter floats after them as they depart. And now again the music swells, and the dreams live, and writhe to and fro more merrily than ever, taking hue from the many-tinted windows through which stream the rays from the tripods. But to the chamber which lies most westwardly of the seven there are now none of the maskers who venture; for the night is waning away; and there flows a ruddier light through the blood-colored panes; and the blackness of the sable drapery appals; and to him whose foot falls upon the sable carpet, there comes from the near clock of ebony a muffled peal more solemnly emphatic than any which reaches their ears who indulge in the more remote gaieties of the other apartments.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在举行这个盛大宴会之际，七间屋子里那些活动装饰大多是他亲手指点安排的。化装舞会的声光特色也是根据他的主导口昧设的。不消说得，一切都搞得奇形怪状。真是五光十色，变幻无穷，令人眼花绕乱，心荡神驰——差不多都是在《欧那尼》里看见过的场面。到处都是光怪陆离的形象，四肢和打扮都不伦不类的人。一切梦幻般的奇景，只有疯子头脑里才想得出这种花样。固然有不少东西美不胜收，但也有不少东西伤风败俗，有不少东西希奇古怪，有的叫人看了害怕，还有许多叫人看了恶心。事实上，在这七间屋子里走来走去的人，无异一群梦中人。这些梦中人映照着各间屋子的色彩，不断扭曲着身子，竟惹得乐队如疯如狂，宛若奏出配合他们步子的回声。未几，那间黑屋里的乌檀木时钟又敲响了。于是，一时除了钟声之外，万籁俱寂，声息全无。这些梦景顿时凝住了。但等钟声余音消失——其实只有一眨眼的工夫而已——人群中便有一阵几乎强自抑制的轻微笑声，随着远去的钟声荡漾着。于是音乐又一下子响了起来，梦景重现，香炉上散射出来的光线，透过五颜六色的窗子照着憧憧人影正扭曲得更欢．但是，西厢那一间，那些参加化装舞会的还是没人敢去。夜色渐阑，从血红的窗玻璃中泻进一派红光；阴森森的帷幔那片乌黑，令人魂飞魄散；凡是站在阴森森的地毯上的人，一听到近头乌檀木时钟发出一阵闷郁的钟声，无不感到比在远头其他屋里纵情声色的人所听到的更肃穆、有力。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But these other apartments were densely crowded, and in them beat feverishly the heart of life. And the revel went whirlingly on, until at length was sounded the twelfth hour upon the clock. And then the music ceased, as I have told; and the evolutions of the waltzers were quieted; and there was an uneasy cessation of all things as before. But now there were twelve strokes to be sounded by the bell of the clock; and thus it happened, perhaps, that more of thought crept, with more of time, into the meditations of the thoughtful among those who revelled. And thus, again, it happened, perhaps, that before the last echoes of the last chime had utterly sunk into silence, there were many individuals in the crowd who had found leisure to become aware of the presence of a masked figure which had arrested the attention of no single individual before. And the rumor of this new presence having spread itself whisperingly around, there arose at length from the whole company a buzz, or murmur, expressive at first of disapprobation and surprise -- then, finally, of terror, of horror, and of disgust.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是其他屋里都挤得满满的，充满活力的心脏正扑腾扑腾跳得起劲。狂欢方酣，不觉钟声当当，已入午夜。于是，正如上文所述，音乐顿时寂然，双双对对跳着华尔兹舞的也不再旋转；一切照旧出现一种令人不安的休止。但是，这回时钟要敲十二下，因此玩乐的人们陷入深思默想的时间更长了，脑子里转的念头也更多了。也许，正因如此，最后一下钟声的余者还未消失的时候，大家才有闲工夫察觉到来了一个从未引人注目过的蒙面人。大家顿时窃窃私议，来客的消息就此一传十，十传百的传开了，宾客间一片嘁嘁喳喳，纷纷表示不满和惊讶，末了又表示恐惧、害怕和厌恶。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In an assembly of phantasms such as I have painted, it may well be supposed that no ordinary appearance could have excited such sensation. In truth the masquerade license of the night was nearly unlimited; but the figure in question had out-Heroded Herod, and gone beyond the bounds of even the prince's indefinite decorum. There are chords in the hearts of the most reckless which cannot be touched without emotion. Even with the utterly lost, to whom life and death are equally jests, there are matters of which no jest can be properly made. The whole company, indeed, seemed now deeply to feel that in the costume and bearing of the stranger neither wit nor propriety existed. The figure was tall and gaunt, and shrouded from head to foot in the habiliments of the grave. The mask which concealed the visage was made so nearly to resemble the countenance of a stiffened corpse that the closest scrutiny must have had difficulty in detecting the cheat. And yet all this might have been endured, if not approved, by the mad revellers around. But the mummer had gone so far as to assume the type of the Red Death. His vesture was dabbled in blood -- and his broad brow, with all the features of the face, was besprinkled with the scarlet horror.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="完全有理由可以这么说一句：在我笔下描绘的这么个无奇不有的大会里，寻常一般人的出现是决不会引起轩然大波来的。说实在的，这个通宵化装舞会未免放纵得过了头。王爷尽管花样层出不穷，但是大家议论着的这个人竟比王爷有过之无不及。就说那些极端放荡不羁的人吧，他们的心里也未尝没有动情的心弦。哪怕那些根本无动于中的人，平素视生死大事为等闲，也难免有些事情不能等闲视之。看来全体宾客对这个陌生人的装束和举止都深表反感，因为它既没有丝毫妙趣，也役有半点礼仪可言。这个人身材瘦长，从头到脚裹着寿衣。一张面具做得和僵尸的脸容相差无几，就算凑近细细打量也很难看出这是假的。不过在这里疯狂作乐的人，对这里种种情形尽管心里不满，还是容忍得了。但是这个戏子太过分了，竟然扮成“红死魔”。他的罩袍上溅满了鲜血——宽阔的前额和五官都洒满恐怖的猩红点。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When the eyes of the Prince Prospero fell upon this spectral image (which with a slow and solemn movement, as if more fully to sustain its rôle, stalked to and fro among the waltzers) he was seen to be convulsed, in the first moment, with a strong shudder either of terror or distaste; but, in the next, his brow reddened with rage.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个鬼怪动作缓慢而庄重，在跳华尔兹舞的宾客中走来走去，仿佛想继续把这个角色扮演得更加淋漓尽致似的。只见荣王爷两眼乍一看到这个鬼怪如此放肆，便不由浑身痉挛，直打哆嗦，看来不是吓着了就是心里厌恶；但转眼间就见他气得前额涨红。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was in the blue room where stood the prince, with a group of pale courtiers by his side. At first, as he spoke, there was a slight rushing movement of this group in the direction of the intruder, who at the moment was also near at hand, and now, with deliberate and stately step, made closer approach to the speaker. But from a certain nameless awe with which the mad assumptions of the mummer had inspired the whole party, there were found none who put forth hand to seize him; so that, unimpeded, he passed within a yard of the prince's person; and, while the vast assembly, as if with one impulse, shrank from the centres of the rooms to the walls, he made his way uninterruptedly, but with the same solemn and measured step which had distinguished him from the first, through the blue chamber to the purple -- through the purple to the green -- through the green to the orange, -- through this again to the white -- and even thence to the violet, ere a decided movement had been made to arrest him. It was then, however, that the Prince Prospero, maddening with rage and the shame of his own momentary cowardice, rushed hurriedly through the six chambers -- while none followed him on account of a deadly terror that had seized upon all. He bore aloft a drawn dagger, and had approached, in rapid impetuosity, to within three or four feet of the retreating figure, when the latter, having attained the extremity of the velvet apartment, turned suddenly round and confronted his pursuer. There was a sharp cry -- and the dagger dropped gleaming upon the sable carpet, upon which instantly afterwards, fell prostrate in death the Prince Prospero. Then, summoning the wild courage of despair, a throng of the revellers at once threw themselves into the black apartment, and, seizing the mummer, whose tall figure stood erect and motionless within the shadow of the ebony clock, gasped in unutterable horror at finding the grave-cerements and corpse-like mask which they handled with so violent a rudeness, untenanted by any tangible form.</div>
