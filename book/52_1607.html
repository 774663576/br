<div class="line_en">The next thing I know I'm on my hands and knees in the cellar of one of the empty houses in the Victor's Village. Faint shafts of moonlight come in through the window wells above my head. I'm cold and wet and winded, but my escape attempt has done nothing to subdue the hysteria rising up inside me. It will drown me unless it's released. I ball up the front of my shirt, stuff it into my mouth, and begin to scream. How long this continues, I don't know. But when I stop, my voice is almost gone.</div>

<div class="line_en">My body reacts before my mind does and I'm running out the door, across the lawns of the Victor's Village, into the dark beyond. Moisture from the sodden ground soaks my socks and I'm aware of the sharp bite of the wind, but I don't stop. Where? Where to go? The woods, of course. I'm at the fence before the hum makes me remember how very trapped I am. I back away, panting, turn on my heel, and take off again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我大脑还没有完全反应过来，身体就做出了反应，瞬时，我已冲出了房间，穿过胜利者村的草坪，把自己淹没在黑暗中。从阴冷的地面泛上的潮气打湿了我的鞋袜，寒风像刀子一样割在我的脸上，可我却没有停下来。往哪儿跑？哪里？树林，当然是。我跑到隔离网边，听到了嗡嗡的声音，才意识到自己已如困兽一般被囚禁了起来。我心慌意乱地向后退去，又急忙转身，向前跑去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I curl up on my side and stare at the patches of moonlight on the cement floor. Back in the arena. Back in the place of nightmares. That's where I am going. I have to admit I didn't see it coming. I saw a multitude of other things. Being publicly humiliated, tortured, and executed. Fleeing through the wilderness, pursued by Peacekeepers and hovercraft. Marriage to Peeta with our children forced into the arena. But never that I myself would have to be a player in the Games again. Why? Because there's no precedent for it. Victors are out of the reaping for life. That's the deal if you win. Until now.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我侧身蜷缩在地上，怔怔地看着投射在水泥地上的月光。回到竞技场，回到那噩梦般的地方。那就是我新的去处，闪现在我眼前的不是竞技场，而是其他的一切：在众目睽睽之下被侮辱、被折磨、被杀死；在荒野中逃生，被治安警和直升机追逐；和皮塔结婚，然后我们的孩子被强迫送人竞技场。我永远不要再回到竞技场去。为什么啊？以前从没发生过这样的事情，胜利者可以终生不再参加抽签仪式。这是赢得比赛的约定。可现在，一切都发生了改变。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There's some kind of sheeting, the kind they put down when they paint. I pull it over me like a blanket. In the distance, someone is calling my name. But at the moment, I excuse myself from thinking about even those I love most. I think only of me. And what lies ahead.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="地上有一块布，是以前刷油．漆时用过的，我把它拉过来，当毯子盖在身上。远处，有人在喊我的名字。可现在，即使我最爱的人，我也不再去想，我只想到我自己，和等待着我的一切。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I hear President Snow's voice in my head. "On the seventy-fifth anniversary, as a reminder to the rebels that even the strongest among them cannot overcome the power of the Capitol, the male and female tributes will be reaped from their existing pool of victors."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯诺总统的话在我的耳边回荡，“为了提醒反叛者，即使他们中最强壮的人都无法战胜凯匹特，七十五届饥饿游戏世纪极限赛男女贡品将从现有的胜利者中选出。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The sheeting's stiff but holds warmth. My muscles relax, my heart rate slows. I see the wooden box in the little boy's hands, President Snow drawing out the yellowed envelope. Is it possible that this was really the Quarter Quell written down seventy-five years ago? It seems unlikely. It's just too perfect an answer for the troubles that face the Capitol today. Getting rid of me and subduing the districts all in one neat little package.</div>

<div class="line_en">Yes, victors are our strongest. They're the ones who survived the arena and slipped the noose of poverty that strangles the rest of us.

<div class="line_en">I stumble around the cellar, looking for an exit. How did I even get into this place? I feel my way up the steps to the kitchen and see the glass window in the door has been shattered. Must be why my hand seems to be bleeding. I hurry back into the night and head straight to Haymitch's house. He's sitting alone at the kitchen table, a half-emptied bottle of white liquor in one fist, his knife in the other. Drunk as a skunk.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我开始在地窖里徘徊，急切地寻找着出口。我是怎么进来的呢？我慢慢摸到通向厨房的台阶，看到门上的玻璃已经被打碎了。我的手黏乎乎的，似乎在流血，肯定是玻璃划的。我终于冲到黑夜中，直奔黑密斯的住处。他正独自坐在厨房的桌旁，一手握着一只半空的酒瓶，另一只手握着匕首，喝得醉醺醺的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I sit straight up, throwing off the sheeting. What just went through my mind? There's no situation in which I would ever kill Peeta or Haymitch. But one of them will be in the arena with me, and that's a fact. They may have even decided between them who it will be. Whoever is picked first, the other will have the option of volunteering to take his place. I already know what will happen. Peeta will ask Haymitch to let him go into the arena with me no matter what. For my sake. To protect me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我坐了起来，扔掉盖在身上的布单。我一直想什么呢？我永远都不会杀死皮塔或黑密斯，但他们中的一个将会和我一起进入竞技场，这是事实。他们甚至已经商量好了谁去。无论先抽中哪一个，另一个有权作为志愿者去替换他。无论怎样，皮塔会要求黑密斯允许他和我一起进入竞技场，去保护我。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I'm glad I won only last year. Otherwise I'd know all the other victors, not just because I see them on television but because they're guests at every Games. Even if they're not mentoring like Haymitch always has to, most return to the Capitol each year for the event. I think a lot of them are friends. Whereas the only friend I'll have to worry about killing will be either Peeta or Haymitch. Peeta or Haymitch!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我庆幸自己只是去年才赢得了比赛，否则我就会结识其他胜利者，这不仅因为我会在电视上看到他们，而且因为他们每年都被极限赛组织者邀请为嘉宾。即使并非所有人都会像黑密斯一样做指导老师，他们中的多数人也会回到凯匹特参加活动。我想，他们中的许多人已经成为了朋友。而我所要担心被杀死的朋友只有皮塔和黑密斯。皮塔和黑密斯！">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我得承认，这对那男孩要容易些。他刚才就来了，那会儿我还没来得及把酒瓶上的封条撕开。他求我再给他一次机会，好进到竞技场。可你会说些什么呢？”他学着我的声音说，“代替他，黑密斯，因为机会是均等的，我更希望皮塔不是你在后半生能有一次机会，嗯？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Haymitch bursts out laughing and slams the bottle on the table before me. I run my sleeve across the top and take a couple gulps before I come up choking. It takes a few minutes to compose myself, and even then my eyes and nose are still streaming. But inside me, the liquor feels like fire and I like it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="黑密斯哈哈大笑起来，把瓶子甩到我面前。我拿袖子蹭了蹭瓶口，咕咚咕咚喝了几大口，然后喀喀地咳嗽起来。过了好几分钟我才平静下来，可还是鼻涕眼泪直往下淌，酒精在我的胃里像火焰在燃烧，我喜欢这种感觉。">查看中文翻译</div>

Enough made it into my bloodstream, though, to result in a pounding headache, parched mouth, and boiling stomach.</div>

<div class="line_en">Finally clean, I pull on my robe and head back to bed, ignoring my dripping hair. I climb under the blankets, sure this is what it must feel like to be poisoned. The footsteps on the stairs renew my panic from last night. I'm not ready to see my mother and Prim. I have to pull myself together to be calm and reassuring, the way I was when we said our good-byes the day of the last reaping. I have to be strong. I struggle into an upright position, push my wet hair off my throbbing temples, and brace myself for this meeting. They appear in the doorway, holding tea and toast, their faces filled with concern. I open my mouth, planning to start off with some kind of joke, and burst into tears.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后我终于冲洗干净，披上睡袍，一头扎到床上，也不理会湿淋淋的头发。我钻到毯子底下，觉得中毒一定就是这种感觉。楼梯上传来了脚步声，我像昨晚一样再次紧张起来。我还没有准备好见妈妈和波丽姆。我要打起精神，显出镇静、自信的样子，就像上次收获节仪式那天跟她们道别时一样。我要坚强。我挣扎着坐起来，挺直了腰板，把湿头发从剧烈作痛的太阳穴旁掠到脑后，等着妈妈和波丽姆的到来。她们来到门口，手里端着茶水和土司，脸上表现出无限的关切。我刚张开嘴，想开句玩笑，但却忍不住大哭起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I turn on the shower and stand under the warm rain for a minute before I realize I'm still in my underclothes. My mother must have just stripped off my filthy outer ones and tucked me in bed. I throw the wet undergarments into the sink and pour shampoo on my head. My hands sting, and that's when I notice the stitches, small and even, across one palm and up the side of the other hand. Vaguely I remember breaking that glass window last night. I scrub myself from head to toe, only stopping to throw up again right in the shower. It's mostly just bile and goes down the drain with the sweet-smelling bubbles.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我打开淋浴器，站在喷洒下来的热水里冲了一分钟，这时才发现自己还穿着贴身内衣。妈妈肯定刚把我的脏外衣脱掉，然后把我拖上了床。我把湿内衣扔到水盆里，把香波倒在头发上。我的手很疼，一看才知道一只手的掌心和另一只手掌的侧面均匀地扎满了小刺。我隐约记得昨晚曾打碎了一扇玻璃窗。我把自己从头到脚使劲搓洗，直到再次呕吐时才停下来。这次吐出来的基本上都是胆汁，苦涩的胆汁混杂着馥郁的浴液流人到排水口里。">查看中文翻译</div>

My stomach and head still feel rocky, but much better than they did earlier. I rise, dress, and braid back my hair. Before I go down, I pause at the top of the stairs, feeling slightly embarrassed about the way I've handled the news of the Quarter Quell. My erratic flight, drinking with Haymitch, weeping. Given the circumstances, I guess I deserve one day of indulgence. I'm glad the cameras weren't here for it, though.</div>

<div class="line_en">Downstairs, my mother and Prim embrace me again, but they're not overly emotional. I know they're holding things in to make it easier on me. Looking at Prim's face, it's hard to imagine she's the same frail little girl I left behind on reaping day nine months ago. The combination of that ordeal and all that has followed -- the cruelty in the district, the parade of sick and wounded that she often treats by herself now if my mother's hands are too full -- these things have aged her years. She's grown quite a bit, too; we're practically the same height now, but that isn't what makes her seem so much older.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到了楼下，妈妈和波丽姆又一次拥抱着我，可她们的情绪并不激动。我明白，她们在抑制自己的感情，好让我觉得好受些。看着波丽姆的脸，很难相信她就是九个月前收获节那天我离开家时那个孱弱的小姑娘。经过了这一切痛苦和不幸的折磨…十二区残酷的生活现实、妈妈不在时她独自处理受伤生病的普通人…这所有的一切都让她迅速地长大了。她的个头也长了不少；实际上，我们俩已经一般高了，可这并不是让她看上去长大的原因。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But after a few days, we agree to act like Careers, because this is the best way to get Peeta ready as well. Every night we watch the old recaps of the Games that the remaining victors won. I realize we never met any of them on the Victory Tour, which seems odd in retrospect. When I bring it up, Haymitch says the last thing President Snow would've wanted was to show Peeta and me -- especially me -- bonding with other victors in potentially rebellious districts. Victors have a special status, and if they appeared to be supporting my defiance of the Capitol, it would've been dangerous politically. Adjusting for age, I realize some of our opponents may be elderly, which is both sad and reassuring. Peeta takes copious notes, Haymitch volunteers information about the victors' personalities, and slowly we begin to know our competition.</div>

Predictions on who will be victor of the victors show us among the favorites. Even Gale steps into the picture on Sundays, although he's got no love for Peeta or Haymitch, and teaches us all he knows about snares.
