<div class="line_en">Wang turned on his phone, checked his messages, and returned a few calls. He promised he'd be at work tomorrow. At dinner, he followed Da Shi's advice and drank some more. But he didn't feel sleepy. After his wife went to bed, he sat in front of the computer, put on his new V-suit, and logged into Three Body.</div>

<div class="line_en">Desolate plain at dawn. Wang stood in front of King Zhou's pyramid. The snow that had once covered it was gone, and the blocks of stone were pockmarked by erosion. The ground was now a different color. In the distance were a few massive buildings that Wang guessed were dehydratories, but they were of a different design than the ones he had seen last time. Everything told him that eons had passed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="黎明的荒原，汪淼站在纣王的金字塔前，覆盖它的积雪早已消失，构筑金字塔的大石块表面被风化得坑坑洼洼，大地已是另一种颜色。远处有几幢巨大的建筑物。汪淼猜那都是干仓，但形状与上次所见已完全不同，一切都表明，漫长的岁月已经流逝。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">By the faint dawn light, Wang looked for the entrance. When he found it, he saw that the opening had been sealed by blocks of stone. But next to it, there was now a staircase carved into the pyramid leading all the way to the apex. He looked up and saw that the top had been flattened into a platform. The pyramid, once Egyptian in style, now resembled an Aztec one.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="借着天边的展曦，汪淼寻找着金字塔的入口，在那个位置，他看到入口已经被石块封死了，但同时看到旁边新修了一条长长的石阶，直通金字塔的顶部。他仰望高高的塔顶，看到原来那直指苍穹的塔顶已被削平了，成为一个平台，这座金字塔也由埃及式变为阿兹特克式。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Wang climbed up the stairs and reached the apex. The platform looked like an ancient astronomical observatory. In one corner was a telescope several meters high, and next to it were a few smaller telescopes. In another corner were a few strange instruments that reminded him of ancient Chinese armillary spheres, models of objects in the sky. His attention was drawn to the large copper sphere in the center of the platform. Two meters in diameter, it was set on top of a complex machine. Propelled by countless gears, the sphere slowly rotated. Wang noticed that the direction and speed of its rotation constantly shifted. Below the machine was a large square cavity. By the faint torchlight within, Wang saw a few slavelike figures pushing a spoked, horizontal wheel, which provided the power to the machine above.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="沿着石阶，汪淼攀上了金字塔的顶部，看到了一处类似于古观星台的地方。平台的一角有一架数米高的天文望远镜，旁边还有几架较小型的。另一边是几台奇形怪状的仪器，很像古中国的浑天仪。最引人注目的是平台中央的一个大铜球，直径两米左右，放置在一台复杂的机器上，由许多大小不同的齿轮托举着，缓缓转动。汪淼注意到，它的转动方向和速度在不停地变化。在机器下方有一个方坑，在里面昏暗的火光中，汪淼看到几个奴隶模样的人在推动着一个转盘，为上面的机器提供动力。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A man walked toward Wang. Like King Wen when Wang had first encountered him, the man had his back against the sliver of light on the horizon, and he appeared to Wang as a pair of bright eyes floating in the darkness. He was slender and tall, dressed in a flowing black robe, his hair carelessly knotted on top of his head with a few strands waving in the wind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有一个人朝汪淼走来，与上次首遇周文王时一样，这人背对着地平线的曙光，只能看到黑暗中一双闪亮的眼睛。他身材瘦高，身着飘逸的黑色长袍，长发在头顶上不经意地缩了个结，剩下的在风中飞扬。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你好，我是墨子。”他自我介绍道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You're right." Mozi nodded at Wang solemnly. Then he moved closer. "During the three hundred and sixty-two thousand years you've been away, civilization has been reborn four more times. These civilizations struggled to develop through the irregular alternation of Chaotic Eras and Stable Eras. The shortest-lived one got only halfway through the Stone Age, but Civilization Number 139 broke a record and developed all the way to the Steam Age."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你是对的。”墨子对汪淼郑重地点点头，然后凑近他说，“知道吗，在你离开的三十六万两千年里，文明又重新启动了四次。在乱纪元和恒纪元的无规律交替中艰难地成长。最短的一次只走完了石器时代的一半，但139号文明创造了纪录，居然走到了蒸汽时代！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You're saying that people from that civilization found the laws governing the sun's motion?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这么说，在那个文明中有人找到了太阳运行的规律？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Of course not. Come, let us see the efforts of the last civilization." Mozi led Wang to a corner of the observatory platform. The ground spread out beneath them like an ancient piece of leather. Mozi aimed one of the smaller telescopes at a target on the ground and gestured for Wang to look. Wang looked through the eyepiece and saw a strange sight: a skeleton. In the dawn light it gave off a snow-white glint and appeared to be very refined. Astonishingly, the skeleton stood on its own. Its posture was graceful and elegant. One hand was held below the chin, as though stroking a long-missing beard. Its head tilted slightly up, as though questioning sky and earth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“当然，来，我让你看看上次文明的努力。”墨子领着汪淼走到观星台一角，大地在他们下面伸展开来，像一块沧桑的旧皮革，墨子将一架小望远镜对准下面大地上的一个目标，然后让汪淼看。汪淼将眼晴凑到目镜上，看到一个奇异的东西，那是一具骷髅，在晨光中呈雪白色，看上去结构很精致。最令人惊奇的是这骷髅站立着，那姿势很是优雅高贵，一只手抬到颚下，似乎在抚摸着那已不存在的胡须，它的头微仰，仿佛在向天地发问。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“这等于没说。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Let me be more specific: The universe is a hollow sphere floating in the middle of a sea of fire. There are numerous tiny holes in the surface of the sphere, as well as a large one. The light from the sea of flames shines through these holes. The tiny ones are stars, and the large one is the sun."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“说得具体些，宇宙是一个悬浮于火海中的大空心球，球上有许多小洞和一个大洞，火海的光芒从这些洞中透进来，小洞是星星，大洞是太阳。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That's a very interesting model." Wang looked at the giant copper sphere again and guessed at its purpose. "But there's a problem with your theory. When the sun rises or sets, we can see its motion against the background of fixed stars. But in your hollow sphere, all the holes remain in fixed positions relative to each other."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“很有意思的一个模型，”汪淼看看大铜球说，现在他大概能猜出那是什么了，“但其中有一个大漏洞：太阳升起和落下时，我们看到它与群星是相对运动的，而大球球壳上的所有洞孔的相对位置应该是固定的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Correct! That's why I've modified my model. The universal sphere is made of two spheres, one inside the other. The sky we can see is the surface of the inner sphere. The outer sphere has one large hole while the inner sphere has many small holes. The light coming through the hole in the outer sphere is reflected and scattered many times in the space between the two spheres, filling it with light. Then the light comes in through the tiny holes in the inner sphere, and that's how we see the stars."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“很对。所以我推出了经过修正的模型，宇宙之球是由两层球壳构成的，我们看到的天空是内层壳，外层球壳上有一个大洞，内层球壳上有大量小洞，那个外壳上的大洞透进的光在两层球壳之间的夹层反射和散射，使夹层间充满了亮光，这亮光从小洞中透进来，我们就看到了星星。”">查看中文翻译</div>

A red sun rose above the horizon, and the numerous frozen lakes and ponds scattered over the plain began to melt. These lakes had been covered by dust and had merged into the dun ground, but now they turned into numerous mirrors, as though the earth had opened many eyes.

<div class="line_en">But as he examined the image in the telescope more closely, he realized that the sun was different from the sun he was used to in real life. The sun here had a small core. He imagined the sun as an eye. The core was like the eye's pupil, and though it was small, it was bright and dense. The layers surrounding it, by contrast, appeared insubstantial, wispy, gaseous. The fact that he could see through the outside layers to the core indicated that those layers were transparent or translucent, and the light from those layers was likely just scattered light from the core.</div>
