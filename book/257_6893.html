<div class="line_en">When he left us alone, we discussed this information in whispers. In the end we decided to go to bed, and then set out the next morning just in time to catch the ship to Hamburg. I woke early, and when I looked out of the window, I saw two men examining our boat, but I decided not to wake Herbert or Startop, who needed their rest after rowing all the previous day.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当他离开我们时，我们小声地讨论了这个信息。最后，我们决定去睡觉，然后第二天早晨出发，正点赶上去汉堡的船只。我一大早就醒了，当我从窗外望去时，看到两个人检查我们的船。但是，我决定不去叫醒赫伯特和史达多蒲，他们划了一整天船需要休息。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Late in the morning we rowed into the centre of the river. We could see the ship to Hamburg coming closer. Magwitch and I picked up our bags, and said goodbye to Herbert and Startop, so that we would be ready to stop the ship and get on board. Suddenly a boat rowed by four men appeared from nowhere and came out very fast into the centre of the river, close to us. A fifth man was steering, and a sixth, his face hidden in his cloak, whispered instructions to the steerer. They all stared at us.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="早晨晚些时候，我们划进河中心。我们能够看到去汉堡的船正在接近我们，我和马格韦契拿起我们的包裹，向赫伯特和史达多蒲告别，以便我们做好准备，那只船一停我们就上去。突然，一只4人划的船不知从什么地方来的，飞快地到了河中心，向我们逼近。第4个人掌舵，第6个人用斗蓬捂着他的脸，向那个舵手耳语几句，他们都盯着我们。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Soon, however, we discovered Magwitch in the water, badly injured, and pulled him into the boat. He told me that he had fallen into the water with Compeyson, and then been hit by the ship. I believed what he said. At the time there was no sign of Compeyson, whose dead body was found several days later.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，不久我们在水面上发现了马格韦契，伤得很重，把他拖到船上。他告诉我，他和康培生已经掉进水里，往上浮的时候被船撞伤，我相信他说的。当时，没有康培生的踪影，几天后，他的尸体才被发现。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Suddenly their boat was touching ours. The Hamburg ship was almost on top of us, and the ship's captain shouted the order to stop engines, but it was too late. At the same moment the Customs officer put his hand on Magwitch's shoulder, and Magwitch pulled the cloak off the other man in the boat. It was Compeyson! And as I watched, he fell backwards into the water, his face full of terror. The huge ship hit our tiny boat with a great crash, Somehow the Customs officers managed to get me on board their boat, with Herbert and Startop, but our boat sank, and the two convicts had disappeared.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然，他们的船撞上我们的船，那艘汉堡的船离我们近在咫尺，该船船长呼喊命令关掉发动机，可是已经太晚了。同时，那个海关警官揪住马格韦契的肩膀，马格韦契扯掉在那只船上另一个人的斗蓬，是康培生。当我观察的时候，他仰面朝天掉进水时，他看上去很恐惧。巨轮撞击我们的小船，伴随着巨大的轰隆声。海关警官们设法把我和赫伯特、史达多蒲救到他们的船上。可是，我们的船下沉了，那两个逃犯已不知去向。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Magwitch was taken to prison to wait for his trial. I arranged for Jaggers to be his lawyer, but Jaggers warned me there was almost no hope of saving his life. Magwitch's thick wallet was handed over to the police, and Wemmick was quite annoyed with me about it.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Really, Mr Pip, to lose so much cash!" he said. "You see, Compeyson was so determined to get his revenge that you couldn't have saved Magwitch. But you certainly could have saved the cash. That's the difference. But could I ask you something, Mr Pip? Would you come for a walk with me on Monday morning?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, well!" he said again. "Look what I've found in my pockets! Let's put them on!" As he had "found" two pairs of white gloves, and his post-box mouth was as wide as it could possibly be, I began to suspect something. And when I saw the Aged come in with a lady, I knew I was right.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“喂，喂，”他又说“瞧，在我口袋里发现了！把它们戴上！”当他“发现”两副白手套时，他的邮箱嘴拼命地张大。我开始猜想什么，当我看见那位老人和一位小姐进来时，我知道我猜对了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I was delighted for Wemmick, but I could not stop worrying about Magwitch. He had been so badly injured that he was moved to the prison hospital, where I visited him every day. I read to him, and talked to him, and did everything I could to make him comfortable. But day by day I watched him becoming weaker, although he never complained. To the prison guards he was a dangerous criminal, but to me he was an unfortunate man, who had at least some goodness in him. I could not leave him now.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我为文米克高兴，但是，我抑制不住为马格韦契的担忧。他伤得如此之重，以致被转住监狱医院，在这里，我每天看看他。我给他读书，给他讲话，我做的每一件事情都能让他愉快起来。但是，我看到他的体质每况愈下，尽管他从来不说。对于监狱警卫来说，他是一个危险的罪犯。但是对我来讲，他是一个不幸的人，只有最后一点儿快乐属于他，我不能现在抛弃他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At his trial Jaggers was proved right. The judge decided that Magwitch, a convict sent away for life who had returned, must be hanged.

<div class="line_en">I noticed, on my daily visits to him, that he was getting much worse. He lay in bed, looking calmly at the white ceiling. Sometimes he could not speak, and just pressed my hand. One evening as I entered his room, he smiled weakly at me.</div>
