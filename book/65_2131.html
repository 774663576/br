<div class="line_en">It rained most of the time. When it wasn't raining, the water was still falling off the leaves of the trees. I was wet, cold, tired and hungry all the time. I was ill. My head hurt, my stomach hurt, my feet and legs hurt and I was always getting little cuts on my body. Worst of all I missed home; I wanted to be back in the village.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大部分时候都在下雨。不下雨的时候，还是有水顺着树叶流下来。我身上总是湿的，饥寒交迫，累得不行。我病了，头痛、胃痛、腿脚也痛，身上总是会有伤口。最糟的是我想家了，我想回到村庄里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I've just lived through the worst two weeks of my life. I feel a lot better now; that's why I'm speaking again. I didn't want to say anything when there wasn't anything good to say.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我终于挺过了一生中最困难的两周。我现在觉得好多了，所以我又开口说话了。没有值得一提的事情时，我什么都不想说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I'm friends with Baby and Brother. I like both of them. Baby is sweet and Brother is afraid of nothing. The two older deer are afraid of everything -- afraid of birds singing, birds not singing, a cloud going over the sun, a leaf falling. When they're afraid, they jump. They're always jumping!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我是鹿宝宝和鹿哥哥的朋友，我喜欢它们俩。宝宝很乖，哥哥什么都不怕。那两只年长的鹿什么都怕——怕鸟叫，怕鸟不叫，怕云遮住了太阳，怕树叶掉下来。它们在害怕的时候，就会跳起来。它们总是在跳。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That's still true. I don't want to be here. Deer are not people. I said I didn't need people, but I think I was wrong. It's hard to think when you can't talk to anybody.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是真的。我不想待在这里。鹿不是人。我说过我不需要和人在一起，但是我想我错了。找不到人说话的日子真是难以想象。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When Mother thinks we're in danger, she pushes me and Baby with her nose. She takes us to dark places in the forest where the trees are crowded together. We move quickly and quietly, in and out of the trees. I'm beginning to feel afraid of everything now. It's stupid. I've not seen anything to be afraid of.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当鹿妈妈觉得有危险时，它会用鼻子来拱我和鹿宝宝，把我们带到枝叶繁密的树林深处。我们在树林里钻进钻出，悄悄地迅速移动。我现在也开始什么都怕。这挺傻的。我没看到有什么值得害怕的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">These deer eat all the time. They like eating from some trees, not others. Mother has to help Baby to get leaves and fruit. She tries to help me too, but deer food is not my food. I can't eat it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这些鹿总在不停地吃。它们喜欢吃某些树的叶子，不吃别的。鹿妈妈要帮助小鹿取到树叶和水果。它也想要帮我，但是我是不吃鹿食的，我不能吃这些。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mother is unhappy because I'm not eating well. Poor Mother! I'm angry with her all day, but I sleep with her like a baby at night. It's strange. My feelings for Mother are very strong -- stronger than my feelings for my real mother -- both good and bad feelings.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因为我不好好吃东西，鹿妈妈不高兴了。可怜的鹿妈妈！我整天都生它的气，但是晚上却像婴儿一样挨着它睡觉。真奇怪。我对鹿妈妈的感情很强烈——超过我对自己妈妈的感情——好的坏的都有。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Father doesn't come near us very often. He keeps walking around, up and down. He stands tall and looks through the trees. He puts his nose high up and smells carefully. He gets the best things to eat and he pushes the rest of the family away if they try to eat near him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="鹿爸爸不经常靠近我们。它不停地四处走动。它个子高，可以望穿树丛。它高高地昂着鼻子，仔细地嗅着。它总霸占最好的食物，如果家里其他成员在它附近吃东西的话，会被它赶走。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I'm getting thin because I don't eat very much. I find a few wild vegetables and a little fruit every day and I drink Mother's milk before I sleep. That's all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因为吃得不多，我瘦了。我每天找一些野菜和水果充饥，睡前喝一些鹿奶。这就是全部。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I didn't wear clothes for the first week and that was terrible because we're in the forest all the time, and couldn't stop getting cuts. So I made some clothes out of leaves. They're not very good clothes and I have to keep making new ones, but they stop most of the cuts and also keep me warm -- well, not very warm, but I'm not as cold as before.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我第一周身无寸缕，非常不好过，因为整天待在森林里，总是会弄伤自己，于是我用树叶做了衣服。衣服不太结实，我得不停地做新的。但是树叶衣服却有效地防止了受伤，同时还能保暖——虽然不是特别暖和，但是我觉得没有以前那么冷了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There's only one wolf. Oops! Mother just pushed me because she wants me to move. Now she's pushing Baby. The family is moving away, going deeper into the forest. Brother doesn't want to run away, and he's looking at me. Will I run away?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="只有一只狼。哎哟！鹿妈妈在拱我，要我跑开。现在它又在拱鹿宝宝。鹿群跑开了，进入了树林深处。鹿哥哥不想逃跑，它正看着我。我要逃吗？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Something happened! Father ran up and knocked me over with his antlers. He wants me to be quiet. Now I'm speaking very softly. All the deer have stopped eating. Only Father is moving now, walking very slowly, putting one foot down carefully before moving the next foot.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有事发生！鹿爸爸跑过来用角把我顶翻，它是要让我安静。现在我说话非常轻。所有的鹿都停止了进食。只有鹿爸爸还在走动，走得很慢，小心翼翼地放下一只蹄子，然后才提起另一只。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I missed him! I'm good at throwing stones, but the wolf jumped to one side very fast. Now I'm throwing each stone as hard as I can.

<div class="line_en">I screamed, because I wanted the wolves to think I was afraid; then they would follow me, not Brother. But when I screamed, I knew I really was afraid, and the wolves knew it too. That was terrible. All three wolves stopped and ran straight at me.</div>
