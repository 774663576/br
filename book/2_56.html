<div class="line_en">During the mid 1950s when I was a kid, my dad worked in a furniture shop at Spadina and Queen in downtown Toronto. Sometimes, I got to go to the shop with him and I made a bit of pocket change running to the restaurant and getting coffee for everybody. I would pass the rest of the day away just hanging around the store, not doing much of anything and not paying much attention to all the hustle and bustle of people and things that were all around me.</div>

<div class="line_en">One day, as my dad and I were driving to the shop, I looked out the passenger window of the car and I saw an old man standing at the street corner. For some reason, our eyes met and held for about twenty seconds as we went by the corner. There was nothing fearful about this man but it was a significant encounter for me. Up to that point in my life, I had given no thought to anyone I saw on the street, in stores or anywhere else. My life was my family and my friends on the block and that was it. I had no interest in anyone beyond that circle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一天，爸爸和我开车到店里去的时候，我透过乘客座旁的车窗，看见那个街角处站着一位老人。出于某种原因，当车子拐过街角时，我们四目相对了，并且持续了大约20秒钟。这个老人没有什么令人害怕的地方，但这次相遇对我而言意义重大。在人生的那个结点之前，我从未留意过任何一个我在街上、在商店里或在其他地方看见的人。我的生活就只有我的家人和同个街区的朋友，仅此而已。我对那个生活圈以外的任何人都不感兴趣。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But I was intrigued by that old man. For the first time I had an empathy and an interest in what that person was all about. What kind of life had he lived? Where had he been in his time? How had he come to this corner just at the moment I was going by?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，我却对那个老人感兴趣。我第一次用了心思，对那个人的一切感到好奇。他的生活曾经是怎样的呢？他这辈子去过哪些地方呢？就在我要经过的那一刻，他是怎样来到这个街角的呢？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">If I ever have the opportunity to speak to a young person today, I do my best to convey this message. But unfortunately, young people are too busy to heed good advice. Much like I was so many years ago. Youth indeed is so often wasted on the young.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如今，如果我有机会和年轻人交谈，我就会尽力传达这个意思。可遗憾的是，年轻人都太忙了，无暇留意金玉良言，这很像多年前的我。诚然，青春往往就是在年轻的时候被白白浪费掉了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We are inundated by warnings from great thinkers in our society encouraging us to "stop and smell the roses". But I'm afraid it has taken me decades to really appreciate the wisdom of these words.</div>

<div class="line_en">If I had the chance, I would tell young people to stop what they are doing and look around. I would tell them to try as hard as they could to fully understand what is right in their line of sight, what is in the range of their hearing at the moment, what is in their immediate reach and grasp.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果有机会，我会告诉年轻人放下手中的活，看看四周。我会告诉他们尽可能努力地去弄明白，他们视线所及看到的究竟是什么，那一刻在他们听觉范围内传入耳朵的是什么，他们眼下够得着又抓得住的是什么。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Over the years I had long forgotten about this old man, but he came to mind for me recently and I remembered those twenty seconds or so that I looked into the eyes of a stranger and wondered what he was all about.</div>

<div class="line_en">I would like so much to tell people, especially young people, that if you are thoughtless and indifferent to others on your road in life, then you are missing life itself. Do not be intrusive or tactless, for heaven's sake, but take a moment and ask someone, how did you come here or how did you get into this business?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我很乐意告诉人们，特别是年轻人，如果你在人生路上对他人漠不关心、冷漠相待，那么，与你擦肩而过的就是生活本身。看在老天的份上，不要干涉别人的私事或者说不得体的话，但你可以花上一些时间问问某个人，他是怎么来到这里的或者他是怎么踏入这一行。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">No matter what that person tells you, their answer will make you richer. You can grow emotionally, you can excel as a person and you can be wealthy by every measure if you just appreciate the gifts that people and life all around you are ready to give right at this moment just by their simple presence.</div>

<div class="line_en">Recently, I attended a trade show at the convention centre in downtown Toronto. During the lunch break I went to a book sale along the trendy Queen West area. I was thinking about returning to the show or carrying on my walk when I realized I was standing at the corner of Spadina and Queen. At that moment a car went by and I caught the eye of a young boy looking at me from the passenger window. We looked at each other for about twenty seconds before the car disappeared around the corner. I wondered if that boy was thinking about what sort of person I was.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最近，我参加了在多伦多市区会展中心举办的交易会。午餐休息的时候，我去了一个书市，就在时尚新潮的皇后西街那儿。我正在犹豫着是回到交易会还是继续向前走，这时我意识到自己就站在司帕蒂娜街与皇后街相交的街角上。正在这时，一辆小汽车从我面前驶过，我与一个从乘客座车窗朝外看的小男孩四目交汇。我们彼此打量了大约20秒钟，然后汽车转过街角消失了。我不知道那个男孩是否在想我是个什么样的人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I wondered if 50 years had just simply flashed by or whether that boy and I had just simply changed places in the span of 20 seconds.</div>

<div class="line_en">Before I returned to the trade show, I stopped at a florist. I bought a rose and put it in the lapel of my jacket. For some reason, I felt it was the most important thing I would do for the rest of the day.</div>
