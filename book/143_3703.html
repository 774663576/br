<div class="line_en">Velardi had six carabinieri officers, fully armed, with him. He greeted Michael and Clemenza with a cold courtesy and spoke to Clemenza first. "You are an American citizen," he said. "You have a passport that says you have come here to pay your brother a visit. Don Domenico Clemenza of Trapani. A very respectable man, they tell me. A man of respect." He said the traditional phrase with obvious sarcasm. "We find you with this Michael Corleone, and you are armed with lethal weapons in the town where Turi Guiliano has met his death just a few hours before. Would you care to make a statement?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"In America do you shoot rabbits with a machine pistol?" Inspector Velardi asked. He turned to Michael Corleone. "We have met before, you and I, we know what you are here for.

You are an accomplice in a criminal conspiracy to effect his escape. I am no longer required to treat scum like you as if you were human.

<div class="line_cn" title="唐·克罗切在韦拉尔迪警督办公桌旁的一张扶手椅上坐下，摸了摸额头，以非常平静、似乎毫无威胁的语调说：“鉴于我们的友谊，给特雷扎部长打个电话，问问他对这个问题的意见。这点面子你不会不给我吧？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was Don Croce, no better dressed than Michael remembered him from that famous lunch. His mahogany face was just as impassive. He waddled over to Michael and embraced him. He shook hands with Peter Clemenza. Then he turned and still standing stared Inspector Velardi full in the face without saying a word. A brute force emanated from that hulk of a man. Power radiated from his face and eyes. "These two men are my friends," he said. "What possible reason do you have to treat them with disrespect?" There was no anger in that voice, no emotion. It seemed merely to be a question demanding an answer with facts. It was also a voice that stated there was no fact that could justify their arrest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="来人是唐·克罗切。他身上的衣着不比迈克尔记忆中在那次著名的午餐上穿得好。他那张红木般的脸上依然是那样毫无表情。他还摇摇摆摆地走到迈克尔跟前拥抱了他一下，然后和彼得·克莱门扎握了握手。接着他转过身，目不转睛地看着韦拉尔迪警督，一言不发。这个人的身上有一股强大的力量，通过他的脸和眼睛放射出来。“这两个人是我的朋友，”他说，“你有什么理由这样粗暴地对待他们？”他的语气中没有愤怒，也没有任何情绪。他似乎只是提出一个需要用事实来回答的问题。他似乎在说，逮捕他们是没有正当理由、没有任何事实根据的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Inspector slowly picked up the phone, his eyes watching Don Croce. He listened for a few minutes, then said, "Yes, Your Excellency," and hung up the phone. He slumped down in his chair and said to Michael and Peter Clemenza, "You are free to go."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="警督慢慢地拿起电话，眼睛一直盯着唐·克罗切。他听了几分钟之后说了一声“是，阁下”，随即放下电话。他一屁股坐在椅子上，对迈克尔和彼得·克莱门扎说：“你们可以走了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="韦拉尔迪警督摇了摇头。他那双蓝眼睛已经不再那么冷酷，而是充满了仇恨。“我们从来就不是朋友，”他说，“我以前是奉命行事，现在吉里安诺死了，命令就没有约束力了。这两人要交给地方法院。如果我有这么大权力的话，你也将和他们一起出庭。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Don Croce rose to his feet and shepherded Michael and Clemenza out of the room with a shooing motion, as if they were chickens entrapped in a yard. Then he turned to Inspector Velardi. "I have treated you with every courtesy this past year though you are a foreigner in my Sicily. And yet here in front of friends and in front of your fellow officers you have shown disrespect to my person. But I'm not the man to hold a grudge. I hope in the near future we can have dinner together and renew our friendship with a clearer understanding."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="唐·克罗切站起来，就像吆喝被关在院子里的鸡一样，带着迈克尔和克莱门扎匆匆离去。接着他回身对韦拉尔迪警督说：“虽然你在我的西西里是个外来户，在过去的一年里，我待你不薄，可是你当着我的朋友和各位警官的面，对我表现得大为不恭。不过我这个人不会记仇。我希望在最近的将来，我们再在一起吃一顿饭，重续我们的友谊，更好地相互理解。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Two days later Michael was home. There was a family feast -- his brother Fredo flew in from Vegas, there was Connie and her husband Carlo, there was Clemenza and his wife, Tom Hagen and his wife. They hugged and toasted Michael and commented on how well he looked. Nobody talked about his years of exile, nobody seemed to notice that the side of his face was caved in, nobody mentioned Sonny's death. It was a family homecoming party as if he had been away to college or on a long vacation. He was seated on his father's right. Finally he was safe.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两天之后，迈克尔回到家里。家里为他举办了一次宴会，参加的有从拉斯维加斯飞回来的哥哥弗雷多，还有康妮和她丈夫卡洛，克莱门扎和他的妻子，汤姆·黑根和他的妻子。他们和迈克尔拥抱，向他敬酒，说他气色很好。没有人提起他被流放的岁月，似乎谁也没有注意他脸上的那道深深的疤痕，而且谁也没有谈及桑尼的死。这是为他接风的家宴，仿佛他是去外地上大学或者刚度完长假回来。他的座位被安排在他父亲的右侧。他终于安全了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It took a full minute for Michael to grasp what his father had said and what it meant. Then, for the first time in his life, he was truly angry with his father. His face white, he said, "Does that mean we were working with Don Croce all the time? Does that mean I was betraying Guiliano instead of helping him? That I was lying to his parents? That you betrayed your friends and led their son to his death? That you used me like a fool, a Judas goat? Pop, my God, Guiliano was a good man, a true hero to the poor people of Sicily. We must release the Testament."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="过了整整一分钟，迈克尔才明白了他父亲在说什么以及这句话的意思。接下来他真的生他父亲的气了，这是他有生以来的第一次。他面色煞白地说：“这是不是说我们一直在和唐·克罗切合作？这是不是说我没有帮助吉里安诺，而是背叛了他？我对他的父母亲撒了谎？你背叛了你的朋友，把他们的儿子引上了绝路？你把我当成傻瓜，像利用犹大的山羊那样利用了我？爸爸，我的天哪，吉里安诺是个好人，是西西里穷人心目中真正的英雄。我们必须公开那份遗嘱。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Michael was still puzzled. "Why did they do it? We have the Testament that proves the government was hand in glove with Guiliano. The Italian government will fall when the papers print what we give them. It doesn't make any sense at all."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈克尔依然不解。“他们为什么这么做呢？我们有这份遗嘱，可以证明政府和吉里安诺在暗中有交易。如果我们把这份东西透露给新闻界，意大利政府会垮台。这是毫无疑问的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

I made no bargain with Don Croce to betray Guiliano. The plane was waiting, Clemenza and his men were instructed to help you in every way. Don Croce did want Guiliano to escape, it was the easiest way. But Guiliano swore a vendetta against him and lingered hoping to fulfill it. He could have come to you within a few days, but he stayed away to make a final try. That is what undid him."</div>

<div class="line_en">It was the first lesson Michael received from his father and the one he learned best. It was to color his future life, persuade him to make terrible decisions he could never have dreamed of making before. It changed his perception of honor and his awe of heroism. It helped him to survive, but it made him unhappy. For despite the fact that his father did not envy Guiliano, Michael did.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是迈克尔跟他父亲学的第一课，而且也是他学得最好的一课。这将使他未来的生活增添光彩，促使他作出一些他原来做梦也不敢想象的惊心动魄的重大决定。它改变了他关于荣誉的概念，也改变了他对英雄主义的崇拜。它帮助他绝处逢生，但却使他生活得很不愉快。虽然他父亲并不羡慕吉里安诺，迈克尔却羡慕不已。">查看中文翻译</div>
