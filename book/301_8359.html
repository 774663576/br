<div class="line_en">Years passed by; surrounded by the good life, Siddhartha hardly felt them fading away. He had become rich, for quite a while he possessed a house of his own and his own servants, and a garden before the city by the river. The people liked him, they came to him, whenever they needed money or advice, but there was nobody close to him, except Kamala.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="岁月荏苒，席特哈尔塔置身在安乐中几乎没觉察年华的流逝。他富了，早就拥有了一幢自己的住宅以及自己的仆人，在城郊的河边还另有一个花园。人们都喜欢他，需要钱或忠告时就来找他，可是除了卡玛拉，没有人跟他特别亲近。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For a long time, Siddhartha had lived the life of the world and of lust, though without being a part of it. His senses, which he had killed off in hot years as a Samana, had awoken again, he had tasted riches, had tasted lust, had tasted power; nevertheless he had still remained in his heart for a long time a Samana; Kamala, being smart, had realized this quite right. It was still the art of thinking, of waiting, of fasting, which guided his life; still the people of the world, the childlike people, had remained alien to him as he was alien to them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="席特哈尔塔过了很长时间的世俗生活和性爱生活，却并没有完全属于它。他在狂热的沙门年代里扼杀的性欲又苏醒了，他尝到了财富的滋味，尝到了肉欲的滋味，尝到了权势的滋味，但他心里很长时间仍是个沙门，而聪明的卡玛拉也准确地看清了这一点。仍然是思考、等待和斋戒的艺术引导着他的生活，他对世俗的人们，对那些孩子般的俗人依然生疏，正像他们也不熟悉他一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That high, bright state of being awake, which he had experienced that one time at the height of his youth, in those days after Gotama's sermon, after the separation from Govinda, that tense expectation, that proud state of standing alone without teachings and without teachers, that supple willingness to listen to the divine voice in his own heart, had slowly become a memory, had been fleeting; distant and quiet, the holy source murmured, which used to be near, which used to murmur within himself. Nevertheless, many things he had learned from the Samanas, he had learned from Gotama, he had learned from his father the Brahman, had remained within him for a long time afterwards: moderate living, joy of thinking, hours of meditation, secret knowledge of the self, of his eternal entity, which is neither body nor consciousness. Many a part of this he still had, but one part after another had been submerged and had gathered dust. Just as a potter's wheel, once it has been set in motion, will keep on turning for a long time and only slowly lose its vigour and come to a stop, thus Siddhartha's soul had kept on turning the wheel of asceticism, the wheel of thinking, the wheel of differentiation for a long time, still turning, but it turned slowly and hesitantly and was close to coming to a standstill. Slowly, like humidity entering the dying stem of a tree, filling it slowly and making it rot, the world and sloth had entered Siddhartha's soul, slowly it filled his soul, made it heavy, made it tired, put it to sleep. On the other hand, his senses had become alive, there was much they had learned, much they had experienced.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他以前在青春年代里体验过的那种高度敏锐的清醒，在听戈塔马讲经之后的日子里，在与戈文达分手后的日子里，他体验过的那种高度敏锐的清醒，那种紧张的期待，那种既无学说又无师长的值得自豪的独立，那种准备在自己内心倾听神灵声音的灵活决心，都渐渐变成了回忆，变成了过去；原来离他很近的在他心中流过的圣泉，已经是在远处轻轻地流淌了。他向沙门学到的许多东西，他向戈塔马学到的许多东西，他向婆罗门父亲学到的许多东西，依然长时间地留在他心里：节俭的生活，思考的乐趣，潜修的光阴，还有对自己，即对那个既非肉体又非意识的永恒自我的悄然认知。它们有的确实还留在他心里，但是，毕竟已一个接一个地消失，被尘土掩盖了。就像制陶工匠的圆盘，一旦转动起来就会久久地转个不停，最后才慢慢地减速和停止那样，席特哈尔塔心里的苦修之轮、思考之轮和分辨之轮也是这样久久地转动不已，现在仍在转动，但是已经慢了，晃动了，接近停止了。就像温气渗入正在枯死的树干，慢慢地充满了它并使之腐朽那样，俗气和惰性也侵入了席特哈尔塔的心灵，慢慢地充满了它并使之学生，使之疲乏，使之麻木。而他的情欲却变得活跃起来，学到了很多，也体验了很多。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But still he had felt different from and superior to the others; always he had watched them with some mockery, some mocking disdain, with the same disdain which a Samana constantly feels for the people of the world. When Kamaswami was ailing, when he was annoyed, when he felt insulted, when he was vexed by his worries as a merchant, Siddhartha had always watched it with mockery. Just slowly and imperceptibly, as the harvest seasons and rainy seasons passed by, his mockery had become more tired, his superiority had become more quiet. Just slowly, among his growing riches, Siddhartha had assumed something of the childlike people's ways for himself, something of their childlikeness and of their fearfulness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，他仍然和别人不一样，他感到自己比他们优越，看他们时总是略带嘲讽，略带揶揄的轻蔑，这正是沙门对俗人始终怀有的那种轻蔑。每当卡马斯瓦密身体不舒服，生气发怒，感到受了侮辱，受商人的种种烦恼困扰时，席特哈尔塔总是怀着嘲讽袖手旁观。不过，随着收获季节和雨季过去，他的嘲讽慢慢地不知不觉地减弱了，他的优越感也有所收敛。随着他的财富日益增长，席特哈尔塔本人也染上了那种孩子般俗人的一些特点，染上了他们的孩子气和谨小慎微。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Siddhartha had learned to trade, to use his power over people, to enjoy himself with a woman, he had learned to wear beautiful clothes, to give orders to servants, to bathe in perfumed waters. He had learned to eat tenderly and carefully prepared food, even fish, even meat and poultry, spices and sweets, and to drink wine, which causes sloth and forgetfulness. He had learned to play with dice and on a chess-board, to watch dancing girls, to have himself carried about in a sedan-chair, to sleep on a soft bed.</div>

<div class="line_en">And yet, he envied them, envied them just the more, the more similar he became to them. He envied them for the one thing that was missing from him and that they had, the importance they were able to attach to their lives, the amount of passion in their joys and fears, the fearful but sweet happiness of being constantly in love. These people were all of the time in love with themselves, with women, with their children, with honours or money, with plans or hopes. But he did not learn this from them, this out of all things, this joy of a child and this foolishness of a child; he learned from them out of all things the unpleasant ones, which he himself despised. It happened more and more often that, in the morning after having had company the night before, he stayed in bed for a long time, felt unable to think and tired. It happened that he became angry and impatient, when Kamaswami bored him with his worries. It happened that he laughed just too loud, when he lost a game of dice.</div>

<div class="line_en">Siddhartha, slowly, getting a bit denser every day, a bit murkier every month, a bit heavier every year. As a new dress becomes old in time, loses its beautiful colour in time, gets stains, gets wrinkles, gets worn off at the seams, and starts to show threadbare spots here and there, thus Siddhartha's new life, which he had started after his separation from Govinda, had grown old, lost colour and splendour as the years passed by, was gathering wrinkles and stains, and hidden at bottom, already showing its ugliness here and there, disappointment and disgust were waiting. Siddhartha did not notice it. He only noticed that this bright and reliable voice inside of him, which had awoken in him at that time and had ever guided him in his best times, had become silent.</div>

<div class="line_en">He had been captured by the world, by lust, covetousness, sloth, and finally also by that vice which he had used to despise and mock the most as the most foolish one of all vices: greed. Property, possessions, and riches also had finally captured him; they were no longer a game and trifles to him, had become a shackle and a burden. On a strange and devious way, Siddhartha had gotten into this final and most base of all dependencies, by means of the game of dice. It was since that time, when he had stopped being a Samana in his heart, that Siddhartha began to play the game for money and precious things, which he at other times only joined with a smile and casually as a custom of the childlike people, with an increasing rage and passion.</div>

<div class="line_en">He was a feared gambler, few dared to take him on, so high and audacious were his stakes. He played the game due to a pain of his heart, losing and wasting his wretched money in the game brought him an angry joy, in no other way he could demonstrate his disdain for wealth, the merchants' false god, more clearly and more mockingly. Thus he gambled with high stakes and mercilessly, hating himself, mocking himself, won thousands, threw away thousands, lost money, lost jewelry, lost a house in the country, won again, lost again. That fear, that terrible and petrifying fear, which he felt while he was rolling the dice, while he was worried about losing high stakes, that fear he loved and sought to always renew it, always increase it, always get it to a slightly higher level, for in this feeling alone he still felt something like happiness, something like an intoxication, something like an elevated form of life in the midst of his saturated, lukewarm, dull life.</div>

<div class="line_en">And after each big loss, his mind was set on new riches, pursued the trade more zealously, forced his debtors more strictly to pay, because he wanted to continue gambling, he wanted to continue squandering, continue demonstrating his disdain of wealth. Siddhartha lost his calmness when losses occurred, lost his patience when he was not payed on time, lost his kindness towards beggars, lost his disposition for giving away and loaning money to those who petitioned him. He, who gambled away tens of thousands at one roll of the dice and laughed at it, became more strict and more petty in his business, occasionally dreaming at night about money! And whenever he woke up from this ugly spell, whenever he found his face in the mirror at the bedroom's wall to have aged and become more ugly, whenever embarrassment and disgust came over him, he continued fleeing, fleeing into a new game, fleeing into a numbing of his mind brought on by sex, by wine, and from there he fled back into the urge to pile up and obtain possessions. In this pointless cycle he ran, growing tired, growing old, growing ill.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then the time came when a dream warned him. He had spend the hours of the evening with Kamala, in her beautiful pleasure-garden. They had been sitting under the trees, talking, and Kamala had said thoughtful words, words behind which a sadness and tiredness lay hidden. She had asked him to tell her about Gotama, and could not hear enough of him, how clear his eyes, how still and beautiful his mouth, how kind his smile, how peaceful his walk had been. For a long time, he had to tell her about the exalted Buddha, and Kamala had sighed and had said: "One day, perhaps soon, I'll also follow that Buddha. I'll give him my pleasure-garden for a gift and take my refuge in his teachings." But after this, she had aroused him, and had tied him to her in the act of making love with painful fervour, biting and in tears, as if, once more, she wanted to squeeze the last sweet drop out of this vain, fleeting pleasure. Never before, it had become so strangely clear to Siddhartha, how closely lust was akin to death. Then he had lain by her side, and Kamala's face had been close to him, and under her eyes and next to the corners of her mouth he had, as clearly as never before, read a fearful inscription, an inscription of small lines, of slight grooves, an inscription reminiscent of autumn and old age, just as Siddhartha himself, who was only in his forties, had already noticed, here and there, gray hairs among his black ones. Tiredness was written on Kamala's beautiful face, tiredness from walking a long path, which has no happy destination, tiredness and the beginning of withering, and concealed, still unsaid, perhaps not even conscious anxiety: fear of old age, fear of the autumn, fear of having to die. With a sigh, he had bid his farewell to her, the soul full of reluctance, and full of concealed anxiety.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时，一个梦提醒了他。那天晚间，他在卡玛拉那儿，在她那美丽的大花园里。他们俩坐在树下交谈，卡玛拉说了些引人深思的话，话背后隐含着某种悲伤和倦乏。她请求他讲述戈塔马，而且老是听不够，戈塔马的眼睛如何纯洁，他的嘴如何文静优美，他的笑容如何亲切，他的步态如何平稳。他不得不把这个活佛的事儿向她讲了好久，然后卡玛拉叹了口气，说道：“将来，或许要不了多久，我也会去追随这位活佛。我要把我的大花园送给他，信奉他的学说。”可是接着，她又挑逗他，在爱情游戏中怀着痛苦的热情箍紧他，咬他，淌着泪，仿佛要从这空虚而短暂的情欲中再一次挤出最后一滴甜蜜来。席特哈尔塔忽然明白了，淫欲和死亡是多么接受。然后，他躺在她身边，卡玛拉的脸紧挨着他，从她的眼睛下面和嘴角旁边，他清晰地读到了一种令人不安的文字，一种由细线和浅纹构成的文字，让人联想到秋天与老年，就像席特哈尔塔自己，年方四十，黑发间却已经出现了花白的头发。在卡玛拉俊俏的脸上记得写着疲倦，疲倦和业已开始的憔悴，以及有意掩饰的、还没有说出的、也许还没有意识到的不安：害怕衰老，害怕秋天，害怕不可避免的死亡。他叹息着向她告别，心里充满了不快，充满了隐秘的不安。">查看中文翻译</div>

But more than by anything else, he was disgusted by himself, by his perfumed hair, by the smell of wine from his mouth, by the flabby tiredness and listlessness of his skin. Like when someone, who has eaten and drunk far too much, vomits it back up again with agonising pain and is nevertheless glad about the relief, thus this sleepless man wished to free himself of these pleasures, these habits and all of this pointless life and himself, in an immense burst of disgust.

<div class="line_en">With a gloomy mind, Siddhartha went to the pleasure-garden he owned, locked the gate, sat down under a mango-tree, felt death in his heart and horror in his chest, sat and sensed how everything died in him, withered in him, came to an end in him. By and by, he gathered his thoughts, and in his mind, he once again went the entire path of his life, starting with the first days he could remember. When was there ever a time when he had experienced happiness, felt a true bliss? Oh yes, several times he had experienced such a thing. In his years as a boy, he has had a taste of it, when he had obtained praise from the Brahmans, he had felt it in his heart: "There is a path in front of the one who has distinguished himself in the recitation of the holy verses, in the dispute with the learned ones, as an assistant in the offerings." Then, he had felt it in his heart: "There is a path in front of you, you are destined for, the gods are awaiting you." And again, as a young man, when the ever rising, upward fleeing, goalof all thinking had ripped him out of and up from the multitude of those seeking the same goal, when he wrestled in pain for the purpose of Brahman, when every obtained knowledge only kindled new thirst in him, then again he had, in the midst of the thirst, in the midst of the pain felt this very same thing: "Go on! Go on! You are called upon!" He had heard this voice when he had left his home and had chosen the life of a Samana, and again when he had gone away from the Samanas to that perfected one, and also when he had gone away from him to the uncertain. For how long had he not heard this voice any more, for how long had he reached no height any more, how even and dull was the manner in which his path had passed through life, for many long years, without a high goal, without thirst, without elevation, content with small lustful pleasures and yet never satisfied! For all of these many years, without knowing it himself, he had tried hard and longed to become a man like those many, like those children, and inall this, his life had been much more miserable and poorer than theirs, and their goals were not his, nor their worries; after all, that entire world of the Kamaswami-people had only been a game to him, a dance he would watch, a comedy. Only Kamala had been dear, had been valuable to him-but was she still thus? Did he still need her, or she him? Did they not play a game without an ending? Was it necessary to live for this? No, it was not necessary! The name of this game was Sansara, a game for children, a game which was perhaps enjoyable to play once, twice, ten times-but for ever and ever over again?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="席特哈尔塔阴郁地走进了一个属于他自己的花园，锁好小门，坐到一棵芒果树下，感受到心中的死亡和胸中的恐惧。他坐在那儿感受到了自己心中如何在衰亡，如何在枯萎，如何在完结。他渐渐地集中了心思，在脑子里再一次回顾了他这辈子走过的路，从他能够想起的最早的日子开始。他什么时候曾体验到一种幸福，感受到一种真正的狂喜呢？噢，对，他也有过好几次这样的经历。在少年时代他就品味过这种欢乐，当他受到婆罗门夸奖时，当他远远超过同龄人，在背诵诗书、与学才辩论以及当祭祀助手都表现得出类拔萃时。那时他心里就感觉到：“一条路摆在你面前，你的使命就是走这条路，神灵在等着你。”到了青年时代，思索的目标不断向上，这使得他从一大群有同样追求的人当中脱颖而出。他在痛苦中思索婆罗门的真谛，每次得到的真知都只是在他心里激起新的渴求，而在渴求当中，在痛苦当中，他又总是听到这个声音：“继续！向前！这就是对你的召唤！！当他离开故乡，选择沙门生活时听见了这声音；当他离开沙门，投奔那位活佛时听见了这声音；当他离开活佛，走进昏沌之中时还是听到了这声音。他已有多久没听见这声音了？他已有多久没有再攀上高峰了？他走过的路是多么平坦和荒凉！好多个漫长的年头，没有崇高的目标，没有渴求，没有提高，满足于小小的欢娱，却又从来没有知足过！这些年，他一直努力和渴望成为一个跟许多人同样的人，跟那些孩子同样的人，可是他自己却不知道，他的生活比他们远为不幸和可怜，因为他们的目标跟也不同，他们的忧虑也跟他不同。像卡马斯瓦密这类人的整个世界对于他只是一场游戏，一场供人观赏的舞蹈，一场悲剧。只有卡玛拉是他真心喜爱的，是他珍惜的——但她还是那样吗？他还需要她呈，还是她需要他？他们不也是在玩一场没完没了的游戏？为这个而活着可有必要？不，没有必要！这游戏叫轮回，是一种儿童玩的游戏，玩起来也许很有趣，一遍，两遍，十遍——可是，就永远这样玩下去么？">查看中文翻译</div>
