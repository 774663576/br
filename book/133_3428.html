<div class="line_en">I know it may sound like it, but I wasn't completely alone the beginning of my freshman year. Two other freshmen, both featured here on Hannah Baker's Greatest Hits, were also new to the area. Alex Standall and Jessica Davis. And while we never became close friends, we did rely on each other those first few weeks of school.</div>

<div class="line_en">We both expected Ms. Antilly to spew a bunch of psychobabble at us. What it means -- what it takes -- to be a great student. How this school is made up of the best and the brightest in the state. How everyone is given the same opportunities to succeed if they're willing to try.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我俩都以为安迪莉老师会就心理健康问题啰唆一番。好学生意味着什么？怎么才能成为好学生？本校的学生如何优秀，囊括了本州最出色的学生。只要愿意努力，人人都有同样的成功机会，等等。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="安迪莉老师跟我俩讲了让我们来的用意后，我和杰西卡就转过来相互打量着。她双唇微微张开，好像要说什么。可她跟坐在那儿的我能说什么呢？她好像是愣住了，有点困惑，好像上了当。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I close my eyes. I don't want to see it, but it's so clear. When rumors of Hannah's unexplained absence began spreading through school, Mr. Porter asked our class why he kept hearing her name mentioned in the halls. He looked nervous. Almost sick.

<div class="line_cn" title="我闭上眼睛。我不愿意回想，可一切栩栩如生。有关汉娜莫名其妙缺课的流言在学校传开后，波特老师在课上问，为什么他总是在过道里听到有人提她的名字。他显得紧张不安。几乎是心烦意乱。就好像他明知答案，却希望有人跟他说不是的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="我不会忘记安迪莉老师的反应。简短、缓慢地说的话：“或者……不做朋友。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And then the three of us laughed. Jessica and I had very similar laughs, which made us laugh even harder. Ms. Antilly's laugh wasn't quite as heartfelt… more of a nervous laugh… but still a laugh. She claimed to have never tried matching up friends before, and was doubtful she ever would again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们三人都笑了起来。杰西卡和我笑起来很像，结果我们笑得更厉害了。安迪莉老师不像我们笑得那么开怀……笑得有点拘谨……可也还是在笑。她说以前从来没有给人介绍过朋友，估计以后再也不会了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Me: It's okay. I just thought you should know my name if we're going to be such fabulous friends.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="杰西卡：我说了希拉里，是吗？对不起。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Was it pain on Mr. Porter's face? Or was it fear? He just stood there, staring at Hannah's desk. Through her desk. And no one said a word, but we looked around. At each other.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="波特老师脸上的表情是痛苦吗？还是恐惧？他就站在那儿，盯着汉娜的座位。眼神穿过她的座位。大家谁也不说话，只是你看我我看你，面面相觑。">查看中文翻译</div>
