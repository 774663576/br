<div class="line_en">We got to the town and the master's business took a long time. It was late in the afternoon when we started back for home. The wind was much stronger, and as we drove through a wood, I heard my master say, "I've never been out in a storm as bad as this, John." Indeed, I thought so too, hearing the terrible noise of that wild wind in the trees.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们到了镇上，主人办事用了好长时间。当我们往回赶时，已是快晚上了。风更紧了，当我们穿过一片树林时，我听见主人说：“我还没在这么大的暴风雨中外出过，约翰。”的确，我也这么想呢，狂风在树林间发出那么可怕的呼啸。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I wish we were out of this wood," said my master.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我希望我们快点儿走出这片林子，”主人说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One day in the autumn my master had to go to a distant town on business. John harnessed me to the carriage and the three of us went off. There had been a lot of rain, and the wind was very strong. When we came to the river, the water was so high it nearly reached the wooden bridge, and many of the fields were under water. In one low part of the road the water was half-way up to my knees.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="秋天的一天，主人因生意上的事得到远处的镇子上去一趟。约翰给我套上车，我们三个就上路了。雨下得很大，风也非常强劲。当我们来到河边时，水已经快涨上了木桥，大片的田野都被水淹了。在路上地势低洼的地方，水几乎没过了我的膝盖。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But just as he finished speaking, there was a great noise of wood breaking, and a big tree came crashing down through the other smaller trees and fell across the road right in front of us! I was very frightened and I stopped immediately, but I didn't turn round or try to run away. John jumped out and quickly ran to my side.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他话音刚落，随着一阵树木折断的巨响，一棵大树砸过几棵小点儿的树，轰然倒地，横在我们前面的路上！我吓了一大跳，立刻收住脚，不过，我既没有转身，也没有跑开。约翰跳出来飞跑到我身边。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes, sir," agreed John. "We don't want one of those branches coming down on top of us."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是啊，先生，”约翰附和说。“我们可不希望那些树枝砸到头上。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Go on, Beauty," said my master, and he touched me with the whip. I did not move, so he hit me sharply, but I would not go forward.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“走啊，黑骏马，”主人说，他用鞭子碰碰我。我没有走，他狠抽了我一下，但我还是不向前走。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"We can't drive over the tree or get round it, sir," said John. "We'll have to go back to the crossroads, and take the longer road round to the wooden bridge. It will make us late, but the horse isn't tired."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们没法儿从这棵树上过去，也绕不开，先生，”约翰说。“我们得到路口，绕远儿走那座木桥。会晚一点儿到家，不过马还不累。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was nearly dark when we got to the wooden bridge. We could see water over the middle of it, but this often happened when the river was high. But the moment my feet touched the first part of the bridge, I was sure something was wrong, and I stopped suddenly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们到木桥时，天将近全黑了。水已漫过了木桥的中段。河水上涨时，这是常有的事儿。但是我的蹄子一踏上桥，就觉得不对劲。我立刻收住了脚。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What can we do now, John?" said my master.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“现在怎么办，约翰？”主人说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Of course I could not tell him, but I knew the bridge was not safe.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我当然没法儿告诉他。但是我知道这桥不安全。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"There's something wrong," said John, and he jumped from the carriage and began to look round. He tried to lead me forward. "Come on, Beauty, what's the matter?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不对劲！”约翰说。他从车上跳下来四处打量。他试着牵着我向前走。“来啊，黑骏马，怎么了？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Just then a man ran out of the house on the other side of the bridge. "Stop! Stop!" he cried.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时桥那头的屋子里跑出来一个人。“站住！站住！”他喊着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"The bridge is broken in the middle," said the man, "and part of it was carried away. If you come across, you'll fall in the river!"</div>

<div class="line_en">It got darker and the wind got quieter as I trotted towards home by another, much longer road. The two men were quiet for some time, but then my master spoke.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="天色更暗了，当我顺着另一条远得多的路小跑回家时，风小些了。两个男人静默了一阵，然后主人开口了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Thank you, Beauty!" John said to me, and turned me gently round to the right-hand road by the riverside.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“谢谢你，黑骏马！”约翰对我说，轻轻地牵着我顺着河边右首的路走。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"We were very close to drowning in that river, John," he said. "Men may be clever enough to think of things for themselves, but animals know things without thinking, and that's often saved a man's life, as it has ours tonight. People don't realize how wonderful their animals are, nor do they make friends with them as they should."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们只差一点儿就淹死在河里了，约翰。”他说。“人们为自己考虑的时候挺聪明，可是，动物根本用不着考虑就能知道，这经常能救人一命，就像今晚救了我们！人们不知道他们的动物有多棒。本应和动物交朋友，可是他们没有。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"We nearly did," said my master. "But Black Beauty was cleverer than we were, and saved us all from drowning!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“差点儿！”主人说，“但是黑骏马比我们聪明，他使我们没被淹死！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When we arrived back at Birtwick Park, the mistress ran out to meet us. "I've been so worried!" she said. "Are you all right? Did you have an accident?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到家了，女主人跑出来迎接我们。“我担了好大的心！”她说，“你们都好吗？没出什么事吧？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Good morning, John," he said. "Tell me, does James work hard and do what you tell him to do?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“早，约翰，”他说。“告诉我，詹姆斯工作认真吗？他听你吩咐吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One morning early in December, the master came to the stable with a letter in his hand, looking very serious.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes, sir, always," replied John.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是啊，先生，他一直这样。”约翰回答。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"And he doesn't stop work when your back is turned?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你不在，他也不偷懒吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"And if he goes out with the horses, does he stop to talk to friends, or go into houses where he has no business, leaving the horses outside?" said the master.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“如果赶马出去，他会停下来和朋友聊天，或是把马丢在外面而他去乱串门儿吗？”主人问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Nineteen next May, sir," said James.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“19岁，先生，”詹姆斯说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It is young, sir," said John, "but he's tall and strong. He doesn't have much experience of driving, but he has a light touch and a quick eye."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是啊，先生，”约翰说，“可是他又高又壮。虽然还没有多少赶车的经验，但是他动作轻，眼神好。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Never, sir."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“从不，先生。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No, sir," said John. "And if anybody has said that about James, I don't believe it. I never had a pleasanter, more honest young man in this stable."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，先生，”约翰说，“如果有人这么说詹姆斯，我可不信。我在马厩还没碰到过他这么令人愉快、诚实可靠的小伙子呢！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That's young. What do you think, John?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“真年轻。你说呢，约翰？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The master smiled and looked across at James, who was standing by the door. "James, I'm glad John's opinion of you agrees with my own," he said. "I've had a letter from my wife's brother, Sir Clifford Williams. He wants me to find him an honest young groom who knows what he's doing. The man who drives his carriage is getting old and needs a young man who will work with him and be able to do his job one day. How old are you?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="主人微笑着看着正站在门边的詹姆斯。“詹姆斯，我很高兴约翰对你的看法和我的一致，”他说，“我太太的哥哥，柯立福德·威廉爵士来了封信，要我帮他找一名诚实可信的马夫。他现在的马夫年纪大了，需要找一个年轻人和他一道干，而且得准备有一天接他的班。你多大了？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A few days later it was agreed that James would go to Clifford Hall in a month or six weeks, and for the next few weeks he drove the carriage. We went in and out of town, through busy streets, and to the railway station, where the road was narrow and there were lots of other carriages hurrying to and from the station.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="几天后商定詹姆斯在1个月或6个星期后去柯立福德府，所以接下来的几周由他赶车。我们进城出城，穿过拥挤的街道，去道路狭窄的火车站，那条路上还有很多别的马车匆匆忙忙地进站出站。">查看中文翻译</div>
