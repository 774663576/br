<div class="line_en">BETIMES in the morning of the day on which the new Governor was to receive his office at the hands of the people, Hester Prynne and little Pearl came into the market-place. It was already thronged with the craftsmen and other plebeian inhabitants of the town, in considerable numbers; among whom, likewise, were many rough figures, whose attire of deer-skins marked them as belonging to some of the forest settlements, which surrounded the little metropolis of the colony. On this public holiday, as on all other occasions, for seven years past, Hester was clad in a garment of coarse grey cloth. Not more by its hue than by some indescribable peculiarity in its fashion, it had the effect of making her fade personally out of sight and outline; while, again, the scarlet letter brought her back from this twilight indistinctness, and revealed her under the moral aspect of its own illumination. Her face, so long familiar to the townspeople, showed the marble quietude which they were accustomed to behold there. It was like a mask; or, rather, like the frozen calmness of a dead woman's features; owing this dreary resemblance to the fact that Hester was actually dead, in respect to any claim of sympathy, and had departed out of the world with which she still seemed to mingle.</div>

<div class="line_en">It might be, on this one day, that there was an expression unseen before, nor, indeed, vivid enough to be detected now; unless some preternaturally gifted observer should have first read the heart, and have afterwards sought a corresponding development in the countenance and mien. Such a spiritual seer might have conceived, that, after sustaining the gaze of the multitude through seven miserable years as a necessity, a penance, and something which it was a stern religion to endure, she now, for one last time more, encountered it freely and voluntarily, in order to convert what had so long been agony into a kind of triumph. "Look your last on the scarlet letter and its wearer!" -- the people's victim and life-long bond-slave, as they fancied her, might say to them. "Yet a little while, and she will be beyond your reach! A few hours longer, and the deep, mysterious ocean will quench and hide for ever the symbol which ye have caused to burn upon her bosom!" Nor were it an inconsistency too improbable to be assigned to human nature, should we suppose a feeling of regret in Hester's mind, at the moment when she was about to win her freedom from the pain which had been thus deeply incorporated with her being. Might there not be an irresistible desire to quaff a last, long, breathless draught of the cup of wormwood and aloes, with which nearly all her years of womanhood had been perpetually flavoured? The wine of life, henceforth to be presented to her lips, must be indeed rich, delicious, and exhilarating, in its chased and golden beaker; or else leave an inevitable and weary languor, after the lees of bitterness wherewith she had been drugged, as with a cordial of intensest potency.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这一天，她脸上或许有一种前所未见的表情，不过此时尚未清晰可察；除非有一个具备超自然秉赋的观察者能够首先洞悉她的内心，然后才会在她的表情和举止上找到相应的变化。这样一个能够洞悉内心的观察者或许可以发现，历经七年痛苦岁月，她将众目睽睽的注视作为一种必然、一种惩罚和某种宗教的严峻煎熬忍受着，如今，已是最后一次了，她要自由而自愿地面对人们的注视，以便把长期的苦难一变而为胜利。“再最后看一眼这红字和佩戴红字的人吧！”人们心目中的这个牺牲品和终身奴仆会对他们这样说。“不过再过一段时间，她就会远走高飞了！只消几个小时，那深不可测的大海将把你们在她胸前灼烧的标记永远淹没无存！”假如我们设想，当海丝特此时此刻即将从与她深深相联的痛苦中赢得自由时，心中可能会升起一丝遗憾之感，恐怕也并不有悼于人之本性。既然自从她成为妇人以来的多年中，几乎始终品尝着苦艾和芦荟，难道这时就不会有一种难以逼止的欲望要最后一次屏住气吸上一大杯这种苦剂吗？今后举到她唇边的、盛在雕花的金色大杯中的生活的美酒，肯定是醇厚、馥郁和令人陶醉的；不然的话，在她喝惯了具有强效的兴奋剂式的苦酒渣之后，必然会产生一种厌烦的昏昏然之感。">查看中文翻译</div>

She broke continually into shouts of a wild, inarticulate, and sometimes piercing music. When they reached the market-place, she became still more restless, on perceiving the stir and bustle that enlivened the spot; for it was usually more like the broad and lonesome green before a village meetinghouse, than the centre of a town's business.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was as Hester said, in regard to the unwonted jollity that brightened the faces of the people. Into this festal season of the year -- as it already was, and continued to be during the greater part of two centuries -- the Puritans compressed whatever mirth and public joy they deemed allowable to human infirmity; thereby so far dispelling the customary cloud, that, for the space of a single holiday, they appeared scarcely more grave than most other communities at a period of general affliction.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="海丝特说得不错，人们的脸上确实闪耀着非同凡响的欢乐。过去已然这样，在随后两个世纪的大部分年月里依然如此，清教徒们把自认为人类的弱点所能容忍的一切欢乐和公共喜庆，全都压缩在一年中的这一节日中；因此，他们总算拨开积年的阴霾，就这独一无二的节日而论，他们的神情才不致比大多数别处的居民倒霉时的面容要严峻些。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But we perhaps exaggerate the grey or sable tinge, which undoubtedly characterised the mood and manners of the age. The persons now in the market-place of Boston had not been born to an inheritance of Puritanic gloom. They were native Englishmen, whose fathers had lived in the sunny richness of the Elizabethan epoch; a time when the life of England, viewed as one great mass, would appear to have been as stately, magnificent, and joyous, as the world has ever witnessed. Had they followed their hereditary taste, the New England settlers would have illustrated all events of public importance by bonfires, banquets, pageantries, and processions. Nor would it have been impracticable, in the observance of majestic ceremonies, to combine mirthful recreation with solemnity, and give, as it were, a grotesque and brilliant embroidery to the great robe of state, which a nation, at such festivals, puts on. There was some shadow of an attempt of this kind in the mode of celebrating the day on which the political year of the colony commenced. The dim reflection of a remembered splendour, a colourless and manifold diluted repetition of what they had beheld in proud old London -- we will not say at a royal coronation, but at a Lord Mayor's show -- might be traced in the customs which our forefathers instituted, with reference to the annual installation of magistrates. The fathers and founders of the commonwealth -- the statesman, the priest, and the soldier -- deemed it a duty then to assume the outward state and majesty, which, in accordance with antique style, was looked upon as the proper garb of public or social eminence. All came forth to move in procession before the people's eye, and thus impart a needed dignity to the simple framework of a government so newly constructed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，我们也许过于夸张了这种灰黑的色调，尽管那确实是当年的心情和举止的特色。此刻在波士顿市场上的人们，并非生来就继承了清教徒的阴郁。他们本来都生在英国，其父辈曾在伊丽莎白时代的明媚和丰饶中生活；当时英国的生活，大体上看，堪称世界上前所未见的庄严、壮丽和欢乐。假若新英格兰的定居者们遵依传统的趣味，他们就会用篝火、宴会、表演和游行来装点一切重大的公共事件。而且，在隆重的典礼仪式中，把欢欣的消遣同庄重结合起来，就象国民在这种节日穿戴的大礼服上饰以光怪陆离的刺绣一样，也就没什么不实际的了。在殖民地开始其政治年度的这一天庆祝活动中，还有这种意图的影子。在我们祖先们所制定的每年一度的执政官就职仪式中，还能窥见他们当年在古老而骄傲的伦敦——我们妨且不谈国王加冕大典，只指市长大人的就职仪式——所看到的痕迹的重现，不过这种反映已经模糊，记忆中的余辉经多次冲淡已然褪色。当年，我们这个合众国的奠基人和先辈们——那些政治家、牧师和军人，将注重外表的庄严和威武视为一种职责，按照古老的风范，那种打扮正是社会贤达和政府委员的恰当装束。他们在人们眼前按部就班地一一定来，以使那刚刚组成的政府的简单机构获得所需的威严。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then, too, the people were countenanced, if not encouraged, in relaxing the severe and close application to their various modes of rugged industry, which, at all other times, seemed of the same piece and material with their religion. Here, it is true, were none of the appliances which popular merriment would so readily have found in the England of Elizabeth's time, or that of James -- no rude shows of a theatrical kind; no minstrel, with his harp and legendary ballad, nor gleeman, with an ape dancing to his music; no juggler, with his tricks of mimic witchcraft; no Merry Andrew, to stir up the multitude with jests, perhaps hundreds of years old, but still effective, by their appeals to the very broadest sources of mirthful sympathy. All such professors of the several branches of jocularity would have been sternly repressed, not only by the rigid discipline of law, but by the general sentiment which gives law its vitality. Not the less, however, the great, honest face of the people smiled-grimly, perhaps, but widely too. Nor were sports wanting, such as the colonists had witnessed, and shared in, long ago, at the country fairs and on the village-greens of England; and which it was thought well to keep alive on this new soil, for the sake of the courage and manliness that were essential in them. Wrestling-matches, in the different fashions of Cornwall and Devonshire, were seen here and there about the market-place; in one corner, there was a friendly bout at quarterstaff; and -- what attracted most interest of all -- on the platform of the pillory, already so noted in our pages, two masters of defence were commencing an exhibition with the buckler and broadsword. But, much to the disappointment of the crowd, this latter business was broken off by the interposition of the town beadle, who had no idea of permitting the majesty of the law to be violated by such an abuse of one of its consecrated places.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在这种时刻，人们平日视如宗教教义一般严加施行的种种勤俭生活方式，即使没有受到鼓励吧，总可以获准稍加放松。诚然，这里没有伊丽莎白时代或詹姆斯时代在英国比比皆是的通俗娱乐设施，没有演剧之类的粗俗表演，没有弹着竖琴唱传奇歌谣的游吟诗人，没有奏着音乐耍猴的走江湖的人，没有变戏法的民间艺人，也没有逗得大家哄堂大笑的“快乐的安德鲁”说那些由于笑料选出、虽已流传上百年、仍让人百听不厌的笑话。从事这种种滑稽职业的艺人们，不仅为严格的法律条文所严厉禁止，也遭到使法律得以生效的人们感情上的厌恶。然而，普通百姓那一本正经和老成持重的面孔上依然微笑着，虽说可能有点不自然，却也很开心。竞技活动也不算缺乏，诸如移民们好久以前在英国农村集市和草地上看到和参加的格斗比赛，由于本质上发扬了英武和阳刚精神，被视为应于这片新大陆上加以保留。在康沃尔和德文郡的种种形式的角力比赛，在这里的市场周围随处可见；在一个角落里，正在进行一场使用铁头木棍作武器的友谊较量；而最吸引大家兴趣的，是在刑台上——这地方在我们书中已经颇为注目了，有两位手执盾牌和宽剑的武士，正在开始一场公开表演。但是，使大家扫兴的是，刑台上的这场表演因遭到镇上差役的干涉而中断，他认为对这祭献之地妄加滥用，是侵犯了法律的尊严，是绝对不能允许的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The picture of human life in the market-place, though its general tint was the sad grey, brown, or black of the English emigrants, was yet enlivened by some diversity of hue. A party of Indians -- in their savage finery of curiously embroidered deer-skin robes, wampum-belts, red and yellow ochre, and feathers, and armed with the bow and arrow and stone-headed spear -- stood apart, with countenances of inflexible gravity, beyond what even the Puritan aspect could attain. Nor, wild as were these painted barbarians, were they the wildest feature of the scene. This distinction could more justly be claimed by some mariners-a part of the crew of the vessel from the Spanish Main -- who had come ashore to see the humours of Election Day. They were rough-looking desperadoes, with sun-blackened faces, and an immensity of beard; their wide, short trousers were confined about the waist by belts, often clasped with a rough plate of gold, and sustaining always a long knife, and, in some instances, a sword. From beneath their broad-brimmed hats of palm-leaf, gleamed eyes which, even in good-nature and merriment, had a kind of animal ferocity. They transgressed, without fear or scruple, the rules of behaviour that were binding on all others; smoking tobacco under the beadle's very nose, although each whiff would have cost a townsman a shilling; and quaffing, at their pleasure, draughts of wine or aqua-vitae from pocket-flasks, which they freely tendered to the gaping crowd around them. It remarkably characterised the incomplete morality of the age, rigid as we call it, that a license was allowed the seafaring class, not merely for their freaks on shore, but for far more desperate deeds on their proper element. The sailor of that day would go near to be arraigned as a pirate in our own. There could be little doubt, for instance, that this very ship's crew, though no unfavourable specimens of the nautical brotherhood, had been guilty, as we should phrase it, of depredations on the Spanish commerce, such as would have perilled all their necks in a modern court of justice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="市场上的这幅人生图画，虽说基调是英国移民的忧伤的灰色、褐色和黑色，也还固间有一些其它色彩而显得活跃。一群印第安人，身穿有着野蛮人华丽的、绣着奇形怪状图案的鹿皮袍，腰束贝壳缀成的带子，头戴由红色和黄色赭石及羽毛做成的饰物，背挎弓箭，手执石尖长矛，站在一旁，他们脸上那种严肃刚毅的神情，比清教徒们还有过之而无不及。但这些周身涂得花花绿绿的野蛮人，还算不上当场最粗野的景象；更能充分表现这一特色的，是一批从那艘来自拉丁美洲北部海域的船上的水手，他们上岸来就是为了观看庆祝选举日的热闹的。他们是一伙外貌粗鲁的亡命之徒，个个面孔晒得黝黑，蓄着大胡子；又肥又短的裤子在腰间束着宽腰带，往往用一片粗金充当扣子，总是插着一柄长刀，偶尔是短剑。宽檐棕榈叶帽子下面闪着的那双眼睛，即使在心情好、兴致高的时候，也露出一股野兽般的凶光。他们肆元忌惮地违犯着约束着众人的行为准则；公然在差役的鼻子底下吸烟，尽管镇上人每这样吸上一日就要被罚一先令；他们还随心所欲地从衣袋里掏出酒瓶，大口喝着葡萄酒或烈性洒，并且随随便便地递给围周那些目蹬口呆的人们。这充分说明了当年道德标准的缺欠，我们虽然认为十分严格，但对那些浪迹海洋的人却网开一面，不仅容忍他们在陆上为所欲为，而且听凭他们在自己的天地里，更加无法无天。当年的那些水手，几乎与如今的海盗无异。就以这艘船上的船员为例吧，他们虽然不是海上生涯中那种声名狼藉的人物，但用我们的话说，肯定犯有劫掠西班牙商船的罪行，在今天的法庭上，都有处以绞刑的危险。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After parting from the physician, the commander of the Bristol ship strolled idly through the market-place; until, happening to approach the spot where Hester Prynne was standing, he appeared to recognise, and did not hesitate to address her. As was usually the case wherever Hester stood, a small vacant area -- a sort of magic circle -- had formed itself about her, into which, though the people were elbowing one another at a little distance, none ventured, or felt disposed to intrude. It was a forcible type of the moral solitude in which the scarlet letter enveloped its fated wearer; partly by her own reserve, and partly by the instinctive, though no longer so unkindly, withdrawal of her fellow-creatures. Now, if never before, it answered a good purpose, by enabling Hester and the seaman to speak together without the risk of being overheard; and so changed was Hester Prynne's repute before the public, that the matron in town most eminent for rigid morality could not have held such intercourse with less result of scandal than herself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="准备开往布利斯托尔的那艘船的船长，和医生分手后，就悠闲地踱过市场；后来他刚好走近海丝特·白兰站立的地方，他好象认识她，径直上前去打招呼。和通常一样，凡是海丝特所站之处，周围就会形成一小块空地，似乎有一种魔圈围着，圈外的人尽管在附近摩肩擦背地挤作一团，也没人甘冒风险或乐于闯进那块空地。这正是红字在注定要佩戴它的人四周所形成的一种强制性的精神上的孤立；这固然是由于她自己的回避，但也是由于她的同胞们的本能的退缩，尽管这种退缩早已不那么不友好了。如果说这种隔离圈以前毫无裨益的话，此时倒是大有好处，因为海丝特能够同那位船长交谈而不致冒被人听到的风险j何况海丝特·白兰在众人间的声名已经大有改变，即使是镇上以恪守妇道最为著称的妇人进行这种谈话，都不会比她少受风言风语的指责。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The latter was by far the most showy and gallant figure, so far as apparel went, anywhere to be seen among the multitude. He wore a profusion of ribbons on his garment, and gold lace on his hat, which was also encircled by a gold chain, and surmounted with a feather. There was a sword at his side, and a sword-cut on his forehead, which, by the arrangement of his hair, he seemed anxious rather to display than hide. A landsman could hardly have worn this garb and shown this face, and worn and shown them both with such a galliard air, without undergoing stern question before a magistrate, and probably incurring fine or imprisonment, or perhaps an exhibition in the stocks. As regarded the shipmaster, however, all was looked upon as pertaining to the character, as to a fish his glistening scales.</div>

<div class="line_en">Nothing further passed between the mariner and Hester Prynne. But, at that instant, she beheld old Roger Chillingworth himself, standing in the remotest corner of the market-place, and smiling on her; a smile which -- across the wide and bustling square, and through all the talk and laughter, and various thoughts, moods, and interests of the crowd -- conveyed secret and fearful meaning.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="船长和海丝特·白兰没有再说什么。但就在此时，她注意到老罗杰·齐灵渥斯本人，正站在市场远远的角落里，朝她微笑着，那副笑容越过宽阔熙攘的广场，穿透一切欢声笑语以及人群中的一切念头、情绪和兴趣，传达着诡秘而可怕的含义。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Why, know you not," cried the shipmaster, "that this physician here -- Chillingworth, he calls himself -- is minded to try my cabin-fare with you? Ay, ay, you must have known it; for he tells me he is of your party, and a close friend to the gentleman you spoke of -- he that is in peril from these sour old Puritan rulers!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“怎么，你还不知道？”船长大声说，”这儿的这位医生——他自称齐灵渥斯——打算同你一道尝尝我那船上饭菜的滋味呢，唉，唉，你准已经知道了；因为他告诉我，他是你们的一伙，还是你提到的那位先生的密友呢——你不是说那位先生正受着这些讨厌的老清教徒统治者的迫害嘛！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"They know each other well, indeed," replied Hester, with a mien of calmness, though in the utmost consternation. "They have long dwelt together."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“的确，他们彼此很了解，”海丝特神色平静地回答说，尽管内心十分惊愕。“他们已经在一起往了好久了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
