<div class="line_en">These words on the screen represented her latest project, an attempt at a series of commercial, discreetly feminist crime novels. She had read all of Agatha Christie at eleven years old, and later lots of Chandler and James M. Cain too. There seemed no reason why she shouldn't try writing something in between, but she was discovering once again that reading and writing were not the same -- you couldn't just soak it up then squeeze it out again. She found herself unable to think of a name for her detective, let alone a cohesive original plot, and even her pseudonym was poor: Emma T. Wilde? She wondered if she was doomed to be one of those people who spend their lives trying things. She had tried being in a band, writing plays and children's books, she had tried acting and getting a job in publishing. Perhaps crime fiction was just another failed project to place alongside trapeze, Buddhism and Spanish. She used the computer's word-count feature. Thirty-five words, including the title page and her rotten pseudonym. Emma groaned, released the hydraulic lever on the side of her office chair and sank a little closer to the carpet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="手头是她的最新构思——商业犯罪小说系列，主题瞄准了审慎的女权主义。十一岁之前，她就读遍了阿加莎·克里斯蒂的作品，之后又相继读了不少钱德勒和詹姆斯·凯恩的作品。她有充分的理由在这之间辟一条自己的写作道路。不过等真正动手她才再次发现阅读和写作不是一码事——吸进去的未必挤得出来。她发现自己竟连侦探的名字都想不出，更别提完整连贯的故事情节了。再看那笔名，爱玛·T·王尔德，也很糟糕。她不知道白己是不是也像有些人那样，注定一辈子只能习作。她曾尝试过参加乐队、写剧本和儿童读物，尝试过表演，还曾努力在出版界打拼。犯罪小说也许只会是又一次失败，同修习佛学和西班牙语一样，不了了之。她用电脑清点了一下字数：今天一共写了不过五十个字，其中包括标题和那个讨厌的笔名。爱玛哀叹一声，将坐椅一侧的液压升降柄一扳，沉下了一截。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">That line again. For Ian, a joke was not a single-use item but something you brought out again and again until it fell apart in your hands like a cheap umbrella. When they had first started seeing each other, approximately ninety per cent of what Ian said came under the heading of "humour" in that it involved a pun, a funny voice, some comic intent. Over time she had hoped to get this down to forty per cent, forty being a workable allowance, but nearly two years later the figure stood at seventy-five, and domestic life continued against this tinnitus of mirth. Was it really possible for someone to be "on" for the best part of two years? She had got rid of his black bedsheets, the beer mats, secretly culled his underpants and there were fewer of his famous "Summer Roasts", but even so she was reaching the limits of how much it's possible to change a man.</div>

<div class="line_en">The squeal of the smoke alarm indicated that Ian was cooking. She stood and followed the smell of burning butter down the hall into the kitchen/diner; not a separate room, just the greasiest quarter of the living room of the flat that they had bought together. Emma had been unsure about buying; it felt like the kind of place that the police get called to, she said, but Ian had worn her down. It was crazy to rent, they saw each other most nights anyway, it was near her school, a foot on the ladder etc. and so they had scraped together the deposit and bought some books on interior decoration, including one that told you how to paint plywood so that it looked like fine Italian marble. There had been inspirational talk of putting the fireplace back in, of bookshelves and fitted cupboards and storage solutions. Exposed floorboards! Ian would hire a sander and expose the floorboards as law demanded. On a wet Saturday in February they had lifted the carpet, peered despondently underneath at the mess of mouldering chipboard, disintegrating underlay and old news papers, then guiltily nailed it all back in place as if disposing of a corpse. There was something unpersuasive and impermanent about these attempts at home-making, as if they were children building a den, and despite the fresh paint, the prints on the walls, the new furniture, the flat retained its shabby, temporary air.</div>

<div class="line_en">By mid-afternoon he could feel weekend melancholy creep up on him and so decided to practise his mixing. Something of an amateur DJ, Dexter had a wallful of CDs and rare vinyl in bespoke pine racks, two turntables and a microphone, all tax-deductible, and could often be spotted in record shops in Soho, wearing an immense pair of headphones like halved coconuts. Still in his underpants, he mixed idly back and forth between break-beats on his brand new CD mixing decks in preparation for the next big-night-in with mates.

<div class="line_en">Melancholy again, he sighed and crossed to the kitchen, moving slowly like a man recovering from surgery. The massive fridge was full to overflowing with bottles of an exciting new brand of upmarket cider. As well as presenting the show ("Car-crash television" they called it, apparently a good thing), he had recently expanded into voiceovers. He was "classless" they said, also apparently a good thing, the exemplar of a new breed of British man: metropolitan, moneyed, not embarrassed by his masculinity, his sex-drive, his liking for cars and big titanium watches and gadgets in brushed steel. So far he had done voiceovers for this premium bottled cider, designed to appeal to a young Ted Baker-wearing crowd, and a new breed of men's razor, an extraordinary sci-fi object with a multitude of blades and a lubricating strip that left a mucal trail, as if someone had sneezed on your chin.</div>

<div class="line_en">He had even dipped his toe into the world of modelling, a long-standing ambition that he had never dared to voice, and which he was quick to dismiss as "just a bit of a laugh". Only this month he had featured in a fashion spread in a men's magazine, the theme "gangster-chic", and over nine pages he had chewed cigars or lain riddled with bullets in a number of tailored double-breasted suits. Copies of the magazine were accidentally scattered round the flat, so that guests might casually stumble upon it. There was even a copy by the toilet, and he sometimes found himself sitting there and staring at his own photo, dead but beautifully tailored and splayed across the bonnet of a Jag.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他甚至还一了夙愿涉足了模特行业，只不过蜻蜓点水后很快退出——“一段笑谈而己”。就在这个月，他还以“黑社会范儿”的身份出现在一本男性杂志的时尚版，穿着定制的双排扣西装，或呵雪茄，或一脸迷情地躺在子弹堆里，共占去九个页面。数本这期杂志散落在公寓的各处，让客人怎么都能撞上一本。连厕所里也不例外，有时候他就在那里不知不觉地盯着自己的照片——全无生气却包装得俊美，劈腿仰卧在捷豹的机箱盖上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Presenting car-crash television was fine for a while, but you could only crash the car so many times. At some point in the future he would have to do something good as opposed to so-bad-it's-good, and in an attempt to acquire some credibility he had set up his own production company, Mayhem TV plc. At the moment Mayhem only existed as a stylish logo on some heavy stationery, but that would surely change. It would have to; as his agent Aaron had said, "You're a great Youth Presenter, Dexy. Trouble is, you're not a Youth." What else might he be capable of, given the breaks? Acting?

There had been low points of course: a sense of anxiety and crippling dread, one or two instances of public vomiting. There was something about his presence in a bar or club that made other men want to shout abuse or even hit him, and recently he had been bottled off-stage while introducing a Kula Shaker concert -- that was no fun. In a recent what's hot and what's not column, he had been listed as not-hot. This not-hotness had weighed heavily on his mind, but he tried to dismiss it as envy.

<div class="line_en">There had been other sacrifices on his part. Regretfully he had been obliged to shuffle off some old friends from University, because after all it wasn't 1988 anymore. His old flatmate Callum, the one he was meant to start a business with, continued to leave increasingly sarcastic messages, but Dexter hoped he'd get the idea soon. What were you meant to do, all live in a big house together for the rest of your lives? No, friends were like clothes: fine while they lasted but eventually they wore thin or you grew out of them. With this in mind, he had adopted a three-in, one-out policy. In place of the old friends he had let go, he had taken on thirty, forty, fifty more successful, better-looking friends. It was impossible to argue with the sheer volume of friends, even if he wasn't sure he actually liked all of them. He was famous, no, notorious for his cocktails, his reckless generosity, his DJ-ing and his after-after-show parties back at his flat, and many were the mornings that he had woken in the smoky wreckage to find that his wallet had been stolen.</div>

She reached for her glass of wine on the bathroom floor, held it in both hands and frowned at the mixer taps. It was remarkable how quickly the glee of home ownership had faded, how insubstantial and tatty their combined possessions seemed in the small flat with its thin walls and someone else's carpets. It wasn't that the place was dirty -- every single surface had been scrubbed with a wire-brush -- but it retained an unnerving stickiness and a smell of old cardboard that seemed impossible to shift. On their first night, after the front door had closed and the champagne had been opened, she had felt like bursting into tears. It's bound to take time before it feels like our home, Ian had said as he held her in bed that night, and at least they had their foot on the ladder. But the idea of scaling that ladder together, rung by rung over the years, filled her with a terrible gloom. And what was at the top?</div>

Their friendship was like a wilted bunch of flowers that she insisted on topping up with water. Why not let it die instead? It was unrealistic to expect a friendship to last forever, and she had lots of other friends: the old college crowd, her friends from school, and Ian of course.

The intended air of inter-war elegance was further undermined by the clamour and ostentation of the room, the pervading atmosphere of youth and sex, money and deep-fat-frying. All the burgundy velvet and pressed peach linen in the world couldn't stifle the tumultuous noise from the open-plan kitchen, a blur of stainless steel and white.

<div class="line_en">He ordered and then was off to the loo again, taking his second martini with him, which Emma found unusual and vaguely unsettling. The minutes stretched. She read the wine label then read it again then stared into space and wondered at what point he had become such a, such a… mixologist? And why was she sounding so spiky, mean and joyless? She didn't care what the Cigarette Girl wore, not really, not that much, so why did she sound so priggish and judgemental? She resolved to relax and enjoy herself. This was Dexter after all, her best friend whom she loved. Didn't she?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="点完单，他又去厕所了，是拿着第二杯马提尼去的。爱玛感到有些蹊跷，而且隐隐觉得不自在。分分秒秒过去，她一遍遍地看酒水单，抬头盯着上方，琢磨：他什么时候变成了这么一位…调酒师了？而她自己又为何这样一副尖酸刻薄闷闷不乐的腔调？其实烟女郎穿成什么样子她并不介意，并不真的那么介意，那么她又为何摆出一副目中无人的批判者姿态？她决定要放松些，开心些。他可是德克斯特，她最好的朋友，她所爱的人。不是吗？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The remark was so belligerent and sour that Emma visibly winced, and Dexter seemed a little taken aback too, hiding his face in the wine list. "What do you want: red or white?

<div class="line_cn" title="这话大有挑衅的意思，爱玛不再接嘴，而德克斯特也觉过火了，用酒水单遮着脸。“你要什么？红酒还是白酒？我要再来一杯马提尼，然后咱们米点上等的饼干味麝香干白，搭配牡蛎，再尝尝马尔戈红酒之类的。你以为如何？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In London's most amazing toilets, Dexter hunched over the cistern and thought much the same thing. He loved Emma Morley, supposed he did, but more and more resented that air of self-righteousness, of the community centre, the theatre co-op, of 1988. She was so, so… subsidised. It wasn't appropriate, especially not in a setting like this, a place specifically designed to make a man feel like a secret agent. After the grim ideological gulag of a mid-Eighties education, its guilt and bolshy politics, he was finally being allowed to have some fun, and was it really such a bad thing to like a cocktail, a cigarette, a flirtation with a pretty girl?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在伦敦最惊人的厕所里，德克斯特伏在水池上，心里也想着同样的事情。他爱爱玛·莫利，他觉得是，然而却越来越讨厌她的姿态：自以为正义凛然，像个社区工作者，一股合作剧社和一九八八年的味道。她实在太…消沉了。这太不合时宜了，尤其在这个专门让男人体验秘密特工滋味的地方。经受了一番八十年代式的严酷说教和左派政治宣传，他终于可以缓一口气，找点乐子了。喜欢鸡尾酒、烟，喜欢和漂亮女孩子调情，也末必是什么坏事吧？">查看中文翻译</div>

She's nearly thirty years old, all that was a long, long time ago, and it's time she took responsibility for her own life. He gave a pound to the Nigerian man who passed him his hand towel, stepped out into the restaurant, saw Emma across the room fiddling with her cutlery in her High Street funeral dress, and he felt a new wave of irritation.

<div class="line_en">For a moment, Dexter had a fleeting but perfectly clear memory of himself at his mother's funeral, curled up on the bathroom floor while Emma held onto him and stroked his hair. Yet somehow he had managed to treat this as nothing, to throw it all away for dross. He followed a little way behind her. "Come on, Em, we're still friends, aren't we? I know I've been a little weird, it's just…" She stopped for a moment, but didn't turn round, and he knew that she was crying. "Emma?"</div>

<div class="line_en">He rests his head against her and thinks about the small crimson box lined with crumpled silk that contains the engagement ring. For the last two weeks it has been tucked inside a balled-up pair of walking socks, waiting for its moment. Not right now though. In three weeks' time they'll be on the beach in Corfu. He imagines a restaurant overlooking the sea, a full moon, Emma in her summer dress, freshly tanned and smiling, perhaps a bowl of calamari between them. He imagines presenting the ring to her in an amusing way. For some weeks he has been devising different romantic-comedy scenarios in his head -- perhaps dropping it into her wine glass while she's in the loo, or finding it in the mouth of his grilled fish, and complaining to the waiter. Getting it muddled up with the calamari rings, that might work. He might even just give it to her. He tries out the words in his head. Marry Me, Emma Morley. Marry Me.</div>

It is five minutes to midnight, and she should really get back to work.
