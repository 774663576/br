<div class="line_en">Next morning, there was no wind and we were half a mile from the eastern coast of the island. Although the sun shone bright and hot, I hated the thought of Treasure Island, afraid of what would happen there.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天早晨，一丝风都没有，我们距离岛的东岸还有半英里。尽管阳光灿烂而温暖，我却憎恨这个金银岛，害怕可能发生的一切。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Because there was no wind, the small boats pulled the ship three or four miles round the island, to a safe place to drop the anchor. I went in one of them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因为没有风，我们用小船拖着大船在岛的周围绕了三四英里，到一个安全的地方下锚。我上了其中一只小船。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Silver," replied the captain. "He wants to keep things calm as much as we do; he wants the men to wait. Let's allow them an afternoon on shore. If they all go, we'll have the ship. If some go, Silver will bring them back as gentle as sheep."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“西尔弗，”船长回答。“他也和我们一样想稳住局面，他希望他的人不要轻易动手。我建议下午让他们上岸去。如果他们都去，我们就夺回船。如果几个人去，西尔弗带他们回来的时候，他们会像绵羊一样听话。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was hard work pulling the ship, and the men argued. Afterwards, they sat around the deck, and the smallest order was received with an angry look.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="用小船拖大船是件苦差事，大家都在抱怨。然后，他们就坐在甲板上，哪怕一个小小的命令也会遭到白眼。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Guns were given to all the honest men. Hunter, Joyce, and Redruth were told what was happening, and were less surprised than we expected them to be. Then the captain went on deck to talk to the crew.</div>

<div class="line_en">They all became happier at once. I think they thought they would find the treasure lying around on the beach! After some talk, six men stayed on board, and the others, with Silver, got into the small boats.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们一下子都笑逐颜开。我想，他们以为一上岸就能在沙滩上找到他们要的宝藏。他们商量了一下，六名水手留在船上，其他人，包括西尔弗，都登上小船上了岸。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Men, you've had a hot, tiring day," he said. "The boats are still in the water. Any man who wants to can go ashore for the afternoon. You'll hear a gun half an hour before the sun goes down to call you back."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“朋友们，”他说，“大家过了又累又热的一天，小船还在水里。谁要是愿意，下午都可以上岸去。在日落前半小时我放炮通知大家。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I then had the first of the mad ideas that helped to save our lives. If six men were left, we could not take control of the ship. and because only six were left, the captain's men did not need my help. So I quickly went over the ship's side and into the nearest boat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我忽然想到第一个近乎疯狂的想法——正是这主意后来救了我们的命。既然留下六个人，我们就无法控制船；但又因为只留下六个人，船长的人也不是非要我帮忙不可。我迅速逃离大船跳上一只最近处的小船。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">No one took much notice of me, only one man saying, "Is that you, Jim?" But Silver called from the other boat, wanting to know if it was me. Then I began to worry if I had done the right thing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没人注意到我，只有一个人问了一句：“是你吗，吉姆？”西尔弗在另一只船上喊了一句，以便确定是不是我。我又开始担心是不是应该这么做。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The crews rowed to the beach and our boat arrived first. I ran towards the trees. Silver and the rest were a hundred metres behind, and I heard him shouting, "Jim, Jim!" But I took no notice, pushing through trees and bushes, and ran until I could run no longer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="小船都争先恐后向岸边驶去，我们的小船第一个到达。我上岸后就向树林里跑去，西尔弗他们还在百米之后，我听见他在喊：“吉姆，吉姆！”但我没有理睬他，在树和灌木丛间飞跑，一直跑到不能再跑为止。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Silver," said Tom. "You're old and you're honest, or so men say; and you've money, too, which lots of poor seamen haven't. And you're brave. Why let yourself be led away with that kind of scoundrel? I'd rather die than --"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“西尔弗，”汤姆说，“你年纪大了，又很老实，名声不坏——至少人们是这么说的；又很有钱，不像那些穷海员。你很勇敢，为什么不和那些蠢东西断绝来往呢？要是我，宁可死也不——”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Just then I heard distant voices, Sliver's among them, and hid behind a tree. Through the leaves, I saw Long John Silver and another of the crew talking together.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我忽然听见远处有说话的声音，西尔弗也在其中，他站在一棵树后面。透过树叶，我看见高个约翰正和几个船员说话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I was pleased to lose Long John and began to enjoy looking around this strange island. I crossed wet ground and came to a long, open piece of sand, then went on to a place where the trees had branches that were thick and close to the sand.</div>

<div class="line_en">Suddenly, there was a noise of distant shouting, then a long horrible scream. I had found one honest man here, and that terrible, distant scream told me of another.</div>

<div class="line_en">The brave man turned his back on Silver and began to walk back to the beach. With a shout, Silver threw his crutch through the air. It hit poor Tom between the shoulders, and he fell to the ground with a cry. Silver, as quick as a monkey, was on top of him in a moment. Twice he dug his knife into that poor body.</div>

<div class="line_en">As I watched, the whole world seemed to swim away before me in a mist -- Silver, the birds above, the tall Spyglass hill. When I was myself again, Silver was standing with his crutch under his arm, cleaning the blood from his knife with some grass.</div>
