<div class="line_en">There was an additional advantage in this route, which was that it would not at all distract Franz from the effects of the story which Signor Pastrini had told them -- and in which his mysterious host from the island of Monte Cristo had made an appearance. So he was able to sit, resting, in a corner of the carriage and to consider the endless succession of questions that had arisen in his mind, though without finding a satisfactory reply to any of them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这条路线另外还有一大优点——就是可以让弗兰士自由自在地去深思幻想，把派里尼老板细述给他听的那个故事思索一番，因为，他那位住在基督山岛的神秘的东道主竟也出现在那个故事里。他交叉着两臂靠在马车的一个角落里，揣摩着刚才所听到的那一篇奇闻，他想出无数有关的问题来自问，但没有一个问题能得到满意的答复。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Franz had found a compromise that would allow Albert to reach the Colosseum without passing by any antique ruin, avoiding a gradual approach that might deprive the colossus of a single cubit of its massive proportions. This compromise was to go down the Via Sistina, turn due right at Santa Maria Maggiore and take the Via Urbana, past San Pietro in Vincoli, to the Via del Colosseo.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="弗兰士所指定的路线很巧妙，使他们到斗兽场去的路上一座古迹也不经过，这样，头脑里便不会因为看熟了这些古迹，而使他们去欣赏的那座庞大建筑物减色。他所选定的路线是先沿着西斯蒂纳街走，到圣·玛丽亚教堂向右转弯，顺着乌巴那街和圣·彼得街折入文卡利街，到了文卡利街，游客们就会发现他们已正对着斗兽场了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Something else, as it happens, had brought his friend Sinbad the Sailor to mind: this was the mysterious relationship between bandits and seamen. What Signor Pastrini said about Vampa taking refuge on the fishing boats and smugglers' craft reminded Franz of the two Corsican bandits whom he had found dining with the crew of the little yacht, which had gone out of its way and made land at Porto Vecchio, solely in order to put them ashore. The name which his host on Monte Cristo had given himself, spoken by the proprietor of the Hôtel de Londres, proved that he played the same philanthropic role on the coasts of Piombino, Civita Vecchia, Ostia and Gaeta as on those of Corsica, Tuscany or Spain; and, as far as Franz could remember, he had himself spoken of Tunis and Palermo, proving that he operated over a wide area.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有一件事实最使他想起他的朋友“水手辛巴德”来，就是，在山贼和水手之间，似乎存在着一种亲密的神秘关系。派里尼说范巴常常躲避到走私贩子和渔夫的船上去，这使弗兰士想起他自己也曾看到那两个科西嘉强盗和那艘小游艇的船员融融乐乐地一起用膳，那艘小游艇甚至还变更它的航程，到韦基奥港去靠一靠，专程送他们上岸。伦敦旅馆的老板也曾提到基督山他那位东道主的化名，他觉得单是这一个名字就足以证明他那位岛上的朋友的博爱行为不但在科西嘉，托斯卡纳和西班牙沿岸实行，而且也还同样的遍及皮昂比诺，契维塔·韦基亚，奥斯蒂亚和加埃塔沿海一带；而且，弗兰士还记得他曾说到过突尼斯和巴勒莫，这可以证明他的交游范围是多么的广大。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In any case, it is impossible in Rome to avoid this over-provision of guides: apart from the general one who takes charge of you as soon as you step over the threshold of the hotel and who does not release you from his clutches until you step outside the city, there is a special guide attached to every monument; one might almost say, to every fragment of every monument. So you can well imagine that there was no shortage of them at the Colosseum, that is to say at the monument of monuments, the one of which Martial said: "Let Memphis cease to boast of the barbarous marvels of its pyramids and let them sing no more of the wonders of Babylon; everything must give precedence to the vast labour of the amphitheatre of the Caesars and all the trumpets of praise unite in admiration of this monument."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在罗马，要避免这种多余的向导是不可能的。你的脚跟踏进旅馆，一个普通向导便跟上你了，只要你还留在城里，他决不会离开你，此外，每一处名胜地方又有一个特别向导——不，几乎是每一处名胜的每一部分都有一个。所以我们很容易想象得到，斗兽场里是不会缺乏向导的，因为它是万世的奇迹，关于它，诗人马西阿尔②曾作过这样的赞美：“埃及人别再拿野蛮的奇迹金字塔来自夸，我们也别再谈巴比伦的古城名刹；一切其他的建筑物都必须让位给凯撒的斗兽场，一切赞美的声音都应该联合起来歌颂那座大厦。”【注：②马西阿尔（40－104），系公元一世纪时的罗马作家。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">However powerfully all these ideas occupied the young man's mind, they vanished the instant he found himself confronted with the dark and massive spectre of the Colosseum, through the openings of which the moon was casting those long pale rays of light that shine from the eyes of ghosts. The carriage halted a few yards from the Mesa Sudans. The coachman came and opened the door; the two young men jumped out and found themselves confronted by a guide who seemed to have sprung up out of the earth. Since the one from the hotel had followed them, they now had two.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，不论这个青年人是如何专心一致地沉溺在这种种回忆里，他的思绪还是被伟大的斗兽场废墟那一片黑森森的景象打断了，透过废墟的各个门洞，惨白的月光时隐时现地闪烁着，象是孤魂野鬼的眼睛里所射出来的光。马车在苏丹台①附近停了下来，门是大开着的，这两个青年急忙跨下马车，发觉他们面前已站着一个向导，象是从地底下钻出来似的。旅馆里的那个随从向导是跟他们一起来的，所以他们就有两个向导了。【注：①古罗马的一个喷泉。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Franz knew the walk: he had done it ten times already. But since his less experienced companion was stepping for the first time into the monument of Flavius Vespasian, I must say to his credit that he was highly impressed, in spite of the ignorant chatter of his guides. Anyone who has not seen it can have no idea of the majesty of this ruin, its proportions doubled by the mysterious clarity of the southern moon, the rays of which give a light resembling that of a western sunset.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="弗兰士已经到斗兽场来夜游过十次，而他的同伴却是第一次光临维斯派森大帝①的这个古迹，平心而论，虽然那两个向导口若悬河地在他的耳边聒絮不休，他的头脑里还是得了很强烈的印象。事实上，要不是亲眼目睹，谁都想象不到一个废墟竟会这样庄严宏伟，欧洲南部的月光和东方的落日余晖有同样的奥妙，在这种神秘的月光之下，废墟的各部分看来似乎都扩大了一倍。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So, hardly had the thoughtful Franz taken a hundred paces beneath the inner arches than he abandoned Albert to the guides, who were unwilling to give up their inalienable right to show him every inch of the Lions' Pit, the Gladiators' Box and the Imperial Podium, and slipped away by a partly dilapidated staircase. Then, allowing the others to continue the usual course round the ruins, he simply went and sat at the base of a column, facing a hollow depression which allowed him to take in the full extensive majesty of the granite giant.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="弗兰士在废墟的内廊底下走了一百步左右，怀古之情便油然而起，于是他离开阿尔培，反正那两个向导总会照他们的老规矩，领他去看关狮子的洞，斗狮力士的休息室和凯撒大帝的包厢的。他走上一座颓毁的台阶，让他们按照规定的游览路线去参观，自己则走到一个缺口对面廊柱的阴影里，静静地坐下来，这样，他就可以欣赏到这座宏伟的废墟的全景，畅意观看这庞大无比的建筑物。【注：①维斯派森大帝（7－79），罗马皇帝，斗兽场是他建筑的，但落成的时候他已死去。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Franz and Albert did not try to evade this tyranny of the guides, something that would in any case have been all the more difficult, since only guides have the right to visit the Colosseum by torchlight. So they offered no resistance and yielded to their controllers, as it were bound hand and foot.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="至于阿尔培和弗兰士，他们并不想逃避这些以导游为业的暴君。老实说，即使想逃避也非常困难，因为只有向导才可以拿着火把去参观这些名胜。两个青年无法抗拒，只能毫无保留地向他们的引导者宣告投降，因为他们的手和脚被捆绑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He had been there for about a quarter of an hour, seated, as I said, in the shadow of a column and lost in the contemplation of Albert who, accompanied by his two torchbearers, had just emerged from a vomitorium at the far end of the Colosseum and with them, like shadows pursuing a will-o'-the-wisp, was descending step by step towards the seats reserved for the Vestal Virgins, when Franz thought he heard a loose stone tumbling into the depths of the building from the staircase opposite the one that he had just taken to reach the place where he was sitting. No doubt there is nothing exceptional here in a stone coming away beneath the foot of time and rolling into the depths; but it seemed to him that on this occasion a man's foot was the cause and that steps were approaching him, even though the person responsible for them was doing his very best to muffle them. And, in effect, a moment later a man appeared, gradually emerging from the shadows as he came up the staircase, the opening of which was in front of Franz and lit by the moon, though its steps receded into the darkness as they went down.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="弗兰士在一条廊柱的阴影里差不多躲了一刻钟光景，他的眼光跟着阿尔培和那两个手里握着火把的向导的动作，他们已从斗兽场尽头的一座正门里转出来，然后又消失在台阶下面，大概是参观修女们的包厢去了，当他们静悄悄地溜过的时候，真象是几个仓皇的鬼影在追随一簇闪闪烁烁的磷火，这时，他的耳朵里突然听到一种声音，好象有一块石头滚下他对面的台阶。在这种环境里，一片剥落的花岗石从上面掉下来原不算稀奇，但他觉得这种石块似乎是被一只脚踩下来的，而且似乎有个人正向他坐的地方走过来，脚步极轻，象是竭力不让人听到似的。猜测不久就成了事实——因为有一个人影出现了，当他走上台阶来的时候，他便渐渐从黑暗里钻了出来，月光照着台阶的顶端，而踏级则沉在暗处。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It might be a traveller like himself who preferred solitary meditation to the meaningless chatter of the guides, so there should be nothing surprising in the apparition; but from the hesitant manner in which he came up the last few steps and the way that, once he had reached the landing, he stopped, seeming to be listening for something, it was clear that he had come there for some particular purpose and was expecting someone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他大概也是一个象弗兰士这样的游客，喜欢独自欣赏，不愿那喋喋不休的向导来打扰他的思绪，所以他的出现，倒也没有什么可惊之处，但他走上来的态度却有点躲躲闪闪，每走一步就要停下来担心地倾听一下，这使弗兰士相信他是抱着一个确定的目的而来的：他要到这儿来会一个人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ten feet above the level on which both of them were now standing, there was a round hole in the vaulted roof, like the opening of a well, through which could be seen the sky, bestrewn with stars.

<div class="line_en">The person whose mysterious arrival had attracted Franz's attention was standing in the half-light, so that it was impossible to distinguish his features, but not so much as to prevent one seeing his dress: he was wrapped in a vast brown cloak, one fold of which, thrown over his left shoulder, hid the bottom part of his face, while the upper part was concealed beneath his broad-brimmed hat. Only the outer part of his clothing was lit by the glancing ray of moonlight through the opening in the roof, and it showed a pair of black trousers elegantly framing a polished shoe.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那行动诡秘引起弗兰士注意的人是站在一个半明半暗的地方，所以无法分辨他的面貌，但他的服装倒是很容易看清的。他穿着一件棕褐色宽大的披风，下摆的一角掀起盖住他的左肩，象是故意用它来遮住下半部面孔似的，而上半部面孔完全藏在他那顶宽边的帽子下面。他的下半身服装就看得比较清楚了，从破屋顶上进来的明亮的月光，照出他的擦得雪亮的皮靴，皮靴上面是黑色的长裤。">查看中文翻译</div>

At the same moment a shadow passed in front of the light and a man appeared, framed in the hole, staring intently into the darkness beneath him. Seeing the man in the cloak, he immediately grasped a handful of the dangling creepers and hanging ivy, let himself slide down them and, at about three or four feet above the ground, leapt lightly down. He was dressed in the pure costume of Trastevere.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他已经在那儿呆了几分钟，来客开始表示出不耐烦的神气，正当这时，屋顶的洞口外面发出一种轻微的响声，立刻就有一个黑影挡住了亮光，那分明是一个男人的身影，那人正在急切而仔细地察看他身下的这一大片地方，当他看到那个穿披风的人时，他就抓住一簇向下飘垂密密地缠结在一起的须根，顺着它滑到离地三四呎的地方，然后轻轻地跳了下来。他穿着一套勒司斐人的服装。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Albert had never been able to get used to these Italian theatres -- to the orchestra pit where you could not walk around and to the absence of balconies or open boxes. All this was hard for a man who had his own stall in the Opéra-Bouffe and a share in the omnibus box at the Opéra; but it did not prevent Albert from dressing up outrageously every time he went to the opera with Franz -- a wasted effort; for, it must be admitted to the shame of one of the most deserving representatives of French fashion, in the four months during which he had travelled the length and breadth of Italy, Albert had not had a single romantic adventure.</div>

<div class="line_en">Yet Albert was not only a most elegant young bachelor, but also a man of considerable wit. Moreover, he was a viscount -- of the new nobility, admittedly; but nowadays, when one no longer has to prove one's title, what does it matter if it dates from 1399 or from 1815? Added to all this, he had an income of fifty thousand livres: this is more than one needs, as we can see, to be fashionable in Paris. So, all in all, it was slightly humiliating not to have been seriously noticed by anyone in the towns through which they had passed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿尔培不但是一个风流俊俏的青年，而且也有相当的天才和能力；再说，他还是一位子爵——当然是新封的，但在目前，你的爵位究竟导源于一三九九或是一八一五已是不足轻重的了。除了这一切优点以外，阿尔培·马瑟夫每年还有五万里弗收入，这笔款子已大可使他在巴黎成为一个相当重要的人物。所以象他这样的一个人，不论到哪一个城市去，要是得不到任何人的特殊青睐，的确是大可痛心的事情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">However, he fully intended to make up for lost time in Rome, carnival being, in every country on earth where that admirable institution is celebrated, a time of liberty when even the sternest may be led into some act of folly.

All of this did not induce one single woman to reward all Albert's agitation with a solitary glance, even of curiosity.</div>

<div class="line_en">With this in mind, he had rented one of the most prominent boxes in the theatre and was impeccably fitted out for the occasion. They were on the first level, corresponding to our balcony; in any event, in Italy the first three floors are all as "aristocratic" as each other, which is why they are known as the "noble" parts of the auditorium. And the box, which could comfortably hold a dozen spectators, had cost the two friends a little more than a box for four people at the Ambigu.</div>

<div class="line_en">Let all be informed that on Tuesday, 22 February, the first day of carnival, by order of the Court of La Rota, the sentence of death will be carried out in the Piazza del Popolo on Andrea Rondolo, guilty of murder against the most respectable and venerated person of don Cesare Terlini, Canon of the Church of St John Lateran, and on Peppino, alias Rocca Priori, found guilty of complicity with the abominable bandit Luigi Vampa and his followers. The first will be mazzolato, the second decapitato. All charitable souls are requested to pray God for the sincere repentance of these two miserable creatures.</div>

<div class="line_en">This was precisely what Franz had heard two days earlier in the ruins of the Colosseum, and nothing had changed: the names of the condemned men, the crimes for which they were to suffer and the methods of execution were exactly the same. This meant that, in all probability, the Trasteveran was none other than the bandit Luigi Vampa and the man in the cloak Sinbad the Sailor who, in Rome as in Porto Vecchio and in Tunis, was engaged in yet another philanthropic mission.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这和弗兰士昨天晚上在斗兽场的废墟中所听到的完全一样。说明书上没有哪一点有什么不同。死囚的姓名，他们的罪名，以及处死的方式都和他以前听说的相符。所以，那个勒司斐人多半就是大盗罗杰·范巴，而那个穿披风的人则多半就是“水手辛巴德”。毫无疑问他还在罗马进行他的博爱事业，象他以前在韦基奥港和突尼斯一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
