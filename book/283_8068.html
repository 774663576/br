<div class="line_en">After being long fed with hopes of a speedy visit from Mr. and Mrs. Suckling, the Highbury world were obliged to endure the mortification of hearing that they could not possibly come till the autumn. No such importation of novelties could enrich their intellectual stores at present. In the daily interchange of news, they must be again restricted to the other topics with which for a while the Sucklings' coming had been united, such as the last accounts of Mrs. Churchill, whose health seemed every day to supply a different report, and the situation of Mrs. Weston, whose happiness it was to be hoped might eventually be as much increased by the arrival of a child, as that of all her neighbours was by the approach of it.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mrs. Elton was very much disappointed. It was the delay of a great deal of pleasure and parade. Her introductions and recommendations must all wait, and every projected party be still only talked of. So she thought at first; -- but a little consideration convinced her that every thing need not be put off. Why should not they explore to Box Hill though the Sucklings did not come? They could go there again with them in the autumn. It was settled that they should go to Box Hill. That there was to be such a party had been long generally known: it had even given the idea of another. Emma had never been to Box Hill; she wished to see what every body found so well worth seeing, and she and Mr. Weston had agreed to chuse some fine morning and drive thither. Two or three more of the chosen only were to be admitted to join them, and it was to be done in a quiet, unpretending, elegant way, infinitely superior to the bustle and preparation, the regular eating and drinking, and picnic parade of the Eltons and the Sucklings.</div>

<div class="line_en">This was so very well understood between them, that Emma could not but feel some surprise, and a little displeasure, on hearing from Mr. Weston that he had been proposing to Mrs. Elton, as her brother and sister had failed her, that the two parties should unite, and go together; and that as Mrs. Elton had very readily acceded to it, so it was to be, if she had no objection. Now, as her objection was nothing but her very great dislike of Mrs. Elton, of which Mr. Weston must already be perfectly aware, it was not worth bringing forward again: -- it could not be done without a reproof to him, which would be giving pain to his wife; and she found herself therefore obliged to consent to an arrangement which she would have done a great deal to avoid; an arrangement which would probably expose her even to the degradation of being said to be of Mrs. Elton's party! Every feeling was offended; and the forbearance of her outward submission left a heavy arrear due of secret severity in her reflections on the unmanageable goodwill of Mr. Weston's temper.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们两人把这事完全谈妥了，后来韦斯顿先生说他向埃尔顿太太提议，既然她姐姐姐夫来不了，他们两帮人不如合起来一道去，埃尔顿太太满口答应，如果爱玛不反对，那就这么办。爱玛听了不禁有些惊讶，还有点不高兴。爱玛即便反对，也不过是因为极端讨厌埃尔顿太太罢了，韦斯顿先生对此早已十分清楚了，现在也不值得再提出来。要提的话，势必要责怪韦斯顿先生，那样一来就会伤韦斯顿太太的心。因此，她不得不同意一项她本来要千方百计加以避免的安排。她接受这项安排，很可能会惹人耻笑，说她甘愿与埃尔顿太太为伍！她满腹委屈，虽然表面上顺从了，心里却在暗暗责备韦斯顿先生心眼太好，做事没有分寸。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was now the middle of June, and the weather fine; and Mrs. Elton was growing impatient to name the day, and settle with Mr. Weston as to pigeon-pies and cold lamb, when a lame carriage-horse threw every thing into sad uncertainty. It might be weeks, it might be only a few days, before the horse were useable; but no preparations could be ventured on, and it was all melancholy stagnation. Mrs. Elton's resources were inadequate to such an attack.</div>

She had given them neither men, nor names, nor places, that could raise a blush. These were pleasant feelings, and she walked about and indulged them till it was necessary to do as the others did, and collect round the strawberry-beds. -- The whole party were assembled, excepting Frank Churchill, who was expected every moment from Richmond; and Mrs. Elton, in all her apparatus of happiness, her large bonnet and her basket, was very ready to lead the way in gathering, accepting, or talking-strawberries, and only strawberries, could now be thought or spoken of. --"The best fruit in England -- every body's favourite-always wholesome. -- These the finest beds and finest sorts. -- Delightful to gather for one's self-the only way of really enjoying them. -- Morning decidedly the best time-never tired -- every sort good-hautboy infinitely superior-no comparison -- the others hardly eatable-hautboys very scarce-Chili preferred -- white wood finest flavour of all-price of strawberries in London -- abundance about Bristol-Maple Grove-cultivation-beds when to be renewed-gardeners thinking exactly different-no general rule -- gardeners never to be put out of their way-delicious fruit -- only too rich to be eaten much of-inferior to cherries -- currants more refreshing-only objection to gathering strawberries the stooping-glaring sun-tired to death-could bear it no longer -- must go and sit in the shade."</div>

Disputable, however, as might be the taste of such a termination, it was in itself a charming walk, and the view which closed it extremely pretty. -- The considerable slope, at nearly the foot of which the Abbey stood, gradually acquired a steeper form beyond its grounds; and at half a mile distant was a bank of considerable abruptness and grandeur, well clothed with wood; -- and at the bottom of this bank, favourably placed and sheltered, rose the Abbey Mill Farm, with meadows in front, and the river making a close and handsome curve around it.</div>

Mr. Knightley and Harriet! -- It was an odd tete-a-tete; but she was glad to see it. -- There had been a time when he would have scorned her as a companion, and turned from her with little ceremony. Now they seemed in pleasant conversation. There had been a time also when Emma would have been sorry to see Harriet in a spot so favourable for the Abbey Mill Farm; but now she feared it not. It might be safely viewed with all its appendages of prosperity and beauty, its rich pastures, spreading flocks, orchard in blossom, and light column of smoke ascending. -- She joined them at the wall, and found them more engaged in talking than in looking around. He was giving Harriet information as to modes of agriculture, etc. and Emma received a smile which seemed to say, "These are my own concerns. I have a right to talk on such subjects, without being suspected of introducing Robert Martin." -- She did not suspect him.

He had expressed himself as to coming, with more than common certainty. "His aunt was so much better, that he had not a doubt of getting over to them." -- Mrs. Churchill's state, however, as many were ready to remind her, was liable to such sudden variation as might disappoint her nephew in the most reasonable dependence-and Mrs. Weston was at last persuaded to believe, or to say, that it must be by some attack of Mrs. Churchill that he was prevented coming. -- Emma looked at Harriet while the point was under consideration; she behaved very well, and betrayed no emotion.</div>
