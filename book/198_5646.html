<div class="line_en">Harry went down to breakfast the next morning to find the three Dursleys already sitting around the kitchen table. They were watching a brand-new television, a welcome-home-for-the-summer present for Dudley, who had been complaining loudly about the long walk between the fridge and the television in the living room. Dudley had spent most of the summer in the kitchen, his piggy little eyes fixed on the screen and his five chins wobbling as he ate continually.</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry sat down between Dudley and Uncle Vernon, a large, beefy man with very little neck and a lot of mustache. Far from wishing Harry a happy birthday, none of the Dursleys made any sign that they had noticed Harry enter the room, but Harry was far too used to this to care. He helped himself to a piece of toast and then looked up at the reporter on the television, who was halfway through a report on an escaped convict:</div>

<div class="line_en">Aunt Marge was Uncle Vernon's sister. Even though she was not a blood relative of Harry's (whose mother had been Aunt Petunia's sister), he had been forced to call her "Aunt" all his life. Aunt Marge lived in the country, in a house with a large garden, where she bred bulldogs. She didn't often stay at Privet Drive, because she couldn't bear to leave her precious dogs, but each of her visits stood out horribly vividly in Harry's mind.</div>

<div class="line_en">At Dudley's fifth birthday party, Aunt Margo had whacked Harry around the shins with her walking stick to stop him from beating Dudley at musical statues. A few years later, she had turned up at Christmas with a computerized robot for Dudley and a box of dog biscuits for Harry. On her last visit, the year before Harry started at Hogwarts, Harry had accidentally trodden on the tail of her favorite dog. Ripper had chased Harry out into the garden and up a tree, and Aunt Marge had refused to call him off until past midnight. The memory of this incident still brought tears of laughter to Dudley's eyes.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“别，弗农。”玛姬姑妈打着嗝儿说，一面举起手来，她那双充血的小眼睛紧盯着哈利。“说下去，小子。为你的双亲骄傲，对吗？他们出门，遇到车祸，死了（我想，是喝醉了吧）——”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"MARGE!" yelled Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia together as Aunt Marge's whole body began to rise off her chair toward the ceiling. She was entirely round, now, like a vast life buoy with piggy eyes, and her hands and feet stuck out weirdly as she drifted up into the air, making apoplectic popping noises. Ripper came skidding into the room, barking madly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“玛姬！”弗农姨父和佩妮姨妈一起大叫道，此时玛姬姑妈的整个身体开始离开她的座椅，向天花板升去。现在她完全是圆的了，她像个有一双小眼睛的救生圈一样，在她向空中飘浮的时候。她的双手和双脚古怪地伸着，发出一阵阵爆破声。利皮溜进房间，发疯似的吠叫着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But Aunt Marge suddenly stopped speaking. For a moment, it looked as though words had failed her. She seemed to be swelling with inexpressible anger -- but the swelling didn't stop. Her great red face started to expand, her tiny eyes bulged, and her mouth stretched too tightly for speech -- next second, several buttons had just burst from her tweed jacket and pinged off the walls -- she was inflating like a monstrous balloon, her stomach bursting free of her tweed waistband, each of her fingers blowing up like a salami --</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但玛姬姑妈突然住嘴不说了。有一会儿工夫，好像她张口结舌，说不出话来似的。她似乎由于没法形容的愤怒而膨胀开来了——但是这种膨胀并没有停止。她那张通红的大脸开始扩展，她那双小眼睛向外突出，她的嘴张得太大，没法说话。过了一秒钟，好几枚纽扣从她的花呢衣服上进了下来，砰砰地撞在墙上——她膨胀着，活像一只大得吓人的气球，她的肚子胀得挣开了那根花呢腰带，她的每一根手指都胀得像香肠那样粗…">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Uncle Vernon seized one of Marge's feet and tried to pull her down again, but was almost lifted from the floor himself. A second later, Ripper leapt forward and sank his teeth into Uncle Vernon's leg.</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry tore from the dining room before anyone could stop him, heading for the cupboard under the stairs. The cupboard door burst magically open as he reached it. In seconds, he had heaved his trunk to the front door. He sprinted upstairs and threw himself under the bed, wrenching up the loose floorboard, and grabbed the pillowcase full of his books and birthday presents. He wriggled out, seized Hedwig's empty cage, and dashed back downstairs to his trunk, just as Uncle Vernon burst out of the dining room, his trouser leg in bloody tatters.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在还未来得及阻止哈利以前，哈利就离开了这个房间，冲向楼梯下面的那个碗柜。他走到那里去的时候，碗柜的门神秘地打开了。几秒钟之内，他已经用力举起他的衣箱放到了大门口。他全速奔跑上楼，一头钻到床下，猛然掀开那块松动的地板，抓出那个装满了他的书和生日礼物的枕套。他扭动着身子从床底下退出来，一把抓住海德薇的空笼子，冲下楼梯奔向他的衣箱，这时弗农姨父正好从餐室出来。他的裤腿成了破破烂烂的布条。">查看中文翻译</div>
