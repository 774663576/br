<div class="line_en">"We are all at risk," she told him, perhaps too sharply. "Do you think I wish to be here, ser?" I belong at Riverrun with my dying father, at Winterfell with my sons. "Robb sent me south to speak for him, and speak for him I shall." It would be no easy thing to forge a peace between these brothers, Catelyn knew, yet for the good of the realm, it must be tried.</div>

<div class="line_en">Stannis Baratheon's foragers had cut the trees down for his siege towers and catapults. Catelyn wondered how long the grove had stood, and whether Ned had rested here when he led his host south to lift the last siege of Storm's End. He had won a great victory that day, all the greater for being bloodless.</div>

<div class="line_en">"We are the first, my lady," Hallis Mollen said as they reined up amidst the stumps, alone between the armies.

<div class="line_en">Across rain-sodden flelds and stony ridges, she could see the great castle of Storm's End rearing up against the sky, its back to the unseen sea. Beneath that mass of pale grey stone, the encircling army of Lord Stannis Baratheon looked as small and insignificant as mice with banners.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="越过细雨浸染的田野和多石崎岖的山冈，她遥遥望见巨大的风息堡屹立于苍天，完全遮蔽了其后的汪洋。在那些浅灰色的巨石下，史坦尼斯·拜拉席恩公爵的军队看起来如此渺小和无助，活像举着旗帜的老鼠。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The songs said that Storm's End had been raised in ancient days by Durran, the first Storm King, who had won the love of the fair Elenei, daughter of the sea god and the goddess of the wind. On the night of their wedding, Elenei had yielded her maidenhood to a mortal's love and thus doomed herself to a mortal's death, and her grieving parents had unleashed their wrath and sent the winds and waters to batter down Durran's hold. His friends and brothers and wedding guests were crushed beneath collapsing walls or blown out to sea, but Elenei sheltered Durran within her arms so he took no harm, and when the dawn came at last he declared war upon the gods and vowed to rebuild.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="歌谣相传，风息堡乃是古代第一位风暴国王杜伦所建，他赢得了美丽的依妮的爱情，而她是海神和风之女神爱的结晶。在他们新婚之夜，依妮将她的贞洁献给了一位凡人，从此便须像凡人一样承受生老病死。她的双亲对女儿的决定悲愤无比，将怒火发泄于杜伦的城郭。他们招来狂风和巨浪。那一夜，他的朋友、兄弟和婚宴宾客统统被卷走，要么砸死在城墙，要么淹没于汪洋，只有依妮用她的双臂勇敢地护卫着杜伦，保护他免遭伤害。最后，天亮了，风暴终于停息，这时杜伦向神灵们宣战，他发誓要重建城堡。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Five more castles he built, each larger and stronger than the last, only to see them smashed asunder when the gale winds came howling up Shipbreaker Bay, driving great walls of water before them. His lords pleaded with him to build inland; his priests told him he must placate the gods by giving Elenei back to the sea; even his smallfolk begged him to relent. Durran would have none of it. A seventh castle he raised, most massive of all. Some said the children of the forest helped him build it, shaping the stones with magic; others claimed that a small boy told him what he must do, a boy who would grow to be Bran the Builder. No matter how the tale was told, the end was the same. Though the angry gods threw storm after storm against it, the seventh castle stood defiant, and Durran Godsgrief and fair Elenei dwelt there together until the end of their days.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的城堡重建了五次，一次比一次高大，一次比一次坚固，但当那呼啸的狂风和滔天的巨浪从破船湾中咆哮而出时，城墙都被一一粉碎。他的封臣纷纷恳求他迁到内地筑城；他的牧师告诉他为了安抚神灵的怒气应把依妮归还于大海；甚至他的属民百姓也请求他别再斗争。杜伦通通置之不理。他终于建成了第七座城堡，最雄伟的城堡。传说中这座城堡乃是由森林之子帮助修建，巨石中充溢着他们的魔法；另一种说法是城堡的筑法得自于一位小男孩之口——这个孩子就是日后的筑城者布兰登。不过无论故事的说法怎样，结局总是相同：尽管愤怒的神灵一次又一次将风暴投掷到那第七座城堡，它依旧巍然耸立，被神憎恨的杜伦和美丽的依妮幸福地生活在一起，直到他们终归尘土。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Gods do not forget, and still the gales came raging up the narrow sea. Yet Storm's End endured, through centuries and tens of centuries, a castle like no other. Its great curtain wall was a hundred feet high, unbroken by arrow slit or postern, everywhere rounded, curving, smooth, its stones fit so cunningly together that nowhere was crevice nor angle nor gap by which the wind might enter. That wall was said to be forty feet thick at its narrowest, and near eighty on the seaward face, a double course of stones with an inner core of sand and rubble. Within that mighty bulwark, the kitchens and stables and yards sheltered safe from wind and wave. Of towers, there was but one, a colossal drum tower, windowless where it faced the sea, so large that it was granary and barracks and feast hall and lord's dwelling all in one, crowned by massive battlements that made it look from afar like a spiked flst atop an upthrust arm.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="神灵没有宽恕他，千钧的狂风依旧时时从狭海吹来。风息堡日复一日地承受着风暴，几个纪元几十个世纪转瞬而过，而这城堡纹丝不动。它那伟岸的外墙足足有百尺之高，其上既无箭孔亦无暗门，巨石之间镶嵌精巧，处处浑圆一体，弯曲平滑，无角无缝，风雨难侵。外墙最窄的地方据说是四十尺厚，而临海一面将近有八十尺，城墙由内外两层巨石夹着中间的沙砾和碎石。在这伟岸的城墙之内，不论厨房、马厩还是庭院都不会受到一丝一毫风暴和波涛的影响。至于塔楼，这座城只有独一无二的一座，一座巨型的钟鼓楼。它临海的一面无有窗户，整个塔把风息堡的谷仓、兵营、宴会厅以及贵族居所都装在里面，令人惊叹于它的庞大。厚实的城垛环绕着它的顶部，远远看去，犹如一只擎天巨臂上张开的无数手指。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Renly would be last to arrive. He had told her as much when she set out. He did not propose to mount his horse until he saw his brother well on his way. The first to arrive must wait on the other, and Renly would do no waiting. It is a sort of game kings play, she told herself. Well, she was no king, so she need not play it. Catelyn was practiced at waiting.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="蓝礼铁定会最后到来。她动身前他便告知她：他要等老哥出发后才会上马，因为早到的将等待晚到的，而他蓝礼决不当那个等待者。这是国王之间玩的又一种游戏，她告诉自己。好在她自己不是国王，所以她可以摆脱这些游戏。而对于等待，凯特琳早已习以为常。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No doubt." Catelyn watched them come. Stannis it must be, yet that is not the Baratheon banner. It was a bright yellow, not the rich gold of Renly's standards, and the device it bore was red, though she could not make out its shape.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不错。”凯特琳打量着他们。那肯定是史坦尼斯，不过旗号却不是拜拉席恩家族的徽章。那是嫩黄，而非蓝礼营中的金黄，尤其是上面的图案，似乎是红的，凯特琳看不清它的形状。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As he neared, she saw that Stannis wore a crown of red gold with points fashioned in the shape of flames. His belt was studded with garnets and yellow topaz, and a great square-cut ruby was set in the hilt of the sword he wore. Otherwise his dress was plain: studded leather jerkin over quilted doublet, worn boots, breeches of brown roughspun. The device on his sun-yellow banner showed a red heart surrounded by a blaze of orange fire. The crowned stag was there, yes… shrunken and enclosed within the heart. Even more curious was his standard bearer -- a woman, garbed all in reds, face shadowed within the deep hood of her scarlet cloak. A red priestess, Catelyn thought, wondering. The sect was numerous and powerful in the Free Cities and the distant east, but there were few in the Seven Kingdoms.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="直等他走近，她才看清史坦尼斯戴着一顶赤金的王冠，边缘刻意弄成火焰的形状。他的腰带上镶着石榴石和黄玉，一颗四四方方的大红宝石嵌在他的佩剑柄上。他身上的其他装束却很朴素：棉上衣外罩镶钉皮背心，一双磨旧的靴子，织工粗糙的棕色马裤。他那艳阳般色泽的旗帜上，画了一颗火红之心，由一圈橙色火焰所环绕。宝冠雄鹿的标记也还在上面，还在…不过却大大缩小，并被勾勒在火心之中。更奇怪的是，他挑选的掌旗官不仅是个女的，还一身火红装束，面容隐藏在猩红色的兜帽里不得而知。似乎是域外的红袍女祭司，凯特琳好奇地想。这个教派分支繁多，根深叶茂，不过一直都在自由贸易城邦和遥远的东方活动，向来不大涉足七大王国。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Your Grace, I see no need for battle here," Lord Mathis Rowan put in. "The castle is strongly garrisoned and well provisioned, Ser Cortnay Penrose is a seasoned commander, and the trebuchet has not been built that could breach the walls of Storm's End. Let Lord Stannis have his siege. He will find no joy in it, and whilst he sits cold and hungry and profitless, we will take King's Landing."</div>

"My brother has not changed," their young king told them as Brienne unfastened his cloak and lifted the gold-and-jade crown from his brow. "Castles and courtesies will not appease him, he must have blood. Well, I am of a mind to grant his wish."</div>
