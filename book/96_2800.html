<div class="line_en">The dog-man curled up heavily on Sophie's toes when she went back to her sewing. Perhaps he was hoping she would manage to lift the spell if he stayed close to her. When a big, red-bearded man burst into the room, carrying a box of things, and shed his velvet cloak to become Michael, still carrying a box of things, the man-dog rose up and wagged his tail. He let Michael pat him and rub his ears.</div>

<div class="line_en">Howl heard Michael's voice. He arrived downstairs wrapped in the brown patchwork cover off his bed. Sophie stopped sewing and took a careful grip on the dog.

<div class="line_en">So Fanny is selling the shop, Sophie thought as the other three went on discussing the move. And so much for the conscience Howl said he had! But the main thing on her mind was the puzzling behavior of the dog. In spite of Sophie telling him many times that she could not take the spell of him, he did not seem to want to leave. He did not want to bite Howl. He let Michael take him for a run on the Porthaven Marshes that night and the following morning. His aim seemed to be to become part of the household.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="芬妮要把店卖掉？当他们三人继续讨论搬家事宜时，苏菲想着。而哈尔所谓的良心亦不过而而。但是最令她感到困惑的，是这只狗的行为。虽然苏菲跟它说过许多次，她无法帮它解除咒语，它还是无意离开。它也不想咬哈尔。当晚以及次日早晨，它都让麦可带它去避难港的沼泽地跑步，它的目的似乎在成为这个家族的成员之一。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Though if I were you, I'd be in Upper Folding making sure to catch Lettie on the rebound," Sophie told him.</div>

<div class="line_en">Howl sat on a tall stool like a robed Roman senator and considered. "It depends on how much it costs," he said. "I'm tempted to move the Porthaven entrance there.

<div class="line_en">Howl was in and out of bed all the next day. When he was in bed, Michael had to tear up and down the stairs. When he was up, Michael had to race about, measuring the castle with him and fixing metal brackets to every single corner.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天，哈尔一会起身，一会躺着。当他躺下时，麦可就忙着楼上楼下两头跑。当他起床时，麦可则四处跑，跟着他丈量城堡并且用金属托架固定每一个角落。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Next time he reappeared, he was dressed. That made three times that day, and Sophie thought nothing of it until Howl put on the velvet cloak Michael had used and became a pale, coughing, red-bearded man with a large red handkerchief held to his nose. She realized Howl was going out then. "You'll make your cold worse," she said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="等他再度出现时，他已穿着整齐。那天这已是第三次了，因此苏菲起先不以为意。但是接着，他却披上麦可曾穿过的那件丝绒斗篷，变成一个苍白、咳嗽着的红胡子，手里拿着一块红色的大手帕正在擦鼻子。她这才知道他打算要出门，忍不住说：“这样感冒会恶化的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For an hour after that, Michael had time to work on his spell. Sophie got as far as her eighty-fourth blue triangle. Then the red-bearded man was back again. He shed the velvet cloak and became Howl, coughing harder than before and, if that was possible, more sorry for himself than ever.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接下来的一小时，麦可有时间弄他的符咒，苏菲则一直缝到第八十个蓝色三角形。然后，红胡子男人回来了。脱下斗篷，又变回哈尔，咳得比未出门前严重，而且，还真服了他了！居然可以比以前还自怜。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I took the shop," he told Michael. "It's got a useful shed at the back and a house at the side, and I took the lot. I'm not sure what I shall pay for it all with, though."</div>

<div class="line_en">Michael came cheerfully down and worked on his spell. He was so happy that he was joining in Calcifer's saucepan song and chatting to the skull just as Sophie did, wile he worked. "We're going to live in Market Chipping," he told the skull. ""I can go and see my Lettie every day."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="麦可高高兴兴地下楼，又开始弄他的咒语。因为非常高兴，他边工作边加入卡西法的炖锅歌，并且学着苏菲跟骷髅说话。“我们要搬去马克奇平了，”他跟骷髅说：“我可以每天都去看我的小乐蒂了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Michael had to leave the spell and rush upstairs. Sophie might have gone, except the dog-man got in the way when she tried. This was another part of his odd behavior.

<div class="line_cn" title="麦可只好赶快放下咒语跑上楼，苏菲本来也要去的，但是狗人把她挡住，这是它另一个奇怪的行为。它不喜欢苏菲为哈尔做任何事，苏菲觉得这很合理，于是坐下来缝第八十五个三角形。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你忘了。”哈尔沙哑地说：“我们做这些的目的，就是为了不去找贾斯丁王子。我们要凭空消失！”说完他就咳着上楼、上床，然后过不了多久，就开始为了引人注意而大声打喷嚏，弄得屋梁都震动起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He was interrupted by Howl, trailing downstairs in his quilt again. "This is positively my last appearance," Howl croaked. "I forgot to say that Mrs. Pentstemmon is being buried tomorrow on her estate near Porthaven and I shall need this suit cleaned." He brought the gray-and-scarlet suit out from inside his coverlet and dropped it on Sophie's lap. "You're attending to the wrong suit," he told Sophie. "This is the one I like, but I haven't the energy to clean it myself."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的话被哈尔打断，哈尔身上仍披着那件拼布被单。“这肯定是我最后一次下来，”他说：“我忘了告诉你们，潘思德曼太太明天下葬，地点就在她靠近避难港的私人土地。我这件衣服需要清洗。”他把灰色及暗红色的衣服由被单里拿出来，丢在苏菲腿上。“你把时间花错对象了。我喜欢的是这一件，但是我没有力气自己清洗。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="哈尔马上装出最高尚、无辜的表情。“我会没事的。”他哑声说：“只要记得避开海风就好了。潘思德曼那片地产位于受风地带。树全被吹得歪一边长，连绵几哩都没有避风雨的地方。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Then you need a winding sheet and not this suit," Sophie called after him. Howl trailed away upstairs without answering and Sophie did not protest. She now had the charmed suit in her hands and it was too good a chance to miss. She took up her scissors and hacked the gray-and-scarlet suit into seven jagged pieces. That ought to discourage Howl from wearing it. Then she got to work on the last triangles of the blue-and-silver suit, mostly little fragments from round the neck. It was now very small indeed. It looked as if might be a size too small even for Mrs. Pentstemmon's page boy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那你根本不需要这件衣服！你需要的是裹尸布。”苏菲在他身后叫道。哈尔没有回答，继续拖着脚步往楼上走，苏菲也没有再抗议。她手里抓着那件有迷咒的衣服，真是机不可失！她拿起剪刀，一口气将这件灰、红色的衣服剪成七块，这下子，哈尔就不会再想要穿它了。然后她回头把最后几个三角形缝到银、蓝色衣服上，这些都是领口的部分。衣服现在变得好小，就是给潘思德曼太太的侍童穿，都嫌小一个尺码。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“这里。”苏菲剪断最后一根线，将睡着的狗人推到一边，然后将那件只剩儿童尺码的衣服小心地搁在地上。麦可同样小心地将碗倾斜，在衣服的每一寸撒上绿粉。">查看中文翻译</div>

He looked noble and sad in his sleep.

<div class="line_en">"Snooping again," Howl said suddenly behind her. Sophie swung round guiltily, to find that Howl was only half awake really. He may have even thought it was the day before, because he said, " 'Teach me to keep off envy's stinging' -- that's all part of past years now. I love Wales, but it doesn't love me. Megan's full of envy because she's respectable and I'm not." Then he woke up a little more and asked, "What are you doing?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“又在多管闲事了。”哈尔突然在她后面说话。苏菲带着罪恶感快速地转过身来，却发现哈尔其实处在半睡半醒状态。他的思绪仍停留在前天，因为他说：“教我免叫嫉妒刺伤的方法，那都已经是过去的事了。我爱威尔斯，但威尔斯不爱我。梅根就是充满了嫉妒，因为她受人尊敬，而我不是。”然后他稍稍再清醒些，问道：“你在干吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The sun was low across the neat garden. A large, dark man was out there, enthusiastically throwing a red ball towards Howl's nephew, Neil, who was standing with a look of patient suffering, holding a bat. Sophie could see the man was Neil's father.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="太阳低低垂挂在那整洁的花园上头。一个高大、深色皮肤的男子站在那儿，兴冲冲地投掷一颗红色的球给哈尔的外甥尼尔，尼尔脸上写着痛苦的忍耐。苏菲看得出那人是尼尔的父亲。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Howl must have gone back to sleep. He did not emerge again that night. There was no sign of him stirring when Sophie and Michael got up next morning. They were careful not to disturb him. Neither of them felt that going to Mrs. Pentstemmon's funeral was a good idea. Michael crept out onto the hills to take the dog-man for a run. Sophie tiptoed about, getting breakfast, hoping Howl would oversleep. There was still no sign of Howl when Michael came back. The dog-man was starving hungry. Sophie and Michael were hunting in the closet for things a dog could eat when they heard Howl coming slowly down the stairs.</div>

<div class="line_en">He was standing holding the door to the stair open with an arm that was entirely hidden in an immense blue-and-silver sleeve. His feet, on the bottom stair, were standing inside the top half of a gigantic blue-and-silver jacket. Howl's other arm did not come anywhere near the other huge sleeve. Sophie could see that arm in outline. Making bulging gestures under a vast frill collar. Behind Howl, the stairs were full of blue-and-silver suit trailing back all the way to his bedroom.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="楼梯的门开着，哈尔一手扶着那门，整只手都藏在一个巨大无比的蓝、银色袖子里。他的脚在楼梯的底阶，被套在一件居然无比的蓝、银色上衣的上半部里。另一只手则离另一只巨大的袖子十分遥远。苏菲可以看到那只手的轮廓，在一个很大的，有皱褶的领子下鼓动着做手势。他身后的楼梯则盖满蓝、银色的套装。一路拖拽到他的卧室里面。">查看中文翻译</div>

Howl, with a bit of searching, succeeded in finding his hand inside the multiple folds of blue-and-silver sleeve and working it through a gap between two tremendous stitches. He grabbed the bundle off her. "I am now," he said, "going to get ready for the funeral. Please, both of you, refrain from doing anything whatsoever while I do.

<div class="line_en">He set off with dignity to the bathroom, wading in blue-and-silver suit. The rest of the blue-and-silver suit followed him, dragging step by step down the stairs and rustling across the floor. By the time Howl was in the bathroom, most of the jacket was on the ground floor and the trousers were appearing on the stairs. Howl half-shut the bathroom door and seemed to go on hauling the suit in hand over hand. Sophie and Michael and the dog-man stood and watched yard after yard of blue or silver fabric proceed across the floor, decorated with an occasional silver button the size of a millstone and enormous, regular, ropelike stitches. There may have been nearly a mile of it.</div>

<div class="line_en">He came forth two hours later, out of a steam of verbena-scented spells. He was all in black. His suit was black, his boots were black, and his hair was black, the same blue-raven black as Miss Angorian's. His earring was a long jet pendant. Sophie wondered if the black hair was in honor of Mrs. Pentstemmon. She agreed with Mrs. Pentstemmon that black hair suited Howl. His green-glass eyes went better with it. But she wondered very much which suit the black one really was.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两小时后，哈尔由充满马鞭草香味的蒸汽中现身，全身黑色：黑色套装、黑色靴子，甚至连头发都是黑的，像安歌丽雅小姐那种蓝黑色。还有，长长的耳环也是黑的。苏菲猜想他那头黑发是为了对潘思德曼太太致敬才改的。她同意潘思德曼太太所说——黑发比较适合哈尔。他绿色玻璃珠似的眼睛跟黑发比较搭配，不过她不确定那套黑衣服到底是由哪一套变来的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Howl conjured himself a black tissue and blew his nose on it. The window rattled. He picked up one of the slices of bread and honey from the bench and beckoned the dog-man. The dog-man looked dubious. "I only want you where I can look at you," Howl croaked. His cold was still bad. "Come here, pooch." As the dog crawled reluctantly into the middle of the room, Howl added, "You won't find my other suit in the bathroom, Mrs. Snoop. You're not getting your hands on any of my clothes again."</div>

<div class="line_en">"What do you think of this as a disguise?" he said. He flicked the black tissue at Calcifer and started to fall forward onto hands and knees. Almost as he started to move, he was gone. By the time he touched the floor, he was a curly red setter, just like the dog-man.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“拿这个当伪装怎么样？”说完，哈尔就将黑色纸巾弹给卡西法，然后向前趴，双手及膝盖往地板上搭。他才一开始动，人就不见了，等他碰到地板时，已经变成一只有红色卷毛的雪达猎犬了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The dog-man was taken completely by surprise and his instincts got the better of him. His hackles came up, his ears lowered, and he growled. Howl played up -- or else he felt the same. The two identical dogs walked round one another, glaring, growling, bristling, and getting ready to fight.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Good," said Howl. "If I can deceive another dog, I can fool everyone else. No one at the funeral is going to notice a stray dog lifting its leg against the gravestones." He went to the door and turned the knob blue-down.</div>
