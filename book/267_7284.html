<div class="line_en">For two long years I lived the life of a slave. I worked in escape, but it was never possible. I thought about it day and night. My master liked to go fishing in a little boat, and he always took me with him. A man called Moely, and a young boy also went with us.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两年多的时间里，我过着奴隶的生活，每天都计划着逃跑，但一直没能成功。我日夜思考着逃跑的事。我的主人喜欢乘小船去钓鱼，而且总是带上我。一个名叫莫雷的男人及一个小男孩也总跟随着我们。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">My master went back to his friends and we took the boat out to sea. For a time we fished quietly, and then I moved carefully behind Moely and knocked him into the water. "Swim!" I cried. "Swim to the shore!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="主人回到他的朋友们那儿去了，我们坐船出了海。静静地钓了一阵鱼，然后我小心翼翼地移到莫雷的身后把他推到了海里。“游回去，”我大声喊着“朝岸上游！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Go back to the shore! You can swim there it's not too far. I won't hurt you, but if you come near the boat, I'll shoot you through the head!" So Moely turned, and swam back to the shore as quickly as he could.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“回到岸上去！你可以游到那儿，这儿离海岸不太远。我不会伤害你，但如果你一靠近这只船，我就会打穿你的睑袋！”于是，莫雷转过身尽他最快的速度游回岸上去了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For about ten or twelve days we sailed on south, down the coast of Africa. Then one day we saw some people on the shore -- strange, wild people, who did not look friendly. By now we had very little food, and We really needed help. we were afraid, but we had to go on shore.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="沿着非洲海岸我们朝南航行了大约10天至12天，随后一天我们看到岸上有些人——古怪的野人，他们看起来并不友善，那时我们的食物很少了，我们实在需要帮助，我们害怕，但我们不得不上岸。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I wanted to sail to the Canary Islands, but I was afraid to go too far from the shore. It was only a small boat. And so we sailed on south for some days. We had very little water, and it was dangerous country here, with many wild animals. We were afraid, but we often had to go on shore to get more water. Once I used a gun to shoot a wild animal. I don't know what animal it was, but it made a good meal.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我想驶向加纳利岛，但是不敢远离海岸，这只是一只小船。因此我们向南航行了几天，我们只有很少的水，这儿是危险的国度，有许多野生动物。我们害怕，但是我们常常不得不上岸去取水，有一次我用枪射死了一只野兽，我不知道这是什么动物，但它成了一顿美餐。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Just then two big wild cats came down to the shore from the mountains. I think they were leopards. The people were afraid of these wild cats, and the women cried out. Quickly, I took a gun, and shot one of the animals. The second wild cat ran back up into the mountains.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="正在这时候，两只大野猫从山上窜到海边来。我想它们是豹子。那些人们害怕这些野猫，那些妇女们尖叫起来。很快地，我拿起一枝枪，击中了其中一只野兽。另外一只跑回了山里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At first, they were afraid of us, too. Perhaps white people never visited this coast. We did not speak their language, of course, so we used our hands and faces to show that we were hungry. They came with food for us, but then they moved away quickly. We carried the food to our boat, and they watched us. I tried to thank them, but I had nothing to give them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="开始，他们也害怕我们。或许白人从没有访问过这海岸。当然，我们不会说他们的语言，我们只好用手势和脸部表情来表明我们很饿。他们把食物搬给我们，随即迅速地离开。我们把食物搬上船，他们瞧着我们。我试图感谢他们，却没有什么东西可以送给他们。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Guns were new to these African people, and they were afraid of the loud noise and the smoke. But they were happy about the dead wild cat. I gave them the meat of the dead animal, and they gave us more food and water.</div>

<div class="line_en">But he gave me money for my boat, and for Xury, too. At first, I did not want to sell Xury as a slave, after all our dangerous adventures together. But Xury was happy to go to the captain, and the captain was a good man. "In ten years time," he said, "Xury can go free."</div>
