<div class="line_en">Lucy came running full tilt downstairs, having just nipped in to the drawing-room to smooth a cover, to straighten a chair, to pause a moment and feel whoever came in must think how clean, how bright, how beautifully cared for, when they saw the beautiful silver, the brass fire-irons, the new chair-covers, and the curtains of yellow chintz: she appraised each; heard a roar of voices; people already coming up from dinner; she must fly!</div>

<div class="line_en">The Prime Minister was coming, Agnes said: so she had heard them say in the dining-room, she said, coming in with a tray of glasses. Did it matter, did it matter in the least, one Prime Minister more or less? It made no difference at this hour of the night to Mrs. Walker among the plates, saucepans, cullenders, frying-pans, chicken in aspic, ice-cream freezers, pared crusts of bread, lemons, soup tureens, and pudding basins which, however hard they washed up in the scullery seemed to be all on top of her, on the kitchen table, on chairs, while the fire blared and roared, the electric lights glared, and still supper had to be laid. All she felt was, one Prime Minister more or less made not a scrap of difference to Mrs. Walker.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was borne through the kitchen. Over her shoulder Lucy reported how Miss Elizabeth looked quite lovely; she couldn't take her eyes off her; in her pink dress, wearing the necklace Mr. Dalloway had given her. Jenny must remember the dog, Miss Elizabeth's fox- terrier, which, since it bit, had to be shut up and might, Elizabeth thought, want something. Jenny must remember the dog. But Jenny was not going upstairs with all those people about. There was a motor at the door already! There was a ring at the bell -- and the gentlemen still in the dining-room, drinking tokay!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="葡萄酒从厨房端了出去。露西回过头去汇报说，伊丽莎白小姐看上去多可爱呀，穿着粉色的裙子，戴着达洛维先生给她的项链，使自己忍不住一个劲地盯着她瞧。不过，詹妮一定要记得那条狗，伊丽莎白的那条猎狐犬，因为它咬人，不得不关了禁闭，伊丽莎白想道，也许它需要点吃的。詹妮一定要记得照料那条狗哟。然而，詹妮是不会和那些四处转悠的人们一起上楼来的。门口已经停了辆汽车！门铃响了起来——先生们还待在餐厅里，喝着芳香葡萄酒呢！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The ladies were going upstairs already, said Lucy; the ladies were going up, one by one, Mrs. Dalloway walking last and almost always sending back some message to the kitchen, "My love to Mrs. Walker," that was it one night. Next morning they would go over the dishes -- the soup, the salmon; the salmon, Mrs. Walker knew, as usual underdone, for she always got nervous about the pudding and left it to Jenny; so it happened, the salmon was always underdone. But some lady with fair hair and silver ornaments had said, Lucy said, about the entrée, was it really made at home? But it was the salmon that bothered Mrs. Walker, as she spun the plates round and round, and pulled in dampers and pulled out dampers; and there came a burst of laughter from the dining-room; a voice speaking; then another burst of laughter -- the gentlemen enjoying themselves when the ladies had gone. The tokay, said Lucy running in. Mr. Dalloway had sent for the tokay, from the Emperor's cellars, the Imperial Tokay.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="女士们正在上楼来，露西说。女士们上来了，一个接一个，达洛维夫人走在最后头，几乎一直在往厨房间里传话，“向沃尔克太太表达我的谢意。”整晚上就这么一句话。等到第二天早上，她们会一起回味昨晚的菜肴——汤，三文鱼，等等。三文鱼，沃尔克太太知道，肯定像往常一样，是半生不熟的，因为她老是担心布丁，就把三文鱼交给詹妮处理了，所以结果就是这样，三文鱼总是烧得半生不熟的。不过，有位金头发、银首饰的女士还问了，露西说，那道正菜间的小菜，真的是自家做的吗？可是，三文鱼的问题依旧令沃尔克太太苦恼，她手里拿着盘子不停地转着擦洗，把风门一会儿关上一会儿打开。从餐厅那里传来一阵大笑，一个说话的声音，然后又是一阵大笑——女士们退场后，先生们开始自娱自乐啦。芳香葡萄酒，露西跑进来说，达洛维先生派人去拿芳香葡萄酒了，是帝王酒窖的皇家葡萄酒呢。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There, they were going upstairs; that was the first to come, and now they would come faster and faster, so that Mrs. Parkinson (hired for parties) would leave the hall door ajar, and the hall would be full of gentlemen waiting (they stood waiting, sleeking down their hair) while the ladies took their cloaks off in the room along the passage; where Mrs. Barnet helped them, old Ellen Barnet, who had been with the family for forty years, and came every summer to help the ladies, and remembered mothers when they were girls, and though very unassuming did shake hands; said "milady" very respectfully, yet had a humorous way with her, looking at the young ladies, and ever so tactfully helping Lady Lovejoy, who had some trouble with her underbodice. And they could not help feeling, Lady Lovejoy and Miss Alice, that some little privilege in the matter of brush and comb, was awarded them having known Mrs. Barnet --"thirty years, milady," Mrs. Barnet supplied her. Young ladies did not use to rouge, said Lady Lovejoy, when they stayed at Bourton in the old days. And Miss Alice didn't need rouge, said Mrs. Barnet, looking at her fondly. There Mrs. Barnet would sit, in the cloakroom, patting down the furs, smoothing out the Spanish shawls, tidying the dressing-table, and knowing perfectly well, in spite of the furs and the embroideries, which were nice ladies, which were not. The dear old body, said Lady Lovejoy, mounting the stairs, Clarissa's old nurse.</div>

<div class="line_en">Oh dear, it was going to be a failure; a complete failure, Clarissa felt it in her bones as dear old Lord Lexham stood there apologising for his wife who had caught cold at the Buckingham Palace garden party. She could see Peter out of the tail of her eye, criticising her, there, in that corner. Why, after all, did she do these things? Why seek pinnacles and stand drenched in fire? Might it consume her anyhow! Burn her to cinders! Better anything, better brandish one's torch and hurl it to earth than taper and dwindle away like some Ellie Henderson! It was extraordinary how Peter put her into these states just by coming and standing in a corner. He made her see herself; exaggerate. It was idiotic. But why did he come, then, merely to criticise? Why always take, never give? Why not risk one's one little point of view? There he was wandering off, and she must speak to him. But she would not get the chance. Life was that -- humiliation, renunciation. What Lord Lexham was saying was that his wife would not wear her furs at the garden party because "my dear, you ladies are all alike"-- Lady Lexham being seventy-five at least! It was delicious, how they petted each other, that old couple. She did like old Lord Lexham. She did think it mattered, her party, and it made her feel quite sick to know that it was all going wrong, all falling flat. Anything, any explosion, any horror was better than people wandering aimlessly, standing in a bunch at a corner like Ellie Henderson, not even caring to hold themselves upright.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哦，老天，这场派对肯定会失败的，彻底地失败，当莱克斯汉姆老勋爵站在她面前，为妻子在白金汉宫的花园会上着凉了一事道歉时，克拉丽莎打骨子里这么感觉。她用眼角的余光扫到了彼德，看见他站在一个角落里，露出了批评的神色。究竟是为了什么，她要举办这场派对呢？为什么不惜身陷火海也要去追求巅峰呢？反正，让火焰把她吞噬掉好了！把她烧成灰烬！什么都好，就是挥舞起火把再将它扔到地上，也总比像埃莉·亨德森那样浑浑噩噩、渐渐凋零要好呀！彼德真是太了不起了，他只要到这里来一下，只要在角落里站一下，就能把她抛入这样的精神状态。他使她看清了自己：夸夸其谈、俗不可耐。可他为什么要来呢，只是为了来批评她的吗？他为什么只知道夺取，从不付出呢？为什么不冒险试一试讲明自己的小小观点呢？他好像要开溜的样子，她必须去和他说说话。可她找不到机会。生活就是那样的——羞辱、隐忍。莱克斯汉姆勋爵解释说，他妻子从来不会穿着毛皮大衣去参加花园会的，因为“亲爱的，你们这些女士都这样”——莱克斯汉姆太太至少也有七十五岁了！多妙呀，他们依旧这般恩爱，这对老夫妻。她确实喜欢莱克斯汉姆老勋爵。她确实认为她的派对很重要，所以觉察到一切都不对头，一切都陷入了平庸无聊，心里觉得很难受。无论发生什么事，爆炸也好，恐怖也好，都比人们在那里无目的地荡来荡去强，都比一帮子人懒懒地站在角落里，像埃莉·亨德森那样，甚至连自己的站相都不在乎要强。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"How delightful to see you!" said Clarissa. She said it to every one. How delightful to see you! She was at her worst -- effusive, insincere. It was a great mistake to have come.

<div class="line_cn" title="“见到您多高兴啊！”克拉丽莎说。她对谁都这么说。见到您多高兴啊！这是她最糟糕的表演——夸张、虚伪。来参加派对真是犯了个大错。还不如待在家里看看书呢，彼德·沃尔什想，应该去音乐厅的，或者待在家里的，因为这里他谁都不认识。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And then Lady Lovejoy stiffened. "Lady and Miss Lovejoy," she said to Mr. Wilkins (hired for parties). He had an admirable manner, as he bent and straightened himself, bent and straightened himself and announced with perfect impartiality "Lady and Miss Lovejoy… Sir John and Lady Needham… Miss Weld… Mr. Walsh." His manner was admirable; his family life must be irreproachable, except that it seemed impossible that a being with greenish lips and shaven cheeks could ever have blundered into the nuisance of children.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着，洛夫乔伊女士挺直了身躯。“洛夫乔伊夫人与小姐。”她对威尔金斯先生（他也是雇来在派对上帮忙的）说。威尔金斯先生的举止风度翩翩，你看他微微躬身再挺直，微微躬身再挺直起来，以不偏不倚的口吻通报说：“洛夫乔伊夫人与小姐…约翰爵士与尼达姆夫人…韦尔德小姐…沃尔什先生。”他的态度真好得没话说了，他的家庭生活也一定幸福美满。不过，只是很难想象这样一个嘴唇发青、下巴剃得干干净净的男人会鲁莽地陷进生儿育女这种麻烦事里去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Gently the yellow curtain with all the birds of Paradise blew out and it seemed as if there were a flight of wings into the room, right out, then sucked back. (For the windows were open.) Was it draughty, Ellie Henderson wondered? She was subject to chills. But it did not matter that she should come down sneezing to-morrow; it was the girls with their naked shoulders she thought of, being trained to think of others by an old father, an invalid, late vicar of Bourton, but he was dead now; and her chills never went to her chest, never. It was the girls she thought of, the young girls with their bare shoulders, she herself having always been a wisp of a creature, with her thin hair and meagre profile; though now, past fifty, there was beginning to shine through some mild beam, something purified into distinction by years of self-abnegation but obscured again, perpetually, by her distressing gentility, her panic fear, which arose from three hundred pounds' income, and her weaponless state (she could not earn a penny) and it made her timid, and more and more disqualified year by year to meet well- dressed people who did this sort of thing every night of the season, merely telling their maids "I'll wear so and so," whereas Ellie Henderson ran out nervously and bought cheap pink flowers, half a dozen, and then threw a shawl over her old black dress. For her invitation to Clarissa's party had come at the last moment. She was not quite happy about it. She had a sort of feeling that Clarissa had not meant to ask her this year.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="黄色窗帘及上面的每一只天堂鸟，都在温柔地舞动，感觉就像无数双翅膀飞进了房间，又立即飞了出去，最后又被吸了回来（因为窗户开着）。是穿堂风吗？埃莉·亨德森心想。她特别容易着凉。但即使她明天生病打喷嚏也没关系的，她担心的是那些裸露着肩膀的姑娘们，她的老父亲一向教导她要多为他人着想，她父亲是伯尔顿教区的前牧师长，身体一直不太好，如今已经去世。她的感冒从来也没有殃及肺部，一次也没有。她担心的是，那些裸着肩膀的姑娘们，而她本人一向是个弱不禁风的人，头发稀疏，身材瘦小。尽管如今她已五十出头，却有一道柔和的光芒开始从她的身上闪耀出来，它是多年来的克己为人净化出的一种卓越品质。但这样的光芒又会再次坠入混沌，永远的混沌，那是由于她那令人难受的繁文缛节，她那不知所措的恐惧感，那来自于她三百英镑的年收入，和她那无依无靠的处境（她连一个便士都挣不到），那造成了她的胆怯，年复一年地，她变得越来越不够格和那些衣着考究的贵人们共处一室。在这个季节的每一天晚上，那些贵人们都要忙于赴宴，她们只要吩咐仆人们“我要穿这件那件”就可以了，而埃莉·亨德森却要紧张兮兮地跑出去，买廉价的粉红花，买上半打，然后在她那条黑色的旧裙子上罩上条披巾。由于克拉丽莎是在最后一刻才给她发派对邀请函的，因此她觉得不太高兴。她有这么一种感觉，克拉丽莎今年本不打算邀请她的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So, with her weak eyesight, Ellie Henderson craned rather forward, and it wasn't so much she who minded not having any one to talk to (she hardly knew anybody there), for she felt that they were all such interesting people to watch; politicians presumably; Richard Dalloway's friends; but it was Richard himself who felt that he could not let the poor creature go on standing there all the evening by herself.</div>

<div class="line_en">Why should she? There was no reason really, except that they had always known each other. Indeed, they were cousins. But naturally they had rather drifted apart, Clarissa being so sought after. It was an event to her, going to a party. It was quite a treat just to see the lovely clothes. Wasn't that Elizabeth, grown up, with her hair done in the fashionable way, in the pink dress? Yet she could not be more than seventeen. She was very, very handsome. But girls when they first came out didn't seem to wear white as they used. (She must remember everything to tell Edith.) Girls wore straight frocks, perfectly tight, with skirts well above the ankles. It was not becoming, she thought.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克拉丽莎干吗一定要请她呢？真的没什么理由，她们不过是老相识罢了。实际上，她们是表姐妹。但由于克拉丽莎向来是个炙手可热的人物，她们也就自然而然地疏远了。不管怎么说，参加派对对她来说都是一件大事。只要看看那些可爱的服装，就能大饱眼福啊。那不是伊丽莎白吗，都长这么大了，梳着流行的发型，穿着粉红的裙子。不过，她顶多也就十七岁。她非常非常漂亮。但如今的女孩子初入社交界，已经不像以前那样穿白衣裙了（她要记住这里的一切，好回去告诉伊迪丝）。姑娘们穿直筒上衣，非常紧身，裙子的长度才到脚踝之上。太不得体了，她觉得。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And yet for her own part, it was too much of an effort. She was not enjoying it. It was too much like being -- just anybody, standing there; anybody could do it; yet this anybody she did a little admire, couldn't help feeling that she had, anyhow, made this happen, that it marked a stage, this post that she felt herself to have become, for oddly enough she had quite forgotten what she looked like, but felt herself a stake driven in at the top of her stairs. Every time she gave a party she had this feeling of being something not herself, and that every one was unreal in one way; much more real in another. It was, she thought, partly their clothes, partly being taken out of their ordinary ways, partly the background, it was possible to say things you couldn't say anyhow else, things that needed an effort; possible to go much deeper.

<div class="line_en">He looked always as if he were on duty, thought Peter, a privileged, but secretive being, hoarding secrets which he would die to defend, though it was only some little piece of tittle- tattle dropped by a court footman, which would be in all the papers tomorrow. Such were his rattles, his baubles, in playing with which he had grown white, come to the verge of old age, enjoying the respect and affection of all who had the privilege of knowing this type of the English public school man. Inevitably one made up things like that about Hugh; that was his style; the style of those admirable letters which Peter had read thousands of miles across the sea in the Times, and had thanked God he was out of that pernicious hubble-bubble if it were only to hear baboons chatter and coolies beat their wives. An olive-skinned youth from one of the Universities stood obsequiously by. Him he would patronise, initiate, teach how to get on. For he liked nothing better than doing kindnesses, making the hearts of old ladies palpitate with the joy of being thought of in their age, their affliction, thinking themselves quite forgotten, yet here was dear Hugh driving up and spending an hour talking of the past, remembering trifles, praising the home-made cake, though Hugh might eat cake with a Duchess any day of his life, and, to look at him, probably did spend a good deal of time in that agreeable occupation. The All- judging, the All-merciful, might excuse. Peter Walsh had no mercy. Villains there must be, and God knows the rascals who get hanged for battering the brains of a girl out in a train do less harm on the whole than Hugh Whitbread and his kindness. Look at him now, on tiptoe, dancing forward, bowing and scraping, as the Prime Minister and Lady Bruton emerged, intimating for all the world to see that he was privileged to say something, something private, to Lady Bruton as she passed. She stopped. She wagged her fine old head. She was thanking him presumably for some piece of servility. She had her toadies, minor officials in Government offices who ran about putting through little jobs on her behalf, in return for which she gave them luncheon. But she derived from the eighteenth century. She was all right.</div>

Lolloping on the waves and braiding her tresses she seemed, having that gift still; to be; to exist; to sum it all up in the moment as she passed; turned, caught her scarf in some other woman's dress, unhitched it, laughed, all with the most perfect ease and air of a creature floating in its element. But age had brushed her; even as a mermaid might behold in her glass the setting sun on some very clear evening over the waves. There was a breath of tenderness; her severity, her prudery, her woodenness were all warmed through now, and she had about her as she said good-bye to the thick gold- laced man who was doing his best, and good luck to him, to look important, an inexpressible dignity; an exquisite cordiality; as if she wished the whole world well, and must now, being on the very verge and rim of things, take her leave.

And, walking down the room with him, with Sally there and Peter there and Richard very pleased, with all those people rather inclined, perhaps, to envy, she had felt that intoxication of the moment, that dilatation of the nerves of the heart itself till it seemed to quiver, steeped, upright;-- yes, but after all it was what other people felt, that; for, though she loved it and felt it tingle and sting, still these semblances, these triumphs (dear old Peter, for example, thinking her so brilliant), had a hollowness; at arm's length they were, not in the heart; and it might be that she was growing old but they satisfied her no longer as they used; and suddenly, as she saw the Prime Minister go down the stairs, the gilt rim of the Sir Joshua picture of the little girl with a muff brought back Kilman with a rush; Kilman her enemy. That was satisfying; that was real. Ah, how she hated her -- hot, hypocritical, corrupt; with all that power; Elizabeth's seducer; the woman who had crept in to steal and defile (Richard would say, What nonsense!). She hated her: she loved her. It was enemies one wanted, not friends -- not Mrs. Durrant and Clara, Sir William and Lady Bradshaw, Miss Truelock and Eleanor Gibson (whom she saw coming upstairs).

He chaffed her about her party. He missed his brandy. These circles, he said, were above him. But he liked her; respected her, in spite of her damnable, difficult upper-class refinement, which made it impossible to ask Clarissa Dalloway to sit on his knee. And up came that wandering will-o'- the-wisp, that vagulous phosphorescence, old Mrs. Hilbery, stretching her hands to the blaze of his laughter (about the Duke and the Lady), which, as she heard it across the room, seemed to reassure her on a point which sometimes bothered her if she woke early in the morning and did not like to call her maid for a cup of tea; how it is certain we must die.</div>

<div class="line_en">Lady Bruton stood by Miss Parry's chair, a spectral grenadier, draped in black, inviting Peter Walsh to lunch; cordial; but without small talk, remembering nothing whatever about the flora or fauna of India. She had been there, of course; had stayed with three Viceroys; thought some of the Indian civilians uncommonly fine fellows; but what a tragedy it was -- the state of India! The Prime Minister had just been telling her (old Miss Parry huddled up in her shawl, did not care what the Prime Minister had just been telling her), and Lady Bruton would like to have Peter Walsh's opinion, he being fresh from the centre, and she would get Sir Sampson to meet him, for really it prevented her from sleeping at night, the folly of it, the wickedness she might say, being a soldier's daughter. She was an old woman now, not good for much. But her house, her servants, her good friend Milly Brush -- did he remember her?-- were all there only asking to be used if -- if they could be of help, in short. For she never spoke of England, but this isle of men, this dear, dear land, was in her blood (without reading Shakespeare), and if ever a woman could have worn the helmet and shot the arrow, could have led troops to attack, ruled with indomitable justice barbarian hordes and lain under a shield noseless in a church, or made a green grass mound on some primeval hillside, that woman was Millicent Bruton. Debarred by her sex and some truancy, too, of the logical faculty (she found it impossible to write a letter to the Times), she had the thought of Empire always at hand, and had acquired from her association with that armoured goddess her ramrod bearing, her robustness of demeanour, so that one could not figure her even in death parted from the earth or roaming territories over which, in some spiritual shape, the Union Jack had ceased to fly. To be not English even among the dead -- no, no! Impossible!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布鲁顿女士站在帕里小姐的椅子旁边，像个幽灵投弹手，穿着一袭黑衣，邀请彼德·沃尔什去参加她的午餐会。她很热情，但没有废话，对印度的花草鸟兽之类全无记忆。当然，她去过印度，曾在三位总督家住过，觉得有些印度平民实在是大好人。但印度的状况——真是惨不忍睹啊！首相刚刚告诉她的（老帕里小姐在披肩里缩成一团，首相说过什么她才不在意呢），而且，布鲁顿女士也很乐意听听彼德·沃尔什的意见，因为他刚从这个问题的核心过来，她会安排桑普森爵士和他见面的，因为那里的状况真的令她彻夜难眠。作为一个士兵的女儿，她觉得那里不仅是愚蠢，简直可说是邪恶。如今她年事已高，没有多大用处了。可她的房子，她的仆人，她的好朋友米莉·布拉什——他还记得吗？——都在那儿等着能派上用场呢——总之，只要他们能派上用场就好。虽然布鲁顿女士从来也不提起英国，但这座男人的岛屿，这片至亲至爱的土地，已经融入了她的血液里（虽然她没读过莎士比亚[74]）。如果天底下有一个女人会戴上头盔拉弓射箭，会指挥军队冲锋陷阵，用不屈不挠的正义感来统治蛮荒一族，最后被埋葬在教堂里平板的盾牌之下，或者被年代久远的某个山坡上的一堆青草掩埋，那女人就一定是米莉森特·布鲁顿。虽说她受到性别的限制，还缺乏严谨的逻辑思维（就连给《泰晤士报》写封信她都觉得力不从心），但她心里总惦记着大英帝国，因为受到了披盔戴甲的女神的感召，她获得了挺拔的身材和干练的作风，所以我们无法想象在她死后肉体会游离到尘世之外，或者以某种虚幻的形式，在大英国旗不再飘扬的国度里独自徘徊。哪怕是到了阴曹地府，要叫她不做英国人——不，不！绝对办不到！【注：[74]“这座男人的岛屿，这片至亲至爱的土地”等文字转引自莎士比亚的《理查二世》第二幕第四场。】">查看中文翻译</div>

But everybody forgave her. She stole a chicken from the larder because she was hungry in the night; she smoked cigars in her bedroom; she left a priceless book in the punt. But everybody adored her (except perhaps Papa). It was her warmth; her vitality -- she would paint, she would write. Old women in the village never to this day forgot to ask after "your friend in the red cloak who seemed so bright." She accused Hugh Whitbread, of all people (and there he was, her old friend Hugh, talking to the Portuguese Ambassador), of kissing her in the smoking-room to punish her for saying that women should have votes. Vulgar men did, she said. And Clarissa remembered having to persuade her not to denounce him at family prayers -- which she was capable of doing with her daring, her recklessness, her melodramatic love of being the centre of everything and creating scenes, and it was bound, Clarissa used to think, to end in some awful tragedy; her death; her martyrdom; instead of which she had married, quite unexpectedly, a bald man with a large buttonhole who owned, it was said, cotton mills at Manchester.

<div class="line_en">What business had the Bradshaws to talk of death at her party? A young man had killed himself. And they talked of it at her party -- the Bradshaws, talked of death. He had killed himself -- but how? Always her body went through it first, when she was told, suddenly, of an accident; her dress flamed, her body burnt. He had thrown himself from a window. Up had flashed the ground; through him, blundering, bruising, went the rusty spikes. There he lay with a thud, thud, thud in his brain, and then a suffocation of blackness. So she saw it. But why had he done it? And the Bradshaws talked of it at her party!</div>

They went on living (she would have to go back; the rooms were still crowded; people kept on coming). They (all day she had been thinking of Bourton, of Peter, of Sally), they would grow old. A thing there was that mattered; a thing, wreathed about with chatter, defaced, obscured in her own life, let drop every day in corruption, lies, chatter. This he had preserved. Death was defiance. Death was an attempt to communicate; people feeling the impossibility of reaching the centre which, mystically, evaded them; closeness drew apart; rapture faded, one was alone. There was an embrace in death.</div>

Oh, but how surprising!-- in the room opposite the old lady stared straight at her! She was going to bed. And the sky. It will be a solemn sky, she had thought, it will be a dusky sky, turning away its cheek in beauty. But there it was -- ashen pale, raced over quickly by tapering vast clouds. It was new to her. The wind must have risen. She was going to bed, in the room opposite. It was fascinating to watch her, moving about, that old lady, crossing the room, coming to the window. Could she see her? It was fascinating, with people still laughing and shouting in the drawing-room, to watch that old woman, quite quietly, going to bed. She pulled the blind now. The clock began striking. The young man had killed himself; but she did not pity him; with the clock striking the hour, one, two, three, she did not pity him, with all this going on. There! the old lady had put out her light! the whole house was dark now with this going on, she repeated, and the words came to her, Fear no more the heat of the sun. She must go back to them. But what an extraordinary night! She felt somehow very like him -- the young man who had killed himself. She felt glad that he had done it; thrown it away. The clock was striking. The leaden circles dissolved in the air. He made her feel the beauty; made her feel the fun. But she must go back. She must assemble. She must find Sally and Peter.

But he must stay with them for weeks and weeks. Of course he would; he would love to stay with them, and that was how it came out. All these years the Dalloways had never been once. Time after time they had asked them. Clarissa (for it was Clarissa of course) would not come. For, said Sally, Clarissa was at heart a snob -- one had to admit it, a snob. And it was that that was between them, she was convinced. Clarissa thought she had married beneath her, her husband being -- she was proud of it -- a miner's son. Every penny they had he had earned. As a little boy (her voice trembled) he had carried great sacks.</div>

Yet, said Sally, in her emotional way, with a rush of that enthusiasm which Peter used to love her for, yet dreaded a little now, so effusive she might become -- how generous to her friends Clarissa was! and what a rare quality one found it, and how sometimes at night or on Christmas Day, when she counted up her blessings, she put that friendship first. They were young; that was it. Clarissa was pure-hearted; that was it. Peter would think her sentimental. So she was. For she had come to feel that it was the only thing worth saying -- what one felt. Cleverness was silly. One must say simply what one felt.</div>

Sally asked (she herself was extremely happy); for, she admitted, she knew nothing about them, only jumped to conclusions, as one does, for what can one know even of the people one lives with every day? she asked. Are we not all prisoners? She had read a wonderful play about a man who scratched on the wall of his cell, and she had felt that was true of life -- one scratched on the wall. Despairing of human relationships (people were so difficult), she often went into her garden and got from her flowers a peace which men and women never gave her. But no; he did not like cabbages; he preferred human beings, Peter said. Indeed, the young are beautiful, Sally said, watching Elizabeth cross the room. How unlike Clarissa at her age! Could he make anything of her? She would not open her lips. Not much, not yet, Peter admitted. She was like a lily, Sally said, a lily by the side of a pool. But Peter did not agree that we know nothing. We know everything, he said; at least he did.</div>

No, that is true, said Sally. She felt more deeply, more passionately, every year. It increased, he said, alas, perhaps, but one should be glad of it -- it went on increasing in his experience.
