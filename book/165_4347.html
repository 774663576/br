<div class="line_en">Before arriving at Halo City, the dinghy passed by Lightspeed II. Cao Bin told Cheng Xin that Lightspeed II used to be a science city and was one of the two research centers studying how to lower the speed of light to achieve the black domain state, but it had been abandoned. Cheng Xin was very interested and wanted to stop for a visit. Reluctantly, Cao Bin turned the dinghy in that direction.</div>

Medium cities were space cities whose interior areas were below two hundred square kilometers but above fifty square kilometers.

<div class="line_en">As the dinghy approached, Cheng Xin realized that the city really was in ruins. It didn't spin, and the exterior appeared broken and cracked. In some places, the skin of the city had been ripped open, revealing the structural frame underneath. As she surveyed the giant ruin illuminated by the searchlights of the dinghy, Cheng Xin felt awe as well as terror. She thought of the ruin as a beached whale. It had lain there for eons, until all that was left was cracked skin and bones, and life had long ago drained away. She seemed to be looking at something even older than the Acropolis of Athens, with even more secrets.</div>

<div class="line_en">They slowly approached a large crack, several times as wide as the body of their dinghy. The beams in the structural frame were also bent and twisted, opening up a way to the interior. The beam of the searchlight shone in so that Cheng Xin could see the distant "ground," which was completely bare. After the dinghy descended a short distance into the interior of the space city, it stopped and swept the searchlight about them. Cheng Xin saw that the "ground" was bare in every direction. Not only were there no buildings, there wasn't anything at all to indicate that people had once lived here. The crisscrossing beams forming the frame for the city were visible on the "ground."</div>

E., researchers had succeeded in lowering the speed of light through a medium to an incredible seventeen meters per second in a laboratory setting. But this was fundamentally different from lowering the speed of light through vacuum. The former only required causing the atoms in the medium to absorb and re-emit the photons -- light continued to travel at its usual speed between atoms. This wasn't useful for the Black Domain Plan.</div>

Thus, lowering the speed of light required breakthroughs in fundamental physics -- and considerable serendipity.

<div class="line_en">"The Black Hole Project began in Year 1 of the Bunker Era and lasted eleven years. The planners did not invest much hope in it. Both theoretical calculations and astronomical observations had indicated that even black holes could not change the speed of light. These demons of the universe could only use their gravity fields to change the path of light and its frequency, not affecting the speed of light through vacuum one iota. However, to continue the research for the Black Domain Plan, it was necessary to create experimental conditions with superpowerful gravity fields, which depended on black holes. In addition, since a black domain is in essence a large-scale reduced-lightspeed black hole, perhaps close-range observation of a microscopic regular-lightspeed black hole would yield unexpected insights."</div>

Soon, the eight-kilometer-radius Leda melted entirely, and the potato-shaped rock turned into a red-glowing ball of lava. The lava ball shrank slowly, but glowed brighter and brighter, until it finally disappeared with a blinding flash. Observation showed that other than a small amount of material ejected by the radiation, most of the mass of Leda had been absorbed by the black hole.

The reason that black holes are traps from which even light cannot escape isn't because their overall gravitational power is overwhelming -- though a large black hole formed by the collapse of a star does possess immense overall gravity -- but due to the density of their gravitational fields. From a distance, the total gravity of a black hole is no different from the gravity of a quantity of normal matter of equivalent mass.

<div class="line_en">"What happened after Gao Way was sucked in was almost too strange to describe. Scientists observed the black hole via remote-controlled microscopes, and discovered that at the black hole's event horizon -- that's the surface of that tiny sphere with a diameter of twenty-one nanometers -- there was the figure of a person. It was Gao Way passing through the event horizon."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“以后的事情就很诡异了。高伟被吸人后，人们用遥控显微镜观察黑洞，发现黑洞的事件视界，也就是那个半径仅二十一纳米的微小球面上，有一个人影，那就是正在通过视界的高伟。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No one saw the process of Gao's disappearance, and if there was a recording, it's never been released. He was one of the Black Hole Project's principal physicists, and he had the password to open the protective net. I'm certain that he went in and drifted toward the black hole until he was too close to return… He probably wanted to get a close-up look at the object of his infatuation, or perhaps he wanted to enter into that singularity where the laws of nature no longer mattered, so that he could escape all this."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没有人看到高伟被吸入的过程，如果有录像也从未公布。他是黑洞项目的主要物理学家之一，有打开防护网入口的口令。他肯定进去了，一直向黑洞飘过去，一直接近到黑洞引力使他无法返回的距离……他可能只是想近距离看看这个让自己迷恋的东西，也可能是决定进入那个宇宙规律不起作用的奇点来逃避这一切。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Gao Way often hung against the protective net and stared for hours at the black hole five kilometers away. He watched its luminescence -- like we're doing now -- and sometimes claimed that the black hole was talking to him, that he could decipher the message of its flickering light."</div>

<div class="line_en">"And thus the life insurance company refused to pay out, although Gao Way had passed through the event horizon in his frame of reference, and should now be dead. But the insurance contract was made within the frame of reference of our world, and from this perspective, it is impossible to prove that Gao Way is dead. It's not even possible to begin the settlement process. Insurance claims settlement can only occur after the conclusion of an accident, but as Gao Way is still falling toward the black hole, the accident isn't over, and will never be over."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“于是，保险公司拒绝支付死亡保险金。虽然从高伟自己的参照系看，他通过了视界，应该已经死去；但保险合同是以我们这个现实世界为参照系制定的，在这个参照系中无法证明高伟已经死了。甚至理赔都不行，保险理赔必须等事故结束后才能进行，高伟仍在向黑洞坠落中。事故还没有结束，永远也不会结束。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Even more oddly, the figure's proportions were normal. Perhaps it was because the black hole was so small, but tidal forces did not seem to be at work. He had been compressed into the nanometer range, but space there was also extremely curved. More than one physicist believed that the body structure of Gao Way wasn't harmed at the event horizon. In other words, he's probably still alive at this moment."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“更离奇的是，那个人影各部分的比例是正常的，也许是由于黑洞很黑洞很小，潮汐力①并没有作用到他身上。他被压缩到如此微小，但那一处的空间曲率也极大，所以不止一名物理学家认为视界上的高伟身体结构并没有遭到破坏，换句话说，现在他可能还活着。”【注：①引力源对物体产生力的作用时，由于物体上各点到引力场距离不等，受到引力大小不同，从而产生引力差，对物体产生撕扯效应，这种引力差就是湖沙力。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"A woman then sued the World Academy of Sciences and demanded that the academy cease all further research on this black hole specimen. By that point, distant observation was unlikely to yield any further results. In order to be useful, future research would have to manipulate the black hole in some way, such as sending experimental objects into the black hole, which would generate massive amounts of radiation, and might disturb space-time in the vicinity of the event horizon. If Gao Way were still alive, these experiments might endanger his life. The woman didn't win her suit, but for a variety of reasons, research on this black hole stopped, and Lightspeed II was abandoned. Now we can only wait for this black hole to evaporate, which is estimated to take another half century."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这时有一个女人提出法庭诉讼，要求世界科学院立刻停止对该黑洞样品的研究。到目前为止，远距离观察已经没什么可做的了，进一步的研究必然要对黑洞进行作用，比如让实验物体进入黑洞，这就要产生大量的辐射，还可能对视界附近的时空环境产生扰动，如果高伟还活着，这就可能危害到他的生命。这女人并没有胜诉，但由于各方面的原因，对这个黑洞样品的研究还是中止了，光速二号也完全荒废，现在只能等待这个黑洞蒸发掉，据计算这还需要半个世纪。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"However, we now know that at least one woman did love Gao Way, though he never knew it. Later, that woman still came here regularly and tried to send radio or neutrino messages at the black hole. She even wrote her love in big letters and posted it against the protective net, hoping that the falling Gao Way could see it. But based on his own frame of reference, he had already passed through the event horizon into the singularity… It's a complicated matter."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不过现在我们知道，还是有一个女人爱上高伟了，可惜高伟一直不知道这事。后来那个女人还常到这里来，用电波或中微子向黑洞发信息，甚至写了一幅大标语蒙到防护网上表达爱意。不知道下落中的高伟能否看到，不过从他自己的参照系看，他已经穿过视界进人奇点……反正这事挺纠结的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
