<div class="line_en">It was after nightfall when, wet and tired, the travellers came at last to the Brandywine, and they found the way barred. At either end of the Bridge there was a great spiked gate; and on the further side of the river they could see that some new houses had been built: two-storeyed with narrow straight-sided windows, bare and dimly lit, all very gloomy and un-Shirelike.</div>

It's all these 'gatherers' and 'sharers', I reckon, going round counting and measuring and taking off to storage. They do more gathering than sharing, and we never see most of the stuff again."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是没错，今年相当不错，”霍伯说：“我们种了很多食物，但是我们不知道这些食物的下落。这些‘收集者’和‘分享者’到处点收、把东西储存起来。他们只收集，几乎不分享，大部分的东西就这么消失不见了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The hobbits at the gate still seemed ill at ease, evidently some rule or other was being broken; but there was no gain-saying four such masterful travellers, all armed, and two of them uncommonly large and strong-looking. Frodo ordered the gates to be locked again. There was some sense at any rate in keeping a guard, while ruffians were still about. Then the four companions went into the hobbit guard-house and made themselves as comfortable as they could. It was a bare and ugly place, with a mean little grate that would not allow a good fire. In the upper rooms were little rows of hard beds, and on every wall there was a notice and a list of Rules. Pippin tore them down. There was no beer and very little food, but with what the travellers brought and shared out they all made a fair meal; and Pippin broke Rule 4 by putting most of next day's allowance of wood on the fire.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="门边的哈比人似乎还是局促不安，很明显的这又违反了其他的规定，但是，他们不敢阻止这四名身经百战的同胞。佛罗多下令再将门锁起来，当外面还是盗匪肆虐的时候，晚上有人看门是蛮聪明的作法。然后四个人找了个哈比人住的营房钻了进去，尽可能的让自己过得舒服一些。这个屋子看起来冷冰冰的，布置得很丑，柴火也不够，烧不出什么像样的火来；上面的房间则是一整排硬床，每面墙上都贴着布告和规定的列表，皮聘把它们全撕了下来。这里没有啤酒，吃的东西也很少，不过，一行人把背包里面的食物分一分之后，大家还是吃得差强人意。皮聘把第二天的柴火丢进火炉里，潇洒的违反了四号规定。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They had not made any definite plans, but had vaguely thought of going down to Crickhollow together first, and resting there a bit. But now, seeing what things were like, they decided to go straight to Hobbiton. So the next day they set out along the Road and jogged along steadily. The wind had dropped but the sky was grey. The land looked rather sad and forlorn; but it was after all the first of November and the fag-end of autumn. Still there seemed an unusual amount of burning going on, and smoke rose from many points round about. A great cloud of it was going up far away in the direction of the Woody End.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们并没有作出什么天衣无缝的计划，只想到要先一起去溪谷地，在那边休息一下；但是，在看见目前的情形之后，他们决定立刻往哈比屯前进。第二天，他们就沿着大路朝向目标前进。风已经停了下来，但天空依旧一片晦暗，大地看起来有些哀愁和孤寂，但这毕竟已经是十一月初，秋天的尾声了。在他们的眼中，附近似乎在烧很多东西，黑烟从许多地方冒了出来，从林尾的地方冒出了一大团的黑气。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The new "Chief" evidently had means of getting news. It was a good forty miles from the Bridge to Bag End, but someone made the journey in a hurry. So Frodo and his friends soon discovered.</div>

<div class="line_en">As evening fell they were drawing near to Frogmorton, a village right on the Road, about twenty-two miles from the Bridge. There they meant to stay the night; The Floating Log at Frogmorton was a good inn. But as they came to the east end of the village they met a barrier with a large board saying NO ROAD; and behind it stood a large band of Shirriffs with staves in their hands and feathers in their caps, looking both important and rather scared.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Shirriff-house at Frogmorton was as bad as the Bridge-house. It had only one storey, but it had the same narrow windows, and it was built of ugly pale bricks, badly laid. Inside it was damp and cheerless, and supper was served on a long bare table that had not been scrubbed for weeks. The food deserved no better setting. The travellers were glad to leave the place.

<div class="line_en">The travellers trotted on, and as the sun began to sink towards the White Downs far away on the western horizon they came to Bywater by its wide pool; and there they had their first really painful shock. This was Frodo and Sam's own country, and they found out now that they cared about it more than any other place in the world. Many of the houses that they had known were missing. Some seemed to have been burned down. The pleasant row of old hobbit-holes in the bank on the north side of the Pool were deserted, and their little gardens that used to run down bright to the water's edge were rank with weeds. Worse, there was a whole line of the ugly new houses all along Pool Side, where the Hobbiton Road ran close to the bank. An avenue of trees had stood there. They were all gone. And looking with dismay up the road towards Bag End they saw a tall chimney of brick in the distance. It was pouring out black smoke into the evening air.</div>

And when Lotho sent his Men they got no change out of him. Tooks are lucky, they've got those deep holes in the Green Hills, the Great Smials and all, and the ruffians can't come at 'em; and they won't let the ruffians come on their land.

So things went from bad to worse. There wasn't no smoke left, save for the Men; and the Chief didn't hold with beer, save for his Men, and closed all the inns; and everything except Rules got shorter and shorter, unless one could hide a bit of one's own when the ruffians went round gathering stuff up 'for fair distribution': which meant they got it and we didn't, except for the leavings which you could have at the Shirriff-houses, if you could stomach them.

He's got other mills like it. But you've got to have grist before you can grind; and there was no more for the new mill to do than for the old. But since Sharkey came they don't grind no more corn at all. They're always a-hammering and a-letting out a smoke and a stench, and there isn't no peace even at night in Hobbiton.

<div class="line_en">The ruffians came tramping along the East Road, and without halting turned up the Bywater Road, which ran for some way sloping up between high banks with low hedges on top. Round a bend, about a furlong from the main road, they met a stout barrier of old farm-carts upturned. That halted them. At the same moment they became aware that the hedges on both sides, just above their heads, were all lined with hobbits. Behind them other hobbits now pushed out some more waggons that had been hidden in a field, and so blocked the way back. A voice spoke to them from above.</div>

<div class="line_en">Behind, the trapped Men in the lane, still about four score, tried to climb the barrier and the banks, and the hobbits were obliged to shoot many of them or hew them with axes. But many of the strongest and most desperate got out on the west side, and attacked their enemies fiercely, being now more bent on killing than escaping. Several hobbits fell, and the rest were wavering, when Merry and Pippin, who were on the east side, came across and charged the ruffians. Merry himself slew the leader, a great squint-eyed brute like a huge orc. Then he drew his forces off, encircling the last remnant of the Men in a wide ring of archers.</div>

<div class="line_en">At last all was over. Nearly seventy of the ruffians lay dead on the field, and a dozen were prisoners. Nineteen hobbits were killed, and some thirty were wounded. The dead ruffians were laden on waggons and hauled off to an old sand-pit nearby and there buried: in the Battle Pit, as it was afterwards called. The fallen hobbits were laid together in a grave on the hill-side, where later a great stone was set up with a garden about it. So ended the Battle of Bywater, 1419, the last battle fought in the Shire, and the only battle since the Greenfields, 1147, away up in the Northfarthing. In consequence, though it happily cost very few lives, it has a chapter to itself in the Red Book, and the names of all those who took part were made into a Roll, and learned by heart by Shire-historians. The very considerable rise in the fame and fortune of the Cottons dates from this time; but at the top of the Roll in all accounts stand the names of Captains Meriadoc and Peregrin.</div>

The blade turned on the hidden mail-coat and snapped. A dozen hobbits, led by Sam, leaped forward with a cry and flung the villain to the ground. Sam drew his sword.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="萨鲁曼转身准备离开，巧言畏缩的跟在后面。但正当萨鲁曼走到佛罗多身边时，他猛地拔出小刀，朝向佛罗多刺去，佛罗多身上的秘银甲让刀子断成两半。十几名哈比人在山姆带头之下，大呼着将这家伙压倒在地上，山姆拔出宝剑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No, Sam!" said Frodo. "Do not kill him even now. For he has not hurt me. And in any case I do not wish him to be slain in this evil mood. He was great once, of a noble kind that we should not dare to raise our hands against. He is fallen, and his cure is beyond us; but I would still spare him, in the hope that he may find it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，山姆！”佛罗多说：“就算这样也不要动手杀他，他没伤害到我。而且，不论如何，我都不希望他在这种满心邪恶的状况下被杀。他以前曾经非常伟大，属于我们不敢抬头望去的高贵种族，他堕落了，我们无法治好他，但我还是愿意饶恕他，希望他能改过自新。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Saruman rose to his feet, and stared at Frodo. There was a strange look in his eyes of mingled wonder and respect and hatred. "You have grown, Halfling," he said. "Yes, you have grown very much. You are wise, and cruel. You have robbed my revenge of sweetness, and now I must go hence in bitterness, in debt to your mercy. I hate it and you! Well, I go and I will trouble you no more. But do not expect me to wish you health and long life. You will have neither. But that is not my doing. I merely foretell."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="萨鲁曼站了起来，瞪着佛罗多。他的眼中混杂着惊讶、尊敬和仇恨。“半身人，你成长了，”他说：“没错，你已经成长了许多。你很睿智，却也非常残忍，你剥夺了我复仇的甜美，让我此后必须苟且偷生，永远欠你一命。我恨你！我还是会离开，不再打搅你们。但别妄想我会祝你健康长寿。这两者你都不会拥有。这不是我的诅咒，只是我的预言。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He walked away, and the hobbits made a lane for him to pass; but their knuckles whitened as they gripped on their weapons. Wormtongue hesitated, and then followed his master.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他缓缓走开，所有的哈比人都让出一条路给他，但他们紧握着武器的指节都因用力而泛白。巧言迟疑了一下，然后还是紧跟着主人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Wormtongue!" called Frodo. "You need not follow him. I know of no evil you have done to me. You can have rest and food here for a while, until you are stronger and can go your own ways."</div>

<div class="line_en">Wormtongue halted and looked back at him, half prepared to stay. Saruman turned. "No evil?" he cackled. "Oh no! Even when he sneaks out at night it is only to look at the stars.

<div class="line_cn" title="巧言迟疑了一瞬间，回头看着他，似乎真的准备留下来。萨鲁曼转过身。“没做过坏事？”他咯咯大笑。“喔，不！是啊，他晚上偷溜出去也只是看星星而已，多可爱！可是，我刚刚是不是听到有人问说罗索躲在哪里？巧言，你知道的，对吧？你愿意告诉他们吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Then I will," said Saruman. "Worm killed your Chief, poor little fellow, your nice little Boss. Didn't you, Worm? Stabbed him in his sleep, I believe. Buried him, I hope; though Worm has been very hungry lately. No, Worm is not really nice. You had better leave him to me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那就由我来说吧，”萨鲁曼说：“巧言杀死了你们的老大，那个可怜的小家伙，自以为很行的老板大人。对吧，巧言？我想应该是在睡梦中刺死了他吧。我希望他把它埋起来了，不过，最近巧言肚子一直很饿…算啦，巧言不是什么好东西，你们最好把他留给我。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">To the dismay of those that stood by, about the body of Saruman a grey mist gathered, and rising slowly to a great height like smoke from a fire, as a pale shrouded figure it loomed over the Hill. For a moment it wavered, looking to the West; but out of the West came a cold wind, and it bent away, and with a sigh dissolved into nothing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="萨鲁曼的身体四周突然冒出了灰气，像是火焰中冒出的浓烟一样飘往高空，一个形体模糊的身影俯瞰着山丘。它摇晃着，看着西方；但从西方吹来一阵冷风，它就在一阵叹息中彻底蒸发了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A look of wild hatred came into Wormtongue's red eyes. "You told me to; you made me do it," he hissed.</div>

<div class="line_en">Saruman laughed. "You do what Sharkey says, always, don't you, Worm? Well, now he says: follow!" He kicked Wormtongue in the face as he grovelled, and turned and made off. But at that something snapped: suddenly Wormtongue rose up, drawing a hidden knife, and then with a snarl like a dog he sprang on Saruman's back, jerked his head back, cut his throat, and with a yell ran off down the lane. Before Frodo could recover or speak a word, three hobbit-bows twanged and Wormtongue fell dead.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="萨鲁曼笑了，“你总是会照着萨基说的做，对吧？好啦，他现在说了：跟上来！”他对准巧言的脸踢了一脚，让他趴在地上哀嚎，随即转身离开。就在那一瞬间，有什么束缚断裂了──巧言突然站起来，掏出一柄隐藏的匕首，像野狗一般疯狂嘶吼着跳上萨鲁曼的背，一把将对方的头往后拉，割开了他的咽喉，迅即哀叫着往路的另一边奔逃。在佛罗多来得及恢复镇定或开口之前，三支箭劲射而出，巧言就这么死了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Frodo looked down at the body with pity and horror, for as he looked it seemed that long years of death were suddenly revealed in it, and it shrank, and the shrivelled face became rags of skin upon a hideous skull. Lifting up the skirt of the dirty cloak that sprawled beside it, he covered it over, and turned away.</div>
