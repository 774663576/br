<div class="line_en">"You will never walk again," the three-eyed crow had promised, "but you will fly." Sometimes the sound of song would drift up from someplace far below. The children of the forest, Old Nan would have called the singers, but those who sing the song of earth was their own name for themselves, in the True Tongue that no human man could speak. The ravens could speak it, though. Their small black eyes were full of secrets, and they would caw at him and peck his skin when they heard the songs.</div>

<div class="line_en">The moon was fat and full. Stars wheeled across a black sky. Rain fell and froze, and tree limbs snapped from the weight of the ice. Bran and Meera made up names for those who sang the song of earth: Ash and Leaf and Scales, Black Knife and Snowylocks and Coals. Their true names were too long for human tongues, said Leaf. Only she could speak the Common Tongue, so what the others thought of their new names Bran never learned.</div>

<div class="line_en">The moon was a crescent, thin and sharp as the blade of a knife. A pale sun rose and set and rose again. Red leaves whispered in the wind. Dark clouds filled the skies and turned to storms. Lightning flashed and thunder rumbled, and dead men with black hands and bright blue eyes shuffled round a cleft in the hillside but could not enter. Under the hill, the broken boy sat upon a weirwood throne, listening to whispers in the dark as ravens walked up and down his arms.</div>

<div class="line_en">"The secrets of the old gods," said Jojen Reed. Food and fire and rest had helped restore him after the ordeals of their journey, but he seemed sadder now, sullen, with a weary, haunted look about the eyes. "Truths the First Men knew, forgotten now in Winterfell… but not in the wet wild. We live closer to the green in our bogs and crannogs, and we remember. Earth and water, soil and stone, oaks and elms and willows, they were here before us all and will still remain when we are gone."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“旧神的秘密。”玖健回答道。食物，温暖的火焰和休息帮助他从旅途的折磨中恢复了过来。但是他现在看起来有些难过，温怒，眼中满是厌倦和困扰的神情。“先民们了解真相，在临冬城这一切都被忘记…但是在泽地不是这样，在我们的沼泽和湖泊中我们离大自然更加亲近，我们仍然记得。土地和水，油和岩石，橡树榆树和杨柳，它们在我们之前就生活在这里，在我们死后依然会生活在这里。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What will I know?" Bran asked the Reeds afterward, when they came with torches burning brightly in their hand, to carry him back to a small chamber off the big cavern where the singers had made beds for them to sleep. "What do the trees remember?"</div>

<div class="line_en">The moon was a black hole in the sky. Wolves howled in the wood, sniffing through the snowdrifts after dead things. A murder of ravens erupted from the hillside, screaming their sharp cries, black wings beating above a white world. A red sun rose and set and rose again, painting the snows in shades of rose and pink. Under the hill, Jojen brooded, Meera fretted, and Hodor wandered through dark tunnels with a sword in his right hand and a torch in his left. Or was it Bran wandering?</div>

<div class="line_en">The singers made Bran a throne of his own, like the one Lord Brynden sat, white weirwood flecked with red, dead branches woven through living roots.

Once he had been lowered into place, they covered him with warm furs.</div>

<div class="line_en">The moon was a crescent, thin and sharp as the blade of a knife. Snowflakes drifted down soundlessly to cloak the soldier pines and sentinels in white.

<div class="line_en">Slipping into Summer's skin had become as easy for him as slipping on a pair of breeches once had been, before his back was broken. Changing his own skin for a raven's night-black feathers had been harder, but not as hard as he had feared, not with these ravens. "A wild stallion will buck and kick when a man tries to mount him, and try to bite the hand that slips the bit between his teeth," Lord Brynden said, "but a horse that has known one rider will accept another. Young or old, these birds have all been ridden. Choose one now, and fly."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="上夏天的身已经变得和他没残废的时候穿马裤一样容易了。上一只黑色羽翼的乌鸦就要难很多，但是不像他曾经害怕的那么难，不是和这些乌鸦。“当一个人想骑一只野马时，马会反抗和踢打，尝试去咬握着卡在它嘴间的缰绳的手。”布林登大人说道。“但是一被骑过的马将会接受其他的骑手。年轻的或者老的，这些鸟儿都是被骑过的马。选一只，然后飞翔。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He chose one bird, and then another, without success, but the third raven looked at him with shrewd black eyes, tilted its head, and gave a quork, and quick as that he was not a boy looking at a raven but a raven looking at a boy. The song of the river suddenly grew louder, the torches burned a little brighter than before, and the air was full of strange smells. When he tried to speak it came out in a scream, and his first flight ended when he crashed into a wall and ended back inside his own broken body. The raven was unhurt. It flew to him and landed on his arm, and Bran stroked its feathers and slipped inside of it again. Before long he was flying around the cavern, weaving through the long stone teeth that hung down from the ceiling, even flapping out over the abyss and swooping down into its cold black depths.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他选了一只鸟，然后又选了一只，没有成功，但是第三只乌鸦用精明的黑眼睛看着他，歪着头，打量着他，快的好像他不是一个男孩在看着一只乌鸦，而是一只乌鸦在看着一个男孩。大河之歌突然变得更加响亮，火把比以前更亮了一点，空气中充满了奇怪的味道。当他想说些什么的时候，话语变成了大叫，他的第一次飞翔在撞上一面墙之后结束了，然后他就回到了残破的身体。乌鸦没有受伤。它飞向他，然后落在他的胳膊上，布兰轻抚着它的羽毛，然后又一次进入乌鸦的身体。不久以后他就可以围着洞穴飞翔了，穿梭在洞顶的钟乳石林，甚至飞出深渊，冲向寒冷黑暗的深处。">查看中文翻译</div>

Once or twice he pinched his arm with his fingers, really hard, but the only thing that did was make his arm hurt. In the beginning he had tried to count the days by making note of when he woke and slept, but down here sleeping and waking had a way of melting into one another.

<div class="line_en">The moon was fat and full. Summer prowled through the silent woods, a long grey shadow that grew more gaunt with every hunt, for living game could not be found. The ward upon the cave mouth still held; the dead men could not enter. The snows had buried most of them again, but they were still there, hidden, frozen, waiting. Other dead things came to join them, things that had once been men and women, even children. Dead ravens sat on bare brown branches, wings crusted with ice. A snow bear crashed through the brush, huge and skeletal, half its head sloughed away to reveal the skull beneath. Summer and his pack fell upon it and tore it into pieces. Afterward they gorged, though the meat was rotted and half-frozen, and moved even as they ate it.</div>

<div class="line_en">The caves were timeless, vast, silent. They were home to more than three score living singers and the bones of thousands dead, and extended far below the hollow hill. "Men should not go wandering in this place," Leaf warned them. "The river you hear is swift and black, and flows down and down to a sunless sea. And there are passages that go even deeper, bottomless pits and sudden shafts, forgotten ways that lead to the very center of the earth. Even my people have not explored them all, and we have lived here for a thousand thousand of your man-years."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在山洞里没有时间概念，空旷，寂静。他们和六十多个活着的森林之子还有上千个死去的生活在一起，生活在这遥远的山体下方的巨大山洞里。“人们不应该在这种地方闲逛。”叶子警告他们。“你们听到的那条暗河汹涌黑暗，向下一直流向地下暗海。那里有一些小路可以通向更深的地方，无底洞和深深的竖井，被遗忘的道路通向大地的最深处。甚至我的人都没有完全了解所有的道路——我们在这里生活了数千年的时间。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Under the hill they still had food to eat. A hundred kinds of mushrooms grew down here. Blind white fish swam in the black river, but they tasted just as good as fish with eyes once you cooked them up. They had cheese and milk from the goats that shared the caves with the singers, even some oats and barleycorn and dried fruit laid by during the long summer. And almost every day they ate blood stew, thickened with barley and onions and chunks of meat. Jojen thought it might be squirrel meat, and Meera said that it was rat. Bran did not care. It was meat and it was good. The stewing made it tender.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在山下他们仍然有食物可吃。上百种蘑菇生长在这里。白色的盲眼鱼遨游在黑色的河水里，但是它们吃起来和曾经吃过的煮熟的有眼睛的鱼一样好吃。他们还有从山洞中的歌者那里分享的奶酪和山羊奶，甚至还有一些在漫长的夏天储备起来的燕麦，大麦和一些水果干。几乎每天他们都会吃血色杂炖，浓稠的汤里有大麦，洋葱和大块的肉。玖健认为那可能是松鼠肉，梅拉却说那是老鼠肉。但是布兰并不在意，那确实是肉，而且很好吃，煮过之后更加鲜嫩可口。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Though the men of the Seven Kingdoms might call them the children of the forest, Leaf and her people were far from childlike. Little wise men of the forest would have been closer. They were small compared to men, as a wolf is smaller than a direwolf. That does not mean it is a pup. They had nut-brown skin, dappled like a deer's with paler spots, and large ears that could hear things that no man could hear. Their eyes were big too, great golden cat's eyes that could see down passages where a boy's eyes saw only blackness. Their hands had only three fingers and a thumb, with sharp black claws instead of nails.</div>

Before the First Men came all this land that you call Westeros was home to us, yet even in those days we were few. The gods gave us long lives but not great numbers, lest we overrun the world as deer will overrun a wood where there are no wolves to hunt them. That was in the dawn of days, when our sun was rising. Now it sinks, and this is our long dwindling. The giants are almost gone as well, they who were our bane and our brothers. The great lions of the western hills have been slain, the unicorns are all but gone, the mammoths down to a few hundred. The direwolves will outlast us all, but their time will come as well. In the world that men have made, there is no room for them, or us."</div>

He even crossed the slender stone bridge that arched over the abyss and discovered more passages and chambers on the far side. One was full of singers, enthroned like Brynden in nests of weirwood roots that wove under and through and around their bodies. Most of them looked dead to him, but as he crossed in front of them their eyes would open and follow the light of his torch, and one of them opened and closed a wrinkled mouth as if he were trying to speak.

To touch her he would need to pull himself along the ground with his hands, dragging his legs behind him. The floor was rough and uneven, and it would be slow going, full of scrapes and bumps.

<div class="line_en">Lord Eddard Stark sat upon a rock beside the deep black pool in the gods wood, the pale roots of the heart tree twisting around him like an old man's gnarled arms. The greatsword Ice lay across Lord Eddard's lap, and he was cleaning the blade with an oilcloth.</div>

<div class="line_en">"A man must know how to look before he can hope to see," said Lord Brynden. "Those were shadows of days past that you saw, Bran. You were looking through the eyes of the heart tree in your godswood. Time is different for a tree than for a man. Sun and soil and water, these are the things a weirwood understands, not days and years and centuries. For men, time is a river. We are trapped in its flow, hurtling from past to present, always in the same direction. The lives of trees are different. They root and grow and die in one place, and that river does not move them. The oak is the acorn, the acorn is the oak. And the weirwood… a thousand human years are a moment to a weirwood, and through such gates you and I may gaze into the past."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“人们在知道他有所渴望的时候，必须知道如何去通过鱼梁木观看。”布林登大人说道。“你看到的都是往日的阴影，布兰，你在通过临冬城的神木林的心树观看。树的时间概念和人是不同的。太阳，油和水，这些事鱼梁木不懂得的事情，不是时间的问题。对于人来说，时间就像大河。我们都在它的洪流之中，从过去到现在顺流而行，总是在同一个方向。树却不一样。他们的树根生长，死亡都在同一个地方，时间没有改变他们。橡树就是橡果，橡果就是橡树。鱼梁木…人类的一千年对鱼梁木来说就是一瞬间，通过这种方式，我们可以看到过去。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Once you have mastered your gifts, you may look where you will and see what the trees have seen, be it yesterday or last year or a thousand ages past. Men live their lives trapped in an eternal present, between the mists of memory and the sea of shadow that is all we know of the days to come. Certain moths live their whole lives in a day, yet to them that little span of time must seem as long as years and decades do to us. An oak may live three hundred years, a redwood tree three thousand. A weirwood will live forever if left undisturbed. To them seasons pass in the flutter of a moth's wing, and past, present, and future are one. Nor will your sight be limited to your godswood. The singers carved eyes into their heart trees to awaken them, and those are the first eyes a new greenseer learns to use… but in time you will see well beyond the trees themselves."</div>

<div class="line_en">The rest of his father's words were drowned out by a sudden clatter of wood on wood. Eddard Stark dissolved, like mist in a morning sun. Now two children danced across the godswood, hooting at one another as they dueled with broken branches. The girl was the older and taller of the two. Arya! Bran thought eagerly, as he watched her leap up onto a rock and cut at the boy. But that couldn't be right. If the girl was Arya, the boy was Bran himself, and he had never worn his hair so long. And Arya never beat me playing swords, the way that girl is beating him. She slashed the boy across his thigh, so hard that his leg went out from under him and he fell into the pool and began to splash and shout. "You be quiet, stupid," the girl said, tossing her own branch aside. "It's just water. Do you want Old Nan to hear and run tell Father?" She knelt and pulled her brother from the pool, but before she got him out again, the two of them were gone.</div>

<div class="line_en">After that the glimpses came faster and faster, till Bran was feeling lost and dizzy. He saw no more of his father, nor the girl who looked like Arya, but a woman heavy with child emerged naked and dripping from the black pool, knelt before the tree, and begged the old gods for a son who would avenge her. Then there came a brown-haired girl slender as a spear who stood on the tips of her toes to kiss the lips of a young knight as tall as Hodor. A dark-eyed youth, pale and fierce, sliced three branches off the weirwood and shaped them into arrows. The tree itself was shrinking, growing smaller with each vision, whilst the lesser trees dwindled into saplings and vanished, only to be replaced by other trees that would dwindle and vanish in their turn. And now the lords Bran glimpsed were tall and hard, stern men in fur and chain mail. Some wore faces he remembered from the statues in the crypts, but they were gone before he could put a name to them.</div>
