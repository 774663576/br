<div class="line_en">Kitty sat for a while, still on the edge of the bed, hunched up like an imbecile. Her mind was vacant. A shudder passed through her. She staggered to her feet and, going to the dressing-table, sank into a chair. She stared at herself in the glass. Her eyes were swollen with tears; her face was stained and there was a red mark on one cheek where his had rested. She looked at herself with horror. It was the same face. She had expected in it she knew not what change of degradation.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她在床沿上呆呆地坐了一会儿，背脊像痴呆了一样佝偻着，脑子里一片空白。一阵战栗袭过她的身体。她踉踉跄跄地站起来，走到梳妆台前，瘫倒在一张椅子里。她看着镜中的自己，她的眼睛哭肿了，脸上泪痕斑斑，一边的脸颊上有一块红，是他的脸蹭过来时留下的。她惊恐不已地望着自己。还是那张脸，没有一点变化，她本来期待那将会是一张低贱的脸。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then, letting her face fall on her arms, she wept bitterly. Shame, shame! She did not know what had come over her. It was horrible. She hated him and she hated herself. It had been ecstasy. Oh, hateful! She could never look him in the face again. He was so justified. He had been right not to marry her, for she was worthless; she was no better than a harlot. Oh, worse, for those poor women gave themselves for bread. And in this house too into which Dorothy had taken her in her sorrow and cruel desolation! Her shoulders shook with her sobs. Everything was gone now. She had thought herself changed, she had thought herself strong, she thought she had returned to Hong Kong a woman who possessed herself; new ideas flitted about her heart like little yellow butterflies in the sunshine and she had hoped to be so much better in the future; freedom like a spirit of light had beckoned her on, and the world was like a spacious plain through which she could walk light of foot and with head erect. She had thought herself free from lust and vile passions, free to live the clean and healthy life of the spirit; she had likened herself to the white egrets that fly with leisurely flight across the rice-fields at dusk and they are like the soaring thoughts of a mind at rest with itself; and she was a slave. Weak, weak! It was hopeless, it was no good to try, she was a slut.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着她又把脸埋在臂弯里，悲苦地落起泪来。羞耻，她是多么羞耻啊！她不知道她怎么会鬼迷心窍。那简直太可怕了。她恨他，同样也恨自己。那只是一种幻觉啊。呃，她是多么可恨！她再也没脸面对他的眼睛了，他是对的，他的确不应该娶她，因为她一文不值。她比妓女好不了多少。不，甚至比妓女还坏，那些悲惨的女人毕竟是以此来讨生计的。还有可怜的多萝西，她是如此悲伤地将她领进了这座房子。她抽泣着，身体随之一起一伏。一切都完了。她以为她已经彻底变了，变得坚强了，她以为回到香港的将是一个冷静自制的女人。崭新的思想会像阳光下黄色的蝴蝶一样在她的心头缤纷起舞，她的未来会是那么美好。自由像光的精灵向她招手，世界像广阔的平原，任她高昂着头颅轻盈地漫步。她以为她已经不再受低贱的欲望诱惑，而是会在洁净、单纯的精神生活当中自由自在地徜徉。她曾把自己比作黄昏时分慵懒地飞过稻田的白鹭，这些白鹭就像一个休憩的灵魂展翅翱翔的翩翩思绪，而她宁愿做这自由的奴隶。太虚幻了，太虚幻了。那是遥不可及的，根本无须去尝试。她根本就是个荡妇。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She would not go in to dinner. She sent the boy to tell Dorothy that she had a headache and preferred to remain in her room. Dorothy came in and, seeing her red, swollen eyes, talked for a little in her gentle, commiserating way of trivial things. Kitty knew that Dorothy thought she had been crying on account of Walter and, sympathizing like the good and loving wife she was, respected the natural sorrow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她不想去吃晚饭。她叫童仆告诉多萝西她患了头疼病，不想出屋了。多萝西过来看她，发现她的眼睛又红又肿，便温柔而悲戚地和她聊了一些琐事。凯蒂知道多萝西一定以为她是因为瓦尔特的缘故才又哭了，所以像一位好主妇那样对这一人之常情示以同情和尊重。">查看中文翻译</div>
