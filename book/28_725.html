<div class="line_en">I knew only a little about previous First Ladies and how they'd approached the position. I knew that Jackie Kennedy had dedicated herself to redecorating the White House. I recalled that Rosalynn Carter had sat in on cabinet meetings, Nancy Reagan had gotten into some trouble accepting free designer dresses, and Hillary Clinton had been derided for taking on a policy role in her husband's administration. Once, a couple of years earlier at a luncheon for U. S. Senate spouses, I'd watched -- half in shock, half in awe -- as Laura Bush posed, serene and smiling, for ceremonial photos with about a hundred different people, never once losing her composure or needing a break. First Ladies showed up in the news, having tea with the spouses of foreign dignitaries; they sent out official greetings on holidays and wore pretty gowns to state dinners. I knew that they normally picked a cause or two to champion as well.</div>

<div class="line_en">I was humbled and excited to be First Lady, but not for one second did I think I'd be sliding into some glamorous, easy role. Nobody who has the words "first" and "black" attached to them ever would. I stood at the foot of the mountain, knowing I'd need to climb my way into favor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="成为第一夫人让我感到既激动又惶恐。但是有一点，那就是我从未觉得自己即将面对的是一份光鲜体面又毫不费力的工作，一秒钟也没有。我想，任何人只要被贴上“第一”“有色人种”这样的标签，应该都不会这么认为吧。现在，我已来到山脚下，深知只有不断努力向上攀登，才能获得尊重和喜爱。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I understood already that I'd be measured by a different yardstick. As the only African American First Lady to set foot in the White House, I was "other" almost by default. If there was a presumed grace assigned to my white predecessors, I knew it wasn't likely to be the same for me. I'd learned through the campaign stumbles that I had to be better, faster, smarter, and stronger than ever. My grace would need to be earned. I worried that many Americans wouldn't see themselves reflected in me, or that they wouldn't relate to my journey. I wouldn't have the luxury of settling into my new role slowly before being judged. And when it came to judgment, I was as vulnerable as ever to the unfounded fears and racial stereotypes that lay just beneath the surface of the public consciousness, ready to be stirred up by rumor and innuendo.</div>

<div class="line_en">The seventy-six days between election and inauguration felt like a critical time to start setting the tone for the kind of First Lady I wanted to be. After all I'd done to lever myself out of corporate law and into more meaningful community-minded work, I knew I'd be happiest if I could engage actively and work toward achieving measurable results. I intended to make good on the promises I'd made to the military spouses I'd met while campaigning -- to help share their stories and find ways to support them. And then there were my ideas for planting a garden and looking to improve children's health and nutrition on a larger scale.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从贝拉克当选美国总统到他正式宣誓就职，这期间一共有七十六天的过渡时间。在我看来，这段时间极为关键，我必须明确自己想成为什么样的第一夫人，并开始为这样的形象定下基调。早年，我曾涉足法律行业，后来成功转型，开始从事更有意义的社区服务工作。我非常清楚，如果我积极投入工作并努力取得了可以量化的结果，那么我就会感觉很幸福。参加竞选时，我曾对服役军人的配偶们许下承诺，要对外分享他（她）们的故事，并寻找途径帮助他（她）们。因此，我要努力兑现自己的承诺。此后，我又有了开垦菜园以种植果蔬，在全美推行健康学生餐以改善儿童健康状况、促进其健康成长的想法。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For me, it revived an old internal call-and-response, one that tracked all the way back to high school, when I'd shown up at Whitney Young and found myself suddenly gripped by doubt.

<div class="line_en">I didn't want to go about any of it casually. I intended to arrive at the White House with a carefully thought-out strategy and a strong team backing me. If I'd learned anything from the ugliness of the campaign, from the myriad ways people had sought to write me off as angry or unbecoming, it was that public judgment sweeps in to fill any void. If you don't get out there and define yourself, you'll be quickly and inaccurately defined by others. I wasn't interested in slotting myself into a passive role, waiting for Barack's team to give me direction. After coming through the crucible of the last year, I knew that I would never allow myself to get that banged up again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="作为第一夫人，我不允许自己随意地、毫无准备地应对任何事务。我对自己的要求是：在我到达白宫的时候，就已经准备好了详细的、经过慎重考虑的履职方案，以及一个绝对支持我的强有力的团队。在参加竞选的过程中，我亲眼见证了种种丑陋行径，人们以各种各样的方式将我描述为一个“愤怒”“不得体”的女人，从而贬低我的形象。若要问我从中得到了什么教训，那就是：公共舆论无孔不入。如果你不明白这一点，而且不能及时定义自己的话，很快就会被别人定义，而这种定义一定不是客观的。我当然不希望自己陷入被动，等待贝拉克的团队来给我指导。在经历了竞选的严酷考验之后，我告诉自己：我决不允许自己再搞砸一次。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Six days after the election, I flew to D. C., having set up meetings with administrators at a couple of different schools. Under normal circumstances, I'd have focused solely on the academics and culture of each place, but we were far past the possibility of normal now. There were all sorts of cumbersome new factors to be considered and discussed -- Secret Service protocols, emergency evacuation setups, strategies for protecting our kids' privacy now that they had the eyes of a nation upon them. The variables had become exponentially more complex. More people were involved; more conversations needed to be had before even a small decision could be made.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="贝拉克当选后的第六天，我飞到华盛顿，去提前预约好的几所学校与校方面谈。要是在平常，我为孩子们选择学校的时候只会关注各个学校的教学水平和校园文化，但是那时，我们一家人已经远远不在“平常”这一范围之内了。我们面前出现了各种从未遇到过的、繁杂的因素需要考虑、讨论—特工处安全保卫制度、突发状况紧急撤离计划，以及保护孩子个人隐私的种种方案，因为全美国的人都在关注着她们俩。我们所面临的可变因素陡然增加，并且越来越复杂。越来越多的人进入我们的生活，即使是再小的决定，也要提前与很多人商议后才能做出。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">My mind raced with all that needed to get done. There had been no way to plan for this transition. Doing anything ahead of time would have been viewed as presumptuous. For a planner like me, it had been hard to sit back. So now we went into overdrive. My top priority was looking out for Sasha and Malia. I wanted to get them settled as quickly and comfortably as possible, which meant nailing down the details of our move and finding them a new school in Washington, a place where they'd be happy.</div>

<div class="line_en">Thankfully, I was able to keep my key campaign staffers -- Melissa, Katie, and Kristen -- working with me during the transition. We immediately set about figuring out the logistics of our family's move while also beginning to hire staff -- schedulers, policy experts, communications pros -- for my future East Wing offices, as well as interviewing people for jobs in the family residence. One of my first hires was Jocelyn Frye, an old friend from law school who had a fantastic analytic mind and agreed to come on as my policy director, helping to oversee the initiatives I planned to launch.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="幸运的是，在我角色转变的过程中，我的竞选团队中最关键的几个人—梅丽莎、凯蒂、克里斯汀一直和我在一起，与我并肩作战。我们立刻行动，首先搞定了我们全家搬迁的物流安排，同时着手为我将来在白宫东翼的办公室招募职员，比如日程安排专员、政策顾问、对外联络专员，也为总统官邸—我们一家将来在白宫的住所—面试合适的员工。我们招募的第一批雇员中有一位名叫乔斯林·弗莱伊，她是我在哈佛大学法学院学习时结识的老朋友。此人洞察力极强，善于分析。她表示愿意加入，做我的政策顾问主任，对于我计划要发起的各项活动，她都会帮我最后把关。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Barack, meanwhile, was working on filling positions for his cabinet and huddling with various experts on ways to rescue the economy. By now, more than ten million Americans were unemployed, and the auto industry was in a perilous free fall. I could tell by the hard set of my husband's jaw following these sessions that the situation was worse than most Americans even understood. He was also receiving daily written intelligence briefings, suddenly privy to the nation's heavier secrets -- the classified threats, quiet alliances, and covert operations about which the public remained largely unaware.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="与此同时，贝拉克也火力全开，一边忙着为他将来的内阁补充成员，一边马不停蹄地举行各类专家磋商会议，讨论如何提振美国经济。当时，全美失业人数超过一千万人，汽车市场陷入低迷，销量一落千丈。每开完一次会议，贝拉克都眉头深锁，牙关紧咬。我从他的表情中感觉到，当时美国经济的真实状况一定比绝大多数美国人想象的还要差。这时候，贝拉克已经开始每天接收书面情报简报，有点猝不及防地参与到了整个国家的重大机密中—隐秘的潜在威胁、暗中进行的结盟，以及公众丝毫不曾察觉的秘密行动。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Now that the Secret Service would be protecting us for years to come, the agency selected official code names for us. Barack was "Renegade," and I was "Renaissance."

After one of my meetings, I went back to Reagan National Airport to meet Barack, who was due in on a chartered flight from Chicago. As was protocol for the president-elect, we'd been invited by President and Mrs. Bush to drop by for a visit to the White House and had scheduled it to coincide with my trip to look at schools. I stood waiting at the private terminal as Barack's plane touched down. Next to me was Cornelius Southall, one of the agents heading my security detail.</div>

I had yet to grasp that Barack's protection was still only half-visible. I didn't know that he'd also, at all times, have a nearby helicopter ready to evacuate him, that sharpshooters would position themselves on rooftops along the routes he traveled, that a personal physician would always be with him in case of a medical problem, or that the vehicle he rode in contained a store of blood of the appropriate type in case he ever needed a transfusion. In a matter of weeks, just ahead of Barack's inauguration, the presidential limo would be upgraded to a newer model -- aptly named the Beast -- a seven-ton tank disguised as a luxury vehicle, tricked out with hidden tear-gas cannons, rupture-proof tires, and a sealed ventilation system meant to get him through a biological or chemical attack.</div>

We learned, courtesy of our guide, that in the late eighteenth century First Lady Abigail Adams had used the giant space to hang her laundry and that decades later, during the Civil War, Union troops had temporarily been quartered there. A number of First Daughters' weddings had taken place in the East Room. Abraham Lincoln's and John F. Kennedy's caskets had also lain there for viewing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们是从白宫东翼最大的东厅开始参观的。历史上，东厅主要用于举办各类盛大舞会以及大型招待会。我们首先观赏了天花板上悬吊的巨型雕花水晶吊灯，然后仔细观看了悬挂在一面墙上的开国总统乔治·华盛顿的大幅镀金画像。画像上，华盛顿总统脸颊绯红、面容严肃。我们从这位接待员的讲解中得知，在18世纪末期，白宫还未建成的时候，时任第一夫人阿比盖尔·亚当斯曾利用这里巨大的空间晒衣服。几十年之后，在南北战争期间，北军曾临时驻扎在这里。此外，东厅还曾举办过多位美国“第一女儿”的婚礼，两位遇刺的美国总统亚伯拉罕·林肯和约翰·肯尼迪的灵柩也曾放置在这里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But who, honestly, could blame her? It's a huge place, the White House, with 132 rooms, 35 bathrooms, and 28 fireplaces spread out over six floors, all of it stuffed with more history than any single tour could begin to cover. It was frankly hard to imagine real life happening there. Somewhere on the level below, government employees flowed in and out of the building, while somewhere above, the president and First Lady lived with their Scottish terriers in the family residence. But we were standing then in a different area of the house, the frozen-in-time, museum-like part of the place, where symbolism lived and mattered, where the country's old bones were on display.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是说实话，谁又能指责她做得不对呢？白宫确实太大了，地上地下一共六层，有一百三十二个房间、三十五个卫生间、二十八个壁炉。所有地方都有其各自的历史，单单一次参观根本不可能了解全部。坦白说，我根本无法想象能有人在这里过着真真切切的生活。一方面，在下面一层，政府雇员每天因为公务进进出出；另一方面，在上面的楼层，布什总统和他的第一夫人，以及两只苏格兰梗在那里生活。当时，我们只是站在白宫的一角参观，感觉这里犹如时间凝固的博物馆，我们看到的只是这个国家发展的脉络，听到的也是美国的历史和各个珍藏品的象征意义。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I could feel my mind sifting through all the various presidents that day, trying to match what I remembered from history classes with visions of the families who'd walked these actual halls. Malia, who was about eight at the time, seemed mostly awestruck by the size of the place, while Sasha, at five, was doing her best not to touch the many things that weren't supposed to be touched. She gamely held it together as we moved from the East Room to the Green Room, which had delicate emerald-silk walls and came with a story about James Madison and the War of 1812, and the Blue Room, which had French furniture and came with a story about Grover Cleveland's wedding, but when our guide asked if we'd now please follow him to the Red Room, Sasha looked up at me and blurted, in the unquiet voice of an aggrieved kindergartner, "Oh nooo, not another ROOM!" I quickly shushed her and gave her the mother-look that said, "Do not embarrass me."</div>

Her husband was just as welcoming, possessing a magnanimous Texas spirit that seemed to override any political hard feelings. Throughout the campaign, Barack had criticized the president's leadership frequently and in detail, promising voters he would fix the many things he viewed as mistakes. Bush, as a Republican, had naturally supported John McCain's candidacy. But he'd also vowed to make this the smoothest presidential transition in history, instructing every department in the executive branch to prepare briefing binders for the incoming administration. Even on the First Lady's side, staffers were putting together contact lists, calendars, and sample correspondence to help me find my footing when it came to the social obligations that came with the title. There was kindness running beneath all of it, a genuine love of country that I will always appreciate and admire.</div>

<div class="line_en">For me, the girls' sense of comfort and home was key. If we pared back all the pomp and circumstance -- the fairy-tale unreality of moving into a big house that came with chefs, a bowling alley, and a swimming pool -- what Barack and I were doing was something no parent really wants to do: yanking our kids midyear out of a school they loved, taking them away from their friends, and plopping them into a new home and new school without a whole lot of notice. I was preoccupied by this thought, though I was also comforted by the knowledge that other mothers and children had successfully done this before.</div>

The private area of the White House occupies about twenty thousand square feet on the top two stories of the main historical structure -- the one you'd recognize from photos with its iconic white pillars. I saw the dining room where First Families ate their meals and popped my head into the tidy kitchen, where a culinary staff was already at work on dinner. I saw the guest quarters on the top floor, scouting them out as a possible place my mother could live, if we could manage to talk her into moving in with us. (There was a small gym up there as well, which was the place both Barack and President Bush got most excited about during the guys' version of the tour.)

<div class="line_en">Laura took me into a pretty, light-filled room off the master bedroom that was traditionally used as the First Lady's dressing room. She pointed out the view of the Rose Garden and the Oval Office through the window, adding that it gave her comfort to be able to look out and sometimes get a sense of what her husband was doing. Hillary Clinton, she said, had shown her this same view when she'd first come to visit the White House eight years earlier. And eight years before that, her mother-in-law, Barbara Bush, had pointed out the view to Hillary. I looked out the window, reminded that I was part of a humble continuum.</div>

And Laura kindly invited me to return with Sasha and Malia a couple of weeks after that first visit, on a day when her own girls, Jenna and Barbara, could be there to introduce my kids to the "fun parts" of the White House, showing them everything from the plush seats of the in-house movie theater to how to slide down a sloping hallway on the top floor.</div>

<div class="line_en">After a lot of research, two visits, and many conversations, we'd opted to enroll our daughters at Sidwell Friends, a private Quaker school with an excellent reputation. Sasha would be a second grader in the lower school, which was located in suburban Bethesda, Maryland, and Malia would attend fifth grade on the main campus, which sat on a quiet block just a few miles north of the White House. Both kids would need to commute by motorcade, escorted by a group of armed Secret Service agents, some of whom would also remain posted outside their classroom doors and follow them to every recess, playdate, and sports practice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="经过大量的前期调研、两次会面，以及数次沟通之后，我们为萨沙和玛利亚选择了塞维尔友谊学校，这是一所私立贵格会 [1]学校，口碑极好。萨沙将在位于马里兰州贝塞斯达的低年级校区就读二年级，玛利亚将在位于白宫北部几英里处的主校区就读五年级，主校区所在的街区十分安静。两个孩子日常通勤都需要专门的车队接送，由特工处几名全副武装的特工全程保护，其间还专门安排特工在她们的教室外站岗执勤，陪伴她们度过每一段课间休息时间、每一次小聚会以及每一节体育课。【注：[1]贵格会，基督教新教的一个派别，成立于17世纪，因一名早期领袖的号诫“听到上帝的话而发抖”而得名Quaker，中文意译为“震颤者”，音译“贵格会”。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We ended up moving to Washington right after our traditional Christmas holiday in Hawaii so that Sasha and Malia could start school just as their new classmates were coming back from winter break. It was still about three weeks ahead of the inauguration, which meant that we had to make temporary arrangements, renting rooms on the top floor of the Hay-Adams hotel in the center of the city. Our rooms overlooked Lafayette Square and the North Lawn of the White House, where we could see the grandstand and metal bleachers being set up in preparation for the inaugural parade. On a building across from the hotel, someone had hung a massive banner that read, "Welcome Malia and Sasha." I choked up a little at the sight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们和往常一样在夏威夷度过圣诞节后，就搬家去了华盛顿，这样，萨沙和玛利亚就能够在圣诞假期结束后与她们的新同学正式见面，然后开始新的学习生活。那时，距离贝拉克正式就任总统还有三周时间，也就是说，我们要安排一段临时过渡期。于是，我们在华盛顿市中心的海亚当斯酒店顶层租了几间房子。从我们的房间能够俯瞰拉法叶广场和白宫的北草坪，还能看见为总统就职典礼以及随后的庆祝大游行专门搭建的临时性金属露天看台。酒店对面的一幢楼上，悬挂着一条巨大的横幅，上面写着“欢迎玛利亚和萨沙”。看到这一景象时，我惊得差点说不出话来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I held on to a hope that Sasha and Malia's bubble might be different, that they could remain safe but not contained, that their range would be greater than ours. I wanted them to make friends, real friends -- to find kids who liked them for reasons other than that they were Barack Obama's daughters. I wanted them to learn, to have adventures, to make mistakes and bounce back. I hoped that school for them would be a kind of shelter, a place to be themselves. Sidwell Friends appealed to us for a lot of reasons, including the fact that it was the school Chelsea Clinton had attended when her father was president. The staff knew how to safeguard the privacy of high-profile students and had already made the sorts of security accommodations that would now be needed for Malia and Sasha, which meant we wouldn't be too big a drain on the school's resources. Above all, I liked the feel of the place. The Quaker philosophy was all about community, built around the idea that no one individual should be prized over another, which seemed to me like a healthy counterbalance to the big fuss that now surrounded their father.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我一直希望萨沙和玛利亚的生活能够有所不同，我希望她们既要安全，又不至于处处受限；我希望她们能够触及的范围比我和贝拉克要更宽更广；我希望她们能够交到自己的朋友，真正的朋友—这些朋友喜欢她们绝不是因为她们是贝拉克·奥巴马的女儿；我希望她们能够刻苦学习、勇于探险，可以犯错误，但能在改正错误的过程中不断成长；我希望学校对她们来说能够成为庇护所，能让她们活出自我。塞维尔友谊学校对我们来说是一所很有吸引力的学校，其中一个原因就是：在克林顿担任美国总统期间，他的女儿切尔西就在这里上学。因此，这所学校的工作人员熟知应该如何保护一些备受瞩目的学生以及她们的个人隐私，并且学校已经制定出了各类安全保障措施，这对玛利亚和萨沙来说恰好适用。也就是说，萨沙和玛利亚的到来并不会给学校的资源带来太大的压力。最重要的是，我喜欢这所学校的氛围。贵格会一向主张共同体意识，所有人一律平等，不优待任何人也不要求任何人优待自己。对我来说，这种理念刚好能够适时地抵消一下现在整日围绕在她们父亲身边的各种小题大做。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We lived in a kind of bubble now, sealed off at least partially from the everyday world. I couldn't remember the last time I'd run an errand by myself or walked in a park just for fun. All movements first required a discussion about both security and schedule. The bubble had formed around us slowly over the course of the campaign as Barack's notoriety grew and as it became more necessary to put boundaries up between us and the general public -- and, in some instances, between us and our friends and family members. It was odd, being in the bubble, and not a feeling I particularly enjoyed, but I also understood it was for the best. With a regular police escort, our vehicles no longer stopped at traffic lights. We rarely walked in or out of a building's front door when we could be rushed through a service entrance or loading dock on a side street. From the Secret Service's point of view, the less visible we could be, the better.</div>

We arrived first at the upper school campus, where Malia and I hustled past a gauntlet of news cameras and into the building, the two of us flanked by Secret Service agents.

I was supposed to pick out everything from bath towels and toothpaste to dish soap and beer for the White House residence, choose my outfits for the inauguration ceremony and fancy balls that would follow it, and figure out logistics for the 150 or so of our close friends and relatives who'd be coming from out of town as our guests. I delegated what I could to Melissa and other members of my transition team.

I had a busy day ahead, every minute of it scheduled with meetings, but my mind would stay locked on our daughters. What kind of day were they having? What were they eating? Were they being gawked at or made to feel at home? I'd later see a media photo of Sasha taken during the morning trip to school, one that brought me to tears. I believe it was snapped as I was dropping off Malia, while Sasha waited in the car with my mom.

As long as I've known him, he's been this way: extra-vigilant when it comes to matters of money and ethics, holding himself to a higher standard than even what's dictated by law. There's an age-old maxim in the black community: You've got to be twice as good to get half as far.

<div class="line_en">To my great relief, both our kids came home happy after the first day of school, and the second, and the third. Sasha brought back homework, which she'd never had before. Malia was already signed up to sing in a middle school choral concert. They reported that kids in other grades sometimes did a double take when they saw them, but everyone was nice. Each day afterward, the motorcade ride to Sidwell Friends felt a little more routine. After about a week, the girls felt comfortable enough to start traveling to school without me, swapping my mother in as their regular escort, which automatically made drop-offs and pickups a bit less of a production, involving fewer agents, vehicles, and guns.</div>

Jill had recently earned her doctorate in education and had managed to teach English at a community college in Delaware not just through Joe's years as a senator but also through his two presidential campaigns. Like me, she was interested in finding new ways to support military families. Unlike me, she had a direct emotional connection to the issue: Beau Biden, Joe's older son, was serving in Iraq with the National Guard. He'd been granted a short leave to travel to Washington and see his dad get sworn in as vice president.</div>

As cold as I would eventually get that day, I'd forever remember how many people stood outside for many more hours than I did, convinced it was worth it to endure the chill.

At some point earlier, Barack had received the authorization codes that would allow him to access the country's nuclear arsenal and a briefing on the protocols for using them. From now on, wherever he went, he'd be closely trailed by a military aide carrying a forty-five-pound briefcase containing launch authentication codes and sophisticated communications devices, often referred to as the nuclear football.

At that same moment, many of our friends, relatives, and colleagues were finding their seats on the platform outside.

I remember how Sasha, too small for her presence to register amid a sea of adults, stood proudly on a footstool in order to stay visible. I remember the crispness of the air. I lifted Lincoln's Bible, and Barack placed his left hand on it, vowing to protect the U. S. Constitution -- with a couple of short sentences, solemnly agreeing to take on the country's every concern. It was weighty and at the same time it was joyful, a feeling mirrored in the inaugural speech Barack would then deliver.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这天，临近中午的时候，贝拉克、我，还有两个女儿，我们一家一起站在了整个美国面前。说真的，我只记住了当时一些最微不足道的事，比如：洒在贝拉克额头上的阳光是那么的明媚；当联邦最高法院首席大法官约翰·罗伯茨宣布就职仪式正式开始时，喧闹的人群立刻安静下来，传递出他们的敬意；萨沙当时因为个头儿太小，生怕自己被人山人海的成年人挡住，于是特地站在台子上，表情自豪，让大家看到了她的存在。我还记得当时空气非常清新。我拿起当年林肯总统的红色封皮的《圣经》，贝拉克将他的左手按在上面，开始宣誓，他宣誓要恪守、维护和捍卫美国宪法。誓言虽然很简短，但贝拉克做出了郑重的承诺，他承诺从此关注整个国家、所有美国人都关注的事情。整个仪式既隆重又充满乐趣，这一点从随后贝拉克发表的就职演说中就能体会一二。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Barack and I both knew what this day represented to many Americans, especially those who'd been a part of the civil rights movement. He'd made a point of including the Tuskegee Airmen, the history-making African American pilots and ground crews who fought in World War II, among his guests. He'd also invited the group known as the Little Rock Nine, the nine black students who in 1957 had been among the first to test the Supreme Court's Brown v. Board of Education decision by enrolling at an all-white high school in Arkansas, enduring many months of cruelty and abuse in the name of a higher principle. All of them were senior citizens now, their hair graying and shoulders curving, a sign of the decades and maybe also the weight they'd carried for future generations. Barack had often said that he aspired to climb the steps of the White House because the Little Rock Nine had dared to climb the steps of Central High School. Of every continuum we belonged to, this was perhaps the most important.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我和贝拉克都很清楚，对于全美国人来说，尤其对于那些曾积极参加美国民权运动的人来说，这一天究竟意味着什么。贝拉克早已打定主意，决心要邀请“塔斯克基飞行员”—创造过历史的非洲裔美国飞行员，以及参加过第二次世界大战的地勤人员作为他的特邀嘉宾参加就职典礼。他还邀请了著名的“小石城事件” [2]的九名当事人。1957年，九名非洲裔美国学生被阿肯色州的一所白人中学录取，成为联邦最高法庭判决布朗诉托皮卡教育局案 [3]后的第一批试验者，但他们也因为当时“白人至上主义”的观念而遭受了数月的不平等对待和歧视。他们九个人如今都已年老，花白的头发、佝偻的身体，都是岁月留下的痕迹，或许也是他们替后代负重前行的痕迹。贝拉克以前经常说，他之所以要立志跨入白宫，就是因为“小石城事件”九名当事人曾经敢于跨入一所白人中学。在我们所属的所有连续体中，这才是最重要的一个。【注：[2]“小石城事件”发生在美国阿肯色州小石城，围绕公立学校中的种族隔离政策展开的对抗事件。1957年9月，小石城学校委员会宣布逐步改变学校中种族隔离的现象，在白人的中心中学首批录取了九名黑人学生。[3]布朗诉托皮卡教育局案，被认为是美国历史上具有里程碑意义的诉讼案，当时最高法院做出裁决：州法律规定公立学校实行种族隔离侵犯了黑人学生平等受教育的权利，因违宪而必须终止。实际上，此案裁决的影响远远超出了公立学校的范围，这一裁决还为美国各方面向种族隔离提出挑战提供了法律基础。该裁决废止了各州实行种族隔离的权力，为种族融合和民权运动铺平了道路。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="从寒风中冻得瑟瑟发抖的观众的脸上，贝拉克的这句话再一次得到了验证。整个华盛顿广场以及庆祝大游行沿线的每一寸土地上都站满了观众，无论从哪一个方向看去，都是人山人海，一眼望不到头。我似乎觉得我们一家人马上就要落入他们的怀抱中了。我们与所有人从此达成了一项约定：你们选择了我们，我们也一定会铭记你们。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">By the time Barack and I climbed back in, the two girls were breathless and laughing, having released themselves from all ceremonial dignity. They'd shucked off their hats and messed up each other's hair and were thrashing around, engaged in a sisterly tickle fight. Tired out, finally, they sprawled across the seats and rode the rest of the way with their feet kicked up, blasting Beyoncé on the car stereo as if it were just any old day.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当我和贝拉克再次回到车上的时候，发现两个孩子笑得喘不过气来，她们已经将自己从那正式的礼仪束缚中彻底解放了出来。她们摘下帽子，搞乱对方的头发，东倒西歪，开始了她们姐妹的逗乐式争吵。直到玩得筋疲力尽，她们才回到座椅上，摊开四肢躺下来，将双脚高高抬起。一路上，汽车音响里播放的都是碧昂丝的歌曲，我们的生活像是又回到了过去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I marveled at how our daughters had managed themselves perfectly throughout the inauguration, never fidgeting, slouching, or forgetting to smile. We still had many thousands of people watching from the sides of the road and on television as the motorcade made its way up Pennsylvania Avenue, though the darkened windows made it difficult for anyone to see inside. When Barack and I stepped out to walk a short stretch of the parade route and wave to the public, Malia and Sasha stayed behind inside the warm cocoon of the moving limo. It seemed to hit them then that they were finally relatively alone and out of sight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在就职典礼的整个过程中，两个女儿都表现很好，没有一丝烦躁、懒散，还不时地向公众致以微笑，这让我感到非常吃惊。当我们的车队驶到宾夕法尼亚大道时，还有成千上万的观众站在道路两旁观看，即使我们的车窗颜色很深，从外面根本看不见里面，也挡不住他们的热情。当然，还有无数守在电视机旁的观众。贝拉克和我走下车，沿着游行路线走了一小段，并向公众招手。这期间，玛利亚和萨沙则留在暖和的凯迪拉克车内，坐在后排没有下车。当时，她俩好像终于得到解脱，离开公众的视线，有了点属于自己的空间。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As the sun began to set on Inauguration Day, the air temperature dropped further. Barack and I, along with the indefatigable Joe Biden, spent the next two hours in an outdoor reviewing stand in front of the White House, watching bands and floats from all fifty states pass by us on Pennsylvania Avenue. At some point, I stopped feeling my toes, even after someone passed me a blanket to wrap around my legs and feet. One by one, our guests in the stand excused themselves to go get ready for the evening balls.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就职典礼那天，太阳落山的时候，气温再次下降，天气更冷了。我和贝拉克，还有不知疲倦的乔·拜登在白宫前面的看台上参加了长达两个小时的户外军队检阅仪式，观看来自全美五十个州的军乐队、仪仗队从宾夕法尼亚大道上一一穿过。有那么一阵子，我的脚趾似乎都冻僵了，后来，有人递给我一条毯子，我用它裹住了腿和脚，可即便如此，我的脚趾似乎还是麻木的。随着仪式的进行，和我们一同在看台上观看仪式的其他宾客都借口说要为晚上的庆祝舞会做准备，于是一个接一个地提前离开了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was nearly 7:00 p. m. when the last marching band finished and Barack and I walked through the dark and into the White House, arriving for the first time as residents. Over the course of the afternoon, the staff had pulled off an extraordinary top-to-bottom flip of the residence, whisking the Bushes' belongings out and our belongings in. In the span of about five hours, the carpets had been steamed to help keep Malia's allergies from being activated by traces of the former president's dogs. Furniture was brought in and arranged, floral decorations set out. By the time we rode the elevator upstairs, our clothes were organized neatly in the closets; the kitchen pantry had been stocked with our favorite foods. The White House butlers who staffed the residence, mostly African American men who were our age or older, stood poised to help us with anything we needed.</div>

<div class="line_en">I was almost too cold to take anything in. We were due at the first of ten inaugural balls in less than an hour. I remember seeing very few people upstairs beyond the butlers, who were strangers to me. I remember, in fact, feeling a little lonely as I moved down a long hallway, past a bunch of closed doors. For the last two years, I'd been constantly surrounded by people, with Melissa, Katie, and Kristen always right by my side. Now, suddenly, I felt very much on my own. The kids had already headed to another part of the house for their evening of fun. My mom, Craig, and Maya were staying with us in the residence but had been packed into cars and shuttled off already to the night's festivities. A hairdresser waited to style me; my gown hung on a rack. Barack had disappeared to take a shower and put on his tux.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我当时实在太冷了，一点儿胃口也没有。我们的时间并不多，还有十场庆祝舞会要参加，而且要在一小时之内赶去参加第一场。我记得，当时在楼上除了几位陌生的管家之外，我几乎看不到别的任何人。我记得，当我一个人穿过一段很长的走廊、经过一扇又一扇紧闭的房门时，我感到有一些孤独。毕竟，在过去两年里，我的身边总是围着不少人，梅丽莎、凯蒂以及克里斯汀几乎一直陪在我身边。但是现在，突然间，只剩下我自己一个人了。两个孩子这会儿应该正在白宫的其他房间欢度美好的夜晚。我母亲、哥哥克雷格以及玛雅本来要和我们一起待在白宫住所的，但是他们现在也都乘车去参加晚上的庆祝活动了。此时此刻，只有一名发型设计师等着为我设计新发型，我稍后需要穿的晚礼服正挂在衣架上；贝拉克去冲澡了，他待会儿也要换上出席舞会的晚礼服。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It had been an incredible, symbolic day for our family and I hoped for the country, but it was also a kind of ultramarathon. I had only about five minutes alone to soak in a warm bath and reboot myself for what came next. Afterward, I'd have a few bites of steak and potatoes that Sam Kass had prepared. I'd have my hair touched up and makeup redone, and then I'd slip into the ivory silk chiffon gown I'd picked for the night ahead, specially made for me by a young designer named Jason Wu. The dress had a single shoulder strap and delicate organza flowers sewn across it, each one with a tiny crystal at its center, and a full skirt that cascaded richly to the floor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对我们一家人，甚至对整个美国来说，这一天都是不可思议而又充满象征意义的一天，但对我来说，更像是一场超长距离的马拉松赛跑。我只有五分钟的独处时间，于是我赶紧泡了一个热水澡，打起精神准备参加接下来的活动。随后，我吃了几口助理厨师长萨姆·卡斯准备的牛排和土豆。我重新换了发型，化了妆，然后穿上我专门为当晚挑选的晚礼服。这是一款象牙色的单肩雪纺绸礼服，是一位名叫吴季刚的年轻华裔设计师专门为我设计的，礼服上面布满了精致的欧根纱小花朵，每个小花朵中心又都镶嵌了一颗非常小的水晶，长长的裙摆一直垂到地面。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In my life so far, I'd worn very few gowns, but Jason Wu's creation performed a potent little miracle, making me feel soft and beautiful and open again, just as I began to think I had nothing of myself left to show. The dress resurrected the dreaminess of my family's metamorphosis, the promise of this entire experience, transforming me if not into a full-blown ballroom princess, then at least into a woman capable of climbing onto another stage. I was now FLOTUS -- First Lady of the United States -- to Barack's POTUS. It was time to celebrate.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在我的人生当中，到目前为止，我几乎没有穿过礼服，不过，吴季刚设计的礼服可以说创造了一个小小的奇迹：在我以为自己已经没有什么可以向别人展示的时候，它让我再次觉得自己温柔、美丽，同时又开朗自信。这件晚礼服使我们家原本朦胧的蜕变，以及这段经历所蕴含的前景都变得鲜活起来，让我变成了一位充满吸引力的舞厅公主，如果这个比喻有点夸张的话，那至少可以说它让我意识到自己是有能力登上另一个舞台的女人。现在，贝拉克是美利坚合众国的总统，我是美利坚合众国的第一夫人，这是一个多么值得庆祝的时刻！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That night, Barack and I went to the Neighborhood Ball, the first inaugural ball ever to be broadly accessible and affordable to the general public and where Beyoncé-- real-life Beyoncé-- sang a stunning, full-throated rendition of the R&amp;B classic "At Last," which we'd chosen as our "first dance" song. From there, we moved on to a Home States Ball and after that to the Commander in Chief Ball, then onward to the Youth Ball, and six more beyond that. Our stay at each one was relatively brief and pretty much exactly the same: A band played "Hail to the Chief," Barack made a few remarks, we tried to beam our appreciation to those who'd come, and as everyone stood and watched, we slow danced yet another time to "At Last."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当晚，我和贝拉克出席了就职仪式后的第一场舞会—“睦邻舞会”，这是有史以来第一场普通公众可以参加、价格上也能够承受得起的总统就职舞会。舞会上，著名歌手碧昂丝亲自献唱，她翻唱了经典爵士情歌《最后》 [4]，这也是我和贝拉克为我们的“第一支舞”亲点的歌曲。碧昂丝歌声洪亮饱满，点燃了整个舞会。接着，我们去参加了“贝拉克故乡舞会”，又参加了“三军总司令就职舞会”“青年舞会”以及其他六场舞会。我们在每场舞会待的时间都不是很长，流程也基本一样：一支乐队演奏歌曲《向统帅致敬》 [5]，贝拉克接着点评了几句，我们展露笑容，向前来参加舞会的人们表示感谢，在大家热情的期盼和注视下，我和贝拉克又在《最后》的音乐声中跳了一支舞。【注：[4] 《最后》（At Last），由美国著名词曲作者马克·戈登（Mack Gordon）和哈利·沃伦（Harry Warren）为《太阳谷小夜曲》（Sun Valley Serenade）合作编写的歌曲。[5] 《向统帅致敬》（Hail to the Chief），这首歌是美国总统官方歌曲。自1954年由美国国防部确认了其官方地位后，常演奏于美国总统在各种公众场合之时。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was close to 2:00 a. m. by the time we got ourselves there. Barack and I walked across the marble floors leading to the East Room to find the party in full swing, drinks flowing and elegantly dressed people swirling beneath the sparkling chandeliers. Wynton Marsalis and his band were playing jazz on a small stage at the back of the room. I saw friends from nearly every phase of my life -- Princeton friends, Harvard friends, Chicago friends, Robinsons and Shieldses galore. These were the people I wanted to laugh with, to say, How in holy hell did we all get here?</div>

I had no energy left to verbalize some First Lady-like excuse or even wave to my friends. I just walked quickly away over the thick red carpet, ignoring the agents who trailed behind me, ignoring everything as I found the elevator to the residence and took myself there -- down an unfamiliar hallway and into an unfamiliar room, out of my shoes and out of my gown and into our strange new bed.</div>
