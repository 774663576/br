<div class="line_en">Next day they drove downtown to buy things needed for the camp: any wearable purchase worked wonders with Lo. She seemed her usual sarcastic self at dinner. Immediately afterwards, she went up to her room to plunge into the comic books acquired for rainy days at Camp Q (they were so thoroughly sampled by Thursday that she left them behind). I too retired to my lair, and wrote letters. My plan now was to leave for the seaside and then, when school began, resume my existence in the Haze household; for I knew already that I could not live without the child. On Tuesday they went shopping again, and I was asked to answer the phone if the camp mistress rang up during their absence. She did; and a month or so later we had occasion to recall our pleasant chat. That Tuesday, Lo had her dinner in her room. She had been crying after a routine row with her mother and, as had happened on former occasions, had not wished me to see her swollen eyes: she had one of those tender complexions that after a good cry get all blurred and inflamed, and morbidly alluring.</div>

<div class="line_en">I regretted keenly her mistake about my private aesthetics, for I simply love that tinge of Botticellian pink, that raw rose about the lips, those wet, matted eyelashes; and, naturally, her bashful whim deprived me of many opportunities of specious consolation. There was, however, more to it than I thought. As we sat in the darkness of the veranda (a rude wind had put out her red candles), Haze, with a dreary laugh, said she had told Lo that her beloved Humbert thoroughly approved of the whole camp idea "and now," added Haze, "the child throws a fit; pretext: you and I want to get rid of her; actual reason: I told her we would exchange tomorrow for plainer stuff some much too cute night things that she bullied me into buying for her. You see, she sees herself as a starlet; I see her as a sturdy, healthy, but decidedly homely kid. This, I guess, is at the root of our troubles."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我为她对我隐秘密美观的误解感到深深遗撼，费就正爱那种波提切利的粉红，两片含苞待绽的玫瑰，濡湿黯淡的睫毛；很自然，她害羞的怪念头夺去了许多给我以特殊安慰的机会。但，这比我想的还严重。当我仍坐在漆黑的因台上（一阵粗野的风吹灭了她红色的烛光），黑兹夫人凄凉地笑笑，说她已经告诉洛她热爱的亨伯特完全同意夏今营这件事，“谁料，”黑兹接着说，“那小孩大发雷雷；借口：你我要扔掉她；真正原因：我告诉她明天我们要换几件朴素一点的衣服，她却逼迫我给她买惹眼的着装。你看，她把她自己看成大明星了；我看却却不过是结实、健康摄本不漂亮的毛丫头。我想这就是我们麻烦不断的根源吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On Wednesday I managed to waylay Lo for a few seconds: she was on the landing, in sweatshirt and green-stained white shorts, rummaging in a trunk. I said something meant to be friendly and funny but she only emitted a snort without looking at me. Desperate, dying Humbert patted her clumsily on her coccyx, and she struck him, quite painfully, with one of the late Mr. Haze's shoetrees. "Doublecrosser," she said as I crawled downstairs rubbing my arm with a great show of rue. She did not condescend to have dinner with Hum and mum: washed her hair and went to bed with her ridiculous books. And on Thursday quiet Mrs. Haze drove her to Camp Q.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="星期三，我设法在路上截住她几秒钟：她穿着汗衫和白底绿点短裤，正在楼顶走廊的柜子里翻找箱子。我说了表示友好又逗乐的话，但她只哼了一声，根本本看我。绝望得要死的亨伯特拙劣地在她尾骨上拍了一下，但她却用过世的黑兹先生的鞋楦还他一击。“骗子，”她说。我慢慢踱下楼梯，挠着胳膊，表现出极大的悔恨。绝不愿屈尊来和亨及妈妈一起吃饭：洗了头，便抱着笑话书上了床。明天星期四，黑兹夫人将踞手缀脚开车送她去Q营地。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As greater authors than I have put it: "Let readers imagine" etc. On second thought, I may as well give those imaginations a kick in the pants. I knew I had fallen in love with Lolita forever; but I also knew she would not be forever Lolita. She would be thirteen on January 1. In two years or so she would cease being a nymphet and would turn into a "young girl," and then, into a "college girl"-- that horror of horrors. The word "forever" referred only to my own passion, to the eternal Lolita as reflected in my blood. The Lolita whose iliac crests had not yet flared, the Lolita that today I could touch and smell and hear and see, the Lolita of the strident voice and the rich brown hair -- of the bangs and the swirls at the sides and the curls at the back, and the sticky hot neck, and the vulgar vocabulary --"revolting," "super," "luscious," "goon," "drip"-- that Lolita, my Lolita, poor Catullus would lose forever. So how could I afford not to see her for two months of summer insomnias? Two whole months out of the two years of her remaining nymphage! Should I disguise myself as a somber old-fashioned girl, gawky Mlle Humbert, and put up my tent on the outskirts of Camp Q, in the hope that its russet nymphets would clamor: "Let us adopt that deep-voiced D. P.," and drag the sad, shyly smiling Berthe au Grand Pied to their rustic hearth. Berthe will sleep with Dolores Haze!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="正象比我更伟大的作家写的：“让读者去想象”，等等。再一想，我在喘息中还是对那些想象兴致极浓。我知道我已经永远地爱上了洛丽塔；但我同样知道她不可能永远是洛丽塔。一月一日她就要十三岁了。再过差不多两年，她统不再是性感少女，而变成一位“年轻的女郎”，然后，变成“女大学生”——失望连着失望。“永远”这个词是仅就我自己的感情而言，是仅就那个注入我逾液中的永恒的洛丽塔而言。那个洛丽塔她的肠骨顶还没有向外展开，那个洛丽塔今天我可以触摸、可以闻、可以听、可以看，那个洛丽塔有一副粗嗓门和褐色厚发——梳着刘海，两侧鬈着，秀背微弓，玉颈亭亭，又满口粗话——“造反”、“高级”、“性感”、“笨蛋”、“乏味的家伙”——那个洛丽塔，我的洛丽塔，可怜的加塔拉斯，就要永远失去她了。因此我怎么能承受两个月见不到她的夏季失眠症呢？在她尚保持性感少女气质仅剩的两年里的两个月！我是不是应该把自己乔装成阴郁的旧式少女，愚笨的亨伯特小姐，而后在Q营地附近竖起我的帐篷，满心希望它的深红色会使性感少女们哗然：“我们接纳那个低嗓内的D.P．吧，”然后把忧郁的、含羞而笑的“大脚”伯思拉进她们朴素的家中。伯恩于是有可能和多洛雷斯·黑兹睡在一起！">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">One drop of rare honey, however, that Thursday did hold in its acorn cup. Haze was to drive her to the camp in the early morning. Upon sundry sounds of departure reaching me, I rolled out of bed and leaned out of the window. Under the poplars, the car was already athrob.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，爱人，那个星期四，一滴珍奇的蜂蜜确实落进了它的漏斗。黑兹夫人一早就要开车送她到营地去，分别前杂乱的响声传到我的耳里，我匆忙翻身下床，身子探出窗外。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A moment later I heard my sweetheart running up the stairs. My heart expanded with such force that it almost blotted me out. I hitched up the pants of my pajamas, flung the door open: and simultaneously Lolita arrived, in her Sunday frock, stamping, panting, and then she was in my arms, her innocent mouth melting under the ferocious pressure of dark male jaws, my palpitating darling! The next instant I heard her -- alive, unraped -- clatter downstairs. The motion of fate was resumed. The blond leg was pulled in, the car door was slammed -- was re-slammed -- and driver Haze at the violent wheel, rubber-red lips writhing in angry, inaudible speech, swung my darling away, while unnoticed by them or Louise, old Miss Opposite, an invalid, feebly but rhythmically waved from her vined veranda.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不一会儿，我听见我的心上人跑上楼梯。我的心被一种力量扩胀了，它几乎要把我摧毁。我连忙套上睡裤，一把拉开门：几乎同时，洛丽塔到了，穿着礼拜日的长裙，气喘嘘嘘，而后扑进了我的怀里，她天真的嘴在男性黑乎乎的上下唇凶猛压迫下软化了，我颤抖的小心肝！下一瞬间我听见她——活生生的未被奸污的——烯哩哗啦急促跑下楼。命运的意念重新恢复了。棕色的双腿收进去，车门砰然关上——又砰了一声——而后黑兹驾驶员粗野地踩下启动，橡胶红色的嘴唇吐着什么气话，我的爱就这样被带走了；而她们和露易丝都没注意到，老奥泊西特小姐，一个病人，正从她爬满青藤的游廊里有节奏地微微招着手。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Idle dry dreams. Two months of beauty, two months of tenderness, would be squandered forever, and I could do nothing about it, but nothing, mais rien.</div>

<div class="line_en">On the sidewalk, Louise stood shading her eyes with her hand, as if the little traveler were already riding into the low morning sun. The gesture proved to be premature. "Hurry up!" shouted Haze. My Lolita, who was half in and about to slam the car door, wind down the glass, wave to Louise and the poplars (whom and which she was never to see again), interrupted the motion of fate: she looked up -- and dashed back into the house (Haze furiously calling after her).</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在白杨树下，小汽车已经浮动起来。路边，露易丝站在那儿，用手挡着眼睛，似乎那位小旅行者已经驶进低低的太阳。那手势真是幼稚。“快！”黑兹叫道。我的洛丽塔，半个身子在车内，正要使足劲关车门，又摇下玻璃，朝露易丝和白杨树（她再也没见到他们和它们）挥手告别，突然命运的意念打断了她：她抬头望来——而后冲回房间（黑兹交她身后狂怒喊叫）。">查看中文翻译</div>
