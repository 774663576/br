<div class="line_en">In the split second it took Langdon to take in his surroundings, he realized he was in a sacred place. The embellishments in the oblong room, though old and faded, were replete with familiar symbology. Pentagram tiles. Planet frescoes. Doves. Pyramids.</div>

<div class="line_en">Directly in front of him, framed in the opening of the balcony, stood the Hassassin. He was bare chested, standing over Vittoria, who lay bound but very much alive. Langdon felt a wave of relief to see her. For an instant, their eyes met, and a torrent of emotions flowed -- gratitude, desperation, and regret.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在他正对面，背朝著通往阳台的门，站著那个哈撒辛。他光著上身而立，薇多利雅躺在他面前，双手反绑，但还活得好端端的。一看到她，兰登大大鬆了口气。那一刻，两人目光相遇，种种感情奔流而出──有感激，有绝望，还有遗憾。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Hassassin seemed for a moment to be considering it. Exhaling, he dropped his shoulders. It was a clear motion of surrender, and yet at that exact instant the Hassassin's arm seemed to accelerate unexpectedly. There was a blur of dark muscle, and a blade suddenly came tearing through the air toward Langdon's chest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈撒辛一时之间似乎在考虑。然后吐出一口气，双肩下垂。这显然是个投降的动作，但就在这一刻，哈撒辛突如其来地往前振臂一挥。暗色的肌肉一闪，一把刀猛然划破空气，朝兰登胸口飞过来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Langdon stepped forward, grasping the rusted bar, and aimed the splintered end directly at the Hassassin. The cut on his hand bit sharply. "Let her go."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登往前走了一步，抓著那根生锈的铁棒，把断裂的那端对准了哈撒辛。手上的割伤一阵刺痛。「放她走。」">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Whether it was instinct or exhaustion that buckled Langdon's knees at that moment, he didn't know, but the knife sailed past his left ear and clattered to the floor behind him. The Hassassin seemed unfazed. He smiled at Langdon, who was kneeling now, holding the metal bar. The killer stepped away from Vittoria and moved toward Langdon like a stalking lion.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那一刻，兰登搞不清是直觉使然还是纯粹累极，他双膝一软跪下去，那把刀从他左耳边飞掠而过，铿锵跌在他身后的地板上。哈撒辛似乎毫不气馁，望著跪在地上、手持铁棒的兰登微笑。他离开薇多利雅身边，像隻追踪猎物的狮子般，走向兰登。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As Langdon scrambled to his feet, lifting the bar again, his wet turtleneck and pants felt suddenly more restrictive. The Hassassin, half-clothed, seemed to move much faster, the wound on his foot apparently not slowing him at all. Langdon sensed this was a man accustomed to pain. For the first time in his life, Langdon wished he were holding a very big gun.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登匆忙爬起身，再度举起铁棒，忽然觉得自己溼答答的套头高领衫和裤子更碍事。哈撒辛上身光著，似乎行动得更快，脚上的伤口显然丝毫没有拖慢他的速度。兰登感觉到眼前是个习于伤痛的人。毕生头一次，兰登但愿自己手上拿的是一把很大的枪。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Hassassin circled slowly, as if enjoying himself, always just out of reach, moving toward the knife on the floor. Langdon cut him off. Then the killer moved back toward Vittoria. Again Langdon cut him off.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈撒辛缓缓绕著圈子，好像很自得其乐，始终与兰登保持一段距离。他朝向地板上那把刀移动，兰登挡住他的路。然后杀手又移向薇多利雅，兰登再度拦路。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"There's still time," Langdon ventured. "Tell me where the canister is. The Vatican will pay more than the Illuminati ever could."</div>

<div class="line_en">Waiting for what? The killer kept circling, a master at positioning himself. It was like an endless game of chess. The weapon in Langdon's hand was getting heavy, and he suddenly sensed he knew what the Hassassin was waiting for. He's tiring me out. It was working, too. Langdon was hit by a surge of weariness, the adrenaline alone no longer enough to keep him alert. He knew he had to make a move.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="等待什麽？杀手继续绕著圈子，维持完美的位置。这好像是个永无止境的棋戏。兰登觉得手上的武器愈来愈沉重，他猛然醒悟到哈撒辛在等什麽了。他要把我耗到筋疲力竭。这招的确有效。兰登觉得一股浓浓的倦意涌上来，光靠肾上腺素已经无法让他保持警觉。他知道自己得採取行动了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Langdon jabbed with the bar. The Hassassin dodged. He navigated around a bench, holding the weapon in front of him, trying to corner the Hassassin in the oval room. This damn room has no corners! Oddly, the Hassassin did not seem interested in attacking or fleeing. He was simply playing Langdon's game. Coolly waiting.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was not a weapon at all. The sight momentarily riveted him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那根本不是什麽武器。他一时间无法移开目光。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Langdon snapped his head back up, fearing the Hassassin would lunge. He did not. The killer was waiting, almost as if he were refreshed by the game. Langdon fought to recover his focus, locking eyes again with his quarry, thrusting with the pipe. But the image of the box hung in his mind. Although the brands themselves were mesmerizing -- artifacts few Illuminati scholars even believed existed -- Langdon suddenly realized there had been somethingelse about the box that had ignited a wave of foreboding within. As the Hassassin maneuvered again, Langdon stole another glance downward.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登赶紧把头转回来，担心哈撒辛会衝过来。结果没有。那个杀手等待著，这个游戏简直像是让他精神一振。兰登努力想重新集中注意力，目光再度盯紧眼前的目标，手上的铁管往前指著。但那个箱子的影像在他脑中缭绕不去，儘管那些烙印模本身就令人入迷──甚至没几个研究光明会的学者相信有这些东西的存在──兰登忽然明白那个箱子还有其他地方激起他心中强烈的不祥预感。当哈撒辛再度开始移动，兰登又偷偷往下望了一眼。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Hassassin seemed to read Langdon's mind, shifting again, as if intentionally leading Langdon toward a table in the middle of the room. Langdon could tell there was something on the table. Something glinted in the torchlight. A weapon? Langdon kept his eyes focused on the Hassassin and maneuvered himself closer to the table. When the Hassassin cast a long, guileless glance at the table, Langdon tried to fight the obvious bait. But instinct overruled. He stole a glance. The damage was done.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈撒辛似乎看透了兰登的想法，又开始改变方向，好像故意要将兰登引向房间中央的一张桌子去。兰登看得出桌上摆著东西，在火炬的照耀下闪著微光。是武器吗？兰登眼睛专注看著哈撒辛，同时设法靠近那张桌子。哈撒辛朝那桌子毫不保留地、久久地看了一眼，兰登努力不要中这个明显的圈套，但直觉却违背了他。他偷看一眼，已然铸成大错。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On the table lay a rudimentary copper chest, crusted with ancient patina. The chest was a pentagon. The lid lay open. Arranged inside in five padded compartments were five brands. The brands were forged of iron -- large embossing tools with stout handles of wood. Langdon had no doubt what they said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="桌上放著一个老旧的红铜箱子，外头蒙著一层古老的铜绿。箱子是五边形，盖子开著。裡头五个有衬垫的格子裡有五个烙印模。那些烙印模是铁铸的──很大的压印工具，连著粗大的木製把手。兰登毫不怀疑印出来会是什麽字。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In the chest, the five brands sat in compartments around the outer edge. But in thecenter, there was another compartment. This partition was empty, but it clearly was intended to hold another brand… a brand much larger than the others, and perfectly square.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在那个箱子裡，五个烙印模放在靠外的格子裡。而在中央，还有一个格子，裡头是空的，但显然是设计来放另一个烙印模的……比其他都要大得多，而且是正方形的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Langdon felt like he'd been hit by a cyclone. The Hassassin circled, smiling now, backing Langdon against the wall. "What is your Americanadàgio?" he chided. "Something about curiosity and the cat?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登觉得自己好像被飓风卷入。现在哈撒辛绕著他旋转，脸上带著微笑，逼著兰登退到墙边。「你们美国人的谚语是怎麽说来著？」他骂道。「好奇心会害死一隻猫？」">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Hassassin swooped toward him like a bird of prey. Langdon, his concentration having been masterfully diverted, tried to counter, but the pipe felt like a tree trunk in his hands. His parry was too slow. The Hassassin dodged. As Langdon tried to retract the bar, the Hassassin's hands shot out and grabbed it. The man's grip was strong, his injured arm seeming no longer to affect him. Violently, the two men struggled. Langdon felt the bar ripped away, and a searing pain shot through his palm. An instant later, Langdon was staring into the splintered point of the weapon. The hunter had become the hunted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈撒辛像隻猛禽般朝他扑过来。兰登已经迅速将注意力转回来，想要反击，但那根铁棒在手裡沉得就像根树干似的，他举起的动作太慢，哈撒辛避开了。兰登想再抽回那根铁棒，却被哈撒辛两手一伸抓住。那个人力气好大，受伤的手臂对他似乎毫无影响。两个人激烈打斗著。兰登觉得棒子被硬抽走了，整个手掌一阵剧痛。才一转眼间，兰登就只能直瞪著那根武器断裂的一端。猎人自己变成猎物了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Langdon could barely focus. He cursed his carelessness as the Hassassin moved in. Nothing was making sense. A sixth Illuminati brand? In frustration he blurted, "I've never read anything about asixth Illuminati brand!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登简直没法专心。当哈撒辛往前逼近时，兰登喃喃诅咒著自己的大意。一切都没道理。第六个光明会烙印？他困惑地衝口而出：「我从来没听说过有第六个光明会烙印。」">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Langdon sensed the killer was serious. Janus coming to Vatican City on asuicide mission? A question of honor? For an instant, Langdon's mind took in the entire terrifying cycle. The Illuminati plot had come full circle. The priest whom the Illuminati had inadvertently brought to power by killing the Pope had emerged as a worthy adversary. In a final act of defiance, the Illuminati leader would destroy him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登感觉到那个杀手不是在开玩笑。杰纳斯到梵蒂冈去执行一个自杀任务？一切关乎荣誉？一刹那间，兰登明白了整件事情可怕的来龙去脉了。光明会的计谋绕了一圈回到原点。光明会杀害了教宗，因而不经意让一名小小的神父冒出头来掌握大权，成了个强劲的敌手。在最后的对抗行动中，光明会领袖将亲自出马消灭他。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Langdon immediately sensed the precipice behind him -- a hundred-foot drop to the courtyard below. He had seen it on his way in. The Hassassin wasted no time. With a violent surge, he lunged. The spear sliced toward Langdon's midsection. Langdon skidded back, and the point came up short, catching only his shirt. Again the point came at him. Langdon slid farther back, feeling the banister right behind him. Certain the next jab would kill him, Langdon attempted the absurd. Spinning to one side, he reached out and grabbed the shaft, sending a jolt of pain through his palm. Langdon held on.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登立刻感觉到身后的悬崖──离下方的庭院有一百迟，他进入城堡的时候看到过。哈撒辛不再浪费时间，猛然往前扑过来。手中的铁棒朝兰登的腹部挥去。兰登往后一闪，棒子差了一点，只扫到他的高领衫。那根铁棒再度朝他刺过来，兰登往后退得更远，感觉到栏杆就贴在他后头。兰登知道杀手再刺过来，他就死定了，于是他尝试了荒谬的一招。他侧过身子，伸手去抓铁棒，一股剧痛透遍整个手掌。兰登抓住了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">With a merciless glare, the Hassassin gave a final shove. Langdon's center of gravity shifted, and his feet swung up off the floor. With only one hope of survival, Langdon grabbed on to the railing as he went over. His left hand slipped, but his right hand held on. He ended up hanging upside down by his legs and one hand… straining to hold on.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈撒辛无情地瞪著兰登，推了他最后一把。兰登的重心转移，双脚朝上晃离了地。往后翻倒过去时，求生意志促使他去抓栏杆。他的左手滑掉，但右手却抓住了。于是他上下倒悬在那裡，就靠双腿和一隻手……拼命要撑在栏杆上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Hassassin's arms exploded upward, driving Langdon back against the railing. Langdon sensed nothing but empty space behind him as the railing hit just beneath his buttocks. The Hassassin held the bar crosswise and drove it into Langdon's chest. Langdon's back arched over the chasm.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈撒辛猛地举起双手，把兰登推向栏杆。兰登臀部撞上栏杆时，感觉到下头除了一片空无什麽都没有。哈撒辛横抓著铁棒猛压兰登的胸口。兰登的背朝后弯向底下的深渊。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Hassassin seemed unfazed. They strained for a moment against one another, face to face, the Hassassin's breath fetid in Langdon's nostrils. The bar began to slip. The Hassassin was too strong. In a final act of desperation, Langdon stretched out his leg, dangerously off balance as he tried to ram his foot down on the Hassassin's injured toe. But the man was a professional and adjusted to protect his weakness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈撒辛似乎无动于衷，两个人彼此僵持了一会儿，面对面，兰登闻得到哈撒辛呼吸中的臭味。那根棒子开始滑出手心，哈撒辛太壮了。绝望之馀，兰登伸出一腿，冒著失去平衡的危险，想踩哈撒辛那根受伤的脚趾。但哈撒辛是个专业好手，很快就调整姿势保护自己的弱点。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The iron bar clattered past Langdon out into the night. The Hassassin spun away from him, and Langdon saw a blistering torch burn on the killer's back. Langdon pulled himself up to see Vittoria, eyes flaring, now facing the Hassassin.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那根铁棒飞过兰登身边，哗地一声没入夜色中。哈撒辛猛转回身，兰登看到杀手的背上被火炬燎出一片水泡。兰登撑起身子看到了薇多利雅，正眼神炯炯面对著哈撒辛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Looming over him, the Hassassin raised the bar overhead, preparing to bring it crashing down. As the bar began to accelerate, Langdon saw a vision. Perhaps it was the imminence of death or simply blind fear, but in that moment, he sensed a sudden aura surrounding the Hassassin. A glowing effulgence seemed to swell out of nothing behind him… like an incoming fireball.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈撒辛从他上方冒出来，铁棒高举过头，准备要往下砸。铁棒即将落下时，兰登看到了一个幻影，也许是死神逼近，或只是盲目的恐惧，但在那一刻，他感觉到忽然一股灵气环绕著哈撒辛。一道强光彷彿平空从他背后冒出来……像一颗飞过来的火球。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Vittoria waved a torch in front of her, the vengeance in her face resplendent in the flames. How she had escaped, Langdon did not know or care. He began scrambling back up over the banister.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="薇多利雅拿著火炬在面前挥，火光照著她那一脸复仇的表情。兰登不懂她是怎麽脱身的，但也不在乎。他开始挣扎著往上爬，翻过了栏杆。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The battle would be short. The Hassassin was a deadly match. Screaming with rage, the killer lunged for her. She tried to dodge, but the man was on her, holding the torch and about to wrestle it away. Langdon did not wait. Leaping off the banister, Langdon jabbed his clenched fist into the blistered burn on the Hassassin's back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这场打斗不会耗太久，哈撒辛是个太可怕的对手，他愤怒大吼，朝薇多利雅扑过去。她还来不及躲，就被制住了，杀手抓住火炬，正要逼薇多利雅甩掉。兰登没浪费时间，他一跳下栏杆，就握紧拳头捶向哈撒辛背后那片遍佈水泡的灼伤。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Hassassin froze a moment, his back arched in anguish. He let go of the torch, and Vittoria thrust it hard into his face. There was a hiss of flesh as his left eye sizzled. He screamed again, raising his hands to his face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈撒辛僵住了片刻，痛苦地背朝后拱。他鬆开火炬，薇多利雅拿著往他脸上用力戳。火炬刺入他的左眼时，发出肉类烧炙的嘶嘶声。他再度大喊，举起双手护著脸。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Eye for an eye," Vittoria hissed. This time she swung the torch like a bat, and when it connected, the Hassassin stumbled back against the railing. Langdon and Vittoria went for him at the same instant, both heaving and pushing. The Hassassin's body sailed backward over the banister into the night. There was no scream. The only sound was the crack of his spine as he landed spread-eagle on a pile of cannonballs far below.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="「以眼还眼。」薇多利雅咬牙说。这回她手上的火炬像球棒般挥出，把哈撒辛击得踉跄后退到栏杆边。兰登和薇多利雅同时往前，把他抬起来推下去。哈撒辛的身体越过栏杆往后飞，消失在夜色中。这回他没喊，当他以大鹰展翅的姿势掉到下头一堆圆石弹上，唯一发出的就是脊椎摔碎的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>
