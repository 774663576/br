<div class="line_en">The Littles had a grand piano in their living room, which was all right except that one of the keys was a sticky key and didn't work properly. Mrs. Little said she thought it must be the damp weather, but I don't see how it could be the damp weather, for the key had been sticking for about four years, during which time there had been many bright clear days. But anyway, the key stuck, and was a great inconvenience to anyone trying to play the piano. It bothered George particularly when he was playing the "Scarf Dance," which was rather lively. It was George who had the idea of stationing Stuart inside the piano to push the key up the second it was played. This was no easy job for Stuart, as he had to crouch down between the felt hammers so that he wouldn't get hit on the head. But Stuart liked it just the same: it was exciting inside the piano, dodging about, and the noise was quite terrific. Sometimes after a long session he would emerge quite deaf, as though he had just stepped out of an airplane after a long journey; and it would be some little time before he really felt normal again.</div>

<div class="line_en">Stuart was also helpful when it came to Ping-pong. The Littles liked Ping-pong, but the balls had a way of rolling under chairs, sofas, and radiators, and this meant that the players were forever stooping down and reaching under things. Stuart soon learned to chase balls, and it was a great sight to see him come out from under a hot radiator, pushing a Ping-pong ball with all his might, the perspiration rolling down his cheeks. The ball, of course, was almost as high as he was, and he had to throw his whole weight against it in order to keep it rolling.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯图亚特在打乒乓球时的用处也很大。利特尔一家人喜欢打乒乓球，可是球总会滚到椅子、沙发、暖气炉的下面，这时打球的人就总要弯腰钻到这些地方的下面去拣球。斯图亚特不久就学会了拣球。很多次，你都能看到他热汗淋漓地从暖气炉底下把一个乒乓球用尽全力推出来的样子。当然了，这个球几乎和他一样高，为了让它往前滚，他不得不把身上的最后一丝力气都使出来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes," replied Mrs. Little, "and I think we had better start thinking about the poem ''Twas the night before Christmas when all through the house not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.' I think it might embarrass Stuart to hear mice mentioned in such a belittling manner."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，”利特尔太太回答，“我想我们也应该想到那首诗：”这是圣诞的前夜，房子里没有一个动物在乱跑，甚至是一只老鼠。‘我想斯图亚特要是听到有人用这么轻蔑的口气来说老鼠，他可能会感到很窘的。’”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mr. and Mrs. Little often discussed Stuart quietly between themselves when he wasn't around, for they had never quite recovered from the shock and surprise of having a mouse in the family. He was so very tiny and he presented so many problems to his parents. Mr. Little said that, for one thing, there must be no references to "mice" in their conversation. He made Mrs. Little tear from the nursery songbook the page about the "Three Blind Mice, See How They Run."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="利特尔先生和太太在斯图亚特不在场时总是在悄悄地谈论他，因为他们从未从家里有了一只老鼠的震动与惊奇中恢复过来。他是这么小，而且还给他的父母带来了这么多的问题。利特尔先生说，首先，在他们的谈话中不许再用“老鼠”这个词。他还让利特尔太太从儿歌书里把写有“三只瞎老鼠，看他们怎样跑”字样的这一页撕下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I don't want Stuart to get a lot of notions in his head," said Mr. Little. "I should feel badly to have my son grow up fearing that a farmer's wife was going to cut off his tail with a carving knife. It is such things that make children dream bad dreams when they go to bed at night."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不想让斯图亚特因此而想得太多，”利特尔先生说。“如果我的儿子长大以后害怕会有一个农夫的妻子来用切肉刀把他的尾巴割下来，我会很难过的。这念头会使在夜里睡着的孩子做噩梦的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was decided that louse was the best substitute for mouse, and so when Christmas came around Mrs. Little carefully rubbed out the word mouse from the poem and wrote in the word louse, and Stuart always thought that the poem went this way:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="决定了“虱子”是最合适的替代老鼠的词以后，当圣诞节来到时，利特尔太太便小心地把“老鼠”那个词从诗里抹掉，改写为“虱子”，于是斯图亚特就总以为那句诗是这么说的：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That's right," said her husband, "but what shall we say when we come to that line in the poem? We'll have to say something. We can't just say ''Twas the night before Christmas when all through the house not a creature was stirring.' That doesn't sound complete; it needs a word to rhyme with house."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“就是，”她的丈夫说，“可是当我们读到这一行诗时，该怎么说呢？我们不得不说些什么吧。我们不能只说‘这是圣诞的前夜，房子里没有一个动物在乱跑’吧，那样听起来就不完整了；那时就需要说一个能与‘房子’押韵的词。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The thing that worried Mr. Little most was the mousehole in the pantry. This hole had been made by some mice in the days before the Littles came to live in the house, and nothing had been done about stopping it up. Mr. Little was not at all sure that he understood Stuart's real feeling about a mousehole. He didn't know where the hole led to, and it made him uneasy to think that Stuart might some day feel the desire to venture into it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最使利特尔太太担心的还是食品贮藏室里的那个耗子洞。这个洞在利特尔一家搬来这里住之前就有了，而且没人想过把它堵上。利特尔先生根本不知道斯图亚特对那个老鼠洞是怎么看的。他不知道那个洞会通到哪里，而且一想到斯图亚特有一天可能会想进那里面去探险，他心里就特别的不舒服。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I suggest souse," remarked George, who had been listening to the conversation from across the room.</div>
