<div class="line_en">Harry was several streets away before he collapsed onto a low wall in Magnolia Crescent, panting from the effort of dragging his trunk. He sat quite still, anger still surging through him, listening to the frantic thumping of his heart.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利瘫坐在木兰花新月街的一道矮墙上的时候，他已经离家有几条街了，由于拖着箱子，累得气喘吁吁。他很安静地坐着，满腔怒气仍然没有平息，心脏还在猛烈地跳动。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But after ten minutes alone in the dark street, a new emotion overtook him: panic. Whichever way he looked at it, he had never been in a worse fix. He was stranded, quite alone, in the dark Muggle world, with absolutely nowhere to go. And the worst of it was, he had just done serious magic, which meant that he was almost certainly expelled from Hogwarts. He had broken the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry so badly, he was surprised Ministry of Magic representatives weren't swooping down on him where he sat.</div>

<div class="line_en">What, was going to happen to him? Would he be arrested, or would he simply be outlawed from the wizarding world? He thought of Ron and Hermione, and his heart sank even lower.

<div class="line_en">He didn't have any Muggle money, either. There was a little wizard gold in the money bag at the bottom of his trunk, but the rest of the fortune his parents had left him was stored in a vault at Gringotts Wizarding Bank in London. He'd never be able to drag his trunk all the way to London. Unless…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他身上也没有麻瓜通用的钱。在他的衣箱底的钱袋里，有一点儿魔法界的黄金，但他父母留给他的其余财产都在古灵阁魔法银行的地下金库里。他可不能一路拖着衣箱上伦敦。除非…">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He looked down at his wand, which he was still clutching in his hand. If he was already expelled (his heart was. now thumping painfully fast), a bit more magic couldn't hurt. He had the Invisibility Cloak he had inherited from his father -- what if he bewitched the trunk to make it feather-light, tied it to his broomstick, covered himself in the cloak, and flew to London? Then he could get the rest of his money out of his vault and… begin his life as an outcast. It was a horrible prospect, but he couldn't sit on this wall forever, or he'd find himself trying to explain to Muggle police why he was out in the dead of night with a trunkful of spellbooks and a broomstick.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他低头看看魔杖，魔杖还被他抓在手里。如果他已经被开除了（想到这一点，他的心脏就痛苦地快速跳动），再施展一点魔法也不妨事。他有爸爸留给他的隐形衣——如果他对衣箱施展魔法，让衣箱变得轻如鸿毛，把衣箱捆在飞天扫帚上，自己再穿上隐形衣飞到伦敦去，那又怎么样？然后他可以从地下金库里取出其余的钱，然后他去流浪。这样的前景非常可怕，但他总不能老是坐在这道矮墙上啊，要不然他就不得不向麻瓜的警察解释他为什么深更半夜还待在大街上，带着一个箱子、咒语书和一把飞天扫帚。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry stepped backward. His legs hit his trunk and he tripped. His wand flew out of his hand as he flung out an arm to break his fall, and he landed, hard, in the gutter --</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利向后退去。他的腿碰到了衣箱，绊了一下。他伸出一条手臂以保持身体平衡，这时，魔杖从他手里飞了出去，他摔到了街沟里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Lumos," Harry muttered, and a light appeared at the end of his wand, almost dazzling him. He held it high over his head, and the pebble-dashed walls of number two suddenly sparkled; the garage door gleamed, and between them Harry saw, quite distinctly, the hulking outline of something very big, with wide, gleaming eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“荧光闪烁，”哈利轻声低语道，于是他的魔杖末端发出一道光来，他几乎感到眩晕了。他把魔杖高举过头，布满砾石的二号墙体忽然闪烁着亮光；车库的门发出微光，在这两者之间，哈利清楚地看到，一个很大的、有着发微光大眼睛的什么东西的庞大轮廓。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A funny prickling on the back of his neck had made Harry feel he was being watched, but the street appeared to be deserted, and no lights shone from any of the large square houses.</div>

<div class="line_en">He bent over his trunk again, but almost immediately stood up once more, his hand clenched on his wand. He had sensed rather than heard it: someone or something was standing in the narrow gap between the garage and the fence behind him. Harry squinted at the black alleyway. If only it would move, then he'd know whether it was just a stray cat or -- something else.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利又俯身向着衣箱，但他几乎又马上站直了身子，他的手抓紧了魔杖。与其说他听到了什么，还不如说他感觉到了什么：有什么人或什么东西站在他身后的篱笆和车库之间的狭小空间里。哈利斜眼看看那条黑暗的胡同。只要那东西会动，哈利就会知道这只不过是一头迷路的猫还是——别的什么。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">With a yell, he rolled back onto the pavement, just in time. A second later, a gigantic pair of wheels and headlights screeched to a halt exactly where Harry had just been lying. They belonged, as Harry saw when he raised his head, to a triple-decker, violently purple bus, which had appeared out of thin air. Gold lettering over the windshield spelled The Knight Bus.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利大叫一声，滚回到人行道上，非常及时。一秒钟以后，一对巨大的车轮和车灯尖叫着恰恰在哈利刚才躺着的地方刹住了。哈利抬起头来，发现这车轮和车灯属于一辆三层的公共汽车，这辆汽车是从稀薄的空气里出现的。汽车挡风玻璃上的金色字母组成了这样几个字：骑士公共汽车。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The conductor stopped abruptly. He had just caught sight of "Harry, who was still sitting on the ground. Harry snatched up his wand again and scrambled to his feet. Close up, he saw that Stan Shunpike was only a few years older than he was, eighteen or nineteen at most, with large, protruding ears and quite a few pimples.</div>

<div class="line_en">For a Split second, Harry wondered if he had been knocked silly by his fall. Then a conductor in a purple uniform leapt out of the bus and began to speak loudly to the night.</div>

He suddenly remembered why he had fallen over and turned around quickly to stare at the alleyway between the garage and fence. The Knight Bus's headlamps were flooding it with light, and it was empty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不是故意要摔的。”哈利说，不觉着恼了。他的牛仔裤有一条裤腿撕破了，他伸出去以保持身体平衡的那只手在流血。他突然记起他为什么会摔倒，于是他转过身去，瞪着汽车库与篱笆之间的那条胡同。骑士公共汽车的头灯将那里照亮了，那里空荡荡的。">查看中文翻译</div>

Candles were burning in brackets beside each bed, illuminating the wood-paneled walls.
