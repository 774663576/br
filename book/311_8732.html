<div class="line_en">"It's okay, Mindy," Park's dad said softly from the doorway. "Come to bed, honey." He walked over to the bed and helped Park's mom up, then stood with his arm wrapped protectively around her. "Your mom just wants you to be happy," he said to Park. "Don't puss out on our account."</div>

<div class="line_en">He knew which room was Eleanor's. She'd told him once that she slept by the window, and he knew she had the top bunk.

<div class="line_en">He ran to her -- and took her face in both of his hands. And then he was kissing her before she could say no.
