<div class="line_en">As he came from Earth now, above the clouds and in close formation with the two brilliant gulls, he saw that his own body was growing as bright as theirs. True, the same young Jonathan Seagull was there that had always lived behind his golden eyes, but the outer form had changed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他从尘世飞升来到这里，与这两只光辉的海鸥紧紧排成行列。一同穿过云层。这会儿他发现自己的身体也和他们一样变成晶莹的了。的确，他的生活一向比他的金色眼睛看到的要更丰富，但还是这个年轻的乔纳森，现在连外貌也改变啦。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So this is heaven, he thought, and he had to smile at himself. It was hardly respectful to analyze heaven in the very moment that one flies up to enter it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="原来这就是天堂，他心里想，不禁暗自好笑。一飞过天堂，马上就对它进行猜度，似乎太不尊敬了">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His feathers glowed brilliant white now, and his wings were smooth and perfect as sheets of polished silver. He began, delightedly, to learn about them, to press power into these new wings.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在他的羽毛闪着灿烂的白光，双翅像磨光的银片那样平滑、完美。他满心喜悦，开始揣摩自己翅膀的功能，要把力量使到这一对新的翅膀上去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At two hundred fifty miles per hour he felt that he was nearing his level-flight maximum speed. At two hundred seventy-three he thought that he was flying as fast as he could fly, and he was ever so faintly disappointed. There was a limit to how much the new body could do, and though it was much faster than his old level-flight record, it was still a limit that would take great effort to crack. In heaven, he thought, there should be no limits.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到了时速二百五十英里，他觉得已经接近水平飞行的最高速度。到了时速二百七十三英里，他认为已经决得不能再快了。他不免略微有点失望。想不到这个新躯体也会有力所不能及。尽管已经远远超过了过去的水平飞行纪录，但毕竟还是有限的速度，要超出过限度，还得再花一番功夫。他想，在天堂，应当什么都是无限的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It felt like a seagull body, but alreadv it flew far better than his old one had ever flown. Why, with half the effort, he thought, I'll get twice the speed, twice the performance of my best days on Earth!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="身上的感觉还像只海鸥，但飞起来已和过去大不相同。他想：真怪，只要费一半力气，我的速度就比过去快了一倍。我的成就比在尘世最美好的日子翻了一番。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He was flying over a sea, toward a jagged shoreline. A very few seagulls were working the updrafts on the cliffs. Away off to the north, at the horizon itself, flew a few others. New sights, new thoughts, new questions. Why so few gulls? Heaven should be flocked with gulls! And why am I so tired, all at once? Gulls in heaven are never supposed to be tired, or to sleep.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他越过一片大海，向弯弯曲曲的海岸线飞去。海边峭壁上，寥寥几只海鸥正在向上奋飞。北方远处，在地平线上，另有几只海鸥在翱翔。新的景象，新的思想，新的问题。为什么只有这么几只海鸥？天堂里应该到处是鸥群才是！我怎么一下子感到这样累？天堂里的海鸥应该永远不感到累，也永远不睡觉才是。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The dozen gulls by the shoreline came to meet him, none saying a word. He felt only that he was welcome and that this was home. It had been a big day for him, a day whose sunrise he no longer remembered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="岸边有十几只海鸥飞过来迎接他，但谁都没吭声。他只觉得自己受到了欢迎，这儿是他的家。这天是他的一个重要日子，不过他已经记不得这天的黎明是什么时候开始的了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The clouds broke apart, his escorts called, "Happy landings, Jonathan," and vanished into thin air.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="云散了，他的向导们喊了声“祝你顺利着陆，乔纳森！”就消失在稀薄的大气中">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Where had he heard that? The memory of his life on Earth was falling away. Earth had been a place where he had learned much, of course, but the details were blurred -- something about fighting for food, and being Outcast.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他从哪儿听到过这一切的？他对尘世生活的记忆已经开始淡薄了。当然，在尘世那个地方，他学会了不少东西，不过一切细节已经很模糊了——又仿佛记得为觅食而飞行，自己成了弃儿。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He turned to land on the beach, beating his wings to stop an inch in the air, then dropping lightly to the sand, The other gulls landed too, but not one of them so much as flapped a feather. They swung into the wind, bright wings outstretched, then somehow they changed the curve of their feathers until they had stopped in the same instant their feet touched the ground. It was beautiful control, but now Jonathan was just too tired to try it. Standing there on the beach, still without a word spoken, he was asleep.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他转身准备在海滩上着陆，先挥动两翼，在空中停口片刻，然后轻轻落在沙滩上。其他海鸥也降落下来，但他们中间谁也没有挥动一根羽毛。他们迎风飞翔，展开亮晶晶的翅膀，后来不知怎的把羽毛的弯曲度一变，就降落下来，同时两脚着地。掌握得真是太棒了。但乔纳森这时实在太累，一点也不想跟着学了。他站在沙滩上，依旧一声不吭，一会儿就睡着了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For a long time Jonathan forgot about the world that he had come from, that place where the Flock lived with its eyes tightly shut to the joy of flight, using its wings as means to the end of finding and fighting for food. But now and then, just for a moment, he remembered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有很长的一段时间，乔纳森忘掉了他来自的那个世界，忘掉了那个鸥群栖居的地方，忘掉了他的那些同胞，他们看不到飞行的乐趣，只知道把双翅当作寻找和争夺食物的工具。但偶尔他也想起过去，虽然只是片刻工夫。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the days that followed, Jonathan saw that there was as much to learn about flight in this place as there had been in the life behind him. But with a difference. Here were gulls who thought as he thought, for each of them, the most important thing in living was to reach out and touch perfection in that which they most loved to do, and that was to fly. They were magnificent birds, all of them, and they spent hour after hour every day practicing flight, testing advanced aeronautics.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="以后几天，乔纳森发现，这里也和他过去那段生活一样，在飞行方面有不少东西要学。所不同的是，这里的海鸥与他有共同的思想。对他们每一个来说，生活中最重要的一点，就是尽量发挥自己的潜能，把最喜欢的事做得尽善尽美，那就是飞行。他们全是了不起的鸟儿，每天无时无刻不在练习飞行，试验各种高级特技。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Where is everybody, Sullivan?" he asked silently, quite at home now with the easy telepathy that these gulls used instead of screes and gracks. "Why aren't there more of us here? Why, where I came from there were…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他们都在哪儿呢，苏利万？”他不出声地问。现在他已经习惯了这些海鸥以心传心的简便交谈方式，用不着尖声嚎叫了。“为什么没有我们更多的同胞在这儿？呃，在我的家乡，有……”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"… thousands and thousands of gulls. I know." Sullivan shook his head. "The only answer I can see, Jonathan, is that you are pretty well a one-in-a-million bird. Most of us came along ever so slowly. We went from one world into another that was almost exactly like it, forgetting right away where we had come from, not caring where we were headed, living for the moment. Do you have any idea how many lives we must have gone through before we even got the first idea that there is more to life than eating, or fighting, or power in the Flock? A thousand lives, Jon, ten thousand! And then another hundred lives until we began to learn that there is such a thing as perfection, and another hundred again to get the idea that our purpose for living is to find that perfection and show it forth. The same rule holds for us now, of course: we choose our next world through what we learn in this one. Learn nothing, and the next world is the same as this one, all the same limitations and lead weights to overcome."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“……有成千上万只海鸥。我知道。”苏利万摇了摇头。“我能想到的唯一答案，乔纳森，就是你是万里挑一的好鸟儿。我们中间大多数都学得太慢。我们从一个世界进入另一个几乎完全相同的世界，马上就忘了我们是从哪儿来的，也不在乎我们要往哪儿去，只想到现在活着的这一刻。你知道不知道，要领悟生活中有比吃喝、打架、争夺权势更重要的事，我们得经历多少世吗？乔，要经过千世、万世呢！然后再经过百世，才能领悟世上有所谓“尽善尽美”。然后，再经过百世，才能认识到我们生活的目的是去寻找尽善尽美并使之实现。当然啦，这个规律现在还对我们适用：我们是根据这个世界上学到的东西去选择另一个世界的。如果学不到什么，那么另一个世界也会像这个世界一样，你会遇到同样的局限和困难。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He stretched his wings and turned to face the wind. "But you, Jon," he said, "learned so much at one time that you didn't have to go through a thousand lives to reach this one."</div>

<div class="line_en">The old seagull looked at him kindly. "Yes, my son?" Instead of being enfeebled by age, the Elder had been empowered by it; he could outfly any gull in the Flock, and he had learned skills that the others were only gradually coming to know.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这只老海鸥慈祥地望着他。“嗯，我的孩子！”年龄并没使长者衰弱，反而使他更有力量了，他能比鸥群中任何一个都飞得快，他学会的本领，其他海鸥还只能一点一滴地慢慢理解呢。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In a moment they were airborne again, practicing. The formation point-roils were difficult, for through the inverted half Jonathan had to think upside down, reversing the curve of his wing, and reversing it exactly in harmony with his instructor's.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一会儿，他们又在天空练习飞行了。列队定点翻滚是很难学的，因为在倒转时，乔纳森得头朝下、脚朝上倒过身子思考问题，同时还要把翅膀倒弯过来，而且要弯得恰到好处，倒好与他的导师一致。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One evening the gulls that were not night-flying stood together on the sand, thinking. Jonathan took all his courage in hand and walked to the Elder Gull, who, it was said, was soon to be moving beyond this world. "Chiang…" he said a little nervously.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一天傍晚，那些没去夜间飞行的海鸥都一起站在沙滩上默默沉思。乔纳森鼓起勇气，走到海鸥长者跟前，据说这只海鸥不久就要离开这个世界了。“江……”他开口了，有点紧张。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Let's try it again." Sullivan said over and over: "Let's try it again." Then, finally, "Good." And they began practicing outside loops.</div>

<div class="line_en">"No, Jonathan, there is no such place. Heaven is not a place, and it is not a time. Heaven is being perfect." He was silent for a moment. "You are a very fast flier, aren't you?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“对，乔纳森，没有这么个地方。天堂不是空间，也不是时间。天堂就是尽善尽美。”他沉默了片刻。“你飞得很快，对不对？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Without warning, Chiang vanished and appeared at the water's edge fifty feet away, all in the flicker of an instant. Then he vanished again and stood, in the same millisecond, at Jonathan's shoulder. "It's kind of fun," he said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="江一点不露声色，一闪身就不见了，跟着就在五十英尺以外的水边出现，就那么一刹那工夫。跟着他又不见了，不到千分之一秒，他又站在乔纳森肩旁。“这是闹着玩儿。”他说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jonathan was dazzled. He forgot to ask about heaven. "How do you do that? What does it feel like? How far can you go?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="乔纳森有点晕头转向了。他都忘了打听天堂。“你怎么作的？有什么感觉？你能飞多远？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You will begin to touch heaven, Jonathan, in the moment that you touch perfect speed. And that isn't flying a thousand miles an hour, or a million, or flying at the speed of light. Because any number is a limit, and perfection doesn't have limits. Perfect speed, my son, is being there."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“乔纳森，你一达到尽善尽美的速度，也就开始到达了天堂。那并不是说飞行的速度要达到一千英里，或者一百万英里，或者达到光速。因为任何数字都是有限的、而尽善尽美是无限的。尽善尽美的速度，孩子，就是要那样。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You can go to any place and to any time that you wish to go," the Elder said. "I've gone everywhere and every when I can think of." He looked across the sea. "It's strange. The gulls who scorn perfection for the sake of travel go nowhere, slowly. Those who put aside travel for the sake of perfection go anywhere, instantly. Remember, Jonathan, heaven isn't a place or a time, because place and time are so very meaningless. Heaven is…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你想飞多远、多快，都随你的便。”长者说，“我想去哪儿，想飞多快，只要一转念就成。”他向大海彼岸望去。“真奇怪。那些藐视尽善尽美，光想旅行的海鸥，速度极慢，哪儿也去不成。而那些把旅行置之度外，只求达到尽善尽美的海鸥，却速度极快，想去哪儿就去哪儿。记住，乔纳森，天堂不是时间也不是空间，因为时间和空间都是那么没有意义。天堂是……”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The trick, according to Chiang, was for Jonathan to stop seeing himself as trapped inside a limited body that had a forty-two inch wingspan and performance that could be plotted on a chart. The trick was to know that his true nature lived, as perfect as an unwritten number, everywhere at once across space and time.</div>

<div class="line_en">As the days went past, Jonathan found himself thinking time and again of the Earth from which he had come. If he had known there just a tenth, just a hundredth, of what he knew here, how much more life would have meant! He stood on the sand and fell to wondering if there was a gull back there who might be struggling to break out of his limits, to see the meaning of flight beyond a way of travel to get a breadcrumb from a rowboat. Perhaps there might even have been one made Outcast for speaking his truth in the face of the Flock. And the more Jonathan practiced his kindness lessons, and the more he worked to know the nature of love, the more he wanted to go back to Earth. For in spite of his lonely past, Jonathan Seagull was born to be an instructor, and his own way of demonstrating love was to give something of the truth that he had seen to a gull who asked only a chance to see truth for himself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="光阴荏苒，乔纳森发现自己不时思念他所离开的尘世。如果他过去能懂得现在所懂得的哪怕十分之一、百分之一，那么生活的意义该丰富多少倍啊！他站在沙滩上，沉入了遐想：在那里会不会也有那么一只海鸥，正在奋力冲破自身的局限，正在努力探索飞行的意义，看出飞行不光是为了从小船上弄点面包屑吃。“说不定，也会有那么一只海鸥因为对鸥群讲出了真理，结果成了弃儿。乔纳森越是进修他的仁慈学课程，越是努力去理解爱的本质，他就越想返回尘世。尽管他往日的生活十分孤苦，他却是天生的导师，而他表示爱的唯一方式，就是把他所了解到的真理、去告诉一只希望有机会亲自了解真理的海鸥。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Jon, you were Outcast once. Why do you think that any of the gulls in your old time would listen to you now? You know the proverb, and it's true: The gull sees farthest who flies highest. Those gulls where you came from are standing on the ground, squawking and fighting among themselves. They're a thousand miles from heaven -- and you say you want to show them heaven from where they stand! Jon, they can't see their own wingtips! Stay here. Help the new gulls here, the ones who are high enough to see what you have to tell them." He was quiet for a moment, and then he said, "What if Chiang had gone back to his old worlds? Where would you have been today?"</div>

But the old feeling came back, and he couldn't help but think that there might be one or two gulls back on Earth who would be able to learn, too. How much more would he have known by now if Chiang had come to him on the day that he was Outcast!</div>

If our friendship depends on things like space and time, then when we finally overcome space and time, we've destroyed our own brotherhood! But overcome space, and all we have left is Here.
