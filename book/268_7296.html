<div class="line_en">In my dream it was very dark, and what dim light there was seemed to be radiating from Edward's skin. I couldn't see his face, just his back as he walked away from me, leaving me in the blackness. No matter how fast I ran, I couldn't catch up to him; no matter how loud I called, he never turned. Troubled, I woke in the middle of the night and couldn't sleep again for what seemed like a very long time. After that, he was in my dreams nearly every night, but always on the periphery, never within reach.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="梦里，很黑，惟一的一点儿昏暗的光，似乎是爱德华的皮肤发出来的。我看不见他的脸，只能看见他的背影，他正离我而去，把我留在了黑暗之中。不管我跑多快，总也追不上他；不管喊多大的声，他也不回头。一急，我半夜的时候醒了，似乎有好长一段时间硬是再也睡不着。打这以后，差不多每天夜里他都会出现在我的梦里，但他总在我碰触不到的外围，永远都是近在咫尺又遥不可及。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">To my dismay, I found myself the center of attention for the rest of that week. Tyler Crowley was impossible, following me around, obsessed with making amends to me somehow. I tried to convince him what I wanted more than anything else was for him to forget all about it -- especially since nothing had actually happened to me -- but he remained insistent. He followed me between classes and sat at our now-crowded lunch table. Mike and Eric were even less friendly toward him than they were to each other, which made me worry that I'd gained another unwelcome fan.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="令我感到郁闷的是，我发现自己成了后半周大家关注的中心。泰勒·克劳利真让人受不了，成天跟着我转，老想着怎么补偿我。我努力让他相信我最想要的就是，他把这件事统统忘掉——尤其是，实际上他根本就没给我带来任何伤害——可他就是一根筋儿地坚持。他课间跟着我，吃午饭也挤到我们现在已经很拥挤的桌子上来凑热闹。迈克和埃里克对他的敌意，甚至超过了他们彼此间的敌意，弄得我很担心自己又多了一个不受欢迎的粉丝。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">No one seemed concerned about Edward, though I explained over and over that he was the hero -- how he had pulled me out of the way and had nearly been crushed, too. I tried to be convincing. Jessica, Mike, Eric, and everyone else always commented that they hadn't even seen him there till the van was pulled away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="似乎谁也不关心爱德华，尽管我有一遍无一遍地解释说他是英雄——还解释了他把我拉开的过程以及差点儿让车给辗了的情形。我使尽了浑身解数，力图描述得可信一点。可杰西卡、迈克、埃里克以及其他所有人总是说他们在客货两用车拉走之前，连看都没有看到他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Edward was never surrounded by crowds of curious bystanders eager for his firsthand account. People avoided him as usual. The Cullens and the Hales sat at the same table as always, not eating, talking only among themselves. None of them, especially Edward, glanced my way anymore.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱德华身边从来没有好奇的旁观者围着，想听他的第一手描述。人们还是像往常一样对他敬而远之。卡伦兄妹仨和黑尔姐弟俩依旧坐在那张桌子上，不吃东西，只是他们几个之间相互聊天。他们谁都不瞟我这边一眼了，尤其是爱德华。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I wondered to myself why no one else had seen him standing so far away, before he was suddenly, impossibly saving my life. With chagrin, I realized the probable cause -- no one else was as aware of Edward as I always was. No one else watched him the way I did. How pitiful.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我暗自纳闷，为什么别人谁都没有看见在他突然难以置信地救了我的命之前，他站在那么老远的地方呢。我懊恼地意识到了一个可能的原因——别人谁都不像我那样总是在注意爱德华。别人谁都不曾像我那样注视过他。真是可怜啦。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When he sat next to me in class, as far from me as the table would allow, he seemed totally unaware of my presence. Only now and then, when his fists would suddenly ball up -- skin stretched even whiter over the bones -- did I wonder if he wasn't quite as oblivious as he appeared.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="上课他坐在我旁边时，也是能离我多远就离多远，似乎根本就不知道我的存在。只是偶尔他突然攥紧拳头，青筋暴露，皮肤更白了的时候，我才会怀疑他是不是不像看上去的那样健忘。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I wanted very much to talk to him, and the day after the accident I tried. The last time I'd seen him, outside the ER, we'd both been so furious. I still was angry that he wouldn't trust me with the truth, even though I was keeping my part of the bargain flawlessly. But he had in fact saved my life, no matter how he'd done it. And, overnight, the heat of my anger faded into awed gratitude.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我很想跟他谈谈，而且事故发生的当天我就试过了。我最后一次见到他的时候，在急救室的外面，我俩都是那样的愤怒。即使我一直说到做到，无可挑剔，可他还是不信任我，不告诉我真相，这一点我依然很生气。不过他确实救过我一条命，无论他是怎样救的。一夜过后，我的火气消了不说，还生出了肃然的感激之情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He wished he hadn't pulled me from the path of Tyler's van -- there was no other conclusion I could come to.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他很后悔当初不该把我从泰勒的客货两用车前面拉开——除此，我得不出任何别的结论。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was already seated when I got to Biology, looking straight ahead. I sat down, expecting him to turn toward me. He showed no sign that he realized I was there.</div>

<div class="line_en">And that was the last contact I'd had with him, though he was there, a foot away from me, every day. I watched him sometimes, unable to stop myself -- from a distance, though, in the cafeteria or parking lot. I watched as his golden eyes grew perceptibly darker day by day. But in class I gave no more notice that he existed than he showed toward me. I was miserable. And the dreams continued.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那便是我跟他的最后一次接触，虽然他每天都坐在我旁边，距我仅咫尺之遥。不过，有时在自助餐厅或停车场，我还是会情不自禁地从远处注视他。我注意到他金色的双眸明显地一天比一天暗了。但上课的时候，我也不太注意他的存在，他注意我多少，我就注意他多少，决不比他多。我真是可怜。而梦仍在继续。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mike, at least, was pleased by the obvious coolness between me and my lab partner. I could see he'd been worried that Edward's daring rescue might have impressed me, and he was relieved that it seemed to have the opposite effect. He grew more confident, sitting on the edge of my table to talk before Biology class started, ignoring Edward as completely as he ignored us.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我和实验搭档之间明显的冷淡，至少令迈克很高兴。我看得出他一直担心爱德华的英勇相救可能会感动我，而现在他放心了，结果似乎适得其反。他越来越自信了，生物学上课之前总要坐在我桌子边上聊，根本就不把爱德华放在眼里，就像他根本不把我们放在眼里一样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="第二天，我惊讶地发现杰西卡上三角和西班牙语课时不像平时那样滔滔不绝了。她课间走在我旁边的时候一声没吭，我也没敢问她原因。要是迈克拒绝了她，她告诉谁也不会告诉我的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mike was still quiet as he walked me to class, the uncomfortable look on his face a bad sign.

<div class="line_cn" title="“好的，你说得对”他咕哝了一句，然后沮丧地转身回到自己的座位上去了。我闭上双眼，用指头按了按太阳穴，想把愧疚与同情从脑袋中挤出去。班纳先生开始说话了，我叹了口气，睁开了眼睛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I looked down at my book as soon as his eyes released me, trying to find my place. Cowardly as ever, I shifted my hair over my right shoulder to hide my face. I couldn't believe the rush of emotion pulsing through me -- just because he'd happened to look at me for the first time in a half-dozen weeks.

I revved the engine deafeningly and reversed out into the aisle. Edward was in his car already, two spaces down, sliding out smoothly in front of me, cutting me off. He stopped there -- to wait for his family; I could see the four of them walking this way, but still by the cafeteria. I considered taking out the rear of his shiny Volvo, but there were too many witnesses. I looked in my rearview mirror. A line was beginning to form.

<div class="line_en">I looked forward to see Alice, Rosalie, Emmett, and Jasper all sliding into the Volvo. In his rearview mirror, Edward's eyes were on me.

<div class="line_en">It was Jessica, and she was jubilant; Mike had caught her after school to accept her invitation. I celebrated with her briefly while I stirred. She had to go, she wanted to call Angela and Lauren to tell them. I suggested -- with casual innocence -- that maybe Angela, the shy girl who had Biology with me, could ask Eric. And Lauren, a standoffish girl who had always ignored me at the lunch table, could ask Tyler; I'd heard he was still available. Jess thought that was a great idea. Now that she was sure of Mike, she actually sounded sincere when she said she wished I would go to the dance. I gave her my Seattle excuse.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“贝拉，这可不能怪我哟，谁叫你这么不小心呢”他的声音和平常一样轻——轻得像绒毛似的，好像没有出声似的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Why the traffic jam last night?" I demanded, still looking away. "I thought you were supposed to be pretending I don't exist, not irritating me to death."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“昨晚塞车是怎么回事”我问，依旧望着一边“我看你是在装着没看见我在你后面，这没把我给气死”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你…”我气吁吁地说道。我想不出可以形容他坏的词儿来了。我觉得我的怒火都可以把他烧冒烟了，可他似乎只是觉得更好笑了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="我的双手都在发抖了——恨不得揍什么东西几拳。我惊讶自己这是怎么啦。我平常可不是一个喜欢动粗的人。我背过身去走开了。">查看中文翻译</div>
