<div class="line_en">The train jostled and juddered as it jumped over the points, then settled down into a gently vibrating rumble. She closed her eyes again and rested her head against the seat.</div>

<div class="line_en">She remembered promising to text her dad to tell him she was on the train and, with some difficulty, squeezed her phone out of her pocket. One of the oversized carrier bags shifted with her and rolled dangerously close to the end of the seat before the woman opposite her reached forward and shoved it back. Dylan heard her tut angrily but ignored her. Flicking the screen to life, she began to text.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她想起自己答应给爸爸发个短信，告诉他她现在已经上车了。她有些困难地把手机从口袋里掏出来。一个超大号的购物袋也跟着动了一下，滚到了座位边缘，险些掉下去。对面的女人手向前一伸，又把袋子推了上去。迪伦听到她生气地啧了一声，但没有理会这些。她把手机屏幕解锁，然后开始编辑短信。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When Dylan opened her eyes, she was on the train again. She blinked, confused for a moment, but then accepted this bizarre turn of events with an almost imperceptible shrug.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦睁开眼睛的时候，她又坐回了列车上。她眨眨眼，困惑了好一会儿，最后还是轻轻耸了耸肩，接受了这匪夷所思的变化。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Perplexed, her brow furrowed. She must have dozed off again. The harsh lights of the carriage hurt her eyes, making her squint. Shaking her head a little to clear the cobwebs, Dylan shifted uncomfortably in her seat. The woman's bags were taking up a ridiculous amount of space and something sharp from a bright orange carrier was digging painfully into her ribs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她困惑地皱起了眉头。她刚才一定是又打了个盹。车厢里的灯光刺得她把眼睛眯了起来，她轻轻晃晃脑袋好让头脑清醒些。迪伦在座位上有些不自在地换了个姿势。那个女人的袋子占了周围很大一块空间，简直太离谱了。一个橙黄色的手提袋里有东西硌得她肋骨难受。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Instead of juice, her phone was covered in a thick, dark red substance that trickled down her heart-shaped phone charm and dripped slowly off the end, falling to create small explosions on the knee of her jeans. Looking up, she met the eyes of the woman across from her for the first time. They stared back, lifeless. Blood tricked from her scalp and her mouth hung open, grey lips pulled back in a scream. Dylan looked around wildly and spotted the two Rangers fans she had tried to avoid. They were lying with their arms around each other, heads together at an angle that just looked wrong. Another jolt of the train made them flop forward like puppets, their heads held on to their necks by thin threads of sinew. Dylan opened her mouth to scream as the world was torn apart.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不是果汁，手机上满是黏稠的暗红色物质，顺着她的心形手机吊坠慢慢往下淌，把膝盖部位的牛仔裤打湿了一小片。她一抬头，目光与对面女人的眼睛第一次相遇，那双眼也在凝视着自己，没有一丝生气。鲜血顺着她的头皮往下流淌，她的嘴大张着，乌青的嘴唇在尖叫声中向后收缩。迪伦漫无目的地四处张望，正好看到之前她想躲着的两位流浪者队球迷。他们相互搂着躺在那里，两个人头的位置怎么看都不对劲。车身又是一阵颠簸，两人竟然像牵线木偶一样扑通向前栽倒。他们的头跟脖子之间只连着几根细细的筋。乾坤倒转，迪伦张开嘴大叫起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dad, on train. Not running too late at…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爸爸，我在车上。没有晚点太久……">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A sudden jolt of the train jarred her elbow and ripped the phone from her fingers. She made a grab for it with her other hand, but only touched the bottom edge, sending it spinning further out of her reach. With a horrible snapping sound, it clattered to the ground and she heard a scrape as it skidded across the carriage.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="车身猛然颠簸了一下，她的胳膊肘一震，手机从手指间掉了下去。她用另一只手来抓，但只碰到了手机的底部，手机一下子飞得离自己更远了。可怕吧啪嗒一声，手机落到了地面上。迪伦听到手机滑过车厢时剐蹭的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Crap," she muttered quietly. Her fingers scrabbled around on the floor for a few seconds before they came into contact with the phone. It was sticky; some idiot must have spilled their juice on the floor. Dylan pulled the phone up to inspect the damage.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她暗自叫了声“完蛋了”，手指在地板上摸索了几秒钟，终于碰到了自己的手机。手机上黏糊糊的，肯定是哪个蠢货把果汁洒在地上了。迪伦把手机拿起来检查一下受损情况。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It began with a hideous screeching noise, a sound that set Dylan's teeth on edge and sawed at every nerve in her body, as metal collided with metal and ripped apart. The lights flickered and the train seemed to buck and jerk beneath her feet. She was flung forward in her seat with incredible force, sprawling across the carriage directly into the monstrous woman in front of her. The woman's dead arms seemed prepared to embrace her, and the gaping mouth stretched wider into a hideous grin.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一开始先是传来可怕而尖锐的噪声，这声音让迪伦烦躁不安，像是把她身体里的每段神经都锯开了，那是金属之间相互摩擦撕扯的声音。灯光闪烁，整列火车似乎就在她的脚下颠簸痉挛。一股巨大的力量把她从座位上向前甩，她挣扎着穿过车厢，一头栽到前面那个可怕的女人身上。女人的胳膊像是准备拥抱她似的，她大张着的嘴咧得更开了，似在狰狞地大笑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Dylan!" The voice, unfamiliar at first, pulled her back into consciousness. "Dylan, wake up!" Something was shaking her shoulder, hard.</div>

<div class="line_en">The cottage looked colder in the morning light. The walls had been painted cream at some point, but that had long since faded and begun to peel away. The holes in the roof and the missing windows had allowed damp to seep into the walls and now patches of green moss were spreading across the surface. The careless abandon of furniture and possessions was sad somehow. Dylan imagined someone, at some point, lovingly arranging the room with items that held meaning and emotion. Now they were just discarded and neglected.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="晨光下的小屋看起来要冷一点。四面墙以前都粉刷过，但早已经褪色并开始剥落了。屋顶上的破洞和消失的窗户让湿气渗进墙里，一片片苔藓在上面蔓延。那些被主人随意丢弃的家具和物品看起来都带着些许悲凉。迪伦想象着某个人，在过去某个时间，曾经非常精心地布置房间，屋里的每件陈设都凝聚着特殊的意义和情感。而现在它们全都荒废在此，无人理睬。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Nightmare," Dylan muttered, embarrassed now. She pulled herself upright, away from his stare, and glanced around. The fire had long since died but the first light of dawn had begun to brighten the sky and she was able to see her surroundings clearly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“噩梦。”她小声嘀咕着，无比尴尬。她挺直身子，躲闪着他的目光，四处打量。壁炉里的火早就灭了，但第一缕晨光已经开始照亮天空，周围的环境也已经清晰可见了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For some bizarre reason, the idea made her choke up. Her throat tightened and tears threatened to spill down her cheeks. What was wrong with her?</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“那，有什么打算？”她故意显得轻松愉快，把刚才尴尬的一幕掩饰过去。从某种程度上说，这还真奏效了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He lifted half of his mouth in a smile and moved over to the door. "We walk. That way." He pointed with his arm and then stood with his hands on his hips, waiting for her to join him.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Fine." Dylan took a deep breath and attempted to smile at him. It felt unconvincing, but she hoped that he didn't know her well enough to see through it. He narrowed his eyes slightly, but nodded.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没事。”迪伦做了一个深呼吸，想给崔斯坦一个微笑。她感觉自己这话没什么说服力，但她希望崔斯坦对自己了解不深，看不透自己的心事。他的眼睛微微眯起，但还是点了点头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You okay?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你还好吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Dammit," Dylan muttered, getting hastily to her feet and chasing clumsily after him.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Now?" Dylan asked, incredulous.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“现在吗？”迪伦问，有些不敢相信。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yup," he replied shortly and disappeared out of the door. She stared at the doorframe he had just vacated, aghast. They couldn't just go. Not without having a drink from the stream and trying to find some food, or maybe even having a quick wash. She wondered what he would do if she just sat there and refused to follow him. Keep walking, probably.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“对。”他应了一声就消失在门外。迪伦望着他刚穿过的门框，一时感到愕然。他们不能就这样走，河里的水都没喝一口，也没去找点吃的，连简简单单冲洗一下都没有。她想知道要是自己就坐在这儿不跟他走，他会有什么反应。也许，他会继续走下去吧。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Tristan, this is ridiculous."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“现在回去太晚了。”他窃笑着说，然后转过身接着朝前走。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"My point is that we must be walking round in circles. If you really knew where you were going, we'd have got there by now." Dylan hitched her hands on her hips, ready to argue, but to her surprise Tristan's face looked almost relieved. That confused her. "We can't just keep going," she continued.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我想说的是，我们肯定是在兜圈子。要是你真的知道我们要到哪儿去，现在我们早就到了。”迪伦双手叉着腰，准备跟他展开辩论。但让她吃惊的是，崔斯坦的脸看起来几乎是如释重负。这倒让她有点糊涂了，“我们不能就这样一直走个不停。”她又补充了一句。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dylan shifted from foot to foot, undecided. She desperately wanted to go back to the site of the crash, certain that someone in charge, someone who could fix this, would be there. On the other hand, she would never be able to find it alone and she was terrified of being deserted in the wilderness. He seemed to sense her uncertainty. He walked back towards her, coming uncomfortably close, bending his knees so that they were at eye-level. She wanted to step backwards, but she was frozen like a rabbit in headlights. Echoes stirred in Dylan's memory, but then he was looking right at her, far too near, and she lost her train of thought.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦的双脚来回换着重心，她又犹豫了。她急着要回到事故发生的地方，她确信总有负责的人，总有处理事故的人在那儿。但另一方面，她一个人不可能找到那儿，而且她也害怕被抛弃在荒野。崔斯坦似乎觉察出她拿不定主意，回身走到她身旁，两人的距离近得让她感觉不舒服。他弯下膝盖，目光与迪伦的视线平齐。她想往后退几步，但却像一只被汽车前灯照到的兔子一样，定在原地一动不动。迪伦的记忆里忽而浮现出似曾相识的画面，但随后他一直直视着她，两人的目光挨得如此之近，她的思绪又恍惚了。">查看中文翻译</div>

Her flared jeans had soaked up the water almost to her knees and they were dragging with every pace.</div>

Occasionally, if she stumbled, he would whip his head round, but as soon as he ascertained that she was fine, he would continue to march resolutely onward.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="而无论是她怒目而视，还是小声抱怨，崔斯坦都不为所动。他无情地按着自己的节奏走，不言不语，意志坚定，一直保持着在她前方一米左右的距离。偶尔她绊倒的时候，他会把头扭过来看看。然而一旦他确定她没事了，又会决绝地继续向前走去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dylan began to feel more and more uncomfortable. The silence between them was like a brick wall, totally impenetrable. It almost felt like he resented being stuck with her, like she was an inconvenient little sister he'd reluctantly promised to babysit. There was nothing to do but take on the role and traipse along after him; the sulky little girl who wasn't getting her way. Dylan was far too intimidated to try and confront him about his unfriendly, almost hostile, behaviour. She tucked her chin into her jumper and sighed. Looking down at the long grass, trying in vain to pick out the holes and oddly shaped clumps that longed to trip her, she muttered miserably under her breath and continued to plod in Tristan's wake.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦开始觉得越来越别扭。他们之间的沉默像一堵完全穿不透的砖墙。他似乎很讨厌跟她待在一起，好像他当初是迫于无奈才做出承诺，答应照顾她这个很麻烦的小妹妹似的。而她别无选择，只能继续演好她的角色—因为不能随心所欲而怒气冲冲的小女孩，拖着疲惫的脚步继续跟着他走。迪伦现在变得畏畏缩缩，不敢对他那些极不友好甚至可以说是充满敌意的举动稍有抵触。她把下巴缩进外套里，叹了口气。她低头看着脚下的萋萋荒草，草地上的洞和各种奇形怪状的土块都想把她绊倒，她尽量避开这些地方走，但依然徒劳。她轻声细语地哀叹几句，又继续步履沉重地跟着崔斯坦走下去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="又到了一座山的山顶，他终于停了下来，“需要歇一会儿吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dylan looked up, a little disorientated from lumbering with her head down for so long.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦抬眼看看，她埋着头走了很久，现在有点分不清东南西北。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yeah, that'd be good." She felt the need to whisper after the prolonged silence, but the wind that whipped around them snatched her words from the air as soon as they left her mouth. He seemed to understand though, because he ambled over to a large rock that protruded from the grass and heather, and arranged himself nonchalantly against it. He stared out across the landscape, as if on sentry duty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好啊，那太好了。”她感觉自己很长时间都没出声，现在需要低声说几句话。然而话刚出口，就被刺骨的山风卷走了。不过，他似乎也听懂了。杂草和石楠花间兀立着一块巨石，他缓步走上前，冷冷地靠在石头上，像在站岗放哨似的，远眺着荒原。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dylan didn't have the energy to look for a suitable dry spot. She sank to the ground where she stood. Almost instantly the wet grass seeped through her jacket and then her seat, but her shoes and jeans were already so cold and soggy that she barely registered the change. She was too tired to think, too tired to argue. Robbed of spirit, she was ready to blindly follow wherever Tristan chose to lead her. Perhaps that had been his plan all along, she thought blackly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦没有那么多精力来找一处合适又干燥的地方。她就地瘫倒，野草上的水一下子就渗进了外套。但是她的鞋和牛仔裤早就湿透了，所以她几乎察觉不到有什么异样。她太累了，一句话也不想说，甚至什么也不愿意想。她现在变得失魂落魄，崔斯坦把她往哪儿领，她就没头没脑地跟在后面。也许他一直就是这么计划来着，她愠怒地想。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Suddenly Tristan looked in her direction, and she was too absorbed in her thoughts to look away in time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然，崔斯坦望了她一眼，她正沉浸在自己的思绪里，没有及时把目光移到别处。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was odd; somewhere at the back of her mind she knew that there were several things wrong. There was the fact that they had walked for the best part of two days and not met anybody, the fact that she hadn't eaten or drunk anything since the crash yet she didn't feel hungry or thirsty, and finally -- most frightening of all -- the fact that she hadn't spoken to her mum or dad for forty-eight hours and they had no idea where she was or that she was all right. Somehow these thoughts stayed at the back of her head, nagging her, but only vaguely; gentle tugs on the tail of a charging stallion. She couldn't focus on them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="很奇怪，她心底里明明知道有好些事都不对劲。实际上，这两天的大部分时间里他们都在走路，却一个人也没遇到；实际上，自从事故以后她一直都没吃没喝，但是却既不饿也不渴；最后一个事实—也是最可怕的一点—她已经四十八小时没有跟父母联系了，他们不知道她在哪儿，也不知道她没事了。不知怎的，这些想法总在头脑里挥之不去，一直在困扰着她，但这些困扰也只是隐隐地发作，就像在奔腾驰骋的骏马尾巴上轻轻拽了几下。她没法把精力集中在这些事情上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What?" he asked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“怎么了？”他问道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dylan bit her lip, wondering which of a million questions to put to him first. He was very hard to talk to, and he hadn't asked her one single question about herself. Wasn't he at all curious? The only conclusion Dylan could come up with was that he'd rather she wasn't there. He probably wished that he'd started walking as soon as he'd left the tunnel, instead of waiting to see if anyone else would appear. Dylan wasn't sure if that wouldn't have been better for her, too. She could have stayed by the tunnel mouth, and if nobody had come, then eventually she would have persuaded herself to go back through the tunnel and out the other side. By now she would have been home again and fighting with Joan about making another trip to Aberdeen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦咬着嘴唇，心里纠结自己攒的一百万个问题先问他哪个好。和他聊天太费劲了，他也从来不问任何关于她本人的问题。难道他一点也不好奇吗？迪伦能得出的唯一结论就是他宁愿她当时根本不在那儿。也许他宁愿当时一出隧道就开始走路，根本不用等着看还有什么人出现。迪伦也不确定，要是那样的话，对她来说会不会更好。她本可以就待在隧道口。如果没有人来的话，她本可以劝说自己重新穿回隧道，从另一头出来。那样现在她早就回家了，说不定正在为再去一次阿伯丁和琼吵得不可开交呢。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He shrugged, apparently unconcerned. "Just an animal. They introduced some wolves here a while back. Don't worry," he added with a small smile, looking at her nervous expression. "There are plenty of deer around here for them to eat. They aren't going to bother about you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他耸耸肩，显然没把这个放在心上，“一只动物而已，前一阵子他们带回来几匹狼。别担心。”他说完看着她一脸的紧张，又笑着补了一句，“这儿周围有很多鹿供它们吃，它们不会来找你麻烦的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A distant howl erupted somewhere to her left. It was high-pitched, mournful, like an animal in pain. The noise seemed to echo off the surrounding hills, giving it an eerie, unearthly quality. It made her shiver.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="左侧传来一声遥远的号叫，声音高亢而凄厉，像是动物痛苦的哀鸣。这叫声似乎在周围的群山间回荡，又添了几分怪诞和诡异。迪伦不由得打了个寒战。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“那是什么？”她问崔斯坦。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He looked up at the darkening sky. It had melted into late afternoon without Dylan really noticing. Surely they hadn't walked for that long? She folded her arms across her chest, hugging herself for warmth. The wind seemed suddenly stronger. Swirling around her, it tugged stray strands of hair across her face, making them dance in front of her eyes like rippling shadows. She tried to brush them aside, but her reaching fingers found nothing but air.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他抬头看了看越来越阴沉的天空。在迪伦不知不觉间，又到了黄昏时分。他们肯定没有走那么久吧？她抱着臂，好让自己暖和一点。风势陡然转强，吹得她乱发拂面。长发在眼前飞舞，如同波影荡漾。她想把头发捋到一边，可伸出来的手指只抓到空气。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tristan pushed off from the rock he was leaning against, his eyes searching the oncoming night. "All the same, we should get a move on," he said. "We don't want to be stuck on the top of a hill when it gets dark."</div>

<div class="line_en">It really had got very dark in a ridiculously short space of time. Dylan found it hard to see as they made their way down the hill. This side of the peak was covered in gravel that skidded out from under her feet and rocks that were slick with recent rain. She tried to pick her way, shuffling forward a small step at a time, keeping one foot firmly on the ground whilst she felt her way along the ground hesitantly with the other. It was very slow going and she could feel Tristan's impatience. Still, he dropped back to walk by her side, the arm closest to her half extended, ready to grab her if she fell, and that was comforting. Above the wind and the sound of her breathing, occasionally she caught the faint baying of wild animals prowling in the night.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="才一会儿工夫天色就很暗了，简直快得不可思议。他们费力地往山下走，迪伦发现自己很难看清路。山顶的这一侧全是碎石子，脚踩上去就打滑。而且最近刚下过雨，山上的岩石也是滑溜溜的。她尽量小心翼翼地往前走，先慢慢挪一小步，一只脚稳稳站定后，另一只脚才开始犹犹豫豫地在地上探。这样走起来异常缓慢，她能感受到崔斯坦又不耐烦了。不过，他还是折返回去和她并排而行，离她最近的一只胳膊半伸着，随时准备在她摔倒时拉住她，这让她略感放心。除了风声和她的呼吸声，她隐隐听得到夜行动物的号叫。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Stop." Tristan flung his arm out in front of Dylan. Shocked by his abrupt halt, she turned to gaze at him, wide-eyed. Taking in his stance, she felt a nudge of apprehension thrill through her. He was standing stock still, absolutely alert. Every muscle in his body was tense, ready for action. His eyes were focused intently on something ahead, darting in small, quick movements as he scanned the scene in front of them. His eyebrows were pulled down over his eyes, his mouth set in a grim line. Whatever it was, it wasn't good.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“停。”崔斯坦伸出胳膊挡在迪伦身前。他突然停下，让迪伦吃惊不小，她转过头瞪大了眼看着他。等她看清他的站姿时，不禁吓得浑身一凛。他站在那里一动不动，异常警觉。身上的每块肌肉都绷紧了，严阵以待。他的眼睛紧盯着前方，一边四下扫视，一边迈着小碎步疾行。他双眉紧锁，双唇紧绷。不管前方是什么，肯定来者不善。">查看中文翻译</div>
