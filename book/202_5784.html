<div class="line_en">"Good, you'll do perfectly well." Umbridge spoke to the wizard in black and gold. "That's that problem solved, Minister, if Mafalda can be spared for record-keeping we shall be able to start straightaway." She consulted her clipboard. "Ten people today and one of them the wife of a Ministry employee! Tut, tut… even here, in the heart of the Ministry!" She stepped into the lift beside Hermione, as did the two wizards who had been listening to Umbridge's conversation with the Minister. "We'll go straight down, Mafalda, you'll find everything you need in the courtroom. Good morning, Albert, aren't you getting out?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"Needed a quick word with," Harry hesitated for a fraction of a second, "Arthur Weasley. Someone said he was up on level one."</div>

<div class="line_en">"What brings you up here, Runcorn?" asked the new Minister of Magic. His long black hair and beard were streaked with silver, and a great overhanging forehead shadowed his glinting eyes, putting Harry in mind of a crab looking out from beneath a rock.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你来这儿有何贵干，伦考恩？”新任魔法部长问道，他黑色的长发和胡须中夹着缕缕银丝，大脑门的阴影遮着闪烁的双眼，让哈利想到一只螃蟹正从岩石底下往外张望着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry watched Thicknesse march away along the thickly carpeted corridor. The moment the Minister had passed out of sight, Harry tugged the Invisibility Cloak out from under his heavy black cloak, threw it over himself, and set off along the corridor in the opposite direction. Runcorn was so tall that Harry was forced to stoop to make sure his big feet were hidden.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利目送辛克尼斯在铺着厚地毯的过道里走远。部长刚一消失，哈利就从沉重的黑袍子底下掏出隐形衣，披到身上，沿相反的方向走去。伦考恩个子那么高，哈利不得不弯下身子，以确保他的大脚不会露出来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He stopped walking, leaned against a wall, and tried to decide what to do. The silence pressed upon him: There was no bustling or talk or swift footsteps here; the purple-carpeted corridors were as hushed as though the Muffliato charm had been cast over the place.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他停住脚步，靠在墙上，试图拿定主意该怎么办。寂静压迫着他：这里没有忙碌声、讲话声和匆匆的脚步声，铺着紫红地毯的过道里鸦雀无声，好像施了闭耳塞听咒一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Panic pulsed in the pit of his stomach. As he passed gleaming wooden door after gleaming wooden door, each bearing a small plaque with the owner's name and occupation upon it, the might of the Ministry, its complexity, its impenetrability, seemed to force itself upon him so that the plan he had been carefully concocting with Ron and Hermione over the past four weeks seemed laughably childish. They had concentrated all their efforts on getting inside without being detected: They had not given a moment's thought to what they would do if they were forced to separate. Now Hermione was stuck in court proceedings, which would undoubtedly last hours; Ron was struggling to do magic that Harry was sure was beyond him, a woman's liberty possibly depending on the outcome; and he, Harry, was wandering around on the top floor when he knew perfectly well that his quarry had just gone down in the lift.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="恐惧一阵阵袭上心头，他经过一扇又一扇亮光光的木门，每扇门上都有一块小牌子，写着屋里人的姓名和职务。魔法部的威严、复杂和高深莫测似乎把他给镇住了，使他和罗恩、赫敏四个星期来精心筹划的行动方案显得像可笑的儿戏。他们把全部心思都放在怎样混进去，却根本没有想过倘若彼此被迫分开怎么办。现在赫敏困在法庭上，那无疑一拖就是几小时；罗恩在努力尝试哈利知道是超出他能力之外的魔法，而一个女人的自由可能取决于他的表现；哈利呢，还在顶层游荡，明明知道自己要找的人刚乘电梯下去了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Now paying attention to the names on the doors, Harry turned a corner. Halfway along the next corridor he emerged into a wide, open space where a dozen witches and wizards sat in rows at small desks not unlike school desks, though much more highly polished and free from graffiti. Harry paused to watch them, for the effect was quite mesmerizing. They were all waving and twiddling their wands in unison, and squares of colored paper were flying in every direction like little pink kites. After a few seconds, Harry realized that there was a rhythm to the proceedings, that the papers all formed the same pattern; and after a few more seconds he realized that what he was watching was the creation of pamphlets -- that the paper squares were pages, which, when assembled, folded, and magicked into place, fell into neat stacks beside each witch or wizard.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利开始注意看门上的名字，转过一个拐角走了一段后，过道通入一块宽敞的区域。十来个男女巫师坐在一排排小桌子前，那些桌子与课桌相似，只是光滑得多，没有乱涂的痕迹。哈利不由得停下来观看，因为这景象有种催眠的效果。那些巫师动作一致地挥舞和转动着魔杖，许多方形彩纸像粉红色的小风筝一样飘在空中。几秒钟后，哈利意识到这是一种有节奏的程序，彩纸的聚散也有一定规律。又过了几秒钟，他意识到自己在观看小册子的制作过程，那些方纸是一页页内容，聚拢折叠，用魔法订牢之后，整齐地摞在每个巫师身边。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Her office must be up here, Harry thought.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她的办公室一定在这儿，哈利想。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It seemed most unlikely that Umbridge would keep her jewelry in her office, but on the other hand it seemed foolish not to search it to make sure. He therefore set off along the corridor again, passing nobody but a frowning wizard who was murmuring instructions to a quill that floated in front of him, sCRIbbling on a trail of parchment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="乌姆里奇把珠宝藏在办公室的可能性似乎不大，然而不搜一搜，确定一下，又似乎是愚蠢的。于是他又沿着过道走去，路上只看到一个皱着眉头的男巫正在对一支羽毛笔念念有词地说着什么，那笔悬空在他面前的一卷羊皮纸上飞快地写着字。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry crept closer, although the workers were so intent on what they were doing that he doubted they would notice a carpet-muffled footstep, and he slid a completed pamphlet from the pile beside a young witch. He examined it beneath the Invisibility Cloak. Its pink cover was emblazoned with a golden title:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利轻手轻脚地走近，其实，那些巫师工作那么专心，他怀疑他们并不会注意到他因地毯而减弱的脚步声。他从一个年轻女巫身边偷偷取了一份装订好的小册子，拿到隐形衣里来看。粉红色的封面上印着醒目的金字标题：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Beneath the title was a picture of a red rose with a simpering face in the middle of its petals, being strangled by a green weed with fangs and a scowl. There was no author's name upon the pamphlet, but again, the scars on the back of his right hand seemed to tingle as he examined it. Then the young witch beside him confirmed his suspicion as she said, still waving and twirling her wand, "Will the old hag be interrogating Mudbloods all day, does anyone know?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="下面画着一朵红玫瑰被一根长着毒牙、一副凶相的绿草紧紧勒住，花瓣中央是一张傻笑的面孔。小册子上没有署名，但哈利右手手背的伤疤又隐隐刺痛起来。这时身旁的女巫证实了他内心的怀疑，她一边挥舞和转动着魔杖，一边说道：“那老妖婆一整天都要在那儿审问泥巴种吗？有谁知道？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Careful," said the wizard beside her, glancing around nervously; one of his pages slipped and fell to the floor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“当心。”她旁边的男巫不安地张望了一下说，他的一张纸滑落到地上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The witch glanced toward the shining mahogany door facing the space full of pamphlet-makers; Harry looked too, and rage reared in him like a snake. Where there might have been a peephole on a Muggle front door, a large, round eye with a bright blue iris had been set into the wood -- an eye that was shockingly familiar to anybody who had known Alastor Moody.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="女巫朝小册子制作者们对面的那扇油亮的红木门瞥了一眼。哈利也向那边看去，一股愤怒像毒蛇一样在他胸中蹿起。在麻瓜门上安门镜的的地方，红木中嵌着一只大大的圆眼球，明亮的蓝色虹膜，对任何认识阿拉斯托·穆迪的人来说，都熟悉得触目惊心。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For a split second Harry forgot where he was and what he was doing there: He even forgot that he was invisible. He strode straight over to the door to examine the eye. It was not moving: It gazed blindly upward, frozen. The plaque beneath it read:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在那一瞬间，哈利忘记了自己是在哪儿，要来做什么，甚至忘记了他是隐形的。他大步走到门前走看那只眼睛，它不再转动，只是呆滞地望着上方。下面的牌子上写着：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It scuttled away at once through the legs of the witches and wizards in front of him. A few moments later, during which Harry waited with his hand upon the doorknob, there came a loud bang and a great deal of aCRId black smoke billowed from a corner. The young witch in the front row shrieked: Pink pages flew everywhere as she and her fellows jumped up, looking around for the source of the commotion. Harry turned the doorknob, stepped into Umbridge's office, and closed the door behind him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="诱饵炸弹立刻动起来，疾速穿行在那群巫师的小腿之间。哈利把手扶在门把手上等着，少顷，便听到一声巨响，大量呛鼻的黑烟从一个角落里涌出。前排那个年轻女巫尖叫起来，粉红色纸页飞得到处都是，她和同伴们都跳了起来，四处寻找混乱的来源。哈利趁机转动门把手，踏进了乌姆里奇的办公室，把门在身后关上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry looked back at the dozen pamphlet-makers: Though they were intent upon their work, he could hardly suppose that they would not notice if the door of an empty office opened in front of them. He therefore withdrew from an inner pocket an odd object with little waving legs and a rubber-bulbed horn for a body. Crouching down beneath the Cloak, he placed the Decoy Detonator on the ground.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利回头看看那十几个做小册子的巫师，尽管他们都在忙着干活，但如果一间空办公室的门在他们面前打开，很难设想会没人注意到。于是他从衣服里面的口袋里掏出一个奇形怪状的东西。它长着摆动的小腿，身体是个球形的橡皮喇叭。哈利在隐形衣里蹲下身，把诱饵炸弹搁到地板上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Nothing happened, but he had not expected it to; no doubt Umbridge knew all about protective charms and spells. He therefore hurried behind her desk and began pulling open the drawers. He saw quills and notebooks and Spellotape; enchanted paper clips that coiled snakelike from their drawer and had to be beaten back; a fussy little lace box full of spare hair bows and clips; but no sign of a locket.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没有动静，但他也没指望会有，乌姆里奇无疑对防护咒十分精通。他急忙走到办公桌后，拉开一个个抽屉，看到羽毛笔、笔记本和涂改带；施有魔法的回形针像蛇一样从抽屉里盘旋钻出，他不得不把它们打回去；还有一个考究的花边小盒子里装满蝴蝶结和发卡；就是不见挂坠盒。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He felt he had stepped back in time. The room was exactly like Umbridge's office at Hogwarts: Lace draperies, doilies, and dried flowers covered every available surface. The walls bore the same ornamental plates, each featuring a highly colored, beribboned kitten, gamboling and frisking with sickening cuteness. The desk was covered with a flouncy, flowered cloth. Behind Mad-Eye's eye, a telescopic attachment enabled Umbridge to spy on the workers on the other side of the door. Harry took a look through it and saw that they were all still gathered around the Decoy Detonator. He wrenched the telescope out of the door, leaving a hole behind, pulled the magical eyeball out of it, and placed it in his pocket. Then he turned to face the room again, raised his wand, and murmured, "Accio Locket."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他感觉好像时光倒流一样，这间屋子与乌姆里奇在霍格沃茨的办公室一模一样：花边帷帘、装饰布垫和干花覆盖了每一处能装饰到的表面，墙上还是那些花盘子，图案都是一只戴着蝴蝶结、色彩鲜艳的大猫，在那里欢跳嬉戏，嗲得令人恶心。桌上盖着一块有荷叶边和花卉装饰的桌布。疯眼汉的眼球后面连着个望远镜似的装置，使乌姆里奇可以监视门外的员工。哈利凑上去看了一眼，见他们仍围在诱饵炸弹旁边。他把望远镜从门上扯下来，门上留下了一个洞。他拆下魔眼装进兜里，然后转身面向屋内，举起魔杖低声念道：“挂坠盒飞来。”">查看中文翻译</div>

A little pink note was stuck to it with a picture of a kitten in the corner. Harry moved across to read it and saw that Umbridge had written, "To be punished."</div>

<div class="line_en">Angrier than ever, he proceeded to grope in the bottoms of the vases and baskets of dried flowers, but was not at all surprised that the locket was not there. He gave the office one last sweeping look, and his heart skipped a beat. Dumbledore was staring at him from a small rectangular mirror, propped up on a bookcase beside the desk.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他更加怒火中烧，在干花的花瓶和篮子里摸索，但没摸到挂坠盒，他也并不意外。他最后扫视了一下这间办公室，突然心脏停跳了一下：桌边的书架上，邓布利多正从一面长方形的小镜子里望着他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry opened the book at random and saw a full-page photograph of two teenage boys, both laughing immoderately with their arms around each other's shoulders. Dumbledore, now with elbowlength hair, had grown a tiny wispy beard that recalled the one on Krum's chin that had so annoyed Ron. The boy who roared in silent amusement beside Dumbledore had a gleeful, wild look about him. His golden hair fell in curls to his shoulders. Harry wondered whether it was a young Doge, but before he could check the caption, the door of the office opened.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利随手把书打开，看到一页照片，是两个十来岁的男孩，互相搭着肩膀，放肆地大笑。邓布利多头发已长及胳膊肘，还多了一绺淡淡的小胡子，让人想到克鲁姆下巴上让罗恩那么讨厌的细须。在邓布利多旁边无声大笑的那个少年给人一种快乐狂放的感觉，金色的鬈发垂到肩头。哈利猜想他是不是年轻时的多吉，但还没来得及看说明，办公室的门开了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry crossed the room at a run and snatched it up, but realized the moment he touched it that it was not a mirror at all. Dumbledore was smiling wistfully out of the front cover of a glossy book.

<div class="line_en">If Thicknesse had not been looking over his shoulder as he entered, Harry would not have had time to pull the Invisibility Cloak over himself. As it was, he thought Thicknesse might have caught a glimpse of movement, because for a moment or two he remained quite still, staring curiously at the place where Harry had just vanished.

Slowly and very carefully he edged his way along the platform behind Umbridge, Yaxley, and Hermione, taking a seat behind the latter. He was worried about making Hermione jump.
