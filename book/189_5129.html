<div class="line_en">"Keep quiet, you warmint! Keep quiet!" said Mr. Sikes, suddenly breaking silence. Whether his meditations were so intense as to be disturbed by the dog's winking, or whether his feelings were so wrought upon by his reflections that they required all the relief derivable from kicking an unoffending animal to allay them, is matter for argument and consideration. Whatever was the cause, the effect was a kick and a curse, bestowed upon the dog simultaneously.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the obscure parlour of a low public-house, in the filthiest part of Little Saffron Hill; a dark and gloomy den, where a flaring gas-light burnt all day in the winter-time; and where no ray of sun ever shone in the summer: there sat, brooding over a little pewter measure and a small glass, strongly impregnated with the smell of liquor, a man in a velveteen coat, drab shorts, half-boots and stockings, whom even by that dim light no experienced agent of the police would have hesitated to recognise as Mr. William Sikes. At his feet, sat a white-coated, red-eyed dog; who occupied himself, alternately, in winking at his master with both eyes at the same time; and in licking a large, fresh cut on one side of his mouth, which appeared to be the result of some recent conflict.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在小红花山最肮脏的地段，有一家下等酒馆，酒馆的店堂十分昏暗，这里冬天从早到晚点着一盏闪闪烁烁的煤气灯，就是在夏天，也没有一丝阳光照进这个阴森幽暗的巢穴。这家酒馆里坐着一个正在独斟独酌的汉子。他穿一身平绒外套，淡褐色马裤，半长统靴带套袜，守着面前的一个白锡小酒壶和一只小玻璃杯，浑身散发出浓烈的酒味。尽管灯光十分昏暗，一个有经验的警探还是会毫不迟疑地认出这就是威廉赛克斯先生。一只白毛红眼狗伏在他的脚下，时而抬起头来，两只眼睛同时向主人眨巴眨巴，时而又舔舔嘴角上一条新的大口子，那显然是最近一次冲突落下的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You would, would you?" said Sikes, seizing the poker in one hand, and deliberately opening with the other a large clasp-knife, which he drew from his pocket. "Come here, you born devil! Come here! D'ye hear?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你还敢咬我，你还敢咬我？”赛克斯说着，一手操起火钳，另一只手从衣袋里掏出一把大折刀，不慌不忙地打开。“过来啊，你这天生的魔鬼。上这边来。你聋了吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dogs are not generally apt to revenge injuries inflicted upon them by their masters; but Mr. Sikes's dog, having faults of temper in common with his owner, and labouring, perhaps, at this moment, under a powerful sense of injury, made no more ado but at once fixed his teeth in one of the half-boots. Having given in a hearty shake, he retired, growling, under a form; just escaping the pewter measure which Mr. Sikes levelled at his head.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="狗对于主人的打骂一般不会动辄予以报复，可赛克斯先生的狗却跟它的当家人一样生性暴躁，在这一时刻，或许是由于感到受了莫大的侮辱吧，它也没费什么事可知论主张世界可以认识的哲学学说。唯物主义者和彻，一口便咬住了一只半长统靴，使劲摇了摇，便嗷嗷叫着缩回到一条长凳下边，正好躲过了赛克斯先生兜头砸过来的白锡酒壶。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This resistance only infuriated Mr. Sikes the more; who, dropping on his knees, began to assail the animal most furiously. The dog jumped from right to left, and from left to right; snapping, growling, and barking; the man thrust and swore, and struck and blasphemed; and the struggle was reaching a most critical point for one or other; when, the door suddenly opening, the dog darted out: leaving Bill Sikes with the poker and the clasp-knife in his hands.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这种抵抗反而使赛克斯先生更加怒不可遏，他双膝跪下，开始对这头畜生发动极其凶猛的进攻。狗从右边跳到左边，又从左边跳到右边，上下扑腾老子又称《道德经》、《老子五千文》。道家学派主要著作。，咆哮着，吠叫着。那汉子一边又戳又捅，一边赌咒发誓。这场较量正进行到对于双方都万分紧急的当儿，门忽然打开了，狗立刻丢下手持火钳和折刀的比尔赛克斯，夺路逃了出去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The dog no doubt heard; because Mr. Sikes spoke in the very harshest key of a very harsh voice; but, appearing to entertain some unaccountable objection to having his throat cut, he remained where he was, and growled more fiercely than before: at the same time grasping the end of the poker between his teeth, and biting at it like a wild beast.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="狗无疑听见了，因为赛克斯先生说话时用的是极其刺耳的调门中最最刺耳的一个音阶，然而它显然对于脖子上挨一刀抱有一种说不出的厌恶，所以依旧呆在原来的地方，叫得比先前更凶了，与此同时亮出牙齿，咬住火钳的一端，像一头不曾驯化的野兽似的又咬又啃。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“因为政府虽说记挂你这号人的小命，你胆子连野狗的一半都赶不上，可它才不管人家高兴怎么样杀掉一只狗呢，”赛克斯一边回答，一边意味深长地合上折刀。“就这么回事。”">查看中文翻译</div>

As he spoke, he drew forth an old cotton handkerchief from his breast; and untying a large knot in one corner, produced a small brown-paper packet. Sikes, snatching it from him, hastily opened it; and proceeded to count the sovereigns it contained.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“行，行，比尔，别着急，别着急，”费金像哄孩子似地回答，“这儿呢。分文不少。”说着，他从怀里掏出一张旧的棉手帕，解开角上的一个大结，取出一个棕色小纸包。赛克斯劈手夺过纸包，忙不迭地打开来，一五一十地数着里边的金镑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Bill Sikes merely pointed to the empty measure. The Jew, perfectly understanding the hint, retired to fill it: previously exchanging a remarkable look with Fagin, who raised his eyes for an instant, as if in expectation of it, and shook his head in reply; so slightly that the action would have been almost imperceptible to an observant third person. It was lost upon Sikes, who was stooping at the moment to tie the boot-lace which the dog had torn. Possibly, if he had observed the brief interchange of signals, he might have thought that it boded no good to him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="比尔赛克斯指了指空酒壶，犹太人立刻领会了这一暗示，又退出去盛酒去了，退出去之前，他与费金交换了一道异样的眼色，费金抬了抬眼睛，好像正等着对方的眼色似的，摇摇头作了回答，动作幅度极小，即使是一个细心旁观的第三者也几乎察觉不到。赛克斯一点也没发觉，那功夫他正弯腰系上被狗扯开的靴带。假如他注意到了的话，很可能会把两人之间一闪而过的暗号当作一个不祥之兆。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Now, whether a peculiar contraction of the Jew's red eye-brows, and a half closing of his deeply-set eyes, warned Miss Nancy that she was disposed to be too communicative, is not a matter of much importance. The fact is all we need care for here; and the fact is, that she suddenly checked herself, and with several gracious smiles upon Mr. Sikes, turned the conversation to other matters. In about ten minutes" time, Mr. Fagin was seized with a fit of coughing; upon which Nancy pulled her shawl over her shoulders, and declared it was time to go. Mr. Sikes, finding that he was walking a short part of her way himself, expressed his intention of accompanying her; they went away together, followed, at a little distant, by the dog, who slunk out of a back-yard as soon as his master was out of sight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当时，费金那赤红的眉毛怪里怪气地皱了起来，深陷的双眼半睁半闭，他是不是在向藏不住话的南希小姐发出警告，这并不重要。我们需要留意的是以下事实，那就是，她忽然打住，向赛克斯先生抛过去几道妩媚的微笑，话锋一转谈起别的事情来了。过了大约十分钟，费金先生使劲咳嗽了几声，南希见他这副模样，便用围巾裹住肩膀，说她该走了。赛克斯先生想起自己和她有一段同路，表示有意要陪陪她，两人一块儿走了，隔不多远跟着那只狗，主人刚走出视野，狗就打后院溜了出去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Jew thrust his head out of the room door when Sikes had left it; looked after him as we walked up the dark passage; shook his clenched fist; muttered a deep curse; and then, with a horrible grin, reseated himself at the table; where he was soon deeply absorbed in the interesting pages of the Hue-and-Cry.</div>

Darkness had set in; it was a low neighborhood; no help was near; resistance was useless. In another moment he was dragged into a labyrinth of dark narrow courts, and was forced along them at a pace which rendered the few cries he dared to give utterance to, unintelligible. It was of little moment, indeed, whether they were intelligible or no; for there was nobody to care for them, had they been ever so plain.</div>
