<div class="line_en">They walked slowly across the field and down the hill to the old Perkins place. There were four or five cars parked outside. His father raised the knocker. Jess could hear P. T. barking from the back of the house and rushing to the door.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Hush, P. T.," a voice which Jess did not know said. "Down." The door was opened by a man who was half leaning over to hold the dog back. At the sight of Jess, P. T. snatched himself loose and leapt joyfully upon the boy. Jess picked him up and rubbed the back of the dog's neck as he used to when P. T. was a tiny puppy.</div>

<div class="line_en">They went into the golden room, and it was just the same, except more beautiful because the sun was pouring through the south windows. Four or five people Jess had never seen before were sitting about, whispering some, but mostly not talking at all. There was no place to sit down, but the strange man was bringing chairs from the dining room. The three of them sat down stiffly and waited, not knowing what to wait for.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们进了那间金色的房间，一切都和以前一样，只是更加美丽了，因为阳光洒在了整个房间里。四五个杰斯从未见过的人坐在这，小声说着话，但更多的人则是一语不发。这里已经没有地方坐了，但是那个奇怪的人从餐厅搬来了几把椅子，于是他们三个就呆呆地坐下来等候，但却不知道在等什么。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Leslie's grandmother shook his mother's and then his father's hands. "Thank you for coming," she said. Then she turned to Jess. "You must be Jess," she said. Jess nodded. "Leslie --" Her eyes filled up with tears. "Leslie told me about you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莱斯利的姥姥和他妈妈握了握手，又和他爸爸握了握手，“感谢你们的到来。”她说，然后转向杰斯，“你一定是杰斯。”她说道。杰斯点了点头。“莱斯利……”眼泪在她的眼眶里打转。“莱斯利向我提起过你。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">An older woman got up slowly from the couch and came over to Jess's mother. Her eyes were red under her perfectly white hair. "I'm Leslie's grandmother," she said, putting out her hand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一个年老的女人慢慢地从沙发上站起来，走向了杰斯的妈妈。她全白的头发下有一双哭红了的眼睛，“我是莱斯利的姥姥。”她说着，伸出了她的手。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For a minute Jess thought she was going to say something else. He didn't want to look at her, so he gave himself over to rubbing P. T., who was hanging across his lap. "I'm sorry --" Her voice broke. "I can't bear it." The man who had opened the door came up and put his arm around her. As he was leading her out of the room, Jess could hear her crying.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有那么一会儿，杰斯觉得她要说起别的事情了。他不想看着她，于是便抚摸起在他膝盖边上转悠的P.T。，它就挂在他的腿上。“我很抱歉……”她的声音颤抖，“我承受不了这件事。”那个开门的人走了过来，用手搂住了她。等她走出房间，杰斯还能听见她的哭泣声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was glad she was gone. There was something weird about a woman like that crying. It was as if the lady who talked about Polident on TV had suddenly burst into tears. It didn't fit. He looked around at the room full of red-eyed adults. Look at me, he wanted to say to them. I'm not crying. A part of him stepped back and examined this thought. He was the only person his age he knew whose best friend had died. It made him important. The kids at school Monday would probably whisper around him and treat him with respect -- the way they'd all treated Billy Joe Weems last year after his father had been killed in a car crash. He wouldn't have to talk to anybody if he didn't want to, and all the teachers would be especially nice to him. Momma would even make the girls be nice to him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他很高兴她离开了。像那样的女人哭起来真的很奇怪。就像一个女士在电视上谈起保丽净时忽然哭起来一样。这可不合适。他环顾四周，满是眼睛泛红的大人。他想跟他们说，你们都看看我。但是他并没有这么说。他是他知道的同龄人里唯一一个最好的朋友去世的人。这让他变得很重要。周一，学校里的同学都会互相窃窃私语，用恭敬的目光看着他，安慰他，就像去年安慰爸爸在车祸中去世的比利·乔·威姆斯那样。如果他不愿意的话，他可以不跟任何人说话，所有的老师都会对他特别好。连妈妈也会让那些女孩子对自己好点。【注：Polident，一种用于清洁假牙的产品。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Jess." Bill came over to him and put his arms around him as though he had been Leslie instead of himself. Bill held him close, so that a button on his sweater was pressing painfully into Jess's forehead, but as uncomfortable as he was, Jess didn't move. He could feel Bill's body shaking, and he was afraid that if he looked up he would see Bill crying, too. He didn't want to see Bill crying. He wanted to get out of this house. It was smothering him. Why wasn't Leslie here to help him out of this? Why didn't she come running in and make everyone laugh again? You think it's so great to die and make everyone cry and carry on. Well, it ain't.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“杰斯。”比尔向他走过去，双手环抱着他，就像是在抱着莱斯利一样。他搂的如此之紧，以至于他毛衣上的扣子压疼了杰斯的额头，但是尽管这非常不舒服，他还是没有动，他能感觉到比尔的身子在发抖，他害怕抬头看到比尔正在哭泣。他不想看到比尔哭，他想离开这幢房子，这里使他窒息，为什么莱斯利不能帮他离开这里？为什么她能不跑过来，让每个人再次露出微笑？你觉得这样很棒，让每个人哭泣然后继续生活。不，一点也不好。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He had a sudden desire to see Leslie laid out. He wondered if she were back in the library or in Millsburg at one of the funeral parlors. Would they bury her in blue jeans? Or maybe that blue jumper and the flowery blouse she'd worn Easter. That would be nice. People might snicker at the blue jeans, and he didn't want anyone to snicker at Leslie when she was dead.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他忽然想看看莱斯利被放在哪。他想知道她是被安放回了图书馆，还是米尔斯堡的某个殡仪馆。他们会给她穿上蓝色的牛仔裤埋葬她吗？或者是复活节穿的蓝色的连衣裙和缀花上衣。那也一定很好看。人们也许会嘲笑蓝色的牛仔裤，而他不希望任何人在莱斯利死后还去嘲笑她。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Bill didn't sound like himself. He sounded like someone in an old mushy movie. The kind of person Leslie and Jess would laugh at and imitate later. Boo-hooooooo, you were such a wonderful friend to her. He couldn't help moving back, just enough to get his forehead off the stupid button. To his relief, Bill let go. He heard his father ask Bill quietly over his head about "the service."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="比尔的声音听起来不像是他自己，而像一个古老、模糊的电影里的人发出的。那种杰斯和莱斯利每次听到都会捧腹大笑，然后试图模仿的声音。嘘——呼，你是她如此要好的一个朋友。他忍不住向后退了一下，好让额头离开那个愚蠢的纽扣。如他所愿，比尔放开了他。杰斯听见他爸爸越过他的头顶，小声询问比尔关于“仪式”的事情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And Bill answering quietly almost in his regular voice that they had decided to have the body cremated and were going to take the ashes to his family home in Pennsylvania tomorrow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="比尔小声地回答了这些问题，声音几乎跟平常一样，他们决定火化她的遗体，明天把骨灰送回她宾夕法尼亚州的家乡。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"She loved you, you know." He could tell from Bill's voice that he was crying. "She told me once that if it weren't for you…" His voice broke completely. "Thank you," he said a moment later. "Thank you for being such a wonderful friend to her."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“她喜欢你，你知道的。”他能从比尔的声音中听出来他已经哭了。“她曾告诉过我，如果没有你……”他的声音完全梗咽了，“谢谢你。”过了一小会儿，他说：“谢谢你成为她这么好的朋友。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Cremated. Something clicked inside Jess's head. That meant Leslie was gone. Turned to ashes. He would never see her again. Not even dead. Never. How could they dare? Leslie belonged to him. More to him than anyone in the world. No one had even asked him. No one had even told him. And now he was never going to see her again, and all they could do was cry. Not for Leslie. They weren't crying for Leslie. They were crying for themselves. Just themselves. If they'd cared at all for Leslie, they would have never brought her to this rotten place. He had to hold tightly to his hands for fear he might sock Bill in the face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="火化。杰斯脑中一个激灵。这表示莱斯利将不复存在。变成了骨灰。他永远也不能再见到她了。连死后也不能。永远。他们怎么敢这么做？莱斯利是属于他的。比世界上任何其他的人都要多。然而没有人问过他的意见，甚至没有人告诉他。现在，他永远见不到她了，现在他们能做的只有哭泣。不是为了莱斯利。他们不是在为莱斯利哭泣。他们是在为自己哭泣。只是为了自己。如果他们真的关心莱斯利，那他们绝不会把她带到这个烂地方。他不得不紧紧的把持住自己的手，因为他害怕自己会扇比尔耳光。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He, Jess, was the only one who really cared for Leslie. But Leslie had failed him. She went and died just when he needed her the most. She went and left him. She went swinging on that rope just to show him that she was no coward. So there, Jess Aarons. She was probably somewhere right now laughing at him. Making fun of him like he was Mrs. Myers. She had tricked him. She had made him leave his old self behind and come into her world, and then before he was really at home in it but too late to go back, she had left him stranded there -- like an astronaut wandering about on the moon. Alone.</div>

The paints floated on top, riding the current like a boat, but the papers swirled about, soaking in the muddy water, being sucked down, around, and down. He watched them all disappear. Gradually his breath quieted, and his heart slowed from its wild pace. The ground was still muddy from the rains, but he sat down anyway. There was nowhere to go. Nowhere. Ever again. He put his head down on his knee.</div>
