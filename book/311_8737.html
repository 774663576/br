<div class="line_en">She thought about sneaking out again, but the risk was incomprehensible, and it was so effing cold out she'd probably lose an ear to frostbite. Which her mom would definitely notice.</div>

<div class="line_en">She'd already noticed the mascara. (Even though it was brown and said "Subtle, Natural Look" right on the package.)</div>

<div class="line_en">It would be awful if her mom actually met Tina somewhere, but that didn't seem likely -- her mom never talked to anybody in the neighborhood. If you weren't born in the Flats (if your family didn't go back ten generations, if your parents didn't have the same great-great-grandparents), you were an outsider.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果她妈妈真的遇上提娜就完了，不过可能性不高，妈妈从不跟街坊邻居来往。如果你不是出生在佛列兹（也就是如果你的家族没有在这里住过至少十代，如果你爸妈的曾曾祖父母不是同一个人），那么，你在佛列兹就是外人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">If she just changed Park's name to "Tina" every time she lied, it only felt like one big lie instead of a million small ones.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="每次她说谎，只要把帕克的名字换成提娜就行，与其撒千百个小谎，不如撒一个弥天大谎。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was kind of funny to think about hanging out at Tina's house every day, doing each other's nails, trying on lip gloss…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="只要想到自己每天跟提娜混在一起，互相涂指甲油，试用唇膏，她就觉得好笑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Park always said that was why people left him alone, even though he was weird and Asian. Because his family had owned their land back when the neighborhood was still cornfields.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="帕克总是说，虽然他是个奇怪的亚洲人，人们也不来烦他，是因为这附近还是玉米田时他们家就住在这儿了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Park. Eleanor blushed whenever she thought about him. She'd probably always done that, but now it was worse. Because he was cute and cool before, but lately he seemed so much more of both.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃莉诺每次想到帕克就脸红。或许她一向如此，只是现在更糟了。因为帕克以前就又可爱又酷，最近，这两者都成倍增长。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He looked like himself, Eleanor thought, but bolder. Like Park with the volume turned way up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃莉诺则认为他看起来像他自己，只是更大胆无畏了。像“音量全开”的帕克。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Eleanor wasn't diffusing, but she was using the conditioner Park's mom had given her. And she'd actually found a satin pillowcase in the stack of towels and stuff in her bedroom closet, which was practically a sign from God that He wanted Eleanor to take better care of her hair.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃莉诺没吹头发，但是用了帕克妈妈给她的护发素。而她居然在卧室柜子的毛巾堆里找到一个绸缎枕套，简直就像上帝的信息：埃莉诺，你要好好照顾你的头发。">查看中文翻译</div>
