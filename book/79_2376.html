<div class="line_en">She smiled a little in the darkness, his seed still trickling with slow warmth from between her slightly parted thighs, and her smile was both rueful and pleased, because the phrase her man summoned up a hundred feelings.

<div class="line_en">Now, moving away from her consciousness, she wondered how many beds she had slept in with this man beside her. They had met in college and had first made love in his apartment… that had been less than three months after her mother drove her from the house, told her never to come back, that if she wanted to go somewhere she could go to her father since she had been responsible for the divorce. That had been in 1970. So long ago? A semester later they had moved in together, had found jobs for the summer, and had kept the apartment when their senior year began. She remembered that bed the most clearly, a big double that sagged in the middle. When they made love, the rusty box spring had counted the beats. That fall she had finally managed to break from her mother. Jack had helped her. She wants to keep beating you, Jack had said. The more times you phone her, the more times you crawl back begging forgiveness, the more she can beat you with your father. It's good for her, Wendy, because she can go on making believe it was your fault. But it's not good for you. They had talked it over again and again in that bed, that year.</div>

<div class="line_en">(Jack sitting up with the covers pooled around his waist, a cigarette burning between his fingers, looking her in the eye -- he had a half-humorous, half-scowling way of doing that -- telling her: She told you never to come back, right? Never to darken her door again, right? Then why doesn't she hang up the phone when she knows it's you? Why does she only tell you that you can't come in if I'm with you? Because she thinks I might cramp her style a little bit. She wants to keep putting the thumbscrews right to you, baby. You're a fool if you keep letting her do it. She told you never to come back, so why don't you take her at her word? Give it a rest. And at last she'd seen it his way.)</div>

<div class="line_en">It had been Jack's idea to separate for a while -- to get perspective on the relationship, he said. She had been afraid he had become interested in someone else.

<div class="line_en">They had their first car, a five-year-old Buick with a baby seat in the middle. Bright, upwardly mobile young marrieds. Danny forced a reconciliation between her and her mother, a reconciliation that was always tense and never happy, but a reconciliation all the same. When she took Danny to the house, she went without Jack. And she didn't tell Jack that her mother always remade Danny's diapers, frowned over his formula, could always spot the accusatory first signs of a rash on the baby's bottom or privates. Her mother never said anything overtly, but the message came through anyway: the price she had begun to pay (and maybe always would) for the reconciliation was the feeling that she was an inadequate mother. It was her mother's way of keeping the thumbscrews handy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们有了第一辆车，一辆用了5年的别克牌，车上还有个婴儿座位。一对前途光明、蒸蒸日上的年轻夫妇。丹尼在她和母亲之间带来了和解，一种紧张的、不愉快的和解，但毕竟算得上是和解。每次带丹尼去看她母亲，她都不让杰克同去。她没有告诉杰克，她母亲每次都要把丹尼的尿布重新垫一遍，对丹尼的饮食配方皱眉头，总能在小宝贝的屁股上或小鸡鸡上发现生皮疹的兆头。她母亲从不明说什么，但是，她开始（也许会永远）为这种和解付出代价，即感到自己不是一个称职的母亲。这就是她母亲念紧箍咒的方式。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">That had been the best year, the best bed. After Danny was born, Jack had gotten her a job typing for half a dozen English Department profs-quizzes, exams, class syllabi, study notes, reading lists. She ended up tvping a novel for one of them, a novel that never got published… much to Jack's very irreverent and very private glee. The job was good for forty a week, and skyrocketed all the way up to sixty during the two months she spent typing the unsuccessful novel.</div>

<div class="line_en">In those days, Jack's drinking had still been well in hand. On Saturday nights a bunch of his fellow students would drop over and there would be a case of beer and discussions in which she seldom took part because her field had been sociology and his was English: arguments over whether Pepys's diaries were literature or history; discussions of Charles Olson's poetry; sometimes the reading of works in progress. Those and a hundred others. No, a thousand. She felt no real urge to take part; it was enough to sit in her rocking chair beside Jack, who sat cross-legged on the floor, one hand holding a beer, the other gently cupping her calf or braceleting her ankle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那些日子里，杰克喝酒还相当节制。每逢周六，杰克的一群学生就聚到他们家里，喝啤酒，侃大山。温迪几乎不参加他们的讨论，因为她的专业是社会学，而杰克的是英语。他们争论佩皮斯的日记属于文学还是历史；讨论查尔斯—奥尔森的诗；有时朗读尚待完成的新作。如此等等，话题千奇百怪。她无心加入，坐在杰克身边的摇椅里洗耳恭听，而杰克则盘腿坐在地板上，一只手抓着一瓶啤酒，另一只手轻轻捧着她的小腿肚或握着她的脚踝。">查看中文翻译</div>

She would put Danny in his crib, then read whatever Jack had written that night before waking him up enough to come to bed.</div>

<div class="line_en">At the end of his grad work he had landed the job at Stovington, mostly on the strength of his stories -- four of them published at that time, one of them in Esquire. She remembered that day clearly enough; it would take more than three years to forget it. She had almost thrown the envelope away, thinking it was a subscription offer. Opening it, she had found instead that it was a letter saying that Esquire would like to use Jack's story "Concerning the Black Holes" early the following year. They would pay nine hundred dollars, not on publication but on acceptance. That was nearly half a year's take typing papers and she had flown to the telephone, leaving Danny in his high chair to goggle comically after her, his face lathered with creamed peas and beef puree.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="完成研究生学业后，杰克在斯托文顿找到了工作，主要得益于他的短篇小说——当时已发表了4篇，其中之一发表在《绅士》上。3年多过去了，温迪对那一天的情景仍然记忆犹新。她以为又是征订广告，差点把那个信封扔了，打开一看，原来是封信。信上说，《绅士》将在下年年初采用杰克的小说《黑洞》，他们将暂付900美元认可费（而不是出版费）。这差不多等于她半年的打字收入！她飞也似的扑向了电话，丹尼坐在高高的椅子里瞪着她，模样滑稽，满脸都是奶油豌豆和牛肉酱。">查看中文翻译</div>

After a ceremonial toast (Wendy also had a glass, although she ordinarily had no taste for beer), Jack had signed the acceptance letter, put it in the return envelope, and went down the block to drop it in the letter box. When he came back he stood gravely in the door and said, "Veni, vidi, vici." There were cheers and applause.

He had tried to soothe the baby and dropped him on the floor. Wendy had rushed out, thinking of what her mother would think if she saw the bruise before she thought of anything else -- God help her, God help them both -- and then picked Danny up, sat in the rocking chair with him, soothed him. She had been thinking of her mother for most of the five hours Jack had been gone, her mother's prophecy that Jack would never come to anything. Big ideas, her mother had said. Sure. The welfare lines are full of educated fools with big ideas. Did the Esquire story make her mother wrong or right? Winnifred, you're not holding that baby right. Give him to me. And was she not holding her husband right? Why else would he take his joy out of the house?

<div class="line_en">Even after the accident -- if you could call it an accident -- she had not been able to bring it all the way out, to admit that her marriage was a lopsided defeat. She had waited, dumbly hoping that a miracle would occur and Jack would see what was happening, not only to him but to her. But there had been no slowdown. A drink before going off to the Academy. Two or three beers with lunch at the Stovington House. Three or four martinis before dinner. Five or six more while grading papers. The weekends were worse. The nights out with Al Shockley were worse still. She had never dreamed there could be so much pain in a life when there was nothing physically wrong. She hurt all the time. How much of it was her fault? That question haunted her. She felt like her mother. Like her father. Sometimes, when she felt like herself she wondered what it would be like for Danny, and she dreaded the day when he grew old enough to lay blame. And she wondered where they would go. She had no doubt her mother would take her in, and no doubt that after a year of watching her diapers remade, Danny's meals recooked and/or redistributed, of coming home to find his clothes changed or his hair cut or the books her mother found unsuitable spirited away to some limbo in the attic… after half a year of that, she would have a complete nervous breakdown. And her mother would pat her hand and say comfortingly, Although it's not your fault, it's all your own fault. You were never ready. You showed your true colors when you came between your father and me.</div>

He would take Danny with him in the car to get the paper or a bottle of milk or nails at the hardware store even when their son was still an infant.
