<div class="line_en">It's almost seven in the evening when FatPanda leaves the rain-streaked building on Datong Road. June in Shanghai is a time of sweltering humidity and frequent downpours. The roads and pavements shine, cars and trucks hiss by in a shudder of exhaust, and the heat rises in waves from the wet tarmac. FatPanda is neither a young man nor a fit one, and his shirt is soon clinging sweatily to his back.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the eight years of its existence, the White Dragon crew has hit the best part of a hundred and fifty military and corporate targets. Initially in the U. S., more recently in Russia and Belarus. Like most of its victims, Talachyn has offered only token resistance. A week ago, a junior employee received an email that purported to come from the company's director of security, inviting him to click on a link for information about a new firewall. In fact, the link contained the ZeroT downloader, a remote-access tool designed by FatPanda, giving his crew the run of Talachyn's operational files.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ignoring the crowds of home-going workers and the clammy heat, FatPanda walks unhurriedly through the evening haze of the Pudong district, gazing around him with admiration at the city's trophy skyscrapers. At the soaring glass column of the Shanghai Tower, the silver-blue sliver of the World Financial Centre, and the vast, pagoda-like Jin Mao Tower. That things are rather less spectacular at street level, where beggars rummage through garbage-bins, is not of concern to FatPanda.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="胖熊猫不顾闷热的天气和回家的上班族的人群，不慌不忙地走在浦东新区的薄雾中，他带着欣赏的眼光环顾四周，注视着这座城市的摩天大楼、上海塔高耸的玻璃墙、世界金融中心的银蓝银条，以及雄伟庄严的金茂大厦。街头的乞丐在垃圾桶里翻着，让风景变得不那么引人入胜了，但胖熊猫对此并不关心。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Since these relate to classified fighter-jet designs they will be of particular interest to FatPanda's superiors in Beijing. For the White Dragon group are not, as some have thought them, merely a gratuitously destructive team of hackers and anarchists. They are an elite cyber-warfare unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, engaged in targeted attacks on foreign corporations, military intelligence systems and infrastructure. The anonymous-looking building on Datong Road has been fitted out with banks of powerful computer servers and high-speed fibre-optic lines, all of them cooled by precision air-conditioning systems. FatPanda, the team's leader, is Lieutenant Colonel Zhang Lei, and it was he who chose the crew's title. A moon-white dragon, according to Chinese symbolism, embodies a ferocious supernatural power. It is an omen of death. A warning.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="由于这些文件与机密的战斗机设计有关，它们使胖熊猫在中国的上级特别感兴趣。因为白龙队不像一些人所认为的那样，仅仅是一个由黑客和无政府主义者组成的毫无意义的破坏性团队。他们是中国人民解放军的一支精英网络战部队，对外国公司、军事情报系统和基础设施进行有针对性的攻击。大同路这座匿名建筑配备了一排功能强大的计算机服务器和高速光纤线路，由精密空调系统制冷。队长胖熊猫，是中校张磊，是他选择了团队的名字。根据中国的象征意义，月亮和白龙象征着一种凶猛的超自然力量。这是一种死亡的预兆。一种警告。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The information they've acquired, and the identities of FatPanda and his team, have been passed up the line. As yet, no Western or Russian administration has risked confrontation with Beijing by directly accusing the People's Liberation Army of state-sponsored data-theft; the diplomatic fallout would be too damaging. But others have been less concerned with such sensitivities. The predations of White Dragon have cost their victims billions of dollars over the years, and a group of individuals, collectively more powerful than any government, has decided that it is time to act.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们获取的信息，和胖熊猫及他的团队的身份，都被传到了网上。迄今为止，没有任何一个西方国家或者俄罗斯政府，冒着与北京对抗的风险，直接指责中国人民解放军窃取国家资助的数据；但其他人则不太关心这种敏感性。这些年来，白龙的捕食已经使受害者损失了数十亿美元，而一群比任何政府都强大的个人已经决定采取行动。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He is, in many ways, a clever and even brilliant man. He is certainly a lethal cyber-warrior. But success has led FatPanda to make a cardinal strategic error: he has underestimated his enemy. While he and his crew have been rummaging through the intellectual property of foreign corporations, diverting terabytes of secret data to Beijing, the world's intelligence agencies and private security firms have not been idle. Their analysts have been amassing their own data: identifying Internet protocol addresses, reverse-engineering the White Dragon crew's malware, and following their actions keystroke by keystroke.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在各个方面，他是一个聪明的，甚至可以称得上睿智的男人。他确实是一位致命的网络战士。但是成功使胖熊猫翻了一个巨大的战略错误：他低估了敌人。尽管他和他的团队一直在搜寻外国公司的知识产权，将数兆的机密数据转移到北京，但世界情报机构和私人安全公司却没有闲着。他们的分析人员一直在积累自己的数据：识别互联网协议地址，反向操纵白龙工作人员的恶意软件，并依照他们的行动反击。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">FatPanda proceeds through the crowds and the diesel fumes of Pudong towards the Dongchang Road ferry terminal. He has been trained in the techniques of counter-surveillance, but it has been some years since he practised them with any real assiduity. He is on his own turf, and his enemies are continents away, little more than flickering usernames behind transparent passwords. That his actions could have deadly consequences has never seriously occurred to him.</div>

<div class="line_en">Perhaps this is why, as he steps onto the ferry, he takes no notice of the young man in the business suit, just metres behind him, who has tailed him from his office, and who speaks briefly into his phone before vanishing into the hurrying throng on Dongchang Road. Or perhaps it's just that Lieutenant Colonel Zhang Lei's mind is elsewhere. For this prince of cyber-spies has a secret of his own, of which his colleagues know nothing. A secret which, as the ferry noses into the polluted currents of the Huangpu river, charges him with a dark thrill of anticipation.</div>

<div class="line_en">He looks ahead of him, seeing and not seeing the illuminated panorama of the Bund, the kilometre-long waterfront on which stand the landmark edifices of old Shanghai. His gaze traverses the former banks and trading houses without interest. These monuments to colonial power are now luxury hotels, restaurants and clubs, the playground of rich tourists and the financial elite. His own destination lies beyond this gilded facade.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他望向前方，外滩的全景若隐若现，外滩有一公里长的海滨，上面矗立着旧上海的标志性建筑。他的目光穿过从前的银行和贸易公司，对它们毫无兴趣。这些殖民地政权的纪念碑现在成了豪华的酒店、餐馆和俱乐部、富有游客的游乐场和金融精英的聚居地。他自己的目的地就在这镀金的建筑物之外。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As he leaves the ferry at the South Bund terminal FatPanda performs a cursory sweep of his surroundings, but once again fails to register the operative reporting his progress, this time a young woman in the uniform of a hotel employee. Fifteen minutes later, he has left the Bund behind him, and is hurrying through the narrow, intersecting alleyways of the Old City. This district, teeming with shoppers and tourists, fragrant with moped exhaust and the fatty tang of street-food, is a far cry from the monumental splendour of the Bund. The pinched lanes are hung with laundry and loops of electrical cable, stalls attended by squatting women are piled high with rain-damp produce, tiny shops behind bamboo-pole awnings sell fake antiques and retro-styled girly calendars. As FatPanda turns a corner a pimp on a scooter gestures towards a dimly lit interior in which rows of young prostitutes wait and whisper.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当他离开南外滩码头的渡船时，胖熊猫粗略地扫了一下周围的环境，仍旧没能注意到正报告他的进展情况的特工，这次是一名身着酒店员工制服的年轻女子。十五分钟后，他把外滩抛在身后，匆匆穿过老城狭窄交叉的小巷。这个区域到处都是购物者和游客，散发着汽车废气和街边食物的油腻味道，与外滩的壮丽景色相去甚远。狭窄的小巷里挂满了洗过的衣服和电线，女人们蹲坐在摊位上，竹竿雨棚上盛满了湿透的雨水，后面的小商店里出售假古董和画着女人的复古日历。当胖熊猫拐过一个角落时，一个骑摩托车的皮条客朝着一个灯光暗淡的室内做手势，里面有一排年轻的妓女在等着，她们低声说话。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The first floor is given over to more or less conventional sexual pleasures. As FatPanda climbs the stairs he is afforded a glimpse, through a briefly opening door, of a pink-lit room and a girl in a baby-doll nightie.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一楼差不多是传统的提供性爱的地方。当胖熊猫上楼之后，他从一扇半开的门中，瞥见了粉色的房间和一个穿着娃娃睡衣的女孩。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The second floor is altogether more specialist. FatPanda is met by an unsmiling young woman dressed in a crisp green and white skirted uniform. She wears a starched cap pinned to her upswept hair, a surgical mask, and a transparent plastic apron which rustles as she moves. She smells of some austere disinfectant. A name tag pinned to her chest identifies her as Nurse Wu.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“脱掉你的衣服躺下来，”她命令道，指着粉色的病号服。这件病号服甚至遮不住胖熊猫的屁股，当她在轮床上坐着的时候，他的生殖器暴露在外，让他感到极度的、令人兴奋的脆弱。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Beginning with his arms, Nurse Wu begins to fasten a series of canvas and Velcro restraints, pulling the cuffs so tightly around FatPanda's chest, thighs and ankles that he is completely immobilised.

<div class="line_en">FatPanda manages a faint groan from inside the mask. His panicked eyes skid around. For an instant, inches in front of his face, Nurse Wu's plastic apron falls forward and her gown parts to reveal a plump crotch in a pair of utilitarian, possibly military-issue, knickers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="胖熊猫在面具里发出微弱的呻吟声。他惊慌的眼睛转来转去。片刻之后，吴护士的塑料围裙在他面前几英寸的地方掀了起来，露出了丰满的胯部和一双实用的，可能是军用的衬裤。">查看中文翻译</div>

Soon, his penis is rearing and twitching like a marionette. Laying down the razor, her eyes thoughtful above the three-ply surgical mask, Nurse Wu reaches for a pair of locking forceps from the tray. Holding them briefly in front of his face, she clamps the sharp teeth of the forceps onto the base of his scrotum. FatPanda looks up at her adoringly, tears of pain running down his cheeks. Once again, as if by the sheerest accident, he is permitted a glimpse of Nurse Wu's pillowy pudenda. He hears the clink of metal, feels the forceps lifted, and a moment later feels a fiery sensation tearing across his perineum.</div>

In the Dangfeng house a back stair leads to the exit, and it is this that Villanelle now takes, having changed from her surgical uniform. Outside, the streets are humid, and still teeming with tourists and strolling families, and no one takes any notice of a young Western woman wearing a baseball cap and carrying a small backpack. When pressed -- and in the days and weeks to come there will be hard questions asked in the lanes and alleyways of the Old Town -- one or two observers will recall that the woman's cap carried the insignia of the New York Yankees, and that her dark-blonde hair was worn in a ponytail, and from these slender impressions will be born the rumour that the suspect is an American.

<div class="line_en">Of all those humiliations, it's her rejection by the French teacher, Anna Ivanovna Leonova, that she still feels most keenly. A single woman in her late twenties, Leonova was more than a little awed by her troubled pupil's precocious linguistic gifts, and ignoring Oxana's rudeness and gracelessness, determined to open her eyes to a world beyond the grey confines of Perm. So there were weekend sessions in Anna's tiny apartment, discussing Colette and Françoise Sagan, and on one memorable occasion a visit to the Tchaikovsky Theatre, to see a performance of the opera Manon Lescaut.</div>

<div class="line_en">Oxana was bemused by the attention. No one had ever expended so much time on her. What Anna Ivanovna was giving her, she realised, was something selfless, something close to love. Intellectually, Oxana understood such an emotion, but she also knew herself incapable of feeling it. Physical desire, though, was another matter, and she lay awake, night after night, tortured by a raw longing for her teacher that she could find no way of expressing beyond a sullen blankness.</div>

Since her recruitment by Edwards to investigate the Kedrin killing, an operation run strictly off-the-books, Eve has not contacted a single one of her former colleagues. Instead, day after day, week after week, she has made her way to the cramped and dingy office over Goodge Street tube station. There, with the long-suffering Simon, she has scrolled through file after classified file, staring at her computer screen until her head pounds and her eyes ache with tiredness, in the search for anything -- a whisper, an afterthought, the ghost of a suggestion -- that might lead her closer to the woman who murdered Viktor Kedrin.</div>

The woman she sometimes calls Chernaya Roza -- Black Rose -- after the 9mm Russian hollowpoint ammunition used to kill Kedrin and his bodyguards. Eve thinks that her Black Rose is in her mid-twenties, highly intelligent, and a loner. She is audacious, cool under pressure, and supremely skilled at compartmentalising her emotions. In all probability she is a sociopath, wholly lacking in affect and conscience. She will have few or no friends, and such relationships as she forms will be overwhelmingly manipulative and sexual in nature. Killing, in all probability, will have become necessary to her, with each successful murder further proof of her untouchability.</div>

<div class="line_en">For some minutes, the niceties are observed on both sides. Jin is a quietly spoken figure in a dove-grey suit. He speaks English with a faint American accent. At intervals a look of refined melancholy touches his features, as if he's saddened by the vagaries of human behaviour.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="几分钟之间，两边都在观察对方的细节。金是一个说话轻声细语的人，穿着斑鸠灰色的西装。他说的英语带有微弱的美国口音。一种精致的忧郁不时地浮上他的脸，仿佛他为人类行为的变幻莫测感到悲伤。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">An hour later, Villanelle is strolling down one of the many aisles of Putua Parlour, noting the positioning of the CCTV cameras. It's a warehouse store for the restaurant trade, offering every imaginable appliance and vessel. Shelf after shelf is piled high with pans, skillets, steamers, hotpots, baking dishes and gleaming tinware. There are elaborate cake stands, fantastical jelly-moulds, and an entire aisle of woks. Tiny woks for flash-frying individual prawns, jacuzzi-sized woks capacious enough for a whole ox.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the last aisle, Villanelle finds what she's looking for. Cleavers. Fine-bladed cleavers for slicing and dicing, heavy bone-choppers for hacking and dismembering. Her eye alights on a chukabocho, a locally made cleaver with a 25oz carbon-steel blade and a tiger-maple handle. It feels good in her hand. Two minutes later she checks out, paying for a dozen cocktail glasses and several sets of paper umbrellas. Somehow, unseen by the CCTV cameras, the chukabocho has made its way to the bottom of her shoulder bag.</div>

<div class="line_en">There was a girl at university, an Eng Lit student who played in a ukelele band. She and Simon slept together intermittently, but he was never quite sure what she expected from him, and eventually the relationship faded into a friendship with which they were both more comfortable. He wondered, vaguely, if he was gay, and in the spirit of experiment, allowed himself to be seduced by his male tutor, a mediaevalist with a penchant for Gregorian plainchant and spanking. That didn't really work out either, and Simon decided to let the whole sex thing slide, and to concentrate on his studies. He left with a first-class degree and an unfocused sense of longing. For what or for whom, he didn't know. For almost a year he lived at home, celibate and unemployed. Then one day, almost as a joke, a friend emailed him a link to MI5's recruitment page. From day one, the secret world felt like home.</div>

<div class="line_en">Two dragon-fruit Martinis later (Sprite for her, touchingly), they're dancing. The playlist is commercial pop, and Janie sings along to every track. Simon's not much of a dancer, but the floor's too crowded to do more than shuffle and nod. The tempo slows, and he places his hands on her hips, feeling their gentle sway, inhaling the scent of the jasmine blooms pinned to her upswept hair. Intoxicated, he draws her towards him, and she lays her head on his shoulder. Through his jacket, which he dares not remove for fear that it will be stolen, he feels the unyielding pressure of her breasts. His heart pounding, he touches his lips to the soft tendrils of hair at her temple. He doesn't think she'll sense this but she does, and her face tilts up to his, her lips parted.</div>

Now she touches his clothes, running her fingers over the jacket he's slung over the single chair. A slim hand disappears, and an instant later reappears holding his phone.

But the little hooker fucked up, and once Simon Mortimer saw Konstantin, he couldn't be allowed to live. That's the way she's going to argue it, anyway. The killing will almost certainly be blamed on the Triads, whose traditional murder weapon is the cleaver. Polastri will get the message loud and clear, but as far as everyone else is concerned -- the press, the police -- Simon Mortimer's just going to be a tourist who found himself in the wrong place, at the wrong time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最美妙的是，她别无选择。康斯坦丁已经命令过杰妮，让她确保自己不会被跟踪到约会地点，并且在有必要时给英国人下毒。但是那个消极女搞砸了，一旦西蒙·莫蒂默看到康斯坦丁，他就不能再活下去了。无论如何，她打算这样争辩。这起谋杀案几乎肯定会被归咎于三合会，他们的传统凶器就是大砍刀。波拉斯特里会得到清晰、明确的消息，但对于其他人而言——新闻界，警察界——西蒙·莫蒂默只是一个游客，在错误的时间呆在了错误的地点。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Eve's lying with her mouth slightly open and one arm flung across the pillow. She's wearing a flesh-coloured camisole, and without make-up looks unexpectedly vulnerable. Kneeling beside her, Villanelle listens to the whisper of her breath, and inhales her warm smell. Noting the faint tremor of Eve's mouth, she touches her tongue to her own upper lip which has begun, very faintly, to throb.</div>

<div class="line_en">Almost as an afterthought, she searches the room. There's a combination-locked briefcase chained to the bed she decides to leave alone. But on the bedside table, there's a pretty, gilt-clasped eternity bracelet, and this Villanelle takes.</div>

<div class="line_en">It's five weeks later, and at midday the grey sky over the Dever Research Station promises rain. Set in sixty acres outside the village of Bullington in Hampshire, the former Logistics Corps barracks appears from the outside to comprise little more than a cluster of dilapidated red-brick blocks and prefabricated huts. Chain-link fencing topped with razor wire and signs prohibiting photography lend the place a grimly uninviting aspect.</div>

With the exception of a couple of security personnel who are making an unhurried circuit of the perimeter, the place appears deserted.

Fifteen seconds pass, during which the only sound is the sigh of the ventilators and a metallic clicking as Eve assembles the Glock. Then a target, a human torso, is briefly illuminated at the far end of the range and she snaps off two shots, the muzzle flash bright in the darkness. Four more static targets appear, and Eve fires paired shots at each. The final target moves from side to side, and she discharges the last five rounds in her magazine in fast succession.</div>
