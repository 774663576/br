<div class="line_en">It was Boggs who knocked out Peeta with one blow before any permanent damage could be done. I know Haymitch would have come to my defense if he hadn't been utterly unprepared. To catch both Haymitch and myself off guard is a rare thing. But we have been so consumed with saving Peeta, so tortured by having him in the Capitol's hands, that the elation at having him back blinded us. If I'd had a private reunion with Peeta, he would have killed me. Now that he's deranged.</div>

<div class="line_en">The cold collar chafes my neck and makes the shivering even harder to control. At least I am no longer in the claustrophobic tube, while the machines click and whir around me, listening to a disembodied voice telling me to hold still while I try to convince myself I can still breathe.

Where, I want to ask, is the doctor who determines if I am losing my mind? Only I'm not supposed to talk right now. I can't even thank Boggs when he comes to check on me.

<div class="line_en">Prim, who appeared moments after the attack and has stayed as close to me as possible ever since, spreads another blanket over me. "I think they'll take the collar off soon, Katniss. You won't be so cold then." My mother, who's been assisting in a complicated surgery, has still not been informed of Peeta's assault. Prim takes one of my hands, which is clutched in a fist, and massages it until it opens and blood begins to flow through my fingers again. She's starting on the second fist when the doctors show up, remove the collar, and give me a shot of something for pain and swelling. I lie, as instructed, with my head still, not aggravating the injuries to my neck.</div>

I don't know if they've told Gale, but since he's not here, I assume they haven't. Plutarch ushers the doctors out and triesto order Prim to go as well, but she says, "No. If you force me to leave, I'll go directly to surgery and tell my mother everything that's happened.

<div class="line_en">"So, Katniss, Peeta's condition has come as a shock to all of us," says Plutarch. "We couldn't help but notice his deterioration in the last two interviews. Obviously, he'd been abused, and we put his psychological state down to that. Now we believe something more was going on. That the Capitol has been subjecting him to a rather uncommon technique known as hijacking. Beetee?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是这样，凯特尼斯，皮塔的状况让我们所有人都感到吃惊。”普鲁塔什说，“在前两次电视访谈时，我们就注意到他的状况越来越糟。显然，他遭受了虐待，我们认为他不良的心理状态就是由此导致的。可现在我们推测，导致他目前状况的原因还不止这些。凯匹特在他身上使用了一种极为罕见的技术，叫做劫持。比特？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm sorry," Beetee says, "but I can't tell you all the specifics of it, Katniss. The Capitol's very secretive about this form of torture, and I believe the results are inconsistent. This we do know. It's a type of fear conditioning. The term hijack comes from an old English word that means 'to capture,'or even better, 'seize.' We believe it was chosen because the technique involves the use of tracker jacker venom, and the jack suggested hijack. You were stung in your first Hunger Games, so unlike most of us, you have firsthand knowledge of the effects of the venom."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“对不起。”比特说，“我无法把所有的细节都给你解释清楚，凯特尼斯。凯匹特对这种折磨人的手法十分保密，我相信受害者的情况是很不稳定的。我们所知道的是，这是一种恐惧感调节机制。劫持一词来自古老的英语，它的意思是‘捕获’，或者说得更确切点儿是‘抓住’。我们认为之所以使用这个词是因为这种技术和杀人蜂毒的介入有关，杀人蜂杀人首先要把人‘抓住’，因此这种技术叫劫持。你在第一次参加饥饿游戏时被杀人蜂叮咬过，所以和我们不同的是，你对蜂毒有亲身感受。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I'm sure you remember how frightening it was. Did you also suffer mental confusion in the aftermath?" asks Beetee. "A sense of being unable to judge what was true and what was false? Most people who have been stung and lived to tell about it report something of the kind."</div>

Now imagine that I ask you to remember something -- either with a verbal suggestion or by making you watch a tape of the event -- and while that experience is refreshed, I give you a dose of tracker jacker venom. Not enough to induce a three-day blackout. Just enough to infuse the memory with fear and doubt. And that's what your brain puts in long-term storage."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“因为记忆系统也发生改变，所以受害者很难回忆起从前的事情。”比特敲敲他的前额说，“它把人的记忆集中到大脑最前端，然后人为地加以改变，之后再以改变后的形式储存起来。你现在设想一下，比如我让你记住一件事——不管是通过语言交流或观看录像——然后趁新的记忆信号还没有消失的时候，给你一定剂量的蜂毒。不会多到让你三天意识不清，但却足以在你的记忆里植入恐惧和疑虑。那么，这种感觉就会在你的记忆里长期储存起来。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Gale must have been released from the hospital this morning as well, because I find him in one of the research rooms with Beetee. They're immersed, heads bent over a drawing, taking a measurement. Versions of the picture litter the table and floor. Tacked on the corkboard walls and occupying several computer screens are other designs of some sort. In the rough lines of one, I recognize Gale's twitch-up snare. "What are these?" I ask hoarsely, pulling their attention from the sheet.</div>

<div class="line_en">This is what they've been doing. Taking the fundamental ideas behind Gale's traps and adapting them into weapons against humans. Bombs mostly. It's less about the mechanics of the traps than the psychology behind them. Booby-trapping an area that provides something essential to survival. A water or food supply. Frightening prey so that a large number flee into a greater destruction. Endangering offspring in order to draw in the actual desired target, the parent. Luring the victim into what appears to be a safe haven -- where death awaits it. At some point, Gale and Beetee left the wilderness behind and focused on more human impulses. Like compassion. A bomb explodes. Time is allowed for people to rush to the aid of the wounded. Then a second, more powerful bomb kills them as well.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这就是他们一直研究的武器。利用了盖尔圈套的基本原理，把它改造成打击人类的武器。应该说是一种炸弹。这件武器与其说是利用了圈套的机械原理，倒不如说发挥了它的心理机制。首先在一个区域内提供人类生存的基本条件，例如水源或者食物等等。然后对捕猎对象进行恐吓，致使更多的猎物落入圈套。将猎物的孩子置于危险之中，从而吸引真正的目标，也就是他们的父母。引诱猎物进入看似安全的地段，其实等待他们的是死亡。从某种意义上说，盖尔和比特的着眼点不是旷野，而是人类的自然反应，例如同情心。先引爆一颗炸弹，留出时间让其他人去救他们，这时引爆第二颗炸弹，炸死更多的人。">查看中文翻译</div>
