<div class="line_en">Small heart had Harriet for visiting. Only half an hour before her friend called for her at Mrs. Goddard's, her evil stars had led her to the very spot where, at that moment, a trunk, directed to The Rev. Philip Elton, White-Hart, Bath, was to be seen under the operation of being lifted into the butcher's cart, which was to convey it to where the coaches past; and every thing in this world, excepting that trunk and the direction, was consequently a blank.</div>

<div class="line_en">She went, however; and when they reached the farm, and she was to be put down, at the end of the broad, neat gravel walk, which led between espalier apple-trees to the front door, the sight of every thing which had given her so much pleasure the autumn before, was beginning to revive a little local agitation; and when they parted, Emma observed her to be looking around with a sort of fearful curiosity, which determined her not to allow the visit to exceed the proposed quarter of an hour. She went on herself, to give that portion of time to an old servant who was married, and settled in Donwell.</div>

<div class="line_en">Harriet could not very soon give an intelligible account. She was feeling too much; but at last Emma collected from her enough to understand the sort of meeting, and the sort of pain it was creating. She had seen only Mrs. Martin and the two girls. They had received her doubtingly, if not coolly; and nothing beyond the merest commonplace had been talked almost all the time -- till just at last, when Mrs. Martin's saying, all of a sudden, that she thought Miss Smith was grown, had brought on a more interesting subject, and a warmer manner. In that very room she had been measured last September, with her two friends. There were the pencilled marks and memorandums on the wainscot by the window. He had done it. They all seemed to remember the day, the hour, the party, the occasion-to feel the same consciousness, the same regrets-to be ready to return to the same good understanding; and they were just growing again like themselves, (Harriet, as Emma must suspect, as ready as the best of them to be cordial and happy,) when the carriage reappeared, and all was over. The style of the visit, and the shortness of it, were then felt to be decisive. Fourteen minutes to be given to those with whom she had thankfully passed six weeks not six months ago! -- Emma could not but picture it all, and feel how justly they might resent, how naturally Harriet must suffer. It was a bad business. She would have given a great deal, or endured a great deal, to have had the Martins in a higher rank of life. They were so deserving, that a little higher should have been enough: but as it was, how could she have done otherwise? -- Impossible! -- She could not repent. They must be separated; but there was a great deal of pain in the process -- so much to herself at this time, that she soon felt the necessity of a little consolation, and resolved on going home by way of Randalls to procure it. Her mind was quite sick of Mr. Elton and the Martins. The refreshment of Randalls was absolutely necessary.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈丽特一时讲不清楚事情的经过。她心里思绪万千。不过，爱玛最后还是听明白了这次会面的情况，以及这次会面引起的苦恼。原来，她只见到了马丁太太和两个姑娘。她们对她的接待，即便算不上冷淡，也是抱着怀疑的态度，而且几乎自始至终都只谈些极其平常的话——直至最后，马丁太太突然说起她觉得史密斯小姐长高了，这才扯起一个比较有趣的话题，几个人才变得比较热情一些。去年九月，就在这间屋里，她与她的两个朋友量过身高。窗户旁的护壁板上还留着铅笔标记和备忘记录。那都是马丁画上去的。他们似乎全都记得那一天，那一时刻，那一伙人，那一场合——有着同样的感受，同样的遗憾——准备恢复同样的亲密关系。几个朋友刚刚故态复萌（正如爱玛定会料到的，几个人中就数哈丽特最热忱、最快活），马车就回来了，一切也就结束了。这次回访的方式，时间的短促，当时就让人觉得丝毫也不含糊。不到六个月以前，她还欣然跟这家人一起过了六个星期，而这次却只能在他们家待上十四分钟！爱玛不难想象这一切，觉得这家人有理由表示忿懑，哈丽特自然会感到苦恼。这件事办得不好。她本来可以做出很大努力，或者忍受很多艰难困苦，把马丁家的地位提高一些。他们是很不错的，只要稍微提高一点就足够了。不过，实际上她又有什么办法呢？不可能有！她不会后悔。一定要把他们拆开。可是，在这过程中又引起了好多的痛苦——眼下她自己就感到很痛苦，不久就觉得需要寻求点安慰，便决定回家时取道兰多尔斯，从那里找些安慰。她心里十分讨厌埃尔顿先生和马丁家的人。到兰多尔斯去提提神，这是绝对必要的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"This is too bad," cried Emma, as they turned away. "And now we shall just miss them; too provoking! -- I do not know when I have been so disappointed." And she leaned back in the corner, to indulge her murmurs, or to reason them away; probably a little of both -- such being the commonest process of a not ill-disposed mind. Presently the carriage stopt; she looked up; it was stopt by Mr. and Mrs. Weston, who were standing to speak to her. There was instant pleasure in the sight of them, and still greater pleasure was conveyed in sound-for Mr. Weston immediately accosted her with,</div>

<div class="line_en">There was no resisting such news, no possibility of avoiding the influence of such a happy face as Mr. Weston's, confirmed as it all was by the words and the countenance of his wife, fewer and quieter, but not less to the purpose. To know that she thought his coming certain was enough to make Emma consider it so, and sincerely did she rejoice in their joy. It was a most delightful reanimation of exhausted spirits. The worn-out past was sunk in the freshness of what was coming; and in the rapidity of half a moment's thought, she hoped Mr. Elton would now be talked of no more.</div>

<div class="line_en">The word home made his father look on him with fresh complacency. Emma was directly sure that he knew how to make himself agreeable; the conviction was strengthened by what followed. He was very much pleased with Randalls, thought it a most admirably arranged house, would hardly allow it even to be very small, admired the situation, the walk to Highbury, Highbury itself, Hartfield still more, and professed himself to have always felt the sort of interest in the country which none but one's own country gives, and the greatest curiosity to visit it. That he should never have been able to indulge so amiable a feeling before, passed suspiciously through Emma's brain; but still, if it were a falsehood, it was a pleasant one, and pleasantly handled.

He did not advance a word of praise beyond what she knew to be thoroughly deserved by Mrs. Weston; but, undoubtedly he could know very little of the matter. He understood what would be welcome; he could be sure of little else. "His father's marriage," he said, "had been the wisest measure, every friend must rejoice in it; and the family from whom he had received such a blessing must be ever considered as having conferred the highest obligation on him."</div>

<div class="line_en">Her own father's perfect exemption from any thought of the kind, the entire deficiency in him of all such sort of penetration or suspicion, was a most comfortable circumstance. Happily he was not farther from approving matrimony than from foreseeing it. -- Though always objecting to every marriage that was arranged, he never suffered beforehand from the apprehension of any; it seemed as if he could not think so ill of any two persons' understanding as to suppose they meant to marry till it were proved against them. She blessed the favouring blindness. He could now, without the drawback of a single unpleasant surmise, without a glance forward at any possible treachery in his guest, give way to all his natural kind-hearted civility in solicitous inquiries after Mr. Frank Churchill's accommodation on his journey, through the sad evils of sleeping two nights on the road, and express very genuine unmixed anxiety to know that he had certainly escaped catching cold-which, however, he could not allow him to feel quite assured of himself till after another night.</div>
