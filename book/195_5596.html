<div class="line_en">The autumn passed into winter. Philip had left his address with Mrs. Foster, his uncle's housekeeper, so that she might communicate with him, but still went once a week to the hospital on the chance of there being a letter. One evening he saw his name on an envelope in a handwriting he had hoped never to see again. It gave him a queer feeling. For a little while he could not bring himself to take it. It brought back a host of hateful memories. But at length, impatient with himself, he ripped open the envelope.</div>

<div class="line_en">A feeling of disgust surged up in him at the thought of seeing her again. He did not care if she was in distress, it served her right whatever it was, he thought of her with hatred, and the love he had had for her aroused his loathing. His recollections filled him with nausea, and as he walked across the Thames he drew himself aside in an instinctive withdrawal from his thought of her. He went to bed, but he could not sleep; he wondered what was the matter with her, and he could not get out of his head the fear that she was ill and hungry; she would not have written to him unless she were desperate. He was angry with himself for his weakness, but he knew that he would have no peace unless he saw her. Next morning he wrote a letter-card and posted it on his way to the shop. He made it as stiff as he could and said merely that he was sorry she was in difficulties and would come to the address she had given at seven o'clock that evening.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was that of a shabby lodging-house in a sordid street; and when, sick at the thought of seeing her, he asked whether she was in, a wild hope seized him that she had left. It looked the sort of place people moved in and out of frequently. He had not thought of looking at the postmark on her letter and did not know how many days it had lain in the rack. The woman who answered the bell did not reply to his inquiry, but silently preceded him along the passage and knocked on a door at the back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="菲利普来到一条肮脏的巷子，看到一家破破烂烂的小旅馆。他不想见到米尔德里德，甚至敲门询问的时候还暗自希望她已经离开了。这个地方看上去像是经常有人搬进搬出。昨天看信的时候也忘了瞧一眼信封上的时间，不知道它在医院的架子上待了几天。赶来开门的女人没有搭理他的问题，只静静带他进了屋子，穿过走廊，敲了敲尽头的一扇房门。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He walked in and she closed the door. It was a very small bed-room, untidy as was every place she lived in; there was a pair of shoes on the floor, lying apart from one another and uncleaned; a hat was on the chest of drawers, with false curls beside it; and there was a blouse on the table. Philip looked for somewhere to put his hat. The hooks behind the door were laden with skirts, and he noticed that they were muddy at the hem.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="菲利普走进屋，她在身后关上屋门。这是间小小的卧室，和她之前住过的地方一样满眼脏乱。地上扔着一双鞋，脏兮兮的，东一只西一只。帽子搁在橱柜上，旁边是一顶卷卷的假发，桌子上还放了一件罩衫。菲利普想找个地方放帽子，可门后的挂钩挂着好几件裙子，裙摆上全是泥点子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He did not say anything. He waited for her to explain why she wanted to see him. The look of the room told him clearly enough that she had gone back to the life from which he had taken her. He wondered what had happened to the baby; there was a photograph of it on the chimney-piece, but no sign in the room that a child was ever there. Mildred was holding her handkerchief. She made it into a little ball, and passed it from hand to hand. He saw that she was very nervous. She was staring at the fire, and he could look at her without meeting her eyes. She was much thinner than when she had left him; and the skin, yellow and dryish, was drawn more tightly over her cheekbones. She had dyed her hair and it was now flaxen: it altered her a good deal, and made her look more vulgar.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="菲利普沉默了。他倒想听听看，米尔德里德到底为什么要见自己。当年他救她于水深火热之中，可现在这间卧室的邋遢样子已经说明她的日子又回到了那阵黑暗的时候。他想知道孩子现在过得如何。壁炉架上有张她的照片，但是屋里似乎没有小孩的玩具衣物。米尔德里德掏出手帕，揉成一个小球，在两只手里倒来倒去。菲利普能看出她好像非常紧张。她盯着炉子里的火看了半天，菲利普仔细打量着她，她也一直没有回头。她比上次见面时消瘦很多，皮肤干黄粗糙，紧绷绷地附在突起的颧骨上。头发染成亚麻色，整体看起来和以前很不相同，更加俗气。">查看中文翻译</div>

They sat opposite one another, as they had so often sat before; he wondered if she remembered; they had nothing to say to one another and would have sat in silence if Philip had not forced himself to talk.

<div class="line_en">When they had finished eating they called at the chemist's for the medicine Philip had ordered, and going back to the shabby room he made her take a dose. Then they sat together till it was time for Philip to go back to Harrington Street. He was hideously bored.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们吃完饭去药房拿了菲利普给她开的药。回到那间破破烂烂的小屋后，菲利普盯着她吃了一剂。他们又坐了一会儿，直到菲利普起身回哈灵顿街。他在这房子里待得烦躁透了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Philip went to see her every day. She took the medicine he had prescribed and followed his directions, and soon the results were so apparent that she gained the greatest confidence in Philip's skill. As she grew better she grew less despondent. She talked more freely.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="之后，他每天都来看望她。她按他的方子拿药，按时服用，病情很快见好。她对菲利普的医术很满意，心情一点点晴朗起来，话也开始变多了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Each time he saw her, Philip asked whether she had found work. She told him not to worry, she would find something to do as soon as she wanted it; she had several strings to her bow; it was all the better not to do anything for a week or two. He could not deny this, but at the end of that time he became more insistent. She laughed at him, she was much more cheerful now, and said he was a fussy old thing. She told him long stories of the manageresses she interviewed, for her idea was to get work at some eating-house; what they said and what she answered. Nothing definite was fixed, but she was sure to settle something at the beginning of the following week: there was no use hurrying, and it would be a mistake to take something unsuitable.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="菲利普每次见面时都要问问她找到工作了没有。她让菲利普别着急，等自己想找了，肯定立刻就能找到。她还留了好几手呢，现在休息一两周反倒更好。这话倒是没错，可两个礼拜转眼就结束了，菲利普变得越来越着急，而她却越来越高兴，还嘲笑他像个大惊小怪的老头儿。她想在餐馆找个活儿干，跟他长篇大论地讲着面试时遇到的几个女经理，以及她们问了些什么，她又答了些什么。人家还没给准信，她就拍着胸脯说等到下周事情一定能有眉目，着急也没用，那些不合适自己的工作，宁可不要做。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It's absurd to talk like that," he said impatiently. "You must take anything you can get. I can't help you, and your money won't last for ever."</div>

<div class="line_en">He looked at her sharply. It was three weeks since his first visit, and she had then less than seven pounds. Suspicion seized him. He remembered some of the things she had said. He put two and two together. He wondered whether she had made any attempt to find work. Perhaps she had been lying to him all the time. It was very strange that her money should have lasted so long.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="菲利普忽然想到什么似的，飞快地向她扫了一眼。已经过去三周了，她一开始身上只有不到七镑。菲利普觉得这事很蹊跷，想到她之前说的话，顺着推理了一番。他不确定她是否真有找工作的意思，也许她一直在撒谎。那点儿钱竟然到现在还没花完，真是太让人生疑了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, the landlady's very nice, different from what some of them are; she's quite willing to wait till it's convenient for me to pay."</div>

<div class="line_en">He was silent. What he suspected was so horrible that he hesitated. It was no use to ask her, she would deny everything; if he wanted to know he must find out for himself. He was in the habit of leaving her every evening at eight, and when the clock struck he got up; but instead of going back to Harrington Street he stationed himself at the corner of Fitzroy Square so that he could see anyone who came along William Street. It seemed to him that he waited an interminable time, and he was on the point of going away, thinking his surmise had been mistaken, when the door of No. 7 opened and Mildred came out. He fell back into the darkness and watched her walk towards him. She had on the hat with a quantity of feathers on it which he had seen in her room, and she wore a dress he recognized, too showy for the street and unsuitable to the time of year. He followed her slowly till she came into the Tottenham Court Road, where she slackened her pace; at the corner of Oxford Street she stopped, looked round, and crossed over to a music-hall. He went up to her and touched her on the arm. He saw that she had rouged her cheeks and painted her lips.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="菲利普沉默了。他越想越怕，不敢把自己怀疑的事拿出来问她。况且问了也没用，她一定会百般抵赖。要想得知真相，只能靠他亲自找到。他习惯每晚八点从她家离开，等钟声一响就起身出门。可他没回哈灵顿街，而是偷偷躲在菲茨罗伊广场一角，盯着所有从威廉街经过的人。他觉得自己已经等了好久，心想可能是自己搞错了，可正准备放弃时，七号房的大门忽然打开，米尔德里德从里面走了出来。他又躲进黑暗里，看着她朝自己的方向走来。菲利普认出她戴的帽子正是房间里插满羽毛的那一顶。那身不合季节、华丽浮夸的裙子，让她走在街上显得格格不入。他跟着她慢慢走到托特纳姆法院路，她忽然放慢步子，停在牛津街的拐角处，四下看了看，穿过街道往杂耍剧院走去。他跑了几步，过去碰了碰她的胳膊。她转过身来，绛红色的胭脂搽了厚厚一层，嘴唇也涂上了口红。">查看中文翻译</div>
