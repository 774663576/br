<div class="line_en">The ship was small, his cabin smaller, but the captain would not allow him abovedecks. The rocking of the deck beneath his feet made his stomach heave, and the wretched food tasted even worse when retched back up. But why did he need salt beef, hard cheese, and bread crawling with worms when he had wine to nourish him? It was red and sour, very strong. Sometimes he heaved the wine up too, but there was always more.</div>

<div class="line_en">"The world is full of wine," he muttered in the dankness of his cabin. His father never had any use for drunkards, but what did that matter? His father was dead. He'd killed him. A bolt in the belly, my lord, and all for you. If only I was better with a crossbow, I would have put it through that cock you made me with, you bloody bastard.</div>

<div class="line_en">Belowdecks, there was neither night nor day. Tyrion marked time by the comings and goings of the cabin boy who brought the meals he did not eat. The boy always brought a brush and bucket too, to clean up. "Is this Dornish wine?" Tyrion asked him once, as he pulled a stopper from a skin. "It reminds me of a certain snake I knew. A droll fellow, till a mountain fell on him."</div>

<div class="line_en">Oberyn was dead, though, his head smashed to bloody ruin by the armored fist of Ser Gregor Clegane. And without the Red Viper to urge him on, would Doran Martell even consider such a chancy scheme? He might clap me in chains instead and hand me back to my sweet sister. The Wall might be safer. Old Bear Mormont said the Night's Watch had need of men like Tyrion. Mormont might be dead, though. By now Slynt may be the lord commander. That butcher's son was not like to have forgotten who sent him to the Wall. Do I really want to spend the rest of my life eating salt beef and porridge with murderers and thieves? Not that the rest of his life would last very long. Janos Slynt would see to that.</div>

<div class="line_en">The cabin boy did not answer. He was an ugly boy, though admittedly more comely than a certain dwarf with half a nose and a scar from eye to chin. "Have I offended you?" Tyrion asked, as the boy was scrubbing. "Were you commanded not to talk to me? Or did some dwarf diddle your mother?" That went unanswered too. "Where are we sailing? Tell me that." Jaime had made mention of the Free Cities, but had never said which one. "Is it Braavos? Tyrosh? Myr?" Tyrion would sooner have gone to Dorne. Myrcella is older than Tommen, by Dornish law the Iron Throne is hers. I will help her claim her rights, as Prince Oberyn suggested.</div>

<div class="line_en">The wine has blurred my wits. He had learned to read High Valyrian at his maester's knee, though what they spoke in the Nine Free Cities… well, it was not so much a dialect as nine dialects on the way to becoming separate tongues. Tyrion had some Braavosi and a smattering of Myrish. In Tyrosh he should be able to curse the gods, call a man a cheat, and order up an ale, thanks to a sellsword he had once known at the Rock. At least in Dorne they speak the Common Tongue. Like Dornish food and Dornish law, Dornish speech was spiced with the flavors of the Rhoyne, but a man could comprehend it. Dorne, yes, Dorne for me. He crawled into his bunk, clutching that thought like a child with a doll.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="是酒搞混了我的脑子。他曾在他家学士的膝上学习过高等瓦雷利亚的阅读，虽然在九个自由城邦里所讲的…嗯，那不能算是一种方言，因为九种方言语调完全不同了。提利昂会说一点布拉佛斯语，密尔语也可以糊弄一下。他可以用泰洛西语诅咒老天，骂人是骗子，还能点上杯麦酒，这都要归功于在凯岩城结识的那位佣兵。至少在多恩他们会讲通用语。就和多恩的食物和法律一样，多恩语里掺杂了洛恩人的味道，不过还能听得懂。多恩，是啊，多恩才是我该去的地方。他爬进他的铺位，紧抓住这个念头不放，像个小孩拽着洋娃娃。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The cabin boy wet his brush and scrubbed on manfully. "Have you ever visited the pleasure houses of Lys?" the dwarf inquired. "Might that be where whores go?" Tyrion could not seem to recall the Valyrian word for whore, and in any case it was too late. The boy tossed his brush back in his bucket and took his leave.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="侍童沾湿了刷子，用力地擦洗着。“你去过里斯的风月场所吗？”这侏儒问道。“那地方可能就是妓女的去处？”提利昂似乎已记不起瓦雷利亚语里的妓女一词，而且也太迟了。那男孩已将刷子扔回木桶离开了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sleep had never come easily to Tyrion Lannister. Aboard that ship it seldom came at all, though from time to time he managed to drink sufficient wine to pass out for a while. At least he did not dream. He had dreamed enough for one small life. And of such follies: love, justice, friendship, glory. As well dream of being tall. It was all beyond his reach, Tyrion knew now. But he did not know where whores go.</div>

That was when the dwarf turned to the eunuch and said, "I've killed my father," in the same tone a man might use to say, "I've stubbed my toe."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Wherever whores go," his father had said. His last words, and what words they were. The crossbow thrummed, Lord Tywin sat back down, and Tyrion Lannister found himself waddling through the darkness with Varys at his side. He must have clambered back down the shaft, two hundred and thirty rungs to where orange embers glowed in the mouth of an iron dragon. He remembered none of it. Only the sound the crossbow made, and the stink of his father's bowels opening. Even in his dying, he found a way to shit on me.</div>

<div class="line_en">He found a fresh skin of wine instead and sucked at it as if it were a woman's breast. The sour red ran down his chin and soaked through his soiled tunic, the same one he had been wearing in his cell. The deck was swaying beneath his feet, and when he tried to rise it lifted sideways and smashed him hard against a bulkhead. A storm, he realized, or else I am even drunker than I knew. He retched the wine up and lay in it a while, wondering if the ship would sink. Is this your vengeance, Father? Has the Father Above made you his Hand? "Such are the wages of the kinslayer," he said as the wind howled outside. It did not seem fair to drown the cabin boy and the captain and all the rest for something he had done, but when had the gods ever been fair? And around about then, the darkness gulped him down.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他找到了一个尚未开塞的酒袋，贪婪地嘬吸着，仿佛那是妇人的乳房。酸酸的红酒顺着下巴流下，浸湿了他入狱以来就一直穿着的脏兮兮的外套。脚下的舱板剧烈摇晃着；他试图起身，但舱板一个侧倾，把他抛倒在另一边床头。风暴，他想到，要么就是我醉得比自己知道的还要厉害。酒吐了一身，他却躺着没动，疑惑着船是不是快要沉了。这是你的报复吗，父亲？天父封你做他的首相了？“这就是弑亲者的报应”，他说道，风在舱外嘶吼着。因为他的所作所为就要那侍童、船长和其他人一起陪葬似乎不太公平，可是神明们什么时候公平过呢？随即而来的黑暗吞噬了他。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When he stirred again, his head felt like to burst and the ship was spinning round in dizzy circles, though the captain was insisting that they'd come to port. Tyrion told him to be quiet and kicked feebly as a huge bald sailor tucked him under one arm and carried him squirming to the hold, where an empty wine cask awaited him. It was a squat little cask, and a tight fit even for a dwarf. Tyrion pissed himself in his struggles, for all the good it did. He was crammed face-first into the cask with his knees pushed up against his ears. The stub of his nose itched horribly, but his arms were pinned so tightly that he could not reach to scratch it. A palanquin fit for a man of my stature, he thought as they hammered shut the lid. He could hear voices shouting as he was hoisted up. Every bounce cracked his head against the bottom of the cask. The world went round and round as the cask rolled downward, then stopped with a crash that made him want to scream. Another cask slammed into his, and Tyrion bit his tongue.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="等到他再能动弹时，头好像裂开了一样。船仍在令人眩晕地打着转，尽管船长坚称他们已经靠岸了。提利昂叫他安静下来，这时一个高大的光头水手将他劈手夹在腋下，往货舱走去。提利昂在他腋下扭动着，无力地踢了踢腿。在货舱里等着他的是一个空酒桶。这是一个短粗的小桶，即便对侏儒来说也够挤得。更糟的是，提利昂在挣扎中尿湿了裤子。他被脸朝下塞进了酒桶，双膝挤到了耳边。残留的鼻头奇痒难忍，但双手卡得紧紧，想挠也够不着。一顶对我来说合身的轿子，在那些人钉上桶盖时他想到了这个。当桶吊起来时，他能听到外面的喧嚣。每次撞击，他的头都会磕在桶底。酒桶朝下滚去，这世界也不停旋转。一阵突来的剧震让酒桶停了下来，也让他直想尖叫。又一个酒桶重重砸了上来，这一次提利昂咬伤了舌头。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It ended as it had begun, with another roll that left him dizzy and more jouncing. Outside, strange voices were speaking in a tongue he did not know. Someone started pounding on the top of the cask and the lid cracked open suddenly. Light came flooding in, and cool air as well. Tyrion gasped greedily and tried to stand, but only managed to knock the cask over sideways and spill himself out onto a hard-packed earthen floor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="旅途的结束和开始一样，也是伴随着一圈令他眩晕的滚动和一阵颠簸。外面，一个陌生的声音在用某种他听不懂的语言交谈着。有人开始敲击木桶顶部。盖子突然间打开了。光线涌了进来，还有清凉的空气。提利昂贪婪地大口吸着，试图想直起身来，却只是撞翻了木桶，随后滚到了硬邦邦的泥地上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Above him loomed a grotesque fat man with a forked yellow beard, holding a wooden mallet and an iron chisel. His bedrobe was large enough to serve as a tourney pavilion, but its loosely knotted belt had come undone, exposing a huge white belly and a pair of heavy breasts that sagged like sacks of suet covered with coarse yellow hair. He reminded Tyrion of a dead sea cow that had once washed up in the caverns under Casterly Rock.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一个怪异的肥胖男子出现在他身形上方，留着黄色的八字胡，手握木槌和铁凿。他身上的袍子如此宽大，足以做顶比武大会上的帐篷。不过那原本就疏松的腰带散了开来，露出一个肥白的肚子和一对沉重的胸脯，双胸下垂得厉害，倒好像是覆着黄色粗毛的两袋油脂。他让提利昂想起了一头被冲进凯岩城海边洞窟中的死海牛。">查看中文翻译</div>

His stunted legs began to cramp, and soon hurt so badly that he forgot the hammering in his head.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽然只持续了半个钟头，但这却是他毕生经历的最漫长的旅途。他被举起，放下，滚滚停停，颠来倒去，又接着滚。透过桶壁他听到外面人声鼎沸，有次还传来不远处马的嘶鸣。他发育不全的双腿开始抽筋，很快这剧痛就让他忘了脑中的轰鸣。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"A rotting sea cow." Tyrion's mouth was full of blood. He spat it at the fat man's feet. They were in a long, dim cellar with barrel-vaulted ceilings, its stone walls spotted with nitre. Casks of wine and ale surrounded them, more than enough drink to see a thirsty dwarf safely through the night. Or through a life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“一头腐烂的海牛。”提利昂满嘴是血，一口唾在了胖子的脚边。他们在一个幽深的酒窖里，拱形的屋顶，石墙上布着硝石斑。环绕他们的是一桶桶的葡萄酒和麦芽酒，足够让一个嗜酒的侏儒安然渡过今晚——或者渡过此生。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Across the pool stood a brick wall twelve feet high, with iron spikes along its top. Beyond that was the city. A sea of tiled rooftops crowded close around a bay. He saw square brick towers, a great red temple, a distant manse upon a hill. In the far distance, sunlight shimmered off deep water. Fishing boats were moving across the bay, their sails rippling in the wind, and he could see the masts of larger ships poking up along the shore. Surely one is bound for Dorne, or for Eastwatch-by-the-Sea. He had no means to pay for passage, though, nor was he made to pull an oar. I suppose I could sign on as a cabin boy and earn my way by letting the crew bugger me up and down the narrow sea.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="池塘那边耸立着十二尺高的砖墙，墙头装着一排铁刺。墙外便是这座城市了。一片紧挨着的平顶屋构成的海洋围着一个港湾。他看见了一些方方的砖塔，一座红色的大神庙，还有远处山上的一所牧师大院。更远处，阳光在深海的海面上跃动。渔船正穿过港湾，白帆在风中招展。他甚至能看到靠岸的大船上那直立的桅杆。肯定有一艘是去多恩的，或者是去东海望。不过他付不了船钱，也不是划桨的料子。也许我可以找份侍童的活，把我自己卖给那些船上的基佬来挣出这笔钱。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Beneath his window six cherry trees stood sentinel around a marble pool, their slender branches bare and brown. A naked boy stood on the water, poised to duel with a bravo's blade in hand. He was lithe and handsome, no older than sixteen, with straight blond hair that brushed his shoulders.

It reminded him of how Tysha would riffle his hair during the false spring of their marriage, before he helped his father's guardsmen rape her. He had been thinking of those guardsmen during his flight, trying to recall how many there had been. You would think he might remember that, but no. A dozen? A score? A hundred? He could not say. They had all been grown men, tall and strong… though all men were tall to a dwarf of thirteen years. Tysha knew their number.

The clothes had been made for a small boy, he realized as he struggled into them. The fabrics were rich enough, if a little musty, but the cut was too long in the legs and too short in the arms, with a collar that would have turned his face as black as Joffrey's had he somehow contrived to get it fastened.

Both were near as fat as Illyrio, with teats that were larger than his head. I could smother myself in flesh. There were worse ways to die. The way his lord father had died, for one. I should have made him shit a little gold before expiring. Lord Tywin might have been niggardly with his approval and affection, but he had always been open-handed when it came to coin.

<div class="line_en">As it happened, he left by the wrong door and never found the pool he had spied from his window, but it made no matter. The gardens behind the manse were just as pleasant, and far more extensive. He wandered through them for a time, drinking. The walls would have shamed any proper castle, and the ornamental iron spikes along the top looked strangely naked without heads to adorn them. Tyrion pictured how his sister's head might look up there, with tar in her golden hair and flies buzzing in and out of her mouth. Yes, and Jaime must have the spike beside her, he decided. No one must ever come between my brother and my sister.</div>

<div class="line_en">Tyrion left the fat women to their loaves and kettles and went in search of the cellar where Illyrio had decanted him the night before. It was not hard to find. There was enough wine there to keep him drunk for a hundred years; sweet reds from the Reach and sour reds from Dorne, pale Pentoshi ambers, the green nectar of Myr, three score casks of Arbor gold, even wines from the fabled east, from Qarth and Yi Ti and Asshai by the Shadow. In the end, Tyrion chose a cask of strongwine marked as the private stock of Lord Runceford Redwyne, the grandfather of the present Lord of the Arbor. The taste of it was languorous and heady on the tongue, the color a purple so dark that it looked almost black in the dim-lit cellar. Tyrion filled a cup, and a flagon for good measure, and carried them up to the gardens to drink beneath those cherry trees he'd seen.</div>

<div class="line_en">He saw three gates during his wanderings -- the main entrance with its gatehouse, a postern by the kennels, and a garden gate hidden behind a tangle of pale ivy. The last was chained, the others guarded. The guards were plump, their faces as smooth as babies' bottoms, and every man of them wore a spiked bronze cap. Tyrion knew eunuchs when he saw them. He knew their sort by reputation. They feared nothing and felt no pain, it was said, and were loyal to their masters unto death. I could make good use of a few hundred of mine own, he reflected.

"I have no cup for you, we'll have to share." The wash-erwoman went back to wringing out tunics and hanging them to dry. Tyrion settled on a stone bench with his flagon. "Tell me, how far should I trust Magister Illyrio?" The name made her look up. "That far?" Chuckling, he crossed his stunted legs and took a drink. "I am loath to play whatever part the cheesemonger has in mind for me, yet how can I refuse him? The gates are guarded. Perhaps you might smuggle me out under your skirts? I'd be so grateful; why, I'll even wed you. I have two wives already, why not three? Ah, but where would we live?" He gave her as pleasant a smile as a man with half a nose could manage. "I have a niece in Sunspear, did I tell you? I could make rather a lot of mischief in Dorne with Myrcella. I could set my niece and nephew at war, wouldn't that be droll?" The washerwoman pinned up one of Illyrio's tunics, large enough to double as a sail. "I should be ashamed to think such evil thoughts, you're quite right. Better if I sought the Wall instead. All crimes are wiped clean when a man joins the Night's Watch, they say. Though I fear they would not let me keep you, sweetling. No women in the Watch, no sweet freckly wives to warm your bed at night, only cold winds, salted cod, and small beer. Do you think I might stand taller in black, my lady?" He filled his cup again. "What do you say? North or south? Shall I atone for old sins or make some new ones?"</div>

Perhaps I should stumble back down to the cellars. The strongwine was making his head spin, though, and the cellar steps were very steep. "Where do whores go?" he asked the wash flapping on the line. Perhaps he should have asked the washerwoman. Not to imply that you're a whore, my dear, but perhaps you know where they go. Or better yet, he should have asked his father.

<div class="line_en">"What one king does, another may undo. In Pentos we have a prince, my friend. He presides at ball and feast and rides about the city in a palanquin of ivory and gold. Three heralds go before him with the golden scales of trade, the iron sword of war, and the silver scourge of justice. On the first day of each new year he must deflower the maid of the fields and the maid of the seas." Illyrio leaned forward, elbows on the table. "Yet should a crop fail or a war be lost, we cut his throat to appease the gods and choose a new prince from amongst the forty families."</div>
