<div class="line_en">Noirtier replied only with a look that turned Villefort's blood to ice. Then the same eyes asked Valentine to come over to him. In a moment, thanks to the means which she usually employed in her conversations with her grandfather, she had found the word "key". Then she looked at the invalid, who was staring hard at the drawer in a little table between the two windows. She opened the drawer and did indeed find a key inside it. Once she had the key and the old man had shown her that it was the right one, his eyes turned towards an old, long-forgotten writing-desk which everyone assumed to be full of useless papers.</div>

<div class="line_en">When Franz had finished this account, so terrible for a son to read; when Valentine, pale and tense, had wiped away a tear; and when Villefort, trembling in a corner, had tried to avert the storm with a look of entreaty towards the pitiless old man, d'Epinay turned to Noirtier and said: "Monsieur, since you know every detail of this frightful story, since you have had it witnessed by honourable men, and finally since you seem to take an interest in me, even though so far your interest has only been a source of pain, do not deny me one last satisfaction: tell me the name of the president of the club, so that I may at last know who killed my poor father."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="弗兰士读完这一卷可怕的文件，凡兰蒂感动得脸色发白，抹掉一滴眼泪，维尔福浑身发抖，畏缩在一个角落里，以哀恳的眼光投向那个铁石心肠的老人。“阁下，”伊辟楠对诺梯埃说，“这卷文件上的证人都是很有名望的人士，既然您对于这些情形知道得这样详细，既然您似乎很关切我——虽然截至目前为止，您所给我的只是悲痛——请不要拒绝给我最后的满足，告诉我那个俱乐部的主席叫什么名字，我至少也可以知道杀死我那可怜的父亲的究竟是谁。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Villefort, as though distracted, was groping for the handle of the door. Valentine shrank back a pace: she had guessed the old man's reply before anyone, having often noticed the scars of two sword-wounds on his forearm.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Alas, no!" said Franz. "The one hope that sustained me throughout the account and gave me the strength to read it to the end, was that I should at least learn the name of the man who killed my father. Monsieur!" he cried, turning to Noirtier, "In heaven's name, do what you can… I beg you, try to show me, to let me know…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“噢，痛苦呀！”弗兰士喊道，“我所以还能有勇气读到底，就是希望至少可以知道杀死我父亲的那个人的名字！阁下！阁下！”他转向诺梯埃喊道，“看老天面上，想想办法！想一个办法来使我知道吧！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Come, Monsieur," said Villefort. "Take my advice, do not prolong this frightful scene. In any case, the names were concealed deliberately.

<div class="line_cn" title="“算了吧，阁下！”维尔福说，“这幕可怕的场面别再延长下去了。那个名字是故意隐讳掉的。家父自己也不知道这个主席究竟是谁，即使知道，他也无法告诉您，字典里是没有专用名词的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
