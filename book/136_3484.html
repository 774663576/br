<div class="line_en">It was Mrs Parsons, the wife of a neighbour on the same floor. ("Mrs" was a word somewhat discountenanced by the Party -- you were supposed to call everyone "comrade" -- but with some women one used it instinctively.) She was a woman of about thirty, but looking much older. One had the impression that there was dust in the creases of her face. Winston followed her down the passage. These amateur repair jobs were an almost daily irritation. Victory Mansions were old flats, built in 1930 or thereabouts, and were falling to pieces. The plaster flaked constantly from ceilings and walls, the pipes burst in every hard frost, the roof leaked whenever there was snow, the heating system was usually running at half steam when it was not closed down altogether from motives of economy. Repairs, except what you could do for yourself, had to be sanctioned by remote committees which were liable to hold up even the mending of a window-pane for two years.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Parsons' flat was bigger than Winston's, and dingy in a different way. Everything had a battered, trampled-on look, as though the place had just been visited by some large violent animal. Games impedimenta -- hockey-sticks, boxing-gloves, a burst football, a pair of sweaty shorts turned inside out -- lay all over the floor, and on the table there was a litter of dirty dishes and dog-eared exercise-books. On the walls were scarlet banners of the Youth League and the Spies, and a full-sized poster of Big Brother. There was the usual boiled-cabbage smell, common to the whole building, but it was shot through by a sharper reek of sweat, which -- one knew this at the first sniff, though it was hard to say how -- was the sweat of some person not present at the moment. In another room someone with a comb and a piece of toilet paper was trying to keep tune with the military music which was still issuing from the telescreen.</div>

<div class="line_en">Parsons was Winston's fellow-employee at the Ministry of Truth. He was a fattish but active man of paralysing stupidity, a mass of imbecile enthusiasms -- one of those completely unquestioning, devoted drudges on whom, more even than on the Thought Police, the stability of the Party depended. At thirty-five he had just been unwillingly evicted from the Youth League, and before graduating into the Youth League he had managed to stay on in the Spies for a year beyond the statutory age. At the Ministry he was employed in some subordinate post for which intelligence was not required, but on the other hand he was a leading figure on the Sports Committee and all the other committees engaged in organizing community hikes, spontaneous demonstrations, savings campaigns, and voluntary activities generally. He would inform you with quiet pride, between whiffs of his pipe, that he had put in an appearance at the Community Centre every evening for the past four years. An overpowering smell of sweat, a sort of unconscious testimony to the strenuousness of his life, followed him about wherever he went, and even remained behind him after he had gone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="帕森斯是温斯顿在真理部的同事。他是一个胖子，人很活跃，但愚不可及，是个满腔热忱的傻瓜——就是绝对忠诚、任劳任怨的那种人，党对他们的信赖甚至超过了思想警察。到了三十五岁，他才不情不愿地从青年团退出，在加入青年团之前，他还设法在少年侦察队超龄多待了一年。在真理部，他被派在一个不需要什么智力的次要岗位上工作，但另一方面，他是体育委员会及其他一些委员会的重要人物，参与组织集体远足、自发游行、节能运动和一般的志愿活动。他会一边抽着烟，一边告诉你，过去的四年，他每个晚上都参加社区中心的活动。无论他去哪儿，跟着他的是一股强烈的汗臭，甚至他走了，汗臭味仍留着，这成了他紧张生活的天然证明。">查看中文翻译</div>

Winston knelt down and examined the angle-joint of the pipe. He hated using his hands, and he hated bending down, which was always liable to start him coughing. Mrs Parsons looked on helplessly.</div>

He cleaned his fingers as best he could in the cold water from the tap and went back into the other room.</div>

<div class="line_en">A handsome, tough-looking boy of nine had popped up from behind the table and was menacing him with a toy automatic pistol, while his small sister, about two years younger, made the same gesture with a fragment of wood. Both of them were dressed in the blue shorts, grey shirts, and red neckerchiefs which were the uniform of the Spies. Winston raised his hands above his head, but with an uneasy feeling, so vicious was the boy's demeanour, that it was not altogether a game.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一个长得好看、脸色严峻的九岁男孩从桌子后面跳出来，用一把玩具自动手枪指着他，而他的两岁左右的小妹妹拿一块木片做着同样的姿势。他们两个都穿着蓝短裤、灰衬衫，系着红领巾，这是少年侦察队的制服。温斯顿将手举过头顶，但心里感到不安，孩子们的举动如此充满敌意，这根本不像一种游戏。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Some Eurasian prisoners, guilty of war crimes, were to be hanged in the Park that evening, Winston remembered. This happened about once a month, and was a popular spectacle. Children always clamoured to be taken to see it. He took his leave of Mrs Parsons and made for the door. But he had not gone six steps down the passage when something hit the back of his neck an agonizingly painful blow. It was as though a red-hot wire had been jabbed into him. He spun round just in time to see Mrs Parsons dragging her son back into the doorway while the boy pocketed a catapult.</div>

<div class="line_en">With those children, he thought, that wretched woman must lead a life of terror. Another year, two years, and they would be watching her night and day for symptoms of unorthodoxy. Nearly all children nowadays were horrible. What was worst of all was that by means of such organizations as the Spies they were systematically turned into ungovernable little savages, and yet this produced in them no tendency whatever to rebel against the discipline of the Party. On the contrary, they adored the Party and everything connected with it. The songs, the processions, the banners, the hiking, the drilling with dummy rifles, the yelling of slogans, the worship of Big Brother -- it was all a sort of glorious game to them. All their ferocity was turned outwards, against the enemies of the State, against foreigners, traitors, saboteurs, thought-criminals. It was almost normal for people over thirty to be frightened of their own children. And with good reason, for hardly a week passed in which "The Times" did not carry a paragraph describing how some eavesdropping little sneak -- "child hero" was the phrase generally used -- had overheard some compromising remark and denounced its parents to the Thought Police.</div>

Nor did it even seem to matter greatly. There was a link of understanding between them, more important than affection or partisanship.

He had walked on without pausing. What was curious was that at the time, in the dream, the words had not made much impression on him. It was only later and by degrees that they had seemed to take on significance. He could not now remember whether it was before or after having the dream that he had seen O'Brien for the first time, nor could he remember when he had first identified the voice as O'Brien's. But at any rate the identification existed. It was O'Brien who had spoken to him out of the dark.</div>

<div class="line_en">He took a twenty-five cent piece out of his pocket. There, too, in tiny clear lettering, the same slogans were inscribed, and on the other face of the coin the head of Big Brother. Even from the coin the eyes pursued you. On coins, on stamps, on the covers of books, on banners, on posters, and on the wrappings of a cigarette packet -- everywhere. Always the eyes watching you and the voice enveloping you. Asleep or awake, working or eating, indoors or out of doors, in the bath or in bed -- no escape. Nothing was your own except the few cubic centimetres inside your skull.</div>

<div class="line_en">The sun had shifted round, and the myriad windows of the Ministry of Truth, with the light no longer shining on them, looked grim as the loopholes of a fortress. His heart quailed before the enormous pyramidal shape. It was too strong, it could not be stormed. A thousand rocket bombs would not batter it down. He wondered again for whom he was writing the diary. For the future, for the past -- for an age that might be imaginary. And in front of him there lay not death but annihilation. The diary would be reduced to ashes and himself to vapour. Only the Thought Police would read what he had written, before they wiped it out of existence and out of memory. How could you make appeal to the future when not a trace of you, not even an anonymous word scribbled on a piece of paper, could physically survive?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="太阳西移，真理部无数的窗户不再有阳光照耀，看上去就像堡垒的枪眼一样黑洞洞的。面对这座庞大的金字塔形建筑物，他不免胆怯。它太强大了，不可能被攻占。一千颗火箭弹也炸不倒它。他再次想到他要为谁写这部日记。为将来，为过去——为一个可以想象的时代。他不仅面临死亡，而且是彻底地湮灭。这部日记可能化为灰烬，他自己则蒸发了。只有思想警察会读到他写下的文字，随后抹去它的存在，从记忆中删除。你如何向未来呼吁，如果你连一丝痕迹，甚至在一张纸上草草写下一个无名氏的字都不能幸存？">查看中文翻译</div>

But so long as he uttered it, in some obscure way the continuity was not broken. It was not by making yourself heard but by staying sane that you carried on the human heritage. He went back to the table, dipped his pen, and wrote:</div>

<div class="line_en">Now he had recognized himself as a dead man it became important to stay alive as long as possible. Two fingers of his right hand were inkstained. It was exactly the kind of detail that might betray you. Some nosing zealot in the Ministry (a woman, probably: someone like the little sandy-haired woman or the dark-haired girl from the Fiction Department) might start wondering why he had been writing during the lunch interval, why he had used an old-fashioned pen, WHAT he had been writing -- and then drop a hint in the appropriate quarter. He went to the bathroom and carefully scrubbed the ink away with the gritty dark-brown soap which rasped your skin like sandpaper and was therefore well adapted for this purpose.</div>

A hair laid across the page-ends was too obvious.
