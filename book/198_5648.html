<div class="line_en">Harry ate breakfast each morning in the Leaky Cauldron, where he liked watching the other guests: funny little witches from the country, up for a day's shopping; venerable-looking wizards arguing over the latest article in Transfiguration Today; wild-looking warlocks; raucous dwarfs; and once, what looked suspiciously like a hag, who ordered a plate of raw liver from behind a thick woollen balaclava.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利每天早晨在破釜酒吧吃早饭，他喜欢在那里观察其他住客：乡下来的有趣的小女巫到这里来是为了一整天进行采购；看上去易受伤害的男巫们就《今日变形术》上的新文章进行争论；野头野脑的巫师、喧闹的侏儒；还有，有一次，一个头戴厚厚的巴拉克拉瓦盔帽、看上去令人怀疑是鬼怪的人要了一碟子生肝。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It took Harry several days to get used to his strange new freedom. Never before had he been able to get up whenever he wanted or eat whatever he fancied. He could even go wherever he pleased, as long as it was in Diagon Alley, and as this long cobbled street was packed with the most fascinating wizarding shops in the world, Harry felt no desire to break his word to Fudge and stray back into the Muggle world.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利过了好几天才习惯了他奇异的新自由。以前他从来不能什么时候想睡就睡，想吃就吃。现在他甚至可以到他想去的任何地方，只要那地方在对角巷里面就行，这条长长的铺满小石子的街道两旁都是世界上最让人着迷的魔法商店。因此，哈利并不想破坏他对福吉许下的诺言，没有偏离正道又到麻瓜的世界里去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After breakfast Harry would go out into the backyard, take out his wand, tap the third brick from the left above the trash bit,, and stand back as the archway into Diagon Alley opened in the wall.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="早饭后，哈利往往到后院去，拿出他的魔杖，敲敲垃圾桶上方从左面数第三块砖头，然后后退一步，看着墙上打开的通向对角巷的拱道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry spent the long sunny days exploring the shops and eating under the brightly colored umbrellas outside cafes, where his fellow diners were showing one another their purchases ("it, s a lunascope, old boy -- no more messing around with moon charts, see?") or else discussing the case of Sirius Black ("personalty, I won't let any of the children out alone until he's back in Azkaban"). Harry didn't have to do his homework under the blankets by flashlight anymore; now he could sit in the bright sunshine outside Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlor, finishing all his essays with occasional help from Florean Fortescue himself, who, apart from knowing a great deal about medieval witch burnings, gave Harry free sundaes every half an hour.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利把长长的夏日花在逛商店和在咖啡店外色彩鲜艳的遮阳伞下吃东西上，与他同时进餐的人在那里彼此展览买到的东西（“这是一架望月镜，伙计——再不用摆弄月亮图表了，明白吗？”）或者讨论小天狼星布莱克案件（“我个人认为，在他回到阿兹卡班以前，任何小孩都不能单独出门。”）。哈利再也不用躲在被单下拿着手电筒做家庭作业了，现在他可以坐在弗洛林冷饮店外面的灿烂阳光下，完成他所有的论文，有时候还能得到弗洛林本人的指导，弗洛林除了在中世纪焚烧女巫方面具有广泛的知识以外，还每隔半小时就免费供给哈利一盒冰淇淋。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Curious to know what the crowd in the shop was staring at, Harry edged his way inside and squeezed in among the excited witches and wizards until he glimpsed a newly erected podium, on which was mounted the most magnificent broom he had ever seen in his life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当时有许多人挤在那里看，哈利很好奇，于是便挤了进去。他挤在兴奋的女巫和男巫中间，直到他看到在一个新树立起来的墩座上，有一把扫帚，那是他平生所见过的漂亮得令人吃惊的扫帚。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Once Harry had refilled his money bag with gold Galleons, silver Sickles, and bronze Knuts from his vault at Gringotts, he had to exercise a lot of self-control not to spend the whole lot at once. He had to keep reminding himself that he had five years to go at Hogwarts, and how it would feel to ask the Dursleys for money for spellbooks, to stop himself from buying a handsome set of solid gold Gobstones (a wizarding game rather like marbles, in which the stones squirt a nasty-smelling liquid into the other player's face when they lose a point). He was sorely tempted, too, by the perfect, moving model of the galaxy in a large glass ball, which would have meant he never had to take another Astronomy lesson. But the thing that tested Harry's resolution most appeared in his favorite shop, Quality Quidditch Supplies, a week after he'd arrived at the Leaky Cauldron.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利一旦把钱袋又放满了金加垄银西可和铜纳特以后，他就需要实行自我控制，以免把钱一下子花光。他必须不断提醒自己：他还要在霍格沃茨过五年，而且，向德思礼家人要钱买魔法书会是什么滋味，这样他才能忍住不买一套漂亮的结结实实的金戈布石（魔法界的一种游戏，有点像弹子戏，在这种游戏中，谁丢了一分，那些小石子儿就会把发臭的液体喷射到他脸上）。有一种大玻璃球，里面是美妙的活动星座模型，有了它，就可以不必再上天文学课了；哈利也很想买。但最使哈利动心的东西在他最喜爱的商店，魁地奇精品专卖店里，这是他到了破釜酒吧一星期以后的事。">查看中文翻译</div>

He had never wanted anything as much in his whole life -- but he had never lost a Quidditch match on his Nim bus Two Thousand, and what was the point in emptying his Gringotts vault for the Firebolt, when he had a very good broom already? Harry didn't ask for the price, but he returned, almost every day after that, just to look at the Firebolt.</div>

<div class="line_en">There were, however, things that Harry needed to buy. He went to the Apothecary to replenish his store of potions ingredients, and as his school robes were now several inches too short in the arm and leg, he visited Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasions and bought new ones. Most important of all, he had to buy his new schoolbooks, which would include those for his two new subjects, Care of Magical Creatures and Divination.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，有些东西是哈利必须买的。他到药店去补充药剂的各种成分，而且，由于他的校服与四肢相比短了好几英寸，他去了摩金夫人长袍专卖店买了几件新袍子。最重要的是，他必须购买新的教科书，这类书包括两门新课程，即保护神奇生物和占卜术。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry got a surprise as he looked in at the bookshop window. Instead of the usual display of gold -- embossed spellbooks the size of paving slabs, there was a large iron cage behind the glass that held about a hundred copies of The Monster Book of Monsters. Torn pages were flying everywhere as the books grappled with each other, locked together in furious wrestling matches and snapping aggressively.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利看了看书店的橱窗，不觉吓了一跳。书店橱窗里通常展示的是有地砖那么大、带金色浮雕的咒语书，现在这类书不见了，取而代之的是一个大铁笼子，里面装着约有一百本《妖怪们的妖怪书》。这些书关在一起，狂怒地进行着角力竞赛，好战成性地猛咬、打斗，破碎的书页到处飞扬。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry pulled his booklist out of his pocket and consulted it for the first time. The Monster Book of Monsters was listed as the required book for Care of Magical Creatures. Now Harry understood why Hagrid had said it would come in useful. He felt relieved; he had been wondering whether Hagrid wanted help with some terrifying new pet.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“请让开一点儿。”经理不耐烦地说，把哈利推向一边。他戴上一副很厚的手套，拿起一根很粗的、满是节疤的手杖，走向那装有《妖怪们的妖怪书》的铁笼子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Probably 'cause it's you, isn't it?" shrugged Ron, still chuckling. "Famous Harry Potter and all that. I'd hate to see what the Ministry'd do to me if I blew up an aunt. Mind you, they'd have to dig me up first, because Mum would've killed me. Anyway, you can ask Dad yourself this evening. We're staying at the Leaky Cauldron tonight too! So you can come to King's Cross with us tomorrow! Hermione's there as well!"</div>
