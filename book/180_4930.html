<div class="line_en">Smiling, for it was an admirable idea, that had flashed upon her this very second -- William and Lily should marry -- she took the heather-mixture stocking, with its criss-cross of steel needles at the mouth of it, and measured it against James's leg.</div>

<div class="line_en">"My dear, stand still," she said, for in his jealousy, not liking to serve as measuring block for the Lighthouse keeper's little boy, James fidgeted purposely; and if he did that, how could she see, was it too long, was it too short? she asked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“亲爱的，站好别动。”她说，因为詹姆斯出于嫉妒，不愿为灯塔看守人的小儿子充当量尺，所以故意动来动去；他要是这样，她又怎么能看得出来袜子是太长了还是太短了？她问道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She looked up -- what demon possessed him, her youngest, her cherished?-- and saw the room, saw the chairs, thought them fearfully shabby. Their entrails, as Andrew said the other day, were all over the floor; but then what was the point, she asked, of buying good chairs to let them spoil up here all through the winter when the house, with only one old woman to see to it, positively dripped with wet? Never mind, the rent was precisely twopence half-penny; the children loved it; it did her husband good to be three thousand, or if she must be accurate, three hundred miles from his libraries and his lectures and his disciples; and there was room for visitors. Mats, camp beds, crazy ghosts of chairs and tables whose London life of service was done -- they did well enough here; and a photograph or two, and books. Books, she thought, grew of themselves. She never had time to read them. Alas! even the books that had been given her and inscribed by the hand of the poet himself: "For her whose wishes must be obeyed"…"The happier Helen of our days"… disgraceful to say, she had never read them. And Croom on the Mind and Bates on the Savage Customs of Polynesia ("My dear, stand still," she said)-- neither of those could one send to the Lighthouse. At a certain moment, she supposed, the house would become so shabby that something must be done. If they could be taught to wipe their feet and not bring the beach in with them -- that would be something. Crabs, she had to allow, if Andrew really wished to dissect them, or if Jasper believed that one could make soup from seaweed, one could not prevent it; or Rose's objects -- shells, reeds, stones; for they were gifted, her children, but all in quite different ways. And the result of it was, she sighed, taking in the whole room from floor to ceiling, as she held the stocking against James's leg, that things got shabbier and got shabbier summer after summer. The mat was fading; the wall-paper was flapping. You couldn't tell any more that those were roses on it. Still, if every door in a house is left perpetually open, and no lockmaker in the whole of Scotland can mend a bolt, things must spoil. Every door was left open. She listened. The drawing-room door was open; the hall door was open; it sounded as if the bedroom doors were open; and certainly the window on the landing was open, for that she had opened herself. That windows should be open, and doors shut -- simple as it was, could none of them remember it? She would go into the maids' bedrooms at night and find them sealed like ovens, except for Marie's, the Swiss girl, who would rather go without a bath than without fresh air, but then at home, she had said, "the mountains are so beautiful." She had said that last night looking out of the window with tears in her eyes. "The mountains are so beautiful." Her father was dying there, Mrs Ramsay knew. He was leaving them fatherless. Scolding and demonstrating (how to make a bed, how to open a window, with hands that shut and spread like a Frenchwoman's) all had folded itself quietly about her, when the girl spoke, as, after a flight through the sunshine the wings of a bird fold themselves quietly and the blue of its plumage changes from bright steel to soft purple. She had stood there silent for there was nothing to be said. He had cancer of the throat. At the recolection -- how she had stood there, how the girl had said, "At home the mountains are so beautiful," and there was no hope, no hope whatever, she had a spasm of irritation, and speaking sharply, said to James:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她抬起眼睛——她最小、最宝贝的儿子，什么鬼迷住他了？——看见了房间，看见了椅子，觉得—切都寒酸透了。椅子里面的衬垫物，正如安德鲁那天所说的，掉得满地都是。但是，她问自己，买好椅子听任它们在冬天里坏拧，有什么好处？整个冬天这所房子只有一个老太婆照管，潮湿得简直滴水。没关系：房租是两个半便士整；孩子们喜欢这地方；而离开他的图书馆、讲课和三千弟子——如果一定要准确的话，三百英里、对她的丈夫有好处；这里也有地方待客。垫子、行军床、在伦敦结束了服务生涯的歪歪倒倒的桌椅——在这里还干得不错；还有一两张相片，还有书。书，她想道，会自动越积越多。她从来没有时间去读它们。哎呀！就连人家送她的书，诗人亲笔题了词的书也没有时间读：“谨赠其意愿一定要得到服从的女土”……“比诲伦幸福的当今绝代佳人”……说起来真是个耻辱，她从未读过它们。还有克鲁姆的《论理智》和贝茨的《论波利尼西亚的野蛮风俗习惯》（“亲爱的，站好别动”，她说）——这两本哪本也不能送到灯塔去。总有一个时候，她料想，这所房子会破旧到非收拾不可的地步。要是能教会他们进门前擦擦脚，不要把海滩上的沙石带回家——那就算大收获了。螃蟹，她不得不允许带回家，如果安德鲁真想解剖它们的话，如果贾斯珀相信可以用海草做汤，也不能加以阻止，或者萝丝的东西——贝壳、芦苇、石子儿；因为她的孩子们都很有天分，只是兴趣各不相同。其结果就是，她叹了—口气，举着袜子比詹姆斯的腿时把房间从地板到天花板整个看了一遍，一个夏天又一个夏天，一切变得越来越破旧寒酸。门垫颜色褪了；墙纸垂下拍打着。你无法再看得出那上面印的是玫瑰花的图案。再说如果一幢房子里所有的门老是开着，而在整个苏格兰也没有一个锁匠会修门上的插销，东西就非坏掉不可。往画框边上搭块绿色的开司米披巾有什么用？不消两个星期披巾就会变成豌旦汤的颜色。但是让她生气的是那些门；每扇门都敞开着：她侧耳细听。客厅的门开着；过道的门开着；听上去好像卧室的门也都开着；毫无疑问，楼梯平台上的窗子也开着，因为那是她自已打开的。窗子应该开着，门应该关着——就这么简单的事，难道就谁都记不住吗？夜里她常到女仆的房间里去，发现全像烤箱样关得严严的，只有那个瑞士姑娘玛丽的房间除外，她宁肯没有澡洗也不能没有新鲜空气，不过她说过，“在她家乡，大山是多么美啊。”昨晚她眼睛里含着泪水望着窗外时就这么说的，“大山是多么美啊。”她的父亲在大山那边快要死去了。拉姆齐夫人知道。他要使他们成为没有父亲的孩子了。她责骂女仆，教她们怎么做（怎么铺床，怎么开窗，像个法国女人那样双手一会儿合拢一会儿张开），但当那个女孩子说话时，她周围的一切都静悄悄地收拢起来，就像小鸟在阳光下飞翔后悄悄收起翅膀，蓝色的羽毛从明亮的钢蓝变成了柔和的紫色。她默默地站在那里，没有话可说。他患了喉癌。当她回想起这些——她怎样站在那里，那个姑娘怎样说‘在家乡大山是多么美啊”，而已经没有希望了，没有任何希望了，她感到一阵烦躁，严厉地对詹姆斯说：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"And even if it isn't fine tomorrow," said Mrs Ramsay, raising her eyes to glance at William Bankes and Lily Briscoe as they passed, "it will be another day. And now," she said, thinking that Lily's charm was her Chinese eyes, aslant in her white, puckered little face, but it would take a clever man to see it, "and now stand up, and let me measure your leg," for they might go to the Lighthouse after all, and she must see if the stocking did not need to be an inch or two longer in the leg.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“即使明天天气不好，”拉姆齐夫人说，一面抬眼看了看走过她身边的威廉·班克斯和莉莉·布里斯柯，“还有别的日子嘛。现在，”她说道，心里在想莉莉的可爱之处是她那双中国式的眼睛，斜嵌在她白皙的皱起的小脸上，但是只有聪明的男人才能赏识，“现在站起来，让我比比你的腿。”因为说不定他们明天还是有可能到灯塔去的，她得看看袜子筒是不是需要再织长一两英寸。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But was it nothing but looks, people said? What was there behind it -- her beauty and splendour? Had he blown his brains out, they asked, had he died the week before they were married -- some other, earlier lover, of whom rumours reached one? Or was there nothing? nothing but an incomparable beauty which she lived behind, and could do nothing to disturb? For easily though she might have said at some moment of intimacy when stories of great passion, of love foiled, of ambition thwarted came her way how she too had known or felt or been through it herself, she never spoke. She was silent always. She knew then -- she knew without having learnt. Her simplicity fathomed what clever people falsified. Her singleness of mind made her drop plumb like a stone, alight exact as a bird, gave her, naturally, this swoop and fall of the spirit upon truth which delighted, eased, sustained -- falsely perhaps.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是难道只是外表看去如此吗？人们问。在她的美貌和光彩背后——是什么呢？他是开枪打碎了自己的脑袋吗，他们问，他是在他们结婚前的那个星期死去的吗——早先的、另外那个情人？有关他的谣言到处流传。还是说什么事也没有？只不过因为她生活在—个无比美丽的外貌下，不能加以搅乱？因为在亲密无间的时刻，当她听到关于伟大的激情、失意的爱情、挫败的抱负之时，尽管她很容易就可以说她也曾知道或感受到或亲身经受过这一切，她却从未说道。她总是沉默不语。她那时就知道——不用学就知道。她的纯朴使她能够看清聪明人搞错的事情。她头脑的专一使她的思想如石头正正掉下、小鸟准确飞落一样扑到事物的真相上，令人快活、轻松、持久——这也许只是假象。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Never did anybody look so sad. Bitter and black, half-way down, in the darkness, in the shaft which ran from the sunlight to the depths, perhaps a tear formed; a tear fell; the waters swayed this way and that, received it, and were at rest. Never did anybody look so sad.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从来没有人显得这样悲哀、苦涩而阴郁，半蹲在那里，在黑暗中，在从阳光的光束照及之处到黑暗的深处，也许涌出了一滴泪珠；一滴眼泪落下；水面左右涌动，接下了它，又复归平静。从来没有人显得这样悲哀。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Nature has but little clay," said Mr Bankes once, much moved by her voice on the telephone, though she was only telling him a fact about a train, "like that of which she moulded you." He saw her at the end of the line Greek, blue-eyed, straight-nosed. How incongruous it seemed to be telephoning to a woman like that. The Graces assembling seemed to have joined hands in meadows of asphodel to compose that face. Yes, he would catch the 10:30 at Euston.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有一次班克斯先生在电话上听到了她的声音，虽然她只是在告诉他一列火车的行驶时刻，却大大地打动了他，他说道，“大自然用来塑造你的泥土是多么稀有啊。”他仿佛看到了电话线另一端的她，希腊式的脸、蓝蓝的眼睛、挺直的鼻梁。给这样的女人打电话，显得多么不合适啊。聚在一起的赐人以美丽欢乐的希腊三女神似乎联合起来，在开满了常春花的草地上创造出了那张脸。是的，他要到尤斯顿去乘十点半的那趟火车。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But she's no more aware of her beauty than a child," said Mr Bankes, replacing the receiver and crossing the room to see what progress the workmen were making with an hotel which they were building at the back of his house. And he thought of Mrs Ramsay as he looked at that stir among the unfinished walls. For always, he thought, there was something incongruous to be worked into the harmony of her face. She clapped a deer-stalker's hat on her head; she ran across the lawn in galoshes to snatch a child from mischief. So that if it was her beauty merely that one thought of, one must remember the quivering thing, the living thing (they were carrying bricks up a little plank as he watched them), and work it into the picture; or if one thought of her simply as a woman, one must endow her with some freak of idiosyncrasy -- she did not like admiration -- or suppose some latent desire to doff her royalty of form as if her beauty bored her and all that men say of beauty, and she wanted only to be like other people, insignificant. He did not know. He did not know. He must go to his work.)</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“但是她像个孩子一样，并没有意识到自己的美丽。”班克斯先生说，一面放下电话，穿过房间去看在他屋后盖旅馆的工人们的进展情况。他看着在尚未完工的墙旁的忙碌景象，心里想着拉姆齐夫人。因为，他想，总是有某种不协调的东西需要糅合进她面部的和谐中去。她往头上扣一顶前后翘起的布帽子；她穿着一双高筒橡皮套鞋跑过草坪，一把抓住一个正要捣蛋的孩子。所以，如果你想到的只是她的美丽外貌，就还必须记住那颤动着的、活生生的东西（当他看着工人的时候，他们正踩着一块小木板往上运砖头），并且把它糅进你看到的画面中去；或者，如果你只是把她看做一个女人，那就必须赋予她某种奇特的癖性；或者认为她有某种潜在的、想要摈弃自己高贵的外形的欲望，似乎她的美貌和男人们所谈到的一切关于美貌的话都使她感到厌倦，而她只希望和别的人一样，做个微不足道的平常人。他不知道。他不知道。他必须去工作了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Knitting her reddish-brown hairy stocking, with her head outlined absurdly by the gilt frame, the green shawl which she had tossed over the edge of the frame, and the authenticated masterpiece by Michael Angelo, Mrs Ramsay smoothed out what had been harsh in her manner a moment before, raised his head, and kissed her little boy on the forehead. "Let us find another picture to cut out," she said.</div>
