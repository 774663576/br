<div class="line_en">Breakfast at that early hour seemed odd, and even Hannah's familiar face looked unnatural as she flew about her kitchen with her nightcap on. The big trunk stood ready in the hall, Mother's cloak and bonnet lay on the sofa, and Mother herself sat trying to eat, but looking so pale and worn with sleeplessness and anxiety that the girls found it very hard to keep their resolution. Meg's eyes kept filling in spite of herself, Jo was obliged to hide her face in the kitchen roller more than once, and the little girls wore a grave, troubled expression, as if sorrow was a new experience to them.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the cold gray dawn the sisters lit their lamp and read their chapter with an earnestness never felt before. For now the shadow of a real trouble had come, the little books were full of help and comfort, and as they dressed, they agreed to say goodbye cheerfully and hopefully, and send their mother on her anxious journey unsaddened by tears or complaints from them. Everything seemed very strange when they went down, so dim and still outside, so full of light and bustle within.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="天方蒙蒙亮，姐妹们便冒着严寒，点亮灯，以前所未有的热诚阅读她们的小册子，因为一项真正的麻烦已经降临到她们身上，而这些小书当中随处可以寻到帮助和宽慰。穿衣的时候，她们约定要高高兴兴地跟母亲道别、不流泪、不诉苦，让她轻松上路。她们走下楼时一切都似乎变得十分陌生——外头天色灰暗、鸦雀无声，里头却灯火透亮、一片忙乱。">查看中文翻译</div>

I have no fears for you, yet I am anxious that you should take this trouble rightly. Don't grieve and fret when I am gone, or think that you can be idle and comfort yourselves by being idle and trying to forget. Go on with your work as usual, for work is a blessed solace. Hope and keep busy, and whatever happens, remember that you never can be fatherless."</div>

<div class="line_en">The rattle of an approaching carriage made them all start and listen. That was the hard minute, but the girls stood it well. No one cried, no one ran away or uttered a lamentation, though their hearts were very heavy as they sent loving messages to Father, remembering, as they spoke that it might be too late to deliver them. They kissed their mother quietly, clung about her tenderly, and tried to wave their hands cheerfully when she drove away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们会的！”这时传来嘎嗒嘎嗒的马车声，大家跳起来侧耳细听。痛苦的时刻到了，但姑娘们强忍悲伤：她们让母亲转达对父亲的问候，虽然她们想到这些话或许已经太迟。没有人哭泣，没有人躲避，也没有叹息，虽然她们心里都感到沉甸甸的；大家轻轻吻别母亲，然后目送着马车离去，强作欢颜，挥手告别。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">News from their father comforted the girls very much, for though dangerously ill, the presence of the best and tenderest of nurses had already done him good. Mr. Brooke sent a bulletin every day, and as the head of the family, Meg insisted on reading the dispatches, which grew more cheerful as the week passed. At first, everyone was eager to write, and plump envelopes were carefully poked into the letter box by one or other of the sisters, who felt rather important with their Washington correspondence. As one of these packets contained characteristic notes from the party, we will rob an imaginary mail, and read them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="父亲方面传来的消息使姑娘们大感欣慰。尽管病情严重，在医院经过精心的医护理后，他已逐渐康复。布鲁克先生每天都寄来一份病情报告。梅格身为一家之长，每次都坚持自己来读。随着时间的推移，信中的消息越来越令人振奋。起初四姐妹都争着写信，写好后，由其中一人小心翼翼地把厚厚的信封塞进邮筒，大家都郑重其事地看待这些华盛顿通信。信中有几封皮具代表性，我们不妨截下来读一读：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It is impossible to tell you how happy your last letter made us, for the news was so good we couldn't help laughing and crying over it. How very kind Mr. Brooke is, and how fortunate that Mr. Laurence's business detains him near you so long, since he is so useful to you and Father. The girls are all as good as gold. Jo helps me with the sewing, and insists on doing all sorts of hard jobs. I should be afraid she might overdo, if I didn't know her 'moral fit' wouldn't last long. Beth is as regular about her tasks as a clock, and never forgets what you told her. She grieves about Father, and looks sober except when she is at her little piano. Amy minds me nicely, and I take great care of her. She does her own hair, and I am teaching her to make buttonholes and mend her stockings. She tries very hard, and I know you will be pleased with her improvement when you come. Mr. Laurence watches over us like a motherly old hen, as Jo says, and Laurie is very kind and neighborly. He and Jo keep us merry, for we get pretty blue sometimes, and feel like orphans, with you so far away. Hannah is a perfect saint. She does not scold at all, and always calls me Miss Margaret, which is quite proper, you know, and treats me with respect. We are all well and busy, but we long, day and night, to have you back. Give my dearest love to Father, and believe me, ever your own…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="读了您的来信后，我们的喜悦心情简直没法形容，您捎来的大好消息令我们高兴得又笑又哭。布鲁克先生不愧是菩萨心肠，由于劳伦斯先生生意上的缘故，他能在你们身边陪伴多时，并悉心照顾，实乃万幸，因为他对你和父亲来说是那么有用。妹妹们个个乖巧听话。乔帮我干针线活，还坚持要做各种最难做的工夫。幸亏我知道她的‘道德冲动’有如昙花一现，才不至于担心她操劳过度。贝思尽忠职守，从不忘记您告诉她的话，她思虑爸爸，终日心事重重，只有坐在她的小钢琴边时才显得轻松开怀。艾美很听我的话，我也十分细心地照顾她。她自己梳头，我正教她开钮孔和缝补袜子。她干得很起劲，您回来的时候一定会对她的进步感到满意。劳伦斯先生像老母鸡一样照看我们——这是乔说的话，劳里待我们也十分热情友好。你们远在他方，我们有时悒悒不乐，觉得自己像个孤儿，是劳里和乔使我们快乐起来。罕娜是个大圣人；她从不骂人，总是称我为‘玛格丽特小姐’，这称呼十分体面，您知道，而且待我十分尊重。我们人人安好，个个忙碌，只是日夜盼望你们回来。请转达我对爸爸最诚挚的爱。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Three cheers for dear Father! Brooke was a trump to telegraph right off, and let us know the minute he was better. I rushed up garret when the letter came, and tried to thank god for being so good to us, but I could only cry, and say, "I'm glad! I'm glad!" Didn't that do as well as a regular prayer? For I felt a great many in my heart. We have such funny times, and now I can enjoy them, for everyone is so desperately good, it's like living in a nest of turtledoves. You'd laugh to see Meg head the table and try to be motherish. She gets prettier every day, and I'm in love with her sometimes. The children are regular archangels, and I -- well, I'm Jo, and never shall be anything else. Oh, I must tell you that I came near having a quarrel with Laurie. I freed my mind about a silly little thing, and he was offended. I was right, but didn't speak as I ought, and he marched home, saying he wouldn't come again till I begged pardon. I declared I wouldn't and got mad. It lasted all day. I felt bad and wanted you very much. Laurie and I are both so proud, it's hard to beg pardon. But I thought he'd come to it, for I was in the right. He didn't come, and just at night I remembered what you said when Amy fell into the river. I read my little book, felt better, resolved not to let the sun set on my anger, and ran over to tell Laurie I was sorry. I met him at the gate, coming for the same thing. We both laughed, begged each other's pardon, and felt all good and comfortable again.</div>

I felt bad but did not fret I bear my troubles well but I do wish Hannah would put more starch in my aprons and have buckwheats every day. Can't she? Didn't I make that interrigation point nice?

Beth is the best of little creeters, and a sight of help to me, bein so forehanded and dependable. She tries to learn everything, and really goes to market beyond her years, likewise keeps accounts, with my help, quite wonderful. We have got on very economical so fur. I don't let the girls hev coffee only once a week, accordin to your wish, and keep em on plain wholesome vittles. Amy does well without frettin, wearin her best clothes and eatin sweet stuff. Mr. Laurie is as full of didoes as usual, and turns the house upside down frequent, but he heartens the girls, so I let em hev full swing. The old gentleman sends heaps of things, and is rather wearin, but means wal, and it aint my place to say nothin. My bread is riz, so no more at this time.
