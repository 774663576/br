<div class="line_en">I have now been living several days in the same hotel with Jacob Fuller. I have his scent; I could track him through ten divisions of infantry and find him. I have often been near him and heard him talk. He owns a good mine, and has a fair income from it; but he is not rich. He learned mining in a good way; by working at it for wages. He is a cheerful creature, and his forty-three years sit lightly upon him; he could pass for a younger man; say thirty-six or thirty-seven. He has never married again; passes himself off for a widower. He stands well, is liked, is popular, and has many friends. Even I feel a drawing toward him; the paternal blood in me making its claim. How blind and unreasoning and arbitrary are some of the laws of nature; the most of them, in fact! My task is become hard now; you realize it? you comprehend, and make allowances?; and the fire of it has cooled, more than I like to confess to myself. But I will carry it out. Even with the pleasure paled, the duty remains, and I will not spare him.</div>

<div class="line_en">When Fuller came in he had the Notice to Leave; folded up; in one hand, and the newspaper in the other; and it gave me more than half a pang to see him. His cheerfulness was all gone, and he looked old and pinched and ashy. And then; only think of the things he had to listen to! Mamma, he heard his own unsuspecting friends describe him with epithets and characterizations drawn from the very dictionaries and phrase-books of Satans own authorized editions down below. And more than that, he had to agree with the verdicts and applaud them. His applause tasted bitter in his mouth, though; he could not disguise that from me; and it was observable that his appetite was gone; he only nibbled; he couldn't eat. Finally a man said:</div>

He played his cards well; said he would take $40,000; a quarter in cash, the rest in safe notes; but that as he greatly needed money on account of his new purchase, he would diminish his terms for cash in full. He sold out for $30,000. And then, what do you think he did? He asked for greenbacks, and took them, saying the man in Mexico was a New-Englander, with a head full of crotchets, and preferred greenbacks to gold or drafts. People thought it queer, since a draft on New York could produce greenbacks quite conveniently. There was talk of this odd thing, but only for a day; that is as long as any topic lasts in Denver.</div>

<div class="line_en">I was watching, all the time. As soon as the sale was completed and the money paid; which was on the 11th; I began to stick to Fullers track without dropping it for a moment. That night; no, 12th, for it was a little past midnight; I tracked him to his room, which was four doors from mine in the same hall; then I went back and put on my muddy day-laborer disguise, darkened my complexion, and sat down in my room in the gloom, with a gripsack handy, with a change in it, and my door ajar. For I suspected that the bird would take wing now. In half an hour an old woman passed by, carrying a grip: I caught the familiar whiff, and followed with my grip, for it was Fuller. He left the hotel by a side entrance, and at the corner he turned up an unfrequented street and walked three blocks in a light rain and a heavy darkness, and got into a two-horse hack, which of course was waiting for him by appointment. I took a seat (uninvited) on the trunk platform behind, and we drove briskly off. We drove ten miles, and the hack stopped at a way-station and was discharged. Fuller got out and took a seat on a barrow under the awning, as far as he could get from the light; I went inside, and watched the ticket-office. Fuller bought no ticket; I bought none. Presently the train came along, and he boarded a car; I entered the same car at the other end, and came down the aisle and took the seat behind him. When he paid the conductor and named his objective point, I dropped back several seats, while the conductor was changing a bill, and when he came to me I paid to the same place; about a hundred miles westward.</div>

He was a laborer, like myself, and wore bushy false whiskers. His outfit was perfect, and he could do the character without thinking about it, for he had served the trade for wages. His nearest friend could not have recognized him. At last he located himself here, the obscurest little mountain camp in Montana; he has a shanty, and goes out prospecting daily; is gone all day, and avoids society. I am living at a miners boarding-house, and it is an awful place: the bunks, the food, the dirt; everything.</div>

Ah, but the change in him! He never smiles, and he keeps quite to himself, consorting with on one; he who was so fond of company and so cheery only two months ago.

<div class="line_en">You already know how well I have searched the States from Colorado to the Pacinc, and how nearly I came to getting him once. Well, I have had another close miss. It was here, yesterday. I struck his trail, hot, on the street, and followed it on a run to a cheap hotel. That was a costly mistake; a dog would have gone the other way. But I am only part dog, and can get very humanly stupid when excited. He had been stopping in that house ten days; I almost know, now, that he stops long nowhere, the past six or eight months, but is rest-less and has to keep moving. I understand that feeling! and I know what it is to feel it. He still uses the name he had registered when I came so near catching him nine months ago; James Walker; doubtless the same he adopted when he fled from Silver Gulch. An unpretending man, and has small taste for fancy names. I recognized the hand easily, through its slight disguise. A square man, and not good at shams and pretenses.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="您已经知道，我怎样把科罗拉多到太平洋沿岸的各州搜寻了一遍，有一次我差一点点就追上他了。说起来，我还有一次和他失之交臂。这就是昨天在这儿发生的事情。我在大街上嗅到了他刚刚留下的踪迹，顺著这踪迹跑到了一家低档旅馆。这是一个得不偿失的错误，连狗都不会这样干的。不过我毕竟不完全像狗，在激动的时候会做和人一模一样的蠢事。他曾经在那个旅馆里住了十天；如今我了解得差不多了：在过去的六到八个月里，他从不在一处久留，而是不停地迁徒。我能理解这种心情！我也知道这种生活的感觉。他还用著九个月前我差点儿追上他时用的那个名字——‘詹姆士·沃克’；他从西尔沃·古其出逃以后就用这个名字。他胸无城府，并没有取花哨假名字的嗜好。透过并不刻意的伪装，我很容易就认出了他的笔迹。他是个实实在在的汉子，并不善于弄虚作假。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They said he was just gone, on a journey; left no address; didn't say where he was going; looked frightened when asked to leave his address; had no baggage but a cheap valise; carried it off on foot; a stingy old person, and not much loss to the house. Old! I suppose he is, now. I hardly heard; I was there but a moment. I rushed along his trail, and it led me to a wharf. Mother, the smoke of the steamer he had taken was just fading out on the horizon! I should have saved half an hour if I had gone in the right direction at first. I could have taken a fast tug, and should have stood a chance of catching that vessel. She is bound for Melbourne.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="人家说他刚走，出门了；没有留下联系地址，也没说要到哪儿去。人家要他留下联系地址的时候，看来他有点儿惊慌失措。他随身没带什么像样的行李，只有一个廉价旅行箱；提著箱子步行离开了旅馆——‘是个挺节省的老头儿，也不大恋家。’‘老头儿！’我想如今他是老了。我再也听不下去了，只在旅馆呆了一小会儿。我循著他的踪迹紧追，一直追到码头。母亲，他乘坐的那艘汽船冒出的黑烟才刚刚消失在地平线上！假如一开始我走对了方向的话，就能节省半个钟头了。如果我搭乘一艘快艇，还有可能赶上那艘汽船。那般汽船是开往墨尔本的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I am taking a rest, now; modified by searchings for the lost trail. I was tired to death, mother, and low-spirited, and sometimes coming uncomfortably near to losing hope; but the miners in this little camp are good fellows, and I am used to their sort this long time back; and their breezy ways freshen a person up and make him forget his troubles. I have been here a month. I am cabining with a young fellow named Sammy Hillyer, about twenty-five, the only son of his mother; like me; and loves her dearly, and writes to her every week; part of which is like me. He is a timid body, and in the matter of intellect; well, he cannot be depended upon to set a river on fire; but no matter, he is well liked; he is good and fine, and it is meat and bread and rest and luxury to sit and talk with him and have a comradeship again. I wish James Walker could have it. He had friends; he liked company. That brings up that picture of him, the time that I saw him last. The pathos of it! It comes before me often and often. At that very time, poor thing, I was girding up my conscience to make him move on again!</div>

<div class="line_en">Hillyers heart is better than mine, better than anybodys in the community, I suppose, for he is the one friend of the black sheep of the camp; Flint Buckner; and the only man Flint ever talks with or allows to talk with him. He says he knows Flints history, and that it is trouble that has made him what he is, and so one ought to be as charitable toward him as one can. Now none but a pretty large heart could find space to accommodate a lodger like Flint Buckner, from all I hear about him outside. I think that this one detail will give you a better idea of Sammys character than any labored-out description I could furnish you of him. In one of our talks he said something about like this: Flint is a kinsman of mine, and be pours out all his troubles to me; empties his breast from time to time, or I reckon it would burst. There couldn't be any unhappier man, Archy Stillman; his life has been made up of misery of mind; he isnt near as old as he looks. He has lost the feel of reposefulness and peace; oh, years and years ago! He doesn't know what good luck is; never has had any; often says he wishes he was in the other hell, he is so tired of this one.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="希里尔的心肠比我好，我想，他的心肠比这儿的所有人都好，因为他是这个屯子里的害群之马弗林特·布克纳惟一的朋友，也是弗林特惟一与之交谈而且允许与他交谈的人。他说，他知道弗林特的来历，正是弗林特自己的不幸才使他成了现在这个样子，所以，人们应该尽量善待他。如今只有一个非常开阔的胸怀才能容得下弗林特·布克纳这样的人，我听外头所有的人谈起希里尔时都这样说。我想，这句话会让您了解萨姆的为人，比我唠唠刀刀的描述半天更能说明问题。有一次我们聊天时，他说了一段话，大意是：“弗林特和我对心思，他会把满肚子苦水倒给我——我猜，如果他不经常倒一倒苦水，就会发作。在这儿的男人里面，阿其·斯蒂尔曼愁事最多——看起来特别老相。他没有过一天舒心的日子——唉，多少年来都是这样！他不知道什么是好运气——也从来没碰上过好运气；还总是说他恨不得下另外那个地狱，他在这个地狱里呆烦了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
