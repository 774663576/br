<div class="line_en">At the Red House Nancy was waiting patiently for Godfrey to come home to tea. Suddenly one of the servants ran into the sitting-room, crying excitedly, "Madam, there are lots of people in the street! They're all running the same way, towards the quarry! Perhaps there's been an accident!"</div>

<div class="line_en">"Jane, don't get so excited," replied Nancy calmly. "I expect it's nothing serious. Go and get the tea ready. Mr Godfrey will be back soon." But secretly she was saying to herself, "I hope nothing's happened to Godfrey!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“简，别那么激动，”南茜平静地说，“我想不会有什么重要的事。去拿茶来，戈弗雷先生快回来了。”可她心里对自己说，“千万别是戈弗雷有什么事儿！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She stopped suddenly when she saw Godfrey's shaking hands and white face. She put her hand on his arm, but he did not seem to notice, and threw himself into a chair.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她猛地停了下来。她看到戈弗雷双手发抖，脸色惨白。南茜把手放在他臂上，可他好像没感觉。他跌坐在一把椅子上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Sit down -- Nancy," he said with difficulty. "I came back as soon as I could, to prevent anyone telling you except me. It's terrible news for me, but I'm more worried about how you will feel about it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“坐下——南茜，”他艰难地说，“我尽可能快地赶回来，我真怕别人来告诉你。这对我是个可怕的消息，可我更担心你会怎么想。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You know the men have been draining our fields near the quarry. Well, as a result, the quarry has suddenly gone dry, and we've found him lying at the bottom. We know it's him because he's wearing his watch and his rings."</div>

<div class="line_en">"No, it's nobody living," said Godfrey. "It's Dunstan, my brother, who left home sixteen years ago and never came back. We've found him…found his body -- all that's left of it -- in the old quarry."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，不关活人的事儿，”戈弗雷说，“是我弟弟邓斯坦，他从16年前离家后一直没有回来。我们找到他了……找到了他的尸体——所有剩下的部分——在采石场里。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He paused, looking worriedly at Nancy. But she sat quite still, although her face looked rather white.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I had to tell you. I couldn't keep it from you,"Godfrey continued, and then stopped, looking at the ground for two long minutes. Nancy knew that he had something more to say. Finally Godfrey lifted his eyes to her face, and said, "Everybody's secrets are discovered sooner or later, Nancy. I've lived with a secret ever since I married you, but I'm going to confess it now. I don't want you to discover it from someone else, or hear about it when I'm dead, I was weak and hesitating when I was younger -- I'm going to be firm with myself now."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我得告诉你，我不能向你隐瞒，”戈弗雷停下来，眼睛盯着地板看了两分钟。南茜知道他还有话要说。终于戈弗雷抬起了眼看着南茜的脸，说：“每个人的秘密早晚都会被发现，南茜。我们结婚以后我一直隐藏着一个秘密，现在我要把它向你坦白。我不想让你从别人那里发现它，或是在我死了以后再听到它。年轻的时候我脆弱而且优柔寡断——现在我要坚强起来。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Nancy," said Godfrey slowly, "when I married you, I hid something from you -- I was wrong not to tell you. That woman Silas Marner found dead in the snow -- Eppie's mother -- that poor woman -- was my wife. Eppie is my child."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="南茜害怕地看着丈夫，什么也说不出。他会隐瞒了什么呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Perhaps you won't be able to love me any more," he said, his voice trembling a little.</div>

<div class="line_en">Still Nancy was silent, looking down at her hands. And Godfrey almost expected her to get up and say she would leave him and go to live with her father and sister. She was so religious, and so firm in her ideas of right and wrong!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="南茜看着自己的手，仍然沉默着。戈弗雷想她一定会站起来说她要离开他去和父亲和姐姐生活在一起。她是那么的虔诚，那么的是非分明！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But at last she lifted her eyes to his and spoke. She did not sound angry, but only sad. "Oh Godfrey, why didn't you tell me this long ago? I didn't know Eppie was yours and so I re fused to adopt her. Of course I'd accept your child into our home! But -- oh, Godfrey -- how sad to think we've spent all these years with no children! Why didn't you confess the truth before we married? We could be so happy now, with a beautiful daughter, who would love me as her mother!" tears were running down Nancy's face But Nancy, cried Godfrey, bitterly angry with himself, "I couldn't tell you everything! I was in danger of losing you if I told you the truth!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但最后南茜抬眼看着戈弗雷，声音悲伤，但并不愤怒：“戈弗雷，你怎么能那么长时间不告诉我呢？我不知道埃比是你的女儿，所以不同意领养她。我当然应当接纳你的孩子来我们的家。哦，戈弗雷——这么多年没有孩子是多不容易呀！为什么结婚前你不告诉我实情？那样我们多快活，会有一个漂亮的女儿，她会像爱她的妈妈那样爱我！”泪水顺着南茜的脸颊流了下来。“可是南茜，”戈弗雷对自己很气恼，“我不能告诉你这些！我怕说了实话我就会失去你！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I don't know about that, Godfrey. I certainly never wanted to marry anyone else But it wasn't worth doing wrong just so that you could marry me. And our marriage hasn't been as happy for you as you thought it would be." There was a sad smile on Nancy's face as she said the last words.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我也不知道，戈弗雷，我从没想过要嫁给别人，可你不值得为娶我而做错事，而且我们的婚姻也不像你想的那么幸福。”说到最后南茜苦笑了一下。">查看中文翻译</div>
