<div class="line_en">Granny and Elsa are playing Monopoly. Granny doesn't say anything about cancer, for Elsa's sake. And Elsa doesn't say anything about death, for Granny's sake. Because Granny doesn't like talking about death, especially not her own. So when Elsa's mum and the doctors leave the room to talk in low, serious voices in the corridor, Elsa tries not to look worried. That doesn't really work either.</div>

<div class="line_en">That's why she knows that one of the things people say about Granny most often when she's not around is, "This time she's really crossed the line." Britt-Marie is always saying it. Elsa assumes this is why Granny likes the kingdom of Miamas so much: you can't cross the line in Miamas, because the kingdom is endless. And not like on television when people toss their hair about and say that they "have no boundaries," but properly, without any limits, because no one knows for certain where Miamas begins and ends. This is partly because unlike the other five kingdoms in the Land-of-Almost-Awake, which are mainly built of stone and mortar, Miamas is wholly made of imagination. It could also be slightly because the Miamas city wall has an insanely moody temperament and may suddenly one morning have the idea of moving itself a mile or two into the forest because it needs a bit of "me time." Only to move twice as far back in the opposite direction the next morning, because it has decided to wall in some dragon or troll that for one reason or another it has decided to be grumpy with. (Usually because the dragon or the troll has been up all night drinking schnapps and weeing on the wall while sleeping, Granny suggests.)</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱莎知道人们经常在背后说外婆“这一次她真的‘越界’了”。布里特—玛丽总是这么说。爱莎估计这就是为什么外婆特别喜欢密阿玛斯王国的原因。在密阿玛斯，你没法越界，因为王国是无边无界的。不像电视里那些甩着头发说自己“无极限”的人，密阿玛斯是真的没有边界，没有人知道密阿玛斯从何处起始又到何处终止。其中一部分原因是，密阿玛斯不像不眠大陆的其他五个王国，主要用石头和泥土建造。密阿玛斯完全由想象造就。还有一小部分原因是，密阿玛斯的城墙性格非常暴躁，它会突然在某个早上想要一点儿“独处时光”，就把自己往森林里移动好几公里。而第二天早上，某头龙或者巨魔出于这样那样的原因惹到了它，它又会向相反方向移动两倍距离以进行包围。（通常原因是那头龙或巨魔整晚喝着杜松子酒，在城墙上睡觉的时候尿它身上了，外婆是这么猜测的。）">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There are more trolls and dragons in Miamas than in any other of the five kingdoms in the Land-of-Almost-Awake, you see, because the main export industry in Miamas is fairy tales. Trolls and dragons have excellent employment prospects in Miamas because stories need villains. "Of course, it hasn't always been like this," Granny sometimes muses. "There was a time when the dragons had been almost forgotten by Miamas's storytellers, particularly the ones who'd grown a little long in the tooth." Then she recounts the whole story about how the dragons were causing too much trouble in Miamas, drifting about without jobs, drinking schnapps and smoking cigars and getting involved in violent confrontations with the city wall. So in the end the people of Miamas begged Granny to help them come up with some kind of practical job-creation scheme. And that's when Granny had the idea that dragons should guard treasures at the ends of the tales.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="密阿玛斯的巨魔和龙比不眠大陆的其他五个王国都要多，因为密阿玛斯的主要出口产业是童话故事，而故事总需要反派，所以巨魔和龙在密阿玛斯有非常光明的职业前景。“当然，并不是一开始就这样。”外婆有时候会自言自语地说，“曾经，龙几乎被密阿玛斯的故事讲述者们遗忘了，特别是那些牙齿长得太长的。”然后她会重新细述一遍整件事情：龙在密阿玛斯惹是生非，因为没有工作所以无所事事，到处流浪，喝着杜松子酒，抽着雪茄，和城墙起暴力冲突。于是密阿玛斯的人们请求外婆帮他们想一个可行的创造就业岗位的计划。就是那时，外婆想出了在故事的最后让龙来守卫宝藏的主意。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Up until that point, it had actually been a massive narrative problem, the fact that heroes in fairy tales looked for a treasure and, once they had located it in some deep cave, only had to nip inside to pick it up. Just like that. No epic closing battles or dramatic apexes or anything. "All you could do was play worthless video games afterwards," Granny said, nodding somberly. Granny knows all about it, because last summer Elsa taught her how to play a game called World of Warcraft and Granny played it around the clock for several weeks until Mum said she was beginning to "exhibit disturbing tendencies" and banned her from sleeping in Elsa's room from then on.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但由此产生一个很严重的情节问题：原先，童话故事中寻找宝藏的勇士一旦确定了宝藏的位置——某个深深的洞穴，只需要跑进去把它拿出来就行了，就这么简单。没有史诗般的决战或是戏剧化的高潮。“之后你能做的就是玩一局毫无意义的电脑游戏。”外婆阴沉地点着头说。她很了解电脑游戏，去年夏天爱莎教她玩了一个叫《魔兽世界》的游戏，外婆没日没夜地玩了好几周，直到妈妈说外婆已经开始“出现令人不安的倾向”，并从此以后严禁外婆睡在爱莎的房间。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">One story was about the sea-angel, burdened by a curse that forced her to drift up and down the coast of the Land-of-Almost-Awake after losing her beloved. And another story was about the Chosen One, the most universally loved dancer in Mimovas, which is the kingdom all music comes from. In the fairy tale the shadows tried to abduct the Chosen One in order to destroy Mimovas, but the cloud animals saved him and flew him all the way back to Miamas. And when the shadows came after them, all the inhabitants of the six kingdoms of the Land-of-Almost-Awake -- the princes, princesses, knights, soldiers, trolls, angels, and the witch -- agreed to protect the Chosen One. And that was when the War-Without-End started. It raged for an eternity of ten thousand fairy tales, until the wurses and Wolfheart came out of the forest and led the good army into the last battle and forced the shadows back across the sea.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有一个故事说的是一位海天使，在失去了她爱的人之后，身负诅咒，被迫在不眠大陆的海岸边随波沉浮。还有一个故事关于天选之子——音乐发源地密莫瓦斯最受喜爱的舞者。暗影试图劫持天选之子，以此来摧毁密莫瓦斯，但云兽救了他并载着他一路飞回了密阿玛斯。在他们被暗影追击时，不眠大陆六大王国的所有居民——王子们、公主们、骑士们、士兵们、巨魔们、天使们和那个女巫——同意一起保护天选之子。这就是无尽战争的开端，它持续了“一万个童话永恒”，直到呜嘶和狼心从森林中出现，率领英勇的军队，投入最后一场战役，迫使暗影退回到海中。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And then she wipes the tears from Elsa's cheeks. And Elsa points out that you're supposed to say "to he who's waiting," not "him." And they argue a bit about that, as usual. And then they play Monopoly and eat cinnamon buns and talk about who'd win a fight between Harry Potter and Spider-Man. Bloody pathetic discussion, of course, thinks Elsa. But Granny likes nattering on about these types of things because she's too immature to understand that Harry Potter would have crushed Spider-Man.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她擦去爱莎脸颊上的眼泪。然后她们玩了大富翁，吃了肉桂卷，讨论了一下如果哈利·波特和蜘蛛侠打起来谁会赢。当然爱莎认为结果毋庸置疑，但外婆喜欢对这种事情瞎扯个没完，因为她太幼稚了，不明白哈利·波特会碾压蜘蛛侠。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Are you really going to get well?" Elsa asks with the reluctance of an almost-eight-year-old asking a question to which she already knows she doesn't want to know the answer.</div>

<div class="line_en">Granny gets out some more cinnamon buns from large paper bags under another pillow. Not that she has to hide the cinnamon buns from Elsa's mum the way she has to hide the beer from Elsa's mum, but she likes keeping them together because she likes eating them together. Beer and cinnamon buns is Granny's favorite snack. Elsa recognizes the name of the bakery on the bags; Granny only eats cinnamon buns from that one bakery, because she says no one else knows how to make real Mirevas cinnamon buns. In fact, it's the national dish of the Land-of-Almost-Awake. One very bad thing about it is that one can only have the national dish on the national day. But a very good thing about it is that in the Land-of-Almost-Awake, every day is the national day. As Granny likes to put it, "In the end the problem disappears, said the old lady who crapped in the sink." Elsa hopes with all her might that this doesn't mean Granny is going to start using the kitchen sink with the door left open.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="外婆从另一个枕头下拿出一个大纸袋，里面有更多的肉桂卷。她倒是不必像藏啤酒那样把肉桂卷也藏起来，不让爱莎妈妈发现，她只是喜欢把这两样放在一起，因为她喜欢一块儿吃。啤酒和肉桂卷是外婆最喜欢的零食。爱莎认出了纸袋上的面包店名，外婆只吃这一家面包店的肉桂卷，她说别家都不知道怎么做正宗的密阿玛斯肉桂卷。事实上，这是不眠大陆的国菜。可惜的是，只有国庆日才能吃国菜，而幸运的是，在不眠大陆，每天都是国庆日。外婆的说法是：“问题终会消失，在水槽解手的老太太如是说。”爱莎诚心诚意地希望，这并不意味着外婆将要敞着门用厨房水槽解手。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And in an apartment block on the other side of town, everyone wakes up with a start when the hound in the first-floor flat, without any warning, starts howling. Louder and more heartrendingly than anything they have ever heard coming out of the primal depths of any animal. As if it is singing with the sorrow and yearning of an eternity of ten thousand fairy tales. It howls for hours, all through the night, until dawn.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="而在小镇另一头的一片住宅区，所有人都被二楼公寓里一条猎犬毫无预兆、突然爆发的叫声惊醒。那么响，那么揪心，他们从未听过动物从本能深处发出的这种号叫声。仿佛它在哀唱，在“一万个童话永恒”的时间里嘶吼。它长嚎了几个小时，从黑夜直到黎明。">查看中文翻译</div>
