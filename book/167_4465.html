<div class="line_cn" title="“从罗柏？”布兰兴奋起来，他等不及阿多，便让酒肚子背他上楼。酒肚子是个壮汉，但块头没阿多大，力量也差了不少。好不容易到达学士的住所，他已经满脸通红，气喘吁吁。瑞肯已经到了，两个瓦德·佛雷也在。">查看中文翻译</div>

"There's the wolf dreams, those aren't so bad as the others. I run and hunt and kill squirrels. And there's dreams where the crow comes and tells me to fly. Sometimes the tree is in those dreams too, calling my name. That frightens me. But the worst dreams are when I fall." He looked down into the yard, feeling miserable. "I never used to fall before. When I climbed. I went everyplace, up on the roofs and along the walls, I used to feed the crows in the Burned Tower. Mother was afraid that I would fall but I knew I never would. Only I did, and now when I sleep I fall all the time."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="私生子本人已丧命，布兰在晚宴上得知这个消息。罗德利克爵士的部下在霍伍德家领地里逮到他时，他正干些可怕事情（布兰弄不清到底是什么，只知道这些事似乎等人死了才能干）。他试图逃跑，结果被射杀。然而，人们来得太晚，已来不及拯救可怜的霍伍德伯爵夫人。结婚之后，私生子把她锁在塔里，还不给吃的。布兰听人说，当罗德利克爵士劈门进去时，发现她满嘴鲜血，指头全给生生咬断。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was a few days after Alebelly's bath that Ser Rodrik returned to Winterfell with his prisoner, a fleshy young man with fat moist lips and long hair who smelled like a privy, even worse than Alebelly had. "Reek, he's called," Hayhead said when Bran asked who it was. "I never heard his true name. He served the Bastard of Bolton and helped him murder Lady Hornwood, they say."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这之后没几天，罗德利克爵士带着俘虏回到临冬城，此人是个肥胖的青年男子，嘴唇丰厚润湿，头发长长的。他闻起来有茅坑的味道，比前阵子的酒肚子还糟糕。“大家叫他‘臭佬’，”布兰问起姓名，稻草头回答，“我没听过他的真名，只听说他为波顿的私生子卖命，帮他谋害了霍伍德伯爵夫人。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"The monster has tied us a thorny knot," the old knight told Maester Luwin. "Like it or no, Lady Hornwood was his wife. He made her say the vows before both septon and heart tree, and bedded her that very night before witnesses. She signed a will naming him as heir and fixed her seal to it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这怪物给咱们系了个棘手的死结，”老骑士对鲁温师傅说，“不管是否情愿，霍伍德伯爵夫人从法理上说都是他的妻子。他让她在圣堂里和心树下发了婚誓，当晚还在众目睽睽之下跟她上床。她更签下遗嘱，声明这该死的杂种为她的继承人，上面封了她家族的蜡印。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Roose Bolton may not agree. Not with land at issue." Ser Rodrik looked unhappy. "Would that I could take this serving man's head off as well, he's as bad as his master. But I fear I must keep him alive until Robb returns from his wars. He is the only witness to the worst of the Bastard's crimes. Perhaps when Lord Bolton hears his tale, he will abandon his claim, but meantime we have Manderly knights and Dreadfort men killing one another in Hornwood forests, and I lack the strength to stop them." The old knight turned in his seat and gave Bran a stern look. "And what have you been about while I've been away, my lord prince? Commanding our guardsmen not to wash? Do you want them smelling like this Reek, is that it?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“卢斯·波顿可不会这么看，毕竟这关系到一大片领地的归属。”罗德利克爵士有些闷闷不乐。“所以我不得不暂时留这狗奴才一命，照说他跟他主人一般该死。我得留着他，直到罗柏结束战争返回北境，因为他是惟一一个目睹那杂种罪行的证人。但愿波顿大人听过他的证词后，会自动放弃领土要求。眼下，曼德勒家的骑士和波顿的部队已经在霍伍德森林里真刀真枪地干了起来，我却无力制止。”老骑士转过身，严厉地望着布兰。“我走之后你干了些什么，王子殿下？叫我的守卫别洗澡？你打算让他们闻起来都像那个臭佬，是吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Maester Luwin tugged at his chain collar. "The Reed boy believes he sees the future in his dreams, Ser Rodrik. I've spoken to Bran about the uncertainty of such prophecies, but if truth be told, there is trouble along the Stony Shore. Raiders in longships, plundering fishing villages. Raping and burning. Leobald Tallhart has sent his nephew Benfred to deal with them, but I expect they'll take to their ships and flee at the first sight of armed men."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="鲁温师傅拉拉颈链。“黎德家的男孩相信自己能从梦中预见未来，罗德利克爵士。我给布兰讲过，这样的预言是不可靠的，然而实话实说，磐石海岸的确出了点麻烦。长船载着掠夺者前来，洗劫渔村，奸淫烧杀，干尽坏事。兰巴德·陶哈已派侄子本福德前去处理，但我估计他们只要发现我方人马出现便会立刻上船，逃得无影无踪。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Aye, and strike somewhere else. The Others take all such cowards. They would never dare, no more than the Bastard of Bolton, if our main strength were not a thousand leagues south." Ser Rodrik looked at Bran. "What else did the lad tell you?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是啊，然后又去别处打家劫舍。异鬼把这群懦夫抓走吧！若非我们的军队千里迢迢去了南方，波顿家的私生子，还有这些家伙，怎敢如此妄为！”罗德利克爵士瞧向布兰。“那小子还说了什么？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ser Rodrik frowned. "Well, should it happen that I need to ride against these raiders myself, I shan't take Alebelly, then. He didn't see me drowned, did he? No? Good." it heartened Bran to hear that. Maybe they won't drown, then, he thought. If they stay away from the sea.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="罗德利克爵士皱起眉头。“看来，如果我非得亲自出马去对付这群强盗不可，就让酒肚子留下好了。他没见我淹死吧，对吗？没有？好极了。”这话令布兰很振奋。或许他们不会被淹死了，他心想，不让他们靠近海就好。">查看中文翻译</div>
