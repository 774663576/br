<div class="line_en">On a seat cut in the stone beside a turn in the path they came upon Gandalf and Bilbo deep in talk. "Hullo! Good morning!" said Bilbo. "Feel ready for the great council?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"I feel ready for anything," answered Frodo. "But most of all I should like to go walking today and explore the valley. I should like to get into those pine-woods up there." He pointed away far up the side of Rivendell to the north.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我准备好可以面对任何挑战了，”佛罗多回答：“不过，我其实还是很想要四处散散步，看看那座山谷，想要去那边的松林看看。”他指着瑞文戴尔北边的山坡说道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Next day Frodo woke early, feeling refreshed and well. He walked along the terraces above the loud-flowing Bruinen and watched the pale, cool sun rise above the far mountains, and shine down. Slanting through the thin silver mist; the dew upon the yellow leaves was glimmering, and the woven nets of gossamer twinkled on every bush. Sam walked beside him, saying nothing. but sniffing the air, and looking every now and again with wonder in his eyes at the great heights in the East. The snow was white upon their peaks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天，佛罗多起了个大早，觉得神清气爽。他沿着喧闹的布鲁南河散步，看着苍白的太陽从远方的山脉后升起，驱散了单薄的银色雾气。黄色树叶上的露珠闪动着光芒，每株灌木丛上几乎都有着晶亮的蜘蛛网。山姆走在他身边，一言不发，只是嗅着清新的空气；偶尔会对东方高耸的山脉投以敬畏的目光，山顶依旧积雪封冻。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Elrond was there, and several others were seated in silence about him. Frodo saw Glorfindel and Gloin; and in a corner alone Strider was sitting, clad in his old travel-worn clothes again. Elrond drew Frodo to a seat by his side, and presented him to the company, saying:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱隆就在那里，还有其他几个人也跟着坐在他身边。佛罗多注意到葛罗芬戴尔和葛罗音，神行客又再度换回旅行用的破旧衣服，坐在角落。爱隆拉着佛罗多坐到他身边，并且向众人介绍他。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Gandalf led them to the porch where Frodo had found his friends the evening before. The light of the clear autumn morning was now glowing in the valley. The noise of bubbling waters came up from the foaming river-bed. Birds were singing, and a wholesome peace lay on the land. To Frodo his dangerous flight, and the rumours of the darkness growing in the world outside, already seemed only the memories of a troubled dream; but the faces that were turned to meet them as they entered were grave.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="甘道夫领着众人来到之前佛罗多和朋友们会面的门廊前。秋天清朗的晨光已经毫不吝惜地照在山谷中，潺潺的流水声、鸟儿的啁啾叫声和一股平和之气，充斥着大地。对佛罗多来说，之前的逃亡和外界黑暗扩张的传言，都变得如同恶梦初醒一般地模糊。只不过，他们一路上遇见的人，都显得脸色凝重。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“诸位，这位就是哈比人德罗哥之子，佛罗多。他所冒的危险和任务的急迫，是前所未见的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He then pointed out and named those whom Frodo had not met before. There was a younger dwarf at Gloin's side: his son Gimli. Beside Glorfindel there were several other counsellors of Elrond's household, of whom Erestor was the chief; and with him was Galdor, an Elf from the Grey Havens who had come on an errand from Cirdan the Shipwright. There was also a strange Elf clad in green and brown, Legolas, a messenger from his father, Thranduil, the King of the Elves of Northern Mirkwood. And seated a little apart was a tall man with a fair and noble face, dark-haired and grey-eyed, proud and stern of glance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他接着又对佛罗多介绍了他之前没有见过的人。葛罗音的身边有另一名比较年轻的矮人：他的儿子金雳。在葛罗芬戴尔旁边有几名爱隆麾下的长老，伊瑞斯特是长老们的领袖；他旁边边则是加尔多。他是名来自于灰港岸，受命于造船者瑟丹来此送信的精灵。另外还有一名全身穿着绿色和褐色衣服的陌生精灵勒苟拉斯，他是幽暗密林的精灵王瑟兰督伊之子，也是国王的信差。在距离大家都有一段距离的地方，还坐着一名高大的人类，他的五官英俊、透露着贵族的气息，表情十分严肃。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was cloaked and booted as if for a journey on horseback; and indeed though his garments were rich, and his cloak was lined with fur, they were stained with long travel. He had a collar of silver in which a single white stone was set; his locks were shorn about his shoulders. On a baldric he wore a great horn tipped with silver that now was laid upon his knees. He gazed at Frodo and Bilbo with sudden wonder.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的穿着看起来像是在马匹上赶路的旅人，衣料看起来却很高贵，斗篷的边缘还镶着毛皮。不过，再仔细一看，他身上的衣服也都沾满了旅途上的风霜白色的领口点缀着一枚宝石，头发则是及肩的长度。他身上挂着一条授带，底下则是一具尖端镶银的号角，此刻放在他的膝盖上。他看着比尔博和佛罗多，眼中猛然露出好奇的光芒。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Here," said Elrond, turning to Gandalf, "is Boromir, a man from the South. He arrived in the grey morning, and seeks for counsel. I have bidden him to be present, for here his questions will be answered."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这位，”爱隆转身对甘道夫说：“就是波罗莫，南方来的人类。他今天一早才刚到这里，想要寻求我们的协助：我特意邀请他过来，因为我们在这里将可以回答他的问题。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Not all that was spoken and debated in the Council need now be told. Much was said of events in the world outside, especially in the South, and in the wide lands east of the Mountains. Of these things Frodo had already heard many rumours; but the tale of Gloin was new to him, and when the dwarf spoke he listened attentively. It appeared that amid the splendour of their works of hand the hearts of the Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were troubled.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在这里，我们就不需要重述会议中争辩和讨论的内容了。许多的议题是和外面的世界有关，特别是南方，迷雾山脉东边的土地上的情势。有关这些地方，佛罗多已经听说了很多消息。但葛罗音所说的故事却是他所没有听过的。当他开口时，佛罗多无比专注地倾听着。看来，即使坐拥那么多伟大美丽的建筑，孤山地区的矮人依旧感到非常大的困扰。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It is now many years ago," said Gloin, "that a shadow of disquiet fell upon our people. Whence it came we did not at first perceive. Words began to be whispered in secret: it was said that we were hemmed in a narrow place, and that greater wealth and splendour would be found in a wider world. Some spoke of Moria: the mighty works of our fathers that are called in our own tongue Khazad-dum; and they declared that now at last we had the power and numbers to return."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“许多年以前，”葛罗音说：“我们的同胞开始起了騷动，我们不知道这是从什么时候开始的。人们开始低声交谈，说我们是龙困浅滩，外面的世界不只更宽阔，更有许多丰富的金银财宝。有些人提到了摩瑞亚，这是我们先祖们兴建的雄伟地下矿坑和都市，在我们的语言中被称为凯萨督姆。这些人宣称，我们终于有了足够的力量和数量可以回归到故乡去。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Then about a year ago a messenger came to Dain, but not from Moria -- from Mordor: a horseman in the night, who called Dain to his gate. The Lord Sauron the Great, so he said, wished for our friendship. Rings he would give for it, such as he gave of old. And he asked urgently concerning hobbits, of what kind they were, and where they dwelt. "For Sauron knows," said he, "that one of these was known to you on a time."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“然后，大概是一年之前，有一名信差来到丹恩驾前，但他并非来自摩瑞亚，而是魔多：夜半一名骑士前来丹恩的王宫前叫门。他说，索伦大君想要和我们建交，他愿意赐给我们拥有魔力的戒指，就如同古代一样。而他也十分着急地询问我们有关哈比人的消息；包括了他们是什么种族、居住在哪里等等。‘因为索伦大人知道，’他说：‘你们曾经和一名哈比人交往。’”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That was nigh on thirty years ago. For a while we had news and it seemed good: messages reported that Moria had been entered and a great work begun there. Then there was silence, and no word has ever come from Moria since.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这大概是三十年以前的事情了。有一段时间，我们听说了一些好消息。据说他们再度进入了摩瑞亚，开始新的庞大工程。然后，突然就音讯全无，一直到现在，再也没有传来任何相关的消息。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Gloin sighed. "Moria! Moria! Wonder of the Northern world! Too deep we delved there, and woke the nameless fear. Long have its vast mansions lain empty since the children of Durin fled. But now we spoke of it again with longing, and yet with dread; for no dwarf has dared to pass the doors of Khazad-dum for many lives of kings, save Thror only, and he perished. At last, however, Balin listened to the whispers, and resolved to go; and though Dain did not give leave willingly, he took with him Ori and Óin and many of our folk, and they went away south.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="葛罗音叹了口气。“摩瑞亚！摩瑞亚！北方王国的明钻！我们在那边挖得太深，唤醒了不知名的邪恶。自从都灵的子孙逃离该处之后，辉煌的殿堂就已经空虚很久了。但现在，我们又再度回忆起那美好的地方，却又同时唤醒了恐怖的回忆。自从索尔以来，凯萨督姆已经有数千年无人胆敢进入，因为连索尔都战死该处。最后，巴林在这流言的鼓动下，终于决定前往一探究竟。丹恩虽然不情愿让他走，但最后还是让他带着欧瑞和欧林，还有很多同胞一起往南走。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"At that his breath came like the hiss of snakes, and all who stood by shuddered, but Dain said: "I say neither yea nor nay. I must consider this message and what it means under its fair cloak."</div>

<div class="line_en">"At this we were greatly troubled, and we gave no answer. And then his fell voice was lowered, and he would have sweetened it if he could. "As a small token only of your friendship Sauron asks this," he said: "that you should find this thief," such was his word, "and get from him, willing or no, a little ring, the least of rings, that once he stole. It is but a trifle that Sauron fancies, and an earnest of your good will. Find it, and three rings that the Dwarf sires possessed of old shall be returned to you, and the realm of Moria shall be yours for ever. Find only news of the thief, whether he still lives and where, and you shall have great reward and lasting friendship from the Lord. Refuse, and things will not seem so well. Do you refuse?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“一听到这个消息，我们就觉得非常担心，因此没有回答他。然后，他那邪恶的声音变得低沉，甚至有些意图甜言蜜语的感觉。‘要赢取索伦大人的友谊，他只要求这件小事，’他说：‘你必须找到这名小偷，’底下就是他所说的话‘不管他愿不愿意，都必须从他身上拿到一枚微不足道的戒指，这就是他偷走的小东西。相较于索伦大人的善意，这实在是件小事，对你们来说也只是举手之劳。找到这枚戒指，我们就会把矮人祖先所拥有的三枚戒指还给你们，并且将摩瑞亚永世交由你们统治。你只需要找到那小偷的住所，打听他是否还活着，这就可以获得极大的奖赏和索伦大人的友谊。如果你们拒绝，一切恐怕就没有这么顺利了。你们觉得如何？’”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Heavy have the hearts of our chieftains been since that night. We needed not the fell voice of the messenger to warn us that his words held both menace and deceit; for we knew already that the power that has re-entered Mordor has not changed, and ever it betrayed us of old. Twice the messenger has returned, and has gone unanswered. The third and last time, so he says, is soon to come, before the ending of the year.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“从那晚之后，我们的酋长就变得忧心忡忡。我们不需要听那堕落的声音，就可以知道对方是个口蜜腹剑的家伙；因为我们已经知道重临魔多的力量并没有改过向善，他从以前就曾经出卖过矮人许多次。那信差回来了两次，但都没有获得答案，他表示，第三次也将会是最后一次，时间则是在今年年底。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You have done well to come," said Elrond. "You will hear today all that you need in order to understand the purposes of the Enemy. There is naught that you can do, other than to resist, with hope or without it. But you do not stand alone. You will learn that your trouble is but part of the trouble of all the western world.

<div class="line_en">"And so I have been sent at last by Dain to warn Bilbo that he is sought by the Enemy, and to learn, if may be, why he desires this ring, this least of rings. Also we crave the advice of Elrond. For the Shadow grows and draws nearer. We discover that messengers have come also to King Brand in Dale, and that he is afraid. We fear that he may yield. Already war is gathering on his eastern borders. If we make no answer, the Enemy may move Men of his rule to assail King Brand, and Dain also."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“因此，丹恩终于派出我来警告比尔博，让他知道魔王正在打听他的消息；如果可能的话，我还想要知道对方为什么会这么想要这枚微不足道的戒指。同时，我们也寻求爱隆的咨询，因为魔影已经越来越逼近我们的疆域。我们发现那信差也前往拜访谷地的国王布兰德，而他感到非常害怕，我们担心他会让步。布兰德东方的边境已经开始騷动，如果我们再不做出回答，魔王可能就会派出旗下的人类，来推翻布兰德和丹恩。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then all listened while Elrond in his clear voice spoke of Sauron and the Rings of Power, and their forging in the Second Age of the world long ago. A part of his tale was known to some there, but the full tale to none, and many eyes were turned t= Elrond in fear and wonder as he told of the Elven-smiths of Eregion and their friendship with Moria, and their eagerness for knowledge, by which Sauron ensnared them. For in that time he was not yet evil to behold, and they received his aid and grew mighty in craft, whereas he learned all their secrets, and betrayed them, and forged secretly in the Mountain of Fire the One Ring to be their master. But Celebrimbor was aware of him, and hid the Three which he had made; and there was war, and the land was laid waste, and the gate of Moria was shut.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所有人都听着爱隆用清朗的声音，描述索伦和权能之戒间的牵扯，以及它们是如何在第二纪元中被铸造出来的过程，在场有些人已经知道了部分的故事，但没人知道整个故事的全貌。当他提到伊瑞詹的精灵铁匠和摩瑞亚之间的友谊，以及他们求知若渴的态度反遭索伦利用时，许多人用着恐惧和惊讶的眼神看着爱隆，因为当时，世间还不知道索伦的邪恶本质，因此欣然接受他的协助。在他们的力量逐渐增加的同时，索伦也学到了所有的秘密；接着他出卖了他们，悄悄地在火山中铸造了统御众戒的至尊魔戒，但赛勒布理鹏即时发现了他的陰谋，将他所打造的三枚戒指隐藏起来；接着就掀起了战争，一时之间大地被战火所蹂躏，摩瑞亚的大门也从此封闭。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Of Numenor he spoke, its glory and its fall, and the return of the Kings of Men to Middle-earth out of the deeps of the Sea, borne upon the wings of storm. Then Elendil the Tall and his mighty sons, Isildur and Anarion, became great lords; and the North-realm they made in Arnor, and the South-realm in Gondor above the mouths of Anduin. But Sauron of Mordor assailed them, and they made the Last Alliance of Elves and Men, and the hosts of Gil-galad and Elendil were mustered in Arnor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他也提到了努曼诺尔的辉煌和崩溃，以及人皇越过深邃的大海，乘着暴风的翅膀回到中土世界的历史。伟人伊兰迪尔和他的两名儿子埃西铎和安那瑞安都成了史上著名的明君；他们在亚尔诺创建北方王国，在安都因河口的刚铎创建南方王国。但魔多的索伦起兵攻打他们，伊兰迪尔和吉尔加拉德筹组了人类和精灵的最后联盟，大军齐聚亚尔诺。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Thereupon Elrond paused a while and sighed. "I remember well the splendour of their banners," he said. "It recalled to me the glory of the Elder Days and the hosts of Beleriand, so many great princes and captains were assembled.

I beheld the last combat on the slopes of Orodruin, where Gil-galad died, and Elendil fell, and Narsil broke beneath him; but Sauron himself was overthrown, and Isildur cut the Ring from his hand with the hilt-shard of his father's sword, and took it for his own."</div>

I deem it to be a tongue of the Black Land, since it is foul and uncouth. What evil it saith I do not know; but I trace here a copy of it, lest it fade beyond recall.

I, too, despaired at last, and I began my homeward journey. And then, by fortune, I came suddenly on what I sought: the marks of soft feet beside a muddy pool. But now the trail was fresh and swift, and it led not to Mordor but away. Along the skirts of the Dead Marshes I followed it, and then I had him. Lurking by a stagnant mere, peering in the water as the dark eve fell, I caught him, Gollum. He was covered with green slime. He will never love me, I fear; for he bit me, and I was not gentle. Nothing more did I ever get from his mouth than the marks of his teeth. I deemed it the worst part of all my journey, the road back, watching him day and night, making him walk before me with a halter on his neck, gagged, until he was tamed by lack of drink and food, driving him ever towards Mirkwood. I brought him there at last and gave him to the Elves, for we had agreed that this should be done; and I was glad to be rid of his company, for he stank.

<div class="line_en">"At the end of June I was in the Shire, but a cloud of anxiety was on my mind, and I rode to the southern borders of the little land; for I had a foreboding of some danger, still hidden from me but drawing near. There messages reached me telling me of war and defeat in Gondor, and when I heard of the Black Shadow a chill smote my heart. But I found nothing save a few fugitives from the South; yet it seemed to me that on them sat a fear of which they would not speak. I turned then east and north and journeyed along the Greenway; and not far from Bree I came upon a traveller sitting on a bank beside the road with his grazing horse beside him. It was Radagast the Brown, who at one time dwelt at Rhosgobel, near the borders of Mirkwood. He is one of my order, but I had not seen him for many a year.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“到了六月底的时候，我人已经到了夏尔；但心中有些不安和焦虑，我骑着马到达那块土地的南方边界。因为我有种邪恶的预感，彷佛有什么灾难躲过了我的眼睛，却继续朝我靠近。我所收到的情报包括了刚铎的战斗和失败，当我听到魔影再生的消息时，我不禁感到脊背生寒。可是，我在那边只有遇到几名从南方逃出的难民。虽然他们什么都不说，但在我看来，他们似乎有什么难言之隐。我又继续沿着夏尔的东方和北方行走，最后沿着绿大道赶路。我在距离布理不远的地方遇到了一名坐在路边的旅人；他的马匹在他身边安静地吃着草。那是褐袍瑞达加斯特，他曾经居住在罗斯加堡，亦即是靠近幽暗密林的地方。他是吾辈之一，但我已经有许多年没遇过他了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

This tale I must tell in full, for only Elrond has heard it yet, and that in brief, but it will bear on all that we must resolve. It is the last Chapter in the Tale of the Ring, so far as it has yet gone.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“就是这个夏尔，”说，一颗心直往下沉。因为当九戒灵听命于堕落的首领时，连贤者都害怕当面对抗他们。他过去是个伟大的法师兼国王，人们现在对他的感觉只剩下要命的恐惧。“谁告诉你的，又是谁派你来的？”我问道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Saruman the White," answered Radagast. "And he told me to say that if you feel the need, he will help; but you must seek his aid at once, or it will be too late."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“白袍萨鲁曼，”瑞达加斯特回答：“他还告诉我，如果你觉得有需要，他愿意伸出援手，但你必须马上去找他帮忙，否则一切都太迟了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"And that message brought me hope. For Saruman the White is the greatest of my order. Radagast is, of course, a worthy Wizard, a master of shapes and changes of hue; and he has much lore of herbs and beasts, and birds are especially his friends. But Saruman has long studied the arts of the Enemy himself, and thus we have often been able to forestall him. It was by the devices of Saruman that we drove him from Dol Guldur. It might be that he had found some weapons that would drive back the Nine.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这个消息让我重新燃起了希望，因为白袍萨鲁曼是我辈中最伟大的巫师。当然，瑞达加斯特也是个不错的巫师，他擅长变色和变形，对于药草非常有知识，飞禽走兽都是他的朋友。萨鲁曼则是精研魔王的历史，才能让我们预先料到他的一举一动。我们是靠着萨鲁曼的计谋，才能够将魔王赶出多尔哥多，或许他已经找到了对付九戒灵的武器。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Then you must go now," said Radagast; "for I have wasted time in looking for you, and the days are running short. I was told to find you before Midsummer, and that is now here. Even if you set out from this spot, you will hardly reach him before the Nine discover the land that they seek. I myself shall turn back at once." And with that he mounted and would have ridden straight off.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那你最好赶快去，”瑞达加斯特说：“我为了找到你，浪费了不少时间。他告诉我必须在夏至之前找到你，现在就已经是夏至了。即使你立刻出发，也很难在九戒灵找到他们的目标之前抵达，我必须立刻赶回去。”话一说完，他就骑上马，准备立刻离开。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"However, I wrote a message to Frodo, and trusted to my friend the innkeeper to send it to him. I rode away at dawn; and I came at long last to the dwelling of Saruman. That is far south in Isengard, in the end of the Misty Mountains, not far from the Gap of Rohan. And Boromir will tell you that that is a great open vale that lies between the Misty Mountains and the northmost foothills of Ered Nimrais, the White Mountains of his home. But Isengard is a circle of sheer rocks that enclose a valley as with a wall, and in the midst of that valley is a tower of stone called Orthanc. It was not made by Saruman, but by the Men of Numenor long ago; and it is very tall and has many secrets; yet it looks not to be a work of craft. It cannot be reached save by passing the circle of Isengard; and in that circle there is only one gate."</div>

Wolves and orcs were housed in Isengard, for Saruman was mustering a great force on his own account, in rivalry of Sauron and not in his service yet. Over all his works a dark smoke hung and wrapped itself about the sides of Orthanc. I stood alone on an island in the clouds; and I had no chance of escape, and my days were bitter.

<div class="line_en">"That the Nine had indeed arisen I felt assured, apart from the words of Saruman which might be lies. Long ere I came to Isengard I had heard tidings by the way that could not be mistaken. Fear was ever in my heart for my friends in the Shire; but still I had some hope. I hoped that Frodo had set forth at once, as my letter had urged, and that he had reached Rivendell before the deadly pursuit began. And both my fear and my hope proved ill-founded. For my hope was founded on a fat man in Bree; and my fear was founded on the cunning of Sauron. But fat men who sell ale have many calls to answer; and the power of Sauron is still less than fear makes it. But in the circle of Isengard, trapped and alone, it was not easy to think that the hunters before whom all have fled or fallen would falter in the Shire far away."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“即使萨鲁曼其他的说法都是谎言，我也能够确定九戒灵确实复苏了。在前往艾辛格之前，我就已经从可靠的管道获得了确实的消息。我开始替夏尔的朋友担忧，但心中依旧暗存一丝希望。因为，如果佛罗多照着信件的内容，立刻出发，他应该会在黑骑士之前抵达瑞文戴尔。我的恐惧和希望却都意外落空了，因为，我的希望关键在于布理的一名胖老板身上，而我的恐惧则是奠基于索伦已经彻底恢复力量的假设上。卖酒的胖老板有许多事情要忙，而索伦的力量也没有完全恢复。但是，当我被孤单地困在艾辛格时，我实在很难想像曾经横扫世界的黑骑士竟然在遥远的夏尔遇上了阻碍。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"At first I feared, as Saruman no doubt intended, that Radagast had also fallen. Yet I had caught no hint of anything wrong in his voice or in his eye at our meeting. If I had, I should never have gone to Isengard, or I should have gone more warily. So Saruman guessed, and he had concealed his mind and deceived his messenger. It would have been useless in any case to try and win over the honest Radagast to treachery. He sought me in good faith, and so persuaded me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“一开始我十分害怕，萨鲁曼既然已经堕落了，瑞达加斯特多半也和他同流合污。但是，我在和他会面的时候并没有发现他有什么异样，如果当时有任何的异状，我绝对不会到艾辛格来自投罗网，或者我至少会小心提防。因此，萨鲁曼猜到我的反应，他刻意隐瞒这信差真正的目的，没有任何人可以说服诚实的瑞达加斯特欺骗任何人。他诚心诚意地告诉我这件事，因此才能说服我。”">查看中文翻译</div>

By day his coat glistens like silver; and by night it is like a shade, and he passes unseen. Light is his footfall!

<div class="line_en">"Worst is a bad word," I said to him, "and I hope you do not live to see it." But amidst his talk I gathered at last that Frodo had left Hobbiton less than a week before, and that a black horseman had come to the Hill the same evening. Then I rode on in fear. I came to Buckland and found it in uproar, as busy as a hive of ants that has been stirred with a stick. I came to the house at Crickhollow, and it was broken open and empty; but on the threshold there lay a cloak that had been Frodo's. Then for a while hope left me, and I did not wait to gather news, or I might have been comforted; but I rode on the trail of the Riders. It was hard to follow, for it went many ways, and I was at a loss. But it seemed to me that one or two had ridden towards Bree; and that way I went, for I thought of words that might be said to the innkeeper.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“最糟糕这个字最好不要常用，”我对他说：“我希望你这辈子都不会看到所谓的最糟糕到底是什么样子。”不过，我还是从他的闲聊之中打探出来，佛罗多不到一周前离开了哈比屯，黑骑士就在同一天傍晚来到他所住的小丘。我心内充满恐惧地继续赶路。我来到雄鹿地，发现当地兵荒马乱，彷佛是被打翻的蜂巢或是蚁窝一样。我来到了溪谷地的小屋，那里有被强行闯入的痕迹，已经一个人也不剩，可是，在门口却有一件佛罗多穿的斗篷。有很长的一段时间，我感到彻底地绝望，心灰意冷之下，我根本懒得打听消息，直接离开了溪谷地。如果我当时再冷静一些，或许会知道让我安心的好消息，但我当时一心只想着跟踪那些黑骑士，那对当时的我来说是非常困难的一件事情；他们的蹄印分散开来，而我又觉得心慌意乱，平静不下来。在我仔细地观察之后，勉强发现有一两道痕迹是指向布理的，所以，我觉得该去找旅店老板谈谈。">查看中文翻译</div>

Time was when a squirrel could go from tree to tree from what is now the Shire to Dunland west of Isengard. In those lands I journeyed once, and many things wild and strange I knew. But I had forgotten Bombadil, if indeed this is still the same that walked the woods and hills long ago, and even then was older than the old. That was not then his name. Iarwain Ben-adar we called him, oldest and fatherless. But many another name he has since been given by other folk: Forn by the Dwarves, Orald by Northern Men, and other names beside. He is a strange creature, but maybe I should have summoned him to our Council."</div>

<div class="line_en">"But in any case," said Glorfindel, "to send the Ring to him would only postpone the day of evil. He is far away. We could not now take it back to him, unguessed, unmarked by any spy. And even if we could, soon or late the Lord of the Rings would learn of its hiding place and would bend all his power towards it.

Its strength, Boromir, is too great for anyone to wield at will, save only those who have already a great power of their own. But for them it holds an even deadlier peril. The very desire of it corrupts the heart. Consider Saruman. If any of the Wise should with this Ring overthrow the Lord of Mordor, using his own arts, he would then set himself on Sauron's throne, and yet another Dark Lord would appear. And that is another reason why the Ring should be destroyed: as long as it is in the world it will be a danger even to the Wise. For nothing is evil in the beginning. Even Sauron was not so. I fear to take the Ring to hide it. I will not take the Ring to wield it."</div>

Those who made them did not desire strength or domination or hoarded wealth, but understanding, making, and healing, to preserve all things unstained. These things the Elves of Middle-earth have in some measure gained, though with sorrow.

<div class="line_en">"Very well, very well, Master Elrond!" said Bilbo suddenly. "Say no more! It is plain enough what you are pointing at. Bilbo the silly hobbit started this affair, and Bilbo had better finish it, or himself. I was very comfortable here, and getting on with my book. If you want to know, I am just writing an ending for it. I had thought of putting: and he lived happily ever afterwards to the end of his days. It is a good ending, and none the worse for having been used before. Now I shall have to alter that: it does not look like coming true; and anyway there will evidently have to be several more Chapters, if I live to write them. It is a frightful nuisance. When ought I to start?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“说得好，说得好，爱隆大人！”比尔博突然说：“不要多说了！我已经明白你的意思了。比尔博是开始这一切的愚蠢哈比人，自然应该由比尔博来结束这一切，或是结束他自己的愚行。我在这里过得很舒服，书也写得很顺利。如果你们有兴趣的话，我的书也快写完了。我本来想要在最后加上：他从此过着幸福快乐的日子。这个结局很不错，即使之前有很多人用过也无损它的杰出。看来，这恐怕不能成真了，我得修改结局才行。如果我能够活着写下它们的话，看来我还有好几个章节可以写呢！这可真让人放心不下。我们什么时候离开？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"At least for a while," said Elrond. "The road must be trod, but it will be very hard. And neither strength nor wisdom will carry us far upon it. This quest may be attempted by the weak with as much hope as the strong. Yet such is oft the course of deeds that move the wheels of the world: small hands do them because they must, while the eyes of the great are elsewhere."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“至少目前是这样，”爱隆说：“即使它险阻重重，我们也必须走上这条道路，不管是再多的力量或是智慧，都不足以帮助我们度过难关。这次的任务，弱者可能和强者拥有一样的机会。但这不就是天地万物之理吗？弱小者为生命而搏斗，刚强者却大意将头转向他方。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Boromir looked in surprise at Bilbo, but the laughter died on his lips when he saw that all the others regarded the old hobbit with grave respect. Only Gloin smiled, but his smile came from old memories.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Of course, my dear Bilbo," said Gandalf. "If you had really started this affair, you might be expected to finish it. But you know well enough now that starting is too great a claim for any, and that only a small part is played in great deeds by any hero. You need not bow! Though the word was meant, and we do not doubt that under jest you are making a valiant offer. But one beyond your strength, Bilbo. You cannot take this thing back. It has passed on. If you need my advice any longer, I should say that your part is ended, unless as a recorder. Finish your book, and leave the ending unaltered! There is still hope for it. But get ready to write a sequel, when they come back."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“当然，亲爱的比尔博，”甘道夫说：“如果这一切真的是由你开始的，自然该由你结束它。但你太了解没有人可以说这事情是他开始，任何的英雄在历史中其实都只扮演一小部分的角色。你不需要跟我们敬礼！我们知道你是真心的，也不怀疑你的勇气。但是，比尔博，有件事情你必须明白，你不能够把这样东西送回去，魔戒已经不属于你的了。如果你还需要我的忠告，我会告诉你，你的主戏已经演完了，你必须扮演好记录者的角色，尽管写完你的书，不需要更改结局！我们还有希望的。不过，他们回来的时候，请记得替他们写本续集。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Bilbo laughed. "I have never known you give me pleasant advice before." he said. "As all your unpleasant advice has been good, I wonder if this advice is not bad. Still, I don't suppose I have the strength or luck left to deal with the Ring. It has grown, and I have not. But tell me: what do you mean by they?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="比尔博笑了。“你以前的忠告从来没这么好听过，”他说：“既然你所有逆耳的忠言都是为了我好，那我想这次应该也不坏。我的确不认为自己拥有足够的力量和运气来对付魔戒。它成长了，但我没有。可是，我不明白，你口中的他们是谁？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Exactly! And who are they to be? That seems to me what this Council has to decide, and all that it has to decide. Elves may thrive on speech alone, and Dwarves endure great weariness; but I am only an old hobbit, and I miss my meal at noon. Can't you think of some names now?

<div class="line_en">No one answered. The noon-bell rang. Still no one spoke. Frodo glanced at all the faces, but they were not turned to him. All the Council sat with downcast eyes, as if in deep thought. A great dread fell on him, as if he was awaiting the pronouncement of some doom that he had long foreseen and vainly hoped might after all never be spoken. An overwhelming longing to rest and remain at peace by Bilbo's side in Rivendell filled all his heart. At last with an effort he spoke, and wondered to hear his own words, as if some other will was using his small voice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没有人回答。正午的铃声响了，依旧没人说话。佛罗多看着所有人，但没有人看着他，会议现场的每个人都低下头，彷佛在努力地沉思着。他觉得心头沉重，彷佛自己在等待着死刑的宣判，却又暗自希望永远不要听到结局。他心中只想要永远地待在比尔博身边，在瑞文戴尔好好享受平静的气氛。最后，他十分勉强地开口，自己也怀疑究竟能不能听到口中发出的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>

This is the hour of the Shire-folk, when they arise from their quiet fields to shake the towers and counsels of the Great. Who of all the Wise could have foreseen it?
