<div class="line_en">Rich dad sat quietly, letting his words sink in. Mike and I heard what he said, but really did not understand fully what he was talking about. I just knew that I often wondered why grownups hurried off to work. It did not seem like much fun, and they never looked that happy, but something kept them hurrying off to work.</div>

<div class="line_en">Realizing we had absorbed as much as possible of what he was talking about, rich dad said, "I want you boys to avoid that trap. That is really what I want to teach you. Not just to be rich, because being rich does not solve the problem."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“不能吗？”我惊奇地问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No, it doesn't. Let me finish the other emotion, which is desire. Some call it greed, but I prefer desire. It is perfectly normal to desire something better, prettier, more fun or exciting. So people also work for money because of desire. They desire money for the joy they think it can buy. But the joy that money brings is often short lived, and they soon need more money for more joy, more pleasure, more comfort, more security. So they keep working, thinking money will soothe their souls that is troubled by fear and desire. But money cannot do that."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不能。让我谈谈另一种感情：欲望，有人把它称为贪婪，但我宁可用欲望。希望一些东西更好、更漂亮、更有趣或更令人激动，这是相当正常的。所以人们总为了实现欲望而最终变成是为钱工作。他们认为钱能买来快乐，可用钱买来的快乐往往是短暂的，所以他们不久就需要更多的钱来买更多的快乐、更多的开心、更多的舒适和更多的安全。于是他们工作又工作，以为钱能使他们那被恐惧和欲望折磨着的灵魂平静下来，但实际上钱无法满足他们的欲望。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Rich people included," said rich dad. "In fact, the reason many rich people are rich is not because of desire but because of fear. They actually think that money can eliminate that fear of not having money, of being poor, so they amass tons of it only tofind out the fear gets worse. They now fear losing it. I have friends who keep working even though they have plenty. I know people who have millions who are more afraid now than when they were poor. They're terrified of losing all their money. The fears that drove them to get rich got worse. That weak and needy part of their soul is actually screaming louder. They don't want to lose the big houses, the cars, the high life that money has bought them. They worry about what their friends would say if they lost all their money. Many are emotionally desperate and neurotic, although they look rich and have more money."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“富人也是如此。事实上，许多人致富并非出于欲望而是由于恐惧，他们认为钱能消除那种没有钱、贫困的恐惧，所以他们积累了很多的钱，可是他们发现恐惧感更加强烈了，他们更加害怕失去钱。我有一些朋友，已经很有钱了，但还在拼命工作，甚至有些百万富翁比他们穷困时还要恐惧。这种恐惧使他们过得很糟糕，他们精神中虚弱贫乏的一面总是在大声尖叫：我不想失去房子、车子和钱给我带来的上等生活。他们甚至担心一旦没钱了，朋友们会怎么说。许多人变得绝望而神经质，尽管他们很富有。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As if on cue, the town derelict went past our table, stopping by the large rubbish can and rummaging around in it. The three of us watched him with great interest, when before we probably would have just ignored him.</div>

<div class="line_en">Rich dad pulled a dollar out of his wallet and gestured to the older man. Seeing the money, the derelict came over immediately, took the bill, thanked rich dad profusely and hurried off ecstatic with his good fortune.</div>

<div class="line_en">"He's not much different from most of my employees," said rich dad. "I've met so many people who say, `Oh, I'm not interested in money.' Yet they'll work at a job for eight hours a day. That's a denial of truth. If they weren't interested in money, then why are they working? That kind of thinking is probably more psychotic than a person who hoards money."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他与我的大多数雇员并没有太大差别，”富爸爸说，“我遇到过很多人，他们说‘我对钱没兴趣’，可他们却一天工作8小时并不停地抱怨工作无聊。如果他们对钱没兴趣，又何必干自己不喜欢的工作呢？这种人比敛财的人病得更重。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No, that would be a waste of time," said rich dad. "Emotions are what make us human. Make us real. The word `emotion' stands for energy in motion. Be truthful about your emotions, and use your mind and emotions in your favor, not against yourself."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那只会浪费时间。人需要有感情，它使我们真实，感情这个词表达着行动的动力。真实地看待你的感情，以你喜欢的方式运用你的头脑和感情，而不是与自己作对。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“那我们该怎么办？”我问，“不为钱工作直到所有的恐惧和贪婪都消失吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Sure," replied rich dad. "When a person says, `I need to find a job,' it's most likely an emotion doing the thinking. Fear of not having money generates that thought."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可以。当一个人说‘我得去找份工作’，这就很可能是感情代替了思考。害怕没钱的感觉便产生了找工作的念头。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Don't worry about what I just said. It will make more sense in years to come. just be an observer, not a reactor, to your emotions. Most people do not know that it's their emotions that are doing the thinking. Your emotions are your emotions, but you have got to learn to do your own thinking."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“但我爸总是说‘去上学，取得好成绩，这样你就能找到稳定的工作’”，我有些迷惑地说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"For example," said rich dad. "If the fear of not having enough money arises, instead of immediately running out to get a job so they can earn a few bucks to kill the fear, they instead might ask themselves this question. `Will a job be the best solution to this fear over the long run?' In my opinion, the answer is `no.' Especially when you look over a person's lifetime. A job is really a short-term solution to a long-term problem."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“比如说吧，如果人们害怕没有钱花，就立刻去找工作，然后挣到了钱，使恐惧感消除。这样做似乎很对。可一旦这样理解，他就不会去思考这样一个问题，一份工作能长期解决你的经济问题吗？依我看，答案是‘不能’，尤其从人的一生来看更是如此。工作只是试图用暂时的办法来解决长期的问题。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“是啊，我懂他的意思。大多数人都这么给人建议，而且对于大多数人来说这也确实是个好主意。但人们作出这种建议基本上仍是出于恐惧。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes," said rich dad. "He's terrified that you won't be able to earn money and won't fit into society. Don't get me wrong. He loves you and wants the best for you. And I think his fear is justified. An education and a job are important. But it won't handle the fear. You see, that same fear that makes him get up in the morning to earn a few bucks is the fear that is causing him to be so fanatical about you going to school."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，他担心你将来挣不到钱并且不适应这个社会。别误解了我的话，他爱你而且希望你好，而且他的担心也不无道理。教育和工作是很重要的，可它们对付不了恐惧。实际上，他恐惧，所以每天去上班挣钱；为作担心，所以热衷于让你去上学。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"The main cause of poverty or financial struggle is fear and ignorance, not the economy or the government or the rich. It's selfinflicted fear and ignorance that keeps people trapped. So you boys go to school and get your college degrees. I'll teach you how to stay out of the trap."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“造成贫穷和财务问题的主要原因是恐惧和无知，而非经济环境、政府或富人。自身的恐惧和无知使人们难以自拔，所以你们应该去上学并且接受大学教育，而我教你们怎样不落入馅阱。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The pieces of the puzzle were appearing. My highly educated dad had a great education and a great career. But school never told him how to handle money or his fears. It became clear that I could learn different and important things from two fathers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="谜底渐渐显露出来。我爸爸受过高等教育，有着很好的职业，但学校从不告诉他如何处理金钱或恐惧。我可以从两个爸爸那里学习不同的但同样都是很重要的事情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"So you've been talking about the fear of not having money. How does the desire of money affect our thinking?" Mike asked.</div>

<div class="line_en">"By not giving in to your emotions, you were able to delay your reactions and think. That is most important. We will always have emotions of fear and greed. From here on in, it is most important for you to use those emotions to your advantage and for the long term, and not simply let your emotions run you by controlling your thinking. Most people use fear and greed against themselves. That's the start of ignorance. Most people live their lives chasing paychecks, pay raises and job security because of the emotions of desire and fear, not really questioning where those emotion-driven thoughts are leading them. It's just like the picture of a donkey, dragging a cart, with its owner dangling a carrot just in front of the donkey's nose. The donkey's owner may be going where he wants to go, but the donkey is chasing an illusion. Tomorrow there will only be another carrot for the donkey."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“但你们没有对感觉屈服，你们推迟了决定的作出。这是极为重要的。我们总是有着恐惧或贪婪之心。从现在开始，对你们来说，重要的是运用这些感情为你们的长期利益谋利，别让你们的感情控制了思想。大多数人让他们的恐惧和贪婪之心来支配自己，这是无知的开始。因为害怕或贪婪，大多数人生活在挣工资、加薪、劳动保护之中，而不问这种感情支配思想的生活之路通向哪里。这就像一幅画：驴子在拼命拉车，因为车夫在它鼻子前面放了个胡萝卜。车夫知道该把车驶到哪里，而驴却只是在追逐一个幻觉。但第二天驴依旧会去拉车，因为又有胡萝卜放在了驴子的面前。”">查看中文翻译</div>

I want you always to think of the donkey. Never forget, because your two emotions, fear and desire, can lead you into life's biggest trap, if you're not aware of them controlling your thinking. To spend your life living in fear, never exploring your dreams, is cruel. To work hard for money, thinking that money will buy you things that will make you happy is also cruel. To wake up in the middle of the night terrified about paying bills is a horrible way to live. To live a life dictated by the size of a paycheck is not really a life. Thinking that a job will make you feel secure is lying to yourself. That's cruel, and that's the trap I want you to avoid, if possible. I've seen how money runs people's lives. Don't let that happen to you. Please don't let money run your life."</div>
