<div class="line_en">I had to get an invitation from the Bureau of Education in Nanning, capital of Guangxi Province in order to accept an offer from the Hechi Teachers' College, Yishan County, Guangxi Province. Why? Because Yishan County was closed to foreign visitors due to a lack of adequate tourist facilities. The name of the county was changed a couple of years ago to Yizhou and thrown open to outside, but things were different back in 1988.</div>

<div class="line_en">I had quite a journey before I reached the College. I flew to Guangzhou via Bangkok and Hong Kong where I was met by Mr. Ye, a foreign affairs official from the Guangzhou University of Foreign Languages. He gave me the VIP treatment. I was soon to experience as a "foreign expert" in the People's Republic.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在我到达学院之前，我经历了相当长的一段旅程。我飞往广州途经曼谷和香港，在那里我遇到了叶先生，他是广州外国语大学的外事官员。他给了我贵宾卡处理方法。我很快在中华人民共和国担任“外国专家”。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After breakfast I had a marvelous experience: a visit to the Flower Market in Guangzhou, part of the Spring Festival when Chinese celebrate their New Year. The whole of the city's central area was closed to traffic and transformed into a gigantic mall. This arrangement enabled innumerable citizens and visitors to wander through row after row of stalls filled with exotic flowers, small trees, fish and birds offered for sale by peasants from the rural regions of Guangdong Province.</div>

<div class="line_en">After a few days of these simple, yet unique pleasures, and in spite of the wonderful hospitality, I yearned to reach the destination where I was to live and work in the large county of Yishan. The thought of being the only foreigner in this county of over half a million Chinese excited me and I wanted to get on with it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在这些简单而独特的快乐中度过了几天之后，尽管受到了盛情款待，我还是渴望到达目的地，在伊山这个大县里生活和工作。想到自己是这里唯一的外国人，这个拥有50多万中国人口的县让我感到兴奋，我想继续下去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For another two days I wandered around the University campus and climbed Baiyun Mountain on the top of which is a fascinating lake. The scene was something from a delicately Chinese greetings card. At the other end of the lake was a restaurant of Chinese architectural design and along the shore to the right I saw small colored canoes fluctuated side by side waiting for someone to hire them. Time, unfortunately, prevented me from the pleasure of rowing out into the middle of the lake and enjoying the tranquil circumstance from that vantage point.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在接下来的两天里，我在大学校园里闲逛，爬上了BaiyunMountain，其顶部是一个迷人的湖泊。这个场景来自一张精致的中国贺卡。在湖的另一端是一家中国建筑设计的餐馆，沿着右岸我看到五颜六色的小独木舟并排起伏，等待着有人来雇用他们。不幸的是，时间阻碍了我划船到湖中央，从那个有利位置享受宁静环境的乐趣。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On the way into the city in a bus with Mr. Ye, his wife and a party of foreign experts from the U. S.

<div class="line_en">My first experience of a well-established Chinese custom came the evening after my arrival at Hechi Teachers' College. I had been installed in my spacious, self-contained apartment -- a privilege for a single person -- and now it was time for my welcoming banquet. Because a "foreign expert" is regarded as a VIP (at least in that remote part of China), the banquet was hosted by the sincere College president, and attended by three vice-presidents, several senior teaching and administrative staff, some local officers (including the deputy mayor and the county's Head of Security) and the driver of the car which had transported me from Liuzhou to Yishan.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was jolly affair with welcoming preliminary remarks and a convivial atmosphere.

<div class="line_en">Once I began teaching, I realized the size of the College. The English Department had nearly two hundred students and, in those days, was one of six departments offering courses to about a thousand students. There were two hundred teaching staff. The students came from all over Hechi, a remote mountainous area composed of several counties with a population of nearly five million people.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一旦我开始教书，我就意识到了学院的规模。当时，英语系有近200名学生，是为大约1000名学生提供课程的六个系之一。有200名教师。这些学生来自河池各地，这是一个由几个县组成的偏远山区，人口接近500万。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Most of the students enrolled belong to one or other of the fifty-five minority nationalities that make up the truly multi-cultural nation of China.

<div class="line_en">Another bonus for me was that my students lived, worked and played on the College campus. I was, therefore, able to assist their learning during most of my waking hours because I lived, worked and played with them. This was quite a contrast to my situation at Curtin University of Technology in Western Australia where my main contact with students was during official lesson periods.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对我来说，另一个好处是，我的学生们在大学校园里生活、工作、玩耍。因此，在我醒着的大部分时间里，我能够帮助他们学习，因为我和他们一起生活、工作、玩耍。这与我在西澳大利亚州理工大学的情况形成了鲜明的对比，在那里我与学生的主要接触是在正式授课期间。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Being the only foreigner on campus, I had quite a lot of attention from what I called "staring squads" both at the College and in the little town of Yishan, which was located in the bosom of the mountains. After a month or so, however, everyone had become accustomed to my face as I walked through the town or the College grounds; and so my walks were then usually punctuated with friendly "hellos" from all, including the delightful children from the kindergarten opposite my apartment block.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="作为校园里唯一的外国人，我在学院和位于山脉腹地的小镇宜山受到了我所谓的“凝视小队”的很多关注。然而，大约一个月后，当我穿过城镇或学院时，每个人都已经习惯了我的脸；因此，我的散步时常被所有人友好的“问候”打断，包括我公寓对面幼儿园的可爱的孩子们。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On one of these walks I met with a Chinese custom, which slightly puzzled me at first. On my daily walks to the town area for shopping I would pass many residences. In summer, many of the occupants would leave their front doors open because of the heat and sit in the front room eating their meals. As I passed by they would call out friendly greetings to me and, lifting their bowls towards me, indicate that they were inviting me to join them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在其中的一次散步中，我遇到了一个中国习俗，起初这个习俗让我有点困惑。在我每天步行到市区购物的时候，我会经过许多住宅区。在夏天，许多居住者会因为天气炎热而敞开前门，坐在前屋吃饭。当我经过时，他们会向我友好地打招呼，并向我举起他们的碗，表示他们邀请我加入他们。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Many of the students, the town people and, certainly, the rural peasants had never before set eyes on a foreigner. After a time, though, they all got used to me. the "staring squads" diminished in number and finally dwindled to the occasional small circle. As a result I constantly got invitations to banquets within the College and in the homes of town residents and teachers from other educational faculties.</div>

<div class="line_en">At first I had no notion of what this meant, and didn't know how to respond. However, I learnt from my students that the gestures were merely symbolic and traditional and that I was not expected to accept.
