<div class="line_en">The first time she was alone with Waddington she brought the conversation round to Charlie. Waddington had spoken of him on the evening of their arrival. She pretended that he was no more than an acquaintance of her husband.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当她第一次有机会和韦丁顿单独聊天时，她有意把话题引向了查理。他们到达此地的那个晚上韦丁顿曾经提起过他。她装作与查理并不谙识，称他只是丈夫的一位熟人罢了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I never cared much for him," said Waddington. "I've always thought him a bore."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我对他不怎么留意。”韦丁顿说道，“他嘛，我觉得他很招人厌烦。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I know. That is his stock in trade. He's made a science of popularity. He has the gift of making every one he meets feel that he is the one person in the world he wants to see. He's always ready to do a service that isn't any trouble to himself, and even if he doesn't do what you want he manages to give you the impression that it's only because it's not humanly possible."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这个我知道。那就是他苦心经营的事业。他深谙笼络人心之道。他有种天赋，让每个遇到他的人都觉得跟他情投意合。对他来说不在话下的事，他总是乐得为你效劳；要是你之所愿稍微难为了他，他也会让你觉得换了谁也是做不来的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Charm and nothing but charm at last grows a little tiresome, I think. It's a relief then to deal with a man who isn't quite so delightful but a little more sincere. I've known Charlie Townsend for a good many years and once or twice I've caught him with the mask off -- you see, I never mattered, just a subordinate official in the Customs -- and I know that he doesn't in his heart give a damn for any one in the world but himself."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“魅力，自始至终一成不变的魅力会使人厌烦，我个人认为。当你跟一个并非殷勤而是严肃的人交往时，就会感到相当舒坦。我认识唐生有好多年了，有那么一两次，我看到他摘下了他那张面具。不过我不关心他这个的，我就是普普通通一个海关低级官员。据我了解，在这个世界上他不会向任何人付出什么东西，除了他自己。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You must be very hard to please," returned Kitty, in the bright, chaffing way she could assume so easily. "I suppose he's far and away the most popular man in Hong Kong."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“想必你是过于挑剔了。”凯蒂回答说，这种明快、戏谑的腔调她是信手拈来的。“据我所知，他可是香港数一数二、极受欢迎的人物。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That is surely an attractive trait."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“的确是招人喜欢的人。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Kitty, lounging easily in her chair, looked at him with smiling eyes. She turned her wedding-ring round and round her finger.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Of course he'll get on. He knows all the official ropes. Before I die I have every belief that I shall address him as Your Excellency and stand up when he enters the room."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“毫无疑问他会仕途畅达。他深谙官场上的那一套。在我有生之年一定有幸尊称他为阁下大人，在他登场时为他起立致敬。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Most people think he deserves to get on. He's generally supposed to have a great deal of ability."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不过他官升三级也是众望所归。在大家看来，他是一个才华横溢的人。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Ability? What nonsense! He's a very stupid man. He gives you the impression that he dashes off his work and gets it through from sheer brilliancy. Nothing of the kind. He's as industrious as a Eurasian clerk."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“才华？一派鬼话！他这个人愚蠢至极。他给你一种印象，让你以为他做起事来精明强干、手到擒来。但如果是真的如此那才怪呢。他跟一个欧亚混血的普通小职员没有两样，什么事儿都得按部就班拼命应付。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"There are many foolish people in the world and when a man in a rather high position puts on no frills, slaps them on the back, and tells them he'll do anything in the world for them, they are very likely to think him clever. And then of course, there's his wife. There's an able woman if you like. She has a good sound head and her advice is always worth taking. As long as Charlie Townsend's got her to depend on he's pretty safe never to do a foolish thing, and that's the first thing necessary for a man to get on in Government service. They don't want clever men; clever men have ideas, and ideas cause trouble; they want men who have charm and tact and who can be counted on never to make a blunder. Oh, yes, Charlie Townsend will get to the top of the tree all right."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这个世界上有足够多的傻瓜。当一个官居高位的人对他们不摆架子，还拍拍他们的肩膀说他会为他们力尽所能，他们想当然以为此人智慧非凡。当然了，这里面也不能少了他夫人的份儿。她是个不同凡响的女人，颇有脑子，她的点子永远值得一用。有了她在后面拿主意，查理·唐生不用担心会做出蠢事来，而这正是在官场上顺风顺水的要务所在。政府不需要聪明的人，聪明的人有主见，而主见就是麻烦。他们要的是亲和、圆滑、永不犯愚蠢错误的人。嗯，不错，查理终将爬到这个金字塔的塔顶。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"How has he got the reputation of being so clever?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"I've always heard that they were a devoted couple," said Kitty, watching him through her eyelashes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我常耳闻他们是一对鸾凤和鸣的伉俪。”凯蒂说道，她眯起眼，透过睫毛斜睨着他。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"She doesn't take his flirtations very seriously?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“她不把他的风流韵事当回事儿？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He has his little flirtations, but they're not serious. He's much too cunning to let them go to such lengths as might cause him inconvenience. And of course he isn't a passionate man; he's only a vain one. He likes admiration. He's fat and forty now, he does himself too well, but he was very good-looking when he first came to the Colony. I've often heard his wife chaff him about his conquests."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他也会闹出些风流韵事，但是都不当真。他一直行事小心，从不惹火上身，给自己找麻烦。可以肯定他不是一个耽于情爱的人，只是他爱慕虚荣，希望被女人崇拜罢了。他身体胖了，如今也有四十岁，他太会养尊处优、善待自己了。不过他初到香港时是一个英俊小伙儿。我常听他夫人拿他的姘头打趣。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I wish she were well-dressed as well as well-bred."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我希望她对穿着的品味能像她的教养那么出众。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Doesn't she dress well? I never noticed."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“她不太注重穿着？我没留意过。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He's very fond of her. I will give him that credit. I think that is the most decent thing about him."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他对她一片深情。这是我可以送给他的赞美之辞。我想这是他这个人身上最为正派的一点了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, no, she knows they don't go very far. She says she'd like to be able to make friends of the poor little things who fall to Charlie; but they're always so common. She says it's really not very flattering to her that the women who fall in love with her husband are so uncommonly second- rate."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“呃，对。她明白他只是小打小闹，不会做得过火。她说她愿意和查理那些可怜的小情人儿们交个朋友。不过她们都是些泛泛之流。她说爱上她丈夫的女人永远都是些二流货色，这简直也令她脸上无光。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But you like his wife better?" smiled Kitty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那么你更欣赏他的妻子喽？”凯蒂微笑着说道。">查看中文翻译</div>
