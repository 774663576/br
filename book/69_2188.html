<div class="line_en">What she didn't notice was that the Costas were alert every second for unusual signs of interest in Lyra from the waterside people. If she hadn't realized it, she was important, and Mrs. Coulter and the Oblation Board were bound to be searching everywhere for her. Indeed, Tony heard from gos-sip in pubs along the way that the police were making raids on houses and farms and building yards and factories without any explanation, though there was a rumor that they were searching for a missing girl. And that in itself was odd, considering all the kids that had gone missing without being looked for. Gyptians and land folk alike were getting jumpy and nervous.</div>

<div class="line_en">Now that Lyra had a task in mind, she felt much better. Helping Mrs. Coulter had been all very well, but Pantalaimon was right: she wasn't really doing any work there, she was just a pretty pet. On the gyptian boat, there was real work to do, and Ma Costa made sure she did it. She cleaned and swept, she peeled potatoes and made tea, she greased the propeller shaft bearings, she kept the weed trap clear over the propeller, she washed dishes, she opened lock gates, she tied the boat up at mooring posts, and within a couple of days she was as much at Home with this new life as if she'd been born gyptian.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在，莱拉的脑子里有了事情，便感觉好多了。给库尔特夫人帮忙也很不错，但潘特莱蒙说得对：她并没做什么正经八百的事情，仅仅是个可爱的宠物而已。而在吉卜赛人的船上，却有真正的事情要做，玛·科斯塔则督促她完成这些工作。她打扫卫生、削土豆皮、沏茶，给螺旋桨轴承上润滑油、清理螺旋桨上方的防草圈，她还刷洗盘子、打开闸门，把船的缆绳系在锚位上。不到几天工夫，她便对新生活适应得轻车熟路了，似乎生来就是个吉卜赛人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Why didn't their daemons find me, though?" she asked afterward, and Ma showed her the lining of the secret space: cedarwood, which had a soporific effect on daemons; and it was true that Pantalaimon had spent the whole time happily asleep by Lyra's head.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可他们的精灵怎么没发现我呢？”她事后问。玛·科斯塔便让她看密室的隔板，那是用杉木做成的，对精灵有催眠作用。确实，当时潘特莱蒙在莱拉脑袋边一直在甜甜地睡觉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Slowly, with many halts and detours, the Costas' boat drew nearer the fens, that wide and never fully mapped wilderness of huge skies and endless marshland in Eastern Anglia. The furthest fringe of it mingled indistinguishably with the creeks and tidal inlets of the shallow sea, and the other side of the sea mingled indistinguishably with Holland; and parts of the fens had been drained and dyked by Hollanders, some of whom had settled there; so the language of the fens was thick with Dutch. But parts had never been drained or planted or settled at all, and in the wildest central regions, where eels slithered and waterbirds flocked, where eerie marsh fires flick-ered and waylurkers tempted careless travelers to their doom in the swamps and bogs, the gyptian people had always found it safe to muster.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="慢慢地，经过很多次走走停停、迂回曲折，科斯塔家的船来到了沼泽地，那是东英格兰的一片从未在地图上完整标示出来的宽阔、荒蛮、无边无际的沼泽。它最远的边缘跟流入浅海的溪流和进潮口混在一起，难分彼此；海的另一边跟荷兰紧密相连，也是难以区分。在沼泽地中，有些地方的水已经被荷兰人抽干，并建造了堤坝，有的荷兰人在那里定居下来，因此沼泽地区的语言带有浓重的荷兰口音。但是，有些地方的水从来没被抽干过，也从来没人在那儿种植过什么东西或定居过。在最荒蛮的中部地区，鳝鱼在那里游荡，成群的水鸟在那里生活，神秘的鬼火忽明忽暗实际上是沼泽地上的沼气燃烧时的自然现象。，有的地方貌似道路，引诱着粗心大意的游客，使他们在沼泽地里遭受灭顶之灾。然而对吉卜赛人来说，这里历来就是安全的聚集场所。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So they took to keeping her below decks when they passed a lockkeeper's cottage or a canal basin, or anywhere there were likely to be idlers hanging about. Once they passed through a town where the police were searching all the boats that came along the waterway, and holding up the traffic in both directions. The Costas were equal to that, though. There was a secret compartment beneath Ma's bunk, where Lyra lay cramped for two hours while the police banged up and down the length of the boat unsuccessfully.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是，每当经过闸门管理员的小屋或运河上的水湾的时候，或者经过任何可能会有游手好闲的人出现的时候，他们便让莱拉藏在甲板下面。有一次，他们经过一个镇子，警察正在检查河上所有过往的船只，两个方向的交通都被控制住了。但科斯塔一家还是有办法对付这个。玛·科斯塔的床铺下面有个秘密隔间，莱拉蜷缩在里面躺了两个小时。警察从船头搜到船尾，东敲敲西碰碰，最后还是无功而返。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When the gyptians called a byanroping -- a summons or muster of families -- so many boats filled the waterways that you could walk for a mile in any direction over their decks; or so it was said. The gyptians ruled in the fens. No one else dared enter, and while the gyptians kept the peace and traded fairly, the landlopers turned a blind eye to the incessant smuggling and the occasional feuds. If a gyptian body floated ashore down the coast, or got snagged in a fishnet, well -- it was only a gyptian.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉卜赛人进行串联——也就是把所有的家庭都召集或集中起来的时候，水路上到处都是他们的船只，你可以在他们连成一片的甲板上朝任何方向走上一英里——至少有这种说法。吉卜赛人统治着沼泽地，别人谁也不敢到这里来；当吉卜赛人保持着和平、进行公平交易的时候，这些流浪汉们便睁一眼闭一眼地对待那些连续不断的走私和偶尔出现的争斗。如果一个吉卜赛人的尸体从海边漂到岸上，或者被鱼网绊住，那就不得了了——虽然仅仅只是一个吉卜赛人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Lyra listened enthralled to tales of the fen dwellers, of the great ghost dog Black Shuck, of the marsh fires arising from bubbles of witch oil, and began to think of herself as gyptian even before they reached the fens. She had soon slipped back into her Oxford voice, and now she was acquiring a gyptian one, complete with Fen-Dutch words. Ma Costa had to remind her of a few things.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莱拉听着有关沼泽地居民、那只名叫黑壳的幽灵大狗、从神秘的油泡泡上升起的沼泽地的鬼火的故事，完全被迷住了，还没等到达沼泽地，她便开始把自己想像为吉卜赛人了。她本来很快就不知不觉地恢复了牛津口音，但是现在，她逐渐地带上了吉卜赛人的口音，还使用沼泽地的荷兰人的词汇。玛·科斯塔不得不提醒她几件事情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And now by a thousand winding channels and creeks and watercourses, gyptian boats were moving in toward the byanplats, the only patch of slightly higher ground in the hundreds of square miles of marsh and bog.

We're water people all through, and you en't, you're a fire person. What you're most like is marsh fire, that's the place you have in the gyptian scheme; you got witch oil in your soul.

<div class="line_en">They tied up close to the Zaal itself, at a mooring Tony said had been used by their family for generations. Presently Ma Costa had the frying pan going, with a couple of fat eels hissing and sputtering and the kettle on for potato powder. Tony and Kerim oiled their hair, put on their finest leather jackets and blue spotted neckerchiefs, loaded their fingers with silver rings, and went to greet some old friends in the neighboring boats and drink a glass or two in the nearest bar. They came back with important news.</div>

<div class="line_en">When they reached the byanplats it was evening, and the sun was about to set in a splash of bloody sky.

<div class="line_en">She had thought Tony was joking. She soon found that he wasn't, or else that she looked less like a gyptian than she'd thought, for many people stared, and children pointed, and by the time they reached the great doors of the Zaal they were walking alone between a crowd on either side, who had fallen back to stare and give them room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她原以为托尼是在说笑话，但很快就发现他并没有开玩笑，要不就是她并没有自认为的那么像吉卜赛人，因为很多人都盯着她看，孩子们也对她指指点点。来到会议大厅大门的时候，他们一家子便孤零零地走在人群中间，人们都朝两边退，盯着他们看，给他们让出一条路来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He laughed loudly and ruffled Lyra's hair. Ever since they'd entered the fens he had been more and more good tempered, as if the savage gloom his face showed outside were only a disguise.

<div class="line_en">The one who remained was in his seventies, but tall and bull necked and powerful. He wore a plain canvas jacket and a checked shirt, like many gyptian men; there was nothing to mark him out but the air of strength and authority he had. Lyra recognized it: Uncle Asriel had it, and so did the Master of Jordan. This man's daemon was a crow, very like the Master's raven.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="依然站着的那个人已经有七十多岁了，但个子高，脖子粗，非常健壮。他跟许多吉卜赛人一样，穿着一件朴素的帆布上衣和带格子的衬衫，没有什么特别之处，只有身上的力量和威严的气质使他显得与众不同。莱拉注意到了这种气质：阿斯里尔叔叔有，乔丹学院的院长身上也有。这个人的精灵是一只乌鸦，跟院长的那只乌鸦精灵非常像。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At the front of the Zaal there was a platform with eight carved wooden chairs set out. As Lyra and the Costas found space to stand along the edge of the hall, eight men appeared from the shadows at the rear of the platform and stood in front of the chairs. A ripple of excitement swept over the audience as they hushed one another and shoved themselves into spaces on the nearest bench. Finally there was silence and seven of the men on the platform sat down.</div>

<div class="line_en">The hall was lit by naphtha lamps, which shone brightly enough on the faces and bodies of the audience, but left the lofty rafters hidden in darkness.

So if the Master gave you up to Mrs. Coulter when he'd promised Lord Asriel he wouldn't, he must have thought you'd be safer with her than in Jordan college, in spite of all appearances. And when he set out to poison Lord Asriel, he must have thought that what Lord Asriel was a doing would place all of them in danger, and maybe all of us, too; maybe all the world.
