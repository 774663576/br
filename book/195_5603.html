<div class="line_en">During his last year at St. Luke's Philip had to work hard. He was contented with life. He found it very comfortable to be heart-free and to have enough money for his needs. He had heard people speak contemptuously of money: he wondered if they had ever tried to do without it. He knew that the lack made a man petty, mean, grasping; it distorted his character and caused him to view the world from a vulgar angle; when you had to consider every penny, money became of grotesque importance: you needed a competency to rate it at its proper value. He lived a solitary life, seeing no one except the Athelnys, but he was not lonely; he busied himself with plans for the future, and sometimes he thought of the past. His recollection dwelt now and then on old friends, but he made no effort to see them. He would have liked to know what was become of Norah Nesbit; she was Norah something else now, but he could not remember the name of the man she was going to marry; he was glad to have known her: she was a good and a brave soul. One evening about half past eleven he saw Lawson, walking along Piccadilly; he was in evening clothes and might be supposed to be coming back from a theatre. Philip gave way to a sudden impulse and quickly turned down a side street. He had not seen him for two years and felt that he could not now take up again the interrupted friendship. He and Lawson had nothing more to say to one another. Philip was no longer interested in art; it seemed to him that he was able to enjoy beauty with greater force than when he was a boy; but art appeared to him unimportant. He was occupied with the forming of a pattern out of the manifold chaos of life, and the materials with which he worked seemed to make preoccupation with pigments and words very trivial. Lawson had served his turn. Philip's friendship with him had been a motive in the design he was elaborating: it was merely sentimental to ignore the fact that the painter was of no further interest to him.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sometimes Philip thought of Mildred. He avoided deliberately the streets in which there was a chance of seeing her; but occasionally some feeling, perhaps curiosity, perhaps something deeper which he would not acknowledge, made him wander about Piccadilly and Regent Street during the hours when she might be expected to be there. He did not know then whether he wished to see her or dreaded it. Once he saw a back which reminded him of hers, and for a moment he thought it was she; it gave him a curious sensation: it was a strange sharp pain in his heart, there was fear in it and a sickening dismay; and when he hurried on and found that he was mistaken he did not know whether it was relief that he experienced or disappointment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有时菲利普会想起米尔德里德。凡是能遇到她的街道，他都有意避而不走。可偶尔一种奇怪的心理——也许是好奇，也许是某种他不愿承认的更深层的感情——让他大半夜地跑到皮卡迪利街和摄政街去，因为米尔德里德这个时候很有可能出现在大街上。他不知道自己究竟是想见她或是怕见她。有次他看到一个似曾相识的背影，一度觉得那就是米尔德里德。他的心头涌上万般滋味：剧烈的疼痛、无名的恐惧和令人厌恶的沮丧。等他追上前去，却发现自己认错了。刹那间，他也搞不清楚自己此刻感受到的是解脱还是失望。">查看中文翻译</div>

He was nearly thirty. He walked down the stairs of the Royal College of Surgeons with the roll in his hand which qualified him to practice, and his heart beat with satisfaction.</div>

<div class="line_en">Philip would have liked a few days to himself; but he had seen the Athelnys the night before (he had gone at once to take them his good news) and there was really no reason why he should not start immediately. He had little luggage to pack. Soon after seven that evening he got out of the station at Farnley and took a cab to Doctor South's. It was a broad low stucco house, with a Virginia creeper growing over it. He was shown into the consulting-room. An old man was writing at a desk. He looked up as the maid ushered Philip in. He did not get up, and he did not speak; he merely stared at Philip. Philip was taken aback.</div>

<div class="line_en">Philip thought for a moment. He had nothing to do for the next few weeks, and he was glad of the chance to earn a bit of money.

<div class="line_en">Doctor South amused him by his odd manner. He got up now, and Philip saw that he was a man of middle height, thin, with white hair cut very short and a long mouth closed so tightly that he seemed to have no lips at all; he was clean-shaven but for small white whiskers, and they increased the squareness of face which his firm jaw gave him. He wore a brown tweed suit and a white stock. His clothes hung loosely about him as though they had been made for a much larger man. He looked like a respectable farmer of the middle of the nineteenth century. He opened the door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="索斯医生古里古怪的气质让菲利普觉得很有趣。他站起身来，菲利普这才发现他身材不高不矮，非常瘦，花白的头发剃得很短，一张大嘴紧紧抿着，看上去好像没长嘴唇似的。他的脸上干干净净，只有两腮蓄了一点白色的胡须，配上那个宽宽的下颌，让他的脸型看起来更加方正。他穿着棕色的花呢套装，露出白色的硬领巾。衣服穿在他身上松松垮垮的，好像本来是给一个块头更大的人做的。他看上去活像十九世纪中期某个颇有声望、受人敬仰的农夫。他打开门。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The young men who were sent down to him knew only hospital practice; and they came with the unconcealed scorn for the General Practitioner which they had absorbed in the air at the hospital; but they had seen only the complicated cases which appeared in the wards; they knew how to treat an obscure disease of the suprarenal bodies, but were helpless when consulted for a cold in the head. Their knowledge was theoretical and their self-assurance unbounded. Doctor South watched them with tightened lips; he took a savage pleasure in showing them how great was their ignorance and how unjustified their conceit. It was a poor practice, of fishing folk, and the doctor made up his own prescriptions. Doctor South asked his assistant how he expected to make both ends meet if he gave a fisherman with a stomach-ache a mixture consisting of half a dozen expensive drugs. He complained too that the young medical men were uneducated: their reading consisted of The Sporting Times and The British Medical Journal; they could neither write a legible hand nor spell correctly. For two or three days Doctor South watched Philip closely, ready to fall on him with acid sarcasm if he gave him the opportunity; and Philip, aware of this, went about his work with a quiet sense of amusement. He was pleased with the change of occupation. He liked the feeling of independence and of responsibility. All sorts of people came to the consulting-room. He was gratified because he seemed able to inspire his patients with confidence; and it was entertaining to watch the process of cure which at a hospital necessarily could be watched only at distant intervals. His rounds took him into low-roofed cottages in which were fishing tackle and sails and here and there mementoes of deep-sea travelling, a lacquer box from Japan, spears and oars from Melanesia, or daggers from the bazaars of Stamboul; there was an air of romance in the stuffy little rooms, and the salt of the sea gave them a bitter freshness. Philip liked to talk to the sailor-men, and when they found that he was not supercilious they told him long yarns of the distant journeys of their youth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="派到这来工作的年轻人都只会医院的那一套工作。受到医院里潜移默化的影响，他们对所谓的全科医生带着股藏不住的轻蔑劲儿。他们知道怎么医治疑难杂症，却不会对付发烧感冒、头疼脑热。他们脑子里那点儿学问只局限在书本上，可自信心倒是来得无边无际。索斯医生看着他们干活，紧紧抿着嘴唇。他最喜欢揭露这些人的无知，指明他们的自负是毫无道理的。来这看病的都是些穷得叮当响的渔民，从他们身上赚不来几个钱，医生还要亲自负责下处方。索斯医生质问助理，要是他给胃疼的病人开的处方里有一半都是昂贵的药剂，这医院还怎么开下去？他还抱怨这些年轻的医生都没什么学问，只知道读《体育时报》和《英国医学杂志》；他们的字写得乱七八糟，拼写还常常出错。刚来的两三天里，索斯医生密切观察着菲利普，准备一逮到机会就好好讽刺他一顿。菲利普早就发现了这点，一边工作一边静观其变，只觉得心里好笑。能这样换一换工作，他觉得非常高兴。他喜欢这种自己做主的感觉，也享受肩上担着的责任。来门诊室看病的人包罗万象。只要能让病人重获信心，他就足够心满意足了。在这里，他能密切观察病人的治疗过程，可是在医院却只能远远地看几眼。外出巡诊的时候他到渔民家去，那些低矮的小屋里挂着渔具、船帆还有每次远航的纪念品，日本带回的漆盒、美拉尼西亚带回的长矛船桨和在斯坦布尔的集市上买来的匕首等等。屋子虽小虽闷，却带着大海咸咸的气息，别有一番清新风味。菲利普喜欢和船员聊天，他们也发现菲利普特别平易近人，便把年轻时候出海的惊险经历都说给他听。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He soon discovered why Doctor South's assistants found it difficult to get on with him. In the first place, he set his face firmly against all the discoveries of the last thirty years: he had no patience with the drugs which became modish, were thought to work marvellous cures, and in a few years were discarded; he had stock mixtures which he had brought from St. Luke's where he had been a student, and had used all his life; he found them just as efficacious as anything that had come into fashion since. Philip was startled at Doctor South's suspicion of asepsis; he had accepted it in deference to universal opinion; but he used the precautions which Philip had known insisted upon so scrupulously at the hospital with the disdainful tolerance of a man playing at soldiers with children.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没过多久，菲利普就明白为什么索斯医生之前的几任助理都觉得和他共事很头疼。首先，他对近三十年来医学界的所有重大发现都无动于衷，从来不使用那些流行的品种，即使大家认为这些药疗效卓著，不过几年后它们就都被淘汰了。他曾经在圣鲁克学医，从那带来了好些最普通的混合药剂。他一辈子都只给病人开这几味药，坚信它和最近流行的新药有同样的功效。菲利普还惊讶地发现索斯医生对无菌操作持怀疑态度，他之所以勉强接受，仅仅是出于对大众观点的妥协。在医院里小心翼翼采取的那些预防措施，他统统看不上眼，只像大人逗着小孩儿玩耍一样，草草应付了事。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Once or twice he made a mistake in diagnosis: (he had never seen a case of measles before, and when he was confronted with the rash took it for an obscure disease of the skin;) and once or twice his ideas of treatment differed from Doctor South's. The first time this happened Doctor South attacked him with savage irony; but Philip took it with good humour; he had some gift for repartee, and he made one or two answers which caused Doctor South to stop and look at him curiously. Philip's face was grave, but his eyes were twinkling. The old gentleman could not avoid the impression that Philip was chaffing him. He was used to being disliked and feared by his assistants, and this was a new experience. He had half a mind to fly into a passion and pack Philip off by the next train, he had done that before with his assistants; but he had an uneasy feeling that Philip then would simply laugh at him outright; and suddenly he felt amused. His mouth formed itself into a smile against his will, and he turned away. In a little while he grew conscious that Philip was amusing himself systematically at his expense. He was taken aback at first and then diverted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="菲利普有过一两次错诊（他从没经手治疗过麻疹病，第一次看到这种疹子的时候还以为是皮肤科的疑难杂症），还有一两次，他的诊断结果和索斯医生的不符。第一次遇到这种情况时，索斯医生把他好一番挖苦，而他也没怎么生气。他一向反应灵敏，简单的几句回话就让索斯医生哑口无言，一脸好奇地看着他。菲利普表情严肃，可眼里却忽闪忽闪的。这位老先生不得不觉得菲利普正在嘲笑他哩。之前的助理都讨厌他、害怕他，而他早就对此习以为常。可菲利普的表现对他来说却新鲜极了。他脑海里飞过一个想法，想把菲利普塞到下一班回伦敦的火车，让他抓紧滚蛋。他之前就这样对待过其他助理。可转念一想，又觉得隐隐不安，生怕菲利普会不留情面地大声嘲笑他。就这么一来二去，他觉得自己实在滑稽，于是勉强做出个笑脸，转身走开了。没过多久，他发现菲利普就是在拿他寻开心。起初他有些生气，后来也渐渐释怀。">查看中文翻译</div>
