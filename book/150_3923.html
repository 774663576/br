<div class="line_en">"Everything that can be broken is broken when it comes here, but the statue presented to us by our benefactor came from Paris without so much as the smallest chip. There is no doubt that it was a miracle."</div>

<div class="line_en">The chapel was no more than a long low room with whitewashed walls and rows of deal benches; at the end was the altar on which stood the image; it was in plaster of Paris painted in crude colours; it was very bright and new and garish. Behind it was a picture in oils of the Crucifixion with the two Marys at the foot of the Cross in extravagant attitudes of grief. The drawing was bad and the dark pigments were put on with an eye that knew nothing of the beauty of colour. Around the walls were the Stations of the Cross painted by the same unfortunate hand. The chapel was hideous and vulgar.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="礼拜堂其实只是一个低矮的长形房间，四面是粉刷过的白墙，中间摆放着几排松木长椅，尽头是圣坛，院长所说的雕像矗立在那里。那是一座在巴黎雕刻而成的石膏像，上面不太细致地涂了一层色彩，显得光艳而俗丽。雕像背后是一幅耶稣受难像的油画，画上十字架的下方两个玛丽像神情悲痛万分。线条的描绘相当拙劣；从深色颜料被大幅渲染来看，作者对色彩的鉴赏力实在令人不敢恭维。墙上另画有十四幅耶稣受难像，显然与先前那幅出自同一人手笔。总的来说，礼拜堂给人一种粗陋、俗气的感觉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The altarpiece and the Stations of the Cross were painted by one of our Sisters, Soeur St Anselme." The Mother Superior crossed herself. "She was a real artist. Unfortunately, she fell a victim to the epidemic. Do you not think that they are very beautiful?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“圣坛和墙上的受难像是我们的一个姐妹画的，圣安塞姆姐妹。”院长在胸前画了个十字，“她是一个真正的艺术家。不幸的是，她没能逃过这次劫难。你们看，这些画儿不是很美吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Kitty faltered an affirmative. On the altar were bunches of paper flowers and the candlesticks were distract-ingly ornate.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Mother Superior led them into a tiny room on the other side of the passage. On a table, under a cloth, there was a singular wriggling. The Sister drew back the cloth and displayed four tiny, naked infants. They were very red and they made funny restless movements with their arms and legs; their quaint little Chinese faces were screwed up into strange grimaces. They looked hardly human; queer animals of an unknown species, and yet there was something singularly moving in the sight. The Mother Superior looked at them with an amused smile.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="修道院长把他们领到了走廊另一端的小房间里。屋子里有一张桌子，上面盖了一块布，布下面有什么东西蠕动着。圣约瑟姐妹将布拉开，下面现出四个光溜溜的小婴儿来。她们全身通红，手脚不停地乱舞。一张张中国人样子的小脸儿古怪有趣，皱巴巴地扭出了苦相。凯蒂觉得她们不像人类，而是某种罕见的不知名的动物。不过这一幕还是让她有所感动。修道院长瞧着这群小东西，脸上露出了欣然的微笑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then Kitty and Waddington found themselves at the door. Kitty gravely thanked the Mother Superior for the trouble she had taken. The nun bowed with a condescension that was at once dignified and affable.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凯蒂和韦丁顿来到了修道院的门外。凯蒂对院长的款待郑重地表示感谢。这位嬷嬷谦逊地鞠了一躬，仪态温和而不失高贵。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The lady's husband will be pleased with them," said Sister St Joseph. "I think he could play by the hour with the babies. When they cry he has only to take them up, and he makes them comfortable in the crook of his arm, so that they laugh with delight."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“您的先生很喜欢和这些小婴儿待在一起。”圣约瑟姐妹说道，“我觉得他能和她们一起玩上几个钟头。要是她们哭了，他就把她们抱起来，放到臂弯里哄，直到把她们逗笑了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"They seem very lively. Sometimes they are brought in only to die. Of course we baptize them the moment they come."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“她们看起来非常可爱。有的时候她们刚抱过来就死了。当然了，每来一个婴儿我们都会先做洗礼。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It has been a great pleasure. You do not know how kind and helpful your husband has been to us. He has been sent to us by Heaven. I am glad that you came with him. When he goes home it must be a great comfort to him to have you there with your love and your -- your sweet face. You must take care of him and not let him work too hard. You must look after him for all our sakes."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这是我莫大的荣幸。你不能想象你的丈夫有多么仁慈，他帮了我们的大忙。我认为他是天堂派来的使者。我非常高兴你也一同前来。等他回去的时候，有你陪在身边，你将用你的爱和你的——你的甜美的笑脸给予他最大的安慰。请你务必照顾好他，千万不要让他工作过于辛苦。请替我们所有人照料好他。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Kitty flushed. She did not know what to say. The Mother Superior held out her hand and while she held it Kitty was conscious of those cool, thoughtful eyes which rested on her with detachment and yet with something that looked like a profound understanding.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凯蒂的脸红了，她找不出话来回应。修道院长伸出了手，凯蒂握住了它。院长那双淡然的、评判的眼睛又注视着凯蒂，眼神坦白直率，同时似乎在向凯蒂表示深深的理解。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sister St Joseph closed the door behind them and Kitty got into her chair. They went back through the narrow, winding streets. Waddington made a casual remark; Kitty did not answer. He looked round, but the side curtains of the chair were drawn and he could not see her. He walked on in silence. But when they reached the river and she stepped out, to his surprise he saw that her eyes were streaming with tears.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="圣约瑟姐妹在他们身后关住了门，凯蒂迈上了轿子。他们穿过狭窄曲折的街道，韦丁顿随意问了句话，凯蒂没有回答。他朝凯蒂看了一眼，轿子的挂帘拉上了，看不到里面。他不再说什么，默默地继续走路。当他们来到河边的时候，她从轿子里走了出来。他吃惊地发现她的脸上流着眼泪。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What is the matter?" he asked, his face puckered into an expression of dismay.</div>
