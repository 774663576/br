<div class="line_en">Emma had hardly expected them: for Mr. Weston, who had called in for half a minute, in order to hear that his son was very handsome, knew nothing of their plans; and it was an agreeable surprize to her, therefore, to perceive them walking up to the house together, arm in arm. She was wanting to see him again, and especially to see him in company with Mrs. Weston, upon his behaviour to whom her opinion of him was to depend. If he were deficient there, nothing should make amends for it. But on seeing them together, she became perfectly satisfied. It was not merely in fine words or hyperbolical compliment that he paid his duty; nothing could be more proper or pleasing than his whole manner to her-nothing could more agreeably denote his wish of considering her as a friend and securing her affection. And there was time enough for Emma to form a reasonable judgment, as their visit included all the rest of the morning. They were all three walking about together for an hour or two -- first round the shrubberies of Hartfield, and afterwards in Highbury. He was delighted with every thing; admired Hartfield sufficiently for Mr. Woodhouse's ear; and when their going farther was resolved on, confessed his wish to be made acquainted with the whole village, and found matter of commendation and interest much oftener than Emma could have supposed.</div>

<div class="line_en">The next morning brought Mr. Frank Churchill again. He came with Mrs. Weston, to whom and to Highbury he seemed to take very cordially. He had been sitting with her, it appeared, most companionably at home, till her usual hour of exercise; and on being desired to chuse their walk, immediately fixed on Highbury. --"He did not doubt there being very pleasant walks in every direction, but if left to him, he should always chuse the same. Highbury, that airy, cheerful, happy-looking Highbury, would be his constant attraction." -- Highbury, with Mrs. Weston, stood for Hartfield; and she trusted to its bearing the same construction with him. They walked thither directly.</div>

<div class="line_en">Some of the objects of his curiosity spoke very amiable feelings. He begged to be shewn the house which his father had lived in so long, and which had been the home of his father's father; and on recollecting that an old woman who had nursed him was still living, walked in quest of her cottage from one end of the street to the other; and though in some points of pursuit or observation there was no positive merit, they shewed, altogether, a good-will towards Highbury in general, which must be very like a merit to those he was with.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有些东西引起他的兴趣，说明他心里怀有缱绻的情意。他恳求带他去看看他父亲住过多年的房子，那房子也是他祖父的家。后来想起那个带过他的老太太现在还活着，便从街这头走到街那头，寻找她住的小屋。虽然他寻求的某些东西、说的某些话，并没有什么实在的价值，但是把这一切加在一起，总的看来他对海伯里颇有好感，这在跟他一道散步的人看来，倒肯定是一个优点。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Emma watched and decided, that with such feelings as were now shewn, it could not be fairly supposed that he had been ever voluntarily absenting himself; that he had not been acting a part, or making a parade of insincere professions; and that Mr. Knightley certainly had not done him justice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱玛通过观察断定：既然他现在流露出这样的感情，那就不能认为他以前是故意不肯来；他不是在装模作样，也不是虚情假意地故作姿态；奈特利先生对他的看法肯定有失公道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Their first pause was at the Crown Inn, an inconsiderable house, though the principal one of the sort, where a couple of pair of post-horses were kept, more for the convenience of the neighbourhood than from any run on the road; and his companions had not expected to be detained by any interest excited there; but in passing it they gave the history of the large room visibly added; it had been built many years ago for a ball-room, and while the neighbourhood had been in a particularly populous, dancing state, had been occasionally used as such; -- but such brilliant days had long passed away, and now the highest purpose for which it was ever wanted was to accommodate a whist club established among the gentlemen and half-gentlemen of the place. He was immediately interested. Its character as a ball-room caught him; and instead of passing on, he stopt for several minutes at the two superior sashed windows which were open, to look in and contemplate its capabilities, and lament that its original purpose should have ceased. He saw no fault in the room, he would acknowledge none which they suggested. No, it was long enough, broad enough, handsome enough. It would hold the very number for comfort. They ought to have balls there at least every fortnight through the winter. Why had not Miss Woodhouse revived the former good old days of the room? -- She who could do any thing in Highbury! The want of proper families in the place, and the conviction that none beyond the place and its immediate environs could be tempted to attend, were mentioned; but he was not satisfied. He could not be persuaded that so many good-looking houses as he saw around him, could not furnish numbers enough for such a meeting; and even when particulars were given and families described, he was still unwilling to admit that the inconvenience of such a mixture would be any thing, or that there would be the smallest difficulty in every body's returning into their proper place the next morning. He argued like a young man very much bent on dancing; and Emma was rather surprized to see the constitution of the Weston prevail so decidedly against the habits of the Churchills. He seemed to have all the life and spirit, cheerful feelings, and social inclinations of his father, and nothing of the pride or reserve of Enscombe. Of pride, indeed, there was, perhaps, scarcely enough; his indifference to a confusion of rank, bordered too much on inelegance of mind. He could be no judge, however, of the evil he was holding cheap. It was but an effusion of lively spirits.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们第一个停留的地方是克朗旅店。虽然这是当地主要的一家旅店，但是规模却不大，只养着两对驿马，与其说是供来往客人雇用，不如说是为附近一带的人提供方便。弗兰克的两位同伴没想到他会对这地方感兴趣，就在打这儿走过时，讲起了那间一看就知道是后来加上去的大屋子的来历。那是多年前造来作舞厅用的。当时，这一带人特别多，又特别爱跳舞，有时就在这间屋里举行舞会。但是，那种明媚灿烂的日子早就一去不复返了，如今，它的最大用途，是作为本地一些绅士和半绅士组织的惠斯特俱乐部的活动场所。弗兰克当即就产生了兴趣。听说这是个舞厅，他便来了劲儿。他没有继续往前走，而是在两扇开着的、装有上等框格的窗子跟前停了几分钟，朝里面望望，估量能容纳多少人，为它失去原先的用途感到遗憾。他觉得这间屋子没有什么缺陷，他们说的那些缺陷，他并不认为是缺陷。不，这间屋子够长、够宽、够漂亮的啦，在里面跳舞再适意不过了。整个冬天，应该至少每两周在这里举行一次舞会。伍德豪斯小姐为什么没有恢复这间屋子昔日的好时光呢？她在海伯里可是什么都办得到的啊！爱玛解释说，这里没有几家合适的人家，附近一带又没有人愿意来，但他听了却不以为然。他看到周围有那么多漂亮的房子，说什么也不相信会凑不齐人数开舞会。甚至在爱玛讲述了详细情况和各家的家境之后，他仍然认为这样贫富同乐不会带来多大的不便，第二天早晨大家又都各守本分，不会有丝毫的困难。他就像一个热衷于跳舞的年轻人一样争辩着。爱玛发现在他身上，韦斯顿家的气质完全压倒了邱吉尔家的习性，不由得大吃一惊。看来，他还真像他父亲那样，生气勃勃，精力充沛，性情开朗，喜欢交际，全然没有恩斯库姆的傲慢和矜持。也许他的确没有多少傲慢。他不计较地位的高低，心灵未免有些近乎庸俗了。然而，他又判断不出被他轻视的那种祸害。那不过是他生性活跃的一种表现罢了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes, oh! yes" -- he replied; "I was just going to mention it. A very successful visit: -- I saw all the three ladies; and felt very much obliged to you for your preparatory hint. If the talking aunt had taken me quite by surprize, it must have been the death of me. As it was, I was only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit. Ten minutes would have been all that was necessary, perhaps all that was proper; and I had told my father I should certainly be at home before him-but there was no getting away, no pause; and, to my utter astonishment, I found, when he (finding me nowhere else) joined me there at last, that I had been actually sitting with them very nearly three-quarters of an hour. The good lady had not given me the possibility of escape before."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“去了，哦！去了，”弗兰克回答说。“我正要说这件事呢。我去得还真是巧啊，三位女士我全见到了，多亏你事先嘱咐了我。如果我毫无思想准备遇上了那位喋喋不休的姨妈，那可准会要了我的命。其实，我只是有些身不由己，稀里糊涂地多待了些时候。本来十分钟就足够了，也许再恰当不过了。我还跟我父亲说过，我一定会比他先回家——谁想我根本脱不了身，话说个没完没了。我父亲在别处找不到我，最后也跟到贝茨家，这时我万分惊讶地发现，我在那里已经坐了将近三刻钟。那位好心的老太太一直不给我脱身的机会。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Ill, very ill-that is, if a young lady can ever be allowed to look ill. But the expression is hardly admissible, Mrs. Weston, is it? Ladies can never look ill. And, seriously, Miss Fairfax is naturally so pale, as almost always to give the appearance of ill health. -- A most deplorable want of complexion."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“气色不好，很不好——就是说，如果一位年轻小姐可以被认为气色不好的话。不过，这种说法是不大容易被人接受的，是吧，韦斯顿太太？小姐们是决不会气色不好的。说真的，费尔法克斯小姐天生就这么脸色苍白，几乎总是给人一种身体不好的样子。脸色这么不好，真令人可怜。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Emma would not agree to this, and began a warm defence of Miss Fairfax's complexion. "It was certainly never brilliant, but she would not allow it to have a sickly hue in general; and there was a softness and delicacy in her skin which gave peculiar elegance to the character of her face." He listened with all due deference; acknowledged that he had heard many people say the same-but yet he must confess, that to him nothing could make amends for the want of the fine glow of health. Where features were indifferent, a fine complexion gave beauty to them all; and where they were good, the effect was-fortunately he need not attempt to describe what the effect was.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱玛不同意他的这一看法，便极力为费尔法克斯小姐的脸色辩护起来。“她的确没有容光焕发过，可是总的说来，我觉得也没有什么病容。她皮肤娇嫩，给她的面孔增添了几分独特的优雅。”弗兰克恭恭敬敬地听着，承认说他也听到好多人都这么说过——然而坦白地说，在他看来，一个人缺乏健康的神采，那是无论如何也无法弥补的。即使五官长得很一般，只要气色好，五官也会显得很美。要是五官长得秀丽，那效果就——好在他用不着说明效果会怎么样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At this moment they were approaching Ford's, and he hastily exclaimed, "Ha! this must be the very shop that every body attends every day of their lives, as my father informs me. He comes to Highbury himself, he says, six days out of the seven, and has always business at Ford's. If it be not inconvenient to you, pray let us go in, that I may prove myself to belong to the place, to be a true citizen of Highbury. I must buy something at Ford's. It will be taking out my freedom. -- I dare say they sell gloves."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“哦！是的，手套什么的都有。我真钦佩你的乡上观念。你在海伯里会受到敬重的。你没来之前，大家就很喜欢你了，因为你是韦斯顿先生的儿子。不过，你要是在福特商店花上半个几尼，你的受人喜欢就建立在你的美德的基础上了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“那有什么好的！”爱玛笑着说道。“宁愿要个陌生人，也不要个特别要好的朋友——如果是个陌生人，就不会再出这种事儿——可是身边总有个特别要好的朋友，什么事儿都比你自己做得好，那有多么不幸啊！可怜的迪克逊夫人！她去爱尔兰定居，我看倒也挺好。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh! do not imagine that I expect an account of Miss Fairfax's sensations from you, or from any body else. They are known to no human being, I guess, but herself. But if she continued to play whenever she was asked by Mr. Dixon, one may guess what one chuses."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦！可别以为我想让你或是别人说说费尔法克斯小姐有什么感受。我猜想，除了她自己以外，别人谁也不知道她有什么感受。但是，如果迪克逊先生每次请她弹琴她都弹的话，那别人就可以爱怎么猜就怎么猜了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"So much the better-or so much the worse: -- I do not know which. But be it sweetness or be it stupidity in her-quickness of friendship, or dulness of feeling-there was one person, I think, who must have felt it: Miss Fairfax herself. She must have felt the improper and dangerous distinction."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这就更好了——要么就更糟了：我不知道是好是糟。不管她是出于可爱，还是出于愚蠢——是出于朋友间的坦率，还是出于感觉的迟钝——我想有一个人肯定感觉到了，那就是费尔法克斯小姐。她一定感觉到了这种不恰当而又危险的区别。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"There appeared such a perfectly good understanding among them all --" he began rather quickly, but checking himself, added, "however, it is impossible for me to say on what terms they really were -- how it might all be behind the scenes. I can only say that there was smoothness outwardly. But you, who have known Miss Fairfax from a child, must be a better judge of her character, and of how she is likely to conduct herself in critical situations, than I can be."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“她们三人之间好像倒是十分融洽的——”弗兰克脱口而出，可是马上又打住了，补充说道：“不过，我也说不上他们的关系究竟怎么样——背地里又怎么样。我只能说，表面上和和气气。不过，你从小就认识费尔法克斯小姐，当然比我更了解她的性格，更了解她在紧要关头会有什么表现，”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Not till the reserve ceases towards oneself; and then the attraction may be the greater. But I must be more in want of a friend, or an agreeable companion, than I have yet been, to take the trouble of conquering any body's reserve to procure one. Intimacy between Miss Fairfax and me is quite out of the question. I have no reason to think ill of her-not the least-except that such extreme and perpetual cautiousness of word and manner, such a dread of giving a distinct idea about any body, is apt to suggest suspicions of there being something to conceal."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“除非不再沉默寡言，那样一来，就会更加讨人喜欢。不过，我比以往任何时候都更需要一个朋友，或者说一个称心的伙伴，才能帮助别人克服沉默寡言的毛病，交上一个朋友。我和费尔法克斯小姐是亲密不起来的。我没有理由看不起她——丝毫没有——不过她的言谈举止总是那么谨小慎微的，不敢对任何人发表一点明确的看法，叫人难免不怀疑她有什么事瞒着别人。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I have known her from a child, undoubtedly; we have been children and women together; and it is natural to suppose that we should be intimate, -- that we should have taken to each other whenever she visited her friends. But we never did. I hardly know how it has happened; a little, perhaps, from that wickedness on my side which was prone to take disgust towards a girl so idolized and so cried up as she always was, by her aunt and grandmother, and all their set. And then, her reserve-I never could attach myself to any one so completely reserved."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不错，我是从小就认识她。我们从小在一起，后来又一起长大成人。因此，人家自然会以为我们关系密切，以为她每次来看朋友，我们都该很亲热。可是，我们从来就没有亲热过。我简直不知道是怎么回事儿。也许我这个人有点不厚道，她姨妈、外婆那一伙人一个劲儿地宠爱她、吹捧她，我就禁不住要讨厌她。再说，她又不爱说话——我决不会喜欢一个金口难开的人。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mrs. Weston laughed, and said he did not know what he was talking about. Used only to a large house himself, and without ever thinking how many advantages and accommodations were attached to its size, he could be no judge of the privations inevitably belonging to a small one. But Emma, in her own mind, determined that he did know what he was talking about, and that he shewed a very amiable inclination to settle early in life, and to marry, from worthy motives. He might not be aware of the inroads on domestic peace to be occasioned by no housekeeper's room, or a bad butler's pantry, but no doubt he did perfectly feel that Enscombe could not make him happy, and that whenever he were attached, he would willingly give up much of wealth to be allowed an early establishment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="韦斯顿太太笑了，说他说话没有谱。他自己住惯了大房子，从没考虑房子大有多少好处和方便，因而也不清楚住小房子在所难免的苦处。然而，爱玛却另有看法，断定他说话还是有谱的，表明他出于美好的动机，想要早一点成家。他可能没有意识到，要是女管家没屋子住，或者配膳室不像样，那会给家庭安适带来什么损害，但他一定会感到恩斯库姆不会给他带来幸福，他一旦爱上了谁，就会宁愿放弃大笔财产，也要早日成家。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He perfectly agreed with her: and after walking together so long, and thinking so much alike, Emma felt herself so well acquainted with him, that she could hardly believe it to be only their second meeting. He was not exactly what she had expected; less of the man of the world in some of his notions, less of the spoiled child of fortune, therefore better than she had expected. His ideas seemed more moderate -- his feelings warmer. She was particularly struck by his manner of considering Mr. Elton's house, which, as well as the church, he would go and look at, and would not join them in finding much fault with. No, he could not believe it a bad house; not such a house as a man was to be pitied for having. If it were to be shared with the woman he loved, he could not think any man to be pitied for having that house. There must be ample room in it for every real comfort. The man must be a blockhead who wanted more.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="弗兰克完全同意她的看法。两人一起走了这么远，想法又这么接近，爱玛觉得他们已经很熟悉了，简直不相信这只是他们的第二次会面。他跟她原来想象的不尽相同：从他的某些见解来看，他并不是个老于世故的人，也不像个娇生惯养的富家子弟，因而比她想象的要好些。他的观点似乎比较温和——感情似乎比较热烈。令她特别感动的是，他不仅要去看那教堂，还要去看看埃尔顿先生的住宅，别人挑剔这房子的毛病，他也不跟着随声附和。不，他并不认为这座房子有什么不好，房主人也不该因为住这样的房子而受人怜悯。只要能同自己心爱的女人一起住在里面，那么，不管哪介男人拥有这座房子，他都觉得没有什么可怜悯的。谁还有更高的奢望，那他一定是个傻瓜。">查看中文翻译</div>
