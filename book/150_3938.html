<div class="line_en">Two or three days later Waddington fetched Kitty from the convent (for her restlessness had induced her immediately to resume her work) and took her to drink the promised cup of tea with his mistress. Kitty had on more than one occasion dined at Waddington's house. It was a square, white, and pretentious building, such as the Customs build for their officials all over China; and the dining-room in which they ate, the drawing-room in which they sat, were furnished with prim and solid furniture. They had the appearance of being partly offices and partly hotel; there was nothing homelike in them and you understood that these houses were merely places of haphazard sojourn to their successive occupants. It would never have occurred to you that on an upper floor mystery and perhaps romance dwelt shrouded. They ascended a flight of stairs and Waddington opened a door. Kitty went into a large, bare room with whitewashed walls on which hung scrolls in various calligraphies. At a square table, on a stiff arm-chair, both of blackwood and heavily carved, sat the Manchu. She rose as Kitty and Waddington entered, but made no step forward.</div>

<div class="line_en">Kitty shook hands with her. She was slim in her long embroidered gown and somewhat taller than Kitty, used to the Southern people, had expected. She wore a jacket of pale green silk with tight sleeves that came over her wrists and on her black hair, elaborately dressed, was the head-dress of the Manchu women. Her face was coated with powder and her cheeks from the eyes to the mouth heavily rouged; her plucked eyebrows were a thin dark line and her mouth was scarlet. From this mask her black, slightly slanting, large eyes burned like lakes of liquid jet. She seemed more like an idol than a woman. Her movements were slow and assured. Kitty had the impression that she was slightly shy but very curious. She nodded her head two or three times, looking at Kitty, while Waddington spoke of her. Kitty noticed her hands; they were preternaturally long, very slender, of the colour of ivory; and the exquisite nails were painted. Kitty thought she had never seen anything so lovely as those languid and elegant hands. They suggested the breeding of uncounted centuries.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凯蒂和她握了握手。她身穿一套修长的绣花旗袍，身材显得十分苗条，个子比凯蒂印象中的南方人要高一点。她上身穿了一件浅绿色的丝绸外套，两条瘦瘦的袖子一直盖住了手背。黑色的头发按照满人的风俗盘成发髻，上面镶了繁多的饰物。她的脸上涂了一层胭脂，脸颊从下眼皮到上嘴唇抹着厚厚的红粉。眉毛明显拔过，只见一道黑色的细线。嘴唇涂得血红。在这张面孔之中，一双大大的眼睛微微斜睨，如同一汪波光闪烁的墨色湖水。与其说这是一张女人的脸，不如说倒更像是一个人偶。她的举止温文尔雅，慢条斯理，凯蒂觉得她略有羞涩，但同时对来客充满了好奇。韦丁顿向她介绍凯蒂的时候，她的眼睛始终看着凯蒂，点了两三下头。凯蒂注意到了她的手。这是一双修长、细嫩的手，如同象牙一般洁白，指甲做过精心的修饰，每一只都涂好了指甲油。凯蒂觉得她从未见过什么像这双柔弱、精致的手一般惹人爱怜。这双手无疑暗示了绵延了上百年的贵族教养。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She spoke a little, in a high voice, like the twittering of birds in an orchard, and Waddington, translating, told Kitty that she was glad to see her; how old was she and how many children had she got? They sat down on three straight chairs at the square table and a boy brought in bowls of tea, pale and scented with jasmine. The Manchu lady handed Kitty a green tin of Three Castles cigarettes. Beside the table and the chairs the room contained little furniture; there was a wide pallet bed on which was an embroidered head rest and two sandalwood chests.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她说了几句话，声音又尖又细，像是果园里唧唧咻咻的小鸟儿。韦丁顿向凯蒂翻译说她很高兴见到凯蒂，问凯蒂年方几许，膝下有几个孩子。他们在方桌边的三把直背椅子上坐了下来，一个童仆端进来几碗茶，茶水颜色很淡，有股茉莉花的香味。这位满洲女人递给凯蒂一个绿色的锡盒，里面装着“三堡”牌的纸烟。除了桌椅之外，屋子里就几乎没什么家具了，只有一张宽大的地榻，上面摆着一个绣花枕头，另有两个檀香木的衣橱。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When this was translated to the Manchu she gave Kitty a quick glance in which there was the hint of a smile. She was impressive as she sat, without embarrassment, in her beautiful clothes; and from the painted face the eyes looked out wary, self-possessed, and unfathomable. She was unreal, like a picture, and yet had an elegance which made Kitty feel all thumbs. Kitty had never paid anything but passing and somewhat contemptuous attention to the China in which fate had thrown her. It was not done in her set. Now she seemed on a sudden to have an inkling of something remote and mysterious. Here was the East, immemorial, dark, and inscrutable. The beliefs and the ideals of the West seemed crude beside ideals and beliefs of which in this exquisite creature she seemed to catch a fugitive glimpse. Here was a different life, lived on a different plane. Kitty felt strangely that the sight of this idol, with her painted face and slanting, wary eyes, made the efforts and the pains of the everyday world she knew slightly absurd. That coloured mask seemed to hide the secret of an abundant, profound, and significant experience; those long, delicate hands with their tapering fingers held the key of riddles undivined.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="韦丁顿把凯蒂的话翻译给这位满人的时候，她含情脉脉地朝凯蒂看了一眼。她的坐姿给人印象很深，得体大方，丝毫不显拘谨。涂满胭脂的脸上，一双眼睛机警、沉稳，深不可测。她是不真实的，她像是一幅画，纤弱优美，使得凯蒂相形见绌。命运将凯蒂带到中国以后，她对这里的事事物物不是不屑一顾，就是心怀鄙视，即便是对她常来往的那个圈子也是如此。此刻她的心里朦朦胧胧浮起一种遥远、神秘的感觉。是的，她方才意识到这里是东方，古老、玄异、深邃的东方。从这位体态优雅的女子身上，凯蒂隐约看到了东方的理想和信仰。与之相比，西方人的所谓信念就显得粗陋野蛮了。这里的人们过的是一种截然不同的生活，与她分属于两个世界。看着眼前这个人偶涂脂抹粉的脸、斜睨机警的眼神，凯蒂忽然生出一股奇怪的感觉，似乎世俗众生的忙忙碌碌、苦乐哀愁，在这位满人面前都是荒诞不经的。这张色彩艳丽的面具后面，隐藏的是对世间万物的真知灼见，她五指修长的柔嫩的手，握的是这个未知世界的钥匙。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Manchu laughed but once. This was when Kitty, for something to say, expressed admiration of a jade bracelet she wore. She took it off and Kitty, trying to put it on, found, though her hands were small enough, that it would not pass over her knuckles. Then the Manchu burst into childlike laughter. She said something to Waddington and called for an amah. She gave her an instruction and the amah in a moment brought in a pair of very beautiful Manchu shoes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这位满洲女人只笑过一次，就是凯蒂为了开个话头儿，故意对她腕子上的翡翠手镯表现出欣赏之情；她便将手镯取下递给凯蒂，看到凯蒂费了力气也戴不到手上，便噗地像孩子般地笑了。她对韦丁顿说了些什么，然后叫进来一个佣人，向佣人吩咐了几句。不一会儿佣人拿来了一双十分漂亮的满洲鞋子。">查看中文翻译</div>
