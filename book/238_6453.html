<div class="line_en">"Then why did you ask me to have some?" said Alice crossly. "It wasn't very polite of you."</div>

<div class="line_en">Alice was pleased. She enjoyed playing word games, so she said, "That's an easy question."</div>

<div class="line_en">There was a table under a tree outside the house, and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea. A Dormouse was sitting between them, asleep. The three of them were all sitting together at one corner of the table, but the table was large and there were many other seats. Alice sat down in a big chair at one end.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="房子外的树下有一张桌子，三月兔和制帽人正在喝茶。有只睡鼠在他们中间，睡着了。他们三个坐在桌子的一角，可桌子实际上很大，还有很多座位。爱丽丝在一头的一把大椅子上坐下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It wasn't very polite of you to sit down. We haven't invited you to tea," said the March Hare.</div>

<div class="line_en">Alice did not know what to say to this. So she took some tea and some bread and butter while she thought about it. The Dormouse woke up for a minute and then went to sleep again. After a while the Hatter took out his watch, shook it, then looked at it sadly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱丽丝对这些不知该说什么好。她一边思考这事儿，一边喝了点茶，吃了点黄油面包。睡鼠醒了一会儿又睡过去了。过了一会儿，制帽人掏出自己的手表，摇晃了一下，很伤心地看了又看。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It was the best butter," said the March Hare sadly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这是最好的黄油，”三月兔说，很是失望。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Alice suddenly understood. "Is that why there are all these cups and plates?" she said. "It's always tea-time here, and you go on moving round the table. Is that right? But what happens when you come to the beginning again?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱丽丝一下子明白了。“这就是为什么有杯子和盘子的原因吗？”她说。“这儿永远是喝茶的时间，你们就绕着桌子转。对不对？但你们回到开始后又会怎么样呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No, it isn't!" said the Hatter. "Listen to this. I see what I eat means one thing, but I eat what I see means something very different."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，不是！”制帽人说。“听着，我明白我吃什么是一件事，而我吃我看见的是另一回事，这是很不同的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I do," Alice said quickly. "Well, I mean what I say. And that's the same thing, you know."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“当然，”爱丽丝立刻说：“我说的就是我想的。你该知道，这是一样的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But we know the time," said the Hatter. "It's always six o'clock here."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可我们知道时间，”制帽人说。“在这儿永远是六点钟。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Then you must say what you mean," the March Hare said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那你得说你是怎么想的，”三月兔说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes," said Alice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，”爱丽丝说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Two days slow! I told you that butter wasn't good for watches!" he said angrily to the March Hare.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“慢了两天！我告诉过你，黄油对表没好处。”他气哼哼地对三月兔说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Alice was looking at the watch with interest. "It's a strange watch," she said. "It shows the day of the week, but not the time."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱丽丝好奇地看了看表。“这表真奇怪，”她说。“它只报星期几，不报时间。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"But I don't know any stories," said Alice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可是我什么故事也不知道，”爱丽丝说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes, please do," said Alice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“对，请讲个故事吧。”爱丽丝说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then the March Hare and the Hatter turned to the Dormouse. "Wake up, Dormouse!" they shouted loudly in its ears. "Tell us a story."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后三月兔和制帽人转向睡鼠。“醒醒，睡鼠！”他们冲着它的耳朵喊起来。“给我们讲个故事。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Dormouse woke up and quickly began to tell a story, but a few minutes later it was asleep again. The March Hare poured a little hot tea on its nose, and the Hatter began to look for a clean plate. Alice decided to leave and walked away into the wood. She looked back once, and the March Hare and the Hatter were trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="睡鼠醒了，马上开始讲故事。可过了几分钟，它又睡着了。三月兔把热茶倒在睡鼠的鼻子上，制帽人开始找一个干净的盘子。爱丽丝决定走，就进了小树林。她回头一看，三月兔和制帽人正想法子把睡鼠塞到茶壶里去呢。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Don't ask questions," said the March Hare crossly. "You must tell us a story now."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“别问来问去，”三月兔生气了。“你现在得给我们讲个故事。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, I won't go there again," said Alice. "What a stupid tea-party it was!" Just then she saw a door in one of the trees. "How curious!" she thought. "But everything is strange today. I think I'll go in."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我再也不到那儿去了。”爱丽丝说。“这茶会真愚蠢！”这时，她看见一棵树上有一扇门。“真奇怪！”她想。“今天什么事都很奇怪。我想我该进去。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So she went in. And there she was, back in the long room with the little glass table. At once, she picked up the gold key from the table, unlocked the little door into the garden, and then began to eat a piece of mushroom. When she was down to about thirty centimetres high, she walked through the door, and then, at last, she was in the beautiful garden with its green trees and bright flowers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是她走了进去。她又回到那个有张小玻璃桌的长的房间里。她马上从桌子上拿起那个小金钥匙，打开通往花园的门，再吃一片蘑菇。当自己缩小到差不多30厘米高时，她就穿过门，终于又到了那个美丽的花园，里面尽是绿树和亮丽的鲜花。">查看中文翻译</div>
