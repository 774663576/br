<div class="line_en">She shut the door behind her, surprised to find that she was frightened. For the whole of her life, she'd been wounded by her mother. She'd loved her as a child, inexplicably; hated her as a teenager; and ignored her as a woman. Cloud had broken her heart more times than she could count, and let her down on every possible occasion, and yet, even after all of that, Tully couldn't help feeling something for her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她进去，关上门，有些讶异地发现自己很害怕。这一生，她总是被母亲伤害。小时候她莫名其妙热爱妈妈，青春期恨她入骨，长大后则装作她不存在。白云让她伤心的次数多到数不清，无论大小事都只会让她失望，即便如此，塔莉依然对她有感情，她无法控制。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Hey, Cloud," Tully said, surprised to find that her throat was tight. She gently stroked her mother's temple, the only place on her face that wasn't bloodied or bruised. As she felt the velvety soft skin, she realized that the last time she'd touched her mother had been in 1970, when they'd held hands on that crowded Seattle street.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嘿，白云。”塔莉愕然发现喉咙有些紧缩。她轻抚妈妈的太阳穴，那是她脸上唯一没有流血或瘀血的部位。那柔嫩的肌肤让她想起，上一次触摸妈妈已经是1970年的事了，那时她们牵手走在拥挤的西雅图街头。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She wished she knew what to say to this woman, with whom she had a history but no present. So she just talked. She told her about the show and her life and how successful she'd become. When that started to sound hollow and desperate, she talked about Kate and their fight and how it had left her feeling so alone. As the words formed themselves and spilled out, Tully heard the truth in them. Losing the Ryans and Mularkeys had left her devastatingly alone. Cloud was all she had left. How pathetic was that?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她多么想知道该对眼前的人说什么，她们之间只有过去没有现在，于是她只好想到什么就说什么，她的节目、她的生活，以及她的成就。当这一切显得空洞凄凉，她换个话题说凯蒂的事，描述她们起冲突的经过，绝交之后她感到多么寂寞，当感受化作言语流出，塔莉听出了其中的真实。失去雷恩与穆勒齐两家人之后，她孑然一身。现在她的亲人只剩白云一个了，还真是可悲。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Tully stood there a long time, her hands curled around the metal bed rails. She knew her mother was pretending sleep; she also knew when it became real. When intermittent snores filled the silence, she went to the small closet in the room, found a folded-up blanket, and grabbed it. That was when she noticed the small pile of clothes folded neatly in the corner on the closet's bottom self. Beside it was a brown paper grocery bag, rolled closed at the top.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="塔莉站在原处很久，双手握着病床栏杆。她知道妈妈只是装睡，也知道她何时真的睡着了。断断续续的鼾声填满寂静的病房，她走向病房里的小衣柜，找到一条折好的毯子拿出来。这时，她发现柜子底层放着一小堆整齐折叠的衣物，旁边则是一个牛皮纸袋，袋口卷起来封住。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She wasn't sure why she went through her mother's things, what she was looking for. At first, it was the stuff she'd expected: dirty, worn clothes, shoes with holes along the soles, a makeshift toiletry set in a plastic baggie, cigarettes and a lighter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她也不晓得为什么要翻妈妈的东西，不知道自己想找什么。一开始都是些意料中的东西，破旧的脏衣物、底部磨出洞的鞋子、装在塑料袋里的几样盥洗用具、香烟和打火机。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The necklace Tully had made in her Bible study class and given to her mother on that day, so many years ago, when they'd left Gran's house in the VW bus. Her mother had kept it, all this time.</div>

<div class="line_en">Tully didn't touch it. She was afraid somehow that she'd find it existed only in her mind. She turned to her mother, went to the bed. "You kept it," she said, feeling something brand-new open up inside her. A kind of hope -- not the spit-shined little-girl variety, but something tarnished and worn; more reflective of who they were and where they'd been. Still, it was there, under all the rust and discoloration: hope. "You know how to hold on to a dream, too, don't you, Cloud?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="塔莉不敢碰，生怕只是幻觉。她回到病床旁。“你还留着。”她感觉内心某种全新的感受被开启了。一种希望，不是小时候那种无瑕璀璨的愿望，而是陈旧沧桑的希望，更能反映出她们是怎样的人、有过怎样的经历，即使人生锈蚀褪色，在底层依然藏着一缕希望，“白云，原来你也知道如何抓住梦想，对吧？”">查看中文翻译</div>

Her thighs had always been too fleshy, no matter how much weight she lost, and her tummy pooched out after three kids. She did sit-ups at the gym, but still her middle sagged. She'd stopped wearing sleeveless shirts about three years ago -- arm jiggle. And her breasts… Since the boys' births, she'd started wearing heavier-molded, less sexy bras, that was for sure, and she tightened the straps to pull her boobs into place.</div>

<div class="line_en">A few hours later, her family began to gather around her. The whole time they were together, having breakfast and packing their things into the car, she found herself glancing at the phone, expecting it to ring.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="几个小时后，家人开始聚集在她身边。他们一起吃早餐，收拾东西搬上车，整个过程中，她不时瞥向电话，希望铃声响起。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Story of my life," she said bitterly, tipping the doorman, who carried her bulky designer suitcases into the bedroom.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我人生的写照啊。”她苦涩自嘲，门房将她的名牌大行李箱搬进卧房，她打赏小费。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When she couldn't think of anything else to do for her family, she went to the window and watched the storm die. Slowly, the dewy world lightened. Charcoal clouds turned to a gorgeous pearlized pink. Seattle looked shiny and new, huddled as it was beneath the rising sun.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她再也想不到还能为家人做什么，于是走到窗前望着暴风雨转趋平息。朦胧的天地渐渐亮起，黑炭般的云朵变成漂亮的珠光粉红色调，旭日东升，拥挤的西雅图显得焕然一新。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When he left, she stood there, uncertain of what to do. It was nine o'clock on a Monday night, and most people were home with their families. Tomorrow, she'd go back to work and be able to lose herself in the daily routine of the empire she'd created. In no time at all she'd let go of the images that haunted her during the holidays, had even followed her to the ends of the earth last month. Literally. She'd spent Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year's in the frozen south, huddled around their heat source, singing songs and drinking wine. To the naked eye, and the ever-present camera, it had looked like a good time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="门房离开后，她站在家里，不晓得该做什么。现在是星期一晚上九点，大部分的人都在家团聚。明天就要回去上班了，她可以忙着打理她一手建造的帝国，埋首在日常工作中忘记寂寞。每逢佳节回忆总是缠着她不放，上个月甚至跟到了世界尽头，如假包换的天涯海角。感恩节、圣诞节与元旦她都在冰天雪地中度过，一群人围在热源旁唱歌喝酒。无论在一般人眼中或如影随形的镜头前，这样的画面都可谓欢乐温馨。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But too often when she'd crawled into her down sleeping bag, wearing her hat and mittens, and tried to sleep, she heard the old songs banging around in her head, making her cry. More than once she'd wakened with ice on her cheeks.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Great." Now she'd have no idea who had tried to call her after the outage. She hit the replay button and began the slow, arduous task of going through her messages. Halfway through, she made a note to speak to her assistant about voice mail.</div>
