<div class="line_en">There was no one with him that spring morning except his dearest friend, Jewel the Unicorn. They loved each other like brothers and each had saved the other's life in the wars. The lordly beast stood close beside the King's chair, with its neck bent round polishing its blue horn against the creamy whiteness of its flank.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那个春天的早晨，国王左右没有侍从，只有一个他最亲密的朋友：独角兽①珍宝。他们相亲相爱有如兄弟，在战争中互相救过彼此的性命。这贵族气派的野兽站在国王的御座近旁，把脖子弯过来，在奶油似的白色腹部擦亮它蓝色的角。（注：①独角兽，传说巾的怪兽，头和身体像马，后腿像牡鹿，尾巴像狮子，前额中都有个螺旋形独角。）">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">About three weeks later the last of the Kings of Narnia sat under the great oak which grew beside the door of his little hunting lodge, where he often stayed for ten days or so in the pleasant spring weather. It was a low, thatched building not far from the Eastern end of Lantern Waste and some way above the meeting of the two rivers. He loved to live there simply and at ease, away from the state and pomp of Cair Paravel, the royal city. His name was King Tirian, and he was between twenty and twenty-five years old; his shoulders were already broad and strong and his limbs full of hard muscle, but his beard was still scanty. He had blue eyes and a fearless, honest face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大约三个星期以后，纳尼亚王国的最后一位国王，坐在他小小的持猎屋门旁一棵大橡树底下。在赏心悦目的春季好天气里，他时常到守猎小屋来住上十天光景的。这是个茅草屋顶的低矮建筑物，离灯柱野林的东端不远，在两条河流交汇处稍稍上游一点儿。他喜欢住在那儿过简单朴素和逍遥自在的生活，远离王城凯尔帕拉维尔的政府和豪华气派。人们管他叫国王蒂莲，他的年龄在二十与二十五岁之间，他的肩膀已经宽阔而强壮了，他的四肢肌肉坚实，但他的胡子仍旧是稀稀拉拉的。他生着蓝蓝的眼睛和一张无所畏惧的诚实的脸。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"How can they choose but be true?" said the King. "It is more than a week ago that the first birds came flying over us saying, Aslan is here, Aslan has come to Narnia again. And after that it was the squirrels. They had not seen him, but they said it was certain he was in the woods. Then came the Stag. He said he had seen him with his own eyes, a great way off, by moonlight, in Lantern Waste. Then came that dark Man with the beard, the merchant from Calormen. The Calormenes care nothing for Aslan as we do; but the man spoke of it as a thing beyond doubt. And there was the Badger last night; he too had seen Aslan."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这些消息不能不是真实的啊！”国王说，“一个多星期以前，第一批飞过我们这里的鸟儿就说——阿斯兰来了，阿斯兰重新到纳尼亚来了。这之后是松鼠。它们没见到阿斯兰，可它们说阿斯兰肯定在树林里。然后是鹿。它说它亲眼看见阿斯兰了，距离很远，在月光下，在灯柱野林里。接着是黑皮肤的长着胡子的人来了，他是从卡乐门来的商人。卡乐门人跟我们不一样，他们对阿斯兰压根儿不关心；可那人也把阿斯兰来了说成是件毫无疑问的事实。昨儿夜里灌来了，它也看见过阿斯兰。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Indeed, Sire," answered Jewel, "I believe it all. If I seem not to, it is only that my joy is too great to let my belief settle itself. It is almost too beautiful to believe."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“陛下，事实上，”珍宝说道，“这种种新闻，我都相信。如果我仿佛不大相信，只是因为我心里的欢喜之情太大了，大得无从置信了。几乎是太美了，美得没法儿信以为真了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"A lie!" said the King fiercely. "What creature in Narnia or all the world would dare to lie on such a matter?" And, without knowing it, he laid his hand on his sword hilt.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“谎言！”国王情绪激烈地说道，在这么重大的事件上，纳尼亚王国或者全世界有什么人竟敢撒谎？他不知不觉地把自己的手按在剑柄上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Sire," he said. "You know how long I have lived and studied the stars; for we Centaurs live longer than you Men, and even longer than your kind, Unicorn. Never in all my days have I seen such terrible things written in the skies as there have been nightly since this year began. The stars say nothing of the coming of Aslan, nor of peace, nor of joy. I know by my art that there have not been such disastrous conjunctions of the planets for five hundred years. It was already in my mind to come and warn your Majesty that some great evil hangs over Narnia. But last night the rumour reached me that Aslan is abroad in Narnia. Sire, do not believe this tale. It cannot be. The stars never lie, but Men and Beasts do. If Aslan were really coming to Narnia the sky would have foretold it. If he were really come, all the most gracious stars would be assembled in his honour. It is all a lie."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“陛下，”他说道，“你知道我已经有多大年纪了，研究星相又有多久了；因为我们人头马比你们人类寿长，也比你们独角兽类寿长。在我以往的日子里，我从未像今年开始以来那样，夜夜见到写在星空里的那么可怕的不祥之兆。星相压根儿没有说到阿斯兰光临，既没有说到和平，也没有说到欢乐。我凭我的法术知道，五百年来没有出现过灾难性的’行星会合’现象。我脑子里已经有这么个想法，要来向陆下报警：有某种大灾大难笼罩着纳尼亚王国。但，昨天夜间我听到谣言，说是阿斯兰来临了。陛下，不要相信这种鬼话。这是不可能的。星象从不撒谎，但人和野兽都会撒谎的。如果阿斯兰已经来到纳尼亚王国，天上的星象便会有预兆了。如果狮王真的光临了，一切有礼貌的星星都会集拢来向狮王致敬的。这可是个彻头彻尾的谎言。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="龙威特刚抬起头来，正要向前伸过去跟国王十分认真地说话时，他们三个都转过头来谛听一个正愈传愈近的、号啕大哭的声音。他们西边的树林很稠密，所以他们还看不见新来的人物。但他们不久就能听清楚号哭的词儿了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">With the last "falling" the speaker came in sight. She was like a woman but so tall that her head was on a level with the Centaur's yet she was like a tree too. It is hard to explain if you have never seen a Dryad but quite unmistakable once you have -- something different in the colour, the voice, and the hair. King Tirian and the two Beasts knew at once that she was the nymph of a beech tree.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="随着最后一个“倒下”的声音，说话的人便看得见了。她像一个女人，但是高高大大，头跟人头马的脑袋一般儿高；然而她也很像个女人。如果你从未见过树精，那就很难给你解释；如果你见过，那就可以毫无错误地从颜色、声音、头发上辨别出来某些不同之处。国王蒂莲和两头野兽立刻就认出她是山毛榉的精灵。">查看中文翻译</div>

Her tree, miles away, had been cut down.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“啊——啊——啊——赫！”树精气喘吁吁地说道，她浑身发抖，仿佛疼痛万分——她一阵又一阵地发抖，仿佛再三受到打击似的。接着，在片刻之间她突然往斜刺里倒下去，倒像是她的双脚给砍掉了似的。国王他们看见她死了，躺在草地上短短一忽儿随即消失得无影无踪了。他们知道发生了。什么事。几英里之外，她那棵树木，被人砍倒了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="国王大踏步前进，有时喃喃自语，有时握紧拳头。珍宝在国王身旁行走，默默无言；因而他们之间没有什么别的声音，只有那挂在独角兽颈子里的粗大金链条的微弱的丁当声，人的两足踏步声，独角兽的四蹄唱唱声。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I will not wait the tenth part of a second," said the King. "But while Jewel and I go forward, do you gallop as hard as you may to Cair Paravel. Here is my ring for your token. Get me a score of men-at-arms, all well mounted, and a score of Talking Dogs, and ten Dwarfs (let them all be fell archers), and a Leopard or so, and Stonefoot the Giant. Bring all these after us as quickly as may be."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我十分之一秒钟也不愿等待，”国王说，“但，我和珍宝朝前赶去时，你就尽快直奔凯尔帕拉维尔。我这戒指给你作个凭证。给我调来二十个全副武装的、个个善于骑马的武士，二十头会说人话的狗儿，十个小矮人（须得个个是百发百中的弓箭手），一两只豹子，还有石足巨人。尽可能迅速地把这支队伍调来支援我们。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They soon reached the River and turned up it where there was a grassy road: they had the water on their left and the forest on their right. Soon after that they came to the place where the ground grew rougher and thick wood came down to the water's edge. The road, what there was of it, now ran on the Southern bank and they had to ford the River to reach it. It was up to Tirian's arm-pits, but Jewel (who had four legs and was therefore steadier) kept on his right so as to break the force of the current, and Tirian put his strong arm round the Unicorn's strong neck and they both got safely over. The King was still so angry that he hardly noticed the cold of the water. But of course he dried his sword very carefully on the shoulder of his cloak, which was the only dry part of him, as soon as they came to shore.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们不久就来到河流边上，他们经由一条芳草萋萋而上：现在他们的左边是河水，右边是树林。不久以后，他们走到一个地方，地面愈来愈高低不平，浓密的树林往下绵延到河水之滨。道路断了，道路的走向，现在跳到河水的南岸去了，他们不得不涉水渡河，才能走上对岸的道路。河水很深，漫到蒂莲的腋窝边，但珍宝有四条腿，因而比蒂莲站得稳，它在国王的右边坚持着，挡住了激流的冲击力量，蒂莲伸出他强壮的胳膊抱住独角兽强壮的脖子，他们俩安全渡过了河流。国王仍旧十分愤怒，没注意河水很冷。不过，他们刚登上南岸时，他当然十分仔细地在他外套的肩膀上擦干他的剑，这是他身上惟一没有浸湿的地方了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And so it was. Half a dozen splendid tree-trunks, all newly cut and newly lopped of their branches, had been lashed together to make a raft, and were gliding swiftly down the river. On the front of the raft there was a water rat with a pole to steer it.</div>

<div class="line_en">Before long they could hear the hack-hack-hack of axes falling on timber, though they could see nothing yet because there was a rise of the ground in front of them. When they had reached the top of it they could see right into Lantern Waste itself. And the King's face turned white when he saw it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="过了不久，他们便听到斧头乱劈乱砍木材的乒乒乓乓的声音，尽管由于前边土地隆起，他们还什么也看不见。及至他们到达隆起的高处，他们就能一览无遗地望见灯柱野林。国王看在眼里，气得脸都发白了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Right through the middle of that ancient forest -- that forest where the trees of gold and of silver had once grown and where a child from our world had once planted the Tree of Protection -- a broad lane had already been opened. It was a hideous lane like a raw gash in the land, full of muddy ruts where felled trees had been dragged down to the river. There was a great crowd of people at work, and a cracking of whips, and horses tugging and straining as they dragged at the logs. The first thing that struck the King and the Unicorn was that about half the people in the crowd were not Talking Beasts but Men. The next thing was that these men were not the fair-haired men of Narnia: they were dark, bearded men from Calormen, that great and cruel country that lies beyond Archenland across the desert to the south. There was no reason, of course, why one should not meet a Calormene or two in Narnia -- a merchant or an ambassador -- for there was peace between Narnia and Calormen in those days. But Tirian could notunderstand why there were so many of them: nor why they were cutting down a Narnian forest. He grasped his sword tighter and rolled his cloak round his left arm. They came quickly down among the men.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="贯穿古老的森林，已经开辟出了一条宽阔的通道。那可是一度生长过金树银树的森林，而我们这个世界里的一个孩子也曾在那儿种了一棵“保护之树”。这是一条叫人厌恶的通道，仿佛是土地上新裂开来的一道豁口，充满了树木拖到河边去时沿路留下的瘾迹。有一大群人在那儿干活，马鞭子嚼嚼啪啪地响，马儿拖动木头时拉拉扯扯，使出了九牛二虎之力。引起国王和独角兽注意的第一件事情是：人群中大半数都不是会说人话的马儿，倒是人。第二件事情是；这些人都不是金发白皮肤的纳尼亚人，他们都是来自卡乐门王国的黑皮肤大胡子大汉。卡乐门是个残酷的大国，位于阿钦兰背后、大沙漠之南。当然啦，没有理由不该在纳尼亚碰到一两个卡乐门人——个商人或是一个大使——因为在这些日子里，纳尼亚王国和卡乐门王国是和平相处的。然而蒂莲不明白，为什么竟有那么多的卡乐门人，现在他们为什么正在砍伐一片纳尼亚的森林。他紧握着他的剑，把他的外套卷在左臂上。他俩迅速来到这些人中间。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Up till now Tirian had taken it for granted that the horses which the Calormenes were driving were their own horses; dumb, witless animals like the horses of our own world. And though he hated to see even a dumb horse overdriven, he was of course thinking more about the murder of the Trees. It had never crossed his mind that anyone would dare to harness one of the free Talking Horses of Narnia, much less to use a whip on it. But as that savage blow fell the horse reared up and said, half screaming:</div>

<div class="line_en">When Tirian knew that the Horse was one of his own Narnians, there came over him and over Jewel such a rage that they did not know what they were doing. The King's sword went up, the Unicorn's horn went down. They rushed forward together. Next moment both the Calormenes lay dead, the one beheaded by Tirian's sword and the other gored through the heart by Jewel's horn.</div>
