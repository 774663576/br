<div class="line_en">But now another difficulty came upon me which I had never the least reason to expect. Mr. Meredith's father, who was to have paid for our printing-house, according to the expectations given me, was able to advance only one hundred pounds currency, which had been paid; and a hundred more was due to the merchant, who grew impatient, and su'd us all. We gave bail, but saw that, if the money could not be rais'd in time, the suit must soon come to a judgment and execution, and our hopeful prospects must, with us, be ruined, as the press and letters must be sold for payment, perhaps at half price.</div>

<div class="line_en">In this distress two true friends, whose kindness I have never forgotten, nor ever shall forget while I can remember any thing, came to me separately, unknown to each other, and, without any application from me, offering each of them to advance me all the money that should be necessary to enable me to take the whole business upon myself, if that should be practicable; but they did not like my continuing the partnership with Meredith, who, as they said, was often seen drunk in the streets, and playing at low games in alehouses, much to our discredit. These two friends were William Coleman and Robert Grace. I told them I could not propose a separation while any prospect remain'd of the Merediths' fulfilling their part of our agreement, because I thought myself under great obligations to them for what they had done, and would do if they could; but, if they finally fail'd in their performance, and our partnership must be dissolv'd, I should then think myself at liberty to accept the assistance of my friends.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在这种不幸之际却来了两个真正的朋友，他们的友情我从来也没有忘记，而且在毕生中将永志不忘。他们各人分别地不约而同地并且自动地愿意为我垫付一切必需的款项，使我能够自己单独经营业务，假如办得到的话。但是他们不喜欢我和梅莱笛斯继续合伙，他们说有人常看见梅莱笛斯喝醉了酒在街上行走；也有人看见他在酒馆里玩下流的赌博，这些对我都是奇耻大辱。这两位朋友是威廉·柯尔曼和劳勃脱·葛莱丝。我告诉他们只要还有希望梅莱笛斯父子能够履行他们在协定中的义务，我就不忍提议拆伙，因为我觉得他们过去帮了我不少忙，如果他们有能力的话，他们现在还将帮我忙，我受过了他们不少的恩惠。但是假如他们终于不能履行他们的义务，因而我们的合伙势非解散不可的话，到了那时我将认为我可以随意接受我友人们的协助了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mr. Vernon, about this time, put me in mind of the debt I ow'd him, but did not press me. I wrote him an ingenuous letter of acknowledgment, crav'd his forbearance a little longer, which he allow'd me, and as soon as I was able, I paid the principal with interest, and many thanks; so that erratum was in some degree corrected.</div>

<div class="line_en">Thus the matter rested for some time, when I said to my partner, "Perhaps your father is dissatisfied at the part you have undertaken in this affair of ours, and is unwilling to advance for you and me what he would for you alone. If that is the case, tell me, and I will resign the whole to you, and go about my business." "No," said he, "my father has really been disappointed, and is really unable; and I am unwilling to distress him farther. I see this is a business I am not fit for. I was bred a farmer, and it was a folly in me to come to town, and put myself, at thirty years of age, an apprentice to learn a new trade. Many of our Welsh people are going to settle in North Carolina, where land is cheap. I am inclin'd to go with them, and follow my old employment. You may find friends to assist you. If you will take the debts of the company upon you; return to my father the hundred pound he has advanced; pay my little personal debts, and give me thirty pounds and a new saddle, I will relinquish the partnership, and leave the whole in your hands." I agreed to this proposal: it was drawn up in writing, sign'd, and seal'd immediately. I gave him what he demanded, and he went soon after to Carolina, from whence he sent me next year two long letters, containing the best account that had been given of that country, the climate, the soil, husbandry, etc., for in those matters he was very judicious. I printed them in the papers, and they gave great satisfaction to the publick.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="事情就这样拖了一个时候，我就对我的伙友说：“可能你父亲不喜欢你参加我的事业，因此他不愿替我们两人垫付款项，但是他可能却愿意替你一人出钱。假如是这样的话，请你告诉我，我将退出合伙，离开此地。”“不，”他说，“我父亲倒是真正的感到失望的，他是真正无力垫付款项，同时我也不愿意更使他痛心。我现在知道我不能胜任这个印刷工作。我从小就学农，我的进城来，在三十岁的年龄，充当学徒去学习一种新的行业，实在是一件荒唐事。我们有很多威尔斯人将到北卡罗来纳去殖民，因为那里土地很便宜。我想跟他们一块儿去干我的老行业。你可以找朋友来帮助你，假如你愿意承担印刷所的债务，归还我父亲所垫的一百镑，替我还清我个人的一些零星欠款，再给我三十镑和一个新的马鞍，我将让与我的股权。全部产权归你所有。”我同意他的提议。我们马上就写了一张证书，签了字盖了印。我给了他他所要求的东西，不久他就到卡罗来纳去了，第二年他从那里寄了两封长信给我，信里包含了关于那一地区到那时为止最好的一篇叙述，讲到它的气候、土壤、农业等。因为关于这些事情他原是十分内行的。我把它们在报上发表了，读者大为满意。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">About this time there was a cry among the people for more paper money, only fifteen thousand pounds being extant in the province, and that soon to be sunk. The wealthy inhabitants oppos'd any addition, being against all paper currency, from an apprehension that it would depreciate, as it had done in New England, to the prejudice of all creditors. We had discuss'd this point in our Junto, where I was on the side of an addition, being persuaded that the first small sum struck in 1723 had done much good by increasing the trade, employment, and number of inhabitants in the province, since I now saw all the old houses inhabited, and many new ones building; whereas I remembered well, that when I first walk'd about the streets of Philadelphia, eating my roll, I saw most of the houses in Walnut-street, between Second and Front streets, with bills on their doors, "To be let"; and many likewise in Chestnut-street and other streets, which made me then think the inhabitants of the city were deserting it one after another.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="约在这时候，在人民中间有一种要求发行更多纸币的呼声，当时宾夕法尼亚的纸币流通额只有一万五千镑，就是这一数目不久也将要减少。富裕阶层反对增添纸币，他们反对一切纸币，由于他们害怕纸币会使货币贬值，像在新英格兰发生的那样，致使债权人处于不利地位。我们在我们的“密社”中曾经讨论过这一个问题。当时我赞成增发纸币，因为我相信一七二三年所铸造的小量货币做了不少好事，它促进了商业和就业，增加了本州的居民，因为我现在看到所有的老房子都住满了人，许多新房子在建筑中，但是我记得很清楚，当我首次吃着我的面包卷走在费城街上的时候，我看见在胡桃街从第二街到前街这一段街道上的大多数房屋都在门上贴着招租条子，在板栗街和其他街道上的许多房屋也是如此。这种情形当时使我以为费城的居民正在不断地离开这一城市哩。">查看中文翻译</div>

I think this was in or about the year 1729.</div>

<div class="line_en">The utility of this currency became by time and experience so evident as never afterwards to be much disputed; so that it grew soon to fifty-five thousand pounds, and in 1739 to eighty thousand pounds, since which it arose during war to upwards of three hundred and fifty thousand pounds, trade, building, and inhabitants all the while increasing, till I now think there are limits beyond which the quantity may be hurtful.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="经过时间和经验的考验，纸币的效用变得十分明显，以后就没有引起很多的争辩。结果，不久纸币发行额就达到了五千镑，一七三九年到了八万镑，以后在战争期间超过了三十五万镑，因为商业、建筑和居民的人数都在不断地增多。虽然现在我想纸币发行额有一限度，过了这一限度就可能有害了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Our debates possess'd me so fully of the subject, that I wrote and printed an anonymous pamphlet on it, entitled "The Nature and Necessity of a Paper Currency." It was well receiv'd by the common people in general; but the rich men dislik'd it, for it increas'd and strengthen'd the clamor for more money, and they happening to have no writers among them that were able to answer it, their opposition slacken'd, and the point was carried by a majority in the House. My friends there, who conceiv'd I had been of some service, thought fit to reward me by employing me in printing the money; a very profitable jobb and a great help to me. This was another advantage gain'd by my being able to write.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们的辩论使我对于这一题目感到很大的兴趣，甚至我撰写和发表了一本不具名的小册子，名为《纸币的性质和需要》。普通的百姓很欢迎它，但是有钱人不喜欢它，因为它增大和加强了增加货币的呼喊。碰巧在富人这边他们没有作家能够回答这一小册子，因此他们的反抗减弱了。这样，增发纸币这一议案就在州议会中以大多数通过了。我在州议会中的朋友们想到我对这一议案的通过有些贡献，认为应当由我来承印纸币，作为酬答。这是一宗利润很厚的生意，对我帮助很大。这是我会写文章的又一个好处。">查看中文翻译</div>

He procured for me, also, the printing of the laws and votes of that government, which continu'd in my hands as long as I follow'd the business.</div>

<div class="line_en">I began now gradually to pay off the debt I was under for the printing-house. In order to secure my credit and character as a tradesman, I took care not only to be in reality industrious and frugal, but to avoid all appearances to the contrary. I drest plainly; I was seen at no places of idle diversion. I never went out a fishing or shooting; a book, indeed, sometimes debauch'd me from my work, but that was seldom, snug, and gave no scandal; and, to show that I was not above my business, I sometimes brought home the paper I purchas'd at the stores thro' the streets on a wheelbarrow. Thus being esteem'd an industrious, thriving young man, and paying duly for what I bought, the merchants who imported stationery solicited my custom; others proposed supplying me with books, and I went on swimmingly. In the mean time, Keimer's credit and business declining daily, he was at last forc'd to sell his printing house to satisfy his creditors. He went to Barbadoes, and there lived some years in very poor circumstances.</div>

<div class="line_en">His apprentice, David Harry, whom I had instructed while I work'd with him, set up in his place at Philadelphia, having bought his materials. I was at first apprehensive of a powerful rival in Harry, as his friends were very able, and had a good deal of interest. I therefore propos'd a partnership to him which he, fortunately for me, rejected with scorn. He was very proud, dress'd like a gentleman, liv'd expensively, took much diversion and pleasure abroad, ran in debt, and neglected his business; upon which, all business left him; and, finding nothing to do, he followed Keimer to Barbadoes, taking the printing-house with him. There this apprentice employ'd his former master as a journeyman; they quarrel'd often; Harry went continually behindhand, and at length was forc'd to sell his types and return to his country work in Pensilvania. The person that bought them employ'd Keimer to use them, but in a few years he died.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的学徒大卫·哈利，当我在凯谋铺子里工作时，我曾经教导过他。这时候，在购买了凯谋的设备以后，顶替了他的地位开张了。起初，我怕哈利是一个强有力的竞争者，因为他的亲友们很有能力，也很有势力。因此，我提议跟他合伙经营，但是幸亏他轻蔑地拒绝了我。他十分骄傲自大，穿着上流人的服装，生活奢侈，常在外面寻求消遣和快乐，负了债，旷废了他的业务。因此，一切生意都跑了。既然没有生意可做，他学了凯谋的样，到巴巴多群岛去了，把印刷铺也搬了去。在那里这位学徒雇用了他过去的老板作为一个职工。他们时常争吵。哈利负债越来越多了，最后他不得不把他的铅字出卖，回到宾夕法尼亚务农去了。购买印刷铺设备的人雇用了凯谋来使用这些设备，但是几年以后凯谋就死了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There remained now no competitor with me at Philadelphia but the old one, Bradford; who was rich and easy, did a little printing now and then by straggling hands, but was not very anxious about the business. However, as he kept the post-office, it was imagined he had better opportunities of obtaining news; his paper was thought a better distributer of advertisements than mine, and therefore had many, more, which was a profitable thing to him, and a disadvantage to me; for, tho' I did indeed receive and send papers by the post, yet the publick opinion was otherwise, for what I did send was by bribing the riders, who took them privately, Bradford being unkind enough to forbid it, which occasion'd some resentment on my part; and I thought so meanly of him for it, that, when I afterward came into his situation, I took care never to imitate it.</div>

Mrs. Godfrey projected a match for me with a relation's daughter, took opportunities of bringing us often together, till a serious courtship on my part ensu'd, the girl being in herself very deserving. The old folks encourag'd me by continual invitations to supper, and by leaving us together, till at length it was time to explain. Mrs. Godfrey manag'd our little treaty. I let her know that I expected as much money with their daughter as would pay off my remaining debt for the printing-house, which I believe was not then above a hundred pounds. She brought me word they had no such sum to spare; I said they might mortgage their house in the loan-office. The answer to this, after some days, was, that they did not approve the match; that, on inquiry of Bradford, they had been inform'd the printing business was not a profitable one; the types would soon be worn out, and more wanted; that S. Keimer and D. Harry had failed one after the other, and I should probably soon follow them; and, therefore, I was forbidden the house, and the daughter shut up.</div>

<div class="line_en">A friendly correspondence as neighbors and old acquaintances had continued between me and Mrs. Read's family, who all had a regard for me from the time of my first lodging in their house. I was often invited there and consulted in their affairs, wherein I sometimes was of service. I piti'd poor Miss Read's unfortunate situation, who was generally dejected, seldom cheerful, and avoided company. I considered my giddiness and inconstancy when in London as in a great degree the cause of her unhappiness, tho' the mother was good enough to think the fault more her own than mine, as she had prevented our marrying before I went thither, and persuaded the other match in my absence. Our mutual affection was revived, but there were now great objections to our union. The match was indeed looked upon as invalid, a preceding wife being said to be living in England; but this could not easily be prov'd, because of the distance; and, tho' there was a report of his death, it was not certain. Then, tho' it should be true, he had left many debts, which his successor might be call'd upon to pay. We ventured, however, over all these difficulties, and I took her to wife, September 1st, 1730.</div>

<div class="line_en">About this time, our club meeting, not at a tavern, but in a little room of Mr. Grace's, set apart for that purpose, a proposition was made by me, that, since our books were often referr'd to in our disquisitions upon the queries, it might be convenient to us to have them altogether where we met, that upon occasion they might be consulted; and by thus clubbing our books to a common library, we should, while we lik'd to keep them together, have each of us the advantage of using the books of all the other members, which would be nearly as beneficial as if each owned the whole. It was lik'd and agreed to, and we fill'd one end of the room with such books as we could best spare. The number was not so great as we expected; and tho' they had been of great use, yet some inconveniences occurring for want of due care of them, the collection, after about a year, was separated, and each took his books home again</div>

I drew up the proposals, got them put into form by our great scrivener, Brockden, and, by the help of my friends in the Junto, procured fifty subscribers of forty shillings each to begin with, and ten shillings a year for fifty years, the term our company was to continue. We afterwards obtain'd a charter, the company being increased to one hundred: this was the mother of all the North American subscription libraries, now so numerous. It is become a great thing itself, and continually increasing.

<div class="line_en">"Some time since there fell into my hands, to my great joy, about twenty-three sheets in thy own handwriting, containing an account of the parentage and life of thyself, directed to thy son, ending in the year 1730, with which there were notes, likewise in thy writing; a copy of which I inclose, in hopes it may be a means, if thou continued it up to a later period, that the first and latter part may be put together; and if it is not yet continued, I hope thee will not delay it. Life is uncertain, as the preacher tells us; and what will the world say if kind, humane, and benevolent Ben. Franklin should leave his friends and the world deprived of so pleasing and profitable a work; a work which would be useful and entertaining not only to a few, but to millions? The influence writings under that class have on the minds of youth is very great, and has nowhere appeared to me so plain, as in our public friend's journals. It almost insensibly leads the youth into the resolution of endeavoring to become as good and eminent as the journalist. Should thine, for instance, when published (and I think it could not fail of it), lead the youth to equal the industry and temperance of thy early youth, what a blessing with that class would such a work be! I know of no character living, nor many of them put together, who has so much in his power as thyself to promote a greater spirit of industry and early attention to business, frugality, and temperance with the American youth. Not that I think the work would have no other merit and use in the world, far from it; but the first is of such vast importance that I know nothing that can equal it."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="我把上面的这封信和它的附件记录给一个朋友看了以后，我收到他下面这封信。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"My DEAREST SIR: When I had read over your sheets of minutes of the principal incidents of your life, recovered for you by your Quaker acquaintance, I told you I would send you a letter expressing my reasons why I thought it would be useful to complete and publish it as he desired. Various concerns have for some time past prevented this letter being written, and I do not know whether it was worth any expectation; happening to be at leisure, however, at present, I shall by writing, at least interest and instruct myself; but as the terms I am inclined to use may tend to offend a person of your manners, I shall only tell you how I would address any other person, who was as good and as great as yourself, but less diffident. I would say to him, Sir, I solicit the history of your life from the following motives: Your history is so remarkable, that if you do not give it, somebody else will certainly give it; and perhaps so as nearly to do as much harm, as your own management of the thing might do good. It will moreover present a table of the internal circumstances of your country, which will very much tend to invite to it settlers of virtuous and manly minds. And considering the eagerness with which such information is sought by them, and the extent of your reputation, I do not know of a more efficacious advertisement than your biography would give. All that has happened to you is also connected with the detail of the manners and situation of a rising people; and in this respect I do not think that the writings of Caesar and Tacitus can be more interesting to a true judge of human nature and society. But these, sir, are small reasons, in my opinion, compared with the chance which your life will give for the forming of future great men; and in conjunction with your Art of Virtue (which you design to publish) of improving the features of private character, and consequently of aiding all happiness, both public and domestic. The two works I allude to, sir, will in particular give a noble rule and example of self-education. School and other education constantly proceed upon false principles, and show a clumsy apparatus pointed at a false mark; but your apparatus is simple, and the mark a true one; and while parents and young persons are left destitute of other just means of estimating and becoming prepared for a reasonable course in life, your discovery that the thing is in many a man's private power, will be invaluable! Influence upon the private character, late in life, is not only an influence late in life, but a weak influence. It is in youth that we plant our chief habits and prejudices; it is in youth that we take our party as to profession, pursuits and matrimony. In youth, therefore, the turn is given; in youth the education even of the next generation is given; in youth the private and public character is determined; and the term of life extending but from youth to age, life ought to begin well from youth, and more especially before we take our party as to our principal objects. But your biography will not merely teach self-education, but the education of a wise man; and the wisest man will receive lights and improve his progress, by seeing detailed the conduct of another wise man. And why are weaker men to be deprived of such helps, when we see our race has been blundering on in the dark, almost without a guide in this particular, from the farthest trace of time? Show then, sir, how much is to be done, both to sons and fathers; and invite all wise men to become like yourself, and other men to become wise. When we see how cruel statesmen and warriors can be to the human race, and how absurd distinguished men can be to their acquaintance, it will be instructive to observe the instances multiply of pacific, acquiescing manners; and to find how compatible it is to be great and domestic, enviable and yet good-humored.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当我读完了您的教友会友人替您找到的记载着您一生中主要事迹的笔记以后，我曾经告诉过您我将写给您一封信，说明我的理由，为什么我认为假如您能依照他的要求把它写完并且发表出来，那将是一桩有益的事。过去一些时候因为各种事务羁身，没有功夫写这封信，同时我也不知道究竟这信是否值得对它寄与任何期望。但是目前我碰巧有空，我将把它写出来，至少可以使我自己感到兴趣并且获得教益。但是由于我想用的措辞或许会触犯像您这样的人，所以我将只告诉您，假如我对另外一个像您一样善良和伟大，但是不像您那样谦逊的人写信，我将说什么，我将对他说：先生，我恳请您发表您自传的理由如下：您的一生是如此的出类拔俗，假如您自己不写，别人一定会编写您的传记，与其由别人来写，造成许多危害，不如由您自己来主持有益得多，并且您的自传能够介绍贵国内部的情况，它一定会吸引善良勇敢的人们移居到贵国来。照这些移民对于这种报道的迫切需要而论，就您的声望来讲，我想不出比您的自传更有效的广告了。您的毕生经历也是与一个蒸蒸日上的民族的一切风土人情和情况分不开的。从这个角度看来，我认为您的自传的重要性，对于一个真正研究风土人情和人类社会的学者说来，不亚于凯撒和塔西佗的著作。但是在我看来，先生，这些理由是微不足道的，若是跟您的自传对未来伟大人物的形成，与您打算发表的“道德的艺术”一起对私人道德的改善，因而对公共和家庭幸福的促进可能发生的影响相比的话。上述两部作品，先生，特别会成为自学的崇高法则和典型。学校教育和其他教育制度常常按照不正确的原则进行教学，透露出一套指向着错误目标的笨拙方法。但是您的方法既简单，目标又正确。正当家长们和年轻人因找不到其他恰当的方法而感到彷徨失措，不知道对未来一生中合理的道路方向当如何进行估计和准备时，您发现了主要的东西是许多人的力量所能及的。这一发现是多么珍贵呀！对于一个人后期私人品德的影响，不但是来之过晚，而且效力薄弱。我们是在青年时期形成我们主要的习惯和好恶的，我们是在青年时期选择我们的工作、职业和配偶的。因此，青年时期是一个转捩点。在青年时期甚至形成了下一代的教育。在青年时期决定了一个人的私德和公德。由于人的一生只限于从青年到晚年这一时期，我们就应该好好地从青年时期开始，特别是在我们决定我们的主要目标之前。但是您的自传不仅仅能教人自学，它并且能教人如何成为一个智者。即使最明智的人，在看到了另一个智者一举一动的详细报道以后，也能获得智慧，改进自己的进度。我们看到人类从远古以来，一直在暗中摸索，在这方面几乎连一个指路人也没有，那么为什么智力较软弱的人就应当被剥夺这种帮助呢？因此先生，把当做的事指示给父亲们和儿子们看，帮助一切智者成为像您自己一样的人，也帮助其他人成为明智之士。当我们看到政治家和军人能够对人类变成如何地残酷，著名人士又是能够如何逆情背理地对待自己的朋友时，看到温和顺服的风气的增长；看到伟大和善于治家、令人羡妒的品德和和蔼可亲的作风能够共存于一身，是对人有益的。">查看中文翻译</div>

It will be so far a sort of key to life, and explain many things that all men ought to have once explained to them, to give, them a chance of becoming wise by foresight. The nearest thing to having experience of one's own, is to have other people's affairs brought before us in a shape that is interesting; this is sure to happen from your pen; our affairs and management will have an air of simplicity or importance that will not fail to strike; and I am convinced you have conducted them with as much originality as if you had been conducting discussions in politics or philosophy; and what more worthy of experiments and system (its importance and its errors considered) than human life?</div>

<div class="line_en">"Some men have been virtuous blindly, others have speculated fantastically, and others have been shrewd to bad purposes; but you, sir, I am sure, will give under your hand, nothing but what is at the same moment, wise, practical and good, your account of yourself (for I suppose the parallel I am drawing for Dr. Franklin, will hold not only in point of character, but of private history) will show that you are ashamed of no origin; a thing the more important, as you prove how little necessary all origin is to happiness, virtue, or greatness. As no end likewise happens without a means, so we shall find, sir, that even you yourself framed a plan by which you became considerable; but at the same time we may see that though the event is flattering, the means are as simple as wisdom could make them; that is, depending upon nature, virtue, thought and habit. Another thing demonstrated will be the propriety of everyman's waiting for his time for appearing upon the stage of the world. Our sensations being very much fixed to the moment, we are apt to forget that more moments are to follow the first, and consequently that man should arrange his conduct so as to suit the whole of a life. Your attribution appears to have been applied to your life, and the passing moments of it have been enlivened with content and enjoyment instead of being tormented with foolish impatience or regrets. Such a conduct is easy for those who make virtue and themselves in countenance by examples of other truly great men, of whom patience is so often the characteristic. Your Quaker correspondent, sir (for here again I will suppose the subject of my letter resembling Dr. Franklin), praised your frugality, diligence and temperance, which he considered as a pattern for all youth; but it is singular that he should have forgotten your modesty and your disinterestedness, without which you never could have waited for your advancement, or found your situation in the mean time comfortable; which is a strong lesson to show the poverty of glory and the importance of regulating our minds. If this correspondent had known the nature of your reputation as well as I do, he would have said, Your former writings and measures would secure attention to your Biography, and Art of Virtue; and your Biography and Art of Virtue, in return, would secure attention to them. This is an advantage attendant upon a various character, and which brings all that belongs to it into greater play; and it is the more useful, as perhaps more persons are at a loss for the means of improving their minds and characters, than they are for the time or the inclination to do it. But there is one concluding reflection, sir, that will shew the use of your life as a mere piece of biography. This style of writing seems a little gone out of vogue, and yet it is a very useful one; and your specimen of it may be particularly serviceable, as it will make a subject of comparison with the lives of various public cutthroats and intriguers, and with absurd monastic self-tormentors or vain literary triflers. If it encourages more writings of the same kind with your own, and induces more men to spend lives fit to be written, it will be worth all Plutarch's Lives put together. But being tired of figuring to myself a character of which every feature suits only one man in the world, without giving him the praise of it, I shall end my letter, my dear Dr. Franklin, with a personal application to your proper self. I am earnestly desirous, then, my dear sir, that you should let the world into the traits of your genuine character, as civil broils nay otherwise tend to disguise or traduce it. Considering your great age, the caution of your character, and your peculiar style of thinking, it is not likely that any one besides yourself can be sufficiently master of the facts of your life, or the intentions of your mind. Besides all this, the immense revolution of the present period, will necessarily turn our attention towards the author of it, and when virtuous principles have been pretended in it, it will be highly important to shew that such have really influenced; and, as your own character will be the principal one to receive a scrutiny, it is proper (even for its effects upon your vast and rising country, as well as upon England and upon Europe) that it should stand respectable and eternal. For the furtherance of human happiness, I have always maintained that it is necessary to prove that man is not even at present a vicious and detestable animal; and still more to prove that good management may greatly amend him; and it is for much the same reason, that I am anxious to see the opinion established, that there are fair characters existing among the individuals of the race; for the moment that all men, without exception, shall be conceived abandoned, good people will cease efforts deemed to be hopeless, and perhaps think of taking their share in the scramble of life, or at least of making it comfortable principally for themselves. Take then, my dear sir, this work most speedily into hand: shew yourself good as you are good; temperate as you are temperate; and above all things, prove yourself as one, who from your infancy have loved justice, liberty and concord, in a way that has made it natural and consistent for you to have acted, as we have seen you act in the last seventeen years of your life. Let Englishmen be made not only to respect, but even to love you. When they think well of individuals in your native country, they will go nearer to thinking well of your country; and when your countrymen see themselves well thought of by Englishmen, they will go nearer to thinking well of England. Extend your views even further; do not stop at those who speak the English tongue, but after having settled so many points in nature and politics, think of bettering the whole race of men. As I have not read any part of the life in question, but know only the character that lived it, I write somewhat at hazard. I am sure, however, that the life and the treatise I allude to (on the Art of Virtue) will necessarily fulfil the chief of my expectations; and still more so if you take up the measure of suiting these performances to the several views above stated. Should they even prove unsuccessful in all that a sanguine admirer of yours hopes from them, you will at least have framed pieces to interest the human mind; and whoever gives a feeling of pleasure that is innocent to man, has added so much to the fair side of a life otherwise too much darkened by anxiety and too much injured by pain. In the hope, therefore, that you will listen to the prayer addressed to you in this letter, I beg to subscribe myself, my dearest sir, etc., etc.,</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有些人是盲目地善良，有的是异想天开地胡思乱猜，另外还有些人是别有用心地邪恶不纯，但是，先生，我深信您所写的必然是同时又明智、又实用、又善良的东西。您的自传（因为我想我正在描述的这个与富兰克林博士相类似的人，不但在品德方面与您相似，而且在私人经历方面也是一样的）将要表明您不以出身为可耻。这一点尤其显得重要，由于您证明了高贵的出身对于快乐、美德或是伟大是多么的不必要。但是要达到一个目的也不能没有具体的方法，所以我们将看到，先生，连您自己也制订了一个使您成为要人的方案。但是同时我们可以看到，虽然结局是美好的，实现这个计划的手段却是人类智慧所能设想的最简单的手段，那就是：依靠本性、德行、思考和习惯。在自传中证明的另一点是：每人应当等待适当时机登上世界舞台。由于我们的感觉集中在目前，我们往往容易忘记以后还有时日，所以人应当安排他的行动以适应整个一生。您的成功看来当归功于您的一生，您使得您生命中转瞬即逝的片刻充满着知足和快乐因而显得生动活泼，而不是使它因愚蠢的急躁或懊恨而受到折磨，对于那些仿效真正伟大人物而增进自己修养的人，这种做人方法原是容易的，因为忍耐往往就是这些伟人们的特色。您的教友会的通信者，先生（因为这里我又假定我信中的主人翁与富兰克林博士相似），赞扬您的朴实、勤劳和节制，认为足为青年的榜样。但是奇怪的是他竟忘了您的谦逊和大公无私。假如没有这些，您就绝对不可能耐心地等候您发迹的机会，也不可能在其间安贫若饴，处之泰然。这是一个强有力的教训，说明荣誉的虚空和控制我们思想的重要性。假如这位通信者能够像我这样地了解您的声誉的性质，他就会说：您以前所写的论文和您提出的议案会使人注意您的自传和“道德的艺术”。反过来，您的自传和“道德的艺术”会使人注意到您的论文和议案。这就是一个具有多样化的人的优点，这种身份更能充分地利用它所包含的一切。这样您的自传将更加有用，因为不懂得如何改进自己的思想和品德的人或许比没有时间或志趣去从事这种工作的人来得多。但是最后还有一个感想，先生，说明作为一篇传记您的自传有什么用途。自传这一式样现在好像有点不时髦了，但是它是非常有用处的。您的范本也许特别有用，因为它可以用来与许多社会上知名的暴徒和陰谋家的传记比较，也可以用来与那些逆情悖理僧院式的苦行者或是自以为了不起的无聊文人的传记相比。假如您的自传能够鼓励人家写出更多的这类作品，并且诱导人们使他们的处世为人能见得天日写入传记，那么它的价值将不下于普鲁泰克的全部传记合在一起。但是因为我已经厌倦于想象这样的一个人，他的每一特点只能适合于世界上的某一个人，这种特点也不能使我们对他歌颂，我将在结束这封信之前，我亲爱的富兰克林博士：向您本人提出一个私人的恳求。因此，我恳切地希望，我亲爱的先生，您能让世人了解您真实个性的特点，因为否则政治上的争论或许会掩盖或是诋毁您个性的庐山真面目了。考虑到您的高龄，您生性的谨慎小心，和您思考事物的特殊风格，除了您自己以外大概不大可能有人能够对您的一生或是对您的思想动机有充分的了解。除此以外，目前的巨大革命将必然使我们的注意力转向革命的首创者。因为革命既然号称是为了某些道德的原则，那么指出这些原则如何真正地影响了革命，就变成十分重要了。因为您自己的品德将是受到彻查的主要对象，您的品行就应当是（即使是为了对您那巨大的蒸蒸日上的国家和对英国和欧洲的影响）规矩端正，流芳百世。为了增进人类的幸福，我一向以为我们不仅必须证明人类在目前是一种品行恶劣、惹人厌恶的动物，而且更必须证明正确地处理人生可以大大地改变人的本性。为了类似的理由，我很想使大家公认，在人类社会里个别的人还是具有高尚的品德的，因为假如一旦我们认为所有人毫无例外地都是不可救药的，那么善良的人们将会放弃被认为是无用的努力，或许只想到在人世间你抢我夺的纷争中分得一杯羹，或是至少只是主要想到使他们自己舒适而已。那么，我亲爱的先生，赶快动手写吧，显示出您是善良的，因为您确是这样，显示出您是稳健的，因为您确是如此，最要紧的是证明您自己是一个从小就酷爱正义、自由和和谐的人，这种信仰使您自然而然地一贯地像我们在您最近的十七年中看到您的行事一样。但愿您使得英国人不但尊敬您，并且甚至爱慕您。当英国人尊敬贵国个别的国民时，他们也就会逐渐地尊敬贵国了。当贵国人民看到他们自己受到英国人的尊敬时，他们也就会逐渐地看得起英国了。甚至把您的目光放得更远一些，不要局限于说英语的人民。您在解决了关于人性和政治的这么多的问题以后，您就当设法改进全人类了。由于我未曾读过这部自传的任何部分，我只认识自传的主人翁，所以我有点胡言乱语。但是我相信我提及的自传和关于道德的艺术的论文必然会满足我主要的期望。假如您能采纳上述的一些意见，那就更合我的期望了。即使退一步讲，这些作品不能满足您的热烈的赞扬者所寄与的希望，至少您已经写出了两部有趣味的作品。一个人能够给人们一种纯洁的快感，那他就大大地增进了人生的幸福，人的生命本来就有着过多的焦虑和痛苦。因此，我希望您能倾听我在这里提出的恳求，即此等等。">查看中文翻译</div>
