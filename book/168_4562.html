<div class="line_en">Jaime sat silent through it all, letting the words wash over him, a horn of ale forgotten in his one good hand. Joffrey. My blood. My firstborn. My son. He tried to bring the boy's face to mind, but his features kept turning into Cersei's. She will be in mourning, her hair in disarray and her eyes red from crying, her mouth trembling as she tries to speak. She will cry again when she sees me, though she'll fight the tears. His sister seldom wept but when she was with him. She could not stand for others to think her weak. Only to her twin did she show her wounds. She will look to me for comfort and revenge.</div>

<div class="line_en">Jaime had seen him born, that was true, though more for Cersei than the child. But he had never held him. "How would it look?" his sister warned him when the women finally left them. "Bad enough Joff looks like you without you mooning over him." Jaime yielded with hardly a fight. The boy had been a squalling pink thing who demanded too much of Cersei's time, Cersei's love, and Cersei's breasts. Robert was welcome to him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没错，詹姆看着他降生，但主要关心的不是他，是瑟曦…而这一辈子，他没有哪怕一次机会抱抱孩子。“那怎么成？”当他提出要求时，姐姐如此警告，“你和小乔长得这么像，已经够危险了。”听罢此言，詹姆只好默不作声地放弃，从此以后，这个孩子，这个尖叫着的粉红小东西，占去了瑟曦的时间、她的爱和她的胸乳。他也一度成为劳勃的宠儿。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He turned abruptly and galloped back to find Brienne. Gods know why I bother. She is the least companionable creature I've ever had the misfortune to meet. The wench rode well behind and a few feet off to the side, as if to proclaim that she was no part of them. They had found men's garb for her along the way; a tunic here, a mantle there, a pair of breeches and a cowled cloak, even an old iron breastplate. She looked more comfortable dressed as a man, but nothing would ever make her look handsome. Nor happy. Once out of Harrenhal, her usual pighead stubbornness had soon reasserted itself. "I want my arms and armor back," she had insisted. "Oh, by all means, let us have you back in steel," Jaime replied. "A helm, especially. We'll all be happier if you keep your mouth shut and your visor down."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他陡然掉转马头，到队伍末端去找布蕾妮。天知道我干吗多事！她是我这辈子最倒霉、最郁闷、最糟糕的伙伴。妞儿不仅骑在最后，而且离开队伍几码之远，走在旁边，好像在声明她不是他们中的一员。路上，人们为她拼凑起一身男人的衣服：外套、披风、马裤和兜帽斗篷，甚至找到一件老旧的铁胸甲。穿上男人的服装，她看起来顺眼多了，但全天下没打扮能让她变得潇洒，也没打扮能让她愉快。刚出赫伦堡，她那猪脑袋又开始顽固起来。“请你归还我的武器和盔甲，”她坚持。“噢，没错，得想办法让你重新穿上铁皮，”詹姆回答，“尤其是头盔。等你闭上嘴巴、合上面甲，大家皆大欢喜。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And now he's dead. He pictured Joff lying still and cold with a face black from poison, and still felt nothing. Perhaps he was the monster they claimed. if the Father Above came down to offer him back his son or his hand, Jaime knew which he would choose. He had a second son, after all, and seed enough for many more. If Cersei wants another child I'll give her one… and this time I'll hold him, and the Others take those who do not like it. Robert was rotting in his grave, and Jaime was sick of lies.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如今他死了。詹姆在脑海中勾勒出一副小乔静静躺卧、面容因剧毒而青紫的画面，却感觉不到丝毫悸动。或许自己真如别人所言，是一个怪物：如果天父给他机会，让他在儿子和右手之间挑选，他知道自己会毫不犹豫地选择右手。说到底，他还有一个儿子，还有种子足以生出许许多多儿子。瑟曦若想要，我就再给她一个…这次我要抱着他，异鬼也不能将父子分开。劳勃在坟墓里腐烂发臭，詹姆则受够了人间的谎言。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She never met Robb Stark, yet her grief for him runs deeper than mine for Joff. Or perhaps it was Lady Catelyn she mourned. They had been at Brindlewood when they had that news, from a red-faced tub of a knight named Ser Bertram Beesbury, whose arms were three beehives on a field striped black and yellow. A troop of Lord Piper's men had passed through Brindlewood only yesterday, Beesbury told them, rushing to King's Landing beneath a peace banner of their own. "With the Young Wolf dead Piper saw no point to fighting on. His son is captive at the Twins." Brienne gaped like a cow about to choke on her cud, so it fell to Jaime to draw out the tale of the Red Wedding.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她从未见过罗柏·史塔克，但哀悼他的程度比我哀悼小乔还要深。或许她哀悼的是凯特琳夫人吧。他们是在野猪林截获“消息”的，从一个气喘吁吁的肥胖骑士本特姆·毕斯柏里口中得来——他的纹章是黑黄条纹上的三个蜂窝。他告诉他们，昨天派柏大人的队伍刚打这儿经过，高举和平旗帜，朝君临飞奔，“少狼主已死，派柏无心恋战，况且他儿子还在孪河城被扣为人质。”布蕾妮惊得合不拢嘴，活像一头反刍中噎住的母牛，所以有关红色婚礼的细节只好由詹姆来问。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Since that day Brienne had been like one half-dead. Even calling her "wench" failed to provoke any response. The strength is gone from her. The woman had dropped a rock on Robin Ryger, battled a bear with a tourney sword, bitten off Vargo Float's ear, and fought Jaime to exhaustion… but she was broken now, done. "I'll speak to my father about returning you to Tarth, if it please you," he told her. "Or if you would rather stay, I could perchance find some place for you at court."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从那天起，布蕾妮就是这副半死不活的样子，当面叫她“妞儿”也不能激起任何反应。她的力量已经散去。这个落石袭击罗宾·莱格，钝剑对决高大黑熊，咬下瓦格·赫特的耳朵，把詹姆·兰尼斯特打得喘不过气来的女人…如今彻底垮了。“我将好言规劝父亲，尽快把你送回塔斯，”他告诉她，“若想留下，我也会在宫里给你谋个职位。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Every great lord has unruly bannermen who envy him his place," he told her afterward. "My father had the Reynes and Tarbecks, the Tyrells have the Florents, Hoster Tully had Walder Frey. Only strength keeps such men in their place. The moment they smell weakness… during the Age of Heroes, the Boltons used to flay the Starks and wear their skins as cloaks." She looked so miserable that Jaime almost found himself wanting to comfort her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“七大家族麾下各有虎视眈眈的竞争者，随时在寻找取而代之的机会。”独处的时候，他对妞儿解释，“我父亲有塔贝克家和雷耶斯家，提利尔有佛罗伦家，霍斯特·徒利有瓦德·佛雷。只有主家力量强大，才能迫使他们安守本分，一旦被嗅着虚弱的气息…你知道么？在英雄纪元，波顿家的人还剥史塔克的皮，拿它们当斗篷呢。”她看上去可怜兮兮，詹姆不禁想给予安慰。">查看中文翻译</div>

Almost every wagon had its guards; men-at-arms wearing the badges of small lordlings, sellswords in mail and boiled leather, sometimes only a pink-cheeked farmer's son clutching a homemade spear with a firehardened point. Jaime smiled at them all as he trotted past. At the gate, the gold cloaks were collecting coin from each driver before waving the wagons through. "What's this?" Steelshanks demanded.</div>
