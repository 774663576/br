<div class="line_en">Pondicherry Lodge stood in its own grounds and was girt round with a very high stone wall topped with broken glass. A single narrow iron-clamped door formed the only means of entrance. On this our guide knocked with a peculiar postman-like rat-tat.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was nearly eleven o'clock when we reached this final stage of our night's adventures. We had left the damp fog of the great city behind us, and the night was fairly fine. A warm wind blew from the westward, and heavy clouds moved slowly across the sky, with half a moon peeping occasionally through the rifts. It was clear enough to see for some distance, but Thaddeus Sholto took down one of the side lamps from the carriage to give us a better light upon our way.</div>

<div class="line_en">Our guide had left us the lantern. Holmes swung it slowly round and peered keenly at the house and at the great rubbish-heaps which cumbered the grounds. Miss Morstan and I stood together, and her hand was in mine. A wondrous subtle thing is love, for here were we two, who had never seen each other before that day, between whom no word or even look of affection had ever passed, and yet now in an hour of trouble our hands instinctively sought for each other. I have marvelled at it since, but at the time it seemed the most natural thing that I should go out to her so, and, as she has often told me, there was in her also the instinct to turn to me for comfort and protection. So we stood hand in hand like two children, and there was peace in our hearts for all the dark things that surrounded us.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们的向导把灯笼留给了我们。福尔摩斯提着那盏灯，缓慢地仔细审视着房子四周和堆在空地上的大堆垃圾。摩斯坦小姐跟我站在一起，依然握着我的手。爱是一个多么神奇而微妙的东西啊！我们两人在这之前从未谋面，也不曾传递过一句情话，甚至一丝情愫，然而，就在这患难的一个小时里，我们的手不自觉地紧紧握在了一起。我事后常惊讶于此，但在那个时候，我这么主动地握住她，却好像是最自然不过的事情，而她后来也常常告诉我，她当时本能般地依偎着我，寻求安慰和保护。我们手拉着手站在一起，如同两个小孩一般，这就使得我们的心在黑暗之中能保持宁静。">查看中文翻译</div>

"All day I have waited to hear from him, for he often likes to be alone; but an hour ago I feared that something was amiss, so I went up and peeped through the key hole.

<div class="line_en">Sherlock Holmes took the lamp and led the way, for Thaddeus Sholto's teeth were chattering in his head. So shaken was he that I had to pass my hand under his arm as we went up the stairs, for his knees were trembling under him. Twice as we ascended, Holmes whipped his lens out of his pocket and carefully examined marks which appeared to me to be mere shapeless smudges of dust upon the cocoanut-matting which served as a stair-carpet. He walked slowly from step to step, holding the lamp low, and shooting keen glances to right and left. Miss Morstan had remained behind with the frightened housekeeper.</div>

<div class="line_en">The third flight of stairs ended in a straight passage of some length, with a great picture in Indian tapestry upon the right of it and three doors upon the left. Holmes advanced along it in the same slow and methodical way, while we kept close at his heels, with our long black shadows streaming backward down the corridor. The third door was that which we were seeking. Holmes knocked without receiving any answer, and then tried to turn the handle and force it open. It was locked on the inside, however, and by a broad and powerful bolt, as we could see when we set our lamp up against it. The key being turned, however, the hole was not entirely closed. Sherlock Holmes bent down to it and instantly rose again with a sharp intaking of the breath.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="上了三段楼梯之后，就是一条很长的笔直的甬道，右墙上悬挂着一幅巨幅印度挂毯画，左边有三个门。福尔摩斯依然一边慢慢地走着，一边观察，我们紧随其后，长长的影子投射在身后的走廊上。第三扇门就是我们要去的地方。福尔摩斯敲了敲门，没有人应答，于是他就扭转门把手，试图强行开门。但是，门从里面反锁上了，我们把灯贴近了门缝，可以看见里面用很粗的门锁倒闩着。但钥匙被扭转过来了，所以锁眼没有全部封闭。舍洛克·福尔摩斯弯腰从锁眼里往里面看了看，立刻站了起来，倒吸了一口气。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I stooped to the hole and recoiled in horror. Moonlight was streaming into the room, and it was bright with a vague and shifty radiance. Looking straight at me and suspended, as it were, in the air, for all beneath was in shadow, there hung a face -- the very face of our companion Thaddeus. There was the same high, shining head, the same circular bristle of red hair, the same bloodless countenance. The features were set, however, in a horrible smile, a fixed and unnatural grin, which in that still and moonlit room was more jarring to the nerves than any scowl or contortion. So like was the face to that of our little friend that I looked round at him to make sure that he was indeed with us. Then I recalled to mind that he had mentioned to us that his brother and he were twins.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我弯下腰，凑近锁眼，却吓得立刻缩了回来。月光照进屋内，闪耀着粼粼光辉。有一张脸正直视着我，而且它仿佛是悬浮在半空中的，因为脸以下的部分都沉浸在黑暗中了——那张脸跟我们的伙伴塞迪厄斯一模一样。一样光亮的秃顶，一样围成一圈的红短发，一样没有血色的面孔。但是，那张脸表情呆滞，带着一丝可怕的微笑——一种定住的、不自然的露齿笑容，在这月光照耀的宁静房间里，这样一张脸比愁眉苦脸更让人害怕。由于这张脸跟我们的小个子朋友实在太像，我不得不转过头来确认他是否确实与我们在一起。然后，我想起他提起过，他们是孪生兄弟。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It appeared to have been fitted up as a chemical laboratory. A double line of glass-stoppered bottles was drawn up upon the wall opposite the door, and the table was littered over with Bunsen burners, test-tubes, and retorts. In the corners stood carboys of acid in wicker baskets. One of these appeared to leak or to have been broken, for a stream of dark-coloured liquid had trickled out from it, and the air was heavy with a peculiarly pungent, tarlike odour. A set of steps stood at one side of the room in the midst of a litter of lath and plaster, and above them there was an opening in the ceiling large enough for a man to pass through. At the foot of the steps a long coil of rope was thrown carelessly together.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这间屋子收拾得如同化学实验室一般。对着门的墙上摆着两层带玻璃塞的玻璃瓶子，桌子上摆满了本生灯、试管和蒸馏器。墙的一角里有许多用柳条篮子装着的玻璃酸瓶。其中有一个似乎是泄漏了，或是破碎了，流出一股黑色的液体，空气里弥漫着一股特别刺鼻的柏油气味。屋子的一边，在一堆散乱的板条和灰泥上，立着一架梯子，梯子上方的天花板上有一个大洞，大小差不多可以容人进出。梯子下面有一卷绳子，绳子散乱地堆放在一起。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In the light of the lantern I read with a thrill of horror, "The sign of the four."</div>

<div class="line_en">By the table in a wooden armchair the master of the house was seated all in a heap, with his head sunk upon his left shoulder and that ghastly, inscrutable smile upon his face. He was stiff and cold and had clearly been dead many hours. It seemed to me that not only his features but all his limbs were twisted and turned in the most fantastic fashion. By his hand upon the table there lay a peculiar instrument -- a brown, close-grained stick, with a stone head like a hammer, rudely lashed on with coarse twine. Beside it was a torn sheet of note-paper with some words scrawled upon it. Holmes glanced at it and then handed it to me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在桌子旁边放着一张有扶手的木椅子，上面坐着房间的主人，他的头斜倚在左肩上，脸上带着神秘、可怕的微笑。他的身体冰冷僵硬，明显已经死了好些时候了。在我看来，他不仅表情诡异，四肢也蜷缩得很古怪。他手边的桌上放着一个奇怪的器具——一个粗糙的棕色木棍，上面用粗麻线绑着一块石头，像是一把锤子。旁边放着一张从笔记本上撕下来的纸，上面潦草地写着几个字。福尔摩斯扫了一眼，然后递给了我。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It means murder," said he, stooping over the dead man. "Ah! I expected it. Look here!"</div>

<div class="line_en">We had almost forgotten our companion's presence since we entered the chamber. He was still standing in the doorway, the very picture of terror, wringing his hands and moaning to himself. Suddenly, however, he broke out into a sharp, querulous cry.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="自从进了屋子，我们几乎忘记了我们那位伙伴的存在。他仍然站在门口，仍然一副恐惧的模样，正在搓着手自言自语。忽然，他大声地叫嚷起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“宝物没有了！”他说，“他们把他的宝物抢走了！我们就是从那个洞口把宝物拿下来的。我帮他拿的！我是最后一个见到他的人！昨晚，我把他一个人留在这里，我下楼的时候，听到他锁上了门。”">查看中文翻译</div>
