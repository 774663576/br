<div class="line_en">As August wore on, the square of unkempt grass in the middle of Grimmauld Place shriveled in the sun until it was brittle and brown. The inhabitants of number twelve were never seen by anybody in the surrounding houses, and nor was number twelve itself. The Muggles who lived in Grimmauld Place had long since accepted the amusing mistake in the numbering that had caused number eleven to sit beside number thirteen.</div>

<div class="line_en">And yet the square was now attracting a trickle of visitors who seemed to find the anomaly most intriguing. Barely a day passed without one or two people arriving in Grimmauld Place with no other purpose, or so it seemed, than to lean against the railings facing numbers eleven and thirteen, watching the join between the two houses. The lurkers were never the same two days running, although they all seemed to share a dislike for normal clothing. Most of the Londoners who passed them were used to eccentric dressers and took little notice, though occasionally one of them might glance back, wondering why anyone would wear such long cloaks in this heat.</div>

<div class="line_en">The watchers seemed to be gleaning little satisfaction from their vigil. Occasionally one of them started forward excitedly, as if they had seen something interesting at last, only to fall back looking disappointed.</div>

<div class="line_en">Meanwhile, inside number twelve, Harry had just entered the hall. He had nearly lost his balance as he Apparated onto the top step just outside the front door, and thought that the Death Eaters might have caught a glimpse of his momentarily exposed elbow. Shutting the front door carefully behind him, he pulled off the Invisibility Cloak, draped it over his arm, and hurried along the gloomy hallway toward the door that led to the basement, a stolen copy of the Daily Prophet clutched in his hand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="与此同时，在12号房中，哈利刚刚走进门厅。他刚才幻影显形到前门外台阶顶上时差点失去平稳，心想食死徒可能看到了他一时暴露在外的胳膊肘。他小心地关上前门，脱下隐形衣搭在手臂上，沿着昏暗的走廊匆匆朝通往地下室的门口走去，手中还捏着一份偷来的《预言家日报》。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On the first day of September there were more people lurking in the square than ever before. Half a dozen men in long cloaks stood silent and watchful, gazing as ever at houses eleven and thirteen, but the thing for which they were waiting still appeared elusive. As evening drew in, bringing with it an unexpected gust of chilly rain for the first time in weeks, there occurred one of those inexplicable moments when they appeared to have seen something interesting. The man with the twisted face pointed and his closest companion, a podgy, pallid man, started forward, but a moment later they had relaxed into their previous state of inactivity, looking frustrated and disappointed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="九月的第一天，逗留在广场上的人比以前更多。六个穿着长斗篷的男人沉默警惕，像往常一样凝视着11号和13号房子，但他们等待的东西似乎仍然无影无踪。傍晚来临，意外地带来了几星期内第一场凉飕飕的阵雨，这里又出现了那种神秘时刻，他们似乎看到了什么有趣的东西。一个歪脸男人指点着，离他最近的同伴——一个矮胖而苍白的男人跃向前去，但片刻之后，他们又恢复了先前静止的状态，显得懊丧而失望。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The kitchen was almost unrecognizable. Every surface now shone: Copper pots and pans had been burnished to a rosy glow; the wooden tabletop gleamed; the goblets and plates already laid for dinner glinted in the light from a merrily blazing fire, on which a cauldron was simmering. Nothing in the room, however, was more dramatically different than the house-elf who now came hurrying toward Harry, dressed in a snowy-white towel, his ear hair as clean and fluffy as cotton wool, Regulus's locket bouncing on his thin chest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="厨房几乎认不出来了。现在所有东西的表面都焕然一新：铜锅和铜盘擦出了玫瑰色光泽，木头桌面也擦得发亮，晚餐的杯碟已经摆好，在炉火辉映下闪闪发光，欢乐的火苗上炖着一口大锅。但那快步迎向哈利的家养小精灵的变化比屋里的变化更大，他裹着一条雪白的毛巾，耳朵里的毛像棉絮一般洁白蓬松，雷古勒斯的挂坠盒在他瘦瘦的胸脯上跳动。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I didn't kill you," he said, once it had unrolled, then held his breath as the dusty jinx-figure exploded.

<div class="line_cn" title="“我没有杀死你。”舌头一松开，他就说道，然后屏住呼吸，土灰色的身影爆炸了。他一直下到通往厨房的楼梯中部，远离了炸出的灰尘，布莱克夫人也听不见时，他才叫道：“有新闻，你们不喜欢的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“有什么情况？”罗恩担心地问。他和赫敏刚才在研究一沓笔记和手绘地图，把厨房长桌的一头都摊满了，但现在两人都看着哈利。哈利大步走过去，把报纸丢在他们的那堆羊皮纸上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Death Eaters," said Harry. "There are pictures of them inside. They were at the top of the tower when Snape killed Dumbledore, so it's all friends together. And," Harry went on bitterly, drawing up a chair, "I can't see that the other teachers have got any choice but to stay. If the Ministry and Voldemort are behind Snape it'll be a choice between staying and teaching, or a nice few years in Azkaban -- and that's if they're lucky. I reckon they'll stay to try and protect the students."</div>

<div class="line_en">Ron glanced at his watch.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="罗恩看了看表。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In his mind's eye Harry seemed to see the scarlet steam engine as he and Ron had once followed it by air, shimmering between fields and hills, a rippling scarlet caterpillar. He was sure Ginny, Neville, and Luna were sitting together at this moment, perhaps wondering where he, Ron, and Hermione were, or debating how best to undermine Snape's new regime.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利仿佛看到那列红色的蒸汽机车，跟他和罗恩在空中追随它那次一样，闪闪发光地穿行在田野山岭之间，像一条蠕动的红色毛虫。他相信金妮、纳威和卢娜此刻正坐在一起，也许在猜测他、罗恩和赫敏在什么地方，或是在争论怎样才能破坏斯内普的新政权。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He began to spoon soup into his mouth. The quality of Kreacher's cooking had improved dramatically ever since he had been given Regulus's locket: Today's French onion was as good as Harry had ever tasted.</div>

<div class="line_en">She was carrying a large, framed picture, which she now lowered to the floor before seizing her small, beaded bag from the kitchen sideboard. Opening it, she proceeded to force the painting inside, and despite the fact that it was patently too large to fit inside the tiny bag, within a few seconds it had vanished, like so much else, into the bag's capacious depths.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她抱来个大画框，放到地上，从厨房柜子里抓过她的串珠小包，打开来把画往里塞。虽然这画框明显太大，但几秒钟后它也像那么多东西一样，消失在小包宽敞无比的肚子里了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Phineas Nigellus," Hermione explained as she threw the bag onto the kitchen table with the usual sonorous, clanking crash.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Sorry?" said Ron, but Harry understood. The painted image of Phineas Nigellus Black was able to flit between his portrait in Grimmauld Place and the one that hung in the headmaster's office at Hogwarts: the circular tower-top room where Snape was no doubt sitting right now, in triumphant possession of Dumbledore's collection of delicate, silver magical instruments, the stone Pensieve, the Sorting Hat and, unless it had been moved elsewhere, the sword of Gryffindor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“什么？”罗恩说，可是哈利懂了。菲尼亚斯·奈杰勒斯·布莱克的肖像能在格里莫广场和霍格沃茨校长办公室的两个画框间自由来去，斯内普现在肯定已坐在塔楼顶上那个圆形的房间，得意地占据了邓布利多那些精致的银色魔法仪器、石头冥想盆、分院帽，还有格兰芬多的宝剑——如果它未被转移的话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Snape could send Phineas Nigellus to look inside this house for him," Hermione explained to Ron as she resumed her seat. "But let him try it now, all Phineas Nigellus will be able to see is the inside of my handbag."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“斯内普可以派菲尼亚斯·奈杰勒斯到这所房子里来打探情况。”赫敏向罗恩解释着，坐了下来，“现在让他打探去吧，菲尼亚斯·奈杰勒斯只能看到我手提包里的东西。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You realize that I am on my way downstairs to interrogate your wife, Cattermole? In fact, I'm quite surprised you're not down there holding her hand while she waits. Already given her up as a bad job, have you? Probably wise. Be sure and marry a pureblood next time."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你知道我正要下楼去审讯你老婆吧，卡特莫尔？我倒觉得挺意外，你怎么没在那里握着手陪她等着。已经要跟她划清界限了吗，啊？可能是明智的。下次记得找一个纯种的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But if my wife were accused of being a Mudblood," said Yaxley, "-- not that any woman I married would ever be mistaken for such filth -- and the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement needed a job doing, I would make it my priority to do that job, Cattermole. Do you understand me?"</div>

<div class="line_en">The golden grille before them clattered open. With a nod and unpleasant smile to Harry, who was evidently expected to appreciate this treatment of Cattermole, Yaxley swept away toward another lift. Harry, Ron, and Hermione entered theirs, but nobody followed them: It was as if they were infectious. The grilles shut with a clang and the lift began to move upward.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们面前的金色栅栏门哗啦打开了，亚克斯利转身朝另一部电梯走去，临走时朝哈利点了点头，还露出一个令人厌恶的笑容，显然以为哈利会对他这样教训卡特莫尔表示欣赏。哈利、罗恩和赫敏进了他们的电梯，但没有别人进来，好像他们有传染病似的。栅栏门哐当关上，电梯开始上升。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Try Finite Incantatem," said Hermione at once, "that should stop the rain if it's a hex or curse; if it doesn't, something's gone wrong with an Atmospheric Charm, which will be more difficult to fix, so as an interim measure try Impervius to protect his belongings --"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“试试终止魔咒，”赫敏马上说，“如果是恶咒或咒语造成的下雨，应该会停的。如果停不了，那就是气象咒出了问题，比较麻烦一点，你暂时先用水火不侵咒保护他的东西——”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Say it again, slowly --" said Ron, searching his pockets desperately for a quill, but at that moment the lift juddered to a halt. A disembodied female voice said, "Level four, Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, incorporating Beast, Being, and Spirit Divisions, Goblin Liaison Office, and Pest Advisory Bureau," and the grilles slid open again, admitting a couple of wizards and several pale violet paper airplanes that fluttered around the lamp in the ceiling of the lift.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“再说一遍，慢点儿——”罗恩一边说，一边着急地在口袋里找笔，但这时电梯震颤着停住了。一个空洞的女声说道：“第四层，神奇动物管理控制司，包含野兽、异类和幽灵办公室、妖精联络处和害虫咨询处。”栅栏门再次打开，放进来两个巫师，还有几架淡紫色的纸飞机，绕着电梯顶部的灯泡飞舞。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Morning, Albert," said a bushily whiskered man, smiling at Harry. He glanced over at Ron and Hermione as the lift creaked upward once more; Hermione was now whispering frantic instructions to Ron. The wizard leaned toward Harry, leering, and muttered, "Dirk Cresswell, eh? From Goblin Liaison? Nice one, Albert. I'm pretty confident I'll get his job now!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“早上好，艾伯特。”一个大胡子男巫笑着对哈利说，然后瞟了罗恩、赫敏一眼。电梯又吱嘎上升。赫敏在急急地小声给罗恩支招，那个男巫凑到哈利跟前，斜睨着他，低声道：“德克·克莱斯韦，嗯？妖精联络处的？干得好，艾伯特。现在，我很有把握会得到他的职位了！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He winked. Harry smiled back, hoping that this would suffice. The lift stopped; the grilles opened once more.</div>

<div class="line_en">The golden grilles slid apart again and Hermione gasped. Four people stood before them, two of them deep in conversation: a longhaired wizard wearing magnificent robes of black and gold, and a squat, toadlike witch wearing a velvet bow in her short hair and clutching a clipboard to her chest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="金色栅栏门再次拉开，赫敏倒吸一口凉气。四个人站在他们面前，其中两个正在密切交谈：一个长发男巫身穿黑底绣金的华丽长袍，一个矮矮胖胖、长得像癞蛤蟆的女巫短发上戴着天鹅绒蝴蝶结，胸前抱着个笔记板。">查看中文翻译</div>
