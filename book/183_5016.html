<div class="line_en">Very soon after they had left Ramandu's country they began to feel that they had already sailed beyond the world. All was different. For one thing they all found that they were needing less sleep. One did not want to go to bed. nor to eat much, nor even to talk except in low voices. Another thing was the light. There was too much of it. The sun when it came up each morning looked twice, if not; three times, its usual size. And every morning (which gave Lucy the strangest feeling of all) the huge white birds, singing their song with human voices in a language no one knew, streamed overhead and vanished astern on their way to their breakfast at Aslan's Table. A little later they came flying back and vanished into the east.</div>

<div class="line_en">And it was. The first thing that she noticed was a little black object, about the size of a shoe, travelling along at the same speed as the ship. For a moment she thought it was something floating on the surface. But then there came floating past a bit of stale bread which the cook had just thrown out of the galley. And the bit of bread looked as if it were going to collide with the black thing, but it didn't. It passed above it, and Lucy now saw that the black thing could not be on the surface. Then the black thing suddenly got very much bigger and flicked back to normal size a moment later.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="果然如此，她注意到的第一样东西是个小小的黑物件，像一只鞋那么大小，同船速一样快地跟着船一路过来。一时间她还以为那东西是漂在水面上的。可是这时厨子刚从厨房里扔出一块陈面包，面包在水面上漂过，看起来好像要跟那东西相撞了，谁知竞没撞上。面包在那东西上面掠过了，露茜这才明白那黑东西不可能在水面上。然后那黑东西一下子大得不得了，过一会儿又闪回原来的大小。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Now Lucy knew she had seen something just like that happen somewhere else -- if only she could remember where. She held her hand to her head and screwed up her face and put out her tongue in the effort to remember. At last she did. Of course! It was like what you saw from a train on a bright sunny day. You saw the black shadow of your own coach running along the fields at the same pace as the train. Then you went into a cutting; and immediately the same shadow flicked close up to you and got big, racing : long the grass of the cutting-bank. Then you came out of the cutting and -- Pick! -- once more the black shadow had gone back to its normal size and was running along the fields.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="露茜马上知道自己在别处也看见过同样的情景——只要她记得在哪儿就好了。她一手撑着头，板着脸，伸出舌头，拼命地想。终于想出来了。不用说！就像你在阳光明媚的好天，乘在火车里看出来的情景一样。你看见的是自己那列客车的黑影同车速一样快地在田野上一路奔驰。等到火车开进路堑，那影子顿时就一闪贴近火车，变大，顺着路堑的草坡一路飞跑。再等到开出路堑——一下子！——那黑影又变回原来的大小，在田野间一路飞驰。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's our shadow! -- the shadow of the Dawn Treader," said Lucy. "Our shadow running along on the bottom of the sea. That time when it got bigger it went over a hill. But in that case the water must be clearer than I thought! Good gracious, I must he seeing the bottom of the sea; fathoms and fathoms down."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“原来是我们这条船的影子！——黎明踏浪者号的影子，”露茜说，“我们的船影在海底奔驰。开过海底的山顶时船影就大了。这样的话，海水一定比我想象中还要清！老天哪，我一定看见好深好深的海底了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As soon as she had said this she realized that the great silvery expanse which she had been seeing (without noticing) for some time was really the sand on the sea-bed and that ail sorts of darker or brighter patches were not lights and shadows on the surface but real things on the bottom. At present, for instance, they were passing over a mass of soft purply green with a broad, winding strip of pale grey in the middle of it But now that she knew it was on the bottom she saw it much better. She could see that bits of the dark stuff were much higher than other bits and were waving gently. "Just like trees in a wind," said Lucy. "And do believe that's what they are. It's a submarine forest."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她说完这句话，心里已明白自己不知不觉一直看了好一阵子的那一大片粼粼银光实际上是海底的沙滩，各种深一片淡一片的不是海面上的光影，而是水底的实物。比如说，眼下他们的船开过一大丛软软的绿中带紫的东西，当中还有一条弯弯绕绕的淡灰色阔带子。不过既然她知道这是在海底下，她看起来就更清楚了。她能看见那一小片黑乎乎的东西比另一片高，而且轻轻在飘动。“正像风中树木一样，”露茜说，“我相信这些是树。是海底森林。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They passed on above it and presently the pale streak was joined by another pale streak. "If I was down there," thought Lucy, "that streak would be just like a road through the wood. And that place where it joins the other Would be a crossroads. Oh, I do wish I was. Hallo! the forest is coming to an end. And I do believe the streak really was a road! I can still see it going on across the open sand. It's a different colour. And it's marked out with something at the edges -- dotted lines. Perhaps they are stones. And now it's getting wider."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们开过了这片森林上面，不一会儿那条灰带子就和另一条灰带子汇合了。“假如我在下面，”露茜心里想，“那条带子就像林间一条路。两条带子的汇合点就是十字路口了。啊呀，我真希望在下面啊。嗨！森林到头啦。我相信那带子真是一条路！我还能看见它一直穿过空旷的沙滩呢。颜色也不同了。边上还画着什么——虚线。也许是石头吧。现在变宽了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But it was not really getting wider, it was getting nearer. She realized this because of the way in which the shadow of the ship came rushing up towards her. And the road she felt sure it was a road now -- began to go in zigzags. Obviously it was climbing up a steep hill. And when she held her head sideways and looked back, what she saw was very like what you see when you look down a winding road from the top of a hill. She could even see the shafts of sunlight falling through the deep water on to the wooded valley -- and, in the extreme distance, everything melting away into a dim greenness. But some places -- the sunny ones, she thought -- were ultramarine blue.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过这并不是真的宽了，而是近了。她知道这点，因为船影经过时，这条路朝船身冲过来了。而这条路——她拿准这是条路了——开始弯弯曲曲了。显然这条路是爬上一座陡峭小山的路。当她侧着头，回头看时，觉得很像在山顶俯看一条弯弯曲曲的道路那样。她甚至看得见阳光一直透过深水，照在树木繁茂的山谷上；而在最远处，一切景物都融入模模糊糊一片绿色中。但有些地方——据她看，是照着阳光的地方——倒是深蓝色的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Why! -- it's a city or a huge castle," said Lucy to herself "But I wonder why they've built it on top of a high mountain?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哎呀！——原来是座城市啊！要不就是座大城堡。”露茜自言自语说，“可是不知道为什么他们要把这造在高山顶上？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She could not, however, spend much time looking back; what was coming into view in the forward direction was too exciting. The road had apparently now reached the top of the hill and ran straight forward. Little specks were moving to and fro on it. And now something most wonderful, fortunately in full sunlight -- or as full as it can be when it falls through fathoms of water -- flashed into sight. It was knobbly and jagged and of a pearly, or perhaps an ivory, colour. She was so nearly straight above it that at first she could hardly make out what it was. But everything became plain when she noticed its shadow. The sunlight was falling across Lucy's shoulders, so the shadow of the thing lay stretched out on the sand behind it. And by its shape she saw clearly that it was a shadow of towers and pinnacles, minarets and domes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，她不能多花时间回头看；前方映入眼帘的景观太令人激动了。现在那条路分明通到山顶，笔直向前了。上面还有小小的斑点在动来动去。眼下，幸亏阳光充足——阳光照进深深的海底能有多亮就有多亮——有样最奇妙的东西闪现在眼前。这东西是小圆丘形，参差不齐，颜色像珍珠，或者说像象牙。开头她几乎恰好正在这东西上面，所以简直分辨不出是什么。但等她看到这东西的影子才一清二楚。阳光正照过露茜的肩膀，所以那东西的影子直躺在它后面的沙地上。看形状她才明白那原来是高塔、尖塔、叫拜楼和圆顶的影子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Long afterwards when she was back in England and talked all these adventures over with Edmund, they thought of a reason and I am pretty sure it is the true one. In the sea, the deeper you go, the darker and colder it gets, and it is down there, in the dark and cold, that dangerous things live -- the squid and the Sea Serpent and the Kraken. The valleys are the wild, unfriendly places. The sea-people feel about their valleys as we do about mountains, and feel about their mountains as we feel about valleys. It is on the heights (or, as we would say, "in the shallows") that there is warmth and peace. The reckless hunters and brave knights of the sea go down into the depths on quests and adventures, but return home to the heights for rest and peace, courtesy and council, the sports, the dances and the songs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她回到英国很久以后，跟爱德蒙谈起这一切奇遇，他们想出一条理由，我相信这理由一点不错。在海里，越深越黑，越深越冷，危险的怪物——大乌贼啊、大海蛇啊、海怪啊，就住在下面又黑又冷的地方。山谷都是荒野凶险的地方。海人对他们山谷的看法就跟我们对高山的看法一样，对他们高山的看法又跟我们对山谷的看法一样。在高处（或者，按我们的说法是“在浅处”）才又暖和又宁静。海底那些鲁莽的猎人和勇敢的骑士到深处去探险猎奇，然后回到高处家里安心休息，跟别人礼尚往来，开会议事，娱乐玩耍，唱歌跳舞。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There were between fifteen and twenty of them, and all mounted on sea-horses -- not the tiny little sea-horses which you may have seen in museums but horses rather bigger than themselves. They must be noble and lordly people, Lucy thought, for she could catch the gleam of gold on some of their foreheads and streamers of emerald or orange-coloured stuff fluttered from their shoulders in the current. Then:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一共有十五个到二十个左右，全骑在海马上——不是你在博物馆里看到的那种小海马，而是比他们身材高大得多的海马。露茜心想，他们一定是些王公贵族，因为她能一眼看见水里有些人的脑门上金光闪闪，翠绿色的飘带或橙红色的织物在他们肩上飘动。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They had passed the city and the sea-bed was still rising. It was only a few hundred feet below the ship now. The road had disappeared. They were sailing above an open park-like country, dotted with little groves of brightlycoloured vegetation. And then -- Lucy nearly squealed aloud with excitement-she had seen People.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们这条船开过城市，海底不断在升高。现在海底离船下只有几百英尺了。那条路也不见了。他们这条船现在正在一片公园般空旷的地方上面航行，地上点缀着一簇簇色彩鲜艳的草木。于是——露茜差点兴奋得高声尖叫起来——她看见人了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, bother these fish!" said Lucy, for a whole shoal of small fat fish, swimming quite close to the surface, had come between her and the Sea People. But though this spoiled her view it led to the most interesting thing of all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="露茜说：“啊呀，这些鱼真讨厌！”因为一群肥肥的小鱼正游得贴近水面，挡在她和海人之间。可是虽然这一来使她大为扫兴，却让她看到一幕最有趣的事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Suddenly a fierce little fish of a kind she had never seen before came darting up from below, snapped, grabbed, and sank rapidly with one of the fat fish in its mouth. And all the Sea People were sitting on their horses staring up at what had happened. They seemed to be talking and laughing. And before the hunting fish had got back to them with its prey, another of the same kind came up from the Sea People. And Lucy was almost certain that one big Sea Man who sat on his sea-horse in the middle of the party had sent it or released it; as if he had been holdng it back till then in his hand or on his wrist.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="忽然间，有一条她从来没见过的凶狠的小鱼冷不防从水底跳起来，猛地张口咬住一条肥鱼不放，衔在嘴里迅速沉到水下。海人都骑在海马上，抬眼看着这一幕。他们似乎有说有笑。那条猎鱼还没带着捕获物回到他们身边，另一条同样的猎鱼又从海人身边跳上水面。露茜几乎肯定就是这一伙中间那个骑着海马的大个子把猎鱼放出去的；似乎刚才他一直把猎鱼抓在手里或架在手腕上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She stopped suddenly because the scene was changing. The Sea People had noticed the Dawn Treader. The shoal of fish hard scattered in every direction: the People themselves were coming up to find out the meaning of this big, black thing which had come between them and the sun. And now they were so close to the surface that if they had been in air, instead of water, Lucy could have spoken to them. There were men and women both. All wore coronets of some kind and many had chains of pearls. They wore no other clothes. Their bodies were the colour of old ivory, their hair dark purple. The King in the centre (no one could mistake him for anything but the King) looked proudly and fiercely into Lucy's face and shook a spear in his hand. His knights did the same. The faces of the ladies were filled with astonishment. Lucy felt sure they had never seen a ship or a human before -- and how should they, in seas beyond the world's end where no ship ever came?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她突然住口了，因为景象变了。海人看到了黎明踏浪者号。那群鱼向四处逃窜，海人也亲自冒出来查看这个挡在太阳和他们之间的黑乎乎的庞然大物是什么玩意儿。眼下他们快贴近水面了，如果他们在露天，不是在水里，露茜倒会跟他们说话呢。他们有男有女，头上都戴着某种王冠，许多人还戴着珍珠项链。他们没穿别的衣服。身体是陈年象牙的颜色，头发是深紫红色。国王在当中（没人会认错他）高傲而凶狠地注视着露茜的脸，手里挥舞一枝长矛。手下的骑士也跟他一致行动。几位女的脸上满是惊讶的神色。露茜相信他们以前根本没见过船或人——他们身处世界尽头外边的海洋里，从来没有船到过那儿，怎么见识得到呢？">查看中文翻译</div>

And then they fly them -- or I suppose I should say swim them -- at the others."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哎呀，那可真怪，”露茜说，“这是一支狩猎队啊。不过倒更像一支放鹰打猎队。对了，准是的。他们手腕上架着这些凶猛的小鱼，骑海马出来，正如我们很久以前在凯尔帕拉维尔当国王和女王那阵子，经常手腕上架着猎鹰，骑马出去一样。见到猎物就放猎鱼飞——我看，该说放猎鱼游——向猎物。怎么？……”">查看中文翻译</div>

But by now everyone knew that it wasn't strictly a man. It was Reepicheep.</div>

No one, of course, was afraid of Reepicheep's drowning, for he was an excellent swimmer; but the three who knew what was going on below the water were afraid of those long, cruel spears in the hands of the Sea People.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="说了这么一大套话并不意味着德里宁当真不喜欢雷佩契普。恰恰相反，他很喜欢它，因此害怕它出事，而由于害怕，德里宁才发脾气——正如你母亲为了怕你跑出去在路上迎面碰到汽车而大为生气，而对一个陌生人就决不会这样。当然，雷佩契普掉进水里，谁也不怕，因为它是个游泳好手：可是知道水下将有什么事发生的三个人却害怕海人手中那些杀气腾腾的长矛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He'll blurt the whole thing out if we don't shut him up," cried Drinian. To prevent this he rushed to the side and lowered a rope himself, shouting to the sailors, "All right, all right. Back to your places. I hope I can heave a mouse up without help." And as Reepicheep began climbing up the rope not very nimbly because his wet fur made him heavy -- Drinian leaned over and whispered to him,</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“如果我们不让它闭上嘴，它可要把什么事情都捅出去了。”德里宁叫道。为了阻止它，他奔向舷侧，亲自放下一根缆绳，对水手们喊着说：“行了，行了。回到你们的岗位上去。希望我不要人帮忙就能把一只老鼠拉上来。”雷佩契普从缆绳上爬上来了——行动不是很利索，因为浑身皮毛都湿透，身子也沉了——德里宁弯下腰，对它悄声说：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And one by one everybody on board drank. And for a long time they were all silent. They felt almost too well and strong to bear it; and presently they began to notice another result. As I have said before, there had been too much light ever since they left the island of Ramandu -- the sun too large (though not too hot), the sea too bright, the air too shining. Now, the light grew no less -- if anything, it increased -- but they could bear it. They could look straight up at the sun without blinking. They could see more light than they had ever seen before. And the deck and the sail and their own faces and bodies became brighter and brighter and every rope shone. And next morning, when the sun rose, now five or six times its old size, they stared hard into it and could see the very feathers of the birds that came flying from it.</div>
