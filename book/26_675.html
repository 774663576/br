<div class="line_en">Much as I had made of the fact that this name had never once, between us, been sounded, the quick, smitten glare with which the child's face now received it fairly likened my breach of the silence to the smash of a pane of glass.</div>

<div class="line_en">Miss Jessel stood before us on the opposite bank exactly as she had stood the other time, and I remember, strangely, as the first feeling now produced in me, my thrill of joy at having brought on a proof. She was there, and I was justified; she was there, and I was neither cruel nor mad. She was there for poor scared Mrs. Grose, but she was there most for Flora; and no moment of my monstrous time was perhaps so extraordinary as that in which I consciously threw out to her -- with the sense that, pale and ravenous demon as she was, she would catch and understand it -- an inarticulate message of gratitude. She rose erect on the spot my friend and I had lately quitted, and there was not, in all the long reach of her desire, an inch of her evil that fell short. This first vividness of vision and emotion were things of a few seconds, during which Mrs. Grose's dazed blink across to where I pointed struck me as a sovereign sign that she too at last saw, just as it carried my own eyes precipitately to the child.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杰赛尔小姐站在对岸，面对我们，跟那天在湖边的情形一模一样，很奇怪的是，我记得，当时我所产生的第一感觉是因为喜悦而颤抖，因为证据出现了。她在那里，我是对的。她在那里，我既不严厉，也不发狂。她在那里是为了可怜的、受了惊的格罗斯太太，但她在那里更是为了弗洛拉。在我那些恐怖的日子里，可能没有哪一刻比这时更非同寻常了，我自觉向她投去感激的、无言的目光——我的直觉告诉我，虽然她是一个苍白的、贪婪的恶魔，但她会感受到并理解我的目光。她直直地出现在我和我朋友刚刚离开的地方，在她的欲望所及的范围内，她的邪恶无处不在、无孔不入。最初明晰的景象和情感仅仅持续了几秒，在这几秒钟里，格罗斯太太向对岸我所指的地方迷茫地眨着眼睛，这是一个重要的信号，让我明白她终于也看到了，就像它让我的眼睛猛然盯着那个孩子看一样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It added to the interposing cry, as if to stay the blow, that Mrs. Grose, at the same instant, uttered over my violence -- the shriek of a creature scared, or rather wounded, which, in turn, within a few seconds, was completed by a gasp of my own.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="与此同时，仿佛是要让这个打击持续下去，格罗斯太太加进来的哭喊声盖过了我的暴行，那是一个受到惊吓的人，更准确地说是一个受伤害的人才会发出的尖叫。几秒种后，这叫声又被我自己的一声急喘打断了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The revelation then of the manner in which Flora was affected startled me, in truth, far more than it would have done to find her also merely agitated, for direct dismay was of course not what I had expected. Prepared and on her guard as our pursuit had actually made her, she would repress every betrayal; and I was therefore shaken, on the spot, by my first glimpse of the particular one for which I had not allowed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那时弗洛拉表现出来的态度让我大吃一惊，事实上，我想象她也会有点儿惊慌，但事实远非如此，当然我并不希望看到她惊慌。她实际上是有所准备，并提防着我们的追踪的，她会抑制每一次暴露。因此，当我第一次瞥见我不应该看到的一个细节时，我立马惊呆了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">To see her, without a convulsion of her small pink face, not even feign to glance in the direction of the prodigy I announced, but only, instead of that, turn at ME an expression of hard, still gravity, an expression absolutely new and unprecedented and that appeared to read and accuse and judge me -- this was a stroke that somehow converted the little girl herself into the very presence that could make me quail.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我看到她粉红的小脸上没有一点儿惊慌，她甚至没有假装向我发现怪事的方向瞥上一眼，但相反，她只是转向我，带着一种冷峻、平静而严肃的表情。这是一种完全陌生的、前所未有的表情，好像是在解读我、责怨我、审判我——这个打击在某种程度上把这个小女孩转变成了眼前让我恐惧的实体。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I quailed even though my certitude that she thoroughly saw was never greater than at that instant, and in the immediate need to defend myself I called it passionately to witness. "She's there, you little unhappy thing -- there, there, THERE, and you see her as well as you see me!" I had said shortly before to Mrs. Grose that she was not at these times a child, but an old, old woman, and that description of her could not have been more strikingly confirmed than in the way in which, for all answer to this, she simply showed me, without a concession, an admission, of her eyes, a countenance of deeper and deeper, of indeed suddenly quite fixed, reprobation. I was by this time -- if I can put the whole thing at all together -- more appalled at what I may properly call her manner than at anything else, though it was simultaneously with this that I became aware of having Mrs. Grose also, and very formidably, to reckon with.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="即使那一刻，我确信她完全看到的并不比她以前所看到的多，我还是害怕，我迫切地需要为自己辩解，我激动地向这个目击者喊着：“她在那里，你这个不幸的小东西——那里，那里，那里，你看得见她，就像你看得见我一样！”我不久前对格罗斯太太说过，弗洛拉在这些时候不再是一个孩子，而是一个很成熟的老女人。这种说法此刻得到了最好的证实，作为回答，她的眼神里没有妥协、承认，她只是展现给我一种越来越深邃的表情，这表情突然凝住，充满斥责。我到现在——如果我能把整件事情整合到一起的话——恰当地说，我对于她态度的恐惧要超过其他任何事情，虽然与此同时我意识到还要考虑到格罗斯太太，她也很难对付。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It had already lasted a minute, and it lasted while I continued, seizing my colleague, quite thrusting her at it and presenting her to it, to insist with my pointing hand. "You don't see her exactly as WE see? -- You mean to say you don't now -- NOW? She's as big as a blazing fire! Only look, dearest woman, LOOK --!" She looked, even as I did, and gave me, with her deep groan of negation, repulsion, compassion -- the mixture with her pity of her relief at her exemption -- a sense, touching to me even then, that she would have backed me up if she could. I might well have needed that, for with this hard blow of the proof that her eyes were hopelessly sealed I felt my own situation horribly crumble, I felt -- I saw -- my livid predecessor press, from her position, on my defeat, and I was conscious, more than all, of what I should have from this instant to deal with in the astounding little attitude of Flora.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="幽灵已经在那里站了一分钟，我继续抓着我的同伴，把她推向幽灵的方向，让她呈现在幽灵面前，当我用手为她强调指明幽灵的位置时，幽灵仍然站在那里。“你不能像我们一样清楚地看到她吗？你的意思是说现在你没看见——现在？她就像一个熊熊燃烧的火球一样大！只要看看就行，亲爱的女士，看看！”正如我一样，她往对岸看去，一边发出一种拒绝、反感、同情的低沉的叹息——其中夹杂着同情的解脱——这给我一种感觉，当时甚至让我感动的感觉，如果她能看见的话，她会支持我的。我十分需要她的支持，因为被这个有力的证据打击，她的双眼被无望地遮蔽了，我觉得自己的处境急转直下，我感到——我看到——我那脸色铁青的前任正从她的阵地上逼我走向失败，更重要的是，我想到从此刻起，我该如何应对弗洛拉那令人震惊的态度。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Flora continued to fix me with her small mask of reprobation, and even at that minute I prayed God to forgive me for seeming to see that, as she stood there holding tight to our friend's dress, her incomparable childish beauty had suddenly failed, had quite vanished. I've said it already -- she was literally, she was hideously, hard; she had turned common and almost ugly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="弗洛拉继续带着她那斥责的表情盯着我，在那一刻我甚至祈祷上帝原谅我，因为我似乎看到，当她站在那里紧紧抓住格罗斯太太的裙子时，她那无与伦比的、孩子所特有的美丽突然间消失殆尽。我早已说过——她从前确实非常地冷酷。那时她却变得平凡，近乎丑陋。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When I reached the gate in the fence the boat, to my surprise, was gone, so that I had a fresh reflection to make on Flora's extraordinary command of the situation. She passed that night, by the most tacit, and I should add, were not the word so grotesque a false note, the happiest of arrangements, with Mrs. Grose. I saw neither of them on my return, but, on the other hand, as by an ambiguous compensation, I saw a great deal of Miles. I saw -- I can use no other phrase -- so much of him that it was as if it were more than it had ever been.</div>
