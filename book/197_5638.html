<div class="line_en">It was a large and beautiful circular room, full of funny little noises. A number of curious silver instruments stood on spindlelegged tables, whirring and emitting little puffs of smoke. The walls were covered with portraits of old headmasters and headmistresses, all of whom were snoozing gently in their frames. There was also an enormous, claw-footed desk, and, sitting on a shelf behind it, a shabby, tattered wizard's hat -- the Sorting Hat.</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry looked around. One thing was certain: of all the teachers' offices Harry had visited so far this year, Dumbledore's was by far the most interesting. If he hadn't been scared out of his wits that he was about to be thrown out of school, he would have been very pleased to have a chance to look around it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利环顾四周。有一点是可以确定的——在哈利这一年拜访过的所有老师办公室中，邓布利多的办公室绝对是最最有趣的。如果哈利不是因为担心自己会被赶出学校而吓得六神无主，他会觉得非常高兴有机会到这里来看看。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry hesitated. He cast a wary eye around the sleeping witches and wizards on the walls. Surely it couldn't hurt if he took the hat down and tried it on again? Just to see… just to make sure it had put him in the right House --</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利在犹豫。他警惕地看了看周围墙上那些熟睡的男女巫师。如果他把帽子拿下来，再戴在头上试试，肯定不会有什么妨碍吧？他只想看看…只想确定一下它把自己放在了合适的学院里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="哈利的心猛地往下一沉。他抓住帽顶，把它摘了下来。帽子软塌塌地悬在他手里，脏兮兮的，已经褪了色。哈利把它放回原来的搁板上，感到一阵恶心。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You've been wondering whether I put you in the right House," said the hat smartly. "Yes… you were particularly difficult to place. But I stand by what I said before" -- Harry's heart leapt -- "you would have done well in Slytherin --"</div>

<div class="line_en">"You're wrong," he said aloud to the still and silent hat. It didn't move. Harry backed away, watching it. Then a strange, gagging noise behind him made him wheel around.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你错了。”他大声对静静地待着、一言不发的帽子说。帽子没有动弹。哈利凝视着它，向后退去。突然后面传来一个奇怪的窒息般的声音，他猛地转过身来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He walked quietly around the desk, lifted the hat from its shelf, and lowered it slowly onto his head. It was much too large and slipped down over his eyes, just as it had done the last time he'd put it on. Harry stared at the black inside of the hat, waiting. Then a small voice said in his ear, "Bee in your bonnet, Harry Potter?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他悄悄绕过桌子，拿起搁板上的帽子，慢慢把它扣在头上。帽子太大了，滑下来盖住了他的眼睛，就像他第一次戴它时那样。哈利盯着帽子黑色的衬里，等待着。这时，一个小声音在他耳边说：“有事情想不明白，哈利·波特？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He wasn't alone after all. Standing on a golden perch behind the door was a decrepit-looking bird that resembled a half-plucked turkey. Harry stared at it and the bird looked balefully back, making its gagging noise again. Harry thought it looked very ill. Its eyes were dull and, even as Harry watched, a couple more feathers fell out of its tail.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="房间里根本不止他一个人。在门后一根高高的镀金栖枝上，站着一只老态龙钟的鸟，活像是一只被拔光了一半羽毛的火鸡。哈利盯着它，那鸟也用愁苦的目光望着他，同时又发出郡种窒息般的声音。哈利觉得它看上去病得很重。它的眼睛毫无神采，而且就在哈利望着它的这会儿工夫，又有几片羽毛从它尾巴上掉了下来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="哈利惊恐地叫喊，后退着撞到桌上。他焦急地环顾四周，指望能有一杯水什么的，可是没有看见。与此同时，那只鸟已经变成了一只火球，它惨叫一声，接着便消失了，只剩下地板上一堆还没有完全熄灭的灰烬。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It's a shame you had to see him on a Burning Day," said Dumbledore, seating himself behind his desk. "He's really very handsome most of the time, wonderful red and gold plumage. Fascinating creatures, phoenixes. They can carry immensely heavy loads, their tears have healing powers, and they make highly faithful pets."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“真遗憾，你不得不在涅槃日见到他，”邓布利多说着，在桌子后面坐了下来，“它大部分时间是非常漂亮的：全身都是令人称奇的红色和金色羽毛。凤凰真是十分奇特迷人的生命。它们能携带极为沉重的东西，它们的眼泪具有疗伤的作用，而且它们还是特别忠诚的宠物。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the shock of Fawkes catching fire, Harry had forgotten what he was there for, but it all came back to him as Dumbledore settled himself in the high chair behind the desk and fixed Harry with his penetrating, light-blue stare.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利在福克斯自焚引起的惊恐中，暂时忘记了他来这里的原因。可是此刻，当邓布利多在桌后的高背椅上坐下，用他浅蓝色的、具有穿透力的目光盯住他的时候，他一切都想起来了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Before Dumbledore could speak another word, however, the door of the office flew open with an almighty bang and Hagrid burst in, a wild look in his eyes, his balaclava perched on top of his shaggy black head and the dead rooster still swinging from his hand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，还没等邓布利多再开口说话，办公室的门砰的一声巨响，被人猛地推开。海格一头冲了进来，眼睛里喷着怒火，盔式帽戴在他黑乎乎、乱蓬蓬的头顶上，那只死公鸡还在他手里晃来晃去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry didn't know what to say. He thought of Malfoy shouting, "You'll be next, Mudbloods!" and of the Polyjuice Potion simmering away in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. Then he thought of the disembodied voice he had heard twice and remembered what Ron had said: "Hearing voices no one else can hear isn't a good sign, even in the wizarding world." He thought, too, about what everyone was saying about him, and his growing dread that he was somehow connected with Salazar Slytherin…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利不知道该怎么说。他想起了马尔福的叫喊：“下一个就轮到你们了，泥巴种！”想起了复方汤剂还在哭泣的桃金娘的盥洗室里慢慢熬着。接着，他又想起了他曾两次听见的那个幽灵的声音，想起罗恩说的话：“听见别人听不见的声音，这不是一个好兆头，即使在魔法世界里也是这样。”他还想起了大家议论他的话，以及他越来越强烈的担心，生怕自己与萨拉查斯莱特林存在什么关系…">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The double attack on Justin and Nearly Headless Nick turned what had hitherto been nervousness into real panic. Curiously, it was Nearly Headless Nick's fate that seemed to worry people most. What could possibly do that to a ghost? people asked each other; what terrible power could harm someone who was already dead? There was almost a stampede to book seats on the Hogwarts Express so that students could go home for Christmas.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="贾斯廷和差点没头的尼克双双遭到袭击，这使原本已经紧张不安的气氛变得真正恐慌起来。说来奇怪，最使人们感到恐慌的倒是差点没头的尼克的遭遇。什么东西能对一个幽灵下此毒手呢，人们互相询问：什么可怕的力量能够伤害一个已经死去的人呢？学生们差不多是争先恐后地去预订霍格沃茨特快列车的座位，盼着可以回家过圣诞节。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Crabbe and Goyle, who always did whatever Malfoy did, had signed up to stay over the holidays, too. But Harry was glad that most people were leaving. He was tired of people skirting around him in the corridors, as though he were about to sprout fangs or spit poison; tired of all the muttering, pointing, and hissing as he passed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克拉布和高尔一向是马尔福做什么，他们就做什么，所以也在留校过节的名单上签了名。不过，哈利倒很高兴大部分学生都离校。他已经厌倦了人们在走廊上躲着他走，好像他随时都会长出潦牙，喷出毒汁；也厌倦了每当他走过时，人们都要指指点点、嘀嘀咕咕地议论他。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At last the term ended, and a silence deep as the snow on the grounds descended on the castle. Harry found it peaceful, rather than gloomy, and enjoyed the fact that he, Hermione, and the Weasleys had the run of Gryffindor Tower, which meant they could play Exploding Snap loudly without bothering anyone, and practice dueling in private. Fred, George, and Ginny had chosen to stay at school rather than visit Bill in Egypt with Mr. and Mrs. Weasley. Percy, who disapproved of what he termed their childish behavior, didn't spend much time in the Gryffindor common room. He had already told them pompously that he was only staying over Christmas because it was his duty as a prefect to support the teachers during this troubled time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="终于，学期结束了，像地上的积雪一般厚重的寂静，笼罩了整个城堡。哈利不觉得沉闷，反而觉得很宁静，一想到他、赫敏和韦斯莱兄妹可以在格兰芬多城堡里随意进出，他就感到很开心。这意味着他们可以大声玩噼啪爆炸而不妨碍任何人，还可以秘密地演习决斗。弗雷德、乔治和金妮决定留在学校，而不和韦斯莱夫妇一起去埃及看比尔。珀西对他们的这些孩子气行为不以为然，便很少待在格兰芬多的公共休息室里。珀西曾经很自负地告诉他们，他之所以留下来过圣诞节，只是因为他作为全优生，有责任在这段动荡的时期支持老师的工作。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The rest of Harry's Christmas presents were far more satisfactory. Hagrid had sent him a large tin of treacle toffee, which Harry decided to soften by the fire before eating; Ron had given him a book called Flying with the Cannons, a book of interesting facts about his favorite Quidditch team, and Hermione had bought him a luxury eagle-feather quill. Harry opened the last present to find a new, hand-knitted sweater from Mrs. Weasley and a large plum cake. He read her card with a fresh surge of guilt, thinking about Mr. Weasley's car (which hadn't been seen since its crash with the Whomping Willow), and the bout of rule-breaking he and Ron were planning next. No one, not even someone dreading taking Polyjuice Potion later, could fail to enjoy Christmas dinner at Hogwarts.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Great Hall looked magnificent. Not only were there a dozen frost-covered Christmas trees and thick streamers of holly and mistletoe crisscrossing the ceiling, but enchanted snow was falling, warm and dry, from the ceiling. Dumbledore led them in a few of his favorite carols, Hagrid booming more and more loudly with every goblet of eggnog he consumed. Percy, who hadn't noticed that Fred had bewitched his prefect badge so that it now read "Pinhead," kept asking them all what they were sniggering at. Harry didn't even care that Draco Malfoy was making loud, snide remarks about his new sweater from the Slytherin table. With a bit of luck, Malfoy would be getting his comeuppance in a few hours' time.</div>
