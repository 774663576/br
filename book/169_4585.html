<div class="line_en">The courtiers were brightly colored mice below. Great lords and proud ladies knelt before her. Bold young knights laid their swords at her feet and pleaded for her favors, and the queen smiled down at them. Until the dwarf appeared as if from nowhere, pointing at her and howling with laughter. The lords and ladies began to chuckle too, hiding their smiles behind their hands. Only then did the queen realize she was naked.</div>

<div class="line_en">Horrified, she tried to cover herself with her hands. The barbs and blades of the Iron Throne bit into her flesh as she crouched to hide her shame. Blood ran red down her legs, as steel teeth gnawed at her buttocks. When she tried to stand, her foot slipped through a gap in the twisted metal. The more she struggled the more the throne engulfed her, tearing chunks of flesh from her breasts and belly, slicing at her arms and legs until they were slick and red, glistening.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她惶恐地试图用双手遮掩，去维持那份女人的羞耻，结果铁王座上的倒钩和纠结割破了她柔嫩光滑的皮肤，鲜血流下大腿，钢牙咬紧屁股。她想站起来，脚却踩在扭曲金属的隙缝里，挣脱不开，越是挣扎，铁王座就越是无情地要将她吞没。这张驼背怪物撕开她双乳和腹部的血肉，切掉四肢，直到整个变得血淋淋、滑溜溜、闪闪发光。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His merriment still echoed in her ears when she felt a light touch on her shoulder, and woke suddenly. For half a heartbeat the hand seemed part of the nightmare, and Cersei cried out, but it was only Senelle. The maid's face was white and frightened.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当有人轻触她肩膀，令她即刻惊醒时，侏儒的笑声仍在耳畔回荡。莫非这只手也是噩梦的一部分？瑟曦开口尖叫，把手的主人—侍女塞蕾娜—吓得面色苍白，六神无主。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Your Grace." The voice was not her brother's. "The Lord Commander said come get you." His hair curled, as Jaime's did, but her brother's hair was beaten gold, like hers, where this man's was black and oily. She stared at him, confused, as he muttered about a privy and a crossbow, and said her father's name. I am dreaming still, Cersei thought. I have not woken, nor has my nightmare ended. Tyrion will creep out from under the bed soon and begin to laugh at me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“陛下，”低语声不属于詹姆，“队长大人命我前来知会您。”他的头发跟詹姆一样卷曲，然而弟弟有溶金的颜色，与她无异，这男人的发丝则又腻又黑。她注视着对方，倾听关于厕所、十字弓和父亲的话题，迷惑不解。我的梦还没醒，瑟曦认定，我还在噩梦中挣扎，等我醒来，提利昂就会从床下爬出，开始嘲笑我了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We are not alone, the queen realized. Shadows loomed around her bed, tall shapes with chainmail glimmering beneath their cloaks. Armed men had no business here. Where are my guards? Her bedchamber was dark, but for the lantern one of the intruders held on high. I must show no fear. Cersei pushed back sleep-tousled hair, and said, "What do you want of me?" A man stepped into the lantern light, and she saw his cloak was white. "Jaime?" I dreamt of one brother, but the other has come to wake me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这里还有其他人，太后意识到。床前阴影憧憧，高大男子们身披的斗篷下，锁甲反射光芒。他们怎敢拿着兵器闯进我的卧室？侍卫何在？卧室内光线昏暗，只有一位闯入者提着一盏油灯。我不能在他们面前显露恐惧，于是瑟曦收拢蓬乱的头发，“你们想干嘛？”一个男人应声踱到灯光下，她发现此人的斗篷乃是白色。“詹姆？”梦见的是一个弟弟，来的却是另一个弟弟。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But that was folly. Her dwarf brother was down in the black cells, condemned to die this very day. She looked down at her hands, turning them over to make certain all her fingers were still there. When she ran a hand down her arm the skin was covered with gooseprickles, but unbroken. There were no cuts on her legs, no gashes on the soles of her feet. A dream, that's all it was, a dream. I drank too much last night, these fears are only humors born of wine. I will be the one laughing, come dusk. My children will be safe, Tommen's throne will be secure, and my twisted little valonqar will be short a head and rotting.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而这都是蠢念头，她的侏儒弟弟此刻被关在黑牢里，今天即将明正典刑。她低头仔细打量双手，确保每个指头都在，再摸摸身体，皮肤起了鸡皮疙瘩，却没有划破割伤。腿上没有疤痕，脚底没有创口。梦，只是梦，梦。我昨晚喝得太多，葡萄酒放大了幻影。黎明到来时，我才该是那个笑到最后的人。我的孩子们将永保平安，托曼的王位会流传万代，而我那该死、卑劣、矮小的Valongar将人头落地，在地狱里腐烂。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She rose, and let Senelle slip a bedrobe over her shoulders to hide her nakedness. Cersei belted it herself, her fingers stiff and clumsy. "My lord father keeps guards about him, night and day," she said. Her tongue felt thick. She took another swallow of lemon water and sloshed it round her mouth to freshen her breath. A moth had gotten into the lantern Ser Boros was holding; she could hear it buzzing and see the shadow of its wings as it beat against the glass.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她猛然起身，任塞蕾娜用睡袍盖住她的裸体，再亲手系好袍子，只觉指头僵硬又笨拙。“我父亲大人日日夜夜都有亲兵守卫。”瑟曦宣布，嗓音有些浑浊，于是再含了口柠檬水，在口中搅拌，以提振精神。一只飞蛾发现了柏洛斯爵士的灯，她看见翅膀晃动的影子，昆虫嗡嗡地拍打玻璃，寻找光明。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jocelyn Swyft was at her elbow, pressing a cup on her. Cersei took a sip: water, mixed with lemon squeezings, so tart she spit it out. She could hear the night wind rattling the shutters, and she saw with a strange sharp clarity. Jocelyn was trembling like a leaf, as frightened as Senelle. Ser Osmund Kettleblack loomed over her. Behind him stood Ser Boros Blount, with a lantern. At the door were Lannister guardsmen with gilded lions shining on the crests of their helmets. They looked afraid as well. Can it be? the queen wondered. Can it be true?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="乔斯琳·史威佛走到床边，将杯子凑过来。瑟曦吮了一口，加柠檬汁的水，太酸，于是便吐掉了。夜风敲打着窄窗，发出“吱噶吱噶”的响声，令她感到奇特地宁静。身边的乔斯琳如树叶一样颤抖，塞蕾娜也很害怕，奥斯蒙·凯特布莱克爵士笼罩在面前，后方是提灯的柏洛斯·布劳恩爵士，门边有大批戴狮盔的兰尼斯特卫兵，盔顶的黄金狮子隐隐反光。他们都在恐惧。是真的吗？太后不相信，这是真的吗？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">By the time they left Maegor's Holdfast, the sky had turned a deep cobalt blue, though the stars still shone. All but one, Cersei thought. The bright star of the west has fallen, and the nights will be darker now. She paused upon the drawbridge that spanned the dry moat, gazing down at the spikes below. They would not dare lie to me about such a thing. "Who found him?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="离开梅葛楼时，天色已转为深深的钴蓝，但星星仍在闪耀。一颗明星的陨落，瑟曦心想，西方最明亮夺目的星星已然沉沦，未来的道路将更为黑暗。她在跨越干涸护城河的吊桥中央停步，注视着下方的尖刺。是真的，他们不敢拿这个骗我。“谁发现的？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">No, that cannot be. That is not the way a lion dies. The queen felt strangely calm. She remembered the first time she had lost a tooth, when she was just a little girl. It hadn't hurt, but the hole in her mouth felt so odd she could not stop touching it with her tongue.</div>

<div class="line_en">The rising sun had painted the tower tops a vivid red, but beneath the walls the night still huddled. The outer castle was so hushed that she could have believed all its people dead. They should be. It is not fitting for Tywin Lannister to die alone. Such a man deserves a retinue to attend his needs in hell.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="初升的朝阳为塔楼顶端点缀了鲜艳的绯红，但下面的城墙仍在黑夜之中，外城如此静谧，她不禁怀疑其中的居民是否都已死去。他们都该死。泰温·兰尼斯特不应独自去世，即便下地狱，他也配拉上一大帮庸人作陪葬。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">If Tywin Lannister was truly dead, no one was safe… least of all her son upon his throne. When the lion falls the lesser beasts move in: the jackals and the vultures and the feral dogs. They would try to push her aside, as they always had. She would need to move quickly, as she had when Robert died. This might be the work of Stannis Baratheon, through some catspaw. It could well be the prelude to another attack upon the city. She hoped it was. Let him come. I will smash him, just as Father did, and this time he will die. Stannis did not frighten her, no more than Mace Tyrell did. No one frightened her. She was a daughter of the Rock, a lion. There will be no more talk of forcing me to wed again. Casterly Rock was hers now, and all the power of House Lannister. No one would ever disregard her again. Even when Tommen had no further need of a regent, the Lady of Casterly Rock would remain a power in the land.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果泰温·兰尼斯特真的死了，全家都不再安全…尤其是她称王的儿子。狮子倒下，百兽纷起，豺狼虎豹将趁虚而入。他们要推翻她，他们一直都想推翻她，所以她必须当机立断，立刻行动，一如劳勃去世那回。这也可能是史坦尼斯·拜拉席恩的阴谋，他与城内贼人串通，然后趁乱再打都城。让他来吧！瑟曦心想，我将粉碎他，和父亲一样，并且这次要他的命！说到底，史坦尼斯或梅斯·提利尔有什么好怕的？没人能使她恐惧。她是凯岩城的女儿，狮子的女儿。而且再也没有包办婚姻了。凯岩城是我的，兰尼斯特家族的力量也是我的，没人能使她恐惧。即便将来托曼不再需要摄政王太后，身为大诸侯，我仍能左右朝纲。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Four spearmen in red cloaks and lion-crested helms were posted at the door of the Tower of the Hand. "No one is to enter or leave without my permission," she told them. The command came easily to her. My father had steel in his voice as well.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="四名红袍狮盔的卫兵守在首相塔门前。“未经我准许，谁也不得擅自出入。”瑟曦吩咐。下令对她而言是件容易事。但我还欠缺父亲声音里钢铁般的意志。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Within the tower, the smoke from the torches irritated her eyes, but Cersei did not weep, no more than her father would have. I am the only true son he ever had. Her heels scraped against the stone as she climbed, and she could still hear the moth fluttering wildly inside Ser Osmund's lantern.

His bedrobe was hiked up around his chest, leaving him naked below the waist.

More was congealing in his navel.</div>

Should I scream and tear my hair? They said Catelyn Stark had clawed her own face to bloody ribbons when the Freys slew her precious Robb. Would you like that, Father? she wanted to ask him. Or would you want me to be strong? Did you weep for your own father? Her grandfather had died when she was only a year old, but she knew the story. Lord Tytos had grown very fat, and his heart burst one day when he was climbing the steps to his mistress. Her father was off in King's Landing when it happened, serving as the Mad King's Hand. Lord Tywin was often away in King's Landing when she and Jaime were young. If he wept when they brought him word of his father's death, he did it where no one could see the tears.</div>
