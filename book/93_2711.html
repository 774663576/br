<div class="line_en">Still wrong. It's transparent to me that he was carrying a weapon. On closer observation, big guy was likewise sort of leaning against the counter and in an instant I knew that he was using his weight to jam his gun between him and the counter. A robbery was about to happen.</div>

<div class="line_en">This was a common place for me but today I discerned there was something wrong when I turned around. Wrong means not right. There were two men in the bank now, a big guy just inside the door and a smaller one more like a skeleton in the middle of the floor.</div>

<div class="line_en">If I attacked the small guy, I'd be easily picked off by the big guy as I struggled to get small guy's gun. If I walked casually by, and seized the big guy, the small guy would shoot the customers around him and take some nice-looking teller as a hostage.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果我攻击小家伙，我会很容易被大家伙选中，因为我争取小家伙的枪。如果我漫不经心地走过，抓住那个大个子，那个小个子就会向他周围的顾客开枪，然后把一个长得不错的出纳员当作人质。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Big guy was leafing through the leaflets on the counter, but his eyes were on the door and the eyes of the small guy never stopped moving and were scouting the scope and layout of the room, his head moved like that of a tennis fan sitting at the net.</div>

<div class="line_en">As I walked by, the small guy started to move. He swung back his coat and revealed a pistol and started to yell, "Attention, everybody!" The small guy was too busy to finish the second word. In the instant an idea flashed into my mind,"why the big coat for such a small gun", then thought "winter" again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我走过的时候，那个小个子开始动了。他脱下外套，掏出一把手枪，开始大喊：“大家注意了！”小个子忙得连第二个字都写不完。这时，一个念头闪入我的脑海，“为什么这么小的枪要穿这么大的外套”，然后又想到“冬天”。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The situation was urgent. It was better to leave and call for immediate assistance. Assistance? I wasn't a soldier any more. I had been retired. Better to call the police, as normal people do. I could be anonymous then.</div>

<div class="line_en">Fortunately for me, it was not I that stopped him but a keen security guard who'd obviously seen the same signs I had. Fortunate for me, but unfortunate for the security- man. He hadn't noted that the big guy was an accomplice. After an interval of a few seconds, he fired a pistol at the back of the guard's head as he walked over to check on the dead small guy. He fell on the body of the small guy, blood streamed down from his wound.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对我来说幸运的是，并不是我阻止了他，而是一个敏锐的保安，他显然看到了和我一样的征兆。对我来说是幸运的，但对保安来说是不幸的。他没有注意到那个大个子是共犯。过了几秒钟，他朝警卫的后脑开了一枪，当时他正走过去检查那个死去的小家伙。他倒在那个小个子的身上，血从他的伤口流了下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Big guy stood there, momentarily as if deciding what to do. His eyes were a little wild but not scared. I thought again about rushing at him, but the distance was too great. Better to wait. All around me, people were screaming and moaning in shock and some people were already lying on the ground, anticipating the big guy's next instruction. The screaming did not bother him, which was both good and bad. It was good because the cool gunman was unlikely to shoot unnecessarily and bad because he would shoot without pausing if the situation required it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大个子站在那里，瞬间好像在决定要做什么。他的眼神有点狂野，但并不害怕。我又想冲向他，但是距离太远了。最好等一等。在我周围，人们惊恐地尖叫着呻吟着，一些人已经躺在地上，等待着大块头的下一个指示。尖叫声并没有打扰到他，这是好事也是坏事。这是好事，因为冷静的枪手不太可能开不必要的枪，也不会开坏枪，因为如果情况需要，他会毫不停顿地开枪。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He gave an imperative order, "If everybody does what I say, no one will get hurt. This is just a robbery gone wrong and I want to use you good people as hostages so that I can get away!" He didn't have to say any more than that. We'd all seen in perspective what had happened and knew he could kill some of us. The "hostage" in his short speech made it clear that he was saying he would threaten to kill hostages if his demands were not met.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他下了一道命令：“如果每个人都按我说的做，就没有人会受伤。这只是一起抢劫案，我想用你们这些好人做人质，这样我就可以逃走了！”他不用再多说什么了。我们都清楚地看到发生了什么，知道他可能会杀死我们中的一些人。这位“人质”在他的简短讲话中明确表示，如果他的要求得不到满足，他将威胁要杀死人质。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It seemed there was chaos in the place. The only ones standing silent were him and me. For a moment, our eyes met and gazed at each other. Did he know me? How could he? The sound of the approaching alarms broke our gaze and the big guy calmly and loudly instructed everybody to lie on the floor. I did as he bade, but taking as many steps forward as I dared before lying down. I was no more than five yards from him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这里似乎一片混乱。唯一保持沉默的只有他和我。有那么一会儿，我们的目光相遇，彼此凝视。他认识我吗？他怎么能这样？警报声越来越近，打断了我们的视线，这个大家伙平静而大声地命令所有人趴在地上。我照他吩咐的做了，但是在躺下之前，我尽可能地向前走了几步。我离他不到五码。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The police arrived and contact was made straight away. He said that he would kill a hostage every ten minutes until he was given a clear passage to the private airways strip, where a helicopter was to take him to Cuba. He would bring hostages along with him as insurance against any unpredictable trouble.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="警察赶到后立即联系了他们。他说，他将每十分钟杀死一名人质，直到他获得通往私营航空公司跑道的安全通道，在那里有一架直升飞机将他带到古巴。他会随身携带人质以防万一。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I could see he would act for the ultimate aim -- to kill a kid and to make them know he was serious. I couldn't let the tragedy happen. Could I hide and wait and let all this happen and walk away? All my training said I could. "Bad things will happen around you", said the Controller. "Terrible things. But if it doesn't happen to you, it's not your liability to stop them. " I had seen terrible things and walked away. But not today.</div>

<div class="line_en">As the first ten-minute deadline approached, the big guy scanned the hostages in front of him. His eyes touched mine, but he moved on, looking for something. "You! Kid!"
