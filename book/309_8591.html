<div class="line_en">The authorities' problem with the book was obvious. The protagonist was a Jew, and he was presented in a positive light. Unforgivable. He was a rich man who was tired of letting life pass him by -- what he referred to as the shrugging of the shoulders to the problems and pleasures of a person's time on earth.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Shoulder Shrug, she decided, was excellent. Each night, when she calmed herself from her nightmare, she was soon pleased that she was awake and able to read. "A few pages?"

<div class="line_en">In the early part of summer in Molching, as Liesel and Papa made their way through the book, this man was traveling to Amsterdam on business, and the snow was shivering outside. The girl loved that -- the shivering snow. "That's exactly what it does when it comes down," she told Hans Hubermann. They sat together on the bed, Papa half asleep and the girl wide awake.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那一年的初夏，莉泽尔和爸爸在书中缓慢前行。主人公到阿姆斯特丹出差，雪花颤抖着飘落。莉泽尔喜欢这个表述：颤抖的雪花。她告诉汉斯·胡伯曼，雪花落下来的时候确实是这个样子。他们一起坐在床上，爸爸半睡半醒，女孩则清醒异常。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sometimes she watched Papa as he slept, knowing both more and less about him than either of them realized.

<div class="line_cn" title="他回头瞧了一眼。“好吧，既然你都这么说了，”他微微一笑，“那你赶紧送衣服去吧。”然后他转头跑开，加入了球队。走到希默尔街的尽头，莉泽尔回过头来，看到鲁迪正站在靠近她这一边的球门前，在朝她挥手。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“蠢猪。”她笑了。当莉泽尔也抬起手时，她心里明明白白地知道，他肯定也在叫她小母猪。对十一岁的孩子来说，我想这已经算是爱了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The mayor's wife, having let the girl in for the fourth time, was sitting at the desk, simply watching the books. On the second visit, she had given permission for Liesel to pull one out and go through it, which led to another and another, until up to half a dozen books were stuck to her, either clutched beneath her arm or among the pile that was climbing higher in her remaining hand.</div>

<div class="line_en">On this occasion, as Liesel stood in the cool surrounds of the room, her stomach growled, but no reaction was forthcoming from the mute, damaged woman. She was in her bathrobe again, and although she observed the girl several times, it was never for very long. She usually paid more attention to what was next to her, to something missing. The window was opened wide, a square cool mouth, with occasional gusty surges.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这一次，莉泽尔坐在书房中央，感到四周有些阴冷，肚子也发出抱怨声，但那个沉默而忧郁的女人没有任何反应。今天，她又穿着浴袍，尽管好几次把目光投向女孩，却不会停留太久。她通常更关注她身边的某样东西，某个不见了的东西。窗户大敞着，变成了一个四四方方的口子，时不时有阵阵寒风汹涌而来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As summer set in, the roomful of books became warmer, and with every pickup or delivery day the floor was not as painful. Liesel would sit with a small pile of books next to her, and she'd read a few paragraphs of each, trying to memorize the words she didn't know, to ask Papa when she made it home. Later on, as an adolescent, when Liesel wrote about those books, she no longer remembered the titles. Not one. Perhaps had she stolen them, she would have been better equipped.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="随着夏天的到来，书房变得越来越温暖，在每个送衣服或取衣服的日子，书房的地板也不再那么硌人。莉泽尔会在身边放一小摞书，每一本都读上几段，背诵那些不认识的单词，回家后再向爸爸求教。后来，长大后的莉泽尔回过头来写下这段关于读书的回忆时，她已经不记得那些书名了。一个都不记得。如果偷走它们的话，她会更深刻地将它们留存在记忆里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Goodbye, Frau Hermann." The words always came as a shock. "Thank you." After which the woman paid her and she left. Every movement was accounted for, and the book thief ran home.</div>

<div class="line_en">She could have shot herself, scratched herself, or indulged in other forms of self-mutilation, but she chose what she probably felt was the weakest option -- to at least endure the discomfort of the weather. For all Liesel knew, she prayed for summer days that were cold and wet. For the most part, she lived in the right place.</div>

<div class="line_en">The mayor's wife was just one of a worldwide brigade. You have seen her before, I'm certain. In your stories, your poems, the screens you like to watch.

<div class="line_en">When Liesel left that day, she said something with great uneasiness. In translation, two giant words were struggled with, carried on her shoulder, and dropped as a bungling pair at Ilsa Hermann's feet. They fell off sideways as the girl veered with them and could no longer sustain their weight. Together, they sat on the floor, large and loud and clumsy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那一天，莉泽尔在告辞时心神不宁地说出了三个字。它们压在她的肩头，摇摇晃晃，又被她笨手笨脚地摔在伊尔莎·赫尔曼面前。女孩挣扎了一番，再也扛不住它们的重量，只好让它们掉下来。它们就这样一起落在了地上，庞大、笨重又吵闹。">查看中文翻译</div>

It happened every time she deciphered a new word or pieced together a sentence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莉泽尔有时候想，自己也许不该打搅这个女人，但伊尔莎·赫尔曼引起了她的兴趣，那些书的吸引力也强大无比。曾经，文字令莉泽尔束手无策，可如今她坐在地板上，而镇长太太坐在丈夫的书桌前，她总能体会到一种与生俱来的力量。每一次，当她破译了一个新词或是读通一个句子，这种感受就会浮上心头。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">On top of the rationing situation, his father's business wasn't doing so well of late (the threat of Jewish competition was taken away, but so were the Jewish customers). The Steiners were scratching things together to get by. Like many other people on the Himmel Street side of town, they needed to trade. Liesel would have given him some food from her place, but there wasn't an abundance of it there, either. Mama usually made pea soup. On Sunday nights she cooked it -- and not just enough for one or two repeat performances. She made enough pea soup to last until the following Saturday. Then on Sunday, she'd cook another one. Pea soup, bread, sometimes a small portion of potatoes or meat. You ate it up and you didn't ask for more, and you didn't complain.</div>

After a game of soccer, both Liesel and Rudy learned the benefits of keeping their eyes open. Sitting on Rudy's front step, they noticed Fritz Hammer -- one of their older counterparts -- eating an apple. It was of the Klar variety -- ripening in July and August -- and it looked magnificent in his hand. Three or four more of them clearly bulged in his jacket pockets. They wandered closer.</div>
