<div class="line_en">The model was similar to what was being used at Teach for America, which itself was relatively new at the time: Public Allies recruited talented young people, gave them intensive training and committed mentorship, and placed them in paid ten-month apprentice positions inside community organizations and public agencies, the hope being that they'd flourish and contribute in meaningful ways. The broader aim was that these opportunities would give the recruits -- Allies, we called them -- both the experience and the drive to continue working in the nonprofit or public sector for years to come, thereby helping to build a new generation of community leaders.</div>

<div class="line_en">My new job made me nervous. I'd been hired to be the executive director for the brand-new Chicago chapter of an organization called Public Allies, which itself was basically brand-new. It was something like a start-up inside a start-up, and in a field in which I had no professional experience to speak of. Public Allies had been founded only a year earlier in Washington, D. C., and was the brainchild of Vanessa Kirsch and Katrina Browne, who were both just out of college and interested in helping more people find their way into careers in public service and nonprofit work. Barack had met the two of them at a conference and become a member of their board, eventually suggesting they get in touch with me regarding the job.</div>

<div class="line_en">Public Allies was all about promise -- finding it, nurturing it, and putting it to use. It was a mandate to seek out young people whose best qualities might otherwise be overlooked and to give them a chance to do something meaningful. To me, the job felt almost like destiny. For every moment I'd spent looking wistfully at the South Side from my forty-seventh-floor window at Sidley, here was an invitation, finally, to use what I knew. I had a sense of how much latent promise sat undiscovered in neighborhoods like my own, and I was pretty sure I'd know how to find it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“公众联盟”旨在挖掘潜质—发现它，培养它，让它得到发挥。它致力于挑选一些才华可能被忽视的年轻人，给他们提供做有意义的工作的机会。对我而言，这份工作就像是命运特意为我准备的。坐在盛德四十七层的办公室里，我曾有许多次惆怅地看着窗外的南城，而现在我终于有机会施展我的能力。我知道在像我长大的社区那样的地方有很多隐藏的人才没有被发现，我非常确信自己知道怎么去发现它。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For me, the idea resonated in a big way. I still remembered how during my senior year at Princeton so many of us had marched into MCAT and LSAT exams or suited up to interview for corporate training programs without once (at least in my case) considering or maybe even realizing that a wealth of more civic-minded job options existed. Public Allies was meant as a corrective to this, a means of widening the horizon for young people thinking about careers. But what I especially liked was that its founders were focused less on parachuting Ivy Leaguers into urban communities and more on finding and cultivating talent that was already there. You didn't need a college degree to become an Ally. You needed only a high school diploma or GED, to be older than seventeen and younger than thirty, and to have shown some leadership capability, even if thus far in life it had gone largely untapped.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个愿景引起了我很深的共鸣。我还记得在普林斯顿上大四那年，我的同学大部分要么在准备MCAT [1]和LSAT考试，要么穿上正装去面试公司管理培训生的岗位，从未考虑过甚至从未意识到还有很多公益性职位的存在（起码我是这样）。“公众联盟”存在的目的就是希望能改变当时这一状况，拓宽正在选择自己职业道路的年轻人的视野。我尤其欣赏的一点是：它的创始人不是想把常青藤名校的毕业生空降到城市的社区里，而是更注重发掘和培养当地的人才。你并不需要拿到大学学位才能成为盟友，你只需要有高中毕业证或者GED [2]证书，年龄在十七岁到三十岁之间，显示出了一定的领导能力，即使这一能力还未得到充分开发。【注：[1] MCAT（Medical College Admission Test），申请北美临床医学的学生必须参加的一项标准化考试。[2]美国的一种考试，叫“一般教育发展考试”（General Educational Development Tests），简称GED，也可以算是一种全美国承认的替代高中毕业文凭的考试。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Back in Washington, D. C., the Public Allies founders had mustered a fledgling class of fifteen Allies who were working in various organizations around the city. They'd also raised enough money to launch a new chapter in Chicago, becoming one of the first organizations to receive federal funding through the AmeriCorps service program created under President Clinton. Which is where I came into the picture, thrilled and anxious in equal parts. Negotiating the terms of the job, though, I'd had what maybe should have been an obvious revelation about nonprofit work: It doesn't pay. I was initially offered a salary so small, so far below what I was making working for the city of Chicago, which was already half of what I'd been earning as a lawyer, that I literally couldn't afford to say yes. Which led to a second revelation about certain nonprofits, especially young-person-driven start-ups like Public Allies, and many of the bighearted, tirelessly passionate people who work in them: Unlike me, it seemed they could actually afford to be there, their virtue discreetly underwritten by privilege, whether it was that they didn't have student loans to pay off or perhaps had an inheritance to someday look forward to and thus weren't worried about saving for the future.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在华盛顿，“公众联盟”的创始人当时已经招募了十五个没有经验的盟友，他们正在市里多家机构工作。他们还募集了足够的资金在芝加哥开办分会，成为第一批通过“美国志愿计划”获得联邦资助的组织，这个计划是在克林顿总统任内设立的。这就是我这份新工作的背景，我的心情可以说是喜忧参半。在谈工作条件时，我了解到非营利组织的一个不言自明的事实就是：它不盈利。起初谈的时候，给我的薪水少得可怜，比我在芝加哥市政厅的薪水还要低很多，而那已经是我做律师时薪水的一半儿了，这让我根本没有办法答应。后来，我对非营利组织特别是像“公众联盟”这样由年轻人创立的新组织，以及在里面工作的许多善良慷慨、充满激情的人，有了另一个发现：他们和我不同，似乎不需要考虑钱的问题，他们的美德都有优越的背景支撑—要么没有学生贷款要偿还，要么某一天会继承家族遗产，所以不必为未来储蓄。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As I contemplated the new job, my mind often traveled back to childhood, and in particular to the month or so I'd spent in the pencil-flying pandemonium of that second-grade class at Bryn Mawr Elementary, before my mother had the wherewithal to have me plucked out. In the moment, I'd felt nothing but relieved by my own good fortune. But as my luck in life seemed only to snowball from there, I thought more about the twenty or so kids who'd been marooned in that classroom, stuck with an uncaring and unmotivated teacher. I knew I was no smarter than any of them. I just had the advantage of an advocate. I thought about this more often now that I was an adult, especially when people applauded me for my achievements, as if there weren't a strange and cruel randomness to it all. Through no fault of their own, those second graders had lost a year of learning. I'd seen enough at this point to understand how quickly even small deficits can snowball, too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在我思考新工作时，我的思绪常常回到童年，特别是布林茅尔小学二年级时，在铅笔乱飞的嘈杂的教室里度过的一个月，后来我母亲想办法把我救了出来。当时，我只为自己的好运感到庆幸。但是当我人生的好运从那里开始滚雪球般越滚越大时，我开始更多地想到其他二十几个孩子，他们被困在那间教室里，跟着一个没有爱心也没有动力的老师。我知道我并不比他们中任何一个更聪明，我只是有后盾。后来我长大了，开始更多地想起这件事，特别是当别人为我取得的成就鼓掌时—好像这不是一个奇怪而令人痛苦的巧合。那些二年级的孩子，由于一个并非他们自己所犯的错误，失去了一年的学习时间。足够的阅历让我明白，即使是微小的差距也会像滚雪球般越滚越大。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It became clear that if I wanted to join the tribe, I'd have to negotiate my way in, asking for exactly what I needed in terms of salary, which was significantly more than Public Allies had expected to pay. This was simply my reality. I couldn't be shy or embarrassed about my needs. I still had roughly $600 of student debt to pay off each month on top of my regular expenses, and I was married to a man with his own load of law school loans to cover. The organization's leaders were almost disbelieving when I informed them how much I'd borrowed in order to get through school and what that translated to in terms of monthly debt, but they gamely went out and secured new funding that enabled me to come on board.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="事情明朗了，如果我想要加入，就要进行协商，提出我心目中最低的薪酬要求，而那要比“公众联盟”期望的高很多。但这就是我的现实。我不能对自己的需求感到难为情或羞愧。我当时每个月要还大约600美元的学生贷款，我嫁给的这个男人自己还有法学院的贷款要还。“公众联盟”的领导听到我学生贷款的总额以及相应的每月还款数额后，简直难以置信，但是他们努力到外面筹集了新的资金，让我最终能够加入。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And with that, I was off and running, eager to make good on the opportunity I'd been handed. This was my first chance ever, really, to build something basically from the ground up: Success or failure would depend almost entirely on my efforts, not those of my boss or anyone else. I spent the spring of 1993 working furiously to set up an office and hire a small staff so that we could have a class of Allies in place by the fall. We'd found cheap office space in a building on Michigan Avenue and managed to get a load of donated secondhand chairs and tables from a corporate consulting firm that was redecorating its offices.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就这样，我开始大展拳脚，迫切地想要充分利用这个机会做些事情。这是我人生第一个从零做起的工作机会：成功还是失败，完全取决于我的努力，而不是我的老板或其他任何人。1993年春天，我疯狂地投入工作，开设办公室，招募了几个员工，目标是秋天时就能招募到第一批盟友。我们在密歇根大道的一栋楼里找到一间租金便宜的办公室，一家当时正在重新装修办公室的企业咨询公司捐给我们一些二手桌椅。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Meanwhile, I leveraged more or less every connection Barack and I'd ever made in Chicago, seeking donors and people who could help us secure longer-term foundation support, not to mention anyone in the public service field who'd be willing to host an Ally in their organization for the coming year. Valerie Jarrett helped me arrange placements in the mayor's office and the city health department, where Allies would work on a neighborhood-based childhood immunization project. Barack activated his network of community organizers to connect us with legal aid, advocacy, and teaching opportunities. Various Sidley partners wrote checks and helped introduce me to key donors.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="同时，我把贝拉克和我在芝加哥所有的人脉关系捋了一遍，开始寻找捐赠者和能帮助我们获得基金会长期支持的人，还有那些愿意在第二年邀请盟友在他们的组织里工作的公共服务领域的人。瓦莱丽·贾勒特帮助我搞定了在市长办公室和市政卫生部门的实习岗位，在这些岗位上，盟友们将为一个社区层面的儿童免疫接种项目工作。贝拉克发动他社区组织者的网络，帮我们联系上了法律援助、游说和教学等工作机会。盛德的几个合伙人给我们写了支票，还介绍我认识了重要的捐赠者。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The most exciting part for me was finding the Allies themselves. With help from the national organization, we advertised for applicants on college campuses across the country while also looking for talent closer to home. My team and I visited community colleges and some of the big urban high schools around Chicago. We knocked on doors in the Cabrini-Green housing project, went to community meetings, and canvassed programs that worked with single mothers. We quizzed everyone we met, from pastors to professors to the manager of the neighborhood McDonald's, asking them to identify the most interesting young people they knew. Who were the leaders? Who was ready for something bigger than what he or she had? These were the people we wanted to encourage to apply, urging them to forget for a minute whatever obstacles normally made such things impossible, promising that as an organization we'd do what we could -- whether it was supplying a bus pass or a stipend for child care -- to help cover their needs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最让我兴奋的事情是寻找盟友。在总会的帮助下，我们在全国的大学校园里发广告，招募申请者，同时也在本地寻找。我和我的团队去了芝加哥的社区大学以及一些规模较大的市区高中。我们曾在卡布里尼－格林之家小区 [3]挨家挨户敲门，参加社区会议，争取一些对帮助单亲妈妈的计划的支持。我们询问认识的每一个人，从牧师到教授到社区麦当劳店的经理，请他们介绍身边认识的最有趣的年轻人给我们。谁有领导才能？谁准备好突破自己？我们想要鼓励这些人来申请，敦促他们暂时忘掉致使一些事情行不通的种种障碍，向他们承诺我们这个组织会尽全力帮助他们解决他们的需求，不管是提供一张公交卡，还是补贴一些抚养孩子的费用。【注：[3]卡布里尼－格林之家小区（Cabrini-Green Homes），是美国政府面向低收入群体开发的福利住房项目，犯罪率极高，治安状况糟糕。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">By fall, we had a cohort of twenty-seven Allies working all over Chicago, holding internships everywhere from city hall to a South Side community assistance agency to Latino Youth, an alternative high school in Pilsen. The Allies together were an eclectic, spirited group, loaded with idealism and aspirations and representing a broad swath of backgrounds. Among them we had a former gang member, a Latina woman who'd grown up in the southwest part of Chicago and had gone to Harvard, another woman in her early twenties who lived in the Robert Taylor Homes and was raising a child while also trying to save money for college, and a twenty-six-year-old from Grand Boulevard who'd left high school but had kept up his education with library books and later gone back to earn his diploma.</div>

<div class="line_en">Each Friday, the whole group of Allies gathered at one of our host agency's offices, taking a full day to debrief, connect, and go through a series of professional development workshops. I loved these days more than anything. I loved how the room got noisy as the Allies piled in, dumping their backpacks in the corner and peeling off layers of winter wear as they settled into a circle. I loved helping them sort through their issues, whether it was mastering Excel, figuring out how to dress for an office job, or finding the courage to voice their ideas in a roomful of better-educated, more confident people. I sometimes had to give an Ally less-than-pleasant feedback. If I'd heard reports of Allies being late to work or not taking their duties seriously, I was stern in letting them know that we expected better. When Allies grew frustrated with poorly organized community meetings or problematic clients at their agencies, I counseled them to keep perspective, reminding them of their own relative good fortune.</div>

<div class="line_en">Above all, though, we celebrated each new bit of learning or progress. And there was lots of it. Not all the Allies would go on to work in the nonprofit or public sectors and not everyone would manage to overcome the hurdles of coming from a less privileged background, but I've been amazed over time to see how many of our recruits did, in fact, succeed and commit themselves long term to serving a larger public good. Some became Public Allies staff themselves; some are now even leaders in government agencies and inside national nonprofit organizations. Twenty-five years after its inception, Public Allies is still going strong, with chapters in Chicago and two dozen other cities and thousands of alumni around the country. To know that I played some small part in that, helping to create something that's endured, is one of the most gratifying feelings I've had in my professional life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们会一起庆祝学到的每一样新东西，取得的每一点进步。这些有很多。不是所有的盟友都会留在非营利组织或者公共事业领域工作，不是每个人都能克服来自弱势背景的障碍，但是慢慢地，我看到许多盟友取得了成功，并长期投身于为更多人谋福利的工作。一些盟友成了“公众联盟”的工作人员，一些后来成为政府机构或全国性非营利组织的领导人。在成立二十五年后的今天，“公众联盟”依然在不断壮大，在芝加哥和其他二十几个城市都设立了分会，在全美国范围培养了数千位盟友。想到我曾为此做过微薄的贡献，帮助建立了一个生命力持久的组织，我就觉得那是我职业生涯中最满足的事情之一。">查看中文翻译</div>

I went to sleep each night thinking about what still needed to be done and opened my eyes every morning with my mental checklists for the day, the week, and the month ahead already made. After graduating our first class of twenty-seven Allies in the spring, we welcomed a new set of forty in the fall and continued to grow from there. In hindsight, I think of it as the best job I ever had, for how wonderfully on the edge I felt while I was doing it and for how even a small victory -- whether it was finding a good placement for a native Spanish speaker or sorting through someone's fears about working in an unfamiliar neighborhood -- had to be thoroughly earned.</div>

He was teaching a class on racism and the law at the University of Chicago Law School and working by day at his law firm, mostly on cases involving voting rights and employment discrimination. He still sometimes ran community-organizing workshops as well, leading a couple of Friday sessions with my cohort at Public Allies. Outwardly, it seemed like a perfect existence for an intellectual, civic-minded guy in his thirties who'd flatly turned down any number of more lucrative and prestigious options in favor of his principles. He'd done it, as far as I was concerned. He'd found a noble balance. He was a lawyer, a teacher, and also an organizer. And he was soon to be a published author, too.</div>

<div class="line_en">After returning from Bali, Barack had spent more than a year writing a second draft of his book during the hours he wasn't at one of his jobs. He worked late at night in a small room we'd converted to a study at the rear of our apartment -- a crowded, book-strewn bunker I referred to lovingly as the Hole. I'd sometimes go in, stepping over his piles of paper to sit on the ottoman in front of his chair while he worked, trying to lasso him with a joke and a smile, to tease him back from whatever far-off fields he'd been galloping through. He was good-humored about my intrusions, but only if I didn't stay too long.</div>

<div class="line_en">Barack, I've come to understand, is the sort of person who needs a hole, a closed-off little warren where he can read and write undisturbed. It's like a hatch that opens directly onto the spacious skies of his brain. Time spent there seems to fuel him. In deference to this, we've managed to create some version of a hole inside every home we've ever lived in -- any quiet corner or alcove will do. To this day, when we arrive at a rental house in Hawaii or on Martha's Vineyard, Barack goes off looking for an empty room that can serve as the vacation hole. There, he can flip between the six or seven books he's reading simultaneously and toss his newspapers on the floor. For him, the Hole is a kind of sacred high place, where insights are birthed and clarity comes to visit. For me, it's an off-putting and disorderly mess. One requirement has always been that the Hole, wherever it is, have a door so that I can shut it. For obvious reasons.</div>

<div class="line_en">Dreams from My Father was published, finally, in the summer of 1995. It got good reviews yet sold only modestly, but that was okay. The important thing was that Barack had managed to process his life story, snapping together the disparate pieces of his Afro-Kansan-Indonesian-Hawaiian-Chicagoan identity, writing himself into a sort of wholeness this way. I was proud of him. Through the narrative, he'd made a kind of literary peace with his phantom father. The work to get there had been one-sided, of course, with Barack alone trying to fill every gap and understand every mystery the senior Obama had ever created. But this was also in keeping with how he'd always done it anyway. Since the time he was a boy, I realized, he'd tried to carry everything all on his own.</div>

<div class="line_en">With the book finished, there was new space in his life, and -- also in keeping with who he'd always been -- Barack felt compelled to fill it immediately. On the personal side, he'd been coping with difficult news: His mother, Ann, had been diagnosed with ovarian cancer and had moved from Jakarta back to Honolulu for treatment. As far as we knew, she was getting good medical care, and the chemotherapy seemed to be working. Both Maya and Toot were helping look after her in Hawaii, and Barack checked in often. But her diagnosis had come late, after the cancer had advanced, and it was difficult to know what would happen. I knew this weighed heavily on Barack's mind.</div>

Could he? Was he? Should he? But ahead of these always came another question, posed by Barack himself, preliminary and supposedly preemptive when it came to running for office of any sort. The first time he asked it was on the day he'd let me know about Alice Palmer and her open seat and this notion he had that maybe he could be not just a lawyer/professor/organizer/author but all those things plus a state legislator as well: "What do you think about it, Miche?"</div>

Mayor Daley had been elected to a third term in the spring of 1995, and now everyone was gearing up for the 1996 election, in which Illinois would select a new U. S. senator and President Clinton would make his bid for a second term. More scandalously, we had a sitting U. S. congressman under investigation for sex crimes, leaving an opening for a new Democratic contender in the state's Second District, which included much of Chicago's South Side. A popular state senator named Alice Palmer, who represented Hyde Park and South Shore and whom Barack had gotten to know while working on Project VOTE!, had begun saying privately that she intended to run for it. Which, in turn, would leave her state senate seat vacant, opening up the possibility that Barack could run for it.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the case of the Illinois senate in 1996, my reasoning went like this: I didn't much appreciate politicians and therefore didn't relish the idea of my husband becoming one. Most of what I knew about state politics came from what I read in the newspaper, and none of it seemed especially good or productive. My friendship with Santita Jackson had given me a sense that politicians were often required to be away from home. In general, I thought of lawmakers almost like armored tortoises, leather-skinned, slow moving, thick with self-interest. Barack was too earnest, too full of valiant plans, in my opinion, to abide by the hardscrabble, drag-it-out rancor that went on inside the domed capitol downstate in Springfield.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就1996年伊利诺伊州的参议院来说，我的逻辑是这样的：我并不喜欢从政者，所以也不愿意让我的丈夫成为一名政客。我对州政治的了解大部分都来自报纸，没有一件事是良好而富有成效的。我和桑蒂塔·杰克逊的友谊给了我一种感觉，搞政治的人经常需要离家外出。总的来说，立法者在我的印象里就像带壳的乌龟，外皮很厚，行动缓慢，自私自利。在我看来，贝拉克太热心肠，满脑子都是大胆的计划，恐怕无法忍受在州南部的斯普林菲尔德 [6]那栋圆顶议会大厦下面的深仇积怨。【注：[6]斯普林菲尔德（Springfield），又称春田市，是美国伊利诺伊州的首府。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Barack was elected to the Illinois senate in November 1996 and sworn in two months later, at the start of the following year. To my surprise, I'd enjoyed watching the campaign unfold. I'd helped collect signatures to put him on the ballot, knocking on doors in my old neighborhood on Saturdays, listening to what residents had to say about the state and its government, all the things they thought needed fixing. For me, it was reminiscent of the weekends I'd spent as a child trailing my dad as he climbed up all those porch steps, going about his duties as a precinct captain. Beyond this, I wasn't much needed, and that suited me perfectly. I could treat campaigning like a hobby, picking it up when it was convenient, having some fun with it, and then getting back to my own work.</div>

<div class="line_en">Barack's mother had passed away in Honolulu shortly after he announced his candidacy. Her decline had been so swift that he hadn't made it there to say good-bye. This crushed him. It was Ann Dunham who'd introduced him to the richness of literature and the power of a well-reasoned argument. Without her, he wouldn't have felt the monsoon downpours in Jakarta or seen the water temples of Bali. He might never have learned to appreciate how easy and thrilling it was to jump from one continent to another, or how to embrace the unfamiliar. She was an explorer, an intrepid follower of her own heart. I saw her spirit in Barack in big and small ways. The pain of losing her sat lodged like a blade in both of us, right alongside the blade that had been embedded when we'd lost my dad.</div>

<div class="line_en">Now that it was winter and the legislature was in session, we were separated for a good part of every week. Barack drove four hours to Springfield on Monday nights and checked into a cheap hotel where a lot of the other legislators stayed, usually returning late on Thursday. He had a small office in the statehouse and a part-time staffer in Chicago. He'd scaled back his work at the law firm but as a way of keeping pace with our debts, he'd added more courses to his teaching load at the law school, scheduling classes for days he wasn't in Springfield and teaching more when the senate wasn't in session. We spoke on the phone every night he was downstate, comparing notes and swapping tales about our respective days. On Fridays, back in Chicago, we had a standing date night, usually meeting downtown at a restaurant called Zinfandel after we'd both finished up work.</div>

<div class="line_en">This was a golden time for us, for the balance of our marriage, him with his purpose and me with mine. During a single, early week of senate business in Springfield, Barack had introduced seventeen new bills -- possibly a record, and at the very least a measure of his eagerness to get something done. Some would ultimately pass, but most would get quickly picked off in the Republican-controlled chamber, downed by partisanship and a cynicism passed off as practicality among his new colleagues. I saw in those early months how, just as I'd predicted, politics would be a fight, and the fight would be wearying, involving standoffs and betrayals, dirty-deal makers and compromises that sometimes felt painful. But I saw, too, that Barack's own forecast had been correct as well. He was strangely suited to the tussle of lawmaking, calm inside the maelstrom, accustomed to being an outsider, taking defeats in his easy Hawaiian stride. He stayed hopeful, insistently so, convinced that some part of his vision would someday, somehow, manage to prevail. He was getting battered already, but it wasn't bothering him. It did seem he was built for this. He'd get dinged up and stay shiny, like an old copper pot.</div>

I knew he'd get there eventually and that my heart would leap as it always did, seeing him walk through the door and hand his winter coat off to the hostess before threading his way through the tables, grinning when his eyes finally landed on mine. He'd kiss me and then take off his suit jacket, draping it on the back of his chair before sitting down. My husband. The routine settled me. We ordered the same thing pretty much every Friday -- pot roast, Brussels sprouts, and mashed potatoes -- and when it came, we ate every bite.</div>

Like the position at Public Allies, this new job spoke to a reality I'd lived personally. As I'd told Art years earlier, the University of Chicago had always felt less attainable and less interested in me than the fancy East Coast schools I'd ultimately attended, a place with its back turned to the neighborhood.

No matter how hard we tried, we couldn't seem to come up with a pregnancy. For a while, I told myself it was simply an issue of access, the result of Barack's comings and goings from Springfield. Our attempts at procreation took place not in service of important monthly hormonal markers but rather in concert with the Illinois legislative schedule. This, I figured, was one thing we could try to fix.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="事实证明，两个彼此深爱、有着良好职业道德和强烈进取心的人并不能凭意志力怀孕。生孩子不是能打拼的事情。让人抓狂的是，就这件事而言，努力和回报之间没有必然的联系。对我和贝拉克来说，这一点不仅让人失望，也令人惊讶。不管我们多么努力地去尝试，都没能成功怀孕。有一段时间，我告诉自己这是概率问题，因为贝拉克频繁往来于斯普林菲尔德与芝加哥之间，我们尝试怀孕不是根据每月激素的峰值水平，而是根据伊利诺伊州议会的日程。我想，这一点，我们是可以尝试修正的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But our adjustments didn't work, even with Barack flooring it up the interstate after a late vote so that he could hit my ovulation window and even after the senate went into its summer recess and he was home and available full-time. After many years of taking careful precautions to avoid pregnancy, I was now singularly dedicated to the opposite endeavor. I treated it like a mission. We had one pregnancy test come back positive, which caused us both to forget every worry and swoon with joy, but a couple of weeks later I had a miscarriage, which left me physically uncomfortable and cratered any optimism we'd felt. Seeing women and their children walking happily along a street, I'd feel a pang of longing followed by a bruising wallop of inadequacy. The only comfort was that Barack and I were living only about a block from Craig and his wife, who now had two beautiful children, Leslie and Avery. I found solace in dropping by to play and read stories with them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，我们的调整并没有奏效。即使贝拉克在议会投票后已经很晚的时候，沿着州际公路全速开车赶回来，就为了赶上我的排卵期；即使议会夏天闭会期间，他一直在家，随叫随到。多年间我一直小心避孕，现在却在做完全相反的努力。我把怀孕当作一项使命。我们曾经成功怀上过一次，那让我们忘记了所有烦恼，欣喜若狂。但是几周后，我流产了，这既让我感到身体很不适，也毁掉了我们的乐观情绪。看到女人带着孩子在街上走，我心底感觉到一阵渴望的疼痛，紧随而至的是强烈的挫败感。唯一的安慰是，我家离克雷格家只有一个街区，他有两个漂亮的孩子—莱斯利和埃弗里，我到那里陪他们一起玩耍，给他们读故事，从中能得到一些安慰。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">One of these friends also steered me toward a fertility doctor whom she and her husband had used. Barack and I went in for exams, and when we later sat down with the doctor, he told us there was no discernible issue with either of us. The mystery of why we weren't getting pregnant would remain just that. He suggested that I try taking Clomid, a drug meant to stimulate egg production, for a couple of months. When that didn't work, he recommended we move to in vitro fertilization. We were inordinately lucky that my university health insurance would cover most of the bill.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="其中一个朋友还给我介绍了她和丈夫曾经看过的一位不孕不育科的医生。贝拉克和我去做了检查，我们后来跟医生坐下来谈时，他说我们两个没有什么明显的问题。至于为什么怀不上孩子，仍然是一个谜团。他建议我口服几个月的枸橼酸氯米芬，这是一种刺激排卵的药物。后来证明没有效果，他转而建议我们尝试做试管婴儿。非常幸运的是，芝加哥大学的医疗福利可以报销大部分治疗费用。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">If I were to start a file on things nobody tells you about until you're right in the thick of them, I might begin with miscarriages. A miscarriage is lonely, painful, and demoralizing almost on a cellular level. When you have one, you will likely mistake it for a personal failure, which it is not. Or a tragedy, which, regardless of how utterly devastating it feels in the moment, it also is not. What nobody tells you is that miscarriage happens all the time, to more women than you'd ever guess, given the relative silence around it. I learned this only after I mentioned that I'd miscarried to a couple of friends, who responded by heaping me with love and support and also their own miscarriage stories. It didn't take away the pain, but in unburying their own struggles, they steadied me during mine, helping me see that what I'd been through was no more than a normal biological hiccup, a fertilized egg that, for what was probably a very good reason, had needed to bail out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果我要列一个清单，关于直到身陷其中才有人告诉你的事情，那么第一个就是流产。流产会让你身体的每个细胞都感到孤独、痛苦和意志消沉。如果你有这个经历，你可能会错将它视为个人的失败，但它不是的。或者你会认为这是一个悲剧，然而不管当时你有多么崩溃，它都不是的。没人告诉你的是：流产是司空见惯的事情，很多女性都有这种经历，而且人数比你想象的要多得多，只不过大家都不说而已。我知道这一点是在我告诉几个朋友我流产的事之后，她们用爱和支持来回应我，并告诉我她们流产的故事。这并没有带走我的痛苦，但是听了她们曾经的挣扎，我也能保持平静，认识到我经历的不过是一次正常的生理挫折，一颗受精卵也许有很充分的理由退出。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It felt like having a high-stakes lottery ticket, only with science involved. By the time the preliminary medical work was finished, rather unfortunately, the state legislature had returned to its fall session, swallowing up my sweet, attentive husband and leaving me largely on my own to manipulate my reproductive system into peak efficiency. This would involve giving myself a regimen of daily shots over the course of several weeks. The plan was I'd administer first one drug to suppress my ovaries and then later a new drug to stimulate them, the idea being that they'd then produce a cascade of viable eggs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这感觉是在买一种高风险的彩票，只是有科学的因素在内。很不走运的是，我们做完初步检查后，州议会的秋季会议开始了，带走了我亲爱的体贴的丈夫，留下我独自一人操控自己的生殖系统以达到最佳状态。我需要连续几周每天给自己注射一针。根据计划，我需要先注射一种药物抑制排卵，然后再注射另一种药物刺激排卵，这样就能够产生很多能存活的卵子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">All the work and uncertainty involved made me anxious, but I wanted a baby. It was a need that had been there forever. As a girl, when I'd grown tired of kissing the vinyl skin of my baby dolls, I'd begged my mother to have another baby, a real one, just for me. I promised I'd do all the work. When she wouldn't go along with the plan, I'd hunted through her underwear drawer, searching for her birth control pills, figuring that if I confiscated them, maybe it would yield some results. It didn't, obviously, but the point is I'd been waiting a long time for this. I wanted a family and Barack wanted a family, too, and now here I was alone in the bathroom of our apartment, trying, in the name of all that want, to screw up the courage to plunge a syringe into my thigh.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was maybe then that I felt a first flicker of resentment involving politics and Barack's unshakable commitment to the work. Or maybe I was just feeling the acute burden of being female. Either way, he was gone and I was here, carrying the responsibility. I sensed already that the sacrifices would be more mine than his. In the weeks to come, he'd go about his regular business while I went in for daily ultrasounds to monitor my eggs. He wouldn't have his blood drawn. He wouldn't have to cancel any meetings to have a cervix inspection. He was doting and invested, my husband, doing what he could do. He read all the IVF literature and would talk to me all night about it, but his only actual duty was to show up at the doctor's office and provide some sperm. And then, if he chose, he could go have a martini afterward. None of this was his fault, but it wasn't equal, either, and for any woman who lives by the mantra that equality is important, this can be a little confusing. It was me who'd alter everything, putting my passions and career dreams on hold, to fulfill this piece of our dream. I found myself in a small moment of reckoning. Did I want it? Yes, I wanted it so much. And with this, I hoisted the needle and sank it into my flesh.</div>

<div class="line_en">About eight weeks later, I heard a sound that erased all traces of resentment: a swishing, watery heartbeat picked up on ultrasound, emanating from the warm cave of my body. We were pregnant. It was for real. Suddenly the responsibility and relative sacrifice meant something completely different, like a landscape taking on new colors, or all the furniture in a house being rearranged so that now everything appeared perfectly in place. I walked around with a secret inside me. This was my privilege, the gift of being female. I felt bright with the promise of what I carried.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大约八周后，我听到一个声音，它消除了我所有的怨恨，那是超声波捕捉到的一个嗖嗖的水样的声音，从我体内那个温暖的洞穴里传出来。我们有孩子了。这次是真的。突然，那些责任和相对的牺牲有了完全不同的意味，就像一片风景着了新颜色，或者房子里所有家具都重新布置了，一切看起来都各得其所。我身体里藏着一个秘密，那是我的特权，是身为女性的礼物。我怀揣着它带来的希望，感觉充满活力。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I would feel this way right through, even as first-trimester fatigue left me drained, as my job stayed busy and Barack continued making his weekly treks to the state capital. We had our outward lives, but now there was something inward happening, a baby growing, a tiny girl. (Because Barack's a fact guy and I'm a planner, finding out her gender was obligatory.) We couldn't see her, but she was there, gaining in size and spirit as fall became winter and then became spring. That thing I'd felt -- my envy for Barack's separateness from the process -- had now utterly reversed itself. He was on the outside, while I got to live the process. I was the process, indivisible from this small, burgeoning life that was now throwing elbows and poking my bladder with her heel. I was never alone, never lonely. She was there, always, while I was driving to work, or chopping vegetables for a salad, or lying in bed at night, poring over the pages of What to Expect When You're Expecting for the nine hundredth time.</div>

<div class="line_en">Though really we'd had no control over anything, somehow in the end it felt as if we'd timed it all perfectly. Very early in the morning on July 4, 1998, I felt the first twinges of labor. Barack and I checked into the University of Chicago hospital, bringing both Maya -- who'd flown in from Hawaii to be there the week I was due -- and my mom for support. It was still hours before the barbecue coals would start to blaze across the city and people would spread their blankets on the grass along the lakeshore, waving flags and waiting for the spectacle of the city fireworks to bloom over the water. We'd miss all of it that year anyway, lost in a whole new blaze and bloom. We were thinking not about country but about family as Malia Ann Obama, one of the two most perfect babies ever to be born to anyone, anywhere, dropped into our world.</div>
