<div class="line_en">The Supervisor did not use those actual words, of course, and the thoughts he really expressed were far more subtle. A human listener would have heard a short burst of rapidly modulated sound, not unlike a high-speed Morse sender in action. Though many samples of Overlord language had been recorded, they all defied analysis because of their extreme complexity. The speed of transmission made it certain that no interpreter, even if he had mastered the elements of the language, could ever keep up with the Overlords in their normal conversation.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Supervisor for Earth stood with his back to Rashaverak, staring out across the multicoloured gulf of the Grand Canyon. Ten kilometres away, yet scarcely veiled by distance, the terraced walls were catching the full force of the sun. Hundreds of metres down the shadowed slope at whose brim Karellen stood, a mule-train was slowly winding its way into the valley's depths. It was strange, Karellen thought, that so many human beings still seized every opportunity for primitive behaviour. They could reach the bottom of the canyon in a fraction of the time, and in far greater comfort, if they chose. Yet they preferred to be jolted along tracks which were probably as unsafe as they looked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡瑞林背对瑞沙维莱克站着，面前是美国著名的大峡谷，炽热的阳光照在峡谷侧壁上，虽然隔着十公里的距离，景象依然十分清晰。卡瑞林站在阴影一侧的悬崖边上，俯视下面。百米深沟里，一头骡子正拉着一车人沿着蜿蜒曲折的小道慢吞吞地往谷底深处驶去。真是不可思议，现在还有这么多人喜欢抓住一切机会重温那些原始经历。他们居然放弃舒适快捷的交通方式到这么一条危险的小道上来颠簸。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Rupert Boyce is a somewhat curious character," Rashaverak answered. "Professionally, he's in charge of animal welfare over an important section of the main African reservation. He's quite efficient, and interested in his work. Because he has to keep watch over several thousand square kilometres, he has one of the fifteen panoramic viewers we've so far issued on loan -- with the usual safeguards, of course. It is, incidentally, the only one with full projection facilities. He was able to make a good case for these, so we let him have them."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“鲁柏特·博伊斯有些怪异，”瑞沙维莱克回答说，“他的工作是照看非洲大保留区中某个片区的动物，他喜欢那份工作，也干得不错。因为他要照看的地区有好几千平方公里，我就从十五台成影仪中选了一台功能最全的给他，当然我们也在随时监视他。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"He wanted to appear to various wild animals so that they could get used to seeing him, and so wouldn't attack when he was physically present. The theory has worked out quite well with animals that rely on sight rather than smell -- though he'll probably get killed eventually. And, of course, there was another reason why we let him have the apparatus."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Precisely. I originally contacted him because he has one of the world's finest libraries of books on parapsychology and allied subjects. He politely but firmly refused to lend any of them, so there was nothing to do but to visit him. I've now read about half his library. It has been a considerable ordeal."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes -- eleven clear cases of partial breakthrough, and twenty-seven probables. The material is so selective, however, that one cannot use it for sampling purposes. And the evidence is hopelessly confused with mysticism -- perhaps the prime aberration of the human mind."</div>

I challenged him on this and he admitted that I was probably right. He would like to find some convincing proof. That is why he Is always carrying out these experiments, even though he pretends that they are only games."</div>

<div class="line_en">"It was chance that brought him there -- his sister has just married Rupert Boyce. He had never met any of the other guests before. I am sure the question was unpremeditated, being inspired by the unusual conditions -- and probably by my presence. Given these factors, it is hardly surprising that he acted in the way he did. His great interest is astronautics: he is secretary of the space-travel group at Cape Town University, and obviously intends to make this field his life study."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他参加那个聚会纯属偶然，他姐姐是鲁柏特的新婚妻子，聚会上他一个人也不认识，可能因为当时的特殊环境，也可能因为我在场，他想到了那个问题。他最大的兴趣是天文学，是开普敦大学太空飞行会的秘书，显然他想终生从事天文研究。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Quite sure. In many ways Boyce is remarkably obtuse and simple-minded. That makes his attempts to do research in this, of all fields, rather pathetic. There is no need to take any special action regarding him."</div>

<div class="line_en">"This is the most exciting feature of the entire affair. Jean Morrel was, almost certainly, the channel through which the information came. But she is twenty-six -- far too old to be a prime contact herself, judging by all our previous experience. It must, therefore, be someone closely linked to her. The conclusion is obvious. We cannot have many more years to wait. We must transfer her to Category Purple: she may be the most important human being alive."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“最让人兴奋的就是这点。信息是简·莫瑞尔传送来的，但她已经二十六岁了，根据我们以往的经验来看，她的年龄太大，因此她本人不可能是主要的信息媒介，应该是某个和她关系密切的人。结论不言而喻，我们不需要再等很多年了。我们必须把她归入紫色类，她是现在世界上最重要的人。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"He will undoubtedly make some checks as soon as he can. But there is no way in which he can prove the accuracy of his information, and because of its peculiar origin he is hardly likely to publish it. Even if he does, will it affect matters in the slightest?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"So it would seem," said Karellen. "But let us not be too certain. Human beings are remarkably ingenious, and often very persistent. It is never safe to underrate them, and it will be interesting to follow Mr. Rodricks' career. I must think about this further."</div>

<div class="line_en">Rupert Boyce never really got to the bottom of it. When his guests had departed, rather less boisterously than usual, he had thoughtfully rolled the table back into its corner. The mild alcoholic fog prevented any profound analysis of what had happened, and even the actual facts were already slightly blurred. He had a vague idea that something of great but elusive importance had happened, and wondered if he should discuss it with Rashaverak. On second thought, he decided it aught be tactless. After all, his brother-in-law had caused the trouble, and Rupert felt vaguely annoyed with young Jan. But was it Jan's fault? Was it anybody's fault? Rather guiltily, Rupert remembered that it had been his experiment. He decided, fairly successfully, to forget the whole business.</div>

<div class="line_en">The person most immediately affected had been George Greggson. He could never forget his feeling of terror as Jean pitched into his arms. Her sudden helplessness transformed her in that moment from an amusing companion to an object of tenderness and affection. Women had fainted -- not always without forethought -- since time immemorial, and men had invariably responded in the desired way. Jean's collapse was completely spontaneous, but it could not have been better planned. In that instant, as he realized later, George came to one of the most important decisions of his life. Jean was definitely the girl who mattered, despite her queer ideas and queerer friends. He had no intention of totally abandoning Naomi or Joy or Elsa or -- what was her name? -- Denise; but the time had come for something more permanent. He had no doubt that Jean would agree with him, for her feelings had been quite obvious from the start. Behind his decision there was another factor of which, he was unaware. Tonight's experience had weakened his contempt and skepticism for Jean's peculiar interests. He would never recognize the fact, but it was so -- and it had removed the last barrier between them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="整个事件对乔治影响最大，他无法忘记简昏倒在怀中时自己的那份担心，一个有趣的伙伴突然变得孤立无助了，越发显得温柔，惹人怜爱。女人自古就有昏倒这样的事，但通常都是装出来的，期待男人们能有某种适当的反应。简的昏倒来得太突然，根本不可能是故意的。乔治后来才意识到，就在那一刻，自己做了人生中最重要的决定。简是自己生活中一个重要的女孩，虽然她想法古怪、朋友怪异，但自己也并不打算完全放弃罗米、乔伊、艾莉莎…她叫什么名字来着，对了，丹妮丝。自己只是该寻求一种更持久的关系了，简肯定会同意自己的决定，从一开始，她的意思就很明显。还有一件事是他自己没有意识到的。经过了今晚的实验，他对简的轻视和怀疑减弱了。他当然永远也不可能知道事情的真相，但情况就是如此，他们间的最后一道障碍消除了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Perhaps he might have done something if the last page of Ruth's notebook could have been found, but it had vanished in the confusion.

The vacancies had been there, and it seemed a pity to waste the opportunity, as he had not visited London since his childhood. He knew that very few of the dozens of papers to be delivered to the I.

<div class="line_en">London had changed enormously in the last fifty years. It now contained scarcely two million people, and a hundred times as many machines. It was no longer a great port, for with every country producing almost all its needs, the entire pattern of world trade had been altered. There were some goods that certain countries still made best, but they went directly by air to their destinations. The trade routes that had once converged on the great harbours, and later on the great airports, had finally dispersed into an intricate web-work covering the whole world with no major nodal points.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="伦敦在过去的五十年里有了很大变化。虽然还有近两百万人口，但它已经不再是个大港口了。每个国家都能生产自己需要的一切，虽然有些国家仍有自己的特产，但这些货物都可以直接空运到目的地，因此，港口、机场等重要交通枢纽都陆续失去了它们原有的作用。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Yet some things had not altered. The city was still a centre of administration, of art, of learning. In these matters, none of the continental capitals could rival it -- not even Paris, despite many claims to the contrary. A Londoner from a century before could still have found his way around, at least at the city's centre, with no difficulty. There were new bridges over the Thames, but in the old places. The great, grimy railway stations had gone -- banished to the suburbs. But the Houses of Parliament were unchanged; Nelson's solitary eye still stared down Whitehall; the dome of St. Paul's still stood above Ludgate Hill, though now there were taller buildings to challenge its preeminence. And the guard still marched in front of Buckingham Palace.</div>

Bloomsbury also had not changed its character in the last century: it was still an island of hotels and boarding-houses, though they no longer jostled each other so closely, or formed such endless, identical rows of soot-coated brick.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所有这一切都可以等到晚些时候再去观赏。现在正值学校放假，他和那两位同学住在大学宿舍里，布卢姆斯伯里区在过去一百年里也没有改变自己的特色，仍是宾馆、住宿楼集中的地区，只是现在那些清一色糊着煤灰的房屋不再乱糟糟地挤作一团，也不再密密麻麻地连成一排又一排。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was not until the second day of the Congress that Jan got his opportunity. The main papers were being read in the great assembly chamber of the Science Centre, not far from the Concert Hall that had done so much to make London the musical metropolis of the world. Jan wanted to hear the first of the day's lectures, which, it was rumoured, would completely demolish the current theory of the formation of the planets.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="会议的第二天，扬才有了机会。伦敦之所以成为世界的音乐之都，那个举世闻名的音乐厅功不可没。就在音乐厅旁边科学中心的一间大会议厅里，几篇重要论文将要宣读。扬想听听第一篇，据说该论文彻底推翻了现行的行星构成理论。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Some humorous civil servant had put the Royal Astronomical Society on the top floor of the great building, a gesture which the Council members fully appreciated as it gave them a magnificent view across the Thames and over the entire northern part of the city. There seemed to be nobody around, but Jan -- clutching his membership card like a passport in case he was challenged -- had no difficulty in locating the library.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不知当初是谁把皇家天文学会安排在顶楼上，那里可以一览泰晤士河和整个北部城区的风景。周围好像没有人，扬还是紧紧握住自己的会员证，以防被查问，他从大楼的分布图上轻松地找到了图书馆的位置。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Perhaps it did, but Jan was little the wiser when he left after the interval. He hurried down to the directory, and looked up the rooms he wanted.</div>

<div class="line_en">He put the catalogue back among its fellows, and for a long time sat quite still, staring sightlessly at the wall of volumes before him. Then he slowly walked out into the still corridors, past the secretary's office (there was somebody there now, busily unpacking parcels of books) and down the stairs. He avoided the elevator, for he wanted to be free and unconfined. There was another lecture he had intended to hear, but that was no longer important now.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="扬把目录放回原处，静静地坐了好一会儿。他望着一架架堆得像墙一样高的目录，思考着，随后他走出图书馆，来到静悄悄的走廊上。走过图书馆办公室时，他看见里面的人正忙碌着拆开一包包的书。扬不想乘电梯，便步行下楼，此时他只想摆脱一切约束。本来还有一篇论文要听，现在也不想去了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It took him almost an hour to find what he wanted, and to learn how to handle the great star catalogues with their millions of entries. He was trembling slightly as he neared the end of his quest, and felt glad that there was no one around to see his nervousness.</div>

<div class="line_en">His thoughts were still in turmoil as he crossed to the embankment wall and let his eye follow the Thames on its unhurried way to the sea. It was hard for anyone with his training in orthodox science to accept the evidence that had now come into his hands. He would never be certain of its truth, yet the probability was overwhelming. As he paced slowly beside the river wall, he marshaled the facts one by one.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="扬走上泰晤士河的河堤，望着缓缓流淌的河水，他的思绪一片混乱。任何一个和他一样受过正规教育的人都不会相信这种方式得来的证据，自己也不敢断定它的真实性，只觉得可能性很大。漫步在河堤上，扬一一整理着自己的思路。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Fact two: "NGS 549672" probably meant nothing to anyone except an astronomer. Though the great National Geographic Survey had been completed half a century before, its existence was known only to a few thousand specialists. And taking any number from it at random, no one could have said where that particular star lay in the heavens.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="证据二：NGS549672对不懂天文学的人来说没有任何意义。尽管半个世纪前完成的国家地理调查中有过相关记录，但知道这项调查的不过几千名这方面的专家。如果从中任选一个编码，根本没有人能说出相应的星球在太空中的具体位置。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Fact one: no one at Rupert's party could possibly have known that he was going to ask that question. He had not known it himself: it had been a spontaneous reaction to the circumstances. Therefore, no one could have prepared any answer, or had it already lying in their minds.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="证据一：鲁柏特的聚会上不可能有人知道自己会问这个问题，自己也是看到瑞沙维莱克才突然想到的，因此就不可能有人预先知道答案，再说，这个答案也不可能存在于人们的意识中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But -- and this was Fact three, which he had only this moment discovered -- the small and insignificant star known as NGS 549672 was in precisely the right place. It lay in the heart of the constellation Carina, at the end of that shining trail Jan himseLf had seen, so few nights ago, leading from the Solar System out across the depths of space.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但，应该是证据三了，就是自己的最新发现。编号为 NGS549672的这样一个微不足道的小星球的位置应该是正确的，处在船底星座的中心，正是自己几天前看见的那道光影所指的方向。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was an impossible coincidence. NGS 549672 must be the home of the Overlords. Yet to accept the fact violated all Jan's cherished ideas of scientific method. Very well -- let them be violated. He must accept the fact that, somehow, Rupert's fantastic experiment had tapped a hitherto unknown source of knowledge.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不可思议的巧合！NGS549572肯定是外星人的星球。但接受这样一个事实就违背了自己着重的一切科学方法，好了，就违背吧，至少有一点可以肯定，鲁柏特的实验中出现了一个无人知晓的信息渠道。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Rashaverak? That seemed the most probable explanation. The Overlord had not been in the circle, but that was a minor point. However, Jan was not concerned with the mechanism of paraphysics: he was only interested in using the results.</div>

<div class="line_en">A slow smile spread over Jan's face as he turned away from the Thames, back towards the gleaming white facade of the Science Centre. Knowledge was power -- and he was the only man on Earth who knew the origin of the Overlords. How he would use that knowledge he could not guess. It would lie safely in his mind, awaiting the moment of destiny.</div>

<div class="line_en">Very little was know about NGS 549672: there had been nothing to distinguish it from a million other stars. But the catalogue gave its magnitude, its co-ordinates, and its spectral type. Jan would have to do a little research, and make a few simple calculations: then he would know, at least approximately, how far the world of the Overlords was from Earth.</div>
