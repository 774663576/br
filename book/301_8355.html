<div class="line_en">At sunrise, they saw with astonishment what a large crowd of believers and curious people had spent the night here. On all paths of the marvellous grove, monks walked in yellow robes, under the trees they sat here and there, in deep contemplation-or in a conversation about spiritual matters, the shady gardens looked like a city, full of people, bustling like bees. The majority of the monks went out with their alms-dish, to collect food in town for their lunch, the only meal of the day. The Buddha himself, the enlightened one, was also in the habit of taking this walk to beg in the morning.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Buddha went on his way, modestly and deep in his thoughts, his calm face was neither happy nor sad, it seemed to smile quietly and inwardly. With a hidden smile, quiet, calm, somewhat resembling a healthy child, the Buddha walked, wore the robe and placed his feet just as all of his monks did, according to a precise rule. But his face and his walk, his quietly lowered glance, his quietly dangling hand and even every finger of his quietly dangling hand expressed peace, expressed perfection, did not search, did not imitate, breathed softly in an unwhithering calm, in an unwhithering light, an untouchable peace.</div>

But attentively he looked at Gotama's head, his shoulders, his feet, his quietly dangling hand, and it seemed to him as if every joint of every finger of this hand was of these teachings, spoke of, breathed of, exhaled the fragrant of, glistened of truth. This man, this Buddha was truthful down to the gesture of his last finger. This man was holy.

<div class="line_en">But in the evening, when the heat cooled down and everyone in the camp started to bustle about and gathered around, they heard the Buddha teaching. They heard his voice, and it was also perfected, was of perfect calmness, was full of peace. Gotama taught the teachings of suffering, of the origin of suffering, of the way to relieve suffering. Calmly and clearly his quiet speech flowed on. Suffering was life, full of suffering was the world, but salvation from suffering had been found: salvation was obtained by him who would walk the path of the Buddha. With a soft, yet firm voice the exalted one spoke, taught the four main doctrines, taught the eightfold path, patiently he went the usual path of the teachings, of the examples, of the repetitions, brightly and quietly his voice hovered over the listeners, like a light, like a starry sky.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="晚上，当炎热已经消退时，林苑里到处都活跃起来，大家聚集到一起听活佛讲经。他们听着活佛的声音，那声音十分完美，显示出完美的平静，充满着和平。戈塔马讲有关烦恼的学问，讲烦恼的起源，讲消除烦恼的途径。他的深沉的演讲平和流畅，清晰明朗。生活就是烦恼，世界充满了烦恼，但是可以找到摆脱烦恼的方法：谁走活佛的路，谁就能得到解脱。">查看中文翻译</div>

Never before, this has been seen so clearly; never before, this has been presented so irrefutably; truly, the heart of every Brahman has to beat stronger with love, once he has seen the world through your teachingsperfectly connected, without gaps, clear as a crystal, not depending on chance, not depending on gods. Whether it may be good or bad, whether living according to it would besuffering or joy, I do not wish to discuss, possibly this is not essential-but the uniformity of the world, that everything which happens is connected, that the great and thesmall things are all encompassed by the same forces of time, by the same law of causes, of coming into being and of dying, this is what shines brightly out of your exaltedteachings, oh perfected one. But according to your very own teachings, this unity and necessary sequence of all things is nevertheless broken in one place, through a small gap, this world of unity is invaded by something alien, something new, something which had not been there before, and which cannot be demonstrated and cannot be proven: these areyour teachings of overcoming the world, of salvation. But with this small gap, with this small breach, the entire eternal and uniform law of the world is breaking apart againand becomes void. Please forgive me for expressing this objection."</div>

I have not doubted for a single moment that you areBuddha, that you have reached the goal, the highest goal towards which so many thousands of Brahmans and sons of Brahmans are on their way. You have found salvation from death. It has come to you in the course of your own search, on your own path, through thoughts, through meditation, through realizations, through enlightenment. It has not come to youby means of teachings! And-thus is my thought, oh exalted one, -- nobody will obtain salvation by means of teachings! You will not be able to convey and say to anybody, ohvenerable one, in words and through teachings what has happened to you in the hour of enlightenment! The teachings of the enlightened Buddha contain much, it teaches many tolive righteously, to avoid evil. But there is one thing which these so clear, these so venerable teachings do not contain: they do not contain the mystery of what the exaltedone has experienced for himself, he alone among hundreds of thousands. This is what I have thought and realized, when I have heard the teachings. This is why I am continuing mytravels-not to seek other, better teachings, for I know there are none, but to depart from all teachings and all teachers and to reach my goal by myself or to die. But often, I'll think of this day, oh exalted one, and of this hour, when my eyes beheld a holy man."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“噢，活佛，但愿你别生我的气。”年轻人说，“我刚才那么，不是要跟你争论，进行无谓的言词之争。你讲的确实有道理，问题并不在于有各种各样的意见。不过，请让我再说明这一点：我从来就没怀疑过你。我没有怀疑过你是活佛，你达到了目的，那个成千上万婆罗让和婆罗门子弟正在追求的最高目的。你已经摆脱了死亡。这是由于你自己的探索，按照你自己的途径，通过思索，通过潜修，通过认识，通过领悟，然后才获得的，而不是通过讲经达到的！哦，活佛，这就是我的想法——没有谁能通过讲经获得解脱！哦，尊敬的活佛，你无法用话语和讲经来告诉别人，在你大彻大悟的时候发生了什么！大彻大悟的活佛的教诲包含着许多内容，它教会人们正直地生活，不去做坏事。但是，有一点却没有包含在如此清楚、如此可敬的讲经之中：它没有包含活佛本人亲身经历的秘密，在千千万万人当中他一个人经历的秘密。这就是我在听你讲经时想到和认识一牟。这就是我要继续去漫游的原因 倒不是为了去寻求另一种更好的学说，因为我知道并没有那样的学说，而是为了抛开一种学说和老师，独自去实现我的目标，或是死去。但我会常常想到这一天，活佛，想到这一时刻，因为我亲眼见到了一位圣贤。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Quietly, Gotama had listened to him, unmoved. Now he spoke, the perfected one, with his kind, with his polite and clear voice: "You've heard the teachings, oh son of a Brahman, and good for you that you've thought about it thus deeply. You've found a gap in it, an error. You should think about this further. But be warned, oh seeker of knowledge, of thethicket of opinions and of arguing about words. There is nothing to opinions, they may be beautiful or ugly, smart or foolish, everyone can support them or discard them. But theteachings, you've heard from me, are no opinion, and their goal is not to explain the world to those who seek knowledge. They have a different goal; their goal is salvation fromsuffering. This is what Gotama teaches, nothing else."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="戈塔马静静地听他说，一动不动，然后，活佛用他那仁慈、礼貌而又清晰的声音说道：“哦，婆罗门之子，难得你听了我讲经之后作出这么深入的思考。你从中发现了一道裂缝，一个缺陷。但愿你能对此继续思考。可是，好学的人，你要警惕众说纷纭和无谓的争论。问题并不在于有各种各样的意见，它们可以是美的或丑的，可是聪明的或愚蠢的，每个人都可以拥护或抵制它们。你从我这儿听到的道理并不是我的意见，其目的也不是给好学的人解释这个世界。它的目的是另外的东西，是为了摆脱痛苦。这就是戈塔马所讲的内容，岂有它哉！”">查看中文翻译</div>

But tell me: Have you seen the multitude of my Samanas, mymany brothers, who have taken refuge in the teachings? And do you believe, oh stranger, oh Samana, do you believe that it would be better for them all the abandon the teachingsand to return into the life the world and of desires?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"Far is such a thought from my mind," exclaimed Siddhartha. "I wish that they shall all stay with the teachings, that they shall reach their goal! It is not my place to judgeanother person's life. Only for myself, for myself alone, I must decide, I must chose, I must refuse. Salvation from the self is what we Samanas search for, oh exalted one. If Imerely were one of your disciples, oh venerable one, I'd fear that it might happen to me that only seemingly, only deceptively my self would be calm and be redeemed, but that intruth it would live on and grow, for then I had replaced my self with the teachings, my duty to follow you, my love for you, and the community of the monks!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这样一种想法离我太远了！”席特哈尔塔叫道，“但愿他们全都信奉你的学说，但愿他们都达到自己的目标！我可没有权利对别人的生活作出评判！我仅仅需要对我，对我自己一个人作出判断。我必须选择，我必须取舍。我们沙门寻求自我解脱，活佛。假如我是你的一名弟子，可敬的活佛，那么，我会担心发生这样的情况：我的自我只是表面上虚假地得到安宁的解脱，实际上它却继续存在并且变大，因为那样我就会有学说，有追随者，有我对你的爱，使僧侣集体成为我的自我！”">查看中文翻译</div>
