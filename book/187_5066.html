<div class="line_en">"Ware danger, King," said Jewel. Tirian looked up and saw that Calormenes (mixed with a few Talking Beasts) were beginning to run towards them from every direction. The two dead men had died without a cry and so it had taken a moment before the rest of the crowd knew what had happened. But now they did. Most of them had naked scimitars in their hands.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“阿斯兰并不是一头驯服的狮子，”蒂莲说道，“我们怎么会知道阿斯兰会干什么呢？我们，是杀人犯啊。珍宝，我决意要回到那儿去。我要交出我的剑，把我自己也交到那些卡乐门人手里，并且要求他们把我带到阿斯兰面前。让阿斯兰公平地审判我。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As soon as they came to the place where the work was going on the Calormenes raised a cry and came towards them with their weapons in hand. But the King held out his sword with the hilt towards them and said:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们刚来到正在伐木运木的地方，卡乐门人便发出一声呐喊，手中拿着武器向他们跑来了。但国王伸出来的剑却是剑柄向着他们的，他说道：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then the dark men came round them in a thick crowd, smelling of garlic and onions, their white eyes flashing dreadfully in their brown faces. They put a rope halter round Jewel's neck. They took the King's sword away and tied his hands behind his back. One of the Calormenes, who had a helmet instead of a turban and seemed to be in command, snatched the gold circlet off Tirian's head and hastily put it away somewhere among his clothes. They led the two prisoners uphill to a place where there was a big clearing. And this was what the prisoners saw. At the centre of the clearing, which was also the highest point of the hill, there was a little hut like a stable, with a thatched roof. Its door was shut. On the grass in front of the door there sat an Ape. Tirian and Jewel, who had been expecting to see Aslan and had heard nothing about an Ape yet, were very bewildered when they saw it. The Ape was of course Shift himself, but he looked ten times uglier than when he lived by Caldron Pool, for he was now dress- ed up. He was wearing a scarlet jacket which did not fit him very well, having been made for a dwarf. He had Jewelled slippers on his hind paws which would not stay on properly because, as you know, the hind paws of an Ape are really like hands. He wore what seemed to be a paper crown on his head. There was a great pile of nuts beside him and he kept cracking nuts with his jaws and spitting out the shells. And he also kept on pulling up the scarlet jacket to scratch himself. A great number of Talking Beasts stood facing him, and nearly every face in that crowd looked miserably worried and bewildered. When they saw who the prisoners were they all groaned and whimpered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是黑皮肤的人们向他们围拢来，成了密集的一群，发出大蒜和洋葱的气昧，白色眼睛在褐色脸上可怕地闪烁着。他们在珍宝的脖子上套了个用绳子做的笼头。他们拿掉了国王的剑，把他的双手反缚在背后。其中有个卡乐门人，他不戴缠头巾而戴头盔，仿佛是个发号施令的人，他从蒂莲的头上抢走了一个金箍，急急忙忙塞在他衣服里边的什么地方。他们把这两个羁押犯带上山去，带到有一大块林中空地的地方。这便是羁押犯所见到的清晰。空地的中央，也就是小山的最高处，有一间像马厩似的、茅草屋顶的小屋。屋子的门关着。门前草地上坐着一头无尾猿。蒂莲和珍宝原是指望看到阿斯兰的，却还没听说过有头无尾猿，他们看见那猿猴时心中就十分诧异惶惑了。无尾猿当然就是诡谲，但是，看起来，它比它住在大锅渊旁时丑陋十倍，因为它现在打扮起来了。它正穿一件猩红色茄克衫，原是给小矮人缝制的，所以它穿起来并不十分合身。它的后爪子穿了镶嵌珠宝的拖鞋，拖鞋不合脚，也穿不牢，因为，你知道，无尾猿的后爪，确实像人的手。它头上戴一顶仿佛是纸王冠的帽子。它身边有一大堆坚果，它不断地用上下顿喀啦喀啦咬着坚果，把果壳吐出口来。它也不断拉起猩红色茄克衫给自己搔痒。一群说人话的野兽面对着无尾猿站在那儿，在这一群中，几乎每张脸看上去都是悲惨的焦虑而又惶惑。它们看到谁是羁押犯时，大家都呻吟呜咽了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"We'll see about those two later," said the Ape, spitting out a shell in the direction of the two prisoners. "I got some other business first. They can wait. Now listen to me, everyone. The first thing I want to say is about nuts. Where's that Head Squirrel got to?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这两个人以后再处理。”无尾猿说道，朝着两个囚犯把果壳吐了过去，“我先要办别的事。他们不妨等着。现在，大家听我说。我首先要说的是关于坚果的事。松鼠的头目在那儿啊。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"O Lord Shift, mouthpiece of Aslan," said the chief Calormene. "We bring you prisoners. By our skill and courage and by the permission of the great god Tash we have taken alive these two desperate murderers."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“阿斯兰的代言人，诡谲阁下，”卡乐门人的头目说道，“我们送羁押犯来了，凭我们的技巧和勇敢，倚仗伟大的塔什神的允诺，我们把这两个亡命的杀人犯活捉了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh you are, are you?" said the Ape with a nasty look. "Now attend to me. I want -- I mean, Aslan wants -- some more nuts. These you've brought aren't anything like enough. You must bring some more, do you hear? Twice as many. And they've got to be here by sunset tomorrow, and there mustn't be any bad ones or any small ones among them."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“啊，你是，是你吗？”无尾猿说道，神情令人作呕，“现在注意听我的吩咐。我要——载的意思是阿斯兰要——阿斯兰还要些坚果。你们已经送来的那些坚果是十分不够的。数量要翻一番。明天太阳落山时必须送到这儿。其中不许有一颗坏的或一颗小的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Give me that man's sword," said the Ape. So they took the King's sword and handed it, with the sword-belt and all, to the monkey. And he hung it round his own neck: and it made him look sillier than ever.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“把这人的剑给我。”无尾猿说道。所以他们就取了国王的剑，连同剑带一起递给猿猴。无尾猿把剑和剑带挂在它的颈子上，显得十分愚蠢无知。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="其他的松鼠连声发出一阵惊惶的咕咕哝哝的声音，松鼠头儿鼓起勇气说道：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The poor squirrels all scampered away as if a dog were after them. This new order was terrible news for them. The nuts they had carefully hoarded for the winter had nearly all been eaten by now; and of the few that were left they had already given the Ape far more than they could spare.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可怜的松鼠便统统惊惶地跑开了，仿佛有一条狗儿在追它们似的。这个新的命令对它们是个可怕的讯息。它们小心翼翼地藏起来过冬的坚果，如今差不多都被吃掉了，从留下来的那么一点儿里边，它们已经拿出来交给无尾猿的数量，也远远超过了它们所能节省下来的了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then a deep voice -- it belonged to a great tusked and shaggy Boar -- spoke from another part of the crowd. "But why can't we see Aslan properly and talk to him?" it said. "When he used to appear in Narnia in the old days everyone could talk to him face to face."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后是一个深沉的声音——属于浑身粗毛、长着撩牙的巨大野猪的声音——从另一部分群众中发出来了。“为什么我们不能堂堂正正地见到阿斯兰，同阿斯兰说话呢？”它说，“在以往的日子里，阿斯兰经常在纳尼亚出现，大家都可以面对面地同他谈话。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well you won't," said the Ape. "He may be very kind (though it's a lot more than most of you deserve) and come out for a few minutes tonight. Then you can all have a look at him. But he will not have you all crowding round him and pestering him with questions. Anything you want to say to him will be passed on through me: if I think it's worth bothering him about. In the meantime all you squirrels had better go and see about the nuts. And make sure they are here by tomorrow evening or, my word! you'll catch it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你们不行，”无尾猿说道，“也许狮王十分仁慈（尽管你们大多数不配消受），今儿个夜里会出来几分钟。那时你们大家可以看上一眼。但狮王可不愿让你们大家挤在他的周围，用各种问题跟他纠缠不清。你们要说给狮王听的不论什么话，都得通过我向狮王汇报，如果我觉得那事情是值得麻烦狮王的话。同时，你们所有的松鼠们，最好还是去张罗坚果吧。要保证明儿晚上把坚果送到这儿，不然的话，你们就会吃苦头的。告诉你们，我可说一是，说二是二的！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"And now there's another thing you got to learn," said the Ape. "I hear some of you are saying I'm an Ape. Well, I'm not. I'm a Man. If I look like an Ape, that's because I'm so very old: hundreds and hundreds of years old. And it's because I'm so old that I'm so wise. And it's because I'm so wise that I'm the only one Aslan is ever going to speak to. He can't be bothered talking to a lot of stupid animals. He'll tell me what you've got to do, and I'll tell the rest of you. And take my advice, and see you do it in double quick time, for he doesn't mean to stand any nonsense."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“如今你们还有另一件事应该好好认识的，”无尾猿说道，“我听说你们有些人说我是无尾猿。告诉你们吧，我不是猿，我是人。如果我看上去像只猿猴，那是因为我老而又老了，我已经几百岁几千岁了。而且，就因为我年纪那么大，所以我那么聪明。就因为我是那么聪明，所以阿斯兰一直是只跟我一个人说话。阿斯兰不耐烦跟许多愚蠢的动物谈话。他会把你们必须照办的事告诉我，我就告诉你们其余的人。接受我的忠告吧，你们要留神用加倍的速度办好事情，因为狮王是无意忍受胡言乱语的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A low moaning and whimpering was heard among the Beasts; and, after that, a dead silence which was more miserable still.</div>

Well, you can get that idea out of your heads at once. And not only the Horses either. Everybody who can work is going to be made to work in future. Aslan has it all settled with the King of Calormen -- The Tisroc, as our dark faced friends the Calormenes call him. All you Horses and Bulls and Donkeys are to be sent down into Calormen to work for your living -- pulling and carrying the way horses and such-like do in other countries. And all you digging animals like Moles and Rabbits and Dwarfs are going down to work in The Tisroc's mines. And --"</div>

That is to say, your pay will be paid into Aslan's treasury and he will use it all for everybody's good." Then he glanced, and almost winked, at the chief Calormene. The Calormene bowed and replied, in the pompous Calormene way:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“别来这一套|不许吵吵闹闹的！”无尾猿咆哮着说道，“谁说过要去做奴隶的？你们不会成为奴隶的。你们会得到报酬——还是很好的工资哩。那就是说，你们的工资，都将收归阿斯兰的国库，阿斯兰将把钱都用在为大家谋福利上。”无尾猿这就瞧瞧那卡乐门人的头儿，几乎跟他眨巴着眼睛。那个卡乐门人鞠躬回答，都是卡乐门式的浮夸风度。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Baby!" he hissed. "Silly little bleater! Go home to your mother and drink milk. What do you understand of such things? But the others, listen. Tash is only another name for Aslan. All that old idea of us being right and the Calormenes wrong is silly. We know better now. The Calormenes use different words but we all mean the same thing. Tash and Aslan are only two different names for you know Who. That's why there can never be any quarrel between them. Get that into your heads, you stupid brutes. Tash is Aslan: Aslan is Tash."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“娃娃！”无尾猿嘶嘶地骂道，“愚蠢的小羊崽子！回家到你娘身边去吃奶吧。这种事情你懂个啥？可是你们其他的野兽听着塔什不过是阿斯兰的另一个名字。一切老的观念，说什么我们是正确的、卡乐门人是错误的，全是蠢话。现在我们比较明白了。卡乐门人用的词儿不同，然而我们指的都是一个意思。塔什和阿斯兰不过是两个不同的名字，指的是谁，你们都知道。所以他们之间从来没有什么争吵。你们这些愚蠢的野兽，要牢牢记住这一点：塔什就是阿斯兰，阿斯兰就是塔什。”">查看中文翻译</div>

They say he has four arms and the head of a vulture. They kill Men on his altar. I don't believe there's any such person as Tash. But if there was, how could Aslan be friends with him?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“对不起，”小羊说，“我搞不懂。我们跟卡乐门人有什么相干？我们属于阿斯兰。他们属于塔什。他们有个神，叫做塔什。据说，塔什神有四条胳膊，一个鹰头。他们在塔什神的祭台上杀人。我不相信竟有像塔什那样的人物。然而，如果有的话，阿斯兰怎么能和他做朋友？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">You know how sad your own dog's face can look sometimes. Think of that and then think of all the faces of those Talking Beasts -- all those honest, humble, bewildered Birds, Bears, Badgers, Rabbits, Moles, and Mice -- all far sadder than that. Every tail was down, every whisker drooped. It would have broken your heart with very pity to see their faces. There was only one who did not look at all unhappy.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a ginger Cat -- a great big Tom in the prime of life -- who sat bolt upright with his tail curled round his toes, in the very front row of all the Beasts.

<div class="line_en">He meant to go on and ask how the terrible god Tash who fed on the blood of his people could possibly be the same as the good Lion by whose blood all Narnia was saved. If he had been allowed to speak, the rule of the Ape might have ended that day; the Beasts might have seen the truth and thrown the Ape down. But before he could say another word two Calormenes struck him in the mouth with all their force, and a third, from behind, kicked his feet from under him. And as he fell, the Ape squealed in rage and terror.</div>
