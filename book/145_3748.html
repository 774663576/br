<div class="line_en">But China was a hard habit to break, and I had signed a contract for this book, one that I had wanted to write for a very long time. 'Another month,' I told myself, 'and then you can say goodbye.' So I packed my bags, dragged myself to the airport, and flew to Shanghai, where my kind friend Gwen had offered me a room of my own, in her lovely flat in the French Concession. There, in businesslike fashion, I set about exploring the food traditions of eastern China.</div>

<div class="line_en">In January 2007, I went back to China again for more than a month. My heart was not in it. I did wonder if I had reached the end of the road. Would it not be more honest, I asked myself, to admit that the gluttonous China phase of my life was over? It had been an incredible journey, for sure, and one that I wouldn't have missed for anything. But the joy of it had faded. Years before, I had abandoned one career based on other people's expectations of me, and it had been a liberation. Perhaps it was time to do the same thing again. Often, people were asking me, 'Which Chinese regional cuisine are you going to do next, Fuchsia?', assuming that I was planning to write a book about each province in turn. 'Are you crazy?' I wanted to reply. 'Do you know how many provinces there are? Do you know what Hunan did to me?'</div>

<div class="line_en">Shanghai itself has become the darling of food journalists, who flock there to scoff 'soup dumplings' at the Nanxiang restaurant in the Yu Garden, and to dine at the celebrated Jean Georges on the Bund. But, by Chinese standards, Shanghai lacks history: it's a modern metropolis, owing its ascendancy to the foreign concessions built there in the mid-nineteenth century, and richer in 'fusion cuisine' than real culinary tradition. My researches were to take me to the more ancient centres of gastronomy, in the hinterlands of Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="上海本身就是美食记者的“宠儿”。他们成群结队地跑到豫园的南翔馒头店吃小笼包，又到外滩著名的Jean Georges吃法餐。不过，以中国的标准，上海的历史积淀不深，是一座现代大都市，“世界融合料理”比传统饮食更丰富。而我的研究是要去更为古老的饮食中心，比上海更为内陆的江苏省和浙江省。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">While one might say that northern Beijing is the home of imperial cooking, southern Guangdong of the cuisine of the merchant class, and Sichuan of fiery peasant fare, eastern China is the gastronomic demesne of the cultivated man. It was in Hangzhou that the Song Dynasty poet Su Dongpo encouraged the development of a marvellous stewed pork; and in Nanjing that the gourmet Yuan Mei wrote his famous cookery book. In the twentieth century, the writer Lu Wenfu set his novella The Gourmet, the story of the relationship between a reactionary gourmand and a puritanical communist over decades of revolution, in his hometown of Suzhou.</div>

<div class="line_en">Yangzhou lies in the fertile southern Yangtze region, long recognised as a 'home of fish and rice' on account of the plenty of its produce. Since the Qin Dynasty it has been an administrative centre, although its roots as a settlement are yet more ancient. It came to prominence with the contruction, during the Sui and Tang Dynasties, of the Grand Canal, a waterway linking Hangzhou, even then a famous producer of silk and tea, with the old northern capitals at Luoyang and Xi'an. Yangzhou lay at the crucial intersection of the Grand Canal, running from north to south, and the Yangtze river, which flows from the mountains of Tibet to the eastern coast. As the transport hub of China, Yangzhou became one of its wealthiest cities. For centuries its name was a byword for luxury and sophistication. But after the railways came in the nineteenth century, leaving Yangzhou languishing on a secondary line, it became a relative backwater. These days tourists flock to Suzhou, for its gardens, and Hangzhou, for its pretty West Lake. But Yangzhou is off the beaten track.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="扬州位于土壤肥沃的江南地区，因为物产丰富，素有“鱼米之乡”的美誉。这里从远古时代就有人聚居；从秦朝开始一直是个行政中心；隋唐时期修建了大运河，连接那时候就已经因为丝绸与茶叶闻名的杭州和北边的都城洛阳与长安。扬州是大运河上的重要城市，再加上发源于青藏高原、流向东部沿海的长江也流经这里，使其成为中国的交通枢纽，更是个诗酒繁华地、温柔富贵乡。数百年来，一提起“扬州”，人们想到的就是奢侈高贵的生活、文人雅士的做派。但十九世纪有了铁路，经过扬州的路线并不重要，这里的发展渐渐有些停滞。现在，游客们经常蜂拥到苏州赏园林、到杭州游西湖，扬州却不在必游名单上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The southern Yangtze region, in which these ancient cities lie, produces some of China's finest ingredients, including Jinhua cured ham, Shaoxing rice wine and Zhenjiang vinegar, as well as those famous hairy crabs. Many of its cities are known for speciality dishes: Hangzhou for Beggar's Chicken, Vinegar Fish and Dongpo Pork (named after the poet), Nanjing for its salted duck, and Suzhou for sizzling eel and a soup of leafy water-shield from the Taihu lake. Yet none of these places can compete with the culinary glory of Yangzhou, the ancient gastronomic capital of the east, and the cradle of what they call 'Huaiyang' or 'Weiyang' cuisine (the names have old geographical connotations).</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="长江以南古城遍布的地区，有着中国最上乘精细的食材，比如金华火腿、绍兴酒、镇江醋，当然还有著名的大闸蟹。这里的很多城市都有自己代表性的特色菜：杭州有叫花鸡、西湖醋鱼和东坡肉；南京有盐水鸭；苏州有响油鳝糊和太湖里捞的莼菜做的汤。不过，要说美食，这些地方都比不上扬州，这里曾是古代华东的美食之都，也是“淮扬菜”的摇篮。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For me, it was the last, vital missing piece of a jigsaw. For fifteen years I had roamed all over China, from the deserts of the west to Shanghai's 'Paris of the East', from colonial Hong Kong to the old imperial capital of Xi'an. My travels had been by no means exhaustive -- in China there is always more to explore -- but I had covered a great deal of gastronomic territory. Yet although I had glimpsed Yangzhou's cuisine in its influences on the courtly cooking of Beijing, and on the chic new restaurants of Shanghai, I had never actually been there. For a specialist in Chinese cuisine, this was an unforgivable omission.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于我，这里是拼图上最后的一块，至关重要。十五年来，我漫游中国上下，从西部的沙漠到上海这个“东方巴黎”，从殖民历史深厚的香港到六朝古都西安。当然，也不能说我就是见多识广了，因为中国是永远探索不完的。但在美食版图上，我也算是个走南闯北的行者了。不过，对于扬州美食，我只是在北京的宫廷菜中窥视过其影响，在上海那些时髦别致的新派餐馆中有过肤浅的体验，却从未亲自踏足扬州。我可是中餐专家，不能留下这样的遗憾。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was a cool, sunny morning when I took the main Shanghai-Nanjing railway line as far as the old vinegar town of Zhenjiang, a slow-moving place where, even in the early twenty-first century, foreigners were as remarkable as martians; men in Mao suits carried chirruping crickets in their pockets, and a blacksmith, working on the pavement, hammered woks out of red-hot iron. A taxi carried me to the car-ferry port, where I walked aboard. And then I stood on the top deck as we wove our way across a shifting warp of barges and passenger ships on the Yangtze, whose waters glittered in the bright winter sun. When we reached the northern bank, I hitched a lift for the short hop to Yangzhou.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那是个晴朗而冷冽的早晨，我沿着沪宁铁路（上海到南京）来到了因为出产陈醋而闻名的镇江。小城生活发展迟滞、节奏缓慢，现在已经是二十一世纪初，人们看到外国人仍然像见火星人一样好奇又惊慌。男人们穿着中山装，口袋里装着吱吱喳喳的蛐蛐儿；人行道上有个铁匠，正捶打着烧得通红的铁做炒锅。我招手叫了辆出租，去了镇江的渡口，上了渡轮。站在最高的甲板上，看渡船穿梭于长江上来来去去的驳船与客轮之中，冬日灿烂的阳光在江面上撒下闪烁的碎金。到了北岸，我找了辆车，很快就到了扬州。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As usual, my preparation had been minimal. I had searched in vain for useful books about Yangzhou and its food. I did, however, have the address of the local branch of the Chinese Culinary Association in my notebook, and I knew from past experience that it might be a good place to start. Since it was early and I had little luggage, I simply hailed a bicycle rickshaw.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="和之前一样，我又没做什么功课。当然我找了下关于扬州和淮扬菜的书，却没一本有用的。不过嘛，我笔记本上记了中国烹饪协会扬州分会的地址，从过去的经验看，从这里入手应该没错。天还早，我行李也不多，于是就招了辆人力车。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I wasn't expecting much of the trip. So many times I had arrived in a Chinese city that I didn't know, seduced by legends about its lively street life and architectural beauty, only to find that most of it had been demolished and replaced by monotonous concrete. Suzhou had lost most of its canals and old streets; I could find no old lanes in Hangzhou; and they were pulling Shanghai apart by the day. In my writing, I was determined to find beauty in these places, to bring alive their characters and rich culinary traditions, and yet it seemed increasingly like an exercise in archaeology rather than reportage. That's why Yangzhou was such a delightful surprise. From the moment my driver dropped me off near the city centre, I felt that there was something different about it.</div>

<div class="line_en">I gave the driver the address of the association. 'Please will you take me through the old streets?' I asked, expecting him to tell me that they had been knocked down last year. But he didn't -- he actually drove me through the old streets. They were everything I had longed to see. We rambled over a canal bridge where a few people were selling pheasants, rabbits, and baskets of fruit, and into a long lane bordered by grey-brick courtyard houses, with alleys running off on either side. Old-fashioned cotton banners emblazoned with the Chinese characters for 'rice' and 'wine' hung outside little shops. There were street vendors too: an elderly man making pancakes on a griddle, a butcher mincing pork with a cleaver on a wooden board, someone selling home-made salted mustard greens, dark and sleek. Pig's ears and chunks of carp and chicken hung on the outer walls of houses, salted and spiced, wind-drying.</div>

<div class="line_en">Even the busier streets in the old town had retained some character. They were lined with wutong trees and small shops selling kitchenware, clothes and locally made knives; they were busy with bicycles and unruly mopeds. We passed a mother cycling home with her son, his head resting gently on her back; a baker, standing beside an oven, wiping her hot face with a wet towel. This was no pastiche of local street life recreated for the tourists, but a living city. It reminded me of the vanished old quarters of Chengdu that I had known and adored.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就算是老城里比较繁忙些的街道，也都保持了一定的风格特色。街道两旁种着一队队梧桐树，排列着一家家小店，卖的是厨具、衣服和当地制作的刀；常有自行车和比较不守规矩的“小电驴”穿梭来往。一个骑自行车带儿子回家的妈妈经过我们身边，儿子的头轻轻靠在妈妈背上；一个面包师站在烤箱旁边，拿热腾腾的湿毛巾洗着红光满面的脸。没有为了游客而东拼西凑的“四不像”市井生活，这里本身就是一座活生生的城市。这让我怀念起自己熟悉而喜爱、现在却已经消失无闻的成都老城区。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The three deputy secretaries of the culinary association who were at work that day were immediately welcoming. I found them in a first-floor office piled with papers. They sat amid cupboards crammed with food magazines and books, looking out over low rooftops. The amiable, chain-smoking Mr Qiu made me a cup of tea, and they all gathered round for a chat. Within minutes we discovered that we had mutual friends -- professors of food history in Chengdu. I got along particularly well with the gruff-voiced, talkative Mr Xia, who seemed to know everything about Huaiyang cuisine. When the other two had drifted back to their desks, he and I continued to sip our tea as he taught me about Yangzhou's magnificent past.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天，烹饪协会有三个副秘书长在上班，他们立刻对我表示了热烈欢迎。我走进一楼一间堆满文件的办公室，他们都在。办公室层高不高，里面的柜子都“顶天立地”，也放满了美食杂志和书籍。和蔼可亲、香烟不离手的邱先生给我泡了杯茶，大家都坐过来跟我聊天。聊了几分钟，就发现我们都认识成都的一些研究餐饮历史的教授。我和声音粗哑而健谈的夏先生尤其谈得来，他好像对淮扬菜了如指掌。另外两个秘书长都回到办公桌前了，我还继续喝着茶，听夏先生给我介绍扬州辉煌灿烂的过去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The city was a famous trading port, he said, with direct commercial links to Japan, friendly relations with Persia and many other distant realms. Marco Polo supposedly stayed here in the late thirteenth century, and remarked on the 'large and splendid city… so great and powerful that its authority extends over twenty-seven cities, all large and prosperous and actively engaged in commerce'. Above all, Mr Xia told me, Yangzhou owed its wealth and opulence to the salt trade, which flourished during the Qing. Sea salt, evaporated in salt-ponds on the Shandong and Jiangsu coasts, was transported by water to Yangzhou, the largest wholesale salt market in China. It was such a profitable business that Yangzhou salt taxes came to make up a quarter of China's entire tax revenue.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他说，扬州城曾是著名的贸易港口，直接和日本通商，与波斯以及其他很多遥远的国度都建立了友好关系。十三世纪末，马可·波罗应该在此旅居过，他赞叹扬州是个“辉煌无比的大城市……如此雄伟，如此强大，下辖二十七座广大城池，都十分繁荣，积极通商”。夏先生告诉我，扬州能如此富庶，最重要的原因就是清朝时期逐渐繁荣发展起来的海盐贸易。山东和江苏沿海地区蒸发提纯的海盐，经过水路运往扬州，使这里成为全中国最大的海盐批发市场。做这个生意很赚钱，扬州盐商交的税一度占到了全中国总体税收的四分之一。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">On the back of their lucrative trade, the Yangzhou salt merchants grew rich. They built mansions and pleasure gardens, entertained lavishly, and led lives of great refinement. One of them compiled a collection of recipes that is still in print. Men of letters flocked to the city. During the Tang, the prominent poet Du Fu praised the beauty of its people, the wine-loving Li Bai penned lines inspired by local feasting and carousing, and Wang Jian wrote of the thousand lanterns that gleamed in its nightmarkets. The Song poet Su Dongpo also lived here for a while, taking up lodgings in the Stone Tower Buddhist Temple.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有了这日进斗金的生意，扬州的盐商越来越富。他们修建了阔气的豪宅、修身养性的园林，挥金如土地进行娱乐，过上了十分精致讲究的生活。其中一位编撰了《调鼎集》，清朝中期厨师实践经验集大成的烹饪书，到现在还在印刷出版。文人墨客更是纷纷下扬州。唐朝“诗圣”杜甫赞颂过扬州人的美好善良；“酒仙”李白在这里欢宴畅饮、诗兴大发，写下不少传世名句；王建写了扬州“夜市千灯照碧云”；宋朝诗人苏东坡也在这里住过一段时日，寄宿在石塔寺。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">During the Qing Dynasty, the Kangxi and Qianlong Emperors were unable to resist the charms of Yangzhou. They must already have had a taste for its delicacies, because Huaiyang cooking had long been influential at court. They lingered in Yangzhou during their lengthy 'tours of the south', idling in its gardens, playing at fishing, and being entertained by the salt merchants to sumptuous feasts. The only extant description of the fabled Man-Han imperial banquet of the Qing era is in a chronicle of Yangzhou life and society, 'Record of the painted pleasure-boats of Yangzhou', written by a local playwright, Li Dou, in the eighteenth century: 'They had bird's nest with chicken slivers, abalone with pearl leaves, a thick soup of crab and shark skin, bear's paw with crucian carp tongues…' Li Dou listed more than a hundred dishes made with every fine ingredient, accompanied by fresh fruits and delicate vegetables.</div>

First I tasted the 'four strands of flavour' (si tiao wei): tiny, stimulating dishes to awaken the palate. There were fried peanuts, cubes of fermented beancurd stained pink by red yeast rice, morsels of pickled cabbage and slices of ginger preserved in soy sauce. Afterwards, I moved on to the appetisers proper: savoury salt-water goose, 'vegetarian chicken' made from marinated beancurd skin, tiny 'drunken' river shrimps, crisp-and-supple sweet-sour cucumber, and a marvellous rendition of Zhenjiang yao rou. This was a terrine of shards of pork in aspic served with a dip of aromatic Zhenjiang vinegar. The yao rou, whose name might be translated as 'delectable meat', melted, divinely, in my mouth.</div>

<div class="line_en">'Those last dishes were two of the so-called "three heads" of Yangzhou,' said Mr Xia. 'The third was a whole pig's head. But we thought that might be a bit excessive for today, given that there are only six of us. Perhaps another time we can gather a few more people for a full "three-headed" feast?' (Later, I learned the intriguing fact that the most acclaimed producers of the slow-cooked Yangzhou pig's head were monks at the Fahai Buddhist temple, who were officially, like all other monks, vegetarian. They would only show off this talent for carnivorous cookery to people they knew and trusted -- if a stranger knocked on the door and demanded a pig's head, they would be dismissed with a mischievous smile and a Buddhist greeting: 'A mi tuo fo!')</div>

<div class="line_en">The main courses were just as delicately pleasing. We sampled 'hibiscus-flower fish slices', soft white pillows of fish-flesh blended with egg white and starch, tender as a custard but with a slight crispness to their bite; fresh broad beans with straw mushrooms; and a red-braised carp head with farmhouse beancurd, served on a grand blue-and-white china platter (Mr Xia probed out for me the sweet, fatty flesh around the fish's eye). And then there were the famous 'lion's head meatballs', cooked slowly in individual clay pots until they were so tender they yielded at a chopstick's touch.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="主菜也是一样的美味可口。我们尝了尝芙蓉鱼片，软嫩的鱼肉像小小的白枕头，裹了蛋清与水芡粉，吃起来像奶冻一样柔滑，咬下去却又感到一种脆嫩；还有豆瓣草菇、用巨大的青花瓷盘端上来的红烧江鲢老豆腐（夏先生专门帮我挑了鱼眼睛周围那甜丝丝、滑嫩嫩的肉）。当然少不了著名的清炖狮子头：专门用陶罐文火慢炖，直到肉圆软烂，筷子一沾就完全解体。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I learned from my dining companions that Yangzhou cooks were known across China for the dexterity of their knifework. The lion's head meatball, for example, owed its irresistible succulence to the fact that the meat was hand-chopped into 'fish-eye' grains, and not minced or puréed. 'The cook's cleaver, of course,' said Mr Xia, 'is just one of the "Three Knives" of Yangzhou: the others are scissors, and the pedicurist's blade. "Foot-repairing" is another of this city's great pleasures. You must try it.' (Later, nervously, I entrusted my feet to a pedicurist who shaved bits off them until they were as soft and sweet as a newborn baby's.)</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="听一起吃饭的人说，扬州厨师的刀工敏捷精湛，在全中国都是出名的。比如，狮子头如此美味多汁、令人无法抗拒，就是因为厨子们会把肉手工剁成“鱼眼粒”，而不是单纯地剁肉末或者绞成肉酱。“嗯，厨刀嘛，”夏先生说，“是‘扬州三把刀’中的一把，另外两把是理发刀和修脚刀。修脚也是扬州城的好享受哦，你一定得试试看。”（后来，我很紧张地把自己的双脚交给一位修脚师。他帮我一点点地去了脚上的死皮，然后双脚变得又嫩又滑又香，仿佛初生婴儿的双足。）">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The next dish, Wensi Beancurd, also had Buddhist connections. In a dense broth hung filigree strands of silken beancurd, threaded with a few wisps of Jinhua ham. It was invented, so they say, by a Qing Dynasty monk at the Tianning Temple who was renowned for his beancurd cookery (he made a vegetarian version, seasoned with mushrooms). Earlier, at a beancurd stall in the backstreets, I had seen a man cutting curd for this dish. His sharp knife, slicing up and down, moved almost imperceptibly through the block of beancurd, shaving off slices as thin as silk. These he cut, in turn, transforming the slices into a mass of fine threads. It was masterful.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接下来这道菜叫文思豆腐，也有佛教渊源。浓稠的高汤里有千丝万缕爽滑的豆腐，还混杂着一丝丝金华火腿。听他们说，这道菜的发明者是清朝天宁寺一个以做豆腐菜出名的和尚（他做的是素食版，用蘑菇提味）。之前在小街小巷里的豆腐摊，我也见过一个人在切豆腐，准备做这道菜。他那锋利的刀上下挥舞，几乎是肉眼无法察觉地在那块豆腐之间穿梭游移，切下绸子一样细腻轻薄的豆腐片，然后又切成细细的丝，真称得上是大师手笔了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We sat there, talking in Chinese, of course, discussing the characteristics of Yangzhou cuisine. At one point during the meal, Mr Xia looked at me with sudden concern, and asked: 'I do hope you can take the flavour of Huaiyang dishes, when they are not hot and spicy like your usual Sichuanese food.' I looked back at him in puzzlement, but it was Mr Qiu who reminded him that I was not actually Sichuanese, but from England, so it was unlikely to be a problem. We all laughed, Mr Xia at his mistake, I because this curious exchange made me realise how often I did actually find myself referring to other foreigners as lao wai, and saying things like: 'In Sichuan, we tend to add a bit of chilli-bean paste to our red-braised dishes' or 'In Sichuan, we call it such-and-such' or 'In Sichuan, we drink the soup at the end of the meal'.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们在餐桌上用中文谈笑风生，话题自然离不开淮扬菜的特色。吃着吃着，夏先生突然略带忧虑地望着我说，“希望你吃得惯淮扬菜的味道，因为没有你们川菜那么麻辣。”我满腹狐疑地望着他。不过邱先生出来解了围，提醒他说我不是四川人，是英国人，所以这不是个问题。我们哈哈大笑，夏先生是笑自己犯了个错，我笑的是突然意识到自己经常把别的外国人说成“老外”，还经常说“我们四川经常在红烧菜里面加豆瓣酱”、“我们四川把这个叫什么什么”、“我们四川都是吃完饭再喝汤”。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We finished our dinner, inevitably, with the one dish that the entire outside world recognises as a local speciality -- Yangzhou fried rice. On almost every restaurant menu in Western Chinatowns it appears, and finally I was tasting it in its place of origin. The rice was shot with tiny cubes of dark pink ham and brown shiitake, wisps of golden egg, crabmeat, and tiny shrimp. It was rich but not oily, wok-fragrant and utterly delicious. Afterwards, we rinsed our palates with a broth afloat with mushrooms and cai tai, a seasonal green, and then refreshed ourselves with slices of watermelon and fresh sugarcane from the south.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当然，这顿饭的尾声上的一定是扬州在全世界最知名的一道特色菜：扬州炒饭。这道菜几乎出现在西方所有唐人街餐馆的菜单上，现在我终于能在诞生地吃到正宗的了。米饭里面混了深色火腿和棕色香菇，都切成小块；还有小条小条煎得金黄的鸡蛋、蟹肉和小小的河虾。内容与味道都很丰富，却并不油腻，散发着刚出锅的香气。除了“好吃”二字，也不知道怎么形容了。之后，我们喝了飘着蘑菇和时令菜薹的汤，算是清理了下味蕾；再吃上几片西瓜和南方的甘蔗，更觉清新爽利。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Over the next few days, I explored the landscaped gardens of Yangzhou. The grandest was the Slender West Lake Park, upon which the salt merchants had lavished their funds to make it fit for the Qianlong Emperor's visit. The curves of the lake were softened by weeping willows; pavilions and ornamental bridges dotted its shores and inlets. I wandered to the end of the spit of rock where the emperor had cast his fishing line. It was like walking in a Chinese ink-and-water painting.</div>

<div class="line_en">We had been joined for the meal by a young officer from the local government trade office, Mr Liu, and a chef named Chen. When we had finished eating, Liu and I went for a walk along the Grand Canal at the south of the old town. Peach trees and weeping willows grew along the banks. People were ballroom dancing outside pavilions festooned in fairy lights. We caught the last pleasure boat of the night, and as we were the only passengers, we asked the driver to switch off the lamps. So we stood on the prow with the breeze in our faces and tried to imagine that we were emperors, on a visit from Beijing to sample the delights of the south ('and to find a pretty concubine' said Liu, with a laugh).</div>

<div class="line_en">Perhaps Yangzhou had a particular meaning for me because I was in the midst of reading Cao Xueqin's great eighteenth-century Chinese novel, A Dream of Red Mansions (also known as The Story of the Stone). It is a family saga, the tale of four generations of the Jia clan who live together in two neighbouring mansions in a notional Chinese capital in northern China. Although the novel is set in the north, Cao himself came from the southern Yangtze region, and the life he describes resembles that of the Yangzhou literati. Cao wrote the novel while living in poverty in Beijing, after the collapse of his once-illustrious family's fortunes. Many of the characters are thought to be be based on real people, the friends and relatives of Cao's own youth, and it is generally seen as a nostalgic evocation of his past.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="也许，扬州对我意义特殊，是因为我正在读十八世纪曹雪芹所写的伟大古典小说《红楼梦》。这是一部宏大的家族史，讲了望族贾家四代的故事。他们住在一个架空的中国北方都城，分居两座相邻的府邸。曹雪芹也曾是纨绔公子哥，后来显赫一时的家族出了事败落。他写作这本小说时，正在北京过着穷困潦倒的日子。据说书中很多人物都有真实的原型，是曹雪芹青少年时期的亲朋好友。人们普遍认为这本书是他自己对过去生活的追忆和怀念。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the more modest He Garden, built in the nineteenth century by a local official, I climbed the steps of a rockery to a tiny pavilion, where I sat and wrote for a while, engulfed by the intoxicating scent of winter plum blossom. Down below, in a two-storey building with a tiled roof that curved up at the ends, two musicians were practising. A middle-aged lady sung a plaintive tune, while an er hu player drew his bow over strings. Before me lay a miniature landscape tailored to appeal to a certain Chinese literary sensibility. Every feature had a name of poetic allusion. There were hidden promonteries from which to view the garden, places where a scholar might pause and be inspired to compose a few lines. At the far end of the complex was a pond designed to mirror the moon's reflection. Sitting in my eyrie, writing at a marble table, I felt at peace.</div>

<div class="line_en">Somehow the elegance of the city had endured, despite everything. Like almost anywhere in China, Yangzhou had been damaged by the communists, who demolished its ancient city walls, carved up the salt merchants' mansions, and unleashed the chaos of the Cultural Revolution. Its relative obscurity, however, had saved it from the worst ravages of the reform period. In Suzhou, I'd seen how the Xuanmiao Temple was penned in by American fast-food outlets, and the bicycle rickshaws plastered with McDonalds advertisements. No one had bothered to smear Yangzhou with such tacky commercialisation. Slum buildings along the canal had been cleared, and the banks of the canal redeveloped, but local leaders had decided to protect and revive the old city. High-rises were banned in the historic centre, and they were gradually restoring the salt merchants' mansions to their former splendour.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="历史的风浪中，这座城市不知怎么的，仍然保持了优雅恬静。和中国几乎所有的城市一样，扬州在二十世纪的政治动荡中也遭到不小的破坏：古城墙被拆毁，旧时盐商们的豪宅被分割损坏。“文革”期间的混乱当然也没能幸免。不过，这里相对没那么显眼，躲过了改革开放时期最可怕的大肆破坏和建设。我在苏州目睹了被美国快餐店包围的玄妙观和贴着麦当劳广告的人力车。但扬州就没这么俗气、没这么商业化了，因为没人想到来开发这个市场。运河边的棚户区与危楼倒是被清除了，两岸重新进行了开发，但当地领导们决定要保护和复兴这座古城。历史遗迹聚集的中心不允许修高楼，盐商的宅子也在一步步恢复往日的华丽光彩。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In English translation, it is a novel in five volumes, and for the few months I spent reading it, it took over my life. The story begins in the 'golden days' of the family's history, when the young Jia cousins amuse themselves in the Prospect Garden. They hold poetry competitions, play drinking games, devour hairy crabs and admire chrysanthemums. As the novel progresses, the tale becomes darker. There are suicides, kidnappings and savage betrayals. Eventually the family's wealth is confiscated by the imperial authorities, and the Jias' reputation lost amid a storm of scandal. But I travelled to Yangzhou when I was still absorbed in the first, happier volumes of the novel, the Golden Days, and everything I experienced there seemed to resonate with the gilded life of the Jias.</div>

A gentle mist blotted the willow trees as I hurried along the canal to meet him. Outside the mansion's long, grey-brick walls, some middle-aged ladies were practising Tai Chi. Inside, Mr Xia was waiting for me, in a grand hall with high ceilings and wooden panelling, wearing a baseball cap and clutching his jar of home-brewed tea. Once, this was part of the inner quarters of the mansion, where the grand ladies of the household would have sat at their needlework, but now it was crowded with working men and women, chatting and laughing quietly over their breakfasts.

<div class="line_en">Most advocates of Chinese local cuisines insist that theirs is the best in China, and disparage the cooking of other regions. But in Yangzhou I was tempted to agree with the culinary patriots. Yangzhou food, as they say, combines the strengths of the cooking traditions of northern and southern China. It is about the art of balance, the miraculous transformation of ingredients in the pot that the chef Yi Yin had talked about more than three thousand years ago. Yangzhou cooks are famously particular in their selection of raw ingredients. They insist on the tenderest of spinach leaves, the hearts of cabbages, the crispest tips of bamboo shoots. They have rules on seasonality: no drunken crabs after the Lantern Festival, no hairtail anchovy after the Feast of Clear Brightness. And lion's head meatballs, though available all year round, are cooked with bamboo shoots in spring, freshwater mussel in summer, crab coral in autumn, and wind-dried chicken in winter.</div>

<div class="line_en">Yet despite their strikingly different characters, the cuisines of Sichuan and Yangzhou are nonetheless related. They are linked by the artery of the Yangtze River, and also by their enviable geographies -- the fecund soils and abundant produce that helped to supply their famous kitchens, and which enabled the more fortunate of their people to lead lives of great luxury and refinement. Talented cooks in either place conjure up banquets of unbelievable variety, but they express themselves in different registers. 'Huaiyang cuisine is like Sichuanese cuisine without the spiciness,' as Mr Xia told me once. In the Tang Dynasty, they used to say 'Yangzhou first and Chengdu second', in wonder at the flourishing economies and cultures of these two beautiful cities.</div>

Like one of the Jia cousins in A Dream of Red Mansions, it sits in a landscaped garden, ornaments of jade and gold in its hair, composing poetry at a marble table. It seduces by understatement, with its delicate colours (pale pink, green, yellow), fine stocks, soft and soothing textures, and sensitivity to salt and sweetness.</div>

<div class="line_en">Two and a half centuries after the Qianlong Emperor had been mesmerised by Yangzhou, the city still had an irresistible pull, and it worked on me like a tonic. Softly and imperceptibly, it melted away my bitterness and exasperation at China. Chef Chen, to whom I had been introduced at that first fine meal with my friends at the culinary association, told me: 'Hunanese cooking, with all those bold and brassy flavours, is the food of war -- look at the military leaders it nourished. Yangzhou food is the food of peace. In times of harmony, that is what you should eat.' Somehow his words expressed perfectly my own feeling that being in Yangzhou was, for me, a kind of peace after the war of writing my Hunanese cookbook.</div>

<div class="line_en">Many Chinese friends have spoken to me over the last few years of a historical progression from 'eating to fill your belly' (chi bao), through 'eating plenty of rich food', (chi hao) to 'eating skilfully' (chi qiao). In the past, they say, food was just about sustenance; starvation was a constant threat. With growing wealth, the Chinese began to eat as much meat and fish as they could, as if to make up for years of deprivation. Now, though, the thrill of plenty is wearing off, and a growing number are trying to eat with more discernment, seeking out 'green food products', reducing their consumption of animal foods, and ordering less gluttonously in restaurants.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="很多中国朋友都曾跟我谈到过，过去这些年来人们经历了“吃饱”到“吃好”再到“吃巧”的历史进程。他们说，过去总是饿肚子，吃饭就是吃个饱，为了活命。后来手里的钱多了，中国人开始大鱼大肉地胡吃海塞，仿佛是要弥补多年来的匮乏与饥饿。而现在，最初富起来的那种激动逐渐褪却，越来越多的人开始对吃有了品位和讲究，注重“绿色食品”，减少食肉吃荤，在餐馆点菜也没那么铺张浪费了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In Yangzhou, after my own period of 'eating plenty of rich food' in China, I found myself eating more 'skilfully'. I dined out with the officers of the culinary association on food that wasn't full of colourings and MSG. I ate well, but not excessively, at the old Yechun teahouse by the canal, famous for its buns and dumplings. And I wasn't offered meat from a single endangered species. Gradually, my appetite returned, and eating became a pleasure once more. I felt my spirits lifting.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="而我在扬州时，也恰恰是经历了在中国“吃好”的日子，开始吃得更“巧”了。我跟烹饪协会那些人出去吃的东西，没有那么多人工色素，也不会放味精。在运河边历史悠久、以点心出名的冶春茶社，我吃得很好，但没有过饱，也没谁给我端上任何濒危动物的肉。我的胃口逐渐回来了。吃，又变成人生一大乐事。我感觉整个人的精神都振奋爽利起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was my last day in Yangzhou, and I wanted to visit a mansion near the Grand Canal that had caught my eye, several times, as I passed. It was a vast and imposing complex of courtyards and halls that had just been restored and opened as a museum. So I bought my ticket and went inside. Somewhere in the midst of the house, in a small courtyard with its own well, I was pleased to find an old-fashioned kitchen. The bright, airy room was dominated by an enormous cooking range, built in brick, covered in whitewashed plaster, and decorated with blue line-drawings of a blooming lotus and a fish. On top, a Kitchen God presided in his shrine. There were four 'fire-mouths' on the stove, two with wooden lids covering inset woks, one for the rice-steamer and one for a stack of bamboo steamers to cook buns and dumplings.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="扬州之旅的最后一天，我想去看看大运河附近的一座宅院。经过那里好几次，我早就注意到了。宅院很大、很壮观，有好几个院落和大堂，刚刚修复好，作为博物馆对外开放。我买好票，走了进去。走到差不多中间的地方，小小的院落里有口井，旁边是个老式厨房，让我十分高兴。这个厨房亮堂堂的，通风很好。引人注目的巨大灶头是用砖砌成的，刷了一层白浆，用简单的蓝色线条勾勒了盛开的莲花与鲤鱼。最上面是灶王爷威风凛凛的神龛。灶上有四个“火嘴”，有两个上面摆着下沉式炒锅，盖着木盖子；一个上面用来蒸饭，还有一个上放着一叠竹蒸笼，用来蒸点心。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In a sense, Yangzhou rescued me, and my Chinese food-writing career. Like a dream of red mansions, it reminded me, not only of the vanished elegance of a certain aspect of the Chinese past, but also of my own lost love for China. Chengdu as I had known it might have been swept away by the tidal wave of real-estate development, but in Yangzhou, with its understated charm, its delicious food, and its exceptionally kind and elegant people, I found something of the same enchantment. Yangzhou rekindled the fire. I knew then that I could, and would write this book, and that there was life yet in my relationship with China.</div>

<div class="line_en">As we chatted, I became aware of a man and woman watching me from the edge of the room, and discreetly eavesdropping on our conversation. Eventually, when the old men had exhausted their kitchen memories and bid me goodbye, these two came forward and greeted me. 'Hello, may we trouble you a little?' said the man. 'My name is Zhang Wenjie, and I am the manager of the People's Number One Hospital, which owns this land. This is Yuan Yuan, the manager of the museum.' He seemed friendly and open, and Mrs Yuan had a gentle, soft face and was dressed in a fitted coat, with a mother-of-pearl clasp in her hair. 'Won't you come with us, and drink some tea?'</div>

<div class="line_en">It was the only old Yangzhou range I'd seen, and I wasn't sure how everything worked. Luckily for me, the other visitors that day were three elderly men in Mao suits who remembered such stoves from their childhoods. 'When we were young,' said one, 'everyone had ranges like this. You see those cubbyholes at the back, they were for seasonings: you know, the salt, the oil, sugar, soy sauce and vinegar. And those cupboards underneath, you could store your wok brushes there, or put wet shoes inside to dry them out. The hooks hanging from the ceiling were for hams and smoked ribs. And you stacked up the firewood behind the stove.'</div>

<div class="line_en">There was some unspoken eagerness behind his invitation, but I had no idea what it meant. They led me through a labyrinth of courtyards, and then up a little path to an anomalous two-storey building in a walled garden. It was built in the Western colonial style, with red and grey bricks, casement windows and a wooden verandah, and stood awkwardly within the walls of a traditional Chinese mansion. The ground floor had been turned into a teahouse for tourists, but we didn't stop there: they led me up a wooden staircase to the private rooms on the upper storey. The innermost room had been restored in the 1930s 'European' style, with a fireplace, glass-fronted cabinets, and Chinese wooden sofas around a coffee table. In the corner, a wind-up gramophone sat on a table, its brass horn flaring above. 'This is known as the yang lou, the foreigners' building,' said Mr Zhang.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的邀请中有种无言的急迫，但我完全不知道他在急什么。两人领我穿过迷宫般的院落，接着沿一条小路来到一个环绕着围墙的花园中。那里有一栋很奇怪的双层建筑，是西方殖民风格，有红灰两色的砖、铰链窗和一个木头搭建的露台，在这个传统中国风的宅院里显得很是格格不入。一楼是改建后供游客休憩的茶社，但我们没有在那里停下。两个人继续带着我，沿着木楼梯上了二楼的包间。最里面的那个包间是二十世纪三十年代的“欧式”风格，有一个壁炉、玻璃柜、一张咖啡桌周围摆着中式木沙发。角落的桌子上摆着一台老式留声机，黄铜喇叭闪闪发光。“这个叫洋楼。”张先生说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We sat around the coffee table, and they offered me tea. Again, I had the sense that there was more to their hospitality than met the eye, but they just smiled and chatted politely. I noticed that there was an old 78 record on the gramophone, and suggested that we play it. To oblige me, Mr Zhang cranked up the machine, and set the needle in the crackly groove. I was expecting a musical glimpse of the thirties, something like 'Nights of Shanghai' by Zhou Xuan. It would have suited the atmosphere so perfectly, the gentle urbanity of my hosts, the delicacy of the tea, and the cosmopolitan atmosphere of this curious room. So it was a shock when we heard the shrill marching tune of a Maoist anthem. It jarred, horribly. We smiled at one another in embarrassment as Mr Zhang lifted the needle and let the gramophone wind down in silence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们围着咖啡桌落座，他俩给我上了茶。我再次感觉他俩的热情背后有什么深意。但他们只是微笑着，礼貌地跟我聊天。我发现留声机上摆着一张胶木78转粗纹唱片，建议放来听听。我这话一出口，张先生便殷勤地转起那笨重的机器，把唱针放到那仿佛一碰就要裂的木头上。我本以为会飘散出的是三十年代的那种音乐，比如周璇唱的“夜上海”，那可太应景了。两位主人温文尔雅，清茶飘香，再加上这个奇怪的房间里弥漫的大都市气息。所以，当那慷慨激昂的毛主席赞歌尖锐地响起时，我们都惊了一跳。音乐断断续续的，很刺耳。我们彼此尴尬地笑笑，张先生赶紧把唱针抬起来，让留声机无声地转着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">'Let me tell you the story of this place,' said Mr Zhang. 'The mansion was built in 1904 by a Yangzhou man named Wu Yinsun, a customs official who was posted to Ningbo, in neighbouring Zhejiang Province. He intended to return here when he retired from official life, so he bought the land, and built the complex mainly in the Zhejiang style. His plan was to start a trading business, so he had this building designed as a suitable place for receiving yang ren, foreign businessmen. But Wu never returned to Yangzhou, so the foreign businessmen never came. In 1949, the whole mansion was requisitioned by the new communist government, who gave it to the Number One People's Hospital. They converted it into living quarters for hospital workers: at one time it was home to a hundred families. But this building, the yang lou, was left to decay. The verandahs collapsed, and it became unsafe to enter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我给您讲讲这个地方的故事吧，”张先生说，“这宅院是一九零四年时扬州人吴引孙修的。他是海关监督，还是浙江宁波的道台，想退休了回到这儿来住，于是买了这块地，修的时候主要参照浙江的风格。他想在这儿做贸易，所以这栋楼是专门为接待洋人修的。但是吴引孙再也没回过扬州，所以也没来过什么洋人。一九四九年，新政府把整栋宅院都充公了，给了第一人民医院。医院就把这里改造成职工宿舍楼，曾经住过一百户人呢。但是这栋洋楼呢，就没人管，荒废了。露台都垮了，进来都不安全。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">'Now we've restored it, as you can see,' he said, gesturing towards the sleek new wood of the verandah, the neat brickwork. Then he smiled, a little bashful. 'In fact, you are the first foreigner who has ever come into the yang lou, that's why we wanted to invite you.' He and Mrs Yuan waited, a little nervously, for my response.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“现在我们修复了，你也看到了。”他说，指着露台上光滑的新木头和整齐的砖墙。接着他有些不好意思地笑了。“其实啊，您是第一个到这栋洋楼来的外国人，所以我们想邀请您来喝喝茶。”他和袁姐都有点紧张地等待我的回答。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I was overcome with a sudden sense of all the time that had passed since I first came as a foreigner to China, and of all that had happened to me in those years. I had learned to speak Chinese, and in some ways to think and feel in the language. I had developed deep ties of affection with my Chinese friends, and had roamed all over the country. I had learned to eat everything, and had even trained as a Chinese chef. Yet however much of an insider I had become, in some ways, it seemed, I would always be a yang ren, a foreigner, a lao wai. It was a sobering thought, but a sweet one, under the circumstances.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我心中一下子涌上很多关于过去的记忆：作为一个外国人，来到中国已经是多年前的事情了。这些年发生了好多事。我学会了说中文，甚至在某些方面还使用这种语言来思考和感受。我和中国朋友们建立了深厚的友谊和关爱，还在全国走南闯北。我什么都吃了一点，甚至还参加培训，成了个比较专业的中餐厨子。然而，不管我已经多么融入这个国家、被其同化，现在看来，我总还是一个洋人、外国人、老外。这突如其来的想法让人清醒，不过在这个场景下，也显得挺可爱、挺亲切。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then Mr Zhang summoned the photographer who had been waiting in the wings, and asked if I would mind if they marked the occasion for posterity.
