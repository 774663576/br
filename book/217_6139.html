<div class="line_en">I crept to their doors and listened; they was snoring. So I tiptoed along, and got down stairs all right. There warn't a sound anywheres. I peeped through a crack of the dining-room door, and see the men that was watching the corpse all sound asleep on their chairs. The door was open into the parlor, where the corpse was laying, and there was a candle in both rooms. I passed along, and the parlor door was open; but I see there warn't nobody in there but the remainders of Peter; so I shoved on by; but the front door was locked, and the key wasn't there. Just then I heard somebody coming down the stairs, back behind me. I run in the parlor and took a swift look around, and the only place I see to hide the bag was in the coffin. The lid was shoved along about a foot, showing the dead man's face down in there, with a wet cloth over it, and his shroud on. I tucked the moneybag in under the lid, just down beyond where his hands was crossed, which made me creep, they was so cold, and then I run back across the room and in behind the door.</div>

<div class="line_en">I slipped up to bed, feeling ruther blue, on accounts of the thing playing out that way after I had took so much trouble and run so much resk about it. Says I, if it could stay where it is, all right; because when we get down the river a hundred mile or two I could write back to Mary Jane, and she could dig him up again and get it; but that ain't the thing that's going to happen; the thing that's going to happen is, the money 'll be found when they come to screw on the lid. Then the king 'll get it again, and it 'll be a long day before he gives anybody another chance to smouch it from him. Of course I WANTED to slide down and get it out of there, but I dasn't try it. Every minute it was getting earlier now, and pretty soon some of them watchers would begin to stir, and I might get catched – catched with six thousand dollars in my hands that nobody hadn't hired me to take care of. I don't wish to be mixed up in no such business as that, I says to myself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我一溜烟上了床，心里有些不称心，因为我费尽了心思，又冒了这么大的风险，却只能搞成这个样子。我在心里思忖，如果钱袋能在那里安然无恙，我到大河下游一两百英里地以后，便可以写个信给玛丽·珍妮，她就能把棺材掘起来，把钱拿到手。不过嘛，事情不会是这个样子的。可能发生的情况是人家来钉棺材盖的时候，钱袋给发现了。这样，国王又会得到这笔钱。在这以后，要找个机会，从他手里弄出来，就不是一朝一夕的事了。当然啰，我一心想溜下去，把钱从棺材里取出来，不过我没有这样做。天色每一分钟都渐渐亮起来了，守灵的人，有一些会很快醒来的，我说不定会给逮住啊——逮住时手里还明明有六千块大洋，而且谁也没有雇我来照管这笔钱啊。这样的事，我可不愿意牵扯进去。我心里就是这么想的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The person coming was Mary Jane. She went to the coffin, very soft, and kneeled down and looked in; then she put up her handkerchief, and I see she begun to cry, though I couldn't hear her, and her back was to me. I slid out, and as I passed the dining-room I thought I'd make sure them watchers hadn't seen me; so I looked through the crack, and everything was all right. They hadn't stirred.</div>

<div class="line_en">When I got down stairs in the morning the parlor was shut up, and the watchers was gone. There warn't nobody around but the family and the widow Bartley and our tribe. I watched their faces to see if anything had been happening, but I couldn't tell.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="早上我下楼梯的时候，客厅的门是关了的，守灵的人都走了。四周没有别的什么人，只有家里的人，还有巴特雷寡妇，还有我们这帮家伙。我仔细察看他们的脸，看有没有发生什么情况，可是看不出来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Towards the middle of the day the undertaker come with his man, and they set the coffin in the middle of the room on a couple of chairs, and then set all our chairs in rows, and borrowed more from the neighbors till the hall and the parlor and the dining-room was full. I see the coffin lid was the way it was before, but I dasn't go to look in under it, with folks around.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="快正午的时候，承办殡葬的那一些人到了，他们把棺材搁在屋子中央几张椅子上，又放好了一排椅子，包括原来自家的和跟邻居借的，把大厅、客厅、餐室都塞得满满的。我看到棺材盖还是原来见到的那个样子，不过当着四周这么多人，我没有往盖子下面望一望究竟。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then the people begun to flock in, and the beats and the girls took seats in the front row at the head of the coffin, and for a half an hour the people filed around slow, in single rank, and looked down at the dead man's face a minute, and some dropped in a tear, and it was all very still and solemn, only the girls and the beats holding handkerchiefs to their eyes and keeping their heads bent, and sobbing a little. There warn't no other sound but the scraping of the feet on the floor and blowing noses – because people always blows them more at a funeral than they do at other places except church.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="随后人们开始往里挤，那两个败类和几位闺女在棺材前面的前排就坐。人们排成单行，一个个绕着棺材慢慢走过去，还低下头去看看死者的遗容，这样每人有一分钟的光景，一共半个钟点，有些人还掉了几滴眼泪。一切都又安静，又肃穆，只有闺女们和两个败类手帕掩着眼睛，垂着脑袋，发出一两声呜咽。除了脚擦着地板的声音和擤鼻涕的声音以外，没有任何别的声音——因为人们总是在丧仪上比在别的场合更多地擤鼻涕。教堂里除外。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They had borrowed a melodeum – a sick one; and when everything was ready a young woman set down and worked it, and it was pretty skreeky and colicky, and everybody joined in and sung, and Peter was the only one that had a good thing, according to my notion. Then the Reverend Hobson opened up, slow and solemn, and begun to talk; and straight off the most outrageous row busted out in the cellar a body ever heard; it was only one dog, but he made a most powerful racket, and he kept it up right along; the parson he had to stand there, over the coffin, and wait – you couldn't hear yourself think. It was right down awkward, and nobody didn't seem to know what to do. But pretty soon they see that long-legged undertaker make a sign to the preacher as much as to say, "Don't you worry – just depend on me." Then he stooped down and begun to glide along the wall, just his shoulders showing over the people's heads. So he glided along, and the powwow and racket getting more and more outrageous all the time; and at last, when he had gone around two sides of the room, he disappears down cellar. Then in about two seconds we heard a whack, and the dog he finished up with a most amazing howl or two, and then everything was dead still, and the parson begun his solemn talk where he left off. In a minute or two here comes this undertaker's back and shoulders gliding along the wall again; and so he glided and glided around three sides of the room, and then rose up, and shaded his mouth with his hands, and stretched his neck out towards the preacher, over the people's heads, and says, in a kind of a coarse whisper, "HE HAD A RAT!" Then he drooped down and glided along the wall again to his place. You could see it was a great satisfaction to the people, because naturally they wanted to know. A little thing like that don't cost nothing, and it's just the little things that makes a man to be looked up to and liked. There warn't no more popular man in town than what that undertaker was.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们借来了一架风琴——一架有毛病的风琴。等到一切安排停当，一位年轻的妇女坐下弹了起来。风琴象害了疝气痛那样吱吱吱地呻吟，大伙儿一个个随声唱起来。依我看，只有彼得一个人落得个清闲。随后霍勃逊牧师开了个场，语气缓慢而庄重。也正是在这个时刻，地窖里有一只狗高声嗥叫，这可大杀风景。光只有一条狗，却已吵得大伙儿六神无主，而且狗还叫个不停。闹得牧师不得不站在棺材前边不动，在原地等着——闹得连你自己在心里想些什么你自己也听不见。这情景着实叫人难堪，可谁也不知道该怎么办才好。可是没有多久，只见那个腿长长的承办殡葬的人朝牧师打了个手势，仿佛在说，“不用担心——一切有我呢。”随后他弯下腰来，沿着墙滑过去，人们只见他的肩膀在大伙儿的脑袋上面移动。他就这么滑过去。与此同时，吠叫声越来越刺耳。后来，他滑过了屋里两边的墙，消失在地窖里。接下来，一刹那间，只听得“啪”的一声，那条狗最后发出了一两声十分凄厉的叫声，就一切死一般地寂静了。牧师在中断的地方重新接下，去说他庄重的话语。一两分钟以后，又见到承办殡葬的人，他的背、他的肩膀又在大伙儿的脑袋后面移动。他就这么滑动，划过了屋子里面三堵墙，随后站直了身子，手掩住了嘴巴，伸出脖子，朝着牧师和大伙儿的脑袋，操着沙嘎的低声说，“它逮住了一只耗子！”随后又弯下身子，沿着墙滑过去，回到了自己的位子上。我看得很清楚，大伙儿都很满意，因为究竟是什么个原因，他们自然都想知道。这么一点点儿小事，本来说不上什么，可正是在这么一点点儿小事上，关系到一个人是否受到尊重，招人喜欢。在整个儿这个镇子上，再也没有别的人比这个承办殡葬的人更受欢迎的了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When the place was packed full the undertaker he slid around in his black gloves with his softy soothering ways, putting on the last touches, and getting people and things all ship-shape and comfortable, and making no more sound than a cat. He never spoke; he moved people around, he squeezed in late ones, he opened up passageways, and done it with nods, and signs with his hands. Then he took his place over against the wall. He was the softest, glidingest, stealthiest man I ever see; and there warn't no more smile to him than there is to a ham.</div>

<div class="line_en">Well, the funeral sermon was very good, but pison long and tiresome; and then the king he shoved in and got off some of his usual rubbage, and at last the job was through, and the undertaker begun to sneak up on the coffin with his screw-driver. I was in a sweat then, and watched him pretty keen. But he never meddled at all; just slid the lid along as soft as mush, and screwed it down tight and fast. So there I was! I didn't know whether the money was in there or not. So, says I, s'pose somebody has hogged that bag on the sly? – now how do I know whether to write to Mary Jane or not? S'pose she dug him up and didn't find nothing, what would she think of me? Blame it, I says, I might get hunted up and jailed; I'd better lay low and keep dark, and not write at all; the thing's awful mixed now; trying to better it, I've worsened it a hundred times, and I wish to goodness I'd just let it alone, dad fetch the whole business!</div>

<div class="line_en">The king he visited around in the evening, and sweetened everybody up, and made himself ever so friendly; and he give out the idea that his congregation over in England would be in a sweat about him, so he must hurry and settle up the estate right away and leave for home. He was very sorry he was so pushed, and so was everybody; they wished he could stay longer, but they said they could see it couldn't be done. And he said of course him and William would take the girls home with them; and that pleased everybody too, because then the girls would be well fixed and amongst their own relations; and it pleased the girls, too – tickled them so they clean forgot they ever had a trouble in the world; and told him to sell out as quick as he wanted to, they would be ready. Them poor things was that glad and happy it made my heart ache to see them getting fooled and lied to so, but I didn't see no safe way for me to chip in and change the general tune.</div>

A couple of nigger traders come along, and the king sold them the niggers reasonable, for three-day drafts as they called it, and away they went, the two sons up the river to Memphis, and their mother down the river to Orleans. I thought them poor girls and them niggers would break their hearts for grief; they cried around each other, and took on so it most made me down sick to see it. The girls said they hadn't ever dreamed of seeing the family separated or sold away from the town. I can't ever get it out of my memory, the sight of them poor miserable girls and niggers hanging around each other's necks and crying; and I reckon I couldn't a stood it all, but would a had to bust out and tell on our gang if I hadn't knowed the sale warn't no account and the niggers would be back home in a week or two.</div>
