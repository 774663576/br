<div class="line_en">With the running of the blood Simon's fit passed into the weariness of sleep. He lay in the mat of creepers while the evening advanced and the cannon continued to play. At last he woke and saw dimly the dark earth close by his cheek. Still he did not move but lay there, his face sideways on the earth, his eyes looking dully before him. Then he turned over, drew his feet under him and laid hold of the creepers to pull himself up. When the creepers shook the flies exploded from the guts with a vicious note and clamped back on again. Simon got to his feet. The light was unearthly. The Lord of the Flies hung on his stick like a black ball.</div>

<div class="line_en">Over the island the build-up of clouds continued. A steady current of heated air rose all day from the mountain and was thrust to ten thousand feet; revolving masses of gas piled up the static until the air was ready to explode. By early evening the sun had gone and a brassy glare had taken the place of clear daylight. Even the air that pushed in from the sea was hot and held no refreshment. Colors drained from water and trees and pink surfaces of rock, and the white and brown clouds brooded. Nothing prospered but the flies who blackened their lord and made the spilt guts look like a heap of glistening coal. Even when the vessel broke in Simon's nose and the blood gushed out they left him alone, preferring the pig's high flavor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="岛的上空乌云还在集结。暑热的气流整天不断地从山上升起，直冲到一万英尺的高空；无数旋转着的气团堆聚起静电，空中似乎随时都可能发生爆炸。将近傍晚时分，太阳已经落山了，黄铜色的炫目的光取代了明亮的日光。甚至连从海上吹来的微风也是热乎乎的，没有能使人恢复精神的凉意。水上，树上，岩石粉红的表面上，色彩都在暗淡下去，灰褐色的乌云低覆着。除了苍蝇闹哄哄地使蝇王变得更黑，使掏出的内脏看上去就像一堆闪闪发亮的煤块，一切都在沉寂下去，甚至当西蒙鼻子里有一根血管破裂，鲜血喷洒而出的时候，苍蝇也宁可选择猪的臭味，而任凭西蒙留在一边。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Nothing replied. Simon turned away from the open space and crawled through the creepers till he was in the dusk of the forest. He walked drearily between the trunks, his face empty of expression, and the blood was dry round his mouth and chin. Only sometimes as he lifted the ropes of creeper aside and chose his direction from the trend of the land, he mouthed words that did not reach the air.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没有回答。西蒙转脸避开空地，慢慢地爬出了藤蔓，他处在森林的薄暮之中。西蒙意气消沉地在树干之中走着，脸上毫无表情，嘴上和下巴上血迹斑斑。只是有时候他撩开一根根藤蔓，根据地形的趋势选择方向，嘴中才嘟囔着听不出话音的话语。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Presently the creepers festooned the trees less frequently and there was a scatter of pearly light from the sky down through the trees. This was the backbone of the island, the slightly higher land that lay beneath the mountain where the forest was no longer deep jungle. Here there were wide spaces interspersed with thickets and huge trees and the trend of the ground led him up as the forest opened. He pushed on, staggering sometimes with his weariness but never stopping. The usual brightness was gone from his eyes and he walked with a sort of glum determination like an old man.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="过一会儿树上交织垂挂下来的藤蔓越来越少，树丛中筛下自天而降的珍珠色的散光。这儿是这个岛的岛脊，山下平卧着稍稍高起的地形，树林也不再是密密的丛林。在这儿，宽阔的空地上散布着乱丛棵子和高大的树木，他顺着地势向上，树林更开阔了。他继续朝前走，由于疲劳而跌跌撞撞，但并不停止前进。平素明亮的眼神从他的双眸中消失了，西蒙像个老头儿似的，以一种阴郁的决心不停地走着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The flies had found the figure too. The life-like movement would scare them off for a moment so that they made a dark cloud round the head. Then as the blue material of the parachute collapsed the corpulent figure would bow forward, sighing, and the flies settle once more.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="苍蝇也已经发现了那个身形。有生命的运动一时把它们吓得飞开了，苍蝇围着那东西的脑袋形成一朵黑云。随后蓝色的降落伞倒坍下来，臃肿的身形更朝前倾，发出叹息的声音，而苍蝇则再一次停落下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A buffet of wind made him stagger and he saw that he was out in the open, on rock, under a brassy sky. He found his legs were weak and his tongue gave him pain all the time. When the wind reached the mountain-top he could see something happen, a flicker of blue stuff against brown clouds. He pushed himself forward and the wind came again, stronger now, cuffing the forest heads till they ducked and roared. Simon saw a humped thing suddenly sit up on the top and look down at him. He hid his face, and toiled on.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一阵风吹得他踉踉跄跄，西蒙看到自己已经到了开阔地，在黄铜色的天穹之下，在山岩之上。他感到自己的双腿没劲，舌头一直发痛。风吹到山顶时他看到了什么东西在动弹：背衬着乌云有一样蓝色的东西在摇曳。西蒙努力朝前走着，风又来了，此刻风势更强，猛吹过森林里成片的树梢，树梢被吹低了头，发出阵阵的怒号。西蒙看到山顶上有一个隆起的东西突然端坐起来，俯看着他。西蒙把脸遮住，继续吃力地往前走。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Simon felt his knees smack the rock. He crawled forward and soon he understood. The tangle of lines showed him the mechanics of this parody; he examined the white nasal bones, the teeth, the colors of corruption. He saw how pitilessly the layers of rubber and canvas held together the poor body that should be rotting away. Then the wind blew again and the figure lifted, bowed, and breathed foully at him. Simon knelt on all fours and was sick till his stomach was empty. Then he took the lines in his hands; he freed them from the rocks and the figure from the wind's indignity.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="西蒙感到膝盖猛地撞到山岩上。他慢慢地朝前蠕动着，一会儿他就明白了。绳索绕作一团、互相牵扯，为他展示了这种拙劣模仿的动力结构；他细看着白花花的鼻梁骨，牙齿，腐烂不堪的外貌。他看到一层层的橡皮和帆布多么无情地把本该烂掉的可怜的身子拉扯在一起。接着又吹过了一阵风，那身形又被提起来，鞠着躬，朝他散发出一股恶臭。西蒙四肢贴地，把肚子里的东西都呕了出来。随后他把降落伞的伞绳揪到手中，把缠在山岩上的解开，那身形这才摆脱了狂风的肆虐。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At last he turned away and looked down at the beaches. The fire by the platform appeared to be out, or at least making no smoke. Further along the beach, beyond the little river and near a great slab of rock, a thin trickle of smoke was climbing into the sky. Simon, forgetful of the flies, shaded his eyes with both hands and peered at the smoke. Even at that distance it was possible to see that most of the boys -- perhaps all of the boys -- were there. So they had shifted camp then, away from the beast. As Simon thought this, he turned to the poor broken thing that sat stinking by his side. The beast was harmless and horrible; and the news must reach the others as soon as possible. He started down the mountain and his legs gave beneath him. Even with great care the best he could do was a stagger.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后他转过脸去俯瞰海滩。平台旁的火堆看来已经灭了，至少没有在冒烟。沿着海滩再过去，在小河的另一边，靠近一大块平坦的岩石，一缕细烟在空中冉冉上升。西蒙忘掉了苍蝇，他用双手圈住眼睛凝视着烟。即使在那样的距离，还可以依稀看到大多数的孩子——也许是全部孩子——都在那儿。那么他们是为了避开野兽，已经把营盘搬过去了吧。想到这儿，西蒙把身子转向坐在他身旁那发出恶臭的、可怜的破烂东西。野兽是无害而又是恐怖的，必须尽早地把这个消息传给其他人。他开始走下山去。下面两条腿有点支撑不住，即使他尽很大的努力，也只能做到蹒跚而行。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Long before Ralph and Piggy came up with Jack's lot, they could hear the party. There was a stretch of grass in a place where the palms left a wide band of turf between the forest and the shore. Just one step down from the edge of the turf was the white, blown sand of above high water, warm, dry, trodden. Below that again was a rock that stretched away toward the lagoon. Beyond was a short stretch of sand and then the edge of the water. A fire burned on the rock and fat dripped from the roasting pigmeat into the invisible flames. All the boys of the island, except Piggy, Ralph, Simon, and the two tending the pig, were grouped on the turf. They were laughing, singing, lying, squatting, or standing on the grass, holding food in their hands. But to judge by the greasy faces, the meat eating was almost done; and some held coconut shells in their hands and were drinking from them. Before the party had started a great log had been dragged into the center of the lawn and Jack, painted and garlanded, sat there like an idol. There were piles of meat on green leaves near him, and fruit, and coconut shells full of drink.</div>

<div class="line_en">Piggy and Ralph came to the edge of the grassy platform; and the boys, as they noticed them, fell silent one by one till only the boy next to Jack was talking. Then the silence intruded even there and Jack turned where he sat. For a time he looked at them and the crackle of the fire was the loudest noise over the droning of the reef. Ralph looked away; and Sam, thinking that Ralph had turned to him accusingly, put down his gnawed bone with a nervous giggle. Ralph took an uncertain step, pointed to a palm tree, and whispered something inaudible to Piggy; and they both giggled like Sam. Lifting his feet high out of the sand, Ralph started to stroll past. Piggy tried to whistle.</div>

<div class="line_en">At this moment the boys who were cooking at the fire suddenly hauled off a great chunk of meat and ran with it toward the grass.

Piggy once more was the center of social derision so that everyone felt cheerful and normal.</div>

They moved a little farther off over the sand and Ralph watched the fire as he ate. He noticed, without understanding, how the flames were visible now against the dull light. Evening was come, not with calm beauty but with the threat of violence.</div>

<div class="line_en">The hunters were looking uneasily at the sky, flinching from the stroke of the drops. A wave of restlessness set the boys swaying and moving aimlessly. The flickering light became brighter and the blows of the thunder were only just bearable. The littluns began to run about, screaming.</div>

<div class="line_en">He ran stumbling through the thick sand to the open space of rock beyond the fire. Between the flashes of lightning the air was dark and terrible; and the boys followed him, clamorously. Roger became the pig, grunting and charging at Jack, who side-stepped. The hunters took their spears, the cooks took spits, and the rest clubs of firewood. A circling movement developed and a chant. While Roger mimed the terror of the pig, the littluns ran and jumped on the outside of the circle. Piggy and Ralph, under the threat of the sky, found themselves eager to take a place in this demented but partly secure society. They were glad to touch the brown backs of the fence that hemmed in the terror and made it governable.</div>

The water bounded from the mountain-top, tore leaves and branches from the trees, poured like a cold shower over the struggling heap on the sand.

<div class="line_en">The edge of the lagoon became a streak of phosphorescence which advanced minutely, as the great wave of the tide flowed.

<div class="line_en">Now a great wind blew the rain sideways, cascading the water from the forest trees. On the mountain-top the parachute filled and moved; the figure slid, rose to its feet, spun, swayed down through a vastness of wet air and trod with ungainly feet the tops of the high trees; falling, still falling, it sank toward the beach and the boys rushed screaming into the darkness. The parachute took the figure forward, furrowing the lagoon, and bumped it over the reef and out to sea.</div>

<div class="line_en">Toward midnight the rain ceased and the clouds drifted away, so that the sky was scattered once more with the incredible lamps of stars. Then the breeze died too and there was no noise save the drip and trickle of water that ran out of clefts and spilled down, leaf by leaf, to the brown earth of the island. The air was cool, moist, and clear; and presently even the sound of the water was still. The beast lay huddled on the pale beach and the stains spread, inch by inch.</div>

<div class="line_en">Along the shoreward edge of the shallows the advancing clearness was full of strange, moonbeam-bodied creatures with fiery eyes. Here and there a larger pebble clung to its own air and was covered with a coat of pearls. The tide swelled in over the rain-pitted sand and smoothed everything with a layer of silver. Now it touched the first of the stains that seeped from the broken body and the creatures made a moving patch of light as they gathered at the edge. The water rose farther and dressed Simon's coarse hair with brightness. The line of his cheek silvered and the turn of his shoulder became sculptured marble. The strange attendant creatures, with their fiery eyes and trailing vapors, busied themselves round his head. The body lifted a fraction of an inch from the sand and a bubble of air escaped from the mouth with a wet plop. Then it turned gently in the water.</div>
