<div class="line_en">The day after the conversation that we have just recorded, the Count of Monte Cristo did indeed leave for Auteuil, with Ali, several servants and some horses which he wanted to try out. The main reason for his departure -- which he had not even considered on the previous day and about which Andrea knew no more than he did -- was the arrival of Bertuccio, who had come back from Normandy with news about the house and the boat. The house was ready -- and the corvette, delivered a week before and anchored in a small bay where it remained with its six-man crew, after completing all the necessary formalities, was already fully prepared to set sail.</div>

<div class="line_en">Monsieur de Monte Cristo is warned that tonight a man will break into his house in the Champs-Elysées, in order to purloin some papers that he believes to be hidden in the bureau in the dressing-room. The Count of Monte Cristo is known to be brave enough not to turn for help to the police, whose involvement might seriously compromise the person who is giving this warning. Monsieur le Comte can administer his own justice, either by entering the dressing-room through an opening from the bedroom, or by lying in wait in the dressing-room. A lot of people and obvious precautions would surely scare away the burglar and deprive the count of this opportunity to discover an enemy who became known by chance to the writer of this warning -- a warning which he may not have the opportunity to repeat if this first attempt should fail and the wrongdoer attempt another.</div>

<div class="line_en">The count's first impulse was to think that this must be a thieves' trick, a crude trap warning him of a slight danger in order to expose him to a more serious one; so he was going to have the letter taken to a police commissioner -- despite (or, perhaps, because of) the instruction from his anonymous friend -- when he suddenly thought that there might, in fact, be some enemy peculiar to him, whom he alone could recognize and, in that event, take advantage of him as Fiesco did of the Moor who tried to assassinate him. The reader knows the count, so there is no need to mention that he was athletic and daring, and that his mind rebelled against the impossible with that energy peculiar to superior beings. Because of the kind of life he had led, and because of the resolve he had made -- and kept -- not to shrink from anything, the count had managed to enjoy unknown pleasures in the struggle against nature, which is God, and against the world -- which is, near enough, the Devil.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="伯爵的初念以为是贼党的一个诡计——是一套大骗法，要把他的注意力吸引到一个较小的危险上去，以便使他遭受一个更大的危险。他原想不顾他那位匿名朋友的劝告——或许正因为那个劝告——要把那封信送到警察总监那儿去，但转念一想，那或许真是一个只有他自己能认识的仇人，假如真是如此，那末还是他独自对付为妙。我们知道伯爵是怎样一个人；他的脑子里充满着坚强大胆的意志，他自称天下无不可能的事情，单凭那种魄力，就足以证明他和常人不同，这些都是毋庸我们再说的了。根据他过去的生活，根据他那种无所畏惧的决心，伯爵在他以往所经历的种种斗争里获得了一种难以想象的好斗的精神，有时他斗争的对象是自然，那就是上帝，有时他斗争的对象是世界，那可以说就是魔鬼。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"They don't want to steal my papers," Monte Cristo said. "They want to kill me: these are not thieves, but murderers. I do not want the prefect of police to meddle with my private affairs. Why, I am rich enough to cover the entire budget of his force."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他们不是要我的文件，”基督山说，“他们是想来杀死我。他们不是窃贼，而是刺客。我不愿意让警察总监来干涉我的私事。我很有钱，这件事情大可不必去占掉他那部门里的一部分预算经费。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The count gave instructions that he would dine alone and wished to be served only by Ali. He dined with his usual calm and sobriety and, after dinner, motioning to Ali to follow him, he left by the side-door, went to the Bois de Boulogne as though going for a walk, unobtrusively took the road for Paris and by nightfall was standing in front of his house in the Champs-Elysées. Everything was dark except for a faint light burning in the porter's lodge which, as Baptistin had said, was some forty yards from the house.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="伯爵表示他想独自进餐，只要阿里一个人侍候他。他照常以从容不迫的态度吃了饭，然后向阿里做了一个手势，叫他跟随他；他从边门出去，走到布洛涅大道，好象无意似地踏上到巴黎去的路，在黄昏时候，他发觉自己已经到了香榭丽榭大道三十号对面。他的屋子里一片漆黑，只有门房的卧室里点着一盏昏黄的孤灯，而正如培浦斯汀所说的，门房和正室之间还相隔着四十步距离。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Meanwhile Ali had laid out on a table the weapons which the count had asked for: a short carbine and a pair of double pistols with superimposed barrels that allowed the user to aim as accurately as with a target pistol. Thus armed, the count held the lives of five men in his hands.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这当儿，阿里已准备好伯爵需要的武器，——就是，一支短柄的马枪和一对象单铳手枪一样容易瞄准的双铳手枪。有了这样的武装，伯爵手里就已掌握着五个人的性命。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When he got to the bedroom, the count signalled to Ali to stop there, then went into the dressing-room, which he examined. Everything was in its usual state: the precious bureau was in its place and the key in the bureau. He double-locked it, took the key, came back to the bedroom door, removed the double tumbler on the bolt and returned.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一到他的寝室里，伯爵就示意叫阿里止步；然后他走进更衣室里，详细检查了一番。一切都照常——那张宝贵的写字台仍在原位，钥匙依旧插在抽屉上。他把抽屉结结实实地锁上，拿了钥匙，回到寝室门口，除掉门上的搭扣，走进寝室里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Monte Cristo leant against a tree and, with an eye that was rarely deceived, tested the double pathway, examined the passers-by and looked up and down the neighbouring streets, to see if anyone was waiting in ambush. After ten minutes he was convinced that no one was waiting for him. He at once ran to the little side-door with Ali, hurried in and, using his key to the back stairs, reached his bedroom without opening or stirring a single curtain, so that the concierge himself could not have guessed that the house, which he thought to be empty, was once more occupied by its principal inhabitant.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="基督山靠在一棵树上，用他那绝少错漏的眼光搜索马路，审察往来的行人，仔细探望邻近的街道，看有没有人躲在那儿。这样过了十分钟，他相信并没有人在注意他。他急忙带着阿里趋向侧门，轻捷地用钥匙打开门上的锁，挨身进去，从仆人的楼梯走上他的寝室；他不曾掀动一张窗帷，所以甚至连门房都绝未怀疑到屋主已经回来，他始终还以为是一座空屋。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Two hours passed in this way. It was completely dark, and yet, through this darkness, Ali, thanks to his savage nature, and the count, no doubt thanks to an acquired ability, could distinguish even the slightest rustle of the trees in the courtyard. The little light in the porter's lodge had long since been extinguished.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两个钟头就这样过去了。夜色非常浓黑；可是阿里和伯爵，前者由于他那野性的本质，后者无疑的得感谢他长期的狱中生活，却依旧能在黑暗中辨别出树枝的微动。门房里的那盏小灯早已熄灭了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was about half-past nine. The count and Ali quickly ate a piece of bread and drank a glass of Spanish wine. Then Monte Cristo slid back one of the moving panels that allowed him to see from one room into the next. His pistols and his carbine were within reach, and Ali, beside him, held one of those little Arab axes that have not changed in design since the Crusades. Through one of the bedroom windows, parallel to that in the dressing-room, the count could see into the street.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那时约莫是九点半钟光景。伯爵和阿里匆匆吃了一块面包，喝了一杯西班牙葡萄酒；然后基督山移开一块可移动的嵌板，由此注视隔壁房间里的情形。手枪和马枪就在他的身边，阿里站在他的附近，手里握着一把那种自十字军以来从未改变过式样的阿拉伯小斧头。从和更衣室平行的寝室的窗口里望出去，伯爵可以看到外面的街道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Presumably the attack, if one was really planned, would take place by the staircase from the ground floor and not through a window. In Monte Cristo's mind, the criminals were after his life, not his money, so they would attack the bedroom, reaching it either by the hidden staircase, or through the dressing-room window. He placed Ali in front of the door to the staircase and continued his own watch on the dressing-room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="假如真的有人要来袭击的话，那末，他们应该从下面的楼梯上来，而不会从窗口里进来。据基督山的意见，那些匪徒所要的是他的性命，而不是他的金钱。他们攻击的目标将是他的寝室，他们必须从后面的楼梯上来，或是从更衣室的窗口里进来。他让阿里守住通楼梯的那个门口，自己则继续注视更衣室。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The window that was the object of attention was opposite the opening through which the count had been staring into the dressing-room. His eyes consequently focused on this window. He could see a thicker shadow against the darkness. Then one of the panes became entirely opaque, as if a sheet of paper had been stuck on to it from outside, and the glass cracked without falling. Through the opening a hand groped for the catch. A second later the window was opening on its hinges and a man entered. The man was alone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="发出响声的那个窗口正和伯爵望入更衣室的那个洞口相对。他的眼睛一眨不眨地盯住那个洞口；他在黑暗中辨别出一个人影。然后有一格玻璃窗变成不透明的了。象是在外面粘上了一张纸似的；接着，那一方块玻璃格啦地响了一声，但并没有掉下来。一只手臂从窗洞里伸进来找搭扣。一秒钟以后，整个窗子转开来了，外面进来了一个人。他只有一个人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The count felt his heart beat faster. However much a man is inured to taking risks, however well prepared he is for danger, the fluttering of his heart and the pricking of his skin will always let him know the vast difference that lies between dream and reality, planning and execution.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="伯爵觉得他的心跳得更急促了。凡是事先知道要遭遇危险的人，当危险真正临头的时候，他们的心还是会猛跳，他们的身体还是会不由自主地颤抖，这就是梦境与现实以及计划与实行之间的大区别。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A quarter to twelve rang on the Invalides clock, the west wind carrying the dreary resonance of the three blows on its moist breath. As the last one faded, the count thought he could hear a faint noise from the dressing-room. This first sound -- to be precise, this first scraping sound -- was followed by another, then a third. At the fourth, the count knew what was going on. A firm and skilled hand was engaged in cutting the four sides of a window-pane with a diamond.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="残废军人疗养院的时钟敲打十一点三刻了；西风带来了三下凄凉的、颤抖的钟声。当最后一下钟声消逝的时候，伯爵好象觉得听到更衣室那方面发出一下轻微的响声。这是第一下响声，说得更准确些，这是一下刻划东西的声音，接着就来了第二下、第三下；当第四下响声发出的时候，伯爵知道那是怎么一回事了。一只坚定而熟练的手正在用一颗钻石刻划一格玻璃窗的四边。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When he came across to the door into the bedroom, Monte Cristo thought he was about to enter, and raised one of the pistols; but he heard simply the noise of the bolts sliding in their bronze rings. It was merely a precaution: the nocturnal visitor, not realizing the care with which the count had removed the tumblers, could now consider himself at home and in safety. Alone and free to act, the man now took something out of his pocket which the count could not make out in the darkness, put it on a small table, then went directly over to the bureau and felt around the lock, only to find that, contrary to his expectations, the key was not in place.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当他走近通寝室的那扇门的时候，基督山以为他会进来，就举起一支手枪；但他只听到门闩滑动的声音。这只是一种预防手段。那位午夜的访客因为不知道伯爵已把搭扣除掉，以为自己现在已很安全，就泰然自若地开始干起来。他从口袋里摸出一样东西，但究竟是什么东西，伯爵看不清楚，只见他把那样东西放在一张茶几上，然后笔直地立到写字台前面，去摸抽屉上的锁，而出乎他意料之外的，是钥匙竟没有在那儿。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At that moment he felt Ali touch his shoulder. He turned around. Ali was pointing to the window of the room where they were, which looked out on the street. Knowing the superb delicacy of his faithful servant's senses, Monte Cristo went across to the window and there saw another man emerging from the shelter of a doorway and climbing on a boundary stone, apparently so that he could see what was happening in the count's house. "So!" he said. "There are two of them: one to act, the other to keep watch." He motioned to Ali to keep his eyes on the man in the street and returned to the one in his dressing-room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那当儿，阿里轻轻地在他的肩胛上拍了一下。他转过头来，阿里指一指寝室向街的那个窗口。基督山向那个窗口跨近三步，他知道他这个忠仆的目光非常敏锐。的确，他又看见了一个人，那个人正从门影里走出来，爬到矮墙顶上，似乎想探望里面的情形。“好！”他说，“有两个人，一个动手，一个望风。”他向阿里做了一个手势，要他监视街上的那个人。自己则回来注意更衣室里的那一个。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But the man, in the darkness, could not find the right key; so he reached for the object which he had placed on the table, and worked a spring. At once a pale light (though bright enough to see by) cast a golden hue across the man's hands and face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但那个人在黑暗里却找不到合适的钥匙。他拿起放在茶几上的那样东西，按一按机钮，立刻就有一片仅可辨物的青白色的光反映到那个人的手和脸上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Don't move," the count whispered. "And leave your axe here, we won't need to be armed." He added a few more words in an even lower voice, because (stifled though it had been) the count's involuntary exclamation of surprise had been enough to startle the man, who had remained in the pose of the antique knife-grinder. What the count had said to Ali was an order, because he at once tiptoed away and took down a black cloak and a three-cornered hat from the wall of the alcove. Meanwhile Monte Cristo rapidly removed his frock-coat, his waistcoat and his shirt. Now, by the ray of light glowing through the hole in the panelling, you could see that the count was wearing on his chest one of those finely woven and pliable tunics of mail; in a France where people are no longer afraid of being knifed, the last person to wear one of these was probably Louis XVI, who did fear a dagger in his chest -- but died from an axe to the head.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不要动，”基督山低声说，“放下你的斧头，我们不必用武器。”然后他用更低的声音又说了几句话，因为伯爵刚才的那声惊呼虽然很轻，却已惊动了那个人，他迅速地翻出窗外，恢复了以前划玻璃时的状态。伯爵刚才所说的话是一个命令：因为阿里立刻无声地走出去，拿回来一件黑色的长袍和一顶三角帽。这当儿，基督山已经急急地脱掉他的外套、背心和衬衫，露出一件闪闪发光的柔软的钢丝背心；这种钢丝背心国王路易十六也曾穿过，只是路易十六并没有因为穿钢丝背心而保全性命，因为他最初只怕有人用匕首刺他的胸口，而结果却是他脑袋上被人砍了一斧头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But the glass-cutter was a resourceful fellow, who had made provision for every eventuality. The count soon heard the clink of iron on iron made by the rustling of that bunch of shapeless keys that locksmiths bring when you call for them to open a door, and which thieves call skeleton keys; or, if they are French thieves, rossignols, which means "nightingales", no doubt because of the pleasure they experience on listening to their nocturnal song when they grate against the bolt of a lock.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但那个划玻璃的是一个心思很周到的人，他带着各种应急的用具。伯爵不久就听到一大串钥匙的声音，就是铜匠老是放在身边准备开各种锁的那种钥匙串，这个玩意儿窃贼们称之为“夜莺”，那无疑是因为开锁的时候它会唱出玎玲当琅的夜曲的缘故。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">To his great astonishment, instead of burying itself in the count's chest, the dagger glanced off, blunted. At the same time, the count grasped the murderer's wrist in his left hand and twisted it with such force that the knife fell from his numbed fingers and Caderousse gave a cry of pain. But instead of stopping at this cry, the count continued to twist the bandit's wrist until he fell to the ground, at first on his knees, and then face downwards, his arm dislocated. The count put his foot on the man's head and said: "I don't know what is stopping me from breaking your head, scoundrel!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="使卡德罗斯万分惊奇的是：那把小刀非但没有刺进伯爵的胸口，而且反而折断刀锋倒弹了回来。这当儿，伯爵用他的左手抓住那暗杀者的手腕，用力一扭，那把小刀就从他那僵硬的手指间掉了下来。卡德罗斯发出一声痛苦的喊叫，但伯爵不管他怎么叫，继续扭那匪徒的手腕，直到他的手臂脱节，跪下来，又仰跌到地板上。伯爵于是用一只脚踏住他的头，说：“我不知道究竟是什么力量阻止我不踏破你的脑袋，你这混蛋！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"But what are you doing, father?" Caderousse said. "Suppose the watch were to go past." And he blew out the candle. Then he continued to go down the ladder, but it was not until he felt the earth of the garden under his feet that he felt truly secure.</div>

<div class="line_en">Caderousse slowly climbed the ladder and, reaching the top rungs, put his head above the parapet to make sure that the street was empty. No one was to be seen, no sound to be heard. One o'clock struck at the Invalides.</div>

<div class="line_en">Monte Cristo went back into his bedroom and glanced quickly from the garden to the street. First of all he saw Caderousse, after reaching the ground, walk around the garden and place his ladder at the far end of the wall, so as to leave by a different place from the one where he had entered. Then, looking from the garden to the street, he saw the man, who had seemed to be waiting there, run along the street on the far side of the wall and station himself at the very corner near which Caderousse was about to descend.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="基督山回到他的寝室里，急速地从花园望到街道；他先看见卡德罗斯走到花园的墙脚下，把他的梯子靠在墙上，靠梯子的地点和进来的时候不同。然后伯爵向街上望去，看见那个似乎在等待的人向同一的方向奔过来，躲在卡德罗斯就要翻出去的那个墙角里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At that, Caderousse sat astride the top of the wall and, drawing the ladder up, passed it over to the other side and prepared to go down; or, rather, to slide down the two uprights, which he did with a degree of skill that proved how accustomed he was to the operation.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是卡德罗斯骑在墙头上，把梯子抽起来，把它靠在墙外；然后他开始下去，或说得更准确些，是跨着梯子的两条直柱滑下去，这个动作他做得很安闲自在，证明他是多么的练习有素。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Caderousse, hearing the footsteps fade in the distance, lifted himself on his elbow and, making one final effort, cried faintly: "Murder! I am dying! Help me, Monsieur l'Abbé!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡德罗斯觉得凶手已经离开，就用手肘撑起身体，以一种垂死的声音竭力大喊：“杀人啦！我要死啦！救命呀，长老阁下！救命呀！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The murderer, seeing that he could no longer cry out, lifted his head by the hair. Caderousse's eyes were closed and his mouth twisted. The murderer, thinking he was dead, let his head fall back and vanished.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凶手看到他已不能叫喊，就拉住他的头发，扳起他的头；他双眼紧闭，嘴巴歪在一边。凶手以为他已经死了，就放开他的头，溜走了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">However, once he had started to let himself slide, he was unable to stop. When he was half-way down, he saw a man dash out of the shadows -- but to no avail; he saw an arm raised at the very moment he reached the ground -- but to no avail: before he could defend himself, the arm struck him so savagely in the back that he let go of the ladder and he cried out: "Help!" A second blow followed almost immediately, striking him in the side, and he fell down, crying: "Murder!" And finally, as he writhed on the ground, his adversary grasped his hair and struck him another blow on the chest. This time Caderousse tried to cry out again, but could do no more than groan: he groaned, and three streams of blood flowed from his three stab wounds.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但一开始滑下去，他就无法中途停止了。虽然他在滑到一半的时候看见有一个人从阴影里出来，却也毫无办法，虽然他在滑到下面的时候看见有一条手臂举起来，却也毫无办法。在他还无法保卫自己以前，那条手臂就已非常猛烈地打击到他的背上，他放开梯子，喊出一声“救命呀！”第二下打击几乎立刻又袭到他的胁下。他倒在地上，嘴里喊着“救命哪！杀人呀！”当他这样在地上滚来滚去的时候，他的对手抓住他的头发，在他的胸部又刺了一刀。这一次，卡德罗斯虽然竭力想叫喊，但他却只能发出一声呻吟；鲜血从他的三处伤口里津津地流出来，他全身不由自主地打着寒颤。">查看中文翻译</div>
