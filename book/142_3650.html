<div class="line_en">The day after the shooting of Don Corleone was a busy time for the Family. Michael stayed by the phone relaying messages to Sonny. Tom Hagen was busy trying to find a mediator satisfactory to both parties so that a conference could be arranged with Sollozzo. The Turk had suddenly become cagey, perhaps he knew that the Family button men of Clemenza and Tessio were ranging far and wide over the city in an attempt to pick up his trail. But Sollozzo was sticking close to his hideout, as were all top members of the Tattaglia Family. This was expected by Sonny, an elementary precaution he knew the enemy was bound to take.</div>

<div class="line_en">Clemenza was tied up with Paulie Gatto. Tessio had been given the assignment of trying to track down the whereabouts of Luca Brasi.

<div class="line_en">Mama Corleone was staying in the city with friends of the Family so that she could be near the hospital. Carlo Rizzi, the son-in-law, had offered his services but had been told to take care of his own business that Don Corleone had set him up in, a lucrative bookmaking territory in the Italian section of Manhattan. Connie was staying with her mother in town so that she too could visit her father in the hospital.</div>

<div class="line_en">Michael shrugged. He had seen soldiers in the same condition on the battlefield. But he had never expected it to happen to Freddie. He remembered the middle brother as being physically the toughest one in the family when all of them were kids. But he had also been the most obedient son to his father. And yet everyone knew that the Don had given up on this middle son ever being important to the business. He wasn't quite smart enough, and failing that, not quite ruthless enough. He was too retiring a person, did not have enough force.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈克尔耸耸肩。他当年在战场上也曾经看到有些士兵吓成了那个样子，但是他从来也没有料到弗烈特也会那样。他记得他们小的时候，老二要算家中身体最结实的一个，而且在父亲跟前也是最孝顺的儿子。尽管如此，大家都知道老头子对这个老二早就有点放弃，认为他不配在家族中承担重任。他心眼不够多，此外，心肠也不够狠。他是个过分与世无争的人物，没有足够的魄力。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Freddie was still under sedation in his own room of his parents' house. Sonny and Michael had paid him a visit and had been astonished at his paleness, his obvious illness. "Christ," Sonny said to Michael when they left Freddie's room, "he looks like he got plugged worse than the old man."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="弗烈特仍然躺在他的房间里，靠服镇静剂维持。桑儿和迈克尔曾经探望过他，看到他苍白的面容，明显的病态，大为吃惊。“基督啊！”从弗烈特的房间出来之后，桑儿对迈克尔说：“他看上去好像比老头子受到的打击还要严重。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Late in the afternoon, Michael got a call from Johnny Fontane in Hollywood. Sonny took the phone. "Nah, Johnny, no use coming back here to see the old man. He's too sick and it would give you a lot of bad publicity, and I know the old man wouldn't like that. Wait until he's better and we can move him home, then come see him. OK, I'll give him your regards." Sonny hung up the phone. He turned to Michael and said. "That'll make Pop happy, that Johnny wanted to fly from California to see how he was."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接近黄昏的时候，迈克尔接到了约翰昵·方檀从好莱坞打来的电话。桑儿接过话筒，说：“不，约翰昵，目前甭来看老头子。他病情太严重了。你要是来的话，那会搞得满城风雨，对你不利，我知道老头子是不会赞成的。等着吧，等他有所好转，我们可以把他接回家的时候，再来看望他吧。就这样，我负责向他转达你的心意。”桑儿挂上电话，回头对迈克尔说：“爸爸一听会高兴起来的，约翰昵·方檀想从加利福尼亚乘飞机来看他。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"He'll be OK," Michael said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他会好的，”迈克尔说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Michael laughed. She had remembered him telling her how important it was to do such things if you wanted to get along with the old Italians. "This is a special case," he said. "If the newspaper guys get ahold of your name and background you'll be on page three of the Daily News. Girl from old Yankee family mixed up with son of big Mafia chief. How would your parents like that?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈克尔笑起来。她记得他曾告诉她：如果你想要同老脑筋的意大利人相处下去的话，就应该懂得男女关系必须慎重的重要性。“这是特殊事故，”他说，“要是记者知道了你的姓名和背景，那你就会上报，会给登在《每日新闻》第三版：老式新英格兰家庭出身的姑娘竟同大黑帮头目的儿子勾勾搭搭。你爸爸妈妈看到这样的报导会高兴吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mike laughed again. "I'm known as the sissy of the Corleone family. No threat. So they don't have to bother coming after me. No, it's all over, Kay, there won't be any more trouble. It was all sort of an accident anyway. I'll explain when I see you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈克尔又放声笑了。“在考利昂家中，我是个出名的像大姑娘一样柔弱的男小子，不会威胁到我头上。要对付我，人家还嫌麻烦，人家不愿意在我身上浪费时间。现在已经风平浪静了，恺，不会再出什么问题了。整个过程纯属偶然，下次见面时再详谈。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Hagen said quietly, "Sollozzo wasn't worried about Luca, which struck me as funny. He's too smart not to worry about a guy like Luca. I think he maybe got him out of the picture, one way or the other."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="黑根沉着地说：“索洛佐不担心路加，这使我感到蹊跷。索洛佐为人诡诈，对路加这样的人物不会不提防。我想他可能用什么办法使路加在当前的斗争中置之度外了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sonny muttered, "Christ, I hope Luca isn't fighting against us. That's the one thing I'd be afraid of. Clemenza, Tessio, how do you two guys figure it?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Clemenza said slowly, "Anybody could go wrong, look at Paulie. But with Luca, he was a man who could only go one way. The Godfather was the only thing he believed in, the only man he feared. But not only that, Sonny, he respected your father as no one else respected him and the Godfather has earned respect from everyone. No, Luca would never betray us. And I find it hard to believe that a man like Sollozzo, no matter how cunning, could surprise Luca. He was a man who suspected everyone and everything. He was always ready for the worst. I think maybe he just went off someplace for a few days. We'll be hearing from him anytime now."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克莱门扎慢吞吞地说：“任何人都可能误入歧途，鲍里就是个例子。但是，说到路加，他这个人只能沿着一条路走下去，教父是他唯一信仰的神明，唯一敬畏的圣哲。不仅如此，桑儿你要明白，你爸爸以教父身份赢得了大家的尊敬，可是路加对你爸爸的尊敬超过了所有的人。不会，路加绝不会背叛我们。而我感到难以相信的是，像索洛佐那号人，尽管他狡猾，竟然能够突袭路加而一举成功。路加警惕性高，对任何人和任何事他都存有戒心。他时时刻刻都作好最坏的准备。我想他很可能是到什么地方去了，要耽搁几天。我们现在随时都可能听到他的消息。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sonny turned to Tessio. The Brooklyn caporegime shrugged. "Any man can turn traitor. Luca was very touchy. Maybe the Don offended him some way. That could be. I think though that Sollozzo gave him a little surprise. That fits in with what the Consigliere says. We should expect the worst."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="桑儿回头瞅瞅忒希奥。这位兵团司令耸耸肩。“任何人都可能叛变。路加这人感情容易冲动，也许是老头子惹恼了他，这是可能的。我想，从表面上看，索洛佐虽然对他来了个小小的突袭，他也可能感到正中下怀，甘当俘虏。这种分析就同参谋的说法吻合起来了。咱们思想上得作最坏的准备。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sonny said sharply, "That wasn't luck. Sollozzo was planning that for weeks. They must have tailed the old man to his office every day and watched his routine. Then they bought Paulie off and maybe Luca. They snatched Tom right on the button. They did everything they wanted to do. They were unlucky, not lucky. Those button men they hired weren't good enough and the old man moved too quick. If they had killed him, I would have had to make a deal and Sollozzo would have won. For now. I would have waited maybe and got him five, ten years from now. But don't call him lucky, Pete, that's underrating him. And we've done that too much lately."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="桑儿果断地说：“那不是侥幸。索洛佐事前策划好几个星期了。老头子上班，人家肯定每天都在跟踪着他，注视着他的日常活动，然后再把鲍里收买过去，接着也许把路加也收买了。在节骨眼上，又把汤姆抓去。人家事前要做的一切都做好了。应该说，他们是不幸的，他们雇来的那几个枪手不中用；老头子反应太迅速，他们倒有点措手不及。假使他们把他打死了，那我就迫不得已，只好作交易，索洛佐也就胜利了。目前，我就要等着瞧，也许要等五年，十年，才能把他抓到手。但是，别说他侥幸，彼得，那样说就等于低估了他。而近来，咱们吃亏就在于过分低估他。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sonny said reluctantly, "Yeah, I thought of that and the only thing I can figure is Luca. The word is already out that he's to be brought here before he's allowed any of his old rights in the Family. The only other thing I can think of is that Sollozzo has made his deal with the Families in New York and we'll get the word tomorrow that they will be against us in a war. That we'll have to give the Turk his deal. Right, Tom?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="桑儿勉强地说：“是呀，我原来也想到这一点，我可以推断的也只限于路加。话已经放出去了，说是一见到他就把他押到这儿来，至于他在家族中所享受的特权暂且可以放到一边去。另外，我还想到的就是，索洛佐同纽约几家大家族已经做好交易。我们明天就会得到通知，说什么一旦爆发战争，他们几家都要反对咱家。这样看来，我们不得不同意‘土耳其人’提出的交易。对吗，汤姆？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tessio didn't think that the loss of Paulie Gatto would upset Sollozzo, in fact he thought that the Turk might have anticipated it, indeed might have welcomed it.

<div class="line_cn" title="忒希奥认为，失去鲍里·嘎吐不会使索洛佐心神不安；另一方面他倒认为，“土耳其人”也许早就料到了这一着，而实际上喜欢这一着。从饷金名单上除掉了一个凭嘴巴提供情报而现在已经无用的人员。对这他根本不会感到吃惊。然而他们面临的形势真如忒希奥分析的那样吗？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Michael spoke up diffidently. "I know I'm an amateur in this, but from everything you guys have said about Sollozzo, plus the fact that all of a sudden he's out of touch with Tom, I'd guess he has an ace up his sleeve.

<div class="line_cn" title="迈克尔开腔了，发表了不同的见解。“我知道在这一方面我是个门外汉，但是，从你们大家对索洛佐所作的分析来看，加上他同汤姆突然中断联系这一点，我推测他可能另有诡计。他很可能突然来一手真正厉害的，那他就又会占上风。要是咱们能够推断出他的鬼花样是什么，那我们就会居于主动，扭转全局。”">查看中文翻译</div>
