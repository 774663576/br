<div class="line_en">There was more slamming in the kitchen -- and then gunshots. Eleanor knew they were gunshots, even though she'd never heard any before.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="又有人摔厨房门，然后是枪声。埃莉诺虽然从未听过枪响，但她知道那就是枪声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Gang members, she thought. Drug dealers. Rapists. Gang members who were also drug-dealing rapists. She could imagine a thousand heinous people who might have some bone to pick out of Richie's skull -- even his friends were scary.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="是帮派分子，毒贩，强奸犯。或者又贩毒又强奸的帮派分子。最起码有上千个恐怖人物跟雷奇有过节，想要崩了他的脑袋，就连他的朋友看起来都很恐怖。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was a terrible thing to admit. But sometimes Eleanor slept right through the yelling.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她实在羞于承认。不过，有时尖叫呐喊也吵不醒埃莉诺。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sometimes Maisie would wake her up, crawling into the top bunk. Maisie wouldn't let Eleanor see her cry during the day, but she shook like a little baby and sucked her thumb at night. All five of them had learned to cry without making any noise. "It's okay," Eleanor would say, hugging her. "It's okay."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有时梅西会吵醒她，他会爬到上铺。白天，梅西绝不会让埃莉诺看见她掉泪，但是晚上她会像个小婴儿一样瑟瑟发抖，吸吮起手指。他们五个都学会了不哭出声。埃莉诺会搂住梅西说：“没关系，没事的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She must have started to get out of bed as soon as she heard the gunshots. She was already on the bottom bunk, crawling over Maisie. "Don't move," she whispered, not sure whether Maisie was awake.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她应该是一听到枪声就马上爬下床的，因为她已经在下铺，弯身对梅西低声说：“别动。”她不确定梅西醒了没有。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Eleanor opened the window just enough to fit through. There wasn't any screen. She climbed out and ran as lightly as she could off the porch. She stopped at the house next door -- an old guy named Gil lived there. He wore suspenders with T-shirts and gave them dirty looks when he was sweeping his sidewalk.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃莉诺把窗户打开一点点，刚好够她侧身出去。她家的窗子没有纱窗。她爬出后，轻手轻脚地小跑过门廊，跑到邻居家。那家主人是吉尔老先生，总是穿T恤配背带裤，每次清扫人行道时，都会轻蔑望着埃莉诺他们。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Hi," she said weakly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她软弱地说：“你好。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He looked mean and mad as spit. Gil could dirty-look Tina right under the table, and then he'd probably kick her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔看起来凶恶又愤怒。他的眼神非常凶狠，好像能瞪死人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What?" Gil barked. His hair was oiled down, and he even wore suspenders with his pajamas.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔咆哮着：“什么？”他抹了发油，睡衣还配着背带裤。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Can I use your phone?" she asked. "I need to call the police."</div>

<div class="line_en">Gil took forever to answer the door, and when he did, Eleanor realized she'd used up all her adrenaline knocking.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔过了好久才应门，他打开门时，埃莉诺才发现，敲门已经用光她的肾上腺素。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I need to call 911," she said. She sounded like she was trying to borrow a cup of sugar. "Or maybe you could call 911 for me? There are men in my house with… guns. Please."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她说：“我得报警。”她的语气好像是来跟他借糖的。她说：“或者你可以帮我打911？有几个男人闯入了我家，还带了枪…求你了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="警察根本没下车，其中一个问：“是你打的电话？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">With me, Eleanor thought. She wasn't going back in there at all. What was she going to say to the Hells Angels in her living room?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="跟我？埃莉诺根本不打算回去。她要跟客厅里的那些飞车党说什么？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Gil didn't seem impressed, but he let her in. His house was really nice inside. She wondered if he used to have a wife -- or if he just really liked ruffles. The phone was in the kitchen. "I think there are men in my house," Eleanor told the 911 operator. "I heard gunshots."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔不为所动，但还是让她进了门。他的家真不错。埃莉诺不知道他以前有没有老婆，为什么会这么爱发脾气。电话在厨房。埃莉诺对接线员说：“我们家闯进一群男人，我听到了枪声。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Gil didn't tell her to leave, so she waited for the police in his kitchen. He had a whole pan of brownies on the counter, but he didn't offer her any. His refrigerator was covered with magnets shaped like states, and he had an egg timer that looked like a chicken. He sat at the kitchen table and lit a cigarette. He didn't offer her one of those either.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔没叫她离开，所以她待在厨房等警察来。他的料理台摆了一大盘布朗尼蛋糕，但没请她吃。冰箱上贴满各州形状的冰箱贴，他还有一个小鸡造型的煮蛋定时器。他坐在厨房桌旁点烟，也没请她抽。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When the police pulled up, Eleanor walked out of the house, feeling silly suddenly about her bare feet. Gil shut the door behind her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="警车停在吉尔家旁边，埃莉诺连忙走出去，突然觉得自己赤着脚很可笑，吉尔在她身后关上门。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The next time Eleanor called 911, she was going to request cops who wouldn't send her alone into an occupied building. Did firemen do this, too? Hey, kid, you go in first and unlock the door.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I can't. It's locked."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没办法，锁上了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"In bed," her mom said, helping Eleanor up the ladder to her bunk. Then her mom leaned in close, her mouth touching Eleanor's ear. "It was Richie," she whispered.

No more tonight. Not a breath."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“上床去，”她妈妈把埃莉诺推上床铺的梯子，然后靠近，贴着埃莉诺的耳朵说，“那是雷奇开的枪。有几个小孩在公园打篮球，太吵了…他只想吓唬他们。但是他的枪没有执照，屋子里还有其他东西。他很可能被捕。今晚到此为止，不准再说话。”">查看中文翻译</div>
