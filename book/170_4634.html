<div class="line_en">She boasted sixty oars, a single sail, and a long lean hull that promised speed. Small, but she might serve, Quentyn thought when he saw her, but that was before he went aboard and got a good whiff of her. Pigs, was his first thought, but after a second sniff he changed his mind. Pigs had a cleaner smell. This stink was piss and rotting meat and night-soil, this was the reek of corpse flesh and weeping sores and wounds gone bad, so strong that it overwhelmed the salt air and fish smell of the harbor.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I want to retch," he said to Gerris Drinkwater. They were waiting for the ship's master to appear, sweltering in the heat as the stench wafted up from the deck beneath them.</div>

<div class="line_en">Quentyn was about to suggest that they try another ship when the master finally made his appearance, with two vile-looking crewmen at his side. Gerris greeted him with a smile. Though he did not speak the Volantene tongue as well as Quentyn, their ruse required that he speak for them. Back in the Planky Town Quentyn had played the wineseller, but the mummery had chafed at him, so when the Dornishmen changed ships at Lys they had changed roles as well. Aboard the Meadowlark, Cletus Yronwood became the merchant, Quentyn the servant; in Volantis, with Cletus slain, Gerris had assumed the master's role.</div>

<div class="line_en">Tall and fair, with blue-green eyes, sandy hair streaked by the sun, and a lean and comely body, Gerris Drinkwater had a swagger to him, a confidence bordering on arrogance. He never seemed ill at ease, and even when he did not speak the language, he had ways of making himself understood. Quentyn cut a poor figure by comparison -- short-legged and stocky, thickly built, with hair the brown of new-turned earth. His forehead was too high, his jaw too square, his nose too broad. A good honest face, a girl had called it once, but you should smile more.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="高大而白皙，蓝绿色的眼睛，浅棕色的头发被阳光照得闪亮，精干而英俊的身体，格里斯·酌水大摇大摆地走向他，带着近乎傲慢的自信。他从来不会显得拘束，即使他不会讲这种语言时，他也有办法让自己被人理解。昆廷比起来就要差了一截——短腿而粗壮，新翻泥土似的棕色的头发。他额头太高了，他的下巴太方，他的鼻子太宽。一张善良诚实的脸，一位女孩曾经这样说它，但你应该多微笑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">That gave the captain pause. "I am no stranger to Meereen. I could find the city again, aye… but why? There are no slaves to be had in Meereen, no profit to be found there. The silver queen has put an end to that. She has even closed the fighting pits, so a poor sailor cannot even amuse himself as he waits to fill his holds.

<div class="line_en">Gerris answered with the tale they had concocted. "Wine is our family trade. My father owns extensive vineyards back in Dorne, and wishes me to find new markets. It is hoped that the good folk of Meereen will welcome what I sell."</div>

<div class="line_en">Close enough, thought Quentyn. The Volantenes were fond of boasting that the hundred isles of Braavos could be dropped into their deep harbor and drowned. Quentyn had never seen Braavos, but he could believe it. Rich and ripe and rotted, Volantis covered the mouth of the Rhoyne like a warm wet kiss, stretching across hill and marsh on both sides of the river. Ships were everywhere, coming down the river or headed out to sea, crowding the wharves and piers, taking on cargo or off-loading it: warships and whalers and trading galleys, carracks and skiffs, cogs, great cogs, long-ships, swan ships, ships from Lys and Tyrosh and Pentos, Qartheen spicers big as palaces, ships from Tolos and Yunkai and the Basilisks. So many that Quentyn, seeing the port for the first time from the deck of the Meadowlark, had told his friends that they would only linger here three days.</div>

<div class="line_en">Quentyn had begun to think that they might have done better to buy their own ship in the Planky Town. That would have drawn unwanted attention, however. The Spider had informers everywhere, even in the halls of Sunspear. "Dorne will bleed if your purpose is discovered," his father had warned him, as they watched the children frolic in the pools and fountains of the Water Gardens. "What we do is treason, make no mistake. Trust only your companions, and do your best to avoid attracting notice."</div>

<div class="line_en">Only the captain of the Fawn had given them reasons for his refusal. "It is true that I am sailing east," he told them, over watered wine. "South around Valyria and thence into the sunrise. We will take on water and provisions at New Ghis, then bend all oars toward Qarth and the Jade Gates. Every voyage has perils, long ones more than most. Why should I seek out more danger by turning into Slaver's Bay? The Fawn is my livelihood. I will not risk her to take three mad Dornishmen into the middle of a war."</div>

<div class="line_en">"This is a sweet city," Quentyn agreed. Sweet enough to rot your teeth. Sweet beets were grown in profusion hereabouts, and were served with almost every meal. The Volantenes made a cold soup of them, as thick and rich as purple honey. Their wines were sweet as well. "I fear our happy voyage will be short, however. That sweet man does not mean to take us to Meereen. He was too quick to accept your offer. He'll take thrice the usual fee, no doubt, and once he has us aboard and out of sight of land, he'll slit our throats and take the rest of our gold as well."</div>

<div class="line_en">Quentyn would have preferred to walk, but they were miles from their inn. Besides, the innkeep at the Merchant's House had warned him that traveling afoot would taint them in the eyes of foreign captains and the native-born Volantenes alike. Persons of quality traveled by palanquin, or in the back of a hathay… and as it happened the innkeep had a cousin who owned several such contrivances and would be pleased to serve them in this matter.</div>

<div class="line_en">Their driver awaited them beside his hathay. In Westeros, it might have been called an oxcart, though it was a deal more ornate than any cart that Quentyn had ever seen in Dorne, and lacked an ox.

<div class="line_en">Their driver was one of the cousin's slaves, a small man with a wheel tattooed upon one cheek, naked but for a breechclout and a pair of sandals.

The crew had beaten them off, at the cost of twelve lives. Afterward the sailors stripped the dead corsairs of boots and belts and weapons, divvied up their purses, and yanked gemstones from their ears and rings from their fingers.

<div class="line_en">Their own dead received more tender treatment. The sailors sewed their bodies up in canvas, weighed down with ballast stones so they might sink more quickly. The captain of the Meadowlark led his crew in a prayer for the souls of their slain shipmates. Then he turned to his Dornish passengers, the three who still remained of the six who had come aboard at the Planky Town. Even the big man had emerged, pale and greensick and unsteady on his feet, struggling up from the depths of the ship's hold to pay his last respects. "One of you should say some words for your dead, before we give them to the sea," the captain said.

For children, you need to lift some skirts." Later, in the Planky Town, the Dornishmen had toasted Quentyn's future bride, made ribald japes about his wedding night to come, and talked about the things they'd see, the deeds they'd do, the glory they would win.

<div class="line_cn" title="离鱼贩广场和旅店不远，从一个十字路口冒出了喧哗声，十来个无垢者的长矛手身穿华丽的盔甲和虎皮披风不知从哪儿冒了出来，挥手令众人让到一边，以便祭司乘坐的大象可以通过。祭司的大象是一个灰色皮肤的庞然大物，覆盖着精致的上釉的盔甲，随着他的移动发出轻柔的哗啦声，它背上的象楼如此高大，以至于在从装饰性的石头拱门下面经过时，它刮到了拱门的顶部。“祭司被认为如此尊贵，以至于在他们任职的一年间不容许他们的脚接触到地面。”昆廷告诉他的同伴。“他们乘坐大象前往各处。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The fishmongers were out in strength, crying the morning catch. Quentyn understood one word in two at best, but he did not need to know the words to know the fish. He saw cod and sailfish and sardines, barrels of mussels and clams. Eels hung along the front of one stall. Another displayed a gigantic turtle, strung up by its legs on iron chains, heavy as a horse. Crabs scrabbled inside casks of brine and seaweed. Several of the vendors were frying chunks of fish with onions and beets, or selling peppery fish stew out of small iron kettles.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the center of the square, under the cracked and headless statue of a dead triarch, a crowd had begun to gather about some dwarfs putting on a show. The little men were done up in wooden armor, miniature knights preparing for a joust. Quentyn saw one mount a dog, as the other hopped onto a pig… only to slide right off again, to a smattering of laughter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在广场的中心，一座已经开裂了无头的某位故去的祭司雕像下，一群人聚集起来观看一些侏儒的表演。小人儿穿上了木制盔甲，小型的骑士预备骑马用长矛比武。昆廷看到一位骑上了一条狗，同时另一位跳上了一头猪…不料又从右边滑落下来，带来了少许笑声。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The paving stones felt warm beneath his feet when Quentyn climbed down from the hathay, even through the leather of his boots. Outside the Merchant's House a trestle table had been set up in the shade and decorated with striped blue-and-white pennons that fluttered at every breath of air. Four hard-eyed sellswords lounged around the table, calling out to every passing man and boy. Windblown, Quentyn knew. The serjeants were looking for fresh meat to fill their ranks before they sailed for Slaver's Bay. And every man who signs with them is another sword for Yunkai, another blade meant to drink the blood of my bride-to-be.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当昆廷从篷车上下来时，就算隔着皮靴他也能感受到脚下的石板的热度。一张桌子支在旅馆外面的阴影处，装饰着蓝白条纹的燕尾旗，随风而摆。四名眼光严厉的佣兵懒散地围坐在这张桌子旁，向每一个经过的男人和男孩大声喊叫。狂风团，昆廷知道。这些士官在他们去往奴隶湾之前在寻找新人来补充他们的兵员。每一个和他们签下合约的人，都是一把为渊凯战斗的剑，对我未来的新娘而言，都意味着一把饮血的刀刃。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One of the Windblown shouted at them. "I do not speak your tongue," Quentyn answered. Though he could read and write High Valyrian, he had little practice speaking it. And the Volantene apple had rolled a fair distance from the Valyrian tree.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="狂风团中的一位冲他们大喊。“我不会说你们的话，”昆廷回答道。尽管他能读和写高等瓦雷利亚语，但他很少练习讲它。而且瓦兰提斯的方言瓦雷利亚语也相差得很远了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="两位雇佣兵开始唱歌，吼出某支进行曲的歌词。昆廷能听出个大概。我们就是狂风团，他们唱。向东吹向奴隶湾，杀掉屠夫国王呀，再把真龙女王干。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The big man was waiting in their rooms on the second floor. Though the inn had come well recommended by the master of the Meadowlark, that did not mean Quentyn was willing to leave their goods and gold unguarded.

<div class="line_cn" title="大人物在二楼他们的房间里等着。尽管客栈由野云雀号的船主推荐来的，这并不意味着昆廷放心让他们的货物和黄金无人看管。每个港口都有小偷，密探，和妓女，而瓦兰提斯格外的多。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I was about to go out looking for you," Ser Archibald Yronwood said as he slid the bar back to admit them. It was his cousin Cletus who had started calling him the big man, but the name was well deserved. Arch was six-and-a-half-feet tall, broad of shoulder, huge of belly, with legs like tree trunks, hands the size of hams, and no neck to speak of. Some childhood malady had made all his hair fall out. His bald head reminded Quentyn of a smooth pink boulder. "So," he demanded, "what did the smuggler say? Do we have a boat?"</div>
