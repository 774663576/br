<div class="line_en">The night was very black, in spite of the Christmas lights on some of the lampposts. She looked at Richard's face in the flare of his match. The smooth slab of his forehead overhung his narrowed eyes, strong looking as a whale's front, she thought, strong enough to batter something in. His face was like a face sculpted in wood, planed smooth and unadorned. She saw his eyes open like unexpected spots of blue sky in the darkness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尽管灯柱上还亮着圣诞节灯，今夜依旧漆黑。从他点烟的火柴亮光里，她看着理查德的脸庞。他光滑的额头悬在狭长的眼睛上，她想，他强韧的外表就像鲸鱼的额头，坚硬到足以捣碎任何东西。他的脸就像一张用木头雕刻成的脸孔一样，刨得很光滑，没有任何修饰。她看到他张开的眼睛，就像黑暗天空里令人意想不到的光点。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Richard was standing on the street corner, waiting for her, shifting from, foot to foot in the cold. She wasn't cold at all tonight, she realized suddenly, even though other people on the streets were hunched in their overcoats. She took Richard's arm and squeezed it affectionately tight.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I got our reservations today," Richard said. "The President Taylor sailing March seventh. I talked with the ticket fellow, and I think he can get us outside rooms, if I keep after him."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我今天订好了船票，”理查德说，“泰勒总统号，三月七号启航。我和卖票的人谈过了，如果我继续跟他保持联络，他可以帮我们安排一间靠外面有窗户的房间。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They began to walk. The gallery was just beside them, a row of lighted windows, each with a Christmas wreath, on the second floor of the big building. Tomorrow she would see Carol, Therese thought, tomorrow morning at eleven. She would see her only ten blocks from here, in a little more than twelve hours. She started to take Richard's arm again, and suddenly felt self-conscious about it. Eastward, down Forty-third Street, she saw Orion exactly spread in the center of the sky between the buildings. She had used to look at him from windows in school, from the window of her first New York apartment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们往前走，画廊就在旁边，有一排透着亮光的窗子，每个窗口都挂着圣诞节装饰花圈。特芮丝想，明天就可以见到卡罗尔了，早上十一点，再过十二小时多一点，她会在距离这里只有十条街的地方看到她。她又挽起了理查德的手，突然意识到自己正挽着理查德的手。往东边看去，在第四十三街上，她看到猎户星座就于天空的正中央，位于建筑物之间。她以前老是从学校的窗户往外看猎户星座，刚搬来纽约的时候，也会从自己租的公寓里往外看。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我真希望我们能共用。”理查德说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Richard swung her hand as they walked. As if they were lovers, Therese thought. It would be almost like love, what she felt for Carol, except that Carol was a woman. It was not quite insanity, but it was certainly blissful. A silly word, but how could she possibly be happier than she was now, and had been since Thursday?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们一边散步，理查德一边摇着她的手。特芮丝想，这样好像两人是恋人一样。她对卡罗尔的感觉，几乎就像是爱情一样，除了卡罗尔是女人。也许不是痴狂，但绝对会带来极大的喜悦。这个字眼很傻，但她怎么可能比现在更快乐？从礼拜四开始就这么快乐。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They got into the show at half price on Richard's art school passes. The gallery was a series of high- ceilinged, plush carpeted rooms, a background of financial opulence for the commercial advertisements, the drawings, lithographs, illustrations, or whatever that hung in a crowded row on the walls. Richard pored over some of them for minutes at a time, but Therese found them a little depressing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们用理查德的艺术学校学生证半价看了一场展览。画廊由好几个铺着厚绒布地毯的挑高房间组成，展示雄厚财力的商业广告、绘画、平面海报、插画，还有那些拥挤在墙上挂成一列的东西。有些作品会让理查德凝视好几分钟，但特芮丝认为这些作品实在有点令人沮丧。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Share a room!" Richard boomed out, laughing, and Therese noticed the two people on the sidewalk who turned to look at them. "Should we have a drink somewhere just to celebrate? We can go in the Mansfield around the corner."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“共用一间房间！”理查德一边大叫着一边笑，特芮丝注意到人行道上有些人回过头来看着他们。“我们是不是应该去哪里喝一杯庆祝一下？我们去转角的曼斯菲尔德。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Did you see this?" Richard asked, pointing to a complicated drawing of a lineman repairing a telephone wire that Therese had seen somewhere before, that tonight actually pained her to look at.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你看到了吗？”理查德问。他指着一幅构图繁复的画，画中是一个架线工人在修理电话线。特芮丝以前在别的地方看过这件作品了，今天晚上看着这幅画，真的让她很痛苦。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Richard took her arm. "You haven't enough respect for technique, little girl."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="理查德挽着她的手。“你好像不太尊重技巧，小女孩。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She gave him a mocking frown, and took his arm again. She felt very close to him suddenly, as warm and happy with him as she had been the first night she met him, at the party down on Christopher Street where Frances Cotter had taken her. Richard had been a little drunk, as he had never been since with her, talking about books and politics and people more positively than she had ever heard him talk since, too. He had talked with her all evening, and she had liked him so very much that night for his enthusiasms, his ambitions, his likes and dislikes, and because it was her first real party and he had made it a success for her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她对他皱了皱眉，好像在嘲弄他似的，然后又挽起他的手。顷刻间，她觉得两人距离非常接近，现在和他在一起会让她感到温暖快乐，就像他俩初次见面那晚一样。他们在克里斯多福街上举行的宴会上认识的，那次是弗兰西斯·科特带她去的。两人认识以后，理查德就不曾喝醉过，但第一次见面的那晩理查德喝得微醺，不断针对书籍、政治和一些人物发表他的高见。当时他的这些话，也比后来两人认识后他的言谈来得积极正面。他那晚只和她聊天，她也因为他的热情、抱负、他的喜恶而对他产生好感，当然也因为那是她第一次真正参加派对，而他为她带来了圆满的结果。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes," she said. She was thinking of something else. If she stopped scrimping to save money for Europe -- which had been silly anyway because she wasn't going -- she could buy a new coat. There would be sales right after Christmas. The coat she had now was a kind of black polo coat, and she always felt drab in it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“看到了。”她说。她在想其他事情。如果她不用为了欧洲之旅存钱（存钱这个动作看来很愚蠢，反正她是不会去欧洲的），就可以在圣诞节之后的特卖会上买件新外套。她现在穿的这件黑色的运动外套，令她老觉得自己了无生气。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Outside, Fifth Avenue seemed empty and waiting, like a stage set for some dramatic action. Therese walked along-quickly beside Richard, her hands in her pockets. Somewhere today she had lost her gloves. She was thinking of tomorrow, at eleven o'clock. She wondered if she would possibly still be with Carol this time tomorrow night.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在外面，第五大道空荡荡的，像个舞台场景在等待好戏上场。特芮丝在理查德旁边走得很快，双手插在口袋里。她今天搞丢了手套。她想着明天的七点钟。她想知道明晚这个时候有没有可能还跟卡罗尔在一起。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Therese hesitated, remembering. She had visited the Semcos four or five Sunday afternoons. They had a big dinner around two o'clock, and then Mr. Semco, a short man with a bald head, would want to dance with her to polkas and Russian folk music on the phonograph.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特芮丝迟疑了起来，她想起来了。有好几个礼拜天的下午，她曾经前去拜访桑姆科一家人，下午两点左右吃着丰富的餐点，然后矮小秃头的桑姆科先生会在留声机播放的波尔卡舞曲和俄罗斯民族音乐伴奏下，邀她共舞。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Near the door, they met some people Richard knew from the League, a young man, a girl, and a young colored man. Richard introduced Therese to them. She could tell they were not close friends of Richard's, but he announced to all of them. "We're going to Europe in March." And they all looked envious.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们在出口处碰到一些理查德俱乐部里的朋友，其中有个年轻男人、一个女孩和一个年轻的黑人。理查德把特芮丝介绍给他们，她可以感觉得出来他们和理查德并不太熟，但他还是告诉他们：“我们三月就要去欧洲了。”他们看起来一脸羡慕的样子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“做连衣裙——那太费工夫了。”特芮丝可以想象桑姆科太太绣着花纹的上衣，白色的上衣上布满一排又一排的针织线纹。桑姆科太太对她的针线功夫感到很骄傲。特芮丝则认为自己不应该接受这么费工夫的礼物。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She had known from his first step toward her that he was going to ask her that. Now she felt miserable and ashamed, sorry for herself and for him, because it was so impossible, and so embarrassing because she didn't want it. There was always that tremendous block of not even wanting to try it, which reduced it all to a kind of wretched embarrassment and nothing more, each time he asked her. She remembered the first night she had let him stay, and she writhed again inwardly. It had been anything but pleasant, and she had asked right in the middle of it, "Is this right?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从他走向她的第一步开始，她就知道他会说这种话。现在她觉得又悲哀又羞愧，替自己，也替他觉得可悲。因为她真的不爱他，她也觉得很尴尬，因为她并不想要让事情走到这个地步。每次他问起这个话题的时候，总是会有那么一个巨大的障碍横阻于前，因为她连试都不想试。最后，他的询问只会造成痛苦的尴尬。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No," Therese said, finding her voice at last. "I just can't tonight, and I can't go to Europe with you either," she finished with an abject and hopeless frankness.</div>

<div class="line_en">Richard's lips parted in a stunned way. Therese could not bear to look at the frown above them. "Why not?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="理查德的双唇因为惊讶而张开。特芮丝不敢看他脸上的不悦之情。“为什么？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Because. Because I can't," she said, every word agony. "Because I don't want to sleep with you."</div>

<div class="line_en">How could it be right and so unpleasant, she had thought. And Richard had laughed, long and loud and with a heartiness that had made her angry. And the second time had been even worse, probably because Richard had thought all the difficulties had been gotten over. It was painful enough to make her weep, and Richard had been very apologetic and had said she made him feel like a brute. And then she had protested that he wasn't. She knew very well that he wasn't, that he was angelic compared to what Angelo Rossi would have been, for instance, if she had slept with him the night he stood here on the same steps, asking the same question.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她想起了第一次让他留下来过夜的情形，内心再度纠结起来。那次的经验非常不愉快，做到一半的时候她就问他：“这样子对吗？”她当时想，如果动作没错的话，怎么可能还是让人这么不舒服。接着理查德大笑起来，笑得又久又大声，真心的大笑，让她生气。第二次甚至更糟，原因可能是理查德以为她应该已经克服了障碍，没想到整个过程太痛苦，害她哭了起来。理查德也因此感到深深的愧疚，一直说她让他觉得自己像禽兽一样，她则说他不是禽兽。她很清楚他不是禽兽，至少和安杰洛·罗西相比，理查德简直就是天使。安杰洛曾站在同样的阶梯上，同样问她两人是否可以共度一晚。如果当晚她和他上床，他的表现绝对和理查德不一样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No," Richard said with a soft laugh that shamed her all the more for its tolerance and its understanding. "No, I'll go on. Good night, honey. I love you, Terry." And with a last look at her, he went.</div>

<div class="line_en">Therese looked away, noticed Orion again, tipped at a slightly different angle, and looked back at Richard. But I can't, she thought. I've got to think about it sometime, because you think about it. It seemed to her that she spoke the words and that they were solid as blocks of wood in the air between them, even though she heard nothing. She had said the words before to him, in her room upstairs, once in Prospect Park when she was winding a kite string. But he wouldn't consider them, and what could she do now, repeat them? "Do you want to come up for a while anyway?" she asked, tortured by herself, by a shame she could not really account for.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特芮丝把头转开，又看到了猎户座，倾斜的角度稍微有点不同。然后她回头看着理查德。她想，我就是不能，我必须好好想一想，因为你已经在想这个问题了。对她来说，话已经说出来了，即使她自己什么也没听到，这些话依旧像横阻在两人之间的大木块一样坚硬。她以前在楼上的房间就对他说过同样的话，有次在公园里卷风筝线时她又说过一次。但他未曾好好思考过那些话。难道现在她能做的，就只是重复那些话？“你想要上来待一会儿吗？”她问他。她在折磨自己，一种她无法确切解释的羞愧也在折磨着她。">查看中文翻译</div>
