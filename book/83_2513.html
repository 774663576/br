<div class="line_en">A moon half gone from the full glowed through a ring of mist among the high branches of the eucalyptus trees on Laverne Terrace. A radio sounded loudly from a house low down the hill. The boy swung the car over to the box hedge in front of Geiger's house, killed the motor and sat looking straight before him with both hands on the wheel. No light showed through Geiger's hedge.</div>

<div class="line_en">He stooped for it like a flash. There was nothing slow about his movements. I sank a fist in the side of his neck. He toppled over sideways, clawing for the gun and not reaching it. I picked it up again and threw it in the car. The boy came up on all fours, leering with his eyes too wide open. He coughed and shook his head.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他以迅雷不及掩耳之势弯腰去捡枪。他的动作从头到尾都很迅速。我一拳打在他的脖子侧面。他倒向一边，伸手抓枪却没够着。我重新拿起枪，扔进车里。那小伙子四肢撑地站起来，夸张地睁大眼睛斜睨着我。他咳嗽了几声，摇摇脑袋。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I still held his automatic more or less pointed at him, but he swung on me just the same. It caught me flush on the chin. I backstepped fast enough to keep from falling, but I took plenty of the punch. It was meant to be a hard one, but a pansy has no iron in his bones, whatever he looks like.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="怎么说我还用那把自动手枪指着他呢，他照样挥拳朝我砸来。那一拳正中我的下巴。我赶紧后退，总算没跌倒，但这一击我挨得很准。他是想狠狠给我一下的，但相公都是软骨头，不管看起来有多凶悍。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I threw the gun down at the kid's feet and said: "Maybe you need this."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我把枪往那孩子脚边一扔，说道：“也许你需要这个。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You don't want to fight," I told him. "You're giving away too much weight."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你该不是想打架吧，”我对他说，“你减肥减得过头了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He wanted to fight. He shot at me like a plane from a catapult, reaching for my knees in a diving tackle. I sidestepped and reached for his neck and took it into chancery. He scraped the dirt hard and got his feet under him enough to use his hands on me where it hurt. I twisted him around and heaved him a little higher. I took hold of my right wrist with my left hand and turned my right hipbone into him and for a moment it was a balance of weights. We seemed to hang there in the misty moonlight, two grotesque creatures whose feet scraped on the road and whose breath panted with effort.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可他就是想打架。他像一架脱离弹射器的飞机般突向我，俯身朝我的膝盖擒抱过来。我横跨几步，伸手抓他的脖子，顺势夹住他的头。他的脚在泥地上拼命蹭着，勉强站住不倒，用手够我，哪儿容易疼就往哪儿打。我把他翻了个身，再举高了一点。我左手握紧右手手腕，用右边的髋骨使劲顶他，有那么片刻，我俩势均力敌。在朦胧的月光下，我俩好似僵在那儿，俨然两头奇形怪状的生物，脚刮蹭着地面，费劲地喘着大气。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He was still out when I got back. I unlocked the door, dragged him into the house, shut the door. He was beginning to gasp now. I switched a lamp on. His eyes fluttered open and focused on me slowly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我回来时他还在昏迷中。我打开门，把他拖进屋里，关上门。这时他开始喘气了。我开了一盏灯。他颤抖着眼皮睁开眼睛，渐渐看清楚了我。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I bent down, keeping out of the way of his knees and said: "Keep quiet or you'll get the same and more of it. Just lie quiet and hold your breath. Hold it until you can't hold it any longer and then tell yourself that you have to breathe, that you're black in the face, that your eyeballs are popping out, and that you're going to breathe right now, but that you're sitting strapped in the chair in the clean little gas chamber up in San Quentin and when you take that breath you're fighting with all your soul not to take it, it won't be air you'll get, it will be cyanide fumes. And that's what they call humane execution in our state now."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我俯下身，有意避开他膝盖的攻击范围，说：“保持安静，不然再给你吃刚才的苦头，这次下手会更重。静静躺着，憋住呼吸。憋到你再也憋不住，然后告诉自己不呼吸要没命了，你脸色发黑，眼珠子都突出来了，你立马需要吸气，但你正被绑在椅子上，在圣昆廷那间干净整洁的小毒气室里，你一吸气，就非得拼了命地不去吸，你吸进去的不是空气，而是氰化物。如今我们国家就管这叫做安乐死。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I had my right forearm against his windpipe now and all the strength of both arms in it. His feet began a frenetic shuffle and he wasn't panting any more. He was ironbound. His left foot sprawled off to one side and the knee went slack. I held on half a minute longer. He sagged on my arm, an enormous weight I could hardly hold up. Then I let go. He sprawled at my feet, out cold. I went to the car and got a pair of handcuffs out of the glove compartment and twisted his wrists behind him and snapped them on. I lifted him by the armpits and managed to drag him in behind the hedge, out of sight from the street. I went back to the car and moved it a hundred feet up the hill and locked it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这会儿，我用右前臂压着他的气管，加上了两条胳膊的力量。他的脚狂躁地在地上拖着，他不再喘气了。他被制服了。他的左脚向一边懒懒地伸开，膝盖绵软无力。我又坚持了半分钟。他瘫在我的手臂上，重得要命，差点叫我托不住。随后我松手了。他躺倒在我的脚边，昏了过去。我去车上的储物箱里拿了一副手铐，扭过他的手腕压在他背后，“喀嚓”铐上。我拎着他的腋窝把他抬了起来，费力地拖着他走到树障后面，避开街上的视线。我回到车上，往山上开了一百英尺，锁好了车。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">His mouth twitched. I left him lying on the floor with his wrists shackled behind him and his cheek pressed into the rug and an animal brightness in his visible eye. I put on another lamp and stepped into the hallway at the back of the living room. Geiger's bedroom didn't seem to have been touched. I opened the door, not locked now, of the bedroom across the hall from it. There was a dim flickering light in the room and a smell of sandalwood. Two cones of incense ash stood side by side on a small brass tray on the bureau. The light came from the two tall black candles in the foot-high candlesticks. They were standing on straight-backed chairs, one on either side of the bed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他嘴巴抽搐了两下。我任由他躺在地上，手腕靠在身后，脸颊陷进地毯里，露在外面的那只眼睛里透着动物般的机敏。我点亮了另一盏灯，迈进起居室后面的走廊。盖革的卧室好像原封不动。走廊对面的那间卧室这时已经不上锁了。我打开房门。房间里摇曳着昏暗的灯光，有檀木香味。梳妆台上并排立着两根锥形的香灰。光线来自一英尺高的烛架上两根细长的黑色蜡烛。它们立在直背椅子上，床的两头各有一根。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Geiger lay on the bed. The two missing strips of Chinese tapestry made a St. Andrew's Cross over the middle of his body, hiding the blood-smeared front of his Chinese coat. Below the cross his black-pajama'd legs lay stiff and straight. His feet were in the slippers with thick white felt soles. Above the cross his arms were crossed at the wrists and his hands lay flat against his shoulders, palms down, fingers close together and stretched out evenly. His mouth was closed and his Charlie Chan moustache was as unreal as a toupee. His broad nose was pinched and white. His eyes were almost closed, but not entirely. The faint glitter of his glass eye caught the light and winked at me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="盖革躺在床上。之前发现不见的两条中式挂毯搭在他的身体中央，组成一个X形十字架[1]，刚好挡住了他血迹斑斑的外套前襟。十字架下方，他黑色睡裤里的腿僵硬地挺直着。他脚上穿着厚毛毡鞋底的拖鞋。十字架上方，他的手臂在手腕处交叉，手掌平放在肩膀上，掌心向下，手指并拢，平直地伸展着。他嘴巴闭着，那两道陈查理式的八字须不真实得像假发。他的眼睛几乎闭上了，可又没有完全闭紧。那只玻璃眼珠映着烛光，发出淡淡的光泽，朝我闪烁着。【注：[1]原文作“St. Andrew’s Cross”。圣安德鲁是耶稣十二使徒之一，据传被钉死在X形十字架上，故以其命名。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I didn't touch him. I didn't go very near him. He would be as cold as ice and as stiff as a board.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我没碰他。我也不靠近他。他肯定像冰一样冷，像木板一样僵硬。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The black candles guttered in the draft from the open door. Drops of black wax crawled down their sides. The air of the room was poisonous and unreal. I went out and shut the door again and went back to the living room. The boy hadn't moved. I stood still, listening for sirens. It was all a question of how soon Agnes talked and what she said. If she talked about Geiger, the police would be there any minute. But she might not talk for hours. She might even have got away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="黑色蜡烛的蜡液从灯芯的凹口淌进了槽里。一滴一滴的黑色蜡液沿着蜡烛侧面流淌下来。房间里弥漫着的味道仿若毒气，又不太真实。我走出房间，重新关上门，回到起居室。小伙子还在地上。我静静站着，听有没有警笛声。一切都取决于艾格尼丝什么时候交代，说的是什么。如果她提及盖革，那么警察随时会来。但她也可能憋上几个小时。她甚至有可能已经跑了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He closed his eye and pretended to go to sleep. I went over to the desk and scooped up the mulberry-colored phone and dialed Bernie Ohls' office. He had left to go home at six o'clock. I dialed the number of his home. He was there.</div>
