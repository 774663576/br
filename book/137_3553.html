<div class="line_en">Now, with la Esmeralda dead, the sponge was soaked, all was at an end on this earth for Dom Claude. But to feel that she was alive, and Phoebus also, meant that tortures, shocks, alternatives, life, were beginning again. And Claude was weary of all this.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the meantime, public minor had informed the archdeacon of the miraculous manner in which the gypsy had been saved. When he learned it, he knew not what his sensations were. He had reconciled himself to la Esmeralda's death. In that matter he was tranquil; he had reached the bottom of personal suffering. The human heart (Dora Claude had meditated upon these matters) can contain only a certain quantity of despair. When the sponge is saturated, the sea may pass over it without causing a single drop more to enter it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="与此同时，群众中间的传闻使副主教直到了埃及姑娘是怎样奇迹般地被搭救了。他听说之后，心中说不出的滋味。他原已逐渐适应爱斯美腊达死了这一想法。这倒也心安理得，因为他已经到达痛苦的最大限度。人心（堂克洛德思考过这样的问题）承受伤心失意的分量总是有限的。海绵吸饱了水之后，大海尽可以从上面流过去，也无法使它多有一滴眼泪。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When he heard this news, he shut himself in his cell in the cloister. He appeared neither at the meetings of the chapter nor at the services. He closed his door against all, even against the bishop. He remained thus immured for several weeks. He was believed to be ill. And so he was, in fact.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他得悉这个消息以后，就把自己关在修士后院的斗室里。他不去参加教士会，也不去做例行圣事。谁来他都不开门，就是主教来也不开。就这样他与世隔绝一连几个星期。大家以为他病了。他也确实是病了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He passed whole days with his face close to the panes of his window. From that window, situated in the cloister, he could see la Esmeralda's chamber. He often saw herself with her goat, sometimes with Quasimodo. He remarked the little attentions of the ugly deaf man, his obedience, his delicate and submissive ways with the gypsy. He recalled, for he had a good memory, and memory is the tormentor of the jealous, he recalled the singular look of the bellringer, bent on the dancer upon a certain evening. He asked himself what motive could have impelled Quasimodo to save her. He was the witness of a thousand little scenes between the gypsy and the deaf man, the pantomime of which, viewed from afar and commented on by his passion, appeared very tender to him. He distrusted the capriciousness of women. Then he felt a jealousy which he could never have believed possible awakening within him, a jealousy which made him redden with shame and indignation: "One might condone the captain, but this one!" This thought upset him.</div>

<div class="line_en">Every night his delirious imagination represented la Esmeralda to him in all the attitudes which had caused his blood to boil most. He beheld her outstretched upon the poniarded captain, her eyes closed, her beautiful bare throat covered with Phoebus's blood, at that moment of bliss when the archdeacon had imprinted on her pale lips that kiss whose burn the unhappy girl, though half dead, had felt. He beheld her, again, stripped by the savage hands of the torturers, allowing them to bare and to enclose in the boot with its iron screw, her tiny foot, her delicate rounded leg, her white and supple knee. Again he beheld that ivory knee which alone remained outside of Torterue's horrible apparatus. Lastly, he pictured the young girl in her shift, with the rope about her neck, shoulders bare, feet bare, almost nude, as he had seen her on that last day. These images of voluptuousness made him clench his fists, and a shiver run along his spine.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="每夜，他昏昏沉沉想象着各种姿态的爱斯美腊达，都是最使他血液沸腾的。他看见她横陈在被捅了一刀的卫队长身上，双目紧闭，她那美丽的胸脯沾染着孚比斯的血，袒露着；就在那幸福的一刹那，副主教对准她那苍白的嘴唇印上一吻，不幸的姑娘虽然半死不活，却也感觉到这一吻炽热灼人。他又看见她被行刑吏粗暴的手把鞋袜扒掉，她那双小脚脚、珠圆玉润的大腿、柔软洁白的膝盖，裸露出来并被嵌入铁螺丝拧紧的脚枷。他还看见这光洁如玉的膝盖单独露在托特律残酷刑具的外面。他又想象着姑娘只穿内衣，脖子上套着绳索，双肩裸露，赤着足，几乎赤身露体，就是那最后一天他所见的形象。这种种肉感的图景刺激得他攥紧拳头，周身抖个不停。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His nights were frightful. As soon as he learned that the gypsy was alive, the cold ideas of spectre and tomb which had persecuted him for a whole day vanished, and the flesh returned to goad him. He turned and twisted on his couch at the thought that the dark-skinned maiden was so near him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="每一夜都是可怕的。自从他知道埃及姑娘还活着，前几天终日惊扰了他的种种关于幽灵和坟墓的冷彻骨髓的想法现在都已消除，肉欲又回来刺激着他。他感觉到那棕色皮肤的姑娘近在咫尺，不禁在床上扭曲着身子，辗转反侧。">查看中文翻译</div>
