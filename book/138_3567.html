<div class="line_en">The servant, Rose, remained alone in the large kitchen, where the fire was dying out on the hearth beneath the large boiler of hot water. From time to time she dipped out some water and slowly washed her dishes, stopping occasionally to look at the two streaks of light which the sun threw across the long table through the window, and which showed the defects in the glass.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="女佣，罗莎，独自待在宽大的厨房中央，伴着一点点留在壁炉中心压在那口满是热水的锅子下边的余火。她不时舀着这水，慢慢洗着她那些杯子盘子，偶尔停下来注视着那两方穿过缺少玻璃的窗子留在长桌子上的日光。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When she had finished her work, wiped down the table, dusted the mantelpiece and put the plates on the high dresser close to the wooden clock with its loud tick-tock, she drew a long breath, as she felt rather oppressed, without exactly knowing why. She looked at the black clay walls, the rafters that were blackened with smoke and from which hung spiders' webs, smoked herrings and strings of onions, and then she sat down, rather overcome by the stale odor from the earthen floor, on which so many things had been continually spilled and which the heat brought out. With this there was mingled the sour smell of the pans of milk which were set out to raise the cream in the adjoining dairy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这女佣等到做完了她这些日常工作，抹过了桌子，打扫了炉台，并且把许多盘子搁在厨房后墙边的高架子上面，架子近边是一座清脆地嘀嗒嘀嗒响着的木头挂钟；这时候她才透了一口长气，感到有点儿茫然，有点儿气闷，却不知道为着什么，她盯住那几堵发了黑的粘土墙，那些托在天花板底下发黑的椽子，和那些挂在椽子上面的蜘蛛网，黄黑色的青鱼于以及一串串的洋葱球儿；随后她坐下了，感到厨房里地上那层砸紧过的泥土里发出许多味儿教她不大舒服，因为那种泥土自从很久以前就阴干了多多少少散布在里面的东西，现在受着气温的逼迫都向外面蒸发。这种蒸发物也渗杂着那阵由隔壁屋子里新结酪皮的乳浆传出来的刺鼻气味。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The fowls were lying on the steaming dunghill; some of them were scratching with one claw in search of worms, while the cock stood up proudly in their midst. When he crowed, the cocks in all the neighboring farmyards replied to him, as if they were uttering challenges from farm to farm.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="许多母鸡在那上边侧着身子躺着打滚，用一只爪子轻轻刨着去寻觅蚁虫儿。在它们中央立着那只很健美的雄鸡，正用啼声报告自己的胜利；于是在各处天井里的所有的雄鸡答复着它，这样从一个田庄转到另一个田庄；俨然是它们互相送还这类的爱情挑战。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The girl looked at them without thinking, and then she raised her eyes and was almost dazzled at the sight of the apple trees in blossom. Just then a colt, full of life and friskiness, jumped over the ditches and then stopped suddenly, as if surprised at being alone.</div>

<div class="line_en">She also felt inclined to run; she felt inclined to move and to stretch her limbs and to repose in the warm, breathless air. She took a few undecided steps and closed her eyes, for she was seized with a feeling of animal comfort, and then she went to look for eggs in the hen loft. There were thirteen of them, which she took in and put into the storeroom; but the smell from the kitchen annoyed her again, and she went out to sit on the grass for a time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她也感到了一阵对于奔跑的羡慕，一阵运动的需要，同时，也有了一阵欲望：想躺下来，想伸开四肢，想在炎热而且静止的空气里休息。她走了几步，心里犹豫不决，闭上了眼睛，被一种兽性的舒服意味制住了；随后，她从从容容到鸡埘里去找鸡蛋。一共拾到了并且带走了13个。等到鸡蛋都在酒柜子里紧紧地搁好了的时候，厨房里的种种味儿又弄得她不舒服起来，于是她走出来到草地上边儿坐一会。">查看中文翻译</div>

Close to it, in a ditch, there was a large patch of violets, whose fragrance was spread abroad, while beyond the slope the open country could be seen, where grain was growing, with clumps of trees in places, and groups of laborers here and there, who looked as small as dolls, and white horses like toys, who were drawing a child's cart, driven by a man as tall as one's finger.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这女佣走到车房里了，那地方排着大大小小的车子。在壕堑的空儿里，有一个碧绿的满种着香气四散的紫罗兰的大坑，她从斜坡上望见了田野，一片广阔的大平原，其中全长着收获物，间或还有成簇的树，并且，这儿那儿，许许多多在远处的干活的，真小得像是泥人儿，许许多多白马俨然是一些玩具，正拖着一架被一个指头儿样大小的泥娃娃赶着的小而又小的犁头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She took up a bundle of straw, threw it into the ditch and sat down upon it. Then, not feeling comfortable, she undid it, spread it out and lay down upon it at full length on her back, with both arms under her head and her legs stretched out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她到一个阁楼里搬了一捆麦秸，把它扔在那坑里，自己再在上面坐下来，随后，感到还不十分自如，又解开了捆麦秸的绳子，铺好了场子，自己仰着躺下来，双手垫在脑袋下边，又腿伸得直挺挺的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The farmyard, which was surrounded by trees, seemed to be asleep. The tall grass, amid which the tall yellow dandelions rose up like streaks of yellow light, was of a vivid, fresh spring green. The apple trees cast their shade all round them, and the thatched roofs, on which grew blue and yellow irises, with their sword-like leaves, steamed as if the moisture of the stables and barns were coming through the straw.</div>

<div class="line_en">Gradually her eyes closed, and she was falling into a state of delightful languor. She was, in fact, almost asleep when she felt two hands on her bosom, and she sprang up at a bound. It was Jacques, one of the farm laborers, a tall fellow from Picardy, who had been making love to her for a long time. He had been herding the sheep, and, seeing her lying down in the shade, had come up stealthily and holding his breath, with glistening eyes and bits of straw in his hair.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="慢慢儿，她闭上眼睛了，在一阵甜美的柔软意境里打着瞌睡。直到竟要完全睡着了的时候，她觉得有两只手抱着自己的胸部，于是蹦地一下跳起来了。这是雅格，田庄里的打杂男工，一个身体矫健的比卡尔狄州的人，自从新近不久，他极力逢迎罗莎。这一天，他在绵羊棚子里做工，看见了她躺在有遮荫的处所，于是提着轻轻的步儿掩过来，屏住呼吸，张开眼睛，头发里边儿还粘着些儿碎的麦秸。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He tried to kiss her, but she gave him a smack in the face, for she was as strong as he, and he was shrewd enough to beg her pardon; so they sat down side by side and talked amicably. They spoke about the favorable weather, of their master, who was a good fellow, then of their neighbors, of all the people in the country round, of themselves, of their village, of their youthful days, of their recollections, of their relations, who had left them for a long time, and it might be forever. She grew sad as she thought of it, while he, with one fixed idea in his head, drew closer to her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他试着来拥抱她了，但是她打了他一个像她身体一样结实的耳刮了；后来，他涎着脸儿求了饶。于是他俩并排地坐下来，并且友好地谈天了。他们谈到这种有利于收获物的天气，谈到趋势不错的年成，谈到他们的老板，一个直性子的人，随后又谈到邻居，谈到整个儿附近一带地方，谈到他俩自己，谈到本村，谈到他俩的幼年时代，谈到他俩的种种回忆，谈到他俩的久已离开的、也许永远离开的父母们。想到这一层，她感动了，而他呢，抱着固定的念头慢慢地移近了，靠紧她了，不住颤栗着，整个儿受了欲望的侵袭。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Suddenly, however, he seized her by the neck and kissed her again, but she struck him so violently in the face with her clenched fist that his nose began to bleed, and he got up and laid his head against the stem of a tree. When she saw that, she was sorry, and going up to him, she said: "Have I hurt you?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他呢，陡然，抱住了她的脖子，并且重新吻她；但是，她举起她那只握紧了的拳头，那样使劲地迎面打了他一下，以至于他的鼻孔里流出血来；于是他站起来把脑袋靠着一枝树。这样一来，她受到感动了，接着走近他身边问道：“这可揍得你疼？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He, however, only laughed. "No, it was a mere nothing; only she had hit him right on the middle of the nose.

<div class="line_en">When the bleeding had stopped, he proposed a walk, as he was afraid of his neighbor's heavy hand, if they remained side by side like that much longer; but she took his arm of her own accord, in the avenue, as if they had been out for an evening's walk, and said: "It is not nice of you to despise me like that, Jacques." He protested, however. No, he did not despise her. He was in love with her, that was all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到了他的血停止不流的时候，他向她提议去兜一个圈子，因为倘若他俩这样并排再坐下去，他害怕这位同坐的硬拳头。但是她自动地挽着他的胳膊了，俨然像一对未婚的人傍晚在大街上的行动一样，后来她向他说道：“对不对呀，雅格，像那样子看不起我。”他抗议了。不是，他并没有看不起她，不过他是钟情的，事情不过如此。">查看中文翻译</div>

She had fat, red cheeks, a full bust beneath her cotton jacket; thick, red lips; and her neck, which was almost bare, was covered with small beads of perspiration.

Perhaps it was from him? But, as she could not read, she sat anxious and trembling with that piece of paper, covered with ink, in her hand. After a time, however, she put it into her pocket, as she did not venture to confide her secret to any one. She often stopped in her work to look at those lines written at regular intervals, and which terminated in a signature, imagining vaguely that she would suddenly discover their meaning, until at last, as she felt half mad with impatience and anxiety, she went to the schoolmaster, who told her to sit down and read to her as follows:</div>

She was as miserly about her master's money as if it had been her own; and, by dint of making good bargains, of getting high prices for all their produce, and by baffling the peasants' tricks when they offered anything for sale, he, at last, entrusted her with buying and selling everything, with the direction of all the laborers, and with the purchase of provisions necessary for the household; so that, in a short time, she became. indispensable to him.

All her sufferings would be over in there, over forever. She no longer thought of her child; she only wanted peace, complete rest, and to sleep forever, and she got up with raised arms and took two steps forward. She was in the water up to her thighs, and she was just about to throw her self in when sharp, pricking pains in her ankles made her jump back, and she uttered a cry of despair, for, from her knees to the tips of her feet, long black leeches were sucking her lifeblood, and were swelling as they adhered to her flesh. She did not dare to touch them, and screamed with horror, so that her cries of despair attracted a peasant, who was driving along at some distance, to the spot. He pulled off the leeches one by one, applied herbs to the wounds, and drove the girl to her master's farm in his gig.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then war broke out between them; he called her names and beat her. They quarrelled all day long, and when they were in their room together at night he flung insults and obscenities at her, choking with rage, until one night, not being able to think of any means of making her suffer more he ordered her to get up and go and stand out of doors in the rain until daylight. As she did not obey him, he seized her by the neck and began to strike her in the face with his fists, but she said nothing and did not move. In his exasperation he knelt on her stomach, and with clenched teeth, and mad with rage, he began to beat her. Then in her despair she rebelled, and flinging him against the wall with a furious gesture, she sat up, and in an altered voice she hissed: "I have had a child, I have had one! I had it by Jacques; you know Jacques. He promised to marry me, but he left this neighborhood without keeping his word."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是吵闹在他俩之间爆发了。他辱骂她了，打她了。整天和她闹口舌，并且夜间到了床上，他喘着气，露出恨怒的样子，对她倾出种种侮辱和污蔑之词。末了，在某一天夜间，他为着教她熬受更多的痛苦却又再也想不出什么新花样，于是吩咐她起床走到门外的风雨里去等候天明。因为她不服从，他抓住了她的脖子，接着就举起拳头在她脸上乱揍。她什么也不说，也不动。他怒不可挡了，跳起来跪在她的肚子上；后来，再咬紧牙齿，气得发狂，在她的头上乱揍。这样一来，她在一刹那间动了最后的反抗，立即用一个愤激的动作把他扔到了墙跟前，她在床上坐起来了，随后，用那道变了音的嗓子，像吹哨子一般喊道：“我有一个孩子，我，我有一个！我从前和雅格生了一个；雅格那个人，你是知道得清清楚楚的。他本应当娶我；他却走掉了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Next, a schoolmaster unveiled mysteries and processes of love which were unknown in the country, but infallible, so he declared; but none of them had the desired effect. Then the priest advised them to make a pilgrimage to the shrine at Fecamp. Rose went with the crowd and prostrated herself in the abbey, and, mingling her prayers with the coarse desires of the peasants around her, she prayed that she might be fruitful a second time; but it was in vain, and then she thought that she was being punished for her first fault, and she was seized by terrible grief. She was wasting away with sorrow; her husband was also aging prematurely, and was wearing himself out in useless hopes.</div>
