<div class="line_en">When Sara entered the holly-hung schoolroom in the afternoon, she did so as the head of a sort of procession. Miss Minchin, in her grandest silk dress, led her by the hand. A manservant followed, carrying the box containing the Last Doll, a housemaid carried a second box, and Becky brought up the rear, carrying a third and wearing a clean apron and a new cap. Sara would have much preferred to enter in the usual way, but Miss Minchin had sent for her, and, after an interview in her private sitting room, had expressed her wishes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="下午，当大家列队进人悬挂着冬青的教室时，萨拉是领头。铭钦女士穿着自己最华丽的丝绸裙装，用手领着她。一名男仆捧着装那“最后的洋娃”的匣子跟随着，一名女仆捧着第二只礼匣，而贝基捧着第三只走在队列的最后，围着一条干净的围裙，戴着顶新帽子。萨拉宁愿像往常那样进人教室，但是铭钦女士打发人把她叫到自己的起坐间，面谈了一次，提出了她的意图。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So Sara was led grandly in and felt shy when, on her entry, the big girls stared at her and touched each other's elbows, and the little ones began to squirm joyously in their seats.</div>

<div class="line_en">Becky had quite forgotten herself in her excitement, and was grinning at Lottie, who was wriggling with rapturous expectation.

<div class="line_en">She rubbed her eyes with her handkerchief until they looked quite red. After which she got up and went out of the room, without venturing to say another word. When her older sister looked and spoke as she had done just now, the wisest course to pursue was to obey orders without any comment. Miss Minchin walked across the room. She spoke to herself aloud without knowing that she was doing it. During the last year the story of the diamond mines had suggested all sorts of possibilities to her. Even proprietors of seminaries might make fortunes in stocks, with the aid of owners of mines. And now, instead of looking forward to gains, she was left to look back upon losses.</div>

<div class="line_en">Poor Miss Amelia was accustomed to being called a goose. She knew, in fact, that she was rather a goose, and that it was left to geese to do a great many disagreeable things. It was a somewhat embarrassing thing to go into the midst of a room full of delighted children, and tell the giver of the feast that she had suddenly been transformed into a little beggar, and must go upstairs and put on an old black frock which was too small for her. But the thing must be done. This was evidently not the time when questions might be asked.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sara made two or three steps toward her. Her thin little chest heaved up and down, and she spoke in a strange un-childishly fierce way.</div>

<div class="line_en">"You are not kind," she said. "You are NOT kind, and it is NOT a home." And she had turned and run out of the room before Miss Minchin could stop her or do anything but stare after her with stony anger.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你并不慈悲。你并不慈悲，这儿也不是什么家”说完她就转身奔出房间，铭钦女士来不及叫她站住或采取什么行动，只能愤怒地瞪着她的背影。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She meant to go to her room and lie down on the tiger-skin, with her cheek upon the great cat's head, and look into the fire and think and think and think. But just before she reached the landing Miss Amelia came out of the door and closed it behind her, and stood before it, looking nervous and awkward. The truth was that she felt secretly ashamed of the thing she had been ordered to do.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Where is my room?" she asked, hoping very much that her voice did not shake.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我的房间在哪里”她问道，希望自己的声音千万不要发抖。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sara knew where it was. Becky had told her about it. She turned, and mounted up two flights of stairs. The last one was narrow, and covered with shabby strips of old carpet. She felt as if she were walking away and leaving far behind her the world in which that other child, who no longer seemed herself, had lived. This child, in her short, tight old frock, climbing the stairs to the attic, was quite a different creature.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="萨拉知道它在哪儿。贝基向她讲起过那地方。她调转方向，登上两段楼梯。后一段楼梯很窄，铺着破成一结络的旧地毯。她感到好像正从这个世界中走开，把另一个孩子生活过的世界远远抛在身后，而那另一个孩子不再是她本人了。眼前的这个孩子穿着又短又紧的旧连衣裙，正向着阁楼攀登，已完全换了一个人了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Yes, this was another world. The room had a slanting roof and was whitewashed. The whitewash was dingy and had fallen off in places. There was a rusty grate, an old iron bedstead, and a hard bed covered with a faded coverlet. Some pieces of furniture too much worn to be used downstairs had been sent up. Under the skylight in the roof, which showed nothing but an oblong piece of dull gray sky, there stood an old battered red footstool. Sara went to it and sat down. She seldom cried. She did not cry now. She laid Emily across her knees and put her face down upon her and her arms around her, and sat there, her little black head resting on the black draperies, not saying one word, not making one sound.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="是的，这是另一个世界。这房间的天花板是倾斜的，虽然涂过石灰水，但很脏，有些地方灰泥已经掉落了。有一个生了锈的壁炉，一副旧的铁床架，硬床板上铺着一条褪了色的床罩。几件家具是由于破得不堪在楼下使用才被送上来的。从屋顶天窗看出去，除了一长条暗灰色的天空外什么也看不到，而天窗下搁着一个破旧的红漆脚凳。萨拉向它走过去，坐下来。她难得哭泣。这时也没哭。她把埃米莉横放在双膝上，低头用脸偎着她，用胳膊搂着她，就这样坐着，一头黑发靠在黑色的窗帘上，一言不发，一声不吭。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When she reached the attic door and opened it, her heart gave a dreary little thump. Then she shut the door and stood against it and looked about her.</div>

<div class="line_en">And as she sat in this silence there came a low tap at the door -- such a low, humble one that she did not at first hear it, and, indeed, was not roused until the door was timidly pushed open and a poor tear-smeared face appeared peeping round it. It was Becky's face, and Becky had been crying furtively for hours and rubbing her eyes with her kitchen apron until she looked strange indeed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她这样坐着、沉浸在宁静之中时，门上传来一下轻轻的敲门声― 这样轻微恭顺的敲门声，起初她都没听到，确实要等到门被小心翼翼地推开、露出一张可怜兮兮的泪水模糊的脸在窥视着时才警觉起来。那是贝基的脸，而贝基已暗自哭了几个小时，一直用她的厨房围裙擦眼睛，弄得看上去人都变样了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Becky ran to her and caught her hand, and hugged it to her breast, kneeling beside her and sobbing with love and pain.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sara lifted her head and looked at her. She tried to begin a smile, and somehow she could not. Suddenly -- and it was all through the loving mournfulness of Becky's streaming eyes -- her face looked more like a child's not so much too old for her years. She held out her hand and gave a little sob.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="萨拉抬起头来看着她，试着笑一笑，但不知为什么竟笑不起来。突然间——这都是由于看到贝基泪眼中流露出的带着怜爱的哀伤——她的脸庞恢复了孩子气，而不再显得和她的年龄不相称了。她向贝基伸出手去，轻轻地硬咽了一声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes, miss, you are," she cried, and her words were all broken. "Whats'ever 'appens to you -- whats'ever -- you'd be a princess all the same -- an' nothin' couldn't make you nothin' different."</div>
