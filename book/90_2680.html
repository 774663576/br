<div class="line_en">We should go to the ornithologist with a new feeling, if he could teach us what the social birds say, when they sit in the autumn council, talking together in the trees. The want of sympathy makes his record a dull dictionary. His result is a dead bird. The bird is not in its ounces and inches, but in its relations to Nature; and the skin or skeleton you show me, is no more a heron, than a heap of ashes or a bottle of gases into which his body has been reduced, is Dante or Washington. The naturalist is led from the road by the whole distance of his fancied advance. The boy had juster views when he gazed at the shells on the beach, or the flowers in the meadow, unable to call them by their names, than the man in the pride of his nomenclature. Astrology interested us, for it tied man to the system. Instead of an isolated beggar, the farthest star felt him, and he felt the star. However rash and however falsified by pretenders and traders in it, the hint was true and divine, the soul's avowal of its large relations, and, that climate, century, remote natures, as well as near, are part of its biography. Chemistry takes to pieces, but it does not construct. Alchemy which sought to transmute one element into another, to prolong life, to arm with power, -- that was in the right direction. All our science lacks a human side. The tenant is more than the house. Bugs and stamens and spores, on which we lavish so many years, are not finalities, and man, when his powers unfold in order, will take Nature along with him, and emit light into all her recesses. The human heart concerns us more than the poring into microscopes, and is larger than can be measured by the pompous figures of the astronomer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果鸟类学家能够告诉我们，在树上聚集召开秋季会议的鸟儿们在说些什么的话，我们肯定会对他刮目相看的。不懂鸟语，他的记录只是枯燥的词典，研究成果也不过是只死鸟，鸟儿的研究不在于它的重量和大小，而在于它和大自然的关系。你展示给我的皮毛和骨架既不是一只鹭，也不是一堆骨灰或一瓶由其身体化成的气体，而是但丁或华盛顿。生物学家以为自己已经取得了一些进步，而正是这样使得他偏离了轨道。小孩子看见沙滩上的贝壳或草地上的花朵，虽然叫不出它们的名字，但比起那些自以为专业的人来说，他们的眼光更精准。我们对占星术感兴趣，因为它联系着人和星系。最远的星辰能够感知到隔离的乞丐，他也能感知到那颗星辰。不管骗子和商人怎样莽撞或虚伪，那暗中的联系都是真实而神圣的，灵魂坦承的其庞大的联系，气候、世纪、遥远及近处的万物都是它自身发展过程中的一部分。化学是细分成碎片，而不是组建。炼金术是把一种元素转化成另一种元素，去延续生命并拥有力量——方向正确。我们所有的科学都缺少人文的一面。房客比房子更重要。我们花费大量的时间在昆虫、雄蕊和芽孢的研究上，却无定论，可人的力量一旦被发掘出来，就会与大自然一起并进，来揭示自然界的所有秘密。我们人类心灵的作用远远胜过显微镜，大到用天文学家的庞大数据都无法衡量。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We are just so frivolous and skeptical. Men hold themselves cheap and vile: and yet a man is a fagot of thunderbolts. All the elements pour through his system: he is the flood of the flood, and fire of the fire; he feels the antipodes and the pole, as drops of his blood: they are the extension of his personality. His duties are measured by that instrument he is; and a right and perfect man would be felt to the centre of the Copernican system. 'Tis curious that we only believe as deep as we live. We do not think heroes can exert any more awful power than that surface-play which amuses us. A deep man believes in miracles, waits for them, believes in magic, believes that the orator will decompose his adversary; believes that the evil eye can wither, that the heart's blessing can heal; that love can exalt talent; can overcome all odds. From a great heart secret magnetisms flow incessantly to draw great events. But we prize very humble utilities, a prudent husband, a good son, a voter, a citizen, and deprecate any romance of character; and perhaps reckon only his money value, -- his intellect, his affection, as a sort of bill of exchange, easily convertible into fine chambers, pictures, music, and wine.</div>

<div class="line_en">The motive of science was the extension of man, on all sides, into Nature, till his hands should touch the stars, his eyes see through the earth, his ears understand the language of beast and bird, and the sense of the wind; and, through his sympathy, heaven and earth should talk with him. But that is not our science. These geologies, chemistries, astronomies, seem to make wise, but they leave us where they found us. The invention is of use to the inventor, of questionable help to any other. The formulas of science are like the papers in your pocket-book, of no value to any but the owner. Science in England, in America, is jealous of theory, hates the name of love and moral purpose. There's a revenge for this inhumanity. What manner of man does science make? The boy is not attracted. He says, I do not wish to be such a kind of man as my professor is. The collector has dried all the plants in his herbal, but he has lost weight and humor. He has got all snakes and lizards in his phials, but science has done for him also, and has put the man into a bottle. Our reliance on the physician is a kind of despair of ourselves. The clergy have bronchitis, which does not seem a certificate of spiritual health. Macready thought it came of the falsetto of their voicing. An Indian prince, Tisso, one day riding in the forest, saw a herd of elk sporting. "See how happy," he said, "these browsing elks are! Why should not priests, lodged and fed comfortably in the temples, also amuse themselves?" Returning home, he imparted this reflection to the king. The king, on the next day, conferred the sovereignty on him, saying, "Prince, administer this empire for seven days: at the termination of that period, I shall put thee to death." At the end of the seventh day, the king inquired, "From what cause hast thou become so emaciated?" He answered, "From the horror of death." The monarch rejoined: "Live, my child, and be wise. Thou hast ceased to take recreation, saying to thyself, in seven days I shall be put to death. These priests in the temple incessantly meditate on death; how can they enter into healthful diversions?" But the men of science or the doctors or the clergy are not victims of their pursuits, more than others. The miller, the lawyer, and the merchant, dedicate themselves to their own details, and do not come out men of more force. Have they divination, grand aims, hospitality of soul, and the equality to any event, which we demand in man, or only the reactions of the mill, of the wares, of the chicane?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="科学的动力就是能使人在大自然中各方面都得以发展，发展到他伸手能摘星星，双眼看穿地球，两耳破译鸟语兽言，感受到风的行踪；并且通过心灵与天地对话。但这并不是我们的科学。这些地质学、化学和天文学似乎能使我们睿智，却止步于人与它们互相发现的地方。发明只对发明家起作用，对其他人有何作用却很成问题。科学的公式就像你记事本上的纸一样，只对拥有者有价值。科学在英国在美国，都推崇理论，而不喜欢以爱或道德的名义以达到什么目的。不人道的行为会得到报应。科学造就了人怎样的风度呢？孩子对这不感兴趣，他说，我不希望成为像我老师那样的人。收藏者风干了他所有的植物标本，但自己也失去了体重和体液。他把他所有的蛇和蜥蜴都装进了药瓶里，科学也是这样回敬了他，把他装进一个瓶子。我们信赖医师是我们对自己的一种绝望。某位牧师得了支气管炎，似乎不能说明他精神是健康的。麦克里迪曾把这种症状归结为他们的发音是假声。一天，一位名叫蒂索的印度王子在森林里骑马，看到一群嬉戏的麋鹿，于是说道，“看这些鹿多快乐啊！那些僧侣们丰衣足食的，为什么却不能这样娱乐呢？”回到家，他把自己的想法告诉了国王。第二天，国王授予他君权并说，“王子，国家由你来管理七天，七天之后我就会处死你。”到了第七天晚上，国王问他，“你为什么这样憔悴？”王子回答，“因为害怕死亡。”国王说，“孩子，好好做人，当你心里总想着七天后会被处死时，就不会再顾及娱乐了。庙里的僧人整天思考死亡的问题，他们怎么会有心思去消遣呢？”但是科学家、医生或是牧师跟其他行业的人一样，都受到自己事的戕害。磨坊主、律师和商人把自己全部的精力都投入到琐事中，到头来却没有变成更有力量的人。他们是否又拥有预测能力、伟大目标、热忱之心和处事公正，这些我们对人的要求呢？还是只对石磨、商品和诡辩感兴趣呢？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So inveterate is our habit of criticism, that much of our knowledge in this direction belongs to the chapter of pathology. The crowd in the street oftener furnishes degradations than angels or redeemers: but they all prove the transparency. Every spirit makes its house; and we can give a shrewd guess from the house to the inhabitant. But not less does Nature furnish us with every sign of grace and goodness. The delicious faces of children, the beauty of school-girls, "the sweet seriousness of sixteen," the lofty air of well-born, well-bred boys, the passionate histories in the looks and manners of youth and early manhood, and the varied power in all that well-known company that escort us through life, -- we know how these forms thrill, paralyze, provoke, inspire, and enlarge us.</div>

<div class="line_en">No object really interests us but man, and in man only his superiorities; and, though we are aware of a perfect law in Nature, it has fascination for us only through its relation to him, or, as it is rooted in the mind. At the birth of Winckelmann, more than a hundred years ago, side by side with this arid, departmental, postmortem science, rose an enthusiasm in the study of Beauty; and perhaps some sparks from it may yet light a conflagration in the other. Knowledge of men, knowledge of manners, the power of form, and our sensibility to personal influence, never go out of fashion. These are facts of a science which we study without book, whose teachers and subjects are always near us.</div>

<div class="line_en">The ancients believed that a genius or demon took possession at birth of each mortal, to guide him; that these genii were sometimes seen as a flame of fire partly immersed in the bodies which they governed; -- on an evil man, resting on his head; in a good man, mixed with his substance. They thought the same genius, at the death of its ward, entered a new-born child, and they pretended to guess the pilot, by the sailing of the ship. We recognize obscurely the same fact, though we give it our own names. We say, that every man is entitled to be valued by his best moment. We measure our friends so. We know, they have intervals of folly, whereof we take no heed, but wait the reappearings of the genius, which are sure and beautiful. On the other side, everybody knows people who appear beridden, and who, with all degrees of ability, never impress us with the air of free agency. They know it too, and peep with their eyes to see if you detect their sad plight. We fancy, could we pronounce the solving word, and disenchant them, the cloud would roll up, the little rider would be discovered and unseated, and they would regain their freedom. The remedy seems never to be far off, since the first step into thought lifts this mountain of necessity. Thought is the pent air-ball which can rive the planet, and the beauty which certain objects have for him, is the friendly fire which expands the thought, and acquaints the prisoner that liberty and power await him.</div>

<div class="line_en">The question of Beauty takes us out of surfaces, to thinking of the foundations of things. Goethe said, "The beautiful is a manifestation of secret laws of Nature, which, but for this appearance, had been forever concealed from us." And the working of this deep instinct makes all the excitement -- much of it superficial and absurd enough -- about works of art, which leads armies of vain travellers every year to Italy, Greece, and Egypt. Every man values every acquisition he makes in the science of beauty, above his possessions. The most useful man in the most useful world, so long as only commodity was served, would remain unsatisfied. But, as fast as he sees beauty, life acquires a very high value.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="美让我们透过表面，去思考事物的本质。歌德说过：“美的事物是神秘自然法则的外显，若不是此种表现，我们便永远不可能发现美的存在。”正是这种深层的本质特征，激发了所有对艺术品——常常流于浅薄和荒谬——的兴奋感，这种感觉引导着一大批的虚伪旅行者每年去游览意大利、希腊和埃及。每个人都珍惜自己在美这一科学中的任何收获，甚至超过了对自己财产的珍惜。实用至上的世界，最讲求实用的人，对他们来说，如果仅仅提供给他商品，是无法使他满足的。但是，在他目睹美的那一瞬间，生命便获得了更高的价值。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I am warned by the ill fate of many philosophers not to attempt a definition of Beauty. I will rather enumerate a few of its qualities. We ascribe beauty to that which is simple; which has no superfluous parts; which exactly answers its end; which stands related to all things; which is the mean of many extremes. It is the most enduring quality, and the most ascending quality. We say, love is blind, and the figure of Cupid is drawn with a bandage round his eyes. Blind: -- yes, because he does not see what he does not like; but the sharpest-sighted hunter in the universe is Love, for finding what he seeks, and only that; and the mythologists tell us, that Vulcan was painted lame, and Cupid blind, to call attention to the fact, that one was all limbs, and the other, all eyes. In the true mythology, Love is an immortal child, and Beauty leads him as a guide: nor can we express a deeper sense than when we say, Beauty is the pilot of the young soul.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="很多哲学家的悲惨命运告诫我们，不要试图给美下定义。我宁可列举出它的一些特点。趋于简朴的事物，我们称它为美的。它没有拖沓冗长，总是恰如其分地达到目的。它与世界万物紧密相连，是许多极端的平衡。它具有永恒和高尚的特性。人们常说，爱情是盲目的，就连丘比特的画像中他的双眼也被蒙蔽。盲目——是的，这样他就看不到他所不愿看到的东西。然而，人世间目光最为犀利的猎手还是爱情，它能找到自己所想要的，仅此而已。神话研究者告诉我们，锻造之神伏尔甘被描绘成一个瘸子，爱神丘比特被描绘成一个盲人，是为了让人们知道这样一个事实：前者其实是四肢健全的，后者其实是能洞察一切的。而在真正的神话中，爱情是一个永恒的孩子，美是他的引导者。我们总是用这样一句话来表达这种深刻的含义，即，美是年轻心灵的舵手。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Beyond their sensuous delight, the forms and colors of Nature have a new charm for us in our perception, that not one ornament was added for ornament, but is a sign of some better health, or more excellent action. Elegance of form in bird or beast, or in the human figure, marks some excellence of structure: or beauty is only an invitation from what belongs to us. 'Tis a law of botany, that in plants, the same virtues follow the same forms. It is a rule of largest application, true in a plant, true in a loaf of bread, that in the construction of any fabric or organism, any real increase of fitness to its end, is an increase of beauty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大自然的各种形态和色彩，不仅能带给我们美感和愉悦之情，还另有一种迷人的魅力。它能给自然界增添一种美的装饰，但那绝不是流于表面的装饰，而是一种更加健康、更加出色的装点。鸟兽外形或人类形体的优美，代表了某种组织结构的优美。或者说，美不过是一种源于我们自身的感染力。植物学中有这样一条规则，相同的功效遵循相同的外形。那么对于任何一种有机结构来说，越是符合自身的目的，它的美感就越强。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The lesson taught by the study of Greek and of Gothic art, of antique and of Pre-Raphaelite painting, was worth all the research, -- namely, that all beauty must be organic; that outside embellishment is deformity. It is the soundness of the bones that ultimates itself in a peach-bloom complexion: health of constitution that makes the sparkle and the power of the eye. 'Tis the adjustment of the size and of the joining of the sockets of the skeleton, that gives grace of outline and the finer grace of movement. The cat and the deer cannot move or sit inelegantly. The dancing-master can never teach a badly built man to walk well. The tint of the flower proceeds from its root, and the lustres of the sea-shell begin with its existence. Hence our taste in building rejects paint, and all shifts, and shows the original grain of the wood: refuses pilasters and columns that support nothing, and allows the real supporters of the house honestly to show themselves. Every necessary or organic action pleases the beholder. A man leading a horse to water, a farmer sowing seed, the labors of haymakers in the field, the carpenter building a ship, the smith at his forge, or, whatever useful labor, is becoming to the wise eye. But if it is done to be seen, it is mean. How beautiful are ships on the sea! but ships in the theatre, -- or ships kept for picturesque effect on Virginia Water, by George IV, and men hired to stand in fitting costumes at a penny an hour! -- What a difference in effect between a battalion of troops marching to action, and one of our independent companies on a holiday! In the midst of a military show, and a festal procession gay with banners, I saw a boy seize an old tin pan that lay rusting under a wall, and poising it on the top of a stick, he set it turning, and made it describe the most elegant imaginable curves, and drew away attention from the decorated procession by this startling beauty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="通过对希腊、哥特式艺术，以及古代和前拉菲尔派画作的研究表明，所有美的形式必须是有机组成的，外在的修饰不过是一种扭曲。正是由于骨骼的完美，才显现出了肤色的润红，体格的强健才使得双目炯炯有神。正是这些骨骼和谐的有机组成，才造就了优雅的举止和美丽的外表，就像猫和鹿的行动和姿态必定是优雅的。即便是舞蹈大师也不可能教会形体难看的人跳出优美的舞姿。花朵的色彩源自其根茎，海贝的光泽与生俱来。所以，我们对建筑物的鉴赏，不会去评价油漆，不会去在乎其建造方法，不必去展现木头本来的纹理；拒绝任何没有真正支撑作用的壁柱和圆柱，而赞成真实地表现房屋的支柱。每个必要的、系统的行为都能带给观众快乐。饮马、播种、田间劳作、木匠造船、铁匠打铁，或者任何辛勤的劳动，所有这些，在智者眼中都是和谐的。然而，如果只是做秀，就会显得虚伪。大海上的船只多美啊！而剧场里的船呢——即乔治四世为增添弗吉尼亚海域的风景而摆放在那里的船，再加上一小时一便士雇来的人在那里着装把守；那步伐整齐走向战场的士兵，和节日里游行的独立方阵相比起来，全然不是一回事啊！一场隆重的阅兵仪式正在举行，我看到一个孩子在墙角抓起一只锈迹斑斑的平底锅，并把它挂在一根棍子上，旋转起来，让它展示出各种优雅、奇异的曲线，这种美令人惊讶，赞叹，足以将人们的视线从悉心装点的队伍那里吸引过来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Another text from the mythologists. The Greeks fabled that Venus was born of the foam of the sea. Nothing interests us which is stark or bounded, but only what streams with life, what is in act or endeavor to reach somewhat beyond. The pleasure a palace or a temple gives the eye, is, that an order and method has been communicated to stones, so that they speak and geometrize, become tender or sublime with expression. Beauty is the moment of transition, as if the form were just ready to flow into other forms. Any fixedness, heaping, or concentration on one feature, -- a long nose, a sharp chin, a hump-back, -- is the reverse of the flowing, and therefore deformed. Beautiful as is the symmetry of any form, if the form can move, we seek a more excellent symmetry. The interruption of equilibrium stimulates the eye to desire the restoration of symmetry, and to watch the steps through which it is attained. This is the charm of running water, sea-waves, the flight of birds, and the locomotion of animals. This is the theory of dancing, to recover continually in changes the lost equilibrium, not by abrupt and angular, but by gradual and curving movements. I have been told by persons of experience in matters of taste, that the fashions follow a law of gradation, and are never arbitrary. The new mode is always only a step onward in the same direction as the last mode; and a cultivated eye is prepared for and predicts the new fashion. This fact suggests the reason of all mistakes and offence in our own modes. It is necessary in music, when you strike a discord, to let down the ear by an intermediate note or two to the accord again: and many a good experiment, born of good sense, and destined to succeed, fails, only because it is offensively sudden. I suppose, the Parisian milliner who dresses the world from her imperious boudoir will know how to reconcile the Bloomer costume to the eye of mankind, and make it triumphant over Punch himself, by interposing the just gradations. I need not say, how wide the same law ranges; and how much it can be hoped to effect. All that is a little harshly claimed by progressive parties, may easily come to be conceded without question, if this rule be observed. Thus the circumstances may be easily imagined, in which woman may speak, vote, argue causes, legislate, and drive a coach, and all the most naturally in the world, if only it come by degrees. To this streaming or flowing belongs the beauty that all circular movement has; as, the circulation of waters, the circulation of the blood, the periodical motion of planets, the annual wave of vegetation, the action and reaction of Nature: and, if we follow it out, this demand in our thought for an ever-onward action, is the argument for the immortality.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="神话作家还这样写道，在希腊神话中，维纳斯诞生于大海的泡沫里。任何刻板呆滞或局限的事物，都无法引起我们的兴趣，只有那种与生命一起流淌，并且是正在超越或努力超越的事物才值得我们去关注。宫殿和庙宇之所以能带给人一种愉悦，是它用石头传达了一种规则与秩序，这些石头就是用各种几何图形传达思想，从而显得精致和庄严。美是变化的瞬间，就像从一种形式转变成另外一种形式。任何凝固的堆砌或是只突出一个特征的，都是缺乏流动之美的，比如长鼻子、尖下巴、驼背等等，都是丑陋和畸形的。尽管任何形式的对称都是美的，但如果形式可以流动，或许能找到一种更为完美的对称。打破平衡，眼睛将渴望恢复对称，并渴望目睹重获平衡的每个步骤。这也正是流水、海浪、飞鸟和走兽的魅力所在。这也是舞蹈的原理所在，那就是要在变化中，通过平缓和灵活的动作而不是生硬和笨拙的动作，不断去寻求失去的平衡。很多经验丰富的人跟我讨论过关于品位的问题，他们认为时尚总是遵循着一种渐进的规律，而不是主观的臆断。新的形式是在旧的形式的某个方向上的进一步发展的结果。有品位的人就能对新的时尚有所准备，并作出预测。这一现象告诉了我们自己的行为经常出错或者引起厌恶的原因。音乐中，奏出一个不和谐的音符后就有必要用一两个中间音调和一下，使听觉更舒服些。许多根基扎实的试验，理论上本来是完全可以成功的，但却失败了，就是因为过于仓促和鲁莽。我觉得，巴黎那位女帽商人根据自己的闺房来装点生活，她一定知道让人如何去接受布鲁姆女装，并通过颜色层次变化来战胜潘楚。我不必说出同一条规律的适用范围有多广，人们对它作用的期望有多高。如果能够遵守这条规律，那么那些进步党派宣称的一切，尽管有些苛刻，也一定会被认可。这样一来，很容易就能想象出这样一些情景：只要逐步去实施，妇女在现实生活中就能理所当然地去演说、选举、辩论、立法或是驾驶。循环运动所拥有的美，都属于这种；就如水的流通，血液的循环，行星的周期性运动，植物年复一年的生长，大自然的作用与反作用亦然。而且，如果我们能够自始至终坚守同一规律，我们的思想就会不断地追求上进，这就是永恒的表现。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">One more text from the mythologists is to the same purpose, -- Beauty rides on a lion. Beauty rests on necessities. The line of beauty is the result of perfect economy. The cell of the bee is built at that angle which gives the most strength with the least wax; the bone or the quill of the bird gives the most alar strength, with the least weight. "It is the purgation of superfluities," said Michel Angelo. There is not a particle to spare in natural structures. There is a compelling reason in the uses of the plant, for every novelty of color or form: and our art saves material, by more skilful arrangement, and reaches beauty by taking every superfluous ounce that can be spared from a wall, and keeping all its strength in the poetry of columns. In rhetoric, this art of omission is a chief secret of power, and, in general, it is proof of high culture, to say the greatest matters in the simplest way.</div>

<div class="line_en">The felicities of design in art, or in works of Nature, arc shadows or forerunners of that beauty which reaches its perfection in the human form. All men are its lovers. Wherever it goes, it creates joy and hilarity, and everything is permitted to it. It reaches its height in woman. "To Eve," say the Mahometans, "God gave two thirds of all beauty." A beautiful woman is a practical poet, taming her savage mate, planting tenderness, hope, and eloquence, in all whom she approaches. Some favors of condition must go with it, since a certain serenity is essential, but we love its reproofs and superiorities. Nature wishes that woman should attract man, yet she often cunningly moulds into her face a little sarcasm, which seems to say, 'Yes, I am willing to attract, but to attract a little better kind of a man than any I yet behold.' French mémoires of the fifteenth century celebrate the name of Pauline de Viguiere, a virtuous and accomplished maiden, who so fired the enthusiasm of her contemporaries, by her enchanting form, that the citizens of her native city of Toulouse obtained the aid of the civil authorities to compel her to appear publicly on the balcony at least twice a week, and, as often as she showed herself, the crowd was dangerous to life. Not less, in England, in the last century, was the fame of the Gunnings, of whom, Elizabeth married the Duke of Hamilton; and Maria, the Earl of Coventry. Walpole says, "the concourse was so great, when the Duchess of Hamilton was presented at court, on Friday, that even the noble crowd in the drawing-room clambered on chairs and tables to look at her. There are mobs at their doors to see them get into their chairs, and people go early to get places at the theatres, when it is known they will be there." "Such crowds," he adds, elsewhere, "flock to see the Duchess of Hamilton, that seven hundred people sat up all night, in and about an inn, in Yorkshire, to sec her get into her postchaise next morning."</div>

They heal us of awkwardness by their words and looks. We observe their intellectual influence on the most serious student.

<div class="line_en">That Beauty is the normal state, is shown by the perpetual effort of Nature to attain it. Mirabeau had an ugly face on a handsome ground; and we see faces every day which have a good type, but have been marred in the casting: a proof that we are all entitled to beauty, should have been beautiful, if our ancestors had kept the laws, -- as every lily and every rose is well. But our bodies do not fit us, but caricature and satirize us. Thus, short legs, which constrain us to short, mincing steps, are a kind of personal insult and contumely to the owner; and long stilts, again, put him at perpetual disadvantage, and force him to stoop to the general level of mankind. Martial ridicules a gentleman of his day whose countenance resembled the face of a swimmer seen under water. Saadi describes a schoolmaster "so ugly and crabbed, that a sight of him would derange the ecstasies of the orthodox." Faces are rarely true to any ideal type, but are a record in sculpture of a thousand anecdotes of whim and folly. Portrait painters say that most faces and forms are irregular and unsymmetrical; have one eye blue, and one gray; the nose not straight; and one shoulder higher than another; the hair unequally distributed, etc. The man is physically as well as metaphysically a thing of shreds and patches, borrowed unequally from good and bad ancestors, and a misfit from the start.</div>

<div class="line_en">A beautiful person, among the Greeks, was thought to betray by this sign some secret favor of the immortal gods: and we can pardon pride, when a woman possesses such a figure, that wherever she stands, or moves, or leaves a shadow on the wall, or sits for a portrait to the artist, she confers a favor on the world. And yet -- it is not beauty that inspires the deepest passion. Beauty without grace is the hook without the bait. Beauty, without expression, tires. Abbé Ménage said of the President Le Bailleul, "that he was fit for nothing but to sit for his portrait." A Greek epigram intimates that the force of love is not shown by the courting of beauty, but when the like desire is inflamed for one who is ill-favored. And petulant old gentlemen, who have chanced to suffer some intolerable weariness from pretty people, or who have seen cut flowers to some profusion, or who see, after a world of pains have been successfully taken for the costume, how the least mistake in sentiment takes all the beauty out of your clothes, -- affirm, that the secret of ugliness consists not in irregularity, but in being uninteresting.</div>

<div class="line_en">We love any forms, however ugly, from which great qualities shine. If command, eloquence, art, or invention, exist in the most deformed person, all the accidents that usually displease, please, and raise esteem and wonder higher. The great orator was an emaciated, insignificant person, but he was all brain. Cardinal De Retz says of De Bouillon, "With the physiognomy of an ox, he had the perspicacity of an eagle." It was said of Hooke, the friend of Newton, "he is the most, and promises the least, of any man in England." "Since I am so ugly," said Du Guesclin, "it behooves that I be bold." Sir Philip Sidney, the darling of mankind, Ben Jonson tells us, "was no pleasant man in countenance, his face being spoiled with pimples, and of high blood, and long." Those who have ruled human destinies, like planets, for thousands of years, were not handsome men. If a man can raise a small city to be a great kingdom, can make bread cheap, can irrigate deserts, can join oceans by canals, can subdue steam, can organize victory, can lead the opinions of mankind, can enlarge knowledge, 'tis no matter whether his nose is parallel to his spine, as it ought to be, or whether he has a nose at all; whether his legs are straight, or whether his legs are amputated; his deformities will come to be reckoned ornamental, and advantageous on the whole. This is the triumph of expression, degrading beauty, charming us with a power so fine and friendly and intoxicating, that it makes admired persons insipid, and the thought of passing our lives with them insupportable. There are faces so fluid with expression, so flushed and rippled by the play of thought, that we can hardly find what the mere features really are. When the delicious beauty of lineaments loses its power, it is because a more delicious beauty has appeared; that an interior and durable form has been disclosed. Still, Beauty rides on her lion, as before. Still, "it was for beauty that the world was made." The lives of the Italian artists, who established a despotism of genius amidst the dukes and kings and mobs of their stormy epoch, prove how loyal men in all times are to a finer brain, a finer method, than their own. If a man can cut such a head on his stone gate-post as shall draw and keep a crowd about it all day, by its beauty, good nature, and inscrutable meaning; -- if a man can build a plain cottage with such symmetry, as to make all the fine palaces look cheap and vulgar; can take such advantage of Nature, that all her powers serve him; making use of geometry, instead of expense; tapping a mountain for his water-jet; causing the sun and moon to seem only the decorations of his estate; this is still the legitimate dominion of beauty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一个形体无论多么丑陋，只要它具有一种高贵的品质和高尚的情操，我们就会喜爱它。如果感召力、雄辩、艺术气质或是创造力汇集在一个相貌丑陋的人身上，那么不但所有平常看来令人不快的东西都会变得令人惬意，而且还能获得更高的尊敬和赞叹。一位杰出的演说家，尽管面容憔悴，貌不惊人，但是却充满智慧。德雷斯主教谈到德·布荣时说，“他具有一副公牛的面孔，却有着雄鹰一般敏锐的双眼。”据说牛顿的朋友胡可“是英国最丑的人，却是空许诺言最少的人”。“既然我长得太丑，”杜·盖克兰曾说，“我就应该大胆。”本·琼生告诉我们，菲利普·锡德尼爵士，这位人类的宠儿“貌不惊人，他的长脸具有高贵的血统，却长满了粉刺疙瘩。”那些像星辰一样主宰人类命运千万年的统治者们，也不见得个个都英俊潇洒。一个人如果能将一座小城治理成一个泱泱大国，能够使面包变得廉价，沙漠变成绿洲，开凿运河并连接海洋，能够成功利用蒸汽，引领人类的思维，拓展知识领域，那么即使他的鼻梁不够端正，抑或是根本没有鼻子，即使他的腿跛了，或是截了肢，这些也都不再重要了。他身上的每一个缺陷，都将被视为一种修饰，或者可以说会成为他的特点。这就是胜利的表现，它降低了美的级别，让我们陶醉于一种完美、友善和迷人的力量。这种力量使得宠儿变得平淡，使得与他们共同生活的想法不再坚定。有些面孔善于表达，思考能使其泛起红晕，荡起涟漪，这样一来，我们很难看清那些面部特征是什么样的。如果面容上的迷人美丽你已感受不到了，那是因为更为迷人的美丽已经出现；一种内在、持久的东西已经被揭示出来。还是如上所述，美要依靠勇气。还是那句话，“世界因美而存在。”意大利的艺术家们在他们疾风骤雨的时代里，在国王、公爵和普通民众当中建立起了天才的独大，他们的生活证明了，任何时代的人是多么忠于优于他们的头脑和方法。如果一个人能在自家的门前石柱上雕出一尊头像，这尊头像以它的美、它的温厚和它那深奥的含义，吸引一大堆人来围观；如果一个人能建造一间普通的农舍，以其标准的外形使得其他所有的宫殿都相形见绌；如果他能利用大自然，使其为己所用；如果他不用耗费精力，而是利用几何学知识，开发高山获取水源，使得日月仿佛也为自己所拥有，这一切都在美的领域之内。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The radiance of the human form, though sometimes astonishing, is only a burst of beauty for a few years or a few months, at the perfection of youth, and in most, rapidly declines. But we remain lovers of it, only transferring our interest to interior excellence. And it is not only admirable in singular and salient talents, but also in the world of manners. But the sovereign attribute remains to be noted. Things are pretty, graceful, rich, elegant, handsome, but, until they speak to the imagination, not yet beautiful. This is the reason why beauty is still escaping out of all analysis. It is not yet possessed, it cannot be handled. Proclus says, "it swims on the light of forms." It is properly not in the form, but in the mind. It instantly deserts possession, and flies to an object in the horizon. If I could put my hand on the north star, would it be as beautiful? The sea is lovely, but when we bathe in it, the beauty forsakes all the near water. For the imagination and senses cannot be gratified at the same time. Wordsworth rightly speaks of "a light that never was on sea or land," meaning, that it was supplied by the observer, and the Welsh bard warns his countrywomen, that -- "half of their charms with Cadwallon shall die."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="人的外貌尽管有时令人惊叹，却只是出现在短暂的青年时代，在人生的长河里不过短短几个春秋，犹如昙花一现般绚丽，而后就悄然消逝。但是我们依然有着爱美之心，不同的是把目光转向了内在美。这种美不仅在卓越的天才们身上得到显现，而且对每一个普通人来说，也是一种美的风采和气度。但是，美有一种至高特质不容忽视。可爱、高尚、端庄、优雅而又丰富的事物，不一定就是美的，一般只在想象中才是如此。这也是为什么无法辨析美的主要原因。它不为任何事物占有，也不为任何东西驾驭。普罗克勒斯说过，他游浮于浮光掠影之上。准确地说，美不在外表，而在内心。一刹那，它便摆脱了束缚，飞向天尽头的某处。假如北极星触手可及的话，难道这不是一种美吗？大海很美，而我们沐浴其中，这美便会离近旁的海水而去。因为想象与感知无法同时获得满足。华兹华斯说的不错，他提及“光绝不会滞留在海洋或是陆地上”，也就是说，光其实源自观者。威尔士的吟游诗人告诫他的妇女同胞说：跟随着卡德瓦隆，她们的美丽半数都会消逝。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The feat of the imagination is in showing the convertibility of every thing into every other thing. Facts which had never before left their stark common sense, suddenly figure as Eleusinian mysteries. My boots and chair and candlestick are fairies in disguise, meteors and constellations. All the facts in Nature are nouns of the intellect, and make the grammar of the eternal language. Every word has a double, treble, or centuple use and meaning. What! has my stove and pepper-pot a false bottom! I cry you mercy, good shoe-box! I did not know you were a jewel-case. Chaff and dust begin to sparkle, and are clothed about with immortality. And there is a joy in perceiving the representative or symbolic character of a fact, which no bare fact or event can ever give. There are no days in life so memorable as those which vibrated to some stroke of the imagination.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="想象力的功劳在于它能展现出每一种事物向另一种事物转化的可能性。某些一直固守于僵化的常识，突然之间变成了埃留西斯人神秘仪式中的一环。我的皮靴、椅子和烛台是伪装的仙子、流星和星座。大自然中的一切事物都是智慧的结晶，并且创造了不朽的语言的语法。每一个字都具有双重、三重，或是上百种的用法和含义。什么！难道我的火炉和辣椒盒都只有一个假的底座！漂亮的鞋盒啊，我大声请求你的谅解！我不知道你原本是一只珠宝盒。干草和灰尘开始闪烁出光泽，周身披上了不朽的外衣。能够感受到事物的典型特征或象征性，就能感受到一种快乐。这种快乐是任何纯粹的事实或事件都无法给予的。伴随着想象的节拍一起流动的日子，才是最值得珍藏的生命时光。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The new virtue which constitutes a thing beautiful, is a certain cosmical quality, or, a power to suggest relation to the whole world, and so lift the object out of a pitiful individuality. Every natural feature, -- sea, sky, rainbow, flowers, musical tone, -- has in it somewhat which is not private, but universal, speaks of that central benefit which is the soul of Nature, and thereby is beautiful. And, in chosen men and women, I find somewhat in form, speech, and manners, which is not of their person and family, but of a humane, catholic, and spiritual character, and we love them as the sky. They have a largeness of suggestion, and their face and manners carry a certain grandeur, like time and justice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="构成事物美的一个新的特性可以是一种普遍存在的品德，也可以是一种力量，它能够暗示事物与整个世界存在的某种联系，并将事物从一个可悲的个体中拯救出来。海洋、天空、彩虹、花朵和乐曲，每一种自然的形式都是一种普遍的某个特征，属于整个世界，而非个体。它的主要益处就是代表了自然的灵魂、核心，因此它是美的。在一些被我挑选出来的男男女女身上，我也发现了他们的言谈举止总是带有一种不属于他们个人或者家庭的东西，而是属于一种人性的、普遍的和高尚的特性。因而，我们能像爱蓝天大海一样去爱他们。他们能激发众多的联想，他们的面庞和姿态带有某种庄严的味道，一如时间与正义带给人的感觉那样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The laws of this translation we do not know, or why one feature or gesture enchants, why one word or syllable intoxicates, but the fact is familiar that the fine touch of the eye, or a grace of manners, or a phrase of poetry, plants wings at our shoulders; as if the Divinity, in his approaches, lifts away mountains of obstruction, and deigns to draw a truer line, which the mind knows and owns. This is that haughty force of beauty, "vis superba forme," which the poets praise, -- under calm and precise outline, the immeasurable and divine: Beauty hiding all wisdom and power in its calm sky.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们并不清楚这些转化的法则，不清楚为何某一种特征或姿势能吸引人，为何某一个字眼或音节能令人沉迷，而事实我们却很熟悉，即，眼神的温柔似水、优雅的举止，或是诗歌中的词语，都能为我们的心灵插上翅膀；仿佛神灵贴近我们的那一刻，它挪开了阻挡的山脉，精心勾画了一条更为真实的、只有心灵才能懂得和拥有的界限。这即是美所蕴含的崇高力量。诗人这样赞美它，“vis superba formae（这即是崇高的美）”——在这平和、精确的轮廓下，便是那无穷和神圣的东西：美蕴含了一切的智慧与力量。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The poets are quite right in decking their mistresses with the spoils of the landscape, flower-gardens, gems, rainbows, flushes of morning, and stars of night, since all beauty points at identity, and whatsoever thing does not express to me the sea and sky, day and night, is somewhat forbidden and wrong. Into every beautiful object, there enters somewhat immeasurable and divine, and just as much into form bounded by outlines, like mountains on the horizon, as into tones of music, or depths of space. Polarized light showed the secret architecture of bodies; and when the second-sight of the mind is opened, now one color or form or gesture, and now another, has a pungency, as if a more interior ray had been emitted, disclosing its deep holdings in the frame of things.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="诗人喜欢把他们的爱人比作美景、花园、宝石、彩虹、朝霞和星辰，不无道理，因为所有的美都体现出一种共性。我认为，一种东西如果无法用来比附海洋、天空、白天与黑夜，那么在某种程度上它就是不合理的，不可取了。每一个美的事物，都注入了某种神圣的、无限的东西。同样，那些轮廓勾勒出的线条，比如地平线上的山脉、音乐曲调或是浩瀚的空间，也被注入了那种东西。偏振光展示了身体构造的秘密；心灵的窗户一经打开，此时的一种颜色、一种外形，或是一种姿态，彼时便统统变成了另一种，并且格外强烈，仿佛某种更为隐秘的光线闪烁出来，都是事物的内在本质更加深刻的揭示。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">All high beauty has a moral element in it, and I find the antique sculpture as ethical as Marcus Antoninus: and the beauty ever in proportion to the depth of thought. Gross and obscure natures, however decorated, seem impure shambles; but character gives splendor to youth, and awe to wrinkled skin and gray hairs. An adorer of truth we cannot choose but obey, and the woman who has shared with us the moral sentiment, -- her locks must appear to us sublime. Thus there is a climbing scale of culture, from the first agreeable sensation which a sparkling gem or a scarlet stain affords the eye, up through fair outlines and details of the landscape, features of the human face and form, signs and tokens of thought and character in manners, up to the ineffable mysteries of the intellect. Wherever we begin, thither our steps tend: an ascent from the joy of a horse in his trappings, up to the perception of Newton, that the globe on which we ride is only a larger apple falling from a larger tree; up to the perception of Plato, that globe and universe are rude and early expressions of an all-dissolving Unity, -- the first stair on the scale to the temple of the Mind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所有崇高的美中都有一种道德元素。我发现，古代的雕刻会像马斯库·安东尼一样遵循伦理道德。这表明美和思想成正比。粗俗而卑劣的秉性，不论怎样修饰，都将是屠宰场的垃圾；而高尚的人格能赋予年轻人光彩，能给予年老者威严和庄重。我们要追求真理，我们别无选择，只能遵从。而一位道德高尚的女子，在我们看来，她的头发也会无比动人。文化的阶梯是不断向上攀升的，从一块耀眼的宝石或一片鲜艳的色彩带给我们视觉以快感的时刻起，到自然风光优美的轮廓和细节，再到人的外貌和形体特征，到行为举止的特点，到思想的标记和象征，最终到神秘的智慧之光。我们无论从何处出发，每一步都是朝着那个方向前行着。这是一个升华的过程，起初是从征服一匹骏马上感受到欣喜，而后我们得知了牛顿，了解到我们赖以生存的地球不过是从一棵更大的树上落下的、更大的一个苹果而已；到后来，我们知道了柏拉图，明白了地球和宇宙仅仅是一个包容一切的整体的最初阶段——而这一点正是通向心灵殿堂的第一个台阶。">查看中文翻译</div>
