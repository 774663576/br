<div class="line_en">Till now that she was threatened with its loss, Emma had never known how much of her happiness depended on being first with Mr. Knightley, first in interest and affection. -- Satisfied that it was so, and feeling it her due, she had enjoyed it without reflection; and only in the dread of being supplanted, found how inexpressibly important it had been. -- Long, very long, she felt she had been first; for, having no female connexions of his own, there had been only Isabella whose claims could be compared with hers, and she had always known exactly how far he loved and esteemed Isabella. She had herself been first with him for many years past. She had not deserved it; she had often been negligent or perverse, slighting his advice, or even wilfully opposing him, insensible of half his merits, and quarrelling with him because he would not acknowledge her false and insolent estimate of her own-but still, from family attachment and habit, and thorough excellence of mind, he had loved her, and watched over her from a girl, with an endeavour to improve her, and an anxiety for her doing right, which no other creature had at all shared. In spite of all her faults, she knew she was dear to him; might she not say, very dear? -- When the suggestions of hope, however, which must follow here, presented themselves, she could not presume to indulge them. Harriet Smith might think herself not unworthy of being peculiarly, exclusively, passionately loved by Mr. Knightley. She could not. She could not flatter herself with any idea of blindness in his attachment to her. She had received a very recent proof of its impartiality. -- How shocked had he been by her behaviour to Miss Bates! How directly, how strongly had he expressed himself to her on the subject! -- Not too strongly for the offence-but far, far too strongly to issue from any feeling softer than upright justice and clear-sighted goodwill. -- She had no hope, nothing to deserve the name of hope, that he could have that sort of affection for herself which was now in question; but there was a hope (at times a slight one, at times much stronger,) that Harriet might have deceived herself, and be overrating his regard for her. -- Wish it she must, for his sake-be the consequence nothing to herself, but his remaining single all his life. Could she be secure of that, indeed, of his never marrying at all, she believed she should be perfectly satisfied. -- Let him but continue the same Mr. Knightley to her and her father, the same Mr. Knightley to all the world; let Donwell and Hartfield lose none of their precious intercourse of friendship and confidence, and her peace would be fully secured. -- Marriage, in fact, would not do for her. It would be incompatible with what she owed to her father, and with what she felt for him. Nothing should separate her from her father. She would not marry, even if she were asked by Mr. Knightley.</div>

The power of observation would be soon given-frightfully soon it appeared when her thoughts were in one course. In the meanwhile, she resolved against seeing Harriet. -- It would do neither of them good, it would do the subject no good, to be talking of it farther. -- She was resolved not to be convinced, as long as she could doubt, and yet had no authority for opposing Harriet's confidence. To talk would be only to irritate. -- She wrote to her, therefore, kindly, but decisively, to beg that she would not, at present, come to Hartfield; acknowledging it to be her conviction, that all farther confidential discussion of one topic had better be avoided; and hoping, that if a few days were allowed to pass before they met again, except in the company of others-she objected only to a tete-a-tete-they might be able to act as if they had forgotten the conversation of yesterday. -- Harriet submitted, and approved, and was grateful.</div>

<div class="line_en">This point was just arranged, when a visitor arrived to tear Emma's thoughts a little from the one subject which had engrossed them, sleeping or waking, the last twenty-four hours-Mrs. Weston, who had been calling on her daughter-in-law elect, and took Hartfield in her way home, almost as much in duty to Emma as in pleasure to herself, to relate all the particulars of so interesting an interview.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这件事刚安排好，就来了一位客人，把爱玛从过去二十四小时连睡觉走路都无法释怀的那件事上分了心——这就是韦斯顿太太，她去看望未来的儿媳妇，回家时顺路来到哈特菲尔德，一方面礼节性地看看爱玛，一方面也好散散心，把这么有趣的一场会晤详详细细地讲一讲。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A little curiosity Emma had; and she made the most of it while her friend related. Mrs. Weston had set off to pay the visit in a good deal of agitation herself; and in the first place had wished not to go at all at present, to be allowed merely to write to Miss Fairfax instead, and to defer this ceremonious call till a little time had passed, and Mr. Churchill could be reconciled to the engagement's becoming known; as, considering every thing, she thought such a visit could not be paid without leading to reports: -- but Mr. Weston had thought differently; he was extremely anxious to shew his approbation to Miss Fairfax and her family, and did not conceive that any suspicion could be excited by it; or if it were, that it would be of any consequence; for "such things," he observed, "always got about." Emma smiled, and felt that Mr. Weston had very good reason for saying so. They had gone, in short-and very great had been the evident distress and confusion of the lady. She had hardly been able to speak a word, and every look and action had shewn how deeply she was suffering from consciousness. The quiet, heart-felt satisfaction of the old lady, and the rapturous delight of her daughter-who proved even too joyous to talk as usual, had been a gratifying, yet almost an affecting, scene. They were both so truly respectable in their happiness, so disinterested in every sensation; thought so much of Jane; so much of every body, and so little of themselves, that every kindly feeling was at work for them. Miss Fairfax's recent illness had offered a fair plea for Mrs. Weston to invite her to an airing; she had drawn back and declined at first, but, on being pressed had yielded; and, in the course of their drive, Mrs. Weston had, by gentle encouragement, overcome so much of her embarrassment, as to bring her to converse on the important subject. Apologies for her seemingly ungracious silence in their first reception, and the warmest expressions of the gratitude she was always feeling towards herself and Mr. Weston, must necessarily open the cause; but when these effusions were put by, they had talked a good deal of the present and of the future state of the engagement. Mrs. Weston was convinced that such conversation must be the greatest relief to her companion, pent up within her own mind as every thing had so long been, and was very much pleased with all that she had said on the subject.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱玛对这事还是有一点好奇，趁朋友述说的时候，倒是充分利用了这点好奇心。韦斯顿太太刚出门时，心里有些忐忑不安。她原先并不打算，只想给费尔法克斯小姐写封信，等过一些时候，邱吉尔先生同意把婚约公开了，再去作这次礼节性的拜访，因为考虑到方方面面的因素，她这一去势必会传得沸沸扬扬。可是，韦斯顿先生却不以为然。他急于要向费尔法克斯小姐及其家人表示认可，认为去一趟不会引起别人的猜疑，即便有人猜疑，也没有什么大不了的。他说：“这一类事总要张扬出去。”爱玛笑了，觉得韦斯顿先生这么说很有道理。总而言之，他们了——那位小姐显得极其窘迫，极为不安。她几乎一声不吭，每一个眼神、每一个举动，都流露出一副难为情的样子。老太太打心眼里感到满意，但是没有做声，她女儿则欣喜若狂——高兴得甚至都不像往常那样唠唠叨叨了，真是一个令人高兴，甚至令人感动的场面。她们两人的喜幸劲儿真令人可敬，襟怀那样坦荡无私，只想着简，想着别人，就是没想到自己，心里洋溢着种种亲切的情意。费尔法克斯小姐最近生过病，恰好为韦斯顿太太邀她出去兜风提供了借口。费尔法克斯小姐起初退退缩缩不想去，后来经不住韦斯顿太太竭力劝说，只好依从了。兜风的时候，韦斯顿太太温声细语地鼓励她，大大消除了她的局促不安，终于使她谈起了那个重大的话题。首先当然是表示歉意，说他们第一次来看她，她却沉闷不语，真是太没有礼貌了；接着便激动不已地表达了她对韦斯顿夫妇一贯的感激之情。倾诉了这些心意之后，两人谈了很多有关订婚的现状和未来。韦斯顿太太心想，她的游伴长期把苦衷埋在心里，这次跟她一交谈，一定感到如释重负，因而她对自己说的话，感到很满意。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mr. Weston had accompanied her to Mrs. Bates's, and gone through his share of this essential attention most handsomely; but she having then induced Miss Fairfax to join her in an airing, was now returned with much more to say, and much more to say with satisfaction, than a quarter of an hour spent in Mrs. Bates's parlour, with all the encumbrance of awkward feelings, could have afforded.</div>

<div class="line_en">"On the misery of what she had suffered, during the concealment of so many months," continued Mrs. Weston, "she was energetic. This was one of her expressions. `I will not say, that since I entered into the engagement I have not had some happy moments; but I can say, that I have never known the blessing of one tranquil hour:' -- and the quivering lip, Emma, which uttered it, was an attestation that I felt at my heart."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“她隐瞒了好几个月，忍受了不少的痛苦，”韦斯顿太太继续说道，“从这点看来，她还是很坚强的。她有这样一句话：‘我不能说订婚后就没有过快乐的时候，但是我敢说，我一时一刻也没安宁过。’爱玛，她说这话的时候，嘴唇都在颤抖，我从心底里相信她说的是实情。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Wrong! No one, I believe, can blame her more than she is disposed to blame herself. `The consequence,' said she, `has been a state of perpetual suffering to me; and so it ought. But after all the punishment that misconduct can bring, it is still not less misconduct. Pain is no expiation. I never can be blameless. I have been acting contrary to all my sense of right; and the fortunate turn that every thing has taken, and the kindness I am now receiving, is what my conscience tells me ought not to be.' `Do not imagine, madam,' she continued, `that I was taught wrong. Do not let any reflection fall on the principles or the care of the friends who brought me up. The error has been all my own; and I do assure you that, with all the excuse that present circumstances may appear to give, I shall yet dread making the story known to Colonel Campbell.'"</div>

<div class="line_en">"On your side, my love, it was very innocently done. But she probably had something of that in her thoughts, when alluding to the misunderstandings which he had given us hints of before. One natural consequence of the evil she had involved herself in," she said, "was that of making her unreasonable. The consciousness of having done amiss, had exposed her to a thousand inquietudes, and made her captious and irritable to a degree that must have been -- that had been-hard for him to bear. `I did not make the allowances,' said she, `which I ought to have done, for his temper and spirits -- his delightful spirits, and that gaiety, that playfulness of disposition, which, under any other circumstances, would, I am sure, have been as constantly bewitching to me, as they were at first.' She then began to speak of you, and of the great kindness you had shewn her during her illness; and with a blush which shewed me how it was all connected, desired me, whenever I had an opportunity, to thank you-I could not thank you too much-for every wish and every endeavour to do her good.

<div class="line_en">Such a conclusion could not pass unanswered by Mrs. Weston. She thought well of Frank in almost every respect; and, what was more, she loved him very much, and her defence was, therefore, earnest. She talked with a great deal of reason, and at least equal affection -- but she had too much to urge for Emma's attention; it was soon gone to Brunswick Square or to Donwell; she forgot to attempt to listen; and when Mrs. Weston ended with, "We have not yet had the letter we are so anxious for, you know, but I hope it will soon come," she was obliged to pause before she answered, and at last obliged to answer at random, before she could at all recollect what letter it was which they were so anxious for.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mrs. Weston's communications furnished Emma with more food for unpleasant reflection, by increasing her esteem and compassion, and her sense of past injustice towards Miss Fairfax. She bitterly regretted not having sought a closer acquaintance with her, and blushed for the envious feelings which had certainly been, in some measure, the cause. Had she followed Mr. Knightley's known wishes, in paying that attention to Miss Fairfax, which was every way her due; had she tried to know her better; had she done her part towards intimacy; had she endeavoured to find a friend there instead of in Harriet Smith; she must, in all probability, have been spared from every pain which pressed on her now. -- Birth, abilities, and education, had been equally marking one as an associate for her, to be received with gratitude; and the other-what was she? -- Supposing even that they had never become intimate friends; that she had never been admitted into Miss Fairfax's confidence on this important matter -- which was most probable-still, in knowing her as she ought, and as she might, she must have been preserved from the abominable suspicions of an improper attachment to Mr. Dixon, which she had not only so foolishly fashioned and harboured herself, but had so unpardonably imparted; an idea which she greatly feared had been made a subject of material distress to the delicacy of Jane's feelings, by the levity or carelessness of Frank Churchill's. Of all the sources of evil surrounding the former, since her coming to Highbury, she was persuaded that she must herself have been the worst. She must have been a perpetual enemy. They never could have been all three together, without her having stabbed Jane Fairfax's peace in a thousand instances; and on Box Hill, perhaps, it had been the agony of a mind that would bear no more.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="听了韦斯顿太太说的情况，爱玛越发敬重和同情费尔法克斯小姐，越发感到以前对不起她，因而心里越想越难过。她悔不该没跟她再亲近一些，为自己的嫉妒心理感到脸红，正是这嫉妒心理，在一定程度上妨碍了她们的亲近。想当初，她要是听了奈特利先生的话，注意关心费尔法克斯小姐（不管从哪方面看，这都是她应该做的）；她要是设法去进一步了解她，尽量去亲近她，力求跟她做朋友，而不是跟哈丽特·史密斯做朋友，那八成就不会有现在这些烦恼。就出身、天分和教养来看，两人中有一个可以做她的朋友，本该是她求之不得的，而那另一个呢——她是什么人呢？就算她们俩没有成为亲密的朋友，就算费尔法克斯小姐在这个重大问题上没向她推心置腹——这是很可能的——然而，就凭她对费尔法克斯小姐应有的了解，她也不该胡乱猜疑她与迪克逊先生关系暧昧。她不仅极其荒唐地胡乱猜疑，而且还要讲给别人听，这就越发不可原谅。她很担心，由于弗兰克·邱吉尔的轻率或粗心，这一想法给简的脆弱感情带来了很大的痛苦。她觉得，简自从到海伯里以后，给她造成痛苦的种种根源中，最糟糕的一定是她爱玛了。她简直成了她的老冤家。每次他们三个人在一起，她总要无数次地刺伤简的心。而在博克斯山，她那颗心也许痛苦到了极点，再也无法忍受了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The weather affected Mr. Woodhouse, and he could only be kept tolerably comfortable by almost ceaseless attention on his daughter's side, and by exertions which had never cost her half so much before. It reminded her of their first forlorn tete-a-tete, on the evening of Mrs. Weston's wedding-day; but Mr. Knightley had walked in then, soon after tea, and dissipated every melancholy fancy. Alas! such delightful proofs of Hartfield's attraction, as those sort of visits conveyed, might shortly be over. The picture which she had then drawn of the privations of the approaching winter, had proved erroneous; no friends had deserted them, no pleasures had been lost. -- But her present forebodings she feared would experience no similar contradiction. The prospect before her now, was threatening to a degree that could not be entirely dispelled -- that might not be even partially brightened. If all took place that might take place among the circle of her friends, Hartfield must be comparatively deserted; and she left to cheer her father with the spirits only of ruined happiness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="伍德豪斯先生受天气影响，他女儿几乎在一刻不停地关照他，付出了比平常多得多的努力，才使他觉得还算好受些。这时候，爱玛不由得想起了韦斯顿太太结婚的那天晚上，他们父女俩第一次孤苦伶仃在一起的情景。不过，那次吃过茶点后不久，奈特利先生就走了进来，驱散了一切的忧思。唉！类似这样的探访说明哈特菲尔德还是个令人喜欢的地方，但是也许好景不长了。当时，她为即将到来的冬天描绘出一幅凄凄凉凉的景象，可结果证明她错了。他们既没失哪个朋友，也没失去任何欢乐。可是她在担心，这一次不祥的预感不会出现适得其反的结果。她眼下面临的前景就有点预兆不祥，不可能被完全消除——甚至不可能出现几分光明。如果她的朋友中间能发生的事都发生了的话，那哈特菲尔德一定会变得冷冷清清，她只能怀着幸福已经破灭的心情，来逗父亲高兴。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The evening of this day was very long, and melancholy, at Hartfield. The weather added what it could of gloom. A cold stormy rain set in, and nothing of July appeared but in the trees and shrubs, which the wind was despoiling, and the length of the day, which only made such cruel sights the longer visible.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈特菲尔德的这天黄昏又漫长又陰沉，平添了几分陰郁的气氛。骤然袭来一场陰冷的暴风雨，除了树林和灌木丛中的绿叶受到狂风的摧残，白昼延长可以让人多瞧一瞧这凄凉的景象以外，已经丝毫看不到七月的景致。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The child to be born at Randalls must be a tie there even dearer than herself; and Mrs. Weston's heart and time would be occupied by it. They should lose her; and, probably, in great measure, her husband also. -- Frank Churchill would return among them no more; and Miss Fairfax, it was reasonable to suppose, would soon cease to belong to Highbury. They would be married, and settled either at or near Enscombe. All that were good would be withdrawn; and if to these losses, the loss of Donwell were to be added, what would remain of cheerful or of rational society within their reach? Mr. Knightley to be no longer coming there for his evening comfort! -- No longer walking in at all hours, as if ever willing to change his own home for their's! -- How was it to be endured? And if he were to be lost to them for Harriet's sake; if he were to be thought of hereafter, as finding in Harriet's society all that he wanted; if Harriet were to be the chosen, the first, the dearest, the friend, the wife to whom he looked for all the best blessings of existence; what could be increasing Emma's wretchedness but the reflection never far distant from her mind, that it had been all her own work?</div>

<div class="line_en">When it came to such a pitch as this, she was not able to refrain from a start, or a heavy sigh, or even from walking about the room for a few seconds-and the only source whence any thing like consolation or composure could be drawn, was in the resolution of her own better conduct, and the hope that, however inferior in spirit and gaiety might be the following and every future winter of her life to the past, it would yet find her more rational, more acquainted with herself, and leave her less to regret when it were gone.</div>
