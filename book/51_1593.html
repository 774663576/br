<div class="line_en">The hovercraft materializes overhead and two ladders drop, only there's no way I'm letting go of Peeta. I keep one arm around him as I help him up, and we each place a foot on the first rung of the ladder. The electric current freezes us in place, and this time I'm glad because I'm not really sure Peeta can hang on for the whole ride. And since my eyes were looking down, I can see that while our muscles are immobile, nothing is preventing the blood from draining out of Peeta's leg. Sure enough, the minute the door closes behind us and the current stops, he slumps to the floor unconscious.</div>

<div class="line_en">I slump down on the floor, my face against the door, staring uncomprehendingly at the crystal glass in my hand. Icy cold, filled with orange juice, a straw with a frilly white collar. How wrong it looks in my bloody, filthy hand with its dirt-caked nails and scars. My mouth waters at the smell, but I place it carefully on the floor, not trusting anything so clean and pretty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我颓然坐在地上，脸抵着玻璃门，不解地望着手里透明的玻璃瓶。瓶子冰凉，里面盛着橘子汁，插着一支带褶皱边的吸管。汽水瓶放在我血迹斑斑、伤痕累累、指甲盖里满是泥痕的手里显得多么不相称。闻到汽水味，我的嘴里流出口水，可我把它放在地上，对于任何如此干净漂亮的东西都不予信任。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">My fingers are still gripping the back of his jacket so tightly that when they take him away it tears leaving me with a fistful of black fabric. Doctors in sterile white, masked and gloved, already prepped to operate, go into action. Peeta's so pale and still on a silver table, tubes and wires springing out of him every which way, and for a moment I forget we're out of the Games and I see the doctors as just one more threat, one more pack of mutts designed to kill him. Petrified, I lunge for him, but I'm caught and thrust back into another room, and a glass door seals between us. I pound on the glass, screaming my head off. Everyone ignores me except for some Capitol attendant who appears behind me and offers me a beverage.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我的手仍牢牢地抓着皮塔的后背，他们拽走他时，我的手抓下一撮纤维。医生穿着消了毒的白大褂，戴着口罩和手套，已做好了准备，立即开始手术。皮塔脸色苍白地躺在手术台上，身上插满管子。恍惚之间，我仍觉得身处饥饿游戏之中，医生仿佛是充满威胁的另外一群野狗，要设计杀死他。我万分惊恐，冲上去护住皮塔，可被人一把抓住，扔进另一个房间，和皮塔之间隔着一层玻璃。我使劲敲着玻璃，大喊着皮塔的名字。没人理我，只有一些凯匹特服务人员出现在我身后，递给我一些饮料。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When I wake, I'm afraid to move at first. The entire ceiling glows with a soft yellow light allowing me to see that I'm in a room containing just my bed. No doors, no windows are visible. The air smells of something sharp and antiseptic. My right arm has several tubes that extend into the wall behind me. I'm naked, but the bedclothes are soothing against my skin. I tentatively lift my left hand above the cover. Not only has it been scrubbed clean, the nails are filed in perfect ovals, the scars from the burns are less prominent. I touch my cheek, my lips, the puckered scar above my eyebrow, and am just running my fingers through my silken hair when I freeze. Apprehensively I ruffle the hair by my left ear. No, it wasn't an illusion. I can hear again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我醒来时，起先不敢动。整个房间的天花板发出柔和的黄光，我可以看清自己待在一个只有一张床的房间里。没有门，也看不到明显的窗户。房间的空气有股刺鼻的消毒水味。我的右臂插着几根管子，延伸到我身后的墙上。我没有穿衣服，但被单贴着我的身体，很舒服。我试着把左手伸到被单外面。胳膊不仅被搓洗干净了，而且指甲也修剪成完美的椭圆形，烧伤留下的疤痕也不那么明显了。我摸摸脖子、胳膊腿、额头上的伤疤，正在摸柔滑的头发时，我呆住了。我小心地抚弄左耳边的头发，不，这不是幻觉，我又能听见了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I try and sit up, but some sort of wide restraining band around my waist keeps me from rising more than a few inches. The physical confinement makes me panic and I'm trying to pull myself up and wriggle my hips through the band when a portion of the wall slides open and in steps the redheaded Avox girl carrying a tray. The sight of her calms me and I stop trying to escape. I want to ask her a million questions, but I'm afraid any familiarity would cause her harm. Obviously I am being closely monitored. She sets the tray across my thighs and presses something that raises me to a sitting position. While she adjusts my pillows, I risk one question. I say it out loud, as clearly as my rusty voice will allow, so nothing will seem secretive. "Did Peeta make it?" She gives me a nod, and as she slips a spoon into my hand, I feel the pressure of friendship.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我试着坐起来，可腰上打着一条宽带子，身体只能抬起几英寸高。这宽带让我紧张，我扭动身躯想从里面钻出来，这时墙壁向两边敞开，红发艾瓦克斯女孩端着一个托盘走进来。看到她我稳定下来，不再试图逃脱。我有一万个问题想问她，可又怕与她过于亲近引起她惊慌。显然我受到严密监视。她把托盘放在我大腿上，按了一下按钮，把我推到坐起的位置。她为我弄枕头的当儿，我冒险问了一个问题。我尽可能故意用我沙哑的声音大声说，显出没有秘密。“皮塔活下来了吗？”她冲我点点头，当她把勺子放在我手里时，我感觉到朋友才有的力度。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As the Avox leaves, the door closes noiselessly after her and I turn hungrily to the tray. A bowl of clear broth, a small serving of applesauce, and a glass of water. This is it? I think grouchily. Shouldn't my homecoming dinner be a little more spectacular? But I find it's an effort to finish the spare meal before me. My stomach seems to have shrunk to the size of a chestnut, and I have to wonder how long I've been out because I had no trouble eating a fairly sizable breakfast that last morning in the arena. There's usually a lag of a few days between the end of the competition and the presentation of the victor so that they can put the starving, wounded, mess of a person back together again. Somewhere, Cinna and Portia will be creating our wardrobes for the public appearances. Haymitch and Effie will be arranging the banquet for our sponsors, reviewing the questions for our final interviews. Back home, District 12 is probably in chaos as they try and organize the homecoming celebrations for Peeta and me, given that the last one was close to thirty years ago.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那个艾瓦克斯离开了，门无声地在她身后关闭，我饥饿地盯着盘子，一盘稀肉汤、一小点果酱，还有一杯水。“就这点？”我在心里不满地嘀咕着。难道欢迎我回来的食物不应该比这更丰盛些？可我发现自己吃完这点东西都很费力。我的胃好像缩到栗子那么大。我纳闷究竟有多久没吃饭了，因为在竞技场的最后一天早上我还吃了相当多东西。通常情况下，在比赛结束和胜利者再次露面之间留出几天时间，这样可以让饥肠辘辘、伤痕累累、憔悴不堪的胜利者恢复一下。在某个地方，西纳和波西娅正在为我们赶制公开露面的服装。黑密斯和艾菲也正在准备宴请我们的赞助人，并为我们的最后采访准备问题。在家乡，十二区肯定已经为迎接我和皮塔的归来忙作一团，毕竟，上一次获胜已经是近三十年前的事了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I want to get out of this bed. To see Peeta and Cinna, to find out more about what's been going on. And why shouldn't I? I feel fine. But as I start to work my way out of the band, I feel a cold liquid seeping into my vein from one of the tubes and almost immediately lose consciousness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我想马上从这张床上走下去，去看皮塔，去看西纳，知道更多的事情。为什么不行呢？我感觉很好。可当我正要从绑在腰上的宽带子里爬出来的时候，一股凉凉的液体从一根管子里注进我的血管，我几乎马上失去知觉。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This happens on and off for an indeterminate amount of time. My waking, eating, and, even though I resist the impulse to try and escape the bed, being knocked out again. I seem to be in a strange, continual twilight. Only a few things register. The redheaded Avox girl has not returned since the feeding, my scars are disappearing, and do I imagine it? Or do I hear a man's voice yelling? Not in the Capitol accent, but in the rougher cadences of home. And I can't help having a vague, comforting feeling that someone is looking out for me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这样的事反复了好几回，也不知经过了多长时间，似乎我总是醒来，然后吃饭。我尽量克制逃跑的念头，以免再次给弄晕过去。但奇怪，我看到的好像总是黄昏时分。我只知道几件事。那个红头发的艾瓦克斯自从喂完我饭后就没再来过；我的伤疤不见了；还有，是我的错觉吗？一个男人在喊？不是凯匹特口音，而是接近家乡能口音。我心里隐隐觉得很安慰，总算有人在找寻我。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then finally, the time arrives when I come to and there's nothing plugged into my right arm. The restraint around my middle has been removed and I am free to move about. I start to sit up but am arrested by the sight of my hands. The skin's perfection, smooth and glowing. Not only are the scars from the arena gone, but those accumulated over years of hunting have vanished without a trace. My forehead feels like satin, and when I try to find the burn on my calf, there's nothing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="总算熬过来了，我已渐渐恢复，右臂不再插管子，我身上的宽带子也去掉了，允许自由活动。我开始慢慢坐起来，看型自己的手时惊呆了。受伤的皮肤光滑亮洁，不但伤疤没了，就连打猎时留下的伤痕也无影无踪。我的前额像缎子般光滑，我看看小腿，一点疤痕也没有。">查看中文翻译</div>

I step into a wide, deserted hall that appears to have no other doors on it. But it must. And behind one of them must be Peeta. Now that I'm conscious and moving, I'm growing more and more anxious about him. He must be all right or the Avox girl wouldn't have said so. But I need to see him for myself.</div>

<div class="line_en">I turn and see them all waiting in a big chamber at the end of the hall -- Effie, Haymitch, and Cinna. My feet take off without hesitation. Maybe a victor should show more restraint, more superiority, especially when she knows this will be on tape, but I don't care. I run for them and surprise even myself when I launch into Haymitch's arms first. When he whispers in my ear, "Nice job, sweetheart," it doesn't sound sarcastic. Effie's somewhat teary and keeps patting my hair and talking about how she told everyone we were pearls. Cinna just hugs me tight and doesn't say anything. Then I notice Portia is absent and get a bad feeling.</div>

The hospital then is far underground, even beneath the gym where the tributes practiced tying knots and throwing spears. The windows of the lobby are darkened, and a handful of guards stand on duty. No one else is there to see us cross to the tribute elevator. Our footsteps echo in the emptiness. And when we ride up to the twelfth floor, the faces of all the tributes who will never return flash across my mind and there's a heavy, tight place in my chest.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="电梯门打开了，维妮娅、弗莱维、奥克塔维亚拥上来将我围住，兴奋地叽叽喳喳地说个不停，说话快得叫我听不清他们说什么。但我明白他们心里想的是什么，那就是他们见到我发自内心地高兴。我也很高兴见到他们，虽然不像见到西纳那么高兴。见到他们就像在经过艰难的一天后，回家看到的三个你最喜爱的宠物。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We don't wallow around in the Games this way in District 12. We grit our teeth and watch because we must and try to get back to business as soon as possible when they're over. To keep from hating the prep team, I effectively tune out most of what they're saying.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在十二区，人们对饥饿游戏的态度却并非如此。人们边看，边恨得咬牙切齿，因为比赛结束后，人们还要尽快恢复正常的生活秩序。为了免于对他们心生厌恶，我干脆不听他们说的话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They take care of the shower settings for me, and they go to work on my hair, nails, and makeup when I'm done. They chatter so continuously that I barely have to reply, which is good, since I don't feel very talkative. It's funny, because even though they're rattling on about the Games, it's all about where they were or what they were doing or how they felt when a specific event occurred. "I was still in bed!" "I had just had my eyebrows dyed!" "I swear I nearly fainted!" Everything is about them, not the dying boys and girls in the arena.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们为我调好冲澡的水，然后为我做头发、修指甲、化妆。在我身旁不停地说着，我几乎不用回答。这样很好，反正我也不太想说话。可笑的是，虽然他们说的全是饥饿游戏的事，可都是说发生一件特别的事情时他们在哪里、在干什么、有什么感觉。“那时我还在床上！”“我刚染了一边的眉毛！”“我发誓我差点昏过去！”说的全是他们自己，而不是那些在竞技场死掉的“贡品”。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你觉得怎么样？”西纳问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I am still the "girl on fire." The sheer fabric softly glows. Even the slight movement in the air sends a ripple up my body. By comparison, the chariot costume seems garish, the interview dress too contrived. In this dress, I give the illusion of wearing candlelight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我仍然是“燃烧的女孩”。衣服料子发出柔和的光泽。即使是轻微的移动也能显现出我身体的曲线。相比之下，开幕式在战车上穿的服装显得十分炫目，在电视访谈时的服装太不自然；而这套服装，让人有种沐浴在珠光中的感觉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I know," says Cinna before I can object. "But the Gamemakers wanted to alter you surgically. Haymitch had a huge fight with them over it. This was the compromise." He stops me before I can look at my reflection. "Wait, don't forget the shoes." Venia helps me into a pair of flat leather sandals and I turn to the mirror.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我知道，”还没等我开口表示反对，西纳抢先说道，“大赛组织者想通过外科手术为你整形，黑密斯为此跟他们大闹了一场，现在这是折中的方案。”我刚要去照镜子，他却拉住我。“等等，别把鞋忘了。”维妮娅帮我穿上一双平底凉鞋，我转身看镜子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I think it's the best yet," I say. When I manage to pull my eyes away from the flickering fabric, I'm in for something of a shock. My hair's loose, held back by a simple hairband. The makeup rounds and fills out the sharp angles of my face. A clear polish coats my nails. The sleeveless dress is gathered at my ribs, not my waist, largely eliminating any help the padding would have given my figure. The hem falls just to my knees. Without heels, you can see my true stature. I look, very simply, like a girl. A young one. Fourteen at the most. Innocent. Harmless. Yes, it is shocking that Cinna has pulled this off when you remember I've just won the Games.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我觉得这是最好的。”我说。当我的视线从闪着珠光的衣料上移到头发上时，我吃了一惊。我的头发已经放了下来，用一条发带轻轻揽到脑后；化妆去除了我脸上的棱角，指甲也涂了指甲油，无袖长裙在我的腰部——啊不，是肋下——收拢，比垫胸更好地突出我的线条，带褶皱的裙摆垂到我的膝盖。穿上平跟鞋，更能显出我自然的身材，我看上去非常朴实，正如任何一个普通女孩，一个年轻的女孩，顶多十四岁，纯洁无瑕。是啊，很难想象西纳怎么能抓住并凸显一个女孩本身的特点，而这个女孩刚在一场残酷的竞赛中获胜。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Peeta? No, it's not about Peeta. It's about the Capitol and the Gamemakers and the audience. Although I do not yet understand Cinna's design, it's a reminder the Games are not quite finished. And beneath his benign reply, I sense a warning. Of something he can't even mention in front of his own team.</div>

<div class="line_en">We take the elevator to the level where we trained. It's customary for the victor and his or her support team to rise from beneath the stage. First the prep team, followed by the escort, the stylist, the mentor, and finally the victor. Only this year, with two victors who share both an escort and a mentor, the whole thing has had to be rethought. I find myself in a poorly lit area under the stage. A brand-new metal plate has been installed to transport me upward. You can still see small piles of sawdust, smell fresh paint. Cinna and the prep team peel off to change into their own costumes and take their positions, leaving me alone. In the gloom, I see a makeshift wall about ten yards away and assume Peeta's behind it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们坐电梯来到训练场所在楼层，按照惯例，胜利者和他或她的团队要从舞台下升上去，先是设计团队、陪同人员、指导老师，最后是胜利者。而今年，由于有两个胜利者，分享一组陪同人员和指导老师，所以整个安排要重新考虑。我站在昏暗的舞台下，一个崭新的金属板会把我托上去。地上仍散落着小片的锯末，四周散发出油漆的味道。西纳和他的设计团队已经下去换自己的服装，留下我一个人站在那里。在昏暗的光线下，我看到十码之外有一堵临时墙，我想皮塔就站在那堵墙的后面。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The damp, moldy smell beneath the stage threatens to choke me. A cold, clammy sweat breaks out on my skin and I can't rid myself of the feeling that the boards above my head are about to collapse, to bury me alive under the rubble.
