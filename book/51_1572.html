<div class="line_en">Why do these people speak in such a high pitch? Why do their jaws barely open when they talk? Why do the ends of their sentences go up as if they're asking a question? Odd vowels, clipped words, and always a hiss on the letter s… no wonder it's impossible not to mimic them.</div>

<div class="line_en">I've been in the Remake Center for more than three hours and I still haven't met my stylist. Apparently he has no interest in seeing me until Venia and the other members of my prep team have addressed some obvious problems. This has included scrubbing down my body with a gritty foam that has removed not only dirt but at least three layers of skin, turning my nails into uniform shapes, and primarily, ridding my body of hair. My legs, arms, torso, underarms, and parts of my eyebrows have been stripped of the stuff, leaving me like a plucked bird, ready for roasting. I don't like it. My skin feels sore and tingling and intensely vulnerable. But I have kept my side of the bargain with Haymitch, and no objection has crossed my lips.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="来到形象设计中心已经三个多小时了，可还没有见到我的形象设计师。显然，在形象设计小组其他成员将主要问题解决之前，他是没有兴趣见我的。她们用磨砂泡沫擦洗我的全身――不仅把泥洗掉了，甚至搓掉了三层皮，把指甲剪成一模一样的形状，还有，主要就是拔掉我身上的汗毛――腿上、胳膊上、腋下，还有一些眉毛也拔掉了，弄得我像是拔了毛、等着烤熟的鸡。我真不喜欢这样。我的肉皮又疼又麻，简直不能碰。可是我得听黑密斯的，我没说一个不字。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Venia and Octavia, a plump woman whose entire body has been dyed a pale shade of pea green, rub me down with a lotion that first stings but then soothes my raw skin. Then they pull me from the table, removing the thin robe I've been allowed to wear off and on. I stand there, completely naked, as the three circle me, wielding tweezers to remove any last bits of hair. I know I should be embarrassed, but they're so unlike people that I'm no more self-conscious than if a trio of oddly colored birds were pecking around my feet.</div>

Instead my hands go to my hairdo, the one area of my body my prep team had been told to leave alone. My fingers stroke the silky braids my mother so carefully arranged. My mother. I left her blue dress and shoes on the floor of my train car, never thinking about retrieving them, of trying to hold on to a piece of her, of home. Now I wish I had.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Just give me a moment, all right?" he asks. He walks around my naked body, not touching me, but taking in every inch of it with his eyes. I resist the impulse to cross my arms over my chest. "Who did your hair?"</div>

<div class="line_en">The door opens and a young man who must be Cinna enters. I'm taken aback by how normal he looks. Most of the stylists they interview on television are so dyed, stenciled, and surgically altered they're grotesque. But Cinna's close-cropped hair appears to be its natural shade of brown. He's in a simple black shirt and pants. The only concession to self-alteration seems to be metallic gold eyeliner that has been applied with a light hand. It brings out the flecks of gold in his green eyes. And, despite my disgust with the Capitol and their hideous fashions, I can't help thinking how attractive it looks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="门开了，一个年轻人走进来，这人准就是西纳。他外表看起来没什么特别之处，这让我吃惊。电视采访中出现的设计师多数都染了头发，做过整形手术，以致外表看起来十分怪异。可西纳头发很服帖，似乎是自然的棕色。他穿着朴素的黑色衬衫和裤子，唯一的修饰就是轻描的亮金色眼线，在他的绿眼睛里映出了斑点。尽管我讨厌凯匹特和他们的恶俗，我还是不禁觉得他很吸引人呢。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“您是新来的，对吧？我以前好像从没见过您。”我说。大部分的设计师都是熟悉的面孔，总给不同的“贡品”服务，有些人的面孔我都看见过好多年了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Pulling on my robe, I follow him through a door into a sitting room. Two red couches face off over a low table. Three walls are blank, the fourth is entirely glass, providing a window to the city. I can see by the light that it must be around noon, although the sunny sky has turned overcast. Cinna invites me to sit on one of the couches and takes his place across from me. He presses a button on the side of the table. The top splits and from below rises a second tabletop that holds our lunch. Chicken and chunks of oranges cooked in a creamy sauce laid on a bed of pearly white grain, tiny green peas and onions, rolls shaped like flowers, and for dessert, a pudding the color of honey.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="穿上长袍，我跟在他身后，穿过一扇门，来到一间会客室。两张红色的睡椅隔着一张小桌对面放着，房间的三面墙壁上没有任何装饰，有一个整面的玻璃墙，从那可以看到外面的城市。从室外的光线看，现在应该正是中午，晴朗的天空此时已变得阴沉沉的。西纳邀我坐在一张睡椅上，他在对面坐下。接着他按下了桌旁的一个按钮，桌面从中间打开，从里面升起了另一张小桌，上面放着我们的午饭：有烤鸡，花形蛋卷，还有一道菜下面铺着白米、小绿豌豆和洋葱丁，上面是橘子丁浇奶油沙司，至于甜点，是蜂蜜般黄灿灿的布丁。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">What must it be like, I wonder, to live in a world where food appears at the press of a button? How would I spend the hours I now commit to combing the woods for sustenance if it were so easy to come by? What do they do all day, these people in the Capitol, besides decorating their bodies and waiting around for a new shipment of tributes to roll in and die for their entertainment?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我心中暗想，住在一个只要一揿按钮饭菜就出现的世界里，会是什么样的感觉？我为一日三餐而在林中奔波的时间，要是在这里又该怎么打发呢？这些凯匹特人除了每天打扮自己，等着几个“贡品”被运到这里送死以供他们取乐，还有什么其他的事情可做呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I try to imagine assembling this meal myself back home. Chickens are too expensive, but I could make do with a wild turkey. I'd need to shoot a second turkey to trade for an orange. Goat's milk would have to substitute for cream. We can grow peas in the garden. I'd have to get wild onions from the woods. I don't recognize the grain, our own tessera ration cooks down to an unattractive brown mush. Fancy rolls would mean another trade with the baker, perhaps for two or three squirrels. As for the pudding, I can't even guess what's in it. Days of hunting and gathering for this one meal and even then it would be a poor substitution for the Capitol version.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我心里盘算着在家里做这样一顿饭需要什么。首先，鸡太贵了，我可以用野火鸡代替，我还要再打到一只火鸡，好换到橘子。羊奶代替奶油。我们可以在园子里种些豌豆。我还要从林子里搞到野洋葱。我认不得那种米，我们用食品券换的米做熟以后是的浅褐色碎粒。要做漂亮蛋卷就得去跟面包师换，也许还要两三只松鼠。至于布丁，我猜不出里面究竟放了什么。为弄这顿饭要打好多天猎，还要到处交换，做出来的东西恐怕远不如凯匹特的这顿饭好吃。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For the opening ceremonies, you're supposed to wear something that suggests your district's principal industry. District 11, agriculture. District 4, fishing. District 3, factories. This means that coming from District 12, Peeta and I will be in some kind of coal miner's getup. Since the baggy miner's jumpsuits are not particularly becoming, our tributes usually end up in skimpy outfits and hats with headlamps. One year, our tributes were stark naked and covered in black powder to represent coal dust. It's always dreadful and does nothing to win favor with the crowd. I prepare myself for the worst.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在开幕式上，每位选手都要穿上反映本区主要发展特色的服装。例如：十一区是农业，四区是渔业，三区是工业。这就是说，皮塔和我要穿采煤工人的服装式样。因为矿工肥大的连裤工装不太适合这种场合，我们的选手常代之以较合身的工作服和戴有头灯的安全帽。有一年，我们的“贡品”浑身赤裸，全身涂满代表煤炭的黑色粉末。这种装扮差强人意，难以赢得观众的喜爱。而此时我也做好了最坏的打算。">查看中文翻译</div>

In no time at all, we are approaching the door and I can see that between the overcast sky and evening hour the light is turning gray. The tributes from District 11 are just rolling out when Cinna appears with a lighted torch. "Here we go then," he says, and before we can react he sets our capes on fire. I gasp, waiting for the heat, but there is only a faint tickling sensation. Cinna climbs up before us and ignites our headdresses. He lets out a sigh of relief. "It works." Then he gently tucks a hand under my chin. "Remember, heads high. Smiles. They're going to love you!"</div>

Every head is turned our way, pulling the focus from the three chariots ahead of us. At first, I'm frozen, but then I catch sight of us on a large television screen and am floored by how breathtaking we look. In the deepening twilight, the firelight illuminates our faces. We seem to be leaving a trail of fire off the flowing capes. Cinna was right about the minimal makeup, we both look more attractive but utterly recognizable.</div>

I'm glad now I have Peeta to clutch for balance, he is so steady, solid as a rock. As I gain confidence, I actually blow a few kisses to the crowd.
