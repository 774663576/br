<div class="line_en">It was raining the morning the Vatican staff banged on the camerlegno's door, awakening him from a fitful sleep. The Pope, they said, was not answering his door or his phone. The clergy were frightened. The camerlegno was the only one who could enter the Pope's chambers unannounced.</div>

<div class="line_en">Camerlegno Ventresca's white robe billowed as he moved down the hallway away from the Sistine Chapel. The Swiss Guards had seemed perplexed when he emerged all alone from the chapel and told them he needed a moment of solitude. But they had obeyed, letting him go.</div>

<div class="line_en">Now as he rounded the corner and left their sight, the camerlegno felt a maelstrom of emotions like nothing he thought possible in human experience.

He had fallen to his knees, awash with doubt, his ears straining for the voice of God but hearing only silence. He had begged for a sign. Guidance. Direction. Was this God's will?

<div class="line_en">High above on the balcony, like a soul tearing free of its corporeal restrains, a luminous pyre of flame erupted from the camerlegno's center. The fire shot upward, engulfing his entire body instantly. He did not scream. He raised his arms over his head and looked toward heaven. The conflagration roared around him, entirely shrouding his body in a column of light. It raged for what seemed like an eternity, the whole world bearing witness. The light flared brighter and brighter. Then, gradually, the flames dissipated. The camerlegno was gone. Whether he had collapsed behind the balustrade or evaporated into thin air was impossible to tell. All that was left was a cloud of smoke spiraling skyward over Vatican City.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在高高的中央阳台上，就像一个灵魂脱离了肉身的束缚，总司库胸中爆出一团发光的火焰。火往上直衝，瞬间吞噬全身。他没喊叫，只是双手高举过头，望向天空。大火轰然围住他，紧紧将他的身体裹成一根光柱。烈焰狂烧彷彿化作永恒，全世界都见证了。那道光烧得愈来愈亮。然后火焰逐渐消失。总司库走了。看不出来他是倒在栏杆后或是消散在空气中。只留下一缕烟雾盘旋著，升入梵蒂冈城上空。">查看中文翻译</div>
