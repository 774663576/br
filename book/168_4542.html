<div class="line_en">Her Dothraki scouts had told her how it was, but Dany wanted to see for herself. Ser Jorah Mormont rode with her through a birchwood forest and up a slanting sandstone ridge. "Near enough," he warned her at the crest.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I'd say so." Ser Jorah pointed. "Those are sellswords on the flanks. Lances and mounted bowmen, with swords and axes for the close work. The Second Sons on the left wing, the Stormcrows to the right. About five hundred men apiece. See the banners?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我也这么认为。”乔拉边说边指，“两翼是佣兵，装备长枪和弓箭，并配有剑斧用于近战。左翼次子团，右翼暴鸦团，各约五百人，看到那些旗帜了吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Yunkai's harpy grasped a whip and iron collar in her talons instead of a length of chain. But the sellswords flew their own standards beneath those of the city they served: on the right four crows between crossed thunderbolts, on the left a broken sword. "The Yunkai'i hold the center themselves," Dany noted. Their officers looked indistinguishable from Astapor's at a distance; tall bright helms and cloaks sewn with flashing copper disks. "Are those slave soldiers they lead?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="渊凯的鹰身女妖爪里抓的是鞭子和铁项圈，而非一段锁链。但佣兵有自己的旗帜，在他们所效力的城市徽记下飞扬：右面是嵌在两道交叉闪电间的四只乌鸦，左面是一把断剑。“渊凯人自守中路，”丹妮说，从远观之，他们的军官跟阿斯塔波人没有区别，高耸明亮的头盔，披风上缝有许多闪亮铜盘，“带的是奴兵？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dany considered. The slaver host seemed small compared to her own numbers, but the sellswords were ahorse. She'd ridden too long with Dothraki not to have a healthy respect for what mounted warriors could do to foot. The Unsullied could withstand their charge, but my freedmen will be slaughtered. "The slavers like to talk," she said. "Send word that I will hear them this evening in my tent. And invite the captains of the sellsword companies to call on me as well. But not together. The Stormcrows at midday, the Second Sons two hours later."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="丹妮思考片刻。对方的奴隶军团比自己的部队人数少很多，但佣兵都有马，她曾跟多斯拉克人驰骋疆场，完全清楚马上战士对步卒的影响。无垢者可以抵挡冲击，但我的自由民会被屠杀。“奴隶贩子们乐于谈判，”她说，“传话过去，就说今晚我接见他们，同时也邀请佣兵队长们造访——但不要一起来，暴鸦团安排在正午，次子团晚两个小时。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Slate skies and brisk winds saw Dany back to her host. The deep ditch that would encircle her camp was already half dug, and the woods were full of Unsullied lopping branches off birch trees to sharpen into stakes. The eunuchs could not sleep in an unfortified camp, or so Grey Worm insisted. He was there watching the work. Dany halted a moment to speak with him. "Yunkai has girded up her loins for battle."</div>

<div class="line_en">One of the first things Dany had done after the fall of Astapor was abolish the custom of giving the Unsullied new slave names every day. Most of those born free had returned to their birth names; those who still remembered them, at least. others had called themselves after heroes or gods, and sometimes weapons, gems, and even flowers, which resulted in soldiers with some very peculiar names, to Dany's ears. Grey Worm had remained Grey Worm. When she asked him why, he said, "It is a lucky name. The name this one was born to was accursed. That was the name he had when he was taken for a slave. But Grey Worm is the name this one drew the day Daenerys Stormborn set him free."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="攻取阿斯塔波之后，丹妮首先做的事情之一便是废除无垢者每天被赋予一个新名的惯例。生为自由民的人多半用回诞生时的名字——至少那些仍记得自己名字的人是如此。其他人则用英雄和神祗的名字称呼自己，有时则是武器、宝石，甚至花，丹妮听来十分奇特。灰虫子仍叫灰虫子，她问他为何不改，他说：“因为它很幸运。小人出生时的名字受了诅咒，所以被迫成为奴隶。但灰虫子是小人被‘风暴降生’丹妮莉丝解放那天所抽到的名字。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The raggle-taggle host of freedmen dwarfed her own, but they were more burden than benefit. Perhaps one in a hundred had a donkey, a camel, or an ox; most carried weapons looted from some slaver's armory, but only one in ten was strong enough to fight, and none was trained. They ate the land bare as they passed, like locusts in sandals. Yet Dany could not bring herself to abandon them as Ser Jorah and her bloodriders urged. I told them they were free. I cannot tell them now they are not free to join me. She gazed at the smoke rising from their cookfires and swallowed a sigh. She might have the best footsoldiers in the world, but she also had the worst.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="破破烂烂的自由民队伍的规模令她的军团相形见拙，而他们更是没有益助的负担。一百人中才一个有驴、骆驼或牛，多数人带着从奴隶商人的军械库里夺来的兵器，这没错，但十人中只有一个够强壮，足以参战，且所有人都未经训练。他们吃光途经土地上的一切，好比会穿鞋的蝗虫。另一方面，丹妮无法接受乔拉爵士和血盟卫们的催促，抛弃他们，我给了他们自由，总不能禁止他们自由地加入吧？她凝视着烟雾从无数炊火上升起，强咽下一声叹息。也许自己同时拥有世界上最好和最糟的步兵。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Within the perimeter the Unsullied had established, the tents were going up in orderly rows, with her own tall golden pavilion at the center. A second encampment lay close beyond her own; five times the size, sprawling and chaotic, this second camp had no ditches, no tents, no sentries, no horselines. Those who had horses or mules slept beside them, for fear they might be stolen. Goats, sheep, and half-starved dogs wandered freely amongst hordes of women, children, and old men. Dany had left Astapor in the hands of a council of former slaves led by a healer, a scholar, and a priest. Wise men all, she thought, and just. Yet even so, tens of thousands preferred to follow her to Yunkai, rather than remain behind in Astapor. I gave them the city, and most of them were too frightened to take it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在无垢者们建立的营地之内，帐篷整齐地排列成行，正中乃是她那顶高高的金色大帐。另一片营地位于旁边，大小是这里的五倍，混乱无序，没有壕沟，没有帐篷，没有岗哨，马匹也没有排成队列。马或骡子的主人就睡在牲口下面，以防被盗。山羊、绵羊和饥饿的狗肆意游荡，混杂在妇孺老幼中间。丹妮将阿斯塔波留给一个由前奴隶组成的议会管理，由一名医生、一名学者和一名牧师领导，她认定其智慧与公正，即便如此，仍有数万人乐意跟她去渊凯，不想留在阿斯塔波。我把城市交给他们，他们却害怕起来，不敢接受。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yunkai will have war," Dany told Whitebeard inside the pavilion. Irri and Jhiqui had covered the floor with carpets while Missandei lit a stick of incense to sweeten the dusty air. Drogon and Rhaegal were asleep atop some cushions, curled about each other, but Viserion perched on the edge of her empty bath. "Missandei, what language will these Yunkai'i speak, Valyrian?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Arstan Whitebeard stood outside the entrance of her tent, while Strong Belwas sat crosslegged on the grass nearby, eating a bowl of figs. on the march, the duty of guarding her fell upon their shoulders. She had made Jhogo, Aggo, and Rakharo her kos as well as her bloodriders, and just now she needed them more to command her Dothraki than to protect her person. Her khalasar was tiny, some thirty-odd mounted warriors, and most of them braidless boys and bentback old men. Yet they were all the horse she had, and she dared not go without them. The Unsullied might be the finest infantry in all the world, as Ser Jorah claimed, but she needed scouts and outriders as well.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="白胡子阿斯坦站在帐篷门外，壮汉贝沃斯则盘腿坐于附近草地，吃着一碗无花果。行军途中，保护她的责任便落在他俩肩上。乔戈、阿戈和拉卡洛早已被她封为寇，不只是血盟卫，此刻更需要他们指挥多斯拉克人，而非单单关注她的个人安全。她的卡拉萨虽小，大约才三十来个骑马战士，且大多是没绑辫子的男孩和驼背老人，但却是仅有的骑兵，十分重要。正如乔拉爵士所说，也许无垢者是世界上最好的步兵，可她还需要斥候和哨卫。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ser Jorah Mormont returned an hour later, accompanied by three captains of the Stormcrows. They wore black feathers on their polished helms, and claimed to be all equal in honor and authority. Dany studied them as Irri and Jhiqui poured the wine. Prendahl na Ghezn was a thickset Ghiscari with a broad face and dark hair going grey; Sallor the Bald had a twisting scar across his pale Qartheen cheek; and Daario Naharis was flamboyant even for a Tyroshi. His beard was cut into three prongs and dyed blue, the same color as his eyes and the curly hair that fell to his collar. His pointed mustachios were painted gold. His clothes were all shades of yellow; a foam of Myrish lace the color of butter spilled from his collar and cuffs, his doublet was sewn with brass medallions in the shape of dandelions, and ornamental goldwork crawled up his high leather boots to his thighs. Gloves of soft yellow suede were tucked into a belt of gilded rings, and his fingernails were enameled blue.</div>

It is true that you committed savageries in Astapor, but we Yunkai'i are a most forgiving people. Your quarrel is not with us, Your Grace. Why squander your strength against our mighty walls when you will need every man to regain your father's throne in far Westeros? Yunkai wishes you only well in that endeavor. And to prove the truth of that, I have brought you a gift." He clapped his hands, and two of his escort came forward bearing a heavy cedar chest bound in bronze and gold. They set it at her feet. "Fifty thousand golden marks," Grazdan said smoothly. "Yours, as a gesture of friendship from the Wise Masters of Yunkai. Gold given freely is better than plunder bought with blood, surely? So I say to you, Daenerys Targaryen, take this chest, and go."</div>

The Tyroshi was fair where Ser Jorah was swarthy; lithe where the knight was brawny; graced with flowing locks where the other was balding, yet smooth-skinned where Mormont was hairy.
