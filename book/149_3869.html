<div class="line_en">It happened every year, was almost a ritual. And this was his eighty-second birthday. When, as usual, the flower was delivered, he took off the wrapping paper and then picked up the telephone to call Detective Superintendent Morell who, when he retired, had moved to Lake Siljan in Dalarna. They were not only the same age, they had been born on the same day -- which was something of an irony under the circumstances. The old policeman was sitting with his coffee, waiting, expecting the call.</div>

<div class="line_en">With that, the subject was exhausted, and not another word was exchanged for almost a minute. The retired policeman leaned back in his kitchen chair and drew on his pipe. He knew he was no longer expected to come up with a pithy comment or any sharp question which would shed a new light on the case. Those days had long since passed, and the exchange between the two men seemed like a ritual attaching to a mystery which no-one else in the whole world had the least interest in unravelling.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="说完，话题就这么结束了，两人将近一分钟没交谈。退休警官往后靠坐在厨房椅子上，抽着烟斗。他知道对方已不期望他发表任何可能为本案开启一线曙光的简要评论或锋利问题。那样的日子早已过去，如今两人的对话仿佛一场谜样的仪式，只是这世上除了他们之外，没人有兴趣去解开这个谜。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Latin name was Leptospermum (Myrtaceae) rubinette. It was a plant about four inches high with small, heather-like foliage and a white flower with five petals about one inch across.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那花的拉丁学名是Leptospermum rubinette（属桃金娘科），是一种高约十公分的植物，有石南状的小叶和一朵五瓣白花，花瓣还不到两公分宽。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The plant was native to the Australian bush and uplands, where it was to be found among tussocks of grass. There it was called Desert Snow. Someone at the botanical gardens in Uppsala would later confirm that it was a plant seldom cultivated in Sweden. The botanist wrote in her report that it was related to the tea tree and that it was sometimes confused with its more common cousin Leptospermum scoparium, which grew in abundance in New Zealand. What distinguished them, she pointed out, was that rubinette had a small number of microscopic pink dots at the tips of the petals, giving the flower a faint pinkish tinge.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这植物原产于澳大利亚丛林与高地，多半生长于草丛间，当地人称之为“沙漠雪”。后来，乌普萨拉植物园的人也证实这种植物在瑞典很少见。这位植物学家在报告中写道，该植物与茶树属性相近，常被误认为另一种较常见、主要产于新西兰的同类植物松红梅（Leptospermum scoparium）。她指出两者的差异在于前者花瓣末稍有少许粉红小点，因此花朵略带着红色调。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Rubinette was altogether an unpretentious flower. It had no known medicinal properties, and it could not induce hallucinatory experiences. It was neither edible, nor had a use in the manufacture of plant dyes. On the other hand, the aboriginal people of Australia regarded as sacred the region and the flora around Ayers Rock.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“沙漠雪”完全是一种含蓄的花，没有医药特性、无法引发幻觉，不能食用也不能用来制造植物染料。但另一方面，澳大利亚原住民却将艾尔斯岩①遭地区与该区的植物群视为神圣的象征。【注：①艾尔斯岩（Ayers Rock），位于澳大利亚中部沙漠，是世界上最大的单一岩石。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The botanist said that she herself had never seen one before, but after consulting her colleagues she was to report that attempts had been made to introduce the plant at a nursery in Göteborg, and that it might, of course, be cultivated by amateur botanists. It was difficult to grow in Sweden because it thrived in a dry climate and had to remain indoors half of the year. It would not thrive in calcareous soil and it had to be watered from below. It needed pampering.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那名植物学家说她从未亲眼见过这种植物，但询问同僚后得知哥德堡某处温室曾试图引进，培植者当然可能是业余植物学家。这种植物在瑞典种植困难的原因是它适合生长在干燥气候，而且大半年都得养在室内，种在石灰土壤里很难长得好，还必须从底部浇水，是种需要娇宠的植物。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The fact of its being so rare a flower ought to have made it easier to trace the source of this particular specimen, but in practice it was an impossible task. There was no registry to look it up in, no licences to explore. Anywhere from a handful to a few hundred enthusiasts could have had access to seeds or plants. And those could have changed hands between friends or been bought by mail order from anywhere in Europe, anywhere in the Antipodes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="既是如此罕见的花，要追查样本来源理应不难，但实际上却是不可能的任务，因为既无登记数据也无执照可查。有兴趣去取得种子或植物的人少则数人，多则数百人，也许是朋友间易手，或是从欧洲或澳大利亚某个角落邮购所得。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But it was only one in the series of mystifying flowers that each year arrived by post on the first day of November. They were always beautiful and for the most part rare flowers, always pressed, mounted on water-colour paper in a simple frame measuring six inches by eleven inches.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但这只是每年十一月第一天寄来的一连串故弄玄虚的花之一。这些花都很美，而且大多十分罕见，总是制成压花后贴在水彩纸上，用一个六乘十一寸、样式简单的框裱起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The strange story of the flowers had never been reported in the press; only a very few people knew of it. Thirty years ago the regular arrival of the flower was the object of much scrutiny -- at the National Forensic Laboratory, among fingerprint experts, graphologists, criminal investigators, and one or two relatives and friends of the recipient. Now the actors in the drama were but three: the elderly birthday boy, the retired police detective, and the person who had posted the flower. The first two at least had reached such an age that the group of interested parties would soon be further diminished.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这则奇怪的花故事从未见过报，只有少数人知情。三十年前，国家刑事鉴识实验室里的指纹专家、笔迹专家、刑事调查员，以及收件人的一两位亲友，都曾非常缜密地调查这件定期收到花的事。如今这出戏的演员只剩三人：上了年纪的寿星、退休的警探与寄花人。至少前两人已到达一定年纪，因此相关人士的数目不久又会减少。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The policeman was a hardened veteran. He would never forget his first case, in which he had had to take into custody a violent and appallingly drunk worker at an electrical substation before he caused others harm. During his career he had brought in poachers, wife beaters, con men, car thieves, and drunk drivers. He had dealt with burglars, drug dealers, rapists, and one deranged bomber. He had been involved in nine murder or manslaughter cases. In five of these the murderer had called the police himself and, full of remorse, confessed to having killed his wife or brother or some other relative. Two others were solved within a few days. Another required the assistance of the National Criminal Police and took two years.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="退休警探是个硬汉。他永远不会忘记自己办的第一宗案子，那次他不得不逮捕一个喝得醉醺醺又有暴力倾向的变电所工人，以免他伤人。在整个警察生涯中，他曾抓过盗猎者、殴妻者、欺诈犯、偷车贼与酒醉驾驶员，也曾经和窃贼、毒贩、强暴犯，还有一名疯狂炸弹客周旋过。他曾参与侦办九起谋杀或杀人案，其中五起都是凶手主动打电话给警方，充满悔意地坦承杀了自己的妻子或兄弟或其他亲人。另外两起都在几日内侦破。另一起则求助于国家刑警队，花了两年时间才破。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The ninth case was solved to the police's satisfaction, which is to say that they knew who the murderer was, but because the evidence was so insubstantial the public prosecutor decided not to proceed with the case. To the detective superintendent's dismay, the statute of limitations eventually put an end to the matter. But all in all he could look back on an impressive career.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="至于第九起案子也算是破得让警方满意，也就是说他们知道凶手是谁，但由于证据太薄弱，公诉检察官决定不予起诉。令侦查警探气馁的是，案子终究因为过了法定追诉期而不了了之。不过总体回顾起来，这段警察生涯还是有声有色。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was anything but pleased.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但他却不满意。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For the detective, the "Case of the Pressed Flowers" had been nagging at him for years -- his last, unsolved, and frustrating case. The situation was doubly absurd because after spending literally thousands of hours brooding, on duty and off, he could not say beyond doubt that a crime had indeed been committed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对这位警探来说，“压花案”已令他苦恼多年，这是他最后一宗案子，却因未能侦破而令他十分沮丧。更荒谬的是，无论在不在执勤，他日夜苦思了数千小时，仍无法斩钉截铁地说这的确是一起犯罪事件。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The two men knew that whoever had mounted the flowers would have worn gloves, that there would be no fingerprints on the frame or the glass. The frame could have been bought in camera shops or stationery stores the world over. There was, quite simply, no lead to follow. Most often the parcel was posted in Stockholm, but three times from London, twice from Paris, twice from Copenhagen, once from Madrid, once from Bonn, and once from Pensacola, Florida. The detective superintendent had had to look it up in an atlas.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他二人都知道为花裱框的人会戴手套，所以框或玻璃上不会留下指纹。框可能是在世界各地的相馆或文具店买来的，根本无迹可循。包裹最常从斯德哥尔摩寄出，但也有三次从伦敦、两次从巴黎、两次从哥本哈根、一次从马德里、一次从波恩，甚至有一次从佛罗里达的彭萨科拉，警探还得去查地图才知道。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After putting down the telephone the eighty-two-year-old birthday boy sat for a long time looking at the pretty but meaningless flower whose name he did not yet know. Then he looked up at the wall above his desk. There hung forty-three pressed flowers in their frames. Four rows of ten, and one at the bottom with four. In the top row one was missing from the ninth slot. Desert Snow would be number forty-four.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="挂断电话后，八十二岁的寿星盯着那美丽却毫无意义的花呆坐许久，他连花名都还不知道。接着他抬头望向书桌上方的墙面，那里已挂着四十三幅裱框的压花，每排十幅，共有四排，而最后第五排只有四幅。最上方一排第九个位置有个缺口。“沙漠雪”是第四十四号。">查看中文翻译</div>
