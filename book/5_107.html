<div class="line_en">Kate smiled and stepped cautiously down the ladder. They were in the downstairs bedroom of the houseboat, readying the nursery. She could tell that Tully was about thirty seconds away from throwing the screwdriver at the freshly painted wall. "Let me look at the sheet."</div>

<div class="line_en">Tully grinned at her. "My deepest apologies for that, but you'll notice that I have no bun in the oven. I don't believe I'm within eight hundred miles of a bun, in fact. So, not only can I have a margarita, but after putting together that crib -- a job which, I might add, is totally Johnny's and in fact required a scrotum to complete in less than a full day -- I deserve a margarita. And you, O fattening one, can have a virgin drink. Ironic, don't you think?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="塔莉笑嘻嘻地看着她，“真是万分遗憾，不过呢，你应该看得出来，我的肚子里没宝宝，老实说，我想很可能短期之内都不可能有，所以啦，我当然可以喝玛格丽特，更何况，我才刚组好那个婴儿床，替强尼解决了他的工作，完成了连男人也得耗上一整天的苦工，因此我绝对有资格来一杯玛格丽特。至于你呢，发胖的夫人，可以来杯无酒精的处女玛格丽特，你不觉得很讽刺吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I can't drink. You know that."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你知道我不能喝酒。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What's it like," Tully asked when Kate got up to put a log on the fire, "being married?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凯蒂站起来替壁炉添柴，塔莉问：“结婚是什么感觉？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tully put an arm around her. "Thankfully you'll never have to know. Come on, I'm making margaritas."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="塔莉搂着她，“幸好你永远不必烦恼这个问题。来吧，我来弄两杯玛格丽特。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, it's only been three months, so I'm hardly an expert, but so far it's great." She sat back down and put her feet on the coffee table, resting her hand on the barely noticeable bump of her stomach. "You'll think I'm crazy, but I love the routine, the way we have breakfast together, each reading our own stuff; I love that he's the first person I see every morning and that he kisses me goodnight before I fall asleep." She smiled at Tully. "But I miss sharing a bathroom with you. He's constantly moving my stuff and putting it away -- and then he forgets where he put it. How about you, Tully? How's life in our old apartment?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我才结婚三个月，所以不算是专家，但目前感觉很不错。”她重新坐下，脚架在茶几上，一手放在还很小的肚子上，“你一定觉得我疯了，但我很爱这种规律的生活，一起吃早餐，在餐桌上各自读着书报资料；每天早上一睁开眼就看见他，睡觉前他吻我道晚安，我喜欢这种感觉。”她对塔莉微笑，“不过我想念以前和你共享浴室的时候，他每次都把我的东西乱拿乱放，然后忘记放在哪里。你呢，塔莉？你一个人住我们的旧公寓还习惯吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Arm in arm, they went to the kitchen and made the drinks. All the way there, and back to the living room, where they sat in front of the fire, they talked. About little things, mostly -- the speeding ticket Tully got last week, Sean's new girlfriend, the class Mom was taking at the local community college.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她们勾着手臂进厨房调酒，然后坐在客厅壁炉前，嘴一直没停过，大致上聊些日常小事，例如塔莉上星期超速被开罚单、尚恩的新女友，以及妈妈在小区大学修的课。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This was the subject Kate had tried to avoid. She'd known what she wanted to do from the moment Johnny had married her, but she hadn't had the courage to tell Tully. She took a deep breath. "I'm quitting."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凯蒂一直逃避这个话题，与强尼成婚的那一刻她就知道想怎么做，但没有勇气告诉塔莉。“我打算辞职。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Lonely," Tully said, shrugging and smiling as if she didn't care. "I'm getting used to it again."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“有点寂寞。”塔莉耸肩微笑，表现得一派潇洒，“我又重新开始适应了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"And I do." Tully laughed and poured herself a second margarita. "Have you guys figured out the plan for life after my godchild's birth? Will they let you have a few weeks off?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我知道，所以拼命打。”塔莉大笑着倒了第二杯玛格丽特，“你们想好孩子出生之后要怎么安排了吗？公司会让你休几个星期的产假吧？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What? Why? They've got you on the best accounts, and you and Johnny are making good money. It's 1987 for crying out loud. You don't have to quit your job to be a mother. You can hire a nanny."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“什么？为什么？你负责的客户都是一流厂商，而且你和强尼的收入加在一起很可观。拜托，都已经1987年了，你不必为了孩子辞职，可以请保姆啊。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Tully immediately launched into a hilarious story about her most recent assignment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="塔莉立刻说起最近采访时发生的趣事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"And you think that will be enough for you -- carpools and field trips and classroom-volunteering?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“接送孩子、校外教学、义工妈妈，你真的可以满足于这种生活？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"My mom went on every field trip I ever took. She was a helper in the classroom every year until I begged her to please stop coming. I didn't take the bus until I was in junior high and still remember talking to my mom on the ride home after school. I want my child to have all that. I can always go back to work later."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“从小每次校外教学我妈都会跟去，每年级她都来教室当义工妈妈，直到我哀求她不要来；上初中之前我没有坐过校车，我到现在都还记得放学后在车上和妈妈说话的感觉。我希望我的孩子也能拥有这些，我可以晚一点再回职场。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"If it's not, I'll find something else. Come on, it's not like I'm an astronaut." She smiled. "So, tell me about your job. I'll live vicariously through you, so make the stories good."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“如果不行，我会找新工作，拜托，我又不是航天员。”她微笑，“好啦，跟我说说你的工作吧。我要透过你感受职场生活，所以说得精彩一点。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Tully got to her feet so quickly, she knocked over her margarita. She put an arm around Kate, steadying her. "I'm right here."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="塔莉急忙跳起来，甚至打翻了酒，她搀扶着凯蒂站稳，“我在这里。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I was not," Kate said quickly, but the truth was that she did feel drowsy, kind of light-headed, too. "I think I need a cup of tea." She stood up and swayed precariously, reaching out for the back of the couch. "Wow, that was --" In the middle of her sentence, she looked at Tully and frowned. "Tully?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“才没有呢。”凯蒂连忙否认，但事实上她确实有点困倦，感觉昏沉沉。“我好像需要来杯茶。”她站起身，却一阵天旋地转，她连忙抓住沙发椅背。“哇，怎么回事——”说到一半，她皱着眉头看塔莉，“塔莉？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Something was wrong; a wave of dizziness struck her so hard and suddenly that she stumbled.</div>

<div class="line_en">A dark pool of blood stained the cushion and splattered the decking at her feet. "Oh, no," she whispered, touching her stomach. She wanted to say more, pray to God to for help, but while she was grasping for words, the world tilted sickeningly and she passed out.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="凯蒂虽然有意识，但非常模糊。她的肤色极为苍白，如同洗过太多次的旧床单，就连平时明亮的绿眸都变得茫然无神，泪水不断滑落太阳穴。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="救护车停在医院前，医护人员急忙将凯蒂搬下车，推进灯火通明的医院，塔莉被推到一边。她站在敞开的门口，看着好姐妹被送走，霎时间，她意识到状况有多严重。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Four months isn't early, Tully," Mrs. Mularkey said quietly. "And people who haven't had a miscarriage always say that. It was what Bud said to me. Twice." She looked up. "It never felt like much of a blessing to me. It felt like losing someone I loved. You know about that, don't you?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“四个月不算初期了，塔莉。”穆勒齐伯母轻声说，“没有流产经验的人总会那么说，巴德以前也那么对我说，而且还两次。”她抬起头，“我不觉得有什么幸好，我只觉得失去了所爱，你懂那种感觉吧？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tully came up beside her, touched her shoulder. "I brought you some coffee." She let her hand rest on Mrs. M.'s shoulder.

Everything about him looked disheveled -- his unshaven face was a contrasting palette of pale skin and stubbly black beard, his hair was a long, tangled black mess, and his eyes bespoke a bone-deep exhaustion. His Levi's were torn and dirty, his khaki shirt had more wrinkles than an unmade bed. "I hired a private plane. It's going to be a hell of a Visa bill."</div>

<div class="line_en">They took turns being with Kate during the next few days. On Thursday, it was Tully's time. She called in sick at work and spent the day with Kate. They played cards and watched television and talked. Most of the time, to be honest, Tully just listened. When it was her turn to answer, she tried to say the right thing, but she was pretty sure she failed more often than not. There was a sadness in her friend now, a graying around the edges that was so foreign Tully felt as if she'd stumbled upon some negative version of their friendship. Nothing she said was quite right.</div>

And she couldn't wait. When she'd paid her dues, she'd get a real story to cover, and when she finally got that break, she'd knock it out of the park. Truthfully, when she watched people like Pauley and Bryant Gumbel, she knew how far she had to go. They were gods in her eyes, and she spent every spare minute watching how they did their jobs.

<div class="line_en">Eighteen hour workdays didn't leave her much time for a personal life but she still had Katie, even with all the miles between them. They spoke at least twice a week, and every Sunday Tully called Mrs. M. She told them both stories about work pressures and celebrity sightings and life in Manhattan; they responded with details about the new house Kate and Johnny had bought, the trip Mr. and Mrs. M. had planned for the spring, and -- best of all -- the news that Kate was pregnant again and it was going well.</div>
