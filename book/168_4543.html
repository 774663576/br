<div class="line_en">By sunset they were at the top, making camp where no harm could come to them. Arya walked around the circle of weirwood stumps with Lord Beric's squire Ned, and they stood on top of one watching the last light fade in the west. From up here she could see a storm raging to the north, but High Heart stood above the rain. It wasn't above the wind, though; the gusts were blowing so strongly that it felt like someone was behind her, yanking on her cloak. Only when she turned, no one was there.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="日落时分，他们登上峰顶，在这所谓“不会受伤害”的地方扎营。艾莉亚跟贝里伯爵的侍从艾德一起绕鱼梁木树墩行走，后来又并肩站在其中一个树墩上注视着西方最后一缕光线褪去。从此高处，她看到北方有团汹涌的风暴，但高尚之心矗立在冰雨上方。然而它并不能凌驾于风之上，阵风猛烈吹拂，好似有人在拉扯她的斗篷，只是转身望去，根本毫无人影。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I had a gift for tongues, though. And when I gazed into the flames, well, from time to time I saw things. Even so, I was more bother than I was worth, so they sent me finally to King's Landing to bring the Lord's light to seven-besotted Westeros. King Aerys so loved fire it was thought he might make a convert. Alas, his pyromancers knew better tricks than I did.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“然而我很有语言天赋，而且盯着圣火看的时候，呃，有时会看见某些东西。尽管如此，仍旧算个累赘，没有太大价值，因此才被他们送去君临，负责将光之王的信仰传播到沉迷于七神的维斯特洛。他们认为伊里斯国王这么喜欢火，也许有机可趁，只可惜，那帮火术士的伎俩比我高明。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Just so. He charged me twice what they were worth, then scolded me for setting them afire." Thoros laughed. "Your master had it right. I was no very holy priest. I was born youngest of eight, so my father gave me over to the Red Temple, but it was not the path I would have chosen. I prayed the prayers and I spoke the spells, but I would also lead raids on the kitchens, and from time to time they found girls in my bed. Such wicked girls, I never knew how they got there.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“就是这样。他收我两倍价格，然后骂我将它们点燃。”索罗斯哈哈大笑，“你师傅说得对，我不是什么正派牧师，作为八个孩子中最小的一个，被父亲给了红神庙，并非我自己选择的道路。我颂读祷词，学习法术，但也常带头扫荡厨房，还教人不时发现床上藏有女孩。真淘气的女孩，我从不知她们是怎么跑上床的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">That night the wind was howling almost like a wolf and there were some real wolves off to the west giving it lessons. Notch, Anguy, and Merrit oMoontown had the watch. Ned, Gendry, and many of the others were fast asleep when Arya spied the small pale shape creeping behind the horses, thin white hair flying wild as she leaned upon a gnarled cane. The woman could not have been more than three feet tall. The firelight made her eyes gleam as red as the eyes of Jon's wolf. He was a ghost too. Arya stole closer, and knelt to watch.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I dreamt a wolf howling in the rain, but no one heard his grief," the dwarf woman was saying. "I dreamt such a clangor I thought my head might burst, drums and horns and pipes and screams, but the saddest sound was the little bells. I dreamt of a maid at a feast with purple serpents in her hair, venom dripping from their fangs. And later I dreamt that maid again, slaying a savage giant in a castle built of snow." She turned her head sharply and smiled through the gloom, right at Arya. "You cannot hide from me, child. Come closer, now."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我梦到一头狼在雨中嗥叫，但无人倾听他的不幸，”矮个女人续道，“我梦到一阵刺耳的喧闹，闹得头都快炸了，其中有鼓点、号角、笛子及尖叫，但最悲哀的是小铃铛的声响。我梦到一位少女参加宴会，她头发里有紫色的毒蛇，致命的汁液从它们牙齿上滴落。稍后，我又梦到那位少女在冰雪城堡外杀了一个无敌的巨人。”她突然转头，朝黑暗中的艾莉亚微笑，“在我面前藏不住的，孩子。走近些，快点。”">查看中文翻译</div>

This place belongs to the old gods still… they linger here as I do, shrunken and feeble but not yet dead. Nor do they love the flames.

Arya could not make out what they were saying, but the singer kept glancing at her, and one time Lem got so angry he pounded a fist against the wall. That was when Lord Beric gestured for her to come closer. It was the last thing she wanted to do, but Harwin put a hand in the small of her back and pushed her forward. She took two steps and hesitated, full of dread. "My lord." She waited to hear what Lord Beric would say.</div>

<div class="line_en">Outside the stables the rain was still falling, and distant lightning flashed in the west. Arya ran as fast as she could. She did not know where she was going, only that she wanted to be alone, away from all the voices, away from their hollow words and broken promises. All I wanted was to go to Riverrun. It was her own fault, for taking Gendry and Hot Pie with her when she left Harrenhal. She would have been better alone. If she had been alone, the outlaws would never have caught her, and she'd be with Robb and her mother by now. They were never my pack. If they had been, they wouldn't leave me. She splashed through a puddle of muddy water. Someone was shouting her name, Harwin probably, or Gendry, but the thunder drowned them out as it rolled across the hills, half a heartbeat behind the lightning. The lightning lord, she thought angrily. Maybe he couldn't die, but he could lie.</div>
