<div class="line_en">It was a Sunday morning in late October about four months after Tess's arrival at Trantridge, and a few weeks after the night ride in The Chase. Carrying a heavy basket and bundle, Tess was walking towards the hills which divided her from the Vale, her place of birth. The scenery and people on this side were very different from those in her village. Marlott people mainly thought and travelled northward and westward, while on this side people were interested in the east and the south. She walked up the same hill which D'Urberville had driven down so wildly that June day. On reaching the top of the hill, Tess paused and looked for a long time at the familiar green world of home. It was always beautiful from here, but since she had last seen it, her view of life had changed. She had learnt that wickedness exists, even where there is beauty, and now she could hardly bear to look down into the Vale.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the next few weeks, however, she became more cheerful, and went to church one Sunday morning. She loved listening to the well-known tunes, and gave herself up to the beauty of the music. She wondered at the composer's power. From the grave he could make a girl like her, who had never known him, feel extremes of emotion. She sat in a quiet, dark corner listening to the service. But when the village people arrived at church they noticed her and started whispering to each other. She knew what they were saying and realized she could come to church no more.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而接下来的几个星期，她变得稍稍振作一点了。一个星期天的上午，她去了教堂。她喜欢听那些熟悉的旋律，沉浸在那美妙的音乐中。她对作曲家的力量感到惊叹。他虽已在坟墓当中，却能让一个像她这样与他素不相识的姑娘感受无限的激情。她坐在一个安静、黑暗的角落里，倾听基督仪式和音乐。但是当村子里的人们来到教堂后，他们注意到了她并窃窃私语起来。她知道他们在说什么，同时知道自己今后再也不能来教堂了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So she spent almost all her time in her bedroom, which she shared with the children. From here she watched the wind, the snow, the rain, beautiful sunsets and full moons, one after another. People began to think she had gone away. She only went out after dark, to walk in the woods and the fields. She was not afraid of the dark or the shadows; it was people she was anxious to avoid. She was at home on the lonely hills, but she felt guilty surrounded by innocent nature. When it rained, she thought nature was crying at her weakness, and when the midnight wind blew she thought nature was angry with her. But she did not realize that although she had broken an accepted social rule, she had done nothing against nature. She was as innocent as the sleeping birds in the trees, or the small field animals in the hedges.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因此，她把自己整天关在这间与其他孩子们共有的卧室里。在这儿，她看刮风，看下雪，看雨点飘洒，看美丽的日落，还有一轮又一轮的满月。人们渐渐以为她外出了。只有在天黑以后，她才会出来，到树林里和田野上走走。她不怕黑暗和阴影，她极力想避开的只是人群。在孤寂的山上她感到自在，但被纯净的大自然包围时，她又有一种负罪感。下雨时，她会想到是大自然在为她的软弱而哭泣；而午夜的狂风又让她觉得大自然在生她的气。她没有意识到，虽然她触犯了一条公认的社会戒律，但她却从没违反过自然。她就像树林里熟睡的鸟儿或树篱下的田间小动物一样清白无辜。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">One day in August the sun was rising through the mist. In a yellow cornfield near Marlott village it shone on two large arms of painted wood. These, with two others below, formed the turning cross of the reaping-machine. It was ready for today's harvest. A group of men and a group of women came down the road at sunrise. As they walked along, their heads were in the sun while their feet were in the shadow of the hedge. They went into the field.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="8月的一天，太阳正从薄雾中缓缓升起。在马勒特村附近的一片金黄的麦地上，阳光正照射着两根漆过的木头。这两根，加上下面的两根，就组成了割麦机上转动的十字形曲柄。这是在为今天的收割做准备。日出时分，一群男人和女人沿着大路走来了。他们的脸沐浴在阳光中，脚则落在了树篱的阴影里。他们走进了麦地。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The harvesters followed the machine, picking and tying up bundles of corn. The girls were perhaps more interesting to look at. They wore large cotton hats to keep off the sun, and gloves to protect their hands from the corn. The prettiest was the one in the pale pink jacket, who never looked around her as she worked. She moved forward, bending and tying like a machine. Occasionally she stood up to rest. Then her face could be seen: a lovely young face, with deep dark eyes and long heavy curling hair. Her cheeks were paler, her teeth more regular, and her red lips thinner than most country girls.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="收割者们跟着机器走，把麦子拾起并扎成一捆一捆。也许姑娘们看起来更有趣了。她们戴着宽边的棉布帽子以免阳光灼伤了脸，还戴着手套以防麦子刮破了手。其中最漂亮的要数那位穿着浅粉色短外套的姑娘。她干活时从不四处张望。她朝前面移动着，俯身捆扎，就像一台机器。偶尔她站直身子歇一会儿，这时你就可以看见她的脸了：这是一张年轻可爱的脸庞，嵌着一双幽深的眼睛。她还有一头又长又密的卷发。比起大多数乡下姑娘来，她的脸色更白晰，她的牙齿更整齐，她的红唇也更薄一些。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Soon there came a sound like the love-making of the grasshopper. The machine had begun, and three horses pulled it slowly along the field. Its arms turned, bright in the sunlight. Gradually the area of standing corn was reduced. So was the living space of the small field animals, who crowded together, not knowing that they could not escape the machine in the end.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="很快传来一种蚱蜢求爱时发出的声音。机器开始运转了。有三匹马拉着它慢慢地往前开。机器的曲柄转动着，在阳光下闪闪发光。渐渐地，麦地里竖着麦子的部分减少了。田间小动物们的生存空间同样也就减少了。它们簇拥在一起，并不知道它们终究是无法从机器下逃生的。">查看中文翻译</div>
