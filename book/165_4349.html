<div class="line_en">Back to the coordinates. Many sets of coordinates flitted across space, like the matrix insects flitting across the sky of the home world. Picking up coordinates was the job of the main core, which swallowed all the messages passing through space: medium membrane, long membrane, light membrane, and maybe one day even short membrane. The main core remembered the positions of all the stars. By matching the received data against various map projections and position schema, it could pick out the coordinates of the messages' origin. It was said that the main core could match position schema from five hundred million time grains ago. Singer never tried anything like that -- it would be meaningless. In that distant age, the low-entropy clusters in space were rare and far apart, and had not evolved the hiding gene and the cleansing gene. But now -- Hide yourself well; cleanse well.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sincere coordinates followed certain patterns. For instance, a mass cluster of coordinates was usually insincere. But these patterns were all only heuristics. Judging the sincerity of coordinates effectively required intuition. The main core on this seed was incapable of this task, and even the supercore back on the home world could not do it. This was one reason why low-entropy entities had no substitute.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="判断坐标的诚意有一些可遵循的规律，比如群发的坐标往往都没有诚意。但这些规律都是很粗略的，要想真正有效地判断坐标的诚意，主要靠直觉，这一点种子上的主核做不到。甚至母世界的超核也做不到，这就是低嫡体不可取代之处。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Out of all the coordinates, only some were sincere. Believing in insincere coordinates meant cleansing empty worlds. This was wasteful. And there were other harms besides.

<div class="line_en">Singer had this skill, this intuition, but it wasn't a gift or instinct; rather, it was something honed by the accumulated experience of tens of thousands of time grains.

<div class="line_en">Just then, Singer noticed a sincere set of coordinates near the course of the seed. The set of coordinates was broadcast by long membrane, and even Singer himself couldn't be sure what told him that the set of coordinates was sincere -- intuition could not always be explained. He decided to cleanse it. He wasn't busy, and the task wasn't going to distract him from singing. Even if he got it wrong, it was not a big deal. Cleansing was not a precision task and didn't require absolute accuracy. It also wasn't urgent. He just had to get it done eventually. This was also why his position wasn't prestigious.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="正在这时，歌者看到了一个有诚意的坐标，就在种子航线附近。这是一个用长膜广播的坐标，歌者也不知道自己为什么断定它有诚意，直觉是说不清的。他决定清理一下，反正现在也没有更多的事情可做，这事也不影响他正唱着的歌谣。他判断错了也没关系，清理就是这样，不是一件精确的工作，不要求绝对准确。这也不是急迫的工作，早晚做了就行。这也是这一岗位地位低的原因。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For instance, how many reference points were taken? What was the method for marking the target star? And many other subtle details besides. The main core was able to provide some information, such as the historical records associated with this set of coordinates, the direction of the coordinate broadcast source, the broadcast time, and so forth. Together, these formed an organic whole, and what emerged in Singer's consciousness was a sense of the coordinate broadcaster himself. Singer's spirit crossed the chasm of space and time, resonated with the spirit of the broadcaster, and felt its terror and anxiety, along with other feelings unfamiliar to the home world, such as hatred, envy, greed, and so on. But for the most part, it was terror. Terror was what endowed a set of coordinates with sincerity. For all low-entropy entities, terror guaranteed existence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="比如取点的多少，目标星星的标注方式等等，还有一些更微妙的细节。当然，主核也会提供一些相关信息，比如与该坐标有关的历史记录，坐标广播源的方向和广播时间等。这些合而成为一个有机的整体，在歌者的意识中浮现出来的将是坐标广播者本身。歌者的精神越过空间和时间的沟壑，与广播者的精神产生共振，感受它的恐俱和焦虑。还有一些母世界不太熟悉的感情，如仇恨、嫉妒和贪婪等。但主要还是恐俱，有了恐惧，坐标就有了诚意——对于所有低熵体，恐惧是生存的保证。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Singer soon understood why the cleansing had happened so fast. He saw a slow fog in the vicinity of that destroyed world. The slow fog was about half a structure length away from that world. Seen by itself, it wasn't apparent where the fog had come from, but when connected with the broadcast coordinates, it was obvious that the fog belonged to that world. The slow fog showed that the world was dangerous, which was why the cleansing had come so quickly. It appeared that there were other low-entropy entities with even sharper intuition than he; but that wasn't strange. It was as the Elder said: In the cosmos, no matter how fast you are, someone will be faster; no matter how slow you are, someone will be slower.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="歌者很快知道为什么清理来得这么快。他看到了那个世界附近的那一片慢雾，慢雾距那个世界约半个构造长度，如果单独看它，确实难以判断其来源，但与被广播的坐标联系起来，一眼就看出它是属于那个世界的。慢雾表明那是个危险的世界，所以清理来得很快。看来有比自己直觉更敏锐的低熵体。这不奇怪，正如长老所说，在宇宙中，你再快都有比你快的，你再慢也有比你慢的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Every set of broadcast coordinates would eventually be cleansed; it was just a matter of sooner versus later. One low-entropy entity might think this set of coordinates insincere, but on the millions upon millions of low-entropy worlds there were billions upon billions tasked with cleansing -- someone would think it sincere. All low-entropy entities possessed the cleansing gene, and cleansing was an instinct. Also, cleansing was a very simple thing. The cosmos was full of sources of potential power -- one just had to trigger them to complete the task. It required so very little, and didn't even delay singing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一般来说，被广播的单个坐标最终都会被清理，只是时间早晚的问题。你可能认为这个坐标没诚意，但在亿万个低熵世界中有亿万万个清理员，总有认为它有诚意的。低熵体都有清理基因，清理是它们的本能。再说清理只是一件很简单的事，宇宙中到处都有潜在的力量，只需诱发它们为你做事就行了，几乎不耗费什么，也不耽误唱歌。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">If Singer were patient, all sincere coordinates would eventually be cleansed by other, unknown low-entropy entities. But this was not a good thing for either the home world or the seed. Since Singer had received the set of coordinates and even glanced at the world pointed to by the coordinates, Singer had a connection to that world. It would be naïve to think of this connection as unidirectional. Recall the great law of reversible discovery: If you could see a low-entropy world, then that low-entropy world could also see you -- it was only a matter of time. Thus, waiting for others to complete cleansing was dangerous.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果歌者有耐心等待，诚意坐标最后都会被其他未知的低嫡体清理，但这样对母世界和种子都不利，毕竟他收到了坐标，还向坐标所指的世界看了一眼，这就与那个世界建立了某种联系。如果认为这种联系是单向的那就太幼稚了，要记住伟大的探知可逆定律：如果你能看到一个低墒世界，那个低嫡世界迟早也能看到你，只是时间问题。所以，什么事情都等别人做是危险的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Among the "personal effects" was something that piqued Singer's interest. It was a record of the dead world's three communications with another location using medium membrane. Medium membrane was the least efficient communication membrane, also called primitive membrane. Most communications preferred long membrane, though it was said that even short membrane could be used to convey messages. If true, that would make the communicators akin to gods. But Singer liked primitive membrane. He thought primitive membrane possessed a simple beauty, symbolizing an age full of joy. He often turned primitive membrane messages into songs. He thought they sounded pretty, even if he didn't understand them. Understanding them wasn't necessary, however; other than coordinates, primitive membrane messages didn't have much useful information. It was enough to enjoy the music.</div>

<div class="line_en">Singer had indeed heard of low-entropy worlds that possessed neither the hiding gene nor the hiding instinct, but this was the first time he had seen one.

If the distance were fairly large, it wouldn't be a big deal either; but the distance was very short, only 416 structures -- the two worlds were practically on top of each other.

<div class="line_en">However, as applied to this particular case, the situation was more complicated. The first three communications were followed nine time grains later by the coordinate broadcast. Then, sixty time grains after that, there was another long-membrane coordinate broadcast from somewhere else, pointing at the dead three-star world. The chain of events painted an uneasy picture, a picture that indicated danger. The cleansing against the dead three-star world had happened twelve time grains ago, so the Star-Pluckers must have realized that their own position had been revealed. Their only choice was to shroud themselves in slow fog so that they would appear perfectly safe and no one would bother them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但具体到这一个，更复杂一些。前面的三次通信，加上又一次的坐标广播，再到六十个时间颗粒后，对死者的那次来自别处的长膜坐标广播。这一连串事件构成了一个不祥的图景，昭示着危险。对死者的清除已经过去了十二个时间颗粒。弹星者应该意识到自己的坐标已经暴露，那此时1以上内容见《三体》及《三体II·黑暗森林》唯一的选择就是把自己裹在慢雾中，让自己看上去是安全的，那样便没人会去理他们。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Singer gazed at the world of the Star-Pluckers. It was an ordinary star that had at least a billion more time grains of life left.

<div class="line_en">The only thing left was cleansing. Singer took a mass dot out of the magazine again, then realized that he couldn't use a mass dot to cleanse the Star-Pluckers. Their planetary system had a different structure than the dead world's system: it possessed blind corners. Using a mass dot might leave something behind, thereby wasting effort. He needed to use a dual-vector foil. However, Singer didn't have the authority to retrieve a dual-vector foil out of the magazine; he had to ask the Elder for approval.</div>

<div class="line_en">The dual-vector foil drifted in front of Singer. It was sealed in its package, crystal clear. Although it was an ordinary object, Singer liked it a lot.
