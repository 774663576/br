<div class="line_cn" title="罗莎莉女神般的脸庞带着沾沾自喜的古怪表情，她走到贾斯帕面前——小心翼翼地与他的牙齿保持一定的距离——帮助埃美特把他拖出埃斯梅为他们打开的门，埃斯梅一直用手捂着自己的嘴巴和鼻子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He shook his head. "Too much glass in the wound." He reached over and ripped a long, thin scrap from the bottom of the white tablecloth. He twisted it around my arm above the elbow to form a tourniquet. The smell of the blood was making me dizzy. My ears rang.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他摇了摇头“伤口中的玻璃太多了”他伸出手，从白色的桌布底部撕下一条细长的带子，把它绑在我肘部上方的胳膊上，形成一个止血带。血的味道令我眩晕，耳朵嗡嗡作响。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Edward's eyes narrowed as we ganged up on him, but, finally, he nodded once and sprinted smoothly through the kitchen's back door. I was sure he hadn't taken a breath since I'd sliced my finger.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当我们联合起来反对他的时候，爱德华的眼睛眯了起来，但是，最后他马上点了点头，旋即小跑着从厨房的后门出去了。我确定从我划伤手指头的那一刻起他就没有吸过一口气。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes," I eagerly agreed. "Go find Jasper."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“对啊”我迫不及待地表示同意“去看看贾斯帕”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Though it erased the sting, it reminded me of the gash, and I watched Carlisle's face carefully to distract me from what his hands were doing. His hair gleamed gold in the bright light as he bent over my arm. I could feel the faint stirrings of unease in the pit of my stomach, but I was determined not to let my usual squeamishness get the best of me. There was no pain now, just a gentle tugging sensation that I tried to ignore. No reason to get sick like a baby.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尽管这消除了刺痛的感觉，却让我想起那道深深的伤疤，我端详着卡莱尔的脸，使自己不要注意他用手正在做的事情。他低着头专心地处理我胳膊上的伤口，头发在明亮的灯光下闪闪发光。我能感觉到激动的情绪隐隐约约地在我心中升起，但我下定决心不要让平时恶心的感觉战胜我的理智。现在没有疼痛了，只有我努力忽略的轻柔的牵引感。我没道理像个孩子似的感到难受。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Just go, Edward," I sighed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“还是走吧，爱德华”我叹了叹气。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Carlisle decided to intercede. "Edward, you may as well go find Jasper before he gets too far. I'm sure he's upset with himself, and I doubt he'll listen to anyone but you right now."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡莱尔决定充当和事老了“爱德华，在贾斯帕过于自责之前，你不妨过去看看他，我确信他现在正在生自己的气呢，我怀疑现在除了你之外，他听不进别人的话”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I winced as Carlisle did something to my arm that stung.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡莱尔往我的胳膊上擦了种令人刺痛的东西，我胳膊一缩。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You don't need to be a hero," I said. "Carlisle can fix me up without your help. Get some fresh air."</div>

<div class="line_en">"You might as well do something useful," Alice added.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你不妨做些有意义的事情”爱丽丝补充道。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你为什么要如此自我虐待呢”我喃喃自语道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I can handle it," he insisted. But his jaw was rigid; his eyes burned with the intensity of the thirst he fought, so much worse for him than it was for the others.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我能应付”他坚持道，但是他的下巴僵硬；眼睛里浮现出与强烈的渴望作斗争的痛苦神情，这种痛苦来得比其他人更强烈，更糟糕。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">If she hadn't been in my line of sight, I wouldn't have noticed Alice give up and steal out of the room. With a tiny, apologetic smile on her lips, she disappeared through the kitchen doorway.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="要是爱丽丝没出现在我的视线中，我根本不会注意到她也放弃了，偷偷地跑出了房间。她嘴角带着些许歉意的笑容消失在厨房门口。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's not your fault," Carlisle comforted me with a chuckle. "It could happen to anyone."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这不是你的错”卡莱尔轻声地安慰我说“这种事情会发生在每个人身上”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, that's everyone," I sighed. "I can clear a room, at least."</div>

<div class="line_en">He laughed again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他又笑了起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"How can you do this?" I demanded. "Even Alice and Esme…" I trailed off, shaking my head in wonder. Though the rest of them had given up the traditional diet of vampires just as absolutely as Carlisle had, he was the only one who could bear the smell of my blood without suffering from the intense temptation. Clearly, this was much more difficult than he made it seem.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你是如何做到现在这样的”我询问道“甚至连爱丽丝和埃斯梅…”我的声音逐渐变小，好奇地摇着头。尽管其他人已经放弃了吸血鬼的传统食谱，其彻底程度和卡莱尔一样，但是卡莱尔是唯一能够忍受我的血液味道而不需承受抵抗强烈诱惑之苦的人。显然，这比他表现出来的要难得多。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His relaxed calm was only more amazing set in direct contrast with everyone else's reaction. I couldn't find any trace of anxiety in his face. He worked with quick, sure movements. The only sound besides our quiet breathing was the soft plink, plink as the tiny fragments of glass dropped one by one to the table.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他从容自若的反应与其他人的反应形成了惊人的强烈反差，我在他脸上找不到丝毫的焦虑。他的手敏捷自如、游刃有余地活动着。除了我们轻轻的呼吸声之外，房间里唯一的声音就是小小的玻璃碎片一片一片地落在桌子上时发出来的轻轻“叮铃，叮”声。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Do you think it would be harder if you took a vacation from the hospital for a long time. And weren't around any blood?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“要是你从医院里长时间的休假，你认为会更难做到吗？要是周围没有任何血腥味”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His dark eyes were calm and thoughtful as he answered. "Hmm. What I enjoy the very most is when my… enhanced abilities let me save someone who would otherwise have been lost. It's pleasant knowing that, thanks to what I can do, some people's lives are better because I exist. Even the sense of smell is a useful diagnostic tool at times." One side of his mouth pulled up in half a smile.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他回答我的时候，黝黑的眼眸流露出镇定自若，深思熟虑的神情来“呃，我最喜欢做的事情就是当我的……提高了的能力使我挽救他人，不然的话，他们就会丧命。多亏了我能做的事情，有些人的生活因为我的存在而变得更好，了解到这一点是很开心的事。很多时候，甚至连嗅觉也是一种有用的诊断工具”他向一侧扬起嘴角，露出半个笑容。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Plink, plink, plink. I was surprised at how much glass there seemed to be in my arm. I was tempted to glance at the growing pile, just to check the size, but I knew that idea would not be helpful to my no-vomiting strategy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="叮铃，叮铃，叮铃。我惊讶地发现居然有那么多的玻璃碎片刺进了我的胳膊。我有种偷偷地看一眼桌上堆起来的玻璃碎片的冲动，只是想看看到底有多大一堆，但是我知道这个想法对我抵抗呕吐的策略没多少帮助。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Maybe." He shrugged his shoulders, but his hands remained steady. "I've never felt the need for an extended holiday." He flashed a brilliant smile in my direction. "I enjoy my work too much."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“或许吧”他耸了耸肩，但是他的手还是很稳定“我从来没觉得需要延长假期”他冲着我露出一个灿烂的微笑“我太喜欢我的工作了”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What is it that you enjoy?" I wondered. It didn't make sense to me -- the years of struggle and self-denial he must have spent to get to the point where he could endure this so easily. Besides, I wanted to keep him talking; the conversation kept my mind off the queasy feeling in my stomach.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你到底喜欢做什么事情呢”我好奇地问道。他一定经历了多年的挣扎和自我否定才做到轻松地承受住这种诱惑——而这些对我而言都没有意义。此外，我想让他一直说话；这样的谈话会使我的注意力从反胃上移开。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You try very hard to make up for something that was never your fault," I suggested while a new kind of tugging started at the edges of my skin.

<div class="line_cn" title="“你非常努力地弥补那些与你无关的过错”当一种新的牵引感在我皮肤的边缘升起的时候，我间接地解释道“我的意思是，并不是你自己想要成为这样的。你并没有自己选择这种生活，然而你却要如此努力地克制自己”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I mulled that over while he poked around, making sure all the glass splinters were gone. Then he rummaged in his bag for new tools, and I tried not to picture a needle and thread.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“这听起来太容易了”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He examined my arm again. "There," he said, snipping a thread. "All done." He wiped an oversized Q-tip, dripping with some syrup-colored liquid, thoroughly across the operation site. The smell was strange; it made my head spin. The syrup stained my skin.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他再次检查了我的胳膊“好了”他边说边剪断一根线“全好了”他把一种糖浆色的液体涂在创伤面上，形成一个超大的Q型图形。这种味道很奇怪，令我的头一阵眩晕。糖浆一样的东西在我的皮肤上留下一层颜色。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"In the beginning, though," I pressed while he taped another long piece of gauze securely in place, sealing it to my skin. "Why did you even think to try a different way than the obvious one?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"You know my father was a clergyman," he mused as he cleaned the table carefully, rubbing everything down with wet gauze, and then doing it again. The smell of alcohol burned in my nose. "He had a rather harsh view of the world, which I was already beginning to question before the time that I changed." Carlisle put all the dirty gauze and the glass slivers into an empty crystal bowl. I didn't understand what he was doing, even when he lit the match. Then he threw it onto the alcohol-soaked fibers, and the sudden blaze made me jump.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你知道我父亲是位牧师”他一边打趣一边仔细地清理桌面，用湿纱布把上面的东西都擦下去，接着又这样做了一遍。酒精发出刺鼻的味道“他的世界观相当严厉，在我还没有发生改变之前，我就开始质疑了”卡莱尔把所有的脏纱布和玻璃银器倒进空的水晶碗里。我不明白他在做什么，甚至当他擦亮火柴的时候我还是没弄明白。接着他把火柴扔到被酒精浸湿的纤维上，突如其来的火焰吓了我一跳。">查看中文翻译</div>

Not even the reflection in the mirror."</div>

<div class="line_en">I pretended to examine the dressing on my arm to hide my surprise at the direction our conversation had taken. Religion was the last thing I expected, all things considered. My own life was fairly devoid of belief. Charlie considered himself a Lutheran, because that's what his parents had been, but Sundays he worshipped by the river with a fishing pole in his hand. Renee tried out a church now and then, but, much like her brief affairs with tennis, pottery, yoga, and French classes, she moved on by the time I was aware of her newest fad.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我假装检查我胳膊上的包皮扎以掩饰我对我们谈话往这个方向发展而感到的惊讶之情。在所有我想过的事情中，宗教是我万万没有想到的。在我自己的生活中，信仰是相当匮乏的，查理把自己当成路德派，因为他的父母是路德派教徒，但是星期天他会手中拿着钓鱼竿在河畔表示对神的崇拜。蕾妮也时不时地做礼拜，但是就像她对网球、陶瓷、瑜伽和法语的短暂爱好一样，在我还不知道她最新的爱好时她已经继续往前走了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I don't think that's foolish," I mumbled. I couldn't imagine anyone, deity included, who wouldn't be impressed by Carlisle. Besides, the only kind of heaven I could appreciate would have to include Edward. "And I don't think anyone else would, either."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我认为那并不傻”我低声说道，我无法想象任何人，包皮括神在内，不会对卡莱尔难以忘怀。此外，我能感激的唯一的天堂就应该包皮括爱德华在内“我认为其他人也不会这么想”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm sure all this sounds a little bizarre, coming from a vampire." He grinned, knowing how their casual use of that word never failed to shock me. "But I'm hoping that there is still a point to this life, even for us. It's a long shot, I'll admit," he continued in an offhand voice. "By all accounts, we're damned regardless.

It was just after sunset, and I'd arrived to relieve the doctors who'd been working all day. That was a hard time to pretend -- there was so much work to be done, and I had no need of rest.

<div class="line_en">The kiss began much the same as usual -- Edward was as careful as ever, and my heart began to overreact like it always did. And then something seemed to change. Suddenly his lips became much more urgent, his free hand twisted into my hair and held my face securely to his. And, though my hands tangled in his hair, too, and though I was clearly beginning to cross his cautious lines, for once he didn't stop me. His body was cold through the thin quilt, but I crushed myself against him eagerly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他大笑起来，接着叹息道“要是我做了我不想做的事情，上天会惩罚我的”他说的时候声音里夹杂着一种奇怪的绝望语调，同时，他用手托起我的下巴，使我的脸贴近他的脸。这个吻和以前一样开始——爱德华和以前一样小心翼翼，我的心也像以往一样过度反应起来。接着好像有什么发生了改变。突然他的嘴唇变得更加急切起来，他空着的手揉搓着我的头发，紧紧地把我脸贴近他的脸。尽管我的手也伸进了他的头发，尽管我明目张胆地开始跨越他设定的警戒线，这一次他却没有制止我。他的身体透过这层薄被子还是那么冰冷，但是我迫不及待地向他靠拢。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He laughed, and then sighed. "Heaven forbid that I should do anything I don't want to do," he said in a strangely desperate tone as he put his hand under my chin and pulled my face up to his.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Fine," I agreed, snuggling closer to him. I really did feel exhausted. It had been a long day in so many ways, yet I felt no sense of relief at its end. Almost as if something worse was coming tomorrow. It was a silly premonition -- what could be worse than today?' Just the shock catching up with me, no doubt.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好吧”我只得同意，和他依偎得更近了。我真的感到精疲力竭了。从许多方面而言，今天看来都是漫长的一天，然而我感到这事情还没完，也没有感觉到丝毫的宽慰，好像明天会有更糟糕的事情发生一样。这只不过是个愚蠢的恶兆——还有什么比今天更糟糕的呢？我只不过是被吓坏了，这是毫无疑问的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I was halfway asleep, maybe more, when I realized what his kiss had reminded me of: last spring, when he'd had to leave me to throw James off my trail, Edward had kissed me goodbye, not knowing when -- or if -- we would see each other again. This kiss had the same almost painful edge for some reason I couldn't imagine. I shuddered into unconsciousness, as if I were already having a nightmare.</div>
