<div class="line_en">She was afraid the bug wouldn't make it up and down all these mountains and that they would get stranded by the side of the road where somebody might come ripping along and hit them. Danny himself was more sanguine; if Daddy thought the bug would make this one last trip, then probably it would.</div>

<div class="line_en">Danny was impressed with the mountains. One day Daddy had taken them up in the ones near Boulder, the ones they called the Flatirons, but these were much bigger, and on the tallest of them you could see a fine dusting of snow, which Daddy said was often there year-round.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="丹尼完全被山景吸引住了。有一天爸爸曾带他们到博尔德附近去爬山，对，叫弗拉提龙山，可眼前这些山却要高得多，最高的山上还有好看的积雪，爸爸说，这些雪一年四季都不化。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Wendy brushed her hair back from her temples. "Thank God." She was sitting in the right-hand bucket, a Victoria Holt paperback open but face down in her lap. She was wearing her blue dress, the one Danny thought was her prettiest. It had a sailor collar and made her look very young, like a girl just getting ready to graduate from high school. Daddy kept putting his hand high up on her leg and she kept laughing and brushing it off, saying Get away, fly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="温迪把鬓角的头发往后理了理。“谢天谢地。”她坐在右边的座位上，膝盖上搁了一本平装的《维多利亚—霍尔特》。她穿着一条蓝色连衣裙，丹尼说这是她最漂亮的衣服。裙子的领子是水手领，这使她显得非常年轻，就像一个快要毕业的女中学生。爸爸老往她大腿上摸，她总是咯咯地笑，把爸爸的手推开，说“去去去，讨厌鬼”。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Now they were passing another sign.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时，他们正驶过一个路牌。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Half an hour ago they had passed another sign that Daddy said was very important. This sign said ENTERING SIDEWINDER PASS, and Daddy said that sign was as far as the snowplows went in the wintertime. After that the road got too steep. In the winter the road was closed from the little town of Sidewinder, which they had gone through just before they got to that sign, all the way to Buckland, Utah.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="半小时前，他们路过了另一个牌子，爸爸说它很重要。牌子上写着：“塞德温得山口”。爸爸说，冬天里扫雪车就扫到这里为止。这之后的路太陡了。冬天，从刚才他们经过的小镇塞德温得一直到犹他州的巴克兰的公路都不通。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And they were actually in the mountains, no goofing around. Sheer rock faces rose all around them, so high you could barely see their tops even by craning your neck out the window. When they left Boulder, the temperature had been in the high seventies. Now, just after noon, the air up here felt crisp and cold like November back in Vermont and Daddy had the heater going… not that it worked all that well. They had passed several signs that said FALLING ROCK ZONE (Mommy read each one to him), and although Danny had waited anxiously to see some rock fall, none had. At least not yet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们现在真正是置身山中，而不是匆匆过客。他们四周全是壁立的峭岩，高得把脖子伸出窗外也望不到顶。他们离开博尔德的时候，温度高达华氏70度。现在，刚过正午，这儿的空气已经是冷嗖嗖的了，感觉像11月的佛蒙特，爸爸打开了加热器…可它工作得并不那么好。他们经过了几个写着“小心飞石”的牌子（妈妈每次都念给他），尽管丹尼焦急地等待着石块掉下来，但一块也没掉。至少到此为止还没掉。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"The bug will make it," Danny said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“甲壳虫能开上去。”丹尼说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That one says SLOWER VEHICLES USE RIGHT LANE. That means us."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“写着‘慢车右行’。就是说我们的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Please, God," Mommy said, and crossed her fingers. Danny looked down at her open-toed sandals and saw that she had crossed her toes as well. He giggled. She smiled back, but he knew that she was still worried.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“保佑我们，上帝。”妈妈说，手指交叉着。丹尼低头看看她露着脚趾的凉鞋，发现妈妈的脚趾头也交叉在一起。他咯咯地笑了。妈妈对他也笑了笑，但是他知道，她仍然很担心。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The rock wall fell away on their right, disclosing a slash valley that seemed to go down forever, lined a dark green with Rocky Mountain pine and spruce. The pines fell away to gray cliffs of rock that dropped for hundreds of feet before smoothing out. She saw a waterfall spilling over one of them, the early afternoon sun sparkling in it like a golden fish snared in a blue net. They were beautiful mountains but they were hard. She did not think they would forgive many mistakes. An unhappy foreboding rose in her throat. Further west in the Sierra Nevada the Donner Party had become snowbound and had resorted to cannibalism to stay alive. The mountains did not forgive many mistakes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="岩壁在他们右边直落而下，展现出一道深不见底的山谷，岩壁边缘是一线墨绿色的落基山松和云杉。紧接着松树坡的是灰白的悬崖。下落几百英尺之后才接上缓坡。温迪看见一道瀑布在一处悬崖上飞泄而下，午后的阳光照在上面，熠熠生辉，像一条落进蓝色鱼网中的金鱼。群山美不胜收，但也十分冷酷。她不相信它们会有多么宽容。一种不祥的预感涌上了她的嗓子眼里。再往西就是内华达山脉，几年前，唐纳登山队被雪封在山里，为了活命他们甚至残食同伴的尸体。它们并不宽容。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"The fuel pump will go another three miles," Jack said shortly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“油泵还能坚持三英里，”杰克简短地说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The road wound up and up in a series of slow S curves, and Jack dropped the bug's stick shift from fourth gear to third, then into second. The bug wheezed and protested, and Wendy's eye fixed on the speedometer needle, which sank from forty to thirty to twenty, where it hovered reluctantly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="公路弯弯曲曲的，绕了一连串的S形弯道，杰克把甲壳虫的挡位从4挡减到3挡，然后又减到2挡。甲壳虫呼哧呼哧地爬着，温迪的眼睛紧盯着速度计的指针，眼看着它从40掉到30，再掉到20，并在20上不情愿地晃来晃去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jack nodded. "It goes right to Stapleton Airport in Denver. There's already some icy patches up beyond the hotel, Watson says, and they're forecasting more snow for tomorrow up higher. Anybody going through the mountains now wants to be on one of the main roads, just in case. That goddam Ullman better still be up there. I guess he will be."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杰克点了点头。“这条路一直通到丹佛市的斯泰普尔顿机场。沃森说，比饭店海拔高的地方已经冻上了冰凌；天气预报说明天海拔高的地方还要下雪。现在无论谁在山里旅行都想走主干道，为的是以防万一。厄尔曼那家伙最好还在饭店里。我想他会的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You know," she said, "I don't think we've seen five cars since we came through Sidewinder. And one of them was the hotel limousine."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你瞧，”温迪说，“离开塞德温得后，一路上我们碰到的汽车还不到五辆，其中有一辆还是饭店的班车。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">With a punch of the clutch and a jerk, Jack shifted down to first gear and they labored upward, the bug's engine thumping gamely.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杰克蹬了一脚离合器，猛一拉，将挡位降到一挡，甲壳虫吃力地往上爬着，发动机砰砰地喘着粗气。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"There's the top," Jack said, pointing three hundred yards ahead. "There's a scenic turnout and you can see the Overlook from there. I'm going to pull off the road and give the bug a chance to rest." He craned over his shoulder at Danny, who was sitting on a pile of blankets. "What do you think, doc? We might see some deer. Or caribou."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那儿就到顶了，”杰克指着前面300码开外的地方说。“那儿有个观景停车处，从那儿可以看到远望饭店。我把车停到岔道上，让它歇歇气儿。”他向坐在一堆毯子里的丹尼扭过头去。“你觉得怎么样，博士？我们也许还能看到梅花鹿，或者北美驯鹿。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You're sure the larder is fully stocked?" she asked, still thinking of the Donners.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“储藏的食品肯定够吗？”温迪问道，她还想着唐纳登山队的事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He said so. He wanted Hallorann to go over it with you. Hallorann's the cook."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他是这样说的。他想让哈洛伦和你一起检查一下。哈洛伦是饭店的厨师。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh," she said faintly, looking at the speedometer. It had dropped from fifteen to ten miles an hour.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“噢，”她小声说，一边看着速度计。时速已经从1英里降到了10英里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For a moment she was unable to breathe at all; the view had knocked the wind from her. They were standing near the top of one peak. Across from them -- who knew how far? -- an even taller mountain reared into the sky, its jagged tip only a silhouette that was now nimbused by the sun, which was beginning its decline.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有一会儿，她简直喘不过气来，被眼前的景色震慑得目瞪口呆。他们站在一个山峰的峰顶附近。他们面对的——谁知道有多远？——一座更高的山直指苍穹，此刻，太阳已经偏西，它那锯齿状的峰顶在逆光中只剩下了一道剪影。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For Wendy, it was discovering truth in a cliché: her breath was taken away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此刻的温迪——用一句老话来说——屏住了呼吸。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The whole valley floor was spread out below them, the slopes that they had climbed in the laboring bug falling away with such dizzying suddenness that she knew to look down there for too long would bring on nausea and eventual vomiting. The imagination seemed to spring to full life in the clear air, beyond the rein of reason, and to look was to helplessly see one's self plunging down and down and down, sky and slopes changing places in slow cartwheels, the scream drifting from your mouth like a lazy balloon as your hair and your dress billowed out…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="整个谷底在他们下面延伸，大众车驮着他们爬上来的那些山坡异常陡峭，她知道，在那些山坡边缘俯视那么一会儿就会让人恶心，甚至呕吐。在这明澈的空气中，想像力似乎也开始信马由缰，任意驰骋，不再受理性的羁绊。而俯瞰深谷则无异于眼睁睁地看着自己往下坠，往下坠，一直往下坠。在缓缓的旋转中，天空与山坡交换着位置，你的头发和衣裙飘然而起，这时，你口中溢出的惊叫声也只不过像一只悠闲的气球…">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The VW labored up and up. The speedometer dropped to just above the five-mile-an-hour hashmark and was beginning to hitch when Jack pulled off the road ("What's that sign, Mommy?" "SCENIC TURNOUT," she read dutifully) and stepped on the emergency brake and let the VW run in neutral.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大众车吃力地往上爬着，速度刚刚超过五公里的下限。杰克把车开到岔道上，（“妈妈，那个牌子上写的是什么？”“观景停车处。”她认认真真地念道。）踏在紧急制动上，让车空转，速度计指针猛地晃动起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She jerked her gaze away from the drop almost by force and followed Jack's finger. She could see the highway clinging to the side of this cathedral spire, switching back on itself but always tending northwest, still climbing but at a more gentle angle. Further up, seemingly set directly into the slope itself, she saw the grimly clinging pines give way to a wide square of green lawn and standing in the middle of it, overlooking all this, the hotel. The Overlook.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她强迫自己把目光从陡坡收回，顺着杰克的手指望去。她看到紧挨着那座高大建筑物一侧的公路，蜿蜒曲折，但总的方向是西北，还是上坡，但平缓了许多。再往上，她看见茂密的松林中嵌入了一片绿草地，草地中央就是那俯视这一切的饭店——远望饭店。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Seeing it, she found breath and voice again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="看到它，温迪又找回了呼吸和声音。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes, it is," he said. "Unman says he thinks it's the single most beautiful location in America. I don't care much for him, but I think he might be… Danny! Danny, are you all right?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，”杰克说。“厄尔曼说这是美国最拔尖的风景地。我不大喜欢他，但我想他也许…丹尼！丹尼，你怎么啦？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“噢，杰克，真是太漂亮了！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She looked around for him and her sudden fear for him blotted out everything else, stupendous or not. She darted toward him. He was holding onto the guardrail and looking up at the hotel, his face a pasty gray color. His eyes had the blank look of someone on the verge of fainting.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她四处张望寻找丹尼，为他而生的担心抹去了其余的一切——无论重大的还是渺小的。她向丹尼冲了过去。他抓着护栏，望着饭店，脸色惨白。目光呆滞，好像马上就要晕倒。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And in the bug, which moved upward more surely on the gentler grade, he kept looking out between them as the road unwound, affording occasional glimpses of the Overlook Hotel, its massive bank of westward-looking windows reflecting back the sun. It was the place he had seen in the midst of the blizzard, the dark and booming place where some hideously familiar figure sought him down long corridors carpeted with jungle. The place Tony had warned him against. It was here. It was here. Whatever Redrum was, it was here.</div>
