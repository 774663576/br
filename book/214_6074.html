<div class="line_en">Instantly the figure reappeared, and making a wide circuit, began to head me off. I was tired, at any rate; but had I been as fresh as when I rose, I could see it was in vain for me to contend in speed with such an adversary. From trunk to trunk the creature flitted like a deer, running manlike on two legs, but unlike any man that I had ever seen, stooping almost double as it ran. Yet a man it was, I could no longer be in doubt about that.</div>

<div class="line_en">I was now, it seemed, cut off upon both sides; behind me the murderers, before me this lurking nondescript. And immediately I began to prefer the dangers that I knew to those I knew not. Silver himself appeared less terrible in contrast with this creature of the woods, and I turned on my heel, and looking sharply behind me over my shoulder, began to retrace my steps in the direction of the boats.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在看来我是腹背受敌；在我身后是杀人凶手，在我前面是这个隐蔽的怪物。立刻我意识到，与其遭遇未知的危险，莫不如去面对已知的危险。同树林里这个活物比起来，西尔弗他本人也不那么可怕了，于是我转过身去，一边敏锐地关注着我的身后，开始向划子停泊的地方折回我的脚步。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">From the side of the hill, which was here steep and stony, a spout of gravel was dislodged and fell rattling and bounding through the trees. My eyes turned instinctively in that direction, and I saw a figure leap with great rapidity behind the trunk of a pine. What it was, whether bear or man or monkey, I could in no wise tell. It seemed dark and shaggy; more I knew not. But the terror of this new apparition brought me to a stand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从陡峭而多石的这一侧的小丘上头，扑籁籁地掉下来一堆沙砾，穿过树木纷纷落下来。我的眼睛本能地向那个方向转去，我看到有一个身影飞快地向松树树干后面跳去。它究竟为何物，是熊。是人、还是猿猴，我怎么也说不上来。它看上去黑乎乎、毛茸茸的；更多的我就不知道了。但是这个新出现的吓人的东西使我停了下来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I began to recall what I had heard of cannibals. I was within an ace of calling for help. But the mere fact that he was a man, however wild, had somewhat reassured me, and my fear of Silver began to revive in proportion. I stood still, therefore, and cast about for some method of escape; and as I was so thinking, the recollection of my pistol flashed into my mind. As soon as I remembered I was not defenceless, courage glowed again in my heart and I set my face resolutely for this man of the island and walked briskly towards him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我开始回想起我听说过的食人番来。我差一点就要喊救命了。但他毕竟是个人，虽然是个野人，这一点多少使我安心些。同时我对西尔弗的恐惧重又复活了。因此，我便站住了，一边想着如何逃跑；当我正这么想着的时候，我摹地想起我还有支手铣。一想到我并非毫无抵抗能力，我心中又重新生出了勇气，于是我决心面对这个岛上的人，迈着轻快的步子向他走去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was concealed by this time behind another tree trunk; but he must have been watching me closely, for as soon as I began to move in his direction he reappeared and took a step to meet me. Then he hesitated, drew back, came forward again, and at last, to my wonder and confusion, threw himself on his knees and held out his clasped hands in supplication.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这回他躲在另一棵树的树干后面，但是他一定一直在密切地关注着我，因为一旦我开始向他那边迈步，他便出现了，向我这边迈出了一步。接着他犹豫了，又向后退回去，然后又上前，最后，令我既吃惊又困惑的是，他跪到了地上，十指交叉着向前伸出，一副哀求的样子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I had heard the word, and I knew it stood for a horrible kind of punishment common enough among the buccaneers, in which the offender is put ashore with a little powder and shot and left behind on some desolate and distant island.</div>

<div class="line_en">I could now see that he was a white man like myself and that his features were even pleasing. His skin, wherever it was exposed, was burnt by the sun; even his lips were black, and his fair eyes looked quite startling in so dark a face. Of all the beggar-men that I had seen or fancied, he was the chief for raggedness. He was clothed with tatters of old ship's canvas and old sea-cloth, and this extraordinary patchwork was all held together by a system of the most various and incongruous fastenings, brass buttons, bits of stick, and loops of tarry gaskin. About his waist he wore an old brass-buckled leather belt, which was the one thing solid in his whole accoutrement.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在我已看出，他是个和我一样的白人，并且他的长相还蛮好看。他裸露着的皮肤都被太阳晒黑了，甚至他的嘴唇都是黑的；在这样黑的一张脸上，他的明亮的眼睛着实使人吃惊。在所有我见过或想像出来的乞丐中，他是穿得最破烂的。他穿着船上的旧帆布和防水布的碎片缀成的衣服，这件不同寻常的鹑衣全都是用一系列各不相同、极不协调的栓结物连缀到一块儿的，如铜扣、小细棍以及涂了柏油的束帆索环儿。在他的腰间系着一条旧的带钢扣的皮带，那是他全身上下最结实的一样东西了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Marooned three years agone," he continued, "and lived on goats since then, and berries, and oysters. Wherever a man is, says I, a man can do for himself. But, mate, my heart is sore for Christian diet. You mightn't happen to have a piece of cheese about you, now? No? Well, many's the long night I've dreamed of cheese -- toasted, mostly -- and woke up again, and here I were."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是三年前被放逐的，”他继续说道，“从那以后，就以山羊为生，还有浆果和牡蛎。要我说，人到哪儿都能自谋生路。但是，朋友，我一心向往文明人的饮食。你现在身上是否碰巧带着块干酪？没有？哎，多少个长夜我都梦见干酪──多半是烤好的──等梦醒了，我还是在这儿。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“吉姆，吉姆，”他说道，显然很高兴。“你瞧，吉姆，我过的这种苦日子连你听了都会害臊。嗯，比方说吧，你瞧我这副模样，不会想到我有个信神的母亲吧？”">查看中文翻译</div>

And here's what it come to, Jim, and it begun with chuck-farthen on the blessed grave-stones! That's what it begun with, but it went further'n that; and so my mother told me, and predicked the whole, she did, the pious woman! But it were Providence that put me here. I've thought it all out in this here lonely island, and I'm back on piety. You don't catch me tasting rum so much, but just a thimbleful for luck, of course, the first chance I have. I'm bound I'll be good, and I see the way to. And, Jim" -- looking all round him and lowering his voice to a whisper -- "I'm rich."</div>

The sun was getting up, and mortal white he looked about the cutwater. But, there he was, you mind, and the six all dead -- dead and buried. How he done it, not a man aboard us could make out. It was battle, murder, and sudden death, leastways -- him against six. Billy Bones was the mate; Long John, he was quartermaster; and they asked him where the treasure was. 'Ah,' says he, 'you can go ashore, if you like, and stay,' he says; 'but as for the ship, she'll beat up for more, by thunder!' That's what he said.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Then," he continued, "then you'll up, and you'll say this: Gunn is a good man (you'll say), and he puts a precious sight more confidence -- a precious sight, mind that -- in a gen'leman born than in these gen'leman of fortune, having been one hisself."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“啊，”他说，“那是个麻烦，真的。这样吧，我有条小船，是我自己造出来的，我把它藏在那块白色的岩石下边了。要是到了万不得已的地步，我们天黑后可以试它一试，嘿！”他嚷道，“怎么回事？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For just then, although the sun had still an hour or two to run, all the echoes of the island awoke and bellowed to the thunder of a cannon.</div>

<div class="line_en">And I began to run towards the anchorage, my terrors all forgotten, while close at my side the marooned man in his goatskins trotted easily and lightly.</div>

I come here and prayed, nows and thens, when I thought maybe a Sunday would be about doo. It weren't quite a chapel, but it seemed more solemn like; and then, says you, Ben Gunn was short-handed -- no chapling, nor so much as a Bible and a flag, you says."</div>
