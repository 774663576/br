<div class="line_cn" title="杜洛埃沉思了一会儿。在此之前，他一直拿不准这位前经理是不是在幕后施加影响的人物。他猜想不是，但是这样一肯定就使他放心了。他想一定是嘉莉抛弃了他，她也应该这样做。“一个人干出那样的事情来，总是做错了，”他说。">查看中文翻译</div>

Toward the dead of winter, Carrie came back, appearing on Broadway in a new play; but he was not aware of it.

<div class="line_en">"Well," he said, as one pleased with a puzzle, "the expression in your face is one that comes out in different things.

<div class="line_en">"The world is always struggling to express itself," he went on. "Most people are not capable of voicing their feelings. They depend upon others. That is what genius is for.
