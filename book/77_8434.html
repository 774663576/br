<div class="line_en">The apartment is on the third floor of a massive neoclassical block in an area called Avtovo. The building must once have been very grand, the sort of property where senior Communist Party officials and their families lived, but it has clearly been in decline for decades. The fittings are worn, the lift creaks, the plumbing clanks and grumbles.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We're lying at opposite ends of a huge old enamel bath in Dasha's apartment. Tall windows overlook a broad highway from which the rumble and hiss of traffic and the clanking of trams are dimly audible. Oxana, needless to say, has taken the end of the bath without the taps, but the hot water is bliss after our confinement in the container.</div>

<div class="line_en">"You want me to say you worked for MI6? Seriously? I told her what I had to tell her to get her trust, because right now, we need her. We need new identities, new passports, all that shit, and she can fix it. Or at least she's connected to people who can fix that. Basically, we can stay here as long as we need to, she'll help us, and she won't give us up. But she'll also expect me to do something for her in return. Something big. So we have to wait and see what that something turns out to be."</div>

Her father Gennadi led a brigade for the Kupchino Bratva, which controls the St. Petersburg heroin trade, and when he retired he passed the leadership of the brigade to Dasha. It's almost unknown for a woman to hold rank in the gangs, but she was already a fully initiated vor, and people respected her."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dasha, I have to admit, takes very good care of us. The apartment is impersonal, and the room she assigns to us has an unaired, unused feel to it. The windows, which are locked shut, have the thick, greenish look of bulletproof glass. But the bed is comfortable enough, and after breakfast, which is brought to us by a young woman who introduces herself as Kristina, we both fall fast asleep again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"She only tortured you a bit."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Eve, pupsik, you have to move on from this morning. See it from her point of view. That Prekrasnaya Nevesta warehouse pays her to protect them, and we did make quite a mess in there. Dasha had to be seen to be taking control of the situation."</div>

<div class="line_en">It's good to be in direct sunlight. The sky is dark azure blue, and the morning's snowfall has frozen, dusting the grimy, yellow-brown buildings with sparkling white. Lunch is a Big Mac and fries, and then Kristina walks us a short distance down Stachek Prospekt to a second-hand store in a converted cinema, the Kometa. The seats have been removed from the auditorium, which now holds rank after rank of clothing stalls. These offer everything from goth and punk fashions to old theater costumes, military and police regalia, fetish-wear and homemade jewelry. The place smells musty and cloying, as such places always do, and it's oddly poignant to wander down the aisles beneath the art deco chandeliers, picking through the tattered residue of other people's lives.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When we wake it's almost midday, and we're ravenous again. The apartment appears to be empty except for Kristina, who has clearly been waiting for us to surface. Handing us each a warm down-filled jacket, she leads us out of the flat, and we descend to the street in the shuddering lift. My ankle is less swollen than it was, and although it's still sore, I can walk.</div>

<div class="line_en">Oxana gives my waist a squeeze. "Reinvent yourself, pupsik. Go crazy."</div>

<div class="line_en">"In these clothes, you'll look as if you've lived in St. Petersburg forever, like subculture people," Kristina says. Tall and long-legged, with hair the color of wheat and a gentle, hesitant manner, she's an unlikely member of a gangster household. She doesn't speak often, and when she does it's so quietly that we strain to hear her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In this spirit, I make a point of choosing things I'd never have considered in my former life. A midnight-blue velvet coat, its silk lining in tatters, its label identifying it as the property of the Mikhailovsky Theatre. A studded jacket painted with anarchist slogans. A mohair sweater striped in black and yellow like a bee. It occurs to me that I'm enjoying myself, something I've never felt while buying clothes before. Oxana seems to be having a pretty good time too. She's as ruthless out shopping as she is in every other area of her life, not hesitating to rip a garment out of my hands if she wants it for herself.</div>

<div class="line_en">Afterward, we take a taxi to Aviatorov Park. Why Kristina wants to take us there, I'm not sure. Maybe it's the nearest thing to a tourist attraction that Avtovo has to offer. As the sky darkens, and flurries of new snow whirl around us, we mooch across the near-deserted park to a frozen lake girded by dark, skeletal trees. On the far shore, a Soviet monument stands on a promontory. A MiG fighter aircraft leaping into the sky, arrested at the moment of takeoff. Kristina indicates it perfunctorily before continuing on her ghostly way along the icy lakeside path. Only then does it occur to me that she has been ordered to keep us away from the apartment for as long as possible, so that Dasha can search our possessions and decide what to do about us. Which might include selling us out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A visit to a nearby hairdressing and nail salon completes our makeover. Kristina pays for everything from a large roll of cash, which I'm guessing is Dasha's. In the salon she sits quietly, staring into space, as Oxana and I are attended to. The stylist gives me a short, choppy bob, while Oxana gets a spiky pixie cut. My nails end up turquoise, hers black. When we're done Kristina gives us a rare, shy smile. "Now you look like proper Russians," she tells us.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I ask Oxana about this, and she's doubtful. "The only people who'd be interested in me, in us, are the Twelve, and they operate at a much higher level than outfits like the Kupchino Bratva."</div>

<div class="line_en">Days pass, and I begin to feel stronger. My shoulders are still painful, especially in the mornings, and I can't walk far without my ankle protesting. But Dasha feeds us well, and the effects of living in a container on starvation rations are beginning to ebb. Oxana runs every day, sometimes for two or three hours, and pushes herself through a rigorous exercise routine on her return. I spend the time trying to improve my Russian by reading Dasha's back issues of Vogue and listening to Radio Zenith, the local current affairs channel.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Look, Dasha didn't get to be a brigadier in a bratva by being stupid. If she breaks the vory code and betrays me to the Twelve or anyone else, she won't ever be trusted again. Also, I'd kill her. Maybe not immediately, but one day I'd come for her, and she knows it."</div>

</div>
<div class="line_en">What Oxana hasn't yet raised with Dasha is the question of Lara Farmanyants, currently languishing in Butyrka jail in Moscow. Personally, I'd be happy to see the bitch rot there forever. Not only is she Oxana's ex, she also tried to kill me. But Oxana wants her out of there, and is planning to ask Dasha whether it might be possible, through her vory connections, to make this happen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She keeps the details about our departure from England vague, and is confident that Dasha believes her, more or less. She's asked Dasha about fixing us up with Russian interior passports and new identities. This appears to be possible, for a price.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sleeping with Oxana is so different from sleeping with Niko. Where Niko's body was unambiguous, so familiar that it was part of my waking and sleeping, Oxana's body is enigmatic. The more I explore it, the more mysterious it seems. Hard and soft, yielding and predatory. She draws me deeper and deeper. There are times when she slides into an impenetrable silence, or pushes me away from her, tense with anger at some imagined slight, but mostly she's skittish and tender. She's like a cat, yawning and stretching and purring, all lean muscle and sheathed claws. When we sleep, she faces outwards and I fold into her. She snores.</div>

<div class="line_en">I know that I can never tell her this, just as I'm certain that she will never tell me that she loves me, because those words have no meaning for her. I know that I have only myself to blame. I believed that I could somehow finesse her affectless nature, and in the cold light of day I see this to be impossible. St. Petersburg winter days are short, however, and the nights are long. In our shared bed, wrapped in darkness and dreams and the warm smell of her body, I find myself believing it again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I try not to let the idea of Lara upset me, but Oxana knows how vulnerable I feel when compared to her former girlfriend, and misses no opportunity to drop references to Lara's amazing physique, athleticism and sexual virtuosity. There's a rational part of me that knows that she can't possibly miss Lara in the way that she claims to, and probably doesn't give her a moment's thought from one day to the next. But love is not rational, and for all Oxana's casual cruelties, I have stopped pretending to myself that I'm not in love with her.</div>

<div class="line_en">A week after our arrival, Kristina directs Oxana and me to a department store where there is a photo booth. When we return, Dasha takes the prints and tells us that we should have our Russian internal passports and other identity documents within the week. In total, for both of us, the cost will be fifteen hundred U. S. dollars, which Oxana pays immediately. There are cheaper versions available, Dasha says, but they are recognizable as forgeries. I'm glad to see the money handed over, because I'm beginning to feel uncomfortable about accepting Dasha's hospitality on an indefinite basis, vory code or no vory code. I'm also aware of Oxana's increasing restlessness, which running and exercise cannot assuage. "I need to work," she tells me, pacing the flat like a caged panther. "I need to feel I'm alive."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After pocketing the cash for the documents, Dasha informs us that she's hosting a dinner at the apartment that evening. Her boss is coming, his name is Asmat Dzabrati, and we should address him as Pakhan, or leader. He is a hugely respected figure, apparently. A gangster boss of the old school, who in his younger days was known for dispatching rivals with an ax. With the Pakhan will be the gang's three other brigadiers, Dasha herself being the fourth. It's an important occasion, Dasha impresses on us, and she's anxious for it to go well. Kristina will lend us the appropriate clothes.</div>

<div class="line_en">We're in the apartment's principal reception room. This is furnished with heavy grandeur and dominated by a spotlit portrait of Dasha lounging in a smoking jacket, holding a cigar. Opposite the painting, between the tall windows overlooking Stachek Prospekt, an ice sculpture of the Russian president riding a bear drips on a sideboard. At the far end of the room a white-jacketed steward with a bandaged head is serving drinks at a generously stocked bar. Belatedly, I recognize the gang member that Oxana laid out cold in the warehouse. His colleagues mock him, slapping him condescendingly on the cheek as they collect their drinks, laughing at his idiocy in allowing himself to be hospitalized by a woman.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Asmat Dzabrati is one of the least remarkable men I've ever met. Short, with thinning hair and mild, rabbity eyes, he's the last of the evening's guests to arrive. His entrance is low-key, but he's immediately the center of attention. The Pakhan wields the kind of power that doesn't proclaim itself, but is evident in the demeanor of others. As he is helped from his shabby overcoat, led to a chair and furnished with a drink, the other guests enact an elaborately deferential dance, positioning themselves around him in hierarchical ranks. The inner circle consists of Dasha and the other brigadiers, then there's a cordon of bodyguards and foot soldiers, and finally the wives and girlfriends. Oxana threads herself between these groups like a shark, never quite finding a resting place, while I drift around the outer perimeter of scented, dressed-to-kill women, smilingly listening in on conversations, and moving on if there's any suggestion that I'm expected to do more than nod in agreement.</div>

<div class="line_en">I take a glass of pink Latvian champagne from the bandaged barman, who eyes me ruefully, and search the crowd for Oxana. She's deep in conversation with Dasha, and although I can't hear what either of them is saying I can see the sly flash of Oxana's eyes and Dasha's slow, complicit smile. They look at me and laugh, and although I'm tempted to hurl my glass at them, I sip the sweet, ice-cold champagne instead.</div>

<div class="line_en">Kris materializes beside me. She looks elegant in gray chiffon, but out of place among the glittering Kupchino Bratva women, like a moth among fireflies. "They're so boring," she murmurs to me. "It's impossible to have an intelligent conversation with any of them. They only talk about three things. Clothes, kids, and how to stop their men screwing around."</div>

Do you think you might have some if you met the right guy?' And of course I have to be polite and play along, because Dasha would be high-key angry if I was rude to them, but I want to say, 'You know what, bitches? There's never going to be a "right guy," so suck on that.'"</div>

<div class="line_en">Clapping her hands to announce that dinner is served, Dasha squires the Pakhan out of the room. The rest of us follow the two of them at a sedate pace into an ornate dining room, where a long table has been set for twenty. A crystal chandelier sends out rainbow spikes of light, the air is heavy with the scent of lilies, and along the center of the table, framed by gold cutlery and glassware, a glazed sturgeon is laid out like a corpse. Place cards indicate where we should sit and the protocol is strict. The Pakhan occupies the place of honor, flanked by Dasha and another brigadier, the soldiers are arranged on either side of them, and the women cluster around the table ends.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I'm wary. Has Dasha instructed her to fish for information about us? But then I drain my champagne glass and look Kristina in the eye, and she's so transparently guileless, and I so badly need an ally, that I'm almost tempted to tell her the truth.</div>

<div class="line_en">Oxana, looking fabulous in the tuxedo suit, has been placed between two of the soldiers, and I watch as her eyes narrow with anger as she realizes that she has not been seated among the Kupchino Bratva elite. I've learned the hard way just how badly she reacts to any perceived disrespect. Something flips in her. Possessed by the need to reassert control over the situation, she's capable of the most lacerating viciousness. I watch as one of the men tries to converse with her and is icily ignored. I could have told him not to bother. When she's like this she's impossible.</div>

The men stare at me and at each other, spluttering as they repeat my words, and Dasha has tears running down her cheeks. The laughter goes on and on, as I look desperately from face to face. Even Kris is smiling. "Don't worry," one of the brigadiers says, wiping his eyes with his napkin. "You're among friends. Your secret's safe with us." Only one person is not amused, and that is Oxana, who is staring at me with icy, undiluted hatred.</div>

<div class="line_en">The meal seems to go on forever. Endless courses of soup, baked meat, ash-roasted beetroot, sturgeon with porcini mushrooms, dumplings and pastries. And vodka, glass after tiny glass of it. Citrus vodka, cardamom vodka, raspberry, pepper and bison grass vodka. Every couple of minutes someone proposes a toast. To companionship, loyalty, honor, the vory life, beautiful women, absent friends and death. I try to sip discreetly rather than swig, but am soon hopelessly, wretchedly, drunk. Time slows to a ticking standstill. The conversation and laughter rise and fall, the room swims in and out of focus. Angelina and others attempt conversation, but give up when they discover that I can only manage slurred and simplistic responses. From time to time I glance over at Oxana, but she is making a point of avoiding my gaze, and conversing animatedly and flirtatiously with everyone around her. The briefest complicit smile or sympathetic glance would turn the evening around for me, but none is forthcoming. Instead, her eyes slide over me as if I'm simply not there.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Planning another torture session?" I ask, and Dasha has the grace to look uncomfortable. "Can I just say I've had the loveliest evening. The food was divine and your friends are delightful. I particularly liked the Pakhan. He's a riot."</div>

There, I sit on the edge of the bed for ten minutes, listening to the thudding of my pulse as the vodka creeps through my system. Drawing back a curtain, I watch as a tram rumbles laboriously down the street, sparks intermittently cascading from its overhead cable. Then I go to the chest of drawers, open the second drawer and take the Glock from beneath my bee-striped sweater. I'm sorry that I haven't yet had the chance to wear the sweater, but it's time to face the fact that my life is over. I have made a catastrophic series of decisions, the worst of which was entrusting my life to a murderer with mental health issues whose interest in me was fleeting at best. She persuaded me that there was nowhere else to hide, that she was my only chance of survival, and I in my turn persuaded myself that this was true.</div>

<div class="line_en">Finally, mercifully, the last toast has been drunk. Na pososhok, one for the road. Everyone stands, and the Pakhan is escorted from the dining room by his bodyguards. Standing at the door, I watch the guests file past. Some smile at me, some shake hands; one or two of the women, clearly as drunk as I am, embrace me like old friends. As Oxana passes, her face is stone.</div>

<div class="line_en">A heart shot, then. That will be appropriate in so many ways. It'll probably take me a few moments longer to die, but I won't be disfigured. Taking off my glasses, I put them on the bedside table. Then I kick off my shoes, and lie down on the bed with two pillows supporting my upper body. Here we go. An end to fear, to worry, to everything.</div>

<div class="line_en">I don't think I can bear the idea of a head shot. I don't want to be found with half my skull missing and my brains all over the silk-upholstered headboard and the damask curtains. I don't particularly like Dasha, but neither do I want to force her to redecorate.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When I'm comfortable on the pillows, I slap the magazine into the Glock and rack the slide. The gun is now cocked, but to shoot myself in the heart I have to invert it, place the barrel against my chest and slip the pad of my thumb through the trigger guard. This is an awkward maneuver when you're drunk. Glocks don't have a safety catch, they have a double trigger. You have to engage both parts, and I'm just aligning them with my thumb when a faint sound penetrates my consciousness.</div>
