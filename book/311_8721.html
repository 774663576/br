<div class="line_en">He did look different. More beautiful than ever. When she got on the bus, Park was sitting tall in the seat, so she could see him. (Or maybe so that he could see her.) And when he let her into the seat, he sat back down again against her. They both slouched down low.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他看起来果然不同，比以往更好看了。她踏上校车，看见他坐得笔直，好让她能一眼看见。（或者他可以一眼看见她。）他起身让她坐进去，然后马上坐下靠近她。两人躲得低低的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He was probably going to break up with her tomorrow. Whatever. At least she wouldn't have to meet his dad. God, what must his dad be like?

<div class="line_en">His mom looked exactly like a doll. In The Wizard of Oz -- the book, not the movie -- Dorothy goes to this place called the Dainty China Country, and all the people are tiny and perfect.

<div class="line_en">Park's mom made Eleanor feel like a giant. Eleanor couldn't be that much taller than her, maybe three or four inches. But Eleanor was so much bigger. If you were an alien who came to Earth to study its life forms, you wouldn't even think the two of them were the same species.</div>

<div class="line_en">When Eleanor was around girls like that -- like Park's mom, like Tina, like most of the girls in the neighborhood -- she wondered where they put their organs. Like, how could you have a stomach and intestines and kidneys, and still wear such tiny jeans? Eleanor knew that she was fat, but she didn't feel that fat. She could feel her bones and muscles just underneath all the chub, and they were big, too. Park's mom could wear Eleanor's ribcage like a roomy vest.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was just too much. Meeting his pretty, perfect mom. Seeing his normal, perfect house. Eleanor hadn't known there were houses like that in this crappy neighborhood -- houses with wall-to-wall carpeting and little baskets of potpourri everywhere. She didn't know there were families like that. The only upside to living in this effed-up neighborhood was that everybody else was effed up, too. The other kids might hate Eleanor for being big and weird, but they weren't going to hate on her for having a broken family and a broke-down house. That was kind of the rule around here.</div>
