<div class="line_en">But sorrow is not so easily put aside. The stricken man carried it with him like the fatal stamp of which Virgil speaks.

<div class="line_cn" title="但内心的痛苦是不能这样被驱逐的，象维吉尔①所说的命运之箭一样，受伤的人得永远带着它。他走进去关上了门，一走到他的客厅，他的精力就支持不住了，他象呜咽似的嘘出了一声叹息，倒入一张椅子里。【注：①维吉尔（公元前71－19），古罗马诗人。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When Villefort approached, she stepped out of the shadow of the wall against which she was leaning and barred his path. Dantès had told the prosecutor about his fiancée, and Villefort recognized Mercédès without her giving her name. He was surprised at the beauty and dignity of the woman and, when she asked him what had become of her lover, he felt as though he was the defendant and she was the judge.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当维尔福走过去的时候，她也迎上前来，站在他的前面。邓蒂斯曾说到过他的新娘，所以维尔福立刻认出是她。她的美丽和高贵的仪态使他吃了一惊，当她问到她爱人的情形的时候，他觉得倒象她是法官而他是被告了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Even now, there was a moment's hesitation in his heart. Many times before he had called for the death penalty, with no more emotion than that aroused by the contest between the accuser and the accused; and these convicts, who had gone to their deaths because of the thundering eloquence with which he had convinced the judges or the jury, had left no shadow on his brow: they had been guilty; or, at least, so Villefort believed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他犹豫了一会儿。他常常主张处犯人以极刑，靠了他那不可抗拒的雄辩把他们判了罪，可是他的眉头从来没有蒙上过最轻微的忏悔的阴影，因为他们是有罪的，——至少，他相信是如此。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now, in the depths of that sick heart the first seeds of a mortal abscess began to spread. That man whom he was sacrificing to his own ambition, that innocent man who was paying the price for the guilt of Villefort's father, appeared before him, pale and menacing, clasping the hand of a fiancée who was no less pale, and bearing remorse in his train: not the remorse that makes its victims leap up like a Roman raging against his fate, but that bitter, muffled blow that intermittently chimes on the soul and sears it with the memory of some past action, an agonizing wound that lacerates, deeper and deeper until death.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后，在那颗有病的心底里，产生了一个致命创伤的第一个病菌。那个由于他的野心而被他牺牲的人，那个代他父亲受过的无辜的牺牲者，在他的面前出现了，脸色苍白，带着威胁的神气，一只手携了他的未婚妻，她的脸也象他一样苍白，他们给他带来了内疚，——不是古人所说的那种猛烈可怕的内疚，而是一种缓慢的，折磨人的，到死都是与日俱增的痛苦。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">If at that moment Renée's sweet voice had sounded in his ear calling for clemency, or if the lovely Mercédès had come in and said: "In the name of the God who sees us and judges us, give me back my betrothed," then, surely, that brow, already half prepared to submit to the inevitable, would have bent altogether, and he would no doubt have taken the pen in his numbed fingers and, despite the risk to himself, signed the order to set Dantès free. But no voice spoke in the silence and the door opened only to Villefort's valet de chambre, who had come to tell him that the post-horses were harnessed to his barouche.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在这个时候，假如他的耳边响起丽妮的甜蜜的声音请他从宽办理，或那美貌的美茜蒂丝进来对他说，“看上帝面上，我求您把我的未婚夫放还给我！”那他就会不顾一切，用他那冰冷而颤抖的手签署他的释放令。但没有声音来打破房间里的沉寂，只有维尔福的仆人推开门进来，告诉他长途旅行的马车已经准备好了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This time, however, it was a different matter. He had just condemned a man to perpetual incarceration, but an innocent man, poised on the brink of good fortune, depriving him not only of freedom, but also of happiness. He was not a judge this time, but an executioner. And when he thought of that, he felt the muffled blow that we described, something that he had not previously experienced, sounding in the depths of his heart and filling his breast with a vague feeling of apprehension. Thus a wounded man will be put on his guard by a powerful and instinctive prescience of pain and tremble whenever his finger approaches the site of an open, bleeding wound, for as long as it remains unhealed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但现在这件事却完全不同。他给一个清白无辜的人判了无期徒刑，——一个站在幸福之门前面的清白无辜的人。在这一次，他不是法官，而是刽子手了。他以前从来没有过这种感觉，但现在，当他这样回想的时候，这种感觉涌上他的心头，使他怀着茫然的恐惧，犹如是一个受伤的人当一只手指接近他的伤口时会本能地颤抖起来是同样的道理，只有当创伤弥合以后这种恐惧才会消失。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">On the corner of the Rue de la Loge, poor Mercédès had met Fernand, who was following her. She had returned to Les Catalans and thrown herself on her bed in an extremity of desperation. Fernand knelt beside the bed and, clasping an icy hand that Mercédès did not think to take from him, covered it with ardent kisses that Mercédès did not even feel. So she spent the night. The lamp went out when the oil was exhausted, but she no more noticed the darkness than she had noticed the light. When day returned, she was unaware of that also. Sorrow had covered her eyes with a blindfold that showed her only Edmond.</div>

<div class="line_en">M. Morrel would not admit defeat: he had learned that Dantès had been taken to prison, after being questioned, so he hastened to see all his friends and visit anyone in Marseille who might have some influence there. But already the rumour was spreading that the young man had been arrested as a Bonapartist agent. Since at that time even the most daring considered any attempt by Napoleon to recover the throne as an insane fantasy, M. Morrel was greeted everywhere with indifference, fear or rejection, and returned home in despair, admitting that the position was serious and that no one could do anything about it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="摩莱尔先生并没有放弃奋斗。他打听到邓蒂斯已被押入牢里，就去找他所认识的一切朋友和城里有势力的人，但城里的消息早已传开，说邓蒂斯因为是做拿破仑党的专使而被捕的，而当时即使最热情的人也认为要想使拿破仑复位是疯狂之举，因此他所得到的只是拒绝，只能失望地回家。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Danglars was alone, but neither troubled nor disturbed. Danglars was even happy, because he had taken revenge on an enemy and ensured himself the place on board the Pharaon that he had feared he might lose. Danglars was one of those calculating men who are born with a pen behind their ear and an inkwell instead of a heart. To him, everything in this world was subtraction or multiplication, and a numeral was much dearer than a man, when it was a numeral that would increase the total (while a man might reduce it). So Danglars had gone to bed at his usual hour and slept peacefully.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="只有邓格拉司毫未感到烦恼或不安，他甚至还很高兴，——他已弄掉一个敌人，并保全了他在埃及王号上的地位。邓格拉司是一味只替自己打算的人，这种人生下来就已在耳朵边上夹了支蘸水笔，心里藏着一瓶墨水。一切在他看来都只是加减乘除而已。他估计一个人的生命还不及一个数字那样宝贵，因为数字能使总数有所增加，而生命却只会渐渐减少。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Caderousse, for his part, was deeply disturbed and troubled. Instead of following M. Morrel's example, going out and attempting to do something for Dantès (which was, in any case, impossible), he shut himself in with two bottles of cassis and tried to drown his anxiety in drunkenness. But such was his state of mind that two bottles were not enough to extinguish his thoughts; so he remained, too drunk to fetch any more wine, not drunk enough to forget, seated in front of his two empty bottles, with his elbows on a rickety table, watching all the spectres that Hoffmann scattered across manuscripts moist with punch, dancing like a cloud of fantastic black dust in the shadows thrown by his long-wicked candle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡德罗斯也感到身心不安，但他没有想办法援助邓蒂斯，只是带了两瓶酒把自己关在房间里，想用酒来忘掉他的回忆。但他却没有成功，他醉得无法再去多取一点酒，但却不能忘掉过去的种种。">查看中文翻译</div>
