<div class="line_en">On Monday there'll be bulldozers on the gravel outside, the council has promised. Kent forced them to promise, because he said otherwise he would not let them go to have their lunch. And so they promised and crossed their hearts that turf would be laid down and there would be proper goals with nets. Proper chalked sidelines. It was not a reasonable choice to give a human being, but Britt-Marie remembered what it was like losing a sibling, she remembered just how much one could lose oneself. With this in mind, she felt this was the best possible thing she could give someone who was every bit as lost. A soccer pitch.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="地方议会保证说，下周一他们就会派推土机到娱乐中心外面的停车场去。是肯特强迫他们答应的，因为他说，如果不这样，他就不让西装们吃午饭。于是他们捂着心口承诺，一定尽快给足球场铺草皮，安装带网的球门，画好符合标准的边线和球门线。虽然议会的决定让她有些进退两难，但布里特—玛丽知道失去一个兄弟姐妹的感觉，也明白假如没有信念支撑，人会如何迷失自我。考虑到这些，她觉得自己能够给予博格的最好礼物，就是一个足球场。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She could hear voices through the open door of the pizzeria, but she didn't go in. It was best that way, she felt. The recreation center was empty, but the door of the refrigerator was ajar. The rat teeth marks on the rubber seal of the door made it clear enough what had happened. The cellophane over the plate had been chewed away and every last crumb of peanut butter and Nutella on it had been licked clean. On its way out the rat had stumbled on Britt-Marie's tin of baking soda, overturning it on the dish rack. There were tracks in the white dust. Two pairs, in fact. The rat had been there on a date, or a meeting, or whatever they called it these days.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="透过敞开的披萨店前门，她听到店里的说话声，但没有进去，因为她觉得最好不要这么做。娱乐中心空空荡荡，冰箱的门虚掩着，从橡胶密封条上的老鼠牙印可以清楚地判断出发生了什么。原本盛着花生酱和可可酱的盘子上的保鲜膜被啃掉了，整个盘子都舔得一干二净。离开的时候，老鼠还碰翻了布里特—玛丽的小苏打罐，碗碟架周围全是小苏打和清晰的老鼠脚印，而且显然是一对老鼠的脚印：两只老鼠大概刚刚在这儿约会过，或者见面，或者随便你怎么说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Britt-Marie sat on one of the stools for a long time, with a towel in her lap. Then she mopped her face and cleaned the kitchen.

<div class="line_en">In the graveled parking area between the recreation center and the pizzeria are two quite gigantic old trucks with their headlights turned on.

It takes a good while before Britt-Marie understands they are playing soccer.</div>

<div class="line_en">She continues down the road. Stands for a few heartbeats outside a modest little house with a modest little garden. If you didn't know it was there you could easily walk past without paying any attention to it and, in this sense, the house has a great deal in common with its owner. The police car is not parked outside, the windows are not lit up. Once she's absolutely certain that Sven is not at home, Britt-Marie sneaks up to the door and knocks on it.
