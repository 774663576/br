<div class="line_en">Syme had vanished. A morning came, and he was missing from work: a few thoughtless people commented on his absence. On the next day nobody mentioned him. On the third day Winston went into the vestibule of the Records Department to look at the notice-board. One of the notices carried a printed list of the members of the Chess Committee, of whom Syme had been one. It looked almost exactly as it had looked before -- nothing had been crossed out -- but it was one name shorter. It was enough. Syme had ceased to exist: he had never existed.</div>

<div class="line_en">The weather was baking hot. In the labyrinthine Ministry the windowless, air-conditioned rooms kept their normal temperature, but outside the pavements scorched one's feet and the stench of the Tubes at the rush hours was a horror. The preparations for Hate Week were in full swing, and the staffs of all the Ministries were working overtime. Processions, meetings, military parades, lectures, waxworks, displays, film shows, telescreen programmes all had to be organized; stands had to be erected, effigies built, slogans coined, songs written, rumours circulated, photographs faked. Julia's unit in the Fiction Department had been taken off the production of novels and was rushing out a series of atrocity pamphlets. Winston, in addition to his regular work, spent long periods every day in going through back files of "The Times" and altering and embellishing news items which were to be quoted in speeches. Late at night, when crowds of rowdy proles roamed the streets, the town had a curiously febrile air. The rocket bombs crashed oftener than ever, and sometimes in the far distance there were enormous explosions which no one could explain and about which there were wild rumours.</div>

<div class="line_en">The new tune which was to be the theme-song of Hate Week (the Hate Song, it was called) had already been composed and was being endlessly plugged on the telescreens. It had a savage, barking rhythm which could not exactly be called music, but resembled the beating of a drum. Roared out by hundreds of voices to the tramp of marching feet, it was terrifying. The proles had taken a fancy to it, and in the midnight streets it competed with the still-popular "It was only a hopeless fancy". The Parsons children played it at all hours of the night and day, unbearably, on a comb and a piece of toilet paper. Winston's evenings were fuller than ever. Squads of volunteers, organized by Parsons, were preparing the street for Hate Week, stitching banners, painting posters, erecting flagstaffs on the roofs, and perilously slinging wires across the street for the reception of streamers. Parsons boasted that Victory Mansions alone would display four hundred metres of bunting. He was in his native element and as happy as a lark. The heat and the manual work had even given him a pretext for reverting to shorts and an open shirt in the evenings. He was everywhere at once, pushing, pulling, sawing, hammering, improvising, jollying everyone along with comradely exhortations and giving out from every fold of his body what seemed an inexhaustible supply of acrid-smelling sweat.</div>

<div class="line_en">A new poster had suddenly appeared all over London. It had no caption, and represented simply the monstrous figure of a Eurasian soldier, three or four metres high, striding forward with expressionless Mongolian face and enormous boots, a submachine gun pointed from his hip. From whatever angle you looked at the poster, the muzzle of the gun, magnified by the foreshortening, seemed to be pointed straight at you. The thing had been plastered on every blank space on every wall, even outnumbering the portraits of Big Brother. The proles, normally apathetic about the war, were being lashed into one of their periodical frenzies of patriotism. As though to harmonize with the general mood, the rocket bombs had been killing larger numbers of people than usual. One fell on a crowded film theatre in Stepney, burying several hundred victims among the ruins. The whole population of the neighbourhood turned out for a long, trailing funeral which went on for hours and was in effect an indignation meeting. Another bomb fell on a piece of waste ground which was used as a playground and several dozen children were blown to pieces. There were further angry demonstrations, Goldstein was burned in effigy, hundreds of copies of the poster of the Eurasian soldier were torn down and added to the flames, and a number of shops were looted in the turmoil; then a rumour flew round that spies were directing the rocket bombs by means of wireless waves, and an old couple who were suspected of being of foreign extraction had their house set on fire and perished of suffocation.</div>

<div class="line_en">Four, five, six -- seven times they met during the month of June. Winston had dropped his habit of drinking gin at all hours. He seemed to have lost the need for it. He had grown fatter, his varicose ulcer had subsided, leaving only a brown stain on the skin above his ankle, his fits of coughing in the early morning had stopped. The process of life had ceased to be intolerable, he had no longer any impulse to make faces at the telescreen or shout curses at the top of his voice. Now that they had a secure hiding-place, almost a home, it did not even seem a hardship that they could only meet infrequently and for a couple of hours at a time. What mattered was that the room over the junk-shop should exist. To know that it was there, inviolate, was almost the same as being in it. The room was a world, a pocket of the past where extinct animals could walk. Mr Charrington, thought Winston, was another extinct animal. He usually stopped to talk with Mr Charrington for a few minutes on his way upstairs. The old man seemed seldom or never to go out of doors, and on the other hand to have almost no customers. He led a ghostlike existence between the tiny, dark shop, and an even tinier back kitchen where he prepared his meals and which contained, among other things, an unbelievably ancient gramophone with an enormous horn. He seemed glad of the opportunity to talk. Wandering about among his worthless stock, with his long nose and thick spectacles and his bowed shoulders in the velvet jacket, he had always vaguely the air of being a collector rather than a tradesman. With a sort of faded enthusiasm he would finger this scrap of rubbish or that -- a china bottle-stopper, the painted lid of a broken snuffbox, a pinchbeck locket containing a strand of some long-dead baby's hair -- never asking that Winston should buy it, merely that he should admire it. To talk to him was like listening to the tinkling of a worn-out musical-box. He had dragged out from the corners of his memory some more fragments of forgotten rhymes. There was one about four and twenty blackbirds, and another about a cow with a crumpled horn, and another about the death of poor Cock Robin. "It just occurred to me you might be interested," he would say with a deprecating little laugh whenever he produced a new fragment. But he could never recall more than a few lines of any one rhyme.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="四、五、六——他们在六月共相会了七次。温斯顿已经放弃了喝杜松子酒的习惯。他也似乎不想喝酒了。他身体长胖了，静脉曲张有所好转，只在脚踝上边的皮肤上留下一块褐色疤痕，他早晨的剧烈咳嗽也停了。日常生活不再难以忍受了，他不再有对着电幕做鬼脸或扯着嗓子骂人的冲动。既然现在有了一个安全的藏身处，几乎是一个家，因而，即使他们不能频繁幽会，每次见面也只有几个小时，但这不再是困苦难挨的了。关键在于旧货店楼上的这个房间存在着。知道它在那儿，几乎等同于置身于内。这个房间就是一个世界，一块过去的飞地，已灭绝的动物在那儿漫步。温斯顿想，查林顿先生就是一种灭绝动物。他在上楼的时候，通常会停下来和查林顿先生说上几分钟。这位老人似乎很少或从不出门，此外，他几乎没有一个顾客。他在狭小暗淡的店铺和更小的后厨房过着一种幽灵似的生活，厨房是他一日三餐的地方，也堆着各种杂物，其中有一台大喇叭留声机，令人难以置信。他似乎很高兴有人跟他聊天。游荡在他那些毫无价值的旧货之间，伸着长鼻子，戴着厚眼镜，穿着天鹅绒夹克，弯着背，他总有一种收藏家的神情，而不像是一个做买卖的。带着一种泄了气的热情，他会指着这件或那件无用的旧货——瓷瓶塞、破鼻烟壶的彩色盖子、铜制盒式项链坠，里面放着一缕夭折多年的婴儿的头发——但从不问温斯顿是否要买，只是问他是否喜欢。和他说话如同聆听一只旧八音盒的丁零声。他从记忆深处打捞出那些老歌的残片。有一首歌是关于二十四只乌鸫的，还有一首关于一头有着皱巴巴的角的母牛，还有一首关于可怜的知更鸟的死亡。“我想你也许会感兴趣，”每当他想起一段歌词，他就会不以为然地微笑着说。但每一首歌他都只能想起几句。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the room over Mr Charrington's shop, when they could get there, Julia and Winston lay side by side on a stripped bed under the open window, naked for the sake of coolness. The rat had never come back, but the bugs had multiplied hideously in the heat. It did not seem to matter. Dirty or clean, the room was paradise. As soon as they arrived they would sprinkle everything with pepper bought on the black market, tear off their clothes, and make love with sweating bodies, then fall asleep and wake to find that the bugs had rallied and were massing for the counter-attack.</div>

<div class="line_en">Both of them knew -- in a way, it was never out of their minds that what was now happening could not last long. There were times when the fact of impending death seemed as palpable as the bed they lay on, and they would cling together with a sort of despairing sensuality, like a damned soul grasping at his last morsel of pleasure when the clock is within five minutes of striking. But there were also times when they had the illusion not only of safety but of permanence. So long as they were actually in this room, they both felt, no harm could come to them. Getting there was difficult and dangerous, but the room itself was sanctuary. It was as when Winston had gazed into the heart of the paperweight, with the feeling that it would be possible to get inside that glassy world, and that once inside it time could be arrested. Often they gave themselves up to daydreams of escape. Their luck would hold indefinitely, and they would carry on their intrigue, just like this, for the remainder of their natural lives. Or Katharine would die, and by subtle manoeuvrings Winston and Julia would succeed in getting married. Or they would commit suicide together. Or they would disappear, alter themselves out of recognition, learn to speak with proletarian accents, get jobs in a factory and live out their lives undetected in a back-street. It was all nonsense, as they both knew. In reality there was no escape. Even the one plan that was practicable, suicide, they had no intention of carrying out. To hang on from day to day and from week to week, spinning out a present that had no future, seemed an unconquerable instinct, just as one's lungs will always draw the next breath so long as there is air available.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们两个都知道——在某种程度上，他们从来没有说出口——眼下所发生的不会长久。有时，即将来到的死亡似乎像他们躺在上面的床一样显而易见，他们带着一种绝望的肉欲缠绵在一起，就像注定要下地狱的灵魂抓住最后一丝快乐，钟就要在五分钟内敲响。但有的时候，他们不但觉得安全，还有永久的幻想。只要他们在这个房间，他们俩就觉得，没有什么能伤害他们。去那儿是困难和危险的，但这房间本身却是避难所。当温斯顿注视着镇纸的中心，会有这样的感觉：他们能够进入那玻璃世界，而一旦置身其间，时间便会停止。他们经常会做逃脱厄运的白日梦。他们的幸运会始终伴随，他们可以故伎重演，就像这次一样，安然度过余生。或者凯瑟琳会死去，通过巧妙的运作，温斯顿和朱丽亚成功地步入婚姻的殿堂。或者他们一起自杀。或者他们会消失，改变模样让人难以辨认，学着像无产者一样说话，在工厂找份工作，在一条小巷里过隐姓埋名的生活。但正如他们自己知道，这全是无稽之谈。实际上，无可逃避。即使自杀的计划是可行的，但他们无意实施。抓住每一天，过好每一周，因为没有前途，就拉长当下的时光，像一种不可征服的本能，也正如一个人的肺，只要有空气，就不会停止呼吸。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sometimes, too, they talked of engaging in active rebellion against the Party, but with no notion of how to take the first step. Even if the fabulous Brotherhood was a reality, there still remained the difficulty of finding one's way into it. He told her of the strange intimacy that existed, or seemed to exist, between himself and O'Brien, and of the impulse he sometimes felt, simply to walk into O'Brien's presence, announce that he was the enemy of the Party, and demand his help. Curiously enough, this did not strike her as an impossibly rash thing to do. She was used to judging people by their faces, and it seemed natural to her that Winston should believe O'Brien to be trustworthy on the strength of a single flash of the eyes. Moreover she took it for granted that everyone, or nearly everyone, secretly hated the Party and would break the rules if he thought it safe to do so. But she refused to believe that widespread, organized opposition existed or could exist. The tales about Goldstein and his underground army, she said, were simply a lot of rubbish which the Party had invented for its own purposes and which you had to pretend to believe in. Times beyond number, at Party rallies and spontaneous demonstrations, she had shouted at the top of her voice for the execution of people whose names she had never heard and in whose supposed crimes she had not the faintest belief. When public trials were happening she had taken her place in the detachments from the Youth League who surrounded the courts from morning to night, chanting at intervals "Death to the traitors!" During the Two Minutes Hate she always excelled all others in shouting insults at Goldstein. Yet she had only the dimmest idea of who Goldstein was and what doctrines he was supposed to represent. She had grown up since the Revolution and was too young to remember the ideological battles of the fifties and sixties. Such a thing as an independent political movement was outside her imagination: and in any case the Party was invincible. It would always exist, and it would always be the same. You could only rebel against it by secret disobedience or, at most, by isolated acts of violence such as killing somebody or blowing something up.</div>

<div class="line_en">In some ways she was far more acute than Winston, and far less susceptible to Party propaganda. Once when he happened in some connexion to mention the war against Eurasia, she startled him by saying casually that in her opinion the war was not happening. The rocket bombs which fell daily on London were probably fired by the Government of Oceania itself, "just to keep people frightened". This was an idea that had literally never occurred to him. She also stirred a sort of envy in him by telling him that during the Two Minutes Hate her great difficulty was to avoid bursting out laughing. But she only questioned the teachings of the Party when they in some way touched upon her own life. Often she was ready to accept the official mythology, simply because the difference between truth and falsehood did not seem important to her. She believed, for instance, having learnt it at school, that the Party had invented aeroplanes. (In his own schooldays, Winston remembered, in the late fifties, it was only the helicopter that the Party claimed to have invented; a dozen years later, when Julia was at school, it was already claiming the aeroplane; one generation more, and it would be claiming the steam engine.) And when he told her that aeroplanes had been in existence before he was born and long before the Revolution, the fact struck her as totally uninteresting. After all, what did it matter who had invented aeroplanes? It was rather more of a shock to him when he discovered from some chance remark that she did not remember that Oceania, four years ago, had been at war with Eastasia and at peace with Eurasia. It was true that she regarded the whole war as a sham: but apparently she had not even noticed that the name of the enemy had changed. "I thought we'd always been at war with Eurasia," she said vaguely. It frightened him a little. The invention of aeroplanes dated from long before her birth, but the switchover in the war had happened only four years ago, well after she was grown up. He argued with her about it for perhaps a quarter of an hour. In the end he succeeded in forcing her memory back until she did dimly recall that at one time Eastasia and not Eurasia had been the enemy. But the issue still struck her as unimportant. "Who cares?" she said impatiently. "It's always one bloody war after another, and one knows the news is all lies anyway."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在某些方面，她比温斯顿更敏锐，也更少受到党的宣传的影响。有一次，他提到对欧亚国的战争，她漫不经心地说，在她看来，这场战争根本就没有发生，这让他大吃一惊。每天落到伦敦的火箭弹很可能是大洋国政府自己发射的，“就想让人民处于恐惧之中”。这种想法他真是从来没有产生过。她还告诉他，在两分钟仇恨活动中，她最感困难的是要避免笑出声来，这也让他心生羡慕。但是，只有当党的教条以某种方式影响到她自己的生活时，她才加以质疑。更多的时候，她欣然接受官方意识形态，因为在她看来，真与假的差别似乎并不重要。比如她相信，在学校里她就读到，党发明了飞机（温斯顿记得，在他自己的学生时代，即五十年代后期，党就声称发明了直升机；十几年后，当朱丽亚读书的时候，党宣称发明了飞机；再到下一代，党就会声称蒸汽机也是它发明的了）。当他告诉她，在他出生之前，也早在革命之前，飞机就存在了，但这一事实根本引不起她的兴趣。说到底，谁发明了飞机有什么关系呢？更让他感到震惊的是，他从偶然的交谈中得知，她不记得四年前大洋国与东亚国交战，而与欧亚国和平相处。确实，她认为这场战争就是一个骗局，但显然，她根本就没有注意到交战国已经变了。“我还以为我们一直在和欧亚国打仗呢，”她含糊地说。这让他感到有点恐惧。飞机早在她出生之前就发明了，但交战国的改变只发生在四年前，那时她已经长大成人。为此事，他们争辩了也许有一刻钟。最后他成功地让她回忆，隐约想起有个时期，东亚国，而不是欧亚国是敌人。但这件事她仍然认为并不重要。“谁在意？”她不耐烦地说，“总是一场战争接着一场战争，要知道所有的新闻都是谎言。”">查看中文翻译</div>

Do you realize that the past, starting from yesterday, has been actually abolished? If it survives anywhere, it's in a few solid objects with no words attached to them, like that lump of glass there. Already we know almost literally nothing about the Revolution and the years before the Revolution. Every record has been destroyed or falsified, every book has been rewritten, every picture has been repainted, every statue and street and building has been renamed, every date has been altered. And that process is continuing day by day and minute by minute. History has stopped. Nothing exists except an endless present in which the Party is always right. I know, of course, that the past is falsified, but it would never be possible for me to prove it, even when I did the falsification myself. After the thing is done, no evidence ever remains. The only evidence is inside my own mind, and I don't know with any certainty that any other human being shares my memories. Just in that one instance, in my whole life, I did possess actual concrete evidence after the event -- years after it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他努力让她理解。“这件事与众不同。这不只是某个人被杀的问题。你难道没有意识到，从昨天起，过去实际上被抹杀了？如果有什么可以幸存下来，这必定是一些坚实的物体，而与文字无关，如那块玻璃。我们几乎已经对革命及革命前的生活一无所知。每一种记录都被摧毁或篡改，每一本书重写过，每一幅画重印过，每一座雕像、街道和建筑重新命名过，每一个日期修改过。这种事没日没夜、时时刻刻都在进行，历史停止了。什么都不存在，除了无尽头的现在，而就现在而言，党永远正确。我当然知道，过去被篡改了，但我从来不能加以证实，甚至我自己就在造假。事情做完了，没有证据留下来。唯一的证据只在我的心里，我不能确切地知道，是否还有别人和我一样，拥有同样的记忆。我一生中就有一次，在事件发生之后——多年之后，我掌握了一份具体、确凿无疑的证据。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Not much, perhaps. But it was evidence. It might have planted a few doubts here and there, supposing that I'd dared to show it to anybody. I don't imagine that we can alter anything in our own lifetime. But one can imagine little knots of resistance springing up here and there -- small groups of people banding themselves together, and gradually growing, and even leaving a few records behind, so that the next generations can carry on where we leave off."</div>

<div class="line_en">In the ramifications of party doctrine she had not the faintest interest. Whenever he began to talk of the principles of Ingsoc, doublethink, the mutability of the past, and the denial of objective reality, and to use Newspeak words, she became bored and confused and said that she never paid any attention to that kind of thing. One knew that it was all rubbish, so why let oneself be worried by it? She knew when to cheer and when to boo, and that was all one needed. If he persisted in talking of such subjects, she had a disconcerting habit of falling asleep. She was one of those people who can go to sleep at any hour and in any position. Talking to her, he realized how easy it was to present an appearance of orthodoxy while having no grasp whatever of what orthodoxy meant. In a way, the world-view of the Party imposed itself most successfully on people incapable of understanding it. They could be made to accept the most flagrant violations of reality, because they never fully grasped the enormity of what was demanded of them, and were not sufficiently interested in public events to notice what was happening. By lack of understanding they remained sane. They simply swallowed everything, and what they swallowed did them no harm, because it left no residue behind, just as a grain of corn will pass undigested through the body of a bird.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对党的教条可能产生的后果，她一点兴趣也没有。每当他说起英社的原则、双重思想、过去的可变及对客观现实的否定，还有采用新语，她都感到厌倦和困惑，说她从不关心这类事情。既然谁都知道这全是垃圾，那为什么还要庸人自扰呢？她知道什么时候该欢呼，什么时候该嘲笑，这就够了。要是他坚持谈论这类话题，她的办法是一睡了之。她是那样一种人，无论什么时间、什么地方都能入睡。和她说话，他意识到她多么容易现出正统的模样，而根本抓不住所谓正统的意义。在某种程度上，党的世界观对那些无法理解的人所施加的影响是最成功的。他们被改造得可以接受对现实最严厉的侵犯，因为他们从未完全明白对他们的要求的严重性，他们对公共事件没有足够的兴趣，所以他们注意不到发生了什么。由于缺乏理解，他们仍然神志正常。他们只是吞下一切，他们所吞下的对他们没有伤害，因为没有什么残留下来，就像一粒谷子，进了鸟的肚子而没有被消化。">查看中文翻译</div>
