<div class="line_en">Jill. was asleep. Ever since the owls' parliament began she had been yawning terribly and now she had dropped off. She was not at all pleased at being waked again, and at finding herself lying on bare boards in a dusty belfry sort of place, completely dark, and almost completely full of owls. She was even less pleased when she heard that they had to set off for somewhere else -- and not, apparently, for bed -- on the Owl's back.</div>

<div class="line_en">She did, however, consent to climb on to Glimfeather's back, and was thoroughly waked up (for a while) by the unexpected coldness of the air when he flew out with her into the night. The moon had disappeared and there were no stars. Far behind her she could see a single lighted window well above the ground; doubtless, in one of the towers of Cair Paravel. It made her long to be back in that delightful bedroom, snug in bed, watching the firelight on the walls. She put her hands under her cloak and wrapped it tightly round her. It was uncanny to hear two voices in the dark air a little distance away; Scrubb and his owl were talking to one another. "He doesn't sound tired," thought Jill. She did not realize that he had been on great adventures in that world before and that the Narnian air was bringing back to him a strength he had won when he sailed the Eastern Seas with King Caspian.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，她还是答应爬到格里姆费瑟的背上，当它带着她飞进夜空，空气中那股出乎意料的寒意竟使她完全清醒过来（只有一会儿）。月亮已经不见了，也没有星星。在她后面远处，她能看见地面上有一扇亮着灯的窗户，毫无疑问，那窗户就在凯尔帕拉维尔的一座塔楼里。灯光使她渴望回到那间令人愉快的卧室，蜷在床上，望着墙上映着的火光。她把手放在斗篷下，用斗篷紧紧裹住身子。听着黑沉沉的夜空不远处传来两个声音真有点不可思议。斯克罗布和他那只猫头鹰正在说话呢。“听上去他倒不累。”吉尔想口她不明白斯克罗布以前在这个世界里参加过几场轰轰烈烈的冒险活动，纳尼亚的空气已经使他恢复了当初跟随凯斯宾国王去东部海域航海时获得的力量。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For a long time there was no reply. Then, a long way off, a dim light appeared and began to come nearer. With it came a voice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="叫了半天没有回音。后来，远处出现了一圈暗淡的灯光，渐渐靠近。随即传来一个声音。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When the light reached them, it turned out to be that of a large lantern. She could see very little of the person who held it. He seemed to be all legs and arms. The owls were talking to him, explaining everything, but she was too tired to listen. She tried to wake herself up a bit when she realized that they were saying goodbye to her. But she could never afterwards remember much except that, sooner or later, she and Scrubb were stooping to enter a low doorway and then (oh, thank heavens) were lying down on something soft and warm, and a voice was saying:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="灯光来到他们身边，这才知道那原来是只大灯笼。她看不清那个拿着灯笼的人。它似乎浑身全是胳臂和腿。两只猫头鹰跟它说话，解释一切，但她太累了，没听他们说什么。当她明白它们在跟自己说再见，就尽量想让自己清醒一点。但事后，除此以外，她再也想不起更多的事了，不久，她和斯克罗布就弯腰走进一个低矮的门口，接着（啊呀，谢天谢地）就躺到又柔软又暖和的什么东西上。一个声音说：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jill had to pinch herself to keep awake, for she knew that if she dozed on Glimfeather's back she would probably fall off. When at last the two owls ended their flight, she climbed stiffly off Glimfeather and found herself on flat ground. A chilly wind was blowing and they appeared to be in a place without trees. "Tu-whoo, tu-whoo!" Glimfeather was calling. "Wake up, Puddleglum. Wake up. It is on the Lion's business."</div>

<div class="line_en">What they found outside was quite unlike the bit of Narnia they had seen on the day before. They were on a great flat plain which was cut into countless little islands by countless channels of water. The islands were covered with coarse grass and bordered with reeds and rushes. Sometimes there were beds of rushes about an acre in extent. Clouds of birds were constantly alighting in them and rising from them again-duck, snipe, bitterns, herons. Many wigwams like that in which they had passed the night could be seen dotted about, but all at a good distance from one another; for Marsh-wiggles are people who like privacy. Except for the fringe of the forest several miles to the south and west of them, there was not a tree in sight. Eastward the flat marsh stretched to low sand-hills on the horizon, and you could tell by the salt tang in the wind which blew from that direction that the sea lay over there. To the North there were low pale-coloured hills, in places bastioned with rock. The rest was all flat marsh. It would have been a depressing place on a w et evening. Seen under a morning sun, with a fresh wind blowing, and the air filled with the crying of birds, there was something fine and fresh and clean about its loneliness. The children felt their spirits rise.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们在外面看到这儿和他们昨天看见的那一小块纳尼亚大不相同。他们是在一大片平原上，无数水沟把平原分割为无数小岛。这些小岛都覆盖着粗糙的草，四周都是芦苇和灯心草。有的地方是一片片有一英亩大的灯心草草圃。成群的鸟儿不断地在其中起降——有鸭子、鹊、苍莺。周围还看得见许多棚屋星罗棋布的，就像他们昨晚过夜住的一个样儿，不过所有的棚屋之间都拉开相当距离；因为沼泽怪都喜欢单独居住，不受打扰。除了西面和南面几英里以外的森林边缘外，这地方看不见一棵树。往东面看，平坦的沼泽地伸展到地平线附近低矮的沙丘，从那个方向刮来的风带有一股强烈的咸昧，你就知道那边是海了。北面是灰白色的低矮的山丘，处处筑有石头堡垒。其他地方都是平坦的沼泽地。碰到潮湿的晚上，这地方可真闷得慌。如今在朝阳下看看，还有清新的风吹拂着，空中鸟鸣不绝。这儿虽然荒凉却相当美食、清新、干净。孩子们觉得兴致又高了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"The Marsh-wiggle," said Scrubb, as if he were rather proud of knowing the word. "I expect-hullo, that must be him." And then they both saw him, sitting with his back to them, fishing, about fifty yards away. He had been hard to see at first because he was nearly the same colour as the marsh and because he sat so still.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“沼泽怪。”斯克罗布说，他知道这个叫法似乎相当得意，“我希望——嗨，那个一定就是它。”这时他们俩都看见它了，在约五十码以外，背对他们坐着钓鱼。起初他们看不清，因为它浑身几乎和沼泽一样颜色，而且它坐着一动也不动。—">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As they drew nearer, the figure turned its head and showed them a long thin face with rather sunken cheeks, a tightly shut mouth, a sharp nose, and no beard. He was wearing a high, pointed hat like a steeple, with an enormously wide flat brim. The hair, if it could be called hair, which hung over his large ears was greeny-grey, and each lock was flat rather than round, so that they were like tiny reeds. His expression was solemn, his complexion muddy, and you could see at once that he took a serious view of life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们走近时，那个身影扭过头来，露出一张瘦长脸，面颊凹陷，尖鼻子，嘴唇紧闭，没有胡子。它戴着一顶又高又尖的帽子，就像一座尖塔，还有圈其宽无比的帽檐。披在大耳朵上的头发，要是算得上头发的话，是绿灰色的。而且每根头发都是扁的，而不是圆的，因此更像小芦苇。它的表情很庄重，肤色跟泥巴一样。你立刻就能看出它对生活的态度是很严肃的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Why, it's not in reason that you should like our sort of victuals, though I've no doubt you'll put a bold face on it. All the same, while I am a catching of them, if you two could try to light the fire -- no harm trying --! The wood's behind the wigwam. It may be wet. You could light it inside the wigwam, and then we'd get all the smoke in our eyes. Or you could light it outside, and then the rain would come and put it out. Here's my tinder-box. You won't know how to use it, I expect."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“为什么，虽然我毫不怀疑你们会装得对此毫不在乎的样子，可是要你们喜欢我们这种食品是不合情理的。反正没关系，我在捉鱼的时候，如果你们俩能想法把火生起来——不妨试试看——木柴就在棚屋后面。可能是湿的。你们可以在棚屋里生火，那么所有的烟都会熏到我们眼睛里。你们也可以在外头生火，那么要是下雨，就会把火淋灭了。这是我的51火盒，我想你们不会知道怎么用吧？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The children sat down on each side of him. They now saw that he had very long legs and arms, so that although his body was not much bigger than a dwarf's, he would be taller than most men when he stood up. The fingers of his hands were webbed like a frog's, and so were his bare feet which dangled in the muddy water. He was dressed in earthcoloured clothes that hung loose about him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两个孩子一边一个在它身边坐下。他们这会儿才看见它的胳臂和腿都很长很长，因此尽管它的身体并不比小矮人大，站起来却比多数人高。它的手指有蹼，像青蛙的爪子，两只在泥浆水里晃荡的脚也有蹼。它穿着土黄色的宽松衣服。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But Scrubb had learned that sort of thing on his last adventure. The children ran back together to the wigwam, found the wood (which was perfectly dry) and succeeded in lighting a fire with rather less than the usual difficulty. Then Scrubb sat and took care of it while Jill went and had some sort of wash -- not a very nice one -- in the nearest channel. After that she saw to the fire and he had a wash. Both felt a good deal fresher, but very hungry.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但斯克罗布在上回探险时已经学过这一类事了。两个孩子一起奔回棚屋，找到了木柴（那完全是干的），没费什么事就生起一堆火。于是斯克罗布坐下照顾火堆，吉尔到最近的水沟去洗洗脸——洗得不怎么痛快。洗好后她来照顾火堆，斯克罗布也去洗了一下。两个人都觉得清醒多了，但肚子都很饿了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Presently the Marsh-wiggle joined them. In spite of his expectation of catching no eels, he had a dozen or so, which he had already skinned and cleaned. He put a big pot on, mended the fire, and lit his pipe. Marsh-wiggles smoke a very strange, heavy sort of tobacco (some people say they mix it with mud) and the children noticed the smoke from Puddleglum's pipe hardly rose in the air at all. It trickled out of the bowl and downwards and drifted along the ground like a mist. It was very black and set Scrubb coughing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不一会儿，沼泽怪来了。虽然它估计过一条鲤鱼也捉不到，居然已经捉了十多条，而且已经把鱼皮剥了，洗干净了。它在火上搁了一只大锅，添了柴火，点上了烟斗。沼泽怪抽的是一种十分奇怪、味儿浓的烟草（有人说它们在烟草里搀了泥巴）。两个孩子还注意到普德格伦烟斗里的烟几乎不大往上升，而是从烟斗里一缕缕出来，往下飘，顺着地面像一层薄雾似的飘啊飘的。而且这烟很黑，熏得斯克罗布直咳嗽。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Now," said Puddleglum. "Those eels will take a mortal long time to cook, and either of you might faint with hunger before they're done. I knew a little girl -- but I'd better not tell you that story. It might lower your spirits, and that's a thing I never do. So, to keep your minds off your hunger, we may as well talk about our plans."</div>

You'd have to go across Ettinsmoor. That's where the Ruined City is, if it's anywhere. But I've been as far in that direction as most people and I never got to any ruins, so I won't deceive you."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“从这儿往北边那儿看，”普德格伦说着用烟斗一指，“看见那些小山和悬崖吗？那儿就是艾丁斯荒原开始的地方。不过和我们这儿还隔着一条河，叫斯力布河。当然，没有桥。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔畏缩了，即使是书本里的巨人，她也从来没喜欢过，而且她有一次做噩梦还看见过一个巨人呢。这时她看见斯克罗布的脸也已经发青了，她暗自想道“我敢说他比我还要害怕昵。”这一想她就觉得自己勇敢些了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He quite expected the Marsh-wiggle to give him an angry reply, but he only said, "That's the spirit, Scrubb. That's the way to talk. Put a good face on it. But we all need to be very careful about our tempers, seeing all the hard times we shall have to go through together. Won't do to quarrel, you know. At any rate, don't begin it too soon. I know these expeditions usually end that way: knifing one another, I shouldn't wonder, before all's done. But the longer we can keep off it-"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他原以为沼泽怪也会怒气冲冲地回答他，但它只是说：“这种精神很好，斯克罗布。应该这样说话。摆出满不在乎的样子。不过我们对自己的脾气都要十分小心，要看到我们得一起度过所有的困难时刻。吵架是不行的，你知道吗？不管怎么说，别一开头就吵架。我知道这些探险队通常都是那样结束的：事情还没办成，就五相动刀子，我是不会奇怪的。不过我们避免这一点的时间要能长一点…”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Look here!" said Scrubb, suddenly losing his temper, as people so easily do when they have been frightened. "I don't believe the whole thing can be half as bad as you're making out; any more than the beds in the wigwam were hard or the wood was wet. I don't think Aslan would ever have sent us if there was so little chance as all that."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“听着，”斯克罗布说，他突然发脾气了，人们受了惊很容易发脾气，”我就不相信这件事有你说的一半那么吓人，跟你说的棚屋里的床是硬的、柴是湿的一样没什么可怕。要是这事真的那么希望渺茫，我认为阿斯兰就不会派我们来。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"That's true enough," said Puddleglum. "They're at peace with us all right. As long as we stay on our own side of the Shribble, they won't do us any harm. Over on their side, on the Moor -- Still, there's always a chance. If we don't get near any of them, and if none of them forget themselves, and if we're not seen, it's just possible we might get a long way."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那倒一点不假，”普德格伦说，“他们跟我们相安无事没错。只要我们待在斯力布河自己这边，他们就不会伤害我们。不过，在他们那边呢，在荒原上——总有个万一。要是我们不接近任何巨人，要是他们没人忘乎所以，而我们又没被他们看见，那很可能走上一大段路。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Don't you lose heart, Pole," said Puddleglum. "I'm coming, sure and certain. I'm not going to lose an opportunity like this. It will do me good. They all say -- I mean, the other wiggles all say-that I'm too flighty; don't take life seriously enough. If they've said it once, they've said it a thousand times. 'Puddleglum,' they've said, `you're altogether too full of bobance and bounce and high spirits. You've got to learn that life isn't all fricasseed frogs and eel pie. You want something to sober you down a bit. We're only saying it for your own good, Puddleglum.' That's what they say. Now a job like this -- a journey up north just as winter's beginning, looking for a Prince that probably isn't there, by way of a ruined city that no one has ever seen -- will be just the thing. If that doesn't steady a chap, I don't know what will." And he rubbed his big frog-like hands together as if he were talking of going to a party or a pantomime. "And now," he added, "let's see how those eels are getting on."</div>

<div class="line_en">When the meal came it was delicious and the children had two large helpings each. At first the Marsh-wiggle wouldn't believe that they really liked it, and when they had eaten so much that he had to believe them, he fell back on saying that it would probably disagree with them horribly. "What's food for wiggles may be poison for humans, I shouldn't wonder," he said. After the meal they had tea, in tins (as you've seen men having it who are working on the road), and Puddleglum had a good many sips out of a square black bottle. He offered the children some of it, but they thought it very nasty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那道菜端上来时，味道真美极了，两个孩子都吃了双份儿。起初沼泽怪不相信他们真的喜欢吃，后来看他们吃了那么多，它只好相信了。它退而说这些东西可能大大不合他们口味。“对沼泽怪来说是食物，对人类也许就是毒药，我不会奇怪的。”它说。吃完午饭以后他们又喝茶，茶装在铁皮罐里（就像你们看见那些在路上干活的人喝的一样），普德格伦从一个方的黑瓶子里喝了好多口。他请两个孩子喝一点这种饮料，但他们觉得那东西非常难喝。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The rest of the day was spent in preparations for an early start tomorrow morning. Puddleglum, being far the biggest, said he would carry three blankets, with a large bit of bacon rolled up inside them. Jill was to carry the remains of the eels, some biscuit, and the tinder-box. Scrubb was to carry both his own cloak and Jill's when they didn't want to wear them. Scrubb (who had learned some shooting when he sailed to the East under Caspian) had Puddleglum's secondbest bow, and Puddleglum had his best one; though he said that what with winds, and damp bowstrings, and bad light, and cold fingers, it was a hundred to one against either of them hitting anything. He and Scrubb both had swords Scrubb had brought the one which had been left out for him in his room at Cair Paravel, but Jill had to be content with her knife. There would have been a quarrel about this, but as soon as they started sparring the wiggle rubbed his hands and said, "Ah, there you are. I thought as much. That's what usually happens on adventures." This made them both shut up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="饭后半天时间就都用来准备第二天一早出发的事。普德格伦比起他们来算是最大的，说它将带上三条毯子，里面还包上一大块熏肉。吉尔把吃剩的鳝鱼带上，还有一些饼干和引火盒。斯克罗布就把他和吉尔不穿的斗篷带上。斯克罗布上次跟凯斯宾往东方航行时曾学过一点射箭，所以又带上普德格伦第二把好弓，普德格伦则带着自己最好的那把，可它又说，有风，加上弓弦潮湿，光线不好，手指冰凉，他们俩射中目标的可能性只有百分之一。它和斯克罗布都带上剑——斯克罗布把凯尔帕拉维尔宫在他房里专门为他准备的那把剑带来了。可吉尔只能将就带上那把刀算数。他们本来为此还吵了一架，但刚开始吵，沼泽怪就搓着于说，“啊，又来了吧。我就想到了。去探险往往有这种情况。”这么一说他们俩就都住口了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">All three went to bed early in the wigwam. This time the children really had a rather bad night. That was because Puddleglum, after saying, "You'd better try for some sleep, you two; not that I suppose any of us will close an eye tonight," instantly went off into such a loud, continuous snore that, when Jill at last got to sleep, she dreamed all night about road-drills and waterfalls and being in express trains in tunnels.</div>
