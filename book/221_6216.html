<div class="line_en">The snow came so suddenly that I left home under a bright blue sky and not half an hour later I was headed past a castle that looked like a cake decoration, surrounded by a layer of thick white icing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="雪来得极其突然。我出门时还是一片明亮的蓝天，不到半个小时，我身后的城堡就像蛋糕的粉饰，被一层厚厚的白色糖霜包裹。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I trudged up the drive, my footsteps muffled and my toes already numb, shivering under my too-thin Chinese silk coat. A whirl of thick white flakes emerged from an iron-grey infinity, almost obscuring Granta House, blotting out sound, and slowing the world to an unnatural pace. Beyond the neatly trimmed hedge cars drove past with a newfound caution, pedestrians slipped and squealed on the pavements. I pulled my scarf up over my nose and wished I had worn something more suitable than ballet pumps and a velvet minidress.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我迈着沉重的步伐走上车道，脚被蒙住了，脚指头已经麻木，身体在过薄的中国丝绸外套里面瑟瑟发抖。铁灰色的天际，鹅毛般的大雪在飞旋，几乎让我看不清格兰塔屋，也遮蔽了声音，整个世界放慢到了不自然的速度。在整齐修剪过的树篱那边，小汽车缓慢行驶，行人们滑倒在道路上，发出尖叫。我拉住围巾盖住鼻子，真希望我穿着更合适的衣服，而不是芭蕾舞鞋和天鹅绒的超短连衣裙。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Morning off. Of course, it would be today. Bloody agency nurse came and went in six seconds flat. If this snow keeps on I'm not sure what we'll do later." He shrugged, as if these things couldn't be helped, and disappeared back down the corridor, apparently relieved that he no longer had to be responsible. "You know what he needs, yes?" he called over his shoulder.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他上午请假了。凑巧了，刚好是今天。该死的中介护士来了又走了，一共才用了六秒。要是这雪一直下，我不知道我们接下来该怎么办。”他耸耸肩，好像对这些事情无能为力，接着退回到走廊，显然对于他不用再负责感到欣慰。“你知道他需要些什么，是吗？”他回过头问道。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I took off my coat and shoes and, as I knew Mrs Traynor was in court (she marked her dates on a diary in Will's kitchen), I put my wet socks over a radiator to dry. A pair of Will's were in the clean-washing basket, so I put them on. They looked comically large on me but it was heaven to have warm, dry feet. Will didn't respond when I called out, so after a while I made him up a drink, knocked quietly and poked my head round the door. In the dim light I could just make out the shape under the duvet. He was fast asleep.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我脱下外套和鞋，我知道特雷纳夫人在法院（在厨房里的一本日记上她标记出来了），我把湿袜子拿到暖气片上烤。清洗篮里放着一双威尔的袜子，我拿来穿上了。他的袜子穿在我脚上很大，有些滑稽，不过脚又干又暖，真有在天堂的感觉。我叫威尔时，他没有回应。过了一会儿我调好他的饮料，轻轻地敲了下门，在门边四处看了看。微弱的光线下，我只能根据羽绒被撑起的形状分辨出下面有人。他睡得很熟。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I took a step backwards, closed the door behind me, and began working my way through the morning's tasks.</div>

<div class="line_en">My mother seemed to glean an almost physical satisfaction from a well-ordered house. I had been vacuuming and cleaning daily for a month now, and I still couldn't see the attraction. I suspected there would never be a point in my life when I wouldn't prefer somebody else to do it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在一间整洁有序的屋子里，我母亲似乎能获得身体上的满足。我做了一个月的清洗，仍然没有感觉到那种吸引力。我想在我的生活中我会一直选择让别人干这些活儿。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But on a day like today, when Will was confined to bed, and the world seemed to have stilled outside, I could also see there was a kind of meditative pleasure in working my way from one end of the annexe to the other. While I dusted and polished, I took the radio from room to room with me, keeping the volume low so that I didn't disturb Will. Periodically I poked my head round the door, just to see that he was breathing, and it was only when we got to one o'clock and he still hadn't woken up that I started to feel a little anxious.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是像今天这样的日子，威尔只能待在床上，外面的世界好像也停止了，从配楼的这头忙活到那一头，也让我感到一种冥想的快乐。除尘擦拭东西时，我一直带着收音机，从一个房间到另一个房间，我把音响调得很小，免得吵到威尔。我不时伸头到门边，他睡着了，到一点时还没有醒，让我感到一丝忧虑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I filled the log basket, noting that several inches of snow had now settled. I made Will a fresh drink, and then knocked. When I knocked again, I did so loudly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我把木柴篓装满，外面的雪有好几英寸深了。我又给威尔调了杯新鲜的饮料，然后敲门。这回我敲得很大声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The room was shadowed, the curtains still drawn. I walked in, letting my eyes adjust to the light. Will was on one side, one arm bent in front of him as if to prop himself up, as he had been before when I looked in. Sometimes it was easy to forget he would not be able to turn over by himself. His hair stuck up on one side, and a duvet was tucked neatly around him. The smell of warm, unwashed male filled the room -- not unpleasant, but still a little startling as part of a working day.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="房间很暗，窗帘还没有拉开。我走进去，眼睛适应着光线。威尔一只胳膊支在身前，似乎要支撑起自己。他有时很容易就会忘记他不能自己翻身。他的头发都竖立在一边，羽绒被整齐地掖在他旁边。温暖而没有清洗过的男人的味道充斥着整个房间——并不让人讨厌，只是作为工作日的开始，有点让人惊愕。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm hardly doing the Dance of the Seven Veils."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他使劲咽了一口口水，似乎很痛苦。“扶我起来帮我转动方向，然后抬起床的后面。这儿……”他点头示意我走得更近些。“把你的胳膊放在我的下面，抱住我的背往后拉。你坐在床上，这样就不会拉伤你的后背。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Nothing." I took a breath, linked my hands, and adjusted my position until I felt I had him securely. He was broader than I had expected, somehow heavier. And then, on a count of three, I pulled back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没事。”我吸了口气，扣住双手，调整着我的位置，直到我觉得已经很安稳地抱住了他。他比我料想的更魁梧，也更重。然后，数到三下，我往后拉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I couldn't pretend this wasn't a bit weird. I reached around him, the scent of him filling my nostrils, his skin warm against mine. I could not have been in any closer unless I had begun nibbling on his ear. The thought made me mildly hysterical, and I struggled to keep myself together.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我不能假装这一点都不怪异。我环住他，他的味道注入我的鼻孔，他温暖的肌肤贴着我的。我不能离他更近了，不然就该咬住他的耳朵了。这个想法让我觉得好笑，我竭力保持镇定。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I was half joking, but now I realized his skin was hot under his T-shirt -- an intense heat that seemed to come from deep within him. He groaned slightly as I adjusted him against the pillow, and I tried to make my movements as slow and gentle as possible. He pointed out the remote control device that would bring his head and shoulders up. "Not too much, though," he murmured. "A bit dizzy."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我半开玩笑地说。他T恤下面的肌肤火烫——巨大的热量似乎来自他身体的深处。我调整着他的姿势，让他靠住枕头，他轻轻地呻吟着，我尽可能地让我的动作缓慢轻柔。他告诉我遥控装置可以提起他的头和肩。“不过，幅度别太大，”他喃喃道，“头有点晕。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He closed his eyes, and for a while I just stood in the doorway and watched him, his chest rising and falling under his T-shirt, his mouth slightly open. His breathing was shallow, and perhaps a little more laboured than on other days. But I had never seen him out of his chair, and I wasn't sure whether it was something to do with the pressure of lying down.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他闭上双眼，我站在门口看着他，他的胸脯起起伏伏，嘴巴微张着。他的呼吸急促，或许比其他时候更辛苦。我从未见过他离开轮椅，不知道这是不是跟他躺着受到的压迫有关。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I read my magazine, lifting my head only to watch the snow settle thickly around the house, creeping up the window sills in powdery landscapes. Mum sent me a text message at 12.30pm, telling me that my father couldn't get the car down the road. "Don't set out for home without ringing us first," she instructed. I wasn't sure what she thought she was going to do -- send Dad out with a sledge and a St Bernard?</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="我听了听广播里的本地新闻，意外的暴风雪引发了高速公路上的交通阻塞、火车停运、学校暂时停课。我回到威尔的房间，又瞧着他。他脸色苍白，两颊上都闪着亮光。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I didn't feel I could protest. But I found it hard not to feel squeamish as Nathan peeled down the waist of Will's pyjama bottoms, revealing a pale strip of bare stomach, and carefully removed the gauze dressing around the little tube in his abdomen, cleaning it gently and replacing the dressing. He showed me how to change the bag on the bed, explained why it must always be lower than Will's body, and I was surprised at how matter-of-fact I was about walking out of the room with the pouch of warm fluid. I was glad that Will wasn't really watching me -- not just because he would have made some sharp comment, but because I felt that me witnessing some part of this intimate routine would in some way have embarrassed him too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我觉得我没法反对，但是很难不觉得恶心，内森脱下威尔的睡裤，露出一截苍白的肚皮，小心地除去他腹部旁边小管子上的纱布，轻轻地清洗，更换敷料。他展示给我看怎么更换床上的袋子，解释给我听，为什么它通常都必须比威尔的身体位置低些。实际上我想的是我一会儿要拿着一袋温热的液体走出房间。我很高兴威尔没有在看我——不仅仅是怕他来些刻薄的话，而且是我见证了他部分的私密程序多多少少也会让他有些尴尬。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Will endured all this attention in near silence, answering Nathan's questions with a yes or no, so indistinct sometimes that I wasn't sure if he knew what he was saying. I realized, now I could see him in the light, that he looked really, properly ill and I felt terrible for having failed to grasp it. I said sorry until Nathan told me it had become irritating.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="威尔几近沉默地忍受着这一切，用“是”或“不是”回答着内森的问题，声音含糊，有时我都怀疑他是否知道他在说什么。现在在灯下我能看清他，他看起来真的非常糟糕，我为没能发现这一点感到极其难受。我不停地说着“对不起”，直到内森说我让他很烦。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It took almost forty minutes for Will's temperature to return to an acceptable level. While we waited for the extra-strong fever medication to take effect, I placed a towel over his forehead and another around his neck, as Nathan instructed. We stripped him down, covered his chest with a fine cotton sheet, and set the fan to play over it. Without sleeves, the scars on his arms were clearly exposed. We all pretended I couldn't see them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="几乎花了四十分钟，威尔的体温才回到可接受的水平。在等待药效极强的退烧药见效的过程中，我在他的前额放了块毛巾，按照内森吩咐的，也在他的颈后放了块毛巾。我们脱去他的衣服，在他的胸口盖上了一块薄薄的棉被单，让电扇对着它吹。除去了袖子，他胳膊上的疤痕清晰可见。我们都假装视而不见。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="内森走后，我待在威尔的房间。我很担心，不得不待在这里。角落里有一张旧皮椅，旁边有一盏阅读用的小灯，或许在威尔出事之前就存在。我蜷曲在上面，读着从书柜上抽出来的一本短篇小说集。">查看中文翻译</div>

Inside it was warm and silent, only the odd tick and hiss of the central heating to interrupt my thoughts. I read, and occasionally I glanced up and checked Will sleeping peacefully and I realized that there had never been a point in my life before where I had just sat in silence and done nothing. You don't grow up used to silence in a house like mine, with its never-ending vacuuming, television blaring, and shrieking. During the rare moments that the television was off, Dad would put on his old Elvis records and play them at full blast. A cafe too is a constant buzz of noise and clatter.</div>
