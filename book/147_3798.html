<div class="line_en">With fine enthusiasm, but poor judgment, Eugene paid the widow two months in advance. Her name was Bradley: she was a flabby petulant woman with a white face and heart-disease. But her food was excellent. Mrs. Bradley's student son answered to his initial letters --"G. T." G. T. Bradley, a member of the sophomore class, was a surly scowling youth of nineteen -- a mixture, in equal parts, of servility and insolence. His chief, but thwarted, ambition was to be elected to membership in a fraternity. Having failed to win recognition by the exercise of his natural talents, he was driven by an extraordinary obsession that fame and glory would come to him if he were known as the slave-driver of a number of Freshmen.</div>

<div class="line_en">Before his first year was ended, the boy had changed his lodging four or five times. He finished the year living alone in a big bare carpetless room -- an existence rare at Pulpit Hill, where the students, with very few exceptions, lived two or three to a room. In that room began a physical isolation, hard enough to bear at first, which later became indispensable to him, mind and body.</div>

<div class="line_en">But these tactics, tried on Eugene, produced at once defiance and resentment. Their hostility was bitter: G. T. set himself to thwart and ruin the beginnings of the boy's university life. He trapped him into public blunders, and solicited audiences to witness his humiliation; he wheedled his confidence and betrayed it. But there is a final mockery, an ultimate treachery that betrays us into shame; our capacity for villainy, like all our other capacities, is so small. The day came when Eugene was free from bondage. He was free to leave the widow's house of sorrow. G. T. approached him, scowling, diffidently.</div>

<div class="line_en">He thrust his hand out stiffly. Eugene looked at the hard weak face, the furtive, unhappy eyes casting about for something they might call their own. The thick black hair was plastered stiff with grease; he saw white points of dandruff at the roots. There was an odor of talcum powder. He had been borne and nourished in the body of his white-faced mother -- for what? To lap the scornful stroking fingers of position; to fawn miserably before an emblem. Eugene had a moment of nausea.</div>

<div class="line_en">Jim Trivett, the son of a rich tobacco farmer in the eastern part of the State, was a good tempered young tough of twenty years. He was a strong, rather foul-looking boy, with a coarse protruding mouth, full-meated and slightly ajar, constantly rayed with a faint loose smile and blotted at the comer with a brown smear of tobacco juice. He had bad teeth. His hair was light-brown, dry, and unruly: it stuck out in large untidy mats. He was dressed in the last cheap extreme of the dreadful fashion of the time: skin-tight trousers that ended an inch above his oxford shoes exposing an inch of clocked hose, a bobtailed coat belted in across his kidneys, large striped collars of silk. Under his coat he wore a big sweater with high-school numerals.</div>

<div class="line_en">Jim Trivett lived with several other students from his community in a lodging-house near Mrs. Bradley's but closer to the west gate of the university. There were four young men banded together for security and companionship in two untidy rooms heated to a baking dryness by small cast-iron stoves. They made constant preparations for study, but they never studied: one would enter sternly, announcing that he had "a hell of a day tomorrow," and begin the most minute preparations for a long contest with his books: he would sharpen his pencils carefully and deliberately, adjust his lamp, replenish the red-hot stove, move his chair, put on an eye-shade, clean his pipe, stuff it carefully with tobacco, light, relight, and empty it, then, with an expression of profound relief, hear a rapping on his door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉姆·屈维特和几个同乡的学生住在尤金隔壁的一间公寓里，地点靠近大学的西门。为了安全和结伴起见，他们四个青年分住在两间不整洁的屋子里，室内烧着小铁炉，把屋子烘烤得又干又热。他们不停地为读书学习作准备，但却从来没有真正地实施过。有时候某个人会一本正经地走进来宣布说：“明天的课真不好对付。”然后便忙着做好各种微小的准备工作，好像要与书本一决高下似的：他会仔细、认真地把铅笔削好，调好台灯的位置，再往烧得通红的炉子里加点柴火，把椅子挪正，戴上眼罩，擦净烟斗，格外仔细地塞满烟丝，一次又一次地点上火，抽上两口后再把它倒空。这时候忽然听见有人在敲门，他就会如释重负般地从功课中解脱出来了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They had turned away from the centre of the dreary tobacco town. For a quarter of an hour they had walked briskly through drab autumnal streets, descending finally a long rutted hill that led them, past a thinning squalor of cheap houses, almost to the outskirts. It was three weeks before Christmas: the foggy air was full of chill menace. There was a brooding quietness, broken by far small sounds. They turned into a sordid little road, unpaved, littered on both sides with negro shacks and the dwellings of poor whites. It was a world of rickets. The road was unlighted.

<div class="line_en">There had been a faint closed noise from the house: voices and laughter, and the cracked hoarse tone of an old phonograph.

There was no light save that of the coals; but, by their dim steady glow, he could make out the old and ugly wall-paper, stained with long streaks of water rust, and scaling, in dry tattered scrolls, here and there.

<div class="line_en">Presently he heard the woman's slow heavy tread upon the stairs: she entered in a swimming tide of light, bearing a lamp before her. She put the lamp down on a table and turned the wick. He could see her now more plainly. Lily was a middle-aged country woman, with a broad heavy figure, unhealthily soft. Her smooth peasant face was mapped with fine little traceries of wrinkles at the corners of mouth and eyes, as if she had worked much in the sun. She had black hair, coarse and abundant. She was whitely plastered with talcum powder. She was dressed shapelessly in a fresh loose dress of gingham, unbelted. She was dressed like a housewife, but she conceded to her profession stockings of red silk, and slippers of red felt, trimmed with fur, in which she walked with a flat-footed tread.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不大一会儿，他听见那个女人缓慢而沉重的脚步声，她正踩着楼梯上来。她的手里举着一盏油灯，在曳动的光影里走进了房门。她把灯放在桌子上，捻亮了灯芯。此时候，他能更加清楚地看到她了。莉丽是个中年乡下女人，身材宽大而粗壮。她虽然举止温柔，但并不够健康。她那张农家妇女的脸庞光洁而细腻，但是在眼角和嘴角的地方布满了皱纹，好像太阳底下长期劳作过的人一样。她一头乌黑的头发又浓又密，脸上涂了厚厚的一层粉底霜。她随便披着一件新换洗的、宽松的方格花布外衣，没系腰带。她的装束就像个普通的家庭主妇。不过由于职业关系，她的腿上穿了一双红色的丝袜，脚上穿着一双饰有毛边的红呢拖鞋，走路的时候喜欢拖着双足。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The woman fastened the door, and returned to the hearth where the boy was now standing. He embraced her with feverish desire, fondling her with his long nervous hands. Indecisively, he sat in the rocker and drew her down clumsily on his knee. She yielded her kisses with the coy and frigid modesty of the provincial harlot, turning her mouth away. She shivered as his cold hands touched her.</div>

He clung more closely to Jim Trivett, drawing a sad pleasure from his coarse loyal praise. His unappeased desire began to burn anew: it conquered his bodily disgust and made new pictures.

<div class="line_en">When he went home for Christmas, his loins were black with vermin. The great body of the State lay like a barren giant below the leaden reek of the skies. The train roared on across the vast lift of the Piedmont: at night, as he lay in his berth, in a diseased coma, it crawled up into the great fortress of the hills. Dimly, he saw their wintry bulk, with its bleak foresting. Below a trestle, silent as a dream, a white rope of water coiled between its frozen banks. His sick heart lifted in the haunting eternity of the hills. He was hillborn. But at dawn, as he came from the cars with the band of returning students, his depression revived. The huddle of cheap buildings at the station seemed meaner and meaner than ever before. The hills, above the station flats, with their cheap propped houses, had the unnatural closeness of a vision. The silent Square seemed to have rushed together during his absence, and as he left the car and descended the street to Dixieland, it was as if he devoured toy-town distances with a giant's stride.</div>

<div class="line_en">He did not know where to turn. He paced his chill room at night, muttering, until Eliza's troubled face appeared above her wrapper. His father was gentler, older than he had ever seen him; his pain had returned on him. He was absent and sorrowful. He talked perfunctorily with his son about college. Speech choked in Eugene's throat. He stammered a few answers and fled from the house and the vacant fear in Gant's eyes. He walked prodigiously, day and night, in an effort to command his own fear. He believed himself to be rotting with a leprosy. And there was nothing to do but rot. There was no cure. For such had been the instruction of the moralists of his youth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他不知道该去找谁求助。夜深人静的时候，他站起身在冰冷的房间里来回走动起来，嘴里喃喃自语着。伊丽莎身上披了一件睡衣，神情不安地跑过来。父亲甘特比以往温和了一些，但同时也比以前更加苍老了。老头子的病痛常常复发，但是他却心不在焉、愁眉苦脸的，一谈起大学里发生的事，他往往也只是寥寥几句，不愿意多谈。尤金心里虽然有话要说，但却哽在喉咙里，只结结巴巴地答上几句，然后就跑到屋外去，不愿意看见父亲空洞的双眼，这让他恐惧不已。他成天都在外面溜达，想以这种方式把自己心中的恐惧压制下去。他坚信自己患了麻风病，身体会一天天地腐烂下去，别无他法，无药可救，因为这些都是他小时候听道学先生们讲的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He walked with aimless desperation, unable to quiet for a moment his restless limbs. He went up on the eastern hills that rose behind Niggertown. A winter's sun labored through the mist. Low on the meadows, and high on the hills, the sunlight lay on the earth like milk.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他漫无目的、绝望地在外面闲逛，脚步一刻也不停歇。他爬上东山坡的黑人区。冬天的太阳挣扎着从雾里露出脸来。在山下的草场上，在高处的山顶上，阳光像牛奶一样倾泻了一地。">查看中文翻译</div>

During the remainder of his holiday, he plunged recklessly through the lively crowds, looking boldly but without insolence at the women and young girls. They grew unexpectedly out of the waste drear winter like splendid flowers. He was eager and alone. Fear is a dragon that lives among crowds -- and in armies. It lives hardly with men who are alone. He felt released -- beyond the last hedge of desperation.</div>

<div class="line_en">In April the nation declared war on Germany. Before the month was out, all the young men at Pulpit Hill who were eligible -- those who were twenty-one -- were going into service. At the gymnasium he watched the doctors examine them, envying the careless innocence with which they stripped themselves naked. They threw off their clothes in indifferent heaps and stood, laughing and certain, before the doctors. They were clean-limbed, sound and white of tooth, graceful and fast in their movements. The fraternity men joined first -- those merry and extravagant snobs of whom he had never known, but who now represented for him the highest reach of urbane and aristocratic life. He had seen them, happy and idle, on the wide verandas of their chapter houses -- those temples where the last and awful rites of initiation were administered. He had seen them, always together, and from the herd of the uninitiated always apart, laughing over their mail at the post-office, or gambling for "black cows," at the drug-store. And, with a stab of failure, with regret, with pain at his social deficiency, he had watched their hot campaigns for the favor of some desirable freshman -- some one vastly more elegant than himself, some one with blood and with money. They were only the sons of the little rich men, the lords of the village and county, but as he saw them go so surely, with such laughing unconstraint, in well-cut clothes, well-groomed, well-brushed, among the crowd of humbler students, who stiffened awkwardly with peasant hostility and constraint -- they were the flower of chivalry, the sons of the mansion-house. They were Sydney, Raleigh, Nash. And now, like gentlemen, they were going to war.</div>

He read Defoe, Smollet, Stern, and Fielding -- the fine salt of the English novel lost, during the reign of the Widow of Windsor, beneath an ocean of tea and molasses. He read the tales of Boccaccio, and all that remained of a tattered copy of the Heptameron. At Buck Benson's suggestion, he read Murray's Euripides (at the time he was reading the Greek text of the Alcestis -- noblest and loveliest of all the myths of Love and Death). He saw the grandeur of the Prometheus fable -- but the fable moved him more than the play of Æschylus. In fact, Æschylus he found sublime -- and dull: he could not understand his great reputation. Rather -- he could. He was Literature -- a writer of masterpieces. He was almost as great a bore as Cicero -- that windy old moralist who came out so boldly in favor of Old Age and Friendship. Sophocles was an imperial poet -- he spoke like God among flashes of lightning: the dipus Rex is not only one of the greatest plays in the world, it is one of the greatest stories. This story -- perfect, inevitable, and fabulous -- wreaked upon him the nightmare coincidence of Destiny. It held him birdlike before its great snake-eye of wisdom and horror.

<div class="line_en">O God! O God! We have been an exile in another land and a stranger in our own. The mountains were our masters: they went home to our eye and our heart before we came to five. Whatever we can do or say must be forever hillbound. Our senses have been fed by our terrific land; our blood has learned to run to the imperial pulse of America which, leaving, we can never lose and never forget. We walked along a road in Cumberland, and stooped, because the sky hung down so low; and when we ran away from London, we went by little rivers in a land just big enough. And nowhere that we went was far: the earth and the sky were close and near. And the old hunger returned -- the terrible and obscure hunger that haunts and hurts Americans, and that makes us exiles at home and strangers wherever we go.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="天哪！天哪！我们在异域流浪，成了自己土地上的陌生人。这里的群山是我们的主宰，我们还不足五岁的时候，这里的一切已经深深地映入眼底，留在我们的心底。我们所说、所做的一切，都离不开这些群山。我们的官能历来深受这片神奇土地的滋养；我们的血液一直随着美利坚雄伟的脉搏流动，即使有朝一日离开了这里，我们也永不会失却、忘记它。我们沿着坎伯兰郡上的一条公路朝前行进，头顶上的苍穹压得很低，我们只好弯下了腰；而当年我们从伦敦出发的时候，沿着一条小河流前行，觉得那块土地好大啊。那时候，无论我们走到什么地方都会觉得非常遥远，天和地十分接近。现在，昔日里所有的渴望重又出现——这是一种可怕而模糊的渴望，永远萦绕在美国人的心头，并让他们伤痛不已。不管我们走到什么地方，这种渴望都会使我们成为故乡的流浪者，成为异域的陌生者。">查看中文翻译</div>

We're only two blocks from the Governor's Mansion, you know. Mrs. Mathews is no common boarding-house keeper, I can assure you! No sir!" she exclaimed, laughing. "She's a real swell -- goes to all the big functions and gets in the papers all the time. You know Hugh and I have got to try to keep up appearances. He's a young man just starting out here."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，我知道这里的房租很贵，”海伦说，“但是，我的天哪，妈妈！难道你不知道这里可是全城最好的住宅区啊？从这儿到州府大楼只隔两条街，这你是知道的。我告诉你，我们的房东马修斯夫人可不是普普通通的房东啊！绝对不是！”她边笑边说，“她可真有派头——什么宴会她都会参加，报纸上也常常能见到她的名字。你要知道，阿休和我也得撑撑场面嘛。他毕竟还年轻，在这儿又人生地不熟的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"O'Toole says he's the best agent he's got," said Helen. "Hugh's all right. We could get along together anywhere, as long as there's no damned family about. It makes me furious at times to see him slaving to feather O'Toole's pockets. He works like a dog. You know, O'Toole gets a commission on every sale he makes. And Mrs. O'T. and those two girls ride around in a big car and never turn their hands over. They're Catholics, you know, but they get to go everywhere."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“奥图尔说他是他手下最好的经纪人之一，”海伦说，“阿休的生意做得蛮好的。只要他那些该死的家庭成员不搅和，我们俩在哪儿都能相处得很好。有时候我见阿休忙死忙活的，赚来的钱却掉进了奥图尔的腰包，真把我气得要死。他工作起来非常卖力。你知道，他每做成一笔交易，奥图尔都要抽取佣金的。奥图尔夫人和他家的两个姑娘懒得连手指都不想动，成天坐在大汽车里到处瞎逛。他们信仰的是天主教，这你是知道的，但是他们却到处闲逛。”">查看中文翻译</div>
