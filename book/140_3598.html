<div class="line_en">I found that we were to have a great many passengers, including a more than usual number of ladies. On the list were several of my acquaintances; and among other names, I was rejoiced to see that of Mr. Cornelius Wyatt, a young artist, for whom I entertained feelings of warm friendship. He had been with me a fellow-student at C -- University, where we were very much together. He had the ordinary temperament of genius, and was a compound of misanthropy, sensibility, and enthusiasm. To these qualities he united the warmest and truest heart which ever beat in a human bosom.</div>

<div class="line_en">Some years ago, I engaged passage from Charleston, S. C., to the city of New York, in the fine packet-ship "Independence," Captain Hardy. We were to sail on the fifteenth of the month (June,) weather permitting; and, on the fourteenth, I went on board to arrange some matters in my state-room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="好几年前，我订了从南卡罗来纳州的查尔斯顿到纽约的船票。那是艘叫做“独立号”的豪华邮轮。船长叫哈代。如果天气许可，我们将于当月（六月）十五日出发，所以在十四日那天，我就上船整理了一下自己订的包间。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I observed that his name was carded upon three state-rooms; and, upon again referring to the list of passengers, I found that he had engaged passage for himself, wife, and two sisters -- his own. The state-rooms were sufficiently roomy, and each had two berths, one above the other. These berths, to be sure, were so exceedingly narrow as to be insufficient for more than one person; still, I could not comprehend why there were three state-rooms for these four persons. I was, just at that epoch, in one of those moody frames of mind which make a man abnormally inquisitive about trifles; and I confess, with shame, that I busied myself in a variety of ill-bred and preposterous conjectures about this matter of the supernumerary state-room. It was no business of mine, to be sure; but with none the less pertinacity did I occupy myself in attempts to resolve the enigma. At last I reached a conclusion which wrought in me great wonder why I had not arrived at it before. "It is a servant, of course," I said; "what a fool I am, not sooner to have thought of so obvious a solution!" And then I again repaired to the list -- but here I saw distinctly that no servant was to come with the party; although, in fact, it had been the original design to bring one -- for the words "and servant" had been first written and then overscored. "Oh, extra baggage to be sure," I now said to myself -- "something he wishes not to be put in the hold -- something to be kept under his own eye -- ah, I have it -- a painting or so -- and this is what he has been bargaining about with Nicolino, the Italian Jew." This idea satisfied me, and I dismissed my curiosity for the nonce.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我注意到有三个特别客舱的门卡上写着他的名字；再对照旅客名单，我发现那是他为本人、妻子和他的两个妹妹订的。特等客舱相当宽敞，每间有两个铺位，是上下铺。当然，铺位很窄，只能容下一个人，即便如此，我还是想不通为什么这四个人要订三个特等客舱。彼时彼刻，我的心灵恰好处于不可理喻的状态，对琐细小事异乎寻常的好奇。尽管心怀羞愧，我还是承认，当时，我确实对那间多余的客舱做了种种荒唐拙劣的推测。当然，这不关我的事，可我依然一门心思想去解开这个谜团。最终我得出了一个结论——我奇怪为什么自己没有早些想到它。“当然是个仆人，”我说，“我真傻，这么显而易见的答案，怎么早没想到！”然而当我再次回去对照旅客名单，我清楚地看到这一家子没带仆人，尽管原本打算带一个的——因为名单上“及仆人”的字样起初写在那里，之后又被划掉了。“哦，一定是额外的行李，”我自言自语道，“那是他不想放在货舱，而想摆在眼皮底下的东西——哈，我明白了——八成是油画之类的东西——就是他一直和那意大利的犹太人尼可雷诺讨价还价的那幅画。”这想法令我挺满意。我暂时打消了好奇心。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Wyatt's two sisters I knew very well, and most amiable and clever girls they were. His wife he had newly married, and I had never yet seen her. He had often talked about her in my presence, however, and in his usual style of enthusiasm. He described her as of surpassing beauty, wit, and accomplishment. I was, therefore, quite anxious to make her acquaintance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我对怀亚特先生的两个姐姐很熟悉，她们是非常亲切聪明的女孩。而他新近迎娶的妻子我还未有幸得见。他曾多次带着他惯常的狂热在我面前谈及她。他描述她那非凡的美丽、她的不同一般的聪慧和成就。而我因此极为渴望能够与她结识。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On the day in which I visited the ship, (the fourteenth,) Wyatt and party were also to visit it -- so the captain informed me -- and I waited on board an hour longer than I had designed, in hope of being presented to the bride; but then an apology came. "Mrs. W. was a little indisposed, and would decline coming on board until to-morrow, at the hour of sailing."</div>

<div class="line_en">The morrow having arrived, I was going from my hotel to the wharf, when Captain Hardy met me and said that, "owing to circumstances," (a stupid but convenient phrase,) "he rather thought the 'Independence' would not sail for a day or two, and that when all was ready, he would send up and let me know." This I thought strange, for there was a stiff southerly breeze; but as "the circumstances" were not forthcoming, although I pumped for them with much perseverance, I had nothing to do but to return home and digest my impatience at leisure.</div>

<div class="line_en">The ship was crowded with passengers, and everything was in the bustle attendant upon making sail. Wyatt's party arrived in about ten minutes after myself. There were the two sisters, the bride, and the artist -- the latter in one of his customary fits of moody misanthropy. I was too well used to these, however, to pay them any special attention. He did not even introduce me to his wife; -- this courtesy devolving, per force, upon his sister Marian -- a very sweet and intelligent girl, who, in a few hurried words, made us acquainted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="船上挤满了乘客，四处是出发前的纷乱嘈杂。怀亚特一家比我晚到十来分钟。两姐妹，新娘和画家都到了——画家还是一贯孤高的样子。我对此再熟悉不过了，也就没放在心上。他甚至没把我介绍给他的妻子——这一礼节自然就落在了他的妹妹玛利安身上——她是个可爱聪明的女孩，只三言两语，我和新娘就彼此相识了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mrs. Wyatt had been closely veiled; and when she raised her veil, in acknowledging my bow, I confess that I was very profoundly astonished. I should have been much more so, however, had not long experience advised me not to trust, with too inplicit (implicit) a reliance, the enthusiastic descriptions of my friend, the artist, when indulging in comments upon the loveliness of woman. When beauty was the theme, I well knew with what facility he soared into the regions of the purely ideal.</div>

<div class="line_en">My old inquisitiveness now returned. There was no servant -- that was a settled point. I looked, therefore, for the extra baggage. After some delay, a cart arrived at the wharf, with an oblong pine box, which was everything that seemed to be expected. Immediately upon its arrival we made sail, and in a short time were safely over the bar and standing out to sea.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我原先的好奇心又浮上心头。没有仆人——这个确定无疑。于是，我就看有没有额外的行李。过了一会儿，码头上来了一辆马车，载着一只长方形的松木盒子，这似乎就是大家要等的东西。盒子一到，我们就起航了，很快安全穿过沙洲，驶向大海。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The box in question was, as I say, oblong. It was about six feet in length by two and a half in breadth; -- I observed it attentively, and like to be precise. Now this shape was peculiar; and no sooner had I seen it, than I took credit to myself for the accuracy of my guessing. I had reached the conclusion, it will be remembered, that the extra baggage of my friend, the artist, would prove to be pictures, or at least a picture; for I knew he had been for several weeks in conference with Nicolino: -- and now here was a box which, from its shape, could possibly contain nothing in the world but a copy of Leonardo's "Last Supper;" and a copy of this very "Last Supper," done by Rubini the younger, at Florence, I had known, for some time, to be in the possession of Nicolino. This point, therefore, I considered as sufficiently settled. I chuckled excessively when I thought of my acumen. It was the first time I had ever known Wyatt to keep from me any of his artistical secrets; but here he evidently intended to steal a march upon me, and smuggle a fine picture to New York, under my very nose; expecting me to know nothing of the matter. I resolved to quiz him well, now and hereafter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如我所言，那只盒子是长方形的，大约有六英尺长、二英尺半宽；我打量着它，尽可能做到精确仔细。盒子的形状很特别，我一看见它就为我的准确猜测自得不已。您可能还记得，我说过我那位画家朋友的额外行李应该是画，起码是一幅画。我知道，他已经和尼可雷诺会谈了几个星期——这只盒子的外观看，里面装的只能是达。芬奇《最后的晚餐》的复制品。据我所知，这幅《最后的晚餐》是由小鲁比尼于佛罗伦萨仿绘的，一度为尼可雷诺所有。我认为，关于盒子的疑问解决了。想到自己如此敏锐聪明，我窃笑不已。怀亚特对我隐瞒他的艺术秘密，这还是头一回。他显然是想出其不意，从我的眼皮子底下偷运一幅好画去纽约，还指望我对此一无所知。我决定好好挖苦他一番，好让他从此以后长点记性。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The truth is, I could not help regarding Mrs. Wyatt as a decidedly plain-looking woman. If not positively ugly, she was not, I think, very far from it. She was dressed, however, in exquisite taste -- and then I had no doubt that she had captivated my friend's heart by the more enduring graces of the intellect and soul. She said very few words, and passed at once into her state-room with Mr. W.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="事实是，我不得不说，怀亚特夫人绝对只是一个相貌平平的女人。即使不是丑的要命，我想，也差不离了。不过，她身着盛装，品味高雅——于是我确信，她必定是凭着思想和灵魂的持久魅力俘获了我朋友的心。她几乎没说什么话，很快就和怀亚特先生一起进了客舱。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For the first three or four days we had fine weather, although the wind was dead ahead; having chopped round to the northward, immediately upon our losing sight of the coast. The passengers were consequently in high spirits, and disposed to be social. I must except, however, Wyatt and his sisters, who behaved stiffly, and, I could not help thinking, uncourteously to the rest of the party. Wyatt's conduct I did not so much regard. He was gloomy, even beyond his usual habit -- in fact he was morose -- but in him I was prepared for eccentricity. For the sisters, however, I could make no excuse. They secluded themselves in their state-rooms during the greater part of the passage, and absolutely refused, although I repeatedly urged them, to hold communication with any person on board.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="起初的三四天里，天气相当不错，只是顶着风，因为海岸刚从视线里消失，我们就转向正北方行驶了。由于天气很好，旅客们兴致都很高，乐于彼此交往。不过我得把怀亚特和他的妹妹们排除在外。他们举止僵硬，我不由觉得，他们对同船乘客很粗鲁。对怀亚特的行为我不以为然。他甚至比往常还要阴郁——实际上他孤僻得更厉害了——不过我对此早已习以为常了。可他的两个妹妹也这样，实在让我琢磨不透。旅途的大部分时间里，她们都把自己关在包房里，尽管我一再力劝，她们仍坚决拒绝同船上的任何人打交道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now, I was aware that Mrs. Adelaide Curtis, of Albany, was the artist's wife's mother; -- but then I looked upon the whole address as a mystification, intended especially for myself. I made up my mind, of course, that the box and contents would never get farther north than the studio of my misanthropic friend, in Chambers Street, New York.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我明白，这位阿尔巴尼的阿德来得。柯蒂斯夫人是画家的岳母——不过我把这个地址看作是画家向我瞒天过海而故意制造的玄虚。当然，我断定，盒子和里面的东西抵达我那孤傲的朋友在纽约钱伯斯街的工作室后，绝不会再向北行。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One thing, however, annoyed me not a little. The box did not go into the extra state-room. It was deposited in Wyatt's own; and there, too, it remained, occupying very nearly the whole of the floor -- no doubt to the exceeding discomfort of the artist and his wife; -- this the more especially as the tar or paint with which it was lettered in sprawling capitals, emitted a strong, disagreeable, and, to my fancy, a peculiarly disgusting odor. On the lid were painted the words -- "Mrs. Adelaide Curtis, Albany, New York. Charge of Cornelius Wyatt, Esq. This side up. To be handled with care."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，有一件事让我很心烦。这盒子没送到多余的包房里，而是放在了怀亚特自己的房间里。它几乎把整个地面都占满了——这无疑让艺术家和他的妻子很不舒服，尤其是盒子上还用柏油或者油漆龙飞凤舞地涂上了大写字母，散发出一股刺鼻的、在我的感觉中特别令人恶心的气味。盖子上漆着如下字句——“阿德莱得。柯蒂斯夫人，阿尔巴尼，纽约。科尼利厄斯。怀亚特先生托运。此面向上，小心轻放。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mrs. Wyatt herself was far more agreeable. That is to say, she was chatty; and to be chatty is no slight recommendation at sea. She became excessively intimate with most of the ladies; and, to my profound astonishment, evinced no equivocal disposition to coquet with the men. She amused us all very much. I say "amused " -- and scarcely know how to explain myself. The truth is, I soon found that Mrs. W. was far oftener laughed at than with. The gentlemen said little about her; but the ladies, in a little while, pronounced her "a good-hearted thing, rather indifferent-looking, totally uneducated, and decidedly vulgar." The great wonder was, how Wyatt had been entrapped into such a match. Wealth was the general solution -- but this I knew to be no solution at all; for Wyatt had told me that she neither brought him a dollar nor had any expectations from any source whatever. "He had married," he said, "for love, and for love only; and his bride was far more than worthy of his love." When I thought of these expressions, on the part of my friend, I confess that I felt indescribably puzzled. Could it be possible that he was taking leave of his senses? What else could I think? He, so refined, so intellectual, so fastidious, with so exquisite a perception of the faulty, and so keen an appreciation of the beautiful! To be sure, the lady seemed especially fond of him -- particularly so in his absence -- when she made herself ridiculous by frequent quotations of what had been said by her "beloved husband, Mr. Wyatt." The word "husband" seemed forever -- to use one of her own delicate expressions -- forever "on the tip of her tongue." In the meantime, it was observed by all on board, that he avoided her in the most pointed manner, and, for the most part, shut himself up alone in his state-room, where, in fact, he might have been said to live altogether, leaving his wife at full liberty to amuse herself as she thought best, in the public society of the main cabin.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="怀亚特夫人则随和得多。我是说，她挺爱闲聊的；在海上，爱闲聊可是值得大力推荐的。她同大多数女士打成一片；而且让我大跌眼镜的是，她还毫不含糊地向男士们卖弄风情。她总是‘逗乐’我们。我说‘逗乐’——不知道该怎样说清我的意思。实际情况是，我很快发现，怀亚特夫人被讥笑的次数远比大家同她一起欢笑的次数多。男士们对她几乎不置一词，而女士们很快就断言她是“好心肠的家伙，但相貌平庸，极其无知，粗鲁不堪”。最让人费解的是，怀亚特先生怎么会同她配了对儿，简直是落入圈套。一般来说都是因为钱财——可我知道，压根不是这么回事；因为怀亚特跟我说起过，她没带给他一个子儿，也指望不了能从其他渠道得到任何好处。他说，他是为了爱情结的婚，只为了爱情，他的新娘非常值得他爱。当我想到朋友的这些表白，我坦率承认，我感到了无法言喻的困惑。他会不会是丧失了感觉？我还能怎么想呢？他，如此优雅、聪明，如此挑剔，对缺陷异常敏感，对美无比狂热！固然，这女士看起来很喜欢他——尤其是当他不在场的时候——她一再引用她那“心爱的丈夫，怀亚特先生”的话。这使她显得特别可笑。“丈夫”这个词似乎永远——套用一句她本人的妙语——永远“停泊在她的舌尖上”。同时，全船的人都看得出，他以最明显的方式回避着她，多数时候把自己独自关在船舱里。事实上，可以说他整天都把自己关在里面，一任妻子自由自在，尽情尽兴地在主舱的乘客中间肆意取乐。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">One day he came upon deck, and, taking his arm as had been my wont, I sauntered with him backwards and forwards. His gloom, however, (which I considered quite natural under the circumstances,) seemed entirely unabated. He said little, and that moodily, and with evident effort. I ventured a jest or two, and he made a sickening attempt at a smile. Poor fellow! -- as I thought of his wife, I wondered that he could have heart to put on even the semblance of mirth. At last I ventured a home thrust. I determined to commence a series of covert insinuations, or innuendoes,(1) about the oblong box -- just to let him perceive, gradually, that I was not altogether the butt, or victim, of his little bit of pleasant mystification. My first observation was by way of opening a masked battery. I said something about the "peculiar shape of that box;" and, as I spoke the words, I smiled knowingly, winked, and touched him gently with my fore-finger in the ribs.</div>

I pitied him from the bottom of my heart -- but could not, for that reason, quite forgive his incommunicativeness in the matter of the "Last Supper." For this I resolved to have my revenge.</div>

<div class="line_en">The manner in which Wyatt received this harmless pleasantry, convinced me, at once, that he was mad. At first he stared at me as if he found it impossible to comprehend the witticism of my remark; but as its point seemed slowly to make its way into his brain, his eyes in the same proportion, seemed protruding from their sockets. Then he grew very red -- then hideously pale -- then, as if highly amused with what I had insinuated, he began a loud and boisterous laugh, which, to my astonishment, he kept up, with gradually increasing vigor, for ten minutes or more. In conclusion, he fell flat and heavily upon the deck. When I ran to uplift him, to all appearance he was dead.</div>

<div class="line_en">Several circumstances occurred immediately after this fit of Wyatt's, which contributed to heighten the curiosity with which I was already possessed. Among other things, this: I had been nervous -- drank too much strong green tea, and slept ill at night -- in fact, for two nights I could not be properly said to sleep at all. Now, my state-room opened into the main cabin, or dining-room, as did those of all the single men on board. Wyatt's three rooms were in the after-cabin, which was separated from the main one by a slight sliding door, never locked even at night. As we were almost constantly on a wind, and the breeze was not a little stiff, the ship heeled to leeward very considerably; and whenever her starboard side was to leeward, the sliding door between the cabins slid open, and so remained, nobody taking the trouble to get up and shut it. But my berth was in such a position, that when my own state-room door was open, as well as the sliding door in question, (and my own door was always open on account of the heat,) I could see into the after-cabin quite distinctly, and just at that portion of it, too, where were situated the state-rooms of Mr. Wyatt. Well, during two nights (not consecutive) while I lay awake, I clearly saw Mrs. W., about eleven o'clock upon each night, steal cautiously from the state-room of Mr. W., and enter the extra room, where she remained until daybreak, when she was called by her husband and went back. That they were virtually separated was clear. They had separate apartments -- no doubt in contemplation of a more permanent divorce; and here, after all, I thought, was the mystery of the extra state-room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这事过后，紧接着又发生了几件事，加深了我本来就有的好奇。其中一件是这样的：我神经紧张——喝了太多浓茶，晚上睡得很糟糕——实际上，有两个晚上，我简直就是彻夜难眠。现在，同船上其他单身男子的房间一样，我的房门也是正对着主舱，即是餐厅。怀亚特的三个房间在后舱，与主舱隔着一道小滑门，这门即便在晚上也不上锁。因为总是刮着风，而且还不小，船向下风方向倾斜得厉害。每当右舷倾向下风时，两个船舱之间的滑门就会自动滑开。然后它也就这么开着，没人会费劲爬起来把它关上。可我的铺位很巧合，当我的舱门和滑门同时敞开（因为天热，我自己的房门总是开着），我能清楚地看到后舱，而且看到的部分，恰恰是怀亚特先生的几个舱房。在我醒着的两夜里（不是连着的），我分明看到，怀亚特夫人每晚十一点都偷偷溜出怀亚特先生的房间，走进那个空着的特别包房，一直呆到黎明，等他丈夫来叫她的时候才回去。显然，他们实际上是分居的。他们有各自的房间——毫无疑问计划着离婚，永远井水不犯河水；我一直对那间多余的舱房感到好奇，它的秘密原来是这样的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was another circumstance, too, which interested me much. During the two wakeful nights in question, and immediately after the disappearance of Mrs. Wyatt into the extra state-room, I was attracted by certain singular, cautious, subdued noises in that of her husband. After listening to them for some time, with thoughtful attention, I at length succeeded perfectly in translating their import. They were sounds occasioned by the artist in prying open the oblong box, by means of a chisel and mallet -- the latter being apparently muffled, or deadened, by some soft woollen or cotton substance in which its head was enveloped.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="还有一个情况让我很感兴趣。在那两个不眠之夜，怀亚特夫人一消失在那间特别包房里，她丈夫的房间就传出一阵异常小心、压得很低的声响。这引起了我的注意。仔细聆听一会儿，我终于成功地领悟了那声音的含义。画家在用凿子或者木槌之类的工具摸索着打开长方盒子——木槌的响声闷闷的，显然是用棉毛类的软东西蒙住了槌头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In this manner I fancied I could distinguish the precise moment when he fairly disengaged the lid -- also, that I could determine when he removed it altogether, and when he deposited it upon the lower berth in his room; this latter point I knew, for example, by certain slight taps which the lid made in striking against the wooden edges of the berth, as he endeavored to lay it down very gently -- there being no room for it on the floor. After this there was a dead stillness, and I heard nothing more, upon either occasion, until nearly daybreak; unless, perhaps, I may mention a low sobbing, or murmuring sound, so very much suppressed as to be nearly inaudible -- if, indeed, the whole of this latter noise were not rather produced by my own imagination. I say it seemed to resemble sobbing or sighing -- but, of course, it could not have been either. I rather think it was a ringing in my own ears. Mr. Wyatt, no doubt, according to custom, was merely giving the rein to one of his hobbies -- indulging in one of his fits of artistic enthusiasm. He had opened his oblong box, in order to feast his eyes on the pictorial treasure within. There was nothing in this however, to make him sob. I repeat, therefore, that it must have been simply a freak of my own fancy, distempered by good Captain Hardy's green tea. Just before dawn, on each of the two nights of which I speak, I distinctly heard Mr. Wyatt replace the lid upon the oblong box, and force the nails into their old places, by means of the muffled mallet. Having done this, he issued from his state-room, fully dressed, and proceeded to call Mrs. W. from hers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这样倾听着，我想我能准确地判断出他何时把盖子撬开——也能听出他何时把盖子移开，何时把它放在下面的铺位上。这后面一点，是从听到盒盖碰到木头床沿发出的轻微“啪嗒”声得知的——他放得非常小心，地板上没处可放。这之后是一片死寂，直到黎明我再也没听到任何动静。除非我可以说我听到了低声的啜泣或喃喃的细语，但声音很压抑，几乎听不见——当然，或许这只是我的想象。我说它像啜泣或是叹息——不过，当然了，它也可能哪一样都不是。我宁愿认为那是我的耳鸣。毫无疑问，怀亚特先生只是在依照老习惯纵情于自己的嗜好——也就是突然沉溺于对艺术的热情中了。他打开长方盒子，是为了饱览里面那幅珍贵的画作。然而里面没有任何可让他啜泣的东西。因此，我再次说明，那一定只是我自个儿的幻觉，是好心的哈迪船长的绿茶让我不对劲了。在我提到的这两个夜晚，就在破晓前，我清楚地听到怀亚特先生重新盖好盒盖，用蒙住布的木槌把钉子照原样钉好。做完这些，他就穿戴整齐地走出房间，去怀亚特夫人的房间里把她叫出来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In this trim, we rode safely enough for forty-eight hours -- the ship proving herself an excellent sea-boat, in many respects, and shipping no water of any consequence. At the end of this period, however, the gale had freshened into a hurricane, and our after-sail split into ribbons, bringing us so much in the trough of the water that we shipped several prodigious seas, one immediately after the other. By this accident we lost three men overboard, with the caboose, and nearly the whole of the larboard bulwarks. Scarcely had we recovered our senses, before the foretopsail went into shreds, when we got up a storm stay-sail, and with this did pretty well for some hours, the ship heading the seas much more steadily than before.</div>

We were, in a measure, prepared for it, however, as the weather had been holding out threats for some time.

<div class="line_en">All was now confusion and despair -- but an effort was made to lighten the ship by throwing overboard as much of her cargo as could be reached, and by cutting away the two masts that remained.

<div class="line_en">At sundown, the gale had sensibly diminished in violence, and, as the sea went down with it, we still entertained faint hopes of saving ourselves in the boats. At eight, P.

<div class="line_en">The gale still held on, however, and we saw no signs of its abating. The rigging was found to be ill-fitted, and greatly strained; and on the third day of the blow, about five in the afternoon, our mizzen-mast, in a heavy lurch to windward, went by the board. For an hour or more, we tried in vain to get rid of it, on account of the prodigious rolling of the ship; and, before we had succeeded, the carpenter came aft and announced four feet of water in the hold. To add to our dilemma, we found the pumps choked and nearly useless.</div>
