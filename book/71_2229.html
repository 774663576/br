<div class="line_en">Just as Villefort's chambers gave access to the Palais de Justice, so the Palais de Justice gave access to the prison, a sombre pile overlooked by the bell-tower of Les Accoules, which rises opposite and examines it with curiosity from every gaping aperture.</div>

<div class="line_en">Crossing the antechamber, the commissioner of police gestured to two gendarmes, who took up their positions on either side of Dantès. A door leading from the chambers of the crown prosecutor to the law courts was opened, and they went along one of those long dark corridors that inspire a shudder in all who enter them, even when they have no cause to fear.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="警官在穿过外客厅的时候对两个宪兵做了一个暗号，他们就跟上来，一个贴在邓蒂斯的右边，一个贴在他的左边。一扇通到法院去的门已打开了，他们穿过一条长长的，阴气沉沉的走廊，这条走廊的外貌，即使最胆大的人看了也会不寒而栗。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After several twists and turns in the corridor down which they went, Dantès saw a door with an iron wicket open before him. The police commissioner knocked on it with a little hammer, and the three blows sounded to Dantès as though they had been struck against his heart. The door opened and the two gendarmes gently pushed their prisoner forward, for he still hung back. Dantès crossed the awful threshold and the door closed noisily behind him. He now breathed a different atmosphere, where the air was heavy and sulphurous: he was in prison.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="拐了无数弯，邓蒂斯看见了一扇铁门。警官在门上敲了三下，邓蒂斯觉得每一下似乎都敲在他的心上一样。门开了，两个宪兵轻轻地把他向前一推，门发出一个很大的响声在他身后关上了。他吸到的空气已不再清新，而是浓浊恶臭，——他已到了狱中。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He was taken to a cell that was quite clean, despite the bars and locks; the appearance of his surroundings consequently did not arouse too much fear in him. In any case, the deputy prosecutor's words, spoken in tones that seemed to Dantès to express such concern, still echoed in his ears like a sweet promise of hope.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他被引到一个房间，虽然门窗都装着铁栏，但还算整洁，所以它的外表倒还并不使他十分惊恐；而且，维尔福似乎对他这样关切，他的话还在他的耳边，象是在允许着给他自由。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Finally, at around ten o'clock in the evening, just as he was starting to lose hope, he heard a new sound that, this time, really did seem to be coming towards his cell. And, indeed, there were steps in the corridor that halted in front of his door. A key turned in the lock, the bolts creaked and the huge mass of oak moved open, suddenly filling the room with the dazzling light of two torches, in which Dantès could see the shining sabres and muskets of four gendarmes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后，大约在十点钟左右，正当邓蒂斯开始绝望的时候，走廊上响起了脚步声，一只钥匙插入锁里转动了一下，门闩格格地响了一声，那笨重的橡木门突然打开，两支火把上的亮光洒遍了全房。借着火把的亮光，邓蒂斯看见了四个宪兵身佩闪光的佩刀和马枪。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was already four o'clock when Dantès was led into his cell. As we have already mentioned, it was March the first, so the prisoner would soon be in darkness. His hearing became more acute as his sight dimmed and, at the slightest sound which reached him, convinced that they were coming to set him free, he leapt up and took a step towards the door; but the noise soon faded as it vanished in another direction, and Dantès slumped back on to his stool.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="邓蒂斯被关入这个房间的时候是下午四点钟。我们已经说过，这是在三月一日，所以不久就到了黑夜。幽暗扩大了他听觉的敏锐。每有一个最轻微的声音，他就站起来赶快走到门边，以为他们是来释放他了，但声音渐渐沉寂，邓蒂斯又再颓然倒在他的坐位上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The carriage stopped, the police officer got down and went across to the guardroom. A dozen soldiers emerged and formed ranks. Dantès could see their rifles shining in the reflection from the dockside lamps.</div>

<div class="line_en">The prisoner looked at the windows, which were barred: he had merely exchanged one prison for another, with the difference that this one was moving and taking him to some unknown destination. However, through the bars which were so closely set that a hand could barely pass between them, Dantès could observe that they were proceeding down the Rue Caisserie, then the Rue Saint-Laurent and the Rue Taramis, heading towards the port.</div>

<div class="line_en">The prisoner's first reaction at finding himself outside had been one of joy. The open air was almost freedom. He drew deep breaths, to fill his lungs with the sharp breeze that carries on its wings all the unknown perfumes of the night and the sea. Soon, however, he sighed: they were rowing in front of the same Réserve where he had been so happy that very morning in the hour before his arrest; and, through two brightly lit windows, he could hear the merry sounds of a ball drifting towards him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="囚徒的第一个感想是很高兴又呼吸到了清新的空气，——空气是自由的。他足足的吸了一口那生动的微风所吹来的夜与海无名的芳香。但不久他就叹了一口气，因为他正在里瑟夫酒家的前面经过，这天早晨他在那儿还是那样的快乐，而现在，从那些敞开着的窗口里，传来了他人在跳舞时所发出的欢笑和喧哗声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The soldiers watched Dantès go past with a look of dumb curiosity. In an instant he was placed in the stern of the boat, still between the four gendarmes, while the officer stood in the bow. With a violent shudder, the boat was pushed away from the quay and four oarsmen began to row vigorously towards the Pillon. At a cry from the boat, the chain across the entrance to the port was lowered and Dantès found himself in the area known as the Frioul, that is to say, outside the harbour.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="士兵们带着一种惊奇的神气望着邓蒂斯。刹那间，他已被宪兵们夹持着坐在船尾，差官坐在船头。船一篙被撑开，四个壮健的桨手推着它迅速地向皮隆方面划去。船上一声喊，封锁港口的铁索就垂了下来，一转眼，他们已在港口外面。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The two gendarmes who were sitting on the front bench got out first; then he himself was taken out, followed by those who had been sitting beside him. They set off towards a dinghy that a boatman of the Customs was holding against the quay by a chain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="坐在他对面的两个宪兵先下来，然后他被命令下车，左右两边的宪兵跟在他后面。他们向一艘小船走去，那条船是一个海关关员的，用一条铁链系在码头旁边。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你们押我到哪儿去？”他问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The boat continued on its way. It had passed by the Tête du Maure and was opposite the cove of the Pharo. It was about to round the Battery, and this Dantès could not understand.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你不久就会知道。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Being half a soldier himself, Dantès knew that it was ridiculous to ask questions of subordinates who had been forbidden to reply, so he kept silent.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="邓蒂斯知道去向奉令不得作答的下属提出问题是最无聊的举动，所以也就沉默了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">However, the strangest ideas crowded through his brain. Since they could not go far in a boat of this size, and there was no ship at anchor in the direction towards which they were heading, he thought that they must be going to put him ashore on some distant part of the coast and tell him he was free. He was not bound, and no attempt had been made to handcuff him: this seemed like a good sign. In any case, had not the deputy prosecutor told him that, provided he did not mention the dread name of Noirtier, he had nothing to fear? Had not Villefort, in his very presence, destroyed the dangerous letter which was the only proof they had against him?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="十分奇怪的一些想法穿入他的脑子。他们所乘的这只小船不能作长途航行；港口外面也没有大帆船停泊着；他想，他们或许要在某个很偏僻的地方放走他。他没有被绑，他们也毫无要给他上手铐的模样，这似乎是一个好兆头。而且，那曾这样仁慈待他的代理检察官不是告诉过他，说要是他不提到诺梯埃这个可怕的名字，他就什么都不必怕的吗？维尔福不是当他的面把那封致命的信，那攻击他的惟一证据销毁了吗？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">On their right, they had left behind the Ile Ratonneau, with its lighthouse, and, almost following the line of the coast, they had arrived opposite the bay of the Catalans. Here, the prisoner looked with still greater intensity: here Mercédès lived and he felt at every instant that he could see the vague and ill-defined shape of a woman on the dark shore. Was it possible that Mercédès had been warned by some presentiment that her lover was going by, only three hundred yards away?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们已经过兰顿纽岛，那儿也有一座灯塔，竖立在他们右边，现在已到正对迦太兰村的海面。在囚徒眼中，他好象在沙滩上影约地辨出一个女人的身影，因为美茜蒂丝就住在那儿。美茜蒂丝怎么会不预感到她的爱人就在她的附近呢？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was only one light burning in the Catalan village. By studying its position, Dantès realized that it came from his fiancée's room. Mercédès was the only person still awake in the whole of the little colony. If the young man were to shout loudly, his fiancée might hear him. But a false feeling of shame prevented him. What would these men who were watching him say, if he cried out like a madman?</div>

<div class="line_en">The light disappeared behind a small hill. Dantès turned around and noticed that they were making for the open sea. While he had been looking ashore, taken up with his thoughts, sails had been substituted for the oars and the boat was now being driven before the wind.</div>

And finally, it must be admitted that death in the bilge of an open boat at the hands of a gendarme struck him as ugly and grim. So he fell back on to the planks of the vessel with a cry of rage, gnawing at his fists in his fury.</div>

An iron hand seemed to have nailed him to the very spot where he had stopped the night before: only his deep-set eyes were now hidden behind the swelling caused by the moisture of his tears. He was motionless, staring at the floor. He had spent the whole night in this way, standing, and not sleeping for an instant.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Here is your room for tonight," he said. "It is late and the governor has gone to bed.

<div class="line_en">Before Dantès could open his mouth to reply, let alone see where the jailer was putting the bread or the place where the jar stood, and look over to the corner where the straw was waiting to make him a bed, the jailer had taken the lamp and, shutting the door, denied the prisoner even the dim light that had shown him, as though in a flash of lightning, the streaming walls of his prison.

<div class="line_en">One thought struck him with particular force. It was this: that during the crossing when, not knowing where they were taking him, he had remained so calm and docile, there had been a dozen times when he could have jumped overboard and, once in the water, thanks to an ability that made him one of the most skilful divers in Marseille, have vanished beneath the waves, evaded his captors, reached the shore, fled, hidden in some deserted bay, waited for a Genoese or Catalan ship, gone to Italy or Spain, and from there written to Mercédès to join him. As for a livelihood, he had no misgivings in any country: good sailors are everywhere in short supply. He spoke Italian like a Tuscan and Spanish like a son of Old Castile. He would have lived in freedom, happy, with Mercédès and with his father -- because his father would come to join them. Yet here he was, a prisoner, shut up in this impregnable fortress, in the Château d'If, not knowing what had become of his father or what had become of Mercédès, and all because he had trusted Villefort's word. Dantès thought he would go mad, and he rolled in fury on the fresh straw that his jailer had brought him.</div>

<div class="line_en">The tone of Dantès' voice as he said this showed the jailer that his prisoner would be happy to die; and, as every prisoner, when all is said and done, represents roughly ten sous a day for his jailer, the man considered the loss that he would suffer from Dantès' death and continued in milder vein: "Listen, what you want is impossible, so don't ask for it again: it is unheard of for the governor to come into a cell at a prisoner's request.
