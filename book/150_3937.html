<div class="line_en">The night was sultry and Kitty sat at the window looking at the fantastic roofs, dark against the starlight, of the Chinese temple, when at last Walter came in. Her eyes were heavy with weeping, but she was composed. Notwithstanding all there was to harass her she felt, perhaps only from exhaustion, strangely at peace.</div>

<div class="line_en">She gave a little shudder, for it was the first time he had admitted his intention. But she bore him no ill will for it. Her feeling surprised herself; there was a certain admiration in it and a faint amusement. She did not quite know why, but suddenly thinking of Charlie Townsend he seemed to her an abject fool.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她颤抖了一下，这是他第一次承认他的企图。然而此时此刻她却没有恨他的感觉，这让她自己都吃了一惊。在她的感觉里面甚至带有欣赏和愉悦的成分，她不知为何猛然想到了唐生，现在他在她看来简直就是一个卑鄙可怜的蠢蛋。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“嗯，可是你没有。而且你活得好像如鱼得水。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It was a terrible risk you were taking," she answered. "With your sensitive conscience I wonder if you could ever have forgiven yourself if I had died."</div>

<div class="line_en">She had an instinct to throw herself on the mercy of his humour. After all they had gone through, when they were living amid these scenes of horror and desolation, it seemed inept to attach importance to the ridiculous act of fornication. When death stood round the corner, taking lives like a gardener digging up potatoes, it was foolishness to care what dirty things this person or that did with his body. If she could only make him realize how little Charlie meant to her, so that now already she had difficulty in calling up his features to her imagination, and how entirely the love of him had passed out of her heart! Because she had no feeling for Townsend the various acts she had committed with him had lost their significance. She had regained her heart and what she had given of her body seemed not to matter a rap. She was inclined to say to Walter: "Look here, don't you think we've been silly long enough? We've sulked with one another like children. Why can't we kiss and be friends? There's no reason why we shouldn't be friends just because we're not lovers."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她冲动地附和了他的讽刺。他们已经一起经历了很多，成天面对着周围一幕幕恐怖、败落的景象，再在一出丑闻上纠缠不清是否有些不合时宜呢？死神在每一个角落里徘徊，像园丁挖掘土豆一样把人们的生命一个个地带走，现在还把此男彼女的身家是否清白揪住不放，是否太过愚蠢了呢？她怎样才能使他相信，查理在她心目中其实早已经一文不值。她甚至连他的样子也记不起来了，对他的爱早已经烟消云散。她和唐生共同度过的那些时光，已经失去了往日的光彩，变成了一堆尘灰粪土。她的心回来了，即便她的肉体曾经红杏出墙，那又算得了什么呢？她几乎控制不住想对瓦尔特说：“看着我，你觉得我们的傻事还做得不够吗？我们像孩子一样相互置气。为什么我们不能吻一下对方，从此化干戈为玉帛呢？我们没有相互爱着对方，但这并不能妨碍我们成为朋友。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He stood very still and the lamplight made the pallor of his impassive face startling. She did not trust him; if she said the wrong thing he would turn upon her with such an icy sternness. She knew by now his extreme sensitiveness, for which his acid irony was a protection, and how quickly he could close his heart if his feelings were hurt. She had a moment's irritation at his stupidity. Surely what troubled him most was the wound to his vanity: she vaguely realized that this is the hardest of all wounds to heal. It was singular that men attached so much importance to their wives' faithfulness; when first she had gone with Charlie she had expected to feel quite different, a changed woman; but she had seemed to herself exactly the same, she had experienced only well-being and a greater vitality. She wished now that she had been able to tell Walter that the child was his; the lie would have meant so little to her, and the assurance would have been so great a comfort to him. And after all it might not be a lie: it was funny, that something in her heart which had prevented her from giving herself the benefit of the doubt.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他一动不动地站在那里，灯光打在他的脸上，使那张淡漠的脸白得吓人。她还不能确认他有那个诚意。万一她说的是错话，他会毫不留情地给她脸色看。如今她知道他的心敏感至极，尖酸刻薄只是他保护自己的盾牌，一旦事不利己，他的心就会迅速地收回去，继而给自己戴上一副面具。他的愚蠢简直叫她气急败坏。显而易见，最让他难以释怀的还是虚荣心受到的打击，她隐隐觉得那恐怕是所有伤害中最难痊愈的了。男人们最怕太太给他们戴绿帽子，想想也真可笑。她第一次跟查理约会的时候，原本期望自己实现人生的飞跃，换回一个崭新的自己。然而事与愿违，除了精神上感觉安宁、活泼了一点，其他都还是老样子。现在她希望那会儿她对瓦尔特说的是孩子是他的，谎言在她看来不算什么，而对他来说将是莫大的安慰。况且这很可能还不是谎言，很奇怪，当时她的心里涌出了某种东西，不让她说出那句她将受益匪浅的回答。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">How silly men were! Their part in procreation was so unimportant; it was the woman who carried the child through long months of uneasiness and bore it with pain, and yet a man because of his momentary connexion made such preposterous claims. Why should that make any difference to him in his feeling towards the child? Then Kitty's thoughts wandered to the child which she herself would bear; she thought of it not with emotion nor with a passion of maternity, but with an idle curiosity.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="男人是多么愚蠢啊！他们在生养儿女的过程中扮演的是如此微不足道的角色，是女人怀胎十月，历尝辛苦，最后在痛苦中妊娠生产。男人们只是在开始的时候做出了那么一点点的贡献，之后却要对孩子要求如此之大的权利，实在是荒诞不经。孩子亲生与否，对他们来说真的那么重要吗？凯蒂的思绪转移到了她怀着的这个孩子身上，她既非满怀深情，也非出于母爱的天性，而仅仅是觉得好奇。">查看中文翻译</div>
