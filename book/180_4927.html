<div class="line_en">To her son these words conveyed an extraordinary joy, as if it were settled, the expedition were bound to take place, and the wonder to which he had looked forward, for years and years it seemed, was, after a night's darkness and a day's sail, within touch. Since he belonged, even at the age of six, to that great clan which cannot keep this feeling separate from that, but must let future prospects, with their joys and sorrows, cloud what is actually at hand, since to such people even in earliest childhood any turn in the wheel of sensation has the power to crystallise and transfix the moment upon which its gloom or radiance rests, James Ramsay, sitting on the floor cutting out pictures from the illustrated catalogue of the Army and Navy stores, endowed the picture of a refrigerator, as his mother spoke, with heavenly bliss. It was fringed with joy. The wheelbarrow, the lawnmower, the sound of poplar trees, leaves whitening before rain, rooks cawing, brooms knocking, dresses rustling -- all these were so coloured and distinguished in his mind that he had already his private code, his secret language, though he appeared the image of stark and uncompromising severity, with his high forehead and his fierce blue eyes, impeccably candid and pure, frowning slightly at the sight of human frailty, so that his mother, watching him guide his scissors neatly round the refrigerator, imagined him all red and ermine on the Bench or directing a stern and momentous enterprise in some crisis of public affairs.</div>

<div class="line_en">Had there been an axe handy, a poker, or any weapon that would have gashed a hole in his father's breast and killed him, there and then, James would have seized it. Such were the extremes of emotion that Mr Ramsay excited in his children's breasts by his mere presence; standing, as now, lean as a knife, narrow as the blade of one, grinning sarcastically, not only with the pleasure of disillusioning his son and casting ridicule upon his wife, who was ten thousand times better in every way than he was (James thought), but also with some secret conceit at his own accuracy of judgement. What he said was true. It was always true. He was incapable of untruth; never tampered with a fact; never altered a disagreeable word to suit the pleasure or convenience of any mortal being, least of all of his own children, who, sprung from his loins, should be aware from childhood that life is difficult; facts uncompromising; and the passage to that fabled land where our brightest hopes are extinguished, our frail barks founder in darkness (here Mr Ramsay would straighten his back and narrow his little blue eyes upon the horizon), one that needs, above all, courage, truth, and the power to endure.</div>

<div class="line_en">"But it may be fine -- I expect it will be fine," said Mrs Ramsay, making some little twist of the reddish brown stocking she was knitting, impatiently. If she finished it tonight, if they did go to the Lighthouse after all, it was to be given to the Lighthouse keeper for his little boy, who was threatened with a tuberculous hip; together with a pile of old magazines, and some tobacco, indeed, whatever she could find lying about, not really wanted, but only littering the room, to give those poor fellows, who must be bored to death sitting all day with nothing to do but polish the lamp and trim the wick and rake about on their scrap of garden, something to amuse them. For how would you like to be shut up for a whole month at a time, and possibly more in stormy weather, upon a rock the size of a tennis lawn? she would ask; and to have no letters or newspapers, and to see nobody; if you were married, not to see your wife, not to know how your children were,-- if they were ill, if they had fallen down and broken their legs or arms; to see the same dreary waves breaking week after week, and then a dreadful storm coming, and the windows covered with spray, and birds dashed against the lamp, and the whole place rocking, and not be able to put your nose out of doors for fear of being swept into the sea? How would you like that? she asked, addressing herself particularly to her daughters. So she added, rather differently, one must take them whatever comforts one can.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“但是明天天气可能会好——我想会好的。”拉姆齐夫人说着，不耐烦地轻轻扭了一下正织着的一只红棕色的袜子。如果她今晚能够织完，如果他们明天真能到灯塔去，就要把袜子带去送给灯塔看守人的小男孩，他得了髋骨结核。还要带上一大堆旧杂志和一些烟草。其实，只要她能找得到的、四处乱放着没什么用处只会使屋子凌乱的东西，她都要拿去给那些可怜的人，使他们有点消遣的东西：他们整天坐在那儿，除了擦灯、修剪灯芯、在他们一丁点儿大的园子里耙耙弄弄之外，什么别的事情也没有，一定烦闷得要命。她常常会问，要是你被禁闭在一块网球场大小的岩石上，一呆就是一个月，遇上暴风雨天气可能时间还要长，你会有什么样的感觉？没有信件或报纸；看不到任何人；你要是结了婚，见不到妻子，也不知道孩子们怎么样——是不是生病了，有没有摔断胳膊腿；一周又一周地看着单调沉闷的波涛撞碎成飞溅的浪花，然后可怕的暴风雨来临，于是窗上布满飞沫、鸟儿撞上灯塔、整个地方都在震撼、连把头探出门外都不敢，生怕被卷人大海。要是这种情况，你会觉得怎样？她常常提出这个问题，特别是对女儿们提。她用很不一样的口气接下去说，因此，应该尽可能给他们带去一点安慰。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It's due west," said the atheist Tansley, holding his bony fingers spread so that the wind blew through them, for he was sharing Mr Ramsay's evening walk up and down, up and down the terrace. That is to say, the wind blew from the worst possible direction for landing at the Lighthouse. Yes, he did say disagreeable things, Mrs Ramsay admitted; it was odious of him to rub this in, and make James still more disappointed; but at the same time, she would not let them laugh at him. "The atheist," they called him; "the little atheist." Rose mocked him; Prue mocked him; Andrew, Jasper, Roger mocked him; even old Badger without a tooth in his head had bit him, for being (as Nancy put it) the hundred and tenth young man to chase them all the way up to the Hebrides when it was ever so much nicer to be alone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“风向正西。”无神论者坦斯利说，一面张开骨瘦如柴的手指好让风从指间穿过，他正和拉姆齐先生一起，在平台上来来回回地进行傍晚时的散步。也就是说，风来自最不利于在灯塔着陆的方向。是的，他确实爱说讨人嫌的活，拉姆齐夫人想，现在又故意重复这让人不爱听的话，使詹姆斯更加失望，实在可恶；但同时她又不允许孩子们嘲笑他。他们称他为“无神论者”，“那个小个子无神论者”。萝丝嘲弄他；普鲁嘲弄他；安德鲁、贾斯珀、罗杰嘲弄他；就连—颗牙也没有了的名狗巴杰都咬过他。原因是（按南希的说法），他是第一百一十个追随他们一直到赫布里底群岛的年轻人，而他们觉得没有外人在一起要好得多。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Nonsense," said Mrs Ramsay, with great severity. Apart from the habit of exaggeration which they had from her, and from the implication (which was true) that she asked too many people to stay, and had to lodge some in the town, she could not bear incivility to her guests, to young men in particular, who were poor as churchmice, "exceptionally able," her husband said, his great admirers, and come there for a holiday. Indeed, she had the whole of the other sex under her protection; for reasons she could not explain, for their chivalry and valour, for the fact that they negotiated treaties, ruled India, controlled finance; finally for an attitude towards herself which no woman could fail to feel or to find agreeable, something trustful, childlike, reverential; which an old woman could take from a young man without loss of dignity, and woe betide the girl -- pray Heaven it was none of her daughters!-- who did not feel the worth of it, and all that it implied, to the marrow of her bones!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“胡说！”拉姆齐夫人十分严厉地说。她能忍受他们从她那儿学来的夸张的习惯，以及暗示她请的留宿的客人太多（这是事实），以至于不得不把有些客人安顿到城里去住，但她不能容忍对客人无礼，特别是对青年男子，这些人穷得一文不名，她丈夫说他们都“极有才能”，是他的崇拜者，是来他们这里度假的。确实，她把所有的男性都放在她的保护之下；其原因她无法解释。因为他们的骑士风度和英勇气概；因为他们所做的议定条约、统治印度、管理金融的事；最后还因为他们对她的态度，有种稚气的信赖和崇敬，没有哪个女人会觉察不到或不会因此而感到愉快。一个上年纪的女人可以接受青年男子的这种信赖和崇敬而不会失去自己的尊严，但若是一个不能刻骨铭心地感受到其价值和全部意义的年轻姑娘接受了这种信赖和崇敬，那就会是一场灾难——祈求上帝可千万别是她的女儿们。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She turned with severity upon Nancy. He had not chased them, she said. He had been asked. They must find a way out of it all. There might be some simpler way, some less laborious way, she sighed. When she looked in the glass and saw her hair grey, her cheek sunk, at fifty, she thought, possibly she might have managed things better -- her husband; money; his books. But for her own part she would never for a single second regret her decision, evade difficulties, or slur over duties. She was now formidable to behold, and it was only in silence, looking up from their plates, after she had spoken so severely about Charles Tansley, that her daughters, Prue, Nancy, Rose -- could sport with infidel ideas which they had brewed for themselves of a life different from hers; in Paris, perhaps; a wilder life; not always taking care of some man or other; for there was in all their minds a mute questioning of deference and chivalry, of the Bank of England and the Indian Empire, of ringed fingers and lace, though to them all there was something in this of the essence of beauty, which called out the as they sat at table beneath their mother's eyes, honour her strange severity, her extreme courtesy, like a queen's raising from the mud to wash a beggar's dirty foot, when she admonished them so very severely about that wretched atheist who had chased them -- or, speaking accurately, been invited to stay with them -- in the Isle of Skye.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她严厉地转问南希。他并没有追随他们，她说，他是应邀而来的。他们必须找到个办法来解决这一切。可能会有什么更简单的办法，不那么费劲的办法。她叹了一口气。当她向镜子里看去，看见自己的头发白了，面颊凹陷；五十岁了，她思忖着，也许她本来有可能把事情处理得好一点——她的丈夫、钱财、他的书籍。但是就她个人来说，她对自己的决定永远不会有丝毫的后悔，永远不会回避困难或敷衍塞责。现在她看起来令人生畏，只是在她就查尔斯·坦斯利说了这番严厉的话后，她的女儿们——普鲁、南希、萝丝——才从餐盘上抬起眼睛，默默地琢磨她们在和母亲不同的生活中逐渐形成的离经叛道的思想；也许是巴黎的生活；更为无拘无束的生活；不用总是照顾某个男人；因为在她们心里对于尊重女性和骑士风度、对于英格兰银行和印度帝国、对于戴戒指的手指和带花边的华丽服饰，都抱着无声的怀疑。尽管对她们来说这一切中包含着本质的美，呼唤出她们少女心中的男子气概，使她们在母亲的目光下坐在餐桌旁时，对她奇怪的严厉、对她像女王把乞丐的一只脏脚从泥浆里拿出来洗净那样的极度谦恭有礼产生了崇敬之情；母亲因为她们谈到那个一直追随她们到——或更确切地说，被邀请到——斯凯岛来的讨厌的无神论者而这样极其严厉地告诫她们，也使她们产生了崇敬之情。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"There'll be no landing at the Lighthouse tomorrow," said Charles Tansley, clapping his hands together as he stood at the window with her husband. Surely, he had said enough. She wished they would both leave her and James alone and go on talking. She looked at him. He was such a miserable specimen, the children said, all humps and hollows. He couldn't play cricket; he poked; he shuffled. He was a sarcastic brute, Andrew said. They knew what he liked best -- to be for ever walking up and down, up and down, with Mr Ramsay, and saying who had won this, who had won that, who was a "first rate man" at Latin verses, who was "brilliant but I think fundamentally unsound," who was undoubtedly the "ablest fellow in Balliol," who had buried his light temporarily at Bristol or Bedford, but was bound to be heard of later when his Prolegomena, of which Mr Tansley had the first pages in proof with him if Mr Ramsay would like to see them, to some branch of mathematics or philosophy saw the light of day. That was what they talked about.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“明天不可能在灯塔靠岸。”查尔斯·坦斯利双手啪的一声拍拢说道。他正和她丈夫一起站在窗口。真的，他该说够了吧。她真希望他们俩个离开，别再打搅她和詹姆斯，他们自己继续去聊。她看着他。他真是个可怜的家伙，孩子们说，满脸疙疙瘩瘩。不会打板球；他只会乱捅；他只会瞎搅。他是个爱挖苦人的可恶东西，安德鲁说。他们知道他最喜欢什么——没完没了地和拉姆齐先生来来回回地散步，说说谁赢得了这，谁赢得那，谁在拉丁文诗歌上是“一流人物”，谁“才华横溢，但我认为在基本论述方面不扎实”，谁毫无疑问是“巴利奥尔最有才干的人”，谁现在在布里斯托尔或贝德福暂时不露峥嵘，但等到他给数学或哲学的某一分支学科所写的导论发表之时。就肯定会声名大震，如果拉姆齐先生想看的话，坦斯利先生这里有这篇文章头几页的校样。他们谈论的就是这些东西。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Strife, divisions, difference of opinion, prejudices twisted into the very fibre of being, oh, that they should begin so early, Mrs Ramsay deplored. They were so critical, her children. They talked such nonsense. She went from the dining-room, holding James by the hand, since he would not go with the others. It seemed to her such nonsense -- inventing differences, when people, heaven knows, were different enough without that. The real differences, she thought, standing by the drawing-room window, are enough, quite enough. She had in mind at the moment, rich and poor, high and low; the great in birth receiving from her, half grudging, some respect, for had she not in her veins the blood of that very noble, if slightly mythical, Italian house, whose daughters, scattered about English drawing-rooms in the nineteenth century, had lisped so charmingly, had stormed so wildly, and all her wit and her bearing and her temper came from them, and not from the sluggish English, or the cold Scotch; but more profoundly, she ruminated the other problem, of rich and poor, and the things she saw with her own eyes, weekly, daily, here or in London, when she visited this widow, or that struggling wife in person with a bag on her arm, and a note-book and pencil with which she wrote down in columns carefully ruled for the purpose wages and spendings, employment and unemployment, in the hope that thus she would cease to be a private woman whose charity was half a sop to her own indignation, half a relief to her own curiosity, and become what with her untrained mind she greatly admired, an investigator, elucidating the social problem.</div>

But no, he wanted nothing. His hands clasped themselves over his capacious paunch, his eyes blinked, as if he would have liked to reply kindly to these blandishments (she was seductive but a little nervous) but could not, sunk as he was in a grey-green somnolence which embraced them all, without need of words, in a vast and benevolent lethargy of well-wishing; all the house; all the world; all the people in it, for he had slipped into his glass at lunch a few drops of something, which accounted, the children thought, for the vivid streak of canary-yellow in moustache and beard that were otherwise milk white. No, nothing, he murmured.</div>

Holding her black parasol very erect, and moving with an indescribable air of expectation, as if she were going to meet some one round the corner, she told the story; an affair at Oxford with some girl; an early marriage; poverty; going to India; translating a little poetry "very beautifully, I believe," being willing to teach the boys Persian or Hindustanee, but what really was the use of that?-- and then lying, as they saw him, on the lawn.</div>

<div class="line_en">It flattered him; snubbed as he had been, it soothed him that Mrs Ramsay should tell him this. Charles Tansley revived. Insinuating, too, as she did the greatness of man's intellect, even in its decay, the subjection of all wives -- not that she blamed the girl, and the marriage had been happy enough, she believed -- to their husband's labours, she made him feel better pleased with himself than he had done yet, and he would have liked, had they taken a cab, for example, to have paid the fare. As for her little bag, might he not carry that? No, no, she said, she always carried THAT herself. She did too. Yes, he felt that in her. He felt many things, something in particular that excited him and disturbed him for reasons which he could not give. He would like her to see him, gowned and hooded, walking in a procession. A fellowship, a professorship, he felt capable of anything and saw himself -- but what was she looking at? At a man pasting a bill. The vast flapping sheet flattened itself out, and each shove of the brush revealed fresh legs, hoops, horses, glistening reds and blues, beautifully smooth, until half the wall was covered with the advertisement of a circus; a hundred horsemen, twenty performing seals, lions, tigers… Craning forwards, for she was short-sighted, she read it out…"will visit this town," she read. It was terribly dangerous work for a one-armed man, she exclaimed, to stand on top of a ladder like that -- his left arm had been cut off in a reaping machine two years ago.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Let's go," he said, repeating her words, clicking them out, however, with a self-consciousness that made her wince. "Let us all go to the circus." No. He could not say it right. He could not feel it right. But why not? she wondered. What was wrong with him then? She liked him warmly, at the moment. Had they not been taken, she asked, to circuses when they were children? Never, he answered, as if she asked the very thing he wanted; had been longing all these days to say, how they did not go to circuses. It was a large family, nine brothers and sisters, and his father was a working man. "My father is a chemist, Mrs Ramsay. He keeps a shop." He himself had paid his own way since he was thirteen. Often he went without a greatcoat in winter. He could never "return hospitality" (those were his parched stiff words) at college. He had to make things last twice the time other people did; he smoked the cheapest tobacco; shag; the same the old men did in the quays. He worked hard -- seven hours a day; his subject was now the influence of something upon somebody -- they were walking on and Mrs Ramsay did not quite catch the meaning, only the words, here and there… dissertation… fellowship… readership… lectureship. She could not follow the ugly academic jargon, that rattled itself off so glibly, but said to herself that she saw now why going to the circus had knocked him off his perch, poor little man, and why he came out, instantly, with all that about his father and mother and brothers and sisters, and she would see to it that they didn't laugh at him any more; she would tell Prue about it. What he would have liked, she supposed, would have been to say how he had gone not to the circus but to Ibsen with the Ramsays. He was an awful prig -- oh yes, an insufferable bore. For, though they had reached the town now and were in the main street, with carts grinding past on the cobbles, still he went on talking, about settlements, and teaching, and working men, and helping our own class, and lectures, till she gathered that he had got back entire self-confidence, had recovered from the circus, and was about (and now again she liked him away on both sides, they came out on the quay, and the whole bay spread before them and Mrs Ramsay could not help exclaiming, "Oh, how beautiful!" For the great plateful of blue water was before her; the hoary Lighthouse, distant, austere, in the midst; and on the right, as far as the eye could see, fading and falling, in soft low pleats, the green sand dunes with the wild flowing grasses on them, which always seemed to be running away into some moon country, uninhabited of men.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“咱们都去。”他重复她的话说，然而他说时一字一蹦很不自然，使她感到惊异。“咱们去看马戏吧。”不，他没法把话说对劲。他的感觉也不对劲。可这是为什么呢？她很奇怪，他这是怎么啦？在那一刻她热情地喜欢他。她问他，他们小的时候没有人带他们去看过马戏吗？从来没有，他答道，好像他正希望她这么问，他的回答正是这些日子以来他一直盼着想说的话：他们为什么没有看过马戏。他们家人多，有九个兄弟姐妹，他父亲得干活养家。“我父亲是个药剂师，拉姆齐夫人，他开了个药铺。”他自己从十三岁起就独立谋生了，冬天常常没有大衣穿，读大学时永远也无法对款待过他的人“加以回报”（这些是他干巴生硬的原话）。他不得不使自己的东西用的时间比别人的长一倍，抽最便宜的烟草，粗烟丝，码头上老头吸的那种。他非常勤奋——一天干七个小时；目前他研究的课题是什么东西对什么人的影响——他们一直在边说边走，拉姆齐夫人没太听明白他的意思，只是断断续续地抓住了一些词……学位论文……研究员的地位……审稿人的位置……讲师的职务。她无法领会那随口滔滔而出的讨厌的学院行话，但是她对自己说，现在她明白了，为什么说起看马戏他的得意劲儿就没有了，可怜的小伙子，还有为什么他马上就说出了关于他父母和兄弟姐妹的一切，她可得叫他们别再嘲笑他；她得把这事告诉普鲁。她猜想他所希望的是能对别人说他怎样和拉姆齐一家人去看易卜生的戏了。他真是个书呆子——是的，一个让人无法忍受的乏味的家伙。而且，他们已经到了城里，来到了主街上，马车在圆石铺的路面上嘎嘎驶过，他却仍然不住嘴地说着，谈什么新居住区、教学、劳动者、帮助自己的阶级、讲座啦等等，直讲得她得出结论他已经完全恢复了自信，回到了马戏团事件前的状态，并且就要告诉她（她现在又热情地喜欢他了）——但这时两边的房屋已被他们抛在了身后，他们来到了码头上，整个海湾展现在了面前。拉姆齐夫人禁不住惊呼道，“啊，多美呀！”眼前是一片无垠的碧蓝的海水，古老的灰白色的灯塔庄重地耸立在远处海中；右边，长满飘拂的野草的绿色沙丘伸向目力所及的远方，低低地此起彼伏，逐渐模糊消失，似乎在不停地逃往某个人迹末至的仙乡。">查看中文翻译</div>

There indeed, only a few paces off, stood one of them, in Panama hat and yellow boots, seriously, softly, absorbedly, for all that he was watched by ten little boys, with an air of profound contentment on his round red face gazing, and then, when he had gazed, dipping; imbuing the tip of his brush in some soft mound of green or pink. Since Mr Paunceforte had been there, three years before, all the pictures were like that, she said, green and grey, with lemon-coloured sailing-boats, and pink women on the beach.</div>

Under the influence of that extraordinary emotion which had been growing all the walk, had begun in the garden when he had wanted to take her bag, had increased in the town when he had wanted to tell her everything about himself, he was coming to see himself, and everything he had ever known gone crooked a little.
