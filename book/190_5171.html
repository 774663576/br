<div class="line_en">For some reason the Dodger did not want to enter London during daylight, so it was nearly eleven o'clock at night when They got near the centre. Oliver had never seen a dirtier or more miserable place. The streets in this district were narrow and muddy, and there were terrible smells everywhere. Children wandered around even at this time of night, in and out of the many shops, playing and screaming. The pubs were full of people fighting, and big, evil-looking men stood in doorways or at dark corners. Oliver almost wanted to run away, but just then the Dodger pushed open a door and pulled Oliver into a dark hall.</div>

<div class="line_en">They went up some dark and broken stairs. Oliver could hardly see where he was going, but the Dodger seemed to know the way, and helped Oliver up. They entered a room with walls that were black with age and dirt. In front of the fire was a table with a candle stuck into a bottle of beer, and an old man, with a horribly ugly face and red hair, stood next to the fire cooking. He was wearing a dirty old coat and seemed to divide his attention between his cooking and a number of silk handkerchieves, which were hanging near the fire. There were several rough beds in the room. Four or five boys, about the same age as the Artful Dodger, sat round the table, smoking and drinking like middle-aged men. They all looked up when the Dodger and Oliver entered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们踩着漆黑、破烂的楼梯走上去，奥利弗几乎什么也看不见，全靠神偷扶着他往前走，而神偷显得对这儿挺熟的。他们走进了一间屋子，由于年代已久，屋子的墙又黑又脏。炉前的桌子上放了一瓶啤酒，瓶口插着一节蜡烛。一位长着非常丑恶的脸和红头发的老人站在火炉旁煮饭。他穿了一件破旧、肮脏的大衣，好像一边煮着饭一边注意着挂在炉旁边的几条丝手帕。屋里摆着几张简陋的床。四五个与插翅神偷年龄差不多的男孩围坐在桌子旁，像中年人一样嘴里叼着烟，喝着酒。神偷和奥利弗走进来时，他们都抬起头来看着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This seemed to be a joke, as the old gentleman and all his young friends gave loud shouts of laughter. Then supper began. Oliver ate his share of the food and was then given a glass of gin-and-water. Fagin told him to drink it fast. Immediately afterwards, Oliver felt himself lifted onto one of the beds and he sank into a deep sleep.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这好像是一句笑话，因为老先生和他这些年轻的朋友都大笑起来。然后晚饭开始了。奥利弗吃完了他的一份，大家又给了他一杯加了水的杜松子酒。费金让他一口气喝下去。不一会儿，他觉得被人抬起来放在了一张床上，便睡了过去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Fagin smiled and shook Oliver's hand. Then all The young gentlemen came up to him and shook both his hands very hard, especially the hand which held his few possessions. One of the boys was particularly kind. He even put his hands in Oliver's pockets so that Oliver would not have to empty them himself when he went to bed. The boys would probably have been even more helpful, but Fagin hit them on their heads and shoulders until They left Oliver alone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="费金微笑着同奥利弗握握手，然后所有的小绅士们都走过来使劲地握着他的双手，尤其是那只拿着他仅有的几件东西的手。一个孩子特别善良，竟然把手伸进了奥利弗的衣袋里，这样奥利弗在睡觉前就无需自己费力气掏出兜里的东西了。如果不是费金使劲地敲打他们的头和肩膀，让他们不再骚扰他，他们还可能会给奥利弗更殷勤的帮助。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"We're very glad to see you, Oliver," said Fagin. "I see you're staring at the handkerchieves, my dear. Aren't there a lot? We've just taken them all out to wash them, that's all! Ha! Ha! Ha!"</div>

<div class="line_en">When he woke, it was late morning. Fagin was the only other person in the room, and he was boiling coffee in a pan. When the coffee was done, he turned towards Oliver and looked closely at the boy. Oliver was only just awake and his eyes were half-closed, so he seemed to be still fast asleep. Fagin then locked the door and from a hidden hole in the floor, he took out a small box, which he placed carefully on the table. His eyes shone as he opened it and took out a gold watch covered in jewels.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他一觉醒来，时间已近中午，屋里只有费金一个人，他正在用一个平底锅煮咖啡。咖啡煮好后，他转身仔细看了一眼奥利弗。奥利弗这时刚刚醒来，眼睛还是半闭着的，所以，好像还在沉睡着。然后费金锁上了房门，从地板上一个隐蔽的洞里拿出了一个小盒子。他将小盒子小心地放在桌子上，打开盒盖，从里面拿出了一块满镶着宝石的金表。他看着金表，眼睛发出了贪婪的光。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Fagin took out at least six more watches, as well as rings and bracelets and many other valuable pieces of jewellery. He looked at them with pleasure, then replaced them. "What a good thing hanging is!" he murmured. "Dead men can never talk, or betray old friends!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="费金又拿出了至少六块手表，还有戒指、手镯和其它一些贵重的宝石饰品。他欣喜地看着这些东西，之后，又放了回去。“绞刑是多么好的事！”他咕哝着，“人死了就再也不能开口说话了，也不能背叛老朋友了！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Aah!" he said to himself. "What fine men They were! Loyal to the end. They never told the priest where the jewels were. Nor about old Fagin. Not even at the very end. And why should They? It was already too late. It wouldn't have stopped the rope going round their necks!"</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“别担心，亲爱的。”费金说着，放下手里的刀，又成了原来那个善良的老先生了。他大笑着说：“我只是想吓唬吓唬你，亲爱的。你是个勇敢的孩子，奥利弗！你看见那些漂亮的东西了吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Oliver wondered why the old man lived in such an old, dirty place, when he had so many watches, but then he thought that it must cost Fagin a lot of money to look after the Dodger and the other boys. So he said nothing, and got up and washed. When he turned towards Fagin, the box had disappeared.</div>

<div class="line_en">After breakfast They played a very strange game. The cheerful old man put a watch in his jacket pocket, with a guard-chain round his neck, and a notebook and a handkerchief in his trouser pocket. Then he went up and down the room holding a walking stick, just like the old gentlemen who walked in the streets. Sometimes he stopped at the fireplace, and sometimes at the door, pretending to stare with great interest into shop windows. He would then constantly look round, as if afraid of thieves, touching all his pockets in such a natural and funny way that Oliver laughed until tears ran down his face. All the time, the two boys followed Fagin everywhere, and every time he turned round, They moved out of his sight so quickly that it was impossible to follow their movements.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="早饭后，他们做着一种奇特的游戏。高高兴兴的老头将一块手表揣进他的上衣兜里，将表链套在脖子上，再把一个小本和一条手帕装进裤袋里。然后他手里拄着手杖，来回地在屋里走着，就好像那些走在马路上的年老的绅士一样。他一会儿停在炉旁，一会儿停在门口处，假装饶有兴趣地看着橱窗里的东西。他不停地左顾右盼，用一种自然而滑稽的动作摸索着浑身上下的衣兜，好像是怕有小偷。奥利弗被逗得笑出了眼泪。两个男孩一直跟在费金的身后，每当他转身时，他们俩就立刻躲得没影了，让他很难跟上他们的动作。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Very good," said Oliver. The others all started laughing, though Oliver saw nothing funny in his answer. Fagin inspected the handkerchieves and told the two boys that They were extremely well made and that he was very pleased with their work.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“非常好。”奥利弗说。别人都笑了，可奥利弗并不觉得他的回答有什么好笑的。费金查看过手帕，告诉两个孩子这些手帕做工精美，并表示对他们的工作感到高兴。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Finally, the Dodger bumped into him accidentally from behind, and at that moment both boys took from him, very quickly, his watch, guard chain, handkerchief, and notebook. If the old man felt a hand in any of his pockets he cried out, and then the game began again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后，神偷偶然地从后面撞了他一下，就在这个节骨眼上，他身上的手表、表链、手帕、记事本都到了两个男孩手里。如果老头感到有手伸进兜里，他就叫一声。接着游戏又重新开始。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Later, the boys went out again to do some more work. When They had gone, Fagin turned to Oliver. "Take my advice, my dear," he said. "Make them your models.

<div class="line_en">Oliver remained in Fagin's room for many days, picking the marks and names out of the handkerchieves and sometimes playing the same game as before.

<div class="line_cn" title="奥利弗在费金的屋里待了许多天，学习拆掉手帕上的记号和名字，有时也玩和以前一样的那个游戏。一天晚上，有两位年轻的女士前来造访，他们在一起聚会，玩得非常愉快。奥利弗觉得这两个女孩非常和善友好。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The old gentleman looked quite rich; he wore gold glasses, white trousers, and had an expensive walking stick under his arm. He had picked up a book and was standing there, reading it with great concentration -- just as if he were in his own armchair at home. Oliver, his eyes wide with horror and alarm, watched as the Dodger put his hand in the old gentleman's pocket, took out a hand kerchief, and hand ed it to Charley Bates. Then the two of them ran round the corner as fast as They could.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="老先生看上去很富有，他戴着一副金边眼镜，身穿一条白色裤子，一根昂贵的手杖夹在腋下。他从书摊上拿起一本书，站在那儿专心地看着——就好像坐在家里的软椅上一样。奥利弗睁大了一双恐惧和惊慌的眼睛，看着神偷将手伸进了老先生的兜里，抽出了一条丝手帕，递给了查理·贝茨，然后两人绕过拐角尽快地跑开了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Suddenly, the whole mystery of the handkerchieves, and the watches, and the jewels, and Fagin, became clear. Oliver stood for a moment in terror, blood rushing through him until he felt he was on fire. Then, confused and frightened, he started to run. At the same time, the old gentleman, putting his hand to his pocket and realizing his hand kerchief was missing, turned round. He saw Oliver running away, so he naturally thought Oliver was the thief. With loud cries of "Stop thief!", he ran after Oliver with the book still in his hand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="顿时，关于手帕的秘密及手表、宝石和费金的事都变得一清二楚了。奥利弗害怕地在那里站了一会儿，感到浑身的血流加快了，他觉得自己在发烧。然后，迷惑和害怕使他撒腿就跑。就在这时，老先生把手伸进了裤兜里，发现手帕不见了，他转过身来，正好看见奥利弗从他身边跑开，所以，理所当然地，他认为奥利弗是小偷。他大声地喊着：“抓贼！”并追赶着奥利弗，手里仍然拿着那本书。">查看中文翻译</div>
