She has taken a job in the ticket booths this summer and she wears the official Ruby Pier uniform: a white shirt, a red vest, black stirrup pants, a red beret, and her name on a pin below her collarbone. The sight of it makes Eddie angry -- especially in front of his hotshot brother.</div>

<div class="line_en">Eddie snorts. He watches his wife organize the group. As always with Marguerite and children, his mood is lifted by her easy connection to them and dampened by her inability to bear them. One doctor said she was too nervous. Another said she had waited too long, she should have had them by age 25. In time, they ran out of money for doctors. It was what it was.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱迪用鼻子哼了一声。他望着妻子指挥着孩子们。每次看到玛格丽特融洽地同孩子们在一起，爱迪都会感到很愉快。但是，一想起她无法生育，他的心中就又会沉重起来。一个医生说，她太紧张。另一个医生说，她等得太久了，她应该在二十五岁之前生育。后来，他们没钱看医生了。事情就此不了了之。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For nearly a year now, she has been talking about adoption. She went to the library. She brought home papers. Eddie said they were too old. She said, "What's too old to a child?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="近一年来。她一直讲要领养一个孩子。她去过图书馆。把文件带回家。爱迪说他们年纪太大了。她说，“年纪大跟孩子有什么关系？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The children race to a vanilla sheet cake sitting on a nearby folding table. Marguerite leans toward Eddie and whispers, "I promised them you'd blow out all thirty-eight at once."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="孩子们争先恐后地朝着放在附近一张折叠桌上的长条香草蛋糕跑去。玛格丽特附在爱迪耳边悄声说道，“我答应他们了，你会一次把三十八根蜡烛都吹灭。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"All right," she yells now from the sheet cake. "Come on, Mr. Eddie! Blow them out. Oh, wait, wait…" She fishes in a bag and pulls out a camera, a complicated contraption with rods and tabs and a round flashbulb.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好啦，”她从长条蛋糕那里向这里喊。“来吧，爱迪先生吹蜡烛啦，噢，等等…”她从一个袋子里翻出一架照相机，那是一个很复杂的玩意儿。上面有小棍子、小薄片和一个圆形闪光灯。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She offered her hand. Eddie reached for it quickly, instinctively, as if grabbing for a falling object. Their fingers met and he had never felt such a sensation, as if flesh were forming over his own flesh, soft and warm and almost ticklish. She knelt down beside him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她伸出手来。爱迪下意识地赶紧去抓，好像去抓一个将要落地的物体。他们的手指触到一起，他感到一种从未有过的感觉，好像他的皮肉上生出了新的皮肉，柔软温暖，让人痒痒的。她在他身边跪下。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Their own wedding took place Christmas Eve on the second floor of a dimly lit Chinese restaurant called Sammy Hong's. The owner, Sammy, agreed to rent it for that night, figuring he'd have little other business. Eddie took what cash he had left from the army and spent it on the reception -- roast chicken and Chinese vegetables and port wine and a man with an accordion. The chairs for the ceremony were needed for the dinner, so once the vows were taken, the waiters asked the guests to rise, then carried the chairs downstairs to the tables. The accordion man sat on a stool. Years later, Marguerite would joke that the only thing missing from their wedding "were the bingo cards."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们自己的婚礼是在圣诞前夜举行的，在一个叫做“洪山姆”的中餐馆里灯光昏暗的二楼上。餐馆老板山姆估计，那天晚上不会有什么其他生意，所以同意把二楼租给他们。爱迪把在军队里剩下的一点钱都花在了宴会上－－烤鸡、中国青菜、葡萄牙红葡萄酒和一个手风琴手。婚礼用的椅子还要用来吃晚饭，所以，结婚宣誓刚一结束，侍应生们就让客人们起身，把椅子搬到楼下去了。手风琴手坐在一张凳子上。多年之后，玛格丽特还会开玩笑地说，他们婚礼上唯一缺少的“就是宾果游戏卡片。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">People say they "find" love, as if it were an object hidden by a rock. But love takes many forms, and it is never the same for any man and woman. What people find then is a certain love. And Eddie found a certain love with Marguerite, a grateful love, a deep but quiet love, one that he knew, above all else, was irreplaceable. Once she'd gone, he'd let the days go stale. He put his heart to sleep.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="人们找到的是某一种爱。爱迪找到的是某种与玛格丽特相守的爱，一种感激的爱，一种深切而无言的爱，一种他知道无论如何都无法代替的爱。她一走，他也就放任自己的生活。他让自己的心沉睡。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now, here she was again, as young as the day they were wed. "Walk with me," she said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="而今，她又出现了，就跟他们结婚那大一样年轻。“跟我走走吧，”她说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When the meal was finished and some small gifts were given, a final toast was offered and the accordion man packed his case. Eddie and Marguerite left through the front door. It was raining lightly, a chilly rain, but the bride and groom walked home together, seeing as it was only a few blocks. Marguerite wore her wedding dress beneath a thick pink sweater. Eddie wore his white suit coat, the shirt pinching his neck. They held hands. They moved through pools of lamplight. Everything around them seemed buttoned up tight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="饭吃完了，小礼物送完了。最后的祝酒也结束了，手风琴手收起了琴盒子。爱迪和玛格丽特从前门离开。天下着蒙蒙细雨，有些凉意，新郎和新娘一起走路回家，他们的家就在几个街区远的地方。玛格丽特穿着结婚礼服。外面套了一件厚厚的粉色毛衣。爱迪穿着一件白色西装，衬衫把他的脖子都卡痛了。他们手拉着手，在路灯投下的一团团灯影里行走。四周的一切似乎都保持缄默。人们说他们“找到了”爱，好像爱是藏在岩石下面的什么东西似的。但是，爱是千姿百态的，对任何一对男女来讲都各不相同。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Eddie tried to stand, but his bad knee buckled. She lifted him effortlessly.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="爱迪的舌头动弹不得。他只能呆呆地望着她。她完全是他记得的模样－更漂亮了，真的，因为在他最后的记忆中，她是一个比现在苍老且正受着病痛折磨的女人。他静静地站在她的身边，直到她眯缝起那双乌黑的眼睛，调皮地翘起嘴唇。">查看中文翻译</div>

They truly believe their love and their marriage is going to break all the records."</div>
