<div class="line_en">Breakfast the next morning was served in a great hall. It was like eating in a church, the ceiling was cavernous, and I felt under scrutiny, as if the hall knew I was there and I shouldn't be. I'd chosen a long table full of other students from BYU. The women were talking about the clothes they had brought. Marianne had gone shopping when she learned she'd been accepted to the program. "You need different pieces for Europe," she said.</div>

<div class="line_en">The first time I saw King's College, Cambridge, I didn't think I was dreaming, but only because my imagination had never produced anything so grand. My eyes settled on a clock tower with stone carvings. I was led to the tower, then we passed through it and into the college. There was a lake of perfectly clipped grass and, across the lake, an ivory-tinted building I vaguely recognized as Greco-Roman. But it was the Gothic chapel, three hundred feet long and a hundred feet high, a stone mountain, that dominated the scene.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="剑桥大学国王学院第一次映入眼帘时，我并没觉得自己是在做梦，但这只是因为我的想象从来不曾创造出如此宏伟壮观的东西。我的目光落在一座石雕钟塔上。我被带到钟塔前，然后穿过它进入学院。一大片修剪完美的草坪环绕着湖泊，湖对面是一座象牙色的建筑，我隐约认出是希腊罗马式风格。但它是一座哥特式教堂，长三百英尺，高一百英尺，宛若一座石山，主导了全部的风景。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I was taken past the chapel and into another courtyard, then up a spiral staircase. A door was opened, and I was told that this was my room. I was left to make myself comfortable. The kindly man who'd given me this instruction did not realize how impossible it was.</div>

<div class="line_en">I thought about rushing to my room to change out of the sweatshirt and Keds I was wearing, but I had nothing to change into. I didn't own anything like what Marianne and Heather wore -- bright cardigans accented with delicate scarves. I hadn't bought new clothes for Cambridge, because I'd had to take out a student loan just to pay the fees. Besides, I understood that even if I had Marianne's and Heather's clothes, I wouldn't know how to wear them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我考虑跑回我的房间，换掉身上的运动衣裤和帆布鞋，但我没有什么可换的。我没有一件像玛丽安和希瑟身上穿的衣服——色彩艳丽的羊毛衫，搭配精致的围巾。我没有为来剑桥添置新衣服，因为单单付学费我还得申请学生贷款。此外，即便我有玛丽安和希瑟那样的衣服，我也不知道怎么穿。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dr. Kerry appeared and announced that we'd been invited to take a tour of the chapel. We would even be allowed on the roof. There was a general scramble as we returned our trays and followed Dr. Kerry from the hall. I stayed near the back of the group as we made our way across the courtyard.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克里博士来了，他宣布我们被邀请参观教堂，甚至还可以登上屋顶。大家乱作一团，端回餐盘，跟随克里博士走出大礼堂。我待在人群后面，穿过庭院。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Heather agreed. Her grandmother had paid for her plane ticket, so she'd spent that money updating her wardrobe. "The way people dress here," she said, "it's more refined. You can't get away with jeans."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="希瑟表示同意。她的祖母为她付了机票钱，所以她把钱都花在了更新衣柜上。“这儿的人穿的衣服更讲究，”她说，“穿牛仔裤可不行了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When I stepped inside the chapel, my breath caught in my chest. The room -- if such a space can be called a room -- was voluminous, as if it could hold the whole of the ocean. We were led through a small wooden door, then up a narrow spiraling staircase whose stone steps seemed numberless. Finally the staircase opened onto the roof, which was heavily slanted, an inverted V enclosed by stone parapets. The wind was gusting, rolling clouds across the sky; the view was spectacular, the city miniaturized, utterly dwarfed by the chapel. I forgot myself and climbed the slope, then walked along the ridge, letting the wind take me as I stared out at the expanse of crooked streets and stone courtyards.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当我步入教堂，我屏住了呼吸。房间——如果这样一个空间可以被称为房间的话——太大了，仿佛能容纳整个海洋。我们被指引着穿过一扇小木门，然后上了一段狭窄的、石阶不计其数的螺旋楼梯，最后抵达屋顶。屋顶倾斜得厉害，呈倒V形，被石护栏围住。风在呼啸，连绵的云朵掠过天空；景色颇为壮观，在教堂的衬托下，整座城市显得十分渺小。我忘乎所以地爬上斜坡，然后迎风走在屋脊上，望着弯曲的街道和石砌的庭院，一片壮阔的景象。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You're not afraid of falling," a voice said. I turned. It was Dr. Kerry. He had followed me, but he seemed unsteady on his feet, nearly pitching with every rush of wind.</div>

<div class="line_en">"We can go down," I said. I ran down the ridge to the flat walkway near the buttress. Again Dr. Kerry followed but his steps were strange. Rather than walk facing forward, he rotated his body and moved sideways, like a crab. The wind continued its attack. I offered him an arm for the last few steps, so unsteady did he seem, and he took it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们可以下去了。”我说。我顺着屋脊跑到靠近扶壁的平坦的走道上。克里博士再次跟了上来，但他的脚步很奇怪。他不是朝前走，而是转动身体，像螃蟹一样侧身而行。风继续肆虐。他看上去那么站不稳，于是最后几步时我向他伸出手臂，他扶住了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I meant it as an observation," he said when we'd made it down. "Here you stand, upright, hands in your pockets." He gestured toward the other students. "See how they hunch? How they cling to the wall?" He was right. A few were venturing onto the ridge but they did so cautiously, taking the same ungainly side steps Dr. Kerry had, tipping and swaying in the wind; everyone else was holding tightly to the stone parapet, knees bent, backs arched, as if unsure whether to walk or crawl.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我观察过了，”我们下来后，他说，“你笔直地站着，双手插在口袋里。”他指了指其他学生，“看见他们是怎么耸肩弓背，紧贴墙壁的吗？”他说得对。有胆量登上屋脊的寥寥几人都小心翼翼，像克里博士那样笨拙地侧身前行，在风中倾斜摇晃；其他人都紧抓石头护栏，屈膝弓背，好像不知道是走还是爬。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He paused, as if unsure he should say more. "Everyone has undergone a change," he said. "The other students were relaxed until we came to this height. Now they are uncomfortable, on edge. You seem to have made the opposite journey. This is the first time I've seen you at home in yourself. It's in the way you move: it's as if you've been on this roof all your life."</div>

<div class="line_en">A gust of wind swept over the parapet and Dr. Kerry teetered, clutching the wall. I stepped up onto the ridge so he could flatten himself against the buttress. He stared at me, waiting for an explanation.</div>

<div class="line_en">I had to think before I could answer. "I can stand in this wind, because I'm not trying to stand in it," I said. "The wind is just wind. You could withstand these gusts on the ground, so you can withstand them in the air. There is no difference. Except the difference you make in your head."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="回答之前，我思考了片刻。“我能在风中站稳，是因为我不是努力尝试站在风中，”我说，“风就是风。人能受得了地面上的阵阵狂风，所以也能禁得住高空的风。它们没有区别。不同的是头脑中怎么想。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The first week passed in a blur of lectures. In the second week, every student was assigned a supervisor to guide their research.

<div class="line_en">My first meeting with Professor Steinberg took place a few days later. I waited at the porter's lodge until a thin man appeared and, producing a set of heavy keys, unlocked a wooden door set into the stone.

<div class="line_en">I could hear the blood pounding behind my ears as I sat down. Professor Steinberg was in his seventies but I would not have described him as an old man. He was lithe, and his eyes moved about the room with probing energy. His speech was measured and fluid.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="坐下来时，我能听到耳后的血液在跳动。斯坦伯格教授已经七十多岁了，但我不会将他描述为一位老人。他动作轻盈，目光在房间内来回扫视，充满探索的能量。他的谈吐清晰而流畅。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I mumbled something about historiography. I had decided to study not history, but historians. I suppose my interest came from the sense of groundlessness I'd felt since learning about the Holocaust and the civil rights movement -- since realizing that what a person knows about the past is limited, and will always be limited, to what they are told by others. I knew what it was to have a misconception corrected -- a misconception of such magnitude that shifting it shifted the world. Now I needed to understand how the great gatekeepers of history had come to terms with their own ignorance and partiality. I thought if I could accept that what they had written was not absolute but was the result of a biased process of conversation and revision, maybe I could reconcile myself with the fact that the history most people agreed upon was not the history I had been taught. Dad could be wrong, and the great historians Carlyle and Macaulay and Trevelyan could be wrong, but from the ashes of their dispute I could construct a world to live in. In knowing the ground was not ground at all, I hoped I could stand on it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我含糊地说想看一些史学方面的。我已下定决心不研究历史，而是研究历史学家。我想我的兴趣来自学习了大屠杀和民权运动之后的无据可依之感——意识到个人对过去的了解是有限的，并将永远局限于别人所告诉他们的。我知道误解被纠正是什么感觉——改变重大的误解便是改变了世界。现在，我需要了解那些伟大的历史看门人是如何向自己的无知和偏见妥协的。我想如果我能接受他们所写的东西不是绝对的，而是一种带有偏见的话语和修正过程的结果，也许我就可以接受这样一个事实：大多数人认同的历史不是我被教导的历史。爸爸可能是错的，伟大的历史学家卡莱尔、麦考利和特里维廉也可能是错的，但从他们争论的灰烬中，我可以构建一个世界，生活在其中。当我知道了地面根本不是地面，我希望自己能站在上面。">查看中文翻译</div>

He made no distinction between grammar and content, between form and substance.

<div class="line_en">After I'd been meeting with Professor Steinberg for a month, I wrote an essay comparing Edmund Burke with Publius, the persona under which James Madison, Alexander Hamilton and John Jay had written The Federalist Papers. I barely slept for two weeks: every moment my eyes were open, I was either reading or thinking about those texts.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在与斯坦伯格教授会面一个月后，我写了一篇论文，将埃德蒙·伯克与普布利乌斯进行比较，后者是詹姆斯·麦迪逊、亚历山大·汉密尔顿和约翰·杰伊撰写《联邦党人文集》[18]时用的笔名。我几乎有两周没怎么睡觉：睁着眼睛的每一刻，我不是在阅读，就是在思考这些文字。【注：[18]The Federalist Papers，亚历山大·汉密尔顿、约翰·杰伊和詹姆斯·麦迪逊三人为争取批准新宪法在纽约报刊上以“普布利乌斯”为笔名发表的一系列的宪法论文，首次整理结集出版于1788年。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">From my father I had learned that books were to be either adored or exiled. Books that were of God -- books written by the Mormon prophets or the Founding Fathers -- were not to be studied so much as cherished, like a thing perfect in itself. I had been taught to read the words of men like Madison as a cast into which I ought to pour the plaster of my own mind, to be reshaped according to the contours of their faultless model. I read them to learn what to think, not how to think for myself. Books that were not of God were banished; they were a danger, powerful and irresistible in their cunning.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从父亲那里我学到，书籍要么被崇拜，要么被摒弃。上帝的书——摩门教先知和开国元勋们写的书——不是用来好好研究的，而是用来好好珍惜的，因为它们堪称完美。我被教导，像麦迪逊那样的人的话，要被视为模板，我应当把自己思想的石膏倒进这个模子，按照它们完美无瑕的模型轮廓重塑自我。我读这些书是为了学习该思考什么，而不是如何自己思考。与上帝无关的书则被驱逐，它们是一种危险的存在，不可抗拒地强大而狡猾。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">To write my essay I had to read books differently, without giving myself over to either fear or adoration. Because Burke had defended the British monarchy, Dad would have said he was an agent of tyranny. He wouldn't have wanted the book in the house. There was a thrill in trusting myself to read the words. I felt a similar thrill in reading Madison, Hamilton and Jay, especially on those occasions when I discarded their conclusions in favor of Burke's, or when it seemed to me that their ideas were not really different in substance, only in form. There were wonderful suppositions embedded in this method of reading: that books are not tricks, and that I was not feeble.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="为了撰写论文，我不得不换一种方式读书，不让自己陷入恐惧或崇拜。伯克捍卫过英国君主制，因此父亲会说他是暴政的代理人，他不会允许家里有这样一本书。信任自己，去阅读这些文字，让我感到一阵激动。读麦迪逊、汉密尔顿和杰伊的作品时，我也感受到类似的兴奋，尤其是在我放弃他们的结论而支持伯克的观点，或者是在我看来他们的观点并无本质上的不同，只是形式的不同而已。这种阅读方法中植入了一些奇妙的假设：书并非儿戏，我也并不软弱。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I don't remember leaving the clock tower, or how I passed the afternoon. That evening there was a black-tie dinner. The hall was lit by candlelight, which was beautiful, but it cheered me for another reason: I wasn't wearing formal clothing, just a black shirt and black pants, and I thought people might not notice in the dim lighting. My friend Laura arrived late. She explained that her parents had visited and taken her to France. She had only just returned. She was wearing a dress of rich purple with crisp pleats in the skirt. The hemline bounced several inches above her knee, and for a moment I thought the dress was whorish, until she said her father had bought it for her in Paris. A gift from one's father could not be whorish. A gift from one's father seemed to me the definitive signal that a woman was not a whore. I struggled with this dissonance -- a whorish dress, gifted to a loved daughter -- until the meal had been finished and the plates cleared away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我不记得是怎么离开钟塔的，也不记得那个下午是怎么度过的。那天晚上有一个正式的晚宴。大礼堂被烛光照亮，很美，但我感到开心还有另一个原因：我没有着正装，只穿了黑衬衫和黑裤子，我以为在昏暗的烛光下人们可能不会注意到这一点。我的朋友劳拉姗姗来迟。她解释说她的父母来看望她，带她去了法国。她刚回来。她穿了一条深紫色的百褶裙，裙摆在她膝盖上方几英寸处。一时之间，我觉得这条裙子很淫荡，直到她说这是她父亲在巴黎给她买的。父亲送的礼物不可能淫荡。在我看来，父亲送的礼物是一个明确的信号，意味着自己的女儿不是妓女。我在这种不协调的矛盾中挣扎纠结——淫荡的裙子，送给心爱女儿的礼物——直到晚餐结束，盘子都被撤走。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In late August, on our last night in Cambridge, there was a final dinner in the great hall. The tables were set with more knives, forks and goblets than I'd ever seen; the paintings on the wall seemed ghostly in the candlelight. I felt exposed by the elegance and yet somehow made invisible by it. I stared at the other students as they passed, taking in every silk dress, every heavily lined eye. I obsessed over the beauty of them.</div>
