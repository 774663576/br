<div class="line_en">My aunt died back in about 2003. She was eighty-four and so was my uncle. When she passed he was devastated. They had been married for over 60 years. We expected him to pass on quickly after she died. He attended his church more frequently and his mourning was nearly unbearable to witness. His only daughter lived clear across the country so he had only the rest of the extended family and church family to comfort him.</div>

<div class="line_en">My cousin talked him into selling the house that he and my aunt had built together about twenty-five years before. It was very hard to part with the home they built together. He was going to move into an apartment, but at the last moment, my cousin and he saw a new house for sale, that was close to his business. She helped him buy furniture and a flat screen television. He had not watched television for years because of his religion. He was like a kid with a new toy but still grieved horribly for my aunt.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我堂姐游说伯父卖掉那栋他和伯母大概在25年前一起建造的房子。要离开他俩一起建造的“家”，这对伯父而言非常艰难。他准备搬进一间公寓，不过就在最后一刻，我堂姐和他看中了一栋待售的新房，而且这房子离伯父的公司很近。堂姐帮伯父买来了家具和一台平板电视机。由于他的宗教信仰，伯父已经很多年没有看电视了。他如同一个拿到一件新玩具的孩子那样开心，不过对于伯母的离去，他还是非常伤心。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One day he called my cousin who was living in Texas and told her that he reconnected with a lady from a church that he and my aunt went to forty years previously. She played piano and his church was looking for new music. Her husband had died about seven years previously. He said he just wanted someone to go out to dinner with and spend time with. We were happy for them but had no idea how it would turn out. They were both almost eighty-seven years old.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有一天，伯父打电话给我那住在得克萨斯州的堂姐，告诉她说他和一位女士重新取得了联系，而那位女士来自他和伯母40多年前常去的一间教堂。那位女士会弹钢琴，而伯父所在的教会正要找新的音乐伴奏。那位女士的丈夫大约七年前去世了。伯父说，他只是想有个人一起出去吃饭，一起消磨时光。我们很为他们俩高兴，却不知道结果会如何。他们俩都将近87岁高龄。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The clash in their relationship came when they neither wanted to leave their respective churches. She went to her Baptist church that she had attended for many years and he went to his, which was a Pentecostal. They decided to remain friends but nothing more. He was broken-hearted, but felt that his religion was the only way. She didn't want to leave her church and didn't like the extreme of his.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们都不愿意脱离各自的教会，这使得他们的关系出现了冲突。她去的是已经加入多年的浸礼会，而他去的是五旬节派教会。他们决定只做朋友，别无他求。对此，伯父伤心不已，不过他感到自己的信仰是唯一的抚慰方式。而她不想离开自己所在的教会，也不喜欢他的教会那么偏激。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They were like lovebirds and spent as much time together as they could. They both had one child each, she a son, he a daughter. She had a house that her father built for her when she got married to her first husband. She was content there.</div>

<div class="line_en">Before too long they realized that they did not want to be apart. They would find a new church together. They planned to marry. When he took her to a jewelry store and bought her a diamond, the employees were so impressed that they had a big write up in our own local paper, "'The Truth' for Valentines' Day." They prepared for their wedding. They moved the wedding date up because neither wanted to wait any longer to "be together," and it was not proper to "be together" without being married.</div>

It was such a beautiful refreshing thing to see, two people who you would have thought had pretty much lived their lives, were beginning a new one together. I have never seen my uncle happier. He is still in love and she loves him as much as he loves her.</div>

<div class="line_en">If you ever think that it is too late for you to find true love or your life is over, you should see more relationships like theirs. They are both still working and they have been married now for almost two years. They are both going to be ninety in the next two months, and still work part time. They love their life together. They still maintain their own home and go to church, out to eat and with their family and friends. It is never too late to find true love, again, or for the first time!</div>
