<div class="line_en">Once a father was seated at the dinner table with his wife and children. A good friend who had come to visit was eating with them. While they were sitting there the clock struck twelve, and the stranger saw the door open and a very pale little child dressed in snow-white clothes come in. It neither looked around, nor did it speak, but went straight into the next room. Soon afterwards it came back, and just as silently went out the door again.</div>

<div class="line_en">The next day when it again came, the stranger pointed it out to the father, but the latter did not see it, nor did the mother and the children see anything. Then the stranger got up, went to the door of the room, opened it a little, and looked in. There he saw the child sitting on the floor, and busily digging and rooting about in the cracks in the floor. When it saw the stranger, it disappeared.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天，那孩子又进来了，客人指着给父亲看，但他看不见，母亲和小孩一样也看不见。於是客人站了起来，走到房门旁，开了一条缝，往里瞅了瞅。他看那男孩正坐在地上，用手指头使劲地在地板缝里挖呀挖的，当他看见客人时，就消失了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Therefore it had had no rest in its grave, and had come every day at noon to look for these farthings. Then the parents gave the money to a poor man, and after that the child was never seen again.</div>

<div class="line_en">They ripped up the floor and found two farthings which the child had once received from its mother to give to a poor man. It, however, had thought, "With that money you can buy yourself a piece of zwieback," and had kept the farthings, hiding them in the cracks in the floor.</div>
