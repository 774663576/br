<div class="line_en">Every city during the Middle Ages, and every city in France down to the time of Louis XII. had its places of asylum. These sanctuaries, in the midst of the deluge of penal and barbarous jurisdictions which inundated the city, were a species of islands which rose above the level of human justice. Every criminal who landed there was safe. There were in every suburb almost as many places of asylum as gallows. It was the abuse of impunity by the side of the abuse of punishment; two bad things which strove to correct each other. The palaces of the king, the hotels of the princes, and especially churches, possessed the right of asylum. Sometimes a whole city which stood in need of being repeopled was temporarily created a place of refuge. Louis XI. made all Paris a refuge in 1467.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="中世纪的任何城市，直至路易十二（10）以前法国的任何城市，都有其避难所。这些避难所，在洪水般淹没城邦的不可胜数的刑法和野蛮司法之中，犹如孤岛，耸立在人间审判权限之上。任何罪犯一躲进去就得救了。在任何一个郊区，避难所的数量多如绞刑架。滥施免刑与滥施刑罚并肩而立，都是坏东西，却试图互相矫正。国王的宫殿、王公的府邸，尤其是教堂，都拥有施予避难权。有时整个一座城，因为人们想要增丁添口，就暂时使之成为一个避难所。路易十一在一四六七年曾使巴黎成为避难所。【注：（10）路易十二，法国国王（1498—1515），是路易十一的孙子。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His foot once within the asylum, the criminal was sacred; but he must beware of leaving it; one step outside the sanctuary, and he fell back into the flood. The wheel, the gibbet, the strappado, kept good guard around the place of refuge, and lay in watch incessantly for their prey, like sharks around a vessel. Hence, condemned men were to be seen whose hair had grown white in a cloister, on the steps of a palace, in the enclosure of an abbey, beneath the porch of a church; in this manner the asylum was a prison as much as any other. It sometimes happened that a solemn decree of parliament violated the asylum and restored the condemned man to the executioner; but this was of rare occurrence. Parliaments were afraid of the bishops, and when there was friction between these two robes, the gown had but a poor chance against the cassock.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一旦踏入避难所，罪犯就神圣不可侵犯了。不过，他必须小心翼翼不再出去。走出圣殿一步，他就重新落入了法网。碾车、绞架、吊杆（11），都在避难所周围严阵以待，不断窥伺着目标，好像鲨鱼围绕着船只。常常看见待决犯就这样在修士后院里，在宫殿楼梯下，在寺院田地上，在教堂门拱下，奄奄待毙。这样说来，避难所也是一座监狱，与真正的监狱一般无二。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sometimes, however, as in the affair of the assassins of Petit-Jean, the headsman of Paris, and in that of Emery Rousseau, the murderer of Jean Valleret, justice overleaped the church and passed on to the execution of its sentences; but unless by virtue of a decree of Parliament, woe to him who violated a place of asylum with armed force! The reader knows the manner of death of Robert de Clermont, Marshal of France, and of Jean de Châlons, Marshal of Champagne; and yet the question was only of a certain Perrin Marc, the clerk of a money-changer, a miserable assassin; but the two marshals had broken the doors of St. Méry. Therein lay the enormity.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有时候，大理寺作出庄严决定，破坏避难权，把罪犯重新交给刽子手。不过，这种事情很少有。大理寺畏惧主教。当红黑二袍发生摩擦的时候，法袍敌不过教袍。（12）但是，有时候，例如巴黎的刽子手小若望被杀一案，又如谋害若望·瓦勒莱的凶手艾默里·卢梭被害一案，司法机关跳过了教会，不去执行它的判决。然而，除非大理寺作出判决，谁要是执械侵犯避难所，就该谁倒霉！法兰西元帅罗伯·德·克莱蒙和香巴涅都统若望·德·夏隆是怎样死的，大家都知道。虽然事由只是牵涉一个卑贱的杀人犯——钱币兑换商的小厮，一个名叫佩兰·马克的家伙，可是，元帅和都统打破了圣梅里教堂的门，这就构成滔天罪行。【注：（11）酷刑用具。把犯人吊在杆上，往地上或水里砸下去。（12）红袍指法官的袍子，黑袍为教士的袍子。教权胜过王权，在法国，直至拿破仑一世才有了彻底改变。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Such respect was cherished for places of refuge that, according to tradition, animals even felt it at times. Aymoire relates that a stag, being chased by Dagobert, having taken refuge near the tomb of Saint-Denis, the pack of hounds stopped short and barked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对于避难所，当时的人尊敬备至。据传，有时甚至扩及动物。艾莫宛说过一个故事，说是达戈贝（13）追猎一只鹿，鹿避难到圣德尼坟墓附近，整群猎犬顿时站住，狂吠不已。【注：（13）公元7、8世纪法兰克人有三个国王，先后相继都叫达戈贝。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At Notre-Dame it was a tiny cell situated on the roof of the side aisle, beneath the flying buttresses, precisely at the spot where the wife of the present janitor of the towers has made for herself a garden, which is to the hanging gardens of Babylon what a lettuce is to a palm-tree, what a porter's wife is to a Semiramis.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was here that Quasimodo had deposited la Esmeralda, after his wild and triumphant course. As long as that course lasted, the young girl had been unable to recover her senses, half unconscious, half awake, no longer feeling anything, except that she was mounting through the air, floating in it, flying in it, that something was raising her above the earth. From time to time she heard the loud laughter, the noisy voice of Quasimodo in her ear; she half opened her eyes; then below her she confusedly beheld Paris checkered with its thousand roofs of slate and tiles, like a red and blue mosaic, above her head the frightful and joyous face of Quasimodo. Then her eyelids drooped again; she thought that all was over, that they had executed her during her swoon, and that the misshapen spirit which had presided over her destiny, had laid hold of her and was bearing her away. She dared not look at him, and she surrendered herself to her fate.</div>

<div class="line_en">But when the bellringer, dishevelled and panting, had deposited her in the cell of refuge, when she felt his huge hands gently detaching the cord which bruised her arms, she felt that sort of shock which awakens with a start the passengers of a vessel which runs aground in the middle of a dark night. Her thoughts awoke also, and returned to her one by one. She saw that she was in Notre-Dame; she remembered having been torn from the hands of the executioner; that Phoebus was alive, that Phoebus loved her no longer; and as these two ideas, one of which shed so much bitterness over the other, presented themselves simultaneously to the poor condemned girl; she turned to Quasimodo, who was standing in front of her, and who terrified her; she said to him,—"Why have you saved me?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，当蓬首垢面、气喘如牛的敲钟人把她抱到避难室里放下来，她感到他的大手温柔地解去死死勒住她双臂的绳索的时候，她不觉一个寒噤，好似黑夜里船碰到了海岸，旅客从睡梦中惊醒。她的记忆也惊醒了，往事一一浮现在眼前。她发现自己是在圣母院里，想起了自己是从刽子手手里抢救出来的，孚比斯还活着，孚比斯不爱她了；这两个念头同时出现在可怜的女犯的头脑里，后一个想法的辛酸压倒了前一个想法，她便转身对站在她面前、仍然使她畏惧的卡席莫多说：“您又何必救我呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She was touched and raised her head to answer him. He had disappeared. She found herself alone once more, meditating upon the singular words of this almost monstrous being, and struck by the sound of his voice, which was so hoarse yet so gentle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她十分感动，抬起头来，想回话。他却不见了踪影。又只剩下她一人，想着这个可以说是鬼怪的生物的奇特言语，他声音嘶哑、却很温存，她不由得感到奇怪。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then she examined her cell. It was a chamber about six feet square, with a small window and a door on the slightly sloping plane of the roof formed of flat stones. Many gutters with the figures of animals seemed to be bending down around her, and stretching their necks in order to stare at her through the window. Over the edge of her roof she perceived the tops of thousands of chimneys which caused the smoke of all the fires in Paris to rise beneath her eyes. A sad sight for the poor gypsy, a foundling, condemned to death, an unhappy creature, without country, without family, without a hearthstone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="随后，她仔细察看这间小室。这间房大约六尺见方，小窗子和门外面就是扁平石头的屋顶微微倾斜的坡面。水溜上雕刻的兽脸似乎在她身后探头探脑，伸长脖子从窗洞里窥视她。她顺着屋顶边缘看过去，瞅见千千万万烟突的顶梢，全城家家户户举火升烟尽收眼底。这景象（15），在可怜的埃及姑娘——这个弃婴，已被判处死刑者，没有祖国、没有家园、没有温暖家庭的不幸者看来，真是够凄凉的！【注：（15）这是从圣母院钟楼下部背侧向下俯视的景象。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At the moment when the thought of her isolation thus appeared to her more poignant than ever, she felt a bearded and hairy head glide between her hands, upon her knees. She started (everything alarmed her now) and looked. It was the poor goat, the agile Djali, which had made its escape after her, at the moment when Quasimodo had put to flight Charmolue's brigade, and which had been lavishing caresses on her feet for nearly an hour past, without being able to win a glance. The gypsy covered him with kisses. "Oh! Djali!" she said, "how I have forgotten thee! And so thou still thinkest of me! Oh! thou art not an ingrate!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这样念及自己孑然茕立，倍增刺心之痛。这时却感到有一个毛乎乎的脑袋探入她的手中，倚在她的膝头上。她一阵哆嗦（现在一切都吓她一跳），低头一看，原来是可怜的小山羊。机灵的佳利，趁卡席莫多驱散夏莫吕的押解队的空子，也跟着女主人逃跑了。现在已在她腿上蹭来蹭去将近一小时了，却未能博得主人一顾。埃及姑娘赶忙把它抱起来，吻了又吻，说道：“哦，佳利！我真把你忘了！你倒一直惦着我哩！啊，你不是忘恩负义的东西！”">查看中文翻译</div>
