<div class="line_en">And one day it occurred to her that she had neither thought of Charles Townsend nor dreamt of him for a week. Her heart gave a sudden thud against her ribs: she was cured. She could think of him now with indifference. She loved him no longer. Oh, the relief and the sense of liberation! It was strange to look back and remember how passionately she had yearned for him; she thought she would die when he failed her; she thought life thenceforward had nothing to offer but misery. And now already she was laughing. A worthless creature. What a fool she had made of herself!</div>

<div class="line_en">Kitty had a queer feeling that she was growing. The constant occupation distracted her mind and the glimpses she had of other lives and other outlooks awakened her imagination. She began to regain her spirits; she felt better and stronger. It had seemed to her that she could do nothing now but weep; but to her surprise, and not a little to her confusion, she caught herself laughing at this and that. It began to seem quite natural to live in the midst of a terrible epidemic. She knew that "eople were dying to the right and left of her, but she eased very much to think of it. The Mother Superior ad forbidden her to go into the infirmaries and the closed doors excited her curiosity. She would have liked to peep in, but could not do so without being seen, and she did not know what punishment the Mother Superior would inflict upon her. It would be dreadful to be sent away. She was devoted to the children now and they would miss her if she went; in fact she did not know what they would do without her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凯蒂有种奇怪的想法，她感觉自己在不断地成长。没完没了的工作占据了她的心思，在和别人的交往中，她接触到了新的生活，新的观念，这启发了她的思维。她的活力又回来了，她感觉比以前更健康，身体更结实。如今她什么都可以做，就是不会哭了。让她颇为惊奇而又困惑不解的是，她发觉自己时常开怀大笑。她已经习惯待在这块瘟疫肆虐的中心地带了，虽然她明知身边有人在随时死去，但是已经能叫自己不去胡思乱想。修道院长禁止她到医疗室里去，可是那扇紧闭的门越发激起她的好奇心。她很想跑过去偷偷朝里面看两眼，但是那保准会被人发现。修道院长不知会用什么方法来惩罚她呢。要是她被赶走可就太糟了，她现在专心致志地照顾那群孩子，如果她走了，她们肯定会想念她的。她真不知道要是没有了她，她们可怎么办。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Suddenly the door opened and the Mother Superior stood on the threshold. Kitty, abashed, extricated herself from the clutches of a dozen little girls who with wild shrieks had seized her.</div>

<div class="line_en">The children were playing some romping game and it was her habit to look on with an indulgent smile, restraining them when they made too much noise and taking care that in their boisterousness none was hurt; but now in her high spirits, feeling as young as any of them, she joined in the game. The little girls received her with delight. They chased up and down the room, shouting at the top of their shrill voices, with fantastic and almost barbarous glee. They grew so excited that they leaped into the air with joy. The noise was terrific.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="孩子们正在玩追逐的游戏，平时她都是微笑地看着，任由她们玩儿，只要注意别太吵闹、别磕磕碰碰了就行。现在她神清气爽，忽而觉得自己也跟她们一般年纪，上去和她们一起玩起来。她的加入让小女孩儿们异常高兴，她们满屋子里追追跑跑，使出最大的劲儿狂叫，兴奋得忘乎所以，那股劲儿都快飞到天上去了。吵闹声异常响亮，凯蒂都没注意到。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And now, considering him calmly, she wondered what on earth she had seen in him. It was lucky that Waddington knew nothing, she could never have endured his malicious eyeing and his ironical innuendoes. She was free, free at last, free! She could hardly prevent herself from laughing aloud.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在冷静地想一想，她那时到底看上他什么了？很幸运，韦丁顿对此还一无所知，不然她可受不了他那双恶毒的眼睛和那张含沙射影的嘴。她自由了，终于自由了，自由了！她都要忍不住高声欢叫起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Mother Superior came forward and as usual the children clustered about her. She put her hands round their narrow shoulders and playfully pulled their little yellow ears. She looked at Kitty with a long, soft look. Kitty was flushed and she was breathing quickly. Her liquid eyes were shining and her lovely hair, disarranged in all the struggling and the laughter, was in adorable confusion.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="修道院长走了过来，孩子们像以往一样簇拥到她的周围。她把手放在她们小小的肩膀上，揪了揪她们的小黄耳朵，然后温和地望着凯蒂。凯蒂面红耳赤，呼吸也局促起来。她亮丽的眼睛忽闪忽闪的，润泽的头发在打闹和欢笑的时候散乱了下来，显得更加妩媚动人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Come, do not be silly. Beauty is also a gift of God, one of the most rare and precious, and we should be thankful if we are happy enough to possess it and thankful, if we are not, that others possess it for our pleasure."</div>
