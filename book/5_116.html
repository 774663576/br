<div class="line_en">Now the public learned how she'd been disappointed and abandoned. They saw beyond the journalist to the woman within, and they couldn't stop talking about her. The phrase heard most often was, just like me.</div>

<div class="line_en">Before the documentary, the public respected Tully Hart. Afterward, they adored her. She graced the cover of People and Us in the same week. The documentary -- and segments from it -- were played and replayed on entertainment news shows. America, it seemed, couldn't get enough of Tully Hart.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="纪录片播出之前，观众只是敬重塔莉·哈特，现在他们爱死她了。她在同一周登上《人物》与《我们》杂志的封面，娱乐新闻不断回放这部纪录片与其中的片段，似乎整个国家都为塔莉·哈特疯狂，无法自拔且百看不厌。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The documentary aired two weeks later, and even Kate, who was used to Tully's amazing successes, was caught off guard by the public's reaction. It caused a media frenzy. For years Tully had been seen on camera as the cool, witty professional, following stories and reporting on them with her journalist's detachment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两周后，纪录片播出，即使凯蒂早已习惯塔莉的惊人成就，这次所得到的热烈回响依然令她吃惊，媒体都为之疯狂。多年来，塔莉在镜头前一直维持着沉着、机智又专业的形象，以记者特有的疏离感追踪新闻并进行报道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But while everyone was watching Tully and the sad encounter with her estranged mother, Kate saw something else entirely on that tape, and she watched it just as obsessively.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当其他人看着塔莉寻找阔别多年的母亲，看着两人之间的悲哀故事，凯蒂看到的重点截然不同，而她也同样着魔似的每播必看。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But something had happened.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而发生了那件事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She studied their body language like a primatologist, but in the end she had only what she'd had in the beginning: two old friends working together on an emotional documentary and a wife who'd worried for a long time about them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她像灵长类专家一样仔细研究他们的肢体语言，但最后得到的结论跟第一次看时相同：两个老朋友合作拍摄一部动人的纪录片。只是身为妻子的她长久以来一直太担心这两个人互有爱意，以致疑心生暗鬼。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And then there was the quiet talk Tully and Johnny had had out at Sunshine Farms. They'd edited out whatever words had been exchanged and gone to an establishing shot of the commune, but Kate couldn't help wondering what they'd said to each other.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不止这些，还有在阳光农场外面的那一幕，塔莉和强尼低声说悄悄话。对话内容被后制消音了，镜头迅速拉远拍摄农场，凯蒂忍不住猜想他们说了什么。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That should have been the end of it. If nothing else had happened, Kate would have boxed up her old jealousies and put them away again, just as she'd done dozens of times over the years.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果没有后来发生的事，凯蒂应该可以就此释怀，她会将陈年醋意重新装箱收藏，过去这些年她重复做了至少十多次。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The idea had rocked Tully's world, offered her a way to be herself on camera, to show the world who she really was and how she really felt. No more three A. M. start times, either. The minute she heard the idea, she said it was exactly what she needed, but even so, she'd put down two conditions: first, they had to shoot in Seattle; second, John Ryan had to be her producer. Neither of these had she bothered to clear with her friends.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个提议撼动了塔莉的世界，给她机会在镜头前呈现自己，让世人知道她真实的性格与感受，而且再也不需要凌晨三点起床了。一听到这个点子，她立刻表明正合她的心意，尽管如此，她依然开了两个条件：第一，节目必须在西雅图拍摄；第二，由强尼·雷恩担任制作人。这两件事她都没有事先和朋友商量。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Syndiworld, the second largest syndication company in the world, had seen the documentary and offered Tully her own one-hour show, of which she would be a majority interest owner.</div>

<div class="line_en">Now, two days later, Kate sure as hell wasn't laughing. She and Johnny were in the living room, trying to keep their voices down because the kids were in bed. Tully was back in New York, no doubt sitting by the phone, waiting to see if once again she'd get her way.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Do you understand how much money they're offering us? We could pay off this house and send the kids to Harvard for medical degrees. And I could do a few shows that mattered. Tully said I could spotlight places in the world that are in trouble. Do you know what that would mean to me?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你知道他们开的薪水有多高吗？我们可以还清房贷、送三个孩子念哈佛医学院。我还可以制作一些有意义的节目，塔莉说我可以关注世界上的问题地区，你明白那对我而言有多重要吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At their closed door she paused, taking a deep breath. She knew what she had to do now, what she had to say. She'd hurt his feelings and insulted him. They both knew this was the opportunity of a lifetime. Her insecurities and jealousy couldn't stand in the way of that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她停在紧闭的卧房门前，深吸一口气，她知道该做什么、该说什么。她伤了他的感情，也污辱了他。他们都很清楚这是一生难逢的好机会，不能因为她没安全感、胡乱吃醋而放弃。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Tully finished off her contract, had an emotional, celebrity-studded last broadcast, and said goodbye to New York. She found a new penthouse in the Emerald City and spent the next month in closed-door meetings, coming up with the plans for her new show, which she was calling The Girlfriend Hour with Tully Hart in honor of the Mularkeys' holiday tradition. She and Johnny had spent long hours working together like the old days, hiring staff and designing the set and devising show concepts.</div>

<div class="line_en">By August of 2003, much of the advance work was done and she realized that yet again she'd been so busy with work that she'd forgotten to have a life.
