<div class="line_en">During the whole of a dull, dark, and soundless day in the autumn of the year, when the clouds hung oppressively low in the heavens, I had been passing alone, on horseback, through a singularly dreary tract of country; and at length found myself, as the shades of the evening drew on, within view of the melancholy House of Usher. I know not how it was -- but, with the first glimpse of the building, a sense of insufferable gloom pervaded my spirit. I say insufferable; for the feeling was unrelieved by any of that half-pleasurable, because poetic, sentiment, with which the mind usually receives even the sternest natural images of the desolate or terrible. I looked upon the scene before me -- upon the mere house, and the simple landscape features of the domain -- upon the bleak walls -- upon the vacant eye-like windows -- upon a few rank sedges -- and upon a few white trunks of decayed trees -- with an utter depression of soul which I can compare to no earthly sensation more properly than to the after-dream of the reveller upon opium -- the bitter lapse into every-day life -- the hideous dropping off of the veil. There was an iciness, a sinking, a sickening of the heart -- an unredeemed dreariness of thought which no goading of the imagination could torture into aught of the sublime.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was possible, I reflected, that a mere different arrangement of the particulars of the scene, of the details of the picture, would be sufficient to modify, or perhaps to annihilate its capacity for sorrowful impression; and, acting upon this idea, I reined my horse to the precipitous brink of a black and lurid tarn that lay in unruffled lustre by the dwelling, and gazed down -- but with a shudder even more thrilling than before -- upon the re-modelled and inverted images of the grey sedge, and the ghastly tree-stems, and the vacant and eye-like windows.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我思量道，这片景物中的一草一木，一山一水只消在细微处布置得稍有不同，带给人的那种悲伤的感觉，可能就会减轻，或许会归于消泯。这种念头一起，我策马奔至山中小湖的险岸边。小湖就傍着宅第，湖面泛着光泽，却一丝涟漪都没有，黑黢黢，阴森森，倒映出变形的灰色芦苇、惨白树干、空洞眼睛一样的窗子。我俯视着湖面，浑身颤抖，比刚才的感觉还要奇怪。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">What was it -- I paused to think -- what was it that so unnerved me in the contemplation of the House of Usher? It was a mystery all insoluble; nor could I grapple with the shadowy fancies that crowded upon me as I pondered. I was forced to fall back upon the unsatisfactory conclusion, that while, beyond doubt, there are combinations of very simple natural objects which have the power of thus affecting us, still the analysis of this power lies among considerations beyond our depth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到底是什么原因，使得我在注目厄谢府时如此不能自控？这是个限免不了的谜。沉思间，模糊的幻想涌满心头，却又无从捉摸。我只得退而求其次，自圆其说罢了——简单的自然景物凑在一起，确实有左右人情绪的力量，但要剖析这种感染力，即便费尽心机，也是无迹可寻。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Nevertheless, in this mansion of gloom I now proposed to myself a sojourn of some weeks. Its proprietor, Roderick Usher, had been one of my boon companions in boyhood; but many years had elapsed since our last meeting. A letter, however, had lately reached me in a distant part of the country -- a letter from him -- which, in its wildly importunate nature, had admitted of no other than a personal reply. The MS. gave evidence of nervous agitation. The writer spoke of acute bodily illness -- of a mental disorder which oppressed him -- and of an earnest desire to see me, as his best, and indeed his only personal friend, with a view of attempting, by the cheerfulness of my society, some alleviation of his malady. It was the manner in which all this, and much more, was said -- it was the apparent heart that went with his request -- which allowed me no room for hesitation; and I accordingly obeyed forthwith what I still considered a very singular summons.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，目前我还是打算在这阴沉的府邸作几个星期的逗留。这座府邸的主人罗德里克。厄谢是我儿时的好朋友。我们有好多年没见过面了。可最近，我收到了一封从本国一个遥远的地方发来的信——是他写来的，信写得很急切，还非要我亲自去一趟。在他的亲笔信里，显然透着股的神经不安的味道。他提到自己患有严重的疾病——是让他备受折磨的精神错乱，还说，真的很想见到我这个最好的朋友、惟一的知己，能跟我快活地呆上一阵子，病情便会减轻云云。全信如此这般说了很多。他的请求显然出于一片真心，让人片刻都不能犹豫。于是，我马上就应邀动身了。来是来了，我却依然认为，他的召唤真是蹊跷得紧。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Although, as boys, we had been even intimate associates, yet I really knew little of my friend. His reserve had been always excessive and habitual. I was aware, however, that his very ancient family had been noted, time out of mind, for a peculiar sensibility of temperament, displaying itself, through long ages, in many works of exalted art, and manifested, of late, in repeated deeds of munificent yet unobtrusive charity, as well as in a passionate devotion to the intricacies, perhaps even more than to the orthodox and easily recognisable beauties, of musical science. I had learned, too, the very remarkable fact, that the stem of the Usher race, all time-honoured as it was, had put forth, at no period, any enduring branch; in other words, that the entire family lay in the direct line of descent, and had always, with very trifling and very temporary variation, so lain. It was this deficiency, I considered, while running over in thought the perfect keeping of the character of the premises with the accredited character of the people, and while speculating upon the possible influence which the one, in the long lapse of centuries, might have exercised upon the other -- it was this deficiency, perhaps, of collateral issue, and the consequent undeviating transmission, from sire to son, of the patrimony with the name, which had, at length, so identified the two as to merge the original title of the estate in the quaint and equivocal appellation of the "House of Usher" -- an appellation which seemed to include, in the minds of the peasantry who used it, both the family and the family mansion.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们虽然是童年时代的密友，可我对这位朋友确实知之甚少。他总是有所保留，这都成了他的习惯。不过我很清楚的是，很久以前，他的先祖就以多愁善感闻名。多少年来，这一特点总是经由高贵的艺术品体现出来；最近，则表现为举办一次又一次慷慨却不张扬的慈善活动，迷恋上音乐的复杂性，而不是热爱其一致公认、一听即懂的美。我也知道一个异乎寻常的事实，厄谢家族虽历来受人尊敬，但却从未有过不衰的旁系子孙，换句话说就是，这个家族属于一代单传，除了微乎其微、偶尔出现的例外，永远都是这样。想着这座房屋的特色跟人们普遍认定的厄谢家族的性格极其吻合，想着好几百年来，房屋的特色有可能影响到厄谢家族的性格，我不由认为，或许正是因为缺乏旁系支亲，才致使财产和姓氏总是祖孙相传，世代相袭，最后财产和姓氏终于混而为一，庄园的名称渐渐消失，一个离奇而模棱两可的名称——“厄谢府”，浮出了地表。庄稼人都用这个名称，在他们心里，这个名称似乎既包含了这个家族，又包含了这座府邸。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I have said that the sole effect of my somewhat childish experiment -- that of looking down within the tarn -- had been to deepen the first singular impression. There can be no doubt that the consciousness of the rapid increase of my superstition -- for why should I not so term it? -- served mainly to accelerate the increase itself. Such, I have long known, is the paradoxical law of all sentiments having terror as a basis. And it might have been for this reason only, that, when I again uplifted my eyes to the house itself, from its image in the pool, there grew in my mind a strange fancy -- a fancy so ridiculous, indeed, that I but mention it to show the vivid force of the sensations which oppressed me. I had so worked upon my imagination as really to believe that about the whole mansion and domain there hung an atmosphere peculiar to themselves and their immediate vicinity -- an atmosphere which had no affinity with the air of heaven, but which had reeked up from the decayed trees, and the grey wall, and the silent tarn -- a pestilent and mystic vapour, dull, sluggish, faintly discernible, and leaden-hued.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我上面说过了，俯视湖水这一略带幼稚的举止，只是加剧了早先那种奇怪的忧伤。无疑，这迅速弥漫的迷信感——何不就称之为迷信呢？——只会益发浓重。我早就晓得，惟有心里胡思乱想，才会觉得恐怖。这是个荒谬的定律。或许正是这个缘故，当我不再看那些水中倒影，再度举目望着府邸时，我的心里就生出了奇怪的幻象。那幻象是那么荒谬，真的，我提到它是想说明折磨人的种种思绪有着何其强大的威力。我这么胡思乱想着，竟然当真相信整座府邸和整片庄园都弥散着一种气息，连同附近一带都沾染了这种气息。这气息与天空中的大气迥然不同，而是从枯木、灰墙、死水中飘散而出，阴沉、迟滞、灰扑扑的模糊难辨，像瘟疫一样不可思议。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Shaking off from my spirit what must have been a dream, I scanned more narrowly the real aspect of the building. Its principal feature seemed to be that of an excessive antiquity. The discolouration of ages had been great. Minute fungi overspread the whole exterior, hanging in a fine tangled web-work from the eaves. Yet all this was apart from any extraordinary dilapidation. No portion of the masonry had fallen; and there appeared to be a wild inconsistency between its still perfect adaptation of parts, and the crumbling condition of the individual stones. In this there was much that reminded me of the specious totality of old wood-work which has rotted for long years in some neglected vault, with no disturbance from the breath of the external air. Beyond this indication of extensive decay, however, the fabric gave little token of instability. Perhaps the eye of a scrutinizing observer might have discovered a barely perceptible fissure, which, extending from the roof of the building in front, made its way down the wall in a zigzag direction, until it became lost in the sullen waters of the tarn.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我抖落掉心中那些只能说是梦幻的念头，更仔细地端详这座府邸的真正面貌。看来它的主要特征，在于年代极为古远，时光的痕迹使它褪尽了鲜亮的颜色。墙上布满微小的真菌，乱糟糟地挂在屋檐下，酷似蜘蛛网。不过倒也找不出破损得特别厉害的地方。没有一堵墙是倒塌的。各部分配合完好，整齐划一，个别石头却碎裂了，看上去非常不协调。这使我不由想起无人问津的地窖里那旧的木制品，多年来它们吹不到外面的一缕风，看似完整，实则早已腐烂多年。不过厄谢府除了表面上的衰颓，整幢建筑看上去丝毫没有摇摇欲坠的迹象。如果仔细观察，兴许能发现一条细微的裂缝，它就从正面屋顶上开始，曲曲弯弯顺墙而下，直至消失在阴沉沉的湖水中。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Noticing these things, I rode over a short causeway to the house. A servant in waiting took my horse, and I entered the Gothic archway of the hall. A valet, of stealthy step, thence conducted me, in silence, through many dark and intricate passages in my progress to the studio of his master. Much that I encountered on the way contributed, I know not how, to heighten the vague sentiments of which I have already spoken. While the objects around me -- while the carvings of the ceilings, the sombre tapestries of the walls, the ebon blackness of the floors, and the phantasmagoric armorial trophies which rattled as I strode, were but matters to which, or to such as which, I had been accustomed from my infancy -- while I hesitated not to acknowledge how familiar was all this -- I still wondered to find how unfamiliar were the fancies which ordinary images were stirring up. On one of the staircases, I met the physician of the family. His countenance, I thought, wore a mingled expression of low cunning and perplexity. He accosted me with trepidation and passed on. The valet now threw open a door and ushered me into the presence of his master.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我留意着这一切，沿着一条短短的堤道，骑马来到府邸门口。一个侍从接过马缰绳。我跨进了哥特式的大厅拱门。一个蹑手蹑脚的男仆，无声地带我穿过一道道昏暗而曲折的回廊，到主人的工作室去。不知为什么，一路上看到的景物，竟使我上面提及的那种含含糊糊的愁绪，变本加厉了。周遭的一切——天花板上的雕刻、四壁黑色的帷幔、乌黑的地板、幻影似的亦步亦趋发出“咔嗒咔嗒”声的纹章甲胄——我幼时就看惯了。我毫不犹疑地承认，一切都很熟悉，可我还是很惊讶，这些普通的物件，怎么就激起了那么陌生的幻想！在一座楼梯上，我遇见了他家的医生。他面露刁奸与困惑之色，他抖索着跟我搭了句话，便溜走了。这时男仆突然打开门，引我到他主人面前。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The room in which I found myself was very large and lofty. The windows were long, narrow, and pointed, and at so vast a distance from the black oaken floor as to be altogether inaccessible from within. Feeble gleams of encrimsoned light made their way through the trellissed panes, and served to render sufficiently distinct the more prominent objects around; the eye, however, struggled in vain to reach the remoter angles of the chamber, or the recesses of the vaulted and fretted ceiling. Dark draperies hung upon the walls. The general furniture was profuse, comfortless, antique, and tattered. Many books and musical instruments lay scattered about, but failed to give any vitality to the scene. I felt that I breathed an atmosphere of sorrow. An air of stern, deep, and irredeemable gloom hung over and pervaded all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我发现，房间极高，也很宽大，窗子狭长，尖尖地耸着，离漆黑的橡木地板老高，伸手根本触不到。几缕微弱的红光，透过格子玻璃射进来，把四下里比较显眼的物件照得清清楚楚。然而，房间远处的角落、雕花拱顶的凹陷处，却无论怎样都照射不到。墙壁上挂着深色的帷幔。家具特别多，但几乎都不舒服，又过时破旧。四处散布着书籍和乐器，却并没有给房间增添一分生机。我嗅到的只是悲伤的气息。周遭的一切都笼罩着阴沉、幽深、无可救赎的忧郁之气。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Upon my entrance, Usher arose from a sofa on which he had been lying at full length, and greeted me with a vivacious warmth which had much in it, I at first thought, of an overdone cordiality -- of the constrained effort of the ennuyé man of the world. A glance, however, at his countenance, convinced me of his perfect sincerity. We sat down; and for some moments, while he spoke not, I gazed upon him with a feeling half of pity, half of awe. Surely, man had never before so terribly altered, in so brief a period, as had Roderick Usher! It was with difficulty that I could bring myself to admit the identity of the wan being before me with the companion of my early boyhood. Yet the character of his face had been at all times remarkable. A cadaverousness of complexion; an eye large, liquid, and luminous beyond comparison; lips somewhat thin and very pallid, but of a surpassingly beautiful curve; a nose of a delicate Hebrew model, but with a breadth of nostril unusual in similar formations; a finely moulded chin, speaking, in its want of prominence, of a want of moral energy; hair of a more than web-like softness and tenuity; these features, with an inordinate expansion above the regions of the temple, made up altogether a countenance not easily to be forgotten. And now in the mere exaggeration of the prevailing character of these features, and of the expression they were wont to convey, lay so much of change that I doubted to whom I spoke. The now ghastly pallor of the skin, and the now miraculous lustre of the eye, above all things startled and even awed me. The silken hair, too, had been suffered to grow all unheeded, and as, in its wild gossamer texture, it floated rather than fell about the face, I could not, even with effort, connect its Arabesque expression with any idea of simple humanity.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="厄谢正直挺挺地躺在沙发上，见我进去，马上爬了起来，热情欢快地迎接我。我起初以为这份热诚过了火，不过是这厌世者的做作之举，可瞥了一眼他的面容，确信是出于一片真诚。我们坐了下来，有一阵子，他一语不发。我望着他，心里半是同情，半是敬畏。相信没有一个人像罗德里克。厄谢那样，在那么短的时间里，变得那么厉害。我费了好大劲才认定眼前这个人就是我幼年时代的伙伴。不过他的面部特征一直不同寻常。他面如死灰；眼睛大而清澈，明亮得无与伦比；嘴唇有点薄，颜色暗淡，但轮廓绝顶漂亮；鼻子是精致的希伯莱式样，鼻孔却大得离谱；下巴造型很好，但鲜有活力，并不引人注目；头发又软又薄，蛛网一样稀稀拉拉；这样的五官，再配上太阳穴上面异常宽阔的天庭，那容貌真是令人过目不忘。容颜上的显著特征，脸上一贯流露的神情，只消有一点夸张的地方，都会显得变化很大，如今与厄谢同处一室，我却生出了对面不相识的感觉。眼前这苍白得可怕的肤色，明亮得出奇的眼睛，尤其让我惊愕，它们甚至吓倒了我。那丝绸般柔滑的头发，也在不知不觉中，变长了，蛛丝一样纷乱，与其说是披拂在脸上，倒不如说飘飘扬扬来得贴切。任我怎么努力，也无法从这副怪异神情里，找出正常人的影子了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was thus that he spoke of the object of my visit, of his earnest desire to see me, and of the solace he expected me to afford him. He entered, at some length, into what he conceived to be the nature of his malady. It was, he said, a constitutional and a family evil, and one for which he despaired to find a remedy -- a mere nervous affection, he immediately added, which would undoubtedly soon pass off. It displayed itself in a host of unnatural sensations. Some of these, as he detailed them, interested and bewildered me; although, perhaps, the terms, and the general manner of the narration had their weight. He suffered much from a morbid acuteness of the senses; the most insipid food was alone endurable; he could wear only garments of certain texture; the odours of all flowers were oppressive; his eyes were tortured by even a faint light; and there were but peculiar sounds, and these from stringed instruments, which did not inspire him with horror.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他就那样谈着请我来的目的，说他如何诚心诚意地盼着我，希望我给他以慰藉。他还相当详尽地谈到自以为得了什么病。他说，这是种先天性的疾病，是家族遗传，他已经绝望了，不想再治疗了。他马上又补充一句，这只是神经上的毛病，一准不久就过去了。这种病的症状，从他诸多反常的情绪中可以看得出。他一五一十全地告诉我了。尽管他的措辞和叙述方式或许很有分量，但有些话我听了后，还是既感兴趣，又觉迷惑。神经过敏把他折磨得不轻。只吃得下寡淡无味的饭菜；只能穿某种质地的料子做的衣服；所有鲜花的香味都难以忍受；即便是微弱的光线，也会刺痛眼睛；惟有特殊的声音——弦乐，才不至于使他惊骇。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the manner of my friend I was at once struck with an incoherence -- an inconsistency; and I soon found this to arise from a series of feeble and futile struggles to overcome an habitual trepidancy -- an excessive nervous agitation. For something of this nature I had indeed been prepared, no less by his letter, than by reminiscences of certain boyish traits, and by conclusions deduced from his peculiar physical conformation and temperament. His action was alternately vivacious and sullen. His voice varied rapidly from a tremulous indecision (when the animal spirits seemed utterly in abeyance) to that species of energetic concision -- that abrupt, weighty, unhurried, and hollow-sounding enunciation -- that leaden, self-balanced and perfectly modulated guttural utterance, which may be observed in the lost drunkard, or the irreclaimable eater of opium, during the periods of his most intense excitement.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我一开始就觉出了朋友的一举一动既不连贯，也不协调。很快我就发现，原来他的神经极度紧张——他有着习惯性痉挛，他总想竭力克服这一点，却终是虚弱不堪，白费力气。其实，对他这一特质我早就有思想准备：一是因为我看了他的信；二呢，我还记得他少年时代的某些脾性；其次，从他独特的身体状况和精神气质上，也可以做出推断。他忽而精神高昂，忽而落落寡欢；他的声音上一刻还优柔寡断，抖抖颤颤（此时听来全无生气），下一刻马上就变得干脆有力。那生硬、滞重、空洞、不疾不徐的吐字，沉闷、镇定、运用自如的发音，只能在沉湎酒香的醉汉或不可救药的烟鬼口中听到。他们受了烟酒的剧烈刺激后，就是这么说话的。">查看中文翻译</div>

He was enchained by certain superstitious impressions in regard to the dwelling which he tenanted, and whence, for many years, he had never ventured forth -- in regard to an influence whose supposititious force was conveyed in terms too shadowy here to be re-stated -- an influence which some peculiarities in the mere form and substance of his family mansion, had, by dint of long sufferance, he said, obtained over his spirit -- an effect which the physique of the grey walls and turrets, and of the dim tarn into which they all looked down, had, at length, brought about upon the morale of his existence.</div>

"Her decease," he said, with a bitterness which I can never forget, "would leave him (him the hopeless and the frail) the last of the ancient race of the Ushers." While he spoke, the lady Madeline (for so was she called) passed slowly through a remote portion of the apartment, and, without having noticed my presence, disappeared. I regarded her with an utter astonishment not unmingled with dread -- and yet I found it impossible to account for such feelings. A sensation of stupor oppressed me, as my eyes followed her retreating steps. When a door, at length, closed upon her, my glance sought instinctively and eagerly the countenance of the brother -- but he had buried his face in his hands, and I could only perceive that a far more than ordinary wanness had overspread the emaciated fingers through which trickled many passionate tears.</div>

We painted and read together; or I listened, as if in a dream, to the wild improvisations of his speaking guitar. And thus, as a closer and still closer intimacy admitted me more unreservedly into the recesses of his spirit, the more bitterly did I perceive the futility of all attempt at cheering a mind from which darkness, as if an inherent positive quality, poured forth upon all objects of the moral and physical universe, in one unceasing radiation of gloom.</div>

A settled apathy, a gradual wasting away of the person, and frequent although transient affections of a partially cataleptical character, were the unusual diagnosis.

<div class="line_en">I shall ever bear about me a memory of the many solemn hours I thus spent alone with the master of the House of Usher. Yet I should fail in any attempt to convey an idea of the exact character of the studies, or of the occupations, in which he involved me, or led me the way. An excited and highly distempered ideality threw a sulphureous (sulphurous) lustre over all. His long improvised dirges will ring forever in my ears. Among other things, I hold painfully in mind a certain singular perversion and amplification of the wild air of the last waltz of Von Weber. From the paintings over which his elaborate fancy brooded, and which grew, touch by touch, into vaguenesses at which I shuddered the more thrillingly, because I shuddered knowing not why; -- from these paintings (vivid as their images now are before me) I would in vain endeavour to educe more than a small portion which should lie within the compass of merely written words. By the utter simplicity, by the nakedness of his designs, he arrested and overawed attention. If ever mortal painted an idea, that mortal was Roderick Usher. For me at least -- in the circumstances then surrounding me -- there arose out of the pure abstractions which the hypochondriac contrived to throw upon his canvass, an intensity of intolerable awe, no shadow of which felt I ever yet in the contemplation of the certainly glowing yet too concrete reveries of Fuseli.</div>

<div class="line_en">One of the phantasmagoric conceptions of my friend, partaking not so rigidly of the spirit of abstraction, may be shadowed forth, although feebly, in words. A small picture presented the interior of an immensely long and rectangular vault or tunnel, with low walls, smooth, white, and without interruption or device. Certain accessory points of the design served well to convey the idea that this excavation lay at an exceeding depth below the surface of the earth. No outlet was observed in any portion of its vast extent, and no torch, or other artificial source of light was discernible; yet a flood of intense rays rolled throughout, and bathed the whole in a ghastly and inappropriate splendor.</div>

<div class="line_en">I have just spoken of that morbid condition of the auditory nerve which rendered all music intolerable to the sufferer, with the exception of certain effects of stringed instruments. It was, perhaps, the narrow limits to which he thus confined himself upon the guitar, which gave birth, in great measure, to the fantastic character of his performances. But the fervid facility of his impromptus could not be so accounted for. They must have been, and were, in the notes, as well as in the words of his wild fantasias (for he not unfrequently accompanied himself with rhymed verbal improvisations), the result of that intense mental collectedness and concentration to which I have previously alluded as observable only in particular moments of the highest artificial excitement. The words of one of these rhapsodies I have easily remembered. I was, perhaps, the more forcibly impressed with it, as he gave it, because, in the under or mystic current of its meaning, I fancied that I perceived, and for the first time, a full consciousness on the part of Usher, of the tottering of his lofty reason upon her throne. The verses, which were entitled "The Haunted Palace," ran very nearly, if not accurately, thus:</div>

<div class="line_en">I well remember that suggestions arising from this ballad, led us into a train of thought wherein there became manifest an opinion of Usher's which I mention not so much on account of its novelty, (for other men* have thought thus), as on account of the pertinacity with which he maintained it. This opinion, in its general form, was that of the sentience of all vegetable things. But, in his disordered fancy, the idea had assumed a more daring character, and trespassed, under certain conditions, upon the kingdom of inorganization. I lack words to express the full extent, or the earnest abandon of his persuasion. The belief, however, was connected (as I have previously hinted) with the grey stones of the home of his forefathers. The conditions of the sentience had been here, he imagined, fulfilled in the method of collocation of these stones -- in the order of their arrangement, as well as in that of the many fungi which overspread them, and of the decayed trees which stood around -- above all, in the long undisturbed endurance of this arrangement, and in its reduplication in the still waters of the tarn. Its evidence -- the evidence of the sentience -- was to be seen, he said, (and I here started as he spoke), in the gradual yet certain condensation of an atmosphere of their own about the waters and the walls. The result was discoverable, he added, in that silent, yet importunate and terrible influence which for centuries had moulded the destinies of his family, and which made him what I now saw him -- what he was. Such opinions need no comment, and I will make none.</div>

<div class="line_en">I could not help thinking of the wild ritual of this work, and of its probable influence upon the hypochondriac, when, one evening, having informed me abruptly that the lady Madeline was no more, he stated his intention of preserving her corpse for a fortnight, (previously to its final interment), in one of the numerous vaults within the main walls of the building. The worldly reason, however, assigned for this singular proceeding, was one which I did not feel at liberty to dispute. The brother had been led to his resolution (so he told me) by consideration of the unusual character of the malady of the deceased, of certain obtrusive and eager inquiries on the part of her medical men, and of the remote and exposed situation of the burial-ground of the family. I will not deny that when I called to mind the sinister countenance of the person whom I met upon the staircase, on the day of my arrival at the house, I had no desire to oppose what I regarded as at best but a harmless, and by no means an unnatural, precaution.</div>

One favourite volume was a small octavo edition of the Directorium Inquisitorium (Inquisitorum), by the Dominican Eymeric de Gironne; and there were passages in Pomponius Mela, about the old African Satyrs and œgipans, over which Usher would sit dreaming for hours.

<div class="line_en">At the request of Usher, I personally aided him in the arrangements for the temporary entombment. The body having been encoffined, we two alone bore it to its rest. The vault in which we placed it (and which had been so long unopened that our torches, half smothered in its oppressive atmosphere, gave us little opportunity for investigation) was small, damp, and entirely without means of admission for light; lying, at great depth, immediately beneath that portion of the building in which was my own sleeping apartment. It had been used, apparently, in remote feudal times, for the worst purposes of a donjon-keep, and, in later days, as a place of deposit for powder, or some other highly combustible substance, as a portion of its floor, and the whole interior of a long archway through which we reached it, were carefully sheathed with copper. The door, of massive iron, had been, also, similarly protected. Its immense weight caused an unusually sharp grating sound, as it moved upon its hinges.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="应厄榭之请，我亲自帮他料理临时的殡殓事务。尸体已入棺，我们两个抬着送往安放它的地窖。地窖已多年不曾打开过，空气令人窒息，差点儿把火把扑灭。我们没能仔细看上一看。只觉它又狭小又潮湿，透不进一丝微光。它在很深的地下，上面恰好就是我的卧室所在地。显而易见，在遥远的封建时代，地窖派的是最坏的用场——它是作为死牢存在的；近年来，则当库房使了，存放火药或其他极为易燃的物品，因为一部分地板和通向外面的那条长长拱廊的四壁，都仔仔细细包着黄铜。那扇厚重的铁门，也一样包着黄铜。在开合之际，沉重铁门上的铰链发出分外尖锐的嘎吱嘎吱声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Having deposited our mournful burden upon tressels within this region of horror, we partially turned aside the yet unscrewed lid of the coffin, and looked upon the face of the tenant. A striking similitude between the brother and sister now first arrested my attention; and Usher, divining, perhaps, my thoughts, murmured out some few words from which I learned that the deceased and himself had been twins, and that sympathies of a scarcely intelligible nature had always existed between them. Our glances, however, rested not long upon the dead -- for we could not regard her unawed. The disease which had thus entombed the lady in the maturity of youth, had left, as usual in all maladies of a strictly cataleptical character, the mockery of a faint blush upon the bosom and the face, and that suspiciously lingering smile upon the lip which is so terrible in death. We replaced and screwed down the lid, and, having secured the door of iron, made our way, with toil, into the scarcely less gloomy apartments of the upper portion of the house.</div>

<div class="line_en">And now, some days of bitter grief having elapsed, an observable change came over the features of the mental disorder of my friend. His ordinary manner had vanished. His ordinary occupations were neglected or forgotten. He roamed from chamber to chamber with hurried, unequal, and objectless step. The pallor of his countenance had assumed, if possible, a more ghastly hue -- but the luminousness of his eye had utterly gone out. The once occasional huskiness of his tone was heard no more; and a tremulous quaver, as if of extreme terror, habitually characterized his utterance. There were times, indeed, when I thought his unceasingly agitated mind was labouring with some oppressive secret, to divulge which he struggled for the necessary courage. At times, again, I was obliged to resolve all into the mere inexplicable vagaries of madness, for I beheld him gazing upon vacancy for long hours, in an attitude of the profoundest attention, as if listening to some imaginary sound. It was no wonder that his condition terrified -- that it infected me. I felt creeping upon me, by slow yet certain degrees, the wild influences of his own fantastic yet impressive superstitions.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was, especially, upon retiring to bed late in the night of the seventh or eighth day after the placing of the lady Madeline within the donjon, that I experienced the full power of such feelings. Sleep came not near my couch -- while the hours waned and waned away. I struggled to reason off the nervousness which had dominion over me. I endeavoured to believe that much, if not all of what I felt, was due to the bewildering influence of the gloomy furniture of the room -- of the dark and tattered draperies, which, tortured into motion by the breath of a rising tempest, swayed fitfully to and fro upon the walls, and rustled uneasily about the decorations of the bed. But my efforts were fruitless. An irrepressible tremor gradually pervaded my frame; and, at length, there sat upon my very heart an incubus of utterly causeless alarm. Shaking this off with a gasp and a struggle, I uplifted myself upon the pillows, and, peering earnestly within the intense darkness of the chamber, harkened -- I know not why, except that an instinctive spirit prompted me -- to certain low and indefinite sounds which came, through the pauses of the storm, at long intervals, I knew not whence. Overpowered by an intense sentiment of horror, unaccountable yet unendurable, I threw on my clothes with haste (for I felt that I should sleep no more during the night), and endeavoured to arouse myself from the pitiable condition into which I had fallen, by pacing rapidly to and fro through the apartment.</div>

<div class="line_en">I had taken but few turns in this manner, when a light step on an adjoining staircase arrested my attention. I presently recognised it as that of Usher. In an instant afterward he rapped, with a gentle touch, at my door, and entered, bearing a lamp. His countenance was, as usual, cadaverously wan -- but, moreover, there was a species of mad hilarity in his eyes -- an evidently restrained hysteria in his whole demeanour. His air appalled me -- but anything was preferable to the solitude which I had so long endured, and I even welcomed his presence as a relief.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我刚来回转上几圈，就听得附近楼梯上传来一阵轻微的脚步声。我的耳朵竖起来了。不久听出了是厄榭的脚步。转瞬间，他轻轻叩了叩房门，走了进来。手里，掌着一盏灯。他的面色照常是死尸般苍白，不过眼睛里却流溢出狂喜。他的举止中，显然带有压抑着的歇斯底里。他的模样让我惊骇。我一切都能忍受，因为长夜的孤独，是那么不堪。我甚至是欢迎他来这里。我把他的到来当成了一种安慰。">查看中文翻译</div>

Thus speaking, and having carefully shaded his lamp, he hurried to one of the casements, and threw it freely open to the storm.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你没看到么？”他无言地朝四周盯视片刻，突然说，“难道你那会子没看见？且慢！你会看到的。”这么说着，他谨慎地把灯遮好，快速走到一扇窗子前，猛地打开了它。窗外，雨狂风急。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The impetuous fury of the entering gust nearly lifted us from our feet. It was, indeed, a tempestuous yet sternly beautiful night, and one wildly singular in its terror and its beauty. A whirlwind had apparently collected its force in our vicinity; for there were frequent and violent alterations in the direction of the wind; and the exceeding density of the clouds (which hung so low as to press upon the turrets of the house) did not prevent our perceiving the life-like velocity with which they flew careering from all points against each other, without passing away into the distance. I say that even their exceeding density did not prevent our perceiving this -- yet we had no glimpse of the moon or stars -- nor was there any flashing forth of the lightning. But the under surfaces of the huge masses of agitated vapour, as well as all terrestrial objects immediately around us, were glowing in the unnatural light of a faintly luminous and distinctly visible gaseous exhalation which hung about and enshrouded the mansion.</div>

<div class="line_en">The antique volume which I had taken up was the "Mad Trist" of Sir Launcelot Canning; but I had called it a favourite of Usher's more in sad jest than in earnest; for, in truth, there is little in its uncouth and unimaginative prolixity which could have had interest for the lofty and spiritual ideality of my friend. It was, however, the only book immediately at hand; and I indulged a vague hope that the excitement which now agitated the hypochondriac, might find relief (for the history of mental disorder is full of similar anomalies) even in the extremeness of the folly which I should read. Could I have judged, indeed, by the wild overstrained air of vivacity with which he harkened, or apparently harkened, to the words of the tale, I might well have congratulated myself upon the success of my design.</div>

<div class="line_en">I had arrived at that well-known portion of the story where Ethelred, the hero of the Trist, having sought in vain for peaceable admission into the dwelling of the hermit, proceeds to make good an entrance by force. Here, it will be remembered, the words of the narrative run thus:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我已念到很有名的那段了，故事的主人公埃塞尔雷德殚精竭虑想和平进入隐士的居所，却终是徒然，于是他付诸武力，强行闯了进去。记得这段情节是这么写的：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At the termination of this sentence I started, and for a moment, paused; for it appeared to me (although I at once concluded that my excited fancy had deceived me) -- it appeared to me that, from some very remote portion of the mansion, there came, indistinctly, to my ears, what might have been, in its exact similarity of character, the echo (but a stifled and dull one certainly) of the very cracking and ripping sound which Sir Launcelot had so particularly described. It was, beyond doubt, the coincidence alone which had arrested my attention; for, amid the rattling of the sashes of the casements, and the ordinary commingled noises of the still increasing storm, the sound, in itself, had nothing, surely, which should have interested or disturbed me. I continued the story:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="念完这话，我吃了一惊。有一会子，我没再念下去。因为我仿佛听到——虽然立刻就断定是由于激动，生了幻想，属一时错觉——我仿佛听到从府邸的一角远远传来模糊的回声，与兰斯劳特爵士特别描述的劈啪的破裂声几乎一模一样，当然较之沉闷压抑了些。毋庸置疑，正是这种巧合，吸引了我的注意力。但有了窗子的“啪嗒啪嗒”声，以及照旧混合着嘈杂之音的仍在加剧的风暴声，这个声音确实不算什么，它既不能勾起我的兴趣，也不会搅扰得我心慌意乱。我接着念道：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"And Ethelred, who was by nature of a doughty heart, and who was now mighty withal, on account of the powerfulness of the wine which he had drunken, waited no longer to hold parley with the hermit, who, in sooth, was of an obstinate and maliceful turn, but, feeling the rain upon his shoulders, and fearing the rising of the tempest, uplifted his mace outright, and, with blows, made quickly room in the plankings of the door for his gauntleted hand; and now pulling therewith sturdily, he so cracked, and ripped, and tore all asunder, that the noise of the dry and hollow-sounding wood alarummed and reverberated throughout the forest."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“埃塞尔雷德生性勇猛刚强，加之刚灌过几杯，趁着酒力，就不再与隐士多费唇舌。那隐士也天性固执，心狠手辣。埃塞尔雷德感觉肩膀上落了雨点，惟恐暴风雨来临，立刻抡起钉锤，照着大门砸了几下，厚厚的门板很快就被砸出一个窟窿。他把套着臂铠的手伸进去，使劲一拉，“噼啪”一声，门被撕裂，接着扯得粉碎。干燥空洞的木板碎裂声，在整个森林里回荡着，令人心慌。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Oppressed, as I certainly was, upon the occurrence of this second and most extraordinary coincidence, by a thousand conflicting sensations, in which wonder and extreme terror were predominant, I still retained sufficient presence of mind to avoid exciting, by any observation, the sensitive nervousness of my companion. I was by no means certain that he had noticed the sounds in question; although, assuredly, a strange alteration had, during the last few minutes, taken place in his demeanour. From a position fronting my own, he had gradually brought round his chair, so as to sit with his face to the door of the chamber; and thus I could but partially perceive his features, although I saw that his lips trembled as if he were murmuring inaudibly. His head had dropped upon his breast -- yet I knew that he was not asleep, from the wide and rigid opening of the eye as I caught a glance of it in profile. The motion of his body, too, was at variance with this idea -- for he rocked from side to side with a gentle yet constant and uniform sway. Having rapidly taken notice of all this, I resumed the narrative of Sir Launcelot, which thus proceeded:</div>

Completely unnerved, I leaped to my feet; but the measured rocking movement of Usher was undisturbed. I rushed to the chair in which he sat. His eyes were bent fixedly before him, and throughout his whole countenance there reigned a stony rigidity. But, as I placed my hand upon his shoulder, there came a strong shudder over his whole person; a sickly smile quivered about his lips; and I saw that he spoke in a low, hurried, and gibbering murmur, as if unconscious of my presence. Bending closely over him, I at length drank in the hideous import of his words.</div>

It was the work of the rushing gust -- but then without those doors there did stand the lofty and enshrouded figure of the lady Madeline of Usher. There was blood upon her white robes, and the evidence of some bitter struggle upon every portion of her emaciated frame.

Suddenly there shot along the path a wild light, and I turned to see whence a gleam so unusual could have issued; for the vast house and its shadows were alone behind me. The radiance was that of the full, setting, and blood-red moon, which now shone vividly through that once barely-discernible fissure, of which I have before spoken as extending from the roof of the building, in a zigzag direction, to the base. While I gazed, this fissure rapidly widened -- there came a fierce breath of the whirlwind -- the entire orb of the satellite burst at once upon my sight -- my brain reeled as I saw the mighty walls rushing asunder -- there was a long tumultuous shouting sound like the voice of a thousand waters -- and the deep and dank tarn at my feet closed sullenly and silently over the fragments of the "House of Usher."</div>
