<div class="line_en">He was sick when they first brought him here. The cough that had plagued him since the battle grew worse, and a fever took hold of him as well. His lips broke with blood blisters, and the warmth of the cell did not stop his shivering. I will not linger long, he remembered thinking. I will die soon, here in the dark.</div>

<div class="line_en">But Davos could not complain of chill. The smooth stony passages beneath the great mass of Dragonstone were always warm, and Davos had often heard it said they grew warmer the farther down one went. He was well below the castle, he judged, and the wall of his cell often felt warm to his touch when he pressed a palm against it. Perhaps the old tales were true, and Dragonstone was built with the stones of hell.</div>

<div class="line_en">The cell was warmer than any cell had a right to be. It was dark, yes. Flickering orange light fell through the ancient iron bars from the torch in the sconce on the wall outside, but the back half of the cell remained drenched in gloom. It was dank as well, as might be expected on an isle such as Dragonstone, where the sea was never far. And there were rats, as many as any dungeon could expect to have and a few more besides.</div>

<div class="line_en">Davos soon found that he was wrong about that, as about so much else. Dimly he remembered gentle hands and a firm voice, and young Maester Pylos looking down on him. He was given hot garlic broth to drink, and milk of the poppy to take away his aches and shivers. The poppy made him sleep and while he slept they leeched him to drain off the bad blood. Or so he surmised, by the leech marks on his arms when he woke. Before very long the coughing stopped, the blisters vanished, and his broth had chunks of whitefish in it, and carrots and onions as well. And one day he realized that he felt stronger than he had since Black Betha shattered beneath him and flung him in the river.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不久，戴佛斯发现，跟其他许多事情一样，这次他又想错了。他依稀记得一手轻柔的手和一副坚定的嗓音，年轻的派洛斯学士俯视着他，喂他温热的大蒜汤和罂粟花奶，以消除疼痛与颤栗。罂粟让他沉睡，这期间，他们用水蛭给他放血，吸掉毒素——或者说根据醒来时手臂上的咬痕，他这么猜测。之后，咳嗽停止，血泡消失，他们提供鱼肉汤，里面还有胡萝卜和洋葱。终有一天，他意识到自己比当初黑贝莎号在脚下爆炸，并将他抛进长河时更为强壮。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He had two gaolers to tend him. One was broad and squat, with thick shoulders and huge strong hands. He wore a leather brigantine dotted with iron studs, and once a day brought Davos a bowl of oaten porridge. Sometimes he sweetened it with honey or poured in a bit of milk. The other gaoler was older, stooped and sallow, with greasy unwashed hair and pebbled skin. He wore a doublet of white velvet with a ring of stars worked upon the breast in golden thread. It fit him badly, being both too short and too loose, and was soiled and torn besides. He would bring Davos plates of meat and mash, or fish stew, and once even half a lamprey pie. The lamprey was so rich he could not keep it down, but even so, it was a rare treat for a prisoner in a dungeon.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着，他被交给两名看守。一个又矮又壮，有宽阔的肩膀和强健的巨掌。他穿镶钉皮甲，每天给戴佛斯带来一碗燕麦粥，有时候会往里面掺一些蜂蜜或牛奶。另一个看守年纪较大，弯腰驼背，脸色发黄，长着油腻肮脏的头发和粗糙的皮肤。他穿一件白天鹅绒上衣，胸前用金线锈了一圈星星，但衣服很不合身，显得又短又宽，而且肮脏破旧。他会给戴佛斯带来一盘肉末或炖鱼，有回甚至拿来半份鳗鱼派。鳗鱼太腻，难以下咽，即便如此，这已是黑牢囚犯鲜有的待遇。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Neither sun nor moon shone in the dungeons; no windows pierced the thick stone walls. The only way to tell day from night was by his gaolers. Neither man would speak to him, though he knew they were no mutes; sometimes he heard them exchange a few brusque words as the watch was changing. They would not even tell him their names, so he gave them names of his own. The short strong one he called Porridge, the stooped sallow one Lamprey, for the pie. He marked the passage of days by the meals they brought, and by the changing of the torches in the sconce outside his cell.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="黑牢厚厚的石墙上没有窗户，自然毫无日月之光，只能根据看守换班来分辨昼夜更替。他俩都不跟他说话，但他知道他们不是哑巴，有时候，他听见换班时看守会粗率地交谈几句。他们甚至连名字也不告诉他，他只好替他们取外号，又矮又壮就叫“麦片粥”，而那驼背黄脸的叫“鳗鱼”——因为那半份鳗鱼派的关系。根据一日送来的两餐，根据牢房外壁台上火炬的更换，他简单地推断着日期。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A man grows lonely in the dark, and hungers for the sound of a human voice. Davos would talk to the gaolers whenever they came to his cell, whether to bring him food or change his slops pail. He knew they would be deaf to pleas for freedom or mercy; instead he asked them questions, hoping perhaps one day one might answer. "What news of the war?" he asked, and "Is the king well?" He asked after his son Devan, and the Princess Shireen, and Salladhor Saan. "What is the weather like?" he asked, and "Have the autumn storms begun yet? Do ships still sail the narrow sea?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在黑暗中，人会变得寂寞，渴望听见声音。因此每当看守们来到戴佛斯的牢房，不管送食物还是换便桶，他都试图跟他们讲话。他知道，申辩或恳求都不会有人理睬，因此他问问题，期望某天某位看守会开口。“战争有何进展？”他问，“国王还好吗？”除此之外，他还询问自己的儿子戴文，询问希琳公主，询问萨拉多·桑恩。“天气怎么样？”他问，“秋季风暴开始了吗？狭海上仍有船只航行吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It made no matter what he asked; they never answered, though sometimes Porridge gave him a look, and for half a heartbeat Davos would think that he was about to speak. With Lamprey there was not even that much. I am not a man to him, Davos thought, only a stone that eats and shits and speaks. He decided after a while that he liked Porridge much the better. Porridge at least seemed to know he was alive, and there was a queer sort of kindness to the man. Davos suspected that he fed the rats; that was why there were so many. Once he thought he heard the gaoler talking to them as if they were children, but perhaps he'd only dreamed that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不管问什么，结果都一样，他们从不回答，尽管有时候“麦片粥”会看他一眼，让戴佛斯产生些许希望。“鳗鱼”则连这点也没有。在他眼中，我不是人，戴佛斯心想，只是一块会吃饭会说话会拉屎的石头。他觉得自己比较喜欢“麦片粥”，他至少还当他是个人，而且怀有一种古怪的仁慈。戴佛斯怀疑这满黑牢的老鼠正是他喂的。有一次，他听见那看守在跟老鼠讲话，仿佛当它们是孩子，又或许这只是又一个梦罢。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They do not mean to let me die, he realized. They are keeping me alive, for some purpose of their own. He did not like to think what that might be. Lord Sunglass had been confined in the cells beneath Dragonstone for a time, as had Ser Hubard Rambton's sons; all of them had ended on the pyre. I should have given myself to the sea, Davos thought as he sat staring at the torch beyond the bars. Or let the sail pass me by, to perish on my rock. I would sooner feed crabs than flames.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们不要我死，他意识到，为某种目的，他们要我活下去。他不愿去想那是什么目的。桑格拉斯伯爵曾被关在龙石岛下的黑牢里，连同赫柏·蓝布顿的两个儿子——但他们最终都被活活烧死。我早该将自己交付给大海，戴佛斯边想，边凝视着栏杆外面的火炬，我早该任凭那艘船过去，死于礁石之上。喂螃蟹也好过葬身火焰。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"The war," she affirmed. "There are two, Onion Knight. Not seven, not one, not a hundred or a thousand. Two! Do you think I crossed half the world to put yet another vain king on yet another empty throne? The war has been waged since time began, and before it is done, all men must choose where they will stand. On one side is R'hllor, the Lord of Light, the Heart of Fire, the God of Flame and Shadow. Against him stands the Great Other whose name may not be spoken, the Lord of Darkness, the Soul of Ice, the God of Night and Terror. Ours is not a choice between Baratheon and Lannister, between Greyjoy and Stark. It is death we choose, or life. Darkness, or light." She clasped the bars of his cell with her slender white hands. The great ruby at her throat seemed to pulse with its own radiance. "So tell me, Ser Davos Seaworth, and tell me truly -- does your heart burn with the shining light of R'hllor? Or is it black and cold and full of worms?" She reached through the bars and laid three fingers upon his breast, as if to feel the truth of him through flesh and wool and leather.</div>

You are both wrong. He is the Lord's chosen, the warrior of fire. I have seen him leading the fight against the dark, I have seen it in the flames. The flames do not lie, else you would not be here.

<div class="line_en">With a smile and swirl of scarlet skirts, she was gone. Only her scent lingered after. That, and the torch. Davos lowered himself to the floor of the cell and wrapped his arms about his knees. The shifting torchlight washed over him. Once Melisandre's footsteps faded away, the only sound was the scrabbling of rats. Ice and fire, he thought. Black and white. Dark and light. Davos could not deny the power of her god. He had seen the shadow crawling from Melisandre's womb, and the priestess knew things she had no way of knowing. She saw my purpose in her flames. it was good to learn that Salla had not sold him, but the thought of the red woman spying out his secrets with her fires disquieted him more than he could say. And what did she mean when she said that I had served her god and would serve him again? He did not like that either.</div>

<div class="line_en">Three days later -- well, Porridge had come thrice, and Lamprey twice -- Davos heard voices outside his cell. He sat up at once, his back to the stone wall, listening to the sounds of struggle. This was new, a change in his unchanging world. The noise was coming from the left, where the steps led up to daylight. He could hear a man's voice, pleading and shouting.</div>

I vowed to do the same, for the return of Brightwater Keep and all our lands. I thought… Lord Tywin would see the sense in my proposal. He still has the Starks to deal with, and the ironmen as well.
