<div class="line_en">All through January, he managed to hold himself together, but by early February, Max was in worrisome shape.

<div class="line_en">Unfortunately, that night signaled a severe downslide in Max's health. The early signs were innocent enough, and typical. Constant coldness. Swimming hands. Increased visions of boxing with the Fuhrer. It was only when he couldn't warm up after his push-ups and sit-ups that it truly began to worry him. As close to the fire as he sat, he could not raise himself to any degree of approximate health. Day by day, his weight began to stumble off him. His exercise regimen faltered and fell apart, with his cheek against the surly basement floor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不幸的是，那天晚上，马克斯的健康状况急转直下。早期的迹象并不惹人注意，只是挥之不去的寒意，不停出汗的双手。与元首的拳击赛越来越频繁地浮现在他眼前。当他再也无法用俯卧撑和仰卧起坐温暖身子时，他终于开始担心自己的情况了。虽然坐在炉火边，马克斯却觉察不到丝毫健康的感觉。他日渐消瘦，锻炼也难以为继，他扑倒在地，脸颊贴在地下室阴冷的地上。">查看中文翻译</div>
