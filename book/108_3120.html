<div class="line_en">Ove has brought along a blue plastic deck chair to push into the snow and sit on. This could take a while, he knows. It always does when he has to tell Sonja something she doesn't like. He carefully brushes away all the snow from the gravestone, so they can see each other properly.</div>

<div class="line_en">In just short of forty years a lot of different kinds of people have had time to pass through their block of row houses. The house between Ove's and Rune's has been lived in by quiet, loud, peculiar, unbearable, and hardly noticeable kinds of people. Families have lived there whose teenage children pissed on the fence when they were drunk, or families who tried to plant nonapproved bushes in the garden, and families who got the idea that they wanted to paint their house pink. And if there was one single thing Ove and Rune agreed on, irrespective of how much they were feuding at the time, it was that whoever currently populated the neighbor's house tended to be utter imbeciles.</div>

<div class="line_en">At the end of the 1980s the house was bought by a man who was apparently some sort of bank manager -- as "an investment," Ove heard him boast to the real estate agent. He, in turn, rented the house to a series of tenants in the coming years. One summer, to three young men who made an audacious attempt to redefine it as a free zone for a veritable parade of drug addicts, prostitutes, and criminal elements. The parties went on around the clock, broken glass from beer bottles covered the little walkway between the houses like confetti, and the music boomed out so loud that the pictures fell off the wall in Sonja and Ove's living room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="八十年代末买这套房子的人显然是个银行家，因为欧维听见他跟房产销售解释什么“投资项目”。之后他就把房子出租给不同的房客。一年夏天，租房的三个年轻人无畏地想把房子改造成避难所，收容那些瘾君子、皮条客和在逃犯。狂欢昼夜不息，啤酒瓶的玻璃碎片礼花般撒满房子之间的小道，音乐轰鸣，震得欧维和索雅家客厅墙壁上的涂料纷纷坠落。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ove went over to put a stop to the nuisance, and the young men jeered at him. When he refused to go, one of them threatened him with a knife. When Sonja tried to make them see sense the following day, they called her a "paralyzed old bag." The evening after they played louder than ever, and when Anita in pure desperation stood outside and shouted at them, they threw a bottle that went right through her and Rune's living room window.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维想去阻止他们继续胡作非为，但年轻人对他百般羞辱。当他拒绝离开时，其中一个还拔刀威胁他。第二天索雅想跟他们讲道理，他们辱骂她是“残废婊”。当天晚上，他们播放音乐的声音比以往更大，安妮塔绝望地站在自己的院子里冲他们叫嚷的时候，他们往她和鲁尼家的窗户里扔了个酒瓶子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ove immediately began working on his plans for revenge by examining the financial doings of their landlord. He called lawyers and the tax authorities to put a stop to the renting of the house, and he intended to persist with it even if he had to take the case "all the bloody way to the Supreme Court," as he put it to Sonja. But he never had time to get that idea off the ground.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维立刻着手计划通过调查他们房东的经济黑幕进行报复。他给律师和税务部门打电话，想要终止出租合同，若有必要，他会“把这案子一直告到最高法院”，他对索雅这么说。这主意却从未来得及落实。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Late one night he saw Rune walking towards the parking area with his car keys in his hand. When he came back he had a plastic bag, the contents of which Ove could not determine, in his hand.

<div class="line_en">One summer halfway through the 1990s, a woman moved in with a chubby boy of about nine, whom Sonja and Anita immediately took to their hearts. The boy's father had left them when the boy was newborn, Sonja and Anita were told. A bull-necked man of about forty who lived with them now, and whose breath the two women tried to ignore for as long as possible, was her new love. He was rarely at home, and Anita and Sonja avoided asking too many questions. They supposed that the girl saw qualities in him that they, perhaps, did not understand. "He has taken care of us, and you know how it is, it's not easy being a single mother," she said with a brave smile at some point, and the women from the neighboring houses left it at that.</div>

<div class="line_en">When the bull-necked man was away the next time, Sonja invited in the woman and the boy for coffee. The woman explained with a strained laugh that the bruises were because she had thrown open a kitchen cabinet too quickly. In the evening Rune met the bull-necked man in the parking area. He got out of his car in a clear state of intoxication.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="牛脖子再次离家的时候，索雅请女人和男孩来家里喝咖啡。女人谨慎地笑着解释，说瘀青是她把橱门开得太快造成的。傍晚，鲁尼在停车场遇见牛脖子，他摇摇晃晃下车，显然喝醉了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the two nights that followed, the neighboring houses on either side overheard how the man was shouting in there and things were being thrown on the floor. They heard the woman giving a short cry of pain, and when the sound of the weeping nine-year-old boy pleading with the man to stop came through the wall, Ove went outside and stood in front of his house. Rune was already waiting.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="之后连续两个夜晚，两边的邻居分别从自己的客厅里听见男人的咆哮和地板上的撞击声。他们听见女人痛苦地发出一声短促的哀号，当九岁男孩哭喊着求那个男人“别打了别打了别打了”，欧维再也按捺不住，出门冲到自己的院子里。鲁尼已经站在院子那边了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They were in the midst of one of their worst-ever power struggles in the steering group of the Residents' Association. Had not even spoken to each other for almost a year. Now they just briefly glanced at one another, and then went back into their houses without a word. Two minutes later they met fully dressed at the front. They rang the bell; the thug lashed out at them as soon as he opened the door, but Ove's fist struck the bridge of his nose. The man lost his footing, got up, grabbed a kitchen knife, and ran at Ove. He never got there. Rune's massive fist slugged him like a mallet. In his heyday he was quite a piece, that Rune. Highly unwise to get involved in fisticuffs with him.</div>

<div class="line_en">The next day the man left the house and never came back. The young woman slept with Anita and Rune for two weeks before she dared go home again with her boy. Then Rune and Ove went into town and went to the bank, and in the evening Sonja and Anita explained to the young woman that she could see it as a gift or a loan, whichever she preferred.

<div class="line_en">In the morning, Ove had called that Social Services Authority or whatever the hell it was called. He'd called from Parvaneh's house because he no longer had a telephone line. Parvaneh had advised him to be "friendly and approachable." It hadn't started so well, because before long Ove had been connected to the "responsible officer." Which was the smoking man in the white shirt. He directly demonstrated a significant level of agitation about the little white Škoda, which was still parked at the end of the road outside Rune and Anita's house. And, yes, Ove could have established a better negotiating position if he'd immediately apologized about it and maybe even agreed that it was regrettable that he'd intentionally put the man in the white shirt in this nonvehicular predicament. It would certainly have been better than the alternative, which was to hiss: "So maybe you've learned to read signs now! Illiterate bastard!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="上午欧维给那个叫社会保障部还是什么的部门打了个电话。他是从帕尔瓦娜家打的，而他自己的电话号码已经注销了。事先帕尔瓦娜叮嘱过他一定要亲切友好。但开头不太顺利，因为很快接线员就把欧维转给了负责人。就是那个抽烟的白衬衫。他直接表示，那辆白色小斯柯达仍停在街尽头的安妮塔和鲁尼家门口这件事，让人非常愤慨。如果欧维立刻就此道歉，甚至承认让他身处这般困境完全没有必要，他从中斡旋的余地可能还更大一些。可以这么说，至少肯定比他对那人说“去学学念标牌吧，你个该死的文盲”之后的情况要好。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ove's next move involved trying to convince the man that Rune should not be put in a home. The man informed Ove that "Illiterate bastard!" was a very bad choice of words for bringing up that subject. After this, there was a long series of impolite phrases on both ends of the telephone line, before Ove declared in clear terms that things could not be allowed to work like this. One couldn't just come along and remove people from their homes and transport them to institutions any old way one liked, just because their memory was getting a bit defective. The man at the other end answered coldly that it didn't matter very much where they put Rune now "in the state he was in" because for him it "would probably make a very marginal difference where he was." Ove roared a series of invectives back. And then the man in the white shirt said something very stupid.</div>

<div class="line_en">And so it came to pass that when the chain-smoking man in the white shirt turned up on their road that afternoon accompanied by a police officer to demand that Ove release the white Škoda from its captivity, both the trailer and the white Škoda were already gone. Ove stood outside his house with his hands calmly tucked into his pockets, while his adversary finally lost his composure altogether and started roaring expletives at him. Ove maintained that he had no idea how this had happened, but pointed out in a friendly manner that none of this would have happened in the first place if he'd just respected the sign that made it clear that cars were prohibited in the area.
