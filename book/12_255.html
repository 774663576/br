<div class="line_en">It may indeed have been daytime now, as Gollum said, but the hobbits could see little difference, unless, perhaps, the heavy sky above was less utterly black, more like a great roof of smoke; while instead of the darkness of deep night, which lingered still in cracks and holes, a grey blurring shadow shrouded the stony world about them. They passed on, Gollum in front and the hobbits now side by side, up the long ravine between the piers and columns of torn and weathered rock, standing like huge unshapen statues on either hand. There was no sound. Some way ahead, a mile or so, perhaps, was a great grey wall, a last huge upthrusting mass of mountain-stone. Darker it loomed, and steadily it rose as they approached, until it towered up high above them, shutting out the view of all that lay beyond. Deep shadow lay before its feet.</div>

<div class="line_en">"This is the way in," said Gollum softly. "This is the entrance to the tunnel." He did not speak its name: Torech Ungol, Shelob's Lair. Out of it came a stench, not the sickly odour of decay in the meads of Morgul, but a foul reek, as if filth unnameable were piled and hoarded in the dark within.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这就是进去的地方，”咕鲁柔声说。“这就是隧道的入口。”他并没有说出它的名字：托瑞克昂哥：尸罗的巢穴。从其中传出了一种浓烈的臭味，这并非是魔窟山谷中的腐败迄未，而是一种恶心的恶臭，仿佛有各种各样的难以名状的秽物堆积在洞穴中，在黑暗之中蕴育着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="咕鲁的眼中异光闪动。“他不知道我们介意什么，是吧，宝贝？不，他不明白。但史麦戈可以忍受很多事情。是的，他曾经走过这条路，喔，是的，从中间通过。这是唯一的道路。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Drawing a deep breath they passed inside. In a few steps they were in utter and impenetrable dark. Not since the lightless passages of Moria had Frodo or Sam known such darkness, and if possible here it was deeper and denser. There, there were airs moving, and echoes, and a sense of space. Here the air was still, stagnant, heavy, and sound fell dead. They walked as it were in a black vapour wrought of veritable darkness itself that, as it was breathed, brought blindness not only to the eyes but to the mind, so that even the memory of colours and of forms and of any light faded out of thought. Night always had been, and always would be, and night was all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们在洞口深深吸了一口气之后走了进去。走不了几步，眼前就变得一片漆黑。自从摩瑞亚那黑暗的矿坑信道之后，山姆和佛罗多就没有遇见过这么完全的黑暗了；而且，甚至它还让人觉得更深沉、更浓密。在矿坑内，还有空气流动、回声和广大空间的感觉。这里的空气沉滞、凝重，声音仿佛会被吸收一般。他们似乎走在一个完全由黑暗的本质所构成的恐怖世界当中，这黑暗所吐出的呼吸不只会让人的眼睛看不见，更可以抹去脑中一切关于颜色和形状的记忆。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But for a while they could still feel, and indeed the senses of their feet and fingers at first seemed sharpened almost painfully. The walls felt, to their surprise, smooth, and the floor, save for a step now and again, was straight and even, going ever up at the same stiff slope. The tunnel was high and wide, so wide that, though the hobbits walked abreast, only touching the side-walls with their outstretched hands, they were separated, cut off alone in the darkness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这里是永夜，永不改变的黑夜，这里的一切都是黑夜。不过，在刚开始，他们还可以感觉到四周的不同；事实上，他们四肢的触觉似乎被放大到让人感觉到难过的程度。他们可以确切的感觉到墙壁是光滑的，地板上除了偶有的阶梯之外，是十分平坦的，一直沿着固定的角度往上攀升。这条隧道十分的宽敝，宽到两名哈比人肩并着肩走路的时候只能用指尖碰触到两边的洞壁，他们感觉自己被黑暗和整个世界彻底的分隔开来了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Gollum had gone in first and seemed to be only a few steps ahead. While they were still able to give heed to such things, they could hear his breath hissing and gasping just in front of them. But after a time their senses became duller, both touch and hearing seemed to grow numb, and they kept on, groping, walking, on and on, mainly by the force of the will with which they had entered, will to go through and desire to come at last to the high gate beyond.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="咕鲁先走进去，好象就在几步之外。在他们还有心情他顾的时候，可以听到他的呼吸声就在前面。但是，过不了多久之后，他们的感官变得更加迟钝，触觉和听觉似乎都麻痹了；他们依旧必须摸索着往前进，只靠着当初进来的一股意志力支撑，希望不久之后就可以穿透隧道，来到另一边的洞口。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Before they had gone very far, perhaps, but time and distance soon passed out of his reckoning, Sam on the right, feeling the wall, was aware that there was an opening at the side: for a moment he caught a faint breath of some air less heavy, and then they passed it by.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在他们走了不久之后（这只是个推断，因为时间的流逝和距离似乎都失去了意义），山姆走在右边，触摸着墙壁，可以清楚的感觉到那个方向有一个开口：他嗅到一种比较没有那么沉重的气息，接着又走了过去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After that, first he on the right, and then Frodo on the left, passed three or four such openings, some wider, some smaller; but there was as yet no doubt of the main way, for it was straight, and did not turn, and still went steadily up. But how long was it, how much more of this would they have to endure, or could they endure?</div>

<div class="line_en">The breathlessness of the air was growing as they climbed; and now they seemed often in the blind dark to sense some resistance thicker than the foul air. As they thrust forward they felt things brush against their heads, or against their hands, long tentacles, or hanging growths perhaps: they could not tell what they were. And still the stench grew. It grew, until almost it seemed to them that smell was the only clear sense left to them, and that was for their torment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="空气的凝重与时遽增，他们在这一片黑暗中似乎又遭遇到某种比空气要强韧、致密的阻力。当他们一路向前的时候，可以感觉到有什么东西拂过他们的脑袋，或是擦过他们的双手。这可能是什么寄生植物，或是某种触须。他们在黑暗中根本无法确定这些是什么东西。而且，那臭味依旧不断变浓。它不停的增加，到了最后，哈比人所有的知觉似乎都被这唯一的气味给蒙蔽了，也让他们更加痛苦。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Fighting off both the sickness and the fear, Frodo gripped Sam's hand. "Up!" he said in a hoarse breath without voice. "It all comes from here, the stench and the peril. Now for it! Quick!" Calling up his remaining strength and resolution, he dragged Sam to his feet, and forced his own limbs to move.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="佛罗多勉强压抑着恶心和无边无际的恐惧，紧抓住山姆的手说。“站起来！”他声音嘶哑的说。“这都是从这边来的，那种臭气和威胁感。快点走！快点！”他鼓起最后一丝的勇气和意志力，将山姆拉起来，强迫着自己的四肢不停移动。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At length Frodo, groping along the left-hand wall, came suddenly to a void. Almost he fell sideways into the emptiness. Here was some opening in the rock far wider than any they had yet passed; and out of it came a reek so foul, and a sense of lurking malice so intense, that Frodo reeled. And at that moment Sam too lurched and fell forwards.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到了最后，佛罗多摸索着左手边的墙壁，突然间来到了一片虚无之前。他差一点就跌进这一片空旷之中。在此，岩石间有一道比之前所遭遇到的任何地形都要宽阔的裂口，里面窜出的气味如此浓烈、威胁感更是让人毛骨悚然，佛罗多忍不住开始干呕。就在那一刻，山姆也一个踉跄，险些跌入眼前的空洞中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sam stumbled beside him. One step, two steps, three steps -- at last six steps. Maybe they had passed the dreadful unseen opening, but whether that was so or not, suddenly it was easier to move, as if some hostile will for the moment had released them. They struggled on, still hand in hand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山姆蹒跚的跟在后面。一步、两步、三步，最后他们终于跨出了第六步。或许他们通过了这散发出恐惧、不可见的开口，或许是别的原因；但他们只知道，突然间，两人的行动变得比较轻松了些。彷佛是之前的敌意松开了魔掌。他们继续挣扎着前进，依旧手牵着手。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“咕鲁到哪里去了？”山姆喘气道。“他为什么没等我们？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But almost at once they came to a new difficulty. The tunnel forked, or so it seemed, and in the dark they could not tell which was the wider way, or which kept nearer to the straight. Which should they take, the left, or the right? They knew of nothing to guide them, yet a false choice would almost certainly be fatal.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，他们几乎立刻就遭遇到了另一项难题。隧道似乎分成两条岔路，在这一片黑暗中，他们完全无法分辨究竟是哪一条比较宽阔、或哪一条比较笔直。他们到底该往哪边走？是左边，还是右边？他们完全没有任何可资判断的依据，但只要一个闪失，立刻可能危及性命。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Presently, groping and fumbling in the dark, they found that the opening on the left was blocked: either it was a blind, or else some great stone had fallen in the passage.</div>

<div class="line_en">"It's a trap!" said Sam, and he laid his hand upon the hilt of his sword; and as he did so, he thought of the darkness of the barrow whence it came. "I wish old Tom was near us now!" he thought. Then, as he stood, darkness about him and a blackness of despair and anger in his heart, it seemed to him that he saw a light: a light in his mind, almost unbearably bright at first, as a sun-ray to the eyes of one long hidden in a windowless pit. Then the light became colour: green, gold, silver, white. Far off, as in a little picture drawn by elven-fingers, he saw the Lady Galadriel standing on the grass in Lórien, and gifts were in her hands. And you, Ring-bearer, he heard her say, remote but clear, for you I have prepared this.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这是个陷阱！”山姆说，他立刻握住剑柄，当他这样作的时候，他想到在古墓岗上遭遇到的可怕景象。“我真希望汤姆在附近！”他想着。然后，在一片黑暗的包围下，在满腔怒火和绝望的激汤下，他似乎看见了一道光芒：起初它强到难以忍受，彷佛是久不见天日的人直视阳光一样痛苦。然后那光芒出现了颜色：绿色、金色、银色、白色。在遥远的地方，仿佛是由精灵之手所绘出的图案，上面显现出凯兰崔尔女皇站在罗瑞安草地上的情景，她手中拿着许多的礼物。至于你，魔戒持有者，他听见她说，遥远但却十分的清晰，我替你准备了这个。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They had not gone more than a few yards when from behind them came a sound, startling and horrible in the heavy padded silence: a gurgling, bubbling noise, and a long venomous hiss. They wheeled round, but nothing could be seen. Still as stones they stood, staring, waiting for they did not know what.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们往前走不过几码，身后就传来了一种声音；在这一片凝重的寂静中，这让人感到无比的恐惧：一种冒着泡，咕噜咕噜的声音，拖的非常长的嘶嘶声。他们转过身，但还是什么都看不见。他们只能如同雕像般的站立不动，瞪着黑暗中的未知。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The bubbling hiss drew nearer, and there was a creaking as of some great jointed thing that moved with slow purpose in the dark. A reek came on before it. "Master, master!" cried Sam, and life and urgency came back into his voice. "The Lady's gift! The star-glass! A light to you in dark places, she said it was to be. The star-glass!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那咕噜声越来越靠近，中间还夹杂着某种关节摩擦的尖锐声音。在它之前先传来的是一股臭味。“主人，主人！”生命交关的危急让他嘶哑的喉咙发出了声音。“女皇的礼物！星之光！她说这会是你在黑暗中的照明。星之光！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Slowly his hand went to his bosom, and slowly he held aloft the Phial of Galadriel. For a moment it glimmered, faint as a rising star struggling in heavy earthward mists, and then as its power waxed, and hope grew in Frodo's mind, it began to burn, and kindled to a silver flame, a minute heart of dazzling light, as though Eärendil had himself come down from the high sunset paths with the last Silmaril upon his brow. The darkness receded from it, until it seemed to shine in the centre of a globe of airy crystal, and the hand that held it sparkled with white fire.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的手缓缓伸向胸口，慢慢的高举凯兰崔尔赐给他的小玻璃瓶。一开始，它像是穿透浓密云层升起的星辰一样微弱、闪动；然后，它的光芒逐渐增强，佛罗多心中的希望也开始跃动。它开始发亮，接着化为银色的火焰，一颗闪动的光之心，仿佛埃兰迪尔亲身下凡，让额头上精灵宝钻的光芒照耀在大地。黑暗开始退缩，这光芒似乎构成了一个闪亮的透明圆球体，握着它的手也闪动着白色的火焰。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Frodo gazed in wonder at this marvellous gift that he had so long carried, not guessing its full worth and potency. Seldom had he remembered it on the road, until they came to Morgul Vale, and never had he used it for fear of its revealing light. Aiya Eärendil Elenion Ancalima! he cried, and knew not what he had spoken; for it seemed that another voice spoke through his, clear, untroubled by the foul air of the pit.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="佛罗多惊讶的瞪着这棒极了的礼物，讶异于自己随身带着它这么长的时间，竟然没有发现它的力量和光芒。直到他们来到魔窟谷之前，他在路上几乎完全忘了这个东西的存在。而且，他一路上完全不敢任意使用它；因为他担心这光芒将会暴露他们的行踪。他大喊着，自己也不知道这是什么意思；这似乎是另外一个力量借着他之口，在此地不受恶臭压抑的念诵着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But other potencies there are in Middle-earth, powers of night, and they are old and strong. And She that walked in the darkness had heard the Elves cry that cry far back in the deeps of time, and she had not heeded it, and it did not daunt her now. Even as Frodo spoke he felt a great malice bent upon him, and a deadly regard considering him. Not far down the tunnel, between them and the opening where they had reeled and stumbled, he was aware of eyes growing visible, two great clusters of many-windowed eyes -- the coming menace was unmasked at last.</div>

Then Frodo's heart flamed within him, and without thinking what he did, whether it was folly or despair or courage, he took the Phial in his left hand, and with his right hand drew his sword. Sting flashed out, and the sharp elven-blade sparkled in the silver light, but at its edges a blue fire flickered. Then holding the star aloft and the bright sword advanced, Frodo, hobbit of the Shire, walked steadily down to meet the eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“凯兰崔尔！”他大喊着，鼓起一丝勇气，奋力将星之光高举。那双眼停了下来。它似乎有了怀疑，松懈了片刻。佛罗多的心中在此时燃起了熊熊怒火，他不及多想，根本没时间考虑这倒底是愚蠢还是勇敢；就这么左手拿着星之光，右手拔出了宝剑。刺针蓝光一闪，锋利的精灵宝剑在白光的照耀下发出柔和的光芒。然后，佛罗多一手高举着星光，一手拿着宝剑；夏尔来的哈比人就这么勇气十足的迎向那双眼睛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Frodo and Sam, horror-stricken, began slowly to back away, their own gaze held by the dreadful stare of those baleful eyes; but as they backed so the eyes advanced. Frodo's hand wavered, and slowly the Phial drooped. Then suddenly, released from the holding spell to run a little while in vain panic for the amusement of the eyes, they both turned and fled together; but even as they ran Frodo looked back and saw with terror that at once the eyes came leaping up behind. The stench of death was like a cloud about him. "Stand! stand!" he cried desperately. "Running is no use."</div>

<div class="line_en">They wavered. Doubt came into them as the light approached. One by one they dimmed, and slowly they drew back. No brightness so deadly had ever afflicted them before. From sun and moon and star they had been safe underground, but now a star had descended into the very earth. Still it approached, and the eyes began to quail. One by one they all went dark; they turned away, and a great bulk, beyond the light's reach, heaved its huge shadow in between. They were gone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那双眼睛动摇了。当光芒越来越靠近的时候，它们开始有了怀疑。一个接一个，那些眼睛的光芒减弱了，它们也开始后退。之前从来没有这么致命的光芒曾经威胁过它们。它们安全的躲在地底，不受太阳、月亮和星光的威胁。但是，现在，一道星光射入了地底，而且还在不断的进逼。那些眼睛退缩了。一个接一个的，眼睛们开始熄灭，一道光芒无法分辨的巨大身影挡住了两人的视线。这些眼睛消失了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And so back they turned once more, first walking and then running; for as they went the floor of the tunnel rose steeply, and with every stride they climbed higher above the stenches of the unseen lair, and strength returned to limb and heart. But still the hatred of the Watcher lurked behind them, blind for a while, perhaps, but undefeated, still bent on death. And now there came a flow of air to meet them, cold and thin. The opening, the tunnel's end, at last it was before them. Panting, yearning for a roofless place, they flung themselves forward; and then in amazement they staggered, tumbling back. The outlet was blocked with some barrier, but not of stone: soft and a little yielding it seemed, and yet strong and impervious; air filtered through, but not a glimmer of any light. Once more they charged and were hurled back.</div>

Across the width and height of the tunnel a vast web was spun, orderly as the web of some huge spider, but denser-woven and far greater, and each thread was as thick as rope.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sam laughed grimly. "Cobwebs!" he said. "Is that all? Cobwebs! But what a spider! Have at 'em, down with 'em!" In a fury he hewed at them with his sword, but the thread that he struck did not break. It gave a little and then sprang back like a plucked bowstring, turning the blade and tossing up both sword and arm. Three times Sam struck with all his force, and at last one single cord of all the countless cords snapped and twisted, curling and whipping through the air. One end of it lashed Sam's hand, and he cried out in pain, starting back and drawing his hand across his mouth. "It will take days to clear the road like this," he said. "What's to be done?

The great smokes had risen and grown thinner, and the last hours of a sombre day were passing; the red glare of Mordor had died away in sullen gloom. Yet it seemed to Frodo that he looked upon a morning of sudden hope. Almost he had reached the summit of the wall. Only a little higher now.

How Shelob came there, flying from ruin, no tale tells, for out of the Dark Years few tales have come. But still she was there, who was there before Sauron, and before the first stone of Barad-dûr; and she served none but herself, drinking the blood of Elves and Men, bloated and grown fat with endless brooding on her feasts, weaving webs of shadow; for all living things were her food, and her vomit darkness. Far and wide her lesser broods, bastards of the miserable mates, her own offspring, that she slew, spread from glen to glen, from the Ephel Dúath to the eastern hills, to Dol Guldur and the fastnesses of Mirkwood.

Most like a spider she was, but huger than the great hunting beasts, and more terrible than they because of the evil purpose in her remorseless eyes. Those same eyes that he had thought daunted and defeated, there they were lit with a fell light again, clustering in her out-thrust head. Great horns she had, and behind her short stalk-like neck was her huge swollen body, a vast bloated bag, swaying and sagging between her legs; its great bulk was black, blotched with livid marks, but the belly underneath was pale and luminous and gave forth a stench. Her legs were bent, with great knobbed joints high above her back, and hairs that stuck out like steel spines, and at each leg's end there was a claw.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当她来的时候，山姆正好将星之光收到胸前的口袋。就在他左前方不远的地方，突然有一个前所未见，让人心胆俱裂的恐怖形体从悬崖下的另一个开口处冲了出来。这像是从人们的噩梦中苏醒过来的邪气集合体，她的身躯像是蜘蛛，但比食肉的野兽更饥渴，她眼中的智能之光让她比一般的兽类更显骇人。这些复眼就是他先前以为已经击败，退缩的眼睛。现在又再度亮起了恐怖的光芒，全都集中在她往外凸的前额上。她还长着诡异的角，在粗短的脖子后面则是臃肿变形的身体，看起来像是一个鼓涨的丑恶囊袋，在她的两腿之间淫邪的摇晃着；她巨大的身躯是黑色的上面点缀着恶心的记号，但之下的肚子则是苍白、半透明的，不停的冒出臭气。她的腿弯曲，扭曲的关节高耸于背部的高度之上，上面的毛发根根耸立，像是钢针一般，在每条腿的末端还搭配上一只爪子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Got him!" hissed Gollum in his ear. "At last, my precious, we've got him, yes, the nassty hobbit. We takes this one. She'll get the other. O yes, Shelob will get him, not Sméagol: he promised; he won't hurt Master at all. But he's got you, you nassty filthy little sneak!" He spat on Sam's neck.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“抓住了！”咕鲁在他的耳边嘶嘶的说道：“终于，我的宝贝，我们抓到他了。是的，这个臭哈比人。我们抓这个。她可以抓另一个。喔是的，尸罗会抓他，不抓史麦戈。他保证过，绝对不会伤害主人。但他还是抓到你了，你这个臭脏狡猾人！”他对着山姆的脖子吐了口痰。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sam gasped and gathered all his remaining breath to shout. "Look out behind!" he yelled. "Look out, master! I'm" -- but suddenly his cry was stifled.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山姆倒抽一口冷气，鼓起所有力气扯开喉咙大喊：“小心你后面！”他嘶吼着。“主人，小心！我——”但他的声音突然被闷住了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A long clammy hand went over his mouth and another caught him by the neck, while something wrapped itself about his leg. Taken off his guard he toppled backwards into the arms of his attacker.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一只细长、黏腻的手捂住他的嘴，另一只手则是抓住他的脖子，另外某种东西则是缠住他的双脚。不及防备的他就这么跌入了攻击者的怀抱中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Fury at the treachery, and desperation at the delay when his master was in deadly peril, gave to Sam a sudden violence and strength that was far beyond anything that Gollum had expected from this slow stupid hobbit, as he thought him. Not Gollum himself could have twisted more quickly or more fiercely. His hold on Sam's mouth slipped, and Sam ducked and lunged forward again, trying to tear away from the grip on his neck. His sword was still in his hand, and on his left arm, hanging by its thong, was Faramir's staff. Desperately he tried to turn and stab his enemy. But Gollum was too quick. His long right arm shot out, and he grabbed Sam's wrist: his fingers were like a vice; slowly and relentlessly he bent the hand down and forward, till with a cry of pain Sam released the sword and it fell to the ground; and all the while Gollum's other hand was tightening on Sam's throat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在被对方的背叛激怒，和眼看着自己无法即时驰援主人的慌张情绪下，咕鲁眼中缓慢迟的山姆突然爆发出无人能预料到的力量。咕鲁当然可以动作更快、更用力些，但是他太大意了。他的手一松，捂住山姆的手滑开了，山姆一弯身，继续往前冲，试着挣脱开脖子上的束缚。他的宝剑依旧在手中，左手臂则是挂着法拉墨送他们的手杖。他慌张中试着转过身刺杀敌人，但咕鲁的动作太快了。他细长的手伸了出来，快如疾电的抓住山姆的手腕：他的手指如同钢钳一样，无情的将山姆的手往前弯，直到山姆吃痛大叫，放开了宝剑，让它落到地上。同时间，咕鲁的另一只手则是加重了掐住山姆咽喉的力道。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then Sam played his last trick. With all his strength he pulled away and got his feet firmly planted; then suddenly he drove his legs against the ground and with his whole force hurled himself backwards.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山姆奋力的使出最后的一博。他双脚稳稳的站在地上，用尽吃奶的力气让自己往后飞去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">With a squeal Gollum let go. Then Sam waded in; not waiting to change the staff from left to right he dealt another savage blow. Quick as a snake Gollum slithered aside, and the stroke aimed at his head fell across his back. The staff cracked and broke. That was enough for him. Grabbing from behind was an old game of his, and seldom had he failed in it. But this time, misled by spite, he had made the mistake of speaking and gloating before he had both hands on his victim's neck. Everything had gone wrong with his beautiful plan, since that horrible light had so unexpectedly appeared in the darkness. And now he was face to face with a furious enemy, little less than his own size. This fight was not for him. Sam swept up his sword from the ground and raised it. Gollum squealed, and springing aside on to all fours, he jumped away in one big bound like a frog. Before Sam could reach him, he was off, running with amazing speed back towards the tunnel.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="咕鲁惊呼一声，终于松了手。山姆猛进一步，他不肯浪费时间在换手上，直接用左手再挥出一击。咕鲁滑溜的闪到一旁，原先瞄准他脑袋的一击打中了他的背部。手杖啪的一声断成两半。这对他来说已经够了。他从以前就一直偏好从背后偷袭的猎食法，极少失败。但这一次，在他自己的托大之下，竟然在两只手都掐住对方咽喉之前浪费时间在说话和羞辱对方上。自从那恐怖的光芒出现在黑暗中之后，他的计划每一步就都有了致命的缺陷。现在，他必须面对一个愤怒的敌人，对方的体型并不会逊于他。这不是他的战斗。山姆从地上捡起宝剑，准备挥出。咕鲁发出一声低嚎，四肢着地的像是大青蛙一般一跃跳开。在山姆来得及反应之前，他就用惊人的速度奔回洞穴。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Not expecting even this simple trick from Sam, Gollum fell over with Sam on top, and he received the weight of the sturdy hobbit in his stomach. A sharp hiss came out of him, and for a second his hand upon Sam's throat loosened; but his fingers still gripped the sword-hand. Sam tore himself forward and away, and stood up, and then quickly he wheeled away to his right, pivoted on the wrist held by Gollum. Laying hold of the staff with his left hand, Sam swung it up, and down it came with a whistling crack on Gollum's outstretched arm, just below the elbow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="连这么简单的把戏都在咕鲁对山姆的预料之外，因此，咕鲁在肚子上狠狠的吃了山姆全身的重量一击。他猛地吐了一口气，一瞬间松开了掐住对方咽喉的手；但抓住对方持剑手腕的那双手则毫不退让。山姆往前一冲，站了起来，靠着咕鲁抓住他的那手腕，很快的往右一旋身。山姆左手抓住手杖，往上一挥，喀拉一声，正好击中咕鲁伸出的手臂。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sword in hand Sam went after him. For the moment he had forgotten everything else but the red fury in his brain and the desire to kill Gollum. But before he could overtake him, Gollum was gone. Then as the dark hole stood before him and the stench came out to meet him, like a clap of thunder the thought of Frodo and the monster smote upon Sam's mind. He spun round, and rushed wildly up the path, calling and calling his master's name. He was too late. So far Gollum's plot had succeeded.</div>
