<div class="line_en">He left her. She slipped her bare feet into mules and wrapped herself in a kimono. She looked in the glass; she was very pale and she put on some rouge. She stood at the door for a moment, nerving herself for the interview, and then with a bold face joined him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他离开了。她把光着的脚伸进拖鞋，捡起一件晨衣披上。她坐到镜子跟前，发现自己脸色苍白，便随手涂了涂口红。她站在门外待了一会儿，用尽力气为自己鼓劲儿，然后大义凛然地走了进去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He did not look at her. He spoke gravely. She was glad to do as he asked: her knees were a little shaky, and unable to continue in that jocular tone she kept silent. He sat also and lit a cigarette. His eyes wandered restlessly about the room. He seemed to have some difficulty in starting.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的眼睛没有看她，说话的声音十分阴沉。她巴不得他叫她坐下，她的膝盖都有点儿发抖了。她也没再发表什么言论，因为她发现再将之前诙谐的谈吐继续下去已经很难了。他跟着她坐下来，点燃了一支烟。他的眼睛不停地四下张望，好像遇到了很大困难，始终开不了口。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Suddenly he looked full at her; and because he had held his eyes so long averted, his direct gaze gave her such a fright that she smothered a cry.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的眼睛忽然对准了她。他已经好久没有看她了，这一突如其来的直视让她猝不及防，差点让她叫出声来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">His eyes were still fixed on her and she could not lower hers. She tried to read his expression, but she was nervous, and she could only discern a strange watchfulness. How could he look so steadily? He did not even blink.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的眼睛始终一动不动地凝视着她，而在目光相触之后，她就再没勇气挪开了。她竭力地想从他的表情中看出什么，但可能是她的神经过于紧张，除了他少见的严峻之外，根本没看到别的。他哪来胆量一直那样看着她，连眼也不眨一下？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The French nuns are doing what they can. They've turned the orphanage into a hospital. But the people are dying like flies. I've offered to go and take charge."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“那个地方发生了瘟疫。我想这是很多年来最严重的一次。那儿原来有一个教会的医生，三天前他因为霍乱死了。还有一个法国的女修道院帮忙救人，当然还有一个海关的人。其他的人都撤走了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="她尖声叫道。她立即想到如果他走了，那她就自由了，就可以不用担惊受怕地跟查理见面了。然而她被这个想法吓了一跳，她觉得脸上忒地一下红了。他为何还那样看着她？她羞愧地把脸转向了别处。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He spoke almost flippantly and when she glanced at him she was surprised to see in his eyes a gleam of mockery. She could not understand.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I am an M. D., you know, and before I specialized I did a good deal of general work in a hospital. The fact that I'm first and foremost a bacteriologist is all to the good. It will be an admirable chance for research work."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“可是这难道不危险吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He smiled. It was a derisive grimace. She leaned her forehead on her hand. Suicide. It was nothing short of that. Dreadful! She had not thought he would take it like that. She couldn't let him do that. It was cruel. It was not her fault if she did not love him. She couldn't bear the thought that he should kill himself for her sake. Tears flowed softly down her cheeks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他微笑了，依然是古怪的嘲弄。她用一只手捂住了额头。这简直是自杀，除此之外没别的解释。她万没有想到他走了这一招，她必须阻止他，不然就太残酷了。不爱他并不是她的错啊，他不能为了她的缘故而动了轻生的念头。想到这里她的神经再也承受不了，泪水一珠珠地从脸上淌下来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“但是很显然那里不是女人应该去的地方。那个传教士医生几个礼拜前就把他的妻子和孩子送走了。牧师会会长夫妇刚到香港来，我在一个茶会上见过他夫人。我刚想起来她说过他们刚离开一个发生了霍乱的地方。”">查看中文翻译</div>

She saw in it a look of hatred. Was it possible that he wanted her to die? She answered her own outrageous thought.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他没有做声。她望着他，陷入了歇斯底里的绝望之中，随时可能哭号起来。他的脸色变成了死灰色，她更加害怕起来。她从他的眼神里看到了憎恶。难道他想故意害死她吗？她狂暴地喊了起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

I could never stand the heat up there. And cholera: I should be frightened out of my wits. It's just asking for trouble. There's no reason for me to go. I should die."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不明白你是什么意思。如果我去那就是疯了。你知道我的身子有多弱不禁风。赫华德医生执意要我找个香港以外的地方避暑。这儿的炎热都够我受的，更别提霍乱。听一听我都会吓得神经错乱，去那地方不就等于自讨苦吃吗？我没有理由跟你去，我会死的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's absurd. If you think you ought to go it's your own lookout. But really you can't expect me to. I hate illness. A cholera epidemic.
