<div class="line_en">Bolstered by the destruction of the locket, they set to debating the possible locations of the other Horcruxes, and even though they had discussed the matter so often before, Harry felt optimistic, certain that more breakthroughs would succeed the first. Hermione's sulkiness could not mar his buoyant spirits: The sudden upswing in their fortunes, the appearance of the mysterious doe, the recovery of Gryffindor's sword, and above all, Ron's return, made Harry so happy that it was quite difficult to maintain a straight face.</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry had not expected Hermione's anger to abate overnight, and was therefore unsurprised that she communicated mainly by dirty looks and pointed silences the next morning. Ron responded by maintaining an unnaturally somber demeanor in her presence as an outward sign of continuing remorse. In fact, when all three of them were together Harry felt like the only non-mourner at a poorly attended funeral. During those few moments he spent alone with Harry, however (collecting water and searching the undergrowth for mushrooms), Ron became shamelessly cheery.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利没指望赫敏的怒气一夜就会消掉，所以第二天早上见她基本只用阴沉的脸色和明显的沉默交流，他并不意外。罗恩在她面前保持着不自然的严肃态度，作为继续忏悔的表现。实际上，当三人在一起时，哈利觉得自己像人数寥寥的葬礼上惟一不在哀悼的人。但在与哈利单独相处的不多时间里（打水、在树丛下找蘑菇），罗恩就会肆无忌惮地快活起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Late in the afternoon he and Ron escaped Hermione's baleful presence again, and under the pretense of scouring the bare hedges for nonexistent blackberries, they continued their ongoing exchange of news. Harry had finally managed to tell Ron the whole story of his and Hermione's various wanderings, right up to the full story of what had happened at Godric's Hollow; Ron was now filling Harry in on everything he had discovered about the wider Wizarding world during his weeks away.</div>

"Course, if things were different, it'd be huge news, Dumbledore being pals with Grindelwald, but now it's just something to laugh about for people who didn't like Dumbledore, and a bit of a slap in the face for everyone who thought he was such a good bloke. I don't know that it's such a big deal, though. He was really young when they --"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，听到了，”罗恩马上说，“人们议论很多。当然，要是在别的形势下，这会是个特大新闻——邓布利多跟格林德沃是好朋友。可现在，只不过是给了不喜欢邓布利多的人一个笑柄，给了所有认为他多么完美的人一记耳光。我倒没觉得有什么大不了，他那时还很年轻——”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="蜘蛛没有缩小。哈利低头看着黑刺李木魔杖。他那天用它施过的每个小魔法似乎都不如凤凰尾羽魔杖施的有力。新魔杖拿在手里陌生而别扭，就像把别人的手缝到他的胳膊上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He knew why she wanted it to be all right: She still felt guilty about breaking his wand. He bit back the retort that sprang to his lips, that she could take the blackthorn wand if she thought it made no difference, and he would have hers instead. Keen for them all to be friends again, however, he agreed; but when Ron gave Hermione a tentative smile, she stalked off and vanished behind her book once more.</div>

<div class="line_en">All three of them returned to the tent when darkness fell, and Harry took first watch. Sitting in the entrance, he tried to make the blackthorn wand levitate small stones at his feet; but his magic still seemed clumsier and less powerful than it had done before. Hermione was lying on her bunk reading, while Ron, after many nervous glances up at her, had taken a small wooden wireless out of his rucksack and started to try and tune it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="夜幕降临，三人一起回到帐篷里，哈利值第一班。他坐在帐篷口，试着用黑刺李木魔杖让脚边的小石头升起，但魔法好像还是不如以前流畅有力。赫敏躺在床上看书，罗恩不安地瞟了她好多眼之后，从背包里掏出一个小小的木壳收音机，开始调台。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"There's this one program," he told Harry in a low voice, "that tells the news like it really is. All the others are on You-Know-Who's side and are following the Ministry line, but this one… you wait till you hear it, it's great. Only they can't do it every night, they have to keep changing locations in case they're raided, and you need a password to tune in… Trouble is, I missed the last one…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“有一个节目，”他悄声告诉哈利，“播的是真实的新闻。其他电台都倒向神秘人一边，遵循魔法部的路线，但这一个……你听了就知道，精彩极了。只是他们不能每晚都播，怕受到突袭，不得不经常换地方，而且你得知道暗号才能收到……问题是，我上次没听着……”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He drummed lightly on the top of the radio with his wand, muttering random words under his breath. He threw Hermione many covert glances, plainly fearing an angry outburst, but for all the notice she took of him he might not have been there. For ten minutes or so Ron tapped and muttered, Hermione turned the pages of her book, and Harry continued to practice with the blackthorn wand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他用魔杖轻轻敲着收音机顶部，小声念着胡乱想到的词，一边偷偷瞥着赫敏，显然害怕她发作，但赫敏却只当他根本不存在一样。有十分钟左右，罗恩边敲边念，赫敏翻着书页，哈利继续用黑刺李木魔杖练习魔法。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He obeyed. For a moment he had no idea what she was talking about, but, looking more closely with the aid of his lit wand, he saw that Dumbledore had replaced the A of Albus with a tiny version of the same triangular mark insCRIbed upon The Tales of Beedle the Bard.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他看了，一时不明白她在说什么，但借着魔杖的荧光细看时，他发现邓布利多签名中阿不思的第一个字母A是个小小的、像《诗翁彼豆故事集》中那样的三角形符号。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I bought it," said Xenophilius dogmatically, "two weeks ago, from a delightful young wizard who knew of my interest in the exquisite Snorkack. A Christmas surprise for my Luna. Now," he said, turning to Harry, "why exactly have you come here, Mr. Potter?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Xenophilius did not answer. He kept swallowing, his eyes darting between the three of them. Harry had the impression that he was undergoing some painful internal struggle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="谢诺菲留斯没有回答，不停地咽着唾沫，目光在三人之间扫来扫去。哈利觉得他内心在进行着某种痛苦的斗争。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Xenophilius gulped. He seemed to be steeling himself. Finally he said in a shaky voice difficult to hear over the noise of the printing press, "Luna is down at the stream, fishing for Freshwater Plimpies. She… she will like to see you. I'll go and call her and then -- yes, very well. I shall try to help you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="谢诺菲留斯噎住了。他似乎在硬下心肠，最后，他用颤抖的、在印刷机的噪音中几乎听不见的声音说：“卢娜在下面小溪边捕淡水彩球鱼呢。她……她会高兴见到你们的。我去叫她，然后——嗯，好吧，我会尽量帮助你们。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He disappeared down the spiral staircase and they heard the front door open and close. They looked at each other.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他从螺旋形楼梯下去，接着传来前门开关的声音，三人对视了一下。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry crossed to the window on the far side of the room. He could see a stream, a thin, glittering ribbon lying far below them at the base of the hill. They were very high up; a bird fluttered past the window as he stared in the direction of the Burrow, now invisible beyond another line of hills. Ginny was over there somewhere. They were closer to each other today than they had been since Bill and Fleur's wedding, but she could have no idea he was gazing toward her now, thinking of her. He supposed he ought to be glad of it; anyone he came into contact with was in danger, Xenophilius's attitude proved that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利走到房间那头的窗口。他望见一条小溪，像一条闪闪发光的细带子躺在远远的山底。他们这里很高，一只小鸟从窗前飞过。他遥望陋居，被另一片青山挡住了看不见。金妮在山的那边，自从比尔和芙蓉的婚礼之后，他和她还从来没有距离这么近过。但她不可能知道他正在遥望她、思念她。他想也许该为此庆幸，因为凡是他接触的人都会有危险，谢诺菲留斯的态度证明了这一点。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He turned away from the window and his gaze fell upon another peculiar object standing upon the cluttered, curved sideboard: a stone bust of a beautiful but austere-looking witch wearing a most bizarre-looking headdress. Two objects that resembled golden ear trumpets curved out from the sides. A tiny pair of glittering blue wings was stuck to a leather strap that ran over the top of her head, while one of the orange radishes had been stuck to a second strap around her forehead.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他转身离开了窗口，目光落在另一件奇异的东西上：一座半身石像立在乱糟糟的弧形柜子上，是一个美丽但面容严厉的女巫。她戴的头饰古怪透顶，两边伸出一对弯弯的、金色助听筒似的东西，一双闪闪发光的蓝色小翅膀插在头顶箍的皮带上，而额头的另一道箍上插着个橘红色的小萝卜。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"May I offer you all an infusion of Gurdyroots?" said Xenophilius. "We make it ourselves." As he started to pour out the drink, which was as deeply purple as beetroot juice, he added, "Luna is down beyond Bottom Bridge, she is most excited that you are here. She ought not to be too long, she has caught nearly enough Plimpies to make soup for all of us. Do sit down and help yourselves to sugar.</div>
