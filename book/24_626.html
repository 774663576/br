<div class="line_en">He heard the door open behind him, but did not turn his head as Pieter Van Ryberg came into the room. There was the inevitable pause as Pieter looked disapprovingly at the thermostat, for it was a standing joke that the Secretary-General liked living in an icebox. Stormgren waited until his assistant joined him at the window, then tore his gaze away from the familiar yet always fascinating panorama below.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Secretary-General of the United Nations stood motionless by the great window, staring down at the crawling traffic on 43rd Street. He sometimes wondered if it was a good thing for any man to work at such an altitude above his fellow humans. Detachment was all very well, but it could change so easily to indifference. Or was he merely trying to rationalize his dislike of skyscrapers, still unabated after twenty years in New York?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="联合国秘书长斯妥格恩一动不动地站在办公室窗前，俯瞰43街上往来不息的车流。远离人群，在这样一座俯视芸芸众生的高楼里工作，究竟是不是件好事？他有时忍不住问自己。超然一点当然很好，但这种超然很容易变成漠然。或许，自己只是在找借口——在纽约已经生活了二十年，还是不喜欢这里的摩天大楼。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Stormgren picked up his notebook and rejoined his assistant. Half a mile away, a small but determined crowd was moving slowly towards the Secretariat Building. It carried banners that were indecipherable at this distance, but Stormgren knew their message well enough. Presently he could hear, rising above the sound of the traffic, the ominous rhythm of chanting voices. He felt a sudden wave of disgust sweep over him. Surely the world had had enough of marching mobs and angry slogans!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯妥格恩拿起记事本，走到窗前。半里地之外，一群人正手舞旗帜，昂首阔步地朝联合国大厦走来，只是隔得太远，看不清旗帜上写些什么——其实就是不看也能猜到。人群高唱着悲歌，声音盖过了车辆的噪音。听着这样的歌声，一股厌烦之情油然而生。世界上的游行队伍也太多了，愤怒的口号声总是此起彼伏。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Stormgren had walked to his desk and was fidgeting with his famous uranium paperweight. He was not nervous-merely undecided. He was also glad that Wainwright was late, for that would give him a slight moral advantage when the interview opened. Such trivialities played a greater part in human affairs than anyone who set much store on logic and reason might wish.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯妥格恩走到办公桌边，拿起那块铀石镇纸摆弄着。他并不紧张，只是不知道该谈什么好。维因莱特迟到了，对自己来说是件好事，这样，在会谈开始时，自己就占据了某种道义上的优势。莫看这类事小，在人类交往中发挥的作用大大超乎人们的想象，甚至比起人们在会谈前做的各种逻辑、理由上的准备还要重要。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And very probably, thought Stormgren, Karellen was watching the whole thing and enjoying himself hugely, for this meeting would never have taken place except at the Supervisor's instigation.</div>

<div class="line_en">Alexander Wainwright was a tall, handsome man in the late forties. He was, Stormgren knew, completely honest, and therefore doubly dangerous. Yet his obvious sincerity made it hard to dislike him, whatever views one might have about the cause for which he stood -- and some of the followers he had attracted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="维因莱特年近五十，高高的个儿，相貌堂堂，性情笃厚。诚实的品性使他显得越发危险——因为他诚实，不管人们如何看待他做的事，都很难对他和他的支持者们产生厌恶情绪。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The crowd had now come abreast of the building; it must know that he was watching, for here and there fists were being shaken, rather self-consciously, in the air. They were not defying him, though the gesture was doubtless meant for Stormgren to see. As pygmies may threaten a giant, so those angry fists were directed against the sky fifty kilometres above his head-against the gleaming silver cloud that was the flagship of the Overlord fleet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="人群来到了大厦前，他们知道秘书长一定在楼上看着他们，不时挥舞着拳头以示抗议，斯妥格恩明白这一切都是做给他看的，这些人针对的不是他，而是五十公里以外高空中旗舰里的那位地球统治者。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This was the first time that Stormgren had ever met the head of the Freedom League. He had ceased to wonder if the action was wise, for Karellen's plans were often too subtle for merely human understanding. At the worst, Stormgren did not see that any positive harm could be done. If he had refused to see Wainwright, the League would have used the fact as ammunition against him.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="等瑞伯格介绍完，斯妥格恩首先开口了：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="维因莱特严肃地点点头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That is my main protest, Mr. Secretary. As you know, for the last five years we have tried to awaken the human race to the danger that confronts it. The task has been a difficult one, for the majority of people seem content to let the Overlords run the world as they please. Nevertheless, more than five million patriots, in every country, have signed our petition."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这将是一次大规模的抗议活动，秘书长先生。您知道，五年来，我们一直致力于唤起人类的危难意识。这是一项艰巨的任务。虽然大多数人好像都乐意让那些外来统治者管理我们的世界，但仍有五百万人联合签名，要求举行这样的抗议活动。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What does anyone know of Karellen's powers?" retorted Stormgren. "When I was a boy, the Federation of Europe was a dream -- but when I grew to manhood it had become reality. And that was before the arrival of the Overlords. Karellen is merely finishing the work we had begun."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“又有谁知道卡瑞林的能耐呢？”斯妥格恩反驳道，“我小的时候，欧洲共同体还只是个梦想，等到我长大，它已经成了现实，这还是他们没有到地球之前的事。卡瑞林只是在帮助我们完成那些我们自己已经开始的事情。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"To the Overlords," replied Stormgren sarcastically, "the Earth is probably a great deal smaller than Europe seemed to our fathers -- and their outlook, I submit, is more mature than ours."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“对那些外星来的统治者来说，”斯妥格恩嘲讽地说，“地球可能比当初我们祖先看到的欧洲还要小，而且我相信他们的思想比我们成熟多了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I do not necessarily quarrel with Federation as an ultimate objective -- though many of my supporters might not agree. But it must come from within -- not be superimposed from without. We must work out our own destiny. There must be no more interference in human affairs!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我的许多支持者把反对世界联邦作为终极目标，我不这样想，因为问题的关键在于这个联邦必须是我们自己的联邦，而不是撇开人类利益、屈从于外来力量的傀儡组织！我们要掌握自己的命运，决不允许那些外星人来干预我们的一切事务！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Stormgren sighed. All this he had heard a hundred times before, and he knew that he could only give the old answer that the Freedom League had refused to accept. He had faith in Karellen, and they had not. That was the fundamental difference, and there was nothing he could do about it. Luckily, there was nothing that the Freedom League could do, either.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯妥格恩叹了口气，这些话都听了上百遍，答案也始终只有一个。他本人信任卡瑞林，而这些人不，这就是最根本的区别。对这样的请求没有别的解决办法，好在自由团也闹不出什么名堂来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At last, thought Stormgren, we've got to the point. Basically, the conflict is a religious one, however much it may be disguised.

<div class="line_en">"There is one other point," said Wainwright slowly. "We have many objections to the Overlords -- but above all we detest their secretiveness. You are the only human being who has ever spoken with Karellen, and even you have never seen him! Is it surprising that we doubt his motives?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“还有一点，”维因莱特慢慢说道，“我们最反感、最讨厌他们神神秘秘的样子。你是唯一有机会和卡瑞林谈话的人，就连你自己也没有见过他的面。这怎么能不让我们怀疑他的动机呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And on the sixth day, Karellen, Supervisor for Earth, made himself known to the world in a broadcast that blanketed every radio frequency. He spoke in English so perfect that the controversy it began was to rage across the Atlantic for a generation. But the context of the speech was more staggering even than its delivery. By any standards, it was a work of superlative genius, showing a complete and absolute mastery of human affairs. There could be no doubt that its scholarship and virtuosity, its tantalizing glimpses of knowledge still untapped were deliberately designed to convince mankind that it was in the presence of overwhelming intellectual power. When Karellen had finished, the nations of Earth knew that their days of precarious sovereignty had ended. Local, internal governments would still retain their powers, but in the wider field of international affairs the supreme decisions had passed from human hands. Arguments-protests-all were futile.</div>

<div class="line_en">Yet nothing whatsoever had happened. The great ship floated unharmed, bathed in the raw sunlight at the edge of space. Not only had the bomb failed to touch it, but no one could ever decide what had happened to the missile. Moreover, Karellen took no action against those responsible, or even indicated that he had known of the attack. He ignored them contemptuously, leaving them to worry over a vengeance that never came. It was a more effective, and more demoralizing, treatment than any punitive action could have been. The government responsible collapsed completely in mutual recrimination a few weeks later.</div>

<div class="line_en">Nor did they. All that happened was that as the sun passed the meridian at Cape Town -- it went out. There remained visible merely a pale, purple ghost, giving no heat or light. Somehow, out in space, the light of the sun had been polarized by two crossed fields so that no radiation could pass. The area affected was five hundred kilometres across, and perfectly circular.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后期限到了，一切照旧。正午时分，开普敦上空的太阳突然消失了，天上只剩下两片相互交叉的淡紫色阴影，没有光，也没有热，阳光照在上面，被折射出去了，阴影下面方圆五百公里的地方没有一丝阳光。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When it became clear that no attempt would be made to end discrimination, Karellen gave his warning. It merely named a date and time -- no more. There was apprehension, but little fear or panic, for no-one believed that the Overlords would take any violent or destructive action which would involve innocent and guilty alike.</div>

<div class="line_en">Apart from such isolated incidents, the human race had accepted the Overlords as part of the natural order of things. In a surprisingly short time, the initial shock had worn off, and the world went about its business again. The greatest change a suddenly awakened Rip Van Winkle would have noticed was a hushed expectancy, a mental glancing-over-the-shoulder, as mankind waited for the Overlords to show themselves and to step down from their gleaming ships.</div>

<div class="line_en">There was the usual circle of sightseers, cameras at the ready, as Stormgren's car drove on to the launching-field. The Secretary-General exchanged a few final words with his assistant, collected his brief case, and walked through the ring of spectators.</div>

<div class="line_en">Karellen never kept him waiting for long. There was a sudden "Oh!" from the crowd, and a silver bubble expanded with breathtaking speed in the sky above. A gust of air tore at Stormgren's clothes as the tiny ship came to rest fifty metres away, floating delicately a few centimetres above the ground, as if it feared contamination with Earth. As he walked slowly forward, Stormgren saw that familiar puckering of the seamless metallic hull, and in a moment the opening that had so baffled the world's best scientists appeared before him. He stepped through it into the ship's single, softly-lit room. The entrance sealed itself as if it had never been, shutting out all sound and sight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡瑞林没有让他久等。一只银色的小飞船从天上飞驰而来，越来越大，人群中传来惊叹声。随着一股很强的气流，飞船停在五十米之外，舱体和地面保持着几厘米的距离，好像怕被地球污染似的。斯妥格恩的衣服被吹开了，他缓步朝飞船走去。飞船的舱体浑然一体，没有任何缝隙，忽然，一道门奇迹般地出现了。就是这道门，也够地球上最好的科学家琢磨很长时间。跨过这道门，就进了飞船上唯一的房间，里面亮着柔和的光。随后门关上了，就好像从来没有存在过似的。外面的声音和光线都消失了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It opened again five minutes later. There had been no sensation of movement, but Stormgren knew that he was now fifty kilometres above the Earth, deep in the heart of Karellen's ship. He was in the world of the Overlords; all around him, they were going about their mysterious business. He had come nearer to them than had any other man; yet he knew no more of their physical nature than did any of the millions on the world below.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="五分钟之后，门再度打开了。斯妥格恩知道，虽然自己没有感觉到飞船移动，但他已经在离地球五十公里之外的高空了，而且就在卡瑞林的飞船里面。这是个外星人的世界，他们就在附近，做着种种神秘的事情。虽说自己是地球上惟一离他们最近的人，但和其他人一样，他也从来没有见过他们。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sometimes in his dreams Stormgren had imagined that it had suddenly flashed into life, revealing the secret that tormented all the world.

<div class="line_en">"He's an honest man, even if many of his supporters aren't. What are we going to do about him?

<div class="line_en">From the hidden grille came that calm, never-hurried voice that Stormgren knew so well though the world had heard it only once in history. Its depth and resonance gave the single clue that existed in Karellen's physical nature, for it left an overwhelming impression of sheer size. Karellen was large -- perhaps much larger than a man.

<div class="line_en">"That, Rikki, is the fear that torments them, even though they will never admit it openly. Believe me, it gives us no pleasure to destroy men's faiths, but all the world's religions cannot be right, and they know it. Sooner or later man has to learn the truth; but that time is not yet. As for our secrecy, which you are correct in saying aggravates our problems -- that is a matter beyond my control. I regret the need for this concealment as much as you do, but the reasons are sufficient. However, I will try and get a statement from my -- superiors -- which may satisfy you and perhaps placate the Freedom League. Now, please, can we return to the agenda and start recording again?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“雷克，他们怕的就是这个，尽管他们不敢公开承认。相信我，我们对破坏他们的信仰毫无兴趣，这一点他们自己也明白。人类迟早会知道真相的，只是现在还不是时候。至于我们不露面一事，你说得对，它的确给我们带来了不少麻烦，但我们也不能自作主张。对此我和你一样感到遗憾，尽管我们有充分的理由这样做。我问问我的统治者吧，希望能给你一个满意的答复。好，我们现在再看着事务日程，把它都记下来。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You know why Wainwright and his type fear me, don't you?" asked Karellen. His voice was somber now, like a great organ rolling its notes from a high cathedral nave. "You will find men like him in all the world's religions. They know that we represent reason and science, and however confident they may be in their beliefs, they fear that we will overthrow their gods. Not necessarily through any deliberate act, but in a subtler fashion. Science can destroy religion by ignoring it as well as by disproving its tenets. No one ever demonstrated, so far as I am aware, the nonexistence of Zeus or Thor, but they have few followers now. The Wainwrights fear, too, that we know the truth about the origins of their faiths. How long, they wonder, have we been observing humanity? Have we watched Mohammed begin the Hegira, or Moses giving the Jews their laws? Do we know all that is false in the stories they believe?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你知道维因莱特和他那帮手下为什么怕我吗？”卡瑞林问，那声音就像从教堂大殿的梁上传下来，带着些忧郁，“这个世界上林林总总的宗教中不乏他这样的人。他们很清楚我们代表的是智慧和科学，他们害怕我们有朝一日会推翻他们笃信的神明。其实要推翻他们的信仰，只是水到渠成的事，不费吹灰之力，根本用不着刻意做什么，科学自然能证明那些教义的错误。时至今日，尽管没有人说希腊神话中的宙斯和北欧神话中的雷神不存在，但信奉他们的人却越来越少了。维因莱特还担心我们知道他们那些信仰的真正起源，他们不知道我们观察人类有多久了，他们还想知道我们是否明白他们信奉的那些故事都是假的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“不知道，”斯妥格恩随手将文件往桌上一扔，身子瘫软在椅子中，疲惫地回答道，“卡瑞林现在正在向他的统治者请示，天知道他的统治者长什么样儿。他本人没有作任何承诺。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, he often refers to his position here as something temporary, hindering him from getting on with his real work, which I think is some form of mathematics. Once I mentioned Acton's quotation about power corrupting, and absolute power corrupting absolutely. I wanted to see how he'd react to that. He gave that cavernous laugh of his, and said; 'There's no danger of that happening to me. In the first case, the sooner I finish my work here, the sooner I can get back to where I belong, a good many light-years from here. And secondly, I don't have absolute power, by any means. I'm just -- Supervisor.' Of course, he may have been misleading me. I can never be sure of that."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh yes, quite often -- but only on trivial points. I think he has an absolutely perfect memory, but there are some things he hasn't bothered to learn. For instance, English is the only language he understands completely, though in the last two years he's picked up a good deal of Finnish just to tease me. And one doesn't learn Finnish in a hurry! He can quote great slabs of the 'Kalevala', whereas I'm ashamed to say I know only a few lines. He also knows the biographies of all living statesmen, and sometimes I can identify the references he's used. His knowledge of history and science seems complete -- you know how much we've already learned from him.

Their shadow was everywhere, but it was an unobtrusive shadow. Though there were few great cities on Earth where men could not see one of the silver ships glittering against the zenith, after a little while they were taken as much for granted as the sun, moon or clouds. Most men were probably only dimly aware that their steadily rising standards of living were due to the Overlords. When they stopped to think of it -- which was seldom -- they realized that those silent ships had brought peace to all the world for the first time in history, and were duly grateful.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在外星人来到地球的第一年里，他们对人们生活方式的影响并没有想象的那么大。尽管他们的踪迹随处可见，几乎所有城市的上空都能看到飞船，但一点妨碍也没有，不久，人们就习以为常了，那些飞船就像天上的太阳、月亮和云朵一样，成了生活的一部分。大多数人认为自己生活水平不断提高应归功于这些外星人统治者，一些人在闲暇之余还会因记起是他们给人类带来了前所未有的和平而心存感激，但这种时候很少。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But these were negative and unspectacular benefits, accepted and soon forgotten. The Overlords remained aloof, hiding their faces from mankind. Karellen could command respect and admiration; he could win nothing deeper so long as he pursued his present policy. It was hard not to feel resentment against these Olympians who spoke to man only over the radio-teleprinter circuits at United Nations Headquarters. What took place between Karellen and Stormgren was never publicly revealed, and sometimes Stormgren himself wondered why the Supervisor found these interviews necessary.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这些好处都是间接的，不怎么引人注目，人们得到了很快就忘了。那些统治者依然高高在上，不肯露面。卡瑞林可以要求人们尊敬他，崇拜他，但如果继续现有政策，他不可能获得人心，对这种只通过联合国大厦里那套远程无线电传打字机系统来与人交流的“天神”，人们很难心存好感。卡瑞林和斯妥格恩之间是如何进行交流的从来没有公开披露过，有时连斯妥格恩自己都纳闷儿，这种交流有必要吗！">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Perhaps he felt the need of direct contact with one human being at least; perhaps he realized that Stormgren needed this form of personal support. If this was the explanation, the Secretary-General appreciated it; he did not mind if the Freedom League referred to him contemptuously as "Karellen's office-boy".</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="也许，卡瑞林认为至少得和地球上的某个人保持直接联系；也许他认为斯妥格恩需要帮助。如果是后种想法，斯妥格恩很感激，也不会介意被自由团的人称作“卡瑞林的跑腿。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Overlords had never had any dealings with individual states and governments; they had taken the United Nations Organization as they found it, given instructions for installing the necessary radio equipment, and issued their orders through the mouth of the Secretary-General. The Soviet delegate had quite correctly pointed out, at considerable length and upon innumerable occasions, that this was not in accordance with the Charter. Karellen did not seem to worry.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这些统治者从来没有和任何国家或政府单独签订过任何协议，他们一来就选中了联合国，指导人们在联合国大厦里装上了必需的无线电设备，接着就通过秘书长发布命令。苏联代表曾指出，在很大程度和范围上，这样的做法不符合联合国宪章。卡瑞林似乎并不在意。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was amazing that so many abuses, follies and evils could be dispelled by those messages from the sky. With the arrival of the Overlords, nations knew that they need no longer fear each other, and they guessed -- even before the experiment was made -- that their existing weapons were certainly impotent against a civilization that could bridge the stars. So at once the greatest single obstacle to the happiness of mankind had been removed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="奇怪的是，自从有了这些空中传来的命令，人们的很多陋习、荒诞事以及罪恶都消失了。外星人来了之后，国家之间不再彼此害怕。早在那次大胆尝试之前，他们就料到了自己的武器和那种能够在星际间往返的文明根本无法相提并论。人类走向幸福的障碍就这样被清除了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Overlords seemed largely indifferent to forms of government, provided that they were not oppressive or corrupt. Earth still possessed democracies, monarchies, benevolent dictatorships, communism and capitalism. This was a source of great surprise to many simple souls who were quite convinced that theirs was the only possible way of life. Others believed that Karellen was merely waiting to introduce a system that would sweep away all existing forms of society, and so had not bothered with minor political reforms. But this, like all other speculations concerning the Overlords, was pure guesswork. No one knew their motives; and no one knew towards what future they were shepherding mankind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="统治者对各类政治体制一点也不感兴趣，只要它们不压迫人、不腐败就行。地球上仍然保留了民主制度、君主制度、共产主义制度和资本主义制度。这样的格局让那些思想单一、认为只有自己的制度才可能存在的人大为吃惊。还有些人认为卡瑞林是在等待时机引进一种全新的制度来取代所有现存制度，所以懒得理会那些小的政治变革。但这也和其他有关外星人的推测一样，只是个猜想。没有人知道他们的真实目的，也不知道他们要把人类引向何方。">查看中文翻译</div>
