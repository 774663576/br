<div class="line_en">The enormity of his decision not to race Voldemort to the wand still scared Harry. He could not remember, ever before, choosing not to act. He was full of doubts, doubts that Ron could not help voicing whenever they were together.</div>

<div class="line_en">Bill and Fleur's cottage stood alone on a cliff overlooking the sea, its walls embedded with shells and whitewashed. It was a lonely and beautiful place. Wherever Harry went inside the tiny cottage or its garden, he could hear the constant ebb and flow of the sea, like the breathing of some great, slumbering creature. He spent much of the next few days making excuses to escape the crowded cottage, craving the cliff-top view of open sky and wide, empty sea, and the feel of cold, salty wind on his face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="比尔和芙蓉的小屋孤零零地屹立在悬崖之上，俯视着大海，墙壁是贝壳嵌成的，刷成了白色。这是一个孤独而美丽的地方。哈利在小屋和花园中无论走到哪儿，都能听到持续的潮起潮落的声音，像某个巨大的怪物沉睡时的呼吸。在接下来的几天里，他一直在寻找借口逃离拥挤的小屋，渴望悬崖顶上辽阔的天空的宽广、空寂的大海，以及冰冷的、咸咸的海风吹拂面颊的感觉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Harry, if that really is the Elder Wand, how the hell are we supposed to finish off You-Know-Who?" Harry had no answers: There were moments when he wondered whether it had been outright madness not to try to prevent Voldemort breaking open the tomb. He could not even explain satisfactorily why he had decided against it: Every time he tried to reconstruct the internal arguments that had led to his decision, they sounded feebler to him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利没有答案：有的时候他在疑惑，没有试图阻止伏地魔砸开坟墓，是不是十分愚蠢的行为。他甚至不能满意地解释为什么他决定不去反抗：每一次他试图推想导致他做出决定的内心依据，都觉得它们越来越站不住脚。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But the idea of Dumbledore's corpse frightened Harry much less than the possibility that he might have misunderstood the living Dumbledore's intentions. He felt that he was still groping in the dark; he had chosen his path but kept looking back, wondering whether he had misread the signs, whether he should not have taken the other way. From time to time, anger at Dumbledore crashed over him again, powerful as the waves slamming themselves against the cliff beneath the cottage, anger that Dumbledore had not explained before he died.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是哈利觉得，比起可能误解邓布利多生前的意图，面对邓布利多的遗体倒并不那么可怕。他感到自己仍然在黑暗中摸索，选择了一条路却不停地回头看，怀疑是否读错了路标，是否本该走另外一条路。对邓布利多的恼恨不时地再次涌上他的心头，就像小屋下面的海水击打悬崖一般强烈，他恼恨邓布利多在去世前没有解释清楚。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But is he dead?" said Ron, three days after they had arrived at the cottage. Harry had been staring out over the wall that separated the cottage garden from the cliff when Ron and Hermione had found him; he wished they had not, having no wish to join in with their argument.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“但是他死了吗？”在他们抵达小屋三天后，罗恩说。刚才哈利正凝望着花园与悬崖之间的隔墙外面，两个同伴找到了他。哈利不想加入他们的争辩，真的希望他们没有找来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The odd thing was that Hermione's support made him feel just as confused as Ron's doubts. Now forced to accept that the Elder Wand was real, she maintained that it was an evil object, and that the way Voldemort had taken possession of it was repellent, not to be considered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="奇怪的是，赫敏的支持和罗恩的怀疑同样让他感到困惑。在被迫承认老魔杖真的存在后，赫敏坚持认为它是一个邪恶的东西，认为伏地魔占有它的方式是令人厌恶的，想都不该想的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I can't stay long, I must get back," said Lupin, beaming around at them all: He looked years younger than Harry had ever seen him. "Thank you, thank you, Bill."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不能待得太久，必须回去。”卢平说，冲着大家眉开眼笑，看上去比哈利见过的任何时候都年轻了好几岁，“谢谢你，谢谢你，比尔。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I think he looks like Dora, but she thinks he is like me. Not much hair. It looked black when he was born, but I swear it's turned ginger in the hour since. Probably be blond by the time I get back. Andromeda says Tonks's hair started changing color the day that she was born." He drained his goblet. "Oh, go on then, just one more," he added, beaming, as Bill made to fill it again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我认为他像朵拉，可是朵拉认为像我。头发不多，刚出生时看上去是黑色的，但是我发誓一小时后就变成了姜黄色，很可能到我回去时就是金黄色了。安多米达说唐克斯出生第一天头发就开始变色。”卢平把酒一饮而尽，“哦，再来一杯。”他笑眯眯地添了一句，比尔又给他加了酒。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The wind buffeted the little cottage and the fire leapt and crackled, and Bill was soon opening another bottle of wine. Lupin's news seemed to have taken them out of themselves, removed them for a while from their state of siege: Tidings of new life were exhilarating. Only the goblin seemed untouched by the suddenly festive atmosphere, and after a while he slunk back to the bedroom he now occupied alone. Harry thought he was the only one who had noticed this, until he saw Bill's eyes following the goblin up the stairs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="狂风吹打着小屋，炉火跳跃着，噼啪作响，比尔很快又打开了一瓶酒。卢平带来的消息似乎让他们都忘记了自我，暂时从被困的状态中解放了出来：新生命诞生的信息令人振奋。惟有那个妖精似乎对突如其来的节日气氛无动于衷，不一会儿就溜回他现在独住的卧室去了。哈利原以为只有他一个人注意到，忽然发现比尔的目光盯着妖精上了楼梯。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Then I have to say this," Bill went on. "If you have struck any kind of bargain with Griphook, and most particularly if that bargain involves treasure, you must be exceptionally careful. Goblin notions of ownership, payment, and repayment are not the same as human ones."</div>

<div class="line_en">"We are talking about a different breed of being," said Bill. "Dealings between wizards and goblins have been fraught for centuries -- but you'll know all that from History of Magic. There has been fault on both sides, I would never claim that wizards have been innocent. However, there is a belief among some goblins, and those at Gringotts are perhaps most prone to it, that wizards cannot be trusted in matters of gold and treasure, that they have no respect for goblin ownership."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们是在讨论另一种生物，”比尔说，“许多个世纪以来，巫师和妖精的交往充满矛盾——这些你都可以从魔法史中去了解。双方都曾有过错，我绝不会说巫师清白无辜。然而，一些妖精认为——古灵阁的妖精也许更容易认为：涉及金子和财宝时，巫师就不可信任，并且巫师不尊重妖精的所有权。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"-- then they would consider it rented by the one who had paid the money. They have, however, great difficulty with the idea of goblin-made objects passing from wizard to wizard. You saw Griphook's face when the tiara passed under his eyes. He disapproves. I believe he thinks, as do the fiercest of his kind, that it ought to have been returned to the goblins once the original purchaser died. They consider our habit of keeping goblin-made objects, passing them from wizard to wizard without further payment, little more than theft."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“——妖精们会认为那是付钱者租用的。他们最难接受的，就是妖精制作的东西由巫师传给巫师。当头饰在拉环眼皮下传过来，你看到他的脸色。他很不满。我相信拉环会像他同类中的极端者一样，认为原来的购买者死后，那东西就应该归还给妖精。他们认为我们这样习惯于占有妖精制造的东西，由巫师传给巫师而不再付钱，比偷窃好不到哪里去。”">查看中文翻译</div>
