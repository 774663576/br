<div class="line_en">But the air was sharp and cold and full of fear. Even Summer was afraid. The fur on his neck was bristling. Shadows stretched against the hillside, black and hungry. All the trees were bowed and twisted by the weight of ice they carried. Some hardly looked like trees at all. Buried from root to crown in frozen snow, they huddled on the hill like giants, monstrous and misshapen creatures hunched against the icy wind.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Wolves are the least of our woes," said Coldhands. "We have to climb. It will be dark soon. You would do well to be inside before night comes. Your warmth will draw them."

<div class="line_cn" title="“那些狼在我们面临的危险中最无关紧要。”冷手说。“我们必须向上爬。这里马上就要黑下来了。你们最好在夜色降临之前钻到里面去。你们的体温会吸引他们。”他朝西打量了一下，透过树林可以看到昏暗的落日余晖，仿佛遥远的一处火堆的光亮。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">No, thought Bran, but all those yards are upward. The hill was steep and thickly wooded. The snow had stopped three days ago, but none of it had melted. Beneath the trees, the ground was blanketed in white, still pristine and unbroken. "No one's here," said Bran, bravely. "Look at the snow. There are no footprints."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没有那么远，布兰想，但那全是上坡路。那座山坡陡峭而且长满了灌木。雪三天前就停了，但一直没有融化。那些树下面的地上铺着厚厚的白雪，上面没有任何踩动过的痕迹。“那边没人，”布兰鼓足勇气说。“看看那些雪。那里没有足迹。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Hodor." Hodor clapped his hands together. "Jojen just needs to eat," Bran said, miserably. It had been twelve days since the elk had collapsed for the third and final time, since Coldhands had knelt beside it in the snowbank and murmured a blessing in some strange tongue as he slit its throat. Bran wept like a little girl when the bright blood came rushing out. He had never felt more like a cripple than he did then, watching helplessly as Meera Reed and Coldhands butchered the brave beast who had carried them so far. He told himself he would not eat, that it was better to go hungry than to feast upon a friend, but in the end he'd eaten twice, once in his own skin and once in Summer's. As gaunt and starved as the elk had been, the steaks the ranger carved from him had sustained them for seven days, until they finished the last of them huddled over a fire in the ruins of an old hillfort.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“阿多。”阿多拍了一下手。“玖健只是需要进食了，”布兰不安地说。从那只麋鹿跌倒三次，最终没能在站起来时，已经过去十二天了，冷手跪在它旁边的雪堆中，在割开它的喉咙时用一种陌生的语言低声祈祷。当鲜血喷涌而出时，布兰像个小女孩一样哭起来。他从未像在那一刻深深地感受到自己像个残废，当梅拉·黎德和冷手动手屠宰那只驮着他们走了那么远的英勇的牲畜时，他只能无助地观望着。他告诉自己不去动那些肉，忍饥挨饿也要好过享用自己的朋友，但最终他还是吃了两次，一次是自己，一次是在夏天躯体里。那只麋鹿已经变得十分憔悴消瘦，游骑兵从它身上割下的肉排还是支撑了他们七天，直到在一个旧石堡中的火堆上他们烤食了最后一块。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You go." Meera Reed bent down beside her brother. He was settled in the bole of an oak, eyes closed, shivering violently. What little of his face could be seen beneath his hood and scarf was as colorless as the surrounding snow, but breath still puffed faintly from his nostrils whenever he exhaled. Meera had been carrying him all day. Food and fire will set him right again, Bran tried to tell himself, though he wasn't sure it would. "I can't fight and carry Jojen both, the climb's too steep," Meera was saying. "Hodor, you take Bran up to that cave."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你们走吧。”梅拉·黎德在她的弟弟身旁弯下了腰。他拄着一根橡树枝，双眼紧闭，像落叶般不停地颤抖着。他兜帽和围巾之下小小的面孔毫无血色，就像周围的积雪一样苍白，但当他呼气时，依旧从鼻孔中微弱地喷出热气。梅拉已经背了他整整一天。进食和烤烤火会让他重新振作起来，布兰试图说服自己，但他不确信是否果真如此。“我没法背着他爬上去，山坡太陡了。”梅拉说道。“阿多，你带布兰去那个山洞吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Wordless for once, Hodor slapped the snow off his legs, and plowed upward through the snowdrifts with Bran upon his back. Coldhands stalked beside them, his blade in a black hand. Summer came after. In some places the snow was higher than he was, and the big direwolf had to stop and shake it off after plunging through the thin crust. As they climbed, Bran turned awkwardly in his basket to watch as Meera slid an arm beneath her brother to lift him to his feet. He's too heavy for her. She's half-starved, she's not as strong as she was. She clutched her frog spear in her other hand, jabbing the tines into the snow for a little more support. Meera had just begun to struggle up the hill, half-dragging and half-carrying her little brother, when Hodor passed between two trees, and Bran lost sight of them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="默不作声，阿多拍打掉腿上的积雪，背着布兰趟过雪堆向上走去。冷手尾随在他们身后，漆黑的手中握着他的剑。夏天跟着过来了。有些地方的积雪要没过它，每当那只大冰原狼在踩穿薄薄的冰壳，跌进雪中之后，就不得不停下来抖落身上的积雪。在他们攀登的时候，布兰在他的篮子中费力地扭身过去看着梅拉，她一只手搀扶着他的弟弟。他对她来讲太沉了。她半饥半饱，也没有原来的力气了。她用另外一只手拄着她的捕蛙矛，把矛尖插进雪里支撑着。梅拉开始挣扎着向山坡上爬去，半拖半背着她的弟弟，当阿多从两棵树中间穿过时，布兰望不见他们了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Summer stopped suddenly, at the bottom of a steep stretch of unbroken white snow. The direwolf turned his head, sniffed the air, then snarled. Fur bristling, he began to back away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在一块未被踩动过的白雪堆积而成的陡坡脚下，夏天突然停了下来。那只冰原狼扭过头，在空气中嗅着，然后咆哮起来。它的毛全都竖立起来，它开始掉头向后跑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Coldhands was still climbing, and Hodor wanted to keep up. "Hodor, hodor, hodor," he grumbled loudly, to drown out Bran's complaints. His breathing had grown labored. Pale mist filled the air. He took a step, then another. The snow was almost waist deep and the slope was very steep. Hodor was leaning forward, grasping at rocks and trees with his hands as he climbed. Another step. Another. The snow Hodor disturbed slid downhill, starting a small avalanche behind them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="冷手仍在攀登，阿多也想要跟上。“阿多，阿多，阿多，”他大声地抱怨着，压过了布兰的抗议声。他的呼吸变得困难。空气中充满了白色的薄雾。他迈出一步，接着又一步。雪几乎有齐腰深，斜坡非常陡峭。阿多向前倾斜着身子，双手扒着岩石和树干攀登着。又是一步，再一步。阿多扰动的积雪滑下了山坡，在身后形成了一场小小的雪崩。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Hodor, stop," said Bran. "Hodor. Wait." Something was wrong. Summer smelled it, and so did he. Something bad. Something close. "Hodor, no, go back."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“阿多，停下。”布兰说。“阿多，等等。”这有点不对劲。夏天闻出来，他也就闻出来了。有不好的东西。有东西在附近。“阿多，不，后退。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The hill grew steeper. Drifts of snow cracked under Hodor's boots. Once a rock moved beneath his foot and he slid backwards, and almost went tumbling back down the hill. The ranger caught him by the arm and saved him. "Hodor," said Hodor. Every gust of wind filled the air with fine white powder that shone like glass in the last light of day. Ravens flapped around them. One flew ahead and vanished inside the cave. Only eighty yards now, Bran thought, that's not far at all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山坡变得更加陡峭了。冰碛在阿多的靴下崩碎。有一次他脚下的一块岩石松动了，他向后仰了过去，险些要翻滚下去。游骑兵伸手抓住了他，挽救了他们。“阿多，“阿多说。每阵狂风都会把白白的细雪卷到空中，在晚霞的映射下像玻璃一样闪光。乌鸦绕着他们拍打着翅膀。一只向前飞去，消失在了山洞中。现在还剩下八十码了，布兰想，这根本不算远。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Hodor kicked at it, slamming a snow-covered heel full into the thing's face, but the dead man did not even seem to feel it. Then the two of them were grappling, punching and clawing at each other, sliding down the hill. Snow filled Bran's mouth and nose as they rolled over, but in a half a heartbeat he was rolling up again. Something slammed against his head, a rock or a chunk of ice or a dead man's fist, he could not tell, and he found himself out of his basket, sprawled across the hillside, spitting snow, his gloved hand full of hair that he'd torn from Hodor's head.</div>

<div class="line_en">But suddenly Summer was between them. Bran glimpsed skin tear like cheap cloth, heard the splintering of bone. He saw a hand and wrist rip loose, pale fingers wriggling, the sleeve faded black roughspun. Black, he thought, he's wearing black, he was one of the Watch. Summer flung the arm aside, twisted, and sank his teeth into the dead man's neck under the chin.

<div class="line_en">And suddenly he was not Bran, the broken boy crawling through the snow, suddenly he was Hodor halfway down the hill, with the wight raking at his eyes. Roaring, he came lurching to his feet, throwing the thing violently aside. It went to one knee, began to rise again. Bran ripped Hodor's longsword from his belt. Deep inside he could hear poor Hodor whimpering still, but outside he was seven feet of fury with old iron in his hand. He raised the sword and brought it down upon the dead man, grunting as the blade sheared through wet wool and rusted mail and rotted leather, biting deep into the bones and flesh beneath. "HODOR!" he bellowed, and slashed again. This time he took the wight's head off at the neck, and for half a moment he exulted… until a pair of dead hands came groping blindly for his throat.</div>

A cloud of ravens was pouring from the cave, and he saw a little girl with a torch in hand, darting this way and that. For a moment Bran thought it was his sister Arya… madly, for he knew his little sister was a thousand leagues away, or dead.

But there were other bones as well, big ones that must have come from giants and small ones that could have been from children.

<div class="line_cn" title="在他们面前出现的是一位身着乌木装饰皮肤白皙的君主，宛如梦幻般地坐在纠缠成一团的树根当中，鱼梁木缠绕而成的宝座环绕着他枯瘦的躯体就像一位母亲搂抱着她的孩子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His body was so skeletal and his clothes so rotted that at first Bran took him for another corpse, a dead man propped up so long that the roots had grown over him, under him, and through him. What skin the corpse lord showed was white, save for a bloody blotch that crept up his neck onto his cheek. His white hair was fine and thin as root hair and long enough to brush against the earthen floor. Roots coiled around his legs like wooden serpents. One burrowed through his breeches into the desiccated flesh of his thigh, to emerge again from his shoulder. A spray of dark red leaves sprouted from his skull, and grey mushrooms spotted his brow. A little skin remained, stretched across his face, tight and hard as white leather, but even that was fraying, and here and there the brown and yellow bone beneath was poking through.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的躯体如此枯瘦而且他的衣服如此破烂，以至于布兰最初以为把他当成了又一具尸体，一具支撑了太久的尸鬼以至于树根缠绕住了他，把他包裹起来了。除了从脖子延伸到脸颊上那块血红色的斑痕，这位骸骨之主的皮肤是如此的白皙。他的白发像根须一样精致而纤细，长长的一直拖到了地上。缠绕在他大腿上卷曲的树根像是木头刻成的蛇。有一支树根从他裤子上的破洞钻进了他大腿上干枯的血肉中，从他的肩膀冒了出来。一簇深红色的叶子从他的头骨中探了出来，额头上散落生长着灰色的蘑菇。还有一小块皮肤残留着，绷在他的脸上，紧绷绷和坚硬的就像块白色的皮革，但就是那也在崩裂，到处都有褐色和黄色的骨头从下面撑出来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Are you the three-eyed crow?" Bran heard himself say. A three-eyed crow should have three eyes. He has only one, and that one red. Bran could feel the eye staring at him, shining like a pool of blood in the torchlight. Where his other eye should have been, a thin white root grew from an empty socket, down his cheek, and into his neck.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“您是三眼乌鸦吗？”布兰听见自己开口说话。三眼乌鸦应该有三只眼睛。他只有一只，而且还是红色的。布兰能感觉得到那只眼睛正打量着他，在火光的映射下就像血色的湖泊一样闪闪发光。他的另一只眼睛哪去了，一根细细的树根从空空的眼眶中伸展出来，挂在他的脸颊上，插到他的脖子中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"A… crow?" The pale lord's voice was dry. His lips moved slowly, as if they had forgotten how to form words. "Once, aye. Black of garb and black of blood." The clothes he wore were rotten and faded, spotted with moss and eaten through with worms, but once they had been black. "I have been many things, Bran. Now I am as you see me, and now you will understand why I could not come to you… except in dreams. I have watched you for a long time, watched you with a thousand eyes and one. I saw your birth, and that of your lord father before you. I saw your first step, heard your first word, was part of your first dream. I was watching when you fell. And now you are come to me at last, Brandon Stark, though the hour is late."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“乌…鸦”那个白皙的君主嗓音干涩。他的嘴唇张得很慢，仿佛它们已经忘记怎么吐出一个词来了。“曾经是，对的。黑色的打扮，黑色的血。”他穿着的衣服已经腐烂脱落了，布满了霉斑和虫蛀，那它们曾经是黑色的。“我曾有很多化身，布兰。但现在我就是你看到的这幅样子，现在你该清楚为什么我不能去找你了吧…除非是在梦里。我观察了你很久，时刻都在观察着你。我看见了你的降生，还有在你之前你父亲大人的降生。我看到了你迈出的第一步，听见了你说出的第一句话，投身进你所做的第一个梦中。当你跌落时我正在一旁观望。现在你终于来找我了，布兰登·史塔克，尽管来的有些迟。”">查看中文翻译</div>
