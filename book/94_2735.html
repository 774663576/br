<div class="line_en">She has three scratch marks on her cheek. As if from claws. She knows they'll want to know how it all began. Elsa ran, is the short answer. She's good at running. That's what happens when you get chased all the time.</div>

<div class="line_en">At lunchtime, Elsa took the bus home, because she figured she had a better chance of dodging Britt-Marie during the day. She stopped and bought four bags of Daim in the supermarket. The house was as dark and silent as only Granny's house could be without the presence of Granny, and it felt as if even the house were missing her. Elsa hid carefully from Britt-Marie, who was on her way to the space where the trash bins are kept, although she didn't even have any bags of separated rubbish. After Britt-Marie had checked the contents of all the bins and pursed her mouth the way she does when she decides to raise some issue at the next residents' meeting, she set off down the street to the supermarket so she could walk about and purse her mouth in there for a while. Elsa sneaked in and went up the stairs to the mezzanine floor. There she stood, shaking with fear and anger outside the flat, still with the letter in her hand. Her anger was reserved for Granny. Her fear was of The Monster.</div>

<div class="line_en">This morning she lied to Mum about starting school an hour earlier than usual. And when Mum pulled her up on it, Elsa played the bad mother card. The bad mother card is like Renault: hardly a beauty but surprisingly effective. "I've told you like a hundred times I start earlier on Mondays! I even gave you a slip but you never listen to me anymore!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这天早上，她骗妈妈说学校比平时提早一个小时上课。妈妈责怪她为什么不早说时，爱莎就用了“坏母亲”那招。“坏母亲”这个招数就像是雷诺，不怎么漂亮但屡试不爽。“我告诉过你一百次了，周一我要早去！我甚至给你留了一张字条，但你从来都不听我说的话。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="没过多久，她奔跑着穿过操场，跑得太快以至于觉得脚底快要起火了。此刻，她坐在一个小房间里，脸颊上带着明显的红色抓痕，等妈妈赶来，心里很清楚她会询问发生了什么事。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was smart of Granny, Elsa has to admit it. She's still insanely irritated about this stupid treasure hunt, but it was smart of Granny to write "Miamas" in normal characters in the letter. Because Elsa had stood there earlier on the landing, summoning her courage for at least a hundred eternities before she rang the doorbell. And if Granny hadn't known that Elsa would read the letter even though one mustn't read other people's letters, and if she hadn't written "Miamas" in normal characters, Elsa would just have thrown the envelope in The Monster's mail slot and run away. Instead, she stood there ringing the doorbell, because she had to press The Monster for some answers.</div>

<div class="line_en">Our Friend was still howling in the flat next door, but nothing happened when she rang at The Monster's door. She rang again and banged on the door until the wood was creaking and then peered inside through the mail slot, but it was too dark to see anything. Not a movement. Not a breath. All she could feel was an acrid smell of cleaning agents, the sort of smell that rushes up your nasal membranes and starts kicking the back of your eyeballs when you breathe it in.</div>

<div class="line_en">And then she put the letter in her backpack and took the bus back to school. And when she looked out of the bus window she thought she saw him again. The thin man who'd been standing outside the undertaker's yesterday while Mum was talking to the whale-woman. Now he was in the shadows on the other side of the street. She couldn't see his face behind the cigarette smoke, but a cold, instinctual terror wrapped itself around her ribs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后她把信放进背包，乘公交车回学校了。当她从车窗望出去时，她觉得自己又看见那个人了——昨天妈妈和鲸鱼女士说话时，站在殡仪馆外面的瘦削男人。此时他站在街对面的阴影中。香烟的烟雾让她看不清他的脸，但一种冰冷、本能的恐惧涌上了她的心头。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Elsa reckons this may have been why she couldn't make herself invisible when she got to school. Invisibility is the sort of superpower you can train yourself to have, and Elsa practices it all the time, but it doesn't work if you are angry or frightened. When she got to school Elsa was both. Afraid of men turning up in the shadows without her knowing why, and angry at Granny for sending a letter to a monster, and both angry at and afraid of monsters. Normal monsters have the decency to live deep inside black caves or at the bottoms of ice-cold lakes. Normal, terrifying monsters don't actually live in flats and get their mail delivered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱莎猜想，这大概就是回到学校时，她无法隐身的原因。隐身是一种可以通过训练获得的超能力，爱莎一直在练习，但生气和害怕时就不管用了，而此时恰恰二者兼有。她不知道为什么会对阴影里的男人感到恐惧，而外婆要她给怪物送信这件事则让爱莎一肚子不满，怪物本身也让人又怕又气。通常，怪物应该自觉地住在黑暗的洞穴深处或者冰冷的湖底。可怕的怪物不会真的住在公寓里，还让人给它们送信。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And anyway Elsa hates Monday. School is always at its worst on Monday mornings, because people who like chasing you have had to hang about all weekend with no one to chase. The notes in her locker are always the worst on Mondays. Which could also be why the invisibility thing is not working.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="还有，爱莎痛恨星期一。星期一早上的学校是最糟糕的，因为那些喜欢追赶你的人憋了整个周末无人可追。星期一，爱莎储物柜里的字条也是最刻薄的。这或许是隐身能力不管用的另一个原因。">查看中文翻译</div>

Deep inside, she's hoping Granny will come storming in at any moment with her fists raised, like in a boxing match in an old film.

The headmaster had turned to Elsa's father and said: "There's an element of a typical boyish prank about this…" And then he had to devote quite a long time to explaining to Granny what a typical girlish prank might be, because Granny really wanted to know.</div>

<div class="line_en">"It's not bloody cowardly to hit girls!" she had roared at the headmaster. "This kid isn't a little asswipe for hitting a girl, he's an asswipe for hitting anyone!" And then the boy's father got upset and started being rude to Granny for calling his son an asswipe, and then Granny had replied that she was going to teach Elsa how to "kick boys in the fuse box" and then they'd see "how much bloody fun it is fighting with girls!" And then the headmaster had asked everyone to compose themselves a little. And then they all tried that for a bit. But then the headmaster wanted the boy and Elsa to shake hands and apologize to each other, and then Granny sprang out of her chair asking, "Why the hell should Elsa apologize?" The headmaster said that Elsa must take her share of the guilt because she had "provoked" the boy and one had to understand that the boy had experienced difficulties in "controlling himself." And that was when Granny had tried to throw the globe at the headmaster, but Mum managed to catch hold of Granny's arm at the very last moment, so that the globe ended up hitting the headmaster's computer instead and smashing the screen. "I WAS PROVOKED!" Granny had roared at the headmaster while Mum tried to drag her into the corridor, "I COULDN'T CONTROL MYSELF!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不是因为打女孩才是该死的懦夫！”她冲着校长咆哮，“这小子不是因为打了女孩才是个小混蛋，是因为打了人，任何人！”然后，那男孩的父亲生气了，开始对外婆恶语相加，指责她骂他儿子是混蛋。而外婆则回应说，她要教爱莎怎么“踢男孩的要害”，那么他们就能体验一下“和女孩打架有多他妈爽了”。接着校长叫所有人都冷静一点儿。大家配合了一下。但当校长希望那男孩和爱莎握手并相互道歉时，外婆从椅子上跳了起来说：“凭什么要爱莎道歉？”校长回答说，爱莎也有错，因为她“惹了”那个男孩，那男孩有“自控力”问题，大家要体谅他。那一刻，外婆差点儿抄起地球仪向校长砸去，但妈妈在最后一刻拉住了外婆的胳膊，于是地球仪只砸到了校长的电脑，砸碎了屏幕。“我！被！惹！到！了！”外婆向着校长怒吼，妈妈则努力想把她拉到走廊去，“我！不！能！控！制！我！自！己！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">During the last lesson before lunch, one of their smarmy teachers told them their assignment over the Christmas holiday would be to prepare a talk on the theme of A Literary Hero I Look Up To. And they were to dress up as their hero and talk about the hero in the first person singular. Everyone had to put up their hands and choose a hero. Elsa was going to go for Harry Potter, but someone else got him first. So when her turn came she said Spider-Man. And then one of the boys behind her got annoyed because he was going for that. And then there was an argument. "You can't take Spider-Man!" shouted the boy. And Elsa said, "Pity, because I just did!" And then the boy said, "It's a pity for YOU, yeah!" And then Elsa snorted in English. "Sure!" Because that is Elsa's favorite word in English. And then the boy shouted that Elsa couldn't be Spider-Man because "only boys can be Spider-Man!" And then Elsa told him he could be Spider-Man's girlfriend. And then he pushed Elsa into a radiator. And then Elsa hit him with a book.</div>
