<div class="line_en">I stare down at my shoes, watching as a fine layer of ash settles on the worn leather. This is where the bed I shared with my sister, Prim, stood. Over there was the kitchen table. The bricks of the chimney, which collapsed in a charred heap, provide a point of reference for the rest of the house. How else could I orient myself in this sea of gray?</div>

<div class="line_en">Almost nothing remains of District 12. A month ago, the Capitol's firebombs obliterated the poor coal miners' houses in the Seam, the shops in the town, even the Justice Building. The only area that escaped incineration was the Victor's Village. I don't know why exactly. Perhaps so anyone forced to come here on Capitol business would have somewhere decent to stay.

The memories swirl as I try to sort out what is true and what is false. What series of events led me to be standing in the ruins of my city? This is hard because the effects of the concussion she gave me haven't completely subsided and my thoughts still have a tendency to jumble together. Also, the drugs they use to control my pain and mood sometimes make me see things. I guess.

<div class="line_en">"Katniss. Should I come down?" My best friend Gale's voice reaches me through the headset the rebels insisted I wear. He's up in a hovercraft, watching me carefully, ready to swoop in if anything goes amiss. I realize I'm crouched down now, elbows on my thighs, my head braced between my hands. I must look on the verge of some kind of breakdown. This won't do. Not when they're finally weaning me off the medication.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“凯特尼斯。要我下来吗？”耳边传来了我最好的朋友盖尔的声音，十三区的反抗者坚持让我戴耳麦，这声音是从那里传来的。他现在正坐在飞机里，正密切关注着我的一举一动，万一有情况他会立刻下来。这时我才意识到自己已经蹲了下来，胳膊肘支在大腿上，双手紧抱着头。我的样子看上去肯定像要崩溃了。不行，不能在快给我断药的时候让他们看见我这样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I straighten up and wave his offer away. "No. I'm fine." To reinforce this, I begin to move away from my old house and in toward the town. Gale asked to be dropped off in 12 with me, but he didn't force the issue when I refused his company. He understands I don't want anyone with me today. Not even him. Some walks you have to take alone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我站起身，向他挥挥手，示意我没事。“不，我很好。”为厂使对方确信我没事，我离开自己旧家的位置，朝城里走去。盖尔曾要求跟我一起来，但我拒绝了，他也没再坚持。他明白，今天我不想让任何人陪着，甚至是他。这事只能由我一个人来做。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The summer's been scorching hot and dry as a bone. There's been next to no rain to disturb the piles of ash left by the attack. They shift here and there, in reaction to my footsteps. No breeze to scatter them. I keep my eyes on what I remember as the road, because when I first landed in the Meadow, I wasn't careful and I walked right into a rock. Only it wasn't a rock -- it was someone's skull. It rolled over and over and landed faceup, and for a long time I couldn't stop looking at the teeth, wondering whose they were, thinking of how mine would probably look the same way under similar circumstances.</div>

<div class="line_en">I stick to the road out of habit, but it's a bad choice, because it's full of the remains of those who tried to flee. Some were incinerated entirely. But others, probably overcome with smoke, escaped the worst of the flames and now lie reeking in various states of decomposition, carrion for scavengers, blanketed by flies. I killed you, I think as I pass a pile. And you. And you.</div>

Still, I can never get around the fact that District 13 was instrumental in 12's destruction. This doesn't absolve me of blame -- there's plenty of blame to go around. But without them, I would not have been part of a larger plot to overthrow the Capitol or had the wherewithal to do it.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was Gale who thought of the Meadow, one of the few places not filled with old wooden homes embedded with coal dust. He herded those he could in its direction, including my mother and Prim. He formed the team that pulled down the fence -- now just a harmless chain-link barrier, with the electricity off -- and led the people into the woods. He took them to the only place he could think of, the lake my father had shown me as a child. And it was from there they watched the distant flames eat up everything they knew in the world.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="是盖尔首先想到了“牧场”，在十二区，只有包括“牧场”在内的少数几个地方没有被煤尘满布的木头房子挤满。他尽可能招呼大家朝那个方向跑，妈妈和波丽姆也在。他领着大家穿过隔离网——这个时候隔离网已断电，它不过是一道没有危险的铁丝网——来到林子里，把他们带到他所知道的唯一的藏身之所，就是我小时候爸爸带我去的那个湖边。也就是在那里，他们眼睁睁地看着远处的大火把他们熟悉的一切吞噬。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">By dawn the bombers were long gone, the fires dying, the final stragglers rounded up. My mother and Prim had set up a medical area for the injured and were attempting to treat them with whatever they could glean from the woods. Gale had two sets of bows and arrows, one hunting knife, one fishing net, and over eight hundred terrified people to feed. With the help of those who were able-bodied, they managed for three days. And that's when the hovercraft unexpectedly arrived to evacuate them to District 13, where there were more than enough clean, white living compartments, plenty of clothing, and three meals a day. The compartments had the disadvantage of being underground, the clothing was identical, and the food was relatively tasteless, but for the refugees of 12, these were minor considerations. They were safe. They were being cared for. They were alive and eagerly welcomed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到了拂晓，直升机早已离去，火势也不那么凶猛了，最后的一些幸存者也聚集到这里。妈妈和波丽姆设了一个临时医护点，用她们在林子找到的一切尽力为受伤的人处理伤口。共有八百多人逃了出来，他们惊魂未定，惶恐不安。盖尔找到了两把弓箭，一把打猎刀，一张渔网，靠这些工具，他尽量给八百多惊恐的人们弄到吃的。一些还能动的人也来帮忙，大家勉强挨了三天。意想不到的是，在这艰难的时刻，十三区的直升机出现了，把他们撤离到十三区。十三区有干净洁白的住处、充足的衣物和一日三餐。虽然他们居住在地下、衣服式样单一、食物味道也并不太好，但对于十二区的人们来说，这算不上什么，重要的是他们安全了，活了下来，得到关照，还受到热情的欢迎。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This enthusiasm was interpreted as kindness. But a man named Dalton, a District 10 refugee who'd made it to 13 on foot a few years ago, leaked the real motive to me. "They need you. Me. They need us all. Awhile back, there was some sort of pox epidemic that killed a bunch of them and left a lot more infertile. New breeding stock. That's how they see us." Back in 10, he'd worked on one of the beef ranches, maintaining the genetic diversity of the herd with the implantation of long-frozen cow embryos. He's very likely right about 13, because there don't seem to be nearly enough kids around. But so what? We're not being kept in pens, we're being trained for work, the children are being educated. Those over fourteen have been given entry-level ranks in the military and are addressed respectfully as "Soldier." Every single refugee was granted automatic citizenship by the authorities of 13.</div>

<div class="line_en">What they want is for me to truly take on the role they designed for me. The symbol of the revolution. The Mockingjay. It isn't enough, what I've done in the past, defying the Capitol in the Games, providing a rallying point. I must now become the actual leader, the face, the voice, the embodiment of the revolution. The person who the districts -- most of which are now openly at war with the Capitol -- can count on to blaze the path to victory. I won't have to do it alone. They have a whole team of people to make me over, dress me, write my speeches, orchestrate my appearances -- as if that doesn't sound horribly familiar -- and all I have to do is play my part. Sometimes I listen to them and sometimes I just watch the perfect line of Coin's hair and try to decide if it's a wig. Eventually, I leave the room because my head starts to ache or it's time to eat or if I don't get aboveground I might start screaming. I don't bother to say anything. I simply get up and walk out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们希望我成为象征反叛的嘲笑鸟，那是早已为我设计好的角色。这还不够，我曾在饥饿游戏中蔑视凯匹特、曾经几乎让所有的“贡品”联合起来，鉴于我过去所做的一切，他们希望我现在成为真正的领袖。我的面孔、我的声音都将成为革命的象征，我必须成为各区反抗者的领头人——大多数辖区现在已公开反抗凯匹特——我要成为他们可信任的人，一路带领他们走向胜利。我并非孤独一人，整个一个团队会帮扶我，给我设计服装、写讲演稿、为我公开露面进行策划——好像这套做法我还不够熟悉——我所要做的一切就是扮演好自已的角色。有时我会认真听他们说话，有时我只观察科恩完美的头发，琢磨着那究竟是不是假发。最终，一切以我的离去而告终，原因是我又开始头疼，或者到了吃饭时间，或者因为我在地下室太憋得慌，又想大声叫喊。我不需要多说什么，只是站起身，走出去就是了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And who did they fish out of the arena instead? Me, who won't cooperate. Beetee, an older inventor from 3, who I rarely see because he was pulled into weapons development the minute he could sit upright. Literally, they wheeled his hospital bed into some top secret area and now he only occasionally shows up for meals. He's very smart and very willing to help the cause, but not really firebrand material. Then there's Finnick Odair, the sex symbol from the fishing district, who kept Peeta alive in the arena when I couldn't. They want to transform Finnick into a rebel leader as well, but first they'll have to get him to stay awake for more than five minutes. Even when he is conscious, you have to say everything to him three times to get through to his brain. The doctors say it's from the electrical shock he received in the arena, but I know it's a lot more complicated than that. I know that Finnick can't focus on anything in 13 because he's trying so hard to see what's happening in the Capitol to Annie, the mad girl from his district who's the only person on earth he loves.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可事实上从竞技场救出来的人是谁呢？我，一个不合作的人。比特，三区的一个老发明者。我几乎没再见到他，因为他身体刚有所恢复，仅仅能坐起来，就被拽去参加武器改良工作了。事实上，是他们把他的病床推到高级机密区域的，现在，只是在吃饭时偶尔会碰到他。他聪明异常，并且非常乐意参加到这项事业中去，可他并不是一块组织反抗运动的料子。被救出来的人还有芬尼克·奥迪尔，从渔业为主的三区来的性感偶像，在竞技场我没能救皮塔时，是他救了皮塔一命。十三区当局也曾试图将芬尼克改造成一个反抗领袖，可他们首先要让他意识清醒的时间超过五分钟。即使在他意识清醒的时候，人们也需要把话重复三遍，才能让他最终明白。医生说，那是因为他在竞技场遭到电击，可我清楚事|青要比这复杂得多。芬尼克无法专注于十三区的任何事情，因为他一直挂记安妮，那个他在这世上唯一爱着的疯女孩，关注着凯匹特对她采取的一举一动。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I move through the downstairs on hunter's feet, reluctant to make any sound. I pick up a few remembrances: a photo of my parents on their wedding day, a blue hair ribbon for Prim, the family book of medicinal and edible plants. The book falls open to a page with yellow flowers and I shut it quickly because it was Peeta's brush that painted them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我像打猎时一样轻手轻脚地走下楼梯，不愿发出一点声音。我找到一些有纪念意义的物品：父母在结婚当天照的照片，波丽姆的一条蓝色发带，我家祖传的关于医药和可食用植物的书籍。这本书翻开着，在打开的那一页上面画着黄色的花朵。我赶快把它合上了，因为这花是皮塔画的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Is there any point in doing anything at all? My mother, my sister, and Gale's family are finally safe. As for the rest of 12, people are either dead, which is irreversible, or protected in 13. That leaves the rebels in the districts. Of course, I hate the Capitol, but I have no confidence that my being the Mockingjay will benefit those who are trying to bring it down. How can I help the districts when every time I make a move, it results in suffering and loss of life? The old man shot in District 11 for whistling. The crackdown in 12 after I intervened in Gale's whipping. My stylist, Cinna, being dragged, bloody and unconscious, from the Launch Room before the Games. Plutarch's sources believe he was killed during interrogation. Brilliant, enigmatic, lovely Cinna is dead because of me. I push the thought away because it's too impossibly painful to dwell on without losing my fragile hold on the situation entirely.</div>

I swear, now that my family and Gale's are out of harm's way, I could run away. Except for one unfinished piece of business. Peeta. If I knew for sure that he was dead, I could just disappear into the woods and never look back. But until I do, I'm stuck.</div>

<div class="line_en">I spin on my heel at the sound of a hiss. In the kitchen doorway, back arched, ears flattened, stands the ugliest tomcat in the world. "Buttercup," I say. Thousands of people are dead, but he has survived and even looks well fed. On what? He can get in and out of the house through a window we always left ajar in the pantry. He must have been eating field mice. I refuse to consider the alternative.</div>

<div class="line_en">I squat down and extend a hand. "Come here, boy." Not likely. He's angry at his abandonment. Besides, I'm not offering food, and my ability to provide scraps has always been my main redeeming quality to him. For a while, when we used to meet up at the old house because we both disliked this new one, we seemed to be bonding a little. That's clearly over. He blinks those unpleasant yellow eyes.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Want to see Prim?" I ask. Her name catches his attention. Besides his own, it's the only word that means anything to him. He gives a rusty meow and approaches me. I pick him up, stroking his fur, then go to the closet and dig out my game bag and unceremoniously stuff him in. There's no other way I'll be able to carry him on the hovercraft, and he means the world to my sister. Her goat, Lady, an animal of actual value, has unfortunately not made an appearance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“想见波丽姆吗？”我问。听到她的名字它立刻精神起来。除了它自己的名字，这三个字对它而言是这世上最有意义的字眼。它扯开沙哑的喉咙，喵了一声，然后走到我身边。我把它抱起来，抚弄着它的毛，一边走到橱柜旁找出我的猎物袋，胡乱把它塞了进去。要把它带上直升机，也没什么别的东西好拿它，而它对我的妹妹而言，是这世上最珍贵的东西。妹妹养的羊“夫人”倒是很有实用价值的动物，很不幸，它没有如现。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In my headset, I hear Gale's voice telling me we must go back. But the game bag has reminded me of one more thing that I want. I sling the strap of the bag over the back of a chair and dash up the steps to my bedroom. Inside the closet hangs my father's hunting jacket. Before the Quell, I brought it here from the old house, thinking its presence might be of comfort to my mother and sister when I was dead. Thank goodness, or it'd be ash now.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="耳机里传来盖尔的声音，告诉我，我们现在必须离开了。但猎物袋子使我想起了还有另外一件宝贵的东西要带走。我把袋子往椅背上一搭，快速上楼来到我的卧室。在衣橱里挂着爸爸打猎时穿的夹克。我在世纪极限赛之前把它从旧家拿到了这里，一iS，想，如果我过世了，这件夹克可能会给妈妈和妹妹一些安慰。谢天谢地，幸好我把它拿了过来，不然它早被烧成灰了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">My nose twitches. It's the smell. Cloying and artificial. A dab of white peeks out of a vase of dried flowers on my dresser. I approach it with cautious steps. There, all but obscured by its preserved cousins, is a fresh white rose. Perfect. Down to the last thorn and silken petal.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我耸起鼻子。啊，是一股味道，很呕人的人造香精的气味。我的目光不由得落到梳妆台的花瓶上，瓶里插着的一束花已经干枯，在干枯的花瓣中间隐隐显露出一点白色。我小心翼翼地走近它。原来如此，在一把干枯的花朵里，藏着一朵新鲜的白玫瑰。这是一朵完美无比的花朵，如缎面般柔软的花瓣，嫩绿的玫瑰花刺。">查看中文翻译</div>

Only to me.</div>
