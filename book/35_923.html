<div class="line_en">He knew his trees -- and this elm was just like Steffa. "Let him be carried off and left to rot in the forest." That was what the older boys always said about Steffa. "Isn't that what happens to old cripples unable to work?" But Edwin had seen Steffa for what he was: an ancient warrior, still secretly strong, and with an understanding that went beyond even that of the elders. Steffa, alone in the village, had once known battlefields -- it was the battlefields that had taken his legs -- and that was why, in turn, Steffa had been able to recognise Edwin for what he was. There were other boys stronger, who might amuse themselves pinning Edwin to the ground and beating him. But it was Edwin, not any of them, who possessed a warrior's soul.</div>

<div class="line_en">Never in his life had he seen his village from such a height and distance, and it amazed him. It was like an object he could pick up in his hand, and he flexed his fingers experimentally over the view in the afternoon haze. The old woman, who had watched his ascent with anxiety, was still at the foot of the tree, calling up to him to climb no further. But Edwin ignored her, for he knew trees better than anyone. When the warrior had ordered him to keep watch, he had selected the elm with care, knowing that for all its sickly appearance, it would possess its own subtle strength and welcome him. It commanded, moreover, the best view of the bridge, and of the mountain road leading up to it, and he could see clearly the three soldiers talking to the rider. The latter had now dismounted, and holding his restless horse by the bridle, was arguing fiercely with the soldiers.</div>

<div class="line_en">As a strong breeze swayed the tree, Edwin moved his grip to a different branch and tried again to recall the events of the morning. His aunt's face had become distorted out of all recognition. She had been shrieking a curse at him, but Elder Ivor had not let her finish, pushing her away from the doorway of the barn, blocking Edwin's view of her as he did so. His aunt had always been good to him, but if she now wanted to curse him, Edwin did not care. Not long ago she had tried to get Edwin to address her as "mother," but he had never done so. For he knew his real mother was travelling. His real mother would not shriek at him like that, and have to be dragged away by Elder Ivor. And this morning, in the barn, he had heard his real mother's voice.</div>

<div class="line_en">He knew the noises were stones striking the rickety walls, but he ignored them to concentrate on the wagon before him. How long ago had it last been used? Why did it stand so crookedly? If it was now of no use, why was it kept like this in the barn?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他知道，噪音是石头砸在薄板墙上发出来的，但他不予理会，注意力集中在面前的马车上。马车有多久没使用了？为什么歪歪倒倒地立在那里？如果没有用，为什么要保留在谷仓里呢？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="这时候，他听见了她的声音：一开始很难辨别，因为外面很吵闹，还有石头砸墙的声音，但后来慢慢清晰起来。“这算不了什么，埃德温，”她说，“这算不了什么。你可以轻松地承受。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Elder Ivor had pushed him inside, into the darkness, and the door had closed, taking away his aunt's twisted face -- and all those other faces. At first the wagon had appeared only as a looming black shape in the middle of the barn. Then gradually he had distinguished its outline, and when he had reached towards it, the wood had felt moist and rotten. Outside, the voices were shouting again, and then the cracking noises had come. They had started sporadically, then several had come at once, accompanied by a splintering sound, after which the barn had seemed slightly less dark.</div>

<div class="line_en">So he had followed her commands, keeping his hands on the upper edges of the wagon's boards, passing one hand over the other to maintain his momentum. How many times had he gone round like that? A hundred? Two hundred? He would keep seeing, in one corner, a mysterious mound of earth; in another corner, where a narrow line of sun fell across the floor of the barn, a dead crow on its side, feathers still intact. In the half-dark, these two sights -- the mound of earth and the dead crow -- had come around again and again. Once he had asked out loud, "Did my aunt really curse me?" but no reply had come, and he had wondered if his mother had gone away. But then her voice had returned, saying, "Do your duty, Edwin. You're the mule. Don't stop just yet. You control everything. If you stop, so will those noises. So why fear them?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是他听从她的命令，手放在马车挡板的上方，双手交替，以保持冲劲。他就这样转了多少圈？一百？两百？他不停地看到，一个角落里有一个神秘的土堆；另一个角落里，窄窄一线阳光落在谷仓的地板上，有一只死乌鸦侧身躺着，羽毛仍旧完好。在微弱的光亮中，这两个东西——土堆和死乌鸦——也一圈一圈地转。有一次，他大声问道：“我阿姨真的诅咒我了吗？”但没有回答，他想母亲是不是已经走了。可随后她的声音又回来了：“尽你的职责，埃德温。你是骡子。不要停。你控制着一切。如果你停下来，那些声音也会停。那为什么要害怕它们呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You were very young then, boy, perhaps too young to remember. Wolves, in broad daylight, three of them, walking calmly right into the village." Then Steffa's voice would fill with contempt. "And the village hid in fear. Some men were away in the fields, it's true. But there were plenty still here. They hid themselves in the threshing barn. Not just the women and the children but the men too. The wolves had strange eyes, they said. Best not to challenge them. So the wolves took all they wished. They slaughtered the hens. Feasted on the goats. And all the while, the village hid. Some in their houses. Most in the threshing barn. Cripple that I am, they left me where I was, sitting in the barrow, these broken legs poking out, beside the ditch outside Mistress Mindred's. The wolves trotted towards me. Come and eat me, I said, I'll not hide in a barn for a wolf. But they cared not for me and I watched them go right past, their fur as good as brushing these useless feet. They took all they wished, and only after they'd long departed did those brave men creep out of their hiding places. Three wolves in daylight, and not a man here to stand up to them."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“孩子啊，你那时候还很小，可能都不记得。狼大白天就来了，三只，若无其事地直接走进了村子。”这时斯特法的声音会充满鄙夷。“全村人都害怕得躲藏起来。有些男人在外面的地里，这是真的。但村里还有很多。他们躲在打谷的谷仓里。不光是妇女和孩子，男人们也躲起来了。他们说，那些狼有奇怪的眼睛。最好还是不要去惹它们。所以狼群想干什么就干什么。它们咬死了母鸡。吃掉了山羊。而这时候全村人都躲起来了。有些躲在自己家里。大多躲在谷仓里。我是个跛子，他们把我丢在原地，坐在手推车上，这双烂腿伸在外面，就在明德里德夫人家外面那条沟旁边。狼朝我走过来。来吃了我吧，我说，我可不会因为一头狼而躲进谷仓。但狼群没理会我，我看着它们从身旁走过，皮毛几乎都擦到了这双没用的腿。它们想干什么就干什么，它们走了很久，那些勇敢的男人才从躲藏的地方爬出来。大白天来了三头狼，这儿却没有一个男人敢站出来。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He had thought about Steffa's story as he had circled the wagon. "Are you still travelling, mother?" he had asked once more, and again had received no reply. His legs were growing weary, and he had grown heartily sick of seeing the mound of earth and the dead crow, when at last she had said:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="围着马车转圈的时候，他想到了斯特法的故事。“你还在路上吗，母亲？”他又问了一次，但同样没有回答。他的腿开始累了，而且他真的不愿意再看到那个土堆和那只死乌鸦，最后她终于说道：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But somehow he had found the strength, and once he was confident the warrior was on his way, Edwin had slowed his pace -- for even mules were driven more slowly towards the end of a day -- and noted with satisfaction the cracking noises were growing more sparse.

Then the barn door had opened and the warrior had been standing there against the dazzling sunshine.</div>

This had brought a large rectangle of sun into the barn, and when Edwin had glanced about himself, the wagon, so dominant in the dark, had looked pathetically dilapidated. Had Wistan called him "young comrade" straight away? Edwin was unsure, but he did remember the warrior leading him into that patch of light, lifting his shirt and scrutinising the wound. Wistan had then straightened, glanced carefully over his shoulder, and said in a low voice:</div>

<div class="line_en">Earlier, when they had been climbing the valleyside, and he had stopped to wait for the two elderly Britons, Edwin had tried to remember the circumstances around the wound. On that occasion, standing amidst the stubbled heather, tugging the reins of Wistan's mare, nothing had formed clearly in his mind. But now, in the branches of the elm, gazing at the tiny figures down on the bridge, Edwin found coming back to him the dank air and blackness; the high smell of the bearskin covering the little wooden cage; the feel of the tiny beetles falling onto his head and shoulders when the cage was jolted. He recalled adjusting his posture and gripping the shaky grid before him to avoid being tossed about as the cage dragged along the ground. Then everything had become still again, and he had waited for the bearskin to be removed, for the cold air to rush in around him, and to glimpse the night by the glow of the nearby fire. For this was what had happened twice already that night, and the repetition had removed the edge from his fear. He remembered more: the stink of the ogres, and the vicious little creature hurling itself at the rickety poles of the cage, obliging Edwin to push as far back as he could.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="早些时候，他们两人在爬山，埃德温停下来等候两位上了年纪的不列颠人时，曾努力回想与伤口有关的情况。当时他站在矮小的石楠丛里，拉着维斯坦那匹马的缰绳，脑子里没有清晰的印象。但是，现在埃德温在树上，看着桥上细小的人影，回想起了那潮湿的空气和那黑暗，回想起了小木笼子上盖的熊皮的强烈气味，以及笼子颠簸时小甲虫落在头上和肩上的感觉。他想起自己调整姿势，抓住面前摇摇晃晃的栅栏，以免笼子在地上拖的时候，自己被甩来甩去。然后一切又安静下来，他等着熊皮被拿开，等着新鲜的空气涌到他四周，等着借助火堆的光亮看一眼夜晚。这种情况当天晚上已经发生两次，因此他并不是特别害怕。他还记得其他事情：食人兽的臭味，还有那个邪恶的小东西往笼子松动的木柱上撞，迫使埃德温尽可能往后靠。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Although at the time these attacks seemed to go on forever, Edwin now supposed they had not lasted so long before the creature had been pulled back by its leash. Then the bearskin would thump over him, all would be blackness again, and he would have to grip the poles as the cage was dragged to another spot.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当时，小东西的攻击似乎没完没了，但现在埃德温觉得，实际上时间并不长，后来那个小东西就被用绳子拽走了。然后熊皮砰一声落下来，一切又漆黑一片，他又得抓住木柱，因为笼子被拖到另一个地方。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The creature had moved so quickly it had been hard to get a clear view of it. He had had the impression of something the size and shape of a cockerel, though with no beak or feathers. It attacked with teeth and claws, all the time letting out a shrill squawking. Edwin trusted the wooden poles against the teeth and the claws, but now and then, the little creature's tail would whip by accident against the cage and then everything seemed much more vulnerable. Thankfully the creature -- still in its infancy, Edwin supposed -- seemed oblivious of the power in its tail.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那个小东西动作很快，很难看清楚。他当时觉得，它形状和大小像个小公鸡，但没有喙和羽毛。它用牙齿和爪子攻击，而且一直发出粗哑尖锐的叫声。埃德温相信，木头柱子能够挡住牙齿和爪子，但那个小东西的尾巴不时会碰巧打到笼子上，那笼子就显得脆弱多了。幸好，这东西还小——埃德温猜测应该还处在幼年期——似乎并不知道它的尾巴有很大力量。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At that very moment the cage had begun to tremble, and Edwin had realised the entire front section, with its protective grid, was being drawn aside. Even as this realisation made him shrink back, the bearskin was pulled off and the ferocious creature flew at him. In his sitting position, his instinct was to raise his feet and kick out, but the creature was agile, and Edwin found himself beating it off with fists and arms. Once he thought the creature had got the better of him, and had for an instant closed his eyes, but then opened them again to see his opponent clawing the air as the leash dragged it back. It was one of the few times he had been permitted a good glimpse of the creature, and he saw that his earlier impression had not been inaccurate: it looked like a plucked chicken, though with the head of a serpent. It came for him again, and Edwin was once more beating it off the best he could. Then quite suddenly, the cage front was restored before him, and the bearskin plunged him back in blackness. And it had only been in the moments afterwards, contorted inside the little cage, that he had felt the tingling on his left side just beneath the ribs, and had felt the wet stickiness there.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那一刻，笼子开始颤抖，埃德温意识到，笼子整个前面的部分，包括防护栅栏，都被拉到了一边。这让他往回缩了缩，与此同时，熊皮被拉下来，那凶恶的东西冲他猛扑过来。他坐在那儿，本能地抬起脚踢出去，但那东西非常灵巧，埃德温只好用拳头和胳膊乱打。有一下子，他以为那东西已经抓住了自己，还瞬间闭上了眼睛，可等他再次睁开眼睛，却发现对手只在空气中乱抓，拴它的绳子正在往后拽。只有在类似的少数情况下，他才能清楚地看到那东西的模样，发现之前的印象还算准确：那东西看上去像一只被拔了毛的鸡，不过头长得像蛇。它又冲埃德温来了，他只好再次努力把它打开。接着，突然之间，笼子的前部又回到原位，熊皮又将他罩在黑暗之中。后来，他身体扭曲地挤在小笼子里，才感觉到左侧肋下疼痛，也感觉到那儿湿漉漉、黏糊糊的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then on that final occasion, the bearskin had not come off for a long time. He had waited, listening to the creature's squawks, sometimes far away, sometimes much closer, and the grumbling sounds the ogres made when talking to each other, and he had known that something different was about to happen. And it had been during those moments of dreadful anticipation that he had asked for a rescuer. He had made the request from the depths of his being, so it had been something almost like a prayer, and as soon as it had taken shape in his mind, he had felt certain it would be granted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后一次，熊皮很长时间都没有取下来。他等待着，听着那东西粗厉的叫声，有时候很远，有时候近得多，还有食人兽互相讲话时的咕哝声，他知道这次情况会不一样。正是在那焦虑等待的时刻，他请求有人拯救他。他是从灵魂深处提出这个请求的，因此几乎就等于祈祷，等这请求在他脑子里成形，他立即觉得能达成所愿。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Edwin adjusted again his foothold within the elm, and bringing down his right hand, touched gently his wound. There was no longer any depth to the pain. During the climb up the valleyside, the coarseness of his shirt had at times made him grimace, but when he was still, as he was now, he could hardly feel a thing. Even that morning in the barn, when the warrior had examined it in the doorway, it had seemed little more than a cluster of tiny punctures. The wound was superficial -- not as bad as many he had had before. And yet, because people believed it to be an ogre's bite, it had caused all this trouble. Had he faced the creature with even more determination, perhaps he could have avoided receiving any wound at all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃德温再次调整了一下他在树上的落脚点，右手伸下去轻轻摸了摸伤口。疼痛已经不厉害了。爬上来的时候，粗糙的衬衫有时候会摩擦伤口，痛得他直咧嘴，但如果像现在这样不动，伤口几乎没什么感觉。那天上午在谷仓里，武士在门口检查伤口时，那里看起来也不过是一簇细小的洞而已。伤口很浅——没他以前受过的很多次伤严重。然而，由于人们相信这是食人兽的咬痕，才引起了这么多麻烦。当时要是他更加坚定地面对那个东西，也许根本就不会受伤。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But he knew there was no shame in how he had faced his ordeal. He had never cried out in terror, or pleaded to the ogres for mercy. After the little creature's first lunges -- which had taken him by surprise -- Edwin had met it with head held up. In fact he had had the presence of mind to realise the creature was an infant, and that one could in all probability create fear in it, just as one might in an unruly dog. And so he had kept his eyes open and tried to stare it down. His real mother, he knew, would be particularly proud of him for this. Indeed, now that he thought about it, the venom had gone out of the creature's attacks soon after its opening forays, and it had been Edwin who had gained more and more control of the combat. He recalled again the creature clawing the air, and it seemed to him now likely it had not been displaying an eagerness to continue the fight, but simply panic at the choking leash. It was quite possible, in fact, the ogres had judged Edwin the victor of the encounter, and that was why proceedings had been brought to an end.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但他知道，面对考验，他并没有做出耻辱的事。他从没害怕得大声叫喊，也没有祈求食人兽发发慈悲。那个小东西开始冲过来的时候，他吓了一跳，但后来他都抬着头，与它对抗。实际上，他临危不乱、思路清晰，还能发现这个小东西处在幼年期，因此完全有可能让它感到害怕，就像我们可以让一条任性的狗心生畏惧一样。所以他一直睁着眼睛，努力瞪着它、吓退它。他知道，他真正的母亲会因为这件事而为他感到特别骄傲。没错，现在他想起来，那东西一开始的突袭结束之后，攻击就慢慢不怎么凶狠了，反而是埃德温渐渐控制着战斗。他再次回想那东西在空气中乱抓的情形，现在看来那似乎不是要继续战斗，而是被绳子勒住了喉咙，惊慌失措。实际上，食人兽很可能认为埃德温是打斗的胜利者，所以这个做法才被终止了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Edwin gazed down at them. They were now discussing something earnestly with the warrior. The old woman had given up trying to talk him down, and all three were now watching the soldiers on the bridge from behind the cover of two giant pines. From his own vantage point, Edwin could see the rider had remounted and was gesticulating into the air. Then the three soldiers appeared to move away from him, and the rider turned his horse and set off at a gallop away from the bridge, back down the mountain.</div>

<div class="line_en">Edwin had wondered earlier why the warrior had been so reluctant to stay on the main mountain road, insisting on the steep cut up the valleyside; now it was obvious he had wished to avoid riders such as the one they had just seen. But there now seemed no way to proceed with their journey without going down onto the road and crossing the bridge past the waterfall, and the soldiers were still there. Had Wistan been able to see from down where he was that the rider had departed? Edwin wanted to alert him to this development, but felt he should not shout from the tree in case the soldiers somehow caught the sound. He would have to climb down and tell Wistan. Perhaps, while there had been four potential opponents, the warrior had been hesitant about a confrontation, but now with only three at the bridge, he would consider the odds in his favour. Had it just been Edwin and the warrior, they would surely have gone down to face the soldiers long ago, but the presence of the elderly couple must have made Wistan cautious. No doubt Wistan had brought them along for a good reason, and they had so far been kind to Edwin, but they were frustrating companions all the same.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃德温之前想过，武士为什么不愿意一直走山间的主路，坚持要走山谷一侧陡峭的小道；现在原因很明显，他是希望避开骑马的人，比如他们刚刚看到的那位。但是，现在看来，他们要继续往前走，就必须到下面的路上，从桥上经过瀑布，而士兵们仍旧在那儿。维斯坦在下面，能看到骑马的人已经离开了吗？埃德温想告诉他这一情况，可又觉得不能在树上喊，以免士兵们听到动静。他必须从树上爬下来，去告诉维斯坦。之前有四个潜在对手，也许武士不太愿意正面冲突，现在桥上只有三个人了，他可能会认为形势对自己有利。如果只有埃德温和武士两个人，他们肯定很早就下去直接面对士兵了，维斯坦之所以小心，肯定是因为这对上了年纪的夫妇。维斯坦带着他们，肯定有充足的理由，而且他们对埃德温一直很和善，但作为旅行的同伴，他们还是让人丧气。">查看中文翻译</div>
