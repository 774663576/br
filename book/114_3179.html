<div class="line_en">I don't suppose you've forgotten Jim. You alone have shown interest in him, although you did not agree that he was in control of his fate. Well, you must judge for yourself now. Here is Jim's last message to the world -- a greyish piece of paper, on which he wrote simply, "An awful thing has happened", and then, "I must now at once…" Nothing more. I imagine he could not describe the true horror of what he saw. I can understand that. I also send you an old letter, which was found carefully put away in his desk. It is from his father, and Jim probably received it a few days before joining the Patna. The good old vicar writes four pages of fatherly advice and family news; the mother and daughters send all their love to their sailor son and brother. Jim never answered it, but he kept it lovingly all those years. Who knows what conversations his suffering soul had with those clear-eyed, ghostly figures, living their peaceful lives in that quiet corner of the world?</div>

It is a real adventure, romantic beyond the wildest dreams of his boyhood, but with an ending that seems in some way unavoidable. Something like this had to happen.

It is hard for me to believe that I shall never hear his voice again, or see his fresh, young, excited face.</div>

<div class="line_en">It all began with a man called Captain Brown, one of the most evil seamen in the Western Pacific. From Cape York to Eden Bay he was famous for cheating, robbing and murdering; he was a cruel, violent and proud man, with no idea of duty, conscience or honour. At this moment in his life he was also desperate, because he had not earned much from his recent adventures, and his men were hungry and tired. They had stolen a Spanish ship, and were sailing it across the Java Sea, towards the Indian Ocean, when suddenly Brown realized that Patusan would be a good place to get food and water. Perhaps he had heard of it, as a largish village up the river, or perhaps it was just a name on his map. Anyway, they left their ship at the mouth of the river, and took the ship's boat up to the trading-post. However, the headman of the fishing village at Batu Kring had managed to warn the Patusan people, who started firing their guns as soon as Brown's boat appeared. Brown angrily ordered his men to fire back; he had not been expecting a fight. He noticed the creek (which Jim had jumped over in his escape from the Rajah's men), and told his men to row into it. They landed, and climbed a small hill, which gave them a good view of the village and the Rajah's stockade. They cut down some trees to make their own stockade, and waited for the natives to attack, in the growing darkness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所有这一切是由一个布朗船长引起的，他是西太平洋最邪恶的水手之一。从约克角到伊登湾，他因诈骗、抢掠和杀人而臭名昭著；他是个残酷、暴力、傲慢的人，根本没有责任感、良知与荣誉感。当时，他好几次行动都没有捞到多少钱，他的人马又饿又累，他很绝望。他们偷了一艘西班牙船，当时正穿过爪哇海，驶向印度洋，这时布朗突然想到帕图桑可能是一个寻找食物和水的好地方。他可能听说这里是河边一个比较大的村庄，也许他只是在地图上看到过这个名字。总之，他们把船停在河口，驾小船沿河而上到了贸易站。但巴都克灵渔村的头领向帕图桑的人报了信，布朗的船一出现，村民就开始射击。布朗愤怒地命令他的人开枪回击；他没料到会有冲突。他注意到那条小河（就是吉姆逃脱王公的手下追捕时跳过去的那条小河），让他的人划了过去。他们上了岸，爬上一座小山，看到了村庄和王公的寨子。他们砍下几棵树建造了自己的栅栏，随着暮色降临，等待着当地人回击。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Part of Kassim's plan involved Cornelius, because he spoke English. So the next day Kassim and Cornelius went to talk to Brown in his stockade. Brown listened to these offers of help and began to feel more hopeful. He had come to Patusan just to steal food, but perhaps here was an opportunity for him. Perhaps he could take control of Patusan, and make himself a rich man. He would work with this white man they called Tuan Jim, for a while anyway -- until it became necessary to kill him. This indeed was Cornelius's advice. "You must kill him as soon as you can," he said repeatedly. "Then you can have everything!"</div>

<div class="line_en">The people of Patusan were frightened and confused. Their white lord was away in another part of the country, so it was Dain Waris who had ordered the shooting. Women and children left their homes and crowded into Jim's house, where Jewel was in control. She also kept the ammunition, while Jim was absent. Doramin, his son, Jewel, the Rajah's adviser Kassim, and all the local chiefs and headmen met in Jim's house to decide what to do. Jewel and Dain Waris wanted to drive away the white men, but Doramin only seemed interested in keeping his son safe. Kassim was playing a clever game, hoping that these white men would attack and defeat Doramin's men before Jim returned. Meanwhile he smiled and listened, pretending to offer the Rajah's help against the white men.</div>

<div class="line_en">Later that day Brown saw from his stockade one of the villagers walking out of a house. He gave an order to one of his men, who fired a single shot. The native fell to the ground, dead. "That's right!" cried Brown delightedly. "Put the fear of sudden death in them!"</div>

<div class="line_en">Darkness fell, and soon one of the white men decided to go back to the boat to get his pipe. When he reached the creek, there was a bang, and he cried out in pain, "I've been hit!" Brown and the others listened to him dying slowly in the mud for several hours; they knew they could not help him.</div>

<div class="line_en">While this was happening, Dain Waris's canoes went silently down to an island at the mouth of the river.

Kassim sent food to Brown and his men, but did not tell them about the canoes.</div>

<div class="line_en">Soon Jim left the villagers behind and came on alone. Brown went down to the creek to meet him. He knew at once that he and Jim would never understand each other. Jim's clean white clothes, his honest eyes, and confident look made Brown hate him immediately. They spoke to each other, two men completely opposite in character, separated only by a muddy creek. Most of the time Jim listened, while Brown talked, choosing his words carefully. He knew nothing of Jim's past, but he was extremely clever at finding the weakest place in a man's soul, and, by an evil chance, he found his way to Jim's.</div>

But on board Brown's boat was the evil Cornelius, hiding under a sail. He was disappointed that Brown had not killed Jim, and he had decided to take his revenge in a different way. He had promised to show Brown another creek, which led to the small island further down the river, where Doramin's son and his men were waiting with their canoes. It was easy for Brown, who saw the chance to take revenge for his own misfortunes. Dain Waris and his men, with Tamb'Itam, were watching the bigger creek, and did not expect anyone to attack from the narrow creek behind them. When Brown's men fired their guns, several natives fell, including Dain Waris, who was shot through the head. The others ran away, screaming with fear. The white robbers were never seen again in Patusan, but it was known that their ship sank in the Indian Ocean a month later.</div>

<div class="line_en">Cornelius also died, because Tamb'Itam saw him on the island and realized what he had done. The narrow creek was impossible to find without help from someone who knew it.

<div class="line_en">Meanwhile in the village there was great sadness, and anger, as the body of the chief's son was brought home by canoe. Doramin looked at his dead son, and slowly, very slowly, took Jim's silver ring off the cold, stiff hand. The crowd cried out in horror when they saw that well-known ring, and Doramin suddenly let out a great violent shout, deep from the chest, like a wounded animal -- a cry of pain and anger. Then there was silence.</div>

<div class="line_en">When Jim arrived at Doramin's stockade, the crowd of crying, confused people separated, respectfully and fearfully, to allow him to enter. He walked slowly through them, right up to the old chief, who was sitting in his usual chair, with a gun on his knees. Doramin's wife was bending miserably over her son's body, which was covered with a sheet. Jim lifted the sheet to look at his dead friend, then dropped it without a word. He waited for a moment, then said gently, "I am responsible. I come in sadness, with no weapon. I am ready."</div>

<div class="line_en">The heavy old man was helped up from his chair, and the silver ring, which Jim had worn so proudly, fell to the floor. With an expression of mad pain and anger on his face, Doramin stared at Jim standing stiffly in front of him. Then, looking him straight in the eyes, he lifted his gun and shot his son's friend through the chest. Jim looked proudly and bravely round at all the staring faces, then, with a hand over his lips, he fell forward, dead.</div>

<div class="line_en">And that's the end. He disappears under a cloud, mysterious, forgotten, and much too romantic. Perhaps in that last, short moment he saw the face of his opportunity, waiting for him like an Eastern bride. He left the arms of a living woman who loved him, to marry the shadowy ghost of imagined honour and duty. Is he completely happy now, I wonder? We ought to know; he is one of us. Was I so very wrong, after all, to believe in him? Who knows? He is gone, and the poor girl is living a soundless, frozen life in Stein's house. Stein looks much older now, and is feeling his age. He often says he is "preparing to leave all this", while he waves his hand sadly at his butterflies.</div>
