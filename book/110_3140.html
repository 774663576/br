<div class="line_en">That evening the Count did not stay and talk with me, but before he left the room, he turned to me and said, "My young friend, sleep only in this room or your bedroom. You must never fall asleep in any other room in the castle. You will be in danger if you do."</div>

<div class="line_en">One evening the Count said, "You must write to your London office and tell Mr Hawkin that you'll be here for another month."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一天晚上伯爵说：“你必须给你伦敦的办公室写信，告诉霍金先生你要在这儿再待上一个月。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When I heard this, I went cold. Another month! But what could I do? I worked for Mr Hawkin, and the Count's business was important to him, so if the Count needed me, then I had to stay. I wrote my letter, but I knew that the Count planned to read it. I could not tell Mr Hawkin that I was a prisoner in Castle Dracula!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="听到这句话，我感到浑身冰凉。再待一个月！可我又能怎么办呢？我是为霍金先生工作的，伯爵的生意对于他来说非常重要，所以如果伯爵需要我，那我就必须留下来。于是我写了封信，但我知道伯爵肯定会看。我不能告诉霍金先生我成了德拉库拉城堡中的囚徒！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When he left, I went to my room, but I could not rest and began to walk round the castle. Many of the doors were locked, but I found one which was open. I pushed back the door and saw that there was a window in the room. It was a beautiful night and the mountains looked wonderful in the soft yellow light of the moon. Suddenly, something moved below me. It was the Count. Slowly, he came out of the window -- first those hands, like the hands of an animal, and then his head. He began to move down the wall, head first. With his black cloak around him, he looked like a horrible black bird -- and my blood ran cold. What was Count Dracula?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他一离开，我就到我的房间里去了，但我却无法入睡，于是就在城堡里转来转去。许多门都上着锁，但我发现有一扇门是开着的。我推门而入，看见屋里有一扇窗户。这是个美好的夜晚，群山在柔黄色的月光下显得那么美妙。突然，有什么东西在我下方移动，原来是伯爵。他正慢慢地爬出窗外——先是那双像动物一样的手，然后是他的脑袋。他开始头朝下地 顺着墙向下爬。黑色的斗篷罩在他身上，使他看起来像一只可怕的黑鸟——我吓得浑身发冷。德拉库拉伯爵到底是 什么东西？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Suddenly I felt that I was not alone. In the moonlight from the window I saw three beautiful young women. They were watching me, and talking quietly. "He is young and strong," one of them said.</div>

<div class="line_en">I shivered, and sat down for a minute. The room was warm and friendly. I think that many years ago it was a room for the ladies of the castle, and I decided not to go back to my cold, dark room, but to sleep in this room. So I lay down and closed my eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我颤抖着坐了一会儿。这间屋子既暖和又舒适。我想多年以前，它应该是城堡里贵妇人的房间，我决定不回我那间又冷又黑的屋子了，而在这间屋里睡觉。于是我躺下来闭上了眼睛。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Slowly I moved down the wall. Once or twice I almost fell, but at last I found myself in the Count's bedroom.</div>

<div class="line_en">The room was empty. The Count was not there. I looked for the castle keys, but I could not find them. Over in one corner of the room there was some gold, and on the other side of the room there was a big wooden door. It was open and I saw that there were some stairs going down. I went down them, and I came to another door. This was open too, and I found myself in a room with a stone floor. Slowly, I looked around me. There were about fifty wooden boxes in the room. They were coffins, and they were full of earth. In one of them lay the Count! I could not say if he was dead or asleep. His eyes were open and looked cold and stony, but his face did not look like the face of a dead man. His lips were still very red, but he did not move. Slowly I went nearer. I thought perhaps that he had the castle keys on him. But when I looked at those cold, stony eyes, my blood ran cold. Afraid, I turned and ran back to the window. I did not stop to think until I was back in my room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="屋子是空的，伯爵不在屋里。我找了找城堡的钥匙，但没找到。屋子的一个角落里有一些金子，另一边有一扇很大的木门。门是开着的，我看见有楼梯直通到下面。我下了楼梯来到另一扇门前。这扇门也是开着的，我发现自己已经进了一间石头铺地的屋子。我慢慢地环视了一下四周。屋里有大约50个木箱子。是棺材，里面装满了土，而伯爵就躺在其中一个棺材里！我看不出他是死了还是睡着了。他双目圆睁，看起来阴森森的，了无生气，但他的脸却并不像一个死人的脸。他的嘴唇依然是鲜红的，但他一动不动。我慢慢地靠近他。我想也许他身上有城堡的钥匙。但当我看着那双冷酷的眼睛时，我的血都凉了。我吓得转身跑回窗前。直到回到我的屋里，我才喘了口气想了想刚才的事情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Vampires can only come out at night, so I knew that there was no danger during the day. The next morning I decided to visit the Count's room to see what I could find. To do this I had to get into it by the window. This was possible because his room was just below my bedroom, and there were little holes in the wall between the stones. I could put my feet in these, and I could use the heavy curtains from my window to hold onto. It was dangerous, but I had to try.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吸血鬼只能在夜里出来，因此我知道白天不会有危险。第二天早晨我决定去窥探一下伯爵的房间，看看能找到什么。我只有通过窗户才能进到他的房间里去。这是可以做到的，因为他的屋子刚好在我的卧室下面，而且墙上的石头之间都有小洞，我可以把脚放在这些洞里，再抓着窗户上厚厚的窗帘。这很危险，但我必须试一试。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I lay down on my bed, but I did not sleep very well. During the night I heard women's voices outside my door, and then the Count, saying, "Wait. Your time has not yet come. Tomorrow night -- you can have him then." The women laughed, a low, sweet sound, and I shook with fear.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我躺在床上，但并没有睡好。晚上我听到门外有女人的说话声，然后又听到伯爵说：“等一等，还没到时候呢。明天晚上——他就是你们的了。”女人们笑了起来，声音很低，也很悦耳，我却吓得浑身发抖。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Count was there, in his coffin, but he looked younger and his hair was no longer white. There was blood on his mouth, which ran down across his neck. My hands were shaking, but I had to touch him, to look for the keys. I felt all over his body, but they weren't there. Suddenly I wanted to kill Count Dracula. I took a workman's hammer, and began to bring it down hard on to that horrible, smiling face. But just then the head turned and the Count's burning eyes looked at me. His bloody mouth smiled more horribly than ever. I dropped the hammer and stood there, shaking. What could I do now?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="伯爵就躺在他的棺材里，但他看起来年轻了，头发也不再是白的了。他嘴上有血，顺着脖子流下来。我的手开始发抖，但我必须要接触他才能找钥匙。我摸遍了他的全身，但并没有找到钥匙。突然我想杀死德托库拉伯爵。我拿起一把工人用的铁锤，开始向那张可怕的、微笑着的脸使劲砸去。正在这时伯爵的头转了过来，用一双愤怒的眼睛看着我。他血淋淋的嘴笑得比先前更恐怖了。我丢了铁锤站在那里，浑身颤抖。我该怎么办呢？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">While I was writing these words in my diary, I decided what to do. I must try to escape. I shall try to get down the wall outside.

<div class="line_cn" title="当我在日记中写下这些话时，我已经决定怎么做了。我必须设法逃走。我要顺着外面的墙爬下去。窗户离地面很高，但我还是要试一下。我要带上一些金子——如果我能逃脱，或许这些金子以后会有用的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I turned to run back downstairs, to find this open door. But I was too late. A cold wind ran through the castle and, with a crash, the door at the top of the stairs closed and locked itself. I could not get back down the stairs.</div>
