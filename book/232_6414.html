<div class="line_en">"Oh my God." Alan held his face in his hands. "She's probably dead. I'll never see her again."</div>

<div class="line_en">"OK, Mr Cole," Inspector Lee said. "Detectives are now searching the house in Bowater Gardens and your daughter's flat. I've informed the police at ports and airports too. It's possible that the kidnappers will try to take your daughter out of the country, you know."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好吧，科尔先生，”李探长说，“警官们正在搜索堡渥特花园和你女儿的公寓。我也已经通知了港口和机场的警察。绑架者很可能要把你女儿带出境外，你知道。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then Alan phoned the police, Detective Hall came to the hospital quickly, bringing an Inspector Lee with outside the door. Then they came back in.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿兰给警察局打电话后，荷尔警官立即来到医院，还带来了一位李探长。他们听了阿兰的叙述，然后在门外议论了一会儿。然后他们又折回走了进来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Try to keep calm, Mr Cole," said the Inspector. "You see, we're not sure that this Anna is a terrorist, We have already arrested the two men who put the bomb in the coach. In fact, one of them confessed to"this morning. The other one will confess soon."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“冷静些，科尔先生。”探长说，“你看，我们还没有肯定这个安娜就是个恐怖分子。我们已经抓了往马车里放炸弹的那两个人。实际上，其中一个已经在今天早上招供了。另一个很快也会承认的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Let's hope that's not true," said the Inspector. "Now, let's talk about this woman Anna again. Why do you think she's a terrorist?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“让我们希望那不是真的吧。”探长说，“现在让我们再来谈谈这个叫安娜的女人。你为什么认为她是恐饰分子呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Again, Alan explained. The visit to the Mews the evening before the bombing; the ten minutes when Anna was not with him; her phone call, telling him not to talk to the police or Jane would die. It was hard to speak clearly because he was so angry and afraid. He began to cry. "It's no good," he said. "Jane's going to die."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿兰又解释了一遍。爆炸前一晚到了马厩；安娜有10分钟没和他在一起；她打电话叫他不许跟警察说，否则简就得死。由于这么生气和害怕，他很难表达清楚。他开始哭了。“没有用了，”他说，“简要死了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Mmm," the Inspector said slowly."Now, your daughter. Was she unhappy to hear about Anna, do you think? Sometimes daughters don't like, their fathers to have girlfriends, you know. Perhaps she was angry with you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“呣，”探长慢慢地说，“现在谈谈你女儿。你觉得她在听到安娜的事时不高兴吗？你知道，有时女儿不喜欢父亲有女朋友。也许她生你的气了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But they are the wrong people -- they must be! If they are the murderers: Why did Anna phone me? Why is she saying she'll kill my daughter if I don't keep quiet about her?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可他们不是 —— 肯定不是！如果他们是杀人犯，安娜为什么要给我打电话呢？为什么她说要是我对她的事不保持沉默的话，她就要杀了我女儿呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Of course I am! And it was Jane's voice as well! I know my own daughter's voice, don't I?" Alan shouted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我当然肯定！而且还有简的声音！我能听出我自己女儿的声音，是不是？”阿兰嚷道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No. Not really. Well, perhaps a bit."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，真不是。不过，可能有一点儿。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I see some very strange things in my job, Mr Cole, and a lot of them are because of family arguments. It's just possible, you see, that your daughter hasn't been kidnapped at all: Perhaps she's angry with you and wants to stop you seeing Anna. Perhaps -- I've seen it happen before -- she's asked a friend to ring you and pretend to be Anna…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我在工作中碰到过一些奇怪的事，料尔先生，很多都是由于家庭纠纷造成的。你看，有可能你女儿根本没有被绑架。她可能只是生你的气，想让你不再见到安娜。也许 —— 我以前见过这种情况 —— 她让一个朋友给你打电话，假装是安娜…”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"The house in Bowater Gardens is empty," he told Alan. "The two people there left on the morning of. the bombing. We didn't find anything useful at your daughter's flat -- but we did find her handbag with her flat keys in it. It seems strange for her to go out without her keys, doesn't it?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“堡渥特花园的房子空着，”他告诉阿兰，“那两个人在爆炸的那天早晨离开了。我们在你女儿的公寓没发现什么有用的东西 —— 但我们找到了她的书包，里边还有门钥匙。她出门不带钥匙是奇怪，是不是？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They put the phone on a table next to Alan's bed. He stared at it, saying to himself over and over again:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们在阿兰床边的桌子上放了一部电话。他盯着电话，一遍一遍地默念着：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="那时另一个警官走进来悄声跟李探长说了几句话，李探长立即起身离开了屋子。他回来时脸上表情严肃。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"If your daughter has been kidnapped, she could be anywhere," the Inspector said. "Our only hope is that the kidnappers call you again, and then we can find out where the call came from. We're fixing up a phone for you now, and there'll. be two policewomen here with you all night. If Anna does phone, keep her talking. Tell her that you have said nothing to the police, and ask to speak to Jane. Say you must hear her voice."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“要是你女儿被绑架了，她可能在任何地方。”探长说，“我们唯一的希望是绑架者再给你来电话，那么我们就可以查出电话是从哪儿打来的。现在我们给你配一部电话，还会有两个女警察整夜陪着你。如果安娜真来电话，拖住她说话。告诉她你什么也没对警察说，’并要求跟简讲话。就说你必须听到她的声音。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For hours she tried to get free but it was impossible. The rope only hurt her wrists more. But at least she could move her hands, up and down the end of the old bed. Once, towards morning, she pulled the rope hard against the bed, but it didn't break. Instead, something cut her hand, and she had an idea.</div>
