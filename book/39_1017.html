<div class="line_en">Farid had warned me. He had. But, as it turned out, he had wasted his breath. We were driving down the cratered road that winds from Jalalabad to Kabul. The last time I'd traveled that road was in a tarpaulin-covered truck going the other way. Baba had nearly gotten himself shot by a singing, stoned Roussi officer -- Baba had made me so mad that night, so scared, and, ultimately, so proud. The trek between Kabul and Jalalabad, a bone-jarring ride down a teetering pass snaking through the rocks, had become a relic now, a relic of two wars. Twenty years earlier, I had seen some of the first war with my own eyes. Grim reminders of it were strewn along the road: burned carcasses of old Soviet tanks, overturned military trucks gone to rust, a crushed Russian jeep that had plunged over the mountainside. The second war, I had watched on my TV screen. And now I was seeing it through Farid's eyes. Swerving effortlessly around potholes in the middle of the broken road, Farid was a man in his element. He had become much chattier since our overnight stay at Wahid's house. He had me sit in the passenger seat and looked at me when he spoke. He even smiled once or twice. Maneuvering the steering wheel with his mangled hand, he pointed to mud-hut villages along the way where he'd known people years before. Most of those people, he said, were either dead or in refugee camps in Pakistan. "And sometimes the dead are luckier," he said.</div>

<div class="line_en">He pointed to the crumbled, charred remains of a tiny village. It was just a tuft of blackened, roofless walls now. I saw a dog sleeping along one of the walls. "I had a friend there once," Farid said. "He was a very good bicycle repairman. He played the tabla well too. The Taliban killed him and his family and burned the village." We drove past the burned village, and the dog didn't move. IN THE OLD DAYS, the drive from Jalalabad to Kabul took two hours, maybe a little more. It took Farid and me over four hours to reach Kabul. And when we did… Farid warned me just after we passed the Mahipar dam.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他指着一座遭受祝融之灾的小村落，现在它只是一些黑色的墙壁，没有屋顶。我看见有条狗睡在那些墙壁之下。“我在这里有过一个朋友，”法里德说，“他修理自行车的手艺很棒，手鼓也弹得不错。塔利班杀了他全家，放火烧掉这座村子。”我们驶过焚毁的村子，那条狗一动不动。曾几何时，贾拉拉巴特到喀布尔只要两个小时的车程，也许多一些。法里德和我开了四个小时才抵达喀布尔。而当我们到达…我们刚驶过玛希帕水库的时候，法里德便警告我。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Kabul is not the way you remember it," he said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“喀布尔不是你记忆中那样了。”他说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Farid gave me a look that said hearing is not the same as seeing. And he was right. Because when Kabul finally did unroll before us, I was certain, absolutely certain, that he had taken a wrong turn somewhere. Farid must have seen my stupefied expression; shuttling people back and forth to Kabul, he would have become familiar with that expression on the faces of those who hadn't seen Kabul for a long time. He patted me on the shoulder. "Welcome back," he said morosely. RUBBLE AND BEGGARS. Everywhere I looked, that was what I saw. I remembered beggars in the old days too -- Baba always carried an extra handful of Afghani bills in his pocket just for them; I'd never seen him deny a peddler. Now, though, they squatted at every street corner, dressed in shredded burlap rags, mud-caked hands held out for a coin. And the beggars were mostly children now, thin and grim-faced, some no older than five or six. They sat in the laps of their burqa-clad mothers alongside gutters at busy street corners and chanted "Bakhshesh, bakhshesh!" And something else, something I hadn't noticed right away: Hardly any of them sat with an adult male -- the wars had made fathers a rare commodity in Afghanistan.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="法里德看了我一眼，仿佛在说听见和看到不是一回事。他是对的。因为当我们最终驶进喀布尔，我敢肯定，绝对肯定，他一定开错路了。法里德肯定见到我目瞪口呆的表情，也许在累次载人进出喀布尔之后，他对这种久违了喀布尔的人脸上出现的神情早巳习以为常。他拍拍我的肩头，“欢迎你回来。”他忧郁地说。废墟和乞丐，触目皆是这种景象。我记得从前也有乞丐——爸爸身上总是额外带着一把阿富汗尼硬币，分发给他们；我从不曾见过他拒绝乞讨的人。可是如今，街头巷尾都能见到他们，身披破麻布，伸出脏兮兮的手，乞讨一个铜板。而如今乞食的多数是儿童，瘦小，脸色冷漠，有些不超过五六岁。妇女裹着长袍，坐在繁忙街道的水沟边，膝盖上是她们的儿子，一遍遍念着：“行行好，行行好！”还有别的，某种我一开始没有注意到的事情：几乎见不到有任何成年男子在他们身边——战争把父亲变成阿富汗的稀缺物品。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jadeh Maywand. Just north of us was the bone-dry Kabul River. On the hills to the south stood the broken old city wall. Just east of it was the Bala Hissar Fort -- the ancient citadel that the warlord Dostum had occupied in 1992 -- on the Shirdarwaza mountain range, the same mountains from which Mujahedin forces had showered Kabul with rockets between 1992 and 1996, inflicting much of the damage I was witnessing now. The Shirdarwaza range stretched all the way west. It was from those mountains that I remember the firing of the Topeh chasht, the "noon cannon." It went off every day to announce noontime, and also to signal the end of daylight fasting during the month of Ramadan. You'd hear the roar of that cannon all through the city in those days.</div>

<div class="line_en">Jadeh Maywand had turned into a giant sand castle. The buildings that hadn't entirely collapsed barely stood, with caved in roofs and walls pierced with rockets shells. Entire blocks had been obliterated to rubble. I saw a bullet-pocked sign half buried at an angle in a heap of debris. It read "DRINK COCA CO --" I saw children playing in the ruins of a windowless building amid jagged stumps of brick and stone. Bicycle riders and mule-drawn carts swerved around kids, stray dogs, and piles of debris. A haze of dust hovered over the city and, across the river, a single plume of smoke rose to the sky.</div>

<div class="line_en">A vehicle was approaching us. "Beard Patrol," Farid murmured. That was the first time I saw the Taliban. I'd seen them on TV on the Internet, on the cover of magazines, and in newspapers. But here I was now, less than fifty feet from them, telling myself that the sudden taste in my mouth wasn't unadulterated, naked fear. Telling myself my flesh hadn't suddenly shrunk against my bones and my heart wasn't battering. Here they came. In all their glory. The red Toyota pickup truck idled past us. A handful of sternfaced young men sat on their haunches in the cab, Kalashnikovs slung on their shoulders. They all wore beards and black turbans. One of them, a dark-skinned man in his early twenties with thick, knitted eyebrows twirled a whip in his hand and rhythmically swatted the side of the truck with it. His roaming eyes fell on me. Held my gaze. I'd never felt so naked in my entire life. Then the Talib spat tobacco-stained spittle and looked away. I found I could breathe again. The truck rolled down Jadeh Maywand, leaving in its trail a cloud of dust.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一辆汽车朝我们开来。“大胡子巡逻队。”法里德低声说。那是我第一次见到塔利班。我在电视上、互联网上、杂志封面上、报纸上见过他们。但如今我站在这里，离他们不到五十英尺，告诉自己心里突然涌起的并非纯粹的赤裸裸的恐惧；告诉自己我的血肉没有突然之间压着我的骨头，我的心跳没有加速。他们来了，趾高气扬。红色的丰田皮卡慢慢驶过我们。几个脸色严峻的青年人蹲在车斗上，肩膀扛着俄制步枪。他们全都留着大胡子，穿着黑色长袍。有个皮肤黝黑的家伙，看上去二十出头，皱着一双浓眉，手中挥舞着鞭子，有节奏地甩打车身一侧。他溜转的眼睛看见我，和我对望。终我一生，我从未觉得自己如此无遮无拦。接着那个塔利班吐了一口沾有烟丝的口水，眼睛移开。我发现自己又能呼吸了。皮卡沿雅德梅湾驶去，在车后卷起一阵尘雾。">查看中文翻译</div>

His left eyelid drooped over an empty socket. With an arthritic hand, he pointed to the direction the red truck had gone. "They drive around looking. Looking and hoping that someone will provoke them. Sooner or later, someone always obliges. Then the dogs feast and the day's boredom is broken at last and everyone says 'Allah-u-akbar!'

<div class="line_en">"What? Please tell me." Baba had always described my mother to me in broad strokes, like, "She was a great woman." But what I had always thirsted for were the details: the way her hair glinted in the sunlight, her favorite ice cream flavor, the songs she liked to hum, did she bite her nails? Baba took his memories of her to the grave with him. Maybe speaking her name would have reminded him of his guilt, of what he had done so soon after she had died. Or maybe his loss had been so great, his pain so deep, he couldn't bear to talk about her. Maybe both. "She said, 'I'm so afraid.' And I said, 'Why?,' and she said, 'Because I'm so profoundly happy, Dr. Rasul. Happiness like this is frightening.' I asked her why and she said, 'They only let you be this happy if they're preparing to take something from you,' and I said, 'Hush up, now. Enough of this silliness." Farid took my arm. "We should go, Amir agha," he said softly. I snatched my arm away. "What else? What else did she say?" Theold man's features softened. "I wish I remembered for you. But I don't.

<div class="line_en">We left the old man on the steps of that building. I meant to take him up on his offer, come back and see if he'd unearthed any more stories about my mother. But I never saw him again. WE FOUND THE NEW ORPHANAGE in the northern part of Karteh-Seh, along the banks of the dried-up Kabul River. It was a flat, barracks-style building with splintered walls and windows boarded with planks of wood. Farid had told me on the way there that Karteh-Seh had been one of the most war-ravaged neighborhoods in Kabul, and, as we stepped out of the truck, the evidence was overwhelming. The cratered streets were flanked by little more than ruins of shelled buildings and abandoned homes. We passed the rusted skeleton of an overturned car, a TV set with no screen half-buried in rubble, a wall with the words ZENDA BAD TAL IRAN! (Long live the Taliban!) sprayed in black. A short, thin, balding man with a shaggy gray beard opened the door. He wore a ragged tweed jacket, a skullcap, and a pair of eyeglasses with one chipped lens resting on the tip of his nose. Behind the glasses, tiny eyes like black peas flitted from me to Farid. "Salaam alaykum," he said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们离开了坐在那座房子台阶上的老人。我原想带他到他的办公室去，看看他能否想起更多关于我妈妈的事情。但我再也没有见到他我们发现新恤孤院在卡德察区北边，紧邻干涸的喀布尔河河堤。那是一座平房，军营式建筑，墙上有裂缝，窗户用木板封上。前去的途中，法里德告诉我说，在喀布尔各个城区中，卡德察区受战争破坏最严重，而当我们下车，证据太明显了。立在满是弹坑的街道两旁的，只有比废墟好不了多少的破落建筑，以及久无人烟的房子。我们走过一具锈蚀的轿车残骸，看到一台半截埋在碎石堆里面、没有荧屏的电视机，一堵涂着黑色“塔利班万岁”标语的墙壁。应门的是个秃顶男人，矮矮瘦瘦，留着蓬松的灰白胡子。他穿着旧斜纹呢夹克，戴着无边便帽，眼镜挂在鼻尖上，有块镜片已经碎裂。眼镜后面，黑豆似的眼珠在我和法里德身上扫来扫去。“你好。”他说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Thank you so much." And I meant it. Now I knew my mother had liked almond cake with honey and hot tea, that she'd once used the word "profoundly," that she'd fretted about her happiness. I had just learned more about my mother from this old man on the street than I ever did from Baba. Walking back to the truck, neither one of us commented about what most non-Afghans would have seen as an improbable coincidence, that a beggar on the street would happen to know my mother. Because we both knew that in Afghanistan, and particularly in Kabul, such absurdity was commonplace. Baba used to say, "Take two Afghans who've never met, put them in a room for ten minutes, and they'll figure out how they're related."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“太谢谢你了。”我是说真的。现在我知道妈妈曾经喜欢涂了蜂蜜的杏仁蛋糕，还有热红茶，知道她用过“深深地”这个词，知道她曾为快乐烦恼过。我对妈妈的了解，从这个街头老人身上得到的，甚至比从爸爸身上知道的还要多。露宿街头的老乞丐恰好认识我妈妈，这在多数非阿富汗人眼里，也许会是匪夷所思的巧合，但我们对此只字不提，默默走回那辆汽车。因为我们知道，在阿富汗，特别是在喀布尔，这样的荒唐事情司空见惯。爸爸过去说过：“把两个素昧平生的阿富汗人关在同一间屋子里，不消十分钟，他们就能找出他们之间的亲戚关系。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"More than we have room for. About two hundred and fifty," Zaman said over his shoulder. "But they're not all yateem.

He made a sweeping gesture with his hand and added ruefully, "This place is better than the street, but not that much better.

<div class="line_cn" title="“法里德，坐下！让他说！”但已经太迟了，因为突然间法里德跳上桌子。他纵身而下，将察曼的椅子踢飞，把他按倒在地。察曼在法里德身下挥舞着手，发出声声闷叫。他的脚踢掉一个抽屉，纸片散落在地面。我跑到桌子那边，这才发现察曼的叫声为何闷住：法里德扼住他的脖子。我双手抓住法里德的肩膀，使劲拉。他挣脱我。“够了！”我大喊。但法里德的脸涨得通红，张口狂叫：“我要杀了他！你不能阻止我！我要杀了他！”他冷笑。“放开他！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"He took Sohrab a month ago," Zaman finally croaked, hands still shielding his face.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I'm killing him!" Something in his voice told me that if I didn't do something quickly I'd witness my first murder. "The children are watching, Farid. They're watching," I said. His shoulder muscles tightened under my grip and, for a moment, I thought he'd keep squeezing Zaman's neck anyway. Then he turned around, saw the children. They were standing silently by the door, holding hands, some of them crying. I felt Farid's muscles slacken. He dropped his hands, rose to his feet. He looked down on Zaman and dropped a mouthful of spit on his face. Then he walked to the door and closed it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我要杀了他！”他的叫声让我明白，如果我不尽快采取行动，就只好目睹有生以来见到的第一场谋杀了。“孩子们在看着，法里德。他们在看着。”我说。他肩膀的肌肉在我手中缩紧，那当头，我以为他不管怎样都会扼着察曼的脖子不放。然而他回头，看到了孩子们。他们默默站在门外，手拉手，有的还哭起来。我觉得法里德的肌肉松弛了，他放手站起来，低头看着察曼，在他脸上吐了一口口水。然后他走到门边，把门关上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Zaman struggled to his feet, blotted his bloody lips with his sleeve, wiped the spit off his cheek. Coughing and wheezing, he put on his skullcap, his glasses, saw both lenses had cracked, and took them off. He buried his face in his hands. None of us said anything for a long time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="察曼挣扎着站起身，用袖子去擦血淋淋的嘴唇，擦掉脸上的口水。他咳嗽，喘息，戴好便帽和眼镜，看到两块镜片都破了，又把眼镜摘下。他双手掩脸。好长一段时间，我们谁也没说话。">查看中文翻译</div>
