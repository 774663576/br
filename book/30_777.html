<div class="line_en">Early in the term, I started pestering my mother to put an extra apple or peach in my lunch. I never quite worked up the courage to say it was for my teacher, as I never quite worked up the courage to hand my offering to Miss Benson directly. Each day the delicacy found its way unobserved to the corner of her desk. And each day the response was the same.</div>

<div class="line_en">Miss Benson was the kindest, sweetest, most beautiful creature that ever walked the earth. She was my second-grade teacher, and I was going to marry her when I grew up -- if she would wait. I would sit squirming in my seat for the entire morning to keep from raising my hand. I could not bear to miss one precious moment of her presence by leaving the room.</div>

<div class="line_en">My hand was always the first to be raised, however, when Miss Benson called for volunteers to clean the blackboards or to gather papers and bring them to her desk. That was the best chore of all. It made possible getting near enough to her to close out the others in the classroom. I would arrange and rearrange the papers. They had to be in perfect order before I would make my reluctant way back to my seat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，当老师问谁愿意擦黑板，谁愿意收卷子交到讲台上，我总是头一个举手。这可是最美的差事了。可以撇开班上的其他同学，越来越接近她。我会把卷子一遍遍地重新整理，放得整整齐齐，才依依不舍地回到我的座位上去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I would feel the red rising in my face. I was certain that everyone was looking at me, and I would sigh with when Miss Benson put the fruit away and started the lesson.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我觉得我的脸发红了。我肯定大伙都在盯着我看，只见老师把水果放在一边，开始讲课，我这才松了一口气。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">One fall morning, the class was abuzz with excitement. Someone had discovered that the next day, Friday, was Miss Benson's birthday. Everyone wanted to get her a present. My heart gave a leap, at last I could give her something openly. That afternoon was spent combing the fields for wild flowers. Not many were in bloom at that time of year, but I found several kinds of bright berries on shrubs, some dry thistle heads. And finally I came upon a patch of gorgeous crimson leaves…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一个秋天的上午，全班都兴奋地闹腾起来。原来有人发现，第二天星期五，是班森老师的生日。每个人都想要送个礼物给她。我的心都快要跳出来了，我终于可以大大方方送她东西了。那天下午，我一直在田野里搜寻野花。那个季节还在盛开的花不多见了，但我还是在灌木丛里找到了好几种明亮鲜艳的浆果，摘到些干枯的蓟花头。最后我还看到有一小块地里，有好一片艳丽的深红色的叶子…">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In the morning I hung back as others presented their gifts. Finally I went to the desk and gave the bouquet to Miss Benson. She exclaimed with pleasure as she took it, and held it to her cheek for a moment. My reward was a smile and a pat on the head.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天早晨，大家都纷纷献上了他们的礼物，我却退缩了。最后，我走上讲台，把一束花送给了老师。她接过花，欣喜得叫了起来，又把花捧在脸颊上。她对我报以一笑，还轻轻拍了下我的头。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“报告，不知道。”我回答。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Miss Benson," he said, slowly and clearly. "is in the hospital, and you sent her there!"</div>
