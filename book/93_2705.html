<div class="line_en">Jen had a secret, a secret she never told anyone: she was an amateur writer. She had a love for writing. Her writing is comprised by essays, fables, poems, and true stories about people she had come to know. Writing compositions about her childhood she could recall or anything that: kept her interest. Jen never told anyone about her love for writing. She always felt people would consider her as a bit crazy. With so many activities to do on weekends, why would she choose to sit and write?</div>

<div class="line_en">Jen was so glad to be out of the city for a few days. This was her weekend retreat. She loved the cabin. and it gave her confidence and peace and complacency in herself. Jen worked everyday in an attorney's office as a consultant. She handled stacks of legal documents daily. So when the weekend and holidays came around she would head for her cabin. Her cabin was thirty-seven miles from the city. It was excluded from other cabins at the lake. She liked it that way.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="珍妮弗很高兴能离开这个城市几天。这是她的周末度假地。她喜欢小木屋。这给了她自信、平静和自满。珍每天都在律师事务所当顾问。她每天处理一大堆法律文件。因此，当周末和假期来临时，她就会回到自己的小屋。她的小屋离市区有三十七英里。它被排除在湖边的其他小木屋之外。她喜欢这样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Her white sleeping gown hung below her knees with just a white cotton lace. Her soft hair was loosely tied back with a piece of purple ribbon softly and gloriously falling out the sides and touching her cheeks of pale skin.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她的白色睡袍垂到膝盖以下，只有一个白色的棉花花边。她的柔软的头发松散地扎在后面，一条紫色的丝带轻柔地从两边光荣地垂下来，触摸着她苍白的脸颊。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The morning was moist, and the fog had set in last evening and still masked over the shabby cabin hidden deep within the Turtle Mountains. She shivered as she stepped bare foot onto unfinished slabs that held her deck together. She had purchased the slabs from the Hillbilly Board Store.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="早晨很潮湿，昨天晚上就开始起雾了，但是还是遮住了龟山深处那间破旧的小屋。当她光着脚踩上未完工的连接着她的甲板的石板时，她浑身发抖。这些石板是她从乡巴佬铺子里买来的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She would write a song, then hum it-and sing it to herself until she believed it was a real song, real like the songs on the radio or television or even imagined some famous singer singing her song.</div>

<div class="line_en">The cabin was perfect: the breeze was fragrant and she could hear frogs croak from time to time. She would sit with her pen in hand and her spiral tablets and would write whatever came to her mind. Sometimes her novels and stories would dominate her and make her cry so hard that she would have to put her writing down and ask herself why she was doing this.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="小屋非常完美：微风吹来芬芳，她能时不时听到青蛙的呱呱叫声。她会坐在那里，手里拿着钢笔和螺旋形的药片，想到什么就写什么。有时她的小说和故事会支配她，让她哭得如此厉害，以至于她不得不放下她的写作，问问自己为什么要这样做。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">From her standpoint, writing gave her a feeling of complete satisfaction with herself. It's not her expertise but it helped her to experience successes and overcome the pain she had endured throughout her lifetime. It helped her to articulate the feelings deep in her heart. It helped her to bring imaginary people and places to reality in her mind. It was a freedom no one ever knew. Her writing was her true complement and soul mate that she could trust.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从她的角度来看，写作给了她一种完全满足的感觉。这不是她的专业知识，但它帮助她经历成功，克服了她一生中所经历的痛苦。这有助于她表达她内心深处的感情。它帮助她把想象中的人和地方带到她脑海中的现实。这是一种没有人知道的自由。她的作品是她真正的补充，是她可以信任的灵魂伴侣。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jen recently has purchased a computer and took an oath to herself that she would compile her writings and put them into the computer just to have for herself. It was an undertaking which would take a while but having her writings organized for the first time would be great.</div>

<div class="line_en">The cabin was small in dimension, having four rooms to be exact, but it was all Jen needed. Her living room and kitchen were combined in one large room only the kitchen table separating them. The bedroom was direct opposite the living-room and the bathroom facing the kitchen. The backside of the cabin was an enclosed porch that was screened to enjoy a fresh breeze in the warm evenings and yet keep the irritating bugs away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="客舱的尺寸很小，确切地说有四个房间，但这正是珍所需要的。她的起居室和厨房合并在一个大房间里，只有厨房的桌子把它们分开。卧室正对着客厅，浴室正对着厨房。机舱的后面是一个封闭的门廊，在温暖的夜晚可以享受到清新的微风，同时还能赶走烦人的虫子。">查看中文翻译</div>
