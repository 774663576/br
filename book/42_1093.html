<div class="line_en">Stanley stood in the shower and let the cold water pour over his hot and sore body. It was four minutes of heaven. For the second day in a row he didn't use soap. He was too tired.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯坦利站在喷头下，任由冷水浇在自己炙热酸痛的身体上。这是四分钟的天堂时光。他已经连续两天没用肥皂了。他太累了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Nearly everything in the room was broken; the TV, the pinball machine, the furniture. Even the people looked broken, with their worn-out bodies sprawled over the various chairs and sofas.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="房间里几乎找不到一个完好无损的物件——电视机、弹子球游戏机和家具无一例外。就连待在里面的人也都挑不出一个像样的，他们将自己倦怠的身体懒洋洋地瘫在各色各样的椅子和沙发里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He put on his clean set of orange clothes. He returned to his tent, put his dirty clothes in his crate, got out his pen and box of stationery, and headed to the rec room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯坦利换上那身干净的衣服，回到帐篷，把脏衣服放进板条箱，又取出钢笔和文具盒，然后去了活动室。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">X-Ray and Armpit were playing pool. The surface of the table reminded Stanley of the surface of the lake. It was full of bumps and holes because so many people had carved their initials into the felt.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="X光和胳肢窝正在玩桌球。桌面让斯坦利想起了翠湖的湖面。桌面坑坑洼洼的，因为很多人将名字首字母刻在桌面毡布上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was a hole in the far wall, and an electric fan had been placed in front of it. Cheap air-conditioning. At least the fan worked.</div>

<div class="line_en">The last thing he wanted to do after killing himself all day on the lake was to get in a fight with a boy called the Caveman. He was glad X-Ray and Armpit had come to his rescue.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在湖上把自己折磨了一整天之后，他最不情愿做的事情就是跟一个名叫洞穴人的男孩打上一架。他很高兴X光和胳肢窝帮他解了围。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“好玩？”斯坦利问道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No way," said X-Ray. "The second hole's a lot harder. You're hurting before you even get started. If you think you're sore now, just wait and see how you feel tomorrow morning, right?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“错了，”X光说，“第二个会更难挖，还没开始你就已经感到疼了。要是你现在觉得浑身酸痛，那就等着看看明天早上你的感觉怎么样。对吧？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That's right," said Squid.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没错。”乌贼说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Stanley looked around the room. This was the one place in camp where the boys could enjoy themselves, and what'd they do? They wrecked it. The glass on the TV was smashed, as if someone had put his foot through it. Every table and chair seemed to be missing at least one leg. Everything leaned.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯坦利往四下看了看。这是营区里唯一个男孩们可以尽情玩耍的地方，可他们都干了什么呢？他们把这间房彻底毁了。电视机的屏幕被砸烂了，像是被人用脚踹穿的。桌子和椅子看起来都少了至少一条腿。每样东西都七扭八歪的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="斯坦利环顾四周，这才明白胳肢窝和乌贼是在叫他。“哦，好的。”说完他把笔放进文具盒，然后起身跟着男孩们出去吃饭了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes, they did," he said. He wondered how Zero knew that. Brand X was a popular brand of sneakers. Maybe Clyde Livingston made a commercial for them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，两只都有。”斯坦利说道。他很好奇零蛋是怎么知道的。X牌是非常时髦的运动鞋品牌，没准克莱德·利文斯顿给这个牌子做过广告。">查看中文翻译</div>
