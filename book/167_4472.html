<div class="line_en">Ser Cortnay Penrose wore no armor. He sat a sorrel stallion, his standard-bearer a dapple grey. Above them flapped Baratheon's crowned stag and the crossed quills of Penrose, white on a russet field. Ser Cortnay's spade-shaped beard was russet as well, though he'd gone wholly bald on top. If the size and splendor of the king's party impressed him, it did not show on that weathered face.</div>

<div class="line_en">Every man of the party was of better birth and higher station than Davos Seaworth, and the great lords glittered in the morning sun. Silvered steel and gold inlay brightened their armor, and their warhelms were crested in a riot of silken plumes, feathers, and cunningly wrought heraldic beasts with gemstone eyes. Stannis himself looked out of place in this rich and royal company. Like Davos, the king was plainly garbed in wool and boiled leather, though the circlet of red gold about his temples lent him a certain grandeur. Sunlight flashed off its flame-shaped points whenever he moved his head.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这群人里的每一个都比戴佛斯·席渥斯出身高贵，地位优厚。朝阳下，南方的大诸侯们闪闪发光。他们穿着镀金镀银的铠甲，战盔上装饰着丝羽、翎毛或做成家徽形状、眼睛镶嵌宝石的雕像。而在这群富贵荣华的队伍中，你一眼就能认出史坦尼斯，和戴佛斯一样，国王着装朴素，只穿了羊毛衣和皮甲，只有头戴的赤金王冠分外夺目。国王移动时，阳光洒在火焰形状的冠沿上，映出璀璨光辉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They trotted up with much clinking of chain and rattle of plate. Even Davos wore mail, though he could not have said why; his shoulders and lower back ached from the unaccustomed weight. It made him feel cumbered and foolish, and he wondered once more why he was here. It is not for me to question the king's commands, and yet…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大队人马跑动时链甲、板甲哐当作响。戴佛斯本人也穿了盔甲，只觉得很不适应：肩膀和后背正因这不习惯的重量而酸痛不适呢。他认定自己看起来一定累赘又愚蠢，不禁又一次怀疑来此的必要。我不该质疑国王的命令，可…">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This was the closest Davos had come to His Grace in the eight days since Black Betha had joined the rest of the fleet off Storm's End. He'd sought an audience within an hour of his arrival, only to be told that the king was occupied. The king was often occupied, Davos learned from his son Devan, one of the royal squires. Now that Stannis Baratheon had come into his power, the lordlings buzzed around him like flies round a corpse. He looks half a corpse too, years older than when I left Dragonstone. Devan said the king scarcely slept of late. "Since Lord Renly died, he has been troubled by terrible nightmares," the boy had confided to his father. "Maester's potions do not touch them. Only the Lady Melisandre can soothe him to sleep."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="自黑贝莎号返航并加入封锁风息堡的舰队以来，整整八天过去了，但此刻竟是戴佛斯和自己的国王靠得最近的一次。本来刚一抵达，他便要求面见国王，却被告知国王很忙。国王最近一直很忙，这点戴佛斯从儿子戴冯那里了解到了，儿子是王家侍从之一。如今史坦尼斯·拜拉席恩的权势大大增强，贵族诸侯们便成天围着他，嗡嗡唧唧，活像尸体上的苍蝇。他看起来的确像半具尸体啊，和我离开龙石岛那时相比，苍老了许多。戴冯说最近国王几乎不能入睡。“蓝礼大人死后，他就为噩梦所困扰，”男孩向父亲倾诉，“连学士的药也不管用。只有梅丽珊卓夫人有办法安抚他入眠。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Is that why she shares his pavilion now? Davos wondered. To pray with him? Or does she have another way to soothe him to sleep? it was an unworthy question, and one he dared not ask, even of his own son. Devan was a good boy, but he wore the flaming heart proudly on his doublet, and his father had seen him at the nightfires as dusk fell, beseeching the Lord of Light to bring the dawn. He is the king's squire, he told himself, it is only to be expected that he would take the king's god.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这就是她和他同住大帐的原因？戴佛斯纳闷。一起祈祷？还是用别的法子安抚他入眠？这问题不仅逾越，而且他也不敢问，即使问自己儿子也不妥。戴冯是个好孩子，但他的上衣上骄傲地绣着烈焰红心，某日黄昏，父亲也见他在篝火前祈祷，恳求真主光之王赐予黎明。他是国王的侍从呀，他告诉自己，理当好好侍奉国王的神灵。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ser Cortnay Penrose ignored him, preferring to address Stannis. "This is a notable company. The great lords Estermont, Errol, and Varner. Ser Jon of the green-apple Fossoways and Ser Bryan of the red. Lord Caron and Ser Guyard of King Renly's Rainbow Guard… and the puissant Lord Alester Florent of Brightwater, to be sure. Is that your Onion Knight I spy to the rear? Well met, Ser Davos. I fear I do not know the lady."</div>

<div class="line_en">Davos had almost forgotten how high and thick the walls of Storm's End loomed up close. King Stannis halted beneath them, a few feet from Ser Cortnay and his standard-bearer. "Ser," he said with stiff courtesy. He made no move to dismount.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="戴佛斯几乎遗忘了风息堡的墙垒是多么高大雄伟，直到如今它们重新逼近他的眼帘方才再度感叹于此地的气势。史坦尼斯国王在高墙下停住，离科塔奈爵士和他的掌旗官数尺之遥。“爵士先生，”他带着僵硬的礼貌开口，没有下马的意思。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It is customary to grant a king the style Your Grace," announced Lord Florent. A red gold fox poked its shining snout out from his breastplate through a circle of lapis lazuli flowers. Very tall, very courtly, and very rich, the Lord of Brightwater Keep had been the first of Renly's bannermen to declare for Stannis, and the first to renounce his old gods and take up the Lord of Light. Stannis had left his queen on Dragonstone along with her uncle Axell, but the queen's men were more numerous and powerful than ever, and Alester Florent was the foremost.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“遵照正式礼仪，面见国王应该尊称陛下。”佛罗伦伯爵朗声宣布。他的胸甲上刻了一条光彩夺目的红金狐狸，旁边围着一圈天青石色的花。这位亮水城伯爵高大、尊严、富贵，在蓝礼的部属中头一个倒向史坦尼斯，也是头一位公开宣布弃绝旧神，改信光之王的南境诸侯。史坦尼斯把王后和她叔叔亚赛尔爵士留在龙石岛，但后党的势力却不减反增，不论成员还是权势都变得空前庞大，这其中艾利斯特·佛罗伦自然居功至伟。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">An angry clamor went up from the king's men. He is not far wrong, Davos thought. Only a short time before, the Fossoways, Guyard Mon rigen, and the Lords Caron, Varner, Errol, and Estermont had all belonged to Renly. They had sat in his pavilion, helped him make his battle plans, plotted how Stannis might be brought low. And Lord Florent had been with them -- he might be Queen Selyse's own uncle, but that had not kept the Lord of Brightwater from bending his knee to Renly when Renly's star was rising.</div>

<div class="line_en">The fires behind them had melted into one vague glow against the black sky, and the land was almost out of sight. It was time to come about. "Watch your head, my lady." He pushed on the tiller, and the small boat threw up a curl of black water as she turned. Melisandre leaned under the swinging yard, one hand on the gunwale, calm as ever. Wood creaked, canvas cracked, and water splashed, so loudly a man might swear the castle was sure to hear. Davos knew better. The endless crash of wave on rock was the only sound that ever penetrated the massive seaward walls of Storm's End, and that but faintly.</div>

<div class="line_en">Frowning, Davos hushed her then. They were coming close to shore once more, and voices carried across the water. He rowed, the faint sound of his oars lost in the rhythm of the waves. The seaward side of Storm's End perched upon a pale white cliff, the chalky stone sloping up steeply to half again the height of the massive curtain wall. A mouth yawned in the cliff, and it was that Davos steered for, as he had sixteen years before. The tunnel opened on a cavern under the castle, where the storm lords of old had built their landing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="戴佛斯皱起眉头，示意她静声。他们已再次接近陆地，声音很容易被对面听到。他配合波涛的节律，持续划水。风息堡的临海墙栖息在一片苍白的悬崖上，倾斜而险峻的白垩石壁几乎是外墙的两倍高。山崖低部有个口子，那里正是戴佛斯的目的地，一如他十六年前之所为。这个隧道直通向城堡下的洞穴，那是古代列位风暴之王的码头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The passage was navigable only during high tide, and was never less than treacherous, but his smuggler's skills had not deserted him. Davos threaded their way deftly between the jagged rocks until the cave mouth loomed up before them. He let the waves carry them inside. They crashed around him, slamming the boat this way and that and soaking them to the skin. A half-seen finger of rock came rushing up out of the gloom, snarling foam, and Davos barely kept them off it with an oar.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这条路很难走，只在潮水高涨时才可航行，即使如此，其中也是危险重重。然而他在走私生涯中学来的技巧仍旧不减当年。戴佛斯在参差不齐的乱石中灵巧地挑选道路，直到洞穴入口笼罩在眼前。他听凭波涛引领入洞。它们环绕着来客，撞击着来客，将小船掀得东倒西歪，把他们全身浸湿。一块礁石如忽隐忽现的手指，在阴沉的暗流中浮现，白沫纠结，然而戴佛斯用桨灵巧一拨，避开了危机。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The little boat slowed and swirled. The sound of their breathing echoed until it seemed to surround them. Davos had not expected the blackness. The last time, torches had burned all along the tunnel, and the eyes of starving men had peered down through the murder holes in the ceiling. The portcullis was somewhere ahead, he knew. Davos used the oars to slow them, and they drifted against it almost gently.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="小船慢下来，缓缓打转。他们的呼吸声在洞中回荡，直到将他们完全包围。戴佛斯没想到这么黑。上次来时，整个隧道插满燃烧的火把，饥饿的人们从顶上的杀人洞目不转睛地瞅着下面。他记得，闸门就在前方某处，于是用桨放慢船速，桨边的水流出奇地温柔。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Davos raised a hand to shield his eyes, and his breath caught in his throat. Melisandre had thrown back her cowl and shrugged out of the smothering robe. Beneath, she was naked, and huge with child. Swollen breasts hung heavy against her chest, and her belly bulged as if near to bursting. "Gods preserve us," he whispered, and heard her answering laugh, deep and throaty. Her eyes were hot coals, and the sweat that dappled her skin seemed to glow with a light of its own. Melisandre shone.</div>

<div class="line_en">Panting, she squatted and spread her legs. Blood ran down her thighs, black as ink. Her cry might have been agony or ecstasy or both. And Davos saw the crown of the child's head push its way out of her. Two arms wriggled free, grasping, black fingers coiling around Melisandre's straining thighs, pushing, until the whole of the shadow slid out into the world and rose taller than Davos, tall as the tunnel, towering above the boat. He had only an instant to look at it before it was gone, twisting between the bars of the portcullis and racing across the surface of the water, but that instant was long enough.</div>
