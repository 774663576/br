Wherefore we most heartily provoke, challenge, and defy your Lordship to the said combat and monomachy, and have sent these letters by the hand of our well beloved and royal brother Edmund, sometime King under us in Narnia, Duke of Lantern Waste and Count of the Western March, Knight of the Noble Order of the Table, to whom we have given full power of determining with your Lordship all the conditions of the said battle.

Nor indeed would the other boys at Edmund's school have recognized him if they could have seen him at that moment. For Aslan had breathed on him at their meeting and a kind of greatness hung about him.</div>

<div class="line_en">"No man of your Majesty's age," said Glozelle, "would be called coward by any wise soldier for refusing the combat with a great warrior in the flower of his youth."</div>

<div class="line_en">"I see what it is," said Miraz, after staring at them as if his eyes would start out of his head, "you are as lilylivered as hares yourselves and have the effrontery to imagine my heart after the likeness of yours! Grounds for a refusal, indeed! Excuses for not fighting! Are you soldiers? Are you Telmarines? Are you men? And if I dog refuse it (as ail good reasons of captaincy and martial policy urge me to do) you will think, and teach others tan think, I was afraid. Is it not so?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我明白了，”瞪着眼盯了他们半晌，弥若兹终于说道，“你们是两个胆小如鼠的家伙，却把我也当成与你们一样无用的东西！找拒绝的理由，找不战的借口。好畦，你们还是不是军人？你们还是不是台尔马人的子孙？你们还算是男子汉吗？假如我拒绝挑战（尽管我有充分的理由这么做，而且我的经验、我的感觉都告诉我应该这么做），你们就会认为，并且使别人相信，我是由于胆怯才拒绝挑战，对不对？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"So I'm to be a dotard with one foot in the grave, as well as a dastard," roared Miraz. "I'll tell you what it is, my Lords. With your womanish counsels (ever shying from the true point, which is one of policy) you have done the very opposite of your intent. I had meant to refuse it. But I'll accept it. Do you hear, accept it! I'll not be shamed because some witchcraft or treason has frozen both your bloods."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这么说，我已经半截入土、行将就木了，是吗？”弥若兹咆哮起来，“我要让你们亲眼看一看，我的阁下！你们这种婆娘式的劝告，结果适得其反！我原打算拒绝这挑战，可现在我宣布，我正式接受它。你们听清楚没有，我接受了！应该感到羞耻的是你们！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"We beseech your Majesty --" said Glozelle, but Miraz had flung out of the tent and they could hear him bawling out his acceptance to Edmund. The two lords looked at one another and chuckled quietly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们为陛下的安全深表……”哥洛的话还没有说完，弥若兹早已疾步走出帐篷。他们听到他大声对爱德蒙宣布应战的决定，互相挤挤眼睛，无声地笑了起来。。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was a great stirring at Aslan's How when the news came back and was communicated to the various creatures. Edmund, with one of Miraz's captains, had already marked out the place for the combat, and ropes and stakes had been put round it. Two Telmarines were to stand at two of the corners, and one in the middle of one side, as marshals of the lists. Three marshals for the other two corners and the other side were to be furnished by the High King. Peter was just explaining to Caspian that he could not be one, because his right to the throne was what they were fighting about, when suddenly a thick, sleepy voice said, "Your Majesty, please." Peter turned and there stood the eldest of the Bulgy Bears. "If you please, your Majesty," he said, "I'm a bear, I am."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="使者带回的消息不胫而走，在阿斯兰堡垒引起一阵激动。爱德蒙和弥若兹手下的一个队长共同划出了决斗的场地，并打下界桩，用绳子圈了起来。双方将各派三个人站立在决斗场的两端，作为决斗的助手和公证人。这时候，彼得正忙着给凯斯宾鼓气，使他相信自己绝非孤军作战，因为他们进行的是一场正义的战争。突然，他们身边响起了一个带点儿睡意的粗嗓子：“陛下，能听我说一句话吗？”彼得转过身来，看清那是一只年长的大棕熊。“陛下，是我大棕熊，陛下。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“别派它去当助手，”杜鲁普金小声对彼得说，“不错，它秉性善良，但是派去当公证人，它会给我们丢脸的。它会在决斗还没有结束的时候呼呼睡大觉。它还会吮它的爪子——当着敌人的面这么做！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Sire," said Reepicheep. "My life is ever at your command, but my honour is my own. Sire, I have among my people the only trumpeter in your Majesty's army.

Perhaps if it were your pleasure that I should be a marshal of the lists, it would content them."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“陛下，我的生命可以随你支配，但我的荣誉只属于我自己。”雷佩契普讲到这里，眼里流露出一丝忧伤。“陛下，我的部下中有我们大军惟一的吹鼓手。本来我以为会被挑选去下战书的，结果我失望了，我的部队也因此而士气大落。如果这次你能选我做决斗的助手，我的部下想必会安下心来。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="这时，在他们上方突然响起一阵雷鸣般的声音，这是巨人韦姆布威热那傻乎乎的笑声。直到雷佩契普狠狠地瞪了他一眼，他才意识到自己的失态，立即闭上嘴，憋出一脸苦相。">查看中文翻译</div>
