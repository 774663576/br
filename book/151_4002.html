<div class="line_en">"Hey," he said back. He wasn't using his PlayStation or reading a comic book. He was just lying in his bed looking at the ceiling. Daisy, as always, was next to him on the bed, her head draped over his legs. The Bleeding Scream costume was crumpled up on the floor next to the Boba Fett costume.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嗨。”他回答。他没有打电子游戏，也没有看漫画书，只是径自躺在床上盯着天花板。黛西像往常一样依偎在他身边，头枕在他大腿上。骷髅幽灵服在地板上皱成一团，旁边是波巴·费特的道具服。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At seven o'clock that night, I knocked on his door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="晚上七点钟，我敲他的门。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Hey," I said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嗨。”我说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm still nauseous."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“还有点恶心。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">August said he wasn't feeling well enough to go trick-or-treating later in the afternoon, which was sad for him because I know how much he loved to trick-or-treat -- especially after it got dark outside. Even though I was well beyond the trick-or-treating stage myself, I usually threw on some mask or other to accompany him up and down the blocks, watching him knocking on people's doors, giddy with excitement. I knew it was the one night a year when he could truly be like every other kid. No one knew he was different under the mask. To August, that must have felt absolutely amazing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="下午晚些时候，奥古斯特说他感觉不舒服，不能出去玩“不给糖就捣蛋”了。这对他来说实在太糟糕了，因为我知道他有多么喜欢玩这个游戏——尤其在天黑了以后。虽然我自己早已经过了玩“不给糖就捣蛋”的年龄，但我通常还是会随便扣上一张面具什么的，陪他满街区来来回回地跑，看着他挨家挨户地敲门，兴奋得晕头转向。我知道一年之中只有这一天他可以真的和别的孩子一样。没有人认识面具之下的那个他。对奥古斯特来说，那感觉绝对超赞。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"How's your stomach?" I said, sitting next to him on the bed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你肚子怎么样？”我挨着他在床边坐下来，问道。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“老师？作业？朋友？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And he told me what happened. He had overheard some very mean things some boys were saying about him. He didn't care about what the other boys had said, he expected that, but he was hurt that one of the boys was his "best friend" Jack Will. I remembered his mentioning Jack a couple of times over the past few months. I remembered Mom and Dad saying he seemed like a really nice kid, saying they were glad August had already made a friend like that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他一五一十地跟我说了。他无意中偷听到几个男生在说他的坏话。他不在乎别的男孩说什么，他能料到他们说什么，让他受伤害的，是其中一个叫杰克·威尔的男孩，他是他“最好的朋友”。我想起来过去这几个月里他提到杰克好几次。我还记得妈妈和爸爸说他看起来是一个相当不错的孩子，还说他们很高兴奥古斯特交到了那样的朋友。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Positive."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“确定。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You want to tell me what's up?" I said, sounding a bit like Mom.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你愿意跟我说说怎么回事吗？”我说，听起来有点像妈妈的口吻。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Did someone say something?" I asked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“有人说了什么吗？”我问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"People always say something," he answered bitterly. I could tell he was close to crying.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“人们总是说三道四。”他痛苦地回答。看得出来，他快要哭出来了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This surprised me. Usually August was such a trouper about his medical issues, whether it was skateboarding a few days after a surgery or sipping food through a straw when his mouth was practically bolted shut. This was a kid who's gotten more shots, taken more medicines, put up with more procedures by the age of ten than most people would have to put up with in ten lifetimes, and he was sidelined from a little nausea?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这让我非常吃惊。奥古斯特在他的治疗问题上向来不屈不挠，不管是手术过后才几天就去滑滑板，还是嘴巴几乎被封锁起来就用吸管一点一点地进食。这个孩子在十岁前所打的针、吃的药、经受的疗程比大多数人十辈子所经受的还要多，如今一点点恶心就让他打退堂鼓？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Then why would he say it? He's been pretending to be my friend all along. Tushman probably bribed him with good grades or something. I bet you he was like, hey, Jack, if you make friends with the freak, you don't have to take any tests this year."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可是他为什么要那么说？他一直都假装是我的朋友。图什曼也许用好成绩什么的收买了他。我打赌他大概是这么说的，嗨，杰克，如果你跟那个怪胎做朋友，今年你就不必参加任何考试了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I didn't say anything. I didn't know what to say. He was hurt. He was mad.</div>
