<div class="line_en">The enchanted ceiling of the Great Hall was dark and scattered with stars, and below it the four long House tables were lined with disheveled students, some in traveling cloaks, others in dressing gowns. Here and there shone the pearly white figures of the school ghosts. Every eye, living and dead, was fixed upon Professor McGonagall, who was speaking from the raised platform at the top of the Hall. Behind her stood the remaining teachers, including the palomino centaur, Firenze, and the members of the Order of the Phoenix who had arrived to fight.</div>

The Slytherin table was completely deserted, but a number of older Ravenclaws remained seated while their fellows filed out; even more Hufflepuffs stayed behind, and half of Gryffindor remained in their seats, necessitating Professor McGonagall's descent from the teachers' platform to chivvy the underage on their way.</div>

<div class="line_en">Before Harry could speak, there was a massive movement. The Gryffindors in front of him had risen and stood facing, not Harry, but the Slytherins.

<div class="line_en">He sensed eyes following him as he ran out of the Great Hall again, into the entrance hall still crowded with evacuating students. He allowed himself to be swept up the marble staircase with them, but at the top he hurried off along a deserted corridor. Fear and panic were clouding his thought processes. He tried to calm himself, to concentrate on finding the Horcrux, but his thoughts buzzed as frantically and fruitlessly as wasps trapped beneath a glass. Without Ron and Hermione to help him he could not seem to marshal his ideas. He slowed down, coming to a halt halfway along an empty passage, where he sat down upon the plinth of a departed statue and pulled the Marauder's Map out of the pouch around his neck. He could not see Ron's or Hermione's names anywhere on it, though the density of the crowd of dots now making its way to the Room of Requirement might, he thought, be concealing them. He put the map away, pressed his hands over his face, and closed his eyes, trying to concentrate…</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="没错，这是一个可靠的事实，就从那里开始。伏地魔派阿莱克托·卡罗驻守在拉文克劳公共休息室，这只能有一个解释：伏地魔担心哈利已经知道他的魂器跟那个学院有关。">查看中文翻译</div>

The sound of hundreds of people marching toward the Room of Requirement grew louder and louder as he returned to the marble stairs. Prefects were shouting instructions, trying to keep track of the students in their own Houses; there was much pushing and shoving; Harry saw Zacharias Smith bowling over first-years to get to the front of the queue; here and there younger students were in tears, while older ones called desperately for friends or siblings…</div>

<div class="line_en">There was silence, apart from panting and coughing. Then a number of huge bangs shook the castle, and a great cavalcade of transparent figures galloped past on horses, their heads screaming with bloodlust under their arms. Harry staggered to his feet when the Headless Hunt had passed and looked around: The battle was still going on all around him. He could hear more screams than those of the retreating ghosts. Panic flared within him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="沉默，只听见喘气和咳嗽声。接着一连串砰砰的巨响，震得整个城堡都在颤抖，一支由透明的人影组成的浩浩荡荡的队伍，骑着马飞奔而过，他们的脑袋夹在胳膊底下，还在杀气腾腾地呐喊着。无头猎手队经过后，哈利摇摇晃晃地站起来，打量着四周：战斗还在进行。除了刚才那些撤退的幽灵，他还听到更多的人在喊叫。他的内心恐慌极了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He pulled the diadem from his wrist and held it up. It was still hot, blackened with soot, but as he looked at it closely he was just able to make out the tiny words etched upon it: Wit beyond measure is man's greatest treasure.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他把冠冕从手腕上褪下来举在手里。冠冕还是滚烫的，上面沾满黑色的烟灰，但他仔细看时，勉强辨认出了上面刻着的细小的文字：过人的聪明才智是人类最大的财宝。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The air exploded. They had been grouped together, Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, and Percy, the two Death Eaters at their feet, one Stunned, the other Transfigured; and in that fragment of a moment, when danger seemed temporarily at bay, the world was rent apart. Harry felt himself flying through the air, and all he could do was hold as tightly as possible to that thin stick of wood that was his one and only weapon, and shield his head in his arms: He heard the screams and yells of his companions without a hope of knowing what had happened to them --</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="空气突然爆炸了。他们刚才聚拢在一起，哈利、罗恩、赫敏、弗雷德、珀西，还有他们脚边的两个食死徒，一个中了昏迷咒，一个中了变形咒。在危险似乎暂未来临的一瞬间，世界被撕裂了。哈利觉得自己飞到了空中，他只能死死地抓住那根细细的木棍——他惟一的武器，并用双臂护住脑袋。他听见了同伴们的大喊和惨叫，却无法知道他们到底怎么了——">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You're joking, Perce!" shouted Fred as the Death Eater he was battling collapsed under the weight of three separate Stunning Spells. Thicknesse had fallen to the ground with tiny spikes erupting all over him; he seemed to be turning into some form of sea urchin. Fred looked at Percy with glee.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你在开玩笑，珀西！”弗雷德喊道，跟他搏斗的那个食死徒在三个昏迷咒的重击下瘫倒了。辛克尼斯倒在地上，全身冒出许多小钉子，好像正在变成一种海胆。弗雷德高兴地看着珀西。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And then the world resolved itself into pain and semidarkness: He was half buried in the wreckage of a corridor that had been subjected to a terrible attack. Cold air told him that the side of the castle had been blown away, and hot stickiness on his cheek told him that he was bleeding copiously. Then he heard a terrible cry that pulled at his insides, that expressed agony of a kind neither flame nor curse could cause, and he stood up, swaying, more frightened than he had been that day, more frightened, perhaps, than he had been in his life…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后，世界渐渐化为疼痛和一片模糊：他半个身子都被废墟埋住了，走廊刚才遭到了可怕的袭击。寒冷的空气告诉他，城堡的一侧被炸飞了，面颊上热乎乎的、黏稠的感觉告诉他，他正在大量流血。接着，他听见一声令他揪心的惨叫，那叫声里所表达的痛苦，绝不是火焰或咒语能够引起的。哈利摇摇晃晃地站起身，心头极度，比他这一天、这一辈子的任何时候都要恐惧……">查看中文翻译</div>
