<div class="line_en">Let me tell you about the worst thing I have ever done. In 1975, as a twenty-year-old sophomore, I got a summer job as a research assistant in an animal behavior lab. One evening the professor gave me an assignment. Among the rats in the lab was a runt that could not participate in the ongoing studies, so he wanted to use it to try out a new experiment. The first step was to train the rat in what was called a temporal avoidance conditioning procedure. The floor of a Skinner box was hooked up to a shock generator, and a timer that would shock the animal every six seconds unless it pressed a lever, which would give it a ten-second reprieve. Rats catch on quickly and press the lever every eight or nine seconds, postponing the shock indefinitely. All I had to do was throw the rat in the box, start the timers, and go home for the night. When I arrived back at the lab early the next morning, I would find a fully conditioned rat.</div>

<div class="line_en">But that was not what looked back at me when I opened the box in the morning. The rat had a grotesque crook in its spine and was shivering uncontrollably. Within a few seconds, it jumped with a start. It was nowhere near the lever. I realized that the rat had not learned to press the lever and had spent the night being shocked every six seconds. When I reached in to rescue it, I found it cold to the touch. I rushed it to the veterinarian two floors down, but it was too late, and the rat died an hour later. I had tortured an animal to death.</div>

<div class="line_en">The resonance with certain episodes of 20th-century history is too close for comfort, and in the next chapter I will expand on the psychological lesson I learned that day. The reason I bring up this blot on my conscience is to show what was standard practice in the treatment of animals at the time. To motivate the animals to work for food, we starved them to 80 percent of their freefeeding weight, which in a small animal means a state of gnawing hunger. In the lab next door, pigeons were shocked through beaded keychains that were fastened around the base of their wings; I saw that the chains had worn right through their skin, exposing the muscle below. In another lab, rats were shocked through safety pins that pierced the skin of their chests. In one experiment on endorphins, animals were given unavoidable shocks described in the paper as "extremely intense, just subtetanizing"-- that is, just short of the point where the animal's muscles would seize up in a state of tetanus. The callousness extended outside the testing chambers. One researcher was known to show his anger by picking up the nearest unused rat and throwing it against a wall. Another shared a cold joke with me: a photograph, printed in a scientific journal, of a rat that had learned to avoid shocks by lying on its furry back while pressing the food lever with its forepaw. The caption: "Breakfast in bed."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这次经历与20世纪的某些特定历史事件过于接近，实在令人无法安宁，我将在下一章展开我在那天得到的心理教训。我之所以告诉大家我良心上的纠结，是要说明当时对待动物的标准就是如此。为了刺激动物为得到食物而工作，我们让动物挨饿，直到体重降至标准喂养时的80%；对小型动物来说，这意味着连续不断的饥饿。在隔壁的实验室里，鸽子的翅膀上拴着能够放出电击的钥匙链，我看见链子磨破翅膀的皮肤，露出下面粉红的嫩肉。在另一个实验室，发射电波的安全别针就别在老鼠胸部的皮肤上。在一项有关内啡肽（安多芬）的实验中，动物要遭受严重电击；实验文件写明电击“极其强烈，出现强直”——就是说，电击之后，动物的肌肉立即出现强直性痉挛。人们的麻木甚至超出实验的需要。一位研究员为了发泄情绪，将手边没有参加实验的老鼠狠狠扔到墙上。另外一位研究员和我分享了冷酷的玩笑：一份科学刊物上刊登的老鼠照片，它已经学会了规避电击，正四脚朝天地躺着，用前爪按动食物控制杆。照片的文字说明是：“床上用早餐。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As the experiment was being explained to me, I had already sensed it was wrong. Even if the procedure had gone perfectly, the rat would have spent twelve hours in constant anxiety, and I had enough experience to know that laboratory procedures don't always go perfectly. My professor was a radical behaviorist, for whom the question "What is it like to be a rat?" was simply incoherent. But I was not, and there was no doubt in my mind that a rat could feel pain. The professor wanted me in his lab; I knew that if I refused, nothing bad would happen. But I carried out the procedure anyway, reassured by the ethically spurious but psychologically reassuring principle that it was standard practice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我刚刚看到实验指引时，已经感到有些不对头。即使整个过程进展完全顺利，这只老鼠也要在整整12个小时内一直处于紧张状态。我的教授是一位激进的行为主义者，对他来说，“作为一只老鼠会如何感觉”这样的问题根本就是扯淡。但我却不然，我从来没有怀疑过老鼠能够感觉痛苦。教授很想留用我，所以我知道如果我拒绝执行他的这个要求，对我也不会有任何不利的结果。但是我还是照本宣科地执行了他的指示，不仅在伦理上自我欺骗，而且在心理上假定这些都是标准程序。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I'm relieved to say that just five years later, indifference to the welfare of animals among scientists had become unthinkable, indeed illegal. Beginning in the 1980s, any use of an animal for research or teaching had to be approved by an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), and any scientist will confirm that these committees are not rubber stamps. The size of cages, the amount and quality of food and veterinary care, and the opportunities for exercise and social contact are strictly regulated. Researchers and their assistants must take a training course on the ethics of animal experimentation, attend a series of panel discussions, and pass an exam. Any experiment that would subject an animal to discomfort or distress is placed in a category governed by special regulations and must be justified by its likelihood of providing "a greater benefit to science and human welfare."</div>

<div class="line_en">The change in the treatment of laboratory animals is part of yet another rights revolution: the growing conviction that animals should not be subjected to unjustifiable pain, injury, and death. The revolution in animal rights is a uniquely emblematic instance of the decline of violence, and it is fitting that I end my survey of historical declines by recounting it. That is because the change has been driven purely by the ethical principle that one ought not to inflict suffering on a sentient being. Unlike the other Rights Revolutions, the movement for animal rights was not advanced by the affected parties themselves: the rats and pigeons were hardly in a position to press their case. Nor has it been a by-product of commerce, reciprocity, or any other positive-sum negotiation; the animals have nothing to offer us in exchange for our treating them more humanely. And unlike the revolution in children's rights, it does not hold out the promise of an improvement in the makeup of its beneficiaries later in life. The recognition of animal interests was taken forward by human advocates on their behalf, who were moved by empathy, reason, and the inspiration of the other Rights Revolutions. Progress has been uneven, and certainly the animals themselves, if they could be asked, would not allow us to congratulate ourselves too heartily just yet. But the trends are real, and they are touching every aspect of our relationship with our fellow animals.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="实验室动物待遇的变化是权利运动的一个组成部分，人们日渐感到动物不应该遭受不必要的痛苦、伤害和死亡。动物权利的革命是暴力下降的独特象征，对这一革命的回顾正好适合作为我对暴力历史性下降的总结。因为驱动这场革命是一个纯粹的伦理原则，即任何人不应对其他有感知的生命制造痛苦。与其他权利革命不同，动物权利运动不是由受害人推动的，老鼠和鸽子完全无法提出申诉；也不是任何商业利益、互惠条款或者“正和协商”（Positive-Sum Negotiation）的副产品，动物不会因为我们的慈悲对待就提供任何东西与我们做交换。与儿童权利革命不同，动物权利革命不能保证对动物以后的生活有积极的影响。人类纯粹是受到同情、理性和其他权利革命的启发，以动物的名义承认了动物的利益。当然，进步是不均衡的，至少如果我们能够征求动物的意见，它们绝不会同意我们现在就开始扬扬自得。但是进步的趋势相当明显，已经影响到我们和与动物伙伴之间关系的方方面面。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Killing animals to eat their flesh is a part of the human condition. Our ancestors have been hunting, butchering, and probably cooking meat for at least two million years, and our mouths, teeth, and digestive tracts are specialized for a diet that includes meat. The fatty acids and complete protein in meat enabled the evolution of our metabolically expensive brains, and the availability of meat contributed to the evolution of human sociality. The jackpot of a felled animal gave our ancestors something of value to share or trade and set the stage for reciprocity and cooperation, because a lucky hunter with more meat than he could consume on the spot had a reason to share it, with the expectation that he would be the beneficiary when fortunes reversed. And the complementary contributions of hunted meat from men and gathered plants from women created synergies that bonded men and women for reasons other than the obvious ones. Meat also provided men with an efficient way to invest in their offspring, further strengthening family ties.</div>

<div class="line_en">The ecological importance of meat over evolutionary time left its mark in the psychological importance of meat in human lives. Meat tastes good, and eating it makes people happy. Many traditional cultures have a word for meat hunger, and the arrival of a hunter with a carcass was an occasion for village-wide rejoicing. Successful hunters are esteemed and have better sex lives, sometimes by dint of their prestige, sometimes by explicit exchanges of the carnal for the carnal. And in most cultures, a meal does not count as a feast unless meat is served.</div>

<div class="line_en">With meat so important in human affairs, it's not surprising that the welfare of the entities whose bodies provide that meat has been low on the list of human priorities. The usual signals that mitigate violence among humans are mostly absent in animals: they are not close kin, they can't trade favors with us, and in most species they don't have faces or expressions that elicit our sympathy. Conservationists are often exasperated that people care only about the charismatic mammals lucky enough to have faces to which humans respond, like grinning dolphins, sad-eyed pandas, and baby-faced juvenile seals. Ugly species are on their own.</div>

The Masai regularly bleed their cattle and mix the blood with milk for a delicious beverage, and Asian nomads cut chunks of fat from the tails of living sheep that they have specially bred for that purpose. Pets too are treated harshly: a recent cross-cultural survey found that half the traditional cultures that keep dogs as pets kill them, usually for food, and more than half abuse them. Among the Mbuti of Africa, for example, "the hunting dogs, valuable as they are, get kicked around mercilessly from the day they are born to the day they die."

<div class="line_en">The early civilizations that depended on domesticated livestock often had elaborate moral codes on the treatment of animals, but the benefits to the animal were mixed at best. The overriding principle was that animals exist for the benefit of humans. In the Hebrew Bible, God's first words to Adam and Eve in Genesis 1:28 are "Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth." Though Adam and Eve were frugivores, after the flood the human diet switched to meat. God told Noah in Genesis 9:2-3: "The fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered. Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things." Until the destruction of the second temple by the Romans in 70 CE, vast numbers of animals were slaughtered by Hebrew priests, not to nourish the people but to indulge the superstition that God had to be periodically placated with a well-done steak. (The smell of charbroiled beef, according to the Bible, is "a soothing aroma" and "a sweet savor" to God.)</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="依赖家养牲畜的早期文明对如何对待动物有详尽的道德准则，但即使在最善良的情况下，这些准则对动物也是好坏参半。最基本的原则是，动物是为了人类的利益而存在的。在希伯来人的《圣经·创世记》第1章第28节中，上帝对亚当和夏娃所说的第一句话是：“要生养众生，遍满地面，治理这地；也要管理海里的鱼、空中的鸟和地上各样行动的活物。”虽然亚当和夏娃还是食果灵长类，但大洪水之后，人类开始吃肉了。上帝在《创世记》第9章第2节和第3节中对诺亚说：“凡地上的走兽和空中的飞鸟，都必惊恐、惧怕你们；连地上一切的昆虫并海里一切的鱼，都交付你们的手。凡活着的动物，都可以作你们的食物，这一切我都赐给你们，如同菜蔬一样。”直到罗马人在公元70年摧毁第二圣殿时，希伯来神父每天宰杀大量动物，不是为了供养人，而是因为他们迷信必须向上帝定期供奉烧熟的牛排。（据《圣经》记载，炭烧牛肉的气味，对上帝来说是“馨香之气”。）">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ancient Greece and Rome had a similar view of the place of animals in the scheme of things. Aristotle wrote that "plants are created for the sake of animals, and the animals for the sake of man." Greek scientists put this attitude into practice by dissecting live mammals, including, occasionally, Homo sapiens. (According to the Roman medical writer Celsus, physicians in Hellenic Alexandria "procured criminals out of prison by royal permission, and dissecting them alive, contemplated, while they were yet breathing, the parts which nature had before concealed.") The Roman anatomist Galen wrote that he preferred to work with pigs rather than monkeys because of the "unpleasant expression" on the monkeys' faces when he cut into them. His compatriots, of course, delighted in the torture and slaughter of animals in the Colosseum, again not excluding a certain bipedal primate. In Christendom, Saints Augustine and Thomas Aquinas combined biblical with Greek views to ratify the amoral treatment of animals. Aquinas wrote, "By the divine providence [animals] are intended for man's use… Hence it is not wrong for man to make use of them, either by killing or in any other way whatsoever."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="古希腊人和古罗马人对动物在世间的排序持相近的看法。亚里士多德写过：“植物为了动物而生，动物则为了人而生。”希腊的科学家抱着这样的态度对哺乳动物进行活体解剖，有时候，他们甚至对人类做同样的事情。［根据古罗马医学著作的作者塞尔苏斯（Celsus），希腊亚历山大时期的“医生可以得到王家许可，从监狱采买罪犯，在罪犯活着的时候进行解剖，趁着犯人仍在呼吸，观察器官的工作，直到生命结束。”］罗马解剖学家盖伦（Galen）这样写过，他更愿意解剖猪而不是猴子，因为当他下刀子的时候，猴子的面部表露出“不愉快的神情”。当然，他的同胞们正在斗兽场欢乐地虐待和杀戮动物，甚至不排除虐待和杀戮双足行走的灵长类。在基督教世界，圣奥古斯丁和托马斯·阿奎那综合了《圣经》和希腊人的观点，确立了人类在对待动物时的道德超然立场。阿奎那写道：“据神圣的天意，（动物）存在的目的就是为人所用…因此，不论是杀死还是其他什么方式，人只要利用了动物，都不算是错误。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When it came to the treatment of animals, modern philosophy got off to a bad start. Descartes wrote that animals were clockwork, so there was no one home to feel pain or pleasure. What sound to us like cries of distress were merely the output of a noisemaker, like a warning buzzer on a machine. Descartes knew that the nervous systems of animals and humans were similar, so from our perspective it's odd that he could grant consciousness to humans while denying it to animals. But Descartes was committed to the existence of the soul, granted to humans by God, and the soul was the locus of consciousness. When he introspected on his own consciousness, he wrote, he could not "distinguish in myself any parts, but apprehend myself to be clearly one and entire… The faculties of willing, feeling, conceiving, etc. cannot be properly speaking said to be its parts, for it is one and the same mind which employs itself in willing and in feeling and understanding." Language too is a faculty of this indivisible thing we call mind or soul. Since animals lack language, they must lack souls; hence they must be without consciousness. A human has a clockwork body and brain, like an animal, but also a soul, which interacts with the brain through a special structure, the pineal gland.</div>

<div class="line_en">From the standpoint of modern neuroscience, the argument is loopy. Today we know that consciousness depends, down to the last glimmer and itch, on the physiological activity of the brain. We also know that language can be dissociated from the rest of consciousness, most obviously in stroke patients who have lost their ability to speak but have not been turned into insensate robots. But aphasia would not be documented until 1861 (by Descartes' compatriot Paul Broca), and the theory sounded plausible enough at the time. For centuries live animals would be dissected in medical laboratories, encouraged by the church's disapproval of the dissection of human cadavers. Scientists cut the limbs off living animals to see if they would regenerate, drew out their bowels, pulled off their skin, and removed their organs, including their eyes.</div>

Prelapsarian, pagan, and blood-and-soil creeds can depict the elaborate process of procuring and preparing animals as a decadent artifice, and vegetarianism as a wholesome living off the land.

Even Ivy League university students are vulnerable to the illusion.

<div class="line_en">Finally, since different subcultures treat animals in different ways, a moralistic concern with how the other guy treats his animals (while ignoring the way we do) can be a form of social one-upmanship. Blood sports in particular offer satisfying opportunities for class warfare, as when the middle class lobbies to outlaw the cockfighting enjoyed by the lower classes and the foxhunts enjoyed by the upper ones. Thomas Macaulay's remark that "the Puritan hated bearbaiting, not because it gave pain to the bear, but because it gave pleasure to the spectators' can mean that campaigns against violence tend to target the mindset of cruelty rather than just the harm to victims.

<div class="line_en">The Jewish dietary laws are an ancient example of the confused motives behind taboos on meat. Leviticus and Deuteronomy present the laws as unadorned diktats, since God is under no obligation to justify his commandments to mere mortals. But according to later rabbinical interpretations, the laws foster a concern with animal welfare, if only by forcing Jews to stop and think about the fact that the source of their meat is a living thing, ultimately belonging to God. Animals must be dispatched by a professional slaughterer who severs the animal's carotid artery, trachea, and esophagus with a clean swipe of a nick-free knife. This indeed may have been the most humane technology of the time, and was certainly better than cutting parts off a living animal or roasting it alive. But it is far from a painless death, and some humane societies today have sought to ban the practice. The commandment not to "seethe a kid in its mother's milk," the basis for the prohibition of mixing meat with dairy products, has also been interpreted as an expression of compassion for animals. But when you think about it, it's really an expression of the sensibilities of the observer. To a kid that is about to be turned into stewing meat, the ingredients of the sauce are the least of its concerns.</div>

<div class="line_en">Cultures that have gone all the way to vegetarianism are also driven by a mixture of motives. In the 6th century BCE Pythagoras started a cult that did more than measure the sides of triangles: he and his followers avoided meat, largely because they believed in the transmigration of souls from body to body, including those of animals. Before the word vegetarian was coined in the 1840s, an abstention from meat and fish was called "the Pythagorean diet." The Hindus too based their vegetarianism on the doctrine of reincarnation, though cynical anthropologists like Marvin Harris have offered a more prosaic explanation: cattle in India were more precious as plow animals and dispensers of milk and dung (used as fuel and fertilizer) than they would have been as the main ingredient in beef curry. The spiritual rationale of Hindu vegetarianism was carried over into Buddhism and Jainism, though with a more explicit concern for animals rooted in a philosophy of nonviolence. Jain monks sweep the ground in front of them so as not to tread on insects, and some wear masks to avoid killing microbes by inhaling them.</div>

<div class="line_en">But any intuition that vegetarianism and humanitarianism go together was shattered in the 20th-century by the treatment of animals under Nazism. Hitler and many of his henchmen were vegetarians, not so much out of compassion for animals as from an obsession with purity, a pagan desire to reconnect to the soil, and a reaction to the anthropocentrism and meat rituals of Judaism. In an unsurpassed display of the human capacity for moral compartmentalization, the Nazis, despite their unspeakable experiments on living humans, instituted the strongest laws for the protection of animals in research that Europe had ever seen. Their laws also mandated humane treatment of animals in farms, movie sets, and restaurants, where fish had to be anesthetized and lobsters killed swiftly before they were cooked. Ever since that bizarre chapter in the history of animal rights, advocates of vegetarianism have had to retire one of their oldest arguments: that eating meat makes people aggressive, and abstaining from it makes them peaceful.</div>

<div class="line_en">And as we saw in chapter 4, Jeremy Bentham's laser-beam analysis of morality led him to pinpoint the issue that should govern our treatment of animals: not whether they can reason or talk, but whether they can suffer. By the early 19th century, the Humanitarian Revolution had been extended from humans to other sentient beings, first targeting the most conspicuous form of sadism toward animals, blood sports, followed by the abuse of beasts of burden, livestock on farms, and laboratory animals. When the first of these measures, a ban on the abuse of horses, was introduced into the British Parliament in 1821, it elicited howls of laughter from MPs who said that it would lead to the protection of dogs and even cats. Within two decades that is exactly what happened. Throughout 19th-century Britain, a blend of humanitarianism and romanticism led to antivivisection leagues, vegetarian movements, and societies for the prevention of cruelty to animals. Biologists' acceptance of the theory of evolution following the publication of The Origin of Species in 1859 made it impossible for them to maintain that consciousness was unique to humans, and by the end of the century in Britain, they had acceded to laws banning vivisection.</div>

The austerity from the two world wars had created a meat hunger, and the populace was so grateful for the flood of cheap meat from factory farming that it gave little thought to where the meat came from. Also, beginning in the nineteen-teens, behaviorism took over psychology and philosophy and decreed that the very idea of animal experience was a form of unscientific naïveté: the cardinal sin of anthropomorphism.

<div class="line_en">All this changed in the 1970s. The plight of livestock in factory farms was brought to light in Britain in a 1964 book by Ruth Harrison called Animal Machines. Other public figures soon took up the cause. Brigid Brophy has been credited with the term animal rights, which she deliberately coined by analogy: she wanted to associate "the case for non-human animals with that clutch of egalitarian or libertarian ideas which have sporadically, though quite often with impressively actual political results, come to the rescue of other oppressed classes, such as slaves or homosexuals or women."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="直到20世纪70年代，情况才发生了变化。1964年英国出版了露丝·哈里森（Ruth Harrison）的《动物机器》（Animal Machines），向公众揭露了工厂化饲养中的禽畜的悲惨处境。公众人物迅速响应，据信小说家布丽吉德·布罗菲（Brigid Brophy）首先提出了“动物权利”说，她刻意将两者进行类比，说她就是想“在非人类的动物世界引进平等和解放这样的观念，虽然这些理想只是偶尔能够美梦成真，但一旦成功，通常都带有令人难忘的实际政治成果，比如让奴隶、同性恋或妇女这些受压迫的阶级得到拯救”。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The real turning point was the philosopher Peter Singer's 1975 book Animal Liberation, the so-called bible of the animal rights movement. The sobriquet is doubly ironic because Singer is a secularist and a utilitarian, and utilitarians have been skeptical of natural rights ever since Bentham called the idea "nonsense on stilts." But following Bentham, Singer laid out a razor-sharp argument for a full consideration of the interests of animals, while not necessarily granting them "rights." The argument begins with the realization that it is consciousness rather than intelligence or species membership that makes a being worthy of moral consideration. It follows that we should not inflict avoidable pain on animals any more than we should inflict it on young children or the mentally handicapped. And a corollary is that we should all be vegetarians. Humans can thrive on a modern vegetarian diet, and animals' interests in a life free of pain and premature death surely outweigh the marginal increase in pleasure we get from eating their flesh. The fact that humans "naturally" eat meat, whether by cultural tradition, biological evolution, or both, is morally irrelevant.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="真正的转折点是哲学家彼得·辛格1975年的著作《动物解放》（Animal Liberation），人们称其为“动物权利运动的圣经”。这里所谓“圣经”的叫法有双重的讥讽含义：辛格是一个世俗主义者和一个功利主义者。自边沁将自然权利称为“高跷上的胡言乱语”以来，功利主义者对这一观念就充满怀疑。但是，辛格追随边沁，对动物的利益给出了清晰的阐述，却没有赋予它们任何“权利”。他首先认识到，生命的感受，而不是智商或者物种的成员地位，决定其是否值得伦理考量。接着，他认为，我们不应该对动物制造任何可以避免的痛苦，就如同我们不能对孩子和有精神障碍的人制造痛苦是一样的道理。他推论说，所有的人都应该素食。人类完全可以依赖现代素食食谱而生存，权衡利害，动物作为生命免除痛苦和夭折的重要性，显然要高于人类从肉食中得到的微末快感。无论是在文化传统上还是在生物进化上，或者两者兼而有之，人类“天然”摄取肉食的事实都不能说明其在伦理上的天然正当性。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Like Brophy, Singer made every effort to analogize the animal welfare movement to the other Rights Revolutions of the 1960s and 1970s. The analogy began with his title, an allusion to colonial liberation, women's liberation, and gay liberation, and it continued with his popularization of the term speciesism, a sibling of racism and sexism. Singer quoted an 18th-century critic of the feminist writer Mary Wollstonecraft who argued that if she was right about women, we would also have to grant rights to "brutes." The critic had intended it as a reductio ad absurdum, but Singer argued that it was a sound deduction. For Singer, these analogies are far more than rhetorical techniques. In another book, The Expanding Circle, he advanced a theory of moral progress in which human beings were endowed by natural selection with a kernel of empathy toward kin and allies, and have gradually extended it to wider and wider circles of living things, from family and village to clan, tribe, nation, species, and all of sentient life. The book you are reading owes much to this insight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="辛格的书取名“动物解放”，与布罗菲一样，辛格极力要将动物权利运动与60、70年代的权利革命——殖民地解放、妇女解放、同性恋解放相类比，他创造的流行字眼“物种歧视”（speciesism），成为“种族歧视”和“性别歧视”的姊妹词。辛格引用18世纪女权作家玛丽·沃斯通克拉夫特的言论，说如果玛丽关于妇女权利的论述是正确的，那么我们也必须给予“野兽”权利。玛丽的论述是一种归谬法，但辛格认为它是一个完整的演绎。对辛格来说，这些类比绝非简单的修辞技巧。他在另外一本论著《扩大的圈子》（The Expanding Circle）中发展了道德进步理论。他说，人类在自然选择中被授予能够对血亲和同伴移情的内在能力，这种移情的生命圈逐渐扩张，从家庭、村庄扩展到整个族群、部落、国家和物种，甚至扩展到所有有感知的生命。我能写作此书，也是得益于辛格的见解。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Singer's moral arguments were not the only forces that made people sympathetic to animals. In the 1970s it was a good thing to be a socialist, fruit-juice drinker, nudist, sandal-wearer, sex-maniac, Quaker, Nature Cure quack, pacifist, and feminist, sometimes all at the same time. The compassion-based argument for vegetarianism was soon fortified with other arguments: that meat was fattening, toxic, and artery-hardening; that growing crops to feed animals rather than people was a waste of land and food; and that the effluvia of farm animals was a major pollutant, particularly methane, the greenhouse gas that comes out of both ends of a cow.</div>

<div class="line_en">I've already mentioned the first: the protection of animals in laboratories. Not only are live animals now protected from being hurt, stressed, or killed in the conduct of science, but in high school biology labs the venerable custom of dissecting pickled frogs has gone the way of inkwells and slide rules. (In some schools it has been replaced by V-Frog, a virtual reality dissection program.) And in commercial laboratories the routine use of animals to test cosmetics and household products has come under fire. Since the 1940s, following reports of women being blinded by mascara containing coal tar, many household products have been tested for safety with the infamous Draize procedure, which applies a compound to the eyes of rabbits and looks for signs of damage. Until the 1980s few people had heard of the Draize test, and until the 1990s few would have recognized the term cruelty-free, the designation for products that avoid it. Today the term is emblazoned on thousands of consumer goods and has become familiar enough that the label "cruelty-free condoms' does not raise an eyebrow. Animal testing in consumer product labs continues, but has been increasingly regulated and reduced.</div>

<div class="line_en">Even the proud bullfight has been threatened. In 2004 the city of Barcelona outlawed the deadly contests between matador and beast, and in 2010 the ban was extended to the entire region of Catalonia. The state-run Spanish television network had already ended live coverage of bullfights because they were deemed too violent for children. The European Parliament has considered a continent-wide ban as well. Like formal dueling and other violent customs sanctified by pomp and ceremony, bullfighting may eventually bite the dust, not because compassion condemns it or governments outlaw it, but because detraction will not suffer it. In his 1932 book Death in the Afternoon, Ernest Hemingway explained the primal appeal of the bullfight:</div>

<div class="line_en">[The matador] must have a spiritual enjoyment of the moment of killing. Killing cleanly and in a way which gives you esthetic pleasure and pride has always been one of the greatest enjoyments of a part of the human race. Once you accept the rule of death, "Thou shalt not kill" is an easily and naturally obeyed commandment. But when a man is still in rebellion against death he has pleasure in taking to himself one of the godlike attributes, that of giving it. This is one of the most profound feelings in those men who enjoy killing. These things are done in pride and pride, of course, is a Christian sin and a pagan virtue.

<div class="line_en">And finally we get to meat. If someone were to count up every animal that has lived on earth in the past fifty years and tally the harmful acts done to them, he or she might argue that no progress has been made in the treatment of animals. The reason is that the Animal Rights Revolution has been partly canceled out by another development, the Broiler Chicken Revolution. The 1928 campaign slogan "A chicken in every pot" reminds us that chicken was once thought of as a luxury. The market responded by breeding meatier chickens and raising them more efficiently, if less humanely: factory-farmed chickens have spindly legs, live in cramped cages, breathe fetid air, and are handled roughly when transported and slaughtered. In the 1970s consumers became convinced that white meat was healthier than red (a trend exploited by the National Pork Board when it came up with the slogan "The Other White Meat"). And since poultry are smallbrained creatures from a different biological class, many people have a vague sense that they are less fully conscious than mammals. The result was a massive increase in the demand for chicken, surpassing, by the early 1990s, the demand for beef. The unintended consequence was that billions more unhappy lives had to be brought into being and snuffed out to meet the demand, because it takes two hundred chickens to provide the same amount of meat as a single cow. Now, factory farming and cruel treatment of poultry and livestock go back centuries, so the baleful trend was not a backsliding of moral sensibilities or an increase in callousness. It was a stealthy creeping up of the numbers, driven by changes in economics and taste, which had gone undetected because a majority of people had always been incurious about the lives of chickens. The same is true, to a lesser extent, of the animals that provide us with the other white meat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后，我们来说说肉类。如果你要数一数50年来生活在这个世界上的每一个动物，将对动物的伤害做个总计，你会说，人类在对待动物方面毫无改进。因为动物权利革命的进步被肉用仔鸡革命的进展抵消了。1928年总统竞选口号“每只锅里一只鸡”告诉我们，鸡曾经被视为奢侈品。市场的反应就是培育肉质更多的品种，进行更有效的饲养，尽管可能更不人道：工厂化饲养的肉鸡双腿细小，鸡笼拥挤不堪，呼吸的是腥臭的空气，运输和屠宰的手法都非常粗暴。20世纪70年代，消费者开始相信白肉比红肉更健康［“国家猪肉委员会”不失时机地提出口号“（猪肉）另外一种白肉”］。因为禽类的大脑非常之小，与人属于不同的物种类别，人们模模糊糊地认为，禽类比哺乳类缺少感觉的能力。于是，对鸡肉的消费需求暴涨，到90年代初鸡肉的消费超过了牛肉。一个人们原来没有预料到的结果就是，为了满足消费者，数十亿的悲惨生灵先是被带进这个世界，然后又被杀死，因为要两百只鸡才能顶得上一头牛所提供的肉量。工厂化饲养家禽，以及虐待家禽和牲畜已有几百年的历史，趋势恶化并非因为道德滑坡，也不是人们的心肠变得更粗糙了。饲养的数量在人们未注意之际不断攀升，动力是经济利益和人们口味的变化，人们之所以对饲养数量毫无察觉，是因为他们从来就不曾对鸡的生活有任何好奇心。此外，这些动物向我们提供的是如假包换的白肉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And if that is not enough to convince you that animal rights have been taken to a new level, consider the events of June 16, 2009, as recounted in a New York Times article entitled "What's White, Has 132 Rooms, and Flies?" The answer to the riddle is the White House, which had recently become infested with the bugs. During a televised interview a large fly orbited President Obama's head. When the Secret Service did not wrestle it to the ground, the president took matters into his own hands, using one of them to smack the fly on the back of the other. "I got the sucker," boasted the exterminator in chief. The footage became a YouTube sensation but drew a complaint from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. They noted on their blog, "It can't be said that President Obama wouldn't hurt a fly," and sent over one of their Katcha Bug Humane Bug Catchers "in the event of future insect incidents."</div>

<div class="line_en">But the tide has begun to turn. One sign is the increase in vegetarianism. I'm sure I was not the only dinner host in the 1990s to have had one of my guests announce as he sat down at the table, "Oh, I forgot to tell you. I don't eat dead animals." Since that era the question "Do you have any food restrictions?" has become a part of the etiquette of a dinner invitation, and participants at conference dinners can now tick a box that will replace a plate of rubber chicken with a plate of sodden eggplant. The trend was noted in 2002, when Time magazine ran a cover story entitled: "Should You Be a Vegetarian? Millions of Americans Are Going Meatless."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="潮流在90年代开始转向。标志之一是素食人群的扩大。我相信，许多人有和我一样的经历，请客吃饭时，一位刚刚坐上餐桌的客人宣布说：“哎呀，我忘记告诉你了。我不吃死的动物。”自那时起，事先征询客人“可有什么忌口吗？”成了请客用餐的礼节；参加会议晚宴的人也可以在菜单上打钩，用一盘浓香酱汁茄子替代一盘没滋少味的鸡肉。这股潮流终于成了气候，《时代周刊》2002年的一篇封面报道的标题是：“你应该成为素食者吗？数百万美国人不再吃肉了”。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The food industry has responded with a cornucopia of vegetarian and vegan products. The faux-meat section of my local supermarket offers Soyburgers, Gardenburgers, Seitanburgers, Veggie Burger Meatless Patties, Tofu Pups, Not Dogs, Smart Dogs, Fakin Bacon, Jerquee, Tofurky, Soy Sausage, Soyrizo, Chik Patties, Meatless Buffalo Wings, Celebration Roast, Tempeh Strips, Terkettes, Veggie Protein Slices, Vege-Scallops, and Tuno. The technological and verbal ingenuity is testimony both to the popularity of the new vegetarianism and to the persistence of ancient meat hunger. Those who enjoy a hearty breakfast can serve their Veggie Breakfast Strips with Tofu Scramblers, perhaps in an omelet with Soya Kaas, Soymage, or Veganrella. And for dessert there's Ice Bean, Rice Dream, and Tofutti, perhaps garnished with Hip Whip and a cherry on top. The ultimate replacement for meat would be animal tissue grown in culture, sometimes called meat without feet.

<div class="line_en">But is vegetarianism at least trending upward? As best we can tell, it is. In the U. K. the Vegetarian Society gathers up the results of every opinion poll it can find and presents the data on its information sheets. In figure 7-28 I've plotted the results of all the questions that ask a national sample of respondents whether they are vegetarians. The best-fitting straight line suggests that over the past two decades, vegetarianism has more than tripled, from about 2 percent of the population to about 7 percent. In the United States, the Vegetarian Resource Group has commissioned polling agencies to ask Americans the more stringent question of whether they eat meat, fish, or fowl, excluding the flexitarians and those with creative Linnaean taxonomies. The numbers are smaller, but the trend is similar, more than tripling in about fifteen years.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，素食主义至少仍处于上升趋势。在英国，“素食者学会”搜集了各种民调中问及素食的信息，汇编成表格。我使用他们的数据绘制了图7—28。图中笔直的上行线说明，过去20年中，英国的素食人数增加了3倍，从占人口的约2%上升到约7%。在美国，“素食资源小组”出资，民调机构提出相当严格的问题，询问受调查者是否食用肉、鱼或者禽类，排除了半素食者和那些创意无限的林奈式分类素食。美国的素食者数量要小，但趋势是一样的：在大约15年的时间里，素食人数增长了3倍。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For all the visibility of vegetarianism, pure vegetarians still make up just a few percentage points of the population. It's not easy being green. Vegetarians are surrounded by dead animals and the carnivores who love them, and meat hunger has not been bred out of them. It's not surprising that many fall off the wagon: at any moment there are three times as many lapsed vegetarians as observant ones. Many of those who continue to call themselves vegetarians have convinced themselves that a fish is a vegetable, because they partake of fish and seafood and sometimes even chicken. Others parse their dietary restrictions like Conservadox Jews in a Chinese restaurant, allowing themselves exemptions for narrowly defined categories or for food eaten outside the home. The demographic sector with the largest proportion of vegetarians is teenage girls, and their principal motive may not be compassion for animals. Vegetarianism among teenage girls is highly correlated with eating disorders.</div>

<div class="line_en">With all the signs of increasing concern with animal welfare, it may be surprising that the percentage of vegetarians, though rising, is still so low. But it really shouldn't be. Being a vegetarian and being concerned with animal welfare are not the same thing. Not only do vegetarians have motives other than animal welfare -- health, taste, ecology, religion, driving their mothers crazy -- but people who are concerned with animal welfare may wonder whether the symbolic statement of vegetarianism is the best way to reduce animal suffering. They may feel that the hamburgers they altruistically forgo are unlikely to register amid the noise in the vast national demand for meat or to lead to the sparing of the lives of any cows. And even if they did, the lives of the remaining cows would be no more pleasant. Changing the practices of the food industry is a collective action dilemma, in which individuals are tempted to shirk from private sacrifices that have marginal effects on aggregate welfare.</div>

<div class="line_en">The increase in vegetarianism, though, is a symbolic indicator of a broader concern for animals that can be seen in other forms. People who don't abstain from meat as a matter of principle may still eat less of it. (American consumption of meat from mammals has declined since 1980.) Restaurants and supermarkets increasingly inform their patrons about what their main course fed on and how freely it ranged while it was still on the hoof or claw. Two of the major poultry processors in the United States announced in 2010 that they were switching to a more humane method of slaughtering, in which the birds are knocked out by carbon dioxide before being hung by their feet to have their throats slit. The marketers have to walk a fine line. Diners are happy to learn that their entrée was humanely treated until its last breath, but they would rather not know the details of exactly how it met its end. And even the most humane technique has an image problem. As one executive said, "I don't want the public to say we gas our chickens."</div>

<div class="line_en">More significantly, a majority of people support legal measures that would solve the collective action problem by approving laws that force farmers and meatpackers to treat animals more humanely. In a 2000 poll 80 percent of Britons said "they would like to see better welfare conditions for Britain's farm animals." Even Americans, with their more libertarian temperament, are willing to empower the government to enforce such conditions. In a 2003 Gallup poll, a remarkable 96 percent of Americans said that animals deserve at least some protection from harm and exploitation, and only 3 percent said that they need no protection "since they are just animals." Though Americans oppose bans on hunting or on the use of animals in medical research and product testing, 62 percent support "strict laws concerning the treatment of farm animals." And when given the opportunity, they translate their opinions into votes. Livestock rights have been written into the laws of Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Maine, Michigan, Ohio, and Oregon, and in 2008, 63 percent of California voters approved the Prevention of Farm Animal Cruelty Act, which bans veal crates, poultry cages, and sow gestation crates that prevent the animal from moving around.

<div class="line_en">And perhaps as Europe goes, so goes California. The European Union has elaborate regulations on animal care "that start with the recognition that animals are sentient beings. The general aim is to ensure that animals need not endure avoidable pain or suffering and obliges the owner/keeper of animals to respect minimum welfare requirements." Not every country has gone so far as Switzerland, which enacted 150 pages of regulations that force dog owners to attend a four-hour "theory" course and legislate how pet owners may house, feed, walk, play with, and dispose of their pets. (No more flushing live goldfish down the toilet.) But even the Swiss balked at a 2010 referendum that would have nationalized a Zurich policy that pays an "animal advocate" to haul offenders into criminal court, including an angler who boasted to a local newspaper that he took ten minutes to land a large pike. (The angler was acquitted; the pike was eaten.) All this may sound like American conservatives' worst nightmare, but they too are willing to allow the government to regulate animal welfare. In the 2003 poll, a majority of Republicans favored passing "strict laws" on the treatment of farm animals.</div>

But the analogy is not exact -- African Americans, women, children, and gay people are not broiler chickens -- and I doubt that the trajectory of animal rights will be a time-lagged copy of the one for human rights.

<div class="line_en">One impediment is meat hunger and the social pleasures that go with the consumption of meat. Though traditional Hindus, Buddhists, and Jains prove that a meatless society is possible, the 3 percent market share of vegetarian diets in the United States shows that we are very far from a tipping point. While gathering the data for this chapter, I was excited to stumble upon a 2004 Pew Research poll in which 13 percent of the respondents were vegetarians. Upon reading the fine print, I discovered that it was a poll of supporters of the presidential candidacy of Howard Dean, the left-wing governor of Vermont. That means that even among the crunchiest granolas in Ben-and-Jerry land, 87 percent still eat meat. 300</div>

<div class="line_en">But the impediments run deeper than meat hunger. Many interactions between humans and animals will always be zero-sum. Animals eat our houses, our crops, and occasionally our children. They make us itch and bleed. They are vectors for diseases that torment and kill us. They kill each other, including endangered species that we would like to keep around. Without their participation in experiments, medicine would be frozen at its current state, and billions of living and unborn people would suffer and die for the sake of mice. An ethical calculus that gave equal weight to any harm suffered by any sentient being, allowing no chauvinism toward our own species, would prevent us from trading off the well-being of animals for an equivalent well-being of humans -- for example, shooting a wild dog to save a little girl. To be sure, the interests of humans could be given some extra points by virtue of our zoological peculiarities, such as that our big brains allow us to savor our lives, reflect on our past and future, dread death, and enmesh our well-being with those of others in dense social networks. But the human life taboo, which among other things protects the lives of mentally incompetent people just because they are people, would have to go. Singer himself unflinchingly accepts this implication of a species-blind morality. But it will not take over Western morality anytime soon.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，道德矛盾有比对肉食的渴望更深层的原因。人类和动物的许多互动只能是零和博弈。动物吃掉我们的房子、庄稼，有时甚至是我们的孩子。它们能弄得我们刺痒和流血。它们携带对人类有害甚至致命的细菌和病毒。它们互相残杀，甚至那些我们期望保留的濒临灭绝的动物也不例外。没有动物参与实验，医药将停滞在目前的水平上，数十亿活着和未出生的人将为了老鼠而忍受病痛与死亡。伦理计算认为，每一个有感知的生命所承受的痛苦的分量都是一样的，物种沙文主义是不能接受的，因此，我们不能牺牲动物来为人类谋福。比如，我们不可以为了救一个小女孩而射杀野狗。但是，仅仅从动物学特征上的优势看，也应该给予人类的利益更大的权重。比如，我们的大脑让我们能够尽情享受生活，思索我们的过去和未来，对死亡怀有恐惧，并在社交网络中将自己的幸福与其他人关联在一起。但是，按照这个逻辑，人类对生命的禁忌就没有意义了。正是因为这种禁忌，智力残缺的人的生命才受到保护。辛格本人毫不妥协地接受超越物种的道德观。但是，在最近的将来，这种道德观还无法取代西方的道德观。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ultimately the move toward animal rights will bump against some of the most perplexing enigmas in the space of human thoughts, a place where moral intuitions start to break down. One is the hard problem of consciousness, namely how sentience arises from neural information processing. Descartes was certainly wrong about mammals, and I am pretty sure he was wrong about fish. But was he wrong about oysters? Slugs? Termites? Earthworms? If we wanted ethical certainty in our cooking, gardening, home repair, and recreation, we would need nothing less than a solution to this philosophical conundrum. Another paradox is that human beings are simultaneously rational, moral agents and organisms that are part of nature red in tooth and claw. Something in me objects to the image of a hunter shooting a moose. But why am I not upset by the image of a grizzly bear that renders it just as dead? Why don't I think it's a moral imperative to tempt the bear away with all-soy meatless moose patties? Should we arrange for the gradual extinction of carnivorous species, or even genetically engineer them into herbivores? We recoil from these thought experiments because, rightly or wrongly, we assign some degree of ethical weight to what we feel is "natural." But if the natural carnivory of other species counts for something, why not the natural carnivory of Homo sapiens -- particularly if we deploy our cognitive and moral faculties to minimize the animals' suffering?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对动物权利的思考肯定会撞击人类思想领域某些最费解的谜，让道德直觉开始发生动摇。难题之一是意识，即感知是如何经过神经信息处理而产生的。笛卡儿对哺乳动物的认识肯定是错误的，我基本上相信他对鱼的认识也是错误的。但是他对于牡蛎的理解呢，对蜓蛐呢，还有白蚁，还有蚯蚓，也都错了吗？如果我们需要在烹调、园艺、房屋修缮和娱乐中保持伦理的确定性，我们必须回答这个哲学难题。我的另一个困惑是，人类是理性和道德的主体，但同时也是作为残忍大自然组成部分的生物体。我对猎人开枪射杀麋鹿的画面感到某种反感，但是，为什么我对凶狠的棕熊捕食麋鹿的画面却没有太多伤感？为什么我没有那种道德紧迫感，赶紧准备一些纯大豆制作的麋鹿风味馅饼，将棕熊从麋鹿身旁引诱走？我们是否应该安排食肉物种逐渐灭绝，或者通过基因工程将它们改造成食草物种？我们总是在这类思维实验中止步不前，因为无论对错，我们对我们感觉“自然”的东西总是给予更大的道德权重。但是，如果其他物种的自然肉食性可以接受，为什么人类的自然肉食性就不能接受呢？特别是我们人类还可以调动认知能力和道德能力尽量减少被食用动物的痛苦。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">These imponderables, I suspect, prevent the animal rights movement from duplicating the trajectory of the other Rights Revolutions exactly. But for now the location of the finish line is beside the point. There are many opportunities in which enormous suffering by animals can be reduced at a small cost to humans. Given the recent changes in sensibilities, it is certain that the lives of animals will continue to improve.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我猜想，这些无解的问题使得动物权利运动不可能完全复制其他权利运动的发展趋势。但至今为止，终点线在哪里无关紧要。我们还有很多机会，只要人类付出很少的代价，就可以大大地降低动物的痛苦。考虑到最近公众敏感性的变化，可以肯定，动物的生活质量将继续得到改善。">查看中文翻译</div>
