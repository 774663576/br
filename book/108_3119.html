<div class="line_en">As he marches down the stairs the next morning, he stops in the hallway. It hasn't smelled like this in the house since Sonja died. Watchfully he takes the last few steps down, lands on the parquet floor, and stands in the doorway of the kitchen, his body language that of a man who has just caught a thief red-handed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他迷惑地在楼梯中央停下脚步。自从索雅死后，屋子里还没出现过这样的味道。他格外谨慎地走完剩下的几级楼梯，脚轻轻落在木地板上，同时朝厨房的门洞里探着身子，那姿势就像在宣布自己捉了个贼。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sometimes it is difficult to explain why some men suddenly do the things they do. Sometimes, of course, it's because they know they'll do them sooner or later anyway, and so they may as well just do them now. And sometimes it's the pure opposite -- because they realize they should have done them long ago. Ove has probably known all along what he has to do, but all people at root are time optimists. We always think there's enough time to do things with other people. Time to say things to them. And then something happens and then we stand there holding on to words like "if."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有时候，人们那些突如其来的行为是很难理解的。有时候，当然，他们会想，反正早晚都要这么做，那么择日不如撞日，就趁现在了。有时候却恰恰相反，人们突然意识到，有些事早就该做了。欧维大概从来就知道自己到底该做什么，但对于时间，所有人都太乐观。我们相信总能腾出时间来与他人一起做想做的事，说想说的话。然后突然有一天，发生了什么意外，我们就只好站在那儿，脑海总盘旋着一个词：如果。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The cat looks as if it would like to rub itself lovingly against Jimmy's legs, but seems to change its mind, bearing in mind that the last time it did something similar Jimmy ended up in the hospital. Instead it opts for the next best available thing and rolls about in the snow. Jimmy turns to Ove.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“社保的人要把他带走了，你知道吗？”追上来后，吉米解释道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You know, the long and short of it is Anita applied for more home help. Rune is just past it and she couldn't deal with it anymore. So then the Social did some investigation and some guy called and said they'd decided she couldn't handle it. And they were going to put Rune in one of those institutions, you know. And then Anita said they could forget about it, she didn't even want home help anymore. But then that guy got really aggro and started getting totally uncool with her. Going on about how she couldn't take the investigation back now and she was the one who had asked them to look into it. And now the investigation had made a decision and that was all there was to it, you know. Doesn't matter what she says 'cos the Social guy is just running his own race, know what I mean?"</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“安妮塔不让我告诉你和索雅。是这样。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The silence that follows is so thick you could split it with an ax. Jimmy does not look up. And Ove doesn't say anything. He goes inside the trash room. Comes out. Goes into the bicycle shed. Comes out. The penny seems to have dropped. Jimmy's last words hang like a veil over his movements and an unfathomable anger builds up inside Ove, picking up speed like a tornado inside his chest. He tugs at doors with increasing violence. Kicks the thresholds. And when Jimmy in the end mumbles something about, "Now it's all screwed, man, now they'll put Rune in a home, you know," Ove slams a door so hard that the entire trash room shakes. He stands in silence with his back to them, panting more and more heavily.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="紧接着的沉默厚重得经得起刀劈斧凿。吉米没有抬起头。欧维什么都没说。他走进垃圾房，又走出来。走进自行车棚，又走出来。但他的身上起了变化。“钢镚儿掉下来了。”索雅总是这么说。吉米最后那句话，就像一层薄纱包裹住他的一举一动，心中无法平息的怒火在欧维胸口燃烧起来，越烧越旺，就像长了血栓。他摇摇门把手，踹踹门框，越来越用力。当吉米终于开口念叨起什么“就是现在了，他们马上就要来把鲁尼送去养老院了，你知道吗”，欧维砰地关上一扇门，整座垃圾房摇晃起来。他沉默地背对他们站在那里，呼吸越来越沉重。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="吉米惊慌地点头。欧维低下头，胸膛在外套下起伏着。他想索雅听到这一切会怎么想。要是知道她最好的朋友没向她求助，就因为她的“麻烦已经够多了”，索雅一定会心碎的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jimmy nods again. He opens his mouth to say something, but Ove has already started moving off. He makes off between the houses with the movements of a man about to take his revenge for a deadly injustice in a Western. Turns off at the house at the end of the road, where the trailer and the white Škoda are still parked, banging at the door with such force that it's difficult to tell whether it will open before he reduces it to wood chips. Anita opens, in shock. Ove steps right into her hall.</div>
