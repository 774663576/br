<div class="line_en">My daughter wanted to go to China for her second honeymoon, but now she is afraid. "What if I blend in so well they think I'm one of them?" Waverly asked me. "What if they don't let me come back to the United States?"</div>

<div class="line_en">My daughter did not look pleased when I told her this, that she didn't look Chinese. She had a sour American look on her face. Oh, maybe ten years ago, she would have clapped her hands -- hurray!-- as if this were good news. But now she wants to be Chinese, it is so fashionable. And I know it is too late. All those years I tried to teach her! She followed my Chinese ways only until she learned how to walk out the door by herself and go to school. So now the only Chinese words she can say are sh-sh, houche, chr fan, and gwan deng shweijyau. How can she talk to people in China with these words? Pee-pee, choo-choo train, eat, close light sleep. How can she think she can blend in? Only her skin and her hair are Chinese. Inside -- she is all American-made.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="女儿听了我这番话后很不高兴，因为言下之意，就是说她不像中国人。在她脸上，显出一种美国式的痛苦。十年前，她会因为不像中国人而叫好，但现在，她却迫切想做个中国人，而今这是很时髦的。可她却已醒悟得太晚了。多年来我一直试图教她讲中国话，可她就是听不进。她唯一能讲的中国话是“谢谢”，“关灯睡觉”，“火车”和“吃饭”。可在中国，靠这些“关灯睡觉”的中国话，怎么行呢？她怎么还担心会与中国人混为一体？事实上，除了她的头发和皮肤是中国式的外，她的内部，全是美国制造的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I taught her how American circumstances work. If you are born poor here, it's no lasting shame. You are first in line for a scholarship.

How to know your own worth and polish it, never flashing it around like a cheap ring. Why Chinese thinking is best.</div>

<div class="line_en">Why do you always tell people that I met your father in the Cathay House, that I broke open a fortune cookie and it said I would marry a dark, handsome stranger, and that when I looked up, there he was, the waiter, your father. Why do you make this joke? This is not sincere. This was not true! Your father was not a waiter, I never ate in that restaurant. The Cathay House had a sign that said "Chinese Food," so only Americans went there before it was torn down. Now it is a McDonald's restaurant with a big Chinese sign that says mai dong lou --"wheat," "east," "building." All nonsense. Why are you attracted only to Chinese nonsense? You must understand my real circumstances, how I arrived, how I married, how I lost my Chinese face, why you are the way you are.</div>

And I had saved money from my twelve years' work as a telephone operator. But it is true I did not take the fastest plane. The plane took three weeks. It stopped everywhere: Hong Kong, Vietnam, the Philippines, Hawaii. So by the time I arrived, I did not look sincerely glad to be here.</div>

<div class="line_en">When I arrived, nobody asked me questions. The authorities looked at my papers and stamped me in. I decided to go first to a San Francisco address given to me by this girl in Peking. The bus put me down on a wide street with cable cars. This was California Street. I walked up this hill and then I saw a tall building. This was Old St. Mary's. Under the church sign, in handwritten Chinese characters, someone had added: "A Chinese Ceremony to Save Ghosts from Spiritual Unrest 7 A. M. and 8:30 A. M." I memorized this information in case the authorities asked me where I worshipped my religion. And then I saw another sign across the street. It was painted on the outside of a short building: "Save Today for Tomorrow, at Bank of America." And I thought to myself, This is where American people worship. See, even then I was not so dumb! Today that church is the same size, but where that short bank used to be, now there is a tall building, fifty stories high, where you and your husband-to-be work and look down on everybody.</div>

<div class="line_en">So by the time I found the address the girl in Peking gave me, I knew not to expect too much. The address was a large green building, so noisy, children running up and down the outside stairs and hallways. Inside number 402, I found an old woman who told me right away she had wasted her time waiting for me all week. She quickly wrote down some addresses and gave them to me, keeping her hand out after I took the paper. So I gave her an American dollar and she looked at it and said, "Syaujye"-- Miss --"we are in America now. Even a beggar can starve on this dollar." So I gave her another dollar and she said, "Aii, you think it is so easy getting this information?" So I gave her another and she closed her hand and her mouth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我终于按地址找到了那个北京女孩提供我的地方，尽管我早对此不抱太高的希望，但那个吵闹肮脏的环境，还是令我倒抽了一口冷气。这是一幢绿色大楼，一大群孩子老鼠样在楼道上窜蹦着。在402号，一个老太太出来了，她一开口就抱怨着，她足足等了我一个礼拜。然后，她又很快就写下几个地址给我，随后她向我摊开她的手，我给了她一美元，她不屑地瞄了眼，说：“小姐，”她用汉语说，“这里是美国，哪怕一个叫花子，一美元也打发不了的。”我又给了她一美元，她说：“唷，你以为我这个咨询如此廉价呀！”我只好再给她一美元，她这才不吭声了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So I kept walking up this hill. I saw two pagodas, one on each side of the street, as though they were the entrance to a great Buddha temple. But when I looked carefully, I saw the pagoda was really just a building topped with stacks of tile roofs, no walls, nothing else under its head. I was surprised how they tried to make everything look like an old imperial city or an emperor's tomb. But if you looked on either side of these pretend-pagodas, you could see the streets became narrow and crowded, dark, and dirty. I thought to myself, Why did they choose only the worst Chinese parts for the inside? Why didn't they build gardens and ponds instead? Oh, here and there was the look of a famous ancient cave or a Chinese opera. But inside it was always the same cheap stuff.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我继续沿着小坡路往上走，街道变得越来越狭窄、阴暗和肮脏，虽然一路上能不时看看各种有中国特点的装饰，却都是粗糙蹩脚得很，我弄不明白，为什么人们总要把中国风味中最落后的部分作为特色来点缀？他们为什么不建造些庭园或水池之类？哦，到处都是著名的古代洞穴或中国歌剧的景象。但里面总是一样便宜的东西。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So my mother was right about my hardships. This job in the cookie factory was one of the worst. Big black machines worked all day and night pouring little pancakes onto moving round griddles. The other women and I sat on high stools, and as the little pancakes went by, we had to grab them off the hot griddle just as they turned golden. We would put a strip of paper in the center, then fold the cookie in half and bend its arms back just as it turned hard. If you grabbed the pancake too soon, you would burn your fingers on the hot, wet dough. But if you grabbed too late, the cookie would harden before you could even complete the first bend. And then you had to throw these mistakes in a barrel, which counted against you because the owner could sell those only as scraps.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="由此想到母亲曾对我说过：“我早年的生活是坎坷颠簸的，这很有道理。后来，我就在一家甜饼工场做事。我们坐在机器边的高凳上，机器上不断运送出滚烫的小煎饼，而我要做的，则是抓起那滚烫的金黄色的煎饼，嵌进一张命运条，然后趁着煎饼尚未变硬时，把它们对折。这工作看着简单，却十分辛苦。你如果下手太快，会让烫黏的面团灼痛手指，落手太慢，甜饼就会变硬，那就无法嵌进命运条，而且这个煎饼也就报废了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">With the addresses this old woman gave me, I found a cheap apartment on Washington Street. It was like all the other places, sitting on top of a little store. And through this three-dollar list, I found a terrible job paying me seventy-five cents an hour. Oh, I tried to get a job as a salesgirl, but you had to know English for that. I tried for another job as a Chinese hostess, but they also wanted me to rub my hands up and down foreign men, and I knew right away this was as bad as fourth-class prostitutes in China! So I rubbed that address out with black ink. And some of the other jobs required you to have a special relationship. They were jobs held by families from Canton and Toishan and the Four Districts, southern people who had come many years ago to make their fortune and were still holding onto them with the hands of their great-grandchildren.</div>

<div class="line_en">After the first day, I suffered ten red fingers. This was not a job for a stupid person. You had to learn fast or your fingers would turn into fried sausages. So the next day only my eyes burned, from never taking them off the pancakes. And the day after that, my arms ached from holding them out ready to catch the pancakes at just the right moment. But by the end of my first week, it became mindless work and I could relax enough to notice who else was working on each side of me. One was an older woman who never smiled and spoke to herself in Cantonese when she was angry. She talked like a crazy person. On my other side was a woman around my age. Her barrel contained very few mistakes. But I suspected she ate them. She was quite plump.</div>

<div class="line_en">So we were shy at first, your father and I, neither of us able to speak to each other in our Chinese dialects. We went to English class together, speaking to each other in those new words and sometimes taking out a piece of paper to write a Chinese character to show what we meant. At least we had that, a piece of paper to hold us together. But it's hard to tell someone's marriage intentions when you can't say things aloud. All those little signs -- the teasing, the bossy, scolding words -- that's how you know if it is serious. But we could talk only in the manner of our English teacher. I see cat. I see rat. I see hat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第一次与你父亲见面，我们两人都挺害羞的。我们各自不懂对方的方言：广东话和国语，我们便一起去上英语课，讲英语，有时将汉字写在纸上来帮助理解对方的意思。但对于要结成一对夫妇的男女来说，这样的谈话是远远不够的，而这样的谈话方式，颇像英语课上的会话：“我看见一只猫，我看见一只老鼠，这是帽子。”">查看中文翻译</div>

He is not a citizen, but I'm sure he knows how to make one." So that is how I first heard about Tin Jong, your father. It was not like my first marriage, where everything was arranged. I had a choice. I could choose to marry your father, or I could choose not to marry him and go back to China.</div>

Otherwise, you will be an old lady before it comes to his mind."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="至今我也对自己好生奇怪，为什么我非要抓住婚姻这个字眼呢？我想，那全是因为安梅给我灌输的那一套。她常跟我说：“在电影里，男孩和女孩传字条，然后双双陷入爱情烦恼之中而不可自拔。你也需要做点这样的游戏，否则，待你醒悟过来，你已成为个老太婆了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

I named him Vincent, which sounds like "win cent," the sound of making money, because I was beginning to think we did not have enough. And then I bumped my nose riding on the bus. Soon after that you were born.</div>

<div class="line_en">I don't know what caused me to change. Maybe it was my crooked nose that damaged my thinking. Maybe it was seeing you as a baby, how you looked so much like me, and this made me dissatisfied with my life. I wanted everything for you to be better. I wanted you to have the best circumstances, the best character. I didn't want you to regret anything. And that's why I named you Waverly. It was the name of the street we lived on. And I wanted you to think, This is where I belong. But I also knew if I named you after this street, soon you would grow up, leave this place, and take a piece of me with you.</div>
