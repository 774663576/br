<div class="line_en">In the walls of the cubicle there were three orifices. To the right of the speakwrite, a small pneumatic tube for written messages; to the left, a larger one for newspapers; and in the side wall, within easy reach of Winston's arm, a large oblong slit protected by a wire grating. This last was for the disposal of waste paper. Similar slits existed in thousands or tens of thousands throughout the building, not only in every room but at short intervals in every corridor. For some reason they were nicknamed memory holes. When one knew that any document was due for destruction, or even when one saw a scrap of waste paper lying about, it was an automatic action to lift the flap of the nearest memory hole and drop it in, where-upon it would be whirled away on a current of warm air to the enormous furnaces which were hidden somewhere in the recesses of the building.</div>

<div class="line_en">Winston dialled "back numbers" on the telescreen and called for the appropriate issues of the Times, which slid out of the pneumatic tube after only a few minutes' delay. The messages he had received referred to articles or news-items which for one reason or another it was thought necessary to alter, or, as the official phrase had it, to rectify. For example, it appeared from the Times of the seventeenth of March that Big Brother, in his speech of the previous day, had predicted that the South Indian front would remain quiet but that a Eurasian offensive would shortly be launched in North Africa. As it happened the Eurasian Higher Command had launched its offensive in South India and left North Africa alone. It was therefore necessary to rewrite a paragraph of Big Brother's speech, in such a way as to make him predict the thing that had actually happened. Or again, the Times of the nineteenth of December had published the official forecasts of the output of various classes of consumption goods in the fourth quarter of 1983, which was also the sixth quarter of the Ninth Three-Year Plan. Today's issue contained a statement of the actual output, from which it appeared that the forecasts were in every instance grossly wrong. Winston's job was to rectify the original figures by making them agree with the later ones. As for the third message, it referred to a very simple error which could be set right in a couple of minutes. As short a time ago as February, the Ministry of Plenty had issued a promise (a "categorical pledge" were the official words) that there would be no reduction of the chocolate ration during 1984. Actually, as Winston was aware, the chocolate ration was to be reduced from thirty grammes to twenty at the end of the present week. All that was needed was to substitute for the original promise a warning that it would probably be necessary to reduce the ration at some time in April.</div>

<div class="line_en">What happened in the unseen labyrinth to which the pneumatic tubes led, he did not know in detail, but he did know in general terms. As soon as all the corrections which happened to be necessary in any particular number of the Times had been assembled and collated, that number would be reprinted, the original copy destroyed, and the corrected copy placed on the files in its stead. This process of continuous alteration was applied not only to newspapers, but to books, periodicals, pamphlets, posters, leaflets, films, sound-tracks, cartoons, photographs -- to every kind of literature or documentation which might conceivably hold any political or ideological significance. Day by day and almost minute by minute the past was brought up to date. In this way every prediction made by the Party could be shown by documentary evidence to have been correct; nor was any item of news, or any expression of opinion, which conflicted with the needs of the moment, ever allowed to remain on record. All history was a palimpsest, scraped clean and re-inscribed exactly as often as was necessary. In no case would it have been possible, once the deed was done, to prove that any falsification had taken place. The largest section of the Records Department, far larger than the one in which Winston worked, consisted simply of persons whose duty it was to track down and collect all copies of books, newspapers and other documents which had been superseded and were due for destruction. A number of the Times which might, because of changes in political alignment, or mistaken prophecies uttered by Big Brother, have been rewritten a dozen times still stood on the files bearing its original date, and no other copy existed to contradict it. Books, also, were recalled and re-written again and again, and were invariably re-issued without any admission that any alteration had been made. Even the written instructions which Winston received, and which he invariably got rid of as soon as he had dealt with them, never stated or implied that an act of forgery was to be committed: always the reference was to slips, errors, misprints or misquotations which it was necessary to put right in the interests of accuracy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="气压输送管通向的不可见的迷宫中发生了什么，他并不十分清楚，但他能知道个大概。任何一期《泰晤士报》所需订正的材料一经收集、核对，那期报纸就要重印，原版报纸则被毁掉，经订正的报纸存档，取代原先那期。这一不断改动的程序不仅运用于报纸，也运用于图书、期刊、手册、招贴、传单、影片、盒带、动画、照片——包括每一种被认为具有政治和意识形态重要性的文献资料。日复一日，甚至每分每秒，过去被不断更新。这样，党的每一项预言都可以由文献材料来证明其正确；任何一条新闻，或观点的表达，如果与现实需要冲突，就不会被保留在档案中。所有的历史就像可以重写的羊皮书卷，被刮干净、重新书写，需要多少次就多少次。一旦这一过程完成，无论如何都无法证明篡改发生过。记录司的最大一个部门，比温斯顿工作的部门要大得多，其工作人员的职责就是追查和收集所有被取代和注定要销毁的图书、报纸和其他文献资料。某期《泰晤士报》，因政治阵营的变化、或老大哥所作预言的失误，被改写了十多次，但在档案中依旧有着原版日期，任何其他与之相矛盾的报纸都不复存在。图书也是这样，一再被收回、重写，照常出版，没有任何改动说明。甚至温斯顿收到的书面指示，他一经处理就毫无例外扔掉的书面指示，从不说明或暗示要进行的伪造行为：提到的总是疏漏、差错、印刷错误或引用有误，为准确起见，这些都需要加以订正。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As soon as Winston had dealt with each of the messages, he clipped his speakwritten corrections to the appropriate copy of the Times and pushed them into the pneumatic tube.

<div class="line_en">But actually, he thought as he re-adjusted the Ministry of Plenty's figures, it was not even forgery. It was merely the substitution of one piece of nonsense for another. Most of the material that you were dealing with had no connection with anything in the real world, not even the kind of connection that is contained in a direct lie. Statistics were just as much a fantasy in their original version as in their rectified version. A great deal of the time you were expected to make them up out of your head. For example, the Ministry of Plenty's forecast had estimated the output of boots for the quarter at a hundred and forty-five million pairs. The actual output was given as sixty-two millions. Winston, however, in re-writing the forecast, marked the figure down to fifty-seven millions, so as to allow for the usual claim that the quota had been over-fulfilled. In any case, sixty-two millions was no nearer the truth than fifty-seven millions, or than a hundred and forty-five millions. Very likely no boots had been produced at all. Likelier still, nobody knew how many had been produced, much less cared. All one knew was that every quarter astronomical numbers of boots were produced on paper, while perhaps half the population of Oceania went barefoot. And so it was with every class of recorded fact, great or small. Everything faded away into a shadow-world in which, finally, even the date of the year had become uncertain.</div>

<div class="line_en">Winston hardly knew Tillotson, and had no idea what work he was employed on. People in the Records Department did not readily talk about their jobs. In the long, windowless hall, with its double row of cubicles and its endless rustle of papers and hum of voices murmuring into speakwrites, there were quite a dozen people whom Winston did not even know by name, though he daily saw them hurrying to and fro in the corridors or gesticulating in the Two Minutes Hate. He knew that in the cubicle next to him the little woman with sandy hair toiled day in, day out, simply at tracking down and deleting from the press the names of people who had been vaporised and were therefore considered never to have existed. There was a certain fitness in this, since her own husband had been vaporised a couple of years earlier. And a few cubicles away a mild, ineffectual, dreamy creature named Ampleforth, with very hairy ears and a surprising talent for juggling with rhymes and metres, was engaged in producing garbled versions -- definitive texts, they were called -- of poems which had become ideologically offensive but which for one reason or another were to be retained in the anthologies. And this hall, with its fifty workers or thereabouts, was only one sub-section, a single cell, as it were, in the huge complexity of the Records Department. Beyond, above, below, were other swarms of workers engaged in an unimaginable multitude of jobs. There were the huge printing shops with their sub-editors, their typography experts and their elaborately-equipped studios for the faking of photographs. There was the tele-programmes section with its engineers, its producers and its teams of actors specially chosen for their skill in imitating voices. There were the armies of reference clerks whose job was simply to draw up lists of books and periodicals which were due for recall. There were the vast repositories where the corrected documents were stored, and the hidden furnaces where the original copies were destroyed. And somewhere or other, quite anonymous, there were the directing brains who co-ordinated the whole effort and laid down the lines of policy which made it necessary that this fragment of the past should be preserved, that one falsified, and the other rubbed out of existence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="温斯顿对蒂洛森所知甚少，不知道他是做什么的。记录司的人不愿意谈论他们的工作。长长的、没有窗户的大厅里有两排小隔间，不停在传出翻动纸张的沙沙声和对着述写器喃喃低语的嗡嗡声。这儿有十多个人，温斯顿甚至叫不出他们的名字，虽然他每天都见到他们在过道急匆匆地走过，或在两分钟仇恨活动中手舞足蹈。他知道，他旁边工作间的那位浅棕色头发的小个子女人一天到晚忙个不停，只是从报章杂志中找出并去掉那些已经蒸发了的人的名字，这些人被认为从来没有存在过。她来做这件事颇为合适，因为几年前她自己的丈夫就蒸发了。过去几个小隔间，有个温和、软弱、神情恍惚的人，名叫安普尔福思，耳朵毛茸茸的，玩弄节奏韵律倒有意想不到的才华，他从事篡改诗歌版本——他们称为最后的文本——这些诗歌在意识形态方面有害，但出于某种考虑，它们仍留在选集中。这间大厅，有五十多个工作人员，但这只是一个分部，是庞大而又复杂的记录司的一个单元。在它的周围，还有无数的职工从事着难以想象的大量工作。还有很大的印刷车间，有编校人员、排印能手和伪造图片的设备精良的暗房。还有电视节目部门，有工程技术人员、制片人、众多的演员，这些演员经过特殊选拔，具有声音模仿技能。还有大量的资料员，他们的工作就是草拟要收回的图书和期刊清单。还有巨大的贮藏室，订正后的文献资料保存在那儿。还有隐蔽的火炉，焚毁那些原版材料。还有不知在哪儿，也不透露姓名的决策者，协调这整个的工作，并制订政策，过去的哪些片断可以保留，哪些需要篡改，哪些应该抹去。">查看中文翻译</div>

And the Ministry had not only to supply the multifarious needs of the Party, but also to repeat the whole operation at a lower level for the benefit of the proletariat. There was a whole chain of separate departments dealing with proletarian literature, music, drama and entertainment generally. Here were produced rubbishy newspapers containing almost nothing except sport, crime and astrology, sensational five-cent novelettes, films oozing with sex, and sentimental songs which were composed entirely by mechanical means on a special kind of kaleidoscope known as a versificator. There was even a whole sub-section -- Pornosec, it was called in Newspeak -- engaged in producing the lowest kind of pornography, which was sent out in sealed packets and which no Party member, other than those who worked on it, was permitted to look at.</div>

Big Brother's Order for the Day, it seemed, had been chiefly devoted to praising the work of an organisation known as FFCC, which supplied cigarettes and other comforts to the sailors in the Floating Fortresses.

<div class="line_en">Three months later FFCC had suddenly been dissolved with no reasons given. One could assume that Withers and his associates were now in disgrace, but there had been no report of the matter in the press or on the telescreen. That was to be expected, since it was unusual for political offenders to be put on trial or even publicly denounced. The great purges involving thousands of people, with public trials of traitors and thought-criminals who made abject confession of their crimes and were afterwards executed, were special show-pieces not occurring oftener than once in a couple of years. More commonly, people who had incurred the displeasure of the Party simply disappeared and were never heard of again. One never had the smallest clue as to what had happened to them. In some cases they might not even be dead. Perhaps thirty people personally known to Winston, not counting his parents, had disappeared at one time or another.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="三个月后，FFCC突然被解散，原因不详。可以设想，威瑟斯和他的同事现在处境尴尬，但报纸或电视都没有这件事的报道。这不奇怪，因为政治上犯错误的人被审判或公开遭谴责是不寻常的，大清洗牵涉数以千计的人，对叛徒和思想犯进行公开审判，让他们卑躬屈节地忏悔罪行，最后加以处决，这种杀一儆百的特殊案例几年内难得发生一起。更常见的是，那些招致党不快的人只是消失了，从此音讯全无。没有任何线索可以知道他们遭遇了什么。有些情况下，他们甚至没有死。温斯顿知道的，也许就有三十个人（不包括他的父母），在不同时期失踪了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Winston stroked his nose gently with a paper-clip. In the cubicle across the way Comrade Tillotson was still crouching secretively over his speakwrite. He raised his head for a moment: again the hostile spectacle-flash. Winston wondered whether Comrade Tillotson was engaged on the same job as himself. It was perfectly possible. So tricky a piece of work would never be entrusted to a single person: on the other hand, to turn it over to a committee would be to admit openly that an act of fabrication was taking place. Very likely as many as a dozen people were now working away on rival versions of what Big Brother had actually said. And presently some master brain in the Inner Party would select this version or that, would re-edit it and set in motion the complex processes of cross-referencing that would be required, and then the chosen lie would pass into the permanent records and become truth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="温斯顿用回形针轻轻地刮了一下鼻子。在对面那个工作间，蒂洛森同志还神秘兮兮地凑着述写器。他抬了一下头，镜片上闪出敌意的反光。温斯顿猜想蒂洛森同志可能和自己做着同样的工作。这很有可能。如此棘手的工作不会信任某一个人去做，而如果交给一个委员会来处理，又会导致公开承认正在造假。很可能此刻有十多个人在分别修改老大哥说过的话。而核心党内也可能有某个重要人物挑选这个或那个版本，重新编辑，并按要求启动整个相互参照的程序，最终，选定的谎言就会进入永久的文献，成为真理。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Winston did not know why Withers had been disgraced. Perhaps it was for corruption or incompetence. Perhaps Big Brother was merely getting rid of a too-popular subordinate. Perhaps Withers or someone close to him had been suspected of heretical tendencies. Or perhaps -- what was likeliest of all -- the thing had simply happened because purges and vaporisations were a necessary part of the mechanics of government. The only real clue lay in the words "refs unpersons", which indicated that Withers was already dead. You could not invariably assume this to be the case when people were arrested. Sometimes they were released and allowed to remain at liberty for as much as a year or two years before being executed. Very occasionally some person whom you had believed dead long since would make a ghostly re-appearance at some public trial where he would implicate hundreds of others by his testimony before vanishing, this time for ever. Withers, however, was already an unperson. He did not exist: he had never existed. Winston decided that it would not be enough simply to reverse the tendency of Big Brother's speech. It was better to make it deal with something totally unconnected with its original subject.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="温斯顿不知道威瑟斯为何名誉扫地。也许是因为腐败或渎职。也许仅仅是老大哥想要除掉一个声望很高的下属。也许威瑟斯或他的某个同僚被觉察到有异端倾向。也许——最有可能——这样的事发生只是因为清洗和蒸发是政府机制的必要组成部分。唯一真正的线索就是这样的文字：“涉及非人”，表明威瑟斯已经死了。你并不总能因有人被捕而作出这样的假定。有时，他们被释放了，允许在被处决前有一两年的自由。偶尔也有这样的情况，很久以来你认为已经死去的某个人，突然又像鬼魂一样在某个公审大会上重新露面，他的证词牵涉到另外几百个人，之后他便永远消失了。然而，威瑟斯已是一个非人。他不存在，他从来就没有存在过。温斯顿觉得，仅仅改变老大哥讲话的倾向还不够。要是能将他的讲话处理得同原来的话题毫不相干则更好。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Winston thought for a moment, then pulled the speakwrite towards him and began dictating in Big Brother's familiar style: a style at once military and pedantic, and, because of a trick of asking questions and then promptly answering them ("What lessons do we learn from this fact, comrades? The lesson -- which is also one of the fundamental principles of Ingsoc -- that," etc. etc.), easy to imitate.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="温斯顿想了一会儿，随后将述写器拉过来，开始以老大哥惯用的风格进行口授，这是一种既军事化又学究气的讲话风格，也因为一种提出问题又马上回答的伎俩（“同志们，我们能从中吸取什么教训呢？教训是——这也是英社的基本原则之一”等等），所以很容易模仿。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He might turn the speech into the usual denunciation of traitors and thought-criminals, but that was a little too obvious; while to invent a victory at the front, or some triumph of over-production in the Ninth Three-Year Plan, might complicate the records too much. What was needed was a piece of pure fantasy. Suddenly there sprang into his mind, ready made as it were, the image of a certain Comrade Ogilvy, who had recently died in battle, in heroic circumstances. There were occasions when Big Brother devoted his Order for the Day to commemorating some humble, rank-and-file Party member whose life and death he held up as an example worthy to be followed. Today he should commemorate Comrade Ogilvy. It was true that there was no such person as Comrade Ogilvy, but a few lines of print and a couple of faked photographs would soon bring him into existence.</div>

<div class="line_en">At the age of three Comrade Ogilvy had refused all toys except a drum, a sub-machine gun and a model helicopter. At six -- a year early, by a special relaxation of the rules -- he had joined the Spies; at nine he had been a troop leader. At eleven he had denounced his uncle to the Thought Police after overhearing a conversation which appeared to him to have criminal tendencies. At seventeen he had been a district organiser of the Junior Anti-Sex League. At nineteen he had designed a hand grenade which had been adopted by the Ministry of Peace and which, at its first trial, had killed thirty-one Eurasian prisoners in one burst. At twenty-three he had perished in action. Pursued by enemy jet planes while flying over the Indian Ocean with important despatches, he had weighted his body with his machine-gun and leapt out of the helicopter into deep water, despatches and all -- an end, said Big Brother, which it was impossible to contemplate without feelings of envy. Big Brother added a few remarks on the purity and single-mindedness of Comrade Ogilvy's life. He was a total abstainer and a non-smoker, had no recreations except a daily hour in the gymnasium, and had taken a vow of celibacy, believing marriage and the care of a family to be incompatible with a twenty-four-hour-a-day devotion to duty. He had no subjects of conversation except the principles of Ingsoc, and no aim in life except the defeat of the Eurasian enemy and the hunting-down of spies, saboteurs, thought-criminals and traitors generally.</div>

<div class="line_en">Once again he glanced at his rival in the opposite cubicle. Something seemed to tell him with certainty that Tillotson was busy on the same job as himself. There was no way of knowing whose version would finally be adopted, but he felt a profound conviction that it would be his own. Comrade Ogilvy, unimagined an hour ago, was now a fact. It struck him as curious that you could create dead men but not living ones. Comrade Ogilvy, who had never existed in the present, now existed in the past, and when once the act of forgery was forgotten, he would exist just as authentically, and upon the same evidence, as Charlemagne or Julius Caesar.</div>
