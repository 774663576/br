<div class="line_en">I went on eating my eggs and bacon, Jasper at my feet, the old dog in her basket in the corner. I wondered what I should do with my day. I had slept badly; perhaps because I was alone in the room. I had been restless, waking up often, and when I glanced at my clock I saw the hands had scarcely moved. When I did fall asleep I had varied, wandering dreams. We were walking through woods, Maxim and I, and he was always just a little ahead of me. I could not keep up with him. Nor could I see his face. Just his figure, striding away in front of me all the time. I must have cried while I slept, for when I woke in the morning the pillow was damp. My eyes were heavy too, when I looked in the glass. I looked plain, unattractive. I rubbed a little rouge on my cheeks in a wretched attempt to give myself colour. But it made me worse. It gave me a false clown look. Perhaps I did not know the best way to put it on. I noticed Robert staring at me as I crossed the hall and went into breakfast.</div>

<div class="line_en">Maxim rang up the next morning to say he would be back about seven. Frith took the message. Maxim did not ask to speak to me himself. I heard the telephone ring while I was at breakfast and I thought perhaps Frith would come into the dining-room and say "Mr de Winter on the telephone, Madam." I had put down my napkin and had risen to my feet. And then Frith came back into the dining-room and gave me the message.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, my dear, how are you?" she said, her telephone voice typical of herself, brisk, rather masculine, standing no nonsense, and then not waiting for my answer. "I thought of motoring over this afternoon and looking up Gran. I'm lunching with people about twenty miles from you. Shall I come and pick you up and we'll go together? It's time you met the old lady, you know."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，亲爱的，身体好吗？”即使在电话里，她说起话来也还是自有一功：干脆利落，颇有男子气概，容不得半点罗唆废话。这时她不等我回答就自顾自往下说：“下午我想开车去看看奶奶。现在我要上朋友家去吃午饭。离你那儿大约二十英里。到时候是不是让我来接你，咱们一起去？依我说，你也该去见见那位老太太了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The click of the receiver, and she was gone. I wandered back into the garden. I was glad she had rung up and suggested the plan of going over to see the grandmother. It made something to look forward to, and broke the monotony of the day. The hours had seemed so long until seven o'clock. I did not feel in my holiday mood today, and I had no wish to go off with Jasper to the Happy Valley and come to the cove and throw stones in the water. The sense of freedom had departed, and the childish desire to run across the lawns in sand-shoes. I went and sat down with a book and The Times and my knitting in the rose-garden, domestic as a matron, yawning in the warm sun while the bees hummed amongst the flowers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="滴答一声，她把电话挂了。我又信步走进了花园。我很高兴她打电话来约我去见老祖母。这一来总算可指望有点事，给百无聊赖的这一天添点儿生趣。要挨到晚上七点，这几个钟头还真没法熬呢。今天我一点没有假日的轻松感，无意和杰斯珀一起去幸福谷，去小海湾散步，往水里扔石子取乐。那种无拘无束的轻松心情，那种想要穿上帆布鞋在草坪上疾步飞奔的天真愿望，都已经为乌有。我走进玫瑰园，身边带着书、《泰晤士报》。还有编结活儿，在那儿坐定，尸然是个守着家庭过安分日子的主妇。我坐在暖洋洋的阳光里，呵欠连连，蜂群在周周围的花丛中嗡嗡飞舞。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I should not know. Even if I turned in my chair and looked up at the windows I would not see her. I remembered a game I had played as a child that my friends next-door had called "Grandmother's Steps" and myself "Old Witch". You had to stand at the end of the garden with your back turned to the rest, and one by one they crept nearer to you, advancing in short furtive fashion. Every few minutes you turned to look at them, and if you saw one of them moving the offender had to retire to the back line and begin again. But there was always one a little bolder than the rest, who came up very close, whose movement was impossible to detect, and as you waited there, your back turned, counting the regulation Ten, you knew, with a fatal terrifying certainty, that before long, before even the Ten was counted, this bold player would pounce upon you from behind, unheralded, unseen, with a scream of triumph. I felt as tense and expectant as I did then. I was playing "Old Witch" with Mrs Danvers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我没法去探知真情，即使在椅子里侧转身于，抬头向那排窗子望去，我也没法跟她打照面，我记起孩提时玩过一种游戏，邻屋的小朋友称之为“奶奶走路”，而我则管它叫“老巫婆”。玩时，你得站在花园的尽头，背对着其他人。他们一个接一个朝你悄悄走近，偷偷摸摸地走一阵停一会。每隔几分钟，你回过头来望望，要是有谁正好被你看到在走动，这人就被罚回原处从头走起。可是总有个把胆子比较大一点的小伙伴，已经挨近你身边，此人的行动简直不可能察觉；于是，就在你背对大家站着，嘴里从一数到十的时候，你一面提心吊胆，一面也明白自己已必输无疑，要不了一会儿，甚至连十也没数完，那个大胆的家伙就会神不知鬼不觉地从背后扑上来，同时还发出一声胜利的欢呼。此刻我全体会与那时一样的心情，紧张不安地等待着有人扑上身来。我正同丹弗斯太太玩“老巫婆”游戏呢。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There were so many windows in Manderley, so many rooms that were never used by Maxim and myself that were empty now; dust-sheeted, silent, rooms that had been occupied in the old days when his father and his grandfather had been alive, when there had been much entertaining, many servants. It would be easy for Mrs Danvers to open those doors softly and close them again, and then steal quietly across the shrouded room and look down upon me from behind the drawn curtains.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="曼陀丽的窗户鳞次栉比。空房间也比比皆是，这些房间我和迈克西姆从不去使用，里面都蒙着防灰尘的罩单，悄寂无声；昔日他父亲的祖父在世时，宅子里宾客盈门，仆役成群，那些房间倒是都住人的。现在丹弗斯太太不用费什么周折，就可以悄悄推开一扇扇房门，随手再把门—一带上，然后蹑手蹑脚走进尘封已久的房间，来到窗口，在放下的窗帷后面窥视我的行动。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I tried to concentrate on the bald newspaper columns, and later to lose myself in the racy plot of the novel in my hands. I did not want to think of yesterday afternoon and Mrs Danvers. I tried to forget that she was in the house at this moment, perhaps looking down on me from one of the windows. And now and again, when I looked up from my book or glanced across the garden, I had the feeling I was not alone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我没法集中思想，细读报上那些干巴巴的专栏文章，接着又捧起小说，想让曲折离奇的故事情节把自己吸引住。我不愿去想昨天下午的事，不愿想到丹弗斯大太。我尽量设法排遣这样的念头：她此刻正在屋子里，说不定就躲在楼上某扇窗子背后，注视着我的一举一动。我不时抬起头来，朝花园那边看一眼，总觉得这儿并非只有我一人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Lunch was a welcome break to the long morning. The calm efficiency of Frith, and Robert's rather foolish face, helped me more than my book and my newspaper had done. And at half past three, punctual to the moment, I heard the sound of Beatrice's car round the sweep of the drive and pull up at the steps before the house. I ran out to meet her, ready dressed, my gloves in my hand. "Well, my dear, here I am, what a splendid day, isn't it?" She slammed the door of the car and came up the steps to meet me. She gave me a hard swift kiss, brushing me somewhere near the ear.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="好不容易挨到午餐时分，冗长的上午总算告一段落。看着弗里思有条不紊、手脚麻利地张罗，望着罗伯特傻乎乎的神态，比看书读报更能排遣时间。到了三点半，分秒不差，车道拐角处传来比阿特丽斯汽车的马达声，一转眼车子已停在屋前台阶边。我已穿着停当，拿好手套，这时就三步并作两步出门相迎。“喂，亲爱的，我来啦，少有的好天气，是吗？”她砰地一声关上车门，跨上台阶迎着我走来。她飞快地吻了我，嘴唇在我耳朵边的脸颊上使劲擦了一下。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You don't look well," she said immediately, looking me up and down, "much too thin in the face and no colour. What's wrong with you?"</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“哼，”她不留情地冲着我说，“你同迈克西姆一样的毛病，就是不肯承认自己身体不行。嗳，使点儿劲，不然车门关不上的。”我们沿车道驶去，车子开得很猛，到拐角上突然一个转弯。“我说，你不会是有喜了吧？”她说着侧过脸来，那双锐利的褐色眼睛盯在我身上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，精不精无所谓，只要会打就行。我不能容受那些啥也不想学的家伙。冬日黄昏茶余饭后，真不知道该怎么对付他们！一个人总不能老是坐着谈天说地。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Much better, too," she said, "awful bore, I always think, those big parties. You won't find it alarming if you come to stay with us. Very nice lot of people all round, and we all know one another frightfully well. We dine in one another's houses, and have our bridge, and don't bother with outsiders. You do play bridge, don't you?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“还是这样好，”她说。“我总觉得，那些盛大宴会实在叫人腻烦。如果你来我们这儿小住，肯定不会让你感到惶恐不安。左右邻居都是些好人，大家混得很熟，不是在这家吃饭，就是去那家聚餐，还经常在一块儿打桥牌，不多跟外人罗唆。你会打桥牌吧？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's quite amusing now Roger is a reasonable age," she went on, "because he brings his friends to stay, and we have really good fun. You ought to have been with us last Christmas. We had charades. My dear, it was the greatest fun. Giles was in his element. He adores dressing up, you know, and after a glass or two of champagne he's the funniest thing you've ever seen. We often say he's missed his vocation and ought to have been on the stage." I thought of Giles, and his large moon face, his horn spectacles. I felt the sight of him being funny after champagne would embarrass me. "He and another man, a great friend of ours, Dickie Marsh, dressed up as women and sang a duet. What exactly it had to do with the word in the charade nobody knew, but it did not matter. We all roared."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“现在罗杰大了，生活可有趣哩，”她接着说。“他把朋友带到家来，我们一起玩呀笑呀，好不热闹！要是去年你和我们一起过圣诞节，那该有多好。我们玩哑谜猜字游戏。啊哟，真是好玩极了。贾尔斯如鱼得水，大显身手。你知道，他最喜欢化装表演。一两杯香摈下肚，他那副滑稽相真够你乐的。我们常惋惜他没能人尽其材，他应该去当演员才对。”我想着贾尔斯，脑子里出现了他的那张大圆脸，还有那副角质框眼镜。要是真的看到他酒后的丑态，我一定会觉得怪不好意思。“我们有个好朋友，叫迪基—马什，他和贾尔斯男扮女装，来了个二重唱，谁也搞不清楚这同哑谜猜字中的谜底有什么关系，不过这也无关紧要，反正两人逗得我们哄堂大笑。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Maxim's grandmother suffered her in patience. She closed her eyes as though she too were tired. She looked more like Maxim than ever. I knew how she must have looked when she was young, tall, and handsome, going round to the stables at Manderley with sugar in her pockets, holding her trailing skirt out of the mud. I pictured the nipped-in waist, the high collar, I heard her ordering the carriage for two o'clock. That was all finished now for her, all gone. Her husband had been dead for forty years, her son for fifteen. She had to live in this bright, red gabled house with the nurse until it was time for her to die. I thought how little we know about the feelings of old people. Children we understand, their fears and hopes and make-believe. I was a child yesterday. I had not forgotten. But Maxim's grandmother, sitting there in her shawl with her poor blind eyes, what did she feel, what was she thinking? Did she know that Beatrice was yawning and glancing at her watch? Did she guess that we had come to visit her because we felt it right, it was a duty, so that when she got home afterwards Beatrice would be able to say, "Well, that clears my conscience for three months."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对于这么一番折腾，迈克西姆的祖母倒也忍受得住。她闭上眼睛，似乎也感到累了。现在这副样子更像迈克西姆了。我可以想象出她年轻时在曼陀丽的模样：身材颀长，眉清目秀，兜里装着糖，手里提着裙摆，生怕裙子沾上泥巴，绕过屋子朝马厩走去。我脑子里勾划出她束着腰、穿着高领上衣的形象；耳朵里仿佛听到她吩咐下午两点钟给她备好马车的声音。现在。这一切对她来说都已化作过眼烟云，一去不复返了。她丈夫离开人世已有四十个春秋，儿子逝世至今也已十五年。老人现在只得住在这所人字形红砖楼房里，在护士的看护下，尽其天年。在我看来，我们对老人喜怒哀乐的感情变化差不多一无所知。对孩童我们则很了解，了解他们的恐惧和希望。了解他们弄虚作假的把戏，不久前我自己就是个孩子，对这一切记忆犹新。而现在迈克西姆的祖母坐在那儿，身子裹在披巾里，那双可怜的眼睛什么也看不见，她内心究竟有何感受？脑子里究竟在转什么念头？她是否知道比阿特丽斯此刻哈欠连连，不住地在看手表？她有没有想到我们所以来看望她，无非是因为我们觉得理应这么做，聊尽小辈的一份孝心？——这样，待会儿比阿特丽斯回到家里就可以说一声了“好了，我可以有三个月问心无愧”。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It's only just turned the half-hour, Madam," said Norah in a special voice, bright and cheerful like the nurse. I wondered if Maxim's grandmother realized that people spoke to her in this way. I wondered when they had done so for the first time, and if she had noticed then. Perhaps she had said to herself, "They think I'm getting old, how very ridiculous", and then little by little she had become accustomed to it, and now it was as though they had always done so, it was part of her background. But the young woman with the chestnut hair and the narrow waist who gave sugar to the horses, where was she?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“刚刚才四点半，太太。”诺拉用一种很特别的声调对她说，神态跟那护士一样，也是乐滋滋地满脸堆笑。我不知道迈克西姆的祖母是否觉察大家都用这种调门跟她说话。我不知道这种情况是打什么时候开始的，最初她是否曾注意到。也许那时候她曾对自己说：“多可笑，他们以为我老了呢。”到了后来，她也就逐渐习以为常，而时至今日，她会觉得这些人似乎向来就这么说话，此乃她生活中不可缺少的一部分陪衬。可是那位用糖喂马的栗发窈窕少女，如今却在何方？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I felt the afternoon had been too much for her. She wanted to be alone again, and did not want to face another belated tea at Manderley.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我看今天下午也真够她受的。她也想独自清静一下，不愿再在曼陀丽应付一顿晚了钟点的茶点。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Put on some weight next time I see you," she said; "it doesn't suit you to be so thin. Give Maxim my love, and forgive me for today." She vanished in a cloud of dust and I turned in down the drive.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“下回咱们见面时你得长胖点喔，”她说。“这么瘦骨伶仃，可不大好看。向迈克西姆问好。今天的事儿还得请你多多包涵。”她的车子一溜烟消失在飞扬的尘土之中，我转身沿着车道往庄园走回去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I got out of the car at the lodge gates and we kissed goodbye.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我在庄园门口走下汽车。我们互相吻别。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I wondered if it had altered much since Maxim's grandmother had driven down it in her carriage. She had ridden here as a young woman, she had smiled at the woman at the lodge as I did now. And in her day the lodge-keeper's wife had curtseyed, sweeping the path with her full wide skirt. This woman nodded to me briefly, and then called to her little boy, who was grubbing with some kittens at the back. Maxim's grandmother had bowed her head to avoid the sweeping branches of the trees, and the horse had trotted down the twisting drive where I now walked. The drive had been wider then, and smoother too, better kept. The woods did not encroach upon it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当年迈克西姆的祖母正是在这条车道上策马驱车的。从那以来，不知车道是不是已经大改其样。那时她还是个少妇，策马打这儿经过时，也像我现在这样曾朝看门人的妻子微笑打招呼。那时候，看门人的妻子还得向她行屈膝礼，那条像伞一样撑开的裙子拖拂着路面。而现在这个女人，只是朝我微微一点头，然后忙着转身去叫唤屋后正跟几只小猫咪一起扒弄泥土的小男孩。迈克西姆的祖母曾低头避开几根下垂摇曳的树枝，让坐骑放开四蹄，在我此刻走着的车道上快步奔跑。那时的车道保养得很好，路面比现在宽阔，也比现在平坦。两旁的树木还没侵入车道。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I did not think of her as she was now, lying against those pillows, with that shawl around her. I saw her when she was young, and when Manderley was her home. I saw her wandering in the gardens with a small boy, Maxim's father, clattering behind her on his hobby horse. He would wear a stiff Norfolk jacket and a round white collar.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="浮现在我脑海里的并不是那个倚靠枕垫身裹披巾的老妪形象，而是当年她以曼陀丽为家时的少妇情影。我仿佛看到她带了几个小男孩在花园里漫步，那孩子是迈克西姆的父亲，他骑着玩具竹马咋达咋达跟在她身后，身上穿件浆得笔挺的诺福克上衣，头颈里围着白色的领饰。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When I came to the end of the long drive at last I saw that Maxim's car was standing in front of the house. My heart lifted, I ran quickly into the hall. His hat and gloves were lying on the table. I went towards the library, and as I came near I heard the sound of voices, one raised louder than the other, Maxim's voice. The door was shut. I hesitated a moment before going in.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我终于来到车道的尽头，瞧见迈克西姆的汽车停在屋子前，不禁心头一喜，三步并作两步走进大厅，只见桌上放着他的帽子和手套。我朝藏书室走去，快到门口时，听到里面有人讲话，其中一个的嗓门压过另一个，那是迈克西姆的声音。门关着，我在门口踌躇了一下，设立刻走进去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Picnics to the cove would be an expedition, a treat that was not indulged in very often. There would be a photograph somewhere, in an old album -- all the family sitting very straight and rigid round a tablecloth set upon the beach, the servants in the background beside a huge lunch-basket. And I saw Maxim's grandmother when she was older too, a few years ago. Walking on the terrace at Manderley, leaning on a stick. And someone walked beside her, laughing, holding her arm. Someone tall and slim and very beautiful, who had a gift, Beatrice said, of being attractive to people. Easy to like, I supposed, easy to love.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那时候，到海湾去野餐一顿就好比一次远征，难得有机会享受这种乐趣。不知在什么地方，大概是在哪本保存了多年的影集里吧，可能还收藏着一张照片——阖家围着一块摊在沙滩上的台布正襟危坐，后面是一排仆役，站在大食品篮的旁边，我仿佛又看到前几年时候的迈克西姆的祖母，已显出龙钟老态，拄根拐杖，在曼陀丽的平台上一步一步走着。有个人走在她身边，悉心搀扶着她，一边还发出朗朗笑声。此人苗条颀长。面目姣好，用比阿特丽斯的话来说，生来具有一套讨人喜欢的本领。想来不论谁见着都会喜欢，都会钟情的。">查看中文翻译</div>

I happen to know his car was seen here yesterday afternoon. If you want to meet him you can meet him outside Manderley. I won't have him inside the gates, do you understand?

<div class="line_en">I waited a moment. Then I went slowly downstairs to the library. I opened the door and went in. Maxim was standing by the window, some letters in his hand. His back was turned to me. For a moment I thought of creeping out again, and going upstairs to my room and sitting there. He must have heard me though, for he swung round impatiently.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="过了一会我才慢慢走下楼梯，来到藏书室。我打开门，走进屋子，迈克西姆站在窗边，手里拿着几封信。他背对着我。有那么一刹那，我真想偷偷溜出去，上楼回自己房间，宁可一个人坐在那儿。想必是听到我的声音，只见他不耐烦地转过身来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I slipped away from the door to the stairs. I heard the door of the library open. I ran swiftly up the stairs and hid in the gallery. Mrs Danvers came out of the library, shutting the door behind her. I crouched against the wall of the gallery so that I should not be seen. I had caught one glimpse of her face. It was grey with anger, distorted, horrible.</div>
