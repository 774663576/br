<div class="line_en">In the stunned reaction that follows, I'm aware of one sound. Snow's laughter. An awful gurgling cackle accompanied by an eruption of foamy blood when the coughing begins. I see him bend forward, spewing out his life, until the guards block him from my sight.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Good night," I whisper to the bow in my hand and feel it go still. I raise my left arm and twist my neck down to rip off the pill on my sleeve. Instead my teeth sink into flesh. I yank my head back in confusion to find myself looking into Peeta's eyes, only now they hold my gaze. Blood runs from the teeth marks on the hand he clamped over my nightlock. "Let me go!"

<div class="line_en">In the mansion, they handcuff and blindfold me. I'm half dragged, half carried down long passages, up and down elevators, and deposited on a carpeted floor. The cuffs are removed and a door slams closed behind me. When I push the blindfold up, I find I'm in my old room at the Training Center. The one where I lived during those last precious days before my first Hunger Games and the Quarter Quell. The bed's stripped to the mattress, the closet gapes open, showing the emptiness inside, but I'd know this room anywhere.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到了总统府邸，卫兵把我铐起来，给我戴上眼蒙子。我被半拖半拽地穿过了长长的走廊，上了电梯，最后被扔到地毯上，之后，有人给我去掉手铐，大门砰的一声在我身后关闭。当我摘掉眼蒙子时，我发现自己被扔到了我原来在训练中心的房间。就是在这个房间，我度过了参加饥饿游戏和世纪极限赛前那宝贵的几天。床上只剩下床垫，衣柜大开着，里面空荡荡的，可无论怎样我都能认出这个房间。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I can't," he says. As they pull me away from him, I feel the pocket ripped from my sleeve, see the deep violet pill fall to the ground, watch Cinna's last gift get crunched under a guard's boot. I transform into a wild animal, kicking, clawing, biting, doing whatever I can to free myself from this web of hands as the crowd pushes in. The guards lift me up above the fray, where I continue to thrash as I'm conveyed over the crush of people. I start screaming for Gale. I can't find him in the throng, but he will know what I want. A good clean shot to end it all. Only there's no arrow, no bullet. Is it possible he can't see me? No. Above us, on the giant screens placed around the City Circle, everyone can watch the whole thing being played out. He sees, he knows, but he doesn't follow through. Just as I didn't when he was captured. Sorry excuses for hunters and friends. Both of us.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不能。”他说。当人们把我从他身边拽走时，我觉得袖子上装药的小兜被扯了下来，看到深紫色的药片掉在地上，看到西纳送给我的最后一件礼物踩在一个卫兵的脚下。当人群向我拥来时，我变成了疯狂的野兽，又踢、又抓、又咬，总之尽一切可能从紧抓着我的无数双手里挣脱出来。卫兵把我举起来，越过愤怒的人群的头顶向外走，但我仍在不停地踢打，我开始大喊盖尔的名字。我在人群里没有找到他，可我想他知道我想要什么。给我一箭，干净利索地结束这一切。只是我现在没有箭，也没有子弹。他会不会看不见我？不，在我们头顶，在城市广场周围的大屏幕上，每个人可以看到正在发生的一切。他看到了，他也知道，但他没出现在现场。就如同他被抓时我没能救他一样。猎人之间、朋友之间也有遗憾。我们两个都是。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">No such luck. By evening, the blood clots, leaving me stiff and sore and sticky but alive. I limp into the shower and program in the gentlest cycle I can remember, free of any soaps and hair products, and squat under the warm spray, elbows on my knees, head in my hands.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没这样的好运。到了晚上，血不流了，我感到浑身僵硬、疼痛、黏糊糊的，可还活着。我一瘸一拐地来到浴室，依照记忆，把水调到最柔和的一挡，不要泡沫和洗发露，然后胳膊肘放在膝盖上，手抱着头，蹲在那里，让暖暖的水流冲着我的身体。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It's a struggle to get to my feet and peel off my Mockingjay suit. I'm badly bruised and might have a broken finger or two, but it's my skin that's paid most dearly for my struggle with the guards. The new pink stuff has shredded like tissue paper and blood seeps through the laboratory-grown cells. No medics show up, though, and as I'm too far gone to care, I crawl up onto the mattress, expecting to bleed to death.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我吃力地站起来，又费了好大力气脱掉嘲笑鸟服装。我浑身青紫，也许有一两个指头已经断了。可在与卫兵的争斗中，损伤最厉害的是我的皮肤。新长好的粉嫩的皮肤像纸巾一样被撕扯开，血从精心呵护后长出来的细胞里渗出来。可是，没有医生过来，我做得太过火了，已经不值得医治。我蜷缩在床垫上，希望自己在血流不止中死去。">查看中文翻译</div>

I go ahead and eat the food, take the pills, rub the salve on my skin. I need to focus now on the manner of my suicide.</div>

<div class="line_en">I curl back up on the bloodstained mattress, not cold but feeling so naked with just the paper to cover my tender flesh. Jumping to my death's not an option -- the window glass must be a foot thick. I can make an excellent noose, but there's nothing to hang myself from. It's possible I could hoard my pills and then knock myself off with a lethal dose, except that I'm sure I'm being watched round the clock. For all I know, I'm on live television at this very moment while commentators try to analyze what could possibly have motivated me to kill Coin. The surveillance makes almost any suicide attempt impossible. Taking my life is the Capitol's privilege. Again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我蜷缩着躺在沾满血迹的床垫上，并不觉得冷，可是身子光光的，只有一张纸盖着自己片片嫩肉的肢体。死并不是件容易事——窗户的玻璃足有一英尺厚。我倒是会打绳结，可是却没有地方吊绳子。我也可以把药片积存起来，然后吞下足以致命的剂量，但可以肯定，我是二十四小时受到监视的。就我所知，此时此刻我肯定出现在电视屏幕上，而评论员正在分析我杀死科恩的真正动机。在严密的监视下，自杀几乎是不可能的。这一次，凯匹特再次掌握了生杀予夺的大权。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">What I can do is give up. I resolve to lie on the bed without eating, drinking, or taking my medications. I could do it, too. Just die. If it weren't for the morphling withdrawal. Not bit by bit like in the hospital in 13, but cold turkey. I must have been on a fairly large dose because when the craving for it hits, accompanied by tremors, and shooting pains, and unbearable cold, my resolve's crushed like an eggshell. I'm on my knees, raking the carpet with my fingernails to find those precious pills I flung away in a stronger moment. I revise my suicide plan to slow death by morphling. I will become a yellow-skinned bag of bones, with enormous eyes. I'm a couple of days into the plan, making good progress, when something unexpected happens.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我能做的只有放弃。我决定躺在床上不吃饭、不喝水、不吃药。去死，我也能做到。可是还有吗啡的脱瘾过程在拖我后腿。我现在不像在十三区的医院那样一点一点地减量，而是突然断药，我感到极为痛苦。以前的服用量一定很大，当毒瘾发作时，我浑身颤抖，感到钻心的疼痛，难以忍受的寒冷。我的决心就像脆弱的蛋壳一样被击碎了。我跪在地上，指甲在地毯上抓趴着，寻找着我在意志力未被击垮时扔掉的药片。我继而改变了自杀的计划，我要让吗啡把我慢慢毒死。到时因吗啡上瘾，我会变得骨瘦如柴、脸色蜡黄、眼窝深陷。这项计划我实施了几天，取得了不错的进展，可是意想不到的事发生了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I begin to sing. At the window, in the shower, in my sleep. Hour after hour of ballads, love songs, mountain airs. All the songs my father taught me before he died, for certainly there has been very little music in my life since. What's amazing is how clearly I remember them. The tunes, the lyrics. My voice, at first rough and breaking on the high notes, warms up into something splendid. A voice that would make the mockingjays fall silent and then tumble over themselves to join in. Days pass, weeks. I watch the snows fall on the ledge outside my window. And in all that time, mine is the only voice I hear.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我开始唱歌，无论是站在窗边时，洗澡时，还是在睡梦中，我一直不停地唱，民谣、爱情歌曲、歌颂大自然的歌曲，不一而足。所有爸爸过世前教过我的歌我都唱。当然，自从他过世后，我的生活里已经很少有音乐。可令人吃惊的是这些歌我都能清楚地记得，那曲调、那歌词。我的声音开始是沙哑的，唱到高音的地方就会唱破，但经过练习，声音也变得优美起来。我的声音可以让嘲笑鸟静下来听，然后慢慢地跟我学起来。几天过去了，几个星期过去了，我看着雪花落在外面的窗台上。在这段时间里，我听到的唯一的人声，是自己的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">What are they doing, anyway? What's the holdup out there? How difficult can it be to arrange the execution of one murderous girl? I continue with my own annihilation. My body's thinner than it's ever been and my battle against hunger is so fierce that sometimes the animal part of me gives in to the temptation of buttered bread or roasted meat. But still, I'm winning. For a few days I feel quite unwell and think I may finally be traveling out of this life, when I realize my morphling tablets are shrinking. They are trying to slowly wean me off the stuff. But why? Surely a drugged Mockingjay will be easier to dispose of in front of a crowd. And then a terrible thought hits me: What if they're not going to kill me? What if they have more plans for me? A new way to remake, train, and use me?</div>

<div class="line_en">After two days of my lying on my mattress with no attempt to eat, drink, or even take a morphling tablet, the door to my room opens. Someone crosses around the bed into my field of vision. Haymitch. "Your trial's over," he says. "Come on. We're going home."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我躺在床垫上，在两天时间里不吃、不喝，甚至不吃吗啡，我房间的门终于打开了。一个人走到我的床边，走进我的视线。是黑密斯。“你的审判已经结束。走吧，咱们回家。”他说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I won't do it. If I can't kill myself in this room, I will take the first opportunity outside of it to finish the job. They can fatten me up. They can give me a full body polish, dress me up, and make me beautiful again. They can design dream weapons that come to life in my hands, but they will never again brainwash me into the necessity of using them. I no longer feel any allegiance to these monsters called human beings, despise being one myself. I think that Peeta was onto something about us destroying one another and letting some decent species take over. Because something is significantly wrong with a creature that sacrifices its children's lives to settle its differences. You can spin it any way you like. Snow thought the Hunger Games were an efficient means of control. Coin thought the parachutes would expedite the war. But in the end, who does it benefit? No one. The truth is, it benefits no one to live in a world where these things happen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我不会听他们的了。如果我在这间屋子里无法将自己杀死，那么出去后一旦有机会我就会结束这一切。他们可以把我养肥，可以给我全身的皮肤整形，可以给我穿上漂亮衣服，可以把我打扮得光鲜漂亮。他们也可以设计梦幻武器，在我的手里活灵活现，但是他们永远都不可能再给我洗脑，让我使用这些武器，我永远都不会再效忠于这些被称作人类的魔鬼，尽管我自己也是其中之一。我想皮塔也已经明白了我们是在自相残杀，希望更体面的物种来代替我们。因为一个物种要靠牺牲自己的孩子来解决分歧，无论以任何借口，这显然是不正常的。斯诺认为饥饿游戏是控制反叛者的有效办法。科恩认为那些降落伞能结束战争。可到了最后，谁会受益？任何人都不会。事实是，生活在这个世界上的人，只要有此类事件发生，都不会受益。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After I shot Coin, there was pandemonium. When the ruckus died down, they discovered Snow's body, still tethered to the post. Opinions differ on whether he choked to death while laughing or was crushed by the crowd. No one really cares. An emergency election was thrown together and Paylor was voted in as president. Plutarch was appointed secretary of communications, which means he sets the programming for the airwaves. The first big televised event was my trial, in which he was also a star witness. In my defense, of course. Although most of the credit for my exoneration must be given to Dr. Aurelius, who apparently earned his naps by presenting me as a hopeless, shell-shocked lunatic. One condition for my release is that I'll continue under his care, although it will have to be by phone because he'd never live in a forsaken place like 12, and I'm confined there until further notice. The truth is, no one quite knows what to do with me now that the war's over, although if another one should spring up, Plutarch's sure they could find a role for me. Then Plutarch has a good laugh. It never seems to bother him when no one else appreciates his jokes.</div>

I guess I sleep, because the next thing I know, it's morning and Greasy Sae's banging around at the stove. She makes me eggs and toast and sits there until I've eaten it all. We don't talk much. Her little granddaughter, the one who lives in her own world, takes a bright blue ball of yarn from my mother's knitting basket. Greasy Sae tells her to put it back, but I say she can have it. No one in this house can knit anymore. After breakfast, Greasy Sae does the dishes and leaves, but she comes back up at dinnertime to make me eat again. I don't know if she's just being neighborly or if she's on the government's payroll, but she shows up twice every day. She cooks, I consume. I try to figure out my next move.

The two bows and a sheath of arrows Gale rescued on the night of the firebombing lie on the desk. I put on the hunting jacket and leave the rest of the stuff untouched. I fall asleep on the sofa in the formal living room.

I strip, and flakes of skin the size of playing cards cling to the garments. Avoiding the mirror, I step into the shower and scrub the roses from my hair, my body, my mouth. Bright pink and tingling, I find something clean to wear. It takes half an hour to comb out my hair. Greasy Sae unlocks the front door.

I'm about to yell vicious things at Peeta when the full name comes to me. Not plain rose but evening primrose. The flower my sister was named for. I give Peeta a nod of assent and hurry back into the house, locking the door behind me. But the evil thing is inside, not out. Trembling with weakness and anxiety, I run up the stairs. My foot catches on the last step and I crash onto the floor. I force myself to rise and enter my room. The smell's very faint but still laces the air. It's there. The white rose among the dried flowers in the vase. Shriveled and fragile, but holding on to that unnatural perfection cultivated in Snow's greenhouse. I grab the vase, stumble down to the kitchen, and throw its contents into the embers. As the flowers flare up, a burst of blue flame envelops the rose and devours it. Fire beats roses again. I smash the vase on the floor for good measure.</div>

A deep pit has been dug, and they're lining it with bones, a mass grave for my people. I skirt around the hole and enter the woods at my usual place. It doesn't matter, though. The fence isn't charged anymore and has been propped up with long branches to keep out the predators. But old habits die hard. I think about going to the lake, but I'm so weak that I barely make it to my meeting place with Gale. I sit on the rock where Cressida filmed us, but it's too wide without his body beside me.

My father's laugh. Peeta's father with the cookies. The color of Finnick's eyes. What Cinna could do with a length of silk. Boggs reprogramming the Holo. Rue poised on her toes, arms slightly extended, like a bird about to take flight. On and on. We seal the pages with salt water and promises to live well to make their deaths count. Haymitch finally joins us, contributing twenty-three years of tributes he was forced to mentor. Additions become smaller. An old memory that surfaces. A late primrose preserved between the pages. Strange bits of happiness, like the photo of Finnick and Annie's newborn son.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我是从家传的那本植物书里得到了灵感。在一些地方见过的人、发生的事是不能光靠记忆的。于是，书先从一个人的照片开始，我们尽力找到照片，如果找不到，就由皮塔画一幅素描。然后，我凭借记忆把所有的细节都记下来，忘掉这些事情就如同犯罪。于是，书里出现了许多有趣的照片和素描，夫人在舔波丽姆的脸颊，爸爸在笑，皮塔的爸爸拿着甜点，芬尼克色彩漂亮的眼睛，西纳用一块丝绸布料在裁剪衣服，博格斯在使用霍罗，露露踮着脚尖、穸着两只胳膊，好似欲飞的小鸟，等等，等等。我们用盐水把画页封住，并且承诺一定不能让他们白白死去。黑密斯最后也参加进来，他贡献出二十三年以来指导过的“贡品”的照片。能加入的素材在渐渐减少，但一段过去的记忆又会带来新的素材，甚至晚开的樱草花都夹进了书里，算作书的一部分。还有幸福的点点滴滴，例如芬尼克和安妮新出生的儿子的照片。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Peeta and I grow back together. There are still moments when he clutches the back of a chair and hangs on until the flashbacks are over. I wake screaming from nightmares of mutts and lost children. But his arms are there to comfort me. And eventually his lips. On the night I feel that thing again, the hunger that overtook me on the beach, I know this would have happened anyway. That what I need to survive is not Gale's fire, kindled with rage and hatred. I have plenty of fire myself. What I need is the dandelion in the spring. The bright yellow that means rebirth instead of destruction. The promise that life can go on, no matter how bad our losses. That it can be good again. And only Peeta can give me that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="皮塔和我都在渐渐恢复。有时，旧病发作，他还需要抓住椅背，直到一切过去。我会因梦见可怕的变种动物或者那些死去的孩子而尖叫着醒来，可皮塔总在我的身边，伸出臂膀，给我以温暖。最后，他的臂膀变成了嘴唇。一天晚上，我又感到了那种奇妙的感觉，在沙滩上曾有过的那种感觉。我知道这一切迟早是会发生的。我活下去所需要的不是盖尔裹挟着愤怒和仇恨的火焰，我自己已经拥有了太多的火焰。我真正需要的是春天里的蒲公英，那鲜艳的黄色意味着重生而不是毁灭，无论我们失去了多少宝贵的东西，它确保生活能够继续下去，并告诉我们生活会好起来的。而只有皮塔能够给予我这一切。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We learn to keep busy again. Peeta bakes. I hunt. Haymitch drinks until the liquor runs out, and then raises geese until the next train arrives. Fortunately, the geese can take pretty good care of themselves. We're not alone. A few hundred others return because, whatever has happened, this is our home. With the mines closed, they plow the ashes into the earth and plant food. Machines from the Capitol break ground for a new factory where we will make medicines. Although no one seeds it, the Meadow turns green again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们又都让自己忙碌起来。皮塔烤面包，我打猎，黑密斯喝酒，直到所有的酒都喝光后，就去养鹅，一边等着下一列送酒的火车到达。好在，那些鹅也不用多管，能很好地照顾自己。我们不再孤独。又有几百人回到了家乡，无论发生什么，这里是我们的家。矿井已经关闭，于是人们开垦土地，种植粮食。从凯匹特运来了机械设备，我们这里又新开了一个制药厂。尽管没人打理“牧场”，但它重又恢复了生机。">查看中文翻译</div>
