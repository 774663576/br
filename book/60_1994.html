<div class="line_en">The reason we take that right for granted is that we stand at the top of the hierarchy. But let a third party enter the game -- a visitor from another planet, for example, someone to whom God says, Thou shalt have dominion over creatures of all other stars -- and all at once taking Genesis for granted becomes problematical. Perhaps a man hitched to the cart of a Martian or roasted on the spit by inhabitants of the Milky Way will recall the veal cutlet he used to slice on his dinner plate and apologize (belatedly!) to the cow.</div>

<div class="line_en">The very beginning of Genesis tells us that God created man in order to give him dominion over fish and fowl and all creatures. Of course, Genesis was written by a man, not a horse. There is no certainty that God actually did grant man dominion over other creatures. What seems more likely, in fact, is that man invented God to sanctify the dominion that he had usurped for himself over the cow and the horse. Yes, the right to kill a deer or a cow is the only thing all of mankind can agree upon, even during the bloodiest of wars.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="《创世记》的开篇写道，上帝造人是为了让人统治鸟、鱼、牲畜。当然，《创世记》是人写的，而不是一匹马写的。因此，并不能完全断定上帝是真的希望人类统治其他生物。更有可能是人类发明了上帝，以便使其篡夺来的对牛马的支配权合乎神圣法则。对，就是杀死一只鹿或一头母牛的权利，全人类只在这一点上达成共识，即使是在最血腥的战争年代亦不例外。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Along the way, they met a neighbor who was hurrying off to a cow shed in her rubber boots. The woman stopped long enough to ask, What's wrong with the dog?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="走到半路，特蕾莎和卡列宁遇到一位女邻居，她脚穿橡胶靴，正往牛栏走去。邻居停下步子，问道：“您的狗怎么啦？腿好像瘸了！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Walking along with her heifers, driving them in front of her, Tereza was constantly obliged to use discipline, because young cows are frisky and like to run off into the fields. Karenin kept her company. He had been going along daily to the pasture with her for two years. He always enjoyed being strict with the heifers, barking at them, asserting his authority. (His God had given him dominion over cows, and he was proud of it.) Today, however, he was having great trouble making his way, and hobbled along on three legs; the fourth had a wound on it, and the wound was festering. Tereza kept bending down and stroking his back. Two weeks after the operation, it became clear that the cancer had continued to spread and that Karenin would fare worse and worse.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特蕾莎和她的牛群向前走着，她赶着它们往前走，时不时地得对着一头呵斥几声，因为这些小母牛很调皮，常离群去田野里乱跑。卡列宁走在她身边，它这样日复一日地跟她放牛已经两个年头了。平时，它对母牛十分严厉，叫着追赶它们，训它们（上帝任命它管理牛群，它为此感到骄傲），很开心。可是今天，它步履艰难，用三只脚跳着走，另一条腿上的伤口还在流血。每隔两分钟，特蕾莎就俯下身去抚摩它的背。自手术后，两周已过去了，可是肿瘤显然未被控制住，卡列宁的病情在恶化。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It seems to be limping. He has cancer, said Tereza. There's no hope. And the lump in her throat kept her from going on. The woman noticed Tereza's tears and nearly lost her temper: Good heavens! Don't tell me you're going to bawl your head off over a dog! She was not being vicious; she was a kind woman and merely wanted to comfort Tereza. Tereza understood, and had spent enough time in the country to realize that if the local inhabitants loved every rabbit as she loved Karenin, they would be unable to kill any of them and they and their animals would soon starve to death. Still, the woman's words struck her as less than friendly. I understand, she answered without protest, but quickly turned her back and went her way. The love she bore her dog made her feel cut off, isolated. With a sad smile, she told herself that she needed to hide it more than she would an affair. People are indignant at the thought of someone loving a dog. But if the neighbor had discovered that Tereza had been unfaithful to Tomas, she would have given Tereza a playful pat on the back as a sign of secret solidarity.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特蕾莎回答：“它腿上长了个瘤子。它没救了。”她感到自己的嗓子哽住了，再也说不出话来。邻居一见特蕾莎落泪，几乎要生气了：“我的上帝，您总不至于为一条狗落泪吧？”她说这话并非出自恶意，其实她很善良，她这么说是为了安慰特蕾莎。对于这一点，特蕾莎很清楚，因为她来该村已经住了不少时日了，她知道，这儿的农民爱他们的兔子如同她爱卡列宁一样。他们舍不得杀死一只兔子，宁愿同它们一起挨饿。可是，邻居的话还是让她觉得不舒服，她并没有反驳，只回答说“我知道”，便急忙转过身，继续赶路了。她感到自己对卡列宁的爱是惟一的。她凄凉地微微一笑，想到必须隐藏这份感情，且带着更强烈的妒意，仿佛不得不隐瞒某个不忠的行为。因为爱上一条狗是件不光彩的事。要是女邻居知道她欺骗了托马斯，准会以同谋似的神情，乐呵呵地在她背上拍上一掌！">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Now, we may treat this definition as a joke and dismiss it with a condescending laugh. But since Tereza took it seriously, she found herself in a precarious position: her ideas were dangerous and distanced her from the rest of mankind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从这个定义，我们可以看出其简单的讽刺意味，并以宽容的态度一笑了之。可特蕾莎对此很认真，她走上了一条滑坡：这些想法十分危险，使她远离人类。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Even though Genesis says that God gave man dominion over all animals, we can also construe it to mean that He merely entrusted them to man's care. Man was not the planet's master, merely its administrator, and therefore eventually responsible for his administration. Descartes took a decisive step forward: he made man maitre et proprietaire de la nature. And surely there is a deep connection between that step and the fact that he was also the one who point-blank denied animals a soul. Man is master and proprietor, says Descartes, whereas the beast is merely an automaton, an animated machine, a machina animata. When an animal laments, it is not a lament; it is merely the rasp of a poorly functioning mechanism. When a wagon wheel grates, the wagon is not in pain; it simply needs oiling. Thus, we have no reason to grieve for a dog being carved up alive in the laboratory.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="《创世记》里已经写得清清楚楚：上帝派了人类去统治动物。但我们可以解释说，上帝只是借给人类这一权利。人类不是地球的拥有者而只是管理者，总有一天会意识到自己只是在管理地球。笛卡尔的观点更过分，他认为人类是“大自然的主人和所有者”。同时他也绝对否认动物有灵魂，这两者之中，无疑存在着深刻的逻辑性。按照他的观点，人类是所有者和主人，动物只是机器人，是台有生命的机器，即machina animata。动物痛苦时喊叫，那不是悲吟，不过是一台运转不正常的机器发出的咯吱声。当马车的车轮嘎吱作响时，这并不意味着马车有什么痛苦，而是没有上油的缘故。必须以这种方式来解释动物的呻吟，不应为一只在实验室里被活活解剖的狗哀叹。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Be that as it may, Tereza continued on her path, and, watching her heifers rub against one another, she thought what nice animals they were. Calm, guileless, and sometimes childishly animated, they looked like fat fifty-year-olds pretending they were fourteen. There was nothing more touching than cows at play. Tereza took pleasure in their antics and could not help thinking (it is an idea that kept coming back to her during her two years in the country) that man is as much a parasite on the cow as the tapeworm is on man: We have sucked their udders like leeches. Man the cow parasite is probably how non-man defines man in his zoology books.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是，特蕾莎赶着牛群继续向前走着，看见它们彼此蹭着背，特蕾莎心想这些牲畜真是可爱极了。这群牛性情温和，从不耍坏，有时表现得快乐而幼稚，简直就像那些假装是十四岁少女的五十开外的胖女人。它们嬉戏的时候，尤其令人感动不已。特蕾莎深情地注视着它们，心想（两年来，这一念头始终不可抵挡地萦绕着她）：人类就像寄生于人体的涤虫那样，靠母牛寄生：他们像蚂蟥紧叮着母牛的乳房。人类是母牛的寄生虫，这也许是非人类从他们的动物学角度给人类下的定义。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">While the heifers grazed, Tereza sat on a stump with Karenin at her side, his head resting in her lap. She recalled reading a two-line filler in the papers ten or so years ago about how all the dogs in a certain Russian city had been summarily shot. It was that inconspicuous and seemingly insignificant little article that had brought home to her for the first time the sheer horror of her country's oversized neighbor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="牛在草地吃草，特蕾莎坐在一个树墩上，卡列宁头靠在她膝上躺在她身边。特蕾莎想起十二年前在报上读到的一则只有两行字的短讯：说的是在俄罗斯的一座城市里，所有的狗都被杀光了。这则小消息似乎无关紧要，也不显眼，却使特蕾莎第一次感到那个邻近的大国很恐怖。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That little article was a premonition of things to come. The first years following the Russian invasion could not yet be characterized as a reign of terror. Because practically no one in the entire nation agreed with the occupation regime, the Russians had to ferret out the few exceptions and push them into power. But where could they look? All faith in Communism and love for Russia was dead. So they sought people who wished to get back at life for something, people with revenge on the brain. Then they had to focus, cultivate, and maintain those people's aggressiveness, give them a temporary substitute to practice on.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这便是后来所发生的一切事件的预兆；俄国人入侵后的头两年，人们还不能说什么恐惧。由于全国上下几乎都反对占领制度，俄国人非得从捷克人中找些新面孔，把他们扶上台掌权。可是，人们对俄国的爱都已成死灰，到哪里去找这些人呢？俄国人便看中了那些不惜性命图谋报复的人。他们得试探、训练并激发这些人的进攻性。首先得训练他们瞄准临时靶子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">All at once the papers started coming out with cycles of features and organized letters-to-the-editor campaigns demanding, for example, the extermination of all pigeons within city limits. And the pigeons would be exterminated. But the major drive was directed against dogs. People were still disconsolate over the catastrophe of the occupation, but radio, television, and the press went on and on about dogs: how they soil our streets and parks, endanger our children's health, fulfill no useful function, yet must be fed. They whipped up such a psychotic fever that Tereza had been afraid that the crazed mob would do harm to Karenin. Only after a year did the accumulated malice (which until then had been vented, for the sake of training, on animals) find its true goal: people. People started being removed from their jobs, arrested, put on trial. At last the animals could breathe freely.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="报上于是开始发表一系列文章，以读者来信的形式组织攻势。例如，要求杀尽灭绝城里的鸽子。鸽子确实被杀尽灭绝了。不过，他们的目标主要是狗。当时，人们尚未从国土被占领这一灾难所造成的精神创伤中解脱出来，但是报纸、广播、电视谈论的都是狗，说它们弄脏了人行道、公园，对儿童健康造成危害，是光会吃、毫无用途的东西。这一切制造了一种真正的偏执，特蕾莎担心狂热的民众会袭击卡列宁。过了一年，积聚起的所有仇恨（首先拿动物做试验），都转向了真正的目标：人类。开除、逮捕、审判开始了。牲畜总算可以喘口气了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tereza kept stroking Karenin's head, which was quietly resting in her lap, while something like the following ran through her mind: There's no particular merit in being nice to one's fellow man. She had to treat the other villagers decently, because otherwise she couldn't live there. Even with Tomas, she was obliged to behave lovingly because she needed him. We can never establish with certainty what part of our relations with others is the result of our emotions -- love, antipathy, charity, or malice -- and what part is predetermined by the constant power play among individuals.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特蕾莎抚摩着静静地躺在她膝头的卡列宁的头。她已基本认定这个道理：根本不值得跟自己的同类好。但她又不得不对其他村民以礼相待，否则便无法在这里呆下去，甚至对托马斯，她也是迫不得已，不得不表现得像个多情的妻子，因为她需要托马斯。幸好，我们同他人的关系在何种程度上取决于我们的感情，即我们的爱还是不爱，是善待还是仇视，而且，它们在何种程度预先受个人实力对比的制约，这是永远都无法下确切定义的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Tereza keeps appearing before my eyes. I see her sitting on the stump petting Karenin's head and ruminating on mankind's debacles. Another image also comes to mind: Nietzsche leaving his hotel in Turin. Seeing a horse and a coachman beating it with a whip, Nietzsche went up to the horse and, before the coachman's very eyes, put his arms around the horse's neck and burst into tears.</div>
