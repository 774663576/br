"Begging your pardon, m'lord, but we were all o' us getting splinters up our arses from sitting about."

<div class="line_en">It was no easy thing to send men into the wild, knowing that the chances were good that they might never return. They are all seasoned men, Jon told himself… but his uncle Benjen and his rangers had been seasoned men as well, and the haunted forest had swallowed them up without a trace. When two of them finally came straggling back to the Wall, it had been as wights. Not for the first time, or the last, Jon Snow found himself wondering what had become of Benjen Stark. Perhaps the rangers will come upon some sign of them, he told himself, never truly believing it.</div>

<div class="line_en">When the last of the riders had disappeared into the trees, Jon Snow rode the winch cage down with Dolorous Edd. A few scattered snowflakes were falling as they made their slow descent, dancing on the gusty wind. One followed the cage down, drifting just beyond the bars. It was falling faster than they were descending and from time to time would vanish beneath them. Then a gust of wind would catch it and push it upward once again. Jon could have reached through the bars and caught it if he had wished.</div>

<div class="line_en">Cotter Pyke's galleys were reporting ever-increasing numbers of free folk along the wooded shores to the north and east of the Wall. Camps had been seen, half-built rafts, even the hull of a broken cog that someone had begun repairing. The wildlings always vanished into the woods when seen, no doubt to reemerge as soon as Pyke's ships had passed. Meanwhile, Ser Denys Mallister was still seeing fires in the night north of the Gorge. Both commanders were asking for more men.</div>

<div class="line_en">And where am I to get more men? Jon had sent ten of the Mole's Town wildlings to each of them: green boys, old men, some wounded and infirm, but all capable of doing work of one sort or another. Far from being pleased, Pyke and Mallister had both written back to complain. "When I asked for men, I had in mind men of the Night's Watch, trained and disciplined, whose loyalty I should never have reason to doubt," wrote Ser Denys. Cotter Pyke was blunter. "I could hang them from the Wall as a warning to other wildlings to stay away, but I don't see any other use for them," Maester Harmune wrote for him. "I wouldn't trust such to clean my chamber pot, and ten is not enough."</div>

A black shield rimmed with iron for his left arm, a blunted longsword for his right hand. The sword gleamed silvery grey in the dawn light, almost new. One of the last to come from Donal's forge. A pity he did not live long enough to put an edge on it. The blade was shorter than Longclaw but made of common steel, which made it heavier. His blows would be a little slower. "It will serve." Jon turned to face his foes. "Come."</div>

Ser Rodrik too had fallen, slain by Theon Turncloak and his ironmen as he'd tried to retake Winterfell. The great stronghold of House Stark was a scorched desolation.

<div class="line_cn" title="当对方照做时琼恩的剑猛击在他头的一侧，把他掀翻了。一眨眼的功夫男孩就发现被一只靴子踩在胸口，一把剑顶在喉间。“战争从来不公平”，琼恩告诉他，“现在是二对一，而你死了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When he heard gravel crunch, he knew the twins were coming. Those two will make rangers yet. He spun, blocking Arron's cut with the edge of his shield and meeting Emrick's with his sword. "Those aren't spears," he shouted. "Get in close." He went to the attack to show them how it was done. Emrick first. He slashed at his head and shoulders, right and left and right again. The boy got his shield up and tried a clumsy countercut. Jon slammed his own shield into Emrick's, and brought him down with a blow to the lower leg… none too soon, because Arron was on him, with a crunching cut to the back of his thigh that sent him to one knee. That will leave a bruise. He caught the next cut on his shield, then lurched back to his feet and drove Arron across the yard. He's quick, he thought, as the longswords kissed once and twice and thrice, but he needs to get stronger. When he saw relief in Arron's eyes, he knew Emrick was behind him. He came around and dealt him a cut to the back of the shoulders that sent him crashing into his brother. By that time Jace had found his feet, so Jon put him down again. "I hate it when dead men get up. You'll feel the same the day you meet a wight." Stepping back, he lowered his sword.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他听到碎石响动，知道剩下的那对双胞胎攻来了。那两个是游骑兵的料。他转身，用他的盾沿架住艾隆的劈砍，用剑接住艾蒙克的削切。“那不是矛”，他大喊，“得近身。”他接着进行攻击好给他们演示怎么做。先是艾蒙克，琼恩在他头和肩膀上猛削，右、左、再到右。那男孩举起他的盾，笨拙的试着反削，琼恩用自己的盾猛砸对方的盾，并用一个扫下盘将对方击倒。恰在这时，艾隆攻了过来，一个大力削击打在他大腿后侧使他单腿跪下来。那会留下条淤痕的。他接住了接下来打在他盾上的劈砍，然后倾身向前立起把艾隆驱向校场另一边。他很快，他想到，在两把长剑接二连三的相碰时，但他需要练得更强壮。当他在艾隆眼里看到一抹放松时，他知道艾蒙克就在身后。他转过身来给了他一个肩背后的削击，使他撞向他的兄弟。这时Jace能站起来了，于是琼恩又把他放倒了一次。“我讨厌死人诈尸。你会有同样的感受，当你有一天碰到个白鬼的时候。”后退一步，他放低了他的剑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="琼恩迅速的逼向他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Rattleshirt took a step backwards and met the charge with a two-handed slash. If Jon had not interposed his shield, it might have staved his breast-plate in and broken half his ribs. The force of the blow staggered him for a moment and sent a solid jolt up his arm. He hits harder than I would have thought. His quickness was another unpleasant surprise. They circled round each other, trading blow for blow. The Lord of Bones gave as good as he was getting. By rights the two-handed greatsword should have been a deal more cumbersome than Jon's longsword, but the wildling wielded it with blinding speed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="叮当衫退了一步，用双手猛力一挥去接这一击。如果琼恩没用他的盾及时格挡，这一下可能已经击穿了他的胸甲、砍断他的肋骨。这一挥的力道使他踉跄了一瞬并给了他的手臂结结实实的一震。他的击打比我想的要猛烈。他的速度是另一件让人不快的意外。他们两人围着对方转，交替着劈砍。骨头之王使尽浑身解数。按理说双手重剑应该比琼恩的长剑显得笨重得多，但野人以近乎盲目的速度挥舞着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Iron Emmett's fledglings cheered their lord commander at the start, but the relentless speed of Rattleshirt's attack soon beat them down to silence. He cannot keep this up for long, Jon told himself as he stopped another blow. The impact made him grunt. Even dulled, the greatsword cracked his pinewood shield and bent the iron rim. He will tire soon. He must. Jon slashed at the wildling's face, and Rattleshirt pulled back his head. He hacked down at Rattleshirt's calf, only to have him deftly leap the blade. The greatsword crashed down onto Jon's shoulder, hard enough to ding his pouldron and numb the arm beneath. Jon backed away. The Lord of Bones came after, chortling. He has no shield, Jon reminded himself, and that monster sword's too cumbersome for parries. I should be landing two blows for every one of his.</div>

<div class="line_en">His chance came on Rattleshirt's next backswing. Jon threw himself forward, bulling into the other man, and they went down together, legs entangled. Steel slammed on steel. Both men lost their swords as they rolled on the hard ground. The wildling drove a knee between Jon's legs. Jon lashed out with a mailed fist. Somehow Rattleshirt ended up on top, with Jon's head in his hands. He smashed it against the ground, then wrenched his visor open. "If I had me a dagger, you'd be less an eye by now," he snarled, before Horse and Iron Emmett dragged him off the lord commander's chest. "Let go o' me, you bloody crows," he roared.</div>

The mist rose from her pale flesh, and for a moment it seemed as if pale, sorcerous flames were playing about her fingers. "Take my hand," she said again, "and let me save your sister."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“一个明智的女人。”梅丽珊卓站起身，他的红袍在风中激荡。“一把没柄的剑到底是一把剑，而当群敌环绕时，剑是件好东西。听我说，琼恩？雪诺。九只乌鸦飞进雪林为你寻找你的敌人。三个会死，他们还没死，但他们的死已经在等着他们，他们正骑马赶去。你把他们送进黑暗充作你的眼睛，但他们回来的时候会失去眼睛。我已经在我的火焰里看见他们苍白的死亡面孔。空空的洞，流着血。”她把她红色的头发向后拢，她红色的眼睛闪着光。“你不相信我。你会的。那相信的代价是三个生命。付给智慧的小小代价，有人会这么说…但是你本不需要支付的。记住这个，当你捧着你死去的人的瞎掉而破损的脸时。”雾气从她苍白的身周腾起，有那么一瞬间，看起来好像她手指上把玩着暗淡、妖异的火焰。“把你的手给我”，“让我救你的妹妹。”">查看中文翻译</div>

Arya. He turned back to the red priest-ess. Jon could feel her warmth. She has power.

Val's sister, Mance Rayder's wife. She said that sorcery was a sword without a hilt. There is no safe way to grasp it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="琼恩从肩膀上望了一眼。影子在那儿，正如她所说的，印在墙上的月光里。一个女孩穿着灰衣骑着一匹快死的马，他想。往这儿来，投奔你。艾莉亚。他回身转向女祭司，琼恩能感到她的热度。她有力量。这个念头油然产生，死死的攫住了他，但这不是一个他乐意受其恩惠的女人，哪怕为了他的小妹妹。“达拉，瓦迩的妹妹，曼斯雷德的妻子，曾告诉过我。她说巫术是把没柄的剑。没有什么安全的途径可以掌握它。”">查看中文翻译</div>
