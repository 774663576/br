<div class="line_en">Perhaps it's a kindness, Theon told himself as he stalked off in the other direction. Stygg was hardly the most expert of headsmen, and Benfred had a neck thick as a boar's, heavy with muscle and fat. I used to mock him for it, just to see how angry I could make him, he remembered. That had been, what, three years past? When Ned Stark had ridden to Torrhen's Square to see Ser Helman, Theon had accompanied him and spent a fortnight in Benfred's company.</div>

Down to the pebbled beach they would go, to drown Benfred Tallhart in salt water. The old way.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这席恩可受不了。“你是牧师，叔叔，我把神灵的事务都交给你。你也发发善心让我只管作战吧。”他挥挥手，斯提吉和魏拉格便把俘虏拖向海滩。湿发伊伦给了侄儿一个责难的目光，回头跟去。他们将走下鹅卵石的滩头，把本福德·陶哈溺死在盐水里。这是古道。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Climbing a jumble of stone, Theon looked down on the dead men and dying horses. The horses had deserved better. Tymor and his brothers had gathered up what mounts had come through the fight unhurt, while Urzen and Black Lorren silenced the animals too badly wounded to be saved. The rest of his men were looting the corpses. Gevin Harlaw knelt on a dead man's chest, sawing off his finger to get at a ring. Paying the iron price. My lord father would approve. Theon thought of seeking out the bodies of the two men he'd slain himself to see if they had any jewelry worth the taking, but the notion left a bitter taste in his mouth. He could imagine what Eddard Stark would have said. Yet that thought made him angry too. Stark is dead and rotting, and naught to me, he reminded himself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="席恩爬上一座乱石冈，俯瞰下方的尸体和死马。马的待遇比较好，泰莫兄弟把战斗中未受伤的马都聚集起来，乌兹和黑罗伦则把伤势过重的马匹一一砍杀。他的其他部下在尸体上掠夺战利品。吉文·哈尔洛跪在死人胸前锯对方指头，以攫取戒指。这就是付铁钱，这就是父亲赞许的方式。席恩盘算着前去搜刮自己杀的那两人，看看有什么值钱东西好拿，但一念及此，嘴边却油然滋生一抹淡淡的苦味。他仿佛能听到艾德·史塔克的评语。这种想像让他非常生气。史塔克死了烂掉了，他什么也不是，席恩反复提醒自己。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He could hear the rough noises of victory from the crook in the road where the battle had been fought… if you'd go so far as to call it a battle. More like slaughtering sheep, if truth be told. Sheep fleeced in steel, but sheep nonetheless.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Wex, my bow and quiver." The boy ran and fetched them. Theon bent the bow and slipped the string into its notches as Todric knocked down the Botley boy and flung ale into his eyes. Fishwhiskers leapt up cursing, but Theon was quicker. He drew on the hand that clutched the drinking horn, figuring to give them a shot to talk about, but Todric spoiled it by lurching to one side just as he loosed. The arrow took him through the belly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“威克斯，弓箭给我。”男孩跑过来递上弓。席恩弯弓搭箭，静静地看着托德利克击倒波特里的孩子，并把酒泼进他的眼睛。鱼胡子咒骂着扑上去，但席恩更快。他的目标是握角杯的手，好让他们坐下来谈判，可他出手时，托德利克摇晃着滑了一跤。不偏不倚，利箭穿膛而过。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The looters stopped to gape. Theon lowered his bow. "No drunkards, I said, and no squabbles over plunder." On his knees, Todric was dying noisily. "Botley, silence him." Fishwhiskers and his sons were quick to obey. They slit Todric's throat as he kicked feebly, and were stripping him of cloak and rings and weapons before he was even dead.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所有人都停下来瞪着他。席恩放低弓箭，“我说过，我不要酒鬼，不许为战利品争执。”托德利克跪倒在地，发出垂死的惨嚎。“波特里，干掉他。”鱼胡子和他的儿子们即刻上前，压制住托德利克无力的踢打，割开他的喉咙，在人断气之前便活活剥下了斗篷、戒指和武器。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Now they know I mean what I say. Lord Balon might have given him the command, but Theon knew that some of his men saw only a soft boy from the green lands when they looked at him. "Anyone else have a thirst?" No one replied. "Good." He kicked at Benfred's fallen banner, clutched in the dead hand of the squire who'd borne it. A rabbitskin had been tied below the flag. Why rabbitskins? he had meant to ask, but being spat on had made him forget his questions. He tossed his bow back to Wex and strode off, remembering how elated he'd felt after the Whispering Wood, and wondering why this did not taste as sweet. Tallhart, you bloody overproud fool, you never even sent out a scout.</div>

<div class="line_en">They'd been joking and even singing as they'd come on, the three trees of Tallhart streaming above them while rabbitskins flapped stupidly from the points of their lances. The archers concealed behind the gorse had spoiled the song with a rain of arrows, and Theon himself had led his men-at-arms out to finish the butcher's work with dagger, axe, and warhammer. He had ordered their leader spared for questioning.</div>

<div class="line_en">His thrice-damned sister was sailing her Black Wind north even now, sure to win a castle of her own. Lord Balon had let no word of the hosting escape the Iron Islands, and Theon's bloody work along the Stony Shore would be put down to sea raiders out for plunder. The northmen would not realize their true peril, not until the hammers fell on Deepwood Motte and Moat Cailin. And after all is done and won, they will make songs for that bitch Asha, and forget that I was even here. That is, if he allowed it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此刻，他那挨千刀的姐姐正驾驶黑风号北上，将为自己赢取一座城堡。她的胜算极大，巴隆大王没让铁群岛集结军队的消息走漏半点风声，而他席恩在磐石海岸干的这些龌龊勾当无疑将使人们以为这只是古老海盗们的又一次掠夺蠢动。北方人不会意识到真正的危险所在，直到深林堡和卡林湾被一一占领。但到了那时，一切都结束了，我们赢了，人们将永远歌颂婊子阿莎，而我的事迹无人铭记。假如我就这样碌碌无为，事情的结局就是如此。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His limp body was being dragged from the surf when Theon returned to his Sea Bitch. The masts of his longships stood outlined against the sky along the pebbled beach. Of the fishing village, nothing remained but cold ashes that stank when it rained. The men had been put to the sword, all but a handful that Theon had allowed to flee to bring the word to Torrhen's Square. Their wives and daughters had been claimed for salt wives, those who were young enough and fair. The crones and the ugly ones had simply been raped and killed, or taken for thralls if they had useful skills and did not seem likely to cause trouble.</div>

<div class="line_en">"The day is won," Dagmer called down. "And yet you do not smile, boy. The living should smile, for the dead cannot." He smiled himself to show how it was done. It made for a hideous sight. Under a snowy white mane of hair, Dagmer Cleftjaw had the most gut-churning scar Theon had ever seen, the legacy of the longaxe that had near killed him as a boy. The blow had splintered his jaw, shattered his front teeth, and left him four lips where other men had but two. A shaggy beard covered his cheeks and neck, but the hair would not grow over the scar, so a shiny seam of puckered, twisted flesh divided his face like a crevasse through a snowfield. "We could hear them singing," the old warrior said. "It was a good song, and they sang it bravely."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“今天是胜利之日，”达格摩从高处喊，“可你脸上却没有笑容，小子。活着的人理应欢笑，因为死者无法做到。”为了示范，他自己笑了笑。可怕极了。在雪白披散的长发下，裂颚达格摩有席恩这辈子所见最为心惊的伤疤。据说达格摩小时候差点被长斧砍死，那一击粉碎了下巴，打掉了前齿，所以常人是两片唇，他则成了四片。杂乱的胡须覆盖了他的脸庞和颈项，只有那伤痕附近，什么也不长，惟有一道又皱又亮的疤痕，翻卷着脸上的皮肉，如同冰川上撕裂的峡谷。“我在这里都能听见他们唱歌，”老战士说，“唱得不错，唱得勇猛。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You and I must talk, Uncle," Theon said. Dagmer was no true uncle, only a sworn man with perhaps a pinch of Greyjoy blood four or five lives back, and that from the wrong side of the blanket. Yet Theon had always called him uncle nonetheless.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们得谈谈，叔叔。”席恩说。其实达格摩不是他亲叔叔，只是父亲的部属，四五代前似乎有那么一点葛雷乔伊的血统，还是从私通苟合中得来。虽然如此，席恩仍旧一直喊他叔叔。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ugly as it was, that smile brought back a hundred memories. Theon had seen it often as a boy, when he'd jumped a horse over a mossy wall, or flung an axe and split a target square. He'd seen it when he blocked a blow from Dagmer's sword, when he put an arrow through a seagull on the wing, when he took the tiller in hand and guided a longship safely through a snarl of foaming rocks. He gave me more smiles than my father and Eddard Stark together. Even Robb… he ought to have won a smile the day he'd saved Bran from that wildling, but instead he'd gotten a scolding, as if he were some cook who'd burned the stew.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="笑容虽丑，却牵起席恩无数的回忆。幼童时代，这笑容伴随着他，每当他驱策小马跨过生苔的矮墙，每当他掷出飞斧击中竖立的靶标，每当他挡下达格摩的攻击，每当他射中海鸥的翅膀，每当他操纵舵柄指引长船穿过纠结的暗礁，这笑容总是不离左右。他给我的笑，比父亲、比艾德·史塔克给的都多，甚至比罗柏…那天他从野人手中拯救布兰，本该赢得微笑，结果却是责骂，仿佛他才是始作俑者。">查看中文翻译</div>
