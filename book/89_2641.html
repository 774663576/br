<div class="line_en">But she doesn't sleep, because she remembers the thick layer of dust on the floor of the recreation center before she started cleaning, and if she dies in her sleep she's certainly not going to risk lying here until she starts smelling and gets all covered in dust. Sleeping on one of the sofas in the corner of the recreation center is not even worth thinking about, because they were so filthy that Britt-Marie had to wear double latex gloves when she covered them with baking soda. Maybe she could have slept in the car? Maybe, if she were an animal.</div>

<div class="line_en">Once, Kent made a mistake about the check-in time for the flight when they were going home after a hotel visit, although Kent still maintains that "those sods can't even write the correct time on the sodding ticket," and they had to run off in the middle of the night without even having time to take a shower. So, just before Britt-Marie rushed out of the door, she ran into the bathroom to turn on the shower for a few seconds so there would be water on the floor when the cleaning staff came, and they would therefore not come to the conclusion that the guests in Room 423 had set off wearing their own dirt.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有一次在外地，肯特记错了返程的登机时间，（他还振振有词地声辩：“是那些王八蛋把王八蛋机票上的时间打错了。”）等两人发现他们必须半夜赶到机场时，已经来不及在旅馆里冲个澡再走了。于是，在匆忙离开旅馆的前一刻，急中生智的布里特—玛丽跑进浴室，拧开花洒，让水往地上流了几秒钟，这样清洁工进房打扫时会发现浴室地面有水，等到他们开讨论会时，就不会得出“423号房间的客人没洗澡就跑了”之类的结论了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Anytime she and Kent are staying at a hotel she always puts up the "Do Not Disturb" sign, and then makes the bed and cleans the room herself. It's not because she judges people, not at all; it's because she knows that the cleaning staff could very well be the sort of people who judge people, and Britt-Marie certainly doesn't want to run the risk of the cleaning staff sitting in a meeting in the evening discussing the horrible state of Room 423.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="每当和肯特外出住旅馆时，她总会先在门外挂上“请勿打扰”的牌子，然后亲自铺床、整理房间，并非她看不上别人的服务，或是忍不住说三道四，而是因为她知道清洁工可能正是热衷说三道四的人，她可不想让清洁工们晚上凑在一起点评423号房间住客的生活习惯。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Britt-Marie doesn't know when their marriage slipped out of her hands. When it became worn and scratched up no matter how many coasters she used. Once he used to hold her hand when they slept, and she dreamed his dreams. Not that Britt-Marie didn't have any dreams of her own; it was just that his were bigger, and the one with the biggest dreams always wins in this world. She had learned that. So she stayed home to take care of his children, without even dreaming of having any of her own. She stayed home another few years to make a presentable home and support him in his career, without dreaming of her own. She found she had neighbors who called her a "nag-bag" when she worried about what the Germans would think if there was rubbish in the foyer or the stairwell smelled of pizza. She made no friends of her own, just the odd acquaintance, usually the wife of one of Kent's business associates.</div>

<div class="line_en">Kent's children liked her, she thinks, but children become adults and adults refer to women of Britt-Marie's type as nag-bags. From time to time there were other children living on their block; occasionally Britt-Marie got to cook them dinner if they were home alone. But the children always had mothers or grandmothers who came home at some point, and then they grew up and Britt-Marie became a nag-bag. Kent kept saying she was socially incompetent and she assumed this had to be right. In the end all she dreamed of was a balcony and a husband who did not walk on the parquet in his golf shoes, who occasionally put his shirt in the laundry basket without her having to ask him to do it, and who now and then said he liked the food without her having to ask. A home. Children who, although they weren't her own, came for Christmas in spite of everything. Or at least tried to pretend they had a decent reason not to. A correctly organized cutlery drawer. An evening at the theater every now and again. Windows you could see the world through. Someone who noticed that Britt-Marie had taken special care with her hair. Or at least pretended to notice. Or at least let Britt-Marie go on pretending.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她觉得肯特的孩子喜欢她，可孩子们会长大，长成大人的孩子会叫她这样的女人“絮叨婆”。她居住的街区也有别的孩子，他们独自待在家里时，布里特—玛丽偶尔会给他们做饭。可这些小孩家的大人们总会回家，等他们长大后，布里特—玛丽就成了他们眼中的“絮叨婆”。肯特老说她缺乏社交能力，她觉得他说得肯定对。最终，她的全部梦想化作一个阳台和一个不会穿着高尔夫球鞋在镶木地板上走来走去的丈夫，他偶尔会自觉把衬衫丢进洗衣篮，无需她提醒，有时候不用她问就主动表达一下自己对饭菜的喜欢。她想要一个家，希望孩子们（虽然不是她生的）无论如何都能回家过圣诞节，即便不来，也至少找个说得过去的理由。她想要井井有条的餐具抽屉，时常去剧院看场戏，想要能看到外面世界的干净窗户，希望某个人会注意到她精心打理的发型，或者至少假装注意到了，或者至少，允许布里特—玛丽去假装。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One of them once offered to help Britt-Marie with the washing-up after a dinner party, and then she set about sorting Britt-Marie's cutlery drawer with knives on the left, then spoons and forks. When Britt-Marie asked, in a state of shock, what she was doing, the acquaintance laughed as if it was a joke, and said, "Does it really matter?" They were no longer acquainted. Kent said that Britt-Marie was socially incompetent, so she stayed home for another few years so he could be social on behalf of the both of them. A few years turned into more years, and more years turned into all years. Years have a habit of behaving like that. It's not that Britt-Marie chose not to have any expectations, she just woke up one morning and realized they were past their sell-by date.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有次晚餐聚会结束后，其中一位熟人自告奋勇帮助布里特—玛丽清洗餐具，接着又开始整理布里特—玛丽的餐具抽屉——先把餐刀放到最左边，再依次摆放勺子和叉子。布里特—玛丽惊恐地质问她怎么可以这样做，熟人笑着说：“这有什么要紧？”简直不把排列餐具的正确顺序放在眼里——自此她们的熟人关系宣告结束。肯特说布里特—玛丽不够随和，所以她又在家里待了几年，让肯特代表他们两个人社交，充分表现他的随和。后来，“几年”变成了“更多年”，“更多年”变成了“一辈子”，事情往往就是这样。并非布里特—玛丽选择不去期待什么，只是某天早晨醒来，她突然意识到所有的期待都过了保质期。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Britt-Marie turns on the light at six o'clock the following morning. Not because she's really missing the light, but because people may have noticed the light was on last night, and if they've realized Britt-Marie has spent the night at the recreation center she doesn't want them thinking she's still asleep at this time of the morning.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天早晨六点，布里特—玛丽准时打开厨房的灯。她其实并不需要照明，只是因为可能有人注意到了昨晚的灯光，知道她在娱乐中心过夜，如果这时不开灯，别人会觉得她太懒，这么晚了还不起床。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There's an old television by the sofas, which she could turn on to feel less lonely, but she avoids it because there will most likely be soccer on it. There's always soccer nowadays, and faced with that option Britt-Marie would actually prefer to be lonely. The recreation center encloses her in a guarded silence. The coffee percolator lies on its side and no longer blinks at her. She sits on the stool in front of it, remembering how Kent's children said Britt-Marie was "passive-aggressive." Kent laughed in the way that he did after drinking vodka and orange in front of a soccer match, his stomach bouncing up and down and the laughter gushing forth in little snorting bursts through his nostrils, and then he replied: "She ain't bloody passive-aggressive, she's aggressive-passive!" And then he laughed until he spilled vodka on the shagpile rug.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="沙发那儿有台旧电视，也许打开电视就不会感到孤单了。可她不敢开，因为害怕屏幕上出现足球。足球是现今的热门话题，与看球相比，布里特—玛丽宁愿选择孤独。娱乐中心的寂静仿佛是她的保镖，为她带来安全感。滴漏式咖啡壶依旧倒在台面上，不再对她眨眼睛。她坐在咖啡壶前的木凳上，想起肯特的孩子们形容她“消极挑衅”，肯特听后乐不可支，就像他在看球赛时喝饱了伏特加和果汁之后那样哈哈大笑起来：肚皮上下起伏，几乎喘不动气，笑声中偶尔夹杂着猪哼一样的鼻音。笑了好一会儿之后，他评论道：“她才不是什么狗屁的‘消极挑衅’呢，是为了消极而挑衅！”接着他又笑起来，直到把果汁洒在长绒地毯上才作罢。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She looks at the coffee percolator. For a fleeting, carefree moment the thought occurs to her that she might try to mend it, but she comes to her senses and moves away from it. She hasn't mended anything since she was married. It was always best to wait until Kent came home, she felt. Kent always said, "women can't even put together IKEA furniture," when they watched women in television programs about house building or renovation. "Quota-filling," he used to call it. Britt-Marie liked sitting next to him on the sofa solving the crossword. Always so close to the remote control that she could feel the tips of his fingers against her knee when he fumbled with it to flip the channel to a soccer match.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她凝视着咖啡壶，突发奇想：要不要试着修好它？然而这个想法稍纵即逝，她很快便恢复了理智，把它赶出自己的脑海。自从结婚以来，她没修理过任何东西，每次都觉得，最明智的做法就是等肯特回来修。每当电视上播出的搭建或装修类节目中出现女人时，肯特总说：“女人连宜家的家具都组装不了。”他觉得这是“先天决定的”。布里特—玛丽喜欢和他一起坐在沙发上，肯特看电视，她就默默地玩填字游戏，遥控器放在腿边，等待肯特摸索遥控器，准备换台看球赛时，指尖经常碰到她的膝盖。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“这种酒好是好，就是有很多…叫什么来着？杂质！得用咖啡滤纸过滤几次，嗯，然后就能喝了！”她熟门熟路地解释道，接着便瞥见布里特—玛丽的行李箱和地板上的花盆，于是笑得更灿烂了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Somebody propels her chair forward and tugs at the kitchen drawers until she finds the coffee filters.</div>

<div class="line_en">She stops herself when she notices the coffee percolator. The remains of it, at least. Britt-Marie, filled with discomfort, clasps her hands together over her stomach and looks as if she'd like to brush some invisible specks of dust from the opening of a black hole, and then sink into it herself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她突然停下轮椅，盯着那个滴漏式咖啡壶——或者说是咖啡壶的残骸。布里特—玛丽浑身不自在，两手交叉，紧紧地扣在肚子上，像是想找个地洞，把洞边上那些看不见的灰尘拂掉，再跳进去躲起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What… happened?" asks Somebody, eyeing first the mop and then the mop-sized dents in the coffee percolator. Britt-Marie stands in silence, with flaming cheeks. She may quite possibly be thinking about Kent. Finally she clears her throat, straightens her back and looks Somebody right in the eye as she answers:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这是…怎么回事？”女人问。她先看看拖把，又把目光转向咖啡壶上那些和拖把柄端完美吻合的凹坑。布里特—玛丽沉默地站着，脸像被火烧过。她很可能在想肯特。终于，她清清嗓子，挺直腰杆，盯着女人的眼睛回答：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then she starts laughing. Loudly. Then coughing. Then laughing even louder. Britt-Marie is deeply offended. It wasn't meant to be funny. At least Britt-Marie doesn't think it was; she hasn't said anything that was supposed to be funny in years, as far as she can remember. So she's offended by the laughter, because she assumes it's at her expense and not because of the actual joke. It's the sort of thing you assume if you've spent a sufficient amount of time with a husband who is constantly trying to be funny. There was not space in their relationship for more hilarity than his. Kent was funny and Britt-Marie went into the kitchen and took care of the washing-up. That was how they divided up their responsibilities.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着她便笑了起来，笑得很大声，然后开始咳嗽，咳嗽完之后又笑，声音比先前更大了。布里特—玛丽深受冒犯：这根本没什么好笑的，至少她这么想。她记得自己已经有许多年没说过惹人发笑的话了，笑声很容易让她受到冒犯，因为她觉得对方是在取笑自己。如果你有一个随时都想表现幽默感，却不允许妻子比自己诙谐的丈夫，就更容易产生这样的倾向。在他们家，肯特负责搞笑，布里特—玛丽负责做饭和打扫。这就是他们的分工。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But now Somebody sits here laughing so much that her wheelchair almost topples over. This makes Britt-Marie insecure, and her natural reaction to insecurity is irritation.
