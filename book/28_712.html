<div class="line_en">My dad drove me to Princeton in the summer of 1981, across the flat highways connecting Illinois to New Jersey. But it was more than a simple father-daughter road trip. My boyfriend, David, came along for the ride. I'd been invited to attend a special three-week summer orientation program, meant to close a "preparation gap," giving certain incoming freshmen extra time and help settling into college. It was unclear exactly how we were identified -- what part of our admissions applications had tipped the university off to the idea that we might benefit from lessons on how to read a syllabus or advance practice navigating the pathways between campus buildings -- but Craig had done it two years earlier, and it seemed like an opportunity. So I packed up my stuff, said good-bye to my mom -- neither of us teary or sentimental -- and climbed into the car.</div>

<div class="line_en">My eagerness to leave town was fueled in part by the fact I'd spent the last couple of months working an assembly-line job, operating what was basically an industrial-sized glue gun at a small bookbinding factory in downtown Chicago -- a soul-killing routine that went on for eight hours a day, five days a week, and served as possibly the single most reinforcing reminder that going to college was a good idea. David's mom worked at the bookbindery and had helped get the two of us jobs there. We'd worked shoulder to shoulder all summer, which made the whole endeavor more palatable. David was smart and gentle, a tall, good-looking guy who was two years older than I was. He'd first befriended Craig on the neighborhood basketball court in Rosenblum Park a few years earlier, joining pickup games when he came to visit relatives who lived on Euclid Parkway. Eventually, he started hanging around with me. During the school year, David went away to college out of state, which conveniently kept him from being any sort of distraction from my studies. During holiday breaks and over the summer, though, he came home to stay with his mom on the far southwest side of the city and drove over almost every day to pick me up in his car.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我离家心切的一个原因是，在那之前几个月，我一直在芝加哥市区的一家小型装订厂的流水线上工作，操作着一把工业用胶枪，每天工作八小时，一周五天，工作乏味得让人想自杀。不过这也让我更加觉得上大学是个好主意。大卫的母亲在那家装订厂上班，是她帮我们俩找到了这份工作。我们整个夏天都在并肩作战，因此工作变得还可以忍受。大卫比我大两岁，他聪明而温柔，是个高个子的英俊男孩。他和克雷格先成了朋友，那是几年前，大卫过来看望他住在“欧几里得林荫路”小区的亲戚，在罗森布朗公园的篮球场上认识了克雷格。最后，我们俩成了男女朋友。我上高中的时候，大卫到州外读大学，刚好没有成为我学业上的干扰因素。但在节假日和夏天，他会回到位于芝加哥西南远郊的家和他母亲一起住，并且几乎每天都开车过来找我一起外出。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">David was easygoing and also more of an adult than any boyfriend I'd had. He sat on the couch and watched ball games with my father. He joked around with Craig and made polite conversation with my mom. We went on real dates, going for what we considered upscale dinners at Red Lobster and to the movies. We fooled around and smoked pot in his car. By day at the bookbindery, we glue gunned our way into a companionable oblivion, wisecracking until there was nothing left to say. Neither of us was particularly invested in the job, beyond trying to save up money for school. I'd be leaving town soon anyway, and had little intention of ever coming back to the bookbinding plant. In a sense, I was already half departed -- my mind flown off in the direction of Princeton.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大卫脾气随和，比我之前交往过的男朋友成熟。他会坐在沙发上和我父亲一起看球赛，跟克雷格开玩笑，同我母亲礼貌地聊天。我们有过真正的约会，去红龙虾餐厅吃我们认为高档的晚餐，还去看电影。我们在他的车里亲热。白天在装订厂，我们拿着胶枪边干活边聊天，旁若无人地说着俏皮话，直到最后无话可说。我们两个对这份工作都算不上投入，只是想攒点上大学的生活费。我反正很快就要离开，也不打算再回到这家装订厂。从某种意义上说，我已经离开了，我的心已经飞往了普林斯顿的方向。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Which is to say that on the early August evening when our father-daughter-boyfriend trio finally pulled off Route 1 and turned onto the wide leafy avenue leading to campus, I was fully ready to get on with things. I was ready to cart my two suitcases into the summer-session dorm, ready to pump the hands of the other kids who'd come (minority and low-income students primarily, with a few athletes mixed in). I was ready to taste the dining-hall food, memorize the campus map, and conquer whatever syllabi they wanted to throw my way. I was there. I had landed. I was seventeen years old, and my life was under way.</div>

<div class="line_en">There was only one problem, and that was David, who as soon as we crossed the state line from Pennsylvania had begun to look a little doleful. As we wrestled my luggage out of the back of my dad's car, I could tell he was feeling lonely already. We'd been dating for over a year. We'd professed love, but it was love in the context of Euclid Avenue and Red Lobster and the basketball courts at Rosenblum Park. It was love in the context of the place I'd just left. While my father took his customary extra minute to get out of the driver's seat and steady himself on his canes, David and I stood wordlessly in the dusk, surveying the immaculate diamond of green lawn outside my stone fortress of a dorm. It was hitting us both, I assumed, that there were perhaps important things we hadn't discussed, that we had perhaps divergent views on whether this was a temporary farewell or an outright, geographically induced breakup. Were we going to visit? Write love letters? How hard were we going to work at this?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="只有一个问题，那就是大卫。我们从宾夕法尼亚州一进入新泽西州，他看上去有一点儿沮丧。当我们把行李从车的后备厢里拿出来时，很明显，他已经感到孤独了。我们交往了一年多的时间。我们彼此表达过爱意，但我们恋爱的环境是欧几里得大道、红龙虾餐厅和罗森布朗公园的篮球场，也就是我刚刚离开的地方。当父亲像往常一样费力地从驾驶座上站起来，拄着他的手杖站定时，我和大卫站在暮色中，相对无言。看着面前那片像绿宝石一样干净整洁的草坪，旁边就是我要入住的石头城堡似的宿舍，我想，我们当时都突然意识到，我们俩可能还有一些重要的事情没有讨论。这次是短暂的分别，还是因为分隔两地而彻底地分手，我们也许有不同看法。我们还会去看望对方吗？会写情书吗？如果要保持恋爱关系难度有多大？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">David held my hand in an earnest way. It was confusing. I knew what I wanted but couldn't find the words. I hoped that someday my feelings for a man would knock me sideways, that I'd get swept into the upending, tsunami-like rush that seemed to power all the best love stories. My parents had fallen in love as teenagers. My dad took my mother to her high school prom, even. I knew that teenage affairs were sometimes real and lasting. I wanted to believe that there was a guy who'd materialize and become everything to me, who'd be sexy and solid and whose effect would be so immediate and deep that I'd be willing to rearrange my priorities.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大卫紧紧地握着我的手。事情有点混乱。我知道我要什么，但我不知道用什么言语表达。我希望有一天，我对一个男人的感觉会让我不顾一切，让我陷入一场暴风骤雨般的冲动中，就像所有最美好的爱情故事中描写的那样。我的父母在十几岁的时候爱上对方，他们还一起参加了母亲学校的高中毕业舞会。我明白十几岁时的爱情有时也是真实且长久的。我相信会有一个人出现并成为我的一切，他性感、可靠，对我的影响直接而深沉，让我愿意为他做出牺牲和妥协。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And yet I knew. I knew that while I had my arms around a good-hearted Chicago guy who genuinely cared about me, there was also, just beyond us, a lit path leading out of the parking lot and up a slight hill toward the quad, which would in a matter of minutes become my new context, my new world. I was nervous about living away from home for the first time, about leaving the only life I'd ever known. But some part of me understood it was better to make a clean, quick break and not hold on to anything. The next day David would call me at my dorm, asking if we could meet up for a quick meal or a final walk around town before he left, and I would mumble something about how busy I was already at school, how I didn't think it would work. Our good-bye that night was for real and forever. I probably should have said it directly in the moment, but I chickened out, knowing it would hurt, both to say and to hear. Instead, I just let him go.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是我清楚，虽然我现在正抱着一个真正关心我的善良的芝加哥男孩，但就在不远处，一条灯火通明的小道从停车场通向一座小山丘，后边是一个方形的庭院，几分钟之后，那里将是我的新环境、我的新世界。我感觉有点紧张，这是我第一次离家住校，离开我唯一熟悉的生活。但是我心里明白，长痛不如短痛，干脆利落地分手是更好的选择。第二天，大卫打电话到我的宿舍，问在他走之前我能不能出来吃个便饭或者我们能否在城里最后一起散散步，而我咕哝着说了些我在学校很忙、觉得两地恋爱行不通的话。我们那天晚上的告别是最后的告别。我当时就应该直接跟他说，但是我没有勇气，那样的话，说的人和听的人都会很伤心。所以，我就让他那样离开了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It turned out there were a lot of things I had yet to learn about life, or at least life on the Princeton campus in the early 1980s. After I spent several energizing weeks as a summer student, surrounded by a few dozen other kids who seemed both accessible and familiar to me, the fall semester officially began, opening the floodgates to the student population at large. I moved my belongings into a new dorm room, a one-room triple in Pyne Hall, and then watched through my third-floor window as several thousand mostly white students poured onto campus, carting stereos and duvet sets and racks of clothes. Some kids arrived in limos. One girl brought two limos -- stretch limos -- to accommodate all her stuff.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我发现，原来生活中有许多事情我都不了解，最起码对20世纪80年代初普林斯顿的校园生活不了解。作为暑期培训生的几周过得忙碌而充实，周围十几个孩子都是好相处且让我觉得熟悉的类型。接着，秋季学期正式拉开了帷幕，学校迎来了大批的学生。我把东西搬到了新宿舍，那是派恩楼的一个三人间。我从宿舍三楼的窗户看到有几千名学生拥入校园，大部分都是白人，他们带着音响、羽绒床品和一架架的衣服。有些学生是坐着豪华轿车来的。一个女孩甚至有两辆豪华轿车随行，而且是超长的那种，里面装的都是她的行李。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Princeton was extremely white and very male. There was no avoiding the facts. Men on campus outnumbered women almost two to one. Black students made up less than 9 percent of my freshman class. If during the orientation program we'd begun to feel some ownership of the space, we were now a glaring anomaly -- poppy seeds in a bowl of rice. While Whitney Young had been somewhat diverse, I'd never been part of a predominantly white community before. I'd never stood out in a crowd or a classroom because of the color of my skin. It was jarring and uncomfortable, at least at first, like being dropped into a strange new terrarium, a habitat that hadn't been built for me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="普林斯顿的白人和男生占绝对优势，这一点无法回避。学校里男生的数量几乎是女生的两倍。在我入学那年的新生中，黑人学生的占比只有不到百分之九。如果说在参加培训项目时，我们感觉自己是学校的主人，那么现在我们是扎眼的少数派，就像一碗白米饭里的几粒罂粟种子一样。惠特尼·扬高中的学生是比较混杂的。我从未置身于一个白人占多数的社区，也从未因为自己的肤色而在人群中或教室里引人注目。这让人不安、不舒服，起码开始时是这样，我就像被丢进了一个奇怪的新玻璃容器，一个不属于我的环境。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As with anything, though, you learn to adapt. Some of the adjustment was easy -- a relief almost. For one thing, nobody seemed much concerned about crime. Students left their rooms unlocked, their bikes casually kickstanded outside buildings, their gold earrings unattended on the sink in the dorm bathrooms. Their trust in the world seemed infinite, their forward progress in it entirely assured. For me, it was something to get used to. I'd spent years quietly guarding my possessions on the bus ride to and from Whitney Young. Walking home to Euclid Avenue in the evenings, I carried my house key wedged between two knuckles and pointed outward, in case I needed it to defend myself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，就像任何事一样，你要学会适应。有些适应是容易的，甚至能让人安心。首先，这里似乎没有人担心犯罪问题。学生房间的门经常不锁，自行车随意地停在楼外，女生们的金耳环就扔在宿舍的洗手池上。他们似乎对这个世界有无限的信任，他们在这世间大踏步前行似乎完全有保障。而对我来说，这需要适应。几年来，我在往返惠特尼·扬的公交车上，一直默默地看管着自己的东西。晚上回家走在欧几里得大道上时，我手里会拿着家中的钥匙，钥匙尖冲外，随时准备保护自己。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At Princeton, it seemed the only thing I needed to be vigilant about was my studies. Everything otherwise was designed to accommodate our well-being as students. The dining halls served five different kinds of breakfast. There were enormous spreading oak trees to sit under and open lawns where we could throw Frisbees to relieve our stress. The main library was like an old-world cathedral, with high ceilings and glossy hardwood tables where we could lay out our textbooks and study in silence. We were protected, cocooned, catered to. A lot of kids, I was coming to realize, had never in their lifetimes known anything different.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在普林斯顿，唯一需要担心的事情就是学业。周围的一切都是为服务于学生而设计的。食堂有五种不同种类的早餐。我们可以坐在亭亭如盖的大橡树下或者在开放的草坪上扔飞盘减压。学校的主图书馆建得像一座老式的教堂，有高高的天花板和光亮的硬木桌子，我们可以把课本摊开来安静地学习。在这里我们受到保护，就像裹着一层茧衣，各种需求都会得到满足。我后来才知道，很多学生从小到大一直都处在这样的环境中，不知道还有其他不同的生活。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Attached to all of this was a new vocabulary, one I needed to master. What was a precept? What was a reading period? Nobody had explained to me the meaning of "extra-long" bedsheets on the school packing list, which meant that I bought myself too-short bedsheets and would thus spend my freshman year sleeping with my feet resting on the exposed plastic of the dorm mattress. There was an especially distinct learning curve when it came to understanding sports. I'd been raised on the bedrock of football, basketball, and baseball, but it turned out that East Coast prep schoolers did more. Lacrosse was a thing. Field hockey was a thing. Squash, even, was a thing. For a kid from the South Side, it could be a little dizzying. "You row crew?" What does that even mean?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="与这些相伴而来的是一个新词汇表，是我需要学习的。什么是“导修课” [1]？什么是“复习日” [2]？没人跟我解释学校行李单列表上的“超长”床单是什么意思，导致我买的床单太短，整个大一期间，我睡觉时脚都放在裸露的塑料床垫上。在运动项目上，需要学习的就更多了。我从前只熟悉橄榄球、篮球和棒球，现在才发现东海岸预科学校毕业的学生接触过的运动项目要多得多。长曲棍球是一种，草地曲棍球是一种，壁球也是一种。对于一个来自芝加哥南城的孩子来说，这有点让人头晕。“你加入赛艇队了吗？”这句话到底是什么意思？【注：[1]导修课（The Precept System），指普林斯顿大学为学生提供的课外小组讨论活动。小组成员一般一周聚会一次，根据某门课程的指定话题或课外延伸阅读的内容进行小组讨论。[2]复习日（Reading Period），通常为美国大学提供给学生的十天左右的复习期，用于期末备考。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I had only one advantage, the same one I'd had when starting kindergarten: I was still Craig Robinson's little sister. Craig was now a junior and a top player on the varsity basketball team. He was, as he'd always been, a man with fans. Even the campus security guards greeted him by name. Craig had a life, and I managed at least partially to slip into it. I got to know his teammates and their friends. One night I went to a dinner with him off campus, at the well-appointed home of one of the basketball team's boosters, where sitting at the dining room table I was met by a confounding sight, a food item that like so many other things at Princeton required a lesson in gentility -- a spiny green artichoke laid out on a white china plate.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Third World Center -- or TWC, as most of us called it -- quickly became a kind of home base for me. It hosted parties and co-op meals. There were volunteer tutors to help with homework and spaces just to hang out. I'd made a handful of instant friends during the summer program, and many of us gravitated toward the center during our free time. Among them was Suzanne Alele. Suzanne was tall and thin with thick eyebrows and luxurious dark hair that fell in a shiny wave down her back. She had been born in Nigeria and raised in Kingston, Jamaica, though her family had moved to Maryland when she was a teenager. Perhaps as a result, she seemed unhooked from any single cultural identity. People were drawn to Suzanne. It was hard not to be. She had a wide-open smile and a slight island lilt in her voice that became more pronounced anytime she was tired or a little drunk. She carried herself with what I think of as a Caribbean breeziness, a lightness of spirit that caused her to stand out among Princeton's studious masses. She was unafraid to plunge into parties where she didn't know a soul. Even though she was premed, she made a point of taking pottery and dance classes for the simple reason that they made her happy.</div>

<div class="line_en">I imagine that the administrators at Princeton didn't love the fact that students of color largely stuck together. The hope was that all of us would mingle in heterogeneous harmony, deepening the quality of student life across the board. It's a worthy goal. I understand that when it comes to campus diversity, the ideal would be to achieve something resembling what's often shown on college brochures -- smiling students working and socializing in neat, ethnically blended groups. But even today, with white students continuing to outnumber students of color on college campuses, the burden of assimilation is put largely on the shoulders of minority students. In my experience, it's a lot to ask.</div>

<div class="line_en">Later, during our sophomore year, Suzanne would take another plunge, deciding to bicker at an eating club called Cap and Gown --"bicker" being a verb with a meaning particular to Princeton, signifying the social vetting that goes on when clubs choose new members. I loved the stories Suzanne brought back from the eating-club banquets and parties she went to, but I had no interest in bickering myself. I was happy with the community of black and Latino students I'd found through the TWC, content to remain at the margins of Princeton's larger social scene. Our group was small but tight. We threw parties and danced half the night. At meals, we often packed ten or more around a table, laid-back and laughing. Our dinners could stretch into hours, not unlike the long communal meals my family used to have around the table at Southside's house.</div>

You learn only slowly that your new peers had been given SAT tutoring or college-caliber teaching in high school or had gone to boarding school and thus weren't grappling with the difficulties of being away from home for the first time. It was like stepping onstage at your first piano recital and realizing that you'd never played anything but an instrument with broken keys. Your world shifts, but you're asked to adjust and overcome, to play your music the same as everyone else.</div>

Her mother also gave an interview, confirming the story and providing more context.

I helped out about ten hours a week when I wasn't in class, sitting at a desk alongside Loretta, the full-time secretary, typing memos, answering the phone, and directing students who came in with questions about dropping a class or signing up for the food co-op. The office sat in the front corner of the building, with sun-flooded windows and mismatched furniture that made it more homey than institutional.

For students of color at Princeton, she was like an über-mentor, our ultrahip and always outspoken defender in chief, and for this she was universally appreciated. In the office, she juggled multiple projects -- lobbying the university administration to enact more inclusive policies for minorities, advocating for individual students and their needs, and spinning out new ideas for how all of us could improve our lot. She was often running late, blasting out the center's front door at a full sprint, clutching a sheaf of loose papers with a lit cigarette in her mouth and a purse draped over her shoulder, shouting directives to me and Loretta as she went.

<div class="line_en">The answer was again no, but Czerny soon rectified that. One Saturday morning, we piled into her car -- me and young Jonathan and another friend who also worked at the TWC -- and rode along as Czerny drove full speed toward Manhattan, talking and smoking all the way. You could almost feel something lifting off her as we drove, an unspooling of tension as the white-fenced horse farms surrounding Princeton gave way to choked highways and finally the spires of the city rising in front of us.

I don't remember exactly what we did that day: I know we had pizza. We saw Rockefeller Center, drove through Central Park, and caught sight of the Statue of Liberty with her hopeful hoisted torch. But we were mainly there for practical reasons. Czerny seemed to be recharging her soul by running through a list of mundane errands. She had things to pick up, things to drop off. She double-parked on busy cross streets as she dashed in and out of buildings, provoking an avalanche of honking ire from other drivers, while the rest of us sat helplessly in the car.

It wasn't pretty, but I found it encouraging in the end, proof that I could work my way out of just about any hole.

I tried not to feel intimidated when classroom conversation was dominated by male students, which it often was. Hearing them, I realized that they weren't at all smarter than the rest of us.

<div class="line_en">Slowly, though, I began to understand that there were many versions of quotas being filled at the school. As minorities, we were the most visible, but it became clear that special dispensations were made to admit all kinds of students whose grades or accomplishments might not measure up to the acknowledged standard. It was hardly a straight meritocracy. There were the athletes, for example. There were the legacy kids, whose fathers and grandfathers had been Tigers or whose families had funded the building of a dorm or a library. I also learned that being rich didn't protect you from failure. Around me, I saw students flaming out -- white, black, privileged or not. Some were seduced by weeknight keg parties, some were crushed by the stress of trying to live up to some scholarly ideal, and others were just plain lazy or so out of their element they needed to flee. My job, as I saw it, was to hold steady, earn the best grades I could, and get myself through.</div>

Another girl we knew had six friends over to her dorm room one night to celebrate her birthday and promptly got hauled into the dean's office, informed that her white roommate evidently hadn't felt comfortable with having "big black guys" in the room. There were so few of us minority kids at Princeton, I suppose, that our presence was always conspicuous. I mainly took this as a mandate to overperform, to do everything I possibly could to keep up with or even plow past the more privileged people around me. Just as it had been at Whitney Young, my intensity was spawned at least in part by a feeling of I'll show you.

Suzanne had felt some pressure from her parents to pursue medicine though eventually gave up on it, finding that it messed with her joy. At some point, she was put on academic probation, but even that didn't seem to bother her much. She was the Laverne to my Shirley, the Ernie to my Bert.

<div class="line_cn" title="我慢慢发现，苏珊娜不是一个深思熟虑的人。我给她起外号叫“苏傻娜”，因为她每天过得不切实际，随心所欲。她做大多数决定，比如跟谁约会、上什么课，都是基于那件事好不好玩。如果事情不好玩，她会很快改变方向。当我加入黑人联合组织，几乎每天泡在第三世界中心时，她跑去参加田径赛，还加入了轻量级橄榄球队，因为这样可以近距离接触那些体格健壮的帅哥。她通过饮食俱乐部交到了一些有钱的白人朋友，其中有一个少年成名的真正的电影明星，还有一位来自欧洲的据传是某国公主的学生。苏珊娜迫于父母的压力，选择了读医学预科，但最终她放弃了，因为不喜欢。她一度还因挂科收到留校察看的通知，但她似乎并不太在意。她是“拉维恩”，我是“雪莉” [8]；她是“厄尼”，我是“伯特” [9]。我们的宿舍就像一个两种思想观念交锋的战场，苏珊娜那边到处是乱扔的衣服和散落的纸张，而我这边的东西则收拾得井井有条。【注：[8]拉维恩和雪莉是情景喜剧《拉维恩和雪莉》（Laverne &amp; Shirley）中的两个人物。这部剧于1976年至1983年间在美国ABC电视台播出，讲述了两个住在同一宿舍的女人的故事。[9]厄尼和伯特，美国1969年首播的儿童教育电视节目《芝麻街》里的两个主要人物。厄尼是个乐天派，为人轻佻，喜欢捉弄伯特，但他能说会道，搞得伯特毫无办法。伯特长期痛苦地忍受着厄尼的取笑，他对人认真，任何事都可以令他沉迷，他最喜欢收集瓶盖和回形针，还喜欢管弦乐和他的宠物鸽子。他总是能原谅厄尼，而且永远做他的好朋友。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I sometimes had to block out Suzanne's chaos so I could think straight. I sometimes wanted to yell at her, but I never did. Suzanne was who she was. She wasn't going to change. When it got to be too much, I'd scoop up her junk and pile it on her bed without comment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我有时必须要屏蔽苏珊娜留下的一片狼藉才能静下心来思考。我有时想要冲她吼叫，但我没那么做。苏珊娜就是这样一个人，她不会改变。如果我实在忍不下去，就会把她的那堆“垃圾”抱起来放在她床上，什么话也不多说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You really gotta do that?" I'd say, watching Suzanne arrive back from track practice and head to the shower, stripping off her sweaty workout outfit and dropping it on the floor where it would live, intermingled with clean clothes and unfinished school assignments, for the next week.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="每次苏珊娜参加田径训练回来，脱下被汗水浸透的运动服扔在地板上，直接跑去淋浴时，我就会说：“你确定要这么做吗？”因为她那身脏衣服会跟干净衣服还有没做完的作业混在一起，一直到下一周。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Do what?" she'd say back, flashing her wholesome smile.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“做什么？”她会问，脸上带着健康阳光的笑容。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I see now that she provoked me in a good way, introducing me to the idea that not everyone needs to have their file folders labeled and alphabetized, or even to have files at all. Years later, I'd fall in love with a guy who, like Suzanne, stored his belongings in heaps and felt no compunction, really ever, to fold his clothes. But I was able to coexist with it, thanks to Suzanne. I am still coexisting with that guy to this day. This is what a control freak learns inside the compressed otherworld of college, maybe above all else: There are simply other ways of being.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在我认识到，她当时那样激怒我，对我来说是有益处的，即让我意识到并非每个人都会给文件夹贴标签和按字母排序，有些人压根儿就没有文件。多年后，我会爱上一个男人，他和苏珊娜一样，把自己的东西堆成一堆，从不觉得有叠衣服的必要。但是我能够接受这些，这要感谢苏珊娜。直到今天，我还和这个男人生活在一起。这是一个控制狂在大学这个小社会的生活中学到的一点，可能也是最为重要的一点，那就是，世界上还有其他的生活方式。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Have you ever," Czerny said to me one day, "thought about starting a little after-school program for kids?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一天，泽妮问我：“你有没有想过办一个校外托管小班？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She was asking out of compassion, I would guess. Over time, I'd grown so dedicated to Jonathan, who was now in elementary school, that a good number of my afternoons were spent wandering around Princeton with him as my sidekick, or at the Third World Center, the two of us playing duets on its poorly tuned piano or reading on a saggy couch. Czerny paid me for my time but seemed to think it wasn't enough.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我猜，她这么问是出于补偿心理。因为经过一段时间的相处，我和乔纳森的关系越来越亲密。他正在上小学，很多个下午，我都带着他在普林斯顿校园里闲逛或者在第三世界中心玩儿。我们在那里的一架音调不准的钢琴上弹二重奏，或者在一个凹陷的沙发上读书。泽妮按时间给我付酬，但她似乎觉得这些还不够。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm serious," she said. "I know plenty of faculty members who're always looking for after-school care. You could run it out of the center. Just try it and see how it goes."</div>

<div class="line_en">With Czerny's word-of-mouth advertising, it wasn't long before I had a gaggle of three or four children to look after. These were the kids of black administrators and professors at Princeton, who themselves were a profound minority and like the rest of us tended to gravitate toward the TWC. Several afternoons a week, after public elementary school let out, I fed them healthy snacks and ran around with them on the lawn. If they had homework, we worked on it together.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有泽妮帮我做口头宣传，很快我就招到了三四个孩子。这些都是普林斯顿的黑人管理人员和教授的孩子，他们自己也是少数派，和我一样，他们也经常到TWC来活动。一周有几天下午，在公立小学放学后，我会给他们吃一些健康的食物，带他们在草坪上玩。如果他们有作业，我们就一起做。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For me, the hours flew. Being around children had a wonderful obliterative effect, wiping out school stress, forcing me out of my head and into the moment. As a girl, I'd passed whole days playing "mommy" to my dolls, pretending that I knew how to dress and feed them, brushing their hair, and tenderly putting Band-Aids on their plastic knees. Now I was doing it for real, finding the whole undertaking a lot messier but no less gratifying than what I'd imagined. I'd go back to my dorm after a few hours with the kids, drained but happy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我感觉时间过得飞快。和孩子们在一起会产生一些意想不到的效果，比如可以消除学业压力，强迫我停止动脑，关注当下。小时候，我天天玩布娃娃，给她们当“妈咪”，假装懂得怎么给她们穿衣喂饭，还给她们梳头发，在她们的塑料膝盖上贴上创可贴。现在我是真的在做这些事，这比小时候的游戏要复杂得多，但是跟我之前想象的一样令人满足。和孩子们玩儿几个小时后，我会回到宿舍，虽然精疲力竭，但是心情愉快。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Once a week or so, if I found a quiet moment, I'd pick up the phone and dial the number for our apartment on Euclid. If my father was working early shifts, I could catch him in the late afternoon, sitting -- or so I imagined -- with his legs up in his reclining chair in our living room, watching TV, and waiting for my mom to get home from work. In the evenings, it was usually my mother who picked up the phone. I narrated my college life in exacting detail to both my parents like a homesteader dutifully providing dispatches from the frontier. I spilled every observation I had -- from how I didn't like my French professor to the antics of the little kids in my after-school program to the fact that Suzanne and I had a dedicated, mutual crush on an African American engineering student with transfixing green eyes who, even though we doggedly shadowed his every move, seemed to barely know we were alive.</div>

<div class="line_en">When I was done talking, he ran through the news from home. Dandy and Grandma had moved back to Dandy's hometown of Georgetown, South Carolina, and Grandma, he reported, was finding herself a bit lonely. He described how my mother was working overtime trying to care for Robbie, who was now in her seventies, widowed, and struggling with an array of health issues. He never mentioned his own struggles, but I knew they were there. At one point when Craig had a home basketball game on a Saturday, my parents drove all the way to Princeton to see it, and I got my first look at their shifting reality -- at what never got said on the phone. After pulling into the vast parking lot outside Jadwin Gym, my father reluctantly slid into a wheelchair and allowed my mother to push him inside.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我说完后，父亲会告诉我家里的一些消息。祖父和祖母搬回了祖父的家乡—南卡罗来纳州的乔治敦港，祖母在那儿有点孤单。母亲下班后还需要照顾萝比。萝比那时七十多岁了，特里已经去世，她的身体有不少问题。父亲从来不提自己的身体，但我知道他的病情在加重。有一次，克雷格星期六在球场上打篮球赛，父母从家里开车到普林斯顿来观看比赛，我第一次看到了他们的现状—在电话里他们对此从来只字不提。车停在扎德温体育馆外宽敞的停车场上，父亲不情愿地挪进轮椅中，让母亲把他推了进去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I almost didn't want to see what was happening to my father. I couldn't bear it. I'd done some research on multiple sclerosis in the Princeton library, photocopying medical journal articles to send to my parents. I'd tried to insist that they call a specialist or sign Dad up for some physical therapy, but they -- my dad, primarily -- didn't want to hear any of it. For all the hours we spent talking on the phone while I was at college, his health was the one topic he wouldn't touch.</div>
