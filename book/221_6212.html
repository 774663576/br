<div class="line_en">Everything that is sensible, or smart, Katrina did first, despite being eighteen months younger than me. Every book I ever read she had read first, every fact I mentioned at the dinner table she already knew. She is the only person I know who actually likes exams. Sometimes I think I dress the way I do because the one thing Treena can't do is put clothes together. She's a pullover and jeans kind of a girl. Her idea of smart is ironing the jeans first.</div>

<div class="line_en">I am not thick. I'd just like to get that out of the way at this point. But it's quite hard not to feel a bit deficient in the Department of Brain Cells, growing up next to a younger sister who was not just moved up a year into my class, but then to the year above.</div>

<div class="line_en">My father calls me a "character", because I tend to say the first thing that pops into my head. He says I'm like my Aunt Lily, who I never knew. It's a bit weird, constantly being compared to someone you've never met. I would come downstairs in purple boots, and Dad would nod at Mum and say, "D"you remember Aunt Lily and her purple boots, eh?" and Mum would cluck and start laughing as if at some secret joke. My mother calls me "individual", which is her polite way of not quite understanding the way I dress.</div>

<div class="line_en">But apart from a brief period in my teens, I never wanted to look like Treena, or any of the girls at school; I preferred boys' clothes till I was about fourteen, and now tend to please myself -- depending on what mood I am in on the day. There's no point me trying to look conventional. I am small, dark-haired and, according to my dad, have the face of an elf. That's not as in "elfin beauty". I am not plain, but I don't think anyone is ever going to call me beautiful. I don't have that graceful thing going on. Patrick calls me gorgeous when he wants to get his leg over, but he's fairly transparent like that. We've known each other for coming up to seven years.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="除了青少年时的一段短暂时间，我从没想要看起来像特丽娜，或是学校里的任何女孩。直到我十四岁左右，我都更喜欢穿男孩的衣服，现在我倾向于取悦我自己——依据当天的心情穿衣打扮。穿得跟别人一样让我觉得没有意义。我个子小、头发乌黑，照父亲的说法，长着一张小精灵的脸。那不并是指我如“精灵般的美丽”。我并不丑，但我认为没有人会说我漂亮，我身上没有那种优雅的气质。帕特里克想跟我亲热时会夸我漂亮极了，那显然只是随口说说而已。我们认识七年了，彼此知根知底。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I was twenty-six years old and I wasn't really sure what I was. Up until I lost my job I hadn't even given it any thought. I supposed I would probably marry Patrick, knock out a few kids, live a few streets away from where I had always lived. Apart from an exotic taste in clothes, and the fact that I'm a bit short, there's not a lot separating me from anyone you might pass in the street. You probably wouldn't look at me twice. An ordinary girl, leading an ordinary life. It actually suited me fine.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我二十六岁了，还是搞不太清楚自己是什么样的人。丢掉工作以前，我压根儿没想过这个问题。我觉得我十有八九会跟帕特里克结婚，生几个孩子，住在离我家只隔几条街的地方。我与你在街上遇到的人没什么两样，除了喜欢奇装异服，个子有点矮以外。你很可能不会多看我一眼。一个普普通通的女孩，过着平平淡淡的日子。这句话形容我再贴切不过。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Granta House was on the other side of Stortfold Castle, close to the medieval walls, on the long unpavemented stretch that comprised only four houses and the National Trust shop, bang in the middle of the tourist area. I had passed this house a million times in my life without ever actually properly seeing it. Now, walking past the car park and the miniature railway, both of which were empty and as bleak as only a summer attraction can look in February, I saw it was bigger than I had imagined, red brick with a double front, the kind of house you saw in old copies of Country Life while waiting at the doctor't</div>

<div class="line_en">I followed her through to a huge room with floor to ceiling French windows. Heavy curtains draped elegantly from fat mahogany curtain poles, and the floors were carpeted with intricately decorated Persian rugs. It smelt of beeswax and antique furniture.

<div class="line_en">While she flicked through her folder of papers, I gazed surreptitiously around the room. I had thought the house might be a bit like a care home, all hoists and wipe-clean surfaces. But this was like one of those scarily expensive hotels, steeped in old money, with well-loved things that looked valuable in their own right. There were silver-framed photographs on a sideboard, but they were too far away for me to make out the faces. As she scanned her pages, I shifted in my seat, to try to get a better look.</div>

<div class="line_en">"She has the gift of the flab." Dad snorted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“她有讲废话的天赋。”父亲哼了一声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was a general murmur of agreement around the table.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, it comes to something when the best you can all say about my new career is that it's better than hauling chicken carcasses around the inside of an aircraft hangar," I said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这么说，我这份新工作最大的优点就是比在工厂里运送死鸡强。”我说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Get fit. Thanks, Dad." I had been about to reach for another potato, and now changed my mind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“健身？谢谢你，爸爸。”我本想再舀一个土豆，这会儿又改变了主意。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, you could always get fit in the meantime and go and do some of your personal training stuff with Patrick here."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好啦，同时你也可以健健身啊，跟帕特里克一起做做私人培训。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我刚刚找了份工作，”我说，“薪水也比上一份工作多，您别见怪。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, why not?" Mum looked as if she might actually sit down -- everyone paused briefly, but no, she was up again, helping Granddad to some gravy. "It might be worth bearing in mind for the future. You've certainly got the gift of the gab."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是啊，为什么不呢？”母亲看起来像是马上要坐下来——每个人都突然停了下来——但是没有，她又站起身来，给外祖父盛了点肉汁。“你要为将来打算打算。毫无疑问，你有闲聊的天赋。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But it is only temporary," Patrick interjected. "Your Dad's right. You might want to start getting in shape while you do it. You could be a good personal trainer, if you put in a bit of effort."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可这只是临时的，”帕特里克插话道，“你爸爸是对的。做这份工作的时候你可以开始锻炼，让自己更有型。如果稍微用点功，你会成为一个好的私人教练。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"What Lou wants is a job where she can put her feet up and watch daytime telly while feeding old Ironside there through a straw," said Treena.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“露想要的是这样一份工作，能让她跷起腿，看白天的电视节目，并且通过一根麦管给那些老骨头喂食物。”特丽娜说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I don't want to be a personal trainer. I don't fancy… all that… bouncing." I mouthed an insult at Patrick, who grinned.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不想做私人教练。我不喜欢……蹦蹦跳跳。”我向帕特里克做了个受到侮辱的怪相，他咧嘴而笑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes. Because rearranging limp dahlias into buckets of water requires so much physical and mental effort, doesn't it, Treen?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的。因为把柔软的大丽菊移植到水桶里需要付出太多心力与体力，难道不是吗，特丽娜？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我们逗你玩儿呢，亲爱的。”父亲举起茶杯，“你找到工作这很好。我们很为你感到骄傲。我敢断定，一旦你在那栋大房子里操劳起来，那群浑蛋就再也离不开你。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Not me," said Dad, chewing, before Mum could say a thing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不是我说的。”父亲说。在母亲开口之前，他拼命嚼着食物。">查看中文翻译</div>
