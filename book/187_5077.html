<div class="line_en">The bonfire had gone out. On the earth all was blackness: in fact you could not have told that you were looking into a wood if you had not seen where the dark shapes of the trees ended and the stars began. But when Aslan had roared yet again, out on their left they saw another black shape. That is, they saw another patch where there were no stars: and the patch rose up higher and higher and became the shape of a man, the hugest of all giants. They all knew Narnia well enough to work out where he must be standing. He must be on the high moorlands that stretch away to the North beyond the River Shribble. Then Jill and Eustace remembered how once long ago, in the deep caves beneath those moors, they had seen a great giant asleep and been told that his name was Father Time, and that he would wake on the day the world ended.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then the great giant raised a horn to his mouth. They could see this by the change of the black shape he made against the stars. After that -- quite a bit later, because sound travels so slowly -- they heard the sound of the horn: high and terrible, yet of a strange, deadly beauty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时这了不得的巨人把一个号角举到嘴边。他们看得见这个动作，是凭着他那映衬着星光的黑影儿的变化。这之后——好一会儿之后，因为声音传得十分缓慢——他们听到了号角的声音：高亢激越，骇人听闻，然而又有一种新奇的阴森森的美。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And then the starless patch began to grow, spreading further and further out from the centre of the sky. And presently a quarter of the whole sky was black, and then a half, and at last the rain of shooting stars was going on only low down near the horizon.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是那无星的黑块便开始变大，从天空的中央向外铺陈开去。不久，四分之一的天空全然变黑了，然后是一半儿天空变黑了，最后，流星之雨只是在低得靠近地平线的地方倾泻而下了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Immediately the sky became full of shooting stars. Even one shooting star is a fine thing to see; but these were dozens, and then scores, and then hundreds, till it was like silver rain: and it went on and on. And when it had gone on for some while, one or two of them began to think that there was another dark shape against the sky as well as the giant's. It was in a different place, right overhead, up in the very roof of the sky as you might call it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="天空突然之间遍布了流星。即使一颗流星也是很好看的景致：但现在是十几颗、二十几颗乃至成百颗流星，终于像是银白色的雨，一阵又一阵地下着。星雨下了一些时候，他们之中有一两个人开始认为又有一个黑影儿像巨人的黑影一样映衬在天空里。它位于一个截然不同的地方，正在人们的头顶之上，正在你可能称之为“天空屋顶”的地方。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">With a thrill of wonder (and there was some terror in it too) they all suddenly realized what was happening. The spreading blackness was not a cloud at all: it was simply emptiness. The black part of the sky was the part in which there were no stars left. All the stars were falling: Aslan had called them home.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="满怀神奇之感（也有些儿毛骨悚然之感），他们突然认识到正在发生什么事情了。铺陈开来的黑暗压根儿不是云霾：它简直就是空虚。天空中的黑暗部分就是一颗星也没剩下的部分。所有的繁星都在落下来：阿斯兰已经呼唤它们回家去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Stars began falling all round them. But stars in that world are not the great flaming globes they are in ours. They are people (Edmund and Lucy had once met one). So now they found showers of glittering people, all with long hair like burning silver and spears like white-hot metal, rushing down to them out of the black air, swifter than falling stones. They made a hissing noise as they landed and burnt the grass. And all these stars glided past them and stood somewhere behind, a little to the right.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="流星开始在他们的四周纷纷落下。那个世界里的流星，并不像我们的世界里的流星那样是巨大的燃烧着的星球。它们是人（爱德蒙和露茜曾经碰到过一个）。所以，他们现在发觉闪烁生光的人像阵雨似的倾泻而下，人人都生着长长的头发像燃烧的银丝，拿着长矛像烫得白热化的金属，从黑暗的空中朝着他们奔腾而下；速度之快，超过了天上落下来的石子。他们发出嘶嘶的声音，落到地上，把青草也燃着了。这些流星人全都在他们身边掠过，站在后边儿的某些地方，稍稍靠近右边一点儿。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This was a great advantage, because otherwise, now that there were no stars in the sky, everything would have been completely dark and you could have seen nothing. As it was, the crowd of stars behind them cast a fierce, white light over their shoulders. They could see mile upon mile of Narnian woods spread out before them, looking as if they were floodlit. Every bush and almost every blade of grass had its black shadow behind it. The edge of every leaf stood out so sharp that you'd think you could cut your finger on it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这对他们大为有利，因为，不然的话，如果今天空中暗无星辰，一切东西都会全然漆黑，你就什么东西都看不见了。事实上，他们背后的一群繁星把强烈的白色光芒越过他们的肩膀向前照射。他们能看见纳尼亚树林一英里又一英里地在他们的前边儿绵延开去，看上去树林里都泛滥着强光。每一丛灌木，几乎每一片草叶，背后几乎都有它的黑色阴影。每一片叶子的边缘都轮廓分明地挺立着，使你感到你会在叶子边缘上划破手指的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The light from behind them (and a little to their right) was so strong that it lit up even the slopes of the Northern Moors. Something was moving there. Enormous animals were crawling and sliding down into Narnia: great dragons and giant lizards and featherless birds with wings like bats' wings. They disappeared into the woods and for a few minutes there was silence. Then there came -- at first from very far off -- sounds of wailing and then, from every direction, a rustling and a pattering and a sound of wings. It came nearer and nearer. Soon one could distinguish the scamper of little feet from the padding of big paws, and the clack-clack of light little hoofs from the thunder of great ones. And then one could see thousands of pairs of eyes gleaming. And at last, out of the shadow of the trees, racing up the hill for dear life, by thousands and by millions, came all kinds of creatures -- Talking Beasts, Dwarfs, Satyrs, Fauns, Giants, Calormenes, men from Archenland, Monopods, and strange unearthly things from the remote islands of the unknown Western lands. And all these ran up to the doorway where Aslan stood.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从他们背后（稍为偏右一点儿）照射过来的光芒是那么强烈，甚至把北方高沼地的土坡也照亮了。有些东西在那儿走动。巨大的野兽正在爬行着悄悄地下坡，进入纳尼亚：庞大的龙，巨型的蜥蜴，浑身无羽毛、生着蝙蝠式翅膀的鸟儿。它们消失在树林里，几分钟后便寂静无声了。接着，传来了——起初是从很远的地方——号啕痛哭的声音，随即又从四面八方传来了沙沙瑟瑟声，啪哒啪哒声和振翅鼓翼声。声音愈来俞近。不久便能分辨出，大脚的跳跳蹦蹦和大脚爪的啪哒啪哒，小而轻的蹄子的嘚嘚声和大而重的蹄子的隆隆声。接下来就看得见成千双眼睛在闪光了。最后，从树木的阴影里蹿出来成千上万、各种各类的野兽，为了保住宝贵的性命，纷纷争先恐后地跑上山去——会说人话的兽类、小矮人、森林之神、半人半羊的农牧神、巨人、卡乐门人、阿钦兰人、马诺帕德人，以及来自遥远的岛屿和陌生的西方陆地的奇异的神怪之物。所有这些人、兽、怪物，都朝着阿斯兰所站立的那个门口跑去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The creatures came rushing on, their eyes brighter and brighter as they drew nearer and nearer to the standing Stars. But as they came right up to Aslan one or other of two things happened to each of them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="芸芸众生涌过来了，他们愈走愈靠近站在地上的繁星，他们的眼睛便愈来愈明亮。但，当他们走到阿斯兰跟前时，每个人都会在两桩事情中碰到一桩，不是这样，便是那样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This part of the adventure was the only one which seemed rather like a dream at the time and rather hard to remember properly afterwards. Especially, one couldn't say how long it had taken. Sometimes it seemed to have lasted only a few minutes, but at others it felt as if it might have gone on for years. Obviously, unless either the Door had grown very much larger or the creatures had suddenly grown as small as gnats, a crowd like that couldn't ever have tried to get through it. But no one thought about that sort of thing at the time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这一部分惊险经历是绝无仅有的，当时仿佛很像是个梦，事后也很难记忆得恰当正确。特别是，没法儿说清楚这种情况持续了多久。有时候，仿佛只经历了几分钟；但，有时候却又觉得仿佛经历了好几年。事情十分明显：除非那门变得极大极大，或者那些动物突然变得小如小虫，那么一大群的动物是没法儿试图穿过那个门的。但当时谁也没有思考过诸如此类的问题。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They all looked straight in his face, I don't think they had any choice about that. And when some looked, the expression of their faces changed terribly -- it was fear and hatred: except that, on the faces of Talking Bears, the fear and hatred lasted only for a fraction of a second. You could see that they suddenly ceased to the Talking Beasts. They were just ordinary animals. And all the creatures who looked at Aslan in that way swerved to their right, his left, and disappeared into his huge black shadow, which (as you have heard) streamed away to the left of the doorway. The children never saw them again. I don't know what became of them. But the others looked in the face of Aslan and loved him, though some of them were very frightened at the same time. And all these came in at the Door, in on Aslan's right. There were some queer specimens among them. Eustace even recognized one of those very Dwarfs who had helped to shoot the Horses. But he had no time to wonder about that sort of thing (and anyway it was no business of his) for a great joy put everything else out of his head. Among the happy creatures who now came crowding round Tirian and his friends were all those whom they had thought dead. There was Roonwit the Centaur and Jewel the Unicorn and the good Boar and the good Bear, and Farsight the Eagle, and the dear Dogs and the Horses, and Poggin the Dwarf.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们大家都笔直地瞧着阿斯兰的脸；我想他们必须如此，没有选择的余地。有的瞧着阿斯兰时，脸色可怕地变了——这是由于害怕和憎恨；会说人话的野兽倒是例外，害怕和憎恨的脸色出现了一秒钟还不到。你能看见它们突然变成不会说人话的野兽了。它们就成了普普通通的动物。所有的动物，凡是这样瞧着阿斯兰的，都突然转向右面，也就是到了阿斯兰的左边，在阿斯兰巨大的黑影里销声匿迹了（正如你所听说的），这黑影儿是向门口左边儿泻开去的。孩子们这就再也见不到它们了。我不知道它们变成了什么。但，其他的动物目不转睛地瞧着阿斯兰，心里也爱着阿斯兰，尽管有几个同时心里也非常害怕。所有这些动物，进到门里，站在阿斯兰的右边。其中也有些古怪的家伙。尤斯塔斯甚至认出了一个小矮人，他当初就是帮着敌人用箭射杀马儿的小矮人之一。但他也没有时间去为这种事情纳罕（无论如何，那也不是他的事情），因为另有一大喜事使他把其他一切事情都丢在脑后了。现在走过来拥挤在蒂莲和他的朋友们周围的快乐的人们之中，都是那些早已被认为死去的战友：有人头马龙威特和独角兽珍宝、善良的野猪和善良的熊和千里眼老鹰，亲爱的狗儿和马儿、小矮人波金等。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Dragons and Giant Lizards now had Narnia to themselves. They went to and fro tearing up the trees by the roots and crunching them up as if they were sticks of rhubarb. Minute by minute the forests disappeared. The whole country became bare and you could see all sorts of things about its shape -- all the little humps and hollows which you had never noticed before. The grass died. Soon Tirian found that he was looking at a world of bare rock and earth. You could hardly believe that anything had ever lived there. The monsters themselves grew old and lay down and died. Their flesh shrivelled up and the bones appeared: soon they were only huge skeletons that lay here and there on the dead rock, looking as if they had died thousands of years ago. For a long time everything was still.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="龙和巨型蜥蜴现在把纳尼亚当做它们的天下了。它们跑来跑去，把树木连根拔起，把树木嘎吱嘎吱地大嚼大吃，仿佛它们是大葱似的。顷刻之间，树林都消失了。整个儿乡村变得光秃秃的，你可以看得见各种各样的东西的形状——看得见一切你以前从未注意过的小丘和小洞。青草死了。蒂莲不久便发觉他正在瞧着一个光秃秃的石头和泥土的世界了。简直很难相信曾经有什么东西在这地方生存过的。怪物们自己也老了，躺下了，死了。他们的肉皱缩枯槁了，骨头露出来了，不久他们就只剩下巨大的骷髅，东一个西一个地躺在没有生命的石头上，看上去仿佛已经死了好几千年了。好久好久，万籁俱寂。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Further in and higher up!" cried Roonwit and thundered away in a gallop to the West. And though they did not understand him, the words somehow set them tingling all over. The Boar grunted at them cheerfully. The Bear was just going to mutter that he still didn't understand, when he caught sight of the fruit-trees behind them. He waddled to those trees as fast as he could and there, no doubt, found something he understood very well. But the Dogs remained, wagging their tails, and Poggin remained, shaking hands with everyone and grinning all over his honest face. And Jewel leaned his snowy white head over the King's shoulder and the King whispered in Jewel's ear. Then everyone turned his attention again to what could be seen through the Doorway.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“更深入更高！”龙威特大声呐喊，蹄声隆隆地向西边驰去了。虽然他们不了解它，但它这话却不知怎么的使他们浑身激动。野猪高高兴兴地向他们咕咕哝哝地说话。熊正要唠叨它仍旧搞不明白时，看到了他们背后的果树。它赶快摇摇晃晃地走到那些果树跟前，毫无疑问，它找到了它十分懂得的食物。但狗儿们摇着尾巴留下来了；波金也留下了，跟大家握手，诚实的脸上满面都是笑容。独角兽珍宝把它白发苍苍的脑袋靠在国王的肩膀上，国王在珍宝的耳朵边低声说话。接着，大家把注意力重新集中在从门口可以望得见的情况上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A widespread noise broke the silence: first a murmur then a rumble, then a roar. And now they could see what it was that was coming, and how fast it came. It was a foaming wall of water. The sea was rising. In that tree-less world you could see it very well. You could see all the rivers getting wider and the lakes getting larger, and separate lakes joining into one, and valleys turning into new lakes, and hills turning into islands, and then those islands vanishing. And the high moors to their left and the higher mountains to their right crumbled and slipped down with a roar and a splash into the mounting water; and the water came swirling up to the very threshold of the Doorway (but never passed it) so that the foam splashed about Aslan's forefeet. All now was level water from where they stood to where the waters met the sky.</div>

A streak of dreary and disastrous dawn spread along the horizon, and widened and grew brighter, till in the end they hardly noticed the light of the stars who stood behind them. At last the sun came up. When it did, the Lord Digory and the Lady Polly looked at one another and gave a little nod: those two, in a different world, had once seen a dying sun, and so they knew at once that this sun also was dying. It was three times -- twenty times -- as big as it ought to be, and very dark red.

And perhaps he did draw her. At any rate she came to him, slowly at first, but then more and more quickly, till at last his long flames licked round her and the two ran together and became one huge ball like a burning coal.

<div class="line_en">The Dogs were still with them. They joined in the conversation but not much because they were too busy racing on ahead and racing back and rushing off to sniff at smells in the grass till they made themselves sneeze. Suddenly they picked up a scent which seemed to excite them very much. They all started arguing about it -- "Yes it is -- No it isn't -- That's just what I said -- anyone can smell what that is -- Take your great nose out of the way and let someone else smell."</div>
