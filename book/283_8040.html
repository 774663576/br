<div class="line_en">Some change of countenance was necessary for each gentleman as they walked into Mrs. Weston's drawing-room; -- Mr. Elton must compose his joyous looks, and Mr. John Knightley disperse his ill-humour. Mr. Elton must smile less, and Mr. John Knightley more, to fit them for the place. -- Emma only might be as nature prompted, and shew herself just as happy as she was. To her it was real enjoyment to be with the Westons. Mr. Weston was a great favourite, and there was not a creature in the world to whom she spoke with such unreserve, as to his wife; not any one, to whom she related with such conviction of being listened to and understood, of being always interesting and always intelligible, the little affairs, arrangements, perplexities, and pleasures of her father and herself. She could tell nothing of Hartfield, in which Mrs. Weston had not a lively concern; and half an hour's uninterrupted communication of all those little matters on which the daily happiness of private life depends, was one of the first gratifications of each.</div>

<div class="line_en">Emma's project of forgetting Mr. Elton for a while made her rather sorry to find, when they had all taken their places, that he was close to her. The difficulty was great of driving his strange insensibility towards Harriet, from her mind, while he not only sat at her elbow, but was continually obtruding his happy countenance on her notice, and solicitously addressing her upon every occasion. Instead of forgetting him, his behaviour was such that she could not avoid the internal suggestion of `Can it really be as my brother imagined? can it be possible for this man to be beginning to transfer his affections from Harriet to me? -- Absurd and insufferable!' -- Yet he would be so anxious for her being perfectly warm, would be so interested about her father, and so delighted with Mrs. Weston; and at last would begin admiring her drawings with so much zeal and so little knowledge as seemed terribly like a would-be lover, and made it some effort with her to preserve her good manners. For her own sake she could not be rude; and for Harriet's, in the hope that all would yet turn out right, she was even positively civil; but it was an effort; especially as something was going on amongst the others, in the most overpowering period of Mr. Elton's nonsense, which she particularly wished to listen to. She heard enough to know that Mr. Weston was giving some information about his son; she heard the words `my son,' and `Frank,' and `my son,' repeated several times over; and, from a few other half-syllables very much suspected that he was announcing an early visit from his son; but before she could quiet Mr. Elton, the subject was so completely past that any reviving question from her would have been awkward.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱玛原先打算暂时忘掉埃尔顿先生，可等大家坐下后，却见他就坐在她身边，心里不禁凉了半截。这个对哈丽特无情无义的怪人，要忘掉他还真不容易，他不仅坐在她旁边，而且总是喜眉笑脸地冲着她，急巴巴地抓住一切时机跟她讲话。他的这番举动，不仅没有让爱玛忘掉他，而且还难免让她心里犯疑：“难道真让姐夫猜中了？难道说这家伙变了心，不爱哈丽特倒爱起我来了？真是荒谬绝伦！”然而他十分关心爱玛是否穿得暖和，对她父亲兴致盎然，对韦斯顿太太喜幸不已。后来又夸奖起她的画来，一边赞叹不已，一边又显露出他的浅薄，俨然像个痴情种子，惹得爱玛差一点失礼。看在她自己的分上，她不能失礼；看在哈丽特的分上，她希望事情还有挽回的余地，便装做客客气气的。不过，这又谈何容易。就在埃尔顿先生胡搅蛮缠搞得她无可奈何时，别人扯起了一个话题，她特别想听一听。她听得出来，韦斯顿先生在说他的儿子。她听见他一次次地提到“我儿子”、“弗兰克”，而从另外一些半半拉拉的字眼中，她料想他在说他儿子很快就要来。然而，她还没来得及打断埃尔顿先生的话，韦斯顿先生早已谈完了那个话题，她也不便旧话重提了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The misfortune of Harriet's cold had been pretty well gone through before her arrival. Mr. Woodhouse had been safely seated long enough to give the history of it, besides all the history of his own and Isabella's coming, and of Emma's being to follow, and had indeed just got to the end of his satisfaction that James should come and see his daughter, when the others appeared, and Mrs. Weston, who had been almost wholly engrossed by her attentions to him, was able to turn away and welcome her dear Emma.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱玛还没到，哈丽特不幸感冒的消息就谈论开了。伍德豪斯先生早已平安到达，在主人家坐了多时，先讲述了他和伊莎贝拉一路上的情形，说爱玛随后就到，接着叙说了哈丽特生病的原委，最后又谈起詹姆斯该来看看女儿。刚说到这里，另外几个人赶到了。韦斯顿太太本来只能听他絮叨，现在一见来了机会，便连忙转身去迎接亲爱的爱玛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This was a pleasure which perhaps the whole day's visit might not afford, which certainly did not belong to the present half-hour; but the very sight of Mrs. Weston, her smile, her touch, her voice was grateful to Emma, and she determined to think as little as possible of Mr. Elton's oddities, or of any thing else unpleasant, and enjoy all that was enjoyable to the utmost.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="也许，一整天的做客都不会再有这样快乐的事了。当然，眼下这半个钟头也不该这样快活。不过，爱玛一看见韦斯顿夫人——一见到她的笑脸，碰到她的手，听到她的声音，心里就感到乐滋滋的，决计尽量抛开埃尔顿先生的古怪行为和其他不称心的事，痛痛快快地玩它一番。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">With such sensations, Mr. Elton's civilities were dreadfully ill-timed; but she had the comfort of appearing very polite, while feeling very cross -- and of thinking that the rest of the visit could not possibly pass without bringing forward the same information again, or the substance of it, from the open-hearted Mr. Weston. -- So it proved; -- for when happily released from Mr. Elton, and seated by Mr. Weston, at dinner, he made use of the very first interval in the cares of hospitality, the very first leisure from the saddle of mutton, to say to her,</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱玛如此心荡神驰，埃尔顿先生还来献殷勤，未免太不是时候。不过，使她感到欣慰的是，她尽管心里很气恼，外表却装得挺客气——再说韦斯顿先生为人直率，在她做客期间，想必还会重新提起这一消息，起码说说大概意思。果不其然。到吃饭时，她侥幸地摆脱了埃尔顿先生，坐到了韦斯顿先生身边。就在吃羊脊肉的当儿，韦斯顿先生趁不用关照客人的间隙，对她说道：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now, it so happened that in spite of Emma's resolution of never marrying, there was something in the name, in the idea of Mr. Frank Churchill, which always interested her. She had frequently thought -- especially since his father's marriage with Miss Taylor -- that if she were to marry, he was the very person to suit her in age, character and condition. He seemed by this connexion between the families, quite to belong to her. She could not but suppose it to be a match that every body who knew them must think of. That Mr. and Mrs. Weston did think of it, she was very strongly persuaded; and though not meaning to be induced by him, or by any body else, to give up a situation which she believed more replete with good than any she could change it for, she had a great curiosity to see him, a decided intention of finding him pleasant, of being liked by him to a certain degree, and a sort of pleasure in the idea of their being coupled in their friends' imaginations.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽说爱玛打定主意一辈子不结婚，但是一听到弗兰克·邱吉尔先生的名字，一想到他这个人，她总要为之怦然心动。她经常在想——特别是在韦斯顿先生和泰勒小姐结婚后——如果她真要结婚，从年龄、性情和家境来看，跟她最相配的就是弗兰克了。鉴于她家与韦斯顿先生家的特殊关系，弗兰克似乎更应该属于她了。她不由得在想，但凡认识他们俩的人，都会把他们视为天生的一对。她坚信韦斯顿夫妇想到了这件事。虽说她小想因为受到弗兰克或别人的诱惑，而舍弃一个在她看来说什么也换不来的美满家庭，但她却很想见见他，很想体验一下他多么讨人喜欢，感受一下讨他喜欢的滋味；一想到朋友们把他们看成天生的一对，心里不禁乐滋滋的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">`Yes, she would be, but that she thinks there will be another put-off. She does not depend upon his coming so much as I do: but she does not know the parties so well as I do. The case, you see, is -- (but this is quite between ourselves: I did not mention a syllable of it in the other room. There are secrets in all families, you know) -- The case is, that a party of friends are invited to pay a visit at Enscombe in January; and that Frank's coming depends upon their being put off. If they are not put off, he cannot stir. But I know they will, because it is a family that a certain lady, of some consequence, at Enscombe, has a particular dislike to: and though it is thought necessary to invite them once in two or three years, they always are put off when it comes to the point. I have not the smallest doubt of the issue. I am as confident of seeing Frank here before the middle of January, as I am of being here myself: but your good friend there (nodding towards the upper end of the table) has so few vagaries herself, and has been so little used to them at Hartfield, that she cannot calculate on their effects, as I have been long in the practice of doing.'</div>

I used to think she was not capable of being fond of any body, except herself: but she has always been kind to him (in her way -- allowing for little whims and caprices, and expecting every thing to be as she likes). And it is no small credit, in my opinion, to him, that he should excite such an affection; for, though I would not say it to any body else, she has no more heart than a stone to people in general; and the devil of a temper.'</div>

To be constantly living with an ill-tempered person, must be dreadful. It is what we happily have never known any thing of; but it must be a life of misery.

It depends entirely upon his aunt's spirits and pleasure; in short, upon her temper. To you -- to my two daughters -- I may venture on the truth.

She should then have heard more: Mrs. Weston would speak to her, with a degree of unreserve which she would not hazard with Isabella; and, she really believed, would scarcely try to conceal any thing relative to the Churchills from her, excepting those views on the young man, of which her own imagination had already given her such instinctive knowledge. But at present there was nothing more to be said. Mr. Woodhouse very soon followed them into the drawing-room. To be sitting long after dinner, was a confinement that he could not endure. Neither wine nor conversation was any thing to him; and gladly did he move to those with whom he was always comfortable.</div>
