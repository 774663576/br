He wanted his paints back, and he decided to go down and see if he could find them. He let P. T. out of the shed and gave the dog a half piece of bread.</div>

<div class="line_en">He woke up Saturday morning with a dull headache. It was still early, but he got up. He wanted to do the milking. His father had done it ever since Thursday night, but he wanted to go back to it, to somehow make things normal again. He shut P.

<div class="line_en">It was a beautiful spring morning. Early wildflowers were dotting the deep green of the fields, and the sky was clean and blue. The creek had fallen well below the bank and seemed less terrifying than before. A large branch was washed up into the bank, and he hauled it up to the narrowest place and laid it bank to bank. He stepped on it, and it seemed firm, so he crossed on it, foot over foot, to the other side, grabbing the smaller branches which grew out from the main one toward the opposite bank to keep his balance. There was no sign of his paints.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那是一个美丽的春晨。清晨开放的野花，点缀着深绿的田野，蔚蓝的天空上飘着几朵白云。小溪的水位降了下去，露出了浅滩，显得没有那么可怕了。他把一根被溪水冲到岸边的很大的树枝拖到了溪流最窄的地方，架起了一座简易的桥。他踩了上去，树枝依旧很牢固，于是他一步一步，扶着树枝上的侧枝，走向了对岸。没有任何颜料的迹象。">查看中文翻译</div>

The current carried him past Jess, but he made it safely to the bank and ran back, shaking great drops of cold water on Jess.</div>

<div class="line_en">They went into the castle stronghold. It was dark and damp, but there was no evidence there to suggest that the queen had died. He felt the need to do something fitting. But Leslie was not here to tell him what it was. The anger which had possessed him yesterday flared up again. Leslie. I'm just a dumb dodo, and you know it! What am I supposed to do? The coldness inside of him had moved upward into his throat constricting it. He swallowed several times. It occurred to him that he probably had cancer of the throat. Wasn't that one of the seven deadly signs? Difficulty in swallowing. He began to sweat. He didn't want to die. Lord, he was just ten years old. He had hardly begun to live.</div>

<div class="line_en">"OK, May Belle." The words came out more steadily than he felt. "Just hold still. I'll get you." He was not sure the branch would hold the weight of them both. He looked down at the water. It was low enough for him to walk across, but still swift. Suppose it swept him off his feet. He decided for the branch. He inched out on it until he was close enough to touch her. He'd have to get her back to the home side of the creek. "OK," he said. "Now, back up."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没事，梅宝。”他说出这些话比自己感觉的要沉稳。“抓住别动。我过去接住你。”他不知道树枝能否经受他们两人的重量。他往下看着河水。水浅到他可以涉水过去，但仍然很疾。他料想河水能淹没他的双脚。他决定顺着树枝过去。他一寸寸地前移，直到近得足够接触到她。他不得不将她带回到小溪边回家的那一岸。“好了，”他说。“现在，往回退。”">查看中文翻译</div>

Maybe she was already at school -- Bill had dropped her off, as he did some days when she was late for the bus -- but then when Jess came into the room, her desk was no longer there.

<div class="line_en">He thought about it all day, how before Leslie came, he had been a nothing -- a stupid, weird little kid who drew funny pictures and chased around a cow field trying to act big -- trying to hide a whole mob of foolish little fears running riot inside his gut.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他整天都在想着这些事，在莱斯利到来之前他什么都不是——一个愚蠢的、古怪的小孩，画着有趣的画，绕着奶牛场奔跑，想成为大人物——想隐藏他内心狂乱愚蠢的恐惧。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was Leslie who had taken him from the cow pasture into Terabithia and turned him into a king. He had thought that was it. Wasn't king the best you could be? Now it occurred to him that perhaps Terabithia was like a castle where you came to be knighted. After you stayed for a while and grew strong you had to move on. For hadn't Leslie, even in Terabithia, tried to push back the walls of his mind and make him see beyond to the shining world -- huge and terrible and beautiful and very fragile? (Handle with care -- everything -- even the predators.)</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="是莱斯利把他从奶牛场带到了特雷比西亚，让他成为一个国王。他曾经以为本来就该那样。国王不就是你能成为的最好的身份？现在他明白了，特雷比西亚就像是一座授予你爵位的城堡。当你呆了一段时间变得强大时，你必须前进。假如没有莱斯利，就算是在特雷比西亚，还能够推倒心中的墙、让他把这闪耀的世界——庞大、可怕、美丽并且脆弱的世界看得更远？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes'm." He couldn't think of anything else to say. Maybe some day when he was grown, he would write her a letter and tell her that Leslie Burke had thought she was a great teacher or something. Leslie wouldn't mind. Sometimes like the Barbie doll you need to give people something that's for them, not just something that makes you feel good giving it. Because Mrs. Myers had helped him already by understanding that he would never forget Leslie.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好的。”他想不出其他的话来回答。也许有一天当他长大了，他会给她写一封信，告诉她莱斯利·伯克认为她是一个非常好的老师什么的。莱斯利不会介意的。有时候就跟芭比娃娃一样，你需要给别人一些他们想要的东西，而不仅仅是你自以为对他们好的东西。因为梅耶斯夫人已经帮助了他，理解了他永远不会忘记莱斯利。">查看中文翻译</div>
