But now eight days have passed. It is time for you to go."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“在你的丈夫去世之后，我之所以允许你继续来这里，是因为我认为工作会把你从悲痛中解脱出来。我觉得在那个时候你绝不适合长途跋涉只身回到香港。而闷在家里无所事事，沉溺伤怀，相信对你也不会有任何好处。但是现在已经八天过去了，是你离开这儿的时候了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"We are all very grateful for what you have done for us," answered the Superior, with a slight smile, "but now that the epidemic is waning the risk of coming here is not so great and I am expecting two sisters from Canton. They should be here very shortly and when they arrive I do not think that I shall be able to make any use of your services."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们十分感谢你所做的一切。”修道院长微笑着说道，“如今瘟疫已经有所缓和，此地也不如从前危险了，所以广东的两个姐妹会赶过来帮忙。她们会很快赶到，我想她们到了以后你就没有留在这里的必要了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Kitty's heart sank. The Mother Superior's tone admitted of no reply; she knew her well enough to know that she would be insensible to entreaty. That she found it necessary to reason with Kitty had brought into her voice a note, if hardly of irritation, at least of the peremptoriness which might lead to it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凯蒂心里一沉，修道院长的声调显然表示此事绝无回旋的余地，而以她一贯的铁石心肠，即使再三恳求想必也是无济于事。她的声音带有与人论理时的不容分说的专横气势，使人觉得如若再有辩解她就必将发作似的。">查看中文翻译</div>

Mr. Waddington has arranged with Colonel Yü to give you a strong escort so that you will be perfectly safe on the journey, and he has arranged for bearers and coolies. The amah will go with you and arrangements will be made at the cities you pass through. In fact, everything possible for your comfort has been done."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“即便他没有此意，我也一样认为有必要向他告知我的想法。”修道院长亲切地说，“以目前的情况，你绝不能再久留此地，而应该和你的妈妈待在一起。韦丁顿先生已经叫余团长专门安排人护送你回去，他自己也为你找好了轿夫和苦役。你的女佣会随你一同回去，路上的衣食起居由她负责安排。事实是，一切利于你行程的，他们统统安排好了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Kitty was conscious of a relaxation in the Superior's demeanour. She saw that Kitty was prepared to yield and unconsciously she assumed a more gracious tone. Kitty's sense of humour was acute and her eyes twinkled as she reflected that even the saints liked to have their own way.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凯蒂察觉到修道院长像是松了口气，她看到凯蒂打算屈服了，便不自觉地换了更为和蔼的声调。凯蒂敏感地洞察幽默的能力发挥了作用，她的眼里闪烁着光芒，心中暗想即便是圣人也难免有喜怒形于色的时候。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Don't think that I fail to appreciate the goodness of your heart, my dear child, and the admirable charity which makes you unwilling to abandon your self-imposed duties."</div>

<div class="line_en">Kitty stared straight in front of her. She faintly shrugged her shoulders. She knew that she could ascribe to herself no such exalted virtues. She wanted to stay because she had nowhere else to go. It was a curious sensation this, that nobody in the world cared two straws whether she was alive or dead.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凯蒂目光直直地看着前方，微微耸了耸肩膀。她知道修道院长的评价她是受不起的，她之所以想留下来是因为她别无他处可去。这个世界上没人关心她是死是活，想到这个真是会给人一种奇特的感受。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Out of her own wounded feelings emerged the desire in Kitty's mind, malicious perhaps, to seek the joint in the armour of faith which rendered the nuns so aloofly immune to all the natural feelings. She wanted to see whether there was left in the Superior any of the weakness of humanity.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="受伤的自尊在凯蒂心里激起了一个狡猾的企图，她觉得信仰的外衣虽然使这群嬷嬷远离了凡尘的七情六欲，但此刻或许可以在这套外衣上发现一些破口。她要看看修道院长的身上是否真的不留一点俗世的残余。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was a brief silence and then the Mother Superior, assuming a lighter manner, smiled.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="短暂的沉默之后，修道院长的神态缓和了下来，对着凯蒂露出了微笑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She rose, and, with the easy dignity which her voluminous habit could not conceal, left the room. In a moment Sister St Joseph came in. She was come to say good-bye. She hoped that Kitty would have a pleasant journey; she would be quite safe, for Colonel Yü was sending a strong escort with her; and the sisters constantly did the journey alone and no harm came to them. And did she like the sea? Mon Dieu, how ill she was when there was a storm in the Indian Ocean, Madame her mother would be pleased to see her daughter, and she must take care of herself; after all she had another little soul in her care now, and they would all pray for her; she would pray constantly for her and the dear little baby and for the soul of the poor, brave doctor. She was voluble, kindly, and affectionate; and yet Kitty was deeply conscious that for Sister St Joseph (her gaze intent on eternity) she was but a wraith without body or substance. She had a wild impulse to seize the stout, good-natured nun by the shoulders and shake her, crying: "Don't you know that I'm a human being, unhappy and alone, and I want comfort and sympathy and encouragement; oh, can't you turn a minute away from God and give me a little compassion; not the Christian compassion that you have for all suffering things, but just human compassion for me?" The thought brought a smile to Kitty's lips: how very surprised Sister St Joseph would be! She would certainly be convinced of what now she only suspected, that all English people were mad.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="修道院长站起身来，以久已养成习惯的尊贵姿态走出门去。不一会儿圣约瑟姐妹进来了，她是来跟凯蒂道别的。她祝愿凯蒂旅途愉快，劝她不必为路上的安全担心，因为余团长派了精干的护卫陪着她回去。姐妹们也常常只身出远门儿，从来没有出过事。她问凯蒂喜欢大海吗。上帝呀，那回在印度洋上遇见了风暴，晕船差点要了圣约瑟姐妹的命。令堂见到她的女儿一定会高兴坏了。凯蒂务必要照顾好自己，毕竟她身上还怀着另外一个小小的灵魂呢。姐妹们会不停地为她、她可爱的小宝贝，还有可怜而勇敢的医生的灵魂祈祷。她滔滔不绝、兴高采烈地讲了半天，但是凯蒂深深地感到对于圣约瑟姐妹（她的全部心思都盯在灵魂不朽上了）来说，她不过是一个脱离了血肉之躯的灵魂而已。她几乎想疯狂地抓住这位好脾气的胖嬷嬷的肩头，边摇晃她的脑袋边喊：“你知不知道我是一个有血有肉、不幸而孤独的人？我需要安慰、同情，我需要鼓励。呃，你就不能先忘了你那个上帝，给我一点点人的怜悯吗？我要的不是你们基督徒普度众生的大慈大悲，我仅仅想要一个凡人的怜悯。”这个想法使凯蒂不禁微笑起来：圣约瑟姐妹听到之后该有多么惊讶！她一定可以把心中那个唯一悬而未决的疑案盖棺定论了——所有的英国人都是疯子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sister St Joseph suggested that Kitty would like to see how beautifully the work was done and the Mother Superior with an indulgent, deprecating smile untied the parcel. The handkerchiefs were of very fine lawn and the initials embroidered in a complicated cypher were surmounted by a crown of strawberry leaves. When Kitty had properly admired the workmanship, the handkerchiefs were wrapped up again and the parcel handed to her. Sister St Joseph, with an "Eh bien, Madame, je vous quitte" and a repetition of her polite and impersonal salutations, went away. Kitty realized that this was the moment to take her leave of the Superior. She thanked her for her kindness to her. They walked together along the bare, whitewashed corridors.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="圣约瑟姐妹说凯蒂一定要看看手绢的做工是多么漂亮，修道院长便略有不甘但又颇为仁慈地解开了包裹。看手绢的质地显然是用上等细布做成的，人名缩写是由华丽难辨的花体字所绣，字母上头还绣上了草莓叶子编成的花冠。凯蒂还在对手绢的绣工赞叹不已时，包裹又重新系好了，并塞到了她的手上。圣约瑟姐妹慨叹一句“我的女士，我不得不离开你了”，又把那些礼貌而淡漠的道别话说了一遍，然后就出去了。凯蒂意识到该是院长送客的时候了，便对院长长久以来的照顾表示感谢。两人沿着空荡荡的白色走廊走了出去。">查看中文翻译</div>

But they reached the little, unpretentious door of the convent. To Kitty's surprise the Mother Superior took her in her arms and kissed her. The pressure of her pale lips on Kitty's cheeks, she kissed her first on one side and then on the other, was so unexpected that it made her flush and inclined to cry.</div>
