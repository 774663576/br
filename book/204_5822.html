<div class="line_en">It was the same in my dream. I did not feel any pain, but it seemed as though with my shot everything within me was shaken and everything was suddenly dimmed, and it grew horribly black around me. I seemed to be blinded, and it benumbed, and I was lying on something hard, stretched on my back; I saw nothing, and could not make the slightest movement. People were walking and shouting around me, the captain bawled, the landlady shrieked -- and suddenly another break and I was being carried in a closed coffin. And I felt how the coffin was shaking and reflected upon it, and for the first time the idea struck me that I was dead, utterly dead, I knew it and had no doubt of it, I could neither see nor move and yet I was feeling and reflecting. But I was soon reconciled to the position, and as one usually does in a dream, accepted the facts without disputing them.</div>

<div class="line_en">In dreams you sometimes fall from a height, or are stabbed, or beaten, but you never feel pain unless, perhaps, you really bruise yourself against the bedstead, then you feel pain and almost always wake up from it.</div>

<div class="line_en">I have mentioned that I dropped asleep unawares and even seemed to be still reflecting on the same subjects. I suddenly dreamt that I picked up the revolver and aimed it straight at my heart -- my heart, and not my head; and I had determined beforehand to fire at my head, at my right temple. After aiming at my chest I waited a second or two, and suddenly my candle, my table, and the wall in front of me began moving and heaving. I made haste to pull the trigger.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我说过，我在不知不觉中睡着了，仿佛还在思考着那些问题。我忽然梦见，我坐在那里拿起手枪来直对着心脏——是心脏，不是脑袋；以前我是打算一定对准脑袋，正对右太阳穴开枪的。我对准胸膛等了一、二秒钟，忽然房里的蜡烛、桌子和墙壁全都在我眼前晃动、旋转起来。我连忙开了一枪。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And now I was buried in the earth. They all went away, I was left alone, utterly alone. I did not move. Whenever before I had imagined being buried the one sensation I associated with the grave was that of damp and cold. So now I felt that I was very cold, especially the tips of my toes, but I felt nothing else. I lay still, strange to say I expected nothing, accepting without dispute that a dead man had nothing to expect. But it was damp. I don't know how long a time passed -- whether an hour or several days, or many days.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是，他们把我埋入土中。他们都走了，剩下我一个人，孤零零的一个人。我不能活动。过去不是在梦中时，我常想我会怎样被埋入坟墓，由坟墓联想到的不过是潮湿和寒冷而已，眼下我可真的感到了寒冷，尤其是脚趾尖，不过再没有别的什么感觉了。我躺着，奇怪的是无所期待，心平气和地承认死人是没有什么可盼望的了。可就是感到潮湿。我不知躺了多久，——一个小时，或者几天，也许有好多天了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And all at once, not with my voice, but with my entire being, I called upon the power that was responsible for all that was happening to me:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我突然祈求起来，但不是用声音，因为我是不能动弹的，而是用我的整个身心，向着使我变成这样的主宰者祈求：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But all at once a drop of water fell on my closed left eye, making its way through the coffin lid; it was followed a minute later by a second, then a minute later by a third -- and so on, regularly every minute. There was a sudden glow of profound indignation in my heart, and I suddenly felt in it a pang of physical pain. "That's my wound," I thought; "that's the bullet…" And drop after drop every minute kept falling on my closed eyelid.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但忽然间，从棺盖上渗进来一滴水落到我闭着的左眼上，一分钟后又一滴，又一分钟后第三滴，就这样连连不断，每分钟落下来一滴。一股无比的愤懑从我心底升起，我感到心底一阵疼痛。“这是伤口”，我想了想。“是枪伤，里面还有一粒子弹……”水还在滴落，每分钟一滴，径直掉到我那只闭着的眼睛上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I made this appeal and held my peace. There was a full minute of unbroken silence and again another drop fell, but I knew with infinite unshakable certainty that everything would change immediately. And behold my grave suddenly was rent asunder, that is, I don't know whether it was opened or dug up, but I was caught up by some dark and unknown being and we found ourselves in space.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我祈求之后不再说话，深深的沉默几乎持续了整整一分钟。又掉下一滴水，但我知道，而且深知和确信，一切都将马上发生变化。这不，我的坟墓真的突然裂开了。也就是说我不知道坟墓到底是被打开的还是被掘开的，不过，我被一个没有见过的黑怪物抓住，于是我们不知不觉地来到了天空中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I suddenly regained my sight. It was the dead of night, and never, never had there been such darkness. We were flying through space far away from the earth. I did not question the being who was taking me; I was proud and waited. I assured myself that I was not afraid, and was thrilled with ecstasy at the thought that I was not afraid. I do not know how long we were flying, I cannot imagine; it happened as it always does in dreams when you skip over space and time, and the laws of thought and existence, and only pause upon the points for which the heart yearns. I remember that I suddenly saw in the darkness a star.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我蓦地发现：这是一个深夜，一个前所未有的漆黑漆黑的夜晚！我们在远离地球的太空中疾飞。我对抓我的怪物什么也不问，我在等待着，我非常高傲。我深信自己不会害怕，而且一想到不会害怕时，我便兴奋不已。我记不起飞行了多长时间，而且也想象不出来，因为一切都像平常做梦时一样，当你跨越时空，超越存在和理智的规律时，你就只会在心灵的憧憬点上停下来。我记得，我在漆黑中忽然看见一颗小星星。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“不管你是什么人，但如果有你在，如果有比眼下发生的更合乎情理的事，那么你就让它也在这儿出现吧。而如果因为我缺乏理智而自杀，你要报复我，让我往后的日子过得难堪、荒唐，那么就请注意，我在任何时候所遭受的任何苦难都将无法与我要默默地承受的那种羞愧相比，哪怕那苦难要绵延千百万年！……”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And here I was in the hands of a creature not human, of course, but yet living, existing. "And so there is life beyond the grave," I thought with the strange frivolity one has in dreams. But in its inmost depth my heart remained unchanged. "And if I have got to exist again," I thought, "and live once more under the control of some irresistible power, I won't be vanquished and humiliated."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="而今我落在了怪物的手中，它当然不是人，但它是存在着的，是活着的：“啊，原来坟墓的外面也还有生命哩！”我像做梦似 的胡思乱想，不过我的心底依然如故。“如果复生，”我想，“重又生活在某人的旨意下，那么，我是不会去接受别人的控制与凌辱的！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Is that Sirius?" I asked impulsively, though I had not meant to ask questions. "No, that is the star you saw between the clouds when you were coming home," the being who was carrying me replied. I knew that it had something like a human face. Strange to say, I did not like that being, in fact I felt an intense aversion for it. I had expected complete non-existence, and that was why I had put a bullet through my heart.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这是天狼星吧？”我骤然忍不住问道，因为我本来是什么也不想打听的。“不，这就是你回家时从云层间看到的那颗星星。”那个抓我的怪物答道。这时我才看到，这怪物有一张仿佛与人一样的面孔。奇怪的是，我却不喜欢这怪物，甚至对它感到十分厌恶。我所期待的是彻底的虚无，正因为如此，我才对着自己的心脏开枪。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You know that I am afraid of you and despise me for that," I said suddenly to my companion, unable to refrain from the humiliating question which implied a confession, and feeling my humiliation stab my heart as with a pin. He did not answer my question, but all at once I felt that he was not even despising me, but was laughing at me and had no compassion for me, and that our journey had an unknown and mysterious object that concerned me only. Fear was growing in my heart. Something was mutely and painfully communicated to me from my silent companion, and permeated my whole being.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你知道我害怕你，所以你看不起我。”我忽然不顾体面地对我的旅伴提出问题说，这问题含有自我表白的意味，因而我的心 底像被针刺一样感到屈辱。他没有回答我，但我马上觉得，并没有人鄙视我，耻笑我，也没有人可怜我，同时也发觉，我们旅行的目的不清楚而且神秘莫测，不过只与我一人有关。一种恐惧感在我心中慢慢升起。默不作声的旅伴身上的一种东西在无声地但却痛苦地感染着我，仿佛在我身上涌动。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“而如果这就是太阳，如果这确实就是我们的那个太阳，”我高呼起来，“那么，地球又在哪儿呢？”旅伴就把一颗小星星指给我看，那小星星在黑暗中闪烁着绿光。我们径直朝它飞去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We were flying through dark, unknown space. I had for some time lost sight of the constellations familiar to my eyes. I knew that there were stars in the heavenly spaces the light of which took thousands or millions of years to reach the earth. Perhaps we were already flying through those spaces. I expected something with a terrible anguish that tortured my heart.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们在昏暗而神秘的太空中急飞。我已经很久没有见到那些熟悉的星星了。我知道，太空中有些星星的光要数千年甚至数百万年才能到达地球上，我们也许已经飞过了这一个距离。在极度揪心的苦闷中我似乎在期待着某种东西。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And suddenly I was thrilled by a familiar feeling that stirred me to the depths: I suddenly caught sight of our sun! I knew that it could not be our sun, that gave life to our earth, and that we were an infinite distance from our sun, but for some reason I knew in my whole being that it was a sun exactly like ours, a duplicate of it. A sweet, thrilling feeling resounded with ecstasy in my heart: the kindred power of the same light which had given me light stirred an echo in my heart and awakened it, and I had a sensation of life, the old life of the past for the first time since I had been in the grave.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="刹那间，一种熟悉的扣人心弦的感觉使我震荡：我忽然看见了我们的太阳。我知道，这不可能是那个养育过我们地球的太阳，我们距离我们的太阳无限的远，但不知为什么，我的整个身心却感到，这个太阳和我们的那个太阳一模一样，是我们太阳的复制品，是我们太阳的孪生兄弟。动人心弦的甜美感在我心底激起一阵欣慰：给我生命的亲切的阳光的威力在我心中回荡，使我心灵复苏，我被埋进坟墓后，第一次感到有了生机，原先的那种生机。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"And are such repetitions possible in the universe? Can that be the law of Nature?… And if that is an earth there, can it be just the same earth as ours… just the same, as poor, as unhappy, but precious and beloved for ever, arousing in the most ungrateful of her children the same poignant love for her that we feel for our earth?" I cried out, shaken by irresistible, ecstatic love for the old familiar earth which I had left. The image of the poor child whom I had repulsed flashed through my mind.</div>

<div class="line_en">But I have never, never ceased to love that earth, and perhaps on the very night I parted from it I loved it more than ever. Is there suffering upon this new earth? On our earth we can only love with suffering and through suffering. We cannot love otherwise, and we know of no other sort of love. I want suffering in order to love. I long, I thirst, this very instant, to kiss with tears the earth that I have left, and I don't want, I won't accept life on any other!"</div>

<div class="line_en">"You shall see it all," answered my companion, and there was a note of sorrow in his voice. But we were rapidly approaching the planet. It was growing before my eyes; I could already distinguish the ocean, the outline of Europe; and suddenly a feeling of a great and holy jealousy glowed in my heart. "How can it be repeated and what for? I love and can love only that earth which I have left, stained with my blood, when, in my ingratitude, I quenched my life with a bullet in my heart.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“一切你都会看到的，”我的旅伴回答说。听得出来，他的话中夹带着忧伤。我们在迅速地靠近那颗行星，行星在我眼中越变越大，我已经分辨出了海洋和欧洲的轮廓，一种奇特的伟大而纯洁的妒意突然在我心间涌起：“怎么可能有一模一样的东西呢？而且又为了什么呢？我爱，只能爱我离开的那个地球，我这个忘恩负义的人向心房开枪结束生命时，我的血就洒在了那上面。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But my companion had already left me. I suddenly, quite without noticing how, found myself on this other earth, in the bright light of a sunny day, fair as paradise. I believe I was standing on one of the islands that make up on our globe the Greek archipelago, or on the coast of the mainland facing that archipelago. Oh, everything was exactly as it is with us, only everything seemed to have a festive radiance, the splendour of some great, holy triumph attained at last. The caressing sea, green as emerald, splashed softly upon the shore and kissed it with manifest, almost conscious love. The tall, lovely trees stood in all the glory of their blossom, and their innumerable leaves greeted me, I am certain, with their soft, caressing rustle and seemed to articulate words of love. The grass glowed with bright and fragrant flowers. Birds were flying in flocks in the air, and perched fearlessly on my shoulders and arms and joyfully struck me with their darling, fluttering wings.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是，我的旅伴已经把我扔下。我好像毫无感觉地霎时间就来到了另一个地球上——一个晴天丽日下的人间天堂。我好像站在我们地球上希腊群岛中的一个小岛上，又好像是与这些岛屿毗连的大陆沿海的某个地方。啊，一切的一切都完全像我们地球上一样，可就是这儿似乎到处是一派节日的气氛，洋溢着伟大、圣洁、最后胜利的欢乐。温柔、碧绿的大海轻轻地拍打着堤岸，环抱着毫不掩饰的几乎是属意专一的爱恋亲吻着海岸。树木参天，娟秀葱茏，片片绿叶轻柔、亲昵地沙沙响，我感觉它们像是在诉说情话迎接我的到来。茂密的野草开满鲜花，馨香四溢。一群群的鸟儿在天空中飞过，毫不畏惧地落在我的肩上、手上，抖动着可爱的小翅膀，喜滋滋地拍打我。">查看中文翻译</div>

The children of the sun, the children of their sun -- oh, how beautiful they were! Never had I seen on our own earth such beauty in mankind. Only perhaps in our children, in their earliest years, one might find, some remote faint reflection of this beauty. The eyes of these happy people shone with a clear brightness. Their faces were radiant with the light of reason and fullness of a serenity that comes of perfect understanding, but those faces were gay; in their words and voices there was a note of childlike joy.</div>

They lived just in such a paradise as that in which, according to all the legends of mankind, our first parents lived before they sinned; the only difference was that all this earth was the same paradise. These people, laughing joyfully, thronged round me and caressed me; they took me home with them, and each of them tried to reassure me.
