<div class="line_en">He thought with a smile of his uncle's remark. It was lucky that the turn of his mind tended to flippancy. He had begun to realise what a great loss he had sustained in the death of his father and mother. That was one of the differences in his life which prevented him from seeing things in the same way as other people. The love of parents for their children is the only emotion which is quite disinterested. Among strangers he had grown up as best he could, but he had seldom been used with patience or forbearance. He prided himself on his self-control. It had been whipped into him by the mockery of his fellows. Then they called him cynical and callous. He had acquired calmness of demeanour and under most circumstances an unruffled exterior, so that now he could not show his feelings. People told him he was unemotional; but he knew that he was at the mercy of his emotions: an accidental kindness touched him so much that sometimes he did not venture to speak in order not to betray the unsteadiness of his voice. He remembered the bitterness of his life at school, the humiliation which he had endured, the banter which had made him morbidly afraid of making himself ridiculous; and he remembered the loneliness he had felt since, faced with the world, the disillusion and the disappointment caused by the difference between what it promised to his active imagination and what it gave. But notwithstanding he was able to look at himself from the outside and smile with amusement.</div>

<div class="line_en">Taking the paper with him Mr. Carey retired to his study. Philip changed his chair for that in which his uncle had been sitting (it was the only comfortable one in the room), and looked out of the window at the pouring rain. Even in that sad weather there was something restful about the green fields that stretched to the horizon. There was an intimate charm in the landscape which he did not remember ever to have noticed before. Two years in France had opened his eyes to the beauty of his own countryside.</div>

<div class="line_en">When Philip ceased to believe in Christianity he felt that a great weight was taken from his shoulders; casting off the responsibility which weighed down every action, when every action was infinitely important for the welfare of his immortal soul, he experienced a vivid sense of liberty. But he knew now that this was an illusion. When he put away the religion in which he had been brought up, he had kept unimpaired the morality which was part and parcel of it. He made up his mind therefore to think things out for himself. He determined to be swayed by no prejudices. He swept away the virtues and the vices, the established laws of good and evil, with the idea of finding out the rules of life for himself. He did not know whether rules were necessary at all. That was one of the things he wanted to discover. Clearly much that seemed valid seemed so only because he had been taught it from his earliest youth. He had read a number of books, but they did not help him much, for they were based on the morality of Christianity; and even the writers who emphasised the fact that they did not believe in it were never satisfied till they had framed a system of ethics in accordance with that of the Sermon on the Mount. It seemed hardly worth while to read a long volume in order to learn that you ought to behave exactly like everybody else. Philip wanted to find out how he ought to behave, and he thought he could prevent himself from being influenced by the opinions that surrounded him. But meanwhile he had to go on living, and, until he formed a theory of conduct, he made himself a provisional rule.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当时刚刚脱离基督教的菲利普曾一度觉得满身轻松，之前做每件事时都要担惊受怕，生怕触犯了戒规害得灵魂无法永生。可这种负担终于从他肩上卸去了。他以为自己终于感受到了自由的美好，可现在却发现这不过是一种错觉。他是在宗教的熏陶下长大的，尽管放弃了心中的宗教意识，但还会无意识地小心呵护着道德观念——这正是宗教的一部分。他决定不受任何偏见左右，独立地思考问题，把善恶全都抛在脑后，也不再顾虑什么是对，什么是错。他想找到属于自己的人生规则。可规则在人生中真的是必不可少的吗？这也是他想潜心探索的问题。显然世上很多事看似顺理成章，原因不过是由于我们打小受到的教育引导罢了。他读了那么多书，可并没有从中受益许多。因为这些书中的几乎所有观点都以基督教的道德观为基础。即使有些作者口口声声说自己不信基督，但他们的书里终究还是会构建出一个与登山宝训不谋而合的道德论。如果只是为了跟在别人身后亦步亦趋、随波逐流，还不如省下啃书本的时间做点别的。菲利普想确定未来的方向，他相信自己能够不受舆论的影响。但同时又不得不继续生活。在总结出一套完整的行为规范前，他给自己先立了一条临时规则。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He thought the best thing he had gained in Paris was a complete liberty of spirit, and he felt himself at last absolutely free. In a desultory way he had read a good deal of philosophy, and he looked forward with delight to the leisure of the next few months. He began to read at haphazard. He entered upon each system with a little thrill of excitement, expecting to find in each some guide by which he could rule his conduct; he felt himself like a traveller in unknown countries and as he pushed forward the enterprise fascinated him; he read emotionally, as other men read pure literature, and his heart leaped as he discovered in noble words what himself had obscurely felt. His mind was concrete and moved with difficulty in regions of the abstract; but, even when he could not follow the reasoning, it gave him a curious pleasure to follow the tortuosities of thoughts that threaded their nimble way on the edge of the incomprehensible. Sometimes great philosophers seemed to have nothing to say to him, but at others he recognised a mind with which he felt himself at home. He was like the explorer in Central Africa who comes suddenly upon wide uplands, with great trees in them and stretches of meadow, so that he might fancy himself in an English park. He delighted in the robust common sense of Thomas Hobbes; Spinoza filled him with awe, he had never before come in contact with a mind so noble, so unapproachable and austere; it reminded him of that statue by Rodin, L'Age d'Airain, which he passionately admired; and then there was Hume: the scepticism of that charming philosopher touched a kindred note in Philip; and, revelling in the lucid style which seemed able to put complicated thought into simple words, musical and measured, he read as he might have read a novel, a smile of pleasure on his lips. But in none could he find exactly what he wanted. He had read somewhere that every man was born a Platonist, an Aristotelian, a Stoic, or an Epicurean; and the history of George Henry Lewes (besides telling you that philosophy was all moonshine) was there to show that the thought of each philospher was inseparably connected with the man he was. When you knew that you could guess to a great extent the philosophy he wrote. It looked as though you did not act in a certain way because you thought in a certain way, but rather that you thought in a certain way because you were made in a certain way. Truth had nothing to do with it. There was no such thing as truth. Each man was his own philosopher, and the elaborate systems which the great men of the past had composed were only valid for the writers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在巴黎的那段日子里，最让他视若珍宝的就是精神上的自由，他感到自己终于从牢笼里解放了。断断续续地读了很多关于哲学的书后，他满心期望能在接下来的几个月放松一把。他漫无目地地阅读，每翻开一本书心里都小小激动，想从中猎取一些待人接物的现成法则。他觉得自己像个置身于陌生国度的游客，不断向前，那股冒险的劲头让人着迷。他像别人研读纯粹的文学作品那样动情地读着，每每从慷慨激昂的文字里读出一些朦胧的情感，心都会怦怦跳个不停。他那专于具形概念的头脑一进入抽象的世界就重重受挫。尽管跟不上书里的逻辑，但还是能随着作者曲折迂回的思想在高深莫测的概念之林中敏捷穿梭。有时读到一些哲学家的理论时，他的心里起不了太大的波澜。但有时又能在其他著作里发现些说到他心坎的话。就像在非洲腹地探索时爬上了一座山。参天大树和一望无际的原野顿时在眼前铺陈开来，仿佛自己仍身处英国的大公园里，有种亲切而熟悉的感觉。托马斯·霍布斯上知天文、下通地理的才华让他兴奋非常。斯宾诺莎则让他又敬又怕，他未见过如此品德高尚、超凡脱俗、严格律己之人，不禁想起了自己所热爱的罗丹的雕像《青铜时代》。哲学家休谟充满魅力的怀疑论也激起了他心中的共鸣。休谟头脑明晰清楚，善于用简洁的语言表达复杂的思想，他的文字如音乐、似诗歌，充满了音律之美。菲利普面带微笑地读着他的书，仿佛在阅读一部引人入胜的小说。可惜的是，看过这些书，他却依然没有找到自己真正想找的东西。有本书里说，一个人究竟是柏拉图还是亚里士多德，究竟是斯多葛还是伊壁鸠鲁都是打出生就决定了的。乔治·亨利·刘易斯的一生（除了告诉你哲学家都是些满口大话之人外）说明了一个道理，每个哲学家的思想都带有鲜明的个人特点。知道了这一点，你就能把所有哲学家的思想猜个大概了。可以这样认为：似乎决定我们行事方式的不是我们的思维方式，而决定我们思维方式的正是我们的为人。这一切都无关乎真理。世上本没有真理。每个人都是自己的哲学家。昔日伟人精心总结的思想系统仅仅是对作家有意义罢了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The thing then was to discover what one was and one's system of philosophy would devise itself. It seemed to Philip that there were three things to find out: man's relation to the world he lives in, man's relation with the men among whom he lives, and finally man's relation to himself. He made an elaborate plan of study.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在我们知道，只要了解了一个人，那么关于他哲学体系的所有问题也自然会迎刃而解。菲利普认为想要了解一个人必须通过三种不同联系：他与其所生存世界的联系，他与身边人的联系，以及他与自己的联系。他制定了翔实的计划，决定按照这个思路潜心研究一番。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The advantage of living abroad is that, coming in contact with the manners and customs of the people among whom you live, you observe them from the outside and see that they have not the necessity which those who practise them believe. You cannot fail to discover that the beliefs which to you are self-evident to the foreigner are absurd. The year in Germany, the long stay in Paris, had prepared Philip to receive the sceptical teaching which came to him now with such a feeling of relief. He saw that nothing was good and nothing was evil; things were merely adapted to an end. He read The Origin of Species. It seemed to offer an explanation of much that troubled him. He was like an explorer now who has reasoned that certain natural features must present themselves, and, beating up a broad river, finds here the tributary that he expected, there the fertile, populated plains, and further on the mountains. When some great discovery is made the world is surprised afterwards that it was not accepted at once, and even on those who acknowledge its truth the effect is unimportant. The first readers of The Origin of Species accepted it with their reason; but their emotions, which are the ground of conduct, were untouched. Philip was born a generation after this great book was published, and much that horrified its contemporaries had passed into the feeling of the time, so that he was able to accept it with a joyful heart. He was intensely moved by the grandeur of the struggle for life, and the ethical rule which it suggested seemed to fit in with his predispositions. He said to himself that might was right. Society stood on one side, an organism with its own laws of growth and self-preservation, while the individual stood on the other. The actions which were to the advantage of society it termed virtuous and those which were not it called vicious. Good and evil meant nothing more than that. Sin was a prejudice from which the free man should rid himself. Society had three arms in its contest with the individual, laws, public opinion, and conscience: the first two could be met by guile, guile is the only weapon of the weak against the strong: common opinion put the matter well when it stated that sin consisted in being found out; but conscience was the traitor within the gates; it fought in each heart the battle of society, and caused the individual to throw himself, a wanton sacrifice, to the prosperity of his enemy. For it was clear that the two were irreconcilable, the state and the individual conscious of himself. That uses the individual for its own ends, trampling upon him if he thwarts it, rewarding him with medals, pensions, honours, when he serves it faithfully; this, strong only in his independence, threads his way through the state, for convenience' sake, paying in money or service for certain benefits, but with no sense of obligation; and, indifferent to the rewards, asks only to be left alone. He is the independent traveller, who uses Cook's tickets because they save trouble, but looks with good-humoured contempt on the personally conducted parties. The free man can do no wrong. He does everything he likes -- if he can. His power is the only measure of his morality. He recognises the laws of the state and he can break them without sense of sin, but if he is punished he accepts the punishment without rancour. Society has the power.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="旅居国外有一个好处，你大可从一个旁观者的视角出发，了解身边人的不同风俗习惯。因为你不像他们一样从小就对这些风俗习惯耳濡目染、深信不疑。这样一来就不用担心某些自以为不证自明的信仰在别人看来只是万分滑稽了。他在德国待了一年，又在巴黎生活了很久，学习起怀疑论的教义来自然非常从容、得心应手。世间万物无所谓善恶之分，其存在只是为适应环境使然。读了《物种起源》后，他似乎明白了许多之前一直困惑不解的道理。他就像个探险家，先推测出此地可能存在哪些自然现象，再逆着汹涌的河流一路向上，试图求证。果不其然，那里真的有一条支流。四周人烟稠密，沃野流金，远处群山峦峦，延绵不尽。说起过去的某些重大发现，世人总是震惊不已：为何当时没有人能够立即接受这条真理呢？为何那些接受了它的人也没有深受其影响呢？第一批阅读《物种起源》的读者怕是只接受了书中的道理，而没有从心底受其触动吧。可他们的情感才是行动的基础啊。菲利普这代人出生于《物种起源》出版之后的时代，经过时间的推移，那些曾经在人们之间引发轩然大波的见解现在大多已经为人所接受，所以菲利普才得以怀着轻松愉快的心情来阅读这本书。书中所描写的为了生存而做的壮烈斗争让他心神激荡，而其中提到的伦理准则也和他之前的想法不谋而合。他告诉自己力量才是王道。一边是社会——一个遵循着特有规律而自我发展、自我保护的独立有机体；另一边则是个人。凡是对社会有益的行为就被标榜为一种美德；而对社会不利的行为则要贴上罪恶的标签。善与恶无非就是这样来的。罪恶是自由的人们应该摆脱的一种偏见。社会有三把利剑专门用来对付人：法律、舆论和人们心中的道德良知。动动歪脑子，就能轻松避过前两把剑，这种诡计多端的小聪明是弱者战胜强者的唯一武器了。当公众舆论点明“纸是包不住火的”这一真理后，它也就光荣地完成了自己的使命。可道德良知是存在于每个人内心的叛徒，它身处敌营之中，逼得人不得不狼狈投降，为了社会的繁荣而牺牲自我。社会与个人的矛盾是无法调和的，两方心中也各自有数。一方面，社会利用个人的力量来达到自己的目的，企图违抗者，它将其践踏脚下。忠心侍从者，它以勋章、金钱、荣誉加以奖赏。另一方面，个人的唯一力量仅存在于其自身的独立性中，他们在社会里苟且生存，奉上人力或是财力只为给自己图个方便，毫无责任感这一说。他们不求奖赏，只求能不受打扰、不被干涉。独自行游至此的旅人，明明自己为了省事才按库克船长的地图一路远航，却不免还要善意地嘲笑那些由别人带领指路的人。自由的人是不会犯错的。他可以随心所欲地做自己想做而又能做成的事。他的力量是衡量自身道德水平的唯一标准。他知道社会上的所有条条框框，但却能毫无悔悟之心地反其道而行之，就算受到惩罚，也是平心静气，不会因此怨恨自己或他人。谁叫社会自有其势呢。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But if for the individual there was no right and no wrong, then it seemed to Philip that conscience lost its power. It was with a cry of triumph that he seized the knave and flung him from his breast. But he was no nearer to the meaning of life than he had been before. Why the world was there and what men had come into existence for at all was as inexplicable as ever. Surely there must be some reason. He thought of Cronshaw's parable of the Persian carpet. He offered it as a solution of the riddle, and mysteriously he stated that it was no answer at all unless you found it out for yourself.</div>
