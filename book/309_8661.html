<div class="line_en">When Himmel Street was cleared, Liesel Meminger had nowhere to go. She was the girl they referred to as "the one with the accordion," and she was taken to the police, who were in the throes of deciding what to do with her.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="走下警察局台阶的时候，伊尔莎·赫尔曼想帮她提琴盒，可是莉泽尔紧紧地将它抓在手里。沿着慕尼黑大街走出几个街区后，能看到遭到空袭的区域和幸免于难的区域间有条明显的分界线。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It would have been easy to say nothing, but Liesel had the opposite reaction to her devastation. She sat in the exquisite spare room of the mayor's house and spoke and spoke -- to herself -- well into the night. She ate very little. The only thing she didn't do at all was wash.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莉泽尔本可以一言不发，反倒轻松一些，但是面对灭顶之灾，她表现出了相反的反应。她坐在镇长家考究的客房里，不停地讲话，不停地自言自语，一直讲到深夜。她只吃了一点点东西，唯一没做的事情就是洗漱。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For four days, she carried around the remains of Himmel Street on the carpets and floorboards of 8 Grande Strasse. She slept a lot and didn't dream, and on most occasions she was sorry to wake up. Everything disappeared when she was asleep.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="四天来，她只是把希默尔街的余烬抖落到格兰德街八号的地毯和地板上。她睡得很多，从不做梦。醒过来的时候，她往往感到遗憾，因为只有睡着了，一切才会从眼前消失。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">People who were at the service of Hans and Rosa Hubermann always talked about the girl who stood there wearing a pretty dress and a layer of Himmel Street dirt. There was also a rumor that later in the day, she walked fully clothed into the Amper River and said something very strange.</div>

<div class="line_en">After that, there were weeks and months, and a lot of war. She remembered her books in the moments of worst sorrow, especially the ones that were made for her and the one that saved her life. One morning, in a renewed state of shock, she even walked back down to Himmel Street to find them, but nothing was left. There was no recovery from what had happened. That would take decades; it would take a long life.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="莉泽尔告诉他，自己亲吻了鲁迪的双唇。这虽然有点难为情，但她觉得亚力克斯听到这句话会高兴的。果然，他木头人般的脸上流下了泪水，同时露出呆板的微笑。我透过莉泽尔的双眼，看到了那片透着光亮的灰色天空。那是一个银色的午后。">查看中文翻译</div>
